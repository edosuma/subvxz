00:54.440 --> 00:59.514
...4 runs batted in. And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

00:59.920 --> 01:00.955
Reggie!

01:01.360 --> 01:04.590
Just listen to that crowd.
- Reggie!

01:07.400 --> 01:12.679
Come on, Reggie! Hit another homerun!
- Coop, he's already hit two.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.793
It's a high fly ball to right...

01:18.160 --> 01:19.673
That's way back

01:20.880 --> 01:22.711
and it's... gone.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.868
Reggie Jackson hits
his 3rd home run of the game.

01:38.600 --> 01:40.716
Good catch, Coop!
- I can't believe it!

01:41.120 --> 01:43.588
I totally had it,
but my glasses slipped.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.199
Remer, someday I'm gonna become
a big sports star. - Whatever you say.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.558
You just watch me, dude.

01:54.280 --> 01:58.159
There was a time in America
when contests of athletic prowess

01:58.560 --> 02:01.199
were a metaphor for the nobility of man.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.239
Historic moments,
forged by the love of the game,

02:04.640 --> 02:06.676
celebrated the human potential

02:07.080 --> 02:12.029
to achieve excellence. But as time passed
and the country neared the millennium,

02:12.440 --> 02:14.032
something went awry.

02:14.440 --> 02:19.195
Manning rolls right. He's got Plough
at the ten... Touchdown,

02:19.600 --> 02:20.828
Dallas.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.878
The ideal of sportsmanship

02:23.280 --> 02:27.751
began to take a back seat
to excessive celebration.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.554
The athletes caring less about playing
than planning the vulgar grandstanding

02:39.960 --> 02:45.353
that inevitably followed even the most
pedestrian of accomplishments.

02:45.760 --> 02:49.196
The games became
subordinate to the quest for money.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.709
Stadiums and arenas became no more

02:54.120 --> 02:55.599
than giant billboards

02:56.000 --> 02:58.309
to promote commercial products.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.959
Players sold their services
to the highest bidder,

03:03.360 --> 03:06.318
much like the hired guns
of the Old West.

03:06.720 --> 03:11.316
After playing for New England, San Diego,
Houston, St. Louis,

03:11.720 --> 03:15.508
a year for the Toronto Argonauts,
plus one season at the Desert Inn,

03:15.920 --> 03:19.913
I'm happy to finally play here
in the fine city of Miami.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.193
Minnesota.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.797
Whatever. Shit.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.876
Soon it was commonplace for entire teams
to change in search of greater profits.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.397
The Minneapolis Lakers moved to
Los Angeles, where there are no lakes.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.155
The Oilers moved to Tennessee,
where there's no oil.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.313
The Jazz moved to Salt Lake City
where they don't allow music.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.110
The Oakland Raiders moved to L.A.
And then back to Oakland.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.476
No one in L.A. Seemed to notice.

03:45.880 --> 03:50.908
The search for greener pastures went on.
Continued expansion diluted

03:51.320 --> 03:53.550
the talent pool, forcing owners

03:53.960 --> 03:56.599
to recruit heavily from prisons,
mental institutions and Texas.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.912
Fistfighting and brawling

04:00.320 --> 04:05.269
overshadowed every athletic competition.
As the problems mounted,

04:05.680 --> 04:09.958
the fans became less and less interested.
To reverse the trend,

04:10.360 --> 04:16.310
major sports started interleague play.
Then they tried intersports play.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.669
But no matter how far major sports went,
it wasn't enough

04:23.080 --> 04:24.479
to bring the fans back.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.237
The spirit of athletic competition, though,
indeed was not dead.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.792
Its seed merely lay dormant
in the dreams of the young.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.954
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna be a big sports star.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.352
You know, Remer, someday
I'm gonna own a big sports bar.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.919
Hurry up, Coop.
- I just gotta water the plants.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.430
I don't wanna be with high school losers.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.877
This is Brittany Kaiser's house,
and I really wanna fuck her.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.233
Dr. Kaiser!

05:03.640 --> 05:04.993
Coop and Remer.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.871
We graduated with Brittany.
- You graduated?

05:10.640 --> 05:13.108
Of course we did, cock. Beer?

05:16.240 --> 05:20.233
This place looks like
a "Dockers" commercial. Hey, Stef!

05:20.640 --> 05:22.471
Coop! Remer!

05:22.960 --> 05:23.949
Want a beer?

05:24.360 --> 05:28.069
Oh, my God! You haven't changed at all.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.515
Cool!

05:29.920 --> 05:31.035
No, it isn't.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.273
Cock!

05:36.800 --> 05:39.678
Hey, Skid Mark Steve!
You still hanging out

05:40.080 --> 05:43.550
and playing Nintendo?
- I'm in my 2nd year of med school

05:43.960 --> 05:46.713
and training for the Summer Games.
What're you two up to?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.431
Hanging out, playing Nintendo. Cock.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.314
Hi, Brittany!

06:00.880 --> 06:02.757
Didn't think you guys would show up.

06:03.160 --> 06:07.517
We wouldn't miss it. - I don't remember
putting you on the guest list.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.876
Ted told us about it.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.199
Excuse me!

06:13.600 --> 06:16.831
Why did you tell those losers? - Me...

06:17.240 --> 06:21.028
Let's bail. - No, let's go to Brittany's room!

06:24.320 --> 06:26.993
Come in here! Check it out.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.118
Brittany's underwear. - Aw, dude!

06:35.920 --> 06:37.239
Dude!

06:38.520 --> 06:40.511
I am so jealous of you.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.474
Excuse me! - Brittany!

06:48.000 --> 06:50.560
What're you doing in my mom's room?

06:56.280 --> 06:57.269
Get outta here!

07:00.560 --> 07:01.629
Oh, Jesus!

07:06.000 --> 07:09.470
We'll never get her. - Or any chick.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.953
We have no jobs, the rent's overdue

07:14.360 --> 07:16.396
and our gas is about to get shut off.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.677
What do girls want anyway?

07:20.720 --> 07:25.111
Apparently, not total losers.
- We're pretty good at basketball.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.279
As long as we don't have to run
or jump or dribble.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.672
That shit's overrated anyway.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.392
You guys up for a little game?
- Sure.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.118
Let's make it interesting.

07:39.520 --> 07:43.798
20 bucks? - How about 50? - You're on.

07:45.720 --> 07:51.716
Haven't got 50 bucks. - They're no good.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.193
Oh, shit!

08:01.480 --> 08:03.914
We playing or not?

08:04.320 --> 08:08.313
But not that pussy ass two-on-two
you guys play in the suburbs.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.634
You guys got something better?
- This new game we picked up in the hood.

08:15.040 --> 08:15.870
What is it?

08:16.680 --> 08:20.878
Okay.
I shoot from wherever I want, right?

08:21.280 --> 08:24.078
Then you have to make the same shot,
or else you get a letter.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.034
You mean like "horse"?
- It's not like "horse".

08:31.520 --> 08:35.910
Duh. It's uh...
baseball rules.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.794
A single's
from the freethrow line.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.113
A double's from the top of the key.
- You have to shoot from a different place.

08:44.520 --> 08:48.069
A triple's from back here, and a home run's
from behind the meatballs.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.278
You miss, you get an out.
Ready? Break. - What?

08:52.360 --> 08:55.238
We can explain it more slowly,
big sports guys!

08:57.840 --> 09:00.115
No, we get it.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.033
Losers up first.
- This is a single, right?

09:06.440 --> 09:10.433
And a homerun's behind the meatballs.
- Take your shot, guy!

09:13.480 --> 09:18.076
You can't spit beer at me! - I can do
what I want to make you miss your shot!

09:18.480 --> 09:23.634
He's right. That's one out.
- One out? Give me the damn ball!

09:26.600 --> 09:27.874
I fucked your sister.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.990
Coop lines up for a double.
Okay, guys, 2nd and 3rd.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.151
Runner on 3rd. This could bring him home.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.993
Yeah, two outs!

09:45.400 --> 09:46.628
Come on!

09:52.600 --> 09:56.718
Tip-in! Double play, three outs!
- What? - We're up.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.509
That's nice!
- This could almost seal it.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.748
Made that look easy!

10:10.760 --> 10:13.320
One of Brittany's mom's pubic hairs!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.035
Oh, God!

10:15.920 --> 10:20.789
Man! - Dude, we win the game! A sweet
psyche-out. - Here's another one!

10:22.160 --> 10:24.196
We win and they get

10:24.600 --> 10:29.151
the chicks. That sucks, dude.
- We gotta get jobs.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.994
Then we get the khakis.
Then the chicks.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.914
Starting tomorrow
we gotta stop playing games!

10:36.560 --> 10:38.755
Miss it. Steve Perry...

10:41.920 --> 10:46.436
Yes! Three outs. I'm up.
- Bottom of the 5th. - Joseph R. Cooper?

10:47.520 --> 10:50.353
Single! Man on 1st.
- Are you Joe Cooper?

10:50.760 --> 10:52.193
Cut the crap, Squeak. You know me.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.751
This authorizes me to enter
your property and terminate services

10:56.160 --> 10:58.515
until all delinquent payments
have been generated. - What?

10:58.920 --> 11:02.674
He's here to shut off the gas.
- You work for the gas company?

11:04.160 --> 11:06.754
Gentlemen...
- Double! Guy on 2nd and 3rd.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.231
Is your canine locked up
or secured within your domicile?

11:11.640 --> 11:15.918
He's getting his claws removed.
- If you'll excuse me.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.835
Does it just suck being you?
- I'll show those guys

11:20.240 --> 11:22.117
what sucks.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.389
Oh yeah, he misses...
- Damn it!

11:35.800 --> 11:39.509
...I'm running outta ideas.
- That's why we have this short shot.

11:39.920 --> 11:43.549
Kind of like a bunt. - Exactly!
Doesn't put any runners on base. - Sweet!

11:43.960 --> 11:46.110
You lied to me! Again!

11:46.520 --> 11:50.991
Right. The dog's appointment is tomorrow.
- Honest mistake, Squeak.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.391
My name's not Squeak. It's Kenny!

11:53.800 --> 11:56.678
Alright, you little bitch.
Take a shot!

11:58.440 --> 12:02.956
No, I wanna turn off your gas.
And don't call me bitch!

12:03.360 --> 12:05.157
Okay, Squeak, let's just shoot for it.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.633
What? Are you insane?
This is my job, you assholes!

12:10.040 --> 12:12.873
All you gotta do
is make a single from here,

12:13.280 --> 12:16.556
and you can shut off our gas, and
we'll never call you Squeak again.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.154
Or bitch.

12:18.880 --> 12:19.869
Or bitch.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.559
From here?

12:27.760 --> 12:29.955
Alright. Check this shit out!

12:34.920 --> 12:37.753
Tough break, Squeak.
Now you gotta fetch the ball, bitch.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.190
Three months later

12:44.720 --> 12:47.359
We can win the game with this one.
Bring me home.

12:48.760 --> 12:51.194
We win the game!

12:53.800 --> 12:55.438
We got 5 runs that inning.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.432
This game's pretty badass.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.751
You're up.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.519
Tyler, I hear your sister's going out
with Squeak.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.391
Another psych-out.
- I'm not going out with his sister.

13:08.800 --> 13:13.191
That's the defense. - We gotta say
fucked-up shit to make 'em miss.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.272
Oh, right.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.478
Wait a minute! Why is me going out
with his sister fucked up?

13:18.880 --> 13:21.314
Pierce, I hear
your mom's going out with Squeak.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.795
Two outs!

13:24.840 --> 13:28.037
You're gonna own 1/12 of the rent,
the water bill, the power bill,

13:28.440 --> 13:31.034
the cable bill...
- Check it out! - What's that?

13:31.440 --> 13:32.634
A baseketball!

13:33.040 --> 13:35.270
You made a ball? Out of what?

13:40.440 --> 13:44.274
I can't believe you were fired for
not shutting off our gas for 6 weeks!

13:44.680 --> 13:46.875
Losing the truck pissed 'em off the most.

13:47.280 --> 13:51.159
You can camp out here for a while.
- This is pretty sweet!

13:51.520 --> 13:55.399
Does it fold out? - Yeah, a great bed!
But that's Jenkins' bed.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.756
Your bed's over there.

13:58.160 --> 14:03.075
Dude, that is so fucking weak. How am I
supposed to get a chick in that?

14:03.480 --> 14:07.155
You couldn't get a chick if you had
$100 hanging outta your zipper.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.835
Yeah, I could!
- No, you're a little bitch.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.152
I am not!
Why am I hanging out with you guys?

14:13.560 --> 14:16.438
'Cause you're a piece of shit.
- I am not.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.398
But you're a little bitch.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.794
Goddam it! You rip on me 13 or
14 more times and I'm outta here.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.317
Whatever! I gotta show you
the scoreboard I made!

14:28.840 --> 14:31.070
Your place is a shit-hole anyway.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.757
At least I'm on the team.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.596
Yeah, they want me...

14:43.160 --> 14:44.912
Six months later

14:45.320 --> 14:50.553
An new driveway game has captured
the imagination of a neighborhood.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.916
...enjoying themselves
at the final game.

14:53.320 --> 14:57.438
An entire league has sprung up.
- Starting with 12 teams in June.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.630
Now down to just two,
including the inventors of the game.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.919
It's off the rim.
Could be a double play, Maxwell tips...

15:10.520 --> 15:11.748
Newman's try...

15:12.600 --> 15:13.589
No!

15:14.680 --> 15:17.240
Shirts have a shot at the conversion.

15:17.640 --> 15:19.358
Remer...

15:23.040 --> 15:27.033
Keeps it alive.
Last chance! Coop...

15:29.040 --> 15:32.316
They make the conversion!
The home run counts!

15:40.960 --> 15:44.714
What a game! The Shirts win
the World Championship

15:45.120 --> 15:46.997
of Baseketball.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.029
Gentlemen!

15:53.240 --> 15:55.356
Gentlemen, I'm Ted Denslow.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.756
The billionaire?
- Yes.

15:58.640 --> 16:01.074
Anyway, I like your little game.
How'd you like to go pro?

16:02.040 --> 16:06.511
Baseketball? - I got 3 words for you:
National Baseketball League.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.028
We're not interested.
- Wait a minute! Hear me out.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.273
You kids with your loud music
and your Dan Fogelberg,

16:13.680 --> 16:16.717
your Zima, hula hoops
and Pac-Man video games.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.439
Don't you see?

16:18.840 --> 16:23.868
People's attention spans today can
only be measured in nanoseconds.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.151
I hear you.
- Just look at these people!

16:32.720 --> 16:36.156
They feel a certain connection with you
as players.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.837
With baseketball
we can start fresh,

16:40.240 --> 16:42.674
not allow teams
to change cities,

16:43.480 --> 16:47.234
or players to be traded.
And everybody will get paid the same,

16:47.640 --> 16:50.598
like when I was a kid
and players were treated like...

16:51.000 --> 16:52.911
Indentured servants?
- Yes!

16:53.320 --> 16:57.757
The real beauty of this game is
anyone can play.

16:58.160 --> 17:03.154
Any normal Joe can be a sports hero.
Never wanted to be a sports hero?

17:04.560 --> 17:08.030
Sure, once.
But that was long time ago.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.479
If I know anything about this country,
it will go nuts for baseketball.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.032
America will go crazy.

17:18.359 --> 17:21.432
Listen to that crowd!

17:35.480 --> 17:39.519
Five years later

18:04.160 --> 18:07.470
9th inning. The Beers still behind by
3 runs and down to their last out.

18:07.880 --> 18:10.713
The pressure on these players
has to be enormous.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.315
Alright, guys, we've got one out left.

18:13.720 --> 18:18.077
We can still win this thing.
Can we do it? - Yes!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.352
What a game these fans are seeing!

18:22.760 --> 18:27.436
That gentleman is Ted Denslow,
the father of professional baseketball,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.514
along with his lovely new wife
Yvette.

18:31.960 --> 18:37.592
Now shooting, number 44,
Coop "Airman" Cooper!

18:41.200 --> 18:43.350
Coop is heading for the triple square.

18:43.760 --> 18:47.514
Bob Costas, this has to be one
of the most exciting baseketball games.

18:47.920 --> 18:51.515
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago
this game was played only on driveways.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.070
Hard to believe that just 5 years ago

18:54.480 --> 18:57.358
those girls were
only in grade school.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.076
Coop at the triple line, and Jansen
sets up for the psych-out.

19:04.280 --> 19:05.156
Be right with you!

19:08.080 --> 19:11.356
It's good!
- Coop triples again.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.228
He's hit for the cycle
already 7 times tonight.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.635
Listen to those foam heads
doing the Beers' chug!

19:29.080 --> 19:32.868
Coop's on third, with two down.
That brings up Squeak Scolari.

19:33.280 --> 19:37.512
I knew it was gonna come down to me.
- It's not just you. We're a team.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.911
It all comes down to just one man.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.630
Oh, God! - If I could have
one guy out there, it'd be you.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.474
Unfortunately,
that one man is Squeak Scolari.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.235
Shit!
- Pretend this is just another game.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.949
The Denslow Cup is
the biggest game of the season

19:52.360 --> 19:56.751
Christ! - Will you turn that shit off?
- I'm scared! - Listen to me.

19:57.160 --> 20:01.278
You make that shot, or I'm gonna shove
your head so far up your fucking ass...

20:01.680 --> 20:06.037
Doug Remer giving his teammate
some last minute encouragement.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.436
Go out there and make that shot!

20:19.000 --> 20:23.073
The talented Felon girls
appearing in their 3rd Denslow Cup game.

20:24.240 --> 20:29.189
Now shooting, number 23,
Squeak "Little Bitch" Scolari!

20:33.840 --> 20:37.037
Squeak Scolari walks out
to take the last remaining single.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.715
Come on, bitch!

20:40.880 --> 20:42.677
Hey, Squeak! Miss it!

20:44.960 --> 20:47.838
It's good!
The Beers stay alive in the 9th.

20:50.240 --> 20:54.631
Dallas Felons' owner, Baxter Cain
hoping for another Denslow Cup victory.

20:55.040 --> 20:59.272
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

21:01.440 --> 21:04.273
Remer heads for the double line.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.435
Remer, you better make sure
your toe's not over the line.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.072
Hey, Jansen, nice psych-out,
dingleberry. Yes!

21:13.160 --> 21:16.197
It's now a 2-run game.
Dirk Jansen apparently missed

21:16.600 --> 21:18.192
another psych-out.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.353
Everyone at Beers Garden
is on their feet!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.274
At a time like this

21:25.680 --> 21:27.716
you can't help thinking about guys
like John Elway,

21:28.120 --> 21:31.032
guys who kept coming close
and then finally got there.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.551
If Coop can make this one,
the Beers' long wait will be over.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.991
Hey, Coop, looks like
your boy Denslow's gonna buy the farm.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.434
He missed.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.959
The Felons win their
2nd consecutive Denslow Cup

21:50.360 --> 21:52.510
on the strength
of a Dirk Jansen psych-out.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.751
I got you, dude. I got you!

21:56.040 --> 21:57.996
Relax. Do the Happy Dance!

21:58.400 --> 22:01.233
We just lost the game!
- Do the Happy Dance!

22:02.320 --> 22:05.437
Where's the singing?
- I don't wanna sing! - Come on, sing!

22:10.600 --> 22:13.910
Shit, Denslow! - These Beers fans
have to be disappointed.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.594
What an unfortunate thing
to happen on "Dozen Egg Night".

22:22.960 --> 22:25.679
It's my husband!
Somebody help him! Oh, God!

22:26.080 --> 22:30.153
If there's anything you need.
- Oh, Teddy! He just fell over!

22:35.680 --> 22:37.557
I wish there was something I could do.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.318
They stopped serving them after the 7th.
Get this man a hot dog!

22:47.920 --> 22:50.388
You're absolutely right, Jim.
Ted Denslow was a hero,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.997
because his vision brought baseketball
from local driveways into big arenas,

22:54.400 --> 22:57.437
but more importantly,
into the hearts and TVs of America.

22:57.840 --> 23:01.594
His untimely death casts a pall
over an otherwise sweet victory!

23:02.000 --> 23:03.319
And all of our hearts...

23:05.720 --> 23:08.518
Dirk Jansen, winner of

23:08.920 --> 23:11.593
the "Winter's Warm Douche" M.V.P. Trophy.
What's your take?

23:12.000 --> 23:16.357
The key to the game
was when I psyched out Coop.

23:17.280 --> 23:21.558
He didn't psyche me out! If anyone got
the psych-out, it should be Denslow.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.110
Dude, weak.

23:24.520 --> 23:28.832
I know this is a dark time for you, but I'd like
your thoughts on what happened tonight.

23:29.240 --> 23:33.392
I lost the big game
and a dear friend.

23:33.800 --> 23:39.557
I'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now.
I don't think I should be alone...

23:39.960 --> 23:43.509
It does seem to be raining shit
on Joe Cooper right now.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.634
On paper,
the Beers had the far superior team.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.838
But the outside shooting of Coop
and the deadly accuracy of Doug Remer.

23:50.240 --> 23:52.800
What happened out there?
- Well, you know...

23:53.200 --> 23:56.909
It was a team effort. It took every player
working together to lose this one.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.995
Thanks, Doug. And so...
- You wanna do an interview with me?

24:01.400 --> 24:05.029
No! So another baseketball championship
is in the books.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.079
Yet another opportunity lost
for the Beers.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.436
I gotta go.

24:14.040 --> 24:18.192
What's going on? Coop?
- This was Tim McCarver

24:18.600 --> 24:22.912
from Beers Garden, where the Felons
have defeated the Milwaukee Beers.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.390
In Denslow Cup IV...

24:27.480 --> 24:31.359
Everybody in.
One at a time.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.909
There he is!

24:37.320 --> 24:41.029
Coop! - Oh, man!
- Can we talk to him?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.275
Excuse me.

24:47.680 --> 24:50.069
Would you mind
signing autographs for the kids?

24:50.480 --> 24:54.439
The Dallas locker room's over there.
- I know, but it was so crowded.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.388
They'd really rather have
your autograph.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.110
Really?
- Would you mind signing these?

25:03.000 --> 25:04.069
Sure.

25:08.760 --> 25:11.399
It's nice to meet you, Miss...?
- Reed. Jenna Reed.

25:11.800 --> 25:14.598
Joe Cooper, Coop.
- I know.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.753
Are all these kids with you?

25:17.160 --> 25:20.630
I've been the director of the "Dream
Come True Foundation" since October.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.235
The one that grants wishes
to sick and dying kids, right?

25:23.640 --> 25:26.837
We prefer to think of them as
health- and survival-impaired.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.475
You're a big fan of baseketball?
- No.

25:31.320 --> 25:35.950
I mean, the kids are! I try to keep
them interested in permanent things.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.032
Permanent?

25:38.440 --> 25:43.070
Professional athletes come and go.
- Not in baseketball. There's rules against it.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.674
Hello!

25:45.920 --> 25:48.718
Miss Reed, this is Remer.
- Like a fresh pretzel?

25:50.480 --> 25:51.674
I baked it myself.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.396
Oh, thank you.
- Goes great with mustard.

25:56.440 --> 25:57.953
Miss Reed?

25:58.360 --> 26:00.351
You didn't make that, did you?
- No!

26:00.760 --> 26:04.389
But chicks like guys who can cook.
- What?

26:04.800 --> 26:09.157
See! She was checking out my ass.
- She wasn't!

26:09.560 --> 26:12.199
I'd better get these kids back.
Little Travis is getting impatient.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.718
I love kids. Which one is Travis?
Heads up, big guy.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.435
Needs a little work on the hands.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.914
He's blind, Doug.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.234
Felons' fans

26:29.640 --> 26:33.792
rejoiced in their Denslow Cup victory
in downtown Dallas.

26:34.200 --> 26:37.351
Final tally: 14 injured, 3 dead.

26:38.240 --> 26:42.870
The sports world was devastated
by the passing of Ted Denslow.

26:43.280 --> 26:47.671
The late Beers owner seemed to be
the only one surprised by his death.

26:48.080 --> 26:52.232
Time just finally ran out
for the old cocksucker.

26:52.640 --> 26:58.112
Theodore Denslow dead at 85.
His hairpiece was 24.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.508
These chaps

27:01.920 --> 27:05.833
I wore in "Rootin' Tootin' Rhythm"
I bequeath to my nephew Herman.

27:06.240 --> 27:09.073
Hope he looks
as snappy in them as I did.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.597
And this poncho
that kept me dry...

27:13.400 --> 27:17.109
Mrs. Denslow? Baxter Cain. May I?
- Of course.

27:17.520 --> 27:21.354
My deepest sympathy!
- Thank you, Mr. Cain.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.149
This hand-painted plate commemorating

27:24.560 --> 27:26.118
the Pope's visit to Dodger Stadium

27:26.520 --> 27:31.469
I leave to my niece Susan.
Limited edition, signed

27:31.880 --> 27:36.112
with a photocopied certificate
of authenticity... - Jenna!

27:37.560 --> 27:40.279
What are you doing here?
- I'm not sure.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.989
I got this letter...
- Me, too.

27:44.040 --> 27:45.871
And the toothbrush...

27:50.040 --> 27:52.873
Where's the body?
- They buried him 2 days ago.

27:53.280 --> 27:56.431
This is the will reading.
- Well, in that case...

27:58.160 --> 28:00.196
These are for you, Jenna.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.672
I bequeath these season tickets

28:03.320 --> 28:06.835
to the "Dream Come True Foundation".

28:07.240 --> 28:10.789
I had nothing but respect
for your late husband.

28:11.200 --> 28:16.274
Unfortunately, he stood in the way
of making changes in baseketball

28:16.680 --> 28:19.797
that might increase the owners' profits.

28:20.200 --> 28:23.192
I can't imagine
what he had against making money?

28:24.200 --> 28:28.432
I trust that quality
isn't sexually transmitted.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.748
Pretty sweet, huh?

28:32.440 --> 28:36.558
Yeah, the kids will be excited.
Especially little Joey.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.157
Joey?
- He's such a big fan of yours.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.075
He's going into the hospital next week,

28:43.480 --> 28:46.677
and begged me to ask you to visit him,
but it's not a good idea.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.470
I'd love to come by.
- I'll come by. I like hospitals.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.359
You like Taco Bell.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.149
I went to this hospital in France
and got together with this chick.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.788
Dude, that was a hostel!

28:58.200 --> 29:00.919
Finally, my beloved Beers,
I bequeath

29:01.320 --> 29:02.753
controlling interest

29:04.080 --> 29:06.150
to Joseph R. Cooper.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.032
We own the team!

29:10.440 --> 29:13.910
I gave him
the best 3 months of my life.

29:16.640 --> 29:17.755
Way to go, dude!

29:18.160 --> 29:19.036
And, Coop?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.510
Yes, Mr. Denslow?

29:22.360 --> 29:26.069
I know you have it in you to lead the Beers
to victory this season.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.916
Because if you don't
the team reverts to Yvette.

29:31.600 --> 29:36.754
Don't feel badly about losing the team.
I believe this is merely temporary.

29:37.560 --> 29:39.232
Thank you, Mr. Cain.

29:39.640 --> 29:44.475
It's nice to have a strong, handsome man
like you on my side.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.316
Well, I'd love to discuss this
further with you.

29:48.720 --> 29:53.271
Why don't you visit sometime?
Maybe we could

29:54.280 --> 29:58.159
lay some carpet,
if you know what I mean.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.393
At this time, I'd like to ask
everyone to leave the room,

30:01.800 --> 30:04.792
so I can have
a private moment with Coop.

30:08.320 --> 30:11.118
Now that we're alone, Coop,
there's something I wanna tell you.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.273
Remember
when you had the crabs

30:14.680 --> 30:18.719
and this lotion made you feel better?
I've found another use for it.

30:19.400 --> 30:23.871
It's so good, it makes me wanna sing.
Just like the night

30:24.280 --> 30:27.158
we spent in the tattoo parlor in Chicago.
Come on, baby!

30:42.440 --> 30:44.032
You getting this?

30:54.760 --> 30:59.595
That's two rooms done.
Those corners are tricky! - A fine job!

31:02.080 --> 31:07.712
I've come up with a plan to make sure
Coop never wins the Denslow Cup.

31:08.120 --> 31:13.638
So the team will be mine?
- Yes. - Wonderful, Baxter.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.793
Do you want me to move on
to the conference room? - Not yet.

31:17.200 --> 31:21.796
But I think my lobby
could use a good buffing.

31:22.200 --> 31:27.194
If you know what I mean.
- I know exactly what you mean.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.554
I can't do this shit!

31:34.760 --> 31:38.912
The Beers coming up to bat
in this season opener against Miami,

31:39.320 --> 31:42.312
a game
they have dedicated to Ted Denslow,

31:42.720 --> 31:47.032
the team wearing black in memory
of the late Beers owner.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.637
The Beers cheerleaders
also mourning the loss.

32:10.360 --> 32:14.751
Dude, it's a whole different ball game
now that you own the team.

32:15.160 --> 32:19.358
Denslow was right.
This season could be different.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.309
We just gotta kick some ass
and play to keep this team. You ready?

32:23.720 --> 32:25.756
I'm in, all or nothing.

32:32.240 --> 32:36.711
Joining us this evening, big fan
of baseketball, Tony Nocciolino,

32:37.120 --> 32:41.318
who plays Latino cutup Scooter
on the comedy series "What's the Difference?",

32:41.720 --> 32:44.712
airing between "Recycled Junk",
starring Lisa Campbell,

32:45.120 --> 32:48.032
and "Same Old Crap",
featuring teen heartthrob Mark Swenson.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.229
All part of the great fall line-up
on "Who Gives a Rat's Ass" Thursdays.

32:52.640 --> 32:56.269
Great to have you with us.
- So Miami takes the field.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.318
We're underway.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.236
Coop steps into
the single square.

33:07.480 --> 33:10.278
It's good! - The Beers are off
to a promising start tonight!

33:11.920 --> 33:13.911
This game is made all the more special

33:14.320 --> 33:17.869
by the fact
it's "Free Range Chicken Night".

33:18.280 --> 33:20.555
The Beers up by two,
but the Dealers are only one out.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.554
That brings up Enrique Hernandez.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.115
Hernandez, look!

33:31.880 --> 33:34.394
Fat from Marlon Brando's ass.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.829
Uh, no! What am I doing here?

33:40.520 --> 33:43.910
It's all salty and warm.
Why would I do this?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.912
This guy ate a lot of pork!

33:50.880 --> 33:51.915
Damn it!

33:52.320 --> 33:57.235
It was a killer psych-out. - Really?
- Shake it off. I got this guy.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.272
Got milk?

34:07.800 --> 34:11.110
Coop tips, and it's good!
Double play. Beers win.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.235
Remer still nailing down that psych-out.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.956
We totally kicked ass.
- And this is just the start.

34:26.360 --> 34:30.069
Could you sign my chicken?
- Joe Cooper? Baxter Cain.

34:30.480 --> 34:34.951
Denslow told me about you.
- Welcome to our community of owners.

34:35.360 --> 34:38.909
If there's anything you need,
don't hesitate to ask. - Thanks, dude.

34:39.320 --> 34:42.995
We're going to be voting next week
on some changes in baseketball's rules.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.915
I want to tell everyone you're with us.
- Why it's fine the way it is.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.791
Until we allow teams to move cities
and players to change teams

34:52.199 --> 34:54.509
and take advantage
of lucrative corporate tie-ins,

34:54.920 --> 34:58.913
you and your colleagues are going
to have to continue working for...

35:02.080 --> 35:03.069
Chicken poo?

35:04.680 --> 35:07.399
Feed. Chicken feed.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.948
Coop, the ball is in your court.
For those rules to change,

35:12.360 --> 35:15.955
every owner has to vote yes.
Denslow was already filthy rich.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.800
He didn't need the changes.
But you do.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.830
You're asking me to go against
every reason we created this game.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.117
Before you make
any hasty decisions,

35:26.520 --> 35:30.752
discuss it with your teammate.
- I don't have to. We think alike.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.195
Sorry, but if you want unanimous consent,
get it from one of the other owners.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.399
Are we gonna kick their ass?

35:49.080 --> 35:51.674
We're gonna take these mooks out or what?
- Let me handle this one!

35:52.080 --> 35:55.117
In the river, baby!
- Come on! - No doubt about it!

35:56.720 --> 35:59.792
Your mother's
a terrible cook!

36:06.600 --> 36:08.795
I'm gonna kick your ass.
- Easy.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.030
Can't gross me out.
- Well, check out Coop!

36:45.560 --> 36:46.959
I wanna feel you.

36:48.600 --> 36:49.749
Deep inside me.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.870
That's not fair!

36:56.480 --> 36:58.311
Come on, Zane. That was...

36:59.520 --> 37:01.192
That was fair. Let's play ball.

37:01.600 --> 37:04.319
Hey, Watson,
have you seen those beer commercials?

37:05.200 --> 37:07.509
How to speak San Franciscan.

37:08.720 --> 37:09.709
"Vajoina"!

37:13.320 --> 37:17.233
That wasn't a gay joke.
That was an Australian joke.

37:18.920 --> 37:21.718
"Beers Still Winning
More and More Games"

37:31.320 --> 37:33.788
Come on, let's do it!
- What do we always say?

37:34.200 --> 37:37.078
One, two, three,
fuck the Mexicans!

37:42.240 --> 37:46.074
I'll take my shot! Sure hope I make it,
so I can get home quick

37:46.480 --> 37:49.392
and smack my wife in the eye.
- Shut up, Remer.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.791
Shut your mouth!

37:54.400 --> 37:56.550
Take that!

37:57.080 --> 37:58.069
Aw shit!

38:19.720 --> 38:21.676
My eye!

38:30.960 --> 38:32.951
"If a woman wants a mate to respond,

38:33.280 --> 38:35.840
she will reveal to him the secret
of a woman's duality.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.993
She will tell him
about the interior woman,

38:39.400 --> 38:42.073
that one who added to herself
makes two. "

38:43.480 --> 38:45.994
I didn't expect you'd come.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.595
I thought I'd say hi to little friend Joey.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.798
He's sleeping, and
I really wanted to finish this book.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.589
Well, maybe
it'll make him feel better. Joey!

38:58.080 --> 39:02.198
Look who's here.
- My biological father?

39:03.280 --> 39:04.713
No, Joe Cooper.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.555
Is it really you?
- Yeah, it's me.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.394
Your psych-outs
were the best.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.199
Thanks, dude.

39:13.600 --> 39:14.953
What's a "vajoina"?

39:16.240 --> 39:18.595
What seems to be the problem, guy?

39:19.720 --> 39:21.551
I'm going to die.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.032
We're all gonna die.
- Yeah, but not this week.

39:26.240 --> 39:31.314
What about staying positive?
Your donor liver's arriving today.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.039
Look what I brought you.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.437
Wow, A LA-Z-BOY!
- Yeah, I made it myself.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.354
If I had a nickel for every time
this ball pulled me out,

39:40.760 --> 39:42.352
I'd have a shitload of nickels.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.434
I wanna be just like you
when I grow up.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.751
Here's your decaf mocha, Jenna.

39:50.160 --> 39:54.233
Just like you take it: Non-fat milk, low-whipped
cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.393
Thank you, Doug.
- I baked you fresh poppyseed muffins, too.

40:01.240 --> 40:05.995
Poppyseed muffins! I thought you had
your electrolysis appointment today.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.038
I did. Here.

40:11.680 --> 40:12.999
Listen, partner.

40:13.880 --> 40:19.000
I talked to the foundation.
They want to make your last wish...

40:19.840 --> 40:23.116
They want to make your dream come true
as long as it doesn't

40:23.520 --> 40:25.511
involve a miracle cure or something.

40:25.920 --> 40:28.798
The guys on death row
only get a meal, right?

40:30.400 --> 40:31.913
So, what's your dream?

40:32.320 --> 40:35.198
I've always dreamed
of big-game hunting,

40:35.600 --> 40:38.433
killing an endangered species,
like a bald eagle

40:38.840 --> 40:42.799
or a giant panda. - That's not
in the spirit of the foundation.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.997
How about poisoning the reservoir?

40:45.400 --> 40:49.234
Or throwing flesh-eating fish
into a public swimming pool?

40:49.640 --> 40:51.710
I don't think you're getting the point.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.439
Come on, Joey.

40:53.840 --> 40:58.550
Search your heart. What's the one thing
you want more than anything else?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.479
Chelsea Clinton?

41:03.440 --> 41:06.512
That's a pretty tall order.
- You'd have a better shot at Bill.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.956
Any backup dreams?

41:10.360 --> 41:11.634
There is one other thing.

41:12.680 --> 41:15.035
Could I just once
hang out with the team?

41:15.440 --> 41:18.318
Just spend a day with the Beers?
Could I, Coop?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.592
I don't know...
- And Miss Reed, too.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.758
This has been so fun. I feel like
I'm gonna puke all over the bar.

42:44.800 --> 42:45.949
Look, Jerry Springer!

42:47.160 --> 42:51.438
Here is your daughter-in-law...
- She's my son's wife.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.749
Nicole! Let's say hi to Nicole.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.516
We'll drink every time
a fight breaks out.

43:03.960 --> 43:05.188
Fight!

43:12.160 --> 43:13.718
Fight!

43:22.440 --> 43:24.795
You see, Joey,
dreams really do come true.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.470
You're the best, Coop!

43:42.600 --> 43:46.878
Man, it's late. We've got a game tonight
and you've got that big liver operation.

43:47.920 --> 43:48.909
Yeah, but...

43:49.320 --> 43:51.515
What, dude?
You're gonna be fine.

43:51.920 --> 43:54.275
I know I could pull through, if...

43:54.920 --> 43:57.388
If what, dude?
- Just say it and Coop will do it.

43:58.600 --> 44:02.912
Do you think you could hit
a home run for me tonight? - Well...

44:03.320 --> 44:06.118
It's not like he's asking you
to hit 2 home runs!

44:06.520 --> 44:09.876
Can you hit 2 homeruns?
- Of course.

44:10.280 --> 44:14.876
This is Coop Cooper. He could hit
3 home runs if you wanted. Huh, Coop?

44:15.640 --> 44:20.634
3? Alright. - Remer, can I talk to you
over there real quick?

44:22.520 --> 44:25.830
You know, Joey, I've hit my fair share
of homeruns, too.

44:26.240 --> 44:30.950
Nice, but Coop's gonna hit 3 home runs
for me. - Great, Joey.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.318
Coop's the greatest guy
in the whole world!

44:34.720 --> 44:36.039
Yeah, he's a major dude.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.112
I feel much better now.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.756
Mr. Squeak? - What?
- What grade are you in?

44:44.640 --> 44:46.119
Anybody call a taxi?

44:46.520 --> 44:49.990
I called a taxi! - We gotta get going
if I'm gonna hit those 3 home runs.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.834
Don't worry.
From now, everything's gonna be A-OK.

44:53.240 --> 44:56.471
This is the best day
of my entire life.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.399
What a story this is!

45:00.800 --> 45:05.351
Little Joey Thomas undergoing
a lifesaving operation tonight.

45:06.480 --> 45:11.918
The fans here all wearing yellow ribbons
in support of this brave little boy.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.756
And his hero, Joe Cooper,
promising to hit 3 home runs,

45:17.160 --> 45:22.871
a promise that could decide between
life and death for this brave boy.

45:23.280 --> 45:26.477
Hey, Pete!
What's the matter with Coop tonight?

45:26.880 --> 45:29.553
I don't know,
but he smells like Christian Slater.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.315
Coop getting ready
to take his shot.

45:34.400 --> 45:37.278
It's good! Coop sinks his 2nd home run.

45:45.640 --> 45:49.394
His blood sugar's way up since yesterday.
Has his fluid intake been changed?

45:49.800 --> 45:51.711
His sodium level's through the roof!

45:52.120 --> 45:56.750
It's strange. He's 8 years old
and smells like Robert Downey, Jr.

45:57.160 --> 45:58.388
9th inning.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.032
Everyone's stomach in knots here,
as Coop steps up. One more chance

46:03.440 --> 46:04.668
for that 3rd home run.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.470
She's here, that girl from the bar.
- That's a guy.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.155
A guy?
- A dude.

46:16.560 --> 46:19.154
You're just saying that,
'cause you want her yourself.

46:19.560 --> 46:24.236
I'm saying that, because she's a guy.
- It's impossible! Just look at her!

46:24.640 --> 46:26.631
The cutest little upturned nose,

46:27.040 --> 46:31.238
the softest lips,
the sweetest Adam's apple...

46:35.360 --> 46:37.794
I can smell her perfume from here.

46:55.880 --> 46:57.472
Coop calls for quiet.

46:57.880 --> 47:00.348
One more chance for that 3rd home run.

47:01.760 --> 47:05.594
He's in deep focus.
This obviously means a lot to him.

47:09.480 --> 47:11.710
He shoots! It's going, going...

47:12.760 --> 47:16.309
Coop has made a dream
come true for that brave little...

47:21.880 --> 47:26.237
Wow! The Lord must really have it in
for that little boy.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.594
Why?

47:33.560 --> 47:35.232
Come on, Coop. It's over.

47:35.640 --> 47:36.675
Poor Joey!

47:37.080 --> 47:40.197
Why? - Sorry, dude.
- If you're looking for Joey Thomas,

47:40.600 --> 47:42.989
he's been moved next door.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.831
Oh, my God!

47:49.240 --> 47:53.358
Why? Why?
- Gentlemen,

47:53.760 --> 47:54.715
in this room!

47:57.960 --> 48:01.111
Joey! I'm here for you, dude!

48:01.520 --> 48:06.071
The operation went fine. Just after
the game, he seemed to be suffocating.

48:06.480 --> 48:11.235
He kept screaming, "Choke!" and lost
consciousness. He'll be fine tomorrow.

48:11.640 --> 48:13.517
Don't stay too long.

48:14.880 --> 48:17.997
Sorry
I missed that 3rd homerun.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.592
Remember I said dreams come true.
Well, they don't.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.550
He's trying to tell you something!

48:26.960 --> 48:28.951
What is it, Joey?

48:29.560 --> 48:32.552
He's turning blue!
- He's freezing. He needs a blanket.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.957
Sir, can I borrow your blanket?
- I'm here for you, Joey.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.318
This should keep you warm.

48:43.400 --> 48:45.914
He's flatlining!
You killed him!

48:46.320 --> 48:50.359
I didn't kill him! - You missed
the 3rd home run, and you killed him.

48:50.920 --> 48:54.196
No! I'm not gonna give up on this kid!
- Calm down, man!

48:54.600 --> 48:55.715
Come on!

48:56.440 --> 48:57.873
Get a hold of yourself!
- Leave me alone!

48:58.680 --> 49:00.511
Live, damn it!

49:00.920 --> 49:05.277
What are you doing? - Where are those
paddle things George Clooney uses?

49:06.400 --> 49:09.233
Give me those things!
- You're gonna kill him! - Clear!

49:12.240 --> 49:14.435
No pulse!
- More power! - 10,000 volts!

49:20.880 --> 49:22.598
15,000!

49:30.080 --> 49:32.753
You know what you're doing?
- What's it look like? - An execution?

49:33.480 --> 49:35.789
I'm trying to save a life.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.192
I'm giving it all I've got, Captain!

49:39.880 --> 49:41.029
I love ya, always have.

49:43.600 --> 49:44.589
Clear!

49:47.080 --> 49:49.150
We gotta try
open heart massage.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.757
Scalpel! Where do I cut?

49:53.400 --> 49:57.916
Code blue, nurse! 70 cc's
of sodium pentothal, stat!

49:59.200 --> 50:00.997
I didn't kill him.
- Get outta here!

50:01.600 --> 50:03.556
Cardiac syringe coming through!

50:18.640 --> 50:22.394
Jackson having an incredible night.

50:22.800 --> 50:26.998
And he's already hit
2 home runs tonight.

50:27.480 --> 50:32.634
You have to wonder what
Charlie Hough is thinking, as Reggie...

50:36.640 --> 50:38.949
...when man and beast
collide.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.476
Death on the back roads
and byways of America!

50:55.880 --> 50:58.269
I can't believe those assholes
taped over the game.

51:08.680 --> 51:11.274
Hi, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

51:11.680 --> 51:14.752
I was just
fixing clam chowder.

51:15.320 --> 51:20.030
Come in. - When you weren't
at the hospital, I came right over.

51:20.440 --> 51:25.195
There was some terrorist attack
on the post-op ward. - Terrorists?

51:25.600 --> 51:31.311
Yeah, they were disguised as baseketball
players. I was so worried...

51:31.720 --> 51:34.871
about Joey.
- Was he...? Is he...?

51:35.280 --> 51:38.511
Oh, he's fine. He came through
the operation with flying colors.

51:38.920 --> 51:42.549
With that new liver he should be peeing
like a champ in no time.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.359
That's kidneys, Coop.

51:47.120 --> 51:48.109
Have a seat.

51:49.040 --> 51:53.875
Thank you for all you've done for Joey.
- Oh, it's nothing.

51:54.280 --> 51:57.955
He's going to remember this day
for the rest of his life.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.153
I don't doubt that.

52:02.520 --> 52:04.590
What a great picture!

52:05.000 --> 52:09.357
Look at you guys. You seem so happy.
- I guess we were.

52:09.760 --> 52:11.591
Best friends playing ball on the driveway.

52:13.160 --> 52:15.913
Next thing I know,
I'm on ESPN and Wheaties boxes.

52:16.320 --> 52:20.996
It's all pretty sweet,
but since Denslow's been gone,

52:21.400 --> 52:24.756
I'm in charge of the team,
and the whole league now.

52:25.160 --> 52:26.991
Sometimes I forget
why I play the game.

52:27.520 --> 52:31.035
Why do you play it, Coop?
- Mr. October.

52:31.320 --> 52:35.154
The guy in the Chippendales calendar?
- No, that was Dwayne Zackemore.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.920
I mean,
whoever it was that month.

52:40.880 --> 52:45.874
I'm talking about Reggie Jackson.
He hit 3 home runs in one game.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.510
I caught the 3rd one
in the stands.

52:48.920 --> 52:52.117
It meant so much to me.
All I ever dreamed of was

52:52.520 --> 52:55.432
to be that guy,
have that one shining moment.

52:56.680 --> 52:59.558
Be a hero.
- You already are a hero, Coop.

53:01.320 --> 53:04.357
You've won
these kids' hearts, but...

53:04.920 --> 53:05.909
What?

53:06.320 --> 53:10.438
I'm just worried about getting attached.
I mean, the kids getting attached.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.389
I don't want them to be hurt.
- Jenna,

53:15.000 --> 53:18.595
I would never do anything to hurt...
these kids.

53:19.800 --> 53:24.828
What Joey really needs to know is:
Where will you be next year?

53:25.840 --> 53:27.239
Right here.

53:27.640 --> 53:30.359
And the next year,
and the year after that.

53:31.840 --> 53:34.638
Until Joey grows up,

53:36.200 --> 53:40.796
and gets his driver's license
and starts going out with girls

53:42.000 --> 53:46.357
and meets the right one and
forgets about baseketball altogether...

53:50.600 --> 53:52.795
...goes home,
does some push-ups,

53:53.200 --> 53:56.795
fucks the sleeve
of his favorite jacket. - What?

53:57.320 --> 54:00.710
I'm just saying, we'll be here
for Joey. I promise.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.112
Oh, Coop,
I want to believe you...

54:05.720 --> 54:08.393
Coop, check out
this cool shit we got at the hospital...

54:08.800 --> 54:10.597
Hey, Jenna.
- Hey, Doug.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.833
You're a little flushed. You have a temperature?
- No, I'm fine.

54:14.240 --> 54:16.674
Open your blouse
and say "Ahh".

54:17.080 --> 54:20.356
I gotta go. - No...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

54:24.400 --> 54:28.075
Thanks a lot, Dr. Dickhead. You totally
fucked me there. - It was a joke.

54:28.480 --> 54:31.358
Give it up! She doesn't like you.
- She has the hots for you?

54:31.760 --> 54:33.398
Squeak has a better chance.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.792
You think?
- That's low. - Why is that low?

54:37.200 --> 54:41.671
Right now you're jealous, but don't
blame me for my sweet ass.

54:44.520 --> 54:47.557
I'm doing the Happy Dance...

54:49.120 --> 54:50.189
Does this thing work?

54:51.560 --> 54:53.391
Can you hear me on this?
- Yeah, check it out.

54:53.800 --> 54:55.199
Asshole!

54:56.760 --> 54:59.797
Wanna get a sandwich?
- Yeah, let's get a sandwich.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.679
Goddam!

55:03.080 --> 55:07.358
Mr. Cain, Doug Remer is here to see you.
- Remer? I asked him to come tomorrow.

55:07.760 --> 55:11.912
Yes, sir, but he's here now
in the trophy room. - The trophy room?

55:15.800 --> 55:17.552
Sweet.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.436
I see you've been admiring
my museum. - Is that really...?

55:42.840 --> 55:45.149
Yes. When I see something I want,
I get it.

55:45.560 --> 55:48.677
Remind me to show you
the prize in the collection:

55:49.080 --> 55:51.719
My autographed Ty Cobb bat.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.151
I'm planning to expand the museum.

55:55.840 --> 55:59.515
Killer set-up, Mr. Cain. What do you pay
in rent? - Nothing. I own it.

55:59.920 --> 56:04.357
Can you break a 20?
- What? Dollars? - I didn't think so!

56:04.760 --> 56:08.435
Let me get straight to the point, Don.
May I call you Don? - Yeah.

56:08.840 --> 56:12.230
When I see one of baseketball's stars
with less than $20 in his pocket,

56:12.640 --> 56:16.155
driving an American car,
sharing a house with 2 other guys,

56:16.560 --> 56:19.711
you know what that says to me?
- Homos?

56:20.120 --> 56:24.113
No! It says you're underappreciated
and underpaid!

56:25.120 --> 56:28.874
Yeah, I guess we are underpaid.
- I want to change all that.

56:29.280 --> 56:33.068
Players of your caliber should be making
the big bucks. Don't you agree?

56:37.720 --> 56:40.075
Try to stay with me, alright?

56:40.480 --> 56:44.951
I tried to get Coop to agree to changes
that would make you millions.

56:45.360 --> 56:47.078
Me? Millions?
- Now listen carefully.

56:47.480 --> 56:50.597
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

56:51.000 --> 56:54.959
Hardly. He did it by moving to L.A.
Know how much he makes now?

56:55.680 --> 57:00.595
As much as at college?
- What? A lot more! Big money.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.434
And you can, too.
- Would I have quit baseketball?

57:03.840 --> 57:06.673
What? No! I need you
to get Coop to go along.

57:07.080 --> 57:08.752
He'd have to quit baseketball, too?

57:13.120 --> 57:14.758
Did I just fart?

57:24.360 --> 57:27.033
Top of the 7th.
Those cheers you're hearing

57:27.440 --> 57:32.434
are from the nearly 15,000 on hand
for "Anal Probe Night".

57:33.120 --> 57:37.671
2 outs. Remer heading for the
triple square. He's 0 for 12 tonight.

57:38.080 --> 57:42.790
With the exception of Coop,
the Beers are ice-cold.

57:43.200 --> 57:46.476
Oh, man! That doesn't even
qualify as an air ball!

57:46.880 --> 57:49.440
The Beers are gone
in the 7th.

57:49.840 --> 57:54.277
The Aliens coming up with the top
of their order, the same 3 guys

57:54.680 --> 57:56.477
who came up last inning.

57:56.880 --> 58:00.156
What the hell's going on?
You guys are lying down out there!

58:00.560 --> 58:02.915
I get it. You guys are pissed off.

58:03.440 --> 58:04.839
Why?

58:06.000 --> 58:09.879
You turned down Cain's offer
without talking to us.

58:13.360 --> 58:16.796
What do you want, dude?
- What do you think?

58:17.200 --> 58:20.317
We invented this game together,
but you get to control everything.

58:20.720 --> 58:23.359
Denslow gave me the team.
I already told Cain no.

58:23.760 --> 58:27.309
Denslow's happy in his worm farm...
- Dude, I'm not gonna do it.

58:27.720 --> 58:30.678
Do you think Shaq got rich
playing in Orlando?

58:31.080 --> 58:34.629
No, in college. Everybody knows that.
It's not about the money.

58:35.480 --> 58:36.708
It's about tradition.

58:37.120 --> 58:39.953
Think about the greats
who have played this game.

58:40.440 --> 58:45.389
It's because of them and us that I can't
bow down to a guy like Cain.

58:45.800 --> 58:50.157
It's easy for you. You got the team.
We got jack shit! Even Squeak's pissed!

58:50.560 --> 58:51.959
I never really minded...
- Shut up, bitch!

58:52.360 --> 58:56.194
Dude, quit thinking about yourself!
- Dude, I'm not gonna cave in!

58:56.600 --> 58:57.794
Dude?

59:05.160 --> 59:09.199
I guess you've got a point there.
Alright, maybe I was wrong.

59:09.600 --> 59:12.637
From now on, we're full partners.
- Really?

59:13.640 --> 59:17.997
You all own part of the team, too.
- Really? You do that for us?

59:18.400 --> 59:20.914
And that's not all:
Prime equity stock options,

59:21.320 --> 59:23.709
comprehensive health care,
full dental, traveling H.M.O.

59:24.120 --> 59:28.193
And 20 weeks of psychiatric care
free of charge. Like it should be.

59:53.600 --> 59:56.114
Hey, Smits!
Wanna see a scary face?

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.912
What?
- Dude...

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.959
"There were four of them in the corral:
The once-proud beast, the broken girl,

01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:16.194
her mother, and, finally, the man
they called The Whisperer.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.871
The woman stared hopefully

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.910
into the ancient cowboy's weathered face.
'Can you help her? '

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.118
'I repair cows, not people. '

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.318
His disjointed voice seemed... "

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:35.829
The Beers win
their 10th consecutive game...

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.071
Who's this bimbo
Coop's got the hots for?

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:41.916
Jenna Reed, the director
of some kids' charity,

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.470
"Dream Come True Foundation. "

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.789
I know 6 men on their board.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.113
Baxter Cain is not going quietly
into the good night. - Baxter?

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:53.839
Who is Ty Cobb?

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.993
Oh, my God!
- Did I just fart?

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.912
9th inning, the Beers are just one out away
from making the play-offs.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.552
They'll have to get by Big Ed Tuttle
and the L.A. Riots.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.433
That's him, Squeak. That's Tuttle.
- He's been talking shit about you.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.310
He told everyone he caught you
jacking off before the game.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.790
He saw that?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.152
You oughta get this guy.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.633
Look at him, man... he's huge!
You want me to psych him out?

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.749
He'll never expect it.
- Here, say this...

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.994
I'm not gonna remember all that!
- This is for the play-offs.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.992
If you get this guy, we're in.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.197
We've got your back.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.988
You mother's deaf. - My mother
is dead, you little twerp!

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.280
So that's why
she didn't move around a lot.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.278
Unbelievable! The Beers win!

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.629
The Beers have done it.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.672
The Beers win a spot in the play-offs
on a psych-out by Squeak Scolari.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.994
He is pissed.

01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:01.719
I didn't go over the line, did I?
- Not at all. - Don't worry!

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.671
Hey, you missed it! We won!
- We kicked ass! We're in the play-offs!

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.514
Yeah, let the tears come.
You're gonna make me start crying.

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.359
This is really emotional.
- Should we just cry?

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.548
We should. We won the game,
got friends, we've got everything!

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.748
Stop that! I'm not crying,
because I'm happy.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.756
Our funding's been cut.
They're gonna close the foundation.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.750
Can they do that?

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:40.076
Poor kids! We can't let this happen.
- We gotta do something.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.235
Sorry. I didn't mean to come here
and ruin your big night...

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.629
Sorry.

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:48.473
Jenna, wait!

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.597
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation with Miss Reed.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.753
What are you doing here?
- I jet here, I jet there.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.957
There's no reason

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.239
for your girlfriend's foundation
to go into Chapter 11...

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.996
I think I may have a solution
to her problem. There!

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.749
A time-tested moneymaker.
Every athlete does it.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.355
You want me to have bigger titties?
- What?

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.988
No!

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.753
It's a clothing line.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:20.513
A Beers clothing line.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.514
That's against the baseketball bylaws.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.151
Not if the proceeds go to charity.
Think about it.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:30.120
Miss Reed's foundation
will never worry about funding again.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.318
Awesome! We should do it!

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.199
Excuse us.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.354
Let me do the talking. No way I'm doing
a deal with this piece of shit.

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:42.433
I thought it was "we".
It's not just up to you anymore.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:46.799
Alright, we can come up
with a better way. - Like how?

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.793
Thought so.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.715
Mr. Cain? As part owner of the Beers,
I'd like to say: Where do I sign?

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.634
Congratulations, Don,
this is gonna change your life.

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:01.555
I look out for my "wimmins".
- Before we discuss fabric or color,

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.030
we decide where to make this stuff cheap.

01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.512
We'll do a big media blitz.
Don't worry. Coop will come around.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.836
Hi there. I'm Dan Patrick.
- And I'm Kenny Mayne.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.519
With the first 7 months out of the way,
the play-off picture is now emerging:

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.990
With last night's victory over Boston

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:51.394
the Beers must beat Indianapolis
to advance to Charlotte,

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.713
then to the National Eastern
Division North to play Tampa.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.031
If the Beers beat Detroit
and Denver beats Atlanta

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:02.831
in the S.W. Division East Northern,
then Milwaukee goes to the Denslow Cup,

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.471
unless Baltimore upsets Buffalo
and Charlotte ties Toronto.

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.030
Then Oakland would play L.A.
And Pittsburgh.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.592
If no clear winner emerges,
a two-man sack race will be held

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.752
till a champion is crowned.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.438
After the gruelling
regular BASEketball season,

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.719
we're now in month 9
of the play-offs.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.755
No, Daddy, don't touch me there!

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.593
The Beers, vying for a slot
in the Denslow Cup. 9th inning.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.831
Ferries up by one, Coop steps in.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.754
Home run!
Coop ties it up.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.720
That could mean extra innings.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:22.837
Who's he? - My entertainment lawyer
for my movie contract.

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.710
Now you're a big shot you're gonna
act in a Hollywood movie?

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.752
Now shooting, number 17,
Doug "Sir Swish" Remer!

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.036
Beers win!

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.113
The Beers have done it.
They're on their way to the Denslow Cup.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.877
Who is that?
- Who's it look like?

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.191
Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:23.796
Hello! Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.953
What's that?
- It's a commitment ring.

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.475
For Jenna?

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:37.667
Yeah, I'm ready to consider
thinking about dating her exclusively.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.314
I'm giving Jenna
a pre-commitment ring,

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.678
to promise to pledge we'll get engaged
as soon as we make a commitment.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.957
You don't care about Jenna!

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:51.113
You were in a hot tub with a Playmate.
- You know what?

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.032
That hurts, man. My clothing line
is saving Jenna's foundation.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:00.911
Sorry, I forgot how much Doug Remer
cares about kids. - Gentlemen!

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.439
Hate to interrupt your celebration,
but this might interest you.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:14.598
Go ahead, don't be shy. Open it.
I think you'll find it interesting.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:19.152
What's that old saying? - "A penny saved
is a penny earned"? "Don't eat cheese... "

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:20.754
Shut up!

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.995
How about "One picture is worth
1,000 words"? - That's a good one!

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:29.039
What low life scum
would use children this way?

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.509
You would!

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.834
Me? Never!

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:37.950
Gentlemen, those are pictures
of the Beers clothing line

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.033
in Calcutta.
- Oh, just great.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.992
If they ever get out, the Beers and
the foundation will be ruined.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.794
But rest assured. No reason to panic.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:55.796
Those pictures never have to see
the light of day, if...

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.952
If what?

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:05.591
If you two
miss the next Beers game.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.117
The next game is the Denslow Cup.
- You've been reading the papers.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.875
Do as I say. Play ball,

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:15.477
and you'll be just fine. - You said
you didn't want us to play ball.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.920
I want you to play ball with me.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.958
You want us to play for Dallas?

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.440
You don't want us to show up at all!
- Of course. It's called blackmail!

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.195
Good evening!

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.390
I told you
this was going to happen!

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.758
If you'd have agreed to Cain's changes
it never would have.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:49.314
Because of you the foundation's screwed.
- Me? - Oh, there you are!

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.037
I saw the pictures.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.192
This is awful! It means the end
of the foundation. It's not endowed

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.309
like...
- Jenna, I can explain.

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:04.029
Yes, it was his fault.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.797
It's your mess, Remer. I should've kept
the team. - Dude... - Enough!

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.879
Look at yourselves! You're just typical
men with humongous egos!

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.793
The kids' lives

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.795
are ruined, and all you can do is argue
about who has the bigger penis.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.758
I mean, child.

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.029
Long wanger...

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.595
Throbbing cock...

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.788
I don't know anymore. - Jenna, wait!
- You've gotta believe us!

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.270
It was all Coop's fault!

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.875
Can we talk over there?
Pig fucker? Can I call you that?

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.430
No, only my friends call me pig fucker.

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:49.439
Know what? You're not my best friend
anymore. How do you like that?

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:52.957
I love it.
- Good. I'm glad.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.598
I'm sick of playing
second fiddle to you.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.389
I'm getting myself
a new best friend.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.389
Wake up, bitch. You're my best friend.
- Really? What?

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.119
Are we going to the zoo?

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:10.997
Fine! I don't need you. I'll get myself
a new best friend, too.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.473
Go ahead. Go back to your fancy cars,
big bank accounts

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.077
your celebrity friends,
and your beautiful women

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.517
and Victoria Silvstedt,
Playmate of the Year.

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.069
Fuck!

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.312
Your life
is spinning out of control.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.316
Seems the whole world
is out to get you.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:35.836
Everything is wrong.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.913
Nothing seems right.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:43.317
There's a sinking feeling inside.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.679
Even your best friend
has turned his back.

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.913
But you can't let it
bring you down.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.550
You gotta fight.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.192
'Cause you try,
but you can't let go.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.953
It's when you're down
that you gotta get up.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.920
Don't let 'em walk all over your face!

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.912
Stand up for yourself

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.471
and make everything right again!

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.509
Even if some guy's trying
to blackmail you.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.514
And your girlfriend thinks
you suck.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.869
It's up to you to let them know
it was some rich guy's evil plan.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:25.916
Look out ahead,
there's a truck changing lanes.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:29.118
You've got crumbs on your upper lip.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.355
Warts on your dick aren't going away,
less you start using cream every day.

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.712
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:43.318
welcome to Calcutta. It is currently
95 degrees with a light drizzle.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:46.280
We hope you enjoy your stay
in lovely Calcutta.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.919
I'm in a hurry!

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.596
Just take me to 7-1-1...

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:06.953
Beerswear Factory.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.157
Hey, you!
- No entrance.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.630
Who the hell are you?
- I factory manager. Who you?

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.670
I Joe Cooper. I mean, I'm Joe Cooper.
- Wait, put on a hard hat!

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.713
This isn't good.
Do the authorities know?

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:33.396
A young man. His whole life
in front of him disappears.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:37.429
A familiar story,
but this is no ordinary Joe.

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.271
Joseph R. Cooper, the most loved
sports figure in the country...

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.669
vanished.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.359
Elsie Melcher, a neighbor
who asked not to be identified, says

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.115
Joe Cooper left his house
2 weeks ago.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.592
According to Angelique Bones,
a nosy bitch who lives up the street,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.673
he took only a toothbrush,
a wallet, a steamer trunk

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:59.036
and a plane ticket
to Calcutta.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.353
Police have several possible scenarios
of what happened

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.752
to the man affectionately known
to the world as "Coop".

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.072
I don't know where he is. He could be
hanging in his closet. - Scenario 1:

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.550
He's hanging in his closet.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:21.995
The night before his disappearance,
Coop's girlfriend paid him a visit.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.674
They quarreled.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.834
You'll find Joe Cooper, wherever
you'll find the most heinous

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.437
and vile exploitation of children.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:35.594
Scenario 2:
Coop went to Disney World.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.479
Here's a photograph taken just days
before his disappearance.

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:47.635
Here's a computer-enhanced simulation
of what he might look like today.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:53.793
From Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
it's the Denslow Cup,

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.475
where the defending champion,
the Dallas Felons,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.758
meet their perennial challengers,
the Milwaukee Beers.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.993
Hello, I'm Al Michaels
along with Bob Costas inviting you

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.073
to join us here at Beers Garden
for Denslow Cup V.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.630
We're in for a classic battle tonight.

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:14.273
You're right. We have over 100 million
people tuned in to see this game.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.148
Many of them, of course,
with no understanding of the sport,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:21.314
but fascinated by the flickering images
and the pretty colors.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:26.714
High up in the stands,
pyrotechnic expert Sergio "Lucky" Ferouch

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:30.510
is readying another spectacular
halftime fireworks display.

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.195
Alright, guys.
You ready to kick some ass?

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.717
What's wrong? Why the long faces?
- Can't win without Coop.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.839
We don't need Coop.
I'll lead you to victory.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.913
We're supposed to be a team.
Without Coop it's not the same.

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.199
Even if Coop was to walk in here now,
it wouldn't change things one iota.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.398
We can win this thing!
Are you with me?

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.995
That's the spirit! Are you with me?

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.675
Coop's here!

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.874
We're underway here
for the Denslow Cup V.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.358
A stunned crowd of over 18,000
witnessing the Beers...

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.478
Come on, Beers! Go, Coop!

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.792
Hey, guys. Thought I told you
we weren't going to watch this game.

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.156
Miss Reed, it's the Denslow Cup!

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.870
These aren't the kind of people
to be emulated.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.113
The severed head
was postmarked Denver.

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.476
The owner still
has not stepped forward.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:58.190
Update: The disappearance of
the Milwaukee Beers baseketball star.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.229
When Joe Cooper discovered that
Beerswear Factory workers were kids,

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.837
not old enough for prostitution,
he personally flew there.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.120
His new, all-adult workforce
now makes a decent wage,

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.911
enjoys full medical benefits
and in-house child care. We are glad

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.356
that such a terrific human being
like Joe Cooper has returned.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:19.069
If I were a woman,
I'd like to be his girlfriend,

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.870
walking in the park,
hand in hand,

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:25.874
wrapping my legs around him,
cuddling in the spoon position

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:30.193
and staring into his eyes
over our morning coffee.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:31.919
Yes, thank you.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.791
In a minute, another unsolved mystery.
- Come on, kids!

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.270
We're going to the game!

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.076
Ladies and gentlemen!
For the 7th-inning entertainment,

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.790
the National Baseketball League
is proud to present

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.589
a salute to our South Sea neighbors:
Viva Calypso!

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.270
We're up 16 to nothing. Have the trucks
pull up to the locker room.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:00.638
We'll sort out the stuff
when we get to Jacksonville.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.033
Hey, Baxter?
I finally got all the chrome off this for you.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.352
Nice.
- You want me to start on this one?

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.838
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:14.118
please direct your attention to the
Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust,

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:18.957
symbol of brotherhood in many
Polynesian countries. In the role

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.593
of the downtrodden but happy natives:
Your Milwaukee Beers!

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.959
Thanks for flying back, Coop.
You really made a difference!

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.590
If not for your mess,
I wouldn't be jetlagged

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.991
and shitting curry.
- Guys, knock it off!

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.433
Representing their white
colonial oppressors:

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.991
The Dallas Felons.
Now let's all join

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.756
our Caribbean brothers
in the ceremonial handshake

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.549
above the Lagoon of Peace.
- Let go!

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.115
Stop it!

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.509
Guys!

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:54.388
Stop it!
- Money-grubber! - Powermonger!

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.268
Die!
- Asshole!

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.557
Would you just stop it?

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.316
Look at you guys, fighting
on the Malaka-Laka board!

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:22.116
You should be ashamed!

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:25.392
Back in the driveway
we were nothing.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.552
Now we've risen to the highest level,

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.349
but you're throwing it all away.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.320
If you've forgotten
what baseketball means to America,

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:37.109
you have only to look at this board,

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.954
the Malaka-Laka Balance Board of Trust.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.998
Don't you see
what we have here?

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.356
A game
where guys with bad backs

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:47.632
and bad knees
can get together and compete

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.270
as guys who are goosed up on steroids.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.358
But more than anything,

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:57.230
isn't this game about being with
your friends and having a good time?

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.513
I remember...

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.390
A long time ago,
I didn't have anybody.

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:08.470
You guys took me in.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.151
That's why it kills me
to see you like this.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.192
If we can't be friends, then the heart
and soul are out of this game.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.350
Certainly out of me.

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:24.270
I know I'll never get that back again.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.835
We have sullied the waters
of the Lagoon of Peace.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.468
I'm begging you,

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:37.191
for the love of our Caribbean brothers,
stop this madness!

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.268
Hang on! - Oh, my God! - Remember
to hold your breath just before we hit.

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:59.239
It is the most spectacular extravaganza
I have ever seen.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.598
You can cram 3 seats into the space
it takes for one wheelchair.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.434
Not to mention the wasted space
for the oxygen bottle!

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.593
Those little shits never pay
full price anyway.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.355
I just realized
I can't stand you!

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.477
You can kiss these puppies goodbye.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.354
Shit, Coop. I'm sorry. I guess
the money did go to my head.

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.035
No, I'm sorry, Remer.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.273
I've got a lot to learn
about sharing.

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.114
Look at me!
I've become everything I used to hate.

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:36.273
Maybe we
just grew up too fast.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.433
My worst enemy turned out to be me.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:42.153
Dude!

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.789
I've got two over.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:00.551
Alright!
Let's go win the championship!

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.232
Hey, that's my wife.
- And this is me!

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.992
What is it? - I hear
your sister's going out with Squeak.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.514
Squeak Scolari
crosses the plate again

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.309
as the Beers have come
roaring back since the break.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.188
This is more like the Beers team
we've seen all season.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.797
9th inning.
Beers still down by 2 runs.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.077
Felons on 1st and 3rd.

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:36.552
The Beers have to stop Dallas
if they want to stay in this game.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.030
The always dangerous Grumsky coming up.

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:44.036
Get this guy. - I don't know what to do.
Nothing works on him.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:49.190
Tell him he's fat.
- That's not cool.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:52.160
No, just do it really subtle.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.675
Subtle...

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.718
You losing weight?

01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:00.359
You're goddam fucking fat...

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.639
The Beers hold them on the 9th
on a clutch psych-out

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.871
by Coop Cooper.

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.358
Bottom of the 9th.
Dallas 16, Milwaukee 14.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.955
Remer on 2nd,
Scolari on 3rd.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.510
Coop's coming up.

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.192
It all comes down to this. One shot.
If Coop makes it,

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.751
the Beers win the Cup
and get to keep the team.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:38.028
Or he misses.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.269
Oh, my God!
LA-Z-BOY has popped!

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.951
The ball Coop has used every day.
A time-out has been called,

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.399
as the Beers star
tries to regroup. - Excuse me,

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:19.395
think you could go any faster?
- Can I go any faster?

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:22.399
Hang on!

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.634
The loss of this ball is going to affect
the outcome of this game.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.595
Come on, kids!

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.629
Just one shot! You can do it!
We can win this thing.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.677
Stop! Don't shoot!

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.355
Here. I brought this for you.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.551
I made it myself. Just like you.
- You made this?

01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.076
Miss Reed helped me for most of it.

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:08.038
But I finished it myself.

01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.829
Joey, this is great.

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.190
Coop, you know what
Miss Reed told me tonight?

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.837
She said she wants me
to be a big sports star.

01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.996
Just like Joe Cooper.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.356
Thanks, dude!
- Go get 'em, Coop!

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.873
When's the last time you made a
homerun without LA-Z-BOY?

01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.398
Al, we've seen some classic
Denslow Cup battles in the past,

01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:08.635
but I can't remember one that rivalled
the drama and excitement of this one.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.593
It's off the rim...

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.753
Could be a double play.
Darcy tips.

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.553
Jansen's try...

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:27.949
No!

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.677
Beers have a shot at the conversion!
Remer keeps it alive!

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.030
Last chance...

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:45.275
Coop up!

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.319
It's...

01:29:56.040 --> 01:29:57.553
...good!

01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:37.237
In all my years of calling games
I've never been this excited.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.313
You're excited?
Feel these nipples!

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.910
Update: We still have no fucking clue
where this guy is.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.677
Alright.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.634
What is it?

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.838
What is it?
- It's Reggie.

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.719
Reggie Jackson.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.154
Well, go! Go ahead!

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.072
Nice going out there.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:19.870
Thanks. You know I gotta tell you,
it's 'cause of you that I'm here.

01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:21.474
That's nice to know.

01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:23.839
I brought this for you!

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.437
I saw some kid in the ballpark with it.
You gotta hang on to that.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.398
I got the two home run balls I hit
in the World Series.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.551
Some little shit got the 3rd one.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:39.990
That sucks. I gotta get my trophy.
Let's have a hot dog sometime.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.470
Alright, sounds good.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.552
I don't have your fucking ball.

01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:51.439
Good luck next year.
- Oh, thanks!

01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:56.595
Got milk?

01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:58.829
I'm sorry.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.158
The National Baseketball League
would like to present to the Beers

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.314
With this year's Denslow Cup.
Congratulations!

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:13.957
Take your victory lap.
As they skate off,

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:18.069
one thinks about a team that conquered
adversity, overcame the odds,

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.396
a team that defied the critics,
a team that...

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.871
And so, the ideal of sports
once again blossomed

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.477
from a tiny seed,
nurtured, as always,

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:33.075
by the dreams of the young.

01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:35.755
I'm the King of the World!
