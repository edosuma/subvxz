00:30.880 --> 00:33.542
<i>Do you really have to go?</i>

00:33.583 --> 00:36.017
You're old enough
to be on your own, Bobby.

00:36.052 --> 00:37.349
Pretty soon the
baby-sitters

00:37.387 --> 00:39.184
are gonna be younger than you.

00:39.222 --> 00:40.314
But... But...

00:40.356 --> 00:41.516
Oh, you'll be fine.

00:41.558 --> 00:43.116
I've gotten rid
of that hat rack

00:43.159 --> 00:44.717
you said looked
like the devil.

00:44.761 --> 00:45.853
Have fun.

00:51.901 --> 00:53.960
A Frankenstein monster?

00:54.003 --> 00:55.527
In this day and age?

00:55.572 --> 00:57.403
I'm telling you kids...

01:04.214 --> 01:05.909
<i>Chuck Storm</i>

01:05.949 --> 01:07.211
on channel five predicts

01:07.250 --> 01:09.810
"possible moderate breeze"
for the camping trip.

01:09.853 --> 01:11.343
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

01:11.387 --> 01:14.823
Yep. I don't know how you girls
get along without us every year.

01:14.858 --> 01:15.847
Heh-heh-heh.

01:15.892 --> 01:17.860
You know, the French onion soup

01:17.894 --> 01:20.260
and the minestrone soup
sound so good,

01:20.296 --> 01:22.161
I think I'm gonna order both.

01:22.198 --> 01:23.426
Two soups?

01:23.466 --> 01:25.161
Yes. In place of an entree.

01:30.406 --> 01:31.498
Hello?

01:31.541 --> 01:32.906
Dad...

01:32.942 --> 01:34.500
<i>I crawled into your bed</i>

01:34.544 --> 01:37.274
to calm me down, but it
just wasn't the same

01:37.313 --> 01:38.712
without you guys here.

01:38.748 --> 01:41.046
Bobby, everything
would have been fine

01:41.084 --> 01:42.517
if you hadn't panicked.

01:42.552 --> 01:44.452
The problem is
you lack confidence.

01:44.487 --> 01:46.250
Give me confidence.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.849
Well, I can't give it to you,
you have to earn it.

01:48.892 --> 01:51.486
Hey, you know, one
of the best ways to do that

01:51.528 --> 01:53.519
is to rely
on yourself in the wild.

01:53.563 --> 01:55.258
Just you against the elements.

01:55.298 --> 01:56.595
I don't know...

01:56.633 --> 01:58.396
I don't want you to get married

01:58.434 --> 02:01.130
and have to have your wife
tuck you in at night.

02:01.171 --> 02:03.071
You're coming
on our camping trip.

02:03.106 --> 02:06.303
Fine, but I don't know
what I can learn in the wild

02:06.342 --> 02:08.936
that I can't learn
watching <i>Zoobilee Zoo</i>.

02:08.978 --> 02:10.775
...and I figure
if we make this

02:10.814 --> 02:12.805
an "eat only what
you catch" trip,

02:12.849 --> 02:15.818
Bobby will be forced
to learn some self-reliance.

02:15.852 --> 02:17.649
That's a great idea.

02:17.687 --> 02:20.121
Once you learn how
to light a cigarette

02:20.156 --> 02:22.420
with two rocks, you
feel invincible.

02:22.458 --> 02:24.983
Yeah, man, just like my
dang ol' Ted Nugent said, man.

02:25.028 --> 02:27.553
You know, they can't no grill,
'less you kill it man.

02:27.597 --> 02:29.963
Like, dang, talking
about an old... foom.

02:29.999 --> 02:33.093
Yeah, I use my survival
training every day.

02:33.136 --> 02:35.263
Yep, being alone in the woods

02:35.305 --> 02:39.173
prepared me for being alone,
well... everywhere else.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.973
Oh, I'm gonna miss Dale, shug.

02:46.015 --> 02:48.074
And I will miss my boys,

02:48.117 --> 02:49.516
but, you know, I see this

02:49.552 --> 02:50.985
as the perfect opportunity

02:51.020 --> 02:53.318
to take care of this
"things to do" list

02:53.356 --> 02:55.381
that has been hanging
over my head.

02:55.425 --> 02:56.858
"See boys off."

02:56.893 --> 02:58.588
Done.

03:04.634 --> 03:05.965
The Park Department

03:06.002 --> 03:10.132
is not responsible
for my safety. Oh, God...

03:10.173 --> 03:11.140
That's right.

03:11.174 --> 03:12.971
You're responsible now.

03:14.510 --> 03:17.707
Oh, already that time
of year again, huh, Hank?

03:17.747 --> 03:19.009
Yeah, looks like it.

03:19.048 --> 03:20.811
How are you, Ranger Bradley?

03:20.850 --> 03:22.545
Working so hard, I
couldn't tell you.

03:22.585 --> 03:23.813
What'll it be... the usual?

03:23.853 --> 03:27.289
Yep, ol' lot number 6347.

03:27.323 --> 03:31.191
We watched that possum family
grow up right before our eyes.

03:35.865 --> 03:38.060
So how does it feel
to be setting up

03:38.101 --> 03:40.069
your own camp
for the first time?

03:40.103 --> 03:42.503
I brushed my teeth
with bug cream

03:42.538 --> 03:44.506
and I'm still kinda woozy.

03:44.540 --> 03:45.666
Can we go home?

03:45.708 --> 03:47.733
No, we've got work to do.

03:47.777 --> 03:49.836
We gotta pick up dinner.

03:52.081 --> 03:53.514
Come here, fish.

03:53.549 --> 03:55.847
I'm not gonna hurt you.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.648
Idiot.

03:58.688 --> 04:01.156
That's three for Dale,

04:01.190 --> 04:04.057
three for me,
four for Boomhauer.

04:04.093 --> 04:06.721
And nada for Bobby,

04:06.763 --> 04:09.095
and since it's an "eat only

04:09.132 --> 04:10.292
what you catch trip,"

04:10.333 --> 04:12.164
tonight, you will
be dining on...

04:12.201 --> 04:15.193
filet of zero.

04:16.238 --> 04:18.036
Shut up, Dale.

04:18.074 --> 04:19.803
Maybe he's right.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.469
I can't do this.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.808
Sure you can, Bobby.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.836
Just remember,
to catch a fish,

04:24.881 --> 04:26.849
you have to think like a fish.

04:26.883 --> 04:32.116
Hmm, I'm wet,
and I don't even know it.

04:33.389 --> 04:35.823
No, where would you be feeding?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.086
Probably in that

04:37.126 --> 04:39.253
algae-covered
area over there.

04:39.295 --> 04:42.093
That algae does
look pretty good.

04:42.131 --> 04:44.258
<i>Nancy, in one day I have</i>

04:44.300 --> 04:46.860
accomplished everything
I set out to do.

04:46.903 --> 04:49.030
Do you think
it would be gilding the lily

04:49.072 --> 04:51.165
to refinance the house
while Hank's away?

04:51.207 --> 04:53.038
Uh-oh, someone's beeping in.

04:53.076 --> 04:54.202
Hello, Peggy. This is

04:54.243 --> 04:55.870
Dora Shelwyn from Tom Landry.

04:55.912 --> 04:56.879
I teach...

04:56.913 --> 04:57.880
Are you retiring?

04:57.914 --> 04:59.176
Uh, no, actually,

04:59.215 --> 05:01.015
I just needed the number
of your veterinarian.

05:01.017 --> 05:02.109
I have a quick question.

05:02.151 --> 05:03.118
Go ahead.

05:03.152 --> 05:04.517
I meant for the vet.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.749
You see, I bought
this myna bird,

05:06.789 --> 05:08.950
and it just won't talk and I...

05:08.992 --> 05:10.186
Put the bird on the line.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.126
What?
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

05:14.497 --> 05:17.660
Okay, bird... Awk!
I love Dora Shelwyn!

05:17.700 --> 05:18.894
Who's a good bird?

05:18.935 --> 05:20.334
I love Dora Shelwyn!

05:21.704 --> 05:24.104
Come on, bird. I got all day.

05:26.175 --> 05:28.336
Awk! I love Dora Shelwyn!

05:38.855 --> 05:39.822
Hey, bro.

05:39.856 --> 05:40.823
What?

05:40.857 --> 05:43.325
Oh, hi.

05:43.359 --> 05:45.827
If you catch anything,
we should use this as a plate.

05:45.862 --> 05:48.262
I haven't even seen
a fish all day

05:48.297 --> 05:49.559
and I'm starving.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.294
I've got a hamburger bun top.

05:51.334 --> 05:54.098
Still has most
of its sesame seeds.

05:55.138 --> 05:56.264
Bobby.

05:56.305 --> 05:57.567
Don't take that.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.599
It's okay... we
can split it threezies.

06:00.643 --> 06:02.770
Thank you for the, uh, bun,

06:02.812 --> 06:04.973
but we are only eating
what we catch this weekend.

06:05.014 --> 06:08.142
I'm trying to teach
my son self-reliance.

06:08.184 --> 06:12.052
No, <i>I'm</i> trying
to teach him self-reliance.

06:12.088 --> 06:12.816
What?

06:12.855 --> 06:14.186
Yeah. The thing

06:14.223 --> 06:17.852
about self-reliance
is... it's like, bad.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.452
Hugs for smokes.

06:19.495 --> 06:20.655
Look, I...

06:20.696 --> 06:23.096
Oh, God.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.796
Another one?

06:25.835 --> 06:27.598
Okay, I don't know
what's going on,

06:27.637 --> 06:30.868
but you're gonna have to tell
your friends to get out of here.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.340
All of them?

06:38.681 --> 06:40.672
What are they, Dad?

06:42.185 --> 06:44.085
They're hippies, son.

06:45.855 --> 06:48.415
I love you!

06:53.596 --> 06:56.087
Hey, man, I thought
that dang ol' Reagan

06:56.132 --> 06:58.828
got rid of all them in the 'ol
'80s, man, talkin' 'bout

06:58.868 --> 07:00.699
them yippy to yuppy, man.

07:00.736 --> 07:02.397
This land is our land!

07:02.438 --> 07:04.099
Welcome home, friend!

07:05.141 --> 07:06.438
Bobby, back in the tent!

07:06.476 --> 07:07.636
Go away!

07:07.677 --> 07:09.201
And put on some clothes!

07:09.245 --> 07:11.440
Hey, this isn't Kinko's, man.

07:11.481 --> 07:12.914
It's the Gathering!

07:12.949 --> 07:13.847
The what?

07:13.883 --> 07:15.714
The Gathering, bro.

07:15.751 --> 07:17.082
Everyone's here.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.815
Crunchies, and hempies,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.050
Earth Mothers, vegans,
hyper-vegans...

07:21.090 --> 07:22.648
We're all here.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.182
Thousands of us.

07:27.430 --> 07:29.694
This may be
the saddest day of my career.

07:31.234 --> 07:32.758
Ranger, how could you
have given

07:32.802 --> 07:34.326
all these people park permits?

07:34.370 --> 07:35.530
What were you thinking?

07:35.571 --> 07:38.199
Sorry, Hank,
we were blind-sided.

07:38.241 --> 07:41.472
They got a bunch of
ACLU lawyers to sue,

07:41.511 --> 07:43.308
saying the First
Amendment allows them

07:43.346 --> 07:45.280
to peaceably assemble
without a permit.

07:48.284 --> 07:50.775
Don't tell me that's covered by
the First Amendment.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.583
Public defecation is protected

07:52.622 --> 07:54.852
as long as they say
it's a political

07:54.891 --> 07:57.018
or artistic statement.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.152
And they do.

08:06.469 --> 08:08.334
Nothing again.

08:08.371 --> 08:10.532
We'll never catch anything.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.906
Fish hate loud hippie
drums and so do I.

08:13.943 --> 08:15.672

08:15.711 --> 08:19.442

08:34.797 --> 08:36.128
Dang it, if I have to pull

08:36.164 --> 08:37.631
one more hook out of Bill...

08:41.304 --> 08:43.635
Excuse me, sir, but
I could not help noticing

08:43.673 --> 08:45.265
you're making
your salad wrong.

08:45.308 --> 08:46.468
Where are the beets?

08:46.509 --> 08:47.771
Where are the red beans?

08:47.810 --> 08:48.777
I don't know.

08:48.811 --> 08:49.971
You know what, yeah,

08:50.012 --> 08:51.445
we're just going to
have to start all over.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.471
I made a salad last
night that people

08:53.516 --> 08:54.915
are still talking about.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.317
I mean look at us,
we're talking about it.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.617
Fire wood.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.525
Log nappers!

09:08.197 --> 09:10.131
I'm starving, Dad!

09:10.166 --> 09:12.999
Can't you teach me self-reliance
at a restaurant?

09:13.035 --> 09:15.401
I'll order off the adult menu.

09:15.438 --> 09:16.666
Now, calm down.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.571
I found some perfectly
good thorn-apples

09:18.608 --> 09:20.667
and sour berries
in the forest.

09:20.710 --> 09:22.143
You go find us some sticks

09:22.178 --> 09:24.146
and we can roast
them like s'mores.

09:24.180 --> 09:26.740
And do not talk
to any hippies.

09:42.198 --> 09:44.792
My name's Fudgie,
and that's Topaz.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.563
We met on a turnip farm.

09:46.602 --> 09:47.762
Oh.

09:47.803 --> 09:49.498
Whatcha got in the kettle?

09:49.538 --> 09:50.937
Jumbo Gumbo.

09:50.973 --> 09:52.941
How much does it cost
for a bowl?

09:52.975 --> 09:54.943
Everything here
is free, little guy.

09:54.977 --> 09:57.571
This ain't
the Ronald McMoney scene.

09:57.613 --> 10:00.582
People here share
with one another.

10:00.616 --> 10:04.450
You give what you can
and you get what you need.

10:04.487 --> 10:06.682
I don't know if I should.

10:06.722 --> 10:10.214
My dad said I can
only eat what I catch.

10:10.259 --> 10:11.726
Then catch.

10:15.131 --> 10:17.326
So you're sure this is okay?

10:17.366 --> 10:20.062
My dad wants me to be
self-reliant.

10:20.102 --> 10:22.195
In a hundred years,
who's going to care

10:22.238 --> 10:24.001
if you were
self-reliant or not?

10:30.746 --> 10:34.273
You make a good point, Fudgie.

10:35.685 --> 10:37.312
No thank you.

10:37.353 --> 10:39.412
I'll probably catch
a deer tomorrow

10:39.455 --> 10:41.548
and I want to make
sure I'm hungry.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.251
Good for you, Bobby.

10:43.292 --> 10:44.850
You're really
hanging in there.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.861
You know what?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.328
If you can wait, I can wait.

10:47.363 --> 10:48.830
Good-bye, gentlemen,

10:48.864 --> 10:50.229
and good riddance.

10:50.266 --> 10:53.258
I'm one chorus of "Truckin" '
away from snapping.

10:53.302 --> 10:56.567
Yeah, man, like that dang ol' mandolin,
man ain't never sounded so bad.

10:56.605 --> 10:59.369
Like a dang ol' Bill Monroe spinning
his dang ol' grave, man.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.774
What? You guys can't
get up and leave now.

11:01.811 --> 11:03.904
What kind of lesson
is that for Bobby?

11:03.946 --> 11:05.072
A good one.

11:05.114 --> 11:06.638
He can learn
from our bad example.

11:06.682 --> 11:09.310
Well, I guess
self-reliance

11:09.352 --> 11:11.684
isn't for everyone, Dad.

11:15.624 --> 11:18.286
Stellar gumbo, Fudgie,
just stellar.

11:18.327 --> 11:21.160
This time, don't skimp
on the potatoes.

11:21.197 --> 11:22.289
Dig deep.

11:22.331 --> 11:24.595
Sorry, but the gumbo's
gone-bo.

11:24.633 --> 11:27.466
Oh. That's okay.

11:27.503 --> 11:30.301
I should probably be getting
back to my campsite anyway.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.330
Hold on, little guy.

11:32.375 --> 11:33.569
The pot's empty.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.600
It's time for you to share up.

11:35.644 --> 11:37.839
Uh, I don't have anything.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.646
But in a hundred years,
who's going to care, right?

11:41.684 --> 11:44.448
Fudgie's hungry now.

11:46.021 --> 11:48.080
...and then I'm going
to share your cooler.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.456
You think your dad's got
any money we could share?

11:53.763 --> 11:56.732
Hey, I can trade
these for a burrito.

11:56.766 --> 11:58.597
Wait!

11:58.634 --> 12:00.659
Those are my dad's
fishing poles.

12:00.703 --> 12:01.897
You can't take those.

12:01.937 --> 12:03.802
We only want to share, guy.

12:03.839 --> 12:06.171
You didn't mind sharing
our gumbo, did you?

12:06.208 --> 12:08.005
No.

12:08.043 --> 12:09.670
So we're sharing back.

12:09.712 --> 12:11.407
It's the law of Karma.

12:11.447 --> 12:13.347
Promise that
you'll bring them back

12:13.382 --> 12:14.815
before my dad gets here.

12:17.286 --> 12:18.981
So we're agreed, right?

12:19.021 --> 12:20.818
You'll bring them back?

12:22.625 --> 12:24.183
Yeah, man, sure.

12:27.596 --> 12:29.188
Still no sign of Bill.

12:29.231 --> 12:31.358
Probably got his head
stuck in something.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.630
But I'm sure he'll turn up
once we start cooking

12:33.669 --> 12:35.159
those fish
we're about to catch.

12:35.204 --> 12:36.933
Actually, I'm in the mood

12:36.972 --> 12:38.564
for more thorn berries,

12:38.607 --> 12:40.131
or maybe a pine cone.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.269
Bobby, the fishing rods
are gone!

12:42.311 --> 12:44.575
You were supposed to be
watching this stuff.

12:44.613 --> 12:48.379
I-I'm sure whoever took them
will bring them right back.

12:48.417 --> 12:51.545
Thieves don't
return stolen items.

12:51.587 --> 12:53.214
It's just a thing, Dad.

12:53.255 --> 12:55.018
They didn't steal
something important,

12:55.057 --> 12:57.287
like a smile, right?

12:57.326 --> 12:59.123
Bobby, that's
just hippie talk,

12:59.161 --> 13:01.322
and all the hippie talk
in the world

13:01.363 --> 13:03.160
isn't going
to get our stuff back.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.895
We have to actually
do something about it.

13:15.144 --> 13:18.602
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a couple of fishing rods.

13:18.647 --> 13:21.445
Dual paddle crank handles,
12-pound lines.

13:21.484 --> 13:23.315
Never mind.

13:23.352 --> 13:26.048
I'm really sorry to hear about

13:26.088 --> 13:28.215
your fishing poles, man.

13:28.257 --> 13:30.054
Uh... okay.

13:30.092 --> 13:33.027
If anyone can help you,
it's the Council Circle.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.758
There's some real
wise bastards there.

13:35.798 --> 13:38.824
Uh... thanks.

13:38.868 --> 13:41.428
Hey, can you
give me some money?

13:41.470 --> 13:42.437
No.

13:42.471 --> 13:43.938
Fascist.

13:43.973 --> 13:45.600
It's only with teamwork

13:45.641 --> 13:48.201
that we can find Apple-Seed's
missing teeth.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.905
Uh, pardon me.

13:49.945 --> 13:52.641
Hank Hill, assistant manager,
Strickland Propane.

13:52.681 --> 13:53.579
Shut up!

13:53.616 --> 13:54.640
Quiet!

13:54.683 --> 13:55.775
What gives you the right?

13:55.818 --> 13:57.911
The rules say you can't speak

13:57.953 --> 14:00.012
unless you got the feather.

14:00.055 --> 14:01.989
Aw, Bill.

14:02.024 --> 14:03.423
Hey, Hank...

14:03.459 --> 14:06.917
my new name is Energy Turtle.

14:06.962 --> 14:08.759
I've found myself.

14:08.797 --> 14:09.923
Bill, fun's over.

14:09.965 --> 14:12.297
Wash that mud off now,
and help me find

14:12.334 --> 14:13.631
my fishing rods.

14:13.669 --> 14:14.897
Oh, Hank.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.838
I bet you searched
for them everywhere...

14:17.873 --> 14:19.204
except your heart.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.674
Get out of the Circle!

14:20.709 --> 14:21.869
He's serious.

14:21.911 --> 14:23.879
No Being may speak
without the feather.

14:23.913 --> 14:25.505
Okay! Where are
my fishing rods?

14:25.548 --> 14:26.947
Hey, why'd you come

14:26.982 --> 14:29.280
to a Gathering
if you didn't want to share?!

14:29.318 --> 14:32.481
I didn't come to the Gathering!
The Gathering came to me!

14:32.521 --> 14:34.455
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll come to you

14:34.490 --> 14:36.390
and gather... your...
your face!

14:36.425 --> 14:38.188
All right.
Negative vibes!

14:38.227 --> 14:39.626
Negative vibes!

14:39.662 --> 14:40.982
This Circle will
resume discussion

14:40.996 --> 14:44.397
after a round
of jumping jacks.

14:44.433 --> 14:45.593
Oh, God!

14:45.634 --> 14:47.329
Don't ruin jumping jacks.

14:53.609 --> 14:56.373
Looks like we're going
to have to drive

14:56.412 --> 14:58.312
into town to get new poles.

14:58.347 --> 15:00.144
Bobby, my truck is gone!

15:00.182 --> 15:01.444
What happened?!

15:01.483 --> 15:03.781
Hey, a talking bear!

15:05.521 --> 15:07.045
Ugh! My sleeping bag!

15:07.089 --> 15:08.886
Your nudity!

15:08.924 --> 15:11.290
Calm down.
You can join us.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.522
Yeah, you can hold the Yanni.

15:13.562 --> 15:15.792
Bobby, what is going on here?

15:17.900 --> 15:20.130
Dad...

15:20.169 --> 15:22.603
I ate hippie gumbo!

15:22.638 --> 15:24.401
What? No!

15:24.440 --> 15:26.374
I know I was
supposed to be self-reliant,

15:26.408 --> 15:27.636
but I was hungry.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.837
And I didn't think
I'd ever catch anything,

15:29.878 --> 15:31.903
and they said
since they shared with me,

15:31.947 --> 15:33.744
I had to share our stuff
with them.

15:33.782 --> 15:36.342
And then they shared our stuff
all over the place,

15:36.385 --> 15:37.477
and I'm sorry.

15:44.627 --> 15:46.959
My name's Fudgie.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.333
Oh, divine Sun!

15:53.369 --> 15:55.599
Oh, divine Sun!

15:55.638 --> 15:58.835
We observe your holy wisdom!

15:58.874 --> 16:01.866
We observe your holy wisdom!

16:01.910 --> 16:04.811
So... the sun is God?

16:04.847 --> 16:06.007
Yes!

16:06.048 --> 16:07.481
Wow.

16:07.516 --> 16:09.575
<i>The security camera shows</i>

16:09.618 --> 16:11.779
that your truck
hasn't left the park.

16:11.820 --> 16:13.879
We'll monitor the exit
at all times

16:13.922 --> 16:15.389
to make sure it doesn't.

16:15.424 --> 16:17.483
What's your advice here?

16:17.526 --> 16:20.586
Just sit tight. This park covers
1,000 square miles.

16:20.629 --> 16:22.756
And it's mushroom season.

16:22.798 --> 16:25.358
Your truck could be anywhere.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.564
Dad, I'm sorry
I ruined the trip.

16:28.604 --> 16:30.367
It was all my fault.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.703
Yes. Yes, it was.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.368
But, uh, you just
took responsibility

16:34.410 --> 16:35.809
and admitted it.

16:35.844 --> 16:39.245
That's the first step
towards self-reliance.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.077
What are you doing?

16:42.117 --> 16:44.608
I'm calling your mom
to come pick us up.

16:44.653 --> 16:48.453
I guess I'll have to come back
later and pack out my truck.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.458
You mean, we're just giving up?

16:50.492 --> 16:52.619
The hippies have us
surrounded, Bobby.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.151
There's nothing we can do.

16:54.196 --> 16:55.163
But, Dad,

16:55.197 --> 16:56.391
if we just give up,

16:56.432 --> 16:59.094
the hippies might keep
coming back forever.

16:59.134 --> 17:01.602
They are like locusts,
but I don't know

17:01.637 --> 17:03.605
what the heck we
can do about it.

17:03.639 --> 17:06.733
I guess we'll just camp
somewhere else next year.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.935
Well, maybe
it's like what you said:

17:08.977 --> 17:12.640
If you want to catch a fish,
you have to think like a fish.

17:12.681 --> 17:14.808
We just have
to think like hippies!

17:14.849 --> 17:16.750
That is impossible.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.582
Come on, Dad.
Just try.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.416
Okay, I'm a hippie...

17:20.455 --> 17:24.085
I'm naked,
because I smoked all my clothes.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.093
Uh, yeah.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.185
Yeah.

17:26.228 --> 17:27.957
And I don't like to work.

17:27.996 --> 17:29.156
Right.

17:29.198 --> 17:31.257
I like everything
handed to me.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.825
I'm just like a kid!

17:33.869 --> 17:39.068
Right! An overgrown kid who
can't take care of himself.

17:42.678 --> 17:45.977
Figures this is the
one place they're not burning incense.

17:46.014 --> 17:47.538
Stay in school, son.

17:47.583 --> 17:50.177
You know, Ranger Bradley,
the First Amendment

17:50.219 --> 17:52.779
guarantees the hippies
the right to be here.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.584
But as Bobby was pointing out,

17:54.623 --> 17:57.922
does it guarantee them the right
to these park services?

17:57.960 --> 17:59.552
Yeah, the ranger station

17:59.595 --> 18:01.722
shouldn't have to deal
with this.

18:01.764 --> 18:03.197
You're telling me.

18:03.232 --> 18:06.167
Did you know that hippies
are the number-one source

18:06.201 --> 18:08.328
of airborne and
riverborne pollution?

18:08.370 --> 18:11.237
Right in front of
Dow Chemical and Mexican trucks.

18:11.273 --> 18:13.571
Uh, I'm not sure about that,

18:13.609 --> 18:16.669
but, uh, these hippies
have got to go.

18:16.712 --> 18:18.043
What would you say

18:18.080 --> 18:19.945
to Bobby and me taking care
of them ourselves?

18:19.982 --> 18:21.074
Great!

18:21.116 --> 18:22.583
How many fire hoses
do you need?

18:22.618 --> 18:25.212
I've got some pepper spray
that could take down a bear.

18:25.254 --> 18:26.812
Uh... uh-huh.

18:26.855 --> 18:30.052
Or maybe we could just cut off
some of the park's services.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.617
Well, that doesn't sound
quite as interesting,

18:32.661 --> 18:34.185
but you're on your own.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.337
Okay, what do we got?

18:46.375 --> 18:48.434
But I'm on a roll!

18:48.477 --> 18:51.935
I want to give strokes
and warm fuzzies to Bubbleman

18:51.980 --> 18:54.847
for creating
limitless bartering periods...

18:54.883 --> 18:56.942
Bobby, grab the feather
for me.

18:56.985 --> 18:59.351
But I wasn't finished
with my heart song!

18:59.388 --> 19:00.616
Attention, people!

19:00.656 --> 19:02.681
Minutes ago, I spoke
with the Ranger,

19:02.724 --> 19:04.817
and due to unforeseen
circumstances,

19:04.860 --> 19:08.557
all services in the park will be
cut off, effective immediately.

19:08.597 --> 19:09.621
What?!

19:09.665 --> 19:11.132
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

19:11.166 --> 19:14.294
This means the port-a-potties are
no longer available.

19:14.336 --> 19:16.304
We have a right
to those potties!

19:16.338 --> 19:17.896
Yes, we do. Yeah!
I have the runs!

19:17.940 --> 19:20.807
Clean water will no
longer be provided to you,

19:20.843 --> 19:22.276
and as of this moment,

19:22.311 --> 19:25.041
the park's snack bar is closed.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.775
No snacks?! What?!

19:26.815 --> 19:28.976
Hey, uh, is it just me,

19:29.017 --> 19:32.612
or am I picking up some
negative vibes out there?

19:32.654 --> 19:34.849
Well here's a positive vibe
for you...

19:34.890 --> 19:38.018
you don't need the park
to provide services for you,

19:38.060 --> 19:39.994
because we're gonna
show you how,

19:40.028 --> 19:41.495
with a little hard work,

19:41.530 --> 19:43.430
you can take care
of yourselves.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.726
Grab the feather!

19:45.767 --> 19:47.291
Yeah, this'll be great!

19:47.336 --> 19:49.804
We'll teach you how
to dig your own latrines,

19:49.838 --> 19:53.069
maintain your own roads,
purify your own water,

19:53.108 --> 19:54.803
and catch your own fish.

19:54.843 --> 19:58.802
So, what do you say?
Who here is ready to work?

20:06.054 --> 20:07.385
Rumsfeld.

20:07.422 --> 20:09.583
So long now.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.786
Hank, Bobby...

20:11.827 --> 20:15.456
I came to say good-bye,
and wish you much love.

20:15.497 --> 20:16.862
Where are you going?

20:16.899 --> 20:19.834
Dallas. The Phish is playing
a musical concert there.

20:19.868 --> 20:22.166
We're all gonna live
in the parking lot.

20:22.204 --> 20:23.364
See ya.

20:23.405 --> 20:25.896
Will we ever see
Mr. Dauterive again?

20:25.941 --> 20:27.704
Around the 15th.

20:27.743 --> 20:31.543
That's when he has to report back
to work, or he's AWOL.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.980
Go to hell!

20:34.016 --> 20:35.381
Good riddance!

20:35.417 --> 20:37.783
