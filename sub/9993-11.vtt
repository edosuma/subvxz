00:22.927 --> 00:23.563
You okay?

00:24.361 --> 00:25.748
I think it overheated.

00:33.081 --> 00:34.090
That much steam,

00:34.141 --> 00:35.383
it's probably a good bet.

00:35.896 --> 00:39.100
I started to call Triple-A,
and then my battery died.

00:39.858 --> 00:41.705
I don't suppose I could use yours.

00:42.077 --> 00:43.719
Sorry.
I left it at home.

00:44.353 --> 00:45.324
But if you want a ride to town,

00:45.375 --> 00:47.388
I'd be happy to drop you at the gas station.

00:56.872 --> 00:58.053
No, thanks.

00:58.932 --> 00:59.861
- You mind if I...?
- Oh, it's fine.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.574
My boyfriend smokes, too.

01:21.843 --> 01:22.599
What?

01:26.208 --> 01:27.841
Sorry. It's just,
I'm an artist.

01:30.978 --> 01:33.688
There's this project I'm working on you'd be perfect for.

01:38.954 --> 01:39.892
Is that your dog?

01:41.259 --> 01:42.185
That's Buster.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.180
Shepherd, right?

01:48.975 --> 01:51.126
I thought you said you left your cell phone at home.

01:54.093 --> 01:55.410
Hmm. Could have sworn I did.

01:56.188 --> 01:57.563
May I use it?

01:58.375 --> 01:59.297
Please?

02:00.447 --> 02:03.572
Just about a few more miles to the gas station.

02:03.947 --> 02:06.339
Still, I'd like to call my boyfriend.

02:07.114 --> 02:08.334
Tell him where I am.

02:08.798 --> 02:10.122
Tell him where to meet me.

02:12.682 --> 02:13.879
Please?

02:18.714 --> 02:20.360
Not a problem.

02:25.056 --> 02:25.882
Oh!

02:33.004 --> 02:35.221
You ever think about those Ancient Greek statues?

02:37.770 --> 02:39.725
How hard it must have been back then?

02:41.865 --> 02:44.246
First, you had to find the perfect piece of stone,

02:44.970 --> 02:47.469
excavate it from wherever it is you found it,

02:48.932 --> 02:50.456
haul it back to your studio,

02:51.001 --> 02:52.434
I can't even imagine how.

02:54.202 --> 02:55.603
And all that...

02:56.278 --> 03:00.333
is before the artist could begin his work.

03:03.361 --> 03:05.159
My process is a lot like that.

03:07.732 --> 03:08.766
The hardest part?

03:09.662 --> 03:11.542
Finding the perfect canvas.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.913
That... would be you.

03:19.188 --> 03:19.939
Ugh!

03:31.367 --> 03:32.451
You coming to bed soon?

03:33.622 --> 03:35.487
Just nodded off doing my homework.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.015
I don't know how you do it.

03:38.066 --> 03:41.035
I don't know how you look at that grisly stuff every night.

03:41.728 --> 03:44.232
It's been a month now.
This guy's out there hacking up girls.

03:44.698 --> 03:47.552
You're staring at pictures of his victims,
hoping to dream about him.

03:47.973 --> 03:49.495
Me? I would have given up by now.

03:50.239 --> 03:51.378
Yeah. It's my job.

03:52.468 --> 03:53.703
And by the way,

03:53.826 --> 03:54.883
it just happened.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.077
What do you mean?
What just happened?

03:58.373 --> 03:59.443
You finally had one?

03:59.505 --> 04:01.699
After all this time,
you finally had a dream about this guy?

04:02.887 --> 04:03.934
It was nothing big.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.271
I mean, I saw the victim.

04:06.857 --> 04:09.353
The rest of it didn't make a lot of sense,

04:10.846 --> 04:12.636
but at least I saw the victim.

04:13.091 --> 04:14.447
I guess that's a start.

04:15.310 --> 04:16.039
That's it?

04:16.509 --> 04:18.315
You finally have a big breakthrough,
and all you can say is,

04:18.366 --> 04:19.495
"I guess that's a start?"

04:20.089 --> 04:21.577
I would think you'd be more excited.

04:22.807 --> 04:24.423
Yeah, I know.

04:25.261 --> 04:26.212
The thing is,

04:26.397 --> 04:28.099
I'm not really myself tonight.

05:15.099 --> 05:17.517
Patricia Gilmartin, age 24.

05:18.978 --> 05:20.780
Works as a hostess at a restaurant downtown.

05:21.781 --> 05:23.753
We're positive this is the work of our guy?

05:24.474 --> 05:27.067
The same brand of filter-less he left at the other three crime scenes.

05:27.874 --> 05:29.232
Found them outside in the alley.

05:29.685 --> 05:30.801
Five cigarettes.

05:33.322 --> 05:35.605
He must have been waiting out there for over an hour.

05:36.381 --> 05:37.626
He's a patient perv.

05:39.636 --> 05:42.300
I get the feeling the anticipation's a big part of it for this guy.

05:42.555 --> 05:43.957
The way he hangs onto them.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.254
Keeping 'em alive...

05:46.561 --> 05:48.250
cutting them, cutting them,

05:48.477 --> 05:49.402
cutting them...

05:51.137 --> 05:51.737
...until finally,

05:51.717 --> 05:53.941
they can't bear it any longer,
and they just expire.

05:54.125 --> 05:55.754
I don't want to find this one in a Dumpster, Lee.

05:55.805 --> 05:58.122
I don't want to find this one in a landfill.

05:58.318 --> 05:59.930
If he took her last night, then she's still alive.

05:59.981 --> 06:02.884
If he took her last night, then he's still enjoying her.

06:05.445 --> 06:07.183
Hang on. We need to find her.

06:07.659 --> 06:08.290
Knock, knock.

06:08.341 --> 06:09.683
Sorry  I'm late.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.009
My youngest-- she was having issues with potty training.

06:13.518 --> 06:14.118
It's okay.

06:13.847 --> 06:16.094
You didn't miss anything except your boss's foul mood.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.320
The boys have already been through the bedroom.

06:18.598 --> 06:19.477
There's nobody in there,

06:20.440 --> 06:22.568
if you want to go in,
see if you get anything or whatever.

06:23.071 --> 06:23.671
Sure.

06:24.823 --> 06:29.674
Oh, remind me to tell you about a very
interesting program I saw last night.

06:30.222 --> 06:31.076
It was the first killing,

06:31.127 --> 06:33.578
Kathy Summers. The girl he picked up
on the interstate last month.

06:34.464 --> 06:35.218
And?

06:35.351 --> 06:38.480
And it turns out, he has a dog.

06:39.310 --> 06:41.080
Buster. His name is Buster.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.477
I'm sorry. I guess I'm missing the point.

06:45.677 --> 06:47.621
Well, I guess I figured if we could find him...

06:48.078 --> 06:50.962
Are you suggesting that we try and track down his dog?

06:51.140 --> 06:52.564
Well, it's the only clue I got.

06:52.749 --> 06:54.228
He has a German Shepherd.

06:54.279 --> 06:56.373
It's likely he has a license, and if he does,

06:56.618 --> 06:58.143
his owner's address is on it,

06:58.194 --> 06:59.961
which means our killer's address is on it.

07:00.012 --> 07:03.522
Okay. We'll definitely get somebody on that,

07:03.573 --> 07:04.755
but I'm confused.

07:04.826 --> 07:08.024
If you had a dream about the killer,

07:08.075 --> 07:09.340
if you saw the killer...

07:09.677 --> 07:10.277
But I didn't.

07:10.327 --> 07:11.189
It wasn't that kind of dream.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.234
It was more like,

07:12.420 --> 07:13.638
I felt what he felt.

07:13.689 --> 07:15.239
It wasn't so much about seeing,

07:15.290 --> 07:17.307
it was... it was more about feeling.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.860
Oh,  I'm sorry. I-I...
I'm still not following you.

07:20.485 --> 07:21.085
I don't know...

07:22.094 --> 07:23.131
the hacking...

07:23.367 --> 07:25.311
The hack marks in their skin.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.036
He considers that art.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.109
He considers himself an artist.

07:30.462 --> 07:32.769
He thinks what he does to them is beautiful.

07:33.690 --> 07:34.663
And how do you know that?

07:35.479 --> 07:37.063
Because I was in his head;

07:37.114 --> 07:38.026
I was him.

07:39.104 --> 07:41.422
And that's what I felt when I looked at her.

07:42.889 --> 07:44.112
But it's my turn.

07:44.163 --> 07:44.988
There are no turns.

07:45.039 --> 07:46.449
It's not about turns--
it's mine,

07:46.500 --> 07:48.737
and you're not getting it.

07:48.788 --> 07:50.621
But you've had the top bunk forever.

07:50.877 --> 07:51.954
That's because it's mine.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.376
Just like the bottom bunk is yours.

07:53.660 --> 07:54.447
Forever.

07:54.781 --> 07:55.553
Mom!

07:55.930 --> 07:57.755
Bridge, Ariel got here first,

07:57.806 --> 07:58.859
and if she doesn't want to switch,

07:58.910 --> 07:59.971
I'm not gonna make her switch.

08:00.202 --> 08:01.671
But that's not fair!

08:01.720 --> 08:02.704
It's totally fair.

08:02.753 --> 08:03.459
It's mine.

08:03.506 --> 08:04.613
And you're not getting it.

08:04.949 --> 08:06.629
Not until I go to college anyways.

08:06.772 --> 08:08.118
Oh, and when's that gonna be?

08:08.169 --> 08:10.281
In, like, a catrillion years?!

08:10.372 --> 08:11.572
Two catrillion.

08:12.245 --> 08:13.673
Sit down, babe. Hello?

08:14.064 --> 08:16.227
Care to hazard a guess as to
how many Shepherds named Buster

08:16.278 --> 08:18.967
have been registered
in Phoenix over the past 15 years?

08:19.046 --> 08:20.832
Uh, ten?

08:21.211 --> 08:22.341
Try 34.

08:22.517 --> 08:24.631
I myself have visited 12 of them this afternoon,

08:24.682 --> 08:28.033
and have yet to come across a single owner
with a mutilated girl on the premises.

08:28.457 --> 08:30.502
Sorry I couldn't give you something more specific.

08:30.949 --> 08:33.207
Uh, it's okay. We all knew it was sort of a Hail Mary.

08:33.296 --> 08:34.703
That said,
if you have any new dreams,

08:34.754 --> 08:37.397
anything that might narrow down the search a little...

08:37.546 --> 08:38.568
I know where to find you.

08:38.916 --> 08:40.664
Looking at Busters.
Wish me luck.

08:41.019 --> 08:41.621
Luck.

09:19.255 --> 09:20.119
Here's what I got.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.377
Guy's got a Shepherd named Buster
who's barking his head off,

09:22.428 --> 09:24.622
a pack of filterless smokes
sitting on the front seat of his car with

09:24.673 --> 09:26.432
what looks to me like blood on the wrapper.

09:26.808 --> 09:27.807
Nobody's answering the door.

09:27.858 --> 09:28.935
Am I waiting for a warrant,

09:28.986 --> 09:31.030
or am I convinced,
based on the blood I see in the car,

09:31.081 --> 09:34.519
that the owner of the house is bleeding
to death and may need police assistance?

09:34.917 --> 09:37.493
If you have a reasonable fear
that a homeowner may be in dire need

09:37.544 --> 09:38.516
of police assistance,

09:38.571 --> 09:40.235
than you have no choice,
Detective Scanlon.

09:40.932 --> 09:42.011
Be sure and call for backup.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.017
Hello?

11:14.545 --> 11:15.925
Three guesses where I'm calling from.

11:17.261 --> 11:19.707
Uh... it sounds like a party.

11:20.072 --> 11:21.585
Well, I guess you could call it that.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.114
I'm at Buster's house.

11:24.017 --> 11:24.897
You're kidding.

11:25.283 --> 11:26.061
Nope.

11:26.646 --> 11:27.811
We found the Gilmartin girl--

11:27.862 --> 11:28.822
alive, by the way.

11:29.262 --> 11:32.527
Turns out old Buster shares this place
with a sick twist by the name of

11:32.578 --> 11:33.509
Albert Marcotto.

11:34.887 --> 11:36.303
Is he there?
Did you catch him?

11:37.087 --> 11:38.639
Caught isn't exactly the right word.

11:38.831 --> 11:40.859
The M.E. is giving him the once-over as we speak.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.550
She thinks he had a coronary sometime last night.

11:44.768 --> 11:45.803
He's dead?

11:46.942 --> 11:49.388
The girl said he went into the bathroom at 11:45,

11:49.439 --> 11:51.563
she heard a crash,
he never came out.

11:53.287 --> 11:53.981
You  still there?

11:54.269 --> 11:55.543
Yeah, I'm here.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.033
11:45, you're sure about that?

11:58.709 --> 11:59.600
There's a clock over the door.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.253
She could see it from where he was keeping her.

12:02.396 --> 12:03.027
Why?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.080
It's nothing, it's just...

12:05.361 --> 12:07.209
that's around the time that I had the dream.

12:08.539 --> 12:09.937
Well,  you can sleep easy tonight.

12:10.284 --> 12:11.603
So can the rest of Phoenix.

12:12.272 --> 12:14.439
Albert Marcotto is a threat no more.

12:21.089 --> 12:22.233
Can I get you anything else?

12:22.482 --> 12:23.749
One more whiskey.

12:25.594 --> 12:27.727
I know it's rude to count,
but that'll be your fifth.

12:27.778 --> 12:29.115
You're right,
it's rude.

12:30.372 --> 12:31.374
Rough day?

12:32.262 --> 12:33.618
No, it was a good one, actually.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.211
I found someone I was looking for.

12:36.032 --> 12:37.010
Friend or family?

12:37.243 --> 12:37.967
Neither.

12:39.078 --> 12:40.721
And yet it's cause for celebration?

12:40.971 --> 12:41.946
Absolutely.

12:44.432 --> 12:45.622
So are you going to tell me who you found,

12:45.672 --> 12:46.967
or do I have to guess?

12:48.705 --> 12:51.569
If you don't mind me saying,
you have the loveliest skin.

12:53.950 --> 12:56.773
Five shots of whiskey and
I start looking good to a lot of folks.

12:56.827 --> 12:58.036
No, I mean it.

12:58.608 --> 13:00.561
You're going to be beautiful when you're 80.

13:01.185 --> 13:02.040
You know that?

13:06.977 --> 13:08.191
That one's on me.

13:20.713 --> 13:22.994
Okay, are you sure I can't call you a cab?

13:24.486 --> 13:25.955
Just get me to my car,

13:26.006 --> 13:27.802
I'll be fine.
I swear to God.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.833
- Okay. This you?
- Yeah.

13:31.674 --> 13:32.932
Let's get you there.

13:34.390 --> 13:35.333
Okay.

13:45.795 --> 13:47.171
Okay, that tears it.

13:47.536 --> 13:51.669
Anyone who can't even open their car door is officially too drunk to be driving.

13:51.742 --> 13:52.894
So, all right,

13:52.952 --> 13:54.618
I'm just going to take these keys,

13:55.100 --> 13:57.303
and we're going to find you another way to get home, okay?

14:14.725 --> 14:19.182
I know I shouldn't take it personally
when you leave our bed in the middle of the night.

14:20.180 --> 14:20.780
I'm sorry.

14:20.821 --> 14:22.387
I just had to look at this.

14:22.749 --> 14:23.800
Of course you did...

14:25.184 --> 14:26.700
it's 3:00 in the morning.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.186
I had a dream about the second killing--

14:29.237 --> 14:31.207
well, the second snatching, really.

14:31.595 --> 14:32.834
Lydia Kyne.

14:32.885 --> 14:36.285
Three days after she disappeared a homeless man found her body in a Dumpster.

14:37.361 --> 14:41.608
Her face was cut up so badly they had to use her dental records to identify her.

14:45.495 --> 14:46.618
Wait a second, I'm confused.

14:47.244 --> 14:51.609
Didn't you say before we went to bed that they caught the guy who did this?

14:51.660 --> 14:52.836
That he was dead?

14:55.982 --> 14:57.545
So what are you dreaming about?

15:01.429 --> 15:02.452
It's weird.

15:03.939 --> 15:04.905
It's the killings.

15:06.751 --> 15:08.992
Well, two of the three, anyway.

15:13.036 --> 15:14.470
Except, when I see them...

15:15.972 --> 15:17.004
I am him.

15:19.801 --> 15:22.240
I see what he sees.
I feel what he feels.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.573
But now he's gone...

15:28.427 --> 15:29.613
...and it's all over.

15:31.660 --> 15:35.050
Joe, I don't know
why I'm being shown these things.

15:36.292 --> 15:39.474
I can't figure out
why I'm being made to feel these things.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.164
You  know what you need?

15:45.585 --> 15:46.544
Sleep.

15:47.325 --> 15:53.475
Dr. Joe says it's time to put these
gruesome pictures to bed and get some sleep.

15:53.785 --> 15:55.836
Really, Dr. Joe?
That's the answer?

15:56.731 --> 15:58.322
I don't know if you've noticed, honey,

15:58.373 --> 16:04.769
but you've managed to amass here quite
a collection of gruesome ginsu flesh pictures.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.830
You'll see,
you'll like it.

16:07.471 --> 16:10.112
You lay down,
close your eyes--

16:10.763 --> 16:11.575
you do nothing.

16:12.075 --> 16:13.483
Mark my words--

16:14.380 --> 16:15.665
it's going to be all the rage.

16:15.957 --> 16:16.891
You excited?

16:17.078 --> 16:18.110
No, scared.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.632
You will teach me?

16:19.874 --> 16:21.517
Don't worry,
I'm the master.

16:22.609 --> 16:24.162
Who wants salsa with their eggs?

16:24.246 --> 16:26.032
Me!

16:28.110 --> 16:29.940
Do my senses deceive me,

16:30.507 --> 16:33.855
or is my wife actually cooking breakfast?

16:34.428 --> 16:36.904
What, you expect these girls to live on cereal alone?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.317
Yeah, do you?

16:38.796 --> 16:40.237
You get back to sleep last night?

16:40.619 --> 16:43.896
Or did you feel compelled to dive back into your box of horrors?

16:44.391 --> 16:45.424
The truth?

16:45.475 --> 16:46.908
I laid there for about an hour,

16:47.352 --> 16:49.943
then I watched TV till it was time to wake the girls.

16:51.201 --> 16:52.655
Well, I suppose that's a start.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.317
Thank you for your encouragement, Dr. Joe.

17:00.046 --> 17:02.165
Oh, I was hoping to get my hair done today,

17:02.216 --> 17:04.310
but the only time Elaine can get me is 3:00.

17:04.362 --> 17:06.026
Is there any way you could pick up the girls?

17:09.076 --> 17:09.957
What?

17:11.568 --> 17:13.335
Starting a little early, aren't we?

17:16.287 --> 17:18.232
And since when do you drink whiskey?

17:18.888 --> 17:19.707
I don't.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.289
I thought I was pouring myself some orange juice.

17:25.587 --> 17:26.221
Al...

17:33.287 --> 17:35.769
"Geronimo frozen pizza."

17:44.368 --> 17:45.140
Damn!

17:50.070 --> 17:51.563
Can I help you find something?

17:55.681 --> 17:56.748
Ma'am, are you okay?

17:59.727 --> 18:02.589
I'm fine;
I was just looking for Geronimo pizza.

18:03.056 --> 18:03.855
Sure.

18:03.906 --> 18:05.508
We have plenty of those,
right over here.

18:10.658 --> 18:11.479
Thanks.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.103
Thanks, Mindy.

19:10.305 --> 19:11.918
You've been sitting out here for a while.

19:11.969 --> 19:14.428
I thought you were maybe waiting to look at the open apartment.

19:14.937 --> 19:15.701
I'm the manager,

19:15.752 --> 19:17.375
I can show it to you if you want.

19:17.446 --> 19:19.385
No, I'm not here to see an apartment.

19:20.929 --> 19:23.233
You lost or something?
You need directions?

19:23.319 --> 19:24.074
I just...

19:24.125 --> 19:25.648
I lost track of time.

19:26.544 --> 19:27.607
I sorry, no...

19:27.716 --> 19:28.829
I have to go now.

19:37.886 --> 19:38.963
I'm home!

19:39.633 --> 19:41.750
I could use some help with the groceries!

19:43.083 --> 19:43.924
Hey!

19:45.982 --> 19:47.261
Car's full of groceries...

19:51.614 --> 19:52.774
It's 20 past 7:00.

19:54.590 --> 19:57.624
Well, it's getting dark so early,
I guess I lost track of...

19:59.479 --> 20:00.330
Mommy,

20:00.487 --> 20:02.345
the bottom of the bag's all wet.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.618
Must have sat in the car longer than I realized.

20:08.771 --> 20:10.965
You know, I've been calling
your cell phone for almost four hours.

20:11.723 --> 20:13.316
I don't know why I wouldn't have heard it.

20:15.039 --> 20:16.962
I must have shut it off without realizing.

20:19.747 --> 20:21.655
Ariel, can you get
the rest of the bags out of the car,

20:21.941 --> 20:22.816
put some stuff away.

20:24.137 --> 20:25.960
Bridgette, watch Marie for a minute.

20:26.011 --> 20:28.114
Mommy and I
need to have a talk in the bedroom.

20:33.434 --> 20:35.058
All right, first,
tell me you're okay.

20:35.186 --> 20:36.305
I'm okay.

20:37.657 --> 20:40.502
You know, we've had these conversations
before about consideration,

20:40.593 --> 20:41.579
about calling.

20:42.000 --> 20:42.846
I know.

20:43.111 --> 20:43.811
I can't find you,

20:43.862 --> 20:44.620
I  don't hear from you,

20:44.671 --> 20:45.542
I call the hair salon--

20:45.593 --> 20:47.558
Elaine said that you never even
showed up for your appointment.

20:47.611 --> 20:48.827
No, I know.

20:48.969 --> 20:50.334
No, I don't think you do know.

20:50.385 --> 20:51.484
For all your empathy,

20:51.535 --> 20:53.019
for all your sensitivity,

20:53.070 --> 20:56.050
I don't think you know what it's like
to sit here with the girls from 3:00 on

20:56.101 --> 20:58.821
and not be able
to answer the question "Where's Mommy?"

20:59.044 --> 21:02.501
No, I do, and I am sorry.

21:12.317 --> 21:13.747
Have you been smoking?

21:15.255 --> 21:17.571
Allison, what the hell is going on?

21:17.622 --> 21:18.573
I don't know.

21:19.287 --> 21:21.166
I-I went to the supermarket.

21:21.305 --> 21:22.533
I saw this girl.

21:22.584 --> 21:23.184
What?!

21:23.227 --> 21:25.924
She was perfect. Just the sort of girl
that Marcotto would go for.

21:26.387 --> 21:26.787
Marcotto?!

21:26.988 --> 21:28.872
What does this have to do with Marcotto?

21:28.923 --> 21:31.987
These girls, to him,
they're like canvases.

21:32.038 --> 21:37.051
These blank spaces just waiting to be
turned into these beautiful works of art.

21:37.479 --> 21:41.050
He, he likes their fresh skin,

21:41.185 --> 21:42.911
the way that they're
kind of innocent-looking,

21:42.962 --> 21:43.979
not a lot of makeup.

21:44.877 --> 21:46.509
I noticed that her name was Mindy,

21:46.560 --> 21:47.771
that she worked there.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.346
When I looked at her,

21:51.764 --> 21:52.831
when I was close to her,

21:52.882 --> 21:56.303
I felt like I had found exactly
what I was looking for.

21:58.047 --> 21:59.416
And I couldn't let her get away.

22:00.262 --> 22:02.108
Sorry, Allison, why do you keep saying "I"?

22:02.159 --> 22:03.438
You weren't looking for anybody.

22:03.489 --> 22:04.793
But it's like I was.

22:06.037 --> 22:09.179
So... I hung around.

22:09.230 --> 22:11.722
I waited for her to shift to end and I followed her.

22:12.945 --> 22:14.189
I followed her home.

22:14.714 --> 22:15.760
I sat there,

22:16.036 --> 22:17.492
my car full of groceries,

22:17.543 --> 22:20.256
and I lit up Marcotto's favorite brand of cigarettes,

22:22.066 --> 22:23.489
and I... I watched her.

22:25.535 --> 22:27.538
I watched her for hours.

22:29.951 --> 22:31.439
You stalked her?

22:35.629 --> 22:37.107
You didn't hurt her,

22:37.222 --> 22:39.707
you didn't touch her, you didn't
confront her in any way, right?

22:40.191 --> 22:42.000
Allison, I'm baffled. Why?

22:42.179 --> 22:44.243
I mean, why would you do something like that?

22:44.294 --> 22:45.235
I'm not sure.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.022
These dreams that I've been having lately,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.958
I just assumed they were coming from some victim,

22:53.284 --> 22:55.632
Someone who wanted me to catch him,

22:55.717 --> 22:57.237
put an end to what he was doing.

22:57.288 --> 23:00.852
But now... I'm pretty sure they're coming from him.

23:02.079 --> 23:03.942
I think he's trying to tell me something.

23:04.070 --> 23:06.577
I-I just don't know what it is.

23:08.951 --> 23:10.587
Maybe he's not trying to tell you anything.

23:10.638 --> 23:12.620
Maybe he's trying to get you to do something.

23:12.671 --> 23:13.271
No!

23:13.358 --> 23:15.524
Uh-uh, that's not what it felt like.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.929
I suddenly became very interested in that girl,

23:19.607 --> 23:21.580
and it was overwhelming,

23:21.734 --> 23:24.014
and it was creepy,

23:24.415 --> 23:26.108
but I was me the whole time.

23:26.258 --> 23:27.472
I knew it was wrong.

23:28.128 --> 23:29.137
I knew I was late.

23:29.188 --> 23:30.488
I knew I should call.

23:30.728 --> 23:32.446
I'm not channeling this guy,

23:32.711 --> 23:35.110
and I'm sure as hell not gonna start killing for him.

23:35.207 --> 23:36.937
Yeah, but you started smoking for him.

23:36.988 --> 23:39.104
No, I smoked in college.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.356
It's in my history.

23:40.407 --> 23:41.873
It's something that I would do.

23:42.453 --> 23:43.427
Cutting people up,

23:43.478 --> 23:45.248
killing people-- no.

23:46.770 --> 23:48.658
Well, I'm glad you're so certain.

23:54.217 --> 23:56.881
I'll have Ariel call, see if she can stay over at Hannah's.

23:57.421 --> 23:59.521
Maybe Alan and Kendall can take Bridgette and Marie.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.855
We can drive them there,
then I'll pick them up,

24:00.906 --> 24:02.646
take them to school in the morning.

24:02.933 --> 24:03.624
What? Why?

24:03.675 --> 24:04.368
Why?

24:04.711 --> 24:05.729
Allison...

24:06.991 --> 24:08.429
did you hear yourself?

24:08.547 --> 24:11.676
You just confessed to me you spent
the last several hours driving around the city,

24:11.726 --> 24:13.819
looking for innocent flesh to carve up.

24:14.438 --> 24:17.058
There's no way in hell I'm letting our girls stay in this house while

24:17.109 --> 24:18.940
you've got this guy in your head.

24:19.060 --> 24:19.696
But, Joe.

24:19.747 --> 24:20.590
But nothing.

24:22.667 --> 24:23.502
I love you, but, frankly,

24:23.553 --> 24:25.198
you're scaring the crap out of me.

24:26.610 --> 24:28.904
I'm sorry.
Just let me make some calls,

24:29.367 --> 24:30.752
get them started packing.

24:31.299 --> 24:33.068
I'll send them in there to say good-bye.

24:33.630 --> 24:37.501
Meantime, maybe you can wash that smell off.

24:51.738 --> 24:52.799
Kids are all fine.

24:57.504 --> 24:59.538
I know you have no control over what's going on.

25:02.270 --> 25:03.377
I don't blame you.

25:08.237 --> 25:09.409
Are you coming to bed?

25:43.369 --> 25:45.468
I want to discuss something important with you.

25:46.062 --> 25:49.183
I want to discuss your legacy.

25:59.527 --> 26:02.816
The first line of your obituary.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.257
The summation of your life.

26:05.308 --> 26:07.057
That's really what we're doing here.

26:07.163 --> 26:10.161
We're giving your life some kind of lasting meaning.

26:16.958 --> 26:19.892
I can tell from your expression you're skeptical.

26:20.916 --> 26:23.001
But you shouldn't be.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.992
It's been several hundred years,

26:27.043 --> 26:31.606
but everyone still remembers The Girl with the Pearl Earrings,

26:33.352 --> 26:35.737
Christina from Christina's World...

26:37.000 --> 26:40.918
...Lisa from the Mona Lisa.

26:43.152 --> 26:44.328
Great art is like that;

26:44.379 --> 26:45.398
it lives forever.

26:46.485 --> 26:47.479
And its subjects...

26:48.981 --> 26:50.414
live forever.

26:58.199 --> 27:00.173
This will only hurt for a minute.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.478
You've got to stop this.

27:20.589 --> 27:21.640
I had another dream.

27:22.251 --> 27:23.623
I skipped over the third victim.

27:23.858 --> 27:24.648
What?!

27:25.107 --> 27:25.948
For God's sake, Allison,

27:25.999 --> 27:27.107
it's the middle of the night!

27:27.445 --> 27:28.404
The killer is dead,

27:28.455 --> 27:29.928
the crime spree is over.

27:29.979 --> 27:32.078
Don't you see? He skipped over the third victim.

27:32.328 --> 27:34.022
The third victim, Julie Paxon.

27:34.073 --> 27:35.163
He skipped right over her.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.592
And had showed me the fourth girl, Patricia Gilmartin,

27:37.643 --> 27:38.640
the one we saved.

27:39.695 --> 27:41.603
I think I know why he showed me that girl in the supermarket.

27:41.924 --> 27:43.749
He wants me to understand what he likes,

27:43.800 --> 27:45.658
what he looks for when he chooses them,

27:45.894 --> 27:47.985
so that when I saw a counterfeit, I would know.

27:48.315 --> 27:49.289
A what?
A counterfeit?

27:49.340 --> 27:50.295
I don't understand.

27:51.398 --> 27:52.371
Julie Paxon.

27:52.556 --> 27:53.776
Her complexion's too dark.

27:53.827 --> 27:55.011
She wears too much makeup--

27:55.062 --> 27:56.050
she looks cheap.

27:56.101 --> 27:57.178
He would never choose her,

27:57.240 --> 27:58.480
never in a million years.

27:58.768 --> 28:00.159
That's why I skipped over her,

28:00.310 --> 28:01.828
That's why I didn't dream about her murder.

28:02.135 --> 28:03.639
Marcotto couldn't send it to me,

28:03.690 --> 28:04.896
'cause he didn't do it.

28:05.273 --> 28:06.329
That's the message, Joe.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.754
That's what he's been trying to tell me.

28:09.129 --> 28:10.483
He didn't kill this woman.

28:11.159 --> 28:12.315
Someone else did.

28:15.245 --> 28:16.613
He's offended?

28:16.977 --> 28:18.409
I believe so, yes.

28:18.469 --> 28:21.459
Albert Marcotto took his "art" very seriously.

28:21.831 --> 28:24.139
When we attributed Julie Paxon's murder to him,

28:24.190 --> 28:25.591
I think he took offense.

28:25.876 --> 28:27.270
I think he finds it insulting,

28:27.491 --> 28:29.180
which is why he's been sending me these dreams,

28:29.231 --> 28:31.577
so we could help restore his "reputation."

28:31.635 --> 28:33.260
Well, you'll forgive me if I don't lose a lot of sleep

28:33.311 --> 28:35.420
worrying about the feelings of a dead sociopath.

28:35.644 --> 28:36.675
That's not the point.

28:36.757 --> 28:37.969
Then what is?

28:38.511 --> 28:41.521
Allison, the inclusion of Julie Paxon in Albert Marcotto's body

28:41.572 --> 28:43.404
count was hardly done arbitrarily.

28:43.858 --> 28:47.057
He was blamed for her death because
she was murdered in precisely the same

28:47.108 --> 28:49.243
horrific manner as his other two victims.

28:49.318 --> 28:51.021
Nevertheless, I think we made a mistake.

28:51.161 --> 28:52.666
You saw the bodies.

28:52.717 --> 28:54.225
You saw how they were violated.

28:54.498 --> 28:57.537
It takes a unique capacity for cruelty
to do that to another human being.

28:57.588 --> 28:58.292
Wouldn't you agree?

28:58.343 --> 28:59.322
Unique, yes.

28:59.373 --> 29:01.007
Impossible to duplicate, no.

29:01.058 --> 29:01.860
What are you saying?

29:01.911 --> 29:03.860
You think we got some sort
of copycat killer on the loose?

29:03.911 --> 29:04.558
Well, maybe,

29:04.609 --> 29:08.547
or maybe it was someone who only intended
to commit one murder: Julie Paxon's;

29:08.705 --> 29:11.553
someone who carved her up
to look like Marcotto's handiwork,

29:11.663 --> 29:13.706
so we wouldn't even
consider another suspect.

29:13.921 --> 29:17.402
Someone's mimicking our serial killer
so precisely they even include

29:17.453 --> 29:20.501
the little details that
we deliberately withheld from the press?

29:20.597 --> 29:21.900
The geometric wound patterns?

29:21.951 --> 29:24.622
The red twine in the ligature marks?

29:24.762 --> 29:26.075
Cops talk to their spouses.

29:26.126 --> 29:27.541
Spouses talk to their friends.

29:28.062 --> 29:30.784
The wrong person could've gotten
these details any number of ways.

29:30.991 --> 29:33.700
All I know is I've been
in this guy's head for a few days,

29:33.751 --> 29:34.703
or he's been in mine.

29:34.754 --> 29:36.185
I've come to know his preferences.

29:36.282 --> 29:37.451
I know his taste.

29:37.646 --> 29:38.980
Julie Paxon isn't it.

29:39.031 --> 29:40.093
She's not his type.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.793
She's too done.

29:41.844 --> 29:44.322
It would be like painting
on a used canvas.

29:44.802 --> 29:47.404
Allison, look at this from my side.

29:47.490 --> 29:48.315
The case is closed,

29:48.366 --> 29:49.444
the crime spree is over.

29:49.495 --> 29:50.815
What possible incentive...

29:50.866 --> 29:51.894
For argument's sake...

29:52.600 --> 29:55.035
on the off-chance there might
actually be another killer out there,

29:55.741 --> 29:59.491
what would it take to get you to open
a new investigation into Julie Paxon's murder?

29:59.712 --> 30:01.505
Short of having another body show up?

30:01.976 --> 30:03.869
Bring me something
more than a bad dream.

30:03.920 --> 30:04.583
Bring me proof--

30:04.634 --> 30:06.489
then maybe I'll consider it.

30:07.619 --> 30:08.914
So, in your professional opinion,

30:08.965 --> 30:10.966
there was nothing different
about Julie Paxon,

30:11.177 --> 30:13.607
nothing that made her
stand out from the first two victims?

30:14.956 --> 30:15.836
She was young,

30:16.041 --> 30:17.610
female, pretty.

30:18.084 --> 30:21.362
I guess what I'm asking is was there
anything forensically different about her?

30:21.413 --> 30:23.276
Maybe she was cut
by something other than a scalpel,

30:23.384 --> 30:25.547
or maybe there's some way
to tell if the cuts were made by

30:25.598 --> 30:27.503
a left-handed person
instead of a right-handed one.

30:32.462 --> 30:35.501
All of the incisions
on all three women were identical.

30:35.584 --> 30:38.426
They were done with a cutting instrument
that featured a blade

30:38.477 --> 30:40.265
no longer than six centimeters--

30:40.371 --> 30:42.049
I'm guessing some kind of scalpel.

30:42.488 --> 30:43.468
And as far as I can tell,

30:43.519 --> 30:45.433
they were all made
by a right-handed cutter.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.417
So you're certain this was
all the work of the same man.

30:48.829 --> 30:50.130
Why? Was there ever any question?

30:50.627 --> 30:51.776
We're just trying to be thorough.

30:52.272 --> 30:55.663
Well... then today's your lucky day.

30:55.722 --> 30:57.423
This just came in from the DNA lab.

30:57.671 --> 30:59.509
It confirms that a piece of skin we found

30:59.560 --> 31:02.791
under one of Ms. Paxon's fingernails
belonged to Albert Marcotto.

31:03.766 --> 31:04.798
She scratched him.

31:05.183 --> 31:06.118
Apparently.

31:11.775 --> 31:13.707
Hello, I'm home.

31:21.337 --> 31:22.109
Hey.

31:23.133 --> 31:23.928
Hey.

31:25.971 --> 31:26.959
They're not here?

31:28.105 --> 31:29.077
They're not back?

31:30.723 --> 31:31.765
They were, but...

31:32.030 --> 31:33.055
But what?

31:33.937 --> 31:35.572
I want my kids back!

31:36.064 --> 31:37.018
Now!

31:37.590 --> 31:38.415
No.

31:38.854 --> 31:39.915
Not just yet.

31:40.235 --> 31:41.337
What is this?

31:41.388 --> 31:42.111
It's yours.

31:43.224 --> 31:44.466
Or at least you wrote it.

31:45.065 --> 31:48.909
I found it
with all the other evidence in this box.

31:49.588 --> 31:50.678
I thought maybe I could help.

31:50.729 --> 31:51.843
I figured I'd take a look in here,

31:51.894 --> 31:54.492
see if I could get a better handle
on what it is that you're going through.

31:54.603 --> 31:55.524
But then I saw that,

31:55.787 --> 31:57.828
and I figured out
I was in way over my head.

31:58.058 --> 31:59.799
And frankly, so are you.

32:00.569 --> 32:01.345
I don't understand.

32:01.396 --> 32:02.167
What is this?

32:02.600 --> 32:04.020
I don't know. You tell me.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.415
That's the pad
you were writing in last night.

32:07.162 --> 32:08.048
I didn't write this.

32:08.099 --> 32:09.000
I was writing notes,

32:09.051 --> 32:10.338
theories about this case.

32:10.389 --> 32:11.818
Well, it goes on for nine pages,

32:11.872 --> 32:13.030
Al, all in your handwriting.

32:13.406 --> 32:14.679
No notes, no theories,

32:14.730 --> 32:17.215
just "It was me"
over and over and over again.

32:22.795 --> 32:25.343
Doesn't... make any sense.

32:27.251 --> 32:28.499
I don't remember.

32:32.573 --> 32:35.247
That's all the more reason
to keep the girls away for one more night.

32:41.162 --> 32:42.438
It's just one more night.

32:43.783 --> 32:45.142
I'm sorry.
I know it's hard.

32:46.323 --> 32:48.628
I know you don't choose
to have this guy in your head.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.129
He's a bastard.

32:50.266 --> 32:51.409
He's scaring you,

32:51.896 --> 32:53.145
he's scaring me.

32:54.377 --> 32:55.343
I feel like an ass.

32:55.394 --> 32:57.243
I spent the whole day defending him.

32:57.827 --> 32:59.253
Now even he said he did it.

33:00.879 --> 33:04.367
The medical examiner
found his DNA under her fingernails--

33:04.479 --> 33:05.470
Julie Paxon's.

33:10.509 --> 33:12.494
You've given this animal
enough of your nights.

33:14.595 --> 33:15.949
It's time you took one for yourself.

33:32.905 --> 33:34.891
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

33:34.942 --> 33:36.584
500 on the pass.

33:37.888 --> 33:40.175
25 on the yellow,
three, four hopping.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.500
Same shooter.

33:44.691 --> 33:45.881
Lucky shooter.

33:52.796 --> 33:53.993
Seven winner!

33:55.995 --> 33:57.935
Well, looks like
it's my walking-away time.

33:59.267 --> 34:00.697
Feel like you're cooling off?

34:00.873 --> 34:02.097
Nope, I'm just getting started.

34:02.148 --> 34:05.342
I'm gonna put it all on
my Arizona boys to take UCLA.

34:05.641 --> 34:06.471
You better hurry up.

34:06.522 --> 34:08.496
They tip off in about 15 minutes.

34:09.215 --> 34:10.411
There you go...

34:12.067 --> 34:13.978
$10,000 right there.

34:14.029 --> 34:15.588
And 25.

34:17.835 --> 34:19.699
Think I'll keep this one for luck.

34:26.813 --> 34:27.922
You all right?

34:29.755 --> 34:32.322
No, I'm better than all right.
I'm great.

34:34.018 --> 34:37.719
I had a dream... starring me,

34:37.771 --> 34:39.319
and I didn't kill anybody.

34:39.632 --> 34:42.077
Mm... Hallelujah.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.763
I won a bunch of money playing craps.

34:47.114 --> 34:50.206
I bet $500 on the pass line and it paid off.

34:55.389 --> 34:56.156
Wait a second.

34:56.254 --> 34:59.022
You laid $500 on the pass line?

34:59.211 --> 35:00.050
Mm-hmm.

35:02.073 --> 35:04.283
Since when do you know how to play craps?

35:06.477 --> 35:07.912
Since last night, I guess.

35:08.861 --> 35:09.710
It was fun.

35:10.169 --> 35:11.550
We should go to Las Vegas.

35:16.659 --> 35:17.597
What?

35:17.708 --> 35:20.417
You told me to dream
about anything other than Marcotto.

35:21.075 --> 35:23.763
It's not my fault
my brain picked Sin City.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.208
Al, in the 13 years we've been married,

35:26.259 --> 35:28.573
the only time
I've ever seen you roll dice

35:29.474 --> 35:31.887
is when we're playing
Chutes and Ladders with the girls.

35:31.938 --> 35:34.519
And now, suddenly,
you're an expert?

35:36.736 --> 35:38.471
Which sort of begs the question:

35:40.072 --> 35:45.822
Was it your vacation you dreamt about
or was it someone else's?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.631
Remind me again
what we're doing here.

35:59.863 --> 36:00.977
It's a crazy long shot,

36:01.028 --> 36:04.572
but I think Marcotto wants me
to help him establish an alibi.

36:06.456 --> 36:07.725
I had another dream last night.

36:08.582 --> 36:10.190
Took me awhile to figure it out,

36:10.241 --> 36:12.580
but I think
I was playing his part again.

36:12.967 --> 36:13.786
I was in Las Vegas,

36:13.837 --> 36:18.774
and I was putting a bet down on a
basketball game between UCLA and Arizona.

36:19.785 --> 36:21.139
Hope you bet on the Bruins.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.646
That game was a blowout.

36:22.917 --> 36:24.135
Come to Mama.

36:24.792 --> 36:25.765
I checked the dates.

36:25.816 --> 36:28.415
The only time those two teams
played was November 24,

36:28.466 --> 36:32.033
which is the day that Julie Paxon
was kidnapped and murdered.

36:32.377 --> 36:34.881
So if my hunch is correct,

36:35.227 --> 36:38.802
Marcotto was in Las Vegas
the night that she was killed.

36:44.476 --> 36:45.405
Jackpot.

36:48.936 --> 36:50.595
Uh... bad time?

36:52.828 --> 36:53.732
Good time.

36:57.875 --> 36:58.661
Thank you.

37:00.025 --> 37:01.624
Okay, well, long story short:

37:02.760 --> 37:06.758
We have reason to believe that
Albert Marcotto was in a casino in Las Vegas

37:07.541 --> 37:09.388
the night that Julie Paxon was murdered.

37:10.663 --> 37:15.072
So the District Attorney's office
was wondering about the possibility of

37:16.145 --> 37:19.408
you retesting the DNA that
you found under her fingernails.

37:20.726 --> 37:22.157
I'm sorry, to what end?

37:23.459 --> 37:26.391
Well, clearly, Marcotto couldn't
have been in two places at once.

37:27.227 --> 37:31.592
So if we can verify that he was in Nevada
the night that Julie Paxon was killed,

37:32.460 --> 37:36.483
then we have to assume that the DNA
results were a function of some kind of...

37:38.943 --> 37:39.879
error.

37:41.183 --> 37:42.135
Error?

37:42.278 --> 37:42.878
I don't know.

37:42.763 --> 37:45.314
Maybe someone
accidentally mislabeled the samples.

37:45.365 --> 37:48.491
Or maybe it was contaminated by
a sample from one of the other victims.

37:49.076 --> 37:49.713
No.

37:50.038 --> 37:51.224
That's simply not possible.

37:51.967 --> 37:54.729
I'm the only one who
had access to Ms. Paxon's remains.

37:54.780 --> 37:55.889
And I can assure you,

37:56.269 --> 37:58.963
they were handled
with the utmost regard for limiting

37:59.014 --> 38:02.722
the possibility of molecular degradation
or cellular contamination.

38:03.151 --> 38:06.928
But if the District Attorney
wants us to run them again,

38:07.121 --> 38:08.089
I'll run them again.

38:15.887 --> 38:17.989
The M.E.'s giving him
the once-over as we speak.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.624
She thinks he had
a coronary sometime last night.

38:31.460 --> 38:34.277
M.E. is another way
of saying medical examiner, right?

38:34.643 --> 38:35.601
Right you are.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.971
The thing is,
we don't want to retest the old DNA.

38:40.292 --> 38:43.032
We want to get a new sample
from under Julie's fingernails.

38:44.046 --> 38:44.934
Okay.

38:47.289 --> 38:49.408
And we're gonna request
that someone else do it.

38:57.747 --> 38:59.040
Are you married?

39:00.184 --> 39:00.968
Yes.

39:01.750 --> 39:02.785
Yes, I am.

39:04.061 --> 39:05.053
Me, too.

39:07.955 --> 39:09.903
19 years, if you can believe it.

39:13.853 --> 39:16.068
Has your husband ever been unfaithful?

39:18.194 --> 39:19.166
No.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.657
They say the death of a loved one...

39:28.042 --> 39:30.551
is the most painful loss
any of us will ever know.

39:34.949 --> 39:36.274
But they would be wrong.

39:40.102 --> 39:43.774
Knowing they're gone
because they chose to be gone,

39:46.574 --> 39:51.738
knowing they're alive and well
and much happier with someone else...

39:56.295 --> 39:58.177
...that's what hurts the most.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.052
He was gonna leave me for...

40:05.817 --> 40:07.106
Julie Paxon.

40:09.745 --> 40:11.405
After 19 years.

40:14.437 --> 40:16.793
I went to see her at her house...

40:19.130 --> 40:22.368
to ask her to respect
what my husband and I had together;

40:22.419 --> 40:23.715
to remind her...

40:26.035 --> 40:27.583
that we were a family.

40:31.810 --> 40:34.167
She thought that was a very funny...

40:37.006 --> 40:39.727
a very old-fashioned idea.

40:44.128 --> 40:48.627
You'd be surprised
how hard it was cutting her that way...

40:52.779 --> 40:54.764
...even for someone in my line of work.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.517
So what do we do now?

41:05.548 --> 41:07.189
She didn't even ask for an attorney.

41:08.320 --> 41:11.252
Just walked right into his office
and said she wanted to confess everything.

41:12.236 --> 41:15.121
Guess she figured it was just
a matter of time before we could prove that

41:15.172 --> 41:17.035
she tampered with the DNA evidence.

41:17.551 --> 41:18.706
No, I don't think that's it.

41:18.949 --> 41:22.340
I think it was killing her,
not just knowing that she'd done it,

41:22.391 --> 41:24.308
but knowing that
she'd gotten away with it.

41:26.009 --> 41:27.501
I think she feels relieved.

41:31.502 --> 41:34.585
Do you think Marcotto comprehends
that he might have done a good thing

41:34.636 --> 41:36.976
that he helped us catch a killer?

41:37.872 --> 41:39.095
I don't think Marcotto cares,

41:39.146 --> 41:40.114
not about that.

41:40.935 --> 41:42.852
This was about him, his ego,

41:42.903 --> 41:44.310
some sick sort of pride.

41:46.093 --> 41:46.954
Well, tell him thanks,

41:47.005 --> 41:47.780
just the same.

41:48.046 --> 41:49.002
You can tell him yourself,

41:49.053 --> 41:52.174
'cause I'm done giving out
visitor passes to my head.

41:52.680 --> 41:56.887
I really just want to go home
and spend some time with my family,

41:57.060 --> 41:58.385
spend some time with me.

42:03.132 --> 42:04.197
This is nice.

42:05.170 --> 42:06.038
This is good.

42:07.782 --> 42:09.586
Yeah, Mommy, this is good.

42:09.938 --> 42:11.157
I'm glad we're all together.

42:13.985 --> 42:18.090
Yeah, Mommy, we don't like
it when we're not all together.

42:20.157 --> 42:23.640
Mom? Mom?!

42:25.168 --> 42:28.836
