In the criminal justice system,

00:03.071 --> 00:04.305
sexually based offenses

00:04.338 --> 00:06.240
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.274 --> 00:09.243
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.277 --> 00:11.079
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.112 --> 00:12.413
are members of an elite squad

00:12.446 --> 00:14.282
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.315 --> 00:17.518
These are their stories.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.189
[heavy metal speed rock]

00:21.222 --> 00:25.093
*

00:25.126 --> 00:27.728
Oh, ho ho!
That was sick, bro.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.397
Dude,
you're such a wuss.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.365
Take your skirt off
and try it again, man.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.267
Oh, I racked myself
on that one.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.836
Ooh, just not
your night, huh?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.206
Maybe it is.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.375
C-note!

00:41.409 --> 00:42.410
Sweet.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.777
Now let's buy some beers.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.746
Yes, dude.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.281
Oh, my God,
they're everywhere.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.117
100...200...

00:49.150 --> 00:50.551
We can buy
so much beer.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.820
Oh, man.

00:54.788 --> 00:57.658
Dude, she's dead.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.729
Talk about putting your money
where your mouth is.

01:01.762 --> 01:02.730
How many bills?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.133
Five.
All hundreds.

01:05.133 --> 01:05.966
You ID her?

01:05.999 --> 01:08.836
Jane Doe.
No wallet or ID on her.

01:08.869 --> 01:09.703
Definitely raped.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.206
Panties torn,
bruising to the breasts.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.575
Condom lubricant
on the thighs.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.777
Hell of a lot of blood.
She stabbed?

01:16.810 --> 01:19.147
Just a head laceration.
Scalp wounds bleed heavily.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.249
So she choked
on the money.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.750
I think she died
of heart failure.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.219
Found these pills
in her pocket--digoxin.

01:25.253 --> 01:29.190
He scared her to death
by raping her.

01:29.223 --> 01:31.359
He's going
for felony murder.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.860
Probably a prostitute,

01:32.893 --> 01:34.762
but what's with the money
in the mouth thing?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.230
I've never seen that
before.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.699
Maybe it's the perp's
twisted way of paying her.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.800
Detectives!

01:39.833 --> 01:42.170
You got something?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.772
Footwear impression
in blood.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.174
Not a full shoe print,

01:46.207 --> 01:47.608
but a distinctive
waffle-tread pattern.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.809
(Benson)
One of the skateboarders?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.311
Nah, their sneakers
are flat-soled.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.180
This is more like
a rubber-soled slip-on.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.781
Think you could
track the blood?

01:53.814 --> 01:54.915
Way ahead of you.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.417
Already called for K-9.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.254
[whimpers and barks]

02:00.288 --> 02:01.889
Good boy, Barnaby.

02:01.922 --> 02:05.193
Perp lives here, I'm pinning
my shield on the pooch.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.296
Open up!
Police!

02:08.329 --> 02:10.498
[latch turning]

02:10.531 --> 02:12.800
What the hell
do you want?!

02:12.833 --> 02:13.867
Is there anybody inside?

02:13.901 --> 02:16.204
How is that
your business?
Answer the question.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.405
I'm alone.
(Fin)
All clear.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.340
Check this out.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.442
There's dried blood
on the sole.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.943
Hey, that's my purse!

02:22.976 --> 02:24.312
That your money too?

02:24.345 --> 02:25.913
I found it.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.815
You robbed a corpse.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.650
She was dead, there was nothing
I could do to help her.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.219
So you helped yourself
to the money?

02:31.219 --> 02:33.354
She couldn't
take it with her.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.788
Neither can you.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.608
This makes exactly
$5,000, all in hundreds.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.009
Any prints?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.279
Just your skate punks
and little Miss Grave Robber.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.746
Captain doesn't want the press
to know about the cash.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.615
You run the signature
through VICAP?

03:34.648 --> 03:35.616
No matches.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.319
We're thinking that our victim
is a prostitute.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.653
Munch and Fin are canvassing
the working girls.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.589
Ask if any of them
use this brand.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.023
Condom wrapper
stuck to one of the bills.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.725
The victim's prints
are on it.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.694
Took the condom with him.
Smart rapist.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.597
I don't think
there was a rapist.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.900
This could be
consensual sex gone bad.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.736
How'd you get that
off the wrapper?

03:55.769 --> 03:56.770
It's from The Box.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.606
It's a sex club
run by women.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.774
Come again?

04:00.808 --> 04:01.909
Well, that's the idea.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.778
It's a party where women
live out their sexual fantasies.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.614
This place is three blocks
from the crime scene.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.881
Thanks.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.785
(Benson)
So what exactly do you offer?

04:11.819 --> 04:12.953
Oh, whatever you want.

04:12.986 --> 04:16.724
Strip tease, role play.
Girl-boy, girl-girl.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.725
No rules.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.727
But no sex acts
on premises.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.730
If you wanna hook up afterwards,
that's your business.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.732
Sounds great.
How do I join?

04:24.765 --> 04:26.834
Well, apply
with an erotic essay

04:26.867 --> 04:29.437
describing your sexual
interests, and a photo.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.904
You keep photos
of all your members?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.840
We destroy them
once you're accepted.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.708
We just want to ensure
applicants

04:34.742 --> 04:36.744
are height-weight
proportionate.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.547
And you definitely
pass that test.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.415
If you're worried
about privacy, don't be.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.016
Guest lists
use code names.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.785
All you have to show
is a membership card.

04:44.818 --> 04:45.853
And what about men?
Can they join?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.589
No, but members
can bring dates.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.923
If they're into guys.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.091
Ready to sign up?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.827
I don't think so.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.763
We're not doing
anything illegal.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.699
Ladies, I'm not here
to hassle you.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.568
This woman was murdered
last night

05:00.601 --> 05:01.635
a couple of blocks
from here.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.471
Do either one of you
recognize her?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.373
Didn't a girl complain

05:05.373 --> 05:07.040
that some guy
got rough with her?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.843
Our bouncer threw him out.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.746
He was a real sadist--
whipping this girl.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.548
She told him to stop,
and he didn't.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.416
You see this happen?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.618
Nope, but I got the word
to 86 the guy,

05:17.651 --> 05:18.719
so I escorted him
to the street.

05:18.752 --> 05:19.887
He go quietly?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.589
No, he didn't want to.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.657
He flashed a wad of cash
in my face.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.893
Hey, you can't bribe me.
I showed him the door.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.395
But he kept
hanging around outside.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.762
What for?
He said he was waiting

05:28.796 --> 05:30.598
for the woman
who brought him to the club.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.965
I told him to move on.
Did he?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.835
Not until I gave him
some encouragement.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.404
How much encouragement?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.071
I just roughed him up
a little.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.573
I checked his bag of tricks.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.509
The freak had cuffs, whips,
and a big-ass knife.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.876
What'd you do
with the toys?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.412
I gave 'em back.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.913
Even the knife?

05:45.946 --> 05:46.947
No way.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.081
Then he gave me
some sob story

05:48.115 --> 05:49.583
about needing it for work.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.752
Says he's a chef
at that restaurant, Soriello's.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.422
This is insane.

05:54.422 --> 05:57.725
I can't believe that little
bitch called the cops.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.560
It was just a game.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.561
What kind of game?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.663
A little
master-slave action.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.831
She was looking for it.

06:03.864 --> 06:04.765
She just
walked up to you

06:04.798 --> 06:06.567
and begged you
to beat the crap out of her?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.669
Yeah, with a leash
around her neck.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.839
She said she wanted to play,
she got sassy,

06:11.872 --> 06:14.608
so I lashed her
with my crop.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.976
She flips out,

06:16.009 --> 06:18.712
had that security goon
beat me up.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.548
I don't get off
on being hurt.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.583
Oh, so you can dish it out,
but you can't take it?

06:22.616 --> 06:23.984
So you hung around
for a little payback.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.754
No, I went home
and put ice on my face.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.855
Were you alone?

06:27.888 --> 06:29.790
Yes.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.792
Once Lola calms down,
she'll drop the charges.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.628
And after a couple
of more months in the scene,

06:34.662 --> 06:36.730
when her sexuality's
more evolved,

06:36.764 --> 06:38.832
she'll be
ready for me.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.568
This your Lola?

06:40.601 --> 06:41.469
Whoa.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.505
I like it rough,
but not that rough.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.608
And that's not Lola.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.477
(Benson)
All right. Thanks.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.944
I checked with The Box.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.880
Five women use "Lola"
as a code name.

06:52.913 --> 06:53.847
Any of them
African-American?

06:53.881 --> 06:54.848
One.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.083
Her real name
is Sarah Miller.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.217
She's an ad exec.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.819
Fin's checking
on her whereabouts now.

06:58.852 --> 06:59.987
He's wasting his time.
[cell phone ringing]

07:00.020 --> 07:02.590
Sarah Miller
is on a slab in the morgue.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.958
Benson.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.061
Thanks.

07:08.095 --> 07:08.962
That was Fin.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.898
Sarah Miller
never showed up for work.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.965
Never checked in.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.503
Right.
[engine starts]

07:18.005 --> 07:20.808
[knocking on door]

07:20.841 --> 07:22.743
Not at home or at work.
You satisfied?

07:22.776 --> 07:24.578
I'll find the super,
get him to let us in.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.246
(woman)
Who is it?
Who's there?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.116
Police.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.652
Sarah Miller?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.525
Yes?

07:40.027 --> 07:42.963
I've taken six showers
since last night.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.937
I was so upset,
I couldn't even call in sick.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.972
I didn't know
what to say.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.009
So I stayed home.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.715
You think that man
who attacked me

08:01.749 --> 08:02.683
killed a woman?

08:02.716 --> 08:05.953
Well...can you tell us
what he did to you?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.993
We were flirting.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.964
And then he got rough.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.704
He grabbed me.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.239
Forced me on my knees.

08:28.876 --> 08:32.112
[voice breaking]
He pushed his crotch
in my face.

08:35.248 --> 08:39.019
And when I started
to leave...

08:39.052 --> 08:41.188
he started whipping me.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.995
Do you remember seeing him

08:48.028 --> 08:50.664
with any other women
at the party?

08:50.698 --> 08:52.232
After it happened,

08:52.265 --> 08:54.868
I hid in the bathroom.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.136
Until a friend of mine

08:56.169 --> 08:57.871
told me he was gone.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.110
But earlier I saw him
coming on to a couple girls.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.749
Could she have been
one of those girls?

09:10.851 --> 09:12.219
I know her.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.825
She kept me company
in the ladies' room.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.694
She say if he bothered her?

09:20.728 --> 09:23.063
You've got it wrong.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.633
She's the bathroom attendant.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.309
(man)
It's Marguerite.

09:36.343 --> 09:40.147
My daughter.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.250
Ma petite fille.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.288
When she didn't come home,

09:48.321 --> 09:51.659
I thought she went straight
to her second job.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
Where is that?

09:54.161 --> 09:56.296
An office building
on Broadway.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.732
She was a cleaner.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.300
Eight years...

10:00.333 --> 10:02.870
and never missed a day.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.140
Did she suffer?

10:07.174 --> 10:09.309
She had a massive
heart attack.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.311
It would have been
very quick.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.247
Her heart
was always weak.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.017
She had rheumatic fever.

10:17.050 --> 10:20.153
But the doctor said
if she took her pills...

10:20.187 --> 10:21.955
[sobbing]

10:24.892 --> 10:26.093
Marguerite.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.360
We'll take you home.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.073
Monsieur Beauclair.

10:40.107 --> 10:44.011
Your wife called me.
I am so sorry.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.178
Thank you.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.283
I guess it took a murder
to finally

10:50.317 --> 10:52.319
get your attention, huh?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.154
And you are?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.322
I'm Mildred Quintana.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.691
I run the New Americans
Justice Center.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.959
And I think it's a travesty

10:58.992 --> 11:02.062
the police department doesn't
care about undocumented women!

11:02.095 --> 11:03.463
Ms. Quintana,
you got it backwards.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.332
We don't care what
a victim's legal status is.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.199
Oh, really?

11:06.233 --> 11:08.468
Then why is that sick
son of a bitch

11:08.501 --> 11:10.738
still raping women
in my community?!

11:10.738 --> 11:12.139
What makes you think
that all these women

11:12.172 --> 11:13.406
were attacked
by the same man?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.744
Well, you found money
on the body, didn't you?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.817
He's attacked 16 women
in the last three years.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.352
And those are just
the ones I know about.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.955
All of them
undocumented cleaning women

11:27.988 --> 11:29.422
raped on their way home
from work.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.424
So why didn't you
come to us?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.761
Well, I tried.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.495
I went to my precinct.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.497
I told them women
were being attacked.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.467
I even gave them
a description of the rapist.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.202
Do you know
what they said?

11:42.235 --> 11:44.772
That their hands were tied
without a victim.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.907
We can't do anything
without a complainant, either.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.408
Is there anyone who's
willing to step forward?

11:48.441 --> 11:49.609
No, no, they're terrified.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.046
These women would rather suffer
than risk being deported.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.782
Well, staying silent

11:54.782 --> 11:55.548
isn't gonna make him stop.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.317
Let us talk to them
and explain

11:57.350 --> 11:59.152
that the police are different
from Immigration.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.054
No, no,
this is not going to work.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.191
These women come from a place
where the police are corrupt,

12:04.224 --> 12:05.525
justice is for sale,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.828
and no one gives a damn
about poor people.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.130
They are not
going to trust you.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.298
Then he'll
keep attacking them,

12:11.331 --> 12:13.801
because he knows
they won't say anything.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.369
Look, you came to us.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.838
Do you want us to help you?

12:17.871 --> 12:19.807
We need their names.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.412
[knocking on door]

12:25.445 --> 12:27.180
Hi.
Yolanda Martinez?

12:27.214 --> 12:28.548
Never heard of her.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.250
Please, it's very important.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.919
I don't know Yolanda.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.553
Yes, my name
is Amina Asante,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.889
but I am quite sure I have never
been a victim of a crime.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.425
Yes, but I'd still
like to talk to you--
Sorry.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.459
Go away.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.829
[speaking native language]

12:43.831 --> 12:44.832
Please go.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.333
Ms. Zergin, it's important.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.836
Mildred Quintana sent me.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.339
She told you?

12:52.372 --> 12:56.443
Yes, because she knows
that I can help you.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.082
Come in.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.488
I wasn't going
to tell anyone.

13:08.521 --> 13:11.324
But it hurts so much
to keep it inside.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.593
It'll get better
if you go to counseling.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.962
I can't!

13:14.995 --> 13:17.497
If anyone finds out,
I'll be an outcast.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.268
In my religion, a woman must
be a virgin when she marries.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.335
You're Muslim?

13:22.369 --> 13:24.304
From Bosnia.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.906
Do you have any family here?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.141
My brother Milan.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.878
Oh, you have to go
before he comes home.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.512
He's become
very traditional.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.883
Nina...I promise your brother's
not gonna find out.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.218
But I need for you
to tell me what happened.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.021
I can't.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.191
He's raped
a lot of women, Nina.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.495
The one who he attacked
last night...died.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.166
Please help me
stop him.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.013
I work nights.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.216
Cleaning offices.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.919
I was on my way home,

14:11.919 --> 14:14.922
coming up from the subway.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.657
He dragged me
into an alley.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.359
Raped me.

14:19.392 --> 14:22.295
Did you see his face?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.933
I'll never forget it.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.605
The way he looked at me
afterwards.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.042
He smiled.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.277
Said, "Thank you."

14:37.310 --> 14:40.613
Then he handed me cash,
like I was a prostitute.

14:44.351 --> 14:48.155
It was more money
than I make in six months.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.257
I lay there
in that filthy alley,

14:50.290 --> 14:54.561
thinking at least
I could pay the rent.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.362
Nina...

14:55.395 --> 14:58.031
you have nothing
to be ashamed of.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.700
Then why do I feel
so dirty?!

15:00.733 --> 15:03.636
Every day, I think
I should burn the money.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.573
Do you still have it?

15:06.606 --> 15:10.410
I couldn't spend it.

15:10.443 --> 15:14.014
Please...
get it out of here.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.050
Hold on,
I'll get it.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.455
[keys rattling in door]

15:22.489 --> 15:24.457
That's my brother Milan.
He's early.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.327
Nina!
[speaking native language]

15:30.297 --> 15:31.999
Who are you?

15:31.999 --> 15:33.333
Police.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.036
I'm looking for witnesses
to a hit-and-run last night.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.707
I didn't see anything.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.110
That's what
I just told her.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.744
Sorry.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.080
Thank you for your help.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.622
(O'Halloran)
These bills have never
been in circulation,

15:55.655 --> 15:58.325
so I should be able
to lift some great prints.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.693
Spray on a little
ninhydrin.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.733
Steam accelerates
the reaction.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.539
I got your prints.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.507
Lot of smudges.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.343
(O'Halloran)
And three good ones.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.080
[computer beeping]

16:20.113 --> 16:21.514
All right, the first print's
unidentified.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.749
Probably your victim's.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.251
And two hits.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.552
Who have we got?

16:28.121 --> 16:29.589
No, wait.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.658
He's a bonded employee
at the Manhattan Bank of Trust.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.060
Probably a teller.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.494
Anyway,
who's the other one?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.529
Jason Whitaker.
Criminal record?

16:36.563 --> 16:40.100
No, he was fingerprinted
by the Bar Association.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.605
(man)
Come on, come on, come on.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.607
Somebody bet into my set,
please.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.409
Yes!

16:49.442 --> 16:53.080
Ohh!
Oh, nice suck-out, ass wipe.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.414
(Stabler)
Excuse me?

16:54.447 --> 16:55.515
Oh, online poker.

16:55.548 --> 16:56.816
Idiot chased
an inside straight draw,

16:56.849 --> 16:58.785
and he hit it on the river.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.553
You have me
at a disadvantage.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.256
Detective Stabler.
My partner Detective Benson.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.094
What can I do
for the NYPD?

17:07.094 --> 17:08.461
Tell us
where you were last night.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.597
Nowhere exciting,
that's for sure.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.332
What are you guys
investigating?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.301
Rape-homicide.

17:14.334 --> 17:18.738
Well, uh...
how did my name come up?

17:18.771 --> 17:19.739
(Stabler)
Fingerprint hit.

17:19.772 --> 17:20.840
Well, on what, exactly?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.809
Money.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.478
Well, the way I gamble,
my prints are on a lot of dough.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.580
But I'll hit a streak soon.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.216
Back to the question.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.250
Last night.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.853
I'm afraid
I can't answer that.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.123
Well, it is your fingerprints
on that money.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.359
Why don't you explain it to us,
or we'll bring you in.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.429
You can't.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.466
I have nothing more
to say.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.172
So you think
Jason Whitaker's your perp?

17:52.205 --> 17:54.874
My gut says no, but, uh,
he got pretty rattled

17:54.907 --> 17:57.144
when I told him
his prints were on the money.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.378
Rattled how?

17:58.411 --> 17:59.879
He said he couldn't
talk about it.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.215
Well, it sounds like he's
protecting one of his clients.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.884
No, Whitaker's prints...

18:04.917 --> 18:06.719
were on the money,

18:06.753 --> 18:08.155
because he gave it
to our rapist.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.222
Yeah, he tries
to clear himself,

18:09.256 --> 18:10.523
he's pointing the finger
at his client.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.658
He can't do that.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.160
Can you get a client list?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.162
Yeah. You know what firm
Jason Whitaker works for?

18:15.195 --> 18:17.897
Uh, yeah--Granger,
McCullum, and Kerstetter.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.267
As in Lionel Granger?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.501
Hmm.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.405
Hey, Lionel.
Have you got a sec?

18:25.438 --> 18:26.539
What's up?

18:26.573 --> 18:29.176
Well, I was just wondering
about one of your associates,

18:29.209 --> 18:30.277
Jason Whitaker.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.544
Wondering if
he's available?

18:34.181 --> 18:35.548
You've got good taste,
Casey.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.916
Between you and me,
he'll make partner this year.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.519
He's corporate, right?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.221
Trusts and estates--
well, just one estate.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.689
The Duvall family.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.293
As in Clay Duvall
of the ball bearing fortune?

18:46.326 --> 18:48.695
Eleanor Duvall
took quite a shine to Jason.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.364
You know, I've seen her on some
of the best-dressed lists.

18:51.398 --> 18:52.932
She spends
a lot on clothes.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.268
But she gives even more
of her wealth away.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.205
Might as well--
family's dying out.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.472
No kids?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.774
Just one son--Gabriel.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.476
Probably leave it all
to his cats.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.777
He's that eccentric?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.479
He can discuss
quantum theory,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.215
but he can't
balance his checkbook.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.850
It's a good thing mom's there
to bail him out.

19:15.255 --> 19:19.492
[clock chiming]

19:19.526 --> 19:22.229
(woman)
The portrait was
my mother-in-law's idea.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.465
She gave it to my husband
as a wedding present.

19:25.498 --> 19:26.699
I'm Eleanor Duvall.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.468
Nice to meet you.
Detective Elliot Stabler.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.337
What can I do for you?

19:30.370 --> 19:31.971
Actually,
I'm looking for your son.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.806
Gabriel?
Mm-hmm.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.875
Oh, he hasn't lived here
in years.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.244
Huh.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.312
This address
is on his driver's license.

19:39.346 --> 19:43.250
Oh, he never remembers
to update those things.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.617
Unfortunately,
he never remembers

19:44.651 --> 19:46.286
to pay his parking tickets,
either.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.153
Well, I'm not surprised.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.323
Gabriel has
all the money he needs.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.326
And he never remembers
to pay the bills.

19:53.360 --> 19:58.298
His head is in the clouds
or on those computers.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.932
I'll write you a check.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.301
Mrs. Duvall.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.935
Mrs. Duvall?

20:02.969 --> 20:04.404
I'm sorry,
he's gonna have to come down

20:04.437 --> 20:05.805
and deal with it
in person.

20:05.838 --> 20:06.973
Yes, of course.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.242
I'll give you his address.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.845
I paid those tickets.
I know I did.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.282
The canceled checks
must be here somewhere.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.984
I should have scanned them
onto my hard drive.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.386
You're a computer guy?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.488
Ah, I freelance.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.991
But this is my real work:
teaching computers how to see.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.293
See what?
Visual data.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.662
To process it
the same way humans do--

20:29.696 --> 20:31.030
through optical clues.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.500
The algorithms
are complex.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.335
Very hard to create,
some people say impossible.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.503
But I'll do it.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.570
The canceled checks
are here somewhere.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.871
I just can't
seem to find them.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.940
We can sort this all out
down at the precinct.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.343
I only have two hours,
and then I have to get back.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.778
Oh, not a problem.
It'll take 15 minutes.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.347
I have to be back by 8:00.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.448
No problem.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.384
Your coat?

20:51.418 --> 20:52.419
That's right, my coat.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.424
Liv, I've got him.
Go get Nina.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.331
Is Nina home?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.332
Are you joking?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.367
I saw you arrest her
two hours ago!

21:07.400 --> 21:08.835
What?

21:08.868 --> 21:11.371
The police,
coming home from work.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.906
I saw two cops with guns
put her in a car!

21:13.940 --> 21:16.075
Did they say
where they were taking her?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.944
Why are you
asking me?

21:17.977 --> 21:21.047
You're the one who did this.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.350
We never had any problems
until you showed up.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.352
We didn't take your sister.

21:25.385 --> 21:28.588
Then who did?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.428
The neighbors confirm
the brother's story.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.697
Two cops took Nina away.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.399
But there's no arrest
in the system,

21:39.432 --> 21:40.500
no outstanding warrants.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.534
Munch and Fin
talked to her boss.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.403
He said Nina didn't show up
for work tonight.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.405
So what are we dealing with?
Impersonators, feds?

21:45.438 --> 21:48.007
I talked to the FBI.
They don't have her.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.410
How much longer
can we keep Duvall?

21:50.443 --> 21:52.011
We're running out
of reasons to hold him,

21:52.044 --> 21:54.414
and Elliot's running
out of patience.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.548
He's some kind
of oddball genius.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.717
Won't shut up
about computers.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.686
Once we let him go, we're
never gonna get him back here

21:59.719 --> 22:00.887
without his lawyer.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.489
Is that him?

22:02.522 --> 22:05.992
Is that
why Nina disappeared?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.395
Did you tell him
who she is?

22:08.428 --> 22:09.662
Ms. Quintana, we really
can't discuss it.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.464
Hey,
I'm not stupid.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.733
You have a suspect.
Nina is gone.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.569
Something terrible
has happened to her.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.406
I should never
have given you their names.

22:19.439 --> 22:23.510
We'll find Nina,
and we'll arrest the rapist.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.144
I have to go.
I'm late for dinner.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.846
Got a date?
And I'm hungry.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.481
I can't disrupt
my eating schedule.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.716
I get hypoglycemic

22:29.749 --> 22:31.584
and use up the glycogen
stored in my liver.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.453
If I don't have glucose,
my blood sugar plummets.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.954
I'll get you
something to eat.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.056
What?
What do you want?

22:37.089 --> 22:38.425
Burger, sandwich?

22:38.425 --> 22:39.926
No, it's Thursday.
Meatloaf night.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.628
The Ganesford Diner
Blue Plate Special

22:41.661 --> 22:42.929
is meatloaf,
mashed potato,

22:42.962 --> 22:44.531
mushroom gravy,
and green beans.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.165
But I don't eat the green beans.
I don't like green.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.199
Well, I'll tell you what.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.935
I'll have my paperwork done
in a few minutes.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.803
You have plenty of time
for your meatloaf.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.439
No, they run out.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.540
I have to go now.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.107
I can't disrupt
my eating schedule.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.108
My mentation
will be affected,

22:56.142 --> 22:58.578
and my research requires
absolute concentration.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.646
Give me a few minutes.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.448
Meantime, you want
a cup of coffee,

23:01.481 --> 23:02.515
maybe a can of soda?

23:02.549 --> 23:03.750
I don't want anything.
I have to go.

23:03.783 --> 23:04.884
That's my boy.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.453
See, Gabriel's too smart
for your tricks.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.455
He's not gonna leave
his DNA on a soda can.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.522
Come on, let's go.
Just being polite.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.492
Oh, no, yeah, this is just
about parking tickets.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.093
Next time you want
to talk to my client,

23:14.126 --> 23:15.662
well, you call me first.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.531
I can't get a cab.
I lost my wallet.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.632
Can you take me home?
Sure, sure.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.601
But you can drop me off
at the diner,

23:21.634 --> 23:22.569
have some meatloaf with me.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.637
It's, uh, very good.
They make it with pork...

23:24.671 --> 23:25.638
Is that him?

23:25.672 --> 23:26.773
Let's go
back inside.

23:26.806 --> 23:27.940
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.976
Are you talking
about food?!

23:30.009 --> 23:31.711
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

23:31.744 --> 23:33.480
Who is that woman?
Why is she shouting at me?

23:33.480 --> 23:35.815
Do I know her?
I'd remember if--

23:35.848 --> 23:37.517
The police may be
through with you,

23:37.550 --> 23:38.551
but I am just
getting started.

23:38.585 --> 23:39.986
(Stabler)
Stay out of this.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.521
You're gonna pay
for what you've done!

23:41.554 --> 23:43.055
Come near my client again,
I'll have you arrested

23:43.089 --> 23:44.156
for harassment.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.559
Oh, do I look
scared to you, huh?

23:46.593 --> 23:47.927
You're out of your league!

23:47.960 --> 23:50.863
Why don't you just stick
with your wetback washer women?

23:50.897 --> 23:52.765
Okay, I'm gonna
take the stairs.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.534
You tell me
when you find Nina.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.968
Did you tell Whitaker

23:56.002 --> 23:58.004
that Nina's
an undocumented janitor?

23:58.037 --> 24:00.540
No.
Then why did he mention
wetback washer women?

24:00.573 --> 24:03.576
Because someone's been
leaking information to Whitaker

24:03.610 --> 24:04.677
about our case.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.746
They checked our files,
sold Nina out.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.515
It could be
anyone in this precinct.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.882
In the department,
for that matter.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.751
I figured out
where Nina is.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.088
[buzzer]

24:21.894 --> 24:23.696
Nina.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.934
Why did you turn me in
to Immigration?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.035
I didn't.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.005
They're deporting me
back to Bosnia.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.742
My parents
were killed in the war.

24:35.775 --> 24:37.544
My home destroyed.
I have nothing there!

24:37.577 --> 24:38.611
You did this.

24:38.645 --> 24:39.546
It wasn't me.

24:39.579 --> 24:42.014
Oh, I don't believe you.
Who else could have?

24:42.048 --> 24:44.250
It was the rapist.
Nina, listen to me.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.285
We have a suspect.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.689
We were about to have you
make an identification.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.158
Don't stop trusting me now.

24:56.796 --> 24:59.732
Please get me out of here.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.668
Nina Zergin applied
for political asylum

25:01.701 --> 25:03.703
three years ago,
but her claim was denied.

25:03.736 --> 25:05.905
We were about to deport her
when she disappeared.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.607
You left her alone
for three years.

25:07.640 --> 25:08.641
Why pick her up now?

25:08.675 --> 25:09.576
We received information

25:09.576 --> 25:11.611
linking her to a radical
Islamist cell.

25:11.644 --> 25:12.912
From where?

25:12.945 --> 25:14.781
Anonymous tip
on our hotline.

25:14.814 --> 25:17.083
She's a cleaning woman,
not a terrorist.

25:17.116 --> 25:18.618
Your mystery caller--

25:18.651 --> 25:20.052
that's the defense attorney
of the man who raped her.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.688
Can you prove that?

25:21.721 --> 25:25.024
If I could, I'd charge him
with witness tampering.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.595
Nina still needs to be
debriefed by Homeland Security.

25:28.595 --> 25:31.197
When she comes up clean,
will you cut her loose?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.600
I can't.
The deportation order is legal.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.334
My--my hands are tied.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.769
The Violence Against Women Act

25:36.803 --> 25:38.671
has a provision granting
temporary asylum

25:38.705 --> 25:41.741
to victims of crime
who cooperate with prosecutors.

25:41.774 --> 25:45.978
You file that paperwork,
she's all yours.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.179
Am I really legal now?

25:47.213 --> 25:48.247
Temporarily.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.783
After the trial, I can
petition for permanent status.

25:50.817 --> 25:51.818
Thank you.

25:51.851 --> 25:55.154
Your help is all
the thanks I need.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.827
Did you tell Milan
I was raped?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.629
No...but you should.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.901
[speaking native language]

26:10.770 --> 26:11.838
Who is this?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.105
This is A.D.A. Novak.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.907
She's a lawyer
that works with us.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.244
You freed Nina?

26:18.277 --> 26:19.345
It was nothing.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.980
She never should have
been locked up.

26:21.013 --> 26:22.048
Thank you.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.049
Ride back to the office?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.217
(Novak)
No, take them home.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.920
I got a stop to make.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.159
Casey.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.694
My boss said
you were interested.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.295
Well, you don't
waste any time.

26:36.328 --> 26:37.997
Neither do you.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.832
Please, sit down.
What can I do for you?

26:39.866 --> 26:42.702
Bring in Gabriel Duvall
for a line-up.

26:42.735 --> 26:44.804
Who's looking at him?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.806
The rape victim
you were about to have

26:46.839 --> 26:47.940
conveniently deported.

26:47.974 --> 26:51.844
I got her status legalized,
so she's not going anywhere.

26:58.885 --> 27:00.853
Where are we going tonight?

27:00.887 --> 27:02.689
A little dinner?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.825
Special Victims.

27:05.858 --> 27:08.828
I made you a reservation.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.717
I don't know.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.353
Just take your time.

27:58.945 --> 28:02.014
Number two.

28:02.048 --> 28:05.084
He raped me.
I'm sure.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.957
We'll give you
some privacy.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.763
Good job.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.269
Looks like your boy's
going down.

28:23.302 --> 28:24.904
She'd say anything
to remain in this country.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.372
She picked my client
because he's wealthy

28:26.405 --> 28:27.874
and he's in
the society pages.
We have the money.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.809
My fingerprints on it,
not Gabriel Duvall's.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.277
What, you gonna charge me?
Come on, Casey, you got nothing.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.879
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Jason...

28:32.912 --> 28:34.346
They're gonna put me in jail.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.082
Can't you do something
to stop them?
Don't worry.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.950
You arrest my client now,
the judge will dismiss him

28:37.984 --> 28:39.318
in arraignments.
Mr. Whitaker.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.253
Mrs. Duvall, you shouldn't
have come down here.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.454
Everything's under control.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.589
Well, it doesn't look
under control to me.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.892
Mother, these detectives
think I've committed a crime.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.494
Well, Mr. Whitaker is going
to set everything straight.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.931
Gabriel will be coming home
with us, won't he?

28:53.332 --> 28:54.333
Let him go.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.269
Sweetheart,
are you all right?

28:57.303 --> 28:58.838
(Gabriel)
I think I have a cold.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.873
I don't know why.
I've been taking my vitamins.

29:00.907 --> 29:01.974
Even Echinacea.

29:02.008 --> 29:03.876
Well, this place
must be full of germs.

29:03.910 --> 29:04.877
I'll have Mrs. Bianco

29:04.911 --> 29:06.545
make you some of your favorite
chicken soup.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.214
[sniffles]

29:08.247 --> 29:10.016
Darling,
where are your manners?

29:10.049 --> 29:12.051
Use a handkerchief.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.823
[whispering]
Gabriel, that's disgusting!

29:16.823 --> 29:18.524
Throw it away!

29:18.557 --> 29:20.326
(Whitaker)
Here we go.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.165
That sucks.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.113
Maybe not.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.548
(Warner)
Present for me?

29:42.581 --> 29:46.118
(Stabler)
That snot could close
a dozen unsolved rape cases.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.487
There's more on this tissue
than Gabriel Duvall's mucus.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.858
Looks like mascara
and foundation.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.192
Marguerite Beauclair's
makeup

29:53.225 --> 29:54.526
was smeared
all over her face

29:54.560 --> 29:56.028
when her body was found.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.496
I'll type
the cosmetic brand.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.165
See if I can match it
to what Marguerite used.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.232
But I'll need extra time.

30:00.266 --> 30:04.536
You just get us what we need
to nail this bastard.

30:04.570 --> 30:05.571
If the tissue
links Gabriel Duvall

30:05.604 --> 30:06.605
to Marguerite's murder,

30:06.638 --> 30:07.874
the case won't go to trial.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.041
He'll plead out.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.043
Will Nina still get asylum
if she doesn't have to testify?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.544
Yeah, I'm pretty sure,
but I'll check with Immigration.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.080
[telephone rings]

30:14.113 --> 30:17.083
Novak, Sex Crimes.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.085
Yeah, send 'em up.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.320
Flowers.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.355
You holding out on me?

30:23.389 --> 30:24.523
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.925
If they're
from Jason Whitaker,

30:25.958 --> 30:27.393
they're going
straight in the trash.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.495
Hey, you feel
like a cup of coffee?

30:29.528 --> 30:31.063
Every second
of every day.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.064
Good, I'll go.

30:32.098 --> 30:33.099
Thanks.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.909
Yeah, Agent Tim Harriman,
please.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.043
Um, right.

30:44.076 --> 30:47.346
Could have him call Casey Novak
at the D.A.'s office?

30:47.379 --> 30:49.081
Thanks.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.523
[punch lands]

30:57.556 --> 30:58.557
Uhh!

31:00.392 --> 31:01.527
Uhh!

31:01.560 --> 31:02.661
Ohh!

31:02.694 --> 31:03.963
Ohh!

31:03.996 --> 31:05.932
Uhh!

31:07.366 --> 31:08.334
Unh!

31:08.367 --> 31:10.136
[grunting]

31:10.169 --> 31:12.004
Uhh!

31:16.976 --> 31:18.010
No.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.616
[glass shatters]

31:37.129 --> 31:39.131
Casey, I had to go
three blocks

31:39.165 --> 31:40.499
to find
an open coffee shop.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.202
If you went home,
I'm gonna kill ya.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.353
How's she doing?

32:01.387 --> 32:03.622
Head trauma.
She's still out.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.391
Did you see anything?

32:05.424 --> 32:07.659
Perp was gone
when I got there.

32:09.695 --> 32:12.364
D.A.'s office has
a lot of surveillance cameras.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.300
I'm on it.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.168
[knocking on door]

32:17.336 --> 32:20.306
What do you want?

32:20.339 --> 32:22.574
You can't come here.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.544
Let me see your hands.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.313
What's going on?
What do you want?

32:27.346 --> 32:28.314
Show me your hands.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.416
My lawyer said you're
not allowed to talk to me.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.384
You have to get out of here.
Now get out.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.586
You're a smart guy, right?

32:34.620 --> 32:37.123
Wear gloves?
Gloves?
I don't wear gloves.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.390
I don't like the way
my hands feel--

32:38.424 --> 32:40.259
Where were you tonight?

32:40.292 --> 32:42.528
You have to leave me alone,
or I'll call Jason!

32:42.561 --> 32:43.262
Good, call your lawyer.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.530
Call your mommy,
for all I care.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.199
They can't protect you
from me.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.469
I didn't do anything.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.304
Answer my question.
Where were you tonight?

32:52.338 --> 32:53.472
I just got back
from the diner.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.074
Roast chicken,
creamed corn, carrots.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.342
Shut up!

32:59.511 --> 33:02.448
You better pray
somebody saw you there.

33:12.491 --> 33:17.196
[door opens, closes]

33:18.497 --> 33:21.233
Hey.

33:21.267 --> 33:22.434
Olivia.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.535
Hey, don't get up.

33:23.569 --> 33:26.438
It's okay.
Don't move.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.208
What happened?

33:29.241 --> 33:31.077
You're in the hospital.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.512
You were attacked, Casey.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.515
You've got a concussion
and a couple of broken ribs.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.086
Who did this?

33:40.086 --> 33:41.687
I was hoping
that you could tell me.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.690
Didn't anyone see?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.625
There were
so many people there.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.195
Where?

33:49.228 --> 33:51.497
In the squad room.

33:55.634 --> 33:59.205
No, honey,
that was this afternoon.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.141
You were attacked at night,
after dinner, in your office.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.142
Remember?

34:03.175 --> 34:06.512
We were talking,
and I went to get coffee and--

34:06.545 --> 34:08.247
You don't remember?

34:10.582 --> 34:13.352
No.
No, it's all blank.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.620
It's okay, Casey.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.322
It's okay, it's just
gonna take a while

34:16.355 --> 34:18.590
for your memory
to come back.

34:20.826 --> 34:23.195
Did he ra--
did he rape me?

34:23.229 --> 34:24.363
No.

34:30.669 --> 34:32.571
Why can't I remember?

34:32.604 --> 34:34.740
You don't have to.

34:34.773 --> 34:37.176
We're gonna find this guy.

34:37.209 --> 34:39.245
Elliot's at your office
right now

34:39.278 --> 34:41.380
going through
surveillance tapes.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.415
Okay?

34:45.551 --> 34:46.818
(Salazar)
We got main camera,

34:46.852 --> 34:50.456
then we got cameras
by the elevator.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.590
Now, your partner said

34:51.623 --> 34:53.525
Novak got a call
from security

34:53.559 --> 34:54.726
about a flower delivery.

34:56.628 --> 34:59.265
(Stabler)
There he is.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.466
He signed in.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.833
You check the log?
Just scribble.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.269
Security guy describe him?

35:03.302 --> 35:04.470
Doesn't remember anyone.

35:04.503 --> 35:05.537
Prints?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.606
Guy never took
his gloves off.

35:12.878 --> 35:15.347
Come on, Gabriel,
show me your face.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.220
(Salazar)
That your guy?

35:38.970 --> 35:41.340
I'm from Sarajevo.

35:41.373 --> 35:44.210
I was tortured by
Karadzic's murder squads.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.212
I don't scare easily.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.448
Then doing
a hard 20 in Attica

35:49.481 --> 35:51.217
shouldn't be
a problem for you.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.721
Lock me up.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.657
You know,
it takes a real man

35:58.690 --> 36:00.592
to beat a woman
half to death.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.362
She got what she deserved.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.964
What, by trying
to help your sister?

36:05.997 --> 36:08.700
She made my sister
untouchable.

36:08.734 --> 36:09.968
She took away
her future.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.637
How'd she do that?

36:11.670 --> 36:13.672
Tell me how she did that.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.307
That lawyer forced her

36:15.341 --> 36:18.677
to relive her humiliation
in public.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.647
Now the world knows
she's no longer a virgin.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.649
Your sister was raped.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.953
She's gotta deal with it.
So do you.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.724
No man will ever have her.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.793
She shamed herself.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.595
And our family.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.464
So this is about you.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.401
I got our honor back.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.870
You got nothin' back.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.773
You have no idea
what honor is.

36:50.309 --> 36:53.445
You're no better
than the man who raped Nina.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.747
Unh!

36:55.781 --> 36:58.317
Beating that lawyer
wasn't enough!

36:58.350 --> 37:00.419
I should have
killed the bitch.

37:00.452 --> 37:03.389
My sister Nina
will never testify!

37:09.761 --> 37:12.898
Elliot, in my office.
Now.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.511
You barged into
my son's house

37:25.544 --> 37:26.812
in the middle of the night.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.580
You threatened him.

37:30.048 --> 37:31.850
I was investigating
an attack

37:31.883 --> 37:33.485
on an Assistant
District Attorney.

37:33.519 --> 37:36.522
Which he did not commit.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.723
I didn't know that
at the time.

37:37.756 --> 37:39.325
But you would have...

37:39.358 --> 37:41.827
if you had investigated.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.430
The captain tells me
that you have been a policeman

37:44.463 --> 37:46.365
for almost 20 years.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.699
That's commendable.

37:47.733 --> 37:48.800
Thank you.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.870
Do you like your job,
Detective?

37:53.905 --> 37:55.907
Yes, ma'am.

37:55.941 --> 37:59.778
Then I suggest
you stay away from my son.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.514
The police commissioner
is a friend.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.916
So is the mayor.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.454
Don't make me call them.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.761
Is there anything else,
Mrs. Duvall?

38:15.794 --> 38:19.398
I think an apology
is in order.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.801
I'm sorry.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.970
Not to me.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.905
To Gabriel.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.876
In light
of the circumstances,

38:30.909 --> 38:32.778
I think it would be
inappropriate

38:32.811 --> 38:34.446
for Detective Stabler
to have

38:34.480 --> 38:36.014
any further contact
with your son.

38:36.047 --> 38:38.517
But please tell him
that Detective Stabler

38:38.550 --> 38:41.019
is sorry for
the misunderstanding.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.421
Very well.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.722
Good night, Detective.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.890
Good night, ma'am.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.394
Captain--

38:48.394 --> 38:49.795
Save it.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.797
I probably would have thrown
Gabriel Duvall out the window.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.666
We may have a bigger
problem anyway.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.667
What?

38:55.701 --> 38:56.935
Nina Zergin.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.938
Her brother says
she doesn't want to testify.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.040
She backs out,
Gabriel walks.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.411
I'll talk to her.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.680
Let Novak do it.

39:08.714 --> 39:09.948
She's not back at work.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.083
I don't think she wants
anyone to see her yet.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.085
Exactly.

39:14.119 --> 39:15.821
[knocking]

39:20.826 --> 39:24.463
I can't speak to you.
I--I promised my brother.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.635
I know how hard it was for you
to tell me what happened.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.570
I know what it's done
to your family.

39:33.439 --> 39:36.041
But no matter what
you decide to do,

39:36.074 --> 39:37.876
nothing will stop me

39:37.909 --> 39:40.946
from prosecuting
the man who raped you.

39:43.949 --> 39:46.718
What do you
want me to do?

39:46.752 --> 39:48.920
Testify
in the grand jury.

39:48.954 --> 39:53.825
Once I get an indictment,
we can arrest Gabriel Duvall.

39:59.030 --> 40:01.467
Casey!
Casey, I'm so sorry.

40:01.467 --> 40:02.968
Oh, God,
I heard what happened.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.803
Why don't you save it
for someone who cares?

40:04.836 --> 40:05.904
Hey, no joke.
I'm serious.

40:05.937 --> 40:08.173
You are making me late.
I have grand jury time booked.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.675
Oh, I don't think
you'll be using it.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.544
Judge Trillin's ordering you
removed from the case.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.513
On what grounds?

40:14.546 --> 40:15.714
Uh, I want you...

40:15.747 --> 40:17.616
as a defense witness.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.559
(Branch)
Hell of a strategy.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.728
Nina lost her virginity,
was afraid of what

40:29.761 --> 40:32.464
her traditional Muslim brother
might do if he found out.

40:32.498 --> 40:34.032
So she lied
about being raped.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.901
Yeah, Whitaker wants to use
Milan's attack on me

40:35.934 --> 40:37.469
to bolster his case.

40:37.503 --> 40:38.904
He's violent,
therefore Nina's afraid,

40:38.937 --> 40:41.807
so she made up a story about
being raped by Gabriel Duvall.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.074
It's a compelling argument.

40:43.108 --> 40:46.011
I can win this motion.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.613
A--I'm up in front
of Judge Trillin,

40:47.646 --> 40:49.014
and he loves me;

40:49.047 --> 40:51.082
B--the way I look, I'm gonna
get the sympathy vote--

40:51.116 --> 40:52.183
Casey.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.052
I'm taking this case
away from you.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.023
You can't.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.791
Not after
what I've been through.

40:59.825 --> 41:03.061
No one wants to win this case
more than I do.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.763
Which is exactly
why you can't try it.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.598
Whitaker was right--
you're too emotionally involved.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.667
I've already
reassigned the case.

41:08.700 --> 41:09.868
To who?

41:09.901 --> 41:10.902
Tracey Kibre.

41:10.936 --> 41:13.038
She's a homicide A.D.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.272
She's not used
to live victims.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.007
Nina won't be able
to relate to her.

41:16.041 --> 41:18.544
Well, she'll have to,
'cause Tracey's putting Nina

41:18.544 --> 41:21.012
in the grand jury
tomorrow morning.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.553
Remember, there are
no surprises in the grand jury.

41:27.553 --> 41:29.054
You know what
I'm gonna ask you.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.590
So just answer my questions.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.992
Everything'll be just fine.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.827
Okay.
I'm ready.

41:35.861 --> 41:38.196
Good.
Hi, Nina.

41:38.229 --> 41:41.099
Ms. Novak,
I'm so glad to see you.

41:41.132 --> 41:44.135
I just wanted
to wish you luck.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.107
You're up.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.141
Okay.

41:54.580 --> 41:56.014
Casey.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.315
I thought you were
off the case.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.585
I am.

41:59.585 --> 42:01.019
You looking for Kibre?

42:01.052 --> 42:03.655
Yeah.

42:03.689 --> 42:04.723
Warner finished
the analysis

42:04.756 --> 42:06.291
on the tissue
from Gabriel's pocket.

42:06.324 --> 42:09.595
It had more on it than just
the dead girl's makeup.

42:09.595 --> 42:12.030
DNA from her blood?

42:13.732 --> 42:14.733
Her tears.

42:17.235 --> 42:20.171
Go collar
the son of a bitch.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.823
My mother relayed
your apology.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.025
Though I do appreciate
this personal delivery

42:40.058 --> 42:42.628
of the proverbial
olive branch.

42:42.661 --> 42:43.995
Would you care to join me?

42:44.029 --> 42:46.097
I recommend the pork chop,
but not the peas.

42:46.131 --> 42:48.166
Right, they're green.

42:48.199 --> 42:49.635
Stand up.

42:49.635 --> 42:51.136
I'm not done
with my dinner.

42:51.169 --> 42:52.203
You're done.

42:52.237 --> 42:55.907
I thought you were ordered
to stop this harassment.

42:55.941 --> 42:57.909
You're hurting me!

42:57.943 --> 42:59.177
You haven't begun
to see what hurt is.

42:59.210 --> 43:00.812
Gabriel Duvall,
you're under arrest

43:00.846 --> 43:02.247
for the rape
of Nina Zergin

43:02.280 --> 43:04.315
and for the rape-murder
of Marguerite Beauclair.

43:04.349 --> 43:06.084
You have the right
to remain silent.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.352
You give up that right,
anything you say

43:07.385 --> 43:10.388
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.124
You have the right
to an attorney...
