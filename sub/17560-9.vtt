00:02.085 --> 00:03.753
Okay, did you confirm
the wedding photography?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.088
- Check.
- The videographer?

00:05.171 --> 00:07.257
- Check.
- The stenographer?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.425
- Check.
- No!

00:08.508 --> 00:10.051
There is no stenographer
at a wedding!

00:10.135 --> 00:11.845
You failed the test!

00:14.556 --> 00:16.265
You failed.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.934
Okay, ladies..

00:18.017 --> 00:20.061
...we are 72 hours away
from my wedding.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.981
And so far, I'm not very
impressed with my bridal party.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.816
What is this?
You call this a wedding favor?

00:24.899 --> 00:26.443
I call this garbage!

00:26.526 --> 00:30.238
Hey, I thought you said
we get to eat the rejects.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.948
Okay, Val, relax!

00:32.031 --> 00:34.075
Your wedding
is gonna be perfect.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.535
You're right, you're right. Oh.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.287
It's just, y-you know,
you only get married once

00:37.370 --> 00:40.457
and I guess this whole thing's
just had me so stressed out.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.126
Really? You hide it so well!

00:43.209 --> 00:45.628
Val, we are in the home stretch.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.339
The caterer's all taken care of,
the flowers are all set.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.633
And you picked up
my wedding dress?

00:50.717 --> 00:53.219
Isn't it nice when sisters hug?

00:54.971 --> 00:57.140
- You didn't pick up my dress?
- I'm sorry!

00:57.223 --> 00:59.768
What about you?
You were hired as her backup!

00:59.851 --> 01:02.228
Isn't it nice
when best friends hug?

01:02.312 --> 01:04.980
Oh! What is wrong with you two?

01:05.063 --> 01:06.649
This is my bridal gown

01:06.733 --> 01:08.485
the center
of my wedding universe.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.113
It is the sun
without which all things die

01:12.197 --> 01:14.324
starting with you two!

01:14.407 --> 01:16.659
Okay, I left five messages
for your dressmaker.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.745
I'm sure that Gittle
will call you back!

01:18.828 --> 01:20.038
Yeah, I'm sure she just,
you know

01:20.121 --> 01:23.458
took a little vacation,
went out partying.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.960
A 95-year-old Russian immigrant?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.296
Well, they do like their <i> vodka.</i>

01:33.134 --> 01:34.803
Hi, uh, we're here
to see Gittle.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.805
Yeah?
She's in the living room.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.223
Come on, team.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.226
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.815

caught up with her.

aren't you holding the dress?

02:30.984 --> 02:32.193
Why aren't you
holding the dress?

02:32.277 --> 02:33.903
I searched all her closets
and her bedroom

02:33.987 --> 02:35.280
and all I found were housecoats

02:35.363 --> 02:37.949
and a poster of Jude Law.

Holly, I want my dress.

one-of-a-kind, strapless dress

She can't hold out
one more freaking week?

- Hey.
- Did you find it?

02:50.128 --> 02:52.213
Totally scored.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.757
I found these woozy pills
in her medicine cabinet.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.388
What? She's taken
the ultimate muscle relaxer.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.641
Okay, Val, don't worry.
I am your maid of honor.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.101
We're gonna
find your dress, okay?

03:05.184 --> 03:06.269
It's gotta be here somewhere.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.563
It's not like
she was buried in it.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.445
- No.
- She wouldn't.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.113
I'm going in.

Oh, Gittle, Gittle!

Gittle!

03:36.382 --> 03:37.550
Gone, just like that.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.845
I know. She was a great woman.

So thoughtful, so wise

03:42.847 --> 03:45.808
and not afraid
to try new things in bed.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.314
It's a shame how she went,
isn't it?

03:51.397 --> 03:52.815
Yeah.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.235
- How was that exactly?
- In her sleep.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.446
Oh, well,
at least it was peaceful.

03:58.529 --> 03:59.822
Not really.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.408
She was driving at the time.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.287
Alright, hey, listen,
I talked to the old guy.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.706
Yeah, that narrows it down.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.166
Well, it seems as though
the family took

04:10.249 --> 04:11.584
all the clothes in the apartment

04:11.668 --> 04:14.295
and donated them
to a thrift store in Queens.

- What now?
- Well, that was the florist.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.320
Um, they can't get you
your peach roses.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.532
- So how about yellow?
- How about no?

04:42.615 --> 04:45.034
My color scheme
is first harvest peach

04:45.118 --> 04:46.953

- Mint?
- No.

a new one.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.171
Okay, you and Lauren
go rip the florist a new one

04:57.255 --> 04:59.215
I'll grab the guys and we'll go
to that thrift shop in Queens.

there's a lot of old in here.

- I'm gonna miss the shrimp.
- 'Lauren!'

for a strapless, beaded bodice.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.429
You understand we only know
pretty or ugly.

05:46.512 --> 05:47.889
And when we're drunk,
either one is fine.

Don't laugh at that.

Hi, I am looking
for a wedding dress.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.822
You aren't gonna marry him,
are you?

06:04.906 --> 06:07.492
Because that would make me sad.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.787
Okay, she scares me a lot.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.288
Wedding dresses are over there.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.332
We've got
a lot of treasures in here.

06:14.415 --> 06:17.960
And just remember,
anything slightly used

06:18.044 --> 06:19.337
can be made beautiful again

06:19.420 --> 06:22.757
with a little spit and polish.

Maybe I should've brought
three puppies to help me

more concentration.

Come on,
we have to find the dress!

Now, you see, if more women
wore wedding dresses like this

07:01.254 --> 07:04.257
more men
would be marrying women.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.884

it's not here! Uh..

07:06.968 --> 07:08.177
Excuse me, miss.

wedding dress? It's a..

We need to speak to them.

this wedding since she was 10.

She has pictured the dress,
she's pictured the roses.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.189
Did she picture her <i> fiance</i>
with another woman?

08:02.315 --> 08:04.108

at the <i> pizza</i> place.

a perfectly good explanation

Queens to share a slice of <i> pizza</i>

two days before he gets married.

What could Rick be doing?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.732
Apparently, Julie.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.567
Is that helpful?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.487
- This is really gonna kill Val!
- Hey, Holly, calm down.

08:49.570 --> 08:50.738
For all you know, Rick told Val

08:50.821 --> 08:52.156
that he's having lunch
with Julie.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.783
And you might be able
to clear that up right now.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.119
- Look who's coming.
- Val, Lauren. Alright, move.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.704
Did you find my dress?
Do they have my dress?

- Where is it?
- Oh, oh, okay, funny story.

Uh, just know that's how
the florist started with her

09:02.375 --> 09:05.086
and he's still got an ice pack
on his groin, so..

09:06.254 --> 09:09.507
Okay, look.
They sold your dress.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.260
Oh, my God.
Ah, ooh, my back's tightening.

Don't stress.

You know what happens
when you stress.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.430
Yeah, well, apparently,
I'm stressing

'cause now it's spasming.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.892
Okay, don't spasm.
No need to spasm.

Hey, Lauren, you got
any more of those mints?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.480
No, no, no, my family
is flying in for the holidays

09:24.563 --> 09:26.565

to freshen my breath then.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.151

the address of the girl

and we're gonna go get it.

Hey, um, your back doesn't
seem to be getting any better.

09:36.826 --> 09:40.121
Maybe you should call Rick
and have him come pick you up.

09:40.204 --> 09:43.332
No, he can't. He's in New Jersey
all day on business.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.003
Is that what he told you,
New Jersey? That scum!

09:47.086 --> 09:48.337
What?

09:48.421 --> 09:51.507
There's just quite a bit of scum
in New Jersey.

Okay.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.472
I got the address.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.225
And now I feel dirty and cheap.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.149
Okay, stop! Look.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.651
Ben and I'll drop off
the check with the photographer.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.361
Gary and Vince
will pick up your dress.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.071
Lauren's gonna take you home
and you're gonna

10:14.155 --> 10:15.781
get your back massager
and actually use it

10:15.865 --> 10:17.241
on your back, okay?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.702
Everybody know what they have
to do? Ready, break!

10:19.785 --> 10:21.203
Ooh, on the way home,
can we stop

10:21.287 --> 10:22.538
at that <i> pizza</i> place
across the street?

10:22.621 --> 10:24.540
- No! No pizza place!
- Why not?

10:24.623 --> 10:26.876
Because, uh, I need to talk
to you about something.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.086
- Can't it wait?
- No, no, no, it can't wait.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.546
- See, um..
- What?

10:30.629 --> 10:33.674
Is it weird
if I look at other girls

10:33.758 --> 10:35.259
and have feelings?

10:35.343 --> 10:36.218
What?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.553
Rick and Julie
just got in a cab.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.221
Okay, you know what? It's over.

10:39.305 --> 10:42.141
That phase has passed. Let's go.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.934
Um, is it weird?

10:53.569 --> 10:56.614
- 24C. This is it.
- Alright, so how do we do this?

10:56.697 --> 10:58.240
We just ask
for the wedding dress back?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.576
Well, let me see,
in my all experience

11:00.659 --> 11:03.746
asking for wedding dresses back,
I don't know!

11:03.829 --> 11:05.748
You know don't worry.
I'll handle it, so..

11:05.831 --> 11:07.917
- Alright.
- Hm.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.418
[chuckles]

11:09.502 --> 11:11.670
- She's wearing it.
- I see.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.965
How are you doing?
Uh, I'm Vince.

11:15.049 --> 11:18.260
I, uh, uh.
Tell her why we're here, Gar.

11:22.056 --> 11:22.890
Hi.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.975
[chuckles]
Um..

11:25.059 --> 11:27.978
Oh, are we, are we
interrupting anything holy?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.397
Oh!

11:29.480 --> 11:31.690
No, I'm getting married
in a few days.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.484
My mother's
just hemming my dress.

11:33.567 --> 11:34.777
[chuckles]
Okay, well..

11:34.860 --> 11:36.612
You see, that's why we're here.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.448
Um, yeah, uh, about your dress

11:39.532 --> 11:41.700
now, uh..

11:41.784 --> 11:43.327
Tell her, Vince.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.080
Uh, see, the thing is

11:46.163 --> 11:47.832
it was accidentally donated

11:47.915 --> 11:49.542
to the store
where you bought it

11:49.625 --> 11:51.836
and we kinda need it back.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.337
(female #1)
'Who is it, Nikki?'

11:53.421 --> 11:56.924
It's about the dress, ma!
They want it back.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.179
Who wants what back?

12:02.263 --> 12:03.305
Wow, okay, um..

12:03.389 --> 12:05.808
[clears throat]

12:05.891 --> 12:07.852
Uh, see, this was
our friend Val's dress

12:07.935 --> 12:11.063
and through a series
of bad circumstances

12:11.147 --> 12:13.023
it ended up at a thrift store
where you--

12:13.107 --> 12:16.569
Paid good money for it
and it's ours.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.697
Go stir the sauce, Nikki.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.491
Uh, yeah,
but, but it was Val's first.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.827
And-and this dress,
it-it means everything to her.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.412
I mean, she's getting married
in a few days.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.456
Now, to be honest with you,
the woman hasn't had

12:28.539 --> 12:30.040
the best of luck with men.
I mean, the first one--

12:30.124 --> 12:32.001
Luck with men?

12:32.084 --> 12:35.337
My daughter used to weigh
230 pounds.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.089
I went all the way
to the Vatican

12:37.173 --> 12:39.508
to pray
she'd stop eating like a pig

12:39.592 --> 12:41.385
and find a husband.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.096
A week later she got in a fight
at the bowling alley

12:44.180 --> 12:46.223
and wound up
with her jaw wired shut.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.350
Thank God!

12:48.434 --> 12:51.479
And 75 pounds later,
she met her <i> fiance.</i>

12:51.562 --> 12:52.771
It was a miracle

12:52.855 --> 12:55.024
as was finding this dress.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.859
So you see..

12:56.942 --> 12:59.028
...I ain't giving it up.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.621
[chuckles]

13:08.704 --> 13:10.247
Listen, you look like

13:10.331 --> 13:13.876
a reasonable, moderately
attractive woman

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
and, uh..

13:18.923 --> 13:21.467
Well, looks like Popeye
lost his pretty.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.433
[instrumental music]

13:32.311 --> 13:34.146
Okay, I'm just gonna ask you
one last time.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.357
Are you sure you wanna tell
Val about Rick and Julie?

13:36.440 --> 13:37.483
Well, she deserves to know.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.361
She's marrying him
in three days..

13:40.444 --> 13:41.570
...but if you never see me again

13:41.654 --> 13:42.821
you can have my chicken
at the wedding.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.740
[laughs]

13:44.823 --> 13:46.242
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.496
Whoa, whoa, I ordered
50 chickens and 85 salmon.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.665
There are only 84 salmon here.
I'm missing a salmon.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.459
I can't believe
I'm missing a salmon!

13:55.543 --> 13:57.753
You're missing a lot more
than a salmon.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.968
Hey, um, how are you doing?
Are you still in pain?

14:04.051 --> 14:07.513
Oh, well, sometimes I black out

14:07.596 --> 14:09.056
and that's a nice relief.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.809
Okay, look, there's something
I have to tell you.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.144
Oh, God, they called. They can't
find the dress, right?

14:14.228 --> 14:16.564
No, no, it's on its way.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.024
What I wanted to tell you, um..

14:20.192 --> 14:22.945
Okay, hypothetically speaking

14:23.028 --> 14:25.322
if there was a tidal wave

14:25.406 --> 14:27.491
heading towards New York

14:27.575 --> 14:29.493
would you wanna know
it was coming

14:29.577 --> 14:31.745
or would you prefer
to be surprised

14:31.829 --> 14:33.914
and see if you survive?

14:33.998 --> 14:36.500
Are there any salmon
in this tidal wave?

14:36.584 --> 14:37.459
Look..

14:37.543 --> 14:38.919
[knocking on door]

14:40.671 --> 14:42.965
One wedding dress
for Ms. Val Tyler.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.135
Oh, oh! It's here!
Let me see her, let me see her.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.804
Uh, yeah. Oh, I wanna hug you.

14:48.887 --> 14:52.308
- Aw.
- Not you, the dress!

14:52.391 --> 14:56.145
- Bam!
- Whoa! What the hell is that?

14:56.228 --> 14:57.479
Well, something old,
something new

14:57.563 --> 14:59.982
something borrowed,
something ew!

15:00.065 --> 15:01.734
- Where is my dress?
- Well.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.069
We tried to get it back, but
there was a scary Italian lady

15:04.153 --> 15:05.779
who says she knows the Pope
and we had to kiss his feet.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.905
And I ain't kissing
no old man's feet--

15:06.989 --> 15:08.616
My wedding is ruined!

15:08.699 --> 15:12.286
Okay, look, it's not gonna be
ruined by a dress.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.748
There's a lot of, um, other
things that can ruin weddings.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.249
No, Holly,
it's not just the dress

15:17.333 --> 15:20.336
it's the flowers,
the napkins, the salmon!

15:20.419 --> 15:22.129
These are all omens.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.339
I'm gonna go upstairs
and go to bed.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.840
Maybe I'll have
that recurring nightmare

15:24.923 --> 15:26.342
where I'm naked at my wedding.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.178
Oh, wait, I will be.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.804
You know what? She'll be fine.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.432
She just needs a house call
from her doctor.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.351
Johnny Walker, M.D.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.689
Holly, we're sorry. We really
did try to get the dress back.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.900
I know, and I appreciate it.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.360
Would you mind giving me
some time alone?

15:44.443 --> 15:47.196
I've to figure out
this whole Rick and Julie thing.

15:47.279 --> 15:48.989
- You got it.
- Thanks.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.369
- What?
- Well..

15:53.452 --> 15:56.455
It's, it's just that
the dress cost us a 100 bucks.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.875
But that's cool.
Pay us when you can.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.212
[clears throat]

16:03.295 --> 16:04.546
Hey, Rick.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.506
[chuckles]

16:05.589 --> 16:08.926
First time today I've seen you.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.637
Yeah, and-and now we're leaving,
uh, to go have <i> pizza.</i>

16:11.720 --> 16:14.264
I mean, not that that means
anything in particular.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.146
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:21.230 --> 16:22.064
Is Val around?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.148
Just got this message on my cell

16:23.232 --> 16:24.608
about the dress and her back--

16:24.692 --> 16:25.818
Uh-huh. Yeah, she's upstairs.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.403
Her back's
still pretty messed up.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.114
Huh. That's all the stress
from planning this wedding.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.741
- She's taking on too much.
- Oh, right.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.160
Well, maybe it's just
because she loves you so much

16:35.244 --> 16:37.955
and she just wants
everything to be perfect.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.040
- I love her, too.
- Right.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.793
So, um, how was New Jersey?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.587
New Jersey was New Jersey.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.922
Yeah, that's funny.

16:47.005 --> 16:49.258
I forgot, how do you usually
get to New Jersey?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.509
Is there a shortcut

16:50.592 --> 16:53.178
through a <i> pizza</i> place in Queens?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.055
- What?
- I saw you and Julie today.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.807
And don't you think
about having me whacked

16:56.890 --> 16:59.768
because Gary, Vince and Ben
saw you, too.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.353
Okay, Holly, listen, uh..

17:01.437 --> 17:04.106
Julie called me and said she
wanted to give me her blessing.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.442
She said that it would,
it would help her have closure.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.153
I left her at the altar, Holly.
I owed her that.

17:09.236 --> 17:10.445
Okay, if it's all so innocent

17:10.529 --> 17:12.156
then why didn't you
just tell Val?

17:12.239 --> 17:13.531
Have you met your sister?

17:13.615 --> 17:15.117
Her eye twitched for three days
when she found out

17:15.200 --> 17:17.077
the wedding singer didn't know
any Michael Bolton!

17:17.161 --> 17:19.954
Okay, this is so not
the same thing.

17:20.038 --> 17:21.330
I mean, if it wasn't
that big of a deal--

17:21.415 --> 17:24.251
Holly, there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

17:24.334 --> 17:26.878
Rick! Oh, I thought
I heard you down here.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.464
[knocking on door]

17:28.547 --> 17:30.549
I've had the worst day.
Everything is falling apart.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.259
I'm so glad you're here. Mm..

17:32.342 --> 17:35.637
Hey, um, Val, this is Nikki.
She's here about the dress.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.974
Hi. I found out where you lived
from the thrift-store lady.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.601
Oh, please, God,
let that be my dress.

17:40.684 --> 17:43.645
Yeah, I got to thinking
about what those two guys said

17:43.729 --> 17:45.814
about how this was
your dream dress.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.150
I can't take that away from you.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.651
Oh.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.529
We didn't have a lot of money
after my father's operation.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.490
So finding it
was like a miracle.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.825
And it was a miracle
that I fit into it.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.329
I don't know if you heard it,
but I used to tip in at 230.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.747
Oh, my God!

18:01.830 --> 18:05.250
Did you go to Camp Chubby-Wubby
in Great Neck?

18:06.585 --> 18:10.047
- No.
- Me, neither.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.841
Well, anyway,
it really is a beautiful dress.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.301
I felt like Cinderella in it.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.053
So what are you gonna do
for a wedding dress?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.222
Back to the thrift store

18:18.305 --> 18:21.099
but at least
I'm still marrying a great guy.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.352
Oh, this guy he's like

18:23.435 --> 18:25.020
chocolate-chip cheesecake

18:25.103 --> 18:27.231
with fudge sauce
drizzled on top.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.651
No, he's like a glazed donut

18:30.734 --> 18:32.027
that when you bite into it

18:32.110 --> 18:34.530
all of a sudden
peanut butter shoots out.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.617
Somebody's obsessed with carbs.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.662
A total surprise, you know,
just like me finding love

18:41.745 --> 18:45.040
'cause, you know, that's what
this is all about, love.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.042
'It doesn't matter
about the dresses'

18:47.125 --> 18:51.255
or the fish or chicken
or overbearing mothers.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.382
When you find your soul mate

18:53.465 --> 18:55.634
nothing else matters.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.637
You know what? She's right.
This is about you and me.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.223
Yes, so let's
get past the wedding

19:01.306 --> 19:04.059
and on to our marriage
'cause I can't wait.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.603
Oh, my God,
you've got a good one, too.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.772
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.777
I'm sorry.
I've been such an idiot.

19:13.861 --> 19:15.904
- Thank you.
- Oh, my pleasure.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.281
Well, look, I better get going.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.032
The thrift store
closes in an hour.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.451
Maybe I'll find
another miracle dress.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.371
Have a happy life.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.999
Uh, uh, wait a minute.

19:31.044 --> 19:32.713
You forgot something.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.423
Oh, no way.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.717
No, you just gave me something

19:36.800 --> 19:38.427
and I wanna give you something.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.387
Are you serious?

19:40.470 --> 19:43.348
Oh, my God.
Do you know what you are?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.934
You are a hot-chocolate <i> souffle</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:47.394
on a cold winter's night

19:47.477 --> 19:49.146
[laughs]

19:49.229 --> 19:51.356
- Oh.
- Thank you so much!

19:51.440 --> 19:53.275
Now, I'm gonna get out of here
really fast

19:53.358 --> 19:55.611
before you change your mind.

19:55.694 --> 19:58.947
Hey! You got a good one, too.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.282
Bye!

20:02.034 --> 20:03.952
Hey, Val..

20:04.036 --> 20:06.371
...that was really sweet
what you did.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.290
No, it was really sweet
what you guys did

20:08.373 --> 20:09.583
putting up with me today.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.418
- Hm, today?
- Today?

20:12.711 --> 20:14.421
You know,
I didn't think it was possible

20:14.504 --> 20:15.964
but I think
I love you even more.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.425
Aw, that's really sweet,
very touching.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.303
Now, what the hell are you
gonna wear to your wedding?

20:21.386 --> 20:24.973
Lauren, we're having
a moment here, alright?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.017
Okay, moment over.
I have no dress, ladies.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.518
Let's go.
Bergdorf's closes in an hour.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.145
Okay, I'll meet you
right outside.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.064
Okay, bye, see ya.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.901
What you said about Julie
makes sense

20:35.984 --> 20:38.236
but something still
just doesn't feel right.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.072
- Holly--
- But she's happy.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.491
So I'm not gonna say anything

20:42.574 --> 20:44.910
but if you ever hurt my sister..

20:47.162 --> 20:49.331
...it'll be
a lot harder than that.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.674
