besides vodka mixed with blood

01:31:17.773 --> 01:31:20.776
you'd think after all these
centuries

01:31:20.809 --> 01:31:24.647
the mark of civilization would
have come across one other product

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.849
that mixes with vod...

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:33.455
Find something that will keep
its own flavor

01:31:33.488 --> 01:31:35.658
without effecting the flavor of
the blood

01:31:37.593 --> 01:31:39.327
though I look old

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:41.697
yet I'm strong and lusty

01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:44.600
for in my youth, I never did
apply

01:31:44.633 --> 01:31:47.570

just a little bit closer

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:22.524
you know, the perfect thing
would be

01:39:22.557 --> 01:39:26.728
have breakfast in bed and watch
the sun come up

01:39:26.761 --> 01:39:31.966
perfect would be if the sun never
came up and I could stay here forever

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.838
you're going to stay right here,
just like this

01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:39.574

to get back to base sooner or later

01:39:54.922 --> 01:39:56.524

very late
