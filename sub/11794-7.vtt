00:02.035 --> 00:03.636
( bell rings )

00:03.670 --> 00:06.873
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.906 --> 00:09.776
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.809 --> 00:12.679
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.712 --> 00:16.082
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:21.921
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.955 --> 00:25.025
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:27.994
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.897
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:34.501
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:39.005
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:53.019 --> 00:56.022
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:56.056 --> 00:58.858
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:03.063
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:20.547 --> 01:22.982
 Teenage girls are suckers
 for the great poets,

01:23.083 --> 01:26.920
 like Jon Bon Jovi,
 Axl Rose, Jazzy Jeff.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.621
 And I found this romantic dude

01:28.655 --> 01:30.757
 who's going to help me
 win Kelly's heart...

01:30.790 --> 01:34.160
   Rap master
   Will Shakespeare.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.763
( bell rings )

01:45.839 --> 01:48.541
I suppose they're not
going to ring the bell,

01:48.575 --> 01:50.710
so we'll start anyway.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.680
   All right, class.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.116
  We're going
  to perform passages

01:56.116 --> 02:00.720
from the balcony scene
in "Romeo and Juliet."

02:00.754 --> 02:05.191
  And do we all know
  who the author is?

02:05.225 --> 02:08.061
 William Shakespeare.

02:08.061 --> 02:11.231
 Shame on you!
 William Shakespeare.

02:13.199 --> 02:16.469
   Now, our first...
   our first Juliet

02:16.503 --> 02:18.638
 will be Miss Turtle.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.208
 Do we have any volunteers
 for our first Romeo?

02:22.242 --> 02:23.810
Me, me!

02:23.843 --> 02:26.146
   Then I'll have
   to pick someone.

02:26.179 --> 02:28.214
  Anyone but Screech.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.817
  That's a wonderful
  suggestion.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.820
Mr. Screech,
you may begin.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.792
 "But, soft! What light
 through yonder window breaks?"

02:38.825 --> 02:40.593
   Give me a break.

02:40.627 --> 02:44.097
 "It is the east,
 and Juliet is the...

02:44.931 --> 02:46.633
   ...sun."

02:49.102 --> 02:53.006
  Arise,
  dear Juliet and let's cutteth
  to the chase.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.642
   - Back off, Romeo.
   - O fair maiden,

02:55.675 --> 02:59.112
   I long to plant
   one on thy lips,
   so pucker up-eth!

02:59.112 --> 03:00.513
 Drop deadeth!

03:00.547 --> 03:02.782
Oh, wonderful.

03:02.816 --> 03:06.853
   But the swordfight
   didn't come until later.

03:06.886 --> 03:10.156
 Now, we're going to need
 two more volunteers.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.792
 For Romeo...

03:12.826 --> 03:14.861
  How about you,
  Mr. Slater?

03:15.662 --> 03:17.097
   Hey, don't worry,

03:17.130 --> 03:20.133
  the wrestling team will never
  hear about this from me...

03:20.166 --> 03:22.802
Romeo.

03:22.836 --> 03:26.539
  Ms. Simpson, as much
  as I would love to do this,

03:26.573 --> 03:29.175
   Morris here,
   he's a much better actor.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.944
He could be another
Pee Wee Herman.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.750
Mr. Morris, very well.
And for Juliet?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.987
Hey, Kelly, there's
a spider on your chair!

03:41.087 --> 03:44.190
  Oh, Miss Kapowski.
  Excellent.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.627
 Hey, hey wait!
 Okay, Ms. Simpson, I'll do it.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.097
   I'm sorry, you're too late.
   We already have a Juliet.

03:52.999 --> 03:56.936
 Now then, why don't
 we transform

03:56.970 --> 03:59.773
  "yon" desk into a balcony,

03:59.806 --> 04:02.642
so that we may realize
the full impact

04:02.676 --> 04:05.245
of this dramatic scene?

04:09.816 --> 04:13.286
 All right, Romeo.
 You spy your beloved

04:13.319 --> 04:16.690
at her window,
and you begin.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.260
 Check it out.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.933
  "It 'tis my lady,
  O it 'tis my love.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.069
  O, that she knew she were!

04:29.069 --> 04:30.904
Her eyes in heaven
shone so bright

04:30.937 --> 04:34.674
 That birds would sing
 and think it were not night.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.077
   O, see how she leans
   her cheek upon her hand!

04:39.879 --> 04:41.681
O, that I were
a glove upon that hand,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.350
  That I might
  touch that cheek!"

04:43.383 --> 04:45.185
 Wow!

04:45.218 --> 04:47.354
 Stay putteth, Juliet.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.390
Oh, drat! There goes
my back again!

04:50.423 --> 04:51.991
   Ms. Simpson,
   are you all right?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.860
  This happens
  every now and again.

04:53.893 --> 04:56.363
It's an old
hockey injury.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.333
 We've got to get you
 to the nurse.

05:00.367 --> 05:01.468
Thank you, Miss Spano,

05:01.501 --> 05:05.305
 but I really don't think
 l can walk in this position.

05:05.338 --> 05:08.341
   No sweat, Ms. Simpson,
   I've got an idea.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.679
 Okay now, don't worry,
 Ms. Simpson,

05:12.712 --> 05:14.280
 we'll get you
 to the nurse.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.116
Okay, let's
bring her out!

05:22.122 --> 05:24.124
   Come on,
   come on.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.059
   Okay now, you've got
   to take it slow,

05:26.092 --> 05:27.694
all right, Ms. Simpson?

05:27.727 --> 05:29.362
  - Okay, hold on.
  - Careful.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.064
 - Whoa.
 - Here we go.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.667
- Okay.
- Take it easy.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.069
 Here's your sweater,
 Ms. Simpson.

05:36.069 --> 05:39.272
And here's
your briefcase.

05:39.305 --> 05:43.243
  Thank you.
  That feels like everything.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.713
Hey, hey, hey!
What is going on here?

05:46.746 --> 05:49.182
  Well, Ms. Simpson
  hurt herself, Mr. Belding.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.084
 Ms. Simpson, did your back
 go out again?

05:51.117 --> 05:54.087
No, no.
My back went out again.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.923
 We're taking her
 to the nurse.

05:56.956 --> 06:00.026
 Oh, lovely shoes,
 Mr. Belding.

06:01.761 --> 06:05.165
 Woman on PA: <i>Mr. Belding,</i>
<i>hurry to the gymnasium.</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:07.367
   <i>Tiny Hartwick is caught</i>
   <i>in the net again.</i>

06:09.302 --> 06:12.739
  I told them to stop
  using him as a volleyball.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.774
 Ms. Simpson, as long
 as you're going by my office,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.409
   would you mind dropping
   these off for me?

06:16.443 --> 06:19.045
   - No, not at all.
   - Thanks.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.183
 - Okay, now hold on.
 - Here we go.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.222
 Screech, behold!
 My lady sits eating.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.791
  Shove off, Morris.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.795
   I ignore the insults
   of the ignorant,

06:36.296 --> 06:39.232
 and approach my love.

06:39.265 --> 06:42.168
   Oh, to be that straw,
   sitting in my lady's cup.

06:44.504 --> 06:47.207
   Gladly would I be
   made of plastic,

06:47.240 --> 06:50.110
   and risk drowning
   in a sea of cola,

06:50.143 --> 06:54.214
  for the chance to touch
  fair Kelly's lips.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.916
   Oh, Zack.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.386
  Okay, Preppie.
  While you're treading cola,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.454
 Kelly and I are going
 to the beach.

07:01.488 --> 07:06.026
Kelly, this news
disappoints me verily.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.129
  I thought we could rehearse
  more scenes from
  "Romeo and Juliet."

07:09.162 --> 07:12.165
 That's a great idea, Zack.
 Sorry, Slater.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.401
 What?

07:14.434 --> 07:18.204
   I can't believe this.
   You'd rather study
   than go to beach?

07:18.238 --> 07:20.874
   "Parting is such
   sweet sorrow..."

07:22.842 --> 07:24.210
chump!

07:26.846 --> 07:28.882
  Fair Lisa,

07:28.915 --> 07:32.786
would that I were that blob
of ketchup lying
on your plate...

07:35.055 --> 07:38.525
 so that you may dip
 your French fries in my face.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.973
 All right, everyone,
 settle down.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.409
  Now as you know,
  Ms.
  Simpson is in the hospital,

07:56.443 --> 07:58.411
 so you'll be having
 a substitute teacher.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.814
  ( cheers )

08:00.847 --> 08:03.817
I expect you to be
on your best behavior,

08:03.850 --> 08:07.120
and treat him with the same
respect you show me.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.026
Do you really
mean that, sir?

08:13.059 --> 08:15.795
  Zachary,
  if I hear anything

08:15.829 --> 08:18.832
   about exploding chalk,
   superglue on the chairs,

08:18.865 --> 08:20.467
or sneezing powder
in the erasers,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
 I'm coming after you.

08:22.535 --> 08:24.938
  But sir, that's so unfair.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.940
   I'm the principal.
   I can be unfair.

08:30.276 --> 08:34.047
  Well,
  let's see what kind of dweeb
  they throw at us this time.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.349
   Good morning,
   everyone.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.884
I'm Tony Crane.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.858
  You're right, Zack.

08:44.891 --> 08:48.061
The guy looks like
a dweeb to me.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.163
  Why don't you tell me
  all of your names,

08:50.196 --> 08:51.297
  starting with you?

08:51.331 --> 08:53.333
- I'm Slater.
- I'm Screech.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.868
  I'm yours.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.537
  I'm bummed.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.444
 Now as you are
 about to see,

09:04.477 --> 09:07.514
  I teach Shakespeare
  just a little differently.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.417
  I want you to feel it
  as well as hear it.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.252
I want you to live it.

09:12.285 --> 09:15.188
   Now, all we
   need is a Juliet.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.494
 Okay, Kelly.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.932
 Let's turn you
 into Juliet.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.669
I didn't know Juliet
was a conehead.

09:31.438 --> 09:34.040
 Shh!

09:34.040 --> 09:37.544
Now remember,
above all else

09:37.577 --> 09:40.413
   "Romeo and Juliet"
   is a love story.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.383
Romeo is so charged
with romantic desires,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.685
he feels he can
fly over walls,

09:45.719 --> 09:50.090
 that no barrier can possibly
 separate him from his beloved.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.393
   We've all felt that way at
   some point in our lives,
   haven't we?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.261
  ( all women sighing )
  Yes.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.064
He must have
read my diary.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.699
 Yeah, and then he
 borrowed your blouse.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.272
 "With love's light wings
 did I o'er-perch these walls;

10:06.306 --> 10:09.142
For stony limits cannot
hold love out,

10:09.175 --> 10:12.345
   And what love can do
   that dares love attempt."

10:12.379 --> 10:15.382
"lf my kinsmen see thee,
they will murder thee."

10:15.415 --> 10:17.751
 - Go kinsmen!
 - Guys: Yeah!

10:20.420 --> 10:25.091
 "Look thou but sweet, and I am
 proof against their enmity."

10:25.125 --> 10:27.160
   Now what do you
   think that means, Jessie?

10:28.094 --> 10:29.696
 Whatever you
 say, Tony...

10:31.131 --> 10:34.034
   I mean Mr. Crane.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.503
  Does anyone know what
  Shakespeare's saying here?

10:36.536 --> 10:38.204
  Nothing, he's dead.

10:40.106 --> 10:43.543
   I think he's saying
   love is totally awesome.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.278
 ( laughing )

10:45.311 --> 10:47.147
No.
Yes, in a way.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.150
   Love is so awesome
   that Romeo feels

10:50.183 --> 10:53.386
   a sweet look from Juliet
   will make him invincible.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.321
( bell rings )

10:55.355 --> 10:57.424
Okay, we'll continue
this tomorrow.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.343
I said we'll continue
this tomorrow.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.078
  All:
  We'll wait.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.781
   Hey, Kelly, you want to play
   some Video Bowl?

11:21.815 --> 11:24.684
Sorry, Slater. I don't have
time for kids' games.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.653
 We're studying
 Shakespeare.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.123
 Do you mind? Tony might
 call on me tomorrow.

11:30.156 --> 11:33.793
   Tony? What's this big deal
   about Mr. Crane, anyway?

11:33.827 --> 11:37.263
  He's nothing special.
  You put a headlock on him,

11:37.297 --> 11:40.200
he'll go down to the mat
just like anyone else.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.635
   Slater, you are clearly
   incapable of appreciating

11:42.669 --> 11:44.270
someone like Mr. Crane.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.706
   He uses his mind,
   not his muscles.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.708
   What's happening?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.877
   We were trying to explain
   our new
   substitute to these guys,

11:50.910 --> 11:53.813
 but I guess you
 can't expect boys
 to understand a man.

11:53.847 --> 11:58.151
 No, I guess only
 someone with your
 sophistication could do that.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.755
  You had the root beer float
  with the Gummi Bear swirl?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.329
Greetings,
sweet maidens.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.731
   I salute your
   beauty and grace.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.233
   Hi, Zack.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.808
   Fair Kelly, shall we again
   prepare together for
   class on the morrow?

12:21.841 --> 12:24.811
Sorry, Zack, I don't have
time to play dress up.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.451
   It's him!

12:31.484 --> 12:34.187
 Hey, Slater, now's your chance
 to put a headlock on him.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.859
   - He sees us!
   - What do we do?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.195
  We could go to the jukebox.
  It's 10 feet closer to him.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.264
   Great idea.
   Don't be obvious.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.235
  Something's rotten
  in The Max.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.604
  For once,
  it's not the chili.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.573
  It's going to
  get worse, Preppie.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.809
 I've seen this
 in other schools
 I've been to.

12:55.842 --> 12:58.278
Some smooth-talking teacher
will come in,

12:58.311 --> 13:01.314
  before you know it,
  he's stolen all our women.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.217
 He's going
 to take our mothers?

13:04.250 --> 13:07.554
  No, not our mothers,
  our girls.

13:07.587 --> 13:09.622
 Aren't you guys
 overreacting?

13:09.656 --> 13:13.626
 He's probably got a girlfriend
 of his own.
 He could be married.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.894
   Yeah, maybe you're right.

13:14.928 --> 13:18.765
I bet he doesn't even know
those girls are alive.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.201
   Would you girls
   care to join me?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.602
 Sure!

13:25.839 --> 13:27.340
  ( glass shatters )

13:29.576 --> 13:31.378
Okay, so he knows
they're alive.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.347
What'd I tell you, huh?

13:34.381 --> 13:36.850
 This guy is trouble.

13:36.883 --> 13:40.520
 Slater, we spend most
 of our time
 fighting over Kelly.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.523
 But maybe,
 just for now,

13:43.556 --> 13:45.592
   we should join forces
   against the common enemy.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.460
What did I do?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.929
  Not you, Screech.
  Tony Crane.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.298
  So what do you say, Slater?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.734
Agreed.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.002
Truce.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.471
  Ow!

13:59.906 --> 14:03.243
That was
the most romantic lunch
I've ever had.

14:03.276 --> 14:06.246
I'll remember it
for as long as l live.

14:06.913 --> 14:10.216
You know,
now that I've met Tony,

14:10.250 --> 14:12.218
  I know that's the kind of man
  I'm going to marry.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.654
  - Oh, me too.
  - Personally,
  I've always thought

14:14.688 --> 14:18.058
planning my career was more
important than
finding a husband...

14:18.658 --> 14:20.326
  until now.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.766
 ( humming
 "The Wedding March" )

14:34.708 --> 14:36.676
How do I look?

14:36.710 --> 14:39.079
Beautiful.
What about me?

14:40.880 --> 14:45.518
Jessie, you're one of three
prettiest brides
I've ever seen.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.454
   I can't wait
   for my honeymoon,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.489
  Tony's taking me to Paris.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.691
   I've heard they have
   great French food there.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.993
   Tony and I are
   going to Hawaii.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.529
  - Waikiki?
  - Why not?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.932
   I've heard it's
   really romantic.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.468
  We're going to the desert
  for our honeymoon.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.870
  I love the beach.
  He hates the ocean.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.340
Wait a minute.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.743
   How could Tony take me
   on a honeymoon
   with both of you?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.678
  What kind
  of fantasy is this?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.813
  - ( knocking )
  - All: It's him. It's Tony!

15:13.847 --> 15:15.415
   He's come for his bride.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.652
  I'm sorry.
  I can't marry you.

15:19.686 --> 15:23.056
 I'll be leaving soon.
 I'm only a substitute teacher.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.526
Well,
then who will we marry?

15:26.559 --> 15:27.927
  Guess who?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.368
 I never thought
 Tony might leave us.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.337
 You never think
 when you're in love.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.446
  It seems Ms. Simpson
  took a turn for the worse,

15:46.479 --> 15:50.450
 she didn't show up today.
 So we had to
 come up with a plan.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.086
   Her name is Vicki.
   She's an actress.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.554
   ( Brooklyn accent )
   Where's my money?

15:55.755 --> 15:57.457
A professional actress.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.160
You might remember her
as the third pepperoni

16:00.193 --> 16:02.796
  on the dancing pizza
  commercial.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.631
   I love your work.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.935
   Here's the money.

16:09.035 --> 16:11.871
 All of the guys in Mr. Crane's
 classes chipped in.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.406
  Thank you.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.610
   Okay, Vicki, now the bell's
   going to ring any minute.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.679
   The most handsome hunk
   you've ever seen

16:19.713 --> 16:21.948
  is going to come walking
  around that corner.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.784
  You just stop him in the hall
  and play
  the scene we rehearsed.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.653
Got it.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.122
 Now don't let
 him get away,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.491
  because the girls are going
  to be coming from gym class

16:31.524 --> 16:33.626
 and they have to see
 you and him together.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.863
 - I understand.
 - And you remember your cue?

16:36.896 --> 16:39.466
When you guys say
hello and wave to him,

16:39.499 --> 16:41.501
   I come running
   into the hallway.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.537
   - Right.
   - ( bell rings )

16:45.772 --> 16:46.840
 Hello, boys.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.875
  - Hello!
  - Both: No!

16:48.908 --> 16:52.812
( German accent )
Darling, there you are.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.582
 Oh, my love.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.685
  I could not wait
  until June.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.255
   I took the first
   plane in from Rome.
   Let's get married today.

17:02.288 --> 17:05.425
   June? Rome?
   Married?

17:05.458 --> 17:08.028
Excuse me, but boy have
you got the wrong man.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.797
The wrong man?

17:10.829 --> 17:12.866
 Darling, don't
 joke with me.

17:12.898 --> 17:16.102
   How could there be two men
   as beautiful as are you?

17:16.136 --> 17:18.905
   I know it's hard to believe.
   But it must be true.

17:18.938 --> 17:22.041
   Please, I can't
   wait another day

17:22.075 --> 17:24.644
   to become
   Mrs. Tony Crane.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.446
  Tony Crane?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.959
   Mr. Crane, do you have
   an explanation for this?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.896
  ( Brooklyn accent )
  Oh no. I got the wrong guy?

17:44.064 --> 17:47.067
That's right.
The wrong guy.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.536
 I should have known
 this wasn't the handsome hunk.

17:51.171 --> 17:55.075
( bell rings )

17:55.075 --> 17:58.745
   All right, everybody
   get where you were going

17:58.778 --> 18:00.880
before I start handing
out detention.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.618
  Go, go, go!

18:07.253 --> 18:10.724
   Mr. Crane, do you have
   an explanation for this?

18:10.757 --> 18:13.593
 lf you give me a few minutes
 Mr. Belding, I think l will.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.929
   Fine. I'll meet
   you in my office.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.035
   Well, if you ever
   need an actress, call me.

18:22.035 --> 18:24.304
 Gotta run.
 Linguini commercial.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.710
   Okay, will the occupants

18:30.744 --> 18:32.278
of lockers 140,

18:32.312 --> 18:35.648
   142 and 144
   please come out?

18:40.153 --> 18:42.255
  Okay, guys.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.324
   What did I do to deserve
   this performance?

18:46.226 --> 18:49.929
 Mr. Crane, ever since you came
 here, the girls act
 like we don't exist.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.299
 Yeah, they keep on telling us
 you're this sophisticated man

18:53.333 --> 18:55.068
  and we're nothing but kids.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.804
So we thought if
we could make them
think you were engaged,

18:57.837 --> 19:00.907
   then maybe they'd
   forget about you
   and remember us.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.009
   Sounded like a good plan.

19:03.009 --> 19:06.179
   Yeah, but we should've hired
   an actress with
   hallway experience.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.150
You know, guys,

19:10.183 --> 19:13.520
 I really have no intention
 of taking your girls from you.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.789
   I'm sorry if my coming here
   has caused you problems,

19:15.822 --> 19:17.724
   but what do you want me
   to do, give up teaching?

19:17.757 --> 19:19.059
 - Would you?
 - No.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.698
 But I do understand
 how you feel.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.633
I just don't think that
trying to embarrass me

19:26.666 --> 19:28.702
   is the solution
   to your problem.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.604
 You're right.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.340
   - Okay, we're sorry.
   - Yeah.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.875
   Okay. Why don't you go
   ahead into class?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.278
   I gotta smooth this over
   with Belding.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.114
- All right.
Thanks, Mr. Crane.
- Yeah, thanks.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.218
   Just stay away
   from our mothers.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.690
   Mr. Crane!
   Sorry we're late,

19:50.724 --> 19:53.126
but the field hockey game
went into sudden death.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.362
   - I scored the winning goal.
   - Listen, no problem.

19:55.395 --> 19:58.264
 Why don't you
 just go into class?
 I'll be right there.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.734
 He touched me!
 I told you he liked me best.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.136
Oh, yeah right.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.672
I wonder why Tony
wanted to meet us here.

20:05.705 --> 20:08.208
   Maybe he couldn't hide his
   true feelings any longer.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.144
   Jessie, you really think
   he's in love with
   all three of us?

20:11.177 --> 20:13.279
Well, maybe
just one of us.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.248
This is the happiest
day of my life.

20:15.281 --> 20:17.217
I want you both to be
my bridesmaids.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.319
   Hey, not you, me!

20:19.352 --> 20:21.087
You? It's me he loves.

20:21.121 --> 20:23.023
When he looked at me
during the fire drill,

20:23.056 --> 20:24.691
 the smoke detectors went off.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.192
Oh, yeah right.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.328
   ( all shouting )

20:28.361 --> 20:30.797
Hey, chill out, ladies.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.199
  Look, the biggest moment
  in one of our lives

20:33.233 --> 20:35.468
   is about to happen,
   and we need to be alone.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.270
 So do you guys
 mind leaving?

20:37.303 --> 20:40.273
 Well, sorry. Mr. Crane told us
 to meet him here after class.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.943
  - Why would he want you here?
  - He didn't tell us.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.880
How sweet.
Ushers for our wedding.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.816
Could you boys
sit over there?

20:49.849 --> 20:51.885
- ( Zack scoffs )
- Slater: Boys?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.321
Here he comes!

20:56.890 --> 20:58.491
Right in here, <i>darling.</i>

21:02.562 --> 21:04.264
This is the place where
all the kids hang out.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.133
  ( German accent )
  It's cute.

21:07.167 --> 21:09.402
 Here are three of the guys
 I've been teaching.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.871
  Guys, this is Vicki,
  my fiancee.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.775
 Pleased to meet you.

21:15.809 --> 21:17.977
Um, same here.

21:21.915 --> 21:23.850
  What a coincidence.

21:28.088 --> 21:31.091
  She really is his fiancee.

21:32.092 --> 21:33.827
  And, honey,

21:33.860 --> 21:35.528
  these are three
  of the young ladies
  I've been teaching.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.263
Hello.

21:37.297 --> 21:39.833
 Are you in the same
 grade as those guys?

21:39.866 --> 21:42.435
   - Yes.
   - Really?
   You look so much younger.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.107
 Well, I just wanted Vicki
 to meet some of my students.

21:47.107 --> 21:51.344
   Ms. Simpson will
   be back on Monday,
   so this was my last day.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.781
   "O, that a joy past joy
   calls out on me,

21:54.814 --> 21:58.184
 that it were a grief,
 so brief to part with thee."

21:58.218 --> 22:00.053
  Goodbye, Mr. Crane!

22:05.959 --> 22:08.194
   One, two, three... girls!

22:13.066 --> 22:15.869
So what did you think
of Mr. Crane's fiancee?

22:17.170 --> 22:20.273
 She was attractive,
 if you like that exotic type.

22:20.306 --> 22:24.244
   You think so? I think all
   three of you are much
   better looking.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.379
  Oh, yeah.
  No contest.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.081
Why don't you
guys sit down?

22:29.215 --> 22:31.184
 Hey, I was going
 to sit there.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.454
  Tough luck, Preppie.
  The truce is over.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.992
   Hey, Max.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.460
 What can I get
 for you Lisa?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.228
   You can get lost.

22:42.262 --> 22:45.398
  All right,
  we're back to normal! I'd
  like to get lost...

22:51.871 --> 22:53.940
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
