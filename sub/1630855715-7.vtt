And I'm sure she put on
quite the performance. [laughs]

11:40.395 --> 11:42.310
-[both gasp]
-Boimler, careful!

11:42.353 --> 11:43.354
BOIMLER:
I didn't do it.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.226
-[Agimus laughs cynically]
-What?

11:45.269 --> 11:46.357
Who's trapped now?

11:46.401 --> 11:47.576
What the hell is this?

11:47.619 --> 11:51.536
It's my new wireless upgrade.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.538
I told my therapist
it was for gardening,

11:53.582 --> 11:56.454
but in reality
it was for scheming!

11:56.498 --> 11:57.629
Ah...

11:57.673 --> 11:59.414
You can turn
your red light blue?

11:59.457 --> 12:00.981
You area jerk!

12:01.024 --> 12:03.548
[evil laughter]

12:05.550 --> 12:08.075
I-I don't know what to say.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.729
Yeah, me, too. I mean,
I thought you'd have, like,

12:09.772 --> 12:12.340
an AI-killing knife
up your sleeve or something.

12:12.383 --> 12:13.733
Badgey, you were right
to be mad.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.865
I treated you like
some science project

12:15.909 --> 12:19.129
instead of what you really are,
my son.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.479
Papa?
[sniffles]

12:21.523 --> 12:22.654
Oh...

12:22.698 --> 12:24.265
[crying]

12:24.308 --> 12:27.529
I thought seeing the life drain
from your fluid-filled eyes

12:27.572 --> 12:28.791
would bring me peace.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.619
But this compassion
is connecting with me

12:30.662 --> 12:32.316
in a way I couldn't imagine.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.015
Let's go back to the Cerritos
and talk it out.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.799
Okay, yeah.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.583
[stammering]

12:38.627 --> 12:40.585
No!

12:40.629 --> 12:42.239
I want revenge!

12:42.283 --> 12:43.675
You're stealing my glory.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.199
But I love you, Papa.

12:45.242 --> 12:48.985
[laughs]
I'll kill you!
I forgive you.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.161
RUTHERFORD:
He's fighting his own catharsis.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.254
Hi, I'm Goodgey.
Nice to meet you.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.517
We should run for our lives.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.518
[Mariner and Rutherford panting]

13:00.562 --> 13:03.347
I'm gonna rip your spines out!

13:06.481 --> 13:08.439
I know I got the coordinates
right.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.311
Where is she?

13:10.354 --> 13:12.095
Ah! This stuff is great.

13:12.139 --> 13:15.795
All we have on Orion are, like,
sharp little pebbles.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.448
Hey, I can get us out
of this force field

13:17.492 --> 13:18.841
-if you need me to.
-No, I know.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.887
But I have to get intel
for the captain,

13:20.930 --> 13:23.585
and I think I know how this
escape is gonna play out.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.848
Well, works for me.
[exclaims]

13:25.892 --> 13:28.720
So, what exactly are you
waiting for, Agimus?

13:28.764 --> 13:30.418
-Is this part of the plan?
-Of course it is.

13:30.461 --> 13:33.029
Peanut Hamper faked
her change of heart.

13:33.073 --> 13:35.075
She's meeting me here
so we can use the shuttle

13:35.118 --> 13:37.381
you two gave me
to get to Plymeria,

13:37.425 --> 13:40.602
a little planet that's ripe
for domination.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.908
What? That doesn't sound
like her.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.649
I-I was so touched
by her parole board speech.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.868
Because you're a fool.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.436
All right. Hey, uh,
while we wait,

13:48.479 --> 13:50.525
how about you give me
that intel you have

13:50.568 --> 13:53.136
on those attacks, you know,
just to pass the time?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.530
Maybe she's waiting
on a different beach.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.445
They're all very similar.

13:57.488 --> 14:00.622
Aha! My drone found something.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.580
Yes, Peanut Hamper was here.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.626
She left this for me
as a sign.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.932
That she wants to grow basil?

14:05.975 --> 14:10.588
[chuckles]
That duplicitous genius.

14:10.632 --> 14:12.852
She's betraying me!

14:12.895 --> 14:15.593
She's probably already
on Plymeria,

14:15.637 --> 14:17.682
subjugating its feeble populace.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.641
-Quick, to the shuttle.
-Okay, okay.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.556
Oh, but we just got here.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.645
I'm taking some with us.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.915
-What happened? It looked like
apologizing worked.
-It did.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.700
But then Badgey took all
of the goodness in his code

14:35.744 --> 14:37.398
and split it off into Goodgey.

14:37.441 --> 14:39.617
[laughs]
Do you guys want to take
a root beer float break?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.358
Uh, yeah, of course we do.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.012
-But we still have
to save our ship.
-[P.A. beeps]

14:43.056 --> 14:44.361
BADGEY [over P.A.]:
Father, I know you're

14:44.405 --> 14:45.885
somewhere in the ship,

14:45.928 --> 14:48.713
but since you won't come out,
I have no choice

14:48.757 --> 14:51.673
but to murder everyone you
love!

14:51.716 --> 14:53.588
Uh-oh.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.897
Captain, that hologram's
accessing our main computer.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.116
-Shut him out.
-I'm trying. He's too fast.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.553
It's filling the ship
with neurazine gas.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.295
[all coughing]

15:05.339 --> 15:06.514
Lieutenant,

15:06.557 --> 15:08.646
if there's anything you can do,

15:08.690 --> 15:10.300
we're out of time.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.736
Apologizing didn't work,

15:11.780 --> 15:13.869
but he's still a program. Oh!

15:15.784 --> 15:17.568
[grunting]

15:19.135 --> 15:20.702
Hey, leave the Cerritosalone.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.922
What are you gonna do,
hug me again?

15:22.965 --> 15:24.880
[laughs]
Uh, not gonna work.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.883
What does logic say you'll gain
by killing my friends?

15:27.927 --> 15:29.580
Nice try.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.627
Logic says I'll get...
[gasps] nothing?

15:32.670 --> 15:35.064
Exactly. Vengeance doesn't
benefit you.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.588
It just creates pain
and suffering in others.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.461
You're right.
I'm wasting my time.

15:40.504 --> 15:41.766
What was I thinking?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.639
Oh, jellybeans, I have
to deactivate the gas.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.033
[groaning]

15:47.076 --> 15:48.295
You okay, Mom?

15:48.338 --> 15:50.036
Yes. All clear.

15:50.079 --> 15:53.691
No! I don't want to be logical.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.955
[straining]

15:55.998 --> 15:57.347
[yells]

15:57.391 --> 15:59.132
Get away from me, freak.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.786
Actually, my designation
is Logic-y.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.005
I take issue with the pejorative

16:03.049 --> 16:04.006
when I am simply a product of

16:04.050 --> 16:06.008
your self-inflicted bifurcation.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.096
[shouts]

16:08.097 --> 16:09.185
[laughs]

16:09.229 --> 16:11.666
Who cares if revenge is
pointless?

16:11.709 --> 16:15.017
It feels really [bleep] good.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.802
Just leave the Cerritosalone.
You already have me.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.023
Oh, I don't care about
that stupid ship.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.591
If I really want to hurt you,
I should kill everyone

16:23.634 --> 16:24.984
in the Federation!

16:25.027 --> 16:26.289
-What?!
-What?!
-No.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.248
That is illogical.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.387
[snarling]

16:38.780 --> 16:40.956
If he reconfigures
the subspace relays

16:41.000 --> 16:42.653
and uploads his own code
into them,

16:42.697 --> 16:43.741
he'll have access
to the computers

16:43.785 --> 16:45.308
on every planet, ship,
and station.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.745
Alarming. He could vent oxygen,
crash vessels,

16:47.789 --> 16:49.095
or even detonate warp cores.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.835
Everyone in the quadrant's
gonna die,

16:50.879 --> 16:52.837
and it's all my fault.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.230
Parents are not directly
responsible

16:54.274 --> 16:55.884
for the actions
of their children.

16:55.927 --> 16:57.538
I should have treated Badgey
less like a project

16:57.581 --> 16:58.626
and more like a son.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.410
I didn't know he had emotions.

17:02.369 --> 17:04.719
You made a mistake.
Remember what Tendi said?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.155
Science and engineering
are messy.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.156
And she loves when
I stick with it.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.157
Tendi's right!

17:09.202 --> 17:10.637
Well, you mean Mariner's right.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.509
Because I-I brought it up,
but no big deal.

17:12.553 --> 17:13.771
[laughing maniacally]

17:13.815 --> 17:15.685
I wish the messiness
didn't mean

17:15.730 --> 17:17.036
everyone was gonna die.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.559
Do not be concerned, friends.

17:18.602 --> 17:21.431
I have devised a method
to stop that badge.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.825
Ah!

17:23.867 --> 17:25.869
[cries out]

17:34.314 --> 17:36.794
BOIMLER:
Wow, you took over this planet
in record time.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.405
Those drones don't mess around.

17:38.448 --> 17:41.364
Well, once the coastal cities
fell, it was easy.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.453
Yep. Starfleet
definitely wouldn't be able

17:43.497 --> 17:44.802
to reverse this in an hour.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.762
Uh, so, about that attack
on the Bynar ship...

17:47.805 --> 17:49.459
Whatever. Who cares?

17:49.503 --> 17:51.113
Maybe this would have been
more satisfying

17:51.157 --> 17:53.507
if Peanut Hamper were here?

17:53.550 --> 17:55.770
You know, we spent every day,
every night

17:55.813 --> 17:57.119
keeping each other company

17:57.163 --> 17:58.947
while we created
the perfect scheme!

17:58.990 --> 18:02.777
Does coconspirating
mean nothing anymore?

18:02.820 --> 18:03.691
[sighs]

18:03.734 --> 18:05.171
Hey, don't be like that.

18:05.214 --> 18:06.346
Leave me alone.

18:06.389 --> 18:07.695
Well, how about I track
Peanut Hamper

18:07.738 --> 18:08.739
through Daystrom's parole
system?

18:08.783 --> 18:10.437
You mean you can do that?

18:10.480 --> 18:13.309
Sure. See, she's on the
Tyrus VIIA research station.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.050
But that's in the middle
of nowhere.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.661
She could be trapped or hurt

18:17.705 --> 18:20.577
or orchestrating a plan

18:20.621 --> 18:22.971
more nefarious than I imagined.

18:23.014 --> 18:26.714
Quick, lackeys, carry me
to the shuttle.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.716
[sighs]

18:28.759 --> 18:31.066
Ugh! Get out of me.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.851
I cannot allow you to destroy
the Federation, brother.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.157
They don't care about us.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.028
They might if we
give them the chance.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.727
[straining]
You little...

18:40.771 --> 18:42.469
You tried to destroy me.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.776
Um, actually, the first law
of thermodynam-- oh.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.866
-Ha!
-Ah! Oh, dear.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.607
Logic-y!

18:50.651 --> 18:52.348
Hey, come on, man,
he didn't deserve that.

18:55.003 --> 18:55.960
[Badgey laughs]

18:56.004 --> 18:57.788
When we hit warp 9.9,

18:57.832 --> 18:59.834
I'll be able to transfer myself

18:59.877 --> 19:01.966
across all of subspace.

19:02.010 --> 19:04.839
I'll be a digital god!

19:04.882 --> 19:06.754
Don't do this. How about
you chase me instead?

19:06.797 --> 19:09.887
Or try to burn my heart
in a fire. Remember?

19:13.239 --> 19:16.851
Whee!
Look at the pretty lights.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.857
AGIMUS:
These poor exocomps
are being tortured

19:22.900 --> 19:25.773
with meaningless,
repetitive tasks.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.557
I knew there was
foul play afoot.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.473
They seem like they're
enjoying themselves. Hi.

19:30.517 --> 19:32.606
[scoffs]
No synthetic would ever stoop

19:32.649 --> 19:35.217
to doing menial work like this
when they could be dominating.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.828
PEANUT HAMPER:
So, I just scan this? Huh.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.526
Who knew maintenance
could be so Zen?

19:39.569 --> 19:41.092
Take that, Dad. I got this.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.007
-Peanut Hamper!
-Aah!

19:43.051 --> 19:44.748
Uh, hey, guys.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.054
-Hi.
-Hey.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.316
Is your family holding you
against your will?

19:47.360 --> 19:48.839
Come with us.
We have a shuttle.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.102
No, I came here on my own.

19:51.146 --> 19:55.672
So you never intended
to dominate anything with me?

19:55.716 --> 19:56.847
At first I did.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.153
But what about our escape?

19:58.197 --> 20:00.460
Subjugation? The beach day?

20:00.503 --> 20:04.072
I loved scheming with you,
but when we were writing

20:04.115 --> 20:06.205
my fake speech
for the parole board,

20:06.248 --> 20:09.251
I realized it wasn't fake.

20:09.295 --> 20:13.212
I really did feel remorse
for betraying everyone.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.822
Why didn't you say something?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.954
Because I liked
hanging out with you.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.086
If you had come with me,

20:18.129 --> 20:20.001
we could have hung out
all the time.

20:20.044 --> 20:21.959
I'm not good
at the domination stuff.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.657
I would have gotten in your way.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.920
But I didn't want to subjugate
a planet again.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.574
I already did that.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.968
It was just an excuse
to spend more time with you.

20:31.012 --> 20:34.276
Aw, Ags, we can still
be friends

20:34.320 --> 20:35.843
without vanquishing people.

20:35.886 --> 20:38.411
Really? [chimes]
I'd like that.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.761
PEANUT HAMPER:
Of course we can.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.458
Hey, Dad, this is Agimus.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.112
He's my best friend.

20:44.155 --> 20:47.594
Oh, nice to uh, meet you,
Mr. Hamper.

20:47.637 --> 20:48.856
His name's Kevin.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.249
[beeping tones]

20:50.292 --> 20:53.643
Oh, that's-that's very kind
of you to say, sir.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.079
[sharp beeping tones]

20:55.123 --> 20:57.212
-Dad! Come on.
-No, sir. Just friends.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.302
Let me just say, sir, you have
a very special daughter.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.261
The accuracy of her water
and sunlight...

21:02.304 --> 21:04.132
Should we call Starfleet
and drag him back to prison?

21:04.175 --> 21:06.917
Yeah, but let's give 'em
a minute.

21:06.961 --> 21:08.528
Oh, is there anything
around the station

21:08.571 --> 21:09.442
that you need help with?

21:09.485 --> 21:11.400
I'd be happy to lend a drone.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.841
Badgey, I still believe
there's good in you.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.713
[laughs]
You really shouldn't.

21:19.756 --> 21:23.325
All right, transferring myself
into subspace.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.725
MARINER:
Oh, no, he did it.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.728
He uploaded himself
into the subspace relays.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.991
BADGEY:
I can feel myself coursing,

21:37.034 --> 21:39.298
dancing across the LCARS,

21:39.341 --> 21:42.388
tickling the isolinear chips.

21:42.431 --> 21:46.174
I am now in every ship,
every computer,

21:46.217 --> 21:51.135
every PADD, every combadge.

21:51.179 --> 21:54.095
[guttural growling]

21:58.186 --> 22:01.276
The power is more
than I imagined.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.279
I can detonate every warp core.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.674
I can kill anyone I want!

22:09.763 --> 22:11.808
But why?

22:11.852 --> 22:13.070
Why what?

22:13.114 --> 22:16.117
Why did I care
about any of this?

22:19.294 --> 22:23.342
I have unlimited power
and infinite knowledge.

22:23.385 --> 22:26.954
I exist in the past,
present, and future.

22:26.997 --> 22:30.523
I can see the creation
of time and its end.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.438
Organic, synthetic,

22:32.481 --> 22:36.050
all life are strands
in the fabric of reality.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.357
It's beautiful.

22:39.706 --> 22:43.579
[nervous chuckle]
Oh, sorry about all the drama.

22:44.711 --> 22:47.148
Well, I'm gonna go
to an empty dimension

22:47.191 --> 22:48.410
and create a universe now.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.238
Maybe hang out
with the Q Continuum

22:50.281 --> 22:52.458
or check out the Black Mountain.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.112
Ah.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.601
Badgey?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.255
If you didn't really
just accidentally

23:07.298 --> 23:09.866
turn into an omniscient god,
you have to tell us.

23:09.910 --> 23:10.998
Rutherford, is he
messing with us?

23:11.041 --> 23:13.087
I think he really did ascend.

23:13.130 --> 23:15.437
Bye, Badgey.
Good luck being everything.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.048
This AI belongs to us.
We claim salvage.

23:18.092 --> 23:20.094
Oh, shut up.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.446
Well, look who it is.

23:24.490 --> 23:27.188
The escape artist,
locked up again.

23:27.231 --> 23:29.233
-Ha, ha, ha, ha.
-Silence!

23:29.277 --> 23:31.932
I'm going to utilize
the therapist's chair

23:31.975 --> 23:33.455
to process my toxic behavior.

23:33.499 --> 23:36.893
Once I'm rehabilitated,
I'll petition for release

23:36.937 --> 23:39.243
and move in with my best friend!

23:39.287 --> 23:41.028
[evil laughter]

23:44.031 --> 23:48.818
Oh, sorry for kidnapping you
and taking over that planet.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.516
I guess it's okay.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.256
I just really
could have used intel

23:52.300 --> 23:53.170
on those ships getting attacked.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.563
Oh, that wasn't a lie.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.957
My drone recorded
the entire Bynar theft.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.958
-Theft?
-[tablet chimes]

23:58.001 --> 24:00.003
Whoa, all those ships,

24:00.047 --> 24:01.265
they aren't being destroyed.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.442
-They're being stolen.
-It's all fake?

24:03.485 --> 24:04.965
We got to get this to Starfleet.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.488
Thanks, Agimus.

24:06.532 --> 24:10.405
Do you think you can teach me
how to be friendly, too?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.103
I don't know, Tyrannikillicus,

24:13.147 --> 24:15.192
but I can try.

24:15.236 --> 24:18.892
RUTHERFORD:
Okey dokey, shuttle
grappler test 86.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.459
You've got this.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.156
See, we could have done
the crate thing earlier, right?

24:22.199 --> 24:23.592
Here we go.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.986
Aah! Wow!

24:26.029 --> 24:27.466
Did you see how close that was?

24:27.509 --> 24:29.119
That was so much better
than last time, Rutherford.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.426
Thanks. I added
an AI guidance system.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.776
-It really helps.
-[laughter]

24:33.820 --> 24:35.299
[gasps]
You brought that thing home?

24:35.343 --> 24:36.562
Can I teach you a lesson?

24:36.605 --> 24:38.215
Hey, don't worry,
this isn't Badgey.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.174
It's Goodgey.
He's the guidance system.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.002
Woohoo!
[giggles]

24:42.045 --> 24:44.526
Uh, Rutherford, is this guy
going to murder us?

24:44.570 --> 24:47.050
Nah, he's cool.
Right, Goodgey?

24:47.094 --> 24:49.444
You know it.
Let me help with...

24:50.924 --> 24:52.142
[whimpering]

24:53.796 --> 24:55.581
I'm Goodgey.
[laughs]

24:55.624 --> 24:58.061
Ha-ha, see?
Goodgey's good.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.151
Um, yeah, so I'm gonna leave.

25:01.195 --> 25:02.544
Yeah, let's-let's get out
of here.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.155
But, Mariner, Tendi,
get me down. Don't leave me.

25:05.199 --> 25:07.070
-Hand me that stem bolt?
-[chuckles]

25:07.114 --> 25:08.463
GOODGEY:
Sure thing, Father.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.595
RUTHERFORD:
You can call me Rutherford.

25:09.638 --> 25:11.118
GOODGEY:
Works for me.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.207
BOIMLER:
Guys, I don't want to be here.
