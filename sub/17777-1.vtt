00:18.285 --> 00:25.090
(chorus music)

00:47.214 --> 00:51.250
- [VOICEOVER] Around the world LA
is viewed as the land of dreams.

(chorus music)

00:58.526 --> 01:05.297

Surf, sun,

01:16.077 --> 01:19.411
Hollywood, Rodeo Drive.

01:20.448 --> 01:24.616
Fame, glamour, and movie stars.

01:24.618 --> 01:31.757
(hip hop music)

01:31.759 --> 01:35.360
I call LA the Big Facelift.

01:37.598 --> 01:42.267
Before all the homes with
their fine trimmed lawns

01:42.269 --> 01:44.503
and their golf courses,

01:44.505 --> 01:46.638
and their high rises...

01:48.843 --> 01:50.742
this place was a desert.

01:53.147 --> 01:58.650
(hip hop music)
(waves crashing)

01:58.652 --> 02:00.786
What you see isn't all there is.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.657
In LA, you don't
have to be cool.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.393
You just have to
act like you are.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.830
Don't take anything
at face value.

02:11.832 --> 02:14.900
Here, image is king.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.369
(hip hop music)

02:26.914 --> 02:29.214
The people who run the show,

02:29.216 --> 02:31.884
that make the rules,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.554
that have the education,

02:36.891 --> 02:38.857
are no more moral

02:38.859 --> 02:40.939
than the guy rummaging
through your trash

02:41.562 --> 02:43.795
looking for cans and bottles.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.735
(hip hop music)

02:49.737 --> 02:52.938
They just have a way of
making it sound like they are,

02:52.940 --> 02:55.707
and then they end up
buying their own bullshit

02:55.709 --> 02:59.645
and con themselves into
believing they are.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.948
The packaging is more
important than the product.

(helicopter whirring)

03:30.945 --> 03:33.545
(panting)

03:36.717 --> 03:39.985
Consider the state's
three strike law.

03:41.255 --> 03:45.424
One the outside it sounds
pretty fair, like baseball.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.659
Three chances and you're out.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.530
Of course, that
depends on what side

03:51.532 --> 03:53.398
of the street you were born.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.636

04:27.468 --> 04:30.535
(police siren wailing)

04:31.572 --> 04:32.804
Juan!

04:38.512 --> 04:39.778
Juan!

04:39.780 --> 04:40.979
(speaking Spanish)

04:42.549 --> 04:43.615
- Juan!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.317
What happened, Juanito?

04:45.319 --> 04:46.685
Talk to me, Juan.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.819
(whimpering)

04:47.821 --> 04:49.521
Juan?

04:51.458 --> 04:52.491
(screams)

04:52.493 --> 04:53.959
- Hands, hands!

04:53.961 --> 04:55.627
(dramatic music)
- What's going on?

04:55.629 --> 04:58.463
- Talk to me Juan!
- [Officer] Hey, back away.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.599
Back away from the door!
Back away!

05:02.303 --> 05:04.336
- [Angie] What's going on?

05:04.338 --> 05:05.504
- [Officer] Stay calm, stay calm.
- [Angie] He's my brother.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.306
Juan?
Juanito?

05:07.308 --> 05:08.340
(dramatic music)

05:08.342 --> 05:11.043
(voice drowned out by music)

05:30.964 --> 05:32.531
(police siren wails)

05:34.601 --> 05:36.601
- [Juan] It's the truth,
that's what happened.

05:36.603 --> 05:40.072
(sobbing)

05:55.823 --> 05:57.589
- Come on, bro, tell me,
tell me what happened.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.959
- It's the truth
that's what happened.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.362
- You put yourself on
my side of the table,

06:03.364 --> 06:06.732
and you listen,
listen to your story,

06:06.734 --> 06:08.633
and then you take into
consideration that the bank

06:08.635 --> 06:12.371
payroll and the second
suspect are still at large.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.739
- But you know me.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.577
- I thought I knew
your uncle Manny, too.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.679
That was a long time ago.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.982
- Please, Jimmy,
I don't want to lie to you.

06:32.659 --> 06:33.892
- Well it wouldn't
be the first time

06:33.894 --> 06:36.728
I was wrong about
somebody either.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.665
- I'm sorry, but what can I say?

06:40.667 --> 06:43.101
It's the truth.
I swear to you.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.042
- I understand...

06:52.613 --> 06:56.114
but I don't know
if anybody else will.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.884
(speaking Spanish)

06:58.886 --> 07:01.119
(sobbing)

07:28.782 --> 07:30.182
- Pop the trunk.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.123
Come on out.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.701
Here, you hold this letter.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.236
- That's a pretty nice jacket.
- Shut up.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.705
Mail this letter over there.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.788
(girls giggling)

08:09.790 --> 08:11.490
- [Girl] He thinks he's Kobe.

08:11.492 --> 08:12.757
- [Girl 2] But he's cute.

08:12.759 --> 08:13.925

09:08.982 --> 09:11.917
(alarm blaring)

09:31.772 --> 09:34.072

I'm a ghost.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.740
- Shh.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.909
I don't have time for that.

09:37.911 --> 09:41.913
Manny is gone,
but you me, mama, Diana,

09:41.915 --> 09:43.949
we're still a family.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.852
- What does Diana think?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.354
- She misses you.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.724
She's curious.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.125
I'm just trying
to find an opportunity

09:54.127 --> 09:56.895
to tell her in the best way.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.897
Let's talk about you.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.600
- Fucking public lawyer said they
can blame me for Manny's death.

10:01.602 --> 10:02.867
- And?

10:02.869 --> 10:06.071
- They say I can
get a better deal.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.006
If I rat myself out.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.910
- We need to find
someone who cares.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.646
- Why don't you get one of those
lawyers that work with you?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.348
- They're contract lawyers.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.315
It's complicated.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.919
(buzzer buzzing)

10:20.921 --> 10:22.887
Look I don't have
time to explain.

10:22.889 --> 10:27.926
Did Manny ever mention a
lawyer named... Alan Hartford?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.928
- No I don't think so.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.262
- I found his card
in Manny's wallet.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.281
You sure you don't know him.

10:33.282 --> 10:35.299
- I only know two things,
Manny's wallet and the lawyer.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.136
And you need to
get him for me now.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.274
(dramatic music)

10:43.276 --> 10:44.843
- [Manny] You can't
understand what you fear

10:44.845 --> 10:49.114
by labeling it and
putting it in a box.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.851
Any fool who's been to the zoo,

10:52.853 --> 10:54.319
can see an animal in the cage

10:54.321 --> 10:56.888
is less than half of what it is.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.724
(dramatic music)

11:02.763 --> 11:04.863
You'll never know a man's heart,

11:04.865 --> 11:07.432
when you first rob
him of his youth.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.236
- [Man] Otherwise driving
the get away car.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.305
He's related
to the registered owner,

11:14.307 --> 11:17.142
deceased Manny Garcia,

11:17.144 --> 11:21.179
so a car jack defense
is implausible.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.682
Had some priors as well,

11:23.684 --> 11:25.817
mostly minors, but...

11:25.819 --> 11:28.319
enough to destroy wrong time,
wrong place defense.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.855
- You have to understand,
he's just a kid.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.091
- The law regards
him as an adult.

11:33.093 --> 11:37.395
The county has a 78%
conviction rate for jury trials

11:37.397 --> 11:40.265
plus 93% when you
factor in plea bargains.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.300
- Sounds like you
don't want the case.

11:42.302 --> 11:45.770
- This deck is stacked.
If you expected to win.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.906
No lawyer in their right
mind would want the case.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.808
- [Angie] How much do I
owe you for your time.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.309
- Angie, please sit down.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.977
- Really, Mr. Hartford.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.412
- Please call me Alan.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.846
- Look, Alan, I don't
want to waste your time.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.184
- Angie, I'm just
trying to be honest.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.386
Ms. Garcia,

12:01.388 --> 12:07.392
could you please just
sit down for a moment.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.294
Please.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.330
- Angie.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.375
- As I told you, your uncle
was a client of mine

12:24.377 --> 12:26.444
and though I never
knew him a a friend,

12:26.446 --> 12:28.980
I did find him to be
a man of his word.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.982
Frankly, the news
of his involvement

12:30.984 --> 12:32.917
in this bank robbery shocks me.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.220
- It's a simple case of relapse.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.088
- I don't think
it's that simple.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.257
- Once a criminal
always a criminal.

12:39.259 --> 12:43.495
You'd understand that if you
lived where I lived, Alan.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.298
- Tell me you understand this.

12:49.035 --> 12:53.505
It's a $10,000 retainer
from your Uncle Manny.

12:55.375 --> 12:59.410
Postmarked on
the day of the robbery.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.218
I believe your brother's story.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.391
- But I thought you said
no one in their right mind

13:13.393 --> 13:15.093
would want this case.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.428
- When I went to bat
for your Uncle Manny,

13:17.430 --> 13:20.965
he was facing his third strike,
a life behind bars.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.501
Manny walked out of state
in less than 11 months.

13:23.503 --> 13:26.337
(dramatic music)

14:21.628 --> 14:23.494
- Hi Juan.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.330
I'm Alan Hartford,

14:25.332 --> 14:27.999
your sister Angie has
retained me to represent you.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.234
- Yeah I know.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.174
- An unusual series
of events and circumstances

14:36.176 --> 14:38.409
has thrown us together,
and I'm believing,

14:38.411 --> 14:42.180
knowing your uncle,
for a good reason.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.317
Now, you're preliminary
hearing is tomorrow.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.519
- Are they gonna ask
me any questions?

14:48.521 --> 14:50.221
- The prosecution
will call certain

14:50.223 --> 14:53.258
witnesses to testify
in front of the judge.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.060
Take it easy.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.463
I won't be calling you or any
of our potential witnesses

14:58.465 --> 15:00.098
to testify at any of the prelim.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.633
- These mother fuckers are
gonna ring me up like...

15:01.635 --> 15:04.602
- A prelim is only so
the judge can decide

15:04.604 --> 15:09.107
if there's enough evidence
to actually have a trial.

15:09.109 --> 15:12.043
Now, you don't have many priors.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.914
A couple of FI cards but,
no convictions.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.181
- FI?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.986
- You ever tell the
cops who you ran with?

15:21.988 --> 15:24.105
- Yeah.

15:24.106 --> 15:26.223
- You see them filling out these
little green cards while you talked?

15:26.226 --> 15:29.494
- Yeah, but that
was a long time ago.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.329
- How long?

15:31.331 --> 15:34.666
- Like four or five years ago.
Like when I was 12.

15:34.668 --> 15:38.202
Did I mess up?
- Not as bad as I have.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.472
Look, Manny was a solid dude.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.441
I respected him, we got to worry

15:43.443 --> 15:45.677
about your ass right now, okay?

15:45.679 --> 15:47.478
- I told them fools,
I don't know shit.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.213
My Uncle Manny
said I could drive.

15:49.215 --> 15:53.451
(hip hop music)
(grunting loudly)

15:56.323 --> 15:59.390
- You'll get 20
years for this punk.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.566
- Juan, is someone at the door?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.401
- It's just me.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.303
(keys jingling)

16:20.213 --> 16:22.981
(car beeping)

16:24.050 --> 16:25.550
- You're the baddest actor ever.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.186
- Shut up man, that
was a piece of shit.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.989
- No way, that's the
greatest flick I ever seen.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.623
- Shut up, come on let's go.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.326
- I told you, dick,
I don't have my license yet.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.996
- So what, come on let's go.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.409
- You said honor
always comes first.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.078
- Never mind what I said,
just listen to me now.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.580
- When you get respect?

16:55.582 --> 16:58.750
- Respect and winning at life
are two different things.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.318
- Well, the homies they're in.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.754
- Hey look, you go in,
you never get out.

17:02.756 --> 17:05.022
Make a right here.

17:06.291 --> 17:09.193
Angie, your mom, Diana,
that's your family.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.563
Fifth Street Muertos
preach brotherhood,

17:12.565 --> 17:14.298
us against them.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.534
That's all bullshit unless
you're in the joint.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.270
And them guys preaching,
they're all lifers.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.672
So they ain't got nothing to do.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.207
The most important thing to them

17:23.209 --> 17:25.108
is having a little
money on their books

17:25.111 --> 17:27.345
or some homegirl to write em.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.614
They're just using us.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.649
And I'm going back
there to be with them.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.151
- I don't understand.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.420
- I've been a criminal
all my life.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.121
And they're not
letting me forget it.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.057
- But you're an actor now.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.793
- I'm not an actor, I'm just
playing the thug that I am.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.529
(hip hop music)

17:46.399 --> 17:48.433
They say I gave up big
secrets to get that part

17:48.435 --> 17:52.370
in "Gang of Five,"
and they wanted a piece of it.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.305
That's just their angle
to keep me in.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.307
(hip hop music)

17:56.309 --> 17:59.744
Smile boy,
your uncle's got a plan.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.113
It's your big day
behind the wheel.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.381
(farting)

18:03.383 --> 18:06.250
That shit smells sweet.
(laughing)

18:08.321 --> 18:10.221
Booyah.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.658
- I know he's a good kid.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.493
But he's got the FI cards,

18:15.495 --> 18:19.163
the field identification
cards from several years back.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.365
A long time ago, I know
he still isn't innocent.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.635
But it's almost a moot point.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.505
He claims allegiance
to the Muertos which,

18:27.507 --> 18:30.308
fortunately is consistent
with his only tattoo.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.276
- [Angie] You have to
understand, he's just a kid.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.178
- I understand, but
that little green card

18:34.180 --> 18:38.416
leads to a very big word, gang.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.551
(hip hop music)

18:44.491 --> 18:46.691
- [Uncle Manny]
Choices, choices.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.461
Where I grew up,
the way I grew up,

18:50.463 --> 18:53.631
my future looked as bright
as the bottom of a well.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.767
(hip hop music)

18:56.769 --> 19:00.204
A slave cutting
someone else's lawn.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.906
Cleaning someone else's toilet.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.243
Breaking my back to put food
on someone else's table.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.311
And in the end for what?

19:07.313 --> 19:09.714
Someone else's table scraps.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.851
Me, I made the only
logical choice.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.921
Live for today.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.856
(gun firing)

19:18.858 --> 19:21.459
(whooshing)

19:24.364 --> 19:26.497
All that matters is now.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.433
(hip hop music)

19:36.309 --> 19:37.286
- [Juan] What's up man?

19:37.287 --> 19:38.264
- [Bouncer] Where you going man?

19:38.265 --> 19:39.242
- I'm going with Harvey, dawg.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.212
- I can't let you in, dawg.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.580
Sorry man, I can't let you in.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.748
- Fuck, homey.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.488
- Hey.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.425
You're cute.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.394
(hip hop music)

19:56.396 --> 19:59.597
(laughing and chatter)

19:59.599 --> 20:02.533
(hip hop music)

20:25.425 --> 20:26.624
- Get out!

20:26.626 --> 20:28.326
- Get they fuck out
(speaking Spanish).

20:28.328 --> 20:30.795
(hip hop music)

20:42.976 --> 20:44.508

20:46.279 --> 20:48.412
- Hey, foo', check it out,

20:48.414 --> 20:49.680
I think she likes you.

20:49.681 --> 20:50.947
- Naw, Ace,
she just laughs at you.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.251
- Dig, she was laughing at you.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.452
Go over there and talk to her

20:54.454 --> 20:55.820
if you gonna be
a pussy about it.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.389
- I will, foo',
the night is still young.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.958
Plus I got a lot
of catching up to do, homes.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.595
What the fuck?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.731
(laughing)

21:06.733 --> 21:07.832
(speaking Spanish)

21:07.834 --> 21:11.369
(unintelligible)

21:11.371 --> 21:12.603
- I don't know foo',
but that fool

21:12.605 --> 21:13.904
got all the hoes
standing in line.

21:13.906 --> 21:16.307
- Javier?
- Yeah.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.475
He must have hit
the lottery or something.

21:17.477 --> 21:18.909
- No foo' that inking.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.811
That's what get

21:20.813 --> 21:22.313
(whistling)

21:22.315 --> 21:24.015
- Oh, Adolf is calling us.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.619
- What's the scene, Javi?
What's up.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.621
- These are my boys.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.056
You know Juan don't you?

21:32.058 --> 21:33.324
- No.

21:33.325 --> 21:34.591
- Sure you do,
you know Manny right?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.761
That's his little nephew.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.597
- You're Manny's nephew?

21:39.599 --> 21:41.499
You don't look
like him, schoolboy.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.968
- Yeah he got a lot
of catching up to do.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.537
Shit but you gone be losing

21:58.651 --> 22:02.820
- Man, I'm a get Marty

22:02.822 --> 22:05.456
Before you get the stinky,
you got to get the inky first.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.558
(laughing)

22:17.770 --> 22:18.903
- Damn, woman.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.606
Those are some nice papusas.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.109
Damn.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.031
Baby don't do that

22:28.981 --> 22:31.482
That's new.
Sukiyaki style, baby.

22:31.484 --> 22:36.754
(speaking Spanish).

22:36.756 --> 22:38.055
Damn.

22:42.462 --> 22:45.129
(car approaching)

22:50.636 --> 22:52.403
- Hey, Ama.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.138
(car door slams)

22:54.140 --> 22:55.973
- [Mama] Hello, mijita.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.508
- [Diana] Hey, Grandma.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.510
- (groans) How was school?

22:59.512 --> 23:03.114
- [Girl] Fine. We claydoughed
and played cooking.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.915
- Is Juan home?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.952
- Yes, he got home
about half an hour ago.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.453
- [Angie] Juan!

23:11.557 --> 23:12.990
Juan!

23:15.661 --> 23:17.561
Tell Juan I need
to speak with him,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.697
not to go out anywhere tonight.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.182
- He's not home?

23:21.183 --> 23:22.666
- [Angie] No it seems
he disappeared again.

23:22.668 --> 23:23.901
- [Mama] Is something wrong?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.637
- I have to go into
class a little earlier,

23:26.639 --> 23:27.972
so I'll see you guys
later, okay?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.106
Be good.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.841
- [Girl] Okay, mommy.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.575
Can I have a cookie?
- Yes, you know where they are.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.545
I'll be in in a minute.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.665
(screaming)

23:54.667 --> 23:56.867
- Do you have a three?

23:56.869 --> 23:59.003
Oh...
Yes.

23:59.005 --> 24:00.704
- I win, I win, I win.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.573
- Not fair, not fair, I had you.

24:02.575 --> 24:05.709
- I'm the bestest.
Right, Grandma?

24:05.711 --> 24:07.178
- Yes. My princess
are the bestest.

24:07.180 --> 24:10.080
- (Groaning) Ma call a doctor.

24:10.082 --> 24:12.616
- You need medicine
big or small.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.051
- [Juan] Big.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.654
- Andale, Doctor, Adele.
Looks like he's a goner.

24:16.656 --> 24:18.022
(laughing)

24:18.024 --> 24:19.890
You remind me so much
of your Uncle Manny.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.692
Yup.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.661
Do you see anyone else here?

24:23.663 --> 24:24.995
Call him.

24:24.997 --> 24:29.133
Maybe I should say
the way he used to be.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.602
(groaning)

24:38.244 --> 24:40.044
You done it again, Doc.

24:40.046 --> 24:40.978
Thank you.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.646
- See grandma I saved him.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.549
- You'll be
the best doctor ever.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.485
- [Girl] Can we play dolls now?

24:47.487 --> 24:49.587
- Mm-hmm, go on and set
them up, I'll be right in.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.689
- On my bed?
- Mm-hmm.

24:55.228 --> 24:57.261
- Mama?
- Hmm?

24:57.263 --> 24:59.630
- What do you mean
he used to be?

24:59.632 --> 25:02.833
- Your Uncle Manny was
your Aunt Helen's guardian.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.002
Oh he loved taking care of her.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.172
He used to have little games,
just like you and Danita.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.907
Good thing too
huh, cause I wanted

25:09.909 --> 25:12.843
nothing to do with your tia.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.178
I was so boy crazy.

25:14.180 --> 25:17.214
Pendeja.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.750
- Was that right
after your mom died?

25:19.752 --> 25:23.854
- Yes, thank goodness
for your Uncle Manny.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.024
He was only 16 years old then,
your age,

25:27.026 --> 25:30.528
but it was as if he knew
what your Tia Lynn needed.

25:30.530 --> 25:32.530
And he wasn't much into
fighting back them.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.833
- Now that's hard to believe.
- It's true.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.835
He was a really sensitive boy.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.837
He would even help
our mother cook

25:39.839 --> 25:42.640
when he saw that she was
really tired after work.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.209
And he didn't even care that
our father would tease him.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.212
- Mama, Manny really?

25:48.214 --> 25:49.780
- Really.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.750
- So what happened?

25:54.554 --> 25:57.254
- This is a tough barrio,
mi hijo.

25:57.256 --> 25:58.923
You know that.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.892
And your Uncle Manny
would get beat up.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.895
He'd come home with
tears in his eyes.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.598
And then your
grandfather would beat

26:07.600 --> 26:10.200
him up again for crying.

26:10.202 --> 26:15.172
(speaking Spanish)

26:18.778 --> 26:20.878
- What's the matter?

26:20.880 --> 26:23.714
- I just get mad at myself
for not doing anything.

26:23.716 --> 26:26.884
- He's drunk, he's still
(speaking Spanish).

26:26.886 --> 26:28.252
Forget about that.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.090
So what happened with Manny?

26:33.092 --> 26:34.758
What changed him?

26:35.995 --> 26:39.930
- Your Uncle Manny,
mi hijo, was fast

26:39.932 --> 26:42.967
and he would always run away.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.870
One day your
grandfather caught him.

26:46.872 --> 26:50.074
Manny was crunched
down on the floor.

26:50.076 --> 26:54.144
And your abuelo punched
and punched and punched.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.781
Your tio curled himself
up into a little ball

26:57.783 --> 26:59.817
and covered himself
with his arms.

26:59.819 --> 27:02.820
He never fought
back, and he just

27:02.822 --> 27:05.756
punched and punched and punched.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.095
Manny's arms got so bruised,

27:11.097 --> 27:13.864
he couldn't
hold them up anymore.

27:15.201 --> 27:20.738
And when they fell to
his side, he didn't stop.

27:26.278 --> 27:30.981
His face, I'll never forget it.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.117
I couldn't recognize him.

27:34.220 --> 27:39.957
The stitches,
he looked like Frankenstein.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.694
(dramatic music)

27:47.166 --> 27:50.901
(speaking Spanish)

27:51.971 --> 27:53.103
(sobbing)

27:53.105 --> 27:55.839
We're all going
to be alright, mi hijo.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.241
Shh.

28:02.848 --> 28:06.016
- [Manny] Life is a game,
but there are rules.

28:06.018 --> 28:09.219
(people playing)

28:09.221 --> 28:12.890
Rules are supposed
to make the game fair.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.027
Second place don't mean shit.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.931
So that winning becomes
the only thing that matters.

28:23.169 --> 28:26.937
Then life becomes about
bending and breaking the rules.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.811
(crowd cheering)

28:34.447 --> 28:35.979
- Yeah.

28:35.981 --> 28:38.482
(grunting)

28:38.484 --> 28:39.784
- Hey, hey, back up.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.085
- You lost the
battle, you keep this

28:41.086 --> 28:42.386
shit up you're gonna
lose the war too.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.987
- We can go right here right
now, puto.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.422
Right the fuck now.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.825
- Come on Smiley, what you got?

28:47.827 --> 28:49.259
Come on.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.263
- You only right 'cause
you got a badge, pussy.

28:53.265 --> 28:55.132
- Best get to getting.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.266
- Bye, Smiley.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.169
(people chatting)

29:04.143 --> 29:07.111
- Thugs like that are only
dangerous amongst the pack.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.946
All bark and no bite.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.419
You ever seen or smelled
that scumbag before?

29:15.421 --> 29:16.420
- Naw.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.522
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:18.524 --> 29:20.124
- The way he was
riding you all game,

29:20.126 --> 29:21.492
I thought you guys
had some history.

29:21.494 --> 29:24.161
- He's gonna be history, dude.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.166
- Maybe he's just sweating
over our best player.

29:29.168 --> 29:32.803
- Thanks, bro, but you
still got game, old man.

29:32.805 --> 29:35.939
- Well, at least my
jimmy still works.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.376
But you, bro,
you were born to play point.

29:39.378 --> 29:43.380
- Not born, just taught
by a pretty cool coach.

29:44.450 --> 29:46.850
- I'm telling you,
try out again.

29:46.852 --> 29:51.822
So you took a year off,
they could use you at point.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.924
- I'm not into
this shit anymore.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.226
You know, I'm tired of people
telling me what to do.

29:56.228 --> 29:59.129
All right?
- All right.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.232
All right.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.102
I'm sorry, you're right.
I'm gonna shut up.

30:05.971 --> 30:10.140
I just like having
you back out here, bro.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.242
It's good to have you back.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.845
- Back home.
It feels good.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.481
- Being part
of a team always does.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.982
- [Man] Hey, Sarge!

30:18.984 --> 30:21.018
- That's why these
chumps will be playing

30:21.020 --> 30:23.420
for second place all day long.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.222
- All right let's go, d-up,
d-up, you check him out.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.825
Let's go, let's go.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.295
- Hey school boy.
- Hey working girl.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.130
- That's cold.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.265
(speaking Spanish)

30:35.267 --> 30:37.868
- [Coach] Come on it's
tip off time playa.

30:37.870 --> 30:42.339
- Just count me out coach.
- Better get going.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.007
[Unintelligible]

30:44.009 --> 30:46.210
- Never knew you
were such a stud.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.178
Nice moves out there.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.480
- You ain't seen nothing.
I'm better one on one.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.383
- [Coach] Come on, Juan.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.619
- Are you gonna be
at the mall tonight?

30:55.621 --> 30:57.287
- Better make it quick.

30:57.289 --> 31:00.557
I have some other things
for a girl like me to do.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.093
- Come on, youngster.
Let's go man.

31:03.095 --> 31:07.097
Okay here we go.
Hold up! LAPD is in the house.

31:07.099 --> 31:10.601
(hip hop music)

31:10.603 --> 31:12.569
Hey, yo, give me the rock!

31:12.571 --> 31:15.005
Let's go!
Let's go!

31:39.231 --> 31:41.164
- Yo!

31:41.166 --> 31:43.100
Let's go!

31:44.136 --> 31:47.137
Hey!
Come on, Juan!

31:47.139 --> 31:48.572
Yo, what's up?

32:00.619 --> 32:03.387
(Clapping)

32:05.291 --> 32:07.257
Come on, James!

32:11.397 --> 32:13.563
- Time, time, time.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.402
- 51-50, 51-50.
- Gotcha.

32:18.404 --> 32:22.339
- Listen this is
the ball, not her ass.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.474
Can't you see she's
just playing you.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.009
Come on, pick at the top
of the key.

32:26.011 --> 32:29.079
You got that shot,
you take it. Come on.

32:29.081 --> 32:31.415
Alright, ball in. Ball in.
- Ball in.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.553
(crowd cheering)

32:49.501 --> 32:51.268
(crowd cheering)

33:08.520 --> 33:11.221
- Can I give you a lift?
- Naw I'm all right.

33:11.223 --> 33:12.723
- You kicked some ass, bro.

33:12.725 --> 33:16.159
You didn't need us out there,
you don't need her either.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.363
- Hey you're in line
to be the man.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.198
- Young stud.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.100
-Stay up, dawg.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.668
- Bring us some donuts.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.204
- I'll take a bran muffin.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.339
- You sure I can't
give you a lift?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.575
- Naw I'm alright,
I'll catch up later.

33:45.657 --> 33:48.291
- Come on. Hurry up, puto. We
have a lot of catching up to do.

33:48.293 --> 33:51.194
- Yeah homes I heard Rosa's
throwing a party, we should go.

33:51.196 --> 33:53.196
- Man you and I both
know there's no way in hell

33:53.198 --> 33:54.698
we're getting into that party.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.300
- Maybe you two can't get
in but I know I can get in.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.303
- This one wants to go all
the way to Rosa's house

34:00.305 --> 34:02.105
to a party that we
may not even get into.

34:02.107 --> 34:03.640
- You're a stupid ass fool.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.143
- We're already have beers.
We just kick it

34:06.145 --> 34:08.277
with the homies and
get a little 10 sack.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.679
- (Knocking)
- Oh shit.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.449
- Don't get scared, fucker.
I'm not your mom, fool.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.353

34:25.431 --> 34:26.763
(laughing)

34:26.764 --> 34:29.132
(hip hop music)

34:40.612 --> 34:42.379
- You're be more on top of girls

34:42.380 --> 34:44.214
when you get your
fucking tattoo.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.683
- [Juan] Hey you guys don't
want to smoke or what?

34:46.685 --> 34:49.619
- Hey that's all you,
don't even trip on it.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.121
Once you get to the strip club,

34:51.123 --> 34:52.556
you'll see what
real bitches are.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.157
(hip hop music)

34:56.195 --> 34:58.762
(cat calling)

34:59.531 --> 35:02.299
(hip hop music)

35:43.175 --> 35:45.509
- You like that huh?
- Shit hell yeah.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.814
Veritas, homies.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.885
(hip hop music)

36:09.868 --> 36:14.304
(tattoo needle whirring)
(pop music)

36:25.918 --> 36:29.419
- All right, I'm a take
a quick smoke break.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.821
I'll be back in a little
while to finish you guys up.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.391
- All right do your thing.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.761
Hold that mother fucker in,
you know that shit hurt.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.263
(laughing)
- You little bitch.

36:41.366 --> 36:45.202
- Let me check this out.
I like that shit.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.444
Don't cry, stupid asshole.
What's up right there?

36:51.210 --> 36:54.511
Ya, next stop, coochie town.

36:54.513 --> 36:57.447
- You know what foo, we're
gonna be the next generation.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.416
Walk tall or don't walk at all.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.485
- Last man standing, baby, show
what you got. Marco for life.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.821
Los tres amigos riding
proud and riding high.

37:12.764 --> 37:16.499
(speaking Spanish)

37:16.501 --> 37:17.834
Wait up.
Wait up.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.537
- What happened, who that?

37:20.539 --> 37:23.306
I don't know what happened.
What's up with this one?

37:23.308 --> 37:26.710
- Man, what the fuck.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.445
Not now, man.

37:28.447 --> 37:30.580
Know what I'm saying, dawg.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.882
All right.
It's Manny, man. It's my bad.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.551
Homie, 911.

37:34.553 --> 37:38.488
Bounce homey, my bad,
catch you guys later man.

37:38.490 --> 37:39.789
- Glad you answered
your phone, dawg.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.358
- [Juan] Yeah man.

37:43.795 --> 37:46.162
- [Passenger] Look.

37:46.163 --> 37:48.530
- Ya what's up. That mother fucker
just flaked out on us, dawg.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.433
- [Passenger] Got him.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.704
- You know what to do dawg, get
back to me later, all right.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.941
(helicopter whirring)

38:05.284 --> 38:08.018
(hip hop music)

38:45.924 --> 38:48.825
- Fucking pigs.
- Relax.

38:48.827 --> 38:51.861
Think about it,
if we smoke this little punk,

38:51.863 --> 38:54.631
shit's gonna hit the fan homey.

38:54.633 --> 38:58.368
Better to keep Manny in the
pocket, you know what I'm saying?

39:03.775 --> 39:05.942
I got a plan, homey.

39:05.944 --> 39:07.911
I got a plan.

39:07.913 --> 39:09.746
Let's go.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.057
- Perfect form,
two dribbles, one point.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.894
I think I can take
credit for that.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.663
- [Juan] What are
you doing here?

39:26.665 --> 39:27.964
- I'm working.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.632
What are you doing?

39:29.634 --> 39:31.835
- Nothing.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.937
- Reconsidering what I said
about joining the team?

39:33.939 --> 39:38.375
- Yeah.
- Such enthusiasm.

39:38.377 --> 39:41.077
- Naw really.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.746
- You know it's not
such a bad thing,

39:42.748 --> 39:44.447
not being able to lie well.

39:44.449 --> 39:46.383
- I wasn't trying to.
- I know.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.019
Girl troubles.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.821
- Maybe.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.723
- You remember when
I asked you if you knew

39:53.725 --> 39:55.625
them bangers in the stands?

39:55.627 --> 39:57.994
- Yeah.
- Well, they're Muertos.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.563
Not from here.
Higher up like your uncle.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.632
She's their property.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.968
- What is it with you and Manny?

40:04.970 --> 40:07.771
(dramatic music)

40:08.940 --> 40:12.475
- There's some things in life
you can walk away from.

40:12.477 --> 40:13.943
Not them.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.513
- I'm tired of people
telling me what to do.

40:16.515 --> 40:19.048
Advice, advice, advice, fuck it.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.487
- You're right.

40:24.489 --> 40:28.625
You're right, who am I
to tell you what to do?

40:28.627 --> 40:31.094
Whether you like it or not,
you're gonna be a man.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.764
And a man is responsible
for his choices.

40:36.501 --> 40:41.137
It's your choice boy,
be a man or a slave.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.176
Choose well.

40:48.046 --> 40:50.914
- Whatevers man.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.062
Be a man or be a slave.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.764
Fuck.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.600
(dramatic music)

41:29.921 --> 41:32.522
- All right, don't even
trip, don't take it personal.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.157
(dramatic music)

42:55.874 --> 42:57.307
- What's this?

42:59.077 --> 43:01.778
Okay cut, cut.

43:04.182 --> 43:07.717
- Okay, let's take 10.

43:07.719 --> 43:11.788
All right, and by 10
that means, you know, not 15.

43:15.894 --> 43:18.761
Ah, Mr. Garcia.
- Call me Manny.

43:18.763 --> 43:22.732
- Okay, Manny, listen you're
a bullshit guy, okay.

43:24.803 --> 43:27.721
And so am I.

43:27.722 --> 43:30.640
And so I feel like I would
be remiss if I didn't tell you

43:30.642 --> 43:33.042
that your character needs
just like way more rage.

43:33.044 --> 43:36.946
Because you're a fucking
street gang killer, right.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.215
Right, okay, so the audience
needs to see his rage

43:39.217 --> 43:41.084
to feel the fear, right.

43:41.086 --> 43:44.087
Okay look, you're standing
toe to toe with your rival,

43:44.089 --> 43:47.290
and you want to intimidate him,
so I need

43:47.292 --> 43:50.193
your arms just flailing wildly.

43:50.195 --> 43:53.262
Maybe some screaming,
maybe some finger poking,

43:53.264 --> 43:55.264
maybe some chest thumping
if you've got it because

43:55.266 --> 43:58.234
the audience can not
experience the fear of you if

43:58.236 --> 44:00.637
you're just standing there
in some silent stare down.

44:00.639 --> 44:03.239
Now I take this time
with you, only because

44:03.241 --> 44:04.974
I think you've got
a lot of potential.

44:04.976 --> 44:08.678
But trust me when I tell you
that if I'm not afraid of you,

44:08.680 --> 44:12.415
the audience isn't gonna be.

44:12.417 --> 44:15.284
- Barking dog's
a dead give away.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.955
Why should I shove or
threaten some punk in my way?

44:18.957 --> 44:23.426
If he disrespects me,
I'm gonna turn him inside out

44:23.428 --> 44:26.162
by taking everything that's
important to him in his life.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.031
Then I'm going to come for him.

44:28.033 --> 44:29.766
And by that time,
he'll be begging me

44:29.768 --> 44:32.802
to put him out of his misery.

44:32.804 --> 44:37.040
Now that's real.
I'm not acting.

44:38.276 --> 44:44.714
Now, get your camera,
get it up close,

44:44.716 --> 44:47.750
and you let me do my stuff.

44:47.752 --> 44:51.154
- Yeah, you're right,
you're the real deal.

44:51.156 --> 44:54.323
That's why I hired you,
okay, okay.

44:54.325 --> 44:59.395
But just do me a favor,
go back to your trailer

44:59.397 --> 45:03.800
and think or rather rehearse
the scene as I said.

45:03.802 --> 45:06.035
Okay just a minute, just
a minute, just a minute.

45:06.037 --> 45:08.104
We're just doing a rehearsal
for the other guy

45:08.106 --> 45:09.872
while the cameras are still
set this way

45:09.874 --> 45:11.374
and I kinda wanna
see how he reacts.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.843
- It's gonna look fake.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.745
- No, no, no,
don't worry about that.

45:15.747 --> 45:17.780
We're gonna reset the cameras
and we're gonna do it

45:17.782 --> 45:20.083
exactly the way you
described it, okay.

45:20.085 --> 45:23.986
So why don't you go off and
come back in 10 minutes.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.388
And we'll shoot it.

45:25.390 --> 45:27.990
Probably about six minutes
now but whatever okay.

45:27.992 --> 45:30.632
Really mean, really
angry, really crazy.

45:31.329 --> 45:32.962
- I guess you straightened
that fool, uncle.

45:32.964 --> 45:36.365
- Yeah some days are
better than others.

45:39.237 --> 45:41.070
- I want you to
reload the whole mag

45:41.072 --> 45:45.274
and run the camera when I
say over the top rehearsal.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.043
That was scary though right.

45:47.045 --> 45:49.112
Too scary for TV, all right.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.814
Juice, I want juice.

45:53.451 --> 45:55.318
- Can't wait till you
straighten Angie out.

45:55.320 --> 45:56.886
You got me off the shots, tio.

45:56.888 --> 45:59.355
- Well she's right sometimes.

45:59.357 --> 46:01.991
She's playing the odds, she's
right more than she's wrong.

46:01.993 --> 46:04.193
- She's always making
noises how me and the homies

46:04.195 --> 46:06.295
are taking a one way
trip to Loserville.

46:06.297 --> 46:07.930
That's bullshit.

46:07.932 --> 46:10.133
This bus, naw this limo
leads to Hollywood pussy.

46:10.135 --> 46:13.536
(laughing)
- Settle down homes.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.838
It's a dog eat dog
world out there.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.474
And without an education you
just howling at the moon.

46:18.476 --> 46:21.010
And you know what happens
when the man gets tired

46:21.012 --> 46:23.312
of hearing you howling.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.448
He puts your ass to sleep.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.090
Nasty little girl.

46:34.092 --> 46:36.826
I'll be there,
don't get started without me.

46:36.828 --> 46:39.829
- What you say about
howling at the moon?

46:39.831 --> 46:41.230
You getting on that?
- Maybe.

46:41.232 --> 46:44.100
- Come on, ese,
you got to learn to share.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.369
- Just know, every woman
wants you to command them.

46:46.371 --> 46:49.038
Weakness never tolerated.

46:49.040 --> 46:54.177
- I get it, confidence.
- And perpetual motion.

46:54.179 --> 46:59.215
Even a shark can't stop
swimming or it'll die.

46:59.217 --> 47:01.350
Now Hollywood and the barrio,
they're different worlds,

47:01.352 --> 47:03.486
but believe me,
they're both shark tanks.

47:03.488 --> 47:07.957
- Me, Norman, and Jose been
doing some swimming, homes.

47:07.959 --> 47:10.393
- What about your sister,
she dating anybody.

47:10.395 --> 47:12.528
She never tells me shit
about what she's doing.

47:12.530 --> 47:15.164
- She got some pretty high
standards, believe it or not.

47:15.166 --> 47:18.534
- That's good.
She's smart.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.436
And that scares dudes.

47:21.472 --> 47:23.105
But she gotta stop
getting down on herself

47:23.107 --> 47:26.509
about getting pregnant
with that white dude.

47:26.511 --> 47:28.110
She's gonna end up
a bitter old woman

47:28.112 --> 47:29.846
if she don't start
having some fun.

47:29.848 --> 47:33.482
(speaking Spanish)

47:33.484 --> 47:35.318
- Yeah but work is good.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.553
- [Juan] I know but I
wanna have some fun too.

47:37.555 --> 47:39.288
- Fine ass coochie too.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.557
(dramatic music)

47:41.559 --> 47:43.526
- Manny.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.595
Like what you done to the place.

47:48.499 --> 47:50.199
- Wait outside.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.635
Ain't no need for that,
we all family.

47:52.637 --> 47:57.173
- Sure homes, it's about
time you got to know us.

48:00.879 --> 48:02.578
- Go get me a soda.

48:02.580 --> 48:04.547
And don't rush.

48:10.488 --> 48:11.954
- I been missing you.

48:11.956 --> 48:14.590
It ain't polite to leave
your family hanging.

48:14.592 --> 48:17.159
- Sure smells like home, homes.

48:17.161 --> 48:18.661
(laughing)

48:18.663 --> 48:21.664
- Always count on
Manny for a laugh.

48:21.666 --> 48:24.133
Even when the shit's
gone hit the fan.

48:24.135 --> 48:26.269
- Or standing downwind.

48:26.271 --> 48:28.938
(laughing)

48:28.940 --> 48:32.408
- You're right, he's the
right man for the job.

48:32.410 --> 48:34.143
- Yep.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.956
- I know you're up there.

48:52.330 --> 48:54.497
I know you're up there.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.946
Pretty smart when you wanna be.

49:09.948 --> 49:11.580
- Only half a point down.

49:11.582 --> 49:13.316
- Add it up
from last year, Juan,

49:13.318 --> 49:15.184
you've gone from
a B to a C student.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.153
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

49:17.155 --> 49:18.354
- If you don't talk to me,

49:18.356 --> 49:19.956
how am I supposed
to help you out.

49:19.958 --> 49:22.658
Can't you see you're
setting up your patterns.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.727
They'll shape everything you do.

49:24.729 --> 49:26.362
They'll shape your whole future.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.730
- The future, the
future, the future!

49:27.732 --> 49:29.615
Who cares!

49:29.616 --> 49:31.499
If you ain't living now,
you ain't ever gone live!

49:31.502 --> 49:34.737
- Sounds like something
your uncle would say.

49:34.739 --> 49:36.572
- So what, what if he's right!

49:36.574 --> 49:39.208
I ain't interesting in breaking
laws for the next 50 years,

49:39.210 --> 49:41.644
watching all
the hot bitches go by.

49:41.646 --> 49:43.379
Wondering where my life
went with a bunch of

49:43.381 --> 49:45.047
(speaking Spanish)

49:45.049 --> 49:47.750
- It's funny,
he shows up a year ago

49:47.752 --> 49:50.186
fresh out of prison,
your grades fall,

49:50.188 --> 49:51.654
you're nowhere to be found.

49:51.656 --> 49:53.589
What's he trying to
do, mentor his protege?

49:53.591 --> 49:56.058
- Bullshit!
You don't know nothing, girl.

49:56.060 --> 49:58.160
All he ever says is don't
do the mistake he did.

49:58.162 --> 50:00.229
He told me to listen to you.

50:00.231 --> 50:01.564
- I can see you're
really listening.

50:01.566 --> 50:02.999
- You're just like
everyone else.

50:03.001 --> 50:04.633
You only know what
you think you see.

50:04.635 --> 50:06.535
- You're young.

50:06.537 --> 50:08.571
I'm just trying to help you out.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.339
- Help me, you don't know me.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.108
You just want me to be like you.

50:12.110 --> 50:14.643
- You're a boy, about
to become a man.

50:14.645 --> 50:17.046
You see you're
uncle, he's a man.

50:17.048 --> 50:20.483
I know he's a type of role
model me and mama could never be

50:20.485 --> 50:22.184
and I know he means well.

50:22.186 --> 50:23.786
But he can't help who he is.

50:23.788 --> 50:27.757
I just don't want his lifestyle
to start rubbing off on you.

50:27.759 --> 50:30.292
And I know you think it
can't happen, but it can.

50:30.294 --> 50:32.561
I'm sorry but until
your grades shape up,

50:32.563 --> 50:34.530
you can't hang out with
Manny on the set anymore.

50:34.532 --> 50:35.765
- What!

50:35.767 --> 50:37.433
- You can chill with
Manny as long as

50:37.435 --> 50:39.068
it's in the right atmosphere.

50:39.070 --> 50:40.386
- Like here?
- Yes.

50:40.387 --> 50:41.703
- What's wrong with me
kicking it at work with him?

50:41.706 --> 50:44.273
- Hollywood is all about money.

50:44.275 --> 50:48.411
They glorify criminals,
violence, sex, and drugs.

50:48.413 --> 50:50.413
They totally misrepresent
our people to be some

50:50.415 --> 50:55.418
uneducated gang banging peasants,
mojados, so on and so on.

50:56.387 --> 50:59.622
Other than prison,
that's the last positive place

50:59.624 --> 51:01.457
to find a role model.

51:03.561 --> 51:05.227

51:38.362 --> 51:40.463

that was Andy.

51:40.465 --> 51:43.399
Okay fellas, don't
forget to tip your girls.

51:43.401 --> 51:46.469
Next up, we got Nightingale.

51:48.706 --> 51:51.140
(hip hop music)

51:51.142 --> 51:52.608
- Record time, homes.

51:54.812 --> 51:56.879
You better not have any enemies

51:56.881 --> 51:58.841
because you're becoming
predictable.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.151
- I used to think
you were funny.

52:02.153 --> 52:04.286
But that was a long time ago.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.589
- Maybe you need a drink.

52:06.591 --> 52:08.724
- I still ain't laughing.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.826
- I'm not joking.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.728
I'll have another.

52:18.402 --> 52:22.805
Call it a condemned
man's last pop

52:22.807 --> 52:25.774
at the nostalgic place
where he become a man.

52:25.776 --> 52:27.610
Salud.

52:30.148 --> 52:31.881
- Where you took your first step

52:31.883 --> 52:35.818
and a 1000 more that could lead
you to only one destination.

52:36.721 --> 52:38.888
Where you arrived.

52:39.824 --> 52:42.558
- Judge not, lest he be judged.

52:45.596 --> 52:47.463
- We had an understanding.

52:49.867 --> 52:52.201
What the matter,
cat got your tongue?

52:53.171 --> 52:55.938
- Only a dreamer would
expect a blind hunting dog

52:55.940 --> 52:58.774
to stop barking or drooling.

52:59.744 --> 53:02.578
- I see everything, punk.

53:02.580 --> 53:07.550
And even a blind dog can smell
shit in his own backyard.

53:08.886 --> 53:13.489
It's just you and me, but you
still better think hard.

53:17.695 --> 53:19.862
What does the script say,
Hollywood?

53:19.864 --> 53:21.964
Or you can't recall?

53:23.334 --> 53:26.268
- You better pay attention
to your cop videos.

53:26.270 --> 53:29.738
Mr. Hollywood's got
his big closeup mañana.

53:29.740 --> 53:36.278
And I don't need no tear
tracks crying over hurting you.

53:37.515 --> 53:40.216
(speaking Spanish)

53:40.218 --> 53:42.952
(hip hop music)

54:10.348 --> 54:12.548
-Shhhh.

54:27.331 --> 54:29.365
- How long have
they been asleep?

54:29.367 --> 54:32.034
- I don't know they started
watching the movie around 8:00.

54:33.938 --> 54:36.505
Mijita it's just his pride.

54:38.542 --> 54:41.777
- Mr. Night owl goes to bed at
8:00, three nights in a row.

54:41.779 --> 54:44.580
It's more than that.

54:45.950 --> 54:48.467
I just don't want
him to hate me.

54:48.468 --> 54:50.985
- He just wants to be a man.
- I want him to be a man too.

54:50.988 --> 54:53.889
I feel like I'm doing
the complete opposite.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.658
- Shh.

54:55.660 --> 54:58.060
- I'm just tired, Ama.

54:58.062 --> 55:02.398
- I know, I know mijita.

55:02.400 --> 55:04.933
And I'm so proud of you.

55:08.439 --> 55:11.907
- Thanks, Ama.
With work and school.

55:11.909 --> 55:14.543
- You're a good
example for Juanito.

55:14.545 --> 55:17.313
- I hope so.

55:17.315 --> 55:19.915
- Why don't I put this away
and you go get some rest.

55:19.917 --> 55:23.619
- No, I have to start
on the sauce tonight.

55:23.621 --> 55:26.689
Can you put Diana to bed.

55:38.602 --> 55:40.402
(dramatic music)

55:43.507 --> 55:46.008
- [Manny] No one knows
what the future will bring.

55:46.010 --> 55:50.746
But we can all see our past.

55:50.748 --> 55:55.117
With all it's joys and
sorrows, triumphs and defeats.

55:56.420 --> 56:00.456
One thing shines bright, family.

56:01.559 --> 56:03.592
When you betray those you love,

56:03.594 --> 56:07.129
you go against the law of blood.

56:09.433 --> 56:11.600
(dishes clanking)

56:48.072 --> 56:50.005
- So how are your grades?

56:52.510 --> 56:54.109
- Dessert?
- Yeah!

56:54.111 --> 56:56.111
- Yes, mijita,
that would be nice.

56:56.113 --> 56:57.579
- Yeah sure.

56:59.784 --> 57:01.717
- So what did your
mama make for us?

57:01.719 --> 57:03.719
- It's a surprise.

57:03.721 --> 57:06.422
- It's a surprise.
- Good I like surprises.

57:08.459 --> 57:09.958
Ohhhh!

57:09.960 --> 57:11.126
- Wow.

57:11.128 --> 57:14.196
- [Mama] Ooh!
- (laughing)

57:15.900 --> 57:18.967
- Oh I'm sorry.
- Thanks a lot.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.769
- You know I'm
sorry for laughing.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.604
- You ought to be ashamed
of yourself Manny.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.706
- It's a natural reaction.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.708
- She's been cooking
all day pobrecita..

57:26.710 --> 57:28.644
- I'm sorry she's upset
but you know what,

57:28.646 --> 57:30.512
I'm not ashamed.

57:30.514 --> 57:32.781
- You don't have
to defend me, Ama.

57:32.783 --> 57:34.116
- Since when was
I attacking you.

57:34.118 --> 57:36.652
- Was it that funny?

57:36.654 --> 57:39.188
- You know what, in case
you haven't noticed,

57:39.190 --> 57:41.223
the air is so thick in here
you can cut it with a knife.

57:41.225 --> 57:43.492
(speaking Spanish)

57:43.494 --> 57:45.594
Is it just me or are you
always this pissed off?

57:45.596 --> 57:47.229
- Just because I
don't smile or laugh

57:47.231 --> 57:48.997
doesn't mean I'm pissed off.

57:48.999 --> 57:50.599
- I didn't even come here to
eat.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.768
- Then why did you come?
- To hang with Juan.

57:54.672 --> 57:57.639
Your rules remember.

57:57.641 --> 57:59.208
Manny...

58:05.583 --> 58:07.783
- [Diana] Let's just
clean up, Grandma.

58:07.785 --> 58:10.752
- Let's clean up.
Come on, baby.

58:15.025 --> 58:17.059
- Can't you get over
yourself for one second

58:17.061 --> 58:18.560
and see what I'm trying to do.

58:18.562 --> 58:19.595
- You know what, go back inside.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.697
- No.
We need to talk.

58:23.100 --> 58:25.634
- Then you better
stop disrespecting me.

58:26.904 --> 58:30.038
- You can't solve the world's
problems with your fist.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.107
- Can't you see I want
what's best for him.

58:32.109 --> 58:34.643
I can teach him things.

58:34.645 --> 58:37.079
- About what.
- About laughing, for one.

58:37.081 --> 58:38.981
- Life's a big joke, huh?

58:40.117 --> 58:43.685
The bottom line is Juan's
grades are suffering.

58:43.687 --> 58:45.854
- And that's my fault?
- Yes it is.

58:45.856 --> 58:47.623
Listen to me.

58:47.625 --> 58:50.659
- No, you think I want
him to be like me?

58:50.661 --> 58:53.929
I wouldn't wish
my life on anyone.

58:53.931 --> 58:56.131
But I didn't have a choice.
- Bullshit.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.534
We all have choices.

58:58.536 --> 59:00.068
- That's easy for you to say.

59:00.070 --> 59:02.037
You're smart, you're beautiful.

59:02.039 --> 59:05.107
- You're smart too.
- Not in books.

59:05.109 --> 59:07.209
- You can't keep
making excuses, tio.

59:07.211 --> 59:10.012
- I'm not.
- Yes you are.

59:10.014 --> 59:13.582
You always are.
- You can't ask for respect.

59:13.584 --> 59:15.217
You have to earn it.

59:15.219 --> 59:17.986
In your world,
you can use your brains.

59:17.988 --> 59:20.989
Here you need your fists.

59:20.991 --> 59:23.325
- Is that the world
you want for Juan?

59:23.327 --> 59:25.093
- Look around, I
didn't ask for this.

59:25.095 --> 59:28.330
- Precisely my point, if we
don't change it then who will?

59:29.900 --> 59:32.301
- What do you want from me?

59:32.302 --> 59:34.703
- Juan needs to see that there's
other ways besides violence.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.138
- You know what, you're a woman.

59:36.140 --> 59:38.807
You don't understand what
it means to be a man.

59:38.809 --> 59:40.876
We're competitive, we compete.

59:40.878 --> 59:43.779
Whether it's with
money or fists.

59:43.781 --> 59:47.616
It's gonna be a long time
before we can compete

59:47.618 --> 59:49.151
in a white man's money world.

59:49.153 --> 59:51.820
- And so you cop out
for the quick route?

59:51.822 --> 59:54.690
Put your fist in the
white man's mouth

59:54.692 --> 59:56.158
for your precious respect.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.161
Is that worth the price?
Jail.

59:59.163 --> 01:00:02.130
- A coward dies
a thousand deaths.

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:05.834
Ask Veritas,
we had two ways out.

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.971
You could either be
a cop or a criminal.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:12.741
And believe me, my way was hard.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.782
Don't worry Mijita, I'm gone.

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.951
(dramatic music)

01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:01.023
- [Manny] On my street,
when you turn the other cheek

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:05.927
all you got was
a matching black eye.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:10.666
Violence was everywhere
in my barrio.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.402
And when I got home
and turned on the TV,

01:01:13.404 --> 01:01:16.104
it was more of the same.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.409
Get your ass kicked enough,

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:23.145
you do whatever you have to,
to make it stop.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:29.051
But it isn't until you join,

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:32.954
you learn your choice affects
all those around you.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.028
Losing those you love,
hurts a thousand times more

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:42.030
than any ass whipping.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:45.200
And you'll sacrifice
anything to make it right.

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.005
- Hey!

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.347
Come on back, putos.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:01.450
(coughing)

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.055
- Hey, wasn't that
Norman and Jose?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.124
I thought they
were your partners.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.961
Hey, if this fight's
about coochie,

01:02:12.963 --> 01:02:15.764
there's plenty
to go around homes.

01:02:15.766 --> 01:02:18.834
Come on look at me
when I talk to you.

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.736
- They say you a rat,

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:23.238
they say you dropped a dime
on the homie.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.240
No way right?

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:27.442
- It all depends
on who you asking.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:30.212
From where I standing,
all I did was tell

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:34.082
a couple of Hollywood producers,
about my life.

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:37.119
And not so much for the coin,

01:02:37.121 --> 01:02:39.020
but to let people know
how shit happens.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:41.123
- The stuff in the movie true?

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:45.861
Shot callers in the joint,
they think I sold out.

01:02:45.863 --> 01:02:48.764
They say I let the man
know about our operation.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.900
I didn't mention no names,
give no details.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:55.837
They think I broke the rules.

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.473
But see they make the rules
to suit themselves.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.776
Just like it is out here.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.779
Whoever's in charge,
makes the rules.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:06.114
- What's gonna happen?

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:08.416
- To me shit, nothing.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:13.922
Anything they throw
at your tio, I can handle.

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:17.492
You did this for me huh?

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.296
You know what I'm
proud of you today

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.498
but I still don't want
you to be like me.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.535
You got to make a better
life for yourself.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.339
(laughing)

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:33.441
You know what,
I'm a' owe you a shirt.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:37.112
Oh man, Juanillo.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.816
Now they own
a piece of you, homes.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.821
(dramatic music)

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.231
- [Manny] We are all hungry
for a life we can't afford.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.434
It's a line from a song,

01:04:01.104 --> 01:04:03.305
but it has nothing
to do with money

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.240
or whether you're rich or poor.

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:12.113
- [Alan] Yo, brother.
- 'Sup, man. How's it going?

01:04:12.115 --> 01:04:14.082
- You're looking at a man
that's been in the desert

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:15.817
a long time looking
for a drink of water.

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:17.551
- Man I'm telling you,
it's good to see you again.

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:20.055
- Is this the bomb?
- It's even better.

01:04:20.057 --> 01:04:22.157
- Cool man, I'm going
to be hitting you up often

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.426
so be ready, buddy.

01:04:28.599 --> 01:04:32.434
- [Manny] Just watch TV,
life is so exciting.

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:37.372
Life is like Disneyland,

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.908
until you turn your TV off.

01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:42.344
- Pop the trunk.

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:48.583
Get out of the car!

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:58.927
Here, mail this over there.
- That's a pretty nice jacket.

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:00.929
- Shut up! Mail this
over there.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:18.146
(car beeping)

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:21.049
♪ The life chose me

01:05:21.051 --> 01:05:22.284
♪ No cameras ♪

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:25.287
(hip hop music)
(alarm blaring)

01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:33.461
- Let's go! Burn up!

01:05:33.463 --> 01:05:35.130
Get the fuck out!
Come on!

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:37.165
(tires screeching)

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:51.413
- [Alan] If Manny could
testify, I could get him off.

01:05:51.415 --> 01:05:53.348
- I don't understand,
Manny's dead.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:56.685
- No prior knowledge,
means no conspiracy

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:58.586
in the commission
of the robbery.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:01.323
- I don't get it.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:03.224
- People versus Michelle Jordan.

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:05.093
Now Michelle,
she's driving her boyfriend

01:06:05.095 --> 01:06:07.062
and a couple of
his friends around.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.997
The boy friend tells
her that they're hungry.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:10.598
Why don't you pull up
to this local restaurant,

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.284
we're going to get
something to eat.

01:06:12.285 --> 01:06:13.969
Keep the car running,
we're going to get it to go.

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:16.404
Well they go in,
they proceed to rob the place.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:18.239
They come running out
and they dive in the car.

01:06:18.241 --> 01:06:20.308
The boyfriend tells
her to punch it.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:24.646
He's the person in authority,
physically dominant

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.215
so she listens.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.551
- You think that was
a part of Manny's plan?

01:06:31.455 --> 01:06:33.521
- I do know that
Manny's gang the Muertos

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.023
had it our for him.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:36.658
Manny's just a decoy
and drawing the heat

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:39.094
so his partner can sneak
out the back with the cash.

01:06:39.096 --> 01:06:41.629
- But why would he put
Juan in that situation?

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:44.232
- Manny was a loose cannon.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:47.602
Didn't think he'd make it
to 30, let alone 40 or 50.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.637
How do you control that?

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:52.574
You go after what he
loves more than himself.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:54.376
It's no secret.

01:06:54.378 --> 01:06:57.112
That's how the lifers in the
joint control the streets.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:07:00.115
- Sergeant Veritas,
he knows all about the Muertos.

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:02.717
When he was just a kid, he lived

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:04.486
right across the street
from Manny.

01:07:04.488 --> 01:07:07.322
I think Manny even dated
his mom or something.

01:07:09.626 --> 01:07:12.327
(Sighs)
- I should have known.

01:07:12.329 --> 01:07:15.563
They're from the
same neighborhood.

01:07:15.565 --> 01:07:18.099
Look this could be good news.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:23.772
I got to get going,

01:07:23.774 --> 01:07:25.573
why don't I walk you
to your car?

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.742
- Thanks for coming
out here to meet me.

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:29.511
Like I said, not a problem.

01:07:29.513 --> 01:07:32.380
I was in the neighborhood
to meet another client anyway.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.083
(dramatic music)

01:08:09.186 --> 01:08:11.453
(snorting loudly)

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.822
- Al, we're approaching
the gates of Heaven.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:50.291
I need a yes or a no
because our offer

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:52.393
is withdrawn at the door.

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:54.429
- For my client, your offer is

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.363
a highway to hell,
devoid of compassion.

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:59.267
- Compassion, it would be
mercy for it's own sake

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:00.835
to reduce this offer
because the facts

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.737
are gonna wipe your boy out.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:04.671
Al, you know
I don't want to do that.

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:07.442
- What's the difference
between five and 10 years.

01:09:07.444 --> 01:09:09.711
In six months he'll
no longer be a boy

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.845
but the product of
society's ignorance.

01:09:11.848 --> 01:09:14.215
- I've always admired
your idealism,

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.885
but your vision is myopic
or at least clouded

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:19.386
by your desire to help this kid.

01:09:19.389 --> 01:09:20.921
Al, this case is solid as stone.

01:09:20.924 --> 01:09:23.625
- You know as well as I do,
if we strike the motion

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:26.694
to compel gang evidence,
your solid-stone case

01:09:26.696 --> 01:09:29.663
will sink into the
swamp it was built on.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.567
- I know you hate when
I speak like a telegram reads,

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.403
but, A, your client was
at the wheel speeding

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:38.273
from the scene with his uncle
who is clearly identified

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:41.176
brandishing his AK in
the bank only moments prior.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:44.746
B, dead uncle, co-conspirator,
the only person

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:47.282
who can corroborate your
client's story is long time

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.084
ortho shot caller.

01:09:49.085 --> 01:09:50.885
C, clients claim of ignorance
lacks credibility

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:53.287
due to uncle's strapping
up with numerous fire arms

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.356
while still in
client's presence.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.825
D, client's motive,
likely financial opportunity

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:00.295
at that crime scene is
a payroll depository

01:10:00.297 --> 01:10:02.177
on that last day of every month.

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:07.669
- You got a future as
a computer generated

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:10.105
automated customer service recorder
if you decide to go that way.

01:10:10.106 --> 01:10:12.540
A, the prelim generated
more questions than answers.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.977
B, the second perp is still
at large with all the cash.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:19.447
C, your IO is just
mailing this one in.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.917
And D, you are scared
shitless I'll pull a rabbit

01:10:22.919 --> 01:10:24.886
out of my house and put you
in the DA doghouse

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:27.522
when you choke on your
open and shut case.

01:10:27.524 --> 01:10:29.624
(laughing)

01:10:37.434 --> 01:10:39.634
- We could have a problem.

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:41.803
It would be helpful if
Veritas were present.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:43.738
- Judge Morris is scheduled
to be back in court

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:45.306
in about 10 minutes.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:47.388
- Do you really want
that post in Malibu?

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:59.520
- Good afternoon everyone.

01:11:00.824 --> 01:11:03.725
Defense council I believe
now moves to suppress

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:06.594
evidence of the defendants
gang affiliation

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.596
from the people's case in chief.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:12.433
My tentative is to allow the
jury to hear said evidence.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:17.338
Code 402 requires this
court to articulate

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.607
the basis for it's ruling.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:23.645
For the record,
Sergeant Veritas' unrebutted

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:27.649
testimony at the prelim
provides sufficient basis

01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:29.884
to allow said
evidence to be heard.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:34.439
People?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.424
- Your Honor, the people wish
to reiterate the severity

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:40.328
of the felony charges
levied against Mr. Garcia,

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:43.931
in congruence to the $4 million
payroll still unrecovered.

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:46.434
We also wish the court
to take into consideration,

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:48.536
Mr. Garcia's reluctance

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:50.872
to facilitate
any information toward

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:54.342
the apprehension of the second
perpetrator in the robbery.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:57.478
We cite Sergeant
Veritas' testimony

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.381
as to the code of silence
instituted in the gang

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:04.052
initiation rituals practiced
by the Fifth Street Muertos.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:06.087
- Is there anything else?

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:10.458
- Where is Veritas?
- I don't know.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.560
- I've asked you four times.

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:14.629
This is your job to deliver.

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:17.932
(police radio chatter)

01:12:24.374 --> 01:12:26.507
- Submit, Your Honor.

01:12:26.509 --> 01:12:30.111
- Mr. Hartford, I imagine
you'd like to be heard.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:32.914
- I do Your Honor.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.583
To start I'd like to complement
the voice of the people

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:38.820
for his eloquent reiteration
of said speculative evidence.

01:12:38.822 --> 01:12:41.122
I know I can't, nor would
I dare speak for His Honor,

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:42.990
but I now feel newly refreshed.

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:45.059
And to dare again
feel justified of said

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.462
speculative evidence,
should ever,

01:12:47.464 --> 01:12:49.430
if they were to begin with
be taking for granted.

01:12:49.432 --> 01:12:50.898
- Proceed.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.034
- Your Honor, I'll hang
my hat on the P test.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.904
Will gang evidence be more
prejudicial than probative?

01:12:56.906 --> 01:13:00.508
If the jury hears gang once,
it will echo throughout

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:03.111
this trial at the expense of
any other relevant evidence.

01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:06.481
Very prejudicial,
yet not remotely probative

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.383
of his guilt or innocence.

01:13:08.385 --> 01:13:11.486
They're hear gang,
they'll see Hispanic,

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:13.755
he'll be guilty until
proven innocent.

01:13:13.757 --> 01:13:15.957
- Well counsel I imagine
your defense will be

01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:18.626
wrong place, wrong time.

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:22.463
Your client was fleeing
the scene of a bank robbery

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:24.632
with a convicted
felon gang leader.

01:13:24.634 --> 01:13:28.536
But that seems probative
of guilt or innocence to me.

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:33.641
- Your Honor, our neighborhoods,
our experiences, shape us.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:35.777
Juan thought his Uncle
Manny had been caught

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:37.678
in the bank parking
lot by some rivals

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.514
from the old days
and so he punched it.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:42.517
- Counsel, the court's
rationality would be to concur

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:45.653
with the gang expert's
conclusion that the boy

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:48.756
grew up without a father
figure in his life

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:52.427
and looked up to his
uncle in blind faith.

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:55.863
- Your Honor, Sergeant
Veritas, can also opine

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.166
to great extent about
the fact that Manny

01:13:58.168 --> 01:14:00.902
had actually distanced
himself from the Muertos

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:03.738
to pursue an acting career
since his release from Cochran.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.707
He was a respected actor
in the Hollywood community.

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:08.976
Everybody in the neighborhood
knew it,

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:10.945
he was successful,
why would he steer his nephew

01:14:10.947 --> 01:14:12.947
toward something he was
trying to get away from?

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:17.051
- (chuckling) Your client was steering
the get away car after a robbery.

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:21.022
Now if you have evidence
of this change of heart,

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.191
then you'll be able to bring it

01:14:23.193 --> 01:14:25.626
to the attention of
the jury all you like.

01:14:25.628 --> 01:14:28.029
- Your honor, that's
what I intend to do.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:30.998
However, if the jury is
allowed to be pigeon holed

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.934
into the narrow minded
perspective that our

01:14:32.936 --> 01:14:34.969
media describes
of the gang life,

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.538
my client will be
seen as a gun slinging

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.640
character in a movie script,
rather than

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.709
the confused
teenager that he is.

01:14:41.711 --> 01:14:45.246
- Counsel, your client
has a single tattoo

01:14:45.248 --> 01:14:48.883
that aligns him with
the same gang that his uncle

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.018
was not only
participating in, but led.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.488
- That tattoo was
only one-day old

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:54.755
when this robbery occurred.

01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:56.624
Besides Juan only had
the base gravestone

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:59.026
of the tattoo without
the Muerto insignia.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.729
And without the insignia,
a perspective initiate

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:04.632
cannot earn any stripes,
i.e., the rising ghosts.

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:08.169
- Sergeant Veritas testified
that wannabe gang members

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:12.006
commit serious crimes in
order to create gang status.

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.909
- Sergeant Veritas can
also testify to the fact

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.246
that without being jumped
in and without the insignia

01:15:18.248 --> 01:15:21.182
one cannot participate
in any high-level crimes.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.785
- We have FI cards that
state that your client

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.688
was affiliated
with the same gang.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.790
- Your Honor what would
happen if say a pre-teen kid,

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:33.060
11 or 12 years old
were to deny allegiance

01:15:33.062 --> 01:15:35.563
to the Muertos in
front of his friends

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:36.864
from the same neighborhood.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.900
The code of this neighborhood
is not based upon

01:15:38.902 --> 01:15:41.269
the honor of the intellect
but that of the bicep.

01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:44.005
Your Honor in our world,
power is intellectual,

01:15:44.007 --> 01:15:47.608
financial strength.
In theirs, it's physical.

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.678
- Your precepts are more
sociologic than legal.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:55.082
However, I disagree in regards
to your assumptions that

01:15:55.084 --> 01:16:00.555
financial desire preclude
those of less financial means.

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:02.957
- A big distinction
between financial desires

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:05.119
and outright robbery of
a bank don't you think?

01:16:07.263 --> 01:16:08.930
- Mr. Hartford,
let me reiterate,

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:12.733
Sergeant Veritas' testimony
with regard to bank robbery

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:16.270
being an off used method of
financing gang activities.

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:18.739
- If easy money is
exclusively a gang objective,

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:20.975
there's a pack of
optimistic gorgeous girls

01:16:20.977 --> 01:16:22.810
wearing short skirts
and false smiles

01:16:22.812 --> 01:16:25.146
over at the Polo Lounge
that Sergeant Veritas

01:16:25.148 --> 01:16:28.115
and his anti-gang unit
could be rousting right now.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:35.156
- Mr. Hartford, defense
motion to suppress is denied.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.263
We are not here
for the philosophical debate

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:44.365
of the nature of
human perception.

01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:47.234
- Sure we are.
Prejudice is a perception.

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:50.004
Put a blue bandana on
a black man in Compton

01:16:50.006 --> 01:16:51.973
and he's a Crip.
Red a Blood.

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.941
- [Jude] Council.
- Put a turban on an Arab and he's a terrorist.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.343
- Council.

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.380
The defensive motion
to suppress is denied.

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.284
I've made my ruling.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:08.756
Now if the jury decides
that this young man

01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:11.192
made his bed, it is only
fair that he be made

01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:15.950
to lie in it
for a good long time.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:18.366
If not, then he'll walk.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:23.371
Now that's the system.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:37.952
- They don't care
if I did it or not.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:40.254
They can't find
the guy that did it.

01:17:40.256 --> 01:17:42.690
They're gonna fry me.

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:44.992
- It's not that simple, Juan.
- It is that simple.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:48.863
Manny was right, these gringos
make up the rules as they go.

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:51.165
- Gringos?
- Yeah Gringos.

01:17:51.167 --> 01:17:53.200
They're afraid of us,
they gotta keep us down.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:55.670
- The system drops a
hammer on us night and day

01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.339
and everyone of you joked
up muscle head vatos

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.975
are preparing to endure
it rather than beat it.

01:18:00.977 --> 01:18:05.413
Be a bad ass, for what,
to call the shots in the joint?

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:10.384
Man, if Manny developed his
mind along with his body,

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:13.020
maybe he could
have avoided jail.

01:18:13.022 --> 01:18:14.822
Proved to us that it
could have been done.

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:18.159
- Oh yeah, then what your
college degree get you.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:20.327
Working 24/7 for shit.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:22.329
You're going to wait your
whole life waiting for

01:18:22.331 --> 01:18:24.065
those Gringos to see you
as an equal.

01:18:24.067 --> 01:18:26.033
The only way they want
to see you

01:18:26.035 --> 01:18:27.902
is you bending over
the water cooler.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:30.037
I don't understand
you, defending them

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:31.972
especially that white dude,
that get you pregnant.

01:18:31.974 --> 01:18:33.874
A real man huh?

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.411
- Are you through?

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:40.414
- You don't know the rules
of their skyscraper world.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:43.017
So you gotta fake it, at least
I know the rules of mi barrio.

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:45.252
- Oh you know them all huh?

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:47.755
Say you get convicted
of this bullshit?

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:50.191
Certified badass right?

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:51.892
- Damn straight.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:56.397
- First week out some punk
challenges your rep, what now?

01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:01.435
- Easy fuck that nigga up
for everyone to see.

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:03.037
The rules of the street.

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:08.142
- They'll rat on you.
You know they will.

01:19:08.144 --> 01:19:10.878
Aggravated assault, battery,

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:14.115
second strike
for Mr. Badass.

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:19.820
Double the base sentence,
eight years, state prison.

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:20.955
Doubled equals 16, Juan.

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:24.792
You serve a mandatory 85%

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:26.927
even if you shine
the warden's shoes.

01:19:28.831 --> 01:19:33.400
California penal code punishes
the rules of the street.

01:19:35.004 --> 01:19:38.939
If you ever get out...
ever,

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.175
you best not spit
on the sidewalk

01:19:41.177 --> 01:19:43.177
or pop a beer can on the corner.

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:46.280
Otherwise, strike three...

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.382
you're out.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.351
Life.
(thud)

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:54.488
(dramatic music)

01:20:00.163 --> 01:20:04.265
- [Manny] On the street,
man to man,

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:06.867
you can talk all you want.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:09.270
It doesn't matter what you say,

01:20:09.272 --> 01:20:12.206
it's what you do.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:16.076
But in the skyscraper world,

01:20:16.078 --> 01:20:17.511
you have to deal with structure,

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:21.248
organization, made up of ideas.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.418
Ideas are built on words.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.453
So what you say you did,

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:29.323
becomes as important
as what you did.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.371
- Getting that check by
the middle of next week,

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:48.442
so I'll have Ducketts discover
the rest of the back rent.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.381
- I'm gonna need
somebody competent

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:56.617
to make a few more appearances.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:02.089
I can always call
the lackey but I'd rather send

01:21:02.091 --> 01:21:04.251
someone that knows what
the hell they're doing.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:09.964
You still working out
of the back of your car?

01:21:09.966 --> 01:21:14.001
- For the record, business
materials occupy the front seat.

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:15.970
My pillow, blanket,
and girly mags are back.

01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:17.605
(laughing)

01:21:19.942 --> 01:21:23.210
Is that what you think?
- You know what I think.

01:21:23.212 --> 01:21:25.546
I think you're
an underrated talent.

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:37.057
(liquid sloshing)

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:05.085
- To personal injury...

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.387
I mean civil rights.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:08.222
(laughing)

01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:15.162
- And to criminal law,
for which we both know

01:22:15.164 --> 01:22:16.931
there's no money in

01:22:16.933 --> 01:22:19.099
unless you represent
a successful criminal.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:21.635
- If they're successful,
they don't need a lawyer.

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.170
- That's right.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.649
- You know,
for well over 20 years

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:38.252
I've been representing
primarily Latinos.

01:22:38.254 --> 01:22:42.289
You'd think by know
I should know 'em.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.525
They'd just as soon
cut off their arm,

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:46.427
than sacrifice their pride.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.131
- Is this the gang expert
you were telling me about.

01:22:51.133 --> 01:22:54.134
- Yeah, Veritas.

01:22:55.071 --> 01:23:00.007
Sergeant Veritas is like
10, 11, 12 years old

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:04.478
when my client's Uncle Manny,
takes Sergeant Veritas' mom

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.982
Eva Veritas to a
Fifth Street Muertos party.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:11.051
Where she gets
whacked in a drive-by.

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:16.390
- Veritas, the truth.

01:23:16.392 --> 01:23:18.292
- If only, his
truth was ours too.

01:23:18.294 --> 01:23:19.460
I mean...

01:23:24.367 --> 01:23:28.168
I respect him, I do,

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:32.406
but this kid's life
hangs in the balance

01:23:32.408 --> 01:23:35.476
of just a few compassionate
words or omissions,

01:23:35.478 --> 01:23:38.245
a few less expert conclusions,
anything.

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:41.348
- Al the prison are filled
with guys who are not guilty.

01:23:44.387 --> 01:23:46.220
- You ever think about
all the borderline shit

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:48.555
we used to pull when
we where his age?

01:23:48.557 --> 01:23:50.290
We'd be where he is
right now if we didn't

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:52.426
grow up in such a
forgiving neighborhood.

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.561
- It's not that easy, if it was
we could redline by zip code.

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:56.397
- In essence,
isn't that what we do?

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.332
I mean a loaded gun in
this neighborhood is simply

01:23:58.334 --> 01:24:00.367
a mistake of youth,
but the same loaded gun

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.369
in this neighborhood
will get you 15 to life.

01:24:02.371 --> 01:24:04.405
- Okay so the kid
gets out what happens?

01:24:04.407 --> 01:24:06.440
He goes right back
to the same neighborhood.

01:24:06.442 --> 01:24:09.043
Right back to the same shit.
And where are you?

01:24:09.045 --> 01:24:12.112
Right back where you
started from. Wake up!

01:24:25.528 --> 01:24:26.727
I'm sorry.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:28.762
(laughing)

01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:35.602
- You ever wonder why
the first thing

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:37.538
that they send you
after you pass the bar

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:41.275
is all those drug
and rehab pamphlets?

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:43.143
(laughing)

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:55.322
- Are you all right?

01:24:57.526 --> 01:24:59.493
- I mean this kid.

01:25:03.699 --> 01:25:05.432
(laughing and mumbling)

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:06.800
- You're not.

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:15.142
(dramatic music)

01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:25.219
You're just hard on yourself.

01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:27.554
You've always been.

01:25:42.338 --> 01:25:44.371
Let me ask you something.

01:25:45.608 --> 01:25:49.910
The pyramid, which is the
most important brick?

01:25:53.282 --> 01:25:55.716
Just bear with me for a minute.

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:59.686
Which is the most important
brick on a pyramid?

01:25:59.688 --> 01:26:02.523
The top or the bottom?

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.360
Neither?

01:26:08.197 --> 01:26:10.898
The top brick gets
all the glory,

01:26:12.401 --> 01:26:14.768
but the bottom brick,
that's the structure...

01:26:16.605 --> 01:26:18.839
the strength.

01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:26.813
You take that away and
the pyramid collapses.

01:26:30.819 --> 01:26:32.886
That's the law.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:46.934
- [Diana] Mommy I missed you.

01:26:46.936 --> 01:26:48.535
(speaking Spanish)

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.871
Juliana said you
would be home soon.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:52.639
- She did gorgeous.

01:26:52.641 --> 01:26:54.541
Silent Bunny wasn't so sure.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:57.511
- Sounds like Silent Bunny
spent to much time in the Sun.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.882
Let mommy change and
then we can play okay.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.884
- When's Juan coming home?

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:11.725
- I want you to grow up slowly,

01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:15.596
if you worry too much you'll miss
all the fun out of being a kid.

01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:18.565
I only tell you grown up
things when it's necessary

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.368
because sometimes it's
not that much fun.

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:23.503
- Is Juan lost?

01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.306
- No.

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:28.375
Some people who don't know
your uncle think

01:27:28.377 --> 01:27:31.511
he did something wrong
but know he didn't.

01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:36.416
They'll know pretty soon too.

01:27:37.419 --> 01:27:40.554
- I can save him,
I can give him medicine.

01:27:40.556 --> 01:27:44.358
- You could if he was sick
mijita but he's not sick.

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.461
He's in trouble with
the law so we have a lawyer.

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:50.464
- Is that a law doctor?
- Yeah, you're so smart.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.502
- If I have the dream that
that law doctor saves him,

01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:57.871
it always comes true.

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:02.342
- Let mommy change and
then I'll read you a story.

01:28:02.344 --> 01:28:04.711
- I wanna go to bed now.

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:06.947
- It's only 7:30.
Are you as tired as I am?

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:09.049
- No, but I want to hurry up
and have my dream

01:28:09.051 --> 01:28:10.817
so I could tell you.

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:16.690
(Speaking Spanish)

01:28:22.731 --> 01:28:25.399
(sobbing)

01:28:29.605 --> 01:28:32.005
(alarm blaring)

01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:34.675
(tires screeching)

01:28:37.379 --> 01:28:39.346
- Faster! Faster!

01:28:39.348 --> 01:28:40.781
Go right.
Go right here!

01:28:40.783 --> 01:28:43.083
- What happened?
What you do?

01:28:43.085 --> 01:28:45.485
- Never mind just
a little further.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.321
- Please, please, what happened?

01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:48.922
- Trust me everything's
gonna be okay.

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:50.424
You don't know nothing.
All right?

01:28:50.426 --> 01:28:51.591
Turn left.

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.496
- I don't know what?
I don't understand.

01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:58.665
- That's the plan,
I'll do all the explaining,

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:00.400
you just tell the truth.

01:29:00.402 --> 01:29:01.935
- Why, tell them what?
Why?

01:29:01.937 --> 01:29:03.470
- I did it because I had to.

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:05.105
- For who?
- Just shut up.

01:29:05.107 --> 01:29:06.406
I did this for you.

01:29:06.408 --> 01:29:08.408
(Siren blares)

01:29:09.345 --> 01:29:11.912
(hip hop music)

01:29:50.452 --> 01:29:52.552
- What an interesting
young lady.

01:29:53.589 --> 01:29:55.622
- You look like
you're right at home.

01:29:55.624 --> 01:29:58.158
- I feel old enough
to be in a home.

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:03.096
- Speaking of arresting,
I'm guessing

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:05.899
you're not here for the show.

01:30:07.770 --> 01:30:09.936
- Your neighborhood.

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:13.407
- Was, I'm trying
to keep it that way.

01:30:15.644 --> 01:30:20.781
Quick to judge aren't we,
attorney Burney?

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:23.817
- Well it seems the "Ba-da-bing"
is to Tony Soprano

01:30:23.819 --> 01:30:26.052
the "coochie coo"
is to Sergeant Veritas.

01:30:28.123 --> 01:30:29.689
She should be proud.

01:30:29.691 --> 01:30:31.725
- We're not here
to discuss my motivations.

01:30:31.727 --> 01:30:37.731
Ain't I can't enlighten every
sarcastic Ivy League punk.

01:30:39.501 --> 01:30:41.101
- I'm not being sarcastic.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:44.704
'Cause I truly admire
the position you've carved out.

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:47.808
I could use some enlightenment

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:50.844
or at least
illumination from you,

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:54.648
as to what values
you employ in judging

01:30:54.650 --> 01:30:57.651
what is the appropriate
behavior in your neighborhood.

01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:03.056
- I like your style, counselor.

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:06.626
But you and I, we both
know that won't mean shit

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:07.828
when I up in the stand.

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.563
Now let's cut to the chase.

01:31:09.565 --> 01:31:12.899
Fact, initiates need
to prove their salt

01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:14.835
to move up in the ranks.

01:31:14.837 --> 01:31:18.905
Fact, the Muertos
are the leading gang

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:20.974
when it comes to bank robberies.

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:24.945
- You know Juan, personally.

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:31.685
- I'm the gang expert,
not the character witness.

01:31:31.687 --> 01:31:33.620
You wanna know
a person's character,

01:31:33.622 --> 01:31:35.121
you look in their home.

01:31:35.123 --> 01:31:37.858
- So one bad apple
spoils the whole bunch.

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.894
Angie, their mom,
they don't count?

01:31:40.896 --> 01:31:42.929
- They're women.

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:45.599
- Yeah I know.

01:31:47.703 --> 01:31:50.537
- Let me spell out
the facts when it comes to kids,

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:52.806
and you could talk all you want

01:31:52.808 --> 01:31:56.543
but it's what they
see that counts.

01:31:56.545 --> 01:31:58.044
Now they may not
know what it is,

01:31:58.046 --> 01:32:00.146
but they can see
racial classism.

01:32:02.718 --> 01:32:05.252
He's a boy, he wants the cars,

01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:07.554
the money, the pussy.

01:32:08.724 --> 01:32:10.123
- How did you make it?

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.727
- Just lucky I guess.

01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:15.595
- I disagree.

01:32:15.597 --> 01:32:18.131
I'd say you're one
of the exceptional ones.

01:32:18.133 --> 01:32:20.233
- I'm just your average Joe.

01:32:20.235 --> 01:32:22.035
- My opinion,
in this neighborhood,

01:32:22.037 --> 01:32:24.538
guys like you and Manny
are a cut above.

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:28.008
- Don't ever mention
my name and his

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:29.876
in the same sentence.

01:32:31.313 --> 01:32:33.246
- You don't think you're
letting your grudge with Manny

01:32:33.248 --> 01:32:35.282
cloud your vision?

01:32:35.284 --> 01:32:38.204
You guys hung out, you're
from the same neighborhood.

01:32:40.088 --> 01:32:42.188
Two nights before
Manny hits the bank,

01:32:42.190 --> 01:32:45.191
he breaks an age-old truce and
trespasses here in your back yard.

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:47.327
You think that
was a coincidence?

01:32:48.297 --> 01:32:50.664
- Fact,

01:32:50.666 --> 01:32:53.600
it wasn't the first time
Manny was on the other side

01:32:53.602 --> 01:32:55.569
of the teller's window
with all the money.

01:32:55.571 --> 01:33:00.140
Fact, Manny has always
been about himself.

01:33:00.142 --> 01:33:03.043
Fact, the Muertos
are the leading gang

01:33:03.045 --> 01:33:05.145
when it comes to bank robberies.

01:33:05.147 --> 01:33:06.947
Number one.

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:11.785
- Fact, you can't
just quit the Muertos.

01:33:11.787 --> 01:33:14.321
Fact, Manny waits a full
two minutes in the bank

01:33:14.323 --> 01:33:16.222
after the second perp
leaves with all the cash.

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:20.293
Fact, the supposed
wheel man Juan...

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:21.895
- [Manny] Come on!

01:33:21.897 --> 01:33:23.129
(tires screeching)

01:33:24.733 --> 01:33:26.933
- Doesn't even have
a driver's license.

01:33:29.371 --> 01:33:32.839
I'm just asking you
to consider those aspects

01:33:32.841 --> 01:33:35.075
of a boy's character
to make him a victim

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:36.876
of his neighborhood.

01:33:36.878 --> 01:33:40.113
(hip hop music)

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:43.116
- My job is not to judge.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.652
(hip hop music)

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.061
- [Man In White Shirt]
Bye, counselor.

01:33:55.063 --> 01:33:57.230
Don't let them titties
hit you on the way out.

01:33:58.767 --> 01:34:00.800
