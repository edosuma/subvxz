Very weird.
Mm-hmm.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.444
We'd make fun of you.
Probably.

19:06.446 --> 19:11.616
No. Or say one of you
becomes a celtics fan.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.717
Really?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.418
Yeah.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.655
You would be okay with that,
right? Right?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.526
Hmm. And let's say
one of you girls

19:21.528 --> 19:22.727
Met a very nice guy...
Mm-hmm.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.463
And decided
that you wanted to stay home

19:25.465 --> 19:26.697
And not have a career.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.501
Your mom would be
perfectly okay with that.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.736
Right, bow?

19:31.738 --> 19:34.739
Hmm?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.574
Yeah.
Ah.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.609
Okay.
All right.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.678
We're really going there, huh?
[ whispers ] oh, we're there.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.413
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

19:42.415 --> 19:46.617
Just like your dad would be
okay if one of you

19:46.619 --> 19:50.688
Thought "kingdom come"
was jay-z's best album?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.690
What?
Really?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.592
Jack:
That album is so cool.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.627
[ strained voice ]
perfectly okay.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.430
I don't think this is
about us anymore.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.600
I wanna stay and see
where this goes.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.674
I can't believe I'm about
to ask you this.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.609
But how's
young republicans going?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.611
Actually, dad,
after much thought,

20:13.613 --> 20:16.581
I've decided I'm a democrat
after all.

20:16.583 --> 20:21.519
I introduced him to one
of my liberal girlfriends,

20:21.521 --> 20:23.554
And let's just say
her "ideas"

20:23.556 --> 20:25.423
Are bigger than hillary's.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.491
Oh.
Come on, dad. I had to.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.794
Republican?
We just don't do that.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.430
[ laughs ] way to go, gurkel.
Mm.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.600
I'm gurkel!
That's<i> my</i> nickname!

20:35.602 --> 20:37.802
Ow! Ow. [ laughs ]
hey, hey, hey.

20:37.804 --> 20:41.539
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you liked it so much.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.773
I...Guess I didn't either.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.742
Well, since it means so much
to you,

20:44.744 --> 20:48.512
<i>You</i> will be my only gurkel
from now on. Cool?

20:48.514 --> 20:49.580
Thank you.
All right.

20:49.582 --> 20:53.584
We're gonna have to find you
another name. Uh...

20:53.586 --> 20:57.788
Butterfly, because you're
so delicate and graceful

20:57.790 --> 20:59.523
And looking at you
is so special.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.493
Aw, that's so sweet, dad!
I love it!

21:02.495 --> 21:04.729
Oh, I love you, butterfly.
Hey, but you know what?

21:04.731 --> 21:06.797
We're gonna have to
get you some contacts.

21:06.799 --> 21:09.634
Because glasses are not it.
Mnh-mnh.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.801
Hey, go to school,
gurkel.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.637
All right?

21:16.541 --> 21:17.742
Butterfly?

21:17.744 --> 21:20.544
[ scoffs ]

21:20.546 --> 21:22.680
I played this one all wrong.
