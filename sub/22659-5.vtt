It's a briefcase. The
contact is on her way.

00:20.022 --> 00:23.902
- She'll call you Mr. Smith.
- Mr. Smith?

00:23.982 --> 00:26.621
- Really?
- I don't make this stuff up, Frank.

00:26.622 --> 00:28.862
I think you do. I think
you do it on purpose.

00:28.942 --> 00:32.061
- Of course I don't, Frank.
- Bye, Carla.

00:43.102 --> 00:45.062
- Sorry, but...
- Hotel Saint Louis.

00:45.142 --> 00:48.382
Stay off the périphérique. Cool? Go.

00:48.422 --> 00:51.182
I'm not a taxi, and I'm not
going to the hotel Saint Louis.

00:51.262 --> 00:54.702
Ok. Taxi, limo, whatever.
Let's roll; I'm late!

00:54.782 --> 00:58.702
I'm sorry, but your punctuality
is not a priority for me.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.782
Make it a priority...

01:10.142 --> 01:11.862
Yes, Frank?

01:11.902 --> 01:13.742
How many minutes till the package drop?

01:13.822 --> 01:16.742
- Three and 20 seconds.
- Thank you, Carla.

01:16.822 --> 01:18.782
Can you run a timer on the dash screen?

01:24.062 --> 01:27.542
You'll be glad to know you
just became my priority.

01:27.582 --> 01:29.062
Good.

01:30.742 --> 01:32.222
Let's go.

01:47.742 --> 01:50.662
Oh!

01:54.022 --> 01:55.382
Uh...

01:55.422 --> 01:58.222
Ow!

01:58.302 --> 02:00.422
Ah!

02:00.502 --> 02:02.302
Ow! Slow down!

02:02.382 --> 02:04.942
Just relax! Ah!

02:06.622 --> 02:09.062
Whoa!

02:18.262 --> 02:19.862
Whoa!

02:19.902 --> 02:21.382
Ow!

02:23.542 --> 02:25.662
No!

02:38.622 --> 02:40.422
Oh, ok.

02:58.022 --> 02:59.782
Have a nice day.

03:01.862 --> 03:04.582
Mr. Smith?

03:04.662 --> 03:06.262
Destination?

03:06.342 --> 03:09.982
- Hotel Saint Louis.
- Hotel Saint Louis it is.

03:58.235 --> 04:00.395
Dieter. I was going to call you.

04:00.435 --> 04:02.515
Ah, Frank. I am very upset.
You said you would have the car

04:02.595 --> 04:04.755
- back in nice yesterday.
- I'm in Berlin.

04:04.835 --> 04:07.235
Something came up at the last minute.

04:07.315 --> 04:09.195
Ah, listen, the car is
not for picking up girls.

04:09.235 --> 04:11.395
Isn't that what you use it for?

04:11.475 --> 04:12.594
Come on, Frank, what do you think who I am?

04:12.595 --> 04:13.874
Do you really want me
to answer that question?

04:13.875 --> 04:17.675
What about that Italian waitress?
Or the American with the short hair?

04:17.714 --> 04:20.555
The American was
interested in the new model.

04:20.595 --> 04:25.115
- What was that about a new model?
- Come on, Frank. The car.

04:25.195 --> 04:27.195
Are you all right?

04:27.275 --> 04:29.195
Fuck me.

04:31.875 --> 04:34.634
- Frank bloody Martin.
- Friend of yours?

04:34.635 --> 04:35.595
A long time ago.

04:36.155 --> 04:39.395
- Ok, Dieter, I'll have it back by tomorrow night.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

04:39.475 --> 04:41.875
The software is installed in the new car.

04:41.955 --> 04:44.235
- It's ready to drive.
- Ok, I'll have it back

04:44.315 --> 04:46.155
- by tomorrow afternoon.
- Hurry home.

04:46.235 --> 04:48.315
We miss you, Frank.

04:48.395 --> 04:50.635
Five o'clock at the latest.

04:50.715 --> 04:53.915
- Sergei's here.
- Eh?

04:53.995 --> 04:56.995
Sergei's here.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.795
Right.

05:02.475 --> 05:04.955
Sergei, mate!

05:05.035 --> 05:07.115
Buy you a drink?

05:11.555 --> 05:14.275
Run and get yourself a drink, love.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.515
Go on. Chop, chop.

05:16.595 --> 05:19.195
Fuck me. Women, eh?

05:19.275 --> 05:20.875
Can't live with 'em,

05:20.955 --> 05:25.635
can't slice 'em up and feed 'em to the cat.

05:25.675 --> 05:28.795
Anyway, it's nice of you to
come in person. I'm honored.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.315
Jimmy,

05:30.395 --> 05:32.235
we work together for two years now.

05:32.315 --> 05:34.154
Everything has gone smoothly.

05:34.155 --> 05:36.675
I am on the whole quite happy.

05:37.435 --> 05:40.475
- What do you mean, on the whole?
- The problems in Geneva.

05:40.555 --> 05:42.795
Fuck me. Listen,

05:42.835 --> 05:44.915
that bloke was shooting at us, right?

05:44.995 --> 05:46.875
- Let's make that clear.
- I understand, I understand.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.675
Nonetheless, the serb died,

05:49.755 --> 05:54.795
and we attracted some
unwanted attention, right?

05:54.875 --> 05:57.595
Right. Point taken.

05:57.675 --> 06:00.115
It won't happen again.

06:00.155 --> 06:03.835
You should know there are people
who don't want me to use you.

06:03.915 --> 06:05.875
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

06:05.955 --> 06:08.635
Would you like me to talk to these people?

06:08.715 --> 06:10.155
No.

06:12.075 --> 06:14.355
Just giving you a fair warning.

06:16.795 --> 06:20.195
There're not going to
be any problems, right?

06:20.275 --> 06:23.035
Right. You can rely on me.

06:23.115 --> 06:24.795
I mean, fuck, you know that.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.875
Yeah, I know.

06:27.915 --> 06:31.275
I know, Jimmy.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.835
Five million dollars pure heroin.

06:36.915 --> 06:40.035
The usual place. The
man who brings the money

06:40.115 --> 06:43.075
only drives Audi. English.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.475
All right.

06:45.555 --> 06:47.435
Got it, mate.

06:47.475 --> 06:50.115
Me and the boys, uh, we've got you covered.

06:50.195 --> 06:53.235
You better.

06:59.315 --> 07:02.795
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- I haven't finished my drink.

07:02.875 --> 07:04.995
Then bring it with you, darling.

07:05.075 --> 07:06.915
I was going to order another one.

07:06.955 --> 07:08.835
What the fuck is the matter with you?

07:08.875 --> 07:10.755
Have you never heard
of fucking room service?

07:10.795 --> 07:14.154
Which is what I want some of right now,

07:14.155 --> 07:16.635
so get the fuck upstairs.

07:19.835 --> 07:21.675
That's it.

07:21.755 --> 07:24.315
Oh, fuck, yeah.

07:24.355 --> 07:27.075
Ah, yeah. Come on.

07:27.115 --> 07:28.715
Fuck...

07:28.795 --> 07:32.875
Ah, yeah. Ah, fuck, you like
a little English, don't you?

07:32.955 --> 07:34.355
Hey? Want some more?

07:34.435 --> 07:36.595
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck. Go on.

07:36.675 --> 07:39.035
- It's really great.
- Ah, fuck.

07:39.075 --> 07:41.675
Come on, a bit faster. Come on. Come on.

07:41.755 --> 07:45.635
Come on. Come on. Come on. That's it.

07:45.675 --> 07:47.795
Oh, fuck me. Come on, yeah.

07:47.875 --> 07:51.595
That's it. That's it. Ah.

07:55.635 --> 07:57.595
Oh!

07:59.675 --> 08:01.515
Oh, fuck.

08:01.595 --> 08:04.195
Oh, oh, get off.

08:04.275 --> 08:05.675
Get off.

08:05.755 --> 08:07.955
Oh, fuck, that's better.

08:09.835 --> 08:12.355
Oh. Fuck me.

08:16.035 --> 08:17.995
Oh, fuck.

08:20.355 --> 08:23.035
Mmm.

08:23.515 --> 08:27.595
So... you know that guy you saw earlier?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.595
Who is he?

08:33.275 --> 08:35.195
What do you want to know about him for?

08:35.235 --> 08:37.635
He drives a really nice car.

08:37.715 --> 08:40.075
Does he, now?

08:40.155 --> 08:42.755
And how the fuck would you know that?

08:42.835 --> 08:45.635
He came into the hotel last night.

08:45.715 --> 08:47.355
And where was I?

08:47.435 --> 08:49.875
Drunk, in the bar.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.675
What kind of car did he
drive? Did you notice?

08:55.755 --> 08:59.155
- Audi.
- Audi.

09:01.755 --> 09:03.675
Frank fucking Martin.

09:06.395 --> 09:10.355
The connection is Frank Martin.

09:10.395 --> 09:12.435
Sergei hired Frank for this job.

09:12.475 --> 09:14.155
Who is he?

09:16.475 --> 09:18.355
Tell me.

09:18.435 --> 09:20.595
We can get drunk and you
can fuck me again later.

09:20.635 --> 09:22.035
Yeah?

09:22.115 --> 09:25.515
You know what, Adelyne?

09:25.555 --> 09:27.115
I like you.

09:27.155 --> 09:28.595
You're simple.

09:28.675 --> 09:31.795
You've got simple tastes.
A bedtime story you want,

09:31.875 --> 09:36.595
a bedtime fucking story
you're going to get.

09:41.555 --> 09:43.275
Right.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.715
Six years ago,

09:45.755 --> 09:49.515
Frank and me, we was in the same SAS unit

09:49.555 --> 09:51.475
in the Queen's bloody army.

09:51.555 --> 09:53.675
We started this little...

09:55.515 --> 09:59.155
firm, if you like... an extraction squad.

09:59.235 --> 10:02.675
We'd go into the nastiest fucking places,

10:02.715 --> 10:06.075
places nobody else would dare go into,

10:06.155 --> 10:09.555
and we'd pull people out
who needed pulling out...

10:09.635 --> 10:13.795
journos, politicians, the like.

10:15.675 --> 10:17.555
We was on this one job...

10:17.515 --> 10:19.675
Right, and Frank's just cool as a cucumber.

10:19.715 --> 10:21.515
He's just standing there
watching this geezer,

10:21.595 --> 10:24.795
fucking ice in his veins,
you know what I mean?

10:24.835 --> 10:27.435
That's what makes you the best, Frank.

10:27.515 --> 10:29.435
Finished, Jimmy?

10:29.475 --> 10:31.635
Sorry, mate, I was just, you
know, fucking entertaining

10:31.715 --> 10:34.115
the troops. Sorry. Having a laugh.

10:34.195 --> 10:36.835
Go on, then.

10:36.875 --> 10:38.915
This is the pickup. We'll meet him

10:38.955 --> 10:42.595
at the warehouse, tomorrow at midnight.

10:44.475 --> 10:45.955
Who is he, Frank?

10:45.995 --> 10:48.675
He's clean. And the local
warlord wants him dead.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.595
- Who's paying the contract?
- The French.

10:50.715 --> 10:52.155
The French. Political, then.

10:52.195 --> 10:55.275
I don't know, Jimmy. It's
the same as the other jobs.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.035
We pick him up, and we
get him across the border.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.235
Oh, we're a fucking escort service now?

11:00.315 --> 11:02.195
You don't have to come. You know that.

11:02.275 --> 11:05.555
- You'll still get your cut.
- Frankie, Frankie, mate.

11:05.635 --> 11:09.675
If you think I'm gonna leave you by
yourself in that fucking shithole...

11:09.755 --> 11:11.475
Never happen, mate.

11:11.555 --> 11:15.875
Never. I would never
abandon you. On my honor.

11:15.915 --> 11:18.275
I got a question, though.

11:18.315 --> 11:20.195
Why a warehouse?

11:20.275 --> 11:22.795
- Normally it's a public place.
- He's in hiding.

11:22.875 --> 11:26.515
Internal security is after
him. I don't like it either.

11:26.595 --> 11:28.515
- But he's one of the good guys.
- So we took the job.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.355
And we don't change the deal.

11:30.435 --> 11:33.395
Now you boys get some sleep.
I'm going to find us a van.

11:35.275 --> 11:36.835
All right?

11:41.315 --> 11:44.035
So we went back the next night.

11:44.075 --> 11:46.915
It was an easy fucking job:

11:46.995 --> 11:51.035
go in, pick up the old
geezer, get him to Turkey.

12:08.115 --> 12:10.955
As soon as we ID the package,
I come out and get the van;

12:11.035 --> 12:13.275
Devon, you and Miles secure;
Jimmy, you've got the package;

12:13.355 --> 12:15.035
Dave, you're covering the
inside, you come out last.

12:15.115 --> 12:16.675
Yeah? Got it?

12:16.755 --> 12:19.275
Ok, let's move.

12:19.355 --> 12:21.715
I don't know, Jimmy. It doesn't feel right.

12:21.755 --> 12:24.755
What's the matter? Lost your bottle, Frank?

12:24.795 --> 12:26.955
We have to think of the
package and the others.

12:27.035 --> 12:30.715
If the cops know we're in there, we
ain't making it back to the van anyway.

12:30.795 --> 12:34.395
- Coming in, lads. Clear?
- Clear.

12:45.435 --> 12:46.875
Clear.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.674
Christ.

12:55.675 --> 12:59.035
Looks like the package
needs a little help, Frank.

12:59.115 --> 13:01.595
I'm coming through that
door. I'll get the van.

13:01.635 --> 13:05.035
All right. We need to
make sure it's all clear.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.035
I'm going to go check upstairs.

13:07.075 --> 13:09.475
- All right. Dave, go with him.
- All right.

13:28.955 --> 13:30.715
I'll check back here.

13:30.755 --> 13:34.675
Dev, go get the door so
Frank can get the van in.

14:05.395 --> 14:08.955
Hello, sunshine. Having a kip? Hey?

14:11.075 --> 14:13.395
He's dead! It's a fucking setup!

14:26.355 --> 14:29.315
Fucking marvelous!

14:33.875 --> 14:38.195
- Miles! Where's Dave?
- He's shot!

14:38.235 --> 14:41.875
Make a move! Come on! Devon, get in!

14:43.955 --> 14:46.235
Jimmy!

14:46.315 --> 14:48.515
I'm a little fucking busy, Frankie!

14:55.475 --> 14:57.475
Jimmy, you've got to make a fucking move!

15:05.555 --> 15:08.075
- Fucker!
- We got him! Move in!

15:08.115 --> 15:11.955
- Go! Go! Go!
- Jimmy! Come on! I'll cover you!

15:17.115 --> 15:19.515
I'm fuckin' pinned down!

15:19.595 --> 15:21.915
Don't fuckin' leave me, Frank!

15:23.955 --> 15:25.755
We've got him! Stop the van!

15:25.835 --> 15:27.995
Jimmy, we gotta go or we're all fucked!

15:31.315 --> 15:33.395
Don't fuckin' leave me!

15:44.235 --> 15:45.755
Frank!

15:45.835 --> 15:49.275
Fuck you! Fuck!

15:49.355 --> 15:50.795
Frank!

15:53.755 --> 15:55.995
Frank!

15:58.635 --> 16:00.595
And he just left me there.

16:05.675 --> 16:10.675
Do you know how long...
I spent in that shithole?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.875
And there he is just walking about town,

16:15.955 --> 16:18.995
like nothing fucking happened.

16:19.035 --> 16:20.755
Jack the lad.

16:20.795 --> 16:22.755
Top of the fucking world.

16:29.195 --> 16:31.675
What are you going to do now?

16:33.675 --> 16:36.115
I'm going to seize the tactical advantage.

16:39.275 --> 16:41.955
I'm going to kill two birds with one stone.

17:22.315 --> 17:24.635
That's it, Frank,

17:24.714 --> 17:27.595
hand it over to him.

17:31.795 --> 17:32.754
There's a good boy.

17:32.755 --> 17:34.755
So, give me the case, and
we'll both be on our way.

17:40.635 --> 17:43.755
The deal is I take that
case to another location...

17:43.835 --> 17:46.395
Shut up.

18:13.035 --> 18:14.915
He's got the money!

18:49.155 --> 18:50.875
Jimmy.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.795
Hello, Anton.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.795
Nice job, son.

18:58.835 --> 19:02.035
This should help you get out of town fast.

19:05.075 --> 19:07.955
- Sergei can't find out.
- Who's gonna tell him?

20:52.515 --> 20:54.475
Ahhh!

21:32.715 --> 21:35.435
Move and you're fucking dead.

21:37.955 --> 21:39.915
Let's go.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.915
What did I tell ya? Piece of cake.

21:47.995 --> 21:49.595
It was Frank! Frank!

21:49.675 --> 21:51.755
You didn't tell me we'd
be setting Frank up!

21:51.835 --> 21:54.595
Easy, mate. Calm yourself.
The job needed to be done.

21:54.715 --> 21:56.595
If I'd told you, you wouldn't
have gone through with it,

21:56.635 --> 21:58.715
- now, would ya?
- Damn right. He was one of us!

21:58.755 --> 22:00.635
Yes, was one of us, Dev!

22:00.675 --> 22:03.915
Do I have to remind you how
he turned his back on the team?

22:03.995 --> 22:05.875
This has got nothing to do
with Frank turning his back.

22:05.915 --> 22:09.275
It's just more of your bullshit, and
you're dragging everybody else in with you.

22:09.315 --> 22:11.195
Fine, then.

22:11.235 --> 22:13.955
You're upset about Frank. I get that.

22:14.035 --> 22:16.955
You wanna take a moral stand?
Actually, I respect that.

22:21.795 --> 22:24.595
So, you'll be foregoing
your cut, then. Am I right?

22:24.635 --> 22:29.275
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Anyone else wanna take a moral stand? Eh?

22:29.315 --> 22:31.435
I didn't think so.

22:31.515 --> 22:34.235
Looks like you're the odd man out, mate.

22:31.755 --> 22:35.915
So here's what I want you to do.

22:35.995 --> 22:40.155
I want you to think real hard

22:40.195 --> 22:43.995
about who's had your
back all these years. Eh?

22:44.035 --> 22:47.835
Where the fuck was Frank
Martin three months ago?

22:47.875 --> 22:52.715
Was he carrying your fucking ass
out of that shithole in Yemen?

22:52.795 --> 22:54.235
Was he?

22:59.035 --> 23:02.235
You wanna walk away, Dev, go ahead.

23:02.315 --> 23:05.395
Fuck off. Turn your back on
the team just the way he did.

23:14.555 --> 23:17.515
There you go. See, I knew you wouldn't,

23:17.595 --> 23:20.515
because you, my friend,

23:20.595 --> 23:24.275
Honor.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.515
You know this ain't over, right?

23:28.595 --> 23:31.195
The last person you want
to piss off is Frank Martin.

23:40.115 --> 23:43.595
- It's me.
- Hello, Frank. How's the weather in Berlin?

23:43.635 --> 23:46.675
- I was set up.
- What? What happened?

23:46.755 --> 23:49.395
An ambush at the first drop point.
They left with both packages.

23:49.435 --> 23:52.554
Oh, shit! Well at least you're alive.

23:52.555 --> 23:54.275
If they wanted me dead, I wouldn't
be speaking to you right now.

23:54.675 --> 23:56.715
Well, then the question
Why are you still alive?

23:56.755 --> 23:58.635
They need someone
to take the fall for this.

23:58.675 --> 24:00.995
- How well do you know the client?
- I don't know him at all.

24:01.075 --> 24:04.515
- Well, you better find the client. I want to talk to him.
- Frank, he might not be involved.

24:04.595 --> 24:06.475
If he's not involved, I'll find
his package and return it to him.

24:06.515 --> 24:08.554
If he is involved, he's
going to regret hiring me.

24:08.555 --> 24:09.515
Leave it to me.

24:09.395 --> 24:12.555
I have a cell phone number for
him. I'm going to run a trace.

24:18.995 --> 24:20.395
Yes?

24:20.435 --> 24:22.075
Sergei, it's Jimmy.

24:22.155 --> 24:23.555
Jimmy.

24:23.635 --> 24:27.075
You're calling me because
something went wrong, yes?

24:27.155 --> 24:30.474
The man who was supposed to
bring the money came with a crew.

24:30.475 --> 24:32.115
I just made it back.

24:32.235 --> 24:34.595
Ok. What about your crew?

24:34.675 --> 24:38.395
My lads didn't make it, Sergei.

24:38.475 --> 24:41.315
Ah, sorry to hear that.

24:41.395 --> 24:44.035
My money? Where is my money?

24:44.115 --> 24:46.155
It's gone.

24:46.195 --> 24:49.475
The drugs, money, all my men fucking gone.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.995
I thought we discussed that, Jimmy.
There were going to be no problems.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.475
Someone fucked us over, Sergei.

24:55.555 --> 24:57.755
The bloke with the money was an assassin.

24:57.835 --> 24:59.715
My men went after him, but...

24:59.795 --> 25:02.515
by the time I got there,
they were all dead.

25:02.595 --> 25:04.315
Did you see the man?

25:04.395 --> 25:06.955
Yeah, I saw him... know him, in fact.

25:06.995 --> 25:11.235
Bloke by the name of Frank Martin.

25:11.315 --> 25:14.715
Find Frank Martin, Jimmy.

25:14.795 --> 25:18.635
- You want me to bring him to you?
- No.

25:18.715 --> 25:20.555
I don't want to see him.

25:20.635 --> 25:24.355
I want to see my product, and my money.

25:24.395 --> 25:26.835
Jimmy,

25:26.915 --> 25:31.035
I am holding you personally
responsible for it.

25:31.115 --> 25:32.915
Please don't fuck this up.

25:32.995 --> 25:35.435
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

25:46.155 --> 25:49.195
Hello. Angela Ramsay, Interpol.

25:49.235 --> 25:51.755
I need your support
relating to the back tracking

25:51.835 --> 25:54.155
a call that your hotel switchboard

25:54.235 --> 25:57.515
put through at 6:43 earlier today.

26:00.635 --> 26:02.394
- Carla.
- Hey, Frank.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.474
I hope you've got good news.

26:03.475 --> 26:05.835
The client's name is Sergei Zavrov.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.875
That doesn't sound like
good news. Location?

26:07.915 --> 26:10.035
Still working on it.

26:10.115 --> 26:12.835
But I received a strange
phone call this morning.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.115
- Who from?
- It was a landline.

26:15.155 --> 26:17.355
The caller said you'll
find what you're looking for

26:17.435 --> 26:19.275
at the hotel Gracienne.

26:19.355 --> 26:20.875
Room 1002.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.555
- I'm on my way.
- Be careful, Frank.

26:44.675 --> 26:46.555
Yeah.

26:46.635 --> 26:48.715
- It's Miles.
- Got him?

26:48.795 --> 26:50.755
Yeah. He came, just like you said he would.

26:50.795 --> 26:53.875
- He's going into the hotel now.
- Course he did.

26:53.955 --> 26:57.635
Good boy. Thanks.

27:11.915 --> 27:13.315
Jimmy.

27:13.355 --> 27:15.235
I know where Frank Martin is.

27:15.275 --> 27:17.155
He's at the hotel Gracienne.

27:17.195 --> 27:18.635
Hotel Gracienne?

27:18.715 --> 27:21.035
Why, why should I care where he is, Jimmy?

27:21.115 --> 27:24.395
I would have thought you'd like to
talk to him about your merchandise.

27:24.475 --> 27:27.435
Are you telling me you cannot
take care of this matter yourself?

27:27.515 --> 27:30.635
Like I told you, I'm a little
short of manpower right now.

27:30.715 --> 27:33.355
Jimmy, Jimmy, I will send Dimitri.

27:35.235 --> 27:36.635
Take Petros,

27:36.675 --> 27:39.595
and Yuri.

27:39.675 --> 27:42.915
Mr. Martin should die very slowly.

27:42.955 --> 27:45.635
Then bring me Jimmy Reeves.

27:48.915 --> 27:52.355
Ha bloody ha, Frank fucking Martin.

27:52.435 --> 27:54.475
Champagne! Let's celebrate.

27:54.555 --> 27:57.195
You are always so pleased with yourself?

27:57.275 --> 28:01.875
Things, my love, are
going exactly as I hoped.

28:06.315 --> 28:07.795
Here you go.

28:11.115 --> 28:13.075
Here's to Frank.

28:59.515 --> 29:01.835
- Yes, Frank?
- The room's empty.

29:01.915 --> 29:04.315
Did you get a name on the reservation?

29:04.355 --> 29:05.955
Not yet.

29:27.875 --> 29:30.275
Elevator. You two come with me.

29:50.235 --> 29:53.115
Down! Down! Down!

30:12.075 --> 30:14.955
The room's registered under a James Severe.

30:15.035 --> 30:16.475
Mean anything to you?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.555
Jimmy Reeves. An old army friend.

30:18.595 --> 30:20.755
Severe was his code name.

30:20.795 --> 30:23.235
He was holding a bit of a grudge, and he
never missed a chance to screw things up.

30:23.315 --> 30:27.435
- What's the plan?
- Me and Jimmy need a bit of a chinwag.

30:29.635 --> 30:31.995
First I have some company to deal with.

31:31.235 --> 31:34.035
Hello, mate.

31:34.115 --> 31:37.075
Frank! Christ. Frank Martin.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.755
It's been a while.

31:38.835 --> 31:41.235
- How's it going, Sam?
- You know, same.

31:41.315 --> 31:43.475
Always the same shit.

31:43.515 --> 31:46.035
So, single malt, on the rocks?

31:46.075 --> 31:49.035
- Sure.
- So, what brings you by?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.475
Jimmy Reeves.

31:50.515 --> 31:52.795
Know where I can find him?

31:52.875 --> 31:54.355
I heard he was in town.

31:54.395 --> 31:55.955
Yeah.

31:56.035 --> 31:58.635
I haven't seen him in years.

31:58.675 --> 32:01.635
Sam.

32:03.515 --> 32:05.955
Ah, you're putting me in a bad spot here.

32:06.035 --> 32:09.515
Not half as bad as the one Jimmy's
put me in. I need to find him fast.

32:16.395 --> 32:19.195
He and his boys are holed
up at a place in potsdam.

32:22.995 --> 32:26.635
You know every lowlife piece of
scum between here and Istanbul.

32:28.515 --> 32:30.555
Where is Sergei? Last chance.

32:30.635 --> 32:32.755
Listen, Carla, I'm telling the truth.

32:32.795 --> 32:36.435
Ok, I have revenue services on speed dial.

32:36.475 --> 32:38.035
I can't help you, Carla!

32:38.075 --> 32:40.595
Look, you play by the rules.

32:40.635 --> 32:43.875
This guy Sergei... doesn't.

32:55.195 --> 32:57.995
- Yes?
- It's Miles.

32:58.035 --> 33:01.155
Frank Martin showed up at the
bar asking about Jimmy Reeves.

33:03.955 --> 33:07.395
- How long ago was this?
- About 20 minutes ago.

33:07.475 --> 33:09.755
Hmm. And what did Sam tell him?

33:09.835 --> 33:11.675
He told him where Jimmy lives.
He's on his way there right now.

33:11.755 --> 33:16.875
- Ah, ok. Thank you, Miles.
- Right.

33:20.915 --> 33:24.115
Dimitri, would you
assemble the men, please?

33:55.875 --> 33:59.115
Come on. Pick up. Pick up.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.355
Thank you.

34:28.875 --> 34:32.155
- Nice one, Frank.
- Where's the money?

34:32.235 --> 34:34.475
- What fucking money?
- It's me you want a piece of.

34:34.554 --> 34:35.554
Oh, I want a piece of you.

34:35.554 --> 34:38.395
That's what makes this job
so sweet, Frank. Payback.

34:38.275 --> 34:41.514
Where's the money?

34:41.554 --> 34:44.475
It's over there. It's ov...
I'll fucking show you, all right?

34:44.554 --> 34:46.915
All right? Fuck. Ah!

34:46.955 --> 34:50.114
Right there. Ah! Fuck!
Right there. Go on, then!

34:50.155 --> 34:54.235
If that's what you're after, fucking
take it. How about we call it quits?

35:03.875 --> 35:06.195
Running out on me again, eh, Frankie?

35:06.275 --> 35:09.195
- What the fuck do I tell Sergei?
- That's your problem.

35:09.235 --> 35:10.875
Not mine.

35:10.955 --> 35:13.475
Fucking bollocks.

35:25.355 --> 35:28.595
- A little rusty, eh, Frankie?
- I was about to say the same thing to you, Jimmy.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.675
- Now, what's this all about?
- You know what this is about.

35:31.755 --> 35:34.275
You fucking lost your ball,

35:34.315 --> 35:36.635
and you legged it. You
left me in the fucking shit!

35:36.715 --> 35:38.715
You turned soft, mate.

35:38.795 --> 35:42.875
Look at you. A fucking
pussy in a poncey suit.

35:45.115 --> 35:47.515
Uh-uh, mate.

35:57.315 --> 36:03.995
Fifteen months in an
excrement-filled hole because of you.

36:04.075 --> 36:06.435
Ah! Ah!

36:08.435 --> 36:10.435
You never could win a fair fight, Jimmy.

36:10.515 --> 36:12.515
You ran out on me, Frank.

36:12.595 --> 36:15.635
The cops showed up, and
you fucking legged it.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.114
The cops were there all along,
Jimmy. Someone tipped them off.

36:18.115 --> 36:22.315
Oh, really? Who the fuck
would that have been, then, eh?

36:22.395 --> 36:26.315
There were two of us up top, right?
Someone sent a signal. I saw it.

36:30.035 --> 36:33.275
Miles, what the fuck are you doing?

36:33.315 --> 36:38.075
- And only one man came down.
- Dave was shot.

36:38.115 --> 36:40.995
I did a job in Bishkek
a couple of years ago.

36:41.035 --> 36:43.115
Some old files needed to
get out of the country.

36:43.195 --> 36:46.275
One of them concerned a security asset
working for old intelligence services.

36:46.315 --> 36:48.995
I saw the photos of Dave's body.

36:52.515 --> 36:55.195
He wasn't shot;

36:55.235 --> 36:57.995
- his throat was slit.
- Jimmy, he's lying.

36:58.075 --> 36:59.955
- You killed Dave?
- Jimmy, no!

37:00.035 --> 37:01.995
- You dirty fucking bastard.
- He's ly...

37:06.315 --> 37:08.675
Can't trust anyone these
days, can you, Frank?

37:08.715 --> 37:12.395
- I'm not the enemy, Jimmy.
- You abandoned me, Frank!

37:12.475 --> 37:15.395
You and me, we was like brothers!

37:15.475 --> 37:17.195
Jimmy.

37:17.275 --> 37:20.555
I can't let go of it.

37:20.635 --> 37:24.755
I see it every fucking
night when I'm dreaming.

37:24.835 --> 37:28.715
The van pulling off, and you
just fucking left me there.

37:28.795 --> 37:31.395
There was nothing else I could do.
You missed the fucking boat, Jimmy.

37:31.435 --> 37:33.395
I had to save as many of us as I could,

37:33.475 --> 37:35.355
and you would have done
exactly the same fucking thing.

37:35.395 --> 37:37.355
No, I wouldn't have!

37:39.235 --> 37:41.115
I never would!

37:41.155 --> 37:43.635
I would have come back for you, Frank!

37:43.715 --> 37:46.235
We would have died to-fucking-gether!

37:49.955 --> 37:51.875
Frank, I swear to you,

37:51.915 --> 37:54.115
I didn't know you were the mark.
If I knew, none of this would

37:54.195 --> 37:56.755
have happened. Trust me.

37:56.835 --> 37:58.795
Put your weapon down, Dev.

37:58.875 --> 38:02.035
You put it down, bro. You put it down.

38:02.115 --> 38:06.195
What the fuck happened to us, eh, Frankie?

38:06.275 --> 38:09.515
We were brothers, mate.

38:11.435 --> 38:14.915
I didn't turn soft. And
I didn't run out on you.

38:14.995 --> 38:18.195
We were chosen by the SAS for our honor.

38:18.235 --> 38:21.515
Frank made his choices.
So did we, Jimmy. Come on.

38:23.395 --> 38:27.595
We'll always be brothers, Jimmy.

38:27.675 --> 38:29.595
Come on, put it down.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.715
- You're gonna be all right.
- I've survived worse,

38:43.795 --> 38:47.075
Frankie.

38:47.155 --> 38:50.995
That part about you being rusty...

38:51.035 --> 38:53.435
bit of a lie.

38:53.475 --> 38:56.635
You fuckin' broke my nose,
mate.

38:56.675 --> 38:58.835
Fuck me.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.995
Well, you never were pretty, Jimmy.

39:01.075 --> 39:03.875
Man.

39:08.915 --> 39:11.235
Frank.

39:55.075 --> 39:57.875
You two, south side. Wait for my orders.

39:57.915 --> 39:59.395
You two stay here.

40:02.235 --> 40:05.355
- Yes, Dimitri.
- Sergei.

40:05.395 --> 40:08.275
We got here in time. He's
still here. Very good.

40:08.315 --> 40:12.115
No survivors, please. Da, Sergei.

40:12.195 --> 40:14.355
Let's go! Come on!

40:37.475 --> 40:40.195
Let's get the fuck out of here.

40:40.275 --> 40:42.475
The buyers are waiting.

40:42.515 --> 40:44.875
Come on!

41:44.515 --> 41:46.435
Ugh!

42:02.395 --> 42:04.595
Jimmy!

42:04.635 --> 42:06.915
Drop the case!

42:12.915 --> 42:14.195
Ugh!

43:01.915 --> 43:04.435
It's important to have the proper cookware.

43:04.515 --> 43:07.595
I could've handled him.

43:07.675 --> 43:11.195
Yeah. Just like Bangkok.

43:13.115 --> 43:14.955
Brothers.

43:15.035 --> 43:16.755
Brothers.

43:16.835 --> 43:18.875
Dinner ready?

43:24.875 --> 43:26.835
Get out of town.

43:26.915 --> 43:29.675
Lay low for a while.

43:29.715 --> 43:31.755
Sergei's going to be coming after you.

43:31.795 --> 43:34.635
I wouldn't be too sure about that, mate.

43:34.675 --> 43:39.555
I made a phone call that will
put Sergei away for a while.

44:12.715 --> 44:15.195
- May I finish packing, please?
- You'll be getting

44:15.275 --> 44:18.835
a change of clothing, courtesy
of the Belgian government.

44:18.915 --> 44:21.195
Belgian? Oh, not the Belgians.

44:21.275 --> 44:23.995
Payback is a bitch, isn't it?
