arrive at this moment?"</i>

00:40.214 --> 00:42.172

like it was yesterday.</i>

00:42.216 --> 00:44.783

this happened today.</i>

00:49.962 --> 00:51.094
What's you got there, yo?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.965
What? This?

00:53.009 --> 00:56.360
It's only the best birthday
gift Batman will ever receive.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.103
Aw, man,
not this again.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.539
What?

01:01.583 --> 01:03.213
Every year, you try to win
the Batman's approval

01:03.237 --> 01:05.108
by giving him
the perfect birthday gift.

01:05.152 --> 01:08.720
And every year
you end up the disappointed.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.071
Stop torturing yourself, bro.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.289
It's never gonna happen.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.900
Yes, it will

01:14.944 --> 01:17.729
because this year I'm going
to deliver this gift myself.

01:17.773 --> 01:20.210
So Batman can see
how much hard work

01:20.254 --> 01:21.820
I've put into his birthday.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.388
Wow, so you're going to drive
all the way to Gotham city,

01:24.432 --> 01:26.086
just to get
on Batman's good side?

01:26.129 --> 01:27.739
That's right.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.413
Well I'm sorry to put
a damper on your plans,
my man,

01:29.437 --> 01:31.265
but the T-car is in the shop.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.833
Not a problem.
I can take the bus.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.140
No way!
He's gonna ride the bus?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.272
We love riding the bus.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.838
You can take
a nap while you travel.

01:39.882 --> 01:42.014
And they make
those sweet bus noises like...

01:42.058 --> 01:46.106
and...

01:46.149 --> 01:49.326
And the wheels on the bus
go the round and the round

01:49.370 --> 01:50.980
all through the town.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.155
Can we's come along?

01:52.199 --> 01:54.766
- Ooh, please?
- The please?

01:54.810 --> 01:56.986
I suppose
I could use the company.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.161
Great, then it's settled.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.772
Gotham city here we come.

02:00.816 --> 02:01.817
Ow.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.825
Sweet! It's empty.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.306
It looks like we gots
our own party bus, yo.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.620
Hmm, guess we're not
the only passengers.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.319
Well, I for the one
am excited

02:25.362 --> 02:27.321
to meet
our delightful new friends.

02:30.062 --> 02:31.062
Hi.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.287
Relax, Star.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:37.331 --> 02:38.462
They're just clowns.

02:38.506 --> 02:41.378
Hey, who you calling a clown?

02:41.422 --> 02:43.293
I'm just clowning ya.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.905
So you are not
the evil clowns

02:46.949 --> 02:48.864
who wish to
drag us into the sewer?

02:48.907 --> 02:50.387
No, we're fun clowns

02:50.431 --> 02:52.215
on the way
to the Clown Convention.

02:52.259 --> 02:55.087
Lots of face painting,
balloon shaping,

02:55.131 --> 02:57.046
and magic tricks, wow.

02:57.089 --> 02:59.091
It's the best day of the year.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.354
You guys wanna come?

03:00.397 --> 03:01.920
We got extra costumes.

03:01.964 --> 03:05.402
Oh, we'd love to but
we're on
a very important miss...

03:05.446 --> 03:06.882
- Yes.
- We're in.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.013
Hurray.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.773
Beastie,
spraying a clown in the face

03:28.817 --> 03:31.341
is like the most
offensive thing you can do
in clown culture.

03:31.385 --> 03:32.908
How's I supposed to know that?

03:34.257 --> 03:35.257
Get him.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.230
I can't believe this.

03:50.273 --> 03:51.753
I know right,

03:51.796 --> 03:53.296
you cause one little fight
and they kick you off the bus.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.756
The nerve of those dudes!

03:54.799 --> 03:57.759
No, I can't believe
I let you guys tag along.

03:57.802 --> 04:01.589
Now, we're stranded out
in the middle of Nowhere.

04:01.632 --> 04:04.766
Relax, dude, maybe Raven's
spell book can help.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.813
- Uh-oh.
- What is the wrong?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.859
I think I left my spell book
on the bus.

04:12.643 --> 04:15.298
"Azarath Metrion Zinthos?"

04:17.953 --> 04:21.086
Great, at this rate
we're never gonna get
to Gotham City.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.740
Look on the bright side,

04:22.784 --> 04:25.308
now we have an excuse
to check out
some of the local sites.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.399
There you Rodeo clowns are!

04:29.443 --> 04:31.096
We've been
looking all over for you.

04:31.140 --> 04:32.968
Rodeo clowns?

04:33.011 --> 04:34.622
Huh? Whoa!

04:36.319 --> 04:37.319
Wow!

04:40.715 --> 04:43.805
Oh, look, friends.
It is the 10-gallon milk hat.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.112
Howdy the partner?

04:47.156 --> 04:48.940
Yep-yep-yee!

05:04.478 --> 05:06.480
I am getting the hang of this.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.527
Wow, she's doing really well.

05:10.571 --> 05:13.443
I'm just relieved
we don't have to go in there.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.749
Go get 'em, clowns.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.856
Titans,
let's get out of here.

05:49.523 --> 05:51.525
Woah, there, there.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.917
You've tamed the beast, Star.

05:52.961 --> 05:56.268
Oh, he is no beast.
He is my friend.

05:56.312 --> 06:00.577
And I have named him
Lactose Free Cowmilk.

06:00.621 --> 06:01.839
Now go.

06:01.883 --> 06:05.582
Go and be free,
Lactose, my gentle friend.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.022
You know what that
beautiful display of friendship

06:09.064 --> 06:10.195
reminds me of?

06:10.239 --> 06:11.849
The fact that
I'm running out of time

06:11.893 --> 06:13.503
to get this gift to Batman.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.505
Chill, bro,
we'll get you there.

06:15.549 --> 06:16.506
But how?

06:16.550 --> 06:17.550
We could do that.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.773
Yeehaw.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.428
Well,
that's a helpful coincidence.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.691
Please, what is the Gurning?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.563
Gurning is
when you contort your face

06:29.606 --> 06:31.565
into a grotesque expression.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.132
Like this.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.482
Or this.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.442
Or this.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.532
That be hilarious, yo.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.229
That car will be ours.

06:44.273 --> 06:47.755
Titans, go to the Tri-county
Gurning Championship.

06:54.675 --> 06:57.417
Woah! Check this place out.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.896
So many of the people,

06:58.940 --> 07:01.551
with so few of the teeth.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.641
I can't believe
this is an actual sport.

07:04.685 --> 07:05.947
It's not as easy as it looks,

07:05.990 --> 07:07.470
it takes years of practicing

07:07.514 --> 07:10.255
poor oral hygiene and
a few minutes of Gurn training.

07:10.299 --> 07:13.258
Titans,
keep your eyes on the prize.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.435
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:15.478 --> 07:17.480
let the Gurning begin.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.879
Oh, yeah,
I'mma gurn it up.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.103
I yearn for the gurn.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.980
Feel the gurn.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.464
I don't gurn.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.815
Don't worry, team,
I got this.

07:47.858 --> 07:49.730
I was born to gurn.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.175
Ladies and Gurnlemen.

08:00.218 --> 08:02.960
The moment
you've all been gurning for...

08:03.004 --> 08:05.615
- The Gurning Finals.

08:05.659 --> 08:09.358
In the red corner is Cyborg.

08:09.401 --> 08:14.319
And in the blue corner,
the six-time gurning champion

08:14.363 --> 08:17.627
- Potato face.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.630
Gentlemen,
get your gurn on.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.550
You've gots this, Cy.

08:38.692 --> 08:42.043
The winner...
Cyborg.

08:47.614 --> 08:48.658
Nobody cares about that.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.530
We just won a car.

08:55.752 --> 08:57.537
Gah! This is a disaster.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.103
We're still stuck here.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.192
And we don't even know
where "here" is.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.542
Friends, look.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.066
It's the clown bus, yo.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.381
Those clowns
must have used my spell book

09:16.425 --> 09:18.688
and accidentally turned
themselves into fish zombies.

09:18.732 --> 09:19.732
Run!

09:39.317 --> 09:41.450
Oh, this looks
like the end.

09:44.496 --> 09:47.238
Any moment,
those fish zombies are
gonna rip us limb from limb.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.414
And the worst part is
that I have once again

09:49.458 --> 09:51.503
failed to get
Batman's approval.

09:57.814 --> 09:59.033
Lactose!

10:02.776 --> 10:03.951
Nothing's fate honey.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.480
I can't wait to see
the look on Batman's face

10:11.523 --> 10:12.960
when he opens this.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.746
Ooh, what does the note say?

10:23.492 --> 10:25.537
Just leave the gift, then?

10:30.891 --> 10:32.849
What else does it say?

10:32.893 --> 10:36.984
Nothing just,
"Your pal, Batman."

10:39.813 --> 10:42.163
I am sorry,
friend Robin.

10:42.206 --> 10:43.686
Sorry? For what?

10:43.730 --> 10:44.948
Did you hear that?

10:44.992 --> 10:47.211
"Your pal, Batman."

10:47.255 --> 10:48.865
I'm Batman's pal!

10:48.909 --> 10:51.694
You're not Batman's pal,
'cause I'm Batman's pal.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.654
♪ <i>The Dark Knight likes me
The Dark Knight likes me ♪</i>

10:54.697 --> 10:56.133
<i>♪ We're total besties</i>

10:56.177 --> 10:58.658
- I'm pretty sure
that wasn't directed at...

10:59.833 --> 11:02.531
You're not Batman's pal,
'cause I'm Batman's pal.
