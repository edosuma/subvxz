02:34.687 --> 02:36.655
Feels heavy.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.953
Baby's first tricorder?

02:39.025 --> 02:40.458
Not exactly.

02:40.527 --> 02:42.586
Hmm...

02:48.501 --> 02:50.469
Thank you.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.731
l'm sure she'll love it.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.329
What is it?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.668
A pleenok.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.438
Vulcans use them to train
their infants in primary logic.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.742
Never too early to train
those synapses, eh, Tuvok?

03:01.814 --> 03:03.008
Here, let me see that.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.276
l love a good puzzle.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.342
This one's from Mr. Kim.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.618
Starfleet diapers.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.958
Standard issue.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.894
At least we'll know who to call
if there's a containment breach.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.503
Now that your Borg implants

03:24.604 --> 03:26.936
have been removed,
you might think about

03:27.006 --> 03:28.837
having children
of your own one day.

03:28.908 --> 03:30.637
One day.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.702
l have been considering
some less radical changes

03:33.780 --> 03:34.769
in my personal life.

03:34.847 --> 03:35.779
Such as?

03:35.848 --> 03:36.940
l realize l don't

03:37.083 --> 03:39.779
have a rank, but l would
like to request a uniform.

03:39.852 --> 03:42.082
Consider it done.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.783
The Doctor tells me you don't
need to regenerate anymore.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.654
l can arrange
some quarters for you,

03:46.726 --> 03:49.786
unless you enjoy curling up
in the cargo bay.

03:49.862 --> 03:52.126
A bed would be more comfortable.

03:52.198 --> 03:55.656
Since l arrived on Voyager,

03:55.735 --> 03:58.670
your guidance
has been invaluable.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.205
Thank you, Captain.

04:00.306 --> 04:03.605
All l did was chart the course.

04:03.676 --> 04:05.473
You were the one
who made the journey.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.607
Seven.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.875
lt's traditional for everyone

04:09.983 --> 04:11.712
to share their best wishes
for the baby.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.342
l thought you might like
to start.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.260
To the newest member
of our crew...

04:22.328 --> 04:24.125
may all her desires be fulfilled

04:24.197 --> 04:25.255
except for one...

04:25.331 --> 04:27.697
so she'll always have
something to strive for.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.359
-Oh, very good.
-Well said.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.096
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.671
And may she inherit

04:32.739 --> 04:34.639
a sense of logic
from her mother.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.698
l'll drink to that.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.170
That was strange.

04:41.247 --> 04:42.578
Care to explain?

04:42.649 --> 04:43.946
l wish l could.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.247
Long-range sensors picked up
an energy discharge,

04:46.319 --> 04:47.308
but now it's gone.

04:48.588 --> 04:49.714
There.

04:49.789 --> 04:50.949
There's another one.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.855
They're occurring approximately
5.9 light-years ahead.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.484
-Source?
-We're too far

04:55.561 --> 04:56.687
to get a clear reading.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.560
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.757
Go ahead.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.663
Report to the Astrometrics Lab.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.668
Acknowledged.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.966
Computer, end program.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.280
l wasn't able to find the
cause of the discharges,

05:19.352 --> 05:20.614
but the region ahead contains

05:20.687 --> 05:22.348
unusual amounts
of subspace radiation

05:22.422 --> 05:23.480
and metallic debris.

05:23.556 --> 05:24.580
Vessels?

05:24.657 --> 05:25.646
Not within range,

05:25.725 --> 05:28.353
but l'll have more data
once we move closer.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.827
l see no reason to alter course.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.193
Keep an eye on your sensors.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.253
Yes, Captain.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.560
Now...

05:33.633 --> 05:35.157
on to more pressing matters.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.997
Does B'Elanna suspect anything?

05:37.103 --> 05:38.127
Not a clue.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.761
Good. Mess Hall, 1400 hours.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.863
Be on time; l don't want
to spoil the surprise.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.135
l expect both of you
to show up.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.404
l'll be busy here.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.775
What's wrong, Seven?

05:46.846 --> 05:49.076
No baby showers
in the collective?

05:49.148 --> 05:51.776
l'm sure you can
spare a few minutes.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.052
lf it's any consolation,

05:57.123 --> 05:59.785
l share your discomfort
with social gatherings.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.986
They seem to occur
with alarming frequency.

06:02.095 --> 06:06.054
Mr. Neelix would argue
that they improve morale.

06:06.099 --> 06:09.830
l have been looking for ways
to improve my social skills.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.971
Perhaps l'll attend.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.998
Well, it certainly is,
uh... efficient.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.601
No clutter.

06:19.679 --> 06:24.548
Plenty of room to move around.

06:25.818 --> 06:28.013
Eh, but it's
a little impersonal.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.349
Don't you think?

06:29.422 --> 06:31.014
Explain.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.081
Well, these are your quarters,
Seven.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.286
They should reflect
your individuality.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.819
How about a table
and a couple of chairs?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.627
Give yourself a place to work...

06:40.700 --> 06:42.224
entertain guests.

06:42.335 --> 06:45.736
Uh, try to add a little color.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.865
Uh, uh, photographs, uh,
artwork, knickknacks.

06:48.975 --> 06:49.942
Knickknacks?

06:50.009 --> 06:50.941
Little things,

06:51.077 --> 06:53.944
like the wood carvings
in Ensign Kim's quarters.

06:54.013 --> 06:56.743
l've never been
to Ensign Kim's quarters.

06:56.816 --> 06:58.909
But l suppose l could
replicate some items

06:58.985 --> 07:00.816
and disperse them
throughout the room.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.514
That's a start.

07:02.588 --> 07:06.046
Some people like to display
pictures of family and friends.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.615
There's a photograph
of my parents

07:07.693 --> 07:08.682
in the ship's database.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.456
l'll make a copy
and place it in a frame.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.656
Good, good.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.827
A multispectral starchart
might enhance this bulkhead.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.765
Or a painting.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.360
A painting of a starchart.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.997
l-l was thinking of something
more abstract,

07:22.108 --> 07:24.076
more, uh, artistic.

07:24.143 --> 07:25.440
Uh, drapes.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.810
Nothing livens up a room
like good window dressing.

07:28.881 --> 07:30.974
Not to mention
the added privacy.

07:31.050 --> 07:31.982
Privacy?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.643
We're in space.

07:33.719 --> 07:34.743
Well, you never know

07:34.821 --> 07:36.721
when we'll be docking
at a crowded spaceport.

07:36.789 --> 07:40.555
But we'll have to make sure
that they match the carpet.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.992
l'm thinking
of a Talaxian mosaic, uh,

07:43.062 --> 07:45.292
tulaberry blue stripes
with an orange inlay...

07:45.364 --> 07:47.229
l appreciate
your aesthetic insights,

07:47.300 --> 07:50.531
but l believe l can
proceed on my own.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.103
Enter.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.568
Am l interrupting?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.370
Please come in.

07:57.443 --> 08:00.708
Love what you've done
with the place.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.145
We're in the process
of decorating.

08:02.215 --> 08:05.673
Maybe this will help.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.049
Consider it a housewarming gift.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.712
lt's beautiful.
What is it?

08:09.789 --> 08:10.813
A dreamcatcher.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.619
According to Native
American mythology,

08:12.692 --> 08:15.183
it wards off nightmares.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.489
l'm impressed.

08:16.562 --> 08:20.293
l've familiarized myself
with your culture.

08:20.366 --> 08:23.130
Now that you'll be sleeping
instead of regenerating,

08:23.236 --> 08:24.965
l thought it might
come in handy.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.732
l'm sure it will.

08:26.839 --> 08:27.965
Thank you.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.305
l'll let you two
find a place to hang that.

08:31.377 --> 08:36.178
But it would look perfect
right above the bed.

08:36.249 --> 08:38.774
Pleasant dreams.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.856
lt was thoughtful
of you to stop by.

08:43.923 --> 08:44.855
On move-in day?

08:44.924 --> 08:45.856
l wouldn't miss it.

08:45.925 --> 08:48.018
l suppose this makes you
my inaugural guest.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.562
l'd be a negligent host

08:50.630 --> 08:52.063
if l didn't offer you
a beverage.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.120
Tea?

08:53.199 --> 08:56.828
That might be difficult.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.904
No replicator.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.768
Another flaw in the decor.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.273
l'll requisition one

09:02.341 --> 09:03.865
for you first thing tomorrow.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.240
l'd appreciate that, Commander.

09:06.312 --> 09:09.008
Chakotay.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.207
We're off-duty.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.547
We can drop the formalities.

09:12.618 --> 09:13.642
Yes, sir.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.913
l enjoyed your toast today.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.550
You've come a long way.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.059
l hope to see more.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.722
You will.

09:26.365 --> 09:28.230
Good night.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.235
Chakotay.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.032
As you might know,

09:32.138 --> 09:34.800
l've taken an interest
in culinary science.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.171
l'm preparing a meal
tomorrow night,

09:37.243 --> 09:39.871
and l thought perhaps
you could attend...

09:39.979 --> 09:41.776
to evaluate my work.

09:41.847 --> 09:43.405
l'd be happy to.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.074
1900 hours?

09:45.151 --> 09:47.244
l'll bring the wine...
and the furniture.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.844
Then you accept?

09:48.921 --> 09:50.946
lt's a date.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.061
Rock-a-bye baby,
in the space dock

10:05.171 --> 10:08.607
When the core blows,
the shuttle will rock

10:08.674 --> 10:11.643
When the hull breaks,
the shuttle will fall

10:11.744 --> 10:15.373
And down will come baby,
shuttle and all...

10:15.448 --> 10:17.848
Are you trying to soothe
the infant or traumatize her?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.044
The lyrics are rather grim,

10:20.119 --> 10:21.814
but it's the melody
they respond to.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.912
l recorded 29 in all,

10:23.990 --> 10:26.185
including a couple
of Klingon lullabies.

10:26.258 --> 10:29.750
My favorite is
''quong vaj Ocht. ''

10:29.829 --> 10:31.763
''Sleep, Little Warrior.''

10:31.831 --> 10:33.890
l could tell by the look
on their faces

10:33.966 --> 10:35.957
that my gift made
quite an impression.

10:36.102 --> 10:37.569
No doubt.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.661
l wish you'd been there.

10:38.771 --> 10:39.760
lt was a lovely shower.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.863
Tom and B'Elanna
were disappointed

10:41.974 --> 10:43.373
that you didn't attend.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.137
l was occupied.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.476
Are you experiencing
any shoulder pain?

10:48.547 --> 10:49.639
Yes.

10:49.715 --> 10:50.841
Hmm.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.578
Your biradial clamp is out
of alignment by .3 microns.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.484
l'm afraid it'll have
to be repaired.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.749
Can't you simply extract
the component?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.189
Not if you want to keep
using that arm.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.894
l know it's an inconvenience,
but until we can find a way

11:04.030 --> 11:05.554
to remove
your cybernetic systems,

11:05.631 --> 11:07.030
they'll have to be maintained.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.329
lt's a minor procedure.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.460
We might as well
take care of it now.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.502
l prefer to wait.

11:12.571 --> 11:13.902
We'll be done in an hour.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.497
l have research to complete.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.769
Oh.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.802
l suppose we can put it off
until next week's physical.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.941
l also noticed that
your electrolyte levels

11:25.051 --> 11:26.211
are down by 12 percent.

11:26.285 --> 11:29.413
Have you missed any
regeneration cycles?

11:29.488 --> 11:30.819
Last night.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.448
Don't tell me.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.514
More...

11:33.592 --> 11:35.560
research?

11:35.628 --> 11:37.960
This must be some project.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.089
Mind if l ask
what you're working on?

11:40.166 --> 11:41.098
lt's complicated.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.098
How do you mean?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.829
My personal life is
none of your concern.

11:47.606 --> 11:50.040
l wasn't aware you
had a personal life.

11:51.410 --> 11:52.570
Report?

11:52.645 --> 11:56.012
lt was an energy discharge,
200,000 kilometers starboard.

11:56.148 --> 11:58.616
lt produced
a level-9 shock wave.

11:58.684 --> 11:59.912
Some kind of weapon?

11:59.985 --> 12:01.247
Possibly.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.583
Another one, five million
kilometers to port.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.613
A shock wave is approaching.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.125
Full power to the shields.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.097
Our warp field's destabilizing.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.669
l'm detecting another.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.670
Distance: 50,000 kilometers.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.798
Turn our bow
into the wave front.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.101
lt'll minimize the damage.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.670
Sorry, Captain,
there wasn't enough time.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.270
We've lost warp drive.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.746
l'm reading another.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.544
Distance:
26 million kilometers.

12:31.617 --> 12:32.948
Too far to pose a threat.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.279
lf they are weapons,

12:34.353 --> 12:36.685
they don't seem
to be directed at us.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.350
Or whoever's firing them
is a lousy shot.

12:39.425 --> 12:43.486
Astrometric sensors
recorded the explosions.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.156
l believe it's
a long-range subspace warhead.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.427
The debris in this region

12:48.534 --> 12:49.728
suggests that dozens
have been fired

12:49.835 --> 12:50.961
in the last several weeks.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.627
The warhead destroyed something.

12:52.738 --> 12:53.670
What was it?

12:53.739 --> 12:55.297
lt appeared to be
an unmanned probe.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.669
This is all very intriguing,

12:56.742 --> 12:58.403
but l'd just as soon
get out of here

12:58.477 --> 13:01.037
before we cross paths with
another one of these things.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.512
Where do we stand on repairs?

13:02.581 --> 13:04.515
Subspace radiation
from the explosions

13:04.583 --> 13:07.381
is making it difficult
to create a stable warp field.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.387
Lieutenant Torres
estimates 48 hours.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.616
Can you find a way
to detect the warheads

13:11.690 --> 13:13.453
before they emerge
from subspace?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.515
l believe so.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.561
The weapons create
minor gravimetric distortions

13:16.629 --> 13:17.994
as they approach
the subspace barrier,

13:18.063 --> 13:20.327
but l'll need to recalibrate
my sensors

13:20.399 --> 13:21.696
to isolate the effect.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.996
Do it. Even a few seconds'
warning would help us.

13:24.103 --> 13:26.731
Yes, Captain.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.636
Your duty shift doesn't
begin for two hours.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.080
The Doctor sent me
to relieve you early.

13:38.150 --> 13:41.551
He wants you to spend
more time regenerating.

13:41.620 --> 13:44.487
l see he's enlisted an ally.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.957
''Don't kill the messenger.''

13:47.026 --> 13:49.426
lt's Sophocles-- Oedipus Rex.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.464
l've been studying
Earth literature

13:52.531 --> 13:54.761
as a part
of my Academy training.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.734
Continue these scans
of the subspace barrier.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.738
Look for any
gravimetric distortions.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.295
Run another diagnostic
on the injector ports.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.664
Make sure they're aligned.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.065
They're aligned.
l checked.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.137
Check again.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.364
Come to join the fun?

14:33.472 --> 14:35.940
We're trying to cold-start
the warp core...

14:36.008 --> 14:37.134
for the 15th time.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.769
Perhaps this will
enhance your day.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.905
lt's a belated gift
for your baby shower.

14:42.982 --> 14:45.576
l apologize for my absence.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.209
Oh.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.947
Proceed.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.356
They're lined
with biothermal insulation.

14:55.427 --> 14:57.395
Your infant's feet
will be protected,

14:57.463 --> 14:59.522
even if the external
temperature drops

14:59.598 --> 15:01.225
below minus 40 degrees Celsius.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.666
Well, they're certainly unique.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.102
Thank you.

15:06.171 --> 15:07.468
You're welcome.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.068
l wish to ask you
a personal question.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.943
Shoot.

15:19.351 --> 15:22.343
You have an appealing coiffure.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.854
What is your grooming regimen?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.291
You're asking me what
l do with my hair?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.850
Yes.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.729
Oh, well, nothing too elaborate.

15:33.799 --> 15:38.293
Sonic shower...
a little engine grease.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.837
Thinking about a new look?

15:39.905 --> 15:40.894
Perhaps.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.304
l'll keep you apprised
if you'd like.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.036
Please do.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.581
Was that Seven of Nine?

15:50.649 --> 15:53.812
There must be an alien
intruder on board.

15:56.088 --> 15:59.524
Computer, make the following
modifications to holodeck file:

15:59.591 --> 16:02.287
Seven of Nine Alpha-3,
Personal Quarters.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.692
Modifications complete.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.754
Begin program.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.046
You look perfect.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.912
Give me a hand with this?

16:26.585 --> 16:28.883
l'm surprised
your Starfleet training

16:28.988 --> 16:30.888
didn't include cork extraction.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.754
l must have been sick that day.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.164
Looks like wine's off the menu.

16:40.232 --> 16:42.359
Unless you brought a phaser.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.663
Never on the first date.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.238
Assist me.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.580
Slice these vegetables
transversally

16:56.648 --> 16:58.343
in five-millimeter increments.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.681
Aye, aye.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.186
That smells delicious.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.915
Our appetizer is braised leeks.

17:04.990 --> 17:08.756
Primary course: rack of lamb
with wild rice.

17:08.827 --> 17:10.351
No dessert?

17:10.429 --> 17:13.227
Dessert will be a surprise.

17:15.567 --> 17:17.057
l can't wait.

17:17.169 --> 17:20.605
Does this contain enough
sodium chloride for your taste?

17:29.415 --> 17:32.509
Could use another
.6 milligrams,

17:32.584 --> 17:34.051
but you're the chef.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.992
l concur. More salt.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.032
Liszt?

17:54.139 --> 17:55.663
Chopin.

17:55.774 --> 17:57.674
l've discovered
that classical music

17:57.743 --> 17:59.870
has intriguing
mathematical properties.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.003
Do you play an instrument?

18:01.113 --> 18:03.604
The Doctor's been
giving me piano lessons.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.981
l'd love to hear you play.

18:06.051 --> 18:08.611
l require more practice.

18:13.559 --> 18:15.789
Your technique is flawed.

18:15.861 --> 18:18.728
Sorry. l'm a replicator man.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.595
Use your left hand
to guide the food.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.928
Observe closely.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.808
Pay attention to the vegetable.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.350
You're beautiful
when you're chopping.

18:57.269 --> 19:00.932
l don't mean to sound
like an old holonovel,

19:01.006 --> 19:03.201
but you've got
a wonderful smile.

19:03.275 --> 19:07.803
lt wasn't a smile;
it was a smirk.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.142
Oh, no, it was a smile.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.445
l could check the internal
sensors if you'd like.

19:15.621 --> 19:17.885
Remain still.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.435
You have an intriguing
facial structure.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.669
l'll take that as a compliment.

20:10.909 --> 20:14.174
l require more practice.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.544
You're doing just fine.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.550
What's wrong?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.783
Nothing.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.879
l wasn't aware
you had a personal life.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.831
Chakotay to Seven of Nine.

21:15.941 --> 21:20.105
Chakotay to Seven.
Respond.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.440
Go ahead.

21:21.513 --> 21:22.946
Report to Astrometrics.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.844
We've found something.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.077
Yes, Commander.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.821
Good morning.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.697
Good morning.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.498
You found something.

21:50.609 --> 21:51.576
At first we thought

21:51.643 --> 21:53.338
it was another one
of the probes,

21:53.412 --> 21:55.880
then lcheb picked up
an automated transmission.

21:55.947 --> 21:58.347
lt's a warning beacon.

21:58.417 --> 22:03.480
You have entered
Subspace Munitions Range 434.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.716
Evacuate immediately.

22:05.791 --> 22:10.091
Apparently, this entire region
is an alien testing ground.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.857
We've been sending
out emergency hails,

22:11.930 --> 22:12.988
but so far, no response.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.259
Whoever's conducting
these tests

22:14.333 --> 22:16.062
could be dozens
of light-years away.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.296
Any progress detecting
their warheads?

22:19.404 --> 22:20.735
Not yet.

22:25.677 --> 22:26.837
You seem a little distracted.

22:26.912 --> 22:27.936
l'm fine.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.447
lt's not like you
to be late for a duty shift.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.143
Rough night?

22:33.218 --> 22:35.778
Not at all.

22:35.854 --> 22:39.346
l'll be on the Bridge
if you find anything.

22:42.994 --> 22:45.155
''Better late than never.''

22:45.230 --> 22:46.959
Titus Livius,
A History of Rome.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.124
You're relieved.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.637
Get some rest.

23:28.507 --> 23:29.496
Bravo.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.632
You approve?

23:30.742 --> 23:33.939
Approve? l'm amazed.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.842
l was expecting ''Chopsticks.''

23:35.914 --> 23:37.472
l had no idea you were so good.

23:37.549 --> 23:40.313
The Doctor's
an efficient instructor.

23:40.385 --> 23:41.477
lt won't be long

23:41.553 --> 23:44.147
before you're giving a recital
for the entire crew.

23:44.222 --> 23:46.713
The Doctor did suggest
that l accompany him

23:46.792 --> 23:49.955
during his next
operatic performance.

23:50.061 --> 23:52.086
Your turn.

23:52.164 --> 23:55.531
Mmm... unfortunately,
l don't play.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.591
But l'd love to hear you again.

23:57.702 --> 24:00.330
And this...

24:00.439 --> 24:01.906
is one of my favorites.

24:27.899 --> 24:29.059
You want me to stop?

24:29.167 --> 24:32.659
No. l want you to play.

24:32.771 --> 24:36.104
l don't understand.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.038
Look.

24:37.108 --> 24:39.736
Your technique is flawless,

24:39.811 --> 24:42.746
but try to put a little
more heart into the piece.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.372
More of yourself.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.395
That's all right.

24:57.462 --> 25:00.329
Keep going.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.003
Tell me what you're feeling.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.235
My tempo is erratic.

25:11.309 --> 25:12.571
Not what you're thinking.

25:12.644 --> 25:15.579
What you're feeling.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.478
Your emotions.

25:17.549 --> 25:19.779
Frustration, anxiety.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.113
Stop thinking about the notes.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.448
Just play.

25:23.855 --> 25:24.913
l can't.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.882
Yes, you can.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.893
Don't you see what's happening?

25:30.028 --> 25:32.519
The metronome
is holding you back.

25:32.597 --> 25:33.894
lt gives you a sense of order,

25:33.965 --> 25:36.024
but it also cuts you
off from your feelings.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.895
Remember
when you first came aboard?

25:40.038 --> 25:42.199
The thought of disconnecting

25:42.307 --> 25:44.070
from the hive mind
terrified you.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.804
This is no different.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.971
lt doesn't have to be perfect.

26:26.818 --> 26:29.981
800,000 kilometers
off the starboard bow.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.579
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

26:31.656 --> 26:32.782
Go ahead, Commander.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.586
We need
those sensor calibrations.

26:34.659 --> 26:37.526
l'll need a moment
to return to my station.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.587
That would be a good idea.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.173
Hull fracture, Deck 12.

26:51.242 --> 26:52.800
Seven of Nine, report.

26:52.911 --> 26:54.208
Stand by, Captain.

26:56.081 --> 26:59.949
Lieutenant Paris, isolate
subspace band omicron theta.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.781
Acknowledged.

27:01.853 --> 27:04.651
Direct your sensors
to coordinates 178 mark 26.

27:06.257 --> 27:07.281
Nothing there.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.590
Correction: 178 mark 36.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.996
l can see them.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.930
Two warheads
are about to emerge.

27:16.034 --> 27:17.001
Adjusting course.

27:17.102 --> 27:19.297
Full power
to the forward shields.

27:19.404 --> 27:20.996
lmpact in five...

27:21.106 --> 27:22.835
four... three...

27:22.907 --> 27:24.431
two...

27:30.248 --> 27:31.647
Shields are holding.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.877
Why wasn't Seven at her post?

27:33.952 --> 27:34.884
Good question.

27:34.986 --> 27:35.953
Maybe you should ask her.

27:37.889 --> 27:40.687
lt was your responsibility

27:40.759 --> 27:42.249
to locate those warheads.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.259
l succeeded.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.659
Not before we took
heavy damage.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.993
You told Chakotay you'd have
those sensor calibrations

27:47.065 --> 27:49.033
hours ago.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.602
The work took longer
than l anticipated.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.138
lt might've gone faster
if you'd stayed at your post,

27:54.239 --> 27:55.536
as you were ordered to do.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.770
l didn't realize l was confined
to the Astrometrics Lab.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.868
You were on duty.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.548
This isn't the first time
you've left your station

28:05.617 --> 28:07.585
over the past few days.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.620
Holodeck 2?

28:09.688 --> 28:12.282
You've logged a lot
of time in there.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.824
Mind if l ask why?

28:15.860 --> 28:18.294
Well, it must be something
important, Seven.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.798
49 hours in six days?

28:22.867 --> 28:24.562
l was running a simulation.

28:24.669 --> 28:26.296
Of what?

28:30.508 --> 28:33.170
A new gravimetric array
l've been developing.

28:33.244 --> 28:37.180
l wanted to perfect the design
before l brought it to you.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.773
l appreciate your efforts
to improve our systems,

28:39.851 --> 28:42.513
but l can't have you
dividing your time right now.

28:42.587 --> 28:43.713
When the ship's on alert,

28:43.788 --> 28:45.517
l expect you
to perform your duties.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.218
lf you need to leave your post,
inform Commander Chakotay.

28:48.293 --> 28:49.225
Understood?

28:49.294 --> 28:51.159
Yes, Captain.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.027
l apologize for my lapse
in judgment.

28:54.099 --> 28:57.432
We all make mistakes, Seven.

28:57.535 --> 29:00.026
l've even been known
to make a few myself.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.666
lt sounds intriguing.

29:05.777 --> 29:08.007
Your new gravimetric array.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.014
When this crisis is over,
l'd be happy to take a look.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.209
Maybe l can lend a hand.

29:29.234 --> 29:32.795
l've analyzed the sensor data
from that last barrage.

29:32.904 --> 29:35.202
l've refined
your detection method.

29:38.343 --> 29:42.006
We'll be able to see the weapons
10.3 seconds earlier.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.014
The Captain will be pleased.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.246
Have l offended you?

29:53.158 --> 29:56.321
No. You've done nothing wrong.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.527
l was negligent in my duties.

30:01.599 --> 30:03.794
As a result, Voyager
was nearly destroyed.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.272
l was hoping you could
provide a quotation

30:09.340 --> 30:11.308
to help alleviate my guilt.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.838
l-l can't think of one,

30:15.914 --> 30:18.075
but l'd be happy
to search the database.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.918
That won't be necessary.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.958
Stay here until l return.

30:28.059 --> 30:28.821
Where are you going?

30:30.662 --> 30:32.653
To correct an error.

30:50.548 --> 30:53.608
Computer,
activate Chakotay simulation.

30:59.324 --> 31:00.484
Come in.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.459
l hope you're not allergic.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.224
Antarian moon blossoms.

31:06.297 --> 31:07.389
Extremely rare.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.490
l had to smuggle them
out of Airponics.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.865
Don't tell Neelix.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.907
l thought l'd cook
for you tonight.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.704
How does roasted chicken sound?

31:19.777 --> 31:23.474
l slaved over the replicator
for hours.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.242
Not hungry?

31:31.656 --> 31:34.250
l called you here to thank you.

31:34.325 --> 31:35.792
For what?

31:37.662 --> 31:40.893
The past few days
have been memorable.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.797
To say the least.

31:50.842 --> 31:52.002
You're ending this.

31:52.110 --> 31:55.705
ln a manner of speaking, yes.

31:55.780 --> 31:57.839
Why?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.510
Our relationship is interfering

32:00.585 --> 32:02.314
with my responsibilities
on Voyager.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.820
l could speak to the Captain,

32:03.888 --> 32:05.719
have her cut back
on your duty shifts.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.524
Seven, the past few days
have been more than memorable.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.723
They've been an important
step forward for both of us.

32:13.798 --> 32:14.856
Don't throw that away.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.662
l'm sorry, Commander.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.736
You're making a mistake.

32:18.836 --> 32:22.272
No, l'm trying to correct one.

32:30.148 --> 32:33.311
Ask yourself why
you want to end this.

32:33.384 --> 32:35.249
ls it out of a sense of duty...

32:35.320 --> 32:36.912
or something else?

32:36.988 --> 32:39.252
Every time you move
closer to your emotions,

32:39.324 --> 32:40.416
you back away.

32:40.491 --> 32:42.083
Like hiding behind
that metronome.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.422
Your analogy is flawed.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.394
ls it?

32:45.463 --> 32:48.091
l think you're afraid
that embracing your humanity

32:48.166 --> 32:51.135
will make you weak,
less than perfect.

32:51.202 --> 32:53.193
But think about what
you stand to gain.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.236
lt's irrelevant.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.863
No, it's not.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.442
Real intimacy
with another person--

32:58.509 --> 33:00.909
nothing's more relevant.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.538
l must return to my station.

33:04.615 --> 33:05.547
Stay here with me.

33:05.616 --> 33:06.742
This ship needs me.

33:06.818 --> 33:07.750
So do l.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.752
l can't function this way!

33:09.821 --> 33:11.152
You're not a drone
anymore, you're human!

33:11.222 --> 33:12.154
Stop!

33:13.624 --> 33:15.148
Seven!

33:15.226 --> 33:16.716
What's wrong?

33:21.466 --> 33:23.764
Sick Bay...

33:23.868 --> 33:25.062
medical emergency.

33:25.169 --> 33:26.932
Seven?

33:28.139 --> 33:30.073
Computer, locate Seven of Nine.

33:30.141 --> 33:32.769
Seven of Nine is in Holodeck 2.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.140
What happened?

33:39.217 --> 33:42.584
We were having an argument,
and she just collapsed.

33:42.653 --> 33:45.087
Her cortical node
is shutting down.

33:45.156 --> 33:46.589
She's going into neural shock.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.716
And what happened
to her facial implants?

33:48.793 --> 33:50.886
l thought you removed
all her cybernetic systems.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.259
Computer, end program.

34:18.255 --> 34:19.746
Commander?

34:19.824 --> 34:22.621
lf you're looking for
your other holographic friend,

34:22.693 --> 34:24.251
he's off-line at the moment.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.764
Your cortical node
began to shut down.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.324
Fortunately, l managed
to stabilize it

34:31.436 --> 34:33.130
before there was
any permanent damage.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.465
lt was functioning properly

34:34.572 --> 34:36.096
when you examined me
two days ago.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.108
l'm going to run a diagnostic
on your entire cortical array.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.509
But it might help if l
knew what you were doing,

34:41.579 --> 34:42.806
before you collapsed.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.542
Did you suffer a physical
injury of some kind?

34:45.616 --> 34:46.810
No.

34:46.884 --> 34:48.408
Were you exposed
to any unusual radiation?

34:48.485 --> 34:49.748
No.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.722
What exactly were you
doing in there?

34:54.891 --> 34:56.359
Research.

34:59.697 --> 35:02.029
That simulation
of Commander Chakotay

35:02.133 --> 35:05.591
mentioned that the two of you
were having an argument.

35:05.670 --> 35:10.266
Was that part of your research?

35:10.374 --> 35:12.035
l couldn't help but notice

35:12.110 --> 35:15.307
that you'd created some
quarters for yourself.

35:15.379 --> 35:19.475
A new dress...
dinner for two.

35:19.550 --> 35:25.011
l trust you'll respect
doctor-patient confidentiality.

35:25.089 --> 35:27.387
Of course.

35:30.027 --> 35:33.087
l've been conducting
simulations

35:33.164 --> 35:38.033
to explore different
aspects of my humanity.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.730
Such as?

35:40.838 --> 35:42.169
Social activities,

35:42.240 --> 35:45.573
friendships with the crew...

35:45.643 --> 35:47.611
intimate relations.

35:49.580 --> 35:54.142
l take it our First Officer
is your ''romantic interest''?

35:54.218 --> 35:58.154
Commander Chakotay seemed
like an appropriate choice.

35:58.222 --> 36:01.020
He has many
admirable qualities.

36:01.125 --> 36:03.525
So he does.

36:03.561 --> 36:06.223
What prompted all this?

36:07.632 --> 36:09.031
Unimatrix Zero.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.966
l've been trying to re-create

36:15.072 --> 36:17.336
some of the experiences
l had there.

36:20.778 --> 36:24.737
Ever since it was destroyed,
my life has...

36:24.815 --> 36:27.147
seemed incomplete.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.253
l wanted to feel
those emotions again.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.881
Well...

36:33.991 --> 36:35.652
this is encouraging.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.216
You might be ready

36:37.295 --> 36:39.456
to start forming
deeper relationships.

36:39.530 --> 36:40.895
l'm proud of you, Seven.

36:40.998 --> 36:42.898
Your pride is misplaced.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.559
l intend to delete the programs.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.762
Why?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.465
l can no longer perform
my duties efficiently.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.940
My personal life has
become a distraction.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.908
lt's supposed to be
a distraction.

36:53.978 --> 36:56.276
You simply have to find
the right balance

36:56.347 --> 36:58.076
between work and recreation.

36:58.149 --> 37:00.481
lnform me when you
finish the diagnostic.

37:00.585 --> 37:01.847
Seven.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.150
For what it's worth,

37:04.222 --> 37:06.918
you have excellent taste.

37:08.526 --> 37:11.324
Your quarters...

37:11.395 --> 37:13.556
they suited you.

37:27.178 --> 37:30.204
Antimatter flow: stable.

37:30.281 --> 37:32.272
lnjector ports: aligned.

37:32.350 --> 37:34.215
That should do it.

37:34.285 --> 37:35.752
Torres to the Bridge.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.811
Looks like we've got
warp drive back.

37:37.888 --> 37:39.446
Well done. Tom.

37:39.523 --> 37:41.684
With pleasure.

37:47.932 --> 37:50.093
l'm detecting another
subspace warhead.

37:50.201 --> 37:51.793
Range?

37:51.902 --> 37:52.891
12 million kilometers.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.059
Closing from astern.

37:54.171 --> 37:55.138
Red Alert.

37:55.239 --> 37:56.501
Where's the target probe?

37:56.574 --> 37:58.906
lt's on a totally
different trajectory.

37:58.976 --> 38:00.375
When we engaged the engines,

38:00.478 --> 38:02.969
the warhead must have diverted
from its target

38:03.014 --> 38:04.982
and locked on
to our warp signature.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.482
Evasive maneuvers.

38:06.550 --> 38:08.643
lt's matching our course.

38:08.719 --> 38:10.050
Eight million kilometers.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.611
Can you get a weapons lock?

38:11.689 --> 38:13.122
Affirmative.

38:13.190 --> 38:15.385
Photon torpedoes.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.653
Full spread.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.436
Our torpedoes
have been neutralized.

38:27.505 --> 38:29.132
Five million kilometers.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.764
Bridge to Seven of Nine.

38:30.875 --> 38:31.807
Here, Captain.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.343
Can you get me anything

38:33.411 --> 38:35.345
on the warhead's
internal circuitry?

38:35.413 --> 38:36.744
Stand by.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.210
l have it.

38:39.283 --> 38:41.376
What can you tell me
about the detonator?

38:41.452 --> 38:42.419
The weapon is armed

38:42.486 --> 38:44.579
with proximity
resonance circuitry.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.646
What's the activation frequency?

38:46.724 --> 38:48.749
4.84 gigahertz.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.886
l may be able to disarm it
with an antiresonance pulse.

38:51.962 --> 38:52.894
Do it.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.088
Two million kilometers.

38:54.165 --> 38:55.427
lnitiating the pulse.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.557
Seven, status?

38:56.634 --> 38:59.797
The warhead's rotating
its activation frequency.

38:59.904 --> 39:01.394
lt's still armed.

39:01.505 --> 39:03.200
One million kilometers.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.298
Can you compensate?

39:04.408 --> 39:06.535
Negative.

39:06.610 --> 39:09.135
Captain, l believe
l can disarm the warhead.

39:09.213 --> 39:10.271
How?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.111
By extracting the detonator
with our transporter.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.445
At this velocity?

39:13.517 --> 39:14.950
The device is too small.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.452
You'd never get a lock.

39:16.520 --> 39:20.149
l can use the submicron imager
to focus our targeting scanners.

39:20.224 --> 39:22.624
Please, give me
transporter control.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.522
800,000.

39:27.932 --> 39:31.390
All right, Seven.
lt's up to you.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.663
l have a lock.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.500
Energizing.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.439
The detonator's protected
by tritanium shielding.

39:40.511 --> 39:42.877
l can penetrate it,
but not at this distance.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.971
We'll have to wait
until it's closer.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.641
500,000.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.649
Status?

39:47.718 --> 39:48.685
Not yet, Captain.

39:48.753 --> 39:50.084
Four...

39:50.154 --> 39:51.621
three...

39:51.689 --> 39:52.815
two...

39:52.890 --> 39:55.620
Brace for impact!

40:06.971 --> 40:09.405
Doctor.

40:09.473 --> 40:12.840
You've come to deliver
unpleasant news.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.402
ls it that obvious?

40:16.480 --> 40:19.210
l've completed my diagnostic.

40:19.283 --> 40:23.117
What you experienced
was no malfunction.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.280
Your cortical node
was designed

40:25.356 --> 40:28.086
to shut down your
higher brain functions

40:28.159 --> 40:30.320
when you achieve
a certain level

40:30.394 --> 40:32.123
of emotional stimulation.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.856
Clarify.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.662
lt appears to be
a fail-safe mechanism...

40:37.768 --> 40:40.100
to deactivate drones

40:40.171 --> 40:42.605
who start to regain
their emotions.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.642
Knowing the Borg, it
makes perfect sense.

40:45.743 --> 40:47.142
Finding one's heart

40:47.211 --> 40:49.873
is the surest road
to individuality.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.006
But l'm no longer linked
to the hive mind.

40:52.082 --> 40:54.107
The technology's
built into your node.

40:54.185 --> 40:57.313
lt simply remained
dormant... until now.

41:01.859 --> 41:04.555
Can you repair me?

41:04.628 --> 41:06.528
Possibly.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.758
l've been thinking about a way

41:08.833 --> 41:11.825
to reconfigure
the micro-circuitry.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.564
l won't lie to you, Seven.

41:14.672 --> 41:17.505
lt would entail
multiple surgeries,

41:17.575 --> 41:19.941
and the recovery
might be difficult.

41:20.077 --> 41:22.671
But l believe we could
eventually succeed.

41:22.746 --> 41:24.839
l'll prepare the Surgical Bay.

41:24.915 --> 41:25.939
We can begin tomorrow morning.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.506
No.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.554
Without the procedure,
you won't be able

41:30.621 --> 41:32.782
to continue your simulations.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.917
l've experienced enough
humanity for the time being.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.087
They were only
holographic fantasies, Doctor.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.960
An inefficient use of my time.

41:41.031 --> 41:42.396
You don't really believe that.

41:42.466 --> 41:43.956
The fail-safe device
will ensure

41:44.068 --> 41:45.660
that l'm no longer distracted.

41:45.769 --> 41:47.236
That's the Borg talking...

41:47.304 --> 41:48.737
not you.

41:48.806 --> 41:53.368
As your physician...
as your friend,

41:53.444 --> 41:55.503
l'm asking you
to let me proceed.

41:55.579 --> 41:56.910
l need to regenerate.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.209
Seven...

41:58.282 --> 41:59.715
Good night, Doctor.

42:16.300 --> 42:17.665
Where's the fire?

42:17.768 --> 42:18.666
Fire?

42:18.769 --> 42:20.259
You seem to be in a hurry.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.465
l have to finish my report
on the subspace warheads.

42:23.574 --> 42:25.439
The ship's out of danger,
thanks to you.

42:25.509 --> 42:26.476
You've earned a break.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.442
Why don't you join me
in the Mess Hall?

42:28.512 --> 42:30.571
Neelix is going to give
a cooking lesson:

42:30.648 --> 42:32.548
''Talaxian Tenderloin
in Ten Minutes.''

42:32.616 --> 42:34.709
l'm no longer interested
in cooking.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.116
Then come for the company.

42:36.186 --> 42:37.744
B'Elanna's going to be there.

42:37.821 --> 42:39.482
Tuvok even promised to show up.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.548
lt'll be fun.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.219
l appreciate your offer.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.058
Another time, perhaps.

42:46.130 --> 42:49.065
You know,
you should try socializing

42:49.133 --> 42:51.499
with the crew a little more.

42:51.602 --> 42:53.797
lt might do you some good.
