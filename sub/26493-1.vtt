00:47.050 --> 00:48.540
COACH CALLED IT, SPENCER.

00:48.550 --> 00:49.335
AND COACH IS WRONG.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.911
A'IGHT, LOOK, THEM BOYS

00:51.920 --> 00:53.911
LOOK TO ME, A'IGHT?
IF I GIVE THE SIGNAL,

00:53.920 --> 00:55.911

01:07.670 --> 01:13.370

02:26.250 --> 02:29.049
MAN: SPENCER JAMES?

02:29.050 --> 02:32.088
MY BAD. DIDN'T MEAN
TO, UH, STARTLE YOU.

02:32.090 --> 02:34.627
GEEZ. IT'S, LIKE,
ONE MINUTE

02:34.630 --> 02:37.247
YOU'RE SCORING,
THEN THE NEXT...

02:37.250 --> 02:39.833
ANOTHER DAY IN
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.490
YEAH.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.831
BILLY BAKER,

02:42.840 --> 02:44.626
VARSITY COACH,
BEVERLY HIGH.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.246
BEVERLY HILLS, HUH?
YES, SIR.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.491
I'll CUT TO THE CHASE, SPENCER.
I'VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU.

02:48.500 --> 02:52.289
YOU GOT STRONG HANDS, YOU MATCH
UP WELL AGAINST SINGLE COVERAGE.

02:52.300 --> 02:57.830
SAW THAT FILM ON YOU WITH THE 4 TOUCHDOWNS
AGAINST FAIRFAX LAST SEASON, YEAH.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.047
YEAH, I NEED YOU
TO COME PLAY FOR ME.

03:00.050 --> 03:02.792
PLAY FOR YOU?
PLAY FOR ME.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.336
BUT YOU CAN'T RECRUIT.

03:04.340 --> 03:07.412
I MEAN, I'M SORRY. THOSE ARE
THE RULES. SEASON'S STARTED.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.707
I SWITCH TEAMS, I'M
BENCHED 3 MONTHS. NO.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.246
NOT WITH ME.
I CAN GET AROUND THAT.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.493
NOW, I'M ASSUMING YOU WANT
TO PLAY PRO EVENTUALLY.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.797
AM I RIGHT?
YES, SIR.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.165
YEAH, WELL, I CAN
HELP OUT WITH THAT.

03:17.170 --> 03:19.707
YOU KNOW, SOUTH CRENSHAW,
YOU GOT A STRONG TEAM,

03:19.710 --> 03:22.702
AND BEVERLY HILLS, WE'VE HAD
A COUPLE OF ROUGH SEASONS,

03:22.710 --> 03:24.166
BUT I'M GONNA TURN THAT
AROUND THIS YEAR.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.049
PLUS, WE CAN OFFER YOU
SOMETHING THAT CRENSHAW CAN'T.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.040
IS THAT RIGHT?

03:28.050 --> 03:30.417
A BETTER EDUCATION
AT A SAFER SCHOOL.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.910
I CAN GET YOU
A WAY OUT, MAN.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.456
LOOK, I PLAYED
IN THE NFL, ALL RIGHT,

03:33.460 --> 03:35.542
FOR A COUPLE YEARS
TILL I BUSTED MY KNEE,

03:35.550 --> 03:37.621
BUT I STILL HAVE ALL
THOSE CONTACTS.

03:37.630 --> 03:40.247
I CAN MAKE ALL YOUR
NFL DREAMS A REALITY.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.832
BUT TAKE IT FROM ME,
MAN, FROM EXPERIENCE,

03:41.840 --> 03:46.380
EVERY PLAYER OUT THERE IS JUST ONE
INJURY AWAY FROM NEEDING A BACK-UP PLAN.

03:46.380 --> 03:51.125
LOOK, I APPRECIATE THE
OFFER, COACH, BUT, UH...

03:51.380 --> 03:53.417
I DON'T NEED
A BACK-UP.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.242
THIS IS WHERE
I BELONG.

03:56.250 --> 03:56.876
ALL RIGHT.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.791
YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
YES, SIR. BE SAFE.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.837
YO, SPENCE.
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

04:01.590 --> 04:04.207
NIPSEY HUSSLE: ALL MY LIFE,
BEEN GRINDING ALL MY LIFE

04:04.210 --> 04:07.043
STACKED FIGHTS,
HUSTLE PAY THE PRICE

04:07.050 --> 04:09.667
WANT A SLICE?
GOT TO ROLL THE DICE

04:09.670 --> 04:10.990
THAT'S WHY,
ALL MY LIFE

04:11.000 --> 04:13.378
I'VE BEEN GRINDING
ALL MY LIFE

04:13.380 --> 04:15.587
YEAH

04:37.840 --> 04:39.626
AND SHE'S LIKE THIS
BAD-ASS SPACE BOUNTY HUNTER,

04:39.630 --> 04:41.200
BUT SHE'S ALSO LIKE
A SPIDER PERSON,

04:41.210 --> 04:43.588
SO SHE HAS 8 LEGS
AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF EYES

04:43.590 --> 04:44.546
AND SHE'S TOTALLY HOT.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.086
WAIT, WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

04:46.090 --> 04:48.161
"SAGA," MOM.,
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING?

04:48.170 --> 04:50.161
THERE'S ONLY TWO KIND
OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD--

04:50.170 --> 04:52.548
PEOPLE WHO READ "SAGA"
AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.870
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THE LATTER.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.247
MOM: I'll KEEP THAT
IN MIND, DILLON.

04:56.250 --> 04:59.163
WELL, LOOK WHO
DECIDED TO GET UP.

04:59.170 --> 05:01.912
I'M DEFINITELY UP NOW.
NO HOT WATER AGAIN?

05:01.920 --> 05:04.161
JUST BEHIND ON THE
GAS BILL, THAT'S ALL.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.377
IT'S FINE.
I GET PAID THIS WEEK.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.246
BESIDES, A COLD...

05:08.250 --> 05:10.048
BOYS: A COLD SHOWER
NOW AND THEN

05:10.050 --> 05:11.996
IS GOOD FOR THE SOUL.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.459
HEH. SMART ASSES.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.701
GIRL:
BEVERLY HILLS, THOUGH?

05:21.710 --> 05:22.336
CRAZY, HUH?

05:22.340 --> 05:23.830
YEAH, MAN.
YOU TOLD YOUR MOM?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.160
NAH. YOU KNOW
HOW SHE GETS.

05:25.170 --> 05:27.161
I'M TELLING YOU, THAT
WOMAN DON'T PLAY, MAN.

05:27.170 --> 05:28.581
IF GRACE FINDS OUT
YOU GOT A SHOT LIKE THIS,

05:28.590 --> 05:31.548
YOU'D BE EATING MAYONNAISE
SANDWICHES BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.

05:31.550 --> 05:34.668
MAN, WHAT IS IT WITH WHITE
PEOPLE AND MAYONNAISE?

05:34.670 --> 05:37.298
I DON'T KNOW.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.919
DAMN, SHASSY,
THAT BOOTY LOOKING JUICY.

05:43.380 --> 05:43.835
WHAT?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.296
COOP, THOSE GIRLS
ROLL WITH SHAWN.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.586
YOU REALLY WANT TO
PLAY LIKE THAT?

05:46.590 --> 05:48.490
LISTEN, THAT WEAK-ASS,
WANNABE GANGBANGER

05:48.500 --> 05:49.296
CAN'T TOUCH ME.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.372
PLUS, I GOT YOU
FOR BACK-UP ANYWAY.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.450
DON'T TOUCH ME LIKE THAT.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.747
WHY
WHAT

05:56.630 --> 05:58.496
6 CHAINS ON THIS
CHEST OF MINE

05:58.500 --> 06:00.332
6 CHICKS ON MY CHESTERFIELD

06:00.340 --> 06:02.081
DROP TEXT SAY
SHE LOVES THE BOY

06:02.090 --> 06:04.047
GUESS I GOT THAT
SEX APPEAL

06:04.050 --> 06:05.620
VOLUME, BILLION DECIBELS

06:05.630 --> 06:06.950
HEAR ME COMING
TWO BLOCKS AWAY

06:06.960 --> 06:08.917
I BE THUGGIN' TILL
THE DAY I DIE

06:08.920 --> 06:10.831
MY CURRENT MOOD'S
2PAC TODAY

06:10.840 --> 06:12.547
HOW YOU TALKING
TO MY GIRL, COOP?

06:12.550 --> 06:14.917
THAT'S NOT YOUR GIRL,
SHAWN. IT IS MY GIRL.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.160
SHE ONLY YOURS
WHEN YOU WITH HER.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.797
SHE MINE RIGHT NOW.
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, MAN?

06:17.800 --> 06:19.336
I'll SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO.

06:19.340 --> 06:20.489
WELL, SHOW IT.
WHAT'S UP?

06:20.500 --> 06:21.877
SPENCER: HEY. HEY!
COOP: WHAT'S UP?

06:21.880 --> 06:22.870
SHAWN: WHAT'S UP?
HEY!

06:22.880 --> 06:26.339
WHAT'S UP? YOU BEAT UP
ON FEMALES NOW, SHAWN?

06:26.340 --> 06:29.628
FEMALE, MY ASS.
SHE-MAN, MORE LIKE IT.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.951
WHAT'S UP, HOMIE?

06:46.840 --> 06:48.547
I CAN EXPLAIN.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.369
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

06:49.380 --> 06:53.203
COACH BAKER ALREADY
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

06:53.210 --> 06:54.166
HOW YOU DOING, SPENCER?

06:54.170 --> 06:55.660
HOW COULD YOU NOT
TELL ME, SPENCER?

06:55.670 --> 06:58.492
MOM. DON'T "MOM" ME RIGHT NOW.

06:58.500 --> 07:00.241
SO THAT'S HOW IT IS?

07:00.250 --> 07:02.048
I SAY NO, YOU JUST
GO AROUND ME?

07:02.050 --> 07:03.290
SPENCER, I JUST
WANTED TO HELP.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.371
I DON'T NEED HELP, MAN.
I'M HAPPY WHERE I'M AT.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.745
GRACE: HAPPY?
IS THAT RIGHT?

07:06.750 --> 07:08.377
YOU THINK I DIDN'T HEAR
ABOUT THAT SHOOTING

07:08.380 --> 07:10.200
OVER AT CRENSHAW
THE OTHER NIGHT?

07:10.210 --> 07:12.121
THAT I DIDN'T GET A CALL
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE FIGHT?

07:12.130 --> 07:15.623
YOU'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF
TROUBLE AT THAT SCHOOL FOR YEARS.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.587
I'M A CLERK DOWN AT
THE COURTHOUSE.

07:17.590 --> 07:20.582
I SEE THIS TYPE OF STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.831
GOOD KIDS GONE BAD,

07:22.840 --> 07:23.989
GETTING CAUGHT UP
WITH GANGS.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.879
DID YOU KNOW THERE ARE
OVER 450 ACTIVE GANGS

07:26.880 --> 07:28.496
IN THE L.A. AREA?

07:28.500 --> 07:29.205
NOT HELPING.

07:29.210 --> 07:32.293
LOOK, SPENCER,
I WENT TO CRENSHAW,

07:32.300 --> 07:33.950
BUT SOMEBODY GAVE ME
A CHANCE.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.997
SOMEBODY HELPED ME
FIND A WAY OUT.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.162
PLEASE LET ME
FIND YOU ONE.

07:38.170 --> 07:41.549
I MEAN, HELL, MY OWN
KIDS GO TO BEVERLY.

07:41.550 --> 07:44.087
SO MAYBE YOUR FATHER--

07:44.090 --> 07:48.049
I DON'T HAVE A FATHER,
NOT ANYMORE.

07:48.050 --> 07:51.247
GRACE: COREY LEFT
A FEW YEARS BACK.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.582
HE WENT TO COACH
COLLEGE BALL IN NEVADA.

07:53.590 --> 07:57.663
WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.741
BILLY: OH, WELL,
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.991
THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S A SHAME.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.742
YOU'RE BREEZING BY
AT CRENSHAW,

08:04.750 --> 08:07.708
BARELY CRACKING OPEN A BOOK.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.041
YOU'RE SMART, SPENCER,

08:09.050 --> 08:11.542
AND YOU COULD MAKE
SOMETHING OF YOUR LIFE

08:11.550 --> 08:12.540
BEYOND JUST FOOTBALL.

08:12.550 --> 08:13.585
FOOTBALL IS MY DREAM.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.297
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE
IN THAT DREAM, BUT I DO.

08:15.300 --> 08:21.125
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW WHY
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS SHOT?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.548
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE YOUR DAD.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.746
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.911
YOU'RE PROUD OF
WHO YOU ARE.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.744
AND, SPENCER, I AM
SO DAMN PROUD OF YOU FOR THAT.

08:32.750 --> 08:35.549
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

08:36.250 --> 08:41.700
BUT CHOOSING NOT TO TAKE
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS...

08:41.710 --> 08:44.338
TAKE IT FROM ME,

08:44.340 --> 08:47.628
THAT'S NOT REALLY CHOOSING.

08:49.050 --> 08:51.997
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

08:53.750 --> 08:57.163
TELL ME THAT GOING
TO BEVERLY

08:57.170 --> 09:01.380
ISN'T THE BEST THING
FOR YOU, BABY.

09:04.130 --> 09:06.701
SKYZOO: I'M HERE
FOR THE CROWN

09:06.710 --> 09:11.580
I'M HERE FOR THE CROWN

09:11.590 --> 09:13.160
YO, I'M HERE
FOR THE CROWN

09:13.170 --> 09:15.207
HOP OUT THE WAY
WHILE I'M TEARING THIS DOWN

09:15.210 --> 09:16.792
SHARING ALONG
AND SHARING ALOUD

09:16.800 --> 09:18.541
GET YOU THE STATE OF
THE WAY OF IT NOW

09:18.550 --> 09:20.621
'CAUSE I CAME HERE
TO HOLD UP THE RING

09:20.630 --> 09:22.371
PLAY THE PARADE,
YOU KNOW WHAT TO SING

09:22.380 --> 09:24.166
HERE'S TO THE PEOPLE
WHO KNOW WHO WE ARE

09:24.170 --> 09:25.831
AND KNOW THAT OUR HEART
ISN'T ALL THAT WE BRING

09:25.840 --> 09:27.626
'CAUSE I GOT A FEW TRICKS
UP MY SLEEVE

09:27.630 --> 09:29.701
YOU WALK IN THIS WAR,
YOU'LL BE ITCHING TO LEAVE

09:29.710 --> 09:31.587
MORE FOR THE WIN,
VISION OF ME

09:31.590 --> 09:34.048
IS ANYTHING THAT YOU
ENVISION TO BE?

09:34.050 --> 09:35.290
I CAME FOR THE CROWN

09:35.300 --> 09:36.745
AND THE DIAMONDS THAT
SIT ALL AROUND

09:36.750 --> 09:38.661
AND THE CHAIR THAT
THE LINE'S IN FRONT OF

09:38.670 --> 09:40.877
AND THE STARES FROM
ALL OF THE CROWD

09:40.880 --> 09:42.917
I'M HERE FOR THE CROWN

09:42.920 --> 09:46.550
HEY

09:46.550 --> 09:49.838
WELCOME TO BEVERLY HILLS.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.813
NOW, REMEMBER, YOU'RE HERE
ON AN ACADEMIC PERMIT,

09:56.820 --> 09:59.949
WHICH CAN BE REVOKED IF
YOU DON'T MAINTAIN YOUR GPA.

09:59.950 --> 10:02.476
BUT I'VE SEEN YOUR RECORDS.
THAT SHOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE--

10:02.480 --> 10:06.394
EXCEPTIONAL GRADE AVERAGE,
ABOVE-GRADE-LEVEL TESTING.

10:06.400 --> 10:07.435
YOU WON'T MISS A DAY AT PLAY.

10:07.440 --> 10:12.469
LOOK, NO FIGHTING OR
IT'S OVER. ONE AND DONE.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.629
LOOK, I JUST DID WHAT
I NEEDED TO GET BY.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.863
I KNOW.
SEE YOU AT PRACTICE.

10:18.540 --> 10:19.610
WOMAN: ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN UP.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.783
I WANT YOU ALL TO DO
A SEARCH ON CHROMOSOMAL DNA

10:22.790 --> 10:24.406
AND MAKE A SLIDE ON HOW
IT CONNECTS

10:24.410 --> 10:28.404
WITH LAST WEEK'S
WORK ON PROTEIN.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.997
SPENCER, RIGHT?
YES, MA'AM.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.570
IT'S OK IF YOU DON'T
HAVE A COMPUTER.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.366
JUST PAIR UP WITH
A CLASSMATE FOR NOW.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.782
OK.
THANK YOU.

10:45.410 --> 10:50.189
HEY, TODD. KEEP WATCHING

10:50.200 --> 10:52.532
TODD: WHATEVER, OLIVIA.

YOU CAN SHARE WITH ME.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.447
THANK YOU.

10:58.660 --> 11:02.153
I'll WARN YOU,
MY CHROMOSOMAL DNA KNOWLEDGE

11:02.160 --> 11:03.992
IS NON-EXISTENT AT BEST.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.571
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP WITH THAT.

11:06.580 --> 11:10.118
SALAD BAR, COFFEE CART.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.361
THEY SERVE SUSHI ON FRIDAYS.

11:12.370 --> 11:13.326
SUSHI ON FRIDAY?

11:13.330 --> 11:16.539
AT CRENSHAW, WE GET
SUSHI ON MONDAY, THAT'S ALL.

11:16.540 --> 11:20.113
SMART AND FUNNY.
I'M IMPRESSED.

11:20.120 --> 11:23.192
DAYE JACK:
I WALK A LONELY ROAD

11:23.200 --> 11:26.033
I WALK IT ALL ALONE

11:26.040 --> 11:28.407
THE HOPE IS ALL I GOT...

11:28.410 --> 11:29.320
LEILA KEATING.

11:29.330 --> 11:32.038
BEVERLY HILLS'
RESIDENT SWEETHEART.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.496

RECORD PRODUCER.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.197

THANKSGIVING WITH THE OBAMAS.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.285

SMOKED POT WITH MALIA LAST YEAR.

11:40.290 --> 11:42.748
YOU MUST BE SPENCER.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.572
JORDAN BAKER. QB.
TEAM CAPTAIN.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.150
BAKER?

11:47.160 --> 11:47.945
OH, SO YOU MUST BE--

11:47.950 --> 11:51.159
YEAH, COACH IS MY DAD.
WELL, OUR DAD.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.867
I'll TAKE IT FROM

11:52.870 --> 11:56.079
COME ON, LET ME
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE TEAM.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.617
HEY, THANKS FOR

12:06.370 --> 12:08.828
IT'S A DATE?

12:08.830 --> 12:11.447
BILLY: I'M TELLING YOU,
EDDIE, THIS NEW KID,

12:11.450 --> 12:12.497
NEW KID'S A GAME-CHANGER.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.286
THE TEAM'S GONNA BE
MUCH STRONGER THIS YEAR.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.156
WE'RE GONNA BE
PUTTING UP POINTS.

12:16.160 --> 12:16.991
YOU BETTER,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.365
'CAUSE, AS YOU'RE
WELL AWARE,

12:18.370 --> 12:20.327
THE BOOSTERS PROVIDE FUNDING
FOR OUR SPORTS PROGRAM,

12:20.330 --> 12:23.743
FUNDING THAT'LL DRY UP FAST
WITHOUT A TITLE THIS YEAR.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.820
AND WITHOUT ONE--

12:24.830 --> 12:27.367
OR I'M GONNA BE OUT
OF A JOB. IS THAT IT?

12:27.370 --> 12:28.860
NOBODY'S TALKING
CHANGES RIGHT NOW.

12:28.870 --> 12:32.579
WE JUST--WE NEED TO
TURN THIS AROUND.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.446
OK.

12:34.450 --> 12:35.861
MEET THE CREW.

12:35.870 --> 12:39.693
THIS IS HADLEY, LEILA, AND
UP TOP, LUCY, JJ, AND ASHER.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.441
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
SPENCER.

12:41.450 --> 12:42.360
HEY.
HEY.

12:42.370 --> 12:43.906
I THINK YOU AND ASHER
PLAY THE SAME POSITION.

12:43.910 --> 12:45.366
ASHER: WHAT'S UP, MAN?
OH, RECEIVER, HUH?

12:45.370 --> 12:48.533
YEAH, BROKE THE SCHOOL RECORD
FOR RECEPTIONS LAST SEASON.

12:48.540 --> 12:49.200
ME, TOO.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.157
SO HOW ARE YOU LIKING
BEVERLY SO FAR?

12:51.160 --> 12:51.945
IT'S OK, I GUESS.

12:51.950 --> 12:54.692
I KNOW IT PROBABLY
FEELS LIKE LOST FOOTAGE

12:54.700 --> 12:55.861
OR RICH KIDS
FROM INSTAGRAM,

12:55.870 --> 12:57.941
BUT IT'S NOT SO BAD
ONCE YOU GIVE IT A CHANCE.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.691
I'M SURE IT'LL
GROW ON ME.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.534
HEY, SO LAY IT ON ME.
CRIPS OR BLOODS?

13:03.540 --> 13:04.405
EXCUSE ME?

13:04.410 --> 13:06.651
I'M DYING TO CHECK OUT
A CRIP WALK FOR REAL.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.991
I'VE ONLY SEEN ONE
ON YOUTUBE.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.866
YO, YO, HE'S JUST JOKING,
MAN. IGNORE HIM.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.190
ASHER, YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW A CRIP WALK

13:11.200 --> 13:12.531
IF IT BIT YOU IN
THE DAMN WHITE ASS.

13:12.540 --> 13:15.328
THAT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE
A JOKE TO ME, BRO.

13:15.330 --> 13:18.789
DON'T BE SO SENSITIVE.
SENSITIVE?

13:22.950 --> 13:26.500
HEY, YO, THANKS
FOR THE WELCOME.

13:29.580 --> 13:30.570
ASHER.

13:30.580 --> 13:31.536
WHAT?

13:31.540 --> 13:33.247
I WAS MAKING CONVERSATION.

13:33.250 --> 13:36.288
NO, YOU WERE BEING AN ASS.

13:38.620 --> 13:39.439
HEY.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.282
UM, I'M SORRY ABOUT ASHER.

13:41.290 --> 13:44.749
I KNOW HOW HE CAN COME OFF,
BUT HE'S REALLY NOT THAT BAD

13:44.750 --> 13:46.240
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

13:46.250 --> 13:46.819
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:46.830 --> 13:49.288
I THINK HE'S
INTIMIDATED BY YOU.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.440
I THINK THEY ALL ARE.

13:51.450 --> 13:52.246
THOSE GUYS?

13:52.250 --> 13:55.322
WITH ALL THEIR YEEZYS
AND MAN JEWELRY?

13:55.330 --> 13:56.320
THEY GOT IT MADE.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.573
ME, I HAD TO CATCH
3 BUSES TO GET HERE TODAY.

13:59.580 --> 14:00.991
AND I'VE BEEN WEARING
MY COUSIN RAY'S

14:01.000 --> 14:02.399
HAND-ME-DOWNS
SINCE I WAS BORN.

14:02.410 --> 14:04.651
AND YOU KNOW RAY
LOVES HIM SOME POLYESTER.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.617
OK, DON'T NOBODY
LIKE POLYESTER.

14:06.620 --> 14:11.649
OK, BUT AREN'T YOU SOME LIKE
CRAZY GOOD FOOTBALL PLAYER?

14:11.660 --> 14:13.037
I DO ALL RIGHT.

14:13.040 --> 14:15.532
YOU JUST GOT TO
SEE THE FIELD.

14:17.410 --> 14:18.445
RIGHT THERE, THAT GUY.

14:18.450 --> 14:22.865
GAIT'S OFF, LOOSE HANDS.
YO, YO, HE ABOUT TO FALL.

14:23.450 --> 14:25.191
OH! HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

14:25.200 --> 14:27.441
HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME
I PICKED UP A BALL.

14:27.450 --> 14:33.071
IT WAS JUST A TWITCH OF
THE FINGERS, A LOOK, A TICK.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.570
SO DO ME.

14:34.580 --> 14:38.904
I MEAN, READ ME
OR WHATEVER IT IS.

14:38.910 --> 14:41.242
YOU'RE LIKE
A DEFENSIVE BACK.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.400
A DEFENSIVE BACK?

14:43.410 --> 14:44.241
GEE, THANKS.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.196
I JUST MEAN
YOU'RE CONFIDENT, SMART.

14:46.200 --> 14:49.443
YOU LIKE ATTENTION. YOU
LIKE TO CALL THE PLAYS.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.657
THAT'S NOT THE MOST
INTERESTING THING ABOUT YOU.

14:51.660 --> 14:55.290
I SAW IT THE MINUTE
YOU CROSSED THE YARD.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.941
YOU'RE LONELY.

14:57.950 --> 15:01.363
DEFENSIVE BACKS, THEY
LIKE TO PLAY ON AN ISLAND,

15:01.370 --> 15:04.613
ALWAYS BY THEMSELVES.

15:05.410 --> 15:09.199
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
FOR A SUPER POWER,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.578
BUT NOT EVEN CLOSE, HUH?

15:11.580 --> 15:13.196
I AIN'T ALWAYS RIGHT, SO.

15:13.200 --> 15:15.157
I SHOULD GET TO CLASS.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.449
BUT I'M GLAD YOU
CAME TO BEVERLY.

15:19.450 --> 15:23.034
ME, TOO.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.578
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
LET'S GET IT.

15:32.580 --> 15:34.070
SHOW ME SOMETHING, BOYS.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.243
Y'ALL IN TROUBLE
NOW, BOY.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.110
LET'S GO, BABY.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.157
BOY: BACK UP.
MAN: WALK

15:42.160 --> 15:43.150
NA NA NA NA

15:43.160 --> 15:45.151
AHH!

15:52.120 --> 15:53.440
LET ME SEE YOUR
RUNWAY WALK

15:53.450 --> 15:56.078
MAKE YOUR HEELS CLICK,
MAKE THE RUNWAY TALK

15:56.080 --> 15:57.787
WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.280
CALM DOWN. HEY, YO.

15:59.290 --> 16:00.530
YOU'RE RUNNING
THE WRONG PLAYS.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.077
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
WE ALL WRONG, WE ALL RIGHT.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.072
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE PLAY HERE.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.150
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.652
BILLY: ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
BRING IT IN.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.321
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
MIX IT UP A LITTLE BIT.

16:12.330 --> 16:15.118
ALL RIGHT, SPENCER,
YOU EVER PLAYED SAFETY?

16:15.120 --> 16:16.360
NO, WHY?
GIVE IT A TRY.

16:16.370 --> 16:18.532
MAN, I DON'T PLAY
DEFENSE.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.281
YOU PLAY WHAT 1
TELL YOU TO PLAY.

16:20.290 --> 16:23.942
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
CHANGE MY POSITION? SPENCER.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.497
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE TALKED ABOUT?

16:25.500 --> 16:26.945
MAN, I DIDN'T
COME HERE FOR THIS.

16:26.950 --> 16:28.190
I CAME HERE TO
SCORE TOUCHDOWNS.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.158
YOU CAME HERE TO
PLAY FOOTBALL AS A TEAM.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.243
AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT?

16:34.250 --> 16:35.069
THANK YOU.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.821
YOU GOT ONE OF TWO
CHOICES, SON.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.151
YOU CAN EITHER BE ON
THIS SIDE OF THE LINE

16:39.160 --> 16:41.697
OR THAT SIDE OF THE LINE.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.532
YOU CHOOSE.

16:43.540 --> 16:46.441
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

16:49.080 --> 16:51.868
SET! GO!

16:53.290 --> 16:55.327
MAN: THERE WE GO.
BILLY: ATTA BOY.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.241
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD WORK, SON.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.321
WHOO!
GOOD STUFF.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.241
THAT'S HOW YOU
PLAY FOOTBALL.

17:01.250 --> 17:04.196
YOU BETTER GET
COMFORTABLE THERE.

17:10.010 --> 17:11.751
AND I'M PLAYING WITH A BUNCH
OF GUYS WHO DON'T WANT ME

17:11.760 --> 17:13.296
FOR A COACH WHO SAID
HE'D HAVE MY BACK

17:13.300 --> 17:14.961
AND HE MOVED ME OFF
THE DEFENSE.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.005
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO WHAT,

17:16.010 --> 17:19.219
PLAY ALONG,
HELP THEM WIN THEIR SEASON?

17:19.220 --> 17:20.039
THEN DON'T.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.757
WHAT, THROW THE SEASON?

17:21.760 --> 17:22.921
NO, MAKE IT YOUR SEASON.

17:22.930 --> 17:24.671
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.
I KNOW YOU WILL.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.796
YOU LET SOME
LILY WHITE COACH--

17:26.800 --> 17:29.098
HE'S BLACK.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.135
BLACK?

17:30.140 --> 17:32.928
I DON'T KNOW THEN.
MAYBE HE RIGHT.

17:32.930 --> 17:34.170
MAN, SHUT UP.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.966
LISTEN, MAN, FOR REAL.

17:35.970 --> 17:38.928
BLACK, WHITE, PLAID,
IT DON'T MATTER.

17:38.930 --> 17:40.295
YOU JUST GOT TO DO YOU.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.927
YOU GOT THE GOODS ON
AND OFF THE FIELD.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.888
I KNEW IT FROM THE MOMENT I
MET YOU RIGHT HERE IN THIS PARK.

17:44.890 --> 17:46.847
MAN, I DON'T KNOW, COOP.

17:46.850 --> 17:51.219
THAT PLACE JUST ISN'T
WHO I AM. IT AIN'T ME.

17:51.220 --> 17:53.097
WHAT?
AND THIS IS?

17:53.100 --> 17:56.297
YOU DECIDE WHO
YOU WANT TO BE.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.882
YOU TRIPPING, MAN.

17:57.890 --> 17:59.380
REALLY NOW.
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

17:59.390 --> 18:01.882
TELL ME ABOUT THESE
BEVERLY HILLS GIRLS.

18:01.890 --> 18:04.791
MAN. THEY'RE SKINNY.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.961
SKINNY?
SKINNY.

18:05.970 --> 18:09.133
WHAT? I CAN'T...

18:09.140 --> 18:12.678
AW, MAN.

18:14.550 --> 18:18.180
CAN I HELP YOU,
MR. BEVERLY HILLS?

18:18.180 --> 18:19.545
STAY HERE.

18:19.550 --> 18:22.850
HEY, YO, LEAVE HER
ALONE, SHAWN.

18:22.850 --> 18:23.339
OR WHAT?

18:23.350 --> 18:24.749
OR I REMIND YOU OF
THAT BEATDOWN

18:24.760 --> 18:26.501
I GAVE YOU IN
THE SIXTH GRADE.

18:26.510 --> 18:27.750
TRY IT AGAIN AND SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.

18:27.760 --> 18:31.048
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAYBE I WILL.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.171
WATCH YOUR BACK, BEVERLY.

18:39.180 --> 18:43.344
MAN, ON RADIO: 24-23 LIVE,
LOOK AT THE MOLESTATION...

18:45.010 --> 18:46.250
HEY, HEY.
HELLO.

18:46.260 --> 18:48.251
HI, DAD.
WHAT'S UP?

18:48.260 --> 18:52.219
OK, I GOT SO MUCH.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.426
HEY.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.797
SO IT WASN'T REALLY
WORKING OUT TOO WELL

18:55.800 --> 18:57.711
OUT THERE TODAY,
WAS IT?

18:57.720 --> 18:58.255
HEH HEH.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.796
YEAH, THE NEW GUY
WASN'T REALLY

18:59.800 --> 19:00.790
A TEAM PLAYER, WAS HE?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.791
AH, HE'LL GET THERE.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.132
IN THE MEANTIME, I NEED
YOU TO DO ME A SOLID.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.041
COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE
SPENCER UNDER YOUR WING?

19:08.050 --> 19:11.759
I MEAN, HELP HIM CONNECT
WITH SOME OF THE OTHER FELLAS?

19:11.760 --> 19:14.388
BRING HIM INTO
THE FOLD.

19:14.390 --> 19:15.130
OK.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.791
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU
AND THIS KID, DAD?

19:17.800 --> 19:20.098
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

19:20.100 --> 19:22.421
BY THE GRACE OF GOD,

19:22.430 --> 19:25.502
JORDAN, THE WAY YOU LIVE
IS REALLY GOOD.

19:25.510 --> 19:29.424
I COME FROM SPENCER'S
NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S A TOUGH GO.

19:29.430 --> 19:31.717
THERE ARE A MILLION WAYS
YOU CAN GO WRONG.

19:31.720 --> 19:36.044
I MEAN, YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.599
GUESS I DON'T, YEAH.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.171
LOOK, THE KID
NEEDS A CHANCE,

19:41.180 --> 19:44.673
AND I'M ASKING YOU
TO GIVE HIM ONE.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.921
WOMAN: BOYS,
I MADE DINNER.

19:46.930 --> 19:48.170
YOU ORDERED SUSHI.

19:48.180 --> 19:50.251
SAME THING.
NOT REALLY.

YOUNG MINDS.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.216

22:36.220 --> 22:37.927
LOOK, I WOULD NOT HAVE
RECRUITED HIM

22:37.930 --> 22:41.503

29:06.760 --> 29:07.795
BUT YOU NEED ME MORE.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.007
IS THAT RIGHT?
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, SPENCER.

29:10.010 --> 29:13.048
THIS IS YOUR WAY OUT.
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

29:13.050 --> 29:15.678
I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOUR HELP

29:15.680 --> 29:18.297
OR A WAY OUT.

29:18.930 --> 29:20.500
LOOK, YOU MIGHT RECALL
I WASN'T THE ONE

29:20.510 --> 29:22.217
KNOCKING DOWN
BEVERLY'S DOOR.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.884
YOU CAME, SAID YOU'D
HELP ME GET TO MY DREAM.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.757
AND NOW THAT I GET HERE,
YOU CHANGE MY POSITION?

29:28.760 --> 29:29.795
HOW IS THAT HELPING?

29:29.800 --> 29:32.883
YOU CAN SEE THE FIELD,
SPENCER,

29:32.890 --> 29:35.541
IN A WAY FEW PLAYERS CAN.

29:35.550 --> 29:37.507
LOOK, I MADE A PROMISE,
REMEMBER?

29:37.510 --> 29:39.751
I SAID THAT I WOULD
HELP YOU GET TO THE NFL.

29:39.760 --> 29:42.923
BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I NEED YOU TO SEE THE FIELD

29:42.930 --> 29:44.091
FROM EVERY ANGLE,

29:44.100 --> 29:47.422
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO,

29:47.430 --> 29:49.000
YOU'LL BE UNSTOPPABLE.

29:49.010 --> 29:52.890
LOOK, I'M JUST
GETTING TO KNOW YOU, OK,

29:52.890 --> 29:54.847
BUT I CAN SEE IT
PLAIN AS DAY.

29:54.850 --> 29:55.965
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR A FIGHT.

29:55.970 --> 29:59.133
AND ALL YOUR LIFE, EVERY
BAD DECISION YOU'VE EVER MADE

29:59.140 --> 30:02.041
IS BECAUSE YOUR FATHER
LEFT YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.792
LISTEN TO ME.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.098
BUT THE PATH YOU TAKE NOW,

30:07.100 --> 30:10.138
THAT'S UP TO YOU.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.441
COOP: YOU SEE THESE DUDES?

30:19.450 --> 30:20.565
YEAH, THEY'RE GREAT.

30:20.570 --> 30:22.732
NAH, THEY USED TO BE
GREAT. NOW THEY JUST STUCK.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.198
THEY DIDN'T TAKE THEIR
SHOT WHEN THEY HAD IT.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.738
WELL, I CAN'T KEEP LIVING
WITH A FOOT IN TWO WORLDS, COOP,

30:28.740 --> 30:31.391
FEELING LIKE I DON'T
BELONG IN EITHER.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.697
THEN DON'T BELONG.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.192
TAKE THE BEST OF BOTH
AND YOU BOSS UP.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.272
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO IT.

30:38.280 --> 30:41.068
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.776
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
ABOUT YOU?

30:44.780 --> 30:45.850
WHAT ABOUT ME?

30:45.860 --> 30:48.602
SHAWN?
LOOK, IF I AIN'T HERE--

30:48.610 --> 30:50.396
LISTEN, THAT DUDE
IS ALL TALK.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.482
I GOT THAT HANDLED.
COOP.

30:52.490 --> 30:55.391
I PROMISE YOU,
HE BACKED OFF.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.196
LISTEN, SPENCE.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.646
IF I HAD A TENTH
OF YOUR TALENT, BRO,

30:58.650 --> 31:01.563
I'D SAY FORGET
THIS PLACE AND BOUNCE.

31:01.570 --> 31:03.607
WHO WOULDN'T?

31:03.610 --> 31:07.069
THINK ABOUT DILLON,
YOUR MOMS.

31:07.070 --> 31:09.607
YOU COULD REALLY GET
HIM A BETTER LIFE.

31:09.610 --> 31:12.944
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
THROW THAT AWAY.

31:12.950 --> 31:15.521
AND WHEN YOU'RE LIVING
YOUR BEST LIFE,

31:15.530 --> 31:20.229
ROCKING IT IN THAT
SUPER BOWL CONFETTI,

31:20.240 --> 31:23.983
YOU GONNA THINK OF HOW YOUR
HOMIE COOP SET YOU STRAIGHT,

31:23.990 --> 31:30.066
HOW SOMEWHERE SHE
DYING FOR A DUCATI.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.060
STUPID.

31:33.450 --> 31:37.444
I'M SERIOUS,
THOUGH, MAN.

31:37.450 --> 31:41.023
GEORGE FITZGERALD: IS IT
COLD WHEN YOU'RE DREAMING?

31:41.030 --> 31:43.988
IS IT COLD WHEN
YOU'RE UNDER?

31:43.990 --> 31:46.277
AND WANNA ROLL BACK

31:46.280 --> 31:50.444
ROLL BACK TO YESTERDAY

31:57.320 --> 31:59.106
HEY, HONEY.

31:59.110 --> 32:02.319
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YOU.

32:07.860 --> 32:11.398
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU, SPENCER?

32:14.990 --> 32:18.358
I WANT TO PLAY
IN THE NFL.

32:18.650 --> 32:23.486
I WANT A LIFE BETTER THAN
THE ONE I'VE BEEN LIVING.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.526
LOOK, MAN,

32:26.530 --> 32:29.397
WHAT DRIVES ME TO PLAY
IS MY ANGER, ALL RIGHT?

32:29.400 --> 32:33.189
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE
BETWEEN THOSE WHITE LINES.

32:34.740 --> 32:39.439
AND YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT MY DAD.

32:39.450 --> 32:42.522
I'M ANGRY HE LEFT.

32:44.200 --> 32:50.060
ANGRY 'CAUSE I GOTTA FIGHT
FOR EVERY DAMN STEP I TAKE,

32:50.070 --> 32:53.893
ANGRY MY MAMA CAN'T
PAY THE BILLS.

32:56.200 --> 33:00.444
LOOK, MAN, I GOTTA
DO BETTER FOR HER...

33:02.450 --> 33:03.599
FOR DILLON.

33:03.610 --> 33:05.442
AND BEVERLY WILL
HELP ME DO THAT,

33:05.450 --> 33:07.987
FOOTBALL OR NOT, SO...

33:08.280 --> 33:13.400
I WILL PLAY ANY POSITION
YOU TELL ME.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.359
BUT BEFORE I DO,
I NEED TO KNOW WHY.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.397
WHY ME, MAN?

33:21.320 --> 33:26.394
BECAUSE I WANTED TO WIN,
SPENCER.

33:26.400 --> 33:28.232
I, UH...

33:30.320 --> 33:33.813
I WANTED TO GET BACK

33:33.820 --> 33:38.360
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF WHAT I LOST

33:38.360 --> 33:42.979
WHEN I BUSTED UP
MY KNEE.

33:42.990 --> 33:45.357
BUT THEN I SAW YOU
ON THE FIELD,

33:45.360 --> 33:47.852
AND YOU REMIND ME
OF ME.

33:47.860 --> 33:52.275
NOW, YOU SAY YOU PLAY
BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.850
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

33:53.860 --> 33:57.569
BUT IF WE'RE GONNA
DO THIS,

33:57.570 --> 34:02.736
I'M ASKING YOU TO PLAY
FOR SOMETHING BIGGER NOW.

34:07.780 --> 34:12.399

37:14.400 --> 37:15.856
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
THEY WERE PLANNING.

37:15.860 --> 37:18.192
I WOULD NEVER DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.395
IF I HAD KNOWN--
IT'S OK.

37:19.400 --> 37:24.736
IT'S NOT, BUT

38:04.950 --> 38:06.349
THEY'RE ACCUSING US
OF RECRUITING.

38:06.360 --> 38:07.270
YOU'RE GONNA STAND THERE

38:07.280 --> 38:09.237
AND TELL ME IT'S NOT TRUE?
HE'S A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.480
AND THAT'S WHY
THE FOOTBALL COACH

38:10.490 --> 38:12.390
WENT DOWN TO CRENSHAW TO
RECRUIT HIM, BECAUSE HE'S SMART?

38:12.400 --> 38:14.107
THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY,
NOT WITH THE BOARD.

38:14.110 --> 38:15.487
OK, WHAT IF HE MOVES
TO THIS ZIP CODE?

38:15.490 --> 38:18.448
YO, MY MOMS CAN BARELY
AFFORD TO GIVE ME LUNCH MONEY.

38:18.450 --> 38:23.433
YOU THINK SHE CAN AFFORD
TO MOVE US TO BEVERLY HILLS?

38:23.540 --> 38:24.996
OK, WE'RE GONNA

38:25.090 --> 38:26.489
HOW?

38:26.500 --> 38:29.049
LOOK, FACE IT, COACH,

38:29.050 --> 38:30.666

38:30.670 --> 38:33.833
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.245
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THIS?

38:36.250 --> 38:37.411
SPENCER: NO.

38:37.420 --> 38:41.129
BUT IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO STAY.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.490
LIVING IN BEVERLY HILLS.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.490
JUST DURING THE WEEK.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.458

FOR THE DISTRICT.

38:47.460 --> 38:48.950

OK, JUST SAY THE WORD
AND TI'LL CALL THEM.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.871
NO. I ASKED YOU

39:05.880 --> 39:09.339
A CHANCE AT
SOMETHING MORE.

39:09.340 --> 39:12.878

39:26.340 --> 39:27.990
THIS IS WHAT'S BEST
FOR YOU, SPENCER.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.995
IF YOU CAN DO IT,
MAKE SOMETHING OF YOURSELF.

39:34.590 --> 39:38.128
ALSO, CAN I HAVE YOUR ROOM?

39:38.130 --> 39:42.169
NAH, DEFINITELY NOT.

39:50.250 --> 39:53.880
I'M NOT YOUR DISCIPLE

39:53.880 --> 39:56.247
I CHOOSE HOW I SIN

39:56.250 --> 39:59.959
I'VE GOT A DISTANT MEMORY

39:59.960 --> 40:01.917

40:01.920 --> 40:05.800
SO DON'T SAY
I'M NOT READY

40:05.800 --> 40:11.045
