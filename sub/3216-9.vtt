NARRATOR:
Previously on Supernatural:

00:01.836 --> 00:04.714
-Let's say good night to your brother.
DEAN: Good night, Sam.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.716
JOHN: Hey, Dean.
-Daddy!

00:06.924 --> 00:08.634
JOHN:
Hey, buddy.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.094
Sweet dreams, Sam.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.517
DEAN:
Dad's missing. Help me find him.

00:16.726 --> 00:19.520
The trail for Dad,
it's getting colder every day.

00:19.729 --> 00:22.106
-I wanna find Dad as much as you do.
SAM: I know you do.

00:22.314 --> 00:25.151
DEAN: We'll find Dad.
-Mom's gone, and she isn't coming back.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.072
Don't talk about her like that.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.054
GIRL:
Mommy?

00:56.182 --> 00:58.225
Hey, sweetie.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.604
-Why aren't you in bed?
-There's something in my closet.

01:17.286 --> 01:19.163
See? There's nothing there.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.960
-You're sure?
-I'm sure.

01:31.008 --> 01:34.762
Now, come on. Into bed.

01:40.643 --> 01:42.937
I don't like this house.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.147
You're just not used to it yet.

01:45.231 --> 01:51.278
But you and your brother and me,
we are going to be very happy here.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.822
I promise.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.244
I love you.

02:04.792 --> 02:10.256
-The chair.
-Okay. Right.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.678
The chair.

02:17.596 --> 02:20.057
Just to be safe.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.448
(SCRATCHING)

02:51.589 --> 02:54.925
Please, God, don't let it be rats.

03:14.570 --> 03:17.197
Terrific.

05:03.721 --> 05:04.930
(TRUCK HORN BLARES)

05:12.938 --> 05:15.065
DEAN: All right. I've been cruising
some websites.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.068
I think I found a few candidates
for our next gig.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.698
A fishing trawler found off the coast
of Cali, its crew vanished.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.702
And we've got some cattle mutilations
in West Texas.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.288
Hey!

05:29.830 --> 05:32.624
Am I boring you
with this hunting-evil stuff?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.085
No. I'm listening. Keep going.

05:36.712 --> 05:39.590
And here, a Sacramento man
shot himself in the head.

05:39.798 --> 05:42.092
Three times.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.638
Any of these things
blowing up your skirt, pal?

05:49.725 --> 05:51.727
-Wait, I've seen this.
-Seen what?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.818
What are you doing?

06:07.785 --> 06:09.620
Dean, I know
where we have to go next.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.664
-Where?
-Back home.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.832
Back to Kansas.

06:15.084 --> 06:17.002
Okay, random.
Where did that come from?

06:17.753 --> 06:21.298
All right, this photo was taken
in front of our old house, right?

06:21.507 --> 06:25.177
-The house where Mom died?
-Yeah.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.180
It didn't burn down, not completely.
They rebuilt it, right?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.390
I guess so.
What are you talking about?

06:30.641 --> 06:32.476
Okay, look.
This is gonna sound crazy...

06:32.684 --> 06:35.646
...but the people
who live in our old house...

06:35.854 --> 06:37.731
...I think they might be in danger.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.274
Why would you think that?

06:40.526 --> 06:42.319
Just-- Look, just--

06:42.528 --> 06:44.780
You gotta trust me on this, okay?

06:45.322 --> 06:47.825
-Okay, whoa, whoa. Trust you?
-Yeah.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.952
You gotta give me
a little more than that.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.704
-I can't really explain it is all.
-Well, tough.

06:52.788 --> 06:54.706
I'm not going anywhere until you do.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.587
I have these nightmares.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.923
I've noticed.

07:04.550 --> 07:07.511
And sometimes they come true.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.600
-Come again?
-Look, Dean...

07:13.809 --> 07:19.148
...I dreamt about Jessica's death
for days before it happened.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.819
Sam, people have weird dreams, man.
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.822
I dreamt about the blood,
her on the ceiling, the fire.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.324
I didn't do anything
because I didn't believe it.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.785
Now I'm dreaming about that tree,
our house...

07:31.869 --> 07:33.912
...and about some woman
screaming for help.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.624
That's where it all started, man.
This has to mean something, right?

07:38.834 --> 07:40.794
I don't know.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.921
What do you mean, you don't know?

07:43.005 --> 07:44.715
This woman might be in danger.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.886
-This might be the thing that killed Mom.
-All right. Just slow down, would you?

07:53.015 --> 07:56.185
I mean, first you tell me
you've got the Shining...

07:56.810 --> 07:59.646
...and then you tell me
that I've gotta go back home.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.732
Especially when....

08:02.900 --> 08:04.359
When what?

08:05.152 --> 08:08.572
When I swore to myself
that I would never go back there.

08:17.206 --> 08:18.749
Look....

08:18.957 --> 08:21.919
Dean, we have to check this out.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.545
Just to make sure.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.763
I know we do.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.491
You gonna be all right, man?

08:53.909 --> 08:56.245
Let me get back to you on that.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.917
(KNOCKING)

09:03.669 --> 09:06.046
-Yes?
DEAN: Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.006
-We're with the--
-I'm Sam Winchester.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.884
And this is my brother, Dean.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.095
We used to live here.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.055
You know, we were just driving by...

09:15.264 --> 09:18.141
...and we were wondering
if we could come see the old place.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.935
JENNY:
Winchester.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.646
Yeah, that's so funny.

09:22.854 --> 09:25.816
You know, I think I found
some of your photos the other night.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.026
You did?

09:31.071 --> 09:32.739
Okay. Come on in.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.839
Juice. Juice. Juice.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.676
That's Richie.
He's kind of a juice junkie.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.929
But, hey,
at least he won't get scurvy.

09:57.848 --> 10:02.227
Sari, this is Sam and Dean.
They used to live here.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.396
-Hi.
-Hey, Sari.

10:05.397 --> 10:08.692
-So you just moved in?
-Yeah. From Wichita.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.110
You got family here, or...?

10:11.278 --> 10:14.156
No, I just...

10:15.157 --> 10:17.492
...needed a fresh start, that's all.

10:18.869 --> 10:24.541
So new town, new job--
I mean, as soon as I find one.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.877
New house.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.963
So how you liking it so far?

10:31.089 --> 10:34.509
Well, all due respect
to your childhood home--

10:34.718 --> 10:38.597
I mean, I'm sure you have
lots of happy memories here.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.016
--but this place has its issues.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.559
What do you mean?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.771
Well, it's just getting old.

10:45.979 --> 10:50.192
Like the wiring, you know?
We've got flickering lights almost hourly.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.903
That's too bad. What else?

10:54.446 --> 10:59.034
Sink's backed up.
There's rats in the basement.

10:59.951 --> 11:03.622
-I'm sorry. I don't mean to complain.
-No.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.918
Have you seen the rats
or have you just heard scratching?

11:08.377 --> 11:10.337
It's just the scratching, actually.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.547
Mom?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.637
Ask them if it was here
when they lived here.

11:20.389 --> 11:23.266
-What, Sari?
-The thing in my closet.

11:23.475 --> 11:28.063
Oh, no, baby.
There was nothing in their closets.

11:28.146 --> 11:32.067
-Right?
-Right. No, no, of course not.

11:33.944 --> 11:37.447
-She had a nightmare the other night.
-I wasn't dreaming.

11:37.656 --> 11:42.035
It came into my bedroom,
and it was on fire.

11:42.244 --> 11:44.955
You hear that? A figure on fire.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.290
-That was the woman in your dreams?
-Yeah.

11:47.499 --> 11:50.127
She was talking about
scratching, flickering lights.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
Both signs of a malevolent spirit.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.798
I'm just freaked out
your weirdo visions are coming true.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.049
Forget that a minute.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.260
The thing in the house,
think it killed Mom?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.095
-I don't know.
-Has it come back?

12:00.178 --> 12:03.515
-Has it been there the whole time?
-Or it's something else entirely.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.475
Well, those people
are in danger, Dean.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.477
-We have to get them out.
-And we will.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.521
-No, I mean now.
-How you gonna do that?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.482
-Got a story she'll believe?
-What are we supposed to do?

12:12.691 --> 12:15.068
DEAN:
We just gotta chill out, that's all.

12:15.277 --> 12:18.822
If this was any other kind of job,
what would we do?

12:22.868 --> 12:25.078
We'd try to figure out
what we were dealing with.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.289
We'd dig into the history of the house.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.124
Except we already know
what happened.

12:29.374 --> 12:33.295
Yeah, but how much do we know?
How much do you actually remember?

12:35.172 --> 12:38.008
-About that night, you mean?
-Yeah.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.136
Not much.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.638
I remember the fire.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.724
The heat.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.228
Then I carried you out the front door.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.899
You did?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.319
Yeah. Why, you never knew that?

12:58.737 --> 13:00.655
No.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.326
And, well, you know Dad's story
as well as I do.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.495
Mom was....

13:07.120 --> 13:08.663
Was on the ceiling.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.125
Whatever put her there was long gone
by the time Dad found her.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.462
And he never had a theory
about what did it?

13:15.670 --> 13:18.089
If he did, he kept it to himself.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.301
God knows we asked him
enough times.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.055
Okay.

13:25.263 --> 13:28.266
So if we're gonna figure out
what's going on now...

13:28.975 --> 13:31.728
...we have to figure out
what happened back then...

13:31.937 --> 13:33.522
...and see if it's the same thing.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.357
Yeah.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.069
Talk to Dad's friends, neighbors.
People who were there at the time.

13:40.695 --> 13:44.074
Does this feel like
just another job to you?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.582
I'll be right back.
I gotta go the bathroom.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.599

This is John Winchester.

14:11.768 --> 14:17.774
If this is an emergency,
call my son, Dean. 866-907-3235.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.818
Dad...

14:21.945 --> 14:25.323
...I know I've left you
messages before.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.243
I don't even know if you get them.

14:30.287 --> 14:33.164
But I'm with Sam...

14:33.373 --> 14:35.959
...and we're in Lawrence...

14:36.167 --> 14:39.045
...and there's something
in our old house.

14:39.671 --> 14:43.174
I don't know if it's the thing
that killed Mom or not...

14:43.967 --> 14:45.635
...but...

14:47.012 --> 14:49.347
...I don't know what to do.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.853
So whatever you're doing,
if you could get here....

14:56.187 --> 14:58.148
Please.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.193
I need your help, Dad.

15:06.197 --> 15:10.035
No, sir. Nothing weird down there,
I promise.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.121
-Sink just backed up on its own.
-Well, I'll take a look.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.165
JENNY:
Thanks.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.627
Oh, okay. I'll get out of your way.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.091
(PLUMBER SCREAMING)

17:01.604 --> 17:04.774
So you and John Winchester,
you used to own this garage together?

17:04.983 --> 17:07.527
Yeah, we used to. A long time ago.

17:07.610 --> 17:11.614
Matter of fact, it must be 20 years
since John disappeared.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.533
So why are the cops interested?

17:13.742 --> 17:17.704
We're reopening some unsolved cases,
and the Winchester disappearance is one.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.166
-Well, what do you wanna know?
-Whatever you remember.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.042
Whatever sticks out in your mind.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.591
He was a stubborn bastard,
I remember that.

17:29.799 --> 17:33.553
And whatever the game,
he hated to lose, you know?

17:33.762 --> 17:35.346
It was the whole Marine thing.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.642
But he sure loved Mary.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.978
And he doted on those kids.

17:42.604 --> 17:45.940
-But that was before the fire?
-That's right.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.442
He ever talk about that night?

17:48.985 --> 17:51.446
No. Not at first.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.782
-I think he was in shock.
-Right.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.408
But eventually?

17:56.659 --> 17:57.827
What did he say about it?

17:58.620 --> 18:01.998
He wasn't thinking straight.
He said....

18:02.207 --> 18:05.251
He said something caused that fire
and killed Mary.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.003
He ever say what did it?

18:07.462 --> 18:10.298
Nothing did it.
It was an accident.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.593
An electrical short in the ceiling
or walls or something.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.808
-I begged him to get some help, but....
-But what?

18:20.558 --> 18:23.686
-He just got worse and worse.
-How?

18:23.937 --> 18:26.856
Oh, he started reading
these strange old books.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.109
He started going to see
this palm-reader in town.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.195
Palm-reader? Do you have a name?

18:33.488 --> 18:35.406
No.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.454
So there are a few psychics
and palm-readers in town.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.498
There's someone named El Divino.

18:43.706 --> 18:47.585
There's the mysterious Mr. Fortensky.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.129
-Missouri Mosley. Some dude named--
-Wait, wait.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.549
-Missouri Mosley?
-What?

18:52.632 --> 18:57.262
-That's a psychic?
-Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.517
Dad's journal.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.521
Come here. Look at this.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.525
First page, first sentence. Read that.

19:10.733 --> 19:14.654
"I went to Missouri
and I learned the truth."

19:15.864 --> 19:18.616
I always thought he meant the state.

19:23.746 --> 19:25.164
WOMAN:
All right, then.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.709
Don't you worry about a thing.

19:27.917 --> 19:32.005
-Your wife is crazy about you.
MAN: Well, thank you.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.342
Poor bastard.

19:36.551 --> 19:39.554
His woman is cold banging
the gardener.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.764
Why didn't you tell him?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.100
People don't come here for the truth.

19:44.309 --> 19:46.853
They come for good news.

19:47.645 --> 19:51.900
Well, Sam and Dean, come on already.
I ain't got all day.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.035
Well, let me look at you.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.706
You boys grew up handsome.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.918
And you were one
goofy-looking kid too.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.963
Sam.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.508
Oh, honey.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.889
I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.224
And your father.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.394
He's missing?

20:30.772 --> 20:33.608
-How did you know all that?
-Well....

20:33.816 --> 20:35.944
You were just thinking it, just now.

20:37.528 --> 20:38.821
Where is he? Is he okay?

20:39.739 --> 20:43.826
-I don't know.
-Don't know?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.329
You're supposed to be
a psychic, right?

20:46.537 --> 20:50.249
Boy, you see me sawing
some bony tramp in half?

20:50.458 --> 20:51.793
You think I'm a magician?

20:52.001 --> 20:54.545
I may read thoughts
and sense energies in a room...

20:54.754 --> 20:57.382
...but I can't just pull facts
out of thin air.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.093
Sit. Please.

21:09.102 --> 21:12.605
You put your foot on my coffee table,
I'm gonna whack you with a spoon.

21:12.814 --> 21:15.400
-I didn't do anything.
-You were thinking about it.

21:21.823 --> 21:27.745
Okay. So our dad,
when did you first meet him?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.998
He came for a reading.

21:30.206 --> 21:32.792
A few days after the fire.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.255
I just told him
what was really out there in the dark.

21:37.463 --> 21:42.301
I guess you could say
I drew back the curtains for him.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.679
What about the fire?

21:44.887 --> 21:47.140
Do you know about
what killed our mom?

21:47.765 --> 21:51.769
A little.
Your daddy took me to your house.

21:51.978 --> 21:58.651
He was hoping I could sense the echoes,
the fingerprints of this thing.

21:58.860 --> 22:02.030
-And could you?
-I don't....

22:02.864 --> 22:06.743
-What was it?
-I don't know.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.244
Oh....

22:08.327 --> 22:10.329
But it was evil.

22:10.538 --> 22:14.333
-Juice. Juice. Juice.
-I feel awful about the poor man's hand.

22:15.918 --> 22:19.297
Wait, but how can I be held liable?

22:20.882 --> 22:24.844
Yeah, but I can't afford a lawyer.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.137
(SCRATCHING)

22:26.220 --> 22:29.682
Okay, listen.
You just gotta let me call you back.

22:30.099 --> 22:34.020
Richie, Mommy's gonna
be right back, okay?

22:34.228 --> 22:36.856
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:40.359 --> 22:45.073
So you think something's
back in that house?

22:46.324 --> 22:47.742
Definitely.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.538
I don't understand.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.749
What?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.961
I haven't been back inside...

22:59.045 --> 23:03.591
...but I've been keeping an eye
on the place, and it's been quiet.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.095
No sudden deaths, no freak accidents.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.514
Why is it acting up now?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.307
SAM:
I don't know.

23:11.516 --> 23:16.979
But Dad going missing and Jessica dying
and now this house...

23:17.063 --> 23:21.317
...all happening at once,
it feels like something starting.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.903
That's a comforting thought.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.018
Juice.

24:12.285 --> 24:16.414
Oh, baby, either we have rats
or Mommy is going crazy.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.040
Richie?

24:20.501 --> 24:22.587
Richie!

24:32.013 --> 24:34.765
Baby, where are you?

24:51.365 --> 24:53.826
RICHIE: Mama.
-Oh, my God.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.334
(KNOCKING)

25:03.836 --> 25:06.047
Sam, Dean.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.424
-What are you doing here?
-Hey, Jenny.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.385
This is our friend, Missouri.

25:11.594 --> 25:14.222
DEAN: We were hoping to show her
the old house.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.432
You know, for old times' sake.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.393
You know what?
This isn't a good time.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.938
-I'm kind of busy.
-Jenny, it's important--

25:22.438 --> 25:25.274
Give the poor girl a break.
Can't you see she's upset?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.945
Forgive him. He means well. He's just
not the sharpest tool in the shed.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.863
But hear me out.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.616
-About what?
-About this house.

25:34.408 --> 25:35.952
What are you talking about?

25:36.452 --> 25:38.621
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

25:38.829 --> 25:40.873
You think there's something
in this house.

25:41.082 --> 25:43.668
Something that wants
to hurt your family.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.419
Am I mistaken?

25:46.754 --> 25:49.632
-Who are you?
-We're people who can help.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.259
Who can stop this thing.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.594
But you're gonna
have to trust us just a little.

25:56.389 --> 26:01.769
If there's a dark energy around here,
this room should be the center of it.

26:03.354 --> 26:07.400
-Why?
-This used to be your nursery, Sam.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.485
This is where it all happened.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.670
-That an EMF?
-Yeah.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.047
Amateur.

26:39.682 --> 26:42.435
I don't know if you should be
disappointed or relieved...

26:42.643 --> 26:45.479
...but this ain't the thing
that took your mom.

26:46.772 --> 26:50.067
Are you sure?
How do you know?

26:50.276 --> 26:53.529
It isn't the same energy I felt
the last time I was here.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.240
It's something different.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.658
What is it?

26:59.076 --> 27:02.872
Not it. Them.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.292
There's more than one spirit
in this place.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.753
What are they doing here?

27:08.961 --> 27:11.339
They're here because
of what happened to your family.

27:12.965 --> 27:16.844
You see, all those years ago,
real evil came to you.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.097
It walked this house.

27:20.306 --> 27:23.059
That kind of evil leaves wounds.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.353
And sometimes wounds get infected.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.938
I don't understand.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.942
This place is a magnet
for paranormal energy.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.697
It's attracted a poltergeist.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.408
A nasty one.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.870
And it won't rest until Jenny
and her babies are dead.

27:42.953 --> 27:45.581
You said there was more
than one spirit.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.124
There is.

27:50.169 --> 27:53.923
I just can't quite make out
the second one.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.512
Well, one thing's for damn sure.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.306
Nobody's dying in this house
ever again.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.726
So whatever is here,
how do we stop it?

28:09.397 --> 28:11.399
So, what is all this stuff, anyway?

28:11.607 --> 28:14.902
Angelica Root, Van Van oil,
crossroad dirt.

28:15.111 --> 28:18.447
-A few other odds and ends.
-What are we supposed to do with it?

28:18.531 --> 28:21.742
We're gonna put them
inside the walls...

28:21.867 --> 28:26.580
...in the north, south, east, west corners
on each floor of the house.

28:26.789 --> 28:30.334
We're gonna be punching holes
in the drywall, Jenny's gonna love that.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.545
She'll live.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.966
-And this will destroy the spirits?
-It should.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.429
It should purify the house completely.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.222
We'll each take a floor.

28:43.431 --> 28:47.768
But we work fast. Once the spirits
realize what we're up to...

28:47.977 --> 28:50.020
...things are gonna get bad.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.983
JENNY:
Okay.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.444
Careful.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.239
Look, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
leaving you guys here alone.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.658
Take your kids
to the movie or something...

29:02.741 --> 29:05.744
...and it will be over
by the time you get back.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.289
Okay.

30:03.594 --> 30:05.429
(SCREAMS)

30:07.723 --> 30:09.308
(METAL SCRAPING)

30:20.152 --> 30:21.820
(CHOKING)

30:43.342 --> 30:44.635
Sam!

30:46.720 --> 30:47.763
Sam.

31:34.268 --> 31:36.937
You sure this is over?

31:39.315 --> 31:40.899
I'm sure.

31:41.108 --> 31:44.153
Why? Why do you ask?

31:45.446 --> 31:47.823
Never mind.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.034
It's nothing, I guess.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.869
(DOOR CLOSES)

31:52.661 --> 31:54.163
JENNY:
Hello?

31:54.371 --> 31:56.707
We're home.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.294
What happened?

32:00.502 --> 32:02.296
Hi. Sorry.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.257
We'll pay for all of this.

32:06.258 --> 32:10.679
Don't you worry.
Dean's gonna clean up this mess.

32:12.598 --> 32:16.268
Well, what are you waiting for, boy?
Get the mop.

32:16.352 --> 32:19.063
And don't cuss at me.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.293
Okay.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.912
(RATTLING)

33:19.164 --> 33:20.999
(SCREAMING)

33:34.179 --> 33:38.434
-So, what are we still doing here?
-I don't know. I just....

33:38.517 --> 33:42.062
-I still have a bad feeling.
-Why?

33:42.146 --> 33:45.524
Missouri did her Zelda Rubinstein thing.
This should be over.

33:45.733 --> 33:49.403
Yeah. Well, probably.
But I just wanna make sure, that's all.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.823
Well, problem is,
I could be sleeping in a bed right now.

33:57.411 --> 34:01.081
-(MOUTHS) Help.
-Dean. Dean!

34:01.999 --> 34:04.585
You grab the kids, I'll get Jenny.

34:13.427 --> 34:14.344
Come on.

34:22.436 --> 34:23.979
JENNY: Come on!
-Jenny!

34:24.188 --> 34:26.356
-I can't open the door!
-Stand back.

34:29.860 --> 34:31.278
-Come on.
-No, my kids!

34:31.487 --> 34:33.572
Sam's got your kids. Come on.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.450
SARI:
Help!

34:36.533 --> 34:38.577
Please.

34:41.497 --> 34:45.793
Come here. Come here.
Don't look. Don't look.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.767
Sari, take your brother outside
as fast as you can. Don't look back.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.394
(SCREAMS)

35:10.067 --> 35:12.486
-Are you okay, baby?
-Sari, where's Sam?

35:12.569 --> 35:15.572
He's inside.
Something has got him.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.413
Are you okay?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.872
Sam!

36:24.766 --> 36:26.143
Sam?

36:26.351 --> 36:27.853
Sam.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.567
-No! Don't! Don't!
-What? Why?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
Because I know who it is.

36:37.613 --> 36:38.822
I can see her now.

36:56.131 --> 36:57.799
Mom?

37:08.101 --> 37:09.394
Dean.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.662
Sam.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.294
I'm sorry.

37:39.216 --> 37:40.842
For what?

37:52.938 --> 37:56.149
You get out of my house.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.152
And let go of my son.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.962
Mom?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.351
Now it's over.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.574
Thanks for these.

38:46.283 --> 38:48.201
Don't thank me. They're yours.

38:53.123 --> 38:55.709
Well, there are no spirits
in there anymore.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.502
This time for sure.

38:59.087 --> 39:02.466
-Not even my mom?
-No.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.014
What happened?

39:09.514 --> 39:11.933
Your mom's spirit
and the poltergeist's energy...

39:12.142 --> 39:14.519
...they canceled each other out.

39:14.728 --> 39:18.148
Your mom destroyed herself
going after the thing.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.735
Why would she
do something like that?

39:22.944 --> 39:26.364
Well, to protect her boys, of course.

39:33.997 --> 39:36.416
Sam, I'm sorry.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.503
For what?

39:40.170 --> 39:42.631
You sensed it was here, didn't you?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.257
Even when I couldn't.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.264
What's happening to me?

39:52.307 --> 39:56.186
I know I should have
all the answers...

39:57.229 --> 39:58.396
...but I don't know.

39:59.356 --> 40:01.274
DEAN:
Sam, you ready?

40:05.612 --> 40:07.405
-Bye.
-Bye.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.952
Thanks, Sam.

40:15.539 --> 40:19.459
-Don't you boys be strangers.
-We won't.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.421
See you around.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.954
That boy.

40:56.997 --> 41:01.626
I mean, he has such powerful abilities.

41:04.629 --> 41:10.302
Why he couldn't sense his own father,
I have no idea.

41:14.973 --> 41:17.350
Mary's spirit?

41:17.851 --> 41:19.686
Do you really think
she saved the boys?

41:22.480 --> 41:24.482
I do.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.163
John Winchester,
I could just slap you.

41:38.371 --> 41:41.458
Why don't you go talk
to your children?

41:42.542 --> 41:44.002
I want to.

41:45.712 --> 41:48.548
You have no idea
how much I wanna see them.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.386
But I can't.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.097
Not yet.

42:01.144 --> 42:04.314
Not until I know the truth.
