WEBVTT

00:57.382 --> 00:59.618
Yeah, man, everything
is measured, cut, marked.

00:59.652 --> 01:01.754
Just needs to be mounted.

01:01.788 --> 01:03.488
Right, you can
take it from here?

01:04.824 --> 01:06.391
You're hopeless, man.

01:06.425 --> 01:08.226
No, no, it's cool, I got it.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.662
I will just come back
after the trip

01:09.696 --> 01:11.396
and take care of it,
finish it up.

01:11.430 --> 01:12.932
Yeah.

01:12.965 --> 01:15.233
No, no, no, we know about you
and power tools, bud.

01:17.335 --> 01:19.404
No, I got it.

01:19.438 --> 01:21.708
Jeez. Yeah, I know.

01:21.741 --> 01:23.442
Sure.

01:23.475 --> 01:26.779
Right. Oh my God, man.

01:26.813 --> 01:29.548
So, did you use this thing
to cut a cake

01:29.581 --> 01:32.317
or to skin a bear?

01:32.350 --> 01:33.820
This big-ass knife
you got in this box

01:33.853 --> 01:36.621
marked "wedding stuff."

01:36.656 --> 01:37.957
Really?

01:37.990 --> 01:39.992
I don't remember it
being this big.

01:40.026 --> 01:41.359
I was really drunk, though.

01:43.462 --> 01:46.999
Right, yeah, I set myself up
for that one.

01:47.033 --> 01:48.433
Okay.

01:49.769 --> 01:50.770
Yeah, no, I got it.

01:50.803 --> 01:51.637
I'm just gonna lock up.

01:51.671 --> 01:52.939
I'm gonna drink
some of your beer,

01:52.972 --> 01:54.272
eat some of your food,

01:54.306 --> 01:57.009
that way I can avoid
Misha's cooking.

01:57.043 --> 01:59.578
Yeah, it's that bad.

01:59.611 --> 02:01.781
Right. Yeah, okay,
well, hurry your ass up.

02:01.814 --> 02:02.782
Let's get on the road.

03:53.425 --> 03:54.827
Fucking kidding me!

04:15.447 --> 04:16.716
What was that?

04:21.821 --> 04:25.490
Jim and Neil's dog came over
to our property again.

04:25.523 --> 04:28.160
Oreo? He's harmless.

04:28.194 --> 04:29.629
Yeah, well, he comes over
to the yard

04:29.662 --> 04:31.097
and he pisses
all over my stuff.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.866
I had a million-dollar job
on Avolencia last week

04:33.900 --> 04:36.769
and all my gear
smelled like dog piss.

04:36.802 --> 04:37.870
I told Jim if he did it again,

04:37.904 --> 04:39.604
I was gonna toss him back over.

04:39.639 --> 04:42.108
Don't tell me that you threw
Oreo over the fence.

04:42.141 --> 04:44.644
I didn't throw him
over the fence, jeez.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.779
I picked him up,
I set him down

04:46.812 --> 04:48.781
over the shortest portion
of the fence.

04:48.814 --> 04:50.950
He squirmed out of my arms
at the last minute.

04:50.983 --> 04:52.584
Threw him over the fence?

04:52.617 --> 04:54.220
Jesus Christ.

04:54.253 --> 04:56.488
You love to blow shit out
of proportion, you know that?

04:56.521 --> 04:57.990
If that was
your precious garden, though,

04:58.024 --> 04:59.225
- oh, man...
- You know what?

04:59.258 --> 05:00.760
Let's not do this right now.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.194
They're gonna be here
any minute.

05:02.228 --> 05:04.063
Fine.

05:17.677 --> 05:19.645
Have you been reading these?

05:21.213 --> 05:23.683
Yeah.

05:23.716 --> 05:26.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:27.653 --> 05:29.021
Wow.

05:34.727 --> 05:36.796
I'm sorry.

05:36.829 --> 05:39.497
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to barge in here like this

05:39.531 --> 05:41.100
and acting all crazy.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.836
I just...

05:43.869 --> 05:45.805
I mean, this is amazing.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.710
Look, I promise you,
I'm gonna make the best father.

05:50.743 --> 05:52.845
And this kid,
he's gonna be an all-American

05:52.878 --> 05:54.113
by his freshman year
of college.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.815
Or she, she will be
an all-American.

05:55.848 --> 05:57.883
No, I don't know.

05:59.051 --> 06:00.219
What don't you know?

06:00.252 --> 06:02.989
This could be a game changer
for us.

06:03.022 --> 06:06.792
Hayden, a baby
doesn't fix a marriage.

06:06.826 --> 06:09.095
A baby isn't magic.

06:09.128 --> 06:12.564
Sometimes it makes things worse.

06:14.233 --> 06:17.636
Let's just talk about this
when we get back,

06:17.670 --> 06:19.939
and we need to get ready.

06:19.972 --> 06:22.708
They're gonna be here
any minute, come on.

06:22.742 --> 06:24.977
We have to go.

08:19.692 --> 08:21.026
I got it, I got it.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.770
You guys should take in
this fresh air.

08:41.947 --> 08:43.115
I'm comin'. Comin'.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.313
Yeah, man, not bad.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.314
Not bad.

09:17.249 --> 09:19.752
I'm so relieved, it's...

09:19.785 --> 09:21.754
It's pretty good.

09:21.787 --> 09:23.389
You doubted me?

09:23.422 --> 09:24.490
You don't think
I can put together

09:24.523 --> 09:25.958
a kick-ass weekend?

09:25.991 --> 09:28.027
Well, now that
we're rewriting history,

09:28.060 --> 09:30.329
we'll just forget that vacation
from two years ago.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.064
Yeah, let's definitely
forget about that one.

09:32.097 --> 09:35.000
Wait, I didn't hear
any of you guys complaining

09:35.034 --> 09:37.036
when you all got
a full refund, so...

09:37.069 --> 09:40.206
Well, it really is beautiful
out here.

09:40.239 --> 09:43.008
- It actually is.
- Yeah, it is.

09:43.042 --> 09:44.944
It's quiet.

09:47.279 --> 09:48.747
All right,
so is there a bellhop

09:48.781 --> 09:50.015
or we got to get
these bags ourselves?

09:50.049 --> 09:51.317
Oh my God.

09:51.350 --> 09:52.985
- What?
- Look.

09:53.018 --> 09:54.753
Oh my God, you guys,
he's not moving.

09:54.787 --> 09:55.888
Who's not... what?

09:55.921 --> 09:58.290
- Hold on.
- Stay here.

09:58.324 --> 09:59.825
What?

10:06.865 --> 10:09.068
Hey, man, you okay?

10:15.307 --> 10:16.775
I don't think
he's breathing, man.

10:27.319 --> 10:29.121
Oh! Ah!

10:29.154 --> 10:30.456
Oh, Jesus!

10:37.029 --> 10:39.865
That's the point, though,
you never know.

10:39.898 --> 10:42.835
Never know what?

10:42.868 --> 10:45.971
Never know when the element
of surprise might, uh,

10:46.005 --> 10:47.439
surprise ya.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.910
Is everything okay?

10:55.180 --> 10:57.816
Ooh, son.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.151
One of you guys dealing drugs

10:59.184 --> 11:02.321
or a hip-hop guy or something?

11:02.354 --> 11:04.189
Yeah, I like me
a practical ride,

11:04.223 --> 11:07.593
but that's a gas guzzler
right there.

11:07.627 --> 11:09.895
Whatever tickles your pickle,
though, am I right?

11:12.464 --> 11:15.334
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

11:18.003 --> 11:19.938
Bo-Lee.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.408
I live down on the property.

11:22.441 --> 11:24.576
I'll be your concierge
for the weekend.

11:25.978 --> 11:29.148
I'm Misha, and this is Nora.

11:29.181 --> 11:30.983
Ah, pleasure.

11:31.016 --> 11:32.885
Bo-Lee.

11:32.918 --> 11:34.019
I like that.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.622
Yep, Bo hyphen Lee.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.957
It's a family name.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.293
Bo, Hayden.

11:41.327 --> 11:42.361
I'm the one
who booked the place.

11:42.394 --> 11:44.563
Yeah, it's Bo-Lee.

11:46.065 --> 11:47.599
That's my buddy, Chris.

11:47.634 --> 11:50.536
And it looks like
you already met the wives.

11:50.569 --> 11:52.938
Mm-hm.

11:52.971 --> 11:54.173
You boys are gonna
have yourselves

11:54.206 --> 11:57.509
a damn fine time
this weekend, huh?

12:03.282 --> 12:04.550
Okay.

12:04.583 --> 12:08.454
As the song goes,
follow the leader.

12:11.957 --> 12:13.660
You know, say, man,

12:13.693 --> 12:15.027
seeing you
on the ground like that,

12:15.060 --> 12:16.228
we thought you were dead.

12:16.261 --> 12:18.297
Maybe I was.

12:18.330 --> 12:20.065
Nah, helps my spine.

12:20.099 --> 12:21.600
Old back injury.

12:24.403 --> 12:26.972
Yeah, my chiropractor
says the same thing.

12:27.005 --> 12:29.007
Lay on the lumpy ground
with some gravel.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.275
It does wonders for your back.

12:32.311 --> 12:34.980
Watch your step.

12:44.423 --> 12:46.558
You coming, Nora?

12:48.661 --> 12:50.562
Great job.

12:50.596 --> 12:51.930
Thank you.

13:12.518 --> 13:14.119
All right.

13:14.153 --> 13:16.155
So we got, uh,
we got an L shape.

13:16.188 --> 13:18.624
There's a bedroom
down that way.

13:18.658 --> 13:20.426
There's two more down there.

13:20.459 --> 13:21.694
Each got their own bathroom,

13:21.728 --> 13:25.397
you know, a commode
and everything.

13:25.431 --> 13:27.634
Given there's two pair of ya,
it might be a good idea

13:27.667 --> 13:30.269
to sleep on opposite ends
of the house anyway,

13:30.302 --> 13:32.304
know what I mean?

13:34.440 --> 13:36.575
That's the living room
over there.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.977
Fireplace, feel free to use.

13:39.011 --> 13:40.713
Woo!

13:40.747 --> 13:42.682
Uh, kitchen, got a kitchen,

13:42.715 --> 13:46.218
uh, table, chairs.

13:46.251 --> 13:47.419
Go out this door here,

13:47.453 --> 13:50.122
there's like a courtyard
and whatnot.

13:50.155 --> 13:53.660
You got lots of land here,
a barn, stables down there.

13:53.693 --> 13:55.461
You got the run
of the property,

13:55.494 --> 13:57.362
you know, except, uh,
except those trailers.

13:57.396 --> 13:59.331
That's where I stay.

13:59.364 --> 14:02.735
Mm. People always ask, uh,

14:02.769 --> 14:06.104
they're asking about internet
and cable TV.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.072
No, sir.

14:07.105 --> 14:10.008
I got some DVDs you can borrow
if you like.

14:10.042 --> 14:10.910
If you need to get on the web,

14:10.944 --> 14:14.012
there's a coffee place
down in town,

14:14.046 --> 14:15.514
and there's a bar
across from the Payless.

14:15.547 --> 14:17.282
I go down there to watch
the kung fu fights.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.084
They got good cable.

14:22.054 --> 14:24.423
No, we're just here to unplug
for the weekend anyway.

14:24.456 --> 14:26.759
And I'm sure my wife,
for one weekend,

14:26.793 --> 14:28.795
can be off of Facebook.

14:28.828 --> 14:33.332
No one is on Facebook
under the age of 60, dear,

14:33.365 --> 14:36.335
but I will need
to get on Insta.

14:36.368 --> 14:40.572
Is that the site where dudes
go to find other dudes?

14:40.606 --> 14:42.474
No! No.

14:42.508 --> 14:44.243
It's Instagram.

14:44.276 --> 14:47.246
Maybe you and me, we can hike
into town this weekend.

14:47.279 --> 14:49.281
We can, you know,
find some shops

14:49.314 --> 14:51.784
and find a little Wi-Fi.

14:51.818 --> 14:54.052
- Yeah.
- Gee, I don't know.

14:54.086 --> 14:57.489
That's a hell of a walk,
like 12 miles.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.125
I can see you ladies
like to get sweaty.

15:02.762 --> 15:04.563
Okay.

15:04.596 --> 15:07.299
Uh, got some keys here for ya.

15:07.332 --> 15:09.301
I'll leave these here.

15:09.334 --> 15:12.137
Can't figure something out,
just give me a holler, knock,

15:12.170 --> 15:14.206
come on in, I don't care.

15:14.239 --> 15:18.443
I like to walk around
all-natural.

15:18.477 --> 15:21.113
That means no clothes on.

15:22.682 --> 15:25.384
- That was a joke.
- Okay.

15:25.417 --> 15:28.220
Or was it?

15:28.253 --> 15:30.088
Clean up after yourself.

15:31.423 --> 15:33.693
The good Lord hates a slob.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.298
Good Lord hates a slob.

15:43.302 --> 15:45.370
Oh my God.

15:45.404 --> 15:47.406
Okay, seriously,
where did you find this guy?

15:47.439 --> 15:48.875
I guess that's why
I got such a good deal

15:48.908 --> 15:50.075
- on this place.
- Yeah, no kidding.

15:50.108 --> 15:52.277
I knew we shouldn't have
left it up to your cheap ass.

15:52.311 --> 15:53.746
Oh, no, Chris, he's not cheap.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.314
Don't you remember?

15:55.347 --> 15:57.850
He got the plastic
champagne flutes,

15:57.884 --> 15:59.786
not the Styrofoam last time.

16:05.157 --> 16:06.458
I remember that.

16:06.491 --> 16:07.627
All right.

16:07.660 --> 16:10.562
Well, I'm gonna go unpack.

16:10.596 --> 16:13.498
Hey, guys, let's all freshen up
and meet back here,

16:13.532 --> 16:16.535
and I will make us
some sangria.

16:16.568 --> 16:19.137
- Ooh!
- By sangria,

16:19.171 --> 16:21.373
she means sangrias, plural.

16:21.406 --> 16:24.610
- Nice! Nice!
- Ooh, Lordy.

16:24.644 --> 16:25.745
All right.

16:25.778 --> 16:28.180
Let's do it.

16:31.784 --> 16:34.821
This place isn't so bad, right?

16:34.854 --> 16:36.521
Bo-Lee is a lunatic.

16:36.555 --> 16:39.424
I'm sure you two
will become fast friends.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.395
Is that a shot at me or at him?

16:43.428 --> 16:45.698
Oh my God.

16:45.732 --> 16:48.600
I'm kidding, relax.

16:50.903 --> 16:55.207
Well, he certainly was into you
and that outfit.

16:58.276 --> 17:00.579
Let's just make the best
of this weekend.

17:01.814 --> 17:04.249
Okay.

17:04.282 --> 17:07.152
Let's just make the best
of this weekend.

17:13.291 --> 17:16.328
Babe, you never know
when Bo-Lee Norman Bates

17:16.361 --> 17:17.396
might be lurking.

17:19.598 --> 17:20.833
I know.

17:20.867 --> 17:21.834
You know how those guys are,
I mean,

17:21.868 --> 17:24.536
they've been out here
their entire lives.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.204
Just ain't as woke
as us city folk.

17:26.238 --> 17:27.840
Mm.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.842
He didn't give you the creeps?

17:29.876 --> 17:32.645
Eh, he's harmless.

17:32.679 --> 17:35.547
Bit of a weirdo, but harmless.

17:35.580 --> 17:38.216
Mm.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.721
If he oversteps this weekend,
I'll be sure to say something.

17:41.754 --> 17:43.823
Oh, I'll be fine.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.223
I can handle myself.

17:45.257 --> 17:46.491
Trust me, I know you can.

17:46.525 --> 17:49.796
My badass
and hard-working wife.

17:49.829 --> 17:53.598
- Mm.
- I'm gonna get changed.

17:53.633 --> 17:58.370
Okay. I just need to compose
a few e-mails before Monday.

18:01.974 --> 18:04.944
It's supposed to be
a work-free weekend, remember?

18:04.977 --> 18:06.813
I know.

18:06.846 --> 18:08.580
It'll just take a sec.

18:08.613 --> 18:10.850
And it's hardly work anyway.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.284
Well, good luck anyhow.

18:12.317 --> 18:13.585
There's no Wi-Fi here, remember?

18:13.618 --> 18:15.520
I just need to compose them
while they're still in my head

18:15.554 --> 18:18.590
and I'll send them Sunday night
when we get in.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.894
God.

18:26.666 --> 18:27.633
And then this motherfucker says,

18:27.667 --> 18:30.636
"I don't need to see your ID,
just hers."

18:30.670 --> 18:31.838
I'm like, "Fuck you, man!

18:31.871 --> 18:33.405
I don't look that old, do I?"

18:33.438 --> 18:34.372
- Come on.
- And then you looked

18:34.406 --> 18:35.808
in the mirror?

18:35.842 --> 18:37.476
Look at Nora bringing the heat.

18:37.509 --> 18:39.277
Look at your girl, huh?

18:39.311 --> 18:40.278
I'm telling you, man,
this is why I could

18:40.312 --> 18:41.346
never win a fight with her

18:41.379 --> 18:43.415
because she's too quick for me.

18:43.448 --> 18:45.517
- Too quick.
- Well, I mean, come on.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.420
You do, you look young
for your age, he does,

18:48.453 --> 18:50.355
but you don't look under 21.

18:50.388 --> 18:52.024
Well, shit, neither do you.

18:52.058 --> 18:54.559
- Ooh!
- Oh, no, you didn't.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.361
No, you didn't.

18:56.394 --> 18:58.664
Do you see this?
Do you see this?

18:58.698 --> 19:01.067
Do you see the shit
that I put up with?

19:01.100 --> 19:02.735
- All the time.
- Oh, well, please.

19:02.769 --> 19:04.603
You don't look under 21.

19:04.637 --> 19:07.472
- I mean, come on.
- No, first of all,

19:07.506 --> 19:10.643
you... Misha looks like
she could pass for 21,

19:10.676 --> 19:11.677
and second of all,
you don't say

19:11.711 --> 19:12.745
that kind of thing to a woman.

19:12.779 --> 19:14.412
- Mm-hm.
- What is wrong with you?

19:14.446 --> 19:16.783
Really?
Chris, help me out, man.

19:16.816 --> 19:18.718
She does not look under 21.

19:18.751 --> 19:20.452
- Yeah, Chris.
- Chris, what do you think?

19:20.485 --> 19:21.687
Yes, Chris, what do you think?

19:21.721 --> 19:23.522
Um, what was the question?

19:23.555 --> 19:24.891
No, I, uh...

19:24.924 --> 19:28.360
Look, I... I know
that she's not 19,

19:28.393 --> 19:30.663
so, uh, I can't,
uh, really say.

19:30.696 --> 19:31.898
But it's simple.

19:31.931 --> 19:33.099
The question is,
does Misha look

19:33.132 --> 19:36.601
like she could pass for 21
or no?

19:36.636 --> 19:39.939
- And the answer is yes.
- Yeah, he's thinking.

19:39.972 --> 19:42.574
We've got company.

19:51.150 --> 19:53.886
Ahh.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.722
Suppertime, suppertime.

19:58.791 --> 20:01.127
Sorry to barge in.

20:01.160 --> 20:04.897
Got a bulb blew
down there at the barn.

20:04.931 --> 20:06.899
Owner keeps them up here
in the washer/dryer room

20:06.933 --> 20:08.600
in y'all's place,
so here I am.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.138
Do your thing, man.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.639
It's your place.

20:13.673 --> 20:15.107
Oh, no, no.

20:15.141 --> 20:17.977
No, I run things here,
but, you know,

20:18.010 --> 20:19.879
this weekend it's y'all's home.

20:19.912 --> 20:21.747
Carry on.

20:31.523 --> 20:34.126
Okay, that spitting
in that bottle?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.895
- That's nasty.
- It is.

20:35.928 --> 20:39.031
- That is nasty.
- Oh, yeah.

20:39.065 --> 20:40.032
We know lots of guys
that do that.

20:40.066 --> 20:43.002
- I played baseball...
- What are we, in 1940?

20:43.035 --> 20:45.403
Oh, shit. Brad,
one of my best friends,

20:45.437 --> 20:47.840
he still does it,
he sells real estate.

20:47.874 --> 20:49.441
Drives around,
shows clients properties.

20:49.474 --> 20:50.843
He's still spitting in it,
keeps it

20:50.877 --> 20:52.712
in the center console
of his Mercedes-Benz.

20:52.745 --> 20:54.512
- He does not.
- Yes, he does.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.614
It's true.

20:55.648 --> 20:58.985
I met Brad and he's charming.

20:59.018 --> 21:01.553
He's nothing like
Bo fucking hyphen Lee.

21:03.521 --> 21:05.057
Yeah, please, poor Brad.

21:05.091 --> 21:07.827
He's not here
to defend himself.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.829
Oh.

21:11.197 --> 21:14.133
Well, I'm all set.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.869
- What's in the bag?
- That's a lot of bulbs

21:16.903 --> 21:19.537
you got there, Bo-Lee, jeez.

21:22.241 --> 21:24.210
Bo-Lee, I gotta... I'm sorry,
I got to ask you

21:24.243 --> 21:27.479
a serious, serious question.

21:27.512 --> 21:30.016
Would you ever consider
selling real estate?

21:33.853 --> 21:36.588
Oh my God.

21:36.621 --> 21:38.858
What's so fucking funny?

21:38.891 --> 21:40.492
Nothing, man,
it's just... I'm sorry.

21:40.525 --> 21:43.495
It's just... it's an inside joke

21:43.528 --> 21:44.697
about a guy we know
is all, yeah.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.732
Yeah, we're just joking.

21:46.766 --> 21:49.969
- Tell me.
- Sorry?

21:50.002 --> 21:52.872
Tell me this joke.

21:52.905 --> 21:57.542
No, really, it's... it's a long,
boring story.

21:57.575 --> 21:59.245
Stupid, really, it's dumb.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.880
- It was a joke.
- Being silly.

22:00.913 --> 22:03.515
Having a little too much fun
is all.

22:04.817 --> 22:07.086
Either you tell me the story

22:07.119 --> 22:09.621
or all y'all are out.

22:09.655 --> 22:12.992
- Hey, come on.
- Tell me the story

22:13.025 --> 22:15.861
or I'm gonna go get my gun

22:15.895 --> 22:17.630
and I'm gonna make you
tell me the story.

22:17.663 --> 22:20.498
Okay, okay, let's, uh...

22:22.201 --> 22:24.737
Be cool, okay?

22:26.872 --> 22:28.774
I'll tell you the story.

22:30.810 --> 22:33.079
Look at this fucker here!

22:33.112 --> 22:34.647
Look at this fucker!

22:34.680 --> 22:36.916
"Oh, oh.

22:36.949 --> 22:40.019
Oh, now, fella, let's be cool.

22:40.052 --> 22:43.588
I'm the sheriff
around these parts."

22:43.621 --> 22:44.991
And all y'all's faces.

22:45.024 --> 22:46.258
Y'all's faces.

22:50.629 --> 22:53.232
Okay, we like joking here,
but when you threaten people

22:53.265 --> 22:55.134
with a gun,
what the fuck is that?

22:55.167 --> 22:58.137
- That's not cool.
- Well, he doesn't have a gun.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.571
- How do you know?
- Right?

23:01.707 --> 23:04.677
Is that... is that Italian?

23:04.710 --> 23:08.848
I put you folks on tacos or...

23:08.881 --> 23:11.717
fried chicken.

23:11.751 --> 23:14.987
Anyhoo, I'll get out
of your short and curlies.

23:18.623 --> 23:20.092
Adios.

23:24.964 --> 23:26.966
Okay, what I want to know

23:26.999 --> 23:28.901
is who was that fried chicken
comment directed towards?

23:28.934 --> 23:29.735
Was that... was that for me?

23:29.769 --> 23:31.237
Oh, he didn't mean it
like that.

23:31.270 --> 23:33.039
He's just joking around.

23:33.072 --> 23:35.241
Yeah, well,
he needs to learn some tact.

23:35.274 --> 23:36.976
- Tact? For that guy?
- Fried chicken, really?

23:37.009 --> 23:40.146
Seriously, that's a tall order.

23:40.179 --> 23:42.681
- Oh my God.
- Hey, hey, I don't think

23:42.715 --> 23:44.350
that he meant it that way.

23:44.383 --> 23:47.053
Here's the thing,
I need to know

23:47.086 --> 23:49.321
who is the Mexican
in this scenario

23:49.355 --> 23:52.058
because I think
he's talking about me.

23:52.091 --> 23:53.726
Is it me?

23:53.759 --> 23:54.894
There's the better question.

23:54.927 --> 23:56.362
Okay.

23:56.395 --> 23:58.097
Taco guy?

23:58.130 --> 24:00.099
I'm taco man.

24:00.132 --> 24:02.268
Whoo!

24:02.301 --> 24:04.804
Guys, are we going hiking
in the morning?

24:04.837 --> 24:06.906
- I got to call it a night.
- Yes.

24:06.939 --> 24:08.040
I'm not a morning person.

24:08.074 --> 24:10.142
Yeah, exactly, you're not.

24:10.176 --> 24:11.644
I mean none of us are, right?

24:11.677 --> 24:14.780
And the gallons of sangria?
Come on.

24:14.814 --> 24:16.715
I'm calling it, I'm calling it.

24:16.749 --> 24:18.050
No, no, I'll get these.

24:18.084 --> 24:19.351
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:19.385 --> 24:20.986
Yes, it's just
a couple of plates.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.988
It's just a couple of plates,
go to sleep.

24:23.022 --> 24:25.124
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm positive.

24:25.157 --> 24:27.359
- Okay.
- Yeah.

24:27.393 --> 24:30.663
- All right, buddy.
- Nora, you coming with?

24:30.696 --> 24:32.231
Yes.

24:32.264 --> 24:34.266
- Thank you all for dinner.
- You're welcome.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.303
Your famous pasta
was delicious.

24:37.336 --> 24:38.938
And I'll see you
in the morning?

24:38.971 --> 24:40.239
See you in the morning.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.308
Although, reluctantly
for some people.

24:42.341 --> 24:45.077
- Goodnight.
- Well...

24:48.080 --> 24:50.249
What?

24:50.282 --> 24:51.750
Well, aren't you a sweetheart?

24:54.153 --> 24:56.222
Are you gonna help me?

24:56.255 --> 24:58.757
No, it's just
a couple of plates.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.159
You've got this.

25:00.192 --> 25:01.327
Jesus Christ.

25:08.701 --> 25:10.302
I think I drank too much.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.640
Hayden always makes you do that.

25:16.342 --> 25:19.145
I'm gonna shower.

25:19.178 --> 25:21.747
I'm gonna close my eyes
a second.

25:41.967 --> 25:44.803
Oh, Christ.

25:51.410 --> 25:54.213
The kitchen is clean.

25:55.281 --> 25:57.116
Great.

25:57.149 --> 25:59.985
Oh my God.

26:00.019 --> 26:02.188
This is so you, you know?

26:02.221 --> 26:04.924
"Let's have a nice weekend,
honey."

26:04.957 --> 26:07.126
And then you do a complete 180.

26:13.098 --> 26:16.068
I'm going to bed.

26:16.101 --> 26:17.269
Clean up after yourself.

26:19.271 --> 26:21.240
Fucking bitch ass.

27:00.012 --> 27:01.480
Were you trying
to fuck with me?

27:05.417 --> 27:08.254
The bathroom window just now,
were you trying to scare me?

27:10.155 --> 27:11.857
What are you talking about?

27:11.890 --> 27:14.260
I've been right here.

27:14.293 --> 27:15.294
It's cold as hell out there.

27:15.327 --> 27:17.229
Why would I go outside?

27:21.533 --> 27:24.270
You think it was Hayden?

27:24.303 --> 27:26.572
Mm-mm.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.173
He wouldn't mess with you
in the shower.

27:28.207 --> 27:31.076
That's crossing the line
even for him.

27:31.110 --> 27:33.879
Well, something was.

27:33.912 --> 27:35.914
I bet it was
that fucking Bo-Lee guy.

27:35.948 --> 27:37.216
Mm.

27:46.158 --> 27:48.027
There's nothing out there.

27:52.231 --> 27:55.401
It was probably just the wind.

27:55.434 --> 27:57.369
No, I already looked.

27:57.403 --> 27:59.004
It just felt like
something was watching me,

27:59.038 --> 28:02.141
and then I heard a noise twice.

28:02.174 --> 28:04.176
I'm positive
it was not the wind.

28:04.209 --> 28:07.112
You felt like you saw someone

28:07.146 --> 28:09.848
and then you felt
like you heard a noise?

28:09.882 --> 28:11.583
No, I didn't feel
like I heard something.

28:11.617 --> 28:14.119
I heard something.

28:14.153 --> 28:15.821
Don't do that.

28:21.460 --> 28:23.195
Okay.

28:31.203 --> 28:32.137
I'll go look.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.942
Really?

28:36.975 --> 28:39.078
You're quitting?

28:39.111 --> 28:40.579
It's vacation.

29:44.644 --> 29:46.145
Jesus fucking Christ.

29:46.178 --> 29:48.046
So jumpy, handsome.

29:48.080 --> 29:49.148
Sorry, you scared
the shit out of me.

29:49.181 --> 29:52.217
You trying to start
the next epic brush fire here?

29:52.251 --> 29:53.986
Yeah, you're not kidding.

29:56.054 --> 29:58.023
What are you doing out here?

29:58.056 --> 29:58.991
Well, I was heading to bed,

29:59.024 --> 30:01.260
and then I saw you over here
puffing away.

30:01.293 --> 30:02.995
I thought you quit
those things, by the way.

30:03.028 --> 30:04.596
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nora is gonna kill you.

30:04.631 --> 30:07.199
Shh. Nah, she already knows.

30:07.232 --> 30:09.535
I think she wants
to kill me anyhow.

30:09.568 --> 30:11.069
Oh, and what the hell
is up with you

30:11.103 --> 30:12.438
going to bed so early,

30:12.471 --> 30:14.072
leaving me all alone in there
with Misha?

30:17.142 --> 30:19.244
Just tired is all.

30:19.278 --> 30:21.613
I'll be more fun tomorrow.

30:21.648 --> 30:24.616
Not too tired to come out here
and steal a smoke.

30:24.651 --> 30:26.585
No, man, she, you know,
she thought she saw someone

30:26.618 --> 30:30.122
outside our bathroom window,
so I...

30:30.155 --> 30:32.759
told her I'd come out here
and check on it.

30:32.792 --> 30:34.694
Two birds, one stone.

30:34.727 --> 30:35.829
Yeah.

30:35.862 --> 30:38.597
Well, shit, hey, give me
one of those cowboy killers.

30:40.165 --> 30:42.234
Thank you, sir.

30:53.479 --> 30:56.315
Someone outside
your window, huh?

30:58.250 --> 31:00.085
I don't know, man.
You know Nora.

31:00.118 --> 31:01.721
She always gets so jumpy
and paranoid

31:01.754 --> 31:06.325
when she's not surrounded
by asphalt and...

31:06.358 --> 31:07.760
stoplights.

31:07.794 --> 31:12.264
Starts running
Texas Chainsaw scenarios

31:12.297 --> 31:14.199
through her head.

31:14.233 --> 31:17.469
Plus, that Bo-Lee guy, man,
kind of freaked her out.

31:17.503 --> 31:20.606
Yeah, well, our boy, Bo,
I don't think he's got

31:20.640 --> 31:23.442
too much practice
interacting with people.

31:23.475 --> 31:25.344
That's what I told her.

31:25.377 --> 31:28.480
"It's Bo-Lee, by the way."

31:35.320 --> 31:36.154
What's going on
with you and Misha?

31:36.188 --> 31:39.224
You guys all right?

31:39.258 --> 31:41.326
Mm.

31:41.360 --> 31:43.796
What makes you ask that?

31:43.830 --> 31:46.331
Nothing, you just said
that I left you alone with her

31:46.365 --> 31:48.033
tonight is all.

31:49.869 --> 31:53.305
We're going through
a little bit of a rough patch.

31:53.338 --> 31:55.374
Really?

31:57.242 --> 31:58.377
Everything all right?

31:58.410 --> 32:00.345
Oh, you know, the normal stuff.

32:00.379 --> 32:03.850
Work, money, communication.

32:03.883 --> 32:05.818
I can't stand
that fucking bitch anymore,

32:05.852 --> 32:07.286
so there's that.

32:07.319 --> 32:10.622
- Come on.
- I don't know.

32:10.657 --> 32:13.392
Just got to work through
a couple things, that's all.

32:16.528 --> 32:18.831
Anything you want
to talk about?

32:19.866 --> 32:22.434
Nah.

32:22.467 --> 32:26.371
You know, I've got a feeling

32:26.405 --> 32:28.574
that this trip is gonna be
real good for us.

32:28.607 --> 32:32.210
We're gonna get
some things resolved.

32:32.244 --> 32:35.547
Start out with a clean slate.

32:35.581 --> 32:36.683
What about you
and your girl, man?

32:36.716 --> 32:41.420
Aside from the occasional
peeping Tom or Sasquatch,

32:41.453 --> 32:42.689
whatever the fuck it is
you guys think

32:42.722 --> 32:44.222
you saw out here.

32:44.256 --> 32:46.759
- We're good.
- Yeah, well...

32:48.795 --> 32:50.830
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

32:52.732 --> 32:53.733
Well...

32:55.300 --> 32:58.337
Man, I hope you and Misha
are all right.

32:58.370 --> 33:00.205
Yeah, thanks, man.

33:01.406 --> 33:03.275
All right.

33:04.409 --> 33:05.577
I'm going to bed.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.279
See you in the morning?

33:07.312 --> 33:09.481
Yeah.

33:09.514 --> 33:11.684
- See you in the morning.
- See you in the morning

33:11.718 --> 33:12.919
bright and early.

33:12.952 --> 33:14.553
Yeah.

35:07.033 --> 35:10.335
Oh, you're in a big hurry
to get your ass kicked.

35:10.368 --> 35:11.771
You know we're racing
to the top of that mountain

35:11.804 --> 35:13.005
we saw on the way in,

35:13.039 --> 35:14.774
and I'm feeling
real good today.

35:14.807 --> 35:17.509
What? All right,
you're talking shit already?

35:17.542 --> 35:19.779
Okay, well, it's on then,
let's do this.

35:19.812 --> 35:21.580
Oh, yeah, I don't know
about that, man.

35:21.613 --> 35:23.381
You guys had
that surfing competition,

35:23.415 --> 35:25.718
she caught, like, twice
as many waves as you did.

35:25.752 --> 35:26.986
Then she beat your ass
at arm wrestling.

35:27.019 --> 35:30.288
Okay, all right, that's good,
don't encourage her, man.

35:30.322 --> 35:32.024
What about you?
You getting in on this?

35:32.058 --> 35:34.392
'Cause I would love
to take your big ass down.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.661
Guys, are we on vacation,

35:35.695 --> 35:36.763
or are we doing a Spartan Race?

35:36.796 --> 35:39.665
No! Gonna let you two
competitive freaks go at it.

35:39.699 --> 35:41.500
I'm gonna stay back and watch.

35:41.533 --> 35:44.637
And speaking of freaks.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.873
Are you still drunk
from last night?

35:46.906 --> 35:48.507
Okay.

35:48.540 --> 35:49.976
Let's do this.

35:50.009 --> 35:51.443
Yeah, let's do it.

35:51.476 --> 35:53.780
You look fine, come on.

35:53.813 --> 35:55.347
Don't let him stress you out.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.884
Maybe lighten up on her
a little bit.

35:57.917 --> 35:59.886
This is what we do, man,
she kind of digs it.

35:59.919 --> 36:03.890
This is, uh, our weird way
of working things out.

36:03.923 --> 36:05.658
That's a very weird way
of working things out.

36:05.691 --> 36:08.027
Maybe you are still
a little drunk.

36:08.060 --> 36:10.495
Maybe.

36:10.529 --> 36:12.098
Hey, is that a beer?

36:12.131 --> 36:13.565
Come on, man, share.

36:15.467 --> 36:16.769
Hey, ladies.

36:23.142 --> 36:25.912
Y'all going to a party?

36:25.945 --> 36:28.881
No, just a hike.

36:28.915 --> 36:32.350
She looks like
she's going to a party.

36:32.384 --> 36:33.920
No.

36:33.953 --> 36:35.587
Just a hike.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.023
Promise.

36:37.056 --> 36:40.693
Didn't get my invite
to the party.

36:42.161 --> 36:43.996
Okay.

36:44.030 --> 36:46.398
Let's, um, let's wait
for the boys.

36:46.431 --> 36:47.834
I don't like the feel
of this guy.

36:50.002 --> 36:53.639
Just tying her shoe.

36:53.673 --> 36:55.440
That's why Velcro
is the way to go...

36:56.776 --> 36:58.044
...if you can afford it.

36:58.077 --> 37:00.713
I guess.

37:00.746 --> 37:03.381
I just don't think
he's seen many women like me

37:03.415 --> 37:05.483
around here.

37:05.517 --> 37:07.119
Seriously, oh my God.

37:07.153 --> 37:09.755
- Where are they?
- Ugh.

37:09.789 --> 37:11.623
Shit.

37:19.564 --> 37:20.933
Wearing down already, Nora?

37:20.967 --> 37:22.768
- What's up?
- No, we're waiting on you guys.

37:22.802 --> 37:25.738
So, don't look now,
but the psycho Bo-Lee killer

37:25.771 --> 37:27.773
is over there in the woods
watching us.

37:27.807 --> 37:30.176
Yes, he was just talking to us.

37:30.209 --> 37:30.943
- Where?
- I don't see him.

37:30.977 --> 37:33.813
- I said, "Don't look."
- What?

37:33.846 --> 37:35.614
Oh, sh...

37:35.648 --> 37:37.750
Seriously, he was just there.

37:37.783 --> 37:39.685
He was just talking to us.

37:39.719 --> 37:41.187
He was eyeing me up and down.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.455
Yeah, he was over there
like 20 seconds ago.

37:43.488 --> 37:45.024
- He was digging.
- Yeah.

37:45.057 --> 37:46.792
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

37:46.826 --> 37:49.427
Yes, he was right there.

37:49.461 --> 37:50.830
Okay, I'm creeped out.

37:50.863 --> 37:52.597
Oh my God.

37:52.632 --> 37:54.734
- Where'd he go?
- He's not there anymore.

37:54.767 --> 37:56.969
Come on, let's get
this train going.

37:57.003 --> 37:59.705
No, but he just disappeared,
I don't...

38:00.940 --> 38:05.645
♪ Bo-Lee, the vanishing hick ♪

38:05.678 --> 38:09.715
Oh, it looks a lot more steep
up-close.

38:09.749 --> 38:11.549
You sure you're ready
for this, Haydie, baby?

38:11.583 --> 38:14.552
Yeah, I was born ready.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.554
Misha, last chance.

38:16.588 --> 38:19.624
It's a hard pass for me.

38:19.659 --> 38:20.693
I told you already,
I know better

38:20.726 --> 38:21.928
than to challenge her.

38:21.961 --> 38:23.162
You go get
your ass kicked alone.

38:23.195 --> 38:25.865
Guys, the light here
is so pretty.

38:25.898 --> 38:29.035
Let's get our group pic now
before the light changes.

38:33.873 --> 38:36.608
That's a nice little setup
you got going there.

38:36.642 --> 38:38.711
Oh, yeah. I love it.

38:38.744 --> 38:40.780
So this little thing
holds my phone,

38:40.813 --> 38:44.016
and I can take pictures
or videos

38:44.050 --> 38:45.184
with this little thing.

38:45.217 --> 38:48.620
It's great, it has something
like a 50-yard range.

38:50.222 --> 38:52.224
All right, y'all.
Come on, scooch in,

38:52.258 --> 38:53.893
scrunch in over there,

38:53.926 --> 38:57.763
and let's just look like
we like each other.

39:00.132 --> 39:01.901
There's no Wi-Fi out here.
How does it work?

39:01.934 --> 39:04.070
It's a camera, not a phone.

39:04.103 --> 39:08.107
You don't need service
for a camera, Grandpa.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.809
Another Grandpa crack.

39:09.842 --> 39:10.810
Didn't know the extra years

39:10.843 --> 39:12.577
were already a fucking problem
for you here.

39:12.610 --> 39:13.813
All right,
on the count of three,

39:13.846 --> 39:15.948
let's all say,
"Hayden is old as hell!"

39:15.982 --> 39:17.582
One, two, three!

39:17.615 --> 39:20.585
Hayden is old as hell.

39:20.618 --> 39:22.620
Boom, Grandpa's gonna
beat your ass!

39:22.655 --> 39:23.956
Honey, can you grab my stuff

39:23.990 --> 39:25.257
and I'll meet you
back at the ranch?

39:25.291 --> 39:27.525
I'm gonna get you!

39:27.559 --> 39:30.096
Cheatin'-ass motherfucker!

39:38.037 --> 39:40.538
What do you say, head back?

39:40.572 --> 39:42.208
Absolutely.

39:51.751 --> 39:53.986
Looks like Bo-Lee went out
for the afternoon, huh?

39:54.020 --> 39:55.221
Yeah.

39:55.254 --> 39:57.622
Probably to bury
some more bodies.

39:58.991 --> 40:00.793
You want some more?

40:02.628 --> 40:03.629
- No.
- Here, buddy.

40:03.662 --> 40:06.132
He's done.

40:10.069 --> 40:11.937
Come on, want to take a walk?

40:11.971 --> 40:13.939
Oh, it's cold.

40:25.718 --> 40:28.320
It's so pretty out here.

40:28.354 --> 40:29.722
I know.

40:29.755 --> 40:30.990
No, it is,
it's really beautiful...

40:31.023 --> 40:33.793
It's almost like you forget
how not peaceful the city is!

40:35.895 --> 40:37.163
I know.

40:37.196 --> 40:40.598
It's so different here.

40:40.633 --> 40:42.134
I know.

40:44.036 --> 40:45.704
- But it's cold.
- You cold?

40:45.738 --> 40:46.939
Yeah.

40:46.972 --> 40:48.240
I am.

40:55.815 --> 40:58.084
- Better?
- Almost.

41:10.729 --> 41:13.032
- I don't care anymore.
- I know.

41:14.767 --> 41:16.402
We got to be smart
about this, okay?

41:16.435 --> 41:19.638
Like you said.

41:19.672 --> 41:22.108
Not anymore.

41:22.141 --> 41:23.876
I hate it.

41:23.909 --> 41:26.078
I hate living in the house
with him.

41:26.112 --> 41:27.746
- You don't understand.
- I know.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.416
- You don't understand.
- I know...

41:30.449 --> 41:33.119
- I can't.
- I know, I know.

41:33.152 --> 41:35.121
I can't, I can't.

41:35.154 --> 41:37.289
I know, I know.

41:39.959 --> 41:42.061
And it's over.

41:42.094 --> 41:44.230
It is.

41:44.263 --> 41:46.332
Just haven't told her yet.

41:50.269 --> 41:52.872
Hey, you know something?

41:54.773 --> 41:57.309
- She's a good person.
- She is.

41:57.343 --> 41:59.211
She doesn't deserve for this
to go down in a shitty way.

41:59.245 --> 42:01.413
It's not like you and Hayden.

42:01.447 --> 42:05.184
We just fell
out of love is all.

42:09.355 --> 42:12.291
You're gonna leave her,
though, right?

42:12.324 --> 42:14.260
Yes.

42:17.796 --> 42:20.166
You haven't left Hayden yet.

42:20.199 --> 42:21.901
- Jesus.
- Hey, hey, hey,

42:21.934 --> 42:23.169
that came out the wrong way.

42:23.202 --> 42:25.070
Hey, babe, it came out
the wrong way.

42:25.104 --> 42:28.207
I'm sorry.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.909
This is a fucked-up situation.

42:29.942 --> 42:31.911
- Right?
- Yes.

42:31.944 --> 42:34.213
We just got to figure out
how to best advocate this,

42:34.246 --> 42:35.447
smartly.

42:38.450 --> 42:40.152
Okay.

42:44.490 --> 42:47.259
I can't stand the way
he treats you.

42:48.861 --> 42:51.897
Just cast away what he has.

42:51.931 --> 42:53.399
Babe...

42:55.301 --> 42:56.368
What he had.

42:56.402 --> 42:59.305
- What he had.
- Yes.

42:59.338 --> 43:02.141
After this weekend,

43:02.174 --> 43:03.442
it's you and me.

43:06.145 --> 43:08.147
- I love you.
- I love you.

43:09.181 --> 43:10.449
I love you so much.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.142
- Yo, hey!
- Jesus Christ.

43:39.445 --> 43:40.846
Hold up, bro.

43:40.879 --> 43:41.914
Wait a minute.

43:41.947 --> 43:44.250
Listen, that is not
what it looked like, all right?

43:44.283 --> 43:45.451
Okay?

43:47.019 --> 43:48.554
We cool here?

43:50.289 --> 43:52.925
My daddy had a sayin'.

43:52.958 --> 43:54.526
From the Bible, I think.

43:59.932 --> 44:05.838
"Be sure your sin
will find you out."

44:05.871 --> 44:07.906
Boy.

44:12.211 --> 44:15.481
I smell fire and brimstone
coming for you.

44:16.515 --> 44:18.083
Bo-Lee.

44:18.117 --> 44:19.485
Bo-Lee, please.

44:19.518 --> 44:21.987
Please don't say anything
to my husband.

44:22.021 --> 44:23.989
It's... it's complicated.

44:25.224 --> 44:27.393
Please don't say anything.

44:39.571 --> 44:40.774
Thank you.

44:40.806 --> 44:42.841
I don't know, if it wasn't
for this Achilles injury,

44:42.875 --> 44:44.043
I might've had you this time.

44:44.076 --> 44:45.944
Oh, please, you're gonna
make excuses now?

44:45.978 --> 44:47.246
What?

44:47.279 --> 44:48.414
Achilles injury is no joke!

44:48.447 --> 44:50.949
It's like someone lit
the back of your foot on fire.

44:50.983 --> 44:52.217
There you guys are!

44:52.251 --> 44:53.952
- Hey, hi!
- Hey!

44:53.986 --> 44:55.521
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Bo-Lee!

44:56.555 --> 44:57.423
Where are you going?

44:57.456 --> 44:59.892
You don't need to leave
on our account!

44:59.925 --> 45:03.462
Oh, uh, I mentioned
I'm not gonna be around tonight.

45:03.495 --> 45:05.064
My brother's in town.

45:05.097 --> 45:06.633
Gonna be staying at the casino.

45:06.666 --> 45:07.966
No, you didn't mention it.

45:08.567 --> 45:11.070
Yeah, yeah.

45:11.103 --> 45:12.871
I might not even come back
tomorrow.

45:12.905 --> 45:15.541
My brother, he's a wild one.

45:15.574 --> 45:18.277
We start dippin' into
that whiskey,

45:18.310 --> 45:20.446
we get into all sorts of sin.

45:27.419 --> 45:29.555
So, who won?

45:29.588 --> 45:30.956
Your wife did, man!

45:30.989 --> 45:32.024
She's a machine!

45:32.057 --> 45:33.258
She smoked my ass!

45:33.292 --> 45:34.293
Yeah, we're gonna have
to start getting

45:34.326 --> 45:35.461
some new people on these trips

45:35.494 --> 45:37.896
so I can have some,
like, real competition.

45:38.698 --> 45:40.032
Oh, I gotta pee.

45:49.642 --> 45:51.410
Shit, shit.

45:52.945 --> 45:53.946
Dammit.

45:55.948 --> 45:58.651
It's not in the car either.

45:58.685 --> 46:00.619
I know it's not
in the car, Chris.

46:00.653 --> 46:02.054
I put it right back in the bag.

46:02.087 --> 46:03.589
It was right next
to my suitcase last night.

46:03.622 --> 46:05.391
Okay, okay,
I'm just trying to help you.

46:05.424 --> 46:07.226
I am fucked
if it doesn't turn up.

46:07.259 --> 46:08.427
It will, it will!

46:08.460 --> 46:10.996
- It's gotta be here somewhere.
- Shit!

46:12.264 --> 46:13.198
Fuck!

46:14.032 --> 46:15.100
Anything?

46:15.134 --> 46:17.136
Misha hasn't seen it.

46:17.169 --> 46:18.270
Shit.

46:20.406 --> 46:22.675
How could it just
disappear like that?

46:22.709 --> 46:24.276
Did you use it today?

46:24.309 --> 46:26.545
No, I promised Chris
I wouldn't use it

46:26.578 --> 46:28.313
until after the hike.

46:28.347 --> 46:29.682
Shit.

46:34.420 --> 46:37.289
- Oh, man.
- What's up?

46:37.322 --> 46:38.424
I'm not accusing him, but...

46:40.426 --> 46:44.296
I mean, Bo-Lee, when he came
and changed that light bulb,

46:44.329 --> 46:46.031
he could've just walked
right in here

46:46.064 --> 46:48.000
and then snatched your laptop.

46:48.033 --> 46:49.669
But he never came in here.

46:49.702 --> 46:52.237
Look, he could've just
walked straight in here

46:52.271 --> 46:54.072
and then straight out,

46:54.106 --> 46:55.474
- we would have never known.
- You know, you're right,

46:55.507 --> 46:57.142
and he had that big bag
with him, too.

46:59.044 --> 47:02.014
So you think he just
came in here and grabbed it?

47:02.047 --> 47:03.650
He could've came in here
when we were on our hike, too,

47:03.683 --> 47:06.552
but all of our stuff
is still here.

47:06.585 --> 47:08.187
Yeah, mine too,
as far as I know.

47:10.589 --> 47:12.624
Fuckin' son of a bitch.

47:12.659 --> 47:14.593
Babe, his car's not here,
he's not gonna answer.

47:14.626 --> 47:16.361
Well, then I'ma go in
and take what's mine.

47:16.395 --> 47:19.097
That's not a good idea, Nora,
listen to me, stop!

47:19.131 --> 47:21.133
Hey, I hear you,
but you can't just go

47:21.166 --> 47:22.501
breaking into his place.

47:22.534 --> 47:24.570
I was just throwing
scenarios out up there, okay?

47:24.603 --> 47:25.672
We don't know that he took it.

47:25.705 --> 47:26.706
Of course he did!

47:29.141 --> 47:31.510
Nora, there's nothing we can do
right now, he's not home!

47:31.543 --> 47:33.646
Let's go have dinner, okay?

47:33.680 --> 47:34.613
Then after dinner,
we'll come back

47:34.647 --> 47:36.381
- and then I'll confront him.
- No, Chris,

47:36.415 --> 47:40.252
what if he's in town now
selling my computer?

47:40.285 --> 47:42.354
I don't have
Bo-Lee's number, okay,

47:42.387 --> 47:44.791
but I will call the owner,
I'll go on the website,

47:44.824 --> 47:46.258
I'll look for
an emergency number,

47:46.291 --> 47:48.193
and we will track him down.

47:48.227 --> 47:50.429
Well, tell them
I want to press charges.

47:50.462 --> 47:52.297
I don't think that's
the right way to do it.

47:52.331 --> 47:53.131
I think we should say,

47:53.165 --> 47:54.801
if he brings it back
in one piece,

47:54.834 --> 47:57.236
we won't press charges.

47:57.269 --> 47:59.371
Otherwise, hey, you bring
the hammer down on him.

47:59.404 --> 48:01.273
Yeah, there you go,
that's smart thinking.

48:01.306 --> 48:03.075
Come on, let's get some food.

48:06.345 --> 48:07.579
Sorry.

48:24.530 --> 48:27.165
All right, so I'm a freshman
on varsity, right?

48:27.199 --> 48:28.600
At practice.

48:28.635 --> 48:30.770
I'm terrified, because this guy

48:30.803 --> 48:33.071
is not only a senior,
he's the captain,

48:33.105 --> 48:34.473
and he's a starting
running back, right?

48:34.506 --> 48:36.441
And I'm playing
scout team safety,

48:36.475 --> 48:38.610
so I say to myself, I say,
"Listen," I said,

48:38.645 --> 48:42.214
"Chris, you've gotta
make a hit on this guy

48:42.247 --> 48:44.349
that's gonna lay him out,"

48:44.383 --> 48:46.118
to get the respect
of the rest of the team.

48:46.151 --> 48:48.220
Kinda like
when you're in prison

48:48.253 --> 48:51.658
and you pick a fight
on the biggest guy

48:51.691 --> 48:54.827
so that everyone else knows
you're not to be messed with,

48:54.861 --> 48:56.663
- you know?
- Yeah, yeah?

48:56.696 --> 48:59.666
You know all of this
from all your years,

48:59.699 --> 49:01.366
you know, behind bars?

49:01.400 --> 49:03.168
Well, yeah, look,
I watch enough Locked Up

49:03.201 --> 49:05.470
to know that that's
a pretty spot-on analogy.

49:05.504 --> 49:06.706
Am I right?

49:06.739 --> 49:09.474
The point is, I read the play...

49:09.508 --> 49:11.543
Read the play? No, no, no.

49:11.577 --> 49:12.845
- You knew the play.
- Eh.

49:12.879 --> 49:14.346
You were the third
string running back.

49:14.379 --> 49:15.480
- Here we go.
- You just decide

49:15.514 --> 49:16.548
to blow the play up!

49:16.582 --> 49:18.317
- Freshmen, right?
- I will not confirm or deny

49:18.350 --> 49:19.652
whether or not I knew
which play was coming,

49:19.686 --> 49:21.754
but the point is
I did blow it up,

49:21.788 --> 49:24.189
'cause I came running in
at 100 miles an hour.

49:24.222 --> 49:25.624
But this crazy SOB

49:25.658 --> 49:27.727
comes running in
at 200 miles an hour

49:27.760 --> 49:31.898
and bam, we have a collision
that is heard for miles.

49:31.931 --> 49:33.365
The rest of the team,
they stop what they're doing

49:33.398 --> 49:35.668
to A, go nuts with applause
and cheers,

49:35.702 --> 49:37.436
and B, to make sure
that we're still alive.

49:37.469 --> 49:38.738
I take off my helmet,

49:38.771 --> 49:41.373
and I run to the wrong sideline,

49:41.406 --> 49:44.176
'cause I have no idea
where the hell I am.

49:44.209 --> 49:45.912
And this guy sees me
running out there,

49:45.945 --> 49:49.348
and he yells out to me,
he goes, "Hey, freshman!

49:49.381 --> 49:52.384
I remember my first tackle!

49:52.417 --> 49:53.753
You won't!"

49:56.221 --> 49:57.356
Have I said this before?

49:57.389 --> 49:58.758
Have I told you guys
this story before?

49:58.791 --> 50:00.793
No, babe!

50:00.827 --> 50:02.461
But what Chris fails
to mention is

50:02.494 --> 50:04.363
that by the end of the year,

50:04.396 --> 50:07.265
he was the starting
running back,

50:07.299 --> 50:09.636
so I had to live
with losing my job

50:09.669 --> 50:11.603
- to a freshman.
- That's not how it went down,

50:11.638 --> 50:14.807
- was it?
- Well, I almost forgot.

50:14.841 --> 50:16.274
Who's up for some tequila, yeah?

50:16.308 --> 50:17.810
- Oh, mm-mm.
- Tequila!

50:17.844 --> 50:19.444
- Yeah? Tequila time!
- Oh, no!

50:19.478 --> 50:21.246
Let's do some shots!

50:21.279 --> 50:25.250
Doesn't matter what you say,
'cause you're all doing 'em!

50:25.283 --> 50:26.451
Oh.

50:26.485 --> 50:29.321
Yeah, he likes to drink.

50:29.354 --> 50:32.391
Oh, God, I don't think
I could do another drink.

50:32.424 --> 50:34.827
After today,
you deserve all the drinks.

50:34.861 --> 50:36.361
Mm.

50:36.395 --> 50:39.531
By the way, guys,
I wanna make a bet,

50:39.564 --> 50:41.199
100 to 1, he comes back,

50:41.233 --> 50:42.769
he's gonna wanna play
a drinking game.

50:42.802 --> 50:44.336
What is this, high school?

50:44.369 --> 50:46.739
I'm gonna get as drunk
as possible tonight.

50:46.773 --> 50:48.708
That's my plan.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.609
- Mm-hm.
- All right, all right!

50:50.643 --> 50:52.511
Shots, shots, shots!

50:52.544 --> 50:54.814
There you go, ladies!

50:56.783 --> 50:58.818
And one for my man over here.

51:00.485 --> 51:02.655
I think that calls
for a toast, you know?

51:04.023 --> 51:06.625
To good friends,

51:06.659 --> 51:08.895
to good times.

51:08.928 --> 51:12.865
To a happy life,
but most of all,

51:12.899 --> 51:14.667
to my beautiful wife.

51:16.803 --> 51:18.403
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

51:18.437 --> 51:20.338
Salut.

51:20.372 --> 51:21.440
Cheers.

51:24.777 --> 51:26.611
Oh!

51:26.646 --> 51:28.613
It's not so bad, actually.

51:28.648 --> 51:30.449
Good job.

51:30.482 --> 51:31.751
Always good stuff, man.

51:31.784 --> 51:33.986
- Oh.
- It better be good stuff.

51:34.020 --> 51:35.955
It cost more
than your car payment does.

51:40.026 --> 51:41.694
What do you guys think?

51:41.728 --> 51:43.763
Drinking game?

51:43.796 --> 51:45.397
Told you.

51:45.430 --> 51:46.999
I, for one, am not in the mood

51:47.033 --> 51:48.701
to be bouncing quarters

51:48.735 --> 51:51.503
and throwing
ping pong balls, no.

51:51.536 --> 51:53.740
Hey, Debbie Downer!

51:53.773 --> 51:54.907
We don't have
to play a game like that.

51:54.941 --> 51:57.710
Why don't we play something
a little more grown up.

51:57.744 --> 51:59.846
How about truth or dare?

51:59.879 --> 52:02.014
Okay, what, are we having
a sleepover now?

52:02.048 --> 52:03.281
Should I get my jammies?

52:03.315 --> 52:05.051
No, no!

52:05.084 --> 52:07.619
Come on, this'll take
your mind off of things.

52:07.653 --> 52:10.422
I know you're upset about
what happened today, all right?

52:10.455 --> 52:11.791
I called the owners,

52:11.824 --> 52:13.425
they're gonna try
and get a hold of him,

52:13.458 --> 52:15.293
and everything's gonna be okay.

52:15.327 --> 52:17.764
All right? I promise you.

52:17.797 --> 52:19.531
Thank you for making the calls,
I appreciate that.

52:22.869 --> 52:24.704
Okay, good then! Let's play.

52:28.440 --> 52:30.609
Oh, yes, girl!

52:30.643 --> 52:32.344
Whooo!

52:32.377 --> 52:33.679
Yeah, girl!

52:37.449 --> 52:39.618
- Oh!
- Oh!

52:51.530 --> 52:53.365
Oh, shit.

52:53.398 --> 52:54.499
That's hot.

52:54.533 --> 52:55.467
Wait, hold on.

52:59.138 --> 53:00.640
- Shoot the shoe!
- Do it!

53:00.673 --> 53:02.909
Do it! Do it! Do it!

53:02.942 --> 53:04.476
Come on, man!

53:04.509 --> 53:05.912
Shoot that shoe.

53:08.948 --> 53:11.383
Don't you dare kiss me
with that mouth!

53:12.151 --> 53:14.619
I was 17,

53:14.654 --> 53:16.421
and I kicked her ass.

53:18.791 --> 53:20.559
Don't mess with Nora!

53:20.592 --> 53:22.028
Proud of that shit.

53:23.663 --> 53:26.398
Pulled her hair all the way out,
started that mohawk trend.

53:26.431 --> 53:27.767
I did that.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.534
Pulled that shit out
on the side, baby.

53:29.568 --> 53:30.903
Truth or dare?

53:33.538 --> 53:35.141
Dare.

53:35.174 --> 53:36.474
Perfect.

53:36.508 --> 53:38.978
I dare you to take
that phone out of yours

53:39.011 --> 53:43.548
and read your last
three text messages out loud.

53:43.582 --> 53:45.051
No, girl.

53:45.084 --> 53:46.118
Hmm.

53:49.521 --> 53:50.522
Shit.

53:52.158 --> 53:53.525
Wow.

53:53.558 --> 53:54.861
Of course not.

53:54.894 --> 53:57.063
You and that fucking
precious phone of yours.

53:57.096 --> 53:59.832
Yup. It's my fucking phone.

53:59.866 --> 54:01.701
Baby.

54:01.734 --> 54:03.870
I got it, I got it, I got it.

54:05.638 --> 54:10.542
When you two have
your little bundle of joy,

54:10.575 --> 54:12.544
who do you want it to look like?

54:12.577 --> 54:13.746
Neither.

54:13.779 --> 54:15.181
We ain't gonna have any.

54:15.214 --> 54:17.549
It's not your turn, asshole.

54:17.582 --> 54:19.484
It'll happen, buddy.

54:19.517 --> 54:21.519
Oh, no.

54:21.553 --> 54:23.189
No, you see, it's not.

54:23.222 --> 54:27.126
Because Mrs. Under-Fucking-21
here, she's incapable.

54:30.462 --> 54:32.031
You know what

54:32.064 --> 54:34.867
you always fail to mention?

54:34.901 --> 54:38.004
Is that his fucking sperm count

54:38.037 --> 54:40.840
is as low as a fucking corpse,

54:40.873 --> 54:43.109
you fucking old man.

54:43.142 --> 54:44.509
What the fuck?

54:44.542 --> 54:46.145
Well, science seemed
to say otherwise

54:46.178 --> 54:48.948
when my ex-girlfriend
got pregnant.

54:48.981 --> 54:52.885
You wanna go down that road
about what happened?

54:52.919 --> 54:54.552
- Okay...
- About what happened

54:54.586 --> 54:57.056
- to your girlfriend?
- I wanna go down that road.

54:57.089 --> 54:58.157
- Let's go down that road.
- You don't want to go

54:58.190 --> 54:59.792
down that road...

55:01.093 --> 55:02.228
...after you left her.

55:02.261 --> 55:03.696
I should not have asked that.

55:03.729 --> 55:05.597
That's my fault,
I should not have asked...

55:05.631 --> 55:06.933
that was
an insensitive question.

55:06.966 --> 55:08.067
I'm sorry, y'all.

55:08.100 --> 55:09.769
Let's do another question.

55:09.802 --> 55:11.771
Yeah, he's right,
let's do another question.

55:11.804 --> 55:14.506
But first, I just want
to make it clear,

55:14.539 --> 55:17.977
the reason that I left
was because I think

55:18.010 --> 55:20.980
the decision to have a child
should be between two people,

55:21.013 --> 55:23.716
not just the woman,
not just the woman.

55:23.749 --> 55:26.518
Yes, it is between two people,
you motherfucker!

55:26.551 --> 55:28.821
You can't force me
to have a child,

55:28.854 --> 55:33.259
- and you never took me in...
- Who says you get to decide?

55:33.292 --> 55:35.527
You're forcing me all the time,

55:35.560 --> 55:38.864
- and you think it's two people...
- You are so fucking dramatic!

55:38.898 --> 55:41.801
- Calm down!
- Go fuck yourself!

55:41.834 --> 55:43.903
Why don't you...
why don't you go

55:43.936 --> 55:45.570
have a cigarette,
whiskey dick, you...

55:45.603 --> 55:46.939
Mm.

55:46.973 --> 55:49.275
Drink up, that'll fix it.

55:49.308 --> 55:50.843
Fucking hypocrite.

55:50.876 --> 55:53.646
Your hypocrisy is
fucking endless.

55:55.547 --> 55:57.016
Fuck you!

55:59.685 --> 56:02.021
Whatever you fucking say.

56:02.054 --> 56:05.124
- Oh.
- Jesus Christ.

56:05.157 --> 56:07.193
Shit, man.

56:07.226 --> 56:09.962
Wow.

56:09.996 --> 56:12.031
I think I'm drunker
than I thought.

56:14.633 --> 56:20.538
Chris just starts smoking again
like he never quit.

56:20.572 --> 56:24.276
Shit, I gotta get
that computer back.

56:24.310 --> 56:26.679
- Oh, God, shit.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, shit.

56:26.712 --> 56:28.848
I got the spins, man.

56:28.881 --> 56:30.282
You got the spins?

56:30.316 --> 56:33.585
What, are you getting soft
on me, big guy?

56:33.618 --> 56:35.187
Hey.

56:35.221 --> 56:36.989
Whoa.

56:37.023 --> 56:39.158
Hey, buddy.

56:39.191 --> 56:40.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:40.793 --> 56:43.595
Jesus Christ.

56:43.629 --> 56:45.631
Come on, big fella.

56:45.664 --> 56:48.200
Come on, big fella,
let's get you...

56:49.835 --> 56:51.303
Let's get you up
and walk this off.

56:51.337 --> 56:52.838
I don't wanna fucking
do shots anymore.

56:52.872 --> 56:55.307
Yeah.

56:55.341 --> 56:57.209
But Chris thinks
I should just leave it alone.

56:57.243 --> 56:59.577
- Don't listen to him.
- And I'm like, I really need it.

56:59.611 --> 57:01.613
I really need to...

57:01.647 --> 57:03.082
oh, I've gotta do
something, right?

57:03.115 --> 57:04.984
Hold on a second.

57:05.017 --> 57:07.186
What... what the hell?

57:07.219 --> 57:09.822
Whoa, girl, girl,
what's wrong with you?

57:09.855 --> 57:11.357
- I'm good.
- You all right?

57:11.390 --> 57:12.557
Yeah.

57:15.027 --> 57:16.629
Come on.

57:18.931 --> 57:19.999
Why do you...

57:21.133 --> 57:22.635
That's not cool, man.

57:22.668 --> 57:26.038
You get so aggressive
with Misha.

57:26.072 --> 57:29.809
- You shouldn't get...
- It happens.

57:29.842 --> 57:31.377
- But just mean...
- It happens.

57:31.410 --> 57:35.848
- Too much. I'm fine.
- Okay, I'ma get you some water.

57:35.881 --> 57:38.084
- No, I'm good.
- I'll be right back.

57:38.117 --> 57:39.351
I'm fine.

57:41.087 --> 57:43.122
You get mean,
why do you get mean?

57:44.123 --> 57:45.925
Hey.

57:45.958 --> 57:47.960
I might lighten up on her
a little bit

57:47.993 --> 57:50.830
if she wasn't fucking
somebody else.

57:52.898 --> 57:54.033
What are you talking about, man?

57:54.066 --> 57:57.403
- What am I talking about?
- You guys have so much history.

57:59.305 --> 58:02.808
- You have history.
- History?

58:02.842 --> 58:04.176
What's that old saying, buddy?

58:04.210 --> 58:07.346
"History is just
a pack of lies agreed upon."

58:15.221 --> 58:16.722
What the fuck?

58:20.159 --> 58:21.961
Garbage.

58:21.994 --> 58:23.429
Garbage...

58:32.838 --> 58:34.440
Fuck.

58:34.473 --> 58:36.742
Bo-Lee.

58:36.775 --> 58:38.210
Fucking Bo-Lee!

58:40.779 --> 58:45.718
You know, I really shouldn't be
that surprised about Misha.

58:45.751 --> 58:49.288
'Cause they say
50% of relationships,

58:49.321 --> 58:52.892
somebody is having an affair.

58:56.328 --> 58:58.063
Challen...

58:59.932 --> 59:02.301
Challenges? No.

59:02.334 --> 59:07.072
Cheating, lying,
those aren't challenges.

59:08.941 --> 59:12.945
They are reasons
to fucking end shit.

1:00:02.895 --> 1:00:06.065
Apology not accepted.

1:01:07.259 --> 1:01:10.362
All right, girl, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1:01:10.396 --> 1:01:11.930
Come on, come on.

1:01:11.964 --> 1:01:14.900
- Is this still...
- Yes, it's okay.

1:01:14.933 --> 1:01:16.368
It's okay.

1:01:19.004 --> 1:01:20.205
Wake up.

1:01:22.074 --> 1:01:24.343
Is she that wasted?

1:01:24.376 --> 1:01:26.178
No, I think it's more than that.

1:01:26.211 --> 1:01:28.947
I think it might be
alcohol poisoning.

1:01:28.981 --> 1:01:31.183
Okay, we need to lay her down.

1:01:31.216 --> 1:01:34.420
- Come on.
- Actually, I've got an idea.

1:01:38.557 --> 1:01:40.125
Oh, shit.

1:01:43.295 --> 1:01:45.864
- I'm just sleepy.
- Mm-hm.

1:01:45.898 --> 1:01:47.032
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1:01:47.066 --> 1:01:49.268
Mm-hm, I see you.

1:01:49.301 --> 1:01:51.070
Come on, come on, girl.

1:01:52.571 --> 1:01:54.173
Dude, what's that?

1:01:54.206 --> 1:01:56.643
Oh.

1:01:56.676 --> 1:01:58.143
This?

1:01:58.177 --> 1:02:00.112
This is a delicious vodka soda.

1:02:00.145 --> 1:02:02.348
- I'm okay.
- She's gonna be fine.

1:02:02.381 --> 1:02:03.582
Trust me.

1:02:05.484 --> 1:02:07.453
Shit. Where is Chris?

1:02:08.688 --> 1:02:10.356
Chris is outside still.

1:02:10.389 --> 1:02:15.227
Must be a two cigarette
kinda night.

1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:18.330
Okay, well, are you gonna
help me or what?

1:02:18.364 --> 1:02:21.200
Or do I need to go get Chris?

1:02:21.233 --> 1:02:23.135
She's fine.

1:02:27.539 --> 1:02:29.341
What is that supposed to be?

1:02:31.443 --> 1:02:33.545
Are you doing drugs now, too?
Is that what's going on?

1:02:33.579 --> 1:02:35.581
That's why
you're acting so weird?

1:02:35.614 --> 1:02:37.449
Me?

1:02:37.483 --> 1:02:42.287
No, I'm not doing drugs,
but my beautiful wife, well...

1:02:45.491 --> 1:02:47.694
Wait, she... she's
doing drugs now, too?

1:02:47.727 --> 1:02:50.329
- Well...
- Is she mixing drugs

1:02:50.362 --> 1:02:52.564
- and alcohol?
- Not knowingly.

1:02:52.598 --> 1:02:56.969
But I put some in her drink.

1:02:57.002 --> 1:02:58.705
You know when I was making them
in the other room

1:02:58.738 --> 1:03:00.105
and I just brought 'em out here.

1:03:00.139 --> 1:03:01.974
I put it in Chris's drink, too.

1:03:02.007 --> 1:03:04.176
Makes it a lot less painful
that way.

1:03:04.209 --> 1:03:06.679
No, no, no, no, no, see,

1:03:06.713 --> 1:03:09.615
I didn't put anything
in your drink.

1:03:09.649 --> 1:03:12.451
But it's gonna be more painful.

1:03:52.725 --> 1:03:55.294
Good evening.

1:03:55.327 --> 1:03:56.228
You know, a lot has happened

1:03:56.261 --> 1:03:58.397
since you took
your little tiger snooze.

1:04:15.113 --> 1:04:16.315
You've got a gag in.

1:04:17.416 --> 1:04:19.686
My bad.

1:04:19.719 --> 1:04:22.020
Listen, I will make you a deal.

1:04:23.288 --> 1:04:25.357
If you promise not to scream,

1:04:25.390 --> 1:04:27.226
I will remove the gag.

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:32.064
But I am asking you,
for my sanity...

1:04:33.499 --> 1:04:36.235
I'm asking you not to scream.

1:04:36.268 --> 1:04:38.504
Now more importantly,
I want to explain to you

1:04:38.537 --> 1:04:41.373
what's going on here.

1:04:41.406 --> 1:04:43.175
Okay?

1:04:43.208 --> 1:04:45.010
So nod your head "yes."

1:04:46.411 --> 1:04:47.714
Yeah.

1:04:48.781 --> 1:04:51.049
That's my good girl.

1:04:56.522 --> 1:04:58.323
For your fucking sanity?

1:04:58.357 --> 1:05:00.425
It's pretty clear
you're insane.

1:05:00.459 --> 1:05:01.627
Where's Chris?

1:05:01.661 --> 1:05:03.730
Chris!

1:05:03.763 --> 1:05:05.497
And Misha!

1:05:07.099 --> 1:05:08.567
Did you hurt Chris?

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:11.470
Ooh, define "hurt."

1:05:12.872 --> 1:05:14.506
Just tell me.

1:05:14.540 --> 1:05:16.074
I'm fucking with you!

1:05:16.108 --> 1:05:18.076
Yeah, I hurt him!

1:05:18.110 --> 1:05:20.345
- I hurt him real bad.
- Oh.

1:05:20.379 --> 1:05:22.581
I hurt him so bad
he died, actually.

1:05:22.614 --> 1:05:23.816
Oh.

1:05:23.850 --> 1:05:24.817
Oh, God.

1:05:24.851 --> 1:05:27.152
Oh, please, God.

1:05:27.185 --> 1:05:28.453
You're fucking going
straight to hell,

1:05:28.487 --> 1:05:29.822
you piece of shit!

1:05:29.856 --> 1:05:31.824
You haven't even let me
explain to you yet

1:05:31.858 --> 1:05:34.493
what's going on.

1:05:34.526 --> 1:05:35.828
Once I do, you might
change your mind

1:05:35.862 --> 1:05:37.664
about some things.

1:05:37.697 --> 1:05:39.364
Misha was so sick.

1:05:39.398 --> 1:05:41.233
You drugged her.

1:05:41.266 --> 1:05:42.534
Did you kill her, too?

1:05:42.568 --> 1:05:45.137
No. No, I didn't kill her.

1:05:45.170 --> 1:05:46.438
She's out there.

1:05:46.471 --> 1:05:47.606
She's with Chris.

1:05:51.343 --> 1:05:55.480
That... that is the key phrase.

1:05:55.514 --> 1:05:58.851
The key phrase is "with Chris."

1:06:00.552 --> 1:06:04.891
You see, your husband,
my best friend,

1:06:04.924 --> 1:06:07.292
was fucking my wife.

1:06:08.427 --> 1:06:10.630
And I could almost deal
with that.

1:06:10.663 --> 1:06:13.565
The cheating, the sex.

1:06:14.834 --> 1:06:17.135
But it's the lying.

1:06:17.169 --> 1:06:18.805
It's the lying to my face

1:06:18.838 --> 1:06:22.140
like I am a fucking idiot.

1:06:24.176 --> 1:06:28.748
So you killed my husband
and your wife.

1:06:28.781 --> 1:06:32.685
You killed two people, for what?

1:06:32.719 --> 1:06:36.154
For your fucking ego?

1:06:38.323 --> 1:06:40.760
You just ruined your life, too.

1:06:40.793 --> 1:06:42.260
We all lose.

1:06:42.294 --> 1:06:43.663
You should be thanking me,

1:06:43.696 --> 1:06:46.933
because he was
disrespecting you, too.

1:06:46.966 --> 1:06:49.167
- He was making you look stupid.
- Fuck you!

1:06:49.201 --> 1:06:51.236
Fuck me, fuck them!

1:06:51.269 --> 1:06:53.706
Fuck them for cheating!

1:06:53.740 --> 1:06:55.507
Fuck them
for ruining friendships,

1:06:55.540 --> 1:06:56.876
for ruining marriages,

1:06:56.909 --> 1:07:00.545
for ruining our lives
when our backs were turned!

1:07:00.579 --> 1:07:01.513
I knew.

1:07:03.683 --> 1:07:04.917
I knew.

1:07:06.218 --> 1:07:08.286
What? Bullshit.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.657
Of course I knew.

1:07:10.690 --> 1:07:12.725
Chris can't even hide
a cigarette behind my back

1:07:12.759 --> 1:07:14.359
without me knowing.

1:07:14.393 --> 1:07:17.329
You think he can hide an affair?

1:07:17.362 --> 1:07:22.969
I was gonna fight,
no matter what the consequence.

1:07:23.002 --> 1:07:26.773
But the consequence
did not include murder.

1:07:26.806 --> 1:07:28.675
Because unlike you,

1:07:28.708 --> 1:07:33.311
I'm not willing
to throw my life away

1:07:33.345 --> 1:07:35.648
because someone disrespected me

1:07:35.682 --> 1:07:38.316
who didn't even love me anymore.

1:07:44.757 --> 1:07:47.359
Oh, Nora.

1:07:47.392 --> 1:07:49.762
I got more bad news for you.

1:07:49.796 --> 1:07:52.832
I'm not throwing away my life.

1:07:52.865 --> 1:07:55.600
And I'm sure as shit
not going to prison.

1:08:05.310 --> 1:08:07.512
Help! Murderer!

1:08:07.546 --> 1:08:09.448
Help us!

1:08:11.349 --> 1:08:12.250
Help!

1:08:12.284 --> 1:08:14.687
How... how did you get that
on my phone?

1:08:16.588 --> 1:08:20.358
I mean, you do know
someone has to take the fall

1:08:20.392 --> 1:08:22.829
for this messy situation,

1:08:22.862 --> 1:08:25.031
and it sure as hell
ain't gonna be me.

1:08:25.064 --> 1:08:26.531
That gadget you have,

1:08:26.565 --> 1:08:28.300
man, that thing
really comes in handy.

1:08:28.333 --> 1:08:30.770
But you should
really be more careful

1:08:30.803 --> 1:08:32.805
when you're
putting in your code,

1:08:32.839 --> 1:08:34.272
'cause you never know
who might be

1:08:34.306 --> 1:08:36.008
looking over your shoulder.

1:08:38.310 --> 1:08:40.646
If you think
that little fake video

1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:43.615
is gonna clear all of this up,

1:08:43.649 --> 1:08:45.785
then you really are insane.

1:08:47.754 --> 1:08:50.489
Of course not.

1:08:50.522 --> 1:08:53.492
That's why I had to borrow
something else from you.

1:08:55.895 --> 1:08:56.929
Hang tight.

1:09:24.991 --> 1:09:27.492
Bo-Lee didn't snag
your computer.

1:09:27.526 --> 1:09:28.895
I did.

1:09:28.928 --> 1:09:32.999
Been doing all kinds of
crazy shit on here recently.

1:09:33.032 --> 1:09:35.500
I mean, this thing
contains the ramblings

1:09:35.534 --> 1:09:37.103
of a woman scorned.

1:09:37.136 --> 1:09:40.673
I had a lot of time to plot
your wonderful revenge.

1:09:40.706 --> 1:09:41.641
Yeah.

1:09:41.674 --> 1:09:43.776
And now I needed
to add some stuff out here

1:09:43.810 --> 1:09:46.045
so the timestamp matched,

1:09:46.078 --> 1:09:47.947
but you realized
your computer went missing

1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:51.851
before I could sneak it
back in here to you.

1:09:51.884 --> 1:09:55.788
Yeah, well, actually,
this is my favorite part.

1:09:55.822 --> 1:09:58.390
This is a little bit corny,
but I just love it.

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:02.795
It's this.

1:10:02.829 --> 1:10:04.797
It's this, you recognize it?

1:10:06.398 --> 1:10:08.067
You recognize it? Huh?

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:09.769
It's your wedding knife.

1:10:09.802 --> 1:10:11.938
You used it to cut the cake.

1:10:11.971 --> 1:10:14.106
For the cake ceremony.

1:10:14.140 --> 1:10:16.075
I thought it was brilliant!

1:10:16.108 --> 1:10:19.111
I mean, it really shows
your state of mind.

1:10:19.145 --> 1:10:21.781
Now you're using it
as the murder weapon?

1:10:21.814 --> 1:10:24.449
You naughty girl.

1:10:24.482 --> 1:10:26.752
Naughty girl.

1:10:26.786 --> 1:10:30.156
And what are you gonna do
when Bo-Lee comes back, huh?

1:10:30.189 --> 1:10:32.091
Or have you thought about that?

1:10:32.124 --> 1:10:34.392
I did!

1:10:34.426 --> 1:10:36.528
It actually works out perfect.

1:10:36.561 --> 1:10:38.496
Him leaving for the night?

1:10:38.530 --> 1:10:40.967
I can finish you off

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.368
and make as much noise
as I want to.

1:10:44.603 --> 1:10:46.739
And then when I'm done,

1:10:46.772 --> 1:10:51.077
I'll take this, just jab it
through my love handle,

1:10:51.110 --> 1:10:53.511
maybe add a few
little rope burns.

1:10:54.747 --> 1:10:57.183
Play dead.

1:10:57.216 --> 1:11:01.486
Bo-Lee shows up, sees me
on the ground half dead,

1:11:01.519 --> 1:11:04.456
and I dazzle him
with my amazing story

1:11:04.489 --> 1:11:06.625
about how I fought you off

1:11:06.659 --> 1:11:10.796
in your murderous rampage.

1:11:10.830 --> 1:11:13.833
Bo-Lee, that simple
motherfucker.

1:11:13.866 --> 1:11:16.669
He's gonna become
the MVP of this story,

1:11:16.702 --> 1:11:18.503
my star witness.

1:11:23.209 --> 1:11:24.576
See that?

1:11:24.609 --> 1:11:28.546
That's the answer
to your other question.

1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:30.216
Is Misha dead?

1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:37.522
I wouldn't buy any Misha stock
if I were you.

1:11:42.094 --> 1:11:43.095
No.

1:11:43.129 --> 1:11:45.197
Hayden, you don't have to...
Hayden, don't!

1:11:45.231 --> 1:11:47.599
You don't have to do this,
you don't have to do it.

1:11:47.633 --> 1:11:48.935
Shh.

1:11:48.968 --> 1:11:50.102
I'll just be a minute.

1:11:52.071 --> 1:11:53.873
Oh, God, oh, God.

1:11:55.207 --> 1:11:57.542
Oh, shit, no.

1:11:57.575 --> 1:11:59.679
No, no, no.

1:11:59.712 --> 1:12:00.813
No.

1:12:21.033 --> 1:12:22.268
Oh, shit.

1:12:47.592 --> 1:12:49.594
Come on. Come on, come on.

1:13:51.090 --> 1:13:53.059
Nora.

1:13:53.092 --> 1:13:54.894
I'm sorry that you have to die.

1:13:57.296 --> 1:13:59.999
And that you have to take
the blame for all of this.

1:14:03.936 --> 1:14:07.306
Life's unpredictable that way.

1:14:07.339 --> 1:14:11.710
I mean, sometimes we are tested
and we prevail.

1:14:13.746 --> 1:14:18.050
Sometimes,
we are just too broken.

1:14:20.352 --> 1:14:24.290
But it's the ending.

1:14:24.323 --> 1:14:26.792
The ending
we're never prepared for.

1:14:32.865 --> 1:14:34.033
And this is how yours ends.

1:14:35.401 --> 1:14:36.802
No, I'm pregnant, please!

1:14:39.171 --> 1:14:40.673
That's why I wanted
to work on our marriage,

1:14:40.706 --> 1:14:43.776
because... for the baby.

1:14:54.887 --> 1:14:55.988
Did Chris know?

1:14:58.424 --> 1:15:00.059
No.

1:15:05.331 --> 1:15:06.699
Pregnant.

1:15:31.891 --> 1:15:35.327
Well, at least you spared him
that sorrow.

1:15:58.817 --> 1:16:00.452
This is their fault.

1:16:00.486 --> 1:16:01.320
Come on.

1:16:02.788 --> 1:16:04.957
This is on them,
this is not you.

1:16:04.990 --> 1:16:06.458
All right?

1:16:06.492 --> 1:16:07.459
All right.

1:16:08.294 --> 1:16:09.828
Come on.

1:16:09.862 --> 1:16:11.764
They put me in this position.

1:16:11.797 --> 1:16:13.432
Right, they put me
in this position.

1:16:13.465 --> 1:16:16.468
Not me. This is on them.

1:16:16.502 --> 1:16:18.270
This is their fault,
this is their fault,

1:16:18.304 --> 1:16:19.438
not my fault!

1:16:19.471 --> 1:16:20.873
This is their fault!

1:16:20.906 --> 1:16:22.408
It's theirs!

1:16:43.896 --> 1:16:45.931
Clever girl.

1:17:04.083 --> 1:17:06.919
You killed Chris
and you killed Misha,

1:17:06.952 --> 1:17:09.021
and then I had to intervene.

1:17:09.054 --> 1:17:12.091
I told you this pain
was no joke!

1:17:33.579 --> 1:17:35.214
You hit me in my weak spot.

1:17:36.982 --> 1:17:38.417
Now I've gotta hurt you.

1:17:40.853 --> 1:17:43.289
Oh! Fuck!

1:18:00.172 --> 1:18:01.874
No.

1:18:12.985 --> 1:18:14.620
Bo-Lee!

1:18:14.654 --> 1:18:17.356
Bo-Lee! Bo-Lee!

1:18:17.389 --> 1:18:18.524
Bo-Lee!

1:18:20.526 --> 1:18:22.127
Shit!

1:18:25.164 --> 1:18:28.600
Bo-Lee! Bo-Lee!

1:18:36.475 --> 1:18:39.345
Come on, Nora, come on, come on.

1:18:45.184 --> 1:18:46.418
Bo-Lee.

1:18:48.253 --> 1:18:49.621
Bo-Lee!

1:18:53.125 --> 1:18:54.126
Shit.

1:18:54.159 --> 1:18:55.194
Oh, goddamnit.

1:18:57.396 --> 1:19:00.199
Ow. Ow.

1:19:18.384 --> 1:19:20.619
Shit!

1:19:20.653 --> 1:19:23.222
Goddamnit!

1:19:48.380 --> 1:19:51.651
Come on, you fucking
son of a bitch.

1:19:51.684 --> 1:19:53.585
You fucking son of a bitch.

1:20:06.766 --> 1:20:08.567
How's that pain, asshole?

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.637
God, ah!

1:20:15.174 --> 1:20:18.310
Fuckin' bitch!

1:21:11.563 --> 1:21:13.165
Oh, God.

1:21:36.154 --> 1:21:37.356
911, what's your emergency?

1:21:37.389 --> 1:21:39.358
Yes, yes, hello.

1:21:39.391 --> 1:21:42.094
I have been attacked by a man
and he killed my husband

1:21:42.127 --> 1:21:44.263
and he killed his wife.

1:21:44.296 --> 1:21:46.265
No, I don't know...

1:22:28.173 --> 1:22:31.143
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.

1:22:41.754 --> 1:22:44.156
You die now, bitch!

1:23:30.602 --> 1:23:32.437
Just hear me out,
just listen to me.

1:23:34.239 --> 1:23:36.541
You might want to step aside.

1:24:39.672 --> 1:24:41.874
I decided to come home early.
Good thing, huh?

1:24:43.976 --> 1:24:46.713
Coppers on the way.

1:24:46.746 --> 1:24:48.547
You're okay now.
