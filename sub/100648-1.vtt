00:04.091 --> 00:06.136
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

00:06.180 --> 00:07.311
- I think you could
be something.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.660
- He's making money
off our backs.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.358
- Yeah, and with our asses
on the line.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.055
- Why don't you just tell me
what you're looking for.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.796
- 50/50.
Do we have a deal or not?

00:13.839 --> 00:15.667
- Mm-hmm.
- Great.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.192
- They're counterfeiters.
The paper's all totally legit,

00:18.235 --> 00:19.584
but the bills are all
in sequence.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.108
- How's it going
with the sister?

00:21.151 --> 00:22.805
- They're after you, FBI.

00:22.848 --> 00:25.025
- I love you.
- So what happens next?

00:25.068 --> 00:26.809
- Stan is in a jail cell.

00:26.852 --> 00:27.984
- Because of us.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.464
- I'm out on leave.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.074
Can't even get my old job
back at the mall

00:31.118 --> 00:32.206
6because they think
I'm a felon.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.685
Never again though, right?

00:33.729 --> 00:35.035
- Okay.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.949
What do you want?
- Her.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.168
- Are you gonna arrest me?

00:38.212 --> 00:39.822
- Thanks for the coffee.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.346
- Oh, my God, and then what?
- Let's see how you do.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.913
- I made you something.

00:43.956 --> 00:46.176
It's literally like
nail-polish remover,

00:46.220 --> 00:48.091
hydrogen peroxide,
and bleach.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.440
- What's that thing
I always tell you

00:49.484 --> 00:51.268
when you make a big ol' mess?

00:51.312 --> 00:52.965
- That I gotta clean it up.
- All right, come on.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.532
No more grown-up talk.

00:54.576 --> 00:57.100
- That's your problem.
Take care of it.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
- He's not my problem.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.712
- Shut your mouth, bitch,
okay, and just hand--

01:06.457 --> 01:07.589
- Go.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.373
What do you say
I call him now?

01:09.417 --> 01:12.550
You still got odds.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.987
- We got a deal?

01:15.031 --> 01:17.903
- We can totally do this
without him.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.210
We're free.

01:22.952 --> 01:26.129
It's a shock when someone dies.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.264
The lights go out.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.354
One last breath.

01:34.268 --> 01:36.618
That's it.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.141
The end.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.798
So quick.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.891
But it stays with you.

02:03.558 --> 02:07.039
- Wait, what color is that?

02:07.083 --> 02:10.347
- Bubble Gum Bellini.
- I wanted Kiss My Lips Pink.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.654
- But you said
Bubble Gum Bellini.

02:17.006 --> 02:19.182
B-R-B.

02:20.575 --> 02:24.666
- This person that you knew,
or whatever...

02:27.103 --> 02:29.540
they're just gone.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.196
And it's so weird.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.418
'Cause, like...

02:40.551 --> 02:43.293
Did you ever know him at all?

02:43.337 --> 02:47.515
- Yeah, I didn't.
He just worked for my mom.

02:48.211 --> 02:51.171
She said get one of those
sad cards.

02:51.214 --> 02:54.478
- On the back wall.
To the right.

A big dog.

two parts Creamsicle Sunset.

Mmm.

06:28.431 --> 06:29.737
- Mmm...

06:29.780 --> 06:33.175

or a bad "mmm"?

- This ain't gonna fly.
- Why not?

06:39.007 --> 06:41.488
- Your Hamilton's whack.
- Wha--

06:41.531 --> 06:43.228
Just test it in the machine.
- Don't need to.

06:43.272 --> 06:46.231
- It would help if you could
pinpoint what exactly is whack

06:46.275 --> 06:48.799
so we could make adjustments.
- All right.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.889
- Check it.
First up.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.717
Your boy's bouffant
is wildin' out.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.458

Where?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.068
Hairline's off
about seventeen microns.

06:57.112 --> 06:59.549
- What program did you use
this time?

06:59.593 --> 07:01.508
- You know...
I don't know.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.813
- How do you not know?

07:02.857 --> 07:04.467
- It was Editor's Choice
in MacWorld.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
- And what's going on here?

07:06.077 --> 07:07.644
Looks like you got an extra
shadow right there.

07:07.688 --> 07:10.038
- No, that--that is exactly
his little thingy.

07:10.081 --> 07:12.083
- You trippin'
if that's how you think

07:12.127 --> 07:13.911
our founding father
wears his cravat.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.870
- These are microscopic
inconsistencies.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.915
It's close enough.
- Okay, boo.

07:17.959 --> 07:20.048
Close enough 'll get you
ten to twenty in the state pen.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.833
- Can you please just put it
in the machine?

07:23.617 --> 07:27.055
- How long did this batch take?
- Three weeks.

07:27.925 --> 07:30.145
- How many ones you shred?

07:37.282 --> 07:39.807
Denied.

07:42.897 --> 07:46.161
Rome wasn't built in a day.
- It burnt down in a night.

08:07.225 --> 08:10.141
- And I was like, Gwen, when
we're talking about my child,

08:10.185 --> 08:13.144
you do not wanna see
my temper get away from me.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.537
- Mmm, what did she say?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.365
- That it was
a pre-existing condition.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.932
- Hmm.
- But she would appeal

08:17.975 --> 08:20.369
the decision
with the powers that be.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.414
- Babe, I got us covered
this month.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.720
- That's not the point,
Stanley.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.505
We shouldn't have
to pay for meds.

08:25.548 --> 08:26.941
We pay for insurance.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.465
- Hey.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.162
- Hey, Krystal.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.034
- Hey, how do I heat
from frozen again?

08:33.077 --> 08:35.689
Hit baked potato twice, and
you wanna stir it in between.

08:35.732 --> 08:38.474
- Thanks, Stanimal.

08:44.132 --> 08:46.613
- Little Man
at dance class today.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.615
- Come on now.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.139
- Oh, and he says
he hates hip hop

08:51.182 --> 08:52.880
and wants to do tap
next year.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.751
- We worked so hard
on that stanky leg.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.232
- Is that your kid?
- Mm-hmm.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.713
That's Li'l Money right there.
- Aw.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.280
- And that's Miss Sara.
- Aw, she looks like you.

09:02.324 --> 09:05.240
And he looks like you.

09:05.283 --> 09:07.938
Aw, I just want to
eat their little faces.

09:07.982 --> 09:09.984
You know?

09:10.027 --> 09:12.203
So sweet, aww.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.729
I wanna have five kids.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.513
- I hope they look like that.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.037
- Here you go, baby.

09:22.344 --> 09:24.346
- Bye.
- See ya.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.870
- Bye.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.350
Oh, don't forget,
we have to go to

09:28.393 --> 09:30.439
that rummage sale
at the church on Saturday.

09:30.482 --> 09:33.311
I told them that we would try--
- Oops, you're right!

09:33.355 --> 09:36.314
One more on baked potato.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.926
- Tried to tell you.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.884
It's for our baby girl.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.761
- What do I hit for popcorn?

09:49.110 --> 09:51.373
- Popcorn.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.903
- Guys, socks and shoes.
We're going to the park.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.689
- I'm sick of the park.
- My socks are dirty.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.255
- Mine too.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.084
- Turn them inside out.
- We already did that.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.914
- Hey, you're home early.
- Yeah, I snuck out on break.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.395
I gotta get back.
Here.

10:13.438 --> 10:17.312
- Another blue envelope came.
- Thanks, honey.

10:19.009 --> 10:22.099
They're gonna take the house.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.058
- We just need
to make a payment.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.755
It'll get 'em off our backs.
- I'll ask for some more hours.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.714
Can you sell
some more hot tubs?

10:27.757 --> 10:30.368
- It's spas.
- Spas, sorry.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.632
- And coming up at five,

10:32.675 --> 10:35.373
channel four's own
Kristi Dooling joins the FBI

10:35.417 --> 10:38.333
on a dangerous raid,
as they continue their mission

10:38.376 --> 10:41.118
to clean up gang activity
on the Eastside--

10:41.162 --> 10:42.642
- You guys, now, come on.
- Mom!

10:42.685 --> 10:44.948
- Hey!
- Now in the car.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.385
- I think they've officially
OD'd on the park.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.387
- Well...

10:49.431 --> 10:50.954
it's free.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.217
So he would cry every time
the ball hit his foot,

10:53.261 --> 10:54.523
and I was like...

10:54.566 --> 10:55.742
"Sweetie, it's okay.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.613
It's soccer,
it's supposed to do that."

10:57.657 --> 10:59.006
Ugh, he's my hero.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.529
- So there's an opening
on the team.

11:00.572 --> 11:01.704
- Oh, my God.

11:01.748 --> 11:02.792
- I could talk
to Coach Freddy.

11:02.836 --> 11:03.967
- You don't have to do that.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.666
- It could be a good
distraction.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.104
How's he sleeping?

11:10.147 --> 11:13.368
- Last night,
he crawled in with me...

11:14.369 --> 11:17.198
asking to call Daddy.

11:19.243 --> 11:20.680
- Poor thing.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.420
- Can Marcus have a juice box?

11:22.464 --> 11:24.509
- Papi, we've got our own
in the car.

11:24.553 --> 11:25.772
- Don't be silly.

11:25.815 --> 11:26.903
Hey, you want
some animal crackers too?

11:26.947 --> 11:28.426
- What do we say
to Jane's mommy?

11:28.470 --> 11:31.386
- Thank you, Mrs. Boland.
- You're welcome.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.998
- You're too good to him.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.527
- No kid should be
without his Daddy.

11:48.142 --> 11:51.319
- ♪ Just a perfect day

11:53.887 --> 11:56.716

12:35.276 --> 12:38.148
- It's one of those tank
killers, right?

12:38.192 --> 12:40.716
You know it could land
even if it's missing a wing?

12:40.760 --> 12:42.936
Here you go.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.765
- I just think it looks dope.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.471
- Think about what you want?

12:58.516 --> 12:59.779
- Pistons.

12:59.822 --> 13:02.564
Season tickets, courtside.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.870
- So every fool you've put away

13:03.913 --> 13:05.306
can see you up there
on the jumbotron?

13:05.349 --> 13:07.090
You wouldn't make it
to halftime.

13:10.485 --> 13:12.792
- White sand beach.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.620
Warm blue water.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.232
Couple beers and a chair.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.061
- The farther the better.
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.586
One last thing popped up.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.613
- Mom, your friend's here.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.968
- Hey you.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.318
- Hey...you.

14:01.362 --> 14:06.933
- Yeah, so I was in your hood
and thought I'd say what's up.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.111
What's up?

14:11.154 --> 14:14.679
Yeah, uh, sorry.
Do we know each other?

14:14.723 --> 14:16.420
- Uh.

14:17.204 --> 14:21.164
Yeah, you crashed
into my car on the freeway,

14:21.208 --> 14:26.039
and then we pulled over and--
uh, exchanged information.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.694
You know, in the back seat.

14:29.738 --> 14:30.870
- Chris!
- Kevin.

14:30.913 --> 14:33.089
- I'm out.
- Uh--love you.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.396
Text me from Dad's.

14:35.439 --> 14:39.313
Hey, guy, there's a statute
of limitations on booty calls.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.185
- You said,
"Let's do this again sometime."

14:42.229 --> 14:46.668
- Well, still I--I don't do
that kind of thing anymore.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.757
- Ah.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.411
Okay, uh--

14:50.454 --> 14:55.111
Would it be cool if I did
my own thing, and you watched?

14:59.115 --> 15:02.118
- Daddy!
- What's up, Li'l Money!

15:02.162 --> 15:04.425
Sup, buddy.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.471
Ah, what's up, dude?

15:07.515 --> 15:09.734
- Ooh, you smell
like Sweet Tarts.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.345
- It's a hazard of the job.

15:11.388 --> 15:13.825
- Did you see
the president today?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.131
- He doesn't guard
the president.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.046
He guards the mayor.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.482
- Does he like candy?

15:18.526 --> 15:20.441
- They all do, son,
they all do.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.444
Sup, baby.
- What happened to your face?

15:23.487 --> 15:24.967
- Oh, um, somebody

15:25.011 --> 15:28.928
got a little handsy
with the mayor.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.756
All right.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.629
- Here.
- Hey.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.196
- They make me gag.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.285
- You have no idea
what we're doing to get those.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.591
- Yeah, baby.
Bottoms up.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.420
- She could be
an undercover cop.

15:43.464 --> 15:45.814
- She is not a cop.
- You don't know that.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.685
She could be wearing a wire.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.687
- She doesn't even know
what we're gonna say.

15:49.731 --> 15:51.080
- You don't know that.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.517
- She just works
at a paper store, okay?

15:53.561 --> 15:56.738
- Noah "just" worked
at a grocery store.

15:56.781 --> 15:59.436
- She has birds.
- How many?

15:59.480 --> 16:02.918
- More than one.
- Great, so she's a nutcase.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.138
- Or worse.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.878
What if she's a Mary Pat.

16:06.922 --> 16:09.490
- Well, we're not gonna
tell her what we're doing.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.144
- We didn't tell
Mary Pat either.

16:11.187 --> 16:12.623
- You guys,
we don't have to do this, okay?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.277
I talked to the dork
at the Apple Store,

16:14.321 --> 16:15.757
and I can fix
the design issues.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.368
- I haven't paid my mortgage
in four months.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.283
- And Stan's gonna have
to get on that pole.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.372
- I just need a little bit more
time, and I can fi--

16:22.416 --> 16:25.549
- You're not an artist.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.986
None of us are.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.857
She has a masters
in graphic design.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.468
I could do that.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.297
- After you graduate
from high school?

16:34.341 --> 16:37.083
And apply to college?

16:37.126 --> 16:40.390
- And attend college?
- It's a vocation, okay?

16:40.434 --> 16:43.350
- You guys,
you're gonna like her.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.135
She's cool.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.624
- Looks like
the gang's all here.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.150
- So, we wanted to talk to you

17:01.194 --> 17:03.283
about doing some
custom work for us.

17:03.326 --> 17:04.980
- What's the project?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.200
- Casino night.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.463
- For what?
- Just a local charity.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.596
- What charity?
- Gambling addicts.

17:14.076 --> 17:18.385
- You want to do a casino
night for gambling addicts?

17:19.255 --> 17:21.431
- Hair of the dog.

17:21.475 --> 17:22.867
- Anyway.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.609
We need you to design the money
that we'll bet with.

17:25.653 --> 17:29.483
I was thinking something
simple, like tens.

17:31.746 --> 17:34.749
- Look, I'm really good
at what I do, and...

17:34.792 --> 17:38.405
if it got into the wrong hands,
you know, it's kind of like...

17:39.232 --> 17:41.147
counterfeit.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.280
- Oh, you guys.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.847
- I never even thought
about that.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.109
Wow.
- Huh.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.372
- That did not even
occur to me.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.721
- Oh, what if
we put on the bill:

17:50.765 --> 17:52.636
"There's more to life
than gambling."

17:54.769 --> 17:56.553
- They just...

17:56.597 --> 17:58.555
wanna be treated like people.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.036
They don't really wanna
be judged.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.821
- Oh, we could put, um, one of
those old time croupiers

18:03.865 --> 18:05.823
with the wax mustache
and armband on it.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.783
- I think we're just gonna
stick with the president.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.221
- Hamilton wasn't a president.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.485
- He was, actually.
- No, he wasn't, actually.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.271
- They all were, you know,
like Franklin and--

18:18.314 --> 18:20.055
- Also not a president.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.537
- Jesus, any presidents
make it onto our currency?

18:23.580 --> 18:26.496
- Washington, Lincoln,
Jefferson--

18:26.540 --> 18:27.758
- Okay.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.195
- What if...

18:29.238 --> 18:32.720
We print it all
on different colored paper.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.422
- Then I'm good.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.555
- Great!
Great.

18:41.598 --> 18:42.947
Okay.

18:42.991 --> 18:45.472
Uh, hey, thank you though
for that, uh, heads up.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.387
- Criminals.
Can you even?

18:47.430 --> 18:50.216

21:08.919 --> 21:10.965
- I'm so sorry.
I had to dig.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.967
Danny hid it in the back
of the closet.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.056
- He's probably scared
you're gonna sign him back up.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.753
- Right?

21:16.797 --> 21:20.322
- Uh, by the way, you never
told me Coach Freddy was hot.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.020
- Oh, you think we're watching
our kids at those games?

21:24.805 --> 21:27.590
Man, thanks again
for working your magic.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.853
- I wish I could do more.

21:29.897 --> 21:32.073
- His Daddy's
gonna be proud too.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.120
- What do you mean?

21:36.164 --> 21:39.080
- Well, if he shows his face
before the season's over.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.257
- I thought you said
he was gone.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.260
- Well, then he'll pop back up
like he always does.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.610
And the poor kid won't know
what hit him.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.743
That's probably why
it didn't work out for us.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.571
- I'm so sorry.
- Will you stop?

21:51.614 --> 21:53.355
We're fine.

21:53.399 --> 21:54.922
- I think I have cleats too.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.489
- Oh, hell no.
- What size is he?

21:56.532 --> 21:58.229
- I'm not gonna tell you.

22:01.624 --> 22:02.669
- Why are you blocking
the door?

22:02.712 --> 22:03.931
- Move, move.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.628
- I can't keep this
in my trunk.

22:05.672 --> 22:08.283
- Mine doesn't even open, so.
- My car almost got towed.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.112
Hey.
- Yo.

22:11.155 --> 22:14.245
- This is my--
- I'm Rhea.

22:16.596 --> 22:19.599
- Mrs. Boland,
I made this for you.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.210
- Thank you.

22:22.253 --> 22:25.126
I murdered the kid's dad,
all right?

22:28.390 --> 22:31.088
The least I could do...

22:31.132 --> 22:33.308
is get him
into intramural sports.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.615
- You plunged into
the way deep end of the pool

22:35.658 --> 22:36.920
on this one, sis.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.487
- It's not gonna
bring him back.

22:38.531 --> 22:41.011
- I don't wanna bring him back.
- Then what's the point?

22:41.055 --> 22:43.405
- Maybe I can make their lives
a little bit better.

22:43.449 --> 22:46.626
- By lying?
- By helping.

22:46.669 --> 22:50.020
- You know how you help the
family of the guy you ended?

22:50.064 --> 22:53.720
- Yeah, you get a teardrop
tattoo and you call it a day.

22:53.763 --> 22:56.113
- You do nothing.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.767
- You guys don't know
what it's like, okay?

22:57.811 --> 23:00.074
- Hey, I shot a guy too.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.597
- I mean...

23:01.641 --> 23:03.120
in the foot.

23:03.947 --> 23:07.211
I'm just saying,
kid lost a father.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.865
Your guy lost a toe.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.695
Okay, you know what, don't
lose your chicken over it.

23:13.522 --> 23:16.046
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.439
- I literally don't know
what that means.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.789
- Exactly what it sounds like.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.443
It's like "having a cow,"
ya know?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.053
- Then say "having a cow."

23:23.097 --> 23:24.620
- Well, a cow is like
totally chill,

23:24.664 --> 23:25.969
so you're not gonna
just lose it

23:26.013 --> 23:27.362
'cause it's
just gonna stand there,

23:27.406 --> 23:29.233
and a chicken is like
running around crazy,

23:29.277 --> 23:30.409
know what I'm saying?

23:30.452 --> 23:31.627
- No, I don't know
what you're saying.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.412
- Well, that's your problem.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.680
- She's so weird.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.827
- Oh, uh, we're closing.
- I just need a card.

23:59.699 --> 24:02.005
- I got it.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.664
What's the occasion?

24:08.708 --> 24:10.927
- Thinking of you.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.712
- Right this way.

24:14.191 --> 24:16.411
How ya been?
- Busy.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.022
- Why don't you take
that vacation?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.720
- Well, that's the thing
about this gig.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.723
Just when you think you're
finished something new pops up.

24:25.855 --> 24:30.381
- There's funny,
religious, dirty.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.036
- Still part time?

24:34.342 --> 24:36.910
- I had to take on
a few more hours.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.870
- It's not easy making
an honest living.

24:42.089 --> 24:45.527
You know, maybe a card's
not enough.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.398
- We have gag gifts up front.

24:47.442 --> 24:50.097
- Nah, I think I just need
to make an effort, you know?

24:50.140 --> 24:52.229
Drop in on people more often.

24:52.273 --> 24:55.929
- Tiny hands, rosé gummies--
- I think he's good.

24:55.972 --> 24:59.280
- The travel straw?
- All set, Lucy.

25:03.589 --> 25:06.069
- Be good, okay?

25:12.772 --> 25:15.252
- I hate a pop-by.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.428
- It's always when
I take my face off.

25:17.472 --> 25:20.910
- The worst part is you never
know when they're gonna leave.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.913
- Or come back.

25:25.436 --> 25:28.091
- Maybe the man
just needed a greeting card.

25:38.362 --> 25:40.321
- Throw it on.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.989
- Mortgage.

25:58.382 --> 25:59.949
Credit card.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.913
Hopes and dreams.

26:23.494 --> 26:26.019
- That breakfast?
- Appetizer.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.717
- Wash it down with some juice,
would you?

26:29.979 --> 26:31.459
- Who was that guy?

26:33.113 --> 26:35.158
- Nobody.
Chris.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.508
- Kevin.
- Whatever.

26:37.552 --> 26:40.294
- Is he like your new Noah?

26:40.337 --> 26:41.643
- No.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.950
- Good, 'cause that
whole thing kinda sucked.

26:43.993 --> 26:47.388
- Yeah, well,
no more Noahs, okay?

26:47.431 --> 26:51.000
No more Chrises or Kevins.

26:51.044 --> 26:54.395
No more Brad, Brians,
no Diegos--

26:54.438 --> 26:57.311
- Gregs?
- Definitely no Gregs.

26:57.354 --> 26:59.052
I am done with Gregs.

26:59.095 --> 27:02.621
- You know, you change
the name, they're all the same.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.797
- Okay.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.321
- They mess with your head,
and then they ghost.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.497
I mean, who needs it?
- Not you.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.368
- Not me.
Have some bread.

27:11.847 --> 27:14.981
You know why?
I am a fierce, independent,

27:15.024 --> 27:17.200
super fly, bossed up,

27:17.244 --> 27:19.855
weapons grade--
- Llama.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.379
- Wait what?

27:22.423 --> 27:25.034
- The ones at the zoo
that eat from your hand.

27:25.948 --> 27:26.993
- The fuzzy camels?

27:27.036 --> 27:28.864
- Remember I was like,
"They love me,"

27:28.908 --> 27:31.040
and you were like, "Nah, that's
just 'cause you have kibble.

27:31.084 --> 27:34.435
They come up to anyone."
- Yeah, but how's that me?

27:34.478 --> 27:36.306
- It's just like you were
saying, it's like,

27:36.350 --> 27:37.786
anyone who shows you
a little affection,

27:37.830 --> 27:40.528
next thing you know you're
being shaved for a sweater.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.968
- That is not exactly...

27:46.012 --> 27:47.709
what I was saying.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.146
- Wanna make mac and cheese
for breakfast?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.976
- Just do it.
Don't think about it.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.586
- Can I get it?

27:55.630 --> 27:57.719
- Look before you open.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.811
- I'm seriously gonna barf.
- Stop.

28:02.855 --> 28:06.206
- Hi, you must be
Stan's little guy.

28:06.249 --> 28:08.382
Hey.
Hey, Ruthie.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.949
- Ruby.
- Oh.

28:09.992 --> 28:14.083
As long as we're doing names,
I'm actually Diane.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.346
Is Stan home?

28:16.390 --> 28:18.740
- No, he's, uh--
running errands.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.743
- Oh, okay, I just wanted to
say thanks for having my back

28:21.787 --> 28:23.049
in the champagne room.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.833
There's all sorts of goodies
in there,

28:24.877 --> 28:27.401
and lots of little treats
for the kids too.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.751
- What's a champagne room?

28:29.795 --> 28:32.406
- Uh, that's where
the mayor celebrates.

28:32.449 --> 28:35.409
- Mayor, athletes, cops, dads.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.889
- Uh-huh, yeah, um.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.412
Can you take him
to the kitchen, please?

28:38.455 --> 28:41.632
- Come on.
- And take your pill.

28:42.503 --> 28:43.852
- They make me choke.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.854
- Oh, you know what that is,
honey?

28:45.898 --> 28:48.901
That's your gag reflex,
and you can totally fix that.

28:48.944 --> 28:51.599
You just want to completely
relax the "fur-angul" muscle,

28:51.642 --> 28:54.080
right here under the jaw.
- Pharyngeal.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.646
- You feel it?

28:55.690 --> 28:57.648
Then you wanna open up
your throat really wide,

28:57.692 --> 29:01.740
and stick the pill,
on the back of your tongue.

29:02.653 --> 29:05.656
You won't even feel
that sucker go down.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.616
Now, it's gonna take some
practice, for sure,

29:08.659 --> 29:10.270
and at first,
it's gonna feel like

29:10.313 --> 29:13.012
that thing is jammed way too
far back in your mouth,

29:13.055 --> 29:16.798
but if you just close
your eyes, let it happen,

29:16.842 --> 29:20.323
before you know it, girl,
you can swallow anything.

29:20.367 --> 29:24.327
- Then take your ass to Red
Lobster and bring her back.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.809
- She's just not answering,
Mrs. Hill, if you'd like to--

29:27.853 --> 29:29.506
- I'm not talking
to anybody else.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.639
Gwen already knows
my daughter's situation.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.162
- Please hold.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.602
- Hi, Ruby.
- How was the popcorn shrimp?

29:38.646 --> 29:40.604
- I get the admiral's platter.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.998
- You know that's not why
I'm calling, Gwen.

29:44.695 --> 29:48.003
- Your appeal was denied,
so...

29:51.006 --> 29:53.400
We'll only cover
the medicine

29:53.443 --> 29:55.315
in case of an emergency.

29:55.358 --> 29:58.753
- She takes the meds
to prevent an emergency.

29:59.536 --> 30:02.757
What am I supposed to do, call
you when her kidney explodes?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.585
- I understand
your frustration.

30:04.628 --> 30:07.327
- Oh, you do?
So, you have a sick kid too.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.678
And your husband works
a disgusting, humiliating job

30:10.721 --> 30:13.637
that demeans you
as a woman and a mother.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.204
All to pay for something that

30:15.248 --> 30:18.381
anybody on planet Earth
would expect to be covered.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.297
- I've never been married.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.170
- 'Kay, this is how
it's gonna go down, Gwen.

30:24.213 --> 30:27.129
You're gonna appeal my appeal,
and if that doesn't work,

30:27.173 --> 30:28.957
you're gonna appeal
that appeal.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.611
And when we're done appealing--

30:30.654 --> 30:33.614
- They're shutting down
our division.

30:33.657 --> 30:35.050
- What does that mean?

30:35.094 --> 30:38.793
- My department's going
to Sri Lanka.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.709
- That's a big commute, Gwen.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.843
My last day is Friday.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.020
- Yeesh, that's quick.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.892
- Yeah.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.416
- What are you gonna do?

30:53.460 --> 30:55.766
- I'm gonna move back home.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.204
- At least you have family.

30:58.247 --> 31:01.207
- Yeah, it'll be tight.
My grandma's there too.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.471
- Grannies make
everything better.

31:04.514 --> 31:05.994
- She's in my old room.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.605
I'll probably just
sleep on the floor.

31:09.258 --> 31:12.218
- Well, they say
it's really good for you back.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.784
- Yeah?

31:13.828 --> 31:16.222
It's never been the same
since the accident.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.093
- Okay, you kn--uh.

31:18.137 --> 31:21.227
- I'm rooting for you, G.
- Thank you.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.316
- Yeah, you're gonna
get through this.

31:23.359 --> 31:25.579
- I'll make sure the folks in
Sri Lanka know about your da--

31:25.622 --> 31:27.233
- All right.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.279
- I already told you three.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.761
- Please!
- Are we gonna have to move?

31:34.805 --> 31:37.765
Can we paint our room purple?

31:41.464 --> 31:43.118
- I'll ask Daddy.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.773
Night.

31:45.816 --> 31:46.861
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, mama.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.384
- They were a gift.

31:48.428 --> 31:51.431
- They don't fit.
- Well, he'll grow into them.

31:51.474 --> 31:54.434
- I'm gonna have to dedicate
a wing of my house to you.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.566
- You don't have a wing.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.787
- Fine, a statue?
A plaque?

31:59.830 --> 32:01.745
- So weird.

32:01.789 --> 32:04.574
I don't want any
of your stuff, okay?

32:04.618 --> 32:06.446
I just want a friend.

32:06.489 --> 32:08.796
- Well, it's either you
or the county sheriff.

32:08.839 --> 32:11.016
- What are you talking about?

32:12.669 --> 32:14.976
- Nothing.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.457
Nothing.
We're downsizing.

32:17.500 --> 32:18.980
- By choice?

32:19.024 --> 32:20.721
- Do you want some more wine?

32:20.764 --> 32:22.766
- What's going on?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.943
- We're just a little behind
on our mortgage.

32:25.726 --> 32:28.207
Stop.
I'll be fine.

32:28.250 --> 32:32.776
- I'm sorry, it's just--
all this time,

32:32.820 --> 32:35.127
I thought you were
so put together and perfect,

32:35.170 --> 32:36.998
- Oh, believe me--
- And you think I'm this poor,

32:37.042 --> 32:39.392
sad, single mom.
- I do not.

32:39.435 --> 32:40.828
I would never.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.352
- Now, you get to see
how it feels.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.009
- How much?

32:48.749 --> 32:50.229
- What?

32:50.272 --> 32:52.361
- You can pay me back.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.147
- Absolutely not.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.888
- Marcus' dad, he sets us up.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.849
- What if he doesn't come back?

33:02.415 --> 33:04.025
- Then he'll send the money.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.772
- I'm not taking your money.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.907
- How much?

33:46.807 --> 33:50.941
- Unfortunately, sometimes
I can't bottle my emotions.

33:50.985 --> 33:54.510
And when it comes to someone
I can trust, I do, I open up.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.643
- Hey, baby.

33:56.686 --> 33:58.427
- Hey.

33:58.471 --> 34:01.039
Stanimal.

34:02.997 --> 34:05.043
Uh.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.784
That better not be
the new season.

34:07.828 --> 34:10.091
- It certainly is.

34:10.657 --> 34:12.920
- What episode?

34:12.963 --> 34:14.922
- Four.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.490
- Wow.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.622
You just gonna
go around my back like that?

34:19.666 --> 34:22.364
- You're gone all night.

34:22.408 --> 34:26.238
- Okay.
All right, I see.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.559
- There's a new crew
this season.

34:44.256 --> 34:47.563
-  You want me
to quit, I'll quit.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.524
- And do what?
Porn?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.395
What else pays that kinda cash?

34:53.439 --> 34:55.484
- Well, clearly you have
a problem with it.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.709
- Everyone's got problems
they have to live with.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.103
Not just me.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.323
- Hm.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.633
Wh--

35:13.676 --> 35:16.549
What's, uh, Hannah's
baggage this season?

35:18.203 --> 35:21.597
- She's down a stew.
- Don't tell me that.

35:21.641 --> 35:24.383
- You just asked, and
you know it's always something.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.733
- Ah, nope, nope,
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.387
Be tellin' me stuff.

35:28.430 --> 35:33.131
You remember the last time,
Conrad, he--he got all crazy.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.701
- South Dakota originated
a dish called chislic.

35:38.745 --> 35:40.399
- Hard work is easy.
Helping p--

35:40.442 --> 35:42.009
- The thing about--
- Just fill the resev--

35:42.052 --> 35:43.750
- That's why--
- Whether you're expecting

35:43.793 --> 35:45.578
out-of-town guests,
or just a drop-by

37:24.590 --> 37:26.722
- Ah!

37:35.296 --> 37:37.080
I'm gonna ask you guys
something,

37:37.124 --> 37:40.345
and I want you
to be honest.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.781
Remember last winter
when we saw

37:41.824 --> 37:45.306
that Celica slam
into the pickup truck on I94?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.743
- Uh-huh.

37:47.787 --> 37:51.660
- And the minivan couldn't stop
and smashed into the Celica?

37:51.704 --> 37:53.183
- Right.

37:53.227 --> 37:56.056
- And the semi went sideways,
took out the SUV,

37:56.099 --> 37:59.407
crashed into all of 'em,
and caught on fire.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.020
Is that my life?

38:09.417 --> 38:11.854
- Which vehicle are you
in this scenario?

38:11.898 --> 38:13.247
- Hey.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.946
Whoa.
Purple.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.385
- If we have to sell the house,

38:20.428 --> 38:21.734
I don't know if purple
is the best idea.

38:21.777 --> 38:24.606
- Dean, I paid it.
- Wait, all of it?

38:24.650 --> 38:26.347
- No, the interest
and the penalties.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.654
- How'd you do that?
- A friend.

38:28.697 --> 38:32.397
- Okay, can we not use
the phrase "a friend" anymore.

38:32.440 --> 38:35.225
- Not that friend, you know,
like a mom friend.

38:35.269 --> 38:37.837
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, obviously.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.708
Sorry, that was
the trigger, it--

38:39.752 --> 38:42.450
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- All right.

38:42.494 --> 38:45.497
- Remember Kenny's video game
with the Nazi zombies?

38:46.889 --> 38:48.761
- He's dead.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.285
- Right, but what if
he reanimates?

38:52.808 --> 38:54.419
I don't know,
I think we could take him

38:54.462 --> 38:56.203
'cause I'm guessing
he's mostly skull.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.945
- He's a skull and tats.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.008
- So it looks like
your room and incidentals

39:19.052 --> 39:21.881
are all covered.
- Awesome, thank you, Angela.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.752
How am I doing
on loyalty points?

39:23.796 --> 39:26.581
- After this day,
you are officially gold status.

39:26.625 --> 39:29.236
Congratulations.
- Neat.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.333

39:42.423 --> 39:43.903
business.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.600
- Well, we hope to see you
again soon, Mr. Kowalski.

39:45.644 --> 39:46.993
- You too.
Thank you, Angela.

39:47.036 --> 39:48.168
