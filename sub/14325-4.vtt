19:46.852 --> 19:47.352
MY HEDGES!

19:47.436 --> 19:50.063
CURSE YOU,
DINKLEBERG.

19:50.147 --> 19:54.026
HA! TAKE THAT,
DINKLEBERG.

[POUNDING]

19:56.153 --> 19:57.779
MAN, AM I GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.197
I WISH THE HEDGES
WERE FIXED.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.074
WHEN DO I GET TO HAVE ANY FUN?

20:01.158 --> 20:03.619
Dad: COME BACK HERE,
DINKLEBERG.

20:06.705 --> 20:07.789
HEY! WHAT--WHOA!

20:07.873 --> 20:11.919
{\an4}MAN, I JUST CAN'T
GET THE HANG OF
THIS FAIRY BUSINESS.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.795
I NEED TRAINING.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.255
{\an1}THAT'S IT.
I'LL GO TO FAIRY WORLD

20:15.339 --> 20:20.469
{\an1}AND LEARN HOW TO BE A BETTER
FAIRY THAN COSMO OR WANDA.

20:20.552 --> 20:21.678
FAIRY WORLD?

20:21.762 --> 20:22.638
SCARY WORLD.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.639
YOU'RE NOT THAT SCARY.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.306
YEAH? WELL,
HERE'S A PHOTO

20:24.389 --> 20:26.266
OF YOUR
GRANDMA'S FEET.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.102
[SCREAMS] IT BURNS.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.647
FAIRY WORLD?

20:31.730 --> 20:32.731
HAIRY WORLD.

20:32.814 --> 20:33.899
{\an1}[MOOING]

20:33.982 --> 20:35.233
DAIRY WORLD?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.485
HAIRY WORLD.

20:36.568 --> 20:37.986
OH, DARN IT.

20:40.739 --> 20:41.740
FAIRY WORLD!

20:41.823 --> 20:43.241
I DID IT.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.910
YOU FAIRY WITH
SILLY, PINK HAT.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.746
YOU MUST DO
WAND-UPS--NOW!

20:47.829 --> 20:48.455
1, 2, 3...

20:48.538 --> 20:50.082
Wanda: OH, WOW.
THIS REEKS.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.000
WHERE'S OUR
FAIRY GODPARENT?

20:52.084 --> 20:53.293
{\an1}WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

20:53.377 --> 20:58.590
{\an1}AS LONG AS VICKY'S AROUND,
WE CAN'T MAKE WISHES.

20:58.674 --> 21:03.220
WOW! IT'S SO CLEAN,
I CAN SEE MYSELF.

21:03.303 --> 21:04.304
AND NOW I CAN'T.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.516
{\an5}GOOD THING
THE GARBAGE
DISPOSAL'S BUSTED.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.852
START SHOVELING!

21:10.936 --> 21:11.561
I'LL BE BUSY
SLEEPING.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.522
SHE'S WORSE
THAN JORGEN.

21:13.605 --> 21:17.150
Timmy: AND HOW DOES THIS HELP
ME IN BEING A FAIRY GODPARENT?

21:17.234 --> 21:18.652
TO HONE THE MAGIC
REFLEXES.

21:18.735 --> 21:22.406
{\an5}A NEEDY CHILD COULD
WISH FOR ANYTHING AT
ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

21:22.489 --> 21:24.783
YOU MUST BE READY.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.871
BIG DEAL. I CAN FLY.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.249
[SCREAMING]

21:32.332 --> 21:35.002
{\an5}SAVE YOURSELF,
NEW FAIRY.
THINK FAST.

21:35.085 --> 21:38.463
I--I--WAIT, THAT'S IT.

21:46.722 --> 21:49.182
{\an1}THIS FAIRY STUFF
IS HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.726
{\an1}AND I'M SICK
OF THESE THINGS.

21:50.809 --> 21:53.395
{\an5}IF YOU DON'T LIKE
IT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GO BACK TO BEING

21:53.478 --> 21:55.230
A PUNY, LITTLE
HUMAN BOY.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.357
{\an1}YEAH. I'M NOT MUCH
OF A GODPARENT.

21:57.441 --> 22:01.653
{\an1}BUT BEING A KID IS ONE THING
I KNOW I'M REALLY GOOD AT.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.447
BUT BEFORE I GO...

22:05.323 --> 22:06.742
[MOO]

22:06.825 --> 22:09.411
Jorgen: OOF.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.454
DAIRY WORLD?

22:10.537 --> 22:10.871
FAIRY WORLD.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.081
OH, DARN IT.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.254
[LAUGHING]

22:19.337 --> 22:23.133
{\an5}I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU
HAVE JUST AS MUCH JUNK
TO DEAL WITH AS I DO.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.718
JORGEN'S A CREEP.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.138
YEAH, WELL, VICKY AIN'T EXACTLY
A TRIP TO CHERRY WORLD EITHER.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.933
{\an5}AH! OOH! CHERRY WORLD!
CHERRY WORLD!
CAN WE GO THERE.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.519
I WISH HE HAD A MUZZLE.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.229
PUZZLE? CLOSE ENOUGH.

22:36.313 --> 22:39.357
I THOUGHT BEING
A FAIRY WOULD BE FUN.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.276
BUT I LEARNED IT'S
MORE FUN TO BE A KID,

22:41.359 --> 22:43.111
BECAUSE I HAVE YOU GUYS
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.032
SO, UH, I'M, UH...

22:47.115 --> 22:48.658
APOLOGY ACCEPTED, SPORT.

22:48.742 --> 22:53.705
{\an4}WE WISH YOU WERE
A KID AGAIN, AND WE WISH
WE WERE FAIRIES AGAIN.

Dad: AH, FINALLY.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.763
{\an5}I CAN USE
THIS FOR MY
MILK-POWERED ENGINE.

23:09.846 --> 23:10.180
MOO?

23:10.263 --> 23:11.264
[THUMP THUMP]

23:11.348 --> 23:15.644

I'M JUST A KID.
