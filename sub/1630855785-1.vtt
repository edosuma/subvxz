(dramatic music)

00:15.807 --> 00:18.435
(upbeat music)

00:46.671 --> 00:52.260
(airplane engine humming)
(upbeat music continues)

02:28.314 --> 02:33.319
(crickets chirping)
(footsteps echoing)

02:37.574 --> 02:40.285
(door slamming)

02:42.162 --> 02:44.789
Er, what is this is place?

02:44.831 --> 02:45.874
It's all yours?

02:47.250 --> 02:49.210
The entire property?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.219
(clothes rustling)

02:58.261 --> 03:02.390
(jacket lightly thuds on floor)

03:03.725 --> 03:04.392
Your money

03:05.560 --> 03:06.686
(shirt lightly thuds on floor)

03:06.728 --> 03:07.687
and your power

03:08.980 --> 03:11.232
is such a fucking turn on.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.445
Not in here.

03:16.905 --> 03:17.906
In there?

03:30.585 --> 03:32.128
(door creaking)

03:32.170 --> 03:34.673
(tense music)

03:54.567 --> 03:57.654
- [Donald] I know
what you're thinking.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.155
What is this?

03:59.197 --> 04:02.409
(Donald chuckles)

04:02.450 --> 04:03.868
(door creaking)

04:03.910 --> 04:05.412
Let me show you.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.790
This is where life becomes art.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.712
(tense music continues)

04:44.951 --> 04:45.869
(Paislee laughing)

04:45.910 --> 04:47.704
(Paislee grunting)

04:47.746 --> 04:51.166
- Okay, I dunno
what you think is,

04:51.207 --> 04:53.460
or who you believe me to be,

04:53.501 --> 04:56.921
but I am not someone you
want to be throwing around.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.423
My family has money.

04:59.674 --> 05:04.679
(Janelle thudding on glass)
(Janelle screaming)

05:06.848 --> 05:09.142
If you die, I die.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.268
What?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.269
(hand smacking glass wall)

05:11.311 --> 05:12.103
Run!

05:18.026 --> 05:19.861
(muffled screaming)

05:19.903 --> 05:22.530
(Paislee screaming)

05:22.572 --> 05:23.156
No!

05:23.198 --> 05:23.990
Stop!

05:24.032 --> 05:24.866
Stop!

05:28.370 --> 05:31.790
(Paislee sobbing)

05:31.831 --> 05:32.457
Run!

05:34.918 --> 05:35.835
Run!

05:37.212 --> 05:40.090
(Janelle panting)

05:42.133 --> 05:44.886
(ominous music)

05:47.097 --> 05:49.974
(Paislee screaming)

05:51.976 --> 05:55.188
(screaming) No!

05:55.230 --> 05:58.441
(muffled screaming)

06:05.699 --> 06:06.408
No!

06:10.161 --> 06:12.539
(fist thudding on Paislee)

06:12.580 --> 06:15.709
(fist thudding on Paislee)

06:15.750 --> 06:18.211
(footstep thudding on Paislee)

06:18.253 --> 06:21.756
(ominous music continues)

06:24.300 --> 06:27.012
(door creaking)

06:57.125 --> 07:00.462
Stop, no! (screaming)

07:15.685 --> 07:20.065
Let me out.
(Janelle banging on walls)

07:20.106 --> 07:20.940
No, no!

07:25.528 --> 07:28.782
(Paislee whimpering)

07:28.823 --> 07:31.493
(ominous music)

07:38.750 --> 07:39.709
[Janelle] No! (screaming)

07:39.751 --> 07:42.712
(knife slashing into flesh)

07:42.754 --> 07:47.759
(Donald groaning)
(Janelle crying)

07:48.885 --> 07:50.220
- [Janelle] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.388
Please don't kill me.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.098
Please don't kill me.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.642
(dramatic music)

08:07.696 --> 08:10.907
(door latch clanking)

08:14.869 --> 08:16.246
No!

08:16.287 --> 08:17.997
No, don't come in here!

08:21.084 --> 08:24.004
(lock clanking)

08:24.045 --> 08:25.547
(door creaking)

08:25.588 --> 08:26.506
No, I'm sorry.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.133
I'm sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.342
I'm sorry, please don't kill me.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.636
- Please don't kill me.
- Shh!

08:33.430 --> 08:36.016
You are in the
middle of nowhere,

08:36.057 --> 08:40.061
so you can keep running,
you can keep screaming,

08:41.146 --> 08:44.566
you can keep shouting,
you can keep crying.

08:45.692 --> 08:49.612
You can keep trying to
escape the inescapable.

08:50.822 --> 08:51.740
Go on.

08:54.200 --> 08:59.414
And I will keep stabbing you
and missing my mark every time

08:59.456 --> 09:02.375
until your entire
mid-section is open.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.711
You will be in so much pain.

09:05.837 --> 09:09.215
So much you will beg
for me to kill you.

09:13.053 --> 09:17.682
Or you can just be still and
this will be over in a second.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.685
(dramatic music continues)

09:20.727 --> 09:23.104
(Janelle crying)

09:23.146 --> 09:23.772
Shh.

09:25.774 --> 09:30.612
(Janelle groaning in agony)
(knife slashing into skin)

09:31.780 --> 09:36.826
(Donald groans)
(knife squelching)

09:38.661 --> 09:43.583
- Yeah
(Janelle groaning in agony)

09:43.625 --> 09:48.421
(Donald sighing and laughing)

09:48.463 --> 09:51.132
(knife shanks out)

10:00.767 --> 10:03.812
(Blood spluttering)

10:21.496 --> 10:26.376
(sad music)
(crickets chirping)

10:35.176 --> 10:37.846
(feet echoing)

10:41.516 --> 10:44.853
(door clanks and creaks)

10:48.648 --> 10:50.150
[Blessing] Thanks for coming.

10:50.191 --> 10:51.192
No problem.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.069
[Blessing] Oh, come here.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.696
You be safe, okay?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.324
You text me when you
all get home then.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.034
Will do

11:00.410 --> 11:03.246
(Blessing sighing)

11:04.706 --> 11:05.582
(fridge door slamming)

11:05.623 --> 11:06.458
Hey

11:07.709 --> 11:08.710
You okay?

11:09.753 --> 11:11.504
I'm fine.

11:11.546 --> 11:12.881
I was worried.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.177
I'm fine.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.345
You are not fine.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.429
You haven't slept in weeks.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.805
You need rest.

11:25.727 --> 11:30.482
(dogs barking)
(feet rustling in grass)

11:30.523 --> 11:33.485
(helicopter whirring)

11:35.236 --> 11:36.529
(emergency vehicle
siren wailing)

11:36.571 --> 11:37.739
All right, spread out and see

11:37.781 --> 11:40.408
if there is another
victim out here.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.705
Oh my god!
(dogs continue barking)

11:45.747 --> 11:47.374
(door clicking)

11:47.415 --> 11:50.835
(light switch clicking)

11:53.713 --> 11:56.508
(drawer rattling)

12:04.182 --> 12:05.725
- Look, I know you're not
trying to hear this right now,

12:05.767 --> 12:07.018
but I love you,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.771
and I'm here for you.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.440
Whatever you need.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.613
I am not rejecting your love.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.989
I'm just sweaty.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.868
(cellphone ringing)

12:27.789 --> 12:30.458
(John sighing)

12:32.419 --> 12:33.920
You can answer the phone, John.

12:33.962 --> 12:34.921
They're probably calling
you about that serial killer

12:34.963 --> 12:37.090
we've been hearing about.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.258
Mm mm.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.342
Nope.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.594
I'm here for you and for mom

12:41.636 --> 12:43.471
not to help on some
high profile case.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.307
(sighing) It's okay, babe.

12:46.349 --> 12:49.144
You're not abandoning
me if you leave.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.479
You're an ...
(phone ringing)

12:51.521 --> 12:55.734
You're an important man
with an important job, okay?

12:55.775 --> 12:56.776
(lips smacking)

12:56.818 --> 12:58.028
Go be important.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.697
Are you sure?

13:00.739 --> 13:01.489
Yes.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.616
(gentle music)
(door slamming)

13:03.658 --> 13:04.451
(shower splashing)

13:04.492 --> 13:06.828
(gentle music)

13:20.300 --> 13:25.180
* I like that you're here
in my space, baby love

13:28.183 --> 13:33.271
* Love is the arc we
create, so beautiful

13:36.232 --> 13:41.321
* Hoping it's not just a phase

13:42.155 --> 13:45.492
* Cause an unspoken love

13:45.533 --> 13:47.285
* It has finally

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
(crying)

13:51.373 --> 13:53.917
* Dream lover

13:55.085 --> 13:59.964
* Dream lover
(crying)

14:04.135 --> 14:06.888
(indistinct voice over radio)
(helicopter whirring)

14:06.930 --> 14:09.057
[Man] Yeah, ETA five.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.436
(doors slamming)

14:13.478 --> 14:15.063
- [Woman] You heard
it, get back there.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.606
- [Man] You, get
back in that vehicle

14:16.648 --> 14:18.441
and move it out of here!

14:19.901 --> 14:24.531
(crickets chirping)
(helicopter roaring continues)

14:26.908 --> 14:30.412
(car door slamming shut)

14:32.414 --> 14:35.834
- [Man] Do me a favor.
Please, please help me out.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.420
(indistinct voice over radio)

14:38.461 --> 14:39.879
Iceberg.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.757
- Thank you so much
for coming out.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.675
- Commissioner Levy
it's been a long time.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.093
It has, it has.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.970
First I want to give my sincere
condolences to your wife

14:47.012 --> 14:47.971
and your family.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.222
I know this is a
very tough time.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.724
- Can we see some IDs please?
- Thank you.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.017
Why don't you follow me?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.226
I'll take you back
to the crime scene

14:53.268 --> 14:53.893
them I'm gonna show
you what happened.

14:53.935 --> 14:54.728
All right.

14:54.769 --> 14:55.937
Right this way.

14:58.606 --> 15:02.402
Earlier this morning, a
local farmer called this in,

15:02.444 --> 15:04.112
said his dogs woke him up
in the middle of the night

15:04.154 --> 15:05.405
and dragged him
out into the woods.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.282
He found two women
tied to a tree.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.867
They're gonna be right
around the corner over here.

15:08.908 --> 15:09.951
Follow me.

15:09.993 --> 15:10.952
All right.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.707
- They're both hanging
up side by side

15:15.749 --> 15:16.875
right around here.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.252
They look identical.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.755
I've never anything
like it before.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.089
Right over here.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.759
And right over there.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.593
(utensil clanking on counter)

15:26.634 --> 15:28.553
(gentle music)

15:28.595 --> 15:33.600
* Whoa

15:36.478 --> 15:38.271
* Whoa

15:39.147 --> 15:40.190
Come on up here.

15:40.231 --> 15:41.024
Iceberg.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.319
I want you to meet
Special Agent Revis.

15:44.361 --> 15:46.112
He's gonna be working
this case with you.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.783
- John Iceberg Rollins,
man, nice to meet you.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.118
I'm sorry for your
loss, by the way, man.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.163
- I specifically asked for
Iceberg's help on this case.

15:55.205 --> 15:56.623
- I'm not here to
step on any toes.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.292
- Step on toes, please, man,
I'm glad to have you here.

15:59.334 --> 16:03.171
You can step on my toes
anytime, have at it.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.591
So what are we looking for?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.259
Bruisings, swelling,

16:09.386 --> 16:11.346
anything that shows
signs of a struggle.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.223
We need to know if
these women fought

16:13.264 --> 16:14.599
or if they were drugged.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.809
Maybe even both.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.268
Mm, does it matter?

16:17.310 --> 16:21.773
- * I don't need you
- Everything matters.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.026
* I trust you fully

16:25.068 --> 16:28.613
- * Till I need you
- The body paint' still fresh.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.240
Tell your men to spread
out and search the area.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.950
Make sure whoever did
this is not watching us

16:31.991 --> 16:33.201
from the trees.

16:33.243 --> 16:34.202
* I don't need you
(Revis sighing)

16:34.244 --> 16:35.745
All right, I need four teams.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.123
I need everybody spreading out
north, south, east, and west.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.457
Let's get it.
(hands clapping)

16:39.499 --> 16:45.296
* Fully, till I need
you, need you.

16:45.338 --> 16:49.342
* I can see it, this can't be

16:49.384 --> 16:53.596
* I can't believe that
it happened to me

16:53.638 --> 16:55.432
* Thought I knew you

16:55.473 --> 16:57.976
* Thought you would be part
of my picture, (indistinct)

16:58.018 --> 17:02.731
* What you gonna do,
when you gonna choose?

17:05.692 --> 17:08.194
* You gonna gonna lose
(air whooshing)

17:08.236 --> 17:10.405
* Tell yourself the truth

17:10.447 --> 17:15.076
* You're chasing stars
off in the dark

17:16.161 --> 17:19.456
(water sploshing)

17:19.497 --> 17:23.752
* Cause you died in a lie papa

17:23.793 --> 17:27.964
* And you died in a lie baby

17:28.006 --> 17:31.468
* Cause you died in the papa

17:31.509 --> 17:37.182
* Cause you died lie papa
* See I love you truly

17:37.223 --> 17:41.019
* I don't need you

17:41.061 --> 17:44.814
* Ooh, I trust you fully

17:44.856 --> 17:48.735
* Till I need you

17:48.777 --> 17:52.822
* Oh I love you truly

17:52.864 --> 17:55.617
* I don't need you

17:57.118 --> 18:00.830
* See
* Ooh I trust you fully

18:00.872 --> 18:04.793
* till I need you

18:04.834 --> 18:09.005
* Oh I love you truly

18:09.047 --> 18:13.093
* I don't need you

18:13.134 --> 18:17.055
* Oh I trust you fully

18:17.097 --> 18:21.017
* Till I need you

18:21.059 --> 18:24.437
* Ooh I love you

18:24.479 --> 18:26.731
- Come on Blessing
answer the fucking phone.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.441
Answer the phone.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.945
(phone ringing)

18:31.986 --> 18:35.198
(cup banging on cabinet)

18:36.574 --> 18:38.910
- Don't tell me y'all
caught that guy already.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.454
I knew you were good, but wow.

18:42.664 --> 18:43.623
- [Iceberg] How's
everything going over there?

18:43.665 --> 18:45.000
Are you safe?

18:45.041 --> 18:45.709
You haven't heard anything
weird or anything like that?

18:45.750 --> 18:46.835
Are you okay.

18:46.876 --> 18:49.129
(sighing) Babe, I'm Fine.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.296
Would you relax?

18:50.338 --> 18:51.715
Why are you so edgy?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.758
- The doppelganger
killer is in the area.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.096
I need you to lock all
the doors and windows now.

18:58.138 --> 19:00.515
(phone tone)

19:02.851 --> 19:05.562
(ominous music)

19:13.069 --> 19:14.195
John.

19:15.530 --> 19:19.409
(door squeaking and slamming)

19:52.984 --> 19:56.237
(gun cocking)

19:56.279 --> 19:59.783
(ominous music continues)

20:31.022 --> 20:33.900
(Blessing screaming)

20:33.942 --> 20:36.778
(Donald groaning)

20:49.457 --> 20:54.421
- Good morning, Houston's
5:32 AM, Friday, May 27th.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.965
I'm Asa Zane, CBZ News.

20:57.007 --> 21:00.135
Our top story today a pig
was found stuck in a tree.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.637
After severe thunderstorms,
knocked a tree

21:02.679 --> 21:04.264
right through an upstairs window

21:04.305 --> 21:06.599
of a house in
south-east Houston,

21:06.641 --> 21:09.019
the family's pet pig made
its way out of the window,

21:09.060 --> 21:12.731
onto the tree branch, but
could not make its way down.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.442
Firefighters have been on
the premise for three hours

21:15.483 --> 21:18.945
trying to get the
pig down to safety.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.948
Breaking news out of
Willis, Texas this morning.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.408
Two bodies were found,

21:23.450 --> 21:26.286
painted and tied to trees
near the McCoy Farm.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.663
Joanne Bloom is on the scene.

21:28.705 --> 21:34.753
(grass and leaves rustling)
(ominous music continues)

21:34.794 --> 21:36.129
- Everything all
right at home, man?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.797
Yeah, everything's fine.

21:37.839 --> 21:40.425
She's safe inside the house,
that's all that matters to me.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.345
(Donald groaning)

21:43.386 --> 21:46.556
(Blessing screaming)

22:01.237 --> 22:03.907
(fist thudding)

22:03.948 --> 22:06.451
(Donald panting)

22:15.794 --> 22:16.920
Fuck me, huh?

22:18.213 --> 22:19.130
Fuck me.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.969
(gentle rock music)

22:26.388 --> 22:31.393
(helicopter roaring)
(sirens whirring)

22:32.435 --> 22:35.480
* It's late, it's
late at night

22:35.522 --> 22:40.527
* And I'm all alone

22:42.570 --> 22:45.448
* It's late and I am talking

22:45.490 --> 22:47.992
Anybody find anything?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.160
And you?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.328
Nothing.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.790
- (Revis sighing)
- So what now?

22:53.832 --> 22:58.920
* I'm gonna take you
out on the town

23:02.674 --> 23:04.551
* I'll make you crazy

23:04.592 --> 23:09.597
* I'll make you take
off all your clothes

23:13.059 --> 23:18.106
* And do you know which way
to go so we can lie down

23:23.611 --> 23:28.491
* Do you know which way
to go so we can lie down

23:31.161 --> 23:36.041
* You make me feel so crazy

23:37.083 --> 23:41.171
* You make me feel so crazy

23:42.213 --> 23:46.509
* You make me feel so crazy

23:47.385 --> 23:51.473
* You make me feel so crazy

23:52.349 --> 23:54.517
* You make me feel so crazy

23:54.559 --> 23:57.937
* And I say baby, please
with sugar on top

23:57.979 --> 24:03.902
* Cause I don't wanna mess
with you unless you can fuck

24:03.943 --> 24:08.281
* I said god damn

24:08.323 --> 24:11.159
* I said god damn

24:12.118 --> 24:14.287
[Protesters] DGK! DGK!

24:14.329 --> 24:15.497
DGK!

24:15.538 --> 24:16.414
- DGK! DGK!
- Okay, alL right.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.667
- DGK!
- Oh wait, yo, yo, yo!

24:19.751 --> 24:20.960
- It's been three months
- DGK, DGK!

24:21.002 --> 24:22.629
since child actor
turned college student

24:22.671 --> 24:25.632
Janelle Jameson was
last seen at LAX airport

24:25.674 --> 24:27.133
- Since then,
- DGK, DGK!

24:27.175 --> 24:28.843
- People around the world are
waiting impatiently to see if

24:28.885 --> 24:31.346
she would be the latest victim
of the doppelganger killer,

24:31.388 --> 24:34.432
or as the kids like to
refer to him as DGK.

24:34.474 --> 24:37.477
Well, tonight that
question has been answered.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.937
Janelle Jameson was
found in the back woods

24:38.978 --> 24:41.648
of the Hatfield McCoy
Farm body painted

24:41.690 --> 24:45.151
and bound to a tree opposite
of her doppelganger.

24:45.193 --> 24:45.985
What's going on here?

24:46.027 --> 24:47.445
It's like reality TV.

24:47.487 --> 24:48.905
We know we shouldn't
like it (giggling),

24:48.947 --> 24:51.408
but more than like it,
we obsessed with it.

24:51.449 --> 24:52.575
DGK!

24:52.617 --> 24:54.369
- DGK!
- So, excuse me, Agent.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.870
Any clues as to
where DGK is hiding

24:55.912 --> 24:59.374
and what makes him so
difficult for the FBI to catch?

24:59.416 --> 25:00.291
- Move aside.
- Okay.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.668
Excuse, excuse my partner.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.420
What he meant to
say was no comment.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.088
So what about you, Agent?

25:05.130 --> 25:06.673
Agent Revis.

25:06.715 --> 25:09.551
Ferdinand Revis, Behavioral
Analysis Unit, FBI.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.011
So Agent Revis,

25:11.052 --> 25:12.470
do you have a comment
on the recent abduction

25:12.512 --> 25:13.930
and death of Janelle Jameson

25:13.972 --> 25:16.307
and the other young lady
that was found here tonight?

25:16.349 --> 25:17.684
You know what Joanne, I do.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.978
I really don't like
living in a neighborhood

25:20.020 --> 25:23.773
where the people who I
care about don't feel safe.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.608
You have it first, Houston,

25:25.650 --> 25:27.610
DGK may have gotten
away yet again,

25:27.652 --> 25:30.697
but with people like
Agent Revis on the case,

25:30.739 --> 25:35.285
it won't be long before
DGK is put into J. A. I. L.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.119
Jail.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.203
Yes.

25:37.245 --> 25:38.079
Is that all?

25:38.121 --> 25:39.372
Yes.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.582
Thank you.

25:40.623 --> 25:41.541
Anytime.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.835
I might hold you to that.

25:45.003 --> 25:47.756
(ominous music)

25:53.428 --> 25:55.388
- You know the worst
part about my job guys,

25:55.430 --> 25:57.766
is watching people have to
come in here and identify the

25:57.807 --> 26:00.060
bodies of those that they love.

26:00.101 --> 26:02.062
And you would think by now
that I'd be numb to this shit,

26:02.103 --> 26:03.063
but I'm not.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.733
Um, are you all right?

26:06.775 --> 26:09.235
- I, I'm, I'm fine,
Agent Rollins.

26:09.277 --> 26:10.070
I'm, I'm sorry.

26:10.111 --> 26:11.738
I mean, Iceberg.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.367
I only have a half hour left
with no more bodies to cut up.

26:15.408 --> 26:16.743
Anyway,

26:16.785 --> 26:18.161
this one right here
is Paislee Parks

26:18.203 --> 26:21.456
and her parents just left from
here identifying her body.

26:21.498 --> 26:23.541
She and the movie star.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.251
- Movie Star?
- Yes, movie star.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.878
That's what she was, right?

26:26.920 --> 26:29.798
- Well, uh, she wasn't, she
wasn't necessarily a movie star.

26:29.839 --> 26:32.717
I would call her,
it was a TV show.

26:32.759 --> 26:33.760
And actually while she wasn't

26:33.802 --> 26:35.553
- the star of the show,
- Revis.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.763
Hold on, gimme a second.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.806
While she wasn't the
real star, the real star

26:37.847 --> 26:39.683
- was really her brother,
- Revis.

26:39.724 --> 26:40.892
- Arnold Green.
- Revis.

26:40.934 --> 26:41.935
He had a line in there.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.978
- "Hmm. I Wonder if..."
- Revis.

26:44.020 --> 26:47.691
- Anyway, guys, both women
suffer from the exact same type

26:47.732 --> 26:48.942
of puncture wound,

26:48.983 --> 26:52.445
a knife to their
abdominal aorta.

26:52.487 --> 26:54.739
Why to the abdominal aorta?

26:54.781 --> 26:57.701
Why not to the
wrist or the throat?

26:57.742 --> 27:00.870
- The wrist or the neck
would be too messy.

27:00.912 --> 27:03.039
Stabbing the victim
through the abdominal aorta

27:03.081 --> 27:06.084
is the quickest way to kill
them, and it's the cleanest.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.461
Makes it easier for him
to body paint afterwards.

27:08.503 --> 27:12.257
- (ominous music)
- That's right.

27:20.181 --> 27:23.184
(typewriters tapping)

27:32.736 --> 27:34.946
[Woman] It's over there.

27:38.700 --> 27:42.829
- What the Fuck y'all
doing, get back to work.

27:44.581 --> 27:45.832
Man.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.459
- I have to make a
phone call real quick.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.127
Yeah, for sure, man.

27:53.256 --> 27:54.466
(Rollins sighing)

27:54.507 --> 27:56.676
Hey sweetheart, if um,

27:56.718 --> 27:58.803
if you're sleeping
good, don't wake up.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.388
I was just calling
to check on you.

28:00.430 --> 28:02.098
I'm sorry I'm not there.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.310
But uh, give me call
when you wake up.

28:09.356 --> 28:11.358
Revis, lemme ask you a question.

28:11.399 --> 28:12.275
[Revis] Yo.

28:13.902 --> 28:16.363
- What do you see when
you look at this wall?

28:16.404 --> 28:17.238
Uh.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.366
Uh.

28:19.407 --> 28:20.241
I see a,

28:21.242 --> 28:22.869
I see an artist,

28:22.911 --> 28:25.538
um, possibly a twin.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.665
We got some twin
scenarios over here.

28:27.707 --> 28:28.708
And you know, for
the past three years

28:28.750 --> 28:30.960
we've been looking for an,

28:31.002 --> 28:34.422
an artist who's a twin with
some type of a criminal history.

28:34.464 --> 28:35.882
Or,

28:35.924 --> 28:38.259
or, or a background
of violent behavior.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.887
- Okay, well let's just forget
the psychology for a second.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.764
Just give me the basics.
(Revis chuckling)

28:42.806 --> 28:43.598
How does he do it?

28:43.640 --> 28:45.266
How does he move?

28:45.308 --> 28:49.104
- Well, he finds his
victim a man or a woman.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.023
And then he keeps
them tucked away

28:52.065 --> 28:54.984
for as long as he finds
their doppelganger.

28:55.026 --> 28:56.653
Once he finds the doppelganger,

28:56.695 --> 28:58.071
he kills them both.
(woman groaning)

28:58.113 --> 28:59.364
And then he paints their bodies

28:59.406 --> 29:02.826
and then he makes it
in a fashion of art

29:02.867 --> 29:04.953
- as you see here.
- Yep.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.746
Is there a timetable?

29:06.788 --> 29:07.997
Well,

29:08.039 --> 29:10.000
the first one took
about three years.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.877
The next one took about
a year and a half.

29:12.919 --> 29:16.423
Now this one we have just
now, that took about uh,

29:16.464 --> 29:17.298
thirty days.

29:18.508 --> 29:20.719
So he's getting better.

29:20.760 --> 29:21.553
[Man 3] Hey, yo, Revis.

29:21.594 --> 29:22.929
Yo.

29:22.971 --> 29:23.847
- [Man 3] You might
wanna pick up line two.

29:23.888 --> 29:26.224
It's that fine ass reporter.

29:34.649 --> 29:38.194
- Special Agent
Revis FBI, go ahead.

29:38.236 --> 29:39.988
- Ferdinand, how are you?
- Ferdinand, hey.

29:40.030 --> 29:40.947
I know who this is?

29:40.989 --> 29:42.282
Hey Joanne, how you doing?

29:42.323 --> 29:42.991
How you doing?

29:43.033 --> 29:44.451
Um, how can I help you?

29:44.492 --> 29:47.746
- I was wondering if you would
like to get a cup of coffee?

29:47.787 --> 29:48.955
Wait a minute.

29:48.997 --> 29:50.665
Are you trying to poke
me for DGK information?

29:50.707 --> 29:51.624
No.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.084
I just like who you are as a man

29:53.126 --> 29:54.627
and I would like to
get to know you better

29:54.669 --> 29:56.129
over a cup of coffee.

29:56.171 --> 29:58.465
- (clearing throat) I would
love to get that cup of coffee,

29:58.506 --> 30:00.008
with you, Joanne.

30:00.050 --> 30:01.301
- Okay, so each one of DGK's
- But um, uh,

30:01.343 --> 30:02.677
- I gotta get back to work
- Victims where last seen

30:02.719 --> 30:04.137
- Right now
- in different parts

30:04.179 --> 30:05.889
of the world and then
found dead here in Houston.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.223
[Revis] Right.

30:07.265 --> 30:11.186
So Lonnie Lewis, he was
last seen in Australia.

30:14.356 --> 30:15.982
Stella Estefan,

30:16.024 --> 30:18.610
she was last seen in Mexico.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.236
And then we've got
Janelle Jameson,

30:20.278 --> 30:22.322
she was actually spotted
on LAX surveillance

30:22.364 --> 30:24.532
with an airline pilot the
night she went missing.

30:24.574 --> 30:25.992
We know.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.994
We've been searching the
whole Houston database

30:28.036 --> 30:29.579
for pilots coming in and out

30:29.621 --> 30:31.498
on the nights of
the kidnappings.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.166
So far we have nothing

30:33.208 --> 30:37.462
that links any of the
victims to any one pilot.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.213
Okay.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.549
And lastly, we
have Paislee Parks.

30:41.591 --> 30:42.801
She was the only one not seen

30:42.842 --> 30:44.219
in a different
part of the world.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.930
She was actually at an arts
exhibition here in Houston.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.891
(mid tempo music)

30:59.859 --> 31:01.069
Mark Tru?

31:02.112 --> 31:02.862
Yes.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.280
John Rollins, FBI.

31:04.322 --> 31:06.825
This is my partner.
Special Agent Wilford.

31:06.866 --> 31:07.742
Is this?

31:07.784 --> 31:09.119
- How you doing?
- All right.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.370
Is this about last night?

31:10.412 --> 31:11.996
Yes, uh,

31:12.038 --> 31:13.498
the event was this
invitation only, correct?

31:13.540 --> 31:14.624
Correct, uh,

31:14.666 --> 31:16.126
my younger brother has autism,

31:16.167 --> 31:18.294
so every year I invite a few
important friends to my gallery

31:18.336 --> 31:21.214
to auction off few pieces
for the Tru Foundation.

31:21.256 --> 31:23.633
We're dedicated to helping
children with autism.

31:23.675 --> 31:24.801
It's beautiful.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.554
It was a very private affair.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.014
And you are?

31:29.055 --> 31:31.725
- Margo, Mr. Tru's
personal secretary.

31:31.766 --> 31:33.059
- Margo's much more
than a secretary.

31:33.101 --> 31:35.061
She does all the actual
work around here,

31:35.103 --> 31:36.896
including the planning
for the True Foundation.

31:36.938 --> 31:38.523
Wait, you planned the event?

31:38.565 --> 31:39.941
Yes, I did.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.860
- And I'm assuming you
knew everyone who attended?

31:41.901 --> 31:43.778
We know mostly everyone, yes.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.905
- All invited guests
were allowed a plus one.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.532
So there's a guest list?

31:47.574 --> 31:48.742
Yes.

31:48.783 --> 31:49.951
- Was Paislee
Parks on that list?

31:49.993 --> 31:50.994
Absolutely.

31:51.036 --> 31:52.787
Paislee was a childhood friend.

31:52.829 --> 31:54.873
Her family helped me to
open my first gallery.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.167
I owe everything I have to them.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.252
- When was the last
time you saw Ms. Parks?

31:59.294 --> 32:01.254
- She was standing
right over there

32:01.296 --> 32:04.424
talking to some large
scrumptious piece of man.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.968
(group laughing)

32:10.472 --> 32:12.015
And then they left.

32:12.057 --> 32:13.600
- Wait, you saw
who she left with?

32:13.641 --> 32:14.726
I saw her with a man.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.269
I don't know who he was.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.731
- Then, how do you know
he, he was scrumptious.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.524
I saw what I needed to see.

32:21.566 --> 32:22.776
Which was what?

32:22.817 --> 32:23.943
His eyes were dark.

32:23.985 --> 32:26.071
His skin was milk,
chocolate and smooth.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.739
He was wearing a black suit.

32:27.781 --> 32:29.783
He had a very masculine build.

32:29.824 --> 32:31.868
You would think
he lived in a gym.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.703
- Okay, so what
about surveillance?

32:33.745 --> 32:35.121
Cameras were off.

32:35.163 --> 32:37.415
Our guests do not
like to be recorded.

32:37.457 --> 32:39.125
They're the type
of wealthy people

32:39.167 --> 32:41.294
that don't like to take credit
for the money that they give,

32:41.336 --> 32:43.171
but can't wait to brag about it

32:43.213 --> 32:46.383
amongst their other
wealthy friends.

32:46.424 --> 32:47.300
Margo right?

32:47.342 --> 32:48.468
Yes.

32:48.510 --> 32:49.803
- Do you mind if we get
a copy of that list?

32:49.844 --> 32:51.096
Not at all.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.851
- Who's the artist
of this piece?

32:56.893 --> 32:58.770
Actually, I have no idea.

32:58.812 --> 33:00.313
Paislee brought
it in last night.

33:00.355 --> 33:01.690
I don't really see what's
so special about it,

33:01.731 --> 33:06.361
but she was adamant that I
hang it up for the auction.

33:07.862 --> 33:08.947
Thank you for your time.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.198
Certainly.

33:13.159 --> 33:16.079
(phone ringing)

33:18.873 --> 33:21.626
(ominous music)

33:39.769 --> 33:42.564
(knocking on door)

33:45.608 --> 33:47.068
Can I help you?

33:49.404 --> 33:51.781
- FBI, we're looking
for Mario Allen.

33:51.823 --> 33:53.158
Uh, I'm his daughter, Rae.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.409
What do you want with him?

33:54.451 --> 33:56.327
- We just wanna ask
him a few questions.

33:56.369 --> 33:57.996
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

33:58.038 --> 34:00.081
My dad passed away
a few days ago.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.082
Car crash.

34:02.751 --> 34:04.127
Sorry to hear, sorry.

34:04.169 --> 34:05.462
I'm sorry it happened.

34:05.503 --> 34:08.089
(upbeat music)

34:17.265 --> 34:22.103
* You can't get
enough reaction

34:25.106 --> 34:30.153
* Oh come on, don't
play me for a fool

34:32.489 --> 34:37.577
* With your strap stuck in
girl you such a distraction

34:40.789 --> 34:43.875
* I've got one and one and one

34:43.917 --> 34:48.672
* But you're so cool

34:49.798 --> 34:51.257
* Oh won't you call me

34:51.299 --> 34:54.302
* Beg me cause
you feel so good

34:54.344 --> 34:56.137
* Come get you down and dirty

34:56.179 --> 34:58.306
* Won't you do my back up here

34:58.348 --> 35:02.268
* Gonna make you beg me
cause you feel so good

35:02.310 --> 35:04.437
* Come get you down and dirty

35:04.479 --> 35:05.730
* Won't you do my back up here

35:05.772 --> 35:08.942
* I'll make you beg me
cause you feel so good

35:08.983 --> 35:11.778
* It's so good

35:11.820 --> 35:13.363
(planks rattling)

35:13.405 --> 35:16.658
(Mike clearing throat)

35:18.868 --> 35:21.579
(whooshing music)

35:27.752 --> 35:30.714
(knock on door)

35:30.755 --> 35:31.965
Mike Hamlin?

35:32.007 --> 35:33.258
Yup.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.634
[Rollins] FBI.

35:36.094 --> 35:37.220
I'm busy.

35:37.929 --> 35:40.515
This won't take but a minute.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.769
- What does the FBI want
with little old Mike Hamlin?

35:44.811 --> 35:45.603
DGK.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.356
Doppelganger killer?

35:48.398 --> 35:49.816
You're familiar with him?

35:49.858 --> 35:51.985
- I do a little news
peeping from time to time.

35:52.027 --> 35:53.820
Yeah.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.488
See all those T-shirts outside.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.157
Large crowds worshiping this guy

35:57.198 --> 35:59.451
like he's the second
coming of public Picasso.

35:59.492 --> 36:02.412
- You seem agitated, man.
- Of course I'm agitated.

36:02.454 --> 36:05.832
I'm over here pouring my heart
and soul into my artwork,

36:05.874 --> 36:07.542
getting fucking nowhere.

36:07.584 --> 36:11.171
And so long as those idiots
out there are cheering him on,

36:11.212 --> 36:13.673
pepping him up, buying
buying his fucking T-shirts,

36:13.715 --> 36:16.009
the more destructive
he's likely gonna be.

36:16.051 --> 36:16.843
And this guy, what?

36:16.885 --> 36:18.053
He kills three people.

36:18.094 --> 36:21.097
A few, I don't know how many.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.309
Fuck, the whole world stops.

36:24.351 --> 36:26.770
And now they're talking about
him being the greatest artist

36:26.811 --> 36:29.272
of our fucking generation.

36:29.314 --> 36:33.777
- Did you attend a charity
event last night in Houston?

36:33.818 --> 36:35.195
Yes, I did.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.781
Did you leave with anyone?

36:37.822 --> 36:38.907
No, I did not.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.452
So you two, let yourselves out.

37:01.137 --> 37:03.306
(bottle smacking against wall)

37:03.348 --> 37:06.976
(birds chirping)

37:07.018 --> 37:08.436
(knocking on door)

37:08.478 --> 37:13.274
(whooshing music)
(people shouting)

37:14.776 --> 37:16.194
(dog barking)

37:16.236 --> 37:19.030
- Are you guys looking
for Donald Keller.

37:21.116 --> 37:22.909
Special agent John Rollins.

37:22.951 --> 37:24.369
This is my partner.

37:24.411 --> 37:25.954
Special Agent Revis.

37:25.995 --> 37:27.580
Is he in trouble?

37:27.622 --> 37:29.374
No, we just wanna talk to him.

37:29.416 --> 37:31.084
- Well, you won't
find him in there.

37:31.126 --> 37:32.919
He usually flies on Wednesdays.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.671
He is an airplane pilot.

37:34.713 --> 37:35.755
And you are?

37:35.797 --> 37:37.507
Larry Walters.

37:37.549 --> 37:40.677
I'm the maintenance
man for this building.

37:40.719 --> 37:44.180
- Hey, Larry, you mind if we
have a look in here real quick?

37:44.222 --> 37:46.599
I don't usually do this,

37:46.641 --> 37:50.603
but I was on my way in
there to fix a leaky faucet.

37:50.645 --> 37:52.022
I won't suggest one of
you fellows know anything

37:52.063 --> 37:53.648
about leaky faucet, huh?

37:53.690 --> 37:54.649
I sure do.

37:54.691 --> 37:57.068
- I, I sure, I
do, I do and will.

38:02.949 --> 38:05.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:05.368 --> 38:08.121
Let's have a look
around real quick.

38:08.163 --> 38:09.622
(tool bag slamming on counter)

38:09.664 --> 38:13.126
- You're looking for
the DGK, aren't you?

38:13.168 --> 38:14.461
What makes you say that?

38:14.502 --> 38:16.171
I've seen this guy on TV.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.922
He's looks like a
real standup guy.

38:17.964 --> 38:20.091
A real likable hero.

38:20.133 --> 38:21.134
Well appreciate that, Larry.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.719
I appreciate that.

38:22.761 --> 38:25.096
- I always thought there was
something funny about this guy.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.973
Funny. Like how?

38:27.015 --> 38:28.391
Look at his apartment.

38:28.433 --> 38:30.060
And the guy's a
fucking neat freak.

38:30.101 --> 38:31.227
And not to mention

38:31.269 --> 38:33.980
he got two of almost everything.

38:34.022 --> 38:35.690
I asked him, "Fool,

38:35.732 --> 38:37.025
why do you have to have two
of so much in your apartment?"

38:37.067 --> 38:38.651
What'd he say?

38:38.693 --> 38:40.278
- He said he has a obsessive
compulsive disorder,

38:40.320 --> 38:43.156
which causes him to have
to see things and twos.

38:43.198 --> 38:44.616
What about two women?

38:44.657 --> 38:46.159
Does he need two of those?

38:46.201 --> 38:48.119
- [Larry] Good
question. I never asked.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.537
Oh, freaky boy.

38:49.579 --> 38:50.830
I know, I know,
if it was me, I...

38:50.872 --> 38:53.166
- You can't go in there
unless you have a warrant.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.292
Mr. Keller specifically asked

38:54.334 --> 38:56.586
that I never enter his bedroom.

38:56.628 --> 38:58.380
- Why do you think
that is, Larry?

38:58.421 --> 38:59.839
It's his bedroom.

38:59.881 --> 39:01.716
No telling what type of
freaky shit he got going on,

39:01.758 --> 39:05.011
but whatever it is, it's
his personal business.

39:05.053 --> 39:07.722
(ominous music)

39:34.457 --> 39:37.460
(door squeaking)

39:50.432 --> 39:53.977
(ominous music continues)

40:21.254 --> 40:24.799
(ominous music continues)

40:41.107 --> 40:44.152
(gentle piano music)

41:04.422 --> 41:07.175
(ominous music)

41:08.218 --> 41:10.929
[Woman] Doctor's catalog, 320.

41:16.267 --> 41:19.187
(indistinct chatter)

41:26.486 --> 41:27.487
(waves sploshing)

41:27.529 --> 41:30.532
(birds chirping)

41:55.557 --> 41:58.143
- We're gonna find
your wife, Iceberg.

41:58.184 --> 42:00.020
I promise you that bro.

42:01.396 --> 42:03.690
He took a boat.

42:03.732 --> 42:05.191
We were looking for him
in the fucking woods

42:05.233 --> 42:06.776
and he took the boat.

42:13.324 --> 42:16.202
(gentle rock music)

43:03.416 --> 43:07.295
(gentle rock music continues)

43:12.384 --> 43:15.637
(door latch clanking)

43:23.478 --> 43:26.231
(door creaking)

43:33.655 --> 43:37.242
(Blessing sighing)

43:37.283 --> 43:38.827
Who are you?

43:38.868 --> 43:41.830
- My name is Donald,
Graham, Keller

43:46.501 --> 43:47.419
Hi,

43:49.087 --> 43:49.796
Donald.

43:52.841 --> 43:56.177
- My name Blessing.
- So Blessing Rollins,

43:58.179 --> 43:59.180
psychologist,

44:00.640 --> 44:02.434
specializing in phobias.

44:02.475 --> 44:04.019
I know who you are.

44:05.645 --> 44:07.272
You are the unjust.

44:09.774 --> 44:13.153
And your day of
reckoning is coming.

44:13.194 --> 44:14.404
You're judging me?

44:14.446 --> 44:16.031
Yes I am.

44:16.072 --> 44:16.698
Why?

44:20.535 --> 44:22.120
You chose death.

44:23.705 --> 44:27.751
I decided to affect others
with your solid education.

44:29.502 --> 44:30.879
You're insane.

44:33.840 --> 44:36.718
(Donald laughing)

44:41.222 --> 44:44.559
- Of course I'm
insane, Dr. Rollins.

44:44.601 --> 44:46.686
We all are to some degree,

44:46.728 --> 44:49.689
but you don't want
to hear that do you?

44:49.731 --> 44:51.483
You want me to say
that I am not insane,

44:51.524 --> 44:53.401
so you can say that I'm insane

44:53.443 --> 44:56.946
and feel better about having
done all of those degrees

44:56.988 --> 45:00.200
and sit on your ass and
listen to all the cheer.

45:00.241 --> 45:03.828
But you don't know shit
about true insanity!

45:06.414 --> 45:10.043
- I know more than you
think I know, Donald.

45:10.085 --> 45:13.755
- Have you ever truly
been insane, Dr. Rollins?

45:13.797 --> 45:17.676
Have you ever lived
in a dead mind?

45:17.717 --> 45:19.678
Have you ever
orchestrated thoughts

45:19.719 --> 45:22.639
that would only
play unwanted music?

45:22.681 --> 45:25.642
Have you ever been
who you are not

45:25.684 --> 45:28.728
and not been able
to be who you are?

45:28.770 --> 45:29.813
Have you?

45:33.900 --> 45:35.735
(Donald sighing)

45:35.777 --> 45:37.779
Of course you haven't.

45:40.407 --> 45:41.950
You're him.

45:41.991 --> 45:44.327
You're the doppelganger killer.

45:44.369 --> 45:45.578
(Blessing panting)

45:45.620 --> 45:47.163
You've heard of me?

45:48.707 --> 45:51.084
My husband's FBI.

45:51.126 --> 45:53.253
Of course I have heard of you.

45:53.294 --> 45:55.588
You kidnap random people and
hold them against their will

45:55.630 --> 45:58.800
until you can find
their doppelganger.

46:01.636 --> 46:03.638
Is that what this is?

46:03.680 --> 46:07.017
(Blessing panting and sobbing)

46:07.058 --> 46:09.436
Are you gonna kill me?

46:09.477 --> 46:11.312
You are the unjust.

46:11.354 --> 46:12.772
What did I do?

46:12.814 --> 46:15.942
- You killed innocent
babies without remorse.

46:19.821 --> 46:21.823
- My husband is out
there looking for me,

46:21.865 --> 46:24.159
backed by the most powerful
law enforcement agency

46:24.200 --> 46:25.076
in the world.

46:30.123 --> 46:30.832
I know.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.336
I know the FBI is after me.

46:35.503 --> 46:37.339
I am also not afraid.

46:39.632 --> 46:41.718
That's your first mistake.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.511
You should be afraid.

46:44.804 --> 46:47.057
My husband is a very
rational human being.

46:47.098 --> 46:52.520
But when pushed to the point
of anger, he has no control.

46:52.562 --> 46:54.814
He is gonna find you.

46:54.856 --> 46:56.358
He is gonna know what
you have done to me.

46:56.399 --> 46:58.443
And he's gonna march right
in here without hesitation

46:58.485 --> 47:00.820
and put bullets right
in your fucking face.

47:00.862 --> 47:04.157
(Donald laughing)

47:04.199 --> 47:09.037
(Donald's hands clapping)
(Donald continues laughing)

47:10.955 --> 47:12.874
I hope you're right.

47:13.667 --> 47:15.502
I really hope you're right.

47:15.543 --> 47:20.048
I hope that Special Agent
John Rollins, aka Iceberg

47:23.218 --> 47:27.013
will just walk out here and
point a gun right into my head

47:27.055 --> 47:30.517
and empty some bullets
without hesitations.

47:30.558 --> 47:32.018
I hope you're right.

47:34.521 --> 47:36.147
You are the unjust.

47:37.732 --> 47:41.528
The children need to
be saved from you,

47:41.569 --> 47:42.362
and the art,

47:44.364 --> 47:46.574
(Donald sighing)

47:46.616 --> 47:49.369
the art needs to
be immortalized.

47:49.411 --> 47:51.913
(ominous music)

47:52.789 --> 47:55.208
You see, I am the righteous.

47:56.084 --> 47:57.919
The people love me.

47:58.837 --> 48:01.715
They call out my
name everywhere.

48:01.756 --> 48:04.426
Because of me,
justice will prevail.

48:05.635 --> 48:08.388
(ominous music)

48:10.056 --> 48:12.684
(upbeat music)

48:20.108 --> 48:24.237
- So what made you
want to join the FBI?

48:24.279 --> 48:26.489
- I was lost, I needed
some direction in life.

48:26.531 --> 48:29.075
A recruiter thought I'd be
a good fit, and here we are.

48:29.117 --> 48:32.287
So what made you
wanna be a reporter?

48:32.328 --> 48:33.038
Same thing.

48:33.079 --> 48:34.122
Plus, I'm nosy.

48:34.164 --> 48:36.624
(Joanne and Revis laughing)

48:36.666 --> 48:37.876
(Joanne sighing)

48:37.917 --> 48:39.044
I like you.

48:41.296 --> 48:44.632
I don't like anybody,
but I like you.

48:44.674 --> 48:46.176
I like you more.

48:48.470 --> 48:50.096
Let's get out of here.

48:50.138 --> 48:52.557
I have something
I want you to see.

48:52.599 --> 48:54.768
* Lies

48:54.809 --> 48:57.937
* I am floating in
the loving bliss

48:57.979 --> 48:59.064
This is a bed.

48:59.105 --> 49:00.273
Yes, it is.

49:00.315 --> 49:02.025
- Some would say it's
made for sleeping.

49:02.067 --> 49:03.026
Some people.

49:03.068 --> 49:05.153
* Gotta get your takeout

49:05.195 --> 49:07.322
* Wake up, wake up

49:07.364 --> 49:09.783
* Round gone gets me pay cut

49:09.824 --> 49:11.785
* What you gonna do

49:11.826 --> 49:14.120
* What's the legs for

49:14.162 --> 49:16.164
* I ain't here to lose me

49:16.206 --> 49:18.792
* Wondering to choose me

49:18.833 --> 49:21.795
* Skies
* Yeah

49:21.836 --> 49:23.797
* Rolling into waves
* Come on

49:23.838 --> 49:27.634
* Crashing into shores

49:27.676 --> 49:30.345
(floor echoing)

49:37.644 --> 49:40.355
(ominous music)

49:44.067 --> 49:46.695
(door banging)

49:47.737 --> 49:51.074
(Blessing screaming)

50:04.045 --> 50:05.672
(Blessing sobbing)

50:05.714 --> 50:07.632
Help me please.

50:07.674 --> 50:08.717
Please help me.

50:11.720 --> 50:15.015
(door latch clanking)

50:15.056 --> 50:16.182
Shh, shh.

50:20.937 --> 50:23.732
(ominous music)

50:23.773 --> 50:25.650
Let me go!

50:25.692 --> 50:27.318
Get off of me!

50:27.360 --> 50:28.653
Let me go!

50:28.695 --> 50:29.529
Let me go!

50:30.905 --> 50:32.073
Let me out of here!

50:32.115 --> 50:34.367
Let me go.
(banging on door)

50:34.409 --> 50:34.826
Let me go!

50:38.246 --> 50:40.123
Let me go, no, no, no,
no, no, open the door.

50:40.165 --> 50:43.084
(door slamming)

50:44.586 --> 50:45.670
(keys rattling)

50:45.712 --> 50:47.756
(lock latching)

50:47.797 --> 50:50.383
(ominous music)

51:18.995 --> 51:22.624
(Blessing breathing heavily)

51:56.282 --> 52:00.453
(Blessing groaning and moaning)

52:39.993 --> 52:42.537
(eerie music)

52:52.797 --> 52:53.590
Help me!

52:55.050 --> 52:56.593
Somebody help me!

52:58.553 --> 53:01.806
Open the door.
(banging on door)

53:01.848 --> 53:04.392
(latch clanking)

53:09.105 --> 53:11.858
(door creaking)

53:26.039 --> 53:29.292
(Blessing groaning)

53:31.586 --> 53:35.423
You're wasting your
time trying to feed me.

53:37.175 --> 53:38.510
If I eat the food
and drink the water

53:38.551 --> 53:40.929
I stay incapacitated don't I?

53:41.805 --> 53:42.722
Huh?

53:44.307 --> 53:45.767
Think I'm stupid?

53:51.314 --> 53:52.857
(door creaking)

53:52.899 --> 53:56.403
(Blessing screaming)

53:56.444 --> 54:01.449
(Bowl shattering against door)
(water sploshing)

54:08.123 --> 54:09.374
Yeah.

54:09.416 --> 54:14.004
(Blessing screaming)
(Donald laughing)

54:21.094 --> 54:23.888
(Donald sighing)

54:29.811 --> 54:33.314
- All right y'all
listen up, listen up.

54:36.317 --> 54:37.694
So my wife's alive.

54:37.736 --> 54:39.029
(people sighing)

54:39.070 --> 54:41.281
That's the good news.

54:41.322 --> 54:43.491
The Doppelganger
killer can't kill her

54:43.533 --> 54:45.744
until he finds her
doppelganger, right?

54:45.785 --> 54:47.078
Right.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.247
- So he is out there somewhere
searching for someone

54:49.289 --> 54:51.958
that looks exactly like my wife.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.794
When he finds this woman,
he's gonna kill them both.

54:54.836 --> 54:56.171
[Woman 4] Wow.

54:56.212 --> 54:58.423
Now this is just one man.

54:58.465 --> 54:59.924
We're an agency of thousands.

54:59.966 --> 55:01.343
[Agents] Right, right, right.

55:01.384 --> 55:03.345
- [Commissioner] What exactly
are you saying, Iceberg?

55:03.386 --> 55:06.973
- What I'm saying is we need
to find this woman first.

55:07.015 --> 55:11.102
Get eyes on her, and then
wait for DGK to show his face.

55:11.144 --> 55:13.271
Her name is Iris Jones.

55:13.313 --> 55:15.315
She's a waitress
at a strip club.

55:15.357 --> 55:16.775
- Pass these out for me.
- Yes.

55:16.816 --> 55:18.610
- Uh, she has the same
height, same weight,

55:18.651 --> 55:20.945
same facial features
as your wife.

55:20.987 --> 55:22.447
If I didn't know any better,

55:22.489 --> 55:24.199
I would think she was your
wife, y'all take a look.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.701
[Agents] Oh wow, wow, wow.

55:26.743 --> 55:28.536
- All right, y'all,
here's a plan.

55:28.578 --> 55:31.247
I want surveillance on the
exterior of the strip club.

55:31.289 --> 55:32.332
HQ's is getting
run out of the van

55:32.374 --> 55:33.917
just like normal.

55:33.958 --> 55:35.835
Gallegos, Rick, Team One.

55:35.877 --> 55:37.253
[Rick] Got it.

55:37.295 --> 55:39.005
- [Iceberg] Shelly,
Mark, Team two.

55:39.047 --> 55:39.673
Got you.

55:40.882 --> 55:43.510
- On the interior I
want Adams and Solice.

55:43.551 --> 55:44.678
Everyone please make sure

55:44.719 --> 55:47.305
that you report to
group Supervisor Smith.

55:47.347 --> 55:48.807
On it Iceberg.

55:48.848 --> 55:50.934
- On air support, we have
at the Houston Air Wing,

55:50.975 --> 55:53.687
we have fixed wings
at Hooks airport.

55:53.728 --> 55:54.854
All right, for communications,

55:54.896 --> 55:57.023
we're going Channel
four FBI tag.

55:57.065 --> 55:58.817
All right, everybody,

55:58.858 --> 56:00.276
let's get to this.

56:00.318 --> 56:02.862
I want her found and I
want her surveilled 24/7.

56:02.904 --> 56:06.866
In other words, I wanna
know every move she makes.

56:06.908 --> 56:08.535
All right, everybody
has an assignment?

56:08.576 --> 56:10.328
- Yes sir.
- Yes.

56:10.370 --> 56:11.413
- Does anybody
have any questions?

56:11.454 --> 56:13.540
- No, sir.
- No.

56:13.581 --> 56:16.418
- Iceberg, where do
you want me and Sparks?

56:16.459 --> 56:18.211
I want you two with me.

56:18.253 --> 56:19.546
All right, let's get to it.

56:19.587 --> 56:20.755
Let's hit the streets.

56:20.797 --> 56:23.508
(hands clapping)

56:27.262 --> 56:30.056
(latch rattling)

56:32.142 --> 56:35.937
(lock clanking on floor)

56:35.979 --> 56:38.440
(door creaking)

56:46.239 --> 56:48.783
You still haven't eaten?

56:48.825 --> 56:49.659
No.

56:54.831 --> 56:55.540
Why?

56:56.666 --> 56:59.669
- Because there are
drugs in the food.

57:05.800 --> 57:09.471
(plates echoing on floor)

57:12.974 --> 57:16.144
- But if you don't
eat, you will die.

57:23.068 --> 57:24.819
I'm gonna die anyway.

57:31.576 --> 57:33.078
(Donald sighing)

57:33.119 --> 57:33.953
Okay.

57:42.504 --> 57:45.632
(Banana snapping)

57:58.853 --> 58:00.271
Eat Your food?

58:00.313 --> 58:01.147
No.

58:07.529 --> 58:09.030
Eat your food.

58:09.072 --> 58:10.448
I said no.

58:10.490 --> 58:12.575
- (Blessing screaming)
- Eat you fucking food!

58:12.617 --> 58:13.952
Eat your food!

58:13.993 --> 58:15.662
Put it in your
fucking mouth, eat it!

58:15.704 --> 58:17.580
Eat your fucking...!

58:19.249 --> 58:22.085
(Blessing choking and coughing)

58:22.127 --> 58:23.503
God.

58:23.545 --> 58:25.463
I am so sorry.

58:25.505 --> 58:27.173
I am so sorry.

58:27.215 --> 58:30.093
(Blessing screaming)

58:35.390 --> 58:39.102
(Donald breathing heavily)

58:39.144 --> 58:41.980
(Blessing choking)

58:42.022 --> 58:46.026
Why can't you just be
like the others, huh?

58:46.067 --> 58:49.696
Why can't you just
accept the inevitable?

58:49.738 --> 58:50.572
Why?

58:52.198 --> 58:54.200
Cause I have a life.

58:54.242 --> 58:55.660
I have a husband.

58:57.620 --> 58:59.873
I'm not just gonna
sit here and die

58:59.914 --> 59:04.210
so you can feel better about
what you're doing to me.

59:04.252 --> 59:06.880
(Blessing crying)

59:09.758 --> 59:11.843
Eat your fucking food.

59:14.679 --> 59:16.222
You eat it.

59:16.264 --> 59:17.766
Just eat your food.

59:20.602 --> 59:22.479
(door banging)

59:22.520 --> 59:24.397
(lock latching)

59:24.439 --> 59:29.152
(banging on glass)
Eat you fucking food

59:29.194 --> 59:31.654
(door creaking)

59:35.325 --> 59:38.036
(mid tempo music)

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:16.449
* I think to myself, I wonder

01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:20.787
* How much can she take

01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:25.417
* It's getting high now under

01:00:25.458 --> 01:00:29.295
* I'm drowning in this

01:00:29.337 --> 01:00:31.798
(ominous music)

01:00:38.555 --> 01:00:41.683
(locks clanking)

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.689
(door creaking)

01:01:03.413 --> 01:01:04.789
Okay, wait look.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.252
I wanna make a deal with you.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.714
You want me doped up

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.424
because it's easier to
control me that way.

01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:15.842
I, I get that.

01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:21.139
What if I promise to be good?

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:22.932
Okay?

01:01:22.974 --> 01:01:27.187
No screaming, no
violent attacks, no banging on the walls.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.359
What do you want?

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.443
I'm hungry.

01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:38.865
I just want to eat
without being drugged.

01:01:40.241 --> 01:01:42.202
And I don't, I don't want
that dog bowl either.

01:01:42.243 --> 01:01:43.828
It's demeaning.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.205
I know that's the
point of it all.

01:01:45.246 --> 01:01:48.083
But I don't want
to eat out of it.

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:52.754
And if I don't eat, I
will look malnourished.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.220
You need me healthy, Donald,

01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:01.346
in order for your artwork

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:04.432
to look as good as
you want it to look,

01:02:05.975 --> 01:02:07.852
you need me healthy.

01:02:10.689 --> 01:02:13.316
(Donald sighs)

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:28.581
(door creaking)

01:02:28.623 --> 01:02:30.250
(door slamming)

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:32.877
(locks clanking)

01:02:59.195 --> 01:03:01.948
(locks clanking)

01:03:03.241 --> 01:03:05.994
(door creaking)

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:18.923
Thank you.

01:03:22.552 --> 01:03:25.513
(paper bag rustling)

01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:31.186
(door creaking)

01:03:31.227 --> 01:03:33.855
(lock clanking)

01:03:39.527 --> 01:03:42.238
(ominous music)

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:56.961
Somethings wrong.

01:03:57.003 --> 01:03:59.422
We've been watching Iris
Jones for months and nothing.

01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:01.174
If she's not at work,
she's with her friends.

01:04:01.216 --> 01:04:04.135
If she's not with her
friends, she's alone.

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:07.347
I mean, there's been no
burglar, no gentleman caller.

01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:10.558
- She pretty much
lives a regular life doing regular things.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.019
- I'm letting my
wife down Revis.

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:16.272
- Maybe, maybe the DGK
is just buying time.

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:17.482
No, no, no.

01:04:17.524 --> 01:04:20.735
He is not going to
just sit by and wait.

01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:22.362
As soon as he finds my
wife's doppelganger,

01:04:22.404 --> 01:04:23.905
they're both gonna die.

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:26.032
- Then we just continue
watching Iris Jones

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.076
until the DGK finds her.

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.540
- What if she's not
the doppelganger?

01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:36.209
- What, what are you talking
about, what if she's not?

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:41.923
She looks exactly like your
wife, you even said it yourself.

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:45.093
(folder snapping)

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.014
Holy shit.

01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:52.100
[Revis] What?

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:56.354
- Every time we look at
this board, what do we see?

01:04:56.396 --> 01:04:57.480
We see the victims.

01:04:57.522 --> 01:04:58.732
We see the art,

01:04:58.773 --> 01:05:00.483
but we never see the names.

01:05:00.525 --> 01:05:01.609
- Why would we be
looking at the names?

01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.902
We already know their names.

01:05:02.944 --> 01:05:05.071
- The names are the
bread crumbs, Revis.

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:07.407
Look at Paislee Parks.

01:05:07.449 --> 01:05:09.451
How weird is it to spell
Paislee with two E's

01:05:09.492 --> 01:05:11.077
as opposed to E. Y?

01:05:11.828 --> 01:05:13.872
Janelle Jameson. Two L's.

01:05:13.913 --> 01:05:15.040
Lonny Lewis. Two N's.

01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:16.833
Terrel Thomas. Two Rs.

01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:20.420
Greenleaf Garrison.
Two E's, two R's.

01:05:20.462 --> 01:05:21.755
And now my wife.

01:05:21.796 --> 01:05:23.340
Blessings Rollins.

01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:24.466
Two S's.

01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:26.301
Two L's.
(whooshing)

01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:28.386
- So we not only looking
for a doppelganger,

01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:29.929
we're also looking
for a doppelganger

01:05:29.971 --> 01:05:31.806
with double letters in her name.

01:05:31.848 --> 01:05:33.350
Exactly.

01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:34.434
(Revis whistling)

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:37.103
(gentle music)

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.358
Is everything okay?

01:05:41.399 --> 01:05:43.318
* Ooh

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.236
* Ooh

01:05:45.278 --> 01:05:47.364
* Ooh

01:05:47.405 --> 01:05:51.826
* Ooh

01:05:51.868 --> 01:05:54.871
* I can't get rid
of this feeling.

01:05:54.913 --> 01:05:56.915
* I'm sitting here

01:05:56.956 --> 01:05:59.918
* You're laying there

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:03.713
* Our bodies are
matched in a rhythm

01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:05.799
* Might be some high

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.010
* Love's thick in the air

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.680
* Your scent is
so intoxicating

01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:13.139
Thank you.

01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:17.852
* Your eyes and mind
I could gaze in

01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:22.691
* Your touch is
so amazing, yeah

01:06:26.027 --> 01:06:29.656
* I'm losing my mind and
it's because of you

01:06:29.698 --> 01:06:34.703
* You got me losing my mind
and it's because of you

01:06:36.204 --> 01:06:36.746
* I'm feeling so high and
it's because of you.

01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:37.706
I love you.

01:06:38.873 --> 01:06:42.002
I don't think I said it enough.

01:06:42.043 --> 01:06:43.837
I know you love me.

01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:45.213
* I am going insane

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:47.674
* Your love has
me going insane

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:49.092
Now, find me.

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:54.097
(gentle music)
(clock ticking)

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:02.772
- What did he do for a living?
- Iceberg,

01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:04.691
Look at this, man.

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:05.525
What am I looking at?

01:07:05.567 --> 01:07:06.651
The rocker.

01:07:06.693 --> 01:07:08.695
She looks just like your wife.

01:07:08.737 --> 01:07:09.696
No, she is nothing

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:10.530
- like my wife.
- I didn't say

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:11.823
she is like your wife.

01:07:11.865 --> 01:07:14.409
I said, she looks
like your wife.

01:07:15.785 --> 01:07:18.371
Now look at the name.

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.581
Jaleece, geez.

01:07:20.790 --> 01:07:22.375
* Locked and loaded

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.044
* Let me come play with
them before I explode it

01:07:24.085 --> 01:07:26.296
* All over the place
and all over the room

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.798
(police siren whirring)
* All the ladies with

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:29.758
* It hurts

01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:31.051
* When I hit the door.

01:07:31.092 --> 01:07:32.135
* Salute a true Diva

01:07:32.177 --> 01:07:32.969
* When I cross the floor

01:07:33.011 --> 01:07:34.346
* All right rest

01:07:34.387 --> 01:07:36.097
* Gotta a red bottoms on

01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:38.183
* At ease all here
plus the Rose is home

01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:39.684
* Been running all week

01:07:39.726 --> 01:07:42.062
* Waiting for a moment
to get in these streets

01:07:42.103 --> 01:07:44.898
* Four months later
it's my time watch me

01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:47.901
* As I move my feet

01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:49.069
* Feel the rhythm and weep

01:07:49.110 --> 01:07:50.570
* Ignite assignment

01:07:50.612 --> 01:07:53.907
* This night will be atomic
pleasure, weak until we leave

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:56.910
* Careful now as we release

01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:58.495
* Bombshells

01:07:58.536 --> 01:08:00.663
* Wonder how we keep
'em here so well

01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:03.083
* Guaranteed to make
every heart swell

01:08:03.124 --> 01:08:04.751
* Break him till
the knees weak

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:06.628
* Have him begging for help

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.254
* Bombshells

01:08:08.296 --> 01:08:10.423
* It's the best
place you ever felt

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:13.093
* So hot it make any man melt

01:08:13.134 --> 01:08:15.261
* He'll never want
anything else

01:08:15.303 --> 01:08:16.680
* But bombshells

01:08:16.721 --> 01:08:19.349
(ominous music)

01:08:37.117 --> 01:08:38.326
* Area

01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:40.453
* Bombshells they
busting out everywhere

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:41.955
* I can't
* I keep on playing myself

01:08:41.996 --> 01:08:42.789
* I can't
* I keep on playing myself

01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:44.290
* Bombshells

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:46.459
* Wonder how we keep
him here so well

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.962
* Guaranteed to make
every heart swell

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:50.422
* Break until the knees weak

01:08:50.463 --> 01:08:52.173
* Have him begging for help

01:08:52.215 --> 01:08:55.135
* Bombshells

01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:56.636
Is she in there?

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:57.804
Yeah, she's in there.

01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.848
What about our suspect, DGK?

01:08:59.889 --> 01:09:01.766
I don't think so.

01:09:01.808 --> 01:09:03.518
- Listen up everybody, I
want you to spread out.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.980
Check the area, make sure this
guy does not have eyes on us.

01:09:07.022 --> 01:09:08.273
I want a protective detail

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:10.567
on this artist
Jaleece at all times.

01:09:10.608 --> 01:09:11.234
Do you understand?

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.152
[Agents] Yes, sir.

01:09:12.193 --> 01:09:13.820
All right. Let's move out.

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:16.614
(dramatic music)

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:21.036
Man, do you ever sleep, man?

01:09:21.077 --> 01:09:22.829
Revis, good, you're here.

01:09:22.871 --> 01:09:23.955
Look at this.

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:28.168
DGK er, has a twin.

01:09:28.209 --> 01:09:31.379
Yeah, I've been
saying this all along.

01:09:34.049 --> 01:09:35.550
No, the boys in that photo,

01:09:35.592 --> 01:09:39.846
they were born on the same
day, but they're not twins.

01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:41.598
I don't understand.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:46.019
Irene and Jim Keller.

01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:49.189
They had a baby
boy, but not twins.

01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:50.315
Look at this.

01:09:53.943 --> 01:09:56.279
Okay, now look at this one.

01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:03.536
On the far right,
that's Irene Keller,

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:07.791
next to her, that's Jim
Keller, Donald Keller's father.

01:10:07.832 --> 01:10:10.460
None of the people on
that photo are twins.

01:10:10.502 --> 01:10:11.878
They're doppelgangers.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.088
Exactly.

01:10:13.129 --> 01:10:14.381
We need to go back
to Donald's apartment

01:10:14.422 --> 01:10:15.423
and find out what
was in that room

01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:17.008
we weren't allowed
to enter before.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:21.846
(indistinct chatter)
(gentle music)

01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:25.892
(dramatic music)

01:10:25.934 --> 01:10:27.310
Oh shit, what the?

01:10:27.352 --> 01:10:28.603
Oh my goodness.

01:11:02.804 --> 01:11:04.472
(door banging)

01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:08.309
(dramatic music continues)

01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:25.744
FBI, get back in the car!

01:11:32.917 --> 01:11:35.503
(gun cocking)

01:11:36.963 --> 01:11:40.342
(foot crashing on door)

01:11:41.426 --> 01:11:42.469
[Agent 1] Clear.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.303
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:44.846
[Agent 2] Clear.

01:11:45.847 --> 01:11:47.265
All clear.

01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:48.350
Damn.

01:11:49.225 --> 01:11:52.562
All right, let's get
forensics in here.

01:12:04.032 --> 01:12:05.241
Every nook and cranny.

01:12:05.283 --> 01:12:06.910
Don't miss a thing.

01:12:06.951 --> 01:12:08.244
Yes, sir.

01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:09.245
I Got the closet.

01:12:09.287 --> 01:12:10.205
And I got the door.

01:12:10.246 --> 01:12:11.498
Got some prints over here.

01:12:11.539 --> 01:12:13.458
Uh, let me see those.

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:17.170
Iceberg.

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.463
[Man 4] Ah fantastic.

01:12:18.505 --> 01:12:20.465
What you got there?

01:12:44.572 --> 01:12:48.410
- He has files on every
one of his victims.

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.204
Hmm.

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:52.831
Including your wife.

01:12:56.001 --> 01:12:56.793
Iceberg.

01:13:04.676 --> 01:13:06.886
All right, stop right there.

01:13:06.928 --> 01:13:08.471
Now look around.

01:13:10.932 --> 01:13:12.767
See, what he does

01:13:12.809 --> 01:13:17.188
is he actually draws out the
murder scene before it happens.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:18.773
Now look at this one.

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:21.276
- That's the only one
that hasn't happened yet.

01:13:21.317 --> 01:13:23.153
Exactly.

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:24.571
See what he's gonna do here?

01:13:24.612 --> 01:13:27.741
He's gonna kill four
people at one time,

01:13:27.782 --> 01:13:31.536
and he's gonna do it in
front of an audience.

01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:34.247
[Iceberg] Good work.

01:13:34.289 --> 01:13:37.459
(door latch clanking)

01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:45.133
(door creaking)

01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:46.509
You're a twin?

01:13:49.137 --> 01:13:50.013
No.

01:13:51.306 --> 01:13:52.307
- You obviously
have a fascination

01:13:52.349 --> 01:13:54.768
for people that look alike.

01:13:54.809 --> 01:13:57.103
If you're not a twin,
where did that come from?

01:13:57.145 --> 01:13:59.522
(Donald sighs)

01:14:02.817 --> 01:14:05.904
- My father had a
twin growing up.

01:14:05.945 --> 01:14:10.367
I mean, they were not the
same mother or father,

01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:12.452
different mother,
different father.

01:14:12.494 --> 01:14:14.954
But they were really identical.

01:14:14.996 --> 01:14:16.122
They talked alike.

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:17.624
They walked alike.

01:14:17.665 --> 01:14:19.209
They smiled, alike.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.211
They even dressed alike.

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:24.756
Many people from Kaduna,
where they were from

01:14:24.798 --> 01:14:28.343
really thought they were twins.

01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.387
(plastic container rustling)

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:31.221
Oh.

01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:40.146
After high school, my father
and his best friend decided to,

01:14:40.188 --> 01:14:41.773
they got an admission

01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:44.818
into the Temple University
in Philadelphia.

01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:48.029
So they both moved to America.

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:50.323
After one year in college,

01:14:50.365 --> 01:14:53.535
they met my mother
and her friend,

01:14:53.576 --> 01:14:56.913
who looked exactly
like identical twins,

01:14:58.707 --> 01:15:02.002
but different father,
different mother.

01:15:02.043 --> 01:15:05.171
And my father started
dating my mother

01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:10.719
and my father's friend started
dating my mother's friend.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.388
And since then, all of them,

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.683
all four of them
became so inseparable.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.479
After college my father
married my mother.

01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:22.689
Double wedding?

01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:24.232
Yeah, of course.

01:15:25.692 --> 01:15:28.570
All four of them moved to Texas

01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:32.907
where they would have
nothing but land.

01:15:32.949 --> 01:15:33.783
Mm.

01:15:35.243 --> 01:15:36.369
They wanted their privacy.

01:15:36.411 --> 01:15:37.245
Mm.

01:15:41.416 --> 01:15:43.668
A year after they married,

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:47.672
my father and mother got me

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:52.052
and my father's friend
and my mother's friend

01:15:52.093 --> 01:15:54.220
had a baby boy also.

01:15:54.262 --> 01:15:55.305
Same day?

01:15:55.347 --> 01:15:56.681
Yes, same day.

01:15:58.266 --> 01:15:59.517
Did you look alike?

01:15:59.559 --> 01:16:03.021
- Mm, no.
(Donald laughing)

01:16:03.063 --> 01:16:04.230
No.

01:16:04.272 --> 01:16:06.107
We looked nothing alike.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.611
but our parents were determined

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.238
to make us something
we were not.

01:16:14.949 --> 01:16:15.658
Twins.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.790
Everything he had, I had.

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:25.627
Everything he did I did.

01:16:27.962 --> 01:16:32.759
- [Blessing] So you got used
to seeing two of everything.

01:16:37.305 --> 01:16:38.181
Yes.

01:16:39.307 --> 01:16:41.393
What was his name?

01:16:41.434 --> 01:16:42.894
Take a wild guess.

01:16:44.729 --> 01:16:49.651
- Ronald.
(Donald and Blessing laughing)

01:16:53.405 --> 01:16:55.573
Typical, right?

01:16:55.615 --> 01:16:58.618
Ronald and Donald (laughing).

01:16:58.660 --> 01:17:03.373
- Oh my god, I remember
our last birthday party.

01:17:03.415 --> 01:17:05.458
It was so much fun.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.545
My parents were
huge football fans.

01:17:08.586 --> 01:17:10.088
Football as in soccer, right?

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.172
Nah.

01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:12.465
American football.

01:17:12.507 --> 01:17:13.633
- Mm
- Yeah.

01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:15.969
My father and his best friend

01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:20.432
had followed this American
footballer who was from Nigeria.

01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:23.059
His name was Christian Okoye.

01:17:23.101 --> 01:17:26.146
He was also known as
a Nigerian nightmare.

01:17:26.187 --> 01:17:30.525
And on this particular day,
the same day as our birthday,

01:17:30.567 --> 01:17:32.068
there was a game.

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:35.989
The Philadelphia Eagles were
playing the Atlanta Falcons.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:38.658
So my father and his
doppelganger from Philadelphia,

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:41.703
and my mother and her
doppelganger from Atlanta.

01:17:41.745 --> 01:17:43.830
So they both wore their jerseys.

01:17:43.872 --> 01:17:46.332
There was so much
screaming (laughing),

01:17:46.374 --> 01:17:48.168
so much shouting.

01:17:48.209 --> 01:17:49.627
Wow.

01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:52.130
It was so amazing
to watch a game

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.675
while celebrating our birthday.

01:17:55.717 --> 01:17:56.760
- Mm.
- Ah.

01:17:57.552 --> 01:17:58.678
You felt good about that, huh?

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:00.180
Yeah.

01:18:00.221 --> 01:18:00.847
Yeah, I liked it.

01:18:00.889 --> 01:18:02.349
I really liked it.

01:18:03.725 --> 01:18:06.061
- How old were you
turning at the time?

01:18:06.102 --> 01:18:09.689
- We, we were just just
turning seven that day.

01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:11.358
- Were there a lot of
kids at your party?

01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:14.194
Nah (sighing).

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:18.531
Our parents were
very private people.

01:18:18.573 --> 01:18:21.368
They never really liked to
have a lot of people around us.

01:18:21.409 --> 01:18:24.245
So, (laughs).

01:18:24.287 --> 01:18:26.039
Anyways, on that night,

01:18:27.415 --> 01:18:32.504
my parents put me to bed and
Ronald's parents went home.

01:18:32.545 --> 01:18:33.463
So I waited.

01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:36.883
Waited for what?

01:18:36.925 --> 01:18:40.470
- My parents and Ronald's
parents used to do stuff

01:18:40.512 --> 01:18:43.598
downstairs in the living room.

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:46.101
[Blessing] Stuff Like what?

01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:48.520
Drugs,

01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:49.396
parties,

01:18:50.355 --> 01:18:51.272
sex.

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.900
My dad kissing Ronald's dad.

01:18:53.942 --> 01:18:56.277
My mom kissing Ronald's mom.

01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.572
And on this fateful night,

01:18:59.614 --> 01:19:01.700
I knew they were
gonna be doing stuff.

01:19:01.741 --> 01:19:05.787
So I snuck out of my
bedroom and I went to watch.

01:19:06.996 --> 01:19:09.749
- [Blessing] What
were they doing?

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:12.293
They were talking.

01:19:12.335 --> 01:19:14.129
[Blessing] About what?

01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:18.800
(plastic container rustling)

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:22.429
They wanted more children,

01:19:23.972 --> 01:19:27.434
but they wanted them to look
more like Ronald's parents

01:19:27.475 --> 01:19:29.811
and nothing like me or Ronald.

01:19:32.188 --> 01:19:36.526
They, they wanted to get rid
of us and start all over.

01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:44.117
- [Blessing] Get,
get rid of you, how?

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:47.620
- They were gonna kill us
that night in our sleep

01:19:47.662 --> 01:19:49.998
and bury our bodies
in the woods.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:53.793
So it seems like we
never even existed.

01:19:53.835 --> 01:19:56.463
[Blessing] Oh my God.

01:19:56.504 --> 01:19:57.839
What did you do?

01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:07.974
- I snuck out of the
window in my bedroom.

01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.351
I went to Ronald's bedroom.

01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:10.852
I tried to warn him.

01:20:13.104 --> 01:20:15.607
There was just so much blood.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.361
So much blood everywhere.

01:20:22.572 --> 01:20:24.949
His father was stabbing him.

01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:27.952
He was crying.

01:20:29.496 --> 01:20:33.917
He was screaming, begging
for his mom to help him,

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.881
but she never came.

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.261
He was just a boy.

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:54.646
Anyway, that was the last time
I saw Ronald or my parents.

01:20:58.358 --> 01:21:03.822
- [Blessing] So that's why you
hate people who look alike.

01:21:03.863 --> 01:21:04.364
Yeah.

01:21:05.115 --> 01:21:08.243
(car engine roaring)

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.250
(upbeat music)

01:21:24.926 --> 01:21:27.721
* I got my fly
dress on tonight.

01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:29.055
* Waiting on your text

01:21:29.097 --> 01:21:31.725
* I bet you're gonna sweat

01:21:31.766 --> 01:21:38.064
* Kiss me on my neck
when we connect at six you won't regret

01:21:38.106 --> 01:21:41.234
* I just can't wait
to get to you

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:44.404
* Cause we're gonna
see if you like me

01:21:44.446 --> 01:21:47.073
* Like I like you,
baby here's a clue

01:21:47.115 --> 01:21:52.746
* I want you to hurry to me

01:21:52.787 --> 01:21:54.789
* Give me what cha got

01:21:54.831 --> 01:21:57.917
* I got what you need

01:21:57.959 --> 01:22:01.254
- I've seen you before.
* Give me what cha got

01:22:01.296 --> 01:22:05.050
- * I got what you need
- I like to watch you sing

01:22:05.091 --> 01:22:06.551
* Give me what cha got

01:22:06.593 --> 01:22:08.178
Are you hear with anyone?

01:22:08.219 --> 01:22:11.014
- *I got what you need
- No I came here for you

01:22:11.056 --> 01:22:14.142
- * I'm about to make you mine
- Good.

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:16.353
Cause I am not willing
to play any game, yeah.

01:22:16.394 --> 01:22:18.938
I like to get to what
I want straight away.

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:20.231
What do you want?

01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:25.820
* You got no clue what
I wanna do, please you

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:28.656
* Give me what cha got

01:22:28.698 --> 01:22:31.868
* I got what you need

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:34.621
* Give me what cha got

01:22:34.662 --> 01:22:37.999
* I got what you need

01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:41.127
* I'm about to make you mine

01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:44.130
* I'm yours for life

01:22:44.172 --> 01:22:47.175
(crickets chirping)

01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:51.680
(lips smacking)

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:56.142
Baby, I missed you so much.

01:22:56.184 --> 01:22:59.229
- I know, I know,
I missed you too.

01:23:00.188 --> 01:23:02.607
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:02.649 --> 01:23:03.483
I'm sorry.

01:23:03.525 --> 01:23:04.359
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:07.821
Where are you Going?

01:23:07.862 --> 01:23:09.781
You can't leave me out here.

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:11.366
Are you bloody mad?

01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:26.256
(door clicking)

01:23:26.297 --> 01:23:27.882
- I'm looking for
Special Agent Revis.

01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:29.592
I was told he might be here.

01:23:29.634 --> 01:23:30.635
He's here.

01:23:30.677 --> 01:23:32.262
Is he expecting you?

01:23:32.303 --> 01:23:34.514
- Um, no ma'am,
he's not, I just.

01:23:34.556 --> 01:23:36.182
Wait a minute.

01:23:36.224 --> 01:23:38.727
You're that news reporter.

01:23:38.768 --> 01:23:40.520
Iceberg.

01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:41.980
What's up, man?

01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:44.190
Uh, you got some
information on the new case?

01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:48.028
No, I just (sighs)

01:23:48.069 --> 01:23:51.072
I keep seeing her
everywhere I turn.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.366
- We were just about
to have dinner.

01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:56.578
Would you like to come inside?

01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:57.537
[Iceberg] Sure.

01:23:57.579 --> 01:23:58.413
Come on.

01:24:08.048 --> 01:24:11.926
- Uh, is this how
y'all normally eat?

01:24:11.968 --> 01:24:14.304
All the time.

01:24:14.346 --> 01:24:15.597
- Yeah, I don't think I
should be witnessing this.

01:24:15.638 --> 01:24:16.806
I'm gonna go.

01:24:16.848 --> 01:24:18.933
No, no, don't leave.

01:24:18.975 --> 01:24:21.644
I have so many more questions.

01:24:21.686 --> 01:24:23.188
About what, the case?

01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:25.565
About your partner.

01:24:25.607 --> 01:24:29.486
You see, I think he's the
most loving, loyal, playful,

01:24:29.527 --> 01:24:33.239
yet wise and mature
man I have ever met.

01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:35.283
And I want to know
what you think.

01:24:35.325 --> 01:24:36.159
Why?

01:24:37.285 --> 01:24:38.536
Because I'm afraid

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:41.623
that this is all just
some type of mirage.

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:52.258
- Damn Iceberg, you aint got
no, no words to say about me?

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.718
I think the world of you, man.

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.386
He does.

01:24:56.763 --> 01:24:59.099
- Honestly Revis, all I
can think about is my wife

01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:01.184
and whatever it is she's
going through right now.

01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:03.395
Do you think about death?

01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:04.562
Death?

01:25:04.604 --> 01:25:05.522
Like her death?

01:25:05.563 --> 01:25:06.231
No.

01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:08.400
Like what if you die?

01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:10.485
You see most people when
they think about love,

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:13.321
they think about today on Earth.

01:25:13.363 --> 01:25:18.785
But if you die, who would
you love in the afterlife?

01:25:18.827 --> 01:25:20.620
You see, even in death.

01:25:20.662 --> 01:25:23.164
I believe I would
want to be with him.

01:25:23.206 --> 01:25:26.209
That's how incredible
I think he is.

01:25:26.251 --> 01:25:27.877
- Well I certainly wouldn't
wanna be stuck with him

01:25:27.919 --> 01:25:29.170
in the afterlife?

01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:33.133
All right.

01:25:33.174 --> 01:25:35.260
As far as a man goes,

01:25:35.301 --> 01:25:37.804
I don't think you could
have done any better.

01:25:37.846 --> 01:25:39.848
(Joanne chuckles lightly)

01:25:39.889 --> 01:25:41.182
I'm gonna go.

01:25:44.894 --> 01:25:47.439
(car horn honking)

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.024
(lips smacking against skin)

01:25:49.065 --> 01:25:50.692
Ooh, whoop whoop.

01:25:51.901 --> 01:25:52.986
(Revis and Joanne chuckling)

01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:54.696
Had to pull you over there.

01:25:54.738 --> 01:25:56.531
You know, why don't you?

01:25:57.741 --> 01:25:58.825
Ass too fat.

01:26:03.955 --> 01:26:06.750
(phone ringing)

01:26:06.791 --> 01:26:09.252
(Revis sighing)

01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.092
Iceberg, go ahead.

01:26:16.134 --> 01:26:19.596
- [Iceberg] Donald
Keller was married.

01:26:19.637 --> 01:26:20.764
I'm on my way.

01:26:27.645 --> 01:26:30.607
- I thought you
were on your way.

01:26:30.648 --> 01:26:31.441
I am.

01:26:31.483 --> 01:26:32.901
Mm.

01:26:32.942 --> 01:26:35.695
(dramatic music)

01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:40.950
What's your favorite movie?

01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:43.119
[Iceberg] Excuse me?

01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:44.788
Your favorite movie.

01:26:44.829 --> 01:26:45.538
What is it?

01:26:46.748 --> 01:26:47.624
[Iceberg] Mrs. Fontaine.

01:26:47.665 --> 01:26:48.875
Call me Deborah,

01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:50.794
and I'm not answering
any of your questions

01:26:50.835 --> 01:26:55.048
until you tell me what's
your favorite movie?

01:26:55.090 --> 01:26:56.257
Yep, yes, yes.

01:26:56.299 --> 01:26:57.550
Miss Deborah, ma'am,

01:26:57.592 --> 01:27:00.679
we'll, tell tell you
our favorite movie.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.346
Um,

01:27:02.722 --> 01:27:03.932
The Godfather.

01:27:05.767 --> 01:27:07.727
Mm, figures.

01:27:07.769 --> 01:27:12.190
Can't Go wrong with
The Godfather, right?

01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:15.235
- Beauty and the
Breasts, Beasts.

01:27:15.276 --> 01:27:18.863
Beauty and The Beast, some
of Disney's finest work.

01:27:18.905 --> 01:27:19.948
You think so?

01:27:19.989 --> 01:27:21.157
Ab, absolutely.

01:27:21.199 --> 01:27:22.325
Chef's Kiss (smacks lips).

01:27:22.367 --> 01:27:23.410
- Deborah...
- My favorite movie

01:27:23.451 --> 01:27:25.453
is Basic Instinct.

01:27:25.495 --> 01:27:27.872
I watch it every night
before I go to bed.

01:27:27.914 --> 01:27:31.042
I think to myself what it would
be like to be Sharon Stone

01:27:31.084 --> 01:27:32.752
in that situation.

01:27:32.794 --> 01:27:33.920
Mm, you know?

01:27:35.338 --> 01:27:38.925
- Oh, you obsess.
- Oh, my Netflix and chill.

01:27:38.967 --> 01:27:39.884
Nope, mm.

01:27:39.926 --> 01:27:40.927
No thank you.

01:27:40.969 --> 01:27:42.262
(Revis growling)

01:27:42.303 --> 01:27:43.555
[Iceberg] Nope.

01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:44.931
Nope.
(Revis clearing throat)

01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:45.765
No thank you.

01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:47.434
(Deborah giggles)

01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:50.103
- Okay, you can ask
your questions now.

01:27:50.145 --> 01:27:52.105
Donald Keller?

01:27:52.147 --> 01:27:55.108
- My baby girl's
psycho ex-husband?

01:27:55.150 --> 01:27:57.068
- What can you
tell us about him?

01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:58.820
I could tell you everything.

01:27:58.862 --> 01:28:01.031
Starting with the fact
that he's a nut job.

01:28:01.072 --> 01:28:02.490
What do you mean?

01:28:02.532 --> 01:28:05.201
- Well, he has to have
two of everything.

01:28:05.243 --> 01:28:07.495
If that wasn't weird enough,

01:28:07.537 --> 01:28:10.582
he had a violent side
like nobody's business.

01:28:10.623 --> 01:28:11.916
- Wait a minute, we
researched this guy.

01:28:11.958 --> 01:28:13.126
He had no history of viol,

01:28:13.168 --> 01:28:15.295
of a violent past.

01:28:15.337 --> 01:28:17.630
- That's because he's
too smart to be obvious.

01:28:17.672 --> 01:28:20.550
And that's what made
him so dangerous.

01:28:20.592 --> 01:28:22.385
I even told her to get a
psychiatrist, you know,

01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:24.179
to help her mentally

01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:26.598
and a restraining
order out against him.

01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:28.475
That was some good advice.

01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:32.395
- I watched a lot of Dr.
Phil and Oprah that day.

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:34.397
- So I understand
the psychiatrist,

01:28:34.439 --> 01:28:37.317
but why did you feel a
restraining order was necessary?

01:28:37.359 --> 01:28:38.276
(dramatic music)

01:28:38.318 --> 01:28:39.944
KK was pregnant

01:28:39.986 --> 01:28:42.447
and she was planning
on getting an abortion.

01:28:42.489 --> 01:28:44.115
And we knew if
Donald ever found out

01:28:44.157 --> 01:28:46.451
that he would try to kill her.

01:28:46.493 --> 01:28:48.953
Well, she was determined
to have the abortion,

01:28:48.995 --> 01:28:50.830
so she asked me to look into it.

01:28:50.872 --> 01:28:52.165
I didn't wanna do it.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.167
I don't even believe
in abortions.

01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:55.919
But KK was so afraid.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.587
So I did it.

01:28:57.629 --> 01:29:00.674
And I found a really good
doctor right here in Houston.

01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:03.343
There were some complications
with the surgery.

01:29:03.385 --> 01:29:06.096
And my baby died
with her babies.

01:29:07.931 --> 01:29:09.265
[Iceberg] Babies?

01:29:09.307 --> 01:29:10.892
She was aborting twins.

01:29:10.934 --> 01:29:11.559
Oh shit.

01:29:13.353 --> 01:29:15.355
And you blamed the doctor?

01:29:15.397 --> 01:29:17.857
I blamed the whole system.

01:29:17.899 --> 01:29:19.109
Donald blamed the doctor.

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:22.487
(dramatic upbeat music)

01:29:26.991 --> 01:29:29.536
(phone ringing)

01:29:30.370 --> 01:29:31.329
Special Agent Sparks.

01:29:31.371 --> 01:29:32.997
How can I help you?

01:29:33.039 --> 01:29:34.791
- [Iceberg] Kamille
Keller, two K, two Ls,

01:29:34.833 --> 01:29:36.543
had an abortion
over ten years ago.

01:29:36.584 --> 01:29:37.752
That was around the same time

01:29:37.794 --> 01:29:39.546
that DGK's first
victim went missing.

01:29:39.587 --> 01:29:41.673
I need to know where she
went to have that abortion

01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:44.050
and who was the doctor
that performed the surgery?

01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:45.385
Is that it?

01:29:45.427 --> 01:29:46.219
[Iceberg] That's it.

01:29:46.261 --> 01:29:47.470
I'm on it.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.727
(birds chirping)
(car engine humming)

01:30:05.155 --> 01:30:06.364
(car door slamming)

01:30:06.406 --> 01:30:07.741
(fly buzzing)

01:30:07.782 --> 01:30:10.493
(bird squawking)

01:30:18.293 --> 01:30:19.711
You must be our new neighbor.

01:30:19.753 --> 01:30:21.129
Oh, yes.

01:30:21.171 --> 01:30:23.256
- I was wondering who bought
the house across the street.

01:30:23.298 --> 01:30:24.257
I'm Tess.

01:30:24.299 --> 01:30:25.342
Hi Tess.

01:30:25.383 --> 01:30:26.509
I'm Donald.

01:30:27.302 --> 01:30:28.303
Nice to meet you, Donald.

01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:29.429
Welcome to the neighborhood.

01:30:29.471 --> 01:30:30.555
- Thank you.
- You have a nice day.

01:30:30.597 --> 01:30:32.557
You too, now, Tess.

01:30:33.224 --> 01:30:36.561
(car door slams shut)

01:30:36.603 --> 01:30:39.689
(car engine roaring)

01:30:48.615 --> 01:30:51.659
(ominous music)

01:31:18.269 --> 01:31:21.022
(phone ringing)

01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:23.733
[Iceberg] Go.

01:31:23.775 --> 01:31:25.694
Kamille Keller had an abortion

01:31:25.735 --> 01:31:30.156
at the old abortion and
safety house on Old Mill Road.

01:31:30.198 --> 01:31:32.867
The doctor was Todd Sellers

01:31:32.909 --> 01:31:36.329
and he's at 1414 Autobahn
Road, Houston, Texas.

01:31:36.371 --> 01:31:38.873
(upbeat music)

01:31:47.215 --> 01:31:50.677
(police siren wailing)

01:31:51.803 --> 01:31:52.929
Todd!

01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:54.431
I was so worried.

01:31:54.472 --> 01:31:56.349
I found the front door
wide open when I got home

01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:57.434
and you were
nowhere to be found,

01:31:57.475 --> 01:31:59.936
I thought that DGK
guy had got you.

01:31:59.978 --> 01:32:03.189
Why are you dressed
like an FBI agent?

01:32:06.693 --> 01:32:08.862
So you're not my
husband, you're FBI?

01:32:08.903 --> 01:32:09.571
No ma'am.

01:32:09.612 --> 01:32:10.405
I'm not your husband.

01:32:10.447 --> 01:32:12.365
But you look just like him.

01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:14.451
Todd, are you playing with me?

01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:15.702
Are you serious?

01:32:15.744 --> 01:32:17.370
Like I was genuinely
worried about you.

01:32:17.412 --> 01:32:18.788
[Iceberg] Mrs. Sellers,

01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:20.665
I assure you that I'm
not joking with you.

01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:23.668
My name is Special
Agent John Rollins.

01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:28.882
Well, special agent.

01:32:28.923 --> 01:32:32.802
Is this my husband or am
I going fucking crazy?

01:32:32.844 --> 01:32:36.181
(man thudding on floor)

01:32:40.977 --> 01:32:43.521
(Donald sighing)

01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:48.777
(door slamming)
(latch clacking)

01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:02.832
(door rattling)

01:33:06.378 --> 01:33:09.089
(door slamming)

01:33:21.309 --> 01:33:23.436
You need something?

01:33:23.478 --> 01:33:24.646
Who is that?

01:33:26.147 --> 01:33:27.732
[Donald] Todd?

01:33:29.025 --> 01:33:32.070
- Why does Todd look
like my husband?

01:33:32.112 --> 01:33:35.198
- Todd Seller, is
a medical doctor

01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.409
who specializes in abortions.

01:33:42.789 --> 01:33:46.626
You see, he has always
been on my list,

01:33:46.668 --> 01:33:49.170
but I just wasn't
ready for him yet.

01:33:49.212 --> 01:33:51.172
I needed to get
you out of the way.

01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:54.676
But then something
miraculously happened.

01:33:54.718 --> 01:33:56.803
I was watching TV

01:33:56.845 --> 01:34:01.182
and I saw your husband
was searching for me.

01:34:01.224 --> 01:34:02.308
(fingers snapping)

01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:03.893
And then it clicked.

01:34:03.935 --> 01:34:04.769
Huh?

01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:14.738
Eagles and Falcons.

01:34:17.198 --> 01:34:19.075
Birds of prey.

01:34:19.117 --> 01:34:19.743
Aha.

01:34:22.203 --> 01:34:26.499
- Come on, Dr. Rollins,
I'm sure as a psychologist,

01:34:26.541 --> 01:34:28.501
you must appreciate the synergy

01:34:28.543 --> 01:34:30.712
in this perfect piece of art.

01:34:33.465 --> 01:34:39.304
The women painted like eagles
and men painted like falcons.

01:34:39.346 --> 01:34:41.097
Wow.

01:34:41.139 --> 01:34:42.098
Ha, I love it.

01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:46.227
I even brought you wings.

01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:52.359
(laughing) I am so excited.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.028
I can't wait to start.

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:56.821
You're artistically recreating

01:34:56.863 --> 01:35:00.158
the last birthday party
with your parents?

01:35:04.412 --> 01:35:05.330
Yes.

01:35:07.415 --> 01:35:09.417
So, so this Dr. Todd,

01:35:11.127 --> 01:35:14.172
he was your original
target and not my husband.

01:35:14.214 --> 01:35:15.048
Yeah,

01:35:16.925 --> 01:35:19.094
but you see your husband,

01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:25.725
let's call it bad luck or
perfect genes or bad timing.

01:35:25.767 --> 01:35:28.269
He just appeared on my radar.

01:35:29.562 --> 01:35:31.690
They look alike, don't they?

01:35:31.731 --> 01:35:34.025
Okay, so then why am I here?

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.533
Ten Years ago

01:35:43.118 --> 01:35:48.832
you counseled a certain young
lady, Ms. Kamille Keller,

01:35:48.873 --> 01:35:52.127
and you advised her
to commit an abortion.

01:35:54.546 --> 01:35:56.089
I would never do that though.

01:35:56.131 --> 01:35:57.173
Yes, you did!

01:35:58.758 --> 01:36:01.344
You were her counselor.

01:36:01.386 --> 01:36:02.470
You advised her.

01:36:03.805 --> 01:36:07.225
She took your counsel
and aborted my babies!

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.438
My,

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:14.315
my twins.

01:36:18.611 --> 01:36:20.947
and it happened in his clinic.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:25.827
On his abortion table!

01:36:31.291 --> 01:36:32.375
My twin babies.

01:36:36.588 --> 01:36:38.757
Ten years ago.

01:36:38.798 --> 01:36:40.300
Kamille, Kamille, Kamille.

01:36:40.342 --> 01:36:41.468
Kam, KK.

01:36:41.509 --> 01:36:43.928
KK is Kamille Keller,
wait, wait, wait.

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:48.016
She, she was being
abused by her husband.

01:36:48.058 --> 01:36:51.644
(sobbing) That
was you wasn't it?

01:36:51.686 --> 01:36:52.771
She didn't know whether or not

01:36:52.812 --> 01:36:53.980
she wanted to have her babies.

01:36:54.022 --> 01:36:55.857
She, she wasn't in the
right frame of mind,

01:36:55.899 --> 01:36:57.859
but I didn't tell her
to have an abortion.

01:36:57.901 --> 01:37:00.195
- I told her...
- Yes you did!

01:37:01.446 --> 01:37:03.156
What about me?

01:37:03.198 --> 01:37:05.617
Does my choice
not matter at all?

01:37:05.658 --> 01:37:07.911
You weren't my patient.

01:37:35.313 --> 01:37:40.026
- Dr. Blessing. Rollins, you
have been sentenced to death.

01:37:44.572 --> 01:37:49.619
You both must prepare yourself
now for the day of reckoning.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:52.664
(hands clapping) I can't wait.

01:37:52.706 --> 01:37:55.417
(Donald laughing)

01:37:55.458 --> 01:37:56.876
I can't wait

01:37:56.918 --> 01:37:59.379
(Donald sighing)

01:37:59.421 --> 01:38:02.382
(Donald whistling)

01:38:02.424 --> 01:38:04.843
- Let me out.
(banging on glass door)

01:38:04.884 --> 01:38:06.219
Let out of here.

01:38:07.762 --> 01:38:08.930
Let me out.

01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:13.143
(Blessing sobbing)

01:38:16.896 --> 01:38:18.106
Open the door.

01:38:20.025 --> 01:38:21.276
Open the door.

01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:26.614
Open the door.
(Donald whistling)

01:38:28.199 --> 01:38:33.079
(Blessing banging on door)
(Donald continues whistling)

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:42.005
(Blessing grunting)

01:38:57.437 --> 01:39:02.484
(car engine humming)
(Heavy base music)

01:39:11.576 --> 01:39:14.662
(mid tempo music)

01:39:14.704 --> 01:39:16.873
* Yeah

01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:20.710

* Obviously, this stays

01:39:37.769 --> 01:39:40.438
* Let's make this complete

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:44.234

01:39:44.275 --> 01:39:47.987

01:39:56.788 --> 01:39:58.998

01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.169
* I find me where I wanna be

01:40:03.211 --> 01:40:05.463
* No questions about
it, no doubt about it

01:40:05.505 --> 01:40:10.093
* I think that you're the
right ones in here for me.

01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:11.761
* I could be shy my way

01:40:11.803 --> 01:40:16.808
* Hold back the fact that I'm
amused by you in all ways

01:40:18.393 --> 01:40:19.644
* Don't think I'm pushing
but I've been looking

01:40:19.686 --> 01:40:24.315
* Now its time for me to
be directly straight

01:40:24.357 --> 01:40:28.361
* Boy, I want you just
as bad you want me

01:40:28.403 --> 01:40:32.240

* Let's make this complete

01:40:54.095 --> 01:40:59.225
* Clearly I want you

01:41:01.227 --> 01:41:06.274
* Clearly I want you

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:11.821
* Clearly I want you

01:41:22.123 --> 01:41:23.792
What the fuck?

01:41:23.833 --> 01:41:25.001
He's got a gun!

01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:25.960

01:41:26.002 --> 01:41:26.920

01:41:42.936 --> 01:41:46.147

[Woman 5] (moaning) Oh, yeah.

01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:04.290
- FBI, put your
hands in the air!

01:42:04.332 --> 01:42:06.960
- Oh, uh.

01:42:07.002 --> 01:42:07.794
I don't know, um.

01:42:07.836 --> 01:42:08.628
What the fuck indeed

01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:10.046
Um I'm sorry ladies.

01:42:10.088 --> 01:42:12.799
You may wanna stay
in here for a while.

01:42:12.841 --> 01:42:15.802
No shit, that was our plan.

01:42:15.844 --> 01:42:19.973
- It's my plan too, but you
ladies enjoy yourselves.

01:42:20.015 --> 01:42:22.142
[Jaleece] Close the door.

01:42:22.183 --> 01:42:24.310
- I'm closing, I'm here.

01:42:24.352 --> 01:42:27.689

01:42:43.371 --> 01:42:44.706
Is anyone in there?

01:42:44.748 --> 01:42:45.957
I Think so.

01:42:45.999 --> 01:42:48.168
Has anybody advised on Jaleece?

01:42:48.209 --> 01:42:49.002
You can say that?

01:42:49.044 --> 01:42:50.837
Go back and watch her.

01:42:50.879 --> 01:42:53.131
Don't let her outta your sight.

01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:54.424
What you gonna do about him?

01:42:54.466 --> 01:42:57.385
- I'm gonna find out why
he's running from us.

01:42:57.427 --> 01:42:57.927
Okay.

01:42:59.012 --> 01:42:59.888
Hey Mark.

I know that's you, man.

01:43:02.891 --> 01:43:03.850
I need you to exit the vehicle.

01:43:03.892 --> 01:43:04.893
Let see your hands.

01:43:04.934 --> 01:43:05.727
(car engine roaring)

01:43:05.769 --> 01:43:06.853
Mark.

01:43:06.895 --> 01:43:08.563

01:45:07.098 --> 01:45:09.267
Let's make this easy.

01:45:09.309 --> 01:45:11.853
Just come out with
your hands up.

01:45:27.035 --> 01:45:27.869
Come on, man.

01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:31.831
Right there, stop right there.

01:45:31.873 --> 01:45:33.416
He killed her.

01:45:35.418 --> 01:45:36.753
- He said...

01:45:36.795 --> 01:45:38.421

her, but he kill her anyway.

01:47:48.176 --> 01:47:49.552
Revis?

01:47:49.594 --> 01:47:53.014
I know I promised that
I'll never do this,

01:47:53.056 --> 01:47:56.142
but you promised that you
will never stay out all night

01:47:56.184 --> 01:47:58.061
without calling me first.

01:48:01.022 --> 01:48:02.607
You better be safe.

01:48:05.568 --> 01:48:08.613
(dramatic music)

01:48:09.531 --> 01:48:12.075
[Asa] Joanne, it's Asa.

01:48:12.117 --> 01:48:13.326
Not right now, Asa.

01:48:13.368 --> 01:48:14.452
- [Asa] Sources
are confirming that

01:48:14.494 --> 01:48:15.203
- Special Agent Revis

- What?
- Currently on scene.

01:48:18.707 --> 01:48:20.709
Joanne, did you hear me?

01:48:22.127 --> 01:48:25.088
(Jaleece groaning)

01:48:25.130 --> 01:48:27.799
(door creaking)

01:48:42.188 --> 01:48:45.942
(Jaleece and Blessing sobbing)

01:48:47.318 --> 01:48:49.362
- You knew Donald Keller was
DGK all along didn't you?

01:48:49.404 --> 01:48:50.405
No, I did not.

01:48:50.447 --> 01:48:52.073
He was at your private event.

01:48:52.115 --> 01:48:53.366
With Paislee.

01:48:53.408 --> 01:48:55.201
You showcased his artwork.

01:48:55.243 --> 01:48:56.619
I didn't know it was his.

01:48:56.661 --> 01:48:58.788
Paislee was my friend,
she begged me hang it.

01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:00.290
I would've done
anything for her.

01:49:00.331 --> 01:49:02.500
- And distracting the FBI so
he could grab another victim.

01:49:02.542 --> 01:49:04.210
How do you explain that?

01:49:04.252 --> 01:49:05.420
He was waiting in my gallery.

01:49:05.462 --> 01:49:07.213
I don't know how
he got in there.

01:49:07.255 --> 01:49:08.506
He was in there with Margo May.

01:49:08.548 --> 01:49:09.424
She was sitting in the chair.

01:49:09.466 --> 01:49:11.301
He had a gun to her head.

01:49:11.343 --> 01:49:11.926
Did you see him?

01:49:11.968 --> 01:49:12.761
Yes.

01:49:12.802 --> 01:49:14.763
Is this what you saw?

01:49:18.099 --> 01:49:19.225
That's him.

01:49:19.267 --> 01:49:22.020
(dramatic music)

01:49:48.672 --> 01:49:51.049
- He said we were
gonna play a game.

01:49:51.091 --> 01:49:52.759
If he wins, we live.

01:49:53.718 --> 01:49:55.637
If he loses, she dies.

01:49:56.971 --> 01:49:57.847
What game?

01:49:59.641 --> 01:50:01.851
- I was to go to
Bill's Soul Food Cafe

01:50:01.893 --> 01:50:03.645
and sit in the front row.

01:50:03.687 --> 01:50:05.980
When the band finishes their
final song of the night.

01:50:06.022 --> 01:50:08.441
I was to get up and exit
out of the back door.

01:50:08.483 --> 01:50:10.568
If I see anybody following me.

01:50:10.610 --> 01:50:12.487
I was to take off running.

01:50:12.529 --> 01:50:13.947
There would be a car
waiting out back.

01:50:13.988 --> 01:50:15.156
I was to get in and lay low

01:50:15.198 --> 01:50:17.492
until he called and
told me to drive.

01:50:17.534 --> 01:50:18.660
I was so terrified

01:50:18.702 --> 01:50:21.162
I didn't even see
Margo in the back seat.

01:50:21.204 --> 01:50:23.289
When he finally called, I
didn't even think about it.

01:50:23.331 --> 01:50:24.874
I just took off.

01:50:24.916 --> 01:50:28.253
Until I looked in
the rear view mirror.

01:50:28.294 --> 01:50:29.963
He killed her.

01:50:30.005 --> 01:50:33.383
I did everything he told me to
do and he killed her anyway,

01:50:33.425 --> 01:50:34.968
so I stopped driving.

01:50:36.136 --> 01:50:37.178
(dramatic music)

01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:38.555
And,

01:50:38.596 --> 01:50:40.306
he told me to give
you a message.

01:50:40.348 --> 01:50:41.474
What message?

01:50:41.516 --> 01:50:44.185
It's in my inside coat pocket.

01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:59.242
(woman sobbing)
(Donald humming)

01:51:26.394 --> 01:51:28.563
(dramatic music continues)

01:51:28.605 --> 01:51:30.774
You need to stop crying.

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:34.903
You're going to ruin the art.

01:51:39.324 --> 01:51:40.408
I'm sorry.

01:51:43.161 --> 01:51:44.496
Thank you.

01:51:44.537 --> 01:51:45.830
Special agent John Rollins,

01:51:45.872 --> 01:51:47.749
you're cordially invited
to an art celebration,

01:51:47.791 --> 01:51:51.461
10:00 PM 8805 on Clarke
Road, Lewis, Texas.

01:51:51.503 --> 01:51:54.381
Come alone or your
wife dies, DGK.

01:51:54.422 --> 01:51:55.090
8 8 0 5?

01:51:56.383 --> 01:51:59.719
That's an abandoned abortion
clinic and safe house.

01:51:59.761 --> 01:52:01.680
Yeah, women used
to come to Houston

01:52:01.721 --> 01:52:02.889
and stay at the safe house

01:52:02.931 --> 01:52:05.058
till their number was
called for surgery.

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.519
Back then, you could
make arrangements

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:09.396
and stay the night
if you wanted to.

01:52:09.437 --> 01:52:11.231
That was Roe v Wade central,

01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:14.818
large crowds would come and
riot, picket, foul language.

01:52:14.859 --> 01:52:16.569
It was crazy.

01:52:16.611 --> 01:52:18.905
A few years ago someone
bought that property

01:52:18.947 --> 01:52:20.323
and now it's just empty.

01:52:20.365 --> 01:52:21.825
It's just there.

01:52:21.866 --> 01:52:23.702
DGK is there.

01:52:23.743 --> 01:52:24.411
- I'll alert the team.
- Good.

01:52:24.452 --> 01:52:25.912
You alert the team.

01:52:25.954 --> 01:52:26.538
I'm gonna go find my wife.
(hand banging on desk)

01:52:26.579 --> 01:52:28.248
(sirens wailing)

01:52:28.289 --> 01:52:31.042
(dramatic music)

01:52:40.844 --> 01:52:43.930
(crickets chirping)

01:52:47.684 --> 01:52:50.437
[Crowd] DGK, DGK, DGK, DGK, DGK.

01:52:55.483 --> 01:52:59.112

01:52:59.154 --> 01:53:01.823
(sirens wailing)

01:53:07.328 --> 01:53:10.582
(car door slamming shut)

01:53:11.791 --> 01:53:13.335

01:53:31.311 --> 01:53:31.895

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:34.731
[Crowd] Whoa!

01:53:34.773 --> 01:53:37.525
(crowd cheering)

01:53:45.533 --> 01:53:48.912
(dramatic whooshing)

01:53:48.953 --> 01:53:52.957
- Welcome, welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:53:52.999 --> 01:53:54.876
I am your host, DGK!

01:54:01.007 --> 01:54:02.717

my invitation.

01:54:12.018 --> 01:54:13.937
DGK, DGK, DGK!

01:54:13.978 --> 01:54:16.064
Hoping to see you wife?

01:54:17.899 --> 01:54:20.402

01:54:20.443 --> 01:54:22.028

01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:23.530
- with your baby killing wife.
- DGK, DGK, DGK, DGK!

01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:27.826
- Any moment now (laughing).
- DGK, DGK, DGK, DGK!

01:54:27.867 --> 01:54:29.828

01:54:29.869 --> 01:54:31.413
Enjoy the show.

01:54:31.454 --> 01:54:34.207
(crowd chanting)

01:54:40.922 --> 01:54:43.008
[Crowd] Whoa!

01:54:43.049 --> 01:54:44.217
[Crowd] Wow!

01:54:53.435 --> 01:54:56.271

01:55:01.276 --> 01:55:02.152
[Crowd] DGK!

01:55:02.193 --> 01:55:02.736

01:55:02.777 --> 01:55:04.320

01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:07.407
DGK!

01:55:07.449 --> 01:55:08.783
DGK!

01:55:08.825 --> 01:55:09.659
DGK!

01:55:10.785 --> 01:55:11.870

01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:12.954
DGK!

01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:15.373
DGK!

01:55:15.415 --> 01:55:16.041
DGK!

01:55:17.625 --> 01:55:18.752

01:55:18.793 --> 01:55:19.627

01:55:20.712 --> 01:55:23.631
(people screaming)

01:55:31.556 --> 01:55:34.476
(Donald groaning)

01:55:35.852 --> 01:55:37.395
[Crowd] DGK!

01:55:37.437 --> 01:55:38.772
DGK!

01:55:38.813 --> 01:55:41.566
(dramatic music)

01:55:49.741 --> 01:55:52.619
(car door slamming)

01:55:56.706 --> 01:55:58.667
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:55:59.834 --> 01:56:02.003
Are you enjoying the show?

01:56:02.045 --> 01:56:05.298
(Donald laughing)

01:56:05.340 --> 01:56:09.636
Let me show you how DGK works.
(crowd cheering)

01:56:09.678 --> 01:56:12.055
(gentle music)

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.811
Your eyes are opening.

01:56:17.852 --> 01:56:19.771
That's good.

01:56:19.813 --> 01:56:21.773
I need you awake for this.

01:56:24.901 --> 01:56:27.404
I know you are wondering,

01:56:27.445 --> 01:56:30.657
why does DGK kill
innocent people?

01:56:30.699 --> 01:56:32.575
How does he do it

01:56:32.617 --> 01:56:36.788
and why does he choose to
body paint his victims?

01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:39.708
(crowd continues cheering)

01:56:39.749 --> 01:56:42.752
And the answers are very simple.

01:56:42.794 --> 01:56:46.423
First of all, there is no one
who has incurred wrath of DGK

01:56:46.464 --> 01:56:47.799
who is innocent.

01:56:47.841 --> 01:56:50.051
And every one of my victims

01:56:51.386 --> 01:56:54.389
are murderers of
innocent children.

01:56:55.473 --> 01:56:58.476
- So, you doing this
for the children?

01:57:00.145 --> 01:57:01.855
I'm doing this for humanity.

01:57:01.896 --> 01:57:04.524
(Iceberg laughing)

01:57:06.568 --> 01:57:09.821
- [Man 5] Yeah, you, back it
up, back it on outta here.

01:57:09.863 --> 01:57:10.739
[Man 6] Do me a favor, please.

01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.407
Please help me out.

01:57:12.449 --> 01:57:15.869
(gentle music)
(Iceberg grunting)

01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:18.204
You see, Ten years ago,

01:57:20.707 --> 01:57:22.500
my wife had an abortion

01:57:24.085 --> 01:57:27.589
and it happened on this
exact spot where I stand.

01:57:29.716 --> 01:57:31.051
You see there are
many people out there

01:57:31.092 --> 01:57:32.010
who look like other people

01:57:32.052 --> 01:57:33.553
who just love to kill babies

01:57:33.595 --> 01:57:37.724
because they don't
look like anyone else.

01:57:37.766 --> 01:57:39.642
You're an idiot.

01:57:39.684 --> 01:57:40.560
An idiot?

01:57:42.062 --> 01:57:43.146
An idiot?

01:57:44.898 --> 01:57:47.609
Not even a religious mastermind.

01:57:48.818 --> 01:57:49.986
Not even a mad man.

01:57:50.028 --> 01:57:52.697
Not even a psychopath,
just an idiot.

01:57:52.739 --> 01:57:55.241
Just an idiot (laughing).

01:57:55.283 --> 01:57:56.951
- To label you a mad
man would be an insult

01:57:56.993 --> 01:57:59.579
to insane people everywhere.

01:57:59.621 --> 01:58:03.208
You're too dumb to
be a mastermind.

01:58:03.249 --> 01:58:04.459
You murder people without
giving them the chance

01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:07.962
to defend themselves and
call yourself righteous?

01:58:08.004 --> 01:58:10.632
Or even more
ridiculous and worse.

01:58:13.635 --> 01:58:17.138
(gentle music continues)

01:58:21.685 --> 01:58:24.771
- Your wife murdered
my twin babies.

01:58:29.192 --> 01:58:31.903
And you see that
doctor right there.

01:58:31.945 --> 01:58:34.322
It happened in his clinic.

01:58:35.949 --> 01:58:38.368
They are the murders.

01:58:38.410 --> 01:58:41.287
You're the murderer, Donald.

01:58:41.329 --> 01:58:44.457
The very thing that you despise.

01:58:44.499 --> 01:58:46.626
But you know who's
not a murderer?

01:58:46.668 --> 01:58:47.502
Jaleece.

01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:50.005
She never had an abortion.

01:58:50.046 --> 01:58:51.965
She was innocent.

01:58:52.007 --> 01:58:53.925
Estella Estafan, innocent.

01:58:55.260 --> 01:58:59.389
Lonnie Lewis, Paislee
Parks, all innocent.

01:58:59.431 --> 01:59:00.932
And you murdered them anyways.

01:59:00.974 --> 01:59:03.309
They looked like murderers!

01:59:06.062 --> 01:59:08.356
They were gonna do it anyway.

01:59:08.398 --> 01:59:12.235
The exact same thing,
if I didn't stop them.

01:59:14.612 --> 01:59:18.658
They are who their
faces say they are.

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:23.496
(gentle music continues)
(crowd continues cheering)

01:59:24.873 --> 01:59:26.708
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:59:28.418 --> 01:59:32.339
let us now prepare for
the day of reckoning.

01:59:36.134 --> 01:59:38.636
This is how we rid this earth

01:59:40.555 --> 01:59:44.851
of these despicable people.
* Silent night

01:59:44.893 --> 01:59:47.270
* Holy night

01:59:48.563 --> 01:59:51.900
* All is calm
(Iceberg groaning)

01:59:51.941 --> 01:59:55.612
* All is is bright

01:59:55.653 --> 02:00:00.241

02:00:07.415 --> 02:00:10.794
let me see your hands
* And mild

02:00:10.835 --> 02:00:15.590
* Sleep in heavenly peace

02:00:18.927 --> 02:00:22.263
* Sleep in heavenly peace

02:00:23.348 --> 02:00:26.267
(crowd screaming)

02:00:27.811 --> 02:00:30.730
* Fall on your knees

02:00:32.023 --> 02:00:35.151
I got you, man, I got you.

02:00:35.193 --> 02:00:36.152
Where's my wife?

02:00:36.194 --> 02:00:37.153
I don't know, man.

02:00:37.195 --> 02:00:39.781
There was nobody
in here but you.

02:00:42.242 --> 02:00:47.288
* Fall on your knees

02:00:49.499 --> 02:00:54.671
* Fall on your knees

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:01.302
* Silent night

02:01:02.387 --> 02:01:05.765
* Holy night
(branches ruffling)

02:01:05.807 --> 02:01:09.561
* Son of God
(leaves rustling)

02:01:09.602 --> 02:01:13.440
* love's pure light

02:01:13.481 --> 02:01:18.486
* Radiant beams
from thy holy face

02:01:21.489 --> 02:01:25.577
* With the dawn of
redeeming grace

02:01:27.996 --> 02:01:33.084
* Jesus Lord, at Thy birth
(Donald laughing)

02:01:35.503 --> 02:01:38.673
- I had hope for a
way better ending.

02:01:40.008 --> 02:01:41.801
Something more artsy.

02:01:42.844 --> 02:01:44.179
Something that would
shake the world

02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:46.723
and live my name on in infamy.

02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:52.062
* Fall on your knees

02:01:53.188 --> 02:01:56.149
- Well I guess the
moon is full tonight.
