WEBVTT

00:05.353 --> 00:07.703
WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT--

00:07.746 --> 00:10.488
NURTURE OR NATURE?

00:10.532 --> 00:12.882
THAT'S BEEN
A HARD QUESTION

00:12.925 --> 00:15.624
FOR ME TO ANSWER,
PROFESSOR MOORE.

00:16.886 --> 00:21.064
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MY NATURE
INFLUENCES ME BECAUSE...

00:21.108 --> 00:23.675
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I COME FROM,

00:23.719 --> 00:26.156
AT LEAST NOT YET.

00:42.564 --> 00:44.218
SAID THE DNA TEST
COULD TAKE A WEEK.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.958
ONLY BEEN A FEW DAYS.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.525
- YOU GOT TO CHILL, MAN.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.137
THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.140
LOOK, I'M WITH YOU.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.664
I'M, UM...I'M FREE
THIS WEEKEND,

00:55.707 --> 00:58.319
THOUGH, IF YOU WANT
TO, YOU KNOW,
CHOP IT UP.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.321
NAW, I CAN'T DO THAT.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.279
GOT STUFF TO DO.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.629
I MEAN,
AM I A BEAST ON THE MOUND

01:04.673 --> 01:09.721
BECAUSE I INHERITED MY SKILLS
OR BECAUSE I WORKED MY ASS OFF
LIKE THE BEST ATHLETES?

01:20.471 --> 01:23.779
THE TOURNAMENT THIS WEEKEND
IS DO-OR-DIE, LADIES.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.389
WE ARE GOING TO BE
PLAYING AGAINST SOME

01:25.433 --> 01:28.000
OF THE BEST PLAYERS
IN OUR CONFERENCE.

01:28.044 --> 01:31.700
NOW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN
IMPRESS COACH LONI

01:31.743 --> 01:34.268
AND LAND AT LEAST
FIFTH PLACE,

01:34.311 --> 01:36.400
YOU'LL BE MOVING UP
THE TEAM RANKINGS.

01:36.444 --> 01:40.187
YOUR OPPONENTS ARE LISTED
OUTSIDE OF COACH LONI'S DOOR.

THAT DOESN'T
SOUND GOOD.
WHO'D YOU GET?

02:03.645 --> 02:05.603
OH, I'M NOT
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.432
YOU'RE PLAYING HELENA ADAMS.
SHE IS THE NUMBER-2 PLAYER

02:08.476 --> 02:10.434
IN OUR CONFERENCE,
LITERALLY THE ONLY PLAYER

02:10.478 --> 02:12.436
WHO MADE ME SWEAT
LAST SEASON.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.612
GET READY.

02:14.656 --> 02:16.614
NATURE OR NURTURE?

02:16.658 --> 02:19.139
I WISH I KNEW WHICH ONE WAS
MORE IMPORTANT 'CAUSE WHEN LIFE

02:19.182 --> 02:22.272
THROWS STUFF AT US, WHEN WE FACE
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES,

02:22.316 --> 02:26.450
IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW
WHICH PART OF OUR IDENTITY
TO DRAW FROM.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.504
AND I THOUGHT THEA
AND I WERE TRADING IN

02:36.547 --> 02:38.854
OUR FRENEMIES BAG FOR
A FULL-TIME FRIEND ONE,

02:38.897 --> 02:41.378
BUT SHE LITERALLY TRIED
TO PSYCH ME OUT TODAY.

02:41.422 --> 02:44.120
KEY WORD IS "TRIED."
A BAD BITCH CANNOT

02:44.164 --> 02:46.209
GET PSYCHED OUT,
AND YOU, MY FRIEND,

02:46.253 --> 02:48.298
ARE A TEXTBOOK
BAD BITCH.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.432
- I RECEIVE THAT. THANK YOU.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.913
KEISH?

02:54.957 --> 02:56.480
YOU HERE
WITH US, GIRL?

02:56.524 --> 02:58.003
YEAH, I'M JUST NOT
HUNGRY, I GUESS.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.832
THIS CHINESE FOOD IS NOT IT.
MMM, OK.

03:00.876 --> 03:02.660
YOU WANT TO TRY AGAIN?

03:02.704 --> 03:06.316
YOU REALLY WANT US
TO BELIEVE THIS MOOD HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH CAM?

03:06.360 --> 03:08.449
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM
SINCE YOU STOOD HIM UP?

03:08.492 --> 03:11.147
NO, BUT THIS MOOD'S
NOT ABOUT HIM.

03:11.191 --> 03:15.195
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY...
ABOUT HIM.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.592
- THIS IS YOUR MOM?
- YEAH, HER BIRTHDAY'S
ON SUNDAY.

03:21.636 --> 03:25.596
IN FILIPINO CULTURE,
BIRTHDAYS OF SOMEONE WHO'S
PASSED AWAY ARE A BIG DEAL.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.686
WE GO TO THEIR GRAVE
AND WE CELEBRATE THEM.

03:28.730 --> 03:31.341
'CAUSE OF WORK, THIS IS
THE FIRST YEAR ME AND MY DAD

03:31.385 --> 03:34.431
CAN'T FLY BACK TO DETROIT
FOR HER BIRTHDAY.

03:34.475 --> 03:38.914
DOES NOT HELP THAT HE
AND I AREN'T SPEAKING
RIGHT NOW, EITHER.

03:42.091 --> 03:44.354
KEISH,
I'M REALLY SORRY,

03:44.398 --> 03:46.356
BUT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.619
YOU GOT US.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.710
- THANK YOU...
- MM-HMM.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.844
BUT I THINK I REALLY
NEED TO FLY SOLO
THIS WEEKEND, SO--

03:55.887 --> 03:59.369
OH, IF YOU THINK
WE'RE GONNA LET YOU
SULK ALONE,

03:59.413 --> 04:01.371
THEN YOU MUST
HAVE US CONFUSED

04:01.415 --> 04:03.852
WITH YOUR LESS CUTE
BEST FRIENDS.

04:03.895 --> 04:06.550
OK, FINE,

04:06.594 --> 04:09.074
BUT, NO, I--I REALLY
DO HAVE TO GO.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.512
I PROMISED DR. P.
THAT I'D HELP HER SET UP
FOR THE SUMMIT, SO...

04:11.555 --> 04:13.731
-OH.
-LOVE Y'ALL.

04:13.775 --> 04:16.952
-LOVE YOU.
-LOVE YOU, TOO.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.743
SO TWO DAYS IS
ENOUGH TIME TO RESEARCH

04:25.787 --> 04:28.920
AND PLAN A TRADITIONAL
FILIPINO BIRTHDAY
CELEBRATION, RIGHT?

04:28.964 --> 04:32.272
I'VE DONE MEDIUM-
SIZED BOX BRAIDS
IN UNDER 3 HOURS.

04:32.315 --> 04:34.578
THERE ARE FEW THINGS
I CANNOT ACCOMPLISH.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.276
- OK.
- HEH HEH HEH!

04:36.319 --> 04:38.756
PERIOD.
HA HA HA!

04:38.800 --> 04:42.325
OK.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.894
IT LOOKS GOOD.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.809
THANKS SO MUCH FOR
YOUR HELP, KEISHA.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.159
YEAH, OF COURSE.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.508
OH, WOW.
LOOK AT THIS.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.510
HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
COACH MARCUS?

04:53.554 --> 04:54.990
HEY, HEY. ACTUALLY,
I WANT TO SEE

04:55.033 --> 04:56.948
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP YOU.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.734
THAT'S VERY SWEET,
BUT I THINK WE
GOT IT COVERED.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.607
TSK.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.131
I'MMA GO ANYWHERE
BUT HERE.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.308
-UH--
-BYE.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.135
SINCE THE BLACKOUT,
LOOK,

05:10.179 --> 05:13.617
I KNOW THINGS BETWEEN US
HAVE BEEN--HEH!--WEIRD.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.967
CALLING IT WEIRD IS
A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.187
LOOK, WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO CALL IT,
THERE'S DISTANCE

05:18.230 --> 05:21.451
BETWEEN US NOW, AND I DON'T
LIKE IT, AND WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE FRIENDS, AMARA.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.367
YOU AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING AS SIMPLE
AS FRIENDS, MARCUS.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.369
IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T TRY.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.328
LOOK, WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE THIS'LL LEAD US

05:28.371 --> 05:32.201
TO, YOU KNOW--
I REALLY NEED
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

05:32.244 --> 05:35.117
OK.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.426
YOU OK?

05:39.469 --> 05:41.297
FEELS LIKE SOMEONE IS
DOING THE CUPID SHUFFLE

05:41.341 --> 05:43.821
ON MY STOMACH.
I BET YOU IT'S
THAT CHINESE FOOD.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.476
I TOLD YOU
THAT 4-STAR RATING
WASN'T LEGIT NOW.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A 4.3, THANK YOU.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.654
- OH, 4.3, OH.
- THANK YOU. HEH!

05:50.698 --> 05:53.657
YOU CAN STOP
DRAGGING ME NOW.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.660
WHAT EXACTLY IS
YOUR ASSIGNMENT, ANYWAY?

05:56.704 --> 05:58.140
I GOT TO DO
THIS PROJECT

05:58.183 --> 05:59.750
ON THE NATURE
VS. NURTURE THEORY,

05:59.794 --> 06:01.404
LIKE WHAT SHAPES US

06:01.448 --> 06:02.884
INTO WHO WE'RE
GONNA BECOME.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.103
IS IT THE FAMILY
THAT WE'RE BORN INTO

06:05.147 --> 06:07.018
OR OUR ENVIRONMENT?

06:07.062 --> 06:10.413
MY MOM KNOWS AS MUCH
ABOUT MY ADOPTION
AS I DO.

06:10.457 --> 06:13.198
MY DAD, UM...

06:13.242 --> 06:16.376
YEAH, MY DAD, HE HAS
ALZHEIMER'S, SO,

06:16.419 --> 06:19.204
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T REALLY GET
ANSWERS FROM HIM.

06:19.248 --> 06:22.643
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
ABOUT YOUR DAD.
- YEAH.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.645
WELL, LOOK...

06:24.688 --> 06:27.169
THE ASSIGNMENT IS
PROVING WHICH PART

06:27.212 --> 06:30.172
OF THE THEORY YOU FIND
MORE IMPACTFUL, RIGHT?

06:30.215 --> 06:32.870
YOUR PROFESSOR DIDN'T SAY
YOU HAD TO USE YOUR OWN
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES,

06:32.914 --> 06:35.133
SO MAYBE YOU COULD
INTERVIEW PEOPLE.

06:35.177 --> 06:38.049
LIKE A MINI...
DOCUMENTARY-TYPE THING?

06:38.093 --> 06:40.574
- YES.
- THAT'S ACTUALLY KINDA DOPE.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.924
I KNOW.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.535
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.

06:46.710 --> 06:49.409
OK. I GOT TO GO
MEET THE TEAM,

06:49.452 --> 06:52.063
BUT AFTER MY TENNIS
TOURNAMENT TOMORROW,

06:52.107 --> 06:53.891
YOU CAN INTERVIEW ME.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.546
ALL RIGHT.
BET. HEH!

06:56.590 --> 06:58.461
APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP AGAIN.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.681

07:00.724 --> 07:03.901
YOU KNOW WHO REALLY
COULD HELP YOU?

07:03.945 --> 07:05.816
J.R.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.689
YEAH.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.952
- DAMON, LISTEN.
- LISTEN, I'VE AL--

07:10.995 --> 07:12.693
DAMON, LISTEN.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.695
YEAH, UM, THAT GUY

07:14.738 --> 07:16.740
WANTS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

07:16.784 --> 07:19.482
DNA TEST JUST PROBABLY
GOT HIM SHOOK,

07:19.526 --> 07:23.181
AND IF YOU ARE
BROTHERS, I MEAN...

07:23.225 --> 07:25.488
IT'LL CHANGE EVERYTHING.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.143
Y'ALL TALKED ABOUT
WHAT THAT COULD MEAN?

07:32.234 --> 07:34.845
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.943
♪ KNOCK IT OUT

07:45.987 --> 07:48.032
♪ KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK,
KNOCK, KNOCK IT OUT ♪

07:48.076 --> 07:50.470

WES, UNLESS
YOU WANT FLIES

07:52.210 --> 07:53.864
DON'T UNCOVER
THE POTATO SALAD YET.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.866
MY BAD. DUDE,
WE'RE SETTING UP

07:55.910 --> 07:57.564
FOR FOUNDERS' DAY WEEKEND,
NOT HIGH TEA.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.479
HEY, Q., WHEN
THE LAST TIME YOU

07:59.522 --> 08:03.047
CHECKED THE BRISKET?
J.R., RELAX.
THIS IS MAD CASUAL.

08:03.091 --> 08:06.050
UH, NO. WE HAVE
OUR O.G. BROTHERS
ROLLING THROUGH.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.792
WE NEED TO SHOW 'EM
THAT WE NOT JUST ABOUT
PARTIES AND STEP SHOWS.

08:08.836 --> 08:12.317
IF IT ISN'T MY FAVORITE
K.E.K. LITTLE BROTHER.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.494
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
-WELL, YOU KNOW,

08:14.537 --> 08:17.018
I'M STILL
AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF
THE BETA CHAPTER.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.020
- NO, I KNOW...
- WHOO!

08:19.063 --> 08:21.022
BUT WE JUST ASSUMED,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

08:21.065 --> 08:23.415
YOU'D SIT THIS YEAR
FOUNDERS' BARBECUE OUT.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.330
NOW, WHY WOULD I
DO THAT?

08:25.374 --> 08:28.072
THIS WHOLE WEEKEND IS ABOUT
K.E.K. BROTHERHOOD,

08:28.116 --> 08:31.641
SO LET'S LEAVE THE ANIMOSITY
OUT ON THE DIAMOND.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.948
SPEAKING OF,
HOW MY TEAM DOING?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.645
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I QUIT.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.082
NOW, MARCUS WAS ALWAYS
A BLOCKHEAD, BUT HIM

08:38.126 --> 08:40.781
LETTING YOU QUIT,
WELL, THAT'S SHOCKING.

08:40.824 --> 08:43.523
YOU WANT TO TALK IT OUT?

08:43.566 --> 08:46.177
NAW. I'M GOOD.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.921
♪ OH!

08:50.965 --> 08:53.576
HEY.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.404
OUR DISCUSSION
AT THE BEGINNING

08:55.447 --> 08:57.841
OF THE SEMESTER WAS
"KEEP A LOW PROFILE."

08:57.885 --> 09:00.409
GIVEN EVERYTHING,
THE PRUDENT THING WOULD
HAVE BEEN TO CANCEL THIS.

09:00.452 --> 09:04.413
LOOK, YOU CAN CUT MY CLASSES,
WHOEVER CAN TAG MY DOOR

09:04.456 --> 09:06.937
OR SLANDER MY NAME ONLINE,
BUT Y'ALL CAN'T PREVENT ME

09:06.981 --> 09:09.200
FROM ENGAGING OUR STUDENTS
IN CRUCIAL DISCOURSE.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.508
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE.
YOU'RE ON SCHOOL PROPERTY.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.815
YOUR PERMISSION TO
HOLD THIS EVENT HERE

09:14.858 --> 09:17.513
IN THE HALL OF
THE HBCU ALUMNI
IS REVOKED.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.994
ZEKE,
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.996
THE SUMMIT IS
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.693
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO FIND A NEW VENUE

09:23.737 --> 09:25.565
ON SHORT NOTICE.
THAT'S THE POINT.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.915
YOU HAVE
TO LAY LOW.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.917
ZEKE.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.833
UM, PLEASE TELL ME
I DID NOT JUST HEAR
MY DAD CORRECTLY.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.400
YOU CAN'T CANCEL
THE SUMMIT, DR. P.

09:35.444 --> 09:38.099
-I KNOW.
-HEY. YOU GUYS OK?

09:38.142 --> 09:41.406
MY ASS OF A FATHER
JUST PULLED THE VENUE
FOR THE SUMMIT.

09:41.450 --> 09:44.801
IF I NEED
TO HOST THE EVENT
ON MY ROOF, I WILL.

09:44.845 --> 09:47.325
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:47.369 --> 09:50.764
I MAYBE HAVE
A PLACE FOR YOU TO HOLD
YOUR EVENT TOMORROW.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.640
-MMM. HEH!
-AND I KNEW

09:57.684 --> 10:00.121
THAT COACH LONI IS SO FOR
BLACK FEMALE EMPOWERMENT,

10:00.164 --> 10:02.645
SO I KNEW SHE'D
BE DOWN TO LET YOU USE
THE TENNIS COURTS.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.822
SHE'S HAPPY TO TAKE ON ALLEN.
PLEASE TELL HER
I SAID THANK YOU.

10:05.866 --> 10:09.391
AND WAS DAMON AND FRIENDS
YOUR DOING, TOO?

10:09.434 --> 10:11.045
UH, NO.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.351
I THINK THAT WAS
COACH MARCUS.

10:13.395 --> 10:17.007
MM-HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME JUST--LET ME GO

ANY OTHER OPTION.
-HMM.

HOW MUCH WE DON'T HAVE,
THERE WERE GENERATIONS

THAT THIS GENERATION

14:24.689 --> 14:27.344
GOES FURTHER THAN MINE DID.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.391
THAT WHY YOU BROKE
THE RULES WITH THOSE
PAPER CLASSES?

14:30.434 --> 14:32.567

14:32.610 --> 14:35.570

14:35.613 --> 14:38.355

AND KEEP US BEHIND.

AND RULES FOR THEM,

WE ARE JUDGED BY
A HIGHER STANDARD.

14:42.838 --> 14:46.015

REMAIN ABOVE REPROACH.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.713

BY OTHER THINGS.

BUT FOR YOU,

COME MONEY,

14:57.766 --> 14:59.899
AND WITH MONEY
COMES POWER

14:59.942 --> 15:01.378

15:01.422 --> 15:04.381
THAT MANY FOLKS DON'T
WANT YOU TO HAVE.

15:04.425 --> 15:07.732
I KNOW THAT YOU MAY
NEVER BELIEVE

15:07.776 --> 15:10.213
THAT EVERYTHING I DID

15:10.257 --> 15:13.521
WAS SO THAT
YOU BOYS COULD HAVE
THE ATHLETIC SUCCESS

15:13.564 --> 15:16.480

ACHIEVE, BUT IT'S TRUE.

OUR LEGACY IS CONCERNED...

15:22.530 --> 15:25.359

PRINT UP THAT ARTICLE.

ALL THE WAYS THEY
TRY TO SILENCE US,

15:28.101 --> 15:32.061
OR WORSE, PUNISH US
FOR SPEAKING TRUTH.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.150

AND PROFESSIONALLY.

REMISS IF I DID NOT
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS

15:50.993 --> 15:53.256

I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
BEEN GIVEN

15:53.300 --> 15:56.129
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
OR RESPECT.
MMM.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.479
BUT JUST BECAUSE I
HAVE TOUGH MOMENTS

15:58.522 --> 16:01.003
DOES NOT MEAN
IT'S ALWAYS GOING
TO BE THIS WAY.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.701

AND EXPERIENCE,
OR GENETICS?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.940

16:39.868 --> 16:42.044

16:43.263 --> 16:46.048

16:46.092 --> 16:50.966
OFF THE COURTS,
I GUESS I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT WHO I AM.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.447
UH--HEH!

16:53.490 --> 16:56.145
MAYBE PART OF ME IS
AFRAID TO DISCOVER
WHO I AM

16:56.189 --> 16:59.148
WITHOUT A RACKET
IN MY HAND.

16:59.192 --> 17:03.239
OH, YOU--YOU CAN, LIKE,
ERASE THAT PART, RIGHT?

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
NO, NOT A CHANCE.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.069

17:39.623 --> 17:43.062
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

17:43.105 --> 17:47.501
WHAT DO YOU THINK
INFLUENCES YOU MORE--
NATURE OR NURTURE?

17:47.544 --> 17:50.243

18:00.209 --> 18:03.995
I LOST MY MATCH
TODAY,

18:04.039 --> 18:07.912
AND EVEN WORSE,
I SHOWED MY ASS
ON THE COURT,

18:07.956 --> 18:10.393
SO I...

18:10.437 --> 18:13.918
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HAPPENED, AND...

18:13.962 --> 18:18.097
I, UH, I DON'T
EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT
VERSION OF MYSELF,

18:18.140 --> 18:20.708

SHOWED ME SOMETHING

18:35.462 --> 18:37.028
A LITTLE EARLIER.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.248
WELL, BEING HONEST,
YOU SHOWED ME
SOMETHING, TOO.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.989
HEH! YOU DON'T SEEM
LIKE THE SAME YOUNG MAN

18:41.032 --> 18:42.469
I USED TO COACH.
YEAH.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.949
IN A LOT OF WAYS,
I GUESS I'M NOT.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.734

AFTER ALL, HMM?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.660
HMM.

MY PARENTS

19:04.665 --> 19:06.623
ARE DIVORCING,
I SPIRALED,

19:06.667 --> 19:09.148
STARTED GETTING
DRUNK, HIGH,

19:09.191 --> 19:12.803
QUIT THE TEAM, AND NOW
I'M BEEFING WITH
MY CLOSEST FRIENDS.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.980
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
BASEBALL WAS
MY DAD'S THING.

19:16.024 --> 19:20.550
AT SOME POINT, BASEBALL
BECAME SOMETHING I
WAS DOING FOR ME.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.335
I MISS IT,

19:22.378 --> 19:24.598
AND I NEED IT.

19:25.816 --> 19:29.168
SON,
FORGET ABOUT BASEBALL.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.955
LOOK, THERE WAS
A REASON WHY I HAD YOU
RIDING THE BENCH.

19:33.998 --> 19:37.045
YOU WAS A DECENT
CATCHER, BUT YOU WASN'T
NEVER GONNA GO PRO.

19:37.088 --> 19:38.612
FOCUS ON THE THINGS

19:38.655 --> 19:41.005
THAT WILL SUSTAIN YOU:

19:41.049 --> 19:43.182
SCHOOL, K.E.K.

19:43.225 --> 19:47.011
NOW, THIS IS
THE BROTHERHOOD
THAT NEEDS YOU NOW.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.013
THIS.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.538
THIS IS YOU.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.898
RUNNING A MILE
A MINUTE ISN'T GONNA

20:03.941 --> 20:06.248
HELP YOU FIGURE OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.989
I USED TO GET

20:08.032 --> 20:11.210
REALLY BAD HEADACHES
BEFORE MATCHES BECAUSE

20:11.253 --> 20:14.561
I LET MY ANXIETY GET
THE BEST OF ME.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.085
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU TODAY.

20:17.128 --> 20:20.784
WRONG. I WAS READY
FOR THAT MATCH.

20:20.828 --> 20:23.483
I HAD EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL, AND
THEN I STEPPED FOOT

20:23.526 --> 20:25.528
ON THE COURT AND IT
JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

20:25.572 --> 20:29.184
I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE THAT SINCE--
THE PANIC ATTACK
THE FIRST WEEK?

20:29.228 --> 20:32.361
YEAH, I OVERHEARD YOU
AND KEISHA TALKING
ABOUT IT ONE DAY.

20:32.405 --> 20:34.798
I ENCOURAGE YOU
TO DISCOVER YOUR
INSIDE VOICE.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.236
LOOK...
THANKS FOR THE TIP.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.760
SIMONE, IF YOU HAD
A PANIC ATTACK

20:39.803 --> 20:42.284
ONCE, WHAT MADE YOU
THINK YOU COULDN'T
HAVE ONE AGAIN?

20:42.328 --> 20:45.244
BECAUSE I'M NOT LIKE SOME
OF THESE GIRLS WHO CAN'T
HANDLE PRESSURE, THEA.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.071
HELENA'S STRENGTH
IS HER ABILITY

20:47.115 --> 20:49.944
TO PULL THE ANXIETY
OUT OF HER OPPONENTS,

20:49.987 --> 20:52.251
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME
THAT YOU WALK OUT
ONTO THAT COURT,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.427
YOU HAVE TO BE
MENTALLY PREPARED
FOR ANYTHING,

20:54.470 --> 20:56.429
AND YOU AND I HAVE
HAD SOME VERSION OF
THIS SAME CONVERSATION

20:56.472 --> 20:58.996
SINCE YOU VISITED
BRINGSTON LAST
HOMECOMING WEEKEND,

20:59.040 --> 21:01.303
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
FINALLY HEAR ME?!

21:01.347 --> 21:04.350
HAVING ANXIETY
DOESN'T MAKE YOU
WEAK, SIMONE.

21:04.393 --> 21:08.919
THE WEAKNESS COMES
FROM REFUSING TO WORK
WITH THE ANXIETY.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.705
- SO WHAT DO I DO?
- YOU TELL ME.

21:11.748 --> 21:15.926
I MEDITATE
BEFORE MATCHES TO
CONTROL MY NERVES.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.929
WHEN BECCA CHANTS
THE ABCs AS LOUD
AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE,

21:18.973 --> 21:21.454
THAT'S HER WAY OF
GETTING INTO THE ZONE.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.978
YEAH, WE ALL HAVE
OUR THING.

21:24.021 --> 21:28.199
YOU JUST HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT GETS
YOU INTO YOUR ZONE.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.766
LOOK,

21:29.810 --> 21:32.291
THE CONSOLATION MATCHES
ARE TOMORROW.

21:32.334 --> 21:36.382
IF YOU PLACE FIFTH,
YOU'LL STILL BE ABLE
TO MOVE UP THE RANKING.

21:36.425 --> 21:39.341
DON'T WASTE THE SHOT.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.303
AH. HA HA.
LOOK AT YOU, MAN.

21:44.346 --> 21:47.784
NO JUDGMENT,
BUT, UH, AIN'T DOCTORS
SUPPOSED TO EAT BETTER?

21:47.828 --> 21:50.613
HEH! TYPICALLY, YES.
IT'S AURORA'S BIRTHDAY.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.137
I'M SO SORRY.

21:53.181 --> 21:56.445
EVERY YEAR, ON HER BIRTHDAY,
I EAT SOME OF HER
FAVORITE FOODS.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.795
AURORA WAS
AN INCREDIBLE WOMAN.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.406
WELL,

22:00.449 --> 22:01.798
AIN'T THIS A TREAT?

22:01.842 --> 22:03.887
COACH SHAW,
TO WHAT DO WE OWE

22:03.931 --> 22:06.063
THE UNEXPECTED
AND UNWELCOME VISIT?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.762
OH, WELL,
I'M JUST CHECKIN' IN
ON SOME FRAT BROTHERS

22:08.805 --> 22:10.981
AND SOME OLD FRIENDS
LIKE YOU.

22:11.025 --> 22:13.506
- ENJOY YOUR DAY, COACH SHAW.
- I KNOW THE STRESSES

22:13.549 --> 22:15.508
OF FIRST-YEAR
HEAD-COACHIN'.

22:15.551 --> 22:19.381
WELL, IT'S A LOT, I MEAN,
EVEN FOR THE BEST OF 'EM.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.165
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE OK

22:21.209 --> 22:24.386
'CAUSE IF ONE
OF MY PLAYERS HAD UP
AND QUIT ON ME--HEH!--

22:24.430 --> 22:27.346
I'D PROBABLY FEEL
SOME KINDA WAY ABOUT THAT.

22:27.389 --> 22:30.349
TEAM LOOKIN' A LITTLE
THIN THERE, MARCUS.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.176
YOU KEEP THIS UP,

22:32.220 --> 22:36.137
YOU GONNA BE PICKIN' UP
PLAYERS OFF THE STREET.

22:39.053 --> 22:42.491
LOOK, ZEKE, I GOT
EVERYTHING HANDLED,
OK? TRUST ME.

22:42.535 --> 22:47.366
I HOPE SO BECAUSE
YOUR FUNDING, AND THUS
YOUR PROGRAM, IS AT STAKE.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.894
SO I BEGGED MY COACH
TO PUT ME IN ON SPECIAL TEAMS.

22:53.937 --> 22:56.113
AND WHEN I SCORED
THAT 85-YARD
TOUCHDOWN RETURN,

22:56.157 --> 22:58.855
I KNEW COULDN'T
NOBODY MAKE ME FEEL
BAD ABOUT MYSELF.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.857
AND THAT IS--THAT'S
GREAT, MAN, BUT,

23:00.901 --> 23:03.033
I MEAN, YOU STILL
HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

23:03.077 --> 23:06.515
WELL, YOU ASKED ME WHAT'S
BEEN MORE INFLUENTIAL,
RIGHT--NATURE OR NURTURE?

23:06.559 --> 23:10.606
- YES.
- WELL, MY IDENTITY IS TIED TO
HOW HARD I WORKED AT FOOTBALL.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.478
- LOOK,

23:12.521 --> 23:14.436
JUST FOLLOW ME FOR
A SECOND, ALL RIGHT?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.960
I COME FROM
A FAMILY OF SINGERS,
BUT I DON'T SEE MYSELF

23:17.004 --> 23:19.093
AS A SINGER 'CAUSE I
DON'T HAVE TO WORK FOR IT.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.574
I'M THE FIRST PERSON
IN MY FAMILY TO GET OUT
OF SOUTH L.A.

23:21.617 --> 23:25.447
AND GO TO COLLEGE 'CAUSE
I WORKED TO BE THE BEST
WIDE RECEIVER I COULD BE.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.407
FOOTBALL WAS MY WAY OUT.

23:29.712 --> 23:32.933
THE ONLY THING THAT I
WORKED FOR IS GONE.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.240
GUESS I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO I AM NO MORE.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.895
UH, BREAK THAT DOWN
FOR ME. SO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.724
LIKE, HOW CAN YOU
NOT KNOW WHO YOU
ARE, BRO? HEH!

23:41.768 --> 23:43.726
KNOWING YOUR FAMILY TREE
AIN'T EVERYTHING.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.468
I MEAN, IT'S A PART
OF YOU, BUT IT DON'T
COMPLETE YOU,

23:46.512 --> 23:50.080
SO I STILL GOT
TO FIGURE IT OUT, ATTACH
MYSELF TO SOMETHING NEW.

23:50.124 --> 23:52.387
ANYWAYS, I GUESS I'M
TEAM NURTURE OVER NATURE.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.912
REAL TALK,
IN YOUR CASE, I--I
THINK YOU NEED BOTH.

23:55.956 --> 23:57.827
THE NATURE,
IT'S THE GIFT,

23:57.871 --> 23:59.960
AND THE NURTURE, THAT'S
WHAT YOU DO WITH IT.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.137
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE SINGING SERIOUSLY.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.661
I MEAN,
WHAT IF YOU POURED
INTO, YOU KNOW,

24:05.705 --> 24:07.620
SINGING HOW YOU
DO FOOTBALL?

24:07.663 --> 24:10.710
THAT THING THAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR,
THAT MISSING PIECE--

24:10.753 --> 24:14.714
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
THIS WHOLE TIME.

24:14.757 --> 24:18.457

27:49.232 --> 27:51.757

27:51.800 --> 27:54.716
YOU'RE A BADASS

27:54.760 --> 27:56.805
THAT WAS THEA MAYS

28:01.288 --> 28:03.899
ANOTHER MATCH TO WIN.
ARE YOU READY?

28:03.943 --> 28:06.989
HELL YEAH.
I GOT THIS.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.993
HI. I'M KEISHA,

28:11.037 --> 28:14.649
AND I GUESS I'M A PART
OF THE NATURE CAMP.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.305
I SEE MYSELF
AS A STRONG BLACK
AND FILIPINA WOMAN,

28:18.348 --> 28:22.309
AND ALTHOUGH
I'M PROUD TO BE FROM A
TWO-CULTURE HOUSEHOLD,

28:22.352 --> 28:25.704
THERE ARE STILL PARTS
I DON'T KNOW

28:25.747 --> 28:27.836
ABOUT BOTH SIDES
OF MY FAMILY.

28:27.880 --> 28:30.012
WHEN MY MOM MOVED
TO THE STATES AND
MARRIED MY DAD,

28:30.056 --> 28:33.363
A LOT OF HER FAMILY CUT
HER OFF, AND MY DAD WAS

28:33.407 --> 28:35.670
A MILITARY BRAT, SO HE
MOVED AROUND SO MUCH
THAT HIS PARENTS

28:35.714 --> 28:39.805
NEVER REALLY PLANTED
ROOTS DEEP ENOUGH
TO TRULY GROW, SO...

28:41.415 --> 28:45.027
BUT IN THE ABSENCE
OF THOSE PARTS OF
MY IDENTITY,

28:45.071 --> 28:48.378
I CLING TO THE PARTS
THAT I DO KNOW.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.859
MY LOVE FOR DANCE...

28:50.903 --> 28:53.209
COMES FROM MY MOM
AND...

28:53.253 --> 28:55.037
HER CULTURE,

28:55.081 --> 28:59.041
AND MY NEED TO SERVE

28:59.085 --> 29:03.306
AND TAKE CARE
OF PEOPLE COMES
FROM MY DAD.

29:04.525 --> 29:08.181
AND I THINK THAT'S
MORE THAN ENOUGH
FROM ME. HEH!

29:08.224 --> 29:10.183
UH...
YEAH.

29:10.226 --> 29:12.402
ALL THOSE
LITTLE THINGS,

29:12.446 --> 29:15.928
THOSE LITTLE PARTS OF
MY IDENTITY, MAKE UP
WHO I AM TODAY, SO...

29:15.971 --> 29:17.668
YEAH,
THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:17.712 --> 29:20.323
YOU KNOW, WE
ALWAYS FOCUS ON...

29:20.367 --> 29:24.545
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON WHAT WE DO.

29:24.588 --> 29:26.721
UH, THANKS.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.941
YEAH, YEAH.

29:30.159 --> 29:32.466
YO, LOOK,

29:32.509 --> 29:35.469
I KNOW NOT KNOWING
YOUR BIOLOGICAL FAMILY
MEANS THAT THERE ARE

29:35.512 --> 29:39.255
PARTS OF YOU
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE,
AND THAT SUCKS,

29:39.299 --> 29:41.301
BUT FOCUS ON THE PARTS
THAT YOU DO KNOW.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.085
YOU'RE AN
INCREDIBLE ATHLETE,

29:43.129 --> 29:45.087
AND YOU'RE KIND

29:45.131 --> 29:47.655
AND FUNNY,
SOMETIMES...

29:47.698 --> 29:50.136
AND LOYAL.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.529
YOU HAVE TWO
ADOPTIVE PARENTS
WHO ADORE YOU.

29:52.573 --> 29:55.228
DOUBLE DOWN
ON THOSE PARTS
OF YOUR IDENTITY.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.491
HEH! YEAH.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.493
A'IGHT, A'IGHT.
A'IGHT,

29:59.536 --> 30:02.539
A'IGHT, A'IGHT. A'IGHT.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.803
WHAT?

30:04.846 --> 30:08.458
BRO, WE MEAN THIS
IN THE NICEST WAY
POSSIBLE, BUT--

30:08.502 --> 30:10.286
YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR ASS
BACK TO BASEBALL.

30:10.330 --> 30:12.114
I TOLD Y'ALL I
WAS DONE WITH THAT.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.290
THAT'S CAP, J.R.
YOU NEED BASEBALL.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.466
EVERYONE CAN SEE HOW MISERABLE
YOU ARE WITHOUT IT.

30:16.510 --> 30:18.642
I OVERHEARD YOU TALKING
WITH SHAW, HOW HE TRIED

30:18.686 --> 30:20.644
TO TALK YOU OUTTA
GETTING BACK ON THE TEAM.

30:20.688 --> 30:23.256
BUMP THAT DUDE.
LISTEN TO YOUR HEART.

30:23.299 --> 30:25.780
YO...

30:25.824 --> 30:27.869
I'M NOT GONNA SAY
I DON'T MISS IT,

30:27.913 --> 30:30.480
BUT I JUST CAN'T GO
TO COACH TO TELL HIM
I WANT BACK IN.

30:30.524 --> 30:33.875
MAYBE NOT,
BUT YOU WON'T KNOW
UNLESS YOU TRY.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.444
QUESTION IS, DO YOU
STILL LOVE THE GAME
ENOUGH TO FIGHT FOR IT?

30:43.798 --> 30:46.453
OH. OOH. HEH!

30:46.496 --> 30:48.672
OK, I KNOW
I WAS A LITTLE HARSH
ON YOU EARLIER,

30:48.716 --> 30:51.980
BUT IS THIS ENTIRELY NECESSARY?
YES, IT IS.
NOW, HUSH.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.982
-OH.
-OK.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.289
OPEN YOUR EYES.

BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR MY MOM.

31:14.785 --> 31:18.180
TSK. SINCE YOU
COULDN'T CELEBRATE
AT YOUR MOM'S GRAVE,

31:18.224 --> 31:21.270
WE BROUGHT
THE CELEBRATION TO YOU.

31:25.057 --> 31:28.016
WE WANTED TO MAKE THIS

31:28.060 --> 31:32.151
AS AUTHENTIC
AND HONEST AS POSSIBLE.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.414
WE HOPE IT'S OK
THAT WE DID THIS.

31:34.457 --> 31:37.417
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

31:37.460 --> 31:41.638
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I DID TO DESERVE Y'ALL.

31:42.857 --> 31:46.861
THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU.
WE LOVE YOU, TOO.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.603
EXCUSE ME.

DOOR CLOSES]

32:09.188 --> 32:11.451
KEISHA.

32:12.669 --> 32:15.107
I KNOW I'M NOT
YOUR FAVORITE PERSON
RIGHT NOW,

32:15.150 --> 32:18.197
BUT WE SHOULD BE
TOGETHER TODAY.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.431
CHEERS.

32:35.475 --> 32:37.129
-CHEERS.
-CHEERS.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.000
OH, CHEERS.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.221
AH, YOU WERE
SUCH A FIRECRACKER,
JUST LIKE YOUR MOM.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.963
THERE WOULD BE TIMES
WHEN THE TWO OF YOU

32:45.006 --> 32:47.878
WOULD SHARE A LOOK
AND JUST LAUGH

32:47.922 --> 32:50.359
TELEPATHICALLY,
IN SYNC.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.579
THAT'S WHAT I MISS
MOST--

32:52.622 --> 32:54.973
SEEING YOU WITH HER.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.844
I'M SORRY

32:56.887 --> 32:59.542
FOR THE WAY I ACTED
AND DISTANCE
BETWEEN US.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.544
YOU LETTING GO
OF MEDICINE WAS LIKE

33:01.588 --> 33:04.939
LOSING THE LAST PIECE
OF YOUR MOM.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.464
SHE WAS SO EXCITED
THAT YOU WANTED
TO GO INTO MEDICINE.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.467
IT'S ONE OF
THE LAST THINGS
WE TALKED ABOUT.

33:11.511 --> 33:15.036
I THOUGHT, IF WE
STAYED ON THE PATH
THE WAY WE PLANNED,

33:15.080 --> 33:17.299
THE PAIN WOULD STOP,

33:17.343 --> 33:19.823
BUT IT HASN'T,

33:19.867 --> 33:23.653
AND I LET THAT PAIN
OVERSHADOW BEING A
BETTER FATHER TO YOU.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.656
FOR THAT,
I'M SORRY, TOO.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.658
IT MAY TAKE ME
A MINUTE TO GET

33:28.702 --> 33:31.835
FULLY ONBOARD WITH
THIS DANCE THING,

33:31.879 --> 33:34.447
BUT I'M GONNA TRY.

33:49.244 --> 33:51.029

ENOUGH TO GET ME

THE EIGHTH-PLACE POSITION
ON OUR TEAM RANKINGS.

33:54.249 --> 33:56.382

THAT LOSS HAD ON ME,

35:28.474 --> 35:33.827
I MEAN THE EFFECT
OF WATCHING MY DAD LOSE
A PIECE OF HIMSELF.

35:33.870 --> 35:36.177
