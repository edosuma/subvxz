01:05.158 --> 01:08.129
Boy, look at this.

01:14.125 --> 01:16.054
Pretty as ever. Ha!

01:16.085 --> 01:18.056
Exciting!

01:22.029 --> 01:24.083
Did you pack
your bowling ball collection in here?

01:24.114 --> 01:26.147
My God! He's in a good mood.

01:27.148 --> 01:30.120
Who do I love? Who do I love?
You know I love you.

01:30.151 --> 01:32.122
Yeah, I love you, too, Mom.

01:34.198 --> 01:37.180
Senior year? I mean, this is the one.

01:37.211 --> 01:39.245
They're all important but,
boy, this is the one

01:40.027 --> 01:43.124
that really takes you to the finish line.
What do I always tell you?

01:43.270 --> 01:46.168
- I got this.
- You got this.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.161
Tell you what I won't miss -
paying 28 grand a year.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.224
Dad!

01:50.256 --> 01:52.081
Don't listen to him.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.176
He just likes to squeeze the coin purse.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.221
I just love it here.

01:57.252 --> 02:00.047
I love being back at our alma mater,
right, honey?

02:00.078 --> 02:02.268
Well, technically, it's my alma mater.
You didn't graduate.

02:03.050 --> 02:05.094
He loves it.

02:06.136 --> 02:08.233
Boy, here come the waterworks.

02:08.264 --> 02:10.110
- Mom!
- You know what?

02:10.140 --> 02:14.114
I think I just need some cheese
or something. I'm a little snackish.

02:14.145 --> 02:16.283
OK, traffic. We got traffic.

02:17.065 --> 02:18.253
Aww.

02:18.285 --> 02:20.172
All right. We're gonna release, OK?

02:22.257 --> 02:24.249
You're a remarkable young lady.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.076
And my love for you is very, very fierce.

02:28.107 --> 02:31.235
What? I'm only 22 minutes away!

02:31.266 --> 02:33.310
That's 22 minutes too far for me.

02:34.092 --> 02:37.106
Have so much fun in Italy, guys.
It's gonna be amazing.

02:37.137 --> 02:38.273
Arrivederci! That's Italian.

02:38.305 --> 02:40.088
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.237
Save your receipts.
Just kidding, but save 'em.

02:42.268 --> 02:44.102
OK.

02:44.134 --> 02:46.104
Hatchback.

02:46.137 --> 02:48.274
Yup. Boy.

02:50.286 --> 02:52.111
Ciao, honey!

02:52.143 --> 02:53.196
Ciao!

02:53.310 --> 02:56.136
We're both fluent. I'm coming, Dan.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.242
Beep beep yourself, mister.

02:58.274 --> 03:01.350
Somebody trying to get me in the car
all to himself?

03:02.257 --> 03:05.208
Boy. Four weeks in Italy.?

03:05.239 --> 03:07.220
Are you ready? I'm ready.

03:07.251 --> 03:09.253
I've always enjoyed our staycations

03:09.285 --> 03:13.195
but I think I'm ready
for a little gondola ride with my fella.

03:13.226 --> 03:15.259
Wait, wait, wait!

03:15.291 --> 03:17.209
I wanna see our girl go in.

03:17.241 --> 03:20.171
Ho, look at that!

03:20.202 --> 03:21.371
Ho-ho!

03:23.258 --> 03:25.166
I want a divorce.

03:26.376 --> 03:28.378
- What?
- I want a divorce.

03:30.286 --> 03:32.329
God, it feels good to say that out loud.

03:32.361 --> 03:35.322
I wanna be completely transparent
with you, Deanna.

03:35.353 --> 03:38.190
I am in love with someone else.

03:39.326 --> 03:41.213
Who are you in love with?

03:41.245 --> 03:42.371
Marcie.

03:43.299 --> 03:45.186
Marcie Strong.

03:46.218 --> 03:47.386
The realtor?

03:48.314 --> 03:50.285
The one on the bus benches?

03:50.316 --> 03:53.173
She's also on a series
of small billboards downtown

03:53.205 --> 03:55.406
and she has a pretty respectable
social media following.

03:56.187 --> 03:57.262
My God!

03:57.293 --> 03:59.295
- Don't... Please...
- Don't touch me!

03:59.326 --> 04:02.194
- Stay in the car, please.
- I'm gonna be sick!

04:02.225 --> 04:05.374
Look, I know this seems mean but I'm
doing it to facilitate a clean break.

04:05.405 --> 04:09.253
Like ripping a Band-Aid off quickly.
This is better for you.

04:11.203 --> 04:14.258
Don't you dare tell me
that this is better for me.

04:14.393 --> 04:17.344
Also in the interests of
complete transparency,

04:17.375 --> 04:19.262
I'm gonna sell the house.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.296
You can't do that.
That's not how it works.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.299
Marcie already started the paperwork
and it's all in my name.

04:28.314 --> 04:31.432
Stop it! This is a lease.
We still have ten months' payments.

04:32.213 --> 04:34.341
- Stop it, please!
- I don't care if it's a lease.

04:35.415 --> 04:38.210
Please, get back in the car.

04:40.274 --> 04:41.432
That's gonna cost.

04:42.287 --> 04:44.247
We'll talk about this later.

04:44.278 --> 04:45.457
Just go, Dan.

04:46.239 --> 04:48.262
Now I gotta use Waze.

05:03.297 --> 05:05.436
23 years of marriage, just down the tubes.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.480
I mean, can you believe that?

05:08.261 --> 05:11.275
No. I'm just...
I'm so disappointed in Dan.

05:11.306 --> 05:14.455
And what's Maddie gonna do? I mean,
you've gotta cancel the trip to Italy.

05:15.415 --> 05:18.459
You know, I honest to God...
I didn't see it coming.

05:18.491 --> 05:21.400
You always hear that
but I didn't see it coming.

05:21.431 --> 05:23.412
Let me tell you this,
Dan doesn't deserve you.

05:23.443 --> 05:25.456
You're such a great lady, Deanna.

05:25.487 --> 05:28.480
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

05:29.262 --> 05:32.484
This is it. My parents' house
is just up here on the right.

05:35.476 --> 05:37.426
Thanks, Dale. And...

05:37.457 --> 05:39.481
From the bottom of my heart...

05:39.513 --> 05:41.515
I'm gonna give you a great Uber review.

05:42.296 --> 05:43.496
Well, I hope your day gets better, Deanna.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.456
I'm sure it will.

05:55.341 --> 05:57.499
Can I make you a sandwich?

05:57.531 --> 06:01.326
No, thanks, Mom.
I'm just... I'm not hungry.

06:01.357 --> 06:04.454
What about a tuna salad sandwich
or egg salad?

06:04.485 --> 06:07.447
- You like egg salad.
- I do like egg salad.

06:07.478 --> 06:13.349
But, I promise you, I'll let you know,
but I'm really not hungry right now.

06:13.380 --> 06:16.436
Well, at least...
at least Marcie is attractive.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.459
- Mike!
- Dad! My God!

06:18.490 --> 06:22.379
What did I say? I mean,
it'd be even worse if she was homely.

06:22.411 --> 06:24.527
- No! No, it would not!
- Yeah, OK, well, you know what?

06:24.559 --> 06:26.508
That Dan, no good.

06:26.540 --> 06:30.377
I knew that the first time he tried
to make you drop out of college.

06:30.408 --> 06:35.392
What kind of man makes his pregnant wife
drop out of college with one year to go?

06:35.424 --> 06:37.415
Mike, lower your voice.

06:37.447 --> 06:39.365
You're upsetting Razzles.

06:39.396 --> 06:40.554
I'm sorry, Razzy.

06:41.336 --> 06:43.390
He didn't make me drop out of school.

06:43.421 --> 06:46.372
Dan and I decided that together.
We were having a baby!

06:46.403 --> 06:48.395
We needed to save money.

06:48.426 --> 06:51.388
We could only afford
one of us to finish school

06:51.419 --> 06:53.536
and he thought it was more important
that he went.

06:53.568 --> 06:55.382
- OK.
- OK?

06:55.413 --> 06:57.561
I was always supposed to go back.
It just never happened.

06:57.593 --> 07:00.377
You were just so close to graduating.

07:00.408 --> 07:02.483
I think it just kind of
sticks in his craw.

07:02.514 --> 07:05.580
- Yeah, it just sticks in my craw a bit.
- Yeah.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.385
I've got an idea, honey.

07:08.604 --> 07:11.419
What about a ham sandwich?

07:11.450 --> 07:14.380
Sandy, she doesn't want a ham sandwich.

07:14.412 --> 07:15.548
But she likes ham, Mike.

07:15.579 --> 07:18.603
Of course she likes ham.
Everybody likes ham!

07:19.385 --> 07:21.617
But the point is
that she's too upset to eat!

07:22.399 --> 07:25.402
You know what's upsetting me?
It's that my marriage has collapsed

07:25.433 --> 07:28.384
and you two keep screaming about ham!

07:28.415 --> 07:31.419
- I'm not screaming about ham.
- You are screaming about ham!

07:31.450 --> 07:33.609
- Yeah, stop it!
- You think I'm screaming about ham?

07:34.391 --> 07:35.632
Right now, your voice is going up
with "ham"!

07:36.414 --> 07:38.551
Fine! I'm screaming about ham!
I can't help it!

07:38.582 --> 07:41.481
I'm up on the roof there!
I'm blowing through the roof!

07:41.513 --> 07:45.475
I feel like... like I'm gonna blow
like a hot water heater!

07:45.506 --> 07:47.425
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go right now.

07:47.456 --> 07:50.459
I'm making everyone a sandwich.

07:51.648 --> 07:54.484
Mom, am I the only one
that didn't see it coming?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.621
Yeah. I'm gonna shoot Dan.

07:56.653 --> 07:58.425
- Mike.
- Yeah!

07:58.457 --> 08:00.604
Put the gun down.
You are not shooting Dan.

08:00.637 --> 08:02.534
Dad, stop waving that gun around.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.620
I know exactly what I'm gonna do.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.571
My gosh! You almost hit Razzles!

08:07.602 --> 08:09.594
Michael, you put a hole in the stairs!

08:09.625 --> 08:11.585
Shit!

08:11.616 --> 08:13.577
You know what? Dan's fault!

08:13.608 --> 08:15.641
This was Dan's fault.

You can't call this racquetball.

09:26.631 --> 09:28.550
That's a disgrace to the game.

09:28.685 --> 09:31.553
You know what?
I know I fought you on it

09:31.584 --> 09:33.721
but thank you for getting me
out of the house.

09:33.753 --> 09:35.755
Come on. What do you
think best friends are for?

09:36.537 --> 09:37.715
Hey! Hey!

09:37.746 --> 09:40.582
Excuse me,
there's no alcohol on the courts.

09:40.624 --> 09:42.616
Suck it, Eugene!

09:42.647 --> 09:43.731
Go easy on the kid?

09:43.763 --> 09:45.733
You know what?
How many of those have you had?

09:45.766 --> 09:48.674
- I had three on the way over here.
- Yeah.

09:48.706 --> 09:50.656
I made Frank drive me.

09:51.626 --> 09:54.629
- You've had four here. You've had seven?
- I've had seven.

09:54.660 --> 09:56.714
What are we supposed to do,
wait around here all day?

09:56.745 --> 10:00.635
OK, let's just show them how it's done,
OK?

10:03.554 --> 10:05.588
- My God!
- I'm sorry.

10:05.619 --> 10:07.569
Right in the lady business.

10:07.652 --> 10:09.560
It's not funny!

10:09.592 --> 10:11.562
- Shut up!
- It's not funny.

10:11.594 --> 10:15.556
- My! That's like a pain.
- I'm really sorry.

10:15.587 --> 10:20.623
I think I was thinking about Dan's face
or maybe... his crotchal area.

10:20.655 --> 10:22.615
- No, but you're good.
- I kind of let loose.

10:22.646 --> 10:23.805
You got good aim. Wow!

10:24.586 --> 10:26.651
What am I doing? I am drinking alcohol

10:26.683 --> 10:28.737
on a racquetball court
and yelling at old men.

10:28.768 --> 10:30.582
I mean, what am I gonna do?

10:30.614 --> 10:33.762
Go get a studio apartment
or start taking spin classes?

10:33.794 --> 10:36.630
God! I don't wanna start a blog.

10:36.661 --> 10:39.612
- I don't know how to do that.
- Please don't do that.

10:42.688 --> 10:44.815
I should have just fought more.

10:45.597 --> 10:47.724
- You know?
- Don't do that to yourself.

10:47.756 --> 10:49.716
You did great.

10:49.747 --> 10:51.666
What about Maddie?

10:52.761 --> 10:54.794
- She's so great.
- She's so great.

10:54.825 --> 10:57.776
I don't regret that at all, I mean...

10:57.808 --> 10:59.810
That's the best, I mean, being her mom.

10:59.842 --> 11:01.833
I even liked being a wife.

11:02.614 --> 11:04.628
I just wanted to also have a career.

11:04.659 --> 11:07.631
I didn't see why I couldn't
have all of those things.

11:07.787 --> 11:11.739
Hey, yo! We don't have time
for your heartfelt conversations!

11:12.636 --> 11:13.835
They're so ornery.

11:14.617 --> 11:16.765
OK, let's razzle-dazzle, and show...

11:16.796 --> 11:19.862
- God, we have to move again?
- ..show the Muppet judges, right?

11:20.644 --> 11:22.698
My sciatica's kicking.

11:22.729 --> 11:24.742
God! Wow!

11:24.773 --> 11:26.869
The pain, it's blinding!

11:27.651 --> 11:29.872
I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry I did that.
I didn't mean to hit you.

11:30.654 --> 11:33.751
You don't need to apologise to me.
Just apologise to my vagina.

11:35.742 --> 11:37.776
I'm so sorry.

11:37.808 --> 11:39.663
Stacey accepts your apology.

11:39.695 --> 11:41.749
- Who's Stacey?
- She's my vagina.

11:41.780 --> 11:44.752
You know what? I shouldn't say anything.
Mine is LeVonne.

11:44.783 --> 11:47.766
- What?
- I thought it sounded French.

11:52.896 --> 11:54.835
My God.

11:56.743 --> 11:57.848
Ho!

12:04.751 --> 12:06.774
That was not good hair.

12:07.702 --> 12:09.914
Too short. Too short, Deanna.

12:35.700 --> 12:36.774
A-boo!

12:36.805 --> 12:38.797
- God!
- Mom!

12:38.828 --> 12:41.821
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to actually scare you.

12:41.852 --> 12:43.770
- Hi!
- Surprise!

12:43.802 --> 12:45.752
What are you doing here?

12:45.783 --> 12:48.954
Well, I was just bringing you
some mini toiletries

12:49.735 --> 12:52.749
and I got you some more of that shampoo
that I know you like so much.

12:52.780 --> 12:55.752
Mom, I've only been here a week.
I don't need more shampoo.

12:55.783 --> 12:58.932
I always think everyone
can use shampoo

12:58.964 --> 13:02.811
and floss and frozen vegetable medleys.

13:02.843 --> 13:04.845
Always a good thing to have around.

13:04.876 --> 13:08.807
That's why I stopped by
and also to tell you that

13:08.838 --> 13:10.934
your father and I are getting a divorce.

13:10.965 --> 13:13.770
But if you want me
to take the shampoo back...

13:13.801 --> 13:14.927
Wait, what?

13:15.981 --> 13:17.899
Yeah, honey.

13:19.922 --> 13:22.748
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to just blurt that out.

13:22.779 --> 13:23.854
I'm sorry.

13:23.885 --> 13:25.782
- My God!
- Come here.

13:26.993 --> 13:29.798
I didn't mean to do it like that.

13:29.829 --> 13:32.988
You know that this has nothing to do
with how much we love you.

13:33.770 --> 13:37.795
Because we love you.
We love you so much. So much, OK?

13:38.796 --> 13:39.901
My God.

13:40.923 --> 13:42.008
What happened?

13:42.790 --> 13:44.854
I guess in a nutshell, I would have to say

13:44.886 --> 13:48.827
that he is currently
having an intimate sexual relationship

13:48.858 --> 13:50.016
with somebody named Marcie.

13:50.798 --> 13:51.986
I'm so sorry, Mom.

13:52.018 --> 13:54.864
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

13:54.896 --> 13:55.969
I mean, this was not my plan.

13:56.002 --> 14:01.904
I did not mean to come over here
and just dump bad news on you.

14:01.935 --> 14:03.885
I wish I was...

14:03.916 --> 14:05.866
I wish I knew how to do this better.

14:05.897 --> 14:07.034
Dad is such an ass!

14:07.816 --> 14:09.818
Yeah. But I'll tell you this.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.040
I'm not even really a full week in
but I'm feeling...

14:14.833 --> 14:15.918
..peppier about it.

14:15.949 --> 14:17.044
Top of the week was... Whoo!

14:17.826 --> 14:20.933
..really, really spiralling down there
but I feel like

14:20.964 --> 14:23.946
there's some big wheels in motion here.

14:23.978 --> 14:27.867
Exciting, big, semi-truck-size wheels.

14:27.898 --> 14:29.859
Yes, big wheels!

14:29.890 --> 14:32.028
Come on, seize the day! Go for the gold!

14:32.060 --> 14:34.990
Yeah, at least medal, right?

14:35.021 --> 14:38.921
That's why I'm gonna go back to college
and get my archaeology degree.

14:38.952 --> 14:40.985
Right here, my alma mater.

14:41.016 --> 14:43.050
I'm gonna finish what I started!

14:43.832 --> 14:44.927
- No.
- Yes!

14:44.958 --> 14:47.940
Mom, you really gotta take a moment
and think about this.

14:48.910 --> 14:51.913
I love it.

14:51.944 --> 14:54.905
OK. Boy.

14:56.918 --> 14:58.013
Boy.

14:58.044 --> 15:00.891
I overwhelmed my gal.

15:00.922 --> 15:02.955
Mom came in and overwhelmed her.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.029
Yes, I did.

15:04.060 --> 15:07.096
No, this is... this is good news.

15:07.877 --> 15:09.900
Yeah, good news..

15:09.931 --> 15:11.068
Good news.

15:11.976 --> 15:14.979
I'll tell you what. I would hate
to have to clean all these spindles.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.106
- I think you could do it.
- I know I could.

15:18.034 --> 15:19.869
You doing OK?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.892
- Yeah, I'll be OK.
- OK. I know.

15:21.923 --> 15:23.967
Yeah, you're a tough cookie.

15:26.052 --> 15:28.023
Hey! Hello!

15:28.054 --> 15:30.056
Look who's here. The gang's all here.

15:30.087 --> 15:32.882
- Hi!
- Hi, Mrs Miles!

15:32.913 --> 15:35.885
Look at this. It's a study group.
Study buddies already.

15:35.916 --> 15:38.012
- You should be down here studying.
- Please stop, Mom.

15:38.127 --> 15:41.067
Look at you.
Boy, a sight for sore eyes?

15:41.098 --> 15:44.967
Hello to my fellow Tigers,
fellow students,

15:44.998 --> 15:48.898
because somebody's mom
just enrolled in college!

15:48.930 --> 15:50.995
I'm referring to myself.

15:51.026 --> 15:52.955
Wait, you're going to school here now?

15:52.986 --> 15:55.113
She's thinking about it.
It's not for sure yet.

15:55.145 --> 15:58.116
It's pretty for sure.
I don't think I'm gonna change my mind.

15:58.148 --> 16:02.120
And, you know, it made me start wondering
when I was signing up today.

16:02.152 --> 16:07.021
I thought, "Wasn't Amanda talking about
switching to the archaeology department?"

16:07.052 --> 16:09.982
- Was that you?
- No, I'm art history.

16:10.014 --> 16:11.161
No. How about you?

16:11.943 --> 16:12.985
No, it's not me.

16:13.017 --> 16:16.927
No. I'm so sorry, we haven't met.
I haven't had the pleasure.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.991
- I'm Helen. Hi!
- Did I get lucky?

16:19.023 --> 16:22.954
Are you possibly an archaeology major?
There's usually two of us in a room.

16:22.985 --> 16:24.164
I'm undeclared.

16:24.946 --> 16:26.156
There's still time.

16:26.938 --> 16:28.074
There's still time. Check into it.

16:28.106 --> 16:30.984
Now, I couldn't help noticing

16:31.015 --> 16:33.173
that you're a little whisper older
than the other girls.

16:33.955 --> 16:36.103
Are you a TA or maybe a grad student?

16:36.134 --> 16:39.148
No, I'm a sophomore.
But I started college a little bit later

16:39.179 --> 16:41.108
because I was in a coma for eight years.

16:41.139 --> 16:43.027
My gosh!

16:43.058 --> 16:46.989
If I may, I'm just wondering,
how did it... how did that happen?

16:47.020 --> 16:48.167
Yes, I was skydiving.

16:48.199 --> 16:50.003
Boy!

16:50.034 --> 16:52.171
One minute you're falling out of
a plane, then the lights go out.

16:52.204 --> 16:54.987
Next thing I know, I wake up.
I think it's the next day

16:55.018 --> 16:57.209
but I've grown four inches
and suddenly I have C cups.

16:57.990 --> 16:59.106
It was eight years gone.

16:59.138 --> 17:02.130
I also have C cups. But I didn't have
to go into a coma for them.

17:02.161 --> 17:05.039
Mom! I think that's your cue.

17:05.070 --> 17:07.114
I think, maybe, you've gotta hit the road.

17:07.146 --> 17:09.157
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

17:09.189 --> 17:13.214
Yes. Put a fork in me. I'm done. So sorry.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.060
I'm gonna toddle off, on that note.

17:16.092 --> 17:17.145
So nice meeting you.

17:17.175 --> 17:21.055
So nice to meet you, Helen.
Girls, what a delight to see you again.

17:21.087 --> 17:23.162
OK, all right.

17:23.193 --> 17:27.093
Well, I'll see you around campus
or on the quad.

17:27.124 --> 17:29.105
- Nobody says that, Mom.
- Nobody says that?

17:29.136 --> 17:31.223
I'll bring it back.
See you in the quad, Tigers.

17:32.004 --> 17:33.100
Bye, Mrs Miles!

17:33.131 --> 17:35.123
And welcome.

17:36.769 --> 17:38.906
Sugar Dyed

17:40.962 --> 17:43.755
So, here's your class schedule.

17:43.786 --> 17:45.862
Wow! I am pumped!

17:45.894 --> 17:47.969
- Thank you so much!
- You're so welcome.

17:49.752 --> 17:51.837
- All right, take care.
- Bye now.

17:51.868 --> 17:54.788
I already got senioritis. Kidding!

17:55.768 --> 17:56.811
Yes!

17:56.967 --> 17:58.969
♪ Ain't nobody, ain't nobody

18:00.888 --> 18:02.963
♪ Gonna steal my brand-new groove

18:03.745 --> 18:05.789
Ooh! Yes!

18:07.895 --> 18:09.991
♪ I'm about to lose my cool

18:11.909 --> 18:13.911
♪ I need you, babe

18:16.905 --> 18:19.929
Did you see these in there?
They're tiny footballs!

18:19.960 --> 18:22.942
- Aren't they so cute?
- No idea what I'm gonna do with them.

18:22.973 --> 18:26.884
I guess I'll find tiny football players.

18:29.907 --> 18:32.806
Let me just get my grip.

18:33.828 --> 18:34.985
You're a sight for sore eyes.

18:35.017 --> 18:37.863
If you could just maybe grab that...

18:38.885 --> 18:40.877
I guess chivalry's dead.

18:40.908 --> 18:43.817
Wearing sweatpants in broad daylight.

18:43.848 --> 18:45.788
There's another one.

18:45.819 --> 18:47.998
Future Dans of America.

18:52.805 --> 18:53.912
Hello?

18:54.849 --> 18:56.809
Hi!...

19:03.025 --> 19:05.006
Don't turn on the lights.

19:07.873 --> 19:09.823
Hi, there.

19:10.053 --> 19:15.026
I'm Deanna
and you must be Lenore or is it Leonor?

19:18.978 --> 19:21.919
OK, well, I'm sure we'll get into that.

19:22.941 --> 19:24.880
So we're roomies?

19:25.026 --> 19:27.018
Fun to be roomies.

19:27.050 --> 19:28.926
Bunkmates.

19:30.886 --> 19:33.014
It's dark in here. Were you asleep?

19:33.045 --> 19:35.902
I don't sleep. I'm scared of the dark.

19:35.934 --> 19:37.988
Boy.

19:38.019 --> 19:42.044
I'm scared of a lot of things.
I'm scared of crowds, books, flying,

19:42.075 --> 19:44.964
people, ants, ketchup.

19:44.995 --> 19:46.934
Ketchup's a tough one for me.

19:46.966 --> 19:52.023
I mean, I like a moutarde
but I'm kind of a ketchup gal.

19:52.054 --> 19:54.045
I like to dunk my taters.

19:54.077 --> 19:56.047
OK. I like that.

19:56.923 --> 20:00.051
OK, well, we are gonna get along
just great.

20:01.981 --> 20:03.962
Look at that spring back.

20:03.993 --> 20:07.904
I'll tell you what,
I did not expect that kind of resilience.

20:15.099 --> 20:17.977
First day at school!

20:18.008 --> 20:19.092
Shut up!
- Sorry.

20:19.124 --> 20:21.011
First day at school.

20:21.939 --> 20:24.973
Hey, guys. Go Tigers, right?

20:25.098 --> 20:27.027
Man.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.092
I want it. Yes!

20:29.123 --> 20:32.095
I'd love a brainstorming session,
I've got one.

20:32.126 --> 20:34.086
Hit it high! There we go.

20:34.952 --> 20:36.036
Hey, Mondays?

20:37.965 --> 20:40.073
This is amazing!

20:55.056 --> 20:58.018
OK. Let's do this.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.061
Good seats. Good pick.

21:00.093 --> 21:03.033
I'm gonna go a little further up
because of my progressives.

21:03.064 --> 21:05.953
You want a study buddy?
I'll give you my landline.

21:05.984 --> 21:08.038
Maybe we could kind of...!

21:08.069 --> 21:09.164
- Hi!
- Hi!

21:09.998 --> 21:13.001
I hate to do this.
God, there's always that one, right?

21:13.033 --> 21:15.035
It's, like, "I gotta sit
in the centre-centre."

21:15.066 --> 21:17.986
Ooh, look at you. Real big feet.

21:19.061 --> 21:21.188
Sorry, let me give you that back.
You got it.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.044
- Hi!
- Hi.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.077
Hi, there. God, I'm sorry.

21:25.108 --> 21:27.048
Sorry. I apologise.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.051
You got hit by school spirit.

21:30.082 --> 21:33.137
Wow! Look at you, all decked out.

21:33.168 --> 21:36.088
You know what?
I am excited to be in this class.

21:36.119 --> 21:39.133
Now, I have to say,
I'm surprised to see you in here.

21:39.164 --> 21:43.053
Well, after I met you,
I watched Indiana Jones.

21:43.085 --> 21:44.993
The best.

21:45.024 --> 21:48.017
- Then, scuttlebutt on the street is...
- What is that?

21:48.048 --> 21:51.020
Everything's already been dug up,
so this is a really easy class.

21:51.051 --> 21:52.167
No, I gotta agree to disagree.

21:52.199 --> 21:55.170
But good news,
this means we're both Jurassic junkies.

21:57.214 --> 21:59.164
Look at this place..

21:59.195 --> 22:01.072
Boy.

22:03.001 --> 22:06.025
Excuse me, I think your bag's got
a case of the dropsies.

22:06.056 --> 22:08.142
It went through the chute there.

22:08.173 --> 22:12.135
Farther in than I thought.
You know what?

22:12.167 --> 22:13.168
That tip.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.232
The little tip of that cracked right off.

22:16.014 --> 22:19.080
But, luckily for you, I got a whole
haul of mechanical pencils

22:19.111 --> 22:21.144
so the lead keeps replenishing
as you twist.

22:21.176 --> 22:23.241
You want in on this?

22:24.022 --> 22:26.066
- No, thank you.
- No?

22:26.171 --> 22:28.142
But I love your sweater.

22:30.102 --> 22:33.053
Thank you so much.
Yeah, I thought it really popped.

22:33.084 --> 22:34.263
Yeah, I was kidding.

22:35.045 --> 22:36.181
It's a horrible sweater.

22:36.212 --> 22:39.184
It's a horrible, super-sad mom sweater.

22:43.147 --> 22:45.055
OK.

22:45.086 --> 22:46.202
I see we're still doing that.

22:46.233 --> 22:50.091
Girls being mean to other girls
for no apparent reason.

22:50.122 --> 22:55.096
There is a reason. You're not a girl,
you're 1,000 years old.

22:55.127 --> 22:57.286
You're ancient. A relic.

22:58.172 --> 23:00.195
She's pleased with herself over that one.

23:00.227 --> 23:05.086
Well, guess what? If I'm a relic,
then I guess I'm in the right class.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.099
Whoo!

23:07.130 --> 23:08.245
Swoosh.

23:08.277 --> 23:10.237
It's an archaeology jam.

23:10.268 --> 23:14.210
Who made jam out of that mess of berries?
Me.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.160
Good afternoon, everyone.

23:16.191 --> 23:20.132
Welcome to Archaeology 301.

23:21.154 --> 23:22.187
My God.

23:22.218 --> 23:24.282
I think that's Wayne Truzack.

23:24.314 --> 23:27.254
He was a classmate of mine 20 years ago.

23:27.285 --> 23:32.238
First of all, I wanna tell you that your
satisfaction in this class is guaranteed

23:32.269 --> 23:35.179
or you'll get double your mummy back.

23:40.268 --> 23:42.166
"Mummy back."

23:42.197 --> 23:44.272
I don't get why that's funny.

23:44.303 --> 23:47.265
It is funny but it's also punny.

23:48.234 --> 23:51.112
Hey, freaks, shut up!

24:00.173 --> 24:01.299
No! No! No!

24:08.234 --> 24:10.131
No. No. No.

24:19.162 --> 24:21.164
I brought snacks!

24:24.157 --> 24:27.139
I don't know. I'm loving my classes.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.339
They're amazing. I feel like I'm learning.

24:29.370 --> 24:32.196
I think I felt for so long like
my brain was in a freezer

24:32.227 --> 24:34.250
and now I've really come room temp.

24:34.281 --> 24:35.366
It's just great!

24:36.148 --> 24:38.358
- Can I say something?
- You could say whatever you want, Debbie.

24:38.390 --> 24:41.351
- You don't have to ask.
- Thanks, Amanda.

24:41.382 --> 24:44.302
I think it's really great
you had something bad happen to you

24:44.333 --> 24:46.399
and that you're making lemons
out of lemonade.

24:47.305 --> 24:51.216
I think you did kind of flip-flop
that saying.

24:51.247 --> 24:53.228
It's supposed to be
"lemonade out of lemons".

24:53.260 --> 24:56.356
You take something sour
and you turn it into something sweet.

24:56.388 --> 24:59.287
Pretty sure it's
"make lemons out of lemonade".

24:59.318 --> 25:02.196
It's kind of the idea that
something bad happened to you,

25:02.227 --> 25:06.210
like your husband leaving you
and squashing you to make lemonade.

25:06.241 --> 25:09.349
Then pulling yourself back together again
and now you're a whole lemon.

25:09.380 --> 25:13.280
That was a very visual story.

25:13.311 --> 25:15.355
Very painful visual

25:15.386 --> 25:20.297
but then the whole lemon really does
bring it back around to the flip side.

25:20.328 --> 25:21.403
So thank you for that.

25:21.435 --> 25:25.260
I appreciate the sentiment
and I appreciate these cheeks.

25:25.293 --> 25:28.244
My God! I can't let go!

25:28.275 --> 25:30.266
Deanna, you wanna stick around
and hang out?

25:30.298 --> 25:33.415
I would love to hang.
My first college hang.

25:33.447 --> 25:37.211
I am free as a bird. I'm down to clown.

25:37.242 --> 25:39.265
Deanna's such a mouthful.

25:39.296 --> 25:40.422
What if I called you Dee Dee?

25:41.277 --> 25:43.238
I have always wanted a nickname.

25:43.269 --> 25:45.313
What about Dee Rock or Dee Train?

25:45.344 --> 25:46.387
Or Glenn?

25:46.418 --> 25:48.295
Why would we call her Glenn?

25:48.326 --> 25:52.341
Just cos I love Glenn Close
and I was thinking about her.

25:52.372 --> 25:54.447
- I love Glenn Close.
- You do?

25:55.229 --> 25:56.365
Fatal Attraction, best movie ever.

25:56.397 --> 25:58.452
- That the one where she boiled a rabbit?
- It is.

25:59.233 --> 26:02.267
I think I showed that to Maddie
a little too early on

26:02.299 --> 26:04.395
because she urinated in her underpants.

26:04.426 --> 26:05.427
Mom!

26:05.459 --> 26:09.484
And would not eat anything out of a stew
pot for a good six to eight months.

26:10.266 --> 26:14.311
Or she would just keep re-urinating
in her underpants.

26:14.343 --> 26:15.365
Mom, stop!

26:15.396 --> 26:18.263
Let's watch it.
Let's rent it. Movie night.

26:18.295 --> 26:21.277
Yeah, you know...
I love a good movie night.

26:21.308 --> 26:25.281
But I think...
my mom does not want to hang out here.

26:25.312 --> 26:29.264
She's just stopping by. She's not gonna
hang out with her daughter's friends.

26:29.295 --> 26:31.507
That would be so weird.
That would be weird.

26:33.278 --> 26:36.397
Maddie's right.
I can't hang out right now.

26:36.428 --> 26:40.349
I've gotta get home and get in some
good hang time with my new roomie.

26:40.380 --> 26:43.414
- What's her name?
- You know what? It's Leonor or Lenore.

26:43.446 --> 26:44.457
I'm not really sure.

26:44.488 --> 26:47.502
We're just kind of getting used
to each other, I'm sure.

26:48.284 --> 26:50.463
She kind of mutters around the room,
talking to herself.

26:50.494 --> 26:54.373
I just kind of get a Voldemort vibe
from her.

26:54.405 --> 26:58.294
But I will take a rain check on the movie,
if that... Or not.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.379
- Rain check.
- OK. Rain check.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.432
Aw!

27:01.464 --> 27:04.425
I'll make the popcorn.
I got a sweet and savoury one.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.488
- Great!
- Bye.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.324
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Dee Rock.

27:07.355 --> 27:08.471
- She's amazing.
- Yeah.

27:08.503 --> 27:12.392
That was very nice of her
to bring food for you guys.

27:12.424 --> 27:14.405
I love your mom.

27:14.436 --> 27:17.501
Last thing. You're not gonna...
Thunder dunder clouds up ahead.

27:17.533 --> 27:20.484
And I just said rain check.
It's like I conjured it.

27:20.515 --> 27:24.404
- Great.
- OK. Bye-bye. Last hug.

27:24.436 --> 27:25.457
- OK.
- I love you.

27:25.489 --> 27:27.376
Look at her dancing me out!

27:27.407 --> 27:29.347
We're like Fred and... OK.

27:35.457 --> 27:37.417
You're a bookworm?

27:39.357 --> 27:41.515
My God. How long have you been there?

27:41.546 --> 27:43.413
Six minutes.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.566
You're a quiet one.

27:50.347 --> 27:51.484
You get good grades?

27:51.516 --> 27:53.403
...well...

27:53.434 --> 27:57.376
I try. I really enjoy
the subject matter and...

27:57.407 --> 28:00.420
I don't know,
I just find archaeology a constant wonder.

28:00.452 --> 28:03.455
You like to dig up stuff?
I like to bury stuff.

28:03.486 --> 28:05.363
OK.

28:05.394 --> 28:07.594
Look at us! Kind of yin and yang...

28:08.376 --> 28:10.608
having our first conversation?

28:11.390 --> 28:12.464
Fun.

28:12.495 --> 28:16.551
Listen, while we're gabbing,
I was just kind of wondering...

28:16.582 --> 28:19.439
It's been a few weeks.

28:19.471 --> 28:21.588
I'm thinking, "I wonder if she's ever
gonna go...

28:21.620 --> 28:24.392
outside the room?"

28:24.424 --> 28:27.521
Maybe for a class or a...
you know, a coven meeting.

28:28.470 --> 28:29.513
I'm kidding.

28:29.544 --> 28:31.546
I've gone on the other side of that door.

28:31.577 --> 28:32.589
Yeah...

28:32.620 --> 28:35.571
I find you behind that door all the time

28:35.602 --> 28:38.397
but that's inside my closet.

28:38.428 --> 28:40.451
So, I was just wondering...

28:40.482 --> 28:45.519
are you ever gonna go out of maybe
that door... into the, let's say, hallway?

28:45.644 --> 28:48.407
I'll probably stick to that door.

28:48.438 --> 28:50.419
- You wanna stick to my closet?
- Yeah.

28:50.451 --> 28:51.566
OK.

28:52.588 --> 28:54.590
I like you.

28:57.437 --> 28:58.564
And we're friends.

28:58.595 --> 29:00.440
I certainly hope so.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.629
I'm might go back to my room.

29:03.548 --> 29:04.601
OK.

29:11.608 --> 29:14.486
Wow! That smells great. What is that?

29:14.517 --> 29:16.644
Yes, it's Fiori Antichi Della Novella.

29:16.676 --> 29:18.667
Remember? We got it a Firenze.

29:19.449 --> 29:20.669
Mi piace.

29:21.451 --> 29:22.619
- It turns me on.
- Yeah.

29:28.448 --> 29:29.626
What is that smell?

29:30.533 --> 29:33.515
It's probably garlic and Dial.

29:33.547 --> 29:35.486
And a little mayo.

29:35.518 --> 29:37.500
I had an Italian sandwich.

29:37.531 --> 29:38.688
They're lovers.

29:39.470 --> 29:40.628
No, they're not. They're jealous.

29:40.659 --> 29:42.692
No, we're best... best friends.

29:43.474 --> 29:45.612
- Yes.
- I can't believe you brought her.

29:45.643 --> 29:47.676
I can't believe you brought Christine.

29:47.708 --> 29:50.596
I can't believe you shacked up
with a bitch!

29:50.627 --> 29:51.680
Hey! Hey!

29:51.712 --> 29:54.715
- That is not gonna be useful today.
- This bitch...

29:55.497 --> 29:57.561
has a lot of reason to be here.

29:57.593 --> 30:00.564
I am an excellent negotiator.
I am a realtor.

30:00.596 --> 30:03.578
Yes. Not only do you destroy homes,
you also sell them.

30:03.609 --> 30:05.695
- Isn't that come full circle?
- Good burn!

30:05.727 --> 30:07.519
OK.

30:07.550 --> 30:08.698
Hello, all. As you know,

30:08.730 --> 30:12.713
this mediation is here to help facilitate
the terms of your divorce.

30:13.495 --> 30:14.663
So, just so you know,

30:14.694 --> 30:16.613
this is not a court of law, all right?

30:16.644 --> 30:20.658
You will all be civilised and you will
please address all speech to me.

30:20.689 --> 30:21.743
- To you.
- To you.

30:22.525 --> 30:23.609
- No crosstalk.
- No.

30:23.640 --> 30:27.676
Even if we wanna talk to one another,
we can't. If I wanted to say, "Dina..."

30:27.707 --> 30:30.512
- You'd look at me.
- I'd look at you, I'd say, "Dina...

30:30.543 --> 30:33.619
I am going to have...
a beautiful life with your husband...

30:33.650 --> 30:34.672
Dina."

30:34.703 --> 30:38.614
- If I were to say, "Marky..."
- Marcie.

30:38.645 --> 30:41.533
"..you're gonna be very disappointed
in bed

30:41.565 --> 30:43.672
cos Dan's downstairs
is not gonna do the trick."

30:45.663 --> 30:48.666
I don't know why you're laughing.
Frank's not great downstairs, either.

30:48.698 --> 30:50.689
To me.
- We play tennis together.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.640
- Frank is no big deal down there.
- He's right. Frank is not.

30:53.671 --> 30:54.766
I have a question, Dan.

30:55.548 --> 30:58.708
Why is it that you're playing tennis
with Frank pantsless?

30:58.739 --> 31:01.679
- This is not helping our process.
- Thank you.

31:01.711 --> 31:05.663
- OK. Can we proceed?
- She's not signing anything, Your Honour.

31:05.694 --> 31:06.716
If I may.

31:06.747 --> 31:09.656
I'm not a judge. Remember,
I said this isn't a court of law.

31:10.615 --> 31:14.567
My name is Christine Davenport,
good friend to Deanna.

31:14.599 --> 31:15.745
And I am here as a support.

31:15.777 --> 31:22.670
And also I have been studying
lots of documents on legalzoom.com.

31:22.701 --> 31:25.621
Thank you. Thank you for that.
I just want to get this over with.

31:25.652 --> 31:26.674
Terrifying!

31:26.705 --> 31:32.649
I want it on the record that the accused
are currently in the process

31:32.680 --> 31:37.706
of selling my client's home...
and not splitting the proceeds.

31:37.737 --> 31:42.826
Because the house was 100 per cent
in Daniel's name. So...

31:43.608 --> 31:46.600
That was our house, Dan.
You know that was our house.

31:46.632 --> 31:49.791
I understand, but we're gonna settle this,
and that's why we're here, OK?

31:49.822 --> 31:51.668
- Daniel...
- Don't interject.

31:51.699 --> 31:53.765
- Don't be a weenie.
- I'm not being a weenie.

31:53.796 --> 31:55.641
- OK...
- I'm not being a weenie.

31:55.672 --> 31:57.842
Well, that's debatable. This is not...

31:58.624 --> 31:59.750
This is not helping our process.

31:59.781 --> 32:03.702
There is no probable clause
to implicate this witness.

32:03.733 --> 32:05.641
I move to dismiss.

32:05.672 --> 32:09.697
I just want to say for the record, I just
needed an upgrade in my life, Deanna.

32:09.729 --> 32:11.856
- You son of a...
OK. To me, please.

32:12.638 --> 32:14.650
I'm sorry. You son of a bitch.

32:14.681 --> 32:17.643
- No, you're the son of a bitch.
- You're the son of a bitch!

32:17.674 --> 32:19.739
- You're the son of a bitch.
- I object!

32:19.770 --> 32:21.866
I object! I'm not even a judge. OK?

32:22.648 --> 32:23.795
I'm just gonna take...

32:23.826 --> 32:26.683
I'm just gonna take a break.
Gotta strategise.

32:26.714 --> 32:27.788
Are you coming back?

32:27.819 --> 32:31.636
I refuse to disclose information
about my client.

32:33.764 --> 32:34.880
Case adjourned.

32:35.860 --> 32:37.726
Deanna!

32:37.758 --> 32:39.801
We know what room she's in.
We don't need to yell.

32:39.832 --> 32:42.669
- I like to yell!
- Let her yell.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.733
Guys, why are we going
to see my mom right now?

32:44.765 --> 32:46.892
Because we haven't seen her all week
and we miss her.

32:52.773 --> 32:53.899
Hey, Mom. What's up?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.673
Hey, what are you guys doing in here?

32:57.705 --> 32:59.665
What's wrong?

33:00.760 --> 33:02.803
We filed our paperwork today,

33:02.835 --> 33:06.755
so your dad and I are
officially getting divorced.

33:07.820 --> 33:09.718
My God! I'm so sorry.

33:09.749 --> 33:12.804
I'm sorry. I don't even like
talking to you about this stuff.

33:12.835 --> 33:14.743
No, don't worry at all.

33:14.775 --> 33:17.767
I just know he's gonna fight me
on, like, every little thing.

33:17.799 --> 33:19.853
So it's just...
it's a little frustrating is all.

33:19.884 --> 33:22.876
- That looks really good.
- Yeah, it used to be in a can.

33:22.908 --> 33:24.774
Can I say something?

33:24.806 --> 33:25.932
- Just say it, Debbie.
- Just say it.

33:26.714 --> 33:27.809
Yes, honey.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.832
We need to get you jackhammer blasted.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.847
I just am not really in the mood
to kind of, you know, hang out.

33:34.878 --> 33:37.871
- And I don't want to impose, so...
- Come on!

33:38.882 --> 33:40.728
You're not imposing, Mom.

33:40.759 --> 33:42.792
- I am imposing.
- No, you're not.

33:42.825 --> 33:43.951
You're not imposing.

33:44.732 --> 33:47.715
You just got some really rough news
and to be honest,

33:47.746 --> 33:48.893
we both got really rough news.

33:48.924 --> 33:52.835
But, you're in college now.
You gotta learn how to party through it.

33:52.866 --> 33:55.848
All right, girl.
I'm gonna go to a party with my mom.

33:55.879 --> 33:57.892
Let's do it. I'm gonna be that girl!

33:57.923 --> 34:00.790
Come on. I wanna...
♪ Party with my mama

34:00.822 --> 34:02.876
♪ We all wanna party with your mama

34:02.907 --> 34:06.817
♪ Party with your mama
Party with your mama

34:06.974 --> 34:10.873
- All right. I'm down to clown!
- Dee Rock's down to clown!

34:10.905 --> 34:12.938
I am also down to clown.
I'm always down to clown.

34:12.969 --> 34:14.972
It's just something that I do
all the time.

34:15.753 --> 34:16.964
- I like your vibe.
- Why?

34:21.061 --> 34:24.199
- It's pretty lively!
- Yeah, it's a party, Mom.

34:24.231 --> 34:26.233
Well, it's also a school night.

34:27.014 --> 34:29.141
Dee, I think those guys
just checked you out.

34:29.174 --> 34:31.030
- No, they weren't!
- Yes, they were.

34:31.061 --> 34:34.219
They're probably just looking at my smock.
It tends to catch the light.

34:34.252 --> 34:37.036
They're so young.

34:37.161 --> 34:39.100
I think I'm too old to be here.

34:39.132 --> 34:41.071
No, come on! It'll be so fun.

34:41.101 --> 34:43.262
Let's rock out with our lady dongs out.

34:44.043 --> 34:45.253
That's not a thing.

34:47.161 --> 34:49.027
Shots! Shots! Shots!

34:49.059 --> 34:52.062
- What do we want?
- Full velocity!

34:52.092 --> 34:54.063
Workin' On My Tan B*tch

34:54.094 --> 34:58.120
It's so loud in here!
I can barely hear myself think.

35:00.101 --> 35:01.144
Hey!

35:01.175 --> 35:04.105
There's your boyfriend.
Doesn't he look sharp?

35:04.137 --> 35:06.107
- Yeah, let's go get a drink.
- Stairs!

35:06.139 --> 35:07.181
Yep.

35:07.213 --> 35:10.174
I just wish you would have let me
bring a covered dish.

35:10.205 --> 35:14.053
- That would have been so weird.
- No, it's weird to not bring something.

35:14.084 --> 35:15.295
- Hell, no.
- Hell, no.

35:16.076 --> 35:19.079
Maddie, you're not bringing
old people to this party.

35:19.110 --> 35:21.290
Absolutely not. No moms allowed.

35:22.071 --> 35:25.169
I will break your face.
No-one will recognise you.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.172
You'll die in a ditch.

35:28.203 --> 35:30.132
OK, my mom needs a drink.

35:30.164 --> 35:33.250
So back up before I back you up!

35:34.189 --> 35:35.262
Hop out!

35:36.305 --> 35:39.256
I'm so proud of you for owning your power.

35:39.287 --> 35:41.164
Don't escalate it.

35:41.196 --> 35:43.156
But, wow! Impressive.

35:43.187 --> 35:45.252
God, I don't know what's sadder,

35:45.283 --> 35:49.172
the mom perm...or the mom boobs.

35:49.297 --> 35:53.155
Mom perm! I gotta tell... Time-out, guys.

35:53.187 --> 35:55.336
God-given curls.
All I'm doing is a little...

35:56.117 --> 35:58.339
maybe a foam mousse,
a little spray, hot roller

35:59.121 --> 36:01.164
and I set it, and I forget it.

36:01.196 --> 36:05.168
And secondly, these allowed this one
to suckle at these teats

36:05.200 --> 36:06.326
- for 28 wonderful...
- We're not...

36:07.108 --> 36:10.111
- We're not...
- ..wonderful tender months.

36:10.142 --> 36:13.301
- I wear them around my waist proudly.
- This isn't the time.

36:14.313 --> 36:16.169
I just feel like...

36:16.200 --> 36:19.360
I don't know if it's more pathetic
to party with your mom...

36:20.142 --> 36:22.206
or to party with your daughter.

36:23.207 --> 36:26.148
Come on. Let's do something cool.

36:26.179 --> 36:28.317
Real cool. Bye, nerds.

36:34.251 --> 36:37.243
OK, this was a lot of fun.

36:37.274 --> 36:41.299
Um, but I want you to enjoy yourselves
tonight, so I'm just gonna go.

36:41.330 --> 36:42.363
No, no, no.

36:43.145 --> 36:45.345
- We're gonna have a good time.
- I should not be here.

36:45.376 --> 36:48.244
This is not a party for me.

36:48.275 --> 36:50.194
If you go, evil wins!

36:50.225 --> 36:54.208
OK, you know what?
I have an idea. Let's go to the bathroom.

36:54.239 --> 36:56.273
- I don't have to tinkle.
- I think you do.

36:56.304 --> 37:00.245
I think I'd know if I had to tinkle.
Except that one time.

37:00.277 --> 37:03.165
All right. Let's go.

37:03.196 --> 37:05.188
Please tell me you're not doing
the cocaine.

37:05.219 --> 37:06.356
My God! No! Come on.

37:07.337 --> 37:11.257
No, I already told you.
I do not have to go to the bathroom.

37:11.289 --> 37:15.178
Mom, you're a college girl now
and we gotta make some changes.

37:15.418 --> 37:17.253
What does that mean?

37:17.284 --> 37:19.213
- Let's start with these glasses.
- No!

37:19.244 --> 37:21.267
- You gotta start wearing contact lenses.
- No!

37:21.299 --> 37:23.207
This is horrible!

37:23.238 --> 37:26.241
Then this, this is just...
Let's get this off.

37:26.272 --> 37:29.244
- Come on, Mom.
- My God! What has gotten into you?

37:29.275 --> 37:32.424
Don't fight it, Mom! It's like a Band-Aid.
You gotta rip it off quickly.

37:33.206 --> 37:35.427
- All I have on is my undershirt.
- Yeah!

37:36.314 --> 37:38.347
I'm gonna unbutton.

37:38.378 --> 37:40.349
Not one, not two...

37:40.381 --> 37:42.236
but three.

37:42.267 --> 37:44.281
Not three buttons, no!

37:44.312 --> 37:45.438
Look at your breasts!

37:46.220 --> 37:48.327
- Mom!
- What? I don't know what's happening.

37:48.358 --> 37:51.225
- Those are gorgeous!
- They're all right.

37:51.257 --> 37:54.353
Maybe how about we just do something
about that hair just a little bit?

37:54.385 --> 37:57.388
No! God, it's full of hair.

37:57.419 --> 38:00.224
Come on, it'll be fine. Let me have it.

38:00.255 --> 38:02.278
No! God, don't! No!

38:02.309 --> 38:05.375
Hey, what's up?
You're that girl in the coma, right?

38:05.406 --> 38:07.231
Not any more.

38:07.262 --> 38:10.255
- Yeah, I follow you on Twitter.
- I don't date fans.

38:11.370 --> 38:12.403
OK.

38:13.478 --> 38:15.301
So beautiful.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.367
God. Now I've got a bare...

38:17.398 --> 38:19.421
You know what I can't wear is a bare lip.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.362
What is that?

38:22.393 --> 38:24.270
It's mauve.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.274
You know I love mauve.

38:31.381 --> 38:34.467
No, I'm not a fan, I just...
I got a lot of respect for comas.

38:35.375 --> 38:37.408
I like sleeping pretty long, too, I guess.

38:39.462 --> 38:41.349
Whoa!

38:41.381 --> 38:43.351
God! Are you in a coma again?

38:43.383 --> 38:45.385
God, I gotta get help.

38:48.388 --> 38:49.483
Can I look? Can I look now?

38:49.515 --> 38:51.433
Yes! I think you're done.

38:56.449 --> 38:58.419
Hey! Wow!

38:59.441 --> 39:02.309
My God! "What are you, 20?"

39:02.444 --> 39:05.291
- OK. I wouldn't go that far.
- I'm 21.

39:05.322 --> 39:06.375
OK.

39:06.407 --> 39:08.450
You know,
I used to wear my hair like this.

39:08.481 --> 39:10.431
Eons ago...

39:10.463 --> 39:13.341
when you were in here.

39:13.372 --> 39:15.322
You look so beautiful, Mom.

39:15.488 --> 39:17.334
Wow!

39:17.365 --> 39:19.461
You know what? OK.

39:19.492 --> 39:21.422
I think you're ready, college girl.

39:22.423 --> 39:25.394
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, let's go. But let's leave this.

39:25.426 --> 39:28.335
Let's never touch...
or talk about that brush again.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.451
OK.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.464
- Thank you.
- Of course. I love you.

39:31.495 --> 39:33.445
I love you, too.

39:33.476 --> 39:34.498
Boom.

39:37.345 --> 39:38.471
- Hey.
- Hey!

39:40.473 --> 39:42.350
Get a room!

39:42.381 --> 39:45.447
Just kidding, don't. L-O-L. Hashtag.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.481
- Hey, Ms Miles.
- Hi, how are you?

39:48.512 --> 39:50.420
Good. You guys both look amazing!

39:50.452 --> 39:52.422
- Thank you.
- Charmer.

39:52.454 --> 39:54.476
I heard you're back at school now,
which is awesome.

39:54.508 --> 39:56.478
- It is.
- You get to party with all of us.

39:56.510 --> 39:57.563
Well...

39:58.345 --> 40:01.473
How about a drink or something?
Let me introduce you to my friend Jack.

40:01.504 --> 40:02.579
Hi, I'm Jack.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.560
Deanna. Hi.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.386
Wow, that's...

40:07.417 --> 40:10.379
You have wonderfully intricate hair.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.382
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

40:13.538 --> 40:15.530
Well, can I get you something to drink?

40:15.561 --> 40:20.545
OK. I would love a Chardonnay,
maybe something oaky.

40:21.515 --> 40:23.371
Um...

40:24.372 --> 40:25.540
Did you pick up the Chardonnay?

40:25.571 --> 40:30.388
- We have some boxed wine.
- We have some boxed wine.

40:30.420 --> 40:31.566
- In a box?
- I don't know.

40:31.598 --> 40:33.506
I'm sure it tastes real cardboardy.

40:33.537 --> 40:35.624
I'm sure it tastes very cardboardy!

40:36.405 --> 40:39.628
Really, it comes in a plastic bladder,
so it's not touching the cardboard.

40:40.409 --> 40:42.631
I told him we should not get anything
that comes in a bladder.

40:43.413 --> 40:46.426
- I'm the only one who likes wine.
- I love wine!

40:46.457 --> 40:48.574
But I don't like drinking it
out of bladders.

40:49.450 --> 40:50.586
I don't blame you.

40:51.515 --> 40:53.485
She'll just have a shot and a beer,
please.

40:53.517 --> 40:54.538
- Perfect.
- There we go.

40:54.570 --> 40:58.615
Why not? I'm here to get
the full college experience.

40:58.647 --> 41:01.650
So...what is the spirit du jour?

41:02.432 --> 41:04.590
This is 100 per cent agave tequila.

41:04.621 --> 41:08.490
Agave! I use that when I bake muffins.

41:08.521 --> 41:09.553
- OK.
- She loves to bake.

41:09.585 --> 41:11.503
- I do.
- All right, let's do it.

41:12.546 --> 41:15.665
- What do we want?
- Full velocity!

41:16.446 --> 41:18.553
And equal work for equal pay.

41:21.525 --> 41:23.464
God.

41:23.495 --> 41:25.633
- God.
- That is aggressive.

41:26.634 --> 41:28.553
That's just burning.

41:28.584 --> 41:30.659
It's burning all the way down.

41:31.441 --> 41:33.526
Just follow my lead
and we'll do this again, OK?

41:33.558 --> 41:36.540
We'll try it again.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.584
All right. What do we want?

41:39.616 --> 41:41.691
Full velocity!

41:42.473 --> 41:46.697
And cleaner oceans.
Our coral reefs are dying, guys.

41:47.613 --> 41:50.522
No, er...Ms Miles...

41:53.693 --> 41:59.564
Look, Ms Miles, coral reefs and equal
work for equal pay, all great things.

41:59.595 --> 42:00.711
But at our parties...

42:01.493 --> 42:05.705
when somebody says "What do we want?"
we just say "Full velocity."

42:06.487 --> 42:07.676
You don't need to say anything else.

42:07.707 --> 42:09.574
It's more of a party tradition.

42:09.605 --> 42:13.505
OK. So, it's just a flat answer of full...

42:13.724 --> 42:16.487
- Velocity.
- Velocity.

42:16.518 --> 42:18.593
- OK.
- You ready?

42:18.624 --> 42:20.491
Well...

42:20.522 --> 42:21.679
Third time's the charm, right?

42:21.711 --> 42:25.579
- What do we want?
- Full velocity!

42:25.611 --> 42:30.512
And full maternity leave
for non-gender-specific working parents.

42:32.566 --> 42:34.537
And full velocity!

42:46.758 --> 42:48.614
Where's my mom?

42:48.645 --> 42:51.554
She's over there busting it out.

42:54.557 --> 42:55.610
Hi, honey!

42:55.642 --> 42:57.612
Hi!

42:58.707 --> 43:01.649
I feel that in my C-section scar!

43:02.586 --> 43:03.734
- Are you OK?
- Ooh, yeah!

43:41.700 --> 43:43.733
You don't have to make a big deal.

43:43.764 --> 43:46.747
Don't jump to conclusions.
You don't know what's happening here.

43:46.778 --> 43:50.782
Really? It looks like my mother is doing
the walk of shame out of a frat house.

43:52.607 --> 43:55.766
OK, I guess technically that's...
what's happening. Let's just go.

43:55.797 --> 43:57.778
Let's get out of here. My God!

43:58.759 --> 44:00.802

Can we please just get out of here?

44:05.672 --> 44:06.840
Aren't they gonna serve breakfast?

44:07.622 --> 44:09.844
No, they're not gonna serve breakfast.
This isn't the Hilton.

44:10.625 --> 44:13.659
I knew that. But I thought maybe
they'll have a bagel spread or something.

44:13.690 --> 44:14.755
My God!

44:15.619 --> 44:18.800
My God!
My foot keeps charley horsing.

44:18.832 --> 44:21.710
I'm telling you,
I can't even get my boots back on.

44:21.741 --> 44:24.827
I guess that's what I get
for getting my toes curled last night.

44:24.859 --> 44:26.829
And I mean cu-urled.

44:26.861 --> 44:28.727
Mom, please stop!

44:28.758 --> 44:32.867
I think it was mutually enjoyable...
for both parties.

44:33.649 --> 44:34.858
I mean, I had fun.

44:35.640 --> 44:38.737
He enjoyed himself.
He kept yelling, "Please, more!"

44:38.768 --> 44:41.876
I thought he was doing a scene
from Oliver! "Please, more."

44:42.658 --> 44:44.743
I heard that through the wall

44:44.774 --> 44:46.809
and I thought he was
saying, "Cheese store."

44:46.840 --> 44:48.726
And I was very confused.

44:48.759 --> 44:51.751
One time we were playing
kind of a cheesemonger

44:51.782 --> 44:53.722
and I was a poor peasant girl but...

44:53.753 --> 44:54.890
That's disgusting, Mom.

44:55.672 --> 44:57.715
- No! It was fun.
- Mom!

44:57.747 --> 44:58.758
And I love cheese.

44:58.789 --> 45:00.708
I love you so much.

45:00.739 --> 45:03.826
Have I asked you once about any of this?
No. You just keep blabbing.

45:03.857 --> 45:07.684
I'm asking you to please be quiet
and stop talking.

45:07.715 --> 45:10.801
OK. I think we should keep
communication lines open.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.752
You know what? I'm older, I'm wiser.
I...

45:13.909 --> 45:16.755
This, essentially a Google.

45:17.725 --> 45:20.759
Right down here, where you came from.

45:20.791 --> 45:22.751
I'm like the Google of vaginas.

45:22.782 --> 45:24.837
"Ask me anything, please."

45:24.868 --> 45:26.682
Turn off your vagoogle.

45:26.714 --> 45:28.706
- It can't be turned off.
- OK, I don't like it.

45:28.737 --> 45:31.928
You're scaring me...
and you're scaring everyone around you.

45:32.710 --> 45:35.848
I think... I think my vagoogle
scared Jack last night.

45:35.879 --> 45:37.913
- My God!
- But in a good way.

45:38.695 --> 45:40.874
Like when you intentionally
go through a haunted house.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.782
Eww!

45:42.814 --> 45:43.898
Not saying...

45:44.826 --> 45:45.942
You know what I mean.

45:46.724 --> 45:48.872
Please, I just don't wanna
talk about your vagoogle.

45:55.932 --> 46:00.759
All right.
I've got a little pop quiz for you here.

46:00.791 --> 46:03.950
But don't worry, I promise to grade it
pharaoh and squaraoh.

46:08.809 --> 46:13.939
Hey, I've got to tell you,
your work so far is impeccable.

46:13.971 --> 46:15.973
This department is lucky to have you back.

46:16.755 --> 46:20.821
My gosh. Wayne, thank you so much.
You know, it's still my passion.

46:20.853 --> 46:23.793
I guess once a dighead,
always a dighead?

46:23.824 --> 46:26.775
- Yes, you certainly are.
- Guess that makes me a dighead, too.

46:26.806 --> 46:29.768
OK, my advice to you
is to crack a book, all right?

46:29.799 --> 46:32.917
You are failing this class
in spectacular fashion.

46:35.869 --> 46:37.964
And I would love to see you
on a dig one day.

46:37.996 --> 46:41.770
That makes two of us
wanting to see me on a dig.

46:41.802 --> 46:43.960
That's...
Thank you. It's a lovely sediment.

46:45.962 --> 46:48.829
No. I did not. I did it, though.

46:50.769 --> 46:52.865
You're gonna make me become
Stone-unhinged.

46:56.858 --> 46:58.881
No, you get out!

46:58.912 --> 47:01.957
Anyway, I can't wait to see
your mid-term presentation.

47:01.988 --> 47:03.938
I'm pretty excited for you to read it.

47:03.969 --> 47:06.806
No, no. It's an oral presentation.

47:06.837 --> 47:08.808
It's a... What is it?

47:08.839 --> 47:11.999
Instead of with your hands, you present
your work with your mouth and tongue.

47:13.824 --> 47:15.857
OK. You're gonna be great.

47:15.889 --> 47:17.828
Just keep up the good work. OK.

47:21.863 --> 47:22.927
What's the matter?

47:22.958 --> 47:26.931
I'm just not fond of speaking in public.

47:27.828 --> 47:32.854
OK, let's get started on those quizzes.
You have 15 minutes, so do not dally.

47:39.881 --> 47:40.966
Dee Dee.

47:40.997 --> 47:43.917
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey! I um...

47:43.948 --> 47:48.828
I saw Maddie and she said that
you were gonna be in here studying.

47:48.860 --> 47:50.038
So, I got you a coffee.

47:50.070 --> 47:52.906
Thank you, Jack. That's so nice of you.

47:52.937 --> 47:54.897
I couldn't find any Chardonnay, so...

47:54.929 --> 47:57.035
It's probably for the best.

47:58.046 --> 48:01.070
Hey, have you...
been getting my texts?

48:02.009 --> 48:03.875
Um...

48:03.906 --> 48:05.043
You know what? I usually...

48:05.074 --> 48:08.025
I turn off my little chimey alert.

48:08.056 --> 48:11.956
Yeah. You gotta be quiet in the library,
right?

48:13.989 --> 48:15.877
Wow, that's...

48:15.991 --> 48:17.941
That's a lot of texts, Jack.

48:17.973 --> 48:20.934
- Now that I'm here...
- Yeah.

48:20.965 --> 48:22.905
Yeah, I can just tell you.

48:23.959 --> 48:25.898
I um...

48:25.929 --> 48:28.025
I kind of can't stop thinking about you.

48:29.933 --> 48:31.059
Jack, that is so sweet.

48:31.967 --> 48:34.031
You wanna know
what I can't stop thinking about?

48:34.062 --> 48:37.034
Us. Me and you, we leave this school.

48:37.065 --> 48:40.048
We can go backpacking across Europe.

48:40.079 --> 48:42.008
Me and you - Eat Pray Love style.

48:42.039 --> 48:46.116
I-I can...
I can bartend, we'll make it work...

48:46.898 --> 48:47.951
Jack.

48:48.900 --> 48:51.893
Years ago,
somebody asking me to do that with them

48:51.924 --> 48:54.010
would have been an absolute dream.

48:54.041 --> 48:57.128
But I can't travel with a backpack
any more.

48:58.129 --> 49:00.913
I need luggage with wheels.

49:00.945 --> 49:02.008
I mean, I...

49:02.039 --> 49:04.125
Even my carry-on has wheels, Jack.

49:05.094 --> 49:08.045
My hips can't really sustain a backpack.

49:08.077 --> 49:11.090
They're never the same after a childbirth,
you know, but...

49:11.945 --> 49:14.938
But it's such a wonderful offer

49:14.969 --> 49:16.981
and you're such a terrific guy but...

49:18.035 --> 49:20.068
I think what we had the other night

49:20.099 --> 49:24.134
was really kind of
a one-time special thing.

49:37.075 --> 49:39.995
That was amazing!
DEANNA: That was so nice.

49:41.027 --> 49:42.164
My God!

49:44.009 --> 49:45.167
My God!

49:45.949 --> 49:47.075
- My God!
- My God.

49:47.106 --> 49:49.108
You are my sexual Dumbledore.

49:49.139 --> 49:51.141
- I mean...
- What does that mean?

49:51.173 --> 49:54.030
Dumbledore, he's from Harry Potter.

49:54.061 --> 49:57.075
You know, Harry Potter's, like, mentor...

49:57.106 --> 49:59.191
he's got the beard, and he's got the hat.

49:59.973 --> 50:02.997
- Dumbledore.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

50:05.103 --> 50:07.064
Um...this is just...

50:07.095 --> 50:09.088
This will ride you through life.

50:09.119 --> 50:13.154
I don't think ever there's a woman
that's gonna want you to say

50:13.185 --> 50:15.146
that during a sexual encounter

50:15.177 --> 50:19.984
you're thinking of her
as an old, grey, grizzled wizard.

50:20.015 --> 50:21.141
Aww!

50:21.172 --> 50:23.060
- Yeah.
- Aww! Um...

50:23.091 --> 50:26.125
- OK. I'm sorry.
- So good up until...

50:26.157 --> 50:29.180
until you called me
an old, grey, male wizard.

50:29.212 --> 50:31.047
Wizard talk's gone.

50:31.078 --> 50:33.007
- Well...
- All right.

50:33.237 --> 50:35.207
OK, well, um...

50:36.177 --> 50:38.242
- I'd better...
- See you later?

50:39.024 --> 50:41.235
No, no, no.
That was the last...

50:42.016 --> 50:44.029
That was the last time...

50:44.060 --> 50:46.115
- You said that earlier.
- I know.

50:46.146 --> 50:51.151
I know, but your wrist got involved
and I got distracted, so...

50:52.163 --> 50:54.029
Last time. OK.

50:55.103 --> 50:57.178
OK, that's it. And we're done.

50:57.209 --> 50:59.211
It's a clean... clean break.

51:00.233 --> 51:02.246
You know what? Just a finale.

51:06.177 --> 51:08.085
OK. I'll text you.

51:10.212 --> 51:12.204
OK, I'll miss that. I'll miss that.

51:12.235 --> 51:15.155
OK. You go that way. I'll go this way.

51:16.145 --> 51:17.262
Damn it, man.

51:20.181 --> 51:22.057
My God!

51:23.132 --> 51:24.175
Come on, come on, come on.

51:24.206 --> 51:25.270
Hello?

51:26.052 --> 51:27.147
<i>What are you doing?</i>

51:27.178 --> 51:30.139
I think my forks have oxidised.

51:30.171 --> 51:32.131
I'm just... I'm trying to get it off.

51:32.162 --> 51:34.237
<i>- What are you doing?</i>
- I just had sex in the library.

51:34.268 --> 51:37.105
- What?
<i>- I just had sex in the library.</i>

51:37.136 --> 51:38.220
You had what?

51:39.075 --> 51:41.067
I... I just had sex in the library.

51:41.098 --> 51:44.091
You had sex in a library?

51:44.122 --> 51:45.258
<i>- Frank!</i>
- No, don't tell Frank.

51:45.290 --> 51:48.282
- Deanna just had sex in a public place.
- What? Where?

51:48.314 --> 51:51.223
- In the stacks!
- In her slacks?

51:51.254 --> 51:53.320
No. Shut up, Frank.

51:54.101 --> 51:55.311
Hang on for one second.

51:59.138 --> 52:01.275
You know what? I have to go.
I'll call you later.

52:03.309 --> 52:05.248
Can you believe this, Frank?

52:05.279 --> 52:07.188
Good for Deanna.

52:08.147 --> 52:09.273
Frank?

52:13.215 --> 52:15.321
Why don't we ever have sex in public?

52:16.218 --> 52:18.324
Because, honey,
last time you blew your knee out

52:19.106 --> 52:21.275
and I had to carry you out of Six Flags.

52:25.133 --> 52:27.166
But I do like those fuzzy socks.

52:27.197 --> 52:29.210
Frank.

52:31.201 --> 52:33.308
Thanks for coming, Mom.
Debbie's really freaking out.

52:33.339 --> 52:36.280
It sounded serious.
I'm gonna make my lasagne.

52:38.344 --> 52:39.450
OK...

52:40.367 --> 52:42.234
Hey, Debbie.

52:42.265 --> 52:45.247
Do you think you're ready to maybe
start talking about it now?

52:45.278 --> 52:47.343
She went to a job fair
and now she's all freaked out.

52:48.240 --> 52:51.243
I thought fairs were supposed to be fun.
This one wasn't fun at all.

52:51.274 --> 52:53.464
I don't even know
what I really wanna do with my life.

52:54.246 --> 52:56.446
- Why did I study kinesiology?
- That's...

52:57.228 --> 52:59.460
I mean, that's basically
like physical therapy, right?

53:00.241 --> 53:01.400
Kind of, but not as useful.

53:01.431 --> 53:03.475
It's the theoretical study
of human movement.

53:04.392 --> 53:06.321
OK. Wow.

53:06.353 --> 53:10.304
I can see that does feel slightly limited

53:10.336 --> 53:13.370
in employment opportunities.

53:14.267 --> 53:18.354
I took out $45,000 in student loans
and what am I ready for? Nothing.

53:18.385 --> 53:22.275
OK, come on. You can't make
such a big deal out of everything.

53:22.306 --> 53:24.391
Ladies, you gotta have a little faith
in yourselves.

53:24.423 --> 53:29.376
I spent 20 years just giving it all away.
I worried about what other people thought.

53:29.407 --> 53:32.358
I worried about what they thought
I should be doing. Never what I thought.

53:32.389 --> 53:35.277
Look at me now.
I'm living in a dorm with a roommate

53:35.309 --> 53:37.279
that I'm pretty sure watches me
while I sleep.

53:37.311 --> 53:39.480
I got the clothes on my back.
I got nothing.

53:39.512 --> 53:42.348
The last 20 years of my life
have been a real shit show.

53:42.379 --> 53:43.453
Thank you.

53:44.350 --> 53:46.310
Not meaning you... I mean...

53:46.341 --> 53:48.354
You know... You know what I mean.
I just...

53:48.385 --> 53:49.469
Give me those fingers.

53:49.501 --> 53:53.296
Every single little thing about you
is a dream.

53:53.328 --> 53:54.454
I wouldn't change any of that.

53:54.485 --> 53:57.425
The rest, I would like to
rewind that clock

53:57.457 --> 54:01.492
and 20 years ago start speaking up
for myself, so that's my point.

54:01.523 --> 54:04.339
You gals are terrific.
You're not quitters.

54:04.370 --> 54:06.424
I'm afraid I'm never gonna be
in a real relationship.

54:06.455 --> 54:08.343
Amanda! Come on!

54:08.374 --> 54:10.480
- Come on!
- I'm so sorry.

54:10.511 --> 54:14.548
Honey, if you can't use what the good Lord
made you and make that work,

54:15.329 --> 54:17.446
then what the hell hope do any of us have?

54:17.478 --> 54:20.481
- None.
- You're all amazing. I mean, look at you.

54:20.512 --> 54:24.328
You're all lovely here
and you're smart and you're wonderful

54:24.360 --> 54:26.560
and you're weird, in the best, best way.

54:27.342 --> 54:28.509
I just... I mean, if you look...

54:28.541 --> 54:30.522
My God! Look at Carol's legs.

54:30.553 --> 54:32.378
Legs for days.

54:32.409 --> 54:33.483
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:33.514 --> 54:35.496
Just enjoy 'em, for God's sakes.

54:35.527 --> 54:39.333
Just... We all have to realise
everybody's great, right?

54:39.364 --> 54:40.563
And this is good. OK?

54:41.345 --> 54:43.452
And this is good, and this is good,
and these are good.

54:43.483 --> 54:46.392
- And this is... My God!
- Mom, do not touch Amanda's butt!

54:46.423 --> 54:47.561
You know what it makes me think of?

54:48.457 --> 54:50.501
It's like a three-day-old loaf of bread.

54:50.532 --> 54:53.463
It's firmer, but it's kept
its original shape.

54:53.494 --> 54:56.549
Now, I... I think I've just been
looser structurally.

54:56.580 --> 55:00.365
You know, I could explain to you
the differences in your bodies.

55:00.397 --> 55:01.564
But only as it pertains to movement.

55:01.596 --> 55:05.381
Look what's happening right now.
Look what's happening right...

55:05.412 --> 55:06.559
You're using your degree.

55:06.590 --> 55:09.426
- You're doing it!
- I am.

55:09.458 --> 55:12.534
You guys, there's a party tonight
at Deltas and it's '80s themed.

55:12.565 --> 55:15.495
So, ladies, time to crush a party.

55:15.526 --> 55:17.591
I brought my dress-up trunk.

55:18.373 --> 55:20.479
Girls Just Want To Have Fun

55:26.465 --> 55:29.395
<i>♪ I come home in the morning light</i>

55:29.427 --> 55:33.576
<i>♪ My mother says when you gonna</i>
<i>live your life right?</i>

55:34.411 --> 55:37.435
<i>♪ Mother dear...</i>
- I told you we should have done Dynasty.

55:37.466 --> 55:39.582
Why do they all look so good?

55:39.614 --> 55:42.440
- Welcome to the '80s!
- Thank you.

55:42.471 --> 55:44.431
Hey! Theta Gammas!

55:44.462 --> 55:47.590
Hi, there! Well,
I'm not officially a member.

55:47.622 --> 55:49.624
I'm a little too young to join a sorority.

55:51.615 --> 55:53.544
No!

55:54.420 --> 55:55.619
Don't drink that.

55:55.651 --> 55:58.644
This is a 2017 Italian Chardonnay.

55:59.425 --> 56:01.512
- Jack...
- Yeah, it's truly one of a kind.

56:01.543 --> 56:03.482
Very oaky, very buttery.

56:03.514 --> 56:05.599
Because it was a hot and dry fall
this year in Italy.

56:05.630 --> 56:08.612
So, the grapes are very, very succulent.

56:08.644 --> 56:12.544
Well, far be from me
to turn down a succulent grape.

56:12.575 --> 56:15.484
You're being really weird
with the grape descriptions.

56:15.515 --> 56:17.611
It's lovely. It really is.

56:17.642 --> 56:19.446
Hey, Grandma.

56:20.447 --> 56:23.534
Hey, Jack, could you help me
track down a drink?

56:24.618 --> 56:27.454
OK, Jennifer, there's a keg out back.

56:27.486 --> 56:29.477
There's also boxed wine.

56:29.633 --> 56:32.605
You know what? I think we're gonna go
take a little spin around,

56:32.636 --> 56:34.576
try to figure out who shot JR.

56:35.609 --> 56:36.683
Someone was shot?

56:37.464 --> 56:40.458
No. No! God, no, it's from Dallas.

56:40.489 --> 56:41.636
It's a television programme.

56:41.667 --> 56:44.462
OK, I'll explain it.

56:45.598 --> 56:49.498
Hey, if there's anything else
I can get for you...

56:49.529 --> 56:51.511
Seriously, anything. More wine...

56:51.542 --> 56:54.576
Anything, honestly,
just, just... just let me know.

56:54.607 --> 56:55.660
OK, thanks, Jack.

56:57.527 --> 56:59.633
I love what's left of your top.

57:00.561 --> 57:01.677
Ha!

57:03.668 --> 57:05.535
So, what's your deal, man?

57:05.566 --> 57:07.558
I don't know.

57:07.683 --> 57:10.603
She makes me so nervous. Can you tell?

57:11.551 --> 57:12.658

Hi! You need some friends
and some vitamin D.

Guys, why did I have to do this?

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.846
Just hold her up,
so we can get her head in there.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:11.883
- My God!
- Aw, kidnapping?

01:00:11.915 --> 01:00:13.844
- No! Leonor!
- Come on.

01:00:13.875 --> 01:00:14.918
No!

01:00:17.806 --> 01:00:18.859
Hello?

01:00:19.777 --> 01:00:21.800
Is there....

01:00:23.708 --> 01:00:26.700
<i>Deanna Miles,</i>
<i>welcome to your trial by fire.</i>

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:30.694
What is that device
that's making your voice so strange?

01:00:30.725 --> 01:00:31.830
<i>It's a voice modulator!</i>

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.759
<i>Everybody, take off your masks.</i>

01:00:35.918 --> 01:00:38.764
My face got so hot under there.

01:00:38.796 --> 01:00:41.747
God, Debbie,
what's wrong with your face?

01:00:41.778 --> 01:00:42.936
I'm allergic to latex.

01:00:43.717 --> 01:00:44.938
Then why would you put the mask on?

01:00:45.719 --> 01:00:47.889
I just wanted to be a team player.

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:53.718
Deanna Miles, are you ready to become
an honorary member of Theta Mu Gamma?

01:00:54.948 --> 01:00:57.868
Really? Is that what this is about?

01:00:57.899 --> 01:00:59.849
Wow, ladies! I mean, as long as it's...

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.809
Is that OK with Maddie?

01:01:01.841 --> 01:01:03.801
It was my idea, Mom.

01:01:05.772 --> 01:01:07.857
Maddie Miles, please untie your mother.

01:01:08.733 --> 01:01:10.797
Am I supposed to act scared
or anything or can I...

01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:11.861
- No.
- OK.

01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:12.935
- Just be yourself.
- OK.

01:01:12.966 --> 01:01:14.801
Thank you, honey.

01:01:15.907 --> 01:01:18.868
Linda, please bring forth the candle.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.745
Where's Linda?

01:01:21.872 --> 01:01:24.812
- Welcome.
- Thank you, Linda.

01:01:24.844 --> 01:01:28.921
Now you will be presented
with the sacred paddle.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:31.809
Welcome, Dee Rock.

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:33.967
Carol, my...your brushwork

01:01:33.999 --> 01:01:36.804
is absolutely lovely.

01:01:36.835 --> 01:01:38.910
They're actually just stickers, but...

01:01:38.941 --> 01:01:42.903
Maddie, please spank your mother
with the ceremonial paddle.

01:01:43.779 --> 01:01:45.990
No, I'm not... I'm not paddling my mother.

01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:47.856
Come on, Maddie.

01:01:47.888 --> 01:01:48.920
Maddie, team player!

01:01:48.951 --> 01:01:52.934
You know what? I have to ask.
Has everybody else been paddled?

01:01:52.965 --> 01:01:55.791
Because I don't wanna be
the stick in the mud.

01:01:55.823 --> 01:01:58.889
Should I crouch? I'm assuming
I should take a crouched position.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.005
I crouched.

01:02:00.787 --> 01:02:02.966
I want the full Greek experience
because I've always wondered...

01:02:07.836 --> 01:02:08.951
God, that hit bone!

01:02:08.982 --> 01:02:10.025
- Mom.
- Maddie!

01:02:10.807 --> 01:02:12.027
I'm sorry.

01:02:12.809 --> 01:02:13.883
Mom.

01:02:13.915 --> 01:02:15.041
Is someone still hitting me?

01:02:15.823 --> 01:02:18.805
- I'm not touching you!
- I feel it!

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:21.923
They're like phantom pains
except they're real!

01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:24.905
Get off of me!

01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:27.814
God.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.951
I thought I was gonna vomit.

01:02:30.953 --> 01:02:31.975
No.

01:02:32.006 --> 01:02:33.915
I'm sorry...

01:02:33.946 --> 01:02:36.855
if I may have raised my voice.

01:02:36.886 --> 01:02:39.024
- Are you OK, Dee Rock?
- It's like when you stub a toe.

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:41.902
You just... You skyrocket

01:02:41.933 --> 01:02:46.020
and then 30 seconds later,
you didn't lose the toe,

01:02:46.052 --> 01:02:48.846
which you swore 30 seconds earlier...

01:02:48.878 --> 01:02:49.983
"I'm gonna lose the toe."

01:02:50.014 --> 01:02:53.069
Right? We've all been at that bedpost.

01:02:53.851 --> 01:02:55.895
- Are you ready to continue?
- I'd love to.

01:02:55.926 --> 01:02:56.948
All right.

01:02:56.979 --> 01:03:01.015
By the power vested in me by
this great state and educational facility,

01:03:01.046 --> 01:03:04.967
I declare you a member of Theta Mu Gamma.

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:10.921
My gosh!

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:15.092
I just wanna say, I mean, pound sign,
hashtag gratitude.

01:03:15.874 --> 01:03:16.907
Right here.

01:03:16.938 --> 01:03:19.002
<i>And there's cake upstairs!</i>

01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:22.068
Cake!

01:03:24.112 --> 01:03:25.978
She's allergic. She...

01:03:26.009 --> 01:03:27.104
Honey, you're allergic.

01:03:27.886 --> 01:03:28.992
Not tonight!

01:03:34.038 --> 01:03:35.112
All right.

01:03:35.894 --> 01:03:37.886
Exciting day. Hello to you, class.

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:41.098
I am very much looking forward
to discovering the treasure

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:43.017
of your mid-term presentations.

01:03:44.133 --> 01:03:46.906
- You're not gonna laugh at that?
- It's funny.

01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:49.075
I'm just... I'm too nervous
about this presentation.

01:03:49.106 --> 01:03:50.973
- I can't.
- OK, tell you what.

01:03:51.004 --> 01:03:53.997
Why don't we start off with...
No offence to the rest of you!

01:03:54.028 --> 01:03:55.947
..my favourite student?

01:03:55.978 --> 01:03:57.041
God. I gotta get some air.

01:03:57.073 --> 01:04:00.086
Don't worry about it.
It's me. I'm clearly his favourite.

01:04:00.117 --> 01:04:01.150
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:04:01.932 --> 01:04:04.997
Deanna Miles,
would you get us started, please?

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:08.084
God!

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.045
I'm um...

01:04:13.985 --> 01:04:15.133
- You wanna...
- No.

01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:20.159
- I know you're gonna knock our socks off.
- Thank you.

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.100
Deanna Miles is gonna start us off,
everybody. Lights.

01:04:25.988 --> 01:04:27.948
I didn't expect that.

01:04:29.043 --> 01:04:30.148
Hello.

01:04:32.057 --> 01:04:33.141
God.

01:04:33.172 --> 01:04:35.018
Sorry.

01:04:42.171 --> 01:04:44.986
I didn't... Is it a crank?

01:04:45.017 --> 01:04:46.091
It's a crank.

01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:48.125
I'm sorry, I just need to...

01:04:50.012 --> 01:04:51.128
We are gonna...

01:04:52.182 --> 01:04:55.038
I'm here to... God!

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.113
I'm sorry.

01:04:57.103 --> 01:04:58.156
I'm so sorry.

01:04:58.188 --> 01:05:03.193
Is it part of the core curriculum
that I must use the podium?

01:05:03.975 --> 01:05:05.111
Of course not. No, not at all.

01:05:05.143 --> 01:05:10.127
OK. I'm going to opt
to not use that.

01:05:14.058 --> 01:05:15.997
She's totally pitting out.

01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:17.186
She's gonna be fine.

01:05:21.138 --> 01:05:22.212
I'm here...

01:05:22.994 --> 01:05:24.130
Too loud, too loud.

01:05:24.162 --> 01:05:26.153
I'm here to discuss...

01:05:26.184 --> 01:05:31.012
not an exciting find
but rather an exciting truth.

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.101
The tomb of Attila the Hun,

01:05:35.226 --> 01:05:40.137
thought to be in Budapest, Hungary,
in 2014,

01:05:40.168 --> 01:05:42.066
but was in fact a hoax.

01:05:42.097 --> 01:05:43.255
But how do we know?

01:05:45.236 --> 01:05:47.092
How do we know?

01:05:47.123 --> 01:05:49.031
Ms Miles, are you OK?

01:05:49.063 --> 01:05:51.158
Yes. I'm fine. Just...

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:55.256
You know what? If I could just maybe
get into a couple of those tissues...

01:05:56.038 --> 01:05:57.227
Of course.

01:06:01.127 --> 01:06:02.180
- I'm sorry.
- No.

01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:08.145
You may wanna check with your HVAC guy
because something's going on in here.

01:06:11.065 --> 01:06:12.139
- Thank you.
- You've got...

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.237
Thank you. That's better.

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.115
Tissue.

01:06:21.169 --> 01:06:23.077
My God.

01:06:26.059 --> 01:06:27.185
My God.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.098
Historically...

01:06:34.129 --> 01:06:36.299
Historically, the Huns have...

01:06:39.176 --> 01:06:44.255
Could I just have a small...
small sip of water from someone?

01:06:45.246 --> 01:06:47.112
Can I... Do you mind if I just...

01:06:47.143 --> 01:06:49.229
Thank you so much. Thank you.

01:06:51.293 --> 01:06:53.212
Don't be a dick now.

01:07:01.262 --> 01:07:04.265
That is surprisingly challenging my body.

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.340
- Wayne!
- Deanna.

01:07:08.237 --> 01:07:10.156
Girl.

01:07:12.116 --> 01:07:14.212
I think it's OK now.

01:07:16.236 --> 01:07:18.143
So sorry for that.

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:23.337
Rümschtein discovered a tomb,

01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:28.238
- allegedly that had many human...
- skeletons,

01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:32.252
and many various
different kinds of horse skeletons,

01:07:33.253 --> 01:07:35.182
ie, carcasses,

01:07:36.277 --> 01:07:39.321
to enable them to come into
the next dimension.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:42.283
Are there any questions...?

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.349
- Deanna?
- No. OK...

01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:49.144
Ms Miles! Ms Miles!

01:07:49.175 --> 01:07:50.218
Dee Rock!

01:07:51.282 --> 01:07:53.200
How did I do?

01:07:53.232 --> 01:07:55.338
Girl, you sweat through your pants.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:58.394
No. I love these pants.

01:08:04.306 --> 01:08:07.319
It was the first time I've taken a look
at his entire portfolio.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:14.170
And I looked at him and I said,
"Tom, your 401 is 401 not OK."

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:16.307
Interesting.

01:08:16.339 --> 01:08:18.247
Sounds like a really exciting business.

01:08:18.278 --> 01:08:20.197
I'm glad to see you.

01:08:20.228 --> 01:08:22.209
- Yeah, me, too.
- I'm glad you called me.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.252
You're being quiet tonight. What is it?

01:08:24.283 --> 01:08:27.340
No, I'm enjoying the wine,
and the neat banter.

01:08:27.371 --> 01:08:30.332
My God.
We're too old and boring for you now.

01:08:30.363 --> 01:08:33.252
- Don't say that. That's not true.
- I knew it. Don't dump me.

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.430
- I'm not gonna dump you.
- I mean it.

01:08:35.212 --> 01:08:38.225
I will leave Frank. In a heartbeat.

01:08:38.256 --> 01:08:41.260
I don't give two rats' asses
about Amy and Bill.

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:44.243
- Excuse me?
- Your jokes make me wanna kill myself.

01:08:44.274 --> 01:08:45.358
They're not very good.

01:08:45.389 --> 01:08:46.443
No, they're the worst.

01:08:47.225 --> 01:08:48.361
That's... That's fair.

01:08:49.216 --> 01:08:52.240
- My God.
- My God.

01:08:52.270 --> 01:08:54.273
- Those pricks are here.
- Who?

01:08:54.305 --> 01:08:56.255
- They can't see me.
- Where are you going?

01:08:56.286 --> 01:08:59.247
- What are you doing?
- Maybe they're going the other...

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.334
I can't believe...
I did not know they were gonna be here.

01:09:03.282 --> 01:09:05.390
- Well...
- Here it is. Found my contact.

01:09:05.421 --> 01:09:07.402
- Hey, gang. What's the good word?
- Hi!

01:09:10.238 --> 01:09:12.282
What a surprise!
I didn't know you were here.

01:09:12.313 --> 01:09:13.460
- You guys know Marcie, right?
- Yeah.

01:09:14.242 --> 01:09:16.243
- I don't think I introduced you.
- Hi. Hello.

01:09:16.276 --> 01:09:17.443
Pleasure. It's great.

01:09:17.475 --> 01:09:22.240
What is... What is on your lobe, Dan?

01:09:22.407 --> 01:09:24.470
It's an earring.
It works for Harrison Ford.

01:09:25.252 --> 01:09:26.274
Sure does.

01:09:26.305 --> 01:09:28.475
Harrison Ford blew up the Death Star
and freed a galaxy.

01:09:29.256 --> 01:09:30.300
What have you done, Dan?

01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:33.448
Six-minute abs. He completed
the 30-day challenge of six-minute abs.

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:35.399
My goal is to have a washboard.

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.486
Now, Deanna, what are you up to?
You still pretending to go to college?

01:09:39.267 --> 01:09:41.406
Because you know,
Dan can't foot that bill forever.

01:09:41.437 --> 01:09:45.274
What was the word we learned in Italy
for "pathetic"?

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:48.267
- I don't remember any more.
- I do. It was Deanna.

01:09:48.298 --> 01:09:50.488
Pathetico in Italian. Pathetic, pathetico.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:57.297
Bill, you look like Orson Welles
had a stroke and stayed that way.

01:09:57.328 --> 01:09:59.330
Not the first time I've heard it.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.458
God, I hate him so much.
I hate him so much.

01:10:02.489 --> 01:10:04.387
He's hateable.

01:10:04.418 --> 01:10:07.317
Deanna, I wanted to speak to you
privately for a second.

01:10:07.348 --> 01:10:12.291
No. I don't have any time for you and I
will never have any time for you again.

01:10:12.322 --> 01:10:16.379
Fine. I was going to say,
Marcie and I have some big news.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.381
We're getting married next week.

01:10:18.413 --> 01:10:20.404
Small ceremony but super classy.

01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:21.468
Mazel tov!

01:10:21.499 --> 01:10:23.490
Shut up, Bill!

01:10:23.522 --> 01:10:25.440
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:29.371
They said they were getting married.
We should... Mazel tov!

01:10:29.403 --> 01:10:31.457
Read the room, Bill.

01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:33.375
Thank you. That was very kind.

01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:34.554
I'm not Jewish, but thank you.

01:10:35.336 --> 01:10:36.441
This is a bona fide shit show.

01:10:36.472 --> 01:10:38.391
Jeez.

01:10:38.422 --> 01:10:40.403
I was hoping for a "congratulations".

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:42.364
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:42.395 --> 01:10:45.325
- Can I get you any starters, appetisers?
- Jack!

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:47.421
- What...?
- Deanna.

01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:51.436
Wow, you look...stunning.

01:10:51.467 --> 01:10:53.438
I don't know.

01:10:53.469 --> 01:10:56.514
- Um...this is my mom.
- What?

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:58.558
Mom, this is who I was telling you about.
The girl.

01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.362
- No.
- What?

01:11:00.393 --> 01:11:02.499
- No!
- What am I hearing?

01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:03.563
What's happening?

01:11:04.345 --> 01:11:08.453
Jack, you told me you were seeing
a college girl named Dee Dee.

01:11:08.484 --> 01:11:12.415
Yeah, she came to the frat house
and we met at a party.

01:11:13.375 --> 01:11:15.491
That's not what you meant.

01:11:15.523 --> 01:11:16.576
Gosh!

01:11:17.358 --> 01:11:19.495
She had sex with your son!

01:11:19.527 --> 01:11:22.363
She had sex with your son
and she called me right after.

01:11:22.394 --> 01:11:23.594
Because we are friends!

01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:26.441
My goodness!

01:11:26.472 --> 01:11:30.601
Everybody, she slept with her son
in a library!

01:11:33.417 --> 01:11:35.533
This is the greatest thing
I've ever been a part of.

01:11:35.564 --> 01:11:36.576
- I get it.
- Cheers.

01:11:36.607 --> 01:11:39.496
It's just a cruel joke.
It's cruel, and you're right.

01:11:39.527 --> 01:11:42.540
You know what? I might deserve it.
I've been rough on you, but come on,

01:11:42.571 --> 01:11:46.534
seriously, did you have intercourse
with my son?

01:11:47.524 --> 01:11:49.422
Did you?

01:11:51.601 --> 01:11:57.399
In terms of your question of like,
did anything happen between us?

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:59.432
Have we slept together?

01:11:59.463 --> 01:12:01.623
Yeah. Yeah, we have.

01:12:02.404 --> 01:12:04.532
And I rocked...his world.

01:12:04.563 --> 01:12:06.482
- My God!
- Come on.

01:12:06.513 --> 01:12:09.422
Well, best night of my life.

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.435
I'll drink to that.

01:12:12.592 --> 01:12:14.500
All right. Bye, Jack.

01:12:15.512 --> 01:12:20.444
Whoa! That's my girl! That's my lady!

01:12:21.518 --> 01:12:22.665
Nice to finally meet you, Jack.

01:12:23.447 --> 01:12:25.428
I love you!

01:12:25.459 --> 01:12:28.618
I love you! You're my hero! Whoa!

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:31.517
I need... I'm gonna check on Dee Dee.

01:12:36.376 --> 01:12:37.535
- Dee Rock!
- Dee!

01:12:38.316 --> 01:12:39.495
Dee, where are you? There she is!

01:12:39.526 --> 01:12:41.518
- Hi! How are you?
- I heard you had sex in here!

01:12:41.549 --> 01:12:44.385
- So good to see you.
- My God, you guys. Ssh.

01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:47.399
- What are you doing here?
- We're here to get you out of here.

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:48.525
No. Why?

01:12:48.556 --> 01:12:51.392
Your ding-dong ex-husband's
getting married tonight.

01:12:51.424 --> 01:12:53.530
You were here for our girl
when she was freaking out.

01:12:53.561 --> 01:12:55.438
You've been there for all of us.

01:12:55.469 --> 01:12:57.367
Let us be there for you.

01:12:57.398 --> 01:13:00.454
My friend Lance who I was in a coma
with is having a gathering this evening.

01:13:00.485 --> 01:13:02.518
His place is kind of a dump,
but it'll be fun!

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:05.406
No. You know what?
I'm pretty much partied out.

01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:07.388
I just wanna stay in for the night

01:13:07.419 --> 01:13:08.482
- and hit the books.
- Please!

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:10.589
I'm sorry, Dee. I'm sorry.
I'm not taking this.

01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:12.571
You should not be alone tonight, so...

01:13:13.352 --> 01:13:15.354
- No!
- I'm afraid you don't have an option.

01:13:15.385 --> 01:13:17.586
Yeah, this is not like those
other parties. It's jazz night!

01:13:18.483 --> 01:13:20.391
OK. You know what?

01:13:20.422 --> 01:13:22.383
You're right. If I stay here any longer,

01:13:22.414 --> 01:13:24.468
I'm just gonna keep thinking
about that wedding.

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:27.429
Yeah, she's probably getting her dress on.

01:13:27.461 --> 01:13:29.421
Hair and make-up, going over her vows.

01:13:29.452 --> 01:13:31.517
OK, you know what? Let's just go.

01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:33.540
Yeah!

01:13:33.571 --> 01:13:35.448
No! No!

01:13:37.377 --> 01:13:41.610
You know, Lance, I have to say, you know,
you have a lovely, lovely home here.

01:13:42.392 --> 01:13:43.529
Are you sure tonight is a party?

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.614
Sorry. Lance, what's going on?
Where is everybody?

01:13:46.396 --> 01:13:47.564
- You promised me a jazz party.
- I know.

01:13:47.595 --> 01:13:50.610
You got people doing role-playing games.
And Tuesday night is jazz.

01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:53.519
- Thursday night is role-playing.
- I know. It's my bad.

01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:56.449
I tried to combine them
and I'm regretting that choice now

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.472
because I feel like
I'm losing the jazz crowd

01:13:58.503 --> 01:14:00.463
and I've also lost the role-playing crowd.

01:14:00.495 --> 01:14:02.445
Taking a ding on both sides.

01:14:02.476 --> 01:14:03.633
Yeah, it's like a double loss, really.

01:14:04.415 --> 01:14:06.490
You know what?
I'm having a wonderful time

01:14:06.522 --> 01:14:11.631
and I have to say, I cannot
stay out of this unbelievable choc...

01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:14.519
You are quite a gifted chocolatier.
I mean...

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.491
- They're really good.
- I don't usually like chocolate.

01:14:17.522 --> 01:14:20.525
I just started eating because
I was nervous but it's really good.

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:22.506
It is a weed bark. So, maybe...

01:14:22.538 --> 01:14:24.603
I would probably hold off
from having any more.

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:27.428
- Just cos...
- What is it?

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:31.485
I have a medicinal marijuana card
for early-onset glaucoma.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:33.591
- No.
- Yeah.

01:14:33.622 --> 01:14:35.656
- No, it's not.
- No, it most certainly is.

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:39.566
Lance, damn it! Why'd you put out
chocolate weed bark? You gotta label that.

01:14:39.597 --> 01:14:41.464
I am so sorry. It is...

01:14:41.495 --> 01:14:44.540
I've had 14. I've eaten a lot of bark.

01:14:44.571 --> 01:14:46.542
- I've eaten a lot of bark too.
- So much bark.

01:14:46.573 --> 01:14:48.450
So much bark.

01:14:48.481 --> 01:14:50.608
I just wanted to hear some Miles Davis,
you know.

01:14:50.639 --> 01:14:52.485
I'm sorry.

01:14:52.683 --> 01:14:56.625
Is that it? Because I'm starting
to feel a little fungly.

01:14:56.656 --> 01:14:58.595
Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:01.641
Fungly. Fun-Fungle. Fungl-y.

01:15:01.672 --> 01:15:04.476
You have such pretty eyes.

01:15:06.521 --> 01:15:08.533
Thank you.

01:15:10.535 --> 01:15:12.527
My tongue is so big.

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:20.566
♪ The final countdown!

01:15:20.598 --> 01:15:22.683
That was recognisable.

01:15:22.714 --> 01:15:24.727
Really good jam. I'm just gonna...

01:15:25.509 --> 01:15:26.604
- Can I get in here?
- Please.

01:15:26.635 --> 01:15:27.688
It's so comfy.

01:15:27.719 --> 01:15:29.669
OK, wait. I...

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.629
was thinking about something...

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.601
and if I do marry Jack...

01:15:34.632 --> 01:15:36.582
No! Just listen. Wait, wait.

01:15:36.614 --> 01:15:39.638
That would make Marcie my stepmom...

01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:43.549
and that would make Dan my new stepdad.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:48.564
And then I would have to say things like,
"Nuh-Dan. You're not my real dad.

01:15:48.595 --> 01:15:49.700
You can't tell me what to do.

01:15:49.732 --> 01:15:51.702
Give me the car!"

01:15:53.611 --> 01:15:55.706
Or, wait a minute... Or...

01:15:55.738 --> 01:15:57.656
I could flip it.

01:15:58.584 --> 01:15:59.763
And I could make peace with Dan.

01:16:00.545 --> 01:16:03.714
What a great teaching lesson,
right, that would be for Maddie

01:16:03.746 --> 01:16:07.635
to see forgiveness
and truly being the better person.

01:16:07.666 --> 01:16:09.648
- That's better.
- You're so smart.

01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:11.629
You gotta go to that wedding.

01:16:12.683 --> 01:16:13.736
Are we doing it?

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:15.780
My God. We're doing it!

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:24.674
Dan, when I first saw you,
I thought the kerb appeal wasn't great,

01:16:25.685 --> 01:16:27.687
the layout was a bit dated

01:16:27.719 --> 01:16:30.690
and the kitchen a little small
for my liking.

01:16:30.722 --> 01:16:32.682
Dee Rock, good for you.

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.590
You're being the better person.

01:16:34.621 --> 01:16:35.737
Thank you. That's the whole plan.

01:16:35.768 --> 01:16:37.760
I'm gonna see Dan,
I'm gonna shake his hand,

01:16:37.791 --> 01:16:40.805
I'm gonna extend
an olive branch to him and...

01:16:41.587 --> 01:16:45.601
What? He... He's taking her name!

01:16:45.632 --> 01:16:46.675
Who does...

01:16:46.706 --> 01:16:48.782
Men don't do that.

01:16:48.814 --> 01:16:52.672
I tried to do that
and he told me it was silly.

01:16:54.788 --> 01:16:57.614
That is a very alarming picture.

01:16:57.645 --> 01:16:59.741
Hey! I mean, is...

01:16:59.772 --> 01:17:01.608
Is that a shot at me?

01:17:01.639 --> 01:17:02.713
- ...yeah.
- I think so.

01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:14.777
You know what?
Dan just lost his olive branch.

01:17:15.705 --> 01:17:17.770
Throw It Down

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:22.650

01:18:13.744 --> 01:18:15.798
Deanna, what the hell is wrong with you?

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.696
My God!

01:18:17.832 --> 01:18:18.885
My God!

01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:22.691
Hey, Dan.

01:18:23.879 --> 01:18:26.757
Marcie... You're...

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:28.822
a big Beetlejuice fan?

01:18:28.853 --> 01:18:30.699
Mom!

01:18:30.824 --> 01:18:33.764
Hey, honey. That's...

01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:38.843
I think we may have
just gotten slightly...

01:18:38.874 --> 01:18:42.878
You know, I think... I think
if we all kind of work together...

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:45.788
we can have this shipshape and...

01:18:45.819 --> 01:18:48.739
you won't even know,
or it will be better.

01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:50.897
- Mom, why did you do this?
- Um...

01:18:50.928 --> 01:18:54.849
You know, it's a great um...question.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.716
I mean, I actually came here...

01:18:57.748 --> 01:19:00.730
fully with the intention
of offering an olive branch.

01:19:00.761 --> 01:19:04.744
Then I don't know if it was the crazy
wedding propaganda in the hallway

01:19:04.775 --> 01:19:07.957
or, you know, was it
the bark high that I'm on?

01:19:08.738 --> 01:19:12.951
Shut up. You are, as of this moment,
completely financially cut off.

01:19:13.732 --> 01:19:16.788
- What?
- Not one more penny for you.

01:19:16.903 --> 01:19:18.863
- Dad.
- Ssh.

01:19:19.812 --> 01:19:20.928
Would it help if I just...

01:19:20.959 --> 01:19:22.847
You know, you...

01:19:22.878 --> 01:19:24.765
You did a good job.

01:19:24.796 --> 01:19:25.922
- It looks good.
- It did.

01:19:25.954 --> 01:19:27.966
- It did look good.
- It was pretty.

01:19:28.748 --> 01:19:30.907
- I think you all should leave.
- OK.

01:19:36.777 --> 01:19:37.976
The other way.

01:19:43.952 --> 01:19:45.880
Get out!

01:19:46.808 --> 01:19:47.914
Thank you.

01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:50.823
The cake was really good.

01:19:50.855 --> 01:19:52.867
You got a blender.

01:20:03.795 --> 01:20:06.996
Hey! Look! I got your favourite.

01:20:08.831 --> 01:20:10.833
You haven't been returning
any of my calls.

01:20:10.864 --> 01:20:13.023
Yeah, I've been pretty busy
destroying hotel banquet rooms

01:20:13.805 --> 01:20:15.973
- and crashing weddings.
- OK. I get you're upset.

01:20:16.005 --> 01:20:18.018
No, Mom. I don't think you do.

01:20:18.935 --> 01:20:22.012
Is this why you went back to college?
So you could act like some dumb frat guy?

01:20:22.793 --> 01:20:24.879
Cos I actually thought
you wanted to learn something.

01:20:24.911 --> 01:20:27.986
But you've just been getting stoned
and sleeping with guys half your age.

01:20:28.018 --> 01:20:30.989
OK, Jack is not half my...age.

01:20:31.021 --> 01:20:34.003
My God, I think
he's less than half my age.

01:20:34.034 --> 01:20:37.048
OK, I hear you and you're right.

01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:39.853
Which is why I'm leaving school.

01:20:39.884 --> 01:20:41.813
What?

01:20:41.886 --> 01:20:43.940
I'm gonna drop out of school, honey.

01:20:44.868 --> 01:20:47.913
You know, it wasn't that easy for me
getting used to you being here.

01:20:47.944 --> 01:20:50.050
And now I actually did
and you're just giving up?

01:20:50.832 --> 01:20:52.886
You said the one thing
you regret most in your life

01:20:52.918 --> 01:20:55.995
is not finishing school
and now you're gonna do it again?

01:20:56.026 --> 01:20:57.945
You know what I regret?

01:20:57.976 --> 01:21:00.968
I regret that when you look back
on your senior year of college,

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.879
all you're gonna think about
is your mom's crazy mid-life crisis.

01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:05.994
That's what I regret.

01:21:06.025 --> 01:21:10.009
The worst part is I don't think I was
being a very good mom to you lately.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:13.001
And I'm so... I'm so sorry about that.

01:21:13.032 --> 01:21:14.086
No, it's OK.

01:21:14.868 --> 01:21:16.088
It's not OK, actually.

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:19.862
Not one bit. Not with me,
shouldn't be with you.

01:21:20.019 --> 01:21:22.041
And I'm... I'm gonna do better.

01:21:22.073 --> 01:21:24.096
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

01:21:25.024 --> 01:21:26.880
You're so great.

01:21:26.911 --> 01:21:28.903
- What are we gonna do?
- Well...

01:21:29.048 --> 01:21:30.925
You can start by drinking that.

01:21:30.957 --> 01:21:34.065
Let's go round up the girls and...
tell them all about it.

01:21:35.973 --> 01:21:38.100
I don't get it.
Why are you leaving school?

01:21:38.882 --> 01:21:42.918
Well, I'm in a bit of a tricky position,
financially.

01:21:42.949 --> 01:21:47.109
So, for right now
I can't cover my tuition and it's over.

01:21:47.891 --> 01:21:48.986
It's never over!

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:51.009
Was it over when I fell into a coma?

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.011
Well, for eight years, it was.

01:21:53.042 --> 01:21:54.961
That's an awesome point, Amanda.

01:21:54.992 --> 01:21:56.963
But now I'm back and I'm kicking ass.

01:21:56.994 --> 01:21:58.099
Just like Dee Rock here.

01:21:58.131 --> 01:22:01.916
She's gonna kick ass and graduate
and get a job

01:22:01.947 --> 01:22:03.991
and become the next Indiana Jones.

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.119
- Come here.
- Please don't go.

01:22:07.943 --> 01:22:10.133
You guys, we can't let this happen
to my mom a second time.

01:22:10.914 --> 01:22:12.959
She deserves to graduate.
We gotta help her.

01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:16.921
OK, in order to finish,
Dee Rock needs in the neighbourhood of...

01:22:16.953 --> 01:22:18.141
No, it's almost $12,000.

01:22:18.923 --> 01:22:20.998
- My God!
- I don't have that kind of money.

01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:25.002
You know what? This isn't your problem
to solve, ladies. You can let this go!

01:22:25.034 --> 01:22:28.016
- Can I say something?
OTHERS: Yes, Debbie, just say it.

01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:29.079
Say it.

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:32.124
OK, we throw a party to raise money
to keep Glenn in school.

01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:35.023
Deb, we can't raise that much money
from a party.

01:22:35.054 --> 01:22:37.014
We don't throw just any party.

01:22:37.046 --> 01:22:40.038
We throw the best party
this school has ever seen.

01:22:40.069 --> 01:22:42.166
If we charge $40 a head...

01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:45.044
- 1,000 students...
- OK.

01:22:45.075 --> 01:22:49.152
..that is $4,000.

01:22:50.018 --> 01:22:53.094
- No, it's not.
- No. That's $40,000.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:55.044
What? Done!

01:22:55.075 --> 01:22:59.997
A bunch of kids are not gonna pay $40
to keep some divorcée in college.

01:23:00.028 --> 01:23:01.196
No, but they might pay 20.

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:03.177
Which is $200,000.

01:23:03.959 --> 01:23:06.034
No, $20,000.

01:23:06.065 --> 01:23:07.129
- Helen, come on.
- No, honey.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.111
But that's way more money than we need
to keep Mom in school.

01:23:10.142 --> 01:23:11.977
What do you say, Mom?

01:23:12.009 --> 01:23:13.155
- Come on, Glenn.
- Please.

01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:18.056
I say you ladies are pretty remarkable.

01:23:18.088 --> 01:23:19.204
I mean, to be this age

01:23:19.985 --> 01:23:22.999
and to have your whole world
turned upside down

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:25.200
and to come out with friends like you
on the other side

01:23:25.982 --> 01:23:28.130
is quite a thing, really.

01:23:28.161 --> 01:23:30.163
And I'm proud to be your sister.

01:23:30.194 --> 01:23:33.156
And I'm so proud to be your mom
and I'm proud of you.

01:23:33.187 --> 01:23:35.116
I'm proud of you.

01:23:36.107 --> 01:23:40.204
And I'm so worried about the math skills
in this room.

01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:42.206
I don't mean to single you out

01:23:42.238 --> 01:23:46.117
but, Helen, I'm staring
right down the barrel at you.

01:23:47.211 --> 01:23:52.175
And I'm starting to think that maybe
this party plan just might work!

01:23:53.092 --> 01:23:54.145
Come on, Mom.

01:23:54.178 --> 01:23:56.022
No! I don't know!

01:23:56.054 --> 01:23:57.212
All right, I'm down to clown!

01:24:00.163 --> 01:24:03.166
This is going to be epic!

01:24:08.181 --> 01:24:10.256
OK. No one wants to show up first
to a party.

01:24:11.038 --> 01:24:13.207
I'm sure lots of people are gonna come.

01:24:13.238 --> 01:24:16.189
Guess everyone's
at the Christina Aguilera concert.

01:24:16.220 --> 01:24:19.057
- What? That's tonight?
- Yeah.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.069
My God. We don't stand a chance.

01:24:21.184 --> 01:24:23.092
All right, ladies,

01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:25.073
we gotta do something drastic.

01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:28.107
Because this is not working.

01:24:28.265 --> 01:24:31.205
You know,
I don't wanna be a negative Nelly

01:24:31.236 --> 01:24:33.259
but that is a tough pic, guys.

01:24:33.291 --> 01:24:35.282
You look happy and scared.

01:24:36.064 --> 01:24:37.295
I do, don't I?

01:24:38.077 --> 01:24:39.192
- All right.
- I like it.

01:24:39.224 --> 01:24:41.080
Screw this. Give me your phone.

01:24:41.111 --> 01:24:42.279
Why? What do you want?

01:24:43.061 --> 01:24:45.271
I'm gonna tweet out a juicier carrot.

01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:50.297
- Maddie!
- You're crazy.

01:24:51.079 --> 01:24:52.226
What is it? What did you do?

01:24:52.257 --> 01:24:55.146
I just tweeted
to Helen's three million followers

01:24:55.177 --> 01:24:59.087
that Christina Aguilera is gonna come
to the party after her concert tonight.

01:24:59.119 --> 01:25:02.122
My God! My God! My God!

01:25:02.153 --> 01:25:03.311
I love Christina Aguilera!

01:25:04.092 --> 01:25:06.136
She's the only person
I ever had a poster of.

01:25:06.272 --> 01:25:08.254
She's not actually coming, Debbie.

01:25:08.285 --> 01:25:10.162
But nobody needs to know that.

01:25:10.193 --> 01:25:12.247
How do you have three million followers?

01:25:13.186 --> 01:25:15.209
Coma Girl. I'm a medical mystery.

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.243
Now, Maddie, I don't know.
There's a real...

01:25:18.274 --> 01:25:21.256
fibbing element to that
that I don't like.

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:25.177
Do you think it'll work?

01:25:26.147 --> 01:25:27.231
I believed it.

01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:35.291
I think it's definitely working.

01:25:35.322 --> 01:25:37.199
Hell yeah, it is.

01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:40.161
Hey, here you go. Have fun!

01:25:40.192 --> 01:25:43.132
Thanks for posting about Christina.
I couldn't get tickets.

01:25:43.164 --> 01:25:44.364
- Coma Girl rules.
- Thank you!

01:25:45.145 --> 01:25:46.157
All right.

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:48.326
- Thank you.
- It's amazing.

01:25:48.357 --> 01:25:50.234
I'm tired of doing this.

01:25:50.265 --> 01:25:51.329
No, Helen, we can't all...

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.237
Hey! When's Christina getting here?

01:25:53.268 --> 01:25:54.321
- Guys...
- Yeah.

01:25:54.353 --> 01:25:57.283
Christina's coming.
She's the voice of our generation.

01:25:57.314 --> 01:25:59.212
- True.
- We can wait for her.

01:25:59.243 --> 01:26:00.348
♪ ..confession

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.153
♪ I'm gonna teach you boys a lesson

01:26:03.362 --> 01:26:05.249
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:26:08.148 --> 01:26:09.295
- It's good!
- It's not bad!

01:26:09.326 --> 01:26:11.338
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:13.382
Do you wanna meet in the garage
in 20 minutes?

01:26:14.164 --> 01:26:16.208
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, you would.

01:26:16.324 --> 01:26:18.210
No, no, no!

01:26:19.169 --> 01:26:20.380
God, make better choices.

01:26:21.161 --> 01:26:23.299
Um...hey, come on back.

01:26:23.331 --> 01:26:25.364
That popped right out of my mouth

01:26:25.395 --> 01:26:28.409
when actually I meant to say
we're not gonna do that.

01:26:29.264 --> 01:26:31.339
The... That's... You don't like the wine?

01:26:33.184 --> 01:26:35.416
No, the wine is great and...

01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:38.252
and you're great and...

01:26:39.201 --> 01:26:42.225
I just think
when you meet the right person,

01:26:42.256 --> 01:26:43.371
which is not me,

01:26:44.258 --> 01:26:46.427
she's gonna be really, really lucky

01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:50.201
but I think that we're...

01:26:50.233 --> 01:26:53.225
Yeah, we should
just really be good friends.

01:26:53.256 --> 01:26:55.332
I don't think I can get on board
with this, Dee.

01:26:55.364 --> 01:26:57.428
Well, I think it's for the best.

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.399
- OK.
- OK?

01:26:59.430 --> 01:27:01.359
Yeah, if you say so.

01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:03.434
Hey, Mom, look who's here!

01:27:04.216 --> 01:27:06.343
- Hi!
- Hi, what are you doing here?

01:27:06.375 --> 01:27:09.388
Well, I started following Coma Girl
on Twitter

01:27:09.419 --> 01:27:11.338
and I came to see...

01:27:12.287 --> 01:27:13.434
Xtina!

01:27:14.216 --> 01:27:15.363
Yeah!

01:27:15.394 --> 01:27:18.376
Hi, Jack. I'm Christine.

01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:20.264
We met at the restaurant.

01:27:20.295 --> 01:27:24.226
- Yeah, hi. I remember you...both.
- My man.

01:27:25.447 --> 01:27:27.470
God, I just... I wanna
go back to college so bad.

01:27:28.251 --> 01:27:29.419
Just go back to Frank.
Go back to Frank.

01:27:29.451 --> 01:27:32.277
Hey, hey! We're here.

01:27:32.464 --> 01:27:35.353
My God! What are they doing here?

01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:37.355
I don't wanna be at a party
with my mom and dad.

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:39.429
Yeah, that must be so weird for you, Mom.

01:27:40.389 --> 01:27:43.350
- Mom.
- Sweetheart!

01:27:43.381 --> 01:27:45.342
Hi. Hey, Dad.

01:27:45.373 --> 01:27:47.302
We heard you were having a party.

01:27:47.333 --> 01:27:48.470
So I made a taco salad.

01:27:49.252 --> 01:27:51.410
Yeah, I told her
a bunch of kids don't want a taco salad.

01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:54.455
- I would love to have some taco salad.
- Please, yeah! I love taco salad.

01:27:54.486 --> 01:27:57.302
- See, I told you!
- OK. All right.

01:27:57.333 --> 01:27:58.344
Your parents?

01:27:58.376 --> 01:28:01.358
Yeah. This is my mom and dad,
Mike and Sandy.

01:28:01.389 --> 01:28:02.453
- Yeah.
- Hello.

01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:05.310
Wow! OK. Um...

01:28:05.341 --> 01:28:08.324
Wow! A lovely, lovely couple.

01:28:08.355 --> 01:28:10.357
It's... It's such a pleasure to meet you.

01:28:10.389 --> 01:28:14.351
You've raised...wow!
What an incredible woman!

01:28:14.445 --> 01:28:16.322
Sorry, I'm Jack Strong.

01:28:16.353 --> 01:28:19.366
We've been seeing each other
for a little bit now.

01:28:19.398 --> 01:28:22.390
Well, I guess we're kind of on a break.
Pretty recent.

01:28:22.421 --> 01:28:24.475
But I want you both to know

01:28:24.507 --> 01:28:28.521
that I'm gonna take the best care
of your daughter that I can.

01:28:29.303 --> 01:28:31.420
- She means the world to me.
- OK.

01:28:31.451 --> 01:28:34.392
I... I gotta... I have a gun, son.

01:28:34.423 --> 01:28:35.486
No.

01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:37.332
We're just gonna walk off.

01:28:37.363 --> 01:28:39.334
- Are you kidding me?
- All right. No.

01:28:39.365 --> 01:28:42.349
Taco salad train. Choo-choo!

01:28:46.384 --> 01:28:48.448
Hey, where's Christina Aguilera?

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.419
This is false advertising!

01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:52.327
Guys, she's coming, OK?

01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:53.464
She's gonna be here soon.

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.529
Hey...I saw your tweet.

01:28:56.561 --> 01:28:58.490
Where's Xtina?

01:28:58.521 --> 01:29:00.450
She's not gonna show up, is she?

01:29:00.481 --> 01:29:02.379
You guys suck!

01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:04.412
If Christina doesn't show soon...

01:29:06.373 --> 01:29:08.468
..I'm gonna put your ass in another coma.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.418
Count of three, bitch.

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:12.379
One, two...

01:29:20.544 --> 01:29:23.370
Look, honey, we love you.

01:29:23.401 --> 01:29:25.393
We want you to graduate.

01:29:25.424 --> 01:29:27.374
This is for you.

01:29:28.385 --> 01:29:29.563
What is...

01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:32.441
- No.
- Yep.

01:29:32.473 --> 01:29:34.433
I love you so much,
but I'm not gonna let you

01:29:34.464 --> 01:29:36.404
take apart your 401 for this.

01:29:36.435 --> 01:29:37.478
I got this.

01:29:37.509 --> 01:29:39.407
Honey, come on...

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.463
Hey! Hey!

01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:46.559
- Eat gluten!
- I ain't allowed to have gluten!

01:29:46.591 --> 01:29:48.384
My God!

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:49.510
Frank, do something!

01:29:49.543 --> 01:29:52.378
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know! Do something.

01:29:52.409 --> 01:29:53.432
Come on, girls!

01:29:53.463 --> 01:29:55.403
Ladies! Hey! Let's break it up!

01:29:58.395 --> 01:29:59.480
You!

01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:06.403
Her skull is so strong.

01:30:06.435 --> 01:30:08.478
Sweetheart, you were so brave.

01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:11.533
That's my brave man. Come on,
let's go make love in the bathroom.

01:30:11.565 --> 01:30:15.402
OK. I can't see, so...just lead me.

01:30:15.433 --> 01:30:16.497
There we go.

01:30:17.414 --> 01:30:19.521
No! Stop fighting, girls!

01:30:19.552 --> 01:30:21.543
- Say night-night.
- No! No!

01:30:21.575 --> 01:30:23.597
No!

01:30:27.424 --> 01:30:28.551
Boy!

01:30:28.583 --> 01:30:30.605
- My God, Mom!
- Dee Dee!

01:30:30.637 --> 01:30:33.421
- She got me in the biscuits!
- My God!

01:30:33.452 --> 01:30:34.609
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

01:30:34.641 --> 01:30:37.498
You punched Dee Rock?
I'm gonna squish you like a grape!

01:30:37.529 --> 01:30:41.439
Guys, stop it! Stop it! Stop it! God!

01:30:41.471 --> 01:30:44.442
Ladies, we have enough stuff
to worry about as women.

01:30:44.474 --> 01:30:47.477
- You shouldn't be fighting each other.
- I'm sorry, Dee Rock.

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:49.552
I'm sorry I punched you
in the mom boob.

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:51.574
- Tell each other sorry.
- I'm sorry, Dee Rock.

01:30:51.606 --> 01:30:52.680
Thank you.

01:30:53.587 --> 01:30:55.578
Would you care for a Kahlúa and cranberry?

01:30:56.465 --> 01:30:57.549
Ew. That...

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.667
I would do it. I would do it. Yeah.

01:31:00.542 --> 01:31:01.564
- OK.
- OK.

01:31:01.596 --> 01:31:02.691
I want one.

01:31:03.567 --> 01:31:05.453
Mom, are you OK?

01:31:05.485 --> 01:31:06.674
She popped me right in the bosom.

01:31:07.456 --> 01:31:09.458
I really got T-boned.

01:31:09.489 --> 01:31:10.678
- Mom.
- You know, what...

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.638
What am I doing here?

01:31:13.556 --> 01:31:16.548
I'm lying to these kids.
I'm taking their money. I...

01:31:17.508 --> 01:31:18.602
I got this.

01:31:18.634 --> 01:31:20.636
Hey, everybody, you know what?

01:31:20.667 --> 01:31:21.699
Party's over.

01:31:22.481 --> 01:31:24.598
Head on back to the door.
We're gonna give you a refund.

01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:26.610
Christina Aguilera is in no way...

01:31:26.642 --> 01:31:28.654
Can I see you for a second?

01:31:28.685 --> 01:31:30.594
God bless!

01:31:31.667 --> 01:31:33.723
Leonor or Lenore...

01:31:34.504 --> 01:31:35.662
you gotta stop doing that.

01:31:35.693 --> 01:31:37.695
Can I see you for a second?

01:31:37.727 --> 01:31:39.635
Now is not really a good time.

01:31:39.666 --> 01:31:40.730
Outside! Now!

01:31:41.512 --> 01:31:43.587
Don't make eye contact.

01:31:43.701 --> 01:31:46.715
Look at me. Look me in my eyes.

01:31:47.497 --> 01:31:48.685
- Look me in my eyes now.
- Debbie.

01:31:48.717 --> 01:31:50.510
I'm scared.

01:31:50.542 --> 01:31:52.575
Look. Look, look.

01:31:52.606 --> 01:31:53.670
Come outside.

01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:55.703
- Let's go!
- If I'm going, you're going.

01:31:56.506 --> 01:31:57.747
- I don't wanna go.
- We're stronger as a group.

01:31:59.062 --> 01:32:00.970
Leonor.

01:32:03.045 --> 01:32:05.923
Leonor, what is going on?

01:32:08.999 --> 01:32:10.928
Hey, guys. I'm Christina.

01:32:12.992 --> 01:32:14.035
- My God!
- My God!

01:32:14.066 --> 01:32:16.944
- I love you. I love you so much!
- I love you, too.

01:32:16.976 --> 01:32:18.091
How is this happening?

01:32:18.873 --> 01:32:22.064
I knew she wasn't playing at your party
cos Christina's my cousin.

01:32:23.034 --> 01:32:24.952
We're more like sisters.

01:32:24.984 --> 01:32:27.038
She always says that,
but we're just cousins.

01:32:27.069 --> 01:32:28.112
Isn't she so funny?

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:33.075
That's what I'm always saying to you.
I'm always saying you're so funny.

01:32:33.107 --> 01:32:36.100
I just can't kind of figure out
why you're doing this.

01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:38.978
Because you're a good lady.

01:32:39.009 --> 01:32:41.897
I mean, you're a sad, older lady

01:32:41.929 --> 01:32:44.973
but you're still a good lady
that needs help.

01:32:45.005 --> 01:32:46.120
Us ladies gotta stick together.

01:32:46.902 --> 01:32:49.061
She filled me in about,
you know, you being here.

01:32:49.092 --> 01:32:52.950
- I support your cause. I wanna do this.
- Thank you. God, you're cool!

01:32:52.981 --> 01:32:54.086
Where are we doing this thing?

01:32:54.118 --> 01:32:56.130
Backyard.
We just put up some twinkle lights.

01:32:56.912 --> 01:32:58.090
Love twinkle lights
but I've got my own lights.

01:32:58.122 --> 01:33:00.072
Boys, bring 'em out. Let's go!

01:33:00.103 --> 01:33:03.971
Donald, Craig, Jerry, let's go.

01:33:06.098 --> 01:33:11.041

I just... I wanted to thank you
for giving me a second chance.

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.265
It means a lot to me.

01:34:57.046 --> 01:35:00.101
Of course. It's only because
it's a requirement to pass the course.

01:35:00.133 --> 01:35:02.083
That and the fact
you're my favourite student.

01:35:02.114 --> 01:35:04.241
- Well...
- Break a leg.

01:35:04.273 --> 01:35:06.160

Thank you.

01:35:17.161 --> 01:35:18.245
Thank you.

01:35:23.073 --> 01:35:24.178
Hello.

01:35:30.121 --> 01:35:35.074
March 25th, 2014, historian Albert...

01:35:35.252 --> 01:35:42.072
Albrecht Rümschtein announced
that the burial tomb of Attila the Hun

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:44.282
had been discovered in Budapest, Hungary.

01:35:45.137 --> 01:35:46.295
Now, the...

01:35:49.131 --> 01:35:51.310
- Sorry about your eye.
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:35:52.092 --> 01:35:53.104
Hi!

01:35:53.135 --> 01:35:55.106
- It's for her.
- That's my mom.

01:35:55.262 --> 01:35:58.150
It's important for her.
It's emotional support.

01:35:58.182 --> 01:35:59.256
I'll give you five bucks.

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:01.247
OK, thanks. OK.

01:36:02.238 --> 01:36:04.177
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:36:06.231 --> 01:36:08.192
I'm so sorry for the interruption.

01:36:08.223 --> 01:36:10.341
These are my sorority sisters.

01:36:11.122 --> 01:36:12.343
Hey. It's me, Helen.

01:36:13.125 --> 01:36:14.157
I know.

01:36:14.188 --> 01:36:15.335
He knows that.

01:36:17.191 --> 01:36:19.110
You got this, Mom.

01:36:24.292 --> 01:36:28.296
A group of archaeologists
using carbon dating

01:36:28.327 --> 01:36:32.175
proved that the grave was in fact a hoax.

01:36:32.206 --> 01:36:35.334
There were so many scientists involved
that it was...

01:36:38.212 --> 01:36:40.350
..it was standing tomb only.

01:36:41.132 --> 01:36:43.259
Whoo!

01:36:45.157 --> 01:36:48.149
Thank you. I wasn't sure about that one.

01:36:48.369 --> 01:36:51.383
Now I hope that you're all Hungary...

01:36:52.165 --> 01:36:53.301
..for some facts

01:36:53.332 --> 01:36:58.150
because I'm about to give you
the thrilla about Attila.

01:36:58.181 --> 01:37:00.267
Guys, that's my mom. She's killing it!

01:37:00.298 --> 01:37:02.248
Go, Dee!

01:37:10.349 --> 01:37:12.372
OK, guys, thanks.

01:37:13.332 --> 01:37:16.241
Number one, there was
no Professor Rümschtein.

01:37:16.272 --> 01:37:17.410
Complete, complete hoax.

01:37:18.191 --> 01:37:20.172
This person didn't exist, PR fact.

01:37:20.203 --> 01:37:22.269
I know. I was shocked
when I found out, too.

01:37:23.311 --> 01:37:25.418
These young men and women
comport themselves

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.233
with astounding grace and wisdom.

01:37:28.264 --> 01:37:30.391
Every one of them
brings tremendous pride

01:37:30.423 --> 01:37:33.186
to this hallowed institution.

01:37:33.217 --> 01:37:34.343
And on a personal note,

01:37:34.374 --> 01:37:38.316
I will say that the future of this world
is in pretty good hands.

01:37:38.347 --> 01:37:42.216
You may now move your tassels to the left.

01:37:42.247 --> 01:37:48.263
Congratulations to Decatur University's
graduating class of 2018.

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:51.412
Whoo!

01:37:53.447 --> 01:37:55.449
- Hey, Christine!
- Hey!

01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:58.273
- Congratulations!
- Proud of you!

01:37:58.306 --> 01:37:59.338
- Thank you.
- I love you.

01:37:59.369 --> 01:38:00.412
I love you, too.

01:38:00.443 --> 01:38:02.435
Come on.
Let's go make love in the science lab.

01:38:03.217 --> 01:38:04.405
OK. Be right back.

01:38:04.437 --> 01:38:05.448
OK.

01:38:06.230 --> 01:38:07.461
Hey, Mom! Hi.

01:38:08.243 --> 01:38:10.380
- I'm so proud!
- Congrats, baby.

01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:12.413
- Thank you for coming.
- Look at our girl.

01:38:12.445 --> 01:38:14.384
Sweetheart!

01:38:14.415 --> 01:38:16.345
- Congrats.
- Thank you, honey.

01:38:16.376 --> 01:38:17.439
- I'm ready.
- You look great!

01:38:17.471 --> 01:38:19.306
I'm so proud of you guys.

01:38:19.337 --> 01:38:22.455
You two have made an old man very happy.

01:38:23.237 --> 01:38:26.365
My daughter, my granddaughter,
both got a degree today.

01:38:26.396 --> 01:38:28.294
Screw you, Dan!

01:38:28.325 --> 01:38:29.368
- Dad!
- Grandpa!

01:38:29.399 --> 01:38:31.266
- What?
- Hey.

01:38:31.297 --> 01:38:33.435
I'm starving. Can we please
go to Mike and Sandy's house?

01:38:33.467 --> 01:38:36.428
You know what?
We'll catch up with you in a minute.

01:38:36.459 --> 01:38:39.452
But I just want...
just a moment here with my girl.

01:38:39.483 --> 01:38:41.423
- OK, babe.
- Sure, honey.

01:38:42.497 --> 01:38:44.467
- Bye.
- You get out.

01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:53.351
Look at us! Couple of college grads!

01:38:53.383 --> 01:38:55.468
Mom, you did it. You got your degree.

01:38:55.499 --> 01:38:57.459
I'm so proud of you.

01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.275
I'm proud of me, too.

01:39:00.306 --> 01:39:02.277
But I'm really proud of you.

01:39:02.308 --> 01:39:04.383
I hope you soak it all in.
This is your big day.

01:39:04.414 --> 01:39:07.313
I will. Wait, you didn't throw your hat!

01:39:07.344 --> 01:39:09.483
I think there were so many people

01:39:09.514 --> 01:39:12.496
and I just want to keep it
as a memento for my alma mater.

01:39:12.528 --> 01:39:14.446
You can keep it, but you gotta throw it.

01:39:14.477 --> 01:39:18.325
- You don't wanna jinx it.
- OK. I don't wanna jinx myself.

01:39:18.356 --> 01:39:19.524
- Yeah, already.
- All right, here goes!

01:39:20.306 --> 01:39:21.349
Whoo!

01:39:24.467 --> 01:39:26.354
- My God.
- Who did that?

01:39:26.385 --> 01:39:28.491
Marcie, the earring. It's gone.

01:39:28.523 --> 01:39:30.368
That's a half-carat.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:32.412
- Don't move.
- You're such a fool.

01:39:32.443 --> 01:39:33.507
- We should go.
- OK.

01:39:33.538 --> 01:39:35.457
