WEBVTT

00:03.614 --> 00:04.867
Good morning.

00:04.990 --> 00:06.326
Hey.

00:07.018 --> 00:08.183
Saw you posted a picture

00:08.209 --> 00:09.617
at Wine Fest. How was it?

00:09.891 --> 00:11.531
Great until I got drunk

00:11.556 --> 00:13.849
off a flight of Pinots from Oregon.

00:13.895 --> 00:15.015
Thought you didn't care for Pinot.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.601
Well, I don't, but Phillip...

00:17.453 --> 00:20.230
Just thought I would try
something different.

00:21.094 --> 00:22.857
- Glad you had a good time.
- Thanks.

00:25.277 --> 00:26.486
- Dr. Manning?
- Yeah.

00:26.511 --> 00:27.766
Treatment 4.

00:27.791 --> 00:29.659
16-year-old female, 38 weeks pregnant.

00:29.684 --> 00:30.984
Rear-ended while she was driving.

00:31.009 --> 00:32.994
Now I cleared her C-spine
and she has labs brewing,

00:33.019 --> 00:34.273
but I figured you could check her cervix

00:34.298 --> 00:35.015
before calling the OB.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.371
- Sure.
- Great.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.369
Lily? Hi, I'm Dr. Manning.

00:41.394 --> 00:43.420
Uh, I understand you're 38 weeks.

00:44.049 --> 00:44.951
Are you family?

00:44.976 --> 00:46.965
I'm her father, yes. Joseph Cooper.

00:46.990 --> 00:49.824
- And this is Edie Thompson.
- I'm not family exactly.

00:49.849 --> 00:50.969
She's, uh...

00:50.993 --> 00:53.137
Uh, she's adopting my baby.

00:53.475 --> 00:56.140
Great. All right, well,
let's take a look.

01:01.318 --> 01:02.856
- Thanks.
- Mmhmm.

01:04.727 --> 01:07.875
Baby looks healthy and
the placenta looks good.

01:08.189 --> 01:09.761
All right, Lily, if it's okay with you,

01:09.786 --> 01:11.739
I'm going to ask your dad and
Edie to step out of the room

01:11.764 --> 01:13.445
- while I check your cervix.
- Okay.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.118
We'll be right outside, honey.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.495
Thank you.

01:17.462 --> 01:21.037
All right, now you let me know
if anything's uncomfortable

01:21.062 --> 01:22.727
- or if you feel any pain, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.752 --> 01:24.125
All right, if you could
just put your knees up

01:24.150 --> 01:27.102
and then let them fall open. Thank you.

01:27.807 --> 01:29.382
All right, you ready?

01:30.198 --> 01:32.203
You okay?

01:32.228 --> 01:33.303
Mm-hmm.

01:36.224 --> 01:37.723
Everything okay?

01:37.748 --> 01:39.184
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:39.209 --> 01:41.658
Um, I'm feeling that you're
2 centimeters dilated

01:41.683 --> 01:44.344
and seeing that you
started contractions.

01:44.369 --> 01:45.622
What does that mean?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.777
Oh, I think the car accident
caused you to start labor.

01:48.802 --> 01:51.696
You've got to stop it. I
don't want to see the baby.

01:51.721 --> 01:53.250
That's why I scheduled a C-section.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.992
I'm sorry, Lily, but it
doesn't work that way.

01:55.017 --> 01:57.952
Um, you can't stop labor
once the baby is full term.

01:57.977 --> 01:58.938
I just want to be put to sleep

01:58.963 --> 02:00.580
and wake up with it gone, okay?

02:00.605 --> 02:02.273
I will call Labor and Delivery

02:02.298 --> 02:04.167
and see what we can do, okay?

02:06.871 --> 02:08.015
Now what's that called again?

02:08.041 --> 02:10.591
Turmeric latte with macadamia nut milk.

02:11.270 --> 02:14.959
Whatever happened to
just plain old coffee?

02:14.984 --> 02:17.772
Okay, okay. Now just a reminder.

02:17.797 --> 02:18.784
According to our calendar,

02:18.809 --> 02:20.484
next Wednesday we got that
appointment with a broker

02:20.509 --> 02:21.685
to find you an apartment.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.109
Danny, why are you
talking about something

02:23.134 --> 02:24.430
that's not happening for a week?

02:24.455 --> 02:26.352
Cece, this stuff is not
gonna take care of itself.

02:26.377 --> 02:28.210
Yeah, but can't we just
visit it with the people?

02:28.235 --> 02:30.492
- We're visiting!
- You know Dad likes to plan.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.570
Yeah, I guess he never
read "Be Here Now."

02:33.595 --> 02:34.989
I'm here now.

02:36.579 --> 02:39.616
Gwen, I want to be absolutely
clear on this, okay?

02:39.641 --> 02:40.966
From what I am seeing,

02:40.991 --> 02:42.952
this growth you keep talking about

02:42.977 --> 02:44.242
is virtually nonexistent.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.959
I am confident we'll see a
marked increase next quarter.

02:46.984 --> 02:47.984
Next quarter?

02:48.009 --> 02:49.672
That's what you said last quarter.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.116
Mr. Rhodes?

02:52.141 --> 02:53.925
Dad? Dad, hey.

02:53.950 --> 02:56.052
Hey, easy there. Easy.

02:56.077 --> 02:57.887
Is everything all right?

02:57.912 --> 02:58.929
I'm fine.

02:59.862 --> 03:01.682
Just give us a minute, will you?

03:01.961 --> 03:03.017
Thank you.

03:05.201 --> 03:07.134
Okay.

03:07.778 --> 03:10.578
Your pulse is racing and you
can't catch your breath.

03:10.603 --> 03:12.452
Incompetence makes my blood boil.

03:12.477 --> 03:13.676
What can I say?

03:13.701 --> 03:15.779
- You having chest pains?
- No.

03:15.979 --> 03:17.239
Really?

03:18.019 --> 03:20.070
Dad, there is clearly something
going on with your heart.

03:20.095 --> 03:21.548
We should get you seen
by a cardiologist.

03:21.573 --> 03:22.695
Well, that's not gonna happen today.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.206
I've got too much on my plate.

03:24.231 --> 03:25.819
Just let me take you to the ED.

03:25.844 --> 03:27.250
I'll check you out myself.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.211
It'll only take a couple
of minutes, I promise.

03:29.236 --> 03:31.069
Connor, please. Just stop it, all right?

03:31.094 --> 03:32.755
I'm absolute...

03:33.066 --> 03:34.550
Ooh!

03:41.194 --> 03:43.695
Hey. So good news.

03:43.720 --> 03:46.460
Dr. Patchefsky called and
she can schedule you

03:46.485 --> 03:48.919
for a C-section today if
you still wanna do that.

03:49.223 --> 03:51.180
So that means the baby's coming today?

03:51.205 --> 03:51.906
Mm-hmm.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.539
Oh, that's... That's incredible.

03:53.564 --> 03:54.763
I-I have to text Howard.

03:54.788 --> 03:55.992
Are you sure you're okay, sweetie?

03:56.017 --> 03:57.195
I know this is a lot.

03:57.220 --> 03:58.949
I'm ready to get it over with, Dad.

03:59.144 --> 04:00.805
All right, well, we'll send you upstairs

04:00.830 --> 04:03.064
as soon as a bed becomes
available, okay?

04:04.002 --> 04:06.023
And where's Lily at? Lily Cooper?

04:06.048 --> 04:08.148
David, what are you doing here?

04:08.173 --> 04:09.835
Hi, Jessie told me. Are you all right?

04:09.860 --> 04:11.753
- You need to leave.
- It's okay, Dad.

04:12.026 --> 04:15.507
I'm fine, but they say the
baby's coming out today.

04:15.532 --> 04:17.341
It... it's happening now?

04:17.367 --> 04:20.178
- You better go, David.
- That's right!

04:21.233 --> 04:23.849
I'm ready to take care
of you and our baby.

04:23.927 --> 04:25.475
You're telling me this now?

04:25.500 --> 04:26.810
Yeah, you never answer my calls.

04:27.131 --> 04:28.895
All right, I get that you're mad.

04:29.148 --> 04:30.250
When you told me,

04:30.275 --> 04:33.275
I'd just lost my job and my mom was sick

04:33.504 --> 04:34.789
and I freaked out.

04:34.814 --> 04:36.429
But I got a good job now, all right?

04:36.454 --> 04:38.256
They're paying me 12 an hour at the...

04:38.281 --> 04:39.867
At the tire and rim...
It's too late, David!

04:39.892 --> 04:42.028
No, listen, listen, they're
giving me full-time hours.

04:42.053 --> 04:43.516
That's enough! You need to leave.

04:43.541 --> 04:44.785
No, no. This isn't about me.

04:44.810 --> 04:45.937
Maybe I should wait in the lobby?

04:45.962 --> 04:47.390
No, no. He's the one who's leaving.

04:47.415 --> 04:48.578
Hey, Maggie, call security?

04:48.603 --> 04:50.383
- Dad, stop! Please!
- Don't touch me.

04:50.670 --> 04:52.453
All right, I'm going to need you
to wait in the lobby, okay?

04:52.478 --> 04:53.664
But that... that... that...
that... That's my baby!

04:53.689 --> 04:55.463
- Not anymore!
- Security.

04:55.488 --> 04:56.688
Well, what does that mean?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.009
What does that... What
does that mean? Lily?

04:59.732 --> 05:02.007
I'm giving the baby up.

05:04.857 --> 05:06.133
Did he talk you into this?

05:06.158 --> 05:07.727
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, that's my kid!

05:07.751 --> 05:09.921
You can't take... no, no!
You can't just take my kid.

05:09.946 --> 05:12.031
Let go, son! Hey, hey!

05:12.056 --> 05:13.691
- Let's go, son.
- I'm the father! I have a say!

05:13.716 --> 05:17.555
Hey! Let go! Hey, no! You
can't take me from my kid!

05:17.580 --> 05:21.114
That's my kid! Let go!
You can't do this!

05:39.580 --> 05:42.569
David Novak? Hi.

05:42.594 --> 05:44.344
- Hi.
- I'm Sharon Goodwin.

05:44.369 --> 05:46.500
Director of Patient Services.

05:46.525 --> 05:47.539
Why don't we have a seat?

05:47.564 --> 05:49.977
- I want to see Lily.
- I understand that.

05:50.002 --> 05:52.960
Hey, no, no, then tell this
rent-a-cop to back off.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.649
Oh, I'm sorry but it's hospital policy

05:55.674 --> 05:58.131
to restrict access
only to those visitors

05:58.156 --> 05:59.422
approved by our patient.

05:59.447 --> 06:02.815
That's my baby she's having.
I don't have any rights?

06:02.920 --> 06:05.051
According to the adoption papers,

06:05.076 --> 06:08.422
Lily is not certain who
the birth father is.

06:08.447 --> 06:09.579
No, that's crazy.

06:09.686 --> 06:11.927
All right, I'm... I'm the only
one she's ever been with.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.234
All right, her dad is
just making her say that

06:14.259 --> 06:16.420
so that he can give this baby away.

06:17.204 --> 06:19.130
How old are you, David?

06:19.784 --> 06:21.257
Seventeen...

06:22.156 --> 06:23.635
and a half.

06:23.859 --> 06:25.846
How did you and Lily meet?

06:26.076 --> 06:27.179
How did we meet?

06:27.204 --> 06:29.890
Well, I like to hear those stories.

06:30.685 --> 06:34.770
I saw her in... in
line at the cafeteria.

06:34.934 --> 06:36.857
Oh, so you met at school.

06:36.882 --> 06:39.484
- Yeah, Marie Curie.
- Archer Heights?

06:39.618 --> 06:41.903
Well, let me... Let me ask you, um,

06:42.333 --> 06:46.742
is there anyone that I can
help you with this situation?

06:46.767 --> 06:48.015
A family member?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.580
Maybe someone who can
speak to Lily's father.

06:52.298 --> 06:53.406
No.

06:53.431 --> 06:56.398
You know, technically, I'm
not supposed to do this,

06:56.423 --> 06:59.546
but let me recommend a lawyer for you,

06:59.571 --> 07:02.548
someone who specializes in Family Law.

07:02.841 --> 07:06.363
I just need to get to Lily
before my kid is born.

07:06.388 --> 07:08.180
Can you... can you help me with that?

07:08.205 --> 07:11.933
I'm sorry, David. I can't.

07:21.905 --> 07:23.820
- Hey, Maggie?
- Yeah.

07:24.009 --> 07:25.960
Can you see if you can rustle up an EKG

07:25.985 --> 07:27.212
and chest x-ray in 2?

07:27.237 --> 07:29.744
And have cardiology come
down to do a stat echo.

07:29.769 --> 07:31.411
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

07:33.501 --> 07:34.967
You're examining your father?

07:34.992 --> 07:37.559
Just a cursory cardiac check-up.

07:37.733 --> 07:38.626
Huh.

07:38.682 --> 07:40.753
A doctor shouldn't be treating
a close family member,

07:40.778 --> 07:42.578
especially one with a fraught history.

07:42.773 --> 07:44.673
Whatever you're doing,
Ava, I'm not interested.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.429
What I'm doing is rising
above any personal animus

07:47.454 --> 07:48.986
I might have to help a colleague.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.681
Well, this colleague
doesn't need your help.

07:54.172 --> 07:55.602
Thank you.

08:01.043 --> 08:03.694
All right. Take a deep breath.

08:03.719 --> 08:06.154
And exhale.

08:07.336 --> 08:09.656
Saw you with your
little friend out here.

08:09.886 --> 08:11.886
What were you two talking about?

08:14.123 --> 08:16.466
Well, there's some fluid in your lungs

08:16.491 --> 08:18.202
which explains the shortness of breath.

08:18.593 --> 08:20.623
And I'm picking up a heart murmur.

08:20.648 --> 08:21.880
I know about the murmur.

08:21.905 --> 08:24.202
My GP told me about
that a long time ago.

08:25.112 --> 08:27.155
You know what? Excuse me. I'm done.

08:27.180 --> 08:28.381
I'm gonna get dressed.

08:28.406 --> 08:30.577
Fine.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.347
I will get started on your discharge.

08:37.519 --> 08:39.674
Tell me if this hurts, okay, Joshua?

08:39.700 --> 08:40.645
Okay.

08:40.671 --> 08:43.144
His temperature was 102, which
didn't seem crazy to me

08:43.169 --> 08:45.469
because he was already home
sick from school, you know?

08:45.559 --> 08:48.196
But I called his mom and she
said just take him to the ER.

08:48.711 --> 08:50.176
Where is my mom?

08:50.201 --> 08:52.144
She's on her way, buddy.
Okay? Don't worry.

08:52.169 --> 08:54.769
I'm gonna need to draw a
little blood from you, Joshua,

08:54.794 --> 08:55.957
in order to run some tests.

08:55.982 --> 08:57.081
Would that be okay?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.621
Great.

08:58.646 --> 09:00.457
I'm just gonna go find one
of our super nice nurses

09:00.482 --> 09:01.781
to help us out.

09:02.070 --> 09:03.575
I'll be right back.

09:06.888 --> 09:10.635
And my car key is in the diaper bag.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.473
- Okay? All right.
- Thanks.

09:12.498 --> 09:14.707
Are you sure you can't come up
stairs while he gets his shots?

09:14.732 --> 09:16.207
I mean, Vincent's so
much calmer with you.

09:16.232 --> 09:18.739
I gotta work, Emily. He'll be fine.

09:19.317 --> 09:21.520
- Hey, Ethan.
- Hey.

09:22.214 --> 09:23.898
April, got a patient.

09:24.427 --> 09:26.318
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

09:26.518 --> 09:28.152
Sorry, I'm late.

09:29.431 --> 09:30.881
What? Just say it.

09:31.212 --> 09:32.801
You know better than anyone
my sister is trouble

09:32.826 --> 09:34.980
and yet here you are letting
her take over your life.

09:35.005 --> 09:37.171
I am helping out a young mother

09:37.196 --> 09:39.329
who also happens to be your sister.

09:40.044 --> 09:42.301
Dr. Choi? I gotta make a phone call.

09:42.326 --> 09:44.272
Is it okay if I step
outside for a second?

09:44.297 --> 09:46.020
Sure, we'll keep an eye on Joshua.

09:48.152 --> 09:50.519
That kid in 7's been
battling a persistent fever.

09:50.544 --> 09:53.355
I need a CBC, CMP and
some cultures, please.

09:53.380 --> 09:54.980
All right.

09:57.142 --> 09:59.309
And the baby looks good,
so we're gonna take you up

09:59.334 --> 10:01.137
and get you prepped for the c-section.

10:01.162 --> 10:02.793
- Are you ready?
- I guess.

10:02.818 --> 10:03.950
It's going to be fine.

10:03.975 --> 10:05.051
Hey Maggie, will you page OB

10:05.076 --> 10:06.242
and tell them we're on our way up?

10:06.267 --> 10:08.109
- Copy that.
- Thanks.

10:10.515 --> 10:11.514
David.

10:11.539 --> 10:14.157
Don't worry, I'm gonna
take care of everything.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.741
What are you doing?

10:15.766 --> 10:18.327
Whoa. David, put that down.

10:18.352 --> 10:19.340
You think I'm gonna let you come in here

10:19.365 --> 10:20.871
and steal my kid?

10:21.122 --> 10:23.542
Dad, Dad, Dad, no. Dad, stop!

10:23.567 --> 10:26.026
Security, code silver!
Active threat in the ED!

10:27.320 --> 10:29.464
Dad! Dad!

10:29.604 --> 10:30.903
Oh, my God.

10:30.928 --> 10:32.739
David, no. David.

10:32.764 --> 10:34.177
Drop your weapon!

10:37.859 --> 10:39.598
Oh, my God.

10:47.507 --> 10:48.863
Dad!

10:53.564 --> 10:55.731
David!

10:55.896 --> 10:57.105
No, no, no, no...

10:57.130 --> 11:00.020
- Dad!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

11:00.045 --> 11:02.377
- Stop! Stop!
- No, drop it! Drop it! Now!

11:02.402 --> 11:05.000
Frank, listen to the man. Listen to him.

11:09.354 --> 11:11.713
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm a doctor!

11:11.738 --> 11:13.883
Let me just take a look. Okay.

11:24.060 --> 11:26.729
Don't move! Don't!

11:37.680 --> 11:39.276
What's happening? Was that a gun?

11:39.301 --> 11:41.030
Stay quiet.

11:41.055 --> 11:42.996
Just stay quiet.

11:43.735 --> 11:46.002
Hey, hey, hey! I said stop moving!

11:46.027 --> 11:47.465
- Dad!
- Stop moving!

11:47.490 --> 11:50.028
Dad, Dad, are you okay?
Please help my dad!

11:50.523 --> 11:52.297
I'm a doctor. I can help.

11:52.322 --> 11:54.356
- Get... get in there. Now.
- This room here?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.091
Yeah, yeah. Now, now.

11:56.281 --> 11:57.622
Dad!

12:07.366 --> 12:09.146
We need to help this man.

12:09.171 --> 12:12.399
Daddy! Dad!

12:12.638 --> 12:13.990
It wasn't my fault.

12:14.015 --> 12:16.098
But you don't want him to die, do you?

12:16.243 --> 12:18.029
No. Help him, help him.

12:18.054 --> 12:19.353
- Okay.
- Help him.

12:19.378 --> 12:22.243
- Lily?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay.

12:22.268 --> 12:24.287
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

12:24.312 --> 12:26.246
Hey, hey, hey!

12:27.308 --> 12:29.684
Hey! How do I lock the doors?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.501
- You need keys.
- Get them!

12:31.526 --> 12:33.628
Now! Now!

12:36.931 --> 12:38.364
Easy, easy!

12:40.562 --> 12:43.348
All right, lock all the doors. Now!

12:47.282 --> 12:49.512
Hey, they... hey, they can see me!

12:49.537 --> 12:51.856
Hey, they can see where I...
They're gonna shoot me!

12:51.881 --> 12:53.232
All right.

12:53.491 --> 12:54.790
Hey, you!

12:55.011 --> 12:56.819
I have to cover the windows!
What do I use?

12:56.844 --> 12:58.112
I don't know.

12:58.137 --> 12:59.770
How about... how about...
How about the sheets?

12:59.795 --> 13:01.199
All right, you have
lots of those, right?

13:01.224 --> 13:03.408
All right, do it. Now.

13:04.753 --> 13:06.977
You... you help them.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.638
Maggie, what's going on?

13:33.064 --> 13:34.698
Hey, hey, kid.

13:34.723 --> 13:37.688
I need to get this guy
to a trauma room now.

13:37.713 --> 13:39.195
Do you understand me?

13:40.025 --> 13:41.492
Yeah, okay.

13:41.517 --> 13:43.446
Maggie, I need a backboard now.

13:43.471 --> 13:46.258
David, they're going to
need my help to lift him.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.494
All right.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.955
But right after, you're right
back where I can see you, okay?

13:49.980 --> 13:51.546
All right, keep pressure on it.

13:51.571 --> 13:53.750
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

13:53.775 --> 13:55.627
Come on, man.

13:56.541 --> 13:59.307
All right, all right.

13:59.332 --> 14:01.165
There we go.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.431
Dad? Dad, are you okay?

14:10.456 --> 14:13.640
Listen, I just want to get my girlfriend

14:13.665 --> 14:15.264
and my baby out of here.

14:15.415 --> 14:16.896
I don't want to hurt anybody else,

14:16.921 --> 14:19.235
but I will if you get in my way.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.487
Hey, you. Back where you were.

14:23.371 --> 14:24.865
I got this.

14:28.845 --> 14:31.145
- How's he doing?
- Not good, David.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.408
He's bleeding from inside his chest.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.626
Well, it's his fault.
He grabbed the gun.

14:35.651 --> 14:37.835
- Breathe, breathe.
- I don't care.

14:37.860 --> 14:39.744
He needs to go upstairs for surgery.

14:40.197 --> 14:43.383
No. He stays here, all right?

14:43.408 --> 14:46.303
He might not make it if you
don't let him go upstairs.

14:46.734 --> 14:49.806
Okay, breathe, yeah.

14:50.660 --> 14:52.684
You're a doctor. Do something!

14:52.709 --> 14:55.645
I need blood, plasma, and platelets.

14:55.670 --> 14:57.855
Now! Otherwise he dies.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.705
Okay, what do I... What do I do?

14:59.730 --> 15:01.563
Pick up any one of those
phones and dial 911

15:01.588 --> 15:02.822
and tell them who you are.

15:03.088 --> 15:04.863
They'll find someone for you to ask.

15:05.267 --> 15:08.033
Now! Okay.

15:11.489 --> 15:12.877
He's got a pulmonary embolism.

15:12.902 --> 15:14.623
So let East Mercy know
he's on a heparin drip

15:14.648 --> 15:16.759
- and monitor his vitals closely.
- Yes, doctor.

15:16.784 --> 15:19.126
Is this the last of our
emergency patients?

15:19.151 --> 15:20.753
The last we could get out.

15:20.778 --> 15:22.760
Miss Goodwin, the gunman just called

15:22.785 --> 15:24.451
with a list of supplies they need.

15:24.476 --> 15:27.094
He's insisting that you
bring the supplies in.

15:27.119 --> 15:28.226
Me?

15:28.251 --> 15:29.423
Yeah, he says you tried to help him.

15:29.448 --> 15:31.806
It seems he doesn't trust anyone else.

15:34.254 --> 15:37.291
You're completely dilated. We've
have to deliver the baby.

15:37.316 --> 15:38.949
No, I don't want to push it out.

15:38.974 --> 15:41.341
I know this isn't how
you wanted it to happen

15:41.366 --> 15:42.985
but we cannot wait any longer.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.603
Can't you just do the c-section?

15:44.628 --> 15:46.025
It's not safe to do out here.

15:46.050 --> 15:49.326
I'm sorry Lily, but I need
you to deliver this baby.

15:49.351 --> 15:51.478
Okay? I'll be right back.

15:51.503 --> 15:53.050
Hey.

15:53.075 --> 15:54.624
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. Hey, stay there.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.790
- What do you want?
- Lily's about to deliver.

15:56.815 --> 15:58.982
I just need you to get me a precip pack.

15:59.007 --> 16:00.086
It's for the delivery.

16:00.111 --> 16:02.422
They're in the blue boxes in the Pyxis.

16:02.447 --> 16:03.689
Okay, just right over there.

16:03.714 --> 16:07.064
You heard her. You get it.

16:07.469 --> 16:09.220
Go, now.

16:15.668 --> 16:18.814
You get in there. Go. Now, now.

16:18.839 --> 16:20.705
Just breathe. It's okay.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.228
You're okay, you're okay.

16:22.253 --> 16:23.953
Just keep breathing. You're doing great.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.169
It's going to be okay, Lily.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.073
I promise. It's going to be okay.

16:29.098 --> 16:30.657
You shot my dad.

16:32.220 --> 16:34.995
Keep breathing, Lily.

16:35.586 --> 16:37.625
It was an accident. I swear...
I swear it was.

16:37.650 --> 16:38.915
But there's a doctor looking at him...

16:38.940 --> 16:40.853
There's a doctor looking at
him right now, all right?

16:40.878 --> 16:41.918
And it... it's going to be okay.

16:41.943 --> 16:44.421
I promise you. He's going to be okay.

16:45.164 --> 16:47.164
Dr. Manning is gonna need
another set of hands

16:47.189 --> 16:48.422
to deliver your child.

16:48.447 --> 16:49.751
Okay, yeah.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.314
Help her, help her, help
her, help her, help her.

16:51.339 --> 16:53.055
You've got this, Lily. Keep breathing.

16:55.359 --> 16:57.418
I just couldn't let him take
our baby like that, Lily.

16:57.443 --> 16:59.561
I could... I couldn't do it.

17:00.132 --> 17:02.564
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.358
Yeah, you're doing great, Lily.

17:05.384 --> 17:07.884
Just keep looking at me, okay? Breathe.

17:07.909 --> 17:09.009
Breathe with me, Lily.

17:10.913 --> 17:12.244
We can raise this kid together.

17:12.270 --> 17:13.703
I know we can.

17:13.846 --> 17:15.828
And I know that's what you want too.

17:15.853 --> 17:17.162
No.

17:17.186 --> 17:19.748
I just want my life
to go back to normal.

17:19.780 --> 17:22.288
I wanna finish high school.
I wanna go to college.

17:22.313 --> 17:24.538
No, no, no, no. That's your
dad talking, all right?

17:24.563 --> 17:26.829
And I'm gonna fix everything
as soon as we get out of here.

17:28.573 --> 17:29.800
Hey.

17:30.304 --> 17:31.425
Get back!

17:31.450 --> 17:33.261
Get back!

17:33.363 --> 17:36.865
Hey, hey, get back!

17:36.890 --> 17:38.516
You stay where I can see you.

17:38.541 --> 17:39.603
All right?

17:39.628 --> 17:40.936
You!

17:41.171 --> 17:43.813
You. Get those cuffs. Now.

17:47.314 --> 17:49.319
Don't move or I'll kill you.

17:52.661 --> 17:54.740
Cuff him to that desk.

18:01.339 --> 18:03.583
I want my mommy!

18:04.027 --> 18:06.627
Take... take care of that kid.

18:06.933 --> 18:09.423
Baby, let's get you back
in the bed, come on!

18:09.643 --> 18:11.842
Just get back in the bed, okay?

18:14.368 --> 18:16.514
Easy. Take it easy.

18:16.539 --> 18:18.807
Take down these curtains!

18:20.936 --> 18:24.772
I will shoot the next
person that tries anything!

18:29.371 --> 18:32.781
Sharon, please. Let me
switch places with you.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.844
I... I have a tremendous
amount of experience

18:34.869 --> 18:36.793
dealing with people in
David's emotional state.

18:36.818 --> 18:37.817
It's what I'm trained to do.

18:37.842 --> 18:39.869
Oh, well, I appreciate it, Daniel,

18:39.894 --> 18:42.965
but I think we should follow
David's instructions.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.599
Okay, this is everything on the list.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.877
All right, thank you, Monique.

18:46.902 --> 18:48.435
Okay, listen,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.506
people who are as desperate as he is,

18:50.531 --> 18:52.036
they need to know that
there's a possibility

18:52.061 --> 18:52.622
of a happy ending.

18:52.647 --> 18:55.469
Daniel, I'm going to be okay.

18:55.796 --> 18:57.504
I really want you to be careful, okay?

18:57.529 --> 18:59.012
- I know.
- Be careful.

18:59.037 --> 19:00.670
- I will.
- Miss Goodwin.

19:01.163 --> 19:03.163
Need to show you something
before you go in.

19:04.932 --> 19:06.630
Now the gunman has blanketed the windows

19:06.655 --> 19:08.555
to obscure our view, but
there is a small gap

19:08.580 --> 19:10.483
that gives James here a clean shot.

19:10.508 --> 19:13.152
Now go ahead, have a look.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.199
That's the kill zone.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.926
Uh, look, I'd like to get this resolved

19:21.951 --> 19:23.817
without anyone else...

19:23.842 --> 19:25.642
Getting hurt. I understand.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.481
But that young man has
already shot two people.

19:28.506 --> 19:32.421
You walk him into that spot
and no one else gets hurt.

19:32.446 --> 19:33.798
All right?

19:33.823 --> 19:35.509
Good luck in there.

19:35.928 --> 19:38.137
Open it!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.054
Get in!

19:44.567 --> 19:46.604
Keys, keys, keys.

19:46.629 --> 19:48.021
David.

19:48.779 --> 19:51.775
David, what are you doing with the gun?

19:52.008 --> 19:53.609
Just help me.

19:53.704 --> 19:54.945
Okay?

19:56.207 --> 19:58.532
He's that way.

20:01.615 --> 20:02.870
Come on.

20:10.679 --> 20:11.912
Sharon?

20:13.075 --> 20:15.548
All right, hang one to one to
one on the rapid transfuser

20:15.573 --> 20:16.411
and keep going.

20:16.436 --> 20:17.935
Do not let his blood pressure drop.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.177
Got it.

20:19.202 --> 20:21.114
Do you know how the other
patients are doing?

20:21.139 --> 20:22.286
My father's in 2.

20:22.311 --> 20:23.965
He's got something going
on with his heart.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.766
Earl got hit by a bullet.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.024
Ethan said he was going to be okay.

20:27.049 --> 20:29.354
And April's got a sick kid in 7.

20:29.998 --> 20:32.024
Chest tube auto transfuser's full.

20:32.049 --> 20:33.249
All right, run it back to him.

20:33.274 --> 20:34.906
- Got it.
- How's he doing?

20:34.931 --> 20:36.731
His heart rate will come
down thanks to the blood,

20:36.756 --> 20:38.238
but he's still hemorrhaging
into his chest.

20:38.263 --> 20:40.797
If we don't get him upstairs
soon, we're gonna lose him.

20:41.217 --> 20:42.658
Okay.

20:46.661 --> 20:50.130
David, Lily's father
is not going to last

20:50.155 --> 20:51.918
much longer down here.

20:51.943 --> 20:53.255
Uh, but the doctor said he needed blood

20:53.280 --> 20:54.106
and they got him blood.

20:54.131 --> 20:57.380
He needs surgery and a full trauma team

20:57.568 --> 21:00.009
if he's going to survive.

21:00.791 --> 21:03.372
Just Lily's dad. No one else.

21:03.397 --> 21:06.307
But I've got a very sick
little boy down there

21:06.332 --> 21:08.935
and... and a man with a bad heart.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.522
They need to go too.

21:10.547 --> 21:11.980
No.

21:12.626 --> 21:16.236
Just Lily's dad and then we'll see.

21:16.968 --> 21:19.820
Okay. Okay.

21:25.738 --> 21:28.430
Um, Dr. Rhodes, get your patient ready

21:28.455 --> 21:30.457
to move out of the ED.

21:35.243 --> 21:38.006
We're going to wheel him out.
Whoever's back there, back up!

21:38.030 --> 21:39.099
All right.

21:39.124 --> 21:41.004
Wait!

21:43.297 --> 21:45.297
Hey, hey, hey!

21:45.322 --> 21:46.988
Back up! I swear to God, I'll kill her.

21:47.013 --> 21:48.286
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I swear to God!

21:48.311 --> 21:49.739
Lower your weapons!

21:49.764 --> 21:52.606
Step back! We need to move
this patient through!

21:52.631 --> 21:55.482
- Back up! Back up!
- Lower your weapons!

21:55.507 --> 21:58.732
- Back up now! Now!
- Move, move, move, move, move.

21:59.103 --> 22:00.896
- Okay, grab this.
- Move, move!

22:00.929 --> 22:02.028
Move, move, move!

22:02.053 --> 22:04.366
Close it! Close it now! Now!

22:08.841 --> 22:11.090
You better not try anything else!

22:11.115 --> 22:12.432
David, please.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.371
Let me talk to the police for you,

22:14.396 --> 22:16.121
try to figure a way out of this.

22:16.146 --> 22:16.941
No!

22:16.966 --> 22:19.666
Hey, I need a doctor in here.

22:19.708 --> 22:22.008
This boy is not responding
to his medication.

22:22.033 --> 22:23.385
I can't get his fever down.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.346
David, please, just uncuff
me so I can check on him.

22:26.371 --> 22:28.808
Do you think I'm stupid?

22:29.649 --> 22:31.978
Deal with the kid yourself.

22:38.282 --> 22:40.944
Nat, fetal heart tones just
flipped to the other side.

22:40.969 --> 22:42.279
I just felt something shift.

22:42.304 --> 22:43.837
Does that mean the baby's coming out?

22:43.862 --> 22:44.739
Let me see.

22:47.183 --> 22:48.785
The baby just went transverse.

22:48.810 --> 22:49.864
Wait, what does that mean?

22:49.889 --> 22:51.705
The baby's turned
sideways in her uterus.

22:51.730 --> 22:53.505
She can't deliver like that.
So what happens now?

22:53.530 --> 22:55.019
We need to move her upstairs.

22:55.044 --> 22:56.922
No, you do it here.

22:56.947 --> 22:59.044
Well, then I need you to get
me something out of the Pyxis.

22:59.069 --> 23:00.598
A medication, Terbutaline.

23:00.623 --> 23:03.257
I'll get it.

23:03.281 --> 23:05.021
Just look at me. Look at me. Breathe.

23:05.046 --> 23:07.346
- Good.
- Are you gonna turn the baby?

23:07.371 --> 23:09.014
Water hasn't broken yet.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.839
And the Terbutaline
should soften her uterus.

23:10.863 --> 23:11.802
She's in labor.

23:11.827 --> 23:13.827
We could cause a placental
abruption or a prolapse.

23:13.852 --> 23:16.270
Well, he's not giving
me any other choice.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.403
All right, breathe, breathe, breathe...
hey, look at me.

23:20.428 --> 23:22.348
Breathe.

23:22.373 --> 23:23.672
That's good.

23:37.947 --> 23:40.814
106 over 66. Heart rate's 122.

23:40.839 --> 23:42.906
All right, let's give 10 of Lasix

23:42.931 --> 23:45.340
and 12.5 of metoprolol on an IV drip.

23:45.365 --> 23:46.760
- All right.
- What is it?

23:46.785 --> 23:49.216
I don't know, Dad. But
something's not right.

23:49.241 --> 23:50.681
This is your fault!

23:50.706 --> 23:53.183
I should have never let you convince me

23:53.208 --> 23:55.475
to come here in the first place.

23:55.500 --> 23:56.770
If...

23:57.650 --> 24:00.150
Dad?

24:00.175 --> 24:02.151
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

24:02.449 --> 24:04.570
He's not breathing. Start bagging.

24:04.937 --> 24:06.837
No pulse. He's in V-tach.

24:07.115 --> 24:09.549
I need the paddles! Sharon,
we need you in here!

24:09.574 --> 24:11.073
He's in cardiac arrest!

24:11.098 --> 24:13.505
.We need the paddles. .Ok.

24:16.862 --> 24:18.500
Charge to 200.

24:19.483 --> 24:20.878
Charged.

24:20.903 --> 24:22.838
- Clear.
- Clear.

24:26.220 --> 24:28.719
No pulse. Milligram of epi.

24:35.861 --> 24:37.707
Epi's in.

24:39.765 --> 24:41.356
All right, I've got a pulse.

24:41.811 --> 24:43.525
He's back in sinus rhythm.

24:43.893 --> 24:46.570
Dad, Dad? Can you hear me?

24:48.250 --> 24:51.809
All right. I want to do an echo.

24:52.405 --> 24:54.129
We need to figure out what's going on.

24:54.226 --> 24:55.746
Got you.

25:01.683 --> 25:04.224
Okay, okay.

25:06.494 --> 25:09.224
Okay, okay. Okay, okay.

25:09.545 --> 25:11.262
All right.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.881
Hang in there, Joshua. Okay?

25:15.728 --> 25:17.862
Ethan, I still can't get
this fever under control.

25:17.887 --> 25:19.004
His BP's in the tank.

25:19.029 --> 25:20.638
He just seized. Almost
aspirated himself.

25:20.663 --> 25:21.996
Sounds like he's in septic shock.

25:22.021 --> 25:22.911
He needs more volume and pressors

25:22.936 --> 25:24.004
to get his pressure up.

25:24.029 --> 25:25.735
You're gonna need to do a
central line right away.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.443
- I've never done one.
- It'll be okay.

25:27.468 --> 25:28.487
I'll walk you through it.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.405
Okay.

25:31.665 --> 25:33.765
That man needs to be moved upstairs.

25:33.790 --> 25:36.310
He just had a heart attack.
No. No, no, no, no!

25:36.334 --> 25:38.435
Not after what happened last time!

25:38.460 --> 25:40.726
If he dies, they're going
to hold you responsible.

25:40.751 --> 25:42.130
I didn't do anything to hurt him!

25:42.155 --> 25:44.069
It'll be the same as if you had.

25:44.094 --> 25:47.301
Look, David, I know you didn't
want any of this to happen,

25:47.326 --> 25:49.927
and it's not too late to walk it back.

25:49.952 --> 25:52.085
They were taking your child away.

25:52.110 --> 25:54.511
That's something anyone can understand.

25:54.536 --> 25:56.369
Please let these people go.

25:56.394 --> 25:58.227
No, no! Because then I go to prison

25:58.252 --> 26:00.551
and then my kid is just gone forever!

26:03.186 --> 26:04.768
Lily? Lily?

26:04.793 --> 26:06.593
- She's hypotensive.
- What's that?

26:06.618 --> 26:08.118
Her blood pressure's dropping.

26:08.143 --> 26:09.599
She must be bleeding from somewhere.

26:09.624 --> 26:11.430
- We are losing the baby.
- Fix it!

26:11.455 --> 26:12.458
We need to do a c-section now

26:12.483 --> 26:14.145
or you're going to lose them both.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.012
Well, if either of them
die, I'm gonna kill you.

26:16.037 --> 26:17.577
Hey!

26:19.056 --> 26:20.247
Fix it!

26:21.577 --> 26:23.006
Now!

26:27.566 --> 26:29.630
He's got a hole in his heart,

26:30.033 --> 26:32.301
between the left and right atria.

26:33.631 --> 26:35.298
He's in heart failure

26:35.323 --> 26:38.290
- Can you repair it?
- Not here.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.637
I need to get him upstairs.

26:40.662 --> 26:43.405
No, don't do that. Don't let me die.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.229
No, Dad. I won't, Dad.

26:45.811 --> 26:48.482
- Dr. Rhodes?
- Lily needs your help.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.973
I'm not leaving my father.

26:49.998 --> 26:53.099
Connor, I think her uterus ruptured.

26:53.124 --> 26:54.250
She needs immediate surgery

26:54.275 --> 26:55.968
before she and the baby bleed to death.

26:55.993 --> 26:57.883
I will do the surgery

26:58.486 --> 27:01.621
if you agree to transfer
my father upstairs.

27:02.069 --> 27:03.869
- No, you fix him here.
- I can't!

27:03.894 --> 27:07.253
He needs an operating room
with a bypass machine!

27:07.278 --> 27:11.839
Operate on Lily or I will
kill you right here.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.762
You want to kill the only
person who can save her?

27:16.787 --> 27:18.679
I will transfer his father.

27:18.704 --> 27:22.683
And I give you my word,
I will not let SWAT in.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.729
Please, David, Lily and the
baby are losing valuable time.

27:27.432 --> 27:28.815
David.

27:29.794 --> 27:31.110
Okay.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.368
Go.

27:44.391 --> 27:45.665
All right.

27:46.251 --> 27:48.586
Bring whatever blood we
have to the hybrid OR.

27:48.611 --> 27:52.089
Prep her belly, scrub in.
I'm gonna need your help.

27:54.915 --> 27:58.637
Daniel, I... I... I'm... I'm
bringing another patient out.

27:58.662 --> 28:01.700
Uh, but it's getting out of hand in here

28:01.725 --> 28:04.727
and I need you to keep the SWAT back.

28:07.879 --> 28:09.695
What's the status on the target?

28:09.720 --> 28:11.524
I haa clean shot yet. o get

28:12.742 --> 28:15.495
Uh, can you contact them?
TOC, TOC, Commander.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.075
I want that Bearcat G3 prepped
and ready for dynamic entry.

28:18.100 --> 28:19.513
- Over?
- <i>Copy that.</i>

28:19.538 --> 28:20.685
- Yeah?
- Sorry, Captain.

28:20.710 --> 28:22.215
Just out of, uh, out of curiosity,

28:22.240 --> 28:24.574
what is a... a Bearcat? A G3?

28:24.599 --> 28:26.864
- That's an armored vehicle.
- Kid's already unhinged.

28:26.889 --> 28:27.880
We don't want to do
anything to make him think

28:27.905 --> 28:29.169
he's got to shoot his way out of there.

28:29.194 --> 28:31.232
Miss Goodwin's doing a pretty good job.

28:31.257 --> 28:32.950
We already got one hostage
out, bringing another.

28:32.975 --> 28:34.294
Don't we want to give
her some more time?

28:34.319 --> 28:35.927
That kid is a ticking time bomb.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.510
We cannot wait for him to just go off.

28:42.563 --> 28:44.032
Okay, I'm ready.

28:44.058 --> 28:46.740
Insert the needle at a 45 degree angle,

28:46.765 --> 28:49.270
and then aim the needle
toward your index finger.

28:49.364 --> 28:51.981
Josh's vein is right under the clavicle.

28:56.416 --> 28:58.216
Okay, I'm doing it.

28:58.241 --> 29:01.116
Withdraw from the syringe
until you get blood.

29:01.884 --> 29:03.451
There's no blood. I'm just getting air.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.605
It's okay. Just pull
back ever so slightly.

29:06.630 --> 29:09.081
Change your angle and try again.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.720
Okay. Okay, I got it.

29:16.745 --> 29:18.550
Good. Now feed the wire in.

29:18.575 --> 29:21.232
Okay, okay.

29:23.788 --> 29:24.865
His sats are dropping.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.544
April, you need to
finish the line quickly

29:26.569 --> 29:28.225
and then insert a chest tube.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.810
A chest tube? Ethan, no.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.145
That air you got?

29:31.209 --> 29:33.022
That was his lung collapsing.

29:33.470 --> 29:35.692
He needs a chest tube to breathe.

29:46.905 --> 29:48.171
Daniel?

29:48.251 --> 29:49.685
We're here, Sharon.

29:49.864 --> 29:51.045
I've got a gun on me.

29:51.070 --> 29:54.211
So if anyone charges through
when we open this door...

29:54.236 --> 29:56.589
No one's gonna do that. I promise you.

29:56.614 --> 29:58.507
You can open the door.

30:00.169 --> 30:02.677
He's my friend. I trust him.

30:08.454 --> 30:10.019
Give me the patient.

30:23.653 --> 30:26.521
Sats are good. Ketamine's in.

30:26.641 --> 30:28.907
- Everybody ready?
- Mm-hmm.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.789
Okay.

30:37.706 --> 30:39.423
Okay.

30:39.593 --> 30:40.859
Okay.

30:41.299 --> 30:42.884
Her uterus ruptured.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.301
Wait, what's happening?

30:44.326 --> 30:45.637
I don't know.

30:45.662 --> 30:48.029
The baby's floating in the abdomen.
Need suction.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.724
I'm in there.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.451
Mom's pressure is crashing.
O neg's running in.

31:07.476 --> 31:08.810
All right, we're losing her.

31:08.835 --> 31:11.623
Keep suction going. More laps.

31:13.602 --> 31:15.402
More!

31:15.427 --> 31:17.711
[knock on'n'r die!

31:17.815 --> 31:19.671
You hear me?

31:25.522 --> 31:26.754
Okay.

31:26.779 --> 31:29.006
Make an incision next to his nipple,

31:29.031 --> 31:32.391
about an inch and a half
over the top of the rib.

31:43.425 --> 31:45.571
- Okay.
- Now take the big clamp.

31:45.596 --> 31:47.037
Place it into the incision

31:47.062 --> 31:49.582
and push until the clamp
pops into his chest.

31:54.549 --> 31:56.235
It's not going. This isn't working.

31:56.260 --> 31:57.051
Push harder.

31:57.076 --> 31:58.942
If I hit a lung or the heart...

31:58.967 --> 32:01.378
April, trust me. Push harder.

32:11.970 --> 32:14.268
I got a rush of air.

32:17.295 --> 32:18.938
Sats are coming up.

32:18.963 --> 32:21.065
Good job.

32:22.269 --> 32:23.693
Okay.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.793
What's happening with the baby?

32:26.905 --> 32:29.700
His color's coming back.
He's stable for now.

32:29.725 --> 32:31.785
Guys, I need a little help over here.

32:32.147 --> 32:33.871
Wait, what about Lily?

32:33.896 --> 32:35.546
She's lost a lot of blood.

32:35.571 --> 32:36.937
What... what have we got left?

32:36.962 --> 32:38.409
I'm hanging my last two of FFP.

32:38.434 --> 32:39.542
She's not stable.

32:39.567 --> 32:42.503
- All right, keep suctioning.
- Yeah.

32:42.855 --> 32:44.588
I can't see a thing.

32:47.780 --> 32:51.012
All right, the rupture extended
into the uterine artery.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.070
All right, keep suction going.

32:53.095 --> 32:54.849
She's bottoming out, Connor.

32:54.874 --> 32:57.143
You said you could stop the bleeding!

32:57.552 --> 33:00.647
We had a deal, all right?
Your father for Lily!

33:00.672 --> 33:02.023
All right, hold on. Hold on.

33:02.048 --> 33:03.399
I think I got it.

33:03.424 --> 33:04.693
Got it!

33:05.043 --> 33:07.111
Give me an 0 prolene on a needle.

33:07.339 --> 33:09.155
Pressure's rising.

33:09.804 --> 33:11.714
Bleeding's under control.

33:12.203 --> 33:14.828
All right, let's finish this

33:14.853 --> 33:17.539
and then we'll close the uterus.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.742
See? Lily's okay.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.380
They stopped the bleeding and...
and your baby's here.

33:25.405 --> 33:28.717
You can still have a meaningful
life with him, David.

33:29.021 --> 33:31.949
Please put the gun down.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.597
I promise to help make sure

33:34.622 --> 33:37.226
this baby stays a part of your life.

33:37.811 --> 33:39.328
No.

33:40.948 --> 33:44.148
I'm taking Lily and my baby and
we're getting out of here.

33:53.242 --> 33:54.558
My baby?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.132
It's a healthy boy.

33:57.810 --> 34:00.644
Hey, Lily, we're gonna
go right now, all right?

34:01.144 --> 34:02.379
That's not happening.

34:02.404 --> 34:04.377
She can barely move in her condition.

34:04.402 --> 34:06.754
Stop talking.

34:09.350 --> 34:10.472
We gotta go.

34:10.496 --> 34:13.730
Lily, we gotta go right now. All right?

34:13.976 --> 34:15.722
David, no.

34:17.271 --> 34:18.904
No, listen, all we gotta do

34:18.929 --> 34:20.097
is get to the neighborhood, all right?

34:20.121 --> 34:22.335
Because I know people
who'll help us get out.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.433
I promise, it's gonna be okay.
All right?

34:24.458 --> 34:25.746
No.

34:26.618 --> 34:30.737
It's over, David. It's over.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.120
If you change your mind,

34:35.351 --> 34:37.159
when you do, call my mom.

34:37.594 --> 34:40.121
She'll tell you to get in
contact with me and the baby.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.231
David.

34:44.408 --> 34:46.378
What are you doing?

34:47.918 --> 34:49.380
Give me my son.

34:49.599 --> 34:51.549
I can't do that, David.

34:53.034 --> 34:55.085
Get back. Get back.

34:55.110 --> 34:57.555
Everyone back against the wall now.

34:59.039 --> 35:01.566
Miss Goodwin, hand him over.

35:01.591 --> 35:03.686
I said I'd help you, David,

35:03.711 --> 35:05.771
and I meant that.

35:07.071 --> 35:09.068
But I'm not giving you this baby.

35:09.213 --> 35:12.987
I'm not leaving here without my son.

35:13.890 --> 35:15.698
Sharon?

35:18.707 --> 35:20.285
You don't have a choice.

35:20.602 --> 35:23.807
No, you don't have a choice.

35:23.832 --> 35:28.795
I will kill everyone in this
hospital before I leave my son.

35:29.005 --> 35:31.714
Then you're gonna have to start with me.

35:33.181 --> 35:35.089
Give me my son.

35:36.505 --> 35:38.205
David! No!

35:40.083 --> 35:41.683
David! David!

35:41.708 --> 35:43.508
- Stay... stay with me, David.
- Move, move, move, move!

35:45.324 --> 35:46.905
Stay with me, David.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.409
- Target is down.
- Stay with me, David.

35:48.434 --> 35:50.746
- Target is down...
- Stay with me.

35:53.133 --> 35:56.489
David? Stay with me.

35:58.892 --> 36:01.869
Weapons down! Let's go! Clear the area!

36:44.434 --> 36:45.955
Susie.

36:46.971 --> 36:48.867
Do you know who did his surgery?

36:48.892 --> 36:51.335
Yes, I believe it was Dr. Bekker.

36:58.601 --> 36:59.900
You did the surgery?

36:59.925 --> 37:01.586
He had an atrial septal defect

37:01.611 --> 37:02.992
the size of the Chicago Bean.

37:03.017 --> 37:05.349
But fortunately, yes, I
was able to patch it.

37:05.819 --> 37:08.515
I saved his life, but I
suppose this is the closest

37:08.540 --> 37:10.354
you can come to saying thank you.

37:10.946 --> 37:13.566
I'll be back later to
check on my patient.

37:19.077 --> 37:21.913
Hello, Dr. Manning.

37:21.938 --> 37:24.995
Hi. I'm glad to see
you're feeling better.

37:25.121 --> 37:27.161
Just wanted to come in and check

37:27.186 --> 37:29.207
and see if you needed anything.

37:31.913 --> 37:33.670
Hi, Lily Cooper?

37:33.829 --> 37:35.640
Dr. Lang cleared the baby.

37:35.665 --> 37:38.432
I'm having a hard time finding
the adoptive mom, though.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.021
Edie Thompson, right?

37:40.046 --> 37:42.345
I saw her leave the hospital.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.626
I don't think she'll be coming back.

37:44.784 --> 37:47.516
I'll call the agency tomorrow.

37:47.745 --> 37:49.678
Have them find another couple.

37:49.766 --> 37:51.533
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

37:51.558 --> 37:53.391
Can you take him back to the nursery

37:53.416 --> 37:55.449
until we get this straightened out?

37:55.474 --> 37:57.485
Hang on a second.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.240
Lily, is there something
you want to say?

38:03.478 --> 38:05.745
Would it be okay if I hold him?

38:06.293 --> 38:09.081
- Honey.
- Just for a little bit.

38:11.265 --> 38:12.583
Of course.

38:17.286 --> 38:18.654
Hi.

38:25.377 --> 38:27.097
There you go.

38:27.567 --> 38:29.142
Sweetie.

38:34.743 --> 38:37.192
- Dad?
- Lily.

38:41.795 --> 38:44.532
But he's mine, Dad.

38:47.869 --> 38:49.661
What?

39:07.157 --> 39:08.681
Will?

39:09.667 --> 39:13.102
When everything first started,
you could've gotten out.

39:13.616 --> 39:16.129
But you came back for me.

39:16.801 --> 39:18.358
I know that.

39:19.138 --> 39:20.735
Thank you.

39:23.965 --> 39:26.466
- Agent Lee?
- Will, Dr. Manning.

39:26.772 --> 39:29.661
- Is the FBI involved?
- No, this is a CPD matter.

39:29.686 --> 39:32.079
I heard about what happened.
Are you two okay?

39:33.019 --> 39:34.666
I was worried about you.

39:36.304 --> 39:38.545
I'm all right, Ingrid. Thanks.

39:40.150 --> 39:42.384
I should get going. Good night.
