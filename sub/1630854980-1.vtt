WEBVTT

00:27.166 --> 00:30.250
Speed, spirit,

00:30.333 --> 00:35.166
and a really large fish,
the three tools of a hero!

00:35.791 --> 00:38.583
Hang on. That doesn't make any…

00:38.666 --> 00:40.750
Speed, spirit and a very large…?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.375
I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:44.666 --> 00:46.291
If I'm gonna tell this story…

00:48.750 --> 00:51.416
-I've got to catch you up on everything.

00:56.083 --> 00:59.375
So, there was
this town once, Baltese.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.291
Oh, you should have seen it.

01:01.375 --> 01:05.125
-Which I guess you are now, so, good.

01:05.708 --> 01:09.458
The sort of place
where everything felt possible

01:09.958 --> 01:11.875
or even magical,

01:11.958 --> 01:14.416
like that lady
making the fountain go nuts.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.375
Check this out!

01:15.458 --> 01:20.416
Or these kids,
doing some sophisticated, magical…

01:21.833 --> 01:23.291
Inappropriate!

01:23.375 --> 01:27.833
Anyway,
times changed, like times do.

01:27.916 --> 01:31.125
And let me tell you, it wasn't good.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.791
There was the Great Foreign War,
and after that,

01:34.875 --> 01:38.916
people in Baltese just stopped believing.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.666
-Nothing felt possible or magical,

01:44.750 --> 01:47.458
and then the clouds rolled in.

01:47.541 --> 01:52.208
Strange clouds that never break
or budge or snow.

01:52.791 --> 01:58.583
The town's been stuck,
but things are about to get unstuck.

01:58.666 --> 02:02.916
I mean, otherwise, why would I tell
this story? That'd be pretty boring.

02:06.416 --> 02:10.791
Peter is an orphan
being raised by an old soldier.

02:11.541 --> 02:15.750
The soldier knows about fighting
and hardship and danger,

02:15.833 --> 02:18.333
so he's training the boy
for that kind of life.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.958
But the boy knows there must be more.

02:22.666 --> 02:25.583
Peter, other children have families,

02:25.666 --> 02:28.083
but as orphan, you have a rare privilege.

02:28.166 --> 02:31.416
You can devote yourself to soldier's life.

02:32.416 --> 02:33.291
Attention.

02:34.666 --> 02:36.208
Here is coin for today.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.083
Get our fish and bread now

02:40.166 --> 02:41.833
before you begin your marching.

02:42.333 --> 02:46.625
Older bread the better,
bread to make your teeth… strong,

02:46.708 --> 02:49.958
and small fish
so you are accustomed to hunger.

02:50.625 --> 02:52.750
-For what are we?
-We're soldiers, sir.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.375
-And what is this?
-The world.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.958
And what is the world?

02:59.208 --> 03:00.041
Hard.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.541
-Good morning, Mrs. Taylor.
-Good morning, Peter.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.541
Hmm.

03:34.541 --> 03:36.750
Are you going to the opera tonight, madam?

03:36.833 --> 03:40.416
Certainly. The only thing
I enjoy in this town.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.583
Good morning.

03:41.666 --> 03:45.000
Ah, Peter, I saved you
a beautiful piece today

03:45.083 --> 03:47.000
that you can't refuse.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.500
Come on, you know Vilna.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.458
I know. I know.

03:52.541 --> 03:54.625
Old bread and small fish.

03:57.083 --> 03:59.041
-Careful!

03:59.125 --> 04:00.291
No!

04:00.875 --> 04:04.000
Hey, Peter. Here's
the most disappointing fish for you.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.833
Oh no, no, no, no!

04:09.833 --> 04:12.166
-Mind yourself.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.416
What?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.666
"The most profound and difficult questions

04:31.750 --> 04:36.416
that could possibly be posed
by the human heart or mind

04:36.500 --> 04:39.250
will be answered
for the price of one coin."

04:42.583 --> 04:43.875
One coin.

04:52.583 --> 04:53.750
I have to know.

05:05.666 --> 05:06.666
Whoa.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.791
Your Guardian Vilna Lutz will be angry
if you return without dinner.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.666
Where'd you come from?
How do you know that?

05:20.750 --> 05:22.833
But you must ask yourself,

05:22.916 --> 05:27.166
one day without food
or the rest of your life without knowing?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.875
Mm.

05:58.916 --> 05:59.833
She lives.

05:59.916 --> 06:00.833
What?

06:09.041 --> 06:12.041
-How do you--?
-One coin, one question.

06:12.750 --> 06:13.666
Careful.

06:23.208 --> 06:27.750
Well, my family died in the war when I was
three years old. There was a battle--

06:27.833 --> 06:29.083
There was a battle.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.875
Vilna Lutz rescued you,
and he's raising you to be a soldier.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.416
-What?
-I know.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.625
When my father died, my mother--

06:36.708 --> 06:39.666
She was expecting a child. I also know.

06:39.750 --> 06:42.041
Sergeant Lutz told me
that during the birth,

06:42.125 --> 06:44.458
both she and the baby died, but--

06:44.541 --> 06:45.458
But you remember?

06:45.541 --> 06:48.958
I held her. I know I did.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.083
Your sister?

06:50.708 --> 06:51.833
My sister.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.791
She was so small and she was--

06:54.875 --> 06:56.916
Alive. Yes.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.875
-Why did Vilna Lutz tell me--?
-No.

06:58.958 --> 07:03.000
You will only get one question,
so be careful.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.375
Will I ever see her--?

07:04.458 --> 07:07.208
Stop! Stop and think for a moment.

07:07.791 --> 07:10.250
Think of the right question, Peter.

07:13.625 --> 07:15.000
How do I find her?

07:15.083 --> 07:18.125
Yes, good. Very good.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.333
And the answer is…

07:21.541 --> 07:23.375
follow the elephant.

07:25.541 --> 07:28.083
-You're having fun with me.
-You have your answer.

07:28.166 --> 07:31.583
"Follow the elephant?"
I gave you our one coin for today.

07:31.666 --> 07:34.416
You made a choice. You asked a question.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.041
And you cheated me.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.583
Follow the elephant and you'll find her.

07:38.666 --> 07:41.083
But there aren't any elephants here!

07:41.166 --> 07:42.708
Just as you say.

07:55.916 --> 07:59.041
We have no dinner tonight
because of Fortune Teller?

07:59.125 --> 08:03.083
Yes, sir, but she knew
so much about me! About you! I--

08:03.166 --> 08:06.708
How could she know about me?
I do not even know about me.

08:06.791 --> 08:09.250
She said that my sister lives

08:09.333 --> 08:11.250
and to follow an elephant.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.833
An elephant? Your sister?

08:12.916 --> 08:17.000
I know, sir. You've told me
all these years that my sister--

08:17.083 --> 08:19.000
Not again with this.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.458
Your poor mother, your sister.

08:23.541 --> 08:24.750
Both of them died.

08:25.875 --> 08:29.541
I saved you,
which was all that I could do!

08:30.125 --> 08:31.000
But I…

08:31.833 --> 08:33.916
Top shelf.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.250
Kitchen cabinet.

08:44.958 --> 08:48.000
A storybook? Who is Romain De Smedt--?

08:48.083 --> 08:51.291
Gimme, gimme, gimme!
Romain De Smedt drive me crazy.

08:52.541 --> 08:55.125
Young soldier I served with, good boy.

08:55.833 --> 09:00.166
But he read this book at night
which remind him of home,

09:00.250 --> 09:01.958
of mother, of comfort.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.041
I had to cure him of all of this.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.375
-So I stole De Smedt's book.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.500
What?

09:07.583 --> 09:09.125
And it worked.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.458
Without this book, he turned
into the most fearsome soldier in army.

09:13.541 --> 09:15.000
Why are you telling me this?

09:15.083 --> 09:17.500
Where there is comfort,
there is innocence.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.625
Where there is innocence,

09:19.708 --> 09:23.083
there can never be soldier.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.416
Peter, today,

09:27.500 --> 09:30.875
you were told… a fairy tale.

09:33.250 --> 09:36.625
One just as false as any in this book!

09:37.458 --> 09:41.208
There are no elephants.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.375
If there were elephants…

09:44.541 --> 09:47.333
…I would spot them immediately!

09:48.708 --> 09:51.000
Ah. You hear that?

09:53.083 --> 09:54.625
Some kind of disturbance.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.041
Hand me the spyglass.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.666
It's just the cats.

09:57.750 --> 10:01.083
Spyglass. Spyglass, Peter.
Spyglass! Spyglass! Peter!

10:14.500 --> 10:15.416
Amazing.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.125
Very clever.

10:17.208 --> 10:19.875
Yeah. That is a smart strategy.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.958
If only I could find a pattern.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.541
Peter, it's time to march.

10:25.625 --> 10:28.166
Go. March, march, march.

10:39.625 --> 10:42.250
-Furry little paws.

10:42.333 --> 10:45.166
Razor-sharp talons.

10:55.750 --> 10:59.083
-Oh, what did you put in this?
-Turmeric.

10:59.166 --> 11:02.375
-Really? At dinner time?

11:07.166 --> 11:08.375
I'm on it.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.708
Excuse me? Peter?

11:17.500 --> 11:21.250
Typically, we're spared marching
during the dinner hour.

11:21.333 --> 11:22.583
Yes, sir.

11:22.666 --> 11:26.333
I have to do extra because I spent
our dinner money on a Fortune Teller.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.833
Mm. And what did they tell you?

11:30.041 --> 11:33.625
To follow an elephant…
which doesn't exist.

11:33.708 --> 11:34.541
Mm.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.250
Yes.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.291
But what if it did?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.916
Leo Matienne!

11:42.000 --> 11:45.583
My wife, she's tired of my "what ifs."

11:47.000 --> 11:49.458
The elephant will lead me to my sister.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.708
Peter! March, now!

11:55.000 --> 11:59.041
A child shouldn't live like that,
marching and marching.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.625
It's none of our business, Leo.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.541
Now, at the exact same time across town,

12:14.458 --> 12:16.208
there was a show with--

12:16.291 --> 12:18.125
No, not that guy!

12:18.208 --> 12:20.833
The opening act is a magician.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.166
Thank you so much.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.250
It's not going well.

12:27.416 --> 12:30.333
Mystery and wonderment!

12:35.916 --> 12:38.250
-Ace of diamonds!
-Nope.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.250
The Hoops of Delirium!

12:50.500 --> 12:53.541
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:54.416 --> 12:56.125
Oh.

13:02.791 --> 13:05.000
I have one final trick.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.750
Excellent news!

13:09.541 --> 13:11.666
I will need a volunteer.

13:12.916 --> 13:15.458
Madam, if you please.

13:19.625 --> 13:20.916
Please.

13:29.625 --> 13:30.833
Have a seat, madam.

13:38.666 --> 13:40.916
Can we just get it over with?

13:43.041 --> 13:45.791
The Magician isn't great at magic,

13:45.875 --> 13:50.125
but even if he was,
he realizes this crowd wouldn't care.

13:50.708 --> 13:52.375
And that's what does it.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.500
He decides to try a powerful spell,

13:58.125 --> 14:00.916
something to restore
and revive all of Baltese.

14:07.583 --> 14:11.916
One elegant,
invisible moment of profound change.

14:23.666 --> 14:24.541
Now!

14:37.500 --> 14:40.458
Like I said, he's not great at magic.

14:40.541 --> 14:41.833
Let me explain!

15:09.375 --> 15:11.041
Do you have a name?

15:23.875 --> 15:26.416
Do you have a name?

15:37.583 --> 15:39.375
What? What the…?

15:45.625 --> 15:49.583
Hey! Hey, do you know what happened to
the Fortune Teller's tent that was there?

15:49.666 --> 15:50.916
No tent there yesterday.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.833
Mm. Was a tent once.
Maybe it was just laundry.

15:54.916 --> 15:57.250
-Or a hat. I love hats.
-Great.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.166
Does anyone know where the tent is?
The Fortune Teller!

16:00.250 --> 16:02.291
-Have you seen a tent?
-…an elephant.

16:02.375 --> 16:06.291
An elephant? What? Wait, wait, wait!

16:06.375 --> 16:08.583
Did you say elephant? Where is she?

16:08.666 --> 16:10.875
They locked her up. And the Magician too.

16:10.958 --> 16:13.416
It's just as she said.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.916
Who did? What?

16:15.000 --> 16:16.458
The elephant has come.

16:16.541 --> 16:20.958
-And what that means is my sister lives!

16:21.041 --> 16:23.916
She lives! She lives, Mrs. Taylor!

16:24.000 --> 16:25.583
Oh, lovely!

16:28.333 --> 16:30.541
The elephant is here!

16:31.666 --> 16:34.291
-The elephant is here!

16:38.375 --> 16:39.750
Ha!

16:45.000 --> 16:47.500
An elephant?

16:47.583 --> 16:50.166
The elephant is here!

16:51.875 --> 16:53.583
-An elephant--
-An elephant!

16:53.666 --> 16:56.833
-Yes, an elephant! An elephant!
-An elephant!

16:56.916 --> 16:59.541
I knew it would come!

17:01.250 --> 17:03.416
-I knew it would come.
-You did?

17:03.500 --> 17:06.916
No, but I had strong
and unreasonable hopes.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.875
And sometimes that's enough.

17:10.625 --> 17:14.750
She's locked up somewhere,
but I have to get her, sir.

17:14.833 --> 17:20.125
I'll barter or sneak
or fight my way in somehow.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.208
Yes. Yes.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.333
But would you allow me to help?

17:25.416 --> 17:26.958
But… how?

17:27.041 --> 17:29.166
I'll speak to the Countess
and her advisers,

17:29.750 --> 17:34.375
and you and I will…
We'll figure it out together.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.125
Really?

17:36.708 --> 17:37.583
Really.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.500
Sergeant Lutz?

17:40.416 --> 17:41.625
Sir!

17:41.708 --> 17:43.083
Sergeant Lutz!

17:44.083 --> 17:44.958
Sir!

17:45.041 --> 17:47.958
Elephants? Fairy tales? False hope!

17:50.958 --> 17:51.791
No.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.000
What?

17:53.083 --> 17:56.250
No, sir. An elephant has arrived here!

17:56.333 --> 17:58.916
-An elephant!
-An elephant will do you no good!

17:59.000 --> 18:02.333
But it must be true, then!
My sister lives!

18:02.416 --> 18:04.000
And I remember her.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.500
Impossible! She died at birth.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.458
No! I remember.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.250
Sir,

18:17.666 --> 18:19.291
have you ever lied to me?

18:19.375 --> 18:20.583
What are you saying?

18:20.666 --> 18:25.000
I'm saying she lives and I will find her.

18:41.166 --> 18:42.000
Mm.

18:45.291 --> 18:46.166
Yes.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.375
Okay,

18:49.458 --> 18:52.000
and… open!

18:54.625 --> 18:55.958
Oh, what the…?

18:58.666 --> 19:01.833
So, liberty!

19:04.833 --> 19:07.125
That's unhelpful.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.916
-You, sir! Why did you do this to me?
-Now, please--

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
-I didn't!
-Oh, you most certainly did!

19:21.083 --> 19:23.750
-You brought me on stage!
-It was an accident.

19:23.833 --> 19:27.166
Balderdash! You purposely
crushed my leg with an elephant!

19:27.250 --> 19:29.291
No! It was… It was supposed to be…

19:31.708 --> 19:33.625
Lilies. Yeah, that's it.

19:33.708 --> 19:36.166
-A bouquet of lilies.
-Hey! What is all this?

19:36.250 --> 19:39.541
No idea! It's outrageous!
Remove it at once.

19:39.625 --> 19:42.375
Stand back, sorcerer!

19:43.083 --> 19:45.125
-I'm just an entertainer!

19:45.208 --> 19:47.000
I am not entertained.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.291
-They're only tricks.
-Assault.

19:49.375 --> 19:54.666
How could I produce an elephant on purpose
when I can't even escape from a jail cell?

19:54.750 --> 19:56.625
Look. Freedom!

19:58.625 --> 20:02.083
-Lima beans, my least favorite legume.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.750
You're behind bars where you belong.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.583
-I'm going to make sure you stay there.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.333
Chest up, shoulders back. Breathe.

20:18.916 --> 20:23.208
Direct, but polite.
Strong, but respectful.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.083
Sweaty and nauseous.

20:33.541 --> 20:36.250
The Countess, she's fair and wise,

20:36.333 --> 20:38.916
and no one can remember
the last time she laughed.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.375
-She can sing!
-Can she sing?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.250
Shh. Yes, Captain Matienne?

20:44.125 --> 20:46.500
Thank you, Countess.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.833
I've come to ask
where the elephant is kept.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.166
Who sent you to ask?

20:50.250 --> 20:52.750
Have you been approached
by a foreign power?

20:52.833 --> 20:55.791
No. As captain of the palace guards,
I need to know.

20:55.875 --> 20:59.208
The elephant is dangerous.
We don't even know where it came from.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.416
The elephant is a criminal,
it is being treated as such.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.708
A criminal? No.

21:03.791 --> 21:06.416
-This may just be the opening barrage.
-Uh, what?

21:06.500 --> 21:09.000
We must expect other beasts
to be launched at us!

21:09.083 --> 21:12.375
-Camels! Cassowaries! Crocodiles!

21:15.250 --> 21:19.583
We commanded the Magician
to disappear her! He says he's unable!

21:19.666 --> 21:23.500
-As such, we plan to destroy her!

21:23.583 --> 21:25.083
I haven't decided that.

21:25.166 --> 21:29.125
If a boy throws a rock through a window,
can you blame the rock?

21:29.208 --> 21:31.125
We're speaking of elephants.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.708
-You're speaking of murder!
-The elephant committed a crime!

21:34.791 --> 21:37.791
The elephant is guilty of nothing
except being an elephant!

21:37.875 --> 21:40.416
I'll continue to consider this
until we meet tomorrow.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.083
But let me say, Captain Matienne,

21:43.666 --> 21:46.833
I take the safety
of our town very seriously.

21:48.208 --> 21:51.625
She may need to be… gotten rid of.

21:51.708 --> 21:53.333
-Hear.
-Agreed!

21:53.416 --> 21:54.916
The only sensible solution.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.208
Quite right.

22:00.041 --> 22:02.750
Now,
Leo Matienne sees one other way

22:02.833 --> 22:04.208
to keep the elephant alive.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.333
The King.

22:09.125 --> 22:12.250
Ah.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.541
He knows two things…

22:14.625 --> 22:18.708
-Mm. Huh?
-…one, The King has never been to Baltese.

22:18.791 --> 22:24.208
…over the palace wall,
landing safely in the moat.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.416
That's impossible! I love it!

22:27.500 --> 22:30.541
Two, The King likes to be entertained.

22:30.625 --> 22:33.041
-Only to be entertained…

22:33.750 --> 22:35.791
-…and never to not be entertained.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.625
I love you, sir!

22:37.708 --> 22:40.000
Hey, who wants a nougat? You like nougat?

22:40.083 --> 22:43.916
And a doctor. And then they'll go again.
Fantastic stuff.

22:46.500 --> 22:51.000
"An elephant came through a ceiling
and hit an old lady."

22:51.083 --> 22:54.041
Are you kidding? Let's go!

22:57.666 --> 22:58.500
The King!

22:59.083 --> 23:01.083
His Majesty wants…

23:01.708 --> 23:02.708
…to see the elephant!

23:02.791 --> 23:04.458
-The… The King?
-Coming here?

23:04.541 --> 23:06.875
-To see the elephant?
-Extraordinary!

23:06.958 --> 23:09.916
-We must make preparations!
-Etcetera!

23:38.916 --> 23:42.416
-Peter, what are you doing?
-Mr. Matienne?

23:42.500 --> 23:44.291
I was going to come get you.

23:44.375 --> 23:46.333
I said I'd help you see the elephant.

23:46.416 --> 23:49.041
Oh, uh, I guess I just…

23:50.291 --> 23:52.458
I… I'm just not used to that.

23:53.458 --> 23:54.291
Help.

23:55.625 --> 23:56.500
Come on.

24:00.625 --> 24:01.750
Whoa.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.583
Wow! You work here?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.250
-That's for the elephant?
-Mm.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.291
Captain Matienne, is everything ready?

24:17.250 --> 24:20.000
Yes, yes!

24:20.541 --> 24:23.125
That's right! I'm The King!

24:24.291 --> 24:25.583
Ooh!

24:25.666 --> 24:28.750
Hey, everybody's here!

24:28.833 --> 24:30.291
There's snacks!

24:30.375 --> 24:33.625
Oh, this is the best, right?

24:34.541 --> 24:38.791
I know! I know!
I wish I'd been there.

24:38.875 --> 24:39.750
Oh!

24:41.041 --> 24:43.625
Psst. Hey, it's her.

24:43.708 --> 24:46.125
-Hear, hear.

24:47.666 --> 24:51.083
And now, the elephant.

25:06.291 --> 25:09.083
Ha!

25:19.125 --> 25:20.291
You're here!

25:20.375 --> 25:22.041
-Wow!
-Ooh!

25:22.125 --> 25:23.541
My word!

25:28.958 --> 25:31.083
The sheer dimension of her!

25:33.000 --> 25:35.416
Wow. Would you look at that.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.375
I must admit,
she is a magnificent creature.

25:39.458 --> 25:40.541
She certainly is.

25:44.333 --> 25:47.125
-She seems agitated.

25:47.750 --> 25:48.916
Something's not right.

25:55.083 --> 25:56.375
Her eye.

26:01.208 --> 26:03.791
-Can those chains hold her?

26:12.041 --> 26:13.000
Protect them!

26:18.958 --> 26:21.500
Shoot it! Shoot it!

26:23.416 --> 26:25.250
No! No!

26:26.083 --> 26:27.166
No!

26:27.250 --> 26:29.416
Rifles down! Peter.

26:50.666 --> 26:53.291
-Peter!
-I'm okay. I'm okay.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.083
It's okay.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.291
Come.

27:11.875 --> 27:15.708
It's okay. It's okay.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.666
Hey.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.958
-You did it!
-Oh my God!

28:35.916 --> 28:36.875
Young man.

28:36.958 --> 28:38.916
Peter, ma'am.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.958
Peter, I'm grateful.

28:41.541 --> 28:44.208
I'd like you to stay at the palace
and tend to my elephant.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.500
The elephant is staying here?

28:51.166 --> 28:52.833
No, thank you, ma'am.

28:52.916 --> 28:56.625
-Oh.
-The kid's got pluck. I love it!

28:56.708 --> 29:01.166
I need the elephant to lead me
to my lost sister. It is my destiny.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.000
"Destiny."

29:05.208 --> 29:07.541
I must ask you to give her to me.

29:07.625 --> 29:11.250
The elephant is very dangerous, Peter.
That's impossible.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.625
I happen to like impossible things.

29:15.291 --> 29:19.916
Hey, what if Peter
does three impossible things

29:20.000 --> 29:21.291
in exchange for one?

29:21.375 --> 29:23.000
We're here for three days.

29:23.083 --> 29:26.083
Each day, I'll pick something
impossible for the kid to do,

29:26.166 --> 29:30.375
and if he does all three, thus proving
his valor, strength, blah blah blah,

29:30.458 --> 29:32.375
he gets the elephant.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.500
If not, I'll take it back with me.

29:34.583 --> 29:36.625
Well, I'm not sure--

29:36.708 --> 29:39.875
It's a deal!
You're terrific, Countess.

29:39.958 --> 29:43.583
I like this place more and more,
wherever we are.

29:43.666 --> 29:48.250
Okay, the first impossible task is…

29:50.250 --> 29:51.291
a fight!

29:54.041 --> 29:55.916
-A fight?
-Sure!

29:56.000 --> 29:57.958
Who doesn't like a fight?

29:58.041 --> 30:00.583
And an impossible fight
is the best kind, right?

30:00.666 --> 30:03.583
-Stands to reason, sir.
-The kid's up for it! I told you.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.958
Right? He's got some idea
about the elephant.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.708
-And destiny and…
-Uh…

30:07.791 --> 30:12.916
I love it! Okay, tomorrow, noon,
the kid fights my toughest soldier.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.500
-Oh no.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.500
-Pistols or sabers?
-Um--

30:16.583 --> 30:20.083
Sabers it is! I love this kid!
Give him my saber, Henri.

30:20.583 --> 30:21.750
It's all yours.

30:23.125 --> 30:26.625
Unless you get killed, in which case,
you know, I'll take it back.

30:26.708 --> 30:29.541
Peter, has any of your training
included sabers?

30:29.625 --> 30:32.583
-No, sir. Broomsticks a bit.
-Mm…

30:33.166 --> 30:36.166
Meet me at the store, if you like.
I'll try to teach you.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.875
Tomorrow, at noon.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.333
Coup d'arrêt!

30:47.250 --> 30:48.375
Dérobement!

30:49.000 --> 30:49.875
Yes!

30:50.750 --> 30:51.875
En garde!

30:53.666 --> 30:56.250
-Lunge!

30:56.958 --> 30:57.958
Mm-hmm.

30:58.791 --> 30:59.916
Counter-parry!

31:04.458 --> 31:06.416
Yes!

31:07.708 --> 31:09.416
-I'm getting better.
-Absolutely.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.583
Oh, madness. How can the boy win?

31:12.083 --> 31:13.083
What if he does?

31:13.166 --> 31:14.583
What if?

31:14.666 --> 31:17.291
Your "what ifs" will be
the end of us, Leo Matienne.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.958
I beg your pardon, ma'am. But how can
two small words be so dangerous?

31:23.041 --> 31:25.583
In Leo Matienne's hands is how.

31:25.666 --> 31:29.541
What if we put all our savings
into raising pygmy goats?

31:29.625 --> 31:31.500
A perfect pet.

31:31.583 --> 31:34.833
If they could've been trained
not to eat floors and walls.

31:34.916 --> 31:38.208
What if we import rare goods
from the Far East?

31:38.291 --> 31:39.166
Would've worked.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.875
If the entire shipment
had not been eaten by pygmy goats.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.333
They didn't eat the silks.

31:43.416 --> 31:45.250
Ah-ha! Yes, the silk.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.125
You see this roll of silk?

31:47.208 --> 31:49.208
My husband wanted to use it
to kill himself.

31:49.291 --> 31:52.791
It's called a parachute,
and there is evidence it can work.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.583
-Has it ever worked?
-No.

31:54.666 --> 31:57.500
Actually, the results have been
quite grisly. That's true.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.125
But what if I had been the first?

32:05.041 --> 32:07.375
I'm going to practice on the mannequins.

32:12.666 --> 32:14.291
A good boy.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.625
Whoa! Whoa!

32:19.666 --> 32:20.833
Tireless and kind.

32:21.333 --> 32:23.750
-Leo…
-But with no one to love him.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.250
Don't say it.

32:26.333 --> 32:29.875
And the two of us downstairs, all alone.

32:29.958 --> 32:33.541
No, we've tried and failed.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.916
God does not intend for us
to have children, Leo Matienne.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.458
And who are we to say what God intends?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.125
Please.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.333
My heart has been broken too many times.

32:43.416 --> 32:45.500
It cannot bear your foolish questions.

32:45.583 --> 32:50.791
But how? How will the world ever change
if we do not question it?

32:51.375 --> 32:53.291
The world cannot be changed.

32:53.375 --> 32:56.416
The world is what the world is
and forever has been.

32:58.416 --> 32:59.291
No.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.375
I won't believe that.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.708
For here is Peter, standing before us,

33:06.333 --> 33:08.750
asking us to make it something different.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.416
Lunge.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.083
Coup d'arrêt.

33:40.916 --> 33:43.166
Oh. Adele, my dear!

33:43.833 --> 33:46.833
-Are you well?
-I dreamt of an elephant, Sister.

33:46.916 --> 33:49.541
Oh, but how lovely.

33:49.625 --> 33:53.416
I find elephant dreams
particularly moving and portentous,

33:53.500 --> 33:58.833
although I'm forced to admit that
I myself have never dreamt of an elephant.

33:58.916 --> 34:01.833
It felt like the elephant
came to take me somewhere.

34:01.916 --> 34:06.958
Oh, but you belong right here,
dear child, where you're safe.

34:07.041 --> 34:10.000
Hmm. Safe from what, Sister?

34:10.541 --> 34:11.791
From the world.

34:11.875 --> 34:16.708
I went out to see the world, Adele,
and it was cruel.

34:16.791 --> 34:19.458
So I brought you home to the orphanage,

34:19.541 --> 34:21.791
far away from everything.

34:21.875 --> 34:25.791
And I named you Adele after your mother,

34:25.875 --> 34:28.333
who's in heaven now with your brother.

34:28.416 --> 34:31.666
Mm. Do you think elephants have names?

34:31.750 --> 34:34.916
Oh, yes. All creatures have names, dear.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.791
Every last one of them.

34:50.125 --> 34:52.166
The elephant also has dreams.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.958
The elephant's with her family…

35:10.958 --> 35:13.083
and she hears her name spoken.

35:17.166 --> 35:20.458
Somewhere she's known,
somewhere she's loved.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.416
She definitely doesn't belong here.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.000
It all seems impossible.

36:23.583 --> 36:24.625
Hey.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.791
-It's all right, it's okay.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.458
It's all right.

36:30.875 --> 36:33.708
We met earlier, with the water.

36:35.250 --> 36:36.083
Yeah, that was me.

36:36.666 --> 36:39.250
You may not know it yet, but…

36:39.333 --> 36:41.750
you've been brought here
to find my sister.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.125
Uh, I don't know where she is.

36:44.916 --> 36:48.458
To win you, I have to fight
The King's toughest soldier tomorrow.

36:53.458 --> 36:56.375
But I thought instead,

36:56.458 --> 36:59.916
all you have to do
is just point on this map

37:00.000 --> 37:02.708
and show me where my sister is.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.166
On… on the map.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.916
Show me on this map here where she is.

37:11.833 --> 37:12.916
-Okay?

37:13.583 --> 37:14.916
All right.

37:20.791 --> 37:23.750
Just gotta point where…

37:25.125 --> 37:27.666
Point where my sister is.

37:41.208 --> 37:44.083
Are you a magic talking elephant?

37:44.166 --> 37:46.416
Can you tell me where she is?

37:46.500 --> 37:49.791
Can you speak? Just speak. Say it.

37:50.666 --> 37:51.500
Say it.

37:52.583 --> 37:54.375
Can you say it?

37:57.666 --> 37:59.541
Hey!

38:13.208 --> 38:14.083
Well…

38:16.541 --> 38:18.458
Looks like I have to fight tomorrow.

38:18.541 --> 38:21.833
-So, I better keep practicing.

38:50.750 --> 38:51.833
Thank you.

39:10.083 --> 39:11.083
What's happening?

39:11.166 --> 39:13.583
There's a boy fighting for the elephant.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.458
It's time.

39:41.291 --> 39:42.791
She lives.

39:50.291 --> 39:51.458
Peter!

39:51.541 --> 39:55.666
Peter, posta breve then moulinet!
Remember, with the spin!

40:05.833 --> 40:08.291
And now, your opponent.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.083
Oh no.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.958
Oh, brilliant!

40:28.041 --> 40:30.500
This is Sergeant De Smedt!

40:31.208 --> 40:32.958
Huh? De Smedt?

40:35.916 --> 40:37.791
-A chase!

40:37.875 --> 40:39.916
Even better!

40:48.750 --> 40:50.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:59.125 --> 41:01.291
Oh.

41:07.541 --> 41:09.875
What do I do? Think!

41:11.458 --> 41:13.708
De Smedt, have you got the boy?

41:14.291 --> 41:15.791
De Smedt?

41:15.875 --> 41:19.833
Romain De Smedt,
young soldier I served with.

41:20.666 --> 41:22.333
-I need his book!

41:47.625 --> 41:49.083
-Oh no!

41:53.958 --> 41:55.166
Mm?

42:07.625 --> 42:08.958
Psst!

42:09.041 --> 42:11.250
I need the biggest fish you have, sir!

42:11.333 --> 42:13.041
-Peter?

42:13.125 --> 42:15.708
-What are you doing--?
-Take this as payment.

42:15.791 --> 42:16.625
Cod!

42:16.708 --> 42:20.083
Magnificent and versatile!
-Please!

42:20.166 --> 42:22.833
-Oh no!

42:23.791 --> 42:24.708
-Thanks!
-Oh!

42:26.666 --> 42:27.625
Yes!

42:38.583 --> 42:41.333
Whoa!

42:50.333 --> 42:52.000
I think I lost him.

42:52.083 --> 42:54.583
-I definitely haven't lost him!

43:10.500 --> 43:12.791
-Cod!

43:12.875 --> 43:14.666
Magnificent and versatile.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.125
Stiffen the wicks.

43:22.958 --> 43:24.708
The situation has escalated.

43:25.416 --> 43:27.291
There's a clear command structure.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.666
I must find a way
to infiltrate their ranks.

43:39.166 --> 43:40.291
There he is!

43:41.291 --> 43:43.833
-Sergeant De Smedt!

43:43.916 --> 43:45.916
I'm here, Sergeant De Smedt!

43:47.291 --> 43:50.000
-Sergeant De Smedt!

43:53.416 --> 43:54.541
De Smedt.

43:54.625 --> 43:56.500
Sergeant De Smedt, I'm here!

43:59.250 --> 44:00.416
What is this?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.500
-Oh!

44:12.291 --> 44:15.458
Peter, you are a solider!

44:15.541 --> 44:17.333
Remember our training!

44:24.291 --> 44:27.416
The book! The book! Look!
The book! The book!

44:34.875 --> 44:36.208


44:37.083 --> 44:37.916
Huh?

44:39.958 --> 44:41.500
My book.

44:43.791 --> 44:47.125
One great whoosh of magic

44:47.208 --> 44:49.916
freed the dragon from his evil spell,

44:50.000 --> 44:53.208
and everyone lived happily ever after.

44:53.916 --> 44:56.916
Well, that's all for tonight,
little carrot.

44:57.000 --> 44:59.583
Mama, please? Just one more.

45:00.416 --> 45:03.125
All right, carrot. Just a teeny.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.625
What is going on there?

45:14.041 --> 45:17.416
I've done some things.

45:18.166 --> 45:19.708
In combat, I mean.

45:20.750 --> 45:23.541
Do you believe a person can change?

45:25.041 --> 45:28.291
I just beat you
in battle, Sergeant.

45:29.208 --> 45:30.958
I think anything's possible.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.791
Yeah, Peter!

45:39.875 --> 45:42.958
-Hooray!

45:43.541 --> 45:45.750
Yay! Peter!

45:45.833 --> 45:47.750
-Yeah!
-Yay!

46:08.541 --> 46:10.583
I'm kind of amazed that worked.

46:10.666 --> 46:12.250
Me too.

46:18.583 --> 46:21.083
You've done the first impossible task.

46:21.166 --> 46:23.708
You've also lost my priceless family saber

46:23.791 --> 46:26.208
and ruined a perfectly good
killing machine.

46:26.291 --> 46:30.583
"Hello," said Mr. Pig.
"Hello," said Mr. Rooster.

46:30.666 --> 46:35.708
You're a surprisingly weird
and dangerous young man.

46:35.791 --> 46:38.208
-And I like that.
-Thank you, sir.

46:41.500 --> 46:45.750
Now, tomorrow,
for the second impossible task…

46:46.416 --> 46:49.000
Uh…

46:55.041 --> 46:56.833
Uh, you will fly!

46:56.916 --> 46:59.583
-Huh? Fly? I… But…
-Fly?

47:00.625 --> 47:03.500
-How?
-Hello? It's supposed to be impossible.

47:04.375 --> 47:07.333
The kid just beat Goliath.
You want him to bob for apples?

47:07.416 --> 47:09.666
Plus, we've had some people nearly fly.

47:09.750 --> 47:10.833
What? I…

47:10.916 --> 47:12.541
-Right? Nearly.

47:16.708 --> 47:17.875
Okay, great.

47:17.958 --> 47:20.333
Tomorrow at noon,
we'll all meet in the square

47:20.416 --> 47:23.500
and watch the kid fly or crash or both.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.083
Both could be funny.

47:25.166 --> 47:28.416
Like, like he really gets going
but then, whammo!

47:30.250 --> 47:33.166
No, of course not. No. Um…

47:33.250 --> 47:35.083
So, until then…

48:07.416 --> 48:11.958
I will get you water,
and then I will learn how to fly

48:12.041 --> 48:14.833
and then I will get you out of here.

48:14.916 --> 48:17.333
And we can find my sister.

48:17.416 --> 48:20.166
The elephant cannot
understand human speech,

48:20.250 --> 48:24.041
but she can look at a face
and recognize friendship.

48:24.125 --> 48:25.666
She doesn't feel well,

48:25.750 --> 48:29.666
but she does finally
feel something like… hope.

48:33.500 --> 48:37.041
And hope can spread
from one person to the next.

48:37.125 --> 48:41.000
-He ran off like lightning!
-I know! I saw it with my own eyes.

48:41.083 --> 48:44.333
He bestowed upon me this sword
in exchange for one cod.

48:44.416 --> 48:46.625
I can't wait to see
what he has to do next.

48:46.708 --> 48:48.708
I'm going early to get a good spot.

48:48.791 --> 48:51.666
He held up a book!
-Like an avenging librarian!

48:51.750 --> 48:55.375
-Incredible! Who knows what's next?
-It could be anything.

49:12.458 --> 49:13.833
An elephant!

49:16.875 --> 49:19.875
Sister! Sister! It's… an elephant!

49:19.958 --> 49:21.250
In the hydrangeas?

49:21.333 --> 49:22.708
In the city!

49:22.791 --> 49:26.250
An elephant has appeared
under miraculous circumstances.

49:26.833 --> 49:27.833
We must go!

49:27.916 --> 49:31.458
No, no, no, no! We do not go to the city.

49:31.541 --> 49:34.208
It is unsafe. Some harm could befall you.

49:34.291 --> 49:37.291
But… my dream. This is a sign.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.125
I do not believe in signs.

49:40.208 --> 49:41.583
Yes, you do.

49:42.333 --> 49:43.500
Yes.

49:43.583 --> 49:46.208
I do, in fact, believe in signs.

49:47.958 --> 49:48.833
Very well, dear.

49:48.916 --> 49:51.875
-Oh!

49:51.958 --> 49:56.625
Perhaps you do not understand.
My legs were crushed!

49:57.750 --> 49:59.000
By an elephant!

49:59.083 --> 50:01.583
Yes, she comes here every day.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.416
Every day.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.166
Every day.

50:06.250 --> 50:07.916
Oh, look who's back.

50:08.000 --> 50:09.166
-Traitor.

50:09.250 --> 50:12.250
-My legs were crushed!
-Go get help, boy.

50:12.333 --> 50:13.666
By an elephant!

50:13.750 --> 50:17.625
I know, your legs were crushed
by an elephant.

50:17.708 --> 50:19.500
But for the last time,

50:19.583 --> 50:22.791
I just intended a bouquet of lilies.

50:22.875 --> 50:26.250
Just admit you crushed my legs
with your tricks.

50:26.333 --> 50:30.500
It was an accident.
I intended a bouquet of lilies.

50:31.083 --> 50:32.083
Lilies!

50:34.125 --> 50:36.541
Lilies!

50:38.875 --> 50:42.125
Stop all that! Just stop!

50:57.958 --> 50:59.333
Peter…

51:00.666 --> 51:05.208
Peter. Peter, just stop.
Stop this minute!

51:05.291 --> 51:09.375
-Sir--
-Soldiers do not fly! I forbid it!

51:09.458 --> 51:10.791
-Sir, I--
-No!

51:10.875 --> 51:12.458
Now, you listen.

51:13.458 --> 51:15.458
With De Smedt, you were lucky,

51:15.541 --> 51:18.625
but this… this flying…

51:19.750 --> 51:21.708
It is impossible.

51:21.791 --> 51:24.875
I beat De Smedt, and I believe I will fly!

51:24.958 --> 51:27.916
And I believe
you will be crushed flat. Dead.

51:28.500 --> 51:31.083
Dead like your sister!

51:33.791 --> 51:35.500
Huh? Oh…

51:36.916 --> 51:38.458
-Watch me!

52:03.333 --> 52:04.916
Peter, what's wrong?

52:05.000 --> 52:07.750
I have to fly tomorrow,

52:07.833 --> 52:09.916
but I have no idea how to do that.

52:10.000 --> 52:12.500
Vilna says that I'm going to die.

52:12.583 --> 52:13.875
Like I don't know!

52:13.958 --> 52:16.208
Like I don't already know.

52:16.291 --> 52:20.041
I have to fly tomorrow. I have to.

52:23.083 --> 52:24.875
Come inside. You need to eat.

52:25.750 --> 52:26.833
And we'll talk.

52:32.375 --> 52:33.291
Eat now.

53:02.166 --> 53:03.833
What do you call this?

53:04.791 --> 53:06.000
Stew, dear.

53:34.875 --> 53:38.000
Okay, Peter,
now, about this flying business.

53:39.041 --> 53:40.708
Please, stay close, dear.

53:46.791 --> 53:47.708
-Hello, honey.

53:47.791 --> 53:49.625
As soon as you see the elephant,

53:49.708 --> 53:52.791
we're going back to the orphanage
where we're safe.

53:53.291 --> 53:55.875
-Help you with your luggage, Sister?
-Oh!

53:55.958 --> 53:58.875
-Quickly, dear. Quickly.

53:59.708 --> 54:02.916
Now you see why
we don't travel to the city, Adele.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.333
Danger at every turn.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.416
Peter.

54:25.541 --> 54:27.791
Peter, where are you?

54:34.166 --> 54:36.416
Hello? Hello?

54:36.500 --> 54:39.083
If only I'd kept the boy. The boy.

54:40.333 --> 54:42.791
-We're retreating to the garrison.

54:51.875 --> 54:52.833
Oh.

54:52.916 --> 54:54.416
Regroup at the garrison!

54:56.125 --> 54:58.875
Go! Go! Go, go!

54:58.958 --> 55:00.625
-Run!

55:01.333 --> 55:02.708
Retreat!

55:06.083 --> 55:07.333
Fall back!

55:11.041 --> 55:13.500
Hello? Hello?

55:18.041 --> 55:20.166
Please, listen.
You have to get out of here.

55:20.250 --> 55:22.208
We're retreating to the garrison.

55:22.750 --> 55:24.541
Their mother, is she--?

55:26.416 --> 55:28.916
Take the children. I'll meet you there.

55:29.000 --> 55:32.750
I'm a soldier.
I don't know how to care for a newborn.

55:32.833 --> 55:34.916
Of course. Just the boy, then.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.166
Please, I can't do it alone.

55:37.250 --> 55:39.500
All right. But you have to leave at once.

55:39.583 --> 55:43.958
I'll gather things for the baby
and meet you at the garrison. Now, go!

55:53.875 --> 55:55.708
I should have taken them both.

55:57.958 --> 55:59.666
I'm so sorry, young man.

56:00.541 --> 56:02.166
But I'll keep you safe.

56:02.250 --> 56:03.250
I'm a soldier.

56:21.041 --> 56:22.083
Peter.

56:23.500 --> 56:25.791
Oh, the boy with me.

56:34.708 --> 56:36.416
The garrison!

56:36.500 --> 56:38.125
Is there anyone left?

56:38.208 --> 56:40.083
No more survivors!

56:40.166 --> 56:43.166
It's not safe here, Sister!
The enemy is coming!

56:47.666 --> 56:50.041
If only I'd kept the boy with me.

57:07.500 --> 57:11.500
-A new day.
-Hey, everybody! Hello!

57:11.583 --> 57:13.708
A new impossible task.

57:14.375 --> 57:17.000
And the same impossible King.

57:18.375 --> 57:22.791
Great day to watch the kid fly, eh?
Not a cloud in the…

57:23.958 --> 57:25.666
Oh, strike that.

57:27.041 --> 57:28.916
It's a shame, really,

57:29.000 --> 57:31.708
because, you know, with a tan…

57:31.791 --> 57:34.208
…I become irresistible.

57:39.250 --> 57:42.791
I'm still King, right?
I didn't miss a coup or something.

57:48.791 --> 57:50.083
Does she ever laugh?

57:52.250 --> 57:53.166
Never?

57:53.833 --> 57:56.291
Like, not ever?

57:56.375 --> 57:59.083
Not since her brother died in the war.

58:04.375 --> 58:05.291
Oh dear.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Yeah!

58:24.083 --> 58:27.583
They said the elephant would be here.
Can you see her, Sister?

58:29.083 --> 58:30.541
-Ooh!

58:34.041 --> 58:36.750
-Stay close, dear.

58:38.208 --> 58:40.625
-No, stay with me! Stay with me!

58:42.958 --> 58:44.875
How's everybody doing?

58:44.958 --> 58:48.083
Yes, it's me!

58:49.083 --> 58:53.375
Okay. Let's see something impossible.
Uh, where's the kid?

58:53.458 --> 58:54.583
Up there!

59:10.333 --> 59:12.916
Well, that doesn't seem smart.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.916
-He'll be all right.
-Uh-huh. Yes, sure.

59:20.333 --> 59:21.250
Ooh.

59:32.583 --> 59:34.250
No, no, no, no, no.

59:36.583 --> 59:38.250
Whoa.

59:54.541 --> 59:56.083
Whoa!

59:56.166 --> 59:57.708
Ah!

59:58.833 --> 1:00:01.666
Ahh!

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:08.250
No!

1:00:08.333 --> 1:00:10.625
-What is it?
-The boy, he slipped.

1:00:10.708 --> 1:00:11.625
No!

1:00:13.875 --> 1:00:14.791
Hold on!

1:00:32.958 --> 1:00:35.125
-Phew.

1:00:52.333 --> 1:00:53.416
-Ugh!

1:00:54.041 --> 1:00:54.916
Humph!

1:00:56.458 --> 1:00:59.791
And now, I will fly!

1:01:01.458 --> 1:01:02.916
He's gonna jump!

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.708
This was a fantastic idea!

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.416
I will find her.

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:28.041
Now, Peter!

1:01:36.458 --> 1:01:38.291
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1:01:55.083 --> 1:01:56.875
-Peter!

1:02:04.291 --> 1:02:05.333
Wow.

1:02:08.375 --> 1:02:09.958
I knew it!

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:12.041
I knew the kid could fly!

1:02:18.208 --> 1:02:20.125
Oh! It's possible!

1:02:23.875 --> 1:02:26.500
You are flying, Peter!

1:02:26.583 --> 1:02:28.958
You are flying!

1:02:29.541 --> 1:02:32.250
What is possible?
It's possible! It's possible!

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:35.000
It's possible! Peter!

1:02:39.791 --> 1:02:41.541
He's flying!

1:02:49.333 --> 1:02:50.541
Oh!

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:54.000
Whoa!

1:02:54.833 --> 1:02:55.750
Peter!

1:03:05.125 --> 1:03:08.375
-Sorry! Excuse me!

1:03:16.708 --> 1:03:19.333
Peter!

1:03:21.958 --> 1:03:24.500
Whoa! Wonderful, Peter!

1:03:24.583 --> 1:03:25.708
Ah!

1:03:29.041 --> 1:03:31.208
Whoa!

1:03:32.041 --> 1:03:34.416
-Yay, Peter! Great job!

1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:39.416
-Peter! Peter! Peter!

1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:46.333
Yeah!

1:03:46.416 --> 1:03:48.833
-Yeah!
-Yes! Whoo!

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:52.791
All right, I flew! What's next?

1:03:52.875 --> 1:03:55.333
Well, you've done
the second impossible task,

1:03:55.416 --> 1:03:59.458
so, you are one step away
from owning an elephant!

1:04:00.750 --> 1:04:04.166
It doesn't sound great when I say it
out loud. A lot of cleaning up.

1:04:04.250 --> 1:04:06.416
-Huge. Anyway. Okay. Good.

1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:10.541
-Okay, for the third impossible task…

1:04:13.916 --> 1:04:15.750
Uh…

1:04:15.833 --> 1:04:17.166
I don't have it yet.

1:04:17.250 --> 1:04:20.625
No, I'm a spur-of-the-moment
kind of king, you know?

1:04:20.708 --> 1:04:25.041
I… I come up with things
on the fly, you know?

1:04:25.125 --> 1:04:28.541
Always winging it.

1:04:31.250 --> 1:04:34.291
It's a joke. God, it's a quip, but…

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:40.041
Aha!

1:04:40.916 --> 1:04:42.833
Nope. Nope. Sorry. Stand down, son.

1:04:42.916 --> 1:04:46.333
I just get like this when I'm about
to say something incredible.

1:04:46.416 --> 1:04:48.791
Okay, kid, you ready?

1:04:50.041 --> 1:04:51.708
For your third impossible task…

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:58.166
you will make the Countess laugh.

1:04:58.250 --> 1:04:59.458
-What?

1:04:59.541 --> 1:05:01.875
-What?

1:05:01.958 --> 1:05:02.916
Oh.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.250
They keep doing this.

1:05:04.333 --> 1:05:08.000
What part of impossible
is tripping you people up?

1:05:08.083 --> 1:05:11.708
Im, not. Poss, the middle part…
Im… Something…

1:05:11.791 --> 1:05:13.833
Okay, I have no idea, but it means

1:05:13.916 --> 1:05:15.833
"impossible!"

1:05:16.416 --> 1:05:17.791
Plus, this kid's a killer.

1:05:17.875 --> 1:05:19.833
Anyone thinks they're better
than this kid,

1:05:19.916 --> 1:05:22.583
you're next jumping off
the cathedral wearing a tent.

1:05:22.666 --> 1:05:23.666
Remember that.

1:05:23.750 --> 1:05:28.166
You should stop worrying about the kid
and figure out who'll get me an ice cream.

1:05:28.250 --> 1:05:29.625
Preferably butter pecan.

1:05:31.291 --> 1:05:33.583
Anyone? Hello?
Why are we all standing here?

1:05:35.916 --> 1:05:37.875
Oh! Adele!

1:05:40.041 --> 1:05:42.375
Oh my goodness.

1:05:45.625 --> 1:05:46.500
Hello.

1:05:48.666 --> 1:05:52.041
It's me, from the dream. Do you remember?

1:05:56.041 --> 1:05:59.416
I'm here. Can you tell me why?

1:06:03.583 --> 1:06:06.291
This one may really be impossible.

1:06:07.708 --> 1:06:11.208
I mean, she never laughs.

1:06:11.291 --> 1:06:12.833
-Not ever.

1:06:13.375 --> 1:06:16.083
Maybe they'd let me
jump off the cathedral again.

1:06:16.166 --> 1:06:17.583
I could write you a joke.

1:06:18.750 --> 1:06:19.875
Sorry?

1:06:19.958 --> 1:06:22.041
You're probably just not very funny.

1:06:23.250 --> 1:06:25.916
Right, and I'm sure you're hilarious.

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:28.625
-Ow!

1:06:29.666 --> 1:06:31.250
Ow.

1:06:31.333 --> 1:06:33.166
Very sorry, miss.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:35.875
It's unlike me
to say something so insulting.

1:06:35.958 --> 1:06:38.375
And I've never hit a person in my life.

1:06:38.458 --> 1:06:39.625
Please forgive me.

1:06:46.750 --> 1:06:49.500
-But I--
-Oh, there you are!

1:06:49.583 --> 1:06:51.000
I was looking everywhere.

1:06:51.083 --> 1:06:52.375
Are you all right?

1:06:52.458 --> 1:06:53.500
Yes, Sister.

1:06:54.125 --> 1:06:57.708
Well, now that you've seen the elephant…

1:06:59.291 --> 1:07:01.125
-Hello, madam.

1:07:04.291 --> 1:07:06.208
Did she tell you anything?

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:09.291
No.

1:07:09.375 --> 1:07:11.041
Very good, dear!

1:07:11.125 --> 1:07:12.500
Now we can go home.

1:07:12.583 --> 1:07:13.666
But, Sister--

1:07:13.750 --> 1:07:17.875
We'll get a good night's sleep,
then go back to where we belong.

1:07:46.541 --> 1:07:47.375
Hmm.

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:08.000
I get muddled sometimes, Peter,

1:08:08.083 --> 1:08:10.250
little unclear about things.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.166
I want you to know

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:15.416
I am perfectly clear

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:18.416
what I have to say right now.

1:08:24.666 --> 1:08:25.791
You are right.

1:08:26.916 --> 1:08:27.916
She was alive.

1:08:29.041 --> 1:08:32.041
The little girl was alive.

1:08:37.708 --> 1:08:39.250
I could have saved her.

1:08:39.916 --> 1:08:41.583
I left her with the nurse.

1:08:42.583 --> 1:08:47.708
We were supposed to meet at the garrison,
but there was an explosion.

1:08:48.916 --> 1:08:53.000
I… I didn't think
I could tend to you both.

1:08:53.083 --> 1:08:54.750
I'm a soldier, Peter.

1:08:55.916 --> 1:08:58.500
What do I
know about an infant?

1:09:00.166 --> 1:09:02.250
We make these decisions

1:09:03.500 --> 1:09:05.916
in war, in life.

1:09:07.541 --> 1:09:09.750
We have only a moment.

1:09:12.250 --> 1:09:14.125
I could have saved you both.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:17.833
I didn't.

1:09:19.333 --> 1:09:20.625
And I lied

1:09:21.625 --> 1:09:26.250
because I didn't want
to cause you any more pain.

1:09:27.416 --> 1:09:29.625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:09:45.791 --> 1:09:46.791
Sir…

1:09:48.791 --> 1:09:51.333
did you see her dead?

1:09:52.458 --> 1:09:53.458
My sister?

1:09:54.416 --> 1:09:55.375
No.

1:09:56.083 --> 1:09:58.166
Then anything is possible.

1:10:00.291 --> 1:10:01.125
Well…

1:10:02.208 --> 1:10:05.791
you spoke of impossible elephants…

1:10:07.875 --> 1:10:09.125
and were correct.

1:10:09.208 --> 1:10:10.041
Sir?

1:10:10.125 --> 1:10:13.208
You stood before an impossible opponent…

1:10:14.791 --> 1:10:17.875
and you were victorious.

1:10:17.958 --> 1:10:19.500
Then today…

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.916
…I saw you fly!

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.208
It's you, my boy.

1:10:26.291 --> 1:10:27.333
You.

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:30.583
You are what is possible.

1:10:33.458 --> 1:10:35.000
One more task tomorrow.

1:10:37.583 --> 1:10:40.041
Well, then, tell me a joke.

1:10:42.500 --> 1:10:46.208
A horse walked into a bar.
Um, maybe it can't walk into it.

1:10:46.291 --> 1:10:48.916
No, no! That's not funny.

1:10:50.458 --> 1:10:52.041
-No.

1:10:56.333 --> 1:10:57.708
Oh, yes.

1:10:59.541 --> 1:11:01.708
Yes!

1:11:03.625 --> 1:11:05.166
Yes, that is funny!

1:11:20.333 --> 1:11:21.333
Madam LaVaughn,

1:11:22.166 --> 1:11:23.208
I've lied to you.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:24.208
Oh!

1:11:24.291 --> 1:11:26.208
Finally, an admission.

1:11:26.291 --> 1:11:31.125
No, I didn't mean to hurt you
or make an elephant appear,

1:11:31.750 --> 1:11:34.041
but I wasn't trying
for a bouquet of lilies either.

1:11:34.125 --> 1:11:35.125
Mm.

1:11:35.208 --> 1:11:37.833
When I stood on that stage
facing all of you,

1:11:38.750 --> 1:11:40.416
your disbelief…

1:11:42.833 --> 1:11:46.666
…it… it made my heart break.

1:11:47.791 --> 1:11:50.958
Even now, you see magic right before you,

1:11:51.583 --> 1:11:53.541
things conjured from nothing.

1:11:54.750 --> 1:11:59.166
Granted, a fractured magic,
sloppy, accidental, but…

1:11:59.875 --> 1:12:01.166
magic.

1:12:01.250 --> 1:12:05.500
To which you respond, "Stop,"
as you would to some minor nuisance.

1:12:06.541 --> 1:12:08.333
What has happened here?

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:15.750
That night, I tried to cast a spell
on you and everyone else there.

1:12:15.833 --> 1:12:17.958
A spell to make you believe again,

1:12:18.041 --> 1:12:19.875
to care about magic,

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:23.250
because extraordinary things are possible.

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.291
If you believe!

1:12:26.250 --> 1:12:30.708
But I had no business
attempting such a powerful spell,

1:12:31.375 --> 1:12:33.750
because I'm not a very good magician.

1:12:35.166 --> 1:12:37.416
I tried for mystery and wonderment.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.041
It brought disaster.

1:12:48.541 --> 1:12:50.750
-I know.

1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:54.125
I know you're worried
about the Countess laughing,

1:12:54.208 --> 1:12:56.041
but I've got a great joke.

1:12:56.125 --> 1:12:58.750
And I've got it under control.
You gotta trust me.

1:13:01.375 --> 1:13:03.625
Hey!

1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:09.250
I feel like you're not taking me
seriously. I'm a dangerous man.

1:13:09.791 --> 1:13:13.708
-I beat a giant, I jumped off a building.

1:13:13.791 --> 1:13:18.166
Okay. okay. There'll be plenty of time
for messing about later.

1:13:18.250 --> 1:13:22.416
We just have to concentrate
on the final task, but…

1:13:31.375 --> 1:13:33.916
Oh, I can't wait to get you out of here.

1:13:34.458 --> 1:13:39.208
We're gonna have so much fun
and so many adventures…

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.541
…finding my sister.

1:13:44.541 --> 1:13:45.708
-Hmm.

1:14:06.750 --> 1:14:08.541
Wow!

1:14:09.875 --> 1:14:13.458
Ya!

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:22.375
Woo-hoo!

1:14:25.958 --> 1:14:27.500
Whoa!

1:15:15.416 --> 1:15:18.375
Is this your family?

1:15:18.458 --> 1:15:19.833
Peter!

1:15:22.458 --> 1:15:23.625
Peter!

1:15:23.708 --> 1:15:26.500
-Peter! Peter! Peter!

1:15:30.375 --> 1:15:31.333
Peter.

1:15:32.625 --> 1:15:33.500
Peter.

1:15:33.583 --> 1:15:35.875
Hey, wake up. It's time now.

1:15:37.458 --> 1:15:40.791
Everyone's here, Peter. The third task.

1:15:40.875 --> 1:15:43.375
Well, this should be interesting.

1:15:43.916 --> 1:15:45.333
Oh!

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:55.000
You must really miss them. I thought
you were taking me back to my family.

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:01.791
I need to get you back to yours.

1:16:01.875 --> 1:16:06.375
It's time for the third impossible task!

1:16:07.166 --> 1:16:11.333
Will the kid finally win
the elephant?

1:16:13.541 --> 1:16:15.916
Yes, I will.

1:16:19.458 --> 1:16:23.000
Now, if at any point
I hear the Countess laugh,

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:24.958
you walk away with the elephant.

1:16:31.083 --> 1:16:32.333
Proceed.

1:16:47.416 --> 1:16:50.875
So, there's a farmer and a fisherman.

1:16:50.958 --> 1:16:54.083
-They're out in a field together.
-Solid start. Classic.

1:16:54.166 --> 1:16:56.750
When they hear
a funny kind of croaking noise,

1:16:56.833 --> 1:16:59.833
they look over towards the pond
and they see a hen.

1:16:59.916 --> 1:17:02.416
The hen's got this piece of string,

1:17:02.500 --> 1:17:05.208
and she's working the string
in and out of the mouth

1:17:05.291 --> 1:17:07.125
of a frog by the pond,

1:17:07.208 --> 1:17:10.208
up and down with the string
in the frog's mouth.

1:17:10.291 --> 1:17:14.375
So, the fisherman says,
"Why do you think the hen's doing that?"

1:17:14.458 --> 1:17:16.708
The farmer turns
to the fisherman and says,

1:17:16.791 --> 1:17:20.583
"Well, sure, it's the same question
as always, isn't it?"

1:17:20.666 --> 1:17:22.541
-Huh? Huh?

1:17:22.625 --> 1:17:25.458
"Why did the chicken floss the toad?"

1:17:26.625 --> 1:17:29.916
Nailed it!
Funny stuff, Peter! Funny stuff!

1:17:38.333 --> 1:17:40.458
Oh, I get it.

1:17:40.541 --> 1:17:44.208
Why did the chicken--?
Because it sounds like…

1:17:46.708 --> 1:17:48.375
Hold on. Hold on.

1:17:48.458 --> 1:17:50.333
That's not a real laugh.

1:17:50.416 --> 1:17:54.958
If you're not gonna take this seriously,
Countess, then what's the point?

1:17:55.041 --> 1:17:56.625
Sorry, kid, you failed.

1:18:00.916 --> 1:18:02.041
Oh, Peter.

1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:05.833
No.

1:18:05.916 --> 1:18:07.750
What? No?

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:10.208
You have to let me take her,

1:18:10.291 --> 1:18:13.000
but not for me, for her.

1:18:14.166 --> 1:18:17.708
All this time, I've tried to win
the elephant to find my family,

1:18:18.416 --> 1:18:22.083
but she has a family
and she was taken from them.

1:18:22.166 --> 1:18:24.416
Peter, what about your sister?

1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:26.583
The elephant might have a sister too.

1:18:26.666 --> 1:18:28.583
Why is mine more important?

1:18:30.041 --> 1:18:32.750
I know the joke didn't work,

1:18:32.833 --> 1:18:36.875
but please, the elephant didn't ask
to be brought here.

1:18:37.541 --> 1:18:39.666
We have to send her home.

1:18:39.750 --> 1:18:42.541
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:18:44.166 --> 1:18:46.250
Man, you almost had me.

1:18:46.333 --> 1:18:47.416
But no.

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:52.416
You had one last thing to do,
and I don't see her laughing.

1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.625
Grab the elephant and we'll roll.

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:59.250
No! No! No!

1:19:05.375 --> 1:19:08.083
Okay, I know. This is impossible.

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.208
But what if it wasn't?

1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:13.541
Just think for a moment.

1:19:15.250 --> 1:19:18.208
Think of all
of the impossible things you've done,

1:19:18.291 --> 1:19:20.250
and you've probably done plenty.

1:19:21.041 --> 1:19:23.583
Have you ever gotten through
one of them alone?

1:19:23.666 --> 1:19:27.208
Of course not. That would be absurd.

1:19:27.291 --> 1:19:30.250
Peter fought and flew and defied a king,

1:19:30.333 --> 1:19:33.041
-and maybe he feels alone.

1:19:33.125 --> 1:19:34.333
But he's not.

1:19:34.416 --> 1:19:36.458
No one is. Remember that.

1:19:41.083 --> 1:19:42.291
Let's go!

1:19:50.500 --> 1:19:51.500
Oh no.

1:19:56.541 --> 1:19:58.625
I…

1:20:25.041 --> 1:20:26.958
All right, kid, you did it.

1:20:27.041 --> 1:20:29.000
What? Really?

1:20:29.083 --> 1:20:30.875
But… but it was the elephant.

1:20:30.958 --> 1:20:34.916
She's laughing, right?
That's all I really wanted.

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:40.208
Things are only impossible
till they're not.

1:20:40.875 --> 1:20:43.000
The elephant is yours, Peter.

1:20:43.083 --> 1:20:44.958
What?

1:20:45.583 --> 1:20:48.500
Glorious victory! Huzzah!

1:20:57.541 --> 1:21:01.083
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1:21:01.166 --> 1:21:03.125
Yeah!

1:21:05.208 --> 1:21:06.041
Wow.

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:15.750
We did it! We did it!

1:21:16.958 --> 1:21:22.791
Mm. Whoa, whoa!

1:21:24.416 --> 1:21:26.000
How will we get her home?

1:21:26.083 --> 1:21:27.416
A barge across the sea!

1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:28.333
A dirigible?

1:21:28.416 --> 1:21:31.208
Carried over the mountains
by larger elephants!

1:21:31.291 --> 1:21:33.458
That seemed good until I said it out loud.

1:21:35.125 --> 1:21:37.041
-The Magician!

1:21:37.125 --> 1:21:39.583
-Wake up now.

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:43.458
This boy says the elephant must go home.

1:21:43.541 --> 1:21:45.375
-You must make her disappear.

1:21:45.958 --> 1:21:48.708
You've seen what happens
when I attempt that spell.

1:21:48.791 --> 1:21:50.708
We're lucky it wasn't worse.

1:21:51.250 --> 1:21:54.333
Sir, the elephant deserves
to be with her family.

1:21:54.416 --> 1:21:58.083
Yeah, that's a lovely idea,
but look around you.

1:21:58.166 --> 1:21:59.875
My magic is all failure!

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:01.708
-Failure?
-I can't do it!

1:22:01.791 --> 1:22:03.208
Nonsense!

1:22:03.291 --> 1:22:06.708
-You brought an elephant through the roof.

1:22:06.791 --> 1:22:11.291
And don't you realize
it started something here?

1:22:11.375 --> 1:22:13.916
The very thing you wished for.

1:22:17.791 --> 1:22:21.625
Hey, magic man!
Let's send the big lady home!

1:22:23.666 --> 1:22:26.625
I believe that you can perform
the necessary magic.

1:22:27.458 --> 1:22:30.166
I believe that only you
can set things right.

1:22:53.166 --> 1:22:54.500
Sister! Sister!

1:22:55.416 --> 1:22:57.166
Sister, please.

1:22:57.250 --> 1:23:00.166
In my dream, I was meant to follow her.

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.416
I do not believe in dreams.

1:23:06.500 --> 1:23:08.125
Yes, you do.

1:23:08.208 --> 1:23:11.791
Yes, I do, in fact, believe in dreams.

1:23:11.875 --> 1:23:14.750
Oh, very well.

1:23:32.500 --> 1:23:35.333
Developments are afoot.

1:23:59.041 --> 1:24:01.958
The battle must be joined.

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:31.250
Hey, it's okay.

1:24:31.833 --> 1:24:33.333
-It's okay.

1:24:43.041 --> 1:24:45.458
I heard it was different here before.

1:24:45.958 --> 1:24:49.541
There was light,
there was life, there was hope.

1:24:50.541 --> 1:24:54.416
The perfect kind of town
to make an elephant disappear.

1:24:55.250 --> 1:24:57.208
This is my home,

1:24:58.875 --> 1:25:00.208
but it's not hers.

1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.500
It's hard to lose a friend.

1:25:15.291 --> 1:25:16.875
We have to say goodbye now.

1:25:21.458 --> 1:25:23.458
The Magician brought her here,

1:25:24.666 --> 1:25:29.083
and I believe that he can send her home!

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:34.291
Do you believe?

1:25:34.375 --> 1:25:37.708
That is how it will be accomplished.

1:25:41.833 --> 1:25:43.333
Please, sir.

1:26:35.125 --> 1:26:38.000
Belief is a great and invisible thing.

1:26:38.666 --> 1:26:40.791
It comes over us like sleep.

1:26:42.083 --> 1:26:43.791
We struggle along the edges,

1:26:43.875 --> 1:26:46.000
fighting it for reasons we cannot name…

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.625
until, as with sleep,

1:26:50.708 --> 1:26:52.083
we lose ourselves.

1:26:53.291 --> 1:26:56.666
We stop… and we are restored.

1:27:12.041 --> 1:27:14.166
The elephant is gone!

1:27:18.125 --> 1:27:20.583
I can't believe I just saw magic!

1:27:28.375 --> 1:27:31.500
-What's happening?
-Look at the clouds!

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:36.250
It's magic.

1:27:36.333 --> 1:27:38.500
-It's clearing!

1:27:39.416 --> 1:27:42.541
-What is it?
-It's sun, my darling.

1:27:43.208 --> 1:27:44.250
It's good.

1:27:44.333 --> 1:27:46.375
-It's beautiful!

1:27:49.625 --> 1:27:50.750
Sunshine!

1:27:55.875 --> 1:27:58.791
You were meant to follow her
to your destiny.

1:27:59.958 --> 1:28:01.583
This was more important.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:17.958
Come on now, Adele. Time to go home.

1:28:20.875 --> 1:28:22.625
Sir, you're outside!

1:28:22.708 --> 1:28:25.041
-Yes. Yes.

1:28:27.125 --> 1:28:28.125
Oh.

1:28:28.208 --> 1:28:29.416
Oh.

1:28:29.500 --> 1:28:30.750
The soldier?

1:28:30.833 --> 1:28:31.833
You were dead.

1:28:31.916 --> 1:28:33.333
You were dead.

1:28:37.333 --> 1:28:38.333
Do you…?

1:28:39.333 --> 1:28:40.416
Do you mean?

1:28:41.291 --> 1:28:42.916
The boy!

1:28:49.083 --> 1:28:50.208
Peter.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:56.625
This is… this is my sister.

1:29:01.958 --> 1:29:03.916
-You're--
-Well…

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:07.333
-First of all-- Let me just say--
-You're alive! And here!

1:29:07.416 --> 1:29:09.166
-And family!

1:29:11.791 --> 1:29:13.416
Come on, Peter!

1:29:13.500 --> 1:29:15.208
-Incredible!

1:29:17.291 --> 1:29:20.541
Good stuff. Good stuff.

1:29:21.208 --> 1:29:23.166
Oh.

1:29:30.166 --> 1:29:32.541
-Yeah!

1:29:32.625 --> 1:29:34.625
He found her!

1:29:37.375 --> 1:29:39.458
Ow! What was that for?

1:29:39.541 --> 1:29:41.541
No more jumping off buildings!

1:29:49.541 --> 1:29:51.291
The magic worked!

1:30:00.125 --> 1:30:02.791
I'm sorry for the harm
I've caused you, madam.

1:30:03.875 --> 1:30:05.375
I beg your forgiveness.

1:30:11.375 --> 1:30:13.583
Oh, lilies!

1:30:14.291 --> 1:30:16.833
Thank you, my friend.

1:30:27.541 --> 1:30:30.125
Just look at the place now.

1:30:30.208 --> 1:30:33.458
A town restored. Can you see?

1:30:34.916 --> 1:30:36.916
You've been visiting
for a while.

1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.625
I know, but every time I try to leave,

1:30:39.708 --> 1:30:43.041
it just seems… impossible.

1:30:43.125 --> 1:30:46.208
Just then, the magic coral woke up

1:30:46.291 --> 1:30:48.583
and chased the oysters away shouting--

1:30:48.666 --> 1:30:51.791
-"Begone, evil mollusks!"

1:30:51.875 --> 1:30:53.208
"Away!"

1:30:53.291 --> 1:30:56.208
-Ooh, that was really scary.
-Thank you.

1:30:58.333 --> 1:31:00.500
A whole family created.

1:31:01.500 --> 1:31:04.208
How do you find exotic yarn?

1:31:04.291 --> 1:31:07.875
Oh, I've got my secrets,
you know? I'm a big city lady.

1:31:07.958 --> 1:31:11.583
Tell me you didn't make the goat
more pajamas. All he does is eat them.

1:31:11.666 --> 1:31:13.583
Yes, but he likes eating pajamas.

1:31:13.666 --> 1:31:15.208
Come on, while it's hot!

1:31:28.791 --> 1:31:31.000
And as for the elephant,

1:31:31.958 --> 1:31:34.208
she lives a really long time,

1:31:34.875 --> 1:31:38.250
long enough to test
even an elephant's memory.

1:31:39.833 --> 1:31:43.750
But of course, she never forgets Peter.

1:31:43.833 --> 1:31:46.083
I mean, how could she?
