00:03.338 --> 00:05.085
MAN: My name is Luke Miller. _

00:05.086 --> 00:06.452
I claimed to be

00:06.453 --> 00:09.722
a volunteer EMT, but was exposed as a spy

00:09.723 --> 00:11.624
sent by the United States government

00:11.625 --> 00:14.425
to undermine the Islamic State.

00:15.161 --> 00:17.163
President Dalton...

00:17.164 --> 00:19.832
your air strikes bring
pain upon your people

00:19.833 --> 00:21.600
and death to your troops.

00:21.601 --> 00:23.469
Now I must pay for your policies,

00:23.470 --> 00:26.804
which only plunge America
into endless fire.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.482 --> 00:38.851
Just as you execute our warriors,

00:38.852 --> 00:41.320
we will exterminate all
so-called American aid workers

00:41.321 --> 00:43.189
within our borders.

00:43.190 --> 00:44.590
They are heathens

00:44.591 --> 00:46.892
and puppets of American intelligence

00:46.893 --> 00:49.093
and will be killed like dogs.

00:50.462 --> 00:52.965
He goes by Abu Nahar.

00:52.966 --> 00:56.268
But based on his accent
and his word choice,

00:56.269 --> 00:58.571
it appears he's the first
American in ISIS leadership.

00:58.572 --> 01:01.207
Do we have any idea who the hell he is?

01:01.208 --> 01:03.909
Our prelim analysis suggests
that he's in his 20s,

01:03.910 --> 01:07.413
a naturalized citizen, and
a fluent, if not native,

01:07.414 --> 01:08.747
Arabic speaker.

01:08.748 --> 01:10.182
ELIZABETH: An American convert...

01:10.183 --> 01:14.353
native in English and
fluent in Egyptian Arabic...

01:14.354 --> 01:17.056
that's got to be memorable.

01:17.057 --> 01:20.359
Has CIA contacted local
sources on ISIS borders?

01:20.360 --> 01:22.194
Our field agents are reaching out.

01:22.195 --> 01:23.629
JACKSON: The <i>Times</i> has dubbed

01:23.630 --> 01:25.631
this guy "Jihadi Judd,"
and the name's sticking.

01:25.632 --> 01:28.067
MAN: This video has had two million views

01:28.068 --> 01:30.169
since it's been uploaded an hour ago.

01:30.170 --> 01:33.138
By tomorrow, 50 million will
have watched an American recruit

01:33.139 --> 01:34.340
murder his countryman.

01:34.341 --> 01:35.808
Anyone on the fence about joining

01:35.809 --> 01:38.177
the Caliphate just got
a big push toward it.

01:38.178 --> 01:39.778
JACKSON: We're rushing to shut down

01:39.779 --> 01:41.780
availability of the video here.

01:41.781 --> 01:43.716
My team's handling international traffic.

01:43.717 --> 01:45.150
In the meantime, sir,

01:45.151 --> 01:49.755
I advise evacuating all
federally employed aid workers

01:49.756 --> 01:52.424
in and near ISIS territory.

01:52.425 --> 01:53.792
Do it.

01:53.793 --> 01:55.861
- (bell dings)
- (sighs)

01:55.862 --> 01:57.830
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

01:57.831 --> 01:59.098
I wish I could agree.

01:59.099 --> 02:00.933
I have the number for
Luke Miller's parents

02:00.934 --> 02:02.201
when you're ready for
condolences, ma'am.

02:02.202 --> 02:04.436
I have a P.A. working
every international search

02:04.437 --> 02:06.772
and social media platform,
burying that video so deep

02:06.773 --> 02:08.539
even Criterion Collection won't find it.

02:08.541 --> 02:12.678
Good. Nadine, coordinate
with the Baghdad Embassy

02:12.679 --> 02:16.749
and USAID to enforce the
mandatory evacuations.

02:16.750 --> 02:19.184
And line up assistance for NGO workers

02:19.185 --> 02:21.654
- heeding our exit recommendation.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:21.655 --> 02:24.256
So it's still a voluntary
evacuation for NGO's?

02:24.257 --> 02:27.126
Yes, but by the time you
get finished with it,

02:27.127 --> 02:28.360
it won't sound like one.

02:28.361 --> 02:30.596
Also, draft a message
to all state employees

02:30.597 --> 02:33.032
posted in the Middle East
in the past five years.

02:33.033 --> 02:35.935
If anyone recalls an American citizen

02:35.936 --> 02:39.772
fluent in Egyptian Arabic
who'd be in his 20s now,

02:39.773 --> 02:40.739
bring them to me.

02:40.740 --> 02:42.207
I'll have it out by the hour.

02:42.208 --> 02:43.776
Thank you.

02:43.777 --> 02:46.211
- Blake?
- Yes?

02:46.212 --> 02:47.947
(sighs): I, uh...

02:47.948 --> 02:49.448
I'm ready for that call.

02:49.449 --> 02:51.482
Yes, ma'am.

02:53.152 --> 02:55.219
(soft exhale)

02:58.390 --> 03:00.525
(phone ringing)

03:06.265 --> 03:08.299
(sniffs)

03:10.869 --> 03:13.571
Hello. Mr. and Mrs. Miller?

03:15.574 --> 03:18.610
Here's a list of the NGOs
operating around ISIS territory.

03:18.611 --> 03:20.913
Follow up personally with the
evacuation recommendation.

03:20.914 --> 03:22.448
Quickly.

03:22.449 --> 03:23.582
Of course.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I...

03:24.951 --> 03:26.819
I have to talk to Tyler Hogan?

03:26.820 --> 03:27.786
This would be

03:27.787 --> 03:29.188
Tyler "the Hammer" Hogan?

03:29.189 --> 03:32.124
He's very nice if you
get him in a good mood.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.126
How do I do that? Gift basket?

03:34.127 --> 03:36.362
Or should I just throw him
down the <i>Exorcist</i> steps?

03:36.363 --> 03:39.131
He played tennis at Princeton.

03:39.132 --> 03:40.833
Start there.

03:40.834 --> 03:42.701
Also, he's an amateur geologist.

03:42.702 --> 03:43.869
So the way to his heart

03:43.870 --> 03:45.537
is through tennis and rocks?

03:45.538 --> 03:47.139
(sighs)

03:47.140 --> 03:48.774
You might also remind him

03:48.775 --> 03:51.175
that American lives are at stake.

03:55.314 --> 03:57.549
(airplane flies by overhead) _

03:57.550 --> 03:59.251
(baby crying)

03:59.252 --> 04:01.085
(grunting, shouting)

04:10.629 --> 04:12.231
Go ahead and sew him up.

04:12.232 --> 04:14.033
3-0 polysorb.

04:14.034 --> 04:15.967
(alarm beeping)

04:18.603 --> 04:20.339
The lung collapsed.
Air's filling his chest.

04:20.339 --> 04:21.868
It's compressing the heart.

04:21.869 --> 04:22.602
Chest tube.

04:22.603 --> 04:23.395
- Stat.
- We're out.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.437
The shipment didn't come this week.

04:26.773 --> 04:27.808
Give me your pen.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.975
Now.

04:28.976 --> 04:30.409
And some iodine.

04:34.948 --> 04:36.215
(doctor grunts)

04:38.885 --> 04:41.320
(air hissing)

04:45.425 --> 04:47.393
(exhales)

04:48.528 --> 04:50.163
Okay. Now you can sew him up.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.532
MARINE: Is Dr. Adams in there?

04:52.533 --> 04:53.633
William Adams?

04:53.634 --> 04:55.168
We need you at the rendezvous point now.

04:55.169 --> 04:57.437
The evac convoy was supposed
to leave 30 minutes ago.

04:57.438 --> 04:58.939
WILL: Ah. No thanks, fellas.

04:58.940 --> 04:59.758
I've got patients.

04:59.759 --> 05:01.174
MARINE 2: Sir, we have specific orders...

05:01.175 --> 05:03.210
You're removing half the
doctors from this camp.

05:03.211 --> 05:04.277
I'm staying.

05:04.278 --> 05:05.312
What...? Oh, come on.

05:05.313 --> 05:06.279
You gotta be kidding me.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.681
Put the pen to a vacuum

05:07.682 --> 05:09.382
for 24 hours, then pull it out, okay?

05:09.383 --> 05:10.836
Let go of me!

05:10.837 --> 05:12.371
_

05:12.452 --> 05:13.453
(knocking at door)

05:13.454 --> 05:15.155
Yeah?

05:15.156 --> 05:16.723
Dr. McCord.

05:16.724 --> 05:18.024
Can I talk to you?

05:18.025 --> 05:20.127
Come in.

05:20.128 --> 05:22.129
You know, these aren't
my regular office hours,

05:22.130 --> 05:24.197
so from now on, if you
could act like everyone

05:24.198 --> 05:26.466
who just wants to come and talk
about a paper, that'd be helpful.

05:26.467 --> 05:28.034
I'm sorry.

05:28.035 --> 05:29.903
The Ministry of Defense

05:29.904 --> 05:31.404
is recalling Ivan to Moscow.

05:31.405 --> 05:32.805
Did you know about this?

05:33.573 --> 05:34.941
I heard.

05:34.942 --> 05:36.743
Is he a victim of the purge

05:36.744 --> 05:38.245
Maria Ostrov just announced?

05:38.246 --> 05:40.714
Sounds like you're worried that he is.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.850
Her first act as our
newly-elected president

05:43.851 --> 05:45.318
and she's ridding the military

05:45.319 --> 05:46.586
of what she is calling

05:46.587 --> 05:48.854
"foreign agents disseminating
Western propaganda."

05:50.824 --> 05:53.460
Tell me what you think that means.

05:53.461 --> 05:55.561
Homosexuals.

05:58.798 --> 06:00.065
Sit.

06:03.403 --> 06:04.671
Ivan is a good friend.

06:04.672 --> 06:06.873
He lives for the army, for his country.

06:06.874 --> 06:08.808
But recently, there are rumors...

06:08.809 --> 06:10.043
Are they just rumors?

06:10.044 --> 06:12.546
Ivan would never admit
this directly, of course.

06:12.547 --> 06:14.614
He hides it well, but...

06:14.615 --> 06:17.884
he has maybe let his guard
down a little in the U.S.

06:17.885 --> 06:20.453
(sighs)

06:20.454 --> 06:22.255
And you're afraid he'll
be thrown in prison

06:22.256 --> 06:23.723
because of his sexual orientation.

06:23.724 --> 06:25.725
Jailers don't punish men like Ivan.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.960
They let the other inmates
take care of that.

06:29.262 --> 06:30.430
Can his parents help?

06:30.431 --> 06:31.598
You said they're political royalty.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.867
His father would rather see his son dead

06:33.868 --> 06:35.167
than exposed as gay.

06:36.336 --> 06:37.671
You must protect him.

06:37.672 --> 06:40.407
I'm very sorry, Dmitri,

06:40.408 --> 06:43.246
but Ivan's just a student here.

06:43.247 --> 06:45.345
Oh, he doesn't have a deal
with the devil like I do.

06:45.346 --> 06:47.948
I think maybe you're
misidentifying the devil.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.916
I know this is a shameful
aspect of my country.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.084
And this is how

06:51.085 --> 06:52.285
you persuaded me to work for you,

06:52.286 --> 06:53.553
to change things like this.

06:53.554 --> 06:54.854
But what-what good is this job

06:54.855 --> 06:56.223
if I can't help save my friend?

06:56.224 --> 06:57.991
- There's a bigger picture.
- You have a home.

06:57.992 --> 06:59.392
A wife, children.

06:59.393 --> 07:00.527
I am here. Alone.

07:00.528 --> 07:01.661
Who can I talk to?

07:01.662 --> 07:02.729
Talk to me.

07:02.730 --> 07:03.730
You had me interrogated

07:03.731 --> 07:05.265
by Americans posing as FSB.

07:05.266 --> 07:06.499
Half the time, I don't know

07:06.500 --> 07:07.834
if you're helping me
or trying to kill me.

07:07.835 --> 07:09.002
You need to calm down.

07:09.003 --> 07:10.103
We have been through this.

07:10.104 --> 07:11.404
You know that I'm your ally here.

07:11.405 --> 07:12.372
Then, please,

07:12.373 --> 07:13.773
help Ivan.

07:13.774 --> 07:15.408
I can't lose the closest friend

07:15.409 --> 07:16.942
I have in this country.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.848
Let me see what I can do.

07:24.351 --> 07:26.319
We are not going to do anything.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.787
Ivan's persona non grata at the Kremlin.

07:27.788 --> 07:29.682
It's a good thing you moved
us off of recruiting him.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.890
Without Ivan's friendship,

07:30.891 --> 07:33.226
I am very worried about Dmitri's
psychological well-being.

07:33.227 --> 07:34.794
Funny. It's the thought
of Maria Ostrov's finger

07:34.795 --> 07:36.429
over the red button that
keeps me up at night.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.731
Right, exactly.

07:37.732 --> 07:39.199
That's why we should use
every resource we have

07:39.200 --> 07:40.328
to make sure that doesn't happen.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.901
Turn around this whole situation

07:41.902 --> 07:43.069
in Eastern Europe.

07:43.070 --> 07:44.471
Tell me you agree with
me on that, please.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.239
Okay, you are getting way
out of your depth, here.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.341
- You gotta back off.
- Look, if-if Dmitri snaps,

07:48.342 --> 07:49.509
we lose an asset

07:49.510 --> 07:50.610
who is poised to rise

07:50.611 --> 07:52.012
through the ranks of
the Russian military.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.847
Okay, all the more reason
not to compromise him

07:53.848 --> 07:55.782
just to try to save a
random junior officer.

07:55.783 --> 07:57.851
Look, I know we have other
agents in the Russian army.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.152
There's got to be a lever we can pull

07:59.153 --> 08:00.654
- to keep Ivan at the War College.
- Henry!

08:00.655 --> 08:03.456
I am not risking any DIA assets on this.

08:03.457 --> 08:04.491
End of discussion.

08:04.492 --> 08:05.892
Then take it out of DIA's hands.

08:05.893 --> 08:07.727
We get Ivan asylum in the U.S.

08:07.728 --> 08:09.562
Oh, great. We bring State
into DIA business.

08:09.563 --> 08:10.630
It works.

08:10.631 --> 08:12.232
To Ivan, I'm a concerned professor

08:12.233 --> 08:13.867
with the resources to help.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.603
Wow. Backing off really
is not your gift, is it?

08:16.604 --> 08:19.506
You asked me to handle Dmitri.

08:19.507 --> 08:21.340
Let me do my job.

08:24.644 --> 08:26.146
DIA's prints are nowhere.

08:26.147 --> 08:27.847
You just play

08:27.848 --> 08:29.082
the sympathetic professor card.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.382
That is it.

08:35.221 --> 08:38.357
NADINE: His name is Adam Fanning.

08:38.359 --> 08:40.226
He's the son of Judith Fanning,

08:40.227 --> 08:43.363
a State Department employee
in the Near East Bureau.

08:43.364 --> 08:45.265
Are you sure?

08:45.266 --> 08:47.934
She was stationed in Cairo for six years.

08:47.935 --> 08:49.736
Adam grew up there.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.037
And learned Arabic

08:51.038 --> 08:52.539
at the American International School.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.573
DAISY: That's right.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.208
He returned here for high school.

08:55.209 --> 08:57.711
His father died in a car accident.

08:57.712 --> 08:59.579
A few months later,
Adam converted to Islam.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.114
He went back to Egypt for college

09:01.115 --> 09:03.516
and dropped out two years
later to join ISIS.

09:03.517 --> 09:06.853
I'm guessing his mother
didn't give us any of this.

09:06.854 --> 09:09.122
No, but she certainly got the memo.

09:09.123 --> 09:10.056
Is she in today?

09:10.057 --> 09:12.024
No, she works part-time.

09:13.493 --> 09:15.962
Bring her in. Quietly.

09:15.963 --> 09:18.098
If she's colluding with her son,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.833
we can't risk spooking her.

09:19.834 --> 09:21.533
Yes, ma'am.

09:26.940 --> 09:29.408
(door closes)

09:31.244 --> 09:33.146
- Ms. Fanning.
- Yes?

09:33.147 --> 09:35.742
Nadine Tolliver, Secretary
McCord's chief of staff.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.708
- I-I think we've met before.
- Yes, of course.

09:37.709 --> 09:38.385
Yes, that's right.

09:38.386 --> 09:40.120
Thank you, guys.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.488
Can you tell me what's going on?

09:41.489 --> 09:44.858
I mean, I was told that I was
covering for a sick co-worker.

09:44.859 --> 09:47.260
Um, the secretary will fill you in.

09:47.261 --> 09:50.029
The secretary?

09:50.030 --> 09:51.831
Egyptian embassy party a few years back.

09:51.832 --> 09:54.267
That is definitely,
definitely where we met.

09:54.268 --> 09:56.436
Ah. Yes.

09:56.437 --> 09:58.070
This way.

09:59.606 --> 10:01.374
- (door opens)
- NADINE: Madam Secretary,

10:01.375 --> 10:02.975
this is Judith Fanning.

10:04.043 --> 10:05.278
Madam Secretary.

10:05.279 --> 10:07.313
Ms. Fanning.

10:07.314 --> 10:08.415
By now, you've realized

10:08.416 --> 10:09.916
I haven't called you in to do work.

10:09.917 --> 10:11.584
Is something wrong?

10:11.585 --> 10:13.887
I'm going to cut to the chase.

10:13.888 --> 10:16.256
Have you seen the ISIS beheading video

10:16.257 --> 10:17.624
that was released earlier today?

10:17.625 --> 10:19.359
No.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.760
No, I haven't looked at my computer.

10:20.761 --> 10:22.061
Not on the news?

10:22.062 --> 10:23.296
Mm-mm.

10:23.297 --> 10:26.999
I'm sorry, is this about
my Syrian arms brief?

10:28.268 --> 10:31.837
I'm gonna need you to watch this video.

10:35.975 --> 10:37.276
Okay.

10:43.049 --> 10:44.918
President Dalton,

10:44.919 --> 10:47.253
your air strikes bring
pain upon your people

10:47.254 --> 10:48.755
and death to your troops.

10:48.756 --> 10:51.056
(man speaking Arabic)

10:58.031 --> 11:00.967
Just as you execute our warriors,

11:00.968 --> 11:04.037
we will exterminate all
so-called American aid workers

11:04.038 --> 11:06.072
within our borders.

11:06.073 --> 11:07.907
They are heathens

11:07.908 --> 11:09.943
and puppets of American intelligence

11:09.944 --> 11:11.777
and will be killed like dogs.

11:15.915 --> 11:18.685
You recognize that man's voice?

11:18.686 --> 11:20.953
(gasps)

11:35.253 --> 11:37.229
ELIZABETH: <i>He returned
to Egypt for college</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:39.496
as the Arab Spring began.

11:39.497 --> 11:41.332
He became radicalized after falling in

11:41.333 --> 11:42.499
with the Muslim Brotherhood.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.036
Does the mother have any
idea where he might be?

11:46.037 --> 11:47.872
No, they lost touch a year ago.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.107
The FBI is interrogating her right now.

11:50.108 --> 11:53.644
All of our intelligence
agencies are into it.

11:53.645 --> 11:56.046
Should we be talking about
putting his name out there?

11:56.047 --> 11:57.848
Or releasing a photo?

11:57.849 --> 11:59.850
I'd advise against it.

11:59.851 --> 12:01.919
There's a tactical advantage
to holding our cards.

12:01.920 --> 12:02.953
The safer he feels,

12:02.954 --> 12:04.555
the more likely he is to screw up.

12:04.556 --> 12:07.958
And if we I.D. him, we reveal
his affiliation with State.

12:07.959 --> 12:10.527
Which is an even bigger coup for ISIS.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.429
The first American-born

12:12.430 --> 12:14.899
ISIS leader with direct ties
to the State Department?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.600
It's hard to bounce back from that.

12:16.601 --> 12:18.569
That is not my primary concern.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.204
Well, nor mine, but it's in the equation.

12:20.205 --> 12:23.540
I don't give a crap about the
political equation, Russell!

12:23.541 --> 12:25.309
I want him to stop cutting off

12:25.310 --> 12:27.278
innocent American heads
and broadcasting it

12:27.279 --> 12:28.612
all over the world!

12:28.613 --> 12:31.348
I want this son of a
bitch either captured

12:31.349 --> 12:34.584
or killed and I don't give a damn which!

♪

12:59.221 --> 13:00.689
Thank you, guys.

13:00.690 --> 13:03.403
Madam Secretary, I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint!

13:03.404 --> 13:04.618
- Don't move!
- I bring regards

13:04.619 --> 13:06.586
from the Syrian refugees...

13:06.587 --> 13:08.188
Show me your hands!

13:08.189 --> 13:11.057
(chuckles) Nice, very... very nice,

13:11.058 --> 13:13.827
Madam Secretary; a real
woman of the people.

13:13.828 --> 13:16.797
Honestly, you couldn't have
cleaned up a little bit.

13:16.798 --> 13:18.832
AGENT: Madam, do you know this man?

13:18.833 --> 13:21.635
He's my brother.

13:21.636 --> 13:23.837
Sorry, ma'am.

13:23.838 --> 13:25.406
- We thought he was...
- A crazy person?

13:25.407 --> 13:26.740
Yeah, I know, he is.

13:26.741 --> 13:27.674
But he's harmless.

13:27.675 --> 13:30.509
Thank you, I got it from here.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.280
Good night.

13:33.281 --> 13:34.448
Don't keep Marines waiting

13:34.449 --> 13:36.716
when they are trying
to save your sorry ass.

13:36.717 --> 13:38.285
Oh, is that what they were doing?

13:38.286 --> 13:39.820
Looked more like ditching people in need.

13:39.821 --> 13:41.855
Shut up.

13:41.856 --> 13:44.090
You promised me you would
stay out of conflict zones.

13:44.091 --> 13:46.059
I said I'd try to stay out
of the conflict zones.

13:46.060 --> 13:50.730
By working in a camp right on
the border of ISIS territory?

13:50.731 --> 13:52.732
They just announced their intent

13:52.733 --> 13:54.434
to kill all American aid workers.

13:54.435 --> 13:56.392
I-I have my U.K. passport.

13:56.393 --> 13:57.938
Do you know the position
you would put me in

13:57.939 --> 13:59.172
- if you got kidnapped?
- Oh, come on.

13:59.173 --> 14:00.307
The position you'd put your government in?

14:00.308 --> 14:01.541
Come on, I am not that important.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.410
- To people looking for leverage you are.
- Oh!

14:03.411 --> 14:05.579
You are the Secretary of State's brother!

14:05.580 --> 14:07.013
Not when I started this job.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.949
HENRY: I thought I heard the dulcet tones

14:08.950 --> 14:11.218
- of the Adams siblings.
- Thank God.

14:11.219 --> 14:12.552
Look what the grunts dragged in.

14:12.553 --> 14:14.087
- Hey, brother.
- Emphasis on "dragged."

14:14.088 --> 14:16.256
- Touchy subject. - I'm surprised
she waited this long actually.

14:16.257 --> 14:17.624
- Yeah.
- You good? Come on, have some dinner.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.326
- No, no, this isn't a friendly...
- STEVIE: Uncle Will?

14:19.327 --> 14:20.727
- Hey!
- Hi!

14:20.728 --> 14:22.796
- Oh, my God!
- What are you going here?

14:22.797 --> 14:25.632
- My favorite niece.
- Oh, my God, you are too skinny.

14:25.633 --> 14:26.700
Well, look who's talking.

14:26.701 --> 14:28.735
Are-are Aunt Sophie and Annie with you?

14:28.736 --> 14:30.337
No, they're-they're in London.

14:30.338 --> 14:31.938
Well, do you have pictures of them?

14:31.939 --> 14:34.441
- I have a few.
- Come on, show them at dinner.

14:34.442 --> 14:36.710
- Come on!
- Okay.

14:36.711 --> 14:38.111
Now, if you get the knife point

14:38.112 --> 14:40.447
right behind the posterior dorsal region...

14:40.448 --> 14:41.715
You mean the wing.

14:41.716 --> 14:43.984
...you maximize the amount of meat.

14:43.985 --> 14:45.819
Let nothing go to waste.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.521
What do they feed you guys at the camps?

14:47.522 --> 14:49.256
Well, nothing like this feast.

14:49.257 --> 14:51.992
Mostly rice. Maybe some beans

14:51.993 --> 14:54.394
if the convoy hasn't been
hijacked or the roads bombed.

14:54.395 --> 14:56.220
STEVIE: Well, Jason freaks out

14:56.221 --> 14:58.365
if the pizza takes more than
half an hour to deliver.

14:58.366 --> 14:59.332
Really?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.534
They made a guarantee.

15:00.535 --> 15:01.968
I like to hold our
institutions accountable.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.404
Well, tell your mother that.

15:04.405 --> 15:05.705
Oh, don't, Will.

15:05.706 --> 15:06.907
Don't what?

15:06.908 --> 15:08.575
WILL: She doesn't want to be reminded

15:08.576 --> 15:11.745
that her boss' administration
spends exponentially more

15:11.746 --> 15:13.747
on bombing Syria than
feeding the civilians

15:13.748 --> 15:15.081
they're supposedly protecting.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.117
We haven't seen each
other in over a year.

15:17.118 --> 15:18.985
Can we try and enjoy dinner?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.020
You're right.

15:20.021 --> 15:22.789
Dinner is a luxury.

15:22.790 --> 15:24.824
The Syrians I know are so starved,

15:24.825 --> 15:26.293
they sell their refrigerators
for a few bucks

15:26.294 --> 15:27.494
just to survive the week.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.262
HENRY: I guess this would
be a bad time to ask

15:29.263 --> 15:30.597
if anybody wants some mashed potatoes.

15:30.598 --> 15:31.865
Look, I want to get rid of ISIS

15:31.866 --> 15:34.034
as much as the next guy,
but at a certain point...

15:34.035 --> 15:35.502
Really? Because I'm
actually one of the guys

15:35.503 --> 15:37.704
tasked with doing it, so trust me

15:37.705 --> 15:40.574
when I tell you that it's a
little bit more complicated

15:40.575 --> 15:42.609
than your simplistic view.

15:42.610 --> 15:43.743
- Whoa. Point, Mom.
- You can't imagine

15:43.744 --> 15:45.712
from your high perch inside the Beltway,

15:45.713 --> 15:47.480
the things I see on the ground.

15:47.481 --> 15:49.215
You wouldn't last five minutes

15:49.216 --> 15:50.850
dealing with the big picture dynamics

15:50.851 --> 15:52.552
- of my job.
- You're right.

15:52.553 --> 15:54.621
I am not a bureaucrat.
I actually help people.

15:54.622 --> 15:55.655
- You want to go there?
- Yeah.

15:55.656 --> 15:57.324
Well, here we are

15:57.325 --> 15:59.413
in your fancy Georgetown
mansion, let's go.

15:59.414 --> 16:00.781
I should've left you over there.

16:00.782 --> 16:01.432
You should have.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.949
Hey, you guys want to save
some of this for Christmas?

16:02.950 --> 16:04.669
Is this what we sound
like when we fight?

16:04.670 --> 16:06.034
- Pretty much, yeah.
- Yes.

16:08.406 --> 16:10.707
I'm sorry.

16:13.811 --> 16:15.413
You know what the problem is, right?

16:15.414 --> 16:17.281
If you tell me it's because
we're too much alike

16:17.282 --> 16:19.046
I'm gonna throw something at you.

16:19.047 --> 16:20.226
Besides that.

16:20.227 --> 16:23.562
There-there's a lot of
pressure on your relationship.

16:23.563 --> 16:25.877
You-you were young
when your parents died.

16:25.878 --> 16:27.200
It's not that!

16:27.201 --> 16:29.105
Okay.

16:29.106 --> 16:33.063
The problem is he's a
narcissistic adrenaline junkie.

16:33.843 --> 16:36.384
Did you know that he hasn't been
back to see Sophie in months.

16:37.534 --> 16:39.248
The truth is...

16:39.249 --> 16:41.483
he doesn't want to go home.

16:42.815 --> 16:44.721
I'm not the one that
needs to hear all this.

16:44.722 --> 16:47.355
Like I could ever get him to
talk to me about this stuff.

16:47.977 --> 16:49.926
Okay, why don't you
take him fly fishing?

16:49.927 --> 16:51.694
With what time?

16:51.695 --> 16:52.929
Just find it.

16:52.930 --> 16:56.132
For some reason that I will
never fully understand,

16:56.133 --> 16:58.167
that whole river thing

16:58.168 --> 17:01.437
seems to move your WASP-y souls, so...

17:01.438 --> 17:03.039
Connecting is a lot easier

17:03.040 --> 17:06.876
when you're not having
to look at each other.

17:06.877 --> 17:10.113
(both laugh)

17:10.114 --> 17:12.482
All right.

17:12.483 --> 17:13.883
I'll see if he bites.

17:13.884 --> 17:17.353
Aw, good.

17:17.354 --> 17:19.122
Oh, hey, listen.

17:19.123 --> 17:21.891
I have this very promising

17:21.892 --> 17:24.260
Russian student who's
getting recalled to Moscow

17:24.261 --> 17:25.962
by Ostrov for being gay.

17:25.963 --> 17:28.397
And this kid is so duty-bound,

17:28.398 --> 17:29.999
he'll take his fate on the chin.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.735
If he makes an asylum request,

17:32.736 --> 17:33.870
will you vouch for it?

17:33.871 --> 17:36.339
Is he afraid for his safety?

17:36.340 --> 17:38.808
- Babe, it's...
- Of course he is.

17:38.809 --> 17:41.044
And he's still willing to go back.

17:41.045 --> 17:42.412
Mm-hmm.

17:42.413 --> 17:44.981
Ostrov is losing a good
soldier for nothing.

17:44.982 --> 17:46.182
Yeah.

17:46.183 --> 17:49.485
And one brave enough to be
out in the Russian army?

17:49.486 --> 17:52.288
- Wow.
- Actually, he's not out.

17:52.289 --> 17:54.757
Well, Henry,

17:54.758 --> 17:57.093
he's gonna have to cite homosexuality

17:57.094 --> 17:59.996
as his reason for asylum.

17:59.997 --> 18:02.098
Okay, I'll have to
convince him to do that.

18:02.099 --> 18:05.068
If you do, then, yeah,
I'll do whatever I can.

18:05.069 --> 18:07.702
- (cell phone ringing)
- Oh, it's your boyfriend.

18:09.105 --> 18:11.841
That's-that's so funny.

18:11.842 --> 18:14.510
Hey, Russell, what's up?

18:14.511 --> 18:17.480
The FBI found evidence in
Judith Fanning's bank records

18:17.481 --> 18:21.451
that she provided material
support to terrorists.

18:21.452 --> 18:22.652
What?! (stammers)

18:22.653 --> 18:24.253
What kind?

18:24.254 --> 18:26.823
Her son Adam contacted
her six months ago.

18:26.824 --> 18:29.792
She admitted to sending him $8,000.

18:29.793 --> 18:32.761
Oh, come on.

18:33.954 --> 18:37.168
She's adamant the money
didn't go to ISIS.

18:37.169 --> 18:39.838
Well, the FBI report backs that.

18:39.839 --> 18:43.314
She's not ideologically
aligned with her son.

18:43.315 --> 18:45.410
Yet she lied about not talking to him.

18:45.411 --> 18:48.780
And she refuses to say what
the money was actually for.

18:48.781 --> 18:52.217
What else if not to
support the caliphate?

18:52.218 --> 18:54.386
There aren't exactly malls

18:54.387 --> 18:56.921
in the Syro-Arabian desert.

18:56.922 --> 18:58.857
Well, they were estranged.

18:58.858 --> 19:00.525
And reached out.

19:00.526 --> 19:03.361
Guilt is a powerful thing.

19:03.362 --> 19:06.765
Guilt over being a
single, working mother?

19:06.766 --> 19:08.266
Yes.

19:08.267 --> 19:11.636
But the husband's death
complicates things.

19:11.637 --> 19:13.104
How?

19:13.105 --> 19:14.572
I thought it was a car accident.

19:14.573 --> 19:17.776
I remembered the circumstances
when I reviewed her file.

19:17.777 --> 19:20.779
He lost control of the
car due to a seizure

19:20.780 --> 19:22.647
caused by Huntington's disease.

19:22.648 --> 19:25.917
He was barely 43 years old.

19:25.918 --> 19:29.120
And he'd been misdiagnosed
for almost two years.

19:29.121 --> 19:32.524
My understanding is
that she blames herself

19:32.525 --> 19:34.526
for not catching it sooner.

19:34.527 --> 19:37.462
That is a morbid detail to note.

19:37.463 --> 19:38.763
Too thorough?

19:38.764 --> 19:40.699
No.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.367
I think you might actually
be onto something.

19:44.312 --> 19:45.512
_

19:49.908 --> 19:52.343
Madam Secretary.

19:52.344 --> 19:55.280
Well, I-I-I didn't realize
you would be the closer.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.582
When my own employee lies to my face,

19:57.583 --> 19:59.416
I like to find out why.

20:04.489 --> 20:06.857
I can't help you.

20:08.256 --> 20:09.861
'Cause you want to kill my son.

20:09.862 --> 20:14.332
I want to stop him from
killing innocent people.

20:14.333 --> 20:17.302
You should, too.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.571
I want my son back.

20:19.572 --> 20:21.839
The-the way that he was.

20:23.975 --> 20:27.679
Before he became radicalized or...

20:27.680 --> 20:30.882
before you found out he
had Huntington's disease?

20:30.883 --> 20:34.552
Early onset sufferers are likely

20:34.553 --> 20:36.554
to have children who exhibit

20:36.555 --> 20:40.024
symptoms even earlier.

20:40.025 --> 20:42.860
Is that what happened to Adam?

20:46.531 --> 20:48.900
Last year, he e-mailed.

20:48.901 --> 20:51.569
He wanted to talk about
his father's symptoms.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.272
So we Skyped.

20:54.273 --> 20:56.141
And-and there he was.

20:56.142 --> 20:57.975
He was shaking like a leaf.

20:59.944 --> 21:02.614
Did he say where he was
or who he'd been with?

21:02.615 --> 21:04.481
Nothing.

21:05.850 --> 21:08.453
I told you I will be no help.

21:08.454 --> 21:09.988
Your computer records

21:09.989 --> 21:12.023
show that shortly before
you sent the money,

21:12.024 --> 21:15.260
you searched online for
information on a drug.

21:15.261 --> 21:16.728
Tetrabenazine.

21:16.729 --> 21:19.230
It's the only medicine proven

21:19.231 --> 21:22.867
to curb early onset spasms.

21:22.868 --> 21:25.969
That's what the money
was for, wasn't it?

21:29.407 --> 21:32.843
I-I know what Adam did was unforgivable.

21:34.345 --> 21:37.015
But he's still my son.

21:37.016 --> 21:38.783
Just promise me

21:38.784 --> 21:41.920
that you'll give him a chance.

21:41.921 --> 21:43.388
Promise to...

21:43.389 --> 21:46.857
(crying): that you won't kill him?

21:48.860 --> 21:51.128
I'm sorry.

21:53.215 --> 21:53.915
_

22:05.287 --> 22:06.655
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:06.656 --> 22:07.989
Call Nadine.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.431
Get her into tracking

22:09.432 --> 22:12.134
any plausible source of tetrabenazine

22:12.135 --> 22:13.468
entering ISIS territory.

22:13.469 --> 22:14.770
- Tetra...
- She'll know.

22:14.771 --> 22:16.104
Okay.

22:16.105 --> 22:19.141
And make it clear... no one
outside our inner circle

22:19.142 --> 22:20.409
knows why we're looking into it.

22:20.410 --> 22:21.610
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.412
Interpol picked up a
pair of American kids

22:23.413 --> 22:26.681
at the Frankfurt airport
headed for the Syrian front.

22:26.682 --> 22:29.051
(sighs) Jihadi Judd fans?

22:29.052 --> 22:30.652
Yeah, it's in the news now.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.821
The country's frightened.

22:32.822 --> 22:35.090
The president needs this guy
wrapped up. Yesterday.

22:35.091 --> 22:37.359
Yeah, I know, we're gonna follow
this lead as far as it'll go.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.660
Hey, did you pack my gear?

22:38.661 --> 22:41.363
Uh, yes, ma'am, the line,
leader, tippet and waders.

22:41.364 --> 22:42.998
- Great.
- You're going fishing?

22:42.999 --> 22:45.634
It's a peacekeeping mission.

22:45.635 --> 22:47.369
And I won't be long.

22:47.370 --> 22:49.637
It's called multitasking.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.242
WILL: Ah, it's just
like the good old days.

22:54.243 --> 22:57.546
You, me, elements of nature

22:57.547 --> 23:00.916
and an entire mobile
State Department office.

23:00.917 --> 23:03.652
Are you actually sore with me
for checking in at the office,

23:03.653 --> 23:05.587
or are you just looking for an excuse

23:05.588 --> 23:07.756
when you don't catch anything?

23:07.757 --> 23:11.059
I believe I hold the
extended family record

23:11.060 --> 23:13.562
for most fish caught in a single outing.

23:13.563 --> 23:16.331
ELIZABETH: Ha. I can't
wait to compare memoirs.

23:16.332 --> 23:18.966
Bring it on.

23:20.001 --> 23:22.037
Sophie and I talk, you know?

23:22.038 --> 23:24.706
Says Annie's starting to ask questions,

23:24.707 --> 23:27.042
about where you are.

23:27.043 --> 23:28.710
So what's going on?

23:28.711 --> 23:30.579
Why don't you want to go home?

23:30.580 --> 23:33.515
Now, see, I didn't think
you'd lead with that.

23:33.516 --> 23:35.884
I thought you'd start
with how my crazy desire

23:35.885 --> 23:37.986
to save the world is interfering

23:37.987 --> 23:40.122
with your crazy desire to save the world.

23:40.123 --> 23:42.424
That's just work stuff.

23:42.425 --> 23:44.292
Family's the real deal.

23:44.293 --> 23:46.061
Somebody has to do this
kind of work, Lizzie,

23:46.062 --> 23:47.762
or it doesn't get done.

23:47.763 --> 23:51.666
It's all part of a bigger plan
to make everyone's life better.

23:51.667 --> 23:55.103
Sometimes you just have to miss
show-and-tell at kindergarten.

23:55.104 --> 23:57.739
You know, you've always been really good

23:57.740 --> 23:59.407
at doing whatever you want.

23:59.408 --> 24:00.509
(chuckles)

24:00.510 --> 24:02.544
An expert at justifying it.

24:02.545 --> 24:04.546
Look who's talking.

24:04.547 --> 24:06.181
What?

24:06.182 --> 24:08.416
I gave up a station chief
position in Baghdad

24:08.417 --> 24:09.918
- Oh, well, that settles it.
- for my family.

24:09.919 --> 24:11.553
- You win.
- Hey, don't be a chump.

24:11.554 --> 24:12.853
Don't be a scorekeeper.

24:15.724 --> 24:18.226
I was never 100% about having kids

24:18.227 --> 24:19.461
'cause I knew I couldn't change.

24:19.462 --> 24:20.595
I told her that.

24:20.596 --> 24:22.697
That was the deal.

24:22.698 --> 24:24.566
That's what Sophie's not telling you.

24:24.567 --> 24:26.801
We had an agreement.

24:26.802 --> 24:29.437
Yeah, she'd stay home
with the kid, while you...

24:29.438 --> 24:31.540
Run around the world, removing
shrapnel from the stomachs

24:31.541 --> 24:33.074
of other people's kids, yeah.

24:33.075 --> 24:36.011
And there is something to be said

24:36.012 --> 24:39.014
for teaching your kids that
someone is willing to be there

24:39.015 --> 24:41.982
to take care of the people
that war leaves behind.

24:44.252 --> 24:46.655
You were doing pretty good
right up to that point.

24:46.656 --> 24:47.689
Yeah, I pushed it, didn't I?

24:47.690 --> 24:49.224
Yep.

24:49.225 --> 24:50.325
Whoa.

24:50.326 --> 24:51.293
You need a hand?

24:51.294 --> 24:53.562
No, thanks.

24:53.563 --> 24:55.362
Whoa.

24:59.668 --> 25:00.968
- (laughs)
- (Will whistles)

25:04.072 --> 25:05.974
Candice.

25:05.975 --> 25:07.409
How nice to see you again.

25:07.410 --> 25:08.677
Yes, hey.

25:08.678 --> 25:10.645
I think you know Blake Moran,

25:10.646 --> 25:12.047
assistant to the secretary.

25:12.048 --> 25:13.882
You really needed to
double-team me, Nadine?

25:13.883 --> 25:17.452
Oh, nonsense, I'm just mentoring.

25:17.453 --> 25:19.020
I've already heard.

25:19.021 --> 25:21.790
You want me for some wild
medicine chase in Syria.

25:21.791 --> 25:26.261
Meanwhile, I've just gotten
through evacuating 200 Americans

25:26.262 --> 25:29.698
from ISIS territory using
spit and chewing gum,

25:29.699 --> 25:32.167
because, as usual, I didn't have
funding for it in my budget.

25:32.168 --> 25:34.436
Well, the secretary is very grateful.

25:34.437 --> 25:38.505
For this request, she'd
like to sweeten the deal.

25:39.241 --> 25:41.109
How?

25:41.110 --> 25:43.411
Funding for your Nigerian
alfalfa initiative.

25:43.412 --> 25:45.113
Just like we discussed.

25:45.114 --> 25:46.514
Last year.

25:46.515 --> 25:48.750
Nigeria's had zero rain since.

25:48.751 --> 25:52.153
Plus, agricultural projects
in sub-Saharan Africa

25:52.154 --> 25:54.121
haven't cleared the Hill in months.

25:55.323 --> 25:56.925
(clears throat)

25:56.926 --> 25:59.594
There must be, uh, something we can do.

25:59.595 --> 26:03.898
This is a very, very important request.

26:03.899 --> 26:05.900
All your requests are important.

26:05.901 --> 26:07.469
And yet I can't get an answer

26:07.470 --> 26:09.404
from the seventh floor as to why.

26:09.405 --> 26:11.405
Can you tell me what this is for?

26:15.443 --> 26:17.779
No wonder the world
thinks we're a CIA front.

26:17.780 --> 26:20.814
Okay, Candice.

26:21.752 --> 26:22.983
Name your price.

26:24.185 --> 26:25.853
What do you want?

26:27.425 --> 26:28.623
_

26:28.878 --> 26:30.102
_

26:30.687 --> 26:33.582
_

26:34.664 --> 26:37.746
_

26:39.756 --> 26:41.898
_

26:46.686 --> 26:48.942
_

26:49.756 --> 26:51.371
_

26:52.043 --> 26:53.207
_

26:54.041 --> 26:55.581
_

26:56.972 --> 26:58.184
_

26:59.382 --> 27:01.791
_

27:02.754 --> 27:04.522
_

27:05.066 --> 27:06.855
_

27:07.297 --> 27:08.980
_

27:10.623 --> 27:12.683
_

27:12.684 --> 27:14.202
(knocking on door)

27:14.203 --> 27:16.204
(door opens)

27:16.205 --> 27:18.005
Dmitri? Hello, Ivan.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.841
Dr. McCord.

27:22.277 --> 27:24.446
I am afraid I am busy.

27:24.447 --> 27:26.648
I invited him here.

27:26.649 --> 27:29.283
He can help.

27:30.295 --> 27:32.921
_

27:34.456 --> 27:36.124
HENRY: I'm here with an offer.

27:36.125 --> 27:37.559
Would you like to hear it?

27:37.560 --> 27:41.863
Dmitri tells me you're in a
very dangerous situation.

27:41.864 --> 27:44.032
You face a public trial

27:44.033 --> 27:45.700
designed to humiliate
you and your family,

27:45.701 --> 27:48.335
a dishonorable discharge
and a prison term.

27:50.105 --> 27:52.107
This is a big misunderstanding.

27:52.108 --> 27:55.276
Dmitri has interfered

27:55.277 --> 27:57.545
unnecessarily.

27:57.546 --> 28:00.181
HENRY: Dmitri came to me
to help save your life.

28:00.182 --> 28:01.816
With my ties to the State Department,

28:01.817 --> 28:03.718
I can guarantee you an asylum hearing.

28:03.719 --> 28:05.787
But in order for the
application to go through,

28:05.788 --> 28:08.089
you have to tell the
truth about who you are.

28:08.090 --> 28:11.659
I am a Russian captain in the army.

28:11.660 --> 28:14.896
I serve under General
Vladimir Doroshevich.

28:14.897 --> 28:17.764
I only follow his orders.

28:22.704 --> 28:25.339
I have no life if I am not a soldier.

28:26.508 --> 28:29.544
Then talk to Doroshevich before
he leaves DC for Moscow tonight.

28:29.545 --> 28:31.179
He respects you.

28:31.180 --> 28:32.480
And tell him what?

28:32.481 --> 28:34.749
HENRY: Ask him to intervene
with the recall on your behalf,

28:34.750 --> 28:37.519
make a case for your
dedication and commitment.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.888
I understand that
Doroshevich is a fair man.

28:39.889 --> 28:42.756
I think he'd want to keep a good soldier.

28:48.496 --> 28:52.233
Look, I don't want to
get sappy or anything.

28:52.234 --> 28:53.934
Thank God.

28:55.703 --> 28:57.472
I honestly...

28:57.473 --> 28:59.374
respect the work that you do.

28:59.375 --> 29:03.645
And I know that it's
dangerous and exhausting,

29:03.646 --> 29:05.380
and you have limited resources.

29:05.381 --> 29:06.748
(chuckles)

29:06.749 --> 29:08.383
And from where you're standing,

29:08.384 --> 29:12.353
it can look like the people
who create policy don't care.

29:12.354 --> 29:16.191
Well... at the very least,

29:16.192 --> 29:18.759
don't understand.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.166
So how do you do it?

29:25.167 --> 29:27.202
What part?

29:27.203 --> 29:28.503
All of it.

29:28.504 --> 29:32.106
How do you perform surgery?

29:32.107 --> 29:35.477
Well, first you wash your hands...

29:35.478 --> 29:37.078
- No, dumbass.
- then you, uh...

29:37.079 --> 29:38.379
I mean over there.

29:38.380 --> 29:42.383
Yeah, like, how do you... how
do you make it work over there?

29:42.384 --> 29:44.385
To the extent that it does.

29:44.386 --> 29:46.321
Improvisation.

29:46.322 --> 29:49.390
You never have enough
medicine or equipment,

29:49.391 --> 29:54.028
so you're constantly thinking
of ways to create fixes,

29:54.029 --> 29:57.131
ways that you probably
don't want to know about.

29:57.132 --> 30:00.768
Don't tell me you're meeting
people in parking garages

30:00.769 --> 30:02.103
and back alleys or...

30:02.104 --> 30:03.404
No.

30:03.405 --> 30:05.507
No, there's a courier in our area.

30:05.508 --> 30:08.476
He knows how to navigate the system.

30:08.477 --> 30:12.514
The irony is... the more
chaotic the system,

30:12.515 --> 30:15.149
the more effective the underground.

30:15.150 --> 30:19.854
Black market ticks along in
places like Syria and Iraq.

30:19.855 --> 30:23.157
The NGO folks don't
like to talk about it,

30:23.158 --> 30:27.762
but corruption is what
holds everything together.

30:27.763 --> 30:31.466
But then how can you trust any of it?

30:31.467 --> 30:33.201
I mean, like, this courier,

30:33.202 --> 30:34.836
he's dealing in stolen cargo?

30:34.837 --> 30:36.070
How do you...?

30:36.071 --> 30:37.872
Well, this guy is a former medic,

30:37.873 --> 30:41.910
so he's got a lot of real shady clients.

30:41.911 --> 30:43.977
And he's been vetted to high heaven.

30:45.013 --> 30:48.416
We figure that if it works for them,

30:48.417 --> 30:50.084
works for us.

30:50.085 --> 30:51.719
"Them" meaning who?

30:51.720 --> 30:53.420
ISIS?

30:54.722 --> 30:56.990
We don't ask.

30:59.081 --> 31:00.328
NADINE: <i>Welcome back, ma'am.</i>

31:00.329 --> 31:01.629
How was fishing?

31:01.630 --> 31:02.797
Productive.

31:02.798 --> 31:04.032
How'd it go here?

31:04.033 --> 31:08.036
Well, we had a protracted
negotiation with USAID,

31:08.037 --> 31:10.772
but we do believe we found
the source of the medicine.

31:10.773 --> 31:12.740
Yes, there's a hospital in Antakya

31:12.741 --> 31:15.777
that's seen a spike in
orders of tetrabenazine.

31:15.778 --> 31:19.147
Padding their stocks in case
some of it falls off the truck.

31:19.148 --> 31:20.782
Exactly.

31:20.783 --> 31:23.117
Well, this is great, because
I have to tell you,

31:23.118 --> 31:26.454
I think that I may have figured out

31:26.455 --> 31:30.258
how the medicine gets from
there to ISIS leadership.

31:30.259 --> 31:31.559
Huh.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.895
ELIZABETH: Really good, guys, really good.

31:33.896 --> 31:38.199
I mean... great work with USAID.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.867
- Not easy.
- (zipper zips)

31:39.868 --> 31:42.870
But I do have a queasy feeling

31:42.871 --> 31:44.973
that we may owe them something.

31:44.974 --> 31:48.610
Um, ma'am, you have

31:48.611 --> 31:51.946
a three-hour dinner next
week with Candice Templeton.

31:51.947 --> 31:53.348
(Elizabeth scoffs)

31:53.349 --> 31:57.785
However did you manage to find
the time in my schedule, Blake?

31:57.786 --> 31:59.087
That's my superpower.

31:59.088 --> 32:02.824
Let's hope that your
superpower pays off.

32:02.825 --> 32:05.493
Will you get me Director
Williams on the telephone?

32:05.494 --> 32:06.894
BLAKE: Yes, ma'am.

32:06.895 --> 32:10.263
Let's see if your information
and mine can tango.

Ivan?

Ivan?

34:39.739 --> 34:40.837
What do you have, Sean?

34:40.838 --> 34:44.139
We cross-referenced the
medical NGOs in Aleppo.

34:44.141 --> 34:46.976
Several ID'd a courier
fitting the description

34:46.976 --> 34:48.010
Secretary McCord gave us.

34:48.011 --> 34:49.911
The man we're looking for

34:49.913 --> 34:51.414
is Tariq Mansour.

34:51.415 --> 34:53.315
With the help of HUMINT

34:53.315 --> 34:56.485
in Turkey and Syria, we
tracked his supply chain.

34:56.485 --> 34:59.688
<i>Every order starts out smuggled
by an underling of Mansour's</i>

34:59.689 --> 35:02.725
<i>from Devlet Arastirma
hospital in Antakya, Turkey.</i>

35:02.726 --> 35:04.026
<i>From there, the medicine passes</i>

35:04.027 --> 35:06.595
<i>through the Turkish-Syrian border here,</i>

35:06.596 --> 35:08.097
at Bab Al-Hawa.

35:08.098 --> 35:10.099
Now, the border's known to be porous,

35:10.100 --> 35:13.135
but these guys have greased every wheel.

35:13.136 --> 35:15.938
Then it's on to Aleppo,

35:15.939 --> 35:17.306
<i>where Mansour's underlings</i>

35:17.307 --> 35:18.808
<i>deliver the small-time supplies...</i>

35:18.809 --> 35:20.910
<i>pain relievers, gauze.</i>

35:20.911 --> 35:22.711
<i>But when it comes to the high-end stuff,</i>

35:22.712 --> 35:25.481
<i>Mansour's the only one
who can deliver them.</i>

35:25.482 --> 35:28.350
<i>To ensure the quality
of the expensive drugs,</i>

35:28.351 --> 35:31.220
<i>he extends a face-to-face guarantee.</i>

ELIZABETH: <i>Tetrabenazine

35:34.057 --> 35:36.192

If Mansour is going to
lead us to Adam Fanning,

35:39.095 --> 35:40.463
it'll happen today.

35:40.464 --> 35:42.097
DALTON: Contact Nellis.

35:42.098 --> 35:43.899
I want a drone on this courier

35:43.900 --> 35:46.035
the minute he heads east from Aleppo.

35:46.036 --> 35:47.000
Yes, sir.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.438
We'll let you know as soon as
he's in ISIS territory.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.739
(students murmur quietly)

35:52.808 --> 35:55.109
We did this to him.

35:57.746 --> 35:58.881
Why did I say anything?

35:58.882 --> 35:59.915
This is my fault.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.383
No, it's not.

36:01.384 --> 36:02.585
No, it is this coup.

36:02.586 --> 36:04.720
These-these... these power-starved men

36:04.721 --> 36:06.155
and their straw dog, Maria Ostrov.

36:06.156 --> 36:07.456
They will not stop until
they take us back

36:07.457 --> 36:09.158
- to the days of Stalin.
- Okay, come on. Come with me.

36:09.159 --> 36:10.626
We can talk about this later.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.194
No, we're not going to
talk about this later.

36:12.195 --> 36:13.629
- We're gonna talk about it now.
- Just keep walking, okay?

36:13.630 --> 36:15.130
- You need to calm down.
- No, I am through with Russia!

36:15.131 --> 36:16.432
I am through with Russia, okay?

36:16.433 --> 36:18.234
I want to take the deal
that you offered Ivan.

36:18.235 --> 36:19.702
Let me defect. Give me asylum.

36:19.703 --> 36:20.653
That's not possible.

36:20.654 --> 36:21.315
What? Why?

36:21.316 --> 36:22.196
Because for five minutes

36:22.197 --> 36:24.639
I had some crazy idea
that I could be a spy?

36:25.654 --> 36:26.775
I want out.

36:26.776 --> 36:28.077
I want to stay here.

36:28.078 --> 36:30.513
Okay.

36:30.514 --> 36:31.846
You can take Ivan's place.

36:32.801 --> 36:34.016
But not by defecting.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.784
Not by giving up.

36:35.785 --> 36:38.254
What do you want me to do?

36:38.255 --> 36:40.489
Tell General Doroshevich
to recall <i>you</i> to Moscow,

36:40.490 --> 36:41.857
to work by his side.

36:41.858 --> 36:44.460
That's where you can
really make a difference.

36:44.461 --> 36:47.095
Don't let Ivan die in vain.

37:34.311 --> 37:35.644
Who is he talking to?

37:35.645 --> 37:37.479
The next link in the chain.

37:37.480 --> 37:40.249
Colonel, can we have
a closer view of the man

37:40.250 --> 37:41.784
Mansour is talking to? Over.

37:41.785 --> 37:43.951
COLONEL: Copy.

37:49.892 --> 37:51.126
It's him.

37:51.127 --> 37:52.328
That's Fanning.

37:52.329 --> 37:53.696
I'll be damned.

37:53.697 --> 37:55.130
We have a clean shot, Mr. President.

37:55.131 --> 37:57.533
We can take him out now,
along with the courier.

37:57.534 --> 37:58.934
Or we can grab him up.

37:58.935 --> 38:01.070
How long to get Delta in there?

38:01.071 --> 38:02.705
Assault team's 40 minutes out, sir.

38:02.706 --> 38:04.940
That's possibly enough
time to take him alive.

38:04.941 --> 38:06.375
Someone at Fanning's level

38:06.376 --> 38:09.411
could have significant
intelligence on ISIS.

38:09.412 --> 38:11.280
JACKSON: Or the raid goes south,

38:11.281 --> 38:15.149
and American soldiers become
Jihadi Judd's next victims.

38:23.962 --> 38:24.662
_ _

38:29.772 --> 38:31.567
The compound's heavily guarded.

38:31.988 --> 38:33.673
Delta will have to pass through

38:33.674 --> 38:35.975
three security rings.

38:42.883 --> 38:43.884
Take him out, Admiral.

38:43.885 --> 38:45.886
Colonel, engage target.

38:45.887 --> 38:47.454
Over.

38:47.455 --> 38:48.922
COLONEL: Copy. Missile on the way.

38:48.923 --> 38:50.991
Time of flight: eight seconds.

38:50.992 --> 38:52.759
Seven.

38:52.760 --> 38:53.927
Six.

38:53.928 --> 38:54.928
Five.

38:54.929 --> 38:55.929
Four.

38:55.930 --> 38:56.930
Three.

Over.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.005
PARKER: Copy.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.842
Mr. President, I recommend

39:08.843 --> 39:12.012
addressing the nation immediately.

39:12.013 --> 39:14.614
Release Fanning's identity
and confirm the kill.

39:14.615 --> 39:17.217
Set it up.

39:17.218 --> 39:18.685
Thank you, everyone.

39:18.686 --> 39:19.920
Good work.

39:19.921 --> 39:21.454
Bess, I'd, uh,

39:21.455 --> 39:23.456
I'd like you to stand with
me during the address.

39:23.457 --> 39:25.324
Of course, sir.

39:34.768 --> 39:37.304
Thank you, Eddie.

39:37.305 --> 39:38.671
Good night.

39:43.109 --> 39:44.277
- Hi.
- Hey. - Hey.

39:44.278 --> 39:45.912
You guys are up late.

39:45.913 --> 39:48.181
Yeah, we, uh, saw you
with the president.

39:48.182 --> 39:49.983
(sighs) Yeah.

39:49.984 --> 39:51.953
Were you in the Situation Room for it?

39:51.954 --> 39:52.650
JASON: Yes!

39:52.651 --> 39:55.188
Yes! We freakin' lit up Jihadi Judd.

39:55.189 --> 39:57.266
- It was like... (mimics explosion)
- HENRY: Jason!

39:57.267 --> 39:58.091
Cut it out!

39:58.092 --> 40:00.059
It wasn't a video game. Go to your room.

40:02.229 --> 40:04.064
I mean, it was a drone strike,

40:04.065 --> 40:06.465
- so it kind of...
- Jason.

40:07.467 --> 40:10.002
How did you guys even find him?

40:10.937 --> 40:12.072
Go ahead.

40:12.073 --> 40:13.572
Tell them how you found him.

40:14.774 --> 40:16.409
Will you guys please go to bed?

40:16.410 --> 40:17.444
Yeah.

40:17.445 --> 40:19.378
Come on, guys, let's go upstairs.

40:22.616 --> 40:24.284
WILL: You used me.

40:24.285 --> 40:25.252
You exploited a moment

40:25.253 --> 40:26.564
of what I thought was real connection

40:26.565 --> 40:28.121
for your own gain.

40:28.122 --> 40:30.056
My gain?

40:30.057 --> 40:32.993
Adam Fanning waged war on our country.

40:32.994 --> 40:35.161
And-and my courier?

40:35.162 --> 40:36.965
What was he, just-just
"collateral damage"?

40:36.966 --> 40:39.032
He sells drugs for ISIS.
Have you even seen the...

40:39.033 --> 40:40.500
You knew that he was
the only decent source

40:40.501 --> 40:43.036
of rare pharma in Western Syria.

40:43.037 --> 40:44.671
People, regular people, children

40:44.672 --> 40:46.473
are going to die without his drugs.

40:46.474 --> 40:48.275
I know that.

40:48.276 --> 40:49.943
And...?

40:49.944 --> 40:51.378
And I also know

40:51.379 --> 40:53.280
that someone else is
gonna fill his shoes.

40:53.281 --> 40:56.215
So... so the Syrian civilians,
they mean nothing to you.

40:58.218 --> 40:59.219
(laughs bitterly)

40:59.220 --> 41:01.388
Yes, you got me.

41:01.389 --> 41:05.025
Human life has no value to me.

41:05.026 --> 41:06.426
Go ahead.

41:06.427 --> 41:08.928
I mean, reduce the entire world's

41:08.929 --> 41:10.363
most complex situations

41:10.364 --> 41:12.799
into sweeping generalities.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.601
As opposed to justifying everything

41:14.602 --> 41:16.903
in the name of national security?

41:16.904 --> 41:18.772
I know the costs.

41:18.773 --> 41:23.743
I see every horrible angle.

41:23.744 --> 41:26.946
I just don't have the luxury of
being an island like you do.

41:26.947 --> 41:30.050
Well, maybe the world
would be better off

41:30.051 --> 41:32.886
if your angles got the
hell off of my island.

41:32.887 --> 41:34.888
Because let's be clear, here.

41:34.889 --> 41:36.589
You didn't pull me off of the job

41:36.590 --> 41:38.325
for the benefit of humankind.

41:38.326 --> 41:39.726
This was about you.

41:39.727 --> 41:43.196
You and-and your lifelong

41:43.197 --> 41:45.165
panic about... about...

41:45.166 --> 41:47.033
Something happening to you?

41:47.034 --> 41:50.169
Yes.

41:52.739 --> 41:54.606
Yeah, I'll cop to that one.

42:03.149 --> 42:05.685
Here.

42:05.686 --> 42:09.089
It's a ticket to Ankara.

42:09.090 --> 42:10.824
You leave first thing.

42:10.825 --> 42:12.625
From there, a convoy
will take you to Aleppo

42:12.626 --> 42:14.828
and you can go back to
doing what you were doing.

42:14.829 --> 42:18.765
A... A layover in London?

42:18.766 --> 42:20.866
You-you couldn't resist, could you?

42:22.168 --> 42:23.803
It's not for you.

42:23.804 --> 42:25.204
It's for Annie.

42:27.307 --> 42:29.608
(sighs)

42:30.777 --> 42:32.712
(Elizabeth sighs)

42:32.713 --> 42:35.714
That sounded like the
opposite of fly fishing.

42:37.484 --> 42:40.420
Can we talk about it later?

42:40.421 --> 42:42.688
(sighs)

42:47.327 --> 42:49.595
I'm sorry about Ivan.

42:51.498 --> 42:53.433
Me, too.

42:53.434 --> 42:56.836
Did he have something
to do with your job?

42:56.837 --> 42:58.772
The one we don't talk about?

42:58.773 --> 43:01.073
(sighs heavily)

43:02.675 --> 43:05.644
Sorry. I don't mean to push.

43:12.018 --> 43:15.455
When you were an operative,

43:15.456 --> 43:17.390
how did you know

43:17.391 --> 43:19.725
when you were in too deep?

43:22.662 --> 43:25.365
I didn't.

43:25.366 --> 43:28.000
Not until it was too late.

43:34.937 --> 43:41.983
