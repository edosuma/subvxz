00:01.793 --> 00:03.003
<i>Jamie Tartt collects.</i>

00:03.003 --> 00:06.006
<i>He's been Richmond's unequivocal
talisman today.</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:08.842
<i>He finds Rojas and it's there!</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:15.015
<i>Richmond have beaten
Aston Villa three-nil,</i>

00:15.015 --> 00:18.352
<i>with an offensive display
as dazzling as it is unfamiliar.</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:22.940
<i>AFC Richmond make it
two decisive wins in a row.</i>

00:22.940 --> 00:25.817
<i>Southampton never knew what hit them.</i>

00:26.777 --> 00:30.030
<i>Bumbercatch with a 95th-minute winner
over Tottenham.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:33.617
<i>The dog track has gone absolutely potty!</i>

00:33.617 --> 00:37.162
Another sensational win
for Richmond away at Everton.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.374
That's four in a row. Amazing.
Life is good for the Greyhounds.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.752
It's a lucky streak.
What goes up always comes down.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.879
<i>Exciting times on Nelson Road,</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:50.133
<i>and you have to think that no one
is happier than Coach Ted Lasso.</i>

00:57.933 --> 00:59.685
I'm glad this little trip
worked out for y'all.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.563
Yeah. Henry's really excited
to spend the weekend with you.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.272
Oh, yeah. Well, you know...

01:04.772 --> 01:07.276
I'll take face-to-face time
over FaceTime anytime.

01:08.861 --> 01:12.114
Yeah. And you know, I wanna say,
it's been nice to...

01:12.114 --> 01:14.533
get to remeet you, Dr. Jacob.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.786
Ted, please. I insist, just call me Jake.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.831
You got it, Jake.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.166
Oh, nope. Still feels weird to me,
you know?

01:23.166 --> 01:27.171
Like whenever I hear white
folks call Jay-Z "Jigga man," you know?

01:27.171 --> 01:29.006
Or like when you see
a priest wearing shorts.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.966
Yeah, exactly. Weird, you know?

01:30.966 --> 01:34.011
Or when you get pulled over
by a cop who's the same age as you.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.846
You're like, "Come on, man, be cool.

01:35.846 --> 01:37.556
What we doing here?" You know?

01:39.433 --> 01:41.393
Can I get some more money
for the pinball, please?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.103
- Yeah, let's see--
- Yeah.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
- You go. You go ahead.
- Okay.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.317
I don't know what I have. Let's see.

01:48.317 --> 01:54.156
There are some magnets I gotta bring back
to work and a matchbook.

01:54.156 --> 01:56.366
Maybe I do. Let me just see. I got-- No.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.160
A pocketful of American coins

01:58.160 --> 02:02.080
and a complimentary sleep mask that
did not fit 'cause I have a huge head.

02:02.998 --> 02:07.169
Come on, Prince Henry. I rigged
the machine so you can play without coins.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.586
You said that was impossible.

02:10.756 --> 02:14.426
Here you go.
Two English breakfasts. Enjoy.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.969
Thank you.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.054
Nothing's impossible.

02:21.517 --> 02:25.103
I should wash my hands
'cause I touched dirty money.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.189
I'm a hand-wash guy, Ted.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.273
Yeah.

02:30.609 --> 02:31.735
He's a hand-wash guy.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.363
- Well, better safe than sorry.
- Yeah. Right?

02:34.863 --> 02:37.074
- Are you sure you're not hungry?
- No, I'm good.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.284
I had a big old piece of cereal at home.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.119
- Okay.
- Yeah.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.205
Besides, you know, English breakfast to me

02:43.205 --> 02:46.041
is just a pile of a bunch
of little, tiny piles, you know?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.334
But please, help yourself.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.337
You're gonna need your strength,
hiking around that English countryside.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.423
Oh, yeah. About that.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.675
Yeah?

02:55.342 --> 02:58.053
Jake told me on the plane
he's actually taking me to Paris.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.848
It was a surprise.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.059
Paris.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.272
Great, yeah. Which one?

03:08.856 --> 03:13.569
You know, Paris, Texas? Paris, Arkansas?
Paris, Ohio? Or the other Paris in Ohio?

03:13.569 --> 03:17.573
Actually,
I think there's three Parises in Ohio.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.199
Or do you say "Parese"? Par--

03:20.075 --> 03:23.453
"Paris" Paris. You know, in France.

03:26.582 --> 03:27.666
The default Paris.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.710
Right.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.463
Cool. Well, that's gonna be real...

03:36.133 --> 03:38.135
I wish I knew the French word for "nice."

03:39.219 --> 03:40.220
<i>Très bien.</i>

03:41.138 --> 03:42.139
<i>Très bien.</i>

04:19.343 --> 04:24.806
You know, I think hooking up with you
might just be my favorite thing ever.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.267
Yeah?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.479
Yeah. Well, second favorite.

04:33.524 --> 04:34.775
Go on then.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.202
Sorry.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.329
There goes my boner.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.211
My dad told my Uncle Bernie I'm in town,

04:54.211 --> 04:59.132
and he's invited me to his big, swanky
polo event tomorrow. Would you wanna go?

05:01.844 --> 05:05.138
The one time I've been on a horse
was for a photo shoot years ago.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.059
Horse was so drugged up that it could've
been the guitarist in the Sex Pistols.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.770
No, we don't play.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.356
We just stand around and drink champagne.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.359
- Oh, right. Of course, yeah.
- It's for charity.

05:17.359 --> 05:21.572
You know, celebrities,
red carpet, big trays of tiny food.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.907
It's a whole thing. We should go.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.911
Be fun to show off my girlfriend.

05:29.663 --> 05:33.959
Sounds great. And it gives me
an excuse to go to Harvey Nicks!

05:35.294 --> 05:38.422
Okay, I'll tell Uncle Bernie.
He's gonna love you.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.465
I didn't know your dad had a brother.

05:41.175 --> 05:46.138
No, sorry.
"Uncle" Bernie is a family friend.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.558
- Bernard Arnault. He runs--
- Moët and Louis Vuitton!

05:49.558 --> 05:53.020
- Does he need another fake niece?
- You can ask him yourself tomorrow.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.480
That's very cool.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.359
More importantly...

06:01.111 --> 06:02.905
- where were we?
- Champagne.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.618
Harvey Nicks.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.455
Fake uncles.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.124
Drugged horses.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.387
Oh, fuck.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.821
- Hey. Morning.
- Morning.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.408
That was nice.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.703
You staying over, I mean. Not the...

06:52.496 --> 06:55.457
Well, that-- Obviously, that was nice
as well. I don't--

06:57.167 --> 06:59.211
- Your breath smells good.
- Thank you.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.714
Did you go off and brush your teeth
and then sneak back into bed?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.591
Yeah, I did.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.385
Does my breath smell awful?

07:07.886 --> 07:09.263
Yeah, it does, ac--

07:09.263 --> 07:10.764
Yeah, it is quite bad.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.983
So, look, would you want to go
and grab some breakfast?

07:20.983 --> 07:23.485
I don't know
if you've got plans or what.

07:23.485 --> 07:24.778
No, breakfast sounds good.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.950
You know, I don't have

07:29.950 --> 07:34.079
any meals planned with anybody else
in the foreseeable future.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.039
I don't know. Do you?

07:37.457 --> 07:38.458
No, I don't.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.756
So if someone were to ask about us,

07:44.756 --> 07:48.760
what terminology would you
best recommend describes our relationship?

07:50.179 --> 07:51.972
No, there's no pressure to label us...

07:52.681 --> 07:54.516
you and I. I just-- Yeah.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.477
- All right.
- Yeah.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.105
Yeah, no, 'cause I'm just cool.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.733
Just cool and casual. I just--

08:04.776 --> 08:08.739
Me too. Wait. Did you shave?

08:09.239 --> 08:12.951
Yeah, and showered. After I used
the toilet in next door's flat.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.078
Weird.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.346
Wow.

08:32.346 --> 08:36.850
<i>Hi, baby. I know you're all the way up
there in chilly Newcastle,</i>

08:37.392 --> 08:40.187
<i>so here's a little something
to warm you up.</i>

08:48.278 --> 08:50.489
Nope. You're right. I shouldn't watch it.

08:54.284 --> 08:57.871
Shit. How did that get on the Internet?
A private video that--

08:57.871 --> 09:00.916
Apparently, there's been some
massive leak. It's not just you.

09:00.916 --> 09:04.586
It's actresses, singers,
a couple politicians,

09:04.586 --> 09:07.798
some random reality show guy
with a very big dick.

09:07.798 --> 09:11.093
Oh, my God. I can't believe
this is happening. I--

09:12.010 --> 09:14.930
How did that-- Fuck! Fuck.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.015
Hey. Hey, hey.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.476
No, this is bad, because my friends
are gonna see this. My family.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.311
- The team.
- Take a breath.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.230
Oh, my God, and the office.
I'm their boss.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.357
Keeley, stop. Take a breath.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.110
Yeah.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.279
I'm so sorry this is happening.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.157
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna take care of it, okay?

09:35.868 --> 09:36.869
Thank you.

09:38.829 --> 09:42.416
Okay, Henry. We have scored excellently
on kit presentation.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.210
Hanger integrity: insane.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.796
But we did drop a little
on the towel folding, didn't we?

09:47.796 --> 09:51.008
But that's okay. I've been there.
But that does lead us on to our next task,

09:51.008 --> 09:53.302
which is towel placement.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.804
The question is, are you ready?

09:57.097 --> 09:57.931
Yeah.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.016
Are you steady?

09:59.641 --> 10:00.642
Yeah.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.936
In that case, go!

10:12.571 --> 10:14.698
Is this a game or child labor?

10:14.698 --> 10:17.117
In late-stage capitalism,
what's the difference?

10:17.117 --> 10:19.244
- Word.
- You're doing really well, Henry.

10:19.244 --> 10:22.372
Then we'll go into the weight room and do
some cleaning next. That'll be great.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.960
Hey, fellas, let me ask you something.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.547
If you could propose to someone,
you know, anywhere in the world,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.674
where would you do it?

10:32.674 --> 10:33.926
Paris.

10:34.927 --> 10:37.221
The Hall of Mirrors
at Linderhof Palace in Germany,

10:37.221 --> 10:40.182
because if she agreed,
I'd be surrounded by a thousand yeses.

10:41.558 --> 10:42.935
Or Paris. Why?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.314
Dr. Jacob is gonna propose to Michelle.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.276
- Yeah.
- Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.

10:54.363 --> 10:57.741
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Yes, I do.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.160
Diamond Dogs, mount up!

11:00.744 --> 11:01.745
Never fucking mind.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.085
What-- what's going on?
What-- What's the Diamond Dogs?

11:08.085 --> 11:09.837
It's a living fucking nightmare!

11:09.837 --> 11:12.881
The Diamond Dogs are a group of men
committed to supporting each other

11:12.881 --> 11:16.593
by sharing their most intimate thoughts,
feelings and experiences. You in or out?

11:16.593 --> 11:17.928
I'm in.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.263
Goddamn it!

11:19.263 --> 11:20.889
Roy chose "out."

11:20.889 --> 11:22.224
Yeah, I assumed.

11:28.522 --> 11:29.982
Sorry, just--

11:32.109 --> 11:34.528
- I just came as fast as I could.
- Take your time.

11:34.528 --> 11:38.031
- Hey, we appreciate your expediency.
- I got a bit light-headed.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.037
Balance. Okay. I am okay.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.790
First order of business: new member.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.627
Coach, you have the floor.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.005
Dr. Jacob and Michelle
are getting engaged.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.801
It's a hard moment when an ex moves on.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.263
Did he at least ask your permission?

12:02.097 --> 12:05.934
Well, I'm her ex-husband,
not her current father.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.644
So, no, he-- No.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.105
How did you find out?

12:11.190 --> 12:12.399
He took her to Paris.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.445
Can you believe that?

12:22.826 --> 12:23.827
That's it?

12:24.411 --> 12:26.955
- Unbelievable.
- What?

12:26.955 --> 12:30.834
Ted, I ran down the stairs for this
and up some other stairs.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.962
I'm gonna have leg cramps
in my sleep tonight.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.382
Okay, now, hold on a second, okay?
This is happening, all right?

12:37.382 --> 12:40.802
My man took Michelle to Paris
on a surprise trip.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.095
Why else would he do that?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.597
Can I just talk whenever?

12:46.016 --> 12:47.267
Well, he's right, Ted.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.645
You can't worry about something
that hasn't happened yet.

12:51.063 --> 12:56.109
What he said. If anything,
you should find out before you flip out.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.120
"Find out before you flip out," huh?

13:08.247 --> 13:12.042
Yeah, okay. No, that-- Yeah, you're right.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.296
Of course. Thank you. Yeah. Hey.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.466
All right. Anybody else got something?

13:21.260 --> 13:22.678
Roy,
you got anything you wanna talk about?

13:22.678 --> 13:24.596
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.807
All right. Well, Diamond Dogs,
disperse then.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.185
Woof!

13:43.782 --> 13:47.035
- Am I in trouble?
- No, nothing like that. No. Promise.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.330
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Oh, no, that's okay.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.500
No, thank you for coming.
Just take a seat. Thank you.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.960
Just waiting on one more.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.212
There you go.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.139
- Are we in trouble?
- No. Nobody's in trouble. Just...

14:07.139 --> 14:10.809
Well, you know, I just don't wanna say it
until everyone's here, so...

14:14.855 --> 14:17.566
I'll call. It's fine. I'll just call.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.571
- <i>Hello, Coach Shelley.</i>
- Hello, Ms. Kakes.

14:23.113 --> 14:27.910
I just wondered if Rupert was on his way
to my office for our special meeting.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.454
<i>No, he's not coming to that.</i>

14:31.538 --> 14:34.541
I mean, he said that he would,
so-- I mean, is he busy?

14:34.541 --> 14:35.626
<i>No.</i>

14:40.088 --> 14:43.383
It's fine. Don't worry.
I guess it's just us then.

14:44.009 --> 14:48.764
For the very first meeting of the--
Drumroll, please.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.892
Love Hounds.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.360
I thought that we men could

15:01.360 --> 15:03.987
get together whenever we needed,
every now and then,

15:03.987 --> 15:06.156
and just talk and help each other out

15:06.156 --> 15:08.158
with how things
are going on in our personal lives.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.535
Okay.

15:09.535 --> 15:13.664
Well, I'd love to talk about the stresses
of taking care of my aging parents.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.123
Yeah, I'll start.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.710
So I-- I've started seeing this girl,
and it's going real well.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.295
I really like her. She's great.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.090
But she's hesitant
to label our relationship,

15:23.090 --> 15:25.509
and I don't know whether to give her space

15:25.509 --> 15:28.887
or whether to let her know just how
strongly I feel about us being together.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.727
Disco, would you--
Do you got any thoughts or--

15:35.727 --> 15:37.688
I've been divorced three times.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.899
Never let them know how you feel.
It's very expensive.

15:42.818 --> 15:43.819
Okay.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.946
I read this book that said,

15:45.946 --> 15:48.282
"If you like a woman,
you should insult her."

15:51.618 --> 15:53.954
Okay, this meeting's over,
and it'll probably never happen again.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.747
Thank you for coming. Thank you both.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.590
- Are we in trouble now?
- No, Roger. Just go. No. Thank you.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.757
It's all right.

16:09.303 --> 16:10.262
Hey, Boss.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.805
Morning, Ted.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.640
- Here you go.
- Morning. Thank you.

16:15.559 --> 16:16.768
I could use your help.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.980
Of course. Anything. Wait.
Shouldn't you be at training?

16:19.980 --> 16:23.150
Oh, yeah, but don't worry.
I've got that all covered.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.653
Go, go, go, go!

16:30.365 --> 16:32.659
Right. Okay, then. Well, how can I help?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.370
- I need to hire a private investigator.
- Why?

16:35.370 --> 16:38.248
'Cause Dr. Jacob took Michelle
to Paris, the French one,

16:38.832 --> 16:40.501
and I'm pretty sure he's gonna propose.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.213
Now I gotta find out if I'm right
so I don't flip out when I am.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.299
Ted, people visit Paris
for all kinds of reasons.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.552
- Yeah, like getting engaged.
- No. They go to eat the amazing food--

16:50.552 --> 16:52.221
- After getting engaged.
- No.

16:52.221 --> 16:54.264
Or they go to see Oscar Wilde's grave.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.807
- Before they get engaged.
- No.

16:55.807 --> 16:58.769
Or they visit the Louvre
to make fun of all the people

16:58.769 --> 17:00.687
taking blurry pictures
of an overrated painting.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.315
Yeah. Where'd you and Rupert get engaged?

17:04.691 --> 17:05.733
That doesn't matter.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.694
See, that's what I'm talking about.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.781
Right now,
Dr. Romance is probably getting ready

17:10.781 --> 17:12.491
to pop the question
on top of the Eiffel Tower,

17:12.491 --> 17:14.117
the most romantic
frigging place in the world.

17:14.117 --> 17:17.371
Oh, please. The Eiffel Tower
is just a lamppost with a publicist.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.458
Rebecca, come on. I just need to know
what's going on with them.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.086
Please help me.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.092
Okay, Ted. I'll make the call.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.138
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.765
I didn't know Oscar Wilde was dead.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.895
Some of his quotes feel so modern,
so of our time.

17:41.895 --> 17:42.980
I know. Powerful.

17:44.481 --> 17:45.691
Okay.

18:11.633 --> 18:12.467
Come in.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.429
Is now a good time, Ms. Jones?

18:15.429 --> 18:17.055
Yes, of course. Yeah.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.728
I'm sorry about what happened.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.814
Thank you, Barbara.

18:27.566 --> 18:29.109
Jack asked me to give you this.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.527
What is it?

18:30.527 --> 18:32.321
It's a statement.

18:35.324 --> 18:38.202
"Allow me to first offer
my sincere apologies.

18:38.827 --> 18:42.789
I deeply regret that video
that some of you have seen online.

18:42.789 --> 18:48.587
I'm beyond embarrassed, and I should have
never made this video in the first place."

18:50.506 --> 18:53.967
"I hope you can forgive me
while I learn and grow."

18:57.429 --> 19:00.766
Jack thought you could post it
across your socials.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.812
But maybe not Facebook,
'cause that's just for

19:05.812 --> 19:08.065
grandparents and racists now, isn't it?

19:47.646 --> 19:50.315
Hey, Jamie? Jamie? Can I get some Lynx?

19:50.315 --> 19:55.696
Yeah, sure, mate. What's your pit flavor?
I've got Epic Fresh, Sport Recharge, Java,

19:55.696 --> 20:00.742
Africa, Ice Chill, Gold, Excite, Black,
Dark Temptation and Leather and Cookies.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.287
- Leather and Cookies, please.
- Smart choice for a smart boy.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.538
- There you go.
- Lovely stuff.

20:04.538 --> 20:05.914
'Ey. Have you smelled this?

20:05.914 --> 20:10.711
Yo! Yo, y'all see this? A bunch of famous
chicks got their nude photos leaked.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.590
Oh, wow.

20:14.590 --> 20:17.176
Hey, <i>The Sun</i> is calling
it "The Great A-wank-ening."

20:18.260 --> 20:19.761
What is the opposite of clever?

20:19.761 --> 20:20.888
<i>The Sun</i>.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.057
Well, I guess I know
what I'm doing this weekend.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.559
Oi, fuck that.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.436
- We shouldn't be looking at that shit.
- Why not?

20:27.436 --> 20:30.272
Because it wasn't meant for us,
Jan Maas. It was their private property.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.192
Nah, bro. If you don't want
your private pictures out there,

20:33.192 --> 20:35.861
- just don't take naked pictures.
- Yeah.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.529
Especially being famous.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.448
What? Come on, man.

20:39.448 --> 20:41.491
- It's that simple.
- Fuck that, Cowburn. No, man.

20:41.491 --> 20:45.162
The only people to blame are the dickheads
who steal your shit and put it online.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.372
That's why I delete all the photos
on my phone.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.958
I swear down.
Especially 'cause I'm famous.

20:50.542 --> 20:52.336
Hey, listen. I'm with Jamie on this one.

20:52.336 --> 20:54.004
Whenever I have a relationship end,

20:54.004 --> 20:55.547
I ask the girl to go through my phone,

20:55.547 --> 20:57.716
delete any photos, videos.
Whatever she wants.

20:57.716 --> 20:59.718
- Bro, for real?
- Yeah. I'm being serious.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.137
You know,
one girl actually deleted Candy Crush.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.725
I was devastated, but I also understood.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.853
Hey, hold on. Once someone sends you
a photo, don't you own it?

21:10.437 --> 21:12.981
Copyright law on private photography
is quite murky.

21:12.981 --> 21:16.777
It's not about the law. It's about doing
what is right. Like in <i>Les Misérables</i>.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.029
Jean Valjean.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.697
Fuck yeah, 24601.

21:20.697 --> 21:23.367
No. 'Ey, deleting photos makes no sense.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.369
What? Do we delete our memories too?

21:25.369 --> 21:27.204
No, 'cause no one can steal your memories.

21:27.204 --> 21:29.957
That's not entirely true.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.750
- Yes.
- Nah.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.793
What if I took the photo?

21:32.793 --> 21:35.087
- You should delete it.
- What if it was a Christmas card?

21:35.087 --> 21:36.213
Delete it, bro.

21:36.213 --> 21:39.049
- What if it's artsy?
- What the fuck does that mean?

21:39.049 --> 21:40.717
It's in black-and-white.
You can't see anything.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.553
Delete it, mate.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.762
What if I'm in the photo?

21:43.762 --> 21:46.098
- Delete it.
- I know. What about sonograms?

21:46.682 --> 21:49.768
- Delete that shit.
- What if I'm French?

21:49.768 --> 21:53.272
- Delete it.
- What if she's naked, but not sexual?

21:53.272 --> 21:56.024
- What the fuck? What is she doing in it?
- She's just defecating.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.067
Delete it, bro.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.571
- What about a commissioned painting?
- Is it in a nice frame?

22:00.571 --> 22:01.989
It's leaning against my couch.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.615
Gotta burn it, bro.

22:04.825 --> 22:08.704
No, I shouldn't have to delete my
photos just because they might get stolen.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.831
It's my stuff. Don't touch it.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.375
I'm with that. That makes sense.

22:14.751 --> 22:15.919
Hey, guys.

22:17.087 --> 22:19.756
This article says Keeley
was one of the women who was hacked.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.516
Right. Everybody, take out your phones.

22:30.142 --> 22:33.562
Delete every single picture and video
that you've ever been sent. Now!

22:34.479 --> 22:37.900
We're all targets for this shit.
So delete everything.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.444
But we're professional footballers.
It could take days.

22:40.444 --> 22:41.904
If not weeks.

22:41.904 --> 22:43.155
Now!

22:49.161 --> 22:50.787
Hey, man, take out your phone.

23:45.217 --> 23:49.513
Colin. I wasn't playing.
I told you to delete that shit.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.473
I will, man. Fuck off.

23:54.268 --> 23:55.894
- I said delete it right now.
- Hey! Hey.

23:55.894 --> 23:56.812
Fuck off.

24:27.676 --> 24:31.180
This whole thing is so fucking upsetting.
I tried to watch the video this morning,

24:31.180 --> 24:34.516
and immediately, boom,
I was right back to being 15 again,

24:34.516 --> 24:38.145
reliving that moment
where this topless photo I took

24:38.145 --> 24:41.106
for Jimmy Daniels
was being passed around at school.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.192
Teenage boys can be awful.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.568
Mr. Daniels was my teacher.

24:45.944 --> 24:49.281
Well, men who act like teenage boys
actually are awful.

24:52.159 --> 24:53.160
I'm not an idiot.

24:54.077 --> 24:58.582
I know there are tons of topless photos
of me online. But those were my choice.

24:58.582 --> 25:02.002
Absolutely. It makes a huge difference.

25:02.586 --> 25:03.420
Yeah.

25:03.420 --> 25:05.380
Is there anything I can do to help?

25:06.924 --> 25:10.636
Restructure society so women
aren't constantly sexualized

25:10.636 --> 25:13.597
while simultaneously being crucified
for being sexual?

25:14.431 --> 25:15.682
On it.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.397
- Should I be ashamed or embarrassed?
- What?

25:22.397 --> 25:23.690
I don't know.

25:28.237 --> 25:29.488
How did Jack respond?

25:29.488 --> 25:31.198
Yeah, she was really lovely.

25:33.075 --> 25:37.079
And then I got this from her.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.714
She didn't write this.

25:47.714 --> 25:52.427
- You don't think so?
- No, it's caked in lawyer ick.

25:52.970 --> 25:54.221
You don't wanna say that, do you?

25:54.221 --> 25:55.347
No.

25:55.347 --> 25:59.685
Then tell her that.
Give her a chance to surprise you.

26:01.353 --> 26:02.563
Thank you.

26:03.897 --> 26:06.191
You know, there might be
a silver lining in all this.

26:07.484 --> 26:10.654
Just think of how many young women you are
going to teach how to masturbate properly.

26:10.654 --> 26:13.115
- What?
- I'm serious.

26:13.115 --> 26:15.367
Back in the day,
I didn't have a clue what I was doing.

26:15.367 --> 26:18.078
And then one day I accidentally bumped
into my parents' couch

26:18.078 --> 26:19.746
and it felt nice, so I stuck with it.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.625
A year later, my mum
had to have everything reupholstered.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.170
I blamed the dog.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.922
- Well, that was smart.
- Yeah, we didn't have a dog.

26:32.176 --> 26:33.552
I love you.

26:37.097 --> 26:38.098
I've got you.

26:39.558 --> 26:41.643
Also, French sisters.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.229
Spanish twins.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.691
Mom and daughter in Mexico.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.154
I'll miss you all. <i>Merci.</i>

26:53.197 --> 26:55.824
- Hi. Thank you, love. Bye.
- Hi. Yeah.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.831
Oi, Keeley.

27:03.874 --> 27:04.917
Hi.

27:05.876 --> 27:06.752
Hey.

27:10.172 --> 27:12.341
I heard about what happened.
It's fucking shit.

27:13.217 --> 27:15.093
Yeah, on so many levels.

27:16.637 --> 27:17.638
I'm so sorry.

27:19.181 --> 27:20.182
Thanks, Roy.

27:22.059 --> 27:23.352
You okay?

27:24.269 --> 27:26.772
All things considered, yeah. Yeah.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.650
Good.

27:31.235 --> 27:32.069
And you?

27:33.111 --> 27:35.656
Me, yeah, I'm good.

27:42.663 --> 27:43.664
Who was it for?

27:46.834 --> 27:47.668
What?

27:48.335 --> 27:50.003
The video. Who was it for?

27:54.675 --> 27:58.637
Shit, I'm sorry, Keeley. I'm really sorry.

27:58.637 --> 27:59.763
It's okay.

28:08.272 --> 28:09.523
Fuck.

28:14.111 --> 28:15.112
Fuck.

28:25.914 --> 28:26.915
Babe?

28:26.915 --> 28:28.000
In here.

28:35.799 --> 28:36.717
Hey.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.017
How you doing?

28:45.934 --> 28:50.063
Better. Worse. Everything.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.611
I got your statement.

28:57.154 --> 29:01.909
Yeah, I'm sorry. I called my dad
for advice, and his lawyers got involved.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.328
It's corporate fuckery at its finest.

29:07.581 --> 29:09.875
Yet, you had Barbara give it to me.

29:11.084 --> 29:16.340
Well, I tried to pick the most sensitive,
empathetic person I knew.

29:26.016 --> 29:27.309
Jack, I can't do it.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.603
I get it.

29:31.772 --> 29:34.525
I'm just so sorry
you have to deal with all of this shit.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.361
I'm sorry that you have to too.

29:48.997 --> 29:52.626
How about, for the next few hours,
we pretend none of this shit happened?

29:55.921 --> 29:58.757
Should we invite Barbara over?
Mess it all up?

29:58.757 --> 30:01.677
Yeah, let's definitely do that.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.345
I'll bet she's a party animal.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.347
You actually have no idea.

30:05.347 --> 30:07.057
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

30:08.892 --> 30:10.602
"Asim was right, Marcus thought.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.856
They were failing, and worse than that,
they were wasting time.

30:14.648 --> 30:16.942
They were gonna wait another day
before meeting?

30:16.942 --> 30:20.279
That would only leave two days,
and one of them was Saturday,

30:20.279 --> 30:22.197
when they wouldn't be at Breakfast Club.

30:22.906 --> 30:26.952
What if he never got his football
back from the creature? What if--

30:27.578 --> 30:30.330
A large hand landed on Marcus's shoulder,

30:30.330 --> 30:33.750
and he spun around
to find Mr. Anderson looking down at him.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.670
'I heard you went under the fence,'
he said."

30:39.339 --> 30:40.507
Oh, boy.

30:41.133 --> 30:44.011
We're gonna stop there for the night.
Cliff-hanger.

30:46.805 --> 30:48.223
Hey, how was your flight out?

30:48.223 --> 30:49.600
Good.

30:49.600 --> 30:50.684
Yeah?

30:50.684 --> 30:54.521
Do you know I have the most
air miles of any kid in my school?

30:54.521 --> 30:55.606
Oh, yeah?

30:56.899 --> 30:58.358
Yeah, that don't surprise me.

31:01.445 --> 31:04.198
Things at school good though?
You and Doug back on track and all that?

31:04.198 --> 31:05.324
Yeah.

31:06.491 --> 31:07.826
We're starting a band.

31:07.826 --> 31:10.037
Starting a band? Really?

31:11.205 --> 31:13.665
All right.
What instrument are you gonna play?

31:13.665 --> 31:16.168
Drums.

31:17.044 --> 31:19.463
Okay. Well, your mom's gonna love that.

31:20.047 --> 31:22.174
You know what?
Now might be a good time to let you know

31:22.174 --> 31:25.219
that Dave Grohl
learned to play drums on pillows.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.388
We don't have to tell your mom that
though right away.

31:30.057 --> 31:31.266
Yeah, exactly.

31:33.227 --> 31:34.311
Not as fun.

31:37.064 --> 31:38.649
Getting all your homework done?

31:39.316 --> 31:41.735
I have to, or I can't watch TV.

31:42.277 --> 31:45.030
Of course. You know how it goes.

31:45.614 --> 31:49.076
- Homework. Dinner. TV time.
- Homework. Dinner. TV time.

31:49.826 --> 31:50.827
That's right.

31:51.328 --> 31:52.746
Good system.

31:55.457 --> 31:56.458
Does...

31:59.545 --> 32:03.048
Does Dr. Jacob ever, you know,
hang out around TV time with you?

32:04.341 --> 32:05.592
Who is that?

32:09.304 --> 32:12.933
No. Sorry. Jake. Mom's friend, Jake.

32:13.976 --> 32:16.019
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes, yeah.

32:18.522 --> 32:20.232
Yeah. That's all right.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.027
Does he ever...

32:26.864 --> 32:29.449
read to you, like, at night?
Like, bedtime?

32:29.449 --> 32:30.909
It's totally fine.

32:31.910 --> 32:33.912
Nothing wrong with that,
I think that's great.

32:34.413 --> 32:37.958
It's good to have people in your life that
are excited to be around you, you know?

32:37.958 --> 32:40.919
Especially if, you know...

32:42.629 --> 32:44.882
it's someone who makes your mom happy
and all that.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.013
Which he seems to do.

32:53.765 --> 32:55.309
You guys get along all right?

33:17.623 --> 33:18.707
Come on, man.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.634
Good morning.

34:13.929 --> 34:15.639
Holy shit.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.685
I didn't wanna wake you, so I went out
and did some cheeky retail therapy.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.436
I loved it so much,
I didn't want to take it off.

34:21.436 --> 34:23.772
- What do you think?
- You look incredible.

34:23.772 --> 34:27.275
I mean, nothing but the best
for our dear Uncle Bernie, right?

34:28.569 --> 34:29.570
Shit.

34:30.112 --> 34:31.572
Babe, I canceled that.

34:32.822 --> 34:34.283
I just-- After the whole thing,

34:34.283 --> 34:37.911
I thought you wouldn't want
to be around a bunch of press and cameras.

34:39.830 --> 34:41.415
I'm sorry. I should've asked.

34:41.415 --> 34:43.917
- I thought I was doing the right thing.
- No. Don't apologize.

34:43.917 --> 34:47.588
You're right. Thank you.
I didn't think about that.

34:47.588 --> 34:49.047
But you know what?

34:49.630 --> 34:52.842
Leave it on, and I'll put on
my own killer fucking outfit,

34:52.842 --> 34:56.513
and we can go do something stupid
and fun and look amazing while doing it.

34:57.431 --> 34:58.307
Yeah, okay.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.559
No, actually, take it off.

35:00.559 --> 35:01.643
Oh, my God.

35:01.643 --> 35:03.770
- Keep the hat on, but...
- Jesus.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.732
...everything else is definitely coming off.

35:08.108 --> 35:09.401
Okay, bud.

35:10.027 --> 35:11.570
Coach and I got the whole day off.

35:11.570 --> 35:15.449
We're talking no game,
no scouting, no nothing.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.284
The world is our oyster.

35:21.121 --> 35:24.583
Okay. Well, how about
the world is our shrimp cocktail?

35:25.667 --> 35:26.752
Okay, great.

35:26.752 --> 35:29.129
All right, Coach. What are our options?

35:29.129 --> 35:34.134
There is a immersive
Jack the Ripper walking tour

35:34.718 --> 35:36.178
that Jane's been raving about.

35:36.178 --> 35:40.015
It's, like, six hours long,
and at one point, you get chased.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.187
What are you nuts? I mean, he's a boy.

35:45.187 --> 35:48.732
Fine, there's the London Eye.
There's the Tower of London.

35:48.732 --> 35:50.901
There's all the London stuff.

35:50.901 --> 35:52.319
There's a rave in Peckham.

35:52.319 --> 35:53.779
Okay, Coach, I appreciate it.

35:54.279 --> 35:57.533
Hey, big guy, what do you wanna do?
We could go to some museums.

35:57.533 --> 36:00.285
We could rent a boat,
float down the Thames.

36:00.285 --> 36:02.246
They spell it weird, but it is lovely.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.249
I wanna go see a football game.

36:10.003 --> 36:11.171
Okay.

36:11.171 --> 36:13.215
Let me see if I got this straight.

36:13.882 --> 36:16.969
My one day off from football,
you wanna go watch football?

36:17.594 --> 36:20.347
It's a little bit like asking a mailman
to go for a walk on his day off,

36:20.347 --> 36:21.557
don't you think?

36:22.641 --> 36:26.645
Yeah, you don't care. You're just a little
boy, ambivalent as all heck. Okay.

36:26.645 --> 36:29.314
Coach, we got any games in town today?

36:30.649 --> 36:31.692
There's one.

36:32.192 --> 36:33.443
Well, there you go.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.697
But I'm gonna have to stop at home first.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.677
Look. There he is, there.

36:59.178 --> 37:00.220
Hey, Nate!

37:02.973 --> 37:03.974
Nate!

37:06.185 --> 37:07.561
Nate!

37:09.813 --> 37:11.982
Coach, look who came to watch.

37:12.608 --> 37:14.484
Nate!

37:24.119 --> 37:25.537
Must be looking for tips.

37:27.497 --> 37:31.043
- He saw me, Dad. He saw me.
- Yeah, he did. He heard you too.

37:38.383 --> 37:39.760
Holy shit.

37:40.469 --> 37:42.971
Well, what can I say?
I'm the daughter of a billionaire.

37:42.971 --> 37:45.307
I learned to read a green
before I learned to read a book.

37:45.307 --> 37:49.228
Well, you might be a great golfer,
but I happen to be a really great cheater.

37:49.228 --> 37:51.021
So I think that makes us even.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.106
Watch out!

37:55.817 --> 37:57.778
Oh, my goodness, it's a tie.

37:57.778 --> 37:59.738
- Uh-huh?
- Yes, look.

38:00.572 --> 38:04.743
Isn't this way better than watching
polo with a bunch of old white men?

38:04.743 --> 38:05.994
Definitely.

38:06.745 --> 38:09.957
And I reckon the dinosaurs here
are much less handsy.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.834
Oh, yeah, the dinosaurs are.

38:11.834 --> 38:15.003
But I can't say the same
for some other people.

38:15.003 --> 38:15.921
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

38:15.921 --> 38:17.172
Jack?

38:19.758 --> 38:21.468
Sorry. Excuse me.

38:22.135 --> 38:23.053
Oh, my--

38:23.053 --> 38:26.348
- Hi.
- Look at you. Nice suit.

38:27.057 --> 38:29.476
What are you doing here?

38:29.476 --> 38:31.144
My sister's hen do.

38:35.107 --> 38:37.526
- She's marrying a golfer.
- A professional?

38:37.526 --> 38:39.987
Oh, no. He just golfs.

38:40.571 --> 38:42.364
We have to do a shot every hole,

38:42.364 --> 38:44.283
but the good news is her friends suck.

38:45.742 --> 38:46.577
Hello.

38:46.577 --> 38:48.495
This is Alyssa. We went to uni together.

38:48.495 --> 38:51.039
And this is my friend, Keeley Jones.

38:53.417 --> 38:54.334
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:54.334 --> 38:56.003
Keeley runs a PR firm.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.881
You or your family ever need anyone,
this is who you want.

39:00.132 --> 39:01.300
That's me.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.301
Cool.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.053
Alyssa! Come on!

39:05.053 --> 39:06.722
- Coming, Sis!
- Hurry up!

39:06.722 --> 39:08.015
Come on.

39:08.015 --> 39:09.558
Fucking families.

39:10.642 --> 39:12.769
Anyway, it was nice to see you, Jack.

39:12.769 --> 39:14.605
- Yeah, you too.
- Love the hat.

39:15.230 --> 39:16.607
Thanks. Yeah.

39:18.650 --> 39:22.571
All right, let's make things
a little more interesting, shall we?

39:23.238 --> 39:26.992
Ten pounds a hole,
but I will spot you 20 strokes.

39:26.992 --> 39:28.535
- You're on.
- But no cheating.

39:29.286 --> 39:30.412
Then only a pound a hole.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.167
Great match, Coach.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.622
- Hello, my darlings.
- Hey, Mae.

40:13.622 --> 40:17.209
- What have you three been up to today?
- We went to the West Ham game.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.257
Then you don't drink in this pub.

40:23.257 --> 40:25.384
- Hey, come on, Mae.
- He's a child.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.266
- Hey!
- Mae!

40:32.266 --> 40:33.433
Thank you.

40:33.433 --> 40:34.977
You think I wanted to fucking be there?

40:37.855 --> 40:40.691
You two are on probation.

40:40.691 --> 40:42.526
- Yes, ma'am.
- Fair enough.

40:43.026 --> 40:44.236
Bye, Mae.

40:52.870 --> 40:54.413
- Dad.
- Yeah?

40:54.413 --> 40:56.248
- Listen.
- What?

40:56.915 --> 40:58.000
The Beatles.

40:58.917 --> 40:59.877
Oh, yeah.

41:05.966 --> 41:08.510
Hey, you know what? I'll be right back.

41:14.933 --> 41:16.727
Hey, Boss, what do you got for me?

41:16.727 --> 41:21.064
Right. Ted, listen, I want you to know,
you do not have to go down this road.

41:21.064 --> 41:22.858
<i>I know, but I need to, okay?</i>

41:22.858 --> 41:25.277
'Cause right now,
Michelle and this Dr. Jacob fella

41:25.277 --> 41:28.488
could be sitting there, having dinner
at one of her favorite Parisian hotels,

41:28.488 --> 41:29.573
like the George Sank...

41:29.573 --> 41:31.325
- Cinq.
- ...or the Plaza Anthony.

41:31.325 --> 41:32.868
Athénée. Hold on.

41:32.868 --> 41:35.370
Her favorite hotels in Paris?
I thought you said she'd never been there.

41:35.370 --> 41:37.039
Yeah, she hasn't. But the George Stank...

41:37.039 --> 41:39.291
- Cinq.
- ...is from her favorite movie, <i>French Kiss</i>,

41:39.291 --> 41:41.210
- <i>and the Plaza Anthony--</i>
- Athénée.

41:41.210 --> 41:42.836
That's from her favorite TV show,

41:42.836 --> 41:44.505
- <i>Sex in the City.</i>
- <i>Sex and the City.</i>

41:44.505 --> 41:46.590
<i>Wait, what's all that noise?
Where are you?</i>

41:46.590 --> 41:47.799
Sounds like someone's singing.

41:47.799 --> 41:50.427
Wh-- No, I'm sorry.
I'm at a pub with Beard and Henry.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.471
Why? Is it too loud?
I can step away further if that helps.

41:52.471 --> 41:53.680
No, it's fine.

41:55.599 --> 41:56.600
Where were we?

41:56.600 --> 41:58.143
You think I'm nuts.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.105
Thanks, Michael.

42:07.194 --> 42:08.445
So, you like The Beatles, huh?

42:10.197 --> 42:11.240
Why is that?

42:12.366 --> 42:13.575
'Cause my dad does.

42:19.998 --> 42:21.625
You know what this song's about?

42:23.210 --> 42:24.628
Someone named Jude.

42:25.128 --> 42:28.048
Not just someone. A little boy named Jude.

42:30.092 --> 42:33.929
And one day his mom and dad decided
to break up. You know, get divorced.

42:35.389 --> 42:37.140
And that made Jude real, real sad.

42:39.268 --> 42:42.437
Now, Jude's dad had a best friend,

42:43.522 --> 42:48.402
and that best friend was real worried
about Jude and all his sad feelings.

42:48.944 --> 42:50.529
So he wrote him this song,

42:51.363 --> 42:54.533
hoping that, well, the words might
help him somewhere down the road.

42:55.325 --> 42:56.910
The long and winding road?

43:19.933 --> 43:21.018
Hey, Henry.

43:21.018 --> 43:24.646
You have a great mom and dad,
and they love you tons,

43:24.646 --> 43:26.607
even though it's weird
they live in different countries.

43:28.442 --> 43:32.154
And I know right now
it feels like you're in a sad song.

43:33.363 --> 43:35.032
But you, young man,

43:35.616 --> 43:39.953
you have the power to take a sad song
and make it better.

43:40.662 --> 43:41.705
I like that.

43:41.705 --> 43:43.207
Yeah, me too.

43:43.999 --> 43:45.751
But you know what the best thing
about this song is?

43:45.751 --> 43:47.211
What?

43:47.878 --> 43:49.004
This!

43:57.846 --> 44:02.351
Enjoy yourself, laddie!
Come on! Fucking sing it!

44:04.228 --> 44:06.605
<i>You know, Ted,
I'm so curious about something.</i>

44:06.605 --> 44:09.316
Why didn't you ever
take Michelle to Paris yourself?

44:09.316 --> 44:12.528
Well, I wanted to. I mean, you know,
we were too broke to go on our honeymoon.

44:12.528 --> 44:14.488
And then, well, we both got busy.

44:14.488 --> 44:18.700
And then we had Henry, and I just--
I always thought we'd have more time.

44:19.826 --> 44:20.827
Ted, I'm sorry.

44:20.827 --> 44:21.995
Thank you.

44:22.496 --> 44:27.501
But seriously, who gives a flying fuck
if Michelle gets engaged?

44:28.794 --> 44:31.547
That time in your relationship with her
has passed,

44:31.547 --> 44:33.549
<i>but your time with Henry hasn't.</i>

44:34.550 --> 44:37.636
You need to stop letting yesterday
get in the way of today, Ted.

44:37.636 --> 44:39.513
Well, I don't think
he's singing "Yesterday."

44:39.513 --> 44:40.514
Ted.

44:40.514 --> 44:42.224
No, I know. I'm just joking.

44:43.475 --> 44:45.894
- And you're right.
- Of course, I'm right. I'm always right.

44:46.562 --> 44:49.022
Now, for the love of God,
will you get back to that pub

44:49.022 --> 44:51.024
and sing "Hey Jude" with your boy?

44:51.024 --> 44:52.860
Mercy buckets, Boss.

44:52.860 --> 44:54.945
<i>De rien,</i> Coach Lasso.

45:42.117 --> 45:43.118
Thank you.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.792
Yeah. Uh-huh.

45:51.752 --> 45:53.086
No, I agree. It's much better.

45:54.171 --> 45:55.172
Thank you, George.

45:56.548 --> 45:58.258
Okay, so, good news.

45:58.258 --> 46:01.011
We've got a much more toned-down
version of the statement.

46:01.011 --> 46:02.846
The last one was so shit.

46:03.639 --> 46:04.640
Great.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.476
<i>I was once broken up with
by a guy's doorman.</i>

46:08.060 --> 46:12.397
<i>I'm sorry, Ms. Hobbes,
Jonathan won't be coming down. Ever.</i>

46:12.397 --> 46:13.482
Hey.

46:14.900 --> 46:18.904
I know it's lame.
But it will help, believe me.

46:20.489 --> 46:22.991
Before, when you said
that you were gonna take care of this,

46:22.991 --> 46:25.244
I thought that meant you were
gonna get the video taken down

46:25.244 --> 46:28.080
- or something like that.
- We tried. It's the fucking Internet.

46:28.664 --> 46:31.667
Making this statement
is taking care of it now.

46:33.377 --> 46:35.045
By having me make an apology?

46:36.088 --> 46:37.339
Yes.

46:39.341 --> 46:40.926
Please just do it.

46:42.761 --> 46:46.473
Sorry, but it's not a great look
when the person I'm seeing,

46:46.473 --> 46:49.810
whose company I fund, has a porno online.

46:49.810 --> 46:51.186
A porno?

46:51.186 --> 46:55.065
You know what I mean. We're just--
We're limiting the damage. Okay?

46:56.275 --> 46:57.776
Jack, I'm not doing it.

46:58.569 --> 47:02.322
This video being leaked is not my fault.
But for some reason, you think it is.

47:02.322 --> 47:05.576
Well, maybe, I don't know--
maybe you shouldn't have made the video

47:05.576 --> 47:06.952
in the first place.

47:07.911 --> 47:09.997
It's certainly not something
to be proud of, Keeley.

47:11.748 --> 47:13.584
I don't regret making that video.

47:15.169 --> 47:17.129
And I don't regret sending it.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.387
Are there more out there?

47:30.267 --> 47:32.936
I don't know.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.699
- What are you doing?
- I think I should go.

47:49.286 --> 47:50.454
Are you coming back?

47:54.249 --> 47:55.250
I don't know.

48:04.176 --> 48:05.219
Right.

48:12.518 --> 48:13.894
Do you want to go out and celebrate?

48:14.895 --> 48:16.063
Celebrate what?

48:16.855 --> 48:19.191
- Didn't you win today?
- Oh, yeah. But...

48:19.691 --> 48:22.236
No. That's okay though.

48:22.236 --> 48:24.321
Already working on the next one, so...

48:38.293 --> 48:40.295
You should enjoy your victories.

48:51.014 --> 48:52.182
It looks like they did.

49:02.901 --> 49:03.902
There it is.

49:04.736 --> 49:05.737
What?

49:06.655 --> 49:07.823
I love your smile.

49:09.449 --> 49:10.909
I like to see my boyfriend happy.

49:13.036 --> 49:14.079
Boyfriend.

49:17.082 --> 49:18.417
Yeah.

49:18.417 --> 49:19.751
If you're into labels.

49:20.335 --> 49:22.212
Yeah. No, I'm into labels. Sure.

49:22.212 --> 49:23.922
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:26.258 --> 49:28.135
- "This is Jade. She's my girlfriend."
- Yeah?

49:28.135 --> 49:29.803
Sounds good, doesn't it?

49:30.554 --> 49:31.805
"Nate. That's my boyfriend."

49:31.805 --> 49:34.808
- Nate's your boyfriend?
- Yeah. Have you met him? He's amazing.

49:34.808 --> 49:36.101
Thank you very much.

49:57.706 --> 49:58.582
Jamie.

49:58.582 --> 50:00.334
- Hey.
- Hi.

50:00.334 --> 50:02.294
So, I'm sorry just to drop in on you.
I just--

50:03.378 --> 50:05.005
- I was nervous to text you. I--
- Yeah.

50:05.005 --> 50:07.007
I mean, like,
you and everyone in my family.

50:07.674 --> 50:09.051
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

50:09.051 --> 50:11.303
Well, I just-- I wanted to check in
on you. See how you're doing.

50:11.303 --> 50:15.098
It's just so fucking shit, all of this.

50:16.683 --> 50:17.684
Thanks, Jamie.

50:19.019 --> 50:22.314
Yeah, doing all right.

50:22.314 --> 50:23.482
Yeah?

50:23.482 --> 50:24.650
That's good.

50:25.317 --> 50:28.487
And I also-- I just--
I wanted to apologize.

50:28.487 --> 50:30.531
- No, you don't have to do that.
- No, I do. Oh, no, I do.

50:30.531 --> 50:32.241
- I do.
- Jamie, this is not your fault.

50:32.241 --> 50:35.285
No, it is my fault.
And let me just-- I just need to tell you.

50:35.285 --> 50:37.704
I deleted it off my phone
way back when we broke up.

50:37.704 --> 50:39.414
I deleted everything.

50:39.414 --> 50:42.668
I mean, not straightaway,
'cause I did think that you and me

50:42.668 --> 50:44.294
was maybe gonna get back together again.

50:44.294 --> 50:49.383
But then you started going out with Roy,
and that's when I deleted most of it.

50:49.383 --> 50:51.051
Well, like, half.

50:51.969 --> 50:54.054
But that was mostly out of anger,
to be honest.

50:54.054 --> 50:57.599
Because, well, I think--

50:57.599 --> 51:00.561
I thought the only reason that the two of
you was going out was to make me jealous.

51:00.561 --> 51:01.895
But...

51:03.814 --> 51:08.402
Then I saw it was real,
and then I got rid of it all.

51:09.903 --> 51:12.656
I just forgot about the fucking emails.

51:13.740 --> 51:15.409
It's so stupid.
I should have been more careful.

51:15.409 --> 51:17.536
I should have picked
a stronger password or something.

51:17.536 --> 51:18.620
Oh, no.

51:19.162 --> 51:21.373
Don't tell me your password
was "password," Jamie.

51:22.165 --> 51:23.000
Yeah.

51:24.001 --> 51:27.254
Well, to be fair, I did think I'd fool 'em
'cause I spelled it with two S's.

51:32.509 --> 51:35.345
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Keeley.

51:38.390 --> 51:39.600
Really am.

51:44.104 --> 51:45.814
Thank you, Jamie.

51:52.279 --> 51:54.823
Excuse me, do you mind
taking a photo of me at the box?

51:54.823 --> 51:56.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Thanks.

51:57.326 --> 51:59.161
- All right.
- No.

51:59.161 --> 52:01.038
- It's like that. Yeah.
- All right.

52:01.038 --> 52:02.623
- It's all right.
- Take a good one.

52:03.457 --> 52:05.834
All right. Smile. There we go.

52:07.586 --> 52:10.172
All right, big guy. Time to roll.
Let's do it.

52:11.256 --> 52:13.258
- Bonjour!
- In here!

52:13.258 --> 52:14.968
Hi, kiddo.

52:15.719 --> 52:16.595
Mom!

52:16.595 --> 52:19.598
I missed you.
Did you have fun with your dad?

52:19.598 --> 52:21.808
Yeah. He's gonna buy me a drum kit.

52:22.976 --> 52:24.311
- Is he really?
- W--

52:27.523 --> 52:29.233
You know what? I love you, buddy.

52:29.233 --> 52:30.359
I love you too, Dad.

52:30.359 --> 52:32.194
All right, go on. Get outta here.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.281
I don't know where he gets these ideas.

52:37.699 --> 52:39.618
Hey, don't forget this thing.

52:43.163 --> 52:44.206
What are you doing?

52:45.541 --> 52:48.168
You-- Sorry, I was screwing around.

52:48.168 --> 52:49.378
Okay.

52:51.755 --> 52:52.798
How was Paris?

52:54.550 --> 52:55.592
It was all right.

52:56.343 --> 52:59.263
Yeah. Well, that's what it's known for.
City of all rights.

53:00.597 --> 53:01.890
Come on, Mom!

53:02.599 --> 53:03.600
It was good seeing you.

53:04.351 --> 53:05.394
Good seeing you too.

53:06.687 --> 53:09.314
You know, Dave Grohl learned
to play drums on pillows.

53:09.314 --> 53:10.399
I'm coming!

53:26.123 --> 53:27.708
There he is. Huh?
