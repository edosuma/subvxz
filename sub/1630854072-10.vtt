WEBVTT

01:42.101 --> 01:43.478
The Basilisk's down!

01:43.561 --> 01:45.730
What's he got equipped?!
This wasn't in the brief!

01:45.814 --> 01:47.232
The fixer fed us false info!

01:47.315 --> 01:49.734
-We're done for…
-Call for back-up!

01:49.818 --> 01:50.985
He's running!

01:51.069 --> 01:52.737
He's headed for Night City.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.074
Don't let Arasaka
take back the cyberskeleton!

01:57.951 --> 01:59.452
So? Where we headed?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.495
Arasaka!

02:00.578 --> 02:02.580
Arasaka… City Center?!

02:02.664 --> 02:03.498
Yeah!

02:03.581 --> 02:05.125
Why Arasaka?!

02:05.208 --> 02:06.918
We're saving Lucy!

02:07.001 --> 02:09.212
Why's she with Arasaka?!

02:09.295 --> 02:13.800
Faraday said she's part
of his deal with them…

02:15.218 --> 02:17.137
I gotta close my eyes a bit…

02:17.220 --> 02:21.724
Again?! Shit, the meds
are wearing off faster…

02:23.017 --> 02:25.228
We've got some Militech company.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.897
Shake them off! David's benched for five.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.940
What?!

02:29.023 --> 02:30.233
-Now?!
-Yeah.

02:30.316 --> 02:34.362
Fine. Five minutes? I'll buy him a nap.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.909
Take the front!

02:39.993 --> 02:42.996
Alrighty, let's get this show on the road!

03:02.473 --> 03:04.100
Way to go, old man!

03:07.270 --> 03:08.438
Nice going!

03:09.689 --> 03:12.191
Shit, another swarm ahead!

03:12.275 --> 03:13.526
Arasaka's up next!

03:13.610 --> 03:16.321
Okie-dokie! Barrel on through!

03:16.404 --> 03:19.282
Not against that number.
We're getting off.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.200
What?! Come on!

03:21.284 --> 03:23.703
Militech's forces are nearly gone.

03:24.287 --> 03:28.499
The target's entered Night City
and our recovery team's on him.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.169
This is going to be hell to cover up…

03:31.252 --> 03:35.715
This is what we get
for putting all our chips on a fixer…

03:35.798 --> 03:41.429
According to path calculations, there's
a 74% chance that he's headed here.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.598
Here? Why?

03:43.681 --> 03:48.519
Can't say. He shouldn't even
know that we're involved.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.314
Damn. Get in contact
with internal security.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.692
Ma'am? The higher ups will be alerted.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.862
Better to stir up a storm
and hide in the dust.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.616
Damn it, Faraday…
Nothing is going according to plan.

04:01.699 --> 04:08.122
Imagine me, a lowly street fixer, meeting
with Arasaka intel inside their own tower.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.876
It's quite the breakthrough,
wouldn't you say?

04:13.336 --> 04:17.507
All who live in this city
should aspire to climb high.

04:17.590 --> 04:20.468
This is but a stepping stone on my way up.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.317
What am I doing…

06:01.611 --> 06:02.612
End of the line!

06:02.695 --> 06:04.280
Wakey, wakey David!

06:04.864 --> 06:06.824
Don't ask where these come from.

06:06.908 --> 06:10.536
Nine times the dosage
of those military-issued meds.

06:10.620 --> 06:17.418
It'll force you to stay sane,
but the side effects'll stack.

06:17.502 --> 06:22.799
By the time ya hit the last vial…

06:23.716 --> 06:25.885
<i>Whatever's left of ya, Davey…</i>

06:27.386 --> 06:31.474
<i>You'll slingshot the other way,</i>
<i>straight over the edge.</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:51.661
Woo-hoo!

06:57.667 --> 07:00.795
Damn. They just keep coming!

07:15.935 --> 07:17.812
Oh shit!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.373
<i>I want you to work hard, rise up,</i>

07:37.457 --> 07:41.627
and get to the top floor of Arasaka Tower!

07:42.211 --> 07:44.630
I know you got it in you, Dee.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.803
Mom!

07:51.345 --> 07:57.727
Thanks, mom. I'll do it.
To the top floor of Arasaka Tower…

07:59.395 --> 08:00.813
Okay.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.274
Let's go. All the way to the top.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.903
I got special meds from Doc.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.823
If I look like I'm losing it,
I need you to shoot me up…

08:10.907 --> 08:13.534
So I can keep it together.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.706
I don't think the meds'll
work on him anymore.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.625
Seriously? What do we do?

08:20.708 --> 08:23.794
We're going to 'Saka!
There's no other option.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.422
But with David like that?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.924
We need Lucy!

08:28.007 --> 08:29.425
What?

08:29.509 --> 08:33.804
She's… the only one
that might be able to bring him back.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.058
I can't think of anyone else that could!

08:42.396 --> 08:44.941
I'm not doing any more jobs for you.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.067
I see…

08:46.901 --> 08:48.569
I understand.

08:50.655 --> 08:57.078
My contract stipulates that I get rid of
anyone who knows about the cyberskeleton.

08:57.161 --> 09:00.957
No exceptions… Not even for you.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.710
Go! After her!

09:05.503 --> 09:08.714
We're getting closer to
the Tower! What's our plan?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.967
When do we ever have a plan?!

09:12.301 --> 09:14.095
David! Do that thing again!

09:16.180 --> 09:17.932
Woo-hoo!

09:19.225 --> 09:22.603
Die! Have some of this!

09:27.733 --> 09:31.571
Persistent bastards!
Cut us a break already!

09:36.826 --> 09:37.660
We lose them?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.453
Most of 'em!

09:40.288 --> 09:42.206
MaxTac!

09:44.584 --> 09:46.085
They sent three AVs?!

09:46.168 --> 09:48.796
They flagged him as a cyberpsycho already?

09:48.879 --> 09:53.467
We're all fucked
if David doesn't get his shit together!

09:53.551 --> 09:55.386
You don't say!

09:55.469 --> 10:01.726
MaxTac was dispatched to dispose of him
as a cyberpsychosis case.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.311
What a nightmare…

10:03.394 --> 10:06.397
This has grown far beyond
our original means.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.319
The boy. We need to stop him
before he makes matters worse.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.904
It's impossible. No one can stop him.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.741
We must wait
for the implant to wear him down.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.410
There is one person who can.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.620
Who?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.371
Adam Smasher.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.415
Y-You're joking.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.918
No, though I'd rather not
have had it come to this.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.713
But even if you summon him now…

10:30.796 --> 10:32.340
That's not a problem.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.508
He's already here.

10:35.301 --> 10:40.598
The cyberskeleton
was originally designed for him.

10:40.681 --> 10:43.517
It's poetic that he should be
the one to end it.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.812
Drop out. Get gone.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.856
<i>Afraid of getting caught?</i>

10:48.939 --> 10:50.816
<i>'Cause I sure ain't.</i>

10:56.656 --> 10:59.825
Fuck you, MaxTac! Come and get us!

11:02.912 --> 11:05.289
What the hell? Hey! Shit!

11:05.373 --> 11:07.291
You're just gonna leave us here?!

11:07.375 --> 11:09.543
Mom!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.596
Is he even human?

11:20.679 --> 11:21.931
Keep shooting!

11:22.014 --> 11:24.392
Hold fire! New orders from Arasaka.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.185
Code A.S. We're retreating.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.103
What?

11:31.273 --> 11:33.859
Rebecca… How many vials are left?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.403
Just one more.

11:36.695 --> 11:38.614
Finally at the end of the rope…

11:40.908 --> 11:41.826
Kiwi?!

11:41.909 --> 11:44.870
Huh?! Two-timing bitch!
I'll fucking kill you!

12:37.131 --> 12:40.801
<i>…Faraday's turn to be betrayed now.</i>

12:51.896 --> 12:53.814
Kiwi has been disposed of.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.566
Nasty business…

13:04.617 --> 13:05.451
Hey!

13:10.539 --> 13:12.041
It can't be… David?!

13:21.717 --> 13:23.636
Don't stop till we reach the loading dock!

13:24.220 --> 13:28.265
Faraday will soon be
arriving with the runner.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.602
As I thought,
Martinez must be after our fixer, not us.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.729
I'll order the AV to turn around.

13:33.812 --> 13:38.984
No, keep them on course for the dock.
You'll meet them there.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.403
<i>I'll</i> meet them?

13:41.987 --> 13:47.284
Someone's going to have to
take the fall for all this mess,

13:47.368 --> 13:49.912
and that person is not me.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.163
Do you understand?

13:51.789 --> 13:57.211
Make sure that mangy fixer
never makes it past the loading dock.

14:00.297 --> 14:05.928
You're up against the cyberskeleton.
Think you might have some fun, Smasher?

14:06.011 --> 14:11.308
It's a child's toy
reliant on antigrav training wheels…

14:11.392 --> 14:13.310
Not even worth my time.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.067
Kill him!

14:20.150 --> 14:21.569
Fire!

14:21.652 --> 14:22.945
Where is he?!

14:23.028 --> 14:24.321
No one's there!

14:28.409 --> 14:29.410
<i>Mom…</i>

14:30.369 --> 14:33.789
Look, I'm at the top of Arasaka Tower.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.795
Well, this is the last one, Doc…

14:39.879 --> 14:46.510
Once you've gone off the edge,
there's no coming back.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.555
Doesn't matter how special you are.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.891
But that's why I gotta go.

14:51.974 --> 14:55.686
'Cause I've got nothing left now.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.487
Seems to me like someone
didn't follow the plan, Faraday.

15:05.571 --> 15:10.492
I brought the girl alive. I believe
our agreed price was one million?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.704
We don't deal with dogs
that run off-leash.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.750
Do you know what happens to
the ones that leave their cages?

15:17.833 --> 15:22.755
Is that a threat? Don't you need
the data inside this cranium?

15:22.838 --> 15:27.509
I can't allow you to take
a single step further in this building.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.012
I would say that's very unwise.

15:30.095 --> 15:36.018
With all the information I have,
it'd be a loss not to keep me on payroll.

15:36.101 --> 15:40.731
Leave the girl and get out.
We'll send the payment as agreed.

15:40.814 --> 15:47.071
We have no further use for you if you
can't give us data on the cyberskeleton…

15:54.703 --> 15:56.121
Lucy…

15:56.205 --> 15:57.915
David…

16:21.105 --> 16:22.314
See that?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.109
I even delivered the cyberskeleton…

16:31.490 --> 16:34.827
You aren't gonna die that easily.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.914
Adam Smasher?!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.499
Kill him!

16:40.582 --> 16:42.084
Who the fuck are you?

16:42.167 --> 16:44.920
You're a merc! Do your fucking job!

16:45.004 --> 16:47.923
My business is with the kid.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.967
Adam Smasher?

16:50.050 --> 16:54.722
So you're Adam Smasher?
Boogeyman of legend?

16:55.305 --> 17:00.436
You're packing some heavy artillery
for your size there, cyberpunk.

17:00.519 --> 17:03.480
Impressive that you're still able to talk.

17:03.564 --> 17:08.193
Likewise, choom.
Heard you went no organic, full cyborg.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.237
You still got a brain in there?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.197
You could say I'm special.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.616
Well so the fuck am I!

17:14.700 --> 17:16.493
That a joke?

17:18.662 --> 17:20.122
Trauma Team!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.376
Thank god…

17:27.337 --> 17:30.507
Can you afford to be distracted?

18:01.830 --> 18:05.042
David! David, can you hear me?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.752
It's me, Lucy!

18:07.336 --> 18:11.256
David, come back to me! Come back…

18:24.228 --> 18:25.771
Lucy…

18:27.022 --> 18:28.774
David…

18:29.733 --> 18:31.485
You installed it.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.031
I knew you would…

18:36.615 --> 18:39.493
And I knew you would die if you did.

18:39.576 --> 18:44.915
I didn't want any of this.
Didn't want you to die…

18:45.499 --> 18:51.296
This is the only way I could
protect you from this city.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.341
I couldn't save mom or Maine,

18:54.424 --> 18:57.177
but I wanted to save you.

18:59.763 --> 19:06.687
But you never had to save me.
All I ever wanted was for you to live.

19:06.770 --> 19:11.400
I don't matter.
I don't have anything left.

19:11.483 --> 19:17.114
You have a dream.
I need you to see it through for me.

19:17.197 --> 19:21.451
That's my dream.
Everything else doesn't matter.

19:45.642 --> 19:48.729
When do you think
those Ara-suckers will give up?

19:48.812 --> 19:52.524
NCPD's out there with them.
It's not gonna be for a while.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.776
Man, I'm almost out of ammo…

20:00.282 --> 20:01.450
We made it.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.286
Took long enough, gonkbrain.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.206
Shut the fuck up!

20:07.289 --> 20:10.334
Falco. Got a favor to ask you.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.294
Alright, time to retreat!

20:13.378 --> 20:14.963
Glad you're back safe.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.342
For David's sake, I mean.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.639
We're having a moment--

20:39.071 --> 20:40.489
Rebecca!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.451
Damn you…

20:52.501 --> 20:54.795
You have a Sandevistan?!

20:54.878 --> 20:56.922
It's a rudimentary implant.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.299
I'm the one you're after!

20:59.383 --> 21:03.595
All the same meat to me.
I'll slaughter each and every one of you.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.223
Not if I kill you first!

21:09.893 --> 21:12.145
Out of meds?

21:14.398 --> 21:17.192
Right on schedule, I'd say.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.318
David!

21:26.702 --> 21:27.786
What?!

21:30.580 --> 21:34.376
Falco… David's still back there…

21:34.459 --> 21:35.502
Falco!

21:35.585 --> 21:39.131
None leave the slaughterhouse alive.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.134
Distracted much?

21:42.217 --> 21:43.885
You…

21:43.969 --> 21:49.016
Who are <i>you</i>… to challenge <i>me</i>…

21:49.599 --> 21:53.770
When you can't even stand
without your antigrav crutches?

21:54.604 --> 21:57.774
Think you're special
'cause you're scrappy?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.362
Don't make me laugh!

22:05.991 --> 22:07.993
Falco! Turn back…

22:08.076 --> 22:08.910
No.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.538
David asked me.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.292
If I go back now…
he'd have died for nothing.

22:15.375 --> 22:18.295
I've got the commission money.

22:18.378 --> 22:21.048
He wants it split between us.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.051
He also told me to tell ya…

22:25.427 --> 22:29.056
<i>Sorry. Wish we could go</i>
<i>to the moon together.</i>

23:11.056 --> 23:13.725
I had fun after all.

23:14.309 --> 23:18.730
You know, you could prove
an interesting construct.

23:19.397 --> 23:23.360
Like I… give a shit…

23:24.319 --> 23:27.405
Alright. Well then.

23:56.726 --> 24:00.021
<i>Welcome to the tour of the moon!</i>

24:00.105 --> 24:05.360
<i>Experience lunar gravity</i>
<i>like nothing you've seen on a BD…</i>

24:26.381 --> 24:28.633
Whoa! Check this!

24:29.217 --> 24:31.386
I can feel the fucking sun!
