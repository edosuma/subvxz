WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:05.918
Alright, you've got
veggie lasagna

00:06.006 --> 00:07.833
and Turkey chili for dinners.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.010
And there's plenty of
yogurt cups and carrot sticks

00:10.097 --> 00:13.013
in case you want to
get your snack on.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.275
You're gonna be gone
for three days.

00:14.362 --> 00:16.929
What if I run out of food?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.106
Well, then you'll starve
and die, but

00:19.193 --> 00:22.152
I'm sure somebody'll call me.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.719
Why do you have to go,
can't someone else

00:23.806 --> 00:25.938
go to that
stupid teacher conference?

00:26.026 --> 00:29.594
No, because I'm the stupid
teacher that volunteered for it.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.509
Besides, I'm not going
to Mardi Gras.

00:31.596 --> 00:35.687
I'm headed to the honest Abe's
motor lodge in Springfield.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.733
- Does it have a pool?
- I don't know, maybe.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.387
I mean, they do have a hot tub,
but I always think

00:39.474 --> 00:43.260
drunk people pee in those.
I know I do.

00:43.347 --> 00:44.870
What am I supposed to do
while you're gone?

00:44.957 --> 00:47.395
Anything. Your wife's
going out of town, fella.

00:47.482 --> 00:51.181
- Whoop it up.
- Uh, I don't whoop.

00:51.268 --> 00:52.748
I wasn't a whooper
when I was single.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.881
I got married
because I couldn't whoop.

00:55.968 --> 00:59.450
Boy, I sure did my fair share
of whooping. Ay-ay-ay.

00:59.537 --> 01:02.453
Huh. But, uh,
those days are gone

01:02.540 --> 01:05.152
and those pictures
have been cut up and burned.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.155
Promise you'll call me
every day

01:08.242 --> 01:09.591
so that I can
at least hear your voice.

01:09.678 --> 01:11.984
Every morning when I wake up
and when I go to bed.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.421
Seriously.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.379
Oh, and I'll text you
from the hot tub.

01:17.381 --> 01:20.123
Wait. Somebody has totally lost
his funny bone this morning.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.473
You know what, go,
but when you come home

01:22.560 --> 01:24.736
and you don't recognize me,
I'll be the frail old man

01:24.823 --> 01:28.349
that's bearded and mumbling
to himself in the basement.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.264
You're gonna be fine,
just promise me

01:30.351 --> 01:31.439
you're gonna eat the food
that I gave you

01:31.526 --> 01:33.093
and not go on a junk food binge.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.920
If you promise me
you'll take care of yourself

01:35.007 --> 01:37.488
and not run off with some
PE teacher from Rockford.

01:38.663 --> 01:41.231
Deal. No Big Mac for you.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.972
And no Big Mac for me.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.281
I'm gonna go finish packing.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.891
Hey, do you still have that
little flask

01:48.978 --> 01:51.415
I got you two Christmases ago?

01:51.502 --> 01:53.896
Never mind, never mind.

01:53.983 --> 01:59.336
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:59.423 --> 02:02.513
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:12.132 --> 02:14.656
[instrumental music]

02:17.093 --> 02:18.399
[sighs heavily]

02:19.922 --> 02:21.489
Man, you better snap out of it.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.055
'Cause I'm not gonna have you
droopy doggin' it

02:23.143 --> 02:25.449
for the next three days.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.321
Leave me alone, Carl.
I miss my wife.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.236
Well, maybe instead of
pining like a little baby

02:29.323 --> 02:31.499
you should take this time to
reconnect with your best friend.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.241
Are you kidding? We spend
40 hours a week together.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.720
That's our
professional 'relationship

02:35.807 --> 02:37.853
not us sharing details
about our personal life.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.637
So, you fretting to me
for an hour

02:39.724 --> 02:41.161
about your alleged
shrinking testicle

02:41.248 --> 02:44.120
is considered
by-the-book police work?

02:44.207 --> 02:45.643
Look, how are you gonna be
able to watch my back

02:45.730 --> 02:47.210
if you don't know
what's going on in my head?

02:47.297 --> 02:48.733
I'd probably be more likely
to take a bullet

02:48.820 --> 02:50.953
for you if I didn't.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.694
Now we know that. See?

02:52.781 --> 02:53.869
We haven't had one of these
heart-to-hearts

02:53.956 --> 02:55.349
for as long as I can remember.

02:55.436 --> 02:56.785
Are you kidding me,
I've been hearing

02:56.872 --> 02:58.961
about your small ball theory
since I got you that

02:59.048 --> 03:01.268
pocket tape measure.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.834
You know, I'm starting to think
it's got something

03:02.921 --> 03:04.271
to do with the weather.

03:04.358 --> 03:07.056
You know, barometric pressure.

03:07.143 --> 03:08.405
Every time a cloud rolls in

03:08.492 --> 03:12.235
I go from 18.1 centimeters
to 17.5.

03:12.322 --> 03:14.716
Are we all caught up now?
'Cause I'm gonna text my wife.

03:14.803 --> 03:17.327
Hey. How about tonight, you
and I go out and grab a beer

03:17.414 --> 03:19.503
and rekindle the embers
of our friendship.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.419
Come home, now.

03:22.506 --> 03:25.205
You could be my wingman, nothing
melts a single lady's heart

03:25.292 --> 03:27.555
like seeing a caring friend
console his grieving buddy

03:27.642 --> 03:29.774
over the tragic death
of his wife.

03:29.861 --> 03:32.603
I'm not gonna let you
say my wife's dead.

03:32.690 --> 03:33.691
It's bad enough
I let you take me

03:33.778 --> 03:36.564
to a strip joint
in a wheelchair.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.870
We don't need to be specific
about her whereabouts.

03:38.957 --> 03:42.091
She's gone, you're sad,
I'm horny.

03:42.178 --> 03:45.399
Well, all of those things
are true.

03:50.142 --> 03:52.406
Damn it, Moranto,
what are you doing down here?

03:52.493 --> 03:54.451
And why does it smell
like a tire fire?

03:54.538 --> 03:56.192
I'm tumble drying my car mats.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.239
Joyce is going nuts
with this spring cleaning thing.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.111
That dryer is not built
to handle car mats.

04:02.198 --> 04:05.288
It can handle your underwear.
And talk about burnt tire smell.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.726
It's like ringside at NASCAR.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.859
Just get your crap
and get out of here.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.991
What are you doing home anyway?
Your wife's out of town.

04:13.078 --> 04:16.168
You should be out having fun.
Go to a strip club or something.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.562
I don't like doing anything
without Mol. It's not the same.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.477
Well, you certainly
have to be more gentlemanly

04:20.564 --> 04:21.609
during the lap dances.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.132
And I don't know
about your wife

04:23.219 --> 04:25.917
but Joyce has a strict
no motor-boating rule.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.357
I am gonna eat one of
the prepared dinners she left me

04:30.444 --> 04:34.317
go to bed at 8:30, and smell her
pillow till I fall asleep.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.493
You disgust me.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.540
You're a disgrace
to husband's everywhere.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.976
Why? Because when my wife's
out of town

04:41.063 --> 04:42.238
I don't want to give some
stripper a buck

04:42.325 --> 04:43.892
to shake her behind in my face?

04:43.979 --> 04:45.894
Trust me, the ones
that'll do it for a buck

04:45.981 --> 04:48.636
you don't want their behinds
in your face.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.551
How much would it cost
for me to see your behind

04:50.638 --> 04:52.379
walking up those stairs?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.859
Look, if you don't
take advantage of these

04:54.946 --> 04:57.166
three days of freedom,
you will regret it

04:57.253 --> 04:58.515
for the rest of your life.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.170
Hey, I love my wife
and I miss her.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.999
That's because you're still
basking in the early bloom

05:04.086 --> 05:07.089
but one day,
in the not so distant future

05:07.176 --> 05:10.135
you will find yourself
standing in the Wisconsin Dells

05:10.222 --> 05:12.312
wearing fanny packs and visors

05:12.399 --> 05:14.314
arguing about
where to eat lunch.

05:16.577 --> 05:17.969
Oh, God.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.364
And as you try to decide
between Olive Garden

05:21.451 --> 05:24.933
or jumping in front of a bus

05:25.020 --> 05:27.675
you will regret
not having taken advantage

05:27.762 --> 05:31.069
of these precious days
of sweet freedom.

05:32.897 --> 05:37.859
Well, "Re-Animator" is playing
at the Skokie Fourplex

05:37.946 --> 05:41.384
and their hot butter pump
is self-serve and unmonitored.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.562
There you go.
Baby steps.

05:45.649 --> 05:50.045
Whatever you want to do.
The point is to live like a man.

05:50.132 --> 05:53.353
Vince, what the hell
are you doing down here?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.878
I'm giving my car mats
a little spring spruce, my dear.

05:56.965 --> 05:59.402
Remember you told me
they smell like feet?

05:59.489 --> 06:01.230
Well, chop-chop, hairball.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.579
Come on,
you got to finish your chores

06:02.666 --> 06:04.364
and then take me
to the Olive Garden.

06:06.757 --> 06:10.326
Spread your wings and fly,
little bird, for all of us.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.501
[Joyce]
'Vince!'

06:17.159 --> 06:19.857
Hey, man. Could you please
try to look more sad?

06:19.944 --> 06:21.119
Just put some hot sauce
in your eyes

06:21.206 --> 06:22.469
or pluck out a nose hair,
or something.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.210
You just lost your wife,
for God sakes.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.169
Well, let's just
cut to the chase

06:27.256 --> 06:29.258
and I'll tell you exactly
what these ladies are thinking.

06:29.345 --> 06:32.740
No, no and hell no.

06:32.827 --> 06:34.437
Can we please
just go to a movie?

06:34.524 --> 06:36.961
Look, we can't carry on
a conversation in a movie.

06:37.048 --> 06:38.920
And this is our time
to reconnect.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.138
Man, me and you.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.358
And to help you through this

06:42.445 --> 06:45.100
horrible, horrible
time of grief.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.711
Still wearing your ring.
It just breaks my heart.

06:47.798 --> 06:50.975
Will you...please stop
using me to meet women.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.064
Where's your $20 bill
on a string?

06:53.151 --> 06:55.589
Ah, I lost that
at a Payless shoe store.

06:55.676 --> 06:59.244
That woman had cat-like
reflexes. She earned it.

06:59.331 --> 07:01.638
Let's just finish our beers
and go home.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.640
Mm, not quite yet.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.164
James.
How's it going, man?

07:06.251 --> 07:08.340
Good.
It's Carl, right?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.560
Yeah, man.
I used to date your ex-wife.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.127
We're practically related.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.521
I think they call
that Spanish cousins.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.045
Right.
So, how you doing?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.655
How's it look like I'm doing?

07:18.742 --> 07:21.005
I'm wearing Hugo Boss,
drinking a Sam Adams. Boo-ya.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.226
It was good to see you again.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.663
Hey, so, um, hanging out in
a singles bar by yourself, huh?

07:26.750 --> 07:29.971
Tracing a kick to the curb, too?
What does that woman want?

07:30.058 --> 07:32.539
I mean, if two handsome studs
like us ain't good enough, then

07:32.626 --> 07:33.975
she might not even be
into dudes.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.237
You know what I'm talking about?

07:35.324 --> 07:38.588
I think
you know what I'm talking about.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.243
Actually, she's, uh, she's
out in the car waiting for me.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.419
Yeah, she had a craving
for pepper poppers.

07:43.506 --> 07:47.510
You know how it is
with pregnant women.

07:47.597 --> 07:50.818
- Pregnant?
- Boo-ya.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.210
Anyway, it was good
seeing you again, man.

07:52.297 --> 07:54.517
Yeah, good to see you, too.
Hey, hang on.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.779
How pregnant is she,
'cause, you know

07:55.866 --> 07:57.302
it hasn't been that long
since she and I--

07:57.389 --> 07:59.217
- It's not your baby.
- Alright, alright.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.785
Hey, well, you know,
just in case

08:01.872 --> 08:03.744
make sure he goes
to a good college.

08:10.751 --> 08:13.928
I'm happy for them.
I couldn't be happier.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.018
[sighs]

08:17.105 --> 08:19.150
Christina knew I wanted a kid.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.152
And now that man's
having my baby.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.806
Well, look at the bright side,
now you don't have to

08:22.893 --> 08:26.549
put parental controls
on your porn channels.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.377
It hurts so much.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.466
She broke my heart and all
I ever did was love her.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.425
- I loved her so much, Mike.
- You'll love again.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.340
Hey, maybe now's the time
to get that guinea pig

08:35.427 --> 08:37.560
you've been talking about.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.257
Man, my world is shattered.

08:39.344 --> 08:43.000
It's torn apart at the seams.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.524
The sandman's gonna
have to bring two bags

08:44.611 --> 08:46.787
to dam up my levee of tears.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.920
And a couple of melatonin and
maybe some nighty-night tea.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
Hey, I could always
clock you in the jaw

08:51.661 --> 08:53.271
with a fireplace log.

08:53.358 --> 08:54.446
You do whatever you want.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.971
I don't care
if I ever wake up again.

08:57.058 --> 08:59.060
There's no tomorrow.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.366
There's only yesterday.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.543
And the love that I once knew.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.805
[crying]

09:04.892 --> 09:06.763
[cell phone ringing]

09:06.850 --> 09:09.549
This is Molly.
I got to take this.

09:09.636 --> 09:13.901
Hi, sweetie.
Nothing, just missing you.

09:13.988 --> 09:16.294
She misses me, too.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.471
Everybody's got somebody but me.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.736
No, just Carl. I don't know,
he's upset about something.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.390
More importantly, how are you?

09:25.477 --> 09:27.567
Shh, she's telling me
about her day.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.226
[instrumental music]

09:37.054 --> 09:39.100
Vin, roll up these rugs.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.319
Victoria, get going
on those shelves.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.800
So, I'm gonna have to spend my
whole Saturday spring cleaning?

09:43.887 --> 09:47.151
You know this is my day
to read and reflect.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.762
Reflect on what?

09:48.849 --> 09:52.635
The fact that you didn't do crap
Monday through Friday?

09:52.722 --> 09:54.811
Did Molly call and say
she got my flowers?

09:54.898 --> 09:56.944
Where the hell
have you been, Romeo?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.815
You got to put up the screens
and clean the gutters.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.600
You got to be kidding,
I was up half the night

10:00.687 --> 10:02.732
with a colicky Carl,
I had to keep driving him around

10:02.819 --> 10:05.126
the block till he fell asleep.

10:05.213 --> 10:07.041
Quite whining,
I haven't even been to bed yet

10:07.128 --> 10:10.435
and my buzz wore off
about 40 minutes ago.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.786
If you're jonesing,
try huffing the pine cleaner.

10:12.873 --> 10:14.744
I'm seeing double
and I can't hear anything

10:14.831 --> 10:15.876
out of my left ear.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.315
I sure am hearing
a lot of bitching

10:20.402 --> 10:22.926
from people who live
in my house for free.

10:25.276 --> 10:28.671
The lady
makes a very good point.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.935
Vince, put on some work clothes,
and I'll grab a ladder

10:32.022 --> 10:33.154
and I'll meet you on the roof.

10:33.241 --> 10:34.938
That's more like it.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.331
I told you to fly

10:36.418 --> 10:37.680
but you had to come back,
didn't you?

10:37.767 --> 10:39.290
You big dodo bird.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.339
Ah! This is disgusting.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.471
Can you smell this?
Get over here and smell this.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.908
I can smell it from here.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.475
Just put it in the bag
and keep scooping.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.086
This isn't just rotten leaves.

10:52.173 --> 10:55.916
I'm telling you,
something died in these gutters.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.222
Probably just a dead squirrel
or a rat.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.616
No, this is bigger, more sour.

11:00.703 --> 11:03.271
It's like a rotting,
hobo midget.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.884
Ugh!
Maybe Santa lost a helper.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.061
What are we
doing up here anyway?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.716
This is women's work.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.761
Vince, we are better off.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.327
We've only been given one chore

11:16.414 --> 11:18.112
and we can stretch it out
as long as we want.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.418
Well, if I scoop up
a dwarf skull

11:20.505 --> 11:23.247
I'm jumping off this roof
and using you as my air bag.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.815
Let's just get it done.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.556
Then we can take turns
napping behind the chimney

11:27.643 --> 11:30.037
while the other one
waits lookout.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.169
First dead robin of the season.

11:33.954 --> 11:35.520
You gonna name it or bag it?

11:35.607 --> 11:37.348
If you're the one
who crapped on my Sebring

11:37.435 --> 11:39.350
I'll see you in hell.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.750
Geez. There's like ten years
of dusty farts in here.

11:52.233 --> 11:55.149
Mom, this silver polish
is making my eyes blurry

11:55.236 --> 11:57.412
a-and some of my hair's
falling out.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.415
Use it sparingly, they took
that stuff off the market.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.940
Why do kids always look under
the sink when they're thirsty?

12:04.027 --> 12:06.116
- I'll get that.
- Oh, no, you won't.

12:06.203 --> 12:08.597
I am not letting you anywhere
near an open door.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.382
You'll take off like that Jack
Russell we owned for two hours.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.257
Miss Flynn, I'm just here
to say goodbye to Mike

12:16.344 --> 12:17.737
before I leave town
to start a new life

12:17.824 --> 12:19.695
and try to mend
this broken heart.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.263
Well, don't get any tears
on the floor, I just waxed it.

12:24.352 --> 12:27.529
Hi, sweetie, just thought
I'd leave you a quick message

12:27.616 --> 12:29.749
to tell you
I found that Frisbee.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.665
Okay, that's it.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.364
Uh, hope you're having fun, too.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.367
Love you. Bye.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.936
Hey, we're not up here
to make phone calls, Gidget.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.720
Now bring that body bag over

12:44.807 --> 12:47.157
'cause I just found
another mummified rodent.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.550
Squirrel or rat?

12:49.812 --> 12:52.249
Ah-h.
My money's on possum.

12:53.860 --> 12:58.255
Based on the position
of his paws, it died scared.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.953
Looks like there was
definitely a struggle.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.911
Probably a feral cat
got ahold of it.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.348
Or a hungry, homeless dwarf.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.176
They'll eat anything.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.744
Did you watch that movie
with the crazy leprechaun again?

13:08.831 --> 13:11.573
You know, that's based
on a true story.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.402
- Hey.
- Carl, what are you doing?

13:14.489 --> 13:16.708
Ah, didn't feel right
leaving town without coming by

13:16.796 --> 13:17.753
giving you a big hug
and telling you

13:17.840 --> 13:18.885
how much you mean to me.

13:18.972 --> 13:22.018
- Uh-h.
- Where you going?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.454
I haven't decided yet.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.891
Someplace where I can
get a fresh start.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.370
Avoid Indiana.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.633
There's nothin' fresh
about the whole state.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.854
It's like these gutters,
but with legal fireworks.

13:31.941 --> 13:34.726
Carl, you're talking crazy.
Go home and get some sleep.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.077
Uh, no, my home is in the back
of that Chevrolet Blazer

13:37.164 --> 13:38.643
and my future lies
on that road ahead of me.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.297
Remember, stay on I-55

13:40.384 --> 13:43.910
'cause it loops
all the way around Indiana.

13:43.997 --> 13:46.173
This city's too small
and has too many memories.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.870
I see her reflection
in every shop window

13:47.957 --> 13:49.306
and every puddle on the street.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.787
Rat.

13:51.874 --> 13:56.139
I'm telling you, there's
something on this roof.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.098
That's a killing machine.

14:01.623 --> 14:04.495
I don't know why I ever
bought this damn piano.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.716
Neither of you girls can play
a tune to save your life.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.370
Well, you wouldn't
let us practice.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.328
Yeah.
'Cause you sounded awful.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.856
Like a burning cat
tangled in wind chimes.

14:18.814 --> 14:19.989
- I got it.
- Oh!

14:20.076 --> 14:22.165
Freeze. And don't try to run.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.559
I got your car keys
and your weed stash.

14:26.169 --> 14:28.389
Damn it.

14:28.476 --> 14:30.043
- What?
- Is Mike here?

14:30.130 --> 14:31.522
On the roof.

14:31.609 --> 14:33.785
And you are brave enough
to be inside the house?

14:36.571 --> 14:39.052
Carl, you can't just pack up
and move to a different state

14:39.139 --> 14:41.097
every time a woman
craps on your heart.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.578
Yeah. Sooner or later,
you'll run out of options

14:43.665 --> 14:46.146
and have to go
to Canada and turn homo.

14:47.321 --> 14:48.844
Happened to a buddy of mine.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.324
- Really?
- Yep.

14:50.411 --> 14:53.066
Owns a sweet little
B and B in Saskatoon.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.459
Warm chocolate chip cookie
on the nightstand

14:55.546 --> 14:57.374
every time you walk
into the room.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.550
- That sounds nice.
- It's lovely.

14:59.637 --> 15:02.466
Little rock garden out back.
You should take Molly.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.992
It's a romantic weekend
without equal.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.820
I'm quoting the brochure.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.300
Well, I can't stay in Chicago.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.693
Eventually, I'm gonna run
into Christina

15:11.780 --> 15:13.086
and she'll be holding a baby.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.566
Hey, as long as she's not
thrusting it at you

15:15.653 --> 15:17.481
saying, "It's your
problem now, daddy."

15:17.568 --> 15:19.614
Why do you think
I avoid Indiana?

15:21.181 --> 15:23.923
There you are, Carl.
I was so worried.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.273
Ah, he's fine.
Just a little upset.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.188
Needs to talk things out
with his friends.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.885
You came all the way over here
to check on me?

15:29.972 --> 15:32.192
Of course, you're like
a brother to me.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.367
A brother I would
not hesitate to sue

15:33.454 --> 15:35.064
if he skipped out on the rent.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.762
See, people care about you.
You can't just run away.

15:37.849 --> 15:38.938
It's the law.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.591
Eh, well,
how can I ever be happy

15:40.678 --> 15:43.725
while another man is living the
life I was supposed to live?

15:43.812 --> 15:45.553
I used to feel the same way

15:45.640 --> 15:49.209
about underwater explorer
Jacques Cousteau.

15:49.296 --> 15:51.472
- I love Jacques Cousteau.
- Right?

15:51.559 --> 15:55.171
How I envied
that red-capped bastard.

15:55.258 --> 15:57.913
While I was busting
my hump on land

15:58.000 --> 16:00.046
he was sailing the seven seas.

16:01.177 --> 16:03.136
He had that underwater sub, too.

16:03.223 --> 16:04.224
The Nautilus.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.834
Get you eyeball to eyeball

16:05.921 --> 16:08.097
with the legendary giant squid.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.405
They have put men on the moon

16:11.492 --> 16:14.799
but so much of the deep sea
is unexplored and unknown.

16:14.886 --> 16:18.151
Right? I mean,
anything could be down there.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.110
It's like these gutters.

16:23.939 --> 16:27.551
Hey, look. Found a bunch
of your grandma's old silver.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.423
Since you've built up
a tolerance to the cleaner

16:29.510 --> 16:31.207
I'll let you keep going.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.690
Mom, I'm worried I might be
getting permanent brain damage.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.258
That's how I felt hearing you
play the piano. We're even.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.958
Where is that
clueless knucklehead?

16:43.045 --> 16:45.526
Well, we got a nice assortment
on the roof.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.920
♪ Aye Calypso ♪

16:49.008 --> 16:51.010

17:18.428 --> 17:20.996
Can't believe you just left
a message on my machine

17:21.083 --> 17:23.042
telling me
you were leaving town.

17:24.869 --> 17:26.088
I was humiliated, grandma.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.090
More humiliated than
when I caught you

17:28.177 --> 17:31.789
cutting a mouth hole
in my wig head?

17:31.876 --> 17:34.401
I was 13 years old, and that
wasn't what it looked like.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.317
It looked like a young boy
having sex with a wig head.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.974
I thought you came here
to cheer me up.

17:44.498 --> 17:48.241
Look, boy, losing somebody
is never easy.

17:48.328 --> 17:51.766
But you gotta get over this
woman and get on with your life.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.811
It's so hard, grandma.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.726
Having somebody you love
not love you back.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.685
I know that.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.991
When your grandpa left me

18:00.079 --> 18:03.995
I thought my whole world
was gonna fall apart.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.260
- Left you?
- No, you told me he died.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.652
What was I gonna tell you?

18:08.739 --> 18:10.219
That I came home one day

18:10.306 --> 18:13.483
he'd packed up all his stuff
and skipped town?

18:13.570 --> 18:15.181
So why did you say he was dead?

18:15.268 --> 18:16.530
He's dead to me.

18:16.617 --> 18:17.792
And if I ever see him again

18:17.879 --> 18:20.751
he'll be dead
to everybody else, too.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.536
Disappearing son of a bitch.

18:24.277 --> 18:26.322
Well, why are you
telling me this now?

18:26.409 --> 18:29.804
Guess I was just
too humiliated before.

18:29.891 --> 18:33.547
But, eventually,
somebody else came into my life

18:33.634 --> 18:36.027
and brought me more joy

18:36.115 --> 18:38.595
than I could ever imagine.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.207
- Who was that?
- I'll give you a hint.

18:42.425 --> 18:46.081
He's young and handsome

18:46.168 --> 18:48.736
and I'm sharing
a porch swing with him.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.220
I love you, grandma.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.525
[laughing]

18:55.612 --> 18:57.136
I love you, too.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.098
And if you ever
decide to leave town again

19:03.185 --> 19:04.621
you better take me with you.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.797
[chuckles]

19:06.884 --> 19:08.190
It's a deal.

19:09.974 --> 19:12.281
Anywhere but Indiana.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.683
Mike, I'm stuffed.
I can't eat any more of this.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.206
Come on, Molly's
gonna be home any minute

19:24.293 --> 19:25.947
and I don't want her to know
I cheated on my diet.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.775
But I've already eaten
half the pan of veggie lasagna

19:27.862 --> 19:29.429
and four yogurt cups.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.996
Smoke some more pot
and tear through this stuff.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.391
Mike, you are a cop.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.263
I don't think you can legally
tell me to do that.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.439
Hey, I have turned a blind eye
for three years

19:39.526 --> 19:41.397
while your bedroom smelled
like Willie Nelson's beard.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.573
Let's go!

19:43.660 --> 19:45.401
That's her. Here, hide this
in the trunk of your car.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.055
Throw the carrots
up on the roof.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.926
There's somethin' up there
that will eat anything.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.235
If I have any more of this
Turkey chili

19:53.322 --> 19:55.194
I'm gonna crap a pilgrim.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.501

There's my gal.
How was the teacher conference?

20:05.987 --> 20:07.336
Oh, I think it was fun.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.643

- More than I can tell you.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.299
Oh.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.179

20:27.095 --> 20:29.402
