00:06.753 --> 00:09.244
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.323 --> 00:11.382
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.458 --> 00:14.291
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.361 --> 00:16.329
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:18.332 --> 00:22.666
And I'm pleased to announce that the
contract for Julius Seven is ours.

00:28.108 --> 00:32.875
Manufacturing this new component will
improve the security of our country.

00:32.946 --> 00:35.813
In charge of this
project will be Don,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.650
With the support
and assistance of Paul.

00:48.562 --> 00:50.427
You must feel
so disappointed.

00:50.497 --> 00:53.933
Anyway, did you notice that the
registration on your car expired last week?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.968
I was lucky I didn't
get a ticket.

00:56.036 --> 00:58.664
<i>If you come home by 5:00,
I'll go to the DMV.</i>

00:59.005 --> 01:01.200
Here, Mom, I did my exercise.

01:02.476 --> 01:05.001
<i>I can't leave early today,
I got to...</i>

01:05.679 --> 01:07.408
Doreen, I got to go.

01:11.852 --> 01:14.184
Mom, I can't
find my blue jacket.

01:14.254 --> 01:16.620
Okay. Honey, you ready to go?

01:18.859 --> 01:23.296
It's not gonna fit, Mom. Too bad
you can't sit up front like me.

01:23.363 --> 01:24.921
This is just
an exception, Adam.

01:24.998 --> 01:28.297
Why do I have to sit in
my car seat? It's no fair.

01:28.368 --> 01:31.303
I wish the world was fair,
Billy. I really do.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.656 --> 01:53.752
You know, you're leaking oil.
You want us to check that for you?

01:53.827 --> 01:55.226
No, thanks.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.565
I see you have
the boys in the car.

02:13.313 --> 02:14.507
Give it
to your brother.

02:24.791 --> 02:27.521
Mom, I should be
sitting in the front seat.

02:27.594 --> 02:30.427
People don't always
get what they deserve.

02:36.570 --> 02:40.506
Mom! Can you tell
him to give me my...

02:41.608 --> 02:44.202
Adam, put your
seatbelt on right.

02:47.848 --> 02:50.146
It's too windy back here.

02:52.018 --> 02:53.485
Mom, you pushed
the wrong button...

02:53.553 --> 02:58.217
Adam! Please.

04:10.931 --> 04:13.559
Got a real mess here.
Three kids dead,

04:13.633 --> 04:17.728
the fourth, a little boy, was taken
to University Hospital with the mom.

04:17.803 --> 04:19.135
Is there a dad?

04:19.204 --> 04:21.696
Paul Whitlock.
Car is registered to him.

04:21.774 --> 04:24.107
He's on his way
to the hospital.

04:26.379 --> 04:28.847
The boy and his mother
were pulled out of the car?

04:28.915 --> 04:31.611
No. They were
found here, unconscious.

04:32.285 --> 04:33.616
They went through
the windshield.

04:33.687 --> 04:35.484
It's a miracle the blast
didn't kill them all.

04:35.555 --> 04:37.648
Anybody see it happen?

04:37.724 --> 04:39.692
No. This is a quiet road.

04:43.930 --> 04:47.798
Glass is inside the panels.
Windows were open.

04:47.867 --> 04:51.701
That would've reduced the
force of the blast in the front.

04:51.771 --> 04:53.170
It's probably why
they survived.

04:53.239 --> 04:55.969
These little ones
never stood a chance.

04:58.044 --> 05:02.504
Three child seats.
That's a tight fit.

05:04.284 --> 05:06.411
This can't be their usual car.

05:06.486 --> 05:08.351
Pipe bomb under
the gas tank.

05:09.389 --> 05:13.621
We'll test a soot sample. My guess
is they packed it with fertilizer.

05:14.761 --> 05:18.492
Well, someone would have had to
go underneath the car to plant it.

05:23.069 --> 05:24.866
Do you know where
their last stop was?

05:24.938 --> 05:27.566
Gas station.
About a half mile away.

05:30.677 --> 05:33.578
Mrs. Whitlock comes in once
a week with her boys.

05:33.647 --> 05:35.945
I talked to her.
She was leaking oil.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.813
I asked her if she wanted us
to take a look at it.

05:37.884 --> 05:39.681
Did she usually
drive that sedan?

05:39.753 --> 05:41.186
No, a minivan.

05:42.622 --> 05:43.611
She pay at the pump?

05:43.690 --> 05:46.215
Inside, and she bought
ice cream for her boys.

05:46.292 --> 05:48.419
She left the car unattended.

05:48.828 --> 05:50.193
Did anybody go near it?

05:50.263 --> 05:52.788
Yeah. After she paid,
this guy came towards it.

05:52.866 --> 05:53.855
Where did he come from?

05:53.933 --> 05:55.525
Right over there,
the air pump.

05:55.602 --> 05:57.661
It was him and two
other guys in a truck.

05:57.737 --> 06:00.297
And they were arguing,
but I couldn't understand.

06:00.373 --> 06:02.841
Arguing? In another language?

06:02.909 --> 06:05.173
Arabic. I mean,
I recognized it

06:05.245 --> 06:08.009
because I hear Mr. Aziz
and his wife talking.

06:08.081 --> 06:10.276
Did Mrs. Whitlock talk
to any of those men?

06:10.350 --> 06:11.783
No. But the guy
with the mustache,

06:11.851 --> 06:14.581
he looked at her,
and he went like this.

06:14.654 --> 06:17.452
And then he started walking towards
her, and Mrs. Whitlock saw him coming.

06:17.524 --> 06:19.515
She got in her car
and she took off.

06:21.428 --> 06:24.864
I took Doreen's van because I
had to leave early for a meeting

06:24.931 --> 06:26.956
and my car was low on gas.

06:29.269 --> 06:31.567
We're very sorry,
Mr. Whitlock.

06:33.373 --> 06:35.705
But otherwise,
I take the sedan.

06:36.309 --> 06:41.770
You work at Windale Electronics in
Brooklyn. What exactly do you do?

06:42.148 --> 06:45.845
I'm an engineer. I design
components for everything from

06:46.853 --> 06:49.219
air purifiers to MRI machines.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.958
Anything controversial?

06:53.026 --> 06:54.425
What's my work got
to do with this?

06:55.161 --> 06:57.789
These men were
at the gas station.

06:57.864 --> 06:59.798
They are possibly
Middle Eastern.

06:59.866 --> 07:02.562
They may have been
following your wife.

07:02.902 --> 07:05.666
Now, we need to know if there's
anything you're working on

07:05.739 --> 07:09.607
that might make you
a target for terrorists.

07:12.612 --> 07:15.706
I invented a new kind of
igniter for land mines.

07:16.082 --> 07:18.915
It degrades over time. The
mines become safe after a year.

07:18.985 --> 07:21.681
Are they being used
in the Middle East?

07:22.956 --> 07:26.016
The army field-tested them for
six months. I don't know where.

07:26.092 --> 07:29.528
Does anybody outside the
company know about your project?

07:29.596 --> 07:33.054
It's not my project.
I'm not in charge of it.

07:37.670 --> 07:41.470
Well, the gas station
attendant said that your wife

07:41.541 --> 07:44.135
seemed concerned
about these men.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.871
Now, did she ever
mention to you

07:46.613 --> 07:50.105
about seeing anybody watching
the house or following her?

07:50.183 --> 07:55.246
No. She always kept
her eyes on the boys.

07:58.057 --> 08:04.087
That's just what I'd tell her.
Just take care of my boys.

08:11.204 --> 08:13.399
Company said that the mines
were deployed in Kuwait.

08:13.473 --> 08:16.465
<i>The only mention of the project
is in the Kings County Express.</i>

08:16.543 --> 08:19.410
And once it got on the Internet,
the whole world could read about it.

08:19.479 --> 08:21.310
We got a hit off the prints
on the air-hose.

08:21.381 --> 08:23.849
Tariq Shalaan,
Egyptian national.

08:23.917 --> 08:26.977
He came in on a student visa
in January of '02.

08:28.988 --> 08:31.752
His visa expired eight months
ago. Good luck finding him.

08:34.394 --> 08:38.261
This antenna is used for
tracking illegal cable TV boxes.

08:38.331 --> 08:42.357
One of Shalaan's sponsors,
his cousin, he lists

08:42.735 --> 08:44.498
his employer as
Concordia Cable.

08:44.571 --> 08:47.836
Maybe he knows enough
electronics to rig up a bomb.

08:48.908 --> 08:52.139
Which one made
the throat-cutting move?

08:52.212 --> 08:53.236
The mustache.

09:04.991 --> 09:07.619
Step into him. Hard.

09:10.430 --> 09:11.920
Please, tell me what you want!

09:11.998 --> 09:13.863
We are not terrorists.
We have green cards.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.901
This was on a workbench
in a back room.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.563
It is a clock radio.
I am fixing it.

09:18.638 --> 09:22.096
You were seen at a gas station
in Staten Island this morning.

09:22.175 --> 09:24.143
Yes, we were lost.
Papa!

09:25.778 --> 09:26.972
Please, do not touch her!

09:27.046 --> 09:30.106
Let's have a female officer
watch these ladies.

09:31.251 --> 09:33.116
Please tell your wife
to sit down.

09:37.156 --> 09:38.953
Stay with Mama, okay?

09:41.728 --> 09:44.253
There was a woman with
four children in a car.

09:44.330 --> 09:46.025
You were seen approaching it.

09:46.099 --> 09:47.566
Yes, to ask for directions.

09:47.634 --> 09:49.966
Somebody saw you do this.
We know what that means.

09:50.036 --> 09:52.596
I was arguing with my cousin.
We were lost.

09:52.672 --> 09:54.902
I did this because I didn't
want to argue anymore.

09:54.974 --> 09:57.909
Maybe the bomb was intended
for her husband.

09:57.977 --> 10:01.242
No. I tell you, I wanted
to ask for directions.

10:01.314 --> 10:05.011
But I hear her say, "People
don't get what they deserve,"

10:05.084 --> 10:07.746
and I think she was disciplining
her boy, so I leave her alone.

10:07.820 --> 10:11.017
That's a nice story, Mr.
Al-Bana, except your employer says

10:11.090 --> 10:14.218
you had no business on
Staten Island this morning.

10:14.294 --> 10:16.319
My friend and my cousin,

10:16.396 --> 10:19.024
we make music at my niece's
school this morning.

10:19.098 --> 10:20.326
We are musicians.

10:22.468 --> 10:24.368
She has a paper
from the school.

10:43.690 --> 10:45.885
This is my client's application
for a visa extension,

10:45.959 --> 10:48.291
filed three months
before it expired.

10:48.361 --> 10:49.555
And denied.
He shouldn't be here.

10:49.629 --> 10:50.653
It wasn't denied.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.823
His application is
still being processed.

10:52.899 --> 10:56.096
Principal at the school
confirmed they were there.

10:57.403 --> 10:59.735
We had to take
this all the way.

11:02.542 --> 11:06.706
What Doreen Whitlock told her son,
"People get what they deserve. "

11:06.779 --> 11:09.304
Now, Paul made a point
of telling us

11:10.016 --> 11:13.452
that he wasn't put in charge
of the land mine project.

11:14.220 --> 11:17.485
Office politics. It makes
some people go postal.

11:22.795 --> 11:25.889
I put Don Mariner in charge. I made
the announcement yesterday morning.

11:25.965 --> 11:29.628
Was there any competition between
Mr. Mariner and Paul Whitlock?

11:29.702 --> 11:32.535
Oh, sure. But there was never
any doubt who'd get it.

11:32.605 --> 11:34.630
Except maybe in Paul's mind.

11:34.707 --> 11:35.731
Why?

11:36.142 --> 11:39.839
Paul's family obligations kept him
from being as effective as he could be.

11:39.912 --> 11:43.473
"Kept"? This wasn't the first
time he'd been passed over?

11:44.517 --> 11:47.042
He pretty much hit
the ceiling here.

11:47.120 --> 11:50.317
It's too bad. He seemed
like a very ambitious guy.

11:51.190 --> 11:52.851
Maybe he still is.

11:52.925 --> 11:54.654
Maybe he figured
once the family goes,

11:54.727 --> 11:57.457
the obligations
would go with them.

12:06.239 --> 12:07.399
Paul?

12:07.473 --> 12:08.599
You're in the hospital.

12:10.476 --> 12:14.913
There was an explosion.
Only you and Adam survived.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.620
Is he hurt? Is he...

12:22.688 --> 12:27.751
I'm making sure he's well cared for.
There's no need for you to see him.

12:43.242 --> 12:45.972
The older boys were
being home-schooled.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.244
Rosary beads. The kids could be
home-schooled for religious reasons.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.748
I don't see any other
signs of devotion.

13:01.194 --> 13:05.790
Must be the older boy's. Handwriting's
poor, the spacing's uneven.

13:05.865 --> 13:08.095
Oh, give the poor kid a break.

13:11.771 --> 13:14.604
That chair, was that like
that when you got here?

13:14.674 --> 13:15.902
Yeah.

13:15.975 --> 13:17.943
Somebody here has
a brown thumb.

13:18.010 --> 13:20.672
The leaves are thriving,
but the flowers aren't.

13:20.746 --> 13:22.805
Getting too much nitrogen.

13:26.352 --> 13:30.721
Get this to the lab. We need to know
what kind of fertilizer's in here.

13:33.693 --> 13:37.151
They found perlite and potting
soil, but no fertilizer.

13:42.335 --> 13:43.666
You guys broom up in here?

13:43.736 --> 13:44.760
No.

13:44.837 --> 13:48.568
There are streaks from bristles
in the top layer of the oil.

13:49.342 --> 13:51.640
Someone swept
the whole garage.

13:53.980 --> 13:56.505
What time did you guys
punch in here yesterday?

13:56.582 --> 13:57.571
Around 1:00.

13:57.650 --> 13:59.117
The bomb went off
at 11:00.

13:59.185 --> 14:01.676
Whitlock was called by 11:30.

14:01.754 --> 14:03.051
No one was here until 1:00.

14:05.057 --> 14:09.460
Whitlock could've came here and
cleaned up all the evidence of the bomb.

14:10.296 --> 14:13.322
So much for rushing
to his wife's bedside.

14:14.700 --> 14:19.399
The bomb used an electronic timer
found in common household appliances.

14:19.472 --> 14:22.498
The pipe was packed with a kilo
of nitrogen-rich fertilizer.

14:22.575 --> 14:24.372
Any match to what's
in the flowerpot?

14:24.443 --> 14:29.107
The sample was too degraded. The family
cat started using it as a litter box.

14:30.249 --> 14:35.516
Family annihilator. Whitlock,
he fits part of that profile.

14:35.922 --> 14:38.482
He's white. He's in his 30s.

14:38.558 --> 14:42.324
He's invested in his family.
Sole breadwinner.

14:42.395 --> 14:46.456
If he felt they were holding him
back, he'd take it out on them.

14:46.532 --> 14:49.228
Unless he sees his demotion
as a failure to them.

14:49.302 --> 14:52.533
Whitlock had to set the timer
before he left for work.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.869
And he had to know his family'd
be on the road at 11:00.

14:54.941 --> 14:56.636
Well, this may be how he knew.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.473
I'm looking at two incoming
calls from Whitlock's office,

14:59.545 --> 15:04.539
one to the home at 10:20 and
one to Doreen's cell at 10:57,

15:04.617 --> 15:06.847
just before the bomb went off.

15:06.919 --> 15:09.387
The first call could've been
him sending her on an errand.

15:09.455 --> 15:12.891
And the second was to make
sure they were on the road.

15:15.795 --> 15:17.422
Paul called you
that morning.

15:17.496 --> 15:19.964
Do you remember
what you talked about?

15:20.032 --> 15:22.967
He reminded me to renew
my car registration.

15:23.035 --> 15:25.060
He's so good
about those things.

15:25.137 --> 15:28.573
He gave you his car with an
empty gas tank. Is that...

15:29.408 --> 15:31.501
He do that often?

15:31.577 --> 15:33.169
It was an important meeting.

15:33.946 --> 15:37.905
So when he called you, did he ask you
to go to the gas station right away?

15:37.984 --> 15:40.976
No, I always do the errands
before quiet time.

15:42.455 --> 15:47.654
I sit on Adam's bed in the
boys' room and read stories

15:49.662 --> 15:52.563
to Adam and Billy
while Pete and Theo sleep.

15:53.232 --> 15:55.826
So, your schedule.
You take the kids,

15:56.502 --> 16:00.529
you give the kids their lessons
and you take them out on errands.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.338
And then it's quiet time.

16:04.610 --> 16:07.078
Paul know this is
your schedule every morning?

16:07.146 --> 16:09.580
Yes, he's the one
who designed it.

16:12.018 --> 16:15.010
Ever get a babysitter
sometimes, when you run errands?

16:15.087 --> 16:18.022
Oh, no. Paul thinks
it's a waste of money.

16:18.090 --> 16:20.285
Doreen, everything all right?

16:21.327 --> 16:22.919
I specified no visitors.

16:22.995 --> 16:27.056
We're just trying to find out who
hurt your family, Mr. Whitlock.

16:27.967 --> 16:29.059
That's your job.

16:29.135 --> 16:31.069
Mine's to make sure
my wife and son get better.

16:31.137 --> 16:34.436
Hey, you know, you're right.
We'll leave you alone.

16:35.207 --> 16:40.645
I just... Prayer card,
who gave you that?

16:40.713 --> 16:41.737
My mother.

16:47.620 --> 16:51.989
Paul and Doreen had a rosary like
that in their home. Is that yours?

16:52.058 --> 16:56.222
Yes. I stayed a couple
of weeks with them.

16:56.929 --> 16:58.794
To give Doreen a hand?

16:58.864 --> 17:02.925
So I thought, but she and Paul do
such a wonderful job themselves.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.163
Is that why you left there?

17:06.571 --> 17:09.837
Doreen and Paul wanted to turn the
guest room into a room for Adam,

17:09.909 --> 17:12.036
so I went back to Rochester.

17:12.778 --> 17:16.111
Sounded to us like Adam was still
sharing a room with his brothers.

17:16.182 --> 17:19.208
Maybe Paul and Doreen didn't
want you to see them fighting.

17:19.285 --> 17:24.551
No, they...
Paul never loses his temper.

17:25.491 --> 17:29.222
He provides structure
and stability for Doreen.

17:29.295 --> 17:30.489
You mean he's controlling?

17:30.563 --> 17:33.259
No. Doreen needs guidance.

17:34.533 --> 17:39.334
She was a lost kid.
Motherhood's changed her.

17:41.273 --> 17:44.265
What kind of structure does
Paul provide for his sons?

17:44.343 --> 17:46.937
He spends all his time
with them.

17:47.012 --> 17:50.743
In the morning, he has a special
routine for Adam and Billy.

17:52.017 --> 17:53.006
Routine?

17:53.085 --> 17:54.677
He does exercises with them.

17:55.855 --> 17:58.289
Stretching, lifting weights.

17:58.357 --> 18:01.451
I saw the weights in the garage.
Is that where they exercise?

18:01.527 --> 18:04.257
Yes. Before Paul goes to work.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.766
I wonder if Adam saw his dad
stretching under the car.

18:11.470 --> 18:14.166
The nurse didn't take
your temperature.

18:14.807 --> 18:16.900
She took it. It was normal.

18:17.376 --> 18:19.810
She just forgot
to write it down.

18:22.548 --> 18:24.209
You have a fever.

18:24.984 --> 18:26.315
The nurse said it was normal.

18:26.385 --> 18:28.785
Feel your head. It's burning.

18:29.789 --> 18:31.984
Feel it. I'm right, aren't I?

18:32.958 --> 18:33.947
Paul...

18:34.026 --> 18:35.926
Admit it, I'm right.
You have a fever.

18:35.995 --> 18:39.021
Yes, you're right.

18:39.098 --> 18:40.793
What I have to put up
with around here!

18:43.536 --> 18:45.970
We did jumping jacks
and push-ups.

18:47.006 --> 18:50.203
Did your dad check his car?
Maybe look underneath?

18:50.810 --> 18:55.042
No. He said he was out of gas, so
he'd have to take Mom's car anyway.

18:56.148 --> 19:00.551
What about when he called before you left.
Did you hear what they were talking about?

19:00.619 --> 19:06.148
No. But then Mom zoomed out the window,
and then she said she'd buy us ice cream.

19:07.293 --> 19:08.351
Zooming?

19:08.427 --> 19:11.658
That's what me and my brothers call
it when Mom stares at something.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.823
You mean when she was
staring out the window

19:13.899 --> 19:17.164
at the chair that was turned
over in the backyard?

19:17.236 --> 19:19.500
I don't know. She just zooms.

19:19.572 --> 19:20.596
She just zooms.

19:25.478 --> 19:27.742
Was your mom
sad that morning?

19:37.656 --> 19:44.585
Adam, when you were driving
from the gas station,

19:46.365 --> 19:48.196
did your mom say
anything to you?

19:48.267 --> 19:52.431
She got mad at me for playing with
the windows, but then she said...

19:58.811 --> 20:00.369
What'd she say, Adam?

20:00.446 --> 20:06.078
She said that even though most people
think horseshoe crabs are crabs,

20:06.151 --> 20:09.314
they're actually arthropods and that
they're even older than dinosaurs.

20:09.388 --> 20:13.290
Wow. She say anything else?

20:19.031 --> 20:22.398
That's a really cool dinosaur.
Did you do this today?

20:23.269 --> 20:26.432
Nice. Hey, do you think
we could keep this?

20:26.939 --> 20:28.270
Will you hang it up?

20:28.340 --> 20:32.674
Yeah, we will hang it up.
Hey, thanks.

20:46.792 --> 20:50.125
So, it's not the husband.
It's Doreen.

20:51.630 --> 20:54.155
And her son's trying
to protect her.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.531
He knows that he shouldn't
tell us what she said.

21:00.272 --> 21:05.505
I can't imagine her last words to
her kids before she blew them up.

21:10.049 --> 21:14.042
Didn't someone tell me the husband
swept up evidence of the bomb?

21:14.620 --> 21:18.056
The case against him makes
more sense. He has the know-how.

21:18.123 --> 21:19.784
Anybody can build
a pipe bomb.

21:19.858 --> 21:22.952
She was distracted, she
was staring out of windows.

21:23.028 --> 21:26.327
You know, she was buying her
kids ice cream out of the blue.

21:26.398 --> 21:29.561
You know, taken together,
those could be warning signs.

21:29.635 --> 21:32.195
You're talking about
a mother planning a murder

21:32.271 --> 21:34.535
so heinous as to
be incomprehensible.

21:34.607 --> 21:37.098
A murder-suicide.

21:37.443 --> 21:39.673
If her son hadn't opened
the car window,

21:39.745 --> 21:41.337
she would've died
along with her children.

21:41.413 --> 21:44.473
Mothers don't just go
into a homicidal spiral.

21:44.883 --> 21:49.343
A grand jury will want to know why.
I'd like to give them an answer.

21:53.626 --> 21:56.094
"Why" is good.
"How" is better.

21:57.496 --> 21:59.589
Put some meat on the plate.

22:01.400 --> 22:04.426
Did you see what the kid
wrote on the dinosaur drawing?

22:04.503 --> 22:07.939
"Andy looked for his friends,
but they weren't there. "

22:09.041 --> 22:11.339
The loneliest kid
in the world.

22:13.512 --> 22:15.946
Look at the boy's
writing on this.

22:16.448 --> 22:18.712
He shows signs of dysgraphia.

22:18.784 --> 22:20.684
You know,
a learning disability, right?

22:22.187 --> 22:27.022
But on this, he wrote within the
lines, his spacing is more even.

22:27.693 --> 22:30.856
He might've been diagnosed
and gotten help.

22:32.564 --> 22:37.524
A parent might take their kid's learning
disability as a personal failure.

22:38.037 --> 22:40.631
Especially if
they're home-schooled.

22:41.473 --> 22:42.940
So Adam's got
sloppy handwriting.

22:43.008 --> 22:45.033
That's not
a learning disability.

22:45.110 --> 22:49.046
Well, we talked to the teacher
who... Sorry. Who tested him,

22:49.682 --> 22:52.776
and she said that she
recommended a special school.

22:52.851 --> 22:55.342
I did my research.
Adam doesn't belong there.

22:55.421 --> 22:56.854
This is something we
can correct at home.

22:56.922 --> 23:00.323
Have you noticed,
Mr. Whitlock,

23:00.392 --> 23:03.919
your wife's moods?
Your son did.

23:06.865 --> 23:09.425
You really think that
I would leave my kids alone

23:09.501 --> 23:11.025
with a woman I thought
could harm them?

23:11.103 --> 23:13.003
Hey, look... There's
nothing wrong with my wife.

23:13.072 --> 23:16.269
There was nothing wrong
with my family. Excuse me.

23:16.875 --> 23:20.675
One more thing.
The morning of the explosion,

23:20.746 --> 23:25.740
you have trouble getting from your office
to the hospital? You know, maybe traffic?

23:26.719 --> 23:27.947
No, why?

23:32.191 --> 23:34.386
You were notified at 11:30,

23:35.260 --> 23:39.663
and it looks like the timestamp on
the hospital forms you signed says

23:39.732 --> 23:43.259
12:50. I mean,
why were you late?

23:43.969 --> 23:46.938
It's a straight shot across
the Verrazano from the office.

23:47.005 --> 23:51.738
Verrazano, there was a hang-up,
a car with a flat tire. That's it.

23:55.514 --> 23:59.075
Timestamp? Nice bluff.
Better than his alibi.

23:59.151 --> 24:03.315
No, he first went home. Cleaned
the garage. Because he knew

24:04.623 --> 24:08.184
that it was probably Doreen who was
responsible the minute he got the call.

24:08.260 --> 24:11.855
He decides to cover for her. Me,
I'd want to tear her eyes out.

24:11.930 --> 24:13.522
Yeah, or his own.
I mean, he'd be furious,

24:13.599 --> 24:16.693
he'd be terrified,
he'd be grieving.

24:17.669 --> 24:21.571
Instead,
he has no affect at all.

24:23.942 --> 24:27.810
Their youngest, he was,
what, 18 months? Excuse me.

24:29.081 --> 24:33.108
This breast pump, it's for Mrs.
Whitlock? She's still lactating?

24:33.218 --> 24:36.085
Yes. Poor thing was still
nursing her three-year-old.

24:36.155 --> 24:38.123
You mean 18-month-old?

24:38.190 --> 24:41.318
No, she wasn't nursing the little
one. She said after her C-section,

24:41.393 --> 24:44.385
her hands shook so bad
she couldn't hold him.

24:45.964 --> 24:48.797
Shaky hands. A C-section
wouldn't do that.

24:49.568 --> 24:52.332
But postpartum
depression would.

24:56.775 --> 25:00.575
I wanted her to continue therapy,
but she said money was a problem.

25:00.646 --> 25:01.908
She couldn't afford you?

25:01.980 --> 25:03.004
Her husband.

25:03.081 --> 25:07.609
She said he gave her an allowance
and kept records of her expenses.

25:07.686 --> 25:09.517
He wouldn't approve
of her therapy.

25:09.588 --> 25:11.317
He didn't want outsiders
butting in.

25:11.390 --> 25:14.826
What about medications,
anti-depressants? Did you prescribe any?

25:14.893 --> 25:17.828
Yes, of course. And I would
hope she'd still be taking them.

25:17.896 --> 25:19.887
Well, there's one way
to find out.

25:19.965 --> 25:21.398
You didn't follow up
with her?

25:21.466 --> 25:24.993
This was June last year. I called
her after she missed her appointment.

25:25.070 --> 25:28.665
She said her husband found a house
and they had to move right away.

25:28.740 --> 25:32.369
Extension 3272, please.
Yes, in ICU.

25:33.512 --> 25:37.471
Packing and moving with a newborn,
after a C-section, with three other kids?

25:37.549 --> 25:40.882
Sounds like torture.
Yes, this is Detective Eames.

25:40.953 --> 25:44.150
I've a question about
Mrs. Whitlock's medication.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.984
Did he say why?
Hold on, please.

25:48.060 --> 25:52.053
Whitlock checked Doreen out this
morning, against medical advice.

25:52.931 --> 25:54.558
I want you people
off my property.

25:54.633 --> 25:57.932
Your wife had postpartum
depression. She never got treatment,

25:58.003 --> 26:00.938
she never took her
medication, she's suicidal.

26:01.006 --> 26:03.668
Everything, everything
I do is for my family.

26:03.742 --> 26:05.073
I can take care
of Doreen here.

26:05.143 --> 26:08.544
You have any other theories,
talk to my lawyer.

26:08.647 --> 26:12.845
I don't know about you, but that
guy's starting to stick in my craw.

26:15.053 --> 26:17.783
This place,
this dead-end street.

26:18.957 --> 26:21.187
Houses that sit
empty all day.

26:22.861 --> 26:25.125
You can hear a blade
of grass fall over.

26:25.197 --> 26:27.427
She was kept
cooped up in there.

26:27.866 --> 26:30.926
Four little boys.
No breaks,

26:32.070 --> 26:35.471
no one to help.
All according to his design.

26:35.841 --> 26:39.402
Maybe he plans on punishing
her according to his design.

26:41.246 --> 26:45.046
We need to get a squad car. Let
him know that we're watching.

26:50.923 --> 26:53.323
You can't make it upstairs,
so you'll sleep here.

26:53.392 --> 26:55.417
No, Paul, please!
Oh, yes.

26:55.894 --> 26:56.986
I can't. No!

26:57.062 --> 27:00.498
Yes. You can. You will.

27:14.513 --> 27:17.607
There's no arrest warrant,
no evidence against her. So,

27:17.683 --> 27:19.742
why the squad car
outside her house?

27:19.818 --> 27:23.015
The detectives believe
Mrs. Whitlock is in danger.

27:23.088 --> 27:25.147
From whom?
From her husband.

27:25.223 --> 27:27.350
He's been nothing
but supportive.

27:27.426 --> 27:29.360
I want the dogs
called off, Mr. Carver.

27:29.428 --> 27:33.626
I decide when they go back to
the kennel, Mr. Milner. Thank you.

27:38.337 --> 27:40.635
What's your problem
with Mr. Whitlock?

27:41.373 --> 27:43.398
You have nothing to
justify this surveillance.

27:43.475 --> 27:48.037
No prior domestic dispute calls,
no medical evidence of abuse.

27:48.113 --> 27:50.547
Doreen killed those kids.
He knows it.

27:50.615 --> 27:52.310
You want Mrs. Whitlock
out of that house?

27:52.384 --> 27:55.046
Bring me enough evidence
for an arrest warrant.

27:55.120 --> 27:58.055
What about the fertilizer?
The plastic pipe? The timer?

27:58.123 --> 27:59.818
She might've paid
cash for those.

27:59.891 --> 28:03.224
Except Whitlock kept a
tight leash on her spending.

28:04.096 --> 28:06.894
Maybe she got her
house guest to chip in.

28:11.303 --> 28:15.831
I may have last month's card
statement, if I didn't pay it.

28:15.907 --> 28:17.670
Oh, here.
You mind?

28:19.144 --> 28:24.548
When you lived with them, did Doreen
ever borrow your card or ask for money?

28:24.616 --> 28:28.484
No. Paul and Doreen didn't
want to spoil the boys.

28:28.553 --> 28:31.147
They were such
high-quality children.

28:33.692 --> 28:37.651
"High-quality children. "
Paul say that?

28:37.729 --> 28:38.753
Yes.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.038
This was her room.
Yes.

28:50.776 --> 28:54.507
I bet she's had this picture
since she was a little girl.

28:57.315 --> 28:59.806
First thing she saw
in the morning.

29:01.686 --> 29:03.847
Last thing she saw at night.

29:11.096 --> 29:13.428
She wanted to be
a good mother.

29:16.535 --> 29:20.062
Ms. Colson, there's a credit
here from Greenblatt Appliances

29:20.138 --> 29:22.936
near where Doreen lives
for $49.95.

29:23.542 --> 29:26.443
Did you charge something
and then return it?

29:28.713 --> 29:32.240
No, I'm sure I didn't.

29:33.752 --> 29:36.243
Let me get my glasses.

29:39.124 --> 29:42.685
Maybe Doreen borrowed her
mother's credit card after all.

29:43.929 --> 29:48.059
To buy an appliance.
Maybe one with a timer.

29:51.103 --> 29:55.267
It was for a propane space heater.
One of the clerks took the return.

29:55.340 --> 29:56.329
The unit didn't work.

29:56.408 --> 29:57.807
Does this come
with a timer?

29:57.876 --> 29:59.275
Yeah. You want to see it?

29:59.344 --> 30:00.368
You still have it?

30:00.445 --> 30:03.278
The manufacturer wouldn't take it
back since the consumer opened it up.

30:03.348 --> 30:07.842
They used the wrong screwdriver, I
could tell. The screws were all frayed.

30:10.856 --> 30:13.552
It was the heat exchanger
that was broken.

30:13.625 --> 30:16.116
If it was used
in this condition,

30:16.194 --> 30:18.458
it would leak carbon monoxide,
isn't that right?

30:18.530 --> 30:19.895
Hey, you got a call.

30:19.965 --> 30:21.956
That's right.
I got to take this.

30:22.033 --> 30:25.264
If Doreen used this in the boys'
room during their quiet time,

30:25.337 --> 30:28.636
it would've leaked enough carbon monoxide
to kill them in less than an hour.

30:28.707 --> 30:31.005
But she returned it.
She changed her mind.

30:31.076 --> 30:35.945
Maybe she was afraid that it would be
discovered later that she tampered with it.

30:37.215 --> 30:42.847
Maybe it was important to her not to
have it look like a murder-suicide.

30:42.921 --> 30:45.048
Right now it looks like
a suicide attempt.

30:45.123 --> 30:47.387
Grounds for
involuntary commitment.

30:47.492 --> 30:49.926
That'll get her
out of that house.

30:53.098 --> 30:56.898
My client isn't suicidal.
She's no danger to anybody.

30:56.968 --> 30:59.732
Found the
space heater, Doreen.

30:59.804 --> 31:00.862
The one that you
tampered with.

31:02.207 --> 31:04.835
You left marks on the screws
when you took it apart.

31:04.910 --> 31:06.878
What space heater? What
are they talking about?

31:06.945 --> 31:10.142
When did you start having
those terrible thoughts?

31:11.049 --> 31:13.950
Was it when you couldn't
nurse little Theo?

31:14.352 --> 31:17.788
You must regret not being
able to offer him that gift.

31:18.456 --> 31:20.447
Yes.
But you could have.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.025
If you'd gone to therapy
and taken your medication.

31:25.830 --> 31:29.288
I didn't want to depend on pills.
Pills don't make you a good mother.

31:29.367 --> 31:31.096
Paul tell you that?

31:32.604 --> 31:35.801
You know, keep trying,
apply yourself, because...

31:36.741 --> 31:39.073
That's what
a good mother does.

31:42.714 --> 31:46.775
Yes, but I couldn't do it. There
was something wrong with me.

31:48.920 --> 31:53.584
When Adam was diagnosed with a learning
disability, was that your fault, too?

31:53.658 --> 31:56.183
Something wrong
with your teaching?

31:58.330 --> 32:02.130
I wanted to help him.
But I...

32:02.901 --> 32:06.667
Four boys in seven years.
Always one in diapers.

32:06.738 --> 32:09.434
Should be no problem
for a good mother.

32:11.209 --> 32:14.736
You always wanted to be a
good mother, isn't that right?

32:16.648 --> 32:19.879
You used to pray
to Mother Mary

32:21.186 --> 32:25.748
to bless you with children, so that
you'd be a good mother when you grew up.

32:27.926 --> 32:32.625
But it was always just out of your
reach, no matter how hard you tried.

32:34.933 --> 32:37.834
And that's when you started
to have those thoughts.

32:37.902 --> 32:41.360
That maybe they'd be better off without
you, these high-quality children.

32:41.439 --> 32:44.067
But you couldn't
leave them behind.

32:44.142 --> 32:45.632
You couldn't do that to Paul.

32:49.247 --> 32:52.182
Is that when you
thought of the space heater?

32:52.651 --> 32:55.745
You know, put it in the boys'
room during their quiet time?

32:55.820 --> 32:58.482
That it would be
a peaceful way to go.

32:59.524 --> 33:01.458
You got
everything together,

33:01.526 --> 33:05.553
but then you realized people would
know you killed your children.

33:06.531 --> 33:10.934
It'd make Paul look bad.
So that time, you stopped.

33:15.740 --> 33:18.937
I thought...
I thought that would...

33:19.010 --> 33:23.003
You thought that those thoughts
would... That they would go away?

33:25.650 --> 33:27.777
That's part of your disease.

33:32.324 --> 33:34.224
Every imperfect thing,

33:36.661 --> 33:40.529
even the chair that was
overturned in your backyard,

33:42.867 --> 33:45.995
is a reminder to you that
you're not a good mother,

33:46.071 --> 33:47.971
that you were
a disappointment.

33:50.108 --> 33:55.842
I tried.
I tried, I tried,

33:56.247 --> 34:02.152
but I couldn't. I just
wanted them to go to heaven.

34:02.987 --> 34:06.479
I'd be a better mother
in heaven, I would.

34:07.926 --> 34:09.893
I told Adam he'd see.

34:11.763 --> 34:15.995
I told him it'll be worth it
when we get there.

34:34.319 --> 34:36.650
My client will submit
to a psychiatric exam,

34:36.721 --> 34:38.416
then we can discuss
a plea agreement.

34:38.489 --> 34:40.389
I won't play games,
Mr. Milner.

34:40.458 --> 34:42.449
If my detectives hadn't
found that space heater...

34:42.527 --> 34:44.654
Oh, please. She made
no effort to hide it.

34:44.728 --> 34:46.697
She left it in plain sight
in the garage.

34:46.764 --> 34:48.357
The garage? No.

34:48.433 --> 34:51.129
See, she returned it to the
store. That's where we found it.

34:51.202 --> 34:54.534
Sorry, no. She told me
she left it in the garage.

34:54.606 --> 34:56.801
I'll be in touch, Mr. Carver.

34:57.308 --> 35:00.800
Whitlock. He returned it.
He found it in the garage.

35:00.879 --> 35:04.042
He's an engineer, he would've
figured out what she'd done.

35:04.115 --> 35:06.276
He returned it and didn't
say a word to his wife.

35:06.351 --> 35:10.651
No, that's the point. He had to know
that she was planning on hurting someone,

35:10.722 --> 35:13.418
or at least herself.
He did nothing.

35:13.491 --> 35:16.426
You can't be sure
what he did or didn't know.

35:18.396 --> 35:21.365
We can't? We'll ask him.

35:24.936 --> 35:27.427
This is a two-way mirror,
isn't it?

35:28.406 --> 35:30.567
This is where you
interrogate people.

35:31.176 --> 35:32.165
Does it make
you uncomfortable?

35:32.243 --> 35:34.438
You know,
a smart guy like you?

35:34.512 --> 35:38.312
We need some information on
Doreen. Social security number,

35:38.383 --> 35:40.977
previous residences,
employment...

35:43.254 --> 35:45.518
This says "Pre-Arraignment
Report. " What's going on?

35:45.590 --> 35:48.150
Your wife's being charged
with three counts of murder

35:48.226 --> 35:50.217
and one count of
attempted murder.

35:50.295 --> 35:53.059
She gave us this statement
this morning.

35:54.599 --> 35:57.033
Okay.
So what happens next to her?

35:59.604 --> 36:00.832
Oh, well, maybe you
don't understand.

36:00.905 --> 36:04.363
Your wife just confessed
to killing your three boys.

36:04.976 --> 36:06.341
I can read.

36:07.812 --> 36:10.076
See? There it is.

36:11.716 --> 36:14.116
Did you ever hear of the word
"affect?" You know what it means?

36:14.185 --> 36:15.618
I guess you're gonna tell me.

36:15.687 --> 36:19.088
It's a psychological term
for a feeling or emotion.

36:19.157 --> 36:22.183
And we've been noticing that
you don't have any affect.

36:22.260 --> 36:25.252
You're not angry at Doreen, you're
not grieving over your family.

36:25.330 --> 36:26.820
I handle things my way.

36:26.898 --> 36:29.992
And you don't feel responsible?
You know, just a little bit?

36:30.068 --> 36:33.367
For this? Doreen's taken
full responsibility.

36:33.438 --> 36:34.837
She would, she would.

36:36.674 --> 36:38.073
But when she was diagnosed
with depression,

36:38.142 --> 36:41.543
wasn't it you who didn't want her
getting any therapy or taking any pills?

36:41.613 --> 36:45.344
She wasn't depressed. She just
needed to focus on the kids.

36:46.117 --> 36:49.052
I told her that if she home-schooled
them, it would improve her state of mind.

36:49.120 --> 36:53.056
Spending more time with the
kids? That's your idea of therapy?

36:53.124 --> 36:54.887
So, sending
Doreen's mother away

36:54.959 --> 36:57.951
when she needed help with
the kids, that was your idea?

36:58.029 --> 37:00.691
All that religious crap. Doreen
and I don't believe in it.

37:00.765 --> 37:03.996
You don't believe in it.
I mean, Doreen, she believes.

37:04.068 --> 37:08.164
But, you know, what you
believe, that's what matters.

37:09.574 --> 37:12.566
What you decide. And you
decided that it would be better

37:12.644 --> 37:15.943
for Doreen to stay in that little house,
home-schooling four kids by herself...

37:16.014 --> 37:18.039
Doreen wanted a family
as much as I did.

37:18.116 --> 37:19.777
Even when she had
postpartum depression,

37:19.851 --> 37:22.547
you kept pushing her
to have more kids.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.349
You know, I'm thinking,
a smart guy like you,

37:24.422 --> 37:25.787
you know,
you'd see it coming.

37:25.857 --> 37:30.419
You'd know she was about to,
you know, crash and burn.

37:30.495 --> 37:32.554
How could I have
foreseen this?

37:32.630 --> 37:36.191
You think I'm some kind of
mind-reader? I'm an engineer.

37:39.904 --> 37:41.371
When you found it
in the garage,

37:41.439 --> 37:43.168
you opened it up
to see what was wrong.

37:43.241 --> 37:44.230
I didn't...

37:44.309 --> 37:45.333
We found your
fingerprints inside,

37:45.410 --> 37:47.173
along with Doreen's.

37:47.745 --> 37:51.613
You know, being an engineer, you would've
figured out that she tampered with it

37:52.884 --> 37:54.715
to leak carbon monoxide.

37:54.786 --> 37:57.186
You know, that it was
a killing machine.

37:57.255 --> 37:59.746
Not to kill you,
which she wouldn't dare.

38:01.259 --> 38:03.022
But to kill herself, maybe?

38:03.094 --> 38:06.257
I didn't know what she was
gonna do before she did it.

38:06.331 --> 38:07.662
So that's why
you returned it,

38:07.732 --> 38:10.326
and you didn't say
anything to her?

38:11.669 --> 38:12.658
But you knew
she might hurt herself.

38:12.737 --> 38:16.264
You ever think she might
hurt the children?

38:16.341 --> 38:17.865
Never my children.

38:17.942 --> 38:20.137
But you knew she was
gonna kill herself.

38:24.449 --> 38:27.282
Yes. And so what?

38:32.123 --> 38:33.681
"So what?"

38:33.758 --> 38:35.123
So what if I knew?

38:35.193 --> 38:38.492
I didn't kill our kids.
I didn't build a bomb.

38:40.732 --> 38:43.166
I see why you're
not angry at her.

38:44.469 --> 38:47.233
Because she's a reflection of
everything that you've done to her.

38:47.305 --> 38:48.363
I did nothing but help her.

38:48.439 --> 38:50.270
No, you terrorized her!

38:51.609 --> 38:53.839
You got kicked around at work,

38:53.911 --> 38:55.276
you came home,
and you crushed her.

38:55.346 --> 38:56.438
I never laid a hand on her.

38:56.514 --> 38:58.277
You didn't have to!

39:00.585 --> 39:03.281
All she wanted to be
was a good mother.

39:04.555 --> 39:08.992
But you designed a trap for
her that she was bound to fail!

39:09.060 --> 39:13.087
And when she was at the edge of
that precipice, you did nothing.

39:14.532 --> 39:16.432
You let her fall.
No!

39:16.834 --> 39:19.098
I gave Doreen
everything she needed!

39:19.170 --> 39:22.230
She just never made the
effort! And when I saw this,

39:22.306 --> 39:25.070
I decided whatever Doreen
wants to do, I didn't care.

39:25.143 --> 39:28.635
But I never thought she'd take my
boys away from me, not for a minute!

39:28.713 --> 39:32.240
It's not my fault she did!
It's not my fault she's evil!

39:35.553 --> 39:41.719
Now see?
Now that, that's affect.

39:57.542 --> 40:00.272
"So what?"
A jury will love that.

40:00.344 --> 40:03.677
What jury? I didn't hear
a chargeable offense in there.

40:03.748 --> 40:07.878
Well, you heard him admit that he
knew that she was a threat to herself.

40:07.952 --> 40:09.920
You heard him say
that he didn't care.

40:09.987 --> 40:12.251
But he didn't aid or cause
her suicide attempt.

40:12.323 --> 40:17.886
He made her... He made her feel guilty
about her son's learning disability.

40:17.962 --> 40:20.328
That does not
constitute a crime.

40:20.398 --> 40:22.889
No, but it makes me wish
he was driving that car.

40:22.967 --> 40:24.457
He could have
prevented this crime,

40:24.535 --> 40:26.765
but he won't take
responsibility for that!

40:26.838 --> 40:28.203
Mr. Carver!

40:37.281 --> 40:42.218
Isn't there something in this book that
can make him take responsibility for that?

40:42.754 --> 40:45.587
There wasn't when I checked
this morning.

40:46.124 --> 40:49.821
I'm sorry, Detective.
Please send Mr. Whitlock home.

40:55.099 --> 40:58.796
Home. So he can start
designing his son's new life.

41:14.719 --> 41:17.279
I got them
ice cream sandwiches.

41:17.355 --> 41:18.879
That's what
they like the best.

41:20.625 --> 41:24.288
Then I started the car
and got back on the road.

41:26.264 --> 41:28.698
Adam was playing
with the windows.

41:29.267 --> 41:33.328
I started to scold him,
but then I stopped.

41:36.607 --> 41:39.940
I told him we were taking
the hard way to heaven,

41:40.011 --> 41:42.912
but it would be worth
it when we got there.

41:45.082 --> 41:47.744
Then all of a sudden,
I couldn't hear.

41:52.256 --> 41:53.883
And I'm so sorry.

41:56.194 --> 41:58.492
Oh, I'm so sorry, my babies.

42:00.298 --> 42:02.493
I would never hurt my babies.

42:12.210 --> 42:14.804
Mr. Carver,
are the People satisfied?

42:17.281 --> 42:18.578
Yes, Your Honor, we are.

42:18.649 --> 42:20.514
Then in accordance with
the plea agreement,

42:20.585 --> 42:24.214
I sentence the defendant to
a term no less than 25 years,

42:24.288 --> 42:28.987
to be served at a facility to be
determined by the Department of Correction.

42:29.060 --> 42:30.652
We're adjourned.

42:41.172 --> 42:44.664
I noticed Doreen's vision of
heaven doesn't include her husband.

42:44.742 --> 42:47.040
He doesn't have the stomach
for the sentencing.

42:47.111 --> 42:51.070
He might have a date in Family
Court. He filed for divorce yesterday.

42:51.148 --> 42:53.946
Must be in a hurry
to rebuild his family.

42:55.253 --> 42:57.380
Well, it won't include Adam.

43:05.596 --> 43:06.585
Who's that?

43:06.664 --> 43:09.132
Friend of his.
Children's rights attorney.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.430
Specializes in custody cases.

43:11.903 --> 43:12.892
Hmm.

43:17.775 --> 43:19.140
Thank you.
