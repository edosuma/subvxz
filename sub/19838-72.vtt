<b>We are no different from the Ants.</b>

00:09.150 --> 00:09.860
<b>No...</b>

00:10.340 --> 00:12.110
<b>We are far worse.</b>

01:36.540 --> 01:38.700
<b>The rose was poisonous.</b>

01:39.900 --> 01:44.510
<b>The poison, which spread 
when the rose bloomed,</b>

01:44.510 --> 01:47.710
<b>was superior to similar toxins</b>

01:48.070 --> 01:53.960
<b>because it was immediately absorbed by 
those in the area unfortunate enough</b>

01:53.960 --> 01:55.460
<b>to survive the explosion.</b>

01:56.090 --> 01:59.710
<b>Rapid destruction of their organs would begin,</b>

01:59.710 --> 02:01.460
<b>and their bodies themselves</b>

02:01.460 --> 02:08.000
<b>would become poisons that continued to 
emit new poison, until the victim died.</b>

02:08.000 --> 02:12.720
<b>The amount of poison for a lethal dose and 
the amount of time until the subject died</b>

02:12.720 --> 02:16.490
<b>perfectly created a chain of poisoned victims.</b>

02:17.780 --> 02:18.990
<b>In other words,</b>

02:27.830 --> 02:33.000
<b>it was a demonic weapon 
more inhumane than any other.</b>

<b>Pouf.</b>

04:29.400 --> 04:32.160
<b>Is something the matter, Meruem-sama?</b>

04:37.820 --> 04:41.370
<b>Have you changed your mind?</b>

04:42.350 --> 04:45.680
<b>In that case, we must evacuate you at once.</b>

04:48.120 --> 04:49.020

04:49.690 --> 04:51.890
<b><i>Even when I can see right through him,</i></b>

04:56.700 --> 04:57.940
<b>Very well.</b>

04:58.390 --> 05:03.500
<b>I only have to capture the remaining intruders.</b>

05:04.920 --> 05:08.660
<b>I am very curious about your secret now.</b>

05:09.310 --> 05:13.950
<b>You do not intend to change your

05:18.650 --> 05:22.420
<b>I will keep my word, even if it costs me my life.</b>

05:26.450 --> 05:27.470

<b><i>The footprints that were not there before.</i></b>

05:59.740 --> 06:01.880
<b><i>An abandoned vehicle.</i></b>

06:03.500 --> 06:05.310
<b><i>Youpi's corpse.</i></b>

06:06.840 --> 06:08.940
<b><i>A door that has been opened.</i></b>

06:10.500 --> 06:13.760
<b><i>And someone responding to my</i>

06:23.170 --> 06:24.410
<b><i>Huh?!</i></b>

06:29.980 --> 06:33.030
<b>Was it you who killed Youpi?</b>

06:35.680 --> 06:38.260
<b>A-Absolutely not!</b>

06:38.260 --> 06:40.320
<b>I am a mere Squadron Leader!</b>

06:40.320 --> 06:43.670
<b>I would never have any reason to kill Youpi-dono!</b>

06:45.530 --> 06:46.910
<b>Youpi-dono</b>

06:47.550 --> 06:51.440
<b>was talking to me when he 
suddenly coughed up blood,</b>

06:51.440 --> 06:54.170
<b>became overcome with pain, and died.</b>

06:54.170 --> 06:56.210
<b>I swear that I'm not lying!</b>

06:56.580 --> 06:58.060
<b><i>I'm not lying...</i></b>

06:58.390 --> 07:01.560
<b><i>Yes, I did attack Youpi.</i></b>

07:05.090 --> 07:09.780
<b><i>But before he could answer my question...</i></b>

07:10.900 --> 07:14.190
<b><i>Before my black centipedes could even hatch...</i></b>

07:15.100 --> 07:16.290
<b><i>He died.</i></b>

07:18.180 --> 07:20.840
<b>I believe that he must have been hit</b>

07:20.840 --> 07:24.910
<b>by some sort of attack before encountering me.</b>

07:24.910 --> 07:29.300
<b>That's why I came here to 
investigate if any intruders</b>

07:29.300 --> 07:31.720
<b>are hidden in the crowd.</b>

07:38.310 --> 07:40.070
<b><i>The Royal Guard Pouf...</i></b>

07:40.070 --> 07:42.110
<b><i>He's going to be trouble.</i></b>

07:42.110 --> 07:46.100
<b><i>I'm pretty sure he has the 
ability to read my mind.</i></b>

07:46.880 --> 07:49.370
<b><i>Welfin is a serious threat.</i></b>

07:50.080 --> 07:52.690
<b><i>I have no idea what he might tell the King...</i></b>

07:52.690 --> 07:55.500
<b><i>Simply telling him to keep quiet 
would be too lenient.</i></b>

07:56.050 --> 07:58.510
<b><i>I should eliminate him immediately!</i></b>

07:59.120 --> 08:02.340
<b><i>I should accuse him of being a traitor, 
and execute him on the spot.</i></b>

08:03.160 --> 08:06.120
<b><i>In any case, I must get him away from the King.</i></b>

08:09.030 --> 08:10.830
<b>Meruem-sama, he isâ€”</b>

08:10.830 --> 08:13.050
<b>I know what you want to say.</b>

08:14.480 --> 08:18.480
<b>I can now sense the emotions of 
any that my <i>En</i> has touched.</b>

08:18.880 --> 08:22.350
<b>I could feel his unbridled hostility toward me.</b>

08:24.820 --> 08:25.810
<b><i>In...</i></b>

08:26.710 --> 08:27.860
<b><i>Incredible...</i></b>

08:28.500 --> 08:31.940
<b>Once someone has been exposed to my <i>En</i>,</b>

08:32.640 --> 08:35.360
<b>I can see into their mind by simply looking.</b>

08:36.730 --> 08:39.800
<b><i>So it wasn't just Youpi's wings and attacks.</i></b>

08:40.370 --> 08:42.870
<b><i>The King also inherited my Spiritual Message...</i></b>

08:43.420 --> 08:48.160
<b><i>And he's made it infinitely more powerful.</i></b>

08:50.740 --> 08:51.960
<b><i>Your Majesty!</i></b>

08:53.300 --> 08:54.710
<b><i>The King is invincible...</i></b>

08:55.350 --> 08:56.980
<b><i>The King is unrivaled!</i></b>

08:58.480 --> 08:59.690
<b><i>And yet...</i></b>

09:03.000 --> 09:04.550
<b><i>Why?!</i></b>

09:06.370 --> 09:09.250
<b><i>Why is my heart</i></b>

09:11.270 --> 09:13.040
<b><i>filled with</i></b>

09:13.830 --> 09:15.740
<b><i>such unease?</i></b>

09:18.070 --> 09:21.990
<b>Now there is some fear mixed in,</b>

09:22.410 --> 09:27.500
<b>but there is no concealing 
your desire to kill me.</b>

09:28.750 --> 09:31.020
<b>I am interested to learn</b>

09:31.930 --> 09:35.260
<b>what drives your hatred of me.</b>

09:38.550 --> 09:40.140
<b>Speak.</b>

09:40.810 --> 09:42.880
<b>Lie, and you will regret it.</b>

09:45.960 --> 09:48.770
<b><i>This is no time to let emotion 
get the better of me!</i></b>

09:50.040 --> 09:51.730
<b>Tell me what you know.</b>

09:53.520 --> 09:54.780
<b>Meruem-sama!</b>

09:58.360 --> 10:00.480
<b>You must follow the proper order.</b>

10:15.330 --> 10:19.290
<b>He has deep ties to my secret.</b>

10:19.810 --> 10:21.800
<b>However, he does not realize this.</b>

10:24.870 --> 10:27.310
<b>If you continue questioning him,</b>

10:27.310 --> 10:31.560
<b>it is very likely that he will reveal</b>

10:31.950 --> 10:36.070
<b>part, or all, of my secret.</b>

10:36.430 --> 10:39.820
<b><i>When the King has such power, lies are futile.</i></b>

10:40.460 --> 10:42.190
<b><i>Then I must use the truth!</i></b>

10:43.130 --> 10:47.230
<b>I believe that you would not want your reward</b>

10:47.230 --> 10:49.580
<b>before winning the contest.</b>

10:50.140 --> 10:52.840
<b><i>I will keep my secret hidden using only truth!</i></b>

10:53.820 --> 10:57.180
<b>If you wish to continue our contest,</b>

10:57.940 --> 11:02.490
<b>I believe you should wait to question him.</b>

11:03.220 --> 11:06.760
<b><i>What is this guy talking about?</i></b>

11:07.190 --> 11:09.720
<b><i>Secret? What secret?</i></b>

11:09.720 --> 11:13.040
<b><i>Wait, what do I do now?</i></b>

11:13.380 --> 11:17.040
<b><i>How do I escape from this monster?</i></b>

11:17.660 --> 11:19.160
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

11:19.160 --> 11:22.120
<b><i>I didn't realize he was this powerful!</i></b>

11:22.120 --> 11:24.510
<b><i>I should have run away right off the bat.</i></b>

11:24.510 --> 11:26.620
<b><i>Temptation got the better of me!</i></b>

11:27.270 --> 11:32.500
<b><i>When I saw the giant Youpi 
shrunken down like some bug,</i></b>

11:32.500 --> 11:34.590
<b><i>and then he dropped dead,</i></b>

11:34.590 --> 11:38.910
<b><i>I actually had the delusion that I could be King...</i></b>

11:38.910 --> 11:40.300
<b><i>So I stayed...</i></b>

11:40.300 --> 11:42.040
<b><i>I was drunk on my delusion!</i></b>

11:44.110 --> 11:46.780
<b><i>I felt almighty, like some sheltered little kid.</i></b>

11:46.780 --> 11:48.560
<b><i>I felt alive.</i></b>

11:48.560 --> 11:52.020
<b><i>Yeah, I'm an idiot! I was drunk!</i></b>

11:53.700 --> 11:57.880
<b><i>Too many things happened simultaneously, 
and then I remembered Gyro.</i></b>

11:57.880 --> 12:01.360
<b><i>I panicked and got sentimental, 
and wanted to be a hero!</i></b>

12:02.160 --> 12:04.800
<b><i>I thought I could avenge Gyro.</i></b>

12:05.610 --> 12:08.070
<b><i>But Gyro isn't even dead...</i></b>

12:08.070 --> 12:09.870
<b><i>He's alive, for sure!</i></b>

12:10.290 --> 12:11.610
<b><i>I should have run,</i></b>

12:11.610 --> 12:15.430
<b><i>and teamed up with him again 
before seeking revenge!</i></b>

12:16.470 --> 12:17.680
<b><i>Damn it!</i></b>

12:17.680 --> 12:19.380
<b><i>It's that octopus's fault.</i></b>

12:19.380 --> 12:22.630
<b><i>He threw me off my game.</i></b>

12:22.630 --> 12:24.260
<b><i>He threw my emotions out of whack.</i></b>

12:25.010 --> 12:27.280
<b><i>He led me astray!</i></b>

12:27.280 --> 12:29.260
<b><i>Damn him! "Messenger," my eye!</i></b>

12:30.140 --> 12:33.640
<b><i>I have to do something. 
He knows my intent is hostile.</i></b>

12:33.640 --> 12:35.200
<b><i>And I can't lie...</i></b>

12:35.570 --> 12:39.530
<b><i>He'll send my head flying before 
I can activate Missile Man!</i></b>

12:40.950 --> 12:43.280
<b><i>What tools do I have left?</i></b>

12:45.030 --> 12:46.080
<b><i>The message?</i></b>

12:46.450 --> 12:47.780
<b><i>Pouf's secret?</i></b>

12:48.170 --> 12:49.790
<b><i>The drive behind my hatred?</i></b>

12:50.330 --> 12:52.560
<b><i>Everything that I know?</i></b>

12:53.330 --> 12:55.830
<b><i>Will it be enough to save me? What do I say?</i></b>

12:56.470 --> 12:57.890
<b><i>The first...</i></b>

12:59.060 --> 13:01.190
<b><i>The first word I say is key.</i></b>

13:01.700 --> 13:05.230
<b><i>Just one word will decide 
whether I live or die.</i></b>

13:06.160 --> 13:10.060
<b><i>If I choose the wrong one, it's all over!</i></b>

13:16.780 --> 13:18.280
<b><i>This overwhelming pressure.</i></b>

13:18.660 --> 13:20.770
<b><i>This abnormal tension.</i></b>

13:21.380 --> 13:24.280
<b>Pouf, does that secret</b>

13:25.300 --> 13:28.810
<b>have any relationship to the hatred</b>

13:32.100 --> 13:34.290
<b>he feels toward me?</b>

13:35.360 --> 13:36.790
<b><i>This is the King...</i></b>

13:39.100 --> 13:43.230
<b>After interrupting me in the 
middle of my questioning,</b>

13:43.690 --> 13:45.790
<b>you gave me a direct order.</b>

13:46.710 --> 13:49.300
<b>I presume that you are prepared 
to accept the consequences.</b>

13:51.590 --> 13:53.500
<b>I want a sincere answer.</b>

13:54.430 --> 13:55.430
<b><i>This is...</i></b>

13:57.160 --> 13:59.660
<b>The King's new power meant that</b>

13:59.660 --> 14:02.430
<b>he could probe for the answer he sought</b>

14:02.430 --> 14:04.690
<b>without waiting for Pouf to speak.</b>

14:05.650 --> 14:09.070
<b>Despite the understanding that he 
had Pouf's unwavering loyalty,</b>

14:09.400 --> 14:14.420
<b>the murderous aura visibly 
emanating from the King</b>

14:14.420 --> 14:17.460
<b>indicated that Pouf would have no choice</b>

14:17.760 --> 14:23.810
<b>but to atone with his death if that answer 
was not what the King wanted.</b>

14:25.170 --> 14:27.900
<b>Loyalty and hostility</b>

14:28.350 --> 14:32.260
<b>were equally meaningless before the King.</b>

14:33.210 --> 14:34.680
<b>No one could stop him.</b>

14:39.710 --> 14:41.050
<b><i>Even then,</i></b>

14:43.310 --> 14:44.730
<b><i>I was already</i></b>

14:46.210 --> 14:49.500
<b><i>prepared to die.</i></b>

14:52.380 --> 14:53.780
<b><i>I will sacrifice myself</i></b>

14:55.790 --> 14:57.880
<b><i>to my own loyalty.</i></b>

15:00.370 --> 15:04.290
<b><i>There is nothing that I can say.</i></b>

15:06.840 --> 15:08.550
<b><i>Though the contest has yet to conclude.</i></b>

15:12.910 --> 15:16.230
<b><i>That is all there is to it...</i></b>

15:26.080 --> 15:30.020
<b>His incredible resolve and madness</b>

15:34.370 --> 15:36.020
<b>stopped the King.</b>

15:46.130 --> 15:47.780
<b>I am hungry.</b>

15:50.640 --> 15:51.840
<b>However...</b>

15:55.770 --> 15:58.450
<b>Welfin immediately understood...</b>

15:59.350 --> 16:00.350
<b><i>I am...</i></b>

16:02.930 --> 16:04.860
<b><i>I am going to be eaten!</i></b>

16:09.530 --> 16:11.860
<b>One second later...</b>

16:17.210 --> 16:18.350
<b><i>I'm dead!</i></b>

16:20.320 --> 16:23.790
<b>Upon learning his fate,</b>

16:23.790 --> 16:28.270
<b>Welfin instantly appeared 
to age one hundred years.</b>

16:29.310 --> 16:30.510
<b><i>I want to live.</i></b>

16:34.670 --> 16:39.770
<b>That was when his past rapidly 
flashed through his mind</b>

16:39.770 --> 16:43.990
<b>and then scattered, the fragments 
mingling with his present.</b>

16:45.450 --> 16:46.480
<b><i>One word...</i></b>

16:48.600 --> 16:49.810
<b><i>My first</i></b>

16:51.580 --> 16:52.840
<b><i>and last!</i></b>

16:53.790 --> 16:58.230
<b>Caught between the desire to live 
and unavoidable death...</b>

17:00.850 --> 17:01.910
<b><i>One word...</i></b>

17:02.610 --> 17:05.420
<b><i>The message for the King!</i></b>

17:06.310 --> 17:07.420
<b><i>One word!</i></b>

17:08.180 --> 17:09.920
<b><i>What Pouf discussed with Pitou!</i></b>

17:10.870 --> 17:11.920
<b><i>One word!</i></b>

17:12.590 --> 17:13.670
<b><i>Pouf's secret!</i></b>

17:14.520 --> 17:15.680
<b><i>One word!</i></b>

17:16.370 --> 17:17.180
<b><i>I...</i></b>

17:17.770 --> 17:18.680
<b><i>One word!</i></b>

17:19.230 --> 17:21.430
<b><i>...won't die until I'm dead!</i></b>

17:23.310 --> 17:28.300
<b>As his brain cells began working 
harder than ever before,</b>

17:28.760 --> 17:32.440
<b>he made a choice that he never would 
have in normal circumstances.</b>

17:40.050 --> 17:41.880
<b>Komugi?</b>

18:44.560 --> 18:45.800
<b><i>This...</i></b>

18:46.820 --> 18:48.520
<b><i>This is...</i></b>

18:53.500 --> 18:57.330
<b><i>This is how deeply he values her!</i></b>

19:01.970 --> 19:02.910
<b>Pouf...</b>

19:05.060 --> 19:06.890
<b>This is your secret.</b>

19:08.270 --> 19:08.910
<b>Yes.</b>

19:11.070 --> 19:13.670
<b><i>He values her more than I feared.</i></b>

19:15.090 --> 19:17.000
<b>Punish me for my actions.</b>

19:22.510 --> 19:24.650
<b>No words are needed.</b>

19:25.370 --> 19:27.710
<b>We are one now.</b>

19:27.710 --> 19:29.290
<b>There will be no punishment.</b>

19:31.400 --> 19:33.520
<b><i>I never had a chance...</i></b>

19:35.740 --> 19:36.930
<b>Yes.</b>

19:36.930 --> 19:39.230
<b>Continue searching for Pitou.</b>

19:39.690 --> 19:42.770
<b>The two captured intruders 
may have information.</b>

19:43.260 --> 19:45.340
<b>Once you are done, release them.</b>

19:45.750 --> 19:48.430
<b>I have nothing else to ask them.</b>

19:50.670 --> 19:53.960
<b><i>All I can do is nod.</i></b>

19:55.070 --> 19:55.960
<b>Yes.</b>

19:57.090 --> 19:58.720
<b><i>The opened door...</i></b>

19:59.680 --> 20:01.950
<b><i>And footprints leading inside.</i></b>

20:02.830 --> 20:05.340
<b><i>The resolve of the two that I sensed with my </i>En.</b>

20:06.210 --> 20:08.470
<b><i>All signs lead to one conclusion.</i></b>

20:09.320 --> 20:10.500
<b>Welfin...</b>

20:12.580 --> 20:14.230
<b>Y-Yes!</b>

20:14.660 --> 20:19.580
<b>Komugi is in the underground warehouse 
with the woman and the octopus.</b>

20:20.030 --> 20:23.740
<b>Your job was to deliver that information 
to me or the Royal Guard.</b>

20:24.060 --> 20:26.110
<b>H-How did you know that?</b>

20:26.110 --> 20:30.980
<b>I believe the octopus was the 
reason you accepted this job.</b>

20:31.630 --> 20:35.500
<b>There was a different reason 
why you did not complete it.</b>

20:36.260 --> 20:39.880
<b>Is that reason the cause of your hatred for me?</b>

20:42.110 --> 20:43.380
<b>So it is.</b>

20:44.510 --> 20:45.730
<b>Do not worry.</b>

20:46.260 --> 20:49.640
<b>Once you answer my question, 
you are free to go wherever you wish.</b>

20:52.160 --> 20:53.440
<b>You have my thanks.</b>

20:53.850 --> 20:57.400
<b>You helped me to remember 
something very important.</b>

21:02.430 --> 21:06.280
<b>They said that they're waiting in Bizeff's 
private courtyard, in Area D.</b>

21:13.970 --> 21:16.770
<b>Gyro is the only man I'll ever call King!</b>

21:16.770 --> 21:18.790
<b>You... All of you...</b>

21:19.150 --> 21:20.520
<b>Are enemies!</b>

21:20.520 --> 21:22.310
<b>Our enemies!</b>

21:24.400 --> 21:25.550
<b>Is that so?</b>

21:28.950 --> 21:32.000
<b>I hope you find him...</b>

21:32.980 --> 21:34.810
<b>And if possible,</b>

21:36.630 --> 21:38.690
<b>I hope you can live as a human.</b>

21:50.040 --> 21:51.720
<b>Netero once believed</b>

21:52.150 --> 21:56.700
<b>that the King was wavering 
between human and Ant.</b>

21:57.090 --> 21:59.150
<b>But now...</b>

23:25.290 --> 23:28.280
<b>Next time: This Person x And x This Moment.</b>

23:28.280 --> 23:29.590
<b>Will you call me</b>

23:30.260 --> 23:31.750
<b>by my name?</b>

23:31.750 --> 23:33.990
<b>Huh? Me?</b>
