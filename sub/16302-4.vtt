Oh. Thanks, guys. Bye.

Bye?

Huh. [ Alarm beeping ]

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
It's 4:59 and 15 seconds.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
We've got to clean this place up before Omnibus gets here,

Is something funny, dear brother?

[ Both laughing ]

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
What's so funny, if I may be so bold?

Oh, we broke all your stuff! [ Laughs ]

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
We're really sorry about it, okay?

All of my stuff? Broken?! All of it?!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
Well, not all of it exactly. Just one or two teensy tiny...

[ Stifles laugh ] Yeah, all of it.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000

Okay, now he's laughing. This just got real and I'm scared.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
So you're not angry?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
No. You see, I just bought doubles of everything I own

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
at the antique show.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I had so much fun buying everything the first time,

I thought I'd really live it up and buy it all over again.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
So you're not gonna turn us into toads?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Heavens, no! That was the best laugh I've had in years!

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And besides, I still have all my stuff.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
But tell me, how did you happen to cause

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
of all this destruction?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Oh, we let a jester named Jest-o in out of the rain,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
and his Taunting Jester Magisword

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
hypnotized us into wrecking absolutely everything.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
You know, when you say it like that,

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
it makes it sound improbable? -Oh, that's very strange.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
The only Jest-o I know of is my prized statue!

Oh, it's very, um, spooky. Yes, yes, it -- it matches

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
your drapes very nicely.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
Spooky's the word I was...yeah, yeah, it's, um, it's amazing.

Uh, so do we still get paid?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Of course not!

I hired you to guard my things, and you broke them instead!

Then you laughed. It was weird. No money, my dear boy.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I dig.
