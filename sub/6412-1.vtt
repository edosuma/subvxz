01:39.010 --> 01:41.773
I swear!

01:41.836 --> 01:44.567
Goddamn it!

01:44.640 --> 01:48.206
Oh, no!

02:53.303 --> 02:56.024
- So who do you think is the enemy?

02:56.139 --> 03:00.100
- No, no, give me a specific answer.
- You are the goddamn enemy, Capa.

03:00.205 --> 03:03.770
You and this whole tower
of psychobabble.

03:03.843 --> 03:07.648
You know what I hope?
That God gets real pissed off...

03:07.721 --> 03:12.872
and He shrivels up your cock so that it
points straight down to hell, where you belong!

03:12.955 --> 03:16.218
Okay, Michelle.

03:16.281 --> 03:20.316
Before you become His avenging angel
and swoop down to finish me off.

03:20.398 --> 03:23.297
Now I finally get it.
You are like my ex-husband.

03:23.359 --> 03:27.551
You think that everything's gotta be either
black or white 'cause you gone color-blind.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.292
But God's
on my side now.

03:30.408 --> 03:32.733
He knows I'm not like you.

03:32.805 --> 03:36.830
Well, we're all pretty much the same,
Michelle. We all do it.

03:36.903 --> 03:39.676
We all do what?

03:39.738 --> 03:42.574
Tend to view our lives
as if we're looking through a keyhole.

03:44.242 --> 03:46.244
It's a very limited view
of the truth.

03:46.306 --> 03:49.539
So we have to
fill in the blanks.

03:49.622 --> 03:54.084
- We invent things.
- I don't know what you mean.

03:54.146 --> 03:56.554
You invent enemies to test
your strength against.

03:56.617 --> 03:59.016
You invent gods to protect
you from these enemies.

03:59.088 --> 04:00.652
What a depressing
view of life you have!

04:00.757 --> 04:03.019
- That is such horseshit!
- Who is the enemy?

04:03.133 --> 04:07.158
One minute you have friends.
The next moment, they've slipped away.

04:07.272 --> 04:11.171
You leave here and I wonder,
"Who's Michelle hating this week?"

04:11.234 --> 04:13.256
I try to remember,
and I can't.

04:14.706 --> 04:17.103
Can't bring 'em to mind.
Do you know why?

04:17.177 --> 04:20.606
- No. Why don't you tell me?
- Take a look in the mirror, Michelle.

04:22.546 --> 04:24.516
Which mirror?
This mirror?

04:24.578 --> 04:27.676
Any mirror.
Tell me what you see.

04:27.748 --> 04:30.115
I see...

04:30.187 --> 04:33.242
your reflection over my shoulder.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.725
- I see...

04:38.456 --> 04:40.957
there's nothin' much
that I really like.

04:41.061 --> 04:43.897
I think I prefer
the view outside, actually.

04:46.003 --> 04:50.861
Michelle!

05:08.252 --> 05:12.652
- All right, get back there.

05:12.724 --> 05:15.122
- Stay back.

05:15.185 --> 05:18.062
Get back in your car!

05:22.900 --> 05:25.162
Stop it.

05:25.235 --> 05:27.164
Michelle.

05:30.604 --> 05:32.908
Oh, my God.

05:32.981 --> 05:38.110
It was the reddest blood I ever saw,
pooled around her green dress.

05:38.173 --> 05:40.113
And then the red disappeared.

05:41.613 --> 05:45.043
Christ, Ed. It was like
a vibration of color...

05:45.147 --> 05:47.817
broadcast from hell.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.475
And then the red
started to fade away.

05:58.295 --> 06:00.765
Poor Capa.
You here for me to pity you?

06:00.838 --> 06:02.997
Hell, yes.
Doesn't take Sigmund Freud...

06:03.059 --> 06:07.094
to figure out that I don't care
to see the color of my patient's blood.

06:07.177 --> 06:09.575
I'm a little surprised
that this happened to you.

06:09.637 --> 06:13.599
Sure. You always thought I was
a coldhearted son-of-a-bitch.

06:13.714 --> 06:16.967
Not really, but there is
a kind of arrogance here.

06:19.083 --> 06:23.378
Do you really believe that you
are responsible for her illness?

06:23.452 --> 06:26.183
You were a small,
recent part of her life.

06:26.245 --> 06:28.686
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.

06:28.758 --> 06:31.323
Well, it's all too fucking
glib for me, Larry.

06:31.385 --> 06:33.992
I cannot dispose of
this woman that easily.

06:34.054 --> 06:37.088
Well, you always
were a romantic.

06:39.601 --> 06:42.728
- Are you involved with anyone else?
- No.

06:44.594 --> 06:46.941
But I'm still a romantic.

06:48.734 --> 06:51.340
I just don't have anybody
to be romantic with.

06:52.810 --> 06:55.208
They all want to fuck me
or marry me.

06:55.280 --> 06:58.106
- None of 'em want to love me.
- Maybe you don't want to be loved.

06:58.179 --> 07:00.733
- You had a happy marriage once.

07:00.817 --> 07:02.683
She loved me to death.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.520
- And then she ran off and loved somebody else to death.
- Of course...

07:06.582 --> 07:09.074
there's something
else here.

07:09.158 --> 07:12.598
To deny red
is to deny emotion.

07:12.661 --> 07:15.955
- Oh, yeah.
- As you know, that can be very dangerous.

07:16.038 --> 07:18.051
Yes, yes, I know.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.605
Very dangerous.

07:20.699 --> 07:22.637
I know...

07:22.700 --> 07:26.068
that I've got
something broken.

07:26.140 --> 07:30.873
- And I know that it's gonna take some time to get it fixed.
- You're a pretty good therapist.

07:30.947 --> 07:34.429
How long does it take
a man like you to forgive himself?

07:37.577 --> 07:40.235
I'll see you when
I get back from Los Angeles.

07:40.319 --> 07:45.220
Don't run away because
of one treatment failure.

07:45.293 --> 07:48.618
I'm not running away, Larry.
It's just a little trip to Los Angeles.

07:48.691 --> 07:52.455
Besides, I can't
really run away.

07:53.758 --> 07:56.458
It's all up here,
isn't it? Pow.

07:56.573 --> 08:00.524
It's a package deal.
The head goes with me.

08:03.307 --> 08:05.425
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Los Angeles.

08:05.507 --> 08:07.697
Please remain seated
until the aircraft comes...

08:07.780 --> 08:10.209
Just another Monday in paradise.

08:10.272 --> 08:13.108
There's a fender bender on
the 405, slowing things down...

08:13.181 --> 08:15.662
Hey, jerk-off, what
are you looking at?

08:15.746 --> 08:18.018
See that? There's accident.
Hey, what happened?

08:18.081 --> 08:22.575
- Anybody's hurt? Huh? Anybody's dead?

08:22.657 --> 08:26.088
What are you doing?
You are looking there and driving here?

08:26.192 --> 08:29.424
Put the pedal on the metal!
Asshole!

08:38.462 --> 08:41.736
- Is the aquarium with it?
- That's a blue shark.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.291
- Okay.

08:44.374 --> 08:48.076
Thirty-three and three is...

08:48.138 --> 08:50.411
Was that an aftershock
I felt?

08:52.746 --> 08:54.978
Forty-four, forty-five.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.480
- Five.
- Thirty-eight. Fourteen.

08:59.585 --> 09:01.848
- Thirty-three.
- Two.

09:01.952 --> 09:04.954
- Thirteen. - Three.

09:05.058 --> 09:07.644
- Twenty-nine. Three hundred and four.
- Casey, you're such a weenie.

09:07.759 --> 09:10.344
- Leave him alone, will you?
- Seven.

09:10.428 --> 09:13.326
- Eight.
- Clark.

09:13.399 --> 09:16.632
- Yeah.
- Did you read the paper today?

09:16.693 --> 09:20.572
- No.
- I was just wondering how many fuckin' pages it had.

09:23.908 --> 09:26.640
- Oh, Christ, I fell right into that.
- Sixteen.

09:26.702 --> 09:29.976
- Four. Forty-seven.
- I care that he's late.

09:30.049 --> 09:34.312
- I don't get it.
- I do too. Why not?

09:34.417 --> 09:36.346
Because his father's
paying for his therapy.

09:36.419 --> 09:39.401
My dead husband's paying
for mine, and I still care.

09:42.591 --> 09:45.186
Aww, unbelievable.

09:45.249 --> 09:47.887
I think we should
get started now. Clark?

09:54.935 --> 09:58.532
- Hey, Bob!
- God. Bill.

09:58.604 --> 10:02.305
- Hey. How you doin'? You look great.
- I'm good. Good, yeah.

10:02.368 --> 10:05.569
I'm sorry I'm late. I got stuck
in traffic on the freeway.

10:05.684 --> 10:09.134
- We're just about to get started.
- I'll wait out here for you.

10:09.249 --> 10:12.439
- Why don't you join us?
- You know, this is the last thing I need right now...

10:12.523 --> 10:15.848
- I'm serious. I could use a second opinion. Come on.
- No, look, Bob...

10:15.921 --> 10:21.582
This is my friend and colleague, Bill Capa, from
New York. Why don't you sit over there, Bill?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.585
I thought it might be interesting
for you and for him...

10:24.658 --> 10:27.859
if he sat in
on one of our sessions.

10:27.931 --> 10:30.131
What kind of a shrink
are you?

10:30.194 --> 10:32.133
I'm a behaviorist.

10:32.196 --> 10:36.262
- Qualifications?
- Same as Bob. We went to college together.

10:36.335 --> 10:41.234
Then we fought the battle of Penn State
Mental Hospital as interns.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.748
- No one's going to be offended if you want to say no.
- No, Bob.

10:44.811 --> 10:49.304
- Nobod... Nobody wants to say no.
- Oh, Jesus.

10:52.911 --> 10:57.353
- I'm Sondra. How are you, Bill?
- Fine, thank you, Sondra.

10:57.426 --> 11:01.617
- Medical degree?
- No. I'm a psychologist...

11:01.689 --> 11:04.599
and a psychoanalyst,
not a psychiatrist.

11:04.661 --> 11:07.090
The Ph. D. Is from NYU.

11:09.009 --> 11:13.690
- Okay, thank you. That's fine.
- So it's Bill and Bob. Therapy a deux.

11:13.805 --> 11:16.598
- Really.
- Why don't we begin...

11:16.672 --> 11:20.445
by introducing ourselves and then saying
as much or as little about why we're here...

11:20.508 --> 11:23.031
- as we're comfortable with.

11:23.114 --> 11:26.242
- Name's Buck. - Oh, that's helpful.
Very macho of you.

11:26.315 --> 11:28.410
That's an
anti-gender remark.

11:28.483 --> 11:31.424
Sondra? Sondra,
why don't you start us off?

11:31.475 --> 11:34.395
Okay.

11:34.447 --> 11:37.648
Um...

11:37.720 --> 11:39.691
My name is Sondra Dorio.

11:39.764 --> 11:43.288
And, uh...

11:43.360 --> 11:46.593
I always marry older men, but...

11:48.032 --> 11:50.367
I'm single now...

11:50.440 --> 11:54.099
...and I keep, uh...
Well, I...

11:56.581 --> 11:59.771
I want sex
all the time.

12:00.907 --> 12:03.702
But I mean,
I really do...

12:03.774 --> 12:06.579
want a real relationship.

12:06.641 --> 12:08.779
And, um, sometimes...

12:10.082 --> 12:12.010
I- I steal things.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.181
I mean, they're little things.

12:16.254 --> 12:20.956
Doesn't make any sense. It's hard to...
You know, I... Is that okay?

12:21.059 --> 12:24.250
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

12:24.365 --> 12:27.232
- Richie?
- This will be an event.

12:27.304 --> 12:29.463
Richie!

12:29.536 --> 12:32.590
What?

12:32.674 --> 12:36.136
Would you like to tell Bill
a little something about yourself?

12:36.208 --> 12:38.137
No.

12:41.515 --> 12:45.414
Okay. Nobody else
is going to do it. I will.

12:46.926 --> 12:50.106
Richie has
a gender identity problem...

12:50.188 --> 12:53.045
and a social phobia...

12:53.161 --> 12:57.456
- and he's promised the group not to wear the Walkman in group...
- Thank you, Dr. Clark.

12:57.528 --> 13:01.188
- To lay the inventory on.
- Oh, St. Christopher rattles his chains.

13:01.261 --> 13:03.961
- St. Michael, sir.
- This is not about you!

13:04.023 --> 13:06.327
You're right.
You know what I'm saying?

13:06.401 --> 13:11.666
I- I-I'll open
my-my mouth...

13:11.739 --> 13:13.678
to talk...

13:13.741 --> 13:17.682
b- but nothing h-happens.

13:17.744 --> 13:21.267
Except for when I...
when I do drugs.

13:22.383 --> 13:25.646
I- I c-can't talk...

13:25.751 --> 13:30.588
so that's...
how come I'm here.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.758
Th-They say that I-I...

13:34.821 --> 13:37.386
That I blush too.

13:37.469 --> 13:39.690
Y- You c-can say that again.

13:39.763 --> 13:42.285
Fuck you!

13:42.358 --> 13:45.424
Fuck! Fuck you!

13:45.507 --> 13:48.135
I'll tear your
fuckin' head off!

13:48.207 --> 13:50.636
- You fuckin' cocksucker!
- Get up!

13:50.699 --> 13:54.139
Get the fuck
off me!

13:54.212 --> 13:56.142
- Buck.
- Richie!

13:56.214 --> 13:59.228
It's all right.
He'll come back.

13:59.353 --> 14:04.481
- What do you think, Dr. Clark?
- Was it something I said?

14:04.575 --> 14:07.349
- You are an asshole.

14:07.422 --> 14:11.518
- You know, guys, a little humanity.
- Funny. Oh, fuckin' laugh.

14:11.592 --> 14:14.250
We're entertaining
the shit out of you, aren't we?

14:14.334 --> 14:16.263
Stop being responsible
for everyone.

14:16.325 --> 14:19.296
- Why don't you stop wound-licking,
Sondra? - That's very nice.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.364
Buck.

14:25.437 --> 14:28.930
I lost my wife
and daughter.

14:31.275 --> 14:34.539
And I just can't seem
to get past it. All right?

14:34.643 --> 14:38.010
I'm very sorry.
How did they die?

14:38.073 --> 14:40.012
They say...

14:44.912 --> 14:47.613
I... I can't
talk about it.

14:53.721 --> 14:55.661
Casey?

14:55.734 --> 14:57.662
I am Casey Heinz.

14:57.736 --> 15:01.249
I am a painter.
I live in a loft, downtown.

15:01.333 --> 15:05.659
And I guess
you could say...

15:05.774 --> 15:07.703
I'm alienated.

15:07.775 --> 15:11.258
- Can't you ever be serious?

15:11.372 --> 15:14.239
Does a bear poop in the woods?

15:14.313 --> 15:16.846
Sit next to Clark.

15:16.908 --> 15:18.847
And then smoke up a storm?

15:20.777 --> 15:23.810
My name is Clark.

15:23.893 --> 15:25.822
I'm a lawyer.

15:28.262 --> 15:30.315
And, uh...

15:30.389 --> 15:32.881
I'm an obsessive-compulsive
disorder.

15:32.963 --> 15:35.623
So what's the problem?

15:38.469 --> 15:41.899
The problem is that if you and Buck
are going to smoke in here...

15:42.003 --> 15:46.194
then the door to Dr. Moore's office
must remain open a minimum of 15 inches.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.206
I can't stand the smoke, okay?

15:48.279 --> 15:51.772
And I would also like to suggest
that you buy one of those ashtrays...

15:51.844 --> 15:54.441
that sucks up the smoke
and purifies 'em.

15:54.514 --> 15:58.173
- How come you don't do anything about this, Bob?
- They cost $9.99...

15:58.245 --> 16:01.186
half of which is
$4.99-point-5.

16:01.259 --> 16:05.190
- He's gonna open the door.
- One of you will pay an extra penny. You can work that out.

16:05.252 --> 16:07.723
- He's gonna open the door.
- I'm gonna open the door.

16:08.796 --> 16:11.767
You smell like an ashtray.

16:13.092 --> 16:16.960
You know, if you don't
act more serious in group...

16:17.032 --> 16:19.504
- Hi, Richie. - He's back.

16:19.608 --> 16:23.476
- He's back. - Next time
you get snot on the doorknob...

16:23.539 --> 16:25.874
- Come sit down here. - Bill.

16:25.947 --> 16:28.532
What would you like to tell us
about yourself?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.519
Well...

16:38.947 --> 16:41.324
I have plenty of problems...

16:41.387 --> 16:46.423
the biggest of which right now is jet
lag, so I think I'll pass for now, Bob.

16:48.361 --> 16:50.290
Fair enough.

16:50.364 --> 16:53.699
She's like a daughter to me.

16:53.773 --> 16:56.202
We hang out. Um...

16:56.296 --> 16:58.496
It's wonderful.

17:00.340 --> 17:03.041
Well, that's all
for tonight.

17:03.104 --> 17:05.031
I'll see you all
next week.

17:05.105 --> 17:07.137
Way to go.

17:07.211 --> 17:10.766
Uh, Bill, I'll be with you
in a couple of minutes, okay?

17:10.849 --> 17:12.872
- Bye. - Coffee, anyone?

17:12.944 --> 17:15.676
- Yeah. - Nine.

17:22.996 --> 17:26.185
- Have you read Bob's book?
- No, I haven't.

17:27.989 --> 17:30.418
It's really...
It's quite excellent.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.058
"Way To Go."

17:37.831 --> 17:40.635
- I'm glad to hear you liked it.
- Very much.

17:40.698 --> 17:43.138
- Good.
- Good night, Dr. Capa.

17:43.210 --> 17:45.139
Good night.

17:58.150 --> 18:01.090
- Alone at last.
- You okay?

18:01.164 --> 18:04.958
Well, nobody jumped out the window,
so maybe I'm makin' progress.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.891
- Wanna get a drink?
- Uh-huh.

18:11.964 --> 18:13.894
Wanna go get laid?

18:16.239 --> 18:18.365
No.

18:18.439 --> 18:20.409
So what do you think
of my little group?

18:20.471 --> 18:24.111
- What's Buck's story?
- You mean how did he lose his wife and kid?

18:24.173 --> 18:28.615
I don't know yet.
He's not talkin' yet. Either.

18:31.815 --> 18:34.244
- What about Casey?
- You tell me.

18:34.316 --> 18:37.914
Well, I smell money.
Lots of it.

18:37.987 --> 18:41.896
Maybe an abusive father.
How am I doin' so far?

18:41.959 --> 18:45.587
- A+.
- Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown...

18:45.660 --> 18:51.123
and the very expensive artistic lifestyle
as long as Junior stays in therapy.

18:51.206 --> 18:53.688
The hair on the back
of my neck's standin' up.

18:53.771 --> 18:56.201
Yeah, I'm a psychic
when it comes to masochists.

18:56.273 --> 19:00.026
- Five'll get you ten he likes to whack now and then.
- Where do you get that from?

19:00.141 --> 19:03.633
Ah, I was born with it.
I'm like a tuning fork.

19:03.738 --> 19:07.137
- What about Richie?
- Genuine nut case.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.680
- Dangerous?
- Volatile.

19:09.785 --> 19:12.047
- Don't fuck with a trapped rat.
- Oh, I see.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.781
Trapped rat syndrome with a
recommendation of a non-fuck-with therapy?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.261
- Can I quote ya on that?
- Yes, you may.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.889
- Just take notes. There'll be a pop quiz later.
- Okay, I'm ready.

19:22.963 --> 19:26.184
All right, if I diagnose
a schizophrenia, what do you recommend?

19:26.268 --> 19:28.791
- Don't fuck with it.
- Now you got it.

19:46.442 --> 19:48.380
Oh, man.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.585
This all one place?

19:59.025 --> 20:00.995
Goddamn.

20:08.157 --> 20:11.004
Like peekin'
through a keyhole.

20:13.798 --> 20:17.864
You get a very limited view
of the truth.

20:17.937 --> 20:19.876
What's that?

20:27.153 --> 20:30.083
Way To Go must have gone
really well.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.951
- Yeah.

20:36.630 --> 20:39.862
- After you, wise guy. Come on.
- Oh-ho-ho. Oh, man.

20:54.874 --> 20:58.304
So, how are we
as we approach 40?

20:59.514 --> 21:01.443
We're in, uh, good shape.

21:02.642 --> 21:04.581
Really good shape.

21:04.643 --> 21:07.772
We, uh, finally
got divorced.

21:07.854 --> 21:12.182
We have some money.
We're meticulous.

21:12.286 --> 21:15.986
- I don't detect a woman's touch.
- We have a little friend.

21:16.091 --> 21:18.583
Oh.

21:20.396 --> 21:22.555
You'll meet her.

21:26.475 --> 21:29.092
- She's too young for ya.
- Oh!

21:31.604 --> 21:34.273
Always guess the cliche,
and you won't be disappointed.

21:34.346 --> 21:37.370
This woman
is not a cliche.

21:37.443 --> 21:39.778
Thanks.

21:39.850 --> 21:42.280
- Good to see you, Bob.
- You too.

21:46.346 --> 21:50.850
So, uh,
you ready yet?

21:50.954 --> 21:53.748
Ready to what?

22:00.722 --> 22:02.599
It's a hard thing
to talk about.

22:04.236 --> 22:07.301
So hard to talk about.

22:07.364 --> 22:11.639
It's just a game.
A dumb, deceitful game.

22:11.711 --> 22:14.506
That's why
I quit my practice.

22:16.143 --> 22:19.301
Lost your religion, huh?

22:19.415 --> 22:22.814
Well, I've certainly lost
my belief in the scriptures.

22:30.519 --> 22:34.011
I'm sorry, buddy.
You gotta be in a lot of pain.

22:34.095 --> 22:37.181
There is a distinct
absence of pain.

22:37.265 --> 22:39.663
I can...

22:39.735 --> 22:43.322
I cannot feel the pain that I know
I am supposed to be feeling right now.

22:46.502 --> 22:48.566
And I think I'm goin' crazy.

22:50.838 --> 22:53.810
I've lost it, man.
I think that I am goin' crazy.

22:55.478 --> 22:58.783
You may be.

22:58.845 --> 23:03.005
Your mind may be shot,
but I hope your body isn't.

23:03.089 --> 23:05.946
- Do I get to warm up?
- Yeah.

23:06.018 --> 23:10.188
Two miles any pace you like and then,
uh, let's do ten.

23:10.261 --> 23:13.159
- Ten?
- Too much for ya, huh?

23:13.233 --> 23:15.588
Nah. Not enough.

23:15.662 --> 23:19.759
- I was thinkin' of maybe 20.
- Geez, Bill, you never change.

23:19.842 --> 23:23.065
Why don't we just drop our pants
and see who's got the bigger dick?

23:23.137 --> 23:27.370
- Then we can go back and have a nice, civilized breakfast.
- Wouldn't be civilized.

23:27.475 --> 23:29.403
- Why?
- You'd be sulkin'.

23:29.476 --> 23:31.707
Ahh.

23:31.780 --> 23:34.981
- They don't have hills in New York.
- Hang on a second.

23:35.044 --> 23:37.180
- Huh? What?
- Hang on a second.

23:37.243 --> 23:39.620
Hang on a second here.
What was that?

23:39.683 --> 23:41.611
What the hell
was that?

23:43.686 --> 23:49.483
- What are you afraid of?
- I think I got a gear slippin' here or somethin'.

23:49.566 --> 23:51.609
That's not
what I meant.

23:51.693 --> 23:55.853
What's with the security system, the
security gates, lookin' over your shoulder?

23:55.936 --> 23:59.189
- I been gettin' some threats.
- You mean death threats?

23:59.303 --> 24:01.931
Pretty sure it's somebody
in the Monday night group.

24:02.035 --> 24:04.798
- I just don't know who.
- Monday night as in last night?

24:04.871 --> 24:07.102
Yeah.

24:07.175 --> 24:10.574
I was hopin' maybe with your tuning
fork that you might have a hunch.

24:10.678 --> 24:13.649
No. No hunches, Bob.

24:13.711 --> 24:15.651
What makes you think
it's somebody in the group?

24:15.714 --> 24:20.050
Only about a dozen things. It's been
going on for a couple of months now.

24:20.124 --> 24:22.313
It's funny how it
gets to you after a while.

24:22.386 --> 24:24.252
- You call the cops?
- Yeah.

24:24.315 --> 24:28.557
They said if they had to protect every
shrink in L.A., they'd need an army.

24:28.631 --> 24:31.821
But that I should call 'em
if, uh, anything happens.

24:31.894 --> 24:34.156
Yeah. That makes sense.

24:34.271 --> 24:37.722
Yeah. It'll probably
all just blow over.

24:39.171 --> 24:41.434
- Yeah.
- How 'bout you?

24:41.506 --> 24:43.769
How 'bout me what?

24:43.841 --> 24:47.011
What do you give a suicidal patient
who's got everything?

24:47.074 --> 24:50.514
- A parachute. I heard it already.
- Out here already, huh?

24:50.577 --> 24:52.515
Come on, old-timer.

25:04.255 --> 25:06.246
Oh... shit.

25:06.361 --> 25:10.948
- You may have to...
You may have to carry me in.

25:11.063 --> 25:13.993
You know, you lose
a lot more gracefully than you used to.

25:14.065 --> 25:16.724
Yeah, well, you know,
practice and all.

25:16.807 --> 25:19.268
Hey, how 'bout that?
Learning To Lose, by Dr. Bill Capa.

25:19.330 --> 25:21.270
- Got a ring to it.

25:21.343 --> 25:24.001
They're makin' them seats
a little smaller, huh? Whoo!

25:24.137 --> 25:27.702
I'll see you
next week, all right?

25:27.785 --> 25:30.236
I'm goin' now.
You want me to lock up on the way out?

25:30.308 --> 25:32.248
That'd be great, Barbara.

26:30.203 --> 26:32.133
Just relax.

27:27.919 --> 27:29.818
Barbara?

27:56.643 --> 28:00.572
No!
No-o-o-o!

28:06.880 --> 28:08.819
Why?

29:02.636 --> 29:05.325
- Have you thought about...
- Man, I didn't do nothing.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.965
- Oh, please? You know, you're very cute.
- Yeah, I love you too.

29:09.027 --> 29:11.759
Relax.

29:13.469 --> 29:16.930
- You Capa?
- Yes, I'm Bill Capa.

29:18.285 --> 29:20.214
You're here because
of the dead doctor?

29:22.747 --> 29:24.676
Yes.

29:24.749 --> 29:28.481
Um, I read something
about sessions on Mondays?

29:28.554 --> 29:30.994
Tell me about
this Monday group.

29:32.255 --> 29:34.747
There's five patients
in the group.

29:34.861 --> 29:38.886
- I can't really remember their names right now.
- Like five cuckoos?

29:40.065 --> 29:42.962
No. Four neurotics
of varying degrees...

29:42.993 --> 29:46.059
and one killer.

29:46.142 --> 29:48.394
At least that's
what Bob thought.

29:48.467 --> 29:51.094
- Bob Moore?
- Good. Yes, Bob Moore.

29:51.178 --> 29:54.910
- Uh, four men and one woman.
- Right.

29:56.515 --> 29:59.174
And you sat in on
one of these sessions, right?

29:59.247 --> 30:01.301
Yes, I did.

30:01.384 --> 30:04.710
- So who did it? Hey, hey, hey!

30:04.783 --> 30:07.911
Anderson!
This is civilization, man!

30:08.026 --> 30:10.549
What do you think this is,
your bedroom? Damn!

30:10.653 --> 30:14.823
Knock! Knock! Don't come
into my office like that, bro. Hey!

30:19.765 --> 30:21.735
Whew.

30:21.797 --> 30:25.321
It's a Third World thing.

30:29.168 --> 30:32.702
- Where were we?
- You were probing me about the patients.

30:32.776 --> 30:36.144
I was about to tell you that I really
can't help you. I don't know these people.

30:36.206 --> 30:40.053
But you're a professional, like me.
You gotta have some kind of suspicion.

30:40.147 --> 30:43.775
I really don't have a clue.
I'd like to help you.

30:43.889 --> 30:47.288
Even if I could, there's
an issue of confidentiality.

30:48.894 --> 30:50.875
- Confidentiality?
- Yes.

30:53.085 --> 30:56.463
You're talkin' to me
about an issue of confidentiality?

30:56.525 --> 30:59.059
Similar to
the Miranda oath.

31:00.372 --> 31:02.301
If a friend of mine got killed...

31:02.363 --> 31:05.856
and the only thing between
the killer and me was Miranda...

31:05.940 --> 31:08.838
you know what I would do?

31:08.911 --> 31:10.839
I'd fuck Miranda
up the ass, okay?

31:10.902 --> 31:16.366
But don't tell anybody, because
it's a matter of confidentiality. Shh.

31:16.448 --> 31:18.502
Look, I'm sorry.

31:18.617 --> 31:21.776
I can't help ya. I've only been
in Los Angeles four days.

31:21.860 --> 31:26.227
You're sleeping in that...
dead guy's house, aren't you?

31:26.280 --> 31:28.750
- Yes.
- Maybe something will come to you in the night.

31:28.824 --> 31:34.453
You know, like dreams and shit. What
happens to patients in a situation like this?

31:34.537 --> 31:40.094
Usually a colleague will offer to take
over the group, continue the treatment.

31:40.167 --> 31:43.336
How sweet.
How sweet.

31:43.399 --> 31:46.057
It's like one of
the vultures dies...

31:46.141 --> 31:49.602
and then the others step in line
and eat his portion?

31:49.675 --> 31:51.646
Is that what you're planning?

31:51.708 --> 31:54.648
- No.
- Why not?

31:54.711 --> 31:58.109
- 'Cause I really can't handle that right now.
- Sure you can!

31:58.224 --> 32:03.051
Come on. You've been a week in L.A. You
already have your own private squirrel farm.

32:03.124 --> 32:06.679
How bad can that be?
That's a great career move.

32:06.762 --> 32:10.088
Where were you at the time
of the killing, Capa?

32:11.632 --> 32:13.685
I was at his house...
at Bob's house.

32:13.769 --> 32:16.458
You had to think
about that?

32:16.531 --> 32:19.701
Jesus Christ. You gonna arrest me,
Lieutenant Martinez?

32:19.795 --> 32:22.140
- You want a lawyer?
- Do I need a lawyer?

32:22.234 --> 32:25.435
You're in L.A.
Everybody needs a lawyer.

32:27.207 --> 32:29.104
Ay.

32:30.648 --> 32:35.110
You can go home now. Take a shower.
And keep your mouth shut.

32:35.183 --> 32:38.676
The only thing I got goin' for me
is that few people know what happened.

32:38.758 --> 32:40.813
I don't want the press
fucking things up.

33:09.305 --> 33:11.683
- All right, all right. Hold on.

33:19.189 --> 33:21.118
Oh, shit.

33:24.558 --> 33:28.092
- Capa? Capa, are you there?
- Yeah.

33:28.197 --> 33:30.532
- How's it going?
- What do you want?

33:30.595 --> 33:33.826
I brought the victim's car back,
and I gotta search the house.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.891
You got
a search warrant?

33:36.000 --> 33:41.571
What is it with you? Don't you want
me to find out who killed your friend?

33:41.645 --> 33:44.773
- No, I don't have a warrant.
- All right, come on in.

33:44.857 --> 33:47.257
- Open the gate.
- Yeah, right.

33:47.330 --> 33:50.658
- How's that?

33:51.856 --> 33:53.849
You got the sprinklers on.

33:56.133 --> 33:58.732
How 'bout that?

34:17.206 --> 34:19.898
Jill. His wife.

34:19.971 --> 34:22.538
- His ex-wife.
- Nice bush.

34:24.842 --> 34:26.773
I'll tell her
you said so.

34:29.286 --> 34:31.311
I'm sure it'll mean
a lot to her.

34:33.094 --> 34:35.056
Check this fucking bed.

34:37.058 --> 34:38.998
Damn.

34:42.899 --> 34:45.560
Everybody's having fun
but me, goddamn it.

34:55.888 --> 35:00.947
- I do not like guns.
- You prefer knives?

35:01.031 --> 35:04.004
- I need you to do me a favor.
- What's that?

35:04.078 --> 35:07.593
- I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.
- Me?

35:07.708 --> 35:09.648
- Yes.
- Why?

35:09.711 --> 35:11.682
Well, maybe one of them
won't come in.

35:11.745 --> 35:15.480
Or maybe they would all come in, but then
you would be able to spot something wrong.

35:15.552 --> 35:19.579
- I can't handle it right now.
- I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up.

35:19.663 --> 35:22.792
Don't you want to help me
find the killer? Have a heart.

35:22.865 --> 35:25.661
- What does that mean?
- If you don't tell 'em, I'll have to tell 'em.

35:25.733 --> 35:27.664
Am I the person to break
the news to these people?

35:27.738 --> 35:30.397
"Listen up, you fuckin' daffodils.
Your shrink is dead.

35:30.480 --> 35:35.071
Which means that all the time, effort and
love you put in this relationship is wasted.

35:35.154 --> 35:38.712
You're gonna remain as fucked up
as you are, or get worse."

35:38.794 --> 35:41.778
You are one sinister
piece of work.

35:50.207 --> 35:53.442
All right.
I'll do it.

35:53.504 --> 35:56.143
It's better if you do it.

35:56.206 --> 35:58.343
No, you listen to me.
You don't understand, Gene.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.608
Don't lie. Just give
the family what it wants.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.986
No. No, you don't understand.

36:03.049 --> 36:05.930
- What...?

36:05.992 --> 36:07.921
I have to call ya back.

36:10.570 --> 36:12.511
Christ.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.839
Hey, you all right?

36:15.943 --> 36:18.145
Hey.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.484
Why me?

36:22.577 --> 36:25.718
Hi. I'm Rose.

36:25.790 --> 36:29.880
Hi, Rose. Nice of you
to run into me like this.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.893
I'm Bill Capa.

36:31.967 --> 36:34.397
I got no insurance.

36:36.306 --> 36:39.332
I know it's against the law
and everything.

36:41.513 --> 36:43.712
Don't bust my chops.

36:43.786 --> 36:47.114
I'll bring the money to you, if you
could just get an estimate, okay?

36:47.228 --> 36:50.598
- Why don't you give me a break, huh?
- Got a pen?

36:50.661 --> 36:52.600
Yeah.

37:01.311 --> 37:03.168
- Here.
- Thanks.

37:07.987 --> 37:13.589
Oh. Poor old brain
can't remember its own phone number?

37:13.653 --> 37:16.354
I just moved here.

37:16.428 --> 37:19.484
- Oh.
- From New York.

37:19.599 --> 37:23.510
I wrote my address down
'cause I'm not sure about this number.

37:23.573 --> 37:25.127
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be there...

37:25.242 --> 37:28.581
so maybe you can call me sometime
over the next couple of days.

37:28.653 --> 37:32.210
- I will.
- Bye.

37:32.283 --> 37:35.059
Hey, uh, don't you
want my address?

37:36.957 --> 37:38.960
You could lie.

37:57.122 --> 37:59.116
Hi.

37:59.230 --> 38:02.786
- Who hasn't arrived yet?
- Sondra.

38:02.870 --> 38:05.530
- Where's Bob?
- W-What's wrong?

38:05.605 --> 38:08.702
If it's all right,
I'd rather wait till we're all here.

38:10.612 --> 38:14.920
- She always this late?
- Depends on who is banging her.

38:14.982 --> 38:17.246
I'm sorry.

38:17.330 --> 38:19.884
Class was really,
really, really late.

38:19.958 --> 38:22.785
What class is that? Advanced
cunnilingus for the single woman...

38:22.858 --> 38:25.226
or C.P.R. For
pleasure and gain?

38:25.298 --> 38:28.887
- Oh, Christ. Don't excite her.
- Where's Dr. Moore?

38:29.003 --> 38:31.944
- There's something that I want to tell you.
- What?

38:32.018 --> 38:34.771
Well, what's the matter?

38:34.844 --> 38:37.149
- Yeah?
- Well, I...

38:37.213 --> 38:39.821
I'm tryin' to pay attention. Shh!

38:39.884 --> 38:41.917
You should prepare yourselves
for bad news.

38:41.989 --> 38:44.755
Why? Uh-oh.

38:44.827 --> 38:46.759
Bob's been killed.

38:46.830 --> 38:49.365
- What are you saying?

38:49.429 --> 38:52.308
- What are you telling me?
- He was murdered.

38:52.371 --> 38:54.968
- He was locking up here
late Friday night.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.012
- Here?
- Yes, right here in the office.

38:57.075 --> 39:01.143
Was he shot, stabbed, beaten?
Have they got a suspect? A motive?

39:01.258 --> 39:03.084
Three days go by
and you don't call us?

39:03.187 --> 39:06.087
- I thought it'd be easier if you heard it together.
- Oh, I see.

39:06.161 --> 39:08.092
So even Bob's death
is group therapy. That's great.

39:08.164 --> 39:11.002
Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us
a chance to grieve together. Shit!

39:11.076 --> 39:14.006
- What the fuck is going on? I need to know more!
- He was stabbed to death.

39:14.069 --> 39:17.740
- How many times was he stabbed?
- This man was Bob's best friend!

39:17.814 --> 39:20.745
- Do you really need exact numbers now?
- Sondra!

39:20.818 --> 39:24.115
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- It's okay. It's okay.

39:26.263 --> 39:30.165
- It doesn't make sense to me!
- Many times, Clark.

39:30.228 --> 39:32.700
More than 30.
That's all I can tell you.

39:32.763 --> 39:34.500
It wasn't a thief.
I'll tell you that right now.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.176
- I agree.
- Why stab a guy 30 times?

39:38.249 --> 39:42.079
Bob... He'd piss in his pants if
you showed him a knife. You know that.

39:42.152 --> 39:44.165
- What are you saying?
- I am saying, Sondra...

39:44.248 --> 39:47.983
that you really have to hate a person
to stab him that many times!

39:48.056 --> 39:51.508
You're a shrink, right? You know what
kind of power people hand over to shrinks.

39:51.593 --> 39:54.428
Well, maybe sometimes they hand over
more than they want to.

39:54.502 --> 39:57.068
That is absolutely correct.

39:57.131 --> 40:01.940
A thief would not stick around
to stab someone 30 times.

40:02.004 --> 40:05.007
Since when did you become
such an expert on robbery?

40:05.081 --> 40:08.075
It's not the robbery
he's an expert on. It's the rage.

40:08.189 --> 40:11.590
W- What are we gonna do now?
I- I mean us.

40:11.662 --> 40:16.723
- Th-The group.
- I bet Dr. Capa has an idea.

40:16.796 --> 40:19.529
What does he mean?

40:22.711 --> 40:26.007
I think Casey
is suggesting that I...

40:26.081 --> 40:28.166
may have some plan
to replace Bob.

40:30.181 --> 40:35.448
- Maybe you should.
- No, I can't do that. Not right now.

40:35.522 --> 40:38.150
- Why? Why not?
- For one reason or another...

40:38.233 --> 40:40.633
I'm more screwed up
than you people are.

40:40.737 --> 40:43.001
I was just being
obnoxious and loud before.

40:43.105 --> 40:46.736
- Anybody have a fuckin' Xanax?
- I have a Librium.

40:46.839 --> 40:50.084
- Stop with the drugs.
- It would be a good idea if you stayed.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.338
- Body isn't cold yet.
- There'd be some connection.

40:52.421 --> 40:55.873
You were Bob's best friend.

40:55.958 --> 40:58.680
You... You seem
kind of like him.

40:58.763 --> 41:01.528
It'd be so much easier
to trust you.

41:01.590 --> 41:05.867
I know what kind of a force
group can become in your lives.

41:05.940 --> 41:08.496
You... tell things here.

41:08.580 --> 41:12.032
Intimate things that you wouldn't
tell your best friend.

41:13.482 --> 41:15.538
I'm very flattered
that you would, uh...

41:19.858 --> 41:24.353
But the truth is, you are
the people that make this work.

41:24.436 --> 41:29.194
I will be more than happy to try and find
someone for you to continue this, but I cannot...

41:29.267 --> 41:32.803
Does my opinion
count for anything?

41:32.876 --> 41:34.899
I would like to ask...

41:34.983 --> 41:38.312
why it is you feel
so inadequate for the task.

41:39.824 --> 41:41.754
Maybe he just
don't like us.

41:41.827 --> 41:43.954
- No, that's not it, Buck. - Shh!

41:44.027 --> 41:46.322
Why don't you step on something?

41:52.008 --> 41:55.169
Six weeks ago, I spoke
harshly to a patient...

41:55.242 --> 41:57.140
and she committed suicide.

41:59.779 --> 42:01.709
Right in front of me.

42:05.892 --> 42:10.525
Perhaps she would have done this anyway.
That's what my colleagues say.

42:10.597 --> 42:12.589
But I don't know.

42:12.673 --> 42:15.302
Oh, I'm so sorry.

42:17.576 --> 42:20.769
And my patient...

42:20.852 --> 42:22.814
her name was Michelle...

42:26.955 --> 42:29.731
jumped out of a wi...
window in my office.

42:30.867 --> 42:34.319
- Oh.
- So much blood.

42:35.438 --> 42:38.129
So red, and I...

42:38.212 --> 42:41.269
And right, uh,
before my eyes...

42:41.341 --> 42:45.013
the red, uh,
disappeared.

42:45.086 --> 42:49.885
Just turned to gray, and so
I don't see... red now.

42:51.355 --> 42:54.204
But, see, I was her doctor.

42:54.266 --> 42:57.865
And I failed.
So I can't help you.

42:59.867 --> 43:03.028
I don't think that you want someone
like me around right now.

43:03.112 --> 43:05.304
I think I do.

43:05.385 --> 43:07.546
Me too.

43:07.619 --> 43:10.384
Why don't you give us
a try for a month?

43:10.456 --> 43:13.785
Listen, if you need any...

43:13.857 --> 43:16.924
any free legal advice...

43:16.997 --> 43:19.303
you know, to help
wrap up Bob's affairs...

43:19.376 --> 43:21.306
please don't hesitate
to call me.

43:21.368 --> 43:25.572
I'm not with anyone right now, and I would
be more than happy to help you in any way.

43:29.787 --> 43:31.718
Thank you.

43:48.043 --> 43:50.672
- You bring me a confession?
- Nope.

43:50.744 --> 43:53.143
Well, you win some,
you lose some, huh, Capa?

43:53.216 --> 43:56.951
Listen, maybe it wasn't
one of the group.

43:57.015 --> 43:59.987
Oh, no! He's beginning
to like 'em already!

44:00.061 --> 44:04.797
Your friend Bob Moore deserves
a lot more loyalty than this.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.999
Hey, what is... What are we sitting here
shouting at each other for?

44:08.103 --> 44:10.002
- What is with this place?

44:10.074 --> 44:14.018
I used to work in Narcotics,
and I used to come here a lot.

44:14.081 --> 44:17.283
I probably fucked
and/or arrested...

44:17.347 --> 44:19.318
half of these people's
parents.

44:19.392 --> 44:22.365
- It's a nice place. I like it.
- Makes sense.

44:23.688 --> 44:27.297
Look, I'm sorry
I don't have anything for ya.

44:28.529 --> 44:30.479
I'll see ya around.

44:36.082 --> 44:38.607
- So that's it, huh?
- Yep.

44:38.721 --> 44:40.985
Anything you
wanna tell me?

44:42.424 --> 44:45.219
- No.
- Yeah, it's a four-door, man.

44:45.293 --> 44:48.266
- Well, you better shut the group down.
- Who said I hadn't?

44:48.329 --> 44:50.270
Well, have you
or haven't you?

44:54.671 --> 44:57.770
They asked me to take over the group,
and I couldn't say no.

44:57.843 --> 45:00.753
I figured.

45:00.817 --> 45:03.341
You're gonna do real well
in this town.

45:03.424 --> 45:07.023
- Shut the fucker down.
- What's the problem? You sent me over there.

45:07.097 --> 45:09.756
No, I sent you there
to convey a piece of bad news.

45:09.861 --> 45:12.990
- Oh, give me a break, would ya, man?
- I didn't send you there...

45:13.105 --> 45:15.035
to go trolling for business.

45:15.107 --> 45:17.403
- Aw, come on.
- You told me you couldn't handle it.

45:17.475 --> 45:20.042
Well, it turns out
that I can handle it.

45:20.104 --> 45:23.953
You stick your dick in a barrel of
barracudas once, maybe you won't lose it.

45:24.015 --> 45:27.897
You leave it in there,
it's gonna get chewed off at the root.

45:27.960 --> 45:31.798
Appreciate your concern
for my dick, Hector. Thank you.

45:31.862 --> 45:35.096
I'm bein' really nice
out of concern for your safety.

45:35.169 --> 45:39.071
In case it's one of them, huh?
Shut it down, okay?

45:39.142 --> 45:43.911
- No, can't do that.
- Shut it down, chingada!

45:44.015 --> 45:48.009
Don't be an asshole! Find another
fucking set of wombats to exploit!

45:49.418 --> 45:51.755
These sudden irrational
outbursts, Hector...

45:51.829 --> 45:53.956
did they begin in childhood
or in puberty?

45:54.029 --> 45:56.970
- Get outta my face!
- Am I in your face?

45:57.034 --> 45:59.965
An interesting choice of words.
Would you like me in your face?

46:00.039 --> 46:01.967
You married, Hector?

46:02.040 --> 46:05.641
If you ever want to deal with any of these
problems, I'll give you a special rate.

46:05.713 --> 46:09.385
Special rate?
What, like frequent flyer miles?

46:13.026 --> 46:15.791
Let me ask you something.
Are you really color-blind...

46:15.895 --> 46:18.868
or is that some shit you feed them
so they feel sorry for you?

46:18.962 --> 46:20.954
No, unfortunately,
I am color...

46:25.137 --> 46:29.602
- You bugged the office.
- You know, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.297
Whoa!

48:39.939 --> 48:41.879
Hello.

48:43.079 --> 48:46.303
- Who's there? - Hi.

48:46.386 --> 48:50.454
Remember me?
Miss Fender Bender?

48:50.516 --> 48:52.895
There she is...

48:52.959 --> 48:57.454
a little angel dancing
on the head of a pin.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.838
So, did you get
that estimate?

49:07.521 --> 49:09.451
No.

49:11.015 --> 49:12.955
Wow.

49:15.459 --> 49:17.389
Nice place you got here.

49:18.600 --> 49:20.530
It's a little cold...

49:19.500 --> 49:23.067
but it's kind of
tasteful, right?

49:23.129 --> 49:26.728
Yeah. And wet.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.770
You too, I guess.

49:28.845 --> 49:31.138
Cold or tasteful?

49:32.380 --> 49:36.686
So, are we eating in
or are you taking me out?

49:43.330 --> 49:45.270
You can't? At all?

49:46.594 --> 49:50.036
Wow. Not even
shades of pink?

49:51.401 --> 49:54.092
Can't tell me if
it's smeared or not.

49:54.176 --> 49:56.272
I can't tell you if
your eyes are bloodshot.

49:56.335 --> 49:58.900
Really?
That's sad.

50:00.203 --> 50:03.510
So you know what?
In respect for your infirmity...

50:03.582 --> 50:06.680
I'm gonna give up
wearing lipstick.

50:08.923 --> 50:13.188
There's something about me that
I bet you find a little strange, right?

50:15.158 --> 50:17.766
- What is that?
- Well, I haven't asked what you do.

50:17.828 --> 50:21.729
That's right.
You showed remarkable restraint.

50:21.802 --> 50:24.294
Well, it's because
I'd rather guess.

50:24.368 --> 50:28.601
You know, I actually get upset if
someone tries to tell me before I can...

50:28.684 --> 50:30.615
figure it out
for myself, you know?

50:32.084 --> 50:34.557
But what if I'm ashamed
of what I do?

50:34.630 --> 50:38.530
Why? I mean, why would you
be ashamed of being a shrink?

50:40.667 --> 50:42.660
Who told you
I was a shrink?

50:42.722 --> 50:45.162
Well, are you?

50:48.469 --> 50:51.837
How did you know?

50:51.909 --> 50:54.997
- It's the way you look at me, you know?
- How do I look at you?

50:55.081 --> 50:57.875
You have this kindness
in your eyes.

50:57.949 --> 51:02.004
- But I think that you're
using it to keep me away.

51:02.089 --> 51:05.206
You know, you're trying
to play it safe, trying to see me...

51:05.290 --> 51:08.658
as a case instead of
as a female.

51:08.732 --> 51:12.319
So you have
a tuning fork too.

51:12.402 --> 51:15.166
I guess we have
a lot in common.

51:15.270 --> 51:17.231
We seem to be playin'
the same game.

51:19.368 --> 51:21.340
Why do you say
I'm playing a game?

51:21.413 --> 51:24.438
Because you're
the fantasy girl, aren't you?

51:24.511 --> 51:29.882
Quicksilver? The face glimpsed
across a crowded room?

51:29.955 --> 51:33.249
Yeah, that's...
That's exactly what I am.

51:33.322 --> 51:35.419
You'll be whatever
they want you to be...

51:35.492 --> 51:38.944
no substance,
no rules.

51:39.026 --> 51:40.966
Light as air.

51:43.063 --> 51:47.663
So your feet never have to touch those burning
hot coals the rest of us walk around on.

51:50.552 --> 51:54.378
Yeah.
Sort of like...

51:54.451 --> 51:56.350
not seeing red?

52:00.855 --> 52:02.764
Yeah, sort of like that.

52:02.815 --> 52:06.164
I was afraid during dinner
that you had taken a room here...

52:06.225 --> 52:09.636
and I might have to decide
whether or not to go up with you.

52:09.698 --> 52:14.068
Yes, but that was part of my plan.
I mean, I wanted to. Thank you.

52:14.141 --> 52:16.070
Oh, I need a taxi.
Taxi!

52:16.143 --> 52:18.114
No, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.

52:18.176 --> 52:21.076
What are you being
so tough for?

52:22.411 --> 52:24.340
I'm just beginning to think
that maybe I'll...

52:54.990 --> 52:59.120
Cab's here!
Yo, who called a taxi?

52:59.225 --> 53:03.459
I am thinking you should just let me take
you home and forget about this stupid taxi.

53:03.532 --> 53:07.829
Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay
exactly where you are, 'cause...

53:07.901 --> 53:11.197
in that condition, you'd get arrested.

53:11.270 --> 53:13.199
Start another riot.

53:13.272 --> 53:15.639
Give me your phone number
and address.

53:15.714 --> 53:18.507
Why? You want to make me
fall to earth and burn my feet?

53:18.581 --> 53:21.844
Whatever happened to quicksilver
and light as air?

53:21.917 --> 53:24.618
She floats away
on her sweet young legs.

53:24.682 --> 53:27.059
Waves to him once.

53:27.121 --> 53:29.812
Drives away without
a backward glance.

53:33.130 --> 53:35.599
- Richie is what he is.
- What exactly is that?

53:35.694 --> 53:40.638
He was born back of a van going up
Route 5 to a Grateful Dead concert.

53:40.710 --> 53:44.414
The first sound he ever heard
was "Beat It On Down The Line."

53:46.812 --> 53:49.837
- Well, it could be worse.
- Not much.

53:51.849 --> 53:55.310
- How long have you been his guardian?
- Since he was nine or ten.

53:55.394 --> 53:57.689
But I've always
taken care of Richie.

53:57.762 --> 54:00.159
So, what can I do for you?

54:00.265 --> 54:03.027
Um, I was hoping
you would help me...

54:03.133 --> 54:05.500
get Richie out of therapy.

54:05.573 --> 54:09.536
Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've
been like a mother and a father to him...

54:09.640 --> 54:12.330
and I know I can get
overprotective, but...

54:12.414 --> 54:17.347
- Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now?
- What Richie needs is normalcy.

54:17.409 --> 54:20.518
Well, normalcy...

54:20.580 --> 54:23.250
Normalcy can be interpreted
in a lot of different ways.

54:23.323 --> 54:27.755
Richie has practically been raised by the
state; the social workers, psychiatrists...

54:27.828 --> 54:32.500
forcing him into this,
um, psycho-servitude.

54:32.563 --> 54:35.796
He is the sweetest kid you'll ever meet,
but he thinks of himself as handicapped.

54:35.910 --> 54:37.839
It just isn't right.

54:37.911 --> 54:40.468
Well, he's got
legal problems.

54:40.582 --> 54:43.513
Richie was sentenced by the court
to mandatory treatment.

54:43.607 --> 54:48.237
Every kid gets into trouble. I mean,
that's why I need you to help get him out.

54:48.320 --> 54:52.617
You know, Dale, it's hard to tell
when someone's feeling pain...

54:52.690 --> 54:56.987
- but I want you to know...
- If Richie feels pain...

54:57.061 --> 54:59.833
then I feel pain.

54:59.897 --> 55:02.233
Pretty much
in tune with him.

55:02.305 --> 55:04.860
I just wish
you'd give us a chance.

55:06.738 --> 55:09.408
Let me check out
Richie's status.

55:09.512 --> 55:14.643
Then, uh, I'll give
probation a call.

55:15.957 --> 55:18.815
Oh, thanks.
Thanks, Dr. Capa.

55:18.887 --> 55:22.058
- I really appreciate it.
- You're welcome, Dale.

55:22.120 --> 55:25.031
You either lift weights
or work with your hands.

55:25.092 --> 55:27.793
Yeah, uh,
I make furniture.

55:27.867 --> 55:31.100
- Really.
- Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.

55:31.162 --> 55:34.510
- No kidding.
- We called it the Chrysler desk.

55:34.583 --> 55:37.440
- Chrysler.
- You ever see his bed?

55:46.795 --> 55:49.047
Hi. This is Casey.

55:49.121 --> 55:52.656
I can't get to the phone right now,
so, uh, leave a message. Thanks.

55:57.600 --> 55:59.997
Casey, this is Bill Capa.

56:00.070 --> 56:03.001
It's around noon.

56:03.074 --> 56:07.673
Your father sent me a check for the
private sessions you were having with Bob.

56:07.746 --> 56:11.543
Should I send the check back
or do you want to continue?

56:13.086 --> 56:15.453
Let me know, okay?

56:15.558 --> 56:18.187
I think I want to continue.

56:18.300 --> 56:20.281
- You bitch!

56:20.500 --> 56:22.649
- I called you a bitch!

56:22.690 --> 56:25.695
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:27.834 --> 56:29.693
- Oh!

56:31.523 --> 56:33.572
- Oh! I'm sorry.

57:04.772 --> 57:06.732
- Hey!
- You idiot!

57:11.886 --> 57:15.062
- Hey! Hey!

57:15.133 --> 57:18.016
Help!
Shit!

57:22.366 --> 57:24.548
Fuck!

57:29.631 --> 57:32.817
- Hello!

57:35.127 --> 57:38.754
I am not goin' back to New York,
you hear me? You're stuck with me!

57:44.584 --> 57:47.627
Fuckin' bill.
Great.

57:48.663 --> 57:50.522
- Capa!

57:50.623 --> 57:53.094
Oh, that's perfect!
That's really perfect!

57:53.195 --> 57:54.993
Just like a cop!
You're never there when you need one!

57:55.064 --> 57:57.174
What did I do now?

57:57.254 --> 57:59.948
Somebody put a rattlesnake
in the mailbox, Hector!

58:00.017 --> 58:03.706
A rattlesnake.

58:03.776 --> 58:08.689
- You scared the shit out of me outside.
- Oh, I scared you, huh?

58:08.760 --> 58:10.629
What the hell
are you doing here?

58:10.699 --> 58:13.673
I could use some assistance,
some of your professional wisdom.

58:13.752 --> 58:17.441
- I'm really flattered.
- Everyone in the group has an alibi.

58:17.510 --> 58:19.430
Except for Casey.

58:19.502 --> 58:22.325
He says he was alone
in his loft.

58:22.425 --> 58:24.293
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

58:24.364 --> 58:27.790
- What does that mean?
- What do you make of Casey?

58:27.901 --> 58:30.875
- He's a good kid.
- You're an asshole, Capa.

58:30.956 --> 58:33.901
- Should we analyze that statement, Hector?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:33.970 --> 58:36.161
- Come on. Who is our man? Help me.
- You're the cop.

58:36.221 --> 58:38.140
- Figure it out.
- You know what I think?

58:38.221 --> 58:40.160
I think it was you.
You've got the look.

58:40.239 --> 58:43.697
- That's right.
- Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both.

58:43.777 --> 58:48.148
Everyone says there was a weird
competitive thing going between you.

58:48.209 --> 58:50.681
Yeah, that's right.
There was.

58:50.751 --> 58:53.132
I admit it.
He was on the way up...

58:53.203 --> 58:55.313
- and I was on the way down.
- Including...

58:55.423 --> 58:57.574
Splat! It unhinged you.

58:57.665 --> 59:01.844
- I bet you've seen every
episode of Columbo, huh?

59:01.915 --> 59:04.065
- Who is it?

59:04.135 --> 59:08.567
Hi. It's me, Rose.
The old fender bender.

59:08.637 --> 59:12.223
- That's a very young girl
to be going around...

59:12.305 --> 59:14.314
fending benders.

59:25.035 --> 59:27.759
Here she comes.

59:27.870 --> 59:30.943
Weightless,
hanging from the sky...

59:31.044 --> 59:36.501
wearing a short dress
of indeterminate color.

59:36.582 --> 59:38.762
It's red,
poor thing.

59:38.821 --> 59:40.691
Thank you.

59:44.107 --> 59:47.563
I was thinking.
Maybe I should see a shrink.

59:47.644 --> 59:50.437
I can recommend someone.

59:50.508 --> 59:53.331
I feel better already.

59:56.125 --> 01:00:00.104
- God, I missed you.
- This time you won't miss.

01:02:26.607 --> 01:02:31.229
- I want you to get dressed up. Get dressed up.
- All right.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.284
I want to get dressed up.

56:20.500 --> 56:22.727
- I called you a bitch!

56:22.770 --> 56:25.885
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

56:28.102 --> 56:30.029
- Oh!

56:31.926 --> 56:34.049
- Oh! I'm sorry.

57:06.389 --> 57:08.420
- Hey!
- You idiot!

57:13.763 --> 57:17.055
- Hey! Hey!

57:17.128 --> 57:20.117
Help!
Shit!

57:24.625 --> 57:26.887
Fuck!

57:32.156 --> 57:35.458
- Hello!

57:37.853 --> 57:41.612
I am not goin' back to New York,
you hear me? You're stuck with me!

57:47.655 --> 57:50.809
Fuckin' bill.
Great.

57:51.883 --> 57:53.810
- Capa!

57:53.914 --> 57:56.476
Oh, that's perfect!
That's really perfect!

57:56.580 --> 57:58.444
Just like a cop!
You're never there when you need one!

57:58.518 --> 58:00.705
What did I do now?

58:00.788 --> 58:03.580
Somebody put a rattlesnake

58:03.652 --> 58:07.475
A rattlesnake.

58:07.548 --> 58:12.640
- You scared the shit out of me outside.
- Oh, I scared you, huh?

58:12.714 --> 58:14.651
What the hell
are you doing here?

58:14.724 --> 58:17.806
I could use some assistance,
some of your professional wisdom.

58:17.888 --> 58:21.712

59:14.778 --> 59:18.495
- That's a very young girl
to be going around...

59:18.580 --> 59:20.662
fending benders.

59:31.775 --> 59:34.598
Here she comes.

59:34.713 --> 59:37.898
Weightless,
hanging from the sky...

59:38.003 --> 59:43.659
wearing a short dress
of indeterminate color.

59:43.743 --> 59:46.003
It's red,
poor thing.

59:46.064 --> 59:48.002
Thank you.

59:51.543 --> 59:55.125
I was thinking.
Maybe I should see a shrink.

59:55.209 --> 59:58.104
I can recommend someone.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:01.104
I feel better already.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.124
- God, I missed you.
- This time you won't miss.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.220
- I want you to get dressed up. Get dressed up.
- All right.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:34.670
I want to get dressed up.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.580
- Right now?
- Uh-huh.

01:02:43.835 --> 01:02:45.937
You're not eating.

01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:48.280
Don't you like my food?

01:02:50.632 --> 01:02:53.131
I'd like your food
five inches to the left.

01:02:55.023 --> 01:02:57.042
Okay.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.689
But if you don't
like this...

01:03:05.763 --> 01:03:08.669
I have something else for you.

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:10.792
Yeah, okay.

01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:15.016
I think it's ready.

01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:22.577
It's a miracle.
I found it.

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:24.931
Here he is.
Richie Dexter.

01:04:24.993 --> 01:04:27.931
Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
That's his brother.

01:04:28.004 --> 01:04:32.279
Kids were put under care,
let's see, about six years ago.

01:04:32.355 --> 01:04:35.951
- Does it say why?
- Abandonment, abuse.

01:04:36.066 --> 01:04:40.845
The children
were assigned to a, uh...

01:04:40.917 --> 01:04:43.898
Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena.

01:04:44.003 --> 01:04:46.260
A child psychiatrist.

01:04:46.345 --> 01:04:51.123
Richie was 12.
No foster parents.

01:04:51.186 --> 01:04:53.801
Looks like the doctor retired
a couple years after that.

01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:56.142
Then we lost track
of the kids until recently.

01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:58.150
What do you mean,
"lost track" of them?

01:04:58.225 --> 01:05:00.670
Like on a radar:
One minute a blip, the next, no blip.

01:05:00.723 --> 01:05:04.174
Hey, look. This is the lost souls
memorial wing.

01:05:04.246 --> 01:05:06.338
Children of L.A. County
in the '90s:

01:05:06.421 --> 01:05:10.092
250,000 cases in here,
and there's two more down the hall.

01:05:13.312 --> 01:05:15.875
Nobody's like
your ex-husband!

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:18.060
- That's for sure.
- That's for sure.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.475
Okay, okay, okay.
Here it is.

01:05:20.538 --> 01:05:23.569
- Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful.
- Isn't it great?

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:27.261
I know. It's incredible.
Look at all these bags.

01:05:27.335 --> 01:05:30.805
Oh, and that man that was
staring at you in the shop...

01:05:30.881 --> 01:05:33.619
- was so funny.

01:05:33.692 --> 01:05:36.328
I think I should have got it
in green or something.

01:05:36.401 --> 01:05:39.077
- Oh.
- Oh! Lush!

01:05:39.141 --> 01:05:41.587
What do you think?

01:05:41.681 --> 01:05:44.128
I think...
you look beautiful.

01:05:44.202 --> 01:05:46.763
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:46.878 --> 01:05:49.785
- Come zip me up.
- Okay.

01:05:49.858 --> 01:05:53.560
Okay.
Oh, this is so tight.

01:05:53.633 --> 01:05:56.237
Thank you.

01:05:57.575 --> 01:05:59.750
I need to find
a new husband.

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:05.042
- I need some more money.
- Oh, men. Who needs them?

01:06:05.103 --> 01:06:08.753
- Have you seen my earrings anywhere? Oh, sweet!
- Yes, I've got them.

01:06:08.827 --> 01:06:11.399
Oh, my God.

01:06:11.461 --> 01:06:13.437
- I love these. Aren't they pretty?
- They're so gorgeous, yes.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:16.972
- Try yours on.
- Okay.

01:06:30.441 --> 01:06:32.877
What now?

01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:36.191
- Sondra, what?
- I feel embarrassed.

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:38.199
Why?

01:06:38.273 --> 01:06:40.364
'Cause...

01:06:40.447 --> 01:06:42.570
the way
you're looking at me.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:45.927
- Sondra.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.743
- Do men look at you like that?
- No.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.450
Yes.

01:06:52.565 --> 01:06:54.615
But it's different.

01:06:54.730 --> 01:06:58.621
You know, Sondra...

01:06:58.695 --> 01:07:03.128
it doesn't have to be
any different at all.

01:07:06.354 --> 01:07:10.653
- You better get that.
- Hello.

01:07:10.715 --> 01:07:15.107
- Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.134
Um, mmm, okay.

01:07:19.218 --> 01:07:23.767
N... My trainer's coming
at 2:30, but that's...

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.836
Yeah. You are? Okay!

01:07:26.941 --> 01:07:30.761
Um, oh, there you are!

01:07:30.832 --> 01:07:33.257
Okay, okay.
I'll see you in a minute!

01:07:33.331 --> 01:07:35.589
Bye.

01:07:35.661 --> 01:07:38.087
- Who's that?
- That's my analyst!

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.096
- He's coming to visit me.
- He what?

01:07:40.158 --> 01:07:42.094
- Oh, my God. He's coming over.
- Sondra, thanks.

01:07:42.156 --> 01:07:44.581
- Oh, thanks a lot! Nothing!
- What's the matter? What?

01:07:44.653 --> 01:07:47.578
If you don't know, I thought we were just
going to have a nice afternoon together...

01:07:47.651 --> 01:07:50.408
- maybe have dinner.
- Well, we can. Oh, don't worry.

01:07:50.482 --> 01:07:53.240
Don't be upset.
You can stay here.

01:07:53.313 --> 01:07:55.749
- Really.
- You just don't understand, do you?

01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:58.807
- I don't.
- Nobody appreciates you the way that I do.

01:07:58.912 --> 01:08:02.273
- People just use you, and you don't even see it.
- Oh, don't be upset.

01:08:04.969 --> 01:08:08.726
That's more like it.
Ciao.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.733
Oh, my God.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.904
- Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.
- Hi.

01:08:30.978 --> 01:08:33.402
- I didn't just walk in on my own.
- Oh... no.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:36.368
- That was my, um...

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:39.198
- That was my girlfriend, Bonnie. Yeah.
- Bonnie. Yes.

01:08:39.272 --> 01:08:42.799
- Please, come in.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

01:08:42.862 --> 01:08:46.296
- This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
- You think so? Thank you.

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:48.920
A lot of nice, nice things.
A lot of nice art.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:53.291
What did you come here for?

01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:57.120
Well, I feel like
I have so much...

01:08:57.193 --> 01:08:59.243
so much catching up
to do with all of you.

01:08:59.327 --> 01:09:02.772
And I know that you're
very close with Richie.

01:09:02.886 --> 01:09:05.612
And I was wondering if you could
tell me anything that might help me...

01:09:05.718 --> 01:09:10.639
- understand him a little better.
- Richie's... my little baby.

01:09:10.743 --> 01:09:12.774
His brother Dale thinks
that your "little baby"...

01:09:12.836 --> 01:09:15.531
- should be taken out of therapy.
- That's insane!

01:09:15.604 --> 01:09:18.258
I think it's a mistake too.

01:09:18.341 --> 01:09:21.162
That Dale is
a dangerous bastard.

01:09:21.234 --> 01:09:24.523
But he obviously seems
to care for Richie a great deal.

01:09:24.596 --> 01:09:27.791
There's a big gap in Richie's life
up until about a year ago.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:31.185
Did he ever mention
a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you?

01:09:31.256 --> 01:09:33.693
I don't have much to tell.

01:09:33.765 --> 01:09:38.053
Richie's okay.
He's sweet.

01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:43.517
Did you know that he was...
molested as a child?

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:47.877
No, I didn't know that.

01:09:47.939 --> 01:09:51.666
- It's sticking out all over.
- It's fashionable.

01:09:51.738 --> 01:09:54.361
I mean, it pays well.

01:09:54.445 --> 01:09:58.369
At least, you know,
you can write a book, go on Oprah.

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:00.398
That was quite a show
he gave us in group.

01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:04.894
- You think Richie has a violent streak?

01:10:04.966 --> 01:10:07.891
Oh.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:11.076
Let's cut to the chase.

01:10:11.190 --> 01:10:14.083
Richie did not kill
Bob Moore.

01:10:14.157 --> 01:10:17.352
You know...
it's really swell.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:20.547
Snooping around here...

01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:25.198
sniffing for blood
on other people's hands...

01:10:25.282 --> 01:10:27.738
while pretending
to help your patients?

01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:32.785
- You really think that I don't care about Richie?
- Richie wouldn't hurt a fly!

01:10:32.869 --> 01:10:35.137
Why don't you take a look
at someone dangerous.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.364
Why don't you take a look
at someone who could do it!

01:10:38.426 --> 01:10:42.495
- Why don't you take a look at Clark!
- Clark?

01:10:42.599 --> 01:10:45.285
Clark! Clark!

01:10:45.398 --> 01:10:50.114
Clark is a sneaky, lying,
button-down son of a bitch...

01:10:50.187 --> 01:10:52.653
who pretends to be
this gentle creature!

01:10:52.747 --> 01:10:56.046
I heard him screaming
one night at Bob.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:00.168
It made the hairs on my neck stand up!

01:11:00.251 --> 01:11:03.612
Anyway...

01:11:03.686 --> 01:11:07.432
I hope that they fry...

01:11:07.505 --> 01:11:10.471
whoever did it,
and it takes a really long time.

01:11:10.543 --> 01:11:14.093
And then...

01:11:14.176 --> 01:11:17.132
And then a fuse blows.

01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:19.754
They have to start
all over again.

01:11:23.823 --> 01:11:25.760
Wow!
That's my trainer.

01:11:25.831 --> 01:11:28.653
I gotta go.

01:11:28.725 --> 01:11:31.515
I gotta get the door.

01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:37.905
- This is my trainer, Chris.
- Hi.

01:11:39.143 --> 01:11:41.339
Bye-bye.

01:11:41.412 --> 01:11:45.346
I don't feel like lifting weights today.

01:11:45.408 --> 01:11:48.135
- Okay.
- Let's do something else.

01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:42.816
Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's
shop here?

01:13:13.768 --> 01:13:16.234
Excuse me.

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:22.677
- Hello.
- Did you go to the house?

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:25.777
Yeah.
Nobody was home.

01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:27.776
- I would have phoned a...

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:33.240
I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I
don't have your phone number in our file.

01:13:33.313 --> 01:13:35.249
No problem.

01:13:35.321 --> 01:13:38.370
So, uh, did you
make up your mind?

01:13:38.444 --> 01:13:43.960
After Dr. Niedelmeyer,
did Richie get another psychiatrist?

01:13:44.043 --> 01:13:47.291
No.
No, we moved.

01:13:49.528 --> 01:13:52.650
Richie went to school.

01:13:52.733 --> 01:13:57.125
- Everything was fine.
- Well... that's the problem, Dale.

01:13:57.198 --> 01:14:00.205
I look at Richie, and I don't
see that everything is fine.

01:14:00.289 --> 01:14:03.442
I see a kid that's
on the brink.

01:14:03.557 --> 01:14:07.814
A person, uh,
gets a bullet in the head.

01:14:07.886 --> 01:14:10.280
Sometimes they just
leave it there 'cause...

01:14:10.353 --> 01:14:13.776
to fuck around in the brain
is gonna paralyze the person.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:17.139
- That's Richie.
- What's the bullet?

01:14:17.211 --> 01:14:21.302
Whatever it was,
I got him away.

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:25.089
- You want to talk about that?
- No.

01:14:27.671 --> 01:14:31.917
I want you to stop trying to tear
off the scabs. Let the demons rest.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.988
You dig around in Richie's head,
he's gonna blow up in your face.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.416
- You think he's violent?
- Not with me.

01:14:39.493 --> 01:14:41.857
I think you're making
a mistake, Dale.

01:14:41.933 --> 01:14:44.204
This is not the time to
take Richie out of therapy.

01:14:44.278 --> 01:14:48.279
- If you don't like me, let's get him someone else.
- Jesus Christ.

01:14:48.353 --> 01:14:50.316
One of you
is the same as another.

01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:14.648
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer?
- Yes.

01:15:14.724 --> 01:15:16.858
Hi, I'm Bill Capa.
I'm a doctor.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:22.226
- I tracked you down through the Psychiatric Institute.
- How very enterprising of you.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:31.809
Actually, I was wondering
if I could speak to Dr. Niedelmeyer.

01:15:31.873 --> 01:15:34.007
My husband
died last year.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.155
If it makes you feel better,
he suffered a lot.

01:15:40.267 --> 01:15:44.980
Well, anyway,
it made me feel better.

01:15:45.085 --> 01:15:48.374
I'm treating a young man
that was a patient...

01:15:48.449 --> 01:15:51.878
of Dr. Niedelmeyer's when he was
a child. His name is Richie Dexter.

01:15:51.942 --> 01:15:54.997
- Why don't you leave me alone?
- If I could just ask you a few questions.

01:15:55.071 --> 01:15:58.255
- You get out of here before I call the police!
- Just a few questions.

01:15:58.339 --> 01:16:01.289
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer...
- Get out of here!

01:16:09.874 --> 01:16:12.317
Fifty-eight.
Now, if I'm not mistaken...

01:16:12.389 --> 01:16:14.905
last week there were
59 books on the shelf...

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:17.960
and this week there are only
58 books on the shelf, so...

01:16:18.025 --> 01:16:22.333
Clark... what's
the ashtray situation?

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.767
Three. Not four,
as recommended.

01:16:27.841 --> 01:16:31.534
There are three chairs
and five assorted sofas.

01:16:31.619 --> 01:16:34.897
- Okay, let's get started.
... an emotional tar baby.

01:16:34.973 --> 01:16:37.445
Today I'd like to focus
on a most enlightening...

01:16:37.519 --> 01:16:40.161
and challenging topic.

01:16:40.236 --> 01:16:42.209
- Sex.
- More or less.

01:16:42.274 --> 01:16:45.191
You see, the primary romantic
relationship...

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:47.293
in our life is often
a symptom of our illness.

01:16:47.367 --> 01:16:49.331
- Glad I wore my rubber pants.

01:16:49.404 --> 01:16:53.034
We keep making the same neurotic choices
over and over every time we choose a new mate.

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:56.939
So...
if you had a magic wand...

01:16:57.014 --> 01:16:59.825
if you, uh,
had a wish list...

01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:02.202
and could change
your partner...

01:17:02.278 --> 01:17:04.410
Sondra, how would you
make them different?

01:17:04.474 --> 01:17:06.787
What's wrong?
What's missing?

01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:09.674
- Now?
- You need a minute to think about it?

01:17:09.747 --> 01:17:11.234
She's totally
forgot her Rolodex.

01:17:11.307 --> 01:17:14.598
- Sorry, sorry.

01:17:14.661 --> 01:17:18.333
Well, I don't have an attachment
in my life right now.

01:17:18.407 --> 01:17:21.484
The last one sort of
went to pieces.

01:17:21.602 --> 01:17:25.623
If you enjoy sex...

01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:28.254
a man thinks you're
doing it with everybody.

01:17:28.331 --> 01:17:31.068
- He was jealous.
- That's right.

01:17:31.141 --> 01:17:34.122
And I was as good as gold.

01:17:34.199 --> 01:17:37.340
Well, there's a good chance that he
was the one that was sleeping around...

01:17:37.424 --> 01:17:40.400
and projecting his fantasies
and desires onto you.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.500
This guy had a major projection,
and he couldn't keep it in his pants.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:49.000
- Anyway, I do have this girlfriend.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.600
She really makes me laugh.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:54.700
A wish list.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:00.410
- I wish... she was a guy.
- Fair enough.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.392
Casey, what do you got for us?

01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:14.405
Well... I met this girl
about a month ago.

01:18:14.467 --> 01:18:17.896
I've painted every inch
of her in detail.

01:18:17.967 --> 01:18:20.906
She's the best model I've ever seen.
Completely uninhibited.

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:23.730
- Does whatever I ask no matter how...
- I'll bet she does.

01:18:23.802 --> 01:18:27.240
That's right, Buck. See, but this
is where the problem comes in.

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:29.898
It's what you see
beneath the skin...

01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:33.596
when you study somebody endlessly,
the way an artist does.

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:37.899
I see a transcendental
beauty there...

01:18:37.972 --> 01:18:41.500
beyond anything I could
ever, ever imagine.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.600
How does this woman
feel about you?

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.500
She thinks I'm the living end
because I've got talent.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.371
But, I mean, what's talent?
Kick a garbage can...

01:18:49.443 --> 01:18:50.600
starving artists
crawl out, right?

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:53.800
But there's only one,
unique her.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.200
And, uh, I think
it's love, you know?

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.080
And, um...

01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:06.700
I don't know what to do
about that.

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:12.011
Do you think she loves you?

01:19:12.072 --> 01:19:16.100
No. No.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.605
Do you care, Casey?

01:19:22.751 --> 01:19:24.835
I don't know.

01:19:24.918 --> 01:19:28.742
He's a romantic.
He loves the suffering.

01:19:28.815 --> 01:19:32.680
Maybe being who I am...

01:19:32.753 --> 01:19:34.712
I have no choice.

01:19:34.817 --> 01:19:39.255
- Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.
- I agree.

01:19:39.349 --> 01:19:42.776
- Buck, what do you got?
- Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.

01:19:42.848 --> 01:19:43.621
It's not a contest.

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.500
Hey, Yard Sale,
you want to share the ashtray?

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.100
Thanks a lot.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.600
Forget it.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.788
You want to share something,
share the ashtray.

01:19:55.861 --> 01:19:57.100
I got something in my life,
something new.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.300
You know, she's young.

01:19:59.852 --> 01:20:03.400
Auburn hair, 5'5", 105.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.800
Pretty as hell.
I see her on weekends.

01:20:07.062 --> 01:20:10.646
I don't think she'd sleep with a man
unless she was married to him.

01:20:13.927 --> 01:20:15.400
Anything else
you'd like to tell us?

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.100
She doesn't mind
the gray, you know.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.400
She's fragile... you know?

01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.400
It's like she's running
through my fingers.

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:33.700
Two people I loved died.

01:20:35.526 --> 01:20:37.600
I never thought that
I could feel anything.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.300
Good, Buck.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:48.300
Richie.
How 'bout you?

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.300
I don't have,
really, relationships.

01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:58.200
- I have m-my brother.
- Okay. You want to talk about him?

01:20:58.998 --> 01:21:02.500
H- He worries
a- a lot about me.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.300
And he l-loves me.

01:21:05.729 --> 01:21:09.300
But I... I wish he didn't...

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.100
Love me so m...
so much sometimes.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:16.900
I wish I-I had more of a l-life.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:24.943
And I know that everyone
h- here thinks that I'm gay...

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.608
but I'm-I'm not.

01:21:29.681 --> 01:21:32.654
- A-And I don't want to be.
- What would you like to be?

01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:38.593
I'd like t-to be a w-woman.

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:40.780
Have you seen a doctor?

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:42.916
Yeah.

01:21:42.978 --> 01:21:45.901
- So the next step is the chop.
- Thank you, Buck.

01:21:47.962 --> 01:21:51.299
- Anything else you'd like to tell us, Richie?
- Nope.

01:21:51.414 --> 01:21:53.362
Very good.

01:21:53.467 --> 01:21:57.634
Hi, Clark. What would you change
about your partner?

01:21:57.715 --> 01:22:03.375
Um, I think
I'll pass... today.

01:22:03.448 --> 01:22:06.235
Excuse me.

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:10.174
You think you're
gonna pass today?

01:22:10.247 --> 01:22:14.454
Don't you think that's kind
of a betrayal to the rest of the group?

01:22:14.516 --> 01:22:18.953
I mean, we're all sitting here
sharing our most intimate thoughts...

01:22:19.036 --> 01:22:21.252
and you're just
gonna pass today?

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.633
Well, Sondra, I have
my little problems...

01:22:26.695 --> 01:22:30.073
- but I don't s-see how it's your
business... - Your "little problems"?

01:22:30.147 --> 01:22:33.827
- To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.
- Ah, I see.

01:22:33.897 --> 01:22:36.843
You're smiling.

01:22:36.916 --> 01:22:39.195
Is that a smile?

01:22:39.258 --> 01:22:41.848
You think
this is funny?

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.238
Look at you.
Just look at you.

01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:47.227
Look at your hair.

01:22:49.046 --> 01:22:51.400
Who do you think you are?
Huh?

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.720
You think you're
God's gift to women?

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.903
Let me tell you something.
You are nothing.

01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:59.500
Nothing
but a shallow, rigid...

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.200
self-protective,
anal coward!

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:06.200
- And I'll tell you what your little fucking problems are...
- Oh, shut up! Shut up, shut up!

01:23:06.566 --> 01:23:08.484
You promiscuous cunt!

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.600
And if you must know,
I do have somebody in my life!

01:23:14.362 --> 01:23:18.600
Black, emotional hole,
unattractive me!

01:23:20.130 --> 01:23:22.300
You can say that again.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:27.089
Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:29.116
- Is this what you call
"treatment failure"?

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:32.800
Well, it's not a total loss.

01:23:34.323 --> 01:23:35.800
He left without
counting everything.

01:23:36.716 --> 01:23:38.635
- Come on!
- Hey, right here! Hit it!

01:23:38.707 --> 01:23:40.852
So pretty soon
the relevant numbers weren't enough.

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:42.853
I had to know all
the irrelevant numbers...

01:23:42.916 --> 01:23:45.700
like the numbers of pages
in each deposition.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.800
- So you were fired.
- Yes.

01:23:50.046 --> 01:23:51.546
In effect.

01:23:52.305 --> 01:23:54.305
Obsessive-compulsive.

01:23:54.784 --> 01:23:56.784
Medical leave.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:01.600
"Just please,
please don't come back."

01:24:06.764 --> 01:24:09.500
I do apologize
for my outburst in group.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:13.100
You're screwing Sondra...

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.300
aren't you?

01:24:16.674 --> 01:24:19.500
I'm very fond of Sondra.

01:24:20.196 --> 01:24:23.762
More than that, perhaps.
Sondra is...

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:30.300
a very warmhearted woman,
but...

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:37.076
Tissues. Panty hose.

01:24:37.170 --> 01:24:40.006
CDs put back in the rack
without cases.

01:24:40.069 --> 01:24:43.466
Frying pans with
coagulating grease.

01:24:43.538 --> 01:24:46.237
Cotton balls.
Cotton balls.

01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:49.573
I mean, my God, the cotton balls
that woman used.

01:24:49.644 --> 01:24:53.908
Unspeakable items of underwear
left hanging in the shower.

01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.042
Chewed gum in the ashtrays.

01:24:56.117 --> 01:24:58.170
I made a list.

01:24:58.253 --> 01:25:01.181
There were 22 items
I couldn't take.

01:25:01.254 --> 01:25:03.505
It must be difficult
to find someone...

01:25:03.589 --> 01:25:05.673
to measure up to your
keen sense of order.

01:25:05.756 --> 01:25:09.915
I found someone.

01:25:10.028 --> 01:25:13.958
This woman thinks
I'm messy.

01:25:14.020 --> 01:25:17.751
It's perfect.
She comes, she goes.

01:25:17.824 --> 01:25:21.054
I don't even know she's been except
for the faint smell of perfume.

01:25:21.126 --> 01:25:25.149
Nice.

01:25:25.221 --> 01:25:28.423
And what does Sondra
think of this woman?

01:25:28.495 --> 01:25:31.089
Take a look at this.

01:25:36.999 --> 01:25:39.489
Sondra tried to do this
to my clothes...

01:25:39.573 --> 01:25:41.584
while I was wearing them;

01:25:41.667 --> 01:25:45.323
butcher knife in hand,
screaming.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.389
The next day she came back,
did this to my friend's dress.

01:25:49.503 --> 01:25:51.630
I'm terrified
to go near the woman.

01:25:55.507 --> 01:25:58.236
Hello?

01:25:58.308 --> 01:26:01.603
- Hello, this is Bill Capa.
- Hey, pukeface.

01:26:01.675 --> 01:26:05.708
Look around. Can't you see me?
I'm in the red car.

01:26:05.782 --> 01:26:09.011
You got doo-doo
in your eyes...

01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:14.180
or caca on the brain, Dr. Shithead Capa.

01:26:14.254 --> 01:26:17.547
Does your mommy know you escaped
from the straightjacket?

01:26:17.652 --> 01:26:20.945
Suck my tinkertoy,
you faggot cretin...

01:26:21.017 --> 01:26:23.810
- after you suck my scalpel, Doctor.

01:26:41.494 --> 01:26:43.757
- Goddamn it!

01:26:51.103 --> 01:26:55.126
- Fuck you!

01:26:57.168 --> 01:27:00.221
- Oh!

01:27:09.913 --> 01:27:12.738
- Oh, shit.
- Christ!

01:27:26.179 --> 01:27:28.545
Fuck you!

01:27:34.517 --> 01:27:37.852
Get the... You...

01:27:37.924 --> 01:27:40.718
Ohh! Get the fuck...

01:28:36.251 --> 01:28:39.972
Hey! You wanna die!

01:28:40.046 --> 01:28:43.702
- Huh? You wanna die?

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.693
I told you to stay
the fuck out of it.

01:29:10.755 --> 01:29:13.016
Hey.
? Como esta? Gracias.

01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:16.351
- I almost killed somebody out there.

01:29:16.425 --> 01:29:18.697
I mean, I had that car wedged
right on the railroad tracks.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:22.021
Christ, man.
It's a spooky feeling.

01:29:22.093 --> 01:29:24.031
Like mainlining
adrenalin, huh?

01:29:24.105 --> 01:29:26.032
The rush is really
something, huh?

01:29:26.106 --> 01:29:28.034
See? You're
my kind of guy!

01:29:32.098 --> 01:29:35.693
You want to hear what I found out
about your famous Monday group?

01:29:35.807 --> 01:29:39.528
Yeah, sure.
Can stand a little more pain.

01:29:39.642 --> 01:29:42.206
Well, Clark's wife
divorced him...

01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.645
after he put her
in intensive care.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.224
What'd she do?
Spill some wine on the rug?

01:29:48.295 --> 01:29:53.227
Then Sondra, she stabbed her father
with a knife... and a fork.

01:29:53.290 --> 01:29:56.046
- She must have been having dinner.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:59.209
One of her husbands
died of unnatural causes.

01:29:59.282 --> 01:30:02.102
Probably lost
some body fluids.

01:30:02.174 --> 01:30:04.672
And that,
that kid Richie.

01:30:04.743 --> 01:30:07.428
That Richie's
been busted for drugs...

01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:09.800
and Casey hates
his father so much...

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:12.700
he set the house on fire.
So what do you think of that?

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.800
I think it's good.
They should learn to assert themselves.

01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.400
Hey, the house is surrounded.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:20.400
Come out with your hands up
and your legs spread!

01:30:20.557 --> 01:30:23.000
- What the hell is this?
- Happy birthday, Hector!

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.204
Hey, Martinez, come on out!
We got something for you!

01:30:28.277 --> 01:30:31.210
- Martinez, happy birthday, man!
- Happy birthday!

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.800
- If I had known it was your birthday,
I'd have come by tomorrow. - Me too.

01:31:04.335 --> 01:31:07.261
Oy. Oigan, ¡vengan
a buscar el cake!

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:10.194
- Better get your cake.
- ¡Vengan a buscar el cake!

01:31:10.267 --> 01:31:14.709
- Everybody inside!

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.351
How come you didn't
mention Buck?

01:31:17.457 --> 01:31:18.787
There wasn't anything on him.

01:32:27.702 --> 01:32:29.200
You caught me
at a bad time.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.600
Can we get in
out of the rain?

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:53.567
Have a seat.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.100
I don't like guns.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.701
- Oh, shit!

01:33:34.755 --> 01:33:38.500
- Was it raining like this that night?
- Yeah.

01:33:41.079 --> 01:33:42.300
We were drivin'...

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.500
me, my wife, my daughter.

01:33:48.134 --> 01:33:50.800
This guy comes out
wavin', "Stop!"

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.900
So I slow down.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.392
My wife said,
"No, not here, Buck.

01:33:59.452 --> 01:34:02.800
It's a bad neighborhood.
Besides, the baby's asleep in the back."

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.800
And I said, "Bad neighborhood,
nothing." So I stopped.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.500
Never even made it
to the other car.

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:12.800
I could hear the shots being fired,
but my eyes wouldn't open. I...

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:15.500
- Oh, man!

01:34:16.265 --> 01:34:19.096
The rain brought me around.
This heavy, heavy rain.

01:34:19.158 --> 01:34:22.288
And I'm on the sidewalk,
and I crawl over...

01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:23.900
and pull my way up and...

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:28.700
There are two lateral shots...

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:32.100
to the head for my wife...

01:34:32.412 --> 01:34:34.900
and a single shot through
the heart for my daughter.

01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:37.200
Oh, Jesus, God!

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:40.900
Oh, Jesus.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
They got, uh...

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.900
They got $31.

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.500
- The rain nails me every time, man.

01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.976
- Did they ever find out who did it?
- No.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:35:00.300
I think it was some kind
of payback for something.

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.870
But that's a long story.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.724
Officer Anderson.
What can I do for you?

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:16.900
It's Dr. Bill Capa.
Remember me?

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.300
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The Bob Moore murder case.

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:22.300
- I need to talk to you.
- I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.600
- Okay.

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.360
Hey.

01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:02.900
Busy day?

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.300
Can I get you something?

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.200
No? Okay.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.500
Oh! I forgot about that!

01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:24.900
How did you get in here?

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:30.283
Last time I was here, I stole the key.
It was by the door.

01:36:30.339 --> 01:36:32.800
- What about the alarm?
- Oh!

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:35.800
- I never thought about that.
- It didn't go off?

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:38.100
No.

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:44.600
Um, did I make a mistake?

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:47.500
You have someone in the car?

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.300
No, goddamn it,
there isn't someone in the car!

01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.900
People are getting killed
around here!

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:54.900
You walk around like
it's goddamn Disneyland!

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.400
What if something
were to happen to you?

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.600
I just thought that it would be
a nice surprise, that's all.

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.200
You don't look
too happy to see me.

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.100
This is my happiness mode.

01:37:17.300 --> 01:37:19.700
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.700
I'm sorry.
Baby, I'm sorry.

01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:25.300
This is a very nice
surprise.

01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:27.800
- Really nice.

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:30.300
I'm sorry.

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.900
I'll never take a risk
like that again.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.800
Why don't you take
the biggest risk of all and give me...

01:37:37.850 --> 01:37:38.700
- your phone number.

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.700
Christ, Capa!

01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:45.800
I can't have people
tying up the phone lines.

01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:47.400
I'm trying to run
a business here.

01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:51.400
General Patton
comes out of the foothills.

01:37:51.485 --> 01:37:54.762
Oh, he's in the swamp.
Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:57.105
- Ooh! Ooh!
- And now... Oh, he's having a problem.

01:37:57.209 --> 01:37:59.951
- He's up in the Swiss Alps,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:38:00.054 --> 01:38:02.618
- Fire one. Fire... Oh!

01:38:02.733 --> 01:38:04.637
A direct hit!

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:07.973
- Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.

01:38:08.058 --> 01:38:09.994
Yeah?

01:38:10.069 --> 01:38:12.505
- It's goin' away.

01:38:12.569 --> 01:38:16.858
- How's the submarine fleet?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please.

01:38:16.929 --> 01:38:19.871
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Oh, you're chicken.

01:38:19.933 --> 01:38:21.880
- I gotta be up...
- You're chicken.

01:38:21.942 --> 01:38:24.446
- I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.
- You're chicken, chicken.

01:38:24.528 --> 01:38:27.709
Nobody told me Buck
was one of your patients.

01:38:27.771 --> 01:38:30.271
- "Nobody," Like Martinez?
- Right.

01:38:30.356 --> 01:38:35.201
That's the same "nobody" who
didn't tell me Buck was a cop.

01:38:35.275 --> 01:38:37.678
Fucking Martinez.

01:38:37.752 --> 01:38:40.527
That's a can of worms
you don't want to mess with.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.675
- What about Buck?
- Hey, look, you gotta promise...

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.530
if I tell you what I know about
this shit, it stays between me and you.

01:38:46.602 --> 01:38:50.032
And you never heard it
from me, okay? Two, Angelo.

01:38:50.105 --> 01:38:52.044
- Why?
- Why?

01:38:52.096 --> 01:38:55.661
- Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex?
- Right.

01:38:55.744 --> 01:38:57.673
Fucking asshole.

01:38:57.736 --> 01:39:01.269
I don't want to spend the rest of my
career getting pissed on from above, okay?

01:39:01.353 --> 01:39:05.804
- Okay.

01:39:05.918 --> 01:39:08.243
Martinez was nailin'
Buck's wife.

01:39:08.316 --> 01:39:12.976
- Holy shit.
- Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics.

01:39:13.059 --> 01:39:15.216
And those guys usually stick
together like shit on a shirt...

01:39:15.279 --> 01:39:18.186
so who knows how long it's been
going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.

01:39:18.249 --> 01:39:21.190
In the station, they had this
big fight in front of everybody.

01:39:21.262 --> 01:39:27.058
Two days later,
Buck's wife gets blown away.

01:39:27.131 --> 01:39:29.820
Jesus Christ!
Was there an investigation?

01:39:29.904 --> 01:39:31.884
Of course there was
an investigation.

01:39:31.968 --> 01:39:34.229
Martinez was a suspect.
Buck was a suspect.

01:39:34.303 --> 01:39:38.754
I mean nobody figured Buck forgiving her.
For a while, half the station was a suspect.

01:39:38.837 --> 01:39:42.465
- What do you think?
- I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the street.

01:39:42.579 --> 01:39:44.810
This was just payback
for both of 'em.

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:47.344
Hi, this is Casey.

01:39:47.417 --> 01:39:51.503
- Can't get to the phone right now,
but please leave a message.

01:39:51.586 --> 01:39:55.880
Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your
message and, sure, I can make it today.

01:39:55.954 --> 01:39:59.613
- Are you there?
- Hey!

01:39:59.685 --> 01:40:02.311
What... What the hell
are you doing here?

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:07.149
Hello? Listen,
Casey, y-you sounded a little upset.

01:40:07.233 --> 01:40:09.192
Just hang in there, okay?

01:40:09.286 --> 01:40:12.986
- Let me get this, huh? No?
- I'll be by this morning.

01:40:13.101 --> 01:40:16.656
- So I'll see you in 30.
- Well, you think you can do it in 30?

01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:50.721
- Casey!

01:40:57.570 --> 01:40:59.499
Casey!

01:41:49.565 --> 01:41:52.734
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:41:52.827 --> 01:41:54.828
- Casey!

01:41:54.944 --> 01:41:58.999
Hey!

01:42:00.082 --> 01:42:02.011
Casey!

01:42:45.938 --> 01:42:47.940
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Shit!

01:43:54.028 --> 01:43:57.113
- I love this song.
- I know.

01:44:00.491 --> 01:44:04.588
- You girls want to go dancing?
- Yeah. We're going to a party.

01:44:04.692 --> 01:44:09.289
- Hi.
- Hi...

01:44:09.404 --> 01:44:11.874
Well, pardon me!

01:44:18.535 --> 01:44:20.735
What are you doing?

01:44:23.882 --> 01:44:27.636
- Wha... No!

01:44:27.718 --> 01:44:30.231
Don't! Don't!

01:44:43.093 --> 01:44:45.356
- Ah!
- Sondra, go!

01:44:52.226 --> 01:44:55.165
Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.

01:44:57.937 --> 01:45:00.366
- Sondra, come here.
Oh, come here. My God!

01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:02.524
- Oh, my God!

01:45:02.607 --> 01:45:06.361
- These are your neighbors!
- They do this all the time.

01:45:08.071 --> 01:45:11.843
- Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!
- They're gonna see you!

01:45:11.948 --> 01:45:15.034
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- Oh, this is the part! This is the part!

01:45:15.147 --> 01:45:17.046
- Oh, my gosh!
- Oh!

01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:19.547
- Believe me, they can fuck.

01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:22.340
Oh, I can't watch this
anymore.

01:45:22.424 --> 01:45:24.895
I didn't see anything.

01:45:24.946 --> 01:45:28.751
Oh, Sondra, go.

01:45:28.824 --> 01:45:32.254
I love this song.

01:45:35.454 --> 01:45:37.893
Yeah.

01:45:37.965 --> 01:45:41.051
Sondra, through the window!
Look! Look!

01:45:44.231 --> 01:45:48.223
- Oh, what are they doing now?
- I can't tell.

01:45:48.338 --> 01:45:50.819
- Are they gonna do it? No!
- My God!

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:54.707
It's gonna happen right now.

01:45:55.917 --> 01:45:59.346
- Ow!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:46:02.380 --> 01:46:04.308
Oh, champagne.

01:46:11.719 --> 01:46:14.159
- Mmm.

01:47:10.198 --> 01:47:13.628
No, no, Sondra.
I can't. I can't.

01:47:13.701 --> 01:47:16.723
Why?
It's wonderful.

01:47:16.796 --> 01:47:22.071
- Sondra, I'm a jinx.
- No. We can cancel each other out.

01:47:22.133 --> 01:47:25.271
No.

01:47:25.375 --> 01:47:27.471
I'm not who you
think I am.

01:47:27.575 --> 01:47:31.942
Oh, God, I'm in love with somebody
and it's all falling apart.

01:47:32.015 --> 01:47:35.414
- I'm sorry.
- Look, the sky isn't falling down.

01:47:35.487 --> 01:47:38.344
- Yes, it is.
- No.

01:47:38.416 --> 01:47:41.783
Let's get that silly thing
off your head. There.

01:47:41.856 --> 01:47:45.307
I love your brown hair.

01:47:58.868 --> 01:48:00.953
- Who is it?

01:48:01.068 --> 01:48:03.996
I'm back.

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:13.837
Here she comes.

01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:15.900
Wearing a backpack on her back...

01:48:15.974 --> 01:48:19.383
making her look
even younger than she is.

01:48:19.445 --> 01:48:21.540
She falls into his arms.

01:48:23.083 --> 01:48:25.908
And they kiss.

01:48:28.023 --> 01:48:30.922
Oh, God.

01:48:31.016 --> 01:48:33.216
I'm so glad
that you're here.

01:48:33.319 --> 01:48:36.186
I didn't know
if you'd be in.

01:48:39.928 --> 01:48:42.753
I don't have to be anywhere
until this evening.

01:48:42.827 --> 01:48:45.953
Yeah?

01:48:46.038 --> 01:48:48.695
- So, what color are my nipples?

01:48:52.905 --> 01:48:56.272
- Oh, God.

01:48:56.346 --> 01:48:58.807
To be normal like this
all the time.

01:48:58.868 --> 01:49:02.830
Oh, God, this is better than normal.
This is much better than normal.

01:49:02.913 --> 01:49:06.176
It's just driving me
crazy, that's all.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:11.409
I mean, I don't really
know you... who you are...

01:49:11.491 --> 01:49:13.608
what you do...

01:49:13.682 --> 01:49:17.486
if you're safe,
when you're coming by.

01:49:17.559 --> 01:49:20.029
You have all the power.

01:49:20.082 --> 01:49:22.749
I just sit around here
and wait for you.

01:49:22.823 --> 01:49:26.815
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:49:26.889 --> 01:49:29.693
I mean, other things
happen, but...

01:49:29.765 --> 01:49:32.664
in the "what I wait for"
department, you're it.

01:49:32.726 --> 01:49:35.217
Oh, my.

01:49:35.301 --> 01:49:38.386
Bob's wife.

01:49:38.501 --> 01:49:41.940
My ex-wife.

01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:44.443
- She's pretty.
- Pretty fucked up.

01:49:44.506 --> 01:49:47.101
Oh, God.

01:49:47.173 --> 01:49:50.707
I forget
that he's dead.

01:49:58.984 --> 01:50:01.955
He looks so young here.
God, how long ago were these taken?

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:05.322
- Ten years ago.
- Really?

01:50:05.394 --> 01:50:07.324
Do you have anything
more recent?

01:50:07.396 --> 01:50:10.023
Maybe.
Hold on.

01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:15.934
I don't know why he kept
this hidden back here except maybe...

01:50:15.996 --> 01:50:19.864
because it had a picture of his wife
naked, which leads me to believe that...

01:50:19.927 --> 01:50:24.597
the relationship wasn't as dead
as they were pretending.

01:50:24.669 --> 01:50:28.431
- I don't know who these people are.
- No. It's morbid.

01:50:28.505 --> 01:50:32.664
I don't want to see anymore.
Let's go outside.

01:50:32.747 --> 01:50:37.334
Let's pretend it's Sunday.
Yeah? You wanna?

01:50:46.517 --> 01:50:51.323
One of my patients was killed
last night. He was murdered.

01:50:55.054 --> 01:50:57.359
What?

01:50:57.433 --> 01:50:59.402
The painter.

01:51:01.831 --> 01:51:04.957
- Casey.
- Were you there?

01:51:05.031 --> 01:51:08.460
- A little bit after.
- What did you see?

01:51:08.533 --> 01:51:11.004
You don't
want to know.

01:51:12.671 --> 01:51:16.800
About a half hour before group.
I'm gonna get a shower.

01:51:16.903 --> 01:51:20.240
- You gonna be okay out here?
- Yeah.

01:51:52.929 --> 01:51:57.391
- Rose.
- Oh! Oh!

01:51:57.506 --> 01:52:00.299
Rose! Rose!

01:52:12.578 --> 01:52:15.049
Rose! Jesus!

01:52:32.832 --> 01:52:35.094
2ASB...

01:52:35.157 --> 01:52:38.764
2ASB185.
2ASB185.

01:52:39.869 --> 01:52:42.799
- 2ASB...

01:52:42.871 --> 01:52:44.800
185.

01:52:58.548 --> 01:53:03.041
Oh! Stupid, crazy bastard!
They'll give anybody a license!

01:53:05.053 --> 01:53:08.045
Five and six are 31.

01:53:08.118 --> 01:53:12.058
Seven, seven,
that makes 45.

01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:17.385
And that will remain 45, and every single time
you count it, it will be 45, no matter what.

01:53:17.458 --> 01:53:20.429
And then this is five,
and that makes 50. And nine is 59.

01:53:20.501 --> 01:53:24.828
Now that's odd. That's really odd.
Now there's 59 again.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:29.028
- What?
- Well, last week...

01:53:29.101 --> 01:53:32.073
there were 58 books on the bookshelf
where there is always...

01:53:32.134 --> 01:53:36.575
and I mean always, 59 books, and this
week there are 59 again, so I don't...

01:53:42.080 --> 01:53:46.844
- Which one, Sondra?

01:53:46.905 --> 01:53:49.751
I didn't read any of it.
Really.

01:53:49.814 --> 01:53:53.181
- I felt so bad when I got it home. I couldn't help myself.
- Which one, Sondra?

01:53:53.244 --> 01:53:56.517
It... The Van Gogh.
But I didn't read any of it.

01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:59.456
- Honestly, I promise!
- What did I do?

01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:14.926
I was right about
the threats from the Monday group.

01:54:14.998 --> 01:54:19.658
This cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim
becomes tomorrow's monster.

01:54:19.742 --> 01:54:22.399
Today's the day.

01:54:22.472 --> 01:54:24.411
Hi.

01:54:27.778 --> 01:54:29.707
Hi, Bill.

01:54:29.779 --> 01:54:31.771
Hi, Buck.

01:54:31.843 --> 01:54:34.336
Casey, uh...

01:54:34.418 --> 01:54:36.910
is not gonna be joining us tonight,
so I think we should get started.

01:54:37.014 --> 01:54:40.381
- That's typical. Oh, shit!

01:54:40.454 --> 01:54:43.018
- Buck, are you all right?
- It's none of your fucking business.

01:54:43.122 --> 01:54:48.053
- You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.
- I'd like to start, if I may.

01:54:48.168 --> 01:54:53.756
I'd like to apologize
to the group and Sondra.

01:54:53.828 --> 01:54:58.560
Everything that you said last week in group
was right, and that's why I lost my temper.

01:54:58.633 --> 01:55:04.200
Uh, the young lady that
I mentioned last week...

01:55:04.272 --> 01:55:07.869
that relationship
has been terminated.

01:55:07.942 --> 01:55:12.164
No reason and no hope.
She just, just called...

01:55:13.915 --> 01:55:18.148
and told me,
and that's it.

01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:20.180
"The sociopath, lacking
the restraints that...

01:55:20.283 --> 01:55:22.974
hold a normal character
together, can become anything.

01:55:23.056 --> 01:55:26.778
Amorality frees her
to be universally perfect.

01:55:26.852 --> 01:55:30.885
A charming chameleon
with a scorpion's tail."

01:55:35.284 --> 01:55:39.130
Do any of you recognize...
recognize this woman?

01:55:45.063 --> 01:55:50.170
Oh, my God! Oh!

01:55:50.264 --> 01:55:53.567
This is my girlfriend.
This is Bonnie.

01:55:53.630 --> 01:55:56.633
- Give me that!

01:55:56.705 --> 01:56:01.616
- This your Bonnie? This is your Bonnie? Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:56:01.679 --> 01:56:03.669
The one you've been boring
the living shit out of us with?

01:56:03.741 --> 01:56:05.941
This is the one that's
saving you from yourself?

01:56:06.014 --> 01:56:08.006
- Your shopping mall hag?
- Shut up.

01:56:08.079 --> 01:56:10.278
- The one that makes you smile?
- Shut up!

01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:14.448
- The one that you wish was a man?
- What are you getting at, Buck?

01:56:14.521 --> 01:56:18.190
- That Bonnie? Is that it?
- That's right, that's it.

01:56:18.284 --> 01:56:20.254
- That's right, That's right.
- Sondra...

01:56:22.328 --> 01:56:24.225
this is my Bonnie.

01:56:30.865 --> 01:56:33.231
You're lying.
You're lying.

01:56:33.304 --> 01:56:35.232
You're lying.
You're lying!

01:56:35.306 --> 01:56:37.860
I don't
believe you!

01:56:41.967 --> 01:56:45.469
- Let me see that.

01:56:45.584 --> 01:56:47.909
- Fuckin' A!
- Well, yes, of course.

01:56:47.981 --> 01:56:50.776
This is the woman that I've been
talking about. This is my Bonnie.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:53.319
- Goddamn it, Buck! Don't do that! Do not do that!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:56:53.381 --> 01:56:55.508
- You're lying to me! Why are you lying to me?
- Stop acting like an...

01:56:55.611 --> 01:56:57.583
- Like an emotional child!
- Goddamn tar baby!

01:56:57.686 --> 01:57:01.116
- You're making it up! You're making it up!
- Nobody's making anything up...

01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:03.482
- and stop it, stop it, stop it!
- Stop it!

01:57:03.555 --> 01:57:06.150
Quit it!
You're crimpling the picture up!

01:57:06.223 --> 01:57:08.214
- I want you to stop! You're a little brat!
- Fuck it!

01:57:08.298 --> 01:57:10.779
You have
the emotions of a styrofoam cup!

01:57:10.862 --> 01:57:13.447
- You calm down, and you stop...
- Where's the picture?

01:57:26.436 --> 01:57:31.533
How in the name of God...

01:57:31.606 --> 01:57:36.016
could all of you be going out
with the same woman and not know?

01:57:36.078 --> 01:57:38.747
Not have a clue?

01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:43.917
Including you,
Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst?

01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:46.544
Not to mention Bob Moore...

01:57:46.628 --> 01:57:52.152
who probably took this amazing picture
himself in front of his expensive painting.

01:57:52.225 --> 01:57:56.092
I'm gonna call the Guinness Book
of World Records...

01:57:56.155 --> 01:57:59.532
because I think
this woman deserves credit.

01:57:59.626 --> 01:58:03.254
And I'm gonna make sure
that all of your names are included...

01:58:03.368 --> 01:58:05.724
so you can all share
in the glory.

01:58:05.797 --> 01:58:08.570
Well, you should know
something about sharing, huh, Hector?

01:58:08.633 --> 01:58:14.261
I mean, you and Buck must have
shared some very tender moments...

01:58:14.344 --> 01:58:17.608
discussing his wife. Huh?

01:58:17.671 --> 01:58:21.048
- Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- What truth is that?

01:58:21.111 --> 01:58:24.039
Why didn't you tell me
Buck was a cop...

01:58:24.112 --> 01:58:26.708
not to mention a suspect
in a murder case?

01:58:26.781 --> 01:58:28.844
- Not to mention you, goddamn it.
- Because...

01:58:28.918 --> 01:58:31.107
I'm not your patient,
and I don't have to tell you shit!

01:58:31.222 --> 01:58:35.088
That's right, you don't have to tell me
shit! Fuckin' tell me anything, do you?

01:58:35.161 --> 01:58:38.559
- Why won't somebody tell me some fucking truth?
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:58:38.633 --> 01:58:40.790
One fuckin' thing!
Can you do that, Buck?

01:58:40.853 --> 01:58:43.792
- You really know how to pick your women, you know that?
- I know you can't...

01:58:43.855 --> 01:58:47.222
- You lyin' sack of shit! You can't fuckin' do it!
- Listen.

01:58:47.296 --> 01:58:50.567
- After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this cocksucker!
- Don't! No more!

01:58:50.630 --> 01:58:55.092
But I realized we both loved her.
It became a, sort of a bond between us.

01:58:55.176 --> 01:58:58.626
Isn't that right, Hector?
Isn't it? Hector!

01:58:58.699 --> 01:59:03.442
Jesus God! I never got the chance
to forgive her.

01:59:05.339 --> 01:59:07.966
So I forgave him instead.

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.374
All right!

01:59:10.446 --> 01:59:14.710
So much for the famous
fucking Monday group!

01:59:14.784 --> 01:59:19.714
Now we have a suspect with a tattoo
on her ass and no address.

01:59:19.788 --> 01:59:22.278
Now the cops
need your help.

01:59:22.351 --> 01:59:25.280
What about the car?

01:59:25.353 --> 01:59:31.096
- Anybody around here wrote down
the license plates numbers?

01:59:31.159 --> 01:59:33.494
- "The license plates numbers"?
- We didn't even...

01:59:33.568 --> 01:59:37.966
- Huh? - Well, I didn't
think to-to-to write it down.

01:59:38.071 --> 01:59:41.230
- Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.
- Thanks. Put my bags in my room.

01:59:41.343 --> 01:59:44.669
Dr. Ashland from New York
with the psychiatric convention.

01:59:44.742 --> 01:59:47.609
Dr. Ashland? In the health club.

01:59:47.682 --> 01:59:49.767
I don't think she is a sociopath.

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:55.750
Well, then how about something simple and
snappy like a multiple personality disorder?

01:59:55.813 --> 01:59:58.940
You've fallen
into a trap.

01:59:59.013 --> 02:00:01.576
You are not well.

02:00:01.650 --> 02:00:04.016
She is not well.

02:00:04.088 --> 02:00:07.456
And to you,
it feels like a bond.

02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:11.761
She's been acting this
thing out as if...

02:00:11.824 --> 02:00:15.952
- it's the only way for her to have a life.
- Or lives.

02:00:16.056 --> 02:00:18.892
- You really want to go on seeing her, do you?
- Yes, I want to see her.

02:00:18.964 --> 02:00:22.091
In a, a nonprofessional
sense?

02:00:24.541 --> 02:00:27.199
In every sense.

02:00:27.273 --> 02:00:30.962
I don't have your
magical tuning fork.

02:00:31.035 --> 02:00:35.403
All I know is that
two people are dead...

02:00:35.476 --> 02:00:39.635
and she seems
an excellent suspect.

02:00:39.719 --> 02:00:44.586
Bill, salmon swim upstream
to mate and die.

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:48.610
- And so do men.
- Is that what I'm doing?

02:00:48.683 --> 02:00:53.478
- Anderson! I need your help with something.
- Hey, man, how ya doin'?

02:00:53.551 --> 02:00:55.521
I'm sitting in a restaurant last night,
and I'm looking out the window...

02:00:55.593 --> 02:00:58.347
watching this woman trying to back out
of a space right in front of mine.

02:00:58.429 --> 02:01:01.588
- A beautiful woman?
- Stunning.

02:01:01.661 --> 02:01:06.102
Anyway, the next thing I know, she
busted out the headlight on my car.

02:01:06.165 --> 02:01:09.031
- Uh-oh. Drives away, right? - I
don't even think she knew what she did.

02:01:09.094 --> 02:01:11.084
But you'd like to meet her?

02:01:11.168 --> 02:01:14.503
All right, um, I'll see what I can do.
You got the license number?

02:01:14.577 --> 02:01:18.267
- Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.
- Sure.

02:02:27.483 --> 02:02:29.921
Damn!

02:02:31.391 --> 02:02:33.862
- I ought to shoot you!
- I came to make amends.

02:02:33.966 --> 02:02:37.791
- So make 'em, loudmouth!
- I just spoke to Bill Capa.

02:02:37.864 --> 02:02:40.804
This license plate might
belong to our mystery lady.

02:02:44.994 --> 02:02:48.435
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer!

02:02:48.508 --> 02:02:50.665
It's Dr. Capa again.

02:02:50.738 --> 02:02:53.562
- You leave me alone! Get away from here!
- I need your help, please!

02:02:53.636 --> 02:02:56.544
- Why are you torturing me like this?
- Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please!

02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:02.736
- I need you to listen to me!

02:03:02.841 --> 02:03:05.477
- My best friend was killed. He was stabbed with a knife...
- You get out of my house!

02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:07.479
- 38 times in the chest!
- You-You go away!

02:03:07.552 --> 02:03:10.450
Another patient was bled to death!
I think that I might be next!

02:03:10.523 --> 02:03:14.014
- Go away!
- I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer!

02:03:14.088 --> 02:03:16.016
- What are you hiding from me? What is it?
- Nothing.

02:03:16.089 --> 02:03:19.060
- Why won't you tell me the truth? Put that phone down.
- I'm calling the police!

02:03:19.134 --> 02:03:22.323
- Put the phone down! Put the phone down!
- Please!

02:03:22.395 --> 02:03:26.200
What kind of twisted creature are you?
I've never done anything to you.

02:03:26.263 --> 02:03:29.494
- My patient Richie is involved...
- Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke?

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:33.029
- If you just help me...
- Richie Dexter is dead!

02:03:36.103 --> 02:03:41.399
He killed himself
four years ago.

02:03:46.810 --> 02:03:49.279
Why?

02:03:50.551 --> 02:03:53.178
Because he couldn't stand...

02:03:53.250 --> 02:03:57.482
what my husband
was doing to him.

02:04:08.063 --> 02:04:12.692
He hung himself with a belt.

02:04:12.765 --> 02:04:18.466
He was 12.

02:04:19.770 --> 02:04:21.792
I didn't know!

02:04:21.875 --> 02:04:24.773
I mean, how could I know?

02:04:24.836 --> 02:04:26.931
Nobody knew.

02:04:30.611 --> 02:04:32.903
What about
the family?

02:04:32.977 --> 02:04:38.105
He is survived
by his brother, Dale.

02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:41.233
If Richie Dexter
were alive today...

02:04:41.358 --> 02:04:45.257
he'd be 16 years old.

02:04:49.353 --> 02:04:52.553
He also had a sister, Rose.

02:06:38.170 --> 02:06:40.797
Richie.

02:06:44.768 --> 02:06:48.667
- Jesus Christ!

02:06:48.739 --> 02:06:51.274
What did he...
What did he do to you?

02:06:54.848 --> 02:06:56.871
W- What I... d-deserved.

02:06:56.974 --> 02:07:01.082
Y- You shouldn't be here.
Get away from me.

02:07:01.154 --> 02:07:07.983
Richie...

02:07:08.056 --> 02:07:11.288
I have to see Rose.

02:07:13.361 --> 02:07:16.290
- I need her.

02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:37.608
Get away from me, please!
You'll make it worse!

02:07:37.681 --> 02:07:41.079
- Where's Dale?
- I-I don't know, but he'll be back!

02:07:41.142 --> 02:07:43.809
I- I don't know where he is.

02:07:43.883 --> 02:07:47.646
Was this your idea,
to become Richie?

02:07:47.719 --> 02:07:50.315
No! No!

02:07:50.387 --> 02:07:53.723
I- It happened.
It just happened.

02:07:53.795 --> 02:07:56.549
What? What happened, Rose?
Please.

02:07:56.621 --> 02:08:00.155
- I need to know.
- When Richie died...

02:08:00.258 --> 02:08:05.054
Dale buried the body and then
he said, "Richie, come here."

02:08:05.127 --> 02:08:09.067
And I told him, I told him,
"My name is Rose!"

02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:12.497
He slapped me so hard,
I couldn't get up.

02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:17.260
A- And he, he made me
dress in these clothes...

02:08:17.333 --> 02:08:22.171
and h-he did things to me that
made me not want to be a woman anymore.

02:08:22.243 --> 02:08:26.277
- I was Richie from then on.
- What happened to Rose?

02:08:26.340 --> 02:08:31.281
After a while, I forgot about Rose.

02:08:31.385 --> 02:08:35.325
- Then Richie got busted.
- And you had to come to group.

02:08:35.388 --> 02:08:37.651
They were our world.

02:08:37.723 --> 02:08:42.852
- They were our family.
- But then what? Rose started coming back?

02:08:42.924 --> 02:08:46.417
No! Rose, Rose was too scared,
so Bonnie came out.

02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:48.825
- Bonnie was first.
- Oh, honey.

02:08:48.898 --> 02:08:51.869
Help me, please!
Help me.

02:08:55.569 --> 02:08:57.622
Jesus! Oh, my God!

02:08:57.705 --> 02:09:01.499
Oh! Jesus Christ!

02:09:01.573 --> 02:09:04.377
Jesus Christ!

02:09:08.682 --> 02:09:12.039
That crazy bastard!

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:15.876
Oh, God!

02:09:18.252 --> 02:09:20.452
- Rose!

02:09:20.514 --> 02:09:23.506
Get away f-from me!

02:09:23.588 --> 02:09:26.017
Rose, come back! Richie! Richie,
leave her alone!

02:09:26.091 --> 02:09:28.884
I never get
to be out a-anymore.

02:09:28.957 --> 02:09:32.898
Rose. Come on.

02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:35.555
- And then I met you and the fog...

02:09:35.639 --> 02:09:40.194
- started to lift.

02:09:40.298 --> 02:09:43.530
- It did. It did.
- I know. Come on, let's go.

02:09:43.602 --> 02:09:48.262
- Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh.

02:09:48.335 --> 02:09:51.307
Come here.

02:09:51.379 --> 02:09:53.308
Here we go.
Here we go. Let's move.

02:09:53.381 --> 02:09:55.310
- Oh!

02:09:58.916 --> 02:10:04.044
- Back up!
- No! No, Dale, don't!

02:10:04.117 --> 02:10:05.910
- Get back! Get back!
- Dale, no!

02:10:05.983 --> 02:10:08.006
Quick tongue,
slow wit.

02:10:08.089 --> 02:10:11.070
Deadly, Doctor.

02:10:11.195 --> 02:10:13.124
Deadly.

02:10:15.292 --> 02:10:17.877
Hi, Dale.

02:10:17.992 --> 02:10:20.983
You fucking daffodil.
Put that toy down.

02:10:21.088 --> 02:10:23.433
Put it in the toolbox.
Now!

02:10:23.496 --> 02:10:26.988
I got. 45 caliber nails
in this gun!

02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:30.302
- What are you doing here, Martinez?
- Aren't you glad I'm here?

02:10:30.365 --> 02:10:35.170
Anderson snitched you out! That's what
happens when you try to outsmart a cop!

02:10:35.232 --> 02:10:37.433
- Let that be your psych lesson
for the day!

02:10:40.602 --> 02:10:42.603
Go! Run!

02:10:42.676 --> 02:10:44.834
- Go! Get over there! Get over there!
- No! No!

02:10:44.949 --> 02:10:48.148
Go! Run! Run!

02:10:48.253 --> 02:10:52.339
- Run! Run! Go!

02:10:58.865 --> 02:11:01.617
Let's go!

02:11:05.295 --> 02:11:07.225
- No! Get out!

02:11:18.972 --> 02:11:22.777
- Come on! Come on!

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.708
You fucking son of a bitch!

02:11:37.475 --> 02:11:39.414
You really fucked
it up, didn't ya?

02:11:39.487 --> 02:11:41.822
- Got your little brother killed.
- No!

02:11:41.884 --> 02:11:43.812
- You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
- No, I saved him!

02:11:43.886 --> 02:11:45.919
- You knew what was happening...
- I didn't know!

02:11:45.992 --> 02:11:48.431
- Because it happened to you before!
- Would you goddamn shut up?

02:11:48.494 --> 02:11:50.484
Could have saved your little brother,
but he killed himself.

02:11:50.556 --> 02:11:53.529
- Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
- You failed, Dale.

02:11:53.591 --> 02:11:56.624
And you made
Rose become Richie!

02:11:56.740 --> 02:12:00.460
- Oh, you're smart. You're really smart.

02:12:00.533 --> 02:12:05.400
- Bob Moore was smart, but I put a stop to that.
- Yeah, you did.

02:12:05.474 --> 02:12:08.445
Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?

02:12:08.508 --> 02:12:13.136
Why are you head-shrinkers
all alike, huh?

02:12:13.208 --> 02:12:15.909
- Y-You can't keep your fucking
hands off of us.

02:12:15.982 --> 02:12:21.110
- Huh? Always pokin' and pushin'. Huh?

02:12:21.173 --> 02:12:24.414
Why'd you do it, Dale?

02:12:24.519 --> 02:12:28.387
Because...

02:12:28.459 --> 02:12:31.044
that little bitch, Rose,
she started sneaking out...

02:12:31.159 --> 02:12:34.953
playing like Bonnie,
modeling for him night after night.

02:12:35.025 --> 02:12:37.351
Christ, Bill, he was
lookin' right through her...

02:12:37.423 --> 02:12:40.759
gonna recognize
Richie in group.

02:12:40.832 --> 02:12:42.917
Well, I might have
missed old Niedelmeyer...

02:12:43.001 --> 02:12:46.117
but I sure as hell
got Bob... real good.

02:12:46.201 --> 02:12:49.099
- And now...

02:12:49.172 --> 02:12:52.935
I'm gonna cut you into little
pieces and sand the skin off.

02:12:53.008 --> 02:12:56.239
The inspiration of madness, Dale.

02:12:56.312 --> 02:12:59.908
The tyranny
of normalcy, Bill.

02:13:14.721 --> 02:13:17.213
- Richie.

02:13:17.295 --> 02:13:20.653
My name is...
My name is Rose.

02:13:25.363 --> 02:13:29.356
- No! No!

02:13:33.932 --> 02:13:36.497
No!

02:13:36.611 --> 02:13:38.362
No!

02:13:42.845 --> 02:13:46.911
Rose!

02:13:46.973 --> 02:13:49.413
Come back!
Rose!

02:13:49.486 --> 02:13:54.780
- Rose!

02:13:54.853 --> 02:13:57.481
Rose! Stop!

02:13:57.553 --> 02:13:59.711
- Rose!

02:13:59.794 --> 02:14:01.723
Wait!

02:14:01.785 --> 02:14:03.714
Rose!

02:14:03.787 --> 02:14:08.780
- Don't!
- For God's sakes, don't jump!

02:14:08.895 --> 02:14:11.490
- Rose!
- No!

02:14:11.594 --> 02:14:16.035
- Rose! Stop!

02:14:16.098 --> 02:14:18.193
- No!
- No.

02:14:18.266 --> 02:14:20.861
No!

02:14:20.935 --> 02:14:24.635
- Wait!
- Why?

02:14:24.708 --> 02:14:28.867
Rose! No!
Stop, please!

02:14:28.941 --> 02:14:31.807
- Just stay there!
- It's too late.

02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.372
I've gone too far.
I can't go back.

02:14:35.444 --> 02:14:37.467
If you go, I go!
I swear to God!

02:14:37.551 --> 02:14:41.240
- I swear to God.
- Why would you do that?

02:14:41.345 --> 02:14:44.242
Please, God, just come over here.
I don't want you to die.

02:14:44.316 --> 02:14:50.091
Just give me your hand. Take a risk!
There's no risk in dying.

02:14:50.153 --> 02:14:53.145
- Come on.
- Oh, Capa.

02:14:53.227 --> 02:14:55.656
- Come on.

02:14:55.719 --> 02:14:57.658
- I... No...
- No!

02:14:57.721 --> 02:14:59.753
- Capa!

02:14:59.836 --> 02:15:03.558
No!

02:15:23.021 --> 02:15:25.011
Come on.

02:15:56.804 --> 02:15:59.795
Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils!

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.101
- You gonna leave me hanging
here all night, huh?

02:16:04.173 --> 02:16:06.301
Get me down,
you goddamn cuckoos!

02:16:06.373 --> 02:16:08.438
- Get me some fucking Band-Aids!

02:16:08.511 --> 02:16:12.544
Come on, you fucking daffodils!
Get me out of here!

02:18:59.568 --> 02:19:02.236
Hey! You gonna spend the night up there?

02:19:02.299 --> 02:19:05.228
You and little
Miss Fender Bender?
