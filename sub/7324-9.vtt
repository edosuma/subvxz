WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.174
(Meredith)
"I HAD A TERRIBLE DAY."

00:03.174 --> 00:04.375
WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

00:04.375 --> 00:06.177
A FIGHT WITH THE BOSS,

00:06.177 --> 00:08.008
THE STOMACH FLU,

00:08.008 --> 00:09.340
TRAFFIC...

00:09.340 --> 00:12.243
(muffled voice) OKAY,
TRY AND BREATHE FOR ME.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.315
(muffled voice) I'M TRYING.

00:17.248 --> 00:19.320
(coughs)

00:19.320 --> 00:21.252
OKAY, OKAY.

00:21.252 --> 00:23.154
(coughs)

00:23.154 --> 00:25.296
THAT'S WHAT WE DESCRIBE
AS TERRIBLE

00:25.296 --> 00:28.199
WHEN NOTHING TERRIBLE
IS HAPPENING.

00:28.199 --> 00:29.330
(coughs)

00:29.330 --> 00:31.202
OKAY, OKAY.

00:31.202 --> 00:33.064
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
(coughs)

00:33.064 --> 00:34.235
LET'S GET
A GOOD LINE IN HIM.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.167
OKAY, AND WHERE IS X-RAY?
GET THEM IN HERE, STAT.

00:36.167 --> 00:37.338

00:37.338 --> 00:38.369
WITH HIS, UH, V.H.L.

00:38.369 --> 00:41.172

00:41.172 --> 00:43.374
UH, WHEN, UH, WHEN WAS
YOUR LAST C.T.?

00:43.374 --> 00:44.415
IT WAS, UH, IT WAS JUNE.

00:44.415 --> 00:46.077

00:46.077 --> 00:48.179
OKAY, THEN LET'S PAGE
DR. WEBBER, PLEASE.

00:48.179 --> 00:49.380

HIS VEINS ARE SHOT.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.252
LET'S GO AHEAD AND PUT IN
A CENTRAL LINE.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.423
WE'RE GONNA PUT A LINE IN
SO WE CAN GIVE YOU I.V. FLUIDS.

00:52.423 --> 00:55.086
AND ONCE WE GET THE X-RAY,
WE SHOULD HAVE A BETTER IDEA

00:55.086 --> 00:57.057
OF WHAT'S GOING ON.

01:00.391 --> 01:02.293
WE GOT HIM. OKAY?

01:04.135 --> 01:06.197
(voice breaks)
YEAH. YEAH.

01:06.197 --> 01:07.268

01:07.268 --> 01:09.069
(exhales deeply)

01:09.069 --> 01:10.141
(monitor beeping rapidly)

01:10.141 --> 01:11.202
(siren whoops)

01:11.202 --> 01:13.073
OKAY, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT THE EYE?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
GOOD. WE'LL--
WE'LL BE WAITING.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.147
(whispers) OKAY.

01:16.147 --> 01:17.248
(normal voice)
OH, HEY, AVERY.

01:17.248 --> 01:19.280
WE GOT A KID WITH HALF
HIS FACE TORN OFF BY A DOG,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.412
SO CAN YOU GET SLOAN
AND MEET ME OUTSIDE?
YEAH.

01:21.412 --> 01:23.083
AND, HEY, SEE
IF SHEPHERD'S STILL HERE,

01:23.083 --> 01:24.155
'CAUSE WE MAY NEED HIM.
OKAY.

01:24.155 --> 01:25.416
DR. ROBBINS.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.218
YOU'RE POPULAR TONIGHT.

01:27.218 --> 01:28.219
(siren wailing)

01:28.219 --> 01:29.290
HEY, THIS IS ROBBINS.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.091
RIGHT NOW?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.223
WELL, WHERE?

01:32.223 --> 01:33.394
(wailing continues)

01:33.394 --> 01:36.167
THAT WAS PATHETIC.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.198
SHUT UP.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.299
(laughing)

01:38.299 --> 01:40.100
(laughs) SHE TOLD YOU
TO GO SCREW YOURSELF.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.372
WE COULD HEAR IT
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE.

01:41.372 --> 01:43.103
IT'S NOT 'CAUSE
SHE WASN'T INTO ME.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.105
OH, DOES "GO SCREW YOURSELF"
HAVE SOME SECRET MEANING

01:45.105 --> 01:46.437
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF?

01:46.437 --> 01:49.480
I KINDA ALREADY KNEW HER.
I JUST DIDN'T REMEMBER.

01:51.242 --> 01:54.185
YOU SLEPT WITH HER BEFORE
AND FORGOT ABOUT IT

01:54.185 --> 01:56.147
AND THEN TRIED TO
PICK HER UP ALL OVER AGAIN?

01:56.147 --> 01:57.288
YOU'RE NOT EVEN DRINKING.

01:57.288 --> 01:59.290
I HAVE A HISTORY OF ALZHEIMER'S
IN MY FAMILY.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.321
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.322
IT'S O'MALLEY'S FAULT.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.423
I MEAN,
TALKING ABOUT DEAD PEOPLE,

02:02.423 --> 02:04.124
IT THROWS ME OFF MY GAME,
THAT'S ALL.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.196
(Meredith and Cristina) MM.

02:05.196 --> 02:07.298
(cell phone rings)
IT'S JANET.

02:07.298 --> 02:08.429

YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

02:08.429 --> 02:10.161
(pager beeps)
THANK YOU. HEY, HEY, JANET.

02:10.161 --> 02:11.232
I GOTTA RUN.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.403

02:12.403 --> 02:14.335
NO. I'M LEAVING. I'M GOING
TO THE SKILLS LAB.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.366
OH, COME ON.

02:15.366 --> 02:17.168
SHE HAD THE SOCIAL WORKER
ON THE PHONE.

02:17.168 --> 02:19.170
YOU CAN FISH 20 BUCKS
OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

02:19.170 --> 02:22.173
(indistinct conversations)

02:27.278 --> 02:29.380
I WANT TO SEE YOU
FOR A FOLLOW-UP NEXT WEEK.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.183
AND LISTEN, I KNOW DREW

02:32.183 --> 02:34.185

02:36.427 --> 02:38.359
AND I AM NOT KIDDING
ABOUT PHYSICAL THERAPY.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.231
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
ALL THE SUPPORT YOU CAN GET

02:40.231 --> 02:42.233
TO KEEP UP WITH...
(laughs) THAT LITTLE ONE.

02:42.233 --> 02:44.395
I'M GONNA DO IT.
I REALLY AM.

02:44.395 --> 02:46.537
YOU FEELIN' OKAY?

02:46.537 --> 02:49.300
I STILL KINDA LIKE THE IDEA OF
KEEPING YOU HERE ANOTHER DAY.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.441
NO, IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.

02:50.441 --> 02:53.274
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD ON DREW.
HE NEEDS HIS MOM.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.545
I JUST WANT TO GET HOME.

02:54.545 --> 02:56.377
OKAY.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.378

02:57.378 --> 02:58.549
HEY, SWEETHEART!

03:01.252 --> 03:02.283

03:06.317 --> 03:07.458

03:07.458 --> 03:08.519
OH.

03:08.519 --> 03:10.190
YEAH, JUST STITCHES.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.292

03:11.292 --> 03:13.193
HEY, DREW.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.526

03:23.404 --> 03:24.475
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:24.475 --> 03:25.536
ANYTIME.
HEY, YOU.

03:25.536 --> 03:26.537
BYE.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.208
HEY, LOOK.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.311
WHAT DID JANET SAY?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.582
MEREDITH?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.416
WE'RE NOT GETTING HER BACK.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.489
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT--
WHAT EXACTLY DID SHE SAY?

03:38.489 --> 03:41.221
THAT WE'RE
NOT GETTING HER BACK.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.353
SHE SAID THAT?

03:42.353 --> 03:44.495
SHE SAID THAT THE COURT...

03:44.495 --> 03:47.258
CANCELED OUR HEARING DATE.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.431
AND WHEN THEY DO THAT, IT MEANS
EITHER ONE OF TWO THINGS--

03:50.431 --> 03:52.303
THAT THEY LOOKED AT OUR FILE

03:52.303 --> 03:54.234
AND THEY LOVE US
AND THEY'RE GIVING HER TO US,

03:54.234 --> 03:56.367
IN WHICH CASE THEY CALL JANET
AND THEY TELL HER THAT,

03:56.367 --> 03:59.270
OR THAT THEY HATE US

03:59.270 --> 04:02.513
AND THEY'RE GIVING HER
TO ANOTHER FAMILY.

04:02.513 --> 04:05.476
AND SHE DIDN'T GET
THE "THEY LOVE US" CALL.

04:05.476 --> 04:08.379
WELL, MAYBE THEY DIDN'T
GET AROUND TO IT.

04:08.379 --> 04:11.282
SHE SAID WE SHOULD MOVE ON.

04:11.282 --> 04:12.453
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.584
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HER EXACT WORDS--

04:13.584 --> 04:15.586
WERE "I THINK IT'S TIME
THAT YOU AND DEREK

04:15.586 --> 04:19.330
START THINKING ABOUT
MOVING ON."

04:21.261 --> 04:22.593
OH, MY GOD.

04:22.593 --> 04:25.366
(whispers) OH, GOD.
HOW CAN THEY DO THIS?

04:28.539 --> 04:29.640
(inhales)

04:29.640 --> 04:30.641
(sighs deeply)

04:30.641 --> 04:32.303
YOU CAN CRY.

04:32.303 --> 04:33.374
I DON'T WANT TO CRY.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.475
I KNOW.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.451
I'M NEVER
GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.

04:40.451 --> 04:42.353
GOD.

04:44.355 --> 04:45.486
OKAY, STOP.
I DON'T WANT TO CRY.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.658
OKAY. I KNOW.

04:47.658 --> 04:49.320
(exhales)

04:49.320 --> 04:50.391
(slaps legs)

04:50.391 --> 04:51.462
(sniffles)

04:51.462 --> 04:53.564
(exhales deeply)

04:53.564 --> 04:56.567
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:59.670 --> 05:02.333
(coughs)

05:05.506 --> 05:07.638
CALL UP TO C.T.
TELL 'EM WE'RE ON OUR WAY UP.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.510
SCREW C.T. AND GO
STRAIGHT TO THE BRONCHOSCOPE.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.342
YOU NEED TO FIND OUT
WHAT IS DOWN THERE.

05:11.342 --> 05:14.385
C.T. WILL CLARIFY
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH.

05:14.385 --> 05:16.617
IT WON'T DELAY ANYTHING,
AND YOU'RE NOT HIS DOCTOR.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.419
RICHARD IS.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.320
I HEAR HE'S GOOD.
I MEAN, I-I DON'T KNOW.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.592
HE'S NEW AROUND HERE.

05:21.592 --> 05:24.555
(Henry) SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
WHEN I'M IN THE HOSPITAL.

05:24.555 --> 05:27.398
MAKES YOU WONDER WHY SHE MARRIED
A GUY WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS.

05:27.398 --> 05:29.360
MASOCHIST. CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

05:31.502 --> 05:33.434
(coughs)
I'M COMING TO C.T.

05:36.407 --> 05:38.669
I WOULDN'T HAVE IT
ANY OTHER WAY.

05:38.669 --> 05:40.411
GOOD. (exhales)

05:45.416 --> 05:46.617
(exhales)

05:48.649 --> 05:50.621
MEREDITH IS IN THE E.R.

05:50.621 --> 05:52.723
LOOK AT THIS.
SCALPELS FROM THE 1860s.

05:52.723 --> 05:53.724
I WANT TO GET 'EM
FOR MEREDITH.

05:53.724 --> 05:55.386
SHE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU.

05:55.386 --> 05:56.387
OH, CAN YOU DISTRACT HER?

05:56.387 --> 05:57.458
IT'S ON eBay,

05:57.458 --> 05:59.390
AND I GOT 25 MINUTES LEFT
ON THE AUCTION.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.532
DEREK, JANET CALLED.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.669
THE BABY WAS BORN
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO,

06:08.669 --> 06:10.571
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
A TRACHEOESOPHAGEAL FISTULA.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.642
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

06:11.642 --> 06:13.373
YEAH, IT'S THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN, UH,

06:13.373 --> 06:14.445
THE TRACHEA AND ESOPHAGUS.

06:14.445 --> 06:15.576
FILLS THE LUNGS
WITH SECRETIONS.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.377
BABY CAN HAVE A HARD TIME
BREATHING AND FEEDING.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.580
EXACTLY BENTLEY HOSPITAL
IS TINY. THEY CAN'T HANDLE IT.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.582
SO YOU NEED TO GO PICK UP
THE BABY, BRING HER BACK,

06:21.582 --> 06:23.383
AND THEN HOPEFULLY,
I'M DONE WITH THE KID

06:23.383 --> 06:24.655
THAT'S ON HIS WAY IN
BY THE TIME YOU'RE BACK.

06:24.655 --> 06:25.716
YOU NEED TO RECONFIGURE
THE AMBULANCE

06:25.716 --> 06:27.458
FOR INTENSIVE
NEONATAL TRANSPORT.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.420
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD GET
SOMEONE ELSE TO GO--

06:29.420 --> 06:30.621
GREY, RIDE WITH KAREV.
HE'S ON A BABY RUN.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.423
WELL, I HAVE TO TALK
TO DEREK.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.495
WELL, NEWBORN LIFE HANGING
IN THE BALANCE. MAKE IT FAST.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.396
(siren wails and whoops)

06:36.396 --> 06:38.499
10-YEAR-OLD MALE,
DOG BITE TO THE FACE.
(boy groaning)

06:38.499 --> 06:39.730
VITAL SIGNS
STABLE IN THE FIELD.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.532
ALL RIGHT, TRAUMA THREE.

06:41.532 --> 06:44.435
(siren wails)

06:44.435 --> 06:45.606
(laughs)

06:45.606 --> 06:46.677
LAURA.

06:46.677 --> 06:48.679
HEY, DR. AVERY.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.481
HONEY, THIS IS MY GUY.

06:50.481 --> 06:51.482
YOU MUST BE GRIFFIN.

06:51.482 --> 06:52.683
YEAH.

06:52.683 --> 06:54.414
AND DREW.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.686
HEY, YOUR MOM SAID THAT
YOU WERE A KID,

06:55.686 --> 06:57.548
BUT YOU ARE ALMOST
AS TALL AS ME.

06:57.548 --> 06:58.689
YOU'RE NOT THAT TALL.

06:58.689 --> 06:59.690
(laughs)

06:59.690 --> 07:01.652
AH. HEY.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.654
SO, LISTEN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
TAKING SUCH GOOD CARE OF HER.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.456
MY PLEASURE.
HOW YOU FEELIN'?

07:05.456 --> 07:07.458
OH, JUST READY TO GO HOME.

07:07.458 --> 07:08.599
OKAY, BUT YOU MAKE SURE
TO GIVE ME A PAGE

07:08.599 --> 07:09.800
WHEN YOU COME IN
FOR A FOLLOW-UP, ALL RIGHT?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.802
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:11.802 --> 07:14.465
OKAY.

07:14.465 --> 07:18.569
I, UH, SEE WHAT YOU MEAN
ABOUT THOSE EYES.

07:18.569 --> 07:19.640
WOW.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.441
IF I WEREN'T
SUCH A CONFIDENT GUY,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.574
I MIGHT HAVE TO, LIKE, CHALLENGE
HIM TO A DUEL OR SOMETHING.

07:23.574 --> 07:24.645
(gasps)

07:26.617 --> 07:28.549
(gasping)
HONEY.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.821
CAN WE GET SOME HELP,
PLEASE?

07:30.821 --> 07:34.725
(panting)

07:36.456 --> 07:37.528
(Derek) MAYBE THERE'S
AN APPEAL PROCESS.

07:37.528 --> 07:38.589
DID YOU ASK?

07:38.589 --> 07:39.590
I DIDN'T.

07:39.590 --> 07:40.591
YOU TALK TO THE LAWYER?

07:40.591 --> 07:41.792
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH JANET.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.634
WE'LL APPEAL. WE'LL SUE
THE AGENCY IF WE HAVE TO.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.796
THEY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BE ZOLA'S PARENTS, DEREK.

07:45.796 --> 07:47.598
THEY DON'T THINK
I'M TRUSTWORTHY,

07:47.598 --> 07:49.670
AND THEY'RE NOT THE FIRST ONES
TO RAISE THAT CONCERN.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.502
MEREDITH.

07:51.502 --> 07:54.474
THEY DON'T THINK I SHOULD
BE ZOLA'S MOTHER.

07:55.506 --> 07:56.647
SHE'S GONE.

07:56.647 --> 07:57.808
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
(sighs)

07:57.808 --> 07:59.580
OKAY?

07:59.580 --> 08:01.512
WE'RE GONNA FIND A WAY.

08:01.512 --> 08:03.754
ZOLA WAS OUR BABY,

08:03.754 --> 08:06.757
AND SHE'S GONE, AND I
DON'T WANT ANOTHER BABY.

08:06.757 --> 08:07.788
(sighs)

08:13.824 --> 08:21.532
(engine turns over)

08:26.506 --> 08:27.507
SHE'S BARELY GOT
ANY PULSE.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.579
WHAT WAS SHE IN FOR?

08:28.579 --> 08:29.810
A THORACIC SPINAL FUSION
TO FIX HER SCOLIOSIS.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.542
MM-HMM.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.844
DR. TORRES JUST RELEASED HER,
AND SHE WAS DOING FINE.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.746
OKAY, HEART SOUNDS
ARE MUFFLED.

08:35.746 --> 08:37.517
LET'S CALL ALTMAN.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.590
SHE'S NOT PROTECTING HER AIRWAY.
I'M GONNA INTUBATE.

08:39.590 --> 08:40.751
IS SHE OKAY?
SIR, THERE'S A WAITING ROOM.

08:40.751 --> 08:41.752
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

08:41.752 --> 08:42.823
TAKE YOUR SON OUT OF HERE.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.595
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN WE KNOW.

08:44.595 --> 08:45.626
WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE ULTRASOUND,

08:45.626 --> 08:47.628
AND SOMEBODY FIND TORRES.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.299
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

08:49.299 --> 08:50.761
(Teddy) THEY CAN
PUT ON SOME MUSIC.

08:50.761 --> 08:53.564
(Henry) NAH,
I'LL JUST TAKE A NAP.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.566
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

08:55.566 --> 08:56.637
I DO.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.768
GOOD.

08:57.768 --> 08:59.570
I JUST WISH
I HADN'T SPENT THE DAY

08:59.570 --> 09:01.612
TRYING TO KILL
YOUR HOPES AND DREAMS.

09:01.612 --> 09:03.644
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY I STARTED
SPITTING UP BLOOD,

09:03.644 --> 09:04.645
SO I'D WIN.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.676
(laughs)

09:05.676 --> 09:06.677
(laughs)

09:06.677 --> 09:07.748
(sighs)

09:07.748 --> 09:09.720
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE YOU GO
TO MEDICAL SCHOOL.

09:09.720 --> 09:10.881
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HAPPY.

09:10.881 --> 09:12.883
NO, I AM. I'M NOT--

09:12.883 --> 09:16.326
I-I LOVE MED STUDENTS.

09:16.326 --> 09:17.828
I'LL HELP YOU STUDY.

09:17.828 --> 09:19.890
YOU'LL BE MY STUDY BUDDY?

09:19.890 --> 09:22.593
(laughs)
I'LL MAKE YOU FLASH CARDS.

09:22.593 --> 09:23.764
(chuckles and clears throat)

09:23.764 --> 09:25.696
THAT'S SO HOT, I'M NOT SURE
I CAN EVEN HANDLE IT.

09:25.696 --> 09:27.768
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.600
IT'S YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.702
YEAH. WHATEVER.
MM-HMM.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.745
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

09:34.745 --> 09:36.807
MM-HMM.

09:39.810 --> 09:40.811
(coughs)

09:40.811 --> 09:41.882
DON'T MOVE.

09:41.882 --> 09:42.883
MM-HMM.

09:44.354 --> 09:45.716
WHERE'S BAILEY?

09:45.716 --> 09:48.358
UH, HENRY DOESN'T NEED
BOTH OF US,

09:48.358 --> 09:51.762
AND WE ALL AGREED
THAT YOU'D BE LESS OF A HASSLE

09:51.762 --> 09:52.923
WITH THE FORMER
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.725
NICE. YOU'RE NICE PEOPLE.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.727
SO ARE YOU PLANNING TO GET
A LOOK WITH CONTRAST

09:56.727 --> 09:58.598
OR JUST
THE NON-CONTRAST STUDY?

09:58.598 --> 09:59.599
WHICH WOULD YOU PREFER?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.731
BOTH.

10:00.731 --> 10:03.674
UM, CAN YOU GET
SOME CONTRAST READY?

10:03.674 --> 10:04.675
THANKS.

10:04.675 --> 10:05.736
(pager beeps)

10:05.736 --> 10:07.638
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:07.638 --> 10:08.709
THE E.R.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.841
OWEN WANTS A CONSULT.
WELL, GO AHEAD.

10:10.841 --> 10:12.843
IT'LL TAKE FIVE MINUTES,
AND WE DON'T BOTH NEED

10:12.843 --> 10:14.915
TO STAND HERE WATCHING
THE C.T. LOAD.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.747
ARE YOU SURE?

10:16.747 --> 10:18.618
IF YOU'RE NOT BACK IN FIVE,
I'LL FIND YOU

10:18.618 --> 10:19.890
AS SOON AS THE FILM
COMES UP.
YOU WILL?

10:19.890 --> 10:22.392
I SAID I WOULD,
DIDN'T I?

10:23.854 --> 10:25.395
THANK YOU.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.730
(beeps)

10:29.730 --> 10:31.732
(beeping)

10:31.732 --> 10:33.704
(sighs)

10:33.704 --> 10:34.865
(beeping continues)

10:35.936 --> 10:37.738
(exhales) OH.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.970
LOOK AT THAT.

10:39.970 --> 10:40.971
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

10:40.971 --> 10:42.673
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU.

10:42.673 --> 10:43.814
SHE'S IN SHOCK AND...

10:43.814 --> 10:45.916
IT LOOKS LIKE HER PERICARDIUM'S
FULL OF BLOOD.

10:45.916 --> 10:48.919
SHE JUST HAD SPINAL SURGERY.
WH-WHY WOULD SHE--
I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD ANSWER THAT.

10:48.919 --> 10:50.821
(monitor beeping erratically)
SHE'S ARRESTING.

10:52.723 --> 10:53.884
UH...

10:53.884 --> 10:56.426
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA DO
A THORACOTOMY.

10:56.426 --> 10:57.858
OPEN UP A CHEST TRAY.
KEPNER...

10:57.858 --> 10:59.429
PREP THE CHEST.

10:59.429 --> 11:00.831
YOU'RE GONNA CRACK HER CHEST?
SHE'S NOT A TRAUMA.

11:00.831 --> 11:02.733
YES, BUT SHE'S DYING.

11:02.733 --> 11:03.894
(gloves snap)

11:03.894 --> 11:07.698
(beeping continues)

11:14.845 --> 11:16.676
IT'S PROBABLY A MISTAKE.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.448
YOU KNOW, COURTS--
THEY SCREW UP ALL THE TIME.

11:18.448 --> 11:19.880
YOU CALL 'EM IN THE MORNING--

11:19.880 --> 11:21.681
IT'S OVER, ALEX.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.453
IT'S BEEN OVER FOR A WHILE.
EVERYONE KNEW IT.

11:23.453 --> 11:24.885
NO ONE WANTS TO SAY IT.

11:27.017 --> 11:29.760
SO GET--GET A SURROGATE
OR WHATEVER.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.862
YOU CAN'T JUST WRITE OFF
HAVING A FAMILY LIKE THAT.

11:31.862 --> 11:32.923
GET YANG
TO CARRY A KID FOR YOU.

11:32.923 --> 11:34.464
SHE GETS KNOCKED UP
AT THE DROP OF A--

11:34.464 --> 11:35.926
IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP
IN THE NEXT THREE SECONDS,

11:35.926 --> 11:37.998
I'M GONNA SHOVE YOU OUT OF
THE BACK OF THE RIG.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.803
(monitor beeping erratically,
suction gurgling)

11:42.803 --> 11:44.935
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING?

11:44.935 --> 11:46.737
WHAT DO WE GOT?

11:46.737 --> 11:47.808
I HAD TO OPEN HER UP. HER
PERICARDIUM IS FULL OF BLOOD.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.939
(Callie, normal voice)
TON OF CLOTS.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.010
GUNSHOT?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.842
NO, SHE HAD SPINAL FUSION
THREE DAYS AGO.

11:51.842 --> 11:53.013
WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.014
SHE HAS NO HISTORY OF
HEART DISEASE OR RISK FACTORS.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.015
THIS IS CRAZY.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.817
COULD IT BE
A RETROGRADE DISSECTION?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.819
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
SHE HAS NO HISTORY OF MARFAN'S

11:58.819 --> 11:59.850
OR AORTIC WIDENING ON X-RAY.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.021
(sighs)

12:01.021 --> 12:02.492
(beeping normalizes)

12:02.492 --> 12:03.754
(April) OH, HEAR HEART'S
BEATING AGAIN.

12:03.754 --> 12:04.825
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HER
UPSTAIRS NOW.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.826
THROW A STERILE TOWEL ON HER
AND MOVE.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.957
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.
LET'S GO.

12:06.957 --> 12:07.958
I DON'T NEED YOU
IN THERE. I'M GOOD.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.800
OKAY.
WELL, SHE'S MY PATIENT.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.902
DID YOU CUT HER HEART OPEN
IN YOUR SPINAL FUSION?

12:11.902 --> 12:13.503
UH,NO.
THEN SHE'S MY PATIENT.

12:13.503 --> 12:14.865
ALL RIGHT, HENRY'S IN C.T.

12:14.865 --> 12:16.837
SOMEBODY TELL WEBBER
WHERE I AM.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.909
OH, OH, OH, HOLD ON.

12:18.909 --> 12:19.970
(sighs)

12:19.970 --> 12:21.772
(elevator bell dings)

12:21.772 --> 12:23.944
(Richard) TEDDY!

12:27.918 --> 12:29.920
(Richard)
RIGHT THERE. THE BRONCHUS.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.922
JUDGING BY THE OSSIFICATION,
PROBABLY A CARDINOID TUMOR.

12:31.922 --> 12:33.824
BECAUSE OF
HIS TUMOR CONDITION?

12:33.824 --> 12:35.525
YEAH, HE'S BLEEDING
IN HIS LUNGS AND TRACHEA.

12:35.525 --> 12:36.887
LEXIE'S PREPPING HIM.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT OUT.

12:36.887 --> 12:37.928
YOU'RE GONNA BRONCH HIM
AND USE A LASER?

12:37.928 --> 12:38.989
I WAS PLANNING
TO OPEN HIM UP.

12:38.989 --> 12:40.791
TAKE OUT THE LUNG,
RESECT THE TUMOR,

12:40.791 --> 12:41.992
PUT IT BACK IN.
A LASER IS LESS INVASIVE

12:41.992 --> 12:43.864
AND THE RECOVERY TIME
IS MUCH FASTER.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.896
I HEAR THAT, BUT I'VE
NEVER DONE ONE WITH A LASER.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.869
WHAT?

12:48.869 --> 12:50.040
NOT FOR THIS KIND
OF PROCEDURE.

12:50.040 --> 12:52.803
AND I DON'T WANT MY FIRST ONE
TO BE ON YOUR HUSBAND.

12:52.803 --> 12:53.974
WELL, I...

12:53.974 --> 12:55.105
(sighs)

12:56.947 --> 12:58.879
UM...

13:00.911 --> 13:02.953
I THINK WE SHOULD
GET ANOTHER SURGEON.

13:13.223 --> 13:14.965
CRISTINA.
NO. COME ON.

13:14.965 --> 13:16.026
TAYLOR IS ON VACATION.

13:16.026 --> 13:17.167
GOLDMAN IS 45 MINUTES AWAY.

13:17.167 --> 13:19.169
I DID AN ENDOBRONCHIAL TUMOR
WITH CRISTINA LAST WEEK

13:19.169 --> 13:20.901
WITH A LASER.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.903
I BARELY DID A THING.
SHE DID IT ALL.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.174
WE'VE DONE THREE
IN THE LAST YEAR.

13:24.174 --> 13:26.076
TEDDY, IT--IT'S JUST
TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.939
NOW SHE'S A RESIDENT,
IT'S HER MENTOR'S HUSBAND.

13:28.939 --> 13:32.012
SHE'S A MACHINE. SHE DOESN'T
CARE IF IT'S MY HUSBAND.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.283
NO, SHE'S NOT,
AND WE CAN GET RUDZKI.

13:33.283 --> 13:35.916
RUDZKI'S AN ASS,
AND HE'S SLOPPY.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.047
GOWN.

13:37.047 --> 13:39.149
I THINK WE SHOULD RECONSIDER
HAVING WEBBER DO THIS.

13:39.149 --> 13:40.951
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO PROVE.

13:40.951 --> 13:43.153
IF I'M NOT STATE-OF-THE-ART,
HAVE YANG DO IT.

13:43.153 --> 13:44.955
THERE'S NO QUESTION,

13:44.955 --> 13:46.096
HENRY'S ON HIS FEET FASTER
IF WE DON'T OPEN HIM UP.

13:46.096 --> 13:47.958
CRISTINA DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW
THAT IT'S HENRY.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.229
DRAPE HIS FACE,
DON'T SHOW HER THE CHART,

13:49.229 --> 13:51.101
GIVE HER A VERBAL HISTORY.

13:51.101 --> 13:53.233
YOU PUT A BRONCHOSCOPE
AND A LASER IN HER HAND,

13:53.233 --> 13:55.035
SHE'S NOT GONNA ASK

13:55.035 --> 13:57.938
FOR THE GUY'S NAME
AND, UH, A FAMILY PHOTO.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.069
SHE IS GONNA CUT.

13:59.069 --> 14:01.011
(lowered voice) YOU REALLY
THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

14:01.011 --> 14:02.142
LOOK, I'LL BE THERE
THE WHOLE TIME.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.273
IF SHE HAS TROUBLE,

14:03.273 --> 14:05.946
I'LL GO IN AND OPEN HIM UP
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.217
LAP SPONGES, PLEASE.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.119
OWEN? IS HE SCOWLING?

14:09.119 --> 14:10.951
YEAH. SO AM I.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.152
I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER.

14:12.152 --> 14:13.954
FRANKLY, THE ONLY THING
THAT I'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH

14:13.954 --> 14:15.085
IS DOING IT MYSELF.

14:15.085 --> 14:17.027
BUT SINCE WE ALL KNOW THAT
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

14:17.027 --> 14:19.029
THE NEXT CLOSEST THING IS YANG.

14:19.029 --> 14:21.031
SHE IS THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL
DO IT THE WAY I WOULD.

14:25.966 --> 14:26.997
FINE.

14:26.997 --> 14:28.098
WHAT'D HE SAY?

14:28.098 --> 14:29.169
(Richard)
UH, HE SAID FINE.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.170
THANK YOU.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.102
RICHARD, WATCH HER LIKE A HAWK.

14:32.102 --> 14:33.243
IF SHE SCREWS THIS UP,

14:33.243 --> 14:35.045
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE OUT
HALF HIS LUNG.

14:35.045 --> 14:36.246
AND THE LAST THING I NEED IS TO
HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO MY HUSBAND

14:36.246 --> 14:37.307
WHY THAT HAPPENED.

14:37.307 --> 14:38.308
I'LL WATCH HER.

14:38.308 --> 14:40.080
CAUTERY. KEEP SUCTIONING.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.081
YOU GOTTA GET
SOME OF THOSE CLOTS OUT.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.182
OKAY.
GOOD.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.355
(siren whoops)

14:45.355 --> 14:47.257
HEY, WE'RE HERE TO PICK UP
A NEWBORN,

14:47.257 --> 14:49.059
TAKE HER TO SEATTLE GRACE.

14:49.059 --> 14:50.190
YOU'RE, UH,
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.222
I'M JORDAN WAGNER. I AM
REALLY GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS.

14:52.222 --> 14:54.194
YEAH, I'M ALEX KAREV.
MEREDITH GREY.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.097
OKAY. LI--UH, LISTEN, SHE WAS
BORN SIX HOURS AGO,

14:57.097 --> 14:58.368
RIGHT AWAY, TROUBLE BREATHING.

14:58.368 --> 15:01.201
STOMACH LOOKED DISTENDED,
SO WE PUT DOWN AN N.G. TUBE.

15:01.201 --> 15:04.074
BUT THE X-RAY SHOWED THAT IT WAS
JUST COILING IN HER CHEST.

15:04.074 --> 15:05.275
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO KEEP HER BREATHING,

15:05.275 --> 15:06.276
BUT IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE.

15:06.276 --> 15:08.008
YOU DON'T HAVE
A NEONATAL MASK?

15:08.008 --> 15:10.380
WE'RE NOT SET UP FOR NEONATAL
OR O.B.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.182
SHE WAS AN EMERGENCY DELIVERY,

15:12.182 --> 15:14.014
OTHERWISE, WE WOULD'VE SENT HER
TO THE HOSPITAL IN LEAVENWORTH.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.216
PULSE OX IS 79.
RESPIRATORY RATE IS 80.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.387
SHE'S GOT RETRACTIONS.

15:17.387 --> 15:19.019
HOW COME SHE'S NOT INTUBATED?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.120
THE SMALLEST TUBE WE HAD
DIDN'T FIT.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.351
PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOU
BROUGHT A NEONATAL TUBE.

15:21.351 --> 15:25.055
WE'RE GONNA NEED X-RAY IN HERE
FOR A POST-INTUBATION FILM.

15:25.055 --> 15:26.226
THIS I.V.'s NO GOOD.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.398
YEAH, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
A NEONATAL CENTRAL LINE KIT.

15:28.398 --> 15:29.399
NO.

15:29.399 --> 15:31.161
I.O. NEEDLE?

15:31.161 --> 15:33.233
NO.

15:41.171 --> 15:43.213
(Owen) YOU WILL NOT CALL
DR. YANG INTO THE O.R.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.345
UNTIL HENRY IS INTUBATED
AND DRAPED.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.347
YOU WILL MAKE SURE TO DRAPE
EVERY INCH OF HIS FACE.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.179
YOU WILL GIVE
A VERBAL HISTORY,

15:49.179 --> 15:51.051
AND YOU WILL SIMPLY
OMIT THE PATIENT'S NAME.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.282
BUT DR. WEBBER'S
GONNA BE IN THERE?

15:52.282 --> 15:54.084
YES.
AND HE KNOWS?

15:54.084 --> 15:56.086
HE KNOWS, YOU KNOW.
DR. YANG DOES NOT.

15:56.086 --> 15:57.327
CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?

15:59.229 --> 16:00.390
YOU SURE?

16:00.390 --> 16:02.362
YEAH. I-I MEAN, I'M GONNA
BE WEARING A MASK, RIGHT?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.165
I MEAN, AS LONG AS I DON'T
START GIGGLING THEN WE'RE--

16:05.165 --> 16:06.266
WE'RE FINE.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.438
MM-HMM.

16:11.101 --> 16:14.104
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

16:18.078 --> 16:19.209
SHE DOESN'T WANT
ANY KIDS AT ALL?

16:19.209 --> 16:21.351
ZOLA WAS HER BABY. SHE DOESN'T
WANT ANOTHER BABY.

16:21.351 --> 16:24.114
AH, SHE'LL COME AROUND.
SHE'S UPSET. GIVE HER SOME TIME.

16:24.114 --> 16:25.385
I DON'T KNOW.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.217
LOOK, IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,
YOU CAN ALWAYS SHARE SOFIA.

16:27.217 --> 16:29.319
THERE'S THREE OF US PARENTING
HER ALREADY. IT KINDA WORKS.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.421
NO ONE GETS TOO EXHAUSTED,
YOU'RE NOT ON VERY NIGHT.

16:31.421 --> 16:34.164
WE CAN WORK YOU
INTO THE ROTATION.

16:34.164 --> 16:36.226
SHE'S A BABY. SHE'S NOT
A TIME-SHARE IN CABO.

16:36.226 --> 16:37.327
YOU'RE CLOSE-MINDED.
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

16:37.327 --> 16:38.368
THAT'S MY PROBLEM?

16:38.368 --> 16:40.370
AVERY.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.232
(claps hands)
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

16:42.232 --> 16:43.303
NOSE IS HANGING OFF
AND A LOT OF SOFT TISSUE LOSS.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.474
PROBABLY NERVE DAMAGE.

16:44.474 --> 16:46.336
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
DR. ROBBINS IS READY FOR YOU.

16:46.336 --> 16:49.239
(suction gurgling)

16:49.239 --> 16:50.410
IT'S KAREV.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.282
HOW'S IT GOING?

16:52.282 --> 16:53.483
THE KID'S SEPTIC.
SHE'S GOT PNEUMONIA.

16:53.483 --> 16:55.345
Was she intubated
when you got there?

16:55.345 --> 16:58.218
YEAH, WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY NEONATAL STUFF HERE AT ALL.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.390
We intubated, we started
an umbilical line

17:00.390 --> 17:03.223
TO HANG D10 NORMAL SALINE
AND ANTIBIOTICS.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.424
BUT HER SATs AREN'T COMING UP,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.356
AND ALL THE OXYGEN'S
GOING INTO HER STOMACH.

17:06.356 --> 17:08.158
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT IN
AN AMPLATZ UMBRELLA.

17:08.158 --> 17:09.299
THEY DON'T HAVE
A 3-0 E.T. TUBE.

17:09.299 --> 17:10.460
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
AN AMPLATZ?

17:10.460 --> 17:12.132
ALL RIGHT.
ELEVATE HER HEAD.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.233
ALL RIGHT.
GET HER HEAD UP.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.234
All right, do they have
a Fogarty catheter?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.235
They use those on grown-ups.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.506
A FOGARTY CATHETER?

17:16.506 --> 17:18.468
YEAH, WHAT ELSE?
You're gonna have to

17:18.468 --> 17:20.510
THREAD THE FOGARTY DOWN
HER TRACHEA, PRETTY FAR DOWN,

17:20.510 --> 17:22.172
then blow up the balloon,

17:22.172 --> 17:23.273
and pull up until
you get traction.

17:23.273 --> 17:24.314
THAT'LL OCCLUDE THE FISTULA

17:24.314 --> 17:25.475
AND GET THE AIR
FLOWING INTO THE LUNGS.

17:25.475 --> 17:26.476
You're gonna have to keep
the blind pouch clear

17:26.476 --> 17:27.477
on your way back.

17:27.477 --> 17:29.179
AND I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE

17:29.179 --> 17:30.280
ANYTHING IN YOUR BOX
THAT'S GONNA DO THAT.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.521
UH, HOW ABOUT AN 8 FRENCH
SUCTION CATHETER?

17:31.521 --> 17:33.223
Yeah, that'll work.

17:33.223 --> 17:34.484
GOT IT. ALL RIGHT.

17:34.484 --> 17:36.426
WE'RE GONNA CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET TO RIG.
Hey, Alex.

17:36.426 --> 17:38.228
YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

17:38.228 --> 17:39.229
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

17:39.229 --> 17:40.390
(cell phone beeps)

17:42.462 --> 17:45.335
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:45.335 --> 17:47.197
LOOK AT THAT.

17:47.197 --> 17:50.300
THERE'S A HUGE TEAR
IN THE LEFT VENTRICLE.
CAN YOU REPAIR IT?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.272
NO, IT'S TOO BIG. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO ON BYPASS.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.543
(woman) DR. ALTMAN,
I'VE GOT YOUR HUSBAND.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.545
OH, GOOD. HENRY.

17:55.545 --> 17:56.546
HEY, BABE.

17:56.546 --> 17:58.278
I am so sorry.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.250
This woman's heart is spouting
like a fountain

18:00.250 --> 18:01.311
for no apparent reason.

18:01.311 --> 18:02.482
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.414
WELL, IF THERE WAS ANY WAY I
COULD GET OUT OF HERE, I WOULD.

18:04.414 --> 18:05.485
Stop worrying about it.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.288
YOU CAN HOLD MY HAND...
IN POST-OP.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.489
YOU WERE SUCH A WUSS
BEFORE MY LAST SURGERY,

18:09.489 --> 18:11.291
IT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD THING ANYWAY.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.223
YEAH, THAT WASN'T
MY BEST WORK.

18:13.223 --> 18:14.464
WE'RE AN OLD
MARRIED COUPLE NOW.

18:14.464 --> 18:17.297
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DRIVE ME TO THE AIRPORT.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.529
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WALK ME
TO THE O.R.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.271
WELL, I STILL WANT RIDES
TO THE AIRPORT.

18:21.271 --> 18:22.472
That's 'cause you're
high maintenance.

18:22.472 --> 18:24.304
(singsongy) YOU KNOW IT.
(coughs)

18:24.304 --> 18:27.307
(exhales) LOOK, I'LL, UH,
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER.

18:27.307 --> 18:28.578
(normal voice) HENRY,
DON'T ASK FOR EXTRA MORPHINE

18:28.578 --> 18:30.540
JUST 'CAUSE YOU LIKE
THE DREAMS.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.282
(coughs) Get back to work.
LOVE YOU.

18:32.282 --> 18:34.314
YEAH, YOU, TOO.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.445
(cell phone beeps)

18:35.445 --> 18:37.547
ALL RIGHT. I'M GOOD.
MORE SPONGES, PLEASE.

18:37.547 --> 18:40.290
WOW. THERE AREN'T
ENOUGH SPONGES IN THE WORLD.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.291
SUCTION.

18:41.291 --> 18:42.352
(suction gurgles)

18:42.352 --> 18:43.423
(beeps)

18:43.423 --> 18:45.355
MUST BE HARD FOR HER
TO BE IN THE O.R.

18:45.355 --> 18:48.358
AND NOT HERE WITH YOU.

18:48.358 --> 18:51.361
(exhales deeply)

18:51.361 --> 18:53.333
CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
KIND OF EMBARRASSING?

18:53.333 --> 18:54.434
YEAH.

18:54.434 --> 18:58.238
I WANT TO GO TO MED SCHOOL.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.409
THAT'S NOT EMBARRASSING.

18:59.409 --> 19:00.570
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY BE
THE YOUNGEST KID IN MY CLASS.

19:00.570 --> 19:02.372
YEAH, BUT YOU'LL BE MATURE.

19:02.372 --> 19:03.573
YOU'LL HAVE PERSPECTIVE.
(chuckles)

19:03.573 --> 19:05.575
NONE OF US HAD THAT
IN OUR CLASS.

19:05.575 --> 19:08.248
TEDDY'S NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THE IDEA.

19:08.248 --> 19:10.280
WE KINDA HAD A...

19:10.280 --> 19:12.322
A BIG FIGHT ABOUT IT
RIGHT BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED.

19:12.322 --> 19:14.454
WELL, SHE MIGHT NEED SOME TIME
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA.

19:14.454 --> 19:17.257
NONE OF THIS IS VERY EASY
ON RELATIONSHIPS.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.458
YOU SEEM TO DO OKAY.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.360
JACKSON, RIGHT?
HE'S--HE'S GREAT.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.263
YEAH. THOUGH WE'RE NOT
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.595
OH. UM... MARK SLOAN?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.568
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER EITHER.

19:34.544 --> 19:36.546
SO WHO'S--WHO'S GONNA BE
OPERATING ON ME--

19:36.546 --> 19:38.578
DR. WEBBER?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.280
I DON'T KNOW.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.553
(clicks keyboard key)

19:46.486 --> 19:48.618
HEY. TEDDY'S GOT A PATIENT
WITH AN ENDOBRONCHIAL CARCINOID.

19:48.618 --> 19:50.620
SHE WANTS YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.392
NOW?
YES.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.623
WHY CAN'T SHE DO IT HERSELF?

19:53.623 --> 19:56.466
WELL, SHE'S WORKING ON A WOMAN
WHO ALMOST BLED OUT IN THE E.R.

19:56.466 --> 19:58.468
SO, UH, SHE CAN'T DO IT.

19:58.468 --> 20:00.300
WELL, HOW ABOUT GOLDMAN?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.501
(sighs)

20:01.501 --> 20:04.374
SHE'S GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO
FLY SOLO ON A MAJOR PROCEDURE.

20:04.374 --> 20:07.337
I KNOW, BUT WE JUST DID
A SIMILAR ONE.

20:07.337 --> 20:08.508
I BASICALLY HANDLED
THE WHOLE THING MYSELF

20:08.508 --> 20:10.380
WHILE SHE PLANNED THE MENU
FOR WHAT SOUNDED LIKE

20:10.380 --> 20:11.581
A REALLY BORING BRUNCH.

20:11.581 --> 20:13.443
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO DO MY FIRST
BENTALL PROCEDURE TOMORROW.

20:13.443 --> 20:14.584
IT'S FROM MY BUCKET LIST.

20:14.584 --> 20:16.386
I'M PRACTICING THE STEPS.
YOU WANT TO SEE?

20:16.386 --> 20:19.389
OKAY, DROP THE DAMN SUTURE
AND GO SCRUB. ALL RIGHT?

20:19.389 --> 20:21.321
OKAY. RELAX.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.452
(instrument clatters)

20:22.452 --> 20:24.524
THIS BETTER BE FAST.
I WANT TO BE FRESH TOMORROW.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.625
CRISTINA, THIS IS EMERGENT.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.327
YEAH, I'M GOING.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.498
I'M JUST SAYING, I'M GLAD
SHE LIKES ME,

20:28.498 --> 20:30.400
BUT IF SHE'S GONNA CALL ME
EVERY TIME SHE HAS

20:30.400 --> 20:32.332
A PROCEDURE
SHE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE DOING...

20:32.332 --> 20:33.663
I MEAN, I'M NOT HER VALET.

20:43.012 --> 20:45.244
(siren wailing)

20:45.244 --> 20:48.247
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

20:51.781 --> 20:54.824
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE END.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.726
YOU'LL CALL THE LAWYERS
IN THE MORNING.

20:56.726 --> 20:58.257
AND M-MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE YOU GUYS CAN DO.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.859
MEREDITH DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

20:59.859 --> 21:03.032
I PUSHED HER.
SHE OPENED HERSELF UP.

21:03.032 --> 21:05.865
NOW I FEEL LIKE I...

21:05.865 --> 21:06.996
I DID THIS TO HER.

21:06.996 --> 21:08.998
SHE WANTED IT, TOO,

21:08.998 --> 21:10.870
OR IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.872
SHE'LL BLAME ME...

21:12.872 --> 21:15.845
LIKE I'VE BEEN BLAMING HER.

21:15.845 --> 21:17.877
WE LOST ZOLA,
AND NOW IF I LOSE MEREDITH...

21:17.877 --> 21:19.278
SHE ALWAYS COMES BACK.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.812
SHE MIGHT NEED A MINUTE
TO BACK AWAY, BUT...

21:22.812 --> 21:24.814
SHE COMES BACK.

21:32.061 --> 21:34.764
TRY THIS PATCH ON THE TEAR.

21:34.764 --> 21:36.766
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CUT IT TO SIZE.

21:36.766 --> 21:37.897
AH, HANG ON.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.830
SORRY. I--MY GLOVE IS STUCK
ON SOMETHING.

21:40.830 --> 21:42.772
I'M TAKING MY HAND OUT.

21:42.772 --> 21:44.874
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:44.874 --> 21:46.336
THERE'S A HOLE IN MY GLOVE.

21:46.336 --> 21:47.937
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:47.937 --> 21:49.979
CAN WE GET DR. KEPNER
A NEW GLOVE, PLEASE?

21:49.979 --> 21:51.310
(glove snaps)

21:51.310 --> 21:53.783
DID IT BREAK THE SKIN?

21:53.783 --> 21:54.984
NO. I THINK I'M FINE.

21:54.984 --> 21:56.886
(woman) HERE YOU GO.
THANKS.

21:56.886 --> 21:59.919
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:59.919 --> 22:01.320
MY GOD.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.993
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

22:03.993 --> 22:05.925
(turns water off)

22:06.996 --> 22:08.798
(door hisses open)

22:08.798 --> 22:11.861
DR. YANG.

22:11.861 --> 22:13.102
WE JUST STARTED
THE BRONCHOSCOPY.

22:13.102 --> 22:14.964
LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING YOUR WORK.

22:14.964 --> 22:16.065
HOPEFULLY I'LL LEARN
A THING OR TWO.

22:16.065 --> 22:17.336
IT'S AN HONOR, SIR.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.908
UH, 35-YEAR-OLD MALE,

22:18.908 --> 22:20.109
ENDOBRONCHIAL CARCINOID TUMOR,

22:20.109 --> 22:22.872
PRESENTED WITH
ACTIVE HEMOPTYSIS.

22:22.872 --> 22:26.846
HE'S BEEN GIVEN TWO LITERS L.R.
AND A UNIT OF PACKED CELLS.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.877
OKAY.

22:27.877 --> 22:30.079
SO WE'LL RESECT
WITH THE C-O-2 LASER.

22:30.079 --> 22:31.921
IS IT READY TO GO?

22:31.921 --> 22:33.052
YES.

22:33.052 --> 22:36.025
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GONNA TIME MYSELF.

22:36.025 --> 22:37.827
LAST TIME I DID THIS,
IT TOOK ME LIKE

22:37.827 --> 22:39.088
TWO AND A HALF HOURS,
SKIN TO SKIN.

22:39.088 --> 22:40.830
THAT'S TOO LONG.

22:40.830 --> 22:41.931
I THINK I GET HYPNOTIZED, UM,

22:41.931 --> 22:43.362
WHEN I WATCH THAT LASER
OR SOMETHING.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.994
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET IT
DOWN TO, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

22:44.994 --> 22:46.936
LET'S START THE TIMER
FOR DR. YANG.

22:46.936 --> 22:48.838
OKAY, LASER, PLEASE.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.404
(thunder rumbling)

22:56.406 --> 22:58.047
IS THAT THEM?

22:58.047 --> 23:00.379
WAIT. I'M COMING WITH YOU.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.951
DANA?

23:01.951 --> 23:04.113
WHY IS SHE OUT HERE?

23:04.113 --> 23:05.955
SHE SAID IF I DIDN'T
TAKE HER, SHE'D WALK.

23:05.955 --> 23:07.987
I WAS AFRAID SHE'D TRY IT.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.989
PLEASE LET ME COME WITH HER.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.121
DANA...
YOU JUST HAD SURGERY,

23:12.121 --> 23:13.993
AND YOU'VE
LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.965
I'LL BE FINE. PLEASE.

23:15.965 --> 23:17.967
I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

23:17.967 --> 23:19.869
THESE GUYS,
THEY'RE THE BEST.

23:19.869 --> 23:22.101
SHE IS IN GREAT HANDS.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.033
(crying)

23:24.033 --> 23:25.404
PLEASE.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.106
SHE'S MY BABY.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.978
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER.

23:28.978 --> 23:31.941
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.
SHE'S SO LITTLE.
(thunder rumbling)

23:31.941 --> 23:33.412
PLEASE.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.915
I HAVE TO BE WITH HER.
PLEASE LET ME GO WITH HER.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.416
I'M DR. GREY.
AND THAT'S DR. KAREV.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.088
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE
YOUR DAUGHTER

23:39.088 --> 23:41.090
TO THE BEST BABY SURGEON
THERE IS.

23:41.090 --> 23:43.953
SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE
A NAME YET.

23:43.953 --> 23:45.194
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GIVE HER ONE
WHEN YOU COME TO SEATTLE

23:45.194 --> 23:46.926
AND HOLD HER IN YOUR ARMS.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.128
AND UNTIL THAT TIME,
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.

23:49.128 --> 23:52.431
YOU HEAR ME?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.433
I HAVE HER.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.905
OKAY?

23:55.905 --> 23:58.908
(rain falling)

24:09.178 --> 24:11.050
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:11.050 --> 24:13.122
SHOW HER THE TRAY.

24:13.122 --> 24:15.154
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:15.154 --> 24:16.486
THAT'S THE SCREW

24:16.486 --> 24:19.228
THAT I JUST PULLED
OUT OFYOURPATIENT.

24:19.228 --> 24:22.061
IT WAS STABBING HER HEART,
SLICING INTO CARDIAC MUSCLE

24:22.061 --> 24:24.063
EVERY TIME
THE HEART TRIED TO BEAT.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.035
THIS THING LOOKS LIKE
HAMBURGER MEAT RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

24:26.035 --> 24:27.136
OH, MY GOD.

24:27.136 --> 24:29.098
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW THIS HAPPENED?

24:29.098 --> 24:32.241
(beeping continues)

24:32.241 --> 24:35.174
(siren wailing)

24:35.174 --> 24:38.207
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

24:40.079 --> 24:42.081
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT TRY
ADOPTION AGAIN?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.013
SOCIAL SERVICES
JUST TOOK OUR KID AWAY.

24:44.013 --> 24:46.215
WHAT DO YOU THINK, IF WE WAIT
A WEEK, THEY'LL FORGET

24:46.215 --> 24:48.087
AND GIVE US ANOTHER TRY
WITH A NEW KID?

24:48.087 --> 24:49.158
ALL RIGHT.
SO GET A SURROGATE.

24:49.158 --> 24:50.159
(sighs) ALEX.

24:50.159 --> 24:51.220
WHY NOT?

24:51.220 --> 24:53.092
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
A SURROGATE.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.964
OKAY? JUST DROP IT.

24:54.964 --> 24:56.165
NO. YOU JUST DON'T
GIVE UP LIKE THAT.

24:56.165 --> 24:57.226
IT'S NICE THAT YOU CARE,

24:57.226 --> 24:59.228
BUT IT REALLY ISN'T
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:59.228 --> 25:01.070
IT IS. IT'S MY FAULT.

25:01.070 --> 25:04.033
I CAN'T HANDLE BEING RESPONSIBLE
FOR YOU NOT HAVING KIDS.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.104
IT'S TOO MUCH.

25:05.104 --> 25:07.106
I--IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.138
YEAH, IT IS.

25:10.279 --> 25:12.111
NO, IT'S MY FAULT.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.014
I GOT THE BALL ROLLING.
I MESSED WITH THE TRIAL.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.186
WHAT YOU DID WAS TURDY,
BUT WHAT I DID WAS ILLEGAL.

25:17.186 --> 25:18.517
WHO CARES?
YOU JUST DON'T GIVE UP.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.119
IT'S LAME.
YOU'RE NOT A QUITTER.

25:20.119 --> 25:22.151
THAT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.

25:22.151 --> 25:24.023
(creaking, engine sputtering)

25:24.023 --> 25:25.094
(brakes squeak)

25:25.094 --> 25:28.998
(tires squealing)

25:28.998 --> 25:30.199
DUDE, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

25:30.199 --> 25:33.532
(beeping continues)

25:33.532 --> 25:36.205
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SURGERY.

25:36.205 --> 25:38.207
NO, HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE
IN THE MIDDLE OF.

25:38.207 --> 25:40.039
THE SURGERY ON LAURA LEWIS,

25:40.039 --> 25:42.011
WHERE I SUPERVISED YOU
INSERTING PEDICLE SCREWS

25:42.011 --> 25:43.212
AND A PLATE TO STABILIZE
T-6 TO T-8?

25:43.212 --> 25:44.273
YEAH?

25:44.273 --> 25:46.075
ONE OF THEM'S STABBING HER
IN THE HEART.

25:46.075 --> 25:47.546
SHE'S HALF DEAD,

25:47.546 --> 25:50.149
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO
TELL HER HUSBAND.

25:56.586 --> 25:59.058
SO USING A LASER'S
NOT MUCH DIFFERENT

25:59.058 --> 26:01.591
THAN A NORMAL
BRONCHOSCOPIC RESECTION?

26:01.591 --> 26:03.092
(Cristina) UH, YES.

26:03.092 --> 26:04.293
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE
EXTRA CAREFUL

26:04.293 --> 26:05.595
WITH HIDDEN
VASCULAR STRUCTURES

26:05.595 --> 26:08.137
WHEN USING
THIS HIGH A LEVEL OF ENERGY.

26:08.137 --> 26:10.199
(Richard) BUT YOU'RE FORMING
AN ESCHAR AS YOU GO,

26:10.199 --> 26:11.601
SO THE BLOOD'S COAGULATING
ALONG THE WAY.

26:11.601 --> 26:12.602
PRETTY MUCH.

26:12.602 --> 26:14.043
THAT IS PRETTY HAND.

26:14.043 --> 26:16.345
OH, OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

26:16.345 --> 26:19.278
UGH. I MUST HAVE NICKED
A VESSEL.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.150
(monitor beeping erratically)

26:21.150 --> 26:22.211
PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

26:22.211 --> 26:24.083
OKAY, SO I'M GIVING IT
MORE IRRIGATION.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.254
AH, THE WHOLE FIELD'S OBSCURED.

26:25.254 --> 26:27.617
(beeping continues)

26:27.617 --> 26:29.258
(door opens)

26:29.258 --> 26:31.621
(lightning crackles)

26:36.225 --> 26:37.296
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ENGINE?

26:37.296 --> 26:38.367
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE CRAP IT IS.

26:38.367 --> 26:40.099
I CALLED FOR ANOTHER UNIT,

26:40.099 --> 26:41.100
BUT WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.231
IT'S GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

26:42.231 --> 26:43.602
I'M PUTTING THESE OUT
AND I'M GONNA RUN BACK.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.104
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS
A STORE OR SOMETHING

26:45.104 --> 26:46.235
ABOUT HALF A MILE BACK.

26:46.235 --> 26:48.237
MAYBE THEY GOT A TRUCK.
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF THE RIG.

26:48.237 --> 26:49.639
IT'S POURING RAIN
AND FREEZING.

26:49.639 --> 26:51.240
WE CAN'T GO OUT THERE
WITH THE BABY.

26:51.240 --> 26:52.611
THERE'S NO SHOULDER.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.183
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN JUST
TAKE THE INCUBATOR OUT.

26:54.183 --> 26:55.384
I MEAN, THERE'S NOT EVEN
ANYWHERE TO STAND.

26:55.384 --> 26:57.116
THIS THING
IS FULL OF OXYGEN TANKS.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.317
WE GET HIT, IT'LL GO UP
LIKE A ROMAN CANDLE.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.089
YOU GOTTA GET OUT.

27:00.089 --> 27:01.390
AND LEAVE THE BABY?
SHE'LL DIE.

27:01.390 --> 27:03.192
YOU WANT TO ALL DIE?
I'M PUTTING THESE OUT.

27:03.192 --> 27:04.393
YOU BETTER HOPE
PEOPLE CAN SEE 'EM.

27:04.393 --> 27:06.355
YOU'RE ON A HILL
AND YOU'RE ON A CURVE.

27:06.355 --> 27:09.098
I'M TELLING YOU,
GET OUT THE DAMN RIG.

27:09.098 --> 27:10.199
(door closes)

27:21.340 --> 27:23.042
HEY, YOU NEED SOME HELP?

27:23.042 --> 27:24.113
WHY?

27:24.113 --> 27:25.374
WELL, HIS PRESSURE
DROPPED OUT.

27:25.374 --> 27:27.376
OH, THERE WAS A NICK
IN AN ARTERY.

27:27.376 --> 27:29.318
I CAUTERIZED, AND HIS PRESSURE
CAME BACK UP.

27:29.318 --> 27:33.022
OKAY, BUT WHAT IF IT WAS
A CARCINOID CRISIS?

27:33.022 --> 27:34.383
UH, I DOUBT IT.

27:34.383 --> 27:36.355
BUT IF HIS PRESSURE
DROPS OUT AGAIN,

27:36.355 --> 27:37.356
I'LL THINK ABOUT A DOSE
OF OCTREOTIDE.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.058
CRISTINA--

27:39.058 --> 27:40.259
I'M ON A CLOCK,
AND YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.360
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

27:41.360 --> 27:44.063
CRISTINA, THERE'S A PATIENT
ON THE TABLE.

27:44.063 --> 27:47.096
LET GO OF THE CLOCK
AND FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

27:47.096 --> 27:48.197
I AM FOCUSED.

27:48.197 --> 27:50.399
I'D FOCUS A WHOLE LOT BETTER

27:50.399 --> 27:53.302
IF YOU WEREN'T STANDING HERE
WITH YOUR PANTS ON FIRE.

27:55.104 --> 27:57.076
WE'VE GOT IT, DR. HUNT.

28:04.153 --> 28:05.284
APPARENTLY,
ONE OF THE SCREWS

28:05.284 --> 28:07.086
WE PLACED IN HER SPINE
CAME LOOSE.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.287
UH, IT COULD BE THAT THE BONE
ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH

28:08.287 --> 28:09.358
TO HOLD THE SCREW.

28:09.358 --> 28:11.290
BUT AT THIS POINT,
WE DON'T KNOW.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.392
OKAY, AND SO WHAT,
IT JUST, UM,

28:13.392 --> 28:15.224
AND SO THE SCREW, IT--

28:15.224 --> 28:16.395
IT CUT INTO HER HEART?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.367
DR. ALTMAN'S REPAIRING
HER HEART RIGHT NOW,

28:18.367 --> 28:20.299
AND SHE'S
AN INCREDIBLE SURGEON.

28:20.299 --> 28:23.132
BUT, UH, WE WON'T KNOW
FOR A WHILE

28:23.132 --> 28:25.334
EXACTLY WHAT THE SITUATION IS.

28:25.334 --> 28:29.208
SITUATION? I--BUT I--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.239
WHERE'S MY MAMA?

28:32.381 --> 28:34.183
OH, BUDDY.

28:34.183 --> 28:36.445
BUDDY. COME HERE.

28:42.391 --> 28:44.153
(door hisses open)

28:50.429 --> 28:52.131
(Richard)
LOOK AT THAT.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.262
VERY NICE.

28:53.262 --> 28:54.403
RIGHT?

28:54.403 --> 28:57.166
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.408
OH, HANG ON.
WE'VE GOT SOME BLEEDING.

28:59.408 --> 29:02.141
OKAY, YOU HAVE SOME CLOTS
BLOCKING YOUR SCOPE.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.212
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OUT
YOUR LASER

29:03.212 --> 29:04.273
AND PASS A BRUSH
THROUGH IT?

29:04.273 --> 29:06.275
OKAY. OKAY.

29:06.275 --> 29:08.117
SATs ARE DOWN
TO 88.

29:08.117 --> 29:09.178
(monitor beeping erratically)

29:09.178 --> 29:10.319
OKAY, UH, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO OPEN HIM UP.

29:10.319 --> 29:12.151
JUST LET ME
JUST TRY THIS FIRST.

29:12.151 --> 29:15.124
YANG, YANG, YOU HAVE BLOOD
COMING IN THROUGH THE E.T. TUBE.

29:15.124 --> 29:16.125
GET OUTTA THERE.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.256
I CAN CLEAR THE FIELD--

29:17.256 --> 29:19.258
GET HIS CHEST READY,
GREY. WE'RE GOING IN.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.429
OKAY, OKAY,
I'M PULLING OUT.

29:20.429 --> 29:24.393
(beeping continues)

29:31.170 --> 29:32.241
10-BLADE.

29:32.241 --> 29:34.403
(woman) 10-BLADE.

29:40.249 --> 29:42.281
(lowered voice) FIND ALL
THE FILMS--PRE-OP, POST-OP.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.483
YOU GO OVER EVERY INCH
OF EVERY IMAGE

29:44.483 --> 29:46.385
AND ASSUMING SHE SURVIVES,
YOU GET A C.T.

29:46.385 --> 29:47.456
TO CHECK THE HARDWARE

29:47.456 --> 29:49.188
AND RUN A BONE DENSITY TEST...
(pager beeps)

29:49.188 --> 29:51.360
SO WE CAN GET A CLUE AS TO
WHAT THE HELL WENT WRONG.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.262
OH. I, UH...

29:53.262 --> 29:54.523
I'M SO SORRY.
I-I HAVE TO GO, DR TORRES.

29:54.523 --> 29:55.524
I'M SORRY.

29:55.524 --> 29:57.226
(gasps)

29:57.226 --> 29:58.367
WHAT?

29:58.367 --> 30:01.200
AVERY PUT PEDICLE SCREWS

30:01.200 --> 30:02.401
IN A WOMAN'S SPINE THIS WEEK,

30:02.401 --> 30:03.502
AND ONE OF THEM
TURNED OUT TO BE

30:03.502 --> 30:05.234
TEARING HOLES IN
HER LEFT VENTRICLE.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.305
WHOA.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.406
(exhales) I CAN'T--

30:07.406 --> 30:08.507
I C--I CAN'T--
I CAN'T EVEN BREATHE RIGHT NOW.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.279
YEAH, WELL, COME ON.
IT'S PART OF THE DEAL.

30:10.279 --> 30:12.211
WE HAVE TO
LET STUDENTS OPERATE.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.512
THEY DON'T ALWAYS
GET IT RIGHT.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.345
I WAS READING A MAGAZINE.

30:16.345 --> 30:18.487
HEY, COME ON.

30:18.487 --> 30:20.389
NOW DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.
WE ALL DO IT.

30:20.389 --> 30:22.321
I KNOW WHAT J.Lo WORE
TO THE COFFEEHOUSE.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.552
THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

30:23.552 --> 30:25.394
SHH.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.228
(monitor beeping erratically)

30:29.228 --> 30:30.229
VASCULAR CLAMP.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.230
HE IS LOSING
WAY TOO MUCH BLOOD

30:31.230 --> 30:32.261
WAY TOO FAST.

30:32.261 --> 30:33.462
OKAY, PUT THE BLOOD
ON A RAPID INFUSER

30:33.462 --> 30:35.534
AND GET ME
ANOTHER TWO UNITS UP HERE.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.236
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.
HE'S REALLY BRADYCARDIC.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.338
(Richard) OKAY, LET'S PUSH
ONE ATROPINE. NOW.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.240
UH, HOLD ON.
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.212
THIS TUMOR HAS ERODED

30:43.212 --> 30:44.443
RIGHT THROUGH
THE PULMONARY ARTERY.

30:44.443 --> 30:45.444
(beeping continues)

30:45.444 --> 30:46.515
DAMN IT.

30:46.515 --> 30:48.217
LET ME SEE.

30:48.217 --> 30:49.278
(beeping continues)

30:49.278 --> 30:50.279
SIR...

30:50.279 --> 30:53.382
(suction gurgling)

30:53.382 --> 30:55.384
OKAY. LET'S CLAMP
THE HILUM.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.487
UH, HE'S ALREADY LOST
HALF HIS BLOOD VOLUME.

30:58.487 --> 31:00.259
THIS LUNG
IS LIKE A SIEVE.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.430
I--
GIVE ME BOVIE. (clears throat)

31:01.430 --> 31:04.233
WE'RE MAXED OUT ON DOPAMINE.
MAXED OUT ON NOREPI.

31:04.233 --> 31:07.366
SIR, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT WE DO NEXT.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.367
V-FIB.
(monitor beeping rapidly)

31:08.367 --> 31:10.439
OKAY, PUSH ONE OF EPI. NOW.

31:10.439 --> 31:11.540
I'M GONNA START COMPRESSIONS.

31:11.540 --> 31:13.602
AH--
LET'S GET THIS OUTTA HERE.

31:13.602 --> 31:15.374
COME ON, PEOPLE.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.446
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

31:17.446 --> 31:20.449
(beeping continues)

31:25.454 --> 31:27.286
COME ON.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.487
(beeping continues)

31:32.291 --> 31:33.622
LOOK AT THAT.

31:33.622 --> 31:36.325
HIS NOSE
IS GONNA BE PERFECT.

31:36.325 --> 31:37.326
THIS IS GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL.

31:37.326 --> 31:38.467
IF YOU DO
SAY SO YOURSELF.

31:38.467 --> 31:40.329
(Arizona chuckles)

31:40.329 --> 31:42.501
I OFFERED TO TIME-SHARE SOFIA
WITH DEREK AND MEREDITH

31:42.501 --> 31:44.603
IF THEY DON'T END UP
WITH KIDS OF THEIR OWN.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.335
HE SAID NO.

31:46.335 --> 31:47.476
WHY?

31:47.476 --> 31:48.607
BECAUSE YOUR CHILD
IS NOT A RENTAL CAR.

31:48.607 --> 31:51.310
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE HER OUT
ONE WEEK A MONTH.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.511
HAVE YOU SEEN HER? 'CAUSE SHE'S
HEART-STOPPINGLY ADORABLE.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.642
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT.

31:53.642 --> 31:55.314
HE'S MISSING THE POINT.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.316
NO, SHE'S DELICIOUS.
SHE'S ADDICTIVE.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.587
WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT
TO PARENT HER?
I JUST FIND--

31:58.587 --> 32:00.489
AMBULANCE BROKE DOWN, LIKE,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

32:00.489 --> 32:02.421
THEY CAN'T MOVE.
THEY CAN'T GET OUT.
DID THEY SEND A BACKUP?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.293
IT'S--IT'S COMING,
BUT IT'S SLOW.
PUT HER ON SPEAKERPHONE.

32:04.293 --> 32:05.294
YEAH.
(beeps)

32:05.294 --> 32:06.655
(static crackling)
ALEX?

32:06.655 --> 32:08.427
We can't move.
We're a friggin' sitting duck.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.628
We... the... ba--

32:09.628 --> 32:11.430
ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON. I CAN'T
HEAR YOU. SAY THAT AGAIN.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.601
We gotta take the baby
out of here,

32:12.601 --> 32:14.603
but the two of us can't move
the damned incubator

32:14.603 --> 32:16.465
and all this crap
on a highway.

32:16.465 --> 32:17.536
DID YOU SET UP
THE FLARES?

32:17.536 --> 32:18.667
OKAY, LEAVE THE PHONE.

32:18.667 --> 32:20.469
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
A HELICOPTER UP THERE.

32:20.469 --> 32:22.441
YEAH. TAKE THIS?
(static crackling)

32:22.441 --> 32:25.644
(monitor beeping erratically)

32:29.518 --> 32:31.550
SIR, IT'S BEEN 20 MINUTES.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.482
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT HEART'S COMING BACK.

32:33.482 --> 32:34.583
(beeping continues)

32:34.583 --> 32:36.385
SIR, THERE'S NO BLOOD
LEFT TO CIRCULATE.

32:36.385 --> 32:37.686
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE...

33:00.449 --> 33:01.710
8:52 P.M.

33:04.453 --> 33:07.356
THERE WAS NO WAY TO TAKE IT OUT
WITHOUT KILLING HIM.

33:07.356 --> 33:09.418
(tone stops)
AND THERE'S NO WAY
HE COULD'VE LIVED WITH IT

(static crackles)

35:11.710 --> 35:13.482
WHAT?

35:13.482 --> 35:14.813
We can't regulate her temp

THE KID.

35:21.490 --> 35:23.592

GET OUT.

AND THEN--

36:13.171 --> 36:15.304
AND WHAT, IT JUST FELL APART
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS?

36:15.304 --> 36:17.876
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DON'T CHECK

36:17.876 --> 36:20.949
IF A VERTEBRA IS COMPROMISED
BEFORE YOU DROP A SCREW IN IT.

36:20.949 --> 36:22.811
HEY.

HOW'S IT GOING
WITH HENRY?

36:24.182 --> 36:25.183
UH, THEY'RE DONE.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.184
OH.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.185
YOU ALMOST FINISHED HERE?

36:27.185 --> 36:28.317
OH, IT'S GONNA BE
A WHILE.

36:28.317 --> 36:31.260
TORRES MISSED A LOOSE SCREW
IN THIS WOMAN'S SPINE.

36:31.260 --> 36:33.262
IT TORE APART
HER WHOLE LEFT VENTRICLE.

36:33.262 --> 36:35.264
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

36:35.264 --> 36:36.895
I PUT IN A PATCH.

36:36.895 --> 36:38.297
I'VE, UH, STILL GOTTA
REINFORCE IT

36:38.297 --> 36:39.928
WITH A MUSCLE FLAP.

36:39.928 --> 36:41.770
IT'S JUST--IT'S--
IT'S A MESS.

36:41.770 --> 36:43.932
HEY, WILL YOU--WILL YOU
CHECK ON HENRY

36:43.932 --> 36:45.304
AND SEE IF HE'S FEELING OKAY?

36:45.304 --> 36:47.906
I... (exhales) I TOLD HIM
I WOULD BE IN POST-OP.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.908
AND I WASN'T IN PRE-OP.
I'M--I'M A BAD WIFE.

36:49.908 --> 36:51.880
I'LL TAKE OVER HERE.
YOU CAN--YOU CAN GO OUT.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.343
(chuckles)
ALL DUE RESPECT,

36:54.343 --> 36:57.316
BUTYOU
ARE OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.350
WHY DOES YOUR FACE
LOOK LIKE THAT?

37:01.350 --> 37:05.324
OH, THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE
BROKE DOWN ON ROUTE 2,

37:05.324 --> 37:06.955
SO WE--WE LOST CONTACT.

37:06.955 --> 37:08.357
OH, I HOPE EVERYONE'S
ALL RIGHT.

37:08.357 --> 37:10.228
OHH, ROUTE 2 AT NIGHT?

37:10.228 --> 37:11.360
AWFUL.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.262
GOING OVER THOSE MOUNTAINS?

37:13.262 --> 37:14.933
SO...

37:14.933 --> 37:16.004
HENRY...

37:16.004 --> 37:17.806
WANTS TO GO TO MED SCHOOL.

37:17.806 --> 37:19.007
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

37:20.839 --> 37:21.970
NO.

37:21.970 --> 37:24.813
I MEAN, I-I SQUASHED THE IDEA
LIKE A BUG,

37:24.813 --> 37:27.316
WHICH I FEEL AWFUL ABOUT,
BUT I MEAN, COME ON.

37:27.316 --> 37:29.378
I MEAN, A MED STUDENT
AT HIS AGE?

37:29.378 --> 37:32.321
THAT'S CRAZY, RIGHT? OR--OR AM I
JUST A TERRIBLE PERSON?

37:32.321 --> 37:33.382
NO.

37:33.382 --> 37:36.855
NO, I'M NOT,
OR IT'S NOT CRAZY?

37:36.855 --> 37:37.986
THE PATCH ISN'T HOLDING.

37:37.986 --> 37:39.988
OH, WE CANNOT GET
A BREAK HERE.

37:39.988 --> 37:42.991
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY
A PLEDGET.

37:42.991 --> 37:44.333
CHECK ON HIM,

37:44.333 --> 37:46.335
LET ME KNOW HOW HE'S FEELING--
WOULD YOU?

37:46.335 --> 37:48.967
(sighs)
YEAH, OF COURSE.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.999
OH, AND, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU GET BORED,

37:50.999 --> 37:54.403
I MEAN, YOU COULD MENTION THAT
MED SCHOOL IS ALONG HAUL,

37:54.403 --> 37:56.044
AND, YOU KNOW, HE MAY WANT

37:56.044 --> 37:58.347
TO TRY TO GET A DEGREE
IN SOMETHING ELSE.

37:58.347 --> 37:59.408
OH, AND... (chuckles)

37:59.408 --> 38:01.380
HE'S A REAL STONER
ON DILAUDID.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.911
(laughs)

38:02.911 --> 38:04.383
SO DON'T BE SURPRISED
IF HE COMPLIMENTS YOUR EYES.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.893
(dial tone droning)

38:19.968 --> 38:23.872
(dial tone continues)

38:23.872 --> 38:25.934
(busy signal beeping)

38:25.934 --> 38:27.336
I JUST SPOKE
TO EMERGENCY DISPATCH.

38:27.336 --> 38:29.007
ANOTHER AMBULANCE IS COMING NOW.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.339
THE COPS ARE A FEW MINUTES OUT,

38:30.339 --> 38:31.340
AND THE HELICOPTER
WOULDN'T BE ANY FASTER

38:31.340 --> 38:32.411
SINCE THEY LEAVE OUT
OF SKYKOMISH.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.312
ARE WE STILL ON SPEAKER
OR WHAT?

38:34.312 --> 38:36.084
UH, WE WERE TALKING
TO THEM

38:36.084 --> 38:38.887
AND THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE
AND...

38:38.887 --> 38:40.048
WE LOST THEM.

38:42.020 --> 38:44.022
(Mark) AVERY,

38:44.022 --> 38:46.355
DR. SHEPHERD'S GONNA
PUT DOWN HIS INSTRUMENTS

38:46.355 --> 38:48.357
AND YOU'RE GONNA
STEP IN FOR HIM.

38:48.357 --> 38:51.099
FANCY PART'S OVER.
WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THE REST.

38:51.099 --> 38:53.061
DEREK.

38:56.104 --> 38:57.966
(sighs)

38:57.966 --> 39:00.369
ALL RIGHT.

39:00.369 --> 39:01.970
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

39:01.970 --> 39:04.443
WHO'S GONNA TAKE OVER
IN THE MIDDLE OF A BYPASS?

39:04.443 --> 39:06.044
THERE'S A WOMAN ON THE TABLE

39:06.044 --> 39:08.016
WHO DIES IF TEDDY WALKS OUT
OF THAT O.R.

39:08.016 --> 39:09.077
IT'S HER HUSBAND, RICHARD.

39:09.077 --> 39:11.380
ANOTHER HOUR
ISN'T GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.951
GOLDMAN'S ON HIS WAY.
TELL HER THEN.

39:12.951 --> 39:13.982
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

39:13.982 --> 39:15.083
YOU'RE NOT HER FRIEND
RIGHT NOW.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.985
YOU'RE THE CHIEF OF SURGERY.

39:16.985 --> 39:18.427
(sighs) IF SHE FINDS OUT
THAT I WAITED,

39:18.427 --> 39:21.390
SHE WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.992
HER HUSBAND JUST DIED
IN OUR O.R.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.436
SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE
ANY OF US.

39:30.499 --> 39:32.070
HUNT.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.142
MEREDITH AND ALEX ARE TRAPPED
IN AN AMBULANCE

39:34.142 --> 39:36.074
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.
I KNOW.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.145
WE JUST LOST CONTACT.
I THINK THEY GOT HIT.

39:37.145 --> 39:39.147
WE NEED TO GET
EMERGENCY DISPATCH ON THE PHONE.

39:39.147 --> 39:42.150
(cell phone beeps)

39:42.150 --> 39:45.083
WHAT IS IT?

39:45.083 --> 39:47.155
WHAT?

39:47.155 --> 39:48.957
(monitor beeping erratically)

39:48.957 --> 39:50.959
ALL RIGHT. THE VENTRICULAR
LACERATION IS STILL BLEEDING.

39:50.959 --> 39:52.991
WE NEED MORE VOLUME.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.963
WE NEED SOME MORE BLOOD.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

39:54.963 --> 39:56.164
(April)
SHE'S DROPPING AGAIN.

39:56.164 --> 39:59.097
COME ON, LAURA.
YOU GOTTA PULL IT TOGETHER.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.099
(beeping continues)

40:01.099 --> 40:02.100
(beeping normalizes)

40:02.100 --> 40:04.503
OKAY, GOOD. UH, THERE WE GO.
90 OVER 60.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.075
GOOD. HELLO AGAIN.
HOW'S HE DOING?

40:07.075 --> 40:09.538
UH, HE'S FINE. WOOZY.
UM, VITALS ARE GOOD.

40:09.538 --> 40:12.010
UH, DID THEY RUN
A POST-OP C.T.?

40:12.010 --> 40:13.982
UH, NOT YET.

40:13.982 --> 40:15.514
BUT CRISTINA FELT
SHE GOT CLEAN MARGINS?

40:15.514 --> 40:17.986
OH, YES.

40:17.986 --> 40:21.019
DID SHE FIGURE IT OUT,

40:21.019 --> 40:22.451
WHO SHE WAS OPERATING ON?

40:22.451 --> 40:24.453
(chuckles) NO.

40:24.453 --> 40:26.124
SEE? I TOLD YOU.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.526
SOMETIMES
HER LACK OF INTEREST

40:27.526 --> 40:29.528
IN THE PATIENT
AS A HUMAN BEING

40:29.528 --> 40:31.530
CAN COME IN HANDY.

40:31.530 --> 40:34.062
DID YOU MENTION
THE MED SCHOOL THING TO HENRY?

40:34.062 --> 40:36.434
(chuckles) NO.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.106
YOU'RE A COWARD.

40:38.106 --> 40:39.508
(chuckles)

40:39.508 --> 40:42.010
YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK YOU ARE
OFF THE HOOK, YOU ARE WRONG.

40:42.010 --> 40:44.012
I MEAN, THIS COULD RUIN THE NEXT
FIVE TO TEN YEARS OF MY LIFE.

40:44.012 --> 40:45.544
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT,
RIGHT?

40:45.544 --> 40:48.016
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE...
