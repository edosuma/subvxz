I think we have all our --
our deal points done.

1:01:31.489 --> 1:01:32.926
They're still
being a little --

1:01:32.959 --> 1:01:34.830
Rachel, what are you
talking about?

1:01:34.863 --> 1:01:37.133
I haven't heard from you
in three weeks.

1:01:44.081 --> 1:01:45.718
Wow. Do you --

1:01:48.089 --> 1:01:49.993
Do you ever get déjà vu?

1:01:51.563 --> 1:01:54.435
Rachel, are you okay?
It's 7:00 a.m.

1:01:54.468 --> 1:01:58.076
[ stammers ] Uh, no.
I-I-I had to go out of town.

1:01:58.109 --> 1:02:00.080
It was a --
It was a family emergency.

1:02:00.113 --> 1:02:02.819
Simone said
you were in meetings.

1:02:02.852 --> 1:02:04.221
I called you.

1:02:04.254 --> 1:02:07.127
My lawyer called and said
you weren't returning.

1:02:08.964 --> 1:02:10.433
I called Matt.

1:02:13.072 --> 1:02:14.943
Wait. My Matt?

1:02:14.976 --> 1:02:18.016
My Matt.

1:02:18.049 --> 1:02:19.986
I went back to Alfooz.

1:02:25.330 --> 1:02:27.836
You disappeared!

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:30.040
I couldn't let it
fall apart.

1:02:30.073 --> 1:02:32.111
I worked too hard
to let it fall apart.

1:02:32.144 --> 1:02:34.983
No, no, no, of course.
No, y-you did the right thing.

1:02:35.016 --> 1:02:37.321
Absolutely.

1:02:37.354 --> 1:02:39.492
Uh, let me -- let me know

1:02:39.526 --> 1:02:42.031
if Matt needs any help
with the transition.

1:02:42.064 --> 1:02:44.101
Rachel --
Wait. Is it --
Is the deal done?

1:02:44.134 --> 1:02:46.372
Did he handle it?

1:02:46.405 --> 1:02:49.779
Yeah, he got it.
All of it.

1:02:51.516 --> 1:02:53.386
It's fine now.

1:02:53.419 --> 1:02:54.856
Rachel, are you --

1:02:54.889 --> 1:02:58.930
I-I'm -- I'm fine.
Yeah. I mean...

1:03:01.402 --> 1:03:03.541
No, it's been a --
it's been a rough week,

1:03:03.574 --> 1:03:05.844
but, you know,
it's -- it's fine.

1:03:10.588 --> 1:03:12.390
I am so p--

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:23.079
I'm so proud
of what you achieved.

1:03:28.590 --> 1:03:30.994
I'm very sorry
I let you down.

1:03:34.301 --> 1:03:36.305
Rachel had discovered her.

1:03:36.338 --> 1:03:39.111
She'd believed in her when
Matt was still calling her

1:03:39.144 --> 1:03:42.986
a diversity hire
for TV rooms behind her back.

1:03:43.019 --> 1:03:45.992
See? Unacceptable.

1:03:46.025 --> 1:03:48.096
And then I realized
I was hungry

1:03:48.129 --> 1:03:50.300
and if I saw them
when I was hungry

1:03:50.333 --> 1:03:53.039
I was gonna have to leave
to get something to eat,

1:03:53.072 --> 1:03:57.047
so I-I went looking for carbs
and I got a bagel

1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:01.255
and then --
and then I saw you.

1:04:05.363 --> 1:04:07.968
Are you sure I-I can't
get you anything?

1:04:11.108 --> 1:04:13.146
Her story was
all over the place.

1:04:13.179 --> 1:04:16.185
There were several days
she just couldn't account for.

1:04:16.218 --> 1:04:18.022
And half of it didn't add up.

1:04:18.055 --> 1:04:21.428
I don't really remember putting
newspaper on the windows.

1:04:35.490 --> 1:04:37.561
I think you need
some help, Rachel.

1:04:40.634 --> 1:04:42.471
Come on.

1:04:42.505 --> 1:04:44.509
I'd spent the whole summer
listening to Toby's story,

1:04:44.542 --> 1:04:46.513
seeing it through
his eyes alone.

1:04:46.546 --> 1:04:48.984
I'd forgotten an essential
truth of reporting,

1:04:49.017 --> 1:04:50.988
which is that
you should always wonder,

1:04:51.021 --> 1:04:53.259
when you're hearing
someone's version of things,

1:04:53.292 --> 1:04:55.096
what the other person
in the story --

1:04:55.129 --> 1:04:58.637
the one who wasn't there --
would say if he were.

1:04:58.670 --> 1:05:00.641
I'd forgotten that lesson,
which I had learned

1:05:00.674 --> 1:05:02.645
on every story I ever did.

1:05:02.678 --> 1:05:05.250
It was that there are
no real villains in life,

1:05:05.283 --> 1:05:06.587
not really.

1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:08.256
There are no real heroes,
either.

1:05:08.289 --> 1:05:11.128
Everyone is great
and everyone is terrible

1:05:11.161 --> 1:05:12.665
and everyone is flawed,

1:05:12.698 --> 1:05:15.270
and there are
no exceptions to that.

1:05:15.303 --> 1:05:17.675
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:05:17.708 --> 1:05:22.251
Just try to sleep.
Okay?

1:05:22.284 --> 1:05:24.623
I'll sit here with you.

1:05:24.656 --> 1:05:27.460
And I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1:05:30.033 --> 1:05:32.739
You know,
I always liked you.

1:05:32.772 --> 1:05:35.143
I just thought
you didn't like me.
