01:00.226 --> 01:01.394
Here she comes.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.147
Hi, Mrs. Foutley.

01:05.230 --> 01:05.522
Hello, Mrs. Foutley.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.317
Oh, hi, Ginger.

01:07.400 --> 01:07.942
Did you ask your mom?

01:08.026 --> 01:10.153
Did she ask her mom
what?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.321
Did she say yes?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.655
Did I say yes to what?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.033
{\an1}The annual Lucky Junior High
ski trip.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.493
It's this weekend and...

01:16.576 --> 01:18.161
Thanks for the ride, Mom.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.662
Got to run.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.538
Don't slam it!
Don't slam it!

01:20.622 --> 01:23.750
(<i> slam, clank</i> )

01:23.833 --> 01:25.084
{\an8}Ginger Foutley, tomorrow
is your last chance

01:25.168 --> 01:28.463
{\an8}to turn in
the permission slip
for the ski trip.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.839
{\an7}I know.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.634
Ginger, are you afraid
your mom will say no?

01:32.717 --> 01:34.511
Is that why you
haven't asked?

01:34.594 --> 01:35.470
Talk about it at
lunch, Dodie, okay?

01:35.553 --> 01:37.764
(<i> bell rings</i> )

01:37.847 --> 01:39.974
Bell! That...
that will be the bell.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.060
{\an7}Come lunch,
I want one good reason

01:42.143 --> 01:44.604
{\an7}you're avoiding
this ski trip, Ginger...

01:49.692 --> 01:51.861
{\an8}Do you know what
this is, Hoodsey?

01:51.945 --> 01:55.198
{\an7}A flyer for the
Lucky Junior High ski trip?

01:55.281 --> 01:58.034
Yes... and do you
know what it means?

01:58.117 --> 02:01.579
{\an1}"Kids from ages 12 to 14
are invited to partake

02:01.663 --> 02:05.500
{\an1}in the powdery slopes of
the illustrious Mount Bear?"

02:05.583 --> 02:07.836
{\an1}Foutley, I'm taking
this chair.

02:07.919 --> 02:08.961
{\an8}Request denied.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.589
{\an8}This is our chance
at the big time.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.423
Uh...
I don't get it.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.342
Foutley...

02:14.425 --> 02:16.052
I said <i> denied,</i>
Terrence!

02:16.135 --> 02:17.846
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

02:17.929 --> 02:21.683
{\an1}What does the junior high
ski trip have to do with us?

02:21.766 --> 02:24.727
(<i> talking with mouth full</i> )

02:24.811 --> 02:28.857
{\an1}But, Carl, I don't know
if I'm allowed to do that.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.401
Well? Out with it, Ginger.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.988
Why in the world are you
trying to dodge this trip?

02:35.071 --> 02:38.575
{\an5}Is this about how red
your nose tends to
get in the cold?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.910
Because I cannot
stress enough

02:40.994 --> 02:44.414
{\an1}the absolute magic
a good concealer can work.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.707
Take for example

02:45.790 --> 02:48.084
the swollen hive
on Macie's lip.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.087
{\an1}Once a hideous,
disfiguring pustule...

02:51.170 --> 02:52.922
now next to invisible.

02:53.006 --> 02:57.302
Thanks to Dodie,
my little angora allergy

02:57.385 --> 02:59.220
is nobody's business
but my own.

02:59.304 --> 03:03.850
I can work this same miracle
for you, Ginger Foutley.

03:03.933 --> 03:07.228
You guys...
it's not about my nose.

03:10.356 --> 03:10.732
{\an1}Ski trip?

03:10.815 --> 03:14.319
How incredibly lame.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.738
At least it's coed.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.447
Let's say we make

03:17.530 --> 03:20.116
a little bet
to spice things up.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.118
{\an1}What did you have
in mind?

03:22.201 --> 03:24.203
Something that makes the ski
trip more interesting for us

03:24.287 --> 03:26.789
while manipulating one or
more of our classmates?

03:26.873 --> 03:30.668
Ooh, Miranda, you're so bad!

03:30.752 --> 03:34.380
{\an5}I bet you that I can get
the exchange student
from France...

03:34.464 --> 03:35.506
Jean-Pierre?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.592
to go to first base
on the chair lift.

03:37.675 --> 03:38.801
Ooh, I like.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.469
I like very much.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.971
{\an1}Who with?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.681
Well, it has to be
a challenge.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.183
Ginger Foutley.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.811
Foutley? Jean-Pierre
wouldn't touch that friz-bag

03:48.895 --> 03:50.355
with a ten-foot ski pole.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.607
{\an1}Winner does math homework
for a week.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.900
You're going down.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.443
You are so going down.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.819
Oh, really?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.447
{\an1}Well, I wouldn't
underestimate Miss Ginger

03:59.530 --> 04:00.949
if I were you, Miranda.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.242
Some people find her charm
positively contagious.

04:06.120 --> 04:06.829
Hey, what's up, ladies?

04:06.913 --> 04:09.332
{\an5}Hi, Darren.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.332
Darren!

04:09.415 --> 04:10.375
Hello, Darren.

04:10.458 --> 04:13.294
{\an1}Are you going to eat
that tartar sauce?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.837
Uh, probably not.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.005
Darren, would you
please tell Ginger

04:16.089 --> 04:18.675
that no one
in their right mind

04:18.757 --> 04:22.053
would miss the Lucky Junior High
ski trip this weekend?

04:22.136 --> 04:23.179
I'm not going.

04:23.262 --> 04:24.639
Really, Darren? Why?

04:24.722 --> 04:27.350
I'm having the rack tightened
on Saturday morning.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.478
{\an5}If I don't black out,
I'm usually in bed
for the rest of day.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.813
Oh...

04:31.896 --> 04:33.523
{\an1}Are you a fan
of the tapioca or...

04:33.606 --> 04:34.857
Go ahead.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.193
{\an1}What about your
lactose intolerance?

04:38.486 --> 04:40.697
Life is short, Ginger.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.366
{\an5}Ginger, lunch is
three-quarters
of the way over

04:43.449 --> 04:44.200
and you still
haven't told me

04:44.283 --> 04:47.286
why you don't want to
go on the ski trip.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.789
I don't want to go
on the ski trip because...

04:49.872 --> 04:54.210
<i>I can't ski!</i>

04:54.293 --> 04:56.379
What in the world
does the ski trip

04:56.462 --> 04:57.672
have to do
with skiing?

04:57.755 --> 04:58.673
Dodie's right.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.884
{\an1}There's plenty of other
activities to indulge in.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.595
{\an5}Like hot chocolate
at the ski lodge...
(<i> sighs</i> )

05:04.679 --> 05:08.766
{\an1}Or having your picture taken
with a cute instructor. Hello!

05:08.850 --> 05:11.728
I guess you're right.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.104
You can have a great time
on the ski trip

05:13.187 --> 05:16.232
without ever setting foot
on the slopes.

05:16.315 --> 05:20.403
And who in their
right mind would?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.404
(<i> chuckles</i> )

05:21.487 --> 05:21.821
Thanks, you guys.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.781
So you're in?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.159
{\an1}I'm... in.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.535
Ooh, whee!

05:27.618 --> 05:28.369
Now, all we have to do

05:28.453 --> 05:31.247
is plan your
not-skiing ski ensemble

05:31.330 --> 05:33.249
and who better
to do that than...

05:33.332 --> 05:35.752
Macie:
Courtney Gripling...

05:35.835 --> 05:37.295
Hi, Courtney.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.504
Ginger!

05:38.588 --> 05:40.423
Podie, Stacy.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.926
Uh, she's Podie, I'm Stacy.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.054
{\an1}Whatever. Ginger,
you are going

05:46.137 --> 05:47.680
{\an4}on the ski trip
this weekend,
aren't you?

05:47.764 --> 05:49.682
Absolutely.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.933
I mean, I haven't
asked my mom yet

05:51.017 --> 05:53.603
but I'm sure
she'll say yes.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.229
You ski?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.774
Not really,
but I'll wing it.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.776
The girl's got moxie.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.319
{\an1}I'm really glad
you're going

06:01.402 --> 06:04.781
{\an4}because that hot new
foreign exchange student
will be there.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.866
{\an1}And someone told me
that he told them

06:06.949 --> 06:10.036
{\an1}to tell me to tell you
that he may want to sit with you

06:10.119 --> 06:11.954
{\an1}on the chair lift ride
and then

06:12.038 --> 06:15.666
{\an1}ski down a more advanced slope,
if you know what I mean.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.962
{\an5}Ginger's not ready
for a more advanced
slope, Courtney.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.548
She's not ready for any slope.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.925
Oh, I think she is, Casey.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.552
Something tells me she is.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.684
{\an5}Lois:
I signed the
permission slip.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.811
It's on the fridge.

06:34.894 --> 06:35.686
Why did you wait so long?

06:35.770 --> 06:38.606
Where's the super-strength
electrical tape?

06:38.689 --> 06:40.691
In the crisper,
where you left it.

06:40.775 --> 06:41.984
I don't know.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.237
{\an1}Maybe I was just
nervous or something.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.488
{\an1}Lois:
About what?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.365
Mom, were you going to
throw away

06:47.448 --> 06:48.616
this rotting cabbage

06:48.699 --> 06:49.992
and if so can I have it
to throw at a car?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.036
Yes and
absolutely not.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.287
{\an1}It's kind of
complicated, Mom.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.083
{\an5}You don't
have to tell me
about complicated.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.751
I birthed your brother.

06:58.835 --> 07:02.880
{\an1}Mom! I can't talk to you
about these kind of things.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.299
What kind of things?

07:05.383 --> 07:08.094
{\an5}Can't we at least
talk about what we
can't talk about?

07:08.177 --> 07:10.138
Okay... it's like this.

07:10.221 --> 07:14.016
{\an1}At first I didn't want
go on the ski trip

07:14.100 --> 07:16.811
{\an1}because of this
one thing, right?

07:16.894 --> 07:17.520
{\an3}Right...

07:17.603 --> 07:20.523
{\an1}But that's not
the thing anymore.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.899
Well, that's good.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.944
{\an1}I mean, what I was
nervous about at first

07:25.027 --> 07:27.071
only felt like a big deal

07:27.155 --> 07:31.200
{\an1}but what I'm nervous about now
is a much bigger deal.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.493
Uh-oh.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.829
So that's not so good.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.873
What I'm trying to say is, uh...

07:36.956 --> 07:43.963
{\an5}how old were you
the first time you went
on a more "advanced" slope?

07:45.339 --> 07:47.800
We're not talking about
skiing anymore, are we?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.720
Not really.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.973
Carl, go throw the
cabbage at our car.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.808
{\an1}Right on!

07:59.812 --> 08:01.480
Oh, Ging, it seems
like just yesterday

08:01.564 --> 08:05.234
{\an5}that you were learning
to use your red plastic
potty.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.488
(<i> echoing</i> ):
<i>Remember that one?</i>

08:09.572 --> 08:10.948
I don't know, Dodie.

08:11.032 --> 08:14.911
My mom went off on this total
toilet-training tangent

08:14.994 --> 08:17.079
and then hugged me for,
like, 45 minutes.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.498
It was really weird.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.750
Let's put a pin in that.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.585
Have you decided
what you're wearing?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.254
{\an5}Woman on phone:
Dodie, give it a rest.
It's dinner.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.049
{\an1}Ginger, send
Robert Joseph home.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.467
Sure, Mrs. Bishop. Bye.

08:29.550 --> 08:33.261
We'll accessorize after dinner,
okay?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.429
Call you later.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.890
Hoodsey, man, we are
going to be famous.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.433
I've always wanted to
set a world record.

08:38.517 --> 08:41.312
{\an1}Longest amount of time
trapped in a chair lift.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.524
{\an1}I've got to say,
I like the ring of it.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.152
{\an5}Can we go throw
another cabbage
at your mom's car?

08:48.236 --> 08:48.945
{\an1}Not now,
we're in training.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.197
But I'm really hot, Carl!

08:51.280 --> 08:54.200
I'm sweating a whole lot!

08:54.283 --> 08:56.369
I think I even smell bad!

08:56.452 --> 08:59.288
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

08:59.372 --> 09:00.790
(<i> knock on door</i> )

09:00.873 --> 09:02.750
{\an1}Both:
Identify yourself!

09:02.833 --> 09:04.460
Ginger Foutley,
sister of Carl.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.046
{\an5}Carl:
State the nature
of your business.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.257
Message for Hoodsey.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.091
Your mom wants you home.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.468
It's time for dinner.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.511
Us, too, Carl.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.637
Oh... yes! Whoa!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.305
(<i> grunting</i> )

09:16.389 --> 09:17.557
Sorry, Carl.

09:17.640 --> 09:18.766
Got to go!

09:18.849 --> 09:20.643
What are you doing, Carl?

09:20.726 --> 09:22.311
Information's classified.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.814
{\an1}Oh, uh, say,
would you tell mom

09:24.897 --> 09:28.150
{\an1}I'll be taking supper in my
sleeping quarters this evening?

09:28.234 --> 09:32.363
{\an5}And if it's not a problem,
I'd like my fruit cocktail
baked inside my potato.

09:32.446 --> 09:33.614
Thanks in advance.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.533
(<i> groans</i> )

09:43.916 --> 09:48.337
{\an5}<i>The idea that an exotic boy</i>
<i>like Jean-Pierre told someone</i>
<i>to tell Courtney</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:54.510
{\an5}<i>to tell me that he may want to</i>
<i>sit with me on the chair lift</i>
<i>is really kind of exciting.</i>

09:54.593 --> 09:57.763
<i>But I still feel</i>
<i>like a total spaz!</i>

09:57.847 --> 10:00.683
<i>Plus, I don't want Ian Richton</i>
<i>to get the wrong idea.</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:05.104
<i>Oh, man... and I thought skiing</i>
<i>was overwhelming.</i>

10:06.605 --> 10:07.898
(<i> Carl yawns</i> )

10:07.982 --> 10:09.817
(<i> hammering</i> )

10:09.900 --> 10:10.359
(<i> drilling</i> )

10:10.443 --> 10:12.403
Carl, what are you doing?!

10:12.486 --> 10:13.362
Nothing, Ma!

10:13.446 --> 10:14.613
Morning!
(<i> gargles</i> )

10:14.697 --> 10:15.781
Ging, you up?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.033
We need to leave in 20.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.534
I'm up!

10:18.617 --> 10:23.414
<i>All in all, I guess things</i>
<i>could be worse.</i>

10:23.497 --> 10:26.125
{\an1}I got my old ski jacket
out of mothballs for you.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.210
You'll be plenty toasty
in this baby.

10:29.462 --> 10:33.174
<i>Uh, things just got worse.</i>

10:40.514 --> 10:41.057
(<i> Carl grunts</i> )

10:41.140 --> 10:43.100
Go, go, go, go, go!

10:43.184 --> 10:44.060
Hold your horses, Carl.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.478
I have to lock up.

10:45.561 --> 10:49.732
And then she sprayed it
with Lady Musk

10:49.815 --> 10:51.233
to hide the smell.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.110
Looks kind of dirty.

10:53.194 --> 10:57.073
That's because she's had it
since she was a kid.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.033
It's totally ancient.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.410
Um, well, let's try
calling it vintage.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.497
You know what I always say:

11:04.580 --> 11:06.665
{\an1}You can't judge a candy bar
by its wrapper.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.628
I'll need my dry cleaning
picked up

11:10.711 --> 11:12.254
my phone messages returned

11:12.338 --> 11:13.339
and my homework assignments
finished

11:13.422 --> 11:15.508
by the time I get back.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.592
Okay, thanks, Daddy.

11:16.675 --> 11:17.176
You're an absolute angel.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.096
(<i> thumping</i> )

11:20.179 --> 11:20.888
Careful with
that luggage!

11:20.971 --> 11:23.015
It's snake.

11:32.441 --> 11:36.987
{\an1}Oh... interesting ensemble,
Ginger.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.366
Uh, thanks... it's vintage.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.410
Oh-ho-ho...

11:42.493 --> 11:43.744
Jean-Pierre.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.829
Oh...

11:44.912 --> 11:46.580
{\an1}Look what the cat
hacked up.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.583
{\an1}You've got your work cut out
for you, Miss Gripling.

11:49.667 --> 11:52.795
Miranda, would you mind
scooting back a seat?

11:52.878 --> 11:55.798
Ginger and I really want
to sit together.

11:55.881 --> 11:56.924
{\an1}Excuse me?

11:57.007 --> 11:57.466
That's okay, Courtney.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.677
I should probably just...

11:59.760 --> 12:00.719
Move it. Now!

12:04.223 --> 12:08.310
{\an5}I'm supposed to be
saving this seat for
someone, Miranda.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.189
And that someone is you.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.649
Now, I must forewarn you

12:13.732 --> 12:16.652
that I'm prone to motion
sickness and/or vomiting

12:16.735 --> 12:18.112
so if you're squeamish...

12:18.195 --> 12:19.530
I'm not squeamish.

12:19.613 --> 12:20.990
Oh, of course not.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.706
Carl and Hoodsey:
Whoa!

12:28.789 --> 12:31.292
I can't feel my shins, Carl.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.253
Are you sure this is worth it?

12:34.336 --> 12:34.837
(<i> laughs</i> )

12:34.920 --> 12:36.672
This is
going to be better

12:36.755 --> 12:38.716
than our mutated
cupcake experiment.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.677
Uh, what if I have to go
to the bathroom?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.680
That's what the newspaper
is for, Hoodsey.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.348
(<i> grunting</i> )

12:46.432 --> 12:47.975
Ooh, uh, uh, say, Miranda

12:48.058 --> 12:54.315
there's no way some zombies
are on top of the bus, right?

12:54.398 --> 12:55.900
Because I remember...

12:55.983 --> 12:57.693
{\an1}Shh! I'm trying
to listen!

12:57.776 --> 13:00.571
Now, tell me about
your experience.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.864
So far, so good.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.826
Seats could be a little
more comfortable, but...

13:05.910 --> 13:09.705
I mean, tell me about
your experience <i> with boys.</i>

13:09.788 --> 13:12.541
Oh... right...

13:12.625 --> 13:14.335
Ooh, last summer
she accidentally

13:14.418 --> 13:16.378
kicked Stuart Higsby
in the...

13:16.462 --> 13:17.713
Hi, we're busy right now.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.173
Leave a message
and we'll get back to you.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.175
Beep!

13:21.258 --> 13:22.343
You were saying.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.762
In the second grade

13:24.845 --> 13:28.599
I held Johnny Jefferie's hand
on a class trip.

13:28.682 --> 13:32.061
Hands cupped
or fingers laced?

13:32.144 --> 13:33.521
Uh... hands cupped.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.772
(<i> snickers</i> )

13:34.855 --> 13:36.023
{\an3}I see...

13:36.106 --> 13:37.066
Ginger, I think

13:37.149 --> 13:39.235
you're a diamond in
the rough, honest!

13:39.318 --> 13:41.904
But if you want to snag
a boy like Jean-Pierre

13:41.987 --> 13:43.364
you're going to
have to act

13:43.447 --> 13:44.990
a little more...
advanced.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.659
(<i> laughs nervously</i> )

13:46.742 --> 13:48.994
What did you have in mind?

13:49.078 --> 13:53.290
(<i> whispering...</i> )

14:04.510 --> 14:05.844
{\an1}Oh...!

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
Now the plan is

14:07.012 --> 14:08.180
{\an1}stay away
from the chair lift

14:08.264 --> 14:10.140
at all costs.

14:10.224 --> 14:10.766
Otherwise, we... ow!

14:10.849 --> 14:14.603
{\an1}Hey! You're history,
Marcus!

14:14.687 --> 14:16.105
Mabel, Mabel,
if you're able

14:16.188 --> 14:17.982
save your horseplay
for the stable.

14:21.318 --> 14:24.154
(<i> grunting and groaning...</i> )

14:28.033 --> 14:30.077
(<i> phone rings</i> )

14:30.160 --> 14:31.954
Hello?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.956
Oh, hi, Joanne.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.207
What?

14:35.291 --> 14:36.917
No, they're not here.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.128
Well, I thought
they were at your place.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.840
Well, when last seen, the boys
were dressed in winter clothes

14:42.923 --> 14:46.343
wearing goggles and hanging
from the ceiling in Carl's room.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471
It means I may have a lead.

14:49.555 --> 14:49.888
Call you back.

14:52.349 --> 14:54.977
(<i> muttering...</i> )

14:57.062 --> 14:58.063
(<i> honks horn</i> )

14:58.147 --> 15:00.983
Everything okay, Darren?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.110
I was supposed to see
my ortho today

15:03.193 --> 15:03.902
but Dr. Weinstein
canceled.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.780
{\an1}Now I missed the ski trip
for nothing.

15:06.864 --> 15:09.199
{\an1}Well, today is
your lucky day, kiddo.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.874
{\an1}Well, what does she mean
by "advanced"?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.500
First base, Dodie.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.670
Oh, I knew I shouldn't
have come on this trip.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.007
Courtney wants you
to go to first base?!

15:25.090 --> 15:25.924
Shh...!

15:26.008 --> 15:28.469
What is first base exactly?

15:28.552 --> 15:29.803
French kissing.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.680
Everybody knows that.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140
Sorry...

15:33.223 --> 15:34.850
{\an1}Heading over
to the lift, Ginger?

15:34.933 --> 15:36.018
Don't take all day.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.687
Or... do.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.023
{\an1}We'll be there
in a minute.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.399
Do you know how to, Dodie?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.943
I mean,<i> kiss</i> kiss?

15:45.027 --> 15:45.611
Of course I do.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.073
You mean you've swapped saliva

15:49.156 --> 15:51.367
and you kept this from me?

15:51.450 --> 15:52.785
Who are you?

15:52.868 --> 15:55.371
{\an1}Well, I mean,
I almost did it once.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.248
It's really simple.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.458
Um, you just do this.

15:59.541 --> 16:02.419
(<i> kissing</i> )

16:02.503 --> 16:08.509
(<i> kissing awkwardly</i> )

16:08.592 --> 16:09.593
(<i> all kissing</i> )

16:09.677 --> 16:14.014
{\an1}Bonjour,
my little snow chickens!

16:23.107 --> 16:25.734
Um, so the plan is
we ride up the chair lift

16:25.818 --> 16:27.486
and then right back down.

16:27.569 --> 16:30.072
You must avoid dismounting
at all costs.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.408
{\an1}Then why do we
have to wear skis?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.244
Thinks of the skis
as an accessory

16:35.327 --> 16:38.580
like a satin purse
or a cute scrunchy.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.333
So, J.P., are you
seeing anyone these days?

16:41.417 --> 16:42.543
Uh, seeing?

16:42.626 --> 16:44.753
What does this mean?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.755
A lot of girls like you,
Jean-Pierre.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.591
You could have your pick
of anyone.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.176
{\an1}It's true.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.597
But is you ask me, I think
Ginger Foutley is pretty cute.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.433
Ginger...

16:57.516 --> 17:00.644
She does have a certain,
I don't know how you say.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.270
(<i> giggles</i> )

17:01.353 --> 17:03.897
Hi, Jean-Pierre.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.943
Ah, sweet Rebecca.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.528
Now, she's cute.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.070
Stay focused.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.656
What can I say?

17:12.740 --> 17:15.576
I love all female girls.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.537
Superman had
his faulty heel, no?

17:18.619 --> 17:23.500
And this, this is my,
how you say... weakness.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.462
Lois:
Oh...

17:26.545 --> 17:27.588
Where did I go wrong?

17:27.671 --> 17:31.800
{\an1}I read to him at night,
he saw a dentist regularly.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.803
There was that nasty
spill from the highchair

17:34.887 --> 17:36.930
but all kids take
a fall sometime, right?

17:37.014 --> 17:41.268
Uh... can we listen
to the radio, Ms. Foutley?

17:45.814 --> 17:48.984
Two to a chair...
tips up...

17:49.067 --> 17:50.152
hands to yourself.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.908
{\an1}Aren't we standing a little
close to the chair lift?

17:55.991 --> 17:58.952
{\an1}Some people might even think
we're in line.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.496
We are in line, Macie.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.663
You know the plan.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.290
Ginger! Up here!

18:03.373 --> 18:05.292
Jean-Pierre
saved you a spot.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.085
Remember to
tilt your head.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.004
{\an1}You don't have to go
through with this.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.464
No skiing involved, right?

18:10.547 --> 18:13.383
None whatsoever.

18:13.467 --> 18:15.177
And what about the kiss?

18:17.054 --> 18:20.390
{\an1}Do what
feels right.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.393
And remember,
no means no.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.439
Ginger! Jean-Pierre
grows impatient. Come!

18:27.523 --> 18:30.025
Two to a chair...
tips up...

18:30.108 --> 18:32.653
hands to yourself.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.905
As I was saying,
you stop the lift

18:34.988 --> 18:37.449
{\an1}and I break you off
a nice fat slice of cake.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.493
Hey, Ging!

18:39.576 --> 18:41.829
{\an1}Carl, what are you
doing here?

18:41.912 --> 18:43.705
Jean-Pierre, Ginger.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.210
{\an5}Hoodsey:
So my man got
a deal or what?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.050
Darren, I'm going to
need your help.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.885
Carl's fast.
He's slippery.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.721
He may be armed
with something gross.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.433
{\an5}Dodie:
Oh... oh, I can hardly
see anything!

19:07.312 --> 19:10.607
{\an1}So, uh... what's it like
being French?

19:10.691 --> 19:13.068
I'm a big fan
of your toast.

19:13.151 --> 19:16.113
Ginger, your <i> nez.</i>

19:16.196 --> 19:19.616
It is...<i> trés rouge.</i>

19:19.700 --> 19:22.077
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just...

19:22.160 --> 19:23.704
Just about
the cutest thing

19:23.787 --> 19:26.915
I have ever
hoped to see.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.460
{\an5}Courtney:
It's easier to keep warm
if you sit closer together.

19:30.544 --> 19:34.006
{\an5}Of course you can
also keep warm by
putting your hood up.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.507
You can do it, Ginger.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.720
(<i> Carl laughs</i> )

19:39.803 --> 19:40.888
{\an3}Yeah!

19:40.971 --> 19:42.180
Hoods, this is it.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.017
{\an1}We're on our way
to world-record fame.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.103
Oh! You rock so hard, Carl!

19:48.186 --> 19:49.062
Oh, boy...

19:49.146 --> 19:51.565
High altitude,
cold temperatures.

19:51.648 --> 19:54.192
That can only mean
one thing....

19:54.276 --> 19:56.737
Both:
Nosebleed!

19:58.238 --> 19:59.615
Uh... we're stuck.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.618
This is terrible.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.828
Is it terrible, Ginger?

20:04.912 --> 20:09.041
Or is it, how you say...
destiny?

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
I don't know.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.086
Maybe it's a little of each.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.798
Hey, look, Carl,
there's your mom.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.050
Hi, Ms. Foutley!

20:18.133 --> 20:20.260
Hoodsey!

20:20.344 --> 20:22.763
Carl, you have eaten
your last potato

20:22.846 --> 20:24.890
with fruit cocktail
baked inside.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.517
Just wait until I get
you down from there.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.312
{\an1}I'm afraid he won't be down
for at least 16 hours.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.356
{\an1}They're trying to set
a world record.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.524
I'll give you
a world record to set.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.609
How does "most unemployed"
sound?

20:35.692 --> 20:37.235
(<i> whimpers</i> )

20:39.571 --> 20:41.615
{\an1}Uh, do you know
Ian Richton?

20:41.698 --> 20:42.950
I don't.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.660
Oh, he's really nice.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.119
Of that I am sure.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.706
{\an5}Ginger...
this small talk
has left your lips

20:49.790 --> 20:52.918
looking a little,
how you say, frosty.

20:53.001 --> 20:56.171
Allow me to warm them
for you.

20:56.254 --> 20:58.131
{\an1}Ooh, you can do it,
Ginger!

20:58.215 --> 20:59.174
You've got what it takes.

20:59.257 --> 21:03.428
Keep in mind, J.P.,
you can have anyone.

21:03.512 --> 21:07.140
{\an5}This is more fun
than skiing, no?
Heh-heh-heh.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.226
No...

21:12.604 --> 21:16.024
Aah... oh!

21:16.108 --> 21:18.485
Aah...!

21:18.568 --> 21:19.653
{\an1}Ginger!

21:19.736 --> 21:21.029
I can't stop!

21:21.113 --> 21:24.658
{\an1}Oh, that was less
than three minutes.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.702
Oh...!

21:26.785 --> 21:28.829
(<i> whimpering</i> )

21:28.912 --> 21:33.375
(<i> screaming and panting</i> )

21:33.458 --> 21:36.545
(<i> laughing</i> )

21:37.713 --> 21:39.965
Hey, Ginger!

21:40.048 --> 21:42.884
I thought you said
you didn't know how to ski.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.388
{\an4}Yeah! But I...
I don't know how to
French kiss either.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.557
Where are you going?
No, turn...!

21:50.058 --> 21:52.853
I'm really sorry, Darren.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.064
I'll carry your books
every day-- promise.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.357
Hey, no sweat.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.152
My brother always said
that wearing a cast

22:00.235 --> 22:03.113
was like a total
babe magnet. (<i> laughs</i> )

22:10.328 --> 22:12.914
<i>So along with</i>
<i>breaking Darren's leg</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:17.836
{\an5}<i>came a valuable lesson</i>
<i>about the importance</i>
<i>of facing your fears.</i>

22:17.919 --> 22:20.464
<i>Not just for me,</i>
<i>but for Carl, too.</i>

22:20.547 --> 22:22.174
I can't believe
you, Carl!

22:22.257 --> 22:23.216
This really
takes the cake!

22:23.300 --> 22:26.386
{\an4}No privileges,
no television,
no sweets...

22:28.013 --> 22:31.933
<i>I suppose skiing and quite</i>
<i>possibly French kissing</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:34.436
<i>is just like everything else.</i>

22:34.519 --> 22:36.396
<i>It looks a lot harder</i>
<i>than it is.</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:39.858
<i>It's actually kind of fun</i>
<i>when you're doing it</i>

22:39.941 --> 22:41.234
<i>and the trickiest part</i>

22:41.318 --> 22:43.028
<i>is knowing when to stop.</i>

22:43.111 --> 22:46.365
<i>But I'll have to get back</i>
<i>to you on the kissing thing...</i>

22:46.448 --> 22:47.908
<i>when I know firsthand.</i>

22:47.991 --> 22:49.951
(<i> chuckles</i> )
