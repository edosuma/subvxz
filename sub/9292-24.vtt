00:16.332 --> 00:17.367
Begin the
launch countdown.

00:17.433 --> 00:18.801
How much time
do you need to cancel

00:18.867 --> 00:20.367
the launch sequence?
I won't know for
certain till I see

00:20.433 --> 00:21.801
how the targeting
software is configured.

00:21.867 --> 00:23.667
We're going to keep Bierko
and his men out of here,

00:23.734 --> 00:25.134
so you can finish this.

00:28.001 --> 00:29.433

CHLOE:
<i>Ten seconds to launch.</i>

00:31.701 --> 00:33.000
( <i>computer beeping</i> )

00:33.067 --> 00:34.701
It's done.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.234
( <i>over radio</i> ):
The launch sequence is canceled.

00:37.301 --> 00:40.434
You were never really
going to let me go, were you?

00:40.501 --> 00:42.668
JACK:
<i>No.</i>

00:42.734 --> 00:43.867
( <i>gun clicks</i> )

00:43.933 --> 00:45.601
You were responsible
for the deaths

00:45.668 --> 00:48.668
of David Palmer
and Tony Almeida

00:48.734 --> 00:50.200
and Michelle Dessler.

00:52.867 --> 00:54.167
I'm going after Logan.

00:54.234 --> 00:56.301
What do you mean,
"going after Logan"?

00:56.367 --> 00:58.234
<i>I'll fill you in</i>
<i>on the details later.</i>

00:58.301 --> 00:59.634
Right now, I need you
to walk me through

00:59.701 --> 01:01.534
modifying some field
communications equipment.

01:01.601 --> 01:03.900
Who is this guy?
Morris O'Brian,
Chloe's ex-husband.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.167
I need some com unit
modifications.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.534
Can you do that
without talking?

01:07.601 --> 01:10.334
I could, but it would be
a terrible waste of my charm.

01:10.401 --> 01:12.234
Jack Bauer's on
his way here now.

01:12.301 --> 01:14.867
<i>He's going to confront</i>
<i>your husband directly.</i>

01:14.933 --> 01:17.367
But Charles is leaving
for the airfield immediately.

01:17.434 --> 01:20.567
You have to find
a way to stall him.

01:20.634 --> 01:23.100
There's a helicopter
waiting for me.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.000
Let it wait.
I can't.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.067
Yes, you can.

01:27.134 --> 01:29.301
You're the president.

01:31.334 --> 01:32.768
Aaron said
the recording you had

01:32.833 --> 01:34.900
implicating the president
was destroyed.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.401
Yes.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.067
NOVICK:
<i>Without it, you can't</i>
<i>mount a case.</i>

01:38.134 --> 01:39.534
I'm working with someone
inside CTU.

01:39.601 --> 01:41.000
They're setting up
a digital uplink.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.234
If I can get Logan
to acknowledge

01:42.301 --> 01:43.467
everything that he's done today,

01:43.534 --> 01:44.867
it's going to be
all the evidence we need.

01:44.933 --> 01:46.933
<i>I need to get on that chopper.</i>

01:47.000 --> 01:48.501
PIERCE:
<i>I don't see how that's</i>
<i>gonna be possible.</i>

01:48.567 --> 01:50.100
If Logan doesn't confess,

01:50.167 --> 01:52.234
how far are you actually
willing to go?

01:52.301 --> 01:54.501
As far as I have to.

Ah...

02:13.167 --> 02:14.567
Here, let me get
this for you.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.567
Watch your hair.

02:18.301 --> 02:20.234
Thank you.

02:22.434 --> 02:24.434
You're welcome.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.668
I got a flight suit.

02:29.734 --> 02:30.768
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

02:33.900 --> 02:35.267
Go ahead.

02:35.334 --> 02:37.567
Did you make it to the
Secret Service outbuilding?

02:37.634 --> 02:38.634
Yeah.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.134
I think Morris and I
may have a way

02:40.200 --> 02:41.401
to pull the copilot
from the flight.

02:41.467 --> 02:43.234
What about the
reassignment protocol?

02:43.301 --> 02:44.501
Working on it.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.768
Mike Novick will have
to verify the pilot codes.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.200
It should take him
about one minute.

02:48.267 --> 02:49.234
Chloe, hold on
a second.

02:49.301 --> 02:50.668
I'm switching over
to com.
Okay.

02:52.601 --> 02:54.134
Do you copy?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.634
Yeah.

02:55.701 --> 02:58.000
I'll get back to you as soon
as I'm on the chopper.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.067
Mike Novick's
going to call.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.100
Morris.

03:05.167 --> 03:06.933
Yes, sweetheart?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.167
I need you to do
one more thing.

03:14.167 --> 03:15.833
Some guy from Central
just called.

03:15.900 --> 03:16.867
Says your packet's
messed up.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.234
I got that
straightened out Monday.

03:18.301 --> 03:19.367
I guess not.

03:19.434 --> 03:20.800
He wants to
talk to you.
Now?

03:20.867 --> 03:22.501
Right now. He had
me patch you through

03:22.567 --> 03:24.401
to the Secret
Service outbuilding.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.067
Mike.

03:44.134 --> 03:45.634
I've delayed him
as long as I can.

03:45.701 --> 03:46.867
He'll be there in a few minutes.

03:46.933 --> 03:48.467
Have you heard anything
from Jack Bauer yet?

03:48.534 --> 03:49.833
He should be in
the Secret Service

03:49.900 --> 03:53.167
outbuilding. I'm sending him
the necessary documents now.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.800
There's not much time.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.067
I understand.

04:04.234 --> 04:05.734
( <i>dialing</i> )

04:05.800 --> 04:08.334
PIERCE:
Yeah, Mike.
The reassignment protocol

04:08.401 --> 04:11.467
and authorization
should be coming through to you.

04:11.534 --> 04:12.601
He'll need both.

04:12.668 --> 04:13.967
How are we
doing for time?

04:14.034 --> 04:15.034
Hurry.

04:36.501 --> 04:38.301
Hello.

04:38.367 --> 04:39.434
Hello.

04:39.501 --> 04:40.933
John.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.334
Aaron.

04:42.401 --> 04:44.367
I thought you transferred out.

04:44.434 --> 04:45.601
Not quite yet.

04:45.668 --> 04:46.900
Some guy from
Central called,

04:46.967 --> 04:48.534
said my packet's
all messed...

04:48.601 --> 04:50.234
( <i>groaning</i> )

04:57.200 --> 04:59.134
Don't worry
about him.

05:47.334 --> 05:50.200
Carruth has been relieved.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.167
I guess there was something
wrong with his packet.

05:54.534 --> 05:55.467
Ron Franklin.

05:55.534 --> 05:56.967
There's my protocol.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.067
This is not bad,

06:10.134 --> 06:12.200
but it needs to
be more positive,

06:12.267 --> 06:13.401
like, uh...

06:13.467 --> 06:15.634
Jack Bauer is
on the helicopter.

06:15.701 --> 06:17.301
You have to find an excuse

06:17.367 --> 06:19.401
not to get on board.

06:19.467 --> 06:23.467
LOGAN:
Um... Carolyn, do you
have the itinerary?

06:25.534 --> 06:26.734
MARTHA:
Charles?

06:26.833 --> 06:29.000
Excuse me. Could
I talk to you

06:29.067 --> 06:30.967
for a second?
Absolutely.

06:31.034 --> 06:33.434
Will you excuse us
for a second?

06:33.501 --> 06:34.867
I know it sounds silly,

06:34.933 --> 06:36.134
but I didn't bring
my medication.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.401
and I just, I just want
to have it with me.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.634
Of course. Of course.
We'll send

06:39.701 --> 06:41.067
somebody
back for it.
No, no, no.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.701
I don't want to delay you.

06:42.768 --> 06:44.167
I'll be along later.
Besides, Charles,

06:44.234 --> 06:46.567
I-I'm thinking that
when you land,

06:46.634 --> 06:47.567
it would be better

06:47.634 --> 06:48.567
if I wasn't with you.

06:48.634 --> 06:49.501
Why?

06:49.567 --> 06:51.134
This is <i>your</i> moment, Charles.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.034
I-I think that...

06:54.100 --> 06:56.634
when you step out
of that helicopter alone,

06:56.701 --> 06:59.034
after saving the country,

06:59.100 --> 07:03.334
that is an image that
history will never forget.

07:10.501 --> 07:13.601
All right.

07:13.668 --> 07:16.601
Thank you, Marti.

07:19.301 --> 07:20.234
But don't be

07:20.301 --> 07:21.267
far behind me, now.

07:21.334 --> 07:22.501
I won't.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.000
Thank you.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.134
Captain.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.768
I can fly this thing
if I have to,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.367
which leaves you
with one of two choices.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.234
You either do what I say and you
live, or you don't

08:25.301 --> 08:28.601
and you die for nothing.
You understand me?

08:28.668 --> 08:32.267
I want you to wait until
I give you my command, then

08:32.333 --> 08:34.501
follow these
instructions slowly.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.234
You're going to disconnect
your helmet from

08:36.301 --> 08:37.734
the communications system.
Then I want you

08:37.799 --> 08:38.967
to rip out the mic cable,

08:39.034 --> 08:41.467
take your helmet off
and stow it.

08:44.867 --> 08:46.167
Do it now.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.100
I'll know if you deviate
from your flight plan.

08:58.100 --> 09:00.668
Mr. President!

09:00.734 --> 09:02.967
I have a message for you
from the White House!

09:03.034 --> 09:04.833
( <i>Taser buzzing</i> )

09:04.900 --> 09:06.668
LOGAN:
What the hell are you doing?!

09:06.734 --> 09:08.701
Put these on!

09:13.034 --> 09:14.067
You.

09:14.134 --> 09:16.234
This is Jack.
Do you copy?

09:16.301 --> 09:18.334
I'm here, Jack.
Where are you?

09:18.401 --> 09:21.234
We just left the ranch.
I have Logan with me.

09:21.301 --> 09:23.067
Is Morris standing by
with the equipment?

09:23.134 --> 09:25.000
He's on his way. I'll
let him know you're airborne.

09:25.067 --> 09:27.501
Make sure the pilot
takes heading 2-8-6

09:27.567 --> 09:28.933
for two miles,
then breaks south.

09:29.000 --> 09:29.967
Captain!

09:30.034 --> 09:32.833
I want you to follow
heading 2-8-6

09:32.900 --> 09:34.800
for two miles,
then break south.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.134
Once you break south, there
should be an industrial park.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.634
There's an abandoned
printing press facility

09:38.701 --> 09:39.668
that you can use.

09:39.734 --> 09:40.734
I'll get back to you.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.734
Copy that.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.200
What are you
trying to do, Jack?

09:46.267 --> 09:49.100
Whatever it is,
you know you won't

09:49.167 --> 09:52.301
get away with it.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.467
Are you going to kill me?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.367
I suppose you want
some sort of revenge.

10:02.434 --> 10:05.167
I understand that.

10:05.234 --> 10:07.134
Bad things happened.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.933
I didn't want them to happen.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.900
People who worked for me--
they-they went too far.

10:10.967 --> 10:12.200
They did things
that they thought

10:12.267 --> 10:14.668
I wanted them to do,
but they were wrong.

10:17.734 --> 10:19.167
You have to understand.

10:19.234 --> 10:20.567
I have always

10:20.634 --> 10:23.900
acted in the country's
best interest.

10:23.967 --> 10:26.067
But you're just trying
to get even.

10:26.134 --> 10:28.467
Do you realize

10:28.534 --> 10:31.034
what effect this will have
on the American people?

10:31.100 --> 10:33.668
This day has been trying enough,

10:33.734 --> 10:37.501
and now the President
is being attacked.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.434
If you want
to do what's right,

10:39.501 --> 10:42.734
you will turn this
thing around and go back.

10:45.933 --> 10:48.900
Damn it, Bauer, say something!

10:51.034 --> 10:51.967
( <i>phone rings</i> )

10:52.034 --> 10:53.234
Hello.

10:53.301 --> 10:54.267
Morris.

10:54.334 --> 10:55.567
Yes, love.

10:55.634 --> 10:57.434
The helicopter is landing
in an industrial park

10:57.501 --> 10:59.434
one mile due east
of where you are.

10:59.501 --> 11:01.067
Head over there.

11:01.134 --> 11:03.401
Okay, now, I give this guy
what we worked on,

11:03.467 --> 11:04.668
and then I'm out, right?

11:04.734 --> 11:06.768
Yes, but make sure
you have him call me

11:06.833 --> 11:08.167
when you do
the hand-off.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.467
All right.
Thanks.

11:18.501 --> 11:19.534
Shut it down!

11:41.967 --> 11:44.800
Come on. Move!

11:53.501 --> 11:56.401
( <i>panting</i> )

12:03.267 --> 12:04.267
Come on.

12:06.134 --> 12:07.401
Move inside. Go.

12:19.601 --> 12:21.234
Jack, maybe we can work
something out.

12:21.301 --> 12:22.234
There's still time.

12:22.301 --> 12:24.334
What do you want?

12:24.401 --> 12:26.034
I can help you
get away from here

12:26.100 --> 12:27.800
with enough money
to start a new life,

12:27.867 --> 12:30.100
maybe find that daughter
of yours.

12:30.167 --> 12:32.067
Try to work something out.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.833
Whatever you want,
it's yours.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.100
You have my word.

12:37.167 --> 12:38.768
Your word.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.833
Jack, I'm the President
of the United States.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.967
I'm not, I'm not
carrying any weapons.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.367
( <i>keys jingle</i> )

13:06.467 --> 13:07.634
( <i>door opens</i> )

13:09.967 --> 13:12.267
Don't you make a sound.

13:23.601 --> 13:24.634
Hey.

13:30.833 --> 13:31.800
Give me the case.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.200
Jack Bauer.

13:33.267 --> 13:35.234
I should have known that.

13:35.301 --> 13:37.234
Modified equipment.

13:37.301 --> 13:38.734
Yeah.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.034
Oh, that's President Logan,
Jack.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.067
Get out of here.

13:46.134 --> 13:48.200
Yeah.
Chloe wants you to call her.

13:48.267 --> 13:49.768
Go.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.567
( <i>phone rings</i> )

13:57.634 --> 13:58.601
Yeah, Jack?

13:58.668 --> 13:59.601
I have him.

13:59.668 --> 14:00.800
All right.

14:00.867 --> 14:02.301
I've just checked
the response deployment.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.768
You have less than ten minutes
until they're on you.

14:04.833 --> 14:05.800
Fine.

14:05.867 --> 14:07.467
Listen, Jack.

14:07.534 --> 14:09.567
I don't mean to put
any added pressure on you,

14:09.634 --> 14:11.434
but if you don't have
a confession by then,

14:11.501 --> 14:12.933
we'll all be arrested
for treason.

14:29.734 --> 14:31.500
Is this some kind
of broadcast?

14:32.567 --> 14:35.034
What is this?

14:35.101 --> 14:37.901
I would like to know.
Is this an assassination?

14:37.967 --> 14:39.600
A confession.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.201
Don't count on it.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.067
I know you're good
at extracting information.

14:46.134 --> 14:47.767
I know that you're good
at torture.

14:47.834 --> 14:49.567
I saw what you did
with Walt Cummings.

14:49.634 --> 14:51.700
I think you'll be
surprised to find out

14:51.767 --> 14:54.001
that I'm a little tougher
than that.

14:54.067 --> 14:56.034
Take a seat.

14:56.101 --> 14:58.400
Chloe, it's Jack.
Can you hear me?

14:58.467 --> 14:59.567
Yeah, Jack.

14:59.634 --> 15:01.634
I want to make sure that
you have good reception.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.834
Who you talking to?
Are those your
friends at CTU?

15:03.901 --> 15:07.967
You know you're putting them
in danger, as well.

15:08.034 --> 15:09.333
Coming through
fine, Jack.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.500
Okay, good.

15:10.567 --> 15:12.600
My people can't be
far behind, Jack.

15:14.634 --> 15:17.567
There's still time to get away.
Take it.

15:17.634 --> 15:21.201
The plan involving the Sentox
nerve gas,

15:21.268 --> 15:24.567
it was designed
to fool the terrorists
and the Russians.

15:24.634 --> 15:27.067
Whether or not you formulated
the plan is irrelevant.

15:27.134 --> 15:28.734
You authorized it.
You're delusional.

15:28.801 --> 15:31.500
David Palmer uncovered
evidence of this plan.

15:31.567 --> 15:34.700
When he started
asking questions,
he was assassinated.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.867
Other people were killed
to cover that murder up.

15:36.934 --> 15:39.467
Men and women who served this
country with distinction;

15:39.534 --> 15:41.101
people that I worked with;
friends of mine.

15:41.168 --> 15:42.433
No, you're wrong.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.901
This is all a pack of lies.

15:43.967 --> 15:45.567
The terrorists discovered
your deception.

15:45.634 --> 15:49.700
And they deployed
Sentox nerve gas
on American soil.

15:49.767 --> 15:51.101
Every American
who died today

15:51.168 --> 15:52.934
as a result
of terrorist activity

15:53.001 --> 15:57.767
is another murder that
you're accountable for.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.467
And before you leave here,
you're going to admit it.

16:02.067 --> 16:04.268
I suppose if you hurt me
enough, Jack,

16:04.333 --> 16:06.134
I'll say whatever you want,

16:06.201 --> 16:07.801
but that won't make it
the truth.

16:07.867 --> 16:13.101
And everybody who watches this
will know that perfectly well.

16:13.168 --> 16:15.467
What are the names
of your co-conspirators?

16:15.534 --> 16:17.567
There are no co-conspirators,
because there is no...

16:17.634 --> 16:18.567
Walt Cummings,

16:18.634 --> 16:20.134
Christopher Henderson,

16:20.201 --> 16:22.034
James Nathanson
have all admitted

16:22.101 --> 16:23.867
to being part
of this conspiracy!

16:23.934 --> 16:25.268
Now they are dead!

16:25.333 --> 16:27.034
Right before
Christopher Henderson died

16:27.101 --> 16:28.500
he acknowledged that
there were others!

16:28.567 --> 16:30.300
What are their names?!

16:30.367 --> 16:32.467
A man will say anything
under torture.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.268
This won't mean a thing.

16:34.333 --> 16:37.534
Mr. Logan, I'm not going
to torture you,

16:37.600 --> 16:42.600
but you are going
to tell me what
I want to know.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.333
Or so help me God,

16:44.400 --> 16:46.034
I will kill you.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.800
A year and a half ago,

17:09.867 --> 17:12.034
I was warned
that my life was in danger

17:12.101 --> 17:16.134
by someone within
the government.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.700
I was told the only
way I could stay alive

17:18.767 --> 17:21.367
was to create the illusion
that I was dead.

17:21.433 --> 17:24.534
I was forced to deceive
people that I loved.

17:24.599 --> 17:27.433
My only daughter
will never forgive me.

17:31.034 --> 17:33.567
As I see the depth
of your corruption unfold,

17:33.634 --> 17:38.600
I have no doubt
that you are that
source of danger.

17:38.667 --> 17:40.333
David Palmer
was a great man.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.967
And he was
a great president.

17:43.034 --> 17:46.168
He was also my friend.

17:46.234 --> 17:48.667
He tried to warn me
about you

17:48.734 --> 17:50.333
and now he is dead.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.667
Other people tried
to help me

17:51.734 --> 17:52.901
and they are dead, too.

17:52.967 --> 17:57.767
So, Mr. Logan, I hope
you understand

17:57.834 --> 18:01.067
I have absolutely
nothing to lose.

18:01.134 --> 18:03.467
You are going
to be held accountable

18:03.534 --> 18:05.567
for your part
of everything that
happened today.

18:05.634 --> 18:07.767
You are not going to be able
to hide behind the presidency.

18:07.834 --> 18:09.333
Right here, right now,

18:09.400 --> 18:11.801
you are going
to face justice!

18:11.867 --> 18:14.134
And make no mistake
about this, this
is personal.

18:14.201 --> 18:15.634
And if you think
for a second

18:15.700 --> 18:18.201
that I am scared
to put a bullet
in your brain,

18:18.268 --> 18:20.634
you don't know me.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.567
I'm going to ask you
one last time,

18:26.634 --> 18:31.134
who are your
co-conspirators?

18:31.201 --> 18:33.901
You have until
the count of three,

18:33.967 --> 18:35.901
or I will kill you.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.600
One...

18:37.667 --> 18:39.901
You make me a martyr, I'll go
down in history with Lincoln

18:39.967 --> 18:41.867
and Kennedy, but you'll go down
with John Wilkes Booth

18:41.934 --> 18:43.634
and Lee Harvey Oswald.
Is that what you want?

18:43.700 --> 18:44.433
Two!

18:44.500 --> 18:47.300
You're a man of honor.

18:47.367 --> 18:51.168
How can you assassinate
a president of the
United States

18:51.234 --> 18:52.834
in front
of the entire world?

18:52.901 --> 18:55.300
If you love your country,
you won't pull the trigger.

18:55.367 --> 18:56.168
Three!

19:06.234 --> 19:07.400
( <i>gasping</i> )

19:19.433 --> 19:21.034
You can't do it, can you?

19:21.101 --> 19:23.667
No, Jack,
it's all right.

19:23.734 --> 19:27.767
Jack, it's all right.
It's all right.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.234
It's all right that you can't.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.534
I'm the president.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.534
Jack, they're here.

20:06.234 --> 20:08.534
AGENT:
Lay flat on your stomach!

20:08.600 --> 20:10.234
Put your hands
out in front of you!

20:10.300 --> 20:11.801
Extend your arms!

20:16.168 --> 20:17.567
Mr. President,
are you all right?

20:17.634 --> 20:19.101
I'm fine.

20:19.168 --> 20:20.767
I actually feel sorry
for that man.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.534
He's delusional.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.834
It would be better
if he were put

20:24.901 --> 20:26.234
in some sort
of solitary confinement

20:26.300 --> 20:27.400
for the time being.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.534
Jack Bauer

21:11.601 --> 21:14.034
wasn't able to get
the President to confess,

21:14.100 --> 21:15.167
Mrs. Logan.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.267
I'm sorry.

21:16.334 --> 21:18.233
Why not?
What happened?

21:18.300 --> 21:20.500
I'm not sure
of the details.

21:20.567 --> 21:22.801
Bauer's in custody.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.100
Gentlemen.

21:48.267 --> 21:49.634
Thank you.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.467
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:08.534 --> 22:09.634
That will be all.
Thank you so much.

22:09.701 --> 22:10.834
If I could just get you

22:10.901 --> 22:14.767
to come this way. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

David...

23:02.634 --> 23:03.934
( <i>cries</i> )

23:04.001 --> 23:06.601
Marti, don't
do this to me now.
You killed him.

23:06.667 --> 23:07.934
You killed him.

23:08.001 --> 23:09.233
You're a murderer.
Stop.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.200
You are!
You're a criminal!

23:11.267 --> 23:13.200
My wife is not well.

23:13.267 --> 23:15.367
Would you please
escort her?
Get off me!

23:15.434 --> 23:17.133
Don't you touch me!

23:17.200 --> 23:18.734
Don't you touch me!
Escort her into
the hangar, please.

23:18.801 --> 23:21.601
You don't know what he did!
He's not fit to be president!

23:21.667 --> 23:26.367
It is a sacrilege for him to be
even speaking David's name!

23:26.434 --> 23:27.434
Don't...!

23:27.500 --> 23:28.667
No!

23:31.867 --> 23:34.601
I want to make sure
that she's all right.

23:38.801 --> 23:39.767
Has the hangar
been cleared?

23:39.834 --> 23:41.167
Yes, sir.
All secure.

23:41.233 --> 23:42.834
It's empty.
Good.

23:42.901 --> 23:45.100
Let them know that
I'll be back in a moment.

23:45.167 --> 23:46.734
Yes, Mr. President.

23:54.334 --> 23:57.100
( <i>moaning</i> )

23:57.167 --> 23:59.834
You're not wearing some kind
of listening device, are you?

23:59.901 --> 24:02.400
What are you
talking about?

24:02.467 --> 24:05.300
I have to watch you
now, Marti.

24:05.367 --> 24:06.901
You said that
I was a good liar,

24:06.968 --> 24:09.534
but I am nothing
compared to you.

24:09.601 --> 24:11.367
Charles...! Stop it!

24:11.434 --> 24:12.534
Stop it!

24:20.634 --> 24:22.667
Charles...
Aah!
Yeah, Marti.

24:22.734 --> 24:24.500
Tell me the truth.

24:24.567 --> 24:25.901
You're hurting me.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.834
You don't know
what pain is.

24:30.901 --> 24:31.968
I'm on to you, Marti.

24:32.034 --> 24:34.100
I should've seen it
from the first,

24:34.167 --> 24:36.867
but I wanted to believe
that you still cared for me.

24:36.934 --> 24:41.334
Making love to me was
just a ploy, wasn't it?

24:43.334 --> 24:44.968
Took a lot of planning

24:45.034 --> 24:46.867
to get Jack Bauer
on that helicopter.

24:46.934 --> 24:48.601
You were part of
that plan, weren't you?

24:48.667 --> 24:52.200
It was your job
to delay me, wasn't it?

24:52.267 --> 24:54.400
Wasn't it?!

24:54.467 --> 24:56.034
Please...

24:56.100 --> 24:57.068
Wasn't it?!

24:57.133 --> 24:58.200
They used you

24:58.267 --> 25:00.300
so Jack Bauer
could get to me.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.334
Come on, Marti.
Come on, Marti.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.834
Admit it,
you were part of it.

25:03.901 --> 25:06.267
Yes. Yes.

25:08.100 --> 25:10.100
Why?

25:10.167 --> 25:11.801
Why...?

25:11.867 --> 25:13.267
Why did you help them?

25:13.334 --> 25:17.701
Because you killed
David Palmer.

25:17.767 --> 25:21.100
I told you I didn't realize
that was going to happen.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.467
Your people killed him
to protect you.

25:24.534 --> 25:26.167
You covered it up,
that's just as bad.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.300
I covered it up
because I had to.

25:28.367 --> 25:30.233
Oh, and then others
died to cover that up.

25:30.300 --> 25:31.934
That's right, for
the good of the country.

25:32.001 --> 25:34.601
You sold nerve gas
to terrorists.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.701
You're insane.

25:36.767 --> 25:38.400
You're insane!
I did it

25:38.467 --> 25:41.834
for the good of the country
as I saw it at the time.

25:45.233 --> 25:47.601
You're such a hypocrite.

25:49.434 --> 25:51.634
After your little
performance this morning,

25:51.701 --> 25:54.434
you're in no position
to call me a hypocrite.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.434
And I will tell you
something else--

25:56.500 --> 25:58.834
if you blow up like this
one more time...

25:58.901 --> 26:01.901
I will fill you
so full of drugs,

26:01.968 --> 26:04.233
you won't even remember
your own name.

26:04.300 --> 26:07.667
And then I will ship you
off to an asylum

26:07.734 --> 26:10.567
and you can stay there
for the rest of your life.

26:12.068 --> 26:14.334
Are we clear?

26:17.601 --> 26:20.100
Are we clear?

27:22.133 --> 27:24.966
My fellow Americans,

27:25.033 --> 27:28.433
this has been a terrible day
in the history of this country--

27:28.500 --> 27:32.733
and yet at the same time,
a triumphant day,

27:32.799 --> 27:35.966
because in the end,
we won a significant victory

27:36.033 --> 27:40.333
over the forces of chaos
and terror.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.500
We have preserved and protected
our way of life,

27:42.567 --> 27:46.833
despite the loss
of innocent American lives.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.233
I'll start the transmission

27:48.300 --> 27:50.367
in one minute.
Is the Attorney General there?

27:50.433 --> 27:52.333
I'm here, Ms. O'Brian.
I certainly hope

27:52.400 --> 27:55.233
this recording is as important
as you claim it is.

27:59.100 --> 28:00.433
Chloe, what's this about?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.367
I set up
a conference call with

28:02.433 --> 28:03.966
the Attorney General.
He's on speakerphone now.

28:04.033 --> 28:05.033
Are you serious?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.267
I'm very serious.

28:06.333 --> 28:08.200
Mr. Attorney General,
this is Karen Hayes,

28:08.267 --> 28:11.534
Homeland Security.
Bill Buchanan, CTU.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.699
Sir, I apologize. Ms. O'Brian
placed this call without

28:13.766 --> 28:15.733
authorization from me.
I'm sorry I had to do that.

28:15.799 --> 28:17.233
We had to do things
under the radar

28:17.300 --> 28:19.367
to protect you all in case
things went wrong.

28:19.433 --> 28:20.966
In case what things
went wrong?

28:21.033 --> 28:23.500
I think it would help
if I just played the recording.

28:23.567 --> 28:24.933
HAYES:
What recording?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.534
It's a conversation that took
place five minutes ago

28:27.600 --> 28:28.766
between the President
and his wife.

28:28.833 --> 28:30.033
How could you

28:30.100 --> 28:32.799
possibly have a recording
of something like that?

28:32.866 --> 28:35.100
Sir, an agent named Jack Bauer
placed a listening device

28:35.167 --> 28:37.534
on the President shortly
before this conversation.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.233
Bauer? Isn't he the one
that's under arrest?

28:40.300 --> 28:42.200
CHLOE:
I'm going to play
the recording now.

28:42.267 --> 28:43.733
I don't want
to listen to it.

28:43.799 --> 28:45.799
Ms. O'Brian, at the very least,
this constitutes

28:45.866 --> 28:47.766
an egregious violation
of privacy,

28:47.833 --> 28:49.400
and we're talking about
the President.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.933
MARTHA ( <i>sobbing</i> ):
...'cause you killed
David Palmer.

28:52.000 --> 28:56.866
LOGAN:
I told you, I didn't realize
that was going to happen.

28:56.933 --> 28:59.433
Your people killed him
to protect you.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.300
You covered it up,
that's just as bad.

29:01.367 --> 29:03.567
I covered it up
because I had to.

29:03.634 --> 29:05.699
Oh, and then others
died to cover that up!

29:05.766 --> 29:07.900
That's right, for
the good of the country.

29:07.966 --> 29:09.500
You sold nerve gas
to terrorists.

29:09.567 --> 29:12.400
You're insane.
You're insane!

29:12.467 --> 29:16.033
A poet once said,
"No man is an island."

29:16.100 --> 29:20.966
On a day like this, we can feel
the truth of those words.

29:21.033 --> 29:23.100
Any untimely death is a tragedy.

29:23.167 --> 29:27.033
Yet some men embody such
greatness of character

29:27.100 --> 29:30.500
that their death
serves as a unifying force

29:30.567 --> 29:34.133
for those who remain behind.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.634
David Palmer was such a man.

29:36.699 --> 29:41.000
A great President,
a great American--

29:41.066 --> 29:47.100
and on a more personal note--
a wonderful friend.

29:47.167 --> 29:49.400
He'll be missed...
( <i>cell phone rings</i> )

29:49.467 --> 29:51.634
...more than words
can express...
Holtzman.

29:51.699 --> 29:53.333
Yes, sir.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.833
We take this moment to
remember with appreciation...

29:55.900 --> 29:57.833
With all due respect,
Mr. Attorney General,

29:57.900 --> 30:01.133
are you sure this isn't
some kind of mistake?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.567
Yes, sir.

30:04.634 --> 30:05.833
I understand, sir.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.300
I'll do exactly as you say.

30:08.367 --> 30:11.666
LOGAN:
...combination of wisdom,
strength and moral courage,

30:11.733 --> 30:16.167
this country might have not
survived in its present form.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.100
It's very appropriate that David
Palmer will be laid to rest

30:27.167 --> 30:28.400
in Arlington Cemetery,

30:28.467 --> 30:33.033
for he was a soldier
in the truest sense.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.100
He was a man whose courage rose
in direct proportion

30:38.167 --> 30:41.500
to the threats
his country faced.

30:49.100 --> 30:54.167
In closing, I would ask
that the country

30:54.233 --> 30:56.634
observe a national day
of mourning

30:56.699 --> 30:58.666
for one of
the greatest Americans

30:58.733 --> 31:02.000
this nation will ever see.

31:02.066 --> 31:03.733
Thank you very much.

31:03.799 --> 31:05.866
( <i>applause</i> )

31:08.666 --> 31:10.433
( <i>mouthing</i> )

31:10.500 --> 31:12.733
Federal marshall.
Would you please
come with us?

31:12.799 --> 31:14.467
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

31:14.534 --> 31:16.367
You came very close
to disrupting my speech.

31:16.433 --> 31:18.167
BROWN:
On behalf of President Logan,

31:18.233 --> 31:22.033
I wish to thank you all
very much for joining us.

31:24.033 --> 31:26.033
I am sorry, but out of respect
for today's...

31:26.100 --> 31:28.200
Those are ridiculous
accusations.

31:28.267 --> 31:31.933
Excuse me.
If I may, sir?

31:33.367 --> 31:36.400
You've probably never seen
one of these, Mr. President.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.500
It's a micro-transmitter.

32:08.733 --> 32:09.933
Agent Clark, arrest these men

32:10.000 --> 32:11.600
and get them the hell
out of here.

32:11.666 --> 32:13.267
I'm sorry.
Mr. President.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.300
We have our orders.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.100
You take...!

32:16.167 --> 32:17.666
You take your orders
from me.

32:17.733 --> 32:19.433
Not anymore.

32:21.367 --> 32:23.500
After you, sir.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.133
OFFICER:
Attention!

32:46.200 --> 32:47.500
Aim, fire!

32:47.567 --> 32:49.433
( <i>rifles firing</i> )

32:49.500 --> 32:51.367
OFFICER:
Attention!

32:51.433 --> 32:52.600
Aim,

32:52.666 --> 32:53.733
fire!

32:56.766 --> 32:57.233
Attention!

32:57.300 --> 32:58.133
Aim,

32:58.200 --> 32:59.933
fire!

33:00.000 --> 33:03.799
Present arms.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.534
Sir.

33:35.766 --> 33:37.333
Give me a second.

33:56.267 --> 33:57.500
Hey.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.433
Hey.

34:01.433 --> 34:03.733
Thank God you're safe.

34:03.799 --> 34:05.833
Everything's going
to be all right.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.600
Jack, when I heard
you kidnapped the
President...

34:07.666 --> 34:10.900
I was just trying
to get him to give me
a direct confession.

34:12.733 --> 34:13.966
Jack...

34:17.167 --> 34:19.233
How much longer
do you need to stay here?

34:21.467 --> 34:24.567
Not much longer. They can
debrief me tomorrow.

34:24.634 --> 34:26.000
You sure?

34:42.900 --> 34:45.100
I can't believe
you're really,

34:45.167 --> 34:47.300
you're really here.

34:49.733 --> 34:52.167
Agent Bauer,

34:52.233 --> 34:54.132
excuse me, but there's
a call for you

34:54.199 --> 34:55.132
from your daughter.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.433
From my daughter?

34:56.500 --> 34:57.900
Yes, sir. A Kim Bauer.
It's been put through

34:57.966 --> 34:59.799
to a land line
just inside that door.

34:59.866 --> 35:01.300
Thank you.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.133
I'll be right back.
I promise.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.400
Take as long
as you need.

35:09.467 --> 35:10.799
I'm not going anywhere.

35:13.200 --> 35:14.133
I love you.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.267
I'll be right back.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.467
Hey, Kim?

35:57.867 --> 35:59.500
Any word on Logan?

35:59.567 --> 36:03.133
No. My guess
is he'll try
to cut a deal.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.734
He'll resign
without a fight

36:04.800 --> 36:06.500
in exchange for clemency.

36:06.567 --> 36:07.901
He doesn't deserve clemency.

36:07.967 --> 36:09.333
No, but the country
doesn't deserve

36:09.400 --> 36:11.433
a long impeachment
process, either,

36:11.500 --> 36:13.433
with everything
that's happened.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.901
In any event, we can expect

36:15.967 --> 36:19.567
Hal Gordon to be sworn in
as president soon.

36:19.634 --> 36:21.500
Which means this
will probably be
the last time

36:21.567 --> 36:22.500
I see this place.

36:22.567 --> 36:24.233
I don't think so.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.166
Not if I have anything
to do with it,

36:26.233 --> 36:27.166
and I will.

36:27.233 --> 36:31.100
You'll be back here
running CTU.

36:31.166 --> 36:33.066
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

36:33.133 --> 36:37.700
When I came in here
last night to save the day,

36:37.767 --> 36:40.867
I was a little bit
condescending and tactless,

36:40.934 --> 36:43.700
to say the least.

36:43.767 --> 36:46.300
I had no idea
what you were up against.

36:46.367 --> 36:47.367
I'm sorry.

36:47.433 --> 36:49.600
No. No need to apologize.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.867
Mistakes were made.

36:50.934 --> 36:54.001
You were right to come
in with a firm hand.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.333
Well, I better go.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.700
Karen.

37:01.166 --> 37:04.667
I was thinking
of getting some breakfast

37:04.734 --> 37:06.166
before going home.

37:06.233 --> 37:09.934
I have to go over to Division
for one last briefing.

37:10.001 --> 37:11.100
Bureaucracy.

37:12.867 --> 37:14.634
Rain check?

37:14.700 --> 37:17.001
Sure.

37:35.767 --> 37:38.166
Chloe,

37:38.233 --> 37:40.200
really good work today.

37:40.267 --> 37:42.934
You, too.

37:45.734 --> 37:47.967
I found this
in Edgar's possessions.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.233
I thought you should
have it.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.467
Thanks.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.634
( <i>sniffles</i> )

38:15.901 --> 38:16.934
Hey.

38:18.433 --> 38:20.467
What's all
this, then?

38:22.467 --> 38:24.901
A friend of mine
who died today.

38:27.200 --> 38:32.433
You, um, do you
want to talk about it?

38:36.433 --> 38:37.600
Yeah? Come on.

38:50.534 --> 38:51.800
Jack?

38:59.634 --> 39:00.734
Oh, my God.

39:01.901 --> 39:04.267
Agent Davis,
Jack Bauer's missing!

39:04.333 --> 39:05.734
Attention, all units.

39:05.800 --> 39:07.233
We have a missing agent:
Jack Bauer.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.934
I repeat, we have
a missing agent: Jack Bauer.

39:10.001 --> 39:11.500
...the lower level.

39:11.567 --> 39:12.901
Put three men
on perimeter search.

39:12.967 --> 39:14.734
Report back.

39:19.166 --> 39:20.433
( <i>Jack grunts</i> )

39:56.367 --> 39:58.700
You surely must
be aware, Mr. Bauer,

39:58.767 --> 40:01.934
that China has a long memory.

40:02.001 --> 40:03.967
Only 18 months ago,

40:04.033 --> 40:05.934
you invaded
our territory

40:06.001 --> 40:08.700
and killed our consul.

40:16.800 --> 40:21.867
Did you really think
that we would forget, hmm?

40:24.667 --> 40:27.066
I know how this works.

40:30.133 --> 40:32.667
I need to make one phone call.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.934
Please...

40:40.567 --> 40:42.934
just one phone call.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.800
Kill me.

41:05.367 --> 41:06.400
Just...

41:08.767 --> 41:09.800
kill me.

41:09.867 --> 41:11.734
Kill you?

41:11.800 --> 41:15.534
You're far too valuable
to kill, Mr. Bauer.
