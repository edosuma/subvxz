00:02.127 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Justified...

00:03.586 --> 00:07.757
Drew Thompson shot Theo in the eye
and left him for dead on a runway in Panama.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.467
Mr Tonin would like you
to find Drew Thompson.

00:09.551 --> 00:10.843
Not a problem.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.554
We found Drew Thompson.
Turns out he's the Goddamn county sheriff.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.640
Find Shelby before anyone else does,

00:15.724 --> 00:18.893
or you can say goodbye to that dream
you have of displacing your cousin.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.520
$500,000?

00:20.604 --> 00:24.273
I'm about to give you
Drew goddamn Thompson on a silver platter.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.776
You want your man,
that's what it's gonna cost.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.902
I think your ride is here.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.492
The marshals got to Drew before Nicky could.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.618
What do we do?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.203
We make a case to Theo.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.454
Or?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.789
Or we run.

00:39.873 --> 00:40.915
So what's next?

00:40.999 --> 00:44.419
Theo Tonin knows we got Drew.
He's not gonna be too happy about that.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.630
We just got
to figure out how to get out of Harlan alive.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.978
Wouldn't happen to have
a rocket launcher, would you?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.312
Sadly, no.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.315
- I got Lexington Air Ops, Chief.
- All right.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.401
Tim, if that thing gets any closer, shoot it.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.654
Mullen here. Where the hell are you?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.741
Look at you, Mr. Crowder.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.702
You're a well-dressed man.
You got a sense of style.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.872
You got your shirt
buttoned all the way up to the top.

01:21.457 --> 01:22.874
I got to ask. Where'd you get all those teeth?

01:23.333 --> 01:25.126
Courtesy of the American taxpayer

01:25.210 --> 01:27.795
while serving
our great nation in Desert Storm.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.255
Man, I love the way you talk.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.424
Using 40 words where four will do.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.718
I'm curious.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.053
What would you say
if I was about to put 40 bullets through

01:36.138 --> 01:37.555
that beautiful vest of yours?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.140
"What're you waiting for?"

01:39.224 --> 01:40.641
You're cool, huh?

01:41.101 --> 01:45.146
I tried to keep it to four words.
You'll allow the contraction as one.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.732
Yolo.

01:52.738 --> 01:53.905
Again.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.536
You know who also didn't deliver?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.079
Wynn Duffy.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.167
But as you can see, he's not here.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.878
He had the sense to run and hide.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.176
But you stuck around. That's a bold move.

02:15.260 --> 02:20.723
Well, I wagered that you'd see that success
is in our mutual best interest.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.518
You believe in God?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.603
I do not.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.688
But this is Bible country, right?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.691
You know the story of Abraham and Isaac?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.485
I do.

02:32.569 --> 02:37.448
See, a lot of people are troubled by the fact
that God asked Abraham to do such a thing.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.201
But truth be told, God of the Old Testament...

02:40.285 --> 02:41.702
Kind of a dick.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.996
To me, the real question is Abraham.

02:44.081 --> 02:48.960
You know, why would he be willing to
entertain the idea of killing his son?

02:50.254 --> 02:53.339
Well, conventional wisdom is
he was demonstrating his own faith.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.216
I think that's wrong.

02:55.884 --> 03:00.263
I think Abraham thought
about killing his own son

03:00.347 --> 03:04.642
and was willing to kill his own son
because God told him to do it.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.810
God.

03:06.562 --> 03:08.813
And when the most
powerful being in the universe

03:08.897 --> 03:10.273
tells you to do something...

03:12.150 --> 03:13.484
You do it.

03:13.986 --> 03:17.905
And what has your God
told you to do, Mr. Augustine?

03:19.074 --> 03:21.033
Kill Drew Thompson.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.285
I see.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.414
Well, if you want Drew
Thompson, you'll need Raylan Givens.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.125
And if you want Raylan Givens,
you'll need me.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.751
And if you want me...

03:31.795 --> 03:35.047
I'm still gonna need $500,000.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.604
You're so glad you didn't ask for $2 million.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.648
How long was it in the wall?

03:53.191 --> 03:54.901
We moved here when I was 15.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.777
The house that cocaine built.

03:57.321 --> 03:59.739
So you kept Waldo's ID in a bag, huh?

04:00.532 --> 04:01.574
Like a trophy?

04:01.658 --> 04:04.035
Prove you're badass,
pulled off the feat of the century?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.829
No, it was more practical than that.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.749
I couldn't leave it in the plane,
couldn't throw it out.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.292
Someone would have found it.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.378
So you put it in a bag
and then gave that bag to Arlo?

04:14.463 --> 04:16.088
He said he'd burn it.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.091
Smell that? That's irony.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.305
Our guys are with LPD Air Ops,
fuelling the helicopter.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.098
It'll be wheels up in 15 minutes,

04:26.183 --> 04:27.934
another 30 minutes in flight time.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.685
We can't sit here for another hour.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.687
30 plus 15's 45.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.940
The better part of an hour.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.192
We don't know how many men Tonin's sent.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.861
You want the Battle of Bloody Porch?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.988
- The what?
- The Wild Bunch.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.033
Art, we got to move,
and we got to move soon.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.451
KSP's not ready.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.828
Got six units headed inbound.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.664
They'll meet us over the pass.

04:49.748 --> 04:50.790
Once we get to the highway,

04:50.874 --> 04:52.917
we can have those units leapfrog,
shut down the on-ramps.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.795
Go 80, 85, should make it
to Lexington in two hours.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.050
They're holed up at Raylan's daddy's home.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.426
Option one, you can hit them there.

05:02.511 --> 05:06.013
But it's in a defensible position,
on a hill, good sight lines.

05:06.098 --> 05:07.932
And you'd need at least a dozen men,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.267
heavy weapons,
and be okay losing half of them.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.812
Who is he, and why is he talking?

05:12.938 --> 05:15.815
Meet Colt.
We served together in Desert Storm.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.067
Picker, how many men you got coming?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.319
We got Rigo and three others.

05:20.404 --> 05:21.529
They should be here soon.

05:21.613 --> 05:22.989
Well, it won't be soon enough.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.825
Now, your man
in the air said he saw a tow truck,

05:25.909 --> 05:28.703
which means the marshals
can push cars out of the way if needed,

05:28.787 --> 05:32.957
which means Raylan Givens
intends on driving Drew out.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.626
They're fuelling up
a police helicopter in Lexington.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.169
This is the biggest case in Raylan's career.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.880
He will not wait on an airlift. He will drive.

05:40.382 --> 05:44.969
Now, he'll want to avoid towns and civilians,
which means he will take the pass.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.514
Now, your option two...
Really, your only option

05:48.598 --> 05:52.226
is to hit them right there.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.561
We send all our men there?

05:53.645 --> 05:55.896
Just one man. My man, Colt.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.566
Not alone.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.485
I could use a shooter, a good one.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.739
Colt? Mort.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.948
Mort, Colt.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.166
Here we go.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.293
At least I ain't gonna die today.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.215
What the hell?

07:05.926 --> 07:06.967
What are you doing?

07:07.969 --> 07:09.303
It's not right.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.846
What's not right?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.973
One abandoned car beside
the road is no big deal,

07:13.058 --> 07:15.351
but two so close together? That's weird.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.229
That's Kentucky.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.647
How about a third?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.819
What are you thinking, IEDs?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.154
I'm not thinking confetti cannons.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.407
Are you sure about this?

07:30.492 --> 07:33.202
For all I know,
I'm just having a full-blown PTSD episode.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.453
You get those a lot?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.914
Only when I'm handling firearms in public.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.082
What are we doing, guys?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.835
Pull up behind us,
and stay off the goddamn radio.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.469
Lexington ground crew. Air Ops just took off.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.806
We got 30 minutes. What do you say, Drew?

07:53.890 --> 07:57.268
Want to play some checkers,
watch reruns on TV?

07:57.352 --> 08:00.271
Well, I wouldn't mind changing out of this.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.397
Take a shower, maybe.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.732
Look good for the press?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.860
I want to look good when I go.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.778
We all know this is it for me.

08:07.863 --> 08:11.448
You ain't gonna shower.
You ain't gonna change. You ain't gonna die.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.908
We're good at what we do.

08:14.202 --> 08:19.206
Well, then I guess maybe I'd just like
to enjoy the view for a while.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.625
We have a view?

08:21.710 --> 08:22.877
How many years you live here?

08:23.587 --> 08:26.630
I kept my head down growing up,
or else nose in a book.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.215
You? A reader?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.719
Hardy Boys, Stephen King, whatever.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.096
There's no frigate like a book.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.972
Arlo.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.726
Did you know we met in Vietnam?

08:39.769 --> 08:40.977
Saigon.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.480
In front of a whorehouse on Tu Do Street.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.525
He was holding
a Louis L'Amour book in his hand.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.611
Don't sound like him.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.781
I thought, "Who the hell stands in front of
a whorehouse reading a book?"

08:53.658 --> 08:55.492
I started to bust his chops.

08:56.286 --> 08:59.914
Turned out some
boonie rat in his unit had slipped him LSD.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.125
He was trying
to find the guy's name in the book

09:03.251 --> 09:04.960
so he could castrate the bastard.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.879
That sounds like him.

09:08.048 --> 09:13.761
I talked him down. Took a few hours,
but, hell, I'd already been laid.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.180
We hit it off.

09:16.264 --> 09:19.308
He told me
to look him up if I ever got in a jam.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.395
That's what's on your mind in what you see
as the last moments of your life?

09:24.481 --> 09:26.357
You asked me, son.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.317
Now you don't want to talk about it.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.777
Don't even want a quiet moment

09:29.861 --> 09:31.737
where you might even
think about your daddy.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.323
Is that it? Is that why I can't enjoy the view?

09:34.407 --> 09:36.408
If I thought you were
doing anything other than trying

09:36.493 --> 09:38.953
to figure a way out, I'd give you some peace.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.623
I'm done running, Raylan.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.500
A leopard don't change its spots, Drew.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.461
- What's up, Art?
- Raylan, we've stopped down.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.046
Tim's feeling a setup.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.172
You think you've been blown?

09:50.882 --> 09:52.007
It could be.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.803
I think you should peel off right now,
go to the alt.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.638
Will do.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.014
Contact Air Ops. We got to move.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.684
Let's go. Come on.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.939
I have the cowboy in the follow car.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.191
Marshal driving the SUV.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.986
Looks like a statey in the truck.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.570
No sign of Drew?

10:13.697 --> 10:15.072
Too much tint.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.949
They could have him in a trunk.

10:17.033 --> 10:18.867
Give them a minute, see if they move.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.913
Well, what do we do? We go back?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.791
Not if the car
behind us is filled with high explosives.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.042
And you think it is?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.711
I think so.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.421
How could they pull this off?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.924
Boyd has an Iraq
and Afghan veteran in his crew.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.926
Colton Rhodes.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.845
Ex-M.P., drummed out for drugs.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.263
And you have his number?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.806
Our paths have crossed.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.731
- Yeah.
- Hello, Bagram.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.566
Well, hello, Deputy Dawg.

10:50.692 --> 10:51.900
Speaker.

10:52.027 --> 10:56.488
Am I right in saying that you were
in the sandbox before Afghanistan?

10:56.573 --> 10:58.824
I am a double winner.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.326
Is that why you called, to ask me that?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.493
Why? You busy?

11:01.578 --> 11:02.911
I am in the middle of something.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.330
All right, I'll make it quick.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.165
I'm writing a book set in Iraq.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.418
There's a chapter
where a convoy of military police

11:09.544 --> 11:12.421
is transporting a criminal,
and Lieutenant Dan,

11:12.547 --> 11:14.256
he's our main guy, he gets a bad feeling.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.424
Forrest Gump.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.093
There's a Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.678
Shit. You're right. I'll change it.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.597
Lieutenant Colt.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.850
I would like a young
Gerard Depardieu to play me in the movie.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.018
I'm honoured.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.604
Well, you should be.
He's a big guy, real badass.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.274
Or he was. He's kind of losing his grip.
When we meet him, he's lost someone.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.109
He started using dope that he confiscated.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.862
Yeah, but then we find out
that he's kicked again.

11:36.946 --> 11:41.116
And anyone who thinks he's in any way
diminished is in for a big surprise.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.452
Yeah, but he's the kind
of character might say he's kicked,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.788
but we all know
he's just one broken shoelace away

11:45.914 --> 11:47.956
from saying "screw it" and picking up again.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.959
How about you have him go
into a bar and pick a fight with some rangers,

11:51.044 --> 11:52.795
and he sends
a couple of them to the hospital?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.713
It's not a fantasy.

11:54.798 --> 11:58.550
Anyway, he gets a bad feeling
when they pass an abandoned vehicle,

11:58.635 --> 12:02.221
sees a second and a third,
so he's thinking IEDs triggered by cell.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.889
You ever come across anything like that?

12:03.973 --> 12:04.973
Me, personally?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.310
No. But I did hear about this one convoy,

12:08.395 --> 12:11.647
couple of Frankensteins
and a gun truck on Highway 10.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.484
So, the spotter,
he calls a halt between the first two cars.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.320
Thinking the hajis
will blow the second if it moves forward,

12:18.446 --> 12:20.239
and the first if it tries to go back.

12:20.323 --> 12:21.407
Well, how'd they get out of it?

12:21.491 --> 12:24.576
Yeah, they didn't.
Because they were too afraid to move.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.662
They just sat there in their vehicles.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.915
Pissing and shitting in their helmets,

12:29.999 --> 12:32.126
too afraid to toss it out the windows

12:32.210 --> 12:34.378
on account of possible snipers.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.131
Then they ran out of food.

12:37.215 --> 12:38.590
They started eating each other

12:38.675 --> 12:39.967
till there was only one left,

12:40.510 --> 12:41.969
and he blew his brains out.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.138
Do you want to know the sad part?

12:44.222 --> 12:46.348
- There's a sad part?
- Yeah.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.976
Because they were so afraid to move,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.728
they never found out
whether or not the cars had explosives.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.482
So basically,
they all died from being pussies.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.613
They don't want to move?
We'll make them move.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.740
Shoot the back windows and sides,

13:03.867 --> 13:07.703
but do not shoot the drivers or the tyres.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.538
Got it?

13:10.665 --> 13:11.748
And now?

13:11.875 --> 13:15.377
Well, the good news is I'm not flashing back.
But now they're gonna try to make us move.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.212
- So what do we do?
- Move.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.736
Holy shit.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.241
They circled the wagons.

13:58.421 --> 13:59.755
You're sure?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.259
Well, all right, then.

14:05.428 --> 14:07.638
It's a decoy.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.097
You can't catch a break, can you?

14:09.224 --> 14:11.058
Well, I got the convoy right.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.352
It's just that the man
you're looking for ain't in it.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.772
Yeah. Right.
So now we're still looking for him.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.983
So, what's your solution?

14:20.109 --> 14:23.278
Just let me think.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.573
When did that helicopter
get up in Lexington?

14:27.408 --> 14:29.284
- Ten minutes ago.
- Awesome.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.954
Yolo, go to the old man's house.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.080
He won't be there.

14:33.164 --> 14:35.123
That's a comment, not a solution.

14:53.434 --> 14:57.020
Well, if I didn't think
I was in deep shit before, I do now.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.274
We ain't in deep shit
because my alma mater's a flawed redoubt.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.859
We're in deep shit because of you.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.237
Derelict High School
wouldn't have been my move.

15:05.321 --> 15:10.450
The fact is, all of this, trail of dead included,
is 'cause you wouldn't turn yourself in.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.369
You want to keep arguing with this fool

15:12.495 --> 15:14.246
or figure out
where the hell we're gonna post up?

15:14.330 --> 15:15.539
Hey, I ain't arguing with him.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.291
Now he's funny.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.878
Irony's not lost on me that a high school
is my last stop before prison,

15:22.005 --> 15:24.047
as they are about the same.

15:24.674 --> 15:27.259
That's why I dropped out
and joined the army.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.344
You went from high school to Vietnam?

15:29.470 --> 15:31.471
Out of the frying pan, into the fire?

15:31.556 --> 15:36.018
Except I wasn't humping through the bush,

15:36.144 --> 15:37.311
sidestepping land mines.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.938
I was flying an O-1 Bird Dog,

15:40.023 --> 15:43.066
having a grand, old time on the high wire.

15:43.192 --> 15:46.028
My goodness. You've led the life of 10 men.

15:46.154 --> 15:49.865
It's a wonder you keep
straight what's real and what's horse shit.

15:49.991 --> 15:53.493
You going at me like this
'cause I had you fooled, Raylan?

15:54.370 --> 15:57.873
No. I am getting tired
of the folksy reminiscing, though.

15:57.999 --> 16:03.086
Well, I was right under your nose
riding around for two days.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.839
So, you'll be the big hero
who got Drew Thompson,

16:05.923 --> 16:10.427
but you will be the butt
of a couple of jokes, too.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.597
I got my man. That's no joke.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.059
Because you're such a great marshal?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.769
That's debatable, seeing as how

16:18.895 --> 16:22.564
you got us pared down to three people
against a goddamn Apache raid.

16:22.649 --> 16:27.069
Playing the part of a lawman
don't mean you know shit about shit.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.738
I know desperate moves when I see them.

16:29.822 --> 16:33.575
Is that how you want us to see you,
Drew, the underdog?

16:33.660 --> 16:37.037
If you're implying that
what I did to get free of the Detroit mob...

16:37.121 --> 16:38.163
What you did to Waldo Truth.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.957
...was anything more
than desperation, you're wrong.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.542
What did you do to Waldo?

16:42.627 --> 16:44.086
I mean how?

16:44.170 --> 16:47.172
Knock him over the head,
dump him out the plane?

16:47.924 --> 16:50.342
Hold a gun on him, make the man jump?

16:50.426 --> 16:54.262
Or did you give him
a smile and a thumbs-up as he stepped out,

16:54.347 --> 16:56.932
knowing you'd rigged his chute
and he was going to his death?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.852
I took no pleasure in what I did.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.105
Hate to think of it, even to this day.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.732
Plus, the world's
a much better place without him.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.983
That how you justified it?

17:08.111 --> 17:09.111
Frankly, yes.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.529
That's your thing, it seems.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.781
You do what you got to do
to get what you want.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.576
Question I have is,
listening to all this damn back-and-forth,

17:16.661 --> 17:17.743
what do you want?

17:17.829 --> 17:21.455
I want a shower and a change of clothes.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.834
But that ship has sailed.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.627
Hey, Bob. What can I do for you?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.422
Hey, Raylan. I'm at Arlo's.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.132
A motion detector went off.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.426
Yeah, no, it's all right. We were just there.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.136
Hey, where are you? What's going on?

17:34.220 --> 17:37.723
You wouldn't by chance happen to be
at Evarts High School, would you?

17:37.807 --> 17:38.890
What?

17:38.975 --> 17:41.268
Well, they're having trouble
with wire thieves,

17:41.352 --> 17:43.687
so they asked me to put in
some motion detectors, and I got a text.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.525
Okay. Listen.
Bob, you need to get away from Arlo's.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.154
Hey, is this one of yours?

17:52.238 --> 17:53.822
Is what one of mine?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.366
Truck come tearing ass up the driveway.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.493
Bob, hide.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.961
Look, I understand
you're growing impatient, Mr. Augustine.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.130
But we want the same thing.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.882
I just need a little more time.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.217
Helicopter's landing at the old man's house.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.052
That would be true if
Raylan Givens was there,

18:16.179 --> 18:17.804
but Raylan Givens is not there.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.389
And you know this how?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.725
We dug coal together.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.733
They dug coal together.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.235
Why don't you call Yolo?

18:38.075 --> 18:39.826
Where are you?

18:39.911 --> 18:41.620
He's at the house.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.163
No sign of Givens or Drew.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.539
What?

18:45.708 --> 18:48.794
He's got a guy there
who's in some kind of a uniform.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.170
What are you, a crossing guard?

18:50.254 --> 18:54.424
I'm a town constable,
duly elected by the people of Harlan County.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.635
He says he's a constable.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.595
Yeah, I don't know what that is, either.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.722
Well, I just checked his cell phone,

19:00.807 --> 19:03.725
and it said he called
Raylan Givens five minutes ago.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.145
Wait a second.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.856
All right.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.526
If the helicopter's not landing there,
where is it going to land?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.860
There's a thousand places.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.404
For anybody else, but not for Raylan Givens.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.453
- Are you sure that car's gonna go boom?
- I am.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.457
Hold up, Chief.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.085
That marshal down there
was a sniper in the Rangers.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.463
You take the shot that you now do not have,

19:33.923 --> 19:37.259
and give away our position,
he's gonna put holes in both of us.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.939
Cousin Johnny, Ava?

19:51.858 --> 19:55.819
What is the coolest, most awesomest thing
ever happened to us in high school?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.863
Holy shit, you're right.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.197
The astronaut.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.867
The astronaut. And what was he flying?

20:01.951 --> 20:03.785
- Helicopter.
- A helicopter.

20:04.412 --> 20:08.582
Mr. Augustine,
this astronaut came to see us in high school.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.334
He landed a helicopter
right on the baseball diamond.

20:11.419 --> 20:15.005
A Deputy U.S. Marshal is
gonna gun up and hole out in a school?

20:15.798 --> 20:16.882
It's in the town of Evarts.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.634
It's empty.
It has been so ever since they consolidated.

20:20.303 --> 20:23.388
Now, if you will let me take your man, here...

20:23.472 --> 20:25.265
- What's your name?
- Picker.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.600
Picker.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.019
If you will let me take Picker,

20:29.103 --> 20:33.023
I will bring you
Drew Thompson back, dead or alive.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.570
Go. Take him.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.488
Hey, Yolo.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.325
See if uniform boy knows anything about
them being in a high school, okay?

20:43.409 --> 20:44.534
Good.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.795
They call me "Yolo."
You know what that means?

20:56.672 --> 20:58.465
Yolo.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.009
"You only live once."

21:01.093 --> 21:02.677
- That's true. You only live once.
- Yeah.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.804
And you know when I say it?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.725
When shit is about to get real.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.518
And guess what?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.021
Shit's about to get real.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.654
Come on. Tell me where he is.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.364
Is he in the school, huh?

21:22.448 --> 21:25.116
Oh, man. Look. Look. I don't know.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.701
I don't know who
you're talking about, all right?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.161
Drew. I'm talking about Drew.

21:28.245 --> 21:33.333
All right. What, the... Drew?
The doctor on TV?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.298
Son of a bitch!

21:40.383 --> 21:42.467
Tell me where he is! Tell me where Drew is!

21:42.551 --> 21:45.053
- I won't say! I won't say. I won't say.
- Come on. Come on.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.306
He's...

21:49.892 --> 21:51.434
Come on. Tell me where he is.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.186
Like Nancy Drew?

21:59.902 --> 22:01.736
Okay.

22:03.781 --> 22:05.281
Okay! Okay!

22:06.325 --> 22:08.284
I won't tell you. I won't tell you.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.788
Look. I swear to God.
I'm about to really hurt you, okay?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.289
I'm really about to hurt you...

22:13.374 --> 22:15.959
- I know!
...if you do not tell me where he is.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.752
- Okay. He's...
- Where is Drew?

22:21.549 --> 22:24.134
He's...

22:25.511 --> 22:27.053
Drew-bacca? Drew-bacca.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.895
Where is he?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.530
Drew-la-la?

22:45.614 --> 22:47.157
Come on. Just tell me where he is, huh?

22:47.241 --> 22:49.409
Come on! Tell me where Drew is.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.161
- He's...
- Tell me, Bob!

22:51.245 --> 22:52.829
Tell me where he is! Come on!

22:59.670 --> 23:03.298
Drew... Drew... Drew Mama.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.469
Drew Mama.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.473
You're a funny guy. You know that?

23:11.557 --> 23:14.392
You got some balls on you.
You know what? I really like you.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.977
And because of that,
I'm gonna let you have a break.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.562
- Oh, God.
- Have a break, okay?

23:17.646 --> 23:19.189
- Take a breather.
- Get my breath.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.648
Yeah, catch your breath. There you go.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.276
Okay? You catch your breath.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.739
Shit, you're wearing me out.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.116
You doing okay?

23:30.201 --> 23:31.576
No! No.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.952
Okay. I didn't think so.

23:39.168 --> 23:40.376
Okay.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.716
Do they have Drew at the school?

23:48.177 --> 23:52.555
Drew... Drew... Drew-sitania?

23:53.015 --> 23:56.518
Drew-sitania. Drew-sitania. Drew-sitania.

23:59.814 --> 24:01.314
I don't even know what that means.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.117
Oh, shit. I think I broke him.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.160
Come on, little guy. Get up.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.116
- Bob.
- Ray... Raylan.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.421
It's all right.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.257
Yeah.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.717
Well, did he say anything?

25:11.468 --> 25:13.261
You tell him we're at the school?

25:13.888 --> 25:16.181
No.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.978
Well, I just saw their helo
fly off in your direction.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.730
You need to get the hell out of there.

25:23.814 --> 25:24.981
Got it.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.776
Bob. Listen to me. We got to move.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.362
- You able to walk?
- Yeah.

25:31.447 --> 25:33.907
Why don't you carry me?
How about you carry me?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.209
Okay.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.335
"Drew-bacca," huh?

25:45.419 --> 25:47.086
Yeah, it just came right out.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.675
It's 5:30.

25:53.969 --> 25:57.263
You can tell what time it is in Harlan
without looking at your watch.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.098
That's the 5:30 coal train.

25:59.183 --> 26:00.975
Fifteen minutes until the helo gets here.

26:02.353 --> 26:06.606
Well, then, by 6:00, I'll either be in the air or...

26:07.524 --> 26:11.152
In heaven, if that's
the direction I'm headed, which I doubt.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.528
You'll be in the air.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.032
We're good!

26:19.912 --> 26:21.246
We have a problem.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.414
My God. What happened?

26:23.499 --> 26:25.541
What happened is
Bob's a tough son of a bitch.

26:25.626 --> 26:26.834
Get up.

26:28.379 --> 26:29.462
Here.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.881
It's too soon to be ours.

26:31.966 --> 26:33.424
And that's the problem.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.553
We don't know
how many they have or what they might do.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.639
They could crash a car
through the front doors,

26:39.723 --> 26:40.932
send men through the windows.

26:42.059 --> 26:44.185
We could spread out,
put one of us at each corner,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.271
but there's four corners, only three of us.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.398
You could have four.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.234
I want you to know
I can be the man I became,

26:51.318 --> 26:52.527
not just the man I was.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.695
What are you thinking?

26:53.779 --> 26:57.907
Thinking we get up to the roof,
take cover, pick off any dare approach.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.244
You best with a rifle or a shotgun?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.371
Whatever you care to part with.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.040
See, Rachel?

27:06.125 --> 27:07.709
There it is. That's his angle.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.462
Listen, Shelby, Drew, whoever you are.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.423
There's something you need to understand.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.883
You are a criminal.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.593
You understand? You're on that side.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.054
Rachel, Bob, and I, we're on this side.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.389
Now, I like arguing with you,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.141
but I ain't handing you a goddamn gun.

27:23.225 --> 27:25.310
- What about Art and Tim?
- They're still stopped.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.312
Tim, we need to go back up Raylan.

27:28.564 --> 27:30.023
Are you sure that thing's gonna blow?

27:30.107 --> 27:31.190
I am.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.484
We need to get on it.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.445
That's what I'm doing.

27:36.405 --> 27:37.905
Molotov cocktail, huh?

27:40.743 --> 27:45.705
I haven't seen one of those
since that Guns n' Roses concert in 1989.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.041
Shit. What the hell we gonna do now?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.834
Now I'm gonna go have a word.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.002
A word?

27:51.086 --> 27:52.754
Try to convince them they can't win.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.340
- You got your gun?
- I got... Yeah.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.592
- Take Yoda's.
- Yolo's.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.428
Whatever.
You got 12 in the clip, one in the throat.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.597
I'm a law-enforcement professional.
I'm familiar.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.807
Bob, don't shoot unless you have to.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.560
What constitutes "have to"?

28:07.644 --> 28:10.229
You see you're
gonna die if you don't, pull the trigger.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.858
- Stay frosty.
- Stay frosty.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.404
Is that you, Boyd?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.616
For the record, that makes me two for two.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.784
For the record, it doesn't matter.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.494
Who's your friend?

28:24.578 --> 28:26.120
His name's Picker.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.582
I didn't ask to think if he played guitar.

28:31.251 --> 28:33.336
You Givens?

28:33.420 --> 28:34.587
You know why we're here, right?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.964
Yeah. Boyd,
what was the name of that astronaut?

28:38.425 --> 28:40.134
You know, I don't recall.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.970
He was a big deal. Went up to the moon.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.597
He swung the golf club, Raylan.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.265
He drove the car.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.559
Raylan, I was the one
enamoured with space flight.

28:48.644 --> 28:49.977
I'm pretty sure I'm right on this one.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.854
He drove the car. I'll bet a dollar.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.356
Well, I don't have it on me now, Raylan, but...

28:53.440 --> 28:55.024
- For Christ's sake.
- Right.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.692
- Jesus.
- Raylan, you know I like

28:56.777 --> 28:59.028
a good conversation
as much as anybody, but...

28:59.113 --> 29:01.531
But being as matters are pressing?

29:01.615 --> 29:04.867
Why don't you just hand
over Drew Thompson to these...

29:04.952 --> 29:10.873
Well, I won't say nice, but people,
and save you and me a whole lot of trouble?

29:10.958 --> 29:12.708
Your buddy's right.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.001
I don't give a rat's ass about you.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.711
Just Thompson.

29:15.796 --> 29:19.382
Well, first off, I ain't handing over anyone,

29:19.466 --> 29:22.343
or, generally speaking,
doing anything either of you say.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.262
And secondly, and perhaps more important,

29:24.346 --> 29:27.265
you two come any further,
you're gonna have a bad afternoon.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.391
Now we're having fun.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.643
Raylan, just listen to reason.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.311
It's just the two of you?

29:32.396 --> 29:34.188
Why don't you come back
when you got a few more guys.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.690
Meantime, I'll be upstairs.

29:35.774 --> 29:39.193
You want to continue this conversation,
I won't be too tough to find.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.237
He wants Butch and Sundance, he'll get it.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.448
- He's usually a little more fair-minded.
- Not today.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.825
As long as you're inviting people,
make it a party.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.953
It's okay. It's me, Bob.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.081
- What happened?
- They're calling for backup.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.666
Then?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.126
Then they're coming in.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.879
But you got it handled, right?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.423
I figure I bought us maybe five minutes.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.259
All right, well, then, I ought to say this.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.510
Don't.

30:04.595 --> 30:05.803
Okay.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.476
Four cars, and not one
goddamn cigarette lighter

30:11.560 --> 30:13.811
that isn't being used
to charge a goddamn cell phone,

30:13.896 --> 30:15.271
and none of you smoke.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.522
Nobody smokes?

30:16.607 --> 30:18.441
This is Kentucky, not Sausalito.

30:18.525 --> 30:19.650
What's wrong with you people?

30:22.988 --> 30:24.155
Well, damn!

30:24.239 --> 30:25.406
I thought you were gonna throw it!

30:25.491 --> 30:26.574
God damn!

30:45.886 --> 30:46.969
Well?

30:47.471 --> 30:48.554
I think if there had been explosives,

30:48.639 --> 30:50.223
it would have been bigger than...

31:04.446 --> 31:06.447
Holy shit. Let's go!

31:11.620 --> 31:12.912
Let's go.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.873
Wait.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.335
- Holy shit.
- What?

31:19.461 --> 31:21.462
I was wrong. Drew's there.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.548
Where?

31:23.632 --> 31:26.884
Look between the SUV and the marshal's car.

31:26.969 --> 31:28.719
- I don't see anything.
- He's right there!

31:28.804 --> 31:30.555
- It's not him.
- For Christ's sake!

31:30.639 --> 31:31.847
Give me that.

31:37.271 --> 31:40.147
You're right. That's not him.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.372
Can I get you anything, Mr. Augustine?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.209
I'm gonna have a smoke.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.961
I haven't indulged in I don't know when.

32:03.338 --> 32:08.551
But circumstances being what they are,
I figure what the hell?

32:24.401 --> 32:27.153
All the bad habits I tried to quit,
smoking was the hardest,

32:27.237 --> 32:28.446
as you can see.

32:31.074 --> 32:35.119
Did you know that
for every 10 years you smoke,

32:36.413 --> 32:38.372
your face will age 14 years?

32:38.457 --> 32:40.166
I read that on the Internet.

32:41.752 --> 32:45.963
If nobody minds,
I would like to have a drink with this.

32:46.965 --> 32:50.134
One hand full
makes the other one feel so lonely.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.595
Why are you talking?

32:57.059 --> 32:58.225
You don't like that question?

32:58.977 --> 33:00.895
Let me ask you another.

33:01.688 --> 33:05.191
How many dicks you got to suck to get to
the top of the food chain around here?

33:05.275 --> 33:06.442
It's got to be a ton of dicks.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.736
It's got to be, like, morning, noon, and night.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.196
Like, ever since you were 14.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.615
It's got to be like,
the alarm goes off, "I'm sucking dick."

33:13.700 --> 33:15.660
"Where's another dick I can suck?"

33:15.744 --> 33:17.203
Dick, dick, dick.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.830
Go to bed, suck a dick. Dicks, dicks, dicks.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.249
It's got to be a ton.
I mean, a small-time, blond girl like you,

33:22.334 --> 33:24.377
looking for a better life?

33:25.671 --> 33:28.798
Plenty of girls like you,
but what sets you apart?

33:29.800 --> 33:34.220
Extraordinary vacuuming skills.
It's got to be, right?

33:34.304 --> 33:36.055
Is that why they let you run the whorehouse?

33:37.307 --> 33:40.184
Because you train the girls in your off hours?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.353
Just like, "Okay, girls."

33:42.437 --> 33:45.523
I'm a businesswoman, Mr. Augustine.

33:49.486 --> 33:53.155
In that you attach yourself
to whatever guy gets you what you want?

33:54.408 --> 33:55.574
Please just answer my question.

33:55.659 --> 33:59.578
How many
tweaker dick heads did you have to suck off

33:59.663 --> 34:03.165
before you got to
this wonderful place in your life?

34:03.875 --> 34:06.001
You know what? I feel like a brandy.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.840
Kind of drink I imagine
you folks up north enjoy.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.342
Hell, I might acquire a taste for it.

34:14.803 --> 34:17.888
You know, your Boyd, there,
he's got a real heart of a champion.

34:19.181 --> 34:23.101
He is willing to do whatever it takes to
get what it is that he wants.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.646
But what about you?
What are you willing to do?

34:25.731 --> 34:26.772
What are you willing to take?

34:26.857 --> 34:27.898
All right. Enough.

34:27.983 --> 34:29.483
Or give?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.371
You really love Boyd, don't you?

34:45.375 --> 34:48.127
That ring he got you, where'd he get it from?

34:48.210 --> 34:50.713
One of those claw machines at Denny's?

34:52.215 --> 34:56.092
He must be good at that machine,
'cause it's hard to get something, you know.

34:56.178 --> 34:57.678
It's always lifting up, then it drops.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.724
Come on. Show me your tits.

35:02.893 --> 35:04.602
I want to see them.

35:04.686 --> 35:05.728
I want to see what got you to the top.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.354
All right, enough, God damn it!

35:07.439 --> 35:09.398
Really, Johnny?

35:10.859 --> 35:11.942
We're gonna put on a show?

35:12.027 --> 35:13.694
Just stop talking.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.992
Wait. You're serious?

35:23.622 --> 35:26.373
I thought you were playing a...

35:33.757 --> 35:34.924
Shit.

35:37.219 --> 35:38.844
What's going on?

35:38.929 --> 35:42.556
Ava, don't listen to a word this man says.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.475
Me and my mouth.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.442
Somebody say something!

35:54.736 --> 35:56.237
What'd you do?

36:03.662 --> 36:05.246
This is heart-breaking.

36:06.248 --> 36:07.665
Don't tell her, Johnny.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.000
He went to Duffy!

36:10.627 --> 36:13.546
He made his play, a while ago.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.218
'Cause guys don't have to really suck
dicks to get what they want.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.804
They just need to betray someone.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.643
Is what you're saying is
that you want a blowjob?

36:27.727 --> 36:29.144
I always want a blowjob.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.276
That...

36:37.487 --> 36:40.239
Maybe I hitched myself to the wrong man?

36:40.782 --> 36:41.866
Clearly.

36:43.994 --> 36:46.787
That you're the one
to take me to the promised land.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.122
Time will tell.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.089
Ava.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.507
Ava, don't.

37:02.304 --> 37:03.429
What are you gonna do, Johnny?

37:03.513 --> 37:04.638
Gonna finish what you started?

37:04.723 --> 37:05.848
You gonna shoot me?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.474
Try to understand.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.476
You...

37:09.561 --> 37:11.437
Don't explain. Just shoot!

37:12.272 --> 37:13.898
What? Can't you?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.149
Ava.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.735
I love you.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.237
That's sweet.

37:23.575 --> 37:24.742
Wow. Okay.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.828
I see what you like about her.

37:44.054 --> 37:45.804
Okay, pal. Open it.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.599
Raylan Givens, are you in there?

37:49.893 --> 37:51.685
The principal's office, huh?

37:51.770 --> 37:54.104
I thought the metaphor was apt.

37:54.189 --> 37:56.899
Well, they got a chair in there
with my name on it?

37:56.983 --> 37:59.360
You think they would,
as many times as I walked in that room.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.487
You're welcome to come in and look for it.

38:02.656 --> 38:03.864
Go on.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.283
Well, I think what he means by "come on in"

38:06.368 --> 38:08.786
is he will shoot
whoever walks through that door.

38:08.870 --> 38:11.038
I know. Go on.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.753
Raylan, old friend?

38:20.423 --> 38:23.217
I don't know
if you can tell from in there, but...

38:24.594 --> 38:27.763
We got a whole lot of men on the other
side of this door, like you asked.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.473
Splendid.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.727
I don't think you understand, Raylan.

38:34.604 --> 38:36.480
It's all on the line.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.274
Meaning they want you
to come through first?

38:39.776 --> 38:41.110
You got 10 seconds.

38:41.611 --> 38:43.654
Nine, eight...

38:43.738 --> 38:46.365
- Raylan?
- Seven, six...

38:46.491 --> 38:47.908
- Any last words?
- Raylan!

38:47.993 --> 38:49.868
- Something ain't right. This ain't like him.
- Five...

38:50.662 --> 38:52.955
Four, three...

38:53.123 --> 38:54.623
Wait a second. Thompson's not in there.

38:54.708 --> 38:55.916
- I'm telling you.
- One!

38:56.001 --> 38:57.501
Hold your fire.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.713
He is right. Drew's not here.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.216
Hasn't been here for some time.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.554
You want to come in,
take a look, I don't mind.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.017
You just do it real slow.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.063
Real, real slow.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.449
Who's he?

39:28.533 --> 39:30.034
He's the man who killed Yoo-hoo.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.036
- Yolo.
- Whatever.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.163
Him?

39:34.247 --> 39:36.707
People underestimate Bob at their peril.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.713
Okay. What next?

39:43.339 --> 39:45.883
Well, now, you ask again where Drew went,

39:46.384 --> 39:48.594
and then you threaten
to kill us if we don't tell.

39:49.929 --> 39:53.515
Just keep in mind Bob looks the way he does
'cause he wouldn't talk.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.770
Him setting the bar so high,
I figure I got to hold out myself, so...

39:58.438 --> 39:59.605
I guess you kill us.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.816
Fine by me.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.276
You don't hear that?

40:08.073 --> 40:09.782
I believe those are friends of mine.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.202
So you can try to kill us.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.121
But then they're gonna show up and kill you.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.917
Everybody loses, or...

40:21.086 --> 40:23.170
You could be on your way.

40:24.089 --> 40:27.841
And just promise me that we'll get together
and do this again someday.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.679
Where the hell are you going?

40:32.764 --> 40:36.058
Well, you heard him.
Drew ain't here, and they ain't gonna talk.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.060
And you want to stay
and kill the marshals, that's on you.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.853
But that ain't what I signed up for.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.563
Well, what if we just kill you?

40:41.648 --> 40:45.442
Because, Mr. Picker, your God has much
bigger problems than me.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.363
You promise me, too, Boyd.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.198
You can count on it, Raylan!

40:59.791 --> 41:01.166
We're clear.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.253
They skedaddled fast.

41:04.337 --> 41:06.713
Smart enough to know they'd lost.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.632
Well, I thought I'd had a fun day.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.635
Quick question. Where's Drew?

41:11.719 --> 41:14.388
You want to tell them, Bob? It was your idea.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.057
Well, you...
You think you'd need a car or a helicopter

41:17.142 --> 41:20.352
to get out of Harlan, but there's another way.
