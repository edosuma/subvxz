Or maybe both.

30:14.113 --> 30:17.183
And you fuck our brains out.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.119
Oh... Or maybe
you just fuck her

30:20.152 --> 30:22.188
while I watch
and play with myself.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.256
Maybe she goes
down on me.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.425
While you sit
there and jerk off.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.863
Is that how you thought
this was going to go?

30:31.630 --> 30:32.865
I, uh...

30:32.899 --> 30:35.834
Okay, just
humor me here.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.304
Look at her...

30:40.206 --> 30:42.341
And now look at you.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.977
Look at her.

30:45.945 --> 30:46.946
And now you.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.316
What makes you think,
if I can fuck that,

30:51.017 --> 30:52.584
that I would ever
wanna fuck you?

30:56.322 --> 30:57.323
You're a fucking bitch.

31:02.194 --> 31:03.195
Bye.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.532
(BOTH GIGGLING)

31:17.209 --> 31:18.344
Did you have fun?

31:19.511 --> 31:20.512
I had fun.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.414
-I had a lot of fun.
-(GIGGLING)

31:23.950 --> 31:25.351
Imagine living like that.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.086
Every day.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.956
Like a fucking queen.

31:30.622 --> 31:31.958
I deserve that.

31:33.092 --> 31:34.226
So do you.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.294
I do.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.363
Say it with conviction.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.202
I deserve to live
like a fucking queen.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.236
Yes!

31:44.436 --> 31:45.471
Damn straight.

31:45.504 --> 31:46.905
(BOTH GIGGLING)

31:48.374 --> 31:51.110
Let's start
with this purse,

31:52.111 --> 31:56.282
$19,999.

31:57.749 --> 31:58.951
(SIGHS)

31:58.985 --> 32:01.620
One diamond
necklace,

32:02.388 --> 32:06.592
$29,799.

32:07.493 --> 32:08.527
Food...

32:09.295 --> 32:12.364
$476.85.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.268
Two bottles of
Sine Qua Non,

32:16.302 --> 32:17.736
A Shot in
the Dark Syrah,

32:17.769 --> 32:19.205
$850.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.672
That's...

32:21.507 --> 32:24.543
$51,965.85.

32:27.479 --> 32:28.614
That's just one night.

32:29.348 --> 32:32.051
That's before we find

32:32.084 --> 32:33.652
a house we deserve
to live in,

32:34.286 --> 32:37.323
the cars that we
deserve to drive,

32:37.523 --> 32:42.128
by the way I'm going for 2013
Mercedes Brabus 800 Roadster.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.430
What about you?

32:44.696 --> 32:47.099
I always wanted
a Porsche 911.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.669
Ooh, old-school,
I can respect that. (CHUCKLES)

32:52.038 --> 32:56.008
So that's another
$850,000

32:56.042 --> 33:00.346
plus let's say
the 911 is like $100,000...

33:02.314 --> 33:05.584
I hate to tell you this babe,
but we're broke.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.325
Ethan Kelly has $15,000,000
of my money.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.195
Of your money.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.731
He pays us
what he owes us.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.302
And we live
the life that we deserve.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.439
It's decision time.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.142
You in...

33:32.778 --> 33:34.012
Or are you out?

33:39.118 --> 33:40.186
I say...

33:42.221 --> 33:43.389
Let's go get our money.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.691
(CHUCKLING)
That's my girl.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.300
Someone not get their
vitamin C this morning?

33:54.333 --> 33:55.334
Check this out.

34:00.672 --> 34:01.773
That's not my color.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.475
Noted.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.078
That is why you make
sure to hydrate

34:06.112 --> 34:08.214
before committing a double
murder at a residential home.

34:08.247 --> 34:10.116
You use this technique
to get laid, don't you?

34:10.582 --> 34:11.817
Ah, you know,
whatever it takes.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.052
-(CHUCKLES)
-Hey. See these?

34:14.753 --> 34:17.423
They're 100% worsted wool
from a trusted mill

34:17.456 --> 34:19.191
with a super thread
count of 120.

34:19.225 --> 34:21.560
They're worth, like,
$3,500 each.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.263
You're talking to a T-shirt-
and-jeans kind of girl.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.797
I know, but you make
it look so good.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.833
Okay, so once
I narrowed it down,

34:27.866 --> 34:29.235
I examined the house cut.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.369
Now Brits like
a roomier fit,

34:30.402 --> 34:32.271
with a smoother drape
which this suit has.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.573
How many British tailors
are there in the city?

34:34.606 --> 34:35.607
Hundred and fifty.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.776
Well, normally, I'd balk
at the size of that pool

34:37.809 --> 34:39.278
but I love a British accent.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.446
Right! Who doesn't?

34:40.812 --> 34:43.515
But your guy,
he sewed the silk

34:43.549 --> 34:44.650
from the dresses
of all the girl's

34:44.683 --> 34:45.717
into the inside of
every single one

34:45.751 --> 34:46.785
of his suit jackets.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.221
Yeah, he also sewed it
into the crotch of his pants.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.390
Sick fuck wanted to
feel them on his skin

34:51.423 --> 34:52.424
when he wasn't with them.

34:53.392 --> 34:54.660
What about
the secondary lining?

34:54.693 --> 34:58.430
Ah. This is a signature
color fabric.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.432
There's only one tailor

35:00.466 --> 35:02.168
who uses this
signature color fabric.

35:02.201 --> 35:03.669
He puts it in
every single suit jacket.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.373
Trevor Beasley,
on Clay Street.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.644
There is a vat of my father's
Jambalaya in your future.

35:13.412 --> 35:15.314
-Don't tease me, Annou.
-(GIGGLING)

35:16.882 --> 35:18.550
Hi, Trevor Beasley?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.620
Detective Clea Annou,
Major Crimes.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.855
No, no, no, don't worry,
everything's fine.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.557
I was just wondering
if you could help me

35:25.591 --> 35:27.125
with a case
that I'm working on.

35:27.326 --> 35:28.794
The murder of
Daniel Jameson.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.797
Ah, yeah.
Do you know what?

35:31.830 --> 35:33.199
Do you think that you
could come down here?

35:33.232 --> 35:34.733
I think it'd be better
if we talk in person.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.603
Okay, great. Thank you,
see you then.

35:40.772 --> 35:42.408
PATRICK: Detective Clea Annou?

35:42.941 --> 35:44.176
Depends.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.478
Patrick Finnegan.
Chicago PD.

35:46.712 --> 35:47.913
You spare
me five minutes?

35:47.946 --> 35:49.215
I'm actually just in
the middle of something,

35:49.248 --> 35:50.316
so if you want to talk to...

35:50.349 --> 35:51.683
This is your personnel file.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.187
Where d'you get that?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.290
I found at a bar belonging
to one Ethan Kelly.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.671
You know Kelly?

36:13.239 --> 36:14.240
You first.

36:14.806 --> 36:16.275
Yeah, I know him.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.376
He was...

36:17.643 --> 36:18.544
How do I put this?

36:18.577 --> 36:20.812
Party to the murder of
my partner in Chicago.

36:21.647 --> 36:22.914
Kelly's wanted for murder?

36:23.415 --> 36:24.450
No.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.352
He handed
the suspect over to me.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.486
And she got away.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.488
That was careless.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.590
I think she's
coming after Kelly,

36:31.623 --> 36:32.691
to even the score.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.226
Why not go talk to him?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.927
Because she might
be watching him.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.265
And if she sees me,
I lose the advantage.

36:40.266 --> 36:41.867
He's a CI on
a case I'm working.

36:42.301 --> 36:43.969
(LAUGHS)

36:45.371 --> 36:48.274
Kelly is a CI?

36:48.307 --> 36:50.909
That's... That's...
That's a new one.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.315
Anna Drubeskaya.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.884
She also goes by Mia Rochlan.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.619
I got my number
on the back.

37:00.919 --> 37:03.655
-If you see her...
-Yeah sure, I'll call you.

37:04.690 --> 37:05.691
Thank you.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.430
Word of advice.

37:11.663 --> 37:15.367
Ethan Kelly is all
about self-preservation.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.936
He'll play both
sides until the end,

37:17.969 --> 37:21.440
and then he'll choose the side
that serves him best.

37:22.408 --> 37:23.975
Well, I never
trusted a CI.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.345
I don't intend
to start now.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.417
Did you get the
photos I sent you?

37:31.450 --> 37:32.250
I did.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.521
So he just had you
sitting in Carlucio's?

37:35.554 --> 37:37.323
For an hour,
then he pulled me out. Yeah.

37:37.989 --> 37:40.292
One minute he's ripping
off drug dealers,

37:40.326 --> 37:41.660
the next minute he's...

37:42.494 --> 37:43.929
Doing what exactly?

37:45.331 --> 37:46.765
He said he was
following orders, Regan.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.401
He's a part of something
bigger, I'm telling you.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.504
Where's Clea?

37:53.539 --> 37:54.873
She said she was busy.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.542
Is she brushing us off?

37:57.509 --> 37:58.910
No, maybe she
doesn't trust us.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.313
Maybe she
doesn't trust you.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.450
You know, I got to be honest,
this team-building thing

38:04.483 --> 38:05.551
you got going on here,

38:05.584 --> 38:06.585
it's really effective.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.053
(CHUCKLING)

38:09.054 --> 38:10.989
You know why I became
a lawyer instead of a cop?

38:12.724 --> 38:13.692
Better dental plan?

38:13.725 --> 38:16.495
So I wouldn't have
to do tedious shit like this.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.331
And that attitude is exactly
why I never became a lawyer.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.832
You wanted a different
kind of glory.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.669
You dropped out a semester
shy of graduating...

38:23.702 --> 38:25.036
ETHAN: It didn't matter,
Regan.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.938
When those towers went down,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.574
I was going
no matter where I was.

38:29.541 --> 38:32.644
There's no glory, Regan,
in what I did overseas.

38:33.579 --> 38:34.580
Any regrets?

38:36.448 --> 38:37.783
Not while I was serving, no.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.452
What do you mean?

38:42.421 --> 38:43.955
My regrets came afterwards.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.092
Did you run the plate
on that guy's car yet?

38:48.694 --> 38:50.028
Michael Donahue.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.498
Served in Iraq. Member of
several militias.

38:52.531 --> 38:55.734
Your generally disgruntled,
side-lined American citizen.

38:56.835 --> 38:57.903
Look at these receipts.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.406
Oaks has his pool guy
coming twice a week.

39:00.939 --> 39:01.973
So?

39:02.441 --> 39:03.909
Well, his pool
was filthy, Regan.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.379
Either he's the worst
pool guy in all the Bay Area

39:07.413 --> 39:09.347
or he wasn't going
there to clean it.

39:09.881 --> 39:10.916
It's a reach.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.551
Maybe.

39:14.786 --> 39:17.489
I was saddened to hear of
Mr. Jameson's passing.

39:17.823 --> 39:19.124
It was nice to fit someone

39:19.157 --> 39:20.759
who actually appreciated
the craft.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.395
So you didn't put in
this secondary lining?

39:23.429 --> 39:24.362
No.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.832
I would never use blanket
stitching on lining.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.434
Too cute in my opinion.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.536
How many suits did you
make for Mr. Jameson?

39:30.569 --> 39:32.070
A lot. He was
very particular.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.004
Would he come
in for fittings?

39:33.038 --> 39:36.442
Yes, then his driver
would come pick them up.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.076
James Richardson?

39:38.109 --> 39:40.612
That's the driver his
company provided.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.615
The guy that picked up
his suits was Mexican.

39:45.116 --> 39:46.418
Do you remember his name?

39:46.752 --> 39:47.753
Hmm...

39:48.454 --> 39:50.556
Surname started
with an F, I think.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.623
Flores?

39:51.657 --> 39:52.691
BEASLEY: Yeah, that it.

39:52.958 --> 39:53.992
Miguel Flores.

39:54.460 --> 39:55.594
Are you sure?

39:55.627 --> 39:56.662
Quite sure.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.197
That's the name
Maria kept mentioning

39:59.230 --> 40:01.132
during the interrogation.
Flores.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.969
Do you still have
his number?

40:04.002 --> 40:05.003
Probably.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.143
Here it is.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.616
Okay, I want you
to call him.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.852
Tell him Mr. Jameson paid
cash on his last order,

40:20.886 --> 40:22.087
a couple of thousand,

40:22.120 --> 40:23.889
you want to return the money.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.158
Right.

40:38.169 --> 40:39.204
They're so young.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.474
What did you expect?

40:46.077 --> 40:47.613
You said you were in.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.181
This is what
in looks like.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.628
Detective Annou,
this is Patrick Finnegan.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.596
Um, I was
wondering if, uh...

41:06.665 --> 41:09.200
Just call me if you see
her, okay.

41:09.935 --> 41:10.936
Thank you.

41:16.975 --> 41:19.477
Ah... Fuck you!

41:23.081 --> 41:24.082
Fuck you!

41:26.618 --> 41:27.619
Fuck you!

41:50.275 --> 41:51.509
Bingo.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.551

And all of them with
our signature fabric.

42:51.302 --> 42:52.671
Do you think
he's actually British,

42:52.704 --> 42:53.839
or you think it's all an act?

42:55.140 --> 42:56.574
He's probably
from Jersey.

Fuck. Get the fuck off of me!

43:50.361 --> 43:52.864
It's like they think you're a
miracle worker or something...

43:52.898 --> 43:54.065
They hand you this
picture and say,

43:54.099 --> 43:55.433
I want to look like
Julia Roberts.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.135
(SCOFFS) So do I.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.270
Last I checked I wasn't
a plastic surgeon.

43:59.304 --> 44:00.906
Then they fire you because
you didn't make somebody

44:00.939 --> 44:02.040
look like Julia Roberts?

44:02.073 --> 44:04.743
They fired me
because I accidentally

44:04.776 --> 44:06.144
burned a client
with a curling iron.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.245
Oh!

-No.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.137
Excuse me?

44:35.273 --> 44:36.274
What did you just say?

44:37.208 --> 44:38.443
Was I talkin'
to you, chief?

44:38.476 --> 44:40.111
I think you owe
somebody an apology.

-Patrick, it's fine.
-No, no.

-Yeah.

keep it that way.

So, you were

Yes.

49:16.721 --> 49:17.989
Right?

with his company,

49:20.391 --> 49:21.659
and they've never
heard of you.

49:27.032 --> 49:28.433
Is a James Richardson.

So...

49:32.670 --> 49:33.738
What did he
need you for?

49:38.209 --> 49:39.610
It was the girls,
wasn't it?

49:42.480 --> 49:43.714
You would find
him girls...

49:45.783 --> 49:47.485
And you'd bring
them back to his apartment?

49:50.255 --> 49:51.256
That's what you
did with Maria.

49:51.289 --> 49:53.591
So, I'm just assuming
that you did it with others.

49:58.063 --> 50:01.399
There were 24 dresses
in his apartment.

50:03.634 --> 50:05.002
Twenty-four.

All the exact same.

50:09.774 --> 50:12.210
Were there 24
different girls?

50:39.337 --> 50:41.339
That's for what,
a 10-year-old?

50:42.540 --> 50:43.708
An 8-year-old?

50:46.611 --> 50:49.347
Did you supply him with
children, Miguel?

50:51.182 --> 50:54.452
That's, what, 20 years
in prison. No parole.

50:54.485 --> 50:55.853
I didn't supply any girls.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.288
No? You just drove them?

50:59.657 --> 51:00.858
I want a lawyer.

Yeah, fucking right,
I would too if I were you.

you, you know?

sitting right now,

51:41.632 --> 51:42.833

she kept
asking for you.

your name.

You don't have a thing
for underage girls?

52:23.508 --> 52:24.509
-No!
-Because you were

52:24.542 --> 52:26.411
all alone with them.
It must've crossed your mind.

52:26.444 --> 52:28.446
-You were driving them...
-It wasn't like that.

52:28.679 --> 52:30.481

out for them...

the girls from, Miguel.

still be out there.

and you let her die.

You okay?

56:06.431 --> 56:07.432
No.

56:11.001 --> 56:12.970
Man's inhumanity to man.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.541
Never ceases to amaze me.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.846
The girls were
farmed to hotels,

56:22.547 --> 56:24.582
conferences,
sporting events,

56:24.782 --> 56:26.984
and they were always brought
back to the basement.

56:27.852 --> 56:28.919
A week ago,

56:29.654 --> 56:31.922
the captors cut
their hands open,

56:31.956 --> 56:33.591
and left, they
didn't come back.

56:33.791 --> 56:35.726
The girls were too
terrified to leave.

56:38.763 --> 56:39.997
Why did they
cut their hands?

56:40.030 --> 56:43.801
Because inside there was
a small chip of some kind.

56:45.202 --> 56:46.571
The captors took it.

56:47.638 --> 56:48.706
The girls were told

56:48.739 --> 56:49.874
it was some sort of
a tracking device.

56:50.475 --> 56:51.542
Make sure they didn't run.

56:53.678 --> 56:54.679
Ingenious.

56:55.145 --> 56:56.614
It's one way to describe it.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.421
Some of the girls
recognize Jameson.

57:07.625 --> 57:08.826
He'd make them
wear the dresses

57:08.859 --> 57:09.960
while he fucked them.

57:13.964 --> 57:17.001
One week ago is
when Maria killed him.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.005
That must mean that

57:21.038 --> 57:23.508
whoever's running the
operation got spooked.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.876
Killed her so she wouldn't
talk about what she knows,

57:26.511 --> 57:28.045
and then shut
the whole thing down.

57:33.083 --> 57:34.184
SLEADER:
What about the girl?

57:34.852 --> 57:36.020
There's no cut
in her hand.

57:36.854 --> 57:38.523
She was hiding.
They didn't find her.

57:41.091 --> 57:43.160
Which means the tracking
device wasn't working.

57:44.929 --> 57:46.697
Or it wasn't
a tracking device.

57:50.701 --> 57:51.869
Here's the thing...

57:55.940 --> 57:58.108
She's saying they didn't
put the chip in her hand,

57:59.043 --> 58:00.611
they put it in her head.

58:03.748 --> 58:05.583
And it's still
fucking in there.
