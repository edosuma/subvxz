02:00.163 --> 02:05.251
- Allora, come stai, Leone?
- Bene

02:08.170 --> 02:12.675
Okay, okay. Let's talk business.

02:14.010 --> 02:17.347
This fat bastard is trying to move
in on Morizio's business.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.599
And you know, Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

02:19.682 --> 02:23.985
He just wants
a little conversation.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.856
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

02:26.940 --> 02:28.775
Maybe he'll listen to you.

02:28.858 --> 02:32.862
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

02:34.948 --> 02:36.950
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

02:53.299 --> 02:55.718
Nice to see you again,
Mr Jones.

03:09.816 --> 03:11.818
Remember, neatness counts.

03:11.901 --> 03:14.362
You got one half hour.

03:21.745 --> 03:24.247
One hour.

03:35.175 --> 03:36.676
Yeah, what?

03:36.760 --> 03:41.848
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

03:43.850 --> 03:45.268
What's he look like?

03:47.687 --> 03:49.856
Serious.

03:49.939 --> 03:53.026
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

03:55.278 --> 03:59.199
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

04:03.620 --> 04:06.956
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

04:09.375 --> 04:11.294
We got company.

04:23.723 --> 04:25.141
Come on.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.318
Stop, stop, man!

04:45.912 --> 04:48.832
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

05:35.962 --> 05:39.048
- Hey sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

05:39.132 --> 05:41.217
It's cool. Take a nap.

05:59.486 --> 06:01.905
Oh, my God.

06:01.988 --> 06:04.115
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

06:08.328 --> 06:09.746
Check the terrace!

07:23.319 --> 07:25.989
- 911 emergency.
- I need help.

07:26.072 --> 07:28.408
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Alright, just stay on the line.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.161
I'll just be off a moment.

07:31.244 --> 07:33.663
Sir, I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

07:51.848 --> 07:55.185
Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?

07:55.268 --> 07:57.187
I'll call you back.

08:00.857 --> 08:05.528
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.

08:05.612 --> 08:09.365
Ain't been cut yet. Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.

08:13.787 --> 08:16.206
Dial this number.

08:28.968 --> 08:32.054
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

08:33.222 --> 08:35.140
Bye.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.898
- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?

08:41.981 --> 08:46.569
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. No, I mean, no.

08:46.653 --> 08:48.571
Just for today.

08:48.655 --> 08:51.408
Aha, so it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...

08:51.491 --> 08:54.244
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.

08:54.327 --> 08:56.913
Yeah. Right.

08:56.996 --> 08:59.749
Let me speak
to our mutual friend.

09:01.668 --> 09:03.837
He wants to talk to you.

09:09.175 --> 09:13.263
Make sure he understands,
and let him go.

09:21.688 --> 09:25.608
Do you understand?

09:25.692 --> 09:28.361
- So say it.
- I understand.

09:30.363 --> 09:31.823
Good.

09:57.891 --> 09:59.309
Jesus.

10:08.234 --> 10:11.821
Hola! QuÃ© tal amigo? Two milk as usual, eh?

11:21.808 --> 11:23.476
Why did you hide the cigarette?

11:25.145 --> 11:27.397
This building's full of rats.

11:27.439 --> 11:31.735
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.162
What happened?

11:43.663 --> 11:46.791
I fell off my bike.

11:58.845 --> 12:02.265
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

12:13.359 --> 12:17.197
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know-

12:17.280 --> 12:20.533
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

12:20.617 --> 12:22.952
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

12:23.036 --> 12:25.121
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

12:25.205 --> 12:27.957
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.

12:28.041 --> 12:30.126
- I don't even know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me, alright?

12:30.210 --> 12:32.796
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

12:32.879 --> 12:36.466
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

12:36.549 --> 12:40.136
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

12:40.220 --> 12:43.473
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

12:43.508 --> 12:46.976
- That's all I know.
- You know I'm trying to help you out here...

12:47.060 --> 12:49.729
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

12:49.813 --> 12:52.148
I gotta disturb him.

12:52.232 --> 12:57.487
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

12:57.570 --> 12:59.823
I'm telling you the truth.

12:59.906 --> 13:04.160
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

13:04.244 --> 13:06.079
It's scary.

13:06.162 --> 13:09.249
It's almost like a sixth sense.

13:09.332 --> 13:13.169
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

13:15.505 --> 13:17.841
I'm telling you the truth.

13:25.432 --> 13:26.850
All right.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.187
Stan.

13:34.607 --> 13:38.278
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

14:19.486 --> 14:21.571
Of course he didn't.

14:30.997 --> 14:32.749
Just do me a favor.

14:32.832 --> 14:35.585
Find out who did by tomorrow.

14:35.668 --> 14:37.420
Noon.

14:49.015 --> 14:51.601
Malky, wait.

14:51.684 --> 14:54.687
I didn't cut your shit.

14:54.771 --> 14:57.273
Find out yourself!

15:00.693 --> 15:03.696
What are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

15:03.731 --> 15:06.366
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

15:06.449 --> 15:07.951
clean up the goddamn house!

15:08.034 --> 15:10.120
And stop smoking cigarettes!

16:59.813 --> 17:01.064
One!

17:02.482 --> 17:04.567
Two. Take a deep breath in.

17:04.651 --> 17:06.736
Take a deep breath out.

17:06.819 --> 17:10.824
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.

17:10.906 --> 17:13.660
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

17:13.742 --> 17:16.162
Ready for the legs.
And down.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.926
Sorry, sweetheart.

17:30.009 --> 17:32.094
Squeeze. Release.

17:32.129 --> 17:34.197
Good morning.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.266
Hi, honey.

17:38.017 --> 17:41.771
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

17:41.855 --> 17:45.024
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

17:45.108 --> 17:47.110
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

17:47.193 --> 17:49.195
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

17:49.230 --> 17:51.496
Two and up.

17:51.531 --> 17:54.033
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

17:54.068 --> 17:56.619
move a little ass
and go get some food?

17:56.703 --> 18:01.207
- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.

18:05.962 --> 18:09.716
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

18:09.751 --> 18:13.219
You always come up
with something, right?

18:13.254 --> 18:15.520
I think I went too far this time.

18:15.555 --> 18:19.058
You're going too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

18:19.093 --> 18:21.561
How about working
at home today?

18:23.313 --> 18:27.400
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.

18:27.435 --> 18:30.987
- One-
- Now it's my turn!

18:31.071 --> 18:33.656
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

18:33.740 --> 18:36.159
- Daddy, she's-
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

18:37.660 --> 18:39.496
Please don't shoot!

18:41.414 --> 18:43.833
Fucking bitch.

18:43.917 --> 18:48.713
- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.

18:48.755 --> 18:52.842
When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles-

18:52.926 --> 18:55.929
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

19:02.435 --> 19:04.903
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...

19:04.938 --> 19:09.442
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

19:09.526 --> 19:12.195
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

19:15.115 --> 19:17.200
This is she.

19:17.283 --> 19:20.620
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...

19:20.662 --> 19:22.956
he told us she had problems

19:22.997 --> 19:25.583
As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...

19:25.625 --> 19:27.794
into healthy,
productive young women.

19:27.836 --> 19:30.985
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

19:31.020 --> 19:34.078
Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

19:34.113 --> 19:37.102
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...

19:37.137 --> 19:41.182
but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...

19:41.217 --> 19:45.228
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...

19:45.270 --> 19:48.273
your tuition will be forfeit.

19:48.314 --> 19:50.900
She's dead.

20:10.837 --> 20:14.841
Tell that fucking kid to do
a little work around here!

20:14.924 --> 20:19.179
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fucking mess.

20:19.214 --> 20:20.680
Hurry up!

20:34.110 --> 20:36.237
Why am I feeling

20:36.362 --> 20:38.281
When things could look black

20:38.323 --> 20:42.619
That nothing
could possibly go wrong

20:43.661 --> 20:48.708
This has been
A most unusual day

20:49.876 --> 20:52.879
Love has made me see things

20:52.962 --> 20:58.885
In a different way

21:26.496 --> 21:30.667
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

21:34.129 --> 21:36.089
Always like this.

21:42.846 --> 21:44.180
Keep it.

21:52.272 --> 21:56.192
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

21:56.227 --> 21:59.154
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

23:42.298 --> 23:46.553
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

23:47.887 --> 23:50.223
It reminds me of Beethoven.

23:55.645 --> 23:58.815
Can you hear it?

23:58.898 --> 24:02.736
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

24:02.819 --> 24:04.988
you can hear it growing.

24:05.071 --> 24:07.824
You can hear the insects.

24:13.496 --> 24:16.416
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

24:16.499 --> 24:18.501
I'm gonna play you some.

24:22.505 --> 24:23.923
Daddy!

24:35.435 --> 24:37.353
You better stay here.

25:19.145 --> 25:21.064
We said noon.

25:24.567 --> 25:26.569
I've got one minute past.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.575
You don't like Beethoven.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.044
You don't know
what you're missing.

25:36.079 --> 25:40.583
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

25:40.667 --> 25:43.253
So powerful.

25:43.336 --> 25:47.507
But after his openings,
to be honest...

25:47.590 --> 25:51.678
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

25:53.847 --> 25:55.932
That's why I stopped!

26:00.270 --> 26:02.605
Toss the apartment.

26:23.293 --> 26:27.046
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

26:27.130 --> 26:30.133
I love Mozart!

26:35.305 --> 26:37.724
He was Austrian, you know.

26:37.807 --> 26:41.561
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

26:41.644 --> 26:44.647
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

26:44.731 --> 26:48.318
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

26:48.401 --> 26:51.154
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

26:51.237 --> 26:55.123
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

26:55.158 --> 26:57.744
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

27:12.592 --> 27:15.428
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

27:57.387 --> 27:58.888
Wow.

28:18.658 --> 28:21.327
Oh! Fuck!

28:21.411 --> 28:23.747
He's dead.

28:23.830 --> 28:28.084
Jesus. Look what you did.

28:28.168 --> 28:30.086
Stan, you all right?

28:50.523 --> 28:52.442
What are you doing?

28:52.525 --> 28:56.613
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

28:56.696 --> 28:59.199
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

28:59.282 --> 29:02.619
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

29:02.702 --> 29:04.287
I'm calm.

29:04.370 --> 29:06.539
Stay there, all right?

29:09.876 --> 29:12.378
Benny!

29:15.131 --> 29:20.220
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

29:21.721 --> 29:23.890
Take it easy, all right?

29:23.973 --> 29:25.725
Come on.

29:29.562 --> 29:31.564
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

29:31.599 --> 29:34.067
Benny, we're coming out!

29:34.150 --> 29:36.903
Benny, don't fire!

29:36.986 --> 29:39.823
Get in there!

29:39.906 --> 29:42.325
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

29:42.409 --> 29:45.995
You wear something new and-
Got a light?

29:46.030 --> 29:48.081
Take it easy.

29:49.249 --> 29:51.216
What's happening out there?

29:51.251 --> 29:53.169
It's all right, ma'am.
D. E. A. Police.

29:53.253 --> 29:56.339
Leave that poor family alone.

29:56.423 --> 30:00.093
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

30:00.176 --> 30:02.429
Why don't you
leave them alone?

30:03.847 --> 30:06.933
He said go back inside.

30:11.688 --> 30:14.441
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

30:32.125 --> 30:37.380
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

30:37.464 --> 30:41.217
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

30:41.301 --> 30:43.136
Did you really
have to do that?

30:58.985 --> 31:01.654
Please open the door.

31:57.794 --> 32:01.297
Benny,
there are three kids here.

32:01.381 --> 32:03.716
I think Stan killed this girl.

32:03.800 --> 32:06.386
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

32:06.469 --> 32:08.972
The third one's missing.
Find her.

32:18.148 --> 32:20.900
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

32:20.984 --> 32:24.571
I'm gonna find the fucking super
in this goddamn building.

32:50.096 --> 32:55.435
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!

33:05.528 --> 33:06.946
Shit.

33:08.281 --> 33:12.285
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

33:12.368 --> 33:15.371
- They found it.
- I know.

33:15.455 --> 33:17.457
There it is.

33:18.541 --> 33:20.460
There's cops outside.
We better go.

33:20.543 --> 33:23.963
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

33:26.049 --> 33:27.467
What do I say?

33:39.729 --> 33:41.481
Tell them...

33:41.564 --> 33:45.819
we were doing our job.

33:55.495 --> 33:59.416
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

34:05.088 --> 34:07.590
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

34:07.674 --> 34:10.677
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

34:12.679 --> 34:14.179
Your mother, she-

34:14.264 --> 34:15.931
She's not my mother.

34:16.014 --> 34:21.603
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

34:21.688 --> 34:24.607
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

34:24.690 --> 34:27.025
Not a good half at that.

34:37.370 --> 34:39.371
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

34:39.407 --> 34:42.340
They killed my brother.

34:42.375 --> 34:46.713
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

34:46.748 --> 34:48.679
He never used to cry.

34:48.715 --> 34:52.719
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

34:52.886 --> 34:57.724
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

34:57.807 --> 35:02.228
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

35:02.312 --> 35:04.564
But they smell like shit.

35:06.399 --> 35:07.901
Not true.

35:07.984 --> 35:12.572
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

35:12.655 --> 35:14.491
that's very clean...

35:14.574 --> 35:18.745
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

35:20.830 --> 35:22.213
Yes, I do.

35:22.248 --> 35:25.502
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

35:25.585 --> 35:29.005
Don't move.
I'll get him.

35:30.924 --> 35:32.926
Piggy, where are you?

35:34.511 --> 35:36.429
There you are.

35:43.520 --> 35:46.356
Hi, Mathilda.

35:46.391 --> 35:49.192
Hi, piggy.

35:56.616 --> 35:59.869
How are you today?

35:59.953 --> 36:02.455
I've seen better days.

36:09.671 --> 36:14.467
- What's your name?
- Leon.

36:16.886 --> 36:18.972
Cute name.

36:25.895 --> 36:29.983
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

36:41.202 --> 36:43.538
I'm gonna get some more milk.

37:02.265 --> 37:03.767
Holy shit.

37:09.773 --> 37:13.693
Don't touch that, please.

37:13.777 --> 37:16.154
What do you do for a living?

37:17.280 --> 37:18.740
Cleaner.

37:20.116 --> 37:22.035
You're a hit man?

37:25.705 --> 37:27.123
Cool.

37:39.719 --> 37:43.556
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

37:43.591 --> 37:47.394
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirt bags...

37:47.435 --> 37:50.236
who killed my brother?

37:50.271 --> 37:54.067
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

37:54.150 --> 37:58.238
How about I work for you...

37:58.321 --> 38:01.825
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

38:01.908 --> 38:04.911
What do you think?

38:04.994 --> 38:07.080
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

38:07.115 --> 38:09.332
I'll even wash your clothes.

38:10.625 --> 38:15.004
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

38:22.512 --> 38:27.308
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

38:27.434 --> 38:31.229
You've had a rough day today.

38:34.190 --> 38:36.693
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

38:51.124 --> 38:54.294
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

38:54.377 --> 38:57.380
and it's not always like that.

38:57.415 --> 38:59.299
You know?

39:07.057 --> 39:08.475
Good night.

40:24.801 --> 40:27.137
You sleep well?

40:27.172 --> 40:29.472
Good.

40:29.556 --> 40:31.975
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

40:32.058 --> 40:34.728
Not my problem.

40:49.117 --> 40:50.577
Read it.

40:57.459 --> 40:59.502
You don't know how to read.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.505
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

41:02.589 --> 41:05.592
so I'm a little behind.

41:05.675 --> 41:07.177
What's it say?

41:07.260 --> 41:11.264
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

41:11.347 --> 41:15.852
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

41:15.935 --> 41:20.648
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

41:20.774 --> 41:24.360
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

41:24.444 --> 41:27.447
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

41:29.616 --> 41:33.703
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

41:33.787 --> 41:36.456
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

41:36.539 --> 41:39.417
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

41:39.459 --> 41:42.712
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

41:42.796 --> 41:46.216
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

41:46.299 --> 41:49.052
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

41:49.135 --> 41:51.971
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

41:52.055 --> 41:57.477
But you did open it. So-

42:00.730 --> 42:05.068
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

42:05.151 --> 42:07.404
I don't wanna die tonight.

42:09.989 --> 42:12.409
You're just a little girl.

42:12.534 --> 42:15.412
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

42:15.495 --> 42:16.955
I'm sorry.

42:35.724 --> 42:37.600
How's that?

43:11.551 --> 43:14.637
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

43:14.721 --> 43:16.139
You got that?

43:17.390 --> 43:20.810
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

43:20.894 --> 43:22.812
There is rules.

43:23.938 --> 43:26.649
And stop saying okay
all the time!

43:29.694 --> 43:31.321
Good.

43:46.628 --> 43:48.838
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

43:50.799 --> 43:53.843
Mister, I have to use it...

43:53.927 --> 43:58.014
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

43:58.098 --> 44:00.350
and I have to practice.

44:00.433 --> 44:04.270
Okay, but not after 10:00.

44:04.354 --> 44:06.356
- I promise.
- All right.

44:08.441 --> 44:11.403
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

44:11.444 --> 44:15.532
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

44:15.573 --> 44:17.117
Fill those out, please.

44:21.287 --> 44:26.292
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

44:29.879 --> 44:32.048
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

44:32.132 --> 44:34.384
Fourth floor!

44:34.467 --> 44:36.017
Thanks, mister!

44:36.052 --> 44:39.222
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

44:41.641 --> 44:45.019
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

44:50.650 --> 44:53.737
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

44:53.820 --> 44:55.572
Of course.

45:16.551 --> 45:19.763
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

45:22.307 --> 45:25.852
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

45:42.869 --> 45:45.497
There. Finished.

45:45.955 --> 45:49.042
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

45:49.876 --> 45:52.796
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

45:53.838 --> 45:58.134
No. You just look a little young.

45:58.968 --> 46:00.637
Thanks.

46:07.811 --> 46:11.398
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

46:11.481 --> 46:13.733
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

46:15.485 --> 46:18.321
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

46:18.405 --> 46:22.492
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

46:22.527 --> 46:26.663
What do you think?
Just the theory.

46:26.746 --> 46:28.998
I need this, Leon.

46:30.667 --> 46:32.836
I need time
to get my head together.

46:32.871 --> 46:35.672
Yeah, and I need...

46:41.428 --> 46:42.929
a drink.

46:43.012 --> 46:46.015
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

47:11.124 --> 47:14.544
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

47:14.627 --> 47:16.880
I thought my hearing was going.

47:16.963 --> 47:21.885
I says to myself, Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners

47:21.920 --> 47:23.720
I like to stay in shape.

47:23.803 --> 47:28.224
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

47:28.308 --> 47:31.978
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

47:32.062 --> 47:34.564
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

47:37.984 --> 47:41.071
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

47:51.998 --> 47:53.416
Check it.

47:55.001 --> 47:57.587
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

47:57.670 --> 48:00.757
One thing's got nothing to do
with the other. Remember that.

48:02.175 --> 48:04.094
I will.

48:19.192 --> 48:22.112
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

48:22.195 --> 48:26.032
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

48:26.067 --> 48:28.284
The closer you get
to being a pro...

48:28.368 --> 48:31.621
the closer you can get
to the client.

48:31.704 --> 48:35.125
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

48:40.880 --> 48:42.298
Position.

49:06.489 --> 49:10.326
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

49:10.410 --> 49:13.163
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

49:13.246 --> 49:17.000
And always dress down.

49:17.083 --> 49:20.170
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

49:23.089 --> 49:27.677
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

49:27.761 --> 49:29.846
Who should I hit?

49:29.929 --> 49:31.514
Whoever.

49:38.438 --> 49:40.690
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

49:40.774 --> 49:43.526
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

49:43.610 --> 49:47.113
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

49:56.623 --> 50:00.043
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

50:07.300 --> 50:09.719
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

50:14.307 --> 50:16.726
Keep calm.

50:19.979 --> 50:23.566
Don't take your eyes off him.

50:23.650 --> 50:25.402
Breathe easy.

50:27.153 --> 50:28.822
Watch his movement.

50:31.324 --> 50:33.743
Pretend you're running with him.

50:36.830 --> 50:39.916
Try to feel his next movement.

50:41.501 --> 50:44.838
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

50:53.430 --> 50:54.848
Now.

50:54.931 --> 50:56.766
Oh, my God!

50:56.850 --> 51:00.520
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

51:00.603 --> 51:04.357
One shot. Not bad, huh?

51:04.441 --> 51:06.860
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

51:06.943 --> 51:10.613
Can we try
with real bullets now?

51:10.697 --> 51:12.699
Not today.
Let's pack up.

51:22.041 --> 51:23.460
Like that.

52:05.835 --> 52:09.172
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

52:50.964 --> 52:52.882
It seemed...

52:54.300 --> 52:56.219
to Socrates-

53:04.060 --> 53:05.979
I'll do it.

53:19.993 --> 53:22.412
Leon, all we do is work.

53:22.495 --> 53:25.665
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

53:25.749 --> 53:29.419
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

53:29.502 --> 53:33.339
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

53:46.686 --> 53:48.271
Like a virgin

53:50.190 --> 53:53.443
Touched for the very first time

53:57.864 --> 54:01.034
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

54:11.211 --> 54:16.966
Happy birthday to you

54:17.050 --> 54:21.304
Happy birthday, Mr. President

54:21.388 --> 54:23.807
I don't know.

54:32.649 --> 54:34.484
Moustache.

54:38.488 --> 54:41.991
I'm singing in the rain

54:42.075 --> 54:44.661
Just singing in the rain

54:44.744 --> 54:47.247
- What a beaut-
- Gene Kelly?

54:48.915 --> 54:50.333
Good.

54:50.417 --> 54:53.253
Your turn now.

54:58.758 --> 55:00.510
Okay, pilgrim.

55:03.930 --> 55:05.348
Clint Eastwood?

55:12.272 --> 55:17.360
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

55:17.444 --> 55:21.448
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

55:21.483 --> 55:23.867
Leon, really brilliant.

55:26.286 --> 55:28.204
Amazing.

55:43.136 --> 55:47.390
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

55:47.474 --> 55:51.061
Always happy.
No questions.

55:52.645 --> 55:55.732
It's like me, you see.

55:55.815 --> 55:57.984
No roots.

55:58.068 --> 56:01.821
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

56:05.909 --> 56:08.495
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

56:10.747 --> 56:12.248
You're right.

56:23.676 --> 56:25.095
Wait!

56:39.943 --> 56:44.531
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

56:52.622 --> 56:54.958
It's been a long time, Leon.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.882
I missed you.

57:02.966 --> 57:07.721
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

57:07.804 --> 57:11.808
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

57:11.891 --> 57:14.310
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

57:14.394 --> 57:15.812
Tony...

57:18.732 --> 57:23.403
all the money I make,
that you keep for me-

57:23.486 --> 57:25.488
You need some money?

57:25.523 --> 57:27.073
Just curious.

57:27.157 --> 57:29.075
I've been working
a long time...

57:29.159 --> 57:32.829
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

57:34.998 --> 57:40.754
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

57:40.837 --> 57:43.173
You met a woman.

57:52.766 --> 57:54.851
You gotta be careful
with women.

57:54.934 --> 57:57.937
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

57:58.021 --> 58:02.358
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fucking ears...

58:02.442 --> 58:05.361
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

58:05.445 --> 58:10.366
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

58:12.952 --> 58:15.205
You know, about my money-

58:15.288 --> 58:19.709
Maybe I could give...

58:19.793 --> 58:21.878
a little...

58:23.380 --> 58:25.715
to someone.

58:25.799 --> 58:28.885
You know, to help out.

58:31.388 --> 58:35.475
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

58:35.558 --> 58:39.896
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

58:39.979 --> 58:42.315
No one knocks off old Tony.

58:42.399 --> 58:44.901
Besides, with a bank...

58:44.984 --> 58:48.238
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

58:48.321 --> 58:53.410
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write. It's all in his head.

58:54.744 --> 58:58.081
I know how to read now.

58:58.164 --> 59:01.251
That's good, Leon.

59:04.170 --> 59:05.755
Your money's here.

59:05.839 --> 59:08.556
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

59:08.591 --> 59:12.679
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

59:12.762 --> 59:17.183
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

59:17.267 --> 59:21.187
All right.
Now let's talk business.

59:21.271 --> 59:24.774
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

59:24.858 --> 59:28.945
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

59:52.218 --> 59:54.686
Listen, Mathilda,
you gotta be careful.

59:54.721 --> 59:57.307
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

59:58.558 --> 01:00:01.311
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

01:00:01.394 --> 01:00:04.147
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

01:00:05.899 --> 01:00:08.151
I want you to stop cursing.

01:00:08.234 --> 01:00:10.487
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:13.656
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

01:00:18.411 --> 01:00:21.664
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:31.007
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

01:00:36.096 --> 01:00:39.849
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

01:00:53.279 --> 01:00:57.534
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

01:01:00.036 --> 01:01:03.373
It's the first time for me,
you know.

01:01:03.456 --> 01:01:06.793
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

01:01:06.876 --> 01:01:09.796
'Cause I feel it.

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:11.381
Where?

01:01:14.968 --> 01:01:16.970
In my stomach.

01:01:19.889 --> 01:01:23.309
It's all warm.

01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:28.648
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

01:01:31.568 --> 01:01:36.740
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

01:01:36.823 --> 01:01:39.325
I don't think
it means anything.

01:01:39.409 --> 01:01:43.329
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

01:02:27.707 --> 01:02:29.709
How's the practicing going?

01:02:59.656 --> 01:03:04.744
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

01:03:04.828 --> 01:03:06.746
I understand.

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:08.748
But you're doing all right.

01:03:08.832 --> 01:03:10.834
I haven't received
any complaints.

01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:15.171
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

01:03:16.256 --> 01:03:17.841
That's very smart.

01:03:17.924 --> 01:03:22.512
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

01:03:22.595 --> 01:03:24.764
What does your father do?

01:03:26.182 --> 01:03:30.603
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

01:03:30.687 --> 01:03:33.273
Except he's not really my father.

01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:40.613
He's my lover.

01:03:44.617 --> 01:03:47.954
Think I'll go for a walk.

01:04:02.719 --> 01:04:06.306
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

01:04:06.389 --> 01:04:09.476
- Where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

01:04:09.559 --> 01:04:11.394
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

01:04:11.478 --> 01:04:15.398
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

01:04:15.482 --> 01:04:19.652
You got plans?

01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:26.910
Meet you here?

01:05:41.901 --> 01:05:44.487
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:48.408
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:52.412
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

01:05:52.447 --> 01:05:54.664
Bang, we shot him.

01:05:57.917 --> 01:06:00.670
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

01:06:00.705 --> 01:06:03.423
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

01:06:03.506 --> 01:06:05.425
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

01:06:05.508 --> 01:06:07.594
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:09.679
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:15.351
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

01:06:15.435 --> 01:06:17.854
Cooperation.

01:06:21.274 --> 01:06:25.195
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

01:06:25.278 --> 01:06:29.949
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:43.129
Kids should be at school.

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:46.883
Come on, that's my ball!

01:06:46.966 --> 01:06:51.471
Give that back.
Where you going?

01:06:51.554 --> 01:06:54.974
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!

01:07:01.731 --> 01:07:03.650
Follow the blue car.

01:07:03.733 --> 01:07:06.903
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

01:07:06.986 --> 01:07:08.488
No, drive slowly.

01:07:08.571 --> 01:07:11.408
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

01:07:44.607 --> 01:07:48.111
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.

01:07:50.196 --> 01:07:54.451
Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!

01:07:58.455 --> 01:08:01.624
- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...

01:08:01.708 --> 01:08:04.794
our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.

01:08:04.878 --> 01:08:06.796
I'm Bianca Ferrar.

01:08:11.468 --> 01:08:14.471
It's for you.
A present.

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:20.225
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

01:08:25.231 --> 01:08:28.902
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:30.904
Mr. McGuffin?

01:08:33.323 --> 01:08:35.908
Can I have a word with you?

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:59.409
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

01:09:59.492 --> 01:10:02.495
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.582
in the D. E. A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.

01:10:06.499 --> 01:10:09.002
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

01:10:09.919 --> 01:10:11.838
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

01:10:12.005 --> 01:10:13.840
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

01:10:13.923 --> 01:10:16.509
I never lend out my gear.

01:10:16.593 --> 01:10:18.428
But...

01:10:18.511 --> 01:10:20.513
you still have your gun.
Use it.

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:24.017
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.519
Why are you so mean to me?

01:10:28.104 --> 01:10:30.607
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:34.444
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

01:10:35.028 --> 01:10:37.947
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

01:10:38.615 --> 01:10:41.249
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

01:10:41.284 --> 01:10:44.287
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

01:10:44.371 --> 01:10:46.373
you expect me to forget?

01:10:46.456 --> 01:10:48.625
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:50.460
Blow their fucking heads off.

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:53.546
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

01:10:55.632 --> 01:10:58.551
Your life is changed forever.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:04.140
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

01:11:04.175 --> 01:11:06.893
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

01:11:07.811 --> 01:11:09.896
I want love...

01:11:10.146 --> 01:11:12.148
or death.

01:11:13.066 --> 01:11:14.651
That's it.

01:11:16.403 --> 01:11:18.655
I want death.

01:11:19.155 --> 01:11:22.492
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

01:11:26.246 --> 01:11:28.415
There's this really great game, Leon.

01:11:28.498 --> 01:11:32.001
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

01:11:36.256 --> 01:11:38.717
The kind of game you love.

01:11:51.104 --> 01:11:52.939
If I win...

01:11:53.898 --> 01:11:56.860
you keep me with you...
for life.

01:11:59.028 --> 01:12:00.655
And if you lose?

01:12:00.697 --> 01:12:04.200
Go shopping alone, like before.

01:12:06.202 --> 01:12:08.705
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

01:12:10.373 --> 01:12:13.168
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:14.627
So what?

01:12:14.711 --> 01:12:17.714
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:22.010
Nothing.

01:12:25.889 --> 01:12:28.141
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

01:12:29.392 --> 01:12:32.729
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

01:12:35.815 --> 01:12:37.817
Because if there is...

01:12:37.901 --> 01:12:41.154
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

01:12:43.573 --> 01:12:46.659
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

01:12:56.461 --> 01:12:58.505
I love you, Leon.

01:13:15.605 --> 01:13:16.940
I win.

01:13:34.499 --> 01:13:36.876
I took a hit.

01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:40.046
I need a hand now.

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:44.217
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

01:13:44.342 --> 01:13:46.469
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:49.806
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

01:13:49.889 --> 01:13:51.808
She's 18.

01:13:51.891 --> 01:13:53.768
Really?

01:13:57.564 --> 01:13:59.315
How about something to drink, Tony?

01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:02.902
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

01:14:05.488 --> 01:14:07.365
Nice tattoo.

01:14:12.037 --> 01:14:15.498
Manolo, make that two.

01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:37.854
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

01:14:38.855 --> 01:14:40.857
First you find out
where the chain is.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.319
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.113
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

01:14:48.114 --> 01:14:49.866
Whatever you want.

01:14:51.951 --> 01:14:53.870
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:14:53.953 --> 01:14:55.872
It's Susan.

01:14:55.955 --> 01:14:59.209
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

01:14:59.292 --> 01:15:01.628
I don't know any Susan.

01:15:01.711 --> 01:15:05.715
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

01:15:05.799 --> 01:15:08.468
The light's out.

01:15:08.551 --> 01:15:10.428
It's all dark out here.

01:15:13.723 --> 01:15:18.228
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

01:15:22.899 --> 01:15:25.652
What the fuck are you doing?

01:15:30.824 --> 01:15:32.158
Open up.

01:15:33.993 --> 01:15:37.038
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?

01:16:14.534 --> 01:16:16.786
Here's okay.
Let it go.

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.289
I said, Let it go.

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:21.791
Move. Move over.

01:16:23.293 --> 01:16:24.759
Easy. Easy.

01:16:24.794 --> 01:16:27.797
Easy. Careful.
You want me-

01:16:29.299 --> 01:16:32.135
Go ahead. Your turn.

01:16:39.059 --> 01:16:41.478
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

01:16:41.561 --> 01:16:44.064
Sir?

01:16:47.233 --> 01:16:49.235
Sir, it's not my dope.

01:16:49.319 --> 01:16:51.321
Sir, look I-

01:16:51.404 --> 01:16:53.239
A little left, please.

01:16:56.785 --> 01:16:58.328
Before- Ple-

01:17:00.997 --> 01:17:03.917
Now, the security shot.

01:17:08.755 --> 01:17:11.883
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

01:17:12.008 --> 01:17:14.344
Aim for the heart and lungs.

01:17:14.427 --> 01:17:16.429
There. Right there.
You see?

01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:18.431
The first shot takes him
out of order.

01:17:18.515 --> 01:17:21.434
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

01:17:21.518 --> 01:17:22.936
Never in the face.

01:17:23.019 --> 01:17:26.272
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

01:17:26.356 --> 01:17:30.026
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:32.779
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

01:17:32.862 --> 01:17:36.366
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:38.702
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

01:17:38.785 --> 01:17:41.287
What are you fucking-

01:17:44.374 --> 01:17:46.834
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

01:17:46.869 --> 01:17:49.295
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

01:17:49.421 --> 01:17:52.298
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

01:17:52.382 --> 01:17:55.051
A damp, black cloth is the best.

01:17:58.471 --> 01:18:00.390
What you doing?

01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:03.727
We said no women, no kids.

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:07.480
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

01:18:23.079 --> 01:18:25.373
Now it's clean.

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:29.252
Let's get out of here.

01:18:42.682 --> 01:18:44.642
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

01:18:44.684 --> 01:18:48.813
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:56.279
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

01:18:56.362 --> 01:19:00.200
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:05.789
Yes.

01:19:06.873 --> 01:19:08.625
What you doing?

01:19:08.666 --> 01:19:11.127
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

01:19:11.252 --> 01:19:14.012
Come on. Just a kiss.

01:19:14.047 --> 01:19:17.384
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

01:19:19.386 --> 01:19:22.305
Go sit down.

01:19:29.521 --> 01:19:31.398
Enjoy.

01:19:36.986 --> 01:19:39.913
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

01:19:39.948 --> 01:19:44.994
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

01:19:45.078 --> 01:19:48.873
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

01:19:50.166 --> 01:19:54.170
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

01:19:54.254 --> 01:19:56.840
Nineteen.

01:19:56.923 --> 01:19:58.842
Beat you.

01:21:03.364 --> 01:21:07.744
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

01:21:54.457 --> 01:21:58.294
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:04.968
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:22:05.427 --> 01:22:07.387
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:11.224
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

01:22:11.307 --> 01:22:13.226
Just a second.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.658
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

01:22:28.742 --> 01:22:31.494
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

01:22:35.999 --> 01:22:39.419
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

01:22:39.502 --> 01:22:43.590
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

01:22:43.673 --> 01:22:46.426
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

01:22:46.551 --> 01:22:48.845
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

01:22:50.096 --> 01:22:52.432
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

01:22:52.515 --> 01:22:54.934
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

01:22:55.018 --> 01:22:57.020
Show it to me, motherfucker.

01:23:06.029 --> 01:23:08.990
That's the ring trick.

01:23:22.796 --> 01:23:26.883
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

01:23:38.061 --> 01:23:41.356
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:47.153
Nicer than people, eh?

01:23:47.237 --> 01:23:49.197
I told you that.

01:23:51.408 --> 01:23:53.326
You got a problem?

01:23:56.246 --> 01:23:58.248
Get the chair. Sit down.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.382
I was thinking.

01:24:10.051 --> 01:24:13.680
If something happens
to me someday-

01:24:13.722 --> 01:24:17.600
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

01:24:17.684 --> 01:24:20.603
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

01:24:20.687 --> 01:24:24.858
Tony, I thought about my money.

01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:33.616
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

01:24:38.121 --> 01:24:42.959
Her name is Mathilda.

01:24:43.043 --> 01:24:46.379
If anything happens to me...

01:24:46.463 --> 01:24:50.550
I'd like you...

01:24:52.135 --> 01:24:54.554
to give her...

01:24:56.222 --> 01:24:58.892
my money.

01:25:01.227 --> 01:25:03.813
You can count on me, Leon.

01:25:03.897 --> 01:25:06.316
Thank you, Tony.

01:25:09.736 --> 01:25:11.571
I won't be long.

01:25:13.073 --> 01:25:15.992
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.080
This one is too big.

01:25:20.872 --> 01:25:24.250
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

01:25:26.127 --> 01:25:28.358
Mathilda, since I met you...

01:25:28.393 --> 01:25:30.590
everything's been different.

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.261
So I just need some time alone.

01:25:38.014 --> 01:25:40.016
You need some time
to grow up a little.

01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.811
I finished growing up, Leon.

01:25:42.852 --> 01:25:44.687
I just get older.

01:25:44.771 --> 01:25:48.274
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

01:25:49.943 --> 01:25:52.028
I need time to grow up.

01:26:07.043 --> 01:26:09.129
Shit.

01:27:24.204 --> 01:27:26.581
Come on! Hustle!

01:27:28.666 --> 01:27:30.460
- Good shot.
- Come on.

01:27:33.797 --> 01:27:36.383
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.386
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

01:27:39.469 --> 01:27:42.221
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:44.974
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

01:27:45.141 --> 01:27:47.143
- Only on T. V.
- What'd you say?

01:27:47.310 --> 01:27:50.814
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

01:27:50.897 --> 01:27:52.482
a month.

01:27:54.776 --> 01:27:56.653
Got change?

01:27:58.154 --> 01:28:00.448
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:02.742
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

01:28:02.826 --> 01:28:04.327
Okay, a year.

01:28:05.161 --> 01:28:08.289
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

01:28:11.459 --> 01:28:14.003
So go play somewhere else.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:19.718
I need to think.

01:29:16.608 --> 01:29:19.819
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

01:29:29.829 --> 01:29:31.247
Food.

01:29:34.834 --> 01:29:39.506
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

01:29:39.589 --> 01:29:41.257
Sign here.

01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:42.842
Come here.

01:29:45.512 --> 01:29:49.599
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

01:29:49.682 --> 01:29:51.601
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

01:31:11.264 --> 01:31:13.600
Special delivery?

01:31:13.683 --> 01:31:15.685
Let me guess.

01:31:17.854 --> 01:31:19.272
Chinese?

01:31:22.233 --> 01:31:24.444
Thai, maybe?

01:31:27.113 --> 01:31:29.949
I've got it.

01:31:30.033 --> 01:31:32.202
Italian food.

01:31:48.885 --> 01:31:50.804
What's your name, angel?

01:32:20.834 --> 01:32:24.003
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

01:32:29.509 --> 01:32:30.927
Good.

01:32:33.513 --> 01:32:38.601
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

01:32:38.685 --> 01:32:41.604
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

01:32:41.688 --> 01:32:46.276
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

01:32:48.695 --> 01:32:50.697
So this is something...

01:32:52.532 --> 01:32:55.035
personal, is it?

01:32:58.955 --> 01:33:03.126
What filthy piece of shit...

01:33:03.209 --> 01:33:05.128
did I do now?

01:33:05.211 --> 01:33:08.465
You killed my brother.

01:33:12.385 --> 01:33:14.304
I'm sorry.

01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:25.315
And you wanna join him?

01:33:29.319 --> 01:33:32.989
It's always the same thing.

01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:42.248
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

01:33:42.332 --> 01:33:45.835
that you learn
to appreciate life.

01:33:45.919 --> 01:33:50.340
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

01:33:57.263 --> 01:33:58.598
That's good.

01:34:03.603 --> 01:34:07.524
Because I take no pleasure...

01:34:08.858 --> 01:34:12.243
in taking a life...

01:34:12.278 --> 01:34:17.283
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

01:34:27.711 --> 01:34:30.296
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.633
- I checked upstairs-
- What? I'm busy.

01:34:33.717 --> 01:34:36.553
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

01:34:38.805 --> 01:34:41.975
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

01:34:42.058 --> 01:34:44.943
But they got nothing
to do with it.

01:34:44.978 --> 01:34:50.900
They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.

01:34:50.984 --> 01:34:54.070
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

01:34:54.154 --> 01:34:56.990
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.

01:34:57.157 --> 01:35:00.744
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

01:35:00.827 --> 01:35:03.663
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like-

01:35:03.747 --> 01:35:05.915
No women, no kids.

01:35:13.923 --> 01:35:16.760
I think
it was something personal.

01:35:18.178 --> 01:35:23.433
Death is whimsical today.

01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:54.130
Blood, do you hear me?

01:35:54.214 --> 01:35:58.718
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:01.221
Would you take her
up to my office?

01:36:02.889 --> 01:36:04.474
All right.

01:36:12.816 --> 01:36:14.984
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:36:27.247 --> 01:36:28.748
Leon, my love.

01:36:28.832 --> 01:36:31.251
I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.

01:36:31.334 --> 01:36:36.005
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D. E. A. building, room 4602.

01:36:36.089 --> 01:36:38.056
I'm gonna do them myself.

01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:41.928
If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.

01:36:42.011 --> 01:36:45.932
It's for a contract.
Five grand ahead, right?

01:36:46.015 --> 01:36:49.936
I know I'll feel better
after I do this.

01:36:50.019 --> 01:36:51.938
I love you.

01:36:56.943 --> 01:36:58.862
Wait. I won't be long.

01:36:58.945 --> 01:37:02.198
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

01:37:06.786 --> 01:37:10.123
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

01:37:10.206 --> 01:37:12.792
A nine millie.

01:37:12.876 --> 01:37:14.961
Bullets.

01:37:15.045 --> 01:37:16.463
Another nine millie.

01:37:19.883 --> 01:37:21.968
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

01:37:22.052 --> 01:37:25.055
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

01:37:29.142 --> 01:37:30.977
Holy shit!

01:37:31.061 --> 01:37:32.729
What's this? Lunch.

01:37:35.398 --> 01:37:37.484
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:39.486
There's no anchovies on this.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:00.673
Is that what you call I won't be long?
I been here for ten minutes.

01:38:00.757 --> 01:38:03.426
I did my best.

01:38:51.141 --> 01:38:52.642
Do you like it?

01:38:54.477 --> 01:38:55.729
Yes.

01:38:56.312 --> 01:38:58.314
So say it.

01:39:00.817 --> 01:39:02.318
I like it.

01:39:17.167 --> 01:39:18.501
Not thirsty?

01:39:27.927 --> 01:39:31.014
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

01:39:31.097 --> 01:39:34.184
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

01:39:34.267 --> 01:39:37.353
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

01:39:37.687 --> 01:39:41.107
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

01:39:42.359 --> 01:39:45.528
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

01:39:46.863 --> 01:39:48.948
They just did it to show off.

01:39:49.032 --> 01:39:52.869
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

01:39:56.956 --> 01:39:59.542
Will I like it the first time?

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.632
Mathilda, no.

01:40:07.634 --> 01:40:09.636
Why not?

01:40:10.053 --> 01:40:12.222
I just can't.

01:40:13.223 --> 01:40:15.725
- You love someone else?
- No.

01:40:16.726 --> 01:40:18.478
I mean-

01:40:22.065 --> 01:40:24.734
There was someone a long time ago.

01:40:25.985 --> 01:40:28.321
Before I came to the States.

01:40:28.738 --> 01:40:31.991
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

01:40:32.909 --> 01:40:36.329
She was from
a very respectable family.

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:38.998
Mine was...

01:40:39.916 --> 01:40:41.751
you know...

01:40:43.420 --> 01:40:45.088
not so respectable.

01:40:45.171 --> 01:40:49.092
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

01:40:49.127 --> 01:40:51.428
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

01:40:53.263 --> 01:40:54.597
Right.

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:57.100
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

01:40:59.519 --> 01:41:01.521
He killed her.

01:41:02.188 --> 01:41:04.274
One shot through the head.

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:12.032
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.202
They said it was an accident.

01:41:18.371 --> 01:41:19.873
So...

01:41:21.541 --> 01:41:23.626
one night I...

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:26.046
waited for him.

01:41:27.380 --> 01:41:29.799
Five hundred feet with a lens.

01:41:32.635 --> 01:41:34.471
He also had an accident.

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:39.392
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

01:41:39.476 --> 01:41:43.646
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

01:41:44.064 --> 01:41:46.316
I was 19.

01:41:49.819 --> 01:41:53.656
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

01:41:57.327 --> 01:41:59.662
I've never had another girlfriend.

01:42:02.665 --> 01:42:05.335
You see, Mathilda...

01:42:05.418 --> 01:42:07.504
I wouldn't be a good lover.

01:42:09.839 --> 01:42:11.508
Okay.

01:42:14.594 --> 01:42:16.846
Would you do me one favor?

01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:18.348
What?

01:42:18.431 --> 01:42:20.850
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:23.103
We're gonna share the bed.

01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:26.356
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:29.693
It's okay.

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:32.112
Put your legs up on the bed.

01:42:32.195 --> 01:42:34.280
Yeah. That's nice.

01:42:38.702 --> 01:42:41.037
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

01:43:02.809 --> 01:43:04.811
Good night, Leon.

01:43:07.647 --> 01:43:09.566
Good night.

01:43:32.088 --> 01:43:34.257
I want a piece of cake first!

01:43:39.262 --> 01:43:43.516
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

01:44:02.619 --> 01:44:05.622
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

01:44:05.705 --> 01:44:08.291
When you've killed for us
in the past...

01:44:08.375 --> 01:44:11.878
we've always been satisfied.

01:44:11.961 --> 01:44:17.550
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

01:44:17.634 --> 01:44:19.552
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

01:44:23.807 --> 01:44:27.727
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

01:44:27.811 --> 01:44:30.980
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

01:44:31.015 --> 01:44:34.818
was kind of the Italian type.

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:38.738
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

01:44:38.822 --> 01:44:41.157
Wait. There's more.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:43.493
You're gonna love this.

01:44:45.829 --> 01:44:51.167
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

01:44:51.251 --> 01:44:56.005
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

01:44:56.089 --> 01:44:59.843
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:03.304
The very same...

01:45:03.339 --> 01:45:05.515
Italian hit man.

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:12.522
I'm dying to meet him.

01:45:17.277 --> 01:45:21.614
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

01:45:21.698 --> 01:45:25.869
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:27.954
Yeah, I forgot.

01:45:28.038 --> 01:45:30.874
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

01:45:32.459 --> 01:45:35.378
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

01:45:37.047 --> 01:45:40.050
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:42.017
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

01:45:42.052 --> 01:45:44.554
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

01:45:44.721 --> 01:45:46.139
Right.

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:09.496
Hola seÃ±or! Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

01:46:29.766 --> 01:46:31.768
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

01:46:31.851 --> 01:46:35.772
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

01:46:35.807 --> 01:46:38.358
Is he alone?

01:46:38.441 --> 01:46:40.610
Does he expect you?

01:46:40.694 --> 01:46:43.863
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

01:46:43.947 --> 01:46:47.283
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

01:47:35.331 --> 01:47:36.666
Alpha team.

01:47:36.833 --> 01:47:40.420
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:30.637
What up? Move! Fuck.

01:48:35.975 --> 01:48:37.811
Shit.

01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:41.231
Alpha team. Man down.

01:48:42.482 --> 01:48:44.651
I told you.

01:48:48.488 --> 01:48:51.241
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, everyone?

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:53.827
Everyone!

01:49:47.630 --> 01:49:49.549
Take this.

01:49:55.388 --> 01:49:58.475
Go take a look.

01:50:12.489 --> 01:50:15.909
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:21.664
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:26.336
Nobody moves.

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:29.255
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

01:50:31.674 --> 01:50:35.095
Okay, the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:48.525
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

01:50:51.861 --> 01:50:53.947
You're coming with us.

01:51:06.209 --> 01:51:07.961
Christ, he shot him!

01:51:09.379 --> 01:51:11.798
Bastard!

01:51:20.890 --> 01:51:22.392
Move!

01:51:26.396 --> 01:51:28.565
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.734
Come!

01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:35.572
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

01:51:45.749 --> 01:51:49.335
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

01:51:49.419 --> 01:51:55.008
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:58.928
Stay away from the window.

01:52:45.308 --> 01:52:46.726
Come here.

01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:50.647
Snipers.

01:52:52.732 --> 01:52:56.653
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

01:53:14.337 --> 01:53:18.174
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

01:54:18.735 --> 01:54:22.322
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

01:54:22.405 --> 01:54:26.159
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting-

01:54:26.242 --> 01:54:31.331
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

01:54:32.832 --> 01:54:35.085
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:37.420
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

01:54:37.504 --> 01:54:40.256
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.009
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

01:54:43.093 --> 01:54:44.511
Go.

01:54:44.594 --> 01:54:47.931
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:55.355
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

01:54:55.438 --> 01:54:57.357
You've given me
a taste for life.

01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:00.777
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:02.862
You'll never be alone again.

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:09.452
Please, go now, baby. Go.

01:55:11.538 --> 01:55:14.040
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:20.714
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:28.638
I love you, Mathilda.

01:55:28.722 --> 01:55:30.724
I love you, too, Leon.

01:56:05.759 --> 01:56:11.264
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

01:56:31.534 --> 01:56:33.620
We've got one breathing here!

01:56:35.455 --> 01:56:37.707
Get a medic on the horn!

01:56:41.211 --> 01:56:43.546
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

01:56:46.216 --> 01:56:50.053
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

01:56:53.223 --> 01:56:54.808
Let's go! Move!

01:56:54.891 --> 01:56:56.726
Get that guy off the stairs!

01:56:56.810 --> 01:57:00.313
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

01:57:00.397 --> 01:57:03.483
We've got two men coming
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

01:57:25.255 --> 01:57:29.092
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

01:57:29.127 --> 01:57:31.177
Move your fucking asses.

01:57:31.261 --> 01:57:33.680
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

01:57:33.763 --> 01:57:36.099
Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:37.600
You got it.

01:57:37.684 --> 01:57:41.354
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

01:57:41.438 --> 01:57:42.939
Did you find the girl?

01:57:52.198 --> 01:57:54.784
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

01:57:57.704 --> 01:58:01.791
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here-

01:58:01.875 --> 01:58:05.128
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

01:58:07.630 --> 01:58:10.800
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

01:58:14.054 --> 01:58:17.140
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:36.076
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

01:58:36.159 --> 01:58:39.662
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

01:58:39.697 --> 01:58:43.666
You're all right.
Sit tight.

01:58:49.422 --> 01:58:54.928
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

01:59:19.369 --> 01:59:22.455
Clear the way, men.

01:59:31.548 --> 01:59:33.883
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:24.494
Stansfield?

02:01:27.330 --> 02:01:29.499
At your service.

02:01:38.091 --> 02:01:42.011
This is from...

02:01:48.184 --> 02:01:50.437
Mathilda.

02:02:05.535 --> 02:02:07.370
Shit.

02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.226
Get out of here!

02:02:33.563 --> 02:02:36.483
Leon asked me
to help you out...

02:02:36.566 --> 02:02:40.487
if something happened,
and I think something happened.

02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:44.324
He put aside
a little cash for you.

02:02:44.407 --> 02:02:47.577
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.128
seeing as how
you're still so young...

02:02:50.163 --> 02:02:53.083
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

02:02:53.166 --> 02:02:55.251
Like a bank, you know, except...

02:02:55.335 --> 02:02:59.422
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

02:02:59.506 --> 02:03:02.175
No one knocks off old Tony.

02:03:02.258 --> 02:03:04.928
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

02:03:05.011 --> 02:03:08.932
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

02:03:09.015 --> 02:03:12.852
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

02:03:13.937 --> 02:03:15.355
Here.

02:03:15.438 --> 02:03:20.944
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

02:03:21.027 --> 02:03:25.949
A job?
What the hell can you do?

02:03:26.032 --> 02:03:27.867
I can clean.

02:03:29.202 --> 02:03:31.705
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

02:03:31.788 --> 02:03:33.873
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

02:03:33.957 --> 02:03:36.626
It's over!
The game's over!

02:03:36.710 --> 02:03:39.462
Leon's dead!

02:03:39.546 --> 02:03:41.548
You hear me?

02:03:48.722 --> 02:03:53.476
Come on. You think
I ain't hurting too?

02:03:58.898 --> 02:04:01.317
But he's dead.

02:04:01.401 --> 02:04:05.321
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

02:04:06.573 --> 02:04:09.659
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

02:04:09.743 --> 02:04:11.828
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:16.249
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

02:05:07.467 --> 02:05:10.887
My parents...

02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:13.104
died...

02:05:13.139 --> 02:05:17.811
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

02:05:17.846 --> 02:05:19.813
It was terrible.

02:05:22.315 --> 02:05:26.611
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

02:05:26.646 --> 02:05:30.907
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:34.292
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

02:05:34.327 --> 02:05:39.499
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

02:05:41.334 --> 02:05:44.003
But on one condition:

02:05:44.087 --> 02:05:47.340
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

02:05:47.375 --> 02:05:49.509
I want you to take a chance...

02:05:49.592 --> 02:05:52.512
and trust me.

02:05:52.595 --> 02:05:55.098
Tell me what happened to you.

02:05:58.518 --> 02:06:01.688
My family got shot down
by D. E. A. officers...

02:06:01.723 --> 02:06:05.108
because of a drug problem.

02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:07.826
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

02:06:07.861 --> 02:06:12.699
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

02:06:12.734 --> 02:06:16.619
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

02:06:35.972 --> 02:06:39.642
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

02:07:06.252 --> 02:07:08.922
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.
