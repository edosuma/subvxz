you mother of the world's first Al.

Our friend, Peter... he helped too.

be answered in Lubbock, Texas.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.272

00:25.760 --> 00:27.194
I think you better come with me.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.953
Jason Neville, come with us, son.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.680
We've got to find out
where he is and get him out.

Hey, Tom.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.074
You're never going

- Julia!
- Tom!

Wouldn't do that

So, you're Monroe's kid, huh?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.117
Really? You want
to do a meet and greet now?

How do you do, Mr. President?

06:07.640 --> 06:09.153
Have a seat.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.917
Not the sofa.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.029
That was Reagan's,
and you got dust on your britches.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.759
There.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.837

06:26.320 --> 06:29.073
Here's what I know about you, Tom.

06:30.720 --> 06:35.635
You have spent
most of the last six months

06:35.800 --> 06:37.518

06:38.800 --> 06:41.155
...doing your damnedest to kill me.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.754
Here, you must be thirsty.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.914
Thank you.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.355
Sir...

06:58.320 --> 07:00.152
...I don't know what they
told you about me.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.676
- But let me assure you- -
- They say you're eloquent.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.229
They say honey drips
right out of your mouth.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.511
Well, that might work for
half-wits like Allenford, but not me.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.194
I know the truth.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.151
Your wife didn't leave out
a single detail.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.030
Mind if I finish my breakfast?

07:24.880 --> 07:27.952
It seems like I'm taking every
meal at my desk these days.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.193
Where's Julia?

07:31.840 --> 07:34.992
Alive... for now.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.039
Why don't you just kill us
both and get it over with?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.640
You know Willoughby, Texas?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.996
I have very important plans
for that town.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.870
But just as important,
Sebastian Monroe is there.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.111
He's supposed to be dead, but...

07:52.760 --> 07:54.194
...he's not.

07:55.360 --> 07:59.069
Which puts me in a delicate situation
with the Texas Republic.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.675
The one man in my employ who knows
more about Monroe than anyone...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.115
...is you.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.078
So...

08:10.240 --> 08:12.914
...that makes you valuable to me.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.753
I need you, Tom...

08:16.080 --> 08:18.230
...to hunt down Monroe...

08:19.760 --> 08:21.990
...and execute him.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.560
What makes you so sure
you can trust me?

08:43.159 --> 08:46.835
If you so much as sneeze
in a way I don't like,

08:47.040 --> 08:49.316
I'll have her tongue cut out.

08:49.480 --> 08:51.357
And then her eyes.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.595
And then we'll see
where we go from there.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.117
I'll need to take my boy with me.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.639
If he's still alive.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.950
You think you're
in a position to negotiate?

09:08.040 --> 09:12.318
With all clue respect, sir,
killing Monroe is no picnic.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.312
MY boy's good.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.598
He knows Monroe, and he
doesn't want to see his mother dead

09:17.760 --> 09:18.955
any more than I do.

to normal.

How's your grandfather?

10:02.440 --> 10:04.875

Thank you.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.513
Well, I just...

10:10.680 --> 10:13.035
Thank God I was able
to get that medicine in time.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.992
There were guns on me,
like, three of 'em.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.029
- It was intense.
- Yeah.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.237
Somebody had a gun to you?
That sounds terrifying.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.038
It wasn't the first time.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.799
You're so brave.

10:28.400 --> 10:32.109
Well, your instincts kick in.
You don't even think.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.872
No, I bet you don't.

- We need to buy 'em.
- Mercenaries?

It's good help, homicidal help.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.280
I can go get 'em.

- Excuse me?

- Not even a little.

make sure they come back.

- What?
- I'm going. It's not open for debate.

- Who said it's up to you?

- Heard you saved the town, too.
- Just doing my job.

doesn't mean I will.

to a word you say?

from President Davis, who says so.

Hey, Gould.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.629
Jimmy. I was wondering
when you were gonna come by.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.120
Come on in.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.634
Have a seat.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.795
Okay.
Look...

34:16.719 --> 34:20.031
I, uh...
I want to make things right.

34:21.239 --> 34:24.949
- Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that?
- Well, I owe you a fight.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.117
So I'm gonna give you one.

34:28.639 --> 34:29.914
Tonight.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.797
You put me up against your best guy.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.036
That's kind of short notice, Jim.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.838
It'd be a big draw.

34:38.639 --> 34:41.359
Oh, come on, boss, I am...

34:41.520 --> 34:43.033
I am trying here.

34:44.560 --> 34:45.958
Cut me a break.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.519
Monroe: All right, look,

35:11.680 --> 35:14.354
Gould and most of his men
are gonna be at the fight.

35:14.520 --> 35:18.514
I figure I can get that casino
pretty empty for a few rounds.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.794
But when it starts,
you got to move fast.

35:22.960 --> 35:24.394
Don't worry.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.629
And...

35:27.520 --> 35:30.353
...thanks...
for letting us handle it.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.594
We're partners, right?

35:34.920 --> 35:37.355
And, Charlotte, try not
to get yourself killed.

35:37.520 --> 35:39.397
At least wait until you're
on Miles's watch.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.029
I'll see you two
at the rendezvous point.

35:57.280 --> 35:59.191
What the hell is this, Peter?

35:59.360 --> 36:00.555
Wait here.

36:00.760 --> 36:03.036
You lock us up?
We're friends.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.120
And I love you.
I do.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.669
But I can't have you out
there bearing false witness.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.353
What the hell does that mean?

36:12.560 --> 36:14.756
It means that if these people find
out about your little machines,

36:14.920 --> 36:17.355
it could ruin their faith.

36:17.520 --> 36:19.591
And faith is a very delicate thing.

36:21.080 --> 36:24.072
This isn't God.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.749
I've been thinking about that.

36:26.920 --> 36:28.513
But I don't see the difference.

36:30.120 --> 36:34.159
It lets me perform miracles.
It blesses me because I listen to it.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.596
It's a wonderful gift.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.273
And maybe if you weren't
so afraid of it,

36:38.440 --> 36:41.796
if you just embraced it,
you'd be able to do the same.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.191
Maybe you just like having those
people down there worship you.

36:45.360 --> 36:49.957
Pete, come on, man.
It's me. It's us. This isn't you.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.877
You don't know me, Aaron.

36:55.720 --> 36:57.631
You haven't seen me for 15 years.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.511
Look, this is a good thing.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.114
We're prophets.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.076
We're here because it wants us here.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.391
And we're gonna stay...

37:10.840 --> 37:12.797
...until we figure out why.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.838
