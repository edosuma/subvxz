<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

00:18.118 --> 00:23.789
<i>Life may be swift and fleeting</i>

00:23.790 --> 00:29.295
<i>Hope may die
Yet love's beautiful music</i>

00:29.296 --> 00:35.200
<i>Comes each day like the dawn</i>

00:35.201 --> 00:40.906
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

00:40.907 --> 00:46.512
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

00:46.513 --> 00:52.284
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

00:52.285 --> 00:59.703
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

01:06.032 --> 01:12.438
<i>Like the voice of a heavenly choir</i>

01:12.439 --> 01:19.521
<i>Love's sweet music flows on</i>

03:21.367 --> 03:24.136
Hoo!

03:26.105 --> 03:28.473
Hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.147
Hoo-hoo!

04:49.489 --> 04:52.950
- Wake up! Wake up!
- Oh, what now?

04:52.951 --> 04:56.862
- Wake up, Friend Owl.
- Hey, what's going on around here?

04:56.863 --> 04:59.531
- Wake up!
- It's happened. It's happened.

04:59.532 --> 05:01.500
The new prince is born.

05:01.501 --> 05:05.448
- We're going to see him.
- Come on. You better hurry up.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.730
Oh. Well, look.

05:23.623 --> 05:26.626
- Well.
- Isn't he cute?

05:26.926 --> 05:28.393
Oh...

05:28.394 --> 05:32.967
Well... this is quite an occasion.

05:33.466 --> 05:37.914
Yes, sir, it isn't every
day a prince is born.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.140
You're to be congratulated.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.210
- Yes, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

05:43.211 --> 05:47.213
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

05:47.847 --> 05:52.056
Come on. Wake up.
We have company.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.091
Hello. Hello, there.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.061
- Hello, little prince.
- Hello. Hello, there.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.563
Hello, little prince.

06:04.564 --> 06:07.066
Hoo-hoo!

06:07.767 --> 06:09.401
Hoo-hoo!

06:10.027 --> 06:12.064
Hoo-hoo!

06:22.315 --> 06:26.228
Look! He's trying to get up.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.909
Kinda wobbly, isn't he?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.412
Thumper!

06:54.046 --> 06:56.548
Well, he is.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.226
Aren't you?

07:07.160 --> 07:10.937
Looks to me like he's
getting kind of sleepy.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.134
I think it's time we all left.

07:16.135 --> 07:20.338
Come on. Shoo-shoo! Psst!
Come on. Shoo-shoo!

07:20.339 --> 07:22.441
Psst!

07:25.378 --> 07:27.480
Psst!

07:35.354 --> 07:38.562
Thumper. Come on.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.665
Whatcha gonna call him?

07:43.796 --> 07:48.133
Well... I think I'll
call him Bambi.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.443
Bambi.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.140
Yep, I guess that'll do all right.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.643
Bambi.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.579
My little Bambi.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.556
Walking already. Well,
what do you know.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.531
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mrs Quail.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.536
And where's the young
prince this mo... Oh!

08:57.904 --> 09:01.951
- Good morning, Bambi.
- Good morning, young prince.

09:04.677 --> 09:07.179
Goodbye.

09:09.749 --> 09:12.251
Good morning, young prince.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.826
Good morning, young prince.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.242
Good morning. Hm.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.412
Nice sunny day.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.225
- What's the matter?
- What happened?

09:54.226 --> 09:57.028
Did the young prince fall down?

09:57.029 --> 10:00.942
- Is he hurt?
- No, he's all right.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.970
He doesn't walk very good, does he?

10:04.971 --> 10:07.473
Thumper.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.476
Yes, Mama?

10:10.610 --> 10:14.189
What did your father
tell you this morning?

10:16.616 --> 10:20.422
If you can't say something nice...

10:23.122 --> 10:26.660
don't say nothing at all.

10:27.727 --> 10:31.596
Come on, Bambi, get up. Try again.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.633
Come on, get up. Get up, Bambi.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.136
- Get up.
- Try again.

11:07.933 --> 11:12.037
I'm thumping. That's why
they call me Thumper.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.848
...call me Thumper.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.442
- Thumper!
- Thumper!

11:34.593 --> 11:38.199
Come on. You can do it.

11:38.564 --> 11:42.136
Hop over it. Like this.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.948
- Hop over it.
- Hop over it.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.876
Like this.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.834
You didn't hop far enough.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.498
That's it. Now the other one.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.743
Gee whiz, what happened that time?

12:42.828 --> 12:45.330
Those are birds.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.500
Bur.

12:48.501 --> 12:50.034
Bur!

12:50.035 --> 12:52.776
Look, he's trying to talk.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.706
Bur!

12:54.707 --> 12:57.209
He's trying to say "bird".

12:59.078 --> 13:01.580
Say "bird".

13:02.047 --> 13:04.549
Bur.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.551
Bird.

13:06.552 --> 13:08.827
Bur.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.989
Uh-uh.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.957
Bird.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.460
Come on, say "bird", say "bird".

13:15.461 --> 13:18.530
Say "bird". Say "bird".
Come on, say "bird".

13:18.531 --> 13:21.033
Say "bird".

13:22.668 --> 13:24.202
Bird!

13:26.272 --> 13:29.407
He talked! He talked!
He talked, Mama.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.910
The young prince said "bird".

13:31.911 --> 13:35.324
Bird, bird, bird,
bird, bird, bird...

13:54.266 --> 13:55.667
Bird!

13:55.668 --> 13:57.936
No, that's not a bird.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.271
That's a butterfly.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.440
Butterfly?

14:02.441 --> 14:04.318
Butter...

14:08.347 --> 14:10.215
Butterfly.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.817
No, that's a flower.

14:12.818 --> 14:17.061
- Flower?
- Uh-huh, it's pretty.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.962
Purty.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.871
Flower!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.439
Me?

14:39.979 --> 14:42.652
No, no.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.550
That's not a flower.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.286
- He's a little...
- Oh, that's all right.

14:48.287 --> 14:53.600
He can call me a
flower if he wants to.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.673
I don't mind.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.839
Purty! Purty flower!

15:08.874 --> 15:10.645
Oh...

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
gosh.

15:25.791 --> 15:29.761
I think I better go home now.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.019
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

16:28.020 --> 16:30.722
<i>Beating a tune

16:30.723 --> 16:33.525
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

16:33.526 --> 16:36.294
<i>What can compare
With your beautiful sound?</i>

16:36.295 --> 16:38.963
<i>Beautiful sound
Beautiful sound</i>

16:38.964 --> 16:41.532
<i>Drip, drop
Drip, drop</i>

16:41.533 --> 16:43.902
<i>Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy</i>

16:43.903 --> 16:46.604
<i>Your pretty music
Can brighten the day</i>

16:46.605 --> 16:49.240
<i>Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy</i>

16:49.241 --> 16:51.710
<i>You come along
with a song right away</i>

16:51.711 --> 16:53.712
<i>Come with your beautiful music</i>

16:53.713 --> 16:56.581
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

16:56.582 --> 16:59.117
<i>Beating a tune

16:59.118 --> 17:01.720
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

17:01.721 --> 17:04.222
<i>What can compare
With your beautiful sound?</i>

17:04.223 --> 17:07.092
<i>Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy</i>

17:07.093 --> 17:09.861
<i>You come along
With your pretty little song</i>

17:09.862 --> 17:12.196
<i>Drip, drip, drop
When the sky is cloudy</i>

17:12.198 --> 17:14.699
<i>You come along
With your pretty little song</i>

17:14.700 --> 17:17.135
<i>- Gay little roundelay
- Gay little roundelay</i>

17:17.136 --> 17:19.604
<i>- Song of the rainy day
- Song of the rainy day</i>

17:19.605 --> 17:22.307
<i>How I love to hear your patter
Pretty little pitter-patter.</i>

17:22.308 --> 17:25.042
<i>Helter skelter, when you pelter
Your troubles always seem to scatter</i>

17:25.044 --> 17:27.479
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

17:27.480 --> 17:30.381
<i>Beating a sound as

17:30.382 --> 17:32.717
<i>Drip, drip, drop

17:32.718 --> 17:35.998
<i>- Little April shower

19:08.314 --> 19:11.015
<i>Drip, drip, drop
Little April shower</i>

19:11.016 --> 19:13.784
<i>Beating a tune

<i>What can compare
With your beautiful sound?</i>

19:18.924 --> 19:23.902
<i>Beautiful sound
Beautiful</i>

19:54.259 --> 19:56.961
Mother, what we going to do today?

19:56.962 --> 20:00.068
I'm going to take
you to the meadow.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.367
Meadow? What's the meadow?

20:03.368 --> 20:06.337
It's a very wonderful place.

20:06.338 --> 20:09.273
Then why haven't we
been there before?

20:09.274 --> 20:11.976
You weren't big enough.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.745
- Mother, you know what?
- What?

20:14.746 --> 20:17.648
We're not the only
deer in the forest.

20:17.649 --> 20:21.052
- Where did you hear that?
- Thumper told me.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.421
Well, he's right.

20:23.422 --> 20:26.157
There are many deer in
the forest besides us.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.626
Then why don't I ever see them?

20:28.627 --> 20:31.862
- You will, sometime.
- On the meadow?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.698
Perhaps.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.201
Hush now.

20:36.935 --> 20:39.437
We're almost there.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.982
- The meadow!
- Wait!

20:50.983 --> 20:53.656
Bambi, wait!

20:54.786 --> 20:57.722
You must never rush
out on the meadow.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.225
There might be danger.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.994
Out there, we're unprotected.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.596
The meadow is wide and open,

21:05.597 --> 21:08.466
and there are no trees
or bushes to hide us.

21:08.467 --> 21:11.311
So we have to be very careful.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.310
Wait here.

21:14.773 --> 21:20.552
I'll go out first. And if the
meadow is safe, I'll call you.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.900
Come on, Bambi. It's all right.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.339
Come on.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.758
Good morning, Prince Bambi.

23:13.759 --> 23:16.293
Good morning, young prince.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.096
Hello. What ya eatin'?

23:19.097 --> 23:22.433
- Clover.
- It's awfully good.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.502
It's delicious.

23:24.503 --> 23:27.506
Why don't you try some?

23:29.508 --> 23:33.421
No, no, not that green stuff.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.946
Just eat the blossoms.

23:35.947 --> 23:38.449
That's the good stuff.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.886
Thumper.

23:42.220 --> 23:46.624
- Yes, Mama?
- What did your father tell you?

23:46.625 --> 23:48.225
About what?

23:48.226 --> 23:52.363
About eating the blossoms
and leaving the greens?

23:52.364 --> 23:54.866
Oh, that one.

23:56.567 --> 24:00.304
Eating greens is a special treat.

24:00.305 --> 24:04.947
It makes long ears
and great big feet.

24:05.710 --> 24:10.215
But it sure is awful stuff to eat.

24:10.982 --> 24:14.429
I made that last part up myself.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.957
Watch out.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.404
Watch out.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.900
That's little Faline.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.493
He's kind of bashful,
isn't he, Mama?

25:29.494 --> 25:33.771
Well, maybe he wouldn't
be if you'd say hello.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.981
Hello, Bambi.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.309
I said hello.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.154
Well, aren't you
going to answer her?

25:50.782 --> 25:53.455
You're not afraid, are you?

25:56.321 --> 25:58.926
Well, then, go ahead.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.298
Go on, say hello.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.172
Hello.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.643
You!

29:28.166 --> 29:30.634
He stopped and looked at me.

29:30.635 --> 29:33.445
Yes, I know.

29:33.471 --> 29:37.508
Why was everyone still when
he came on the meadow?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.777
Everyone respects him.

29:39.778 --> 29:46.160
For of all the deer in the forest,
not one has lived half so long.

29:46.651 --> 29:50.963
He's very brave and very wise.

29:51.623 --> 29:57.402
That's why he's known as the
Great Prince of the Forest.

31:03.995 --> 31:06.031
Faline!

31:08.666 --> 31:10.702
Bambi!

31:12.203 --> 31:14.148
Mother!

31:16.241 --> 31:18.482
Bambi!

31:19.077 --> 31:20.715
Bambi!

31:25.750 --> 31:28.059
Mother!

31:29.687 --> 31:32.189
Mother!

31:33.558 --> 31:35.662
Mother!

32:07.825 --> 32:10.327
Come on out, Bambi.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.401
Come on.

32:14.532 --> 32:16.600
It's safe now.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.980
We don't have to hide any longer.

32:21.906 --> 32:26.081
What happened, Mother?
Why did we all run?

32:29.480 --> 32:34.258
Man... was in the forest.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.897
Mother, look! What's
all that white stuff?

34:19.090 --> 34:21.591
Why, it's snow.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.293
- Snow?
- Yes.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.797
Winter has come.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.802
Hiya, Bambi.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.674
Watch what I can do.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.678
Whoo!

35:50.781 --> 35:53.650
Come on! It's all right!

35:53.651 --> 35:55.562
Look!

35:55.887 --> 35:58.389
The water's stiff.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.261
Yippee!

36:13.938 --> 36:17.578
Some fun, huh, Bambi?

36:19.610 --> 36:22.852
Come on, get up. Like this.

36:41.765 --> 36:44.007
No, no.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.296
Kinda wobbly, aren't you?

37:27.011 --> 37:31.084
Got to watch both ends
at the same time.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.960
Guess you better unwind it.

38:04.548 --> 38:06.216
Arghh!

38:33.377 --> 38:36.653
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Flower!

38:39.850 --> 38:43.229
Is it spring yet?

38:43.321 --> 38:46.461
No. Winter's just started.

38:46.757 --> 38:49.459
What ya doin'? Hibernatin'?

38:51.600 --> 38:53.809
Uh-huh.

38:55.232 --> 38:57.567
What do you want to do that for?

38:58.868 --> 39:03.909
All us flowers sleep in the winter.

39:06.711 --> 39:11.284
Well... good night.

40:19.917 --> 40:23.386
Winter sure is long, isn't it?

40:23.387 --> 40:25.889
It seems long.

40:26.157 --> 40:29.228
But it won't last forever.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.398
I'm awful hungry, Mother.

40:35.399 --> 40:38.209
Yes, I know.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.177
Bambi.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.680
Bambi, come here.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.549
Look.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.587
New spring grass.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.410
Bambi. Quick!

41:20.411 --> 41:23.221
The thicket!

41:26.984 --> 41:29.853
Faster! Faster, Bambi!

41:29.854 --> 41:33.456
Don't look back! Keep running!

41:33.457 --> 41:36.062
Keep running!

41:47.671 --> 41:49.739
We made it!

41:49.740 --> 41:51.808
We made it, Mother!

41:52.309 --> 41:54.011
We...

41:54.745 --> 41:57.247
Mother!

42:00.284 --> 42:02.593
Mother!

42:08.359 --> 42:11.567
Mother, where are you?!

42:15.900 --> 42:18.402
Mother!

42:22.439 --> 42:24.941
Mother!

42:26.176 --> 42:28.678
Mother!

42:33.817 --> 42:36.319
Mother!

42:44.194 --> 42:46.233
Mother!

42:51.468 --> 42:54.949
Your mother can't be
with you anymore.

43:10.821 --> 43:13.392
Come.

43:13.691 --> 43:16.193
My son.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.986
<i>Let's sing a gay
little spring song</i>

43:41.285 --> 43:44.153
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

43:44.154 --> 43:47.957
<i>So I'd like to suggest
That we all do our best</i>

43:47.958 --> 43:51.127
<i>And warble a song about spring</i>

43:51.128 --> 43:53.429
<i>Spring, spring, spring</i>

43:53.430 --> 43:56.536
<i>Let's get together and sing</i>

44:00.338 --> 44:03.712
<i>Let's sing a gay
little spring song</i>

44:03.941 --> 44:07.010
<i>Just like the bird on the wing</i>

44:07.211 --> 44:10.713
<i>Things always seem right
When you're cheerful and bright</i>

44:10.714 --> 44:13.583
<i>So let's get together and sing</i>

44:13.584 --> 44:16.252
<i>Sing, sing, sing</i>

44:16.253 --> 44:19.322
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

44:19.323 --> 44:23.026
<i>Let's twitter and tweet
Like the birdies in May</i>

44:23.027 --> 44:26.529
<i>Get into the mood
And be merry today</i>

44:26.530 --> 44:30.033
<i>Forget all your troubles
And warble away...</i>

44:30.034 --> 44:32.101
Wait!

44:32.102 --> 44:34.604
Oh, what now?

44:36.440 --> 44:39.147
Hey! Hey!

44:39.443 --> 44:41.244
Stop that racket!

44:41.245 --> 44:44.347
Scat! Shoo! Shoo!

44:44.348 --> 44:47.754
<i>Let's sing a song about spring</i>

44:48.052 --> 44:50.554
I'll fix 'em.

44:57.161 --> 45:02.201
There. I guess...
that'll teach 'em.

45:06.303 --> 45:09.409
Oh, what's the use?

45:11.676 --> 45:15.116
<i>This is the season to sing</i>

45:18.048 --> 45:21.627
Same thing every spring.

45:22.853 --> 45:25.221
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

45:25.222 --> 45:27.963
Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!

45:28.492 --> 45:30.994
Love's sweet song.

45:31.595 --> 45:35.372
Hm! Pain in the pin
feathers, I call it.

45:55.652 --> 45:58.154
Stop it!

46:00.224 --> 46:03.204
Get out of here. All of you.

46:05.662 --> 46:08.097
And you, too!

46:08.098 --> 46:12.401
Hello, Friend Owl.
Don't you remember me?

46:12.402 --> 46:14.737
Why, it... it's the young prince.

46:14.738 --> 46:16.649
Bambi!

46:17.874 --> 46:20.576
My, my, how you've changed.

46:20.577 --> 46:23.746
Turn round there.
Let me look at you.

46:23.747 --> 46:27.784
I see you've traded in your
spots for a pair of antlers.

46:30.721 --> 46:36.058
You know, just the other day I
was talking to myself about you.

46:36.059 --> 46:39.028
And we were wondering
what had become of you.

46:39.029 --> 46:41.531
Hello, Bambi!

46:42.299 --> 46:44.870
Remember me?

46:45.369 --> 46:47.303
Thumper!

46:47.304 --> 46:49.410
Right-o!

46:53.377 --> 46:55.444
Hi, fellas.

46:55.445 --> 46:57.549
Flower.

46:57.948 --> 47:00.016
Yeah.

47:10.194 --> 47:13.162
Well, what's the matter with them?

47:13.163 --> 47:15.531
Why are they acting that way?

47:16.032 --> 47:18.576
Why, don't you know?

47:18.836 --> 47:21.009
They're twitterpated.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.841
- Twitterpated?
- Yes.

47:24.842 --> 47:29.149
Nearly everybody gets
twitterpated in the spring time.

47:33.150 --> 47:34.984
For example...

47:35.485 --> 47:39.322
you're walking along,
minding your own business,

47:39.323 --> 47:43.459
you're looking neither to
the left nor to the right,

47:43.460 --> 47:45.561
when all of a sudden...

47:45.562 --> 47:49.532
you run smack into a pretty face.

47:54.771 --> 47:58.341
You begin to get weak in the knees.

47:58.342 --> 48:00.981
Your head's in a whirl.

48:01.745 --> 48:04.914
And then you feel
light as a feather.

48:04.915 --> 48:07.150
And before you know it,

48:07.151 --> 48:10.693
you're walking on air.

48:14.157 --> 48:18.828
And then you know what?
You're knocked for a loop.

48:18.829 --> 48:22.242
And you completely lose your head.

48:24.201 --> 48:26.035
Gosh, that's awful.

48:26.036 --> 48:28.304
- Gee whiz.
- Terrible.

48:28.305 --> 48:30.306
And that ain't all.

48:30.307 --> 48:33.720
It can happen to anybody.

48:34.011 --> 48:37.180
So you'd better be careful.

48:37.181 --> 48:41.490
It could happen to
you, and you, and...

48:43.053 --> 48:46.500
Yes, it could even happen to you.

48:48.525 --> 48:51.060
Well, it's not going
to happen to me.

48:51.061 --> 48:54.971
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

50:41.304 --> 50:44.785
Ha! Twitterpated!

50:50.380 --> 50:52.882
Oh...

50:56.753 --> 50:59.130
Ahem.

51:17.774 --> 51:20.481
Oh.

52:34.217 --> 52:36.719
Hello, Bambi.

52:38.088 --> 52:40.590
Don't you remember me?

52:44.928 --> 52:47.430
I'm Faline.

53:53.363 --> 53:55.865
Bambi.

54:02.906 --> 54:05.682
Bambi.

54:07.577 --> 54:10.023
Bambi!

55:46.276 --> 55:49.620
<i>I bring you a song</i>

55:49.713 --> 55:54.083
<i>And I sing as I go</i>

55:54.084 --> 55:57.319
<i>For I want you to know</i>

55:57.320 --> 56:02.360
<i>That I'm looking for romance</i>

56:02.859 --> 56:06.695
<i>I bring you a song</i>

56:06.696 --> 56:10.299
<i>In the hope that you'll see</i>

56:10.300 --> 56:13.435
<i>When you're looking at me</i>

56:13.436 --> 56:17.281
<i>That I'm looking for love</i>

56:18.908 --> 56:21.877
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

56:21.878 --> 56:24.913
<i>Only found when you're
young and it's May</i>

56:24.914 --> 56:27.983
<i>Only found on that wonderful day</i>

56:27.984 --> 56:31.588
<i>When all longing is through</i>

56:32.389 --> 56:35.524
<i>I'm seeking that glow</i>

56:35.525 --> 56:38.761
<i>Only found when
a thrill is complete</i>

56:38.762 --> 56:42.097
<i>Only found when two
hearts gently beat</i>

56:42.098 --> 56:48.937
<i>To the strains of a waltz
That's both tender and new</i>

56:48.938 --> 56:52.441
<i>I bring you a song</i>

56:52.442 --> 56:56.412
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

56:56.413 --> 56:59.281
<i>You're by my side
There's a moon up above</i>

56:59.282 --> 57:02.351
<i>It shines with a light
That's so mellow and bright</i>

57:02.352 --> 57:08.632
<i>It's easy to see
That tonight we shall fall in love</i>

57:17.801 --> 57:22.237
<i>I bring you a song</i>

57:22.238 --> 57:26.174
<i>For I'm seeking romance</i>

57:26.176 --> 57:29.520
<i>And you</i>

58:43.520 --> 58:46.388
It is Man.

58:46.389 --> 58:48.457
He is here again.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.466
There are many this time.

58:55.498 --> 58:57.866
We must go deep into the forest.

58:57.867 --> 59:00.369
Hurry! Follow me!

59:02.305 --> 59:04.807
Faline!

59:17.854 --> 59:19.833
Bambi.

59:20.156 --> 59:22.727
Bambi, where are you?

59:23.426 --> 59:25.496
Bambi!

59:31.668 --> 59:34.170
Bambi!

59:37.473 --> 59:39.975
Faline!

59:40.810 --> 59:43.312
Faline!

59:43.580 --> 59:45.247
Faline!

01:00:20.183 --> 01:00:21.850
Listen.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.919
- He's coming!
- Hush!

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.331
Be quiet.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:31.465
- He's coming closer.
- Be calm. Don't get excited.

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:35.163
- We better fly.
- No. No, don't fly.

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:37.366
Whatever you do, don't fly.

01:00:37.367 --> 01:00:41.405
He's almost here! I can't
stand it any longer!

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:59.563
Bambi! Bambi!

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.271
Faline!

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:03.085
Bambi!

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:05.463
Bambi!

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:34.156
Quick, Faline! Jump!

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:09.578
Get up, Bambi.

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.751
Get up!

01:04:19.555 --> 01:04:22.057
You must get up.

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.496
Get up!

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.299
Get up!

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:37.082
Now... come with me.

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:47.236
Bambi.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.007
Hoo!

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.911
Wake up! Wake up, Friend Owl.

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:32.247
Wake up, Friend Owl.

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:35.922
Oh, what now?

01:07:36.919 --> 01:07:39.721
Hey, what's going on around here?

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.456
- It's happened.
- Happened?

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:43.525
Yes. In the thicket.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.560
Hurry up, Bambi.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:49.440
Yes, Papa. I'm coming.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:21.863
Oh. Well.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.448
Look.

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.273
- Two of them.
- Oh!

01:08:38.913 --> 01:08:44.986
Well, I don't believe I've ever seen
a more likely looking pair of fawns.

01:08:44.987 --> 01:08:48.593
Prince Bambi ought
to be mighty proud.

01:08:52.028 --> 01:09:00.510
<i>Love is a song that never ends</i>

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:08.782
<i>One simple theme repeating</i>

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:13.081
<i>Like the voice</i>

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:19.287
<i>Of a heavenly choir</i>

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:23.291
<i>Love's sweet music</i>

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:27.962
<i>Flows on</i>
