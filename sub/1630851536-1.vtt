WEBVTT

02:14.009 --> 02:15.427
How we doing tonight, sir?

02:15.677 --> 02:19.097
Oh, just fine, officer.
Is there something wrong?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.807
Don't think so, just routine.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.768
Everything heading north
we randomly select.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.603
I'd like to see your licence and logs.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.107
Uh, yeah. My log's down
in the glove, you mind?

02:29.191 --> 02:30.317
You go right ahead.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.324
Alright, sit tight. I'll be right back.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.492
Alright.

02:54.633 --> 02:55.633
How is he?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.135
Calm. Anything?

02:57.261 --> 02:58.470
It's quiet.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.472
Let's see.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.851
Last stop was sulphur.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.604
Norman, the va and the okc next.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.691
Everything should be in there.

03:10.816 --> 03:14.027
Alright, flash if you need anything.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.613
- Hey, bird.
- I'm ready.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.906
Listen, I'm sorry to inconvenience you

03:40.971 --> 03:43.182
but I need you to hop out
and open up the back for me.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.100
Goddammit,
I'm already running late, officer.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.518
I know. It's just protocol.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.246
So now if you could
just hop out the cab

03:48.270 --> 03:50.070
I'm gonna leave my partner
up here with yours.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.193
Hk 9837...

04:38.237 --> 04:39.863
<i>9746.</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:54.837
<i>9789.</i>

04:57.548 --> 04:58.590
And then adios.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.013
Alright, look. I've found everything
except for this one down here.

05:05.597 --> 05:06.640
Hk 9789...

05:16.567 --> 05:18.110
We got at least 15 minutes.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.616
What the fuck are you looking at?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.836
Be cool. Be cool, be cool.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.732
It's showtime.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.627
Fuck's happening?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.595
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:10.180
Hey, sweet boy.

07:10.973 --> 07:14.017
Hey, ma. How you feelin'?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.811
Little better today.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.105
How'd it go?

07:21.316 --> 07:23.861
Yeah, that's what I heard.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.572
You clean it up?

07:32.327 --> 07:34.329
Wyatt, look at me.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.541
Both sides.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.170
We don't ever wanna hurt anyone.

07:42.254 --> 07:45.591
But if you raise a hand,
or you can't fall in line...

07:47.009 --> 07:48.427
What the fuck?

07:50.679 --> 07:51.722
Yeah.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.059
How's your sister?

07:57.144 --> 07:59.563
She's good, going for dinner tonight.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.481
Oh, that's nice.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.818
And Darla?

08:10.657 --> 08:11.825
She's a lady now, mum.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.995
I can't believe that.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.501
I should bring her with me
one of these times.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.669
Yeah... jeanie'd have your ass.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.171
You should meet her.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.677
How are the new meds treating you?

08:30.761 --> 08:33.263
Ah, still with the fuckin' headaches.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.811
At least I can get to sleep now.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.317
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.653
Brought rolls.

09:29.820 --> 09:32.865
Great. Uh, Darla! Get in here.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.409
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, sure.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.662
There you go.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.622
Hey.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.751
Hey there, sweetheart.
How you doin'?

09:44.877 --> 09:46.354
I'm really bored.
Can you give me a ride?

09:46.378 --> 09:49.506
Alright, shut up, both of you.
Take that out to your dad, please.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.676
- Listen to your ma.
- Bye.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.139
How's she doing?

09:58.307 --> 10:01.685
Uh, she's in trouble.
All the time.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.272
Bodie and I
are at our wit's end.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.481
Well, she's a teenager.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.733
Mm.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.986
Yeah, well, you and I both know
that's not what it is.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.906
Threw up so much
in the back of the cruiser

10:13.989 --> 10:15.115
I just let him go.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.450
Jesus.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.410
What are you thinking about?

10:19.745 --> 10:20.745
What dad would say.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.455
Huh.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.417
Listen, I went and saw ma today.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.005
They switched up her meds,
but she's sick, jeanie.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.008
Mean a lot
if you would head down there...

10:33.091 --> 10:36.178
Um, why don't you go out
and say hi to the birthday boy?

10:40.057 --> 10:41.099
Alright.

10:42.976 --> 10:43.977
Play nice.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.979
I always play nice.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.320
Peace offering.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.076
That was the last time
that dog bit me, I tell you that.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.953
Hey, happy birthday, bodie.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.625
Thank you, Wyatt.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.877
What we having for dinner?

11:09.586 --> 11:10.587
The usual.

11:10.838 --> 11:11.880
It's a barbecue.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.422
Hm.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.218
Have you met, uh, Lawrence yet?

11:16.927 --> 11:18.554
Not yet. Nice to meet ya.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.351
What can I get ya, Wyatt?

11:26.395 --> 11:27.563
So how's school?

11:28.981 --> 11:30.232
School.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.192
You causing trouble?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.610
I wanna come work with you.

11:33.694 --> 11:34.862
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.990
- How old are you now, anyway?
- 16 in a few months.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.034
Right. I can't have some
almost-16-year-old causing trouble

11:41.118 --> 11:42.411
- in my shop.
- Shut up!

11:43.954 --> 11:44.954
Tell you what.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.100
This summer, I'll give you a job.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.124
Yeah?

11:48.166 --> 11:49.602
Yeah, you'll get it out of your system.

11:49.626 --> 11:50.794
I'm serious

11:50.878 --> 11:52.087
you don't wanna sell cars.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.381
Get your shit together
and listen to your ma

11:54.464 --> 11:55.883
and go to fuckin' college.

11:56.592 --> 11:57.592
Hey.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.261
Dad, he said he's gonna
give me a job.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.220
Is that right?

12:00.304 --> 12:01.698
Don't worry, don't worry,
she'll hate it.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.764
I'll make sure of it.

12:04.308 --> 12:05.308
Hm?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.685
I got a job for you.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.770
Why don't you come in
and help me clean up?

12:10.397 --> 12:11.440
Come on.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.401
Bye.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.285
Fuck this.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.813
<i>Hey, Wyatt.</i>

12:51.939 --> 12:53.607
<i>Your brother in-law
is here with someone.</i>

12:54.066 --> 12:55.192
Alright, man. Send him in.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.577
Little busy out there.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.496
Yeah.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.040
Father's day coming, I guess.

13:11.834 --> 13:12.835
Catch you at a bad time?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.462
Paperwork. What's up?

13:16.171 --> 13:19.174
Oh, I'm just checking in,
making sure everything is alright.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.929
What can I do for you?

13:25.764 --> 13:29.017
Pharmacy truck got hit
the other night on its way to okc.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.605
Whoever it was knew
exactly what they were looking for.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.609
You a news reporter now, bodie?

13:37.693 --> 13:39.152
Hm?

13:39.903 --> 13:41.280
There's one dead, Wyatt.

13:42.197 --> 13:43.615
The driver is still alive.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.784
He's in the icu right now.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.414
Hey, you find everything
you need over there, bub?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.624
You guys met, right?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.918
Yeah. Yeah, at the barbecue.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.128
It's Larry, right?

13:56.837 --> 13:59.256
Special agent
Lawrence twilley, FBI.

14:00.757 --> 14:04.136
What brings you down here
to god's country, special agent?

14:05.053 --> 14:08.473
Those two drivers,
they're federal employees

14:09.308 --> 14:13.061
and those pills?
Well, that's government property now.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.314
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.654
Look...

14:24.239 --> 14:26.408
Do you got an alibi
for Tuesday night, Wyatt?

14:27.034 --> 14:28.076
Excuse me, bodie?

14:28.911 --> 14:29.911
What about dally?

14:31.747 --> 14:33.540
Look, I know you got a job to do.

14:33.749 --> 14:34.750
Bodie...

14:35.584 --> 14:38.837
Why don't you take Columbo here
and get the fuck out of my office?

14:40.631 --> 14:42.007
I don't have time for this shit.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.598
I hope I'm wrong.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.647
Special agent.

15:27.886 --> 15:28.971
Hey.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.810
You know, your daddy used to
always say to me

15:35.018 --> 15:36.436
you can't fuck with a man

15:36.979 --> 15:39.231
who takes it up the ass
with a smile on his face.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.818
Always found that to be true.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.154
We got a problem.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.949
Bodie came by the dealership.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.326
Bodie? What'd that cub scout want?

15:52.452 --> 15:53.996
Where we was at, usual shit.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.498
- But he had a fed with him.
- A fed?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.083
- Mm.
- Bodie?

15:59.877 --> 16:01.044
What was his deal?

16:02.588 --> 16:04.673
Seemed like the gumpy type,
and bodie's bodie.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.134
They were fishing.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.098
Fuckin' fed, man.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.934
- That's too bad about those guards.
- That's the thing.

16:17.603 --> 16:18.687
One of 'em's hanging on.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.397
- What?
- Yeah.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.442
- Where is he?
- Saint Mary's. Icu.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.986
Oh, fuck,
I can't believe that shit, man.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.615
You go see your ma?

16:29.823 --> 16:31.783
- Yeah.
- What's her take on it?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.412
She wants us to clean it up.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.002
I'll do it.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.048
Good.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.675
Hey, man, we're doing the best
we can out here, alright?

16:50.594 --> 16:53.180
Why don't you come off that cross,
cos we need the wood.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.224
Ok?

16:57.935 --> 16:59.061
Later.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.439
Give your mum my love.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.607
Will do.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.045
Fuck.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.014
Hey, what's going on, dally?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.809
- Your brother here?
- Yeah, come on in.

20:34.318 --> 20:35.944
So what we lookin' at here?

20:38.864 --> 20:39.865
Ida Walker.

20:40.490 --> 20:44.077
Doing 25 now for felony murder
and conspiracy

20:44.244 --> 20:46.622
went untouched for nearly
three decades.

20:46.747 --> 20:49.833
Anything major went down,
her name always came up.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.587
Kind of like a female
Jimmy hoffa around here.

20:53.754 --> 20:56.840
Only person who'd been able to
unionise all the different crews

20:56.924 --> 20:58.091
when she needed to.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.468
So what went wrong?

21:00.385 --> 21:01.720
Went for a bank

21:01.970 --> 21:03.013
things got out of hand

21:03.430 --> 21:06.808
her husband, James Walker,
was killed in a shootout.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.227
Wife got away?

21:08.352 --> 21:11.188
She operated remotely,
he was the floor general.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.065
That way,
there was always an alibi.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.315
Smart.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.110
Officers at the scene said James
was giving cover to someone.

21:17.402 --> 21:18.402
They got away.

21:19.071 --> 21:20.155
Most likely...

21:20.948 --> 21:21.948
Dallas Walker.

21:22.908 --> 21:25.702
James' younger brother
and true cowboy.

21:26.370 --> 21:29.122
Ex-con, done time
for manslaughter

21:29.206 --> 21:31.333
four counts of aggravated dui

21:31.416 --> 21:34.044
disorderly,
jackets thicker than the niv.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.046
Where's this one now?

21:36.129 --> 21:38.382
He's been out mostly
the last five years.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.260
Which brings me to
the golden boy

21:41.426 --> 21:42.594
Wyatt Walker.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.346
Ida and James' son.

21:44.555 --> 21:45.806
Dallas' nephew.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.059
You mind answering me something?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.770
Just how the hell did you
get mixed up with this?

21:53.438 --> 21:54.481
Fell in love.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.861
So what's your wife think
of this mess?

21:59.695 --> 22:01.363
I'm a law man, Lawrence.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.532
She knows who she married.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.796
What the fuck is the problem, Benny?

22:59.880 --> 23:02.174
Do I really need to tell you

23:02.341 --> 23:05.719
that this state
does not like your family?

23:07.930 --> 23:10.224
Even with your mother
under their care

23:11.183 --> 23:13.227
since things...

23:13.977 --> 23:17.314
Have continued to "be misplaced".

23:18.357 --> 23:21.318
I think they really understand
how far

23:21.401 --> 23:22.694
- her reach goes.
- Benny.

23:22.778 --> 23:26.615
And that does not coincide
with their idea of rehabilitation.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.738
Can you get me a list
of who's on that parole board?

23:29.743 --> 23:31.578
Oh, Jesus...

23:31.828 --> 23:32.913
- You...
- Come on, Benny.

23:33.872 --> 23:35.558
After everything
this family's done for you?

23:35.582 --> 23:37.167
I am going to plead

23:37.251 --> 23:39.419
that 12 years is
enough punishment.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.630
With this illness,
she should be let go...

23:41.713 --> 23:44.591
- That's not gonna be good enough, Benny.
- Well, that's our best shot.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.385
I'm gonna need that list, Benny.

23:49.304 --> 23:50.597
Hey, Benny. Look at me, man.

23:50.764 --> 23:51.807
Hey.

23:52.516 --> 23:53.559
Hey.

23:54.059 --> 23:54.935
Benny.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.104
She didn't want you
carrying this around.

23:57.604 --> 23:59.189
I'm gonna need
that fuckin' list.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.445
Ok?

24:45.861 --> 24:46.904
Fuck!

25:22.940 --> 25:24.274
You got anything to say?

25:24.733 --> 25:25.734
Nope.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.324
I was thirsty.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.496
Come on.

25:38.997 --> 25:40.666
Your mum's worried sick
about you.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.502
<i>13-50,
reports of unconscious, unresponsive</i>

25:43.710 --> 25:46.046
<i>10-54, 10-54...</i>

25:49.383 --> 25:50.926
Got an ID on the address?

25:51.802 --> 25:54.596
<i>13-50,
address is registered to a Randall bird.</i>

25:55.597 --> 25:57.766
Copy that, I'm en route.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.061
What's a 10-54?

26:02.354 --> 26:03.397
A body.

26:10.946 --> 26:12.739
- Stay in the car.
- Ok.

26:13.574 --> 26:15.701
I got nowhere to be.
Take all the time you want.

26:48.859 --> 26:50.110
He's a big boy.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.404
He is.

26:52.529 --> 26:54.031
You say he's got a brother?

26:54.156 --> 26:56.366
Jay.

26:59.411 --> 27:00.579
Lives here too.

27:01.580 --> 27:02.706
Well, come on.

27:02.789 --> 27:03.916
There's more.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.473
You know this gal?

27:21.767 --> 27:25.354
Looks familiar.
Don't know her though.

27:27.356 --> 27:30.359
Judging by the tat, she's with
one of the peckerwood crews.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.322
Forty-five.

27:35.781 --> 27:38.367
Whoever did this is one
cold-blooded murderer.

27:39.368 --> 27:40.786
Is the brother the kind?

27:41.578 --> 27:43.497
Kill his own family and a girl?

27:43.705 --> 27:46.333
Jay can't chew gum
and walk at the same time.

27:47.167 --> 27:49.419
His brother over there,
on the other hand, bird

27:50.003 --> 27:51.713
he was a mean son of a bitch.

27:52.923 --> 27:55.551
Easily could've made someone
mad enough to do this.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.555
So you figure these two brothers
are the ones in on the job?

28:00.138 --> 28:01.765
In my mind, without a doubt.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.601
Someone's trying to clean up.

28:05.811 --> 28:09.356
Her? Just wrong place, wrong time.

28:11.149 --> 28:14.278
Looks to me like
little brother got scared

28:14.361 --> 28:16.238
and made out across this field.

28:17.197 --> 28:18.866
Log this, get me ballistics.

28:18.949 --> 28:22.077
Put an apb out on Jason bird,
goes by "Jay".

28:23.745 --> 28:25.080
I don't know what else to do.

28:26.081 --> 28:28.041
Who the fuck
acts like this, Darla?

28:28.458 --> 28:29.668
Drinking at school...

28:29.751 --> 28:30.961
It was one beer!

28:31.044 --> 28:33.255
I don't give a shit if it was one beer,
you're 15!

28:34.173 --> 28:36.317
That's twice in the last two weeks
you've been sent home.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.552
I-I'm done,
I don't know what to do.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.304
You don't have to do anything.

28:40.387 --> 28:42.306
Yes, of course I do!
Darla, I'm your mother!

28:42.389 --> 28:44.641
- Just... no, just let me be!
- I don't wanna let...

28:45.017 --> 28:46.017
Of course, I'm sorry

28:46.059 --> 28:47.662
that's right, I should just...
I should just let you be.

28:47.686 --> 28:49.914
Alright, Darla, why don't you tell me,
what are you gonna do?

28:49.938 --> 28:51.106
What are you gonna do?

28:52.107 --> 28:54.067
I'm so sick of this,
I'm getting out of here.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.530
I guess we'll see you later then!

29:00.949 --> 29:01.949
I...

29:46.453 --> 29:47.453
Hey.

29:48.664 --> 29:49.664
Hey.

29:51.667 --> 29:52.835
I know you, don't I?

29:54.545 --> 29:55.587
Yeah...

29:55.921 --> 29:58.423
I go to Edison,
we had a class last year.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.384
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

30:00.551 --> 30:01.969
That's right,
that's how I know you.

30:03.637 --> 30:04.847
What're you doin' out here?

30:07.140 --> 30:08.183
Nothin'.

30:09.893 --> 30:10.894
Nothin', huh?

30:13.438 --> 30:14.439
That's fun.

30:15.148 --> 30:17.734
I was, uh, actually...

30:18.026 --> 30:20.696
Hoping to find someone here
that would help me buy me some beer.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.198
You, uh...

30:24.241 --> 30:25.951
You don't happen to have
a fake ID, do you?

30:27.661 --> 30:28.704
No.

30:29.705 --> 30:30.706
Oh.

30:31.957 --> 30:32.958
That's just too bad.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.504
Guess I'll be seeing you around.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.386
What kinda beer do you like?

30:48.765 --> 30:50.642
How's it going tonight,
my friend?

30:51.685 --> 30:53.729
I'm doing good.
I can't complain.

30:53.979 --> 30:56.273
I'll be a lot better
when I get some cigarettes.

30:57.274 --> 31:00.736
Ah, well, that is the question.
What kind of cigarette? Yeah.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.322
I don't know exactly
what kind I want.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.991
You got some things
I've never seen before, like, um...

31:06.283 --> 31:08.035
What's that black packet
you got down there?

31:10.746 --> 31:13.123
Well, beside it.
Right beside it.

31:13.457 --> 31:16.001
See, that's the one.
What is that orange thing? What is that?

31:16.960 --> 31:18.504
Yeah, no, no. Over to the right.

31:18.754 --> 31:20.380
Tell you what,
behind... beneath it.

31:21.465 --> 31:22.508
Beneath it.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.177
Below it, below it.

31:31.725 --> 31:33.328
So you gonna tell me where
the fuck you learned

31:33.352 --> 31:34.436
how to do all that?

31:34.520 --> 31:35.646
Light a cigarette?

31:36.230 --> 31:37.439
What you did in the store

31:37.523 --> 31:39.525
as far as procuring this beer

31:39.608 --> 31:40.859
that we have here.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.569
You crazy.

31:44.905 --> 31:47.032
That's good, though.
Crazy's good.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.160
I like crazy.

31:53.121 --> 31:56.333
You wanna, um...
Grab some food or something?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.501
You hungry?

31:59.336 --> 32:01.129
Sure.

32:01.213 --> 32:02.464
You alright?

32:02.756 --> 32:05.551
Yeah, I think we should
probably get some food in your belly.

32:37.499 --> 32:38.792
The fucker got away.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.337
What do you mean?

32:42.588 --> 32:45.090
I mean he jumped out the fucking back.
I'll find him.

32:45.174 --> 32:46.633
I'll fucking find him, but...

32:48.218 --> 32:51.346
Birdy and the driver are done.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.211
- If bodie finds him before we do...
- I'm gonna find him.

32:54.308 --> 32:55.767
- I'm gonna find him.
- Fuck, man!

32:55.851 --> 32:57.328
- Hey.
- I can't deal with this right now.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.980
You don't need to fucking deal
with it, man. Just fucking relax.

33:00.105 --> 33:01.940
Alright? I will fucking find him.

33:02.733 --> 33:03.901
Eat something.

33:04.401 --> 33:05.485
I'm not hungry.

33:07.738 --> 33:09.448
Got your fucking period
or something?

33:20.876 --> 33:22.169
It's ma...

33:27.424 --> 33:28.592
She's getting worse.

33:34.765 --> 33:35.891
She doesn't have long.

33:42.272 --> 33:43.357
Fuck.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.068
Fuck.

33:56.703 --> 33:57.829
What're you gonna do?

33:59.498 --> 34:00.916
I'm gonna get her the fuck out.

34:04.253 --> 34:05.337
Sounds good.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.357
Look at this.

34:31.446 --> 34:32.739
- Huh.
- Hey.

34:34.324 --> 34:35.492
What's this?

34:37.034 --> 34:38.495
Getting some food. So what?

34:40.455 --> 34:41.706
I'm Pete, sir.

34:45.627 --> 34:47.920
Pete, this is my uncles,
Dallas and Wyatt.

34:53.135 --> 34:54.261
Sit down.

34:55.971 --> 34:57.514
We're fine, just gonna eat.

34:57.598 --> 34:59.600
No, I said, sit down.

34:59.850 --> 35:01.643
Let us buy you kids some food.

35:05.898 --> 35:06.940
Ok.

35:07.441 --> 35:08.650
- Alrighty.
- Come on.

35:10.694 --> 35:13.280
Anyway, so she calls me
from the nurse's office, you know

35:13.363 --> 35:15.991
she gives me some bs story
that she's sick

35:16.074 --> 35:17.409
which she did all the time

35:17.659 --> 35:20.037
and she tells me, she said it
like six times, she says

35:20.120 --> 35:21.600
"I need you to wait
by the gym doors."

35:22.247 --> 35:23.540
So I said, "alright, alright."

35:23.624 --> 35:25.375
So I'm waiting and waiting
and waiting

35:25.459 --> 35:29.171
and she comes busting out
of the gym door

35:29.254 --> 35:30.814
and she's got five friends
following her

35:30.839 --> 35:32.567
and they jump in the back
of my truck, right?

35:32.591 --> 35:34.551
So I peel out, man

35:34.635 --> 35:38.055
and i'm... they're screaming at me
like crazy girls.

35:38.138 --> 35:39.556
"Drive! Drive! Drive!"

35:39.640 --> 35:43.769
And I almost hit that... you remember
that principal with the thing in his...?

35:43.852 --> 35:45.604
I almost hit the principal's car.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.232
And we tear ass
across the football field

35:48.440 --> 35:50.317
I tear the whole football field up

35:50.400 --> 35:51.860
and we drive to the lake, man.

35:51.944 --> 35:54.238
We spent the entire night

35:54.321 --> 35:56.198
into the early morning,
at the lake.

35:56.365 --> 35:57.574
We had the greatest night.

35:57.741 --> 35:59.535
Her friends were crazy.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.704
Anyway, the next morning

36:03.539 --> 36:04.915
your grandma found out.

36:05.791 --> 36:07.584
And she kicked
the living shit outta me.

36:07.668 --> 36:09.628
I mean, it was
the worst ass-whooping

36:09.711 --> 36:11.672
I have gotten to this day.

36:13.757 --> 36:14.758
My mum did that?

36:14.842 --> 36:16.093
Your mama did that.

36:17.177 --> 36:18.595
You know she loved me, right?

36:18.679 --> 36:21.390
You know that, I mean,
that's why your name is Darla

36:21.473 --> 36:23.475
because it's the closest
chick name to "Dallas".

36:23.559 --> 36:25.394
- Stupid.
- That's a fact. I'm tellin' ya!

36:25.477 --> 36:26.663
- Stupid.
- Where you from, Pete?

36:26.687 --> 36:27.729
Ask her!

36:28.313 --> 36:29.398
From bristow.

36:29.481 --> 36:30.357
Bristow.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.025
You got a job
up there in bristow?

36:32.985 --> 36:37.072
Yeah, I'm the, um, assistant manager
over at the lot a burger.

36:37.155 --> 36:38.323
Oh!

36:38.448 --> 36:39.908
Man!

36:39.992 --> 36:42.744
Petey's assistant manager,
bringin' in the big bucks.

36:42.828 --> 36:43.829
Yes, sir.

36:43.912 --> 36:45.539
Alright, well, you be good
to our girl.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.207
- Ya hear?
- We are just friends.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.168
Whatever you say.

36:49.251 --> 36:50.251
I want change.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.088
See you later, baby girl.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.215
- Bye.
- Hey, thank y'all for dinner.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.387
I'm sorry.

37:01.346 --> 37:04.183
It's alright, it's alright.
Nah, for real, it's...

37:04.725 --> 37:06.560
Very interesting. It was fun.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.188
The whole time that...

37:09.521 --> 37:11.398
I was sitting there,
I just kept thinking...

37:12.441 --> 37:13.609
That you're pretty cute.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.111
You're just scared of my uncles.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.155
No. Well...

37:19.489 --> 37:20.657
Maybe a little bit.

37:21.783 --> 37:23.493
But you sure are pretty,
miss Darla.

37:25.621 --> 37:27.039
You're pretty cute too.

37:28.540 --> 37:29.750
I like that necklace.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.169
Oh, thank you. It's the, uh...

37:33.712 --> 37:36.507
Suppose the only thing
my dad ever left me, so, uh...

37:37.841 --> 37:39.259
Guess that makes it sacred.

37:42.971 --> 37:44.515
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

37:45.849 --> 37:46.892
Alright.

37:58.695 --> 37:59.696
Hi.

38:01.198 --> 38:02.282
What're you doin'?

38:04.326 --> 38:05.869
You gonna trap me back here?

38:06.787 --> 38:08.080
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

38:09.915 --> 38:11.458
If you let me.

39:03.552 --> 39:04.970
I warned him, I warned him.

39:30.454 --> 39:33.624
- Hands! Show me your fuckin' hands!
- Alright, alright.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.586
Everything in the register.

39:40.005 --> 39:42.090
Put the money into the hat.

39:53.894 --> 39:55.521
No, wait!

40:03.111 --> 40:04.696
Fuck! Fuck!

40:08.700 --> 40:09.826
Fuck.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.458
No, no.

40:30.055 --> 40:31.098
Hey!

40:31.473 --> 40:32.599
Don't I know you?

40:33.141 --> 40:35.018
You're that lawyer guy
from TV, right?

40:35.227 --> 40:36.228
Prince and prince?

40:36.311 --> 40:37.747
- Prince and prince.
- Stewart prince.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.022
Stewart prince! That's right.

40:39.106 --> 40:40.440
Hey, I got a question for ya.

40:41.567 --> 40:42.693
Do you do duis?

40:52.244 --> 40:53.871
Come on. Alright, big guy.

40:54.538 --> 40:55.706
You alright, stew?

40:56.582 --> 40:57.582
Huh?

40:58.333 --> 41:00.520
Hey, listen to me,
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions

41:00.544 --> 41:02.296
and I want you to nod, "yes"

41:02.963 --> 41:04.006
and "no".

41:04.548 --> 41:05.549
Alright?

41:06.258 --> 41:07.384
Alright.

41:08.969 --> 41:10.679
You on the parole board, right, stew?

41:12.222 --> 41:14.433
I imagine you take that job
real serious.

41:15.976 --> 41:17.186
Right. Ok.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.444
You know, there's a woman
up for parole next week.

41:25.569 --> 41:26.862
You know who she is, right?

41:28.280 --> 41:29.281
Yeah.

41:32.117 --> 41:33.410
She's sick, stew.

41:35.954 --> 41:37.206
She's really sick.

41:38.624 --> 41:41.376
We don't think she should spend
her last days in a cage.

41:42.794 --> 41:43.921
Know what I mean?

41:45.589 --> 41:46.715
Hold out your hands.

41:48.717 --> 41:50.469
Hold out your goddamn hands!

41:55.516 --> 41:56.642
Good.

41:57.851 --> 41:59.019
Good.

42:00.646 --> 42:01.688
Palms up.

42:08.195 --> 42:09.321
You feel that?

42:11.448 --> 42:12.950
You feel that?

42:18.205 --> 42:19.331
Hey, you alright.

42:19.873 --> 42:20.873
Look at it.

42:21.250 --> 42:22.960
Look at it, look at it,
look at it.

42:23.043 --> 42:24.920
It's $100,000, stew.

42:26.588 --> 42:28.632
I could've given you
a lot less, but...

42:29.716 --> 42:33.637
I want you to know how much...
How much you're appreciated.

42:35.097 --> 42:36.097
You hear?

42:37.891 --> 42:39.393
That woman has a family.

42:41.270 --> 42:44.031
Person'll do anything to protect
their family, isn't that right, stew?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.440
Right?

42:47.651 --> 42:49.820
Hey, hey, look at me.

42:52.948 --> 42:54.199
You got pretty skin.

42:58.328 --> 43:00.038
I'm glad
we had this little chat.

43:00.998 --> 43:02.040
Ok?

43:03.250 --> 43:05.961
Unfortunately you're gonna have
to find your own ride home, though

43:06.044 --> 43:07.087
alright, stew?

43:08.213 --> 43:09.256
Alright, stew?

43:43.999 --> 43:45.125
Hop in, baby girl.

43:52.090 --> 43:54.885
Have her back by the afternoon,
please, she's grounded.

43:54.968 --> 43:56.136
Uh-oh. What now?

43:57.429 --> 43:59.723
Don't ask. Where you guys goin'?

44:00.182 --> 44:03.268
Uh, what do ya say, kiddo?
Mall maybe, get some food?

44:03.977 --> 44:06.271
Go. Spend some time with bodie.

44:08.273 --> 44:10.234
Alright. See you later.

44:11.401 --> 44:13.237
Happy father's day, bodie!

44:21.036 --> 44:24.039
What's up with that kid,
you seein' him now or what?

44:24.831 --> 44:25.874
I don't...

44:26.708 --> 44:27.751
Alright.

44:29.628 --> 44:31.922
- Just be smart, don't get your heart broke.
- I know.

44:34.466 --> 44:35.968
- You smoke now?
- What?

44:36.677 --> 44:37.845
Give me one of those.

44:55.863 --> 44:57.531
What's my mum's deal
with grandma?

45:01.326 --> 45:02.452
It's complicated.

45:02.744 --> 45:04.663
Oh, thanks,
I heard that one before.

45:10.043 --> 45:11.920
When your grandfather died

45:12.004 --> 45:14.756
your mum got pretty upset
with grandma.

45:17.009 --> 45:18.427
And they haven't talked since.

45:22.931 --> 45:24.099
Sometimes...

45:26.768 --> 45:27.895
Good people...

45:29.271 --> 45:31.982
Don't understand
why other good people do...

45:34.151 --> 45:35.277
Bad things.

45:37.487 --> 45:38.655
Like Rob people.

45:40.782 --> 45:41.825
I guess.

45:43.118 --> 45:44.536
You Rob people, don't you?

45:47.456 --> 45:48.957
I'm not gonna say anything.

45:50.584 --> 45:52.252
So why do you do it? I guess.

45:58.008 --> 46:00.469
When your grandpa came back
from being in the army

46:01.220 --> 46:03.180
he didn't come back
to any high-paying job.

46:04.806 --> 46:06.350
There wasn't much opportunity.

46:10.187 --> 46:11.605
So they did what they had to do.

46:14.608 --> 46:16.109
I asked why you did it.

46:20.447 --> 46:21.698
Well, it's in our blood.

46:25.619 --> 46:27.663
What's she like? Grandma?

46:50.143 --> 46:51.353
Hey, baby.

46:51.979 --> 46:53.188
Just went and saw dad.

46:53.689 --> 46:55.190
Oh, yeah? How's he doin'?

46:55.274 --> 46:57.401
Oh, just fine.

47:01.113 --> 47:02.322
And I went and saw Benson.

47:03.657 --> 47:05.033
Oh, shit...

47:10.581 --> 47:11.999
Why didn't you tell me, mum?

47:12.082 --> 47:15.043
You never know what's true
with these fuckin' doctors.

47:17.462 --> 47:18.589
How bad is it?

47:24.011 --> 47:25.387
It's not good, hon.

47:28.140 --> 47:29.474
We're gonna get you paroled.

47:30.517 --> 47:32.686
I'm gonna get you
the best doctors money can buy.

47:33.729 --> 47:34.729
Hey.

47:35.606 --> 47:37.983
I'm not going
to any doctors, Wyatt.

47:44.448 --> 47:45.657
How long?

47:47.409 --> 47:49.453
Just don't let me die in here.

47:52.539 --> 47:53.707
You promise me?

47:55.501 --> 47:56.627
Not in here.

47:57.336 --> 47:58.337
I promise.

48:01.048 --> 48:02.132
Listen...

48:03.300 --> 48:04.384
Something came up.

48:06.595 --> 48:07.596
What is it?

48:07.679 --> 48:09.097
Wyatt, look at me.

48:10.682 --> 48:12.017
This is serious.

48:13.519 --> 48:16.021
You might have to make
some difficult choices.

48:17.231 --> 48:18.690
But if you're smart

48:20.234 --> 48:22.361
you won't ever have to
do this again.

48:22.861 --> 48:24.738
You understand what I'm sayin'?

48:26.073 --> 48:27.115
Yeah.

48:29.451 --> 48:32.204
Your father and I
never wanted this for you.

48:36.750 --> 48:38.293
But you're too much like him.

48:38.794 --> 48:40.671
Jesus, you would have
done it anyway.

48:43.882 --> 48:44.967
Wyatt.

48:55.102 --> 48:56.395
They know you're coming.

48:57.604 --> 48:58.897
Take uncle with you.

48:59.982 --> 49:01.024
Ok.

49:04.152 --> 49:05.737
I love you, sweetheart.

49:07.739 --> 49:08.949
I love you too, ma.

49:11.451 --> 49:13.412
Hey, there's someone
I want you to meet.

49:15.539 --> 49:16.539
Come on.

49:29.761 --> 49:31.263
Hi.

49:32.139 --> 49:36.268
It... it's nice
to finally meet you.

49:38.103 --> 49:39.103
Um...

49:39.271 --> 49:41.273
Wyatt took me
to visit grandpa today.

49:42.900 --> 49:43.900
He did?

49:44.318 --> 49:46.153
Yeah. We go, um...

49:47.154 --> 49:48.530
Like every father's day.

49:51.450 --> 49:54.536
I wanna know
everything about you.

50:02.669 --> 50:04.213
Pretty cut and dry, Jay.

50:05.714 --> 50:07.633
I never wanted to kill nobody.

50:10.135 --> 50:12.304
I was just scaring 'em,
that's it.

50:14.264 --> 50:15.933
Two fathers in cold blood.

50:17.434 --> 50:18.810
Let me ask you something.

50:19.895 --> 50:22.648
That pretty little girl
back there in the trailer...

50:24.191 --> 50:25.275
You know

50:25.609 --> 50:27.319
the one all shot to shit...

50:28.737 --> 50:29.905
That your girlfriend?

50:32.115 --> 50:34.743
Looked to me like you let out running
across that field

50:34.826 --> 50:36.537
like a scared jackrabbit.

50:40.541 --> 50:42.876
Now, why don't you do
a decent thing in your life

50:44.044 --> 50:46.713
and tell me what the hell happened
in that trailer, boy.

50:50.759 --> 50:52.052
I didn't see nothin'.

50:56.223 --> 50:57.223
I...

50:58.475 --> 51:00.143
Just heard the voice
and the shot

51:00.227 --> 51:03.146
and the next thing I know
i'm... I'm running through the field.

51:03.272 --> 51:04.606
Whose voice did you hear?

51:11.154 --> 51:12.906
Oh, it don't matter no how.

51:14.908 --> 51:16.660
I'm dead regardless.

51:18.704 --> 51:20.289
Whose voice?

51:24.293 --> 51:25.752
Dallas Walker.

51:34.052 --> 51:35.345
You didn't see him though?

51:38.307 --> 51:40.058
Nah, but it was him.

51:43.562 --> 51:45.731
You in on that va truck job too?

51:50.611 --> 51:51.737
Yes, sir.

51:52.613 --> 51:53.613
Who was there?

51:55.908 --> 51:59.328
Me, bird, Dallas

51:59.912 --> 52:01.038
and Wyatt.

52:04.458 --> 52:06.877
We're all just working
for the old lady anyhow.

52:09.087 --> 52:11.673
Acting like he's
somebody else is fuckin' stupid.

52:15.010 --> 52:17.012
We talkin' about
giving me the chair?

52:19.515 --> 52:20.599
Fuck.

52:25.479 --> 52:26.980
You know, you wanna do someone...

52:28.732 --> 52:29.775
Do her.

52:31.693 --> 52:33.237
You wanna change some shit...

52:36.365 --> 52:37.491
Do her.

52:42.246 --> 52:44.248
You know, I can't be saying
nothing more

52:44.331 --> 52:46.333
until I... until I get
some insurances.

52:46.458 --> 52:47.668
Well, that's just fine.

52:49.002 --> 52:50.546
But while you're on a roll

52:50.629 --> 52:53.549
singing like a canary, why don't you
tell me just one more thing?

52:55.384 --> 52:57.386
Who do you reckon went to
that hospital

52:58.554 --> 53:00.472
and killed that guard
in cold blood?

53:06.311 --> 53:07.563
Dallas Walker.

53:24.663 --> 53:26.790
There he is.
How you doin', kiddo?

53:27.457 --> 53:29.251
What's up, dal,
what're you doin'?

53:29.334 --> 53:30.711
Man, you been workin' out?

53:31.420 --> 53:32.546
Yeah, maybe a little.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.756
What's up, man?
I'm just chilling, man.

53:35.215 --> 53:36.925
- What you been up to?
- Oh, you know

53:37.217 --> 53:39.636
not much. You, uh, you heard
what happened to bird?

53:40.387 --> 53:41.263
Yeah.

53:41.346 --> 53:43.223
- Yeah.
- Yeah, man, that's fucked up.

53:43.473 --> 53:44.933
- I know.
- You heard anything?

53:45.392 --> 53:46.977
Haven't heard a goddamn thing, man.

53:47.144 --> 53:49.104
I'm looking for Jay, man.
You seen him?

53:49.813 --> 53:50.856
Jay...

53:53.066 --> 53:55.444
Yeah, well. I mean, the cops
rolled him, man, you know.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.070
- I mean...
- What? What?

53:57.487 --> 53:58.780
Well, he hit that minute mart.

53:58.864 --> 54:00.365
- When?
- You know, he... well, he...

54:00.616 --> 54:02.242
Just, I don't know,
was it yesterday?

54:02.701 --> 54:05.078
He b... he blasted the cashier

54:05.579 --> 54:08.123
then some dude comin'
out the shitter, man!

54:08.207 --> 54:09.541
I mean, goddamn!

54:09.666 --> 54:11.251
- Oh, man.
- The guy's fuckin' nuts.

54:11.335 --> 54:12.794
- Locked him up, huh?
- Yeah.

54:12.961 --> 54:14.588
- Oh, yeah.
- Stupid motherfucker.

54:14.671 --> 54:15.923
Yeah, he is, man. I know.

54:16.006 --> 54:17.591
Does he... does he know about bird?

54:19.009 --> 54:20.612
- You know what, I don't know.
- You don't know?

54:20.636 --> 54:23.972
No, I haven't left this fuckin' house
in like a... a week.

54:24.056 --> 54:26.308
Yeah. Smells like it, man.

54:26.808 --> 54:27.851
You wanna come inside?

54:27.935 --> 54:29.895
I ain't comin' in
that fuckin' place, come on.

54:30.187 --> 54:32.856
Put a shirt on, man.
I'll catch you next time, man.

54:32.940 --> 54:34.107
Alright, alright, brother.

54:34.191 --> 54:36.351
- See you next time. Good to see ya.
- Thanks, brother.

54:50.916 --> 54:52.167
If you testify...

54:53.001 --> 54:54.586
I can keep you off death row.

55:00.050 --> 55:01.593
Can I get my cigarettes?

57:13.517 --> 57:14.601
Ok.

57:21.108 --> 57:22.568
Put your hands on the dash.

57:22.776 --> 57:23.819
Both of 'em.

57:31.368 --> 57:32.368
What now?

57:33.495 --> 57:34.538
Just sit still.

57:48.010 --> 57:49.303
Look straight ahead.

57:50.679 --> 57:52.431
And don't move.

58:32.554 --> 58:33.722
Look at that.

59:06.672 --> 59:08.173
You boys took the wrong turn.

59:09.258 --> 59:10.634
We're lookin' for someone.

59:11.885 --> 59:12.886
Who's that?

59:15.430 --> 59:16.431
No idea.

59:18.141 --> 59:19.434
Who the fuck sent you?

59:20.060 --> 59:21.061
Ida red.

59:28.986 --> 59:30.028
Follow me.

59:42.499 --> 59:43.584
Take a seat.

59:45.335 --> 59:47.462
So, your... your mama sent you.

59:48.046 --> 59:49.047
That's right.

59:50.674 --> 59:51.800
What do you got for us?

59:54.344 --> 59:55.846
Few things you need to know.

59:56.263 --> 1:00:00.058
We can 10% off the top
with a 500k advance.

1:00:01.018 --> 1:00:02.018
$500,000?

1:00:03.020 --> 1:00:04.020
That's right.

1:00:04.938 --> 1:00:07.441
Job like this,
I gotta mitigate my risk.

1:00:08.275 --> 1:00:11.987
Uh, well, I gotta tell ya,
I don't have that kind of cash on hand.

1:00:12.112 --> 1:00:13.112
I figured.

1:00:14.907 --> 1:00:17.910
Also figured
that if we make a deal.

1:00:18.869 --> 1:00:20.454
I can take you at your word.

1:00:22.789 --> 1:00:24.041
Well, how much is this job?

1:00:25.626 --> 1:00:26.710
Ten million.

1:00:27.169 --> 1:00:28.712
Ten million?

1:00:29.004 --> 1:00:30.714
That's right. Maybe more.

1:00:34.134 --> 1:00:35.260
What else you got?

1:00:37.679 --> 1:00:41.934
Every month, a private jet flies
into sand Springs from the middle east.

1:00:42.601 --> 1:00:45.979
A group of oil men take
a monthly trip for...

1:00:47.022 --> 1:00:48.941
Deals, meetings, what have you.

1:00:50.734 --> 1:00:52.819
What makes this our business,
is that

1:00:53.237 --> 1:00:57.449
on these planes,
they bring back cash. Lots of it.

1:00:58.408 --> 1:01:01.662
Money from deals
they don't report.

1:01:04.331 --> 1:01:05.874
And how do you know about this?

1:01:08.669 --> 1:01:11.463
Some people say I'm a psychic.

1:01:17.886 --> 1:01:19.388
Yeah, well, cash like that

1:01:19.471 --> 1:01:21.431
I imagine is tight security, right?

1:01:21.515 --> 1:01:22.975
Maybe some ex-military?

1:01:23.433 --> 1:01:24.434
Yeah, a few.

1:01:25.143 --> 1:01:26.645
They ain't young bucks either.

1:01:28.105 --> 1:01:29.648
It's a private airport too.

1:01:30.524 --> 1:01:33.527
Flights come in around
three in the morning.

1:01:33.902 --> 1:01:34.902
Ghost town.

1:01:35.863 --> 1:01:37.281
But, uh...

1:01:37.781 --> 1:01:39.408
I mean, forgive me but...

1:01:41.201 --> 1:01:43.829
Something's not right here,
why's the security so lax?

1:01:45.664 --> 1:01:49.918
People like this been kings
their whole lives.

1:01:50.586 --> 1:01:53.005
Money and power
is a birth right.

1:01:54.381 --> 1:01:56.216
You live like that
long enough and...

1:01:57.384 --> 1:01:58.385
You get slow.

1:01:59.428 --> 1:02:02.014
You don't think
bad things can happen to you.

1:02:03.056 --> 1:02:04.266
What kind of plane is it?

1:02:04.725 --> 1:02:06.894
Big boy, it's a g5.

1:02:07.227 --> 1:02:09.229
Motherfucker fresh off the lot.

1:02:12.191 --> 1:02:14.359
How do we know this ain't
a bunch of bullshit?

1:02:15.319 --> 1:02:16.361
You don't.

1:02:17.738 --> 1:02:19.031
But I have this.

1:02:21.491 --> 1:02:22.868
Ah...

1:02:23.619 --> 1:02:24.912
We don't have a deal yet.

1:02:33.128 --> 1:02:34.630
A psychic, huh?

1:02:35.923 --> 1:02:37.216
That's what people say.

1:02:37.925 --> 1:02:40.511
What you're talkin' about here
is a fuckin' rodeo.

1:02:41.512 --> 1:02:42.888
It's a smash and grab.

1:02:43.138 --> 1:02:47.518
Hey, look, as of now,
I'm the only one who's worked this.

1:02:50.771 --> 1:02:53.440
Well, I'm the only one's
gotta kill people.

1:02:53.649 --> 1:02:55.150
Hey, that's your business.

1:02:55.901 --> 1:02:59.738
But you're acting like you're
the only cowboys around here.

1:03:01.365 --> 1:03:04.034
You, uh, forget where you are?

1:03:20.342 --> 1:03:22.386
- We could use another guy.
- Another guy?

1:03:23.387 --> 1:03:26.557
A couple of security and some
wonder bread businessmen? Fuck that.

1:03:28.976 --> 1:03:30.519
Can't afford another slip, though.

1:03:30.644 --> 1:03:32.563
No. I'll check it all out.

1:03:35.858 --> 1:03:37.776
It's like your ma said, man,
we do this

1:03:38.610 --> 1:03:40.070
we're fucking done, man.

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:41.363
We're done.

1:03:41.572 --> 1:03:43.532
That's it. I'm gone.

1:03:47.786 --> 1:03:49.580
I'm getting too old
for this shit, man.

1:04:04.803 --> 1:04:07.014
Hey, don't talk about my hair,
curly sue.

1:04:07.097 --> 1:04:08.432
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:09.784
Don't hold that shit over me.

1:04:09.808 --> 1:04:11.101
Do not hold that shit over me.

1:04:12.978 --> 1:04:14.418
That's happening.
I don't give a fuck

1:04:14.605 --> 1:04:17.274
if I strip you down
and I fuck you up in this parking lot.

1:04:18.358 --> 1:04:20.652
Hey, you lost, little girl?

1:04:22.196 --> 1:04:23.196
Hey, petey.

1:04:24.907 --> 1:04:25.907
'Sup.

1:04:28.368 --> 1:04:29.995
What's your name? I'm so sorry.

1:04:30.454 --> 1:04:31.538
Darla.

1:04:33.290 --> 1:04:35.375
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1:04:36.001 --> 1:04:37.836
Is this the girl
you tagged in the bathroom?

1:04:40.631 --> 1:04:43.550
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.

1:04:45.677 --> 1:04:46.677
Say, I, uh...

1:04:47.429 --> 1:04:49.029
Bet there's a bathroom
in the bingo hall.

1:04:49.264 --> 1:04:51.016
Wanna give me the tour, baby...

1:04:51.141 --> 1:04:52.809
Fuck!

1:04:53.393 --> 1:04:55.187
What the fuck was that?

1:05:15.874 --> 1:05:17.167
- Howdy.
- Hey!

1:05:17.376 --> 1:05:18.418
What can I help you with?

1:05:18.710 --> 1:05:21.129
I am interested
in some rental and storage space

1:05:21.213 --> 1:05:23.590
and I was hoping
you could give me a look around.

1:05:23.757 --> 1:05:25.717
Sure thing.
Would you like some coffee?

1:05:26.218 --> 1:05:27.594
Ah, coffee would be great.

1:05:27.719 --> 1:05:29.054
My name's Lionel, by the way.

1:05:29.137 --> 1:05:31.390
Lionel, I'm sleighton.
Sleighton James.

1:05:32.391 --> 1:05:34.560
- What do you fly?
- Uh, cardinal.

1:05:35.310 --> 1:05:36.895
177?

1:05:37.271 --> 1:05:38.272
Og.

1:05:38.730 --> 1:05:40.023
- Good plane.
- Yeah.

1:05:40.816 --> 1:05:42.943
Well, this is
our medium-sized hangar.

1:05:43.569 --> 1:05:45.487
Might be a little big
for your cardinal.

1:05:45.696 --> 1:05:47.656
Well, it seems nice.
What's security like?

1:05:48.198 --> 1:05:50.284
Minimal, that's kinda up to you.

1:05:50.701 --> 1:05:52.995
Most of our clientele
prefer it that way.

1:05:53.328 --> 1:05:56.957
I'm here at 5 in the morning and
I have somebody shut it down at 9pm.

1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.334
Ah. No action after hours?

1:05:59.835 --> 1:06:02.713
Oh sure, I'd just have to set you up
with a key card.

1:06:02.796 --> 1:06:04.590
Ok. Yeah.

1:06:05.966 --> 1:06:07.301
No cameras in here, Lionel?

1:06:07.551 --> 1:06:11.180
I've got two, one on the tarmac
that looks down on the fuelling station

1:06:11.263 --> 1:06:13.682
and one that looks down
on the flight office and that's it.

1:06:13.765 --> 1:06:15.100
Right. Nothing in here.

1:06:15.350 --> 1:06:16.435
No.

1:06:16.977 --> 1:06:19.479
Alright, well, I'll tell ya,
Lionel, it looks...

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:21.481
It's real nice.

1:06:21.565 --> 1:06:23.859
Why don't we draw up
some paperwork and, uh...

1:06:24.318 --> 1:06:25.194
Get it going.

1:06:25.277 --> 1:06:27.362
Sounds fine, mr James,
I think we got a deal.

1:06:54.473 --> 1:06:56.892
Well, if it isn't
the boy scouts of america.

1:06:57.559 --> 1:06:59.311
I heard what happened
to you guys.

1:07:00.312 --> 1:07:02.064
Roll down the window
for my partner.

1:07:02.481 --> 1:07:03.524
Partner?

1:07:05.943 --> 1:07:07.194
I apologise.

1:07:07.277 --> 1:07:09.821
I just assumed it was
"take your daddy to work" day.

1:07:09.905 --> 1:07:11.782
How you doin', skipper?

1:07:11.990 --> 1:07:12.990
Just fine.

1:07:14.576 --> 1:07:16.495
We know you did the va truck
with Wyatt.

1:07:16.578 --> 1:07:18.205
Alright, bodie, who told you that?

1:07:18.747 --> 1:07:19.748
Little birdie.

1:07:19.831 --> 1:07:20.831
Little birdie?

1:07:22.918 --> 1:07:25.212
Hey, your wife know you talk
to animals, bodie?

1:07:26.922 --> 1:07:28.048
Jay told us.

1:07:28.882 --> 1:07:29.925
Jay...

1:07:30.926 --> 1:07:32.928
Well, he's not with us
no more, is he?

1:07:33.929 --> 1:07:35.973
Yeah, well, before he jumped off

1:07:36.598 --> 1:07:39.351
he told us it was you
that killed his brother and the girl.

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:41.061
He said that?

1:07:41.687 --> 1:07:42.855
Son of a bitch.

1:07:43.856 --> 1:07:45.023
Word of a dead man.

1:07:45.649 --> 1:07:48.777
You guys are pathetic.
I'll tell you what, gramps

1:07:48.861 --> 1:07:51.905
why don't you hop in the back
and you gum me up real nice

1:07:51.989 --> 1:07:53.615
and I will confess to everything.

1:07:54.199 --> 1:07:57.035
Otherwise, get your
greasy fuckin' hands off my car.

1:07:59.955 --> 1:08:01.081
We'll be seeing you around.

1:08:01.290 --> 1:08:02.875
I look forward to it, bodie.

1:08:13.177 --> 1:08:15.554
- Someone in the office for ya.
- My office?

1:08:15.637 --> 1:08:16.721
- Yeah.
- Who?

1:08:16.889 --> 1:08:18.432
I don't know.
He wanted to wait inside.

1:08:23.687 --> 1:08:25.022
Excuse me, can I help you?

1:08:29.401 --> 1:08:30.569
Take a seat.

1:08:33.029 --> 1:08:35.365
You know, it didn't take
a lot of digging for me to

1:08:36.116 --> 1:08:38.368
find out everything
about this place.

1:08:40.453 --> 1:08:42.872
Or to find out everything
about you, for that matter.

1:08:44.041 --> 1:08:47.169
Your family is pretty
well documented.

1:08:50.339 --> 1:08:51.465
What do you want?

1:08:53.425 --> 1:08:55.260
It always amazes me

1:08:55.801 --> 1:08:59.805
the challenges that the lord
puts in front of us.

1:09:02.893 --> 1:09:04.937
I know your mama's
about to go, son.

1:09:06.229 --> 1:09:09.316
And I gather,
from the way that we met

1:09:10.108 --> 1:09:13.362
the last place you want her
drawing her final breath

1:09:13.654 --> 1:09:15.029
is in a cage.

1:09:17.616 --> 1:09:19.785
I've had a lot of time
to think about your, uh...

1:09:21.537 --> 1:09:23.080
Initial offer.

1:09:24.247 --> 1:09:27.334
And I'm going to
have to kindly decline.

1:09:27.542 --> 1:09:28.542
Is that so?

1:09:28.585 --> 1:09:29.752
I'm afraid so.

1:09:30.837 --> 1:09:31.921
Open your shirt.

1:09:43.767 --> 1:09:44.935
There. You happy?

1:09:54.862 --> 1:09:55.946
How much do you want?

1:09:59.992 --> 1:10:00.992
A million.

1:10:02.286 --> 1:10:03.287
No.

1:10:05.914 --> 1:10:08.125
Well, it's your mama,
you make me an offer.

1:10:08.750 --> 1:10:10.252
You know what, Stewart prince...

1:10:12.337 --> 1:10:14.965
You coming down here
doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.

1:10:19.094 --> 1:10:20.846
How do I know I can trust you?

1:10:23.307 --> 1:10:24.433
You can't.

1:10:25.475 --> 1:10:27.436
But I don't see
you got another choice.

1:10:32.733 --> 1:10:33.984
200,000.

1:10:34.985 --> 1:10:36.153
Right now.

1:10:37.404 --> 1:10:41.450
And I keep the hundred
I already got from you, like a deposit.

1:11:10.062 --> 1:11:11.355
Honey, can I come in?

1:11:17.361 --> 1:11:18.487
Hey.

1:11:20.864 --> 1:11:23.200
You've been in here
since last night. You ok?

1:11:26.703 --> 1:11:28.539
- Get you some food?
- I'm fine.

1:11:33.752 --> 1:11:34.753
Hon...

1:11:36.630 --> 1:11:37.673
Listen...

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:41.552
Shaina Davis's mum called me

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:44.555
she told me what happened.

1:11:48.767 --> 1:11:50.435
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1:11:54.189 --> 1:11:56.960
Why didn't you tell me? You know
you can talk to me about stuff like this.

1:11:56.984 --> 1:11:58.110
No, I can't.

1:11:59.152 --> 1:12:00.654
Course you can, I'm your mum.

1:12:03.282 --> 1:12:04.950
- Darla.
- No, you're not.

1:12:08.996 --> 1:12:10.247
What do you mean by that?

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:12.833
You're not my mum.

1:12:14.418 --> 1:12:15.627
I know.

1:12:18.422 --> 1:12:19.422
Who told you that?

1:12:19.923 --> 1:12:20.966
I met her.

1:12:21.592 --> 1:12:23.135
And when I met her, I just knew.

1:12:24.428 --> 1:12:26.722
You know, my whole life's
a fucking lie.

1:12:27.222 --> 1:12:29.850
You're a liar. You're not my mum,
you're my sister.

1:12:29.933 --> 1:12:31.810
Darla, just give me a chance.

1:12:32.186 --> 1:12:33.854
- Please. Darla, just wait...
- Fuck you!

1:12:36.690 --> 1:12:37.690
Fuck.

1:13:40.379 --> 1:13:41.713
What can we do for you, dally?

1:13:41.839 --> 1:13:46.176
Need a drop rig.
SUV, black, tinted, fully loaded.

1:13:46.677 --> 1:13:47.594
What's the job?

1:13:47.678 --> 1:13:49.721
Four to six,
maybe a couple military. Maybe.

1:13:50.097 --> 1:13:51.932
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

1:13:52.349 --> 1:13:53.559
What about a make-off?

1:13:58.689 --> 1:14:00.399
- This is downtown, Dallas.
- Yep.

1:14:00.732 --> 1:14:03.151
Well, if I get jammed up, man,
I can hit them tunnels.

1:14:03.318 --> 1:14:05.445
Right?
I need to have some options.

1:14:07.739 --> 1:14:08.739
Preference?

1:14:09.741 --> 1:14:12.744
Two band-aids in the business district,
one ghost on fifth.

1:14:15.539 --> 1:14:17.416
No problem.

1:14:17.749 --> 1:14:19.334
Extra 50k in there for you.

1:14:19.668 --> 1:14:20.752
Ok?

1:14:21.086 --> 1:14:22.754
Make sure those cars are there.

1:15:01.543 --> 1:15:04.087
Hey, hey, hey...
I'll do what you what.

1:15:04.796 --> 1:15:06.357
Doing what you want.
Doing what you want.

1:15:06.381 --> 1:15:07.758
Doing what you want, ok?

1:15:08.091 --> 1:15:09.091
Ok?

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:11.845
I'm gonna do whatever
you want me to do, ok?

1:15:15.265 --> 1:15:17.559
Doing what you want.
Doing what you want...

1:17:56.927 --> 1:17:58.303
Hey! Get up!

1:17:59.513 --> 1:18:00.931
Come on, let's go.

1:18:02.099 --> 1:18:04.518
- Where we goin?
- We're going to your ma's. Let's go.

1:18:05.394 --> 1:18:06.979
She's not my mum. I know.

1:18:07.688 --> 1:18:08.730
Oh, you know, huh?

1:18:08.814 --> 1:18:10.834
I don't want you to treat me like
I'm a little kid anymore.

1:18:10.858 --> 1:18:12.943
Oh, ok, fair enough.

1:18:13.777 --> 1:18:14.945
What the fuck is this?

1:18:15.028 --> 1:18:16.113
That's my piece.

1:18:16.280 --> 1:18:18.740
Your piece?
This is a fucking cop gun.

1:18:19.533 --> 1:18:21.702
I really hope you didn't do
anything stupid with this.

1:18:21.785 --> 1:18:24.830
Bodie taught me how to use it.
Please, please don't tell him.

1:18:30.586 --> 1:18:31.670
Let's go.

1:18:40.345 --> 1:18:41.471
Darla.

1:18:42.514 --> 1:18:43.514
Jeanie.

1:18:44.016 --> 1:18:45.016
Look.

1:18:49.104 --> 1:18:51.148
Do you know how bad
you've fucked her up?

1:18:51.523 --> 1:18:53.275
Look, mum is dying, jeanie.

1:18:53.775 --> 1:18:55.360
- She's dying.
- I don't care.

1:18:55.485 --> 1:18:58.405
She made a choice, it was selfish.
And when you're selfish, you die alone.

1:18:59.114 --> 1:19:00.199
No, jeanie.

1:19:00.282 --> 1:19:02.034
I'm done, Wyatt! Don't!

1:19:02.910 --> 1:19:03.911
You think...

1:19:04.161 --> 1:19:05.704
I know you think
that I'm stupid, Wyatt

1:19:05.787 --> 1:19:07.122
you think I'm a fuckin' idiot.

1:19:08.040 --> 1:19:09.917
Well, I play make believe
and naïve housewife

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:11.418
so that I can keep
my family intact.

1:19:11.710 --> 1:19:13.045
And I'm not a fuckin' idiot.

1:19:14.213 --> 1:19:15.839
I know what she turned you into.

1:19:16.173 --> 1:19:18.342
You think bodie doesn't tell me
what's going on?

1:19:18.425 --> 1:19:19.801
- Fuck bodie.
- No, fuck you!

1:19:21.762 --> 1:19:24.223
Don't you fucking dare
insult my husband.

1:19:24.723 --> 1:19:26.558
He is a good man
and I know you'd prefer

1:19:26.642 --> 1:19:27.893
that I was a widow

1:19:28.185 --> 1:19:30.395
or with some fuckin' ex-con
who beats the shit outta me

1:19:30.479 --> 1:19:33.148
cos that's the kind of guys
you approve of, right? Well, fuck you.

1:19:33.232 --> 1:19:34.942
Alright?
Cos I see that look in your eye

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:36.818
like you're up to something...

1:19:40.572 --> 1:19:41.740
Dad had that look.

1:19:43.033 --> 1:19:44.159
So you take your bullshit

1:19:44.243 --> 1:19:46.703
and you keep out of my
and my family's life, you hear me?

1:19:49.206 --> 1:19:50.624
Do you understand me, Wyatt?

1:19:57.798 --> 1:19:59.216
Get the fuck off my porch.

1:20:10.686 --> 1:20:12.020
Mrs Walker.

1:20:13.647 --> 1:20:14.815
Uh, I wonder if

1:20:15.399 --> 1:20:19.570
you had a statement that you would
like to make on your own behalf?

1:20:19.862 --> 1:20:22.531
Uh, I see here that...

1:20:23.949 --> 1:20:27.077
You've accomplished everything
expected of you while you've been here.

1:20:28.787 --> 1:20:29.830
Well...

1:20:30.747 --> 1:20:32.082
Mr chairman...

1:20:35.711 --> 1:20:38.172
The person you're talkin' to now

1:20:40.966 --> 1:20:42.342
it's two people, really.

1:20:44.011 --> 1:20:48.599
The person I was back when
those crimes were committed

1:20:51.518 --> 1:20:54.813
and the person I am today.

1:20:56.190 --> 1:20:58.775
The person I was back then

1:20:59.776 --> 1:21:02.404
because of situations
out of my control

1:21:03.822 --> 1:21:04.948
was selfish...

1:21:06.992 --> 1:21:09.995
And became full of darkness.

1:21:12.539 --> 1:21:15.167
As my counsel already mentioned.

1:21:17.711 --> 1:21:22.257
I paid what I considered
the ultimate price for my actions.

1:21:24.510 --> 1:21:26.553
The loss of the man
I loved most.

1:21:28.138 --> 1:21:29.181
My husband.

1:21:30.349 --> 1:21:31.433
James.

1:21:36.146 --> 1:21:38.398
He lost his life that night

1:21:39.274 --> 1:21:41.443
because of a plan I made, a...

1:21:43.946 --> 1:21:46.448
Mistake I made.

1:21:48.909 --> 1:21:50.494
That haunts me every day.

1:21:54.289 --> 1:21:56.166
Not only did I lose him

1:21:58.669 --> 1:22:01.797
but I lost the relationship
with my eldest daughter

1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:08.595
who rightfully has
held me accountable

1:22:09.429 --> 1:22:10.848
for my actions

1:22:12.724 --> 1:22:14.017
by removing me

1:22:15.018 --> 1:22:16.019
from her life.

1:22:18.730 --> 1:22:20.190
She has, however

1:22:22.442 --> 1:22:25.696
raised my youngest, Darla

1:22:27.739 --> 1:22:30.367
who I gave birth to
in this place

1:22:32.953 --> 1:22:34.079
as her own.

1:22:36.957 --> 1:22:41.003
A debt I will never
be able to repay.

1:22:46.175 --> 1:22:48.177
So you see, mr chairman

1:22:50.888 --> 1:22:52.222
the woman here

1:22:54.266 --> 1:22:56.059
doesn't have
much of anything left.

1:22:57.978 --> 1:22:59.188
She's empty.

1:23:02.357 --> 1:23:05.444
My... counsel is

1:23:05.986 --> 1:23:10.032
pleading for me to have some time
with the ones I love most, but...

1:23:12.743 --> 1:23:13.994
In reality

1:23:14.995 --> 1:23:17.748
the ones I love most
aren't with us anymore

1:23:19.708 --> 1:23:21.502
or want nothing to do with me.

1:23:26.632 --> 1:23:27.758
So I would...

1:23:28.342 --> 1:23:30.052
Just like an opportunity

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:33.680
to spend my time I have left

1:23:35.140 --> 1:23:36.266
with my son.

1:23:37.601 --> 1:23:38.810
He's all I have.

1:23:45.484 --> 1:23:46.484
Thank you.

1:23:47.194 --> 1:23:50.030
Mr drummond, ms Walker,
if you would kindly give us

1:23:50.113 --> 1:23:52.783
a minute to talk over
what we've heard here?

1:23:56.161 --> 1:23:57.412
It was great...

1:24:01.792 --> 1:24:03.877
Thank you, mrs Walker

1:24:04.503 --> 1:24:06.296
for the statement that you made.

1:24:07.422 --> 1:24:10.092
It's reassuring to this board

1:24:10.634 --> 1:24:14.096
to see the exemplary behaviour

1:24:14.179 --> 1:24:16.390
that you've exhibited
during this time.

1:24:17.099 --> 1:24:19.142
As well as the acknowledgment

1:24:19.226 --> 1:24:20.769
that you've made

1:24:21.144 --> 1:24:23.230
of the crimes
that you've committed.

1:24:23.897 --> 1:24:26.024
Not to mention the impact

1:24:26.525 --> 1:24:29.862
that that has had
on the personal relationships

1:24:30.737 --> 1:24:32.114
with the ones that you love.

1:24:34.616 --> 1:24:35.742
However...

1:24:37.119 --> 1:24:39.329
It is the view of this board
that parole

1:24:39.413 --> 1:24:41.331
is not to be granted.

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:45.169
I'm sorry, and I wish you
a peaceful passing.

1:24:45.669 --> 1:24:47.045
What did you just say?

1:24:47.629 --> 1:24:49.923
You... you owe this woman
an apology for that.

1:24:50.007 --> 1:24:52.176
Don't you get up. Don't you...
We're not done here!

1:24:52.259 --> 1:24:53.760
- That will be all.
- Sit back down.

1:24:53.844 --> 1:24:55.095
You're not done here!

1:24:55.179 --> 1:24:56.805
- You're not done here!
- Fuck.

1:24:56.889 --> 1:24:58.015
Get back here!

1:24:58.348 --> 1:24:59.516
You're dead!

1:25:00.517 --> 1:25:01.517
Dead!

1:25:01.602 --> 1:25:02.936
You're a dead man.

1:26:04.373 --> 1:26:05.415
Hey.

1:26:05.666 --> 1:26:08.226
Where the fuck have you been, man?
I've been calling you all day.

1:26:08.794 --> 1:26:09.878
Yeah, well...

1:26:12.297 --> 1:26:13.382
I just left her.

1:26:14.216 --> 1:26:15.509
Where... where d'ya leave her?

1:26:15.717 --> 1:26:17.970
W... where d'ya leave her?
What are you talking about?

1:26:19.096 --> 1:26:20.722
They denied her, son.

1:26:22.224 --> 1:26:23.350
What?

1:26:26.979 --> 1:26:28.105
I mean...

1:26:29.815 --> 1:26:33.735
Shit, that goddamn cruel son of a bitch
looked her in the eyes

1:26:34.695 --> 1:26:36.613
and told her
she could die in there.

1:26:42.786 --> 1:26:46.123
I'm so sorry, Wyatt.
I really am.

1:26:49.126 --> 1:26:51.295
She told me to tell you
that she loves you...

1:26:53.672 --> 1:26:56.133
And that you need to do
what you need to do.

1:26:57.467 --> 1:27:00.804
Get the hell out of
this godforsaken place.

1:27:01.054 --> 1:27:02.097
Forever.

1:27:02.472 --> 1:27:03.515
Fuck...

1:27:24.536 --> 1:27:26.896
If you wanna pull the plug
on this thing and forget about it

1:27:26.955 --> 1:27:27.956
I understand.

1:27:28.040 --> 1:27:30.918
No. I'm gonna fuckin' do it.

1:27:31.251 --> 1:27:33.462
If we get into something,
we lose them on the ground.

1:27:33.545 --> 1:27:35.589
If not, maybe take this tunnel.

1:27:38.091 --> 1:27:40.552
I ain't gonna let anything
fuckin' happen to you, ever.

1:27:41.803 --> 1:27:42.804
Ever.

1:28:03.367 --> 1:28:04.493
This it?

1:28:05.077 --> 1:28:06.286
Yeah. Strap up.

1:28:39.194 --> 1:28:40.794
Get down!
Get down on the fuckin' ground!

1:28:40.863 --> 1:28:42.155
Down! Down!

1:28:42.281 --> 1:28:43.699
Get down! Get the fuck down!

1:28:43.782 --> 1:28:45.075
Down! Down! Down!

1:28:48.287 --> 1:28:49.204
Hands, hands!

1:28:49.288 --> 1:28:50.890
Get your hands up there,
motherfucker! Up!

1:28:50.914 --> 1:28:52.708
Get up!
Don't do anything fuckin' stupid!

1:28:53.041 --> 1:28:54.459
Don't do anything stupid!

1:28:55.043 --> 1:28:56.086
Go, go.

1:28:56.837 --> 1:28:58.213
Hands, hands!

1:29:00.048 --> 1:29:01.048
Get out.

1:29:01.091 --> 1:29:02.091
Get out!

1:29:15.189 --> 1:29:17.107
- How many we got?
- That's it. Take those.

1:29:17.191 --> 1:29:18.233
I got the other two.

1:29:28.118 --> 1:29:29.745
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1:29:37.211 --> 1:29:39.880
You fuckin' hear. Look at me!
Look at me! Look at me!

1:29:40.756 --> 1:29:42.841
I don't give a shit! Here's my face.
Look at me.

1:29:43.008 --> 1:29:44.444
I'll shoot you
like a fuckin' animal.

1:29:44.468 --> 1:29:45.469
Wheels up, man.

1:29:47.346 --> 1:29:49.073
- Let's go, man.
- I don't give a shit, motherfucker.

1:29:49.097 --> 1:29:50.177
Put your fuckin' head down.

1:29:50.432 --> 1:29:51.642
- Let's go.
- Put it down!

1:29:52.976 --> 1:29:53.976
Pussy.

1:30:05.822 --> 1:30:06.865
This is Collier.

1:30:08.575 --> 1:30:09.618
You're shitting me.

1:30:10.536 --> 1:30:11.536
Where?

1:30:13.372 --> 1:30:14.456
I'm on my way.

1:30:20.045 --> 1:30:21.463
Jeanie, where's my gun?

1:30:47.865 --> 1:30:48.949
Fuck!

1:30:49.074 --> 1:30:51.034
<i>Dispatch, please alert all units.</i>

1:30:51.118 --> 1:30:52.995
<i>Suspects are heading downtown.</i>

1:30:53.078 --> 1:30:56.248
<i>Set a perimeter from 2nd, 4th
between Boulder and Detroit.</i>

1:30:59.001 --> 1:31:00.919
- I got one behind me, you see?
- Yeah.

1:31:07.885 --> 1:31:09.219
The fuck do we do now?

1:31:12.097 --> 1:31:13.140
The doors.

1:31:15.642 --> 1:31:16.643
Funny...

1:31:17.352 --> 1:31:20.522
They built those tunnels under the city
so oil men could move around unnoticed.

1:31:21.899 --> 1:31:23.025
Look at us now.

1:31:26.028 --> 1:31:27.714
There's one more make-off,
5th and Cheyenne.

1:31:27.738 --> 1:31:29.364
Anything happens to me,
you get there.

1:31:31.658 --> 1:31:32.659
Yeah.

1:31:35.245 --> 1:31:36.371
Let's go.

1:32:01.104 --> 1:32:02.105
Fuck!

1:32:03.190 --> 1:32:05.108
Get the fuck out! Get out!

1:32:58.829 --> 1:33:01.039
What do we do now?

1:33:01.582 --> 1:33:02.624
Fuck!

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:04.543
Fuck.

1:33:06.378 --> 1:33:08.005
I'm gonna spray
these motherfuckers.

1:33:08.172 --> 1:33:09.256
You get underground, ok?

1:33:09.590 --> 1:33:10.716
No fuckin' way, man!

1:33:11.216 --> 1:33:12.634
I got 'em covered. You go first.

1:33:15.554 --> 1:33:16.805
Ain't goin' nowhere, man.

1:33:18.515 --> 1:33:19.683
You go underground.

1:33:28.108 --> 1:33:29.776
Come on, motherfucker!

1:35:01.869 --> 1:35:03.287
Clear!

1:35:04.496 --> 1:35:07.749
- Clear!
- Stand back!

1:35:20.929 --> 1:35:22.347
Hold your fire! Clear!

1:37:10.289 --> 1:37:11.456
Wait! Wait!

1:37:11.582 --> 1:37:12.791
Wait. Wait, wait!

1:37:17.004 --> 1:37:18.463
Listen, she was gonna die anyway.

1:37:48.994 --> 1:37:50.078
Wyatt!

1:37:50.913 --> 1:37:51.997
Don't move.

1:37:57.669 --> 1:37:58.795
Don't move, Wyatt.

1:38:49.513 --> 1:38:51.265
- Yeah.
- How bad is it?

1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:54.977
Well, I'm certain
they would not call it "good".

1:38:55.352 --> 1:38:57.145
You got dead cops

1:38:58.105 --> 1:39:00.023
private security dead

1:39:01.358 --> 1:39:04.903
there's one attorney dead

1:39:04.987 --> 1:39:06.947
and then you even picked off
the meter maid.

1:39:07.656 --> 1:39:08.699
And Dallas?

1:39:10.742 --> 1:39:12.035
<i>He's gone, son.</i>

1:39:17.666 --> 1:39:18.834
<i>You there?</i>

1:39:19.543 --> 1:39:20.586
Yeah.

1:39:24.381 --> 1:39:25.716
Yeah. Listen, um...

1:39:27.926 --> 1:39:29.678
I think I know
how to get ma out.

1:39:32.306 --> 1:39:34.391
They're only gonna want
one thing.

1:39:34.933 --> 1:39:35.976
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1:39:37.519 --> 1:39:40.147
Yeah and even at that,
they probably like their odds.

1:39:42.316 --> 1:39:43.775
<i>Just get it done, ok?</i>

1:39:45.485 --> 1:39:46.485
<i>Oh, and Benny.</i>

1:39:47.279 --> 1:39:48.530
If you can, don't tell her.

1:39:49.865 --> 1:39:50.866
Ok?

1:39:53.076 --> 1:39:54.119
<i>You got it.</i>

1:39:54.453 --> 1:39:55.454
Alright.

1:40:44.169 --> 1:40:45.212
Hey, mama.

1:40:46.380 --> 1:40:48.298
Oh, you...

1:41:05.399 --> 1:41:06.525
I love you, ida.

1:41:09.736 --> 1:41:11.613
- I got it, I got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:41:22.416 --> 1:41:23.417
I got it.

1:41:29.548 --> 1:41:32.301
You know,
she held on just for this.

1:41:33.218 --> 1:41:36.138
You know that, don't you?
She's a hell of a woman, man.

1:41:36.221 --> 1:41:38.515
I'll never forget her.
She's a goddamn good...

1:41:38.682 --> 1:41:39.850
I know, Benny. I know.

1:41:40.517 --> 1:41:41.560
Yeah.

1:41:45.647 --> 1:41:47.524
I want you to keep 20%,
hold on to the rest.

1:41:47.608 --> 1:41:49.848
I'll let you know what to do with it
when the time comes.

1:41:59.119 --> 1:42:00.287
I'll see you real soon.

1:42:27.898 --> 1:42:29.233
Thank you, sweet boy.

1:42:32.528 --> 1:42:33.529
Alright, mama.

1:42:34.905 --> 1:42:35.948
Get some rest.

1:42:37.407 --> 1:42:38.534
Ok, baby.

1:43:46.226 --> 1:43:47.311
Mama?

1:43:48.729 --> 1:43:49.729
Mama?

1:44:05.495 --> 1:44:06.788
Your call, bodie.

1:44:09.082 --> 1:44:10.375
Just let him drive.

1:44:12.586 --> 1:44:14.213
He'll pull over when he's ready.

1:44:45.786 --> 1:44:47.371
Graduation's coming up.

1:44:48.830 --> 1:44:50.457
Wish you could be here for it.

1:44:54.127 --> 1:44:55.879
Don't really wanna go
to college.

1:44:59.216 --> 1:45:01.009
Don't really know
what I wanna do yet.

1:45:05.013 --> 1:45:06.390
I miss you, mum.

1:45:08.934 --> 1:45:10.644
Even though
I didn't really know you.

1:45:12.729 --> 1:45:13.939
I feel like I do.

1:45:33.125 --> 1:45:34.626
See you later, mum and dad.

1:45:36.545 --> 1:45:38.922
Dally, I'm taking real good care
of your car for you.

1:45:39.756 --> 1:45:40.841
You stay out of trouble.

1:46:40.192 --> 1:46:41.360
How you doin', kiddo?

1:46:41.652 --> 1:46:42.652
Good.

1:46:44.238 --> 1:46:45.447
I saw mum and dad today.

1:46:46.114 --> 1:46:47.115
Oh, yeah?

1:46:47.824 --> 1:46:48.825
Dally too.

1:46:49.868 --> 1:46:50.911
How they doin'?

1:46:52.037 --> 1:46:53.080
Good.

1:46:53.705 --> 1:46:54.957
Everyone misses you.

1:46:57.084 --> 1:46:58.126
I miss them too.

1:47:05.717 --> 1:47:06.969
You doin' alright out there?

1:47:09.137 --> 1:47:11.765
Yeah, just fine.
