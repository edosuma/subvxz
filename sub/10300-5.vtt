01:16.080 --> 01:17.399
Hear ye, hear ye.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.512
I am now officially opening
the weekly Bundy baby meeting...

01:20.720 --> 01:23.188
...which we all look forward to
so much.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.150
Dinner time!

01:30.040 --> 01:31.871
Just kidding.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.198
I love you, Peg.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.992
Just kidding.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.914
That was your Daddy.

01:41.120 --> 01:46.274
I know he doesn't sound like much,
but he brings in the big bucks.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.478
Now we shall begin
with the traditional salutation.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.191
- Hail, baby.
- Hail, baby.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.431
The baby is not fooled.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.710
- Hail, baby!
- Hail, baby!

02:01.240 --> 02:02.958
Good. Very good.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.110
The secretary can read the minutes
from our last baby meeting.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.234
You must forgive Kel, Mom.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.351
But she might just come to life
if you say:

02:14.560 --> 02:18.235
- "I just got paid and I wanna get..."
- That's enough.

02:21.680 --> 02:24.558
Now, Bud, I am promoting you
to temporary secretary.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.955
You may read your sister's minutes.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.436
I'm truly honoured.

02:31.240 --> 02:32.832
Hail, baby.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.598
"I can no longer write down...

02:36.800 --> 02:39.598
...the insane bellowing
of what used to be my mother.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.914
This baby is a curse to us all.

02:43.120 --> 02:46.271
Wait, I am supposed to rise
and give a 'Hail, baby.'

02:46.480 --> 02:48.072
There, I've done it.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.068
I feel cheaper than I've ever felt,
and that's saying something."

02:54.600 --> 02:58.229
Hail, baby.
I will now read the minutes.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.033
Hail, baby?

03:03.760 --> 03:07.435
You will say 10 "Hail, babys"
in the privacy of your own room.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.038
And now we will hear
from the treasurer.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.238
According to my research,
it takes $780,000...

03:23.440 --> 03:26.830
...to raise a baby
from birth through college.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.759
Thankfully, since I sold
a shoe last week...

03:30.880 --> 03:32.438
...I am proud to announce...

03:32.640 --> 03:36.952
...that we're now just short $780,000.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.873
Thank you very much.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.468
Hail, baby.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.717
You'll never guess where we went.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.435
To a store called the Sharper Infant.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.877
Everything
for the upwardly mobile baby.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.435
Their motto is:
"Don't believe the father...

03:59.640 --> 04:01.790
...you really can afford it."

04:02.920 --> 04:06.708
That's right.
Nothing's too good for your children.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.315
Well, I didn't mean you two.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.074
I will be so happy when this kid
is older than we are.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.748
Then maybe we'll get some attention.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.598
Al, we're gonna talk.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.872
So could you go sit next to Jefferson
or the dog or something?

04:26.640 --> 04:28.756
Hey, this is my house.
I sit where I want to.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.718
Look at the catalogue.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.079
Nursing bras. And they're sexy!

04:35.480 --> 04:36.799
I'm gonna sit over there now.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.396
Hey, Buck,
any room for me over there, boy?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.438
Please don't, I just ate.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.868
You should've seen this place.
Nothing but "pregnoids."

04:57.080 --> 04:59.753
It's been six months
since I've seen a woman with a waist.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.475
Yeah. Women are never sexier
than when they're pregnant.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.548
- You know what I'd do as president?
- What?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.876
I'd get me a big empty state
no one's using...

05:14.080 --> 05:16.389
...you know, a state like Idaho.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.599
Then I'd get every pregnant woman
in the country...

05:20.800 --> 05:23.917
...I'd stick them
into a doughnut truck...

05:24.120 --> 05:26.509
...and I'd convoy them to Boise.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.597
Since nobody cares
anything about Idaho...

05:28.800 --> 05:31.394
...I'd change the name to "Pregnaho."

05:34.680 --> 05:37.990
He must be talking about
his Idaho plan again.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.669
Oh, Marcie,
there's so many things I want.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.759
I mean, look at this baby bedroom
set. I've just gotta have this.

05:45.960 --> 05:48.349
Oh, Peggy, that's $10,000.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.471
Do you think Al can afford it?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.671
Well, what's it to me?

05:53.600 --> 05:55.272
- Let's go get one.
- Well, actually...

05:55.480 --> 05:57.550
...I'm not buying new furniture
for the baby.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.149
My daughter will inherit
all the precious heirlooms...

06:00.400 --> 06:01.674
...that were passed on to me.

06:01.880 --> 06:05.316
Including a beautiful baby desk
in hot pink with a ruffle.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.511
Well, what if your baby's a boy?

06:07.720 --> 06:10.188
Then let his father
get him something.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.473
Oh, my desk.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.750
I used to have this little tea service.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.635
And at my desk I would hold teas
for all my imaginary friends.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.230
There was Jennifer,
the most popular girl in the school.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.557
Well, she would never really
be my friend, but at my desk...

06:25.760 --> 06:29.036
...she'd drink four or five cups
of my tea. She'd have to.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.912
I'd make her.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.672
Then there was Robert,
the cutest guy in the school.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.953
Normally he'd just throw his milk
in my face, but not at my desk.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.755
Oh, I could see him now.
Kissing my 4-year-old feet.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.635
Lick them, baby.
Lick them, lick them like a dog.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.232
Oh, the times I would have
at my little desk...

06:50.440 --> 06:52.476
...with my little chair
and my little potty...

06:52.680 --> 06:56.275
...where I'd shove
imaginary Jennifer's face every day.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.198
Yeah, new stuff is fine...

06:58.400 --> 07:02.234
...but how can you put a price tag
on memories like those?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.955
Well, I see since your pregnancy...

07:08.160 --> 07:11.755
...you've stopped taking
your little pills, haven't you?

07:12.680 --> 07:15.956
- So now we got Pregnaho.
- Yeah.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.958
And we got "PMSachusetts."

07:23.200 --> 07:27.990
But where we live
is called "Breast Virginia."

07:34.280 --> 07:36.316
That's mean, Al.

07:39.680 --> 07:44.071
She's got you shaking
like a Frenchman in a thunderstorm.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.714
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well, last month I
stopped paying for her storage unit...

07:48.920 --> 07:50.672
...took the money and went
to the track.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.916
Does that sound like a man
afraid of his wife?

07:53.160 --> 07:55.799
Jefferson, can I have the keys
to the storage unit?

07:56.360 --> 07:58.635
Watch me con my way
out of this one.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.589
What storage unit?

08:03.160 --> 08:07.756
The storage unit where I keep my
precious, irreplaceable baby furniture.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.673
Good night, sweet prince.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.116
Can I have the keys?
I want to show Peggy.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.915
I love you so very deeply.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.716
What have you done
to my baby furniture...

08:22.920 --> 08:26.037
...which means more to me
than five of you?

08:30.720 --> 08:33.553
And you didn't want them
to come over.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.751
I was wrong.

08:39.039 --> 08:43.635
You let them auction off my baby
furniture? My memories? My life?

08:44.039 --> 08:47.999
And there's the windup
and the pitch.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.671
That's out of the park.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.353
Now.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.275
I am going to go
and get my furniture back.

09:01.520 --> 09:05.911
I want you to remain on the floor
and think about what you've done.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.350
Peggy and I are gonna go
to the storage company...

09:08.560 --> 09:10.915
...and get a list of people
who bought my heirlooms.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.598
- Well, why me?
- Because when I get back...

09:14.800 --> 09:18.236
...I want to strip him
of every ounce of human dignity.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.954
And only you can teach me how.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.000
Yeah, she's the best.
She debased me.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.795
You're making me blush.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.479
You know, it's true. When we
were married, he was so cute.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.708
He demanded three meals a day,
clean clothes, and pillows.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.673
It took me three long days.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.553
But, baby, look at him now.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.117
You can get up now, Jefferson.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.550
She told me not to.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.991
Hear ye, hear ye.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.159
I call the third weekly Bundy
anti-baby meeting to order.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.269
If we may begin,
we should don our ceremonial hats.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.829
Set sail, baby.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.078
Now we may begin.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.477
The secretary may read the minutes
from our last meeting.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.716
"After feeding Mom
into a doughnut coma...

10:42.800 --> 10:46.190
...and setting pudding traps,
should she awaken...

10:47.080 --> 10:50.516
...we officially booed the baby
and began the meeting.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.517
Dad, my Daddy...

10:52.720 --> 10:57.236
...once again wept with shame
at his involvement in the pregnancy."

10:58.360 --> 11:00.920
I tell you,
I didn't know what hit me.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.993
"And then Daddy said,
'I tell you, I didn't know what hit me.'

11:07.840 --> 11:12.391
Bud, my brother, recited from
the Bible, quoting the story of Moses.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.670
He suggested we place the baby
in a basket...

11:14.880 --> 11:17.599
...with a couple of quarters
and a blanket...

11:18.320 --> 11:22.598
...and float it down the Ohio River,
verily, to Cleveland."

11:24.920 --> 11:28.151
Set sail, baby.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.995
"Then we had a two-to-one vote
to replace our Mom...

11:35.200 --> 11:38.078
...with a huge-hootered
Oriental woman...

11:41.600 --> 11:45.195
...who had no vocal chords,
no uterus...

11:45.400 --> 11:48.358
...but can fry a steak like a Texan.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.636
Then Mommy woke up and wanted
to know what we were laughing at.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.671
We said, 'Bud.'

11:59.040 --> 12:01.156
He trolled up the stairs
in a little huff...

12:01.360 --> 12:03.999
...and the three of us
laughed at him until dawn.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.270
That was the beginning
of our anti-Bud meeting."

12:07.520 --> 12:10.398
- Hey.
- Now, now, Bud. Hold on.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.750
She's only kidding you.
Only kidding.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.990
Sit down. What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how he feels?

12:23.280 --> 12:26.955
All right, now,
let's get on with the new business.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.670
Has anyone come up with a new name
for the baby?

12:29.920 --> 12:32.275
Shark Bait.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.397
Hemlock.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.916
Piscopo.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.390
- That's a low blow.
- Dad, that's really mean.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.870
I'd like some water.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.718
Why don't you get it yourself?

12:44.960 --> 12:46.837
Marcie told me not to move.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.839
Now, kids, I want you to take
a good look over there...

12:51.040 --> 12:53.395
...and you tell me
what that teaches you.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.357
- Nothing.
- No.

12:56.600 --> 13:01.390
It is that this is the thing can happen
if you let pregnasaurs rule the earth.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.670
Now, we've got one
in our very home.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.589
Are we going to let our own great
red pregzilla do this to us?

13:09.400 --> 13:10.799
No.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.677
Are they going to find us
with our legs up in the air?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.390
Well, I can't speak for Kelly,
but they won't find me like that.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.108
Yeah, right.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.276
Like I've never seen you
like that before...

13:32.480 --> 13:35.790
...whenever Pebbles Flintstone wears
a leopard mini-dress.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.554
Now, now, hold it, now!

13:39.760 --> 13:42.320
Now, kids, we're not out here
to attack each other.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.159
We're here to attack the baby.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.316
- All right, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.831
Look, it's my blanket.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.598
Mr. Edwin Johansson?

14:00.800 --> 14:02.028
Indeed.

14:02.240 --> 14:05.232
Sir, I understand that you recently
attended an auction...

14:05.440 --> 14:07.590
...where you purchased
my old baby blanket...

14:07.800 --> 14:09.836
...which was knitted
by my Gamma Judy.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.712
Which I used to comfort myself...

14:11.920 --> 14:14.992
...and to suffocate
my imaginary friend Jennifer.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.636
I can see that it means
a great deal to you...

14:17.840 --> 14:22.960
...by the way that it houses your
collection of broken glass and mucous.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.475
But I must have it back at any price.

14:25.720 --> 14:26.948
A hundred grand.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.630
How about a chop
to the Adam's apple?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.070
Easy, Marcie.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.633
Let me handle this.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.671
Now look, Al.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.070
I mean, Edwin.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.437
I wonder how I could've
made a mistake like that.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.836
I have here a gift certificate
for a free pair of women's shoes.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.237
I dared to dream it
and now it comes true.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.395
Peggy, I feel guilty. I can't have you
spend your coupons on me.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.876
Oh, Marcie. Don't worry about it.
I've got thousands of these.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.356
I steal them out of the cash register
when Al's not looking.

15:07.160 --> 15:08.639
So, what do you say, Edwin?

15:08.880 --> 15:11.713
Make it five $500 worth of shoes
and we've got a deal.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.598
Five hundred dollars?

15:13.800 --> 15:17.190
Oh, Marcie, I give away
more than that at Halloween.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.595
Kids just love them.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.279
Give me this blanket.

15:28.440 --> 15:29.668
Tell me, sir...

15:29.880 --> 15:33.031
...how has society
turned its back on you?

15:33.240 --> 15:36.073
The plant close down?
The farm went under? What?

15:36.280 --> 15:37.952
Can I help you get a job?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.590
I already have a job. School teacher.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.196
Demand 340.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.429
- And what else do we want?
- Love and affection.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.513
No. We said it had to be
something we all wanted.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.313
I know, how about clean clothes?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.788
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.150
Where does it say
because a woman is pregnant...

16:08.360 --> 16:10.316
...she can't take 18 years
worth of socks...

16:10.520 --> 16:12.511
...dump them in a machine
and push a button?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.472
We're being had, I tell you.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.950
And who says she can't get
the wasps off the roof?

16:17.200 --> 16:21.432
Right. If there were pies up there, you'd
have to get a gun and shoot her down.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.592
I want clean, dry sheets.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.312
Well, you know,
because it gets humid in my room.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.793
Yes, dancing with a rubber woman
can make any room a jungle.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.314
Look at him. He's probably thinking
up ways to make it up to Marcie.

16:54.520 --> 16:57.159
Yeah. It is kind of sweet
when you think about it.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.432
Play it again, Magic Balladeer.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.318
- I'm Topsy.
- I'm Mopsy.

17:26.520 --> 17:30.672
- We're twins. We're your biggest fans.
- We're twins. We're your biggest fans.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.878
What a crummy fantasy.

17:35.080 --> 17:39.312
Yeah, I know, but my wife's mad at me.
It's hard to concentrate.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.710
Hey, here's a little something I know
you girls have been wanting to ask me.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.794
Do you wanna dance

17:48.320 --> 17:51.073
Under the moonlight?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.549
I know. I know.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.751
He must be in great pain.

18:07.240 --> 18:08.878
Okay, so we're agreed.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.231
We show this list to your mother
and we hold firm to our demands.

18:12.440 --> 18:16.274
Rights of the born.
Can I get a "Whoa, born"?

18:16.480 --> 18:18.550
Whoa, born!

18:21.440 --> 18:26.560
Oh, I think you know what you
have to do for backstage passes.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.317
I can't stand to see him
torturing himself like this.

18:32.800 --> 18:34.791
Let's throw him out in the street.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.558
- Mrs. Garcia?
- Yes.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.115
You'll be glad to know that this
is the last stop...

18:42.320 --> 18:46.916
...on an arduous journey to recover
the lost furniture of my childhood.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.077
What?

18:49.320 --> 18:51.595
My desk. My little desk.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.030
Do you mind?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.958
While my friend is paddling
down the river of insanity...

19:02.160 --> 19:03.479
...perhaps we could talk.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.435
Chicken. May I?

19:07.640 --> 19:11.713
Oh, please do.
We keep it out for intruders.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.875
Anyway, it's about this desk.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.789
You see, my friend would really like
to buy it. It means a lot to her.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.589
And over here is where
imaginary Jennifer would sit.

19:23.800 --> 19:27.270
I bet she'd like some nice,
scalding tea in her face.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.119
- What do you think, Jorge?
- Mom.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.668
Anyway, we don't have any money.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.316
But we have a $1000 worth
of shoe coupons.

19:38.520 --> 19:43.275
You see, in this country
my husband is a very powerful man.

19:43.480 --> 19:45.357
He's a shoe salesman.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.874
Really?

19:47.080 --> 19:52.313
In my country, shoe salesmen are
laughed at by beggars and the feeble.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.912
Our countries are very much alike.
Do we have a deal?

19:59.160 --> 20:04.075
Well, I am very touched by your offer
and by your friend's insanity...

20:04.960 --> 20:09.078
...but to my family,
this desk is a symbol of America.

20:09.280 --> 20:12.477
It is the very first thing
that we bought in this country.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.389
And we wanted to pass it down
to generation and generation...

20:16.600 --> 20:20.718
...in our family as a symbol
of hope and freedom.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.630
For, although we are not Americans,
our children can be.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.551
All that highfalutin
talk about hope and freedom...

20:34.760 --> 20:38.196
...sure didn't last through
the threat of calling Immigration.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.194
You're a mighty sick woman, Marcie.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.188
Well, maybe so, maybe so.
But I'm a sick woman with a desk.

20:51.520 --> 20:52.839
Where's Jefferson?

20:53.080 --> 20:55.674
He's out in the backyard
singing "Tiny Bubbles" to Buck...

20:55.880 --> 20:59.236
...but that's not important.

21:00.160 --> 21:02.958
Me and the kids
have something to say to you...

21:03.160 --> 21:06.072
...and all pregnoids like you.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.719
Tell them, kids.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.672
What?

21:13.840 --> 21:16.195
- We love you, Mommy.
- We love you, Mommy.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.073
You should've heard the things Dad
was saying about you and the baby.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.475
Yeah. He was gonna make you
do the laundry.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.955
Yeah. He made us wear these hats.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.594
That's untrue. That's untrue.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.877
Well, I handled my husband.
What are you gonna do?

21:51.240 --> 21:54.676
Al, what are you doing
in my fantasy?

21:56.040 --> 22:00.750
I don't know. Last thing I remember
a frying pan bounced off my head.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.913
But don't mind me...

22:03.120 --> 22:05.156
...I'm on my way to my own fantasy.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.753
Girls...

22:09.360 --> 22:12.113
...there's a Porsche in my fantasy.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.192
Hey.
