01:28.714 --> 01:30.799
You must be Jean.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.801
I'm Louis. Please, come in.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.684
I was... expecting somewhere

01:40.767 --> 01:43.312
a bit more... grand.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.607
It's our policy
to engage with the client
at their level.

01:48.692 --> 01:51.570
You thought I'd be more
comfortable in a shitty motel

01:51.653 --> 01:52.779
than a chateau?

01:52.863 --> 01:54.781
Why don't you have a seat?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.828
Took a lot of work
to track you down.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.831
Well, we're happy
to have a high bar
of entry.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.876
Any potential client
we want to make sure
is completely committed.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.920
Oh, I'm‐‐ I'm committed.

02:09.004 --> 02:12.507
When I hear the Black Sabbath
album for the first time,
it changed my life.

02:12.591 --> 02:13.884
Black Sabbath?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.762
You've never heard
of Black Sabbath?

02:16.845 --> 02:18.597
They're this awesome rock band
out of Britain.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.932
I thought you'd be
all over that shit.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.269
Oh, well, I don't really listen
to much contemporary music.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.606
Right,
because you've got, like,

02:27.689 --> 02:29.775
the whole back catalogue
to choose from.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.401
( chuckles )

02:31.485 --> 02:34.780
I bet a lot
of the best musicians
probably end up...

02:34.863 --> 02:36.823
i‐‐ in your place.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.784
I'm not at liberty
to discuss other clients.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.369
Sure.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.914
But...

02:43.997 --> 02:45.749
Robert Johnson?

02:45.832 --> 02:47.959
Keith Richards?
Jimi Hendrix?

02:48.043 --> 02:50.379
They're not gonna go up there,
are they?

02:50.462 --> 02:51.671
Jean, why don't you
have a seat

02:51.755 --> 02:53.924
<i>and tell me</i>
<i>exactly what it is</i>

02:54.007 --> 02:56.385
you want
from this arrangement.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.767
Everyone else
is partying all the time.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.853
Sex, drugs and rock and roll.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.483
All the dumb bitches

03:11.566 --> 03:13.819
with their cars
and their boyfriends

03:13.902 --> 03:17.239
and their apartments
and their... hairdos.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.619
If they've got all that,
why shouldn't I?

03:22.702 --> 03:24.621
<i>Why shouldn't I...</i>

03:24.704 --> 03:26.998
fuck all the hot guys

03:27.082 --> 03:30.335
and live in a huge house
and drive a cool car

03:30.419 --> 03:33.004
and look great all the time?

03:33.088 --> 03:35.006
I want to do that.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.468
And I want to tell
all the dumb‐asses
who ever got in my way

03:38.552 --> 03:42.013
or told me no
or said I was ugly
or fat or square

03:42.097 --> 03:43.890
that they can rot in hell.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.689
I guess that last part
is kind of your call,
but you know what I mean.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.316
Yes, I think I do.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.698
You're not exactly giving this
the hard sell.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.284
Not really trying
to close the deal.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.661
That's not the way
we do things.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.705
It's very important to me

04:06.788 --> 04:09.708
that this be
one hundred percent
your decision.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.669
So how does it work exactly?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.921
Well, once you've
made your choice

04:15.005 --> 04:16.840
and you're comfortable
with it,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.384
I have you
sign some papers,

04:19.468 --> 04:22.345
and once I have
your signature,

04:22.429 --> 04:23.638
the transaction
is complete.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.683
Do I have to sign in blood?

04:26.767 --> 04:27.893
Ink will be fine.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.019
Oh.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.694
Uhh‐‐ You might want
to read it through first.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.905
OK, Dad.

04:39.988 --> 04:43.408
At‐At least
take a look at the‐‐
at the last section there.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.660
Item 6.1?

04:45.744 --> 04:46.661
( sighs )

04:49.623 --> 04:52.584
"Service provider
shall retain ownership
of the client's soul

04:52.667 --> 04:55.796
for a duration which shall
have a floor of eternity

04:55.879 --> 04:58.507
and a ceiling of... eternity."

05:00.467 --> 05:03.553
And are you <i>completely</i>
comfortable with that?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.388
Yeah.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.598
Yeah, it's cool.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.768
Uh, just forgive
my asking, but...

05:09.851 --> 05:13.396
what are your reasons
for believing it's "cool"?

05:13.480 --> 05:15.398
Well, I don't really
believe in a soul.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.818
<i>Or any of that shit.</i>

05:17.901 --> 05:20.695
It's Christian dogma,
I'm not into that.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.990
Well, I would say that, um,

05:24.074 --> 05:27.619
a substantial part
of our whole setup...

05:27.702 --> 05:30.455
‐ is Christian dogma.
‐ Whatever.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.084
You believe what you believe,
I'll believe what I believe.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.877
Let's just agree to disagree.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.548
Ju‐‐ Ju‐‐ Just so we're

05:39.631 --> 05:44.052
crystal clear on this, uh...

05:44.135 --> 05:47.639
ownership of the soul
for eternity,

05:47.722 --> 05:52.477
typically, that duration
of ownership...

05:52.561 --> 05:54.729
would take place
in the underworld.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.359
Specifically, hell.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.155
( laughing )

06:04.239 --> 06:07.742
Souls? Hell?

06:07.826 --> 06:10.161
You're really crackin' me up
over here.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.705
OK.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.042
Bring it on.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.504
Fill me up
with the cash and the drugs
and the big, hard dicks!

06:19.588 --> 06:20.755
Let's do this!

06:29.264 --> 06:30.974

06:37.105 --> 06:38.481

<i>‐ ( knocking on door )</i>
<i>‐ ( turns music off )</i>

07:00.712 --> 07:03.548
Jean. It's been a long time.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.216
( laughs )

07:05.300 --> 07:08.553
Same shitty motel room.

07:08.637 --> 07:11.222
‐ Louis: So tell me,
how have you been?
‐ Great.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.808
Yeah, really great,
as a matter of fact.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.560
I'm pleased to hear it.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.897
People are so snobby
about worldly pleasures.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.567
Sex, food, drink, drugs,

07:22.651 --> 07:25.570
sports cars, mansions, yachts,

07:25.654 --> 07:30.116
helicopters, jewelry,
designer clothes, sex.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.535
‐ Did I mention sex?
‐ Yes.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.621
( both chuckle )

07:34.704 --> 07:38.083
May I offer you a drink?
I have an excellent single malt.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.044
Leonard, it's great
to see you again.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.755
‐ It's Louis.
‐ But I was just wondering

07:43.838 --> 07:45.799
how long this was
going to take.

07:45.882 --> 07:51.596
See, I have a private jet
to St. Barts on standby.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.016
Ah. Well, I'm afraid to say

07:55.100 --> 07:57.143
I don't think you're going
to make that flight.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.688
What are you talking about?

07:59.771 --> 08:01.606
Well, Jean, today is‐‐

08:01.690 --> 08:04.776
how can I put this
without sounding clichéd?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.278
The day of reckoning.

08:07.362 --> 08:11.282
‐ The what?
‐ Item 6.1.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.869
Per our agreement,
the company owns your soul.

08:14.953 --> 08:18.707
And today's the day we...
cash it in, so to speak.

08:18.790 --> 08:21.960
Let me put this
as simply as possible.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.295
You won't be going
to St. Barts tonight.

08:24.379 --> 08:28.008
Instead, you'll be
going to hell...

08:28.091 --> 08:29.843
for eternity.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.803
You're not serious.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.180
I'm completely serious.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.142
Well, I'll have
my lawyer look through this.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.144
I don't know why
this is such a surprise.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.979
You'll recall that
before you signed

08:41.062 --> 08:43.106
I did direct you
to the appropriate clauses,

08:43.189 --> 08:44.274
the terms and conditions.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.151
Terms and conditions.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.987
Who reads the goddamn
terms and conditions?

08:49.070 --> 08:51.740
I don't know,
people who are signing away
their immortal souls?

08:51.823 --> 08:54.868
But when I signed this,
I didn't even have a lawyer.

08:54.951 --> 08:57.954
This is not worth
the paper it's printed on.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.582
Hey. We kept our side
of the bargain.

09:00.665 --> 09:03.668
You had 50 great years.
You said so yourself.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.754
Now it's time
to pay the check.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.630
Nobody likes paying the check,

09:07.714 --> 09:10.175
but unfortunately,
the check must be paid.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.928
And the payment is...
eternity in hell.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.348
I don't think so.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.894
I get this every time.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.605
Every damn time.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.273
Is it so much to ask

09:25.356 --> 09:27.358
for someone to actually
read the words

09:27.442 --> 09:29.736
that are written in a contract
before they sign it?

09:29.819 --> 09:32.822
Apparently, it's the most
difficult thing in the world
for you people!

09:35.283 --> 09:36.701
Look on the bright side.

09:36.785 --> 09:40.205
You'll have lots and lots
of happy memories

09:40.288 --> 09:42.332
to look back on forever!

09:42.415 --> 09:44.793
And when you talk
about hell,

09:44.876 --> 09:46.044
what do you mean, exactly?

09:46.127 --> 09:48.922
Hell. The famous hell?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.633
You've seen it
in the paintings,
the movies?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.719
Is this that
ironic version of hell?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.638
Like Homer Simpson
and the donuts?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.181
Homer Simpson‐‐

09:58.264 --> 10:01.309
No! There's no <i>donuts.</i>
It's not ironic.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.645
There's no irony down there.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.856
This is never‐ending torment!

10:06.940 --> 10:09.692
With fire! Lots of fire!

10:09.776 --> 10:11.861
They love fire!
They can't get enough of it!

10:11.945 --> 10:14.072
Hell, though, really?
<i>Hell?</i>

10:14.155 --> 10:17.158
I mean, with the flames
and the naked bodies

10:17.242 --> 10:19.744
and the little red guys
with pointy tails?

10:19.828 --> 10:22.038
That's pretty much
the size of it, yes.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.332
And heaven
is full of clouds?

10:24.415 --> 10:28.002
And angels with halos
playing harps?

10:28.086 --> 10:31.047
I've never been myself,
but from what I understand,

10:31.131 --> 10:32.340
that's pretty much it.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.676
Well, I'm not buying it.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.389
Would you like
to see a preview?

10:39.472 --> 10:40.348
A preview?

10:46.229 --> 10:50.233
‐ <i>( hissing, demonic music )</i>
‐ Oh, Jesus!

10:50.316 --> 10:53.278
‐ <i>( voices screaming )</i>
‐ Jesus fucking Christ!

10:53.361 --> 10:55.738
<i>( screams continue )</i>

10:59.868 --> 11:01.494
( vomiting )

11:01.578 --> 11:04.414
Ohh. Ohh. Ohh.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.291
So as I was saying‐‐

11:06.374 --> 11:08.126
I didn't realize!

11:08.209 --> 11:10.253
I‐I didn't realize!

11:10.336 --> 11:13.298
Yeah, I'd like to say that
you get used to it eventually,

11:13.381 --> 11:15.842
but I don't think
you really ever do.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.261
And that happens
for eternity?

11:18.344 --> 11:21.222
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ Oh, my God.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.017
Jean...

11:24.100 --> 11:27.020
I know this may look harsh
or unfair,

11:27.103 --> 11:30.982
but remember, everyone's
down there for a reason.

11:31.065 --> 11:34.485
Either they sold their souls
for earthly pleasures
like you did,

11:34.569 --> 11:38.990
or they were just...
major league assholes.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.242
Well, this is
not gonna happen.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.952
Jean, it's what
always happens.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
Well, not with me.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.417
George, it's Jean.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.171
I have this contra‐‐ Hey!

11:53.254 --> 11:56.257
I've watched a thousand lawyers
read a thousand contracts

11:56.341 --> 11:58.259
in a thousand
different languages,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.220
many of which
have since died out.

12:00.303 --> 12:03.973
There's no loophole.
You sold your soul.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.143
And you're going to hell.
Forever.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.811
The end.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.408
Look, Jean, you had
50 great years.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.995
Some people don't get
50 great minutes!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.539
‐ ( sighs )
‐ What are you sighing about?

12:28.623 --> 12:31.542
I'm the one
that's going to hell.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.419
Do you know
how depressing it is

12:33.503 --> 12:36.339
to send people
to ceaseless torment

12:36.422 --> 12:38.049
on a regular basis?

12:38.132 --> 12:39.217
It's a real bummer.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.220
Ohh. I'm so sorry.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.555
Are you getting blisters
on your hands

12:44.639 --> 12:46.307
from all
the pitchfork‐wielding?

12:46.391 --> 12:49.185
‐ Poor you.
‐ Yeah. You asked for it.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.354
You literally
signed up for it.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.482
But you're all stupid,
mostly.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.234
You regret it at the end,

12:56.317 --> 12:57.944
and then you come back
with cirrhosis of the liver

12:58.027 --> 12:59.904
and a trail
of broken relationships.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.406
I don't have either.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.283
And I've had a really,
really good time.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.829
I must say it took me a while
to get used to it,

13:07.912 --> 13:09.998
but once I got into
the swing of it,

13:10.081 --> 13:12.250
I must say I loved it.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.420
Being a hard‐headed,
hedonistic asshole

13:15.503 --> 13:18.256
really worked for me.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.216
Well, I'm certainly glad
you made the most of it.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.343
There was a turning point,

13:22.427 --> 13:26.097
a moment when things
really became clear to me.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.267
I was fucking this guy,
and fucking with his head,

13:29.350 --> 13:32.270
he was crying and begging,

13:32.353 --> 13:35.356
and I realized
that I had a choice.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.443
I could be sympathetic,
or I could just not give a shit,

13:38.526 --> 13:42.447
turn my compassion off
like a light switch.

13:42.530 --> 13:46.159
And I chose option two.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.495
So I went on fucking him
and fucking with him

13:49.579 --> 13:52.498
until I got bored,
and then I tossed him away.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.210
I never turned that switch
back on.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.379
And I did some terrible things.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.465
That was just the beginning.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.593
I did awful things.
Really bad. Terrible.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.387
Really evil.

14:06.471 --> 14:10.016
( chuckles ) Oh, boy.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.101
( laughs )

14:12.185 --> 14:14.896
I thought you'd
be interested in this,

14:14.979 --> 14:17.148
being the devil and everything.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.233
I'm not the devil,
I just work for the devil.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.319
‐ Oh, so you're a demon?
‐ What?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.571
No! I'm not a demon!
Fuck those assholes!

14:25.406 --> 14:29.368
I'm more of an executive
assistant to the devil.

14:29.452 --> 14:32.955
‐ Cool.
‐ Yeah, it was cool...

14:33.039 --> 14:35.166
at first.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.001
But a few millennia on,

14:37.085 --> 14:42.048
and I'm really just
so tired of the whole thing,

14:42.131 --> 14:44.050
if I'm honest.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.302
I thought I was
cut out for this,

14:46.385 --> 14:49.639
but I have bad dreams.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.017
Horrible dreams.
Every night.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.978
All this damnation,
it doesn't...

14:56.062 --> 14:59.065
sit well with me.

14:59.148 --> 15:01.275
My digestion
is shot to fuck.

15:03.152 --> 15:06.030
( sighs ) I just
don't know how much longer

15:06.114 --> 15:08.449
I can keep doing this.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.245
Well, if sending people to hell
is making you feel so bad,

15:12.328 --> 15:14.122
I have a suggestion.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.707
‐ Stop. Just say no.
‐ Take my word for it.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.627
Eternal damnation
would be a day at the beach

15:19.710 --> 15:22.213
compared to what
he would do to me
if I walked out.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.714
Well...

15:23.798 --> 15:27.718
you know,
maybe there's an answer‐‐
for both of us.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.096
What?

15:30.179 --> 15:32.723
Well, how about
if I took over?

15:32.807 --> 15:34.392
Took over?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.561
I could take over
your job as demon...

15:36.644 --> 15:39.480
‐ I'm not a demon.
‐ ...and then you could retire

15:39.564 --> 15:41.983
and take up waterskiing
or whatever.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.193
Think about it.
It's a win‐win.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.363
I mean, you wouldn't be
crucified for leaving your post,

15:47.446 --> 15:50.741
and I would avoid
an eternity of torment.

15:50.825 --> 15:54.537
Maybe...
it's a possibility.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.375
You would be
directly involved

15:59.458 --> 16:01.294
in a vast amount
of suffering.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.671
I'm not sure any human being
could deal with that.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.424
Well, I'm not
your average human being.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.135
I've been in training for this
my whole life.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.763
And I feel so connected
to your brand‐‐
the whole evil thing.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.557
I mean, it's really me.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.059
OK, I get that you're
a sociopathic narcissist.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.603
But for something
like this,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
you'd really need
to crank it up

16:20.313 --> 16:22.106
‐ to the next level.
‐ Bring it on.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.774
Because if you
take the job

16:23.858 --> 16:25.443
and <i>then</i> decide
you can't handle it,

16:25.526 --> 16:28.446
that would rebound
very badly on <i>me.</i>

16:28.529 --> 16:31.365
How about
you let me prove myself?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.408
How do you mean?

16:32.491 --> 16:35.453
Dustin! Dustin?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.747
<i>( door opens )</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:39.665
I just got off the phone
with the air strip

16:39.749 --> 16:42.126
‐ and the pilots on standby‐‐
‐ No. Don't worry about that.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.336
‐ Jean: <i>Come on in.</i>
‐ <i>( door closes )</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:45.713
This is Louis.
Louis, Dustin.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.132
Hi there.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.301
Would you like a drink?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.303
‐ Oh, no, I'm‐‐
‐ Louis and I

16:52.386 --> 16:56.474
have been discussing
a very interesting
career opportunity.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.476
‐ For me.
‐ OK.

16:58.559 --> 17:02.188
I know how
supportive you've been
to me in my career,

17:02.271 --> 17:06.484
and I know that you would
want me to pursue any
opportunities that came my way.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.320
Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to help
in any way that I can.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.280
Wonderful.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.658
Louis and I want
to give you an opportunity

17:13.741 --> 17:15.618
to experience something

17:15.701 --> 17:19.163
that millions have argued about
for millennia.

17:19.247 --> 17:23.501
Think of it as a reward
for your years of service.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.211
Now finish your drink,

17:25.294 --> 17:28.589
and I'm going to start you
on your fantastic voyage.

17:31.676 --> 17:35.888
<i>In a moment I'm going to ask</i>
<i>you to open the bathroom door.</i>

17:35.972 --> 17:39.517
And when you do,
you will be amazed
at what you see.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.811
<i>Amazed and astonished.</i>

17:41.894 --> 17:45.189
But first I just want
to tell you how pleased I am

17:45.273 --> 17:47.817
to have been working with you
over the last two years.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.444
‐ It's been five, actually‐‐
‐ And I just want to thank you

17:50.528 --> 17:52.655
for your patience
and your forbearance.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.739
OK.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.202
<i>( hissing, screaming )</i>

17:58.286 --> 17:59.537
Oh!

17:59.620 --> 18:01.163
Dustin:
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

18:06.711 --> 18:08.588
Do I get the job?

18:08.671 --> 18:09.755
Well...

18:09.839 --> 18:11.882
Take my Porsche.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.218
Drive it to the airport,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.512
and take the jet
to St. Barts.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.390
Take a mansion.
Take <i>all</i> my mansions!

18:19.473 --> 18:22.602
Oh, seriously,
I am so up for this.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.730
It's empowering!
It's exhilarating.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.441
I finally found the job for me!

18:28.524 --> 18:31.444
Uh... let me just
ask my supervisor.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.371
‐ He's OK with it.
‐ Yes!

18:42.455 --> 18:43.914
( both laughing )

18:43.998 --> 18:45.666
Oh, boy, um‐‐

18:45.750 --> 18:48.461
Oh. There's a lot
of politics, OK?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.463
Everyone's always
jockeying for position.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.465
They want to be
the boss's best buddy,

18:52.548 --> 18:54.258
they're trying to get in
with the guys in
the ninth circle.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.261
Just watch your back,
that's all I'm saying.

18:57.345 --> 19:00.306
‐ Good luck!
‐ Thank you! You too!

19:00.389 --> 19:01.974
‐ <i>( knocking on door )</i>
‐ Oh, who's that?

19:02.058 --> 19:03.768
Shit!
It's my next appointment.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.770
No, it's my first
appointment!

19:05.853 --> 19:07.188
Oh‐‐ ( laughs )

19:08.397 --> 19:10.358
‐ Hi! Come on in!
‐ Hi.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.360
Oh. I thought
there'd only be one
of you here.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.446
There is. Me!
I'm Jean.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.573
Louis was just about
to take off.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.619
Another customer
about to be satisfied.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.412
So you're a musician.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.748
Yep, that's why
I'm doin' this.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.417
I just wanna be
the greatest rock star
on the planet, ya know?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.420
Ah. Well,
good luck with that.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.632
She doesn't need luck.
She has us.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.843
‐ I don't actually drink.
‐ You don't drink?

19:37.927 --> 19:40.388
No, I'm straight edge.
I'm just all about
the music.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.598
Well, what's the point
of being a musician

19:42.682 --> 19:44.809
if you don't use it
to get fucked?

19:44.892 --> 19:46.977
In every sense
of the word.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.896
I just love playing,

19:48.979 --> 19:51.649
and I wanna be
the best that I can be

19:51.732 --> 19:53.609
and for everyone to hear it.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.946
( laughs )
How incredibly noble.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.989
Beth, right?

19:59.073 --> 20:01.826
‐ Yeah, sit down for a sec.
‐ OK.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.911
I have to ask you.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.289
If it's all about the music
for you,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.833
why do this?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.419
Why not just
practice even harder?

20:11.502 --> 20:13.713
She wants to take
the fast track, Louis.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.631
<i>That's what it is.</i>
<i>I mean,</i>

20:15.715 --> 20:18.008
why take the stairs
when you can take
the elevator?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.428
Ah, but the elevator
doesn't just go up,

20:20.511 --> 20:21.887
it also goes down.

20:21.971 --> 20:25.474
Beth has made a great effort
to come here tonight

20:25.558 --> 20:27.309
and sign a deal.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.521
Now, you and I have
already made our deal.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.732
So I think it's only right
that you left

20:32.815 --> 20:35.276
so that Beth and I
can do ours.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.946
I guess I'm just
very ambitious.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.866
And with streaming,
it's really hard

20:41.949 --> 20:43.659
to get a major label
to back you.

20:43.743 --> 20:48.581
I'm on Bandcamp
and SoundCloud and‐‐

20:48.664 --> 20:50.958
I'm just looking for
all the help I can get,
you know?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.502
Well, what if you approached
some of the mini‐majors,
you know?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.795
Because they can
get your stuff‐‐

20:54.879 --> 20:56.672
She wants to take
the elevator!

20:56.756 --> 20:59.049
<i>She's been very clear</i>
<i>about that.</i>

20:59.133 --> 21:03.471
She's always been
a "fuck the stairs"
kind of girl.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.891
Now, I'm cool with that,
and Beth is cool with that.

21:06.974 --> 21:10.644
<i>The only one apparently</i>
<i>not cool with that is</i> you.

21:10.728 --> 21:13.397
And I think it's time now
that you fuck off

21:13.481 --> 21:16.942
and let Beth and I start
the adventure of a lifetime.

21:30.873 --> 21:36.587
You don't need to worry
about reading the boring
terms and conditions.

21:36.670 --> 21:41.425
