WEBVTT

00:00.653 --> 00:03.288
We are here because we are powerless.

00:03.570 --> 00:05.072
I know I am.

00:05.826 --> 00:07.625
I just started the Fourth Step.

00:07.627 --> 00:12.797
"A fearless moral inventory
of all of my actions."

00:15.082 --> 00:18.303
Man, I'm here to tell you,
that one's a bitch.

00:20.129 --> 00:22.807
All the crap I'm hiding from the world.

00:22.809 --> 00:25.844
All the lies. All the guilt.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.716
If I don't come clean,
I'll start using again.

00:33.684 --> 00:35.353
It's like the Big Book says,

00:35.355 --> 00:37.354
it's your secrets that'll kill you.

00:57.124 --> 00:58.876
What's with the face-to-face?

01:00.377 --> 01:02.372
IRT supervisor called me this morning.

01:03.393 --> 01:05.025
All right, tell me exactly what he said.

01:05.027 --> 01:06.260
Do not leave out one detail.

01:06.262 --> 01:08.028
He said he wants to talk about

01:08.030 --> 01:09.635
the officer involved death
from a few months ago.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.684
He said there's certain parts
of my statement

01:10.686 --> 01:12.191
that aren't adding up.

01:12.356 --> 01:13.815
I thought the investigation
was cleared and closed

01:13.840 --> 01:14.895
two months ago.

01:14.920 --> 01:15.934
It was.

01:17.938 --> 01:19.628
All right, Hank, enough's enough.

01:19.630 --> 01:21.063
All right, this thing is on me.

01:21.065 --> 01:22.397
- Antonio...
- I need to tell the truth.

01:22.399 --> 01:23.932
You know you can't do that, Antonio.

01:23.934 --> 01:25.192
I'm the one that killed the guy.

01:25.194 --> 01:27.100
Yeah, I know, we're the ones
that covered it up for you.

01:27.101 --> 01:29.101
- I didn't ask you to do that.
- Bro, you didn't have to.

01:29.103 --> 01:31.103
We weren't gonna let you go
down so we rolled the dice.

01:31.105 --> 01:33.072
Now we just... we've got
to see it through.

01:33.074 --> 01:34.286
All right, listen to me.

01:35.370 --> 01:38.421
The only reason IRT is going
to reopen the investigation

01:38.423 --> 01:41.146
is by direct order of
Superintendent Kelton.

01:43.284 --> 01:45.017
So when do they want to see you?

01:45.019 --> 01:46.465
Within the week.

01:47.521 --> 01:49.321
All right, just keep your heads down.

01:49.323 --> 01:51.720
Stay the course. Don't talk to anybody.

01:52.460 --> 01:54.326
I know how to get in front of this.

01:54.328 --> 01:56.962
All right. All right.

02:01.002 --> 02:02.134
Boss.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.036
Yeah.

02:04.316 --> 02:06.138
Kev reached out. He needs some eyes.

02:06.140 --> 02:07.973
What's he rolling on?

02:07.975 --> 02:10.342
Uh, dry meet with a CI in Englewood.

02:10.344 --> 02:11.810
All right, you two head over there.

02:11.812 --> 02:13.879
Cover his ass.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.286
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

02:21.288 --> 02:22.855
Uh, that's Hugo. Hugo, this is Kevin.

02:22.857 --> 02:24.456
The one I was telling you about.

02:24.458 --> 02:26.025
What you got. Hugo?

02:26.027 --> 02:27.965
Heroin. Kilo.

02:29.163 --> 02:30.462
You didn't bring a taste?

02:30.464 --> 02:32.498
Nah, man. This stuff's pure.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.832
You'll see.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.402
Okay. Who you fronting for?

02:36.404 --> 02:37.703
Nobody.

02:37.705 --> 02:39.171
Just, uh, trying to start my own game.

02:39.559 --> 02:41.640
<i>I got a straight Mexican connection.</i>

02:42.271 --> 02:44.043
<i>No strings attached.</i>

02:44.045 --> 02:45.878
Hmm.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.214
Yeah, so uh, what?
Y'all interested or what?

02:49.216 --> 02:50.549
It depends on what the price is.

02:50.551 --> 02:51.738
Talk to me.

02:52.386 --> 02:53.824
60,000.

02:54.822 --> 02:56.388
I can go 50.

02:56.390 --> 02:57.723
No, man. Come on.

02:57.725 --> 02:59.324
Look, I know this stuff's worth 60.

02:59.743 --> 03:00.761
Come on.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.995
50 or I'm gonna have to walk, Hugo.

03:04.564 --> 03:07.766
All right. Let's do 50 then.

03:07.768 --> 03:09.006
That's love.

03:09.965 --> 03:12.191
So, uh, how do y'all want to do this?

03:12.193 --> 03:13.518
Or what's... what's... what's next?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.507
Oh, I like this spot.
Let's meet right here tomorrow.

03:15.509 --> 03:18.077
I'll bring my bread, you bring my brick.

03:18.724 --> 03:20.913
All right, cool.

03:20.915 --> 03:22.714
Well, uh, yeah. I'll see y'all tomorrow.

03:22.716 --> 03:24.683
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

03:29.689 --> 03:31.390
Talk to me about where
you found this fool again.

03:31.392 --> 03:33.900
He just walked up on my
corner, said he had weight.

03:33.902 --> 03:36.595
Figured it was my chance
to work off my thing with you.

03:36.597 --> 03:38.263
Doesn't sit right.

03:38.265 --> 03:39.731
Mm-mm.

03:39.733 --> 03:41.934
I say we tail him,
put him down at a house,

03:41.936 --> 03:43.469
figure out who he's fronting for.

03:45.106 --> 03:46.438
Hey, run!

03:52.799 --> 03:54.446
One down! I got one down!

03:54.448 --> 03:55.447
Cover me! Cover me!

03:55.449 --> 03:56.470
I got you.

03:58.752 --> 04:01.553
5021 Ida, emergency.
We got a gunshot victim down.

04:01.555 --> 04:03.122
We need an ambulance now. We need help.

04:03.124 --> 04:05.124
- Can you hear me, huh?
<i>- Copy that, 5021 Ida.</i>

04:05.126 --> 04:06.558
Hugo, stay with me.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.127
Okay? Stay with me.

04:08.129 --> 04:10.896
<i>Hugo? Hugo, what was that? What happened?</i>

04:10.898 --> 04:12.564
<i>Hugo, are you okay? Stay with me, Hugo.</i>

04:12.566 --> 04:14.466
- Stay with me.
<i>- Baby, are you okay?</i>

04:14.468 --> 04:15.801
Come on... stay with me.

04:15.803 --> 04:17.302
<i>- What happened?
- Keep right here.</i>

04:17.303 --> 04:19.171
<i>Hugo!</i>

04:23.177 --> 04:25.444
Hugo Campos, 17 years old.

04:25.446 --> 04:27.312
Moved to Pilsen a year ago
with his mother.

04:27.314 --> 04:28.814
Clean sheet. No disciplinary issues.

04:28.816 --> 04:30.226
Gang affiliation?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.452
Uh, we're not sure.

04:31.454 --> 04:33.152
Talked to a few CI's,
but nobody knew him.

04:33.154 --> 04:35.487
All right, who runs the tip
where the kid got gunned down?

04:35.489 --> 04:37.489
His name is Derrick Winslow.

04:37.491 --> 04:38.657
He calls the shots in that area.

04:38.659 --> 04:39.992
He's real slick, low key,

04:39.994 --> 04:41.593
doesn't touch his product at all.

04:41.595 --> 04:43.360
His cousin also got lit up last month.

04:43.362 --> 04:44.530
Word on the street is

04:44.532 --> 04:46.098
a Mexican gang had something
to do with it.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.167
So maybe this was retaliation.

04:48.169 --> 04:51.336
Kevin, you got an idea
where to find this shot-caller?

04:51.338 --> 04:52.838
I can put some pressure on my CI.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.339
Good. Do it.

05:00.848 --> 05:02.314
Chicago PD! Put your hands up!

05:02.316 --> 05:04.349
Keep them right there, Winslow!

05:04.351 --> 05:06.118
Nice and easy, man.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.953
We just want to see hands.

05:07.955 --> 05:10.168
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Get out of the car.

05:10.724 --> 05:12.057
Get up against the car.

05:12.059 --> 05:13.192
Oh, whoa!

05:13.194 --> 05:15.494
You coming at me kind of tough, ain't ya?

05:15.496 --> 05:17.529
What's this all about?

05:17.531 --> 05:19.219
You drove through a stop sign.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.734
Hello, Derrick.

05:22.736 --> 05:24.836
"Hello, Derrick"?

05:24.838 --> 05:26.738
Come on, man.
Why are you doing this to me?

05:26.740 --> 05:29.074
Because someone did that Latino boy,

05:29.076 --> 05:31.310
the one who got lit up
on your turf this morning.

05:31.312 --> 05:32.711
I had nothing to do with that.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.180
Derrick, nothing goes down
in this neighborhood

05:35.182 --> 05:36.987
without your okay.

05:37.651 --> 05:40.031
You need to tell us who did it.

05:40.521 --> 05:42.521
Y'all just fishing.

05:42.523 --> 05:44.056
You can't hang that shooting on me.

05:44.058 --> 05:46.658
We can hang this on you.
Found it in your ashtray.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.193
Oops.

05:48.195 --> 05:49.728
That's medicinal.

05:49.730 --> 05:51.597
- I get migraines.
- That's great.

05:51.599 --> 05:52.998
We're gonna need to see your card.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
If not, we're confiscating your car.

05:55.002 --> 05:57.132
- For a blunt?
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.871 --> 05:59.504
Y'all wouldn't do that.

05:59.506 --> 06:01.073
Try us.

06:01.075 --> 06:02.574
Who shot the boy?

06:05.746 --> 06:08.513
All right, I swear
it wasn't nobody from my set.

06:08.515 --> 06:10.949
One of my corner boys says
he saw a black van

06:10.951 --> 06:13.752
screaming down 59th
right after the shooting.

06:13.754 --> 06:16.188
Okay, and whoever was driving
it wasn't one of us.

06:16.190 --> 06:18.790
So if I may?

06:18.792 --> 06:23.228
If y'all are done sweating me,
can I keep my wheels?

06:24.230 --> 06:26.536
If your story checks out, sure.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.301
Go have a seat in the car.

06:33.707 --> 06:35.707
Hugo wanted to be an artist.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.477
- It's beautiful.
- He was my only child.

06:38.479 --> 06:40.646
All we had was each other.

06:40.648 --> 06:43.382
I'm sorry. I know this is difficult.

06:43.384 --> 06:45.217
Was Hugo in any trouble?

06:45.219 --> 06:46.251
No.

06:46.253 --> 06:48.253
He was either at school or at his job.

06:48.683 --> 06:50.589
Okay, and where was he working?

06:50.591 --> 06:52.457
La Casera.

06:52.459 --> 06:53.992
- Okay.
- He worked as a busboy.

06:54.439 --> 06:55.827
Was he involved in any gangs?

06:55.829 --> 06:57.734
I know that he wasn't.

06:58.265 --> 06:59.498
They tried to force him

06:59.500 --> 07:01.633
and bully him where we used to live.

07:01.635 --> 07:03.769
That's why we moved here.

07:03.771 --> 07:05.771
It's supposed to be safer.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.172
Do you have any idea how

07:07.174 --> 07:09.941
Hugo might've gotten ahold of heroin?

07:09.943 --> 07:12.666
Hugo was not involved with drugs.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.180
Kim.

07:17.921 --> 07:19.484
What is that?

07:20.988 --> 07:22.884
Found it in Hugo's closet.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.845
It's a kilo of heroin, ma'am.

07:26.427 --> 07:29.094
No. You're wrong.

07:29.096 --> 07:30.529
It's not possible.

07:30.531 --> 07:33.265
That is not who my son is.

07:37.838 --> 07:39.192
Hey, Trudy.

07:40.819 --> 07:42.507
Listen, I need a favor.

07:42.509 --> 07:43.942
Yeah, what's going on?

07:43.944 --> 07:45.444
I remember you telling me your father

07:45.446 --> 07:47.846
kind of rubbed elbows
with a lot of big shots

07:47.848 --> 07:49.181
in the publishing world.

07:49.183 --> 07:52.284
Elbows, knees, other body parts possibly.

07:52.286 --> 07:53.352
Why?

07:53.354 --> 07:55.020
I need an introduction.

07:55.022 --> 07:57.544
It's got to be someone
with power who I can trust.

07:58.587 --> 08:00.525
Hank, you've enjoyed a long career

08:00.527 --> 08:02.728
by avoiding the press like the plague.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.730
Yeah, well, I don't have a choice

08:04.732 --> 08:07.366
and I can't get into details.

08:07.368 --> 08:11.370
But I need someone who doesn't
answer to anybody.

08:11.372 --> 08:13.143
Got to be their own man.

08:13.935 --> 08:15.644
Well, the man you need is a woman.

08:15.646 --> 08:17.008
Katherine Bradley.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.144
You've got to be kidding me.
You know Katherine Bradley?

08:19.146 --> 08:21.880
Yeah, one of the perks of
being my father's daughter.

08:21.882 --> 08:23.612
I can set it up.

08:24.551 --> 08:26.985
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Yeah.

08:29.222 --> 08:31.556
Appreciate you meeting me, Mrs. Bradley.

08:31.558 --> 08:35.193
Please, it's Katherine.
Formality makes me feel old.

08:35.195 --> 08:36.695
Katherine.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.731
Trudy tells me you got a
story that might be newsworthy.

08:39.732 --> 08:40.999
I do.

08:41.001 --> 08:42.567
Do you remember that serial killer

08:42.568 --> 08:44.034
that we caught a few weeks ago?

08:44.037 --> 08:45.937
Yes, we already published the story.

08:45.939 --> 08:48.573
Yeah, well, not this story.

08:49.012 --> 08:52.377
That same serial killer
was active a few years ago.

08:52.724 --> 08:55.080
And that email from
Detective Leo Hernandez

08:55.082 --> 08:59.117
proves that the CPD
knew about it and covered it up

08:59.119 --> 09:01.358
under orders of Brian Kelton.

09:02.525 --> 09:05.090
As in the next mayor
of Chicago Brian Kelton.

09:05.092 --> 09:07.726
Four women were killed
after that email was sent.

09:07.728 --> 09:10.362
They'd still be alive today.

09:10.364 --> 09:12.030
Those bodies are on Kelton.

09:12.032 --> 09:15.233
I will have to interview
this Detective Leo Hernandez

09:15.235 --> 09:17.068
and corroborate these accusations.

09:17.070 --> 09:19.704
It has to be published
before the election.

09:19.706 --> 09:22.207
It has to be bulletproof.

09:22.209 --> 09:23.775
I've been doing this a long time.

09:23.777 --> 09:25.544
You're gonna take a shot at the king?

09:25.546 --> 09:27.646
You better not miss.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.212
What'd you get?

09:41.219 --> 09:43.407
Uh, shooting happened at 9:02 a.m.

09:43.409 --> 09:46.556
Derrick said his boy saw
a black van fleeing...

09:46.986 --> 09:48.825
right there.

09:48.827 --> 09:51.728
We have surveillance on it until
Pilsen and then we lose it.

09:51.730 --> 09:54.126
Looks like two guys inside.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.886
Anything you can run through facial rec?

09:55.888 --> 09:56.952
Nah.

09:56.954 --> 09:58.591
I got a hit on a plate though.

09:58.592 --> 10:00.024
Car was reported stolen this morning.

10:00.026 --> 10:01.459
It's registered to Carlos Martinez.

10:01.461 --> 10:03.128
He's got one prior, aggravated battery.

10:03.130 --> 10:05.296
Got into a street fight,
beat the guy to a pulp.

10:05.298 --> 10:06.698
Address?

10:07.090 --> 10:09.300
Uh, 23rd Street in Pilsen.
It's a restaurant.

10:09.302 --> 10:10.602
La Casera.

10:10.604 --> 10:12.604
That's where Hugo Campos worked.

10:12.971 --> 10:14.097
Let's hit it.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.942
Carlos Martinez?

10:17.944 --> 10:19.177
That's right.

10:19.179 --> 10:20.712
Detective Dawson and Officer Burgess.

10:20.714 --> 10:21.880
Are you the owner?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.181
I'm the manager.

10:23.183 --> 10:24.516
Oh, I hear this place is great.

10:24.518 --> 10:25.950
You heard right.

10:25.952 --> 10:28.686
It's thanks to my brother. He's the chef.

10:29.279 --> 10:31.523
He's been to cooking school.
He's an artist with the food.

10:31.525 --> 10:32.724
He paints with pig.

10:32.726 --> 10:34.359
You guys hungry?

10:34.361 --> 10:36.027
Some other time.

10:36.029 --> 10:38.796
So, Carlos, you reported
your van stolen, is that right?

10:38.798 --> 10:40.628
Yeah, it happened this morning.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.000
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

10:42.002 --> 10:44.597
Do you know this guy? Hugo Campos.

10:44.622 --> 10:46.388
Yeah, he worked as a busboy here.

10:46.390 --> 10:48.424
Why are you talking about him
in the past tense?

10:48.426 --> 10:49.958
Because he quit a week ago.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.427
Did he give a reason?

10:51.429 --> 10:53.796
Restaurant business. People come and go.

10:53.798 --> 10:55.998
The reason we're asking
is because Hugo Campos

10:56.000 --> 10:57.299
was gunned down from your vehicle

10:57.301 --> 10:59.134
this morning at 9:00 a.m.,

10:59.136 --> 11:02.237
which was an hour before
you reported your van stolen.

11:02.239 --> 11:04.973
Can you explain that to us, Carlos?

11:06.566 --> 11:08.310
I don't know exactly
when the van was stolen.

11:08.312 --> 11:10.779
Okay, well, where were you at 9:00 a.m.?

11:10.781 --> 11:12.147
I was here with my brother.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.682
- Can anybody else verify that?
- No.

11:13.684 --> 11:17.686
We were alone setting up,
like we do every morning.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.624
Now, if you don't mind,
we're about to get busy.

11:23.327 --> 11:25.894
Oh, well, excuse us.

11:32.169 --> 11:33.843
We'll be in touch.

11:39.009 --> 11:41.443
Think we rattled his cage hard enough?

11:41.445 --> 11:42.811
We'll see.

11:44.014 --> 11:46.381
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:47.565 --> 11:49.359
That's Alex Del Toro.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.520
Do you know him?

11:51.522 --> 11:54.356
Yeah, he's a major drug supplier.

11:54.358 --> 11:57.359
He killed one of my CI's nine years ago,

11:57.361 --> 11:58.910
but I couldn't prove it.

12:00.331 --> 12:03.213
So we went fishing for
minnows and we hooked a whale.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.804
Alex Del Toro.

12:08.806 --> 12:10.772
He's a major player in Pilsen.

12:10.774 --> 12:13.041
He's got direct connections
to Mexican cartels.

12:13.043 --> 12:16.678
He's been a source of supply
for heroin and coke for years.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.414
But he doesn't call attention.
He stays off the radar.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.750
Narcotics has tried, but they
could've put a glove on him.

12:21.752 --> 12:23.218
I worked this guy.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.586
Let me tell you something,

12:24.588 --> 12:26.989
there is nothing about him that's good.

12:28.321 --> 12:29.558
Mike Flores.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.061
He was my CI. He was a low-level player.

12:34.365 --> 12:35.864
Del Toro thought he was stealing products

12:35.866 --> 12:36.865
when he killed him,

12:36.867 --> 12:38.066
but we couldn't prove it.

12:38.068 --> 12:39.368
All right, so what's the connection

12:39.370 --> 12:40.736
between Hugo and Del Toro?

12:40.738 --> 12:42.204
The restaurant.

12:42.206 --> 12:44.840
I pulled the business
license for La Casera.

12:44.842 --> 12:46.742
Now Carlos Martinez is the manager.

12:46.744 --> 12:49.244
But the owner, that's Alex Del Toro.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.612
He owns a bunch of cash businesses.

12:50.614 --> 12:52.247
That's how he launders his drug proceeds.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.016
That was Todd Harris from
Auto Theft Robbery.

12:54.018 --> 12:56.585
They got Martinez's stolen van
at a chop shop in Pilsen.

12:56.587 --> 13:00.305
Okay, Jay. You, me, Kevin,
Adam, let's roll on it.

13:01.091 --> 13:03.091
This place is notorious.

13:03.093 --> 13:04.793
All five of these vehicles are hot.

13:04.795 --> 13:06.261
There's your van.

13:06.644 --> 13:08.228
All right, Kevin. You and Adam, glove up.

13:08.230 --> 13:09.598
- Check it out.
- Copy that.

13:09.939 --> 13:11.300
And that guy took possession of the keys

13:11.302 --> 13:12.601
when the van came in.

13:12.603 --> 13:14.403
Fernando Diaz, illegal immigrant.

13:14.405 --> 13:16.204
- What else did he give up?
- Oh, when we found out

13:16.206 --> 13:18.073
Intelligence was chasing the van,

13:18.075 --> 13:19.374
we stopped asking questions.

13:19.376 --> 13:20.976
Thought we'd give you first crack.

13:20.978 --> 13:22.118
I'll go talk to him.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.880
Hablas ingles, Fernando?

13:24.882 --> 13:26.281
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.082
You here when they brought that van in?

13:29.542 --> 13:30.652
How many people?

13:30.654 --> 13:31.620
Two.

13:31.622 --> 13:33.171
Can you describe them to me?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.257
No. It was dark.

13:36.994 --> 13:38.426
It was 10:00 a.m.

13:38.796 --> 13:40.228
I couldn't see them.

13:40.230 --> 13:41.596
Boss.

13:42.466 --> 13:43.799
- Yeah?
- Found shell casings.

13:43.801 --> 13:45.634
Same caliber as recovered
at the shooting.

13:45.636 --> 13:47.727
- Bag them.
- Copy that.

13:49.806 --> 13:51.064
You got working papers?

13:52.231 --> 13:53.609
No.

13:53.611 --> 13:56.011
Look, usually we don't care
about immigration status.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.479
The problem is you have information

13:57.481 --> 13:59.014
that could help us solve a murder.

13:59.016 --> 14:00.616
So if you're not willing to help,

14:00.618 --> 14:02.617
then I'm gonna be forced
to hand you over to ICE.

14:03.287 --> 14:04.577
It's your call.

14:05.255 --> 14:06.655
And if I help you?

14:07.121 --> 14:08.323
You'll keep doing what you're doing.

14:08.325 --> 14:09.332
Nobody will know.

14:10.792 --> 14:12.861
Can you describe their faces to me?

14:15.031 --> 14:16.665
Yes.

14:20.170 --> 14:22.037
We believe Alex Del Toro

14:22.039 --> 14:24.006
was the triggerman this morning.

14:24.008 --> 14:25.674
- Alex Del Toro?
- Yup.

14:26.140 --> 14:28.877
We got an eyewitness who puts
Del Toro and one accomplice

14:28.879 --> 14:31.146
in the van right after the shooting.

14:31.148 --> 14:32.714
That's gonna be hard to build a case on.

14:32.716 --> 14:33.847
I know.

14:33.849 --> 14:37.235
But it'll be a lot harder if
Del Toro leaves the country.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.323
So we want to grab him before
he knows we're onto him.

14:41.656 --> 14:44.226
We use the 48 hours to build a case.

14:44.228 --> 14:46.862
I'll call the ASA. Get the clock ticking.

14:46.864 --> 14:48.067
Thanks, Kate.

14:48.069 --> 14:51.500
Hank, there's something else.

14:52.568 --> 14:53.960
Okay.

15:01.843 --> 15:05.180
Katherine Bradley contacted my office.

15:05.182 --> 15:06.682
She asked for clarifications

15:06.684 --> 15:09.751
about the serial killer
your team pinched.

15:09.753 --> 15:12.187
I assume you're the one behind it.

15:15.892 --> 15:17.993
You are making a mistake.

15:17.995 --> 15:19.428
You come after Kelton like this,

15:19.430 --> 15:22.264
somebody is gonna get hurt,
and it won't be Kelton.

15:22.266 --> 15:24.733
He'll win, Hank. He always wins.

15:24.735 --> 15:25.700
Kate...

15:26.403 --> 15:28.070
why are you protecting him?

15:28.529 --> 15:31.773
Brian Kelton is going to be
mayor of Chicago in one week.

15:31.775 --> 15:33.442
That is a fact.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.444
You need to come to peace with it, Hank.

15:35.446 --> 15:37.012
If Kelton gets elected,

15:37.014 --> 15:38.213
his first order of business

15:38.215 --> 15:40.248
will be to disband Intelligence.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.050
That is not peace.

15:43.287 --> 15:44.920
That is war.

15:55.264 --> 15:57.165
Alex Del Toro.

15:57.167 --> 15:59.067
You know, I can't believe
you've never been

15:59.069 --> 16:00.693
in this room before.

16:03.307 --> 16:06.308
I haven't been here
because I don't belong here.

16:06.310 --> 16:09.077
You've obviously made
some kind of mistake.

16:09.079 --> 16:13.148
If that's the case, maybe
you can help us clear this up.

16:13.635 --> 16:15.374
Hugo Campos.

16:17.286 --> 16:19.321
He was killed this morning in a drive-by.

16:19.323 --> 16:21.123
Hmm, that's too bad.

16:21.464 --> 16:22.958
You know him?

16:30.333 --> 16:31.800
No.

16:31.802 --> 16:33.068
Hmm.

16:33.070 --> 16:35.337
Works as a busboy at your restaurant?

16:35.339 --> 16:37.906
- Hmm.
- La Casera.

16:38.314 --> 16:41.910
I'm only a silent partner.
I let Carlos do what he wants.

16:41.912 --> 16:44.737
That's not what Carlos said.
He's in the next room.

16:45.449 --> 16:48.250
He's scared as hell.
He said Hugo stole your drugs.

16:48.252 --> 16:50.085
You found him and you lit him up.

16:50.326 --> 16:53.188
You got an alibi
for this morning at 9:00?

16:53.190 --> 16:54.556
- Oh, yes.
- Hmm.

16:54.558 --> 16:56.691
I was with my wife, Claire.

16:56.999 --> 16:58.459
Huh.

17:10.707 --> 17:12.007
Yeah?

17:12.009 --> 17:14.433
Sorry, Hank, I walked
as slowly as I could.

17:15.977 --> 17:18.113
My client's done talking.

17:18.115 --> 17:20.182
All right, relax.

17:20.184 --> 17:21.773
Hmm.

17:22.752 --> 17:25.787
<i>Carlos, you seem like a pretty solid guy.</i>

17:26.823 --> 17:29.791
Why go into business with Alex Del Toro?

17:29.793 --> 17:31.693
He's just an investor in the restaurant.

17:31.695 --> 17:33.995
Why is he so nice to you?

17:34.398 --> 17:36.497
My father died when we were little.

17:37.874 --> 17:39.835
Alex stepped in and took care of us.

17:39.837 --> 17:42.704
Me and my brother. He's family.

17:42.706 --> 17:46.641
He's also a source of supply
for heroin coming into Chicago.

17:47.844 --> 17:49.377
I don't know anything about that.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.213
People in your neighborhood say they see

17:51.215 --> 17:52.380
you driving Del Toro around a lot.

17:52.722 --> 17:54.432
That's not against the law.

17:55.552 --> 17:59.421
No, it's not.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.756
But this is.

18:03.259 --> 18:05.660
Were you driving Del Toro this morning?

18:06.896 --> 18:08.154
Nope.

18:09.099 --> 18:12.834
He's right next door,
giving his version of events.

18:12.836 --> 18:15.604
This is your one chance to
tell us what really happened

18:15.606 --> 18:17.706
before he throws you under the bus.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.342
Give us Del Toro. Come clean.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.911
And we will help you.

18:24.780 --> 18:29.251
Like I said, somebody stole my van.

18:36.226 --> 18:37.525
Now remember what I said,

18:37.527 --> 18:38.960
you've got nothing to worry about.

18:38.962 --> 18:41.229
'Cause they can't see
your face, all right?

18:43.734 --> 18:45.399
All right, take a look.

18:46.776 --> 18:49.537
All right, recognize the man
who brought the van?

18:56.545 --> 18:58.280
I'm pretty sure it's number three.

18:59.148 --> 19:01.747
You just... take your time, all right?

19:01.749 --> 19:02.884
You don't have to rush.

19:02.886 --> 19:05.720
- He gave you his answer.
- Okay, please be quiet.

19:05.722 --> 19:07.922
It's all right. Take another look.

19:14.011 --> 19:16.131
It's number three. I'm positive.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.767
Let the record reflect

19:18.769 --> 19:21.169
that the person your witness
ID'd is not my client.

19:21.171 --> 19:22.728
I want him released.

19:23.273 --> 19:24.506
You have nothing.

19:24.508 --> 19:26.374
I got 36 hours.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.109
We'll see.

19:28.812 --> 19:30.478
The hell are you doing?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.147
You know that's not the man you saw.

19:33.917 --> 19:36.117
What's on your phone? Who's texting you?

19:37.087 --> 19:38.520
Who's in the photo?

19:39.203 --> 19:41.497
My children in Mexico.

19:42.259 --> 19:45.026
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

19:54.549 --> 19:56.661
Fernando Diaz isn't being charged.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.094
He's on his way back to Mexico.

19:58.096 --> 19:59.896
All right, what do we know
about the kids?

19:59.898 --> 20:02.260
Platt's trying to reach out
to the Mexican police.

20:02.262 --> 20:04.434
We're doing what we can,
but we can't do much.

20:04.927 --> 20:06.760
Do you know if Del Toro got to him?

20:06.762 --> 20:08.195
Well, like I said,

20:08.197 --> 20:09.730
Del Toro's got reach all
the way to Mexico.

20:09.732 --> 20:10.837
He's smart.

20:10.839 --> 20:13.867
Well, we've got to be smarter
and we're on the clock.

20:13.869 --> 20:15.502
Let's come at this a different way.

20:15.504 --> 20:17.337
All right, Del Toro is a known supplier

20:17.339 --> 20:19.306
and Hugo Campos was found
with a kilo in his bedroom.

20:19.308 --> 20:20.974
We got the restaurant as a nexus.

20:20.976 --> 20:23.329
It's a licensed premises,
so we don't need a warrant.

20:23.331 --> 20:24.745
We could just walk right in.

20:24.747 --> 20:26.413
All right, let's do a city license check

20:26.415 --> 20:28.916
and go for maximum disruption.

20:29.211 --> 20:31.952
Shake the tree. See what falls out.

20:33.555 --> 20:35.088
Kitchen looks clean.

20:35.090 --> 20:36.290
Of course it's clean.

20:36.292 --> 20:37.925
We're going to see all your licenses.

20:37.927 --> 20:39.426
Hey, you got a key for this lock?

20:39.428 --> 20:42.055
No, it's Carlos' office.
Not the restaurant.

20:42.057 --> 20:45.232
Hey look, just so you know,
your brother's in a lot of trouble.

20:45.234 --> 20:48.001
He didn't kill Hugo.
He's out of that life.

20:48.003 --> 20:49.903
I don't think he pulled the trigger.

20:49.905 --> 20:51.712
But he's not helping himself out.

20:51.714 --> 20:53.652
I know he cares a lot about you.

20:53.654 --> 20:55.488
So maybe you can talk sense into him.

20:56.739 --> 20:58.045
My brother can take care of himself.

20:58.047 --> 21:00.113
He's taking care of Alex Del Toro.

21:00.115 --> 21:02.916
Now I know you both feel loyalty for him.

21:02.918 --> 21:05.252
But unless your brother comes clean,

21:05.254 --> 21:07.788
he's going to be the one
that winds up in jail.

21:10.169 --> 21:12.893
Like I said, Carlos
can take care of himself.

21:17.551 --> 21:18.832
I found that under the floorboard

21:18.834 --> 21:20.500
along with six other bricks.

21:20.502 --> 21:22.970
Same stamp as the brick in Hugo's room.

21:27.343 --> 21:29.298
I don't know a lot about Mexican cuisine,

21:29.300 --> 21:33.280
but I don't think heroin is
one of the main ingredients.

21:33.282 --> 21:35.082
That's not mine.

21:35.084 --> 21:37.297
It was in the false floor of the office

21:37.322 --> 21:38.988
and your name is on the lease.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.357
You're looking at possession
with intent to distribute.

21:41.359 --> 21:43.793
Eight years minimum.

21:43.795 --> 21:45.661
Or there's another option.

21:45.663 --> 21:47.330
You tell us what happened this morning.

21:47.332 --> 21:48.531
I already told you...

21:48.533 --> 21:49.834
Del Toro's gonna walk

21:50.635 --> 21:53.636
and you're going to jail for eight years.

21:55.405 --> 21:57.406
Eight years ain't nothing.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.811
I'll eat whatever you got.

22:01.813 --> 22:04.146
- No, that's not what you want.
- Antonio.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.481
We need you.

22:18.028 --> 22:19.488
We got a problem.

22:20.498 --> 22:21.866
What's going on?

22:22.900 --> 22:24.326
All right, look,

22:25.003 --> 22:27.536
the "Tribune" is ready
to publish an article

22:27.538 --> 22:29.905
about Kelton covering up
the serial killings.

22:29.907 --> 22:33.309
But the detective we need
to verify the accusations,

22:33.311 --> 22:34.753
Leo Hernandez,

22:35.513 --> 22:37.173
he's in the wind.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.651
Do you think Kelton got to him?

22:41.653 --> 22:44.687
Look, all I know,
Leo took a leave of absence.

22:44.689 --> 22:47.490
He's not in his apartment.
He's ducking his calls.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.958
We need to find him.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.360
Okay, wait. What if we don't?

22:51.362 --> 22:52.980
We will.

22:53.531 --> 22:55.865
But if we don't and Kelton gets elected,

22:55.867 --> 22:57.130
we can't stop the investigation.

22:57.132 --> 22:59.735
Antonio, hey, hey. We're gonna find him.

22:59.737 --> 23:01.951
Yeah, and we've got to move fast, okay?

23:01.953 --> 23:04.040
The election's in a week.

23:04.042 --> 23:07.017
So dig into Leo's financials.
Start tracking his movements.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.556
Hey.

23:20.558 --> 23:22.525
Hey.

23:22.527 --> 23:24.193
Oh, what's up, baby?

23:24.195 --> 23:25.761
It's so good to see you.

23:25.763 --> 23:26.722
Yeah.

23:31.068 --> 23:32.868
Thanks for taking the time, Dom.

23:32.870 --> 23:35.471
A man can take only so much Netflix.

23:35.473 --> 23:38.040
What's on your mind?

23:39.743 --> 23:42.321
It's kind of a hypothetical situation.

23:42.947 --> 23:45.281
I wanted to get an FOP lawyer's
perspective on it.

23:45.283 --> 23:46.482
Off the record.

23:46.484 --> 23:48.744
Won't go farther than this table.

23:52.556 --> 23:54.957
Say a police officer is in the act

23:54.959 --> 23:57.993
of arresting a non-compliant offender,

23:57.995 --> 24:00.381
and he accidentally kills that offender.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.933
That would be an unfortunate
outcome, but it happens.

24:03.935 --> 24:06.469
IRT and COPA would do
their investigations

24:06.471 --> 24:08.170
and clear the officer.

24:08.172 --> 24:09.905
But you already knew this.

24:12.776 --> 24:15.444
What if the officer involved
was taking medication?

24:15.446 --> 24:17.481
Were these medicines prescribed?

24:19.416 --> 24:20.649
No.

24:20.651 --> 24:24.655
- So he was high.
- Yeah.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.024
Was he tested at the scene?

24:32.829 --> 24:35.998
Uh, he left the scene

24:36.000 --> 24:38.168
and his fellow officers covered for him.

24:43.174 --> 24:46.108
Would it be possible for this officer

24:46.110 --> 24:49.278
to take full responsibility
for his actions after the fact?

24:50.814 --> 24:52.725
Why would he do that?

24:55.852 --> 24:57.653
So he could live with himself

24:58.480 --> 25:00.523
and get his fellow officers off the hook.

25:05.530 --> 25:06.989
Is there any way?

25:08.946 --> 25:10.284
No.

25:11.402 --> 25:12.701
All three of these officers

25:12.703 --> 25:14.336
involved in the incident would be fired.

25:14.338 --> 25:17.573
And the officer who killed the
offender while he was impaired

25:17.833 --> 25:19.501
would get jail time.

25:22.078 --> 25:27.548
Antonio, there's
no hypothetical happy ending.

25:37.021 --> 25:38.479
Hey, Boss?

25:39.490 --> 25:41.490
I've been digging into Leo Hernandez.

25:41.492 --> 25:42.983
Okay, hold on.

25:45.452 --> 25:47.019
So he shut his phone off.

25:47.021 --> 25:48.688
Made me think he might try and skip town.

25:48.690 --> 25:50.256
I talked to the transportation team.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.238
Sure enough, he's booked
on a Southwest flight.

25:52.239 --> 25:53.605
Leaves in a few hours.

25:53.607 --> 25:55.374
Why didn't we get this
from Asset Forfeiture?

25:55.376 --> 25:56.942
He didn't buy the ticket.

25:56.944 --> 25:58.877
It was purchased by a woman
named Gloria Mitchell.

25:58.879 --> 26:00.712
I ran her through Lexus Nexus.

26:00.714 --> 26:03.782
Mitchell is her married name.
She was born Hernandez.

26:03.784 --> 26:05.617
- His sister.
- Uh-huh.

26:05.619 --> 26:07.686
She lives at 4217 Racine.

26:07.688 --> 26:09.438
Come on. Let's go.

26:13.861 --> 26:15.461
Leo.

26:21.735 --> 26:25.070
Hank, I was gonna call ya.

26:25.072 --> 26:27.873
Yeah, you kind of disappeared on me.

26:27.875 --> 26:30.042
Just taking some time off.

26:31.345 --> 26:33.145
Kelton get to ya?

26:33.147 --> 26:36.048
- No.
- Then why you running away?

26:42.323 --> 26:44.056
I can't do it, Hank.

26:44.058 --> 26:46.925
I can't blow the whistle on Kelton.

26:46.927 --> 26:49.425
You got to do what's right here, Leo.

26:49.864 --> 26:53.932
You know what happens to a
cop that rats out another cop.

26:53.934 --> 26:56.001
I've got to protect my family.

26:56.003 --> 26:57.975
You know who didn't get protected?

26:59.607 --> 27:02.938
Lexie Wright, my friend.

27:03.611 --> 27:06.678
Shanele Martin,
Gina Martinez, Rachel Jones.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.682
And four other Jane Does whose
bones we can't even identify.

27:11.951 --> 27:14.086
Listen, if Kelton hadn't
covered up the existence

27:14.088 --> 27:17.789
of that serial killer, those
women would still be alive.

27:17.791 --> 27:19.558
I mean, that's on Kelton.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.832
If you don't do what's right here...

27:23.297 --> 27:24.876
then it's on you.

27:28.602 --> 27:30.299
I know you, Leo.

27:31.071 --> 27:34.907
I know this is haunting you
like it's haunting me.

27:36.943 --> 27:39.016
I'm calling Katherine Bradley.

27:39.647 --> 27:41.747
And you're going to tell her the truth.

27:44.017 --> 27:46.151
Mrs. Bradley, it's Sergeant Hank Voight.

27:46.153 --> 27:48.387
I've got Detective Leo Hernandez here.

27:48.389 --> 27:50.068
He wants to talk to you.

27:52.258 --> 27:53.739
Leo.

27:56.195 --> 27:58.452
You're doing the right thing, Leo.

28:00.967 --> 28:02.414
We'll see.

28:03.304 --> 28:04.791
Mrs. Bradley.

28:16.616 --> 28:17.849
Trudy, what the hell happened?

28:17.851 --> 28:19.251
I thought we still had time.

28:19.253 --> 28:22.621
ASA said to kick him. It is what it is.

28:22.623 --> 28:24.856
There's no evidence, no case,

28:24.858 --> 28:26.692
and no point in wasting anybody's time.

28:26.694 --> 28:28.093
Let's go.

28:28.095 --> 28:29.995
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

28:30.526 --> 28:31.997
You might be walking out now,

28:31.999 --> 28:33.737
but I'll be the one walking you back.

28:34.501 --> 28:36.301
I remember you.

28:36.303 --> 28:39.871
You took a shot at me
years ago and you missed.

28:39.873 --> 28:41.940
I won't miss this time.

28:41.942 --> 28:44.710
Oh, I love your passion.

28:44.712 --> 28:48.146
I will get you. I promise.

28:50.217 --> 28:53.218
Don't make promises you can't keep.

29:02.495 --> 29:03.829
Excuse me, Señora.

29:09.303 --> 29:11.136
Who was that man?

29:11.138 --> 29:13.405
That's Alex Del Toro. Do you know him?

29:13.407 --> 29:14.840
No.

29:14.842 --> 29:16.530
Does he have something to do with

29:17.378 --> 29:19.116
my son's killing?

29:20.180 --> 29:21.743
Come here.

29:24.454 --> 29:25.717
We think he does.

29:25.719 --> 29:27.552
Then why are you letting him go?

29:27.554 --> 29:28.553
What are you doing?

29:28.555 --> 29:29.855
Because we can't prove it.

29:29.857 --> 29:31.044
But you know?

29:31.925 --> 29:34.393
We don't have evidence.
We don't have a confession.

29:35.895 --> 29:37.301
I'm so sorry.

29:38.885 --> 29:40.399
What bring you here?

29:40.401 --> 29:43.515
You told me to come to you if
I had anything that might help.

29:44.738 --> 29:47.072
A man came to my house
right after you did.

29:49.075 --> 29:50.342
Hugo's boss.

29:50.344 --> 29:52.244
He said it was to pay for the funeral.

29:52.246 --> 29:55.947
He said the neighborhood was
very sorry for what happened.

29:58.084 --> 29:59.823
Is this who you're speaking of?

30:00.721 --> 30:01.973
That's him.

30:08.128 --> 30:09.791
You gave her blood money.

30:10.698 --> 30:12.002
What are you talking about?

30:12.966 --> 30:15.767
Lucia Campos, the mother
of the boy who was gunned down.

30:15.769 --> 30:17.069
Take a seat.

30:17.071 --> 30:19.137
You gave her $3,000.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.440
That's what you do when
something bad happens

30:21.442 --> 30:22.554
to your neighbors.

30:23.477 --> 30:24.843
No, it's what you do

30:24.845 --> 30:26.308
when you can't live with
something you've done.

30:27.281 --> 30:31.396
You saw that boy get murdered
and you let it happen.

30:32.086 --> 30:33.656
Now the guilt is killing you.

30:37.591 --> 30:39.154
That crucifix?

30:40.294 --> 30:43.395
That's your salvation or your noose.

30:48.001 --> 30:49.314
I can't.

30:53.474 --> 30:57.008
The only way to save
your soul is to confess

30:57.010 --> 30:58.777
and you know that.

30:58.779 --> 31:00.300
If I tell the truth...

31:02.182 --> 31:04.554
no matter how good that's
gonna make me feel,

31:05.385 --> 31:07.819
Alex Del Toro will kill my brother.

31:11.492 --> 31:14.326
You've been protecting
your brother all along.

31:16.597 --> 31:18.029
Would you save your soul

31:18.031 --> 31:19.898
if it meant hurting the people you love?

31:43.055 --> 31:44.761
We will protect your brother.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.315
Just say what happened.

31:58.204 --> 32:00.152
Del Toro came to me.

32:01.241 --> 32:03.842
He thought that Hugo stole his drugs.

32:03.844 --> 32:05.544
A brick of heroin from the office.

32:05.546 --> 32:07.045
Yeah.

32:07.047 --> 32:09.748
I didn't even know
that was there, I swear.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.483
Del Toro uses that room.

32:16.423 --> 32:21.059
We were just going to lean on
Hugo, find out what happened,

32:21.061 --> 32:22.548
teach him a lesson.

32:27.568 --> 32:29.701
I didn't even know Del Toro had a gun.

32:33.829 --> 32:36.675
He never said anything
about killing anybody.

32:43.717 --> 32:45.116
Hear from the ASA?

32:45.118 --> 32:46.585
She's on her way to take his statement.

32:46.587 --> 32:48.550
Well, we can't wait.
Any word on Del Toro?

32:48.552 --> 32:49.557
Not yet.

32:49.559 --> 32:51.217
Patrol units in the area
just hit his house.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.391
His wife said he packed a bag,
he left two hours ago.

32:53.393 --> 32:55.927
All right, put out
a statewide BOLO on Del Toro.

32:55.929 --> 32:58.330
He's a flight risk.
He's got a head start.

32:58.332 --> 33:00.599
I want his photo in every
bus station and airport.

33:00.601 --> 33:02.467
What do you want to do about Beto?

33:02.469 --> 33:03.768
Let's scoop him up.

33:03.770 --> 33:06.438
Just stash him someplace safe
till we find Del Toro.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.693
Let's go.

33:12.279 --> 33:14.412
Hey, kid. Where's Beto?

33:14.414 --> 33:16.982
- Uh, he's not here.
- When did he leave?

33:16.984 --> 33:18.383
I don't know. About an hour ago?

33:18.385 --> 33:20.619
Beto's still not answering his phone.

33:20.621 --> 33:22.287
All right, listen up.

33:22.289 --> 33:23.989
If he comes back in, he needs to call us.

33:23.991 --> 33:25.247
Yeah, sure.

33:25.249 --> 33:27.222
Yo, when he left, did he leave alone?

33:27.224 --> 33:29.761
Uh, no, Mr. Del Toro
came and picked him up.

33:30.116 --> 33:31.329
Oh, jeez.

33:31.331 --> 33:33.266
Kim, get an emergency order
and ping Beto's phone.

33:33.268 --> 33:34.364
On it.

33:34.366 --> 33:35.471
What kind of car were they driving?

33:35.473 --> 33:38.603
- Um, a white BMW.
- 5021 Frank,

33:38.605 --> 33:40.505
this is Detective Dawson of Intelligence.

33:40.507 --> 33:42.707
Put out a Flash Message
and lodge an All Call Alert

33:42.709 --> 33:45.310
on Alex Del Toro
driving a white BMW sedan.

33:45.312 --> 33:47.512
This is a life and death priority matter.

33:55.698 --> 33:57.331
Last consecutive ping from Beto's phone

33:57.333 --> 33:58.802
came from this area 20 minutes ago.

33:58.804 --> 34:01.335
Looks like Del Toro's gonna
smuggle himself out of town.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.337
Hey, uh...

34:06.142 --> 34:07.445
I got something.

34:09.563 --> 34:11.533
Hey, two o'clock. White BMW.

34:14.141 --> 34:16.109
Chicago PD!

34:20.188 --> 34:21.293
Clear.

34:23.197 --> 34:24.588
It's Beto.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.562
He's gone.

34:28.563 --> 34:30.539
Looks like Del Toro's a man of his word.

34:33.061 --> 34:34.097
All right, we've got to fan out.

34:34.099 --> 34:35.190
Hailey, tell the port supervisor

34:35.193 --> 34:36.704
- don't let anything out.
- On it.

34:36.706 --> 34:37.851
Let's go!

34:38.833 --> 34:40.061
Hey!

34:40.835 --> 34:42.802
Chicago PD.

34:42.804 --> 34:44.024
You see this guy?

34:45.841 --> 34:46.985
Nah, I haven't seen him.

34:49.476 --> 34:50.739
Antonio.

34:53.848 --> 34:55.118
Red flannel.

34:57.251 --> 34:59.998
Alex Del Toro! Chicago PD!

35:03.191 --> 35:06.326
Hold up! Hold up!

35:06.328 --> 35:08.061
Go!

35:34.688 --> 35:36.956
5021 Ida. Shots fired at the police.

35:36.958 --> 35:39.192
<i>Copy that, 5021 Ida.</i>

36:18.165 --> 36:19.566
There's nowhere to run!

36:32.880 --> 36:35.281
Go ahead. Arrest me.

36:50.731 --> 36:53.066
You killed his brother,
you son of a bitch.

36:56.371 --> 36:58.158
You really thought
you'd get away with it?

37:05.046 --> 37:06.879
Whoa, whoa. Hey! Antonio!

37:08.950 --> 37:10.483
Whoa, Antonio!

37:10.485 --> 37:12.085
Yo, just put the cuffs on him, brother.

37:14.238 --> 37:15.967
Antonio!

37:17.659 --> 37:19.826
Hey, listen, man, he's not worth it!

37:29.137 --> 37:30.803
You don't deserve this.

37:34.976 --> 37:36.497
Let's go.

37:43.084 --> 37:45.485
When we sent out the patrol
units to grab Del Toro,

37:45.487 --> 37:46.853
his wife tipped him off.

37:46.855 --> 37:48.621
That's how he knew Carlos flipped.

37:48.623 --> 37:50.539
Hey, man, if Carlos had confessed

37:50.541 --> 37:52.112
when we had Del Toro in custody,

37:52.114 --> 37:53.417
his brother would still be alive.

37:53.419 --> 37:54.652
This is not on you. You know that, right?

37:54.654 --> 37:55.947
Yeah, I know.

37:55.949 --> 37:57.422
Hey, listen. Look, look.

37:57.424 --> 37:59.094
I've got some good news for you.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.634
I just got off the phone with Voight.

38:01.636 --> 38:04.971
"The Tribune's" gonna publish
the story exposing Kelton.

38:05.308 --> 38:06.839
You're kidding.

38:07.227 --> 38:08.941
No. It's over.

38:21.022 --> 38:23.356
Congrats on the Del Toro bust.

38:23.358 --> 38:25.379
Must feel good finally
getting him off the street.

38:25.381 --> 38:26.621
Yeah, it does.

38:28.063 --> 38:30.730
- Hey, Kim.
- Yeah?

38:30.732 --> 38:32.598
That press conference has started.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.167
Oh, yeah?

38:34.169 --> 38:35.735
Kelton really dropping out?

38:35.737 --> 38:37.737
- It's what they say.
- Good.

38:37.739 --> 38:40.039
<i>Good evening. Thank you all for coming.</i>

38:40.041 --> 38:42.303
<i>I'm Deputy Superintendent Kate Brennan.</i>

38:42.877 --> 38:44.977
<i>I'm sure you've all heard
the disturbing rumors</i>

38:44.979 --> 38:47.547
<i>floating around the city
about how a serial killer</i>

38:47.549 --> 38:49.549
<i>was allowed to commit additional murders</i>

38:49.551 --> 38:52.051
<i>due to mishandling by the CPD.</i>

38:52.053 --> 38:54.023
There was indeed a cover-up.

38:55.657 --> 38:59.859
But Superintendent Kelton
had nothing to do with it.

39:01.315 --> 39:03.533
I am the one responsible.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.832
What's she doing?

39:05.834 --> 39:07.834
She's taking a bullet for Kelton.

39:07.836 --> 39:10.290
<i>I made an ill-advised decision</i>

39:10.839 --> 39:12.895
<i>and I will live with that mistake</i>

39:12.897 --> 39:14.502
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

39:14.917 --> 39:16.316
<i>I am deeply sorry</i>

39:16.578 --> 39:18.979
<i>and I take full responsibility.</i>

39:19.299 --> 39:22.886
I've handed in my resignation
to Superintendent Kelton.

39:23.585 --> 39:25.430
Effective immediately.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:41.622 --> 39:43.031
Kate.

39:48.943 --> 39:51.706
All this time, I thought
I had so many friends,

39:52.947 --> 39:56.185
and yet you are the only person
who comes to see me.

39:56.187 --> 39:57.462
Hmm.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.173
What happened?

40:03.664 --> 40:05.261
I got outflanked.

40:07.328 --> 40:09.057
All this time I was helping Kelton,

40:09.410 --> 40:11.276
crossing lines to protect him,

40:11.301 --> 40:14.936
he was keeping evidence against me.

40:19.774 --> 40:22.737
I was playing checkers.
He was playing chess.

40:24.452 --> 40:26.407
Why not take him down with you?

40:27.028 --> 40:28.828
He offered me a deal.

40:28.853 --> 40:30.486
I confess my sins.

40:30.511 --> 40:32.978
I pretend that I was the one
who wrote the email

40:33.003 --> 40:36.004
and he won't bring
official charges against me.

40:38.221 --> 40:40.338
Kate, I'm worried about you.

40:42.362 --> 40:45.631
Don't worry about me, Hank.
Worry about yourself.

40:47.401 --> 40:49.472
Kelton is coming for you.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.760
He's coming.
