Monroe: I'm guessing Miles
is with your mom.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.398
You're gonna go warn him
and I'm coming with you.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.430
Excuse me?

00:12.560 --> 00:14.915
- Your family could use my help.
- What?

00:14.960 --> 00:16.075
What do they want with my mom?

00:16.200 --> 00:18.476
Rachel, this is Ed Truman,
US government.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.039
They took out half
of Titus's guys.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.599
I'm just glad
we got here when we did.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.432
Rachel: I'm sorry, but you
come out of nowhere,

00:23.480 --> 00:25.118
you call yourself
United States.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.315
I'm curious.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.470
I'm a Patriot, Rachel.

00:27.560 --> 00:30.791
Can't have you strolling around
telling everybody our secrets.

for your mother.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.270
We'll keep you close.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.270
What about my son?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.271
Well, we have a very
special plan for him,

a problem with it.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.756
Well, this is an occupation.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.150

are you going?

to find my mom.

already have her.

have the town.

No accelerant.

like a match.

02:36.680 --> 02:40.958
So, how well
did we bury Ken?

02:41.040 --> 02:43.429
I scrubbed the blood,
wiped down the scene.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.590
I think I covered it.

Were you at a rail road
or something last night?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.917
Well, it's kind
of a long story.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.189
You might want
to take a seat.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.429
You jumped
a chain-link fence,

03:27.560 --> 03:29.358
and two guys
had guns on you,

03:29.440 --> 03:31.113
and then they
burst into flame.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.200
How do you know that?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.549
Because I saw it.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.599
Saw it?

03:53.640 --> 03:54.710
Aaron, you were
nowhere near it.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.598
I saw it...

03:56.640 --> 03:58.836
and I'm pretty
sure I did it.

are you talking about?

04:03.800 --> 04:05.837

it's the nanotech?

But it would have to network
images into your head.

to obey orders.

They're not designed
for anything close to that.

the fact that it happened.

Back when Texas and the Monroe
Republic were squabbling,

to kill him.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.958
Still... no, thank you.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.309
I'm the only applicant.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.556
Can I be honest?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.673
You smell like liquor.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.989
That's a nonstarter.

15:04.080 --> 15:05.400
Okay, yes,
you're right.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.629
I won't drink...

15:06.720 --> 15:07.676
at work.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.394
Just as important...

15:10.480 --> 15:12.994
in the last 2O minutes,
you haven't smiled once.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.634
Frankly, you've
got kind of a sad,

15:15.680 --> 15:17.079
unmarried uncle
thing going on,

15:17.160 --> 15:20.073
and I think
you might scare the kids.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.791
Look,
you don't know me.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.831
I get it.

15:26.880 --> 15:32.319
But I haven't had a lot to
smile about in the last month,

15:32.360 --> 15:38.231
and if I don't
do something...

15:38.320 --> 15:39.390
I'm gonna lose it.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.840
I mean, not in
the front of the kids,

15:42.920 --> 15:43.910
'cause that
would be very...

15:44.000 --> 15:45.035
I'm very professional.

15:51.520 --> 15:52.555
Please.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.309
I need a job.
I need this job.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.112
Do you think you
could learn to smile?

16:54.640 --> 16:57.280
Miles: You know, she really
missed you, Charlie.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.510
Just saying, when
you see her again,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.796
go easy
on her, okay?

17:01.880 --> 17:03.917
Yeah, I'll try
to play nice.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.115
Promise.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.115
Okay, so now you need
to promise me to not,

17:08.200 --> 17:10.999
you know,
explode or go crazy.

17:11.079 --> 17:13.310
Wait, huh?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.470
No.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.550
That's never a good...

17:18.640 --> 17:19.710
Miles.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.310
What did you do to her?

17:33.400 --> 17:35.471
Whoa, whoa, nothing.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.716
I know you,
you son of a bitch.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.359
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't touch her.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.795
Hey, hey, I wouldn't
let him touch me.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.993
I saved her life.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.830
You brought
him here?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.349
Charlie, let's go.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.550
Miles...

18:07.640 --> 18:08.675
<i>New.!</i>

18:08.720 --> 18:11.394
Monroe: Hey, I walked halfway
down the map to help you.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.356
Miles: Sorry?

18:13.520 --> 18:15.750
That's right.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.160
With these US guys.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.839
By the looks of it,
you're gonna need it.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.720
Oh. You're here to help me?

18:28.280 --> 18:30.590
I don't want
your help, Bass.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.750
I should kill you.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.837
That's right.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.316
But you're never quite able
to pull the trigger yourself.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.350
Right?

18:41.560 --> 18:43.392
Come on, Miles.

18:45.160 --> 18:49.199
Look at yourself,
you handy-capable schmuck.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.151
You can't do this alone.
You need me.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.636
You want to help me?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.472
Go away.

19:00.080 --> 19:04.438
They nuked
our city, Miles.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.717
They burned it.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.915
They're trying
to pin it on me.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.951
I want payback.

19:12.520 --> 19:15.114
Best way to get it
is you and me...

19:15.200 --> 19:16.599
together.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.829
You know it.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.834
I'm asking...

19:27.760 --> 19:29.831
I'm asking
for a truce.

19:42.720 --> 19:45.678
If they're after my morn,
why don't we just grab her and go?

19:45.760 --> 19:46.909
Where?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.277
Plastic sons of bitches
are everywhere.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.911
This is as good a place
as any to make a stand.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.359
Miles, you're talking
about starting a war.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.670
Damn straight.
That's smart.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.990
We get the Texans
to fight the Patriots for us.

20:01.280 --> 20:02.918
You know, it's kind of like
that thing in Ann Arbor.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.280
What happened
in Ann Arbor?

20:04.360 --> 20:05.350
Drop it.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.878
Qkay, sorry.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.476
Miles: John Fry
is leaving first thing.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.471
I'm supposed to have
proof for him by tonight.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.597
Don't worry.
We'll get you some proof.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.671
Rachel.
(PANTING)

20:33.760 --> 20:35.512
Hey, Cyn.
Have you seen Miles?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.920
No.
Have you seen Aaron?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.434
He's gone.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.629
Gone?
What do you mean?

20:39.680 --> 20:41.239
I mean he packed
and he left.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.038
God knows where.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.236
Okay, uh, let me
check in with Miles.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.231
- I'll have to find...
- Rachel.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.834
You have
to find him, okay?

20:49.920 --> 20:53.231
Aaron told me about
your insane little machines.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.310
Okay?

20:55.320 --> 20:57.675
Something
is happening to him.

20:57.720 --> 20:58.835
He's seeing things.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.837
He's scared,
and now he's out there.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.553
Okay, okay.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.711
How far could
he have gone?

21:04.800 --> 21:05.995
We'll split up.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.198
I'll meet back at your house
in three hours.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.560
<i>'</i> Okay?
<i>'</i> Okay_

21:10.640 --> 21:12.233
It's gonna be okay.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.954
I got you something.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.196
What? Why?

21:26.240 --> 21:28.117
Just something
to help in class.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.390
I don't get it.

21:43.480 --> 21:44.470
You needed one.

21:46.560 --> 21:48.551
It's a smile,
dumb-ass.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.190
(CHUCKLES)
That is the stupidest thing

21:53.240 --> 21:55.880
I have seen in a really,
really long time.

21:55.920 --> 21:56.876
Except you're smiling.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.917
Well, yeah because
you're stupid, though.

21:58.960 --> 21:59.995
Whatever works.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.678
(MAN CLEARS THROAT)

22:04.240 --> 22:05.833
What?

22:05.920 --> 22:07.513
- Carl.
- What's funny?

22:07.560 --> 22:11.110
Aaron,
this is my husband Carl.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.271
- Hey.
- Ah...

22:13.400 --> 22:15.755
- You're the new teacher?
- Yeah.

22:15.800 --> 22:17.473
And you're funny?

22:19.080 --> 22:20.036
So what's the joke?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.434
I like jokes.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.797
It's just...
the teeth.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.314
It's stupid.

22:27.760 --> 22:28.750
And why is that funny?

22:28.960 --> 22:29.791
How's that a joke?

22:36.200 --> 22:38.350
Is it a private joke, Aaron?

22:38.440 --> 22:39.839
No, Carl.

22:39.960 --> 22:40.995
No, of course not.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.833
(LAUGHING)

22:46.960 --> 22:47.950
I'm just messing with you.

22:48.040 --> 22:48.950
See?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.792
Now that's a joke.

22:52.280 --> 22:53.475
Nice meeting you, teach.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.393
Miles: Well, it was filled
with prisoners yesterday.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.596
Oh, you knew they were
gonna scrub the scene.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.789
What'd you expect?

23:11.840 --> 23:13.877
I don't know.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.600
A lead, a thread,
anything but Jack squat.

23:16.640 --> 23:18.472
Buck up, pal.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.272
We'll get Fry his proof.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.995
What is that?

23:26.040 --> 23:27.394
What?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.630
You're practically
skipping.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.909
You having fun?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.877
(CHUCKLING)
What?

23:32.960 --> 23:36.157
Do you think I want
to be here with you?

Don't flatter yourself.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.833
Let's be clear.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.156
Maybe you are useful,

23:48.280 --> 23:50.510
but this is not Butch
and Sundance.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.240
You're nothing
but a dark pit

23:53.320 --> 23:55.709
that I spent too many years
trying to crawl out of.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.474
Last thing I'm gonna let
you do is pull me back in.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.631
Uh-huh.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.194
Charlie: It's not much, but I found
some wagon treads.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.716
Well, it's better
than nothing.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.035
See where they lead.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.757
That son of a bitch again.

He's like
a bad penny.

Hi there.

Man: You coming out
of the Savannah camp?

25:00.880 --> 25:02.791
We are.
You en route?

25:02.880 --> 25:04.393
Yes, ma'am.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.949
Secretary Allenford,
Acting Command.

25:07.960 --> 25:08.870
I know.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.075

to meet you.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.150
Excuse me?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.469
How'd you find me?

25:51.520 --> 25:54.319
You told me you come here
sometimes to think.

25:54.400 --> 25:55.356
I did?

25:55.440 --> 25:56.430
Yeah.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.359
This reminds me
of the old days

25:59.440 --> 26:00.953
when I had three
of these stupid things.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.560
Yeah.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.314
Cynthia's worried,
and you need to come home.

26:06.400 --> 26:10.473
Tell her I'm sorry,
but I don't think I'm coming back.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.511
I know you're upset.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.159
Upset?

26:16.240 --> 26:18.436
Upset doesn't touch it.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.472
Rachel, I killed
those guys by thinking it.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.669
You don't know that.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.438
Yeah, I really do.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.154
They were gonna
shoot Miles...

26:27.240 --> 26:29.993
and then I felt
this flash of anger,

26:30.040 --> 26:34.398
and then
they caught fire.

26:34.480 --> 26:37.677
And I can't take
any more of this.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.194
What if someone else
gets hurt?

26:39.240 --> 26:41.311
They won't.

26:41.360 --> 26:45.672
Even if this is possible,
and I'm not...

26:45.760 --> 26:48.513
I'm not saying
that it is,

26:48.560 --> 26:49.994
you saved Miles.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.350
You don't understand.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.240
This isn't the first time
this has happened.

27:04.640 --> 27:06.631
(CAR CREAKING)

Aaron?

27:21.800 --> 27:22.710
What the hell
are you doing?

27:22.800 --> 27:24.234
Huh, teach?

27:24.280 --> 27:25.714
Nothing.
I didn't see anything.

27:25.760 --> 27:27.239
- Were you watching?
- No.

27:27.320 --> 27:28.833
What, are you some
kind of pervert?

27:28.880 --> 27:31.349
No, no, no, please.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.834
Is that how you get your rocks off?
Huh, is that it?

27:32.920 --> 27:34.797
No.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.955
Carl, leave him alone.

27:36.040 --> 27:40.159
You say one word to Cynthia,
and I'll kill you.

27:40.240 --> 27:41.230
You understand?

27:41.280 --> 27:43.669
I understand.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.114
Good.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.830
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

28:32.360 --> 28:33.919
Aaron: I tried to get them out,

28:33.960 --> 28:35.394
but I couldn't.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.994
Cynthia thinks...

28:38.080 --> 28:39.912
the whole town
thinks...

28:39.960 --> 28:42.520
that the lantern
started that fire.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.069
And I thought
so too until now.

28:46.680 --> 28:49.194
Now I know it was me.

28:49.280 --> 28:55.231
Whatever this is,
clearly I can't control it.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.597
What if I do something
like that to Cynthia?

28:58.640 --> 29:00.233
You won't.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.310
You don't know that.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.680
I know you.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.672
It would be better
for everyone if I left.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.953
No. No, no.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.196
Cynthia needs you.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.715
I need you.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.518
We'll figure this out.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.956
We'll...
I don't know how.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.753
But you...

29:24.840 --> 29:25.989
You have
to come home.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.434
You, you...

Please.

29:42.920 --> 29:46.800

Easy.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.871
I think
we're okay now.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.638
But that bullet's
got to come out.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.037
Wait.

29:54.120 --> 29:58.557
This would be a very
bad time not to trust me.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.193
Blouse too.

30:22.080 --> 30:25.277
So, you're gonna tell me
what that was back there?

30:29.200 --> 30:33.034
I wrote a letter to...
to High Command.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.549
A letter?
Saying what?

30:35.600 --> 30:39.434
Those wagons
back in Savannah,

30:39.520 --> 30:43.718
they were only letting on
the healthy and the young...

30:43.760 --> 30:46.274
and they weren't
going to a new camp.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.794
Then where?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.118
A reprogramming center.

30:58.480 --> 31:04.112
Which, I assume,
is as cheery as it sounds.

31:08.600 --> 31:11.956
You can't imagine
any place worse.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.599
It's behavioral
conditioning.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.758
Steady diets
of LSD, PCP.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.711
And so I protested.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.119
Apparently this
was their answer.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.033
They don't take
criticism well.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.874
(ALLENFORD GRUNTS IN PAIN)

31:33.280 --> 31:35.840
Well...

31:35.920 --> 31:39.276
looks like I hitched my star
to the wrong wagon.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.275
Good luck, lady.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.269
What?

31:45.320 --> 31:46.594
You can't
leave me here.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.392
They're trying
to kill you.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.030
I'm looking to be
a Patriot, not a fugitive.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.991
MY apologies.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.678
It's your son.

32:06.680 --> 32:07.636
What about him?

32:07.680 --> 32:09.432
They've got him...

32:09.520 --> 32:11.511
at the same
reprogramming center.

32:19.880 --> 32:24.158
Where is it?

32:25.480 --> 32:28.916
I'll take you there
if you get me out of here.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.037
(GRUNTING)

32:57.840 --> 33:00.275
Well, I hate
to break it to you, pal...

33:00.360 --> 33:02.715
but this trail
is going nowhere.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.994
Well, I guess it is
Butch and Sundance.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.479
Shut up.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.278
How many you think?
Seven? Eight?

33:34.160 --> 33:35.673
Yeah.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.676
What do we do?
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

33:39.760 --> 33:41.273
You remember South Bend?

33:42.280 --> 33:43.509
Yeah, that'll work.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.511
What? You guys are
just saying cities.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.510
You sure you're
up for this?

33:46.600 --> 33:47.590
Just worry
about yourself.

33:48.880 --> 33:49.790
Heads up.

33:50.960 --> 33:51.916
Cover us.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.916
Wait!

33:52.960 --> 33:53.950
- Now.
- What?

33:54.960 --> 33:55.950
Damn it.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.997
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

35:24.280 --> 35:25.918
Oh!

35:26.000 --> 35:26.910
YOU?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.150
I owe you for this.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.751
(MAN GROANING)

35:35.480 --> 35:36.709
Help me get him up.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.114
What are you doing?

35:38.200 --> 35:39.873
He worked for Titus.
Works for the Patriots.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.395
We get him to talk,
he's our proof.

35:44.600 --> 35:45.829
All right.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.314
Guess it all worked out.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.516
Rachel: You know, Cynthia
is gonna kill you for leaving.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.397
I'm aware.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.750
Aaron?

36:10.840 --> 36:12.433
Hey! Hey, Aaron.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.477
Hey, Aaron?

36:14.560 --> 36:16.631
Aaron, can
you hear me?

36:16.720 --> 36:17.710
Aaron?

36:18.840 --> 36:19.750
Aaron.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.999
(GASPING)

36:28.640 --> 36:30.756
I saw something.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.751
What did you see?

37:09.320 --> 37:11.231
What?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.311
Well, you got to admit,
back there, that was...

37:13.360 --> 37:16.113
that was
kind of fun.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.195
Right?

37:19.560 --> 37:21.073
(DOOR OPENS)

37:28.400 --> 37:29.629
What the hell
is going on?

37:31.400 --> 37:32.310
Rachel.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.834
Oh, God.

37:33.880 --> 37:35.553
All right, listen.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.517
Hold on, Rachel.
Hold on. Hold on.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.352
Rachel, hold on!

37:39.440 --> 37:40.669
Get out
of my way, Miles.

37:40.720 --> 37:41.949
We don't have
time for this.

37:42.000 --> 37:42.956
Get out of my way.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.115
Fry is gonna be
here any minute.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.116
I'm supposed
to be alone.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.673
Why are you
protecting him?

37:46.720 --> 37:47.915
Because
he's helping us.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.197
Charlie?

37:52.240 --> 37:54.038
And because
I brought him.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.156
Perfect.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.669
Thank you, Charlie.
That's very helpful.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.233
You brought
him here?

38:04.440 --> 38:05.874
And why would
you do that?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.030
Look.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.110
You can shoot
each other later.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.790
Right now,
just get out of sight.

38:21.880 --> 38:22.870
Bass?

38:24.440 --> 38:25.874
Over there.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.031
You three, upstairs.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.874
I'm begging you.
Just get upstairs, please.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.792
So, Monroe?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.520
That's...
that's quite a twist.

38:52.600 --> 38:53.590
Get upstairs!

39:01.400 --> 39:04.233
I am so happy
to see you.

39:04.320 --> 39:06.311
I mean, in person.

39:06.400 --> 39:09.438
Just... glad you're here.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.635
How you been?

I've been better,
Charlie.

Rachel...

39:24.680 --> 39:26.353
Look,
I understand, okay?

39:26.440 --> 39:27.794
When I first saw him,
I tried to kill him...

39:27.840 --> 39:32.232
But you didn't
because...

39:32.280 --> 39:35.159
he wants to help
'cause he's a saint.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.150
Would you let
me explain?

39:36.240 --> 39:37.275
And you believed him.

39:37.320 --> 39:39.038
Are you really
that stupid?

39:42.240 --> 39:44.277
For coming back here?
Yeah, I think I am.

What do you got?

40:17.800 --> 40:19.074
Back here.

are these guys?

your proof?

Well, trust me, John.

41:04.640 --> 41:07.553
If he could talk,
you'd be blown away.

Well, I don't know what
you want me to do, Miles.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.471
Now, I can go
back to Carver

41:16.560 --> 41:19.029
and tell him
I don't like these Patriots,

41:19.120 --> 41:21.873
but he's just gonna go ahead
and sign the treaty anyway.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.718

start a war.

come up with...

you thinking?

What is that?

All we got to do now
is frame the Patriots for this.

have your war.
