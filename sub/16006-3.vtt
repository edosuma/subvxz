WEBVTT

00:02.012 --> 00:04.083
Mrs Vasilich, we have a warrant for
your arrest,

00:04.083 --> 00:06.028
and we have a search warrant.

00:06.044 --> 00:08.147
This is where Blakely's car was
found.

00:08.148 --> 00:10.036
They probably carried the body
down this way.

00:10.125 --> 00:11.356
Andy, I really was impressed.

00:11.415 --> 00:14.375
On the balance of probabilities,
I'd say you could be right.

00:14.391 --> 00:17.943
All the defence has to do is create
reasonable doubt and we're shot.

00:18.023 --> 00:19.183
You won't need these, I guess.

00:19.255 --> 00:21.455
We need a body, Jack.
That's what we need.

00:21.525 --> 00:23.513
You really want to go
behind the DPP's back?

00:23.529 --> 00:25.463
Bypass them altogether
and run your own trial?

00:25.545 --> 00:27.761
Yes. Would you be interested
in running it for us?

00:27.770 --> 00:31.494
Tony, I'm going to sign this
ex-officio indictment in 24 hours

00:31.543 --> 00:36.087
unless the DPP agree to prosecute
Dianne Vasilich and her son for murder.

00:36.179 --> 00:39.159
We have to go for it.
Tony, we're not ready.

00:39.175 --> 00:43.155
We have to win it and the person
most likely to win is...

00:44.845 --> 00:46.546
Your evidence
will ensure a conviction.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.543
Owen's a little different from
Janet, but he's a fine advocate.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.298
You're in good hands, I promise.

00:51.299 --> 00:55.223
Two weeks ago you paid off your
mortgage with $100,000 in cash.

00:55.239 --> 00:58.227
Want to tell me where that came from?
Who do you really want to upset?

00:58.243 --> 01:00.301
If it's us, I'll have you declared
a hostile witness

01:00.302 --> 01:01.581
and question all your finances.

01:01.656 --> 01:03.656
If it's them, we'll look into
immediate relocation

01:03.729 --> 01:05.223
for you and your son.

01:42.375 --> 01:44.399
As we approached
the court building,

01:44.411 --> 01:47.335
I saw Zebina standing there, waiting.

01:51.323 --> 01:54.403
Owen, he saw Geoff Hadley
so he stepped away

01:55.319 --> 01:59.363
and, well, I went over to Zebina
by myself.

02:01.347 --> 02:03.339
We started chatting...

02:04.387 --> 02:08.335
..we started to move away
towards the court...

02:09.399 --> 02:11.399
..and that's when I heard the
motorbike.

02:13.343 --> 02:14.395
Take your time.

02:16.395 --> 02:18.391
Zebina looked up too.

02:18.407 --> 02:21.411
Then I saw the man on the back
of the bike pull out a gun.

02:22.327 --> 02:28.339
There was a bang and I felt something
hit me, knock me down.

02:28.351 --> 02:30.367
But it wasn't a bullet.

02:30.379 --> 02:32.323
It was Zebina.

02:37.387 --> 02:41.387
She was on me, on top of me.

02:41.399 --> 02:45.359
Heavy. Not moving.

02:59.363 --> 03:01.391
Erin.

03:01.403 --> 03:03.371
You alright?

03:03.383 --> 03:05.391
You didn't have to stay.

03:05.407 --> 03:07.391
I wasn't gonna walk away
and leave you here.

03:07.407 --> 03:10.367
I'm fine.
Really?

03:10.383 --> 03:13.375
I'm not fine and I was standing
50 metres away from the whole thing.

03:14.375 --> 03:16.391
How'd you go in there?
Was that OK?

03:16.403 --> 03:18.343
Mm-hm.

03:18.359 --> 03:20.367
Hey, listen, did you get
a good look at the riders?

03:20.379 --> 03:23.403
Owen, please. Not now.

03:25.383 --> 03:27.411
Thank God you're here.

03:29.387 --> 03:32.323
OK, so I brought you
two different outfits.

03:32.339 --> 03:34.407
I hope they're OK.
Yeah, they'll be fine. Thank you.

03:35.319 --> 03:36.343
Hey, Terry?

03:36.359 --> 03:38.395
Bloody hell, this was the girl you
were calling me about, wasn't it?

03:38.411 --> 03:40.375
Yeah.
What a fuckin' mess.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.387
Is it on camera? Can you ID them?

03:42.403 --> 03:45.351
All we've got at the moment
is a victim,

03:45.363 --> 03:47.371
pronounced dead at the scene,

03:47.391 --> 03:50.411
cause of death, severe trauma to
the head from a high-powered firearm.

03:51.327 --> 03:53.359
We are currently...
Terry, don't press release me.

03:53.375 --> 03:56.343
Those murdering shitheads
left a little kid without a mother.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.359
And you without a witness.
Is it on camera?

03:58.375 --> 04:00.363
I just want to know
if we'll be able to get 'em.

04:00.379 --> 04:03.315
Well, because of all the security
at the court complex,

04:03.331 --> 04:07.319
this is probably
the most filmed drive-by in history.

04:07.335 --> 04:10.331
We've got the gun, bike,
make, model, rego.

04:10.343 --> 04:12.323
Have a look.

04:13.371 --> 04:15.411
Unfortunately, they're wearing
full-face helmets

04:16.322 --> 04:18.346
so we can't ID them.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.359
You alright?
Yep.

04:27.371 --> 04:29.411
Yep. Check this out.

04:30.327 --> 04:33.319
The shooter's hand.
Is that a tattoo?

04:33.331 --> 04:34.323
Mmm.

04:34.339 --> 04:37.319
It's hard to tell from the photo,
but your young solicitor friend

04:37.335 --> 04:39.407
has got a sharp set of eyes
and drew this.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.339
Did you run it?
Yep. Got a match.

04:42.351 --> 04:43.391
One Edward Collard.

04:43.407 --> 04:47.351
A few minor convictions,
assault, auto theft.

04:47.367 --> 04:51.335
Interestingly, he's a nom in the
same bikie gang as your defendant.

04:52.351 --> 04:54.395
Nice one.
Assassinations now?

04:54.407 --> 04:56.391
I might as well move to Mexico.

04:56.407 --> 04:59.351
The food's better, the booze is
cheaper and the women are Mexican,

04:59.367 --> 05:01.395
which is no small selling point,
let me tell you.

05:01.407 --> 05:03.343
Yeah, I can see the attraction.

05:03.363 --> 05:06.351
I've had the Attorney-General on
the phone for the best part of an hour.

05:06.367 --> 05:09.339
Not happy?
The word 'berserk' comes to mind.

05:09.355 --> 05:12.411
But my chances of calming her
would be significantly improved

05:13.327 --> 05:15.407
if there was still a prospect
of running the Simpson case.

05:16.323 --> 05:19.327
Well, it's been adjourned till next
Friday, which is just a formality.

05:19.343 --> 05:21.371
Without our key witness,
it's a certain nolle.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.375
Perhaps I committed sins
in a previous life

05:23.387 --> 05:25.367
for which I am now atoning.

05:25.383 --> 05:28.375
Tony. The shooting. They're gonna
make an arrest very soon.

05:28.391 --> 05:30.347
A guy in the same bikie gang as
Simpson.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.335
Are you lobbying for the brief
already?

05:32.347 --> 05:34.343
No. I'm saying I feel responsible.

05:34.359 --> 05:37.403
I think of that woman's son.
I look at Erin, outside.

05:37.619 --> 05:40.737
Have you seen her?
Not yet. Poor kid.

05:40.793 --> 05:42.363
Yeah, she's a fuckin' mess.

05:42.379 --> 05:45.315
And everybody else around here's
pretty shaken up too.

05:45.327 --> 05:46.351
I know.

05:46.367 --> 05:48.383
You need someone
who's gonna take these pricks on,

05:48.399 --> 05:51.367
who'll walk over there
despite everything that's happened,

05:51.383 --> 05:52.943
walk into court and tear 'em to
pieces.

05:53.037 --> 05:55.391
Now, maybe there's a dozen other
crowns who'd do that,

05:55.403 --> 05:57.387
I'm just saying I'm fine with it.

05:59.339 --> 06:01.335
I hear you've applied for silk.

06:01.347 --> 06:03.035
It's no secret.

06:03.037 --> 06:04.387
And winning a sensational case

06:04.403 --> 06:07.355
with a high media profile
wouldn't hurt that cause...

06:07.371 --> 06:10.335
Maybe. I hadn't thought of that.
Ah.

06:10.351 --> 06:13.323
Yes, I'd love a chance
to finish what I started.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.383
But I also think
this could work for both of us.

06:25.323 --> 06:27.379
I had to give my clothes to
forensics

06:27.395 --> 06:30.351
so Lina brought in
some clean gear for me

06:30.367 --> 06:35.383
and I don't think the skirt
works with the shirt.

06:35.399 --> 06:41.335
No, it doesn't.
What was she thinking?

07:11.323 --> 07:14.383
You know, if you feel
you want to talk to someone,

07:14.399 --> 07:16.375
a professional,
we can arrange that.

07:16.387 --> 07:18.395
I spent my whole afternoon talking.

07:18.411 --> 07:22.379
I don't want to think about it
anymore.

07:26.407 --> 07:30.387
Oh, you can get that.
It's just Ash. I'll call her back.

07:36.343 --> 07:40.411
When I was giving my statement,
I was on autopilot.

07:41.327 --> 07:44.347
I just answered the questions,
did what I was told.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.379
I didn't even think about
what I was saying.

07:46.395 --> 07:49.355
Doing what we do,
it's easy to forget how hard it is

07:49.371 --> 07:52.391
for witnesses having to relive it
all.

07:52.407 --> 07:55.331
As long as you feel you did your
best.

07:55.347 --> 07:59.403
The last person who did her best
was gunned down in front of me.

08:16.343 --> 08:19.343
Janet, call me, please.

08:28.339 --> 08:29.371
What happened?

08:29.387 --> 08:31.391
Is he OK?
It's OK. He's fine.

08:31.407 --> 08:34.347
Where is he?
The swing clipped his head.

08:34.363 --> 08:36.399
There's no sign of concussion,
but it left a nasty gash.

08:37.315 --> 08:40.315
It's deep, so they've put him under
a light general...

08:40.327 --> 08:41.342
General anaesthetic!

08:41.359 --> 08:43.335
The plastic surgeon said
it's the only way

08:43.351 --> 08:45.339
to keep a toddler
still enough for stitches.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.359
I'm...

08:56.371 --> 08:58.363
I'm so sorry I missed your calls.

08:58.379 --> 09:01.391
I was talking to Erin and I...
How is she?

09:01.407 --> 09:05.315
Not good.
It's been all over the telly.

09:05.331 --> 09:08.355
They didn't identify her, did they?
I wouldn't really know.

09:08.371 --> 09:10.351
I've had other things to think
about.

09:10.367 --> 09:14.399
I'm sorry.
Don't be. It's my fault.

09:15.315 --> 09:17.331
I was reading an email on my
phone...

09:17.343 --> 09:19.323
You can't watch them every second.

09:19.339 --> 09:21.351
I knew I wasn't paying
proper attention.

09:21.367 --> 09:23.359
I've been off with the fairies
all day.

09:26.403 --> 09:30.395
St Bart's called.
Sounding me out about a position.

09:30.411 --> 09:34.127
Head of the senior school.
What?

09:34.179 --> 09:35.311
Why didn't you tell me this?

09:35.323 --> 09:36.639
I knew I wasn't going to take it

09:36.694 --> 09:40.738
so I didn't see any point in
mentioning it.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.809
But they wrote again this morning

09:43.865 --> 09:46.877
saying they really wanted me
and could I reconsider,

09:46.889 --> 09:48.917
and that was the email.

09:49.178 --> 09:52.130
I must have read that bloody thing
about ten times,

09:52.146 --> 09:56.142
this pathetic little lifeline
to the real world.

09:56.158 --> 09:59.050
I was reading it again
when Liam ran in front of the swing.

09:59.102 --> 10:01.130
It's not your fault.

10:03.933 --> 10:06.001
I'm sorry.
Shh.

10:12.933 --> 10:17.001
Got him. Edward Collard,
he of the spider tattoo, and...

10:17.017 --> 10:19.009
Toby Franzen.
Toby Franzen.

10:19.925 --> 10:21.937
We've been after that piece of shit
for years.

10:21.953 --> 10:23.941
Sergeant at Arms now?
Yeah.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.997
And the very one who sponsored our
mate Collard

10:26.009 --> 10:28.009
as a nominee in the bike club.

10:28.925 --> 10:30.929
Well, unless Franzen's
gone soft in his old age,

10:30.945 --> 10:32.013
I don't imagine
you got much out of him.

10:32.929 --> 10:37.021
Hasn't said a word.
But luckily for us, Collard has.

10:39.961 --> 10:41.985
You seen that tattoo anywhere
before?

10:41.997 --> 10:44.949
Oh, I seen it every day, eh.

10:44.965 --> 10:47.941
Where would that be?
Well, it's not on me bum.

10:49.965 --> 10:53.021
One of our witnesses saw that tattoo
on the back of the shooter's hand.

10:54.949 --> 10:57.009
Ah, which witness is that?

10:57.925 --> 10:58.985
And we've recovered the gun
you dumped

10:59.001 --> 11:00.961
about four blocks away
from the court.

11:00.977 --> 11:03.933
Not me.
Got your prints on it, Edward.

11:05.981 --> 11:08.013
I'd like you to take a look
at this photo

11:08.929 --> 11:11.949
from the CCTV TV footage
outside the court.

11:11.965 --> 11:14.925
We've got your bike,
we can identify you as the shooter,

11:14.941 --> 11:18.001
we've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

11:18.017 --> 11:20.969
Son, I don't know if you know
how much trouble you're in.

11:20.985 --> 11:23.981
I mean, this is one of the worst
killings in the state's history.

11:23.997 --> 11:26.989
The way I see it, you're going to
be doing life without parole

11:27.005 --> 11:31.937
at Goulburn Supermax with Ivan Milat
till the day you die.

11:31.953 --> 11:34.993
Unless, of course,
you start to help us out.

11:39.957 --> 11:43.925
Who's that?
Could be... could be Toby.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.953
Toby Franzen, is it? The rider?

11:45.969 --> 11:49.005
Yeah, well... yeah, I mean,
it looks like him, doesn't it?

11:50.953 --> 11:52.969
Is that you, is it?

11:52.981 --> 11:54.973
I mean, you did, didn't you?

11:54.985 --> 11:57.997
You know, pulled the trigger.

11:59.005 --> 12:00.953
I was just, you know...

12:00.965 --> 12:02.961
You know, it wasn't my idea.

12:02.977 --> 12:05.005
Yeah.
Toby said that we had to stop her.

12:05.925 --> 12:09.005
So I was gonna get me tatts branded
off if I didn't, you know, do what...

12:10.017 --> 12:11.953
Nice work, mate.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.981
Nothing beats a good confession.

12:22.981 --> 12:24.017
Andy, yes, I agree.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.017
We have a compelling theory
that explains Dianne's movements.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.953
It explains everything.
It's a good hypothesis.

12:29.969 --> 12:31.965
But we still have three main
problems.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.662
We have no forensic evidence

12:33.663 --> 12:36.289
directly linking Dianne Vasilich
to Blakely's death,

12:36.388 --> 12:38.356
we've got a weak motive and no body.

12:39.372 --> 12:41.352
How do you think she killed him?
A gun?

12:41.368 --> 12:43.360
Unlikely.
We checked her friends and family.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.409
There's no-one with criminal
connections

12:45.425 --> 12:47.429
and certainly no-one
with access to firearms.

12:47.445 --> 12:50.025
She could've used a pen,
according to Jack Rizzoli.

12:50.026 --> 12:51.433
It's a hard sell for the jury,
though.

12:51.449 --> 12:54.393
They'd probably go for a knife,
an iron bar over the head.

12:54.409 --> 12:56.413
What about her son, Brian?
What about him?

12:56.429 --> 12:58.421
We discussed
whether you might reinterview.

12:58.433 --> 13:00.369
Put the new evidence to him.

13:00.385 --> 13:02.373
The paint fragments found
in Blakely's car.

13:02.389 --> 13:04.377
Use it to rattle his cage.
Rattle his cage?

13:04.393 --> 13:06.401
You've been watching too many
movies, Richard.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.417
We're presuming Brian was dragged
into this against his will, right?

13:09.433 --> 13:11.405
Went along with it
to protect his mother.

13:11.417 --> 13:13.377
That makes him a potential weak link.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.449
We've already been putting pressure
on him.

13:14.465 --> 13:16.457
Unfortunately
Brian's stuck to his story 100%.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.389
Fine, but I have to sell
a case concept to the jury

13:19.401 --> 13:21.389
and right now, I don't have enough.

13:21.405 --> 13:24.433
I walked you through every detail.
Except how she killed him.

13:24.449 --> 13:26.437
A middle-aged woman with no history
of violence

13:26.449 --> 13:28.425
against a big, tough copper

13:28.441 --> 13:31.401
and no forensic evidence to work
with, nothing!

13:31.413 --> 13:32.441
What am I meant to say?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.441
Ah, good news.

13:38.457 --> 13:40.457
Barry Seers
has changed his plea to guilty.

13:41.369 --> 13:42.401
Barry Seers?

13:42.417 --> 13:44.453
Defendant in the Port Macquarie
cocaine importation.

13:45.369 --> 13:47.445
His case was listed before
Blakely's, but with Seers pleading,

13:47.461 --> 13:50.449
you've just become
the next cab off the rank.

13:50.461 --> 13:52.421
So, uh, put your seatbelts on.

13:55.441 --> 13:58.397
I didn't even want this.
Now you're cutting my prep time?

13:58.409 --> 13:59.465
Hey, you're shooting the messenger.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.465
Well, you certainly
seem pleased about it.

14:02.377 --> 14:03.445
I gave it a positive spin.

14:03.461 --> 14:05.441
Part of my job description,
rallying the troops.

14:07.437 --> 14:10.373
You don't look rallied.
We can't win this, Tony.

14:10.389 --> 14:12.377
Yes, you can.
And what do you base that on?

14:12.393 --> 14:14.433
On the fact I have confidence
in you.

14:14.445 --> 14:18.401
No, strike that. I have faith.

14:18.413 --> 14:23.389
A deep, abiding faith in you.

14:24.389 --> 14:25.453
You're so full of shit.

14:26.369 --> 14:29.397
Look, this business has been
all over the news,

14:29.413 --> 14:32.373
generating a huge amount of sympathy
for Blakely and his kids.

14:32.389 --> 14:34.409
Getting it on sooner,
you can use that sympathy.

14:34.421 --> 14:35.457
Work the jury.

14:36.373 --> 14:39.393
And if this groundswell of public
support doesn't get me over the line?

14:39.405 --> 14:43.409
Losing is not an option, Janet.

14:45.461 --> 14:47.409
I have a brief for you.

14:47.425 --> 14:49.433
Tracey, I'm snowed under
with stuff right now...

14:49.445 --> 14:51.405
We're all snowed under.

14:51.421 --> 14:55.401
Wait, this isn't the...
The Zebina Petrakis murder, yes.

14:55.417 --> 14:57.457
Owen'll run it, but I just thought
he might need some help

14:58.369 --> 14:59.433
managing his key witness.

14:59.449 --> 15:02.397
And I also thought Erin
might appreciate it too.

15:02.409 --> 15:05.413
That's... that's very compassionate.

15:05.429 --> 15:08.389
Well, it just seemed appropriate,
I suppose.

15:08.401 --> 15:09.449
I know it isn't a sex crime,

15:09.465 --> 15:12.389
but I take it you'll find some room
in your schedule?

15:12.401 --> 15:14.425
Well... Yeah, of course.

15:35.417 --> 15:38.369
Hey. How you going?
OK.

15:38.381 --> 15:40.381
How are you feeling today?

15:40.393 --> 15:41.453
Yeah, alright.

15:42.369 --> 15:43.417
Tracey just told me
you're doing Petrakis.

15:43.433 --> 15:46.425
Well, y-y-yeah.
We thought it would be helpful...

15:46.437 --> 15:49.465
I know. It is. It helps.

15:50.381 --> 15:52.461
Just wanted to say, whenever
you've got any questions, just ask.

15:53.377 --> 15:55.449
Well, don't think you've got to wait
for a good time or anything.

15:55.461 --> 15:56.449
Mm.

15:56.465 --> 15:59.437
But don't stop what you're doing,
either. When it suits, really.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.923
What are you doing, anyway?

16:06.373 --> 16:08.373
How old does she look to you?

16:12.457 --> 16:17.449
Oh, God. Young. I don't know.

16:18.457 --> 16:21.385
Neither do I.

16:23.377 --> 16:25.437
So are you leaving soon, or...?

16:25.453 --> 16:29.397
Well, I've only got 34,000 more
images to examine, so...

16:29.409 --> 16:31.369
Sure, OK.

16:31.385 --> 16:35.377
Just thought it might be nice to have
some company heading home.

16:35.393 --> 16:39.413
Well, you know what? It's date
night. So I ought to head home.

16:39.429 --> 16:42.429
Date night.
I assume that's a euphemism.

16:42.441 --> 16:44.401
Correct.

16:44.417 --> 16:47.385
This is procreation, not recreation.
Mm-hm.

16:47.401 --> 16:50.389
Not that I feel like it,
after all that.

16:50.401 --> 16:51.461
I can imagine.

17:05.401 --> 17:06.461
Hi.

17:12.453 --> 17:14.401
Hello.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.433
From your message,
I figured it must be important,

17:16.444 --> 17:19.373
so I thought I might include Jack.

17:19.385 --> 17:22.449
So, what's the emergency?

17:25.425 --> 17:28.388
I know how much you've put into
the Blakely investigation

17:28.405 --> 17:31.413
and we've been working closely
together on it.

17:31.429 --> 17:34.453
So I wanted to talk things through
with you before I went to Tony.

17:34.465 --> 17:36.401
No happy news then?

17:36.417 --> 17:38.445
As you know, there are weaknesses
in the case against Vasilich...

17:38.461 --> 17:42.385
As you know, we need a win.
Sure. But there are wins and wins.

17:43.385 --> 17:46.385
What you really need is a clean
result, as quickly as possible.

17:46.397 --> 17:47.433
That's right, isn't it?

17:49.445 --> 17:51.441
In fact,
isn't that better for all of us?

17:51.453 --> 17:53.369
Go on.

17:54.409 --> 17:57.373
My suggestion is
we offer Dianne a reduction.

17:57.385 --> 17:58.373
To what?

17:58.389 --> 18:00.373
Manslaughter,
but she has to plead guilty.

18:00.389 --> 18:02.457
Without a body, we don't know
what happened to Steven Blakely.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.425
Perhaps it was an accident?
In fact, that makes more sense.

18:05.441 --> 18:08.425
They argued, Blakely turned his back,
Dianne pushed him, he tripped...

18:08.441 --> 18:10.409
Or she might have walked in
and shot him.

18:10.425 --> 18:13.437
Might have, exactly. Which is hardly
'beyond reasonable doubt', is it?

18:13.453 --> 18:16.417
If the charge is manslaughter,
the evidence is overwhelming

18:16.433 --> 18:18.449
and pleading will probably
be attractive to her.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.437
Because we'd be letting her
off the hook?

18:20.453 --> 18:23.377
We'd be getting a conviction
and sending her to jail.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.429
She'd be out in what, 3-4 years?
Or we stay with murder

18:25.445 --> 18:28.417
and she gets acquitted,
which is looking increasingly likely.

18:28.433 --> 18:31.429
You have been against prosecuting
this from the start, haven't you?

18:31.445 --> 18:34.417
Do you have something against
Blakely, or just cops in general?

18:34.433 --> 18:37.373
Whoa, whoa, easy, easy.
Why don't you take a deep breath?

18:37.389 --> 18:40.381
Yeah, alright. I'll take mine
outside. See you tomorrow, Jack.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.441
If you want to make sure we get
the right outcome, this is the way.

18:47.453 --> 18:49.409
And how about Blakely's children?

18:49.425 --> 18:51.389
How are they going to feel about
this?

18:52.433 --> 18:54.457
Better than if Dianne walks.

18:57.373 --> 18:59.393
I'll talk to Andy.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.449
You do what you have to do.

19:20.433 --> 19:23.457
Putting the antiseptic cream
on his sore head was awful,

19:24.373 --> 19:26.393
but otherwise it's actually been
a pretty good day.

19:26.405 --> 19:28.385
Poor little thing slept so soundly.

19:28.397 --> 19:29.457
Exhausted, I s'pose.

19:30.369 --> 19:31.465
I feel guilty that I'm enjoying it.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.389
It's hard not to love
a sleeping baby.

19:34.405 --> 19:39.445
You know, I was thinking, it might be
worth getting you some help.

19:39.457 --> 19:41.421
What do you mean?

19:41.433 --> 19:44.393
I don't know. Maybe a nanny.

19:44.409 --> 19:47.381
I thought we agreed that I was going
to take the kids this year.

19:47.397 --> 19:50.405
No, you'd still have the kids. It'd
just take some of the pressure off.

19:50.421 --> 19:53.449
Should I be offended? Like Ash
isn't coping, she needs help.

19:53.465 --> 19:57.445
It's not about coping or not coping.
I'm just suggesting we try it out.

19:57.461 --> 20:00.429
Well, you never got a nanny.
I can't see why I should.

20:00.445 --> 20:03.457
Can you please check the pockets
before you put things in the wash!

20:04.373 --> 20:05.401
Heard that.
What?

20:05.417 --> 20:07.449
Guess I'm a crappy housekeeper
as well as a crappy mum.

20:07.465 --> 20:10.417
No, none of us are perfect.
I do things that annoy you too...

20:10.433 --> 20:13.465
It's fine. And you're right. Maybe
I do need some help around here.

20:14.377 --> 20:15.465
I'll put the dinner on.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.453
Did forensics find anything
in the coat?

20:40.369 --> 20:42.445
They hadn't looked inside the
pockets and they found blood.

20:42.461 --> 20:45.373
Dry-cleaning hadn't got it.
Blakely's blood?

20:45.389 --> 20:48.397
They're rushing the DNA through now,
but I would bet my right arm on it.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.417
How'd you think of that?
It was all Ash, not me.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.405
Let me know as soon as you get
the DNA back.

20:52.421 --> 20:54.429
If it's positive,
forget the manslaughter deal.

20:54.441 --> 20:56.377
Janet, about last night...

20:56.393 --> 20:58.405
Heat of the moment.
Don't worry about it.

21:03.377 --> 21:05.405
As you know,
we can show that you were

21:05.421 --> 21:07.445
outside Steve Blakely's house
wearing this jacket.

21:07.461 --> 21:11.449
Forensics has now found blood in the
right-hand pocket of that jacket

21:11.465 --> 21:14.381
and DNA tests prove
that it's Mr Blakely's.

21:14.397 --> 21:16.401
In light of these facts, Mrs
Vasilich,

21:16.417 --> 21:18.405
I ask whether you'd like
to make a statement

21:18.417 --> 21:20.389
regarding Steven Blakely's death?

21:25.377 --> 21:29.393
I went to his house, when I heard
that he was going to jail.

21:29.409 --> 21:36.453
I thought, this is my last chance
to confront him about my daughter.

21:37.369 --> 21:40.409
And was Mr Blakely at home
when you arrived?

21:40.421 --> 21:44.393
I knocked on the door.

21:44.409 --> 21:50.389
I could see that the lights were on,
but no-one answered.

21:50.405 --> 21:55.449
So what'd you do?
I was angry, and, um...

21:59.393 --> 22:01.409
I started shouting at him
through the door.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.409
I called him a coward.

22:04.417 --> 22:06.373
Was there an answer?

22:06.385 --> 22:09.441
No. And it made me angrier.

22:09.453 --> 22:13.421
The fact that he was ignoring me.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.461
So I went round the back.

22:16.373 --> 22:18.417
I knocked on the back door.

22:18.429 --> 22:21.437
When I hit it, it swung open.

22:21.449 --> 22:23.385
And then?

22:23.397 --> 22:25.409
I went inside.

22:25.425 --> 22:30.429
It was quiet, and I saw him...
on the floor.

22:30.441 --> 22:33.449
Steven Blakely?

22:33.465 --> 22:36.377
Was he breathing?
I don't know.

22:36.393 --> 22:40.393
I bent down to have a look,
I put my hand in blood.

22:41.417 --> 22:44.461
There was a pool of it... on the
floor.

22:45.377 --> 22:47.465
And then?
Then I walked out.

22:48.377 --> 22:49.413
You walked out,

22:49.429 --> 22:52.425
even though Steven Blakely
appeared to be seriously injured?

22:52.437 --> 22:56.425
I was scared. I rang my son.

22:56.437 --> 22:58.429
I asked him for help.

22:58.445 --> 23:00.441
Mrs Vasilich,
did you in any way contribute

23:00.453 --> 23:02.425
to the injuries Mr Blakely suffered?

23:02.437 --> 23:05.409
No, I did not. I swear.

23:05.425 --> 23:10.453
I even called an ambulance later,
after we left.

23:11.369 --> 23:13.465
Hang on, you...
You called an ambulance?

23:14.377 --> 23:15.421
Triple zero.

23:15.437 --> 23:19.453
I know, I should have
called them sooner,

23:20.369 --> 23:26.393
but somehow I just knew
you were gonna blame me for this.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.389
No, I don't know, I don't...

23:28.405 --> 23:31.461
But you need to go there now.
He's injured, bleeding.

23:32.377 --> 23:34.417
- Is there anyone with him?
- No, look...

23:34.433 --> 23:40.369
He's at 58 Spencer Street.
Just go there, please.

23:40.385 --> 23:42.377
Hello?
It's her voice alright.

23:42.393 --> 23:45.389
The call came from a public phone
at the hospital where her son works.

23:45.405 --> 23:48.433
Why didn't we hear about this sooner?
Ambo said they went to the address,

23:48.449 --> 23:51.417
knocked on the door, had a look
around, no answer, so they left,

23:51.429 --> 23:53.425
presumed it was a prank call.

23:53.437 --> 23:55.425
OK, how do we deal with this?

23:55.437 --> 23:57.369
Well, it could go to intention.

23:57.385 --> 23:59.377
The defence will say that
a call to triple zero

23:59.393 --> 24:00.465
indicates she lacked intention to
kill.

24:01.381 --> 24:04.381
The question is what her intention
was at the time she harmed Blakely.

24:04.397 --> 24:06.389
She may have suffered remorse.
Not relevant.

24:06.405 --> 24:09.421
But we're saying that they'd already
taken the body away in Blakely's car

24:09.437 --> 24:11.413
so why send an ambulance
to an empty house?

24:11.429 --> 24:13.437
People in extreme situations
do strange things.

24:13.453 --> 24:16.405
OK, but you're going to need
to make sense of it for the jury.

24:16.421 --> 24:19.401
If we can, fine. It's not fatal.
We can prove she was there.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.413
Her story about what happens
is implausible,

24:21.429 --> 24:24.429
and we've got the blood.
Should be enough.

24:29.377 --> 24:31.457
Just give me a couple of minutes.
I'll meet you inside.

24:38.405 --> 24:39.453
Hi.
Hi.

24:40.369 --> 24:43.465
I hope Andy or Jack have been keeping
you up to speed with how we're going.

24:44.377 --> 24:46.437
Yeah, they have, thanks.

24:46.449 --> 24:48.433
I can understand your anger.

24:48.449 --> 24:51.457
In your father's matter, I was
arguing strongly for a jail sentence.

24:52.369 --> 24:55.389
Yeah, you were. 8-10 years, right?

24:55.405 --> 24:57.425
I just want to assure you
I'll be arguing just as hard

24:57.441 --> 24:59.433
to see his killers convicted
in this trial.

24:59.449 --> 25:01.381
You better.
I will.

25:01.393 --> 25:03.437
I'm there for him, and for you.

25:06.437 --> 25:08.385
Jack reckons you can't lose.

25:08.401 --> 25:11.461
Well, it's a jury trial,
so anything's possible.

25:12.377 --> 25:14.441
But something's got to go our way,
doesn't it?

25:14.453 --> 25:17.409
I hope so, Drew. It's a strong case.

25:17.421 --> 25:19.393
More than that, we just can't say.

25:23.441 --> 25:27.393
We've all heard the expression,
'anything is possible',

25:27.409 --> 25:31.385
and of course in one sense,
you know, that's true.

25:31.401 --> 25:38.441
My four-year-old niece says there
are invisible fairies in her garden,

25:38.457 --> 25:41.457
and I can't really prove
that she's wrong.

25:42.369 --> 25:43.433
Well, not a hundred percent.

25:43.449 --> 25:48.381
But in real life, we don't trouble
ourselves with mere possibilities.

25:48.397 --> 25:51.413
We know that some things are so
unlikely, we can safely dismiss them.

25:51.429 --> 25:54.385
Well, the law takes exactly
the same attitude.

25:54.401 --> 25:57.445
In the course of this trial,
the defence will offer you

25:57.461 --> 26:00.369
an account of what happened
to Steven Blakely.

26:00.381 --> 26:02.405
It's a story in which Dianne Vasilich

26:02.421 --> 26:06.417
just happened to go to Mr Blakely's
house on the night he died,

26:06.429 --> 26:08.393
just happened to find the door open,

26:08.409 --> 26:11.397
just happened to find Mr Blakely
on the floor, unconscious,

26:11.413 --> 26:13.397
just happened to put her hand
in his blood,

26:13.413 --> 26:16.397
and then just happened
to flee the scene.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.409
The defence will point out

26:18.425 --> 26:21.421
that all of this is possible,
and of course it is.

26:21.437 --> 26:24.389
It's possible,
but it's not the kind of possibility

26:24.401 --> 26:26.373
we normally waste our time with.

26:27.389 --> 26:29.373
And neither does the law.

26:29.389 --> 26:35.369
By comparison, the Crown will offer
you a credible, persuasive account

26:35.385 --> 26:38.413
of what happened, the only account
that makes sense of all the facts

26:38.429 --> 26:41.401
without requiring you
to believe in fairytales.

26:44.421 --> 26:46.385
Nothing further, Your Honour.

26:46.397 --> 26:47.461
Miss Warden.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.377
The Crown has claimed
that their version of events

26:53.393 --> 26:56.381
is the only one that makes sense
of all the facts.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.413
Yet there are many facts
that do not fit their account.

26:59.429 --> 27:04.457
Facts that they will ignore or
downplay. But still, they are facts.

27:05.369 --> 27:08.381
That they are yet to produce a body.

27:08.397 --> 27:11.413
That Dianne Vasilich
made a triple zero call

27:11.429 --> 27:14.397
the night Steven Blakely
disappeared,

27:14.409 --> 27:17.381
sending an ambulance to his home.

27:17.397 --> 27:21.465
Would a killer really do that?
And why?

27:22.381 --> 27:26.441
That Dianne Vasilich
overcame and murdered a man

27:26.453 --> 27:29.413
of Steven Blakely's size and power,

27:29.429 --> 27:31.397
that's probably troubled you
already,

27:31.413 --> 27:34.437
struck you as unlikely,
and so it should.

27:34.453 --> 27:38.369
But the most troubling part
of the Crown's case

27:38.381 --> 27:41.369
is that Dianne Vasilich is a woman

27:41.385 --> 27:47.389
with absolutely no history
of criminality or violence,

27:47.405 --> 27:50.385
whose only argument
with her supposed victim

27:50.401 --> 27:55.405
was that he may not have
investigated her daughter's murder

27:55.417 --> 27:56.453
with sufficient energy.

27:57.369 --> 28:00.457
That is a reason to be frustrated,
perhaps to make a complaint,

28:01.373 --> 28:04.405
maybe even to write to a newspaper,
but to kill?

28:04.417 --> 28:06.417
Is that really plausible?

28:06.433 --> 28:09.429
Yet this is what the Crown case
relies upon.

28:09.445 --> 28:13.425
The only credible account
of the night's events.

28:16.413 --> 28:18.381
Thank you, Your Honour.

28:22.389 --> 28:24.441
Well, so far,
everything we expected.

28:26.425 --> 28:31.453
So you're on the way to the
Committal? Yep. How do I look?

28:32.369 --> 28:33.401
Fabulous.
Credible?

28:33.417 --> 28:35.393
Very.
Fabulously credible.

28:35.405 --> 28:37.377
I'm sure you'll be terrific.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.441
So how's Owen? Not too pushy?

28:40.457 --> 28:42.425
No, fine.
On top of his brief?

28:42.441 --> 28:44.445
He's talked you through your
evidence? Yep.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.397
You'll be fine.

28:47.413 --> 28:51.425
We're about to walk over. Are you...
Ready? Yes. All set. Let's go.

28:51.441 --> 28:55.401
Hey, listen, your identity is still
unknown to the offenders,

28:55.417 --> 28:57.417
so there's no need to be
intimidated.

28:57.433 --> 28:58.465
I'm not.
Good.

28:59.381 --> 29:01.441
But they do know that I'm
prosecuting,

29:01.457 --> 29:05.369
so it might be easier for you
if we're not all together.

29:05.385 --> 29:07.429
Oh, sure.
OK.

29:20.373 --> 29:21.421
Wanker.

29:21.437 --> 29:24.461
How's it going, ladies?

29:56.433 --> 29:58.381
You want a moment?

29:59.433 --> 30:02.389
I... I can't.

30:02.405 --> 30:05.405
Yes, you can.
No.

30:05.417 --> 30:07.397
No, come on, we can do it together.

30:07.413 --> 30:10.393
Erin, Erin, Erin, Erin!
Erin, it's gonna be OK.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.784
It's gonna be alright.
No, you go.

30:11.881 --> 30:13.449
Are you kidding?
I'll get you home.

30:13.465 --> 30:15.425
No, you have to.
Erin...

30:15.437 --> 30:17.461
I'll get a cab. Don't worry. Go.

30:23.377 --> 30:25.437
Your Honour, as you know,
one of the Crown's key witnesses

30:25.449 --> 30:27.429
has sadly taken ill very suddenly.

30:27.445 --> 30:30.461
However, we believe
that Mr Collard's confession

30:31.381 --> 30:34.405
along with his detailed statement
against Mr Franzen are more than enough

30:34.421 --> 30:37.369
to establish a prima facie case
against both men

30:37.385 --> 30:39.425
in respect of the crime
with which they are charged.

30:39.441 --> 30:42.441
In that case, the witness is yours,
Mr Hadley.

30:42.461 --> 30:46.393
Mr Collard, in the course of giving your
statement you were shown a photograph

30:46.409 --> 30:49.417
of two men alleged to be the
murderers of Ms Petrakis.

30:49.437 --> 30:52.457
You were then asked to identify
whether one of those men is Mr Franzen.

30:53.373 --> 30:58.437
You answered, 'Yeah, well, yeah,
looks like him, doesn't it?'

30:58.449 --> 31:00.445
Yeah.

31:00.461 --> 31:04.433
That statement, 'looks like him',
what'd you base that on?

31:04.449 --> 31:09.401
The man's face is covered in the
photo. His leather is plain black.

31:09.413 --> 31:10.449
Well, mate, they had us.

31:11.369 --> 31:14.385
You know, I mean, we were fucked anyway,
so we might as well get on with it.

31:14.401 --> 31:16.453
Drop me in it, ya mouthy little
prick, I'll fuckin' kill ya!

31:16.465 --> 31:18.401
Restrain this man!

31:18.417 --> 31:20.393
You're a gutless piece of shit,
Collard.

31:20.409 --> 31:22.413
You're a piece of shit, Collard!
I'll kill ya!

31:22.425 --> 31:24.389
You're fuckin' dead, you...

31:24.405 --> 31:26.385
Remove the prisoner from the
courtroom

31:26.397 --> 31:28.381
and return him to his cell.

31:28.397 --> 31:30.453
Clear the court.
I'm adjourning this matter.

31:35.373 --> 31:36.437
Yes, anyone.

31:36.453 --> 31:40.437
Any potential nanny must have
a police check before we interview.

31:43.389 --> 31:45.413
I think it's going to be
a late one tonight.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.409
Sorry, darl. Thanks, bye.

31:47.425 --> 31:50.441
I just got a revised list of defence
witnesses for the Vasilich matter.

31:50.457 --> 31:54.433
And?
They're calling Dianne, tomorrow.

31:55.433 --> 31:58.417
Pull out her statement and
the police background file on her.

31:58.429 --> 32:00.385
I need all we've got.

32:04.417 --> 32:10.377
I know it was wrong, and stupid,
leaving him there, injured.

32:10.389 --> 32:11.421
So why did you do it?

32:11.433 --> 32:13.433
After my daughter was murdered,

32:13.449 --> 32:15.445
my experience with the police
wasn't good.

32:15.457 --> 32:19.385
They talked down to me. Arrogant.

32:19.397 --> 32:22.389
Soon I didn't trust them anymore.

32:22.405 --> 32:24.389
The prosecution allege that this was
your motive

32:24.401 --> 32:27.449
for killing Steven Blakely the
resentment that you felt towards him

32:27.461 --> 32:29.421
and towards the police in general,

32:29.437 --> 32:33.369
after the death of your daughter.
Did you feel such resentment?

32:33.385 --> 32:38.445
I don't hate the police.
I didn't hate Steven Blakely.

32:38.461 --> 32:40.457
I just wanted justice for my
daughter.

32:41.373 --> 32:43.465
That's all I've ever wanted,
all these years.

32:44.381 --> 32:47.449
Same as any mother.
So Mr Blakely's death,

32:47.465 --> 32:51.369
if he is dead,
how do you feel about that?

32:51.385 --> 32:53.373
Terrible.
Why?

32:53.389 --> 32:55.397
Because I want to find
my daughter's killer.

32:55.413 --> 32:59.405
How would hurting Steven Blakely
help me?

32:59.421 --> 33:04.413
Thank you, Mrs Vasilich.
No more questions.

33:07.385 --> 33:08.409
Madam Crown.

33:16.405 --> 33:18.461
Mrs Vasilich, your daughter was,
by all accounts,

33:19.377 --> 33:21.445
exceptionally beautiful
and vivacious, yes?

33:21.457 --> 33:22.465
Yes.

33:23.381 --> 33:25.369
The world was her oyster,
you might say.

33:25.381 --> 33:28.369
For a while.

33:28.385 --> 33:30.465
So why did she turn
to prostitution?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.421
I don't know.

33:32.441 --> 33:35.445
Did it coincide with a bitter
separation between you and your husband?

33:35.461 --> 33:38.393
Objection, Your Honour.
Is this relevant?

33:38.409 --> 33:41.429
Your Honour, my learned colleague
cannot call the accused to the box

33:41.449 --> 33:45.381
and then object to me asking
questions relating to motive and character.

33:45.393 --> 33:46.429
She made it an issue.

33:46.445 --> 33:49.449
Overruled, but keep it relevant,
please.

33:51.385 --> 33:56.429
Is it true your daughter felt utterly
betrayed when her father left?

33:56.441 --> 33:58.385
It hurt us all.

33:58.401 --> 34:00.429
But her closest bond
was with her father, wasn't it?

34:00.445 --> 34:03.377
And he had just abandoned her.
And me.

34:03.393 --> 34:06.385
You didn't even know what happened
to Oriana after that, did you?

34:06.401 --> 34:08.405
There was a complete estrangement
for two years

34:08.417 --> 34:09.465
and then suddenly she was dead.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.380
I put it to you that you
had to find who killed her

34:12.397 --> 34:14.417
because otherwise,
you could only blame yourself.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.449
I just wanted justice for...

34:15.465 --> 34:18.437
No, you desperately needed someone
to get you off the hook.

34:18.453 --> 34:20.465
That's why it became obsessive,
wasn't it?

34:21.380 --> 34:24.400
Because it wasn't just a frustration
with a lack of justice.

34:24.417 --> 34:27.369
It was a mother's guilt.
I just wanted justice, alright?

34:27.385 --> 34:29.425
When she was hurting most,
you weren't there for her.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.373
That's a lie.
Is it?

34:31.389 --> 34:34.405
I wasn't obsessive
and I didn't hate anyone.

34:34.417 --> 34:37.400
I just wanted justice for Oriana!

34:47.405 --> 34:49.405
No more questions, Your Honour.

34:56.397 --> 34:59.465
Lina, you got those two bikies
past the committal?

35:00.381 --> 35:03.457
Yep, heading for trial and hopefully
inside for a very, very long time.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.465
Good. How's Erin?

35:06.377 --> 35:07.449
She's not answering.

35:07.465 --> 35:11.373
I sent her a text and she came back
that she's fine,

35:11.389 --> 35:13.144
got a migraine,
back in the office asap.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.638
Well, maybe she's just got a
migraine.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.413
- Janet, I... - If that's her story,
it's my story too.

35:17.425 --> 35:18.461
OK. What?

35:19.077 --> 35:20.797
I wanted to warn you
that Maya Blakely is...

35:20.830 --> 35:22.385
Right behind me, thank you.

35:22.397 --> 35:23.425
I was explaining to Maya

35:23.441 --> 35:25.413
about how unusual that sort of day
in court is...

35:25.429 --> 35:27.401
Yeah, could I just have a minute,
please?

35:27.413 --> 35:28.461
OK, bye.

35:31.421 --> 35:35.369
I spent a long time hating you.
I know.

35:35.385 --> 35:37.385
But I really loved you in there
just then.

35:37.401 --> 35:39.437
I wish you could have gone on
for another hour or two.

35:39.453 --> 35:42.425
Sadly, I think I might have
gone on too long.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.433
When the judge sums it up for the
jury, she'll probably tell him

35:45.449 --> 35:48.381
to ignore anything
that isn't supported by evidence.

35:48.397 --> 35:51.401
Weren't you watching the jury? They
could see that you got it right.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.381
I could too.
I know. I know you did.

35:53.393 --> 35:54.445
That was the plan.

35:54.461 --> 35:57.409
Just to leave them with a feeling
they can't quite ignore,

35:57.421 --> 35:58.457
even if they're told to.

35:59.373 --> 36:01.425
Are you telling me
it's seriously still in doubt?

36:01.441 --> 36:04.373
It's always in doubt, Maya,
until the jury comes back.

36:04.389 --> 36:08.389
Well, we'll just...
We'll just see then, hey?

36:08.405 --> 36:10.465
I appreciate your honesty.
Thank you.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.405
That's alright.

36:12.417 --> 36:14.417
Janet, have you got five?

36:14.433 --> 36:18.401
About what? Erin? No. Something a bit
unusual, actually.

36:18.417 --> 36:21.461
One of my accused wants to confess,
but he won't talk to me.

36:22.373 --> 36:23.433
He insists on telling you.

36:23.449 --> 36:26.377
One of the bikies?
Yes. Toby Franzen.

36:26.389 --> 36:27.425
Why does he want to talk to me?

36:27.441 --> 36:30.377
He won't say, and usually
we'd just tell him to fuck off.

36:30.393 --> 36:32.401
But if he's going to confess
to the murder charge,

36:32.413 --> 36:33.449
I'm not gonna argue with him.

36:34.369 --> 36:36.461
Maybe he thinks you're a softer
target when it comes to making a deal.

36:37.377 --> 36:39.393
Bullshit.
If it is bullshit, just walk away.

36:40.421 --> 36:42.437
So how's your thing going?

36:42.453 --> 36:45.393
That bitch you've got
for the Blakely murder.

36:45.405 --> 36:47.393
I'm sorry, did you want to see me

36:47.409 --> 36:49.417
about the Petrakis murder
or the Blakely murder?

36:49.429 --> 36:52.385
Blakely? Dianne Vasilich.

36:52.401 --> 36:55.417
I got a real good story about her.
Do you know Mrs Vasilich?

36:55.429 --> 36:56.441
Fuck yeah.

36:56.457 --> 36:59.377
Met her in our chapter pub
up in Parramatta,

36:59.389 --> 37:00.425
about ten years ago now.

37:00.441 --> 37:02.461
She comes in all worked up,
looking for some muscle.

37:03.377 --> 37:05.377
Looking to hire some muscle?
Yeah.

37:05.393 --> 37:08.389
Bartender thought she was fuckin'
nuts, but still, he pointed me out

37:08.405 --> 37:10.437
and told her to go see
the mad bastard in the corner.

37:10.453 --> 37:15.377
She comes over, she's all stressed,
red-faced and shit.

37:15.389 --> 37:16.437
Said she needed some help.

37:16.453 --> 37:19.405
Said she'd been trying to get this
bloke to tell her for ages

37:19.421 --> 37:22.405
who had knocked off her daughter.
Anyway, she was sick of his shit.

37:22.417 --> 37:23.671
I said, 'Fair enough. Who is he?'

37:23.672 --> 37:27.401
And she says, 'It's Steve Blakely'.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.465
Turns out her daughter was Oriana.

37:30.381 --> 37:32.373
Bit of a famous case in the day,
yeah?

37:32.389 --> 37:36.369
Did you know Oriana?
Yeah. Yeah, we all did.

37:36.385 --> 37:41.073
Yeah, we liked her too.
She was a real good chick, Oriana.

37:41.123 --> 37:42.425
What'd you say to Mrs Vasilich?

37:42.441 --> 37:46.393
Said he probably wouldn't talk,
not unless we really belted him.

37:46.405 --> 37:47.992
She said belt him, she didn't care.

37:48.369 --> 37:49.768
And I said we might have to...

37:50.441 --> 37:54.401
Said we might have
to finish the job after that,

37:54.417 --> 37:57.369
and for that,
she'd be looking at 20 grand.

37:57.385 --> 38:01.381
But I'd need 10 of it up front.
She didn't even blink.

38:01.397 --> 38:03.417
So she paid you the cash?
Yeah.

38:03.433 --> 38:05.465
Went off, came back an hour later,
handed it over.

38:06.381 --> 38:08.381
And?
And what?

38:08.397 --> 38:11.373
What'd you do?
Nothin'.

38:11.389 --> 38:14.405
I wasn't gonna go near Steve
Blakely. A top cop like him?

38:14.421 --> 38:16.373
What do you think I am, fuckin'
crazy?

38:16.389 --> 38:18.369
So you just took the money?
Yeah.

38:18.385 --> 38:20.413
What was she gonna do, go to the
cops?

38:20.425 --> 38:23.413
Easiest 10 grand I ever made.

38:26.457 --> 38:28.429
It's a pretty good story, yeah?

38:28.445 --> 38:30.437
And you'll give this evidence in
court?

38:34.409 --> 38:38.409
You get me immunity from prosecution
for this drive-by thing, yeah.

38:38.421 --> 38:40.389
I'll go to your court,

38:40.405 --> 38:42.461
I'll take an oath and I'll tell 'em
everything I know.

38:45.417 --> 38:47.381
He's bullshitting.

38:47.397 --> 38:49.413
Dianne withdrew 10 grand
from her savings account

38:49.429 --> 38:51.421
on the afternoon Franzen says
he met with her.

38:51.433 --> 38:53.377
And the bartender's confirmed it.

38:53.393 --> 38:56.373
I understand where you're coming
from but I'm not gonna agree...

38:56.389 --> 38:58.453
Tony, I need to convince my jury
that a grief-stricken mother

38:59.369 --> 39:01.377
has a violent and obsessive streak
and now I can.

39:01.393 --> 39:03.409
These men executed a key witness
in a murder trial.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.429
That has profound
public policy implications.

39:05.445 --> 39:07.413
As does killing a senior police
officer.

39:07.429 --> 39:09.405
Sure, but let's take
a wider perspective.

39:09.421 --> 39:11.457
How are we gonna look if someone
as notorious as Franzen

39:12.373 --> 39:14.425
can walk out a free man?
What are the headlines going to say?

39:14.441 --> 39:17.381
Petrakis shooter convicted,
hopefully. Huh, you reckon?

39:17.393 --> 39:18.437
When I play Collard's confession,

39:18.453 --> 39:20.445
everyone's gonna know
it was Franzen's idea.

39:20.461 --> 39:23.429
He's the mastermind. We're going to
be accused of convicting

39:23.445 --> 39:26.417
the guy who lit the Reichstag fire
and letting Hitler walk away.

39:26.429 --> 39:28.373
Collard isn't that much of a patsy.

39:28.389 --> 39:30.405
He did shoot Zebina Petrakis
and he will go to jail.

39:30.425 --> 39:33.425
And if the woman who killed Steve
Blakely does too, that's a double win.

39:33.441 --> 39:35.449
I mean, if we're taking
a wider perspective here,

39:35.461 --> 39:37.397
isn't that the best outcome?

39:37.413 --> 39:40.425
Can you even call Franzen as a
witness? Haven't you already...

39:40.441 --> 39:43.393
I'll make an application to reopen.
If the judge says no?

39:43.409 --> 39:46.377
I thought you wanted to see
Steve Blakely's killer convicted.

39:46.393 --> 39:48.457
Well, excuse me, but I thought
you already had enough to do it.

39:49.373 --> 39:51.393
From a supposed friend of the family.
Enough!

39:51.409 --> 39:53.453
Stop there, both of you.
Don't get personal.

39:53.465 --> 39:55.421
Let me think on it.

39:55.433 --> 39:59.449
And while I am, you two, play nice!

40:09.413 --> 40:11.449
Is this running away?

40:11.465 --> 40:13.437
No, it's a ciggie break
without a ciggie.

40:13.453 --> 40:15.445
God, I wish I still smoked.
Can we just...

40:15.461 --> 40:18.445
Let's just chat, without the shouting
and the name calling, OK?

40:18.461 --> 40:21.385
He's the new boy, Janet.
He feels isolated.

40:21.401 --> 40:23.401
He's an arrogant, patronising show
pony.

40:23.413 --> 40:24.712
What was that about name calling?

40:24.741 --> 40:26.461
And before you say any more,
I should tell you.

40:26.577 --> 40:28.327
I'm inclined to agree with him.
What?

40:28.461 --> 40:31.425
You've closed the case. Chances of
getting leave to reopen it

40:31.445 --> 40:34.445
will depend on whether Justice Cousins
had a good night's sleep or not.

40:34.461 --> 40:36.413
You have told me
I must win this case.

40:36.429 --> 40:40.413
Don't say that and then stop me from
leading this evidence. It's critical.

40:42.461 --> 40:44.413
Being the Director of the DPP

40:44.429 --> 40:46.421
is a royal pain in the arse, you
know that.

40:46.437 --> 40:49.401
And you love every minute of it.
Ha!

41:09.377 --> 41:11.373
Hello, mate. Thanks for
coming.

41:11.385 --> 41:12.421
It's an honour.

41:12.437 --> 41:14.461
To be pressured by a police officer
of your standing.

41:16.449 --> 41:19.465
You're a sharp bastard, aye.
Oh, it doesn't take Einstein.

41:20.381 --> 41:22.425
Open rooftop,
away from prying eyes and ears.

41:22.437 --> 41:24.417
So, what am I gonna tell ya?

41:24.433 --> 41:27.393
Well, I imagine
it's along the lines of,

41:27.409 --> 41:30.369
'Steven Blakely was a cop.
I was a cop.

41:30.385 --> 41:32.417
And we've always got to
look after the boys in the job.'

41:32.429 --> 41:34.377
Bang on.

41:34.389 --> 41:35.453
Well, partly.

41:36.369 --> 41:39.369
I would say that and if I did say
that I'd mean it.

41:39.385 --> 41:42.373
But then I'd be telling you something
you already know, wouldn't I?

41:43.429 --> 41:45.413
Oh, yeah, what is it I don't know?

41:45.429 --> 41:48.433
The thing you don't know is that
by agreeing to this immunity,

41:48.449 --> 41:51.433
it could be a smart move for you
as well as Janet.

41:54.461 --> 41:58.461
OK. I'm still listening.

42:01.429 --> 42:04.393
What's your big goal for the year,
Owen?

42:04.409 --> 42:06.409
I'm not talking about individual
trials.

42:06.425 --> 42:09.193
I mean, in a career sense.
Senior Counsel.

42:09.205 --> 42:10.447
Thought it might have been that.

42:10.448 --> 42:12.449
What is it with that?
Some sort of prestige, wanky...

42:12.461 --> 42:14.381
Fuck no, it's the money.

42:14.397 --> 42:17.377
SCs get paid twice as much
as a normal barrister.

42:17.393 --> 42:19.401
You know that every time a barrister
applies

42:19.413 --> 42:21.405
for the Senior Counsel position,

42:21.417 --> 42:23.389
well, the silk committee,

42:23.405 --> 42:25.437
they appoint a colleague to keep an
eye on him,

42:25.453 --> 42:29.401
and then report back
as to his suitability.

42:29.417 --> 42:31.385
They've got Janet King looking at
me?

42:33.385 --> 42:34.421
Bullshit.

42:34.433 --> 42:36.405
Like I said, you're a sharp one.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.453
That's got your attention,
hasn't it?

42:47.389 --> 42:49.457
Ah, come in.

42:51.449 --> 42:53.381
Hi.

42:53.393 --> 42:57.385
So... I assume you've decided.

42:57.401 --> 43:00.465
Yes. We're giving Franzen
his immunity in exchange

43:01.381 --> 43:03.429
for the evidence you require
in the Blakely matter.

43:05.413 --> 43:07.409
Appreciated.
Pleasure.

43:07.425 --> 43:09.445
Got out on the right side of the bed
today, did we?

43:09.461 --> 43:15.397
No, actually something you
said just really stuck with me.

43:15.413 --> 43:17.453
You called me
a 'supposed friend of the family'.

43:18.369 --> 43:21.437
Couldn't stop thinking
about Drew and Maya after that.

43:21.453 --> 43:24.449
Everything they've been through,
with Sally and then Steve.

43:24.461 --> 43:28.417
And you know I, ah, called Jack

43:28.429 --> 43:30.369
and he's been talking to them,

43:30.385 --> 43:33.465
and they really feel that you partly
want to win this for them.

43:34.381 --> 43:37.433
Which must give them a sense
that somebody still cares.

43:37.449 --> 43:39.425
And I couldn't help feeling that
sometimes

43:39.441 --> 43:41.465
we have to put that sort of stuff
first.

43:42.381 --> 43:45.453
Anyway, just make sure you win it,
yeah?

43:45.465 --> 43:47.453
Um...

43:49.397 --> 43:51.385
Good luck with Collard.

43:51.397 --> 43:53.405
Thank you.

43:55.377 --> 43:57.401
Thanks, Tony Aah...

44:03.413 --> 44:06.405
Did you...?
Ah, nothing to do with me.

44:06.417 --> 44:10.369
Still, it's a result, right?

44:10.385 --> 44:12.417
Your Honour,
there's an extremely urgent matter

44:12.433 --> 44:15.373
which has just come to light
for the prosecution case.

44:15.385 --> 44:16.789
Isn't your case closed, Madam Crown?

44:16.790 --> 44:19.421
Which is why I'm seeking
Your Honour's leave to reopen it.

44:19.433 --> 44:20.702
Without any notice at all!

44:20.869 --> 44:22.793
Your Honour, of course
I would have led it earlier

44:22.844 --> 44:24.346
if it had come to hand earlier.

44:25.369 --> 44:27.385
But how can we hope
to answer it properly?

44:27.401 --> 44:30.377
The accused has a right to know the
case she's being asked to answer,

44:30.393 --> 44:31.875
not simply have it dumped in our
lap.

44:31.876 --> 44:34.393
And doesn't the prosecution
have the right to lead,

44:34.409 --> 44:37.377
and the jury, the right to hear,
the full story?

44:37.389 --> 44:39.385
Your Honour, at this late hour...

44:39.397 --> 44:40.682
At this late hour in the process,

44:40.683 --> 44:43.377
I'm reluctant to throw away
the entire trial.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.385
If there is a pertinent issue

44:45.401 --> 44:49.377
which will allow this matter
to be decided now in this court,

44:49.389 --> 44:51.373
then it should be heard,

44:51.389 --> 44:54.433
so I will allow you to reopen
your case, Madam Crown.

44:54.445 --> 44:56.421
Thank you, Your Honour.

44:56.433 --> 44:58.417
Bring the jury back in.

45:11.437 --> 45:14.421
Let's see how this goes over.

45:29.377 --> 45:31.373
I, Tobias Henry Franzen...

45:31.385 --> 45:32.445
I, Tobias Henry Franzen...

45:32.461 --> 45:35.409
..swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth

45:35.421 --> 45:36.599
and nothing but the truth.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.433
..the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

45:38.449 --> 45:41.381
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

45:47.421 --> 45:49.461
Mr Franzen,
I'd like to ask you about

45:50.377 --> 45:54.441
April the 1st, 2004,
in the Lionsgate Hotel.

45:54.457 --> 45:57.449
Did you meet
Dianne Vasilich there that day?

45:59.373 --> 46:00.457
Yeah. Sure did.

46:01.369 --> 46:03.393
Mum. Mum!

46:03.405 --> 46:04.457
Someone call an ambulance!

46:05.373 --> 46:07.461
Clear the court.
Call a medical officer.

46:08.377 --> 46:10.397
Give her some room. Mum!
She's fainted.

46:17.377 --> 46:19.449
Well, if our list of witnesses
is settled,

46:19.461 --> 46:21.417
I think we might adjourn, gentlemen,

46:21.433 --> 46:23.465
in the hope of starting the trial
proper in the morning.

46:24.377 --> 46:25.421
Your Honour, if I may?

46:25.437 --> 46:27.429
The defence would like to ask for
one last ruling.

46:29.373 --> 46:30.425
Yes?

46:30.441 --> 46:34.373
We submit that Mr Collard's supposed
confession be ruled inadmissible.

46:34.385 --> 46:35.397
What?

46:35.409 --> 46:36.433
On close inspection,

46:36.449 --> 46:38.417
Your Honour will see that it was
made under duress

46:38.433 --> 46:40.453
and in the presence
of clear police intimidation.

46:41.369 --> 46:42.445
Your Honour,
no objection has been raised

46:42.461 --> 46:44.461
to the record of interview
prior to this time.

46:45.373 --> 46:46.433
Sadly, Mr Collard was so intimidated

46:46.449 --> 46:49.393
he only felt safe bringing it
to my attention yesterday.

46:49.405 --> 46:50.423
You can't rule out a confession.

46:50.424 --> 46:53.409
Is this intimidation evident
on the tape, Mr Hadley?

46:53.421 --> 46:54.445
It is, Your Honour, and...

46:54.461 --> 46:57.445
Your Honour, this record of
interview is entirely unremarkable-

46:57.461 --> 46:59.465
Mr Crown, please.
We will play a key passage.

47:00.377 --> 47:01.401
Thank you, Mr Hadley.

47:01.413 --> 47:03.465
Your Honour will note,

47:04.381 --> 47:06.429
Detective Sergeant Renner looms over
Mr Collard

47:06.445 --> 47:09.373
just prior to his making
the relevant statements,

47:09.385 --> 47:10.433
assuming a threatening posture.

47:10.449 --> 47:12.437
You seen that tattoo anywhere
before?

47:12.453 --> 47:14.445
You can clearly see how nervous and
scared my client is

47:14.457 --> 47:16.385
in this situation.

47:16.401 --> 47:18.409
He's just been caught.
Wouldn't you be nervous?

47:18.421 --> 47:19.421
And if we continue.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.409
Like you to take a look at this
photo

47:22.425 --> 47:24.445
from the CCTV footage outside the
courtroom.

47:24.461 --> 47:28.429
So we've got your bike,
identified you,

47:28.445 --> 47:31.449
we've got your gun
with your prints on it.

47:31.465 --> 47:35.413
Son, do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

47:35.425 --> 47:37.397
At this point, Mr Collard says

47:37.413 --> 47:39.421
he knew how the New South Wales
police operate,

47:39.437 --> 47:42.433
and he knew they were going to frame
him no matter what he said

47:42.449 --> 47:45.405
and he feared for his safety,
indeed his life, if he didn't...

47:45.421 --> 47:47.397
Your Honour, please, some common
sense.

47:47.409 --> 47:49.389
It's a perfectly normal interview!

47:49.405 --> 47:51.461
Detective Sergeant Renner
is a very imposing man, I see.

47:52.377 --> 47:54.401
Your Honour, Detective Renner
is merely standing up

47:54.417 --> 47:56.373
to show the accused some
photographs.

47:56.389 --> 48:00.393
At law, intimidation
can be subtle or implied.

48:00.409 --> 48:03.421
As long as it acts to oppress
the mind of the accused,

48:03.437 --> 48:06.413
coercing him into making a
confession. A man's posture...

48:06.429 --> 48:10.373
Detective Renner's posture is that
of a man leaning over a table.

48:10.389 --> 48:13.389
Detective Renner has here acted
very subtly,

48:13.405 --> 48:16.445
but the threat in his posture would
have been as clear to my client

48:16.461 --> 48:20.377
as it is to any reasonable viewer
of the tape.

48:20.393 --> 48:23.373
Your Honour, this submission
should be dismissed immediately.

48:23.389 --> 48:25.429
The accused confesses to his crime
on tape.

48:25.445 --> 48:27.433
It is the cornerstone
of the Crown's case.

48:27.449 --> 48:30.425
If the Crown and the police have been
professional and thorough

48:30.441 --> 48:34.445
in building evidence for their case,
they shouldn't need a confession.

48:38.417 --> 48:41.369
Wankers!
It's been struck out.

48:41.381 --> 48:43.377
Collard's confession, inadmissible.

48:43.393 --> 48:45.429
On what grounds?
Police intimidation.

48:45.445 --> 48:48.405
The learned judge thought Terry
Renner was rather imposing

48:48.421 --> 48:50.433
and poor little Collard
got a little bit scared.

48:50.449 --> 48:52.441
There must have been something in it.
Sure.

48:52.457 --> 48:55.373
He stood up, leant over,
put a photo in front of him.

48:55.389 --> 48:58.377
This is bullshit. Everything about
this system is in their favour.

48:58.393 --> 49:01.381
Well, that's hardly breaking news.
More to the point, where are we?

49:01.397 --> 49:03.405
Can we move on? What about the bike?
Wasn't it his?

49:03.421 --> 49:05.381
It got stolen a month ago,
apparently.

49:05.397 --> 49:06.869
Didn't report it as it wasn't
insured.

49:06.870 --> 49:08.453
And the weapon with the fingerprints.

49:09.369 --> 49:11.425
Lost it days ago.
Ask anyone at the clubhouse.

49:11.441 --> 49:13.421
He's been looking
all over the place.

49:13.437 --> 49:15.441
OK, I'm sensing it's going to be
a little tough.

49:15.457 --> 49:17.465
Luckily, we've still got
the eyewitness ID.

49:19.173 --> 49:20.622
The tattoo on Collard's hand.

49:21.373 --> 49:24.389
That is, of course,
assuming Erin's right to testify.

49:37.373 --> 49:38.421
Thank you.

49:41.377 --> 49:43.373
So it's up to me, then?

49:43.385 --> 49:45.377
Only if you want to.

49:47.449 --> 49:50.425
Look, you know all the things we say
when we want to make sure

49:50.437 --> 49:52.385
we get a witness in the box,

49:52.401 --> 49:55.457
but you also know we don't blame them
for backing out.

49:56.373 --> 49:59.405
Especially when
it's genuinely dangerous.

49:59.421 --> 50:03.401
Just for God's sake, don't do it for
me, or for Tony or anyone here.

50:03.413 --> 50:04.449
We understand.

50:04.465 --> 50:08.381
We know what happened and frankly,
we're pretty amazed you're even here.

50:08.397 --> 50:10.449
So if you want to do it for you
then do it. If you don't, don't.

50:10.461 --> 50:12.437
It's that simple.

50:15.449 --> 50:17.421
Ms O'Shaughnessy,

50:17.437 --> 50:20.453
in your statement, you said
the motorcycle was moving quickly

50:20.465 --> 50:22.385
when the shot was fired.

50:22.397 --> 50:23.433
Yes.

50:23.445 --> 50:25.393
It was moving quickly.

50:25.409 --> 50:28.405
And it came no closer to Miss
Petrakis than five metres?

50:30.373 --> 50:31.397
About that.

50:31.413 --> 50:33.449
So keeping in mind
the extremely difficult conditions

50:33.461 --> 50:35.417
that I've just described,

50:35.433 --> 50:37.465
how likely is it that you might have
been in error?

50:38.377 --> 50:39.449
10% chance, 20, 30?

50:39.461 --> 50:41.393
Objection.

50:41.405 --> 50:43.377
The chance is zero.

50:43.389 --> 50:44.397
Really?

50:44.409 --> 50:47.373
People miss details all the time.

50:47.385 --> 50:48.437
I understand that.

50:48.449 --> 50:51.433
But I know the tattoo was a spider

50:51.449 --> 50:54.405
because I can still see the moment
he fired,

50:54.417 --> 50:56.429
as clearly as when it happened.

50:56.441 --> 50:58.449
It's still in my head.

50:58.465 --> 51:01.449
I wish I could get rid of it,
but I can't.

51:01.461 --> 51:03.457
I doubt I ever will.

51:04.373 --> 51:06.457
So the chance that I have it wrong
is exactly zero.

51:07.373 --> 51:10.461
So based on this indelible memory,
you were able to accurately identify

51:11.377 --> 51:14.413
the spider tattoo on the shooter
of Miss Petrakis

51:14.429 --> 51:17.465
as the same tattoo worn by Mr
Collard?

51:18.377 --> 51:19.425
That's right.

51:19.437 --> 51:21.373
Mm.

51:21.389 --> 51:23.405
How many tattoos
did the police show you?

51:23.417 --> 51:25.373
Just one.

51:25.385 --> 51:27.377
I drew what I saw

51:27.393 --> 51:30.385
and they brought back a photo and I
said, 'Yes, that's it.'

51:30.401 --> 51:33.397
So to put it another way,
Miss O'Shaughnessy,

51:33.413 --> 51:36.421
you never identified Mr Collard
as the shooter at all.

51:36.433 --> 51:38.457
You merely identified a tattoo.

51:39.369 --> 51:41.417
Well, the tattoo on his hand.

51:41.433 --> 51:44.461
But was it on his hand? How many
others might have the same tattoo?

51:45.373 --> 51:46.409
There could he hundreds.

51:46.421 --> 51:47.808
Why, even in this court room?

51:48.373 --> 51:50.457
How many in this court room
may have the same tattoo?

51:51.373 --> 51:53.409
Check out me tatt, eh?

51:56.369 --> 51:57.437
Sit down in the gallery!

51:57.453 --> 51:59.461
- Stick that up ya, love!
- Sit down!

51:59.973 --> 52:01.392
You'll be objected from the court.

52:01.437 --> 52:04.437
Those are obviously fresh
tattoos done to deceive the court.

52:04.449 --> 52:06.433
Silence, Mr Crown, and be seated.

52:09.417 --> 52:11.405
Withdrawn.

52:11.421 --> 52:14.437
Members of the jury,
may I remind you all,

52:14.453 --> 52:18.385
there is no other piece of evidence
that unequivocally

52:18.401 --> 52:21.385
places the accused
anywhere near the crime.

52:21.401 --> 52:26.385
And yet the police insist the man
in the CCTV footage is Mr Collard.

52:26.401 --> 52:31.417
Why? Because of one tattoo,
which could be anybody's.

52:31.433 --> 52:34.429
Did they look harder? Did they ask
the tough questions? Never.

52:34.441 --> 52:35.716
Please, Your Honour, come on!

52:36.377 --> 52:38.377
Please what, Mr Crown?

52:39.425 --> 52:41.445
Withdrawn.

52:41.457 --> 52:44.409
The fact is,

52:44.425 --> 52:49.405
Mr Collard has maintained his
innocence from the very beginning,

52:49.417 --> 52:51.433
and they have simply gone for him...

52:54.373 --> 52:56.377
..because it's easy.

53:09.437 --> 53:11.417
Guess you've heard.

53:11.429 --> 53:13.401
Why do we even bother?

53:13.413 --> 53:15.417
Because we care?

53:16.417 --> 53:17.461
- Janet?
- Yeah...

53:18.373 --> 53:19.421
The Blakely jury are back.

53:19.433 --> 53:21.413
Good luck.

53:21.425 --> 53:23.409
Thanks.

53:35.437 --> 53:37.417
Have you reached a verdict?

53:39.373 --> 53:40.393
Yes, Your Honour.

53:40.409 --> 53:46.381
On the count of murder, how do you
find the defendant, Dianne Vasilich?

53:47.433 --> 53:49.421
Guilty.

53:52.425 --> 53:55.437
On the count of acting as accessory
after the fact of murder,

53:55.453 --> 53:59.397
how do you find the defendant,
Brian Patrick Vincent?

53:59.409 --> 54:01.377
Guilty.

54:03.401 --> 54:06.461
The matter is stood over for
sentence, date to be fixed.

54:07.373 --> 54:08.437
All rise.

54:11.437 --> 54:14.421
Congratulations.

54:21.401 --> 54:22.441
Thank you.

54:30.377 --> 54:33.417
What was all of that
about maybe losing the case?

54:33.433 --> 54:35.421
Yeah, we got lucky.
If Franzen hadn't...

54:35.433 --> 54:37.449
No. I already told you.

54:37.461 --> 54:41.397
Deep, abiding faith.

54:53.429 --> 54:55.429
This is not only a victory

54:55.445 --> 55:00.373
for the family of Steven Blakely,
this is a victory for justice,

55:00.385 --> 55:02.381
for the justice system,

55:02.397 --> 55:05.449
proving that we can
and will tackle the hard cases.

55:05.465 --> 55:09.405
Steven Blakely was
a brilliant investigator

55:09.417 --> 55:12.409
and it is sad, but fitting,

55:12.425 --> 55:15.461
that his legacy, a team of the very
finest investigators,

55:16.377 --> 55:19.421
were able to use the skills
he taught them

55:19.437 --> 55:23.377
to solve the tragic mystery
of his own final hours.

55:23.393 --> 55:26.397
Chief Superintendent Rizzoli,
how do you respond to claims

55:26.413 --> 55:29.325
police went with the first person
they could in the Petrakis shooting?

55:29.343 --> 55:31.761
To be quite honest, I find that
outrageous and offensive.

55:31.762 --> 55:33.202
But with such lack of evidence?

55:33.203 --> 55:34.410
No, we had plenty of evidence.

55:34.411 --> 55:37.096
The judge, in her wisdom,
simply decided not to allow it.

55:37.288 --> 55:40.252
Some people might think I'm talking
out of turn. I don't care.

55:40.352 --> 55:42.308
Things have gone too far in this
State.

55:42.324 --> 55:44.475
Time and again perpetrators walk
free

55:44.476 --> 55:46.728
because good police work
isn't allowed to be used.

55:46.729 --> 55:48.453
Take the Blakely case for example.

55:48.454 --> 55:50.798
A different judge uses
a bit of common sense

55:50.799 --> 55:52.670
and lo and behold,
the truth comes out.

55:52.671 --> 55:54.695
There's a lesson in that
for all of us.

55:57.611 --> 55:59.647
Andy.
Sorry to call you so late.

55:59.659 --> 56:01.399
What's happened?

56:01.436 --> 56:03.647
I'm down near Gerringong.
Do you know where that is?

56:03.663 --> 56:06.199
South?
Way, way south.

56:06.200 --> 56:08.667
In fact, the round trip's about four
hours, probably,

56:08.679 --> 56:10.679
which is not good news.

56:10.691 --> 56:12.607
Why?

56:12.623 --> 56:15.695
Because a bushwalker just found
Steven Blakely's body out here.

56:16.611 --> 56:20.615
So Dianne and Brian
didn't throw him off North Head.

56:20.631 --> 56:22.683
In fact, given the time it takes
to get here,

56:23.599 --> 56:25.316
they weren't even the ones
who buried him.

56:36.647 --> 56:38.695
Janet King's gung-ho approach in
this trial

56:39.611 --> 56:41.611
has caused a serious miscarriage of
justice.

56:41.627 --> 56:43.599
So who buried him?
I have no idea.

56:43.615 --> 56:46.615
You find this third man or Dianne
and her son will walk.

56:46.627 --> 56:47.639
Blakely and Novak?

56:47.655 --> 56:50.647
They argue for about five minutes,
four hours later Blakely is dead.

56:50.663 --> 56:51.923
Don't fuck up what you've got
by getting involved

56:51.943 --> 56:54.999
in things that don't concern you.
Don't interfere.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.984
Tim Clarke - my child porn man.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.008
Seriously need to think about
getting Clarke off the streets,

56:59.024 --> 57:00.036
he's a bad man.
Get away from her!

57:00.052 --> 57:02.064
Get the fuck away from her!
I know what you do with young girls.

57:02.980 --> 57:06.088
I was going to tell you.
You're always so fucking perfect!

57:06.089 --> 57:06.945
You're so tied up with your work

57:06.976 --> 57:08.473
you don't see what's going on
around you anymore.

57:08.474 --> 57:10.863
The Vasilich family had nothing to do
with that murder.

57:10.864 --> 57:12.436
Blakely's murder is just a small part
of it.

57:12.437 --> 57:14.016
A small part of what?

57:14.723 --> 57:59.913
