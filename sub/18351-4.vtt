WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.136
So we've created
a trademark look
for each of you.I'm gonna be
a fake redhead?

00:03.136 --> 00:04.571
<i>All they're doing
is enhancing the color,</i>

00:04.571 --> 00:05.406
<i>and she just
started crying.</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:08.475
Take it off and come on.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.444
Krislian:
<i>I hate my hair.</i>

00:10.444 --> 00:12.813
This definitely is testing
my confidence.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.683
I asked you nicely
if you guys could
please shut down.

00:15.683 --> 00:19.353
Tash: <i>I have never
met one person</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:21.588
who knows how to play
that victim role

00:21.588 --> 00:23.023
<i>as well as
Courtney.</i>

00:23.023 --> 00:24.925
You were a ( bleep ).

00:24.925 --> 00:26.460
The girl who
is one step closer
to becoming

00:26.460 --> 00:29.095
"America's Next
Top Model" is...

00:29.095 --> 00:31.432
<i>Krislian.</i>

00:31.432 --> 00:33.267
I don't understand why

00:33.267 --> 00:34.468
they don't
see anything in me,

00:34.468 --> 00:36.436
because I am everything.

01:25.486 --> 01:30.090
Wow.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.659
<i>Totally
cannoli, y'all.</i>

01:31.659 --> 01:32.692
When Rita said that I got
best photo,

01:35.996 --> 01:38.799
I was pretty shocked.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.866
<i>And it was a pretty
amazing feeling.</i>

01:39.866 --> 01:42.335
I'm proud of you.

01:42.335 --> 01:43.637
Kinda feel like it looks
slightly alien-like.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.773
But it's dope.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.642
It's not really
causing good vibes
in the house,

01:48.642 --> 01:51.011
but for me personally,
I'm feeling great.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.112
There's some tension
between Courtney and I.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.483
She's got tactics.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.018
She really knows
how to make herself

01:58.018 --> 01:59.653
look like the victim
even though

01:59.653 --> 02:00.153
<i>she is an evil little
conniving thing herself.</i>

02:02.423 --> 02:04.291
I'm not trying to be
insensitive, Krislian,

02:07.260 --> 02:09.963
<i>but, like,
I'm really glad</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
<i>I was not bottom
two. So...</i>

02:11.465 --> 02:13.534
Think I'm gonna start,
like, dressing like a boy

02:13.534 --> 02:15.569
every time
I go to panel or something.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.937
<i>With the judges,
it's really hard</i>

02:16.937 --> 02:19.340
because they
have me typecast

02:19.340 --> 02:20.941
as this sexy Instagram
model, which I'm not.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.476
The only thing that I see
is sexy, though.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.280
<i>So my fear
is that we can't</i>

02:26.280 --> 02:27.815
go into the other realm
of editorial

02:27.815 --> 02:29.783
<i>and this and that.</i>

02:29.783 --> 02:30.918
I don't know
how to change it.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.186
It's such
a bad feeling.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.121
Yeah, it really,
really sucks.

02:34.121 --> 02:37.591
( phone ringing )

02:37.591 --> 02:40.994
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi, pretty baby.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.131
It's really, really,
really hard

02:44.131 --> 02:45.298
<i>to be away from
family and my friends.</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:47.167
...counting seconds.
I cannot wait.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.174
<i>I think I'm gonna be in LA
the end of September</i>

02:54.174 --> 02:55.609
<i>because the Drake/Future
concert is out there,</i>

02:55.609 --> 02:57.611
<i>and he has VIPs.</i>

02:57.611 --> 02:58.645
I feel like
my life is going on
without me.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.948
It's a horrible feeling.

03:01.948 --> 03:03.617
I'm gonna miss out
on everything.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.119
Oh, my God.
Ashley, by the way,
I have, like,

03:05.119 --> 03:06.820
the most
beautiful hair
right now.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.155
- You have no idea.
- <i>( gasps )</i>

03:08.155 --> 03:10.023
<i>Oh, my God.
Shut the--</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:11.491
- <i>Cory, I cannot.</i>
- Yeah.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.127
- <i>Is it blonde?</i>
- It's beautiful.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.196
I really, really
miss my friends.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.298
- I love you so much.
- <i>Oh, I love you so much.</i>

03:17.298 --> 03:18.198
- Be good, girl.
- <i>Bye.</i>

03:26.239 --> 03:31.311
Tatiana:
This Tiramisu's a good
lip liner, y'all.

03:31.311 --> 03:32.579
I literally go
in the Rimmel room,
like, every day.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.615
I mean,
it's so many cool

03:34.615 --> 03:35.750
<i>lip shades in there,
so many eyeliners.</i>

03:35.750 --> 03:38.151
<i>It's just insane.</i>

03:38.151 --> 03:38.919
<i>The London look
is legit.</i>

03:38.919 --> 03:41.322
<i>Rita alert!</i>

03:41.322 --> 03:42.789
<i>Hey, guys.
Rita alert.</i>

03:42.789 --> 03:44.024
Hi, ladies,
being a brand

03:47.194 --> 03:49.329
<i>is not only about
who you are,</i>

03:49.329 --> 03:51.131
<i>but how you present
yourself to the world.</i>

03:51.131 --> 03:52.500
Remember,
don't be a follower.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.002
Let them follow you.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.805
The social media
challenge.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.774
Giah:nThis week is gonna
be all about <i>social
media.</i>

04:00.774 --> 04:03.477
But it's kinda depressing

04:03.477 --> 04:04.978
coming in without
so many followers

04:04.978 --> 04:07.247
like the other girls,

04:07.247 --> 04:07.747
but I know that I know
how to take a good picture.

04:15.989 --> 04:20.294
- Hi ladies.
- All: Hey.

04:20.294 --> 04:23.964
Today is all about

04:23.964 --> 04:24.965
building your brand
through social media

04:24.965 --> 04:28.635
and apps like Snapchat.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.271
Tatiana:nSocial media is
super important <i>for models
nowadays,</i>

04:30.271 --> 04:32.940
because a photo of you
in an editorial magazine,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.108
it'll only reach
X amount of people.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.276
But photos that are online
and on social media,

04:36.276 --> 04:38.812
they reach the world.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.113
<i>The bigger and the better
that I am,</i>

04:40.113 --> 04:41.515
<i>the bigger and better
my brand is.</i>

04:41.515 --> 04:43.617
I want you to meet

04:43.617 --> 04:44.819
<i>someone whose
social media presence
has taken him</i>

04:44.819 --> 04:47.287
<i>to a whole new level.</i>

04:47.287 --> 04:48.956
He's a deejay,
a record label executive,

04:48.956 --> 04:50.957
and he's a master
of social media...

04:50.957 --> 04:53.193
- DJ Khaled!
- ( all screaming )

04:55.796 --> 04:57.297
Khaled has been
a significant figure,

05:00.167 --> 05:02.402
not only for me,
but an inspiration
for so many people.

05:02.402 --> 05:05.005
And you can tell,

05:05.005 --> 05:06.507
not only
by his following,

05:06.507 --> 05:08.275
but by how
he controls it.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.843
He's so smart.
I'm gonna let him
explain it himself.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.779
- Go ahead.
- Um, you know, I want

05:11.779 --> 05:13.246
to tell y'all today
how important it is

05:13.246 --> 05:14.848
to brand yourself
and to be self made.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.119
Social media
is a big thing.

05:18.119 --> 05:19.286
You know why it's a big thing?
'Cause we're in control of it.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.089
The key is

05:22.089 --> 05:23.424
is to put
a good message
out there.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.659
I'm great at Snapchat,
and I could tell you

05:25.659 --> 05:27.928
you can get a lot out
in ten seconds.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.596
You know,
I like taking pictures

05:29.596 --> 05:30.964
with the sun hittin' me.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.632
You know what I'm saying?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.134
And-- and I--
and I put a message...

05:34.134 --> 05:36.003
- "The sun
is shining on me."
- Mm-hmm.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.171
- "They can't stop me."
- They can't!

05:38.171 --> 05:39.907
"I will never quit."
You know what I'm saying?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.575
So you need to put
messages with your personality,

05:41.575 --> 05:43.944
with our beautiness,
and that's the key.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.080
All right,
so here's what
we're gonna do.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.748
You're gonna be
split into teams of two.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.116
<i>And you're gonna
hit the streets</i>

05:49.116 --> 05:51.017
to film one another
wearing Tezenis lingerie.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.622
<i>I'm not only
a model for this brand,</i>

05:55.622 --> 05:57.958
<i>I also design
for the brand,</i>

05:57.958 --> 05:59.459
<i>and it's the biggest
lingerie brand overseas.</i>

05:59.459 --> 06:01.862
As you know,
this is about finding a boss,

06:01.862 --> 06:04.131
someone who wins,
takes it to the next level,

06:04.131 --> 06:07.000
and you're gonna be fine
for the next 25, 30 years.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.969
<i>All right, so your team
will have 30 minutes</i>

06:08.969 --> 06:12.139
to film
a compelling story.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.742
And like Snapchat,
you have ten seconds.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.279
Krislian: <i>Social
media has definitely</i>

06:18.279 --> 06:20.080
<i>helped me with
my modeling career,</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:21.949
and that is one thing
that I'm really good at.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.850
<i>I have 50,000 followers
right now.</i>

06:23.850 --> 06:25.585
<i>I should have
the upper hand</i>

06:25.585 --> 06:26.786
in this challenge.

06:31.325 --> 06:35.863
That's the problem.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.364
I'm not supposed
to look sexy anymore.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.466
Sweetheart.
Sweet-- everybody,
how y'all doin'?

06:39.466 --> 06:41.969
How you doin'?
So listen.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.403
To be a superstar,
you have to be a superstar.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.307
The fans and the people
that's gonna support you,

06:47.307 --> 06:49.910
they have to be
connected with you.
They have to believe in you.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.512
We're superstars,
but the only way to do that
is to really be it, live it.

06:52.512 --> 06:56.784
- So are we all on
the same page?
- All: Yes.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.652
On three say "Major key."
One, two, three...

06:58.652 --> 07:00.120
- All: Major key.
- Let's go.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.622
We're right out here
into this main intersection.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.863
And then I have
like a little catchphrase.

07:09.863 --> 07:10.664
So we hit
the streets of New York
to take our snaps.

07:10.664 --> 07:14.167
Okay, ready?

07:14.167 --> 07:15.068
<i>Walking around
the streets of New York</i>

07:15.068 --> 07:16.603
with nothing
but lingerie on,

07:16.603 --> 07:18.672
<i>it's kinda fun.</i>

07:18.672 --> 07:19.907
Beautiful city,

07:19.907 --> 07:21.341
bold Tezenis designs,

07:21.341 --> 07:23.477
and one brilliant mind.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.178
Now that's a major key.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.180
Makes you feel like
a celebrity,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.982
and it kind of gets you
out of your head a little bit.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.784
Sometimes it's really fun
to transform in your lingerie,

07:30.784 --> 07:34.121
other times it's more fun

07:34.121 --> 07:35.155
to just be yourself.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.089
<i>Aah!</i>

07:37.858 --> 07:39.960
- I like that.
- I like that.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.295
- I like this one a lot.
- You said message.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.197
- Yeah, message and...
- She's on a scooter.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.798
- I don't know
where she found it.
- What I love this

07:44.798 --> 07:46.934
- is she's being herself.
- Yeah.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.069
Let's find a good
background and a good lighting.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.338
Well, no,
this is just
for practice.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.606
When I got assigned
with me and Courtney,
I felt good.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.642
How do we flip it around?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.277
I got you.
Say that part.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.812
No, remember?
How do we flip it around?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.013
But Courtney,
when she's frustrated,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.315
her attitude
just comes out.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.452
This is camera.

08:04.452 --> 08:06.587
But if you go to video,
it doesn't do it.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.787
We have 30 minutes.
So I feel like we did not
have enough time.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.523
We're running out
of time.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.292
So here we go.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.193
Beauty isn't defined
by the color of your skin.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.762
Right?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.263
Wait, this might not be
the right app.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.965
<i>The challenge,
it stressed me out,</i>

08:17.965 --> 08:20.167
and it was a big
hot mess.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.303
Girl, we don't have time.

08:22.303 --> 08:23.904
Let's do more and watch it later
when we've decided.

08:23.904 --> 08:26.273
My video isn't in here.
Give me a second.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.941
It's not?
Okay, let's check.
Let's check.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.476
Arguing with me
is not going to make this--

08:29.476 --> 08:30.611
- Let's check!
- You take the phone.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.978
I was doing
everything for you.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.916
What the ( bleep )
did you do for me?

08:35.916 --> 08:37.684
- I tried to get you to
speak. - Nothing, you
stupid-ass, bitch!

08:37.684 --> 08:40.186
- <i>( clatter )</i>
- Is everybody okay?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.455
- What happened? What
happened? - <i>She fell, she hit
her head</i>

08:42.455 --> 08:44.758
<i>and her back
and her arm.</i>

08:44.758 --> 08:45.926
I don't like anything
about it. I don't like the
story.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.995
I don't like
you at the bar.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.797
Everything looks cheap.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.830
I'm sorry.
I'm not impressed.

09:03.977 --> 09:08.816
Okay, let me record mine.
I can't do this.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.283
- Listen, okay?
- I can't-- I'm not...

09:10.283 --> 09:11.418
No, we're not
playing that game.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.187
Binta!

09:13.187 --> 09:14.988
Today's challenge
is creating a Snapchat story

09:14.988 --> 09:19.125
while wearing lingerie
in the streets of New York.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.662
- Give me a second.
- It's not?
Okay, let's check.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.030
Arguing with me
is not going to make it--

09:23.030 --> 09:23.931
- Let's check!
- You take the phone.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.699
That's a good thing.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.801
It was a big hot mess.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.736
I want you in my video.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.772
Okay, that's fine.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.474
The most important vessel
that you have

09:34.474 --> 09:36.977
is your body
and your mind.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.812
Be good to it.
Appreciate it.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.313
And if you don't,
they're gonna hate on it.

09:40.313 --> 09:43.150
I like the way
she worked the camera.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.751
- Yeah, the angle's great.
- You know, the angle's great,

09:44.751 --> 09:46.619
and then at
the end of the day,

09:46.619 --> 09:48.255
as she was being very bold
with a very bold statement.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.091
I think we should do it
how we had it last time

09:51.091 --> 09:52.292
where you were--

09:55.829 --> 10:00.334
Courtney was just
freaking out about everything

10:00.334 --> 10:04.004
instead of just
focusing on the product.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.474
Beauty isn't defined
by the color of your skin

10:06.474 --> 10:09.109
or the scars on your back.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.512
It's defined
by being beautiful

10:11.512 --> 10:13.247
in what
you already have

10:13.247 --> 10:14.981
<i>and loving each other
and your soul.</i>

10:14.981 --> 10:16.784
She's very confident here,
and at a time like this,

10:16.784 --> 10:19.987
we need to have
more messages like this.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.421
- Ready?
- Beauty is about power.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.658
Everyone is unique

10:24.658 --> 10:26.359
in Tezenis lingerie.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.096
One, two, three.

10:29.096 --> 10:29.863
In a dull world,
everybody needs a pop of color.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.632
Tezenis.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.834
- Tezam.
- Whoo!

10:34.834 --> 10:36.636
- Surprise.
- He's so handsome.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.972
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.607
New York city
is very intimidating.

10:40.607 --> 10:42.142
In LA, all you really need
to be is cute

10:42.142 --> 10:45.312
to be able to be invited
to fun things.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.814
<i>But, um, being here,
I'm like, oh, my God.</i>

10:46.814 --> 10:49.149
<i>I have to talk to people</i>

10:49.149 --> 10:50.917
and make an impression
on them and stuff.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.085
So, yeah,
I really miss my life
a lot in LA.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.988
So I have
small boobies,

10:54.988 --> 10:57.190
and I have
a small butt.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.959
But do you
still find me sexy?
Thanks, Tezenis.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.428
I don't like
that she stereotyped

11:01.428 --> 11:03.330
the small butt,
small boobs,

11:03.330 --> 11:04.498
because every body
is beautiful.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.468
Major key.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.503
Being a top model's
about way more than

11:09.503 --> 11:10.504
just having
a pretty face.

11:10.504 --> 11:12.606
It's about bossing up,

11:12.606 --> 11:13.907
owning it,
and glowing from
the inside out.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.809
Snapchat is one
social media outlet

11:15.809 --> 11:19.346
that I am still
trying to grasp.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.615
It isn't what you see,

11:21.615 --> 11:23.250
it's all about
what's underneath.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.686
I just want
a little more
confidence.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.954
<i>I want them to know
to be a superstar,</i>

11:26.954 --> 11:28.822
you can't act like
a superstar.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.591
- Right.
- We have to be a superstar.

11:30.591 --> 11:33.360
As someone
who lives in the city,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.795
you never really know
when you might have to disrobe.

11:34.795 --> 11:37.264
Tezenis lingerie
is for everyone.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.499
Kyle, she legit did
her story in two takes.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.471
And--
oh, ( bleep ).

11:43.471 --> 11:44.972
- Take it again.
- Yeah.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.807
Me, on the other hand,
I was so distracted 'cause

11:46.807 --> 11:49.243
I hear, like, the judges'
criticism in my head

11:49.243 --> 11:52.079
<i>that I'm too sexy.</i>

11:52.079 --> 11:53.613
In a city like New York,

11:53.613 --> 11:55.482
confidence is everything.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.418
When I wear Tezenis,
I feel empowered from it.

11:57.418 --> 12:00.421
<i>"Wear lingerie, Krislian,
but don't be sexy."</i>

12:00.421 --> 12:02.355
That's easier said
than done.

12:02.355 --> 12:02.923
So we've seen your videos.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.428
The winnerof this challenge

12:08.428 --> 12:09.863
is getting a great prize.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.665
You will be
featured as a model

12:11.665 --> 12:14.168
in an upcomingrunway show

12:14.168 --> 12:16.336
for Tezenis in Italy.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.638
The winner
of this challenge is...

12:21.108 --> 12:21.474
- Courtney.
- What?

12:25.345 --> 12:27.781
Shut the ( bleep ) up.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.316
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to cuss.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.985
You put a
message out there

12:31.985 --> 12:33.654
and you made me
not look at nothing else

12:33.654 --> 12:35.855
and accept your message.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.191
And you made me
almost shed a tear.

12:38.191 --> 12:38.792
Binta:
<i>I am pissed off because
the only reason</i>

12:41.862 --> 12:43.297
<i>she won that competitionis
because I was standing there</i>

12:43.297 --> 12:45.599
<i>and my skin tone
was in the video.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:47.935
I feel like
the message is not genuine

12:47.935 --> 12:50.170
based on what went on
behind the scenes.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.472
It's fraud.

12:56.577 --> 13:01.415
You guys,
when we get inside,

13:01.415 --> 13:02.483
we're gonna have
a little ice cream party
for the top 12.

13:02.483 --> 13:03.650
All: Yay.

13:05.819 --> 13:05.986
Binta:
<i>You.</i>

13:10.691 --> 13:12.593
You need to hear
what the ( bleep )
I'm saying...

13:12.593 --> 13:15.028
that will go outside,
make yourself look like
a good-ass person

13:15.028 --> 13:17.331
when you're hella ( bleep )
fake as ( bleep ).

13:17.331 --> 13:21.135
<i>Okay?</i>

13:21.135 --> 13:22.669
The reason you won
that ( bleep ) challenge

13:22.669 --> 13:24.605
<i>is because myself.
I was in that video.</i>

13:24.605 --> 13:25.973
- <i>So I'm telling you this...</i>
- Courtney:Really?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.608
Yeah.

13:27.608 --> 13:28.675
<i>Work on yourself.</i>

13:34.481 --> 13:39.186
Next photo shoot
I promise you.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.755
Best photo?
I'ma show you, okay?

13:41.755 --> 13:45.125
Courtney:
Jealousy is a horrible
emotion, girl.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.293
- Binta: <i>Jealousy, my
ass. I don't give a ( bleep
).</i> - It is jealousy.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.328
It is jealousy.

13:50.798 --> 13:55.135
I stood in ( bleep )
14 of your videos!

13:55.135 --> 13:57.837
- Lies! Lying! Lie!
- You didn't know how to stand.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.575
That is what--
that is the truth.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.110
From the first day
I saw Courtney, I saw, like,
a little evil in her.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.413
You were aggressive.
I was aggressive.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.747
We couldn't get along.
We couldn't agree.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.583
- Nothing--
- You're lyin'!

14:09.583 --> 14:11.285
- You're lyin'!
- Binta!

14:11.285 --> 14:12.786
Binta.
I don't know how you think
that you have

14:12.786 --> 14:15.021
the right to step in
and yell at me

14:15.021 --> 14:16.157
the way that you're doing
in front of everyone on the bus,

14:16.157 --> 14:18.425
but that's not okay.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.427
Seriously, like,

14:20.427 --> 14:21.795
there's a way
to come at people,

14:21.795 --> 14:23.296
and that wasn't
one of them.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.432
My ass!
You don't deserve it.

14:24.432 --> 14:26.199
You do not deserve it.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.668
I was being
a team player to you,

14:27.668 --> 14:29.970
but you were not being
a team player with me.

14:29.970 --> 14:33.073
- I was doing
everything for you.
- I tried to get you...

14:33.073 --> 14:33.506
What the ( bleep )
were you doing? Nothing,
you stupid-ass bitch!

14:35.575 --> 14:35.742
I can't wait until you
guys get eliminated.

14:40.748 --> 14:43.183
You know how
you're gonna look on TV,
so good luck with that.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.486
Today you shut me up.

15:03.003 --> 15:08.141
Tash:
Coming back from
the Snapchat challenge

15:08.141 --> 15:09.576
<i>Binta got really angry
and upset with Courtney,</i>

15:09.576 --> 15:10.744
And I'm like,
it's not just me.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.013
This girl's
frickin' crazy,

15:13.013 --> 15:14.681
and somebody else
notices it, too.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.017
It started off
very stressful, okay?

15:17.017 --> 15:19.186
And regardless,
we're not gonna agree
on how it went.

15:19.186 --> 15:23.156
But I'm telling you,

15:23.156 --> 15:24.624
if I hurt your feelings
and I snapped at you,

15:24.624 --> 15:27.027
- I am sorry.
- ...it was not genuine.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.128
She was just saying that
just to say that.

15:32.866 --> 15:37.638
<i>I really believe
in karma a lot</i>

15:37.638 --> 15:39.573
<i>and I know it's gonna
come back around.</i>

15:39.573 --> 15:41.575
Can you guys
please just stop?

15:41.575 --> 15:43.978
Tash:
You know this always
happens to you.

15:43.978 --> 15:45.779
You know how
you're gonna look on TV.
So good luck with that.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.014
I can't wait
until you guys
get eliminated

15:48.014 --> 15:51.352
because then
it's just gonna be
a huge karma thing.

15:51.352 --> 15:54.187
- It really is.
- Oh, no, baby.
We're here to stay.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.923
- You honestly think that?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

15:56.923 --> 15:59.426
<i>Do you honestly think that
with your attitude?</i>

15:59.426 --> 16:02.028
Paige:
Some people have been more
focused on fighting.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.364
It would be better to stay
focused while being here,

16:04.364 --> 16:07.501
because if you make
one mistake,

16:07.501 --> 16:10.337
you could be going home.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.939
Tash:
Like, I was not supposed to be
part of this at all today,

16:11.939 --> 16:13.507
but for some reason,
like, I'm in it.

16:13.507 --> 16:16.009
But you've been
getting yourself

16:16.009 --> 16:18.178
involved in everything
and that's what I'm saying,

16:18.178 --> 16:20.614
- is that that's not cool.
- I just looked at you,
and you didn't like it.

16:20.614 --> 16:22.249
I mean, you gotta deal
with people looking at you.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.018
- You're just so
- You don't even--
no, don't even say that.

16:24.018 --> 16:25.619
I'm done 'cause you--
you're gonna say things

16:25.619 --> 16:27.354
that you don't know
anything about?

16:27.354 --> 16:29.356
All right, it doesn't matter
'cause I'm switching rooms.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.690
<i>They wanna keep saying
these things, then fine.</i>

16:30.690 --> 16:33.026
<i>I'll win
this competition,</i>

16:33.026 --> 16:34.928
and then I'll have
all of you saying,

16:34.928 --> 16:35.362
"( bleep ),
I probably shoulda been
nice to her."

16:46.173 --> 16:50.811
- <i>( clatter )</i>
- Is everybody okay?

16:50.811 --> 16:53.747
- <i>Ugh!</i>
- Who is it?

16:53.747 --> 16:56.116
What happened?
What happened?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.451
I slipped and hit my head
and my back and my arm.

16:57.451 --> 17:00.354
- You guys.
- <i>Huh?</i>

17:00.354 --> 17:02.255
- Can I get some help?
- I'm coming.

17:02.255 --> 17:03.791
- You all right, Court?
- <i>Uh-uh.</i>

17:03.791 --> 17:06.359
She fell.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.594
She hit her head
and her back and her arm.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.495
Oh, ( bleep ).
Are you all right, babe?

17:08.495 --> 17:10.664
It hurts so bad.

17:10.664 --> 17:13.000
- Is it right here?
- Mostly my arm.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.468
- Which one? This one?
- This one, yeah.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.903
Don't touch it.
It's like really...

17:16.903 --> 17:18.338
- I see a scar.
- Where does it hurt?

17:18.338 --> 17:19.806
Something right here is red.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.508
Did you hit
your back right here?

17:21.508 --> 17:22.943
I have ice packs.
I have ice packs.

17:22.943 --> 17:27.448
Giah:
Courtney is a bit
of a baby.

17:27.448 --> 17:28.849
I fell down the stairs
two times already,

17:28.849 --> 17:31.084
and ain't nobody helped me
and ain't cry.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.254
And I ain't break my arm.

17:33.254 --> 17:35.021
I have an ice pack.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.523
Yo, if this
( bleep ) broken,

17:36.523 --> 17:37.491
I'm, like,
out of the competition.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.793
This sucks.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.128
<i>I feel like
she wants attention
from everybody</i>

17:41.128 --> 17:44.031
and anybody,
and it's not okay.

17:44.031 --> 17:46.767
Tash:
Courtney likes to play
the victim.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.836
<i>"I'm frail
and my back hurts."</i>

17:48.836 --> 17:50.437
<i>So she completely
deserved it.</i>

17:50.437 --> 17:52.606
Karma is a bitch.

17:52.606 --> 17:54.441
All right,
tell me if it's too tight.

17:54.441 --> 17:58.111
- Too tight?
- Ow.

17:58.111 --> 17:58.979
<i>It's pressing on
the bone right there
and it really hurts.</i>

18:05.352 --> 18:10.024
Hello, hello.
Come on in.

18:10.024 --> 18:13.293
- Welcome to our crib.
- I haven't been here yet.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.863
I just wanted
to introduce you to one
of my great friends

18:16.863 --> 18:19.766
and the editorial director
of "Paper Magazine,"

18:19.766 --> 18:21.702
- Mickey Boardman.
- ( cheering )

18:21.702 --> 18:24.805
Mr. Mickey.
I love Mr. Mickey.

18:24.805 --> 18:26.841
He's a such an
instrumental of "Paper,"

18:26.841 --> 18:29.276
so when he's in sight,
I'm just like, "Wow."

18:29.276 --> 18:31.078
Now, I got to turn it up
that extra notch.

18:31.078 --> 18:33.413
I'm so happy to meet you.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.348
I'm here to personally
invite you

18:34.348 --> 18:36.083
to the "Paper Magazine"

18:36.083 --> 18:37.518
Sexy Issue
VIP Party tonight.

18:37.518 --> 18:40.921
- Oh, my God!
- ( cheering )

18:40.921 --> 18:44.524
Tonight's gonna be
all about creating amazing
stories via photos.

18:45.659 --> 18:50.531
- And guess what.
- All: What?

18:50.531 --> 18:52.699
Tonight, you guys
are gonna be the stars.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.135
- ( cheering )
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:54.135 --> 18:56.270
Yes!

18:56.270 --> 18:57.671
Social media
is really important

18:57.671 --> 18:59.006
and those photos really
show your world

18:59.006 --> 19:01.475
to all of your followers.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.444
So after tonight's party

19:03.444 --> 19:05.479
you're gonna select
three images

19:05.479 --> 19:07.615
that best tell the
storyof the night.

19:07.615 --> 19:09.750
These images will be
judged at tomorrow's panel,

19:09.750 --> 19:13.187
so make sure that
you choose carefully.

19:13.187 --> 19:17.858
I'm immediately
just ecstatic

19:17.858 --> 19:20.160
because we have full
creative control over this
shoot.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.829
We are the photographers.
But it's also nerve-wracking,

19:21.829 --> 19:23.363
<i>because at panel,
if you go home,</i>

19:23.363 --> 19:25.366
it's completely
your fault.

19:25.366 --> 19:27.701
Now, there are
12 dresses on this rack

19:27.701 --> 19:29.136
<i>and there are 12 of you,
so make these dresses work
for yourself.</i>

19:29.136 --> 19:31.838
So we will see you
at the party.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.841
( cheering )

19:34.841 --> 19:38.445
- Yes!
- Got it.

19:38.445 --> 19:39.746
- Oh, it's nice.
- Gucci.

19:44.651 --> 19:50.023
Courtney snatches
the dress that I chose.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.292
Even-- I feel like
I have some scratch marks
on my arm from her.

19:52.292 --> 19:56.263
This is a competition.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.865
<i>When I go around
and I grab the dress</i>

19:57.865 --> 19:59.132
<i>and you say "That's
the dress that I want,"</i>

19:59.132 --> 20:02.603
I don't care.

20:02.603 --> 20:04.438
I think the one thing that
I'm getting from you a lot of

20:04.438 --> 20:07.340
is you're a complainer.

20:20.920 --> 20:25.992
So this shoot today
is to actually be
the photographer

20:25.992 --> 20:29.163
and take photos of things
at the "Paper Magazine" party.

20:29.163 --> 20:32.332
<i>Everyone's sees
"Paper Magazine"
on social media,</i>

20:32.332 --> 20:34.000
<i>so it's insane,
it's top-notch.</i>

20:34.000 --> 20:36.103
I was excited.

20:36.103 --> 20:37.604
<i>Rita alert!</i>

20:37.604 --> 20:40.841
Come on, girls.

20:40.841 --> 20:41.474
Hi, ladies.
So, are you guys excited
for tonight's "Paper" party?

20:43.911 --> 20:47.948
All: Yes.

20:47.948 --> 20:48.848
Tonight I want you
to focus on another element

20:48.848 --> 20:52.252
of social media,

20:52.252 --> 20:53.753
creating beautifully
curated photographs,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.357
and I'm sending over
the best person to help you.

20:56.357 --> 20:59.660
- What?
- She's an in demand model,

20:59.660 --> 21:02.663
and an expert at using
social media

21:02.663 --> 21:05.031
- to enhance her brand.
- No.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.267
She's been featured
in "Love Magazine,"
"British GQ."

21:06.267 --> 21:09.102
You're gonna
love her. Bye.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.838
( chattering )

21:11.838 --> 21:14.341
( cheering )

21:15.776 --> 21:17.344
My name is
Jasmine Sanders.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.516
I'm known as Golden Barbie

21:22.516 --> 21:23.817
<i>on social media.
I, at an early age,</i>

21:23.817 --> 21:27.521
<i>locked in that name</i>

21:27.521 --> 21:28.955
and started using that
towards my brand,

21:28.955 --> 21:31.692
just because
it's something fun.

21:31.692 --> 21:33.260
Krislian:
I've been following
Golden Barbie

21:33.260 --> 21:35.095
for a while
on social media.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.164
I love her.
She is so inspiring.

21:37.164 --> 21:39.600
<i>She is such
a great role model.</i>

21:39.600 --> 21:42.169
Social media has a huge play
in your career.

21:42.169 --> 21:46.106
<i>Key points-- you always,
always, always</i>

21:46.106 --> 21:48.609
<i>have to find
good lighting.</i>

21:48.609 --> 21:50.411
Find a great place
in your surroundings.

21:50.411 --> 21:51.445
You get to go
to beautiful places.
Show it off.

21:51.445 --> 21:55.115
<i>Get in your comments.</i>

21:55.115 --> 21:56.683
They want you
to interact with them.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.685
What about the bad
comments? That's what I'm scared
of.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.987
And my thing is,
don't ever entertain it.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.023
It will come
right back on you,

22:03.023 --> 22:04.625
and it will be attached
to your brand

22:04.625 --> 22:06.026
- for longer than you
want it to be.
- Right.

22:06.026 --> 22:08.796
Once it's on the Internet,
you're done.

22:08.796 --> 22:10.630
Courtney:
Golden Barbie told us to show
off your friends.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.933
Specifically for tonight,
she told us make sure

22:12.933 --> 22:15.335
your lighting is killer.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.004
That's about it
that I have for you.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.506
- Thank you.
- I was a bit jealous...

22:19.506 --> 22:20.674
Yeah?

22:23.577 --> 22:25.011
India:
<i>We're going to go to a VIP
"Paper Magazine" party.</i>

22:25.011 --> 22:28.582
I was super excited
about that.

22:28.582 --> 22:30.517
<i>I'm putting on this dress
and it's good, good,</i>

22:30.517 --> 22:31.652
<i>good, good, good,
until I get about halfway</i>

22:31.652 --> 22:33.854
and it's not even close.

22:33.854 --> 22:37.157
This dress is tiny.

22:37.157 --> 22:38.792
How am I gonna talk someone
into switching with me?

22:38.792 --> 22:42.462
<i>The first girl
I went to was Kris</i>

22:42.462 --> 22:43.530
because she had the big,
loose purple dress.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.167
Just, I can't, like,
really breathe.

22:50.437 --> 22:54.074
I almost feel like
I'm scared to wear this dress

22:54.074 --> 22:56.009
because it is really
short and revealing
and a little skimpy cut.

22:56.009 --> 22:58.846
- Yeah.
- Too sexy.

22:58.846 --> 23:01.181
I don't wanna go home.

23:01.181 --> 23:02.683
I've worked my butt off
to be here,

23:02.683 --> 23:04.351
<i>and her dress
is super tight and skinny</i>

23:04.351 --> 23:07.287
<i>which made me
really nervous,</i>

23:07.287 --> 23:08.188
but that is exactly why
I didn't grab it.

23:10.190 --> 23:10.423
It's too...
I can't wear it.

23:14.962 --> 23:18.032
Would one of you be able
to pin the dress for me?

23:18.032 --> 23:20.333
I don't have a safety pin,
but there has to be
somewhere here.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.504
I see that her dress
isn't fitting her well.

23:23.504 --> 23:26.173
<i>She has a bandage
on her arm,</i>

23:26.173 --> 23:28.175
and I am just
happy about it

23:28.175 --> 23:29.309
because I'm like, good,
karma's coming around.

23:47.161 --> 23:51.532
Man:
<i>Hello, hello.</i>

23:51.532 --> 23:53.433
- We are at a party!
- Hurray!

24:02.409 --> 24:06.614
You guys remember
Mr. Mickey.

24:06.614 --> 24:08.515
All: Yeah!

24:08.515 --> 24:11.418
I want you guys
to have lots of fun,

24:11.418 --> 24:13.320
but remember,
this is part of
the competition,

24:13.320 --> 24:14.821
so we're gonna be looking
at these pictures tomorrow.

24:16.156 --> 24:16.856
I'm gonna take something.

24:21.194 --> 24:22.496
So the story concept for
my three photos is a misfit

24:22.496 --> 24:26.266
who goes to
a "Paper Magazine" party.

24:26.266 --> 24:27.801
She's not really fitting
in, and then finally she finds

24:27.801 --> 24:30.637
the perfect crew
to hang out with.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.138
These two are
looking at me

24:32.138 --> 24:33.006
and I'm looking dead
into the camera.

24:33.006 --> 24:34.274
Have you got it?

24:37.344 --> 24:39.179
Oh, I love it!
I love it, I love it.

24:39.179 --> 24:41.148
I love it.
Thank you, thank you.

24:41.148 --> 24:41.982
Try to get
my attention, okay?

24:45.853 --> 24:48.289
The story, I titled it
"On The Prowl."

24:48.289 --> 24:50.791
I show up to the club,
I see these cute boys,

24:50.791 --> 24:55.095
and they happen to be twins,

24:55.095 --> 24:56.697
and I end up taking
them both home with me.

24:56.697 --> 24:59.967
I love it.
Got it? Okay.

24:59.967 --> 25:00.701
<i>I call myself "One Take
Jake," and now I can just
relax.</i>

25:00.701 --> 25:05.072
I killed it.

25:05.072 --> 25:05.939
I noticed that Tash
is hanging around

25:08.242 --> 25:11.177
<i>trying to join the party.</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:12.513
<i>Like, if you're not
taking it serious now,</i>

25:12.513 --> 25:14.782
<i>then you're not
in the competition</i>

25:14.782 --> 25:16.983
<i>for the right reason.</i>

25:16.983 --> 25:17.417
- Oh, Marissa!
- Does it work?

25:21.188 --> 25:25.259
( laughs )

25:25.259 --> 25:27.594
Boom!

25:27.594 --> 25:30.330
This literally looks
like a magazine spread.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.199
Yes! Thank you.

25:35.168 --> 25:35.235
Are you happy
with your angles?

25:39.940 --> 25:40.841
You're looking beau--
there you go.

25:40.841 --> 25:43.176
That one is good.

25:43.176 --> 25:43.743
Krislian: <i>There is
nothing the judges</i>

25:46.913 --> 25:48.415
<i>can tell me
that was too sexy.</i>

25:48.415 --> 25:50.016
<i>I wore the frumpiest dress
I could find.</i>

25:50.016 --> 25:52.319
I didn't do any sexy faces
in my pictures.

25:52.319 --> 25:55.622
I tried to do
as editorial as I could.

25:55.622 --> 25:58.992
I did the
complete opposite

25:58.992 --> 25:59.859
of what Krislian
would normally do.

26:03.297 --> 26:07.768
Now you have to go home
and choose those three photos

26:07.768 --> 26:10.170
that tell the story
of your night.

26:10.170 --> 26:11.472
- Yes.
- I will see you tomorrow.

26:11.472 --> 26:14.107
All: Whoo!

26:20.847 --> 26:25.819
Coryanne:
I'm always gonna be a little
nervous going into panel,

26:25.819 --> 26:28.488
but I think
if I exude confidence

26:28.488 --> 26:29.656
and I'm able to express
my message and my story,

26:29.656 --> 26:32.025
they're gonna like it.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.194
So it's that one for sure.

26:34.194 --> 26:35.696
<i>I'm not too worried. Always
confident, never cocky.</i>

26:35.696 --> 26:38.198
I'm not safe,
but I'm not feeling like
I'm going home.

26:38.198 --> 26:42.502
Man, it's just
really scary that someone's
gonna be sent home

26:42.502 --> 26:45.406
- from the cellphone
challenge.
- Yeah.

26:45.406 --> 26:47.140
And that's another thing
is, like, are we gonna be

26:47.140 --> 26:48.842
able to talk
and explain our stories?

26:48.842 --> 26:50.577
Or can you just
look at the pictures

26:50.577 --> 26:52.145
- and be like,
"Oh, this is a story."
- We'll be able to tell.

26:52.145 --> 26:54.682
Krislian:
<i>These last few panels</i>

26:54.682 --> 26:55.816
<i>have been especially
hard for me.</i>

26:55.816 --> 26:58.586
<i>I don't think I'm sexy.</i>

26:58.586 --> 27:00.320
<i>I'm competent.
Like, it's my career.</i>

27:00.320 --> 27:02.122
<i>It's my job to
be competent.</i>

27:02.122 --> 27:03.424
It's just, like,
really stressful.

27:03.424 --> 27:04.291
I don't wanna go home.

27:19.006 --> 27:23.577
- Hi, ladies.
- All: Hi.

27:23.577 --> 27:26.413
Let's say hello
to our amazing judges.

27:26.413 --> 27:28.849
Gorgeous super model
Ashley Graham.

27:28.849 --> 27:32.186
The image architect
to the stars, Law Roach.

27:32.186 --> 27:36.456
And our incredible
creative consultant

27:36.456 --> 27:38.024
and Chief Creative Officer
at "Paper Magazine,"

27:38.024 --> 27:40.694
Drew Elliott.

27:40.694 --> 27:42.362
The winner of ANTM
will receive $100,000

27:42.362 --> 27:45.466
and be featured in a commercial
thanks to Rimmel London.

27:45.466 --> 27:49.436
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

27:49.436 --> 27:51.472
in a fashion spread
with "Paper Magazine,"

27:51.472 --> 27:54.241
and one of you will get
an exclusive

27:54.241 --> 27:57.444
one year
talent deal with VH1.

27:57.444 --> 28:01.582
This week you learned all
about the power of social media.

28:01.582 --> 28:03.817
We sent you to a "Paper" party
where you played photographer

28:03.817 --> 28:06.754
and to capture your night.

28:06.754 --> 28:07.921
<i>Let's start and see
who told the best story.</i>

28:07.921 --> 28:10.257
<i>First up, Tatiana.</i>

28:10.257 --> 28:13.027
Let's take a look
at your picture.

28:13.027 --> 28:15.829
Law: <i>You get it.</i>

28:15.829 --> 28:17.130
You always look phenomenal.
You always have a great walk.

28:17.130 --> 28:20.200
Your hair is always right.

28:20.200 --> 28:21.702
You are a star
and I am in love with you.

28:21.702 --> 28:25.472
For me, overall,
this is a great photograph.

28:25.472 --> 28:27.440
<i>I mean, it's fun.
It's very cute.</i>

28:27.440 --> 28:28.442
<i>I'm always a bit dodgy about
not having myself in a
photo,</i>

28:28.442 --> 28:30.844
but that's just me.

28:30.844 --> 28:34.281
Okay, so next up, Giah.

28:34.281 --> 28:37.084
Ashley:
See, that's how you
lay on men.

28:37.084 --> 28:39.820
This looks fun.
This looks like
I wanna follow you.

28:39.820 --> 28:42.455
<i>This looks like I wanna be
part of your brand.</i>

28:42.455 --> 28:44.191
This looks like I'm waiting
for your EP to drop.

28:44.191 --> 28:45.426
- Giah, thank you so much.
- Thank you, guys.

28:45.426 --> 28:47.461
Thank y'all so much.

28:47.461 --> 28:50.163
- Paige.
- Hi, judges.

28:50.163 --> 28:53.267
Ashley:
Wow! This story
is so interesting.

28:53.267 --> 28:55.335
It's moody, it's cool.
You're edgy.

29:00.674 --> 29:02.609
I think this is fashion. This is
a great statement.And I love,
love, love your look for the
night.

29:02.609 --> 29:04.511
I love that I can't recognize
anybody else apart from you.

29:04.511 --> 29:06.847
<i>I mean, the blond stands out.
The lighting is perfect.</i>

29:06.847 --> 29:09.850
<i>You put the brand in there.
That's you.</i>

29:09.850 --> 29:11.652
Yeah, and to me it looks
like an editorial.

29:11.652 --> 29:14.688
<i>This is really,
really well done.</i>

29:14.688 --> 29:16.190
- It's fun.
- Congratulations, and you
have won me over this week.

29:16.190 --> 29:20.260
- Good job.
- Thank you.

29:20.260 --> 29:21.528
Rita:
<i>Cody, tell us your story.</i>

29:21.528 --> 29:24.498
Cody:
<i>I feel a lot of people</i>

29:24.498 --> 29:26.333
<i>act like they're the life of
the party all the time.</i>

29:26.333 --> 29:27.534
How can everyone be
the life of the party
at the same time?

29:27.534 --> 29:30.838
It just doesn't
make any sense to me.

29:30.838 --> 29:32.306
You just said to us,
"How can someone be the life
of the party?"

29:32.306 --> 29:34.908
That goes right along
with you being a twin,

29:34.908 --> 29:37.744
because you've never
had that moment.

29:37.744 --> 29:39.013
<i>We really need to start
playing this competition</i>

29:39.013 --> 29:42.649
as sole competitors.

29:42.649 --> 29:45.785
<i>So I want you to be
the life of the party.</i>

29:45.785 --> 29:50.290
That is what this challenge
and this photo shoot
was all about.

29:50.290 --> 29:54.161
When I'm selling lingerie,
when I'm selling my swimsuits
and my dresses,

29:54.161 --> 29:57.531
I am the life
of the party.

29:57.531 --> 29:59.666
<i>I'm always gonna look
like the life of the party
on my social media</i>

29:59.666 --> 30:01.669
because I want her to buy
into what I'm selling.

30:01.669 --> 30:05.006
Thank you.

30:05.006 --> 30:05.472
Rita:
<i>Binta.</i>

30:07.274 --> 30:10.244
<i>I love this.</i>

30:10.244 --> 30:13.446
<i>I love the angle.
I love your friend.</i>

30:13.446 --> 30:15.415
<i>I love that you just look
like you're not human,</i>

30:15.415 --> 30:18.585
<i>which is
incredible for me.</i>

30:18.585 --> 30:20.588
It's just cool.

30:20.588 --> 30:22.089
The way you stand
and the way you speak to us,

30:22.089 --> 30:23.691
it's just something
that's very posh,

30:23.691 --> 30:25.793
I wanna say, about you
that I enjoy watching.

30:25.793 --> 30:28.929
Thank you.

30:28.929 --> 30:31.665
Rita:
<i>Courtney.</i>

30:31.665 --> 30:33.700
<i>Drew, let's
start with you.</i>

30:33.700 --> 30:35.903
Drew: It's so hard with you
because you always hit it.

30:35.903 --> 30:36.970
You always do it.
You're always delivering
exactly what I want.

30:36.970 --> 30:40.341
Always, always.

30:40.341 --> 30:41.475
This first photo
is exactly what I wanted
everyone to do,

30:41.475 --> 30:44.644
and it's really,
really perfect.

30:44.644 --> 30:47.148
Even with my arm hurting
and my leg hurting,

30:47.148 --> 30:49.683
<i>I did deliver the photo.</i>

30:49.683 --> 30:51.619
I, like, actually
fell down the stairs,

30:51.619 --> 30:53.620
<i>and I used my arm
to kind of brace my fall,</i>

30:53.620 --> 30:56.957
so that I wouldn't hurt my back,
and I bruised my bone.

30:56.957 --> 30:59.460
Every single time
I've ever met you,

30:59.460 --> 31:01.361
<i>I hear something
is wrong with you.</i>

31:01.361 --> 31:03.530
You're a complainer.
You complain a lot.

31:03.530 --> 31:07.501
Your elbows always hurt,
you always have a cold,

31:07.501 --> 31:10.170
<i>you're in ailment mood
100% of the time.</i>

31:10.170 --> 31:14.408
Fix that, because
that's perfect, okay?

31:14.408 --> 31:17.511
So, I need that
to be fixed now.

31:17.511 --> 31:20.014
I was so excited
with the first picture,

31:20.014 --> 31:22.115
but by the end
I was bored.

31:22.115 --> 31:23.584
It was like,
you lost the story.

31:23.584 --> 31:25.019
You lost the fantasy.
You lost the excitement.

31:25.019 --> 31:26.987
I'm not hugely
impressed with that,

31:26.987 --> 31:29.422
but you did win
the challenge for me.

31:29.422 --> 31:31.925
That's all
I'm focusing on, okay?

31:31.925 --> 31:33.861
The photos?
I think you're amazing.

31:33.861 --> 31:36.697
I don't think
that's amazing.

31:36.697 --> 31:38.165
I think the first
photo is really cool,

31:38.165 --> 31:39.933
and I love that you have
a story to tell

31:39.933 --> 31:42.002
and take us through
Wonderland,

31:42.002 --> 31:44.805
but I think you really
could have been Alice.

31:44.805 --> 31:47.608
Okay, Courtney,
thank you, thank you.

31:47.608 --> 31:51.245
<i>Next up, Tash.</i>

31:51.245 --> 31:53.614
Ashley: I don't love it.
I think it's a little basic.

31:53.614 --> 31:57.084
I think you added
too many elements to it,
too many people.

31:57.084 --> 31:59.319
I think social media
and branding is really about
you, you, you.

31:59.319 --> 32:02.923
I don't like anything about it.
I don't like the story.

32:02.923 --> 32:05.025
<i>I don't like you at the bar.
Everything looks cheap.</i>

32:05.025 --> 32:08.194
I do like that last shot,
to be honest.

32:08.194 --> 32:09.363
It just looks like
it's the still from, like,
a movie or something.

32:09.363 --> 32:11.531
Thank you.

32:11.531 --> 32:14.034
- Marissa.
- Hi, cutie patootie.

32:14.034 --> 32:17.170
Ashley: To me, this story
is a model story.

32:17.170 --> 32:19.339
Like this is definitely
like what a model would post.

32:19.339 --> 32:22.943
It's fun.
I wanna be there with you.

32:22.943 --> 32:25.446
I think you could have
elevated it a little more.

32:25.446 --> 32:27.815
I wanna see the comments
I get from the photographer.

32:27.815 --> 32:31.351
"She's fun.
I love working with her.

32:31.351 --> 32:33.019
<i>She's up for anything." I
don't see up for anything.</i>

32:33.019 --> 32:34.789
I'm sorry.
I'm not impressed.
Thank you.

32:34.789 --> 32:38.325
<i>Okay, so next up, India.</i>

32:38.325 --> 32:40.861
<i>India, this just looks like
I wanna be part</i>

32:40.861 --> 32:42.796
<i>of your friend group.</i>

32:42.796 --> 32:44.364
Yeah. Party girl.

32:44.364 --> 32:46.199
One thing I really
wanted to see was that,

32:46.199 --> 32:47.834
you know, you guys could make
girls wanna be your friends,

32:47.834 --> 32:51.004
wanna be a part of this kind
of party that you're creating,

32:51.004 --> 32:54.308
and it just looks like
you didn't take yourself
too seriously. It's great.

32:54.308 --> 32:57.177
I have to say,
just from an Instagram
connoisseur, myself,

32:57.177 --> 33:02.349
I hate too many group shots.

33:02.349 --> 33:04.951
<i>I would have liked to see
just you in one photo,</i>

33:04.951 --> 33:07.488
<i>because you're
selling yourself--</i>

33:07.488 --> 33:09.623
the boss, the brand,
the business.

33:09.623 --> 33:11.024
At the end of the day,
this is what you're selling.

33:11.024 --> 33:13.861
This is what
you're selling.

33:13.861 --> 33:15.762
These might be
what you're selling.

33:15.762 --> 33:17.098
- <i>There should have been
one India.</i>
- Okay.

33:17.098 --> 33:18.699
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, guys.

33:18.699 --> 33:21.534
Rita: <i>Kyle.</i>

33:21.534 --> 33:22.168
<i>I like how proud you are of,
one, your sexuality,</i>

33:23.170 --> 33:27.975
<i>two, of your friends.</i>

33:27.975 --> 33:29.776
three, I like how
you are in charge.

33:29.776 --> 33:33.113
I don't care
for any of this.

33:33.113 --> 33:35.816
You above everyone else,

33:35.816 --> 33:38.185
probably have
the strongest brand,

33:38.185 --> 33:40.154
and this does not show me
that you have that brand

33:40.154 --> 33:44.357
that I know that you do.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.292
- Rita: <i>Thank you.</i>
- Yeah, thanks, guys.

33:45.292 --> 33:48.428
<i>Coryanne.</i>

33:48.428 --> 33:50.831
<i>I don't like that you
are giving other women</i>

33:50.831 --> 33:53.967
<i>in your photograph
attention.</i>

33:53.967 --> 33:55.636
I mean, I'm all for making it
look like I have friends

33:55.636 --> 33:58.272
and this is-- trust me--

33:58.272 --> 33:59.740
<i>but I feel like this
is very like,</i>

33:59.740 --> 34:01.609
"Can we take
a photo together?

34:01.609 --> 34:04.011
I see a super model

34:04.011 --> 34:05.745
and I see that there's
a diva inside you,

34:05.745 --> 34:08.182
but I don't see it
in this story.

34:08.182 --> 34:10.517
<i>I really want you
to stay focused</i>

34:10.517 --> 34:12.153
<i>because I feel like
there's something in you</i>

34:12.153 --> 34:14.121
<i>that could lose
focus very easily.</i>

34:14.121 --> 34:16.356
You're beautiful.
Stop hiding.

34:16.356 --> 34:17.992
Like, stop hiding
because you didn't know
how to do your hair.

34:17.992 --> 34:20.427
Stop hiding and taking
pictures with other girls.

34:20.427 --> 34:23.430
Like, it does you
a disservice.

34:23.430 --> 34:25.166
<i>Your look was so different
from everyone else's</i>

34:25.166 --> 34:27.101
that you could have really
stood out tonight.

34:27.101 --> 34:30.838
- Krislian.
- Ashley: You wanna start?

34:30.838 --> 34:34.140
I wanna start.
I wanna start!

34:34.140 --> 34:36.777
- Law gets to start.
- Why?

34:36.777 --> 34:39.646
No!

34:39.646 --> 34:41.748
I'm the host of the show!
It's not happening.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.150
- <i>You're not
taking the crown.</i>
- Drew: Okay, Law.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.352
- We have a history.
- No! I'm not--
you're not starting.

34:46.620 --> 34:51.491
Can I just say--

34:51.491 --> 34:52.158
can I just say that I would
literally buy everything

34:53.527 --> 34:58.365
- Everything.
- that is on this photograph?

34:58.365 --> 35:01.368
You went a whole other,
like, few levels up.

35:01.368 --> 35:04.271
Rita:
You should be so proud
of this challenge.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.974
Okay, I'm done.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.508
You know I've been very vocal
about the way I felt

35:08.508 --> 35:12.145
about you and your appearance,
and I just I wanna say,

35:12.145 --> 35:15.349
it's not because
I just don't like you.
It's tough love.

35:15.349 --> 35:18.018
<i>Because for me, each week
you have been the same girl</i>

35:18.018 --> 35:21.922
<i>that we saw in casting.</i>

35:21.922 --> 35:23.456
No matter what advice
we gave you,

35:23.456 --> 35:24.691
it's always been the same
look, the same walk, the same--

35:24.691 --> 35:27.928
today you shut me up.

35:27.928 --> 35:31.865
<i>You look amazing.</i>

35:31.865 --> 35:34.334
You know, last week you
were in the bottom two.
You nearly went home.

35:34.334 --> 35:37.504
And when we heard that this week
was all about social media,

35:37.504 --> 35:41.474
I thought it is going to be
sink or swim for her.

35:41.474 --> 35:44.845
Either we're going to see
catalog model cheese,

35:44.845 --> 35:47.781
or we're gonna see her
sell it and bring the brand,

35:47.781 --> 35:51.152
<i>and you did
a phenomenal job.</i>

35:51.152 --> 35:53.820
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

35:53.820 --> 35:58.091
Models, now we'll have
a little chat to decide

35:58.091 --> 36:00.694
<i>who will be
getting best photo</i>

36:00.694 --> 36:01.294
and who will be packing
their bags and leaving.

36:15.976 --> 36:21.014
All right, judges,
we have to decide

36:21.014 --> 36:22.649
<i>who did the best and who
did the worst this week.</i>

36:22.649 --> 36:25.819
<i>Let's start with Paige.</i>

36:25.819 --> 36:27.354
She definitely gave
an editorial moment.

36:27.354 --> 36:29.189
She fit into her haircut.

36:29.189 --> 36:30.991
She's, to me,
one of the top.

36:30.991 --> 36:32.426
Krislian, she really
came through.

36:32.426 --> 36:36.864
Thank God, this is
the Instagram challenge,

36:36.864 --> 36:38.365
because this is where
she shined.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.367
Yeah, I told you,
I told you, I told you.

36:40.367 --> 36:43.303
Knowing that I have
your guys' support,

36:43.303 --> 36:45.005
- like, honestly--
- Woman: <i>Oh, for sure.</i>

36:45.005 --> 36:46.840
you guys know
how devastated I--

36:46.840 --> 36:49.343
that's what
I even told them.

36:49.343 --> 36:50.778
I had Kyle's support.
Like, her energy--

36:50.778 --> 36:53.514
I was like,
"Your energy, seriously?"

36:53.514 --> 36:54.748
Kyle was like, "Babe."
I'm like really freaking out.

36:54.748 --> 36:57.818
She's holding my hand.

36:57.818 --> 36:59.320
"Kris, you've got this.
You've got this."

36:59.320 --> 37:00.854
Rita: <i>Let's talk
about the girls</i>

37:00.854 --> 37:01.689
<i>that didn't do
so well this week.</i>

37:01.689 --> 37:04.692
<i>Tash, Tash, Tash.</i>

37:04.692 --> 37:06.427
Tash's curation
on Instagram was horrible.

37:06.427 --> 37:09.963
The color of the dress,

37:09.963 --> 37:11.532
the random extras
that were in there.

37:11.532 --> 37:14.501
She made a very posh...

37:14.501 --> 37:18.839
sexy party...

37:18.839 --> 37:21.475
look like someone's
basement.

37:21.475 --> 37:23.977
It just didn't work.

37:23.977 --> 37:26.279
I'm so disappointed
this week.

37:26.279 --> 37:27.748
Rita: <i>Okay,
so what about Coryanne?</i>

37:27.748 --> 37:29.683
- What's going on?
- There's a disconnect.

37:29.683 --> 37:31.852
I don't know if she really
wants to be a model, honestly.

37:31.852 --> 37:34.921
<i>She does not have
what it takes to win</i>

37:34.921 --> 37:36.756
- "America's Next Top
Model." - She ain't got no
spunk.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.592
What do you think?
Have we decided?

37:38.592 --> 37:39.493
- Yep.
- I think so.

37:39.493 --> 37:41.127
Yes.

37:42.696 --> 37:47.701
Welcome back, ladies.
The judges have deliberated.

37:47.701 --> 37:51.472
If I call your name,
you'll be staying another week

37:51.472 --> 37:54.007
<i>to prove you have
what it takes</i>

37:54.007 --> 37:56.343
<i>to be the next Top Model.</i>

37:56.343 --> 37:57.911
The contestant with the best
photo this week was...

38:04.484 --> 38:09.356
<i>Krislian.</i>

38:09.356 --> 38:09.856
You really,
really blew us away.
Congratulations.

38:13.427 --> 38:15.962
Next.

38:17.364 --> 38:18.665
Binta.

38:21.334 --> 38:22.936
<i>Good job.</i>

38:25.239 --> 38:26.106
Paige.

38:28.809 --> 38:29.976
<i>Tatiana, good job.</i>

38:32.613 --> 38:34.314
<i>Giah.</i>

38:36.150 --> 38:37.017
<i>India.</i>

38:42.823 --> 38:47.127
Courtney. Marissa.

38:47.127 --> 38:50.997
<i>Kyle.</i>

38:50.997 --> 38:52.132
The next name
I'm about to call is Cody.

39:04.178 --> 39:07.914
Coryanne and Tash,
can you please step forward?

39:09.950 --> 39:10.784
Tash, between you
and your sister,

39:14.488 --> 39:18.025
<i>two may be too much.</i>

39:18.025 --> 39:19.960
<i>Your story looks like
you're just coasting along,</i>

39:19.960 --> 39:22.429
<i>and we're worried
you're just getting lost.</i>

39:22.429 --> 39:24.831
Even with an amazing new look,

39:24.831 --> 39:26.867
<i>you still can't seem
to pull yourself</i>

39:26.867 --> 39:29.503
<i>out of the middle
of the pack.</i>

39:29.503 --> 39:31.405
Coryanne, you've
been here before,

39:31.405 --> 39:34.275
and during this competition
you've been up and down.

39:34.275 --> 39:37.511
But this week, you're back
in the bottom two.

39:37.511 --> 39:41.348
The judges are nervous
that you can't be consistent.

39:41.348 --> 39:43.284
<i>And, unfortunately, it seems
your head is not in this
game.</i>

39:43.284 --> 39:48.021
You've really need to be
the best Coryanne

39:48.021 --> 39:49.289
that you can be,
because you're gorgeous.

39:51.592 --> 39:54.194
<i>Congratulations...</i>

39:58.598 --> 40:02.836
<i>Coryanne.</i>

40:02.836 --> 40:04.504
You made it another week,

40:07.474 --> 40:07.974
and you still have a chanceto
become the next Top Model.

40:09.309 --> 40:10.844
I'm going to miss you.

40:13.847 --> 40:15.649
- I'm so sorry, Tash.
- Thank you.

40:21.355 --> 40:25.459
I got to do things that I never
ever thought that I could do,

40:25.459 --> 40:28.762
and I got to do them
with my sister.

40:28.762 --> 40:30.698
<i>If Cody wins
this competition,</i>

40:30.698 --> 40:33.333
<i>I'll be so freaking
proud of her.</i>

40:33.333 --> 40:35.735
You deserve it.
You're a freaking
super star, girl.

40:35.735 --> 40:39.173
Don't cry.
So you better win this.

40:39.173 --> 40:43.810
<i>You better win it.</i>

40:43.810 --> 40:44.511
<i>And I want half
of the money.</i>

40:44.511 --> 40:46.780
And I love you.

40:46.780 --> 40:47.681
So you better take this.
You got it.

40:57.458 --> 41:02.262
I'm done with the whiners,
and I'm done with
the pity parties.

41:02.262 --> 41:05.032
It's driving me
a little bit freaking nuts.

41:05.032 --> 41:05.432
I'm going to take you
all into the world
of avant garde fashion.

41:11.237 --> 41:12.172
These shoes, I'm telling
you, I ain't lying when I say

41:16.077 --> 41:17.444
they couldn't even
stand on their own.

41:21.782 --> 41:26.286
The next name
I'm gonna call--

41:26.286 --> 41:28.154
I think we're
making a mistake.

41:30.290 --> 41:33.927
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
