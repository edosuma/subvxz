[car alarms blaring]DAVE: Earthquake!

00:09.096 --> 00:10.967
Earthquake, earthquake!

00:11.141 --> 00:12.795
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh,
my God. Are you okay, baby?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.405
Uh, I think so.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.103
Okay. Oh.Where's Dad?

00:16.277 --> 00:17.843
Earthquake! Earthquake!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.323
It's an earthquake!

00:21.195 --> 00:23.327
Stay calm. Stay calm.
Everything's okay.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.155
[sirens blaring]I gathered all our essentials.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.504
I got a air mattress.
Cell phones.

00:26.678 --> 00:27.766
I got my dream journal.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.073
You remembered
your dream journal,

00:30.247 --> 00:31.379
but you forgot your pants?

00:37.472 --> 00:38.908
Oh, hey.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.779
Good morning, everybody.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.567
Are you,
are you guys okay?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.831
Other than this coffee being
a little bitter, we're fine.

00:51.747 --> 00:52.791
Where's Malcolm and Marty?

00:52.922 --> 00:54.489
They're fine.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.273
They don't get out of bed
for anything under a 5.8.

00:56.447 --> 00:57.970
[scoffs]

00:58.145 --> 01:00.364
I can't believe you guys
are so calm about this.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.323
My heart is beating
out of my chest.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.802
Girl, we grew up here.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.804
We ain't new to this.
We true to this.

01:07.241 --> 01:08.546
I mean, the only reason
I got out of bed is

01:08.720 --> 01:10.983
to see which neighbor
slept naked.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.942
And I was right,
it was Dave.
Yeah.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.641
All right, so,
what do we do now?

01:16.815 --> 01:18.382
We pitch a tent so we don't
have to sleep inside tonight?

01:18.556 --> 01:21.820
Dave, I don't think a guy
that's wearing a welcome mat

01:21.994 --> 01:24.867
for pants should be talking
about pitching tents.

01:27.478 --> 01:28.958
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:29.132 --> 01:30.177
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

01:35.573 --> 01:38.707
Well, thanks so much for coming
on such short notice, Jackie.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.362
I mean, these cracks
look pretty nasty.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.755
For the owner of
Tina-licious Cakes? No problem.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.106
I accept cash, credit
and red velvet cupcakes.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.411
[laughing]

01:47.585 --> 01:49.979
Well, there's not much to do.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.286
I mean, this house is
rock-solid, you know?

01:55.941 --> 01:58.292
Well, technically,
that's not a part of the house.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.773
Well, I'm just hoping
for a big enough aftershock

02:01.947 --> 02:04.515
So I can finally get
my open concept kitchen.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.996
Ha. I wouldn't bet on it.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.172
I mean, we rode out
the big one in '94

02:09.346 --> 02:10.391
with no problem.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.349
This house is like me.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.656
They just don't build 'em
like this anymore.

02:14.830 --> 02:15.961
You know?

02:19.008 --> 02:20.966
Calvin,
the Lord has spoken,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.012
and He said
it's time to remodel.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.971
Even the Bible got
a New Testament.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.191
Oh.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.802
So, which color would you like
for our new walls?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.587
I like this one.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.545
Well,
that's the color it is now.

02:34.676 --> 02:35.677
Exactly.

02:37.113 --> 02:39.115
Come on, baby, let's take this
as an opportunity

02:39.246 --> 02:41.204
to just update some things.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.033
Okay, you know what?
We'll get an 85-inch TV.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.557
It'll hide all the cracks.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.125
Nice try. No.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.694
Oh, hey, you two.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.043
Are my babies okay?

02:54.217 --> 02:55.610
Yeah, we're all right.

02:55.784 --> 02:56.915
Our house did get
a little bit of damage,

02:57.046 --> 02:58.569
but we're not worried.

02:58.700 --> 02:59.570
We're renters.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.921
Uh, speaking of,

03:03.095 --> 03:05.315
there is a-a hole
in the wall

03:05.489 --> 03:07.099
that looks like somebody flew
a drone into it,

03:07.274 --> 03:08.536
but it was definitely
from the earthquake.

03:10.364 --> 03:11.930
Well, this is
a pretty big job.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.845
Uh, you might want
to check into a hotel.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.456
We'll stay at our hotel.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.675
[scoffs] What do you mean,
"your hotel?"

03:17.849 --> 03:19.155
The one next door.

03:20.156 --> 03:21.288
Oh, no.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.160
Oh, yes.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.727
I mean, the staff
treats you like family,

03:25.901 --> 03:26.945
because they are family.

03:28.599 --> 03:31.646
And the place feels like yours,
because it is yours.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.177
Hey, buddy.
What do you got there?

03:41.308 --> 03:43.048
My clothes.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.876
Figured we'd ship everything
else back to Michigan.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.313
I'd like to leave
this afternoon.

03:47.749 --> 03:48.924
Wha...

03:49.098 --> 03:51.274
I thought you loved California.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.755
Well, that was before I knew
it was a death trap.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.411
All right, buddy, come on.
Sit down, look.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.414
We're all gonna be fine.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.067
Okay?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.896
[whispers]:
He's not wrong.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.075
There is no need to worry,
honey.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.990
We just have to be prepared,

04:12.121 --> 04:14.732
which is why I bought us this.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.692
Everything we need to
prepare for another quake:

04:17.866 --> 04:20.521
protein bars,
water pouches, a flashlight,

04:20.695 --> 04:23.654
even this adorable
fire extinguisher

04:23.785 --> 04:26.309
that looks like our regular
fire extinguisher's baby.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.269
Fine. I'll go unpack.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.446
And pray for baby fires.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.496
Wow, Grover's really
freaked out.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.411
Well, yeah,
it makes sense.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.021
I mean, I could see
how last night would be

04:43.195 --> 04:44.936
totally terrifying
for a child.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.373
[rumbling]Aftershock!

04:46.547 --> 04:47.591
Uh-oh.

04:48.810 --> 04:51.160
That was the
garbage truck, Dave.

Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.559

04:58.733 --> 04:59.734
Nah, you know what?
Best out of 17.

04:59.908 --> 05:01.301
Oh, no way, man.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.215
No way. You lost.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.478
Mom and Dad are taking
your room.

05:04.608 --> 05:05.783
What? No, hell nah, man.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.481
Let's wrestle for it.What? Aah!

05:11.963 --> 05:12.964
I'm-a drop you.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.183
I don't know what you're doing,

05:14.357 --> 05:15.924
but you're too old
to be doing it.

05:16.054 --> 05:16.838
Put him down.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.232
[chuckles]:
Oh, uh... Hey.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.061
We-we were just wrestling over
who gets to give you their room.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.933
And luckily, Malcolm won.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.151
Ah, what? No, man.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.589
I mean, uh...
[chuckles] Yeah.

05:28.763 --> 05:29.851
All I do is win.Ow.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.071
Uh, Mom, Dad,

05:33.202 --> 05:34.725
make yourselves at home.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.597
Mi casa es
quite literally su casa

05:36.771 --> 05:37.989
because we rent from you.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.644
Well, it's freezing in here.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.081
Marty, what the hell happened
to my thermostat?

05:43.255 --> 05:44.822
That's a new system I put in.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.694
You can control the temperature
from your phone.

05:46.868 --> 05:47.869
Fancy, right?

05:47.999 --> 05:50.045
Oh, very fancy.

05:50.219 --> 05:51.742
Now tell your phone I'm cold.

05:51.873 --> 05:53.701
And tell your brother
I'm raising the rent.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.662
Oh, uh, Ma,
you did not have to go shopping.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.403
We do have food.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.449
You have dino nuggets
and soy sauce packets.

06:04.668 --> 06:08.629
And this bottle of ranch is old
enough to have voted for Obama.

06:11.109 --> 06:13.547
I'm not gonna spend the next
three weeks eating condiments.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.114
I'm about to smoke this chicken.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.290
Uh, Ma, it is 9:30
in the morning.

06:18.465 --> 06:20.031
Well, I'm also gonna
make hash browns.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.564
Oh, okay. So, I guess

06:30.694 --> 06:32.740
that charge from Home Depot
wasn't fraudulent.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.005
You can't put a price
on preparedness.

06:37.135 --> 06:37.962
[chuckles]:
Oh, apparently you can,

06:38.136 --> 06:39.834
and it's $1,300.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.360
Well, you know,
your little earthquake kit

06:44.534 --> 06:46.362
needed some help, so I got
everything we would need

06:46.536 --> 06:47.407
in case of a flood,
mudslide,

06:47.581 --> 06:50.061
and a biological weapons attack.

06:51.802 --> 06:54.065
What is that for?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.460
[chuckles]
It's for beekeeping, Grover.

06:57.591 --> 06:58.940
[whispers]:
Methane leaks.All right.

07:01.899 --> 07:04.728
Don't worry, honey. Your dad
just went a little overboard.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.295
I don't think
he went overboard enough.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.123
An earthquake

07:08.297 --> 07:11.648
once made the Mississippi River
flow backwards.

07:15.696 --> 07:17.698
Dave,
you've got to tone it down.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.743
I know you're
freaked out, but...I am not freaked out.

07:19.917 --> 07:20.962
Okay.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.314
What is wrong
with being prepared?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.751
Nothing.
But you're still returning

07:27.925 --> 07:29.449
the gas mask and the generator.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.539
Fine.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.326
Can't return it

07:37.500 --> 07:40.068
if I can't find the receipt.

CALVIN:
Tina!

07:45.682 --> 07:46.988
Yeah, baby?

07:47.162 --> 07:47.989
I can see the
construction dumpster

07:48.119 --> 07:49.512
from the window.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.992
Looks like half the
house is in there.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.342
We never should have hired
that contractor.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.648
Is it because she's a woman?

07:54.778 --> 07:56.606
I don't see gender, Tina.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.913
All I see is somebody
ripping up my house.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.045
Hey. Hey, Pop,
Pop, hold up.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.307
Is that my iPad?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.092
Oh, yeah. And by the way,

08:04.222 --> 08:06.224
some girl named
"Jennifer Cheesecake Factory"

08:06.398 --> 08:09.227
sent you some pictures her mama
would not be happy with.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.753
Don't bring her home.

08:17.105 --> 08:18.454
[hammers pounding][drill whirring]

08:18.628 --> 08:21.283
What the hell
is going on in here?

08:21.457 --> 08:23.807
They're just doing repairs.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.461
This is
what we talked about.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
No, we talked about paint.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.683
Last time I checked,
you don't need

08:29.813 --> 08:31.772
a sledgehammer to paint.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.600
Oh, hey, it's the Butlers.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.036
Oh, good, you're here.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.690
Just in time for me to fire you.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.868
Fire her?
I thought we agreed

08:41.042 --> 08:43.392
to fix whatever needed
to be fixed to make it safe.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.960
That wall is wobbly
and exposed.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.049
Well, so is Miss Kim.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.138
You don't see nobody trying
to throw her in the dumpster.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.794
You know what?
I'll finish the repairs myself.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.578
I just need some sandpaper,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.232
a few screws and a...

08:57.406 --> 08:58.407
and a little Spackle.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.627
We're missing a wall.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.588
Okay, a lot of Spackle.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.984
All right, uh, Jackie,
why don't you and the crew

09:10.158 --> 09:12.639
go home for the rest of the day,
and I'll have a talk with him.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.032
Come on, guys!

09:15.206 --> 09:17.774
Whoever said he'd fire
us after three days,

I owe you a beer.

you are being ridiculous.

You're so busy at the shop,

09:26.566 --> 09:28.306
these repairs
will take you forever,

09:28.480 --> 09:30.961
and I'll be moving back
into this house in a wheelchair.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.573
Then I'll be sure
to add a ramp to my quote.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.010
Fine.

09:36.184 --> 09:37.185
If you think
that you can do it better,

09:37.315 --> 09:38.316
then have at it.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.536
And have at it I will.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.799

in three days!

10:11.219 --> 10:14.091
Uh, you know, I was hoping
that I could watch the game.

10:14.265 --> 10:17.051
Oh, sorry, man.
This is the reunion episode,

10:17.225 --> 10:19.488
and that's when
all the tea gets spilled.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.099
And I have had a day.

10:22.230 --> 10:25.146
Your father lost his damn mind
and fired our contractor,

10:25.320 --> 10:28.192
so looks like we gonna be
living here another six months.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.676
Did you say "six months"?

10:33.807 --> 10:36.679
[chuckles]
Uh, Marty, can I speak to you

10:36.810 --> 10:38.028
in the kitchen,
please, my brother?

10:38.159 --> 10:39.377
Oh, not now, man,
Svetlana just threw

10:39.551 --> 10:41.075
her passport in Gabe's face.

10:41.249 --> 10:42.598
[chuckles]

10:47.081 --> 10:49.779
Now, you listen to me.
I cannot take this anymore.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.303
We have got to get Mom and Pop
the hell out of here.

10:52.477 --> 10:54.697
You want to turn our parents
out on the street?

10:54.828 --> 10:57.352
The people who gave us life?
Who raised us?

10:57.526 --> 10:58.614
You don't want Mama to leave

10:58.745 --> 11:00.311
because she is
doing your laundry.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.270
Okay, man, she folded
the fitted sheets,

11:02.400 --> 11:04.185
Oh, man.It's basically witchcraft.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.622
Look, the only witchcraft
she is working

11:06.796 --> 11:09.320
is making my dates
disappear from this house.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.713
All right, I think
you're pretty good

11:10.844 --> 11:12.584
at making them disappear
all on your own.

11:12.759 --> 11:13.063
Oh, please...You can't blame Mommy
for that, I'm just saying.

11:13.237 --> 11:14.891
[alarm sounding]

11:20.157 --> 11:21.245
[alarm stops]

11:21.419 --> 11:22.943
Earthquake.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.336
An earthquake is happening.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.774
What is going on?

11:27.948 --> 11:29.732
Gemma, you're not
wearing any shoes.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.907
[buzzer sounds]

11:31.081 --> 11:33.780
First earthquake drill demerit.

11:33.954 --> 11:36.783
Drill? We never
agreed to a drill.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.829
Do you think Mother Nature
sends a written invitation

11:40.003 --> 11:42.136
before she opens a sinkhole
in your yard?

11:42.310 --> 11:44.399
A sinkhole?

11:44.573 --> 11:47.532
Yes, that's right, Grover.
A sinkhole.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.363
Now, everyone,
find the safest exit.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.583
Uh, the front door?

11:54.757 --> 11:56.585
Rookie mistake.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.805
[buzzer sounds]

12:00.763 --> 12:02.591
What...

12:02.765 --> 12:06.769
You would have been crushed
by all of this literature.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.554
Okay, this drill is over.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.340
Okay, fine. But...

12:12.470 --> 12:15.952
based on everyone's performance,
I can't guarantee

12:16.126 --> 12:19.608
that we would all survive
the next big one.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.610
Dad, you are a very loud
whisperer.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.396
I'm sleeping in the yard.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.921
Uh-- Very good, son.

12:28.051 --> 12:31.011
The back door
is the safest egress.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.709
Just be careful
of any fallen power lines.

12:33.883 --> 12:37.060
Dave, this has to stop.
Grover is totally freaked out.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.367
Well, I'm doing this
so he won't be scared.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.761
So he won't be scared
or you won't be scared?

12:41.935 --> 12:43.937
[alarm sounding]

12:45.460 --> 12:46.853
[alarm stops]

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
Sorry, my, my finger slipped.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.077
Look, this is how I'm coping.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.514
Okay? If anything
ever happened to you guys...

12:56.688 --> 12:58.429
I would never be able
to forgive myself.

12:58.603 --> 13:01.476
Honey, I appreciate that.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.261
And of course we
should be prepared,

13:04.435 --> 13:06.394
but you've got our
son in the backyard

13:06.524 --> 13:09.614
rationing gummy bears
like it's the end of days.

13:11.965 --> 13:14.402
In retrospect, uh,

13:14.532 --> 13:17.187
maybe I did go
a little overboard.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
You think?

13:21.148 --> 13:22.802
You need to go out there
and let Grover know

13:22.976 --> 13:24.325
that everything's
gonna be okay.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.416
Oh, uh, don't go
to the bathroom.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.854
I may or may not have tried
to simulate a water main break.

13:33.421 --> 13:35.292
TINA:
Oh!

13:35.466 --> 13:37.512
Calvin, that better be you.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.645
'Cause if it's not, whoever
it is is getting this bat!

13:40.820 --> 13:42.691
It's me. I-It's me, baby.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.433
Baby, what are you doing
in there?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.783
Well, right now, I'm just trying
to remember the last time

13:47.914 --> 13:50.742
I had a tetanus shot.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.745
Well, I know it's been
too long. Get out of there.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.486
Look, bae, I just needed
to make sure

13:55.660 --> 13:57.749
everything in the trash
was trash.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.361
I didn't agree
to tear the whole house down.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.058
We're not tearing
the house down.

14:02.232 --> 14:04.887
We just had to change
some things.

14:05.018 --> 14:08.499
Well, you know the saying,
"Change is bad"?

14:08.673 --> 14:10.458
That's not the saying.

14:10.588 --> 14:11.502
Well, it should be.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.725
This dumpster's just filled with
memories I don't want to lose.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.336
Did you see this
wall they tore out?

14:19.467 --> 14:22.470
It's got the comic strip that
Malcolm and Marty drew on.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.211
Remember we were so mad,
but then, eventually,

14:24.385 --> 14:25.386
it grew on us?

14:25.516 --> 14:26.474
Yeah.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.824
That was pretty cute.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.609
All this stuff, babe, this is
what makes our house a home.

14:31.783 --> 14:36.049
Baby, we are what makes
a house a home.

14:36.223 --> 14:39.530
These memories are precious,
but it's time for new ones.

14:39.704 --> 14:42.011
The boys are grown,
we have the money.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.795
And we're in a new phase
in our lives,

14:43.970 --> 14:46.189
and that phase includes
dual showerheads.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.846
Two showerheads? Who needs that?

14:50.977 --> 14:53.109
The couple who showers together.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.985
Well, this could be
an interesting new phase.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.073
[laughs]

15:01.857 --> 15:04.120
Calvin, we love
this neighborhood.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.167
And we have the chance
to turn this house

15:07.341 --> 15:09.038
into the dream home
we always wanted.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.345
Yeah.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.304
It's just hard
letting it all go.

15:15.740 --> 15:16.872
You know, we don't have to.

15:17.003 --> 15:20.006
All right?
Why don't we take this piece

15:20.180 --> 15:21.311
and have it framed?

15:21.485 --> 15:23.139
Good idea.
See?

15:23.313 --> 15:24.488
Uh, b-babe, uh...

15:24.662 --> 15:25.925
Can we save this, too?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.754
It's the first light switch
I had to fix.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.452
Let it go.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.238
Fine.

15:35.412 --> 15:38.285
I'll call Jackie in the morning
and unfire her.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.808
I already did.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.115
Good, because God didn't intend

15:42.245 --> 15:44.682
for three adult men
to share one bathroom.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
Hey, buddy.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.733
I brought you
some emergency hot cocoa.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.823
Speaking of hot,

15:54.997 --> 15:57.739
did you know that L.A.
sits on the Ring of Fire?

15:59.349 --> 16:02.962
We are literally living
on a volcano.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.269
They didn't mention that
on Zillow.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.229
Come on, buddy.
[sighs]

16:09.403 --> 16:11.405
Sit down. Listen...

16:13.015 --> 16:15.235
I'm sorry I scared you.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.019
I went totally overboard
with the earthquake prep.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.848
No, you didn't.
We need all that stuff.

16:20.022 --> 16:23.504
Are you aware that this area
is prone to radon leaks?

16:26.507 --> 16:29.466
No, I did not know that.

16:29.640 --> 16:32.252
But no more Wikipedia
for you before bed.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.256
But I get it.

16:36.386 --> 16:39.085
You know, feeling prepared
makes me feel less afraid, too.

16:39.259 --> 16:40.869
I didn't know you got scared.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.958
Oh, well, I hide it very well.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.658
Of course I do.
Look, everybody does.

16:47.832 --> 16:48.964
But that doesn't mean
we should run away

16:49.095 --> 16:51.271
from the things
that are scaring us.

16:51.401 --> 16:54.448
And besides, natural
disasters happen everywhere,

16:54.622 --> 16:56.537
even Michigan.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.105
I know.

16:59.279 --> 17:04.023
Fun fact, in 1965,
Michigan had 12 tornadoes.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.198
In one day.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.332
Well, I'm glad we moved.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.728
Look, the point is,

17:13.902 --> 17:16.035
Mom and I are never gonna
let anything happen to you.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.168
You know, and we live
in a neighborhood

17:19.342 --> 17:20.822
filled with people
who have our backs,

17:20.996 --> 17:24.347
so no matter what happens,

17:24.521 --> 17:26.132
we're gonna be okay.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.482
I do love it here.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.049
Malcolm and Marty
promised they'd take me

17:30.223 --> 17:31.485
to the horse track.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.229
Well, that's something
we'll talk about.

17:40.494 --> 17:43.540
[humming]
Ma!

17:43.714 --> 17:45.151
What are you doing in here?

17:45.325 --> 17:47.066
Brushing my hair.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.939
There better be
some hot water left.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.202
I need some privacy, people!

17:55.552 --> 17:57.511
Boy, ain't nobody looking
at you. Get on out of there.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.775
Ah.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.951
Have you gained some weight?

18:04.083 --> 18:07.086
No, Mother, I have not.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.132
I blame you and your
smoked chickens. [laughs]

18:11.177 --> 18:12.700
[whimpers]

18:12.874 --> 18:14.528
Aw, bae.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.487
I'll be glad when
our renovations are done.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.142
These single showerheads,
they're just so old-school.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.280
Mama and Dad have got to go.

18:28.933 --> 18:29.717
Oh, was it the bathroom party

18:29.891 --> 18:31.197
that changed your mind?

18:31.371 --> 18:33.199
[muttering]

18:33.373 --> 18:35.201
Hey, boys.
Ah...

18:35.375 --> 18:37.072
Well, since the contractor
will be finished next week,

18:37.203 --> 18:39.161
we decided to
treat ourselves

18:39.292 --> 18:41.337
and spend our last few
days in a nice hotel.

18:41.511 --> 18:43.600
Oh, really? Well, oh, gosh,

18:43.774 --> 18:45.428
it's been so lovely
having y'all here.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.300
Yeah, yeah. I-I wish you guys

18:47.430 --> 18:48.866
could've stayed longer.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.259
It really just flew by.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.653
Not to me.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.223
Hello.

18:59.877 --> 19:00.791
Why are you wet?

19:00.965 --> 19:04.099
Funny story.
[chuckles]

19:04.273 --> 19:06.797
Jimmy was laying a little
conduit for the electrical...

19:06.971 --> 19:08.321
Water. Get to the water.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.061
Right.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.238
Uh, well, then we found
some termite damage.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.849
And, it turns out,
when we pulled out the wood,

19:15.023 --> 19:16.677
it was the only thing
holding up your pipes.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.769
How much and how long?

19:21.899 --> 19:24.337
Six weeks, and I'll email you
the quote

19:24.467 --> 19:25.338
because I don't want
to say it to your face.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.557
[sighs]

19:29.124 --> 19:32.606
Lord of Light, what have
we done to deserve this?

19:32.780 --> 19:34.782
Well, it ain't no pleasure
cruise for me, either.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.827
You think I like
living with dude smell?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.352
Uh-- Look,

19:39.482 --> 19:41.136
if y'all gonna be
staying here for that long,

19:41.310 --> 19:43.007
then we need to set down
some ground rules.Yeah.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.749
To make your stay
much more comfortable.

19:47.229 --> 19:49.144
Where are you going, baby?

19:49.318 --> 19:52.365
I need a break. I'm-a go sit
by the pool in my living room.
