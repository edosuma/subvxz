32:52.306 --> 32:53.640
- What a [bleep].

32:53.707 --> 32:55.342
- Yo, that's fighting words.

32:55.409 --> 32:57.444
- What if
he's trying to strategize,

32:57.511 --> 32:59.213
so then we tell Mike
what he's saying to try

32:59.279 --> 33:01.882
and get Mike all in his head?

33:01.949 --> 33:03.217
- I don't usually focus on--

33:03.283 --> 33:04.818
- All you see
is the finish line.

33:04.885 --> 33:07.487
- Yeah, I don't focus on what's
going on around me usually.

33:07.554 --> 33:08.956
- You think he plays
a long time, or no?

33:09.022 --> 33:10.123
- Cutler?
- Yeah.

33:10.190 --> 33:11.825
- I don't know.
- He's an athlete.

33:11.892 --> 33:13.260
- Mike's an athlete.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.229
- How?

33:15.295 --> 33:16.563
- I'm obviously going to win.

33:16.630 --> 33:17.931
Positive vibes only.

33:17.998 --> 33:19.666
- Mike's not only
going up against him.

33:19.733 --> 33:23.036
There's, like,
seven other teams.

33:23.103 --> 33:24.705
- I forgot to tell you
one more thing.

33:24.771 --> 33:25.939
- Oh, my God.

33:26.006 --> 33:28.108
- So I went on Twitter,
and I followed

33:28.175 --> 33:29.676
every person that's playing.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.745
All guys
started following me back.

33:31.812 --> 33:34.681
So I started
private messaging them.

33:34.748 --> 33:35.916
- Oh, my God.

33:37.184 --> 33:38.552
So you're trying
to bang all these guys?

33:38.619 --> 33:40.420
- No, I'm just
trying to help Mike.

33:40.487 --> 33:41.488
- I'm going to speak it
into existence.

33:41.555 --> 33:42.623
- You're going to win.

33:42.689 --> 33:43.757
- You came
to defend your title.

33:43.824 --> 33:45.025
You came here to win.
- Exactly.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.527
<i>- Right now,</i>
<i>I feel really good.</i>

33:46.593 --> 33:48.061
<i>I have my head on straight.</i>

33:48.128 --> 33:50.397
It's time to become
the athlete that I am.

33:50.464 --> 33:51.999
Winning is going
to be happening.

33:52.065 --> 33:53.734
I'm the best.
I'm a corn star.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.759

34:33.640 --> 34:35.409
I want some 85% cacao.

34:35.475 --> 34:37.611

and shove it up your ass?

34:37.678 --> 34:39.279
[laughter]

34:39.346 --> 34:40.480
That was good.

34:40.547 --> 34:41.882
- Yeah, this food
was really good.

34:51.725 --> 34:54.628
- I went on Twitter,
and I followed

34:54.695 --> 34:56.563
the ACL
official Twitter account,

34:56.630 --> 34:59.066
and I followed
every person that's playing.

34:59.132 --> 35:01.568
I'm gonna follow this person.
I'm gonna follow that person.

35:01.635 --> 35:03.604
I'm gonna follow that person.

35:03.670 --> 35:06.073
Oh, my God, this guy's
blowing my [bleep] up.

35:06.139 --> 35:07.407
- Followed all of them?

35:08.342 --> 35:10.210
Girl, that's, like, a lot.

35:10.277 --> 35:11.879
Like, what are you doing?
Why?

35:11.945 --> 35:15.215
Who's Jeremy Schermerhorn?
- [laughs]

35:15.282 --> 35:17.751
- And I'm kind of worried
because I think

35:17.818 --> 35:19.686
Mike is gonna be pissed.

35:19.753 --> 35:21.922
Professional cornhole player.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.458
Wait, is he playing against
[bleep] professionals?

35:24.525 --> 35:25.993
- It's on ESPN.

35:26.059 --> 35:27.461
My full-on intention
is to help Mike

35:27.528 --> 35:29.029
in every which way I can,
right?

35:29.096 --> 35:32.299
So DMing these guys
and getting in their heads,

35:32.366 --> 35:35.135
strategy-wise
it makes perfect sense

35:35.202 --> 35:37.971
because you always want
to distract your opponent.

35:38.038 --> 35:39.573
I'm, like, really good at this.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.009
So I will be
the distractee--distracter,

35:42.075 --> 35:44.077
and, you know,
that's my strategy.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.245
- What is happening?

35:45.312 --> 35:47.247
I did not message anyone.
- Listen.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.916
- I do not condone this.
- Listen.

35:48.982 --> 35:51.518
If anything, I found out stuff.

35:51.585 --> 35:54.254
- Oh, my God.
What is this?

35:54.321 --> 35:56.123
- Listen, boys.
It was a great day.

35:56.190 --> 35:57.724
I think the only
thing left is--

35:57.791 --> 35:59.092
is to get some beauty rest.

35:59.159 --> 36:01.595
- Yes, sir, rest up.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:01.662 --> 36:03.096
- Beauty sleep
for the big tournament.

36:03.163 --> 36:04.431
- Yeah.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.534
- Is that all you messaged?
- I don't know.

36:07.601 --> 36:10.070
- I'm scared to look
at any more private messages.

36:10.137 --> 36:11.805
[burps]

36:11.872 --> 36:14.508
I love Ang.
Her heart is there.

36:14.575 --> 36:16.610
But, like,
messaging the whole league?

36:16.677 --> 36:18.679
- Should we tell Mike?
- Yes.

36:18.745 --> 36:19.847
<i>♪♪ ♪♪</i>

36:19.913 --> 36:20.948

I don't care."

36:22.416 --> 36:24.451
- Well, as long as we told him.
- All right.

36:24.518 --> 36:26.420

<i>- Now, I know</i>
<i>I didn't have any wine.</i>

36:44.705 --> 36:46.473
Mike didn't have no wine.
Vinny didn't have no wine.

This only means one thing.

36:47.741 --> 36:50.344

36:51.678 --> 36:52.913

your house, Mike, sorry.

36:52.980 --> 36:54.181
- Thought you guys
were coming tomorrow.

36:54.248 --> 36:55.616
- Where were you guys?

36:55.682 --> 36:56.950
We've been waiting for
literally, like, four hours.

36:57.017 --> 36:58.085

36:58.151 --> 36:59.119

36:59.186 --> 37:00.354
- It's gorgeous.
- Right?

37:00.420 --> 37:02.823
- Are you rich?
- No, I'm an athlete.

37:04.157 --> 37:07.027
These guys have all
won prior tournaments,

37:07.094 --> 37:08.762
so I got to bring my A game.

37:08.829 --> 37:10.464
- Did you ever play
against Jay Cutler?

37:11.632 --> 37:13.066
- No.
No, I never met him.

37:13.133 --> 37:14.501
<i>- [bleep] it.</i>

37:14.568 --> 37:15.869
I'm gonna tell Mike
right now.

- What?

37:20.274 --> 37:21.575
What?

37:21.642 --> 37:23.877
Nicole really has
freaked me out a little bit.

37:23.944 --> 37:24.878
Like, oh,
he's gonna get mad.

37:24.945 --> 37:26.547
He was a quarterback, right?

37:26.613 --> 37:28.048
- Was a quarterback, yes.

37:28.115 --> 37:29.850
<i>- But all in all,</i>
<i>if I know Mike</i>

37:29.917 --> 37:31.285
the way I know Mike,
he'll be like,

37:31.351 --> 37:33.420
"Thank you for, like,
thinking about me."

37:33.487 --> 37:34.555
- He is in the tournament.

37:34.621 --> 37:36.690
I don't face him first.

37:36.757 --> 37:38.525
But--

37:38.592 --> 37:40.127
- He's gonna actually think
to himself,

37:40.194 --> 37:43.263
like, "How the [bleep]
did I not think of this?"

37:43.330 --> 37:44.565
- Something weird's
going on over here.

37:44.631 --> 37:45.899
- Yeah, why?
What's happening?

37:45.966 --> 37:47.034
- I don't know.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.368
- You want me to do it?

37:48.435 --> 37:50.804
- You can tell
they have something to tell me.

37:50.871 --> 37:53.140
I'm worried.
- It's not bad.

37:54.575 --> 37:55.876
- Oh, my God.

37:55.943 --> 37:57.077
- What happened?

38:07.821 --> 38:09.289
- Something weird's
going on over here.

38:09.356 --> 38:10.757
- Stop.

38:10.824 --> 38:12.993
[bleep], man.

38:13.060 --> 38:15.495
- Angelina looks a little bit
uneasy right now.

38:15.562 --> 38:17.064
I mean,
Angelina's always a hot mess

38:17.130 --> 38:18.799
and, like,
is always keeping secrets,

38:18.866 --> 38:20.400
but, like, something is off.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.102
- It's not bad.
- What happened?

38:22.169 --> 38:23.670
- All right, so she
might have DMed Jay Cutler.

38:23.737 --> 38:24.972
- Might have?
I did do it.

38:25.038 --> 38:25.973
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

38:26.039 --> 38:27.541
- What'd you say?
- Come on.

38:27.608 --> 38:29.009
- Just like, "Hey, are you
going to be at the tournament?"

38:29.076 --> 38:31.545
- Yeah,
it's a strategy for you.

38:31.612 --> 38:33.380
Good intentions, no malicious.

38:33.447 --> 38:35.182
Like, just trying to help you.

38:35.249 --> 38:37.050
- Tell me what you said
in this DM

38:37.117 --> 38:38.452
and what he said to you.

38:38.519 --> 38:39.820
- She just said, "Hey,
I think you might be going

38:39.887 --> 38:40.821
against Mike the Situation."

38:40.888 --> 38:41.822
"Sorry, Mike.

38:41.889 --> 38:42.890
Quick exit for him."

38:42.956 --> 38:44.391
- What the hell?
- Ooh.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.293
- He already
started talking [bleep].

38:46.360 --> 38:48.095
So Angelina said, "Ha ha ha."

38:48.161 --> 38:50.898
She goes, "I think Mike's
been practicing, actually."

38:50.964 --> 38:52.599
"It doesn't matter.
I'm better than him."

38:52.666 --> 38:53.800
- Wow.

38:53.867 --> 38:54.768
I don't appreciate

38:54.835 --> 38:56.904
Angeliner's DMing Jay Cutler.

38:56.970 --> 38:59.373
- But don't you think it's
better that you know before--

38:59.439 --> 39:01.375
- You're spinning him up.
- No.

39:01.441 --> 39:03.143
This is throwing me
off my game a little bit,

39:03.210 --> 39:06.213
knowing that one of the other
competitors is talking trash.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.549
This is technically
sort of a distraction

39:08.615 --> 39:09.950
that I kind of didn't need.

39:10.017 --> 39:13.921
Now I know this person
is talking [bleep] to you.

39:13.987 --> 39:15.455
It gets
in your head a little bit.

39:15.522 --> 39:18.058
- I'm helping him here.
How does he not see this?

39:18.125 --> 39:19.259
They love you.

39:19.326 --> 39:21.028
This guy loves you
because of me.

39:21.094 --> 39:22.462
- And which guy is that?
- What the [bleep]?

39:22.529 --> 39:24.431
- Wait, so there's more
than Jay Cutler?

39:24.498 --> 39:25.666
- Just say what you did.

39:25.732 --> 39:27.434
- So I went
on the ACL Twitter,

39:27.501 --> 39:29.002
<i>and I saw</i>
<i>who they were following,</i>

39:29.069 --> 39:30.704
and I literally,
like, started following

39:30.771 --> 39:32.272
whoever they were following,

39:32.339 --> 39:34.875
and then all the guys
started following me back.

39:34.942 --> 39:36.810
- She went
to American Cornball League

39:36.877 --> 39:40.714
and hit everybody up.
- Angelina, what are you doing?

39:40.781 --> 39:42.349
- Wait.
Let's see the DMs.

39:42.416 --> 39:44.551
"Hey, you coming to NC Friday?"

39:44.618 --> 39:46.520
"I'm here now.
What's up?"

39:46.587 --> 39:49.189
- [screams]
Oh, my God.

39:49.256 --> 39:52.392
- "We just won the USA Cornhole
men's doubles national title."

39:52.459 --> 39:53.694

39:53.760 --> 39:55.429
"I could even
introduce you to everyone."

39:55.495 --> 39:57.664
She said, "See you Friday,"
with a smiley face.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.399
- How long's this competition?
- He's flirting.

39:59.466 --> 40:01.301
He goes, "You any good?
LOL."

40:01.368 --> 40:02.402
[laughter]

40:02.469 --> 40:04.238
- Stop, I'm gonna pee.
- [laughs]

40:04.304 --> 40:06.974
- Who's going to score more
during this tournament?

40:07.040 --> 40:08.475
Mike or Angelina?

40:08.542 --> 40:10.377
"If you want to meet up after,
just let me know.

40:10.444 --> 40:12.679
Could give you my number,
or just message me here."

40:12.746 --> 40:14.515

We have, like,
25 or so team members."

40:20.187 --> 40:22.289
[laughter]

40:22.356 --> 40:23.657
- I'm here for the gangbang.

40:23.724 --> 40:25.826
- "So if it's too overwhelming,
I understand."

40:25.893 --> 40:27.261
- Stop!

40:27.327 --> 40:28.595
- "But everyone
would be really excited."

40:28.662 --> 40:30.163
[laughter]

40:30.230 --> 40:31.832
- This is
the definition of messy.

40:31.899 --> 40:33.400
- Of gangbang.

40:33.467 --> 40:36.637
- The way that Angelina's
doing things is messy as usual,

40:36.703 --> 40:40.674
and it's very on brand,
and I don't appreciate it.

40:40.741 --> 40:42.309
Can't you just
be invited to event

40:42.376 --> 40:43.844
and support it instead of--

40:43.911 --> 40:45.779
- Getting gangbanged?
- Shut the [bleep] up.

40:45.846 --> 40:47.281
<i>- This is</i>
<i>the opposite of support.</i>

40:47.347 --> 40:48.849
I'm out of my zone right now.

40:48.916 --> 40:50.384
Talking trash
with the enemy,

40:50.450 --> 40:51.652
it's a distraction.

40:51.718 --> 40:53.287
- It's a distraction
for them, actually.

40:53.353 --> 40:54.555
That's why I did it.

40:54.621 --> 40:56.290
- You're DMing the whole ACL.

40:56.356 --> 40:57.658
This is messy, Ang.
- How is it messy?

40:57.724 --> 40:59.660
- Come on.
- Because now when he's--

40:59.726 --> 41:01.395
when he's standing
across from that board

41:01.461 --> 41:02.596
and he's doing his thing,

41:02.663 --> 41:03.730
he's going to be thinking
about all of them

41:03.797 --> 41:05.666
running the train on you.

41:05.732 --> 41:07.467
- Probably.

41:15.275 --> 41:16.476
<i>- Angelina is a loose cannon,</i>

41:16.543 --> 41:17.878
<i>and it's throwing me</i>
<i>off my game.</i>

41:17.945 --> 41:19.246
- I was trying to help you.
- Help me?

41:19.313 --> 41:21.648
You're the definition of toxic.
- Oh, my God.

41:21.715 --> 41:22.649
- Vin, when are you
gonna get laid?

41:22.716 --> 41:23.917
- You tell me.

41:23.984 --> 41:25.185
<i>This girl does</i>
<i>not stop thinking</i>

41:25.252 --> 41:26.653
<i>about sex</i>
<i>now that she's single.</i>

41:26.720 --> 41:27.688
- There's a smoosh room here.
- You want to do that?

41:27.754 --> 41:28.989
I'll do it.
- Oh!

41:29.056 --> 41:30.290
<i>- Do you like him?</i>

41:30.357 --> 41:31.859
- I would date
Vinny full-blown.

41:31.925 --> 41:33.727
- Now that's
how you get pinkeye.
