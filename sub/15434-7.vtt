00:00.350 --> 00:01.870
Previously on "Brothers and Sisters"...</font>

00:01.950 --> 00:05.030
This is the first date I've had in 40 years.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.830
I hope there--there isn't a misunderstanding.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.740
We've had lunch together over a hundred times.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.440
And I didn't think this was any different.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.390
What are you doing here?

00:12.420 --> 00:13.980
Oh, hello, Kitty.

00:14.020 --> 00:18.240
I ended an engagement only to find 
out that you're dating Malibu Barbie.

00:18.270 --> 00:22.490
Dad sold a million dollars worth 
of stock back to the company.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.920
Ojai paid $15 million for it.

00:24.970 --> 00:27.090
$15 million we can't find.

00:27.119 --> 00:30.660
The trail stops at a password 
between five and eight characters long.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.189
- Is that your daughter?
- Yeah.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.940
- Her name's Becky. 
- Becky.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.100
You're sterile.

00:35.150 --> 00:38.030
Having children with you would make me the happiest woman in the world.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.960
But I don't care how we have them.

00:39.970 --> 00:42.100
You can't dispute global warming, Kitty. It's a fact.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.890
Oh, you wanna talk about the facts?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.590
Okay, well, here's an inconvenient truth:

00:45.650 --> 00:49.060
-- in Africa, 3,000 children die every day from Malaria.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.910
What can save them? D.D.T.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.400
The environmentalists, though, they don't wanna lift the ban on D.D.T.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.870
because it might thin the shells of some bird's eggs.

00:55.900 --> 00:59.490
Okay, excuse me while I go and projectile vomit on Al Gore.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.740
Looks like that will be the last word for tonight.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.170
Until next time, from all of us here at "Red, White & Blue,"

01:05.190 --> 01:07.410
good night and stay safe.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.020
And we're out.

01:09.060 --> 01:10.260
"Stay safe"?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.370
Yeah, I'm trying a new sign-off.

01:11.370 --> 01:12.790
I asked for suggestions on my blog.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.970
You know, our average viewer is a 50-year-old white guy who makes $100,000 a year?

01:16.970 --> 01:19.440
What does he need to stay safe from? U.V.B rays?

01:19.490 --> 01:20.580
Great show, guys!

01:20.630 --> 01:22.790
Kitty, here's the research for your interview with the French ambassador.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.310
Do you know the French didn't invent the french fries?

01:25.350 --> 01:27.370
Les pommes frites originated in Belgium.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.800
We don't call 'em Belgian fries.

01:28.850 --> 01:29.860
Weird, huh?

01:29.870 --> 01:34.020
Yeah, yeah, but you did know that this is a political show and not a cooking show?

01:34.050 --> 01:37.950
And just to be safe, I included the most recent G.N.P. data from the European Union.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.690
You know, in case you wanna ask him about non-stationary trends in the French economy

01:40.720 --> 01:42.710
and how that's affecting the young Muslim workforce.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.660
Amber, you truly are a study in contradictions.

01:47.530 --> 01:51.490
Oh, so I got you, me and a bunch of my friends on the list at the Irony Club.

01:51.490 --> 01:53.270
Thursday is body glitter night.

01:53.310 --> 01:54.810
It's gonna be a total scene.

01:54.850 --> 01:56.480
- Sounds great. 
- I promise you'll love it.

01:56.530 --> 01:59.100
This is gonna be even better than J.T.

02:00.130 --> 02:01.570
Bye.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.510
You know, I, um...

02:04.570 --> 02:08.820
I think that they have some glitter in one of the storage spaces leftover from Christmas.

02:08.870 --> 02:10.039
Please don't start.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.590
I can't defend myself.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.400
She is so enthusiastic about everything.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.600
It's exhausting.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.840
She's adorable and she's utterly refreshing.

02:17.870 --> 02:18.900
Who's J.T.?

02:18.920 --> 02:20.900
Justin Timberlake.

02:21.230 --> 02:22.530
Kitty?

02:22.630 --> 02:26.690
Let's go someplace together...this weekend.

02:27.070 --> 02:28.570
I don't care where.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.390
Someplace where there's no blue chair, no red chair-- ,just, um, just us.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.950
So we can see if...

02:34.980 --> 02:39.080
if this-- what we-- what we thought we had-- could work.

02:39.100 --> 02:42.770
You know, you have the worst timing of anybody I have ever met in my life.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.230
Stop grinning at me like that.

02:48.190 --> 02:52.800
The sale only includes the orchards, the out-buildings and the operational equipment.

02:52.830 --> 02:55.140
We want the ranch house and the acreage as well.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.060
All in. Our offer's 9.3.

02:58.370 --> 03:01.070
Give us the weekend to think it through.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.830
It's a fair offer.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.400
We'll see.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.440
I didn't know you put the ranch house in play, too.

03:13.470 --> 03:14.630
I didn't.

03:14.700 --> 03:18.230
But when one's father embezzles $15 million of his own company's pension money,

03:18.260 --> 03:20.070
one can't really afford to be sentimental.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.610
Okay, even if we include the sale of the ranch house, it still leaves us $3 million short.

03:24.660 --> 03:29.360
All I'm saying is, let's not jump the gun right when we managed to find out where Dad put the money.

03:29.390 --> 03:34.190
Finding password protected accounts is not the same thing as finding the money, Tommy.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.810
Particularly when we can't crack the password.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.310
God, Sarah, what were you thinking?

03:39.380 --> 03:41.470
I was thinking it might be fun to keep us out of bankruptcy.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.000
Yeah, but the ranch?

03:43.020 --> 03:44.220
Why not sell our childhoods?

03:44.250 --> 03:45.840
Because they're not worth $9 million.

03:45.890 --> 03:50.380
Well, they were before you have to net out expenses on things like therapy.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.070
Oh, why are you glaring at me?

03:52.110 --> 03:53.950
She said something, too.

03:54.650 --> 03:55.920
You're quiet.

03:55.980 --> 03:56.980
She's the prez.

03:56.980 --> 03:57.980
Yeah, of the company.

03:57.990 --> 03:59.980
Look, the ranch house is part of the family.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.780
My first memory is of Dad reading me a bedtime story up there.

04:02.780 --> 04:05.720
I learned to ride a bike up there, among other things.

04:05.790 --> 04:09.060
Remember how the air used to smell at night?

04:09.090 --> 04:11.470
Yeah, in the fall-- the mesquite and the charcoal.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.920
Oh, come on, guys. We're not the Waltons.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.620
Nobody even used the ranch house last year.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.680
I think we should trust Sarah's judgment.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.000
If she's determined that we should sell the ranch, then we should sell the ranch.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.960
- Thank you, Mom. 
- Oh, someone call an exorcist.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.340
- Mom's possessed.
- Yeah.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.360
We could all go up there this weekend,

04:29.380 --> 04:32.360
box up all the stuff we wanna keep, make it a family outing.

04:32.410 --> 04:35.200
We could play running charades they way we used to.

04:35.240 --> 04:38.820
The boys could sleep in the bunks and try to scare the girls at night.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.140
I would love to, Mom,

04:41.180 --> 04:44.360
but I have to stay back and crunch the numbers on the deal.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.310
- Yeah, I have to help her. 
- Yeah, me, too.

04:46.330 --> 04:47.490
No, I've got a lot of...

04:47.530 --> 04:48.790
I'm-- I'm crunching.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.410
Anybody want more wine?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.930
What I remember about Ojai were the boys

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
and the sunsets and this old chair on the porch where I read "Jane Eyre."

05:01.880 --> 05:05.090
Oh, and I lost my virginity there, too.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.370
You never told me that.

05:10.660 --> 05:15.200
Tucker Booth-- tall, blue-eyed, blond hair,

05:15.250 --> 05:18.000
a very hot day in the tree house.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.960
Okay, don't need to hear more of that.

05:23.910 --> 05:26.300
You know what we should do this weekend?

05:26.870 --> 05:29.390
No, no, we can't go to Ojai.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.780
Come on, let's go.

05:30.820 --> 05:32.570
No one will be there.

05:32.910 --> 05:38.600
I'd like to, uh, check out the tree house, put my stamp on it.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.260
You think you can last longer than he did?

05:41.310 --> 05:45.310
I lost my virginity in Ojai-- both times.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.630
First to this girl called Sarah Gimble.

05:48.660 --> 05:53.040
And second, one summer later, to this-- this guy-- this total stud.

05:53.080 --> 05:55.010
Everyone in Ojai was in love with him.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.500
What was his name?

05:56.580 --> 05:58.470
Tucker Booth.

05:58.500 --> 06:02.190
Really tall, with this bleached blond hair.

06:02.250 --> 06:05.600
I lured him into this tree house Tommy and I had built.

06:05.650 --> 06:06.950
Hey, you know what we should do?

06:06.980 --> 06:08.230
Google "Tucker Booth"?

06:08.260 --> 06:10.440
No, we should go up there this weekend.

06:10.470 --> 06:13.170
I mean, the thought of not seeing the place again is breaking my heart.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.210
I thought you had a lot of work to do.

06:14.210 --> 06:15.520
Yeah, I do. I can do it up there.

06:15.550 --> 06:16.950
And I want to see the orchards.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.970
I wanna see the tree house.

06:19.950 --> 06:21.690
Why would I wanna go to Ojai with you?

06:21.720 --> 06:23.850
Because it's so cool up there. You have no idea.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.180
We would have the whole place to ourselves.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.960
Look, the house has this huge fireplace.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.220
At night it gets so dark you can actually see the stars.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.590
And there's this tree house-- this really fantastic tree house --

06:34.620 --> 06:37.200
where I got high for the first time with this really cool dude,Tucker Booth.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.190
Come on. I'm freaking out just thinking about this.

06:39.220 --> 06:40.890
Come.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.920
I'm not going away with you, Justin.

06:44.940 --> 06:49.700
We just started dating, and I'm a good Catholic girl.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.990
Okay, you know, I've been with enough Catholic girls to know

06:52.020 --> 06:55.310
the expression "good Catholic girl"-- it's an oxymoron.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.480
Since when do you know what oxymoron means?

06:57.520 --> 06:58.940
You know, I'm full of surprises.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.160
And maybe if you come to Ojai, I can show--

07:04.070 --> 07:05.380
-- I'll take that as a yes.

07:05.430 --> 07:06.720
We're gonna have so much fun!

07:06.780 --> 07:10.430
The network's been beating me up about our 18 to 35 demographic numbers.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.090
So I need each of you to turn in five story ideas that appeal to the youth market.

07:14.140 --> 07:18.340
Kitty, your interview with Jean Claude "frenchy-french" is this weekend.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.460
I'm thinking we should get out of the studio.

07:20.490 --> 07:23.540
Uh, uh, yeah, Whit, about that interview...

07:25.650 --> 07:28.370
I, uh, I'm really sorry, but I can't do it.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.050
A conflict-- something just came up.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.180
All right, Warren, you take it.

07:33.210 --> 07:35.990
Oh, I can't. I got Vegas this weekend with some college buddies.

07:36.050 --> 07:37.460
Jack, you're up.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.220
Oh, sorry, I can't.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.530
I'm taking my mom to the circus.

07:40.550 --> 07:42.250
Oh, come on.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.580
What? She's been looking forward to it for months.

07:44.770 --> 07:46.600
I could do it.

07:46.650 --> 07:47.940
It's okay, Amber.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.280
No, no, wait a minute.

07:49.310 --> 07:50.640
Whit, that is a great idea.

07:50.690 --> 07:52.300
I mean, you should give her a chance.

07:52.330 --> 07:54.220
She's got a degree in journalism.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.750
She compiled all the research.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.100
She knows everything I know.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.740
You said that you wanted to appeal to the youth market.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.710
What could be more youthful and appealing than Amber?

08:06.640 --> 08:10.120
Okay, but I want you to rehearse with her before you go.

08:10.150 --> 08:13.700
And if she screws up, I'm gonna run seven minutes of your blooper reel.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.490
That's it, everybody.

08:17.090 --> 08:20.080
Kitty, I am so grateful for your confidence in me.

08:20.120 --> 08:21.200
I won't let you down.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.210
I promise.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.500
No, you know, I know you're gonna be great.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.030
Knock 'em dead.

08:26.790 --> 08:29.750
You are the best mentor I've ever had.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.419
Oh, right.

08:32.980 --> 08:34.460
I better go study.

08:38.860 --> 08:39.990
So, it's a weekend?

08:40.030 --> 08:43.919
On two conditions-- one, you tell Amber exactly what is going on.

08:43.950 --> 08:45.790
And two, if this doesn't work out with us,

08:45.830 --> 08:50.000
you will stop, once and for all, with your midday afternoon love confessions.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.110
So it's a "yes?"

08:52.160 --> 08:53.820
It's a "yes."

08:54.690 --> 08:56.410
Well, great, great.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.150
Where do you wanna go? San Diego? Laguna?

08:58.200 --> 09:01.180
You know, actually, I have a...

09:01.230 --> 09:03.470
a great place.

09:03.930 --> 09:06.640
<font color=#38B0DE>Subtitled by J&J Subtitles</font>

09:06.650 --> 09:10.930
<font color=#38B0DE>jeralvsut@hotmail.com</font>

09:11.200 --> 09:12.600
David, excuse me.

09:12.650 --> 09:15.830
I don't want to interrupt, but could I ask you a favor?

09:15.870 --> 09:17.970
Only if apple-tinis are involved again.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.830
Funny. Really funny.

09:19.850 --> 09:23.390
No, it doesn't.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.730
Um, could I borrow your truck?

09:25.770 --> 09:27.900
I've decided to go to Ojai today.

09:27.930 --> 09:29.460
We're selling the big ranch house.

09:29.510 --> 09:31.670
William's gone. It feels like an extravagance.

09:31.690 --> 09:33.630
And there's so much I want to keep, like this big,

09:33.680 --> 09:37.720
oak panel where we marked all the kids' heights when they were growing up.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.190
Well, I tell you what, why don't you let me drive you?

09:40.210 --> 09:41.740
You shouldn't be tearing down paneling by yourself.

09:41.740 --> 09:42.740
No, no, no.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.730
I would not ask you to drop whatever it is you're doing today, no.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.880
I'm already three weeks behind on four different jobs.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.260
One more day is not gonna make a difference.

09:49.310 --> 09:52.510
Clearly, that's why contractors never finish anything on time.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.770
That is why.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.460
Let me drive you.

09:56.430 --> 09:57.940
All right.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.460
It's just an errand--

09:59.490 --> 10:01.780
one friend doing another friend a favor

10:01.820 --> 10:04.080
-- platonic, totally and utterly platonic.

10:04.110 --> 10:06.120
I'll buy everything. I'll pay for gas. I'll buy us some--

10:06.170 --> 10:07.620
Nora, I want to drive you.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.780
Please let me drive you.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.820
Fine.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.010
Thank you.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.390
You're welcome.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.770
Lot 7-2-4 has had 3 confirmed pregnancies.

10:18.820 --> 10:20.960
He's a fertility clinic's dream

10:21.010 --> 10:24.510
-- straight brown hair, college graduate.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.480
Amazing he has any sperm left to donate.

10:29.290 --> 10:32.150
We're not really supposed to have favorites,

10:32.180 --> 10:35.470
but this one is very popular.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.860
He's got a great sense of humor,

10:37.880 --> 10:42.460
and he's of Irish and Jewish descent, just like you, Mr.Walker.

10:42.510 --> 10:46.430
Plus he's an Ivy League grad, Phi Beta Kappa.

10:47.340 --> 10:49.770
You know what? C-could you excuse us for a minute?

10:49.810 --> 10:50.820
No problem.

10:50.830 --> 10:51.890
You guys take as long as you need.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.310
I'll be right down the hall.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.990
Thank you.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.220
Are you all right?

11:02.700 --> 11:05.660
I know the idea is to find a donor like me,

11:05.690 --> 11:08.370
you know, same color hair and eyes.

11:08.390 --> 11:11.340
But when I think about that guy's sperm in your body,

11:11.380 --> 11:14.040
I-I just want to strangle him.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.050
Let's go home.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.390
I'm sorry. Look, you know what?

11:24.420 --> 11:26.240
We should go out of town.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.840
All this stuff, it's just-- it's freaking us out.

11:29.890 --> 11:35.520
We'll go up to the ranch, you and me, and just relax.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.700
Okay.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.430
I still can't get into the account.

11:42.460 --> 11:45.040
I've tried everything-- uh, high school mascot,

11:45.090 --> 11:47.780
a-a word or phrase from a postcard that he kept...

11:47.810 --> 11:49.550
Sounds mind-numbing.

11:49.590 --> 11:52.510
I've been over everything you gave me to try and figure out the password.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.900
What's this?

11:53.950 --> 11:56.710
Jordan asked me for a list of your father's friends and acquaintances.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.160
You've tried every one of these?

11:58.200 --> 11:59.740
Every name, every name in reverse,

11:59.790 --> 12:03.330
with birthdays, without birthdays, with birthdays in reverse...

12:04.590 --> 12:06.100
I'll keep on it.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.190
Thanks, Jordan.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.690
Call me if any new ideas occur.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.470
Thank you.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.390
What about Holly Harper?

12:16.400 --> 12:18.180
Did you write her name down?

12:18.230 --> 12:20.570
Of course, Sarah. This isn't a time for discretion.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.370
Have you talked to her, Saul?

12:22.420 --> 12:24.850
Maybe she knows a name we don't.

12:26.820 --> 12:31.120
Well, actually, I've been trying to think of a way to bring it up.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.440
It's tricky.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.300
Yeah, well, Joe and I are sneaking up to the ranch house this weekend.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.410
I'll look around up there, and maybe I'll find something useful.

12:42.460 --> 12:44.510
Okay.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.530
Who's Rebecca?

12:50.710 --> 12:52.930
You wrote down "Rebecca."

12:55.830 --> 12:59.190
She was your father's first high school crush, I think.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.850
You think, or you know?

13:00.900 --> 13:02.510
Well, as far as I can recall,

13:02.580 --> 13:08.530
he referred to her with great affection when he learned that she died a few years ago.

13:10.200 --> 13:14.170
Unfortunately, I don't remember her birthday.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.530
Have a good time at the ranch.

13:15.560 --> 13:16.960
Oh, we will.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.410
I love that place.

13:18.410 --> 13:19.410
It's a little slice of heaven.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.040
I know.

13:23.000 --> 13:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:42.800 --> 13:44.770
Oh, my-- I'm drenched.

13:46.940 --> 13:49.650
Oh, God, Nora, this place is beautiful.

13:50.140 --> 13:52.890
A lot of good times here...

13:52.940 --> 13:56.100
a lot of ghosts, too. Good ones, though.

13:56.590 --> 13:58.280
Here.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.410
Here it is.

14:00.510 --> 14:04.160
Oh, my panel.

14:10.330 --> 14:13.140
I could see why you want to save this.

14:13.790 --> 14:16.400
It was a yearly ritual every summer.

14:16.530 --> 14:19.440
Justin would always cheat and stand on his tiptoes.

14:19.470 --> 14:22.470
He was always an inch shorter than whatever it said up there.

14:27.890 --> 14:30.060
You're dripping wet.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.830
Well, so are you, if you hadn't noticed.

14:32.870 --> 14:36.110
Yeah, I am.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.990
We could throw our clothes in the dryer.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.280
Well, I don't mean to be picky, but, uh,

14:42.320 --> 14:44.100
what are we gonna wear in the meantime?

14:44.190 --> 14:48.440
Uh, well, tell you what, you could go into the bedroom,

14:48.470 --> 14:50.370
take your clothes off. I'll put 'em in the dryer.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.190
You just wait in there.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.400
How long do you think it's gonna take?

14:58.460 --> 14:59.670
Well, kind of impatient, aren't you?

14:59.720 --> 15:01.320
I barely got my shirt off.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.540
No.

15:02.570 --> 15:03.910
To remove the panel.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.660
Oh, I don't know.

15:05.710 --> 15:07.170
Shouldn't take long.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.810
You shouldn't worry about it anyway.

15:10.090 --> 15:13.350
I don't think we should be on the road right now.

15:15.620 --> 15:20.710
Uh, you know, I've got some canned goods in the storm cellar...

15:20.740 --> 15:23.090
maybe even a bottle of wine.

15:23.610 --> 15:26.660
We could make a picnic out of it.

15:26.820 --> 15:31.730
You can't believe what great things I can do with a can of soup.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.950
I'd expect nothing less.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.720
Oh, this sucks about the weather.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.880
It's gonna ruin our walks to the orange groves.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.050
That's okay.

15:45.080 --> 15:47.790
I was planning on strictly indoor activities anyway.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.260
Oh, well, listen up, city boy,

15:50.290 --> 15:53.740
I am going to teach you the joys of the--

15:53.900 --> 15:54.930
Mom.

15:54.930 --> 15:55.930
Kitty.

15:55.930 --> 15:56.930
Mom!

15:56.930 --> 15:57.940
-Kitty! 
-What are you doing here?

15:57.970 --> 15:59.530
What are you doing here?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.540
You told me that you weren't coming till the middle of the week.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.880
You said you weren't coming at all.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.340
- Well-- 
- Oh, look, Nora, I found a robe.

16:13.010 --> 16:15.440
Well, uh, looks like you guys had the same idea we did.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.920
I'm Warren, by the way.

16:16.970 --> 16:18.580
I'm David, Nora's contractor.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.370
Of course you are.

16:21.530 --> 16:23.030
Look, don't you have a robe or something in here?

16:23.080 --> 16:25.390
Mother. Mother. Mother!

16:25.430 --> 16:26.430
What?

16:26.430 --> 16:27.430
I'm sorry, but when I packed,

16:27.430 --> 16:30.790
I didn't realize I was going to be walking into Caligula's bathhouse.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.790
Well, what did you pack for?

16:31.790 --> 16:33.760
I packed for worK.

16:34.970 --> 16:36.740
Warren and I are...

16:36.810 --> 16:39.870
you know, we're-- we're preparing for a very big interview.

16:39.930 --> 16:42.000
Is that the euphemism of choice these days?

16:42.050 --> 16:43.050
You know what, Mother?

16:43.050 --> 16:44.060
You're just trying to divert the attention

16:44.110 --> 16:46.910
because Dave came up here to remodel you.

16:46.960 --> 16:50.590
I di-- I-- Oh, my god.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.140
- Who is it? 
- It's Kevin and Scotty.

16:52.180 --> 16:55.190
That big mouth. We'll never hear the end of this. You've got to do something.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.230
Well, w-what do you want me to do, Mother?

16:56.230 --> 16:57.230
You're the journalist. Lie!

16:57.230 --> 16:58.990
What? No. I don't have anything to hide.

16:59.030 --> 17:00.460
I came up here to work.

17:00.530 --> 17:03.490
With a bag full of silky things and no laptop and no papers and no pencils?

17:03.530 --> 17:06.210
Just-- just, Mom-- Mom.

17:08.550 --> 17:09.550
Hi.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.349
Hey, guys.

17:12.230 --> 17:14.240
Good. I thought you were coming next week.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.369
I changed my mind.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.220
- Woman's prerogative. 
- It certainly is.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.030
Is that Dave's truck out there?

17:19.069 --> 17:20.670
- Yeah.
- Well, of course it is.

17:20.710 --> 17:24.339
He came-- he came to make-- we're packing some boxes, and--

17:24.359 --> 17:25.480
Are you cold, Mom?

17:25.530 --> 17:26.560
- Sure, it's freezing.
- No.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.890
-Well, kind of cold. 
- Now that the blanket's on, she's okay.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.900
Whose hybrid is that?

17:30.940 --> 17:32.670
Well, that's Warren's...

17:32.760 --> 17:35.280
because, well-- well, see, what happened is--

17:35.300 --> 17:37.400
is that we're preparing this really big interview. --It's big.

17:37.430 --> 17:40.470
And then Warren decided to come up to bring me some very big papers...

17:40.520 --> 17:42.560
- and stuff...
- it's so great of him.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.480
That's really nice of him. Did he bring Amber?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.390
You know...

17:51.810 --> 17:54.330
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.880
I don't-- I don't-- I don't believe it.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.160
Who's that?

17:57.200 --> 17:59.010
It's the rest of the family, honey.

17:59.050 --> 18:00.130
Holy crap.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.160
No kidding.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.410
Run this by me one more time.

18:02.490 --> 18:04.860
Oh, is it really all that complicated, Tommy?

18:04.940 --> 18:07.180
I mean, Mom wanted to say good-bye to the place.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.220
I wanted to help, and...

18:09.270 --> 18:12.490
Dave offered to donate his truck, while Warren came up to...

18:12.520 --> 18:14.190
deliver tape on Israel, uh,

18:14.250 --> 18:16.700
for a piece that we're doing on the show this week.

18:16.740 --> 18:19.130
Where does Amber fit into this?

18:19.210 --> 18:20.850
Amber is working.

18:20.850 --> 18:21.850
You know, we still haven't heard

18:21.850 --> 18:24.050
why you two married couples changed your minds.

18:24.090 --> 18:26.710
- We just wanted to be alone. 
- Just wanted time alone.

18:26.790 --> 18:30.280
So then, there you have it, and the roads are like rivers,

18:30.340 --> 18:31.780
so I'm afraid we're here for the duration.

18:31.850 --> 18:34.600
But luckily, we have just enough beds.

18:37.820 --> 18:38.910
Oh, no.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.960
There were enough beds.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.970
You guys are so lame.

18:50.270 --> 18:52.080
Good morning, everyone.

18:52.140 --> 18:53.520
Morning.

18:53.570 --> 18:57.540
Does anyone want to confess to being the one who snores like a freight train?

18:58.050 --> 18:59.650
Kevin, I'm looking at you.

18:59.690 --> 19:00.910
It was Kitty.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.580
I did-- I do not snore.

19:02.620 --> 19:04.070
Yeah, you do. You always did.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.390
You just don't know it.

19:06.420 --> 19:09.620
Warren and Scotty and I slept like babies in the bunk room.

19:10.430 --> 19:11.590
Morning.

19:11.670 --> 19:13.320
Oh, wow, we didn't pack clothes?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.900
Yeah, well, I didn't plan on needing any this weekend, Buzzkill.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.790
Morning.

19:20.730 --> 19:22.460
It's like a frat house in here.

19:22.510 --> 19:24.250
It's like old times, isn't it?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.150
Hey, Kev, you want to start up the old tractor?

19:27.180 --> 19:28.690
Couldn't you run me over with it instead?

19:28.730 --> 19:31.250
Come on. We gotta clear up some brush so we can play football.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.120
Well, I hate clearing brush almost as much as I hate football.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.400
I'll do it.

19:36.470 --> 19:37.910
Come on, Kev. It'll be fun.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.750
Bro, I said I'll do it.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.600
I asked Kevin.

19:53.530 --> 19:56.260
Let me just get my shoes.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.800
You know, you shouldn't be so hard on Justin, Tommy.

19:59.860 --> 20:01.480
He's been really good lately.

20:01.550 --> 20:04.940
I don't know. Whatever you think you might be accomplishing, I don't think you are.

20:04.990 --> 20:07.350
What are we doing here, anyway?

20:08.650 --> 20:10.190
it's the battery.

20:10.260 --> 20:11.530
Yeah, look. It's all rusty.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.720
Can you hand me a screwdriver?

20:13.890 --> 20:15.860
You know what a screwdriver looks like.

20:15.930 --> 20:19.220
It's orange and comes in a glass filled with ice.

20:20.760 --> 20:22.290
That thing.

20:22.340 --> 20:24.180
Don't be a wussy. Come on, you got it.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.940
Come here.

20:28.350 --> 20:30.380
Just like I remember it.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.110
It doesn't seem too sturdy.

20:32.140 --> 20:34.250
It's totally safe. See?

20:34.520 --> 20:36.220
Please don't do that.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.010
God, if these walls could talk.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.740
That's all I'm gonna say.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.060
What's that?

20:43.110 --> 20:45.970
Uh, it's a joint--or a jay, also known as a doobie.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.290
I know what a joint is, dumb-ass. I meant, what are you doing with it?

20:48.290 --> 20:49.620
Oh, it's just for old time's sake. Come on.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.170
Jeez, that's nostalgic.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.210
Let's relive what a loser you were when you were16.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.650
Okay, I was not a loser.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.870
You're always bitching that's what your family thinks about you.

20:56.950 --> 20:58.430
Hey, I don't care what my family thinks.

20:58.510 --> 20:59.970
I think it's all you care about.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.700
I am trying to figure out why I'm not mad at you when you talk to me like that.

21:02.730 --> 21:05.940
Because it's nice when someone tells you the truth.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.010
Really?

21:10.680 --> 21:13.320
You look amazing.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.670
I really appreciate you doing this.

21:21.730 --> 21:23.370
This thing is so precious to me.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.460
Of course it is.

21:24.510 --> 21:26.570
I'll, uh, pack it up in my truck

21:26.640 --> 21:28.920
and drop it off at your house on the way home.

21:30.400 --> 21:31.950
Aren't you gonna stay for dinner?

21:32.020 --> 21:33.340
Wasn't planning on it.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.140
Well, I can't let you drive home on an empty stomach,

21:35.190 --> 21:39.410
and besides that, it's gonna be an absolutely sensational meal.

21:39.460 --> 21:40.940
Well, then I'd love to.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Really?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.670
All you had to do was ask.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.080
Careful.

21:46.140 --> 21:47.620
A little slower on that one.

21:47.680 --> 21:48.770
Don't you have cooking to do?

21:48.800 --> 21:50.020
No, I'd rather watch.

21:50.070 --> 21:51.310
I know you would.

21:51.340 --> 21:55.440
You know, I gotta say, your family seems pretty much to the left of the salad fork.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.950
How'd they go wrong with you?

21:57.010 --> 21:59.900
Oh, by being perfect, I guess--

21:59.980 --> 22:02.400
well, at least appearing that way --

22:02.460 --> 22:04.630
wedded bliss for my parents,

22:04.680 --> 22:08.190
songs around the piano during the holidays, touch football in the summertime--

22:08.230 --> 22:10.700
the paradigmatic American nuclear family.

22:10.750 --> 22:11.760
So I don't know.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.290
I guess when I discovered politics,

22:14.340 --> 22:17.610
I decided I wanted to support the party that stood

22:17.670 --> 22:23.180
for those values-- home, family...

22:23.220 --> 22:25.580
America.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.090
What?

22:28.400 --> 22:33.060
It's just that you are the least cynical Republican I think I've ever met.

22:33.090 --> 22:36.050
Well, that's because you just haven't met enough Republicans.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.320
One's enough.

22:38.400 --> 22:43.040
So was Amber upset when you, uh, told her that you were coming up here with me?

22:43.900 --> 22:45.630
No, not at all.

22:45.710 --> 22:48.140
She was too excited about that interview to care.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.340
That's good.

22:50.350 --> 22:53.890
I think you're looking for a needle in a haystack, hon.

22:53.950 --> 22:55.660
Right.

22:55.870 --> 22:58.430
Wish I could just ask him.

22:58.490 --> 23:02.720
Maybe we should hire a medium instead of a forensic accountant.

23:07.660 --> 23:10.830
Ah, I can't get over how much you looked like Paige when you were a kid.

23:12.540 --> 23:14.290
-Who's this? 
-Kitty?

23:14.350 --> 23:15.600
No.

23:15.650 --> 23:16.750
Wait. I don't know.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.350
It's Tommy, yeah?

23:18.420 --> 23:19.830
This is your dad's car?

23:19.910 --> 23:25.020
Yeah, he got that car in, like, '79, so...

23:25.070 --> 23:27.080
I guess it's Justin.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.950
I was in high school in '79.

23:31.050 --> 23:33.700
I wish I'd known you in high school.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.030
You must've been hot.

23:40.140 --> 23:44.090
I know you really wanted to christen the tree house, but--

23:44.120 --> 23:48.130
attic sex is much better than tree house sex.

24:01.310 --> 24:02.960
Well, look on the bright side.

24:03.030 --> 24:05.030
At least now we don't have to clear the pasture,

24:05.080 --> 24:07.450
or better yet, play touch football.

24:08.320 --> 24:10.240
Oh, what?

24:12.320 --> 24:15.540
I don't know. Just this place...

24:15.580 --> 24:17.610
makes me miss Dad even more.

24:17.730 --> 24:21.140
You know, he wasn't exactly who we thought he was,

24:21.170 --> 24:23.160
but growing up, I wanted to be just like him--

24:23.210 --> 24:26.700
you know, a father just like him.

24:26.890 --> 24:30.190
But recently I found out that's not gonna happen.

24:30.420 --> 24:33.770
Julia and I have been trying to get pregnant.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.440
We can't.

24:37.050 --> 24:39.070
It's my fault.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.140
I'm sterile.

24:41.450 --> 24:42.610
Oh, man.

24:42.670 --> 24:43.780
I am so sorry.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.280
We went to one of those sperm banks.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.730
I'm-- I'm just not into it.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.700
They're like real estate brokers.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.430
Look, I can get you a great adoption lawyer if you want.

24:51.470 --> 24:52.690
No. No.

24:52.730 --> 24:54.920
I don't want to do that. It just-- it doesn't feel right.

24:54.980 --> 24:57.170
I want my kid to be a part of me, a part of us, you know?

24:57.210 --> 25:01.030
Yes, yeah, but you know, a lot of people come around to the idea of adoption

25:01.050 --> 25:07.340
Kevin...this is really...

25:07.400 --> 25:09.770
hard for me to say...

25:12.340 --> 25:16.730
but we want to use your sperm to get Julia pregnant.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.380
We're okay.

25:25.380 --> 25:26.570
I mean, that is really delicate.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.990
Yeah, I could barely form words, but I think I managed to let him down gently.

25:30.010 --> 25:33.270
-"Let him down gently"? 
- You did not. 
- Shut up.

25:33.350 --> 25:35.170
- You said no? 
- Are you being serious?

25:35.220 --> 25:38.020
Wh-what did you expect?

25:40.500 --> 25:43.520
How could you not want to help Julia and Tommy?

25:43.570 --> 25:45.680
Okay, take a minute, Sarah, and think this through.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.130
This does not fall within the parameters of normal brotherly duty.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.060
Since when has this been a normal family?

25:51.110 --> 25:54.710
Haven eaten a few meals with you people, I have to agree with Sarah on that point.

25:54.910 --> 25:57.080
Okay, I'm starting to regret that I ever told you.

25:57.140 --> 25:58.870
Yeah, so am I, Kevin.

25:59.430 --> 26:01.640
This isn't like you.

26:03.460 --> 26:06.670
Don't you find it the teeniest bit odd that you,

26:06.730 --> 26:09.550
a gay man, are suddenly embracing the idea of "normal?"

26:09.610 --> 26:10.890
You know, for once, Scotty,

26:10.930 --> 26:14.810
I would like to have an opinion without you connecting it to my sexuality.

26:14.850 --> 26:16.310
Slow down, Amber. It's okay.

26:16.390 --> 26:17.890
You can do this. You're--you're gonna be great.

26:17.930 --> 26:19.100
Oh, God, I think I might be having a panic attack.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.500
I mean, I've never had one before, so I don't know what it feels like,

26:21.540 --> 26:22.610
but I kind of think it feels like this, because I'm--

26:22.640 --> 26:25.690
Amber, take a deep breath. You're gonna be fine.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.860
I just don't want to come off like a stupid blonde.

26:27.940 --> 26:29.660
Well, you know what? That's great. Let him underestimate you.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.790
Work it to your advantage, and if he gives you that kind of pat,

26:32.820 --> 26:35.580
prescripted answer to a tough question, you just sit there.

26:35.650 --> 26:37.060
You don't say anything.

26:37.110 --> 26:41.370
He'll jump in to fill the silence, and that's when you'll really get him to reveal himself.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.670
You're, like, a total genius.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.090
Thank you so much, Kitty.

26:47.130 --> 26:48.290
You're welcome.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.640
- Oh, um, can you do me a favor? 
- Sure.

26:50.670 --> 26:54.370
Can you not mention this to Warren when he gets back from Vegas?

26:54.420 --> 26:59.390
I know it's silly, but I think we have a really good thing going between us,

26:59.450 --> 27:01.170
and I kind of want to impress him.

27:01.240 --> 27:05.700
I want him to think I'm smart, you know, like you.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.150
Sure.

27:07.230 --> 27:08.670
- Absolutely. 
- Thanks.

27:08.760 --> 27:10.170
And good luck.

27:11.690 --> 27:12.690
I've been thinking, you know,

27:12.690 --> 27:16.090
this may be my only chance in life for an actual literal roll in the hay.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.310
You lied about Amber. You told me that you ended it,

27:18.360 --> 27:20.910
but you didn't. She just called me.

27:20.960 --> 27:23.300
I'm sorry. Okay, I was going to.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.490
I went to do it, but she was over the moon about that stupid interview.

27:26.530 --> 27:28.510
Well, okay, so why didn't you just tell me that?

27:28.570 --> 27:29.790
Why did you have to lie about it?

27:29.840 --> 27:31.600
You've been lying since we walked in the front door.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.340
You know what? I'm not gonna be sneaking around

27:33.410 --> 27:36.040
behind the back of a 23-year-old girl,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.080
and I really hate it--

27:38.130 --> 27:41.490
I hate it that you put me in that position.

27:52.210 --> 27:55.580
I told you they would exhaust themselves, and they have.

27:55.610 --> 27:57.200
Justin, this is for you.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.460
What'd I tell ya? That is you, right?

28:00.650 --> 28:02.710
I don't know. Mom, you ever make me wear a bonnet?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.030
That's gotta be you.

28:04.060 --> 28:05.930
Tommy was 4 when dad got that car.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.600
I don't remember having such a squished face,

28:07.660 --> 28:09.310
but maybe one of you dropped me that day.

28:09.370 --> 28:11.210
Or maybe you fell out of a tree house naked.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.230
Yeah, the attic was taken.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.030
Joe?

28:15.100 --> 28:16.660
Justin, this isn't you.

28:16.730 --> 28:18.980
I don't know who it is-- some neighbor kid, I guess.

28:18.980 --> 28:19.980
Oh, you know what?

28:19.980 --> 28:21.110
Maybe it's that--that boy.

28:21.180 --> 28:22.250
What was his name?

28:22.300 --> 28:24.000
Uh, Tucker Booth.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.590
What?

28:28.510 --> 28:30.710
Julia, honey, are you all right?

28:31.300 --> 28:33.710
Hey, sweetie, let me-- let me take this.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.060
Are you happy now?

28:35.120 --> 28:36.570
- Excuse me? 
- You heard me.

28:36.620 --> 28:38.460
- Sarah, stop it. 
- What are you two fighting about?

28:38.500 --> 28:41.300
- We're not.
- I just think you're being selfish.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.110
Kevin, are you-- I can't believe you!

28:44.130 --> 28:46.470
I didn't-- I didn't bring this up. She did, okay?

28:46.520 --> 28:48.930
Tommy, you have no reason to feel weird.

28:48.980 --> 28:51.000
He's the one who should feel bad.

28:51.790 --> 28:53.270
Who should feel bad?

28:53.340 --> 28:55.820
Oh, God, Tommy!

28:55.870 --> 28:58.130
You asked him, didn't you?

28:58.170 --> 29:01.720
You asked Kevin for his sperm and didn't tell me?

29:06.590 --> 29:09.350
This is really wonderful pasta, Nora.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.750
Honey, I'm sorry, okay?

29:11.790 --> 29:14.410
I shouldn't have done it. I-I wanted it to be a surprise.

29:14.470 --> 29:16.300
Tommy, what the hell is going on?

29:16.360 --> 29:20.510
Is there something special about Kevin's sperm I'm unaware of?

29:24.690 --> 29:27.010
I'm sterile, Mom.

29:28.210 --> 29:30.340
I can't have kids.

29:30.460 --> 29:34.190
Oh, Tommy. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

29:36.970 --> 29:39.250
He asked Kevin to...

29:39.320 --> 29:41.580
help, but he doesn't want to.

29:41.630 --> 29:43.190
No, it's not that I don't want to help. I--

29:43.210 --> 29:46.840
Kevin's decided it's his role to save the traditional American family,

29:46.970 --> 29:49.360
which is kind of strange, since he's here with his boyfriend.

29:49.410 --> 29:50.540
Do you have any opinions on this, Kitty?

29:50.570 --> 29:52.320
'Cause I could sure use some help here.

29:52.360 --> 29:57.730
Well, you know, Kevin, I'm sorry, but I'm-- I don't necessarily agree with your views.

29:57.980 --> 29:59.960
Well, uh, you are a conservative.

30:00.010 --> 30:01.530
What about all the family values you spew?

30:01.580 --> 30:04.120
Well, you know, the last time I looked, Kevin, we're-- we're a family.

30:04.180 --> 30:05.270
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

30:05.340 --> 30:08.220
I don't think anyone is thinking about this kid but me.

30:08.290 --> 30:11.540
I'm a lawyer. I see this kind of thing every day, how it blows up in your face.

30:11.570 --> 30:15.010
Plus, we can't keep secrets in this family.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.030
How long would it be until his friends at school

30:17.080 --> 30:19.840
find out his biological dad is actually his gay uncle?

30:19.880 --> 30:20.970
I'm sorry, Kevin.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.730
You sound like you're channeling Jerry Falwell on Sunday mornings.

30:23.730 --> 30:24.850
Oh, come on.

30:24.850 --> 30:26.040
I know you don't agree with him, Scotty.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.260
You're more evolved than that.

30:28.380 --> 30:29.640
I don't.

30:29.670 --> 30:30.760
Scotty, please!

30:30.820 --> 30:33.790
This is my family. If you're not gonna support me, then shut up.

30:37.590 --> 30:38.940
I'm sorry.

30:38.990 --> 30:40.620
May I be excused from the table?

30:40.660 --> 30:41.660
- Yes. 
- Can I come?

30:41.660 --> 30:42.950
- Me, too. 
- And me.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.860
- Yeah, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna... 
- Grab the wine.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.020
We'll need more of that.

30:54.740 --> 31:02.190
Of all the madness I have ever witnessed from you, this takes the cake.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.300
Tommy, I am so sorry.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.300
I know how much it means to you to be a father.

31:07.370 --> 31:11.510
And, Kevin, if you don't want to help your brother, that's your business.

31:11.550 --> 31:14.340
It's not like you're asking him to borrow his car, for God's sakes.

31:14.390 --> 31:16.370
- But, Mom, it's-- 
- Sarah, you have no place to judge.

31:16.410 --> 31:18.000
No!

31:18.000 --> 31:19.810
I would have expected it from Kitty, not from--

31:19.860 --> 31:21.640
Thanks, Mother.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.770
I'm sorry.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.960
I'll--I'll help you, Tommy.

31:31.030 --> 31:33.080
I don't want your help.

31:33.150 --> 31:34.800
What is your problem, dude?

31:34.870 --> 31:36.090
What did I ever do to you?

31:36.140 --> 31:38.310
It's what you've done to yourself.

31:38.370 --> 31:40.760
If your brother wants to give you his sperm, I don't understand why--

31:40.840 --> 31:42.450
I didn't ask him, Mom.

31:42.510 --> 31:44.430
Yeah, because he's straight.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.400
You asked me 'cause you don't think I'm gonna have kids.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.450
Is that what you think, Kev?

31:47.540 --> 31:48.550
You think I asked you because you're gay?

31:48.620 --> 31:51.370
- Yes!
- You can have as many kids as you want.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.610
Look, I'm the one who can't.

31:59.460 --> 32:00.730
Well, I am, um--

32:00.780 --> 32:04.320
I'm sorry that the weekend didn't work out the way we planned.

32:04.370 --> 32:07.650
You know, the truth is, is I shouldn't have said yes to begin with.

32:07.710 --> 32:09.290
Maybe.

32:09.320 --> 32:12.000
Or maybe the truth is, if we were supposed to have happened,

32:12.000 --> 32:15.880
- we would have happened by now.
- Yeah.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.000
Scotty, please...

32:21.080 --> 32:23.620
Can we-- look, this is-- this is not good.

32:23.700 --> 32:24.710
C-come on.

32:24.770 --> 32:26.190
Don't be like this.

32:26.190 --> 32:27.250
Oh, so you're not only telling me what I should say,

32:27.250 --> 32:28.860
you're telling me how I should be, too?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.250
Oh, come on. That's not what I--

32:30.320 --> 32:31.870
c-could we please just talk about this?

32:31.930 --> 32:33.280
Warren's offered me a ride.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.320
If you want to talk, we'll talk back in L.A.

32:36.370 --> 32:37.470
Come on, please.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.220
Would you-- can we...

32:40.310 --> 32:41.900
Well, well, well.

32:42.020 --> 32:45.650
Well, I think I've succeeded in making everyone mad at me.

32:45.710 --> 32:47.570
I'm not mad at you.

32:52.340 --> 32:55.820
I can't believe you, of all people, don't think this is weird.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.190
You know, Kev...

33:02.790 --> 33:09.750
What Julia and Tommy want is the essence of family values

33:09.820 --> 33:11.960
and if i think that and I'm a Conservative,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.120
what-- where the hell are you coming from?

33:15.440 --> 33:19.480
You know, I don't talk a lot about what if was like for me growing up gay,

33:19.870 --> 33:21.970
but it wasn't easy.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.400
Yeah, you know, I was

33:24.500 --> 33:26.110
surrounded by all you guys

33:26.170 --> 33:28.600
this whole family, but...

33:28.990 --> 33:31.660
i still felt completely alone.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.030
I said no to Tommy 'cause

33:35.100 --> 33:37.470
I don't--I don't want to bring a kid into this world that would feel

33:37.490 --> 33:41.680
different or ashamed.

33:42.240 --> 33:44.240
I don't want him go though what I did.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.620
Whether it's your kid or whether it's Tommy's kid,

33:48.760 --> 33:49.870
it's...

33:49.920 --> 33:51.660
still gonna be a Walker.

33:54.250 --> 33:55.710
And, yeah, you know, you're right,

33:55.740 --> 33:57.650
we can't tell him not to feel ashamed

33:57.690 --> 33:59.730
or tell him not to feel scared of who he is,

33:59.800 --> 34:01.530
but,

34:01.700 --> 34:05.020
you know we can do our best to

34:05.070 --> 34:08.949
try and convince the next generation that they're perfect,

34:10.360 --> 34:12.929
exactly as they are.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.449
And if anybody has anything different to say, well

34:18.550 --> 34:20.100
then there's gonna be

34:20.159 --> 34:24.900
a whole clan of really pissed-off people coming after them.

34:25.570 --> 34:28.330
I got three. You only got two.

34:28.370 --> 34:29.850
You barely hit the bar twice.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.510
That's true.

34:34.190 --> 34:35.469
Good eye, Sis.

34:35.510 --> 34:40.170
This whole thing has been pushing buttons in me I didn't even know I had.

34:40.739 --> 34:42.969
I feel horrible.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.310
Why do you keep saying that?

34:44.420 --> 34:45.570
It's not your fault.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.659
Yes, it- it's happening because of me.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.100
I wanted to make it right.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.630
I wanted to come to you and say, "Look, Ii solved it. I made it better."

34:52.739 --> 34:55.440
I wanted to do at least that much.

34:56.110 --> 34:57.700
Hey, you.

34:57.740 --> 35:00.990
If you even knew half of what i thought of you,

35:01.090 --> 35:03.320
you'd be the proudest man alive.

35:04.910 --> 35:06.460
OK?

35:08.380 --> 35:10.500
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.640
Actually, I'm kinda hungry.

35:14.670 --> 35:16.940
I didn't really eat.

35:19.540 --> 35:20.540
Love you.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.140
I love you, too.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.400
Look, don't worry,

35:29.460 --> 35:32.200
I'm not here to bore you with my "getting-it-together" stories.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.110
And I didn't offer to help you tonight just to piss you off more.

35:35.640 --> 35:36.650
Look, Justin,

35:36.770 --> 35:38.610
I'm not pissed off, I'm just disappointed.

35:38.690 --> 35:39.910
I'm sorry, but,

35:39.990 --> 35:42.690
I've given up trying to figure out you and your problems.

35:42.750 --> 35:45.160
Look, Tommy, I need you to understand me,

35:45.190 --> 35:47.230
OK?

35:52.940 --> 35:56.090
Look, one night, my last month in Afghanistan,

35:56.290 --> 36:00.060
another medic, this guy Doug, and me, went out with this squad of Rangers.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.540
I followed a platoon into the enemy's position just to see if there was anybody alive.

36:04.590 --> 36:08.050
Anyway, we went into this, ah,

36:08.150 --> 36:10.830
this bunker or this cave

36:11.000 --> 36:12.830
and there was all these bodies,

36:12.890 --> 36:14.550
and they were all dead,

36:14.630 --> 36:16.390
except for this one guy, who,

36:16.470 --> 36:18.560
two minutes ago was trying to kill me.

36:18.630 --> 36:21.480
I mean, his eyes were just staring at me.

36:22.290 --> 36:24.870
Not mean, though, just like,

36:28.860 --> 36:30.950
just like, "help me."

36:33.990 --> 36:37.930
And I was staring right at him, and ah,

36:41.780 --> 36:43.740
I didn't do anything.

36:47.180 --> 36:48.510
I let him die, Tommy.

36:48.610 --> 36:51.360
I mean, he was a human being and I just let him die.

36:54.470 --> 36:56.630
It's why I wanna do this for you,

36:56.900 --> 36:59.210
I want to do this for me.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.890
I owe a life.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.180
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.900
Seems like I'm always apologizing for my family.

37:21.930 --> 37:24.310
You have nothing to apologize for.

37:24.680 --> 37:30.360
Oh, please. If they're not falling out of trees, then they're killing each other over sperm.

37:31.320 --> 37:33.030
It sure it beats my family.

37:33.170 --> 37:35.410
We barely even talk to each other.

37:35.510 --> 37:38.160
Were you married? I never even asked.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.800
For ten years.

37:41.330 --> 37:43.430
Some things aren't meant to be.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.500
Am I...

37:46.710 --> 37:49.680
- crazy or...?
- No.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.310
You're not crazy.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.810
I'm shaking.

38:17.610 --> 38:19.270
We should go, Mom.

38:20.170 --> 38:22.210
Dave's waiting.

38:22.290 --> 38:26.070
I don't know how the three of us are gonna fit in that truck with everything I've piled in there, so

38:26.160 --> 38:28.720
I'll sit in the middle, give you more leg-room.

38:28.800 --> 38:32.830
You know, Mom, if you really want to sit next to Dave, you should just say so.

38:33.990 --> 38:36.380
All right, I want to sit next to David.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.580
OK, let's go.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.470
Goodbye, House.

38:47.290 --> 38:50.420
I hope whoever buys it appreciates how special it is.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.470
Oh, I don't know.

38:52.780 --> 38:57.470
I think its charms might be lost on anybody who didn't grow up spending their summers here.

38:58.150 --> 39:00.920
Well, it sure is beautiful to me.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.960
Justin was conceived here.

39:02.990 --> 39:04.140
Really?

39:04.220 --> 39:07.660
Huh, well, that's a little more information than I could usually handle, but

39:07.740 --> 39:10.760
i guess since we've been talking about sperm all weekend, um

39:10.860 --> 39:13.320
it's OK.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.940
I was hoping it would be lucky for Tommy and Julia, too.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.500
Yeah.

39:23.430 --> 39:24.680
Wait.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.360
What are you doing?

39:29.450 --> 39:32.360
We're gonna leave one last mark on this old house.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.420
- Oh, Mother, don't be silly.
- Get over here!

39:33.420 --> 39:34.520
Stand up straight.

39:34.550 --> 39:36.530
- Come on. 
- What?

39:38.720 --> 39:39.940
Feet all the way in!

39:40.020 --> 39:45.660
- If anyone is gonna leave a mark in this house, it is going to be you, Nora Walker.
- OK.

39:51.200 --> 39:55.870
Wow. Look how much you've grown.

40:01.050 --> 40:02.980
Couldn't figure out who that was.

40:03.500 --> 40:06.160
What's up? You look like you just saw a ghost.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.170
Do you know who that is?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.530
Saul?

40:09.620 --> 40:11.400
Who is that?

40:16.740 --> 40:20.220
Saul, did Dad...

40:20.860 --> 40:22.380
Did Dad and Holly have...?

40:22.480 --> 40:25.920
Holly never made any claims for child support.

40:26.450 --> 40:30.820
and your father certainly never breathed a word about having a child with Holly.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.320
Does Holly have a child?

40:33.380 --> 40:35.230
Yes.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.950
Holly has a daughter,

40:38.050 --> 40:42.110
and I don't think anyone's interests are being served by idle speculation about paternity.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.240
Oh, I don't think it's idle.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.900
What's her name?

40:49.650 --> 40:52.300
Saul, what's Holly's daugher's name?

40:57.390 --> 40:59.350
Rebecca.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.430
Damn.

41:03.530 --> 41:05.050
How did everything go?

41:05.140 --> 41:07.400
Oh, it was fine. Thank you, Ma'am.

41:08.110 --> 41:09.550
And you?

41:09.630 --> 41:10.770
Fine, thank you.

41:10.830 --> 41:13.210
Incidentally, I appreciate your support for gay cinema.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.650
We aim to please.

41:14.710 --> 41:17.200
Now, if you could all just fill out these forms--

41:17.270 --> 41:19.980
and we'll never know which one of them is--

41:20.020 --> 41:21.880
That's the plan.

41:22.260 --> 41:23.710
Good luck.

41:23.790 --> 41:25.240
It was very nice meeting all of you.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.850
Thank you.

41:27.680 --> 41:30.300
OK, I cannot live with the fact she knew exactly what I was doing in there.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.050
It's almost as bad as the time when Mom walked in...

41:32.170 --> 41:33.900
Woah! Woah! Woah!

41:37.340 --> 41:38.500
She's looking at me.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.090
Fill out your form.

41:41.830 --> 41:43.780
You know, this whole anonymity thing's a joke.

41:43.850 --> 41:45.770
Cause if the kid is well-dressed and witty, it's mine.

41:45.810 --> 41:47.030
You don't stand a chance!

41:47.070 --> 41:48.370
My little dude's have been to war.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.260
And stoned for the last ten years.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.280
Mine are effective.

41:51.370 --> 41:53.670
OK, that's enough sperm talk for the rest of my life.

41:53.740 --> 41:55.990
I've got some time to kill. You wanna grab a bite?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
Sure. Why not?

41:57.030 --> 41:58.430
You're not gonna ask us for a kidney or anything, are you?

41:58.510 --> 42:01.410
I wouldn't touch your kidney with a ten-foot pole.
