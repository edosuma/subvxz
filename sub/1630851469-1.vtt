00:22.080 --> 00:26.360
<i>When powerful men</i>
<i>set themselves against the truth...</i>

00:28.680 --> 00:29.960
<i>they must be stopped.</i>

00:34.880 --> 00:36.560
Your former boss,

00:36.640 --> 00:40.840
his stated aim was to achieve
permanent unrest in Europe.

00:43.800 --> 00:44.960
I love the English.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.840
Always pointing at everyone else.
Their finger dripping with blood.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.480
Can we get down to business?

00:52.080 --> 00:54.360
Business. Yes.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.160
Red spider.

00:58.240 --> 00:59.520
Redspider.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.720
Redback. The female's bite is deadly.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.560
She also indulges
in sexual cannibalism.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.240
Alex.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.760
What does it mean?

01:10.840 --> 01:12.000
You're retiring.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.480
Next month.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.960
Look at this.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.640
Four bedrooms.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.040
Snooker room in the basement.
Heated pool.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.240
You could sign off on this
before you quit.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.240
From now on
everything goes through Beatrice.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.400
What does Redback mean?

01:31.680 --> 01:32.560
You want to know?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.480
Call the estate agent. Make an offer.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.360
You got here before us.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.240
So?

01:42.320 --> 01:45.200
So, if you'd taken even the most
basic counter-surveillance measures,

01:45.280 --> 01:46.400
you'd have arrived late.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.440
You think I don't know
if I'm being tailed?

01:49.440 --> 01:51.040
Twenty-seven years
in the fucking KGB.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.480
You're slack.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.320
And as your intelligence declines,
your entitlement soars.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.720
Redback is the code name

02:00.800 --> 02:04.640
for a major terror attack
on British soil.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.360
-Now you're ready to deal.
-Who are we talking about? When?

02:12.200 --> 02:15.280
Rieper Hansen.
Major Danish multinational.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.880
I've heard of Rieper Hansen.

02:16.960 --> 02:20.600
They're building a nuclear power
station for the Scottish Government.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.080
Alex, it's built.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.120
-Opens this week.
-What's the connection with Redback?

02:28.760 --> 02:29.680
I don't know.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.840
You don't know?

02:31.440 --> 02:34.320
The name came up.
You get more when I get my house.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.080
And you better be quick.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.760
And if you think
this is just about the house,

02:41.680 --> 02:43.120
I need another handler.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.840
Well, he must have something
if he's demanding a house.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.200
-Perhaps.
-Oh, I played that wrong.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.560
Alexander is a narcissist.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.080
We all are.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.280
He just needs
to be made to feel special.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.400
But never let him forget
who's in charge.

03:10.920 --> 03:11.960
Look at his hands.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.080
Man down. Tull Lane.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.040
Lone actor. CBRN threat.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.280
Operationally capable.
Seal the area now.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.000
This was block 17.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.000
I will throw the bottle.

05:28.560 --> 05:29.960
Everyone will die.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.080
I doubt you want to die.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.520
I doubt you have a gun.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.760
But you are not sure.

06:31.080 --> 06:31.920
Fuck!

06:38.680 --> 06:39.640
Glen?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.040
Beatrice, Code blue.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.480
<i>Get everyone out of here.</i>

06:44.880 --> 06:46.120
Evacuate the building.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.560
Don't open the doors.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.480
<i>Don't open the doors.</i>

06:51.560 --> 06:52.440
Evacuate!

06:53.640 --> 06:55.160
Glen, open the doors!

06:56.200 --> 06:57.000
Glen!

07:00.240 --> 07:02.920
Glen!

07:10.800 --> 07:12.320
It's poisonous. Clear the building.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.080
What are you waiting for?
Everybody, move! Now!

08:32.240 --> 08:34.480
<i>As you see behind me here,</i>
<i>the shopping center,</i>

08:34.560 --> 08:37.640
<i>where yesterday's attack took place,</i>
<i>remains closed.</i>

08:37.720 --> 08:40.240
<i>We have news</i>
<i>that people admitted to hospital</i>

08:40.320 --> 08:42.400
<i>with breathing difficulties</i>
<i>have now been released...</i>

08:42.480 --> 08:43.280
Hi.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.160
<i>...but no further news</i>

08:44.240 --> 08:46.000
<i>on the identities</i>
<i>of the two fatalities.</i>

08:46.080 --> 08:47.600
Shouldn't you be out there?

08:48.080 --> 08:49.440
Probably.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.920
<i>And now we go live to Downing Street</i>

08:51.000 --> 08:53.360
<i>where the Prime Minister</i>
<i>is about to make a statement.</i>

08:53.960 --> 08:55.000
I think that's your cue.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.480
I don't think
they'll start without me.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.480
Over here, if you would.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.080
Good morning, everybody.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.760
So, what have you got?

09:21.960 --> 09:24.480
Alexander Kutiev was bugged.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.160
The pathologist found an AU32
in the lining of his jacket.

09:27.240 --> 09:31.200
So, whoever killed him knows what we
know which is pretty much fuck all.

09:32.080 --> 09:34.560
Danish conglomerate
and something called Redback.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.160
This was in his flat.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.880
And either this is the newspaper
Mr. Kutiev was reading

09:42.960 --> 09:44.840
when he got the communiquÃ©

09:44.920 --> 09:47.720
or this is a terror attack
on our Prime Minister.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.920
Alex Kutiev
was not a man who played games.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.440
If he called a meeting,
he had something to impart.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.360
So why are we reduced
to this conjecture?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.040
Beatrice?

10:01.960 --> 10:05.160
Well, whatever he had
he was using it as leverage.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.320
For what?

10:07.080 --> 10:08.280
He wanted a better house.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.840
He wanted a better house.
What a bastard.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.240
A man who imperiled his life
for this country

10:14.320 --> 10:17.400
and here we are
for the sake of a few quid,

10:17.480 --> 10:19.360
with our heads up our arses,

10:19.440 --> 10:23.080
waiting for some monumental
goatfuck to kick off!

10:27.520 --> 10:29.080
And we are stronger than ever

10:29.160 --> 10:32.440
in our determination
to defeat terrorism.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.840
We will never allow violence
to change our values.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.280
-Prime Minister?
-Yes. Jonathan?

10:40.080 --> 10:41.520
Given messages of support

10:41.600 --> 10:44.720
for the attack
from Scottish Nationalist Extremists,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.080
can you discount their involvement?

10:47.960 --> 10:50.040
We live in volatile times.
I'm not discounting anything.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.960
What will the ramifications be
about Scotland in the referendum?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.760
Was it a terrorist attack?

10:58.920 --> 11:00.600
As some of you know

11:00.680 --> 11:05.200
that the DG has ordered
that no one from this department

11:06.000 --> 11:08.960
attend Glen's funeral.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.960
He asked me
to say a few words instead.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.240
But, um,

11:16.480 --> 11:19.200
I can hear
Glen's voice now saying,

11:19.280 --> 11:20.960
"What are you doing? Get on with it.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.800
Get on with the job."

11:24.480 --> 11:26.000
So, no eulogies.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.480
You are now Team Redback.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.960
You discuss this operation
with no one outside this enclave.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.080
Your mission is to find out

11:35.160 --> 11:38.760
what Alexander Kutiev meant
by Redback

11:39.680 --> 11:41.000
and to prevent it.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.560
And to hunt down

11:44.440 --> 11:46.080
and bring to justice

11:47.680 --> 11:49.720
the man who killed our friend.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.920
We honor Glen Whitelaw

11:55.800 --> 11:57.000
with our actions.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.920
What do we have, Beatrice?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.120
Glen and Alexander Kutiev

12:09.200 --> 12:11.800
were killed from inhalation
of the VX nerve agent.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.520
We're mapping the chemical trace.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.520
And the assailant?

12:17.400 --> 12:20.360
Nothing yet,
but we'll be on it round the clock.

12:20.960 --> 12:27.040
Well, we do know that he's not new
to this from the CCTV footage, so

12:28.680 --> 12:31.520
Find the Redback trail,
find the killer.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.600
Thank you.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.920
Hi, honey.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.200
Hi!

13:04.360 --> 13:05.680
It smells good.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.320
Thanks.

13:10.040 --> 13:10.920
Hey?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.640
What about the wine bar?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.600
I already told you.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.080
The power plant has to work in

13:18.720 --> 13:21.000
two days.
I need to authorize the codes.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.880
You work all the time.
We never see each other.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.400
Maybe wine is not
the best idea right now.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.640
Fine.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.160
Katrine.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.720
-What?
-We talked about it.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.240
Hey...

13:39.280 --> 13:40.080
Here.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.080
Come on. Eat.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.880
-I'm trying.
-Do you trust me?

14:35.240 --> 14:36.520
Torben Jensen.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.120
<i>User identification nummer?</i>

14:39.600 --> 14:41.400
Six, nine,

14:41.920 --> 14:44.920
four, two, eight, three.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.680
<i>Welcome to Riber Hansen.</i>

14:49.720 --> 14:52.000
-Wait, don't come in.
-I have you dinner...

14:53.000 --> 14:54.040
Just put it there.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.040
-Torben?
-Just let me finish.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.240
Torben?

15:27.840 --> 15:28.880
William.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.000
Levi.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.080
You wanted to speak to me?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.600
White to move, made in three.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.760
I haven't played in years.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.800
When I was 12 a Russian grandmaster
came to our school.

15:51.840 --> 15:54.840
Mikhail Botvinnik.
Former World Champion.

15:54.920 --> 15:58.080
Played 50 of the best
young English chess players.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.280
Played us simultaneously.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.240
Blindfold.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.360
That puts you in check.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.720
Called out the moves.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.720
Board 11 knight, king's bishop three.

16:10.800 --> 16:15.320
Board 42, rook take pawn, C6.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.360
Check!

16:19.080 --> 16:20.640
Won 49, lost one.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.200
Did you apply for Glen's job?

16:29.640 --> 16:30.520
No.

16:32.040 --> 16:35.120
-Uh, I just assumed...
-You assumed it'd go to Beatrice.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.000
Yeah.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.680
Well, it might,
but it shouldn't be a shoo-in.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.160
Well, I'll put my name in.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.280
Don't hang about.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.120
Were you the one
who beat the grandmaster?

16:57.080 --> 16:57.880
Yeah.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.920
Queen's sacrifice
won me the game.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.400
<i>You've called Torben Jensen.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

17:21.440 --> 17:23.520
Hi, honey, it's me.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.440
I need my morning coffee.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.560
I can't start my day without it,
so...

17:32.760 --> 17:33.760
Bye.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.040
Hi, Peter.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.080
Hi, Katrine here.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.280
Is Torben with you?

17:47.440 --> 17:50.960
Could you ask him to call me
if you see him?

17:51.680 --> 17:52.600
Thanks.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.280
His computer?

17:57.440 --> 17:58.480
Yes, it's here.

18:54.840 --> 18:55.640
Yes.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.480
There's a girl here...

19:09.400 --> 19:11.240
We're on. We're going to Denmark.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.320
-When?
-Now.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.840
Comms got a flag
from Rieper Hansen in Denmark.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.000
Their head of Cyber Security's
gone AWOL.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.240
Something to do
with that Scottish power station?

19:21.320 --> 19:24.120
Well, that was why we got the flag,
but there's more.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.000
This guy, Torben Jensen.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.000
-Head of Cyber...
-Yeah.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.440
He's disappeared and stolen a process
for the creation of biofuels.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.720
BF 100.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.840
It's cheap, easy to manufacture
and extremely dangerous.

19:37.440 --> 19:38.320
Redback?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.920
Could be the information
Alexander Kutiev withheld.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.480
So, I've set up a meeting
with Peter Corg

19:43.560 --> 19:46.280
who's Rieper Hansen's
Copenhagen's CEO.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.280
So, if you take that.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.080
I'm gonna be parlaying
with Torben Jensen's girlfriend.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.200
-Do you think she's involved?
-Yeah.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.240
I think she's absolutely involved.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.920
She's Danish Secret Service.
I've requisitioned her file.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.080
Could be tricky, Secret Service.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.560
Danish Secret Service.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.040
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.440
-Hi.
-Hi, Mikkel.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.640
What are you doing here?

20:28.080 --> 20:29.600
I need Torben's work computer.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.120
Where is it?

20:31.760 --> 20:33.000
It's up here.

20:37.760 --> 20:39.720
CO Riber Hansen.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.480
Something happened to Torben?

20:41.560 --> 20:42.560
I don't know.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.800
-What's going on?
-I don't know, sorry.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.000
What's going on?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.400
Huh?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.560
The codes, Torben worked on,

20:49.640 --> 20:52.360
his boss is worried
they have been compromised.

20:52.440 --> 20:57.760
If anyone touches that computer,
the security system picks it up.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.200
They would have noticed
issues with the codes.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.840
Peter? I'm here with Katrine
Poulsen. The computer is here.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.760
It's closed down.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.640
He's asking who closed it down?

21:12.880 --> 21:13.960
Torben did.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
Good. She says it's Torben.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.880
Peter, let's meet at the station.
I'll bring the computer.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.640
Okay, bye.

21:24.760 --> 21:25.640
The station?

21:26.560 --> 21:27.440
Yeah.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.800
I'd like you to come
to the police station.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.720
I can't. Torben is gone.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.040
They're looking for him.
They need your help.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.920
Peter said the codes were ok.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.640
It's not only about the codes.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.480
-Come on.
-Okay.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.120
Katrine Poulsen.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.120
Eight years on the job.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.520
Fluent in five languages.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.560
Her younger sister died last year.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.680
Looks like Poulsen
pretty much brought her up.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.560
Can you show me cafes close
to Copenhagen central police station?

22:10.480 --> 22:11.840
Does this ever work?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.040
It always works.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.040
Beatrice Ogilvy.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.840
For Katrine Poulsen?

22:32.920 --> 22:34.640
I spoke to you from the airport.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.520
We're really wasting time here.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.040
I mean, treating me as a suspect.
That's insane.

22:47.960 --> 22:49.400
My partner, he's missing.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.120
I should be looking for him.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.720
And you
should be looking for him, too.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.040
If you walk now,
the police will arrest you.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.200
How did Torben
seem to you last night?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.600
He seemed
very much the same as always.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.800
Please.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.400
It must have been a shock
finding him gone.

23:18.960 --> 23:23.000
Establish a bond.
Understand. But don't dominate.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.920
You're gonna do the whole manual?

23:27.320 --> 23:30.160
Look, Torben had access
to highly sensitive research,

23:30.240 --> 23:32.320
including the BF 100 process.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.720
Yeah, but I've never heard
of a BF anything.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.440
Well, it was downloaded to his phone.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.480
Now, as head of Cyber Security,

23:38.560 --> 23:40.640
he's the only member of staff
who could have done that.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.160
Me and Torben, we have a rule.
We don't talk about work.

23:46.360 --> 23:47.320
Thanks.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.680
Excuse me?
There are lumps floating around.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.880
My coffee is lumpy.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.240
Could I get a new one?

23:58.320 --> 24:02.680
What are you doing? Give me a new
one! How fucking hard can... Sorry.

24:04.840 --> 24:06.640
Why am I being treated as a suspect?

24:06.720 --> 24:09.000
I wrote a list of Torben's friends
for the police.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.200
Very helpful.

24:10.280 --> 24:13.480
It would have been a lot more helpful
if you just told them where he is.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.560
OK. Seriously?

24:16.040 --> 24:18.560
You expect me to believe that you
don't talk about work?

24:18.640 --> 24:20.520
I mean,
the resentment you must feel.

24:20.600 --> 24:22.560
You should be promoted by now,
shouldn't you?

24:23.440 --> 24:25.240
One pay rise in six years.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.440
And then suddenly Torben mentions
this process that's worth millions.

24:29.520 --> 24:31.880
You joke about stealing it,
selling it.

24:33.440 --> 24:38.040
It's funny at first and Torben
plays along. Who would buy it?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.840
A rival company maybe.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.880
But here's the thing. It's more
than a process. It's a weapon.

24:44.960 --> 24:49.280
Its ingredients are easily accessed
and it's incredibly powerful.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.920
And, now, Katrine,
in our line of work,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.320
we know people
who'll pay a lot of money for this.

24:53.880 --> 24:57.000
And we know how to contact them
and we know how to cover our tracks.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.320
But Torben,
he's the only person I know

24:59.400 --> 25:01.480
who's never stolen a thing
in his life.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.480
Thanks.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
What the fuck is that?

25:11.280 --> 25:13.280
Okay, take it easy.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.760
Honestly?

25:15.400 --> 25:17.240
My god...

25:19.080 --> 25:20.320
Is this why Torben dumped you?

25:21.320 --> 25:22.760
Your shocking temper.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.240
You must have been
a lot of fun to live with.

25:25.320 --> 25:28.160
This is a category 1
terrorism offence.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.840
OK? It carries a minimum of 35 years.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.240
If you cooperate now,
we can turn this round.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.200
Thanks.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.160
I've changed my mind.

25:45.480 --> 25:46.960
Whoopsie.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.800
I thought you were starving.

26:04.880 --> 26:05.960
Hi.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.120
I'm satisfied that Miss Poulsen
had nothing to do

26:08.200 --> 26:09.560
with the IP theft on Rieper Hansen.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.960
-I'll pass it on.
-Thanks.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.920
Oh, I'm sorry about your boss.

26:24.000 --> 26:24.840
What?

26:25.400 --> 26:26.840
Glen Whitelaw.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.920
It wasn't your fault.

26:34.080 --> 26:35.080
Bitch.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.000
Think she's nothing to do with it?

26:40.080 --> 26:41.320
She's up to her neck in it.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.000
If we put a trace on her,
she'll lead us straight to Torben.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.520
How did you get on at Rieper Hansen?

26:49.600 --> 26:51.640
His boss seemed genuinely shocked.

26:52.320 --> 26:56.560
"Torben Jensen would never steal.
Somebody must be threatening him."

26:57.680 --> 26:58.840
Well, did he say who?

26:58.920 --> 27:01.000
Couldn't come up with a single name.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.160
Sculpting with smoke.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.200
That's how Glen
used to describe the job.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.080
Three hours before the next flight.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.480
Well, I know a good cafe.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.000
Had a chat with the boss today.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.080
Yeah? About what?

27:34.640 --> 27:35.600
Chess.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.640
We had a right old chinwag.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.560
Him and Glen used to play for money.

27:44.640 --> 27:46.960
They'd hustle all the old boys
in Holland Park.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.440
You see, that's what
he should have talked about.

27:49.520 --> 27:53.560
This whole "no eulogies" thing, it's
a bit harsh.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.880
Glen kept us together.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.680
Katrine's left the police station.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.200
And we're tracking her.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.040
Looks like she's going home.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.840
She's gonna know she's been hacked.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.480
Yeah, 'course she does,
but does she ditch her phone?

28:12.560 --> 28:14.920
Makes her look guilty if she does.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.440
But if she knows she's been hacked
and doesn't ditch her phone,

28:17.520 --> 28:19.040
is she trying to manipulate us?

28:20.800 --> 28:21.800
Head fuck.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.360
Yes, it is.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.640
Even on a day like this,

28:33.720 --> 28:36.480
they have to make it
about the Scottish Nationalists.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.520
Well, it's a problem of your
own making, but easily solved.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.000
Make good on my promise.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.080
Exactly. Let the Scots
have their referendum.

28:45.160 --> 28:48.000
It'll be over in two weeks,
then we get on with what's important.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.000
Two weeks.

28:49.760 --> 28:51.760
I don't know. Two, three weeks.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.520
You did promise agile government,
accelerated legislation.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.880
The polls are excellent. Do it now.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.720
What a surprise. You're still up.

29:05.720 --> 29:06.520
Good do?

29:07.080 --> 29:07.960
Hellish.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.560
What are you two talking about?

29:13.120 --> 29:14.920
Well, I can wait.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.720
Adam is going to give the Scots their
referendum.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.600
What? When?

29:24.120 --> 29:26.040
It's not 100 percent.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.320
No, it is 100 percent.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.040
I know that look.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.160
-What happened to plan B?
-Plan B?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.600
Adam resigns and lets someone

29:34.680 --> 29:38.120
who didn't make the second worse
promise of all time take over.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.560
Oh, my God.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.560
Plan B was a joke.

29:47.440 --> 29:48.640
What about the Scots?

29:48.720 --> 29:50.960
The Scots. They had their chance.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.400
You know, if you lose,
there's a special circle in hell,

29:54.480 --> 29:56.040
just for you and David Cameron?

29:56.760 --> 29:58.240
I made a promise.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.680
But, Adam, don't you think with the
upheaval of the last couple of years,

30:01.760 --> 30:04.480
that people just deserve
a little bit of stability?

30:05.200 --> 30:06.040
Yes.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.280
And this will give it to them.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.080
I'm not gonna take the easy way out.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.200
No.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.520
You never do.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.000
Declan, man.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.080
Did that turn into an all-nighter?

30:49.160 --> 30:50.040
Yeah.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.920
I thought you might need.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.360
Oh, cheers, bro.

31:05.680 --> 31:09.240
It feels strange.
Glen's usually first in.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.240
Yeah.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.120
You could talk to Glen.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.720
Did you?

31:17.200 --> 31:19.200
Ever, like, talk to him?

31:19.760 --> 31:21.320
No. Not talk.

31:22.120 --> 31:24.320
-But you felt you could.
-Yeah.

31:25.920 --> 31:26.720
What's happening?

31:28.640 --> 31:31.160
Katrine's still in Copenhagen,
but she's on the move.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.680
She's been busy.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.120
Coffee machine still ain't working.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.280
Couldn't get hold of Maintenance.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.000
Now, this came in ten minutes ago.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.680
An ATM in Harwich and that's Torben
Jensen's debit card being used.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.000
Torben's in the house.

31:47.080 --> 31:50.000
Well, his card is.
Have you got any clearer images?

31:50.080 --> 31:51.760
Not yet, no. I have looked.

31:51.840 --> 31:55.000
But this guy didn't take cash out.
He just checked his balance.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.040
He's waiting on his biofuels wonga.

31:57.120 --> 31:58.800
But why isn't his account frozen?

31:58.880 --> 32:01.200
In case he do be stupid enough
to talk into a bank.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.240
And looking at this, he might be.

32:03.320 --> 32:05.520
If he's in Harwich,
he's taken a ferry.

32:05.600 --> 32:08.080
Didn't come via Copenhagen.
I checked.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.000
Drove to Hamburg, Rotterdam.
Took a ferry from there?

32:11.960 --> 32:12.760
For you.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.080
Oh, where's yours?

32:16.160 --> 32:18.160
I had one. I drank it.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.920
Thanks, Marcus.

32:20.680 --> 32:21.560
Where's mine?

32:22.680 --> 32:23.920
You snooze, you lose.

32:24.760 --> 32:28.160
Mate, I ain't snoozing,
I'm right here. Where's my coffee?

32:28.240 --> 32:31.960
Mate, you snooze, you lose.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.720
Just make sure you're not licking the
wrong arse, yeah?

32:37.280 --> 32:39.160
Right, so, what did Poulsen do
all night?

32:39.240 --> 32:43.160
I mean, if she's creating
this dumped girlfriend legend,

32:43.240 --> 32:46.840
she's being pretty thorough, right?
She went to 17 different addresses.

32:46.920 --> 32:49.240
Now, I have pulled deets
on the people she saw

32:49.320 --> 32:51.520
and they're all connected
to Torben Jensen.

32:51.600 --> 32:55.400
Work colleagues, university friends.
This is chess clubs dweebs.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.560
Good work.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.280
And... Ah, you're gonna like this.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.960
An hour ago,
she booked a flight to London.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.360
-Switch to video.
-Yeah.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.120
She is coming for you.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.760
I very much hope so.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.840
When I first ran for Parliament
nine years ago,

33:23.840 --> 33:28.480
trust in politicians
was at its lowest in 100 years.

33:30.400 --> 33:35.560
I told people, "If you vote for me,
I will always be honest."

33:37.160 --> 33:41.160
Now, there will be times
when what I say won't be popular,

33:42.040 --> 33:44.920
but it will always be the truth.

33:47.840 --> 33:51.560
Part of being honest is making
promises and then keeping them.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.920
Before the last election,

33:54.760 --> 34:00.120
I promised the people of Scotland
a referendum on independence.

34:02.000 --> 34:07.640
Today, I stand before you
to make good on that promise.

34:08.720 --> 34:11.240
<i>I will be campaigning vigorously</i>

34:11.320 --> 34:13.400
<i>to persuade people</i>
<i>north of the border...</i>

34:14.920 --> 34:15.720
Come.

34:15.800 --> 34:20.000
<i>...that their security,</i>
<i>their prosperity and their future...</i>

34:20.080 --> 34:21.000
Seen this?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.040
<i>...is brighter</i>

34:23.120 --> 34:25.560
<i>-from within the United Kingdom.</i>
<i>-Oh, yeah.</i>

34:28.720 --> 34:33.440
Got this from across the river.
St. Thomas Aquinas College in Wukari.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.600
A hundred and sixty-three people
incinerated in 30 seconds.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.120
Daesh?

34:40.200 --> 34:43.760
Nigerian police finally published
the results of their investigation.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.560
Sent it to the Home Secretary,
as well, helpfully.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.200
Turns out it wasn't a bomb.

34:49.360 --> 34:51.280
It was a biofuels attack.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.000
Yeah. So...

34:54.520 --> 34:57.040
Now we have Zac Clark
asking about biofuels as a weapon.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.240
Wants a progress report every six
hours.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.680
Which he'll never read.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.080
Nonetheless, I need you
to redouble your efforts.

35:10.440 --> 35:12.000
Has Poulsen landed?

35:12.760 --> 35:14.320
Katrine ordered an Uber.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.760
She's on her way
to 181a Chasewell Road.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.680
Home to Torben's ex-wife,
Bryony Macfour.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.280
Right, have we got access
to Macfour's phone and laptop?

35:21.360 --> 35:22.280
Yes. Cleared.

35:22.360 --> 35:24.000
Link up and image. Patch it through.

35:24.880 --> 35:26.960
Declan, get a couple
of SFOs down there.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.120
If she incriminates herself,
I want her in custody.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.240
But tell them discretion, alright?
We don't want her spooked.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.280
Can you get it up on the main screen?

35:34.360 --> 35:35.520
It's up.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.680
Alright, what am I looking at here?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.920
That's coming
from Katrine Poulsen's phone.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.800
-Can you crank up the vol?
-Yeah.

35:46.400 --> 35:47.200
Marcus!

35:47.280 --> 35:48.720
Sorry, sorry.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.000
-What are you doing?
-Where's Torben?

35:55.080 --> 35:55.920
Can you stop that?

35:57.080 --> 35:58.000
Where is Torben?

35:58.080 --> 35:59.360
Torben isn't here. Hey!

36:00.000 --> 36:01.360
When did he last contact you?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.560
SFOs are on the way.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.640
<i>-I don't know. A year ago?</i>
<i>-You're lying.</i>

36:04.720 --> 36:07.040
You think I don't check his phone?
He called you last week.

36:07.120 --> 36:09.680
OK, but he's not here now.
I'm phoning the police.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.960
What did you talk about?

36:12.040 --> 36:14.600
Nothing. We chatted.
We had a relationship before you...

36:15.080 --> 36:18.000
Shit. Take the phone
out of your pocket.

36:19.240 --> 36:21.960
-And patch through to Bryony's phone?
-I'm on it.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.000
Come on, come on.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.440
There you go.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.760
<i>-You think I give a shit about that?</i>
-Slightly better.

36:28.840 --> 36:31.360
<i>-Just tell me what you talked about.</i>
<i>-We talked about you.</i>

36:31.440 --> 36:33.040
-About me?
-You're a nightmare.

36:33.120 --> 36:34.360
<i>Oh, that's bullshit.</i>

36:34.480 --> 36:37.280
-Are you buying this?
-The nightmare part, yeah.

36:37.360 --> 36:41.160
Torben, he fucked up
and I'm gonna end up in jail,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.840
so can you please just tell me
what the hell did you talk about?

36:43.920 --> 36:45.080
Who the hell are you?

36:46.520 --> 36:48.040
Holy shit! Who's that?

36:48.120 --> 36:49.240
Stop!

36:51.240 --> 36:52.080
God!

36:53.320 --> 36:54.440
Get off!

36:55.080 --> 36:57.600
-Alright. SFOs, outside now.
-Whoa, whoa.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.200
Help!

37:01.920 --> 37:03.600
OK, stand by, SFO.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.080
What the...

37:09.160 --> 37:10.880
You asked for a boyfriend betray you.

37:11.680 --> 37:15.200
And where are you going? Make a move
and I'll chop your fucking spine up.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.520
-Got radio contact with that team?
-Yes.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.880
-Tell them to get in there!
-No.

37:23.840 --> 37:26.800
This is bullshit.
And I make a call when I'm in charge.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.040
No.

37:29.120 --> 37:31.240
-Beatrice!
-She'll tell him.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.920
-No.
-Where is he?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.080
-He's gonna kill her.
-Wait!

37:36.160 --> 37:37.200
-No. Declan...
-Wait.

37:40.480 --> 37:43.000
Where is he? Where is he?

37:44.080 --> 37:46.320
Shit. Right. Give me.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Go. Class 7. IC 1, male,
assumed armed with nerve agent.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.880
Where is he?

37:53.560 --> 37:55.480
Affirmative. Class 7.
I'm authorising it.

37:55.560 --> 37:57.320
It's the bastard who killed Glen.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.760
Get on the floor!
On the fucking floor!

38:06.520 --> 38:07.840
-Come in.
-Have we got him?

38:07.920 --> 38:09.000
From Ops, radio check.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.040
<i>Foxtrot, Bravo here.</i>
<i>One IC, one female safe.</i>

38:12.120 --> 38:16.000
<i>One IC, one female in and out</i>
<i>of consciousness. Ambulance called.</i>

38:16.680 --> 38:17.880
IC, one male?

38:17.960 --> 38:19.880
<i>Negative. Went out of the building.</i>

38:19.960 --> 38:21.000
Shit!

38:21.080 --> 38:23.160
<i>You let that go on too long.</i>

38:24.560 --> 38:26.560
-Well, is she gonna live?
<i>-Yes.</i>

38:26.640 --> 38:28.000
So, deal with your own shit.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.320
What the...

38:37.240 --> 38:40.200
Marcus, find out which hospital
they take Poulsen to.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.080
Tell 'em we need regular updates.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.160
This is bullshit!

38:44.560 --> 38:46.160
Where's she even gone?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.440
Her dad's.

39:09.040 --> 39:10.360
Ooh, that smells good.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.760
What'll you have?

39:18.080 --> 39:18.960
That's fine.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.160
Le Rouge?

39:23.480 --> 39:24.880
Tiger tears tonight.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.520
Thought we'd try something oriental.
How does that sound?

39:28.600 --> 39:29.960
Sounds lovely.

39:31.080 --> 39:32.160
Glad you could make it.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.960
Close shave with the VX assassins
is what I'm hearing.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.440
Are we gonna talk about anything
other than work tonight?

39:40.080 --> 39:41.960
Of course. First rule...

39:42.040 --> 39:43.200
Don't bring it home.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.640
"Don't bring it home." Exactly.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.040
So, Glen discovered the Czech special
police had some success with...

39:51.720 --> 39:52.960
hyoscine.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.280
And he brought it tome, actually,

39:55.360 --> 39:58.000
and we thought, well, why not?

39:58.080 --> 39:59.600
Hyoscine?

39:59.680 --> 40:01.640
Hyoscine, scopolamine.
It's the same thing.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.480
This is the summer of 1979,
Warrenpoint, 18 paras blown to bits,

40:05.560 --> 40:07.240
Mountbatten murdered,
feelings running high.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.880
We had this IRA quartermaster,
tied up at a barn.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.880
Tough bugger,
die for the cause type.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.520
Three days we had him in there.
Three days. Not a dickie bird.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.360
One dose of hyoscine,
can't get the bugger to shut up.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.960
Set the bloody Provos back years.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.240
Tell me about this Danish girl.

40:26.440 --> 40:27.320
Katrine.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.680
Secret Service?

40:32.520 --> 40:36.080
And she's connected
to this fellow that killed Glen?

40:38.080 --> 40:39.480
He almost beat her to death.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.200
Is that a connection?

40:42.880 --> 40:44.320
But you think
it might have been a play?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.200
Which hospital is she in?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.960
Royal Draycot.

40:52.040 --> 40:55.280
I'll call Dr. Hassan.
See how she reacts to hyoscine.

40:56.480 --> 40:58.520
She'll probably react by dying!

40:58.600 --> 40:59.480
Nonsense.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.760
You know, the side effects
are seizures and heart attacks.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.520
Small price, Beatrice.

41:07.920 --> 41:09.000
I'm not doing it.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.440
If this terror attack Kutiev
warned us about goes ahead,

41:13.520 --> 41:15.080
you'll wish to God you had.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.320
Brace yourself.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.560
-Can it wait till tomorrow?
-Could do.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.720
Well, obviously,
I've got to know now.

41:40.800 --> 41:44.080
A poll taken
after the referendum announcement

41:44.160 --> 41:47.600
shows a surge
in support for independence.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.920
How much?

41:50.480 --> 41:53.080
Up from 42 to 49.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.280
They need 55. We're still ahead.

41:56.360 --> 41:57.840
Well, it could backfire.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.680
The unfairness
of the 55 percent ruling

42:00.760 --> 42:04.600
is the main reason people gave
for changing their minds.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.480
Well, I haven't started
my campaign yet.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.320
Torben?

42:43.560 --> 42:46.200
Our number one priority
is to find this guy.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.120
A man capable of causing carnage
with chemical weapons.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.480
It's my opinion
that rather than risking the union,

42:51.560 --> 42:53.040
you should cancel the referendum.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.720
Torben?

42:55.360 --> 42:57.200
She doesn't leave this room.

42:57.280 --> 42:59.400
We both know
that you can't arrest me.

42:59.480 --> 43:02.160
If you wanna help the case,
just stay here.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.200
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.800
-Holly wants to see me.
-Oh, shit.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.000
This has to be off-off books.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.600
-What are you doing?
-On your knees! Drop onto your hands!

43:12.680 --> 43:14.120
Get on the floor! Do it now!

43:14.200 --> 43:16.760
Everybody said
I'd never make it to this level.

43:16.840 --> 43:20.160
So, get on board
or put in for a transfer.

43:20.240 --> 43:21.800
-Hi.
<i>-Hi.</i>

43:22.640 --> 43:24.680
We have a critical terrorist threat.

43:24.760 --> 43:27.320
The fate of the union
is in our hands.

43:27.400 --> 43:30.760
I don't care whether you trust me
or not 'cause I know the truth.

43:30.840 --> 43:35.040
How about I inject you with this
and then we find out for sure?

43:38.040 --> 43:41.040
