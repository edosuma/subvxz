00:04.819 --> 00:06.085
What are you watching?

00:06.110 --> 00:09.664
Uh, Carol and Dr. Lewis trying
to say goodbye to each other.

00:09.689 --> 00:11.558
They've been at it for 20 minutes.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.046
I love watching old people flirt.

00:15.970 --> 00:18.101
It was nice having coffee with you.

00:18.126 --> 00:19.750
No, it was nice having coffee with you.

00:19.775 --> 00:20.775
Oh.

00:21.306 --> 00:24.054
All right. Hey. Have a great surgery.

00:24.079 --> 00:25.656
Go save some lives today.

00:25.681 --> 00:27.890
No. You save some lives today.

00:28.857 --> 00:31.297
You know, you really shouldn't
hold the elevator in a hospital.

00:31.321 --> 00:32.387
Oh, Frost.

00:32.412 --> 00:34.335
- Glad you're here.
- That backfired.

00:35.221 --> 00:38.281
You still haven't RSVP'd
to tomorrow's fundraiser.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.640
- Oh.
- Ooh, a fundraiser?

00:39.665 --> 00:42.126
Uh, the hospital's building a new
cardiothoracic surgery center.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.859
Oh, it's just your basic cocktail party.

00:43.884 --> 00:45.960
You know the kind. Passed apps...

00:45.985 --> 00:47.242
Passed apps?

00:47.267 --> 00:49.147
Well, then you're gonna
love the silent auction.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.390
If you tell me there's
a chocolate fountain

00:51.415 --> 00:53.039
at this event, I'm gonna lose my mind.

00:54.089 --> 00:56.000
Uh, would you like to come?

00:56.025 --> 00:57.250
Yes.

00:57.275 --> 00:59.164
Great. I'll see you later.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.437
Not if I see you first.

01:00.820 --> 01:01.820
Goodbye.

01:01.845 --> 01:03.921
- You can just say goodbye.
- Okay.

01:06.170 --> 01:08.382
Great. Another cocktail party

01:08.407 --> 01:10.296
where the apps are served room temp,

01:10.321 --> 01:12.585
so the surgeons don't burn
their precious little hands.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.898
Well, I wish I could
join in with a colorful jab,

01:14.923 --> 01:18.593
but nurses don't get invited
to these hospital fundraisers.

01:18.618 --> 01:22.156
Oh. I have a plus-one.
Do you want to go?

01:22.342 --> 01:25.537
Oh, I'm so caught off guard.

01:26.634 --> 01:27.890
Yeah, pick me up at 6:00.

01:27.915 --> 01:29.685
And don't try to be a
hero and show up early.

01:29.710 --> 01:31.164
You'll just be waiting till 6:00.

01:41.411 --> 01:43.640
Good morning. I need
help picking a dress.

01:43.665 --> 01:44.921
Where's Daniel?

01:45.595 --> 01:48.601
I'm going to the fundraiser
tonight with Dr. Lewis.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.960
- Ooh.
- Dang. Whoa, Carol,

01:50.985 --> 01:52.390
he asked you to hospital prom.

01:52.415 --> 01:53.679
- That's major.
- Mm-hmm.

01:53.704 --> 01:55.249
But at this prom, I won't have to drive

01:55.273 --> 01:56.642
the drunk kids home early.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.726
I skipped my prom in protest.

01:59.751 --> 02:01.696
- Against what?
- Not being asked.

02:01.875 --> 02:02.875
Yep.

02:03.209 --> 02:06.218
So, you and Dr. Lewis
are moving pretty fast.

02:06.243 --> 02:07.444
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

02:07.469 --> 02:08.491
We've had a few dates.

02:08.517 --> 02:10.353
Seven. You've been on seven dates.

02:11.322 --> 02:12.523
That can't be right.

02:12.548 --> 02:14.632
No, it is. In the past
two weeks, you've had

02:14.657 --> 02:17.656
four coffees, two lunches,
and a trip to the botanical garden.

02:17.975 --> 02:19.554
You're tracking my dates?

02:19.579 --> 02:21.882
Absolutely.
That's how you determine a trend.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.914
And you guys are trending.

02:24.939 --> 02:27.975
You are gonna have a
couple's nickname very soon.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.632
A nickname? No-no-no-no.

02:29.657 --> 02:32.476
People are finally starting to
call me Dr. Kenney instead of

02:32.501 --> 02:33.945
"that old intern."

02:34.342 --> 02:36.516
Well, then, weird choice to
go to the fundraiser with him.

02:36.540 --> 02:39.843
It's basically telling the whole
hospital you two are serious.

02:39.868 --> 02:42.601
It is? I-I mean, I really like him,

02:42.626 --> 02:44.281
but I don't want to
get serious too soon.

02:44.306 --> 02:46.578
This is my first relationship
since my divorce.

02:46.602 --> 02:47.645
Well, maybe think about that

02:47.669 --> 02:49.772
before introducing him
to your daughter tonight?

02:49.797 --> 02:51.399
Oh, no, Jenny's not coming.

02:52.304 --> 02:54.375
Jenny invited me to hospital prom.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.812
I need help picking my outfit.
Where's Dennis?

03:00.798 --> 03:03.140
Uh, guys? I-I just
dropped off a patient.

03:03.165 --> 03:05.414
I know she doesn't really belong here,

03:05.439 --> 03:08.286
- but I had to get her out of the ER.
- What's wrong with her?

03:08.311 --> 03:10.648
She'll be happy to tell you.
She's very...

03:11.016 --> 03:12.281
vocal.

03:13.078 --> 03:15.156
I owe you one, bye!

03:19.959 --> 03:20.959
Oh!

03:20.984 --> 03:23.742
The curling iron won't come out!
You have to help me!

03:23.767 --> 03:24.798
Oh, boy.

03:24.823 --> 03:27.059
I've tried everything, but it's stuck!

03:30.054 --> 03:32.582
Ma'am, I can see you're distraught,

03:32.607 --> 03:34.909
but I'm not sure what
we can do to help you.

03:34.941 --> 03:36.644
Have you considered cutting your hair?

03:36.669 --> 03:38.371
I can't cut my hair.

03:38.396 --> 03:40.021
My wedding is tomorrow.

03:40.046 --> 03:42.242
Oh, congratulations!

03:42.267 --> 03:44.429
This is a nightmare!

03:45.820 --> 03:46.987
I understand.

03:47.012 --> 03:48.981
Uh, it must be very upsetting.

03:49.006 --> 03:51.542
Is there someone we can call for you?

03:51.567 --> 03:53.256
No one can see me like this.

03:53.281 --> 03:54.873
That's why I'm here.

03:54.898 --> 03:57.299
Please, please, please help me.

03:57.332 --> 04:00.435
Just one second while I
consult with Dr. Gilani.

04:01.421 --> 04:02.971
We need to help this woman.

04:03.004 --> 04:04.905
We became doctors to help people.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.998
Yes, this isn't technically
a medical issue.

04:07.023 --> 04:08.684
The word you're
looking for is "remotely."

04:08.709 --> 04:11.367
This isn't remotely a medical issue.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.783
Lexi, Eddie's death really shook me.

04:14.823 --> 04:16.108
I need a win.

04:16.134 --> 04:18.685
And there's a very low
chance that we kill her.

04:19.583 --> 04:22.023
Uh, I can hear you.

04:25.589 --> 04:28.496
I've been feeling off
since Eddie died, too.

04:28.521 --> 04:30.895
Either that, or I need a new mattress.

04:31.431 --> 04:34.387
Well, look. Thanks to the
heteronormative patriarchy,

04:34.412 --> 04:36.778
this is the most
important day of her life,

04:36.803 --> 04:38.606
and we have a chance to save it.

04:39.574 --> 04:42.267
I'm in. Let's help this silly lady

04:42.292 --> 04:43.785
achieve her stupid dream.

04:44.678 --> 04:47.381
Now... did you try this?

04:47.762 --> 04:49.345
- Mmm.
- Ow!

04:56.990 --> 04:58.118
Hi, Jenny.

04:58.143 --> 04:59.642
Hi, Jenny's plus one.

05:00.853 --> 05:02.564
How great is tonight?

05:02.589 --> 05:03.973
Senior docs everywhere.

05:03.998 --> 05:05.212
One conversation and, boom,

05:05.237 --> 05:07.240
I get the fellowship of my dreams.

05:08.796 --> 05:11.673
This... is what medicine is all about.

05:12.740 --> 05:14.095
Networking.

05:14.684 --> 05:16.306
- You find this attractive?
- Mmm.

05:16.331 --> 05:17.579
Hey, where's Dr. Lewis?

05:17.619 --> 05:19.486
- Oh, I told him I'd meet him here.
- Why?

05:19.511 --> 05:21.494
You know, it was pointed out to me

05:21.519 --> 05:24.682
that things are moving a little
more quickly than I realized,

05:24.707 --> 05:26.346
and I don't want to rush into anything,

05:26.371 --> 05:30.611
so I'm just slowing things down,
playing it cool.

05:31.455 --> 05:34.900
Holy moly, you look handsome.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.671
- Real cool, Mom.
- Yeah.

05:37.885 --> 05:39.080
You look beautiful.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.705
Thank you.

05:46.034 --> 05:47.322
Are you gonna introduce us?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.158
Yes. Of course. Um,

05:49.183 --> 05:51.283
uh, Dr. Lewis,
this is my daughter Jenny.

05:51.308 --> 05:53.057
Jenny, this is Dr. Lewis, my colleague

05:53.082 --> 05:56.283
and... pal, my work pal.

05:57.307 --> 05:58.939
And I'm Dr. Daniel Kutcher.

05:58.964 --> 05:59.979
Duke Medical School.

06:00.004 --> 06:03.300
My interests include hepatology,
hiatal hernias, and squash.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.527
What a coincidence.

06:05.552 --> 06:08.011
That's my bio on the hospital website.

06:09.087 --> 06:10.769
Daniel, could you go
get me another drink?

06:10.794 --> 06:12.371
- You have one.
- Dr. Lewis,

06:12.396 --> 06:15.129
It is so nice to meet you.

06:15.154 --> 06:17.023
I heard you two went
to a botanical garden.

06:17.048 --> 06:19.051
Yes, we did. It was beautiful.

06:19.076 --> 06:22.557
Yes, but it was winter, so,
you know, lot of decay.

06:23.043 --> 06:24.269
Good point.

06:24.294 --> 06:26.339
We'll have to go back
again in the spring.

06:27.655 --> 06:31.566
Uh, spring? Mmm. March is pretty brisk.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.259
And then there's those April showers,

06:33.284 --> 06:36.769
which, yes,
bring flowers but also... bees.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.186
Oh, and-and-and
Jenny's allergic to them.

06:40.211 --> 06:41.879
I don't have to go.

06:44.402 --> 06:46.010
I-I guess it's for the best.

06:46.035 --> 06:48.089
The hibiscuses don't
even bloom until summer.

06:48.114 --> 06:49.778
Oh, I love a hibiscus.

06:49.803 --> 06:51.527
Those perennials are cold-hardy,

06:51.552 --> 06:53.655
but, boy, do they put on a show in June.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.879
June it is, then.

06:54.904 --> 06:56.651
I'll put it in my calendar.

06:56.808 --> 06:58.894
Oh, I need to go say hi to Dr. Castillo.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.160
Give him my best.

07:00.185 --> 07:01.871
I will tell her that.

07:03.816 --> 07:06.160
Wow. Way to play it cool, Mom.

07:06.185 --> 07:08.738
Yeah, nothing says "slowing things down"

07:08.763 --> 07:10.599
like making plans for next June.

07:11.694 --> 07:12.964
That was awful.

07:12.989 --> 07:16.660
And I lied. Even in winter,
the botanical garden is spectacular.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.587
This olive oil isn't working.

07:22.612 --> 07:25.082
Hear me out... canola.

07:26.416 --> 07:29.120
Do you have any non-oil-based solutions?

07:29.145 --> 07:31.192
Have you seen Dr. Sommers
and Dr. Gilani?

07:31.216 --> 07:33.380
It's Dr. Jacobs. She can't know
what's going on in here.

07:33.404 --> 07:34.668
Shh!

07:35.769 --> 07:37.194
Dr. Jacobs.

07:37.218 --> 07:39.152
There you two are.

07:39.324 --> 07:41.030
Why does it smell like...

07:41.355 --> 07:42.769
olive oil?

07:43.285 --> 07:44.285
Oh.

07:44.310 --> 07:47.886
Well, it is the perfect
self-contained snack on the go,

07:47.911 --> 07:49.413
you know, glug-glug-glug.

07:50.519 --> 07:53.839
So, it's not for a salad, it's to drink?

07:53.864 --> 07:55.136
- Mm-hmm.
- As a snack?

07:55.161 --> 07:56.558
- Mm-hmm.
- On the go?

07:56.583 --> 07:57.583
Yeah.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.308
Vegans be crazy, am I right?

08:03.224 --> 08:06.918
This is truly your worst attempt
at hiding high jinks from me.

08:10.825 --> 08:13.894
Okay. So she has a
curling iron stuck in her hair,

08:13.919 --> 08:15.788
and it is the day before her wedding.

08:15.813 --> 08:17.815
Dr. Jacobs,
I know that you won't approve...

08:17.840 --> 08:18.942
Enough.

08:18.967 --> 08:20.469
You've had this woman just sitting

08:20.494 --> 08:23.925
in a patient room with a
curling iron in her hair?

08:24.308 --> 08:28.160
But in our defense,
it was all Caleb's idea.

08:28.686 --> 08:30.800
Well, then, Dr. Sommers,

08:30.825 --> 08:33.695
to you I say... well done.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.034
Wait. You're not mad?

08:36.059 --> 08:39.972
No. I'm happy that at least
one of you had the humanity

08:39.996 --> 08:42.394
not to throw this poor
woman out on the street.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.613
I lied. It was my idea.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.632
I understand how you feel.

08:47.812 --> 08:50.925
You'll have these wedding photos
for the rest of your life.

08:50.950 --> 08:52.734
- Thank you.
- Now.

08:52.941 --> 08:54.379
Have you tried this?

08:54.404 --> 08:55.639
Ow!

08:58.567 --> 09:00.285
Look at all these surgeons.

09:00.310 --> 09:02.441
Patting themselves on the back.

09:02.466 --> 09:03.560
And for what?

09:03.585 --> 09:06.974
Replacing one organ with
the exact same organ?

09:09.366 --> 09:12.560
Uh-uh-uh. Don't fill
up on the spring rolls.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.067
Rookie move.

09:14.092 --> 09:15.825
The sashimi comes out in 20.

09:16.324 --> 09:17.935
I'm sorry, I thought you'd said

09:17.960 --> 09:19.802
you'd never been to
a hospital fundraiser.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.356
No, I've never been invited.

09:21.381 --> 09:24.060
I have, however,
been a plus one to all of them.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.754
Hmm.

09:30.032 --> 09:31.411
Excuse me.

09:31.436 --> 09:34.255
We couldn't help but notice
that you're here with Dr. Lewis.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.649
Yes. I'm Carol.

09:35.674 --> 09:36.980
I don't mean to seem forward, but...

09:37.004 --> 09:38.675
do you like books about murder?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.746
Of course. I'm a woman.

09:43.535 --> 09:45.954
Then you have to join our book club.

09:45.979 --> 09:47.347
We meet once a month.

09:47.372 --> 09:50.730
And we're all second wives of doctors,
so you'll fit right in.

09:50.755 --> 09:52.057
Oh, no, no.

09:52.082 --> 09:53.350
No-no-no-no.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.222
Dr. Lewis and I just started dating.

09:55.247 --> 09:57.613
It-It-It's casual. It's very casual.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.722
We are not even thinking about marriage.

10:01.189 --> 10:04.613
Well, you might not be,
but I'm sure Dr. Lewis is.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.183
Why do you say that?

10:06.208 --> 10:07.910
You know, men of a certain age,

10:07.935 --> 10:10.137
for the first six months
after the divorce,

10:10.162 --> 10:11.792
he's in bachelor heaven.

10:11.817 --> 10:14.675
Then he realizes he needs
a woman in the house.

10:14.700 --> 10:17.637
Or he'll die alone eating
roast beef in the tub.

10:19.408 --> 10:22.857
That's true.
Single men actually die earlier.

10:22.882 --> 10:26.453
And 60 Minutes did a thing on it,
so they know that now.

10:27.787 --> 10:29.826
I am married to Dr. Reyes.

10:29.851 --> 10:33.216
We got engaged six months
after we started dating.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.208
My husband proposed after one.

10:35.233 --> 10:36.301
One month?

10:36.326 --> 10:39.654
Yep. Took me to Mexico,
got down on one knee,

10:39.679 --> 10:41.576
and the rest is history.

10:41.601 --> 10:44.605
I was so surprised, I hadn't even waxed.

10:46.501 --> 10:48.270
What a beautiful story.

10:49.736 --> 10:54.162
But Dr. Lewis and I are not
in that place, not even close.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.779
I'm actually also a doctor myself.

10:56.804 --> 10:59.997
Oh, that's cute. I do needlepoint.

11:01.539 --> 11:04.138
Carol, I have a question for you:
what do you think of Cabo?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.060
Classy or trashy?

11:06.085 --> 11:07.747
Classy. It seems very nice.

11:07.772 --> 11:10.307
Great. They're auctioning
off a trip for two

11:10.332 --> 11:12.279
to a beach house in Cabo next month.

11:12.304 --> 11:13.707
I'm gonna go for it.

11:15.982 --> 11:19.486
Oh, no. Cabo's in Mexico.

11:20.771 --> 11:22.740
I'd get a wax if I were you.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.677
Why'd you pull me away in
the middle of my story?

11:29.702 --> 11:32.794
Okay, reciting
your résumé is not a story.

11:34.302 --> 11:36.685
Dr. Lewis wants to take me to Cabo.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.552
- San Lucas?
- Yeah.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.735
Wow, Mom, that's serious.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.540
Are we sure? Is Cabo
exclusively a romantic destination?

11:45.565 --> 11:47.244
Jenny, didn't you go
there in high school

11:47.268 --> 11:49.407
and build homes for the underprivileged?

11:50.150 --> 11:51.713
Yes.

11:52.825 --> 11:55.266
I went there to build homes.

11:55.291 --> 11:57.477
Well, casas.

11:58.505 --> 12:01.530
But I do think it's mostly
a romantic destination.

12:01.555 --> 12:02.610
Ugh.

12:02.635 --> 12:05.111
This is exactly what I've
been trying to avoid.

12:05.136 --> 12:06.977
I got stuck talking to the second wives,

12:07.002 --> 12:11.641
and I'm not a second wife.
I'm an ex-wife and a doctor.

12:11.666 --> 12:14.141
They were looking at me
like somebody's plus one.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.954
I'm not trying to get a ring.

12:15.979 --> 12:19.102
I was half of a married
couple for 30 years.

12:19.127 --> 12:21.493
I've worked so hard to be my own person.

12:21.518 --> 12:24.954
I am Dr. Kenney, not Dr. Mrs. Dr. Lewis.

12:24.979 --> 12:26.681
What if I don't want to go to Cabo?

12:26.706 --> 12:28.095
- San Lucas?
- Yeah.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.289
You both have to cool it.

12:30.946 --> 12:33.806
I got to put a stop to this.
I can't go on that trip.

12:33.831 --> 12:35.524
I am gonna talk to him and tell him

12:35.549 --> 12:37.351
that things are moving too fast.

12:37.376 --> 12:38.861
At his event?

12:38.886 --> 12:41.157
In front of all his
friends and colleagues?

12:41.892 --> 12:43.126
You're right.

12:43.150 --> 12:45.016
That would be inappropriate.

12:45.907 --> 12:48.431
I'm gonna trick someone
into outbidding him.

12:51.726 --> 12:54.446
I hear the beach house
in Cabo is fantastic.

12:54.471 --> 12:56.282
Jennifer Aniston stays there.

12:56.307 --> 12:58.993
She left some clothes,
and you can wear them.

13:00.639 --> 13:04.673
It has an infinity pool and,
get this, towels,

13:04.698 --> 13:06.056
the big ones.

13:07.806 --> 13:10.540
Hey Dr. Frost,
scoping out the silent auction?

13:10.565 --> 13:13.407
Lot of good stuff, lot of good stuff.

13:14.643 --> 13:18.198
Oh, the Cabo beach house
looks wonderful.

13:18.223 --> 13:20.198
Oh, not for me.

13:20.493 --> 13:21.839
I hate sand.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.967
Fair enough.
Looks like Victor's gonna win it.

13:24.992 --> 13:27.631
Hmm? Lewis is bidding on the house?

13:27.656 --> 13:29.889
Oh, yeah. He can't
stop talking about it.

13:29.914 --> 13:33.217
You know those scalpel jockeys,
they love to win.

13:34.536 --> 13:36.311
Plus, he has surgeon money.

13:36.336 --> 13:39.568
Well, I have an internist's
spirit for besting surgeons.

13:39.593 --> 13:41.139
And family money.

13:41.164 --> 13:43.107
Plus, I'm a little drunk.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.303
I've never been to Cabo.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.930
Is $70,000 too much to bid?

13:53.568 --> 13:54.568
Comb.

13:54.593 --> 13:56.327
Comb.

13:58.792 --> 13:59.820
Other comb.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.123
Other comb.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.193
Damn it, she's flatlining.

14:04.554 --> 14:05.582
What?

14:05.607 --> 14:06.657
No, uh, sorry.

14:06.682 --> 14:08.413
It's just that your hair's
starting to look really flat.

14:08.437 --> 14:10.865
- It's over. We need to call it.
- No.

14:10.890 --> 14:14.482
There is a combined 24 years of
advanced schooling in this room.

14:14.507 --> 14:15.857
We can figure this out.

14:15.882 --> 14:18.006
I'm a lawyer,
so that's 31 if you add my seven.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.499
This isn't about you, Stephanie.

14:19.666 --> 14:22.631
It's no use. We've tried everything.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.357
This just isn't our specialty.

14:25.349 --> 14:26.669
Well, then

14:26.694 --> 14:28.639
we need to call a specialist.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.475
Smug bastard.

14:36.402 --> 14:37.903
Let's see him beat this.

14:39.910 --> 14:42.389
Dr. Frost, what happened to hating sand?

14:42.414 --> 14:46.068
Ah, well, sure,
but a rivalry is a rivalry.

14:47.557 --> 14:49.670
Plus, Dr. Kenney made an excellent point

14:49.695 --> 14:50.896
about the towels.

14:50.921 --> 14:54.658
Sure. It all comes back
to Carol, doesn't it?

14:54.982 --> 14:56.540
What is that supposed to mean?

14:57.002 --> 14:59.478
Oh, this rivalry with Dr. Lewis.

14:59.503 --> 15:01.604
Is it just about surgeons,
or are you maybe

15:01.629 --> 15:04.470
a little bit jealous of him and Carol?

15:04.495 --> 15:06.236
- Oh, no, Dennis.
- Hmm?

15:06.261 --> 15:08.954
That's... No. That's just silliness,
utter silliness.

15:08.979 --> 15:11.515
I daresay you've had too
much of the champagne.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.712
Oh, it's a charity event.
It'd be rude not to drink all I can.

15:15.618 --> 15:18.462
Dr. Kenney is an esteemed colleague.

15:18.487 --> 15:22.814
Sure, she's quite smart,
a talented doctor,

15:22.839 --> 15:24.853
and, if pressed,

15:24.878 --> 15:26.829
I'd say she's attractive.

15:27.569 --> 15:30.040
She's very symmetrical.

15:31.879 --> 15:33.783
And to say she isn't is just...

15:33.808 --> 15:35.134
Utter silliness?

15:35.159 --> 15:36.212
Exactly.

15:37.014 --> 15:39.040
See, the nice thing
about stepchildren is,

15:39.065 --> 15:40.564
if you don't pay attention to them,

15:40.589 --> 15:42.158
they don't pay attention to you.

15:43.322 --> 15:45.876
I'm glad you found the silver lining.

15:47.216 --> 15:49.517
Frost is really gunning
for that beach house.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.855
- Oh.
- I had to raise my bid three times.

15:51.880 --> 15:54.616
He must be a big Jennifer Aniston fan.

15:54.641 --> 15:56.174
What does that have to do with anything?

15:56.198 --> 15:59.368
Well, you know, the Cabo beach house,
it's frequented by celebrities.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.540
No, it isn't. That's our beach house.

16:01.565 --> 16:03.486
No one famous has ever stayed there.

16:03.511 --> 16:05.514
Tina, why do you lie?

16:06.720 --> 16:07.892
I'm not lying.

16:07.917 --> 16:10.509
You're the one that said
Jennifer Aniston stays there,

16:10.534 --> 16:11.993
the sand is so fine,

16:12.018 --> 16:14.154
and there's a Target
within walking distance.

16:14.504 --> 16:16.298
None of that is true.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.439
Carol,

16:17.464 --> 16:19.901
are you trying to get other
people to bid on the Cabo trip?

16:19.926 --> 16:21.384
I was trying to win that.

16:21.409 --> 16:22.470
- Listen...
- Ha!

16:22.495 --> 16:24.689
The silent auction is closed.

16:24.714 --> 16:27.984
I got the house in Cabo for two weeks,

16:28.009 --> 16:29.845
holiday weekends not included.

16:29.870 --> 16:32.978
In your face, Lewis.

16:34.092 --> 16:36.993
Dr. Frost, let's get
you some water, huh?

16:38.897 --> 16:41.806
He's taking the curling
iron apart. Brilliant.

16:41.831 --> 16:44.118
It's literally the first
thing I thought of.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.690
Would've been quicker
without all that olive oil.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.966
Stephanie,

16:52.991 --> 16:54.896
I wish you a lifetime of happiness.

16:54.921 --> 16:57.557
Remember, don't just love each other,

16:57.582 --> 16:59.146
talk to each other.

17:00.927 --> 17:03.466
All right, I got to fix a toilet on 13.

17:06.127 --> 17:08.076
Thank you, guys, so much.

17:08.101 --> 17:11.021
Now I can actually show my
face at our rehearsal dinner.

17:13.019 --> 17:14.319
What?

17:14.345 --> 17:16.201
Stephanie, you have to understand,

17:16.226 --> 17:19.443
there's a recovery period
to every procedure.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.848
Don't worry.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.599
I know another specialist.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.107
Why am I just now hearing about this?

17:34.712 --> 17:36.833
Stand back. I need space to work.

17:41.941 --> 17:43.771
Can I explain?

17:44.769 --> 17:48.495
Please. You've been acting
strange all night.

17:49.412 --> 17:53.449
I have been having so much fun with you.

17:53.474 --> 17:56.269
I started worrying that
we were moving too fast.

17:56.294 --> 17:58.497
We've had seven dates in ten days,

17:58.522 --> 18:00.292
we're barreling towards a nickname,

18:00.317 --> 18:03.495
then you started talking
about Cabo, San Lucas,

18:03.520 --> 18:04.831
and naturally I started worrying

18:04.856 --> 18:05.981
that you were gonna propose to me,

18:06.005 --> 18:08.824
and I am not ready to join
another murder book club.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.941
Carol, I don't know how
murder factors into this,

18:13.742 --> 18:16.113
but I was bidding on the Cabo trip

18:16.138 --> 18:17.894
as a gift for my sister and her husband.

18:17.919 --> 18:19.588
Their 30th is next month.

18:19.989 --> 18:21.277
- Oh.
- Mm.

18:21.550 --> 18:24.720
Well, congrats to them.
30 is a real milestone.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.449
I also don't want to move too quickly.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.042
Honestly, I thought maybe
I wasn't moving

18:30.067 --> 18:31.745
fast enough for you.

18:31.770 --> 18:33.597
What would make you think that?

18:33.622 --> 18:35.464
Well, the lunches.

18:35.765 --> 18:37.675
The botanical gardens.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.019
Don't get me wrong, I loved those dates,

18:40.366 --> 18:43.511
but they were all at your invitation.

18:44.409 --> 18:45.574
Huh.

18:45.852 --> 18:49.622
Well, yeah, I guess,
technically, that's true.

18:49.647 --> 18:52.058
And then, when the fundraiser came up,

18:52.083 --> 18:54.519
it felt like you were
angling for an invitation.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.378
You were so excited
about the silent auction,

18:56.403 --> 18:57.949
I didn't want to disappoint you.

18:57.974 --> 19:00.542
No, that is just my natural enthusiasm.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.160
You tell me there's a
party with passed apps,

19:02.184 --> 19:04.605
I'm gonna have a hard time
containing my excitement.

19:06.302 --> 19:08.081
One of the most
charming things about you

19:08.106 --> 19:10.925
is your inability to contain
basic human emotions.

19:12.666 --> 19:14.702
So, actually,

19:14.727 --> 19:17.663
it sounds like maybe
we're on the same page?

19:17.688 --> 19:19.175
Uh, it depends.

19:19.639 --> 19:21.042
Would it be too forward to ask you

19:21.067 --> 19:23.495
to try a new gelato place this weekend?

19:23.777 --> 19:26.013
Okay, now you're smothering me.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.972
I would love to.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.245
I don't want to go to Cabo,

19:38.761 --> 19:41.664
and I could've spent the
money on something else,

19:41.689 --> 19:44.550
but I bested him,
that's what's important.

19:44.876 --> 19:46.165
You know,

19:46.190 --> 19:49.196
nurses almost never get to go to Cabo.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.635
Dennis, that's not working on me again.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.041
"Not working."

19:54.066 --> 19:55.932
I wish I knew something about that.

19:55.957 --> 19:59.112
Nurses are almost always working.

20:02.778 --> 20:06.616
Ah, Dennis, pack your beach boots.

20:06.641 --> 20:08.424
You're going to Cabo.

20:15.403 --> 20:16.651
That's incredible.

20:16.676 --> 20:18.073
Where did you find baby's breath?

20:18.098 --> 20:20.948
Oh, that was me.
I stole it from the next room.

20:22.072 --> 20:23.674
She was sleeping.

20:23.949 --> 20:25.518
I'm pretty sure she was sleeping.

20:26.545 --> 20:30.940
You are a lifesaver. Thank you so much.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.571
Thank you all.

20:32.596 --> 20:34.620
I'd ask you to my wedding, but...

20:34.645 --> 20:36.338
I just gave my last invite away.

20:36.643 --> 20:40.382
See you tomorrow,
and there will be crying.

20:43.564 --> 20:45.097
- All right, Lexie, your turn.
- That wasn't a request.

20:45.121 --> 20:47.329
I don't need my hair done.
