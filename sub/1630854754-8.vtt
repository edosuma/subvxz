00:23.723 --> 00:25.592
Aura Mayari...

00:25.692 --> 00:29.462
Is it true that Big Daddy
died on top of you?

00:29.562 --> 00:31.498
You didn't pop for me.

00:31.598 --> 00:33.566
- Jax.
- Party.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.402
You had no point of view.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.670
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.473
And I'd love
to write back again.

00:40.573 --> 00:43.610
Here's your one chance,
and you did not let us down.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.811
Condragulations,
you're the winner

00:44.911 --> 00:47.280
of this week's challenge.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.749
Jax, shantay, you stay.

00:49.849 --> 00:51.251
- [sighs]
- Aura,

00:51.351 --> 00:53.119
sashay away.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.488
My dead dad
will haunt you all.

00:55.588 --> 00:58.291
- Ah...
- Oh, my God.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.729
[dramatic music]

01:05.331 --> 01:06.933
[sighs]

01:07.033 --> 01:08.601
- Ooh.
- We're down to ten.

01:08.701 --> 01:10.804
I just sent Aura home,

01:10.904 --> 01:12.772
and she cursed us.
[chuckles]

01:12.872 --> 01:15.508
I am a little terrified,
because she did unleash

01:15.608 --> 01:18.411
the hex of her dead father
upon us all.

01:18.511 --> 01:20.847
Bob walked onto her
first runway purse first,

01:20.947 --> 01:24.250
and Aura left
that runway cursed first.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.485
That's my second lip sync.

01:25.585 --> 01:26.953
So I sent two home.

01:27.053 --> 01:30.323
Lip-synching for my life,
the second week in a row,

01:30.423 --> 01:33.159
I'm really thankful
that I showed the girls

01:33.259 --> 01:35.728
that it's gonna take
a lot to send me home,

01:35.829 --> 01:39.899
but also, I don't wanna be
in the bottom anymore.

01:39.999 --> 01:41.601
Congratulations, Mistress!

01:41.701 --> 01:43.169
[all cheering]

01:43.269 --> 01:45.939
Thank you.
You know, got a couple coins

01:46.039 --> 01:47.674
in my purse,
and I'm about to act brand-new.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.075
[laughter]

01:49.175 --> 01:51.377
I end up safe this week,

01:51.478 --> 01:53.847
which really burns
my marshmallow,

01:53.947 --> 01:54.848
to be honest with you.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.082
I'm fucking pissed.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.119
Okay.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.722
I'm very, very upset
that I was not in the top.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.625
I'm surprised

02:05.725 --> 02:08.394
and, um, annoyed.

02:08.495 --> 02:09.729
I think that I did
extremely well

02:09.829 --> 02:10.830
in this challenge,

02:10.930 --> 02:13.032
and I think that I carried

02:13.133 --> 02:15.268
a lot of the scenes
that I was in.

02:15.368 --> 02:17.871
Loosey, if you think
you're perfection,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.673
there might be a case
of drag delusion, girl.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.143
Well, girls, I have
an announcement to make.

02:23.243 --> 02:24.377
It's been giving safe spice,

02:24.477 --> 02:26.613
but I'm officially
entering my top era.

02:26.713 --> 02:29.816
I am going to trot
my way up to the top.

02:29.916 --> 02:31.351
Didn't they tell you
to stop doing that?

02:31.451 --> 02:33.486
Baby, they said
to stop doing that.

02:33.586 --> 02:34.554
The CDC should really look

02:34.654 --> 02:36.890
into making
a drag delusion vaccine,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.659
because I think that at
this point in the competition,

02:39.759 --> 02:41.928
the drag delusion
might be contagious.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.532
Loosey, call Ru up.
Tell her how you feel.

02:45.632 --> 02:49.369
I'm about to--
1-800-R-U-P-A-U-L.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.463
It's a new day
in the workroom,

03:17.564 --> 03:19.666
and I am happy to enter
my top era.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.434
I am being a full-on top.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.805
Like, Spice-dom-top era
entering right now.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.040
How's everybody feeling?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.308
Who is, like, so pissed

03:28.408 --> 03:29.709
that they haven't won
a challenge yet?

03:29.809 --> 03:32.145
Me!
I'm over it.

03:32.245 --> 03:33.680
Are you just as pissed
as Loosey was

03:33.780 --> 03:34.981
when she wasn't
in the top last week?

03:35.081 --> 03:36.849
- [laughter]
- Oh, girl, I love you.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.251
I know you're my sister,
but when you were

03:38.351 --> 03:40.687
on that couch, just
complaining about being safe,

03:40.787 --> 03:43.590
I was just like, "Shut up."
[laughter]

03:43.690 --> 03:45.925
I had one moment
of being a little upset,

03:46.025 --> 03:47.393
- and I don't understand why--
- No, I don't think you were

03:47.493 --> 03:49.062
a little upset.
You said--and I quote--

03:49.162 --> 03:50.630
"I am fucking angry."

03:50.730 --> 03:52.065
[laughter]

03:52.165 --> 03:54.867
I know for a fact that
that bitch was pissed.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.202
You have every right
to be mad,

03:56.302 --> 03:57.704
but, girl, own it.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.272
Feel how you feel, baby.
Let it out.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.709
Hello, hello, hello!

04:02.809 --> 04:05.111
[all scream]

04:05.211 --> 04:06.646
[laughs]

04:06.746 --> 04:08.414
You better work, bitch.

04:08.514 --> 04:11.951
Ladykids, we are
halfway through the season,

04:12.051 --> 04:16.155
and I still haven't seen some
of you lip-synch for your life.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.125
That is all about to change.

04:19.225 --> 04:21.294
For this week's Maxi Challenge,

04:21.394 --> 04:25.031
we're putting your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

04:25.131 --> 04:26.733
to the ultimate test

04:26.833 --> 04:28.134
in a good old-fashioned

04:28.234 --> 04:30.703
lip-sync LaLaPaRuZa.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.806
[all scream]

04:33.906 --> 04:36.409
LaLaPaRuZa is like--
you remember WWE,

04:36.509 --> 04:37.644
like a "SmackDown"?
It's that

04:37.744 --> 04:38.978
with lip-synching drag queens.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.614
We battling each other--
one goes down, one goes up.

04:41.714 --> 04:42.915
One goes down.
One goes up.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.652
Who's left?
Who got the belt?

04:45.752 --> 04:48.488
Get into lip-sync
assassin drag,

04:48.588 --> 04:51.557
and then, I'll meet you
out on the main stage.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.827
Remember ladies, tonight,
one of you

04:54.927 --> 04:56.829
will be going home.

04:58.197 --> 05:00.099
Racers, start your engines,

05:00.199 --> 05:03.403
and may
the best drag queen win.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.472
- All right, ladies.
- Oh, whoo!

05:06.572 --> 05:09.642
I feel like everyone
is equal part excited

05:09.742 --> 05:11.010
and ready to kill it,

05:11.110 --> 05:13.146
but also nervous and ready
to shit their pants.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.649
I'm gonna LaLa
that fucking PaRUza.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.219
I did not expect, when I came
in here this morning,

05:20.320 --> 05:21.954
for us to be LaLaPaRuZa-ing.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.756
Who else is ga-ga-ga-gag?

05:23.856 --> 05:25.858
I'm Gagisha'd, for sure.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.461
I'm just listening.
I'm taking notes of everybody.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.363
I see the gears turning
in everyone's head.

05:30.463 --> 05:34.567
Spice, Marcia, and Loosey
are the three targets, bitch.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.704
They are the bullseyes to be
safe in everybody's eyes.

05:37.804 --> 05:40.039
I would just give the tea.
It is what it is.

05:40.139 --> 05:42.141
And then the girls
people are scared of

05:42.241 --> 05:44.777
would definitely have to be
Sasha and Anetra.

05:44.877 --> 05:46.746
At the end of the day,
someone capped my ass,

05:46.846 --> 05:48.448
'cause y'all were
more sicker than I was.

05:48.548 --> 05:49.716
I can accept the fact.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.384
See, you're not
a complete bitch.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.053
Um, I'm in my congenial era.

Welcome to the main stage

06:23.716 --> 06:25.818
Tonight, it's just family

06:25.918 --> 06:28.921
for our lip-sync
LaLaPaRuZa smackdown.

06:29.021 --> 06:31.224
Racers, start your engines,

06:37.930 --> 06:39.866
The LaLaPaRuZa smackdown

06:39.966 --> 06:41.067
is about to commence,

06:41.167 --> 06:42.268
and we're ready
to battle it out

06:42.368 --> 06:44.203
in these lip syncs until
one of these other girls

06:44.303 --> 06:45.505
goes home--

06:45.605 --> 06:46.873
emphasis on "other."

06:46.973 --> 06:48.508
[mouths words]

06:50.343 --> 06:51.577
Welcome, queens.

06:51.677 --> 06:56.015
For tonight's lip-sync
LaLaPaRuZa smackdown,

06:56.115 --> 07:00.353
you will face off
in a series of eight lip syncs.

07:00.453 --> 07:01.888
If you win your lip sync,

07:01.988 --> 07:05.057
you'll be safe
from elimination.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.561
If you lose,
you'll continue to face off

07:08.661 --> 07:11.764
until two queens remain.

07:11.864 --> 07:15.935
In the end, one of you
will sashay away.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.372
It feels like Ancient Rome.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.673
- Yes!
- Yeah.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.208
This is our version
of the Colosseum.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.276
- Yeah.
- Gladiators.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.577
Gladiator!

07:24.677 --> 07:27.480
- [laughter]
- Oh, my gosh.

07:27.580 --> 07:29.382
- [exhales]
- Now,

07:29.482 --> 07:34.287
let the lip-sync
LaLaPaRuZa smackdown begin!

07:36.656 --> 07:38.891
Oh, pit crew...

07:41.027 --> 07:42.361
Ladies,

07:42.462 --> 07:45.064
in Bruno's golden hopper

07:45.164 --> 07:48.835
are ten balls
with your names on them.

07:48.935 --> 07:52.338
Now, to determine
the first queen to lip-synch,

07:52.438 --> 07:54.774
Bruno will randomly choose

07:54.874 --> 07:56.943
one ball.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.478
Bruno,

07:58.578 --> 08:00.246
hit it.

08:05.384 --> 08:09.355
Bruno, show us
whose ball you're holding.

08:09.455 --> 08:10.790
Malaysia.

08:13.226 --> 08:16.762
Now you get to choose
your opponent.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.334
I know everybody
would've wanna see

08:21.434 --> 08:24.103
a Malaysia vs. Mistress,

08:24.203 --> 08:25.738
but I know that Spice

08:25.838 --> 08:27.940
is probably one
of the weaker lip-synchers.

08:29.475 --> 08:31.110
[sighs]
I don't know.

08:31.210 --> 08:32.712
I don't know who I'ma choose.

[sighs]

08:37.817 --> 08:39.552
Malaysia,

08:39.652 --> 08:43.623
now you get to choose
your opponent.

08:43.723 --> 08:45.057
Girl, just say my name.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.993
Come on, it's the--
give the girls what they want--

08:47.093 --> 08:48.394
Malaysia vs. Mistress.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.730
Who do you choose?

08:53.833 --> 08:54.934
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.437
Like, bitch,

08:58.538 --> 09:00.139
wrong choice.

09:00.239 --> 09:02.074
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- Oh, my God.

09:02.174 --> 09:04.477
Marcia Marcia Marcia,

09:04.577 --> 09:06.646
you may choose the song.

09:06.746 --> 09:08.714
- Ooh...
- Will it be...

09:31.971 --> 09:33.839
Please,
I wanna do Celine Dion,

09:33.940 --> 09:36.075
"It's All Coming Back
to Me Now."

09:36.175 --> 09:38.678
"Boys Don't Cry" by Anitta.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.185
The rest of you may step
to the back of the stage.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.326
Two queens stand before me.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.496
The time has come

09:57.597 --> 09:59.932
for you to lip-synch

10:00.032 --> 10:01.167
for

10:01.267 --> 10:02.234
your

10:02.335 --> 10:03.669
life!

10:05.838 --> 10:07.940
Nobody here
has seen me lip-synch.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.610
Let's just say, um,
when I lip-synch,

10:10.710 --> 10:12.979
it's a flipping good time.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.648
Good luck,

10:15.748 --> 10:16.782
and don't

10:16.882 --> 10:18.884
fuck it up.

you when I can't sleep

10:28.995 --> 10:30.563
Alone

10:30.663 --> 10:33.165
In your feelings,
I can feel it

10:33.265 --> 10:34.667
You're in your feelings

10:34.767 --> 10:36.135
You won't admit it

10:36.235 --> 10:40.306
But that's why I push you
away from me

10:40.406 --> 10:42.608
'Cause I know, I know

10:42.708 --> 10:44.443
It drives you crazy

10:44.543 --> 10:45.745
Try to tame me

10:45.845 --> 10:49.582
But nobody's
taking control

10:49.682 --> 10:53.719
Over me

10:53.819 --> 10:55.021
Whoo, bitch!

10:55.121 --> 10:56.322
[singing] Baby,
you be talking tough

10:56.422 --> 10:58.824
Didn't see that coming,
did you, Malaysia?

10:58.924 --> 11:01.494
[singing] Enough
when the girls don't need

11:01.594 --> 11:03.663
This bitch be having me
do backflips and shit.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.731
Like, right now,
it's time to amp it up.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.534
Malaysia, get this leg up
in this air, baby!

11:08.634 --> 11:11.170
[singing] Ooh, baby, baby,
you be talking tough

11:11.270 --> 11:12.505
Ooh!

11:12.605 --> 11:14.807
[singing] Can't get enough
when the girls

11:14.907 --> 11:16.909
Yes, bitch!
Come on!

11:17.009 --> 11:20.146
[all screaming]

11:20.246 --> 11:21.313
[singing] Ooh, baby, baby

11:21.414 --> 11:22.748
Hey!

11:22.848 --> 11:25.518
[singing] 'Cause your boys
can't get enough

11:25.618 --> 11:27.586
Come on, Malaysia!

11:27.687 --> 11:29.288
- Okay, Malaysia.
- Come on, y'all.

11:29.388 --> 11:31.957
[singing] Who says boys
don't cry?

11:32.058 --> 11:35.094
- [screams]
- Yes!

11:35.194 --> 11:37.863
Oh, wow.
[laughter]

11:37.963 --> 11:40.232
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

11:40.332 --> 11:44.537
[dramatic music]

11:44.637 --> 11:46.205
Marcia Marcia Marcia,

11:46.305 --> 11:48.307
shantay, you stay.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.277
You are safe
to slay another day.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.545
Thank you very much.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.613
This is the first time
the judges have gotten

11:54.714 --> 11:57.216
to really see me, like,
be a little ferocious.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.518
Now I get to relax
in the workroom.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.589
Malaysia, I'm sorry, my dear,

12:03.689 --> 12:07.226
but you are still
up for elimination.

12:07.326 --> 12:09.361
I think Malaysia
is bamboozled AF,

12:09.462 --> 12:11.030
because she picked Marcia

12:11.130 --> 12:12.598
thinking
she was gon' beat her,

12:12.698 --> 12:14.567
and that didn't happen.

12:15.634 --> 12:15.735
Will the eight
remaining queens step forward?

12:21.941 --> 12:22.975
Whoa!
Oh, my God!

12:23.075 --> 12:24.944
I feel like Nicole Kidman
just popped up

12:25.044 --> 12:27.146
on the screen
at the AMC movie theaters.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.682
I am so excited for this.

12:31.050 --> 12:35.721
Let's see who's lip-synching
in round two of our smackdown.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.793
Bruno is holding Loosey's ball.

12:40.893 --> 12:41.994
Finally.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.629
I am really happy,

12:43.729 --> 12:45.965
because I wanted
to have this advantage

12:46.065 --> 12:47.399
of picking my opponent.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.102
This is a game of survival.

12:50.202 --> 12:54.473
Who do you choose
as your opponent?

12:55.741 --> 12:56.842
Spice.

12:56.942 --> 12:57.910
Ah...

12:58.010 --> 12:59.745
Ooh...

12:59.845 --> 13:02.348
Now, Spice, it's your turn.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.350
I'm in the mood
to spice things up.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.951
So I'm gonna choose

13:06.051 --> 13:08.888
- "Do You Wanna Touch Me."
- Solid choice.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.289
The rest of you may step

13:10.389 --> 13:12.892
to the back of the stage.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.894
I'm low-key rooting
for Spice,

13:14.994 --> 13:18.464
because I feel like Loosey's
on the verge of cracking.

13:18.564 --> 13:19.665
If she gets another loss,

13:19.765 --> 13:21.467
she's gonna go
off the deep end.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.602
[laughing]

13:25.371 --> 13:27.940
The time has come...

13:29.408 --> 13:31.710
For you to lip-synch...

13:33.345 --> 13:35.748
For your life.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.483
Oh, the lights!
What's happening?

13:37.583 --> 13:39.218
Ha ha!

13:39.318 --> 13:40.820
Good luck,

13:40.920 --> 13:43.789
and don't fuck it up.

13:50.229 --> 13:51.630
Werk.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.299
Spice really, like,
looks the part,

13:53.399 --> 13:54.967
and she could pull it out.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.802
[singing] Every girl and boy

13:56.902 --> 13:58.571
Needs a little joy

13:58.671 --> 14:02.608
All you do
is sit and stare

14:02.708 --> 14:04.310
Beggin' on my knees

14:04.410 --> 14:06.245
Baby, won't you please

14:06.345 --> 14:09.882
Run your fingers
through my hair

14:09.982 --> 14:11.817
My, my, my, my

14:11.917 --> 14:13.719
Whiskey and rye

14:13.819 --> 14:17.590
Don't it make you
feel so fine?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.325
Right or wrong

14:19.425 --> 14:20.926
Don't it turn you on?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.361
Come on.
Pick it up, girls.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.196
Come on.

14:24.296 --> 14:27.166
[singing] Yeah, do you wanna
touch - [singing] Yeah!

14:27.266 --> 14:28.901
- [singing] Do you wanna touch
- [singing] Yeah!

14:29.001 --> 14:31.670
[singing] Do you wanna
touch me there?

14:31.770 --> 14:32.705
Where?

14:32.805 --> 14:34.907
Yeah, yeah!

14:35.007 --> 14:37.042
[singing] There, oh, yeah

14:37.142 --> 14:38.043
[singing] Oh, yeah

14:38.143 --> 14:39.178
Whoo!
Ha!

14:39.278 --> 14:40.813
Oh, my God,
I think she just got it.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.549
[laughter]

14:43.649 --> 14:45.217
[singing] Oh, yeah

14:45.317 --> 14:47.553
Ooh, lookin' hot.

14:47.653 --> 14:52.625
Lesbians!
[laughter]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.030
Who's it gonna be?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.231
Who's hanging out with me
for the rest of the day?

14:59.331 --> 15:00.299
[suspenseful note]
Ah!

15:00.399 --> 15:02.902
What?
This lip sync is honestly

15:03.002 --> 15:06.038
much closer a call
than I thought it would be.

15:06.138 --> 15:08.274
The suspense is
just killing me.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.643
[electronic music]

15:10.743 --> 15:12.778
Ladies, I've made my decision.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.547
[suspenseful music]

15:15.648 --> 15:17.149
Loosey LaDuca,

15:17.249 --> 15:19.351
shantay, you stay.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.453
Thank you so much.

15:21.553 --> 15:24.390
I murdered this round
of LaLaPaRuZa,

15:24.490 --> 15:26.425
and I'm feeling incredible.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.294
So for the rest of LaLaPaRuZa,

15:28.394 --> 15:30.296
I get to sit back and watch

15:30.396 --> 15:31.830
the rest of these rounds
go down.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.033
[dance music]

15:34.133 --> 15:35.968
It gets lonely on top.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.170
That's what she said.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.139
- Hello, hello, hello!
- [screams]

15:40.239 --> 15:42.608
- Welcome to the top nine, girl!
- Hey, girl!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.643
Ooh, top nine...

15:44.743 --> 15:48.180
Let's see who's lip-synching
in round three.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.915
- Oh, we're watching now.
- Ugh.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.851
[suspenseful music]

15:58.123 --> 16:00.592
Luxx Noir London.

16:00.693 --> 16:05.564
Who do you choose
as your opponent?

16:05.664 --> 16:06.665
Salina.

16:06.765 --> 16:07.933
[gasps]

16:08.033 --> 16:09.268
Baby, knowing Luxx,

16:09.368 --> 16:11.971
she thinks I'ma pick
a twirling, bucking song,

16:12.071 --> 16:15.574
but she didn't know I'm about
to pick this ballad, honey.

16:15.674 --> 16:18.811
Salina,
what song do you choose?

16:18.911 --> 16:20.479
I think I'm gonna choose

16:20.579 --> 16:22.214
"It's All Coming
Back to Me Now"

16:22.314 --> 16:24.450
by Celine Dion.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.251
I do this number
all the time back at home.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.619
I'm known for it, girl.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.388
She gets coins
with this number.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.556
So bye, Luxx.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.459
[dramatic music]

16:33.559 --> 16:34.760
This Celine Dion song

16:34.860 --> 16:37.730
is not a song that I would
particularly choose.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.965
However, I am an actress,

16:40.065 --> 16:41.600
and I can pull anything off.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.936
Good luck, and don't

16:44.036 --> 16:46.972
fuck it up.

16:47.072 --> 16:52.411
[singing] There were nights
when the wind was so cold

16:52.511 --> 16:54.813
That my body froze in bed

16:54.913 --> 16:57.082
If I just listened to it

16:57.182 --> 17:01.020
Right outside the window

17:01.120 --> 17:03.055
[shrieks]
[laughter]

17:03.155 --> 17:04.723
[singing] But you were history

17:04.823 --> 17:07.793
With the slamming
of the door

17:07.893 --> 17:13.399
And I made myself
so strong again somehow

17:13.499 --> 17:15.367
There were moments of gold

17:15.467 --> 17:18.370
And there were
flashes of light

17:18.470 --> 17:21.273
There were nights
of endless pleasure

17:21.373 --> 17:27.146
It was more
than your laws allow

17:27.246 --> 17:29.615
Baby, baby, baby

17:29.715 --> 17:33.152
When you touch me
like this

17:33.252 --> 17:35.888
When you hold me like that

17:35.988 --> 17:37.956
It was gone with the wind

17:38.057 --> 17:40.692
My eyes are right on Salina, honestly.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.094
Mine are on Luxx.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.296
[singing] When you see me
like this

17:44.396 --> 17:45.597
[laughter]

17:45.697 --> 17:47.299
And when I see you
like that

17:47.399 --> 17:49.435
I can barely recall

17:49.535 --> 17:51.837
But it's all coming back

17:51.937 --> 17:55.574
To me now

17:55.674 --> 17:58.010
[vocalizes]

18:00.946 --> 18:04.116
If you forgive me all this

18:04.216 --> 18:05.217
[laughter]

18:05.317 --> 18:08.520
I'll forgive you all that

18:08.620 --> 18:10.823
We forgive and forget

18:10.923 --> 18:13.659
And it's all coming back

18:13.759 --> 18:17.763
To me now

18:17.863 --> 18:22.668
It's all coming back
to me now

18:22.768 --> 18:25.170
And if we...

18:25.270 --> 18:29.007
[laughter]

18:29.108 --> 18:30.976
I really do not know,

18:31.076 --> 18:33.278
and it's, like,
a full-ass toss-up for me.

18:33.378 --> 18:34.279
[sighs]

18:34.379 --> 18:37.382
[suspenseful music]

18:39.318 --> 18:40.919
Salina EsTitties,

18:41.019 --> 18:43.355
shantay, you stay.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.291
You are safe
to slay another day.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.228
Thank you so much.

18:49.328 --> 18:51.163
Luxx Noir London,

18:51.263 --> 18:52.865
I'm sorry, my dear,

18:52.965 --> 18:54.533
but you are still up

18:54.633 --> 18:56.935
for elimination.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.005
Honestly,
I am a little very gagged.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.340
You still look good, bitch.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.741
Always.

19:02.841 --> 19:06.345
Ms. Luxx, I don't think
this is sitting well with her.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.480
I think this has put
a crack in the vase.

19:10.349 --> 19:10.582
k to you now!

19:12.784 --> 19:15.687
[all screaming]

19:15.787 --> 19:16.788
Oh, my God!

19:16.889 --> 19:19.158
Bitch, I am ecstatic right now!

19:19.258 --> 19:20.559
[screams]

19:20.659 --> 19:21.793
Luxx thought she could beat me.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.962
Bitch, bye.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.065
- [screams]
- Oh, they're back on.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.567
Up next...

19:28.667 --> 19:31.603
[dramatic music]

19:31.703 --> 19:33.472
Mistress,

19:33.572 --> 19:35.174
who do you choose

19:35.274 --> 19:36.708
as your opponent?

19:36.808 --> 19:38.277
Let's see. Um...

19:38.377 --> 19:40.445
I'm gonna choose the person
who I think is gonna choose

19:40.546 --> 19:41.547
a song that I want.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.482
Um, let's go with Jax.

19:43.582 --> 19:45.017
- Ooh...
- So Jax,

19:45.117 --> 19:47.452
what song do you choose?

19:47.553 --> 19:50.355
"Tell It to My Heart"
by Taylor Dayne.

19:50.455 --> 19:54.493
Ugh, I am a mastermind,
a genius.

19:54.593 --> 19:57.029
The other two girls
may step to the back

19:57.129 --> 19:58.163
of the stage.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.399
Oh, so it's gonna be
Sasha vs. Anetra.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.733
Ooh, hot.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.236
Oh, [bleep,

20:04.336 --> 20:07.172
the one person that I didn't
want to lip-synch against.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.043
The time has come

20:11.143 --> 20:13.845
for you to lip-synch

20:13.946 --> 20:14.880
for

20:14.980 --> 20:15.981
your

20:16.081 --> 20:17.082
life!

20:19.284 --> 20:20.786
When I perform,
a lot of my personality

20:20.886 --> 20:22.588
comes through.
I'm just gonna give them

20:22.688 --> 20:24.656
a good old taste
of the Brooks dynasty.

20:24.756 --> 20:25.657
Good luck,

20:25.757 --> 20:28.560
and for the love
of Taylor Dayne,

20:28.660 --> 20:30.862
don't fuck it up.

20:40.205 --> 20:43.875
[singing] I feel
the night explode

20:43.976 --> 20:46.378
When we're together

20:48.680 --> 20:52.317
Emotion overload

20:52.417 --> 20:54.886
In the heat of pleasure

20:54.987 --> 20:56.054
Come on, Mistress!

20:56.154 --> 20:58.223
[singing] Take me, I'm yours

20:58.323 --> 21:00.292
Into your arms

21:00.392 --> 21:02.961
Never let me go

21:04.630 --> 21:07.065
Tonight, I really

21:07.165 --> 21:10.435
Need to love

21:10.535 --> 21:11.637
Come on, girls.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.171
[singing] Tell it
to my heart

21:13.272 --> 21:15.374
Tell me I'm the only one

21:15.474 --> 21:16.975
Is this really love

21:17.075 --> 21:19.511
Or just a game

21:19.611 --> 21:21.213
Every tone is in the light.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.348
I know I'm shining bright.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.449
[laughter]

21:24.549 --> 21:25.851
The judges are gagging, honey.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.687
[singing] My name

21:33.425 --> 21:34.326
- Oh!
- Whoa!

21:34.426 --> 21:35.360
Bitch!

21:35.460 --> 21:38.530
[singing]
No, I can't let you go

21:38.630 --> 21:39.998
Jax, of course, is doing

21:40.098 --> 21:42.501
all of the acrobatics.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.337
Whoo!
[laughter]

21:45.437 --> 21:47.706
But Mistress is
really just commanding

21:47.806 --> 21:49.808
the front of the stage
with all of her presence.

21:49.908 --> 21:51.143
[singing] A game

21:51.243 --> 21:53.045
Tell it to my heart

21:53.145 --> 21:55.547
I can feel my body rock

21:55.647 --> 21:59.418
Every time
you call my name

22:01.486 --> 22:03.322
Tell it to my heart

22:03.422 --> 22:05.324
Tell it from the start

22:05.424 --> 22:06.958
Tell it to my heart

22:07.059 --> 22:09.661
Heart, heart, heart

22:09.761 --> 22:11.196
Never make it stop

22:11.296 --> 22:13.031
Oh, take it to the heart

22:13.131 --> 22:15.867
Heart, heart, heart,
uh-uh

22:15.967 --> 22:17.703
Tell it to my heart

22:17.803 --> 22:20.806
[laughter]

22:21.807 --> 22:23.542
Very passionate.

22:23.642 --> 22:24.810
- Girl...
- Jax, baby.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.445
- Girl...
- That was it.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.446
God...

22:27.546 --> 22:29.781
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.884
[suspenseful music]

22:34.419 --> 22:36.655
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

22:36.755 --> 22:38.824
shantay, you stay.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.525
Thank you so much.

22:40.625 --> 22:42.160
You gave me a run
for my money, bitch.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.796
[laughs]

22:44.896 --> 22:45.797
I'm a bit shocked.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.733
I absolutely did not expect

22:47.833 --> 22:50.235
to be in this position
right now.

22:50.335 --> 22:52.371
My jaw is tired
from fake-smiling.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.839
[suspenseful music]

22:54.973 --> 22:56.575
- Jax, right?
- Oh, my God, Jax.

22:56.675 --> 22:57.576
- Jax, for sure.
- No question.

22:57.676 --> 22:58.677
Oof, I bet Mistress is

22:58.777 --> 22:59.678
gonna feel some sort of way,

22:59.778 --> 23:00.812
but here's the thing--

23:00.912 --> 23:02.114
Now, y'all knew
the heavyweight champ

23:02.214 --> 23:03.415
- was gonna win big.
- Oh, my God!

23:03.515 --> 23:05.884
It was really nothing.
[laughs]

23:05.984 --> 23:07.519
Whoo, why you gagging, honey?

23:07.619 --> 23:09.388
[screams]

23:09.488 --> 23:11.957
Bitch, work.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.525
We'll be honest.
We thought Jax won

23:13.625 --> 23:14.526
that lip sync.
both: Yeah.

23:14.626 --> 23:15.627
Oh, well, y'all need to get

23:15.727 --> 23:16.695
your eyes checked, honey.

23:16.795 --> 23:17.796
Ha!

23:17.896 --> 23:18.964
I expected the girls
to be like,

23:19.064 --> 23:20.098
"Bitch, you killed it,"

23:20.198 --> 23:21.867
but the girls
are being sourpusses,

23:21.967 --> 23:23.201
say they thought Jax won.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.270
So why'd you think Jax won?

23:25.370 --> 23:27.172
She's very, like,

23:27.272 --> 23:30.642
- vroom-vroom.
- You weren't giving 100%.

23:30.742 --> 23:32.677
- Yeah.
- My tactic going in was

23:32.778 --> 23:34.946
in case I had to go
a second round,

23:35.046 --> 23:36.548
- I wanted to save...
- Right.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.717
A little bit
of what I could give,

23:38.817 --> 23:40.218
and I mean,
at the end of the day,

23:40.318 --> 23:41.787
whether you thought
I did a great job or not,

23:41.887 --> 23:44.689
I'm still here,
so it don't really mats.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.824
Boots.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.259
Since the girls
wouldn't start rooting

23:47.359 --> 23:48.393
as soon as I walk in,

23:48.493 --> 23:49.861
they changed my whole mood too.

23:49.961 --> 23:51.763
So I'm like,
"Let's get right into it."

23:51.863 --> 23:53.632
Like, Loosey, I mean, I felt
like you definitely lucked out,

23:53.732 --> 23:55.200
like, getting to pick Spice,
no tea.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.002
- Yeah, yeah.
- Also, I did take

23:57.102 --> 23:58.336
into account that the girls

23:58.437 --> 23:59.438
who people didn't wanna go against

23:59.538 --> 24:02.040
would be there
till the very end.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.809
All the girls that, like,

24:03.909 --> 24:05.944
people didn't think were
gonna be good lip-synchers

24:06.044 --> 24:07.412
were picked first.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.748
So, and I was like, "Well,
you can go fuck yourself."

24:09.848 --> 24:10.749
Oh, my God,
don't put that in there.

24:10.849 --> 24:11.917
I didn't say that.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.752
Sorry.
Oh, my God, it's gonna be used.

24:13.852 --> 24:14.853
No!

24:15.987 --> 24:17.823
- Ladies...
- Oh, shit.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.925
You will be lip-synching

24:20.025 --> 24:23.361
in round five of our smackdown.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.830
The last gals standing,

24:24.930 --> 24:27.332
by process of elimination...

24:27.432 --> 24:29.434
So excited about this one.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.237
Bruno, do your thing.

24:32.337 --> 24:35.474
[suspenseful music]

24:35.574 --> 24:37.576
Now show us the ball.

24:38.944 --> 24:39.911
Anetra.

24:40.011 --> 24:41.046
[suspenseful note]

24:41.146 --> 24:42.280
Anetra,

24:42.380 --> 24:44.616
time to choose the song.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.852
Let's go with
"I'm in Love with a Monster"

24:46.952 --> 24:48.320
by Fifth Harmony.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.589
I know the song,

24:50.689 --> 24:52.424
I know my opponent,
I know the stage,

24:52.524 --> 24:53.592
and I know me.

24:53.692 --> 24:54.659
Let's just get going.

24:54.759 --> 24:55.827
[laughs]

24:55.927 --> 24:57.896
[dramatic music]

24:57.996 --> 24:59.764
The time has come

24:59.865 --> 25:02.067
for you to lip-synch

25:02.167 --> 25:04.436
for your life.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.808
So now, the two bitches
everyone's scared of

25:09.908 --> 25:12.210
gotta go against each other.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.478
Let's get the popcorn out, honey.

25:13.578 --> 25:14.846
It's gonna be a show.

25:14.946 --> 25:17.115
Good luck, and don't

25:17.215 --> 25:19.117
fuck it up.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.686
[dramatic music]

25:21.786 --> 25:23.321
[singing] Oh

25:24.856 --> 25:25.924
He'll buy me a thorn

25:26.024 --> 25:27.826
Before he'll buy me a rose

25:27.926 --> 25:30.862
Be covered in dirt
before I'm covered in gold

25:30.962 --> 25:32.797
He's trying it on

25:32.898 --> 25:34.399
Yeah he's ticking me off

25:34.499 --> 25:37.536
Say what you want
but I won't ever be told

25:37.636 --> 25:41.172
'Cause I'm in love

25:41.273 --> 25:42.507
With a monster

25:42.607 --> 25:44.609
Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh

25:44.709 --> 25:47.612
Friends say I'm stupid
and I'm out of my mind

25:47.712 --> 25:50.949
But without you, boy,
I'd be bored all the time

25:51.049 --> 25:54.352
No, I don't really care
for the same conversation

25:54.452 --> 25:55.554
Got everything I need

25:55.654 --> 25:57.088
I'm known
for my hair flips.

25:57.188 --> 25:58.390
I just see my ponytail

25:58.490 --> 25:59.724
going in all
the different directions.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.426
I'm giving you dodging-bullets,

26:01.526 --> 26:04.829
Matrix back bends.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.298
- [singing] I'm in love
- [singing] I'm in love

26:06.398 --> 26:08.099
- Ah!
- [screams and laughs]

26:08.199 --> 26:09.501
[singing] Sweeter you try

26:09.601 --> 26:11.369
They don't be getting love
from it

26:11.469 --> 26:12.771
Ain't worth a dime

26:12.871 --> 26:14.673
'Cause I just don't get
enough from it

26:14.773 --> 26:16.508
Leave it to me
don't you see

26:16.608 --> 26:17.943
I don't run from it

26:18.043 --> 26:19.377
Bitter the better

26:19.477 --> 26:21.346
Hey, hey, hey, hey

26:21.446 --> 26:24.082
[singing] You make me crazy
but I love it

26:24.182 --> 26:25.083
[singing] I love it baby

26:25.183 --> 26:26.685
[singing] You make me
crazy baby

26:26.785 --> 26:28.253
But I love it

26:28.353 --> 26:30.088
- You make me crazy
- [singing] Oh, oh

26:30.188 --> 26:32.924
I'm in love

26:33.024 --> 26:34.926
With a monster

26:35.026 --> 26:37.429
Hoo, hoo, ah-ooh

26:38.997 --> 26:40.432
- [singing] Did you know
- [singing] Did you know

26:40.532 --> 26:42.534
[singing] Everybody loves
a monster

26:42.634 --> 26:44.002
[singing] Yeah

26:45.570 --> 26:46.905
- [singing] Did you know
- [singing] Did you know

26:47.005 --> 26:48.907
[singing] Everybody loves
a monster?

26:49.007 --> 26:50.241
[singing] Yeah, yeah, yeah

26:50.342 --> 26:51.476
[singing] I'm in love

26:51.576 --> 26:53.345
[singing] We're in love

26:53.445 --> 26:54.913
[singing] With a monster

26:55.013 --> 26:56.982
Ooh, ooh, ah-ooh

26:57.082 --> 26:58.416
I'm in love

26:58.516 --> 27:00.518
I'm in love

27:00.619 --> 27:02.921
I'm in love

27:03.021 --> 27:04.289
With a monster

27:04.389 --> 27:05.724
[singing] Hit me

27:05.824 --> 27:07.292
Hit me

27:07.392 --> 27:08.893
Hit me

27:08.994 --> 27:11.429
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight

27:11.529 --> 27:13.131
Hit

27:14.766 --> 27:16.835
Thank you.
Good night!

27:16.935 --> 27:18.937
[laughter]

27:19.037 --> 27:20.005
Shit!

27:20.105 --> 27:22.374
Oh, my God,
men are orgasming.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.742
- Ha.
- Wow.

27:23.842 --> 27:24.843
That was unreal.

27:24.943 --> 27:27.112
Ladies, I've made
my decision.

27:27.212 --> 27:30.215
[dramatic music]

27:31.349 --> 27:32.651
My God,
they were both incredible.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.719
- I wouldn't be able to pick.
- This is nuts.

27:36.287 --> 27:37.722
[cheers]

27:37.822 --> 27:40.058
Oh, my God!
[all cheering]

27:40.158 --> 27:41.960
- Yes, ma'am!
- Congrats, girl.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.695
Oh, my gosh, yo!

27:43.795 --> 27:46.097
I won!

27:46.197 --> 27:49.134
And it feels really nice
to have killed it.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.235
[laughs]

27:51.936 --> 27:54.506
Anetra, I'm sorry, my dear,

27:54.606 --> 27:58.043
but you are still up
for elimination.

27:58.143 --> 27:59.678
Okay, well, if
I was gonna lose to anybody,

27:59.778 --> 28:00.912
I'm glad it's Sasha.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.414
But that will be the last time.

28:03.982 --> 28:06.584
It's time
for the sixth round.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.053
- Oh, girls, we're back on.
- Oh, oh, what's happening?

28:08.153 --> 28:11.056
[dramatic music]

28:17.128 --> 28:21.633
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.968
I wanted somebody
to choose me.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.404
I wanted to choose the song.

28:26.504 --> 28:28.373
Malaysia looks plucked.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.575
She is plucked.

28:30.675 --> 28:34.846
Which queen do you choose
as your opponent?

28:34.946 --> 28:36.414
I don't want to get kicked
in the head.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.183
I don't want nobody
doing no splits on top of me,

28:38.283 --> 28:40.018
duck-walking all over my back.

28:40.118 --> 28:41.152
It's like...

28:41.252 --> 28:42.353
Spice.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.889
Now, Spice,

28:44.989 --> 28:47.292
which song do you choose?

28:47.392 --> 28:49.260
I'm gonna go
with "Don't Go Yet,"

28:49.360 --> 28:51.429
by Miss Camila Cabello.

28:51.529 --> 28:54.065
My logic behind choosing
"Don't Go Yet"

28:54.165 --> 28:55.767
is because I know
Malaysia doesn't know

28:55.867 --> 28:56.768
the words to this song.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.704
[dramatic music]

28:59.804 --> 29:02.907
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

29:03.007 --> 29:05.610
[guitar music]

29:05.710 --> 29:07.045
I'm ready...

29:07.145 --> 29:10.815
[singing] I replayed this
moment for months

29:10.915 --> 29:15.720
Alone in my head,
waiting for it to come

29:15.820 --> 29:20.391
I wrote all your lines
in the script in my mind

29:20.492 --> 29:21.659
Malaysia doesn't know
the words.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.528
She does not know the words.
You're right.

29:23.628 --> 29:24.529
[singing] Don't go yet

29:24.629 --> 29:27.499
Oye, don't go yet

29:27.599 --> 29:28.933
Don't go yet

29:29.033 --> 29:31.736
Oye, don't go yet

29:31.836 --> 29:33.271
Don't go yet

29:33.371 --> 29:36.207
I'm like, "Yes, I got her!
She doesn't know the words!"

29:36.307 --> 29:39.744
I'm like, "Oh, shit.
I don't know the words either."

29:39.844 --> 29:41.179
[singing] Baby don't go yet
'cause I wore this dress

29:41.279 --> 29:42.413
So that plan

29:42.514 --> 29:44.249
completely disintegrated
into nothing.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.784
[singing] I bet that you
think that you know

29:45.884 --> 29:47.519
I don't think either one
of them really know the words.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.853
[laughter]

29:48.953 --> 29:50.221
[singing] I get what I want
when I want

29:50.321 --> 29:51.623
And I get it
how I wanna, wanna

29:51.723 --> 29:54.092
And I want you baby

29:54.192 --> 29:56.060
Gotta get you baby

29:56.161 --> 29:57.162
All night long

29:57.262 --> 29:59.164
- [laughter]
- No! No!

29:59.264 --> 30:01.566
She is not doing
the conga line dance!

30:01.666 --> 30:03.535
[singing] Oye, don't go yet

30:03.635 --> 30:05.703
Don't go yet

30:05.804 --> 30:08.473
Oye, don't go yet

30:08.573 --> 30:10.141
Don't go yet

30:10.241 --> 30:13.211
What you leaving for
when my night is yours?

30:13.311 --> 30:14.779
Yours, yours

30:14.879 --> 30:16.481
What you leaving for
when my night is yours?

30:16.581 --> 30:18.817
Just a little more
don't go yet

30:18.917 --> 30:20.685
[applause]

30:22.687 --> 30:23.721
Already tired,
and she's like,

30:23.822 --> 30:24.756
"Fuck, I gotta do this again."

30:24.856 --> 30:26.024
- Yes!
- [laughs]

30:26.124 --> 30:27.225
Stop!

30:27.325 --> 30:28.259
Ladies...

30:28.359 --> 30:30.228
[dramatic music]

30:30.328 --> 30:31.496
I've made my decision.

30:34.899 --> 30:36.434
Ladies,

30:36.534 --> 30:37.735
I've made my decision.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.405
[dramatic music]

30:40.505 --> 30:43.041
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx,

30:43.141 --> 30:44.576
shantay, you stay.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.444
Cool thing.

30:46.544 --> 30:47.879
Oh, my gosh, like,

30:47.979 --> 30:49.681
I survived this lip sync.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.316
Whew.

30:52.984 --> 30:54.886
Spice...

30:54.986 --> 30:56.521
I'm sorry, my dear,

30:56.621 --> 30:59.557
but you are still up
for elimination.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.694
So, once again,
I have to go to the back

31:02.794 --> 31:04.462
and keep lip-synching.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.931
Okay, okay, we got
one last chance to stay.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.402
Oh, the fattest
and the baddest

31:11.502 --> 31:13.304
is still in the building.
[all cheer]

31:13.404 --> 31:16.174
[laughs]

31:16.274 --> 31:18.376
I'm here.
I'm fay.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.711
I'm sipping on this cocktail,

31:19.811 --> 31:21.412
trying to drink
my feelings away.

31:21.512 --> 31:22.747
[laughs]

31:22.847 --> 31:23.982
Well, I'm happy to be here.

31:24.082 --> 31:26.517
I have to ask,
why did you pick me?

31:26.618 --> 31:28.219
Um, it was no reason.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.255
Honestly, I just went--
I just went blank,

31:30.355 --> 31:31.289
and I was like--
you was next to me.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.626
[dramatic music]

31:34.726 --> 31:36.861
I call bullshit.
I feel like you really thought

31:36.961 --> 31:38.062
you were gonna slay Marcia.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.031
No, I mean...

31:40.131 --> 31:41.332
Oh, oh, it's back.
It's back.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.401
Oh, my God.

31:43.501 --> 31:47.505
Ladies, the fickle finger
of fate

31:47.605 --> 31:51.142
has chosen the three of you
to lip-synch next,

31:51.242 --> 31:54.579
and you will be lip-synching
to...

31:54.679 --> 31:58.483
"The Right Stuff"
by Vanessa Williams.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.684
[dramatic music]

31:59.784 --> 32:02.153
To be honest,
I can take two bitches.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.922
Your girl is ready to do so.

32:06.024 --> 32:10.528
The time has come
for you to lip-synch...

32:10.628 --> 32:13.064
for your life.

32:16.367 --> 32:20.071
I am ready to eat
these girls alive.

32:21.172 --> 32:24.776
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.312
[singing] Get on up

32:27.412 --> 32:29.280
Get on up

32:29.380 --> 32:32.116
Na na na na hey hey

32:32.216 --> 32:33.885
Voulez-vous venir?

32:33.985 --> 32:35.353
- Ooh!
- Oh!

32:35.453 --> 32:38.556
[singing] Standing
at the 7:15

32:38.656 --> 32:41.826
Waiting for my baby's car

32:41.926 --> 32:47.031
Just then, out stepped
the driver of a limousine

32:47.131 --> 32:50.535
And asked if I was
going far

32:50.635 --> 32:51.736
I said

32:51.836 --> 32:54.772
"I've got my mind made up"

32:54.872 --> 32:56.874
- This is like Luxx era.
- Come on!

32:56.975 --> 33:00.311
[singing] Leave him, baby,
'cause it's clear to me

33:00.411 --> 33:01.612
Yes, Anetra!

33:01.713 --> 33:04.215
[singing] That it's just
too tough

33:04.315 --> 33:06.484
To find another lover like

33:06.584 --> 33:08.119
Mine

33:08.219 --> 33:09.988
With the right stuff

33:12.623 --> 33:13.825
The right stuff, baby

33:13.925 --> 33:15.293
- Oh!
- Whoo!

33:15.393 --> 33:17.195
Oh, girl!

33:17.295 --> 33:19.397
[singing] The right stuff
na na na na

33:19.497 --> 33:21.032
Hey hey hey

33:21.132 --> 33:23.101
The right stuff

33:23.201 --> 33:27.305
I don't wanna miss out
on the right stuff

33:27.405 --> 33:29.107
Ooh, no, with Mr. Right

33:29.207 --> 33:30.108
Sing

33:30.208 --> 33:33.111
Na na na na hey hey

33:33.211 --> 33:34.846
- Come on!
- Who knows the words?

33:34.946 --> 33:36.414
[singing] To give me that
loving 'cause

33:36.514 --> 33:38.282
Next to him,
there is no other one

33:38.383 --> 33:40.251
He's very sexy,
oh so sweet

33:40.351 --> 33:42.820
And he knocks me
off my feet, sing!

33:42.920 --> 33:46.157
Na na na na hey hey-ey

33:46.257 --> 33:47.859
I need the right stuff, baby

33:47.959 --> 33:50.595
Walk the duck, bitch.
Walk that fucking duck.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.764
[singing]
All the right stuff

33:52.864 --> 33:55.233
Say na na na na
na-na-na-na

33:55.333 --> 33:57.468
Na na na na

34:01.105 --> 34:02.707
Come on, seduction.

34:02.807 --> 34:04.542
[laughing]

34:06.577 --> 34:08.546
Ladies...

34:08.646 --> 34:09.914
I've made my decision.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.016
[dramatic music]

34:12.116 --> 34:13.851
Do you think two girls
are getting saved

34:13.951 --> 34:15.253
from this lip sync,
or just one?

34:15.353 --> 34:17.288
- I think two girls.
- I think two will be saved.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.091
See you, folks!

34:20.191 --> 34:23.161
[all screaming]

34:23.261 --> 34:25.863
I just beat not one,
but two bitches on the stage.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.032
The fiercer they are,
the harder they fall.

34:28.132 --> 34:29.634
You slayed that last song.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.970
I had a little more fire
under me

34:33.071 --> 34:35.073
because I already had the idea

34:35.173 --> 34:38.242
that I was, like,
how they say, "robbed"

34:38.342 --> 34:39.544
for the first one.

34:39.644 --> 34:41.245
I thought that I won,
like, not in my head.

34:41.345 --> 34:42.947
- But you didn't.
- Yeah, but I'm here now,

34:43.047 --> 34:43.948
- so that doesn't matter.
- Exactly.

34:44.048 --> 34:45.316
And I didn't lose any nails.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.351
- Yes!
- The first time...

34:47.452 --> 34:49.854
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

34:49.954 --> 34:52.190
Anetra, Jax.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.559
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are still

34:54.659 --> 34:56.461
up for elimination.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.832
Spice, please step forward.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.470
This is the final round

35:05.570 --> 35:08.639
of our lip-sync LaLaPaRuZa Smackdown.

35:08.739 --> 35:11.409
[dramatic music]

35:11.509 --> 35:12.877
And it comes...

35:12.977 --> 35:14.479
with a twist.

35:14.579 --> 35:16.013
Oh!
[all gasp]

35:17.148 --> 35:18.082
What is it?

35:18.182 --> 35:20.418
Three of you remain...

35:20.518 --> 35:22.453
but only two of you

35:22.553 --> 35:24.722
will lip-synch for your life.

35:24.822 --> 35:28.092
[dramatic chords]

35:31.596 --> 35:35.366
In a moment,
Bruno will randomly choose

35:35.466 --> 35:37.001
the name of one queen.

35:37.101 --> 35:38.970
Then that queen

35:39.070 --> 35:41.239
will have the power

35:41.339 --> 35:46.144
to save one of her
fellow queens on stage...

35:46.244 --> 35:49.147
and send her straight back
to the workroom.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.718
Bitch!

35:53.818 --> 35:55.753
Oh, my God.

35:55.853 --> 35:57.221
This is a twist!

35:57.321 --> 35:58.990
The queen that remains

35:59.090 --> 36:01.459
will lip-synch for her life.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.362
In the end, one of you

36:04.462 --> 36:06.631
will sashay away.

36:06.731 --> 36:09.901
[suspenseful music]

36:19.977 --> 36:21.078
Anetra!

36:25.683 --> 36:28.286
The fate of your fellow queens

36:28.386 --> 36:30.655
now rests in your hands.

36:33.457 --> 36:36.160
Who do you choose
to save?

36:37.995 --> 36:39.931
Ooh, the drama!

36:40.031 --> 36:42.900
Oh, my gosh, I'm sure
Jax and Spice are gagging.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.469
This is fucking crazy.

36:45.570 --> 36:47.104
Ha ha. I can't wait to see

36:47.205 --> 36:49.473
how this turns out.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.379
- Oh!
- I knew it!

36:55.479 --> 36:57.982
I knew it!

36:58.082 --> 36:59.183
[dramatic music]

36:59.283 --> 37:00.952
All right, Anetra.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.254
Who do you choose to save?

37:05.823 --> 37:07.658
Spice.

37:10.861 --> 37:13.297
I can't lip-sync
against Spice.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.766
Like, do y'all think
that's fair?

37:15.866 --> 37:18.836
And honestly I have no problem
taking Jax out.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.539
This is a punch to the gut.

37:21.639 --> 37:24.809
I thought that
we were closer than that,

37:24.909 --> 37:27.812
but if Anetra wants
to lip-sync against me,

37:27.912 --> 37:30.681
then it's a battle
that she's gonna get.

37:30.781 --> 37:36.153
Spice, you are free
to slay another day.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.990
I am so beyond gagged
'cause I did not expect it.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.758
I fully thought
it was a wrap for me.

37:40.858 --> 37:42.426
I love you forever.
Oh, my God.

37:42.526 --> 37:44.528
Good luck.
[laughter]

37:47.265 --> 37:48.232
I'm gagging.

37:48.332 --> 37:49.667
When we thought we knew it,

37:49.767 --> 37:51.369
- curveball.
- Girl.

37:51.469 --> 37:56.540
We are all shivering with
antici... pation right now.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.676
Wait, can somebody, like,
re-explain what happened?

37:58.776 --> 38:00.778
I'm kind of confused.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.079
- Hi, girls.
- Spice!

38:02.179 --> 38:05.416
[all screaming and cheering]

38:05.516 --> 38:06.417
Yay!

38:06.517 --> 38:09.754
[all speaking at once]

38:09.854 --> 38:13.024
I am gagged.
[laughter]

38:13.124 --> 38:16.494
I just survived
by the skin of my teeth.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.662
[laughter]

38:17.762 --> 38:19.263
I'm so happy to see all y'all.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.998
I fully thought
I wasn't gonna see you again.

38:21.098 --> 38:21.999
- all: Aww.
- We love you.

38:22.099 --> 38:24.835
Yeah, seriously.

38:24.935 --> 38:27.738
Two queens stand before me.

38:27.838 --> 38:30.074
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here we go!

38:30.174 --> 38:32.777
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

38:32.877 --> 38:34.645
a lip-sync performance

38:34.745 --> 38:37.848
of "Finally" by CeCe Peniston.

38:37.948 --> 38:42.353
This is your last chance
to impress me

38:42.453 --> 38:46.390
and save yourself
from elimination.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.592
[dramatic music]

38:48.693 --> 38:50.695
The time has come...
[thunder crackles]

38:50.795 --> 38:53.798
For you to lip-synch...

38:53.898 --> 38:56.901
for your life.

39:00.438 --> 39:04.642
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

39:04.742 --> 39:08.179
[upbeat dance music]

39:08.279 --> 39:12.583
[vocalizing]

39:12.683 --> 39:15.920
Finally, it has happened
to me

39:16.020 --> 39:18.022
Right in front of my face

39:18.122 --> 39:20.558
And I just cannot hide it

39:20.658 --> 39:24.428
Meeting Mr. Right,
the man of my dreams

39:24.528 --> 39:26.964
The one who shows me
true love

39:27.064 --> 39:28.432
Or at least it seems

39:28.532 --> 39:32.370
With brown cocoa skin
and curly black hair

39:32.470 --> 39:34.305
It's just the way
he looks at me

39:34.405 --> 39:36.607
That gentle loving stare

39:36.707 --> 39:40.344
Finally you've come along

39:40.444 --> 39:44.482
The way I feel about you,
it just can't be wrong

39:44.582 --> 39:49.387
If you only knew
the way I feel about you

39:49.487 --> 39:51.922
I just can't describe it

39:52.022 --> 39:53.758
Oh, no, no

39:53.858 --> 39:54.859
- Whoo! Work!
- Hey, okay.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.160
Great.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.928
[singing] Right in front
of my face

39:58.028 --> 40:00.898
My feelings
can't describe it

40:00.998 --> 40:03.868
Finally
it has happened to me

40:03.968 --> 40:05.936
Right in front of my face

40:06.036 --> 40:08.773
And I just cannot hide it

40:08.873 --> 40:11.375
Finally

40:11.475 --> 40:15.546
Oh, finally

40:15.646 --> 40:17.948
Yeah, yeah

40:18.048 --> 40:22.753
- [vocalizing]
- [laughs]

40:22.853 --> 40:25.823
[singing] Finally it has
happened to me

40:25.923 --> 40:27.825
Right in front of my face

40:27.925 --> 40:30.728
And I just cannot hide it

40:31.762 --> 40:32.930
- [laughs]
- Oh, yes!

40:33.030 --> 40:34.765
- All right.
- Fierce.

40:34.865 --> 40:37.034
That was so solid.

40:37.134 --> 40:38.102
[dramatic music]

40:38.202 --> 40:41.138
Ladies...

40:41.238 --> 40:42.540
I've made my decision.

40:49.013 --> 40:50.281
Anetra.

40:50.381 --> 40:54.318
Shantay, you stay.

40:54.418 --> 40:58.956
You are safe to walk
that fucking duck another day.

40:59.056 --> 41:00.357
Thank you.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.930
You are the right bitch.

41:06.030 --> 41:09.733
Like the song says, finally.

41:09.834 --> 41:12.636
Finally.

41:12.736 --> 41:16.907
[laughter]

41:17.007 --> 41:18.442
Quack, quack.

41:21.078 --> 41:24.882
Jax, we loved you
from the jump.

41:24.982 --> 41:28.819
Thank you for leaving it all
on the dance floor.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.555
Now, sashay away.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.525
I love you all so much,
so thank you.

41:34.625 --> 41:35.626
Thank you.

41:39.597 --> 41:40.731
Fatality.

41:40.831 --> 41:43.501
[soft laughter]

41:43.601 --> 41:44.902
I know that Anetra wants
a challenge,

41:45.002 --> 41:47.404
so I'm happy I have that to her
in the final round.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.508
Of course I'm sad,
but it's just the beginning.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.877
Get ready.
A Jax flip is coming your way,

41:52.977 --> 41:54.945
and it's gonna be a storm, baby.

41:57.915 --> 41:59.783
Whoo.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.585
[high-pitched] Finally!

42:01.685 --> 42:03.420
[all cheering]

42:06.957 --> 42:08.459
I have to give you
the biggest hug

42:08.559 --> 42:09.660
- in the entire world.
- Spicy.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.729
- I love you so much, ah!
- I love you.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.831
Anetra, I respect it.
That's a bad bitch move.

42:13.931 --> 42:16.233
You played fair.
That is sickening.

42:16.333 --> 42:19.336
Can we make a cheers
to the top nine?

42:19.436 --> 42:22.373
[all cheering]

42:22.473 --> 42:25.175
Top nine, top nine!

42:25.276 --> 42:26.510
[laughter]

42:26.610 --> 42:29.713
Ladies, if you can't
love yourself,

42:29.813 --> 42:31.849
how in the hell you gon' love
somebody else?

42:31.949 --> 42:33.784
Can I get an "amen"
up in here?

42:33.884 --> 42:36.453
- [all cheering]
- Amen!

42:36.554 --> 42:38.856
All right.
Now let the music play.

42:38.956 --> 42:43.761
A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

42:43.861 --> 42:46.363
Turn it around
when you up and say

42:46.463 --> 42:48.966
Can you feel the love

42:51.969 --> 42:53.837
Next time on
"RuPaul's Drag Race..."

42:53.938 --> 42:57.374
today is our 200th episode.

42:57.474 --> 42:58.709
[screaming and cheering]

42:58.809 --> 43:01.145
And we are throwing a ball.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.314
[cheers and applause]

43:03.414 --> 43:05.549
These girls aren't playing
any games.

43:05.649 --> 43:06.917
Nobody is safe.

43:07.017 --> 43:08.786
I'm thinking about myself.
Still, like...

43:08.886 --> 43:10.020
[glass shattering]

43:10.120 --> 43:11.655
[all scream]

43:11.755 --> 43:13.190
I'm worried about Heidi.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.164
Goes a long, long way

43:20.264 --> 43:22.733
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

43:22.833 --> 43:25.202
A little bit of love

43:25.302 --> 43:27.771
Goes a long, long way

43:27.871 --> 43:30.307
Turn it around
when you up and say

43:30.407 --> 43:32.176
Everybody say love

43:40.384 --> 43:43.320
Can you feel the love?
