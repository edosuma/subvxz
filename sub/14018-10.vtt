NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.703 --> 00:06.617
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.482
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.542 --> 00:11.352
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.411 --> 00:13.049
These are their stories.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.821
(SPEAKING HINDI)

00:16.650 --> 00:17.822
(HORNS HONKING)
MAN: Come on, let's go!

00:17.885 --> 00:19.796
Near corner, far corner?

00:20.754 --> 00:23.200
Okay, I said
near corner or far...

00:24.658 --> 00:25.830
Oh. my...

00:26.727 --> 00:29.469
CSU says it's a single stab
wound to the guy's abdomen.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.531
We know who he is?

00:30.597 --> 00:33.874
No wallet, no ID. But
judging how he's dressed,

00:34.568 --> 00:36.605
I'd say he ain't a homeboy.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.378
I want a shot of
the laundry mark.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.545
MAN: Right.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.819
Rite Aid receipt from
a couple of days ago.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.791
2211, Broadway.

00:48.849 --> 00:49.987
It's near 96th Street.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.529
What do you think?
Stick and pick?

00:51.585 --> 00:52.723
Either that, or he figured out

00:52.786 --> 00:54.356
a hell of a way to
beat a cab fare.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.230
What about the cabbie?
OFFICER: Harish Singh.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.236
Says the pickup was
on 42nd near Lex

00:58.292 --> 01:00.602
and that another guy
helped the old man in.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.197
Thinks that it was
that guy who was the one

01:02.262 --> 01:03.639
who gave him the address
where to go.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.404
Where's he?
Where else?

01:05.632 --> 01:07.270
Talking on the cell phone.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.369
Thanks.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.437
(SPEAKING HINDI)

01:10.504 --> 01:12.245
Say goodbye,
Mr. Singh.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.013
I was just trying to
get another vehicle.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.178
My whole shift is lost.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.051
Yeah, well, it turns out
it wasn't his day either.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.522
Tell us about the guy
who helped the old man.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.059
He was black.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.594
Young, wearing a
green baseball cap.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.858
Some... Some blue
running clothes.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.263
He say anything about
your passenger?

01:28.322 --> 01:31.132
No. Just said to go to
125th and Amsterdam.

01:31.191 --> 01:33.102
Did he touch the door handle?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.195
I don't know.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.296
The whole ride up here,
you didn't hear

01:35.362 --> 01:37.239
your passenger say anything?

01:37.297 --> 01:39.504
I was talking to my broker.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.669
All right, give us
your home number.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.578
And don't forget
your cell phone.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.949
Guy's bleeding to death in his
back seat, he's making day trades.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.740
The Rite Aid computer says the
receipt was for toilet paper,

02:42.829 --> 02:45.605
toothpaste and some cough medicine.
Paid for in cash.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.646
Purchase like that, the guy
probably lives nearby.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.442
Big neighborhood.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.244
Dry cleaner's mark
on his shirt tail.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.875
There's gotta be 20, 30 dry
cleaners in that area.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.715
The guy's wearing
a Paul Stuart suit.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.983
I'm betting he goes
to the best.

02:58.412 --> 03:02.588
Well, canvass the cleaners, and work
your way out from the Rite Aid.

03:03.884 --> 03:07.093
I'm not sure. But this
guy don't look so good.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.857
How about this?
You recognize that?

03:09.923 --> 03:12.369
Yes. That's ours.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.838
Last four digit
customer phone number.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.739
Have you got a name
to go with the number?

03:19.266 --> 03:22.713
Mr. Grimaldi lived alone,
about five, six years now.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.605
His wife.
Real sweet lady.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.083
She died a few years back.

03:27.140 --> 03:29.086
What she was doing with the
guy is anybody's guess.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.177
Why do you say that?

03:30.243 --> 03:32.519
Grimaldi was tough.
Real old school.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.616
Not a guy with too many
nice words to say.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.285
And parting with a dollar
wasn't his thing either.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.384
He would have fought back.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.158
That's probably what
got him killed.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.527
Any other next of kin?

03:40.587 --> 03:41.622
Son and daughter,

03:41.688 --> 03:43.793
but they don't come around
much since the mother died.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.632
He lives in Philly with his
wife and kid, I think.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.035
And her I'm not too sure about.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.404
See if you can get their numbers
from the managing agent.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.498
Sure.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.907
Any idea what he did
for a living?

03:51.965 --> 03:55.174
Retired. But I think he was
an insurance salesman once.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.908
He's in good hands now.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.076
Hey, cabbie said he picked him
up on 42nd and Lex, right?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.711
Yeah. Bank account
on Lexington Avenue.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.383
Mr. Grimaldi was a customer
here for over 30 years.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.120
He used to come in
all the time.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.627
Only worked
a few blocks from here.

04:10.684 --> 04:11.856
Where was that?

04:11.918 --> 04:14.023
All-Atlantic Insurance.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.589
It's a shame.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.230
He was a real character.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.666
In what way?

04:18.725 --> 04:22.298
He's what you'd call an old-fashioned
American success story.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.773
Immigrated from Italy.

04:23.830 --> 04:26.310
Worked 40 years
for the same company.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.107
A real dying breed.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.374
Do know if maybe he
cashed a check that day?

04:31.438 --> 04:34.419
Or maybe somebody saw him
with a large amount of money?

04:34.474 --> 04:37.148
I checked our security
tapes after you called.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.520
Mr. Grimaldi didn't
use a teller that day.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.354
He went straight
to the vault area.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.722
Safe deposit box.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.127
He opened one
about 10 years ago.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.089
Doesn't seem to
have used it much.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.999
Any chance we could
take a look inside?

04:51.658 --> 04:53.729
You'd just be
wasting your time.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.400
He closed it that day.
It's empty.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.708
Here are some shots from
the bank's video tape.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.268
This is him coming in.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.404
Briefcase.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.915
Then 14 minutes later,
he leaves.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.780
Still has his briefcase.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.444
Now, here's one
from the ATM outside.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.681
He's still alone.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.048
Not for long.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.984
Our good Samaritan.

to help anyone else.

Who's that?

You. Right down
to the green ball cap

06:25.719 --> 06:27.289
we found in your closet.

put him at the scene.

He also had a bullet wound

There was no exit wound.

And the entrance was hidden
under the hair in the armpit.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.965
I only found it when
IX-rayed the body.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.264
Well, could this guy
have been shot

08:45.325 --> 08:46.360
and made it to the cab?

Hey, Reagan never
knew he was shot

hand when he left the bank.

Maybe he switched
when he got shot.

from ballistics?

09:56.729 --> 09:57.730
No.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.277
Well, was he the kind of person
that kept a lot of cash on him?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.643
Our father never
discussed his finances.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.409
He lived on a pension.

10:04.471 --> 10:06.075
Is there any kind
of inheritance?

10:06.139 --> 10:08.415
Maybe from your mother?
Some stocks?

10:08.475 --> 10:09.954
Anything somebody
might have known about?

10:10.009 --> 10:11.386
I don't think so.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.014
Was there anyone
he was close to?

10:13.079 --> 10:15.116
JORDAN: Most of our father's
friends have passed away.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.182
What about Gail?

10:16.349 --> 10:18.454
Gail?
Gail Bartlet.

10:19.085 --> 10:22.589
Since our mom died,
she's been Dad's friend.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.999
He was with her
before Mom died.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.938
Jordan said that?
I'm surprised.

10:28.428 --> 10:31.102
Their mother was very ill for
several years before she died,

10:31.164 --> 10:33.075
and Peter and I became friends.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.138
His kids were
under the impression

10:35.201 --> 10:37.112
that he might have
confided in you.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.581
Peter rarely spoke to
either of his children.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.050
He wasn't what you would call

10:41.107 --> 10:43.212
an intimate type
of man, Detective.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.349
He... He rarely confided
in anyone, even me.

10:47.714 --> 10:53.528
But there was a certain charm
about Peter, an energy.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.228
Uh, can you think of any reason

10:56.289 --> 10:58.269
why somebody would have
wanted to hurt him?

11:00.960 --> 11:02.962
A few weeks ago, actually,

11:03.329 --> 11:05.002
the doorbell rang.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.872
Peter answered it
and I heard him yelling.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.809
Did you see who
he was yelling at?

11:10.870 --> 11:14.374
No. But when he came
back into the room, I...

11:14.440 --> 11:17.717
He was very angry, and I
asked him what was wrong,

11:17.777 --> 11:19.620
and he... he said
the doorman

11:19.679 --> 11:21.955
had let someone up
he wasn't supposed to.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.985
He say who?
No.

11:24.684 --> 11:28.029
But he was very upset about
it, for a few days, actually.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.263
A witness says
you let someone up

11:30.323 --> 11:32.325
to the Grimaldi place
a few weeks ago.

11:32.392 --> 11:33.928
Somebody he got
pretty upset about.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.597
I never let anybody up there.
I told him that.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.732
You think it did me any good?

11:36.796 --> 11:38.207
Well, you do know who
that person was?

11:38.264 --> 11:41.336
If it's the time I'm thinking
about, it was a process server.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.880
Grimaldi had legal problems?

11:42.936 --> 11:43.971
Thanks.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.313
I guess. This guy came
around a few times.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.283
He must've finally snuck up while
I was doing something else.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.884
You know who he worked for?

11:49.943 --> 11:53.891
All I know is Grimaldi tore me a
new one for letting the guy in.

11:54.447 --> 11:57.155
I ran Grimaldi's name through
the court's computer.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.493
There were no cases with
his name in a caption,

11:59.552 --> 12:01.498
so he isn't a plaintiff
or a defendant.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.726
The kids and the girlfriend

12:02.789 --> 12:05.065
didn't know anything
about a lawsuit either.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.230
He could have been involved in
litigation in some other way.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.967
He worked for an insurance
company, right?

12:10.029 --> 12:12.009
He's been retired
for over 10 years.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.669
MAN: Here you go.
I have an Aunt Opal.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.973
Slipped in a supermarket once.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.605
Took her 12 years
to settle her case.

12:21.341 --> 12:24.686
I was surprised when my
assistant gave me your message.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.918
Peter Grimaldi was a kind
of dinosaur around here.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.983
Worked for the company
for over 40 years.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.392
We were wondering
if he was part

12:31.451 --> 12:33.294
of any lawsuit
involving All-Atlantic.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.231
I had litigation
pull our claims.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.269
I'm afraid there's
nothing here.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.669
Which is not surprising, given
Peter sold mostly life insurance.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.799
Then he had a broker's
license, right?

12:43.896 --> 12:45.466
Of course. Why?

12:45.865 --> 12:48.675
Any chance he was still
doing business on the side?

12:49.903 --> 12:51.314
Not with us.

12:52.171 --> 12:56.017
Peter Grimaldi's license to sell
insurance lapsed 11 years ago.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.749
The last thing I see
is a letter from someone

12:58.811 --> 13:00.848
requesting a business
address for him,

13:00.980 --> 13:02.254
and that was three years ago.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.385
A letter about what?

13:03.449 --> 13:05.087
Oh, it's pretty hard to follow.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.528
She claimed this guy Grimaldi

13:06.586 --> 13:08.759
sold her family some
insurance a long time ago,

13:08.821 --> 13:10.095
then refused to pay.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.635
But you can see right there,

13:11.691 --> 13:14.331
she was talking about a guy
named Pietro Grimaldi,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.164
not Peter.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.732
Pietro is Peter in Italian.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.544
What happened to her complaint?

13:21.601 --> 13:22.773
Nothing.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.873
Like I said, we weren't
sure she had the right guy.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.146
Dora Wolkoff.
Bronx, New York.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.152
Ciao.
That means goodbye.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.059
Well, if you came to arrest
her, you're a year too late.

13:36.115 --> 13:38.061
Dora passed last December.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.858
Happens all the time
around here.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.421
Yeah, it happens
where we work, too.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.297
She ever mention any legal
problems she was having?

13:44.357 --> 13:46.098
Like what sort of problems?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.662
You know, like,
maybe insurance problems.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.730
You guys are here
about Dora's insurance?

13:50.797 --> 13:52.470
Actually, we're
investigating the death

13:52.532 --> 13:54.773
of a man named Peter Grimaldi.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.176
Pietro Grimaldi?

13:57.236 --> 13:58.579
You mean to tell me
he was a real person?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.107
What do you know about him?

14:00.173 --> 14:02.449
Dora said this Pietro Grimaldi

14:02.508 --> 14:04.146
sold her father
some life insurance.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.816
Used to say she was gonna
walk out of here a rich lady.

14:06.879 --> 14:08.415
So, he was real, huh?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.791
I guess what comes around
goes around, though.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.124
Why do you say that?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.658
Well, Dora said
this guy wouldn't pay.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.723
Said he'd done this thing
to a bunch of other people.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.564
You know,
back in the old country.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.968
ED: She ever mention
any other names?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.064
(SIGHS) I don't remember.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.802
But I bet
her daughter would know.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.003
Evie used to write letters
for them all the time.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.476
So, you guys finally
going to get him

14:29.535 --> 14:31.811
to pay the money
he owes me, or what?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.782
Pietro Grimaldi
was found murdered

14:33.840 --> 14:35.683
a few days ago, Miss Wolkoff.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.551
(LAUGHS)

14:38.544 --> 14:39.955
Was he rich?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.855
Why do you ask that?

14:41.914 --> 14:44.827
Pietro Grimaldi was an
insurance salesman, Detective.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.558
During the war, he traveled
through Poland and Czechoslovakia

14:47.620 --> 14:50.794
selling life insurance
policies to Jewish families.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.131
Told them their money
would be safe.

14:52.191 --> 14:56.435
Said he worked for an Italian
company, Federali Insurance.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.476
Isn't that right, Hymie?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.306
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

15:00.366 --> 15:03.108
He sold a policy to
Mr. Radzanower's family, too.

15:03.169 --> 15:04.910
And there's others.

15:05.204 --> 15:08.208
Then the war ends,
he refused to pay.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.955
Pietro Grimaldi took my
grandfather's last dollar

15:13.546 --> 15:15.890
and left my mother
with nothing.

15:16.449 --> 15:20.829
Wolkoff, Radzanower,
Getzler, Ribet, Frank.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.735
All Holocaust survivors or the
families of Holocaust victims

15:24.791 --> 15:28.364
who purchased life insurance
policies from Pietro Grimaldi.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.532
All of them stiffed by him.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.742
And all with a motive
to kill him.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.035
How many?

15:35.101 --> 15:36.944
VAN BUREN: Daughter
gave us 59 names.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.983
But she says
there could be thousands.

15:39.038 --> 15:42.952
Apparently Grimaldi used the
Nazis as a marketing tool,

15:43.309 --> 15:46.051
while figuring he'd never have
to pay off on the policies.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.149
I have an appointment
with the Italian Consulate.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.854
We'll see what they know
about Federali Insurance.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.494
Just when you thought that
there weren't any more ways

15:53.553 --> 15:56.659
to violate these people,
an insurance scam.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.167
The Italian government
subpoenaed Grimaldi.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.505
We recently started an
investigation into allegations

16:05.565 --> 16:07.806
that certain Italian
insurance companies

16:07.867 --> 16:12.111
sold life insurance policies to
Jewish families in Eastern Europe

16:12.171 --> 16:14.879
during the war and
then refused to pay.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.079
Refused why?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.982
The companies claim there
is no documentation

16:18.044 --> 16:19.887
the policies were ever issued.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.085
And now most of these
companies don't even exist.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.958
What about the company
Grimaldi worked for in Italy,

16:25.017 --> 16:26.087
Federali Insurance?

16:26.152 --> 16:27.324
Bankrupt.

16:27.386 --> 16:30.731
We traced over 1,100 policies
to Federali Insurance.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.460
But without Peter
Grimaldi's testimony,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.836
I'm afraid the truth
may never be known.

16:35.895 --> 16:36.999
Sounds like
a pretty good motive

16:37.063 --> 16:38.736
to make sure he didn't testify.

16:38.798 --> 16:39.868
Yes.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.503
Could I get copies of
your files on Federali?

16:42.568 --> 16:45.742
I'd like for one of our forensic
accountants to examine them.

16:47.206 --> 16:49.516
Aren't we just a little
out of our jurisdiction?

16:49.609 --> 16:50.952
Maybe not.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.348
When Federali Insurance
filed for bankruptcy,

16:54.413 --> 16:55.983
they listed their
outstanding policies.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.156
Anyone from
Evelyn Wolkoff's list?

16:59.218 --> 17:02.961
No. But there were several
American policy holders.

17:05.023 --> 17:08.233
Who goes to Italy to buy
life insurance during a war?

17:08.394 --> 17:09.599
No one.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.642
The policies were purchased
at a brokerage here

17:11.696 --> 17:13.108
in New York.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.044
A brokerage in New York
sold Federali's policies?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.680
Guess who owned the brokerage.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.416
All-Atlantic.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.914
Because guess
who owned Federali.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.060
All-Atlantic.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.027
I believe I've already
told your two detectives

17:33.085 --> 17:35.725
everything we knew
about Mr. Grimaldi.

17:36.155 --> 17:38.032
Strange you never
mentioned the fact

17:38.090 --> 17:40.036
All-Atlantic owned
the Italian company

17:40.092 --> 17:42.163
Grimaldi worked for
during the war.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.071
I don't see how
that's relevant.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.440
As a subsidiary,
All-Atlantic is liable

17:46.499 --> 17:48.604
for any policy
written by Federali.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.075
JACK: You see the relevance
now, Mr. Bresler?

17:51.237 --> 17:54.116
STEWART: We have never
hidden from our obligations.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.177
If you have any
specific policy numbers,

17:57.243 --> 17:59.519
we'd be happy
to check our records.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.453
I think you know we don't.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.828
We're wondering
if Grimaldi did.

18:03.983 --> 18:10.093
Look, it's possible
life insurance was sold

18:10.156 --> 18:13.501
to someone who became
a victim of the war.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.396
But as chairman
of this company,

18:15.461 --> 18:18.237
I can assure you we have
absolutely no knowledge

18:18.297 --> 18:20.504
of any such policy.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.744
Were you aware that
the Italian government

18:23.269 --> 18:26.409
had just subpoenaed Peter Grimaldi
shortly before he was killed?

18:26.472 --> 18:27.974
STEWART: Pure politics.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.348
We went after their banks.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.012
Now they'd like a go at us.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.056
SO YOU were aware.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.989
I don't think Mr. Stewart
meant to imply

18:35.047 --> 18:38.187
that he had any specific
knowledge of the subpoena.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.663
Only that he was aware
of their investigation.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.593
Exactly so.

18:42.655 --> 18:47.934
Look, I sympathize with the
frustration of someone

18:47.994 --> 18:50.838
who believes that he was
cheated by circumstance,

18:50.897 --> 18:55.607
but I can't just turn this
company into a deep pocket.

18:55.668 --> 19:00.117
We are required to verify a policy's
existence before we can pay.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.482
And unfortunately,
most of Federali's files

19:02.541 --> 19:05.181
disappeared when the
countries they were kept in

19:05.244 --> 19:07.246
were taken over
by the communists.

19:07.313 --> 19:11.352
So, at this point, it would be
totally irresponsible of us to pay.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.963
You think the company my father
worked for is behind his murder?

19:18.257 --> 19:21.670
JACK: Just before his death, your father
was subpoenaed by the Italian government

19:21.727 --> 19:26.233
to give testimony about certain insurance
policies he sold during the war.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.474
Testimony that might have cost

19:28.534 --> 19:31.481
All-Atlantic hundreds
of millions of dollars.

19:32.471 --> 19:33.848
Did your father ever tell you

19:33.906 --> 19:35.943
about his work during the war?

19:36.142 --> 19:38.713
Just that he was
an insurance salesman.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.884
But did he ever tell you
who he sold insurance to

19:41.948 --> 19:44.326
or how he came to work
for All-Atlantic?

19:44.383 --> 19:47.728
What are you saying? Who did
my father sell insurance to?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.799
Holocaust victims.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.502
He kept a book.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.867
DONNA: Jordan?

20:02.068 --> 20:05.538
It was about 10 years ago, when
he retired, he showed it to me.

20:05.605 --> 20:08.711
It had names, dates,
different numbers.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.782
It was in my father's
handwriting.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.948
Why didn't you ever tell me?

20:13.012 --> 20:15.219
JACK: Why did
he show it to you?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.851
He said it might be worth
a lot of money one day,

20:17.917 --> 20:20.989
and he wanted me to know
about it, that's all.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.330
It wasn't something I really
wanted to think about.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.293
Do you know what
happened to that book?

20:27.560 --> 20:28.664
No.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.036
It seems Grimaldi kept
a handwritten record

20:34.100 --> 20:36.637
of the policies he sold
in Eastern Europe. A book.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.012
We had the police search his apartment.
Nothing came up.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.712
His son says Grimaldi showed him
the book about 10 years ago.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.449
The same time he opened
the deposit box.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.885
Who told Roland Dell
it was there?

20:47.947 --> 20:49.949
Dell's not talking to us.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.821
Find out who talked to him.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.665
Briscoe's report says
Dell claimed

20:57.723 --> 20:59.430
he had a job working
for his brother-in-law.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.835
Doing what?

21:00.893 --> 21:03.840
Brother-in-law's working for a
company called Burton Security.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.032
His parole officer said
you got him a job.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.670
I never spoke
with his parole officer.

21:09.735 --> 21:12.181
Your brother-in-law's facing
a murder charge, Mr. Hollis.

21:12.238 --> 21:13.410
If you know something
about that,

21:13.472 --> 21:16.885
you could easily find yourself
facing charges as well.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.446
I passed his name along. To who?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.617
Donald Burton.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.057
The owner?

21:23.549 --> 21:24.789
What sort of company is this?

21:24.850 --> 21:27.194
We supply security
to businesses.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.563
So why pass
Roland's name along?

21:29.855 --> 21:31.425
A few weeks back,
Burton comes to me,

21:31.490 --> 21:33.697
says he needs somebody
with street smarts.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.296
Somebody who can
keep his mouth shut.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.575
Knows all about Roland.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.609
Look, I got a family to feed,

21:41.667 --> 21:45.114
but I didn't know he was going
to rob nobody, I swear.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.742
Man gave me a job, so what?

21:49.375 --> 21:52.219
It's a race to the
D.A.'s office, Mr. Dell.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.519
The one who flips fastest wins.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.221
How long do you think
it's going to be

21:56.282 --> 22:00.128
before Donald Burton tells us you
robbed that guy on your own?

22:04.557 --> 22:07.060
So what happens if he tells
you what you want to know?

22:07.126 --> 22:10.107
I'm prepared to offer 10
years on the homicide.

22:10.563 --> 22:13.635
I'll also recommend his
outstanding parole violation

22:13.699 --> 22:14.973
run concurrent
with that sentence.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.240
That's three years for free.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.819
Yeah, all right.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.779
Um...

22:28.948 --> 22:31.952
I met up with
Reggie's boss, Burton,

22:32.351 --> 22:36.094
and he tells me he wants
me to rob this old man.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.869
Gives me the 411 on the
when and the where.

22:40.459 --> 22:42.200
How about the what?

22:42.928 --> 22:46.273
I was just supposed to take
a book, that's all I know.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.970
So why'd you stab him?

22:48.400 --> 22:51.210
Man, once I snatched
the case, the old man,

22:51.270 --> 22:53.250
he grabs my jacket,
he won't let go,

22:53.305 --> 22:55.285
so I did what I needed to.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.514
Who shot him?

22:57.643 --> 22:59.122
Who shot who?

22:59.478 --> 23:01.924
CARMICHAEL: The man you
stabbed was also shot.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.085
What?

23:03.215 --> 23:05.491
I might make that
parole recommendation

23:05.551 --> 23:08.122
with a little more enthusiasm
if I knew the truth.

23:08.187 --> 23:12.499
Look, I don't know nothing about him
being shot, and that is the truth.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.162
Ask Burton if
you don't believe me.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.331
He was there, too.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.739
He was watching
the whole thing.

23:18.998 --> 23:22.309
Look, so I hire a couple of
questionable characters once in awhile.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.506
Big deal.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.980
You want to walk
around a warehouse

23:25.037 --> 23:26.948
in the South Bronx
at 3:00 a.m.?

23:27.006 --> 23:29.145
We're not talking about the
South Bronx, Mr. Burton.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.313
We're talking about
midtown Manhattan.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.550
Roland Dell gave
a full statement.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.319
We've also subpoenaed
your bank records,

23:35.381 --> 23:38.851
so we know you've done work
for All-Atlantic Insurance.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.695
JACK: What about it,
Mr. Burton?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.131
Oh, my God.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.661
What's on the table?

23:46.058 --> 23:48.038
JACK: Ten years.
Same as Dell.

23:48.694 --> 23:49.832
GARCIA: No.

23:50.529 --> 23:53.100
He gave you us,
we can give you more.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.510
More to give, more to get.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.047
What'd you have
in mind, Counselor?

23:58.804 --> 23:59.874
Five.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.714
I'll consider seven.

24:07.880 --> 24:11.089
Alan Bresler,
from All-Atlantic Insurance,

24:11.150 --> 24:13.892
he called me and told me
he had a security problem.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.591
Security problem?

24:16.255 --> 24:18.963
He's a lawyer.
That's the way he put it.

24:19.792 --> 24:22.739
Said this guy Grimaldi
used to work for them.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.942
Told me he had a book with
a list of policy numbers.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.067
He tried to sell it to them,

24:28.133 --> 24:30.545
but Hamilton Stewart
wouldn't buy.

24:32.938 --> 24:34.076
Where's the book now?

24:34.139 --> 24:35.948
I gave the briefcase
to Bresler.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.179
Who was the shooter?

24:38.510 --> 24:40.114
You telling me
Grimaldi was shot?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.385
There's the autopsy report.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.323
Wait.

24:48.687 --> 24:50.394
It had to be.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.730
Had to be what?

24:52.591 --> 24:54.935
I was sitting on the
bank across the street.

24:54.993 --> 24:58.031
When Grimaldi came out,
I gave Dell the signal.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.838
Only soon as I did,

25:00.065 --> 25:02.306
Grimaldi starts up a
conversation with this guy.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.574
Describe him.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.141
Uh, white.
Six foot.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.318
Thirty-five, forty.
Black hair.

25:12.044 --> 25:13.250
What else did you see?

25:13.612 --> 25:15.592
Looked like they were arguing.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.889
That's when he
must have shot him.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.191
And then the old man walks away

25:20.252 --> 25:22.095
and Dell does his thing.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.836
We believe him?
Doesn't make sense,

25:26.892 --> 25:28.735
he wouldn't give up the shooter.
(DOOR OPENS)

25:28.794 --> 25:30.740
Ballistics report on Grimaldi.

25:30.796 --> 25:33.902
The bullet was a 9 mm
manufactured in Italy.

25:33.966 --> 25:38.642
FBI lab determined it was fired
from a 1934 Italian GAR.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.377
Family heirloom.

25:40.439 --> 25:42.919
Grimaldi's son
registered a '34 GAR

25:42.975 --> 25:45.353
in Pennsylvania, 15 years ago.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.483
Is your brother here?

25:50.549 --> 25:51.789
Jordan.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.594
Jordan Grimaldi,
you're under arrest

25:54.653 --> 25:56.098
for the murder
of Peter Grimaldi.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.361
Jordan, what's going on?

25:57.423 --> 25:59.027
Put your hands
behind your back.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.434
DONNA: Jordan?

26:00.492 --> 26:02.335
Oh, my God, no!
What's going on?

26:02.394 --> 26:05.068
It's okay. It's okay, Donna.
It's gonna be all right.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.972
Burton told us Grimaldi
tried to sell the book.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.277
Maybe his son thought he
could cut a better deal.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.354
Why tell us about the
book in the first place?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.116
It doesn't matter.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.018
We still have two homicides

26:21.080 --> 26:22.991
and one body to go around.

26:23.048 --> 26:25.119
The problem is, if we go after
the son for the murder,

26:25.184 --> 26:28.461
we just about guarantee reasonable
doubt for Bresler and Stewart.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.765
We go after those two,
the boy gets a walk.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.503
There's a third option.

26:35.894 --> 26:38.135
Go after the son for the murder

26:39.097 --> 26:42.078
and Bresler and Stewart
for grand larceny.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.078
Since when did you become
a defense attorney?

26:45.137 --> 26:47.777
Grimaldi was robbed
to prevent those people

26:47.840 --> 26:50.013
from collecting
on their insurance policies.

26:51.143 --> 26:54.147
Every policy would
constitute a separate count.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.117
How many counts
we talking about?

26:56.181 --> 26:58.127
Over a thousand.
That we know of.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.688
They'll need a calculator or two
to figure out the sentence.

27:07.493 --> 27:09.234
Your Honor, People are
amending their complaint,

27:09.294 --> 27:10.602
dismissing the homicide counts

27:10.662 --> 27:12.369
and adding the charge
of Grand Larceny.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.869
1,136 counts. Is that number
correct, Miss Carmichael?

27:17.136 --> 27:19.377
As per the Italian Consulate,
it is, Your Honor.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.315
Theft of insurance
policy numbers?

27:21.373 --> 27:25.082
Judge, those policies were
sold more than 50 years ago.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.312
Peter Grimaldi's
robbery and murder

27:27.379 --> 27:29.222
takes care of the
statute of limitations.

27:29.281 --> 27:33.354
I agree. But I won't remand these
defendants on a larceny charge.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.558
Bail is set at 100,000 each.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.827
(GAVEL POUNDS)

27:38.957 --> 27:41.528
Figured you might
pull a stunt like this.

27:41.593 --> 27:42.697
Motion to dismiss.

27:42.761 --> 27:44.331
Without the book,
you've got nothing.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.602
"Jordan Grimaldi."

27:45.664 --> 27:47.837
Defendant is charged
with first degree murder.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.902
Except for him, of course.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.848
Mr. Gold is right.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.682
Without the book, you
have no proof sufficient

27:56.742 --> 27:57.743
for a conviction.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.482
But we do for an
indictment, Your Honor.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.025
It's an exercise in
futility, Your Honor.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.082
They can't produce that book.

28:04.149 --> 28:06.891
Do you know something
we don't, Mr. Gold?

28:07.152 --> 28:09.359
I'll let the trial
go forward, Mr. McCoy.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.233
But you better have the goods at
the end of the People's case.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.233
(SIGHS)

28:16.295 --> 28:18.741
If they're smart, the book's
already in the shredder.

28:18.797 --> 28:21.710
Maybe. But we still have
the next best thing.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.278
Was it the money,
Mr. Grimaldi?

28:31.743 --> 28:33.051
Is that why
you killed your father?

28:33.112 --> 28:35.752
Haven't you done enough
to my brother?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.588
JACK: I think
your brother

28:38.383 --> 28:42.661
was in serious trouble
long before we got there.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.333
What do you know about me?
Jordan, don't talk.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.337
I never wanted the money.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.566
That was blood money.

28:50.629 --> 28:53.701
Then why didn't you tell
someone about the book?

28:57.970 --> 29:00.075
It must have been difficult
learning about your father.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.848
You don't have to answer.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.383
I think he does, Counselor.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.513
I think he needs to answer.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.217
My father was responsible
for his own death.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.885
Jordan, please listen
to the lawyer.

29:10.949 --> 29:12.428
They can't prove anything.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.725
You're the only one,
other than your father,

29:14.786 --> 29:16.925
that's ever seen
what's inside that book.

29:18.523 --> 29:21.470
Without your testimony,
these men will walk.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.664
If that happens, I promise,

29:23.762 --> 29:26.606
your brother will do enough
time for all of them.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.110
What's your offer?

29:29.034 --> 29:31.913
Nothing.
Until he takes the stand.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.875
Afterwards, I'll be
willing to listen.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.278
You're asking him to testify
without a plea bargain?

29:38.343 --> 29:40.550
I won't inquire
about the shooting.

29:40.612 --> 29:43.923
If the defense does, he can
take the Fifth Amendment.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.728
I'm offering you the chance

29:47.786 --> 29:50.392
to do what you failed
to do that day.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.732
JACK: You're originally
from Poland,

29:58.797 --> 30:00.777
is that right,
Mr. Radzanower?

30:00.832 --> 30:03.108
From Budzanov.
A little town.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.842
And you knew a man
named Pietro Grimaldi?

30:05.904 --> 30:07.406
I knew him, yes.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.713
Tell us how, if you would, sir.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.087
It was 1939.

30:13.979 --> 30:17.722
The last time we were
all together as a family.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.057
The Germans just moved
into Poland,

30:23.956 --> 30:27.403
and things became
very difficult.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.971
Difficult?
For the Jews.

30:30.896 --> 30:34.241
My father owned
a small trucking company.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.404
He came to work one day

30:37.235 --> 30:40.273
to find all his trucks burned

30:40.339 --> 30:43.616
and the windows
of our garage broken.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.224
Unfortunately,
most of the Poles

30:48.280 --> 30:52.353
didn't need much
encouragement to hate us.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.696
That night, Grimaldi showed up.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.969
And he talked to your father?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.868
He told my father

31:02.728 --> 31:05.504
the Jews are being killed
in Germany.

31:06.298 --> 31:09.677
It's just a matter of time
for all of us.

31:10.402 --> 31:14.316
Then he showed
my father a picture

31:14.740 --> 31:19.621
of women and children
in a ditch, shot.

31:21.146 --> 31:27.188
Then he offered to sell
my father insurance.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.123
Of course, he bought.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.135
JACK: And you're sure
this was Pietro Grimaldi?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.967
My father made us
memorize Grimaldi's name,

31:37.462 --> 31:39.408
and he told us where to go

31:39.798 --> 31:42.335
if something should happen.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.906
And what happened to your
family, Mr. Radzanower?

31:46.271 --> 31:47.875
Hitler happened.

31:51.977 --> 31:54.150
And when it was over,

31:55.113 --> 31:57.957
I could only find my sister.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.057
She was very sick.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.466
I was 17, and we were alone.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.306
JACK:
And what did you do?

32:12.397 --> 32:15.469
We walked.
Over a year.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.009
I carried her most of the time.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.008
To Italy.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.747
To where my father told me
Grimaldi should be.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.783
And did you find him?

32:25.844 --> 32:28.586
Yes. I asked him
for our money.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.594
I told him without it
my sister would die.

32:31.850 --> 32:33.124
And what did he say?

32:33.185 --> 32:35.961
He said he doesn't
remember my father.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.559
He has no record of any policy.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.770
And without
a death certificate,

32:43.829 --> 32:47.242
I don't have even proof
that my father is dead.

32:49.901 --> 32:53.747
The Nazis did not give
any death certificates.

32:55.107 --> 32:59.146
I have only one from Italy.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.848
For my sister.

33:09.287 --> 33:11.198
I have nothing further.

33:16.027 --> 33:17.563
(CLEARING THROAT)

33:17.929 --> 33:19.966
Prior to this trial, sir,

33:20.031 --> 33:23.740
had you ever heard of the
All-Atlantic Insurance Company?

33:23.802 --> 33:24.872
No.

33:24.936 --> 33:28.474
Then your father did not buy
a policy from them, did he?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.619
He bought from Federali.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.120
So you would not
have made a claim

33:32.177 --> 33:34.248
against the All-Atlantic
Insurance Company,

33:34.312 --> 33:35.848
because you had
no basis to believe

33:35.914 --> 33:37.655
that they owed you any
money, is that right?

33:37.716 --> 33:38.751
Objection.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.854
The question calls for
a legal conclusion.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.092
Judge, it is
the People's theory

33:43.155 --> 33:44.793
that my clients stole a book

33:44.856 --> 33:47.962
to prevent this man and others like
him from claiming their insurance.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.471
I'd like a chance
to find out whether

33:49.528 --> 33:53.066
he thinks my clients owed him
any money in the first place.

33:53.131 --> 33:56.578
Do you think these men owe you
anything, Mr. Radzanower?

33:56.902 --> 34:01.647
I think these men
should close their eyes

34:02.207 --> 34:03.982
and see my sister.

34:04.509 --> 34:08.581
See my sister as a little
girl she was once,

34:08.647 --> 34:10.991
and a woman
she should have been.

34:12.083 --> 34:15.826
Then I want them
to open their eyes

34:16.087 --> 34:20.866
and tell me if they think
they owe me anything.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.135
My father showed me a book.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.609
He told me he'd kept a record
of all the insurance policies

34:30.668 --> 34:34.242
he sold during the war, so he wouldn't
be cheated out of his commissions.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.909
What sort of a record was this?

34:35.974 --> 34:39.148
Names, dates,
policy numbers, places.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.255
What places?

34:42.581 --> 34:46.290
Warsaw, Lodz, Vienna, Prague.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.790
How many policies were there?

34:49.286 --> 34:51.927
Maybe a thousand.
Maybe more.

34:55.659 --> 34:57.298
Nothing further.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.844
You didn't have a very good
relationship with your father,

35:02.901 --> 35:04.778
did you, Mr. Grimaldi?

35:04.836 --> 35:05.906
No.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.644
In fact, you hated the man.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.482
I loved my father.
I hated what he'd done.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.453
You mean, like,
selling those policies.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.354
And having kept
them secret, yes.

35:14.412 --> 35:15.584
I see.

35:16.581 --> 35:20.791
Well, tell us, when did you
find out about the book?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.364
About 10 years ago.

35:23.421 --> 35:24.695
Ten years?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.736
Tell anybody,
Mr. Grimaldi?

35:29.027 --> 35:30.097
No.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.437
Like father, like son.
Objection.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.104
Isn't it a fact that he only
reason you're coming forward now

35:36.167 --> 35:38.169
with this fiction about a book

35:38.236 --> 35:40.045
is that you were offered
a plea bargain?

35:40.238 --> 35:42.343
A plea bargain for the
murder of your own father.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.442
Objection.

35:43.508 --> 35:44.919
I wasn't offered
a plea bargain.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.216
JUDGE: Sustained.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.882
Did you murder your father?

35:48.113 --> 35:50.491
Mr. Grimaldi,
I have to warn you,

35:50.849 --> 35:53.022
you have the right not to answer
under the Fifth Amendment.

35:53.084 --> 35:54.995
Judge, let me talk
to my client.

35:55.053 --> 35:57.431
I don't need
to talk to my lawyer.

35:57.489 --> 36:00.265
The record reflects
counsel refused.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.108
I shot him.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.271
GOLD: And the whole thing about
this book was a scam, wasn't it?

36:11.336 --> 36:12.440
JORDAN: No.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.950
A scam to save your father,
and now to save you.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.849
That is a lie.
GOLD: There never was a book.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.286
There was.
There was a book.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.086
And you're right.

36:25.784 --> 36:28.162
I should have said
something a long time ago.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.756
GOLD: But you didn't,
did you?

36:32.357 --> 36:35.634
When he told me,
told me what it was,

36:37.028 --> 36:39.099
I begged him to turn it in.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.812
But he wouldn't listen.

36:44.336 --> 36:46.009
My father never listened.

36:46.071 --> 36:48.881
GOLD: So it's only now, when
you're facing a murder charge

36:48.940 --> 36:51.147
that you decide to come
forward, is that it?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.688
My father called me
a few weeks ago

36:52.744 --> 36:54.883
and told me he'd
been subpoenaed.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.254
He wanted to make sure
I didn't say anything

36:56.314 --> 36:58.351
to anybody about the book.

36:58.416 --> 37:00.191
He told me he was
going to sell it.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.356
To them.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.421
He even offered me money.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.690
For my children, he said.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.633
Object as non-responsive.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.102
Overruled.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.270
You can finish
your answer, sir.

37:13.965 --> 37:16.241
When he came out of the bank,
I was waiting for him.

37:16.301 --> 37:17.803
I had the gun.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.279
But I had to stop him.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.250
When he saw it,
he became enraged.

37:23.308 --> 37:24.981
He reached for it.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.189
It went off.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.191
He just looked at me

37:35.854 --> 37:37.800
and then he walked away.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.300
If my father had sold that book

37:43.361 --> 37:45.807
and I had done nothing
to stop him,

37:47.866 --> 37:50.107
I would have been lost forever.

37:56.374 --> 37:59.480
Even I have to admit it's
pretty hard to blame him.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.486
Even harder to figure
how to punish him.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.219
Can I talk to you?

38:05.517 --> 38:07.929
You shouldn't do that without
your lawyer, Mr. Bresler.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.260
I am a lawyer,
Mr. McCoy.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.027
I know what I'm doing.

38:11.089 --> 38:13.569
You won't be able to
change your mind.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.105
I just watched someone's
son ruin his life

38:16.161 --> 38:18.698
over the shame
of his father's acts.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.141
I have a son myself.

38:23.902 --> 38:26.439
BRESLER: I'd found out
what we'd done in '92.

38:27.305 --> 38:28.909
Hamilton Stewart
had been the Director

38:28.973 --> 38:32.386
of All-Atlantic's European
Operations during the war.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.723
He'd just read something
about a Jewish family

38:34.779 --> 38:37.282
suing a Swiss bank
and its director.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.457
He was afraid something like
that could happen to us.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.930
He wanted to know
what our liability was.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.763
You mean, his liability.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.961
Yes.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.196
What did you tell him?

38:48.393 --> 38:51.704
That both he and the company
had considerable exposure.

38:52.464 --> 38:55.138
If those policies could
ever be proven to exist.

38:56.234 --> 38:57.770
ARTHUR: Enter the book.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.340
When Peter got the subpoena,
he called Stewart.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.578
Told him he was going to turn
the book over to the Italians

39:03.641 --> 39:05.018
unless he was paid $2 million.

39:05.710 --> 39:06.814
Why not pay?

39:07.746 --> 39:10.625
There's no way to hide
a payment like that.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.790
That's when the decision was
made to obtain the book.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.731
You mean, to steal it.

39:18.089 --> 39:21.298
I was told to tell Peter
we had the money,

39:21.359 --> 39:23.134
and that he should bring
the book to my office.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.668
Burton would be waiting for him
when he came out of the bank.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.874
Where's the book now?

39:32.771 --> 39:36.685
Burton gave it to me and I
gave it to Hamilton Stewart.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.284
I know what I did
was a terrible thing.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.193
Your day of reckoning
isn't today.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.222
Put Stewart in jail.

39:52.924 --> 39:56.030
At no time did
lever order anyone

39:56.094 --> 39:59.405
to participate in a robbery,

40:00.832 --> 40:04.177
nor did I ever try
to purchase any book.

40:04.369 --> 40:07.213
And the testimony we heard from
Alan Bresler that you did?

40:07.272 --> 40:09.445
STEWART:
Complete fabrication.

40:09.674 --> 40:13.281
GOLD: So, you also deny any
effort by you or your company

40:13.344 --> 40:15.221
to prevent Holocaust victims

40:15.280 --> 40:18.523
from collecting on their
legitimate insurance policies?

40:18.583 --> 40:22.463
Of course I do. Our hearts
go out to any victim of war.

40:22.520 --> 40:26.991
But All-Atlantic is
a publicly traded company,

40:27.458 --> 40:31.235
and as such it has an
obligation to its shareholders.

40:31.296 --> 40:36.143
I simply can't turn it into
a charity when it suits us.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.639
Thank you, sir.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.951
Did your hearts also
go out to them

40:47.479 --> 40:50.585
when your subsidiary was
selling them life insurance,

40:51.116 --> 40:53.255
knowing they had no chance
of ever collecting?

40:54.686 --> 40:55.926
That was never done.

40:56.754 --> 40:58.131
Wasn't it?

40:58.990 --> 41:01.903
In 1932, Federali
Insurance was writing

41:01.960 --> 41:05.100
about a million dollars
a year in life insurance.

41:05.163 --> 41:09.873
By 1942, that number
increased 10 times over.

41:11.035 --> 41:13.345
How do you suppose that
happened, Mr. Stewart?

41:13.404 --> 41:15.509
You're talking about
a long time ago.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.849
Don't tell us you've
forgotten the details

41:17.909 --> 41:20.856
that made your career
at All-Atlantic.

41:22.247 --> 41:24.056
You were able to
sell those policies

41:24.215 --> 41:26.821
because of the persecution of Jewish families.
Isn't that what happened?

41:26.885 --> 41:28.626
I didn't know anything
about that.

41:28.686 --> 41:30.256
Didn't know?

41:33.925 --> 41:35.370
You were
All-Atlantic's Director

41:35.426 --> 41:38.839
for Eastern European Operations
in 1938, weren't you?

41:38.896 --> 41:40.341
Yes.
And Federali

41:40.431 --> 41:43.469
and its salesmen were reporting
directly to you, weren't they?

41:43.535 --> 41:45.776
There were rumors, that's all.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.212
Unsubstantiated rumors.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.411
The numbers don't lie,
Mr. Stewart.

41:50.475 --> 41:53.615
Are you telling us that
you suspected nothing?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.954
You make it sound like
we were the only ones.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.357
We weren't.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.326
American car companies,

41:59.384 --> 42:00.590
banks,

42:01.419 --> 42:03.023
airplane manufacturers.

42:03.087 --> 42:05.761
We were all doing business
with Germany.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.101
My God, our own
State Department

42:09.160 --> 42:11.470
refused entry to these people

42:11.529 --> 42:14.806
based on the same
information we had.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.675
It was just business.

42:16.734 --> 42:19.010
Yes. Good business.

42:20.338 --> 42:23.148
So good, you rewarded
Peter Grimaldi

42:23.241 --> 42:24.720
with a job
at the parent company

42:24.776 --> 42:26.517
the minute he stepped
off the boat, didn't you?

42:26.578 --> 42:29.422
Peter had produced
for us in Europe.

42:34.218 --> 42:37.825
Pretty risky proposition
for an insurance company

42:37.889 --> 42:41.632
to sell life insurance during
wartime, isn't it, Mr. Stewart?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.332
I suppose.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.466
Because war raises the risk
of death, isn't that right?

42:46.531 --> 42:47.601
Yes.

42:48.032 --> 42:51.343
And death is certainly
not good business

42:51.402 --> 42:52.904
for a life insurance
company, is it?

42:52.970 --> 42:53.971
No.

42:54.038 --> 42:57.576
But All-Atlantic couldn't sell
policies fast enough, could it?

42:57.642 --> 43:00.282
Because you knew the
people you were selling to

43:00.344 --> 43:02.790
had no hope of ever collecting.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.849
No hope of ever presenting
a death certificate.

43:04.916 --> 43:05.951
Objection.

43:06.017 --> 43:07.155
Maybe they should have brought

43:07.218 --> 43:09.494
their parents' ashes
in a bag to you.

43:09.554 --> 43:10.897
Mr. McCoy.

43:11.022 --> 43:15.334
Millions of dollars being made
in the sale of life insurance,

43:15.393 --> 43:18.340
and yet, after over 50 years,

43:18.396 --> 43:20.672
not a single policy ever paid.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.144
What do you suppose happened

43:26.204 --> 43:28.582
to all those people,
Mr. Stewart?

43:29.040 --> 43:30.644
I have no idea.

43:31.376 --> 43:33.652
Don't tell us you didn't know.

43:34.679 --> 43:37.592
The fact of the matter is,
you counted on it.

43:49.527 --> 43:51.404
The book for probation.

43:53.298 --> 43:54.971
That's your proposition?

43:55.032 --> 43:56.511
STEWART: Did you know
that Federali

43:56.567 --> 43:59.514
was originally founded
by a Jewish family?

43:59.570 --> 44:01.572
They were doing it
to their own people.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.779
Mr. McCoy, that book can ease
a lot of financial pain.

44:05.043 --> 44:07.887
I won't let your client
use his company's money

44:07.945 --> 44:10.084
to pay his debt to society.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.322
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
a closing argument to write.

44:17.555 --> 44:19.364
What can I get for the book?

44:20.091 --> 44:21.468
Four to twelve.

44:27.532 --> 44:30.172
And I want a written
agreement waiving your right

44:30.234 --> 44:33.340
to contest extradition to
Italy if they want you there.

44:42.747 --> 44:47.059
JACK: Turned out to be the
only bargaining chip they had.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.929
Insurance for
the insurance men.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.429
Still, it's scary to think
that without that book,

44:54.492 --> 44:57.405
they could have claimed
none of it was real.

44:58.463 --> 45:01.034
It wasn't the book
that made it real.
