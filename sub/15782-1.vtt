Actually, that's Quenya --
high-Elven,

26:33.132 --> 26:35.051
very
similar to Sindarin.

26:35.134 --> 26:37.595
Yeah, I left my English-to-Geek
dictionary in my room.

26:37.678 --> 26:39.097
BOTH:
"Lord of the Rings"!

26:39.180 --> 26:40.723
What do they want --
higher pay?

26:40.807 --> 26:42.600
They want, and I quote,

26:42.683 --> 26:44.435
"the sun to rise
on the children of Palaemon

26:44.519 --> 26:47.021
with rays of global dominion."

26:47.105 --> 26:50.024
That's not happening.
Let's cut these and get <i>my</i> ray shield.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.068
Rust, that facility
is a fully contaminated

26:52.151 --> 26:54.028
mutant incubator!

26:54.112 --> 26:55.780
We can't go in there
unless we decon.

26:55.863 --> 26:57.240
And that's not gonna be easy.

26:57.323 --> 27:00.201
Well, my brother is gonna
be here in... 24 hours!

27:00.284 --> 27:02.286
All my houseboys and Hatred
have disappeared,

27:02.370 --> 27:04.539
and I'm left with the B-team!

27:04.622 --> 27:06.874
B-team?!
All right, listen up!

27:06.958 --> 27:09.460
As new S.P.H.l.N.X. Commander,
I'm taking over this mission!

27:09.544 --> 27:12.421
Blondie, Shorty, get to work
on decontamination.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.507
Lurch and Boy-Band, report
anything strange back to me.

27:14.590 --> 27:16.217
- Check!
- Hey, cool.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.928
Papa V., you find a way
to reverse the mutations.

27:19.011 --> 27:21.389
I'm gonna work on deciphering
this list of demands.

27:21.472 --> 27:24.767
We have 24 hours to deliver
a ray shield, people!

27:24.851 --> 27:27.270
Let's bring this baby home!

27:27.353 --> 27:29.355
[ whip cracks ]
HATRED: Aah!

27:29.438 --> 27:32.233
[ whip cracks ]
- Gahh!

27:32.316 --> 27:34.694
What is your name,
Outlander?

27:34.777 --> 27:35.987
Eat me!

27:36.070 --> 27:38.322
Hey, don't tempt me,
delicious!

27:38.406 --> 27:40.366
- Yoww!
- What is your name?

27:40.449 --> 27:42.368
Hatred!
I'm Sergeant Hatred!

27:42.451 --> 27:45.913
That is your slave name!
What is your name?

27:45.997 --> 27:48.708
Yaaagh!
My name is Sergeant Hatred!

27:48.791 --> 27:51.169
That is not what it says
on your driver's license, dude!

27:51.252 --> 27:53.254
Your masters have stripped you
of your blue robes.

27:53.337 --> 27:55.298
Your body is changing,
just as ours.

27:55.381 --> 27:57.800
Join us, or we're gonna
straight-up eat you, son!

27:57.884 --> 27:58.968
No lies!

27:59.051 --> 28:00.595
- [groans]
- THALIA: Hey! Martin!

28:00.678 --> 28:02.597
I-I changed my mind,
I want to go.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.348
Thalia! What have you done?!

28:04.432 --> 28:06.684
This is Dean,
of the Venture clan.

28:06.767 --> 28:08.102
He has come for challenge.

28:08.186 --> 28:09.937
Yo, did you not read
the rules I wrote?

28:10.021 --> 28:11.606
He's an outsider.
It's forbidden.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.399
Outsider?!
You're the outsider.

28:13.482 --> 28:16.235
Before you guys made this
into E-Wok village or whatever,

28:16.319 --> 28:17.987
it was just a part
of my yard.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.448
[thinking] Hey, bro.
Can you speak in silent tongue?

28:20.531 --> 28:23.159
If he punches me,
I might poop myself a little.

28:23.242 --> 28:24.452
I can feel some poop coming.

28:24.535 --> 28:26.204
Oh, don't do that.
He's really bad at that.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.330
Yeah, no kiddin'.

28:27.413 --> 28:29.832
Well, if he won't accept
the challenge and pusses out,

28:29.916 --> 28:31.167
then I guess I should
just go.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.628
Puss out?! No, no.
I accept challenge.

28:33.711 --> 28:37.882
And, as my Cha-nira,
I'm goin' with my main man, Matt!

28:37.965 --> 28:39.508
You must choose now.

28:39.592 --> 28:41.260
Um... as my...

28:41.344 --> 28:43.679
whatever he just
said, I choose...

28:43.763 --> 28:44.972
him.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.891
- [gasps] Courtney.
- Courtney?

28:46.974 --> 28:48.643
Yeah, my grandmother was --

28:48.726 --> 28:51.520
You tell anyone it's Courtney,
and I will kill you.

28:51.604 --> 28:54.106
What, are you sleeping?
Tell me you're not sleeping!

28:54.190 --> 28:56.901
While we've been up working on
your decontamination problem!

28:56.984 --> 28:58.903
I-I-I was
resting my eyes.

28:58.986 --> 29:00.196
What are you, my dad?

29:00.279 --> 29:02.114
Did you get all tuckered out
watching "Matlock"?

29:02.198 --> 29:04.116
Yeah, Grandpa.
Had too much Chinese buffet

29:04.200 --> 29:06.118
and drifted off watching
"Murder, She Wrote"?

29:06.202 --> 29:08.037
Yeah, he's got to watch
his "Jessica."

29:08.120 --> 29:11.165
Hilarious. Did you solve the
decontamination problem or what?

29:11.249 --> 29:13.334
We're Conjectural Technologies!
Piece o' cake!

29:13.417 --> 29:15.503
Oh, yeah, the device
is all built and ready.

29:15.586 --> 29:18.881
We just got to borrow your old
plasma engine to power it up.

29:18.965 --> 29:21.509
Yeah... I...
kind of sold it to St. Cloud.

29:21.592 --> 29:23.261
What, are you
fucking kidding me?!

29:23.344 --> 29:25.680
The engine from the floating
platform in episode 204,

29:25.763 --> 29:27.765
"The Disappearing Rocketboy
Mystery"?

29:27.848 --> 29:29.642
- Kinda.
- How could you?!

29:29.725 --> 29:31.394
St. Cloud is my archenemy!

29:31.477 --> 29:33.020
Like, legally my archenemy!

29:33.104 --> 29:34.897
Yeah, well,
welcome to the good-guy team.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.066
Oh, smooth, Rust.
Now we got to go get it back.

29:37.149 --> 29:38.067
Can't wait.

29:38.150 --> 29:40.069
Tell me you at least solved
the mutation problem.

29:40.152 --> 29:42.071
I've been
running simulations.

29:42.154 --> 29:43.531
All of them have ended
in their death.

29:43.614 --> 29:45.491
That's Oregon Trail
you're playing!

29:45.574 --> 29:47.493
Did you do the rest of your
tests in Free Cell?!

29:47.576 --> 29:49.537
I-I-I'm doing
the best I can!

29:49.620 --> 29:51.247
Palo Salazar is dead!

29:51.330 --> 29:54.625
If Palo Salazar couldn't solve it,
what are my chances?

29:54.709 --> 29:56.585
Who's Palo Salazar?

29:56.669 --> 29:58.671
MRS. MONARCH: He was once
the world's foremost authority

29:58.754 --> 30:00.464
on genetic mutations.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.216
And then after being belted

30:02.300 --> 30:04.093
by super-magnetized ions
and plasma...

30:04.176 --> 30:06.304
Now he's wrecking the town
with the power of a bull?

30:06.387 --> 30:08.389
Ain't no monster clown
who is as loveable?

30:08.472 --> 30:10.099
Close.

30:10.182 --> 30:13.185
He becomes a circus freak known
as Palo, The Human Beetle.

30:13.269 --> 30:16.564
Then he disappears --
presumed dead.

30:16.647 --> 30:20.318
- But the story doesn't end there.
- No, it doesn't.

30:20.401 --> 30:22.778
Around that time,
a beetle-themed supervillain

30:22.862 --> 30:24.572
called Bugaboo
appears out of nowhere.

30:24.655 --> 30:26.657
And does he rob banks?
No.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.868
He steals lithium,
nanophosphates,

30:28.951 --> 30:31.287
and a whole list
of crazy things.

30:31.370 --> 30:34.498
And that list of crazy things
is in Guild records?

30:34.582 --> 30:37.585
Nope.
It's right... there.

30:37.668 --> 30:40.504
Oh, I'm so turned on.
Let me do you here on the desk!

30:40.588 --> 30:43.341
Sweetie, I have to finish
my work on these mutations.

30:43.424 --> 30:44.967
Finish me!

30:45.051 --> 30:47.136
I'm all revved up from that
"Hart to Hart"-style repartee

30:47.219 --> 30:48.512
we had there.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.681
Come on! Just a handy?

30:50.765 --> 30:52.850
MAN:
An army of uniformed henchmen

30:52.933 --> 30:55.186
is ready to obey your
every order.

30:55.269 --> 30:57.146
What could possibly go wrong?

30:57.229 --> 30:59.565
Learn to recognize
the telltale warning signs

30:59.648 --> 31:01.442
of a blunderer.

31:01.525 --> 31:03.194
This henchman looks all right.

31:03.277 --> 31:04.779
But look closer.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.782
His safety is still on.
His tunic is untucked.

31:07.865 --> 31:09.450
And his boot is untied.

31:09.533 --> 31:11.327
What's with all this
blundering?

31:11.410 --> 31:13.621
Duh, hi, Doctor-Z!

31:13.704 --> 31:16.123
Well, if it isn't
Mr. Blunder, the --

31:16.207 --> 31:18.167
Dur... I tried my hardest.

31:18.250 --> 31:20.586
And that's what a Mr. Blunder
will say.

31:20.669 --> 31:22.671
But you must be firm
with a blunderer.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.841
You have blundered...
for the last time!

31:25.925 --> 31:27.009
[ Clatter]
Pei?

31:27.093 --> 31:29.678
Did we hear a little boomski
downstairs?

31:29.762 --> 31:31.597
- Hnh?
- Will you be careful?!

31:31.680 --> 31:33.682
The guy has knickknacks
everywhere!

31:33.766 --> 31:35.684
That knickknack is
the staff of Ra.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.770
Well, he put it
at head level!

31:37.853 --> 31:39.021
It's too high.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.816
He should've taken back one
Kadam to honor the Hebrew God.

They're digging in the wrong place!

31:44.693 --> 31:46.362
[sniffs]
Oh, Billy!

31:46.445 --> 31:48.781
What, did you crap yourself?
In excitement, maybe?

31:48.864 --> 31:52.076
No. I was gonna ask you.
It smells like death in here.

31:52.159 --> 31:53.661
[ rustling ]

31:53.744 --> 31:55.371
BOTH:
Aaah--

31:55.454 --> 31:56.789
[ muffled screaming ]

31:56.872 --> 31:59.083
Drop.
Slagathor, drop.

31:59.166 --> 32:02.128
Don't eat daddy's new
archenemies

32:02.211 --> 32:04.380
until he's had his fun.

32:06.048 --> 32:08.092
GARY: Boy-Band.
Come in, Boy-Band.

32:08.175 --> 32:10.511
What's your 20?
- You're 20?

32:10.594 --> 32:13.264
- I thought you were #21.
- He's using police code, dingus!

32:13.347 --> 32:15.224
We're hiding, holding
baseball bats.

32:15.307 --> 32:17.518
Pretty sure the big orange guys
are eating everybody.

32:17.601 --> 32:20.521
They're like a bunch of Floridians
all jacked up on bath salts.

32:20.604 --> 32:22.606
All right, whatever.
I'm assembling the team for action.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.984
Do you need extraction
from your position?

32:25.067 --> 32:27.069
No, we can just run
across the yard, screaming.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.113
Pretty sure I'm scared enough
to piss myself,

32:29.196 --> 32:31.240
and nobody wants to eat a kid
all soaked in pee.

32:31.323 --> 32:33.617
Papa V., do you have
the antidote?

32:33.701 --> 32:35.244
Kinda busy now.

32:35.327 --> 32:37.079
Oh, uh... it's cool.
You know, we all do it.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.789
We all soak our bunions?

32:38.873 --> 32:40.791
Oh. I thought you were
having a push.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.210
A "push"?
That's disgusting!

32:43.294 --> 32:44.587
Where'd you even get that from?

32:44.670 --> 32:46.338
I don't remember
where I got that, but whatever.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.424
How's the antidote going?
- I whipped up a little cocktail

32:48.507 --> 32:51.177
of metyrapone,
flunitrazepam, baby aspirin,

32:51.260 --> 32:53.095
antibiotics,
and some other goodies.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.639
It should... do something.
- Sweet.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.683
All right, get into position
for antidote application.

32:57.766 --> 32:59.768
Over and out.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.437
Blondie, Shorty, come in.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.856
I don't even want to know why
you're on the other line.

33:03.939 --> 33:06.734
So just listen.
I'm inside.

33:06.817 --> 33:09.111
Dean's with me,
but he's not exactly safe,

33:09.195 --> 33:13.491
so if you are planning a rescue,
now's the time!

33:13.574 --> 33:16.494
Great.
Blondie, Shorty! Come in!

33:16.577 --> 33:19.830
WHITE: Ugh! That was foul!
What was that?

33:19.914 --> 33:22.625
Slagathor is a corpse/flower hybrid.

33:22.708 --> 33:24.627
He is a cutting from the
man-eating plant

33:24.710 --> 33:27.755
in the 1956 B-movie
"Voodoo lsland,"

33:27.838 --> 33:29.465
starring Mr. Boris Karloff.

33:29.548 --> 33:32.760
With "Batman's" Adam West,
and it was 1957.

33:32.843 --> 33:34.845
So, uh, who's your
muscle?

33:34.929 --> 33:36.805
Oh, that's Pei Wie.

33:36.889 --> 33:38.724
He's a rare Asian albino.

33:38.807 --> 33:41.685
Much more collectible than
your domestic albino.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.771
Big whoop.
I have better hair.

33:43.854 --> 33:46.524
- So, you come for an arching?
- Not tonight.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.151
We just want the floating platform
you bought from Venture.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.487
Of course.
Let me just get that for you.

33:51.570 --> 33:53.739
Really?
[ chuckles ] Awesome.

33:53.822 --> 33:57.326
- Thanks, guy.
- It will only cost Billy one dollar.

33:57.409 --> 33:59.203
Yes, the same amount Billy
sniped me

33:59.286 --> 34:01.497
in our recent eBay joust.

34:01.580 --> 34:03.791
Oh, my God.
Will you get over that?!

34:03.874 --> 34:05.918
I won the Rusty Mego doll
fair and square.

34:06.001 --> 34:07.628
Sure you did, Quizboy.

34:07.711 --> 34:10.214
Just like you "won" a certain
fixed game show

34:10.297 --> 34:12.507
when we were both 15.

34:12.591 --> 34:14.760
Just 100 pennies.

34:14.842 --> 34:17.388
Eat them, and the plasma engine
is yours.

34:17.471 --> 34:19.974
- I'm not gonna eat pennies!
- Billy, eat the pennies.

34:20.056 --> 34:23.018
It's -- it's just pennies.
So you poop pennies -- big deal!

34:23.101 --> 34:25.228
All right.
I'll sweeten the pot.

34:25.312 --> 34:27.731
- [ Beeps ]
- BILLY: A H.E.L.P.Er. Model?

34:27.815 --> 34:29.775
It's the real H.E.L.P.Er.,
thank you.

34:29.858 --> 34:31.860
I recently purchased him
from Dr. Venture.

34:31.944 --> 34:35.364
Aw, he sold H.E.L.P.Er., too?
That is just cold.

34:35.447 --> 34:38.199
Eat the pennies,
and he's yours, as well.

34:38.284 --> 34:40.619
- Just eat the pennies.
- Eat the pennies, Quizboy.

34:40.703 --> 34:42.663
- Eat the pennies.
- I won't eat pennies!

34:42.746 --> 34:44.790
Listen to your sidekick
and eat the pennies.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.208
