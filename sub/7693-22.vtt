WEBVTT

00:06.337 --> 00:09.580
HEY! HEY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:09.580 --> 00:11.442
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE ALONE

00:11.442 --> 00:13.444
AROUND ANYTHING
WITH BUTTONS!

00:13.444 --> 00:16.587
I'M PRANKING CHASE
FOR APRIL FOOLS!

00:16.587 --> 00:17.748
IT'S NOVEMBER.

00:17.748 --> 00:20.521
EXACTLY. APRIL'S WHEN
PEOPLE EXPECT TO BE PRANKED.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.393
BUT IF I DO IT TODAY,
WHAMMO!

00:22.393 --> 00:24.695
IT'S LIKE A BABY
WITH A MUSTACHE.

00:24.695 --> 00:27.158
YOU DON'T SEE IT COMING.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.460
SO WHAT'S THE PRANK?

00:29.460 --> 00:31.332
I RIGGED CHASE'S CAPSULE
SO WHEN HE STEPS IN,

00:31.332 --> 00:34.665
HE'LL BE SHOWERED BY
50 GALLONS OF EXPIRED MILK!

00:34.665 --> 00:36.537
OH, 49 GALLONS.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.340
I NEEDED SOMETHING
FOR MY CEREAL.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.274
UGH. WHERE DID YOU GET
50 GALLONS OF EXPIRED MILK?

00:43.274 --> 00:44.575
OH, IT DOESN'T COME THAT WAY.

00:44.575 --> 00:47.818
YOU HAVE TO BUY
50 GALLONS OF MILK
AND WAIT.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.582
OOH, HERE HE COMES.
ACT COOL.

00:51.582 --> 00:52.653
I DON'T NEED TO ACT.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.126
IT'S IN MY BLOOD, BABY.

00:56.587 --> 00:59.490
LET ME GUESS--
PRANKING CHASE AGAIN?

00:59.490 --> 01:00.561
NO.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.793
YEAH.

01:02.793 --> 01:05.436
ADAM, YOU ARE SO IMMATURE.

01:05.436 --> 01:08.099
EH. I BEEN CALLED WORSE.

01:08.099 --> 01:10.371
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M GOING TO BED.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.644
WAKE ME UP WHEN I'M
OLD ENOUGH TO MOVE OUT.

01:21.612 --> 01:25.156
OH, CHASE'S CAPSULE IS
THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE!

01:27.288 --> 01:30.321
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

01:30.321 --> 01:34.425
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

01:34.425 --> 01:36.767
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

01:36.767 --> 01:38.729
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

01:38.729 --> 01:40.201
♪♪

01:41.572 --> 01:43.574
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:44.535 --> 01:47.378
♪ LAB RATS ♪

01:55.886 --> 01:57.548

02:16.667 --> 02:20.541
( squeegee squeaking )

02:20.541 --> 02:23.244
RIG THE WRONG CAPSULE
AGAIN, ADAM?

02:23.244 --> 02:26.577
MAYBE.

02:26.577 --> 02:30.521
WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE?

02:30.521 --> 02:32.523
AND WHY DOES MY LAB
SMELL LIKE

02:32.523 --> 02:36.727
A LOCKER ROOM AT A GYM
THAT ONLY COWS GO TO?

02:36.727 --> 02:38.789
HONEY, WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

02:38.789 --> 02:41.632
WHO DO YOU THINK?

02:41.632 --> 02:42.933
WOW.

02:42.933 --> 02:44.535
RUINING PRANKS
AND BLAMING OTHERS.

02:44.535 --> 02:47.438
NOT MAKIN' ANY FRIENDS
TODAY, ARE YOU, BREE?

02:49.440 --> 02:50.741
GRANDMA ROSE
IS VISITING TOMORROW

02:50.741 --> 02:53.204
AND I WANT
THIS BEHAVIOR TO STOP.

02:53.204 --> 02:54.705
YOU THREE GO GET
THE CLEANING SUPPLIES.

02:54.705 --> 02:56.607
NOW!

02:56.607 --> 03:00.681
I'M SO SICK OF GETTING CAUGHT
IN THEIR CROSSFIRE.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.213
LAST WEEK,
CHASE WAS PRANKING ADAM,

03:02.213 --> 03:04.485
AND I ENDED UP
IN A PET STORE WINDOW!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.457
( laughing )

03:06.457 --> 03:07.558
THAT'S FUNNY!

03:07.558 --> 03:11.422
LOOK, I WILL TALK TO THEM,
I WILL LAY DOWN THE LAW.

03:11.422 --> 03:14.495
THANK YOU.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.428
LOOK, DON'T TELL TASHA
I TOLD YOU THIS,

03:17.428 --> 03:19.730
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE
GONNA GET THEM TO STOP

03:19.730 --> 03:21.602
IS TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.705
YOU HAVE TO PRANK THEM,
AND YOU HAVE TO PRANK THEM HARD.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.507
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'LL WORK?

03:26.507 --> 03:28.579
DEFINITELY.
ALTHOUGH I WOULD ACT FAST,

03:28.579 --> 03:29.910
BECAUSE I KNOW
FOR A FACT ADAM

03:29.910 --> 03:33.584
HAS A BARREL
FULL OF EXPIRED MEAT
HE'S JUST DYIN' TO USE.

03:35.816 --> 03:41.722
( television music )

03:42.593 --> 03:45.626
SO JANELLE,
YOU KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.729
NO, BUT PLEASE
STOP THE BEST PART OF
THE MOVIE AND TELL ME.

03:50.361 --> 03:53.404
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY! YEAH!

03:53.404 --> 03:55.566
OOH.

03:55.566 --> 03:59.540
IT'S BEEN 150 DAYS
SINCE YOU FIRST SPOKE TO ME.

03:59.540 --> 04:02.613
I BELIEVE THE WORDS WERE:
"THIS ISN'T THE MEN'S ROOM."

04:03.874 --> 04:07.548
NEXT THING I SAID WAS,
"NO, SERIOUSLY. GET OUT."

04:07.548 --> 04:08.749
( knocking on door )

04:10.381 --> 04:12.252
HELLO!
 GRANDMA!

04:12.252 --> 04:14.024
HEY, THERE'S MY
LITTLE BOY!

04:14.024 --> 04:15.656
OH, LET ME GRAB
THAT FACE!

04:15.656 --> 04:17.887
LET ME JUST GRAB IT!
OOH, YOU SO HANDSOME!

04:17.887 --> 04:20.591
EASY ON THE FACE.
THAT'S MY MONEY.

04:21.692 --> 04:23.033
GRANDMA...
 MM-HMM.

04:23.033 --> 04:24.465
THIS IS JANELLE.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.937
SHE'S KIND OF
THE SPECIAL LADY IN MY LIFE.

04:26.937 --> 04:31.402
SLOW DOWN, COWBOY.
IT'S ONLY BEEN 150 DAYS.

04:31.402 --> 04:34.545
SO, YOUR SPECIAL LADY, HUH?

04:34.545 --> 04:38.349
WELL, I GUESS SINCE
SHE'S SO... SPECIAL...

04:38.349 --> 04:41.952
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET
TO KNOW THIS... JANELLE.

04:41.952 --> 04:44.485
I LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING
TO KNOW YOU, TOO, MISSUS...

04:44.485 --> 04:46.557
UH, SORRY,
WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU?

04:46.557 --> 04:49.520
LET'S START WITH MA'AM
AND JUST LEAVE IT THERE.

04:50.821 --> 04:53.364
SO CHANTELLE...
 IT'S JANELLE.

04:53.364 --> 04:54.695
WHATEVER.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.697
YOU KNOW JANELLE
AND I WERE ACTUALLY

04:56.697 --> 04:58.469
IN THE MIDDLE OF
WATCHING A MOVIE.

04:58.469 --> 05:00.701
YEAH?
WELL, I'M HERE NOW.

05:06.537 --> 05:07.778
ARE YOU WEARING LIPSTICK?

05:07.778 --> 05:09.910
IT'S LIP GLOSS.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.613
SEE THAT? RIGHT THERE,
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.984
MM-HMM?

05:15.586 --> 05:17.548
WELL, AT LEAST SHE
DIDN'T SPIT ON IT FIRST.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.827
( elevator bell dings )

05:29.400 --> 05:32.403
OH, UH, HEY, GUYS.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

05:32.403 --> 05:34.665
SIX FEET, TWO INCHES.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.367
OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO ANSWER.

05:36.367 --> 05:38.769
I KNOW GROWING'S
BEEN A LIFELONG
STRUGGLE FOR YOU.

05:40.110 --> 05:41.612
WAIT A SECOND.

05:41.612 --> 05:44.945
WHOOPEE CUSHION,
BUCKET OF ICE WATER,

05:44.945 --> 05:46.577
GREASED FLOOR.

05:46.577 --> 05:49.680
NOPE.
NOTHING SUSPICIOUS HERE.

05:50.581 --> 05:54.655
SERIOUSLY, DO YOU THINK
I WAS BORN TOMORROW?

05:54.655 --> 05:55.756
UGH!

05:55.756 --> 05:57.428
I HATE YOU GUYS.

05:57.428 --> 05:59.990
BUT I AM SO
GONNA GET YOU BACK.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.992
PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS,
KEEP TRYING.

06:01.992 --> 06:05.135
YOUR FAILURE IS ADORABLE.

06:05.135 --> 06:07.137
( cellphone rings )

06:07.137 --> 06:08.899
UH-OH!
URGENT MISSION ALERT!

06:08.899 --> 06:10.441
THERE'S A LETHAL VIRUS
OUTBREAK IN DENVER!

06:10.441 --> 06:11.902
BREE, YOU HAVE TO
SUPER-SPEED THERE AHEAD OF US

06:11.902 --> 06:13.103
OR WE'LL BE TOO LATE!

06:13.103 --> 06:14.505
ON IT!

06:14.505 --> 06:16.547
Adam: OHH!

06:16.547 --> 06:18.709
HA! I SET UP
A FAKE MISSION ALERT!

06:18.709 --> 06:22.112
I KNEW YOU'D FALL FOR IT!

06:22.112 --> 06:23.554
GOOD ONE.

06:23.554 --> 06:27.588
NOW STOP MESSING AROUND.
WE GOTTA GET TO DENVER.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.621
FACE IT, BREE. YOU'LL
NEVER OUTWIT THE MASTERS.

06:34.525 --> 06:38.429
SO YOU TRIED TO PRANK THE BOYS,
AND IT BLEW UP IN YOUR FACE.

06:38.429 --> 06:39.630
IS IT THAT OBVIOUS?

06:39.630 --> 06:41.632
NO, I WAS WATCHING
FROM UPSTAIRS.

06:41.632 --> 06:42.933
MAN,
YOU REALLY ATE IT!

06:42.933 --> 06:47.678
WELL, IT'S JUST NOT
IN MY NATURE TO BE
STUPID AND IMMATURE.

06:47.678 --> 06:50.781
WELL, GOOD THING
IT'S IN MINE.

06:50.781 --> 06:53.043
I'M GONNA HELP YOU
OUT BECAUSE WHEN IT
COMES TO PRANKS,

06:53.043 --> 06:55.616
I AM THE UNDISPUTED CHAMP.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.887
HELP ME OUT.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.889
IS THAT YOUR NICE WAY
OF SAYING

06:58.889 --> 07:00.621
YOU'RE GONNA DO THE WHOLE
THING BY YOURSELF

07:00.621 --> 07:02.553
WHILE I SIT THERE AND WATCH?

07:02.553 --> 07:03.654
NO, I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE NICE.

07:03.654 --> 07:05.456
YOU'RE REALLY TERRIBLE
AT THIS.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.566
SO?

07:15.566 --> 07:17.007
WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF MY GRANDMA?

07:17.007 --> 07:19.770
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF YOUR GRANDMA?

07:21.071 --> 07:24.715
OKAY, LOOK, I KNOW
SHE CAN BE A BIT...

07:24.715 --> 07:26.747
OVERPROTECTIVE,

07:26.747 --> 07:28.549
BUT DON'T WORRY.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.751
I THINK WE'RE THROUGH
THE WORST OF IT.

07:30.751 --> 07:34.184
Grandma Rose:
LEO! LEO DOOLEY!

07:34.184 --> 07:36.557
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKIN'
FOR LEO DOOLEY.

07:36.557 --> 07:37.588
MIDDLE NAME FRANCIS.

07:37.588 --> 07:40.991
ANYBODY HERE KNOW
LEO FRANCIS DOOLEY?

07:40.991 --> 07:43.764
LATE BLOOMER?
SHORT FOR HIS AGE?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.966
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE
A THANK-YOU CARD

07:45.966 --> 07:48.839
WHEN HE GETS A $5 BILL
ON HIS BIRTHDAY?

07:48.839 --> 07:50.000
EASILY EMBARRASSED?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.171
HORRIFIED BY RELATIVES?

07:51.171 --> 07:53.674
NEEDS A BETTER
HIDING PLACE?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.076
OH, LEO, THERE'S
MY PRECIOUS ANGEL BOY.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.778
GET UP FROM THERE.
YOU DON'T KNOW

07:57.778 --> 08:00.751
WHERE THAT FLOOR
HAS BEEN, BOY!

08:00.751 --> 08:01.752
OH.

08:01.752 --> 08:04.715
I SEE YOU DRESS
INAPPROPRIATELY
AT SCHOOL, TOO.

08:05.756 --> 08:07.718
GRANDMA, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:07.718 --> 08:11.692
WELL, LITTLE MISS LIP GLOSS
LEFT HER PHONE AT OUR HOUSE.

08:11.692 --> 08:13.694
AND WHAT'S WITH
ALL YOUR TEXTING?

08:13.694 --> 08:17.768
I TELL YOU, LEO, THAT IS
NO WAY FOR A LADY
TO COMMUNICATE.

08:17.768 --> 08:19.730
NOW, IN MY DAY
WE WROTE A LETTER
AND WAITED.

08:19.730 --> 08:22.673
IF WE DIDN'T HEAR BACK,
WE KNEW EITHER THEY
DIDN'T LIKE US,

08:22.673 --> 08:24.935
OR THEY WERE DEAD.

08:24.935 --> 08:26.807
YOU WENT
THROUGH MY PHONE?

08:26.807 --> 08:27.978
DON'T TAKE
THAT TONE WITH ME.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.509
IT'S AN HONEST MISTAKE.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.612
YOUR PHONE LOOKS
EXACTLY LIKE MINE.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.746
I NEVER SAW SO MANY
SMILEY FACES IN MY LIFE.

08:35.746 --> 08:37.116
WHAT'S SHE SO HAPPY ABOUT?

08:37.116 --> 08:39.620
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
GRANDMA, FOR STOPPING BY.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.221
YOU CAN GO NOW.
 NO, NO!

08:41.221 --> 08:42.893
THEY'RE HOLDING
A TABLE FOR US

08:42.893 --> 08:44.294
AT MADAME LADYFINGERS'
HOUSE OF TEA!

08:44.294 --> 08:47.558
AND I'M NOT GOING
WITHOUT MY FAVORITE
TEA PARTNER!

08:47.558 --> 08:50.931
LEO, I THINK YOU
KINDA HAVE TO MAKE
A CHOICE HERE.

08:55.265 --> 08:58.268
I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO.
SHE'S MY NANA.

08:58.268 --> 09:00.040
LET'S GO, LEO.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.773
( chuckling )
 I'LL CALL YOU LATER,
JANELLE.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.074
NOT ON HER PHONE,
YOU WON'T.

09:04.074 --> 09:05.215
I TOOK THE BATTERY OUT.

09:05.215 --> 09:06.947
( cackling )

09:10.881 --> 09:12.723
GREAT! THIS IS
GONNA BE GREAT!

09:12.723 --> 09:17.728
I HID A HIGH-POWERED AIRBAG
INSIDE THE COUCH CUSHION.

09:17.728 --> 09:21.662
AS SOON AS ADAM AND CHASE
SIT DOWN FOR THEIR
AFTER-SCHOOL VIDEO GAMES,

09:21.662 --> 09:23.794
BOOM! THEY'RE GONNA BE
AIRBORNE!

09:23.794 --> 09:26.036
WAIT,
ISN'T THIS DANGEROUS?

09:26.036 --> 09:27.738
PLEASE SAY YES.

09:27.738 --> 09:31.772
( both giggle )
 THIS IS GOING TO BE
THE GREATEST PRANK EVER!

09:31.772 --> 09:33.774
WHOA, PRANK! WHAT PRANK?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.707
NO, NOT PRANK.
I DIDN'T SAY PRANK.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.949
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
MY FRIEND FRANK, ACTUALLY.

09:38.949 --> 09:41.251
YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM.
BIG GUY. GERMAN.

09:41.251 --> 09:43.353
ENORMOUS TOES.

09:43.353 --> 09:44.815
OH, PLEASE,
GIVE US A BREAK.

09:44.815 --> 09:47.688
WE KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO HELP BREE GET
BACK AT US,

09:47.688 --> 09:49.059
AND IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

09:49.059 --> 09:52.592
WAIT, IF HIS TOES
ARE THAT BIG, I REALLY
NEED TO MEET HIM.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.697
( stage whisper )
ABORT PRANK! ABORT PRANK!

09:56.697 --> 09:59.169
JUST 'CAUSE YOU SAY IT
OUT OF THE SIDE OF YOUR MOUTH

09:59.169 --> 10:00.771
DOES NOT MEAN
WE CANNOT HEAR YOU.

10:02.633 --> 10:05.706
LEO, HONEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.337
YOU BARELY TOUCHED
YOUR TEA, AND THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

10:07.337 --> 10:09.910
YOU REFUSED TO WEAR
THE MATCHING HAT.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.744
I'M SORRY, GRANDMA.
I JUST FEEL BAD ABOUT
BLOWING OFF JANELLE.

10:13.744 --> 10:17.888
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU WOULD RATHER SPEND
TIME WITH HER THAN ME?

10:17.888 --> 10:19.189
NO, YOU SAID IT.

10:19.189 --> 10:20.390
BUT YES.

10:20.390 --> 10:22.352
( theatrical gasping )

10:22.352 --> 10:23.894
OH, THIS COULD BE
THE BIG ONE.

10:23.894 --> 10:25.656
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

10:25.656 --> 10:28.959
WAIT, NO!
 AAAAHHHH!

10:30.701 --> 10:32.733
WHOA!

10:34.104 --> 10:36.867
ROSE, ARE YOU OKAY?

10:36.867 --> 10:39.109
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M OKAY?

10:47.277 --> 10:48.749
GRANDMA!

10:48.749 --> 10:49.950
OH, HEY, SUGAR, I'M OKAY.
 ROSE.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.953
GET AWAY FROM ME!
CAN'T YOU SEE I'M IN PAIN!

10:55.425 --> 10:57.928
WE'RE LUCKY IT WAS
JUST A SPRAINED ANKLE.

10:57.928 --> 10:59.790
YOU TWO ARE IN BIG TROUBLE!

10:59.790 --> 11:01.762
AN AIRBAG IN MY SOFA?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.263
IT WASN'T US!

11:03.263 --> 11:05.435
DON'T DO IT,
DON'T DO IT...!

11:05.435 --> 11:06.997
IT WAS MR. DAVENPORT!

11:06.997 --> 11:08.939
GAAAAHHH!

11:08.939 --> 11:11.942
DONALD... IS THAT TRUE?

11:11.942 --> 11:14.104
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED WAS...

11:14.104 --> 11:16.106
THERE COMES A MOMENT...

11:16.106 --> 11:19.079
( stammering )
IT WAS ALL BREE!

11:19.079 --> 11:20.781
EXCUSE ME?!

11:22.312 --> 11:23.814
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:23.814 --> 11:26.787
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO LAY DOWN THE LAW.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.919
YOU LIED TO ME.

11:28.919 --> 11:31.391
OH, HE LIES TO YOU
ABOUT A LOT.

11:33.423 --> 11:35.465
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO TEACH THEM A LESSON.

11:35.465 --> 11:36.767
WHAT LESSON?

11:36.767 --> 11:40.901
UM... THE PRINCIPLES
OF FLIGHT.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.737
WELL, SINCE GRANDMA
WON'T BE ABLE TO GET
AROUND FOR TWO WEEKS,

11:46.737 --> 11:49.780
YOU'RE GONNA BE
WAITING ON HER,
HAND AND FOOT.

11:49.780 --> 11:53.343
WHAT?
 YEP. THAT HAND,
THIS FOOT.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.185
NOW PROP ME UP
WITH THAT PILLOW.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.487
TODAY! COME ON!

11:57.487 --> 11:59.990
GIMME THAT BLANKET!

11:59.990 --> 12:01.491
WHERE'S MY SOUP?!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.024
YEAH, WHERE'S HER SOUP?

12:05.425 --> 12:07.097
I'M SORRY, I JUST
GOT CARRIED AWAY.

12:07.097 --> 12:08.458
I'M HAVING WAY TOO MUCH
FUN WITH THIS.

12:12.332 --> 12:17.367
( ringing bell )

12:17.367 --> 12:19.169
YES, ROSE.

12:19.169 --> 12:20.510
TURN THE TV ON.

12:20.510 --> 12:23.013
THERE IS A REMOTE

12:23.013 --> 12:24.344
RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.376
TASHA!
 NO, NO, NO!
DON'T CALL TASHA.

12:26.376 --> 12:28.478
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
THERE YOU GO.

12:28.478 --> 12:31.521
WELL, HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO HEAR THAT?

12:31.521 --> 12:33.784
( increases volume )

12:33.784 --> 12:35.786
WELL, NOW IT'S TOO LOUD.

12:39.529 --> 12:42.492
( lowers volume )

12:44.094 --> 12:47.898
SO, HOW'S GRANDMA'S
LITTLE HELPER?

12:47.898 --> 12:49.239
( grunts )

12:49.239 --> 12:52.302
I CANNOT TAKE THIS.
I HAVE TO GET HER
OUT OF THIS HOUSE,

12:52.302 --> 12:55.275
TO GET HER MOBILE.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.547
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
A CATAPULT?

12:57.547 --> 12:59.279
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.552
THERE IS NO WAY THE ARC
WOULD GET HER OUT
THE FRONT DOOR.

13:02.552 --> 13:03.914
WAIT.

13:03.914 --> 13:06.286
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.
I JUST NEED TIME
TO BUILD IT.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.557
Rose: NAP TIME!

13:07.557 --> 13:08.819
PERFECT!

13:08.819 --> 13:09.990
WELL, DON'T
JUST STAND THERE.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.862
GET OVER HERE
AND WATCH ME SLEEP.

13:17.928 --> 13:19.069
JANELLE!

13:21.331 --> 13:24.304
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD ABOUT ME
DITCHING YOU,

13:24.304 --> 13:27.807
BUT I HAVE GREAT NEWS.
MY NANA'S BADLY HURT!

13:29.109 --> 13:31.181
HOW IS THAT GREAT NEWS?

13:31.181 --> 13:33.813
WHAT I MEAN IS, SHE CAN'T
BOTHER US ANYMORE!

13:33.813 --> 13:35.445
NO MORE TEA DATES!

13:35.445 --> 13:38.488
FROM HERE ON OUT,
I AM ALL YOURS.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.921
( students clamoring )

13:40.921 --> 13:42.592
Young Man: RUN!

13:42.592 --> 13:44.394
COMING THROUGH!

13:45.555 --> 13:48.228
LOOK WHAT DONALD
JIMMIED UP FOR ME

13:48.228 --> 13:49.529
SO I WOULDN'T BE STUCK
ON THE COUCH ALL DAY.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.501
ISN'T IT WONDERFUL?

13:51.501 --> 13:52.963
IT'S SOMETHING.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.205
I GET TO SPEND ALL DAY
WITH YOU

13:55.205 --> 13:56.566
WHILE MY ANKLE HEALS.

13:56.566 --> 14:00.110
IT EVEN HAS
A PROGRAMMABLE GBF.

14:00.110 --> 14:02.372
OH, I THINK YOU MEAN GPS.

14:02.372 --> 14:04.414
ARE YOU CORRECTING ME?

14:04.414 --> 14:09.479
NO. NO, MA'AM.
YOU ARE RIGHT
AND I AM ALWAYS WRONG.

14:09.479 --> 14:11.481
MY POINT IS,

14:11.481 --> 14:13.083
I CAN GO ANYWHERE.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.554
WATCH THIS.

14:15.485 --> 14:17.487
SORRY.
 OHH! OH, MY BAD.

14:17.487 --> 14:19.559
OH, YOU POOR THING.
DID I RUN OVER YOU?

14:19.559 --> 14:20.961
OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST
CAN'T FIGURE

14:20.961 --> 14:22.032
HOW TO WORK THIS THING OUT.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.863
I'M JUST A CONFUSED
OLD LADY!

14:23.863 --> 14:26.636
Janelle:
OKAY. OKAY.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.242
OKAY, BABY,
I'LL COME BACK
AND PICK YOU UP!

14:38.578 --> 14:40.610
( video game sounds )

14:40.610 --> 14:43.383
OH, HEY, BREE, COULD YOU
GRAB ME A WATER?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.385
I'M TRYING TO BEAT
CHASE'S HIGH SCORE,

14:45.385 --> 14:47.217
AND IF I STOP,
HIS CYBORG WILL MELT ME,

14:47.217 --> 14:48.919
AND IF THAT HAPPENS,
A NUCLONIUM BOMB
WILL GO OFF,

14:48.919 --> 14:51.391
AND IF THAT HAPPENS--
 I WILL GET YOUR WATER!

14:51.391 --> 14:53.463
JUST STOP TALKING!

14:55.495 --> 14:58.068
HEY GUYS. WHAT DO YOU
WANT FOR DINNER?

14:58.068 --> 14:59.529
NO! DON'T OPEN THE...

14:59.529 --> 15:00.630
AAAHHH!

15:04.074 --> 15:05.575
...FRIDGE.

15:09.139 --> 15:10.410
WOULD IT HELP AT ALL
IF WE SAID

15:10.410 --> 15:12.682
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE BREE'S FACE?

15:14.644 --> 15:17.988
BUT IT LOOKS JUST
AS GOOD ON YOU.

15:17.988 --> 15:20.290
I DON'T CARE
WHO THE PRANK WAS FOR.

15:20.290 --> 15:22.122
GO GET SOMETHING
TO CLEAN THIS MESS UP.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.323
NOW!

15:24.694 --> 15:26.496
THOSE BOYS NEVER LEARN
THEIR LESSON,

15:26.496 --> 15:28.928
AND SOMEONE ELSE ALWAYS
ENDS UP PAYING FOR IT.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.700
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.562
NO.

15:32.562 --> 15:35.966
I THINK IT IS TIME
TO WELCOME THEM
TO MY WORLD.

15:35.966 --> 15:38.608
RIGHT.

15:38.608 --> 15:41.111
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:41.111 --> 15:42.572
IT MEANS...

15:42.572 --> 15:45.315
NOBODY MAKES ME
A HUMAN HOTDOG.

15:45.315 --> 15:46.516
RIGHT.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.519
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:49.519 --> 15:52.522
HEY, LOOK WHO'S TRYING
TO COOK AGAIN!

15:58.288 --> 16:01.131
ALL RIGHT, SO,
I DITCHED MY GRANDMA
AT THE FOOTBALL GAME.

16:01.131 --> 16:02.962
WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
OF ALONE TIME

16:02.962 --> 16:04.664
BEFORE SHE FINDS ME.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.697
LEO, YOU HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

16:07.697 --> 16:09.599
I TRIED LOSING HER
IN THE MARCHING BAND,

16:09.599 --> 16:11.301
BUT SHE JUST ROLLED OVER
THE TUBA PLAYER

16:11.301 --> 16:12.502
AND KEPT GOING.

16:12.502 --> 16:14.674
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.507
DON'T WORRY, I HAVE A PLAN.

16:17.507 --> 16:21.681
YOU DISTRACT HER
WHILE I PROGRAM HER GPS
TO TAKE HER HOME.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.413
Rose: WHOO-HOO!

16:26.686 --> 16:28.288
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
JUST HAPPENED,

16:28.288 --> 16:30.590
BUT SOMEBODY GAVE ME
A GAME BALL!

16:30.590 --> 16:34.364
UH, GRANDMA ROSE,
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:34.364 --> 16:36.626
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW EYELINER.

16:36.626 --> 16:39.499
IT'S GOT
GLITTER IN IT, SEE?

16:39.499 --> 16:40.770
( Rose gasps )

16:40.770 --> 16:43.533
GLITTER?! GIRL,
THAT'S THE DEVIL'S PAINT.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.135
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO RUN AROUND HERE

16:45.135 --> 16:46.406
LOOKING LIKE A CIRCUS CLOWN.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.039
RESPECT YOUR FACE!

16:49.039 --> 16:50.710
( beeping and trilling )

16:50.710 --> 16:53.243
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT-- WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

16:53.243 --> 16:58.688
WAIT A MINUTE!
IT'S MOVING ALL
BY ITSELF...!

17:00.320 --> 17:02.522
( comical crash;
tuba blows )

17:02.522 --> 17:04.294
TWO TUBA PLAYERS
IN ONE DAY.

17:04.294 --> 17:06.526
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

17:08.558 --> 17:11.560
OH, SO I TRACKED DOWN
DAVENPORT'S FRIEND FRANK.

17:11.560 --> 17:15.734
HIS TOES AREN'T THAT BIG,
BUT HIS FOREHEAD'S HUGE.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.607
OH, HELLO, BOYS.

17:17.607 --> 17:20.069
BREE AND I DECIDED
TO MAKE YOU SOME
HOMEMADE COOKIES.

17:20.069 --> 17:21.570
THEY'RE FRESH
OUT OF THE OVEN.

17:21.570 --> 17:24.513
MNH. FRESH, STALE,
HOT, COLD, JUST PUT
IT IN MY MOUTH.

17:25.575 --> 17:28.078
SINCE WHEN HAS BREE
EVER MADE US COOKIES?

17:28.078 --> 17:29.649
( gasps )
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.651
THANKS A LOT, BREE.
SO KIND OF YOU.

17:34.124 --> 17:35.685
( trilling sound )

17:38.288 --> 17:40.230
JUST AS I SUSPECTED--

17:40.230 --> 17:43.493
NOT ONLY WHERE
THOSE COOKIES MADE WITH
SALT INSTEAD OF SUGAR,

17:43.493 --> 17:46.266
BUT THOSE CHOCOLATE CHIPS
AREN'T CHOCOLATE.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.667
SO... CARAMEL?

17:47.667 --> 17:49.369
NO.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.401
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TRY A LOT HARDER
THAN THAT, BREE.

17:51.401 --> 17:53.743
( groans )
BUSTED AGAIN.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.405
I GIVE UP.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.147
WHAT AN AMATEUR!

17:57.147 --> 17:59.249
TO THINK THAT WE WOULD
FALL FOR THAT!

18:04.314 --> 18:06.085
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.657
YEAH, I'M STUCK.

18:07.657 --> 18:09.519
REALLY, BREE?
THIS IS YOUR PRANK?

18:09.519 --> 18:12.522
GLUE ON THE HANDS?

18:12.522 --> 18:16.196
OH, NO, I GUESS WE'LL HAVE
TO PLAY MORE VIDEO GAMES.

18:16.196 --> 18:19.599
IT'S GONNA BE KINDA HARD
TO DO THAT FROM UP THERE.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.171
UP WHERE?

18:21.171 --> 18:24.204
( deep hum )
 WHOA!

18:28.678 --> 18:31.611
UP THERE. YOUR
CONTROLLERS ARE MADE
OF METALLIC COMPONENTS,

18:31.611 --> 18:34.244
SO ALL WE HAD TO DO
WAS FIND A POWERFUL
MAGNET.

18:34.244 --> 18:35.815
GOOD THING I MARRIED A GUY
WITH FIVE FLOORS

18:35.815 --> 18:38.388
OF EXPENSIVE TECHNO-JUNK!

18:38.388 --> 18:41.120
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.593
YOU FINALLY GOT US.
GOOD JOB, BREE.

18:43.593 --> 18:45.355
OH, NO, THAT WAS NOT
BREE'S PRANK.

18:45.355 --> 18:46.696
IT WAS MINE.

18:46.696 --> 18:49.599
WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE,
SINCE IT ACTUALLY WORKED.

18:51.301 --> 18:52.832
LOOK, WHOEVER'S
PRANK IT WAS,

18:52.832 --> 18:54.364
CAN YOU JUST PUT US DOWN?

18:54.364 --> 18:56.406
OKAY, I'LL LET YOU DOWN.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.544
( both groaning )

19:04.544 --> 19:07.317
RIGHT DOWN INTO A POOL
OF YOUR EXPIRED MILK.

19:08.618 --> 19:10.820
AAAHHH!

19:14.884 --> 19:16.356
( both groaning )

19:16.356 --> 19:19.559
OHH, IT'S DISGUSTING!

19:19.559 --> 19:22.932
AAH. AND MUCH CHUNKIER
THAN I REMEMBER.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.664
YEAH.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.896
THAT'S 'CAUSE I FOUND
YOUR BARREL OF EXPIRED MEAT.

19:26.896 --> 19:29.539
OHH! I WAS SAVING THAT!

19:37.247 --> 19:38.908
HEY, LEO, WHERE'S
YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

19:38.908 --> 19:42.952
SHE WANTS ME TO ATTACH
A SIDECAR TO YOUR SCOOTER.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.184
AND, YES, IT'S FOR YOU.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.517
WAIT, SHE ISN'T BACK YET?

19:47.517 --> 19:49.659
I PROGRAMMED THE GPS
ON HER SCOOTER

19:49.659 --> 19:51.591
TO BRING
HER BACK HOURS AGO.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.923
YOU WHAT?!

19:53.923 --> 19:57.597
WHO AM I KIDDING?
I'D HAVE DITCHED HER TOO.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.670
OKAY, LET ME TRACK HER.

20:02.532 --> 20:07.437
YOU DID SET "HOME"
TO OUR ADDRESS IN
MISSION CREEK, RIGHT?

20:07.437 --> 20:10.340
YEAH.
 WELL, YOU ONLY MADE
ONE MISTAKE.

20:10.340 --> 20:13.243
SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO MISSION CREEK,
ILLINOIS!

20:15.485 --> 20:17.647
Both: OHH, BOY.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
( trunk horn blares )

20:20.620 --> 20:24.694
HEY, GET OFF ME!
I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN!

20:24.694 --> 20:26.396
GO AROUND!

20:26.396 --> 20:29.659
I'VE HAD MY BLINKER ON
FOR 165 MILES!

20:29.659 --> 20:31.901
( truck horn blares )
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:31.901 --> 20:33.433
YOU GON' RUN OUT OF GAS
PRETTY SOON,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.935
AND WHEN YOU DO,
GRANDMA'S GON' BE RIGHT THERE!

20:42.642 --> 20:45.445
( deep hum )

20:52.282 --> 20:54.584
WHOA!

20:54.584 --> 20:55.785
NOT BAD.

20:59.929 --> 21:01.791
WHOA-HO! BETTER!

21:04.494 --> 21:06.636
GRANDMA, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

21:06.636 --> 21:09.399
"SORRY" DOESN'T BEGIN
TO EXCUSE WHAT YOU DID.

21:09.399 --> 21:12.502
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FLIES
I GOT IN MY DENTURES?

21:12.502 --> 21:15.605
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU KEPT
YOUR MOUTH CLOSED
ONCE IN A WHILE--

21:17.006 --> 21:18.708
I'M REALLY SORRY, TOO.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.709
HM.
