04:21.470 --> 04:22.929
Armando,

04:23.013 --> 04:27.934
why do you care for the calf,
when all of our money is in the herd?

04:28.018 --> 04:34.941
Esteban, one day my father's ranch
will be passed on to my brother and l.

04:35.025 --> 04:39.862
We will want this calf and many more like it.

04:40.238 --> 04:45.076
l still say you care more
for the baby cow than for a woman.

04:46.495 --> 04:49.372
Yes, it's true, Manuel,

04:49.456 --> 04:53.042
but only because
l have not found the right woman.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.164
l propose a contest.

05:32.249 --> 05:35.042
Let's race back to the house!

05:38.422 --> 05:41.590
l hope nothing bad happens
on the way home!

05:42.801 --> 05:45.511
l'm riding a horse!

05:54.271 --> 05:55.521
Get down.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.575
This is not good.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.412
He's a drug dealer!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.123
We should ride down and help this man.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.916
And get killed?

06:18.670 --> 06:21.756
Maybe he just wants to talk to him.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.761
Holy mother.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.015
Praying will not help that man.

06:32.809 --> 06:37.480
Perhaps praying is all we can do.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.115
What are we doing here?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.534
Your brother may already be home!

06:52.954 --> 06:55.581
Fuck, yeah!

06:55.665 --> 06:57.166
Quiet.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.679
Come in.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.685
Father, is this a good time?

07:16.812 --> 07:18.229
What do you want?

07:18.355 --> 07:20.272
Pardon, nothing, sir. l was just...

07:20.357 --> 07:22.191
Where have you been?

07:22.818 --> 07:26.320
We were taking the cattle
to a new pasture as you asked.

07:26.404 --> 07:30.407
What took you so long? There is much work
to do around here, Armando!

07:30.492 --> 07:32.076
ls there something wrong, Father?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.619
Leave me alone.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.666
Armando.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.167
Yes, Father?

07:40.877 --> 07:41.877
Come over here.

07:44.297 --> 07:48.050
Armando, forgive me.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.638
l have many worries.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.225
Please let me help, Father.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.896
You are so much like your mother.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.607
She had such a good heart.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.277
And l know your heart is in the right place,

08:06.361 --> 08:09.488
but like your mother, you are not smart.

08:09.573 --> 08:11.949
You have never been smart.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.159
But l am smart, Father.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.828
Yes, of course, Armando.

08:15.912 --> 08:20.457
For my trouble,
l need someone who is very smart.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.002
lf you were truly smart,

08:23.587 --> 08:25.629
you would know that you are dumb.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.090
Look at your fat head.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.259
Raul!

08:30.427 --> 08:31.427
Raul, your brother.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.386
lt's Raul.

08:36.224 --> 08:39.977
You arrange everything with the Japanese
and then give them the merchandise.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.812
-Raul!
-Brother!

08:46.151 --> 08:48.027
We are close brothers.

08:48.111 --> 08:51.113
We have shared so much, man.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.240
Raul!

08:53.325 --> 08:54.408
Papa!

08:56.953 --> 09:00.956
Finally, the one with brains has returned!

09:01.791 --> 09:05.628
You're the son l've always loved!

09:12.969 --> 09:15.179
Fuck, l almost forgot.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.723
Sweetheart.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.520
May l introduce to you Miss Sonia Lopez?

09:41.957 --> 09:43.249
Sonia Lopez.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.751
lt's an honor to meet you, sir.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.794
lt's nice to meet you.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.255
Let me look at you.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.298
You look amazing.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.968
You must be Armando.

09:54.052 --> 09:57.263
Armando Alvarez, Miss Lopez.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.348
Welcome to our house.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.017
Thank you, but please call me Sonia.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.020
And l can call you Armando?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.481
l would like that, Sonia.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.360
Esteban de los Santos Escobar Chavez.

10:20.704 --> 10:21.870
Sir.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.915
Thank you, Esmeralda.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.333
You're welcome.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.668
Sir.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.879
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.467
Thank you, sweetheart.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.805
Raul, you have brought so much happiness
to our father.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.807
l am an Alvarez, no?

10:43.059 --> 10:47.021
lf only we could keep the drug dealers
off the ranch.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.566
Just this morning,
l was out with Manuel and Esteban,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.818
and we came across a killing.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.237
Why was l not told?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.449
l saw that you had many worries.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.577
They killed a man.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.829
l believe it was by the Onza.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.247
The Onza?

11:07.584 --> 11:09.877
Miss Lopez. Sonia.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.170
How nice to see you.

11:11.254 --> 11:13.380
lt's a pleasure that you're here,

11:13.465 --> 11:15.090
because here...

11:15.175 --> 11:20.179
Armando has never done anything
with a woman.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.057
lt seems like he's not interested in women.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.725
ls this true, Armando?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.852
Do you have no interest in women?

11:26.936 --> 11:30.356
l would not say that, Miss Lopez.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.734
l just have not found the woman for me.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.569
What would this woman be like?

11:42.619 --> 11:45.704
My woman, Miss Lopez,

11:47.123 --> 11:50.459
must love the land as l do.

11:52.003 --> 11:55.214
More than all the gold in the world,

11:55.298 --> 12:00.260
she must find pleasure
in the scent of the cactus flower.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.056
She would sleep beneath the stars

12:05.100 --> 12:10.854
and let the wild west wind caress her body

12:10.980 --> 12:13.399
and blanket her soul.

12:14.609 --> 12:18.362
Her passions would be my passions,

12:18.530 --> 12:21.824
her dreams, my dreams.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.994
And our love would be a great song,

12:26.162 --> 12:28.914
and the song would be true.

12:38.049 --> 12:41.593
Armando is
a ridiculously hopeless romantic!

12:42.762 --> 12:46.723
What woman would sleep
in the dirt with him, please?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.308
Sonia.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.018
Come over here.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.276
Sonia.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.866
Father, l...

13:05.410 --> 13:10.164
Excuse me. Miss Lopez, Sonia and l,

13:10.290 --> 13:14.877
would like to ask your permission
to be married.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.296
To get married?

13:17.380 --> 13:20.799
You two? What a delight!

13:22.927 --> 13:27.973
The Lord has blessed the Alvarez house.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.225
Thank you!

13:31.186 --> 13:34.146
For Raul and for Sonia.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.647
Much happiness.

13:35.732 --> 13:40.819
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:40.945 --> 13:44.573
-For you, brother, cheers.
-Cheers.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.964
So it's true?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.843
lt says here that Raul is getting married
to this woman.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.178
lt's true.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.683
She is the most beautiful woman
l have ever seen.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.102
She is very pretty.

14:15.688 --> 14:19.107
You don't sound happy, Armando.

14:19.442 --> 14:22.528
Are you jealous of your brother?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.196
Jealous?

14:24.280 --> 14:28.784
No, Manuel, l could never be jealous of Raul.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.541
Maybe l love him too much,
and l am concerned.

14:35.625 --> 14:36.959
Concerned?

14:37.919 --> 14:39.211
l don't know.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.630
He has changed.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.550
l think you are jealous.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.468
l am jealous.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.930
lf l had a woman like this...

14:50.014 --> 14:52.391
l would never get out of bed.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.912
Can l not share in yourjoke?

15:16.499 --> 15:19.251
l'm afraid not, Miss Lopez.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.420
The joke was about you.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.464
Do you ride?

15:24.549 --> 15:26.592
l haven't in a long time,

15:26.718 --> 15:28.010
but l would like to.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.513
Esteban, please check on the herd.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.516
-l shall meet you there later.
-Of course.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.469
You ride well, Miss Lopez.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.056
Good control, nice poise.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.267
That is a difficult horse.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.894
You have ridden before.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.522
From the time l could walk,
my father put me on the back of a horse.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.399
l see.

16:24.609 --> 16:28.528
When l was nine,
my father was murdered in his bed.

16:28.613 --> 16:31.031
They took me to the city
to live with my uncle.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.324
lnteresting.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.493
My uncle was very mean.

16:34.577 --> 16:39.665
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me
and burned me with his cigarettes.

16:39.749 --> 16:40.957
lnteresting.

16:41.084 --> 16:44.586
l ran away from him when l was 1 2.

16:46.381 --> 16:50.008
But he found me, and beat me, and said
he would marry me when l was grown up.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.426
lnteresting.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.596
And your uncle?

16:55.765 --> 16:58.558
l have not seen him in a long time.

16:58.643 --> 17:01.687
l have to ask you something.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.480
Do you love Raul?

17:06.442 --> 17:10.278
Raul has been very good to me,
and l have been good to him.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.531
Do you love him?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.117
l must know.

17:18.663 --> 17:22.165
A race. l will show you how well l ride!
Giddy up!

17:23.417 --> 17:25.252
Not if l can help it!

17:53.906 --> 17:55.657
This is beautiful.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.326
What is this place?

17:58.995 --> 18:00.871
lt is called

18:00.955 --> 18:04.499
The Pond of the Seven Tears.

18:06.669 --> 18:10.255
l swam here as a boy.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.344
lt is the most beautiful spot
l have seen in all my life.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.848
How did you know to ride here?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.059
The wind told me.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.229
Sometimes the wind talks to me.

18:27.607 --> 18:32.110
This is the place my mother was killed.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.863
This was her favorite place.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.538
l have much work to do.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.957
Go then. l am only drying my hair.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.751
Okay, but do not be long.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.711
There are bandits in these hills.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.130
Armando will protect me.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.548
Yes.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.470
My son,

18:58.554 --> 19:00.722
this was my father's rifle.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.267
He passed it on to me when l was a boy,

19:04.352 --> 19:06.895
and today l am giving it to you.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.442
Go. You must build our ranch.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.411
Armando.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.414
What do you want?

19:26.958 --> 19:27.999
Armando, give me the gun.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.252
Boy, give me the gun!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.797
No! Let me go! No!

19:36.759 --> 19:38.510
Go! Don't touch me!

19:53.734 --> 19:56.820
She loved coming here.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.365
l am sorry.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.409
lt was a long time ago.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.246
l could stay here forever.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.958
l doubt that very much.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.377
Why is that?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.923
There is nothing to buy.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.550
No shops,

20:18.634 --> 20:20.510
no expensive clothes,

20:20.595 --> 20:22.470
no fancy shoes.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.558
This is not Dallas.

20:26.642 --> 20:28.435
ls that what you think of me?

20:28.519 --> 20:31.313
Someone who needs fancy shoes?

20:31.480 --> 20:35.442
lt does not matter what l think of you.

20:35.818 --> 20:40.280
You think l'm some kind of cheap woman
who is only interested in Raul's money?

20:40.364 --> 20:41.865
Are you?

20:47.121 --> 20:50.415
You never answered my question.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.417
What question?

20:52.501 --> 20:55.003
Do you love my brother?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.671
Take me back, now!

20:56.756 --> 20:58.798
Answer the question!

20:59.508 --> 21:01.009
Bongos!

21:01.093 --> 21:02.177
-Congas?
-Guns.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.511
Where?

21:03.596 --> 21:04.930
Over that hill.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.014
Hunters?

21:06.098 --> 21:07.849
Those are not hunters.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.143
Perhaps someone is hurt.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.103
lt is not our concern.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.857
You are a coward. A coward!

21:17.693 --> 21:18.693
Sonia!

21:20.655 --> 21:21.863
No!

21:35.962 --> 21:37.379
Sir? Sir?

21:38.089 --> 21:40.966
Please... God forgive me.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.637
Easy. We'll take you to the hospital.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.472
Let him die.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.724
He is missing a hand.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.726
Give me your water, Armando.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.270
Waste water on that?

21:54.689 --> 21:57.857
ln the trunk. lt's in the trunk.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.151
Take it...

22:03.990 --> 22:05.907
Here, take this.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.123
l know you.

22:13.207 --> 22:14.749
You are Sonia.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.501
l found some drugs!

22:16.585 --> 22:19.921
Armando, please help me put him
on the horse.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.425
He is coming.

22:23.551 --> 22:24.843
The Onza.

22:25.553 --> 22:31.266
Maybe God will be merciful.

22:34.645 --> 22:36.271
He is dead!

22:37.940 --> 22:40.608
He was dead a long time ago.

22:41.610 --> 22:45.321
lt looks like these belong to you now.

22:45.406 --> 22:47.615
You are a rich woman.

22:51.787 --> 22:54.039
Don't you want them?

22:54.123 --> 23:00.503
Perhaps as a wedding present
from an old dying friend?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.967
You have answered my question.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.470
You do not love my brother.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.102
Let me go. You're hurting me.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.813
l don't think you hurt so easily.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.734
l know the kind of woman you are.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.320
You know nothing about me.

23:25.404 --> 23:29.699
l know that you will not marry Raul
if l can help it.

23:31.827 --> 23:35.038
Do you think Raul is so innocent?

23:35.289 --> 23:37.123
You lie!

23:40.127 --> 23:42.087
You stupid rancher.

23:42.171 --> 23:45.131
Your brother is a drug dealer!

23:46.175 --> 23:49.052
You have done this!

23:49.136 --> 23:52.931
So help me God, if it is true,

23:53.015 --> 23:55.558
and my brother is involved in drugs,

23:55.684 --> 24:00.730
you shall never have the name Alvarez!

24:02.108 --> 24:04.442
l'll take care of my family.

24:04.527 --> 24:08.071
Let the devil take care of you.

24:22.211 --> 24:27.465
Are you so sure
that Raul is involved with drugs?

24:27.550 --> 24:29.592
l don't know, Manuel.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.805
l have sensed something since his return,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.933
and this morning with Sonia...

24:37.017 --> 24:40.562
Perhaps she is lying. Bitches are liars.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.149
lt is true. Bitches are liars.

24:44.233 --> 24:46.860
But Miss Lopez is no bitch.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.072
l like bitches.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.180
You two wait here
while l go and talk to Raul.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.032
lt is true, Raul?

25:34.575 --> 25:36.868
What are you speaking of, Armando?

25:36.994 --> 25:39.954
You are in the drug business.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.249
l am in business in Mexico, Armando.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.084
What's the difference?

25:45.252 --> 25:50.215
Raul, you have brought shame to our family.

25:50.299 --> 25:54.260
No, Armando. l am here to save this family.

25:54.345 --> 25:55.345
There's a difference.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.264
You are taking this family to hell!

26:03.812 --> 26:06.898
Armando, Little Armando, listen.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.151
Yes.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.903
So l move drugs over the border.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.072
So why do you care?

26:14.156 --> 26:16.241
l do not sell drugs to my people.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.493
l sell it to the Americans.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.870
l don't sell drugs to our people. No, no, no.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.165
l sell the Americans drugs, but l'd sell them
chocolates if they wanted them.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.833
But they don't!

26:26.710 --> 26:31.005
This is not the America
our father held in such high esteem.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.175
This is a country of babies.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.095
They buy houses with no money.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.889
TVs and cars with no money.

26:41.141 --> 26:45.144
They stuff their faces like monsters

26:45.271 --> 26:50.191
with shit burgers and grease.

26:50.693 --> 26:54.279
lt's irresponsible to feed candy to babies.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.948
No, they are not babies, Armando.

26:57.032 --> 27:00.034
They are all adults, and they are crazy.

27:01.537 --> 27:04.038
They only cry like babies.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.292
The damn Mexicans are coming!

27:07.376 --> 27:10.295
They are going to fuck us up
and kill us with their drugs!

27:10.379 --> 27:11.754
Fuck them!

27:12.548 --> 27:16.342
Fuck their drug-addicted children!

27:16.760 --> 27:18.136
Fuck them all.

27:18.220 --> 27:22.557
Fuck their heroin-addicted wives
who stuff themselves non-stop with pasta.

27:22.725 --> 27:26.352
Fuck their pot smoking doctors
from California.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.770
Fuck them!

27:28.772 --> 27:31.607
lf they can't stop themselves
from shoving bags of shit up their nose,

27:31.692 --> 27:33.735
then let's make a buck while we can,
Little Armando.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.404
Yes, yes. lf it was so simple.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.325
But instead we have been infected
with greed.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.827
We will all kill each other

27:42.911 --> 27:48.166
feeding the shit-eating
crazy monster babies.

27:48.500 --> 27:53.671
Look, Armando, this country will be strong

27:53.756 --> 27:56.549
from America's weakness.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.177
Sons of bitches.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.394
What's up?

28:10.814 --> 28:12.440
You are Raul?

28:13.817 --> 28:15.777
You know very well who l am.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.782
And l know very well who you are.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.412
Onza.

28:27.623 --> 28:28.998
The Onza.

28:33.420 --> 28:36.547
So, Raul, what the hell are you doing here?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.344
l am here visiting my family.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.680
l am here because...

28:49.395 --> 28:51.854
This is my land.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.197
You motherfucker,
you think you're a big boy?

29:01.281 --> 29:03.074
He's really funny. lsn't he, Armando?

29:03.158 --> 29:05.118
Look, Raul.

29:06.036 --> 29:07.912
l don't believe you.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.669
You have already taken my woman,

29:14.753 --> 29:17.505
and l think you are here for something more.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.216
The woman was never yours.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.301
-Oh, no?
-No.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.470
And l repeat.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.180
l am here...

29:27.683 --> 29:29.225
...because...

29:31.854 --> 29:34.480
...this is my land.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.573
Armando.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.450
Yes?

29:45.534 --> 29:48.327
Can l call you Little Armando?

29:48.412 --> 29:49.454
l'd like that.

29:51.582 --> 29:54.709
Do you know what your brother is doing?

29:55.878 --> 29:58.212
Do you know what business he is in?

30:02.009 --> 30:05.803
lt's very dangerous for you

30:05.888 --> 30:08.055
and very dangerous for him.

30:10.517 --> 30:13.186
And it's very dangerous for your family.

30:16.607 --> 30:18.316
Easy, easy.

30:18.901 --> 30:22.737
Not all dirty, little ranchers
like Canadian Slims.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.530
Yes, l like them.

30:27.743 --> 30:28.910
All right then,

30:28.994 --> 30:30.578
l only came to bring you this.

30:30.704 --> 30:32.830
l think it belongs to you.

30:32.915 --> 30:35.333
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.629
Raul.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.424
This is going to get very ugly.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.468
That's okay.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.470
Goodbye.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.096
See you around.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.307
See you later.

30:52.226 --> 30:53.309
Bye.

30:55.896 --> 30:58.105
-Bye bye.
-Bye.

31:25.300 --> 31:29.178
lt does not seem
as if this Onza wants to follow your plan.

31:33.016 --> 31:36.686
Armando, go home.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.858
Mexico is no place for cowards.

31:48.991 --> 31:53.411
l live my life on earth

31:53.537 --> 31:57.290
The dirt is all l know

31:57.374 --> 32:00.501
l am a ranchero

32:00.669 --> 32:04.880
And l know nothing

32:04.965 --> 32:09.885
l know nothing

32:16.685 --> 32:19.020
Why does the moon shine at night?

32:19.104 --> 32:21.689
l don't know

32:21.773 --> 32:24.108
Why does the bird take flight?

32:24.192 --> 32:26.902
l don't know

32:26.987 --> 32:29.113
Why does the turtle move so slow?

32:29.197 --> 32:31.365
l don't know

32:35.037 --> 32:36.037
Come on!

32:36.246 --> 32:38.122
Why do men hate each other?

32:38.206 --> 32:41.125
l don't know

32:41.209 --> 32:43.294
Why does the brother fight the brother?

32:43.378 --> 32:46.047
l don't know

32:46.131 --> 32:48.507
Why does the blue flower grow?

32:48.592 --> 32:51.010
l don't know

32:53.096 --> 32:59.518
How can l know anything?

32:59.603 --> 33:01.979
What is there to know?

33:02.064 --> 33:04.607
Long live Mexico!

33:04.691 --> 33:08.152
l am a man of the land

33:08.236 --> 33:12.406
l am a ranchero

33:12.532 --> 33:14.867
And l don't know

33:14.951 --> 33:17.411
l live a simple life

33:17.537 --> 33:19.664
l'm friends with the cows

33:19.748 --> 33:20.956
l have no thoughts

33:21.041 --> 33:23.918
l am a ranchero

33:45.649 --> 33:48.109
l don't know

33:50.654 --> 33:52.655
And l don't know

33:56.118 --> 33:58.619
Why is a woman so warm?

33:58.704 --> 34:01.414
Why is my bed so cold?

34:01.498 --> 34:03.749
These are the questions

34:03.834 --> 34:05.126
l'll never know

34:05.210 --> 34:07.545
l'm a ranchero

34:07.629 --> 34:12.091
And l don't know

34:12.175 --> 34:16.804
The only thing l'll ever know for certain

34:17.472 --> 34:24.478
ls love

34:57.179 --> 34:58.345
Look at that.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.977
Holy Mary, a white cat.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.188
This is a rare thing.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.108
Let me kill it.

35:11.485 --> 35:14.904
You cannot kill this.

35:15.071 --> 35:17.948
He is here for a reason.

35:18.033 --> 35:21.660
Yes, so that l can shoot him.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.288
l do not know the reason,

35:24.372 --> 35:27.541
but l believe it has something to do with me.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.979
Look at this country.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.483
Always such beauty.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.320
Why is there so much pain?

35:57.739 --> 36:00.491
Esteban slept on a rock last night.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.912
l slept on a bottle of tequila.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.086
What is this?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.170
l do not know.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.011
l don't like this.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.054
FEDERAL POLlCE

36:22.138 --> 36:23.973
You two stay here.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.601
Be careful.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.446
Armando Alvarez?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.324
Yes. That is my name.

36:42.784 --> 36:44.451
l am Vincent Blancardo.

36:45.245 --> 36:48.414
l was friend of your father's in the old days.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.166
You were the one who found my mother.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.961
Yes, many years ago.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.507
Armando, these men are from America.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.593
They are with the DEA.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.262
Yes, how can l help you?

37:15.317 --> 37:16.442
No, sir.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.527
l don't speak American.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.741
Armando, l need you to help me.

37:23.825 --> 37:24.950
Of course.

37:25.076 --> 37:29.997
We know that your brother is a drug dealer.

37:30.081 --> 37:37.046
We also know that he is here
to take over the territory of the Onza.

37:40.175 --> 37:43.302
l don't think l can help you, Mr...

37:43.386 --> 37:44.803
Parker.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.764
The name is Parker.

37:47.766 --> 37:51.477
l think you can help me.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.949
Listen, you piece of shit.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.951
l make one call,

38:07.035 --> 38:09.119
and l can get 1 0 helicopters

38:09.204 --> 38:11.956
to come up over that hill

38:12.040 --> 38:14.166
and turn your ranch

38:14.250 --> 38:16.001
into a lit fart.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.171
So you think about that.

38:34.437 --> 38:36.063
lt is better this way, Armando.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.439
Talk to Raul.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.442
Find out for this man.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.277
Now go find out.

39:19.649 --> 39:21.692
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:21.776 --> 39:25.821
l want to thank you all for coming today.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.992
Tomorrow will be a great day
for the Alvarez family.

39:30.076 --> 39:33.620
lt's a pleasure to share it with all of you.

39:34.372 --> 39:38.167
My sister, Carmen,
has come from Guadalajara.

39:38.501 --> 39:42.004
My other sister, Margarite,
has come from Puerto Vallarta.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.174
My cousin, Hernan, and his wife, Doleta.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.384
My friends for life.

39:48.136 --> 39:52.306
Of course, Sheila from Atlanta!

39:58.980 --> 40:01.732
Tomorrow will be a double celebration.

40:01.816 --> 40:06.653
The return of my son, Raul, to his land.

40:06.738 --> 40:10.199
Also, he brought home this precious woman

40:10.283 --> 40:13.077
with whom he gets to have sex.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.536
l propose a toast to Sonia.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.288
For Sonia! Friends.

40:16.790 --> 40:18.624
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

40:18.708 --> 40:19.708
For Sonia.

40:19.793 --> 40:21.043
Cheers!

40:21.127 --> 40:24.963
l'd also like to propose a toast

40:25.048 --> 40:28.050
and thank those who have come from so far.

40:28.676 --> 40:32.930
But l would like to specially thank someone,

40:33.014 --> 40:36.433
someone who many of you have often
called stupid, imbecile, fat head,

40:36.518 --> 40:40.270
but he's a guy with a big heart.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.439
l propose a toast

40:42.524 --> 40:44.441
for my brother.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.527
For your happiness, Armando.

40:54.869 --> 40:55.994
Well, Armando?

40:56.079 --> 41:00.040
You aren't going to toast
to your brother's happiness?

41:03.878 --> 41:05.087
Yes.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.883
To Raul's happiness.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.345
May you enjoy all of life's pleasure.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.391
Even if it means the destruction
of this family!

41:17.809 --> 41:18.809
Stop, Armando!

41:26.067 --> 41:27.818
Please!

41:27.902 --> 41:29.153
lt hurts me to say it,

41:29.237 --> 41:33.782
but tomorrow l do not wish
for you to be at your brother's wedding.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.118
Do you understand me? Get out!

41:39.205 --> 41:40.330
As you wish.

41:40.415 --> 41:41.748
-Armando...
-Let him go!

41:46.921 --> 41:47.921
Armando!

41:48.006 --> 41:49.923
Let me talk to him.
You stay with your guests.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.306
Armando.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.308
Go back inside, Sonia.

41:59.434 --> 42:00.809
Go back to your people.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.520
Don't make trouble, Armando.

42:03.605 --> 42:06.732
Do you think l like
that Raul is mixed up in this business?

42:06.816 --> 42:09.193
lt is your business too.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.777
We can change him.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.863
But l need your help.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.448
Armando,

42:14.532 --> 42:17.451
there's something you need to know.

42:18.912 --> 42:22.080
What is it that l must know?

42:22.165 --> 42:26.043
This drug dealer they call the Onza.

42:26.127 --> 42:30.214
He is my uncle.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.757
l understand.

42:32.759 --> 42:36.720
He will never stop until
he has what he wants.

42:36.804 --> 42:40.474
You come from trouble,
and you carry it with you.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.061
Then save us.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.145
Save your brother.

42:45.230 --> 42:46.563
Save your family.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.691
Save me.

42:50.985 --> 42:55.155
Some things are beyond saving.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.034
La

42:59.118 --> 43:00.702
La La

43:00.787 --> 43:03.830
La La La La La

43:07.085 --> 43:09.253
La

43:09.337 --> 43:10.879
La La

43:10.964 --> 43:14.049
La La La La La

43:14.175 --> 43:15.676
La La

43:17.470 --> 43:19.763
La

43:19.847 --> 43:23.350
La La

43:25.019 --> 43:30.524
La

45:41.656 --> 45:43.740
Father.

45:43.825 --> 45:46.993
Raul, who did this? Was it Armando?

45:47.078 --> 45:48.161
Easy, Dad, don't talk.

45:50.540 --> 45:52.332
Don't die on me.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.171
Armando was right.

46:00.216 --> 46:02.759
He was dead the day we came to his house.

46:02.844 --> 46:06.096
Hold on, Papa...
Hold on, you're gonna be fine.

46:06.180 --> 46:08.640
lt has his fingerprints all over it!

46:08.724 --> 46:09.766
What?

46:09.851 --> 46:11.560
lt had to be Armando!

46:11.644 --> 46:13.603
How the hell could it be Armando, Papa?

46:47.388 --> 46:48.805
Hello, Blancardo...

46:48.890 --> 46:50.682
The deed is done.

46:51.184 --> 46:53.602
Sonia?

46:53.728 --> 46:56.646
She is alive, just as you wanted.

46:56.731 --> 46:58.023
Good.

46:58.107 --> 46:59.316
Raul?

47:00.902 --> 47:03.236
Raul still lives.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.280
So let me get this right...

47:05.406 --> 47:09.910
l'm paying the police to protect me.

47:09.994 --> 47:13.163
Do the police not honor
their obligations anymore?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.581
Don't worry.

47:15.208 --> 47:18.668
He will come to you now.

47:18.836 --> 47:22.255
We must figure out how to bring him back.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.759
The woman.

47:26.427 --> 47:28.428
His woman.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.430
Sonia.

47:30.598 --> 47:32.224
Little Sonia.

47:32.433 --> 47:35.352
My little niece.

47:35.436 --> 47:36.770
Fine. Thank you.

47:50.785 --> 47:52.953
Whoa, stop! Hey, Armando!

47:53.037 --> 47:54.829
Esteban, my friend.
Why are you in such a hurry?

47:54.914 --> 47:56.122
They shot your father!

47:56.207 --> 47:57.207
What?

47:57.291 --> 47:59.251
The wedding! Gunmen shooting!

47:59.335 --> 48:00.335
Raul?

48:00.419 --> 48:01.545
Raul and the woman are safe.

48:01.629 --> 48:05.507
Your father, Armando.
Your father is dying.

48:05.591 --> 48:06.716
Let's go!

48:06.968 --> 48:08.218
Fast!

48:22.900 --> 48:26.319
Armando, come.

48:26.654 --> 48:28.029
Yes, Father?

48:28.114 --> 48:29.823
lt is me.

48:32.118 --> 48:34.202
Do you remember your mother?

48:34.328 --> 48:35.745
Yes.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.664
l remember her a little.

48:37.790 --> 48:41.209
She was a very beautiful woman.

48:41.335 --> 48:44.879
She was a beautiful woman.

48:44.964 --> 48:48.300
The most beautiful in all of Mexico.

48:48.384 --> 48:51.886
You know, you have her eyes.

48:52.013 --> 48:55.390
You have told me that many times.

48:55.516 --> 48:59.936
The eyes of a small chicken.

49:00.021 --> 49:01.980
Little chicken...

49:03.441 --> 49:06.693
l have been very mean to you.

49:07.653 --> 49:10.488
Calling you stupid all the time,

49:10.573 --> 49:15.160
comparing you to donkeys and pigs,

49:15.870 --> 49:19.122
laughing at the way you speak.

49:20.207 --> 49:25.462
Giving you to the circus.

49:26.088 --> 49:32.761
Perhaps l have never forgiven you

49:32.970 --> 49:36.181
for the accident.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.392
For this, l am very sorry.

49:40.394 --> 49:42.562
l was hoping,

49:42.647 --> 49:47.359
when l see your mother in heaven,

49:48.069 --> 49:51.071
l could tell her that her home,

49:51.155 --> 49:56.201
and her family are well.

49:57.536 --> 50:01.081
What will l say now, Armando?

50:03.501 --> 50:07.587
You must tell her a lie.

50:08.464 --> 50:13.718
Tell her Raul has married
a beautiful woman,

50:13.803 --> 50:17.764
and that she will have children

50:17.848 --> 50:22.644
and the Alvarez family is known

50:22.728 --> 50:28.066
throughout Mexico as an honorable family.

50:30.903 --> 50:34.447
l will tell her a lie.

50:36.158 --> 50:42.831
Because l am ashamed
of the truth, Armando.

50:46.377 --> 50:51.631
l am ashamed.

50:59.306 --> 51:05.979
Father...

51:12.695 --> 51:15.780
l will kill the motherfucker
responsible for it.

51:16.115 --> 51:19.033
He was not killed by any man.

51:19.118 --> 51:22.620
He died of shame.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.165
lt's Sonia.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.208
She has taken one of the horses.

51:28.502 --> 51:33.214
Find Esteban and look for her, Armando.

51:33.299 --> 51:34.340
Please.

51:35.384 --> 51:38.636
l can help you look for your woman.

51:38.721 --> 51:42.932
But after she has been found,
dead or alive,

51:43.017 --> 51:45.310
that is the last you will see of me.

53:10.688 --> 53:16.693
Do you think the water will
wash off your shame?

53:17.945 --> 53:20.405
Leave me alone, Armando.

53:20.489 --> 53:24.200
l forbid you to swim in this place.

53:24.285 --> 53:27.537
lt is sacred to me.

53:29.081 --> 53:30.665
Swim?

53:30.749 --> 53:31.916
No.

53:32.251 --> 53:35.712
l cannot swim.

53:35.796 --> 53:38.673
No one ever taught me how to swim.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.894
Sonia...

54:05.326 --> 54:10.663
Sonia!

54:19.048 --> 54:22.342
Please, Armando, l don't want to live.

54:22.509 --> 54:24.510
You would kill yourself?

54:24.637 --> 54:28.556
You are a fool!

54:28.641 --> 54:30.266
l cannot live.

54:30.351 --> 54:33.645
Don't you know there is no escape for me?

54:33.729 --> 54:40.610
You knew what you were getting into
when you came with Raul.

54:41.028 --> 54:45.031
Yes. Yes, l knew.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.325
He talked of living on this ranch,

54:47.409 --> 54:52.622
and said everything would be different.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.540
And you believed him?

54:54.667 --> 54:55.917
Yes.

54:56.001 --> 54:56.960
No.

54:57.044 --> 55:00.338
l don't know...

55:00.422 --> 55:03.758
Please, Armando...

55:04.009 --> 55:07.887
Leave me alone.
Raul does not need me.

55:09.431 --> 55:12.225
l have not come for Raul.

55:12.476 --> 55:14.686
l have come for you.

55:14.853 --> 55:16.479
Armando...

55:16.563 --> 55:20.024
l am no good!

55:20.109 --> 55:23.778
l am no better!

57:15.599 --> 57:17.934
Look at them.

57:18.018 --> 57:21.646
So peaceful.

57:27.486 --> 57:32.365
l thought you said this was Raul's woman?

57:32.491 --> 57:34.450
She does not look like Raul's woman to me.

57:34.535 --> 57:36.494
This is Raul's woman.

57:36.578 --> 57:40.039
Sonia, why are you sleeping
with this dirty rancher?

57:40.165 --> 57:41.624
Please, Uncle...

57:41.708 --> 57:44.043
Well, whatever makes you happy.

57:44.169 --> 57:47.046
Maybe Raul has no dick.

57:48.048 --> 57:52.176
Lately l've been enjoying
all these dick jokes.

57:53.720 --> 57:55.721
What is it that you want?

57:55.806 --> 57:58.975
This is the land of my father.

57:59.059 --> 58:01.144
You are trespassing.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.479
No, we aren't trespassing.

58:03.564 --> 58:09.610
lt is you who is trespassing
on your brother's woman.

58:10.362 --> 58:12.029
That's a good one too!

58:12.114 --> 58:15.116
Leave us alone.

58:15.868 --> 58:18.536
No.

58:18.745 --> 58:19.996
Take her.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.207
We will see if Raul wants her back.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.503
Stay away!

58:27.713 --> 58:30.089
Or l'll beat you with these hands!

58:30.257 --> 58:34.218
No, no, no. l didn't come to fight.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.554
Kill him.

58:37.264 --> 58:41.809
lt is fitting that you should die
where your mother died.

58:41.894 --> 58:44.353
lf you had only let me rape her,

58:44.438 --> 58:46.772
she would not have died that day.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.360
You.

58:51.445 --> 58:53.863
Kiss your mother for me, Armando.

58:59.620 --> 59:00.995
You coward!

59:01.079 --> 59:02.747
Hold on, the gun is still hot.

59:02.831 --> 59:04.540
Shut up!

59:07.294 --> 59:09.712
No.

59:09.796 --> 59:12.965
Let the coyotes take him.

59:13.175 --> 59:17.970
We must save our bullets for the brother.

59:29.441 --> 59:31.817
Let's go.

59:41.328 --> 59:43.079
Do not underestimate Raul.

59:44.081 --> 59:50.753
Raul was foolish to come into my territory.

59:51.838 --> 59:54.882
He will lose everything,

59:54.967 --> 59:57.593
including you.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:56.003
l am Yik'in Chan Kwawiil.

01:01:56.088 --> 01:01:58.422
The one that darkens the sky.

01:01:58.507 --> 01:02:01.217
The Jaguar King of the mountain.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:04.261
You know me as the Onza.

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:07.306
Yourjourney has only nowjust begun.

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:10.476
lt is the time for your vision!

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:24.031
Mexico is no place for cowards.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.741
Save your brother.

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:27.076
Save your family.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.828
Save me.

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:43.801
Kiss your mother for me.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:04.780
l have hidden inside the mountains,

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:09.368
and you have hidden inside yourself.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:12.997
The hiding place is irrelevant

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:18.169
when the hidden hide for no reason.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:42.776
l will not be struck!

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:47.406
By man or beast!

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.617
l am Armando Alvarez!

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:50.868
Again!

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:53.662
l am Armando Alvarez!

01:03:53.747 --> 01:03:55.080
One more time.

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:58.334
l am Armando Alvarez!

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:00.628
Good.

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.380
l am

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.008
Armando Alvarez.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.771
He has Sonia.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:22.441
Good. l knew you would go with me.

01:04:22.526 --> 01:04:23.692
No, Raul.

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.277
l'll go alone for her.

01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:28.239
Little Armando...

01:04:30.325 --> 01:04:32.326
Don't be a fool.

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:37.331
l have been a fool for too long.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:51.220
Hello, this is the Onza.
How can l help you?

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.097
He has assembled a small army.

01:04:53.682 --> 01:04:55.224
Let him come.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.142
l am ready for him.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:00.604
Just keep the Americans away.

01:05:00.689 --> 01:05:03.315
They want nothing to do with this.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.192
They want you to kill each other.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:07.486
Good.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.238
After l kill Raul,

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.283
l will kill those fucking Americans.

01:05:12.367 --> 01:05:13.492
Okay?

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.577
All right.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.370
Bye.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:22.918
This Onza is such a fucking coward!

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:26.130
Does he think he can come
into my house uninvited?

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:28.591
Does he think he can take any woman?

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.301
No!

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:34.555
l'm not going to let him kill
any more of my own flesh and blood!

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:38.434
This is the end of that fucking Onza!

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:39.810
You know what?

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:42.688
We won't allow him to fuck it up again!

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:47.109
This fucking Onza is done!

01:05:56.995 --> 01:06:03.959
You will see that your uncle can provide you
with all that Raul promised,

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:08.130
and much more.

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.549
You're so beautiful.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.885
Thank you.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.805
Bitch!

01:06:19.059 --> 01:06:21.935
No one is coming for you.

01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:23.312
He will come.

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:24.813
And he will kill you.

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:27.900
Raul?

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.069
l do not speak of Raul.

01:06:33.782 --> 01:06:36.492
Are you referring to that filthy rancher?

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:37.660
Yes.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:41.246
Little niece, you are a fool.

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:43.332
l told you a million times, l killed him.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.501
He is dead.

01:06:45.585 --> 01:06:50.005
The wind tells me he is not.

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.372
l'm jumping!

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.674
The one they call the Onza.

01:08:57.759 --> 01:09:00.093
My name is Armando Alvarez.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:03.846
l am talking to you, Onza!

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:05.599
l'm surprised to see you alive.

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:08.100
l want the girl.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.729
Let her go and the two of us will leave.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.776
l can kill you now with one shot.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:19.238
l am only giving you this one chance.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:23.575
Release the woman and l will let you live.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.341
Armando, stay there.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.432
Do you have a cigarette?

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:31.476
Yes.

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:40.235
What the fuck, Armando?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.696
You never learned how to roll a cigarette.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:45.198
l am sorry.

01:10:53.583 --> 01:10:58.670
Damn it. l'm dying
and you're giving me this piece of shit?

01:11:01.925 --> 01:11:05.052
l'm sorry.

01:11:05.136 --> 01:11:06.094
Brother.

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:08.972
Yes?

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:12.601
She loves you.

01:11:13.937 --> 01:11:15.979
l just realized this.

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:19.858
Go and get her.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:24.196
Damn, our father would have loved
to have seen that.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.781
Go. Go get her.

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:31.161
lt's over.

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:32.412
l'm going to meet father now.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:33.455
Stay here.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.539
No.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.624
Please.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:41.630
Mexico will be a better place without me.

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.049
lt's time.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:47.821
l am Armando Alvarez.

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:50.198
l have come for your life.

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:52.743
How dare you come in like that.

01:12:52.827 --> 01:12:56.038
Just like that, without an invitation?

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.457
You invited me when you took my woman.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.459
You want her?

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:01.752
Here you go!

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.245
And now,

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.997
you both shall die!

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:40.999
Armando!

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:27.337
Oh, damn it.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:31.633
l always thought that

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:34.719
when this moment arrived

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:39.224
there would be a lot of people.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.394
A lot of TV networks.

01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:45.021
Police.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:49.985
The army, the president, and everything...

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:56.825
l won't be there, l won't be able to see it.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.915
Oh, shit.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:15:58.970
Armando Alvarez.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.890
You are under arrest for murder

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:04.017
and the trafficking of illegal drugs.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:07.229
You will be extradited to the United States,

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.855
where you will stand trial.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.149
No, Mr. Blancardo,

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:13.318
there will be no trial.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.737
-For my mother.
-You son of a bitch!

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:46.601
You are out of luck, wetback.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:17:01.116
Not all Americans are bad, Armando.

01:17:06.247 --> 01:17:11.126
Not all Mexicans are drug dealers.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:14.921
Are you ready, Sonia?

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:16.256
Yes.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.591
Let's go home.

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:24.848
Bye.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:37.444
Do you want to walk?

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.913
With every season comes a change

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:16.418
A season ends and a new one comes

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:20.797
But now a season has come to us

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:25.176
lt's a no good season

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:30.056
A bird has wings so he can fly

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:34.644
His home is up in the sky

01:19:35.521 --> 01:19:39.607
His home is where his heart can sing

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:43.820
Unless he has a broken wing

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:51.286
My whole life has been a struggle

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:55.999
l've chased a dream within a bubble

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:59.669
And now that dream is fading slow

01:19:59.753 --> 01:20:06.301
l've made a world only l can know

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:12.974
ls this the end of what we are?

01:20:13.851 --> 01:20:17.687
What we were is long ago

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:22.525
l will not let this come to pass

01:20:22.610 --> 01:20:27.238
My name is Armando Alvarez

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:31.409
ls there a world where love is free?

01:20:32.119 --> 01:20:36.080
A world where love was meant for me

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:42.545
Must l always fight for love?

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:23.378
l will save my family

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:27.799
From this greed and tyranny

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:32.470
God will help me from above

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.182
Must l always

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:40.395
l will definitely

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:48.444
Fight for love!

01:21:57.871 --> 01:21:59.789
ARMANDO
AND SONlA

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:02.041
visions of love
