WEBVTT

01:28.630 --> 01:29.790
Yuck.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.006
The fire's still warm.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.974
Is that you, hermit Bob?

01:44.521 --> 01:46.512
We kinda can see you.

01:47.524 --> 01:51.062
Farmer Miller says you might have
stole one of his chickens.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.644
That happens to be
against the law.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.907
Now, I'm hoping that it was
a fox that did that.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.282
Up your hole
with a wooden pole, cliff.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.204
That also happens to be
against the law.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.505
Should we take him in?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.674
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.061
I don't see him.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.401
Uh, we're gonna go back
to town now...

02:36.448 --> 02:37.563
Hermit Bob.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.156
Don't break any more laws.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.818
Just calm down.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.718
Hey, cliff.

03:02.557 --> 03:03.672
Fuck you.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.085
J oh, the dead don't die &

03:38.969 --> 03:41.961
j any more than you or I §

03:42.681 --> 03:46.139
j they're just ghosts
inside a dream j

03:47.144 --> 03:50.102
j of a life that we don't own &

03:50.939 --> 03:54.352
j they walk around us all the time j

03:55.360 --> 03:58.477
j never paying any mind &

03:59.448 --> 04:02.315
j to the silly lives we lead j

04:03.452 --> 04:06.444
j or the reaping we've all sown j

04:07.581 --> 04:10.539
j there's a cup of coffee waiting j

04:10.625 --> 04:13.162
j on every corner j

04:15.922 --> 04:18.664
js someday we're gonna wake up j

04:19.426 --> 04:22.418
j and find the corners gone j

04:23.597 --> 04:27.556
j but the dead will still be
walking round &

04:28.018 --> 04:30.509
j in this old world alone j

04:31.605 --> 04:34.847
j well, after life is over &

04:35.734 --> 04:38.771
j the afterlife goes on &

04:39.654 --> 04:42.896
j well, after life is over &

04:43.825 --> 04:50.412
j the afterlife goes on &

05:04.971 --> 05:07.303
Should we bring him in
one of these days?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.176
I mean...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.767
He fired a weapon at police officers.

05:15.690 --> 05:16.975
Yeah, I don't know.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.066
I doubt he even stole
that chicken.

05:22.531 --> 05:25.819
Farmer Miller
is such an asshole.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.452
I've known Bob
since junior high.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.532
Oh, wow. That must have
been, like, 50 years ago.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.163
Yeah, it was.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.420
You know,
Bob's been out there for years,

05:40.507 --> 05:42.213
eating squirrels and bugs,

05:42.300 --> 05:45.292
and he never hurt anyone
that I ever heard of.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.260
Well, he is kind of unusual.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.972
Is it already 20 after 8:007

05:56.147 --> 05:58.263
shouldn't it be
getting dark by now?

05:58.358 --> 06:02.146
Yeah, this daylight savings thing
is all out of whack lately.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.694
Damn it.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.441
My watch stopped.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.694
Or is broken or something.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.870
Yeah, something weird's going on.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.206
Yeah. Weird.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.260
Yeah, this isn't gonna
end well, cliff.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.908
The ant colonies.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.579
All jacked up like it was
the end of the world.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.555
Hey, Ronnie, you want
to swing by the diner,

07:18.647 --> 07:20.979
get some doughnuts, coffee?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.774
Um... no, thanks.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.189
It seems late for coffee
and doughnuts.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.775
I guess so.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.366
This is home base.
Are you guys reading me? Over.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.371
- Hey, mindy.
- You guys okay out there?

07:38.458 --> 07:42.326
Yeah, we're just, uh, cruising a bit
before we swing on back.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.911
Uh, you need anything?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.877
We could, uh, run by the diner,

07:47.968 --> 07:49.458
pick you up some coffee
and doughnuts.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.551
Negative. Thanks.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.588
There is something strange
going on, though.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.494
Have you guys, by any chance,
noticed that the...

07:56.518 --> 07:58.679
And the daylight and the...

07:58.770 --> 08:00.623
I think the news report...

08:02.273 --> 08:03.479
Hello, hello?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.686
Shit. We lost her.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.942
Use your cell.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.532
That's funny.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.701
It's completely dead.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.041
And it was fully charged.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.709
Hey, cliff, should we listen
to the civilian radio?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.085
Sure. Go ahead.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.095
J oh, the dead don't die &

08:40.311 --> 08:42.302
j any more than you or I... &

08:42.397 --> 08:44.058
wow, that sounds so familiar.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.266
J they're just ghosts inside a dream... j

08:48.820 --> 08:50.230
what is that song, Ronnie?

08:51.364 --> 08:52.900
It's "the dead don't die."

08:53.783 --> 08:55.239
By sturgill Simpson.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.950
Sturgill Simpson?

09:01.499 --> 09:03.285
Why does it sound so familiar?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.959
Well, 'cause it's the theme song.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.081
The theme song? Yeah.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.540
J there's a cup of coffee waiting j

09:11.634 --> 09:14.592
j on every comer j

09:16.806 --> 09:19.798
js someday we're gonna wake up j

09:20.727 --> 09:23.719
j and find the corners gone j

09:24.731 --> 09:28.770
j but the dead will still be
walking round &

09:29.277 --> 09:31.859
j in this old world alone j

09:32.739 --> 09:36.231
j well, after life is over &

09:36.785 --> 09:40.198
j the afterlife goes on &

09:48.922 --> 09:52.085
J there'll be old friends
walking round &

09:53.176 --> 09:56.043
j in a somewhat familiar town j

09:56.930 --> 10:02.425
j that you saw once
when you looked up from the phone j

10:05.021 --> 10:08.229
5 nobody bothers saying hi j

10:09.567 --> 10:12.479
j and you can save
all your goodbyes &

10:13.321 --> 10:16.438
j stop trying to pretend &

10:17.659 --> 10:19.945
j that we're all not at home... &

10:20.036 --> 10:22.618
how much longer until
my takeout's ready, fern?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.788
Be out shortly, frank.
Just heating it up for you.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.325
Would you mind turning off
that goddamn music?

10:30.255 --> 10:32.120
Fucking sturgill Simpson.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.671
Sure thing.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.637
So, frank,
what makes you so sure

10:41.724 --> 10:44.932
it's hermit Bob
who stole your chicken?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.510
Well, who the hell else
could it be?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.975
That goddamn hairy lunatic,

10:50.066 --> 10:52.853
living out there
all these years like a caveman.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.976
Like some kind of ghost.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.278
Might as well be amish.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.025
Maybe it was a... a fox, frank.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.035
Um, I don't think
Bob ever hurt anybody.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.579
Yeah, well, tell that
to my fucking chickens.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.828
Fox, my ass.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.119
Here you go, frank.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.921
Want me to put that
in a to-go cup for you?

11:16.092 --> 11:18.834
Nah, I can't drink
any more of that stuff.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.385
It's too damn black for me.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.759
I meant it's too strong.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.185
Take care, frank.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.360
Yeah.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.648
This special report:

11:41.743 --> 11:44.155
These activities
could possibly be affecting

11:44.245 --> 11:46.327
the earth's rotation on its axis.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.201
Scientists say even
the slightest change in this balance

11:51.836 --> 11:54.248
in our usual hours of daylight.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.920
Meanwhile, government officials,

11:56.007 --> 11:59.090
as well as the heads of
the energy companies involved,

11:59.177 --> 12:01.668
say the recent extensive
polar fracking

12:01.763 --> 12:05.221
has had no discernible
consequences whatsoever.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.640
Here's what
the energy secretary had to say

12:07.727 --> 12:09.433
in this evening's press conference.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.388
Listen,
these alarmists are dangerous liars.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.143
Let's not believe something

12:15.235 --> 12:18.602
just because one so-called scientist
says it's true.

12:18.696 --> 12:21.483
Polar fracking has created
fantastic jobs,

12:21.574 --> 12:24.156
big profits and energy
for our great country.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.284
Let's not forget our priori...

12:27.497 --> 12:28.737
What you think, fern?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.780
I don't know, Hank.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.783
Shouldn't it be getting dark out?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.448
So, you can see from this diagram

12:44.472 --> 12:48.056
that if the earth is pulled
even slightly off its axis,

12:48.142 --> 12:50.007
the repercussions could be extreme.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.020
Coming up in the next segment...

12:53.523 --> 12:55.980
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.900
A change in the earth's
rotation or its spin rate?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.315
That'd be catastrophic,
for sure.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.397
All the cycles of the biosphere
would be affected.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.653
The natural cycles of sunlight
would be disrupted,

13:06.744 --> 13:09.076
plants wouldn't grow,
wind patterns would change,

13:09.163 --> 13:10.619
and tectonic activity...

13:11.666 --> 13:12.746
Forget about it.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.412
The polar caps shifting
would mean...

13:17.880 --> 13:19.040
I don't want to say.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.877
Total planetary destruction.

13:22.719 --> 13:23.879
For real?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.305
Shut up.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.012
Okay, time's up, girls. Way up.

13:36.232 --> 13:39.599
Well, if it isn't Geronimo
on the girls' floor again.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.726
Do you want to be a girl,
Geronimo?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.398
No.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.980
Well, then get back
to the boys' section. Now.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.362
Dennis.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.454
Can you please escort Geronimo
back to the boys' section?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.532
I'll deal with these girls.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.791
Let's go, Geronimo.
You know the drill.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.792
Let's go, you clowns.
It's bedtime for bozos.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.298
You two ladies, too. Let's go.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.333
Secretary of energy pillerton, however,

14:10.600 --> 14:12.932
fully refutes these speculations,
insisting...

14:17.774 --> 14:19.585
See you, Bobby.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.440
- Excellent.
- You got it? Need a bag?

14:21.527 --> 14:22.767
- No, thanks.
- All right.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.648
- Bye, Bobby.
- See you guys.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.479
Wow, it's still so light out.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.485
Okay. So...

14:45.343 --> 14:47.379
- Bilbo Baggins.
- Hey, Dean.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.802
- What's up, buddy?
- How's things?

14:49.889 --> 14:53.427
After-hours delivery, wu-ps.
Check this out.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.929
Got some
weird news of the world.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.429
The earth off its axis.

15:00.525 --> 15:01.890
That's bad news.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.652
This is for you right here,
for your collection.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.197
Oh, man. Starlog.

15:13.913 --> 15:14.913
Eerie.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.373
Creepy, number 61.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.576
April 1974.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.377
Oh, man. Here, let me
give you some money.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.674
No, that's on me.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.586
- Add it to your collection.
- Thanks, man.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.592
Just give me
your herbie hancock right here,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.514
and I'll be on my way.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.851
They need to fix the ac.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.179
You know, it's kind of hot
in this motherfucker, huh?

15:41.983 --> 15:43.268
All right.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.849
Okay-dokay.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.935
All right,
see you next week, Frodo.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.323
Hey, Dean.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.318
I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind just, uh,

15:55.830 --> 15:58.822
dropping a little wisdom
until the next delivery.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.868
The world is perfect.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.419
Appreciate the details.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.559
"The world is perfect.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.433
Appreciate the details."

16:29.071 --> 16:30.982
You guys shouldn't be here.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.118
Strange.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.167
Tasty porcinis.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.928
Okay.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.233
Mmm.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.886
Kitty!

17:15.910 --> 17:18.401
Good evening.
This is posie juarez.

17:18.496 --> 17:23.286
We interrupt this program for
a Centerville 7 news special report.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.617
People are saying their pets
have either just disappeared

17:26.712 --> 17:30.330
or are acting unusually
skittish and aggressive.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.164
Here's a report from harrisville.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.046
Look at this.

17:40.601 --> 17:44.139
And when [ Finally did find her,
she was under the house.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.524
She's very gentle and...

17:51.279 --> 17:53.520
That's so strange.
Where are you guys?

17:54.740 --> 17:57.777
And she had
this wild look in her eye.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.196
And when I finally tried
to pull her out,

18:00.288 --> 18:04.531
she scratched me all to shreds,
like a wild animal.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.583
That's so creepy. I knew...

18:08.170 --> 18:09.250
We're back?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.420
Hello.

18:11.507 --> 18:15.341
Wow, that is strange, and it seems
to be happening all over.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.214
We'll have more reports at 11:00.

18:17.847 --> 18:21.055
But for now, this is posie juarez
for Centerville 7 news.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.473
Stay safe...

18:22.560 --> 18:23.845
And keep your eyes open.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.094
Rumsfeld.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.602
Rumsfeld. Here, boy.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.059
Where the hell are you?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.775
Goddamn dog.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.654
Rumsfeld? You out here?

18:48.085 --> 18:50.576
Rumsfeld, what you doing over there?
Get your ass inside.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.711
Come on, stupid.

18:57.261 --> 18:58.467
Hey.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.220
What are you doing?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.009
Goddamn it.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.809
Holy shit.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.562
Who stole my fucking cows?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.482
Where the hell are my chickens?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.745
Frank's cows.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.410
Into the woods, ladies.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.039
Welcome to my world.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.929
Damn it, Mallory.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.145
Even dead, you reek of chardonnay.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.226
Cheap chardonnay.

20:00.282 --> 20:04.867
- How's she looking?
- Well, she's not getting any older.

20:07.164 --> 20:11.407
Wow. The diner sure makes
the world's best coffee, doesn't it?

20:12.628 --> 20:14.459
Yeah, but how can you
drink it so late?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.505
- Won't it keep you up?
- No, I sleep like a baby.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.819
Except maybe when I know there's
a corpse waiting for me at work.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.418
Oh, yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.009
Cliff, is the coroner from latrobe
gonna pick her up tomorrow?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.328
It's getting a little creepy
being here alone

20:28.352 --> 20:30.468
with Mallory decomposing in there.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.596
Yeah, they're supposed to come
pick her up tomorrow morning.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.522
Thank god.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.146
I don't know why she can't be
over at the funeral home.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.525
'Cause she's going
to Potter's field in latrobe.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.532
And 'cause our new,
unusual undertaker,

20:45.619 --> 20:49.237
Ms. Winston,
has got those two golfers

20:49.331 --> 20:51.413
that were struck by lightning...
The logans.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.798
Thanks, Ronnie.
It's not really necessary, but...

21:04.889 --> 21:06.925
Can I, uh,
drive you home, mindy?

21:07.016 --> 21:10.053
Also not necessary, Ronnie.
You know I have my car here.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.801
Oh, yeah.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.308
- How is the prius running?
- Fine.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.631
Can you even fit two people
in that little smart car of yours?

21:17.777 --> 21:20.393
Well, yeah. Holds two nicely.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.063
This daylight thing
is bothering me.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.194
It's strange.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.694
Well, what can I say?
The world is kind of strange lately.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.654
Yeah, it sure is.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.786
If you ask me, this whole thing
is gonna end badly.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.038
So, what exactly
do you mean, Ronnie?

21:40.841 --> 21:43.127
Oh, uh, don't know.

21:43.219 --> 21:46.256
Just a feeling, I guess.
Strong feeling.

21:46.806 --> 21:47.921
Oh, boy.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.090
You okay doing the whole
night shift alone, cliff?

21:51.894 --> 21:53.350
Yeah, I can take a nap.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.053
I mean, I can just lie down
in that other cell

21:57.024 --> 21:58.480
next to old Mallory.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.061
Oh, god.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.484
Next to her... her dead body?

22:05.241 --> 22:07.323
Might bring back some old memories.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.572
See you guys tomorrow.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.625
- See you, cliff.
- Yeah, see you tomorrow, chief.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.251
"This is all gonna end badly."

22:25.052 --> 22:26.383
What does that mean?

22:29.056 --> 22:32.048
I knew Mallory o'brien
since I was a kid.

22:32.142 --> 22:36.511
And believe it or not,
she was a pretty young thing, too.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.096
Please.

22:39.900 --> 22:43.563
Sorry, but good riddance
to that drunken old goat.

22:43.654 --> 22:45.315
Well, I... I don't know, fern.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.655
Jeez, I got to get up out of here.

22:49.326 --> 22:52.659
I got to, uh, get to the hardware store
early tomorrow morning.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.830
I'm looking forward
to seeing you ladies tomorrow.

22:56.917 --> 22:59.784
- Take care, Hank.
- Good night, Hank. Sweet dreams.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.983
Hank is such a gentleman.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.417
Sure is.

23:05.676 --> 23:09.339
Well, I better
get started cleaning here.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.760
Listen, Lily. I've been dying to ask you
about that new foreign woman

23:13.851 --> 23:17.014
that took over the funeral home.
What's her name?

23:17.104 --> 23:20.688
Her name is Zelda Winston.
And she's strange, for sure.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.890
And she's got these, like,
really weird eyes,

23:22.985 --> 23:24.896
like she's, like,
looking right through you.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.228
She pays me really well, though.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.777
Zelda. What kind of name is that?

23:30.868 --> 23:34.201
I don't know. She's probably, like,
Irish or Scottish or whatever.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.850
And she talks really funny, though,
so I don't always get it right.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.115
But I like the name Zelda.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.998
It reminds me of, um,
Zelda Fitzgerald.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.503
Who's that?

23:46.216 --> 23:48.047
That's great gatsby's wife.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.418
And who's that?

23:50.512 --> 23:53.379
That's the really rich guy
from the 1920s.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.430
The Robert redford guy.

23:57.186 --> 23:59.097
Well, anyway,
so what's it like over there

23:59.188 --> 24:01.850
in those secret rooms
since she took over?

24:01.941 --> 24:05.684
Well, there's these, like,
really creepy back rooms,

24:05.778 --> 24:07.860
you know, where they, like,
keep all the stiffs.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.906
And then next to that,
there's this big golden Buddha.

24:11.992 --> 24:15.200
- A what, now?
- There's a big, shiny, golden Buddha.

24:15.287 --> 24:19.326
And then there's these, like,
old-looking samurai swords on a rack.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.616
Really?

26:05.773 --> 26:07.354
Amituofo.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.783
Well, that's peculiar.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.208
Now, stay put, will you?

27:22.850 --> 27:24.215
What is it, Liv?

27:26.353 --> 27:27.433
You okay?

27:28.397 --> 27:31.230
Yeah. I guess so.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.484
I just got this creepy feeling.

27:36.113 --> 27:38.445
You were probably just
having a bad dream.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.030
Yeah, guess so.

27:41.743 --> 27:43.108
A bad dream.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.487
It's okay.
Just go back to sleep.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.199
Thanks, stell.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.236
Hmm. Toxic lunar vibrations.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.049
All right, honey, I'm done.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.255
I'm leaving your money here.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.179
I'm out of here, lil.

29:32.271 --> 29:33.681
Okay, fern. See you tomorrow.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.854
Not if I see you first.

29:35.941 --> 29:37.101
Very funny.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.191
Excuse me, we're closed.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.109
What... what happened to you?

29:41.196 --> 29:43.528
Aah! Lily!

29:48.870 --> 29:51.703
Oh, get the fuck away from me,

29:51.790 --> 29:53.872
you little motherfucker!
Oh, I'll fucking kill you!

29:53.959 --> 29:56.079
I'll shove this mop up
your fucking ass, motherfucker!

29:57.087 --> 29:59.078
Get the fuck away from me!

30:31.163 --> 30:32.448
Coffee.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.380
Coffee.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.008
Coffee.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.421
Centerville police department.
This is chief robertson.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.215
Hi, Hank. What's up?

32:10.595 --> 32:12.085
Is it really 6:30?

32:17.811 --> 32:18.891
What?

32:21.273 --> 32:22.604
At the diner?

32:42.127 --> 32:44.584
Uh, like I said on the phone, cliff,

32:45.672 --> 32:48.004
often, fern gets here early,

32:48.091 --> 32:50.878
and so I thought I might
get some coffee to go.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.459
And... and then this.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.635
Oh, my god. I saw them.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.590
Fern and Lily.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.225
Oh, man.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.467
Uh, what the hell was it?

33:38.099 --> 33:40.761
A wild animal?
Uh, several wild animals?

33:41.561 --> 33:42.801
I don't know.

33:44.105 --> 33:48.269
But whatever it was,
it even smashed the coffeepots.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.719
Oh, yuck.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.616
Jesus Christ, cliff.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.699
What the heck was it,
a wild animal?

34:45.958 --> 34:47.415
Several wild animals?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.163
That's exactly what I said.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.561
Hey, guys.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.230
Wow. Fern's really done wonders
with these flower beds.

35:14.738 --> 35:16.353
Really perks up the place, huh?

35:21.036 --> 35:22.071
What?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.202
- What happened?
- God, mindy.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.706
I don't think you want to see this.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.438
Uh, no, no, I didn't need to see that.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.397
Was it a wild animal?

36:01.201 --> 36:03.112
Or several wild animals?

36:05.955 --> 36:08.241
Cliff, is that really
fern and Lily in there?

36:08.917 --> 36:10.157
Uh, no.

36:11.336 --> 36:15.079
That was fern and Lily, but now...

36:22.597 --> 36:23.882
Do you need me here?

36:24.724 --> 36:26.885
Maybe you could help out
with crowd control.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.679
Okay, folks, can you move it
along now, please?

36:32.774 --> 36:34.310
Thank you.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.562
I can't believe it.

36:49.374 --> 36:52.332
God, Ronnie. This is really awful.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.909
Maybe the worst thing
I've ever seen.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.790
Yeah. Sure is.

37:02.178 --> 37:03.839
I... I got to go.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.396
So, what are you thinking?

37:26.327 --> 37:29.615
You... you really want to know?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.581
I'm thinking zombies.

37:34.169 --> 37:35.500
What?

37:35.587 --> 37:36.918
You know, zombies.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.292
Ghouls. The undead.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.546
Are you...

37:45.513 --> 37:47.253
You're trying to tell me...

37:50.018 --> 37:51.883
You're thinking zombies did this?

37:53.897 --> 37:54.977
Yep.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.501
Hey, Jack, will you check your phone
and see where we are exactly?

38:21.591 --> 38:22.706
Yeah.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.923
Oh, man. I'm not getting
any reception out here.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.686
Jeez, I don't even know
if my phone's working, for some reason.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.897
Let me try the radio.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.903
Oh, wow, it's working again, so...

38:48.993 --> 38:50.673
They're absolutely wrong.

38:50.703 --> 38:54.070
We know very well that polar fracking
has been great for this country.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.248
In my opinion, these naysayers
should just move to somewhere else

38:57.335 --> 38:59.667
- where they don't have to...
- I'm not listening to this.

39:03.216 --> 39:06.333
J and the streets look so empty j

39:06.427 --> 39:09.009
j in the morning j

39:09.097 --> 39:11.884
"the dead don't die."
I love this song.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.261
J there'll be no one out at night &

39:15.353 --> 39:17.810
j for the lights to shine down on j

39:19.274 --> 39:23.187
j but the dead will still be
walking round &

39:23.278 --> 39:26.486
j in this old world alone j

39:27.156 --> 39:30.523
j well, after life is over &

39:31.619 --> 39:34.361
j the afterlife goes on &

39:35.665 --> 39:37.405
j hearts break &

39:37.500 --> 39:40.367
j when loved ones journey on j

39:41.462 --> 39:43.453
j at the thought &

39:43.548 --> 39:46.540
j that they're now forever gone j

39:47.218 --> 39:49.630
j so we tell ourselves &

39:49.721 --> 39:53.839
j they're all still

39:53.933 --> 39:55.264

39:55.351 --> 39:58.593
J gone but not forgotten j

39:59.397 --> 40:02.309
j just memories left behind &

40:10.742 --> 40:13.575
Oh, shit, you guys.
We have to stop and get gas.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.414
Look. Gas sign right there.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.288
J but the dead will still be
walking round &

40:23.880 --> 40:26.792
j in this old world alone... j

40:27.967 --> 40:30.128
okay, cool.
Come back soon, okay?

40:30.219 --> 40:31.504
See you, Bobby.

40:31.596 --> 40:34.554
- Stay sick, guys.
- Turn blue, Bobby.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.053
Hey, kids, how's it going?

40:38.144 --> 40:39.475
Eat me.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.450
Whoa, this place is a trip.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.198
Sure is.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.114
Oh. Hi.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.415
Hi.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.371
Nice shirt.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.373
Nosferatu. Yeah.

41:07.006 --> 41:08.291
It's really cool.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.504
Thanks. I make 'em.

41:12.595 --> 41:15.257
How about that?
Earth off its axis.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.384
- End of the world.
- Mm.

41:20.186 --> 41:21.847
Flesh-eating zombies.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.099
You get a lot of zombies
around here?

41:24.190 --> 41:26.852
That depends, I guess.

41:28.277 --> 41:33.317
Uh, so... so, about the gas.
You want to pay cash or credit?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.196
Here you go, Frodo.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.486
Cool. Thanks.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.865
Uh, did you, uh...

41:45.086 --> 41:47.202
Did you just call me Frodo?

41:47.296 --> 41:48.456
Did I?

41:48.548 --> 41:50.584
Hey, is there a motel in town?

41:50.675 --> 41:53.462
- Yeah, there is one just down the...
- Ooh.

41:53.553 --> 41:57.887
Oh, that's a really good cd.
Sturgill Simpson, "the dead don't die."

41:57.974 --> 41:59.839
Yeah, I know. I love this song.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.299
Is it nice?

42:02.186 --> 42:04.177
- What?
- The motel.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.562
Oh, yeah.
It's, uh... it's kind of cool.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.264
It's one of those old-school ones.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.934
Like in old-school horror movies,
with, like...

42:11.029 --> 42:13.236
Like in psycho
with the separated bungalows?

42:14.657 --> 42:16.898
Uh, the bates motel in psycho

42:16.993 --> 42:20.281
was not separated into
"little bungalows."

42:22.165 --> 42:23.746
- Ooh.
- All right.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.415
That's 12 for the cd
and two dollars for the soda.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.666
Here you go.
You can just keep the change.

42:31.758 --> 42:32.838
Oh, cool.

42:33.426 --> 42:35.132
Whoa.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.092
That's a super cool ride,
by the way.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.724
Very, uh, George romero.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.270
Yeah, it's a classic.

42:49.108 --> 42:52.726
Your film knowledge is impressive.
What's your name?

42:52.820 --> 42:56.153
Bobby. Bobby wiggins.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.819
What's that? Bobby Baggins?

42:59.452 --> 43:00.817
No, wiggins.

43:01.537 --> 43:03.277
I'm Zoe.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.703
Thanks, Bobby.

43:57.844 --> 43:59.550
Will the feds be brought in on this?

43:59.637 --> 44:02.094
It's... it's really weird.

44:05.560 --> 44:06.595
I see.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.306
But miss o'brien...

44:09.772 --> 44:11.728
So she has to stay with us
another night?

44:14.402 --> 44:16.688
Oh, god.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.145
Okay. Thank you.

44:21.993 --> 44:23.108
Hello, Ms. Winston.

44:23.202 --> 44:27.161
Hello, officer Minerva Morrison.
Do call me Zelda.

44:27.248 --> 44:28.829
Yeah, okay, sure.

44:30.084 --> 44:31.699
You've been informed
of the tragedy?

44:31.794 --> 44:35.286
I have. Am I to understand
that the remains will be brought

44:35.381 --> 44:38.748
to the ever after funeral home
for my preparations?

44:38.843 --> 44:40.674
Uh, no, that won't be necessary.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.481
The feds have already
collected the remains.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.991
They've brought them
out of the county.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.130
I see.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.315
Is there anything else I can do?

44:56.402 --> 44:59.610
Yes. I do have
an unrelated question.

44:59.697 --> 45:02.439
Shoot. "Shoot"?

45:02.533 --> 45:04.273
I mean ask me.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.574
Oh, yes.

45:06.537 --> 45:10.405
Are you, by any chance, a couple?
You and the physically attractive one?

45:11.292 --> 45:13.749
Um, you mean the younger one?

45:13.836 --> 45:15.042
Officer Peterson?

45:15.129 --> 45:17.745
That's the one I mean.
Officer Ronald Peterson.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.007
Well, actually, no.

45:23.846 --> 45:25.177
Why do you ask, Zelda?

45:25.973 --> 45:28.089
Just accumulating local information.

45:29.602 --> 45:32.469
Oh. Okay.

45:41.948 --> 45:45.190
Dear Jesus. I mean,
that's absolutely horrible.

45:45.826 --> 45:49.785
I mean, who or what is
perpetrating these... these...

45:49.872 --> 45:51.157
Hey.

45:51.249 --> 45:52.785
- What's going on?
- Hey.

45:54.377 --> 45:58.120
Nice car. '08 Pontiac lemans.

45:58.214 --> 46:00.000
Yeah. It's a beauty, huh?

46:00.091 --> 46:02.207
It's our friend's
totally rad ride.

46:02.301 --> 46:03.461
It's a classic.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.006
Have a good one.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.714
- Later.
- Guys, I'm so hungry.

46:09.809 --> 46:10.969
Same. Let's eat.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.600
I'll ask. Hey.

46:14.897 --> 46:16.888
- Nice car.
- Thank you.

46:16.983 --> 46:19.645
Uh, do you guys know if there's
a diner or restaurant nearby?

46:19.735 --> 46:20.850
Sorry.

46:20.945 --> 46:25.109
The only diner in town
is closed, indefinitely.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.530
Well, that's unfortunate.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.734
Uh, but we, uh, have
several vending machines

46:29.829 --> 46:32.491
containing snacks, uh,
right over by the office.

46:32.581 --> 46:35.118
Okay. Thanks. Do you have change
for three dollars?

46:35.209 --> 46:36.540
Yeah, I do.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.552
I like your badge.

46:50.266 --> 46:52.848
Oh, th-thank you.

46:54.186 --> 46:55.471
That's, uh...

46:58.733 --> 47:00.769
- That... that should be good.
- Oh, okay.

47:00.860 --> 47:01.975
- Thanks.
- Oh, no, no.

47:02.069 --> 47:03.525
You can, you can have it. Yeah?

47:03.612 --> 47:04.818
Okay. Thanks.

47:07.325 --> 47:11.113
They just checked in.
Hipsters from the big city.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.869
- Yeah?
- Yep.

47:14.623 --> 47:17.205
My educated guess
would be Pittsburgh.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.158
They got that urban style,
you know.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.998
Oh, well, those plates
are from Ohio,

47:22.089 --> 47:24.796
so my educated guess
would be Cleveland.

47:24.884 --> 47:28.593
Oh. Cleveland. Hmm.

47:30.431 --> 47:32.342
Yeah, Cleveland.

47:33.559 --> 47:34.674
Thanks.

47:34.769 --> 47:36.259
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.542
That girl's part Mexican.

47:40.566 --> 47:43.729
- Hmm?
- Really? How can you tell?

47:43.819 --> 47:47.277
I have an affinity for Mexicans.
They're, like, my favorite people.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.856
I love Mexico.
I've been down there twice.

47:51.577 --> 47:54.694
Okay, Ronnie, then you
should be the one to inform them

47:54.789 --> 47:56.996
that if they're gonna spend
the night in Centerville,

47:57.458 --> 48:01.667
to not go out and to keep
their hotel room door locked.

48:01.754 --> 48:02.754
Okay?

48:09.387 --> 48:12.094
Uh, you know, cliff, uh...

48:13.724 --> 48:16.557
I know this isn't important
comparatively, uh...

48:16.644 --> 48:19.135
But, uh, all of my cats are gone.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.267
And, normally, they...
They, uh, just stay inside.

48:24.693 --> 48:27.901
Well, I'm sorry about that, Danny.
They could be hiding.

48:30.032 --> 48:32.193
Nothing is happening normally
right now.

48:32.827 --> 48:35.318
- Yeah.
- How did they react?

48:35.913 --> 48:38.655
They said, "I heard you had
a lot of zombies around here,"

48:38.749 --> 48:41.286
and then they laughed.

48:41.377 --> 48:45.461
Infernal hipsters
with their irony.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.205
Melville.

49:29.341 --> 49:32.549
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals."

49:43.147 --> 49:47.390
Well, everything
looks normal out there.

49:47.485 --> 49:48.600
Yeah.

49:49.111 --> 49:52.023
But what happened
sounds like the start

49:52.114 --> 49:53.945
of a gruesome horror film.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.148
- Sure does.
- Boo!

49:57.411 --> 50:00.118
Really, really not funny,
Geronimo.

50:00.706 --> 50:03.539
You guys hear about those
grisly murders at the diner?

50:03.626 --> 50:06.163
Yeah. Just talking about them.

50:06.253 --> 50:09.791
Creepy. I've been
listening to the radio,

50:09.882 --> 50:11.588
and I'm sure it's the undead, yo.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.750
Reanimated by the earth
being thrown off its axis

50:14.845 --> 50:16.301
from the polar fracking.

50:16.805 --> 50:18.090
What are you saying?

50:20.476 --> 50:23.263
Full-on zombie apocalypse, baby.

50:24.146 --> 50:25.761
Soon, there'll be hordes of them.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.097
- Geronimo.
- Shit.

50:28.192 --> 50:29.978
Do you want to lose
your privileges again?

50:30.069 --> 50:31.855
No, sir.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.311
Then let's go.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.197
Unbelievable.

51:02.768 --> 51:04.448
Cliff,
why'd they used to separate

51:04.478 --> 51:06.389
the children's graves from the adults'?

51:07.273 --> 51:10.106
Don't know. Some kind of
a 19th-century thing.

51:10.192 --> 51:11.307
Huh.

51:12.444 --> 51:14.810
Seems like a bad idea somehow.

51:15.364 --> 51:18.731
Yeah. So, what exactly are we
looking for here? Zombies?

51:18.826 --> 51:19.941
Whoal

51:32.298 --> 51:33.754
Hey, look over here.

51:35.593 --> 51:36.833
Here's another one.

51:41.682 --> 51:44.515
Oh, man.
This isn't gonna end well.

52:16.008 --> 52:17.418
Goddamn it.

52:18.260 --> 52:19.591
Ghouls.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.506
This is undead, reanimated,

52:25.601 --> 52:29.719
full-on, flesh-eating zombie shit.
No question.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.665
I was supposed to retire.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.291
- Two years ago.
- I know.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.466
Why didn't you? What?

53:01.553 --> 53:03.043
Retire two years ago.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.508
Are we improvising here?

53:07.101 --> 53:08.557
No, I was just asking.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.639
But I probably know
the answer anyway.

53:11.730 --> 53:14.437
Probably. Yeah.

53:18.362 --> 53:21.024
So, is our plan
to continue to inform people

53:21.115 --> 53:23.652
about the zombie danger
before it gets dark?

53:24.201 --> 53:25.907
Oh, god, Ronnie.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.781
Uh... I guess so.

53:28.872 --> 53:31.488
Because we passed
farmer Miller's place a little while ago.

53:31.583 --> 53:32.948
Do we need to inform him?

53:33.043 --> 53:34.374
Fuck farmer Miller.

53:36.171 --> 53:39.789
Really? He is a citizen of Centerville.

53:42.219 --> 53:44.130
You're right. Uh...

53:46.473 --> 53:48.134
We'll have mindy call him.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.465
Oh, okay.

53:58.986 --> 54:02.570
So, Ronnie, how the fuck
do you kill a zombie?

54:02.656 --> 54:04.317
Well, you got to kill the head.

54:06.076 --> 54:08.158
"Kill the head." Yeah.

54:08.245 --> 54:11.282
By any means necessary,
kill the head.

54:12.666 --> 54:14.531
Decapitate.
It's the only way to kill them.

54:16.795 --> 54:18.285
Jesus.

54:20.132 --> 54:25.968
And that's really the only way
to stop zombies,

54:26.054 --> 54:28.010
is to kill the head, Hank.

54:28.766 --> 54:33.510
I know it's gruesome,
but complete decapitation.

54:34.521 --> 54:38.764
Doesn't matter if you use
a machete, steel wire,

54:38.859 --> 54:40.975
hedge clippers, whatever.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.691
Just as long as the spinal cord
is severed, right?

54:44.782 --> 54:48.070
And the head... is cut off.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.486
And that's it. De-animated.

54:53.457 --> 54:58.292
Only way to kill the dead:
Kill the head.

54:58.378 --> 54:59.868
Uh, wait, Bobby.

55:00.714 --> 55:03.251
I... I'm not so sure it was zombies.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.762
You said they ate
Lily and fern's flesh.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.515
Usually, they go for the brains.

55:15.354 --> 55:16.594
It's unusual, but...

55:18.190 --> 55:20.021
It's still cannibals, man.

55:20.567 --> 55:21.727
Mm.

55:22.236 --> 55:25.569
Definitely zombies. Okay?

55:26.281 --> 55:28.693
Hank, you can trust me.

55:28.784 --> 55:32.527
I've seen almost every
zombie film ever made.

55:32.621 --> 55:33.906
Mm.

55:33.997 --> 55:37.080
This is zombie shit going down,
and we got to get prepared.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.953
I don't know
what to think anymore.

55:40.879 --> 55:42.961
Hank, the shells.

55:43.549 --> 55:44.755
Oh, yeah.

55:49.096 --> 55:50.677
Better safe than sorry.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.721
Yeah, you're right.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.259
Safe than sorry.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.683
Just kill the head.

56:02.276 --> 56:04.688
Several other shocking
and brutal attacks

56:04.778 --> 56:08.566
occurred in this residential neighborhood
just outside east Brady.

56:08.657 --> 56:11.865
The images are just too gruesome
to broadcast at this time,

56:11.952 --> 56:14.614
and police are saying
that it almost looked like

56:14.705 --> 56:17.447
the victims were attacked
by a wild animal

56:17.541 --> 56:20.578
or perhaps several wild animals.

56:23.338 --> 56:26.455
Police did provide this map showing...

56:26.550 --> 56:28.791
Goddamn it,
my watch doesn't fucking work.

56:28.886 --> 56:30.672
I just got it. It's mad expensive.

56:31.430 --> 56:34.593
Holy shit, dude, this is insane.
“Wow.

56:35.684 --> 56:39.051
Maybe that Harry Potter guy at
the gas station wasn't kidding, man.

56:39.146 --> 56:40.727
What, about what?

56:41.523 --> 56:43.918
- About there being zombies around here.
- That's not even funny.

56:43.942 --> 56:46.024
Don't joke.
It's really, really creepy.

56:46.111 --> 56:49.069
Authorities are warning
all citizens to stay inside

56:49.156 --> 56:52.023
and keep all doors and windows
locked and secured.

56:52.117 --> 56:54.153
- Zack, lock the door, will you?
- Got you.

56:54.244 --> 56:57.281
But for now, this is posie juarez
for Centerville 7 news.

56:58.832 --> 57:00.948
Stay safe and keep your eyes open.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.019
Kitties!

58:07.567 --> 58:09.023
Where are you guys?

58:15.283 --> 58:16.898
Kitties!

58:21.373 --> 58:22.863
Kitties!

58:28.463 --> 58:30.954
What in the name of...

58:31.925 --> 58:33.415
Cats are gone.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.252
Haven't seen or heard a bird
in two days.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.146
It's already night out.

58:38.223 --> 58:40.339
It's 5:00.

58:41.601 --> 58:43.057
Dear lord in heaven, help us.

58:43.145 --> 58:45.010
Free cable.

58:45.105 --> 58:47.938
Oh, it's free ca... aah!

58:58.910 --> 59:00.821
Thank god you guys are back.

59:03.498 --> 59:06.285
Jesus, cliff, do we really need
all this stuff?

59:08.920 --> 59:10.501
What's all this for?

59:10.589 --> 59:13.922
We went by the hardware store.
You know what happens.

59:15.218 --> 59:18.301
Hank and that hobbit kid Bobby
from the gas station

59:18.388 --> 59:19.868
have locked themselves in over there.

59:20.974 --> 59:22.974
They tried to convince
other citizens to join them,

59:23.060 --> 59:24.641
but with no success.

59:24.728 --> 59:28.061
Why? What's happening?
Is it some sort of epidemic or what?

59:29.858 --> 59:31.143
It's zombies.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.840
- What are you saying?
- Well, it's the undead.

59:35.864 --> 59:37.775
They've been reanimated.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.608
Caused by the earth
having been pulled off its axis,

59:41.286 --> 59:42.901
caused by the polar fracking.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.611
But the authorities
and energy people

59:44.706 --> 59:46.162
keep saying that's not true.

59:50.378 --> 59:51.493
Really?

59:56.259 --> 59:59.217
Oh, my god.

59:59.304 --> 01:00:00.885
- She's alive?
- No.

01:00:00.972 --> 01:00:03.213
She's not. She's just undead.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:06.257
Chardonnay.

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:10.433
Holy shit.
Did she just say "chardonnay"?

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:11.764
Yeah, she did.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.603
Look out, kids.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.643
Hey, little Mallory.

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:24.697
Chardonnay.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.323
I got this, cliff.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:49.972
Chardonnay.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.770
Those are some pretty good cuts.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.661
You played some
minor league ball, didn't you?

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:02.109
Well, um, a little class a.
It was a long time ago.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:06.238
Mindy, just remember
to kill the head.

01:01:07.873 --> 01:01:08.908
Okay.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.081
Kill the head. Okay.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.829
Ronnie, take this thing
out of here.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.334
You got it, chief.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.457
Oh, that's very nice.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:23.425
Very nice, indeed.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.676
You look gorgeous.

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:32.053
You two could have been the king
and queen of the golf club, so you could.

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:37.102
Oh, my.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.066
What's this?

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:56.913
Are you in this together?

01:01:57.756 --> 01:02:00.042
I mean, this is
really inappropriate.

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:02.586
Oh, good grief.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:09.340
So, the dead just don't want
to die today. Is that it?

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.153
That's a shame.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.072
I had them looking so bonny.

01:02:28.203 --> 01:02:30.489
Oh, what is it now?

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.083
Who's there?

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.508
Shit.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.183
Who the fuck are you,
and what do you want?

01:03:02.279 --> 01:03:04.486
Ow! Hey!

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.233
Get the fuck...

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.826
Shit.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:22.669
I killed him.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.547
That was weird.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.044
Candy.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:30.258
- Candy.
- Snapple.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:32.384
Snapple.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.014
Snickers.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.896
- Popsicle.
- Snickers.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.856
Popsicle.

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.575
Popsicle.

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:05.709
Toys.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:09.463
Skittles.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.134
Toys.

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:25.858
Wi-Fi.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.604
Wi-Fi.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:31.405
Bluetooth.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:35.819
Bluetooth.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:40.080
Siri.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:43.744
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.005
- Xanax.
- Oxy.

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.587
- Ambien.
- Oxy.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.931
Guitar.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.852
Guitar.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.855
Tools. Drill.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.233
Sander.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.060
Tools.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:12.776
- Hey, no. Come on.
- Hey. Hey.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:14.698
Okay, okay. Holy shit.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.777
- Hey, we need to mow them down.
- Come on, man.

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.231
Bobby. Shit.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.539
I got this one, Hank.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:36.265
Shit.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:44.562
Hey, Bobby!

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.934
The head, Hank!

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.647
I killed the head.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:07.369
What the fuck? Is this for real?

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:10.046
- Shh, shh! Shh, shh, shh.
- Quiet!

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.212
Get the fuck off me!

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.046
- Fuck!
- Holy shit!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.055
Shithead!

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.101
Save me!

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.726
- What? No!
- What are you doing? Stop!

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:28.776
Get the fuck off me!

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:30.402
Closet.

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:37.857
- Fuck!
- Fucking shithead!

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:46.912
Violent...

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.995
Reports of these
bizarre attacks are escalating,

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:52.831
with incidents occurring sporadically
across the country

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:56.544
and, as we're now learning,
uh, across the globe.

01:06:56.638 --> 01:06:58.424
You see, these violent marauders

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:01.723
have apparently first
been gathering in cemeteries,

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:05.552
then dispersing
into towns and suburbs,

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.433
while other reports suggest...

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.818
Great.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.028
Now even the radio's dead.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.488
Good riddance.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.621
Guys...

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.913
Shouldn't we be telling each other
that it's all gonna be okay?

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:34.707
That this will all go away,
like a bad dream?

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:39.263
Ronnie?

01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:44.299
Gee, mindy,
I'm not sure I can say that.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:50.889
Cliff?

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:53.565
Please?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.023
It's all gonna be okay, mindy.

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:02.363
Maybe it'll all just go away,
like a bad dream.

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:07.872
I doubt it.

01:08:45.078 --> 01:08:46.615
Cleveland.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.920
What the...

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:09.301
Now, that's what I call
a murder of crows.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:34.658
Darn, she's really good
with that thing, isn't she?

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:36.118
She sure is.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:43.129
She's strange.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:46.888
- She's Scottish.
- She's Scottish?

01:10:01.906 --> 01:10:04.067
Let's unbolt the door
and get her in here.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.372
Thank you very much,
officer Ronald Peterson.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:17.168
Chief Clifford robertson.
Officer Minerva Morrison.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.956
What exactly is your plan of action,
chief Clifford robertson?

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.542
Well... well...

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.549
Uh, it's a little quieter now.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.882
I... I think... I guess we should
just get in the patrol car...

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:34.640
Some of us, anyway...
And, uh, patrol the community.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.347
- After all, that is our job.
- I'm not staying here.

01:10:37.442 --> 01:10:39.182
I think we should all go together.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.185
Well, I guess you're right.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:48.237
I could stay here and monitor things,
if that would help.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:52.741
I'm quite confident of my ability
to defend myself against the undead.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.368
Well, I... I can see that.

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:02.664
But, uh, can you operate
the police radio and our computer?

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:08.879
Oh, aye. No bother.

01:11:09.307 --> 01:11:10.467
Certainly.

01:11:10.558 --> 01:11:13.800
- Yeah, if it still works.
- I don't know.

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:18.062
That would be a little unusual,
wouldn't it, cliff?

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.919
Well, this is a highly
unusual situation we're in,

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:23.275
is it not, chief Clifford robertson?

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:28.902
Perhaps we could all meet up again
in a wee while in the cemetery.

01:11:34.207 --> 01:11:36.698
Yeah, it's okay.
I guess it's okay.

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.910
Uh, let's go, guys. We've got
some more weapons in the patrol car.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:42.211
Excuse me, officer Ronald Peterson.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:45.506
Might I request that I have the use
of your own personal vehicle?

01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:51.091
Oh. Oh, uh... okay.

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.602
Oh. Star wars.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.270
Excellent fiction.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:03.225
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah.
- Mm.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.026
- It's the, uh...
- Red convertible smart car?

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:07.148
Yes.

01:12:16.207 --> 01:12:17.617
Mind how you go.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.570
Slow down a second, cliff.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.701
Excuse me.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.834
Yes.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:07.956
Kill the head.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:28.017
They gravitate towards things
they did when they were alive.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.065
Yeah.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.822
Tennis girl's kind of cute.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.738
Geez, cliff.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:39.987
This is way too creepy.

01:13:54.764 --> 01:13:56.004
Oh, god.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.051
I know those kids.

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:00.800
But they're all dead.

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:11.603
Watch it, cliff.

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.357
Did you have to do that?

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.113
I'm sorry. I didn't see him.

01:14:18.204 --> 01:14:21.742
Well, it doesn't matter, mindy.
They're already dead.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.909
Well, undead, to be precise.
Reanimated.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.381
Fucking trespasser.

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.083
Kiss your ass goodbye.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:43.976
Oh, shit, where are they all
coming from?

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.666
It seems pretty quiet.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.965
But door number three is open,
so I'm gonna check it out.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:16.588
Let's both check it out.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.715
Well, I'm coming, too.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:39.865
Oh, that's bad.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:51.095
Sturgill Simpson.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.500
Oh, my god.

01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:20.670
Why did you do that?

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:25.136
They're not zombies.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.470
They're just dead people.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:32.053
Well, yeah, for now,
they're still just dead hipsters,

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:33.854
but they haven't turned yet.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:35.181
It can take a while.

01:17:35.776 --> 01:17:37.016
He's right, mindy.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.020
Now they're just...

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:44.857
Dead hipsters from Cleveland.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:49.987
Oh, my god. I can't.

01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:53.832
My god.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:28.492
Well, look at all of you.

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.370
So very ravenous,

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.741
yet well past your expiration date.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.926
Oh, man.
Get a load of these two.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:56.224
Coffee.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:19:01.021
- Coffee.
- Coffee.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:27.384
Oh, god. Not that again.

01:19:29.139 --> 01:19:30.379
Sturgill Simpson.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.761
- & oh, the dead don't die &
- Great song.

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:37.804
J any more than you or I §

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.849
j they're just ghosts
inside a dream j

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.937
j of a life that we don't own &

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:50.195
j they walk around us
all the time... &

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:53.451
goddamn it.
I can't take any more.

01:20:00.546 --> 01:20:02.286
That was irrational, cliff.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:38.030
Fuck. Do you think Hank
and Bobby wiggins are still in there?

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:43.869
Should we try to get 'em out?

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:47.335
Uh, cliff, we're drawing
some attention.

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.588
Oh, god, cliff.

01:20:50.346 --> 01:20:52.211
Please get us out of here.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:55.844
Please, cliff. Please.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.472
That should hold.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.523
Goddamn zombies, Bobby.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:25.369
I know those guys.
They were two of my best customers.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:29.002
Yeah, yeah, the good brothers.
Travis and Dallas good.

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.879
They died in a car crash
some time back.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.010
Oh, shit.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.346
Yeah, now I remember those guys.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:41.268
The good brothers.
They were really good guitar pickers.

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:44.638
That's right. It's like
they came out of the birth canal

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.769
with guitars in their hands.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:52.029
I think you saved my life, man.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:54.815
No worries, Hank.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:02.577
Shit.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.205
- What?
- The fucking back door.

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:07.912
The back door
to the storage room.

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.792
- What?
- Here.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:15.503
Jesus, Bobby.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:17.713
Shit.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.056
There's way too many, Hank.

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:27.140
This here is a nightmare, Bobby.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:28.878
We're goners, man.

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.018
Fuck.

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:14.770
Come on. Give me that!

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:16.505
Well, I'll be a monkey's ass.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.442
It's finally payback time.

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:22.903
You goddamn refugees!
I'll get all of you!

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:24.784
You're gonna pay for this!

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.168
Get off my property!

01:23:30.255 --> 01:23:31.620
- Hey! Ow!
- Mmm.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:35.215
This is good chicken.

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:40.132
Damn it! Hey!

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.842
Stay back!

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:04.611
You want to get out and check?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:10.250
Uh, I'd... I'd rather not.

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.330
Well, that's perfect, isn't it?

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.174
Right in the middle
of the fucking cemetery.

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:20.344
No, it isn't perfect.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.847
Why did you run over them?

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.564
They are not
ordinary pedestrians.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:48.413
This is definitely
gonna end badly.

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.626
Shut up, Ronnie.

01:24:56.174 --> 01:24:57.414
No, you shut up.

01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:01.092
Shut up, Ronnie!

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:04.137
Please stop fighting.

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.930
Please.

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:08.717
Mindy.

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:11.557
Mindy.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:18.401
It's my grandmother.

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:22.689
Oh, god, granny.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:24.695
- Mindy, mindy.
- No.

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:28.825
Mindy, get it together.
It was your grandmother.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:36.128
I can't take this anymore.

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:40.423
I can't do it!
I'm done with this nightmare.

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.135
Granny, I'm coming.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:46.679
- I'm coming.
- Mindy?

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.098
No, mindy! No, don't!

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:01.986
Holy fuck.

01:26:02.783 --> 01:26:04.148
God help us.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.355
Centerville.

01:26:42.114 --> 01:26:43.320
Usa.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.447
A real nice place.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:05.216
What an amusing little machine.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.971
Oh, here's a curious one.

01:27:22.696 --> 01:27:23.811
Hello there.

01:27:25.574 --> 01:27:26.780
Fashion.

01:27:29.619 --> 01:27:31.985
I can assure you
that is not your tartan.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:36.119
Nice neck, though.

01:28:00.317 --> 01:28:02.558
Come on. I know
a safe place we can hide.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.366
Oh, shit.

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.619
Is that Danny Perkins?
Over here.

01:28:21.463 --> 01:28:23.454
Sure looks like him.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.046
I'm sorry, Ronnie, if I've lost it.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:35.849
It's okay, cliff.

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.476
But I got to say,

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.147
you have been acting a lot different

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:45.772
since all this weird shit
started happening.

01:28:46.279 --> 01:28:48.270
What... what are you saying, cliff?

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:55.402
I mean, shit.

01:28:56.832 --> 01:29:01.246
Well, I'm just, you know,
dealing with it in my own way.

01:29:03.588 --> 01:29:06.000
But I've been telling you
this is all gonna end badly.

01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:09.128
Goddamn it, Ronnie.

01:29:22.065 --> 01:29:24.021
May I ask you a question?

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:25.519
Sure. Ask away.

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:31.609
You have been saying that
this is all gonna end badly,

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:34.442
from the very beginning,
over and over.

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:40.872
So, what made you
so fucking sure of that?

01:29:42.586 --> 01:29:44.952
How did you know everything
in advance?

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:48.830
Do you really want to know? Yes!

01:29:49.509 --> 01:29:51.500
I want to know.
I really want to know!

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:55.179
Okay. I know because
I've read the script.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.434
You...

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.433
Read the script.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.145
The whole script?

01:30:11.114 --> 01:30:12.320
All of it?

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:15.115
Yeah. Jim gave me the whole script.

01:30:17.412 --> 01:30:20.575
He only gave me our scenes.

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:25.454
I never saw a complete script.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:30.251
After all... I've done for that guy.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.754
And it's a lot that
you don't even know about.

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:38.217
What a dick.

01:31:16.763 --> 01:31:18.048
That's weird.

01:31:19.516 --> 01:31:20.881
They're all leaving.

01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.664
Right. Here we go.

01:32:16.865 --> 01:32:20.107
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:23.026
I think I am.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:30.708
Was that in the script?

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:32.911
No.

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:35.755
Not the one I read.

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:23.212
Well, that was unexpected.

01:33:24.516 --> 01:33:27.428
I knew there was something
unusual about her.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.476
Yeah.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:37.267
So, Ronnie, how does it end, then?

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:40.649
Well...

01:33:44.702 --> 01:33:46.567
We got to give it our best shot.

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:50.822
"Our best shot.” okay. Yeah.

01:33:52.585 --> 01:33:55.452
But then it ends badly, right?

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.289
Uh, yeah. Yeah, it does.

01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:01.340
Okay, then.

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:03.801
Let's do it.

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:07.347
Let's do it.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:39.545
Cliff and little Ronnie.

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:42.340
Warriors.

01:34:43.803 --> 01:34:45.293
Among the dead.

01:34:55.148 --> 01:34:56.148
Zombies.

01:34:58.610 --> 01:35:00.726
Remnants of the materialist people.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:09.276
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't.

01:35:12.999 --> 01:35:15.741
I guess
they've been zombies all along.

01:35:17.337 --> 01:35:18.497
Ghosts.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:20.420
Oh, hey, Bobby.

01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:24.092
Shit.

01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:37.516
"Nameless miseries
of the numberless mortals.”

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:43.605
Frank.

01:35:43.696 --> 01:35:45.277
Hey.

01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:46.605
You got this coming.

01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:53.111
Goodbye, frank.
You reap what you sow.

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:54.946
All right, who's next?

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:57.417
Ow.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.624
Yuck.

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:07.219
All righty.

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:13.764
Hold your head up.

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.856
Granny.

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:24.893
Mindy would want you
to say hi to grandpa.

01:36:28.741 --> 01:36:30.527
Ah, Hank.

01:36:32.412 --> 01:36:33.948
I'm so sorry, brother.

01:36:35.164 --> 01:36:36.574
I just can't do it.

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:39.290
You take care of yourself.

01:36:44.424 --> 01:36:47.291
Danny.

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.921
I just saw Hank.

01:36:51.556 --> 01:36:53.512
Ashes to ashes.

01:36:53.599 --> 01:36:56.215
Dust to dust.

01:36:56.311 --> 01:36:58.643
- Ronnie.
- Mindy!

01:36:59.314 --> 01:37:00.394
Cliff.

01:37:03.443 --> 01:37:05.604
- Ronnie.
- No!

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:13.741
Jesus, Ronnie.

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:32.130
The dead
just don't want to die today.

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:37.640
Reanimated and all jacked up,
just like those ants.

01:37:39.437 --> 01:37:41.223
The end of the world.

01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:59.746
I guess all them ghost people
plumb lost their goddamn souls.

01:38:01.709 --> 01:38:03.700
Must have traded 'em away

01:38:03.795 --> 01:38:06.832
or sold 'em for gold or whatnot.

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:12.175
New trucks, kitchen appliances,

01:38:12.261 --> 01:38:16.345
new trousers,
Nintendo game boys,

01:38:16.432 --> 01:38:18.172
shit like that.

01:38:23.481 --> 01:38:25.938
Just hungry for more stuff.

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:38.159
Oh, down they go.

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.908
The sad end of cliff and Ronnie.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.456
What a fucked-up world.

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:24.163
J oh, the dead don't die &

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:28.122
j any more than you or I §

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:32.080
j they're just ghosts inside a dream

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:36.258
j of a life that we don't own &

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:40.255
j they walk around us all the time j

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:44.555
j never paying any mind &

j to the silly lives we lead j

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:52.608
j or the reaping we've all sown j

01:39:53.613 --> 01:39:56.446
j there's a cup of coffee waiting j

01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:59.239
j on every corner j

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:04.696
js someday we're gonna wake up j

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:08.658
j and find the corners gone j

01:40:09.587 --> 01:40:13.626

J there'll be old friends

j in a somewhat familiar town j

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.034
j that you saw once j

01:40:44.121 --> 01:40:47.158
j when you looked up
from the phone j

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:53.335
j nobody bothers saying hi &

j that we're all not at home &

01:41:06.477 --> 01:41:09.719

j in the morning j

01:41:14.277 --> 01:41:17.440
