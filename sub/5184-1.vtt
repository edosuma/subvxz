00:29.440 --> 00:32.780
<i>The wilds of Sri Lanka,</i>

00:32.820 --> 00:34.610
<i>land of myth and legend.</i>

00:42.370 --> 00:46.960
<i>Where rocky pinnacles
overlook vast tropical forests.</i>

00:50.630 --> 00:54.630
<i>And an abandoned city
lies shrouded in jungle.</i>

00:56.640 --> 01:00.180
<i>The kings who once reigned here
are long gone.</i>

01:00.640 --> 01:04.890
<i>These days,
there's a new dynasty in residence.</i>

01:04.980 --> 01:09.400
<i>But this one is governed
by the law of the jungle.</i>

02:29.400 --> 02:31.190
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

02:31.230 --> 02:35.190
<i>"Being a macaque monkey
is just fun and games."</i>

02:35.230 --> 02:39.660
<i>But, actually, it's an intricate society
of 50 members</i>

02:39.740 --> 02:42.280
<i>bound together by a strict social order.</i>

02:44.040 --> 02:48.250
<i>In this troop, every waking moment
is a reminder of your place.</i>

02:49.960 --> 02:52.670
<i>From a seemingly innocent greeting.</i>

02:54.130 --> 02:56.090
<i>Oh! He'll learn.</i>

02:57.130 --> 02:59.260
<i>To your choice of sleeping branch.</i>

02:59.300 --> 03:02.720
<i>Upper class,
basking in the morning sun.</i>

03:02.760 --> 03:06.270
<i>Lower class, shivering in the cold.</i>

03:08.810 --> 03:12.020
<i>Your social rank even determines
what you can eat.</i>

03:14.860 --> 03:17.530
<i>Nowhere is that clearer than here.</i>

03:17.610 --> 03:21.110
<i>The kingdom's most prized fig tree.</i>

03:32.210 --> 03:34.960
<i>Only those at the top
of the social ladder</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:36.920
<i>can eat at the top of the tree</i>

03:36.960 --> 03:38.300
<i>where the ripest fruit is found.</i>

03:40.130 --> 03:44.800
<i>And at the very top,
the alpha male himself,</i>

03:44.970 --> 03:46.640
<i>Raja.</i>

03:51.850 --> 03:55.480
<i>He is the king of Monkey Kingdom.</i>

03:57.530 --> 04:01.490
<i>See that move?
That's macaque for "Back off."</i>

04:05.370 --> 04:09.500
<i>Raja arrived from the outside
and fought his way to the top.</i>

04:09.660 --> 04:10.660
<i>So, you know,</i>

04:10.830 --> 04:12.920
<i>he's earned the pampering.</i>

04:13.000 --> 04:15.500
<i>But, if he wants to stay on top,</i>

04:15.590 --> 04:18.089
<i>he's gotta keep
the real power brokers happy.</i>

04:19.380 --> 04:22.340
<i>The three females
on the other high branches.</i>

04:23.840 --> 04:26.430
<i>The queens behind the king.</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.060
<i>The Sisterhood.</i>

04:30.270 --> 04:33.350
<i>Whether you remember them
by their red faces</i>

04:33.390 --> 04:36.110
<i>or their ruthless natures,</i>

04:36.190 --> 04:39.690
<i>you will remember them.</i>

04:41.690 --> 04:45.530
<i>These ladies get what they want.</i>

04:45.700 --> 04:49.160
<i>Their children get what they want.</i>

04:49.200 --> 04:53.870
<i>Everything that is good in the forest
is reserved for them.</i>

04:55.540 --> 04:57.540
<i>Like royalty,</i>

04:57.590 --> 05:01.590
<i>they were born into privilege,
and that's the way it's gonna stay.</i>

05:07.890 --> 05:10.390
<i>Do not get on their bad side.</i>

05:16.650 --> 05:20.400
<i>Descending the tree,
we descend the social ladder.</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:26.160
<i>With each branch, the fruit is less ripe,
and the monkey lower in rank.</i>

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
<i>Until,</i>

05:29.080 --> 05:32.450
<i>at the bottom, the heroine of this story,</i>

05:32.620 --> 05:34.410
<i>Maya.</i>

05:36.750 --> 05:42.000
<i>Maya's got big, friendly eyes,
three distinctive spots on her nose,</i>

05:42.170 --> 05:46.180
<i>and, I think you'll agree,
a pretty rad hairdo.</i>

05:47.760 --> 05:51.680
<i>She was born eight years ago,
at the bottom of the troop,</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:53.850
<i>just like her mother.</i>

05:53.930 --> 05:56.480
<i>And her mother before that.</i>

05:59.520 --> 06:03.320
<i>When you're at the bottom,
you're either in the way,</i>

06:03.690 --> 06:05.950
<i>or you don't even exist.</i>

06:09.120 --> 06:10.950
<i>But every day,</i>

06:11.120 --> 06:13.950
<i>you're paying your dues
to monkeys like Raja</i>

06:14.040 --> 06:16.620
<i>without any chance of promotion.</i>

06:23.840 --> 06:27.630
<i>And so, back under the fig tree,</i>

06:27.800 --> 06:31.140
<i>Maya takes whatever scraps
fall her way.</i>

06:34.310 --> 06:39.480
<i>A low-born like herself
simply can't improve her position</i>

06:39.520 --> 06:42.770
<i>or dream of eating
from a higher branch.</i>

06:42.820 --> 06:43.980
<i>Yet this is the story</i>

06:44.110 --> 06:49.160
<i>of how Maya fights to beat the odds
and make a better life.</i>

06:54.990 --> 06:59.080
<i>For Maya and the troop,
home is Castle Rock,</i>

06:59.250 --> 07:01.040
<i>a magnificent granite outcrop</i>

07:01.210 --> 07:04.250
<i>at the center of the kingdom.</i>

07:04.340 --> 07:08.510
<i>It's the most sought-after residence
for miles around.</i>

07:10.050 --> 07:12.010
<i>It's a pretty sweet neighborhood.</i>

07:15.180 --> 07:19.850
<i>Sweeping views of their territory
are perfect for spotting rivals.</i>

07:21.730 --> 07:24.320
<i>It's got plenty of rec rooms,</i>

07:24.360 --> 07:27.360
<i>nature's finest roof, and, of course,</i>

07:27.530 --> 07:29.780
<i>the original jungle gym.</i>

07:36.740 --> 07:42.040
<i>The monkeys think they own this rock
but there are some tenants.</i>

07:44.420 --> 07:46.420
<i>There's a mongoose in the building.</i>

07:49.050 --> 07:51.970
<i>Day after day they ask him to play.</i>

07:52.470 --> 07:54.890
<i>And his answer is always,</i>

07:55.470 --> 07:57.390
<i>"No, thank you."</i>

08:06.070 --> 08:10.440
<i>But rejection only increases
their determination.</i>

08:10.570 --> 08:13.410
<i>They will play with this mongoose</i>

08:13.450 --> 08:15.450
<i>if it is the last thing they do.</i>

08:25.790 --> 08:27.250
<i>Nothing will stop them.</i>

08:32.340 --> 08:34.929
<i>Even his absence.</i>

08:38.390 --> 08:40.350
<i>Continuing their search...</i>

08:41.309 --> 08:42.850
<i>"Sloth bear!</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.520
<i>"It's cool. I knew he was in there.</i>

08:47.610 --> 08:49.110
<i>"Just a bear."</i>

08:49.610 --> 08:52.780
<i>Mama sloth bear
is keeping her cubs cool,</i>

08:52.860 --> 08:54.740
<i>rehydrating them with</i>

08:54.780 --> 08:56.780
<i>her saliva.</i>

09:00.660 --> 09:03.710
<i>She's also keeping her cubs safe from</i>

09:04.290 --> 09:08.130
<i>this guy, the unwelcome suitor outside.</i>

09:11.630 --> 09:16.640
<i>Mama keeps her cubs well hidden
until he leaves, or...</i>

09:18.180 --> 09:19.680
<i>That'll do.</i>

09:20.470 --> 09:23.390
<i>He's not dead. He's just asleep.</i>

09:37.030 --> 09:38.570
<i>Every morning,</i>

09:38.740 --> 09:42.870
<i>the troop leaves Castle Rock
to scour the forest for breakfast.</i>

09:54.260 --> 09:57.720
<i>Maya can't afford to be a picky eater.</i>

10:00.100 --> 10:02.720
<i>Don't worry. Bambi's not on the menu.</i>

10:03.180 --> 10:07.230
<i>And this squirrel
won't seem to give up his food. Oh.</i>

10:08.270 --> 10:12.440
<i>But, uh, maybe this is promising.</i>

10:20.870 --> 10:21.870
<i>Ugh.</i>

10:25.580 --> 10:28.370
<i>At nearly 40 years old,</i>

10:28.540 --> 10:33.300
<i>Grandpa only moves when
the group tells him it's worthwhile.</i>

10:34.710 --> 10:38.220
<i>That's monkey-speak for "Jackpot!"</i>

10:42.890 --> 10:45.220
<i>But guess who got there first.</i>

10:46.390 --> 10:50.020
<i>Mushrooms are like
potato chips for the sisters.</i>

10:50.060 --> 10:53.400
<i>Once they start, they just can't stop.</i>

10:55.650 --> 10:59.820
<i>Maya waits.
This is what it means to be last in line.</i>

10:59.990 --> 11:03.120
<i>By the time your turn comes,
there's nothing left.</i>

11:19.680 --> 11:23.470
<i>Midday, a scorcher.</i>

11:29.480 --> 11:32.650
<i>Too much lunch.</i>

11:35.520 --> 11:39.280
<i>It's already Grandpa's
fourth nap of the day.</i>

11:43.240 --> 11:46.410
<i>Raja and the sisters
enjoy the sweet dreams</i>

11:46.450 --> 11:48.250
<i>of the high-born.</i>

11:50.710 --> 11:53.670
<i>Maya, on the other hand...</i>

11:54.040 --> 11:57.300
<i>The sisters' kids don't feel like napping.</i>

11:58.840 --> 12:02.300
<i>Maya makes the best play structure.</i>

12:05.550 --> 12:07.260
<i>She'd love to object,</i>

12:07.310 --> 12:09.430
<i>but one swat at the sisters' kids</i>

12:09.480 --> 12:11.940
<i>and there would be big trouble.</i>

12:13.850 --> 12:16.480
<i>Maya just has to take it.</i>

12:16.520 --> 12:19.650
<i>Even if they use her tail
as a rope swing.</i>

12:19.740 --> 12:21.740
<i>That's gotta hurt.</i>

12:41.050 --> 12:43.590
<i>"Guys, don't mess with the hair."</i>

12:49.180 --> 12:53.640
<i>Al' just one month old,
these kids already know Maya's place.</i>

12:54.810 --> 12:57.190
<i>And it's not up there.</i>

13:00.480 --> 13:03.950
<i>So they can poke Maya
in the eye repeatedly.</i>

13:08.910 --> 13:12.500
<i>And forage for food inside her mouth!</i>

13:12.540 --> 13:13.870
<i>That's rude.</i>

13:17.540 --> 13:19.210
<i>Maya will never know the sweet life,</i>

13:19.300 --> 13:22.550
<i>but she does get a break occasionally.</i>

13:30.810 --> 13:33.850
<i>To de-stress, macaques visit</i>

13:33.890 --> 13:38.110
<i>their less sophisticated cousins,
the langurs, treating them like pets.</i>

13:39.860 --> 13:43.900
<i>Seems to lower the blood pressure
and calm the nerves.</i>

13:44.570 --> 13:45.900
<i>The langurs don't mind.</i>

13:45.950 --> 13:49.330
<i>In fact, they may not even notice.</i>

13:52.490 --> 13:54.960
<i>Not the sharpest tools in the shed,</i>

13:55.120 --> 13:56.620
<i>these guys.</i>

14:04.300 --> 14:08.640
<i>And if you want a super fun,
stimulating playmate,</i>

14:08.720 --> 14:11.220
<i>you might have to keep looking.</i>

14:40.330 --> 14:41.840
<i>Now, on the other hand,</i>

14:41.920 --> 14:46.760
<i>a group of intelligent monkeys
is very hard to sneak up on.</i>

14:47.880 --> 14:49.590
<i>Even engrossed in grooming,</i>

14:49.640 --> 14:54.310
<i>Maya has the eyes of her troop
looking out for danger.</i>

15:32.050 --> 15:33.760
<i>The alarm is sounded.</i>

15:51.530 --> 15:53.530
<i>The close escape</i>

15:53.620 --> 15:58.620
<i>is a chilling reminder for Maya
of why she can never leave her group.</i>

16:01.250 --> 16:03.880
<i>Life at the bottom may be hard,</i>

16:03.960 --> 16:05.880
<i>but striking out on her own</i>

16:05.960 --> 16:08.710
<i>would be too dangerous.</i>

16:12.550 --> 16:15.050
<i>While Maya can't leave,</i>

16:15.100 --> 16:17.890
<i>that doesn't mean
something good can't come to her.</i>

16:24.860 --> 16:27.570
<i>His name is Kumar.</i>

16:28.650 --> 16:31.280
<i>15 pounds of hunky monkey.</i>

16:56.390 --> 16:58.260
<i>Like all young males,</i>

16:58.310 --> 17:01.020
<i>this dashing newcomer
left his birth troop</i>

17:01.100 --> 17:02.890
<i>to find a permanent home.</i>

17:05.599 --> 17:06.730
<i>Maya sizes him up.</i>

17:13.650 --> 17:15.819
<i>Kumar is giving Maya the eye.</i>

17:18.579 --> 17:22.910
<i>If Raja catches Kumar flirting,
he'll drive the newcomer away.</i>

17:24.079 --> 17:26.210
<i>Kumar can't get kicked out now.</i>

17:28.250 --> 17:30.050
<i>It's courtship season.</i>

17:56.150 --> 18:00.030
<i>Males throughout the forest
are pulling out their best moves.</i>

18:02.660 --> 18:04.910
<i>Kumar is no exception.</i>

18:11.550 --> 18:14.090
<i>But he's got a problem.</i>

18:14.760 --> 18:18.800
<i>There's that Raja again,
guarding Maya for himself.</i>

18:21.640 --> 18:24.520
<i>If Kumar knows what's good for him,</i>

18:24.560 --> 18:27.100
<i>he'll stay under the radar.</i>

18:28.270 --> 18:30.810
<i>"Nobody here, nope.</i>

18:31.480 --> 18:33.940
<i>"I'm just waiting for a friend."</i>

18:35.900 --> 18:39.570
<i>Maya is smart enough
to pretend not to care.</i>

18:40.160 --> 18:45.500
<i>Raja's position as alpha
gives him first rights in all things.</i>

18:52.090 --> 18:55.260
<i>Raja won't give Maya the time of day.</i>

18:56.050 --> 18:58.300
<i>Then, when she's
finally got an admirer,</i>

18:59.590 --> 19:01.550
<i>guess who's hanging around.</i>

19:01.600 --> 19:04.350
<i>Oh, sure. Now he's interested.</i>

19:13.650 --> 19:17.110
<i>Come on, Kumar.
Just play it cool, man.</i>

19:28.410 --> 19:30.540
<i>Kumar needs to try
something different.</i>

19:30.710 --> 19:34.130
<i>Like, maybe, I don't know, uh,</i>

19:34.710 --> 19:37.880
<i>the exact same thing
from the other side of the tree.</i>

19:40.430 --> 19:43.600
<i>No matter. Maya knows raw potential
when she sees it.</i>

19:50.100 --> 19:55.110
<i>Finally, with Raja distracted,
she takes matters into her own hands.</i>

20:21.630 --> 20:25.760
<i>"Where'd she go? What?
Wait a minute."</i>

20:46.070 --> 20:48.410
<i>Raja knows he's been tricked.</i>

20:49.370 --> 20:52.330
<i>Kumar would be wise to lay low.</i>

20:55.830 --> 20:59.550
<i>Instead, he boldly strides
back into the group,</i>

20:59.630 --> 21:01.300
<i>straight up to Raja.</i>

21:07.890 --> 21:09.770
<i>His henchmen lend their muscle.</i>

21:22.690 --> 21:24.700
<i>Kumar is expelled.</i>

21:36.370 --> 21:38.540
<i>Maya watches him retreat.</i>

21:39.170 --> 21:42.050
<i>This means goodbye.</i>

21:48.430 --> 21:52.350
<i>Maya returns
under Raja's hostile stare.</i>

21:58.150 --> 22:00.940
<i>It's back to business as usual,</i>

22:01.570 --> 22:03.440
<i>or so it would seem.</i>

22:20.540 --> 22:22.300
<i>Six months later,</i>

22:22.380 --> 22:26.050
<i>something has happened
that changes everything.</i>

22:32.810 --> 22:37.060
<i>Maya has given birth to Kumar's son.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:48.070
<i>Welcome to the world, Kip.</i>

22:53.240 --> 22:57.080
<i>Maya is consumed
by unconditional love.</i>

23:08.510 --> 23:11.510
<i>She is lost in her infant.</i>

23:24.320 --> 23:25.940
<i>To keep her milk flowing,</i>

23:25.980 --> 23:30.320
<i>Maya no longer has the option
of skipping meals.</i>

23:30.410 --> 23:35.790
<i>And with Kumar gone,
keeping Kip safe won't be easy.</i>

23:43.130 --> 23:49.510
<i>The sisters enjoy a network of nannies,
not to mention paternal support.</i>

23:50.180 --> 23:54.050
<i>Maya will have to do this on her own.</i>

24:04.560 --> 24:07.690
<i>Now more than ever,</i>

24:07.780 --> 24:11.280
<i>Maya must overcome her rank
and beat the system.</i>

24:11.360 --> 24:15.030
<i>Her son's future depends on it.</i>

24:26.540 --> 24:32.090
<i>Little Kip has arrived just in time
for monsoon season.</i>

24:43.140 --> 24:46.190
<i>If you thought taking care
of a newborn baby was hard,</i>

24:46.230 --> 24:50.110
<i>try doing it during weeks
and weeks of downpour.</i>

25:13.840 --> 25:18.010
<i>Castle Rock would make
an ideal shelter for an infant,</i>

25:18.180 --> 25:21.140
<i>but it's reserved for the VIPs,</i>

25:21.220 --> 25:22.480
<i>whose firsthand experience of rain</i>

25:22.640 --> 25:25.230
<i>is limited.</i>

25:34.110 --> 25:36.450
<i>Kip would be much better off</i>

25:36.870 --> 25:38.530
<i>under there.</i>

25:42.500 --> 25:44.410
<i>Maya can only shake it off,</i>

25:44.500 --> 25:48.710
<i>and try to prevent Kip
from getting dangerously cold.</i>

25:54.630 --> 25:57.340
<i>Few of the kingdom's creatures
enjoy the rain.</i>

26:01.970 --> 26:05.310
<i>At least the elephants
get to apply wet mud to their backs,</i>

26:05.350 --> 26:08.480
<i>which works like sunscreen
when it dries.</i>

26:22.910 --> 26:25.830
<i>Monsoon winds blowing off
the Himalayas</i>

26:26.000 --> 26:28.500
<i>have brought more rain
in the last few weeks</i>

26:28.790 --> 26:31.670
<i>than in the rest of the year combined.</i>

26:51.980 --> 26:55.030
<i>The water soaks deep into the ground.</i>

26:55.360 --> 26:58.950
<i>In a few months it'll bring a glut of fruit.</i>

26:59.030 --> 27:00.950
<i>But, before that...</i>

27:04.120 --> 27:08.370
<i>It happens for a just a few hours
every year.</i>

27:15.210 --> 27:16.880
<i>Thousands of winged termites</i>

27:17.050 --> 27:21.050
<i>take to the air to found new colonies.</i>

27:24.720 --> 27:26.060
<i>For the macaques,</i>

27:26.180 --> 27:29.560
<i>it's every holiday meal rolled into one.</i>

28:03.760 --> 28:08.350
<i>For Maya, termites have
the two best qualities in a food source,</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:11.900
<i>they are delicious,
and they are everywhere.</i>

28:30.960 --> 28:35.540
<i>Even the sisters can't
keep this feast to themselves.</i>

28:37.960 --> 28:41.550
<i>Maya has her very own mound today.</i>

28:47.310 --> 28:51.140
<i>And more food for Maya
means more milk for Kip.</i>

28:53.440 --> 28:55.060
<i>Patience, little one.</i>

28:57.650 --> 29:01.240
<i>Everyone in the kingdom
shows up for termite day.</i>

29:04.610 --> 29:09.620
<i>Even scorpions gather as much
as they can to stock the pantry.</i>

29:33.310 --> 29:36.520
<i>Finally, Kip got his fin.</i>

29:47.620 --> 29:50.870
<i>The termite feast comes
but once a year,</i>

29:51.040 --> 29:56.830
<i>which leaves Maya with 364 other days
to provide for her son.</i>

29:56.870 --> 29:58.170
<i>Her growing son.</i>

30:02.050 --> 30:04.010
<i>Kip is getting older,</i>

30:04.050 --> 30:07.180
<i>reaching that age
when he starts to realize</i>

30:07.220 --> 30:09.890
<i>he's part of a larger world.</i>

30:12.970 --> 30:16.310
<i>Meanwhile,
he's this close to understanding</i>

30:16.390 --> 30:20.730
<i>that his skin
is actually attached to his face.</i>

30:26.700 --> 30:28.410
<i>Like any mother,</i>

30:28.490 --> 30:32.080
<i>Maya probably wants
to freeze her child in time.</i>

30:32.870 --> 30:37.540
<i>This, right now, this is the perfect age.</i>

30:49.050 --> 30:50.260
<i>Insects.</i>

30:52.180 --> 30:54.100
<i>Plants. (LAUGHS</i>

30:54.430 --> 30:56.770
<i>The laws of physics.</i>

30:56.850 --> 30:58.390
<i>They'll make sense in time.</i>

30:58.440 --> 31:01.270
<i>It's monkeys that are confusing.</i>

31:01.360 --> 31:03.780
<i>Infants get a pass to be annoying</i>

31:03.860 --> 31:05.570
<i>in their early weeks.</i>

31:06.780 --> 31:10.280
<i>Older monkeys just have to
look the other way.</i>

31:13.950 --> 31:16.450
<i>Sometimes it's extremely hard.</i>

31:25.380 --> 31:28.090
<i>But not everyone plays by the rules.</i>

31:31.430 --> 31:34.600
<i>Like the sisters and Raja.</i>

31:34.640 --> 31:37.180
<i>Especially not for Maya's kid.</i>

31:45.150 --> 31:49.150
<i>And so, Kip discovers his place.</i>

31:52.660 --> 31:56.950
<i>With termite season long gone,
cassia flowers are what's on the menu.</i>

31:57.910 --> 32:01.790
<i>For Raja, the sisters,
and their children, that is.</i>

32:06.590 --> 32:11.680
<i>To feed herself and Kip today,
Maya will have to get creative.</i>

32:16.350 --> 32:19.350
<i>Maya's nothing, if not scrappy.</i>

32:20.310 --> 32:22.520
<i>She's got a plan B.</i>

32:23.100 --> 32:24.690
<i>With other hungry monkeys in tow,</i>

32:25.310 --> 32:27.530
<i>Maya takes the lead.</i>

32:30.530 --> 32:34.700
<i>It's an opportunity the high-born
wouldn't even recognize.</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:54.550
<i>The lily pond is a spot
known for predators.</i>

32:58.890 --> 33:02.190
<i>But today, the coast seems clear.</i>

33:03.980 --> 33:08.650
<i>Maya digs in, harvesting
the seed pods of water lilies.</i>

33:24.080 --> 33:27.000
<i>Grandpa will sit this one out.</i>

33:36.840 --> 33:39.600
<i>When the easy pickings are gone,</i>

33:39.760 --> 33:42.560
<i>you've gotta get
a bit more adventurous.</i>

33:48.110 --> 33:51.110
<i>Maya treads carefully.</i>

34:14.130 --> 34:16.880
<i>It's Maya who makes the first move</i>

34:16.969 --> 34:18.340
into the deeper waters.

34:18.429 --> 34:21.639
<i>Kip will go along for the ride.</i>

34:27.600 --> 34:29.810
<i>The younger monkeys follow.</i>

34:29.980 --> 34:35.949
<i>But even the bravest hesitate
over this next incredible step.</i>

34:47.670 --> 34:50.670
<i>Did you know monkeys could swim?</i>

36:01.070 --> 36:04.330
<i>For Kip, it's been a day of firsts.</i>

36:04.490 --> 36:06.080
<i>First swim lesson,</i>

36:06.240 --> 36:10.000
<i>first lily-seed pod and now, this.</i>

36:15.040 --> 36:17.250
<i>A monitor lizard.</i>

36:24.260 --> 36:28.140
<i>7 feet long, a deadly ambush predator.</i>

36:36.110 --> 36:41.070
<i>His most lethal weapon,
the element of surprise.</i>

36:51.040 --> 36:53.540
<i>Maya hasn't spotted the lizard.</i>

37:13.810 --> 37:17.270
<i>In the chaos,
Maya has gotten Kip to safety.</i>

37:17.440 --> 37:19.610
<i>But not before
one of their own has fallen.</i>

37:44.930 --> 37:48.800
<i>After a night spent
wet, cold, and shaken,</i>

37:48.850 --> 37:51.140
<i>the low-born recover.</i>

37:56.150 --> 37:59.150
<i>Maya isn't sleeping in.</i>

37:59.190 --> 38:01.320
<i>She's got a growing son to feed.</i>

38:16.870 --> 38:21.710
<i>Maya finds a patch of caterpillars,
perfect for enriching her milk.</i>

38:35.060 --> 38:37.730
<i>Kip should be eating soon enough.</i>

38:49.740 --> 38:54.370
<i>The sisters believe any food patch
is their food patch.</i>

39:02.210 --> 39:05.380
<i>They mount an attack,
driving Maya away from her son.</i>

39:13.850 --> 39:16.270
<i>Kip is stolen away.</i>

39:22.110 --> 39:26.110
<i>Maya receives her brutal punishment.</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:30.950
<i>And Kip is carried off into the forest.</i>

39:47.090 --> 39:49.300
<i>Hours pass, and still,</i>

39:49.470 --> 39:52.300
<i>Maya is looking for her son.</i>

39:56.060 --> 40:00.810
<i>On the far side of the ruined city,
the sisters keep Kip close.</i>

40:04.900 --> 40:07.780
<i>Maya calls for her lost son.</i>

40:13.990 --> 40:19.120
<i>Finally, the sisters lose interest,
and Kip is free to leave.</i>

40:34.680 --> 40:38.520
<i>Kip is lost and dangerously exposed.</i>

40:48.480 --> 40:52.110
<i>Maya has been patrolling
the territory for hours,</i>

40:52.200 --> 40:55.450
<i>straining to hear her son's calls.</i>

41:05.460 --> 41:07.460
<i>At last.</i>

41:11.630 --> 41:14.130
<i>This ordeal is over.</i>

41:31.900 --> 41:34.910
<i>The lessons of yesterday are clear.</i>

41:34.990 --> 41:36.370
<i>Maya will need another way</i>

41:36.530 --> 41:38.410
to feed her son.

41:39.990 --> 41:43.580
<i>She must head into uncharted territory.</i>

41:50.710 --> 41:51.880
<i>For today's mission,</i>

41:52.050 --> 41:55.260
<i>she brings backup,
leaving Kip safely behind</i>

41:55.430 --> 41:57.800
<i>with a fellow low-ranker.</i>

42:00.720 --> 42:04.600
<i>The upside to this score
could be enormous,</i>

42:04.770 --> 42:06.150
<i>but so are the risks.</i>

42:10.770 --> 42:13.610
<i>The predator encountered
at the edge of the forest</i>

42:13.780 --> 42:16.780
<i>is unpredictable and loud.</i>

42:18.410 --> 42:20.410
<i>The humans.</i>

42:37.010 --> 42:38.470
<i>Maya gets a glimpse.</i>

42:39.140 --> 42:41.640
<i>"Oh! They're terrifying!"</i>

42:57.490 --> 42:58.490
<i>"Hmm. "</i>

42:59.990 --> 43:02.370
<i>"Chickens. Very small brains.</i>

43:02.530 --> 43:05.040
<i>"Will they notice if we take their eggs?"</i>

43:10.330 --> 43:11.500
<i>The lookout gives the signal.</i>

43:25.520 --> 43:26.520
<i>"All clear!"</i>

43:33.320 --> 43:35.030
<i>"In. Confirming we are in."</i>

43:37.030 --> 43:39.860
<i>"No one will ever know we were here."</i>

43:40.530 --> 43:42.370
<i>"We are like ninjas."</i>

44:28.370 --> 44:30.410
<i>"They're coming. Quick, last chance!"</i>

44:36.750 --> 44:38.300
<i>"Mmm. I like pink flavor."</i>

44:38.460 --> 44:40.760
<i>"ls this even food? I don't care!"</i>

44:42.930 --> 44:44.430
<i>"Leave nothing behind, eat it all!"</i>

44:46.140 --> 44:47.600
<i>"Mm, this is good!"</i>

44:50.230 --> 44:51.440
<i>"Oh, this is delicious!"</i>

44:55.400 --> 44:57.440
<i>"Mm, cake. Love cake!"</i>

44:59.230 --> 45:00.780
<i>"Abort mission!</i>

45:02.320 --> 45:03.950
<i>"Happy birthday, kid."</i>

45:12.580 --> 45:17.340
<i>Back in the forest,
Maya is reunited with Kip.</i>

45:19.130 --> 45:21.300
<i>The underclass will retire for the night</i>

45:21.340 --> 45:24.380
<i>with an unfamiliar sensation
in their bellies.</i>

45:26.090 --> 45:28.100
<i>Fullness.</i>

46:32.870 --> 46:36.500
<i>Yesterday's raid
can't be a regular thing.</i>

46:37.210 --> 46:41.420
<i>Maya needs long-term security
for her son.</i>

46:48.590 --> 46:53.600
<i>The next morning, a lone male
surveys the edge of the kingdom.</i>

46:55.890 --> 46:58.940
<i>Maya will not be expecting this.</i>

47:01.520 --> 47:03.860
<i>Kumar is back.</i>

47:11.120 --> 47:15.200
<i>He's grown stronger
and smarter in exile.</i>

47:18.420 --> 47:20.630
<i>The young boys are playing,</i>

47:20.750 --> 47:22.420
<i>training for the day they leave the troop</i>

47:22.500 --> 47:25.340
<i>and attempt Kumar's journey.</i>

47:25.420 --> 47:29.090
<i>This could be the opening
he's been looking for.</i>

47:30.890 --> 47:33.930
<i>A way to ingratiate himself
with the troop</i>

47:34.060 --> 47:35.970
<i>and heal old wounds.</i>

47:53.120 --> 47:56.120
<i>Maya has spotted him.</i>

48:11.300 --> 48:14.010
<i>Finally, they are reunited.</i>

48:14.180 --> 48:19.020
<i>And for the first time,
Kumar meets his son.</i>

48:19.100 --> 48:24.440
<i>But if Maya's man wants to stay,
he's got work to do.</i>

48:26.940 --> 48:30.820
<i>Step one,
befriend the alpha's lieutenants.</i>

48:39.620 --> 48:42.670
<i>Step two, put in some grooming time.</i>

48:58.180 --> 49:02.850
<i>Soon, Kumar can sit back,
and the others come to him.</i>

49:06.730 --> 49:10.690
<i>But this all means nothing
without the alpha's support.</i>

49:13.860 --> 49:15.070
<i>Step three,</i>

49:15.700 --> 49:18.240
<i>make up with Raja.</i>

49:19.200 --> 49:22.710
<i>Kumar's opportunity
arrives in the form of</i>

49:23.540 --> 49:25.540
<i>jackfruit.</i>

49:28.340 --> 49:31.210
<i>Sloth bears have
the best noses in the forest,</i>

49:31.340 --> 49:33.260
<i>so they always find it first.</i>

49:35.550 --> 49:39.760
<i>Bad-tempered bears
usually keep monkeys away,</i>

49:41.520 --> 49:44.560
<i>but jackfruit
makes you forget your place.</i>

49:48.400 --> 49:51.900
<i>The sisters are quick
to remind you, though.</i>

49:54.570 --> 49:59.280
<i>Because jackfruit isn't just fruit.
It's politics.</i>

50:02.250 --> 50:04.080
<i>If Kumar's learned anything,</i>

50:04.120 --> 50:07.130
<i>he won't steal something
out from under the alpha's nose again.</i>

50:08.250 --> 50:11.090
<i>No matter how good that fruit looks.</i>

50:15.130 --> 50:18.260
<i>Maya can only watch
as the fate of Kip's father</i>

50:18.390 --> 50:20.140
<i>hangs in the balance.</i>

50:21.220 --> 50:25.350
<i>Kumar makes a move,
but it's not for the fruit.</i>

50:25.440 --> 50:28.440
<i>He offers his hand in friendship.</i>

50:39.120 --> 50:43.330
<i>And so, Maya's man
earns a seat at the table.</i>

50:52.170 --> 50:56.760
<i>Raja will soon need
Kumar's strength on his side.</i>

51:04.520 --> 51:07.810
<i>A rival group is sizing up Castle Rock.</i>

51:15.490 --> 51:18.860
<i>Lex, the leader of
this battle-hardened team.</i>

51:34.500 --> 51:37.050
<i>Raja assesses the threat.</i>

51:37.840 --> 51:40.140
<i>Maya moves Kip to safety.</i>

51:47.180 --> 51:50.350
<i>Raja and the other males
must defend the troop from invaders.</i>

51:54.190 --> 51:58.240
<i>Branch shaking is a full-on threat.</i>

52:02.870 --> 52:04.080
<i>In the heat of the moment,</i>

52:04.160 --> 52:07.040
<i>Raja leaves the high ground,
leading his troop</i>

52:07.120 --> 52:08.500
<i>to the enemy.</i>

52:13.920 --> 52:16.840
<i>Playing right into Lex's hands.</i>

52:18.210 --> 52:19.840
<i>The home team follows,</i>

52:21.930 --> 52:24.260
<i>answering Raja's call for support.</i>

52:30.440 --> 52:32.400
<i>The battle is on.</i>

52:36.610 --> 52:39.570
<i>The combat drifts further from the rock</i>

52:39.610 --> 52:41.070
<i>and into the jungle.</i>

52:47.740 --> 52:51.960
<i>Sensing easy victory, the home team
is drawn even further still.</i>

52:53.460 --> 52:55.540
<i>Lex is lying in wait.</i>

52:58.630 --> 53:00.970
<i>The enemy is ready.</i>

53:03.090 --> 53:04.590
<i>Raja's confused.</i>

53:04.640 --> 53:06.260
<i>He can only see one invader.</i>

53:15.730 --> 53:18.570
<i>Time for Lex's crew to finish the job.</i>

53:32.160 --> 53:33.460
<i>The home team is cornered.</i>

53:47.140 --> 53:50.010
<i>Raja's troop runs for its life.</i>

54:01.480 --> 54:04.820
<i>Castle Rock has a new king.</i>

54:14.500 --> 54:16.250
<i>Raja is wounded.</i>

54:16.330 --> 54:20.550
<i>Leaving the rock and taking
the fight to Lex was a costly error.</i>

54:20.630 --> 54:24.800
<i>His position as alpha
is on shaky ground now.</i>

54:27.970 --> 54:31.060
<i>Kumar has his own battle scars.</i>

54:31.180 --> 54:33.140
<i>But today, there is worse.</i>

54:36.690 --> 54:39.190
<i>The troop lost one of their own.</i>

54:40.860 --> 54:43.860
<i>Maya had known this male for years.</i>

54:44.690 --> 54:49.700
<i>It's as though she and the others
understand that this is farewell.</i>

55:29.530 --> 55:32.410
<i>They haven't just lost a friend today,</i>

55:33.080 --> 55:35.080
<i>they've lost their rock castle</i>

55:35.200 --> 55:38.460
<i>and the kingdom that sustained them
for generations.</i>

55:43.920 --> 55:46.710
<i>Maya pushes on</i>

55:46.760 --> 55:49.300
<i>as Kumar chaperones Kip.</i>

55:52.050 --> 55:54.430
<i>Finally, Maya has some protection
for her son.</i>

55:57.770 --> 56:00.730
<i>But the troop is vulnerable.</i>

56:00.770 --> 56:02.110
<i>There's nothing to eat or drink here,</i>

56:02.190 --> 56:06.070
<i>and Lex's crew could return
to finish them off.</i>

56:06.110 --> 56:08.150
<i>They must keep moving.</i>

56:13.620 --> 56:15.910
<i>Remember him?</i>

56:16.290 --> 56:18.080
<i>The low-born know a monitor,</i>

56:18.250 --> 56:21.120
<i>even out of water,
and sound the alarm.</i>

56:33.300 --> 56:36.970
<i>The nobility isn't familiar
with this creature,</i>

56:37.020 --> 56:40.440
<i>because they never needed
to visit the lily pond.</i>

56:46.820 --> 56:50.650
<i>For once,
out in this alien no man's land,</i>

56:50.740 --> 56:53.110
<i>the commoners have the edge.</i>

56:57.120 --> 57:01.500
<i>For Maya, the lizard is nothing more
than a fleeting distraction.</i>

57:10.170 --> 57:14.260
<i>With Kip in tow, she presses on,</i>

57:14.430 --> 57:17.310
<i>and the group falls into line behind her.</i>

57:23.770 --> 57:26.610
<i>The forest edge is unfamiliar terrain.</i>

57:36.620 --> 57:38.990
<i>Finally, a place to regroup.</i>

57:44.870 --> 57:49.210
<i>But plover birds don't want
the monkeys near their eggs.</i>

57:56.300 --> 58:01.720
<i>The sisters are on the receiving end
for once and they do not like it.</i>

58:06.480 --> 58:08.860
<i>Kumar leads Kip to cover</i>

58:09.900 --> 58:12.570
<i>while Maya forges ahead.</i>

58:36.260 --> 58:38.140
<i>Maya is the most equipped</i>

58:38.220 --> 58:40.140
<i>for this challenge.</i>

58:40.220 --> 58:44.020
<i>She knows some stuff about
looking for food in dangerous places.</i>

58:54.440 --> 58:56.110
<i>The first stop is a bust.</i>

58:56.780 --> 58:58.070
<i>Maya keeps moving.</i>

58:59.700 --> 59:03.290
<i>Adversity is nothing new for this girl.</i>

59:07.750 --> 59:09.380
<i>Not so for Raja.</i>

59:10.630 --> 59:13.420
<i>Others take the lead now.</i>

59:17.970 --> 59:20.800
<i>The sisters are bewildered.</i>

59:22.220 --> 59:24.720
<i>Even Grandpa fares better.</i>

59:30.980 --> 59:35.400
<i>When the troop finally enters
the urban jungle, they are ravenous.</i>

59:35.570 --> 59:39.950
<i>Using her instincts,
Maya leads them to the market.</i>

59:45.500 --> 59:47.080
<i>Kumar makes the first move.</i>

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.430
<i>He makes it look easy.</i>

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:10.270
<i>His students watch and learn.</i>

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:25.790
<i>Maya is in the thick of the action</i>

01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:28.330
<i>while Kip stays safe above.</i>

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:35.960
<i>The sisters get an A for effort.</i>

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.510
<i>Sure, there's some learning
to be done.</i>

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.510
<i>Progress, not perfection.</i>

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.580
<i>With stomachs full,</i>

01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.380
<i>the troop can explore
whatever else the city has to offer.</i>

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:18.670
<i>A seat for Grandpa.</i>

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.260
<i>A little drink from this thing.</i>

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:27.930
<i>"Uh, boy!"</i>

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.270
<i>"What is that?"</i>

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.440
<i>"It's furry, about the size of a langur."</i>

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:43.110
<i>"Do you speak monkey?"</i>

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.210
<i>"Dude, what are you?"</i>

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:56.130
<i>"It likes being groomed."</i>

01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:08.300
<i>Okay, maybe man's best friend
is also monkey's best friend.</i>

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.440
<i>"No, it's because we like to
bite each other's tails.</i>

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.110
<i>"Is that not a thing... Okay."</i>

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.920
<i>"Think he'll let me ride him?"</i>

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:42.170
<i>"Same time tomorrow?"</i>

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.930
<i>Our troop has sampled city cuisine.</i>

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:49.300
<i>Kip has even met the wildlife.</i>

01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:52.180
<i>All that's left is a place to stay.</i>

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:57.650
<i>High above the palm.
Now, that's a sleeping tree.</i>

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:11.620
<i>Kumar leads them up.</i>

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.210
<i>The troop settles in for the night,
nice and cozy.</i>

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.180
<i>Hmm. Well, it's actually
not that cozy.</i>

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.560
<i>Okay, not at all.</i>

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:40.060
<i>What Maya and Kip wouldn't give
for their wooden branch at home.</i>

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.860
<i>At least it's quiet.</i>

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:55.040
<i>"You're kidding, right?"</i>

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.080
<i>"It's gonna be a long night."</i>

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.600
<i>Nope, this won't do at all.</i>

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:18.430
<i>Castle Rock is home.</i>

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.980
<i>But before the troop can win it back,</i>

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.270
<i>they have to build up their reserves
for the tough fight ahead.</i>

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:29.030
<i>This will require
a focused assault on the town.</i>

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:54.990
<i>Wounds healed and strength regained,
the troop is ready to head home</i>

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.200
<i>and reclaim what's rightfully theirs.</i>

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.250
<i>Together, on the edge of their territory,</i>

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.380
<i>they wash away the city</i>

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.930
<i>and relish the jungle all around them.</i>

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:03.520
<i>The line between high-born
and low-born remains blurred.</i>

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.270
<i>It may not stay this way forever,
but for now,</i>

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:08.270
<i>it's enough.</i>

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.270
<i>Kip and his new friends
seem happy to be back.</i>

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.990
<i>But Maya can't relax yet.</i>

01:07:58.150 --> 01:08:01.490
<i>The hardest part of the journey
lies ahead.</i>

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.290
<i>Kumar leads the troop home.</i>

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.460
<i>Maya and Kip follow him closely.</i>

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.640
<i>The sisters, still humbled
from their time in the city,</i>

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.680
<i>trail behind them.</i>

01:08:24.010 --> 01:08:27.520
<i>Raja is no longer at the front.</i>

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.700
<i>Kumar has Castle Rock in his sights.</i>

01:08:40.279 --> 01:08:42.529
<i>The enemy is home.</i>

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.000
<i>Lex senses something is wrong.</i>

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.460
<i>Kumar remains hidden.</i>

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.050
<i>Maya has left Kip at the rear</i>

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:58.960
<i>and is close behind.</i>

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.050
<i>The soldiers assume their positions.</i>

01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:17.520
<i>The enemy still hasn't seen Kumar,
and the troop is nearly set.</i>

01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:26.080
<i>Lex can see movement,
but can't know what's coming.</i>

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.410
<i>Grandpa is going in.</i>

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:44.590
<i>Kumar makes his move.</i>

01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:48.180
<i>Not good for Lex.</i>

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:05.450
<i>Maya is on the front line.</i>

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.950
<i>Go, Grandpa!</i>

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:16.420
<i>Soon, our troop scales Castle Rock.</i>

01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:28.970
<i>Kumar lays his claim
as king of this castle.</i>

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:42.230
<i>Overpowered,
Lex and his team retreat.</i>

01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:50.990
<i>Finally, the troop is home.</i>

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.920
<i>For Maya and the troop,
it's great to be back.</i>

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:09.680
<i>First, the jungle gym.</i>

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.180
<i>Yup, still good.</i>

01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:22.610
<i>Then, it's time to catch up
with old friends.</i>

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:31.990
<i>And let's not forget you-know-who.</i>

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.040
<i>It's pretty obvious
that he has missed them.</i>

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:41.630
<i>Now,</i>

01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:44.960
<i>street smart from the town,
they collect rent from their tenants.</i>

01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:51.140
<i>"Look, we're all reasonable
forest creatures here.</i>

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.060
<i>"We're not gonna eat you,</i>

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:56.230
<i>"but we are gonna eat your fruit.</i>

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.890
<i>"So, hand it over."</i>

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.320
<i>The youngsters have
grown in confidence</i>

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.360
<i>since their urban adventure.</i>

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.990
<i>Especially Kip,</i>

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:10.700
<i>whose curiosity has blossomed.</i>

01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:30.260
<i>Castle Rock remains
a stronghold for our troop</i>

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.430
<i>as a year passes,</i>

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.220
<i>and another monsoon season
comes and goes.</i>

01:12:56.950 --> 01:13:00.580
<i>The precious fig tree is back in fruit.</i>

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.640
<i>And this time, Maya is in it.</i>

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:27.940
<i>These days, Maya enjoys
a new acceptance by the sisters.</i>

01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:29.150
<i>Then again,</i>

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.780
<i>some things never change.</i>

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.660
<i>Yeah, yeah, you're still a big deal.
We get it.</i>

01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:40.950
<i>The sisters are
still attended to by Raja,</i>

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.920
<i>but he's lost their support.</i>

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:49.760
<i>Whereas Grandpa just keeps on going,</i>

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:53.010
<i>a role model for generations
of young monkeys.</i>

01:13:56.350 --> 01:14:01.600
<i>Kip is now a well-fed
and healthy little boy.</i>

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.850
<i>He has a knack for making friends,</i>

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.440
<i>and an independence
that is growing by the day.</i>

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.950
<i>Kip isn't just surviving,</i>

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:18.870
<i>he's thriving.</i>

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:28.960
<i>Kumar, now the alpha of the troop,
snuggles against Maya</i>

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.800
<i>and their brand new baby girl.</i>

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:36.390
<i>This infant's future will be secure.</i>

01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:40.680
<i>She will know nothing of the struggle
once endured by her brother.</i>

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.650
<i>Kip now has a vibrant future
ahead of him,</i>

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.530
<i>thanks to his mother.</i>

01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:08.920
<i>Against all odds,
Maya made this possible.</i>

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.140
I think he's chasing for the jeeps.

01:16:50.310 --> 01:16:51.690
A little bit angry, eh?

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:56.190
I'm getting nice little...

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.200
They've just started emerging.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.710
You can see them behind me.

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:12.580
<i>We've had a little bit of rain,</i>

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.580
<i>and it has obviously
softened up the termite mounds.</i>

01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:16.040
<i>Some of them are coming out,</i>

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.710
<i>and the monkeys
are just picking them off.</i>

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.690
{\an8} About 17 weeks
we've been waiting for that.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:38.650
{\an8} It feels like we've been
filming here for six years.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.020
What makes this more exciting is

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:12.390
it's not just mongooses
that live down here.

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:13.940
About four weeks ago,

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.610
we saw a cobra going in and out.

01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:26.110
We're coming.
