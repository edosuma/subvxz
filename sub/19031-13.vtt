WEBVTT

00:01.041 --> 00:02.542
<i>They say that by the end</i>
<i>of your first semester</i>

00:02.606 --> 00:05.174
<i>in med school, it's already</i>
<i>obvious what kind of doctor</i>

00:05.208 --> 00:07.243
<i>you'll end up being.</i>
Him.

00:07.277 --> 00:09.244
Who... Trang?
Yep.

00:09.278 --> 00:11.779
Oh, man. Small hands,
great with the ladies... Ob-Gyn.

00:11.814 --> 00:16.849
No, more like a shopping mall
pretzel vendor. Next.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.017
Maybe Emergency Medicine.

00:19.018 --> 00:22.052
Nope! Pediatrics.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.519
There it is.
What's up?

00:23.520 --> 00:25.187
Hello.
Hey.

00:25.188 --> 00:27.789
Man, you're so lucky to have
someone like drew.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.824
I wish I could find
a stud-wannabe surgeon

00:30.825 --> 00:32.827
to take under my wing.

00:32.828 --> 00:35.396
I've been making a play
for this guy right here... Clint,

00:35.397 --> 00:37.798
but he's too cool and aloof.
See you in class. Dr. Turk.

00:37.799 --> 00:40.199
Not if I see you first! Ha!

00:40.200 --> 00:42.867
We gonna kick it!

00:42.868 --> 00:45.636
He's gonna think I'm lame.

00:45.637 --> 00:47.937
You are lame.

00:47.938 --> 00:50.238
All right, then.
Listen up, murderers.

00:50.239 --> 00:53.507
As you know, we are approaching
the end of the semester.

00:53.508 --> 00:55.474
The ceremony of thanks
is quickly approaching.

00:55.475 --> 00:58.043
That's where you publicly thank
the friends and families

00:58.044 --> 01:01.379
of the cadavers you've been
dissecting this semester.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.648
It's actually
a pretty sweet deal for em.

01:03.649 --> 01:05.882
After their loved ones
are stripped for parts

01:05.883 --> 01:07.717
like a 1998 Mitsubishi Mirage,

01:07.718 --> 01:09.918
we treat 'em
to some free cold cuts

01:09.919 --> 01:12.820
and a chance to listen to you
regurgitate some trite quotes

01:12.821 --> 01:15.723
about their
family members' sacrifice

01:15.724 --> 01:18.825
that you found on the Internet. Oh, yeah.
Uh, heads up to all you white people out there.

01:18.826 --> 01:22.394
Reciting a Maya Angelou poem
in an old black lady's voi...

01:22.395 --> 01:25.330
Not cool, okay?
Cole, I'm talkin' to you.

01:25.331 --> 01:27.331
Talkin' to you.

01:27.332 --> 01:30.634
What are you cooking?
I can smell it from next door.

01:30.635 --> 01:33.135
It's a Wild Mushroom
and Shrimp Risotto

01:33.136 --> 01:37.638
I learned to make while working at a hostel in Naples.
Risotto... that's gay for rice, right?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.306
Yeah.
Shrimp's gay for chicken.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.106
Hey, should we
get married today?

01:41.107 --> 01:44.542
What?

01:44.543 --> 01:46.577
We've been dating
for four months.

01:46.578 --> 01:49.545
I mean, it's pretty good, right?
Let's stop screwing around

01:49.546 --> 01:51.580
and just get it over with.
Who cares?

01:51.581 --> 01:54.349
Okay, obviously your diet
of power bars and boxed wine

01:54.350 --> 01:55.783
has scrambled your brain.

01:55.784 --> 01:58.251
We got as great thing
going here, you know?

01:58.252 --> 02:02.054
Why mess with it? Yeah, you're probably right.
It was just an idea.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.223
Okay. Let's make a baby instead.

02:05.224 --> 02:08.725
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

02:08.726 --> 02:13.795
I'm on my birth control...
I think.

02:13.796 --> 02:16.563
Yeah. Uh...

02:16.564 --> 02:19.565
How great is this
cadaver ceremony gonna be?

02:19.566 --> 02:21.901
We have to start planning
what we're gonna do for...

02:21.902 --> 02:24.869
You know who. You know, he
can't actually hear you. He is a corpse.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.438
I am just
excited to honor his memory.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.372
I don't see
what the big deal is.

02:29.373 --> 02:32.040
People die in third world
countries all the time,

02:32.041 --> 02:34.275
and no one cares.
Since when did you become so political?

02:34.276 --> 02:37.144
Since my boy Trent went on
a surf vacation to El Salvador

02:37.145 --> 02:38.779
and got a tattoo infection.

02:38.780 --> 02:41.682
He had to die with a partial
mermaid on his shoulder.

02:41.683 --> 02:43.883
It just looked like
a regular stupid lady.

02:43.884 --> 02:46.985
Where was his ceremony?
Am I the only one that cares

02:46.986 --> 02:49.920
about doing something nice for Ben?
Lucy, it's not that we don't care.

02:49.921 --> 02:53.156
I actually do not care.
It's just that with the semester ending,

02:53.157 --> 02:55.290
we all have a lot on our plate,

02:55.291 --> 02:57.091
and the cadaver ceremony
didn't make the top of the list.

02:57.092 --> 03:00.561
Guys, just do me a favor, okay?
Come up with one thing

03:00.562 --> 03:02.763
that's important to you
about Ben. That's it.

03:02.764 --> 03:06.532
It could be a poem or a lightly
choreographed dance number.

03:06.533 --> 03:09.501
Don't be afraid to go modern.
I think Ben would appreciate it.

03:09.502 --> 03:12.069
Fine. Or you could
just bring some pretzels

03:12.070 --> 03:13.904
or something.

03:13.905 --> 03:16.105
Well, Cole, everything looks great

03:16.106 --> 03:17.673
two weeks out,
the wound's healed.

03:17.674 --> 03:20.742
Test results came back clean.
Your cancer's gone.

03:20.743 --> 03:22.877
That is so crazy.

03:22.878 --> 03:25.278
You know, I-I've always known
that a surgeon might hook me up

03:25.279 --> 03:27.980
with some sweet calf
implants or a robot arm. Mm.

03:27.981 --> 03:30.215
But I never thought one
would save my life.

03:30.216 --> 03:32.383
I'm not gonna lie.
Surgeons are pretty awesome.

03:32.384 --> 03:34.618
Hey, Dr. T.,
do you believe in fate?

03:34.619 --> 03:36.619
You know, like,
the stuff they talk about

03:36.620 --> 03:38.421
during the boring parts
of "Lost"?

03:38.422 --> 03:41.256
Well, I was thinking that maybe
I got cancer for a reason.

03:41.257 --> 03:43.624
Like... like somebody up there
is telling me

03:43.625 --> 03:46.660
that I'm supposed to be a surgeon!
Oh, Cole, you don't want to be a surgeon.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.395
Now just a second there, Gandhi.
You've been looking

03:49.396 --> 03:51.696
for a protégé, and the good lord
answered your prayers.

03:51.697 --> 03:54.398
Oh, Dr. t., I would kill
to be your protégé!

03:54.399 --> 03:56.833
You don't want to be
a surgeon, Cole. Okay?

03:56.834 --> 03:58.834
It's boring and it sucks.

03:58.835 --> 04:02.503
It's the complete opposite of a waterslide!
Dr. Turk is right.

04:02.504 --> 04:05.439
You'd... you'd hate it...
All the blood and guts.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.539
It's like
an amazing horror movie.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.374
I love horror movies!

04:09.375 --> 04:12.042
Well, sure, but you'd have
to wear a mask like a ninja,

04:12.043 --> 04:14.577
and who wants to do that?

04:14.578 --> 04:16.911
Last Halloween
I was a slutty ninja.

04:16.913 --> 04:19.747
Oh, this is gonna be awesome!

04:19.748 --> 04:21.749
I'm more sure about
wanting to be a surgeon

04:21.750 --> 04:24.284
than I've ever been
about anything ever.

04:24.285 --> 04:26.552
Okay. I gotta go update
my facebook status.

04:26.553 --> 04:29.553
But then I'm gonna come back,
and I'm gonna start

04:29.554 --> 04:31.954
shadowing you, and I'm never
gonna leave your side.

04:31.955 --> 04:34.122
You're happy, aren't you?

04:34.123 --> 04:36.157
I don't know about happy,
but darn it all,

04:36.158 --> 04:39.526
I feel alive
for the first time.

04:39.527 --> 04:41.561
And that's nice.

04:41.562 --> 04:43.763
So nice.

04:43.764 --> 04:48.066
? I can't do this
all on my own ?

04:48.067 --> 04:49.800
? no, I know ?

04:49.801 --> 04:51.802
? I'm no Superman ?

04:51.803 --> 04:54.804
sync dny238
www.Addict7ed.Com

04:54.805 --> 04:58.606
? I'm no Superman ?

04:58.631 --> 05:00.297
all right.

04:59.747 --> 05:02.648
I am so excited to see what
we've all written about Ben.

05:02.648 --> 05:05.724
Pass 'em up.
Really? Nothing?

05:07.878 --> 05:09.737
Ah. Thank you, drew.

05:09.737 --> 05:14.073
This is a
receipt for a pair of pants.

05:14.073 --> 05:16.086
Yeah, well, I didn't want
to leave you hanging,

05:16.086 --> 05:17.184
and I'm gonna need that back.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.490
I'm probably gonna
return those pants.

05:18.831 --> 05:20.109
They were skinny jeans,
and I couldn't pull 'em off.

05:20.109 --> 05:22.218
Literally took me like
an hour to pull 'em off.

05:23.286 --> 05:24.965
Guys, we've gotta come
up with something good.

05:24.965 --> 05:26.472
The other groups
are way ahead of us.

05:27.149 --> 05:33.208
?

05:35.556 --> 05:38.555
they think they're so badass
just 'cause <i>Ron</i> had

05:38.555 --> 05:41.660
a vestigial tail
and spinal meningitis.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.103
Ben could have had that tail.

05:43.103 --> 05:45.245
He's just not a show-off
like <i>ron.</i>

05:45.245 --> 05:47.210
134
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:50,817
Cole, you're all up under me.
You need to back up, all right?

05:50.817 --> 05:52.862
I mean, you smell great,
but I don't think

05:52.862 --> 05:55.520
I should know that about you.
Yeah, no, I'm sorry, Dr. t.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.827
It's just I-I'm so psyched
about this surgery thing.

05:59.547 --> 06:01.309
I already know what I'm gonna
call my surgical practice...

06:01.978 --> 06:03.457
"Cole cutz."

06:03.457 --> 06:05.415
With a "z"?
That's right!

06:05.415 --> 06:10.057
Man, you gotta knock
before you enter Cole's brain.

06:10.057 --> 06:12.545
Okay. Well, why don't you go
upstairs and get me some stuff?

06:12.545 --> 06:15.126
Yeah, yeah. What kind of stuff?
Everything that's up there.

06:15.126 --> 06:16.394
Done!
All right.

06:18.441 --> 06:19.067
Dude!

06:19.067 --> 06:21.073
Don't worry about Cole,
all right?

06:21.073 --> 06:23.385
He never sticks with anything.
He said he was gonna learn

06:23.385 --> 06:25.279
a new bone in the body every day
until he figured out that

06:25.279 --> 06:28.072
the penis wasn't actually
one of 'em and quit. Hmm.

06:28.072 --> 06:32.017
Just be tough on him.
He'll bail.

06:32.051 --> 06:35.620
So you want to be a surgeon,
huh?

06:35.654 --> 06:36.698
Well, then you need
to understand

06:36.698 --> 06:38.495
that it's not about glamour
or money

06:38.495 --> 06:40.903
or even making a great mix cd
for the o.

06:40.903 --> 06:43.760
Surgery is long,
tedious and boring.

06:43.760 --> 06:46.557
Oh, I get it...
Like episodes of "Entourage"

06:46.557 --> 06:47.498
that revolve around Turtle.

06:47.498 --> 06:49.775
Sometimes you have
to stand totally still

06:49.775 --> 06:51.849
and stay completely lasered in,

06:51.849 --> 06:53.917
even if it means
just holding this clamp,

06:53.917 --> 06:55.364
because this clamp
right here...

06:55.364 --> 06:57.669
This clamp could
keep someone alive.

06:57.669 --> 06:59.512
That's what you're gonna
practice right now. 164
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:03,428
You think you can handle it?
I'll stay here as long as it takes.

07:03.428 --> 07:05.700
I'll even cancel my 5:30
at the tanning salon.

07:05.700 --> 07:09.142
Cole, you had skin cancer,
like, yesterday!

07:09.177 --> 07:11.344
Just hold the damn clamp.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.108
What the...

07:15.108 --> 07:17.691
Oh, there you are.
Can you believe this?

07:17.691 --> 07:20.741
Apparently, there's water damage
in the wall or something.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.823
Yeah, I heard about that.

07:21.823 --> 07:24.655
Some guy upstairs cracks
his head open in the shower,

07:24.655 --> 07:26.777
lies there for four hours,
and we gotta pay the price.

07:26.777 --> 07:29.784
You think they'll be able
to fix it?

07:29.784 --> 07:32.268
Could be kinda cool, right?

07:32.268 --> 07:34.991
I mean,
instead of my crappy room

07:34.991 --> 07:38.314
and your crappy room, we could
have one giant crappy suite.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.536
I mean, it'd be kind of like
we're living together, yeah?

07:42.900 --> 07:43.789
Yeah.

07:44.556 --> 07:45.546
Yeah, that's exactly
what it'd be like.

07:48.681 --> 07:49.199
Exactly.

07:50.417 --> 07:51.194
Exactly like that.

07:52.598 --> 07:53.578
Exactly.

07:55.952 --> 07:58.577
<i>I was really excited, because</i>
<i>i'd done a bunch of research</i>

07:58.577 --> 08:00.155
<i>about Ben's life,</i>
<i>and I couldn't wait</i>

08:00.155 --> 08:03.725
<i>to share it with the group.
</i> Cole, did you know Ben was president

08:03.725 --> 08:07.362
of the association
for independent dry cleaners

08:07.396 --> 08:10.031
for the midatlantic region
from 1973 to 1976?

08:10.066 --> 08:12.934
Woman, can't you see
I'm in surgery?

08:12.969 --> 08:15.270
Uh, no.

08:15.304 --> 08:18.193
Can other people see that? Look, I'm sorry.
I don't have time for this.

08:18.193 --> 08:22.277
Go bother drew.

08:22.311 --> 08:24.802
Okay, now I know
you're not excited about Ben,

08:24.802 --> 08:26.759
but would it change things
at all if I told you

08:26.759 --> 08:29.731
that he had a time-share
in myrtle beach? Wow!

08:29.731 --> 08:31.736
So he got to spend
two weeks a year,

08:31.736 --> 08:33.895
one of them off-peak,
in South Carolina's

08:33.895 --> 08:35.775
third most popular
vacation destination?

08:35.775 --> 08:37.467
Ho, ho! Game-changer.

08:37.467 --> 08:40.025
Heads up.
Oh!

08:40.025 --> 08:43.957
So you're bringing
some of your stuff in. Good.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.765
Yeah, I'm just gonna keep this
on your bed for a while,

08:46.765 --> 08:48.282
since we always sleep
in mine anyway.

08:48.282 --> 08:50.296
And until they fix the hole,
I figured this area could

08:50.296 --> 08:53.460
kind of be like
a den/hangout/place

08:53.460 --> 08:55.426
where we have dirty sex on
top of my hockey equipment.

08:55.426 --> 08:57.466
Oh, honey, Lucy's here.

08:57.466 --> 09:00.030
Oh, I'm sorry.
I should clarify.

09:00.030 --> 09:01.932
The sex is actually
pretty vanilla.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.681
It's the hockey equipment
that's dirty.

09:03.681 --> 09:07.631
God, I am liking this.
Yeah! Yeah, me, too.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.847
I'll be back in a jiff.
Okay.

09:08.847 --> 09:14.209
I don't like this at all.
I like things clean and simple.

09:14.209 --> 09:15.641
Everything I own
is in that box.

09:15.641 --> 09:18.373
A hat, some ramen
and a car battery?

09:18.373 --> 09:21.732
Don't you have personal things?
I've had that car battery a long time.

09:25.508 --> 09:26.432
218
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,396
Cole?
I totally forgot about you.

09:30.396 --> 09:31.864
Have you been standing here
all day?

09:31.864 --> 09:34.410
I don't know.
I can't read old people clocks.

09:34.410 --> 09:37.378
And you haven't moved once,
not even to pee?

09:37.378 --> 09:39.479
Nope. I learned
a trick at keggers.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.731
When there's a long line
at the bathroom...

09:40.731 --> 09:44.686
Let a little out, let it dry.
Little out, let it dry.

09:44.686 --> 09:48.535
Didn't I say that he has what
it takes to be a surgeon?

09:48.535 --> 09:51.475
Beyond the blind sense of
entitlement and complete lack

09:51.475 --> 09:54.859
of human empathy, there's
the empty-headed concentration,

09:54.859 --> 09:56.670
the unjustifiable arrogance

09:56.670 --> 10:00.230
and the sheer willingness
to stand in one place

10:00.230 --> 10:03.330
and wet yourself
like a zoo elephant.

10:04.309 --> 10:05.386
That's awe-inspiring stuff.

10:06.242 --> 10:07.544
Thank you, Dr. c.!

10:07.544 --> 10:11.100
I've proved myself, right?
So let's go open a brother up!

10:11.100 --> 10:13.561
First of all,
why it gotta be a brother?

10:13.561 --> 10:15.289
And second of all,

10:15.289 --> 10:18.300
a surgeon has to have a delicate
touch and steady hand.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.151
Now I want you
to take these tweezers

10:21.151 --> 10:23.094
and remove the fortune
from this cookie

10:23.094 --> 10:26.637
without breaking it. I can do that.
Check out these brows.

10:26.637 --> 10:29.493
I know my way around
a pair of twzies, mm!

10:32.095 --> 10:35.090
Is that bright? Huh?
Is it bright? Is it too bright?

10:35.090 --> 10:37.037
Lots of distractions
in surgery.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.899
Blood everywhere... ooh!

10:40.899 --> 10:42.475
And out of nowhere,
there could come a noise

10:42.475 --> 10:44.150
to just break
your concentration!

10:44.150 --> 10:46.318
?

10:51.731 --> 10:53.147
a drum line in the O.R.!

10:53.575 --> 10:54.954
<i>What?</i>

11:00.068 --> 11:01.246
Done.
Mm?

11:01.246 --> 11:02.986
Somebody snare me.

11:02.986 --> 11:04.889
?

11:07.611 --> 11:08.513
I want you to imagine

11:08.513 --> 11:10.749
these bears were
in a horrible accident

11:10.749 --> 11:13.216
like a bus crash,
and before you ask,

11:13.216 --> 11:15.415
no, I don't know why
the bears were on a bus.

11:15.415 --> 11:17.750
Maybe they're super smart
government bears

11:17.750 --> 11:21.809
on their way to fight terrorism.
Anyway, all you need to do

11:21.809 --> 11:23.752
is sew one of
these bad boys up before me,

11:23.752 --> 11:26.536
and I'll know you have
the skills to be a surgeon.

11:26.536 --> 11:28.295
Are we clear?
As a vodka tonic.

11:32.902 --> 11:33.955
I'm really disappointed
in you guys.

11:33.955 --> 11:37.660
All you had to do was write one
measly little line about Ben,

11:37.751 --> 11:41.220
and you couldn't handle that.
What are we gonna do about this?

11:41.254 --> 11:43.956
We're not gonna do anything.
We gotta bounce.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.524
Maya's treating me to dinner. Yeah.
It's Vietnamese Valentine's day.

11:45.559 --> 11:47.726
It's not real.

11:47.761 --> 11:49.862
Yeah, I gotta go, too.

11:49.896 --> 11:51.831
I gotta figure out
what I'm gonna do

11:51.865 --> 11:53.468
about the giant hole
in my wall.

11:53.468 --> 11:54.899
Sadly, that's not a metaphor.

11:56.278 --> 11:59.020
Stop! You guys we have only
been here one semester,

11:59.020 --> 12:00.890
and we're already
becoming jaded.

12:01.813 --> 12:04.853
Before Ben was our homework,
he was a real human being

12:04.853 --> 12:08.081
with a job and a wife
and a son Eric,

12:08.081 --> 12:09.758
who's gonna be here tomorrow.

12:10.454 --> 12:11.582
Fine.

12:11.582 --> 12:13.113
I'll do it myself.

12:14.615 --> 12:17.185
<i>Saying how you feel</i>
<i>can be tricky.</i>

12:17.185 --> 12:19.956
<i>Some people will do anything</i>
<i>to hide their true emotions...</i>

12:19.956 --> 12:21.540
What's the big surprise?

12:23.745 --> 12:25.456
Oh.

12:26.125 --> 12:26.747
Curtain.

12:26.747 --> 12:31.717
Yeah. I put this in so we can
maintain our separate zones.

12:32.180 --> 12:33.891
What if I want
to come see my stuff?

12:34.366 --> 12:37.368
That's the best part.
It's all back in your closet.

12:38.212 --> 12:40.109
So, cool.

12:40.109 --> 12:41.236
We're good.

12:41.236 --> 12:42.849
Um, what do you want
to do tonight?

12:43.765 --> 12:46.564
Want to get married? Ha ha.
Remember that?

12:47.969 --> 12:50.976
<i>While others have</i>
<i>no probl telling you</i>

12:50.976 --> 12:52.444
<i>exactly what's on their mind.</i>

12:53.692 --> 12:54.705
Done!

12:54.705 --> 12:56.619
Wow. I'm not even close.

12:56.619 --> 12:59.507
Oh, man.
That bear's in bad shape.

12:59.507 --> 13:01.032
That's sad, Cole.

13:01.032 --> 13:03.628
Looks like being
a surgeon's just not for you.

13:06.889 --> 13:09.812
<i>And sometimes</i>
<i>you're so excited</i>

13:09.812 --> 13:14.425
<i>to tell someone</i> <i>your feelings...
</i> Excuse me.

13:14.425 --> 13:15.878
Are you Ben Coleman's son?
Yeah.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.969
Hi. I'm Lucy Bennett.

13:18.969 --> 13:21.317
We worked with your father
in our Anatomy class,

13:21.317 --> 13:24.233
and, um, I'm sort of in charge
of our group's tribute to him.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.855
And I just want to know

13:25.855 --> 13:27.112
if there's anything
you wanted us to include.

13:27.854 --> 13:30.776
<i>That you never consider they</i>
<i>might not feel the same way.</i>

13:30.776 --> 13:34.584
Well, how about that he was
a miserable, horrible dad

13:34.584 --> 13:36.032
who pretty much ruined
my childhood,

13:36.032 --> 13:38.070
and I'm only here to see him
put in the ground?

13:38.915 --> 13:40.791
I guess I could work that in.

13:43.911 --> 13:45.745
<i>Over the next 20 minutes,</i>
<i>Eric regaled me</i>

13:45.780 --> 13:48.148
<i>with horrible stories</i>
<i>about Ben.</i>

13:48.182 --> 13:50.283
He was never around
when I was a kid.

13:50.318 --> 13:52.185
He cheated on my mom.

13:52.220 --> 13:54.087
He didn't call me for 20 years.

13:54.155 --> 13:58.925
Okay, <i>but</i> you gotta admit
he was an excellent bowler.

13:58.960 --> 14:01.795
I found a photo from when
he rolled that perfect game

14:01.829 --> 14:03.363
on June 16, 1976.

14:03.397 --> 14:06.500
So that's where he was
on my 7th birthday.

14:06.534 --> 14:08.769
<i>Oh, balls.</i>

14:08.803 --> 14:12.572
Dr. Cox, I don't know what I'm
gonna do about this ceremony.

14:12.607 --> 14:15.977
I had this whole... da-da-da-da-da-da.
No sitting.

14:16.011 --> 14:19.947
Can't you see I'm reading
a very important chart here?

14:19.981 --> 14:21.348
A british tabloid?

14:21.382 --> 14:24.684
This <i>chart</i> functions
as my shield

14:24.719 --> 14:27.321
to protect me from those
who would annoy me.

14:27.355 --> 14:29.322
Hey, Dr. C.
Shield on.

14:29.357 --> 14:31.858
Ohh. See what you've done?

14:31.893 --> 14:34.495
You have destroyed
the shieldlike power

14:34.530 --> 14:36.497
of my chart.
330
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:39,567
I, um, I guess starting tomorrow
I'll be shadowing you again.

14:39.602 --> 14:42.704
I decided that surgery
is not really my thing.

14:42.739 --> 14:46.942
No, no. You are suosed
to be with Dr. Turk.

14:46.976 --> 14:48.377
Where is Dr. Turk?

14:48.411 --> 14:50.512
Oh, <i>Gandhu,</i> step away
from the pizza pastry,

14:50.547 --> 14:52.782
would you please?

14:52.816 --> 14:55.818
Yeah, but the chemicals taste
better when it's hot, so...

14:55.852 --> 14:58.821
Fair enough. I've come to
clear up a point of confusion.

14:58.855 --> 15:01.791
<i>This</i> is what a protégé
<i>should</i> look like.

15:01.825 --> 15:05.728
It is an empty vessel that
I'm filling with knowledge.

15:05.763 --> 15:07.597
I also get to hold stuff.

15:07.632 --> 15:09.499
Cole didn't have
what it takes, all right?

15:09.534 --> 15:12.769
We surgeons are an elite crew.
Really? Say, Todd, do me a favor.

15:12.803 --> 15:15.138
Would you tell me what that
wonderful new invention is

15:15.172 --> 15:17.807
you've been working on?
It's a series of erotic novelty wines...

15:17.842 --> 15:21.377
Chardonn-gay, sauvignon donk,
teeny-weeny peeny grigio.

15:21.411 --> 15:23.413
Patent pending five.

15:23.447 --> 15:24.914
Drink up, boys.

15:24.982 --> 15:26.615
Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

15:26.650 --> 15:29.685
You surgeons truly are
the chosen ones.

15:29.719 --> 15:31.687
Come on. He wasn't
even serious about it.

15:31.721 --> 15:36.191
I bet he's already moved on.
Actually, he hasn't. He's still practicing.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.594
353
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:41,897

15:41.931 --> 15:44.400
I can fix it.

15:44.434 --> 15:46.201
And the worst part is,

15:46.236 --> 15:49.372
I had to stay in that room
for 17 horse funerals.

15:49.406 --> 15:54.877
Okay, so young Cole may
not be an <i>ideal</i> protégé.

15:54.911 --> 15:56.445
He may not even be
an ideal human.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.016
Nevertheless, you don't get to
pick who needs <i>you</i> as a mentor.

16:00.050 --> 16:03.119
Do you realize,
for the last eight years

16:03.153 --> 16:06.255
I've been saddled with
a whiny, clingy lady-man

16:06.290 --> 16:09.792
whose very life force
was dependent on hugs?

16:09.826 --> 16:12.127
Now, of course,
I have young drew,

16:12.162 --> 16:15.397
and although he may be filled
with a bubbling rage

16:15.432 --> 16:18.667
that I fear cannot be
contained very much longer,

16:18.701 --> 16:21.236
at least he doesn't
need me to hold his hand

16:21.271 --> 16:23.372
when he speaks of love
and his true feelings.

16:23.407 --> 16:26.509
The point is, we don't always
get to choose who deserves

16:26.543 --> 16:29.512
and who wants our help.
That's it.

16:29.546 --> 16:32.248
Why you gotta always ruin
pastry time?

16:32.282 --> 16:35.284
Perfectly good pastry.

16:40.558 --> 16:43.026
Dr. Cox,
can I ask you something?

16:43.061 --> 16:44.895
Yes?

16:44.929 --> 16:47.864
When you're in love, h-how
do you set aside your fears

16:47.899 --> 16:51.335
so that you can just dive in
and follow your heart?

16:51.369 --> 16:55.139
Oh, dear God, drew.
Not you.

16:55.173 --> 16:57.608
It's happening again.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.343
It's happening again.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.550
Ben?

17:05.585 --> 17:08.987
I am very upset with you.
You tricked me...

17:09.021 --> 17:11.757
All old and cute on the outside

17:11.790 --> 17:14.760
and horrible and cruel
on the inside.

17:14.794 --> 17:17.863
I was planning
an amazing tribute for you...

17:17.896 --> 17:21.532
Stories and poems
and a dozen purple balloons

17:21.567 --> 17:23.867
to signify a cluster of grapes.

17:23.903 --> 17:26.037
Well, now I'm gonna pop them

17:26.071 --> 17:29.373
so they look like raisins,
nature's saddest fruit...

17:29.408 --> 17:31.843
All shriveled and dr

17:31.877 --> 17:33.811
hey. Stop being weird.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.381
I'm trying to eat my sandwich
around some corpses.

17:36.415 --> 17:38.383
Why are you eating lunch
in here?

17:38.417 --> 17:40.685
Why are you yelling
at a dead guy?

17:40.719 --> 17:43.188
See? We all got
a lot of questions.

17:43.222 --> 17:45.190
I'm yelling at Ben
because I made

17:45.257 --> 17:47.592
this really beautiful tribute
for him,

17:47.627 --> 17:50.328
and it turns out he was a jerk.
So? Did he have all his parts?

17:50.362 --> 17:52.898
Yeah. Were you able to
slice through his tendons,

17:52.932 --> 17:54.232
soft through
his lower intestines

17:54.267 --> 17:57.135
and study the anatomy of his
right hepatic flexure? Yes.

17:57.170 --> 18:00.205
Then he was exactly
who he was supposed to be.

18:00.239 --> 18:03.441
Who cares if he was
a jerk in real life?

18:03.476 --> 18:05.377
<i>You have to learn to adjust</i>

18:05.411 --> 18:07.879
<i>when your expectations</i>
<i>don't match the reality.</i>

18:07.913 --> 18:11.282
<i>Whether it's about the present</i>
<i>state of a relationship...</i>

18:11.316 --> 18:12.717
What are you doing?

18:12.751 --> 18:17.122
I'm taking down the curtain.
Sorry I was such a jerk.

18:17.156 --> 18:20.058
It's just sometimes
the tiniest changes terrify me,

18:20.092 --> 18:23.027
and I just need a little time
to process things.

18:23.062 --> 18:25.062
But eventually, I come around.

18:25.097 --> 18:28.066
? in the morning
and everything was gone ?

18:28.100 --> 18:30.835
is this a, uh, sledgehammer?

18:30.870 --> 18:33.205
Is what a sledgehammer?

18:33.239 --> 18:35.674
? dead in the hallway ?

18:35.709 --> 18:37.343
this sledgehammer.

18:37.377 --> 18:40.313
? oh, come on, sun,
why must I burn? ?

18:40.348 --> 18:43.650
you're the one who put
the hole in the wall.

18:43.684 --> 18:45.519
I may have.

18:45.553 --> 18:49.155
Look, I mean,
room and board is expensive.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.991
I think that we should
live together next year.

18:52.026 --> 18:55.394
So this was my way of
easing you into it, you know?

18:55.429 --> 18:58.230
Getting you comfortable
with the idea.

18:58.265 --> 19:03.002
I'm curious to see
whether it worked.

19:03.036 --> 19:05.270
This is where you say...

19:05.305 --> 19:08.173
I'm in love with a sociopath?

19:08.207 --> 19:09.774
Wrong. Yes or no.

19:09.809 --> 19:12.343
I mean, it's your life.
Sort of.

19:12.378 --> 19:14.245
428
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,347
? but I lived and I learned ?

19:16.381 --> 19:18.316
yes.

19:18.350 --> 19:21.719
? yes, I lived and I learned ?

19:21.754 --> 19:25.056
<i>or your expectations</i>
<i>about a person's future...</i>

19:25.091 --> 19:26.992
Hey, Cole, you got a sec?

19:27.026 --> 19:29.427
Listen, I've been thinking
about it,

19:29.461 --> 19:30.862
and amazingly enough,

19:30.896 --> 19:33.398
the same things that make you
a complete douche

19:33.432 --> 19:36.667
also give you the potential
to be a good surgeon,

19:36.702 --> 19:39.504
so, uh, it'd be an honor
to teach you,

19:39.538 --> 19:42.674
<i>if</i> that's something
you really want.

19:42.708 --> 19:46.778
It might be the first thing
I've ever really wanted.

19:46.813 --> 19:49.748
Don't get all mushy, all right?
441
00:19:49,783 --> 00:19:53,819
<i>Or even your expectations</i>
<i>about somebody's past.</i>

19:53.854 --> 19:56.855
I met Ben
on my first day of med school

19:56.890 --> 20:00.158
at a moment when I wasn't
really sure if I would make it.

20:00.193 --> 20:03.996
But the truth is,
I didn't really know Ben.

20:04.031 --> 20:06.432
In life,
I'm sure he had his faults,

20:06.466 --> 20:09.969
but in death,
he did great things.

20:10.004 --> 20:13.139
He brought us together
and helped us realize

20:13.173 --> 20:15.975
that we couldn't do it all
on our own.

20:16.009 --> 20:20.179
He gave us the confidence
to believe in ourselves...

20:20.213 --> 20:24.684
And he gave his body
so that we could become doctors.

20:24.718 --> 20:27.454
And for that, we thank him.

20:27.488 --> 20:29.757
453
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:32,993
?

20:37.799 --> 20:40.934
oh, come on!

20:44.806 --> 20:46.274
Hey, Clint, so, uh...

20:46.308 --> 20:48.208
What you got planned
this weekend?

20:48.243 --> 20:51.211
Just going to see the eels. Oh, really?
You're a member of the aquarium, too?

20:51.246 --> 20:53.713
Those annual fees
are so worth it.

20:53.747 --> 20:56.215
My daughters and I...
We love the sea turtles.

20:56.250 --> 20:59.786
They're slow in the body
but fast in the mind, right?

20:59.821 --> 21:02.255
Lightning fast! Yeah, I was
actually talking about the band, the eels.

21:02.290 --> 21:06.126
Oh. Rock music! Rock...
What am I doing?

21:06.161 --> 21:08.828
