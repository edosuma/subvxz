00:01.585 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:08.634 --> 00:10.009
You want to bounce?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.014
Welcome back to All Saints.

00:15.099 --> 00:17.517
Yeah? Really?

00:17.601 --> 00:20.061
When I get nervous,
I act out with inappropriate sexual touches.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.479
It's like Tourette's.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.065
You need to promise me
that we're not gonna take that money.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.359
Okay, I promise.

00:26.652 --> 00:29.278
He finally agreed to let you
set up a college fund for the girls.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.701
If I believed in crying at work,
I would be tearing up. I'm thrilled!

00:35.202 --> 00:36.577
-Who's seen this?
-Half of ortho.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.329
Meanwhile, my follow-ups
keep getting pushed.

00:38.414 --> 00:40.581
Yeah, well, fuck that.
You need to see a specialist.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.083
My mistake.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.836
I don't know whose MRI you saw,
but it wasn't hers.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.129
Yes, I understand that.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.049
Listen, you are not helping him.
He needs calm. Go. I got it. Please.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.035
I am so excited, too.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.663
And, yes, we will leave
the second I get home. I promise.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.876
No, I am twice as excited as you are.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.253
Okay. Have a good day at school, sweetie,

02:09.338 --> 02:12.340
and I'll see you later. I love you, too.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.134
And Dr. O'Hara says hi. Okay. Bye-bye.

02:19.097 --> 02:23.351
Jackie, I need to talk to you.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.394
Okay, great. Is later okay?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.271
Just, I'm in the middle of
about eight things right now.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.523
-Thor, take this stuff...
-It's important.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.149
...and give it to the guy in five, okay?

02:30.234 --> 02:32.777
-Jackie!
-All right. Okay, okay, okay. I promise.

02:40.536 --> 02:43.037
Hey, Zoey. Good to see you.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.248
Thor. Jackie.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.501
So great to have Eddie back.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.045
Akalitus finally got something right
for a change.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.258
Listen, Thor, I gotta get out of here
on time today.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.384
Going someplace fun tonight?

02:56.468 --> 02:58.719
Yes, tonight, tomorrow,
maybe the next day.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.888
If you're running away, can I go, too?

03:05.269 --> 03:07.144
-Should we go to my office?
-Later, I promise.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.646
Jackie, your MRI.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.232
-Like I need this shit.
-Right?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.618
Zoey, listen.
I need to get out of here early today.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.871
-Okay. How early?
-Like, now early.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.914
Oh, my God,
you're asking me to cover for you?

03:26.999 --> 03:29.292
-I've dreamt of this day.
-Okay, go. Just go.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.139
Honey, hi. Are the kids on the bus yet?

03:44.349 --> 03:48.269
Great. Do me a favor,
put them in the car and come and get me.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.688
Yeah, road trip starts right now.

03:50.772 --> 03:53.024
Do me a favor?
Explain to Grace about playing hooky,

03:53.108 --> 03:54.400
so she doesn't lose her shit.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.946
I know. I love you, too. I can't wait.
Okay, bye.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.181
Down!

04:49.289 --> 04:50.665
Sam called.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.542
Yeah, I saw that.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.255
-It's getting a little weird, huh?
-Why?

04:59.174 --> 05:02.259
'Cause I gotta see the guy every day.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.513
And 'cause you're his girlfriend.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.391
People need to expand their minds.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.268
And I need to break up with him.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.354
Why? He's a nice guy.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.314
He's a nurse.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.524
Yeah.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.613
All right, we are up to the letter "E."

05:22.698 --> 05:24.949
Who sees something that
starts with the letter "E"?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.575
That's a tough one.

05:26.910 --> 05:30.329
I see an eagle.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.289
No, you don't.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.457
Maybe a hawk or an owl,

05:33.542 --> 05:37.086
but the eagle population in New York State
has pretty much vanished.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.673
Wow, Grace. You are just
getting smarter and smarter every day.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.093
Yeah, but I'm missing
an Old Testament quiz.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.345
Is that good or bad?

05:46.930 --> 05:48.097
Good.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.642
Well, you can thank Mommy for that.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.146
You can, you know. I know you can do it.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.772
Say, "Thanks, Mom."

05:56.857 --> 05:58.232
Thanks, Mom.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.568
My pleasure.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.578
-Anybody seen Jackie?
-She left for the day.

06:11.288 --> 06:15.374
-For the day?
-Yep. I am covering for her.

06:17.294 --> 06:18.836
How convenient.

06:23.633 --> 06:27.178
I'm so sorry, but they told me to come here
to get my methadone.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.846
The methadone clinic closes at 9:00.

06:28.930 --> 06:32.224
I know, but I had to take my dog to the vet.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.186
She swallowed the squeaker
from her chew toy

06:35.270 --> 06:37.229
and by the time I got here, it was closed.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.981
Nothing personal,
but we're very strict about...

06:39.066 --> 06:41.192
No, I understand that, but...

06:41.735 --> 06:44.361
I'm gonna get sick,
and it was an emergency.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.907
Didn't I just tell you to go to admitting? Go!

06:48.492 --> 06:51.243
Guy got stabbed in the thigh.
Positive pulse below the wound.

06:51.328 --> 06:52.953
What happened, dude?
You get mugged by a midget?

06:53.205 --> 06:55.206
-I don't think that's...
-Little person.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.874
Sorry, little Nurse Jackie.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.835
You probably meant that as an insult.
Very much a compliment.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.712
He did it to himself, says it was an accident.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.547
One, two, three.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.052
It was an accident.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.430
I work at this sandwich place...

07:11.515 --> 07:13.557
Quiznos, Second Avenue, I know you.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.771
-Of course.
-Meatball sub, lightly toasted.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.649
Let's cut his pants and get an IV in.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.821
Tell me how this happens to a man.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.074
Well, you're probably not gonna...

07:31.493 --> 07:33.452
I have Tourette's.

07:34.496 --> 07:37.790
Not the yelling kind.
That would totally suck.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.042
But the really great stabbing yourself kind?

07:40.627 --> 07:43.796
No, but...
I mean, I've never stabbed myself before.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.258
Usually, I just hit myself... Not all the time.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.262
I just get tics, like around girls.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.348
-It stops what I'm feeling.
-When you're attracted to them?

07:54.432 --> 07:56.934
Well, sort of. It's more like...

07:57.018 --> 08:00.813
-More like when you're overwhelmed?
-Yeah. Yeah.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.315
I... I don't know, I can't really explain it.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.694
-No one can explain it.
-It's more prevalent than you think.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.947
You know something? I...

08:15.078 --> 08:17.788
We're gonna stitch you up
and get you out of here in no time, chief.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.793
Okay, we have...

08:22.878 --> 08:25.504
What do we have?
Fruit Roll-Ups and pretzels.

08:25.589 --> 08:28.799
Pretzels are mostly if you get carsick,
Fi. Okay?

08:28.884 --> 08:30.467
I never get carsick.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.052
Well, sometimes you do.

08:32.137 --> 08:35.139
Not this time. We're going to the country.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.892
Why are we going to the country?

08:38.310 --> 08:41.812
For an adventure.
To see what the day brings.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.107
You know these don't have much fruit
in them, don't you?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.817
As a matter of fact, yes, I did know that.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.069
I was trying to poison you.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.322
That's not funny, Mom.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.741
Come on. It's a little funny.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.577
A little.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.373
Oh, my God, I needed this.

09:02.334 --> 09:05.169
I'm sorry, honey, it took me so... Whatever.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.755
We're here and we are doing it.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.298
Exactly.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.844
Love you.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.954
Yes.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.083
Hey. Are you a doctor?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.876
Are you a patient?

09:45.961 --> 09:47.294
I'm trying.

09:47.712 --> 09:52.007
Can you tell me why the flaming Norwegian
won't give me my methadone?

09:52.550 --> 09:56.720
I'm going through withdrawals here
and nobody's helping me.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.555
Sir, I'm sorry.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.976
You're going to have to go back to
the waiting room until your name is called.

10:02.978 --> 10:04.895
I'm sorry, I...

10:04.980 --> 10:09.316
I have that much tolerance for drug addicts.

10:11.653 --> 10:16.365
Pardon me, but could either of you ladies
tell me where I might find Jackie Peyton?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.826
I have no idea.

10:20.829 --> 10:21.829
May I help you?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.791
As a matter of fact, yes.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.002
I was wondering who I would speak to

10:28.086 --> 10:31.213
if I was to donate
some money to this hospital.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.426
You see, one of your nurses saved my life
when I was having a seizure.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.344
I'd love to hear all about it.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.680
I'm Gloria. And you are?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.266
-Bill.
-It's my pleasure, Bill.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.273
"O'Geraty. Karen O'Geraty."

10:49.774 --> 10:51.859
It's Keiran. It's Irish.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.944
Aye, so it is.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.363
We're Irish, we're not pirates.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.199
Welcome to America.

11:02.746 --> 11:06.665
Well, it does look like a rash.
When did you notice this?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.127
-When we got off the plane.
-No, it was at the hotel, as I remember it.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.420
Long flight from Dublin, huh?

11:11.504 --> 11:15.466
Seven hours, not to mention
the three we spent on the tarmac.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.218
Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.306
Mr. O'Geraty got a rash
on his way back from Dublin.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.852
Yep, contact dermatitis, AKA rash.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.563
Let's get him some cortisone cream.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.815
Probably just an allergic reaction.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.069
Check it out, I'm allergic to cats.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.072
This morning,
a cat stuck its rear end in my face.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.709
-That hurt?
-Yes. It does.

11:51.002 --> 11:53.212
-What about itching? Does it itch?
-No.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.423
What about his veins?
They're worse than mine.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.134
What do you think about that?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.766
Looks like a rash, doesn't feel like a rash.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.478
Would you guys mind waiting here
just a little bit?

12:14.984 --> 12:16.944
I think he might need another look.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.695
Nah, he's good to go.
You can discharge him.

12:18.780 --> 12:22.282
I was just thinking, the rash is tender,
they just made a transatlantic flight,

12:22.367 --> 12:25.536
and he's got some pretty
grisly varicose veins.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.171
Oh, my God.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.881
In.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.175
I'm sorry to bother you, Dr. O'Hara.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.052
Then it better be worth it.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.013
Well, okay.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.559
I was wondering if you could, you know,
weigh in on something for me.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.456
Look, Mommy! I love her!

13:10.540 --> 13:14.334
Oh, my goodness.
Honey, she is so ugly, she's cute.

13:15.044 --> 13:20.174
Okay, so it's a praying mantis
frozen forever in genuine Lucite.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.426
Great. It really is great.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.428
All right. Everybody in.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.266
-They're loving this, babe.
-So am I.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.642
So am I.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.645
On to our next adventure!

13:36.816 --> 13:39.234
No. No calls. Not today.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.652
I am here.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.908
Look, please don't put me in the position
of asking you to return my call.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.702
Just get your manners together and do it.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.167
This is Dr. O'Hara.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.045
Dr. O'Hara,
this is Keiran and Molly O'Geraty.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.630
O'Hara... She's Irish.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.757
Yes, only on my father's side, I'm afraid.

14:02.050 --> 14:04.885
-Still.
-She's gonna check one more thing.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.221
No, Zoey, you should stay.

14:08.056 --> 14:10.390
It's your hunch we're following.

14:11.059 --> 14:14.853
Eddie, Eddie, I really need
like a Zyrtec or something.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.813
What's the matter,
are you allergic to yourself?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.492
Can I just say I'm loving it here today?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.160
Really, why is that?

14:30.828 --> 14:32.746
Well, number one, you're back.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.831
Number two, Jackie's gone.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.667
Yeah? Where'd she go?

14:36.960 --> 14:39.753
I don't really like to think about
what she does when she's not around.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.172
Here you go. Goodbye.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.008
You're probably wondering
what I'm having a reaction to.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.302
-Am I right?
-No, not really.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.429
It's cats, that's what.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.307
Actually, it's one particular cat.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.101
You know Sam?

14:54.978 --> 14:56.520
Sam the cat?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.105
No, male nurse.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.149
It's his girlfriend's cat.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.653
We hooked up. Not just once, either.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.030
And I fit in how?

15:08.283 --> 15:11.785
Does me fucking his girlfriend
make me a total dick?

15:13.413 --> 15:14.913
No.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.708
A lot of things qualify you to be a dick.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.044
You are firing on a lot of cylinders, Coop.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.462
A lot of cylinders.

15:26.676 --> 15:29.303
I love this guy! I missed you so much.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.226
Yeah.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.858
We had a reservation
at the Gray Flint Inn, but...

15:42.942 --> 15:45.110
They overbooked, didn't they?

15:45.194 --> 15:47.779
-Yeah.
-It's not family-owned anymore.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.573
When the senior Mr. Piper died,

15:50.074 --> 15:52.826
his adopted son sold it to a corporation.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.203
Not like it used to be.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.956
It's good news for me though.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.877
This isn't a hotel.
This is somebody's living room.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.087
It's called a bed-and-breakfast, sweetie.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.924
And this nice lady, Elaine,
shares her house with guests.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.135
And I am delighted to have you.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.804
-Such a beautiful family.
-Thank you.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.182
So, our rooms would be where?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.602
The only room is on the second floor,

16:18.686 --> 16:21.271
nice and quiet,
and filled with gorgeous antiques.

16:23.274 --> 16:26.318
Well, if that doesn't put you in the mood,
I don't know what will.

16:26.402 --> 16:30.030
Hey, who likes eggs in the nest
for breakfast?

16:35.119 --> 16:39.039
Well, this is great. This... Very cozy.

16:43.169 --> 16:47.339
Hey, two tablets of Vicodin
and some other shit.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.509
-You okay?
-Yeah. No problem.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.762
My girlfriend's just blowing off my calls.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.433
I know all about that, Sam.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.396
Whatever. You know, it's probably nothing.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.773
Except last time she did this,
there was another guy.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.777
Shit. That'll kill me.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.488
Hey, Coop.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.490
I left my pager, so...

17:13.866 --> 17:16.493
Poor Sam here
thinks his lady's stepping out on him.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.121
Really? That's...

17:19.205 --> 17:20.747
Maybe not. I don't know.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.332
-Something's up.
-Yeah.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.001
The trick is,
find out who she's hanging out with.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.878
Am I right, Coop?

17:29.757 --> 17:31.675
Sorry. Excuse me.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.344
Two Vicodin and some other shit.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.266
Hang in there, Sam.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.816
Where is the TV?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.777
B&Bs don't have TV, honey.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.824
Look, you guys.
I tried finding a different hotel.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.033
I really did.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.535
You did great, Kev.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.121
I think you guys should try thanking Daddy.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.790
Okay? Adventures toughen you up.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.710
Can we get popcorn shrimp now?

18:06.794 --> 18:09.880
How about we ask Elaine if there's
a place for popcorn shrimp nearby?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.965
Or we can just go exploring.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.263
Knock-knock.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.891
Would you like some cold cuts and sodas?

18:20.975 --> 18:22.100
The kitchen's still open.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.853
We were gonna ask you
if there's a seafood restaurant nearby.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.396
We're gonna have a family dinner.

18:26.481 --> 18:28.732
Well, there's a tavern at the end of the road.

18:29.317 --> 18:33.445
They boast about their peel-and-eat shrimp,
but I happen to know they're frozen.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.323
Well, you know, we all have our secrets.

18:38.493 --> 18:41.578
Grace, Fiona,
I have a television downstairs.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.082
You didn't see it. It's in
my Grandma Ruth's antique pie cupboard.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.169
-Please?
-Okay. But only for a bit.

19:02.058 --> 19:06.895
Hon, I know it's none of my business
so I guess that's why I'm interested,

19:09.649 --> 19:11.566
but you look a little ragged.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.446
I got some schnapps if you want it.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.659
I'm not gonna say
anything more on the subject.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.165
I like your frog collection.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.962
It's very nice.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.890
You got a girlfriend?

19:43.975 --> 19:47.102
Nah. Once they see the tic, they run.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.982
That's a shame
'cause you're obviously a nice guy.

19:55.486 --> 19:58.029
I've lost my fair share of girls, too.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.283
Thanks for the pep talk, man,

20:01.534 --> 20:04.035
but I saw your picture
on this place's brochure.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.746
You're not exactly the kind of guy
I can relate to.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.083
I have Tourette's, bro.

20:11.252 --> 20:12.836
Get out of here.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.589
I act out in inappropriate sexual touch.

20:16.591 --> 20:17.757
It's true.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.679
Believe me when I tell you
I know what it's like to lose a girl

20:22.763 --> 20:25.223
over an involuntary neurological response.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.352
-No way.
-Yes way.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.439
Nearly lost a couple of jobs
along the way, too.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.274
But you're a doctor.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.734
Yes, I am.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.653
A doctor who gets a lot of ladies.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.363
Okay.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.616
Mind over matter, my friend.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.076
You can beat this.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.455
Later, Quiznos.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.045
Okay, see here?

20:55.671 --> 20:57.213
That's a small,

20:57.924 --> 21:00.926
barely perceptible blood clot.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.136
Blood clot? Oh, my God.

21:04.055 --> 21:07.933
Yeah, you came very close to
having a pulmonary embolism,

21:08.017 --> 21:09.142
which could've killed you.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.982
But luckily, you have this young lady
to thank for catching it.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.612
I'll leave you in charge, Zoey.

21:24.492 --> 21:26.201
I'm not, like, young-young.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.079
I'm rounding the corner to the big 2-4.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.830
Thank you.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.543
All in a day's work.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.171
Genesis 3:7.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.761
-"And the..." Yeah.
-"Eyes of them both

21:44.845 --> 21:46.680
"were opened and they knew

21:46.764 --> 21:49.182
-"that they were naked."
-Naked. No.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.017
Let's not read.

21:53.312 --> 21:58.233
What do you think her story is?
She seems like an ex-nun or something.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.276
-I don't know.
-"In the beginning..."

22:00.361 --> 22:04.072
She's kind of odd.
She seems nice enough though.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.952
-She's fucking weird.
-She's so fucking weird.

22:11.831 --> 22:15.709
We'll get a good night's sleep,
have the breakfast part of our B&B,

22:15.793 --> 22:17.877
and take off in the morning.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.088
Kevin?

22:21.257 --> 22:22.882
What's up, babe?

22:23.509 --> 22:25.301
Please don't kill me.

22:25.761 --> 22:28.471
I'm just having this
there's-no-place-like-home

22:28.556 --> 22:30.181
kind of a moment.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.476
I like our bed. I like our breakfast.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.395
How fucked up is that?

22:35.479 --> 22:39.232
I drag us all the way out here
and that's all I can think about.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.651
-You want to go home?
-Is that awful?

22:41.736 --> 22:42.819
I think that's great.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.654
Really? We can go home?

22:44.739 --> 22:46.948
We can always go home.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.328
You're shivering. You cold?

22:55.332 --> 22:58.043
-A little clammy.
-That's blood sugar.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.921
How about I dump a little more
schnapps in that hot cocoa?

23:04.675 --> 23:06.426
Handsome and smart.

23:19.023 --> 23:21.191
I've been here all fucking day.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.068
Sir, do not take that tone with me.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.029
Please! I'm begging you!

23:28.240 --> 23:32.285
Do you not see this guy?
He's in full-blown withdrawal.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.536
He skipped the clinic today.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.622
-I had an emergency!
-I'm sorry.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.207
We can't encourage this.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.000
So, you treat his symptoms. Give him meth.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.377
The guy is in withdrawal.
You don't see this?

23:41.462 --> 23:43.046
Do you need to go back to nursing school?

23:43.130 --> 23:44.964
Jesus fucking Christ.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.925
Give him 20 methadone, now!

23:47.510 --> 23:49.219
Keep your voice down, Dr. Cooper.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.804
You know what the problem
with healthcare is today?

23:50.888 --> 23:53.598
Nobody cares! But I do, for the record.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.309
But you missed a pulmonary embolism.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.019
-What?
-Nothing.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.650
Drinks?

24:05.236 --> 24:06.653
You're joking.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.906
I don't joke. I need a drink, don't you?

24:12.952 --> 24:16.663
So if you're not married anymore,
how come you still wear that ring?

24:17.331 --> 24:18.915
Keep people away.

24:18.999 --> 24:23.169
Cops. Short, fat married men.

24:23.963 --> 24:28.341
They see me in a nice suit
and can't help themselves.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.343
Catnip.

24:32.429 --> 24:33.638
"Catnip"?

24:36.809 --> 24:38.935
My whole life! Many years.

24:42.273 --> 24:44.691
That's so great.

24:45.693 --> 24:49.154
Thank you, guys,
for being so good about leaving early.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.408
Sometimes the perfect vacation
is just being with your family,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.702
even if it's in your own house.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.163
We have a better TV, anyways.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.543
Hey, I can't see in the dark.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.753
How are we supposed
to play the alphabet game

25:05.838 --> 25:07.422
if we can't see anything?

25:07.506 --> 25:11.509
Well, if it's dark outside,
you have to find things inside the car.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.095
Let's see. What letter were we on?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.055
"H" was for "Honda."

25:16.640 --> 25:18.641
"I" was for "interstate."

25:18.893 --> 25:20.602
"J." We're on "J."

25:23.564 --> 25:28.401
"J" is for "Jackie's phone,"
which is not a toy.

25:28.903 --> 25:30.445
Can we call Dr. O'Hara?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.488
She called us three times!

25:32.573 --> 25:34.490
Sweetie, no. No work.

25:34.575 --> 25:37.577
No school today.
That's the whole thing about playing hooky.

25:37.912 --> 25:40.955
Baby, if you need to call her back,
call her back.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.291
Sit back, Fi. Put your seat belt on.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.834
Whatever it is, sweetie, it can wait.

25:44.919 --> 25:47.503
There's nothing more important
than just being here.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.634
No, wait. This is Jackie.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.260
It's ringing.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.471
God damn it, Fiona! Give me that phone!

25:56.555 --> 25:58.890
-Hello?
-Hello, Fiona darling.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.808
She's at a bar.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.644
Have you seen your new school?

26:02.811 --> 26:05.438
-I'm not playing.
-My new what? My new what?

26:05.648 --> 26:08.274
Have you seen your new school?

26:08.359 --> 26:10.193
She wants to know
if I've seen my new school.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.362
-God damn it.
-Do I have a new school?

26:12.446 --> 26:15.114
Sweetie, give me that phone!
I'm not playing!

26:15.532 --> 26:16.574
What's she talking about, Jackie?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.785
I have no idea. She's at a bar.
She's shitfaced.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.120
Fiona, give me that phone right now!

26:21.413 --> 26:22.622
Jackie?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.541
Hi, listen, honey, this is not a good time.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.961
We will talk tomorrow. Okay, bye.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.547
-What did I do?
-What did she do?

26:31.966 --> 26:34.050
It's okay, Fi. You didn't do anything.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.686
Tell me you didn't take her money.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.982
I begged you.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.652
I made you look me in the eye.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.363
Please tell me
you didn't take her fucking money.

26:57.741 --> 26:59.158
You took it.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.706
Kevin, please don't do this.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.291
-Seriously, Kevin.
-Dad!

27:06.375 --> 27:07.834
-Kevin, don't do this!
-Where are you going?

27:07.918 --> 27:09.419
Kevin, please!

27:13.340 --> 27:16.884
I'm sorry, guys. Don't worry.
He's just playing a game.

27:19.638 --> 27:22.140
Doesn't he have to be
inside the car to play?

27:28.897 --> 27:31.357
No, this one has different rules.
