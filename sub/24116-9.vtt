A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:28.695 --> 00:30.363
You still want to go outside?

00:31.740 --> 00:32.949
Eh?

00:33.742 --> 00:35.326
There's no way back from that.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.955
Who convinced you?

00:39.998 --> 00:41.124
Eh?

00:42.333 --> 00:43.626
It wasn't your brother.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.087
It was her.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.089
She did it.

00:49.090 --> 00:52.761
With that ass,
she would have convinced me too.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.638
[tires screech outside]

00:55.722 --> 00:57.432
[police sirens]

00:57.515 --> 00:58.892
You stay here.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.727
[loud explosion]

01:23.416 --> 01:26.336
-[officer 1]  Go, go, go!
-[officer 2]  Come on! Hurry!

01:30.089 --> 01:33.051
-[officer 1]  Come on, come on!
-[officer 2]  Out! Move, move, move!

01:34.302 --> 01:35.345
[gun shots]

01:35.845 --> 01:37.096
[officer 3]  Go, go, go!

01:39.641 --> 01:42.894
[gun shots]

01:46.689 --> 01:49.734
[gun shots]

02:00.328 --> 02:03.790
[police sirens]

02:17.428 --> 02:19.848
You have to tell the truth,
you didn't do anything.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.766
-[Manito] Traitor.
-[Teo] I'll get you out.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.934
[DA Ramos] Hey.

02:23.017 --> 02:25.395
-You shouldn't be here.
-Why are they taking him?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.397
It's for his own sake. It's procedure.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.774
They almost killed him,
they treat him like a criminal.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.402
Your brother's fine.
If I hadn't come, Lorenzo would have.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.864
-I'm protecting him.
-You have to protect him like a witness.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.992
-I shouldn't be here talking to you.
-Don't fuck with me.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.619
And don't fuck with my brother.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.462
[DA Ramos] I would like many things.

02:52.922 --> 02:55.425
You hardly can help me quit smoking,
for instance.

02:56.426 --> 03:00.555
But there's one thing you can do
to help me, and yourself too.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.934
Tell me what I want to hear.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.563
Who started the fire?

03:15.528 --> 03:18.156
It seems you're playing dumb,
but you're not guilty.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.201
It looks like you chose to play dumb.

03:23.119 --> 03:26.372
But you can be dumb and free. Understand?

03:27.582 --> 03:28.708
Free.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.547
Think about what you're going to say.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.718
Did you see Aníbal that night
in the factory?

03:46.601 --> 03:47.602
What was he doing?

03:48.561 --> 03:50.021
He brought the fabrics in.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.318
-That's not good eno--
-He got his hands on the switchboard.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.071
But I didn't see what he did.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.160
But you saw him there?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.872
Yes.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.708
I saw him.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.629
That's all. The phases are all balanced.

04:14.712 --> 04:17.757
I put in a 380 switchboard. All top class.

04:28.017 --> 04:32.188
[Marita] What's happening?
Why are you taking him? Aníbal, stay here!

04:36.401 --> 04:39.570
Someone talk to me!
Where are you taking him?

04:39.654 --> 04:43.366
My son is not a murderer!
My son didn't do anything! Aníbal! Aníbal!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.618
[car accelerates]

05:12.979 --> 05:15.857
-Are you alone?
-Yes, what is it?

05:17.191 --> 05:20.987
I want to talk to you, but...
for real this time.

05:23.656 --> 05:27.243
The night your mother died,
you shouldn't have been in this house.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.205
-You were at a friend's.
-Right.

05:31.581 --> 05:32.582
You came back.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.086
[Edha]  Yes, I came back,
I forgot a handbook.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.672
A notebook.
My friend's father gave me a ride.

06:09.368 --> 06:12.080
[heavy breathing]

06:16.209 --> 06:19.921
[heavy breathing]

06:30.389 --> 06:34.143
I had stayed, working late.
Ironing some shirts.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.063
Your dad was very strict with that,
especially with the cuffs.

06:37.438 --> 06:38.815
[Marita]  That's when I saw you.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.401
You were running, horrified.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.239
[young Edha gasps]

06:51.035 --> 06:53.162
You lied, you told me you weren't there.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.540
-Yes, I lied to you.
-Why?

06:55.957 --> 06:58.876
To protect Lorenzo, and to protect you.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.216
I approached the door...

07:07.176 --> 07:09.887
I never imagined what I would find.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.639
The three of them were there...

07:11.889 --> 07:14.934
your mother, Odette, and Lorenzo.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.526
At first, I was puzzled
by Inés's expression because...

07:24.402 --> 07:26.654
she seemed to be enjoying it and...

07:27.238 --> 07:30.491
Lorenzo and Odette
were getting more and more turned on.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.244
[panting]

07:33.327 --> 07:36.122
At one point,
Inés's expression started to change.

07:36.497 --> 07:40.293
Lorenzo was squeezing her throat, hard,
and Odette kissed her.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.058
They didn't speak to me.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.561
It wasn't necessary, everything was clear.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.355
They agreed on the suicide.

08:02.273 --> 08:04.984
Lorenzo covered his back
and Odette helped him.

08:05.485 --> 08:09.739
Actually, she supported the idea of your
father's trip, especially in front of you.

08:10.364 --> 08:15.912
I told them you were back, Odette
went to your room and you were asleep.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.209
[door closes]

08:23.211 --> 08:26.255
[Edha]  I wasn't asleep. I was very scared.

08:42.271 --> 08:44.857
[Marita]  Then Odette dressed her
with a gown,

08:45.650 --> 08:50.363
and Lorenzo, desperate, placed pills
and cocaine next to the body.

08:51.864 --> 08:55.493
He asked me to pack a suitcase
to fake the trip.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.423
[Marita]  I wanted a family.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.760
And Lorenzo, in his way...

09:13.553 --> 09:16.389
and in exchange for my silence,
gave it to me.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.436
[Odette] Hello.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.480
I was his true alibi.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.275
And my son, of course.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.364
Sometimes, in our desperation
to feel loved, we can do anything.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.909
He killed her.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.787
Everyone lied to me.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.248
The whole time.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.293
Yes, but now we'll tell the truth.

09:46.127 --> 09:49.380
I don't care about the consequences.
They're coming for my son.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.091
He's the only thing I have.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.094
The only good thing in my life.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.889
Aníbal is innocent, he's no criminal.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.766
He didn't set fire to any factory.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.977
He's in prison, unfairly.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.690
If he'd wanted to hurt you,
he would've done a long time ago.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.734
He was seen, there are witnesses.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.279
I also witnessed a crime,
and look where the people responsible are.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.701
Your mother's death shows
how the truth can be twisted.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.703
I can't think anymore.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.164
Think with your heart.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.834
After all, Aníbal is your brother.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.131
I need your help, please.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.889
You can come in.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.349
Teo...

10:42.350 --> 10:43.351
Teo!

10:59.075 --> 11:00.910
[cell door opens]

11:22.807 --> 11:26.352
I tried to help you, brother.
Here you need a deal to get anything.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.566
Ollanta was about to sell you out.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.443
And you?

11:36.695 --> 11:37.738
What about me?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.574
Where do I fit in your plans?

11:41.075 --> 11:42.701
I thought you were dead...

11:43.327 --> 11:46.038
and you were playing hide and seek
with that bastard.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.873
It's not my fault.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.669
You played your own game, as always.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.338
You didn't want to work at the factory.

11:54.797 --> 11:57.883
You fucked me over to get Celia.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.718
The thing with Celia was real.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.722
It wasn't a delusion like it was with you.
And it's over.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.519
We both did what we could
after your death.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.732
Now you're alive.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.449
Celia and I will get you
out of here, Manito.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.578
Don't you see I've already testified
against Aníbal? And nothing happened.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.706
And I'm still in jail.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.374
Where's my new life?

12:31.208 --> 12:33.043
They're all the fucking same.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.088
Even you believed their bullshit.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.343
Guard!

12:43.721 --> 12:45.556
There's someone here who's leaving.

12:45.639 --> 12:46.932
[cell door opens]

12:47.391 --> 12:48.434
Get out.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.271
OK.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.444
[Manito] I'd rather rot here in jail...

12:59.778 --> 13:01.947
than ever see you again.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.118
Go shake your ass with the rich people.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.955
Leave me alone.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.333
Leave me in peace.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.794
I'll get you out of here.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.265
He's not well.

13:29.266 --> 13:33.812
-Let's go. We have nothing to do here.
-You don't. I do.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.025
Look, I came with you.
There's many people waiting for me.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.529
-I wish you luck.
-You're leaving already?

13:42.488 --> 13:45.699
If he's innocent,
Pereyra Ramos will get him out.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.294
My brother's going to prison,
we don't know if he did it.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.923
-If he's innocent, he'll get out.
-The foreman will testify against him.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.384
That drunk hasn't got the authority
to blame anyone.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.345
If anyone had any responsibility
over that factory, it was him.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.058
Thank you.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.021
And sorry.
So many years trusting Lorenzo...

14:16.105 --> 14:19.441
It's fine. You trust who you love.
He's your dad.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.860
I trust you.

14:23.612 --> 14:26.615
-I want to apologize for all I said.
-We're here.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.577
Yes.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.747
Antonio, I want a change.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.876
We have to move towards Milan.
You can't stop now.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.253
Milan is far.
I can't even think about that now.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.421
I can.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.798
That's why I'm here.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.307
You don't care that your son is in jail.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.144
You don't know what I'm doing
to get him out.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.564
The only thing you care about
is you, you, you. Nothing else.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.857
[Lorenzo sighs]

15:41.941 --> 15:44.151
I know things, Lorenzo. Don't forget that.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.196
Stop threatening me
with something so delicate.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.658
Your wife's death
is a delicate issue, isn't it?

15:51.033 --> 15:54.453
-Shut up, you're fucking deranged.
-Yeah, I may be deranged...

15:55.162 --> 15:58.415
but I want your son free.
Aníbal is not a criminal.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.500
[Lorenzo sighs]

15:59.583 --> 16:01.043
Get him out, or I'll ruin you.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.171
You're such a bad person.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.467
You're ungrateful.
I should have realized a long time ago.

16:09.051 --> 16:13.222
I'm tired. I'm tired of the lies,
I'm tired of the humiliation.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.308
Are you feeling so humiliated now?

16:17.768 --> 16:19.853
Do you remember what you did for work?

16:20.562 --> 16:21.814
Where you lived?

16:22.523 --> 16:23.691
I gave you everything.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.987
-Even a son.
-No. You gave me an alibi.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.864
For you, so you didn't go to prison
for Inés's murder.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.994
Don't threaten me. I'm not scared of you.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.914
Either do something for your son...

16:39.331 --> 16:41.417
or your life becomes a living hell.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.377
I swear.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.144
My brother's still in jail.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.814
What are you talking about?

17:04.732 --> 17:05.858
The factory.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.736
My brother's in jail, it wasn't him.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.489
-Florencia, would you leave us, please?
-Yes.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.202
And who did it, according to you?

17:17.286 --> 17:20.622
Your brother was responsible, the foreman.
And he hid after the fire.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.875
-Why did he run if he's innocent?
-You know.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.418
I don't! Tell me.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.880
No one believes a colored immigrant,
least of all if he's poor.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.841
We're guilty before we're born.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.385
You don't seduce me with your self-pity.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.428
No?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.390
What did you hire me for?
To sell this shit? Sell misery?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.184
You're not the only one suffering.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.564
Aníbal is my brother
and he's as real as yours.

17:45.647 --> 17:47.357
There's no evidence against him.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.277
-Manito saw him.
-Your brother is a wimp.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.864
He faked his death,
he was responsible for that factory.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.326
-You never doubted him?
-Don't talk about my brother like that!

17:57.409 --> 17:59.411
Are you going to hit me?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.289
You never doubted him?

18:02.748 --> 18:03.832
Aníbal did it.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.335
It's easy to throw blame around.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.424
We have no idea what the truth is.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.179
I don't trust anyone anymore.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.140
Antonio will tell you
how to finish the fitting.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.694
Good afternoon.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.159
[machine beeps]

18:40.661 --> 18:41.912
[machine beeps]

18:42.663 --> 18:43.914
[mutters]

18:44.706 --> 18:46.458
-Look, it's not work--
-Yes?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.127
Can you give me another?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.545
Perfect.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.298
Yes, I'll pass the message along.
Thank you.

18:53.382 --> 18:56.760
-Look, it's not working. Give me another.
-No, it's not the card.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.387
I'll have to keep it.

18:58.470 --> 19:02.933
The Director asked you to call him,
to arrange a meeting for next week.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.020
Next week?
I have patients waiting for me right now.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.940
They were assigned
to another professional.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.484
You've been suspended.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.971
[tires screech]

19:46.351 --> 19:48.187
Elena, get in the car, please.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.279
Hi! What's up? How are you?

19:57.738 --> 19:59.114
We never spoke, you and me.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.242
I thought this would be
an excellent opportunity.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.038
I want to congratulate you
for having such a good reputation.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.915
From your female students, right?

20:07.998 --> 20:09.708
And it's exponential,

20:09.791 --> 20:12.836
the younger they are,
the more they admire you.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.757
They say great things, they love you
so much, they put you on a pedestal.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.176
Not all of them,
there's always an exception.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.428
Not everyone says good things,
all the time.

20:21.511 --> 20:25.098
I don't know what they told you,
but it's a lie. I--

20:25.182 --> 20:30.270
What I don't know is what you're doing
with my daughter, you piece of shit.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.986
[car door opens and closes]

21:00.759 --> 21:03.387
Girls, the big day's here,
the fashion show.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.765
Please, please, you have to do it right.

21:06.848 --> 21:11.561
The weight shift. OK? I'll show you
one more time. Pay attention.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.357
We're walking. When we get to the end,
that's when you shift your weight.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.276
Let your ass be seen.

21:17.359 --> 21:21.446
Let yourself be seen, gorgeous.
That's what a model does. My God...

21:21.905 --> 21:23.991
Do you know how to shift your weight?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.201
Don't fuck with me, Yastin.
This is stupid.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.788
Paloma will save us. Italy, baby. Italy.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.835
-You're still worried about Teo, right?
-It's Manito I'm worried about.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.086
That loser?

21:40.841 --> 21:43.427
-Who are they?
-Capitalists.

21:43.510 --> 21:47.264
People with money. We can't depend
on that rich bitch Paloma.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.391
We have to expand our business.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.813
[Yastin] How are you, bro?

21:55.439 --> 21:56.481
Good?

21:57.357 --> 21:58.191
[Yastin]  Shall we?

22:01.528 --> 22:02.738
[Teo] I saw my brother.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.906
I'm glad your brother is alive.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.077
He said you were
in the factory that night.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.370
Yes.

22:11.413 --> 22:13.081
What happened that night?

22:13.957 --> 22:16.585
Why don't you ask your brother?
He was the foreman.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.838
I want your version.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.050
Your brother was so drunk that night...

22:23.592 --> 22:27.095
he was a danger, to himself and others.
I sent him home.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.681
He wouldn't leave. He didn't listen.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.768
I dropped everything and left.
That's my version.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.647
-So, it was an accident?
-No.

22:37.939 --> 22:40.484
That place was a time bomb,
it ended up accordingly.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.737
And Ronnie?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.741
-What about Ronnie?
-Ronnie worked for Edha, right?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.077
And it didn't end well.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.622
Teo, I'll give you some advice.
Milan is so close...

22:54.664 --> 22:57.042
you have to decide if you're in or out.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.587
You can't be in two places at once.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.880
[cloth rips]

23:02.631 --> 23:04.591
You're in the past or in the future.

23:04.674 --> 23:07.094
You look forward or back.

23:08.386 --> 23:09.721
Because if you look back...

23:10.931 --> 23:14.017
you disappear.
Like the ashes from the factory.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.270
Hmm? It's your call.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.862
[Ronnie]  They screwed him over.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.491
He went to the sweatshop once.
Lorenzo forced him to go.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.576
They screw everyone.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.704
Me too. They fired me.
I took them to court, won...

23:35.455 --> 23:38.875
but Lorenzo found a way
to make me return every dime.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.927
[Ronnie]  Why are you here?

23:51.680 --> 23:53.890
-I wanted to see you.
-What is it?

23:54.933 --> 23:57.936
Edha and Antonio.
I think they want to fuck us over.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.271
With what?

24:01.022 --> 24:03.150
You don't trust them. I don't either.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.736
-I do trust Antonio.
-I'm not just talking about him.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.698
The people who want to screw you.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.616
Let's talk someplace else. Come on.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.417
[Ronnie] Come in.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.146
Can I get you a drink?

24:44.232 --> 24:45.984
Antonio is covering for you.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.453
I know it was you.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.247
You set the factory on fire.

24:59.831 --> 25:00.874
What are you saying?

25:01.333 --> 25:04.461
You hate Lorenzo and Edha
because they fired you. They used you.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.254
Like they use everybody.

25:07.714 --> 25:11.259
If you don't talk, my brother rots
in prison... because of you.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.054
I know you did it.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.557
[Edha]  Inés never abandoned me.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.477
Now I know. She was killed.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.563
I feel a new, different kind of pain

25:23.647 --> 25:27.525
that doesn't paralyze me.
A pain that urges me forward.

25:55.553 --> 25:59.140
[gasping]

26:03.061 --> 26:06.231
[gasping]

26:47.689 --> 26:49.899
[breathes heavily]

26:50.900 --> 26:52.235
[Lorenzo sighs]

26:52.902 --> 26:54.279
You were too young.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.365
There was nothing to explain.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.871
One thing is not explaining...

27:06.041 --> 27:09.210
and another is lying and hiding
the fact that you killed her.

27:09.294 --> 27:13.298
No, I didn't kill Inés.
I'd be in prison for that.

27:13.381 --> 27:15.050
[she scoffs]

27:16.926 --> 27:21.014
Sometimes...
you look for the right time to tell...

27:22.974 --> 27:27.020
then time passes
and that moment never comes.

27:28.605 --> 27:33.318
When it does come, you ask yourself
if telling is still worth it.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.113
I had to choose, darling.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.950
The truth...or happiness.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.162
Your happiness.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.832
Am I a criminal for that?

27:51.336 --> 27:52.921
Reliving the past...

27:55.173 --> 27:58.134
is going to hurt you much more than me.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.846
-So I don't advise it.
-What is your advice?

28:04.057 --> 28:06.810
-To keep living this lie?
-No.

28:07.685 --> 28:09.437
To pretend nothing happened?

28:09.521 --> 28:10.772
[Lorenzo sighs]

28:10.855 --> 28:12.899
But we can start over.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.235
We've done it countless times!

28:16.861 --> 28:20.031
We went through many hardships together.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.826
Nothing we went through
compares with this.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.829
Don't even try it.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.091
You're not taking models,
you're taking mules.

28:38.508 --> 28:41.594
This is design. You never saw
anything as elaborated as this.

28:41.678 --> 28:44.097
Don't try to lower my price
by calling me "mule."

28:44.180 --> 28:45.974
That's from a cheap, third-rate magazine.

28:47.308 --> 28:50.437
You know if one splits inside you,
you're a goner?

28:50.520 --> 28:53.064
The coke gets in the blood and kills you.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.567
They don't rupture. Fuck off.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.319
"Technology." You ever hear about that?

28:58.862 --> 29:01.698
You're sick if you think
I'll swallow one of these.

29:03.032 --> 29:04.826
Not you, Celia. You're my partner.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.871
These brown chicks will carry them.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.540
Wash those big ears and listen. It's easy.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.001
They drink a glass of water.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.670
[Yastin] It's all they have to do.
The next day...

29:15.962 --> 29:18.506
if I'm lucky,
because these have slow bowels...

29:18.590 --> 29:20.467
they give daddy his stuff back.

29:21.676 --> 29:23.928
-Beautiful!
-Sophisticated.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.474
Not like those niggers
selling "oxi" in the corners like owls.

29:27.557 --> 29:31.102
No, love. My thing is "design."
I'm not made for that.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.606
[Julián sighs]

29:36.149 --> 29:37.275
Thank you.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.697
Feeling better?

29:43.656 --> 29:44.991
[Julián sighs]

29:45.074 --> 29:46.075
A little.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.790
It was a kiss, nothing else.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.627
She acted suggestively
and I made a mistake,

29:55.710 --> 29:57.295
I swear that's all that happened.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.172
That's not what Elena said.

29:59.798 --> 30:04.302
Elena is 16. What do you want
a 16-year-old to say?

30:04.385 --> 30:05.345
Eh?

30:07.388 --> 30:09.724
I would be incapable of doing that.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.559
Incapable.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.604
[sniffs]

30:14.896 --> 30:17.232
You should've talked to me
before going to Edha,

30:17.315 --> 30:19.275
I would've explained what happened.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.780
-What's he doing here?
-I had an accident, I'm fine.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.032
Your father was beaten and threatened.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.369
He came to speak with me,
please go to your room.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.537
You'll listen to him?

30:32.247 --> 30:33.540
I just did.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.459
He's in a very delicate situation.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.462
In fact, we all are. You included.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.174
I'll tell you what will happen.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.010
You'll lie to each other for 10 years.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.889
And when you're celebrating the
golden wedding, or platinum, or whatever,

30:50.265 --> 30:51.808
he'll keep lying to you, Mom.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.644
You'll play dumb,
because that's what you are.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.356
You're right.

31:00.233 --> 31:03.069
I am dumb. But you two are my family.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.821
No, no longer a family.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.908
You're insane.
You're not going to screw up my life.

31:10.493 --> 31:13.246
[footsteps move away]

31:16.249 --> 31:18.293
Forget it. Let's get the fuck away.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.545
We'll disappear for a few days, deluxe.

31:21.087 --> 31:22.714
I love you. Where?

31:23.673 --> 31:26.342
To paradise.
I made all the arrangements already.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.638
-Tell Elena.
-Elena's here with me.

31:31.723 --> 31:34.559
-She wasn't feeling well.
-OK, I'm on my way.

31:36.477 --> 31:40.064
[rock music]

32:04.589 --> 32:08.134
[rock music]  If they want, they can fly

32:09.010 --> 32:12.180
Because when they track them

32:13.514 --> 32:15.850
They disappear!

32:18.853 --> 32:22.023
If they want, they can fly

32:25.985 --> 32:28.529
They respect gravity

32:29.948 --> 32:32.742
But not entirely

32:34.619 --> 32:37.080
They disappear!

32:38.665 --> 32:39.666
[laughter]

32:39.749 --> 32:43.169
If they want, they can fly

32:43.252 --> 32:45.213
[Sebastián] Woo-hoo!

32:55.473 --> 33:02.230
Of the imaginary galaxy

33:02.981 --> 33:09.404
You, everything will be even better

33:12.240 --> 33:13.866
[Sebastián shouts]

33:20.081 --> 33:24.377
They can't find you

33:24.460 --> 33:28.381
Shadows, miles

33:28.464 --> 33:31.467
To the south

33:32.719 --> 33:36.431
Millenary...

33:39.475 --> 33:42.603
If they want, they can fly

33:43.855 --> 33:46.858
Because when they track them

33:48.234 --> 33:51.195
They disappear!

33:51.904 --> 33:53.489
[panting]

33:53.573 --> 33:57.869
No doubt, they can fly!

34:00.455 --> 34:03.291
- [Edha]  What is it?
-[Jáuregui] Elena should've been here.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.377
-I thought she was with you.
-I thought you were with her.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.671
This is how you take care of
your daughter?

34:08.755 --> 34:11.507
I called 20 times.
She didn't go to school.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.759
Where is she?

34:17.638 --> 34:22.060
[motorboat passes by outside]

34:39.327 --> 34:40.411
Ele...

34:42.955 --> 34:44.040
Elena...

34:46.918 --> 34:48.711
Wake up, we have to go.

34:50.546 --> 34:51.923
Elena.

34:52.006 --> 34:53.341
Elena, get up.

34:55.468 --> 34:56.761
Come on, wake up.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.763
Sebi!

[groans]

34:59.931 --> 35:01.849
-Sebi, get up. Elena!
-What?

35:01.933 --> 35:03.351
-Come on.
-What's the time?

35:03.434 --> 35:04.811
Sebi, she's not waking up!

35:05.311 --> 35:07.146
Elena, wake up, please!

35:10.858 --> 35:13.569
-If something happens, I'll kill you.
-Nothing will happen. We'll--

35:13.653 --> 35:14.862
I will save her.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.448
We're the problem. We're hurting her.

Tell me what happened.
