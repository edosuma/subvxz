so we ain't got to wait?

09:29.625 --> 09:31.375
J.T., I told you. Ain't no more hookups.

09:31.750 --> 09:32.666
Come on, Uncle Louis!

09:32.750 --> 09:35.250
Why are you doing me like that?
You used to give me baths.

09:36.000 --> 09:36.833
Don't trip.

10:09.541 --> 10:11.958
-I need about two cords of hickory.
-Okay.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.791
I need some more of that cherry wood
I got last week.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.250
-I like the way them ribs turned out.
-Very good.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.416
Now, I've got some alder wood for sale
that I think--

10:19.500 --> 10:22.666
You must think I'm stupid.
Can't nobody cook with that delicate shit.

-Hopefully one day it'll take.
-[laughs]

10:30.625 --> 10:33.750
[Louis] Tomorrow, I want you to come
and meet our new meat distributor.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.166
[Elijah] Uh... I can't.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.625
-[stammers] Well, why not?
-Um...

10:39.541 --> 10:42.541
I've just, uh... got to prep
some wine club shipments.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.833
How come every time
I try to teach you the business,

10:44.916 --> 10:46.500
you've got an excuse why you can't do it?

10:47.125 --> 10:49.833
Last month, I needed you to go with me
to see about a new smoker.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.583
You had some other wine thing.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.833
You know how hard your grandfather worked

10:53.916 --> 10:55.458
to keep this restaurant in the family.

10:55.541 --> 10:57.375
-Yes, sir.
-You know what this restaurant means

10:57.458 --> 10:58.375
-to the community.
-Yes.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.208
This place is historic.
Frankie Beverly had a stroke there.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.125
Mm-hmm.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.250
You're gonna take over the stand one day.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.708
You need to know how to run it.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.333
That's not it.
I just can't do it tomorrow. Sorry.

11:10.875 --> 11:11.708
Okay.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.166

Oh, um...

16:05.541 --> 16:07.708

I had to do something.

Something more important than your job?

16:11.750 --> 16:12.583
Uh...

about becoming a sommelier.

-Sommelier.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.541
That's horrible. Is she okay?

16:26.625 --> 16:29.541
I don't know. I don't be
up in people's business like that.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.583
Then why bring it up?
That don't make no sense.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.250
Now go on. What's... What's the thing?

16:47.333 --> 16:50.791
Uh, a sommelier is someone
who's an expert in wine,

16:50.875 --> 16:51.916
like Raylan at my job.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.416
He's a sommelier, but he buys wine.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.708
At a restaurant, they help you decide
which wine to drink.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.541
So they're getting paid
to tell people what to drink?

17:00.166 --> 17:02.625
I could do that.
Hennessy White goes with everything.

17:02.708 --> 17:03.833
Nope. Anyway,

17:03.916 --> 17:06.625
uh, Raylan says he's gonna write me
a letter of recommendation.

17:06.708 --> 17:07.541
[Louis] I just hope,

17:07.625 --> 17:10.666
if Raylan puts himself out there
like that, you follow through.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.083
What does that mean?

17:12.750 --> 17:13.583
I mean,

17:13.666 --> 17:16.166
you get an idea about something,
but when it comes time to do it--

17:16.250 --> 17:18.125
-Louis.
-I'm just saying what everybody knows--

17:18.208 --> 17:19.083
Louis!

17:22.375 --> 17:25.583
But, hey, if you want to tell people
what to drink with their chitlins,

17:25.666 --> 17:27.083
[stammers] I'm fine with it.

17:36.125 --> 17:39.166
[Louis] Baby, there's wig hair
on the counter and in my sink.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.541
Can we get rid of the wigs?

17:40.625 --> 17:42.375
Uh-uh. They're too expensive.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.375
Baby, you've been in remission
for two years.

17:44.458 --> 17:45.500
You don't even need 'em.

17:45.583 --> 17:46.625
I do.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.458
Louis, my hair is still too thin,

17:48.541 --> 17:52.125
and when I wear that blonde one,
I look just like Beyoncé, so no.

17:52.666 --> 17:54.166
Yeah, you do look like Beyoncé.

17:55.916 --> 17:57.208
-What'd I do now?
-You don't know?

17:57.291 --> 17:58.291
-I don't.
-You don't know?

17:58.375 --> 17:59.500
Girl, I ain't doing this.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.041
You embarrassed Elijah
at the dinner tonight.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.458
-Okay? [stammers]
-[sighs]

18:03.541 --> 18:05.333
He was all excited
about his little wine thing

18:05.416 --> 18:07.041
and then you went and shit all on it.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.041
[Louis sighs]

18:08.333 --> 18:11.333
Louis, you've got to support him
in the stuff he wants to do.

18:11.416 --> 18:12.416
I do support him.

18:12.500 --> 18:16.708
I support him learning the business
and not doing six million other things.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.250
Well, that's what kids his age do.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.458
They're trying to figure out
what they're good at.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.166
At some point, he's gonna have to man up.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.041
[Louis] Five years ago,
he was gonna be a DJ.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.208
Then he was gonna teach English in Japan.

18:28.291 --> 18:30.375
The boy don't even eat Panda Express.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.750
That's Chinese.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.708
-Don't.
-I'm just saying.

18:33.791 --> 18:36.250
We both know how this wine thing
is gonna end up.

18:36.333 --> 18:39.166
Louis, you ain't even stopped
to ask the boy

18:39.250 --> 18:40.916
why he wants to do the sommely thing.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.875
I mean, you've got to give him a chance
to figure it out.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.416
What am I gonna do in the meantime?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.041
Just wait? I'm not getting any younger.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.833
If he don't take over the stand,
who's gonna carry it on when I'm gone?

18:51.916 --> 18:54.416
-[sighs heavily]
-My father started the thing...

18:54.666 --> 18:56.583
he gave it to me, and I'm supposed to--

18:56.666 --> 18:57.666
[both] Give it to Elijah.

18:57.750 --> 18:58.875
I know.

18:58.958 --> 18:59.791
That's right.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.000
[Sylvia sighs]

19:01.500 --> 19:02.333
[clicks off light]

19:04.083 --> 19:04.916
[sheets rustle]

19:05.000 --> 19:07.416
[Sylvia] I know you ain't trying
to get nothing started

19:07.500 --> 19:09.625
-after you talked about my wigs.
-[exhales]

19:09.708 --> 19:11.291
-[Louis] Baby--
-Back up.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.791
[Sylvia] Uh-uh!
You ain't getting that either!

to another wine store already?

20:19.791 --> 20:20.916
You cheating on me already?

20:21.000 --> 20:21.833
I mean...

20:22.333 --> 20:23.166
[Elijah chuckles]

20:23.250 --> 20:24.583
So wine's, like, your thing?

20:25.708 --> 20:26.583
Yeah, kind of.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.000
Since when?

20:28.250 --> 20:29.750
Mm... Like four or five years ago.

20:30.583 --> 20:33.541
I was, uh...
I was at this restaurant with my ex--

20:33.625 --> 20:35.875
Oh, hold up. No, no, no.
There was somebody before me?

20:36.541 --> 20:38.083
Ooh. Was she ugly?

20:39.041 --> 20:40.208
Why has she got to be ugly?

20:40.291 --> 20:43.125
I don't know. You picked her.
You're clearly upgrading.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.166
-Okay, anyway... Um. [laughs]
-[laughs]

20:47.458 --> 20:48.416
Yeah, I was about to buy

20:48.500 --> 20:51.750
this cheap bottle of wine
and the waiter was like, "Nah, try this."

20:52.291 --> 20:54.250
And so he goes on and on about this wine,

20:54.333 --> 20:56.375
he's talking about stuff
I never thought about before,

20:56.458 --> 21:00.125
like, you know, how it's grown,
where the grapes are from, all this stuff.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.208
And so when I get home,

21:01.291 --> 21:04.083
I start researching everything I can
about this wine I like.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.625
Then it led to the next wine,
and the next wine, and the next wine.

21:09.916 --> 21:10.916
Yeah, I don't know.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.791
Like, growing up...

21:17.125 --> 21:19.625
we didn't have money to go nowhere, so...

21:20.791 --> 21:23.416
when I get a wine from some place
like France, some place like Spain,

21:23.500 --> 21:24.791
I just feel like I'm kinda there.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.416
You know what? You ain't right.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.041
What?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.750
To tell me a great story like that
on the first date?

21:35.458 --> 21:37.625
Now I got to go on another one.
And another one.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.250
Yeah, that's okay.

21:39.333 --> 21:41.958
-You sprung. It's alright. Could be worse.
-Whatever.

21:43.916 --> 21:45.958
So since you're so into wine,
you ever want to do more

21:46.041 --> 21:47.250
than just work in the store?

21:49.583 --> 21:50.458
Um...

21:51.125 --> 21:52.500
Yeah, yeah, I'm, um...

21:53.291 --> 21:56.333
[clicks tongue] thinking about...
think about becoming a sommelier.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.375
But, um...

21:58.125 --> 22:00.375
I don't know.
The Master exam is pretty hard, so...

22:00.916 --> 22:01.916
So? You're smart.

22:02.916 --> 22:05.291
And the fact that I'm still here
means you can keep up.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.416
Okay. Yeah. [chuckles]

22:07.625 --> 22:10.916
But in the whole, entire world,
there's only, like, 230 Master Somms.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.625
So why can't you be 231?

22:13.250 --> 22:15.000
Uh... I don't know.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.333
It's just, between work
and then studying for an exam,

22:17.416 --> 22:18.708
I just think it'll be a lot.

22:19.333 --> 22:22.291
If you work on passing the test as much
as you do coming up with excuses,

22:22.375 --> 22:23.708
it won't be hard. [chuckles]

22:27.583 --> 22:28.458
I'm sorry.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.250
That's not my place to say.

22:30.333 --> 22:32.375
-[stammers] I don't know you like that.
-It's alright.

22:32.458 --> 22:33.583
It's all good. It's all good.

22:34.625 --> 22:35.458
I mean...

22:37.291 --> 22:38.208
there's always gonna be

22:38.291 --> 22:40.291
a reason we shouldn't do something, but...

22:41.625 --> 22:42.708
if you want it...

22:47.041 --> 22:50.916
This is the entrance exam
to the Master Sommelier program.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.041
There's theory and tasting

22:53.125 --> 22:56.375
and you'll need to score an 80% to pass.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.375
Good luck.

what would you say I am?

a good neck or something.

It's the same day, every April 15th.

25:53.291 --> 25:56.083

that Papa did...

25:56.916 --> 25:57.750
were kind of...

25:58.333 --> 25:59.166
old.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.500
But I thought that--
that this place can be...

26:04.250 --> 26:05.083
how we do it.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.083
The neighborhood is gentrifying.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.375
You know, the white folks.

26:13.458 --> 26:15.416
And, uh, I was thinking

26:15.500 --> 26:18.083
I'd do a bar where you can do your...

26:18.166 --> 26:20.000
your wine thing, you know.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.708

to tell you, but, um...

27:08.041 --> 27:09.333

27:11.125 --> 27:14.625

27:26.500 --> 27:30.250
[takes a deep breath] well, uh,
I start in a few days.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.416
I mean, tuition's gonna wipe out
all my savings,

27:32.500 --> 27:33.791
[stammering] but I'm excited,

27:33.875 --> 27:36.375
you know? [steadily inhales and exhales]

27:37.250 --> 27:38.375
So-- So what do you think?

27:41.083 --> 27:42.125
I think you're a grown man.

27:42.625 --> 27:45.000
You don't want to run a restaurant,
don't run the restaurant.

28:00.041 --> 28:01.666
I won't let school get in the way of work.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.333
Okay. [stammers] I'm gonna close up.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.333
[footsteps retreating]

28:14.583 --> 28:15.625
[teacher 1] The Master exam

28:15.708 --> 28:18.291
is the hardest exam
you will ever take in your life.

28:18.875 --> 28:20.583
You will be tested on your theory.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.166
You will be tested on your service.

28:23.750 --> 28:26.250
And you will also be tested
on your blind tasting.

28:26.750 --> 28:29.541
The blind tasting
is the most important part

28:29.791 --> 28:31.208
of anything you will do.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.583
-[hip-hop music plays faintly]
-And this is the grid.

28:34.250 --> 28:35.791
This is what you will need to know

28:35.875 --> 28:38.791
to identify
each and every single wine properly.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.333
You will be tested on the sight

28:40.416 --> 28:42.208
and the clarity of the wine.

28:42.291 --> 28:43.666
You will be tested on the fruit

28:43.750 --> 28:45.333
and the non-fruit components.

28:45.416 --> 28:47.625
Acid, structure,

28:47.708 --> 28:49.666
balance. I need to know whether or not

28:49.750 --> 28:51.750
this wine is an Old World wine
or a New World wine.

28:52.750 --> 28:54.375
[teacher] <i>I need to know</i>
<i>the grape variety,</i>

28:54.458 --> 28:56.208
<i>and most importantly, the region.</i>

28:56.291 --> 28:58.541
[teacher 2] Of the five sub-regions,
there's Chablis,

28:58.625 --> 29:00.291
Côte de Nuits,

29:00.375 --> 29:02.166
Côte de Beaune, Côte Chalonnaise

29:02.250 --> 29:03.375
and Mâconnais.

29:03.458 --> 29:04.750
And within these sub-regions,

29:04.958 --> 29:07.291
there are 500 premier cru vineyards.

29:07.791 --> 29:10.666
Make sure about wines. About wine serving.

29:13.625 --> 29:14.708
Um...

29:15.333 --> 29:17.416
[exhales, blows air]

29:17.875 --> 29:20.125
[groans] All right.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.250
You studying?

29:22.916 --> 29:24.875
Yep. [sighs]

29:27.333 --> 29:28.166

29:29.083 --> 29:30.250
What are you doing?

29:30.333 --> 29:31.333
You almost done?

29:31.708 --> 29:32.541
No.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.916
Come here. This one might work.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.208
[Newton] What do you think?

29:56.750 --> 29:57.583
Like it?

30:00.291 --> 30:03.291
[teacher 3] Then cut the foil
at the bottom of the lip,

30:03.375 --> 30:05.875
then repeat the same on the back side.

30:05.958 --> 30:07.583
Then one last cut up.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.875
Now you can remove the foil.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.666
-[Elijah] All right, here it is.
-Good looking on this.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.583
Of course. Okay, if you're cooking
red meat, I'd go with the Pinot Noir.

30:15.666 --> 30:18.083
You cooking white,
I say the Albert Bichot La Moutonne.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.166
Moutonne.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.583
Oh, that sounds bold as hell.

30:20.666 --> 30:23.250
Yeah, I'm about to be Moutonne.
[rhythmic] You know this nigga down.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.416
They don't even know.
[laughs] And you know it's fancy,

30:25.500 --> 30:27.083
-because it's in cursive.
-[chuckles] Yep.

30:28.791 --> 30:30.166
-I appreciate you.
-Sure.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.708
Oh, Chablis. Yeah, that's cool.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.041
[Richie] How are you

30:36.125 --> 30:38.041
at the German varietals?

30:38.125 --> 30:38.958
I'm okay.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.708
These names are insane.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.375
Müller-Thurgau, Spätburgunder,

30:44.458 --> 30:45.916
Weissburgunder?

30:47.208 --> 30:48.125

30:49.958 --> 30:50.791
Hold up.

30:51.583 --> 30:54.416
Y'all using my favorite mug
as a spit cup?

30:56.833 --> 31:00.583
Oh, uh, [stammers] I told him
this was your favorite mug

31:00.666 --> 31:03.375
and Elijah was like, "Use this, Richie."
And I was like, "Are you sure?

31:03.458 --> 31:05.875
This looks like Tanya's special mug."
I mean, look at it.

31:05.958 --> 31:08.833
I just had a feeling about it.
[tentatively] Have a good time in there.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.041
I'm sorry, that usually works for me.

31:12.541 --> 31:14.041
Throwing my friends under the bus.

31:20.875 --> 31:22.583

31:25.625 --> 31:27.166

-It's only been a month.
-No, that's not the point.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.083
It pushed you though, right?

Look, it's impossible
to pass the Master exam

Oh, this is Tanya.
Tanya, this is my folks.

37:49.875 --> 37:50.708
Hi.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.166
Tanya's my, um...

37:53.833 --> 37:56.625
Oh, if I'm cleaning with you at midnight,
I'd better be your girlfriend.

37:56.708 --> 37:57.958
I know that's right.

38:00.750 --> 38:03.500
You said I had to finish up all this stuff
before I went to study group,

38:03.583 --> 38:06.416
so I just decided to come back
and knock it out tonight.

38:10.500 --> 38:13.125
[softly] He's right. You did say
the reason he couldn't switch shifts

38:13.208 --> 38:15.583
was that he had to work.
And so now he done finished the work.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.250
-You said that.
-[softly] I know. I know--

38:17.333 --> 38:19.291
I'm just trying to help you remember
what you said.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.458
[Louis] I know what I said.

38:20.541 --> 38:22.000
I don't need you to help me remember.

38:22.666 --> 38:24.750
Why don't you remember to DVR <i>Power?</i>

38:24.833 --> 38:25.791
-Really?
-Remember that?

38:27.041 --> 38:27.958
[Louis sighs]

38:28.375 --> 38:31.875
[stammering] So you... You, uh--
You finished everything?

38:33.250 --> 38:34.500
Uh, I'm about to.

38:37.041 --> 38:37.875
[Louis] Mm-hmm.

38:45.625 --> 38:46.500
So...

38:47.541 --> 38:48.791
I can go to study group?

38:48.875 --> 38:52.083
I mean, your work's done here, so...

38:54.916 --> 38:55.750
All right.

38:57.833 --> 38:59.708
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go finish the chickens.

39:02.875 --> 39:04.083
I like your hat.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.458
So are you funky now?

39:13.666 --> 39:16.250
-[car rushes past]
-I'm not feeling you right now.

39:17.541 --> 39:18.458
Yeah, you are.

39:21.541 --> 39:23.250
You're feeling me. Come on.

39:23.541 --> 39:24.666
[footsteps retreating]

39:26.208 --> 39:27.250
[sighs]

39:27.833 --> 39:30.500
Color, uh, red. Almost deep garnet.

39:30.583 --> 39:33.458
Slightly hazy, tiny bits of sediment.
[takes a breath]

39:35.458 --> 39:36.416
[sniffs]

39:36.500 --> 39:39.000
Smells of, uh, dried black cherry,
currents...

39:39.083 --> 39:41.125
No, no, no. Figs. [stammers]
It's figs, right?

39:41.208 --> 39:42.958
You know we can't tell you, man.

39:43.041 --> 39:44.291
[group laughs]

39:46.541 --> 39:48.000
[swishing liquid in mouth, spits]

39:49.083 --> 39:50.208
Hints of, uh,

39:50.291 --> 39:52.041
sweet and savory tones,

39:52.291 --> 39:54.125
-[taster snapping]
-like sage, bay leaf,

39:54.208 --> 39:55.208
cinnamon, vanilla?

39:55.291 --> 39:57.625
-[inhales] Uh, acidity, medium.
-[paper splats]

39:57.708 --> 39:59.083
[Harvard and Elijah laugh]

39:59.750 --> 40:00.666
[Richie] This is a Cab.

40:01.416 --> 40:03.458
[sighs] New World, high-quality producer.

40:03.541 --> 40:04.750
He's getting tight.

40:04.833 --> 40:05.750
[Richie] Fuck you.

40:05.833 --> 40:07.208
Possibly from Australia.

40:07.291 --> 40:08.583
[stammering] I'm calling it.

40:08.666 --> 40:10.583
Leeuwin Estate Art Series Cab.

40:10.750 --> 40:12.291
-[taster] What year?
-Ticktock, ticktock.

40:12.375 --> 40:14.000
-2007?
-[group dissents]

40:14.083 --> 40:15.416
[slams table] Fucking fuck!

40:15.500 --> 40:17.666
-It was a Cab, but it's a three from Napa.
-[cards splat]

40:17.750 --> 40:19.541
You need a towel.
Your whole face is sweaty.

40:19.625 --> 40:20.500
[both laugh]

40:22.291 --> 40:23.583
You guys switched the wines?

40:23.666 --> 40:25.166
Why would we switch the wines?

40:25.250 --> 40:26.750
-'Cause you're dicks.
-That's fair.

40:26.833 --> 40:27.791
[Harvard] Oh, shit.

40:27.875 --> 40:28.791
[Elijah] What?

40:29.041 --> 40:30.541
Our class is doing an exchange program

40:30.625 --> 40:32.583
-with our sister school in Paris.
-[Richie] What?

40:35.541 --> 40:37.791
We've got to pay for it though.
That's bad for me.

40:38.333 --> 40:39.333
That's bad for me.

40:39.416 --> 40:41.375
Dude, who gives a shit? It's Paris.

40:43.125 --> 40:44.333
What?

40:45.291 --> 40:46.125
Um...

40:47.500 --> 40:49.166
No, I just-- I probably can't go.

40:49.250 --> 40:50.625
What? You have to go.

40:51.041 --> 40:52.625
[stammers] It'll be like The Three Amigos

40:52.750 --> 40:53.708
only having two amigos.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.791
[stammers] Although three of us
will be going,

40:56.875 --> 40:58.750
so we will actually be The Three Amigos.

40:58.833 --> 40:59.666
Yeah.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.750
[sirens wailing in the distance]

41:03.333 --> 41:04.333
Let's get some fresh air.

41:06.708 --> 41:07.833
[door opens]

41:10.250 --> 41:11.208
We did switch the wines.

41:11.291 --> 41:12.125
Fuck...

41:12.625 --> 41:13.458
you.

41:14.666 --> 41:15.500
So...

41:16.000 --> 41:17.000
you really can't go?

41:17.291 --> 41:18.291
[birds chirping]

41:18.708 --> 41:21.666
I mean, I emptied out my savings
for the tuition, and...

41:22.166 --> 41:24.083
what, this trip's, like,
an extra ten grand?

41:24.625 --> 41:26.750
-[sighs]
-I mean, can't you ask your parents or...?

41:26.833 --> 41:28.875
[chuckles] No, they ain't got money
like that, man.

41:29.458 --> 41:30.291
I mean...

41:32.333 --> 41:33.166
[chuckles]

41:33.458 --> 41:36.875
me even being in school right now
is a whole thing for my pop, so...

41:38.416 --> 41:40.458
Yeah, man, [stammers] I get that.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.666
My dad is...

41:45.625 --> 41:47.416
He's not cool I'm in school either.

41:48.458 --> 41:49.541
But at the end of the day...

41:50.791 --> 41:52.333
[chuckles] I gotta do what I got to do.

41:52.416 --> 41:54.333
Hey, I hear you, but...

41:55.791 --> 41:56.625
you know...

41:57.125 --> 41:58.083
What if, uh...

41:59.166 --> 42:01.416
[clicks tongue] What if you and I
went half on everything?

42:03.541 --> 42:04.416
Could you do it then?

42:05.416 --> 42:07.083
So everybody in your class is going?

42:07.166 --> 42:08.000
Yep.

42:08.083 --> 42:10.041
-Harvard said he would split it with you?
-Yeah.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.958
-And Raylan said he's fine with it?
-Yes.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.083
-So why can't you go?
-'Cause I don't have the money.

42:14.750 --> 42:17.125
-But Paris is, like, it for wine, right?
-Yeah.

42:18.291 --> 42:21.416
Then, baby, you gotta go.
This is a real step towards what you--

42:21.500 --> 42:24.000
I know it's a real step.
You don't think I know it's a real step?

42:24.500 --> 42:26.333
-I do.
-Then why are you acting like I don't?

42:27.125 --> 42:29.000
-I'm not trying to fight with you.
-Are you sure?

42:29.666 --> 42:30.500
Yeah.

42:32.125 --> 42:34.875
I just, I don't get why you're not doing
everything you can to go.

42:38.625 --> 42:39.500
[Tanya inhales]

42:39.625 --> 42:42.041
It's not like you're doing
everything you need to be doing, so.

42:42.458 --> 42:44.625
-What?
-You're telling me what I need to do,

42:44.708 --> 42:45.708
but you aren't a nurse.

42:45.791 --> 42:47.000
Why don't you go back to school

42:47.083 --> 42:49.208
-instead of just being a receptionist?
-Fuck you.

42:49.291 --> 42:50.625
-When it's all so easy--
-Fuck you.

42:50.708 --> 42:51.541
Okay.

42:53.458 --> 42:54.291
[door slams]

42:54.833 --> 42:56.166
[crickets chirping]

42:58.333 --> 42:59.708
Want me to set the alarm?

43:02.458 --> 43:03.291
Okay.

43:05.625 --> 43:06.666
[Elijah sighs]

43:10.833 --> 43:12.416
So you're not gonna talk to me now?

43:15.333 --> 43:17.250
[clicks tongue] I mean, it's whatever.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.250
[train horn blows in the distance]

43:30.541 --> 43:31.375
I'm sorry.

43:38.708 --> 43:39.583
I'm sorry.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.291
I just don't wanna fuck it all up.

43:48.041 --> 43:49.333
Why would you fuck it up?

43:52.000 --> 43:53.583
I'm just so close.

44:00.750 --> 44:03.208
What if I get there and I'm no good?
Then what?

44:05.083 --> 44:06.208
[both sigh]

44:10.916 --> 44:13.708
It's not like I've got the money anyway,
so, whatever.

44:18.541 --> 44:20.833
[sighs] Your family can't help you?

44:20.916 --> 44:22.750
No. [scoffs]
They ain't got the money either.

44:23.291 --> 44:24.125
I know.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.291
Maybe they can help you get it.

44:32.416 --> 44:33.416
Anyone else?

44:33.500 --> 44:35.208
-[dishes clank]
-[J.T.] Give me some of that.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.458
It's a good bottle, E.

44:37.083 --> 44:37.916
[J.T. ] Mm.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.083
[sighs] What's it mean, "Grand Cru"?

44:40.166 --> 44:41.958
Yeah, that pretty much means
it's the best.

44:42.625 --> 44:46.291
Yeah. It's actually not that hard to read
a label. It's divided into five parts.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.541
The producer's name.

44:47.625 --> 44:49.000
The region it's from.

44:49.083 --> 44:51.000
The varietal.
Like whether it's a Cab or Merlot.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.333
-Hmm!
-[Elijah] The vintage,

44:52.416 --> 44:53.833
or the year the grapes are pulled.

44:53.916 --> 44:54.791
And then you got

44:54.875 --> 44:56.000
the alcohol level, which--

44:56.083 --> 44:57.208
Can I have more green beans?

44:57.833 --> 44:58.666
Why?

45:01.166 --> 45:02.541
Um... Let me see that.

45:03.041 --> 45:06.833
See, I didn't know that, you know,
every little thing on here

45:06.916 --> 45:08.208
had its own meaning.

45:08.625 --> 45:10.666
-That's something.
-[Tanya] You know, I don't know how

45:10.750 --> 45:13.708
Elijah memorizes all this stuff.
Sometimes when I wake up in the morning,

45:13.791 --> 45:15.333
he's still studying.

45:15.416 --> 45:17.083
So you be spending the night over there?

45:18.041 --> 45:19.125
Oh, no, no, just...

45:19.625 --> 45:21.291
Ooh... Y'all just over there sinning.

45:21.375 --> 45:22.375
Yeah, [snaps] um...

45:23.041 --> 45:23.875
You know what?

45:23.958 --> 45:27.416
It actually kind of helps
when I think of wine like barbecue.

45:27.875 --> 45:29.166
You know, uh, certain places

45:29.250 --> 45:30.958
just do certain things good.

45:31.041 --> 45:33.583
Like Memphis and ribs
or, uh, Texas and brisket.

45:34.541 --> 45:37.625
It's kind of like Argentina and Malbec
or Provence and rosé.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.583
What region would Dad's barbecue be from?

45:39.666 --> 45:41.333
-Courvoisier.
-[family laughs]

45:43.166 --> 45:44.875
-[Judy] You are so stupid.
-[J.T.] My bad.

45:46.916 --> 45:49.333
I'm just glad you've found something
you like.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.458
Oh, I'm just trying to stay focused.

45:51.541 --> 45:53.000
It's harder than you thought, huh?

45:55.875 --> 45:57.583
[clicks tongue] You know...

45:57.666 --> 45:59.291
You know what? At times, yeah.

45:59.875 --> 46:00.708
It always is.

46:01.791 --> 46:02.625
[Elijah] Hmm.

46:03.541 --> 46:05.541
I guess I'll get better at it
once I go to Paris.

46:05.625 --> 46:06.458
What?

46:06.541 --> 46:08.458
-[overlapping indistinct chatter]
-Yeah, no, um...

46:08.541 --> 46:09.666
[Newton] That's amazing, man.

46:09.750 --> 46:14.041
Uh, yeah, [laughs] uh, my class got asked
to go to Paris and study wine.

46:14.125 --> 46:15.125
When do you leave?

46:15.625 --> 46:17.500
Well, I don't--
I don't actually have the money.

46:17.583 --> 46:21.083
Not yet. But I'm gonna have at least half
when I sell my car.

46:21.166 --> 46:22.041
Wait, wait, wait.

46:22.125 --> 46:23.958
-You gotta sell your car?
-[J.T.] Come on, man,

46:24.041 --> 46:26.041
you can't sell the Nissan.
We got so many blow...

46:26.833 --> 46:28.333
Tires. Just flat...

46:28.833 --> 46:31.000
-tires is all. All over the place.
-[Judy] Hush.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.333
[Sylvia] Listen.

46:32.750 --> 46:35.666
Money, ain't never been the reason
nobody in this family did nothing.

46:35.750 --> 46:38.666
Okay? So if you're gonna sell your car
to come up with half,

46:38.791 --> 46:41.416
then we're gonna get together
and come up with the other half.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.750
-To my baby going to Paris!
-[family cheering]

46:43.833 --> 46:45.833
-[family laughing and clamoring]
-[glasses clink]

46:45.916 --> 46:47.875
-[truck beeping]
-[dog barking]

46:50.625 --> 46:51.916
[pigs snorting]

46:52.000 --> 46:53.125
[gate rattles]

46:53.208 --> 46:54.708
-[latch clanks]
-[pig squeals]

46:54.791 --> 46:56.916
-[mush splattering]
-[continued squealing]

46:58.291 --> 46:59.875
[machinery whirring]

47:01.875 --> 47:03.833
I'm gonna need you
to trim these a little more.

47:03.916 --> 47:05.666
The last few ribs had too much fat.

47:05.750 --> 47:07.416
-How much do you want me to cut?
-Eh, just--

47:07.500 --> 47:08.583
[phone chimes]

47:11.666 --> 47:12.666
[indistinct conversation]

47:12.750 --> 47:14.458
[phone chiming]

47:16.875 --> 47:18.750
-[keyboard clacking]
-[text whooshes]

47:18.916 --> 47:19.875
[Louis] Uh...

47:20.916 --> 47:22.500
At least a... a quarter of an inch.

47:22.583 --> 47:24.125
-[stammers] That's fine.
-Okay.

47:24.208 --> 47:25.791
[soul music playing]

47:25.875 --> 47:27.916
[indistinct excited chatter]

47:31.125 --> 47:33.708
Okay, can I have everybody's attention,
please?

47:34.291 --> 47:36.916
[shushes] Okay, shoo, shoo, shoo.
Okay, come on,

47:37.000 --> 47:38.500
everybody be quiet, alright?

47:38.583 --> 47:39.416
Hush it up.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.041
-[music stops]
-Don't mess up my moment.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.583
Uh, Elijah, come on up here.

47:43.541 --> 47:45.833
Okay, look at my baby.

47:45.916 --> 47:47.708
-Don't he look good?

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:41.833
Uh-huh.

1:00:42.250 --> 1:00:44.166
How's the new spot?
Are you gonna build a new bar?

1:00:44.250 --> 1:00:46.916
Maybe. You know, things change.
You know. You know...

1:00:48.125 --> 1:00:49.750
Okay, you know, I'll just call Mom back.

1:00:49.833 --> 1:00:51.208
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:52.125
[Elijah] All right.

1:00:54.250 --> 1:00:55.500
Hey, baby, how are you feeling?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.541
I'm alright. You know.

1:01:02.791 --> 1:01:03.666
Elijah.

1:01:03.750 --> 1:01:06.708
Really? [stammers] How's he doing?
How's Paris?

1:01:06.791 --> 1:01:07.875
Fine, but he wouldn't say.

1:01:08.500 --> 1:01:09.708
Well, what did he want then?

1:01:09.791 --> 1:01:11.083
Money, but he wouldn't ask.

1:01:11.458 --> 1:01:12.875
Oh, well, we've gotta give him some.

1:01:12.958 --> 1:01:15.500
How's he supposed to make money in France?
Being a mime?

1:01:15.583 --> 1:01:18.708
People hate mimes. But a black mime?
Ain't nobody trying to pay for that.

1:01:18.791 --> 1:01:20.458
-We ain't giving him no money.
-Yes, we are.

1:01:20.541 --> 1:01:21.708
No, we're not.

1:01:22.916 --> 1:01:23.875
Hey, baby.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:25.916
-Hey, y'all.
-[Louis] I'm gonna get you some water.

1:01:29.125 --> 1:01:31.958
Hey, Mama.
I brought you some books and magazines.

Boy, you got
a non-refundable plane ticket,

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:49.333
and we ain't got no more money.

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:50.458
I just need to see you.

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:52.041
<i>To see me to do what?</i>

1:01:52.125 --> 1:01:53.416

1:01:53.500 --> 1:01:55.125
You're in Paris. Do Paris shit.

you sent though. Those looked nice.

How's the food out there?
You had snails yet?

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:07.041
[scoffs] No.

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:09.583
School? Is school good?

Uh, my name is Elijah.
I'll be your sommelier this evening.

1:02:22.416 --> 1:02:24.041
Um, I heard it's a special occasion.

1:02:24.125 --> 1:02:25.666
It's our anniversary.

1:02:26.291 --> 1:02:27.416
Congratulations.

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:28.958
-Thank you.
-In that case,

1:02:29.041 --> 1:02:33.291
may I recommend the 2010 Estate Chardonnay
from Staglin Vineyards in Napa.

1:02:34.041 --> 1:02:36.625
Napa wine? But we are in France.

1:02:37.833 --> 1:02:38.708
[chuckles] Right.

1:02:39.375 --> 1:02:40.625
You are right. I'm so sorry.

1:02:40.708 --> 1:02:43.416
Uh, in that case, may I recommend
a very good French Chardonnay,

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:46.708
the, uh,
2007 Corton-Charlemagne Grand Cru?

1:02:47.208 --> 1:02:50.125
First, you suggest
a Californian Chardonnay.

1:02:50.208 --> 1:02:52.708
Now it's a French one.
You can't make up your mind?

1:02:52.791 --> 1:02:55.416
-No, I absolutely can. I--
-In a minute, he's going to suggest one

1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:57.291

You know what, as a matter of fact,

1:03:02.875 --> 1:03:04.791
I'll just remove
your red wine glasses and I'll--

I'm glad everyone saw this.

When you're a sommelier
and you're working,

1:03:22.875 --> 1:03:24.500
something like this will happen.

Now, what could Elijah
have done differently?

Yes?

Actually, he told me not to send it.

And I sent it anyway. [coughs] I'm just...
