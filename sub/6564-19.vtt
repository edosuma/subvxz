00:14.092 --> 00:15.183
You know your dancing stinks

00:15.184 --> 00:19.079
when your
invisible dance partner
is better than you are.

00:20.079 --> 00:21.171
I happen to be practicing

00:21.172 --> 00:24.095
for the slow dance
at the school formal.

00:24.096 --> 00:25.129
Hmm. In that case,

00:25.130 --> 00:28.129
you should practice sitting
on the side alone, crying.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.156
For your information,
I happen to have
a dance date.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.107
But... What?

00:34.108 --> 00:36.075
I thought
we were going to
the dance together.

00:36.076 --> 00:39.091
We are.
But I'm meeting Matt Tucker
there for a slow dance.

00:39.092 --> 00:41.136
Matt Tucker! Matt Tucker!

00:41.137 --> 00:43.157
Who's Matt Tucker?

00:43.158 --> 00:45.195
All you need to know
is that he's 6'2".

00:45.196 --> 00:48.120
And if I wanna wear heels
for my first slow dance,

00:48.121 --> 00:52.103
it was either him
or the center for the
girls' basketball team.

00:52.104 --> 00:54.191
Who didn't ask me.

00:54.192 --> 00:58.145
Well, it will
all be perfect after
I'm crowned Spring Queen,

00:58.146 --> 01:01.124
and then,
I'll have plenty
of royal subjects

01:01.125 --> 01:03.191
to command to dance with me.

01:03.192 --> 01:06.179
You do realize
you're not going to be
an actual queen, right?

01:08.146 --> 01:10.191
I cannot wait for this
Saturday night, either.

01:10.192 --> 01:12.158
I'm going to have
my picture taken

01:12.159 --> 01:15.095
wearing a special
handmade gown.

01:15.096 --> 01:16.187
It's nothing
like I usually wear.

01:16.188 --> 01:18.145
Oh, good.

01:18.146 --> 01:21.107
It's much more elaborate.

01:21.108 --> 01:23.174
How? Does it
shoot fireworks?

01:23.175 --> 01:27.141
Fingers crossed
I get the permits in time.

01:27.142 --> 01:30.182
Well, it all starts
this Saturday night
at 7:00.

01:30.183 --> 01:33.125
This will be
the most amazing
night of our lives!

01:36.113 --> 01:38.183
You can never say
something is going to
be amazing before it is.

01:38.184 --> 01:40.099
You'll jinx it.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.099
Okay, that is a ridiculous,
unfounded superstition.

01:43.100 --> 01:44.190
Ah! Great news!

01:44.191 --> 01:46.133
I just found out
<i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

01:46.134 --> 01:48.153
Is getting its own
Saturday night special!

01:48.154 --> 01:51.146
That's right, we're going
prime time, baby!

01:53.079 --> 01:56.087
It all starts at 7:00
this Saturday night.

01:59.079 --> 02:01.171
Exactly the same time
as the school formal.

02:04.146 --> 02:07.179
Oh, too little, too late.

02:13.083 --> 02:16.178
<i>♪ Everybody, everybody,
get out on the floor</i>

02:16.179 --> 02:20.153
<i>♪ It can get a little crazy
when the kick hits the 4</i>

02:20.154 --> 02:24.120
<i>♪ Make a scene, make a scene,
nobody can ignore</i>

02:24.121 --> 02:28.107
<i>♪ Don't knock it
till you rock it
We can't take it no more</i>

02:28.108 --> 02:32.086
<i>♪ Bring the lights up,
bust the doors down</i>

02:32.087 --> 02:35.191
<i>♪ Dust yourself off

02:35.192 --> 02:39.153
<i>♪ DJ set it off,
take it up a notch</i>

02:39.154 --> 02:43.166
<i>♪ All together now,

02:43.167 --> 02:47.120
<i>♪ Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

02:47.121 --> 02:51.112
<i>♪ And when you've had enough

02:51.113 --> 02:54.162
<i>♪ Bring the lights up,

02:54.163 --> 03:00.103
<i>♪ All together now,

03:07.439 --> 03:11.421
Yeah, roger that.
I've located Hessenheffer
and Jones.

03:11.422 --> 03:13.579
I have your tickets
for the Spring Formal.

03:13.611 --> 03:14.439
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

03:14.442 --> 03:16.442
Hey, what's the dealio
with the headset?

03:16.443 --> 03:18.454
What, are you dense,
or something?

03:20.418 --> 03:22.451
Hey. All I asked was...

03:22.452 --> 03:24.417
Oh!
I'm not talking to you.

03:24.418 --> 03:26.356
Of course I have to
approve the banner

03:26.369 --> 03:29.488
for the school dance
before it goes up! Duh!

03:29.489 --> 03:33.421
I'm in charge of the
Spring Formal this year
and it's gonna be awesome.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.421
Hmm, well, we cannot go.

03:35.422 --> 03:37.426
We have to dance on
<i>Shake It Up, Chicago!
</i> that night,

03:37.427 --> 03:39.488
thanks to the
red-headed jinx.

03:39.489 --> 03:44.455
Aw, too bad.
By the way, no refunds.

03:44.456 --> 03:46.497
But it doesn't
say that anywhere
on the tickets.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.510
Now it does.

03:52.476 --> 03:54.471
Good news!

03:54.472 --> 03:56.430
We are going
to the school dance

03:56.431 --> 03:59.430
and we're going
to dance on the
Saturday night special.

03:59.431 --> 04:01.459
Women today can work
and have personal lives.

04:01.460 --> 04:04.463
There is no reason why
we can't have it all.

04:04.464 --> 04:07.506
Nope, no reason.
Except we can't be
in two places at once.

04:08.493 --> 04:10.446
Or can we?

04:10.447 --> 04:12.455
Now, do you remember
that oral report I did

04:12.456 --> 04:14.431
about Chicago having
the most intricate

04:14.432 --> 04:16.497
underground tunnel system
in the United States?

04:18.447 --> 04:23.438
Do I?
Best nap ever!

04:23.439 --> 04:25.493
Now, obviously
we can't go running
back and forth

04:25.494 --> 04:27.430
through the streets at night,

04:27.431 --> 04:28.464
but what if we ran

04:30.418 --> 04:32.430
under the streets?

04:32.431 --> 04:34.413
You have my attention.

04:34.414 --> 04:36.497
But I reserve
the right to take it
back at any time.

04:36.498 --> 04:39.455
Okay. We only
have to make three
appearances in the show.

04:39.456 --> 04:43.446
The 7:00 check-in,
the dance in the middle,
and the finale.

04:43.447 --> 04:45.438
The rest of the time we'll be

04:45.439 --> 04:47.425
slow-dancing
with Matt Tucker.

04:47.426 --> 04:49.434
Getting crowned Spring Queen.

04:49.435 --> 04:53.417
Being photographed
in the most beautiful
gown in the world.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.431
And showing
that women
can have it all.

04:55.497 --> 04:57.451
Let's celebrate.

04:57.452 --> 04:59.502
Hey, Deuce!
A round of mango
strawberry smoothies!

04:59.503 --> 05:04.467
Uh, we're out of mangos,
strawberries, and smoothies.

05:04.468 --> 05:06.456
I guess you can't
really have it all.

05:11.506 --> 05:13.456
What the heck
is the matter with you?

05:15.426 --> 05:18.430
I haven't even
said anything yet.

05:18.431 --> 05:21.509
Not you, sweetie.
I'm on the phone with
the wannabe photographer.

05:21.510 --> 05:25.455
Look, I don't see how
shooting Oprah for the
cover of <i>Chicago Monthly</i>

05:25.456 --> 05:28.463
is more important
than my spring formal!

05:28.464 --> 05:30.492
Anything I can help with?

05:30.493 --> 05:33.434
Not unless
you can pull a photographer
out of that jacket of yours.

05:33.435 --> 05:36.492
Photographer?
No can do.

05:36.493 --> 05:39.505
But photographer,
slash videographer,
slash notary public?

05:39.506 --> 05:41.484
Yes, can do!

05:41.485 --> 05:43.464
My cousin Cherry's
boyfriend, Lumpy.

05:43.465 --> 05:46.425
Everything you need
for a special occasion,

05:46.426 --> 05:48.492
a wedding, a dance.

05:48.493 --> 05:51.442
Proof of citizenship.

05:51.443 --> 05:53.471
Okay, but he better
be a good photographer.

05:53.472 --> 05:55.455
Good? He's great.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.425
He takes mug shots
for a living.

05:57.426 --> 05:59.476
A lot of celebrities
ask for him by name.

06:06.849 --> 06:07.912
We only have 52 minutes.

06:07.913 --> 06:10.836
So, that gives
us plenty of time
to get to the school,

06:10.837 --> 06:12.856
hang out
and be back in time
for our dance number.

06:12.857 --> 06:13.895
I'm so excited.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.902
This is going to be
the best night ever.

06:15.903 --> 06:18.841
- CeCe!
- CeCe!

06:25.887 --> 06:27.898
Wow!

06:27.899 --> 06:30.848
So, how do I look?

06:30.849 --> 06:33.865
You know,
minus the spit
in my hair, of course.

06:33.866 --> 06:35.852
You look really pretty, CeCe.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.832
So do you, Rocky.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.836
Tinka, would you hurry it up?

06:40.837 --> 06:42.912
Okie-dokie,
I'm no slow-pokie!

06:45.908 --> 06:47.832
How do I look?

06:48.874 --> 06:51.823
Wow. I'm speechless.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.837
In that case,
I should wear
this more often.

06:54.866 --> 06:56.823
Now, which one of you is going

06:56.824 --> 06:58.895
to crawl under my dress
and put on my shoes?

07:00.837 --> 07:01.866
She is.

07:10.832 --> 07:11.912
Huh? Huh?
What do you think?

07:13.866 --> 07:16.907
Hey, what's black and white
and has one giant eyebrow?

07:16.908 --> 07:18.832
You!

07:19.866 --> 07:21.902
Oh, yeah? Well,
what's nine years old,

07:21.903 --> 07:24.848
smells funny and
makes a lot of noise?

07:24.849 --> 07:25.874
Our refrigerator.

07:26.849 --> 07:28.844
No! You!

07:28.845 --> 07:30.882
And I changed
because as soon as
your mom comes home,

07:30.883 --> 07:33.831
I'm out of here
and meeting Dina
at the formal.

07:33.832 --> 07:34.911
But first,

07:34.912 --> 07:36.837
do you have any tweezers?

07:39.862 --> 07:42.832
I'll get it, Mom!

07:43.908 --> 07:45.861
Dude, it's my phone.

07:45.862 --> 07:47.891
I know. I just like
yelling in your face.

07:50.820 --> 07:51.882
Hey, Lumpy.
How's it going?

07:52.853 --> 07:54.841
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

07:55.837 --> 07:57.831
Really? Okay.

07:57.832 --> 07:59.831
Yeah, yeah. Bye.

07:59.832 --> 08:01.823
Oh, no.

08:01.824 --> 08:03.819
Dina's gonna freak out!

08:03.820 --> 08:05.819
Lumpy can't take
pictures at the dance.

08:05.820 --> 08:06.853
He's stuck at the bank.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.862
There's a robbery in progress.

08:14.853 --> 08:17.840
My mom's going to
need you to babysit me
for the rest of the night.

08:17.841 --> 08:18.887
She's stuck at work.

08:18.888 --> 08:21.844
Some photographer,
slash videographer,
slash notary public

08:21.845 --> 08:22.874
is holding up a bank.

08:32.878 --> 08:34.890
Wow, this tunnel is so cool!

08:34.890 --> 08:37.885
I know!
You may recall from
my research report

08:37.886 --> 08:39.845
that they were
originally built for...

08:39.846 --> 08:43.828
Tinka! Rocky's talking
about her research
report again! Hurry up!

08:43.895 --> 08:45.915
Oh! Give me a break!

08:45.916 --> 08:50.848
You two aren't
wearing 15 pounds
of beautiful dress.

08:50.849 --> 08:53.848
Hate to break it to you,
but neither are you.

08:53.849 --> 08:56.840
Oh, no!

08:56.841 --> 08:58.881
One of my layers
has ripped off.

08:58.882 --> 09:01.887
Now everyone
will stare at me
when I get to the dance.

09:03.899 --> 09:08.836
Yeah, now they're
gonna stare at you.

09:08.837 --> 09:11.890
Okay. Just remember
it's really easy to get
to the school from here.

09:11.891 --> 09:15.890
All you have to do
is left, right, left,
and then a left, left, right.

09:15.891 --> 09:18.878
Hey, just like our
dance in the finale!

09:22.858 --> 09:26.881
Tinka, would you
stop trying to scare us
with those snake sounds?

09:26.882 --> 09:28.837
I'm not making snake sounds.

09:31.845 --> 09:35.836
Just kidding. I was
making snake sounds.

09:35.837 --> 09:37.882
That will teach you
to mock my layers.

09:47.845 --> 09:49.840
You really outdid
yourself, Dina.

09:49.841 --> 09:51.844
I mean, everything
looks beautiful.

09:51.845 --> 09:53.915
Oh! Thank you, Deucie.

09:53.916 --> 09:57.898
But the most
beautiful thing
in the room is you.

09:57.899 --> 10:01.831
And your hair.
And your eyes.

10:01.832 --> 10:02.916
And your forgiving nature.

10:04.858 --> 10:06.874
Spill your guts, Martinez.

10:09.837 --> 10:10.891
Deuce is too
chicken to tell you,

10:10.892 --> 10:12.911
but the photographer canceled.

10:12.912 --> 10:16.899
But the good news is
I'll be joining you two
on your date tonight.

10:18.832 --> 10:19.870
Dude, don't just stand there,

10:19.871 --> 10:21.878
go get me and Dina some punch.

10:22.882 --> 10:25.845
Don't worry.
I'll handle the punch.

10:33.849 --> 10:34.874
How do we look?

10:34.875 --> 10:38.823
Great! Except
you have a little bit
of cobweb on your back.

10:38.824 --> 10:39.866
Oh, so do you, CeCe.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.831
Okay.
I'll get it.

10:41.832 --> 10:42.895
Well, somebody check me!

10:43.891 --> 10:45.824
- Ugh.
- Okay.

10:50.912 --> 10:54.820
Hey. Wow,
it looks great.

10:56.845 --> 10:58.852
So, I'm gonna
go find Matt Tucker.

10:58.853 --> 11:00.864
And I'm gonna
go say hi to the
Spring Queen crown

11:00.865 --> 11:01.878
that's on display.

11:01.879 --> 11:04.886
And I'm going to
get my picture taken.

11:04.887 --> 11:08.881
So, how long do we have
before we have to head back
to <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!?</i>

11:08.882 --> 11:10.827
Let's see, we had 52 minutes,

11:10.828 --> 11:11.899
it took us
10 minutes to change,

11:11.900 --> 11:14.840
15 minutes to get Tinka's
dress through the exit,

11:14.841 --> 11:16.848
five minutes to get here,

11:16.849 --> 11:19.836
another eight minutes
to get Tinka's dress
through the entrance,

11:19.837 --> 11:21.848
and adding the time
it'll take us to get back

11:21.849 --> 11:23.831
and change for
our dance number,

11:23.832 --> 11:25.916
we have to leave right now.

11:27.845 --> 11:28.866
- What?
- What?

11:28.869 --> 11:30.820
Yes, now!
Go! Go! Go!

11:33.858 --> 11:35.831
We've got three minutes!

11:35.832 --> 11:37.912
Okay, you pull and I'll push.

11:38.916 --> 11:40.916
It's not working!

11:43.882 --> 11:46.870
Ahhh! There really
are snakes down here!

11:51.824 --> 11:53.895
It's fine. You know,
we're having it all,
we're living the dream!

11:53.896 --> 11:55.827
Okay, CeCe, zip me up.

11:55.828 --> 11:56.853
Oh! Okay.

11:57.895 --> 12:00.852
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you!

12:00.853 --> 12:03.836
Where have we been?
Where have you been?

12:03.837 --> 12:06.869
Yeah!
We have been looking for you!

12:06.870 --> 12:09.827
You have? Why?

12:09.828 --> 12:12.823
Because the show
is about to start
in 10 seconds

12:12.824 --> 12:14.841
and you still
have to get out there
and introduce us.

12:15.832 --> 12:17.848
Right, of course.

12:17.849 --> 12:19.524
Thanks for having
my back, you guys.

12:22.882 --> 12:25.844
You're going
to be over the moon
for this next dance

12:25.845 --> 12:28.852
that's blasting off
in four, three,

12:28.853 --> 12:29.908
two, boom!

14:03.841 --> 14:05.852
Yes! Yes! We did it!

14:05.853 --> 14:07.852
We danced on the
Saturday night special,

14:07.853 --> 14:09.877
and now
we have almost
an hour at the dance

14:09.878 --> 14:11.853
to make all of
our dreams come true.

14:11.854 --> 14:15.827
This night
will be perfect
for all of us.

14:15.828 --> 14:17.848
We're having some
technical difficulties.

14:17.849 --> 14:19.870
This could
take a while.
Hang tight.

14:21.820 --> 14:22.832
Oops.

14:24.887 --> 14:26.862
Now you guys are
just spitting at me.

14:26.863 --> 14:28.845
You are correct.

14:36.017 --> 14:37.076
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

14:37.077 --> 14:40.000
They're crowning
the queen in 15 minutes.

14:45.013 --> 14:47.016
Great.
Thanks to you,

14:47.017 --> 14:49.030
now I only have
seven layers left.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.026
You're welcome!

14:59.017 --> 15:00.067
I can't get my helmet off.

15:02.030 --> 15:04.075
Come on, come on,
we have to go.

15:04.076 --> 15:07.066
I am wearing a space helmet.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.050
What will Matt Tucker say?

15:10.017 --> 15:12.000
"What an improvement"?

15:16.038 --> 15:19.995
Yeah.
Looking good! All right.

15:19.996 --> 15:23.016
Deucie, I need you now!
We have a code five at
the fruit punch fountain!

15:23.017 --> 15:25.055
- What's a code five?
- Don't question me!

15:27.026 --> 15:29.025
Jones, you're on photo duty.

15:29.026 --> 15:30.067
Am I really the
best choice for the...

15:30.068 --> 15:32.030
Yes, ma'am.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.076
Next!

15:36.000 --> 15:38.083
Beautiful.
Move a little to the left.

15:38.084 --> 15:40.059
Big smile, big smile, and...

15:41.992 --> 15:44.030
Got it!
That's a keeper.

15:46.084 --> 15:49.079
Next!

15:49.080 --> 15:53.030
Hey, weren't you just
here taking a picture with
that smokin' hot blonde?

15:56.067 --> 15:58.012
Hey, where are you going?

15:58.013 --> 16:00.020
Just trying to make memories!

16:00.021 --> 16:01.034
Next!

16:03.988 --> 16:08.016
Okay, I get it.
You decided you
didn't need dates.

16:08.017 --> 16:10.079
Yeah, bro power!

16:10.080 --> 16:13.076
Everybody,
on the count of
three, say "losers!"

16:16.034 --> 16:17.996
Left, right, left! Ow!

16:19.000 --> 16:20.034
Ow!

16:21.063 --> 16:23.005
Ow!

16:27.017 --> 16:28.076
Stupid tunnel!

16:36.050 --> 16:38.995
Dina, did you
crown the queen yet?

16:38.996 --> 16:41.079
Yeah.
Good news, you won!

16:41.080 --> 16:43.042
- I did?
- Yes!

16:43.045 --> 16:47.033
But since you weren't here,
they gave the crown
to Cathy Davis.

16:47.034 --> 16:49.083
Cathy Davis?
Cathy Davis?

16:49.084 --> 16:51.009
Who's Cathy Davis?

16:51.988 --> 16:53.028
What I want to know is

16:53.029 --> 16:54.065
who's not turning off
their microphone

16:54.066 --> 16:56.059
when they're
going to the bathroom?

16:58.030 --> 17:00.012
Rocky, did you hear?

17:00.013 --> 17:02.991
I won, but I lost the crown.

17:02.992 --> 17:05.050
Why couldn't I have lost
and won the crown?

17:06.055 --> 17:08.025
Really, you're
complaining to me?

17:08.026 --> 17:09.079
Because if you haven't noticed,

17:09.080 --> 17:12.026
I am wearing
a toaster oven on my head!

17:13.059 --> 17:15.040
Now, please go find Matt Tucker

17:15.041 --> 17:17.034
and ask him to save
a slow dance for me.

17:19.034 --> 17:22.012
I don't know why
this picture line
is taking so long.

17:22.012 --> 17:24.055
It is as if they have
a child behind the camera.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.067
We're running out of time!

17:28.068 --> 17:30.029
I need to get my picture taken

17:30.030 --> 17:32.041
before I lose another
layer of my dress.

17:32.042 --> 17:34.017
I only have six layers left.

17:36.030 --> 17:39.083
Wait, four.
Why are there only four?

17:39.084 --> 17:42.009
Uh, you must have miscounted.

17:46.988 --> 17:48.057
Oh no, it's Gary.

17:48.058 --> 17:50.032
He says,
"A dance crew
didn't show up

17:50.033 --> 17:52.028
"and they're
moving up the finale."

17:52.029 --> 17:54.021
We have to go right now.
Could you go find CeCe?

17:54.022 --> 17:55.055
Okay.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.079
Hey, cool space helmet.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.076
If you can get it off,
you can have it.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.049
Oh! It'll be easy.

18:08.050 --> 18:12.005
We can just run
through the tunnels.
We can have it all.

18:13.017 --> 18:14.063
I don't know about you two,

18:14.064 --> 18:16.058
but I no longer want it all.

18:16.059 --> 18:21.021
All I want is a towel.
I'm sweating like a yak
during slaughter season.

18:30.046 --> 18:31.686
<i>♪ Break the frame
Break the frame ♪</i>

18:31.687 --> 18:33.074
Hey, do you hear that?
It kind of sounds like

18:33.075 --> 18:35.067
the song we have
to dance to
in the finale.

18:35.068 --> 18:38.020
That's because it is
the song we have to dance
to during the finale.

18:38.021 --> 18:39.987
Now go! Go! Go!

18:39.988 --> 18:41.992
Go, CeCe, go!
Go, go, go, go!

18:44.026 --> 18:46.050
<i>♪ Gotta break the frame
We're not the same</i>

18:46.051 --> 18:49.080
<i>♪ At the edge of the mirror ♪</i>

18:54.996 --> 18:57.026
Ha! Wow! Great job, guys.

18:59.005 --> 19:01.999
Hey! Thanks for
letting us shake up your
Saturday night, Chicago.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.037
And, Susie Stonehouse, see?

19:04.038 --> 19:07.029
I told you I had
to work tonight.

19:07.030 --> 19:09.050
This is Gary Wilde saying
good night, everybody!

19:13.046 --> 19:15.019
You know
I gotta talk to
Jessica in wardrobe.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.992
She's making the
weirdest choices lately.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.063
- Well, uh...
- Don't defend her.

19:20.066 --> 19:22.020
I mean, look at my tie.

19:22.021 --> 19:23.059
It doesn't even match my socks.

19:24.026 --> 19:25.026
Okay, that's...

19:28.034 --> 19:31.033
I'm sorry, guys.
We missed most
of the finale,

19:31.034 --> 19:33.012
CeCe missed her crown,

19:33.013 --> 19:34.011
you never got your picture,

19:34.012 --> 19:35.646
and I'm never gonna
get my slow dance.

19:36.992 --> 19:39.004
This was a bad idea on my part.

19:39.005 --> 19:41.025
We should just forget
the whole thing.

19:41.026 --> 19:44.025
Well, maybe
I didn't get my crown,

19:44.026 --> 19:47.016
but you two
still have time
to get your dreams,

19:47.017 --> 19:49.005
and I'm gonna
make sure it happens.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.033
Thank you, CeCe.

19:51.034 --> 19:53.021
You know what? You're right.
I'm not going to give up.

19:53.022 --> 19:55.066
Me either!
Back to the ladder!

19:55.067 --> 19:57.996
Oh, Forget the ladder!
We're taking a cab!

20:06.992 --> 20:10.012
We're too late.
The dance is over.

20:10.013 --> 20:11.059
Thanks for trying, CeCe,

20:11.060 --> 20:14.025
but it looks like
I missed my slow dance
with Matt Tucker.

20:14.026 --> 20:17.080
But perhaps it's not
too late for me to get
my picture taken.

20:21.021 --> 20:23.029
You know, maybe
it's just a big lie.

20:23.030 --> 20:25.009
Maybe you can't
really have it all.

20:25.996 --> 20:28.046
Or maybe you can.

20:30.013 --> 20:32.021
Dina?

20:33.996 --> 20:35.038
I got your text, CeCe.

20:35.039 --> 20:38.058
No one leaves a Dina Garcia
production unhappy.

20:38.059 --> 20:41.016
We're a go, people.
The eagle is hungry!

20:41.017 --> 20:43.030
Repeat, the eagle is hungry!

20:49.021 --> 20:51.988
- Hey, Rocky.
- Hey, Matt Tucker.

20:53.021 --> 20:54.021
I thought you left.

20:54.022 --> 20:56.012
Uh, I did.
I was at home in bed

20:56.013 --> 21:00.038
when two of Deuce's
cousins showed up and,
uh, insisted I come back.

21:02.021 --> 21:05.075
But I'm glad they did.

21:05.076 --> 21:07.026
May I have this dance?

21:18.026 --> 21:19.063
Any chance
you could send someone

21:19.064 --> 21:23.066
to Cathy Davis' house
and get me my crown back?

21:23.067 --> 21:25.025
Way ahead of you.

21:25.026 --> 21:28.996
She fought like
a dog, but I got it.

21:31.030 --> 21:32.071
May I have this dance?

21:54.525 --> 21:55.584
What do you think you're doing?

21:55.585 --> 21:57.545
Uh, packing up.

21:57.546 --> 21:59.516
But I want my picture taken.

21:59.517 --> 22:01.583
Oh. Sorry, Tinka.
It's been a long night.

22:01.584 --> 22:04.521
I'm exhausted
and I'm done
taking pictures.

22:05.580 --> 22:08.558
Deuce, I am warning you.

22:08.559 --> 22:11.524
I lost one layer
getting into the taxi cab

22:11.525 --> 22:13.508
and one layer getting out.

22:13.509 --> 22:16.496
So, snap my picture
before I snap you.

22:17.580 --> 22:20.525
Now that I think about it,
what's one more photo, right?

22:26.567 --> 22:27.587
All right.

22:27.588 --> 22:29.508
Oh, wait, Tinka.

22:29.509 --> 22:31.530
You got, like,
one little thread.

22:31.580 --> 22:33.567
Right there.

22:37.571 --> 22:39.496
I got it.

22:40.504 --> 22:42.575
Just take the picture. Now!

22:50.575 --> 22:53.570
Wow! You look beautiful.

22:53.571 --> 22:56.529
My dress. It's so

22:56.530 --> 23:00.537
simple, understated
and refined.

23:00.538 --> 23:01.584
I hate it!

23:02.571 --> 23:05.496
This whole day
was a total waste!
