over and over.
-Oh, I know that guy.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.925

Works for "Vanity Fair," right?

12:40.009 --> 12:41.135
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.139
None of us should
talk to the media.

12:45.222 --> 12:48.225
Yeah, I agree. It'll hurt
the case against Barry.

You should talk to him.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113

like you did me.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.865

this close to my--

13:02.948 --> 13:06.660
You scared the shit
outta me. (sighs)

the international contacts

13:33.687 --> 13:36.482

into the country secretly,

13:36.565 --> 13:39.068
