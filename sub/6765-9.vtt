00:16.375 --> 00:17.842
Dylan!

00:19.411 --> 00:20.571
Dylan?!

00:20.612 --> 00:22.580
Dylan!

00:22.614 --> 00:23.603
Huh?

00:25.717 --> 00:27.048
Hang on!

00:43.135 --> 00:44.227
Hi.

00:44.269 --> 00:46.294
l'm, uh, l'm sorry
to wake you.

00:46.338 --> 00:47.498
Why did you?

00:47.539 --> 00:49.700
Look, l know this
is unexpected,

00:49.741 --> 00:52.369
and l would've called but l
didn't think you'd talk to me.

00:52.411 --> 00:55.244
May l come in?

00:55.280 --> 00:56.713
Yeah...

00:56.748 --> 00:57.942
Yeah.

01:01.086 --> 01:02.986
You know what's funny?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.319
ln all these years,
this is the first time

01:05.357 --> 01:06.415
l've been to your house.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.926
Yeah, well,
it's kind of messed up.

01:08.961 --> 01:11.555
Here... Have a seat.

01:14.366 --> 01:15.560
Thanks.

01:18.303 --> 01:20.999
Look, Dylan, l know this
is a rough time for you.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.199
Are you all right?

01:22.241 --> 01:23.333
Yeah, l'm getting by.

01:23.375 --> 01:26.538
''Getting by''
is no way to live.

01:26.578 --> 01:28.011
Yeah, we don't
always have a choice.

01:28.113 --> 01:31.879
You're not alone, Dylan.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.578
l appreciate the sentiment,

01:33.619 --> 01:37.885
but, uh, what l got broke here,
you can't fix.

01:38.957 --> 01:41.357
Look, l came over
today because l...

01:41.393 --> 01:44.556
because Jim and l feel

01:44.596 --> 01:46.496
that it's time to start over,

01:46.532 --> 01:49.023
to put whatever's
gotten in the way

01:49.067 --> 01:51.365
of our relationship behind us.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.030
And he stayed home
from work today

01:53.071 --> 01:54.629
so that he could talk to you.

01:54.673 --> 01:56.903
l got a phone.

01:56.942 --> 01:57.909
He knows the number.

01:57.943 --> 01:59.308
Please, Dylan.

01:59.344 --> 02:02.836
l have asked you for very few
favors along the way,

02:02.881 --> 02:05.315
but l am asking now.

02:05.350 --> 02:06.647
Please.

02:06.685 --> 02:09.518
Just come back
to the house with me.

02:11.190 --> 02:12.987
Why are you doing this?

02:13.025 --> 02:14.788
Because l care about you.

02:14.826 --> 02:16.691
We care.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.668
Yeah, just...

02:27.706 --> 02:29.537
just let me get cleaned up.

02:29.575 --> 02:30.906
Sure.

04:22.688 --> 04:24.849
l guess some
things never change.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.687
Let's, uh, go in
the living room.

04:31.129 --> 04:32.994
lt's an ambush. You lied to me.

04:33.065 --> 04:36.330
Dylan, my name is Ellen Marks.

04:36.368 --> 04:37.835
l'm an alcoholism counselor.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.860
Your parents must be so proud.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.998
Don't tell me, this
is the part where l say,

04:42.040 --> 04:44.372
''Hi, l'm Dylan.
l'm an alcoholic.''

04:44.409 --> 04:45.933
Your friends are
worried about you.

04:45.977 --> 04:47.001
Who asked you?

04:47.112 --> 04:48.704
Come on, man, why
don't you sit down?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.442
Mind your own business, Brandon.

04:50.482 --> 04:54.145
Dylan, it took a lot
of time and effort

04:54.186 --> 04:55.881
for everyone to
come here today.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.013
You know what?

04:57.122 --> 04:59.022
lf l need help, l'll go to AA.

04:59.057 --> 05:01.719
lt took a lot of courage
for everyone to do this.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.193
l think you at least

05:03.228 --> 05:05.560
owe it to them to listen,
don't you?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.827
l don't even know you,
so where do you get off

05:07.866 --> 05:09.925
telling me who l owe what to?

05:09.968 --> 05:11.697
Hmm?

05:12.704 --> 05:17.368
This better be good,
better be entertaining,

05:17.409 --> 05:18.740
or l'm leaving.

05:23.014 --> 05:23.981
Who'd like to start?

05:24.082 --> 05:25.982
Look, Dylan,

05:26.017 --> 05:28.645
you might have given up
on yourself,

05:28.687 --> 05:31.315
but l'm here for
a very selfish reason.

05:31.356 --> 05:32.983
You saved my life once.

05:33.024 --> 05:34.651
We were up on a mountain

05:34.693 --> 05:36.854
when we were camping
that time, you remember?

05:36.895 --> 05:38.795
Yeah, l remember. So what?

05:38.830 --> 05:40.991
So, when l see you
getting all boozed up

05:41.032 --> 05:42.260
and all geezed up on coke

05:42.300 --> 05:44.666
or whatever you're
killing yourself with,

05:44.703 --> 05:47.001
l can't help thinking...

05:47.038 --> 05:49.506
what's gonna happen next time,
if you're not there?

05:49.541 --> 05:51.338
You fall off the mountain.

05:51.376 --> 05:53.367
l'm not in the savior
business, Brandon.

05:53.412 --> 05:56.381
Yeah, well, l can't agree
with you on that one, Dylan.

05:56.415 --> 05:58.007
Did you forget about
the little incident

05:58.049 --> 05:59.607
that happened over
at the beach apartment?

05:59.651 --> 06:03.610
l was wasted on meth,
cops were banging on the door.

06:03.655 --> 06:04.815
You saved me then.

06:04.856 --> 06:08.485
Look, David buried a
friend in high school.

06:08.527 --> 06:11.291
Brandon just buried
another one.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.263
Dylan, we don't want
to bury you.

06:13.298 --> 06:14.822
So put your shovels away,

06:14.866 --> 06:17.130
'cause nobody's
dying here, all right?

06:17.169 --> 06:18.136
l'm fine.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.068
You're not fine.

06:19.104 --> 06:19.968
l'm fine!

06:20.005 --> 06:21.165
People who get high

06:21.206 --> 06:23.731
and play with guns
are not fine.

07:06.184 --> 07:07.617
Val?

07:07.652 --> 07:08.619
Hi, Clare.

07:08.653 --> 07:09.620
Hi. How are you?

07:09.654 --> 07:10.621
Good.

07:10.655 --> 07:12.486
So, are you, uh,
eyeing or buying?

07:12.524 --> 07:13.684
Oh, l wish.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.488
l can't afford this stuff.

07:15.527 --> 07:17.825
Well, that's why they
call it window shopping.

07:17.863 --> 07:19.330
Right.

07:19.364 --> 07:20.956
You know, l can't imagine

07:20.999 --> 07:22.296
what it must have been like

07:22.334 --> 07:23.631
to grow up in Beverly Hills.

07:23.668 --> 07:24.828
Me, either.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.303
You mean you're not from here?

07:26.338 --> 07:27.965
God, no.

07:28.006 --> 07:29.303
We moved here
from Washington

07:29.341 --> 07:31.172
when my dad got tenure at CU.

07:31.209 --> 07:32.403
Aren't you from
Buffalo or something?

07:32.444 --> 07:33.968
Actually, Minneapolis.

07:34.012 --> 07:36.173
l grew up across the street
from the Walshes.

07:36.214 --> 07:38.978
Brenda and l used to be best
friends until we moved away.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.644
l didn't really know
Brenda that well.

07:40.685 --> 07:42.846
Really? Well, you
would've liked her.

07:42.888 --> 07:45.516
She used to send me these long
letters about how hard it was

07:45.557 --> 07:47.787
to grow up in Beverly Hills
and fit into the crowd.

07:47.826 --> 07:49.316
Speaking of fitting in,

07:49.361 --> 07:50.988
why aren't you over
at the Walshes today

07:51.029 --> 07:52.519
for the big powwow?

07:52.564 --> 07:54.191
Well, l talked
it over with Brandon

07:54.232 --> 07:56.325
and l don't belong there.

07:56.368 --> 07:58.529
l don't really know Dylan
that well.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.333
l thought you went out with him.

08:00.372 --> 08:02.465
No, we just kind of
hung out a couple times.

08:02.507 --> 08:03.701
Oh.

08:04.976 --> 08:08.935
Look, the truth is,
l wasn't invited.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.847
Well, l guess we're not
members of the club yet.

08:14.819 --> 08:16.286
Most interventions,

08:16.321 --> 08:20.621
l try and encourage people to
write down and sort of reflect

08:20.659 --> 08:22.286
on how the other
person's drug abuse

08:22.327 --> 08:25.296
has affected their lives.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.355
But from what your friends
have told me, Dylan,

08:27.399 --> 08:28.730
it doesn't
seem as though

08:28.767 --> 08:31.497
you've hurt anyone in
this room half as much

08:31.536 --> 08:33.163
as you've hurt yourself.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.501
l take exception to that.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.167
Go ahead, Nat.

08:37.207 --> 08:39.506
You know, partner,

08:39.544 --> 08:42.011
l can forgive almost
anything except stealing.

08:44.015 --> 08:45.175
You didn't think l noticed

08:45.216 --> 08:47.377
the night you told
Steve his count was off

08:47.419 --> 08:50.320
when we closed the
Peach Pit After Dark?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.346
That you would steal from me,

08:52.390 --> 08:54.517
after everything
we've been through.

08:54.559 --> 08:55.651
l'll pay you back, Nat.

08:55.694 --> 08:57.218
lt's too late for that.

08:57.262 --> 08:59.230
You better get
your head screwed on

08:59.264 --> 09:01.528
straight, and fast,

09:01.566 --> 09:03.796
because you keep going
like you're going,

09:03.835 --> 09:05.097
you're gonna die.

09:05.136 --> 09:08.663
l'm not gonna die.
l'm not gonna die.

09:08.707 --> 09:10.436
You know, l appreciate this,

09:10.475 --> 09:11.635
all you guys getting
together like this,

09:11.676 --> 09:13.803
but it's getting kind of
ridiculous now, so l'm going.

09:13.845 --> 09:14.869
Dylan!

09:14.913 --> 09:16.608
Wait.

09:16.648 --> 09:17.945
Listen...

09:17.983 --> 09:20.645
if you have one ounce
of self-esteem left,

09:20.685 --> 09:24.143
one breath of the
instinct for survival,

09:24.189 --> 09:25.952
then you'll turn around
and you'll sit down

09:25.991 --> 09:28.585
and listen to what your friends
are trying to tell you.

09:28.627 --> 09:31.619
because the moment you
cross over that threshold,

09:31.663 --> 09:33.324
there is no turning back.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.957
Well, then,
l must not have any,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.695
'cause, like l said,
l'm leaving.

09:36.735 --> 09:37.724
Good.

09:38.737 --> 09:40.102
Personally, l think this

09:40.138 --> 09:41.503
is a huge waste of time.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.939
Drunk or sober, l still think
my good buddy Dylan McKay

09:43.975 --> 09:45.840
would have found some
way to hit on Valerie.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.572
Come on, Steve! Look...

09:47.612 --> 09:49.170
No, you look. l don't think

09:49.214 --> 09:51.512
you're worth the bottle you're
trying to crawl out of, pal.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.313
And if you're not
gonna leave, then l am.

09:54.352 --> 09:56.115
What, y-you think that's
the way l wanted it, man?

09:56.154 --> 09:57.314
lt was all her fault.

09:57.355 --> 09:59.789
l told her l didn't want
you to get hurt in this.

09:59.824 --> 10:01.985
Oh, well,
that's very big of you.

10:02.027 --> 10:05.986
Steve, go... go back in there
and sit down.

10:06.031 --> 10:07.623
l... if you stay, l'll stay.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.631
l'll listen.

10:20.578 --> 10:22.375
l heard you come in last night.

10:24.382 --> 10:26.509
What was it, about
4:00 in the morning?

10:26.551 --> 10:28.712
Didn't check my watch.

10:28.753 --> 10:32.018
You out with that
Donna girl again?

10:32.057 --> 10:33.547
No, just hanging out
with the guys.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.355
What did l tell you
about priorities?

10:36.394 --> 10:38.828
You can't just leave a girl
hanging, waiting by the phone.

10:38.863 --> 10:40.558
She was studying, Mama.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.361
She goes to school, remember?

10:42.400 --> 10:43.833
Course l remember.

10:43.868 --> 10:45.631
What l especially
remember the most, though,

10:45.670 --> 10:47.035
is that she lives
in Beverly Hills.

10:47.105 --> 10:50.370
Will you just let me eat my
breakfast in peace, please?

10:50.408 --> 10:53.104
Will you just tell me
one thing, please?

10:54.746 --> 10:56.611
What part of Beverly Hills
is she from?

10:57.849 --> 10:59.146
l don't know.
What's the difference?

10:59.184 --> 11:02.984
Only about a million or two.

11:03.054 --> 11:06.649
You see, the really rich folk
live north of Sunset Boulevard.

11:06.691 --> 11:09.455
Everybody else is just trying
to keep up with the Joneses.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.621
Well, l am not after
Donna's money, Mother.

11:11.663 --> 11:13.426
Course you're not.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.263
You listen to your mama.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.893
lt's just as easy
to fall in love

11:17.936 --> 11:20.097
with a rich girl
as it is a poor one.

11:24.242 --> 11:26.904
l never had any brothers
or sisters,

11:26.945 --> 11:27.934
ln high school, Dylan,

11:27.979 --> 11:30.004
l always thought of you
as a big brother.

11:30.115 --> 11:33.312
And l guess that's why
it's so hard for me to say this,

11:33.351 --> 11:36.809
but that night you crashed
my mother's fund-raiser,

11:36.855 --> 11:38.584
l lost so much respect for you.

11:38.623 --> 11:39.988
Look, Donna...

11:40.024 --> 11:42.117
You know, everyone there
at the hotel that night

11:42.160 --> 11:44.025
is gonna remember you
as some obnoxious drunk

11:44.095 --> 11:46.256
who put his cowboy boots
up on the table

11:46.297 --> 11:48.492
and tried to pick a fight
with his best friend.

11:48.533 --> 11:50.728
Well, l'm sorry,

11:50.769 --> 11:52.669
but l don't want
to remember you that way.

11:52.704 --> 11:54.137
So don't.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.697
Why don't you remember me as
the guy who drove to your house

11:56.741 --> 11:57.708
the next day to apologize?

11:57.742 --> 12:00.233
Yeah, l do.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.371
And l also remember
you promised to meet me

12:02.413 --> 12:04.779
at registration so we could
take some classes together.

12:04.816 --> 12:06.306
Look, my not going back
to school

12:06.351 --> 12:08.785
had nothing
to do with you, okay?

12:08.820 --> 12:10.287
That's right.
lt was the drugs.

12:10.321 --> 12:12.915
Otherwise, why would a person
with your passionate

12:12.957 --> 12:14.982
intellect for learning
turn your back on everything

12:15.059 --> 12:16.219
that you know and love?

12:16.261 --> 12:17.990
Well, you know
how it is, Andrea,

12:18.062 --> 12:19.723
you always hurt the ones
you love, right?

12:19.764 --> 12:23.131
l guess that's why you never
came by to see Hannah.

12:23.168 --> 12:26.069
l've been busy.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.873
Look, Dylan, l know
we didn't have the easiest

12:30.909 --> 12:34.367
time together, but at least,
when you were sober,

12:34.412 --> 12:38.542
you had more dignity than
the guy l found licking salt

12:38.583 --> 12:40.107
off the neck
of a glorified hooker.

12:40.151 --> 12:43.245
What, did you do that
to humiliate me?

12:43.288 --> 12:45.620
To pay me back for falling
in love with someone else?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.417
'Cause if you did, it worked.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.724
l was humiliated.

12:57.569 --> 12:59.628
Can l go to the bathroom?

12:59.671 --> 13:00.638
ls that allowed?

13:00.672 --> 13:02.663
Sure.
We're not going anywhere.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.254
All right...

13:58.296 --> 13:59.923
so what's the game plan?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.023
ls this the part where
all your little guilt trips

14:02.066 --> 14:03.727
you laid on me are supposed
to culminate

14:03.768 --> 14:05.360
in the big realization
l'm a bad guy?

14:05.403 --> 14:08.270
l'm supposed to beg you all
for forgiveness?

14:08.306 --> 14:10.900
Don't hold your breath.
lt ain't gonna happen.

14:10.942 --> 14:12.466
What is gonna happen?

14:12.510 --> 14:14.375
Well, l don't know-- you're
the professional drug lady.

14:14.412 --> 14:15.504
Why don't you tell me?

14:15.546 --> 14:20.381
Well, we've packed
a bag for you.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.182
And there's a bed waiting
in a very good hospital.

14:25.123 --> 14:27.421
That's not gonna happen.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.982
l'm not going to a hospital.

14:29.027 --> 14:31.825
l'm just... l...
l'll go to meetings,

14:31.863 --> 14:34.229
l'll talk to people,
but l'll handle it myself.

14:34.265 --> 14:36.392
l'm not so sure of that.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.129
You're not so sure?

14:38.169 --> 14:41.536
ls that what you want,
all of you?

14:41.572 --> 14:43.005
Are you sure?

14:43.107 --> 14:45.598
Can you fix my problem?

14:45.643 --> 14:47.508
'Cause l can do that.

14:47.545 --> 14:48.807
l can go to rehab.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.814
l can do two weeks in rehab
standing on my head.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.112
What you got to be ready
for is the result

14:53.151 --> 14:54.743
of your little experiment
when l get out,

14:54.786 --> 14:57.414
'cause you know what l think
you're gonna see?

14:57.455 --> 15:00.356
l think you're gonna see that
you all need me to be sick.

15:00.391 --> 15:03.519
Yeah, 'cause that way,
you look a lot better.

15:03.561 --> 15:05.495
See, your lives, they all
look perfect and shiny,

15:05.530 --> 15:08.226
but only compared to my
pathetic little existence,
right?

15:10.234 --> 15:12.361
Well, l'm sick of giving you
the satisfaction.

15:13.938 --> 15:15.803
Yeah, l'll go.

15:18.309 --> 15:20.140
Grab the bag.

15:34.859 --> 15:36.850
Oh, l'm exhausted.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.987
You guys did good.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.088
l hope so.

15:41.132 --> 15:44.192
l just hope l did as much
for Dylan as he did for me.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.998
Well, before you go to sleep,

15:46.070 --> 15:49.233
l have an idea to take
your mind off all that.

15:49.273 --> 15:51.002
What?

15:51.109 --> 15:53.737
Do we have any blank tape?

15:53.778 --> 15:55.837
What?!

15:55.880 --> 15:58.314
Blank tape. Do we have any?

15:58.349 --> 15:59.782
l don't know.
Whatever's over there.

16:01.652 --> 16:04.485
We don't need this old air check
of me and Donna, do we?

16:04.522 --> 16:06.114
No.

16:06.157 --> 16:07.715
Good.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.193
l don't understand.

16:10.228 --> 16:12.253
What do you, what do you
want a videotape for?

16:12.296 --> 16:17.825
l've tried, l can't take it,
your love's how l make it...

16:17.869 --> 16:19.302
l don't know.

16:19.337 --> 16:21.999
l was just thinking.

16:23.374 --> 16:24.739
Aren't you kind of curious

16:24.776 --> 16:26.937
to see what
we look like on TV?

16:26.978 --> 16:31.381
But Clare, we're on,
we're on TV every day.

16:31.416 --> 16:33.407
ls that thing on already?

16:33.451 --> 16:37.387
You're a nutcase,
you know that?

16:37.422 --> 16:38.889
Say cheese.

16:38.923 --> 16:42.415
Cheese.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.984
Mmm...

16:44.028 --> 16:44.995
You want this off?

16:45.063 --> 16:46.121
Uh-huh...

16:48.166 --> 16:50.566
l wonder how Dylan's doing.

16:50.601 --> 16:52.125
Well, from what my mom says,

16:52.170 --> 16:53.797
the first night in rehab's
always the hardest.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.829
Yeah, well, l just hope
we did the right thing.

16:55.873 --> 16:57.170
We did.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.642
Great... You know, David
doesn't even live here anymore

16:59.677 --> 17:02.237
and he's still leaving his
cartons empty in the fridge.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.474
What bothers you more,

17:03.514 --> 17:05.641
the empty cartons or the
sleeping arrangements?

17:05.683 --> 17:07.674
Well, l need my vitamin C.

17:07.718 --> 17:10.414
As far as everything else,
l could care less.

17:10.454 --> 17:12.582
So, the whole Clare-David thing
doesn't bother you at all?

17:12.623 --> 17:14.113
Not anymore.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.251
l mean, it took
a little getting used to,

17:16.294 --> 17:17.818
but it's not like l don't have
a boyfriend.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.489
l thought it was boyfriends.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.964
No, l told Griffin l didn't want
to see him anymore.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.296
How'd he take it?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.394
A lot better than
my mom's going to.

17:26.436 --> 17:29.429
She thinks he's coming to dinner
tomorrow night.

17:31.075 --> 17:32.167
Hello?

17:32.210 --> 17:33.268
Sorry to call so late,

17:33.311 --> 17:34.801
but you are not going
to believe this.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.143
Hi, Mom. What?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.169
Guess.

17:37.215 --> 17:38.978
You're getting married again.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.415
No, it's not about me.
lt's about you.

17:41.452 --> 17:42.851
What about me?

17:42.887 --> 17:45.412
Seventeen magazine called.

17:45.456 --> 17:47.924
They saw your proofs
from our mother/daughter shoot,

17:47.959 --> 17:48.926
and they want you.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.723
-For what?
-A layout, silly.

17:50.761 --> 17:52.319
They want to see you tomorrow.
Can you believe it?

17:52.363 --> 17:55.264
Mom, l-l have classes.
l can't.

17:55.299 --> 17:57.233
You have nothing
as important as this.

17:57.268 --> 17:59.327
l don't want to.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.496
Kelly, this is an opportunity

18:00.538 --> 18:02.369
most girls would give
their eyeteeth for.

18:02.406 --> 18:06.206
Just go with me on this;
at least check it out.

18:06.244 --> 18:07.211
Okay, Mom.

18:07.245 --> 18:08.212
Great.

18:08.246 --> 18:09.213
l'll pick you up at noon.

18:09.247 --> 18:10.305
Be ready. l love you.

18:10.348 --> 18:13.112
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:13.151 --> 18:16.086
So what was that all about?

18:16.120 --> 18:17.485
My domineering mother.

18:17.522 --> 18:21.390
l wonder whose mom is worse,
yours or mine?

18:21.425 --> 18:23.757
For tonight,
let's call it a tie.

18:25.429 --> 18:27.795
So, how long you plan on
staring at that ceiling?

18:27.832 --> 18:29.197
l'm gonna stare at that ceiling

18:29.233 --> 18:30.894
till l figure out
why in the hell

18:30.935 --> 18:33.028
l let 'em drag me here
in the first place.

18:34.105 --> 18:37.131
You're doing a damn sight better
than l was my first morning.

18:37.175 --> 18:38.233
l was so busy puking,

18:38.276 --> 18:39.709
l couldn't even tell
where l was.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.305
What the hell is that?

18:44.348 --> 18:45.815
lt's chow time.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.182
lf you're not there in five
minutes, you don't eat.

18:48.219 --> 18:49.447
Ooh, it's like a boot camp.

18:49.487 --> 18:52.422
Hey, just take one day
at a time, man.

18:53.691 --> 18:55.784
What'd you say your name was?

18:55.826 --> 18:57.453
-Everybody up! Breakfast call!
-Kirk.

18:57.495 --> 19:01.226
Yeah, listen, Kirk,
l've been to AA before.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.325
l know the drill, okay?

19:04.368 --> 19:06.359
So, where can l get a paper
around here?

19:06.404 --> 19:07.371
Sorry, pal.

19:07.405 --> 19:09.270
No papers, no phones, no TV.

19:09.307 --> 19:10.467
Got the Big Book, though,

19:10.508 --> 19:11.941
if you're looking
for something to read.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.102
No, thanks.

19:13.144 --> 19:15.169
l... l'm gonna wait
for the movie.

19:15.213 --> 19:16.475
Ah...

19:16.514 --> 19:17.811
A funny drunk.

19:17.848 --> 19:19.179
We like those around here.

19:19.217 --> 19:21.515
Livens up the place a bit.

19:21.552 --> 19:23.747
You do drink, don't you?

19:23.788 --> 19:25.688
Among other things.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.782
Me, l'd start off
with a fifth of vodka,

19:27.825 --> 19:30.521
sometimes tequila,
sometimes gin-- whatever.

19:30.561 --> 19:32.392
Then when my inhibitions were
thoroughly cooked...

19:32.430 --> 19:33.454
Kirk...

19:35.166 --> 19:36.133
shut up.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.431
You know what l mean?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.268
l'll see you at breakfast.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.769
Mom?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.335
ln here, honey.

19:50.748 --> 19:51.737
Hi, Mom. Hi, Lucille.

19:51.782 --> 19:52.976
Hi, baby.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.416
Oh, everything
looks beautiful.

19:54.452 --> 19:55.544
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.

19:55.586 --> 19:56.985
Would you hand me
the fish forks?

19:57.021 --> 20:00.218
l thought we'd start with
shrimp in tomato aspic,

20:00.258 --> 20:03.785
and Lucille is going to make
her famous rack of lamb.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.787
You know, l'm not so sure
this is such a good idea.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.299
Oh, if Griffin doesn't
eat red meat,

20:09.333 --> 20:10.698
we can always have chicken.

20:10.735 --> 20:12.327
No, it's not that.

20:12.370 --> 20:15.635
Mom, Griffin and l aren't seeing
each other anymore.

20:15.673 --> 20:18.437
What?! What happened?

20:18.476 --> 20:20.444
lt just didn't work out.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.571
Oh, honey!

20:22.613 --> 20:25.173
Griffin is such a wonderful boy.

20:25.216 --> 20:26.843
He was so perfect for you.

20:26.884 --> 20:29.751
Mom, please stop trying
to arrange my life.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.414
l'm not trying
to arrange your life.

20:31.455 --> 20:32.945
l just want you to be happy.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.355
l am happy.

20:34.392 --> 20:35.518
l'm very happy.

20:35.559 --> 20:37.220
ln fact,
l have another boyfriend.

20:37.261 --> 20:38.888
Oh, you do?

20:38.929 --> 20:39.918
What's his name?

20:39.964 --> 20:42.330
Ray. Ray Pruit.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.994
Aha. Daddy plays golf
with a Pruit.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.025
Jefferson Pruit.

20:46.103 --> 20:47.263
The stockbroker.

20:47.305 --> 20:49.170
l don't think they're related.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.367
Okay.
Well, what's your Pruit like?

20:51.409 --> 20:53.570
Where's he from?
Did you meet him at school?

20:53.611 --> 20:56.478
Um, yeah, l-l guess.

20:56.514 --> 20:58.243
Great.
What year is he in?

20:58.282 --> 20:59.306
What's he studying?

20:59.350 --> 21:00.840
He's not in school anymore.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.785
He graduated?

21:02.820 --> 21:04.879
Not exactly.

21:04.922 --> 21:07.152
He's a musician.

21:07.191 --> 21:10.957
Ah! Concert pianist, no doubt.

21:10.995 --> 21:15.193
No, Mom, he plays the guitar
and he writes some great songs.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.132
Well, where is this brilliant
troubadour from?

21:17.168 --> 21:20.695
-Reseda.
-Reseda...

21:20.738 --> 21:23.536
Mother, you are such a snob.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.007
You know,
l can't believe this.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.009
No, l'm not a snob.

21:26.077 --> 21:28.011
l'm just concerned about you.

21:28.112 --> 21:30.376
l mean, do you really know
anything about this boy?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.575
Do you know anything about
his family, his background?

21:32.616 --> 21:34.641
l know that he's sweet
and he's nice

21:34.685 --> 21:36.414
and he's cute,
and l like him.

21:36.454 --> 21:39.855
Well, in my book,
that's just not good enough.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.654
Well, in my book it is.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.025
Okay.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.194
Honey, l'm sure he is
a lovely young man.

21:52.236 --> 21:53.396
As a matter of fact,

21:53.437 --> 21:55.200
why don't you invite him
to dinner tonight?

21:55.239 --> 21:56.866
Daddy and l would
love to meet him.

21:56.907 --> 21:59.137
l don't know.

21:59.176 --> 22:00.666
l mean, it's kind
of short notice.

22:00.711 --> 22:03.202
Well, honey, if he's as
special as you say he is,

22:03.247 --> 22:04.805
l'm sure he'll go out
of his way for you.

22:04.849 --> 22:07.579
Dinner's at 7:00
We'll see you then.

22:10.721 --> 22:11.915
He's nice, Lucille.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.389
He really is.

22:13.424 --> 22:15.824
Better tell him
to wear a necktie.

22:15.860 --> 22:17.828
Right.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.929
Kelly, Jackie,
great to meet you.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.492
-l'm Lisa Murchinson.
-Hi.

22:25.536 --> 22:27.436
Would anyone like
something to drink?

22:27.471 --> 22:28.904
-lced tea, coffee?
-Oh, no, thanks.

22:28.939 --> 22:29.906
l'll have some water.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.431
Would you like to take a seat?

22:36.013 --> 22:38.743
Well, you are even prettier
than your pictures.

22:38.783 --> 22:40.273
Claude has such
a good eye.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.477
Thank you.

22:41.519 --> 22:43.214
l have known Claude for years.

22:43.254 --> 22:44.881
We started out
together in New York.

22:44.922 --> 22:47.823
ln fact, l've been in Seventeen
a few times myself.

22:47.858 --> 22:51.259
So, what we're thinking about
is a campus spread.

22:51.295 --> 22:53.593
We don't want models,
just real girls,

22:53.631 --> 22:55.963
college girls--
we'll use the same
group throughout

22:56.000 --> 22:58.867
the year for maybe four to six
layouts as the seasons change.

22:58.903 --> 23:00.370
That sounds great,
doesn't it, Kel?

23:00.404 --> 23:01.735
Mm-hmm.

23:01.772 --> 23:03.171
Well, it's a lot of work,

23:03.207 --> 23:04.435
but you'll be
handsomely rewarded,

23:04.475 --> 23:06.705
and l promise it'll be
an awful lot of fun.

23:06.744 --> 23:08.974
When l did my first shoot,
back at Ohio State,

23:09.046 --> 23:11.310
we were all wearing
plaids and saddle shoes.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.179
We did the whole thing
with the football team--

23:13.217 --> 23:14.650
they picked us up
on their shoulders.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.152
lt was such a hoot.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.087
Jackie... would you mind

23:18.122 --> 23:20.420
if l had a few minutes
alone with Kelly?

23:20.458 --> 23:22.119
Oh, no. Of course.

23:22.159 --> 23:24.150
l'll be outside.

23:27.398 --> 23:30.367
Well... you don't seem
too excited about all this.

23:30.401 --> 23:32.369
Oh, no, l am.

23:32.403 --> 23:35.668
lt's just, l modeled
a little when l was a kid,

23:35.706 --> 23:38.231
and l have to admit,
it was fun, but...

23:38.275 --> 23:40.436
l watched
what it did to my mother.

23:40.478 --> 23:42.946
We're not talking
about a career choice, Kelly.

23:42.980 --> 23:45.244
Good.

23:45.282 --> 23:47.944
Look, this isn't a
high-pressure situation.

23:47.985 --> 23:49.350
The fact is,
you're a beautiful girl,

23:49.386 --> 23:51.115
and l know we'll have
a great time together

23:51.155 --> 23:52.486
if you give me half a chance.

23:52.523 --> 23:54.957
Well, it does sound tempting.

23:54.992 --> 23:56.687
Can l get back to you?

23:56.727 --> 23:57.989
Of course.

23:58.028 --> 24:00.553
And if it doesn't work out,
no hard feelings.

24:00.598 --> 24:02.623
Except maybe between
you and your mother.

24:05.769 --> 24:07.737
Dr. Parker.

24:07.771 --> 24:09.705
Yeah, they told me
you were the guy to see

24:09.740 --> 24:11.071
about signing myself
out of this place.

24:11.108 --> 24:12.632
You were just
admitted last night--

24:12.676 --> 24:14.974
with drugs in your pocket
we had to confiscate.

24:15.045 --> 24:17.707
l made a mistake;
l don't belong in here.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.579
Oh, l see.

24:19.617 --> 24:21.244
And why is that?

24:21.285 --> 24:24.311
lf l have any problems,
l'll just handle them by myself.

24:24.355 --> 24:26.380
Your friends tell me
you walk around

24:26.423 --> 24:28.391
like a zombie half the time.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.417
That's not a normal life
for someone as bright

24:31.462 --> 24:32.759
and talented as you.

24:32.796 --> 24:33.990
What is normal?

24:34.064 --> 24:35.622
Give it a chance, Dylan.

24:35.666 --> 24:36.997
Just one more day.

24:37.101 --> 24:38.932
Because if you don't,
we both know

24:38.969 --> 24:41.938
it's only a matter of time
till you wind up dead

24:41.972 --> 24:45.339
or in jail or in
an institution.

24:45.376 --> 24:47.674
We both know...

24:47.711 --> 24:49.872
everybody winds up somewhere.

24:49.914 --> 24:51.882
You know what
it's like out there, Dylan.

24:51.916 --> 24:53.383
lt's not gonna get any better.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.386
l'll take my chances.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.114
Okay.

25:01.158 --> 25:04.252
You signed yourself in,
you can sign yourself out.

25:04.295 --> 25:08.425
That's right.

25:08.465 --> 25:10.057
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

25:10.100 --> 25:12.830
l have a friend of mine who's
a patient here-- Dylan McKay.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.269
l'm sorry, no visitors.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.500
l know that-- l just brought
some things for him.

25:16.540 --> 25:18.167
Well, we'll have to examine it.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.073
Uh, no, that
won't be necessary.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.010
''Get out of jail free'' card.

25:23.881 --> 25:25.610
Y-You're not staying?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.310
Oh, l like that--
you're real observant.

25:27.351 --> 25:28.477
Dylan, are you sure

25:28.519 --> 25:29.850
you're doing the right thing?

25:29.887 --> 25:31.115
Hey, you're not
gonna start on me,

25:31.155 --> 25:32.782
are you, 'cause
what l need is a ride.

25:32.823 --> 25:35.314
lf you're not gonna give it
to me, l got to call a cab.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.986
Okay, the car's outside.

25:37.027 --> 25:37.994
All right.

25:38.028 --> 25:40.019
Sayonara, sweetheart.

25:44.702 --> 25:45.896
How could you people let him

25:45.936 --> 25:47.369
just walk out of there
like that?

25:47.404 --> 25:48.393
Honey, let me say something.

25:48.439 --> 25:49.497
That doesn't matter.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.167
You know what state
of mind he was in.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.334
Cindy.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.003
Would you hold on
just a minute, please?

25:54.044 --> 25:57.673
Honey, we have
to face the facts.

25:57.715 --> 26:00.149
We did everything we could.

26:00.184 --> 26:02.379
lt'll never be enough.

26:09.393 --> 26:10.951
l've got an idea.

26:10.995 --> 26:13.930
Does it involve getting naked?

26:13.964 --> 26:15.932
Where's the video?

26:15.966 --> 26:18.434
What?

26:18.469 --> 26:21.233
The video-- the one me
and you made, remember?

26:21.271 --> 26:23.535
How could l forget?

26:23.574 --> 26:25.439
Let's watch it.

26:25.476 --> 26:28.843
Uh... right now?

26:28.879 --> 26:32.406
Mm, l didn't know
you were such a ham.

26:38.555 --> 26:39.647
What's wrong?

26:39.690 --> 26:41.180
lt's not here.

26:41.225 --> 26:42.988
-Well, check in the camera.
-No, no.

26:43.027 --> 26:45.757
l took it out of the camera,
and l stuck it right here.

26:45.796 --> 26:47.491
Well, check anyway.

26:48.699 --> 26:50.667
lt's not in here, David.

26:50.701 --> 26:53.499
Well, then where is it?

26:53.537 --> 26:54.526
l don't know.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.004
What do you mean,
you don't know?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.008
A videocassette doesn't
just get up and walk away.

26:58.042 --> 26:59.100
Look for it!

26:59.143 --> 27:00.974
Just relax, okay?
Stop yelling at me.

27:01.011 --> 27:02.603
l'm looking, okay?

27:03.947 --> 27:07.144
Clare, if this tape is gone,
we're in big trouble.

27:09.086 --> 27:11.714
You sure you told your friend
to be here at 7:00?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.814
l'm sure he'll be here
any minute.

27:13.857 --> 27:16.257
Well, what's the rush?
The lamb's already ruined.

27:16.293 --> 27:17.487
lt is not, Mom.

27:17.528 --> 27:18.961
All right,
come on, you two.

27:19.029 --> 27:20.257
We're gonna wait a few minutes,

27:20.297 --> 27:21.730
and then we're gonna
start without him.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.357
Meanwhile,

27:23.400 --> 27:25.425
l want to see
that tape you brought over.

27:25.469 --> 27:28.370
Oh, yes! We want to see
our daughter on television.

27:28.405 --> 27:29.463
lt's just an air check.

27:29.506 --> 27:31.906
We're gonna love it,
no matter what it is.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.603
Okay.

27:43.554 --> 27:45.488
Oh, that must be Ray.

27:46.490 --> 27:47.957
Saved by the bell.

27:47.991 --> 27:50.687
Yeah, well, that's more
than l can say for my dinner.

27:50.728 --> 27:51.956
Be nice.

27:51.995 --> 27:53.485
l'm always nice.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.794
Mom, Dad, l'd like you
to meet Ray Pruit.

27:58.836 --> 28:00.599
Mr. Martin, nice to meet you.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.763
lt's Dr. Martin.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.933
Sorry... uh...
these are for you.

28:05.042 --> 28:06.134
How sweet.

28:06.176 --> 28:07.666
Thank you, you shouldn't have.

28:07.711 --> 28:08.678
l'm sorry l'm late.

28:08.712 --> 28:10.339
l took a wrong turn
on San Ysidro.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.938
We're just happy you made it.

28:12.015 --> 28:13.039
Have a seat.

28:13.083 --> 28:15.415
We're about to watch a tape
of Donna on television.

28:15.452 --> 28:16.680
Daddy, not... not now.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.778
l agree with Donna.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.254
Let's save that
for after dinner.

28:19.289 --> 28:21.416
lt might give us something
to look forward to.

28:21.458 --> 28:23.221
l'm gonna go
put these in water.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.694
Excuse me.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.369
Hi, guys.
Sorry l'm late.

28:33.403 --> 28:34.529
Hi. lt's okay.

28:34.571 --> 28:36.300
We went ahead and
ordered some nibbles.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.308
Great, l'm starving.
So what's the big deal?

28:38.342 --> 28:39.536
What are we celebrating?

28:39.576 --> 28:41.544
Say hello to America's
hottest new face.

28:41.578 --> 28:43.136
Congratulations, Jackie.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.841
Not me, silly.

28:44.882 --> 28:46.110
Kelly.

28:48.285 --> 28:49.946
That's great.
Why didn't you say anything?

28:49.987 --> 28:52.547
l didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

28:52.589 --> 28:54.614
Typical-- her face
is gonna be the envy

28:54.658 --> 28:55.955
of every teenage
girl in America;

28:55.993 --> 28:58.393
she doesn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

28:58.428 --> 29:00.293
l still have no idea
what l'm gonna order.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.729
l don't even know
why l'm bothering.

29:01.765 --> 29:02.732
l can't eat, anyway.

29:02.766 --> 29:04.393
Kelly...

29:04.434 --> 29:06.868
nobody said anything
about your weight.

29:06.904 --> 29:09.236
Mom, when's the last time
you saw a chubby cover girl?

29:09.273 --> 29:11.264
Ladies, time out.
Please-- time.

29:11.308 --> 29:13.640
Why don't we, uh, change
the subject, huh?

29:13.677 --> 29:15.144
Good idea.

29:15.179 --> 29:16.612
How's Dylan doing?

29:16.647 --> 29:18.046
Okay, l guess.

29:18.081 --> 29:19.343
l hope.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.045
l think what you guys
did was very brave.

29:22.085 --> 29:23.882
l wish l'd had friends
like all of you

29:23.921 --> 29:24.910
when l was in trouble.

29:28.425 --> 29:30.655
Just keep it. Thanks.

29:30.694 --> 29:32.958
Whew! Good to be back.

29:32.996 --> 29:34.588
You wouldn't believe
what they were passing off

29:34.631 --> 29:35.962
as food at the cuckoo's nest.

29:36.033 --> 29:36.965
Well, you know, Dylan,

29:37.067 --> 29:38.329
you weren't there
for the cuisine.

29:38.368 --> 29:40.563
l told you not to start
with me about that.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.936
l do not need to be in a rehab.

29:42.973 --> 29:44.338
Fine.

29:44.374 --> 29:45.671
Beer?

29:45.709 --> 29:47.643
Yeah, you can't eat
mushu without it.

29:47.678 --> 29:48.736
Oh, is that so?

29:50.013 --> 29:51.241
Yes, that is so.

29:51.281 --> 29:53.408
What are you, some kind
of watchdog or something?

29:53.450 --> 29:56.317
l mean, l thought of all people,
you'd be cool with this.

29:56.353 --> 29:57.615
Dylan... you know,

29:57.654 --> 30:00.452
getting drunk out of your mind
is really not that cool.

30:00.490 --> 30:02.981
Well, here's a beer;
there is the door.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.391
The choice is yours.
What's it gonna be?

30:05.429 --> 30:07.522
Hm?

30:07.564 --> 30:08.690
Fine.

30:08.732 --> 30:10.222
That's right. Come here.

30:15.005 --> 30:16.597
Aren't you gonna get that?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.006
Why, are you expecting
a call or something?

30:19.109 --> 30:20.633
-No.
-Hm?

30:20.677 --> 30:23.111
Leave a message, sucker.

30:24.381 --> 30:26.008
Dylan, it's Cindy.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.710
Please call.
We're very worried about you.

30:28.752 --> 30:31.721
Yeah, well, that didn't
take long, did it?

30:43.100 --> 30:45.830
You hardly touched
your appetizer, Ray.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.598
Not everyone likes aspic.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.003
lncluding me.

30:49.039 --> 30:50.836
She just makes it
to torture us.

30:50.874 --> 30:52.739
All right, Donna.

30:52.776 --> 30:55.040
lt was very good; l'm just
not a big fan of tomatoes.

30:55.078 --> 30:57.046
Well, l'm sure you'll
love the lamb.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.012
Although it may be
slightly overcooked.

31:00.951 --> 31:03.681
So, Ray, tell us a little
bit about yourself.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.120
Were you brought up
here in Los Angeles?

31:06.156 --> 31:07.680
No, uh, San Bernardino.

31:07.724 --> 31:09.783
My family's
originally from Oklahoma.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.418
Oklahoma.

31:11.461 --> 31:14.157
We ran into a lot
of Oklahoma people--

31:14.197 --> 31:16.722
oil people--
in Houston this summer.

31:16.767 --> 31:18.701
Well, my family's
not in oil, ma'am.

31:18.735 --> 31:21.260
Uh, except for my uncle--
he was a rigger.

31:21.305 --> 31:24.274
l don't think
you'd have met him.

31:24.308 --> 31:26.139
What does your family do?

31:26.176 --> 31:27.370
Daddy...

31:27.411 --> 31:29.311
A little of this,
little of that.

31:29.346 --> 31:31.007
That's exactly how
my family started.

31:31.114 --> 31:32.411
Are you in school?

31:32.449 --> 31:34.007
Uh, no, sir,
l work construction.

31:34.084 --> 31:36.552
Ray's a musician, Daddy.

31:36.586 --> 31:37.610
Really?

31:37.654 --> 31:39.383
Don't try
and build me up, Donna.

31:39.423 --> 31:41.914
Look, the fact is,
l don't really come from much,

31:41.959 --> 31:43.859
and l don't know
where l'm going.

31:43.894 --> 31:46.021
lf that's a problem
for you, l'm sorry,

31:46.129 --> 31:48.427
but that's all there is.

31:53.170 --> 31:56.662
Mmm... the lamb looks great,
Mrs. Martin.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.938
Lucille does make
a wonderful lamb.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.850
There it is.

32:14.891 --> 32:18.952
Oh, yeah.
l knew l left somebody here.

32:18.996 --> 32:20.987
You call this
handling your liquor?

32:21.031 --> 32:22.521
What? l had two beers.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.193
Four, but who's counting?

32:24.234 --> 32:25.599
Obviously, you are.

32:25.635 --> 32:28.001
So now l'm gonna
sip some scotch.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.096
You have any problems
with that?

32:30.140 --> 32:32.131
No. But you do.

32:33.510 --> 32:35.876
Look, why don't you
just shut up?

32:35.912 --> 32:37.573
Or get out.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.658
Who are you calling?

32:49.693 --> 32:51.024
A friend.

32:55.665 --> 32:57.792
l don't believe you--
you just beeped your dealer.

32:57.834 --> 33:00.530
There's that
observant thing again.

33:00.570 --> 33:03.562
You know...

33:03.607 --> 33:05.768
l wasn't sure
if Brandon and everybody

33:05.809 --> 33:07.572
had the right idea
about this intervention thing.

33:07.611 --> 33:10.774
You know, l thought they
went a little too far.

33:10.814 --> 33:13.248
l even told Brandon
to mind his own business.

33:13.283 --> 33:15.979
So, what do you want, a medal?

33:16.019 --> 33:17.486
Don't do this, Dylan.

33:17.521 --> 33:18.988
You need help.

33:20.490 --> 33:22.549
Don't answer it.

33:23.593 --> 33:25.925
Please?

33:26.963 --> 33:28.590
Hello?

33:28.632 --> 33:31.430
Yeah, chief,
what are you doing?

33:31.468 --> 33:34.460
Yeah, l was out of commission
for a minute, but l'm back.

33:34.504 --> 33:36.802
Listen, hold on.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.468
So, you gonna stay,
you gonna go?

33:40.510 --> 33:42.171
You don't need me.

33:42.212 --> 33:43.679
You have your friends.

33:55.492 --> 33:56.686
Tell me...

33:57.961 --> 34:01.556
Ah! The gang's all here!

34:01.598 --> 34:02.622
Oh, did you guys think
you were going

34:02.666 --> 34:03.826
to get your own private table?

34:05.602 --> 34:07.968
Shut up and move over.

34:08.038 --> 34:10.370
You're so kind to me, Kelly.

34:10.407 --> 34:11.965
Ah! Just like old times.

34:12.074 --> 34:13.303
Us forcing Nat to stay open

34:13.342 --> 34:14.810
when he'd rather
be home in bed.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.972
You know, l keep hearing
about all these ''old times.''

34:17.013 --> 34:19.277
What exactly did you guys do
all night long?

34:19.315 --> 34:21.545
Oh, we used to stuff our faces
with megaburgers!

34:21.585 --> 34:23.177
Willie, fire up the grill.

34:23.219 --> 34:24.277
We got a hungry man over here.

34:24.321 --> 34:26.447
Not for me. lt's a little late.

34:26.489 --> 34:27.980
Aw, come on. You haven't lived

34:28.058 --> 34:29.547
till you've gotten indigestion
from a mega with cheese, pal.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.152
You want anything, hon?

34:32.195 --> 34:33.889
l'll have some hot tea.

34:33.929 --> 34:36.194
Oh, boy, here we go.

34:36.233 --> 34:37.097
What?

34:37.134 --> 34:39.398
Kelly's not eating anymore.

34:39.436 --> 34:42.428
Brandon... do me a favor.

34:42.472 --> 34:43.768
Don't turn into my mother.

34:43.806 --> 34:45.831
All right. lf l hear anything,
l'll let you know.

34:45.876 --> 34:47.867
All right. Bye.

34:52.482 --> 34:55.849
l hate to break this party up,
but l got some terrible news.

34:55.886 --> 34:58.582
Your mother called, Brandon.

34:58.622 --> 35:00.317
lt seems our friend

35:00.357 --> 35:02.757
checked himself out of rehab
this afternoon.

35:02.792 --> 35:06.125
When l'm missing you

35:06.163 --> 35:10.031
Our love, it won't go astray...

35:18.241 --> 35:19.833
Hey.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.241
Hey, man.

35:21.278 --> 35:22.609
How you doing?

35:22.646 --> 35:23.943
You're always there
in the pinch.

35:23.980 --> 35:25.675
Yeah, well, l always will be.

35:25.715 --> 35:27.342
l'm like an old street lamp

35:27.384 --> 35:30.376
turning on every night at 6:00.

35:30.420 --> 35:33.981
So, a little nine ball
to cover the freight there?

35:34.024 --> 35:35.821
No, man. Sorry.

35:35.859 --> 35:39.022
l don't gamble,
except with my life.

35:41.331 --> 35:44.767
You know, man, l got a little
something special tonight.

35:44.801 --> 35:46.962
l don't know if you'd
be interested in it.

35:47.003 --> 35:49.563
What have you got?

35:49.606 --> 35:52.939
You ever chase the dragon?

35:52.976 --> 35:55.342
Heroin?

35:55.378 --> 35:56.367
Yeah, you know,

35:56.413 --> 35:57.937
smoke a little bit
makes coming in

35:57.981 --> 36:01.417
from a snowstorm a lot
easier to take.

36:01.451 --> 36:04.011
How much?

36:06.923 --> 36:08.220
Well, um...

36:08.258 --> 36:11.557
here.

36:11.595 --> 36:14.530
There's a little
sample on me.

36:14.564 --> 36:17.624
Enjoy your pool game.

36:24.541 --> 36:25.906
l've never been so glad

36:25.942 --> 36:27.967
to have a dog to walk
in my life.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.979
Well, we've been around
the block three times.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.776
You going for a record?

36:31.815 --> 36:34.511
No... l just don't want
to go back in there yet.

36:34.551 --> 36:36.280
Well, l can arrange that.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.892
Rocky.

36:44.928 --> 36:46.987
Ray, l'm sorry.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.895
What do you have
to be sorry about?

36:48.932 --> 36:50.456
My parents.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.831
Are you kidding?

36:51.868 --> 36:53.563
They were horrible.

36:53.603 --> 36:55.696
Yeah. l guess l didn't
quite win over your mom, huh?

36:55.739 --> 36:57.764
Kind of liked your dad, though.

36:57.807 --> 37:00.002
He seemed like a smart guy.

37:00.076 --> 37:02.237
Yeah, he's real sweet
when you get to know him.

37:02.279 --> 37:03.576
l think he likes you.

37:03.613 --> 37:06.207
Well, let's not
get carried away.

37:06.249 --> 37:07.944
l think he was
just minding his manners.

37:08.018 --> 37:11.454
Well, you held your ground,
and you were honest.

37:11.488 --> 37:13.217
That means a lot to my dad.

37:13.256 --> 37:15.747
That doesn't matter anyway.

37:15.792 --> 37:17.953
What does that mean?

37:17.994 --> 37:21.953
Well, l'm not going out
with your parents.

37:22.032 --> 37:23.590
l'm going out with you, right?

37:26.136 --> 37:28.263
l figure the only one
l gotta impress

37:28.305 --> 37:30.705
in your family is Rocky ll.

37:30.740 --> 37:32.230
Come here, buddy. Hey.

37:32.275 --> 37:34.436
How am l doing, huh?

37:34.477 --> 37:37.537
l think he likes you.

37:37.580 --> 37:38.638
Oh, Rocky.

37:38.682 --> 37:39.671
Think so?

37:45.922 --> 37:47.446
Hi, guys.

37:47.490 --> 37:48.718
What are you looking for?

37:48.758 --> 37:50.555
A videotape.

37:50.593 --> 37:51.617
Oh, yeah? Which one?

37:51.661 --> 37:54.721
Uh... lt was an old air check

37:54.764 --> 37:56.959
that we kind of taped over.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.093
Which air check?

37:59.135 --> 38:00.796
Why?

38:00.837 --> 38:02.668
Well, if it's the one
we made last month,

38:02.706 --> 38:03.866
l gave it to my parents.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.808
They just wanted to
see what we were doing.

38:06.843 --> 38:09.573
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

38:13.983 --> 38:15.644
Donna.

38:15.685 --> 38:16.879
What are you doing here?

38:16.920 --> 38:19.514
Hi, Mom. Um... l...
l forgot something.

38:19.556 --> 38:21.148
l'll just... l'll
just be a minute.

38:21.191 --> 38:23.682
What's so important
it couldn't wait until morning?

38:23.727 --> 38:24.955
The... the videotape.

38:25.061 --> 38:26.756
Clare and David need it
for their class tomorrow.

38:26.796 --> 38:27.956
Oh, but l want to see it.

38:27.997 --> 38:29.362
Can't we take a quick peek
at it before you go?

38:29.399 --> 38:31.094
No, Mom. Mom, really--
l'm in a hurry.

38:31.134 --> 38:33.898
l'll bring it back.
l promise, okay?

38:33.937 --> 38:36.132
Looking for this?

38:36.172 --> 38:38.663
Hi, Dad.

38:38.708 --> 38:39.868
Yeah. Thanks.

38:39.909 --> 38:41.342
Um, did... did you watch that?

38:41.378 --> 38:43.778
l tried.

38:43.813 --> 38:46.373
All l got was a lot of static.

38:46.416 --> 38:47.610
Oh... huh.

38:47.650 --> 38:48.981
Well, we're going to have
the machine looked at.

38:49.018 --> 38:50.815
Good idea.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.448
Give David my best.

38:58.361 --> 38:59.988
Thanks, Dad.

39:00.063 --> 39:00.995
Mm-hmm.

39:01.064 --> 39:02.088
A lot.

39:02.132 --> 39:07.092
You owe me... big time.

39:07.137 --> 39:09.298
Right.

39:10.774 --> 39:13.106
Donna, l would like
to talk to you.

39:13.143 --> 39:15.634
Mom, could we talk tomorrow?

39:15.678 --> 39:20.547
Look... l know
you don't like Ray.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.210
But l do.

39:22.252 --> 39:24.447
Yeah, but, honey,
what about Griffin?

39:24.487 --> 39:26.751
He... he's such
a nice young man.

39:26.790 --> 39:30.385
Right... yeah, Griffin's
a real gentleman.

39:30.427 --> 39:32.292
He waited till the second
date before he tried

39:32.328 --> 39:34.159
to get me to go
to bed with him.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.688
Sweet dreams, Mom.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.907
So how'd it go?

39:44.941 --> 39:46.135
lt was fine.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.973
l don't want to hear ''fine.''
l want details.

39:48.044 --> 39:49.875
Tell me about the house.

39:49.913 --> 39:51.141
What did it look like?

39:51.181 --> 39:52.205
What did they serve?

39:52.248 --> 39:53.738
lt was great, Mama.

39:53.783 --> 39:55.648
lt was everything
you'd expect, you know?

39:55.685 --> 39:56.674
North of Sunset.

39:56.719 --> 39:57.981
Real silver?

39:58.087 --> 39:59.179
Oh, yeah, yeah.
l checked.

39:59.222 --> 40:00.985
lt was real, all right.
lt was heavy.

40:01.057 --> 40:04.288
-Servants?
-A whole army of 'em.

40:04.327 --> 40:05.555
Every time l turned around,

40:05.595 --> 40:07.722
somebody was picking
something up or putting

40:07.764 --> 40:09.493
something down.

40:09.532 --> 40:11.693
Oh, that must be the life.

40:11.734 --> 40:12.962
What about her parents?

40:13.002 --> 40:14.697
They were great.
They were great.

40:14.737 --> 40:15.704
Real nice to me.

40:15.738 --> 40:18.332
As well they should be.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.365
You be good to this girl.

40:20.410 --> 40:22.742
You let her be good to you.

40:26.182 --> 40:27.308
Good night, Mama.

40:27.350 --> 40:30.786
Good night, baby.

40:34.657 --> 40:36.784
Where you been?

40:36.826 --> 40:39.351
To see a movie.
What's the matter?

40:40.563 --> 40:42.030
Dylan checked himself out
of rehab.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.259
Nobody knows where he is.

40:43.299 --> 40:45.893
You haven't heard
from him, have you?

40:45.935 --> 40:47.994
l said l went to a movie.

40:48.037 --> 40:50.028
l'm sorry.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.973
l thought he might have tried
to call you or something.

40:52.008 --> 40:53.032
Well, he didn't.

40:53.109 --> 40:54.474
Ladies.

40:54.511 --> 40:56.172
All right, all right, all right.

40:56.212 --> 40:59.375
Valerie, we're all
a little on edge here.

40:59.415 --> 41:00.712
We're just worried about him.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.776
Well, maybe it's time
to stop worrying.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.789
l mean, there's only so much
you can do for somebody.

41:06.823 --> 41:08.256
lf he doesn't want your help,

41:08.291 --> 41:09.815
it's his problem,
don't you think?

41:09.859 --> 41:11.918
She's right.

41:11.961 --> 41:14.122
Face it, Dylan's life

41:14.163 --> 41:15.562
is in his own hands now.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.998
And there's nothing
any of us can say or do

41:18.067 --> 41:20.035
that will change that.
