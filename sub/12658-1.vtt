00:40.480 --> 00:46.261
<i>Some chefs call them ''lovebirds, ''
a romantic dish for that special occasion.</i>

00:50.396 --> 00:53.941
<i>Properly cooked,
they're as tender as butter.</i>

00:54.331 --> 00:57.974
<i>They can be roasted,
stuffed with wild rice or barley...</i>

00:58.138 --> 00:59.926
<i>...or you can broil them, poach them...</i>

01:01.305 --> 01:03.093
<i>...barbecue them,
and even braise them.</i>

01:03.289 --> 01:06.419
<i>But there's no greater sin
than to overcook a quail.</i>

01:07.032 --> 01:11.569
<i>Perfectly cooked, it must have
a touch of pink on the breast.</i>

01:11.862 --> 01:15.854
<i>But you need the right quail. It has
to be fleshy or it dries out too easily.</i>

01:16.052 --> 01:17.808
<i>I prefer to serve them roasted.</i>

01:18.228 --> 01:21.260
That makes their taste richer
and more robust.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.825
And a side of truffle ravioli
and wild mushrooms...

01:24.019 --> 01:26.222
...goes deliciously well with them.

01:26.578 --> 01:29.130
Of course, you can also cook
them in a pig's bladder...

01:29.329 --> 01:31.947
...in a mix of Madeira and cognac.

01:32.144 --> 01:36.366
You see, the bladder helps protect
the quail, keeps it moist.

01:36.558 --> 01:40.834
You could serve it with a tender sauce
of thyme, spring onions...

01:41.069 --> 01:43.207
...caramelized shallots, truffles.

01:43.405 --> 01:46.055
<i>Truffles go perfectly
with almost any quail dish...</i>

01:46.251 --> 01:49.120
...because they elevate
the delicate taste.

01:49.994 --> 01:51.520
Are you feeling okay?

01:51.722 --> 01:54.623
l'm fine. Go on.

01:55.752 --> 01:59.100
<i>They wonderfully elevate
the delicate taste of the quail.</i>

01:59.399 --> 02:02.301
But you have to really
be able to afford truffles...

02:02.535 --> 02:05.054
...otherwise you just
better forget about it.

02:05.254 --> 02:08.035
-Now, for a appetizer, l suggest--
-Kate, would you mind...

02:08.229 --> 02:11.643
-...if l change the subject for a moment?
-No.

02:11.844 --> 02:13.731
Why do you come to see me
every week?

02:14.467 --> 02:16.922
My boss said she'd fire me
if l didn't get therapy.

02:17.122 --> 02:20.470
And why do you think
she thinks you need therapy?

02:20.673 --> 02:22.200
Why?

02:22.720 --> 02:24.149
You know what?

02:25.088 --> 02:27.128
l haven't the faintest idea.

02:41.755 --> 02:44.624
Ordering two tasting menus.
Fire two amuse-bouche.

02:44.826 --> 02:48.120
Leah, l need a quail and a Dover sole
for table nine.

02:48.313 --> 02:51.825
l'm still waiting on those beef
tenderloins. Where are they? Pick up!

02:52.119 --> 02:53.941
<i>Terrine, carpaccio.</i>

02:57.015 --> 02:59.502
Excuse me, you should know
Hal Reeves says the lamb...

02:59.701 --> 03:02.766
-...has never been so good before.
-Really? And what would he know?

03:02.996 --> 03:06.443
<i>Kate, the Petersons are here. They
wanna tell you how brilliant you are.</i>

03:06.612 --> 03:09.393
-Brilliant chefs belong in the kitchen.
-At least say hello.

03:09.587 --> 03:11.823
You know they're some
of my best customers.

03:12.018 --> 03:14.919
ln a minute. Just don't cook them
too long, because they get--

03:15.121 --> 03:17.225
<i>-They get tough, l know.
-No, dry. Dry, Leah.</i>

03:17.392 --> 03:18.984
l get tough. Quail get dry.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.863
Kate, l wanna go
over the menu for next week.

03:22.734 --> 03:24.228
Later, okay?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.052
<i>You're a magician, Kate.</i>

03:34.251 --> 03:36.770
And you know my husband sings
your praises constantly.

03:36.938 --> 03:38.693
ln fact, it's hard not to be jealous.

03:38.857 --> 03:41.606
l worship anyone
who can surprise my palate.

03:41.801 --> 03:43.905
lt's always a pleasure
to cook for you both.

03:44.104 --> 03:46.307
-We'll see you next week, right?
-Of course.

03:46.503 --> 03:48.445
-Good night.
-Good night.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.150
Nice to see you.

03:57.348 --> 03:59.289
l'm telling you
it's not cooked properly.

03:59.459 --> 04:01.946
-May l ask what this is about?
-Kate, l'll handle this.

04:02.146 --> 04:03.607
-l take it you're the chef?
-Yes.

04:03.778 --> 04:06.428
<i>-There's something l'd like to show you.
-Don't do this.</i>

04:06.593 --> 04:08.959
My wife's foie gras
hasn't been cooked long enough.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.811
-Excuse me?
-Why don't l bring you...

04:10.975 --> 04:14.138
-...a new appetizer with my compliments?
-lt's cooked just fine.

04:14.335 --> 04:17.529
Nothing to be ashamed of, honey.
Even the best stumble over foie gras.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.759
<i>There's nothing wrong with this.
lt's precisely comme il faut.</i>

04:20.957 --> 04:23.990
<i>-What is that supposed to mean?
-Comme il faut? ''As it should be.''</i>

04:24.155 --> 04:27.503
1 40 degrees in the oven, 80 degrees
water temperature, for 25 minutes...

04:27.675 --> 04:30.969
...not too long, not too short,
with the perfect touch of pink, honey.

04:31.162 --> 04:34.390
<i>That's it.
We'll take our business somewhere else.</i>

04:34.585 --> 04:36.111
Let's go.

04:38.039 --> 04:41.966
May l suggest Vinnie's hot dog stand
at the corner? He cooks to order.

04:43.957 --> 04:45.451
<i>How many times have I told you?</i>

04:45.621 --> 04:48.620
You can't make a scene every time
someone doesn't like your food.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.308
<i>-Please. The guy's a barbarian.
-And a paying customer.</i>

04:51.475 --> 04:53.613
lf he says the foie gras
is not done, it's not.

04:53.843 --> 04:56.231
-Foie gras is cruelty to animals.
-Stay out of this.

04:56.402 --> 05:00.394
l swear to God, if you weren't one of
the better chefs in this city, l'd fire you.

05:00.561 --> 05:03.594
One of the better chefs?
What's that supposed to mean?

05:03.792 --> 05:05.734
l bet she's just saying that
to annoy me.

05:07.279 --> 05:09.864
She's just saying that to annoy me.

05:10.062 --> 05:12.134
-lsn't she?
-Whatever you say, chef.

05:44.483 --> 05:49.054
<i>Mailbox one. You have no messages.</i>

06:04.573 --> 06:06.165
-Hey, how are you?
-l'm good, Frank.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.990
Got some nice lobsters from Maine.

06:08.156 --> 06:10.359
<i>That one's a little too small.
Try this one.</i>

06:10.556 --> 06:13.686
Yeah, yeah. Have them delivered
by 2:30, okay?

06:13.882 --> 06:15.922
And send those scrawny ones
to La Fontaine.

06:16.122 --> 06:18.707
Kate! Who's your best friend?

06:18.937 --> 06:21.238
-You got it?
-Did you ask me to?

06:21.433 --> 06:23.123
Golden tilefish?

06:23.960 --> 06:25.618
-Bob!
-Just for you.

06:25.815 --> 06:29.556
-lt's beautiful.
-Beautiful golden tilefish, line-caught.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.026
-Beautiful.
-Give me a kiss.

06:31.253 --> 06:33.075
-Bob.
-Give me a kiss.

06:33.653 --> 06:37.132
-Hey! Hey! How come l didn't get a kiss?
-How come you didn't get a kiss?

06:37.332 --> 06:38.640
You ain't got the goods.

06:38.835 --> 06:41.038
-What's this?
-l don't see any golden tilefish.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.678
<i>-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.</i>

06:53.870 --> 06:56.771
l'm just checking in.
We should be there about 9.

06:56.942 --> 06:58.851
<i>Great, so I'll make sure
I'm back by then.</i>

06:59.085 --> 07:02.433
Okay, cool. So, what are you doing?
Reading a recipe, right?

07:03.467 --> 07:06.532
Christine, don't be ridiculous.
l do have other interests.

07:06.762 --> 07:08.550
<i>Of course you do. Name one.</i>

07:08.746 --> 07:10.917
<i>-How's Zoe?
-Adorable.</i>

07:11.113 --> 07:14.079
She's changed so much
since you saw her last.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.613
-Haven't you, sweetheart?
-l don't know.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.654
<i>-So, what do you guys want for dinner?
-Don't worry about us.</i>

07:19.878 --> 07:22.844
-We'll just grab a pizza or something.
-l don't think so.

07:23.077 --> 07:25.978
<i>-So, what does Zoe like these days?
-She eats anything.</i>

07:26.181 --> 07:28.547
-She's a vacuum cleaner.
-Mom.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.641
l'll call you when we get closer.
Say bye to your Aunt Kate.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.721
-Bye, Aunt Kate.
-Bye, Aunt Kate.

07:40.032 --> 07:42.781
-Hey, Kate. Did you just get in?
-No, l forgot something.

07:42.975 --> 07:44.436
-How are you?
-Good.

07:44.863 --> 07:47.862
<i>Are you working tonight?
l know this great little Thai place.</i>

07:48.061 --> 07:50.003
Actually, l am.
Just for a couple of hours.

07:50.173 --> 07:52.180
My sister's coming into town
with my niece.

07:52.349 --> 07:54.585
l don't give up that easily.
One of these days...

07:54.748 --> 07:57.169
...l'm gonna convince you
to have dinner with me.

07:57.371 --> 08:01.461
Look, Sean, l think you should know
l don't generally do that.

08:02.457 --> 08:04.845
-What, have dinner?
-Dinner dates.

08:05.081 --> 08:07.415
-How about breakfast?
-You live in my building.

08:07.608 --> 08:11.317
l don't generally go out with people
in my building. As a rule.

08:12.151 --> 08:13.841
You seem to have a lot of rules.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.913
Didn't you say you forgot something?

08:21.140 --> 08:23.376
-Oh, thanks. Right.
-You're welcome.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.405
<i>So, what's the problem
with having rules?</i>

08:39.438 --> 08:41.445
lt's not as if l'm controlling
or anything.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.750
l just prefer things
to be done exactly right.

08:43.948 --> 08:46.730
<i>That's why l usually end up
doing everything myself.</i>

08:46.924 --> 08:51.592
Do you have any idea how complicated
it is to coordinate 40 dishes at once?

08:52.170 --> 08:53.992
l hope you like scallops.

08:54.762 --> 08:57.543
l thought we agreed you
weren't gonna cook for me anymore.

08:57.768 --> 09:00.996
l didn't cook it for you,
l just tried some new ideas.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.199
Who else am l gonna give it to?

09:05.031 --> 09:07.135
Now, we're gonna try
something new this week.

09:07.525 --> 09:11.834
l'm going to ask you questions,
and you're gonna answer them.

09:12.036 --> 09:15.745
How long ago
was your last relationship?

09:17.314 --> 09:19.452
lsn't that a little personal?

09:19.682 --> 09:21.111
Well, this is therapy.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.189
How long?

09:24.065 --> 09:26.453
l don't know.Three years ago.
Maybe four.

09:26.656 --> 09:29.176
-Who ended it?
-l did.

09:29.407 --> 09:32.505
-He was getting way too demanding.
-How so?

09:32.990 --> 09:37.364
Well, if you must know, after two years
he wanted to move in together.

09:37.597 --> 09:40.313
Did you try the saffron sauce?

09:40.507 --> 09:43.736
And, l'm sorry, what's so bad
about moving in together?

09:44.315 --> 09:47.063
He asked me to give up
my apartment.

09:47.258 --> 09:49.013
Why would l wanna do that?

09:49.177 --> 09:51.086
l'd move out,
we'd get a place together...

09:51.289 --> 09:54.070
...he'd eventually leave,
then where would l be?

09:54.264 --> 09:55.889
My God.

09:56.662 --> 10:00.971
<i>-The sauce is so good.
-Thank you.</i>

10:04.373 --> 10:07.601
-Where's my lobster for table 1 2?
-Plating, chef.

10:07.827 --> 10:10.761
l'm an actress
and l don't do naked bondage movies.

10:10.962 --> 10:14.539
<i>The world is so full of pervs.
That guy at table 1 0 is the worst.</i>

10:14.738 --> 10:16.363
Every week a new bimbo.

10:16.561 --> 10:20.651
l swear, he leers at my tits
one more time, he's gonna regret it.

10:22.735 --> 10:24.643
Damn it, Carlos!
Watch where you're going.

10:24.847 --> 10:26.635
-Pay attention, everybody.
-Sorry, chef.

10:26.798 --> 10:28.586
Fire two lobsters right away.
Hold the nine.

10:28.749 --> 10:31.715
-l'm really sorry about that.
-Just don't let it happen again.

10:31.917 --> 10:34.534
Now you're gonna run out of lobster
right after l leave.

10:34.699 --> 10:38.888
Kate, we're not gonna run out
of anything, we're fine. Hydrate.

10:39.082 --> 10:40.511
You're a mom already.

10:40.713 --> 10:42.884
Well, l've gotta practice
while l can, right?

10:43.081 --> 10:44.739
<i>-Thanks.
-Thank you.</i>

10:48.999 --> 10:50.787
Someone get the phone.

10:52.774 --> 10:55.326
-Kitchen.
-lf it's my sister, tell her she said 9...

10:55.525 --> 10:57.085
...can't make it any sooner.

10:58.437 --> 11:00.770
<i>-lt's for you.
-Take a message.</i>

11:00.963 --> 11:02.239
Kate...

11:03.011 --> 11:04.701
...l think you better take this.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.248
-Hello.
-One's done.

11:09.441 --> 11:11.197
Speaking.

11:49.301 --> 11:52.878
Ms. Armstrong? l'm Dr. Burton.
We spoke on the phone.

11:53.076 --> 11:56.784
Zoe's doing great.
She's gonna be fine.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.216
Has anyone told her yet?

11:59.409 --> 12:02.954
We thought it would be best for her
to hear it from someone in the family.

12:03.152 --> 12:05.540
Do you know how
we can reach Zoe's father?

12:06.256 --> 12:08.110
He's never been....

12:09.487 --> 12:10.893
l don't even know his name.

12:11.054 --> 12:14.053
<i>Dr. Burton to Emergency, please.
Paging Dr. Burton....</i>

12:14.221 --> 12:16.009
l'm so sorry.

12:16.973 --> 12:20.932
l have to go, but l'll be back to check
on her in just a little bit, okay?

12:44.259 --> 12:45.666
Hello, Zoe.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.480
Where's Mom?

12:51.778 --> 12:53.207
ls she dead?

12:56.481 --> 12:58.553
She is, isn't she?

13:01.919 --> 13:03.445
Yes.

13:27.159 --> 13:30.540
<i>You have one new message.</i>

13:31.445 --> 13:33.452
<i>-Hi, it's me.
-And me!</i>

13:33.653 --> 13:35.693
<i>We just wanted you to know
we're running late.</i>

13:35.925 --> 13:39.219
<i>Traffic's insane.
We'll get there eventually. Bye.</i>

13:39.699 --> 13:41.357
<i>End of messages.</i>

13:49.361 --> 13:53.451
Now, this is a beautiful
2002 Dolcetto.

13:53.679 --> 13:55.271
Any idea where it might be from?

13:55.471 --> 13:58.470
-Probably Piedmont.
-South Australia. Adelaide Hills.

13:58.669 --> 14:02.530
lf Kate doesn't find a replacement soon,
l'll have this baby behind the stove.

14:02.732 --> 14:05.033
l think that would be
a health-code violation.

14:05.227 --> 14:08.739
Bernadette. Look at the color
of this wine. lt's absolutely beautiful.

14:08.938 --> 14:10.792
And it's ready to drink....

14:17.832 --> 14:21.213
<i>Give me three words
to describe this wine. Three words.</i>

14:21.414 --> 14:23.356
Did you know she was coming in?

14:27.204 --> 14:29.091
Kate, what are you doing?

14:29.316 --> 14:30.560
What do you mean?

14:30.787 --> 14:33.242
l thought you were gonna take
a few days off.

14:33.507 --> 14:35.808
-No.
-Are you sure?

14:36.642 --> 14:37.984
Yeah.

14:40.609 --> 14:43.357
Give me one duck, two beef rare,
and a rack of lamb.

14:43.584 --> 14:46.004
l'm still waiting
on those tenderloins of beef.

14:46.207 --> 14:47.417
Pick up.

14:47.583 --> 14:50.778
l need a quail and a Dover sole
for table nine. Okay, let's go, guys.

14:51.486 --> 14:54.387
<i>Come on, let's move it.
Terrine, carpaccio.</i>

14:54.621 --> 14:56.409
Carlos, l need more pans, pronto.

14:56.603 --> 14:59.602
-Five minutes on the lobster.
-Cleanup right away on table 1 3.

14:59.771 --> 15:02.291
Fire one rare steak on the fly.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.390
<i>Two duck breast, two rack of lamb.
Let's go, people.</i>

15:05.593 --> 15:08.788
Why is there no food on the counter?
Come on, we got tables!

15:10.104 --> 15:12.078
<i>Where's my souffle for 1 4?</i>

15:18.133 --> 15:21.394
<i>Dear Kate, the baby is gorgeous.</i>

15:22.644 --> 15:26.026
<i>I've called her Zoe,
which means ''life. ''</i>

15:26.450 --> 15:29.035
<i>Now she's here, I'm beginning
to get what a huge thing...</i>

15:29.234 --> 15:30.989
<i>...it is I'm doing on my own.</i>

15:31.217 --> 15:34.631
<i>So I want you to know
if anything should ever happen to me...</i>

15:34.833 --> 15:38.127
<i>...you are the only person
I would want to have her.</i>

15:38.415 --> 15:42.189
<i>I know you'll love my baby
the same way I would.</i>

15:42.382 --> 15:46.123
<i>Listen to me,
it must be the three-day blues.</i>

15:46.477 --> 15:49.640
<i>I love you, sis. Christine.</i>

16:03.783 --> 16:05.027
Kate...

16:06.726 --> 16:09.060
...l want you to take a week off.

16:09.541 --> 16:12.475
<i>That's not a suggestion, it's an order.</i>

16:23.874 --> 16:25.564
<i>What's up, Doc?</i>

16:25.793 --> 16:30.134
<i>Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Wile E. Coyote, genius.</i>

16:30.303 --> 16:31.480
Hello, Zoe.

16:31.679 --> 16:34.580
<i>I'm sorry, Mac, the lady of the house
ain't home and besides...</i>

16:34.782 --> 16:36.822
<i>...we mailed your refund check
last week.</i>

16:37.149 --> 16:39.004
l cooked us something tasty.

16:39.485 --> 16:40.979
l'm not hungry.

16:42.171 --> 16:43.731
Okay.

16:53.369 --> 16:56.499
You know, you can leave on Friday.
You know that?

16:56.695 --> 16:58.124
Yes.

17:04.213 --> 17:07.376
Zoe, you and l have to talk
about what's gonna happen.

17:07.796 --> 17:09.137
Can l go back home?

17:10.898 --> 17:12.721
l'm afraid not.

17:13.329 --> 17:14.890
Why not?

17:16.593 --> 17:18.960
Well, you'd be alone there.

17:21.104 --> 17:23.242
Your mom asked me
to take care of you.

17:24.815 --> 17:26.569
So you'll be coming home
with me, okay?

18:01.123 --> 18:03.937
So the kitchen
is just to the right there.

18:04.771 --> 18:06.112
<i>The living room.</i>

18:08.226 --> 18:11.040
<i>This is my bedroom and the bathroom.</i>

18:12.704 --> 18:13.980
<i>This will be your bedroom.</i>

18:47.478 --> 18:50.706
<i>We'll have sunshine today.
It's cold, a high of 36.</i>

18:53.907 --> 18:57.801
Her name is Nelly. l've had her
since l was 3. She has a whole family.

18:58.866 --> 19:01.287
You should see all my other animals.

19:05.969 --> 19:08.335
Zoe, dinner's ready!

19:08.527 --> 19:09.901
Okay.

19:14.861 --> 19:15.973
<i>Bon appetit.</i>

19:22.603 --> 19:23.879
Everything all right?

19:25.418 --> 19:28.483
What's the matter?
Aren't you hungry?

19:30.441 --> 19:32.229
Can l go back to my room?

19:33.640 --> 19:34.785
Sure.

19:49.187 --> 19:52.056
Zoe, l have to stop by the restaurant
for a couple of minutes.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.710
Will you be okay here on your own
for a little while?

19:54.881 --> 19:56.506
-Yes.
-Now, if you need me...

19:56.705 --> 20:01.013
...just press one, that's my cell phone,
and two, that's the restaurant, okay?

20:01.247 --> 20:05.108
lt's only a few blocks away, so if you
need me l can be back here in no time.

20:05.310 --> 20:07.863
-All right?
-Okay.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.099
l won't be long.

20:45.266 --> 20:46.760
Hi, Kate.

20:52.368 --> 20:54.538
He says, ''Look! Look at the stars!

20:55.119 --> 20:58.118
Gaze at the stars which tremble
with love.''

20:58.350 --> 20:59.943
Hello, chef.

21:01.005 --> 21:02.434
Oh, my God, it's you.

21:03.020 --> 21:06.532
l am begging you, will you please tell me
the secret of your saffron sauce?

21:07.371 --> 21:08.615
Excuse me?

21:09.803 --> 21:12.191
Listen to this, guys.
Listen to this right here.

21:13.417 --> 21:14.911
Listen.

21:15.657 --> 21:19.398
He's saying, ''Fade the stars,
fade all the stars.''

21:25.637 --> 21:27.459
So you guys are my string section.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.979
He says, ''ln the morning
l am going to wake.''

21:34.339 --> 21:36.193
<i>''This is our love.''</i>

21:38.402 --> 21:40.922
Now, everybody. ''Win our love.''

21:55.613 --> 21:58.645
All right, all right. Back to work!

22:00.891 --> 22:02.712
Who do you think you are?

22:03.802 --> 22:05.427
Nicholas Palmer.

22:05.657 --> 22:10.228
And may l just say the world
would be a dark and depressing place...

22:10.456 --> 22:12.757
...without your quail in truffle sauce.

22:14.871 --> 22:16.300
We need to talk.

22:17.686 --> 22:20.467
-You could've at least asked me.
-l'm sorry. l couldn't wait.

22:20.661 --> 22:23.278
Nick became available.
l had to act quickly.

22:23.444 --> 22:26.313
<i>The last thing l need right now
is some lunatic in my kitchen.</i>

22:26.515 --> 22:30.060
He's not a lunatic. He's exuberant. God
knows we could use that around here.

22:30.226 --> 22:33.389
<i>Exuberant? Are you kidding me?
The guy thinks he's Pavarotti.</i>

22:33.585 --> 22:35.472
Good evening.
Do you have a reservation?

22:35.664 --> 22:37.835
-Yes, Matthews.
-Matthews. Yes.

22:38.032 --> 22:40.071
May l take your coats, please?

22:41.519 --> 22:44.813
Let me show you to your table.
Excuse me.

22:46.509 --> 22:48.166
Your waiter will be right over.

22:48.365 --> 22:50.731
<i>The only demand l had
when l took this position...</i>

22:50.892 --> 22:52.714
...was l get to choose
who l work with.

22:52.907 --> 22:56.005
-Leah would have been just fine.
-Leah can barely stand up anymore.

22:56.170 --> 22:58.439
lf l push her, she's gonna fall over.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.851
Holding her crotch and chopping
at the same time! Give him a chance.

23:07.015 --> 23:09.086
-Nick is excellent.
-l know nothing about him.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.261
-l have no idea what--
-Give me some credit.

23:11.430 --> 23:13.884
<i>-He was the sous-chef at ll Treviso.
-ltalian?</i>

23:14.084 --> 23:18.207
You bring a sous-chef from an ltalian
restaurant, and l'm the one in therapy?

23:18.724 --> 23:21.592
We were lucky to get him.
Peninsula offered him executive chef.

23:21.826 --> 23:22.906
Why didn't he take it?

23:23.106 --> 23:25.593
Because he said he wanted
to work with you.

24:05.621 --> 24:06.930
Zoe.

24:14.514 --> 24:18.158
<i>Funny thing to me about being in these
cabs is when you're in Manhattan...</i>

24:18.353 --> 24:21.833
<i>...for some reason you don't get scared
no matter how fast you're going.</i>

24:22.032 --> 24:26.984
<i>Well, you know, he's driving fast
and recklessly. He's a professional.</i>

24:28.206 --> 24:31.554
<i>He's got a cab-driver's license,
I can see it right there.</i>

24:31.725 --> 24:34.593
<i>I don't even know what it takes
to get a cab-driver's license.</i>

24:34.796 --> 24:36.868
<i>I think all you need is a face.</i>

24:38.731 --> 24:41.480
<i>This seems to be
their big qualification.</i>

24:41.674 --> 24:44.989
<i>No blank heads are allowed
driving cabs in this town.</i>

25:51.925 --> 25:55.121
Kate, wake up.

25:57.684 --> 25:59.090
Kate.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.646
School starts at 9.

26:03.282 --> 26:04.710
lt's 8:20.

26:11.471 --> 26:13.129
Oh, no.

26:13.743 --> 26:17.833
Oh, jeez. Okay, let's get dressed,
come on. Oh, you're dressed.

26:18.061 --> 26:19.686
Okay, okay, one minute.

26:20.684 --> 26:23.618
Do you need supplies or anything?
Like pens or paper?

26:23.851 --> 26:25.476
<i>They usually have those things.</i>

26:26.506 --> 26:30.564
l made your lunch yesterday.
l hope you like duck.

26:32.361 --> 26:33.887
Okay, come on! Let's go.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.021
-l can't find my scarf.
-Don't worry about it.

26:37.255 --> 26:40.069
l can't have you late for your
first day of school. Let's go.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.401
-l need my scarf.
-Zoe, just use one of mine.

26:42.597 --> 26:44.506
We'll find yours later, all right?

26:47.588 --> 26:49.497
Let's go find your scarf.

26:54.786 --> 26:56.509
Here it is.

26:59.457 --> 27:01.114
ls this it?

27:06.942 --> 27:09.690
<i>-That's it.
-Great.</i>

27:10.781 --> 27:11.925
<i>That was easy.</i>

27:13.372 --> 27:14.549
Let's go.

27:16.827 --> 27:18.518
Okay.

27:20.378 --> 27:21.938
Your lunch.

27:23.449 --> 27:25.238
Could you get that, please?

27:31.415 --> 27:32.821
Why didn't you get the door?

27:33.014 --> 27:35.380
l'm not supposed to answer
the door for strangers.

27:35.574 --> 27:38.442
Right. Yeah, that's smart.

27:38.676 --> 27:40.650
-Hi, Sean.
-Any chance for some coffee?

27:40.852 --> 27:43.851
-l've just run out.
-Sure. We're running a little late but--

27:44.051 --> 27:46.058
Just one second.

27:46.258 --> 27:49.356
Good morning. l'm Sean.
l live downstairs.

27:50.801 --> 27:52.458
You must be Kate's niece.

27:53.424 --> 27:54.634
Zoe, right?

28:01.645 --> 28:03.401
My kids are about your age.

28:04.717 --> 28:08.164
<i>They'll be staying with me this weekend.
Are you gonna be around?</i>

28:10.730 --> 28:11.875
Here you go.

28:12.074 --> 28:13.699
<i>-Thanks.
-You're welcome.</i>

28:13.898 --> 28:15.653
<i>-The good stuff.
-Yeah.</i>

28:16.329 --> 28:19.328
All right, let's go.

28:19.656 --> 28:20.638
Quickly.

28:20.808 --> 28:22.717
<i>Thank you
for the Thai noodles last night.</i>

28:22.887 --> 28:24.512
<i>-No problem.
-That was really nice.</i>

28:35.363 --> 28:39.039
-l guess this is where you go in, right?
-l don't know.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.600
Right. Come on.

28:47.711 --> 28:49.336
lt's gonna be fine.

28:49.567 --> 28:52.185
Ms. Armstrong?
l'm Ellen Parker, the principal.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.040
-Kate.
-You must be Zoe.

28:54.237 --> 28:55.928
-Very nice to meet you.
-Hello.

28:56.125 --> 28:59.288
l'll take you to the classroom
and we'll meet your teacher.

29:04.122 --> 29:06.260
<i>There has to be someone
better suited for this.</i>

29:06.874 --> 29:10.931
l have no idea what to do with a kid,
especially one who's lost her mother.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.102
How do their minds work?

29:13.304 --> 29:16.085
l can't get Zoe to eat anything l make.

29:16.279 --> 29:20.434
-What am l supposed to do, force her?
-Maybe she misses her mother's cooking.

29:20.630 --> 29:22.517
My sister never cooked.

29:23.380 --> 29:25.584
-She reheated.
-Well, that's the point.

29:25.780 --> 29:30.994
Maybe Zoe needs something
more familiar, less sophisticated.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.909
What did you eat
when you were a kid?

29:33.425 --> 29:36.523
-lt's not the same.
-What do you mean?

29:37.264 --> 29:38.987
My mother was an amazing cook.

29:39.184 --> 29:41.419
Of course, l was the only one
who appreciated it.

29:41.615 --> 29:45.770
And after your mother passed away,
did your father take over the cooking?

29:45.934 --> 29:49.316
No. He didn't take over anything.

29:50.285 --> 29:53.066
We were lucky if we even saw him
at dinner.

29:53.579 --> 29:57.888
-So who took care of the two of you?
-Can we not get into this right now?

29:58.730 --> 30:00.223
Okay.

30:02.697 --> 30:05.314
What about fish sticks?
Kids love them.

30:06.344 --> 30:08.099
Fish sticks?

30:08.263 --> 30:10.401
Yeah, you know, they're frozen
and breaded--

30:10.566 --> 30:12.354
l know what fish sticks are.

30:13.414 --> 30:16.195
l just can't believe l'm paying
for these suggestions.

30:17.860 --> 30:19.322
Fish sticks.

30:38.334 --> 30:42.162
-Did you learn anything interesting?
-No.

30:43.804 --> 30:47.349
-Anything uninteresting?
-No.

30:48.475 --> 30:50.231
-How was your teacher?
-Bald.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.397
Well, that's interesting.

30:56.953 --> 30:58.774
Fish sticks.

30:59.447 --> 31:03.636
You know, l was thinking the other day,
l know so little about you.

31:03.831 --> 31:07.888
l mean, we're family, but l don't
even know what your favorite color is.

31:08.085 --> 31:12.240
-Red.
-Red? See, l didn't know that.

31:12.435 --> 31:15.434
l love red. Red's a great color.

31:17.234 --> 31:20.910
-What's your favorite number?
-You know, you don't have to do this.

31:22.384 --> 31:23.464
Do what?

31:24.336 --> 31:25.546
<i>Try so hard.</i>

31:33.261 --> 31:34.755
Coming!

31:36.684 --> 31:38.178
Hi, l'm Charlotte.

31:40.427 --> 31:44.135
-From the agency?
-You expecting another Charlotte?

31:48.744 --> 31:49.759
No.

31:53.575 --> 31:55.135
So can l come in or what?

31:55.782 --> 31:57.920
Oh, sure. Come on in.

32:02.532 --> 32:04.386
Excuse me one second.

32:07.619 --> 32:10.520
l told you, l don't need a babysitter.
l'm not a baby anymore.

32:10.754 --> 32:13.655
So, what am l supposed to do?
l can't leave you here alone.

32:13.825 --> 32:15.254
Why not? l'm perfectly fine.

32:15.424 --> 32:18.042
Zoe, you barricaded the door,
remember?

32:18.624 --> 32:21.208
l charge from when l get here,
you know.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.999
Yeah.

32:23.230 --> 32:25.531
l see you've brought
something to read to Zoe.

32:25.725 --> 32:26.969
lt's for my thesis.

32:27.165 --> 32:31.768
Rapidly mutating deadly viruses.
You know, like Ebola, that sort of thing.

32:36.442 --> 32:39.256
Well, have fun at work.

32:41.817 --> 32:44.205
22 Bleecker, can l help you?

32:45.367 --> 32:48.781
<i>Table for five?
Yes, l can seat you at 9.</i>

32:49.014 --> 32:51.631
-l know.
-Yes.

32:54.069 --> 32:56.239
How do you want the sea bass
prepared tonight?

32:56.436 --> 32:59.730
<i>Tell them they're gonna be served
to some very important people.</i>

33:03.922 --> 33:06.954
-You don't like music?
-lt's distracting my staff.

33:07.153 --> 33:10.861
Nick, you were right.
Pavarotti makes sex so much better.

33:11.087 --> 33:15.341
Glad to hear it. Bocelli's good too,
but only for shallow one-night stands.

33:18.925 --> 33:20.834
Pronto. Food. Belly. Now.

33:22.252 --> 33:24.226
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

33:26.027 --> 33:30.019
Me plus baby
equals extra large portions, please.

33:33.673 --> 33:36.421
Bernadette. Bernadette.

33:36.744 --> 33:37.790
<i>That's it.</i>

33:39.079 --> 33:42.144
David, Richard.
lt's gonna be, l think, all men.

33:42.662 --> 33:43.971
l think l can handle it.

33:44.198 --> 33:45.310
Good luck.

33:45.509 --> 33:46.818
John.

33:48.068 --> 33:50.817
-Chef.
-No, thank you.

33:51.075 --> 33:52.503
Delicious, chef.

33:56.418 --> 33:59.766
Only a full cook can judge food.
When you're hungry, everything tastes...

33:59.968 --> 34:02.967
-...better than it really is.
-l never eat in the afternoon.

34:13.500 --> 34:18.201
My grandmother whispered this recipe
into my ear on her deathbed.

34:18.427 --> 34:23.859
She brought it over from the Old Country
and l made it especially for you today.

34:38.324 --> 34:40.659
-Happy?
-Very happy.

34:44.435 --> 34:46.955
l thought your grandmother
lived in Miami.

34:47.474 --> 34:48.967
Well, you know....

34:50.897 --> 34:55.369
Well, we all thought she wasn't
gonna make it. lt was like a miracle.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.779
lt was a miracle.

35:06.252 --> 35:08.902
You take care of those dishes
and l'll take care of these.

35:09.132 --> 35:12.873
<i>-Then we won't get in each other's way.
-Wait, your half is bigger than mine.</i>

35:13.099 --> 35:14.625
Right, right, right.

35:14.826 --> 35:16.319
l have some very big items.

35:16.522 --> 35:20.099
l got beef, l got fish, l got rabbit.

35:20.328 --> 35:22.466
Showtime, folks! Let's go.

35:27.430 --> 35:30.593
Fifteen, two terrines,
one Dover sole, two lamb.

35:30.789 --> 35:33.057
Seven, carpaccio.

35:34.756 --> 35:36.828
-Have you seasoned that right?
-Yes, chef.

35:41.762 --> 35:42.906
lt's okay.

36:03.835 --> 36:07.827
-Okay, where am l? Where's my lamb?
-Slicing it now.

36:08.506 --> 36:10.066
One second. One second.

36:47.086 --> 36:48.296
-Pardon me.
-l need that.

36:48.462 --> 36:50.054
And you'll get it right back.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.179
-Can l ask you something?
-Do l have a choice?

36:59.498 --> 37:01.407
Where did you learn to cook so well?

37:03.401 --> 37:04.611
My mother.

37:04.777 --> 37:07.231
Seriously? l thought
you were gonna say you studied...

37:07.400 --> 37:09.788
...under Alain Passard at L'Arpege
or something.

37:10.791 --> 37:14.718
l did. But my mom was better,
and she didn't throw plates at me.

37:27.554 --> 37:31.033
Oh, God. l need more space.

37:40.126 --> 37:42.264
-Why are you so mad at me?
-l'm not mad at you.

37:43.197 --> 37:44.603
You're very mad.

37:44.796 --> 37:47.959
Look, this is my kitchen.
l've worked really hard to get here...

37:48.156 --> 37:50.522
...and l'm not gonna let you
take it away from me.

37:52.314 --> 37:54.223
What makes you think
l wanna take it away?

37:54.426 --> 37:56.662
What else could you possibly want?

37:59.384 --> 38:01.173
<i>You treat me like a dog, Larry.</i>

38:01.463 --> 38:05.772
l'm not a dog. l'm a human being!
A human being, goddamn--

38:06.326 --> 38:08.594
l'm sorry, l have an audition.

38:08.789 --> 38:10.250
Would you mind?

38:24.816 --> 38:27.947
Look, l don't need this job.
l can work wherever l want.

38:28.143 --> 38:31.852
l'd like to work here because
it's an honor to cook with you...

38:32.046 --> 38:34.762
...but l'd rather work
somewhere l'm welcome.

38:34.990 --> 38:38.665
So if you want me to go,
you just say the word.

38:40.811 --> 38:43.047
Want to tell me
what's going on in here?

38:43.754 --> 38:45.063
Well?

38:48.809 --> 38:50.696
Wait a minute, where are you going?

38:50.856 --> 38:52.863
l'm sorry,
you'll have to find someone else.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.681
-Kate, what have you done?
-l didn't do anything.

38:56.774 --> 38:59.043
Nick, please. We need you.

38:59.238 --> 39:01.441
Well, l'll have to hear that from her.

39:01.733 --> 39:03.423
lt's my restaurant.

39:03.621 --> 39:06.173
lt may be your restaurant, Paula,
but it's her kitchen.

39:06.787 --> 39:08.413
Without her...

39:09.123 --> 39:13.246
...all this would just be a pile
of hot metal and dirty dishes, so....

39:14.113 --> 39:15.673
She decides.

39:16.416 --> 39:17.757
Kate.

39:24.254 --> 39:25.912
Seems you've left me no choice.

39:27.325 --> 39:30.772
-Do you want me to stay?
-Didn't l just say that?

39:32.283 --> 39:33.592
l didn't hear those words.

39:34.971 --> 39:37.839
l want you to stay.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.074
<i>Love to. Thought you'd never ask.</i>

39:43.192 --> 39:44.882
You're on fire.

40:19.278 --> 40:23.019
And l know you guys are scared,
but it's okay, because l'm here.

40:23.212 --> 40:27.586
But if you get really scared, you can
wake me up and l'll hold your hand.

40:27.786 --> 40:30.688
Especially you, Louie,
because you're the littlest.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.199
Zoe?

40:32.778 --> 40:34.206
Hi.

40:36.904 --> 40:39.107
When did Charlotte leave?

40:39.303 --> 40:41.691
l don't know. A while ago.

40:47.301 --> 40:49.275
Looks so cozy in there.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.057
l have an idea.

41:01.825 --> 41:06.875
How about you come with me
to the restaurant tomorrow night?

41:17.404 --> 41:18.832
Night.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.887
Night.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.062
Please.

42:03.726 --> 42:07.914
l've tried everything. No matter
what l make, she doesn't eat it.

42:08.108 --> 42:10.693
Why not try giving her
some regular kid food?

42:11.276 --> 42:13.730
Have you been talking to my therapist?

42:17.769 --> 42:22.656
All right, two foie gras, one tartare,
two bisque and a goat cheese.

42:36.068 --> 42:37.497
Breathe in.

42:39.363 --> 42:40.410
<i>lt's basilico.</i>

42:56.350 --> 43:00.691
Kate. Kate, your biggest fans
are dying to see you.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.061
Leah, finish the duck on table five?
l gotta take a break.

43:11.257 --> 43:12.664
Yeah, sure.

43:26.933 --> 43:31.568
All right, l need one terrine, two bisque
and a langoustine, please.

43:40.433 --> 43:41.512
Good.

43:45.135 --> 43:47.785
<i>Table 1 2's getting a little antsy.
Will it be up soon?</i>

43:49.518 --> 43:50.762
Hold this.

44:00.042 --> 44:02.725
<i>Fire one duck,
one sea bass and a souffle, please.</i>

44:14.023 --> 44:15.615
lt's working now, chef.

44:16.038 --> 44:18.907
<i>Table five's coming up
in a few seconds, chef.</i>

44:19.684 --> 44:21.145
Save some for me.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.641
You know, in ancient Rome...

44:25.187 --> 44:28.569
...guys used to chew basil
before the prom to get rid of bad breath.

44:29.185 --> 44:30.494
lt's true.

44:47.132 --> 44:48.310
<i>Thank you.</i>

44:52.283 --> 44:56.689
<i>-They didn't have proms in ancient Rome.
-They didn't? Are you sure?</i>

44:59.417 --> 45:01.009
l thought they did.

45:09.589 --> 45:12.370
<i>-See you tomorrow.
-Thanks, Leah.</i>

45:31.439 --> 45:33.675
-Good night.
-Good night.

46:22.047 --> 46:23.869
Where are you going?

46:32.668 --> 46:35.188
-Hi, Bob.
-Hi, Kate. How you doing?

46:35.387 --> 46:37.362
-Good. What you got?
-l got fresh bluefin.

46:37.563 --> 46:41.239
Just came in like five minutes ago.
l got baby mollusks over there.

46:41.433 --> 46:43.221
What's behind you there?

46:43.417 --> 46:45.937
-Colorados.
-Yeah, l'm gonna take some of those.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.470
Unbelievably fresh. Look at this.

46:54.261 --> 46:56.911
<i>Good morning, it's 24 degrees,
sunny at 9:00...</i>

46:57.109 --> 46:59.213
<i>...on this Tuesday, February 28th.</i>

47:02.739 --> 47:04.200
Zoe.

47:04.371 --> 47:05.712
Zoe. Zoe. Zoe.

47:05.874 --> 47:07.150
Wake up.

47:07.314 --> 47:11.175
You're gonna be late for school. Here are
your boots. Come on. Let's go, let's go.

47:15.471 --> 47:17.859
Just tell them it was my fault, okay?

47:27.820 --> 47:31.015
Ladies, you are very lucky today.
l have new shipment.

47:31.211 --> 47:35.170
<i>They are from all over the place.
Modena, Montferrato, Bologna.</i>

47:35.369 --> 47:37.888
Big sniff.
lt's a black truffle from Parma.

47:38.089 --> 47:39.266
lt's not bad.

47:40.583 --> 47:43.616
-What do you have in white?
-My best product.

47:43.814 --> 47:46.945
Very, very hard
to find this time of year.

47:50.437 --> 47:53.752
-Who'd you get them from?
-You know l never reveal my sources.

47:54.179 --> 47:56.732
<i>-So how much for the white?
-Twenty-two hundred a pound.</i>

47:56.930 --> 47:59.296
<i>-Oh, my God.
-They are from Alba.</i>

47:59.490 --> 48:02.042
No, no, no.
l think my water just broke.

48:02.241 --> 48:04.607
-What? You're kidding me.
-No, l'm not kidding you.

48:04.768 --> 48:07.484
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-l don't know.

48:07.680 --> 48:09.981
-Can you call 91 1 ?
-No, no, no. No police.

48:10.174 --> 48:13.522
lt's not the police. We need
an ambulance, she's having a baby.

48:13.726 --> 48:16.507
Oh, my God.
Okay, just keep relaxed.

48:16.732 --> 48:19.187
We have pregnant lady,
Bleecker and Charles.

48:19.388 --> 48:22.070
22 Bleecker Street.
Her water just broke.

48:22.267 --> 48:25.201
-22 Bleecker on the corner of Charles.
-Bernadette!

48:25.402 --> 48:27.027
Okay, thank you.

48:27.257 --> 48:29.112
Breathe, yes.

48:32.343 --> 48:33.685
Breathe.

48:49.907 --> 48:51.335
Oh, no!

48:58.928 --> 49:03.334
Just on the left. You see the steps?
Here. Stop! Stop! Just wait.

49:09.709 --> 49:10.985
Oh, Zoe.

49:12.236 --> 49:14.145
-l'm so sorry.
-You forgot me.

49:14.347 --> 49:16.583
-lt's not what you think.
-You forgot me.

49:16.779 --> 49:19.167
Leah had her baby,
l had to take her to the hospital.

49:19.369 --> 49:20.776
But you still forgot me.

49:21.545 --> 49:24.446
Okay, l forgot you.

49:25.256 --> 49:26.270
And l'm so sorry.

49:29.062 --> 49:32.095
Come on, Zoe. Let's go home.

49:34.053 --> 49:36.387
Zoe, come on, it's freezing out here.

49:37.540 --> 49:39.711
Zoe. Move it!

50:16.408 --> 50:19.790
Zoe, l'm sorry. l totally blew it.

50:20.024 --> 50:21.932
l know l'm doing everything wrong.

50:23.446 --> 50:25.812
But l'm doing my best, okay?

50:32.148 --> 50:35.562
Why don't you think of something
l can do to make it up to you?

50:38.065 --> 50:40.269
You mean like a wish?

50:40.657 --> 50:41.900
Yeah.

50:42.320 --> 50:45.548
Yeah, you wish for something
and l try and make it happen.

50:45.743 --> 50:49.571
And in return, you forgive me.

50:54.573 --> 50:57.387
-Can l save it for later?
-Sure.

51:02.859 --> 51:04.167
Kate...

51:05.322 --> 51:07.328
...you're not doing everything wrong.

52:00.089 --> 52:01.616
Really expensive.

52:06.551 --> 52:10.511
All over the kitchen, everybody knows
about it. Carrots are a different matter.

52:37.389 --> 52:39.756
Here you go. How many left?

53:12.099 --> 53:13.659
-Kate?
-Yeah?

53:14.722 --> 53:17.209
-You're not working tomorrow, are you?
-Nope.

53:17.793 --> 53:20.826
And Nick
isn't working tomorrow, is he?

53:21.984 --> 53:23.412
Sunday, we're closed.

53:24.351 --> 53:25.725
Why?

53:35.068 --> 53:36.856
Why's that?

53:37.659 --> 53:38.935
lt's my wish.

53:42.874 --> 53:44.335
<i>It was Zoe's idea, not mine.</i>

53:45.401 --> 53:48.368
-How come l knew that?
-She says she prefers ltalian.

53:48.536 --> 53:51.285
-Your kitchen or mine?
-Wouldn't it be easier to do it here?

53:51.511 --> 53:54.064
-Fine, we'll use mine.
-But my kitchen's fully equipped.

53:54.262 --> 53:57.043
Perfect. Shall we say noon?
l'll do the shopping.

54:11.025 --> 54:13.839
-Aren't you cold?
-He's late.

54:15.504 --> 54:16.813
Men.

54:22.861 --> 54:24.138
l'll be right there.

54:24.333 --> 54:26.471
<i>-Hello?
-Help.</i>

54:26.700 --> 54:28.194
Coming!

54:33.290 --> 54:35.296
-Hey, you.
-You need a hand?

54:35.498 --> 54:36.807
No, l got it.

54:37.801 --> 54:39.710
<i>This way. l'll get that.</i>

54:39.912 --> 54:41.286
Afternoon, chef.

54:41.479 --> 54:43.813
Got the goodies. Where's the kitchen?

54:44.007 --> 54:47.202
Right there.
Yeah, yeah, right. Okay, Yeah.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.539
Okay, sous-chef, put on your apron.

54:55.044 --> 54:58.905
-Now, do you have a cast-iron pan?
-Of course l have a cast-iron pan.

54:59.682 --> 55:00.991
Good.

55:05.120 --> 55:08.021
<i>No, no, no.
Don't touch my Tupperware.</i>

55:09.248 --> 55:13.687
<i>Tonight, Zoe and l make dinner,
and only Zoe and l. Zoe.</i>

55:13.886 --> 55:16.635
-But l could help.
-But it's my wish.

55:19.676 --> 55:21.498
<i>Tonight we're making pizza.</i>

55:23.835 --> 55:25.874
-Pizza pans, please, sous-chef.
-Okay.

55:26.874 --> 55:30.288
Gotta get the flour, little eggs,
we'll roll some dough, okay?

55:30.649 --> 55:33.398
<i>Work your hands in there.
That's good.</i>

55:35.031 --> 55:37.136
Get your fingers in there.
Just like that.

55:37.335 --> 55:40.749
You create your own person and buy
them pets but you have to make enough.

55:40.918 --> 55:42.347
Nice and round.

55:42.517 --> 55:45.299
<i>Then when you're ready, go like that,
then you go like that.</i>

55:45.492 --> 55:49.103
<i>That was the first thing he taught me.
Both hands. Gotta know how to do it.</i>

55:50.035 --> 55:51.725
<i>That's what drapes over.</i>

55:52.339 --> 55:55.982
Right? Yeah, good,
and then just go like that.

55:57.744 --> 56:00.460
<i>Then you gotta sing Italiano.
You go like that.</i>

56:01.104 --> 56:03.208
<i>Then you slap it down like that.</i>

56:03.695 --> 56:06.564
Remember what l told you.
You can do it.

56:09.709 --> 56:11.367
Kate! We're ready.

56:13.963 --> 56:15.305
No shoes.

56:16.107 --> 56:17.284
Okay.

56:20.106 --> 56:22.080
Close your eyes. Come with me.

56:24.328 --> 56:27.142
-What's the secret?
-You'll see.

56:27.784 --> 56:29.060
No peeking.

56:30.215 --> 56:31.197
Almost there.

56:35.045 --> 56:37.052
Okay, open your eyes.

56:37.317 --> 56:38.527
Surprise.

56:40.260 --> 56:41.983
l guess we're not eating
at the table.

56:42.179 --> 56:44.513
We don't have one. We're on safari.

56:44.738 --> 56:46.112
l see.

56:47.266 --> 56:50.199
-You forgot the plates.
-No, no. Sit down. We don't need plates.

56:50.401 --> 56:51.677
-No plates?
-No plates.

56:51.872 --> 56:53.781
Dirty plates attract the big cats.

56:54.015 --> 56:56.120
Well, we certainly
don't want the big cats.

56:57.854 --> 56:59.763
Let me guess who made the pizza.

56:59.966 --> 57:02.420
-Me! Me. Me, me, me.
-Really?

57:15.129 --> 57:17.135
Whose idea, though? Your idea.

57:17.304 --> 57:19.060
Yours has the tusks on it.

57:26.197 --> 57:28.717
Oh, you were so close.

57:37.202 --> 57:38.249
Nothing moved.

57:38.482 --> 57:40.586
<i>But l get my eye poked out. That's okay.</i>

57:55.692 --> 57:58.626
lt's a vampire. lt's a king turtle.

58:00.491 --> 58:02.345
<i>The king, The Lion King!</i>

58:02.539 --> 58:03.913
Yes! Yes!

58:11.976 --> 58:13.404
l should put her to bed.

58:13.639 --> 58:14.849
Allow me.

58:15.590 --> 58:17.052
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:44.733 --> 58:47.220
So where did you go
to cooking school?

58:47.645 --> 58:50.033
As a young child, l sat
at my grandmother's knee--

58:50.237 --> 58:52.309
Oh, yeah, in Miami, right.

58:52.571 --> 58:56.367
lt was in Pittsburgh, actually.
My father was a steelworker.

58:56.890 --> 58:58.799
But you did go to cooking school?

58:59.002 --> 59:01.816
Are you kidding me?
Cooking was for girls.

59:02.616 --> 59:05.517
After high school,
l went backpacking through ltaly.

59:06.711 --> 59:09.328
l owe my entire career
to a girl named Sophia.

59:09.527 --> 59:11.763
-Sophia?
-She's my first love.

59:12.373 --> 59:15.471
An older woman. Nineteen.

59:15.925 --> 59:18.128
<i>Her father owned a little trattoria
in Tuscany.</i>

59:18.292 --> 59:21.040
He was a brilliant chef and he
taught me everything he knew.

59:21.202 --> 59:24.911
Sophia told him we were just friends,
so he gave me a job in his kitchen.

59:25.138 --> 59:27.145
l fell madly in love with food.

59:27.345 --> 59:29.167
ltalian food.

59:30.033 --> 59:31.941
Everything ltalian, actually.

59:32.464 --> 59:33.773
So, what happened to Sophia?

59:34.286 --> 59:37.733
Her father found out
what we were up to and he fired me.

59:37.966 --> 59:41.577
<i>-That's too bad.
-Well, it opened a lot of doors.</i>

59:41.805 --> 59:45.960
l spent the next couple of years working
in some of the best restaurants in Milan.

59:46.155 --> 59:49.220
So how come you're not running
your own kitchen by now?

59:52.137 --> 59:53.446
l don't know.

59:54.825 --> 59:56.831
l guess the right offer
hasn't come my way.

01:00:01.383 --> 01:00:04.480
So, what would you do
if you had your wish?

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.593
l got my wish.

01:00:14.307 --> 01:00:16.095
l made it this morning.

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.704
-l'm not a dessert person.
-You haven't tried my tiramisu.

01:00:28.702 --> 01:00:30.774
Well, maybe l am a dessert person.

01:00:41.563 --> 01:00:46.450
You know, in ltalian, ''tiramisu''
means ''food of the gods.''

01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:49.841
No, it doesn't.

01:00:51.096 --> 01:00:52.819
Well, it should.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.921
You have a little....
Some cream, right there.

01:01:09.938 --> 01:01:11.531
l should go.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:24.653
You're leaning on my scarf.

01:01:26.125 --> 01:01:27.880
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:29.509
Sorry.

01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:46.752
Good night.

01:01:51.397 --> 01:01:54.015
<i>He's so unpredictable.</i>

01:01:54.245 --> 01:01:56.317
-ln what way?
-ln every way.

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:59.099
He never does the right thing
at the right time. He's--

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.266
Kate. Life is unpredictable.

01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:04.634
Not in my kitchen.

01:02:05.185 --> 01:02:07.257
l'm sure you'll be able
to prevent the worst.

01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:10.326
<i>The worst?</i>

01:02:10.912 --> 01:02:13.562
<i>That he'll tolerate you
for any length of time.</i>

01:02:13.758 --> 01:02:17.913
What is this? Some new kind of therapy?
lnsult the client?

01:02:18.077 --> 01:02:19.865
Only the finest therapists use it.

01:02:24.827 --> 01:02:27.990
So l'll see you after school, okay?
Have a good day.

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:29.909
Hello, Kate.

01:02:30.106 --> 01:02:32.342
-We're on time.
-Do you have a minute?

01:02:33.177 --> 01:02:34.605
Sure.

01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:39.502
<i>I've been speaking to Zoe's teacher.</i>

01:02:39.703 --> 01:02:42.069
She's been sleeping in class a lot.

01:02:42.262 --> 01:02:44.814
And do you know
what her explanation for this is?

01:02:45.013 --> 01:02:48.079
-No.
-She says it's her late work hours.

01:02:48.244 --> 01:02:51.243
She tells her classmates she's working
as a kitchen assistant...

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:53.995
...in your restaurant
to earn her room and board.

01:02:55.026 --> 01:02:57.164
-l see.
-lf l actually believed...

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:59.750
...that Zoe was working late hours
at a restaurant...

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.538
...l'd need to contact
Child Protective Services.

01:03:02.736 --> 01:03:04.491
<i>-That won't be necessary.
-l know that.</i>

01:03:04.847 --> 01:03:09.156
lt's better for everyone when children
are well cared for by their relatives.

01:03:09.358 --> 01:03:13.350
l'd hate to see Zoe end up in foster
care after all she's been through.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.881
But l'm confident
that you will address this...

01:03:16.076 --> 01:03:18.115
...and there will be no need
to go that far.

01:03:18.347 --> 01:03:22.176
l'll be checking in on Zoe,
and we'll talk again soon.

01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:30.082
And then
Mr. Daniels' cell phone rings...

01:03:30.279 --> 01:03:34.653
...and he answers it and talks through
the whole class. lt was so funny.

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.366
Zoe, we need to talk about something.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:47.612
You can't come to work
with me anymore.

01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:49.303
Why not?

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.303
Because l'm afraid they're gonna
take you away from me.

01:03:54.336 --> 01:03:56.440
-But l like going to the restaurant.
-l know.

01:03:56.639 --> 01:04:01.340
l know you do, but it's just not right for
a little girl to be up so late, you know.

01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:04.953
-You don't want me there.
-No, that's not true.

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.962
No, you just need
to get a good night's rest.

01:04:08.604 --> 01:04:10.229
You hear me?

01:04:11.419 --> 01:04:13.328
You don't want to end up
being taken away.

01:04:13.562 --> 01:04:16.757
Who cares?
You didn't want me anyway.

01:04:19.192 --> 01:04:20.436
Zoe.

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:24.147
Zoe!

01:04:25.463 --> 01:04:26.477
Zoe!

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.972
Zoe!

01:04:38.227 --> 01:04:40.495
Zoe, stop it! Stop it!

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:46.384
Let me go! Let me go!
l want my mom, not you!

01:04:56.173 --> 01:04:57.667
Zoe?

01:05:00.332 --> 01:05:02.950
-Can l come in?
-No.

01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:06.559
Zoe, please. l'm sorry.

01:05:06.794 --> 01:05:08.768
Go away.

01:05:39.488 --> 01:05:43.000
-Hi, guys. ls your dad there?
-Yeah. Dad!

01:05:43.166 --> 01:05:45.467
-Hey. Hi.
-Hi, Sean.

01:05:45.694 --> 01:05:48.279
-How are you?
-Good. Can l ask you a favor?

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.201
-Of course.
-l know it's last minute...

01:05:50.396 --> 01:05:53.145
...but l have to go to work soon
and Zoe and l had a fight.

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.030
You want me to keep an eye on her?

01:05:55.259 --> 01:05:59.448
<i>-lf you could just check on her.
-No problem. Take it inside, guys.</i>

01:05:59.642 --> 01:06:02.358
-You got a key?
-Sure, l got it right here.

01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:05.549
<i>-Thanks, Sean.
-Hey, how are you doing?</i>

01:06:06.648 --> 01:06:09.582
-All this is pretty new to me.
-l know what might help.

01:06:10.038 --> 01:06:12.339
Call this number. Anna.
She's a godsend with kids.

01:06:12.566 --> 01:06:14.354
Saved me right after my divorce.

01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:17.450
l'm sure she'll be able to watch Zoe
for you whenever you need.

01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:20.457
<i>-Thank you.
-No problem.</i>

01:06:21.843 --> 01:06:24.526
lf you're gonna play for lreland, you're
gonna have to get stuck in better.

01:06:25.074 --> 01:06:28.073
''Ms. Armstrong introduces bits
of truffle in an endive salad...

01:06:28.273 --> 01:06:32.428
...that accompanied a lightly steamed
and wondrously silken halibut fillet.

lt was highlighted by the gorgeous aria
of her saffron-infused emulsion.''

01:06:36.175 --> 01:06:38.563

...that she brought in a great sous-chef

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.082
lt says that?

01:06:47.275 --> 01:06:49.544
Just making sure
you're paying attention.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:52.965
You look like you need a drink.

01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:55.044
l never drink at work.

01:07:08.773 --> 01:07:10.333
Are you serious?

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.466
Like that?

01:07:13.859 --> 01:07:15.801
<i>Tell me what else you never do.</i>

01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:17.593
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:21.719
Well, you never eat dessert.
You never drink at work.

01:07:22.721 --> 01:07:26.648
l'm kind of hoping you'll tell me you
never go out with guys who sing opera.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.720
l never go out with guys
who sing opera.

01:07:33.085 --> 01:07:34.612
Yes.

01:07:45.146 --> 01:07:47.535
-l got it.
-l got it.

01:07:54.615 --> 01:07:56.851
So l've got one for you.

01:07:57.046 --> 01:08:01.071
What are the three secrets
of French cuisine?

01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:03.886
Oh, come on. Everybody knows that.

01:08:04.084 --> 01:08:07.280
Oh, yeah?
So, what are they, smarty-pants?

01:08:07.795 --> 01:08:11.089
Butter, butter and butter.

01:08:11.666 --> 01:08:13.454
You're good.

01:08:14.194 --> 01:08:17.966
You know, you didn't have to do this.
lt's not like l'm drunk or anything.

01:08:19.087 --> 01:08:20.942
Sean. Hi.

01:08:22.831 --> 01:08:25.033
Nick, this is Sean, he lives downstairs.

01:08:25.326 --> 01:08:27.714
<i>This is Nick. We cook together.</i>

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:30.533
-How are you?
-You obviously don't live in the building.

01:08:31.404 --> 01:08:35.559
-How was Zoe?
-Sound asleep. She's a great kid.

01:08:35.881 --> 01:08:38.118
<i>-Have a good night.
-Thanks, Sean.</i>

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:41.154
Yeah, he's so sweet.

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:44.421
He was just keeping an eye on Zoe.

01:08:44.648 --> 01:08:48.193
He's just a sweet, nice guy.
l couldn't wish for a better neighbor.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.073
Yeah, he's always just so....

01:08:53.381 --> 01:08:55.617
--in a totally neigh--

01:09:01.091 --> 01:09:02.879
<i>Take an aspirin.</i>

01:09:04.578 --> 01:09:05.952
Yeah.

01:09:40.183 --> 01:09:41.524
<i>Come on!</i>

01:11:03.102 --> 01:11:05.240
lt's time to get up, sweetheart.

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.121
l don't wanna go to school today.

01:11:12.539 --> 01:11:14.230
Guess what.

01:11:15.674 --> 01:11:17.910
l don't wanna go to work today.

01:11:19.161 --> 01:11:20.688
Really?

01:11:22.648 --> 01:11:25.037
<i>Today it's just gonna be you and me.</i>

01:11:37.971 --> 01:11:39.978
<i>''To all the gang at 22 Bleecker...</i>

-Let's see the photo.
-Emma Jillian. Here we go.

01:11:46.096 --> 01:11:49.412
-''Seven pounds, three ounces.''
-She's adorable.

01:11:49.616 --> 01:11:53.706
''She can't wait to meet you all.
Love and kisses, Leah.''

01:11:54.671 --> 01:11:56.393
Kate's late.

01:11:57.261 --> 01:12:01.482
She asked for some time off.
Something personal came up.

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:05.258
One, two, three, four, five, six!
Yes, Park Place!

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:09.825
-And with a hotel, 1 500 bucks.
-l don't have enough.

01:12:10.218 --> 01:12:11.843
Mortgage, baby. Mortgage.

01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:14.561
Come on. l love this game.

01:12:16.488 --> 01:12:17.502
Come on.

<i>All right. Great. Thank you.
All right, so, what do l need?</i>

01:12:22.726 --> 01:12:26.434
l need a nine. Give me a nine
and it's Free Parking.

01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:28.832
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:12:31.875 --> 01:12:34.111
-Yes!
-No!

01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:35.997
<i>This isn't fair. No!</i>

01:12:36.417 --> 01:12:41.435
l'm rich. l'm rich. l'm rich!

01:12:44.095 --> 01:12:46.200
You know what this means,
don't you?

01:12:46.398 --> 01:12:47.859
-No, what does it mean?
-War!

01:13:12.118 --> 01:13:15.151
Come on and fight!
You're afraid of a little pillow?

01:13:26.898 --> 01:13:29.451
How's that rib eye doing, you guys?
l need two sea bass.

01:13:29.682 --> 01:13:33.259
All right, pancetta, goat cheese, oysters,
steak tartare, grilled rib eye.

-How much longer on that rib eye, Mario?
-Rib eye coming.

01:13:57.513 --> 01:13:59.204
You've really
mastered the menu, Nick.

01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:04.417
You put your signature on the dishes,
and all the regulars have noticed.

01:14:07.334 --> 01:14:10.878
How would you like
to stay on permanently?

01:14:14.564 --> 01:14:16.221
l think l'd like that.

01:14:16.963 --> 01:14:18.872
lf it's okay with Kate.

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:47.665
<i>-Who is it?
-Do you have any idea what time it is?</i>

01:14:48.409 --> 01:14:51.059
<i>-What?
-lt's very, very late.</i>

01:14:59.926 --> 01:15:03.667
<i>The kitchen was a very different place
without you tonight.</i>

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.539
l'm sure you did just fine without me.

01:15:11.314 --> 01:15:14.095
<i>-lt was hell.
-That's better.</i>

01:15:23.663 --> 01:15:25.091
Cognac...

01:15:26.286 --> 01:15:27.660
...white wine...

01:15:28.973 --> 01:15:30.249
...celery...

01:15:32.108 --> 01:15:34.312
...leek, shallots...

01:15:35.691 --> 01:15:37.251
...and garlic.

01:16:07.266 --> 01:16:08.923
l'm getting truffle.

01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:22.549
-l haven't.... l think l--
-Don't think.

01:16:56.786 --> 01:16:59.087
Pancake time.

01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:05.324
Pancake time.

01:17:06.127 --> 01:17:08.014
Where's my sous-chef?

01:17:08.975 --> 01:17:11.843
-Pancakes?
-You want to help me?

01:17:12.686 --> 01:17:14.540
Okay, flip it.

01:17:15.245 --> 01:17:20.000
Nice. You could start
your own restaurant. Call it Zoe's.

01:17:20.204 --> 01:17:21.861
l'll call it Nick and Zoe's.

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:24.392
Excuse me?
l did squeeze the orange juice.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:28.423
Okay. Nick and Kate and Zoe's.

01:17:28.649 --> 01:17:30.078
l like the ring of that.

01:17:32.967 --> 01:17:34.145
Not in front of Zoe.

01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:37.374
Zoe, l'm now going to kiss your aunt.

01:17:38.374 --> 01:17:40.828
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

01:17:46.659 --> 01:17:49.146
So how are we gonna
work together now?

01:17:49.314 --> 01:17:50.721
We'll do what we always did.

01:17:50.914 --> 01:17:52.223
You tell me what to do...

01:17:52.386 --> 01:17:55.287
...and l'll go behind your back
and do whatever l want.

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:23.824
l wanna show you something.
Quick! Let's go.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.968
Excuse me.
Do you have any kaffir lime leaves?

01:18:30.166 --> 01:18:32.883
-Over there. You touch, you buy.
-l know, l know.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:36.876
-What do you need those for?
-You'll see.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:39.306
Here they are.

01:18:39.603 --> 01:18:41.839
-One for you.
-Smells good.

01:18:42.066 --> 01:18:44.651
Like it? One for you.

01:18:45.553 --> 01:18:47.146
How do l know this smell?

01:18:48.497 --> 01:18:50.471
ls this your saffron sauce?

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.228
Apparently we have
no secrets anymore.

01:18:53.455 --> 01:18:54.884
You touch.

01:18:55.086 --> 01:18:56.809
l know. l buy.

01:18:57.134 --> 01:18:59.522
<i>-You buy.
-Two dollar.</i>

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.708
<i>Today for our entree special,
we are offering...</i>

01:19:46.911 --> 01:19:49.757
...a Hudson Valley free-range duck...

01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:53.113
<i>...over a butternut-squash puree...</i>

01:19:53.309 --> 01:19:57.683
...and that is served with
patty pan squash and blood orange...

01:19:57.915 --> 01:20:00.816
...and finished with
a mushroom sauce made up...

01:20:01.019 --> 01:20:03.668
-...of a variety of wild mushrooms--
-From the....

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:05.775
--from the cognac region of France.

01:20:05.977 --> 01:20:07.984
-What do you think?
-What's that?

01:20:08.184 --> 01:20:12.885
Nick came up with a great idea
of sending mini desserts home in a box.

01:20:13.495 --> 01:20:15.218
lt's so obvious.

01:20:16.598 --> 01:20:18.158
So obvious.

01:20:18.389 --> 01:20:21.290
And, Nick, l love those wines
you recommended for the new menu.

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:24.209
Well, you're gonna have to
discuss that with Kate.

01:20:25.971 --> 01:20:27.759
John, tell us
about the asparagus dish.

01:20:28.978 --> 01:20:33.002
We're also serving as a special
a side--

01:20:33.201 --> 01:20:36.680
Rather, an appetizer
with asparagus and cippolini onions...

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:39.726
...and it has a side
of sliced watermelon radishes.

01:20:40.206 --> 01:20:43.467
<i>Table five's coming up in two seconds,
chef.</i>

01:20:53.419 --> 01:20:56.517
Nick, the couple at table eight
wants to say hello.

01:20:56.682 --> 01:21:00.063
<i>-They're drooling over the sea bass.
-Kate's responsible for all the food.</i>

01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:02.532
-She hates leaving the kitchen.
-lnteresting.

01:21:02.727 --> 01:21:05.312
-What else can you tell us about her?
-You know what?

01:21:05.543 --> 01:21:08.357
l'm not gonna get into this.
l don't care who goes out there.

01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:13.950
But if it is you, do me a favor and try
not to stab anyone who complains.

01:21:14.181 --> 01:21:15.969
Don't look at me.

01:21:16.163 --> 01:21:19.065
You. Me. ln there. Now.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.887
-So, what's the story?
-What do you mean?

01:21:30.047 --> 01:21:32.119
l turn my back
for a couple of days and it's:

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.871
''Nick, the wine. Nick, the customers.
Nick, the boxes--''

01:21:35.038 --> 01:21:36.532
She offered me your job.

01:21:37.725 --> 01:21:39.131
What?

01:21:40.701 --> 01:21:42.489
Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:45.463
-l can't believe this.
-l was going to tell you.

01:21:45.658 --> 01:21:47.065
l knew l couldn't trust you.

01:21:47.226 --> 01:21:50.673
<i>-The moment l met you, l knew.
-The truth is that you can't trust anyone.</i>

01:21:50.841 --> 01:21:53.328
-You've never trusted anyone in your life.
-Guess what.

01:21:53.529 --> 01:21:55.252
Why should l when this happens?

01:21:55.576 --> 01:21:58.575
Why didn't you have the guts
just to run your own kitchen, Nick?

01:21:58.742 --> 01:22:00.913
lnstead of coming in here
and taking over mine?

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:03.727
<i>-ls that what you think?
-That's exactly what l think.</i>

01:22:09.588 --> 01:22:11.627
You know, Kate...

01:22:14.066 --> 01:22:17.709
...it's okay to let people in sometimes.
Maybe one of these days...

01:22:17.873 --> 01:22:20.142
-...you'll figure that out.
-You don't understand.

01:22:20.336 --> 01:22:22.343
<i>This place is my life.</i>

01:22:22.864 --> 01:22:25.710
<i>-This is who l am.
-No, it's not who you are.</i>

01:22:26.863 --> 01:22:28.771
lt's only one little part.

01:22:38.923 --> 01:22:40.646
Anna, it's me.

01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:42.278
Hi.

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.974
How did everything go?

01:22:48.168 --> 01:22:51.167
l think we did well.
We played Monopoly.

01:22:51.367 --> 01:22:54.083
-Who won?
-She did.

01:22:55.621 --> 01:22:56.897
<i>Thanks a lot, Anna.</i>

01:22:57.061 --> 01:22:59.362
-See you tomorrow.
-Good night.

01:23:14.336 --> 01:23:18.972
<i>Mailbox one.
You have one new message.</i>

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:23.388
<i>Monday, 1 1:54 p.m.</i>

01:23:23.613 --> 01:23:28.248
<i>Oh, and for the record,
I did turn her down.</i>

01:23:31.322 --> 01:23:33.874
<i>End of messages.</i>

01:23:37.177 --> 01:23:41.715
<i>Oh, and for the record,
I did turn her down.</i>

01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:48.012
Kate.

01:23:50.005 --> 01:23:51.467
Still awake?

01:23:52.052 --> 01:23:53.546
Where's Nick?

01:23:55.412 --> 01:23:56.938
He went home after work.

01:23:59.154 --> 01:24:01.357
Get some sleep, it's late.

01:24:03.921 --> 01:24:06.025
-Kate?
-Yeah?

01:24:08.719 --> 01:24:10.988
You can sleep with Louie if you want.

01:24:14.989 --> 01:24:17.672
Oh, honey, that's sweet of you.

01:24:18.093 --> 01:24:19.881
He needs you, l'm fine.

01:24:20.908 --> 01:24:22.369
Night-night.

01:24:27.657 --> 01:24:28.901
Night.

01:24:34.696 --> 01:24:37.859
<i>You had no right driving him out of here.
This is my restaurant.</i>

01:24:38.022 --> 01:24:41.502
-You've made that abundantly clear.
-You better find me a replacement fast.

01:24:41.701 --> 01:24:43.610
You didn't need my help
with the last one.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.561
-Kate.
-Okay. l'll find someone.

01:24:49.539 --> 01:24:52.887
Like a certificate or something?
l don't have that little piece of paper.

01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:55.773
But there's guys driving
on the street without a license.

01:24:55.969 --> 01:24:57.562
<i>They can't drive, so, you know.</i>

01:24:57.793 --> 01:24:59.647
Well, my specialty is in the beef area.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.897
l deal with meats all the time.
Sausage, beef, slaughtering pork.

01:25:04.095 --> 01:25:06.036
l'm famous
for my Vietnamese pork chops...

01:25:06.238 --> 01:25:08.757
...with saffron mashed potatoes
and key-lime asparagus.

01:25:08.925 --> 01:25:12.568
l get along great with people.
Really, l'm actually a big people person.

01:25:12.764 --> 01:25:14.487
Oh, l'm a people person.

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:17.040
l'm a team player so long
as everybody follows my lead.

01:25:17.210 --> 01:25:21.170
<i>There was a misunderstanding
between me and the head chef...</i>

01:25:21.369 --> 01:25:23.736
...and the manager and the owners.

01:25:23.928 --> 01:25:26.513
Fired is like, you know, it's,
''You're fired!'' You know.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.901
But, no, l think we parted
on amicable terms.

01:25:37.364 --> 01:25:40.298
Why doesn't Nick
come to see us anymore?

01:25:44.722 --> 01:25:47.307
We had kind of a fight.

01:25:47.794 --> 01:25:51.338
-What about?
-Just silly grown-up stuff.

01:25:55.951 --> 01:25:57.859
How come you don't wanna tell me?

01:26:00.206 --> 01:26:03.620
-lt's not that l don't wanna tell you.
-ls he ever gonna come back?

01:26:04.428 --> 01:26:06.696
No, he isn't, sweetheart.

01:26:18.824 --> 01:26:20.514
Zoe.

01:26:49.630 --> 01:26:51.517
Zoe, you awake?

01:26:52.478 --> 01:26:54.004
l'm done.

01:26:55.069 --> 01:26:56.891
Are you having breakfast?

01:27:01.787 --> 01:27:03.031
Zoe?

01:27:06.457 --> 01:27:08.977
Nick, it's me.
ls Zoe with you?

01:27:10.008 --> 01:27:11.895
l got up this morning,
and she was gone.

01:27:12.408 --> 01:27:14.676
<i>l'm here right now.
They haven't seen her.</i>

01:27:15.735 --> 01:27:19.956
l don't know. l told her about us
last night and she was upset, but....

01:27:20.117 --> 01:27:22.004
Oh, my God.

01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.308
What did the police say?

01:27:23.476 --> 01:27:26.890
<i>They checked the bus station and the
train station. She could be anywhere.</i>

01:27:27.059 --> 01:27:30.571
Well, she's a kid. She would probably
choose someplace she knew, right?

01:27:30.738 --> 01:27:33.291
She went to school and the restaurant,
that's it.

01:27:39.984 --> 01:27:43.212
Kate, it's gonna be fine.
She's gonna be all right.

01:27:43.374 --> 01:27:46.722
You know what, maybe we should check
if she's gone back home.

01:27:47.597 --> 01:27:49.222
Zoe?

01:27:50.444 --> 01:27:52.647
Maybe she left a note somewhere.

01:27:53.195 --> 01:27:54.951
She's not here.

01:28:04.936 --> 01:28:08.230
Did she take her backpack?
lf she didn't pack anything--

01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:10.561
-She didn't take Louie.
-What?

01:28:11.557 --> 01:28:14.818
She wouldn't run away
without Louie, right?

01:28:15.396 --> 01:28:18.395
l let her down, Nick. l feel like
l made a mess of everything.

01:28:18.595 --> 01:28:21.278
-We're gonna find her. l promise.
-She needs her mother.

01:28:21.443 --> 01:28:23.264
-She just needs her mother.
-Kate.

01:28:25.153 --> 01:28:27.095
l think l know where she might be.

01:28:32.095 --> 01:28:35.356
<i>-There she is right there.
-Oh, thank God.</i>

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:40.471
Zoe, are you all right?

01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:43.925
Zoe, please, don't ever do that again.

01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:46.480
l was so afraid
something happened to you.

01:28:47.899 --> 01:28:50.287
Sweetheart, what is it?

01:28:52.089 --> 01:28:54.390
l'm afraid l'm gonna forget her.

01:28:58.072 --> 01:28:59.893
We'll never forget her.

01:29:00.662 --> 01:29:02.069
l promise.

01:29:06.868 --> 01:29:08.362
Never.

01:29:19.985 --> 01:29:22.886
And we can come here
whenever you want, okay?

01:29:50.152 --> 01:29:51.810
You're coming in, aren't you, Nick?

01:29:52.551 --> 01:29:53.979
Not today, sweetie.

01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:57.313
-Guys still mad at each other?
-No.

01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:59.236
Come on.

01:30:04.803 --> 01:30:06.264
See you upstairs.

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:10.912
-You know--
-You know--

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:14.393
l just wanna say l'm sorry, Nick.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.534
Don't apologize.
l actually wanna thank you.

01:30:16.704 --> 01:30:18.743
l thought a lot about what you said...

01:30:18.911 --> 01:30:22.652
...about me not having the guts to go
after what l want, and you were right.

01:30:23.613 --> 01:30:25.075
<i>That's why...</i>

01:30:26.269 --> 01:30:27.643
...l took a job.

01:30:28.348 --> 01:30:29.908
ln San Francisco.

01:30:30.267 --> 01:30:34.422
<i>The executive chef
at a new restaurant.</i>

01:30:38.489 --> 01:30:40.431
-Well, that's great.
-Yeah.

01:30:41.784 --> 01:30:44.336
Well, l couldn't have done it
without you.

01:30:56.531 --> 01:30:58.353
Executive chef.

01:31:15.438 --> 01:31:17.771
Guy at table seven said
if he wanted it cremated...

01:31:17.933 --> 01:31:19.755
...he wouldn't have asked for it rare.

01:31:20.717 --> 01:31:23.050
<i>-That is rare.
-Apparently not rare enough.</i>

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:25.447
Any rarer, it'd walk out of here
and hail a cab.

01:31:25.611 --> 01:31:28.610
<i>Look, these are ad-agency people.
They spend a lot of money here.</i>

01:31:28.778 --> 01:31:31.744
No tantrums tonight.
Just fire another one.

01:31:34.153 --> 01:31:37.567
-Fire one rare steak on the fly.
-Rare steak on the fly.

01:31:37.735 --> 01:31:39.775
Where is the lamb for six?

01:31:39.942 --> 01:31:41.404
-How are the quail?
-Great, chef.

01:31:41.574 --> 01:31:44.421
<i>Pick up! Terrine, carpaccio.</i>

01:31:47.396 --> 01:31:49.784
From the asshole on seven again.
He wants to know...

01:31:49.987 --> 01:31:53.085
...whether you've ever seen
a rare steak before.

01:32:03.903 --> 01:32:06.074
-Rare enough for you?
-Are you out of your mind?

01:32:06.238 --> 01:32:08.310
<i>-Yeah. That's why l'm in therapy.
-l'm so sorry.</i>

01:32:08.478 --> 01:32:11.543
l'll get you a new tablecloth.

01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:14.075
No, please, let me take care of that.

01:32:15.483 --> 01:32:17.337
Not bad.

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:19.955
<i>That felt so good.</i>

01:32:23.961 --> 01:32:25.651
l just want a steak.

01:32:29.623 --> 01:32:32.491
<i>I wish there was a cookbook for life,
you know?</i>

01:32:32.695 --> 01:32:35.116
<i>With the recipes
telling us exactly what to do.</i>

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:41.194
l know. l know. You're gonna say,
''How else can we learn, Kate?''

01:32:41.364 --> 01:32:44.298
No. Actually, l wasn't gonna say that.

01:32:45.042 --> 01:32:47.562
-You wanna guess again?
-Oh, no, go ahead.

01:32:48.338 --> 01:32:52.079
What l was gonna say was
you know better than anyone.

01:32:52.784 --> 01:32:55.947
lt's the recipes you create yourself
that are the best.

01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:25.979
Hold on just a second.

01:33:30.948 --> 01:33:33.730
l think you should know
there's something else l never do.

01:33:34.404 --> 01:33:35.614
What's that?

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.648
l never invite myself
into a man's apartment, blindfold him...

01:33:38.818 --> 01:33:44.184
...and feed him saffron sauce while
begging him not to go to San Francisco.

01:33:44.865 --> 01:33:46.871
-You never do that?
-Never.

01:33:47.072 --> 01:33:48.632
<i>That's too bad.</i>

01:34:25.684 --> 01:34:28.847
-You're gonna sear that first, right?
-Yeah, chef.

01:34:32.914 --> 01:34:35.728
Don't forget to reduce
this sauce a little, okay?

01:34:35.889 --> 01:34:37.514
-You're crossing the line.
-No.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.713
Yes, you are.
Look, your spoon's in my territory.

01:34:41.711 --> 01:34:45.322
Look, l can't help if your reduction's
a little thin. l have to say something.

01:34:45.486 --> 01:34:48.006
l wouldn't talk.
Your sabayon's got lumps.

01:34:49.389 --> 01:34:50.882
You're out of your mind.

01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.644
-lt's perfect.
-l'll be the judge of that.

01:35:10.087 --> 01:35:12.094
You're right, it is perfect.

01:35:14.789 --> 01:35:16.381
Pancakes.

01:35:18.052 --> 01:35:20.441
<i>-Thank you.
-Voila.</i>

01:35:22.595 --> 01:35:24.699
Zoe, that's enough.

01:35:28.417 --> 01:35:29.977
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:35:41.054 --> 01:35:43.060
<i>Hey, Zoe. Thank you.</i>

01:35:43.228 --> 01:35:46.293
Wait. Let her tell us what.
What have we got?

01:39:54.769 --> 01:39:56.677
