03:12.067 --> 03:15.434
The young girls of rochefort

03:27.290 --> 03:32.034
Screenplay, dialogue, and songs by
Jacques demy

04:30.228 --> 04:35.188
Friday morning

05:40.090 --> 05:41.705
Set up here?

10:04.979 --> 10:07.015
That's all for today, children.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.430
Good-bye, ma'am.

10:08.566 --> 10:11.649
And don't forget
your costumes tomorrow.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.914
Delphine, come look.
They're here.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.205
They're setting up on the square.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.375
The girls won't be ready.
We'll rehearse Sunday.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.795
- No need to.
- Think so?

10:41.057 --> 10:45.050
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

10:45.228 --> 10:49.062
mi fa so la mi re
re mi fa so so so re do

10:49.232 --> 10:53.100
we're two demoiselles
who took to the boys long ago

10:53.278 --> 10:57.772
mi fa so la mi re
re mi fa so so so re do

10:57.907 --> 11:01.570
our mama
brought us up on her own

11:01.744 --> 11:05.578
working herself all her life
fo the bone

11:05.957 --> 11:09.700
to make sure
our minds could expand

11:09.919 --> 11:13.537
she's spent all her time
behind a French-fry stand

11:13.673 --> 11:17.416
papa was somebody
that we never knew

11:17.594 --> 11:21.633
but when we undress
one thing is true

11:21.806 --> 11:25.094
in the small of our backs,
in the very same place

11:25.602 --> 11:28.969
there's the same beauty spot
he had on his face

11:29.147 --> 11:32.890
we are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

11:36.988 --> 11:40.901
who love catchy tunes,
silly puns, and repartee

11:45.538 --> 11:49.030
we're a pair
of carefree young things

11:49.459 --> 11:53.122
waiting for the joys
that love brings

11:53.546 --> 11:56.959
- when our blood races
- When our heart stops

11:57.425 --> 12:00.792
we're ready to shout it
from the rooffops

12:01.179 --> 12:05.013
we are delicate souls,
two romantics

12:05.183 --> 12:08.892
in love with art,
music, and antics

12:09.270 --> 12:12.637
where's that man?
The man we long to find

12:12.982 --> 12:16.190
Mr. right...
A few faults we won't mind

12:16.319 --> 12:20.312
we are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

12:24.494 --> 12:28.328
with our feet on the ground
we have flights of fantasy

12:33.002 --> 12:36.790
teaching piano
is making me turn pale

12:36.923 --> 12:40.836
I've had it up to here
with the sound of bad scales

12:41.052 --> 12:44.840
I'm bored
with these provincial ways

12:45.014 --> 12:48.427
it's Paris for me
where art really pays

12:48.810 --> 12:52.473
dancing lessons
are starting to get me down

12:52.689 --> 12:56.523
my chance is in Paris too,
not in this town

12:56.818 --> 12:59.981
why teach plies
and pirouettes all day

13:00.655 --> 13:03.818
when I could be
in the opéra ballet?

13:03.950 --> 13:08.114
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

13:12.208 --> 13:16.076
two hearts, four eyes
ready to rhapsodize

13:20.717 --> 13:23.504
quarter to 12:00! I'm late.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.501
Delphine, pick up booboo?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.921
- Can't you?
- I'll go at 4:00.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.424
I can't wear this!
Sure, I can... no, I can't.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.847
Guillaume will be waiting.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.263
- What's he want?
- To see me.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.977
Let him wait.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.901
You coming home for lunch?

13:42.030 --> 13:44.237
Yes, but not before 1:00.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.159
Where's my compact? Here it is.

13:51.247 --> 13:55.411
We play the cello,
the trumpet, and the banjo

13:55.585 --> 13:59.373
we love catchy tunes,
silly puns, and repartee

13:59.505 --> 14:03.339
with our feet on the ground
we have flights of fantasy

14:03.509 --> 14:07.718
we are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

14:09.682 --> 14:10.922
see you later.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.297
- Where you off to?
- The cafe.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.968
Wait for us.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.078
Fries?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.986
Two orders of fries.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.495
- Fair time?
- We just arrived.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.833
- It'll boost business.
- No need for that.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.508
- We're going for a walk.
- Not now!

15:29.887 --> 15:31.502
We're not on call.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.847
What slackers!

15:35.309 --> 15:39.894
- How you treat your ladies!
- They aren't our ladies... not really.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.437
Performers?

15:41.607 --> 15:46.101
The blond does an Indian shimmy,
the redhead a Chinese shimmy.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.853
- It's harder.
- How interesting.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.028
He's the boss.
I'm his right-hand man, a mechanic.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.785
- Hello, Yvonne.
- Hello, maxence.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.574
Hello, Josette. Hello, gramps.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.118
- Still abstract?
- More than ever.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.208
He was born that way.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.710
In three days I'll be discharged.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.549
- A clacquesin.
- We're out.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.686
Aren't we?
But he can order something else.

16:21.856 --> 16:22.891
A beer.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.850
- So did you find her?
- Not yet, but I can wait.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.276
A beer for maxence.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.031
- Did he find her?
- Not yet.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.864
- What'd he lose?
- His feminine ideal.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.199
He never found her
to begin with.

16:39.373 --> 16:43.582
He painted her. He's a painter-poet.
He's stationed here.

16:43.753 --> 16:47.666
We all seek our feminine ideal.
He's not the only one.

16:51.594 --> 16:56.679
Don't be so sad, maxence.
Girls are a dime a dozen.

16:57.308 --> 17:03.224
I've searched all over for her
lve sailed the seven seas

17:03.898 --> 17:09.188
from venice fo java,
from Manila to angkor

17:09.403 --> 17:15.239
there was Jeanne and Victoria,
Venus and Mona Lisa

17:15.451 --> 17:21.195
I haven't found her yet
I seek her even more

17:21.749 --> 17:26.960
[ don't know what she's like
and yet her image is clear

17:27.128 --> 17:31.964
I have a name for her
her voice is in my ear

17:32.176 --> 17:38.172
['ve sketched her silhouette,
the face I'm dreaming of

17:38.349 --> 17:43.639
the portrait that I've done
is the very image of love

17:44.647 --> 17:50.187
she is as gracious
as only romantic girls can be

17:50.319 --> 17:55.564
a botticelli beauty
with such eyes, such poise

17:55.700 --> 18:00.820
in profile she's like
those virgins of mythology

18:00.997 --> 18:06.617
who haunt museum galleries
and the dreams of teenage boys

18:08.337 --> 18:14.128
her stride is so much like
a childhood memory

18:14.594 --> 18:19.679
that passes before my mind's eye
lilting, dreamily

18:19.974 --> 18:25.685
her hair pours down her brow
like torrents of pure gold

18:25.855 --> 18:32.397
round which wind, sea, and sun
quarrel for a hold

18:33.696 --> 18:38.531
I could tell you
of her hands, of her eyes

18:38.868 --> 18:43.953
I could go on and on
until the next sunrise

18:44.665 --> 18:50.661
she is my only love,
but what good is a dream?

18:51.339 --> 18:58.006
I've searched all over,
but she's nowhere to be seen

18:59.096 --> 19:04.762
he could tell us
of her hands, of her eyes

19:05.686 --> 19:11.101
he could go on and on
until the next sunrise

19:11.692 --> 19:17.483
she is his only love,
but what good is a dream?

19:17.907 --> 19:24.654
He's searched all over,
but she's nowhere to be seen

19:26.749 --> 19:32.289
can she be far?
Or is she close to me?

19:32.838 --> 19:38.253
I couldn't say,
but I know she does exist

19:38.511 --> 19:44.006
is she a wicked girl?
Or born to royalty?

19:44.600 --> 19:50.766
Her pedigree means nothing,
because I am an artist

19:50.898 --> 19:57.269
and love is the sole authority

20:00.616 --> 20:03.483
nice portrait,
but no one like that here.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.277
- No, no one.
- I prefer redheads.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.828
- Heavens! Have you seen delphine?
- No, ma'am.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.955
I bet she forgot
to pick up booboo.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.084
Could you go, maxence?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.959
I'm already late for maneuvers.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.881
I have to set the tables.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.969
- I'm sorry.
- Never mind.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.256
Bye, gramps.

20:34.608 --> 20:39.068
Could you two gentlemen go?
The school's just around the corner.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.811
Sure, we don't mind.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.314
You're sweet.
Just ask for booboo.

20:43.451 --> 20:47.035
- Who?
- Booboo. He's my son, my youngest.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.449
I'm afraid I can never get out.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.581
I'm confined to this aquarium.

20:54.336 --> 20:59.000
Me, who was meant to live
in the open air on the pacific shore...

20:59.967 --> 21:02.834
Listening to sweet music
and reading poetry.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.175
Yvonne, I'm out of glue.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.266
Could you buy some glue
on the way? Thanks.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.661
Hi, delphe!

21:39.423 --> 21:43.837
You're filthy! Look at you!
And in your new pants!

21:46.722 --> 21:48.883
We came to pick up booboo.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.924
- Says who?
- The lady in the café.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.518
- What nerve!
- We're on the up-and-up.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.433
We came with the fair.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.305
I bet you did.

21:58.734 --> 22:02.067
- You're quite pretty.
- So I've been told.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.320
- You'll split your dress.
- Quiet.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.568
So do we take the kid?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.903
- I wanna go with them.
- Are you kidnappers?

22:09.036 --> 22:11.573
- We wouldn't say if we were.
- Smart aleck!

22:11.997 --> 22:15.831
Actually, it suits me fine,
because - never mind.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.450
Behave yourself.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.743
Bye, pumpkin.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.582
- Your aunt's swell.
- She's my sister.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.421
She's a honey!

22:26.595 --> 22:28.335
I want some candy.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.839
We gonna stand here all day?

23:34.121 --> 23:35.782
Hello, dear Rose.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.999
You're lovely, dear soul.
By “soul” you mean my body.

23:40.169 --> 23:42.125
You're so right, dear heart.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.793
If I weren't so in love with you,
I'd be jealous.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.630
But I love you,
and that fills me with pride...

23:50.679 --> 23:52.670
And craving, since I want you.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.927
I inspire your baser feelings.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.308
And gluttony and lust.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.679
And prattle.
You love to hear yourself talk.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.098
Myself and yourself. I love you.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.520
Is that why
you wanted to see me?

24:06.695 --> 24:09.277
You don't love me,
but you'll marry me.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.609
I already said no, Guillaume.

24:11.742 --> 24:15.075
- Then why do you come?
- You're so entertaining.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.028
But if you prefer,
I'll stop coming.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.618
Why, that's me!

24:20.918 --> 24:22.158
Yes, dear Rose.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.540
Since when do you pose
for soldiers?

24:25.714 --> 24:28.376
Soldiers? What's this nonsense?

24:28.509 --> 24:31.251
Who painted that?
I told you: A soldier.

24:31.387 --> 24:35.471
Calls himself a painter and poet.
Get the picture? Know him?

24:36.725 --> 24:40.513
- An uncanny likeness, don't you think?
- Mere coincidence.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.555
- But it's me all over!
- No, it's just figurative.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.189
You're spiritual, dear soul.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.729
It's a worthless picture,
pure fantasy.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.990
He modestly calls it
feminine ideal.

24:55.577 --> 25:00.492
He must really love me
to dream me up like this. What's he like?

25:00.749 --> 25:03.582
Dull, insignificant.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.497
I want to meet him.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.417
Sorry. He just left for Paris.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.131
But he's not your type at all.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.924
You think you know me
you like to talk a lot

25:16.056 --> 25:19.344
but really you do not not not...

25:19.518 --> 25:24.262
You don't know how I feel
if you did know, you'd reel

25:24.773 --> 25:27.810
you'll never know

25:28.110 --> 25:29.941
I know how you think

25:30.070 --> 25:33.107
you'll never know
what tickles me pink pink pink

25:33.282 --> 25:38.117
what makes me play
or why I dream night and day

25:39.121 --> 25:41.908
I'm just a aoll in your gallery

25:42.082 --> 25:45.620
what did you ever see in me?

25:45.836 --> 25:48.578
You find my chatter
ledious and dumb

25:48.756 --> 25:52.294
you couldn't care less
if I'm cheerful or glum

25:52.926 --> 25:56.794
doubts are something
you don't show

25:56.972 --> 26:00.055
I'm a fool,
whether I say yes or no no no

26:00.184 --> 26:04.974
you say, 'i live only for money”
and then you say you love me

26:05.355 --> 26:08.518
if you really loved me...

26:08.692 --> 26:10.307
But I tell you every day -

26:10.486 --> 26:13.694
if you really love me
as you say say say

26:13.864 --> 26:18.949
when you tire of me, you say,
'excuse me, time is money!”

26:19.745 --> 26:22.657
But time for me is love,
my friend

26:22.831 --> 26:26.449
it's laughter and song
until the day's end

26:26.668 --> 26:29.501
and love each night
since creation

26:29.671 --> 26:32.834
time is love life is celebration

26:33.300 --> 26:37.669
so... so stop thinking
I'll be your prize

26:37.805 --> 26:40.922
you lie when
you sentimentalize, lies, lies...

26:41.100 --> 26:46.060
Buy other girls a drink
you'll find love for the price of a mink

26:46.396 --> 26:49.513
then you'll forget me

26:49.691 --> 26:54.731
- it's simpler than you think
- Any girl will give you a wink wink wink

26:54.905 --> 27:00.320
it may be a girl with velvely voice,
but love for her is on an invoice

27:00.702 --> 27:07.244
excuse me for being so blunt
I won't put feelings up front

27:07.584 --> 27:14.171
let's not drag it out for both our sakes
let's make it a friendly break

27:22.057 --> 27:23.467
Farewell, Guillaume.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.257
Good-bye, dear heart.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.907
Your eyes are the same blue
as in that picture.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.946
- I can't help it.
- Aren't they?

27:48.167 --> 27:50.749
You like blue eyes,
so you can tell.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.535
I've never seen
anything like them.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.249
How odd! It can't be abstract
if it resembles his eyes.

27:58.427 --> 28:02.136
Which aren't abstract,
so that picture sees you as I do...

28:19.031 --> 28:20.441
Look, mom.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.611
- You shouldn't have!
- It's nothing.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.409
Thanks.

28:28.248 --> 28:31.285
- Here you go, gramps.
- How kind of you.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.544
- Will you have a drink?
- Why not?

28:35.839 --> 28:37.625
We met a knockout blond.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.960
- Your sister.
- I don't have a sister.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.719
- He means delphe.
- Delphine... my daughter.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.054
- She's a peach.
- So are you.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.673
So I've been told.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.970
S.0.s.! Storm at sea!

28:50.103 --> 28:51.968
Be quiet, booboo.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.147
Hello, dutrouz.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.436
Hello, everyone.

28:57.611 --> 28:59.977
They're friends. Subtil dutrouz.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.522
“Subtil” like a scent,
dutrouz with a silent z.

29:03.700 --> 29:07.113
- Bill as in “billiards.”
- Etienne, like everyone else.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.285
- Here, for you.
- What is it?

29:09.414 --> 29:11.655
A plastic atomic submarine.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.744
- How's it holding?
- Fine.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.326
That's good.

29:15.545 --> 29:19.254
I just saw them tramping by,
armed to the teeth.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.499
They'd shoot us like rabbits.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.840
- What'll you have?
- Nothing. I'm off.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.504
I'll be back later.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.679
- Who's that?
- A friend of gramps'.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.935
- What's he do?
- He's retired.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.105
- What exactly do you do?
- Us?

29:37.317 --> 29:40.980
We go from place fo place
with motorcycles to sell

29:41.113 --> 29:44.480
bikes and boats as well
the road's our home base

29:44.658 --> 29:46.614
- today we're here
- Tomorrow there

29:46.743 --> 29:50.201
we live free as the arr,
like boys without a care

29:50.372 --> 29:55.492
on the move, having fun,
avoiding shadows for the sun

29:55.711 --> 29:59.044
we prefer
what is sweet, not sour

29:59.214 --> 30:02.798
a pretty girl, not a wallflower

30:03.552 --> 30:05.383
and pleasure, not despair

30:06.847 --> 30:10.385
we flit from face to face,
like bees among the flowers

30:10.559 --> 30:14.017
in every port a pretty girl,
in every town some tender hours

30:14.146 --> 30:17.764
we live on the heady brine,
a baker's loaf, a sip of wine

30:17.983 --> 30:21.521
the morning haze,
the evening storm

30:21.653 --> 30:24.395
a child's smile fo make us warm

30:24.531 --> 30:28.490
the siesta at midday

30:28.618 --> 30:32.031
making love in the hay

30:32.914 --> 30:34.996
the wind on our face

30:36.251 --> 30:39.743
we go from town fo town
the future's an unknown

30:39.880 --> 30:43.418
a pretty girl lends a hand
and life is grand

30:43.592 --> 30:45.253
toaay here - tomorrow there

30:45.469 --> 30:48.632
our life's a romance,
a melody composed by chance

30:48.764 --> 30:50.550
full of new delights

30:50.682 --> 30:53.515
we prefer joy to misery

30:53.643 --> 30:57.431
intelligence fo stupidity

30:57.647 --> 31:01.185
straight talk to hypocrisy

31:01.985 --> 31:04.271
and gentle arms fo gendarmes

31:05.197 --> 31:08.735
we go from fair to fair
folks point and stare

31:08.867 --> 31:12.325
they call us carnies,
but poets are what we are

31:12.454 --> 31:14.445
- today we frown
- Tomorrow laugh

31:14.664 --> 31:18.031
life's a double bil,
a trageaqy of fate

31:18.210 --> 31:22.954
a comealy of good will
as friends we will grow old

31:23.215 --> 31:30.337
knights without fear or blame
we haven't a penny to our name

31:31.264 --> 31:33.926
but our hearts are made of gold

31:34.476 --> 31:37.968
we go from place fo place,
across rivers and valleys

31:38.146 --> 31:41.980
they call us carnies
the road is our home base

32:56.641 --> 32:59.758
- What's wrong?
- I'm sad and bored.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.894
You're hiding something.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.476
It's over with Guillaume.

33:05.609 --> 33:08.851
That's good news.
I never liked the guy.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.227
Know what I'm thinking?

33:10.572 --> 33:12.528
Yes, about your dream man.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.737
How'd you guess?

33:13.909 --> 33:16.025
It's simple, darling.

33:17.037 --> 33:20.825
You have that “dream man”
look on your face.

33:22.209 --> 33:26.873
I know nothing of him
and yet his image is clear

33:27.422 --> 33:31.916
I have a name for him
his voice is in my ear

33:32.260 --> 33:37.345
often, when I dream,
I see the face I'm thinking of

33:43.939 --> 33:48.683
He is handsome
as only romantic men can be

33:48.985 --> 33:53.570
like divine Raphael,
his talent is heavenly

33:53.782 --> 33:58.902
a philosopher
in love with democracy

33:59.204 --> 34:04.699
and a poet who rhymes endlessly

34:05.585 --> 34:09.998
I could tell you
of his hands, of his eyes

34:10.465 --> 34:14.754
I could go on and on
until the next sunrise

34:14.969 --> 34:20.556
he is my only love,
but what good is a dream?

34:21.016 --> 34:27.138
The illusion of love
is only love unseen

34:28.275 --> 34:33.485
is he near or far?
Could he be in rochefort?

34:33.862 --> 34:39.027
I'm sure fo meet him
I know he does exist

34:39.369 --> 34:44.534
whatever reason says,
my heart tells me more

34:44.833 --> 34:50.418
[ts reign, ils law
is something one can't resist

34:50.964 --> 34:57.335
and resist I never will

35:00.724 --> 35:05.468
sweetie, guys like that
don't hang out in rochefort.

35:05.729 --> 35:09.768
Not right now.
He's in Paris. He did my portrait.

35:10.025 --> 35:12.266
Who is it?
You never mentioned him.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.018
A painter. I don't know him.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.361
He exists, and he loves me.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.397
But I've never seen him.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.366
- You're ill.
- I'm serious.

35:22.537 --> 35:24.869
- To Paris, then!
- And our pupils?

35:24.998 --> 35:27.034
- Qur careers first.
- Without money?

35:27.208 --> 35:29.369
Never mind that.
For now we're free.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.660
We leave for Paris next week.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.503
This afternoon
I'll go see Mr. dame -

35:34.758 --> 35:36.498
what's so funny?

35:36.676 --> 35:39.088
Nothing.
That's such a silly name.

35:39.304 --> 35:42.296
He's very nice.
And he knows Andrew Miller.

35:42.432 --> 35:45.549
- Who's that?
- I don't know.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.723
An American composer.
They went to school together.

35:49.898 --> 35:53.311
Andrew Miller is giving
some recitals in Paris,

35:53.443 --> 35:56.276
and Simon dame
will tell him about me.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.237
I mean, in a letter.
Then I'll get booboo.

35:59.366 --> 36:02.699
No need to.
Mom sent two guys this morning.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.406
I went for nothing.
Booboo left with them.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.747
You let booboo go off
with two strangers?

36:09.000 --> 36:13.084
The town's crawling with soldiers,
sadists, and unknown painters!

36:13.254 --> 36:15.745
You'll never get a man, old girl.

36:15.882 --> 36:21.093
You were born 12 minutes later,
so don't “old girl” me! As for men -

36:21.429 --> 36:22.919
that's it! - What?

36:23.056 --> 36:25.468
I've got the theme
for my concerto!

36:55.004 --> 36:56.494
Good day, sisters.

36:56.673 --> 36:59.164
Schubert's “ave Maria.”

37:03.054 --> 37:04.464
Here we are.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.807
- Is that all?
- Yes, thank you.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.105
Good-bye, Mr. dame.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.152
- Hello, Mr. dame.
- Hello, miss.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.980
Your music paper arrived.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.486
I'm sorry about the delay.

37:26.619 --> 37:30.203
Setting up this store
has taken a lot out of me.

37:30.331 --> 37:33.664
Rochefort isn't Paris,
and I haven't adapted yet.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.408
It looks really nice.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.833
I've tried to recreate
a musical atmosphere.

37:39.215 --> 37:42.207
Now, where did I put it?
Here it is.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.926
Ready for the fair?
The girls rehearse daily.

37:48.683 --> 37:51.345
I wrote a little piece for them,

37:51.519 --> 37:53.931
a three-part chorale in c minor.

37:54.105 --> 37:55.595
How much is it?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.309
Twelve francs.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.103
Please call me Simon.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.320
Really?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.691
My name's so silly.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.115
I'm called solange.

38:07.577 --> 38:10.535
The key of so

38:10.705 --> 38:14.118
and the flight of angels.
The name suits you.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.164
I have a favor to ask.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.537
Go ahead.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.206
I plan to go to Paris next week.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.176
You hinted last Tuesday

38:26.346 --> 38:29.008
that you could
recommend me to your friend,

38:29.140 --> 38:31.176
Andrew Miller, the composer.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.140
Andy? Certainly.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.227
I haven't seen him
since conservatory days.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.848
After school
Andrew went back to the states

38:40.193 --> 38:43.105
and found fame and fortune.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.900
Life's come between us.

38:47.033 --> 38:51.618
You're in luck - he's in France.
I'll write to him right away.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.571
I'm sure he can help you.

38:56.042 --> 39:00.581
You'll become a great composer,
solange. A great composer.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.038
I hope so.

39:04.509 --> 39:08.502
I have the third movement
for my concerto in f sharp minor.

39:08.763 --> 39:11.505
Would you care to hear it?
With pleasure.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.566
Admirable!

40:06.154 --> 40:10.022
What texture, originality, passion!
What force! What lyricism!

40:10.450 --> 40:12.441
I like it a lot too.

40:14.495 --> 40:17.578
- When do you leave?
- Monday, after the fair.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.790
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

40:21.169 --> 40:24.832
But when my fiancee
left 10 years ago,

40:25.465 --> 40:29.174
I felt the same twinge
in my heart.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.755
Your fiancée?

40:32.180 --> 40:35.172
It was because of her
that I left Paris.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.718
I moved here last month
to relive my memories.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.640
Does she live in rochefort?

40:41.773 --> 40:44.059
No, Mexico.

40:44.984 --> 40:46.849
But we met here.

40:47.528 --> 40:51.817
It's an unusual story
for an ordinary man like me.

40:53.159 --> 40:57.698
My fiancee
found my name a bad joke

40:58.331 --> 41:02.574
I think it even shocked her,
and one day I awoke

41:02.710 --> 41:07.124
to find shed left me
without a word, without a sign

41:07.382 --> 41:11.876
I haven't laid eyes on her
in 10 years' time

41:12.178 --> 41:16.467
she had fold me
one night so tenderly

41:16.766 --> 41:21.055
that we were soon to be
no longer two but three

41:21.229 --> 41:25.723
it fills a man with pride
it's woman's greatest claim

41:26.150 --> 41:31.235
but she couldn't stand
being called madame dame

41:32.907 --> 41:37.651
yet she cared for me
and I called her my muse

41:37.829 --> 41:41.993
but I had no idea -
how poets will be amused! -

41:42.125 --> 41:46.494
that a name like mine
could shame and irritate

41:47.005 --> 41:51.123
I didn't understand
until it was too late

41:51.384 --> 41:55.753
I was a handsome fellow
and she a sweet young thing

41:55.930 --> 42:00.594
she hadn't planned it
but had already mothered twins

42:00.768 --> 42:05.102
I never met the girls,
who were always out of sight

42:05.398 --> 42:10.017
they went to boarding school
and never came home at night

42:12.113 --> 42:16.732
a few years later
I met a mutual friend

42:17.035 --> 42:20.948
who told me some foreigner
had married her in the end

42:21.414 --> 42:25.748
and taken her away
to a place in Mexico

42:26.127 --> 42:30.496
to live romantically
in a seaside bungalow

42:30.715 --> 42:34.958
so here [ Am alone,
a lover in despair

42:35.261 --> 42:39.630
I came to see this city
since ld met her here

42:39.974 --> 42:44.388
I decided not to leave
and here I plan to stay

42:44.562 --> 42:51.229
living with my memories
and my heart at bay

42:54.030 --> 42:56.863
- you never saw her again?
- Never.

42:57.742 --> 43:00.449
She must be living it up
in acapulco.

43:00.661 --> 43:02.993
She worshipped the sun.

43:03.372 --> 43:05.488
Here I am going on and on!

43:07.001 --> 43:10.493
I'll write to Andy.
I hope he hasn't forgotten me.

43:10.671 --> 43:13.333
- Maybe he got a swell head.
- What?

43:13.508 --> 43:15.464
He may be pretentious.

43:15.843 --> 43:18.676
No, Andy was a bright fellow.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.588
I'm sure you'll like him.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.632
4:00 already!

43:48.918 --> 43:50.579
I doubt shée'll come.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.709
The kid can't walk home alone.

43:52.880 --> 43:54.086
Excuse me.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.126
Let the young lady by.

44:11.399 --> 44:13.355
- Hi, solange.
- Hi, pumpkin.

44:13.693 --> 44:15.558
Your slip's showing.

44:17.029 --> 44:19.270
Fighting again! Look at you!

44:19.407 --> 44:21.113
You naughty boy!

44:22.076 --> 44:24.909
- Hi, booboo.
- Ah, you're here?

44:25.079 --> 44:28.287
- What do you want?
- We've come to pick up booboo.

44:28.457 --> 44:29.742
These are my buddies.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.578
We're here with the fair.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.663
- When do you leave?
- Monday.

44:33.880 --> 44:35.620
Then bon voyage!

44:36.048 --> 44:39.290
Miss, your slip is showing.

44:39.427 --> 44:40.963
So I've been told.

44:41.095 --> 44:42.926
Your aunt's not very nice.

44:43.055 --> 44:44.591
She's my sister.

44:44.932 --> 44:46.763
She sure has changed.

44:46.934 --> 44:48.515
Come on, skip it.

44:48.644 --> 44:50.635
They buy me candy.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.269
I'll get you licorice.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.431
I want to go with them!

44:54.775 --> 44:56.436
Then no licorice!

45:16.672 --> 45:18.537
I'm sorry.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.962
Don't mention it.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.937
- Are you a musician?
- Yes.

45:40.947 --> 45:42.153
Good-bye.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.648
Miss, your slip is showing.

45:46.702 --> 45:49.159
I know, but it doesn't matter.

45:49.330 --> 45:50.991
Miss...

45:52.583 --> 45:54.619
May I see you again?

45:54.752 --> 45:56.413
I don't know.

45:56.963 --> 45:58.749
I don't think so.

46:02.009 --> 46:03.340
Come on.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.256
That guy's got some nerve.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.857
Say, that's in g minor!

46:27.827 --> 46:29.408
I'm in love, I am

46:29.620 --> 46:31.326
lucky you!

46:31.497 --> 46:33.533
I do what I can

46:50.599 --> 46:54.217
I come fo rochefort
lo see a friend

46:54.562 --> 46:58.305
Simon dame,
he lives out this end

46:58.482 --> 47:01.974
but I meet a gir! And I go crazy

47:02.236 --> 47:05.899
the girl's gone
but love's fazed me

47:21.422 --> 47:25.085
It took a trip
across two continents

47:25.426 --> 47:28.918
it took this one amazing chance

47:29.180 --> 47:32.843
to change my life
and give it sense

47:33.017 --> 47:36.885
it took my coming back fo France

49:02.356 --> 49:06.019
- Ready?
- We can't go without saying good-bye.

49:06.402 --> 49:09.235
My heart's racing.
That's normal.

49:09.363 --> 49:13.948
Look: First, I've had it.
Second, they exploit us.

49:14.076 --> 49:18.160
Third, I don't love etienne.
Fourth, bill's eyes aren't blue.

49:18.289 --> 49:21.406
Fifth, adventure beckons.
And sixth -

49:21.542 --> 49:23.123
here they come.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.375
What's with you?

49:28.507 --> 49:30.919
Can't you see? We're leaving.

49:31.260 --> 49:32.875
- What?
- We're leaving.

49:33.012 --> 49:36.220
- With who?
- Two sailors.

49:36.390 --> 49:39.348
Don't whine. It's pointless.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.058
They're dumb.

49:41.228 --> 49:44.061
We love them,
but that's not the worst.

49:44.315 --> 49:48.649
We give them a golden opportunity,
and they cut out before a show.

49:48.819 --> 49:51.060
And for who? Sailors!

49:52.239 --> 49:57.575
Sailors give us a better time
than all your carnies combined

49:57.745 --> 50:02.830
- sailors aren't the marrying kind
- But as lovers they're just fine

50:03.000 --> 50:07.664
as friend, lover, or husband,
sallors are absent all the time

50:09.173 --> 50:14.543
chance often does things right,
but it got its wires crossed

50:14.720 --> 50:22.720
with the faded roses it tossed
on the bed of our lonely nights

50:26.023 --> 50:31.393
well, if our bed of roses
is now just full of thorns

50:31.695 --> 50:36.940
and your heart is now sea-born,
what can I say or propose?

50:37.117 --> 50:42.157
Shall I shoot you and mourn?
Or die broken and morose?

50:43.541 --> 50:48.752
You had what it takes to please:
Your nose, mouth, brow, and hair

50:49.046 --> 50:57.046
if only your eyes were blue
I could have died for you

51:00.808 --> 51:06.303
if my eyes, dear marquise,
are not worth aying for

51:11.944 --> 51:14.401
Should I go down on my knees?

51:14.530 --> 51:16.612
Should I die of jealousy?

51:18.409 --> 51:23.779
You mustn't hold a grudge
or I'll get all teary-eyed

51:23.914 --> 51:31.914
my makeup is going fo smuage
I'm already bleary-eyed

52:33.859 --> 52:39.070
Fly away, turfledoves
get along to your tropics

52:39.239 --> 52:44.484
since our eyes are not topics
to make you melt with love

52:44.620 --> 52:47.282
go on then, my lovelies

52:47.414 --> 52:50.076
good sailing and good loving

53:06.100 --> 53:07.965
You thought it over?

53:10.854 --> 53:15.939
We flit from face fo face
like bees among the flowers

53:16.193 --> 53:18.650
today we're here, tomorrow there

53:18.779 --> 53:23.614
for us life's a cinch

53:32.084 --> 53:36.623
Braque, Picasso,
klee, miro, Matisse -

53:37.214 --> 53:38.875
that's life!

53:39.049 --> 53:40.789
Sure, life!

53:41.135 --> 53:43.000
But how do you manage?

53:43.137 --> 53:45.298
Don't tell me
you paint in the barracks.

53:45.431 --> 53:48.719
No one paints in barracks.

53:48.976 --> 53:52.218
I have a room in town.
I's my studio.

53:52.730 --> 53:56.769
Every night I go awol,
and I go home and paint.

53:57.484 --> 54:01.443
Next week I go to Paris,
and in six months, a show.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.984
- If you're released.
- That's not funny.

54:04.158 --> 54:06.945
There's trouble everywhere,
like in '39.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.284
That's how it started in '39.

54:09.413 --> 54:12.496
I saw you this morning
doing your clown act.

54:12.875 --> 54:15.958
We were on maneuvers.
Think I enjoy it?

54:16.253 --> 54:17.743
Cut it out!

54:17.963 --> 54:20.500
Next week I'm a civilian.
Freedom!

54:20.632 --> 54:22.964
Monday. Right, Yvonne?

54:25.429 --> 54:27.590
It's sad to see everyone leave.

54:27.723 --> 54:29.759
Why everyone?

54:30.976 --> 54:32.512
No special reason.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.977
Reminds me of my past.

54:36.106 --> 54:38.563
It's none of your business,
of course.

54:39.067 --> 54:41.274
You'll break that chair.

54:41.737 --> 54:43.728
A past love, I suppose?

54:43.864 --> 54:45.695
What else?

54:47.534 --> 54:49.195
It was...

54:50.746 --> 54:52.737
A secret passion.

54:53.707 --> 54:55.789
I never told anyone.

54:56.210 --> 54:58.496
No one ever found out.

54:58.962 --> 55:00.498
Not even my daughters.

55:00.631 --> 55:03.623
The daughters
you're always going on about!

55:03.759 --> 55:06.546
I'd like to meet them. Hush up!

55:06.720 --> 55:11.464
And this passion went sour,
if I get your meaning.

55:11.975 --> 55:16.639
My fiance had a name
that was grating to the ear

55:16.772 --> 55:21.061
an irritating name
that was more than I could bear

55:21.235 --> 55:25.444
so [ Went and left him
without a word, without a sign

55:25.614 --> 55:30.028
it's been 10 years now
since his path diverged from mine

55:30.160 --> 55:34.324
I had fold him
one night so tenderly

55:34.581 --> 55:38.824
that we were soon to be
no longer two but three

55:39.086 --> 55:43.170
its a woman's greatest claim
it fills a man with pride

55:43.298 --> 55:47.917
booboo, the poor dear,
would soon be by my side

55:50.180 --> 55:54.423
he was a handsome fellow
and I a sweet young thing

55:54.601 --> 55:58.765
even though I had twins
before I met him

55:58.939 --> 56:03.273
he never met the girls
I kept them out of sight

56:03.569 --> 56:07.733
they went to boarding school
and never came home at night

56:08.031 --> 56:12.195
a few years later,
through a mutual friend

56:12.452 --> 56:16.741
I let him know
that some tycoon from Mexico

56:16.874 --> 56:21.334
had offered me his hand
and a beachside bungalow

56:21.628 --> 56:26.042
it was bitter lie,
pathetic duplicity

56:27.968 --> 56:32.462
so here I am alone,
and my youth is long gone

56:32.764 --> 56:37.007
I came to see this town
where the only love I'd known

56:37.144 --> 56:41.478
had seen the day
I settled here permanently

56:41.648 --> 56:47.484
living amid memories,
my life's debris

56:49.990 --> 56:52.276
you don't know
what became of him?

56:52.534 --> 56:55.401
No. He's probably in Paris.

56:55.662 --> 56:58.449
You should try and find him.

56:59.875 --> 57:02.412
What was this monster's name?

57:03.378 --> 57:05.994
Dame. Simon dame.

57:06.590 --> 57:09.172
I'd have become
madame dame. Absurd!

57:09.301 --> 57:10.666
He was a bastard!

57:10.802 --> 57:12.633
Not at all, papa. Calm down.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.424
A bastard!

57:14.556 --> 57:18.174
Maybe so,
but he had a charming name.

57:18.352 --> 57:20.217
“Madame dame.”

57:20.354 --> 57:22.094
It's amusing.

57:22.606 --> 57:25.473
- So I did wrong?
- I didn't say that.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.697
- Shall we?
- It's figurative?

57:34.409 --> 57:37.116
I told you:
It's my only figurative work.

57:37.245 --> 57:39.031
The abstracts are at camp.

57:42.167 --> 57:43.873
You coming with us?

57:44.044 --> 57:46.251
To see my feminine ideal. Where?

57:46.421 --> 57:50.414
On show at Guillaume lancien's gallery.
Around the corner.

57:50.592 --> 57:52.423
Sorry, I really can't.

57:52.552 --> 57:55.510
- You snub my work.
- No, I don't.

57:56.056 --> 57:58.342
So long. Coming?

58:12.072 --> 58:14.484
- You've been crying.
- Not at all.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.649
Don't lie. I can tell.

58:27.254 --> 58:30.087
- I like your hat.
- So do I.

58:31.466 --> 58:33.377
Is that all that's new?

58:33.510 --> 58:36.297
I'm flustered:
I just met my dream man.

58:37.597 --> 58:39.258
Otherwise, we're working.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.549
I haven't seen delphine
in three days.

58:42.686 --> 58:44.517
We're hard at work.

58:47.733 --> 58:51.146
I'll work with the philharmonic,
and delphine the opéra.

58:52.237 --> 58:56.480
We're not going to rot here.
Well, you're big girls now.

58:57.951 --> 59:01.114
Dutrouz's right:
There's trouble everywhere.

59:01.288 --> 59:04.121
Why this urge
to fight all the time?

59:04.791 --> 59:06.497
I forgot my beret.

59:07.794 --> 59:09.500
So long, maxence.

59:12.215 --> 59:13.876
Who's that?

59:14.009 --> 59:17.467
Maxence. A painter
doing his military service.

59:19.556 --> 59:23.174
Get down!
I told you not to walk on the tables!

59:27.230 --> 59:28.470
Leaving already?

59:28.648 --> 59:30.559
I'm going home. Bye, mom.

59:30.859 --> 59:33.191
Come for dinner tomorrow.
Dutrouz will be there.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.982
- Who's dutrouz?
- You don't know him?

59:36.615 --> 59:39.197
A friend of gramps'
from back in 24.

59:39.326 --> 59:42.614
They met last week
for the first time in 40 years.

59:42.746 --> 59:44.907
- See you tomorrow.
- Till then.

59:45.832 --> 59:47.993
You again?

59:51.379 --> 59:53.335
Your sister's charming.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.669
- That's my daughter.
- Her too?

59:56.843 --> 01:00:00.051
I had twins by a first lover,
but they're not identical.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.466
Then I had booboo, much later.

01:00:02.641 --> 01:00:04.006
Another lover.

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:06.220
Be polite. I'm not in the mood.

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.015
We aren't either.
We've got trouble.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.188
- Is that so?
- The girls left us.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:15.525
- The girls?
- The ones you saw this morning.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:20.364
They do a number for us -
not bad, in fact - to draw customers.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.028
The Asian shimmy.

01:00:22.494 --> 01:00:25.986
That's right.
So now we're up the creek.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:29.490
You won't find anyone here
to do an Asian shimmy.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.708
That... or something else.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:34.036
Your daughters could help us.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.003
Don't count on it.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:37.623
They can dance, no?

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:39.549
Delphine dances.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:43.507
Solange sol-fa's.
She writes music. She can dance too.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.972
But they won't do it.
You don't think so?

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.637
I'm sure of it.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.556
With their talent,
they're not going to rot here.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.766
Next week they're off to Paris.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.065
What'll it be? - White wine?

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.897
Two glasses.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:01.901
It wouldn't hurt to ask.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:05.363
- It's worth a try.
- Nothing ventured...

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:10.663
Oh, my god!

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:15.084
One of booboo's pranks.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.631
That's her.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:27.339
Your ideal?

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:31.426
I once knew a young lady

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.221
who looked a bit like that.

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.477
A dancer.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:40.064
This was 40 years ago.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.647
But she was a brunette,
with short hair.

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:47.359
- Then not at all alike.
- Not really.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.538
A slight resemblance here.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:55.333
But I don't know
anyone like that.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:58.624
You won't find that sort
in rochefort.

01:01:58.798 --> 01:02:03.588
I've searched for her
lve traveled countless miles

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:08.589
from ball fo Lima,
across the south sea isles

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:13.802
from deep river beds
fo beds where young girls smile

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:19.691
I keep running after her,
hoping all the while

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:24.647
just knowing she's alive
makes her my beacon fire

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:28.863
knowing she's out there
fills me with more desire

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:34.324
than all the naked girls
in my wildest fantasies

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:40.292
I've looked everywhere
[Ve sailed the seven seas

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:46.339
can she be far?
Is she close to me?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:51.181
I couldn't say,
but I know that she exists

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:56.516
is she a wicked girl
or born to royalty?

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.022
A movie celebrity

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.771
or a simple florist?

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:05.904
I know she'll belong fo me

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.600
That's all, children.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.538
I met my dream man!

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:58.997
Where?

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.084
In the street.

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.585
Tell me.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:08.546
I picked up booboo at school
he was whining and being a fool

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:15.595
he threw a tantrum in the street
he slammed his bag down at his feet

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:20.641
there I am, with bikes wheeling round
picking up notebooks from the ground

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:27.857
when I hear a masculine sigh
I look up to see this beautiful guy

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:32.274
he pours words
in my ear like honey

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:37.113
humming like a swarm
of playful bees

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.829
I look at him
his eyes lake me in

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:46.671
my heart goes into a spin

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:51.505
he's dark, with an intelligent air,
streaks of grey in his hair

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:58.642
like a Shepherd or troubadour
it was like a concerto overture

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:18.866
His languid gaze
says more than [ Can tell

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.249
we're both caught
in the same spell

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:28.331
booboo's waiting
traffic's rolling still

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:33.255
but time has stopped
for our iayll

01:05:33.513 --> 01:05:38.052
but we really have to part
my handsome stranger gives a start

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:44.062
he says, his emotion growing,
“excuse me, but your slip is showing”

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:47.436
and that was all

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:58.444
Is he near or far?
Can he be in rochefort?

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:04.036
[Ll find him
because I know that he exists

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:10.122
I know what reason says,
but my heart can tell me more

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:16.219
[ts reign, ils law
is something no one can resist

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:23.056
and resist I never will

01:06:25.857 --> 01:06:28.439
surely a foreigner or a tourist.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:31.184
- Why? Did he have an accent?
- I don't remember.

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:32.943
A camera?

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:34.775
So why an American?

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.650
I said a foreigner,
not an American.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.909
Not all foreigners are American.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:41.994
But they're often tourists.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.118
Good lord! What if it's him?

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.374
It's Jules and Jim!

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:54.503
You two again! You know them?

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.877
Yes, we've met.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:59.379
Don't stand there in the doorway.
I'm cold.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:02.882
What do you want?

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:06.056
- Well, your mother, Yvonne -
- Yeah, right!

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.688
- Let them talk.
- Yes, let us talk.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:12.650
Your mother, Yvonne,
said you were going to Paris.

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:13.814
That's right.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:17.235
- And you needed someone to take you.
- We never said that.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:19.699
Anyway, we can take you.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:21.909
- In the truck?
- There are bunks.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.574
I can see it now.

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.118
- We're serious.
- What a come-on!

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.745
Well... is that all?

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.712
- We want to make a deal.
- But not in the doorway.

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:36.086
Take these.

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:53.149
Well?

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:57.271
- Tell them. After all, it's your idea.
- But you're the boss.

01:07:57.448 --> 01:07:59.439
We're in no hurry.

01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:01.532
Well...

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:06.280
To liven up our stand at the fair,
we thought -

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.790
well, it was bill's idea.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.916
We thought that maybe

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:14.333
you could do a number -
something lively.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:15.747
A number?

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.667
- They think we're strippers.
- Obviously.

01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:22.508
The fact is,
the artists we hired

01:08:22.682 --> 01:08:25.173
left us high and dry
at the last minute,

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.182
and we need...

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:29.350
- Stand-ins.
- Just like that.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:30.970
That's right.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:33.098
So... are you interested?

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:37.569
Interested isn't the word.
But we'll think it over.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:40.529
We're quite busy at the moment.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.694
Does that mean yes or no?

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.323
- What do you think?
- But what do they want?

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:49.413
- Something lively.
- You said that already.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.086
Something in this vein?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:07.591
In Hamburg, port of call,
on a rain-slicked street

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:12.265
three sailors and love meet
and go to the losers' ball

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.934
it's a foursome on the fown
when three girls on the make

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:22.064
meet losers on a round
on the street of heartbreak

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:27.072
in Hamburg, port of call,
three sailors from the east

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:31.740
talk of romance's thrall
as if they believed it all

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:34.203
as if for that price

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:38.706
the girls of the waterfront
would give these sailor boys

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:42.629
all the love they want

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.174
How was that?

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:54.641
- Depressing.
- And old as the hills.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:57.732
We've had it
with sailors, girls, and boats.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.691
We get the message.

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:02.233
- Our song?
- They'll like that.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:06.654
We are a pair of twins
born in the sign of gemini

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:14.783
with our feet on the ground
we have flights of fantasy

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:23.171
give us a happy start
give us Harmony

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:27.295
give it heart
and a touch of sorcery

01:10:27.473 --> 01:10:31.557
let it burst with joy
let it glow with energy

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:35.850
give us a song give us fantasy

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:39.850
want us to dance too?
Modern or classic?

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:44.525
Something fo prance fo
or more romantic?

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:58.827
Would you like Mozart?
Would you like stravinsky?

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:02.330
Johann Sebastian bach?

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:04.549
Or maybe boguslawski?

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:09.046
Louis Armstrong? Ellington?

01:11:09.348 --> 01:11:13.512
Count basile or Hampton?

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:18.680
Or maybe you'd prefer

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:21.520
Michel legrand?

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:24.485
Sing of love - or even hate

01:11:24.655 --> 01:11:26.566
just make it bright

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.732
sing today - dance tonight

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:30.733
sing of light

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.028
dance for joy sing of wind

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:34.946
sing of sun and of rain

01:11:35.082 --> 01:11:37.038
fire us - inspire us

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.872
enchant and astonish us

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:45.795
hang out the streamers of sun
paint it all the color of delight

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:52.677
drape every facade in light
build bonfires of pleasures and fun

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:57.970
why waste time?
Why push me away?

01:11:58.105 --> 01:12:01.393
You'll be my wife...

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.605
Why a seaside bungalow?

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:09.356
Why a millionaire from Mexico?

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:14.612
You can't whine
till your dying day

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:18.907
the Harmony's sublime

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:23.078
what a paradigm

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:34.176
Where are the pretty hands
that wrote these notes?

01:12:40.147 --> 01:12:44.857
Must I never see her again?

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:50.071
Why love on some pacific shore

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:55.653
when it's right here in my store?

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:04.039
And at the same time

01:13:04.171 --> 01:13:06.662
a true stroke of chance

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.290
find my great romance

01:13:09.468 --> 01:13:11.925
the very aay I leave

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.965
passion - spirit

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.131
love - folly

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.425
genius - joy

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.472
life and happiness

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:40.386
Saturday morning

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.560
You're alone?

01:14:52.738 --> 01:14:56.151
Josette took booboo to school.
Gramps is still asleep.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:00.701
Going somewhere?
I have two days of leave left.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.914
I'm going home to nantes.
My leave's immi-nantes!

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.200
Aren't you funny!

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.578
Give me a beer.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:15.917
I'll be back Monday morning
in time to pack my bags.

01:15:16.053 --> 01:15:18.044
Then it's so long, rochefort.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:29.514
Someone butchered a dame
by the chateau in etiquette Lane

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:37.155
a wicker basket found today
contained the pieces of pélagie rosier

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:43.695
ex-folies bergere chorine
and one-time beauty queen

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:50.418
aged 60, she won hurrahs
under her stage name Lola-Lola

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:58.711
she nailed audiences to their seat
before bringing them to their feet

01:15:58.971 --> 01:16:04.307
the baskets open, the case is foo
police won't say if there's a clue

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:12.273
no stone will be left unturned
until the slasher's name is learned

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:17.437
ever heard of Lola-Lola?

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.814
I've never known any dancers.

01:16:22.453 --> 01:16:24.239
Here comes Josette.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:27.492
What kept you?

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:33.332
There was a police cordon
near school where I left your son

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:40.214
a sadist's on the loose
some think he's a mystical recluse

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:47.350
everyone's in an uproar
it seems he used an ax or a saw

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:53.936
he cut her into bits
and laid her out like a puzzle kit

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:57.567
it was all impeccable,
the feet below

01:16:57.696 --> 01:17:00.654
horrors! No/

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:08.321
they say they'll get the man
we must remain as calm as we can

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:13.835
- I'll have a look, then catch my train
- He's on immi/-nantes leave!

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:17.375
Until monaay - your gear

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:21.376
good-bye, friends - bon voyage

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:35.728
- A rotten crime, a filthy skunk!
- Yet he put away the pieces in a trunk

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:56.164
- Be so good as fo move along
- Please don't get us wrong

01:17:56.297 --> 01:18:01.337
don't make us
club you on the ear

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.967
the blood came out to here

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:08.640
it was a sweet old
white-haired sister

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:13.720
- it boggles the mind
- Blonds are my kind

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:18.065
well, thanks a lot, mister

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.900
don't get angry I prefer blonds

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:26.695
but it's not because
your hair's red

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:31.161
that I'd take an ax to your head

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:35.621
- would the sadist be you?
- Heavens, no. And you?

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:41.460
- Teach music is what I like to do
- Abstract art is my conceit

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:48.134
but my ambition's more concrete:
I'm looking for the ideal woman

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:54.135
I did a painting of her though
come see it at my studio

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:59.432
- we can maybe do a seance
- Good old maxence!

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:04.820
- How d'you know my name?
- Mom mentioned it when you came

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:10.326
yesterday fo the cafe
I'm solange garnier

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:14.993
- ah, you're the twin, right?
- You might be more polite

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.909
- where're you headed?
- Train to catch

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:23.460
I'm off to nantes
my leave's immi-nantes

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:31.507
that didn't make you laugh one bit
that's bargainbasement wit

01:19:31.684 --> 01:19:34.175
don't take it out on me

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:38.016
so long another time, maybe

01:19:46.407 --> 01:19:48.363
Excuse me, sir

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:51.609
I'm looking
for a certain piano store

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:55.868
- I never buy any
- But that's plain silly!

01:19:56.583 --> 01:20:00.747
Fainting"s more in my chords
I play on canvas, not keyboards

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:07.004
well, music is my line
but I think painting, too, is fine

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:13.507
I'll tell you what I think
you and I are in the pink

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:18.769
I've really got to run
[Ve got a train at 1.00

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:23.182
my leave is immi-nantes

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:26.276
immi-nanites leave'

01:20:26.447 --> 01:20:28.608
that's one I can't believe!

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:37.029
Sorry, miss - excuse me, sir

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.906
[I'm so remiss

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:41.204
let me help are you hurt?

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:46.877
No, but if you're in a rush,
no heed to make a fuss

01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:51.215
I don't mean to be a pain

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:56.674
but I've been searching in vain
for a guy named dame

01:20:56.894 --> 01:21:01.137
who has a piano store

01:21:02.107 --> 01:21:03.938
what a silly name!

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.441
- Nice man, though
- I don't say no

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:11.773
- but it's funny all the same
- That's not why I came

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:16.611
a name tells you nothing
it's like a face

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.496
[ may look dumb,
but I'm no basket case

01:21:19.666 --> 01:21:24.956
it's not that I'm so giddy
['Ve been on a shopping spree

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:29.464
but I'm a nice girl at heart

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:35.130
oh, yes, you're looking for
your friend's music store

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:39.968
tum left here
then take the second right

01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.438
thanks for the precious tip

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:50.061
sorry, I have to run
I have an appointment at 1:00

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:14.919
- Hi, pumpkin! What's that there?
- Nothing, just a tear

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:20.345
- why all the boxes?
- Our costumes, fit for a queen

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:24.853
- quick! Let me see!
- So simple, they suitus toa t

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:27.439
- nifty! - Naughty!
- I'm hungry!

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:33.195
- We're going, just wait a minute more
- Won't we look a bit like whores?

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:37.779
Funny, the idea
never occurred to me

01:23:26.251 --> 01:23:28.162
Hello, Mr. dame.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.927
Yes...?

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.179
Don't you recognize me?

01:23:41.391 --> 01:23:43.757
I'm afraid, sir...

01:23:44.144 --> 01:23:45.600
Andy!

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.395
I'll be damned!
I'm unforgivable.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:50.689
Why, I often think of you.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:53.650
I even wrote
to your Paris agent yesterday.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.737
- Have I changed that much?
- Not at all.

01:23:57.908 --> 01:24:01.992
But I never expected to see you
in my shop after all these years.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:05.909
Ten years. - Yep, ten years.

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:11.960
It's nice here. Peaceful.

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:13.958
You live alone?

01:24:15.217 --> 01:24:16.548
What about Yvonne?

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.755
She never came back.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:22.137
But why this honor?

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:24.765
I'm on a concert tour of Europe.

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:28.135
I was in Paris yesterday
and thought of you.

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:32.431
My agent told me you were here,
so here I am.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.975
I'm so glad to see you.

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:37.853
I really admire your work.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:42.032
What success! Truly fabulous.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:46.829
Even during conservatory days
your talent was obvious.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.162
You knew what you wanted,
and you got it.

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:53.160
That's true.

01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:58.173
When I was a boy,
I dreamed of conquering the world

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.961
in my thoughts,
notes and scales swirled

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:05.510
for me, a piano chord
had infinite charm

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:10.223
for a fortissimo
I'd have given my right arm

01:25:10.397 --> 01:25:14.060
for a symphony
/'d have sold my brother

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:17.397
for a melody
1d have betrayed my mother

01:25:17.571 --> 01:25:20.904
music was my whole life, you see

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:25.613
and no person
could get through to me

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:31.832
today I have everything
I yearned for

01:25:32.336 --> 01:25:37.376
fame, talent, money, and more

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:42.543
I'm flattereq,
worshipped, dehumanized

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:47.594
stupidity has left me
demoralized

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:52.936
I'd have liked
fo fight for true treasures

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:56.728
/'d sacrifice it all
for tender pleasures

01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:00.569
I didn't have love,
but love is here today

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:05.824
every since
that girl came my way

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:14.454
can she be far?
Is she near to me?

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:20.423
I never saw her again
but I know now she exists

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:26.341
is she chaste?
Or does she live fast and free?

01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:31.676
Her virtue means nothing
because I am an artist

01:26:31.937 --> 01:26:38.604
and love is the sole authority

01:26:41.113 --> 01:26:43.729
so you're disappointed
and in love?

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:47.733
Not disappointed,
but wise and in love.

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:51.361
For all that,
will you stay in rochefort?

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:53.910
I can't.
I play in Paris tomorrow.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.533
But I'll be back next week.

01:26:56.962 --> 01:27:00.125
I must find that girl.

01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:02.205
Maybe you know her?

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:04.708
There are lots
of pretty girls here.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.637
So you wrote to me?

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:11.886
Yes, about a young friend...

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:15.594
An admirer
who'd like to meet you.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.517
She writes music.

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:21.141
I'll say no more.
But you can help her. She deserves it.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.401
- Are you in love?
- Maybe.

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.111
- Pretty?
- Much more.

01:27:25.323 --> 01:27:26.984
Wow!

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:30.408
I'm so thrilled to see you.

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:34.155
Listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

01:28:18.001 --> 01:28:19.992
I've heard that somewhere.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:23.203
Nice, isn't it?

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.372
Very.

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:33.388
I've heard it somewhere before.

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.390
But where?

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:55.027
- That's odd! Where's my concerto?
- You had it today, indeed a while ago.

01:28:55.163 --> 01:29:00.078
But I put it in the usual place,
between my lipstick and eyeglass case.

01:29:04.130 --> 01:29:08.715
Here comes subtil dutrouz.
You've all met. Have a seat, do.

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:18.095
- I don't believe I know these girls.
- I spoke of them.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:20.223
They're my twin pearls.

01:29:20.355 --> 01:29:22.812
I believe we've met someplace.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:25.023
No, I never forget a face.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:31.613
Upon my word, I've seen you somewhere
unless there's a double of you out there.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:35.109
- Delphine is a dancer.
- Doubtless, I'm wrong.

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:39.530
Solange is well versed in music
and song. You're just in time.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:44.414
But before you partake,
do us the honors and cut the cake.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:46.753
I wouldn't know how.

01:29:46.882 --> 01:29:48.372
Are you being modest?

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:51.379
I shan't decline if you insist.

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.467
Please do, dutrouz.

01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:01.510
- Maxence isn't here, alas.
- He went home on a weekend pass.

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:05.852
He called his leave “immi-nantes.”
I had a good laugh.

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:09.272
- The pun's inelegant.
- Who's this joker?

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:13.773
A painter-poet.
A sailor who can do a portrait.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:15.990
Does he love me?

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:19.494
It's anyone's guess.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:22.114
I drink to your love and success.

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:27.711
To old times, so exotic!
Salonica! We met there, in aeronautics.

01:30:27.839 --> 01:30:34.335
We met in cherbourg, in front of a bar.
He'd been thrown out, drunk as a tar.

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:39.723
At the time, life was no joke.
I'd lost my job and was flat broke.

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:41.091
I got drunk.

01:30:41.227 --> 01:30:43.684
- What a downer!
- Don't be a snot!

01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:46.096
- Don't scratch.
- So what?

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:50.187
Hands on the table!
Enough champagne! He's unbearable!

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:57.358
- I'm sure we've met somewhere before.
- We haven't. Don't insist anymore.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:03.030
- Let the gentleman finish his story.
- Things weren't hunky-dory.

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:08.453
I roamed through cherbourg aimlessly
after spending six months at sea.

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:14.884
I knew a hairdresser in cherbourg, aime.
He married a certain mme desnoyers.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:22.550
A widow from tours, or was it Orleans?
She was a mother, a one-time chorine.

01:31:22.852 --> 01:31:24.217
I don't know her.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:28.013
No, it was nantes, it seems.

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:31.687
- Is there any ice cream?
- Be quiet.

01:31:32.237 --> 01:31:34.728
The dinner's a bit dull.

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:40.321
How about a spectacle?
Do a number from your show.

01:31:40.495 --> 01:31:44.989
- Without a piano, no.
- I'm feeling a bit out of tune.

01:31:45.166 --> 01:31:48.124
- I haven't seen your stage costume.
- Tomorrow.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:53.748
But I won't be at the fair.
I'm open on Sundays. I'm stuck here.

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:56.128
Leaving, then?

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:59.253
Alas, all good things
come to an end.

01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:05.930
- We're off as well. We start at dawn.
- Don't get up. We're going, we're gone.

01:32:13.778 --> 01:32:19.523
- Booboo's sleeping the sleep of the just.
- With the bottle he drank, he must!

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:24.949
The sandman's gone a bit insane.
He sprinkled booboo with champagne.

01:32:30.003 --> 01:32:31.959
Good night, dears.

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:40.669
How do I get this one
up the stairs?

01:32:56.237 --> 01:33:00.150
Sunday

01:37:01.899 --> 01:37:04.436
Ride, ride, ride!

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:08.608
Ride on air.
No stress, no cares.

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:11.568
For all tastes. At all prices.

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:33.386
- I messed up my eyes!
- They're fine.

01:37:33.556 --> 01:37:35.672
Have you seen my glove?

01:37:36.476 --> 01:37:37.761
You're on.

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:41.348
I can't go on with one glove.
Here it is!

01:37:41.606 --> 01:37:43.187
Hurry up.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:53.615
And now, it's our pleasure
to present the garnier sisters!

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:58.786
Here they are,
the famous garnier sisters!

01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:13.381
When the summer is gone,
when the seasons move on

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:19.717
when the leaves die and fall,
we only sigh about it all

01:38:19.977 --> 01:38:26.018
but to bring back a summers aay
when the cold is here to stay

01:38:26.359 --> 01:38:30.978
and your heart's in a pall,
all you have to do is love

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:36.032
love your life, love the flowers
love to laugh, love to cry

01:38:36.202 --> 01:38:40.241
love the day, love the night
[Ove the sunshine and showers

01:38:40.373 --> 01:38:44.207
love the cold, love the wind
love the cities and the fields

01:38:44.335 --> 01:38:49.125
love the sea, love the flames
love the world and be happy again

01:38:49.257 --> 01:38:55.253
when love has gone and died
and there's a chill in your heart

01:38:55.388 --> 01:39:01.554
you swear never again to start,
and all you do is cry

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:07.807
but if love's to return
and your heart is to burn

01:39:08.192 --> 01:39:13.528
though everything's tacitum,
you've got to love

01:39:31.007 --> 01:39:36.968
When you've found new delight,
when you feel your heart's might

01:39:37.096 --> 01:39:43.137
and love is back in sight,
each aay is a summers day

01:39:43.269 --> 01:39:49.390
so with new joys in store
and summer at your door

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:54.895
and love as your servitor,
you've got to sing

01:39:55.031 --> 01:39:59.149
sing of love, sing of flowers
sing of laughter and tears

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:03.616
sing of day, sing of night
sing of rain and sunlight

01:41:31.127 --> 01:41:34.415
- Talk about stage fright!
- It went all right.

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:37.209
It came undone here.

01:41:37.383 --> 01:41:39.169
A guy to 800 mea th

01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:41.334
- no, delphine.
- Who is it?

01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:42.755
He didn't say.

01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:45.129
Well, we got applause.

01:41:45.308 --> 01:41:48.345
Not quite the Asian shimmy,
but it's got charm.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:49.759
Enough out of you.

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:53.179
Go find your shimmiers,
you boors!

01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:55.977
Oh, it's you.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:57.350
Disappointed?

01:42:00.781 --> 01:42:01.987
Yes.

01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:06.409
I saw your act.
I came to say you've made progress.

01:42:06.537 --> 01:42:08.448
And apart from the flattery?

01:42:08.581 --> 01:42:12.540
If you wanted,
I could make you a star.

01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:16.123
Come with me.

01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:18.458
I'm going to Paris.

01:42:18.633 --> 01:42:21.716
A lovely girl like you -
needs a man like you.

01:42:21.844 --> 01:42:24.836
I love how you think
on your feet.

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.008
I never want to see you again.

01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:28.885
You'll regret it.

01:42:33.898 --> 01:42:35.980
What about my painter?

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:39.772
Transferred to Germany.
Thanks to me, dear heart.

01:43:00.257 --> 01:43:02.714
Delphine... my sister.

01:43:04.762 --> 01:43:07.003
- [T was wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:43:07.181 --> 01:43:08.967
Really, I mean it.

01:43:09.892 --> 01:43:12.053
You're leaving tomorrow? - Yes.

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:14.268
These gentlemen
will take us to Paris.

01:43:18.359 --> 01:43:20.395
I saw my friend Andy.

01:43:20.528 --> 01:43:24.271
He came here to see me.
He's going back to Paris.

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:29.033
He's fallen in love
with a girl he saw here.

01:43:29.286 --> 01:43:32.198
It's a long story.

01:43:32.998 --> 01:43:36.206
I told him about you.

01:43:36.335 --> 01:43:38.451
You can go see him in Paris.

01:43:38.587 --> 01:43:40.077
Thank you.

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:42.455
That was kind of you.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.882
It's only natural.

01:43:46.137 --> 01:43:48.253
Good-bye, gentlemen.

01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:51.467
Bye, girls. - Bye, Mr. dame.

01:43:52.143 --> 01:43:53.553
Good luck.

01:43:54.812 --> 01:43:57.303
- Don't stay there.
- We in the way?

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.182
We'd like to change.
Turn around.

01:44:03.571 --> 01:44:06.233
- We have something to say.
- Make it quick.

01:44:06.365 --> 01:44:08.151
Can we draw these?

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:13.285
We're waiting.

01:44:14.707 --> 01:44:18.199
Here goes:
Etienne and I love you.

01:44:18.335 --> 01:44:20.951
And we love you too. Don't we?

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.540
Sure we do.

01:44:22.673 --> 01:44:25.756
Can one of you pass me my jeans?

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:30.674
- We mean romantically.
- What?

01:44:30.806 --> 01:44:33.843
- We're in love with you.
- What are they talking about?

01:44:34.018 --> 01:44:36.555
So we want to sleep with you.

01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:37.767
What?

01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:41.139
It's normal when you're in love.

01:44:41.275 --> 01:44:44.733
- That explains the ride?
- We'll take the train.

01:44:46.197 --> 01:44:48.939
You're not very accommodating.

01:44:49.784 --> 01:44:51.695
We know your type.

01:44:51.869 --> 01:44:56.863
Always the same old tune,
always the same soft sell

01:44:57.416 --> 01:45:02.786
always the man who will
lake you to a hotel... why?

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:08.048
Never “I love you”
never “I'll be true”

01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:14.180
never a billet doux
as gentlemen used to do

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.721
always the same refrain,
always the quick fling

01:45:17.937 --> 01:45:21.521
always a love in vain
never leading to anything

01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:24.181
why? Oh why?

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:26.934
Never fine sentimenis

01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:30.188
never a romantic urge

01:45:30.407 --> 01:45:35.652
never a moment intense
or a lyrical surge

01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:40.703
always guys on the run,
always the one-night stand

01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:45.586
always up before the sun
and off with a wave of the hand

01:45:45.714 --> 01:45:50.424
always the passion that cools,
always the bad aftertaste

01:45:50.594 --> 01:45:54.633
always the feeling of haste,
the heart playing the fool

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:57.427
oh why? Why do you sigh for us?

01:45:57.601 --> 01:45:59.933
Why do you take us to bed?

01:46:00.104 --> 01:46:04.438
Why say you'd die for us
but never promise to wed?

01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:09.193
- Why get so upset?
- Why lecture us like this?

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:13.982
But fo end the féte
can we give you a kiss?

01:46:15.286 --> 01:46:16.571
Okay?

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:19.612
Okay

01:46:25.546 --> 01:46:29.505
- Still coming tomorrow?
- If you promise to behave.

01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:33.171
- We'll try.
- Then we're coming.

01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:37.304
- Meet us here at noon.
- See you tomorrow.

01:46:49.111 --> 01:46:53.605
- Always the same refrain
- Always the letdown

01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:58.572
- always telling us no
- Never is the answer yes... oh, why?

01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:01.696
Always those promises

01:47:02.166 --> 01:47:05.283
but tomorrow never comes

01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:08.502
we never have a chance

01:47:08.631 --> 01:47:12.374
we really look dumb

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:14.132
why?

01:47:56.595 --> 01:48:00.884
Monday morning

01:48:02.768 --> 01:48:04.599
postman!

01:48:06.063 --> 01:48:08.429
Hurry. You'll be late.

01:48:09.817 --> 01:48:11.557
Hurry, booboo.

01:48:14.613 --> 01:48:16.444
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, mom.

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:27.573
- A cup of coffee.
- Make it two.

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:30.667
- Leaving already?
- We'll be back.

01:48:30.838 --> 01:48:33.124
- Taking my girls?
- We meet at noon.

01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:34.872
Be careful.

01:48:35.384 --> 01:48:38.217
Was the fair a success?
A huge one.

01:48:38.345 --> 01:48:40.506
- And my girls?
- A triumph!

01:48:44.268 --> 01:48:47.726
They made the front page!
With a photo!

01:48:47.855 --> 01:48:50.221
“Twins launch their own gemini.”

01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.015
What's that mean?

01:48:58.115 --> 01:49:00.572
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:03.317
Look, it's dutrouz!

01:49:03.495 --> 01:49:06.532
“Sadist hid murder weapon at home.”

01:49:10.002 --> 01:49:11.913
That's dutrouz, all right.

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.042
They forgot the z.
He'll lose his head.

01:49:16.258 --> 01:49:18.544
If he holds on to it.

01:49:19.261 --> 01:49:21.252
How about that!

01:49:21.388 --> 01:49:23.003
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:27.391
We have to go by the hotel,
then finish loading.

01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:31.978
And that fuss
about cutting the cake!

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:33.730
Wicked man!

01:49:37.029 --> 01:49:39.395
Good-bye, and bon voyage.

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:42.615
If you're ever
in rochefort, stop by.

01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:52.916
True, there's trouble everywhere.

01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:56.332
Dutrouz...

01:49:57.007 --> 01:49:58.668
The rat!

01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:06.213
11:30 already!

01:50:12.648 --> 01:50:16.937
- I've come for my lesson.
- School's closed for good.

01:50:18.487 --> 01:50:21.570
- Who was it?
- The dumont girl, for her lesson.

01:50:21.782 --> 01:50:23.192
At this hour!

01:50:23.367 --> 01:50:25.028
It's 11:30.

01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:26.962
I didn't cancel!
We'll never make it bv noon!
