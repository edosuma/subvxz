ANDRE: Good evening,
my lords and ladies!

01:30.043 --> 01:33.450
Perhaps I can interest
you in a fair ditty.

01:33.570 --> 01:39.920
Now, I play for my heart, but I
don't mind a ha'penny or two.

getting a lot better.

01:45.182 --> 01:46.765
Yeah, the lessons
have helped, yeah.

01:46.885 --> 01:47.850
You made him take lessons?

01:47.970 --> 01:50.218
I just told him his punishment
was he had to play the flute.

01:50.338 --> 01:52.365
He took the lessons on his own.

01:54.734 --> 01:56.113
Oh, no, turn around.

01:56.233 --> 01:56.899
Got to keep going.

01:57.019 --> 01:58.031
Work the finish.

01:58.151 --> 01:59.549
Do the kicks.

02:02.681 --> 02:05.155
Ah, your horseless carriage.

02:05.275 --> 02:07.257
Oh, that girl looks terrified.

02:07.922 --> 02:11.344
It's definitely less creepy when
you follow them onto the bus.

02:12.394 --> 02:15.677
I'll be here all week!

02:20.872 --> 02:23.522
The good news is you're becoming
one heck of a flute player.

02:23.642 --> 02:26.160
Uh, it is flautist,
thank you very much.

02:26.280 --> 02:30.160
And you would know, from all your years
of playing the skin flute down here.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.077
You just have to put your
fingers up here now.

02:32.197 --> 02:33.443
It's the skin flaut, though.

02:33.563 --> 02:36.413
And when is this Sacko punishment
going to actually end, all right?

02:36.533 --> 02:38.304
You know the deal, Andre.

02:38.424 --> 02:41.152

Now, Andre, do you see yourself
more as like a rapist

02:51.600 --> 02:54.502
who does magic, or a magician
who also likes to rape?

02:54.504 --> 02:55.269
Big distinction.

02:55.271 --> 02:57.204
Well, with me magic
always comes first.

02:57.206 --> 02:57.805
Of course. Of course.

02:57.807 --> 02:58.539

Yeah.

03:07.213 --> 03:08.513
We would have been the
real losers here.

This guy would have been

to step it up a notch.

I wish that I could take out the
Shiva every day and show it to

03:19.925 --> 03:23.427
you pathetic, also-ran,
shit sippers, but I can't.

03:23.429 --> 03:24.861
What did you do to the Shiva?

03:24.863 --> 03:25.862
I didn't touch the Shiva.

03:25.864 --> 03:26.863
What did you do to the Dre?

03:26.865 --> 03:28.098
I will never touch the Dre.

Whoa.

03:32.705 --> 03:34.105
It says "Shiva Champ."

03:34.107 --> 03:36.073
It says "Suck it" on
the side, though.

Ow!

03:37.076 --> 03:38.175

One ring to find them, and

03:57.565 --> 03:59.298
You are Sauron.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.134
Hell are you talking about?

04:01.136 --> 04:02.435
Uh, <i>Lord of the Rings?</i>

<i>Use... a... plate.</i>

06:35.161 --> 06:37.096
<i>Okay.</i>

06:41.854 --> 06:44.311
All right, let's pick the draft
order and get things things going.

06:44.431 --> 06:45.456
Let's do it.
Really?

06:46.357 --> 06:47.923
This is what you have prepared?

06:47.925 --> 06:48.924
Names out of a hat?

06:48.926 --> 06:50.359
I'm not here to
entertain you guys.

06:50.361 --> 06:51.760
This is about
winning this year.

06:51.762 --> 06:52.894
I'm streamlining the process.

06:52.896 --> 06:53.895
Besides, this isn't a hat.

06:53.897 --> 06:58.031
This is a... It's a cobra box that I
brought back from India-- the country.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.133
Exactly.

06:59.135 --> 07:02.302
Are we waiting for Ruxin, or...
No, we have a quorum.

07:02.304 --> 07:03.303
Let's get this done.

07:03.305 --> 07:05.039
I have an appointment
with Anton my barber.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.207
All right.

07:06.209 --> 07:12.313
The first person to pick in the
2011 draft will be... Let's get it.

07:12.315 --> 07:13.715
It's gonna be good.

07:13.717 --> 07:16.050
Okay.

07:17.353 --> 07:18.587
Ruxin.

07:18.589 --> 07:19.654
(all groaning)

07:19.656 --> 07:20.322
Oh, man.

07:20.324 --> 07:22.256
Come on.

07:22.258 --> 07:27.761
So the first pick in the
2011 draft goes to...

07:31.398 --> 07:32.332
Wait.

07:32.334 --> 07:34.334
No, no, we're not going to do...
Yeah.

07:34.336 --> 07:35.101
We should do this.

07:35.103 --> 07:35.968
This is very simple.

07:35.970 --> 07:39.572
Okay, we just say, Hey, Ruxin,
you pick, like, fifth.

07:39.574 --> 07:44.743
And it'll be totally fine as long as
one of us is drafting after him.

07:44.745 --> 07:45.744
Right?

07:45.746 --> 07:46.312
Oh, oh, no.

07:46.314 --> 07:48.113
Yeah, well, that
seems appropriate.

07:48.115 --> 07:49.115
Me?

07:49.117 --> 07:50.917
Yeah, it'll be your
last Sacko punishment.

07:50.919 --> 07:51.951
Okay, here we go.

07:51.953 --> 07:53.352
First pick in the draft.

07:53.354 --> 07:54.353
Goes to... (snap)

07:54.355 --> 07:56.289
Because we haven't
picked anything yet.

07:56.291 --> 07:56.956
Ow, ow.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.123
Taco, my finger's caught.

07:58.125 --> 07:58.857
Are you serious?

07:58.859 --> 08:00.626
It's kind of...
It's pinching a little bit.

08:00.628 --> 08:01.761
Yeah, it's a cobra box.

08:01.763 --> 08:02.762
It's a finger lock.

08:02.764 --> 08:05.097
It's not coming...
It won't come off.

08:05.099 --> 08:06.098
Ow!

08:06.100 --> 08:08.300
It hurts so bad
when I pull hard!

08:08.302 --> 08:10.302
Oh good, that means
it's authentic.

08:10.304 --> 08:13.605
And last but not least...
we have Chuck.

08:13.607 --> 08:14.306
All right... Mr. Chuck.

08:14.308 --> 08:15.874
And, uh... That's that.

08:15.876 --> 08:17.876
All right, we're good?

08:17.878 --> 08:18.844
Everybody good?

08:18.846 --> 08:20.045
Don't tell him anything.

08:20.047 --> 08:21.280
Absolutely.

08:21.282 --> 08:22.815
Someone at the door.

08:22.817 --> 08:23.949
Whoa.

08:23.951 --> 08:27.554
I'm really sorry that I'm late,
but I was getting my ring fitted.

08:27.556 --> 08:28.655
Look at that.

08:28.657 --> 08:30.524
Wait, what happened
to your wedding ring?

08:30.526 --> 08:32.693
Oh, today I'm
besotted to to Shiva.

08:32.695 --> 08:34.693
It's kind of an
anniversary for us.

08:34.696 --> 08:38.065
And, uh, let us now
pick the draft order.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.133
Actually, we're all set.

08:39.135 --> 08:39.832
We already picked it.

08:39.835 --> 08:41.835
You already picked
the draft order?

08:41.837 --> 08:42.336
Yeah.

08:42.337 --> 08:44.638
Without your reigning
champion here?

08:44.640 --> 08:47.073
We had a quorum, so... A quorum?

08:47.075 --> 08:47.907
Yep.

08:47.909 --> 08:50.077
And what-what pick did
I get in the draft?

08:50.079 --> 08:50.743
You did okay.

08:50.745 --> 08:51.644
You ended up fifth.

08:51.646 --> 08:52.345
Fifth?!

08:52.347 --> 08:54.348
I got fourth, you got
fifth, he got sixth.

08:54.350 --> 08:55.282
I hate it.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.517
I'm behind you. Man.

08:56.519 --> 08:58.252
All right, great, so I got
fifth pick in the draft?

08:58.254 --> 08:58.819
Mm-hmm.

08:58.821 --> 08:59.753
Great. All right, cool.

08:59.755 --> 09:02.022
Oh, wait, hold on!

09:02.024 --> 09:04.558
This is bullshit.

09:04.560 --> 09:05.559
The fix is in.

09:05.561 --> 09:06.293
Here it comes.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.496
I think what happened is, you
decided to start without me.

09:09.498 --> 09:11.732
Then you picked my name out
of the hat first, and you

09:11.734 --> 09:13.200
thought, let's start over.

09:13.202 --> 09:16.603
But to make it seem natural,
we'll put him, like, fifth, and

09:16.605 --> 09:19.307
we'll stick a patsy like Andre
behind him at sixth...

09:19.309 --> 09:20.742
Take your hand off his leg.

09:20.744 --> 09:24.612
After that, we'll let Pete take
the lead, 'cause he's a liar.

09:24.614 --> 09:27.882
Jenny can back him up,
'cause she's a sociopath.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.918
And then we'll let the other
three lemmings keep their act

09:29.920 --> 09:32.621
together as long as they can
without exploding with the

09:32.623 --> 09:36.090
shame of diarrhea that is
currently soaking their pants.

09:36.092 --> 09:37.958
We did not cheat.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.326
Kevin, did you guys cheat?

09:39.328 --> 09:40.527
We did not cheat.

09:40.529 --> 09:41.795
Andre?

09:41.797 --> 09:43.296
We didn't lie to you, man.

09:43.298 --> 09:46.099
Why don't you put the guns
away, anorexic David Crosby.

09:46.101 --> 09:49.135
Let me be very clear
about something.

09:49.137 --> 09:52.338
If I find out that you are
lying, and I will, I swear on

09:52.340 --> 09:59.112
Shiva that this whole
season will be suspect.

09:59.114 --> 10:01.348
Unless I win.

10:01.350 --> 10:05.818
So pile into your clown car of lies,
'cause you're all going down.

10:05.820 --> 10:09.622
(imitates car
horn): Lies, lies.

10:09.624 --> 10:12.125
(humming circus music)

10:14.129 --> 10:16.631
Wow, he just figured out the
whole damn thing from beginning

10:16.633 --> 10:18.066
to end like he was in the room.

10:18.068 --> 10:19.100
Let's just bring him back.

10:19.102 --> 10:20.234
Let's just pick again.

10:20.236 --> 10:21.169
Kevin, no.

10:21.171 --> 10:22.603
That admits that we were lying.

10:22.605 --> 10:23.905
We're too deep, man.

10:23.907 --> 10:24.839
Andre, it's Ruxin.

10:24.841 --> 10:25.774
We'll laugh about it.

10:25.776 --> 10:30.279
He'll appreciate the fact that we tried to
tell him that the truth... Quiet! Hm?

10:30.281 --> 10:32.381
Yeah, yeah.

10:32.383 --> 10:33.382
Here's the deal.

10:33.384 --> 10:36.385
We can never say a
word of this to Ruxin.

10:36.387 --> 10:37.286
Never ever.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.855
Let's make it official.

10:38.857 --> 10:40.156
Blood oath.

10:40.158 --> 10:41.958
Kevin, give me your penis.

10:41.960 --> 10:43.693
No!

10:43.695 --> 10:45.361
Hey.

10:45.363 --> 10:46.396
Hey.

10:46.398 --> 10:49.399
So, uh, I saw what you
were doing out there.

10:49.401 --> 10:50.634
What?

10:50.636 --> 10:52.870
You're using the dog training
book on your husband.

10:52.872 --> 10:53.937
What?!

10:53.939 --> 10:55.540
Yeah, right.

10:55.542 --> 10:56.641
Maybe a little bit.

10:56.643 --> 10:58.309
I've been training him
for years, all right?

10:58.311 --> 10:59.543
I just use a different method.

10:59.545 --> 11:01.178
(pen clicking)

11:01.180 --> 11:02.179
What?

11:02.181 --> 11:03.180
Hey, Kevin.

11:03.182 --> 11:04.181
Hey.

11:04.183 --> 11:05.950
Would you grab me a beer please?

11:05.952 --> 11:08.318
Yeah, what am I, like, Mr.
Belvedere or something?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.019
Get your own beer.

11:09.021 --> 11:10.353
(pen clicking)

11:10.355 --> 11:11.988
What-what-what do you want?

11:11.990 --> 11:13.023
A Bud Lite, please.

11:13.025 --> 11:15.358
Oh, well, I don't know if I
have one, but I'll check.

11:15.360 --> 11:17.127
How long has this been going on?

11:17.129 --> 11:17.994
Oh, since college.

11:17.996 --> 11:19.362
Well, it stops now.

11:19.364 --> 11:20.230
Do you hear me?

11:20.232 --> 11:21.231
There's one alpha dog here.

11:21.233 --> 11:22.365
It's me.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.133
There you go.

11:23.135 --> 11:24.001
Thank you so much, man.

11:24.003 --> 11:26.370
Appreciate it.

11:31.715 --> 11:33.216
What are we doing in
a public library?

11:33.218 --> 11:34.584
I got a plan to cheer you up.

11:34.586 --> 11:35.986
And that is at Andre's expense.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.487
RAFI: Oh, shit!

11:37.489 --> 11:39.189
What's up, jerks?

11:39.191 --> 11:44.027
(groans): Oh...
My esteemed colleague.

11:44.029 --> 11:45.228
I am day drunk.

11:45.230 --> 11:47.665
Get ready to see my dick.

11:47.667 --> 11:48.766
Brian.

11:48.768 --> 11:49.934
Lookin' good, tall guy.

11:49.936 --> 11:51.703
Up top.

11:51.705 --> 11:52.670
(goofy beeping sound)

11:52.672 --> 11:54.172
How's your child bride, Rafi?

11:54.174 --> 11:55.540
Oh, deported.

11:55.542 --> 11:58.143
Turns out you can't keep a
14-year-old you married in

11:58.145 --> 12:01.180
Mexico, even if you bought her fair
and square and have the receipt.

12:01.182 --> 12:03.182
I-I can't...
What are we doing here?

12:03.184 --> 12:07.119
I don't want to... Look, guys, Rafi is
going to help us with the final Sacko

12:07.121 --> 12:08.420
punishment for Andre.

12:08.422 --> 12:11.156
We're going to banish Andre from
his loft, and while he's gone...

12:11.158 --> 12:12.758
Shoot a porno in his place.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.692
We're not making a
porno with Rafi.

12:14.694 --> 12:15.426
We're not making
a porno at all.

12:15.428 --> 12:17.195
No, no, no, no, we
aren't making any porno.

12:17.197 --> 12:18.963
We're going to leave that
to the professionals.

12:18.965 --> 12:21.198
Yeah, me and Dirty Randy.

12:23.101 --> 12:24.768
That dude who looks like
an illiterate Wolverine?

12:24.770 --> 12:25.969
Yeah.

12:25.971 --> 12:27.938
Randy, get over here.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.040
Hey. Yeah.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.975
Look at this-- sweet pukas, man.

12:31.977 --> 12:33.876
Look at these sexy dudes.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.211
Hey, how's it going?

12:35.213 --> 12:36.579
Welcome to the office.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.614
So Dirty Randy is a librarian?

12:38.616 --> 12:40.048
Mostly for the infrastructure.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.217
This is where you really find
people at the end of their rope.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.086
Desperate people, weak people.

12:44.088 --> 12:46.888
And I pay them in drugs and
alcohol and they, uh, you know,

12:46.890 --> 12:47.922
they're my production team.

12:47.924 --> 12:48.990
That's classy.

12:48.992 --> 12:50.725
These are the two, right?

12:50.727 --> 12:51.626
Those are the guys.

12:51.628 --> 12:53.160
Now here's what
I'm going to say.

12:53.162 --> 12:54.896
I think your dicks are good...
Excuse me?

12:54.898 --> 12:56.164
...but I don't like
working with couples.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.566
We're not... We're not a couple.

12:58.568 --> 13:00.968
We don't... You're not a...
Well, it doesn't matter if you're on a

13:00.970 --> 13:01.736
break or what.

13:01.738 --> 13:03.905
Like, if you guys have had sex a
lot before, which you clearly

13:03.907 --> 13:05.774
have, it's just,
there's no chemistry.

13:05.776 --> 13:07.842
If you think it's weird now,
wait till I film you guys

13:07.844 --> 13:08.776
banging each other in the ass.

13:08.778 --> 13:12.913
You, though, I'd film
the shit out of you.

13:12.915 --> 13:16.116
I thought you were in locations.

13:16.118 --> 13:17.918
I was a homeless
person for along time.

13:17.920 --> 13:18.585
Long time.

13:18.587 --> 13:19.853
Kicked out of the military.

13:19.855 --> 13:21.088
Crack dealer.

13:21.090 --> 13:22.189
Porn location scout.

13:22.191 --> 13:23.191
Director.

13:23.193 --> 13:24.825
Did you guys make
<i>Shitler's List?</i>

13:24.827 --> 13:25.760
<i>Oh, wow, you've seen it.</i>

13:25.762 --> 13:28.262
<i>You know what's amazing is, at the
time it was actually, like,</i>

13:28.264 --> 13:30.864
<i>a controversial choice to
make it in black and white.</i>

13:30.866 --> 13:34.067
<i>But, you know, cum is so white,
the cocks we were using were so</i>

13:34.069 --> 13:36.202
<i>black that they just really
complimented each other.</i>

13:36.204 --> 13:37.670
<i>It's pretty unbelievable.</i>

13:37.672 --> 13:39.205
<i>Should we start talking shop?</i>

13:39.207 --> 13:42.174
<i>Let's do this, let's
talk turkey.</i>

13:42.176 --> 13:44.109
<i>Okay, this is going
to be really simple.</i>

13:44.111 --> 13:46.612
<i>We will come to Andre's loft,
we'll do our draft, then</i>

13:46.614 --> 13:49.481
<i>we'll vacate the premises and you
guys come in, do your thing.</i>

13:49.483 --> 13:50.116
<i>Wait, what?</i>

13:50.118 --> 13:50.983
<i>Where are you going?</i>

13:50.985 --> 13:51.884
<i>Why are you going to leave?</i>

13:51.886 --> 13:52.785
<i>We don't want to watch.</i>

13:52.787 --> 13:53.686
<i>Of course, you want to watch.</i>

13:53.688 --> 13:55.054
<i>Why wouldn't you
want to to watch?</i>

13:55.056 --> 13:55.989
<i>You don't want to see sex?</i>

13:55.991 --> 13:56.656
<i>That's sick.</i>

13:56.658 --> 13:57.357
<i>Yeah, I like sex.</i>

13:57.359 --> 13:59.158
<i>I like sausage, too, but I don't
want to watch that get made.</i>

13:59.160 --> 14:01.694
<i>Our only stipulation is that
the lead character has to be</i>

14:01.696 --> 14:03.997
<i>named Dr. Andre Nowzik.</i>

14:03.999 --> 14:05.165
<i>Cockter Andre No-Dick.</i>

14:05.167 --> 14:06.166
<i>Boom.</i>

14:06.168 --> 14:09.737
<i>Hang on, how about Dr.
Andre Nose-Dick?</i>

14:09.739 --> 14:10.871
<i>That's awesome!</i>

14:10.873 --> 14:12.172
<i>And he's got a dick for a nose.</i>

14:12.174 --> 14:14.641
<i>And he bangs girls
with his nose dick.</i>

14:14.643 --> 14:16.143
<i>(both grunting)</i>

14:16.145 --> 14:17.411
<i>Ah... choo!</i>

14:17.413 --> 14:19.179
<i>And they she goes "Gesundheit."</i>

14:19.181 --> 14:19.846
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:19.848 --> 14:22.015
<i>I guess the thing is for us,
we're just not loving the puns.</i>

14:22.017 --> 14:25.252
<i>The puns are as vital to the porn
industry as they are to the</i>

14:25.254 --> 14:28.721
<i>pet shop industry and the
child hair salon industry.</i>

14:28.723 --> 14:30.056
<i>You need puns.</i>

14:30.058 --> 14:31.424
<i>My Orgy at Andre's.</i>

14:31.426 --> 14:32.392
<i>Done, that's it.</i>

14:32.394 --> 14:34.093
<i>Look at that, look at that.</i>

14:34.095 --> 14:35.995
<i>Nailed it!</i>

14:35.997 --> 14:39.598
<i>How long from getting there to
when you're done cleaning up</i>

14:39.600 --> 14:41.199
<i>is the whole process
going to take?</i>

14:41.201 --> 14:42.000
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

14:42.002 --> 14:42.767
<i>We don't clean up.</i>

14:42.769 --> 14:43.668
<i>No, we don't clean up.</i>

14:43.670 --> 14:45.136
<i>You don't clean up after you
Look, guys, what's my name?</i>

14:45.138 --> 14:46.004
<i>...make the porno?</i>

14:46.006 --> 14:47.939
<i>My name is Dirty Randy.</i>

14:47.941 --> 14:49.408
<i>You know what I do?</i>

14:49.410 --> 14:50.509
<i>I do this.</i>

14:50.511 --> 14:51.143
<i>Okay.</i>

14:51.145 --> 14:53.112
<i>And I do this.</i>

14:53.114 --> 14:54.680
<i>I do this.</i>

14:54.682 --> 14:55.948
<i>You know what I don't do?</i>

14:55.950 --> 14:57.049
<i>That.</i>

14:57.051 --> 14:59.351
<i>So this is okay, this, but this
is where we draw the line?</i>

14:59.353 --> 15:00.953
<i>We're not janitors,
we're artists.</i>

15:00.955 --> 15:01.721
<i>We're filmmakers.</i>

15:01.723 --> 15:03.156
<i>How much cleaning up
are we talking about?</i>

15:03.158 --> 15:04.157
<i>Tons.</i>

15:04.159 --> 15:05.058
<i>A lot.</i>

15:05.060 --> 15:05.459
<i>Huge.</i>

15:05.461 --> 15:07.027
<i>It's like a white rain
of a thousend loads.</i>

15:07.029 --> 15:09.096
<i>You'll basically be able to climb
the walls like Spider-Man.</i>

15:09.098 --> 15:10.731
<i>Guys, I'm sorry, but you're
going to have to clean up.</i>

15:10.733 --> 15:11.199
<i>(alarm blaring)</i>

15:11.201 --> 15:12.166
<i>What's that?</i>

15:12.168 --> 15:14.470
<i>Some asshole's trying to look at
porn on the library computer.</i>

15:14.472 --> 15:15.537
<i>Hey.</i>

15:15.539 --> 15:17.172
<i>Mr. Librarian, your
Internet's broken.</i>

15:17.174 --> 15:18.073
<i>What are you doing?</i>

15:18.075 --> 15:18.808
<i>Oh, hey, guys.</i>

15:18.810 --> 15:19.642
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

15:19.644 --> 15:21.744
<i>You're Buck from</i> <i>Sands
of</i> <i>Passion,</i> right?

15:21.746 --> 15:22.779
Yeah.

15:22.781 --> 15:23.880
How do you know this guy?

15:23.882 --> 15:25.549
He's Brian's brother.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.449
No shit?!

15:26.451 --> 15:27.450
Yeah.

15:27.452 --> 15:27.918
Yeah.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.553
You know what, I didn't realize you
guys ran in, like, celebrity circles.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.422
We're going to make
this work, work, okay?

15:32.424 --> 15:33.756
We'll split the
cleaning costs 50-50.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.189
We got a deal?

15:34.191 --> 15:35.190
All right, you got a deal.

15:35.192 --> 15:36.191
Great.

15:36.193 --> 15:38.760
All right, now we just got to
get Andre out of his apartment.

15:38.762 --> 15:41.496
So this is it, our
first draft apart.

15:41.498 --> 15:44.465
This is your final Sacko
punishment-- you are banished.

15:44.467 --> 15:47.201
Fine. I'll take my punishment
like a man. I will.

15:47.203 --> 15:49.203
Jenny, please, tell
them it's not fair.

15:49.205 --> 15:51.138
Tell them they got to take me
back-- they listen to you.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.573
Suck it, dick cream.

15:52.575 --> 15:53.907
You don't like it, get better.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.408
All right, I'll leave.

15:55.410 --> 15:57.410
What was that?
Did someone... Nothing.

15:57.412 --> 15:58.411
No one said anything.

15:58.413 --> 16:00.146
The meter's running--
get in the car.

16:00.148 --> 16:02.648
Okay, all right.

16:07.555 --> 16:10.524
Your home for the 2011 draft!

16:10.526 --> 16:12.526
Are they really gonna
shoot a porn in here?

16:12.528 --> 16:15.229
Oh, yeah, and the best part is,
Andre is gonna be living in

16:15.231 --> 16:17.665
the post-porno fallout for
weeks without even knowing it.

16:17.667 --> 16:21.169
The only way that happens is if we all
agree to keep a secret-- can we do that?

16:21.171 --> 16:22.170
What?

16:22.172 --> 16:23.638
Yes, we can.

16:23.640 --> 16:25.173
Kevin, you can keep a secret.

16:25.175 --> 16:27.175
Secret!

16:27.177 --> 16:29.945
So, this is the station where
we'll do the entire draft.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.181
Everyone will come over and
make their own individual pick.

16:32.183 --> 16:38.021
So, I was thinking of talking to
Kevin about swapping draft picks.

16:38.023 --> 16:40.022
No. Look, we just have to find
some way to divide Kevin.

16:40.024 --> 16:42.025
You guys talking
about trading Kevin?

16:42.027 --> 16:43.026
BOTH: No.

16:43.028 --> 16:46.028
'Cause I've been doing the same
thing, but on a deeper level.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.029
What?

16:47.031 --> 16:49.032
Yeah, yeah, I got him high one
time, and I hypnotized him.

16:49.034 --> 16:50.033
No, you didn't.

16:50.035 --> 16:51.535
Yeah, I high-notized him.

16:51.537 --> 16:54.038
You can't high-notize
someone, Taco.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.740
What is this?!

16:56.742 --> 16:57.741
It's the Shiva ring!

16:57.743 --> 16:58.742
Yeah.

16:58.744 --> 16:59.743
I think I'm pretty cool.

16:59.745 --> 17:01.379
Hey, you know what
else is pretty cool?

17:01.381 --> 17:03.547
How you guys totally screwed
me on the draft order.

17:03.549 --> 17:04.548
Tell me exactly what happened.

17:04.550 --> 17:05.549
We didn't do anything.

17:05.550 --> 17:07.151
We just...
we picked, that was it.

17:07.153 --> 17:09.887
You don't do morally
bankrupt, while me, I swim

17:09.888 --> 17:12.690
around in it like Scrooge
McDuck in a pile of coins.

17:12.692 --> 17:16.467
But you, you're drowning in it.

17:16.587 --> 17:18.407
(imitates car
horn): Lies, lies.

17:22.510 --> 17:23.752
Very tricky, Pete.

17:23.755 --> 17:25.121
Very tricky.

17:25.123 --> 17:26.623
Oh! Hi, Andre.

17:26.625 --> 17:27.624
How's the restaurant?

17:27.626 --> 17:28.625
What's the catch?

17:28.627 --> 17:29.626
Andre, there's no catch.

17:29.628 --> 17:32.830
Oh, sure. You send me to the best restaurant
in Chicago, and you expect me just

17:32.832 --> 17:33.831
to draft here?

17:33.833 --> 17:34.832
Exactly.

17:34.834 --> 17:37.868
You know what? I know something's up,
and you're not gonna trick me, okay?

17:37.870 --> 17:38.502
Enjoy.

17:38.504 --> 17:41.371
'Cause when you dance with
the devil, you get-- hello?

17:41.373 --> 17:42.372
How's he doing?

17:42.374 --> 17:43.373
He's freaking out.

17:43.375 --> 17:46.943
Gentlemen, Taco, the draft
will begin in a minute, but

17:46.945 --> 17:49.746
before we do, I would like to
invite you all to the roof,

17:49.748 --> 17:54.850
where we will have a ceremony to
celebrate the wonderful reign of Ruxin.

17:54.852 --> 17:57.353
(goofy voice):
Won't you join me?

17:57.355 --> 17:58.354
No, I think I won't.

17:58.356 --> 17:59.355
I'm gonna go up.

17:59.357 --> 18:00.356
Don't do it.

18:00.358 --> 18:01.357
I-I can't live like this.

18:01.359 --> 18:03.359
It's one lie after
another after another.

18:03.361 --> 18:04.894
I just feel like I
have to get it out.

18:04.896 --> 18:06.896
We'll pick again and then
we'll draft, all right?

18:06.898 --> 18:08.731
No, no, Kevin, Kevin, wait!

18:08.733 --> 18:10.900
Kevin, no! No! Kevin! Kevin!

18:10.902 --> 18:12.134
Kevin?

18:12.136 --> 18:13.335
Kevin?

18:13.337 --> 18:14.336
No!

18:14.338 --> 18:15.337
Kevin!

18:15.339 --> 18:16.338
No. No.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.339
Ruxin!

18:17.341 --> 18:18.341
Welcome.

18:18.343 --> 18:21.310
Ruxin... Pumpernickel.

18:21.312 --> 18:22.311
High-notized!

18:22.313 --> 18:23.311
What the hell?

18:23.313 --> 18:24.346
He's a lightweight.

18:24.348 --> 18:25.347
Don't worry about him.

18:25.349 --> 18:26.348
We'll shave him later.

18:26.350 --> 18:29.484
Okay, well, he's about to miss
the most shocking draft ever.

18:29.486 --> 18:33.222
One of you will receive this rose as the
object of my affection-- oh, it's me!

18:33.224 --> 18:35.224
Come on, Chris Harrison,
let's do this.

18:35.226 --> 18:37.593
Okay, now, a few small rule
changes for the upcoming season.

18:37.595 --> 18:38.860
(phone vibrating)

18:38.862 --> 18:41.529
First, no calls to the
house after 10:00.

18:41.531 --> 18:42.530
No texts, either.

18:42.532 --> 18:44.833
I want to get 'em the next
morning, I'll check my e-mail.

18:44.835 --> 18:47.903
Second, if you get a haircut and
I don't say anything, it's

18:47.905 --> 18:50.205
'cause I think you got a shitty
haircut-- so just drop it.

18:50.207 --> 18:50.839
Taco!

18:50.841 --> 18:51.840
Hi, guys. Come in.

18:51.842 --> 18:52.840
How's it going?

18:52.842 --> 18:53.441
Good, good.

18:53.443 --> 18:54.442
Wow!

18:54.444 --> 18:55.443
Thanks for coming early.

18:55.445 --> 18:56.444
We have a lot of work to do.

18:56.446 --> 18:57.445
You have everything you need?

18:57.447 --> 19:01.615
Yeah. Donkey, slave P. A....
hot chick... That works.

19:01.617 --> 19:03.250
...hot chick... Oh, hello.

19:03.252 --> 19:04.517
...Dr. Andre No-Dick.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.852
Oh, this is perfect.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.853
Hey, hey, hey.

19:06.855 --> 19:07.854
We added a gap, right?

19:07.856 --> 19:09.856
Perfect.
We're gonna need a hat later.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.124
Go find the hat closet.

19:11.126 --> 19:13.426
Now, you guys know, I know
the Middle Eastern market.

19:13.428 --> 19:14.427
Without a doubt.

19:14.429 --> 19:15.428
We've come close.

19:15.430 --> 19:18.331
Yeah. Buddy of ours is on SEAL
Team Six, put a bullet in

19:18.333 --> 19:21.868
Bin Laden, rooting around his
place finds one of our pornos.

19:21.870 --> 19:22.869
In the hideout!

19:22.871 --> 19:23.870
Bin Laden had it, yeah.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.372
Yeah. <i>Toe Bangers III.</i>

19:25.374 --> 19:26.640
<i>Which is a good one.</i>

19:26.642 --> 19:27.642
<i>No Toe Left Behind.</i>

19:27.644 --> 19:29.411
<i>That's huge publicity.</i>

19:29.413 --> 19:31.913
<i>Nope. Government won't
release any of the footage.</i>

19:31.915 --> 19:32.914
<i>None of the titles.</i>

19:32.916 --> 19:35.718
<i>All that publicity just essentially
wasted, flushed down</i>

19:35.720 --> 19:36.885
<i>the toilet!</i>

19:36.887 --> 19:38.888
<i>Don't invite me to
join LinkedIn.</i>

19:38.890 --> 19:41.891
<i>It just reeks of dudes
with cell phone holsters.</i>

19:41.893 --> 19:42.491
<i>Hey.</i>

19:42.493 --> 19:43.492
<i>What hap... Where am I?</i>

19:43.494 --> 19:44.493
<i>Nothing happened.</i>

19:44.495 --> 19:45.127
<i>You're fine.</i>

19:45.129 --> 19:47.129
<i>Do we all agree to
these changes?</i>

19:47.131 --> 19:48.130
<i>OTHERS: Yeah. Sure.</i>

19:48.132 --> 19:48.764
<i>Say "aye."</i>

19:48.766 --> 19:50.299
<i>OTHERS: Aye. I...'m bored.</i>

19:50.301 --> 19:52.267
<i>Okay. L...et's go draft!</i>

19:52.269 --> 19:53.602
<i>Thank you. God!</i>

19:53.604 --> 19:56.671
<i>Jesus Christ, it's about time.</i>

19:56.673 --> 19:57.638
<i>Open it.</i>

19:57.640 --> 19:58.940
<i>Uh, it's... it's locked.</i>

19:58.942 --> 20:00.574
<i>Last looks, final touches.</i>

20:00.576 --> 20:01.575
<i>We're ready?</i>

20:01.577 --> 20:02.643
<i>Lock it up!</i>

20:02.645 --> 20:04.946
<i>My Orgy at Andre's,</i> take one.

20:04.948 --> 20:07.248
And... action.

20:07.250 --> 20:10.618
I'm so tired from such a long
day of terrible doctoring.

20:10.620 --> 20:13.921
Hello... Dr. No-Dick.

20:13.923 --> 20:16.758
What are you doing here in my...
metrosexual loft?

20:16.760 --> 20:17.759
Nice furniture, by the way.

20:17.761 --> 20:18.759
Thank you.

20:18.761 --> 20:21.362
I was overcharged by
a interior designer.

20:21.364 --> 20:23.197
I was waiting for you.

20:23.199 --> 20:24.631
Maybe I can fit you in.

20:24.633 --> 20:28.268
Maybe I can fit <i>you</i> in.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.436
Oh!

20:29.438 --> 20:30.437
Taco?

20:30.439 --> 20:30.971
Taco!

20:30.973 --> 20:34.441
Guys, we may want to get
downstairs, 'cause the computer

20:34.443 --> 20:36.609
starts drafting at 6:00
with or without us.

20:36.611 --> 20:37.210
What?!

20:37.212 --> 20:39.512
If we're not there, the
computer goes on auto-draft!

20:39.514 --> 20:40.513
Shit! Come on!

20:40.515 --> 20:41.514
The fire escape!

20:41.516 --> 20:42.982
Go to the fire escape!

20:42.984 --> 20:44.718
Time to start.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.620
Okay, here we go, boys.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.623
Okay, I'm moving
in, I'm moving in.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.624
You want a carrot?

20:49.626 --> 20:50.224
Yeah.

20:50.226 --> 20:52.227
Aren't craft services the best?

20:52.229 --> 20:53.695
(indistinct, excited chatter)

20:53.697 --> 20:54.696
No auto-draft!

20:54.698 --> 20:55.931
Now yell: "I have no dick."

20:55.933 --> 20:56.932
I have no dick.

20:56.934 --> 20:59.235
I don't feel a damn thing, Dr.
Dickless.

20:59.237 --> 21:00.370
Oh, yeah!

21:00.372 --> 21:01.537
You're nailing this.

21:01.539 --> 21:03.739
You are nailing this!

21:03.741 --> 21:04.874
It's locked, too.

21:04.876 --> 21:05.875
Give it to her, No-Dick.

21:05.877 --> 21:07.309
You guys, we're locked out.

21:07.311 --> 21:08.711
Look, the draft is starting!

21:08.713 --> 21:09.712
Let us in, you guys!

21:09.714 --> 21:10.713
This is not happening!

21:10.715 --> 21:12.714
We're locked out
of our own draft?

21:12.716 --> 21:13.815
It's so fast!

21:13.817 --> 21:15.950
It's like playing chess with
one of those guys in the park.

21:15.952 --> 21:16.951
It's so quick.

21:16.953 --> 21:17.952
Let us in!

21:17.954 --> 21:19.320
Hey! We're rolling.

21:19.322 --> 21:20.321
Shut your fat face-hole!

21:20.323 --> 21:21.322
Hey! Open the door!

21:21.324 --> 21:22.323
I can't.

21:22.325 --> 21:23.323
Raffi, what the hell?

21:23.325 --> 21:23.924
Come on!

21:23.926 --> 21:24.925
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

21:24.927 --> 21:26.928
You guys are getting me in
trouble with Dirty Randy!

21:26.930 --> 21:27.929
He's really upset right now.

21:27.931 --> 21:29.197
We're shooting a porno!

21:29.199 --> 21:30.966
Yeah! (gasping, panting)

21:30.968 --> 21:32.434
My team sucks!

21:32.436 --> 21:33.436
Let us in!

21:33.438 --> 21:34.437
This is great!

21:34.439 --> 21:37.908
When did this become
an expert league?

21:37.910 --> 21:39.944
That's good, that's
good, that's good.

21:39.946 --> 21:42.380
Is Plaxico Burress
still in jail?

21:42.382 --> 21:43.381
Anyone know?

21:43.383 --> 21:45.383
Donald Driver? Too early!

21:45.385 --> 21:46.885
I get a kicker! Perfect!

21:46.887 --> 21:47.886
You have two kickers?

21:47.888 --> 21:48.887
I don't even have one!

21:48.889 --> 21:49.888
I <i>knew</i> it was kicker year.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.456
Raffi, how am I
doing on my shots?

21:51.458 --> 21:54.459
You need a reverse master, then you
need a close-up of his asshole.

21:54.461 --> 21:56.595
You know, I've been watching
football my whole life-- I dot

21:56.597 --> 21:57.863
even know who this person is.

21:57.865 --> 22:01.266
No! I wanted Mike Williams, Tampa Bay!
Tampa Bay!

22:01.268 --> 22:03.569
Great. And I did need another defense.
Thank you!

22:03.571 --> 22:04.570
The Browns' defense?

22:04.572 --> 22:05.571
I wanted that!

22:05.573 --> 22:07.206
Tell me what you
think about my hair.

22:07.208 --> 22:08.208
You have hair! It rocks!

22:08.210 --> 22:09.376
(grunting): Yeah!

22:09.378 --> 22:11.945
Oh! Oh!

22:11.947 --> 22:12.947
(others groaning)

22:12.949 --> 22:13.948
(yells)

22:13.950 --> 22:14.949
This is the orgy at Andre's!

22:14.951 --> 22:16.451
Get in there, girl!

22:16.453 --> 22:17.619
Let's do this!

22:17.621 --> 22:18.954
Ooh... lordy!

22:18.956 --> 22:24.159
Dr. Andre No-Dick is scrubbed in and
ready to perform his examination.

22:24.161 --> 22:26.461
Wait, wait, wait, Ruxin--
is that your ring?

22:26.463 --> 22:32.766
No... oh... No, don't...
(others shouting)

22:32.768 --> 22:33.968
Whoa!

22:33.970 --> 22:36.804
He's doing a lot more
than kissing that ring.

22:36.806 --> 22:38.806
That's what I call Shiva-lingus.

22:38.808 --> 22:40.441
Bang, bang, what's the hang?

22:40.443 --> 22:43.643
Oh, Shiva ring, forever unclean!

22:43.645 --> 22:45.646
Ew! What'd you eat, girl?

22:45.648 --> 22:47.647
This porn is
disgusting, you guys!

22:47.649 --> 22:48.915
Is this what you like?

22:48.917 --> 22:49.917
OTHERS: No!

22:49.919 --> 22:51.919
No.

22:52.039 --> 23:02.225
