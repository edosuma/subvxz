WEBVTT

00:15.416 --> 00:20.083
Well, Kevin. It looks like you were right
about Charles Lovely being evil.

00:20.166 --> 00:23.666
What? Mr. Lovely probably
just wanted to give us all a skyline view

00:23.750 --> 00:25.416
to raise property values.

00:29.041 --> 00:32.916
Ignore your mother. She goes
into denial any time she fucks up.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.666
Remember when she ran over your puppy?

00:36.250 --> 00:37.375
He was a rapist.

00:37.458 --> 00:41.500
Randall! Tell us you got a plan
to save our skinny white asses!

00:41.583 --> 00:44.291
Actually, I think Kevin
should take the lead on this one.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.000
-Really?
-Yes.

00:46.083 --> 00:49.125
I'm sorry I've been hard on you
all these years, son.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.791
I was too focused on turning you
into the man I wanted you to be

00:52.875 --> 00:57.666
to appreciate the whiny asshole
you are. I'm proud of you.

00:57.750 --> 00:58.833
Thanks, Dad.

01:00.208 --> 01:04.000
We're gonna trust him?!
But I'm too young to die!

01:04.083 --> 01:06.500
I didn't even finish my fuck-it list.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.666
Give me that.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.541
A one-armed ventriloquist.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.500
A fully plucked albatross.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.000
Hordak from the <i>She-Ra</i> cartoon.

01:15.083 --> 01:16.666
Huh. So far, same as mine.

01:17.958 --> 01:20.666
Hey. Why are all our names on the list?

01:20.750 --> 01:22.541
Why is mine crossed out?

01:23.833 --> 01:26.166
You, uh, promise
you're a woman over there?

01:26.250 --> 01:28.625
I swear on my testicles.

01:28.708 --> 01:30.416
Good enough for me.

01:32.333 --> 01:36.125
Hopson's right. With Kevin in charge,
we're probably all gonna die today.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.750
Well, I'm just bummed about all the things
that Junior will never get to experience.

01:40.833 --> 01:44.041
Well, let's give him
all the best experiences of life

01:44.125 --> 01:45.166
all in one day!

01:45.250 --> 01:48.083
Yeah! That's a great idea!
What's the first thing we should show him?

01:48.166 --> 01:49.708
I got an idea.

01:49.791 --> 01:50.875
No, Hopson!

01:50.958 --> 01:52.416
Damn stick in the muds.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.333
We have to get everyone off the city.

01:54.416 --> 01:56.375
But I've gotta bust
the resistance out first.

01:56.458 --> 01:59.166
Norf says they're being held
in the Lovely Fulfillment Center.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.333
Norf looks like the man for the job

02:01.416 --> 02:03.708
if that job is hosting
an unpopular podcast

02:03.791 --> 02:05.500
about <i>Attack on Titan</i> manga.

02:05.583 --> 02:09.000
I better tag along
in case you need some backup, big bro.

02:09.083 --> 02:13.541
Great. Everyone else, try to figure out
a way to make the city heavier

02:13.625 --> 02:15.375
to push it back down to Earth.

02:15.458 --> 02:18.000
Ugh, too bad we only have one Dusty.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.708
Man, I can't believe I just said that.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.791
Your wish is my command, Chief.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.500
Ain't nothing heavier
than a Marlow family reunion.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.000
I'm working on a Evite.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.625
You really think
your family will come to a reunion

02:28.708 --> 02:31.541
in a city that's hovering at 38,000 feet?

02:31.625 --> 02:32.583
I think they will.

02:32.666 --> 02:36.291
"All-you-care-to-eat
homemade mac and cheese."

02:36.375 --> 02:37.208
Send!

02:42.333 --> 02:47.250
Whoo! Get ready to meet my cousins
from around the world!

03:08.083 --> 03:12.333
W-Wait a minute.
All of your cousins are also named Dusty?

03:12.416 --> 03:14.791
No. I just never bothered
to learn their names.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.208
My name is Randy.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.083
Shut up, Cockeyed Dusty!

03:26.750 --> 03:29.791
Now, Robby, don't forget
you got that dentist appointment today.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.791
Yeah, I was thinking
about cancelling that shit.

03:31.875 --> 03:32.708
Why?

03:32.791 --> 03:36.083
Because the damn city is floating
in the sky, and we all about to die.

03:36.166 --> 03:39.083
You always got some excuse
for not going to the dentist, Robby.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.833
Last time, you said
the town was a giant pizza.

03:41.916 --> 03:44.833
It was! Our chair's a big-ass pepperoni!

03:45.875 --> 03:48.041
I know our papasan's from Papa John's,

03:48.125 --> 03:50.666
but you are not missing
that appointment, mister.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.833
Your mouth is a mess.
I mean, half your teeth are white LEGOs.

03:55.666 --> 03:57.666
You're just jealous 'cause I can do this.

03:59.625 --> 04:01.250
You can spit out a helicopter?

04:01.333 --> 04:03.083
I didn't just spit out a helicopter!

04:03.166 --> 04:06.041
I spit out
the entire Strawberry Action Squad.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.500
<i>Strawberry Action Squad Playset!</i>

04:12.583 --> 04:13.875
<i>Do not use as teeth.</i>

04:16.208 --> 04:18.416
Parachute pants, prenatal vitamins,

04:18.500 --> 04:21.416
prisoners, pregnancy porn.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.041
Clappers, at least
let me fold you up, baby.

04:25.125 --> 04:28.416
No. Leave me crumpled-up
in the corner where I belong.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.083
This is what I deserve
for getting Norf killed.

04:31.166 --> 04:34.750
Emotional pain
hurts worse than anything.

04:34.833 --> 04:38.208
Except stuffing croutons
up your dick hole.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.166
Why are you here?

04:40.250 --> 04:42.750
Did Lovely find out that you're a rat?!

04:42.833 --> 04:43.958
No, I live here.

04:44.041 --> 04:47.166
Why would you work for that evil bastard?

04:47.250 --> 04:50.791
I needed a job, and it was less toxic
than working for Ellen.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.708
Ah!

04:52.791 --> 04:55.916
Hey, friendlies. Lay off my prison wife.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.958
Who, me?

04:57.041 --> 05:00.416
Yeah, you got
the softest hands in here, baby.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.708
Get over here and brush my hair.

05:02.791 --> 05:03.625
Yes, dear.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.708
Jerry, how's the escape plan going?

05:09.208 --> 05:12.875
Great. Now, put yourself back together
and go find the key.

05:12.958 --> 05:15.166
I never said I could do that.

05:17.250 --> 05:21.458
I know it's a little tight in here,
but we gonna have a great family reunion.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.750
There's plenty of food for all of us.

05:23.833 --> 05:27.541
As long as we all equally
share this cup of Kraft Easy Mac.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.291
Ohhh!

05:30.375 --> 05:32.625
Who ate my damn finger?!

05:32.708 --> 05:34.041
My name is Randy.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.708
Stop it, Old-Timey Saloon-Fight Dusty!

05:37.791 --> 05:39.708
I'm about sick of my GD family!

05:39.791 --> 05:42.666
Yeah! The Dusty family reunion is working!

05:42.750 --> 05:44.916
The city has dropped 10,000 feet.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.333
But if we're gonna get back
to Earth, we need more Dustys.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.791
Well, there are more Dustys,

05:49.875 --> 05:52.041
but we never invite them
to the family reunions,

05:52.125 --> 05:53.750
'cause they a bit much.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.166
But I suppose I could summon…

05:56.250 --> 05:57.875
the Forbidden Dustys.

05:58.583 --> 06:01.208
What the hell are you doing here?

06:01.291 --> 06:03.375
You don't belong here, Live Action Dusty.

06:03.458 --> 06:05.416
Kiss my ass, ya fartknocker.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.833
Junior, Daddy's got some bad news.

06:10.916 --> 06:13.958
Did you steal my piggy bank again
to buy cocaine?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.708
No. I mean, yeah.

06:15.791 --> 06:17.416
But the good news is that doesn't matter,

06:17.500 --> 06:19.583
because the bad news
is that we're all gonna die today.

06:19.666 --> 06:21.666
Fuck yeah!
I love the way I talk when I'm on blow.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.625
Don't worry. You're still gonna
experience life to the fullest.

06:25.708 --> 06:28.375
First, I'm gonna teach you
to play the piccolo.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.625
Even if we don't have time
for anything else…

06:30.708 --> 06:32.833
…what a way to go, huh?

06:32.916 --> 06:35.958
Really? That's what you think our son
should experience on his last day?

06:36.041 --> 06:38.458
-Oh, do you have any better ideas?

06:40.708 --> 06:44.166
Big Butter!

06:44.250 --> 06:45.416
This is Big Butter.

06:45.500 --> 06:48.041
Yeah, I-I-I got that.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.916
Bullet, our son
is not gonna sleep with a hooker.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.166
Fine. It's my last day too.

06:53.250 --> 06:56.291
If you don't mind,
I am going to go churn that butter.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.708
Big Butter!

06:57.791 --> 07:00.625
Save that pillow talk, baby.
Treat me like a piece of dry toast.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.916
Congrats on your new career
as a Lovely Corp warehouse worker.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.041
Where you'll get to work
in a 102-degree warehouse,

07:10.125 --> 07:13.875
walk 80 miles a day,
and take bimonthly bathroom breaks.

07:13.958 --> 07:16.708
Don't worry.
You'll be issued a Lovely Corp Diaper.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.750
It even comes with an asshole spike,

07:18.833 --> 07:21.791
in case you get
the nasty temptation to sit down.

07:21.875 --> 07:25.458
This is a pretty sweet job.
I used to work for Amazon.

07:25.541 --> 07:29.541
Please see the monitor for information
on the Warehouse Worker Union.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.000
Hey. I think we should start a union.

07:39.416 --> 07:40.250
There they are!

07:42.250 --> 07:46.125
Hey, Kevin! Get us out!
You'll need a key or some--

07:47.041 --> 07:51.791
Uh… I think this is a dog's cage.
There's not even a lock.

07:51.875 --> 07:54.291
I told you someone else
should've tried to open it!

07:55.583 --> 07:57.500
Norf! You're alive!

07:59.958 --> 08:02.041
Fuck you, Norf. I wasn't sad.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.875
Well, I hear
it's your first time at the dentist.

08:05.958 --> 08:08.291
Don't be nervous.
Hop on the chair and get ready.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.416
First, we'll--

08:09.500 --> 08:10.666
What are you doing?

08:10.750 --> 08:11.958
Just saving you the trouble.

08:12.041 --> 08:15.125
It's gonna be real hard
to get my pants off once you gas me.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.916
Sir, I-I-I don't do that.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.083
Man, if you ain't gonna
feed my dick croutons,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.625
what kinda dentist are you?

08:24.083 --> 08:27.125
Son, bird-watching
is relaxing and educational.

08:27.208 --> 08:29.000
Do you see that band-tailed pigeon?

08:29.708 --> 08:31.333
Oh, it's got something on his leg.

08:31.416 --> 08:33.000
Is that a Polaroid?

08:33.083 --> 08:33.916
Oh!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.125
Look away, Junior.

08:36.708 --> 08:37.833
Junior?

08:37.916 --> 08:39.333
Okay, kid. Take a look here.

08:39.416 --> 08:41.958
This is grain alcohol.
This is weed. This is Molly.

08:42.041 --> 08:43.416
Just say no to these pussy drugs.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.583
You're skipping these
and going straight to heroin.

08:45.666 --> 08:47.375
Remember that first time
you tried ice cream?

08:47.458 --> 08:49.333
You were like,
"This is the greatest thing ever!"

08:49.416 --> 08:51.416
Well, you're about
to feel real stupid right now.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.125
Bullet! What the hell are you doing?!

08:54.208 --> 08:56.541
I don't know.
Trying to give the kid a great last day?

08:56.625 --> 08:58.000
Psh. You should be happy.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.291
Heroin's the only thing that could
make him enjoy fucking bird-watching.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.875
-How dare you say that!
-I guess we're gonna yell over each other!

09:03.958 --> 09:06.750
Oh, I'll kill a motherfucker
for saying that about bird-watching!

09:06.833 --> 09:07.750
Stop it!

09:07.833 --> 09:10.416
The only thing I wanna do on my last day

09:10.500 --> 09:14.666
is spend it with my dads,
doing my favorite thing.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.083
You're right, Junior. This is nice.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.166
Yes. It is.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.708
Big Butter!

09:22.791 --> 09:25.208
Yeah. Uh, Big Butter and I got married.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.791
I decided it's my last day
on Earth, so…

09:28.875 --> 09:31.708
…I did some of your heroin,
and here we are.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.666
Here come them Forbidden Dustys!

10:04.583 --> 10:07.583
I know I wasn't supposed to slap
both of them, but I can't help it.

10:07.666 --> 10:10.708
My pimp hand is too goddamn strong!

10:12.583 --> 10:13.916
Almost there.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
One more small-to-medium-sized Dusty
should do it.

10:17.083 --> 10:21.458
Well, there's only one more Dusty,
and he's a little on the big side.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.291
Meet Big Chungus Dusty.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.708
Goddamn! Why is he so big?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.458
That's how big Dustys grow
in the wild, silly.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.833
What the fuck?!

10:44.458 --> 10:45.916
All right, Genius Dusty.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.208
Can you figure out a way
to get us back to Earth?

10:48.291 --> 10:50.291
According to mine calculations,

10:50.375 --> 10:54.375
if we all don't eat
for the next 37 minutes--

10:54.458 --> 10:55.708
I got a better idea.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.250
Thank you, <i>300</i> Dusty.

11:00.333 --> 11:04.750
Actually, I'm Gerard Butler.
Things have gone south, mate.

11:09.708 --> 11:10.708
Vroom-vroom!

11:16.833 --> 11:18.625
Mmm. What do we have here?

11:18.708 --> 11:22.500
In another life, I'd be swinging
on that King Kong's ding-dong.

11:25.125 --> 11:27.833
Charles! Those idiots
have grounded the city.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.333
We have to act now,
or the target could escape.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.333
There is no escape.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.583
Sorry about those holes in your tongue.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.041
I've switched to my new Lovely Drill.
Should be much safer.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.875
This is why
I don't like the goddamn dentist.

11:52.666 --> 11:57.000
<i>You simpletons paid</i>
<i>to bring my products into your homes.</i>

11:57.083 --> 12:00.208
<i>They were so affordable, so convenient.</i>

12:00.291 --> 12:03.583
<i>Like lambs to the slaughter.</i>

12:03.666 --> 12:06.291
Meh. Still as stupid than a giant pizza.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.625
See? Huh?
What'd I tell you about these things?

12:13.708 --> 12:16.750
Still think he's not evil, Karen?

12:16.833 --> 12:19.500
What? Products attack people all the time.

12:19.583 --> 12:23.291
It's true. An eggbeater went
up my ass three times this week.

12:23.791 --> 12:25.833
He works the breakfast shift at Denny's.

12:25.916 --> 12:27.375
<i>But you are in luck.</i>

12:27.458 --> 12:29.791
<i>I only want Kevin Crawford.</i>

12:29.875 --> 12:32.541
<i>No one else has to die.</i>

12:32.625 --> 12:36.000
Hey, a pretty sweet deal,
I'd say. But why Kevin?

12:36.083 --> 12:39.500
Obviously,
I'm a romantic rival for his wife.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.875
He sees me as a sexual threat.

12:41.958 --> 12:44.791
Well, take me!
Leave everyone else out of it!

12:44.875 --> 12:48.833
<i>Not you, AFKAK. I said Kevin Crawford.</i>

12:50.583 --> 12:55.291
Hey! I just realized
there's something creepy about this doll.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.458
Stop! That's the son I do love!

13:01.541 --> 13:05.041
Wait. I love both sons now. Weird.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.291
<i>He is mine now.</i>

13:06.375 --> 13:09.000
<i>Also, small change of plans.</i>

13:09.083 --> 13:11.000
<i>You do have to die.</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:14.833
I was born for this day.

13:14.916 --> 13:17.000
This is for all dogs everywhere.

13:21.083 --> 13:25.250
Whoo. I'm glad
I ain't got none of them products.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.708
Don't you have a Lovely Corp Pacemaker?

13:32.208 --> 13:33.708
Thanks for saving me, Fitz.

13:33.791 --> 13:37.500
Saving hell. It's a six-slice toaster!
I'm taking this shit home!

13:39.333 --> 13:43.208
I'll fight you, but only because
I'm looking forward to the make-up snacks.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.291
Great. Now I look bald!

13:50.375 --> 13:51.500
Fight, Norf! Fight!

13:51.583 --> 13:53.500
But you said I'm not on the team.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.083
Since when do you listen to laundry?

13:55.166 --> 13:56.833
But I'm scared.

13:56.916 --> 13:59.541
Oh, I know you are.
'Cause my neck's covered in your piss!

14:01.875 --> 14:06.583
That's right, Jerry! Now's our chance
to kill all the Isotoner gloves!

14:06.666 --> 14:08.708
They will mock us no more!

14:12.125 --> 14:14.583
Good job taking out
those products, Camaro Bob.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.958
Don't thank me. I'm just drunk.

14:17.041 --> 14:20.458
Thank God
there weren't schoolkids this time, baby.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.333
It's cooking my head!

14:25.416 --> 14:26.416
Huh?!

14:27.416 --> 14:31.125
Whoa. All these products
are powered by Vlad.

14:31.208 --> 14:35.625
Hey, Vlad. I need you to stop
these smart products, or we're all dead.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.750
<i>Okay, but you have to let Vlad</i>
<i>borrow your body, and you go see Bleemo.</i>

14:39.833 --> 14:41.208
To get the horse teeth?

14:41.291 --> 14:43.875
<i>No. Bleemo turn you into a centaur.</i>

14:43.958 --> 14:49.000
Wow! Metal shoes
and a horse cock? Yes, please!

14:49.083 --> 14:54.083
<i>Deal. Setting all Lovely products'</i>
<i>warranty expiration to one minute ago.</i>

14:58.541 --> 14:59.750
Fucking ow!

15:02.125 --> 15:05.375
Time to finish you off, vacuum.

15:07.708 --> 15:10.125
You're a girl vacuum?

15:18.791 --> 15:20.500
Hey, fuck it. We're all gonna die.

15:24.416 --> 15:26.125
Now, Delbert,
I tried to go to the dentist,

15:26.208 --> 15:27.708
but he drilled holes in my tongue,

15:27.791 --> 15:30.500
and then the drill came to life
and killed the goddamn dentist.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.583
Sounds like more excuses to me, Robby.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.875
So you ain't never
gonna get your teeth fixed?

15:34.958 --> 15:37.291
Oh, I did. I went to Bleemo.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.708
He gave you horse teeth?

15:39.791 --> 15:40.708
That ain't all.

15:51.208 --> 15:54.625
It's no use.
Cal Fullerton broke off the handles.

15:54.708 --> 15:56.500
He does have strong hands.

15:56.583 --> 16:01.791
He made my tallywacker
look like a used-up tube of, uh…

16:01.875 --> 16:04.791
What's that dental pudding you Yanks use?

16:04.875 --> 16:06.166
Mouth custard?

16:06.250 --> 16:08.833
Ah, that's it. Mouth custard.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.625
Look! Our clones are still inside!

16:11.708 --> 16:15.916
There's a neural chair that could transfer
our consciousness into those clones.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.291
But the goddamn chair's inside too!

16:18.375 --> 16:22.375
Actually, I ordered eight total
to see which color went with the room.

16:22.458 --> 16:25.500
Go take them down, Alpha Kevin.

16:25.583 --> 16:26.916
Will do.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.125
To the chairs!

16:28.208 --> 16:29.541
Yeah!

16:32.250 --> 16:34.458
Yeah,
we're going to <i>Brickleberry</i>!

16:45.041 --> 16:46.083
Yeah! We're in.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.375
Wait. What the hell?

16:47.458 --> 16:49.583
Aw, our bodies got all mixed up.

16:50.291 --> 16:53.708
Well, oh boy.
Look what you're packing, Fitz.

16:53.791 --> 16:56.291
Stop looking at my dick, Hopson.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.625
I can jump!

16:57.708 --> 17:00.666
For the first time
in my life, I can jump!

17:00.750 --> 17:02.875
I'm a jumper, Mama!

17:02.958 --> 17:06.000
The doctors said
it was physically impossible!

17:06.083 --> 17:08.041
My heart hurts,
my pulse is racing,

17:08.125 --> 17:11.000
and my saliva, ugh, it tastes
like the floor of a Cinnabon.

17:11.083 --> 17:14.125
Ugh.
My skin feels like wet tissue paper.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.625
Hey! Whoever's in my body,
get your hands off my tits!

17:17.708 --> 17:21.416
It's definitely
not Kevin, Mom.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.833
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

17:26.041 --> 17:29.125
We need to jump back
into the tanks and get unscrambled

17:29.208 --> 17:31.583
before Hopson makes me blow myself.

17:31.666 --> 17:34.125
Almost there.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.041
Just a little closer.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.583
Everybody normal?

17:41.666 --> 17:43.250
I'm pretty sure Kevin's not.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.791
<i>You're going to need my help</i>
<i>to get to the roof.</i>

17:51.875 --> 17:54.375
<i>Look for a device</i>
<i>in the center of the lobby.</i>

17:54.458 --> 17:58.208
<i>It's a metal box</i>
<i>that can transport you upwards.</i>

17:58.291 --> 17:59.750
An elevator?

17:59.833 --> 18:02.583
<i>Uh, you Americans and your silly words.</i>

18:02.666 --> 18:07.208
<i>In England, we call it up-down</i>
<i>dinga-ding ding-dong up-down room.</i>

18:07.291 --> 18:11.208
<i>Now, I left exact copies</i>
<i>of your clothes in that closet</i>

18:11.291 --> 18:14.208
<i>to make things easier for the animators.</i>

18:18.083 --> 18:21.750
<i>Now, make sure you only hit "roof access."</i>

18:21.833 --> 18:25.500
<i>Lovely Corp has some pretty weird stuff</i>
<i>on the lower floors.</i>

18:25.583 --> 18:27.000
Christmas tree!

18:27.083 --> 18:28.916
Dusty, no-- Goddamn it!

18:29.000 --> 18:31.916
What do you think's gonna be
on the other side that's so scary?

18:37.625 --> 18:39.958
Close door! Close door! Hit "close door"!

18:40.041 --> 18:42.125
I'm hitting it! This button's a lie!

18:44.208 --> 18:47.125
And only 95 more floors to go.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.750
Ooh. Well, this is weird.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.791
-Why is the damn door still open?!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.666
Oh, uh… Sorry.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.333
-What? I like fantasy.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.250
What the…

19:10.333 --> 19:13.958
I'm you, 20 minutes from now.
It does not go well.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.666
Well, tell us what happens.

19:15.750 --> 19:17.500
You hate spoilers, Dusty.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.500
Oh, you don't know me, bitch.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.166
Give me my brother back, you asshole!

19:28.250 --> 19:31.416
Why do you cling to this dying world?

19:31.500 --> 19:33.041
You are all doomed.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.750
I have seen the future, and it is--

19:35.833 --> 19:37.416
Ah, just get to the point!

19:37.500 --> 19:39.541
Yeah. You're giving me a hard-off.

19:39.625 --> 19:40.458
Yuck.

19:40.541 --> 19:45.583
Ever since I first set eyes on this child
and learned of his immortality,

19:45.666 --> 19:48.666
I knew that he was what I was seeking.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.416
Soon, when the planets align,

19:51.500 --> 19:54.875
I shall consume
the Crawford child's essence

19:54.958 --> 19:56.666
to gain immortality.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.125
Like hell you are!

20:02.416 --> 20:05.625
-It is so important to marry well.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.541
Stay back!

20:09.625 --> 20:12.416
You made me bite my tongue, you bitch!

20:12.500 --> 20:14.708
Gina, you can't let him do this.

20:14.791 --> 20:18.250
Stay out of it, Kevin!
You're gonna ruin everything!

20:23.708 --> 20:26.791
The Eternal Reckoning shall begin!

20:39.333 --> 20:42.208
See? It's shit like this
why I don't like capitalism.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.041
Yes. Yes.

20:52.291 --> 20:54.833
Freeze, you creepy fuck,
or I'm putting one between your eyes!

20:54.916 --> 20:56.916
Gina! You're undercover?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.166
Yeah, and you almost
blew it for me a dozen times.

21:00.250 --> 21:03.875
I don't get it. Did you join the FBI
or something after you ran off?

21:03.958 --> 21:06.500
FBI? That's pussy shit.

21:06.583 --> 21:09.250
I joined the Strawberry Action Squad.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
No! Not my higher hair!

21:47.083 --> 21:50.125
It's time to feel the wrath of My Pillow.

21:51.666 --> 21:54.166
Holy shit! This pillow is made of crack!

21:59.708 --> 22:01.250
Eat blarney stone, you fecking prick.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.958
You wanna know
why they call me Johnny Pecs?

22:08.041 --> 22:09.291
Because of your pecs?

22:09.375 --> 22:10.208
Uh-huh.

22:13.208 --> 22:16.000
Ha ha. I wanna fight
the old man in the bathrobe.

22:16.083 --> 22:18.541
Actually, I'm a karate wizard.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.833
Wow. Alpha Kevin.

22:26.916 --> 22:29.208
Yeah. That's what they call me now.

22:29.291 --> 22:30.708
No, we don't!

22:30.791 --> 22:33.625
Kevin, I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you about my mission,

22:33.708 --> 22:35.666
but I never stopped loving you.

22:37.000 --> 22:37.958
Mmm.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.041
-You feel better than Mom's tits.
-What?

22:41.125 --> 22:45.250
We've been surveilling this creepy
sumbitch Charles Lovely for years.

22:45.333 --> 22:48.625
Thanks to our new member,
we got him red-damn-handed.

22:48.708 --> 22:51.291
But how did Gina end up
in the Strawberry Action Squad?

22:51.375 --> 22:52.916
After I lost control at our wedding,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.333
I just wanted to get
as far away as possible.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.250
Siberia.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.291
<i>For fun,</i>
<i>sometimes I like to enter myself</i>

23:01.375 --> 23:03.666
<i>in Siberian bare-knuckle death matches.</i>

23:03.750 --> 23:07.791
<i>Lo and behold, my opponent</i>
<i>was your little blonde firecracker</i>

23:07.875 --> 23:08.875
<i>with the crazy eyes.</i>

23:08.958 --> 23:11.875
<i>I never fought anyone</i>
<i>with such brute strength</i>,

23:11.958 --> 23:15.458
<i>and she'd never fought anyone trained</i>
<i>in the art of Brazilian slap-fighting.</i>

23:15.541 --> 23:17.000
<i>The fight ended in a draw.</i>

23:17.083 --> 23:19.291
-Diddy!
-Not now, boy.

23:19.375 --> 23:22.791
I taught Gina how to control
and channel her aggression through--

23:22.875 --> 23:24.166
Diddy, look!

23:29.083 --> 23:31.000
No! Baby Kevin!

23:31.083 --> 23:34.041
No!

23:34.125 --> 23:38.666
Why didn't you say something, fat boy?
You know how I am when I get to talking.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.375
Randall! What are we gonna do?!

23:59.041 --> 24:00.416
Ugh. Kill me.

24:03.041 --> 24:06.458
Wait a minute. Why would
a series finale have a cliffhanger?

24:06.541 --> 24:09.250
'Cause we didn't know
this was a series finale when we made it.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.166
Oh yeah.

24:10.250 --> 24:12.666
I guess we can wrap this up
on <i>Farzar</i> then?

24:12.750 --> 24:13.875
Yeah, I guess so.

24:14.375 --> 24:16.375
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.333
I guess we're dead now. Bye.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.416
Damn, that's dark, Robby.
