WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:08.475 --> 00:09.743
Oi, oi!

00:09.809 --> 00:11.478
Oh, my God, it's Kyle!

00:11.544 --> 00:13.179
It's totally see-through.

00:13.246 --> 00:16.583
I cannot stop looking
at her arse in that cat suit.

00:16.649 --> 00:18.017
Maybe I do fancy Kyle.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.220
But this isn't the time
or the place.

00:20.286 --> 00:21.654
Come on.

00:23.990 --> 00:28.161
I've realised I want to be with
Charlotte. I have to give it a go.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.563
Where's your friends? I've got mine.

00:31.598 --> 00:34.067
How can I like someone
who is that nasty?

00:34.134 --> 00:35.902
Why the fuck did I just say that?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.303
That was a step too far.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.341
I'm so glad Marty's apologised.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.376
Don't be trying no monkey business.

00:43.443 --> 00:45.945
I might be pissed,
but I know what you're up to.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.248
It's not gonna work.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.088
Nipple piercing?
Is he coming on to me?

00:58.525 --> 01:01.261
That stupid arsehole
has ended our relationship.

01:01.327 --> 01:04.497
I'll argue with you.
Let's go.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.933
I have never seen
Marnie and Aaron like this.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.502
What have I done?
I thought it was bad enough.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.604
I've just made them ten times worse.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.609
Oh, my God,
he must love us after all.

01:16.676 --> 01:18.978
It looks like they're back together.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.246
(moaning)

01:22.048 --> 01:23.983
I have a degree in pulling women.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.286
Never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:26.352 --> 01:29.456
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.758
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.127
I'm radge and I wrap
lads around my finger.

01:34.194 --> 01:36.162
I'm preened to perfection.

01:36.229 --> 01:38.097
I'm totally crackers me, like.

01:38.164 --> 01:40.333
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.602
Me banter's pure naughty.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.737
I'm fake, flirty,
I've got double Fs.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.673
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:00.720 --> 02:01.788
Aaron!

02:03.490 --> 02:06.726
Morning.
Fuck! Your breath!

02:06.793 --> 02:09.496
So bad this morning!
Eurgh!

02:09.562 --> 02:11.397
Last night
I slept in the girls room

02:11.464 --> 02:14.367
cos I felt like shit
and I needed a break from Aaron.

02:14.434 --> 02:17.537
Why are you in here?
I think my fanny wanted a break.

02:17.604 --> 02:21.241
I'm happy for Marnie and Aaron that
they're finally making a go of it.

02:21.307 --> 02:24.644
If only the rest of the
relationships weren't so fucked up.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.980
I had to fucking put Kyle
to bed last night.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.815
I physically had to put him to bed.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.783
I had so much fun
with Kyle last night

02:30.850 --> 02:32.986
and I feel as though
we're getting closer

02:33.052 --> 02:36.389
and with two days left, I'm
just so glad he's here to share it.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.258
Kyle asked, like,

02:38.324 --> 02:41.261
"Out of the lads, you're the
closest I am to in this house

02:41.327 --> 02:44.731
so I want to go on a day out
with you." But then he's like,

02:44.797 --> 02:46.499
"I wanna get my nipple pierced."

02:46.566 --> 02:49.168
Last night Kyle asked us
to go on a date with him

02:49.235 --> 02:53.339
and now I'm gonna get my tit pierced
and I'm scared of fucking needles.

02:53.406 --> 02:54.407
Great.

02:54.474 --> 02:56.142
Shall we get some breakfast?

02:56.209 --> 02:57.810
Yeah.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.586
Mate, oh, God,
she was mortal last night.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.923
I was literally wrestling her
out of the door.

03:09.989 --> 03:12.058
I wish I could be friends with Chloe,

03:12.125 --> 03:16.262
but she wants more than that and she
just doesn't know where the line is.

03:16.329 --> 03:19.065
(shouting)

03:19.132 --> 03:22.001
You got owned, bitch!
Fuck off!

03:27.273 --> 03:30.877
I think we should do it
before I chicken out.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.645
While the others are tanning,

03:32.712 --> 03:35.748
me and Nathan are gonna
get our nipples pierced.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.920
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm freaking out about this.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.989
I'll let you go first

03:43.056 --> 03:47.560
and if I bottle it, don't be mad at,
just be happy we're together.

03:53.232 --> 03:55.501
Hi, again. We're back.

03:55.568 --> 03:59.238
We've got to the piercing shop
and I feel physically sick.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.407
Hiya.
Nerves.

04:01.474 --> 04:05.979
I've decided to go first to show him
there's nothing to worry about,

04:06.045 --> 04:08.414
but the truth is,
I'm really shitting it.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.984
Right. Right. Let's do this shit.
Come on.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.586
I can't believe
I'm about to watch this.

04:13.653 --> 04:15.254
My palms are fucking sweaty.

04:15.321 --> 04:18.358
(nervous laughter)

04:18.423 --> 04:21.060
Kyle is making some weird noises.

04:21.127 --> 04:24.464
He sounds like a whimpering dog.
Shut up, you little pussy.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.265
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!

04:26.332 --> 04:30.069
(whimpering) Oh, fuck.

04:30.136 --> 04:31.404
Fucking hell!

04:31.471 --> 04:34.507
I am gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick.

04:34.574 --> 04:35.742
I'm gonna be sick.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.811
(pained whimpering)

04:38.878 --> 04:40.813
Ah! What the fuck?

04:40.880 --> 04:46.252
(screaming, retching)

04:46.319 --> 04:48.321
Oh, my God, I'm gonna pass out.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.656
(retching)

04:49.722 --> 04:52.325
How the fuck am I gonna do this?

04:53.326 --> 04:56.496
I'm sorry... I'm really sorry...
I can't... I'm not...

04:56.562 --> 05:00.667
Kyle's done and that
was fucking horrific.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.968
Now it's my turn.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.237
Come on. Get your legs up.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.782
So, they've gone to get
their nipples pierced.

05:15.848 --> 05:18.851
Together. On a little date.

05:18.918 --> 05:22.422
Wait, are you telling me
Nathan's getting his nipple pierced?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.825
He's the biggest coward I know.
He will not go through with it.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.863
Yeah, but this is
an easy one, isn't it?

05:34.834 --> 05:38.204
But I don't think he's clever enough
to think like that.

05:39.972 --> 05:42.375
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.443
Fuck.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.145
He's touching me.
Oh, my God, he's touching me.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.581
Even that hurts.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.283
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

05:50.349 --> 05:53.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
It's fine.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.921
Oh, my fucking God!

05:54.987 --> 05:59.058
(shouting)

05:59.125 --> 06:01.694
Fuck! Oh, my fucking God!

06:01.761 --> 06:04.263
You lying son of a bitch!
That fucking hurts!

06:04.330 --> 06:06.199
It kills. I'm not gonna lie.

06:06.265 --> 06:08.668
I've never,
ever witnessed childbirth,

06:08.735 --> 06:12.538
but I can't imagine it to be half as
bad as what Nathan's going through.

06:12.605 --> 06:16.375
(screaming, laughter)

06:16.442 --> 06:18.077
You're breaking my hand, mate.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.680
I never realised how strong
Nathan actually is.

06:20.747 --> 06:24.817
Mate, you're breaking my hand.
Are we done?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.085
It looks fucking mint.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.589
I'm not gonna lie, I feel a bit sexy
now that I've had that done.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.824
I think I've gone
from an eight to a nine.

06:31.891 --> 06:35.561
I feel like we've just taken
our friendship to the next level.

06:35.628 --> 06:38.397
Now that I'm over the pain,
I kind of like it.

06:38.464 --> 06:42.068
I feel like a thug,
and me and Kyle are thugs together.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.703
Today was a success.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.172
We'll go for coffee next time.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.242
Do you think you get another date
after this? Are you mad?

06:49.308 --> 06:50.476
Are you actually mad?

06:50.543 --> 06:53.813
This is has been one of the funniest
dates I've ever been on.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.816
It's time to get back and show
everyone my new piercing.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.285
Bye.
See you later.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.720
Bye!

07:00.787 --> 07:02.889
Is yours hurting when you walk?
Yeah.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.224
Slow down, I can't walk that fast.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.300
I've been finding it hard
to be around Kyle

07:14.367 --> 07:15.902
and not knowing where I stand

07:15.968 --> 07:19.038
I'm gonna speak to Gary,
cos he's known us since day one.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.607
Like, I've watched him and

07:21.674 --> 07:23.976
if he was gonna pull
he'd have done it by now.

07:24.043 --> 07:27.747
For me, yous are both
just playing this big act.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.883
And I honestly think
you need to just drop it.

07:30.950 --> 07:35.588
And be honest with each other
before it's too late.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.125
I've known Holly for five years
and I can tell she's head over heels

07:39.192 --> 07:40.226
in love with Kyle.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.329
But I don't want her to leave it
like I have with Charlotte.

07:43.396 --> 07:47.967
Obviously I do still like him, like,
my feelings haven't changed.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.170
I'm terrified, I don't want
to argue and fight and kick off.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.940
If he doesn't pull
and he hangs around with you,

07:54.006 --> 07:56.642
how are you gonna argue?
I don't understand.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.045
Gary's right. I do need
to stop playing games

07:59.111 --> 08:01.547
and just be honest about
how I feel about Kyle.

08:01.614 --> 08:04.116
I do love him
and I need to talk to him.

08:04.183 --> 08:06.652
I think today, tonight,
before it's too late,

08:06.719 --> 08:09.255
you need to be like,
"I have feelings for you

08:09.322 --> 08:11.724
and I'd rather enjoy
my last nights with you."

08:11.791 --> 08:14.760
I'll speak with him today,
before we have a drink, maybe.

08:15.628 --> 08:16.796
Good.

08:21.801 --> 08:26.305
We've got back to the villa, I cannot
wait to show everyone my new tit.

08:26.372 --> 08:28.307
Hey, the happy couple!

08:28.374 --> 08:30.743
Here they are, the boyfriends!

08:30.810 --> 08:32.078
Come on then, show us!

08:32.144 --> 08:35.748
Here, that fucking hurts that, like.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.984
It's so small.
Tiny.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.251
(screaming)

08:39.318 --> 08:42.655
Let me guess, it was the worst pain
you've ever been through.

08:42.722 --> 08:48.094
It was the worst pain
I have ever been through.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.362
He went boss-eyed.

08:49.428 --> 08:54.300
That's a canny piercing you've got
there, it shows off them man boobs.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.102
(phone rings)

08:56.168 --> 08:58.604
I'll get it.
Really?

08:58.671 --> 09:00.373
Best not be work. I can't run.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.608
The phone rings
and Nathan gets it,

09:02.675 --> 09:05.278
that is definitely Anna
sending us all to work.

09:05.344 --> 09:06.879
What a bitch!

09:11.651 --> 09:12.952
Right.

09:17.356 --> 09:19.292
Right. OK.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.229
Yeah.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.536
Kyle's gotta leave.
This is fucked up.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.638
Bye.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.041
Fuck.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.977
Why the fuck did I answer the phone?

09:38.044 --> 09:40.713
Now I've gotta break the news
to everybody else.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.786
I don't understand, I thought
Holly and Kyle were friends.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.587
I can't let this happen again.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.022
I nearly lost him.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.159
I have to ask Kyle if it's
the real deal for him and Holly.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.962
I need to make sure you want
to be with her forever.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.530
How the fuck would I know?

09:57.596 --> 10:00.232
Ready?
Last chance.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.237
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:07.640 --> 10:07.840
.

10:10.376 --> 10:10.576
.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.653
Who just rang, like?
Anna.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.455
Oh, God. Bitch.

10:22.521 --> 10:24.757
Anna tells us that we've gotta work,

10:24.824 --> 10:28.260
which is shit, and to make
matters worse, Kyle's gotta leave.

10:28.327 --> 10:31.097
Now I've gotta break the news
to everybody else.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.798
Right, so, two things.

10:32.865 --> 10:37.103
Right, we've got the biggest beach
party in Ayia Napa,

10:37.169 --> 10:41.507
Anna's expecting loads of guests,
so she wants us on top form.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.175
Second thing...

10:43.242 --> 10:45.945
Nathan looks worried.
What is going on?

10:46.012 --> 10:47.246
She said... Oh, God.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.716
She said, "Is Kyle still there?"

10:50.783 --> 10:54.086
I was like, "Yeah." And she went,
"Tell him he shouldn't be."

10:54.153 --> 10:57.523
"You need to pack your stuff,
cos you're on the next flight out."

10:57.590 --> 10:58.958
Fuck off.
Swear down.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.760
What the fuck, Anna?

11:00.826 --> 11:03.295
Seriously?
Yeah, she just said that.

11:03.362 --> 11:07.767
Oh, shit. Holly is not gonna
take this very well at all.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.802
What the hell?
Did I hear that right?

11:09.869 --> 11:12.104
Kyle's gotta go, like, now?

11:16.642 --> 11:20.246
Everyone is gobsmacked.
No-one can even speak.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.680
(Holly crying)

11:21.747 --> 11:22.948
I'm so upset.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.917
I love this family so much.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.919
But I've gotta leave again.

11:26.986 --> 11:29.455
I don't understand why
I can't be part of it.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.690
I feel like this is Greece
all over again.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.959
Watching Kyle leave
and not going with him

11:34.026 --> 11:37.329
was probably the hardest thing
that has ever happened to me.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.433
And I will never, ever let him
do that again by himself.

11:47.239 --> 11:50.609
I don't understand. I thought
Holly and Kyle were just friends.

11:50.676 --> 11:54.246
So if they leave together,
does that mean they are together?

11:54.313 --> 11:58.384
I'm gutted that Kyle's going, but
I'm more devastated for them two.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.186
This is awful.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.921
Not only is Kyle going,

12:01.987 --> 12:04.190
Holly cannot leave with him as well.

12:06.092 --> 12:07.726
We've been through this once.

12:07.793 --> 12:11.597
I'll never, ever, ever let you
go through that alone again.

12:13.165 --> 12:17.603
Last time this happened, like,
I though I'd lost you forever.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.605
Back in Greece, the family decided

12:19.672 --> 12:21.774
that either me or Kyle had to leave,

12:21.841 --> 12:24.009
cos they couldn't deal
with us arguing.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.612
Kyle left
and it absolutely killed us.

12:26.679 --> 12:29.982
This time, I'm leaving with him
to show him how much I love him.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.917
I'm not forcing you out, you know.

12:31.984 --> 12:35.121
If you wanna stay, you can stay.
It's not your choice.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.423
I'm not asking Holly
to leave with us.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.926
It just means the world
that she would walk out with us.

12:46.232 --> 12:49.268
She's willing to leave.
They're not even together,

12:49.335 --> 12:51.704
but she's willing to leave with him.

12:51.770 --> 12:57.009
I'm confused. That just proves
she loves him to bits.

12:57.076 --> 13:01.080
Holly might love Kyle,
but she's taking a massive risk.

13:01.147 --> 13:03.382
Given the fact
they're not even together,

13:03.449 --> 13:06.285
and she still hasn't told Kyle
how she feels yet.

13:08.854 --> 13:13.058
I genuinely don't want you to go,
I think you're making a mistake.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.227
I know Holly wants to leave
for good,

13:15.294 --> 13:19.365
but I hope me and Marnie can change
her mind. There's still time.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.467
I know yous think
I'm making a mistake.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.436
My feelings for him
haven't changed since Greece.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.372
I'm still madly in love with him.

13:26.438 --> 13:28.974
If I was to let Kyle walk out
that door without me,

13:29.041 --> 13:32.344
I know there's not a chance in hell
we'd be able to make it work.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.646
I need to leave with him.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.815
This is the worst thing you can do.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.717
You're making a mistake. I did it.

13:38.784 --> 13:40.786
I thought
it was the love of my life.

13:40.853 --> 13:44.089
I've made the same mistake before
and I was engaged.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.858
And I still regretted it.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.459
So I know Holly will.

13:47.526 --> 13:50.963
I can't let this happen again,
I nearly lost him.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.831
Are you gonna be with him forever?

13:53.832 --> 13:55.801
I see a future with him.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.405
I have to ask Kyle if it's
definitely the real deal with Holly

13:59.471 --> 14:01.607
before I let her walk out and leave.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.843
Are you gonna let her leave?
Do you wanna be with her forever?

14:04.910 --> 14:07.413
Listen, she's made that decision.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.949
Marnie's asking
if I'll be with Holly forever.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.483
How the fuck would I know?

14:11.550 --> 14:14.286
I need to make sure
you wanna be with her forever.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.854
How can I say forever?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.690
I think you should tell her that.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.759
This boy is a fucking nightmare.

14:20.826 --> 14:23.762
He still can't give us
a straight answer about Holly

14:23.829 --> 14:26.565
when she's about to make
the worst decision ever.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.768
I love yous both and I want you
to make the right decision.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.909
I've had such an amazing time.

14:38.510 --> 14:42.047
Honestly, Nathan, you've literally
been my rock through all this.

14:42.114 --> 14:44.450
I understand exactly
how Holly's feeling.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.620
She's seen Kyle leave before.
I just hope she doesn't go.

14:47.686 --> 14:48.754
Ah. Watch my nipple

14:58.330 --> 15:00.866
I can't believe
what's just happened.

15:00.933 --> 15:02.101
I'm in shock.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.770
I know Holly's upset,
but I hope she doesn't go

15:04.837 --> 15:05.938
and leave with Kyle.

15:06.005 --> 15:09.608
To make matters worse, we have to
get ready and go to work.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.077
Heavy?
It's heavy as fuck.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.347
Oh, God.

15:16.348 --> 15:19.084
Ready?
Last chance.

15:19.151 --> 15:20.352
Never.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.856
Right. OK.

15:23.922 --> 15:26.225
I can't believe
I'm about to face the family

15:26.292 --> 15:28.260
and tell them I'm leaving for good.

15:28.327 --> 15:29.662
I'm dreading this.

15:29.728 --> 15:32.564
Right. Come on.
Let's go and tell them.

15:40.906 --> 15:43.542
Hi.
All right?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.344
I hope Holly's seen some sense

15:45.411 --> 15:48.480
and decided to stay with the family
and not leave with Kyle.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.282
Today, Gary, me and you spoke,

15:50.349 --> 15:53.986
about how you need to grow some
balls and admit how you feel.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.523
I've had the most amazing time
on this trip.

15:57.589 --> 16:00.926
But when Kyle came back,
I realised that...

16:00.993 --> 16:03.262
I can't live in this house
without him.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.998
I want him to be there.
And if he can't be,

16:06.065 --> 16:07.399
then I can't be neither.

16:07.466 --> 16:10.436
And we've decided that...

16:12.237 --> 16:14.373
...I'm going with him.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.476
What? Did I hear that right?

16:18.744 --> 16:23.048
Whoa. You both can't leave.
You can't take Holly, I need her.

16:29.254 --> 16:33.158
I may not agree with Holly leaving
for Kyle, but that's her decision.

16:33.225 --> 16:36.061
I just hope she doesn't
look back and regret it.

16:36.128 --> 16:39.798
It's a big decision to make and,
like, you can't just be here forever

16:39.865 --> 16:44.303
and if you wanna go with Kyle, like,
I totally, totally understand

16:44.370 --> 16:47.973
and it's, honestly,
we've had the best five years.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.609
Me and Gary have been
in this house since day one.

16:50.676 --> 16:55.013
We've been through the happiest time
and the worst times.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.916
But through all of it,
we've been through it together

16:57.983 --> 17:00.686
and it's gonna be strange
walking away from that.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.188
Thank you for being my big brother.

17:07.826 --> 17:11.563
I wasn't proud of the person who
walked in that door five years ago,

17:11.630 --> 17:13.298
over the years, I've grown.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.769
I've had so many laughs,
I've had me heart broken,

17:16.835 --> 17:19.438
I've made best friends for life.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.875
Just cos I'm walking out,
doesn't mean that will change.

17:27.746 --> 17:29.815
Don't worry,
please try and have fun.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.920
This might be
the most weird, strange,

17:34.987 --> 17:38.857
fucked up, incestuous family
in the entire world,

17:38.924 --> 17:40.859
but I love them.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.861
Right. Love yous all.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.664
I'm absolutely gutted
we've got to leave,

17:45.731 --> 17:49.535
but I can't believe Holly's choosing
me over the house this time.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.847
I can't believe Holly's
decided to leave with Kyle.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.882
I just hope she doesn't regret that.

18:05.350 --> 18:07.653
I don't understand,
are you coming away...

18:23.635 --> 18:27.105
I'm walking out of this house
with somebody I love.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.375
And somebody who
I clearly can't live without.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.546
I'm just so excited to see
what the next chapter is.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.602
Fuck it, let's get pissed
and celebrate.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.638
Holly might not be here,
but she's not forgotten.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.944
If one thing's gonna cheer me up,
it's tits.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.548
Chloe, show these girls
how fucking Geordies do it.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.885
It's like some low budget version
of Dirty Dancing

19:12.951 --> 19:14.720
It's quite cute.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.356
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

19:20.125 --> 19:20.325
.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.061
.

19:23.128 --> 19:26.798
'This part has got loads more talk
about sex, as well as sexual scenes

19:26.865 --> 19:28.567
and the usual strong language.'

19:28.634 --> 19:31.103
'Stop watching if it isn't for you,
but if it is,

19:31.169 --> 19:33.839
you're in for a treat. Howay.'

19:39.545 --> 19:42.581
I feel like we can't really
disrespect her decision.

19:42.648 --> 19:45.984
If she wants to do that
and it makes her happy, so be it.

19:46.051 --> 19:47.819
I just can't believe she's gone.

19:47.886 --> 19:50.789
But does he love her?

19:50.856 --> 19:55.160
I can't believe that Holly
has just left for good for Kyle.

19:55.227 --> 19:58.497
I think she's making
a terrible mistake.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.600
And now Anna wants us to go to work.
Cheer, Anna.

20:01.667 --> 20:05.771
So, fuck it, let's just get pissed
and celebrate.

20:05.837 --> 20:09.708
If Holly and Kyle leaving isn't
bad enough, we've gotta go out,

20:09.775 --> 20:11.777
work and try and have a good time.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.512
It's gonna be impossible.

20:17.416 --> 20:21.253
This beach party looks amazing
and I know everyone's feeling down,

20:21.320 --> 20:24.890
but I feel like this is exactly
what we need to cheer us up.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.565
Today, I'm not gonna do
one bit of work.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.268
You know what...
I'm gonna have fun for Holly.

20:36.335 --> 20:39.838
Marnie's right, there's no way
I'm working after Holly's left.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.574
So, Anna, this one's for you.

20:42.641 --> 20:43.909
Fuck off!

20:43.976 --> 20:45.477
I hate her!

20:45.544 --> 20:48.347
She is a big, slag bastard.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.282
You just went in on Anna there.

20:50.349 --> 20:53.418
Holly might not be here,
but she's not forgotten.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.888
We're gonna have a good time for
her, it's what she'd have wanted.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.491
Let's get drunk, come on!
Bitch. She's a bitch.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.593
She is a sly bitch.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.509
The reason I've apologised
to Marty is, with Holly gone,

21:17.576 --> 21:20.078
I've realised friendships
are important,

21:20.145 --> 21:23.048
and I don't want to risk
our friendship any more.

21:29.755 --> 21:34.292
When will Chloe get the message?
We're just friends! Just friends.

22:10.595 --> 22:13.999
Wet T-shirt competition.
Get your chebbs out for the lads!

22:16.134 --> 22:18.003
Oi!

22:26.311 --> 22:30.182
If there's one thing that's gonna
cheer me up, it's tits.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.483
Twenty tits!

22:31.550 --> 22:33.719
Nathan, are you doing
this competition?

22:36.254 --> 22:40.225
Looks like my grieving period's
over, this beach party's too good.

22:48.233 --> 22:52.704
Move over, girls,
let me show you how you do sexy.

22:54.005 --> 22:57.242
Go on, Nathan! Nathan! Nathan!

22:57.309 --> 23:00.078
Trust Chloe and Marnie
to pick the only girls in Napa

23:00.145 --> 23:03.181
who don't get the concept
of a wet T-shirt competition.

23:03.248 --> 23:06.852
Somebody needs to show 'em how
it's done. I know just the person.

23:06.918 --> 23:10.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's Chloe? Chloe!

23:10.255 --> 23:14.326
Chloe, please show these girls
how fucking Geordies do it.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.995
Right now, Chloe, go!

23:24.770 --> 23:26.938
I'm soaking wet,
and I'm smashing this.

23:27.005 --> 23:29.040
You could say I'm a natural.

23:33.845 --> 23:37.749
Chloe's good at getting her tits
out, but she's shit at dancing.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.485
I'm gonna have to step in
and help her out.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.024
Gary, look at Marty!

23:46.091 --> 23:50.095
Marty jumps in like a little hero
to help her get through it.

23:50.162 --> 23:53.932
It's like some sort of low budget
version of Dirty Dancing.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.066
It's quite cute.

23:56.234 --> 23:58.637
I'm absolutely mortal,
and I do not care.

23:58.703 --> 24:02.040
I'm gonna flirt my arse off with
Marty if he likes it or not.

24:05.310 --> 24:07.012
We're having a wicked time,

24:07.078 --> 24:10.148
but I can't help thinking
Holly would have loved this.

24:18.123 --> 24:22.227
Kyle and Holly might have left, but
this beach party was what we needed.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.229
Thanks, Anna. Bitch.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.803
That looks fun.
Room for a little 'un?

24:34.439 --> 24:36.374
Fuck me, what the fuck was that?

24:37.475 --> 24:39.678
Oh, hello, Gary.

24:43.415 --> 24:47.919
All right, it's been an amazing day.
Geordies, let's fuck off.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.560
I didn't think anything
was gonna cheer us up,

24:55.627 --> 24:59.264
but that beach party sorted us
all out. We had a good time.

25:05.303 --> 25:08.573
Get back to the villa, pool time!

25:08.640 --> 25:12.010
Chloe is going
straight in the deep end.

25:14.846 --> 25:19.050
Shit, we've only went
and hoyed Chloe without the armbands!

25:21.119 --> 25:24.189
(shouting)

25:24.256 --> 25:26.424
Standard,
Aaron's trying to get us wet.

25:31.229 --> 25:34.933
Oh, shit, here's Nathan. The size
of him, he's gonna empty the pool.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.478
That's what you'd feed a rabbit.

25:46.544 --> 25:49.014
That slice of lettuce.
I still eat it.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.983
Despite Holly leaving,
we actually had a wicked day.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.786
Now, all that's left to do
is have some scran,

25:54.853 --> 25:56.688
raise a toast and get to bed.

25:56.755 --> 26:01.192
Oh, right. Yes, Kyle came and went,
but the main thing is Holly.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.931
Everyone raise a bit of food...
Everyone raise a chip!

26:05.997 --> 26:09.000
We've all had
far too much peeve today,

26:09.067 --> 26:11.102
so let's make a toast to Holly

26:11.169 --> 26:14.105
with a fucking fried potato.

26:14.172 --> 26:17.042
(all) To Holly.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.445
And Kyle!

26:20.512 --> 26:23.281
It's been a really emotional day.
Holly's gone.

26:23.348 --> 26:27.252
I'm needy. I just want cuddles. I'm
going to the shag pad with Aaron.

26:47.706 --> 26:49.975
Feels weird being in this bed alone.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.943
Me too. I'm in bed alone, too.

26:52.010 --> 26:55.847
I've just woke up and I can't believe
Holly's not here for the last day.

26:55.914 --> 26:58.316
But I'm still gonna make it special,

26:58.383 --> 27:00.919
cos it's what Holly
would have wanted.

27:00.986 --> 27:04.489
Are you feeling better this morning?
I spoke to Martin.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.726
He's scared, cos he doesn't want
to lose the friendship.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.694
I'm so glad
me and Marty are friends,

27:09.761 --> 27:13.498
and I'm determined
to make our last day amazing.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.767
Where's Marns?
With Aaron.

27:15.834 --> 27:16.968
In the shag pad?

27:17.035 --> 27:19.838
Shall we go to the balcony
and surprise them?

27:24.476 --> 27:29.180
It's the last day and I'm gonna
wake them with a ballet performance.

27:29.247 --> 27:32.017
Just call me Angelina the ballerina.

27:32.083 --> 27:35.653
One, two and point de barre
and plie.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.656
I love Chloe, but sometimes
I wish she'd just fuck off.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.625
This is one of them times.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.497
Come on, wake up!

27:45.563 --> 27:48.466
Well, that didn't work.
How about a song?

27:48.533 --> 27:51.336
# Ayia! Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

27:51.403 --> 27:53.938
# Ayia! Ayia! #
Ow!

27:54.005 --> 27:57.575
Fucking heavy.
You've smashed the bed. Oopsies.

27:57.642 --> 28:00.345
Oh, my God. I've literally had
an hour's sleep.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.080
(farts)
Marnie, man!

28:02.147 --> 28:04.482
Sorry.
(both laugh)

28:04.549 --> 28:05.817
It's the last morning

28:05.884 --> 28:09.988
and I can't believe me and Aaron
have made it to the end as a couple.

28:11.256 --> 28:14.359
There was one point where
I didn't think we'd speak again.

28:14.426 --> 28:16.861
Which point was that?
Was it when you said

28:16.928 --> 28:20.999
you'd never, ever,
ever speak to us again?

28:21.066 --> 28:24.269
If I'm honest, there was times
I thought we wouldn't make it.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.504
But I'm so glad
we're in such a good place.

28:26.571 --> 28:28.706
(fart, laughter)

28:28.773 --> 28:31.242
Marnie, man!

28:31.309 --> 28:34.112
Aaron! That fucking stinks.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.986
I'm fucked.

28:42.053 --> 28:45.490
It's fucking... It's mad.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.159
Walking in this house
with eight people.

28:48.226 --> 28:49.761
People come and people go,

28:49.828 --> 28:53.164
but I didn't think I'd be
the last one left.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.166
I've woke up, it's the last day.

28:55.233 --> 28:59.003
And I'm the only one from
the original eight that's left.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.972
That is fucking mental.

29:01.039 --> 29:05.076
I can't believe it.
It's the last night tonight.

29:05.143 --> 29:08.646
Do you know how it is?
I've fucking loved it.

29:08.713 --> 29:12.383
I know I say it every day
that I have the best day of my life,

29:12.450 --> 29:16.254
but today I actually want it
to be the best day of my life.

29:16.321 --> 29:19.624
I've had the best time of my life
being away with these radgies.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.960
I can't believe
we're going back tomorrow.

29:22.026 --> 29:26.364
But I'm determined to make
this last day the best day ever.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.233
(laughs) Best day of my life.

29:33.972 --> 29:37.408
I swear the sun makes you feel worse
when you're hungover.

29:37.475 --> 29:39.344
I'm weak. The sun makes me weak.

29:40.745 --> 29:43.414
It's the last day and I want to do
something special

29:43.481 --> 29:45.116
and I know just the thing.

29:45.183 --> 29:48.319
I reckon, leave the girls here
and go cliff diving.

29:48.386 --> 29:49.921
Take Nathan as well.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.157
He is one of the boys
and he's coming.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.893
Nathan will be shitting himself.

29:54.959 --> 29:58.363
We'll get ready, you tell Nathan.
I'll go tell him.

29:58.429 --> 30:01.166
Oh, shit, sorry, mate.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.668
This was a mint idea, I cannot wait.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.271
Howay, Nathan, let's go,
you're gonna love this.

30:09.908 --> 30:12.677
The lads have invited us
to go cliff diving with them.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.245
Really?

30:14.312 --> 30:16.014
I'm not sure about this.

30:20.485 --> 30:24.088
Get to the cliffs and these things
are fucking high, you know?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.857
I cannot wait.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.759
This is the spot here, lads.

30:27.825 --> 30:32.096
Oh, my fucking God.
Are you having a laugh?

30:32.163 --> 30:34.365
There's no way I'm jumping off this.

30:34.432 --> 30:37.769
Nathan are you jumping off?
No. No. No. Why? No.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.574
Come on, Nathan, are you really
that much of a wimp?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.108
It's not even that high.

30:44.175 --> 30:46.477
I feel sick just being stood here.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.580
I'm buzzing the lads invited us,

30:48.646 --> 30:52.383
but this looks like something you
jump off if you're having a bad day.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.153
Please be careful.
I'm scared for you.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.757
I turned around for two seconds,
and that mad bastard, Gaz,

30:59.824 --> 31:03.828
has jumped off the cliff
and he's flying through the air.

31:07.832 --> 31:10.134
That was fucking amazing!

31:10.201 --> 31:13.238
Your turn, Marty.
Time to prove you're a man.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.241
Martin, be careful.

31:19.644 --> 31:22.180
That was fucking wicked!

31:22.247 --> 31:24.349
Fucking hell, man!

31:24.415 --> 31:27.852
Now that Marty's gone, there's no
way I can get out of this.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.187
See ya later, Nathan.

31:29.254 --> 31:32.490
Aaron! Aaron!

31:37.095 --> 31:40.565
There's no way in fucking hell
that I'm jumping off that.

31:41.766 --> 31:43.801
Do it, man.
No, I enjoyed watching you.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.503
Honestly, Nathan, it's good.

31:45.570 --> 31:49.040
Nathan is shitting himself,
but I'm not leaving till he's jumped.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.777
I've spotted another little place
that would be perfect for him.

31:52.844 --> 31:56.047
Nathan, from down there.

31:56.114 --> 31:58.016
I could jump off that one.
Go on then.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.918
I can't come cliff diving
and not jump off something.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.454
I'm gonna jump off the little one.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.089
How the fuck do I get down?

32:05.156 --> 32:07.859
(foghorn)
Fucking brilliant.

32:07.925 --> 32:11.696
Great. If things aren't bad enough
that I've gotta do the baby jump.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.232
A boat load of pensioners
have just turned up.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.468
This is embarrassing as fuck,

32:17.535 --> 32:20.405
even them old people
are calling you a bitch.

32:21.873 --> 32:24.942
I'm looking down,
and it's fucking high.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.477
I'm shitting myself.

32:27.412 --> 32:30.548
Nathan, why won't you
just jump into some water?

32:34.986 --> 32:37.255
I can't believe I survived that.

32:37.322 --> 32:40.625
It was fun, but I won't be
doing it again in a hurry.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.229
(cheering)

32:47.632 --> 32:49.934
That was fucking wicked.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.537
Even Nathan did it.
Well, off the kiddy step.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.839
Let's go and get ready
for our last night.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.508
Nathan, ice cream's on you.
That's fine.

32:57.575 --> 33:00.211
Don't be scared, though.
Of the ice cream man?

33:01.212 --> 33:03.848
It's our last night
and we have to make it a good one.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.386
Me and Chloe are getting on
like we used to.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.521
I'm feeling the love right now.

33:10.588 --> 33:12.423
The night hasn't ended just yet.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.827
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:18.596 --> 33:18.796
.

33:21.332 --> 33:21.532
.

33:21.599 --> 33:23.901
'This part contains more
strong language,

33:23.968 --> 33:26.504
sex talk, scenes,
plus aggressive behaviour.'

33:26.571 --> 33:30.074
'If that's not for you, turn over.
You've been warned.'

33:35.613 --> 33:37.181
Nice one. Nice little number.

33:37.248 --> 33:38.983
It's exactly the same as mine.

33:39.050 --> 33:41.185
Yours is exactly the same as mine.

33:41.252 --> 33:43.755
You can't wear that.
Aaron only had two shirts.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.895
Maybe it's good that it's the
last night and we're going home

33:50.962 --> 33:54.999
cos these two have clearly been
spending too much time together.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.836
Right. Howay. Finish getting ready
and we can get pissed.

34:01.839 --> 34:05.042
Nathan, if you spend any more time
in that shower,

34:05.109 --> 34:06.978
you will look like a fucking prune.

34:07.044 --> 34:09.847
Get out, get ready
and put a fucking shirt on.

34:09.914 --> 34:12.583
It's our last night and we have to
make it a good one.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.585
I have had the most amazing time

34:14.652 --> 34:17.054
and tonight we're gonna go out
with a bang.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.956
Oh, look, it went in the pool!

34:20.024 --> 34:21.826
People came and people left,

34:21.893 --> 34:24.829
but there's six of us here now,
so tonight is about us.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.732
So, cheers to us,
let's have a wicked last night.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.900
(all) Cheers!

34:28.966 --> 34:31.768
It's the last night, let's have it!

34:31.835 --> 34:35.672
(all chanting)
Ayia! Ayia! Ayia fucking Napa!

34:38.009 --> 34:40.812
I bet tonight is the best night
we're gonna have ever.

34:40.878 --> 34:44.081
Marty, what do you reckon?
Best night of our life.

34:47.284 --> 34:50.254
We get to the club,
and everyone's in such a good mood.

34:50.321 --> 34:52.924
We're gonna make tonight amazing.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.665
I've always loved the last night,

35:00.731 --> 35:04.035
cos it's all about having fun
with the family. Let's do this!

35:23.321 --> 35:26.924
Best friends can tell each other
exactly what you don't want to hear.

35:26.991 --> 35:30.895
It might hurt in the short term, but
in the long run it's for the best.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.836
This time round,
I have kicked off a lot.

35:38.903 --> 35:41.639
But I feel like you have to
learn from your mistakes.

35:41.706 --> 35:44.575
And they're mistakes
I will not be going back on.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.725
Me and Gaz have come
a long way since last time.

36:00.791 --> 36:03.094
To be where we are now is amazing.

36:05.029 --> 36:08.533
Me and Marty haven't always seen
eye to eye, but with Scott gone,

36:08.599 --> 36:11.936
Aaron doing his disappearing act,
we've become good mates.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.105
To be honest,
he's made this trip for me.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.316
The last time me and Aaron were in
this club, we weren't even speaking.

36:26.717 --> 36:29.654
It's been a long time coming,
but we're in a good place.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.924
And I'm really enjoying
having her as my girlfriend.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.643
This time round,
I've really missed Charlotte.

36:52.710 --> 36:57.281
And I now know what I've gotta do.
I hope it's not too late.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.425
Gaz is my best mate
and he's always been there for us

37:07.491 --> 37:08.726
when it comes to Marnie.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.828
I know how much
he's missed Charlotte,

37:10.895 --> 37:13.998
I just hope when he gets home,
he can give things another go.

37:28.546 --> 37:33.584
There's been times I thought
I'd never look at Chloe again.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.987
Now me and Chloe are getting on
like we used to

37:36.053 --> 37:38.789
it's made us realise
how much I missed her.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.800
I do still really like Marty,

37:49.867 --> 37:52.403
but maybe he's right.
We should just be friends.

37:52.470 --> 37:53.504
For now.

38:01.445 --> 38:04.682
Last night, everyone's getting on,
necking loads of drinks

38:04.749 --> 38:07.318
and it actually feels
like a proper family.

38:11.055 --> 38:13.491
Our family is fucked up.

38:13.557 --> 38:16.560
But to be honest, I wouldn't
change them for anything.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.330
And tonight,
we're having a wicked night.

38:20.631 --> 38:24.068
We've had the most amazing night,
we've had such a good time

38:24.135 --> 38:27.638
and we're getting along so well
and the night hasn't ended yet.

38:30.107 --> 38:34.078
It's time to leave the club and
Nathan wants us to go to the beach.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.114
It sounds like the perfect end
to an amazing experience.

38:48.125 --> 38:50.061
I couldn't ask for a better end.

38:50.127 --> 38:52.396
Watching the sunrise with my family.

38:52.463 --> 38:54.198
It's so special to us.

38:54.265 --> 38:59.136
Nathan, the sunrise, in words,
sounds like a good idea,

38:59.203 --> 39:00.805
but I'm knackered.

39:00.871 --> 39:04.141
I know, but howay.
We'd never do it in Newcastle.

39:04.208 --> 39:07.678
Where would you sit for the sunrise
in Newcastle? The Tyne bridge?

39:07.745 --> 39:11.348
After everything
that's went on on this trip,

39:11.415 --> 39:14.485
being here with these lot
right now is amazing.

39:14.552 --> 39:18.022
And I wouldn't rather be
anywhere else in the full universe.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.825
We're gonna go back to Newcastle,
do it all again,

39:20.891 --> 39:22.727
and it's gonna be us six walking in.

39:22.793 --> 39:25.463
I feel proud of us.
I do as well.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.332
Tonight, honestly,
standing on that bar dancing...

39:28.399 --> 39:31.302
We were just loving life.
It was fucking amazing.

39:31.368 --> 39:33.370
What was tonight for you?

39:33.437 --> 39:36.040
Best night of my life.
(laughter)

39:36.107 --> 39:39.844
Yous, I've just seen something
and had a wicked idea.

39:39.910 --> 39:41.479
I've had a brilliant idea.

39:41.545 --> 39:45.249
We're gonna make wishes, put them in
a bottle and throw them in the sea.

39:45.316 --> 39:47.718
Right has anyone got
something to write on?

39:47.785 --> 39:50.321
Why?
We gotta put a wish in here

39:50.387 --> 39:51.622
and throw it in the sea.

39:51.689 --> 39:53.624
What a brilliant idea, Nathan.

39:53.691 --> 39:55.126
I love making wishes.

39:55.192 --> 39:57.294
Hopefully this one will come true.

39:57.361 --> 40:01.732
Everyone write a wish that you want
for next time we come back. OK.

40:01.799 --> 40:06.137
I'm wishing me, Chloe, Marty
and Aaron can go on a double date.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.838
And Marty actually mean it.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.240
I'm doing it for Chloe.

40:09.306 --> 40:12.610
I am the most selfless
best friend anyone could ask for.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.881
I wished for Marnie
to remain my girlfriend.

40:16.947 --> 40:20.451
Cos when we get on,
we make each other so happy.

40:21.719 --> 40:25.055
After having such a good night
and everyone coming together,

40:25.122 --> 40:27.124
I want it to be
like this all the time.

40:27.191 --> 40:29.760
So I'm wishing for us
to be a happy family.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.864
I'm wishing that me and Marty
will be together,

40:33.931 --> 40:36.200
cos I know I still really like him.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.370
And I'm hoping that things
will be different next time.

40:40.638 --> 40:42.907
My wish is that
Sophie and Holly come back,

40:42.973 --> 40:45.743
cos they made my time
with the girls extra special.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.545
I miss them so much already.

40:48.312 --> 40:50.748
I wished for Charlotte
to be here next time.

40:50.815 --> 40:54.385
Her not being here has made me
realise how much I miss her.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.987
I would do anything
to have her back.

40:57.054 --> 41:01.792
I'm feeling the love, so it's time
to get these wishes out to sea.

41:06.363 --> 41:10.334
To the six of us,
and may all our wishes come true.

41:18.008 --> 41:21.445
Here's to the start
of a wicked summer!

41:21.512 --> 41:24.548
This has been a trip like no other.

41:24.615 --> 41:27.451
The biggest party islands!

41:27.518 --> 41:28.586
Magaluf.

41:28.652 --> 41:29.653
(cheering)

41:29.720 --> 41:31.856
I'm in a bad way.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.757
Ibiza.
What the fuck?

41:33.824 --> 41:35.726
(shouts)
Kavos.

41:35.793 --> 41:37.494
(shouting)

41:38.495 --> 41:39.797
Napa.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.332
(screaming)

41:41.398 --> 41:42.867
That fucking kills!

41:42.933 --> 41:44.468
Put that thing away!

41:45.469 --> 41:47.338
We've said hello to old mates.

41:47.404 --> 41:50.007
Who's your fucking baby?

41:50.074 --> 41:51.442
Guess who's fucking back?

41:51.508 --> 41:53.644
Oh, my God, it's Kyle!

41:54.645 --> 41:56.013
Too many goodbyes.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.182
I'm foaming with you, Chloe.

41:58.249 --> 42:01.585
I want out. This is the end
of the Geordie Shore family for me.

42:01.652 --> 42:04.722
I can't let this happen again,
I nearly lost him.

42:04.788 --> 42:08.092
I can't believe Holly's decided
to leave with Kyle.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.263
We've had the best time.

42:12.329 --> 42:14.698
Bosh!

42:14.765 --> 42:17.501
Since when did Nathan
turn in to a Creme Egg?

42:17.568 --> 42:19.370
And pretty shit times.

42:19.436 --> 42:21.572
(screaming)
Fucking little slag!

42:23.240 --> 42:25.409
Chicken fucking nuggets?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.977
(shouting)

42:27.044 --> 42:28.545
I hate him so much.

42:30.414 --> 42:32.283
(weeping)

42:32.349 --> 42:35.052
Is it not...
(screaming)

42:35.119 --> 42:38.322
We may be one weird,
fucked up family...

42:38.389 --> 42:39.757
What the fuck?
Oh, shit.

42:39.823 --> 42:41.492
(screaming)

42:41.558 --> 42:43.560
...but we always come back together.

42:43.627 --> 42:44.695
(screaming)

42:44.762 --> 42:46.830
Here's Nathan.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.833
Mortal!

42:50.734 --> 42:53.971
Cos deep down,
we fucking love each other.

42:55.606 --> 42:57.708
Give us a cuddle.

42:59.643 --> 43:01.979
Please don't come back to shore.
Fuck off.

43:02.046 --> 43:04.815
As the sun rises,
there's only one thing to do...

43:04.882 --> 43:06.784
Get naked and get in the sea!

43:06.850 --> 43:08.319
Skinny dipping time!

43:08.385 --> 43:12.323
(shouting)

43:12.389 --> 43:16.327
(splashing)

43:54.064 --> 43:54.264
.
