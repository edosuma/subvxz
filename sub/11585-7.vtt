00:01.435 --> 00:02.703
(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.736 --> 00:05.739
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.476
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.509 --> 00:10.344
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.378 --> 00:11.712
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.745 --> 00:13.747
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.350
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.685
(man)
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:17.718 --> 00:19.387
(woman)
DID ANYONE SEE
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.388
OH, MY GOD.
[heavy breathing]

00:20.421 --> 00:22.290
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
A BLANKET OR SOMETHING?

00:22.323 --> 00:23.557
WAS HE HIT BY A CAR?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.094
I THOUGHT
I HEARD A GUNSHOT.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.362
ANYONE HAVE A CELL PHONE?

00:28.396 --> 00:31.199
SIR, SIR.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

00:31.232 --> 00:33.601
JUST HOLD ON.
THE AMBULANCE IS COMING.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.103
[distant siren wails]

00:35.136 --> 00:37.605
STAY WITH ME, PAL.
STAY WITH ME.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.740
[heavy breathing
continues]

00:39.773 --> 00:42.510
GSW TO THE LEFT ARM
AND INTO THE CHEST.

00:42.543 --> 00:43.711
SECOND ONE THROUGH
THE LEFT SHOULDER.

00:43.744 --> 00:44.745
LOST TWO PINTS OF BLOOD.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.548
CLEAR TRAUMA TWO.
I NEED O-NEG AND AN INFUSER.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.383
(woman)
I'LL CALL THE BLOOD BANK.

00:49.417 --> 00:52.153
GAUZE. FORCEPS.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.622
(nurse)
HEARTBEAT IS 180.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.158
BP, 150 OVER 100.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.359
I NEED TWO MORE UNITS
OF O-NEG.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.194
I'M HIS PARTNER.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.696
PAGE X-RAY.
WHERE'S THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.132
(man)
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.300
(woman)
FLUIDS ARE IN.
ALMOST 250 MORE.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.702
WE NEED ANOTHER...

02:07.361 --> 02:09.297
THE VICTIM IS A WHITE FEMALE,
LATE TEENS.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.332
TOOK ONE TO THE HEAD,
AND THAT'S JUST FOR STARTERS.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.302
DEEP LACERATIONS
TO THE NECK AND GENITAL AREA.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.904
COULD BE SEXUAL SADISM,
OR SOME KIND OF RITUAL.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.572
SO THE GUY GETS HIS JOLLIES
SLICIN' HER UP,

02:18.606 --> 02:19.840
THEN WHEN HE GETS BORED
HE CAPS HER?

02:19.873 --> 02:21.209
(Warner)
YOU THINK THAT'S PERVERSE,

02:21.242 --> 02:24.278
I FOUND SALIVA
NEAR THE SLASH WOUNDS.

02:24.312 --> 02:25.879
THE PERP LICKED HER?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.516
YEAH. SENT THE SICKO'S
SPIT TO THE LAB.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.451
OKAY. WE GOT A NAME?

02:30.484 --> 02:32.220
AH, THERE'S NO I.D.
GOT THIS CELL PHONE.

02:32.253 --> 02:35.756
NOTHING BUT BLOCKED
AND PRIVATE CALLS.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.392
IT'S A PROOF SHEET.

02:38.426 --> 02:42.330
SO WE'VE GOT A MODEL
OR AN ACTRESS HERE, HUH?

02:42.363 --> 02:44.565
(Benson)
OH, GOD.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.534
LOOK AT THIS.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.570
THAT'S A HELL OF A PLACE
TO KEEP A PET.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.339
THE PERP WHACKED
THE PARAKEET, TOO?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.806
(Stabler)
MAYBE IT'S SOME
KIND OF MOB WARNING.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.442
DEAD BIRD CAN'T SING.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.709
SURE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

02:55.743 --> 02:57.978
WHAT KIND OF WEAPON
MADE THOSE NECK WOUNDS.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.447
(Warner)
TEETH.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.249
THE BLOOD SMEAR

03:01.282 --> 03:02.983
FROM THE VICTIM'S NECK
AND GENITAL WOUNDS

03:03.016 --> 03:05.486
SHOWS AEROBIC
GRAM-NEGATIVE BACILLI--

03:05.519 --> 03:07.621
A BACTERIA COMMONLY
FOUND IN DOG BITES.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.490
A STRAY MUST HAVE
GOTTEN TO HER.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.292
SHOT, STABBED,
AND NOW A CHEW TOY.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.960
AND SOMETHING ELSE
GNAWED ON HER.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.228
A RAT?

03:14.262 --> 03:15.496
I DON'T KNOW.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.731
I FOUND A FOREIGN
STRAIN OF BACTERIA

03:17.765 --> 03:18.999
I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.768
SO I SENT IT TO
AN ANIMAL DNA LAB.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.236
SHOULD HAVE
THE RESULTS BACK SOON.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.305
ANYTHING ELSE?

03:24.338 --> 03:25.839
(Warner)
JUST THIS.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.575
(Stabler)
CIRCLE WITH AN "S."

03:27.608 --> 03:28.876
IT'S A VIP STAMP

03:28.909 --> 03:30.911
FROM AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB
CALLED SUPPLE.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.313
MICHAEL SOLANO
OWNS THAT PLACE.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.647
THE MOBSTER.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.849
YEAH, AND THE CLUB'S A BLOCK
AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENE.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.585
YEAH, SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE A COINCIDENCE.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.587
I'LL SHOW
OUR VICTIM'S HEADSHOTS

03:39.620 --> 03:40.854
TO THE TOP
MODELING AGENCIES,

03:40.888 --> 03:41.989
SEE IF I CAN GET AN I.D.

03:42.022 --> 03:42.790
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GRAB FIN.

03:42.823 --> 03:44.858
HE KNOWS
THE AFTER-HOUR CLUB SCENE.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.302
7:00 A.M.--DON'T
THESE LADIES EVER SLEEP?

03:54.335 --> 03:55.869
PROBABLY MORE THAN YOU.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.571
PROBABLY GET MORE, TOO.

03:57.605 --> 04:01.309
SOMEBODY COOKIN' BACON?
I SMELL A PIG.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.776
[grunts]
MAYBE YOU NEED
YOUR NOSE ADJUSTED.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.044
ALL RIGHT.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.280
YOU KNOW HER?

04:06.314 --> 04:07.548
HOPE YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO SET ME UP WITH HER.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.982
I'M IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP

04:09.016 --> 04:10.718
WITH TWO STRIPPERS.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.353
SHE WAS FOUND MURDERED
DOWN THE STREET.

04:12.386 --> 04:13.954
EXECUTION-STYLE.
HALF-BLOCK AWAY.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.389
WE FIGURED A MOB SCUMBAG
LIKE YOURSELF

04:15.423 --> 04:16.657
WOULD KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT HER.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.559
YOU FIGURED WRONG.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.927
THINK HARDER.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.662
YOUR VIP STAMP

04:21.695 --> 04:23.297
WAS ON HER HAND.

04:23.331 --> 04:25.032
GENTLEMEN,

04:25.065 --> 04:26.400
AS HARD
AS I TRY TO KNOW

04:26.434 --> 04:28.001
EVERY PRETTY GIRL
THAT COMES IN HERE,

04:28.035 --> 04:29.903
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

04:29.937 --> 04:33.040
BUT OSCAR PROBABLY HAS.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.643
HE'S MY WRANGLER.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.010
HE KEEPS YOUR CLUB
PACKED WITH HOTTIES.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.078
WHERE'S CASANOVA NOW?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.547
PROBABLY WAKING UP

04:39.580 --> 04:41.014
AND GETTING READY
TO HIT BOUTIQUE ROW.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.683
IT'S HIS
HAPPY HUNTING GROUND.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.952
(Stabler)
THANKS.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.321
(Fin)
THERE'S OSCAR.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.590
LARGER THAN LIFE
AND TWICE AS SLEAZY.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.325
JESUS, LORD, HAVE MERCY.
OH, MY SOUL.

04:51.359 --> 04:53.361
HEY, SWEETHEART,
HOW 'BOUT YOU, BABY?

04:53.394 --> 04:54.795
DOWN, BOY.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.330
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS?

04:56.364 --> 04:57.398
EH, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

04:57.431 --> 04:59.833
I'M NOT PRETTY ENOUGH
TO GET ONE OF YOUR CARDS,

04:59.867 --> 05:01.101
OSCAR ASSADORIAN,

05:01.134 --> 05:02.903
TALENT MANAGER?

05:02.936 --> 05:04.505
YOU CAN'T SPELL ASSADORIAN
WITHOUT "ASS," HUH?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.374
THAT WHAT YOU SELL?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.708
WHOA.
I'M NO PIMP.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.976
NO, YOU'RE
A BOTTOM FEEDER.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.978
YOU MANAGE HER?

05:11.011 --> 05:12.846
NATALIE BLEERS.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.482
I INTRODUCED HER
AROUND TOWN.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.650
WHERE DOES SHE LIVE?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.018
NASTY FLATS.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.654
CRASH PAD FOR MODELS
IN MIDTOWN.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.056
EACH KEY OPENS THE DOOR
TO AN APARTMENT

05:23.090 --> 05:24.458
FILLED
WITH BEAUTIFUL GIRLS.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.893
HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?

05:25.926 --> 05:28.061
EVEN LESS THAN BEFORE.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.597
OSCAR, BABY,
DID YOU BRING ME ANY?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.365
CIERRE SU BOCA,
REGINA.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.966
I MEANT LIQUOR.
[chuckles]

05:33.000 --> 05:34.635
THAT IS WHY
WE LOVE OSCAR,

05:34.668 --> 05:36.370
BECAUSE HE GETS US
INTO ALL THE BEST CLUBS

05:36.404 --> 05:37.671
AND HE GETS US
FREE DRINKS.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.939
YEAH,
WE LOVE OSCAR, TOO.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.674
WHO DECORATED THIS PLACE,
A TORNADO?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.710
OKAY, IT'S HARD
TO KEEP IT CLEAN

05:42.743 --> 05:45.479
WITH SO MANY GIRLS
COMING AND GOING.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.914
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
NATALIE CAME AND WENT?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.015
I DON'T KNOW,
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.483
HEY, IF YOU SEE HER,

05:49.517 --> 05:50.818
TELL HER I WANT THAT
50 BUCKS SHE OWES ME.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.152
(Fin)
YOU'LL BE WAITING
ON THAT A WHILE.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.153
SHE'S DEAD.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.157
SO DOES THAT MEAN
THAT I CAN HAVE HER CLOTHES?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.992
SWEET.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.961
YOU TWO MUST
HAVE BEEN CLOSE.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.532
BOSOM BUDDIES.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.534
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S EVIDENCE.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.671
HEY.
THIS NATALIE'S PHONE?

06:10.704 --> 06:12.940
YEAH.
WE ALREADY FOUND ONE
IN HER PURSE.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.675
WHAT'S A GIRL NEED
TWO CELL PHONES FOR?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.110
I DON'T KNOW, BUT SHE
SURE TALKED ON IT A LOT.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.086
FIN, COME HERE.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.154
ONLY ONE NUMBER DIALED,

06:27.187 --> 06:29.022
IN OR OUT.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.965
[cell phone rings]

06:37.998 --> 06:39.933
[silence]

06:39.967 --> 06:41.935
HELLO.

06:41.969 --> 06:42.936
[caller hangs up]

06:42.970 --> 06:43.937
GUESS THEY DON'T
WANT TO TALK.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.139
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS
THEIR CELL PHONE STAYS ON,

06:46.173 --> 06:47.441
WE CAN TRACK 'EM.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.179
HE'S HEADING ACROSS
14TH STREET, EL.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.082
ROGER THAT, LIV.
[beeping]

06:55.115 --> 06:56.517
HE JUST STOPPED.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.752
[beeps]

07:00.921 --> 07:04.958
(Benson)
JUST WENT INTO
POUNDING EZRA CAFE.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.727
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT--
I KNOW.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.995
I DON'T REALLY CARE.
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.162
WHY'D YOU
HANG UP ON ME?

07:09.196 --> 07:11.465
I--I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.834
TELL US ABOUT
YOUR FRIEND.
FRIEND?

07:13.867 --> 07:17.004
FIRST TIME I SAW HER
WAS LIKE A SECOND AGO.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.138
OH, REALLY?
WHERE?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.210
THERE SHE IS.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.615
DEAD GIRL WALKING?

07:29.182 --> 07:30.751
(Stabler)
YO.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.085
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.587
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

07:33.621 --> 07:34.855
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.189
SHE LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU?

07:36.223 --> 07:38.191
WHO ARE YOU?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.827
WE'RE THE POLICE.
WHO ARE YOU?

07:39.860 --> 07:42.029
ANNA BLEERS.
OH, MY GOD.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.064
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO MY SISTER?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.106
NEW YORK'S BEEN
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE

07:53.140 --> 07:54.174
SINCE THE DAY
WE GOT HERE.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.643
WHERE--
WHERE YOU FROM?

07:55.676 --> 07:56.944
DUNLOW, WEST VIRGINIA.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.912
WE CAME HERE
TO BE MODELS.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.014
BOY, WERE WE STUPID.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.751
(Stabler)
ONE MILLION DOLLARS,

08:03.784 --> 08:05.052
PAYABLE TO ME.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
NATALIE HAD ONE
JUST LIKE IT.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.189
WE WERE GONNA CASH THEM
WHEN WE MADE IT BIG.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.991
[sighs]

08:11.024 --> 08:12.626
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING

08:12.660 --> 08:14.061
HOW YOU GOT THAT?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.730
WE'D ONLY
BEEN HERE A WEEK

08:16.764 --> 08:19.099
AND SOME JERK IN AN SUV
RAN A RED LIGHT.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.100
[inhales sharply]

08:20.133 --> 08:22.202
SO NOW YOUR TWIN HAD
THE ONLY SHOT AT MAKING IT.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.804
THAT MUST HAVE
PISSED YOU OFF.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.539
I WOULD
NEVER HURT NATALIE.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.807
SHE STOOD BY ME.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.275
SHE MADE ME HER MANAGER.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.910
WE WERE A TEAM.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
SO WHY WOULD YOU LET HER

08:31.211 --> 08:32.613
HANG OUT
WITH PIMPS AND MOBSTERS?

08:32.646 --> 08:33.947
I TRIED TO STOP HER

08:33.981 --> 08:36.950
BUT NATALIE LIKED ATTENTION,
GOOD OR BAD.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.319
THAT'S WHY I HUNG UP
ON YOU WHEN YOU CALLED.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.921
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THIS JERK GOTS CALLING.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.990
WHO?

08:43.023 --> 08:45.125
GOTS MONEY,
THE HIP-HOP ARTIST.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.827
ARTIST?
TRY CHUMP.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.762
WHAT WAS SHE DOING
WITH THAT LOSER?

08:48.796 --> 08:50.197
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.132
ALL SHE'D SAY IS THAT
THERE WAS GONNA BE A BIG PAYDAY.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.801
FOR WHAT?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.135
I DON'T KNOW.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.037
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON.
SHE GOT SO SECRETIVE.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.105
SO THAT'S WHY SHE
HAD TWO PHONES?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.073
ONE FOR LEGIT CALLS
AND ONE FOR OTHER BUSINESS?

09:00.107 --> 09:03.176
I GUESS.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.012
I BEGGED NATALIE
NOT TO HANG OUT WITH HIM.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.079
HE SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.081
[sobs]
HE THREATEN HER?

09:08.115 --> 09:11.151
HE SAID...

09:11.184 --> 09:13.353
[inhales]

09:13.386 --> 09:15.823
IF SHE WASN'T
A NICE PUSSY,

09:15.856 --> 09:17.124
HE'D LET THE CAT
OUT OF THE BAG.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.092
[sniffs]

09:19.126 --> 09:21.161
PLEASE.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.231
MY SISTER WAS ALL I HAD.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.067
GOTS DID IT.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.070
I KNOW
HE KILLED MY SISTER.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.144
(Gots)
COUNT IT, BITCH!
MO' CHEDDA' THAN KRAFT.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.713
SKEET SKEET FROM THE NINE,
I CUT YA IN HALF--

09:39.747 --> 09:41.982
[headphones thud]

09:42.015 --> 09:43.684
HOLD UP, YOU JUST
WRECKED MY BEST TAKE!

09:43.717 --> 09:45.352
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE PLAYIN'
WITH MY MONEY, DAWG.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.755
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
PSYCHOS CUTTIN' UP WOMEN.

09:48.989 --> 09:49.890
HOLD UP,
I SING ABOUT THE LIFE.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.892
I DON'T--I DON'T LIVE
THAT LIFE NO MORE.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.662
OKAY, SO WHERE WASN'T YOU
LIVIN' IT LAST NIGHT?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.396
RIGHT HERE
IN THE STUDIO.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.265
MAKIN' THAT BANK.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.400
EVERYBODY KNOW--
WHAT DO GOTS GOT?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.636
GOTS MONEY!
GOTS MONEY!

10:02.670 --> 10:04.004
YO. YO!

10:04.037 --> 10:06.073

NATALIE BLEERS?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.374
YOU GOTS HER?

10:07.407 --> 10:10.043
I GOT A GIRL
FOR EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK.

10:10.077 --> 10:13.914
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE
MY FREAKY FRIDAY BITCH.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.182
(Fin)
LAST NIGHT WAS FRIDAY.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.050
SO THAT SUCKS FOR YOU.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.185
WHAT HAPPENED--
A NUT FROM YOUR NINE

10:18.218 --> 10:19.653
CAP HER IN THE HEAD?

10:19.687 --> 10:20.921
I AIN'T KILL NOBODY.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.989
AND I AIN'T GOT NO NINE.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.658
AND BESIDES THAT,
THAT GIRL DONE SEEN MORE NUTS

10:24.692 --> 10:25.659
THAN A CAN OF PLANTERS,

10:25.693 --> 10:28.696
SO I HAD TO KICK THAT
CRAZY BITCH TO THE CURB.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.864
IT WAS TOO MUCH DRAMA

10:30.898 --> 10:32.700
FOR A HIT IT AND QUIT IT
BROTHER SUCH AS MYSELF.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.801
[cell phone rings]
TOO MUCH DRAMA FOR YOU?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.235
STABLER.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.671
(Fin)
AND YOU'RE LIVING OUT
A MOVIE RIGHT HERE

10:37.705 --> 10:39.773
WITH ALL YOUR PACINO POSTERS
AND THIS BLING.

10:39.807 --> 10:42.342
'LEAST I GOT IT.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.177
AND I GOT SOMETHIN'
FOR YOU, TOO.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.413
ONE OF MY RINGTONES,

10:46.446 --> 10:48.682
HALF PRICE.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.183
STILL TOO MUCH MONEY.
PLAYA--

10:50.217 --> 10:52.352
(Stabler)
DON'T LEAVE TOWN.
IT'S WARNER.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.854
SHE'S GOT
SOMETHING FOR US.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.188
(Warner)
RESULTS CAME BACK

10:55.222 --> 10:57.157
ON THAT FOREIGN STRAIN
OF BACTERIA.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.992
SHE BIT BY A RAT
OR THE PERP?

10:59.026 --> 11:00.060
A TIGER.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.328
YOU'RE KIDDING.

11:01.361 --> 11:04.297
PASTEURELLA
MULTOCIDA TIGRIS--

11:04.331 --> 11:06.099
FOUND ONLY
IN A TIGER'S MOUTH.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.434
IF I HAD TO MAKE A GUESS,

11:07.467 --> 11:10.137
I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY
BENGAL OR SUMATRAN.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.705
EXPLAINS
THE SLASH MARKS.

11:11.739 --> 11:12.973
GOTS WASN'T KIDDING
WHEN HE THREATENED

11:13.006 --> 11:14.107
TO LET THE CAT
OUT OF THE BAG.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.776
ATTACKED BY A TIGER
IN THE CITY--

11:15.809 --> 11:17.044
THAT'S A FIRST.

11:17.077 --> 11:17.911
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.113
FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO,
A GUY WAS MAULED

11:20.147 --> 11:22.282
BY A LION HE WAS
KEEPING IN HIS APARTMENT.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.384
WHO COULD BE
THAT STUPID?

11:24.417 --> 11:26.419
GOTS MONEY
HAD SCARFACE MOVIE POSTERS

11:26.453 --> 11:27.955
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.389
THIS IS HIS CD COVER.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.958
NOW, WHAT IS
THE FIRST THING SCARFACE DID

11:30.991 --> 11:31.859
AFTER
HE STRUCK IT RICH?

11:31.892 --> 11:34.027
HE BOUGHT A TIGER.
AND GOTS IS A WANNABE.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.128
HE HAD
TO HAVE ONE, TOO.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.097
HE SET THAT TIGER
LOOSE ON NATALIE.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.465
AND ITS SALIVA
IS ALL OVER HER.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.933
WE NEED
A SEARCH WARRANT.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.201
SORRY, BUT NO JUDGE

11:41.234 --> 11:42.936
IS GONNA CONSIDER
BEING A MOVIE BUFF

11:42.970 --> 11:44.237
PROBABLE CAUSE.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.907
YOU READY FOR THE NEXT
ANIMAL ACT IN OUR CIRCUS?

11:46.940 --> 11:49.209
HOPE HE'S NOT
A CROCODILE DUNDEE FAN.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.080
CYANOPSITTA SPIXII,
ALSO KNOWN AS SPIX'S MACAW.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.447
EXTINCT IN THE WILD,

11:54.481 --> 11:56.216
ONLY 100 LEFT
IN CAPTIVITY,

11:56.249 --> 11:57.284
AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

11:57.317 --> 12:00.253
MATCHES THE BIRD FOUND
IN OUR VICTIM'S PURSE.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.789
WHAT WAS NATALIE
DOING WITH IT?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.456
SMUGGLING.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.958
LOOK AT THE EYES--

12:04.992 --> 12:07.027
PERFORATED
WITH TINY SLITS.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.195
WHY WOULD
A SMUGGLER DO THAT?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.997
SO IT WON'T SING
IN CHANGING LIGHT LEVELS

12:10.030 --> 12:11.331
AND GIVE AWAY
THE PERSON CARRYING IT.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.000
LOOKS LIKE GOTS
WAS USING NATALIE

12:13.033 --> 12:15.135
TO DO A LITTLE IMPORTING
FOR THEIR BIG PAYDAY.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.837
WELL,
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.039
ANIMALS ARE THE THIRD
MOST SMUGGLED COMMODITY

12:19.072 --> 12:20.440
IN THE WORLD
NEXT TO NARCOTICS AND GUNS.

12:20.473 --> 12:23.010
IT'S A $20 BILLION
A YEAR BUSINESS.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.311
MUST BE HOW HE'S
GETTING HIS MONEY,

12:24.344 --> 12:26.146
'CAUSE HE SURE AIN'T
MAKING IT WITH HIS MUSIC.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.481
BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE
OUTSIDE HIS FRONT DOOR,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.117
WE CAN'T MAKE A CASE.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.885
MAYBE A JUDGE
WILL ISSUE A WARRANT

12:31.919 --> 12:33.420
IF THERE'S
A PUBLIC HEALTH RISK.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
WEIRD GERMS LIVE
IN A TIGER'S MOUTH.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.424
WHO KNOWS WHAT LIVES
IN THE OTHER END?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.063
[knocking at door]

12:43.096 --> 12:45.132
YO, YO, YO, Y--

12:45.165 --> 12:46.333
WHAT'S GOTS GOT?

12:46.366 --> 12:48.001
GOTS TROUBLE.
WARRANT.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.104
WHERE'S THE TIGER?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.539
[door slams shut]

12:52.572 --> 12:54.341
THE TIGER.
OH!

12:54.374 --> 12:55.575
THE TIGER.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.210
IN THE BEDROOM.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.879
WHERE ELSE WOULD HE BE?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.513
WHAT'S UP, PIMPS?

13:00.547 --> 13:03.316
YOU KNOW HOW COLD
THESE NIGHTS CAN GET.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.118
[exhales loudly]
GOTTA KEEP HIM WARM.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.324
UH, NO, MUST HAVE
WENT FOR A WALK.

13:11.358 --> 13:12.826
REALLY?

13:17.597 --> 13:20.200
[growling]

13:20.233 --> 13:23.203
SON OF A BITCH.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.139
[growling]

13:28.175 --> 13:30.978
ROCCO'S MY PET.
HE NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.146
A TURTLE'S A PET.
A DAMN CAT, MAYBE.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.015
OKAY, HERE'S HOW
IT WENT DOWN--

13:35.048 --> 13:36.283
YOUR TIGER KILLED NATALIE.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.251
YOU PANICKED,
YOU SHOT HER IN THE HEAD

13:38.285 --> 13:39.319
TO MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE A HOLDUP,

13:39.352 --> 13:40.587
AND THEN
YOU DUMPED HER.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.055
MY TIGER?
MM-HMM.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.123
AIN'T NEVER
HURT NOBODY.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.192
OH, SO THERE'S ANOTHER TIGER
LOOSE IN THE CITY, HUH,

13:45.225 --> 13:46.459
AND IT MAULED
YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.428
MUST BE.
YOU'RE AN HONEST GUY.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.864
WHAT YOU DOIN'
WITH MY CD?

13:50.898 --> 13:52.199
I PICKED IT UP,
GAVE IT A LISTEN.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.401
YOU RAP ABOUT RUNNING
A DRUG RING OUT OF BROOKLYN.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.469
DAMN STRAIGHT.
WELL, IT'S FUNNY.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.338
I WORKED NARCOTICS
IN BROOKLYN FOR TEN YEARS,

13:58.371 --> 14:00.007
AND I NEVER HEARD
OF YOUR LYIN' ASS.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.612
OKAY.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.516
I'M JUST A BLACK GUY
FROM WESTCHESTER.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.084
I HAD TWO OPTIONS--

14:11.118 --> 14:14.087
GET AN OFFICE JOB
OR PLAY THE ROLE.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.422
I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,

14:15.455 --> 14:18.125
I ACT TOUGH,
CUT ME A ALBUM,

14:18.158 --> 14:19.259
MAYBE I CAN GET RICH.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.627
IN THE MEANTIME,
YOU SMUGGLE ANIMALS

14:20.660 --> 14:22.095
TO SUPPORT
YOUR BLING HABIT.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.097
(Fin)
NATALIE FIGURED OUT
YOUR SCHEME,

14:24.131 --> 14:25.899
WANTED A PIECE OF THE ACTION,
AND YOU DID HER.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.134
NAH, SHE WAS JUST
ANOTHER PRETTY GIRL

14:27.167 --> 14:28.401
THAT I WAS BANGIN'.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.003
NOT SO PRETTY NOW,
IS SHE?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.271
OH, MAN.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.572
COME ON.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.640
CAN'T FACE
YOUR HANDIWORK?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.211
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.913
ON THE REAL,

14:39.947 --> 14:41.514
SHE GOT ME THE TIGER.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.652
WELL,
THAT'S A NICE TRY.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.120
THAT'S HOW WE MET.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.188
I WAS ON EBAY
LOOKIN' FOR A TIGER.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.223
SHE SAID
SHE HAD THE HOOKUP.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.260
I WASN'T THE SMUGGLER.
SHE WAS.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.661
[knock at door]

14:54.694 --> 14:56.329
I NEED YOU TWO.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.599
HE WAS ABOUT
TO GIVE IT UP.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.935
UH, NO, HE WASN'T.
HE'S ON THE LEVEL.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.037
THE TIGER THAT
KILLED NATALIE, NOT HIS.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.039
COME ON.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.975
WARNER RAN THE DNA FROM
THE SALIVA FOUND ON THE VICTIM.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.042
DOESN'T MATCH GOTS'S CAT.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.978
DAMN, HOW MANY TIGERS
WE GOT ROAMIN' THIS CITY?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.245
WELL,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.113
WE CAN'T LET HIM
OFF THE HOOK

15:13.146 --> 15:15.382
UNTIL HE GIVES UP
THE OTHER SMUGGLERS.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.649
HOLD ON A SECOND.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.519
LET ME GET SOMETHING
OUT OF MY DESK.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.221
(Stabler)
WHO WAS NATALIE
WORKING WITH?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.123
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, PAL.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.391
WE GOT YOU

15:24.424 --> 15:26.126
AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND DEAD

15:26.159 --> 15:28.996
JURY CALLS THAT GUILTY.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.263
MONEY, YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY

15:59.559 --> 16:01.361

YOUR MESSAGES,

16:51.411 --> 16:52.645
SO YOU JUST BRING HIM

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
NO, NO, I--I PUSHED HIM.
I PUSHED HIM.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.283
I'M MIKE.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.318
[animals grunt,

16:58.351 --> 17:01.321
LOOK, THE DEAL IS, UH,
I'VE BEEN SMUGGLING ECSTASY

17:01.354 --> 17:02.789

AND I'M JUST, YOU KNOW--

17:04.557 --> 17:06.159
LOOKIN' TO MAKE

17:06.193 --> 17:08.495
YOUR NEXT MOVE...

17:08.528 --> 17:10.197

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
OKAY.

17:17.204 --> 17:20.240
MY BROTHER GOTS...

17:20.273 --> 17:21.274
WHAT A GUY.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.810
ALWAYS LOOKING OUT

17:23.843 --> 17:25.812
(Gots)
HEY, MAN, I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SHOW YOU SOME LOVE.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.247
YOU KNOW, THROW

17:27.280 --> 17:28.148
THAT'S IT.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.682
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.352
(Bushido)
AND I DON'T TRUST YOU.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.553
I DON'T TRUST

BEING A PUNCHING BAG,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.068
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE CAR.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.240
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND--
POSING AS A CUSTOMS AGENT

17:53.273 --> 17:54.707
WITHOUT CLEARING IT
WITH ME FIRST?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.176
I GOT SOME TIGER HAIR
THAT LINKS THESE SCUMBAGS

17:56.209 --> 17:57.244
TO NATALIE'S MURDER.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.878
HOW?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.314
DNA FROM THE TIGER IN
THIS GUY BUSHIDO'S WAREHOUSE--

18:01.348 --> 18:03.716
IT'S IDENTICAL
TO THE SALIVA

18:03.750 --> 18:05.152
THAT WE FOUND
OFF NATALIE.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.520
EL, IT'S KATHY.

18:07.554 --> 18:08.755
SHE'S BEEN CALLING YOUR LINE,
NOW SHE'S CALLING MINE.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.257
WANTS TO KNOW
WHEN YOU'LL BE BACK.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.259
[clears throat]
TELL HER I'M IN THE FIELD.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.195
[quietly]
OKAY. KATHY? HEY...

18:15.228 --> 18:17.230
NEXT TIME, YOU FOLLOW
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.200
THESE GUYS ALREADY
HAVE ONE BODY ON 'EM,

18:20.233 --> 18:22.535
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE?
(Kalke)
I DO.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.404
BRIANNA KALKE,
FISH AND WILDLIFE.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.738
WORD TRAVELS FAST.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.275
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
AGENT KALKE?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.510
GET DETECTIVE STABLER
TO BACK OFF BUSHIDO.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.612
MY AGENCY'S
BEEN WORKING BUSHIDO'S CREW

18:32.645 --> 18:33.880
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
A YOUNG WOMAN WAS
SADISTICALLY MURDERED--

18:35.548 --> 18:36.783
LOOK, I'M
ALREADY IN THERE.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.285
LIKE A BULL
IN A CHINA SHOP.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.752
HOW DID YOU
MAKE MY PARTNER?

18:39.786 --> 18:42.289
LET'S SAY A LITTLE
BIRDIE TOLD ME.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.624
THEN WE CAN'T HELP.
MURDER TRUMPS SMUGGLING.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.626
AND 14 MURDERS TRUMPS 1.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.296
THAT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE
BUSHIDO HAS KILLED.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.497
WELL, A YOUNG WOMAN'S
MURDER ON MY DESK

18:50.530 --> 18:52.165
MAKES IT PERSONAL TO ME.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.267
(Cragen)
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO CATCHES HIM

18:54.301 --> 18:55.702
AS LONG AS
HE GETS CAUGHT.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.271
WHAT CAN YOU GIVE US
ON BUSHIDO AND TYBOR?

19:02.475 --> 19:05.378
ANDRE BUSHIDO
IS RUSSIAN AND ITALIAN.

19:05.412 --> 19:06.846
HE USED TO TRAFFIC
IN YOUNG WOMEN

19:06.879 --> 19:09.616
BUT SWITCHED TO ANIMALS

19:09.649 --> 19:11.451
BECAUSE THE MONEY
IS JUST AS GOOD

19:11.484 --> 19:13.420
AND THE PENALTY FOR
GETTING CAUGHT--HALF AS BAD.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.823
VICTOR TYBOR IS
AN AMERICAN-BORN KENYAN,

19:16.856 --> 19:18.291
FORMER ENFORCER

19:18.325 --> 19:20.593
FOR THE ALBANIAN
CRIME SYNDICATE.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.296
BEFORE HE HOOKED UP
WITH BUSHIDO,

19:23.330 --> 19:24.597
HE WAS SMUGGLING
NUCLEAR CENTRIFUGE PARTS

19:24.631 --> 19:26.266
FROM BELARUS TO PAKISTAN.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.235
WHY'D THEY WHACK NATALIE?

19:28.268 --> 19:29.936
WE THINK SHE
MAY HAVE GOTTEN COCKY.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.638
TRIED TO MAKE A LITTLE
EXTRA ON THE SIDE,

19:31.671 --> 19:34.341
SO BUSHIDO
TOOK HER OUT.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.776
A CALL JUST CAME IN TO 911
FROM GOTS MONEY'S NEIGHBOR.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.578
SAID DOGS WERE FIGHTING
IN THE APARTMENT.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.647
GUY'S UNBELIEVABLE.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.282
ANIMAL CONTROL'S
ON THE WAY.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.716
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA JOIN 'EM.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.285
AND I'LL JOIN YOU.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.755
[animal chattering]

19:48.788 --> 19:50.790
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
AFRICAN HYENA.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.961
(man)
HERE'S THE LAST ONE.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.663
WE ALREADY TOOK
FOUR OUT OF HERE.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.997
ROOM'S A MESS.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.366
WE'RE BRINGING
ANOTHER TRUCK AROUND.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.933
DON'T GO NEAR THAT THING.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.270
[squealing]

20:04.971 --> 20:06.939
YOU'D THINK
SOMEBODY WENT OFF

20:06.973 --> 20:08.140
WITH A SHOTGUN IN HERE.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.244
(Kalke)
MY GUESS, BUSHIDO
DROPPED BY UNANNOUNCED.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.012
(Stabler)
HYENAS ARE
HIS CALLING CARD?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.046
AND HIS MURDER WEAPON.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.384
THEIR JAWS ARE STRONG ENOUGH
TO PULVERIZE BONE.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.287
THEY CAN EAT AND DIGEST
ALMOST ANYTHING,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.855
EXCEPT HAIR AND METAL.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.592
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT THING KILLED GOTS?

20:25.625 --> 20:27.294
CHECK OUT
THE HYENA VOMIT.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.598
HE HAVE A LOT OF BLING?

20:31.631 --> 20:35.268
[cell phone rings]
SO LONG, GOTS.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.603
IT'S BUSHIDO.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.541
HE WANTS ME
TO MEET HIM IN AN HOUR.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.981
(Stabler)
HEY.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.450
SORRY I'M LATE, MAN.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.851
TRAFFIC FROM THE AIRPORT
WAS A BITCH.

20:51.884 --> 20:52.919
THAT'S FUNNY.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.621
I JUST PICKED
LIANNA UP FROM JFK.

20:54.654 --> 20:55.722
ROADS WERE CLEAR.

20:55.755 --> 20:56.989
YOU MUST HAVE MISSED
THE 18-WHEELER

20:57.023 --> 20:58.891
THAT JACKKNIFED ON
THE VAN WYCK, MAN,

20:58.925 --> 21:00.527
'CAUSE IT WAS BAD.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.662

21:02.695 --> 21:03.730
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.499
SORRY ABOUT
THE LAST TIME.

21:06.533 --> 21:08.801
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
SHOWING UP UNEXPECTEDLY.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.036
HEY, YOU KNOW,
NEITHER DO I.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.504
YOU KNOW, UH,
GOTS SAID IT WAS COOL.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.706
NO WORRIES,
GOTS IS ALL GOOD NOW.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.808
PLEASE, SIT.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.312

21:22.014 --> 21:23.450
ENJOY.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.717
WE SAY...

21:24.751 --> 21:25.785
[speaking
in a foreign language]

21:28.355 --> 21:30.823
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

21:30.857 --> 21:32.359
RADIATED TURTLE EGGS.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.827
FLEW 'EM IN FRESH FROM
MADAGASCAR TONIGHT.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.429
EACH ONE IS
WORTH FIVE GRAND.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.698
LIANNA'S
OUR HUMAN INCUBATOR.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.467
IS THAT HOW YOU DO IT?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.801
YOU GET A PRETTY GIRL
TO GET ON A PLANE?

21:41.834 --> 21:43.636
YEAH.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.638
EVERYBODY WONDERING
HOW SHE LOOKS NAKED.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.039
(Bushido)
NOT IF SHE'S SMUGGLING
TURTLE EGGS.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.608
(Stabler)
IT MUST BE TOUGH

21:48.641 --> 21:50.543
FINDING BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
TO RISK GETTIN' CAUGHT.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.878
EVERYBODY
LOVES MONEY, MIKE.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.746
PROBLEM COMES
WHEN THEY GET STUPID.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.748
GIRL LIANNA REPLACED,

21:55.782 --> 21:58.751
SHE WAS IN HERE
THE OTHER DAY.

21:58.785 --> 21:59.919
SHE OPENED THE TIGER CAGE
OVER HERE,

21:59.952 --> 22:01.821
DECIDED SHE
WANTED TO PET HIM.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.356
TIGER TORE HER APART
IN TWO SECONDS.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.759
NEVER SEEN THAT MUCH
BLOOD BEFORE.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.596
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE TIGER?

22:09.629 --> 22:12.632
TASTY BUGGER, ISN'T HE?

22:16.703 --> 22:18.571
AH!

22:18.605 --> 22:20.840
NEVER ENJOYED
TIGER MEAT BEFORE.

22:20.873 --> 22:24.677
MIKE, YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE
WHAT GETS PEOPLE OFF.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.779
CRUSHED RHINO HORNS,
TIGER PENIS--YOU NAME IT.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.782
I ONCE SOLD A CASE

22:30.983 --> 22:32.419
[chuckles]

22:32.452 --> 22:34.554
YOU WANT IT,

22:36.055 --> 22:39.492
SO, WHAT DO YOU
NEED MY HELP DELIVERING?

22:41.628 --> 22:43.796
A WHITE CRESTED
HAINAN GIBBON.

22:43.830 --> 22:44.864
A MONKEY?

22:44.897 --> 22:46.666
THE RAREST MONKEY
IN THE WORLD.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.601
ONLY 17 LEFT.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.003
I'M BRINGING
IN A BABY FROM LAOS

22:51.037 --> 22:52.872
THAT WILL MAKE ME
$1 MILLION.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.841
WHY WOULD SOMEONE WANT
TO PAY A MILLION BUCKS

22:54.874 --> 22:55.908
FOR A PET?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.077
CHOPSTICKS.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.913
WE BUTCHER THE GIBBON,

23:00.947 --> 23:02.181

23:12.592 --> 23:13.826
BEFORE THEY

23:13.860 --> 23:15.562
TOO RISKY.

23:15.595 --> 23:16.829
(Tybor)
WE NEED TO GET OUR GUY

23:16.863 --> 23:18.865
OFF THE PLANE
AND RIGHT THROUGH CUSTOMS.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.633
HEY, NO--CUSTOMS.
NO PROBLEM.

23:20.667 --> 23:21.901
YOU KNOW, YOU GIVE ME

IF YOU WANT.

23:24.604 --> 23:25.872
ONE STEP AT A TIME, MIKE.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.675
SMUGGLING LIVE ANIMALS
IS A LOT TOUGHER

23:28.708 --> 23:29.909
THAN BRINGING IN DRUGS.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.911
ANY MULE CAN SWALLOW
A CONDOM OF SMACK

23:31.944 --> 23:33.446
AND CRAP IT OUT.

23:33.480 --> 23:34.747
CAN'T SWALLOW
A FRIGGIN' MONKEY.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.182
[chuckles]

23:37.484 --> 23:38.818
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

23:38.851 --> 23:39.886
YOU CAN START

23:39.919 --> 23:42.755
BY HANDING OVER YOUR WALLET
AND YOUR CELL PHONE.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.056
SLOWLY.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.903
DRIVER'S LICENSE
SAYS YOU LIVE IN QUEENS.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.538

DADDY'S FINALLY HOME.

24:27.600 --> 24:28.968
[clears throat]

24:48.154 --> 24:50.757
WHERE'S ELLIOT?

24:50.790 --> 24:53.793
HE'S NOT WITH ME, KATHY.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.828
[quietly]
OH, GOD.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.097

24:58.130 --> 25:00.567
LET'S TAKE IT EASY.

25:00.600 --> 25:01.834

25:01.868 --> 25:04.637
[door closes]
SERIOUSLY.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.105
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.574
THAT STUFF WAS CLEAN, MAN.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.609
HEY, GUYS,
WHY DON'T WE RELAX, HUH?

25:09.642 --> 25:11.210
WE'LL HAVE SOME BEERS.
THE GAME'S ON IN TEN MINUTES.

25:11.243 --> 25:12.945
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HUH?

25:12.979 --> 25:14.847
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.949

25:16.983 --> 25:18.017
OKAY, OKAY.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.819
[speaking in
a foreign language]

25:19.852 --> 25:22.321
HOW STUPID IS
YOUR GOVERNMENT?

25:22.354 --> 25:25.057
THEY TRUST PEOPLE
LIKE YOU TO WORK CUSTOMS,

25:25.091 --> 25:27.259
BUT THEY PAY YOU LIKE
YOU'RE CLEANING TOILETS.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.897
SO YOU'LL PAY ME BETTER.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.700
FIRST, WE CHECK YOU OUT.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.968
THEN WE TALK MONEY.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.805
BUDDY.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.675
(Benson)
HE'S OKAY.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.678

32:04.023 --> 32:05.557

32:07.026 --> 32:09.061
I EXTRACTED THE OTHER

RUNNING BY HIS HOUSE,

32:38.324 --> 32:41.327
PROBABLY A ROBBERY.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.530
SO WHAT HAPPENS
WITH BUSHIDO AND TYBOR?

32:44.563 --> 32:46.732
WE'RE ABOUT

33:13.259 --> 33:15.561
COUPLE HUNDRED POUNDS

33:15.594 --> 33:17.629

IF I WAS A THINKER,

33:42.588 --> 33:44.456
I WOULDN'T BE SELLING
ANIMAL FOOD FOR A LIVING.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.658
HOW DID THEY

33:46.692 --> 33:48.327

33:50.796 --> 33:53.132

I SWEAR IT'S TRUE.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.629
I'VE BEEN WORKING
UNDERCOVER FOR A YEAR.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.897
PROVE IT.

[breathing heavily]

37:38.790 --> 37:40.759
LOOK.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.763
I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN

37:44.796 --> 37:46.765
IT'S OVER.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.700
NOT FOR ME.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.836
MY REAL TARGET'S
A PRISON GANG

37:50.869 --> 37:52.304
THAT'S RUNNING
THE SMUGGLING RING.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.772
BUSHIDO'S JUST
ONE RUNG ON THE LADDER.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.842

HE'S A COP.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.935
DIRTY?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.838
UNDERCOVER.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.944
WANT ME

38:34.613 --> 38:36.815
FAMILY'S GONE.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.850
LOST THEM A LONG TIME AGO.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.086
THIS LIFE
PROVED TOO MUCH FOR 'EM.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.871
[baby crying]

39:11.116 --> 39:13.619
[sighs]

39:13.652 --> 39:16.388
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
