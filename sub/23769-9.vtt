00:29.200 --> 00:30.720
Hello, Mr. Cruz.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.360
[theme music playing]

01:02.120 --> 01:04.319
Wow. Something smells good over there.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.320
Let me guess, beef bourguignon?

01:07.400 --> 01:10.960
You mean the five-hour famous
Osmond beef bourguignon.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.960
Specially requested by Ms. Hayward here.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.000
Oh! Well, I feel bad for forcing you
to work so hard for us.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.720
Well, you're a hard woman to say no to.

01:21.560 --> 01:24.440
[chuckles] That's... true.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.840
[chuckles] Well,
I'll take it as a compliment.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.720
Ã€ table.
Jason, will you bring in the meat?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.240
Louis, will you take a look at these two?

01:37.760 --> 01:40.120
-What a beautiful couple.
-[chuckles softly]

01:41.760 --> 01:44.960
Well, Judy, we were meant to be.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.240
Aw. That is music to my ears.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.360
Mmm.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.400
Make sure to say the "we were meant to be"
line in front of Judy.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.640
Good point.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.280
[sighs] God, it's so weird.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.840
So, how exactly are you gonna get
Emma's chess set from Jason?

02:01.920 --> 02:04.480
While you're at dinner,
I'll call Jason and tell him

02:04.560 --> 02:06.720
I think I've found Emma's chess set
in the Ravens clubhouse.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.000
Make him think
maybe he took the wrong one.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.840
[cell phone ringing]

02:14.160 --> 02:15.120
Yeah?

02:16.920 --> 02:18.400
You found what?

02:20.160 --> 02:21.760
Jason, is everything all right?

02:21.840 --> 02:24.080
[Jackie]  Once Max calls him,
Jason will have to leave dinner

02:24.160 --> 02:27.520
and go to his office to see if maybe
someone had taken Emma's chess set.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.480
Uh, sorry. Admin stuff.

02:30.560 --> 02:36.200
Uh, I seem to have forgotten
to send this email to the, uh, CDE.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.680
The California Department of Education
is calling you now?

02:39.480 --> 02:42.120
Sorry, it'll just take a minute.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.280
That's part one. Part two,

02:46.360 --> 02:49.640
once Jason leaves, Brooke has to
find a reason to leave the dinner too.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.000
-[shrieks]
-[Judy] Oh! Oh.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.480
-[Daniel] I'm sorry, babe.
-I'm gonna go clean this.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.080
I'll be right back.

02:56.160 --> 02:58.720
[Hayley]  Now, all you have to do
is follow your brother

02:58.800 --> 03:00.280
and you'll find the chess set.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.880
What are you doing here?

03:03.960 --> 03:07.160
Um, looking for the stain remover.
I thought I saw it in here the other day.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.680
Oh, I'm sorry, Jason. I'm sorry.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.200
[Jackie]  Then we arrive at part three.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.480
[Max] These are two exact replicas

03:16.560 --> 03:18.080
of the white knights
in Emma's chess board.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.080
You need to replace
Emma's pieces with these.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.360
What do you guys say? Great plan or what?

03:23.440 --> 03:25.920
I don't know. Jason will be onto us.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.840
No, he won't. I got this.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.840
-It's fine. It's fine.
-No, no, I wanna help.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.320
[Louie chimes]

03:51.400 --> 03:53.440
-What was that?
-A text from a student.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.040
Some of these kids have no boundaries.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.800
Boundaries are something
you'll learn to control

03:57.880 --> 04:00.480
as you gain more experience as dean here.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
All right.

04:24.080 --> 04:27.160
Okay. You'll do what I asked?

04:28.280 --> 04:29.280
I will.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.920
You can leave now.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.800
You're free to go.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.720
-Great job, by the way.
-Happy we didn't get caught.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.480
-What happened to you?
-I forgot to brush my teeth.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.360
So why are you dressed
like you were outside?

05:04.440 --> 05:07.440
I guess I got tired
and fell asleep in my clothes.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.280
Okay.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.360
[chuckles softly]

05:57.920 --> 05:59.240
[chuckles]

06:28.720 --> 06:31.960
I traced the latest outgoing calls
to Geller's old number.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.120
-And?
-I don't have an exact location,

06:35.200 --> 06:37.320
but they're definitely coming
from inside the Greenhouse.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.080
-You tapped her new phone, right?
-Of course.

06:39.160 --> 06:43.040
Good. We don't want anyone from
the Greenhouse contacting this Emma girl.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.360
What's this about the Greenhouse?

06:46.080 --> 06:49.560
What? Oh, it's just that,
uh, Taser investigation.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.880
-Just tying up some loose ends.
-Paperwork, you know.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.800
Yeah, I read your report.
There was no connection to the Greenhouse.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.000
Exactly.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.000
Well, I gotta go.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.480
I didn't know Perry got a raise.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.160
What are you talking about?

07:09.240 --> 07:12.800
Did you see his watch?
That's at least a ten-grand Rolex.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.400
[chuckles] Yeah, you know Perry.
He's always trying to show off.

07:16.480 --> 07:18.640
-It's probably a fake. Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:18.720 --> 07:19.800
[chuckles]

07:23.720 --> 07:26.160
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Aspen was watching me,

07:26.240 --> 07:28.560
so I had to make sure
I wasn't being followed.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.320
-Hey, bro!
-Hey, sis.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
Okay, show us what you got.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.080
At first, I didn't find anything.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.840
I removed the felt
from underneath the knight, nothing.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.520
I scanned it and then
I used a Geiger counter

07:37.600 --> 07:39.400
-to check for isotopes, 'cause you can--
-Okay, okay.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.360
It took you a long time to get the clue.
Can you show us?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.760
Oh, sorry.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.200
So, then I checked the other knight,

07:45.280 --> 07:48.200
and I found an encrypted microchip
with a video on it.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.920
Emma made a movie the night
she left the Greenhouse.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.400
[Jackie] Max, show us the video.

07:51.480 --> 07:54.240
Oh. Yes. Okay.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.840
Max, I lied to you
and I'm so sorry for that.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.920
I don't have much time,
but I have to tell you everything I know,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.760
even though
it's only these bits and pieces.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.080
Anyway, on the day
of the satellite launch,

08:06.160 --> 08:08.880
the reason I was late
to your picnic was because

08:08.960 --> 08:11.400
I was busy hacking into the NASA servers.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.840
I helped bring down the satellite,
and I did this all from your laptop.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.920
What?

08:19.080 --> 08:23.200
My laptop can access encrypted sites
that normal laptops can't.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.040
-I showed it off to Emma to impress her.
-Bad idea.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.640
It was Jason Osmond
who told me to do all this.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.200
He told me he was working with
the government on a classified project,

08:33.280 --> 08:34.679
but I know he's lying.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.559
He never told me
they were gonna shut down the satellite.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.200
And when I found out, I confronted him

08:39.280 --> 08:41.159
and he threatened to kick me out
of the Greenhouse.

08:41.240 --> 08:43.799
[sighs]  I knew this
would break my parents' heart.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.040
So, today, when I tried to call NASA
and tell them everything,

08:47.120 --> 08:48.560
Jason said he would turn me in.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.400
[sighs]  It was his word against mine.

08:51.480 --> 08:55.000
[sniffles]  Oh, my God.
I'm so ashamed, Max.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.320
I couldn't risk my parents finding out,
so I agreed to leave.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.120
[Jason]  Emma? Are you ready?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.720
I don't know who he's working for,
but I know he's not alone.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.280
Please be careful, Max. Trust no one.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.480
[Jason]  Emma!

09:13.360 --> 09:15.040
How could you be that stupid?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.840
The watch?

09:19.640 --> 09:21.280
What's your problem?

09:44.600 --> 09:47.600
Okay, you guys realize
this is now criminal.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.160
We have to go to the police.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.560
-With what?
-With this!

09:51.640 --> 09:53.800
All we have is Emma's confession.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.880
The first thing they'll do is arrest her,

09:55.960 --> 09:59.040
and you, once they find out
that she used your laptop.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.920
It's Emma's word against Jason's.
Like she said.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.080
-Why would my brother do this?
-'Cause he's working with my mom.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.720
I saw the way she looked at him
when Max called.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.320
I just know they're in this together.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.560
If we only knew what "this" was.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.320
Well, whatever it is, Alex,
it has to do with Mom.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.520
I mean, that satellite
was part of her research.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.400
What was your mom's research about?

10:23.400 --> 10:27.240
She never really told us.
It was very top secret.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.360
And we never asked.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.080
She had a PhD in geophysics at Caltech
with highest honors,  summa cum laude.

10:34.160 --> 10:39.000
-Where'd you get this?
-Uh,  LA Times.  It's her obituary.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.760
I've never seen that.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.320
What's CSL?

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
CSL?

10:46.960 --> 10:52.640
Uh, Caltech Seismological Laboratory.
A lot of geophysicists study seismology.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.200
Seismology is the study
of earthquakes, right?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.640
So your mother researched earthquakes?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.080
You think this had something
to do with that satellite?

11:00.160 --> 11:03.440
I remember overhearing Marcus
talking about an earthquake in the cave.

11:03.520 --> 11:06.320
But we obviously felt
the same earthquake that they did.

11:06.400 --> 11:10.320
No. Wait. You returned a day before
the actual earthquake happened.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.560
You guys know what this means?

11:13.640 --> 11:16.240
They somehow knew
the earthquake was coming.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.160
Um, could I get a small
double chocolate ice cream, please?

11:22.240 --> 11:24.000
-[man] Sure.
-Thanks.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.200
If you're wondering where she is,
I can tell you.

11:37.680 --> 11:39.600
She's with Daniel.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.280
They're in the old biology lab.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.720
I think I saw her brother there too.
And Jackie. And Max.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.480
Are you really that bored, Aspen?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.640
I'm only trying to help you, Leo.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.760
You're our captain
and they're conspiring behind your back.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.600
-I'll get that. Thank you.
-[scoffs]

12:00.560 --> 12:02.960
[Eric] This is an awkward
situation for me, Chief.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.080
When you gave Carter his job back,

12:05.160 --> 12:07.320
you asked me if I thought he was ready
and I said yes.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.360
So?

12:09.440 --> 12:12.080
Now I'm not so sure,
to tell you the truth.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.000
His paranoia is starting to surface again
and I'm worried.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.920
Why? Is he bringing up
conspiracy theories about Ryan again?

12:19.000 --> 12:22.120
Oh, I wish. Now he's convinced
that Perry's been taking bribes.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.960
-Our Perry?
-Yeah. And he won't leave it alone.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.960
-He won't listen to me.
-Uh-huh.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.320
I mean, he's my best friend,
you know that.

12:28.400 --> 12:29.720
It's just that...

12:30.680 --> 12:35.320
I'm worried for his safety,
to be honest with you. And ours.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.840
Maybe I was too quick in letting him
come back to work,

12:38.440 --> 12:40.560
but I was sure he'd, uh, recovered.

12:40.640 --> 12:41.800
Mmm-hmm.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.800
Okay. Let's just keep
an eye on him, all right?

12:44.880 --> 12:46.000
Sure, Chief.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.160
-Good.
-Yeah.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.120
Who are you calling?

12:52.200 --> 12:54.600
Brandon Thomas.
We have to tell him about the satellite.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.920
Hold on. We should tell my dad first.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.520
-Remember what Emma said.
-"Trust no one."

12:59.600 --> 13:02.280
You don't think my dad
is working with them?

13:02.360 --> 13:08.960
I don't. But I also didn't think that
about Marcus. Or Judy. Or Jason.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.680
Or Eric.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.320
Of course! How could we miss that?

13:15.400 --> 13:17.600
He said he took you to the station.
Did he really?

13:17.680 --> 13:20.760
[Brooke] I'm starting to remember. Um...

13:21.640 --> 13:25.080
It was Eric who took me to the cave,
to Marcus. I'm sure.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.720
He's the one who turned you in.

13:28.720 --> 13:29.800
This is too much.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.000
Oh, I hated that guy ever since
he forced me to take that polygraph test.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.760
I knew there was something
sketchy about him.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.120
Let me get this straight.

13:37.160 --> 13:41.000
Your mom. Marcus and your brother.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.600
And our dad's best friend.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.680
I'm calling Dad.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.480
[cell phone vibrating]

14:10.640 --> 14:11.920
[computer beeps]

14:21.840 --> 14:23.200
[Eric] Can I help you?

14:24.160 --> 14:26.080
Why are you breaking into my computer?

14:28.800 --> 14:31.400
What were you and Perry
talking about this morning?

14:31.480 --> 14:33.560
Carter, stop it. I'm your friend.

14:33.640 --> 14:37.160
Are you? If you're really my friend,
you'll let me log onto your computer.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.480
-That's not gonna happen.
-What are you hiding, Eric?

14:39.560 --> 14:41.960
-You should get some rest.
-Get off me!

14:42.040 --> 14:43.160
I was wrong about you.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.080
-You're not ready to be back.
-No, I was wrong about you!

14:45.160 --> 14:48.720
Hey, guys, stop.
You mind telling me what's going on here?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.120
Ask Carter. He was trying
to break into my computer.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.000
Can't you see what's going on here?

14:53.080 --> 14:55.840
Eric and Perry are hiding
some kind of evidence.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.640
I heard them
talking about it this morning.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.160
-Something about, uh, tapping phone calls.
-I told you he was getting worse.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.320
You have to believe me!

15:04.400 --> 15:07.320
Internal Affairs needs to know
what's going on here!

15:07.400 --> 15:10.800
Carter... I think you should
take the rest of the day off.

15:10.880 --> 15:11.880
[sighs]

15:24.400 --> 15:25.480
Do you know what this is?

15:26.200 --> 15:29.720
My wife wrote me this letter
the night before she died.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.080
Now, maybe she wrote something about you.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.960
-You stole the letter!
-I have no idea what he's--

15:42.040 --> 15:44.640
-You lying piece of--
-Get off of me!

15:44.720 --> 15:46.960
Okay, Woods, that's it! You're dismissed.

15:47.040 --> 15:50.840
Now, you make sure you leave your gun
and your badge at the personnel office.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.960
Now, get.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.760
Eric, in my office, now.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.480
He's not answering me either.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.960
Do you think we're too late?
Do you think he got to Dad?

16:08.640 --> 16:11.640
We're not crazy, right?
We're not just imagining this.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.880
We know something terrible is going on.
We just don't have anyone to turn to.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.360
That's it. I'm going there.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.440
Where are you going?

16:19.520 --> 16:21.400
To that cave, or whatever it is.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.120
I'll stand there until they let me in
and I'll tell my mom I know all about her.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.440
And then what? You'll look her
in the eye and she'll repent

16:26.520 --> 16:28.040
and do volunteer work at a soup kitchen?

16:28.120 --> 16:29.560
Do you have a better idea, Hayley?

16:29.640 --> 16:33.080
Emma was right, that's for sure.
We can't trust anyone.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.160
[Louie chimes]

16:36.640 --> 16:37.680
Is it Dad?

16:39.160 --> 16:41.960
-No, it's Leo.
-What does he want?

16:42.640 --> 16:44.520
He wants to talk. Alone.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.480
-I'm going.
-I'll go with you.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.320
-No, it's okay.
-Well, what if it's a trap?

17:00.400 --> 17:03.200
-You think Leo's working with them?
-How do we know he's not?

17:06.359 --> 17:09.520
I'm going. Stay here, I'll be quick.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.160
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.680
I'm listening.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
Hello, Mr. Cruz.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.680
Are you gonna hypnotize me?

17:52.160 --> 17:54.680
I will never do that again in my life.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.840
Then what are you gonna do?

17:57.920 --> 18:01.840
I'm gonna show you something that I think
would be of interest to you.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.680
Come with me.

18:17.920 --> 18:22.000
-It's Ryan.
-Yes. It's her.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.440
[Leo] How is she alive?

18:25.360 --> 18:26.840
[Marcus] I saved her.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.040
But how? It's impossible.
We all saw the explosion.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
-Um...
-[machines beeping]

18:33.080 --> 18:36.240
Ryan used the escape pod
seconds before the explosion.

18:37.840 --> 18:39.920
I waited for her at sea, and um,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.600
retrieved her before
the authorities arrived.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.520
Nobody found the body.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.280
But is she okay? Why is she unconscious?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.360
It's the only way I can keep her alive.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.240
Her vital signs are fine.
She's asleep for now.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.840
-Why didn't you tell anyone about her?
-No one can know Ryan is alive.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.960
If the people I'm working for found out,
that'd be the end of her.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.920
You understand
what I'm saying to you, Leo?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.320
Why are you working
for these people, Marcus?

19:11.120 --> 19:14.240
Greed, at first.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.240
I wanted to support my family.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.240
And now I'm in too deep
and I have to take care of her.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.160
Once we're done with our mission,
I can wake her up.

19:26.800 --> 19:27.840
What mission?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.240
Telling you this would be unfair to you.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.200
So why did you tell me about Hayley's mom?

19:32.280 --> 19:37.480
Look, Leo, you're a bunch of smart kids.
I've been keeping tabs on everyone.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.200
I know you're close to discovering
what we're doing here

19:40.280 --> 19:42.080
and that you'll try to stop us.

19:42.920 --> 19:48.760
Now, you're a born leader
and you're very close to Hayley.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.960
I'm sure you'd like her
to see her mother alive again.

19:52.040 --> 19:56.760
If you want that to happen,
you have to let us accomplish our mission.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.840
I risked everything to save Ryan.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.800
Now you must help me to see it through.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.040
It'll all be over in a few hours.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.200
She's alive, Hayley. Your mother is alive.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.160
I saw her with my own eyes.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.560
We just need to let them
finish the mission

20:25.640 --> 20:27.920
and then you'll be able to see her again.
