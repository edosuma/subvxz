WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:04.404
Tonight, Silicon Valley veteran
Nirav Tolia joins the Tank.

00:04.404 --> 00:07.841
Nirav is the founder of social
media phenomenon Nextdoor.

00:07.841 --> 00:11.745
I have spent the last decade
of my life building a company.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.714
I feel like
you're a kindred spirit.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.483
We're here today because
we have a shipping issue.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.318
I don't do failure, okay?

00:18.318 --> 00:19.319
We don't, either.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.320
What are
your total sales?

00:20.320 --> 00:22.322
$4.1 million.
Ooh.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.958
Wow.
You know how to sell.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.027
I think what you've done
is genius.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.396
There is
no other person to scale

00:29.396 --> 00:30.964
a business like this than me.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.966
Whoa.
You had a problem
reading the room.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.369
You're probably one of the most
impressive entrepreneurs

00:35.369 --> 00:36.670
that's stood
on that carpet.

00:36.670 --> 00:37.771
I just want to back you.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.706
I got to turn you
into freakin' stars.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.508
You want to try to control
your own destiny.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.511
We have worked so hard
to build this company.

00:44.511 --> 00:45.679
Cry me a river.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.782
I believe in you guys.
Go big or go home.

00:57.190 --> 01:01.194
First in the Tank
is an easier way to eat seafood.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.372
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Emily.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.440
And I'm Melissa,

01:13.440 --> 01:15.342
and we're two moms
from Houston, Texas,

01:15.342 --> 01:17.978
that are making waves
in the seafood industry.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.581
We're here today asking
for $200,000

01:20.581 --> 01:25.052
in exchange for 15%
of our company, Fish Fixe.

01:25.052 --> 01:26.386
So let's talk seafood.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.989
It's great for your brain,
your heart, and your skin,

01:28.989 --> 01:31.191
but did you know that
only 2 in 10 Americans

01:31.191 --> 01:32.960
are meeting
the dietary recommendation

01:32.960 --> 01:34.161
for seafood consumption?

01:34.161 --> 01:36.663
That means that
80% of Americans

01:36.663 --> 01:39.800
are not reeling in
the benefits of seafood.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.134
Why is that?

01:41.134 --> 01:43.136
It's because they're
not confident buying it,

01:43.136 --> 01:45.172
handling it,
or cooking it.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.007
And that's where
Fish Fixe comes in.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.043
Fish Fixe delivers perfectly
portioned, premium seafood

01:50.043 --> 01:51.845
to doorsteps
nationwide,

01:51.845 --> 01:54.047
making seafood both
simple and approachable.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.650
We've sourced
the absolute best seafood

01:56.650 --> 01:57.851
from around the globe,

01:57.851 --> 02:00.187
individually portion it
so it's easy to work with,

02:00.187 --> 02:01.588
and then freeze in
the freshness

02:01.588 --> 02:02.990
so the quality
is consistent.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.458
But we don't
stop there.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.995
The after‐delivery experience
is what really sets us apart.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.896
All of our packaging
is geared towards

02:09.896 --> 02:11.765
your success
in the kitchen.

02:11.765 --> 02:12.799
Like these bags.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.635
They come with
thaw, prep,

02:14.635 --> 02:17.037
and simple
cooking instructions.

02:17.037 --> 02:20.040
Oh, and that's not it.
They're also odor‐absorbent.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.742
So once you're done
prepping your fish,

02:21.742 --> 02:23.176
simply take
the prep trash,

02:23.176 --> 02:24.845
put it back in the bag,
and toss.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.147
No fishy smell
left behind.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.884
Sharks, this is quite
the oppor‐"tuna"‐ty.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.053
So which one of you is
ready to take the bait

02:33.053 --> 02:35.555
and get America
their Fish Fixe?

02:35.555 --> 02:36.590
Good job.
Can we eat it?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.691
‐Yes! Please!
‐Yes, please do!

02:37.691 --> 02:39.126
Alright.
Good job, guys.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.861
So, yeah, you'll see,

02:40.861 --> 02:42.596
that's our wild‐caught
Gulf shrimp

02:42.596 --> 02:44.598
with a spicy
cocktail sauce,

02:44.598 --> 02:45.999
'cause I am
from south Louisiana

02:45.999 --> 02:47.334
and I can't help myself
with that.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.503
Ooh, it's a good sauce.
Thank you.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.272
Next is our Maryland‐style
crab cake with remoulade.

02:52.272 --> 02:54.307
Oh, this sauce.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.842
Thank you.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.179
After that, we have
our blackened salmon.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.381
And then finally,
we have our American red snapper

03:01.381 --> 03:04.351
and a Kevin O'Leary
white wine sauce.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.486
Mmm!
Oh, no!

03:06.486 --> 03:08.455
So if you don't like that one,
that is on Kevin.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.990
Very good sucking up.
Very good.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.058
Thank you.
Thank you.
Very good.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.392
How did you guys
start this?

03:12.392 --> 03:14.461
Like, are you chefs?
Are you...?

03:14.461 --> 03:18.365
No, I've been in the seafood
business my entire career.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.033
Actually, my husband and I
started

03:20.033 --> 03:22.469
a live lobster wholesale
distribution facility

03:22.469 --> 03:23.704
in Houston, Texas...
Wow.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.639
...and started serving
restaurants and retail.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.208
Tell us,
how did that morph into this?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.811
Yeah, so we met
on a soccer field.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.946
We played soccer
in college together,

03:32.946 --> 03:35.215
and after college,
I accepted a job

03:35.215 --> 03:37.751
working for one of the largest
wine and spirits wholesalers,

03:37.751 --> 03:39.619
distributors in the U. S.

03:39.619 --> 03:43.023
So what's harder to sell ‐‐
the spirits or the fish?

03:43.023 --> 03:44.057
You know what?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.325
I would say
it's just all about

03:45.325 --> 03:46.927
the storytelling
and connecting.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.462
Great answer.
Great answer.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.830
Are you exclusively
subscription...
We are not.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.231
...or can I buy anything
on your website?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066
You can buy anything
on our website,

03:53.066 --> 03:56.336
and our subscriptions are just
really set up for convenience.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.738
You can pause,
cancel anytime.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.073
What does it cost,
and what is your cost?
Yeah.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.274
Walk me through it.

04:01.274 --> 04:02.943
Yeah, so we're
100% direct‐to‐consumer

04:02.943 --> 04:04.244
through our website.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.047
The most popular box
is 16 portions,

04:07.047 --> 04:10.717
and you can purchase that
for $139 or $149.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.519
What are
your total sales?

04:12.519 --> 04:14.988
So last year, we did
$821,000 in sales.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.057
Wow. Good.
Oh, my gosh.
Congratulations.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.525
And did you make
money off of that?

04:18.525 --> 04:19.826
We made $20,000.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.561
Do you think
you're breaking even

04:21.561 --> 04:23.497
because your customer
acquisition costs are high?

04:23.497 --> 04:24.731
What does it cost you
to acquire a customer?

04:24.731 --> 04:28.268
Our customer acquisition cost
is between $30 and $40.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.605
And this year?
What will you do this year?
And where are you looking
what you're gonna do this year?

04:31.605 --> 04:34.107
So we're at
$494,000, year to date,

04:34.107 --> 04:36.343
and we do believe that
we're gonna break a million

04:36.343 --> 04:37.911
and hoping to land
right around $1.2 million.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.680
And just so we understand,
just from the very top,

04:40.680 --> 04:42.983
how much does it cost you
to manufacture that?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.684
How much does it cost
to deliver that?

04:44.684 --> 04:46.219
So what's
the total landed cost?

04:46.219 --> 04:47.454
Just so we can understand
the margins.

04:47.454 --> 04:51.091
Yeah, so our average order value
is $143.

04:51.091 --> 04:56.096
From there, our delivered cost
is about $111 right now,

04:56.096 --> 04:57.264
which we can't wait
to talk about,

04:57.264 --> 04:59.499
'cause there's
a reason behind that.

04:59.499 --> 05:00.500
But yeah, that's where
we are right now.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.735
What is the reason
behind it?

05:01.735 --> 05:04.504
We're here today because
we have a shipping issue.

05:04.504 --> 05:08.475
We subsidize all of our packages
to East and West Coast,

05:08.475 --> 05:10.877
because what happened was,
when the world shut down,

05:10.877 --> 05:13.346
people in densely populated
areas, the East and West Coast,

05:13.346 --> 05:14.881
they needed product,

05:14.881 --> 05:20.754
and our customer mix grew
from 75% local, one‐day ships

05:20.754 --> 05:24.257
to 50%
East and West Coast.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.326
It's all shipping.
It's shipping.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.930
So the shipping is actually
11% of our revenue.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.965
Wow.
Yeah, it's high.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.366
And we do believe we're
gonna get that down

05:33.366 --> 05:34.367
to around 5%.
So what's the plan?
What's the plan?

05:34.367 --> 05:35.669
We have a plan.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.471
- So we have a 3
- PL that can
strategically get us

05:38.471 --> 05:42.776
to every single zone
in one to two days,

05:42.776 --> 05:44.244
which fits perfectly
in our model.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.613
But, guys, you have
a fundamental problem, right?
Yes.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.149
Your primary costs
are all variable.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.684
You know, seafood,
right?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.019
That protein,
there's variance in the cost,

05:53.019 --> 05:54.988
and then the shipping,
you know,

05:54.988 --> 05:56.323
I think your prices
will come down,

05:56.323 --> 05:57.991
but they're always
variable as well...
Yeah.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.359
...even in normal times.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.228
That makes
the business very tough.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.231
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.700
Let me ask what I think
is the most important question,

06:06.700 --> 06:08.735
which is, of your
existing customers,

06:08.735 --> 06:11.771
how many are continuing
to order two times,

06:11.771 --> 06:13.807
three times, four times,
five‐plus times?

06:13.807 --> 06:16.977
55% of our customers to date
have returned.
Wow.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.547
70% of our total revenue

06:20.547 --> 06:22.415
is from our subscription
business.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.952
I love fish. I'm a Shark.
I'm a very big fish.

06:25.952 --> 06:29.890
But over 13 years, I've become
a mini‐expert on lots of things,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.791
but not
shipping and logistics.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.360
Yeah.
I can't help you.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.362
There might be a bigger fish
here that can.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.931
I'm out.
Thank you.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.300
This fits into my
Chef Wonderful world.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.268
Yes.
Okay?

06:41.268 --> 06:44.170
And that's a very
successful model.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.673
And the only reason
it's successful is

06:46.673 --> 06:49.175
our customer acquisition costs
are very competitive.

06:49.175 --> 06:51.912
I would get behind this
as a third partner.

06:51.912 --> 06:55.615
I want 33.3% for $200,000,

06:55.615 --> 06:58.485
and I go to work with you
on the social side.
Yeah.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.954
I got to turn you
into a freakin' stars.
And we are.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.089
We're two Division I
collegiate athletes.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.357
Like, we got this.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.861
I think your primary
industry is moving fish

07:07.861 --> 07:09.195
and I think
you can do that,

07:09.195 --> 07:11.598
but you need to have a partner
who understands that.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.833
And so for that reason,
I'm out.

07:13.833 --> 07:14.801
Thank you so much.
Yeah, thank you.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.369
Lori, what are you
gonna do?

07:16.369 --> 07:18.238
I'll tell you, I've been sitting
here, I've been listening.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.274
You know, I'm your customer.
I'm an advocate.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.143
But I have to be authentic,

07:23.143 --> 07:27.614
and I don't think
that you need a partner

07:27.614 --> 07:30.116
to just help you
get distribution centers,

07:30.116 --> 07:33.219
and I really don't think that
you need to give away equity.
Right.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.488
I just think that you need
a little bit of money,

07:35.488 --> 07:38.158
which you could get somewhere
else and not give away equity,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.392
so I want to be honest.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.395
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.964
Thank you very much,
Lori.
We so
appreciate that.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.098
Wow, there's one
fish left.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.500
All fish swim back
to Mr. Wonderful.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.536
Yeah.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.781
Four Sharks are out.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.017
Emily and Melissa have
an offer from Kevin,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.919
but he wants to be a 1/3 partner

08:05.919 --> 08:08.955
in their fish delivery company,
Fish Fixe.

08:08.955 --> 08:11.624
All fish swim back
to Mr. Wonderful.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.059
Yeah.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.198
You have to decide.
I don't have any flexibility.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.433
You have
no flexibility?
No.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.369
Melissa, you can
make a counteroffer.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.705
Kevin, 25%.
No.

08:25.705 --> 08:26.740
Oh, Kevin!

08:26.740 --> 08:28.575
I'll do it for 30%, okay?

08:28.575 --> 08:30.043
You'll do it for 30%?
Yeah.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.512
And you'll fund POs for us to
help us get this distribution?

08:32.512 --> 08:34.447
I'm not going to commit to
anything till actually see

08:34.447 --> 08:35.849
your income
and balance sheet statement...
Okay, yeah.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.018
...but that's not
your problem.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.519
It's direct‐to‐consumer,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.921
customer acquisition cost
that is the whole deal here.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.123
That's the whole problem.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.892
We know that 80%
of consumer goods

08:45.892 --> 08:47.293
are bought
by the moms, right?

08:47.293 --> 08:50.030
Correct.
How is your breakdown
to your audience?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.765
For my chef business,
it's a majority women.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.000
Oh, my gosh.
You are so good.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.603
It's a great thing because women
connect with ‐‐
Well, I mean, our entire goal
is to go social media.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.904
You should go online
and look at Chef Wonderful.

08:57.904 --> 08:59.272
Look at them.
Yeah, yeah.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.474
Melissa, are you going to give
up 30% of the business?

09:01.474 --> 09:03.076
You know this business
better than anybody.
Haven't you gone to all the
social media followers...

09:03.076 --> 09:05.145
Why don't you make
an offer, Robert? Why
don't you make an offer?

09:05.145 --> 09:06.346
...all the social media
chefs?

09:06.346 --> 09:08.481
This is a really hard
business.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.017
Guys, I never stand up
for Kevin, but I will here,

09:11.017 --> 09:13.686
simply because you guys
are floundering a little bit.
Yeah.

09:13.686 --> 09:14.888
You're floundering
on the ‐‐
Ahh.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.022
I'm not saying
you're not capable.

09:16.022 --> 09:17.857
There's
a big difference, right?

09:17.857 --> 09:19.793
You're more than capable.
You're super smart.
The fishies
are floundering.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.861
But you're floundering
financially, right?

09:21.861 --> 09:23.163
You're floundering
a little bit

09:23.163 --> 09:25.498
on your distribution
strategy,

09:25.498 --> 09:28.101
and you're floundering
on your marketing strategy.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.103
But given
your circumstances,

09:30.103 --> 09:31.638
he's gonna cover
a lot of the issues.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.174
You're getting money, right,
which is really going to help.
Yeah.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.643
You're gonna get access
to his mailing lists

09:36.643 --> 09:38.044
and his customer lists,

09:38.044 --> 09:40.280
and you're gonna get
some promotional element.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.382
And so, you know,
if you went out and just

09:42.382 --> 09:45.251
bought these independently,
they wouldn't be cheap.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.855
Kevin, 25%, and we will
be so efficient for you.
No. No.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.525
I know how much work this is,
and I know my value.
You won't wait on us. We will
knock it out of the park.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.227
This is hard.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.628
Say yes to 30%

09:55.628 --> 09:59.499
and you have a new lease on life
in this business.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.334
I don't do failure, okay?

10:01.334 --> 10:03.303
We don't, either.
Alright.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.605
So when I put my name
on something,

10:05.605 --> 10:07.941
there's no failure option.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.776
That hurts my brand.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.646
That's all I have to say on it.
30%, I'll do the deal.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.482
I don't want you
doing it for that.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.483
I don't care
what you want.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.817
Yeah, I do.

10:17.817 --> 10:19.886
I'll give you
the $200,000 for 25%.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.020
Wow.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.260
Lori, you have a deal!

10:27.260 --> 10:30.196
Yes!
Boom.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.631
Boom!

10:31.631 --> 10:32.699
Let's sell some fish!

10:32.699 --> 10:34.701
That's why they call it
the Shark Tank.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.402
Oh, my gosh.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.471
Can't let
you give away 30%.
That was awesome!

10:38.471 --> 10:39.939
Congrats, guys.
Well done.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.774
Kevin, we love you.
Thank you. Thank you.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.477
High‐five, ladies.
Whoo!

10:44.477 --> 10:46.146
Yes!

10:48.014 --> 10:49.616
Did that just happen?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.720
Oh, my God.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.822
Lori!

10:55.822 --> 10:58.191
We know Kevin would have been
a great partner,

10:58.191 --> 11:00.727
but I think Lori
really saw who we were

11:00.727 --> 11:02.529
and really believed
in our company.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.464
And, you know,
I just think that

11:04.464 --> 11:06.432
this is gonna be
the best partnership for us.

11:06.432 --> 11:08.268
Kevin didn't even see it coming.
He was stunned.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.369
Nobody did!

11:09.369 --> 11:11.104
I wouldn't have
ever done it for less...

11:11.104 --> 11:12.338
Back in, baby.
...so I congratulate
Lori.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.774
She is on a worldwide ride.
It's very hard.

11:14.774 --> 11:18.144
You know what happened?
Your greed. Your greed.

11:18.144 --> 11:21.447
Look, there's Mr. Wonderful,
and then there's Lori.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.954
In Season 11,
we watched Eric and Andy Bert

11:27.954 --> 11:29.455
make a deal with Kevin O'Leary

11:29.455 --> 11:31.758
for their innovative
pizza oven, Bertello.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.860
Imagine baking
wood‐fired pizza

11:33.860 --> 11:36.329
at over 900 degrees
in your own backyard.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.665
Let's see what
they're up to now.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.100
"Shark Tank" gave Bertello
an immediate boost.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.735
Within 24 hours
of airing,

11:42.735 --> 11:45.171
we had $75,000
in sales.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.539
But then
three days later,

11:46.539 --> 11:48.808
the country shut down
due to the pandemic,

11:48.808 --> 11:50.877
and we knew we had to
change our strategy.

11:50.877 --> 11:54.113
The biggest decision
was to focus on online sales.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.682
People are
cooking at home now,

11:55.682 --> 11:58.184
so we want to target
those people around the world.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.387
You'd be shocked at
how many people

12:01.387 --> 12:02.956
are sending me pictures
of pizza they made

12:02.956 --> 12:04.290
in their own backyards,

12:04.290 --> 12:07.193
and it really engages
and builds a sense of community.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.195
The decision to make
the digital pivot

12:09.195 --> 12:11.064
actually saved
our business.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.565
The year we pitched
to the Sharks,

12:12.565 --> 12:15.068
we did $640,000
in sales.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.736
Just 16 months later,

12:16.736 --> 12:20.807
we've hit $6.3 million
in sales.

12:20.807 --> 12:25.445
The combination of the pie
and the chef together,

12:25.445 --> 12:28.014
explaining how it works,
is how we sell these ovens.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.550
The key to helping
a company like Bertello

12:30.550 --> 12:32.352
is customer acquisition.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.355
Chef Wonderful here, and you
know I love to make pizza.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.523
I have millions
of social media followers.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.025
Everybody knows Chef Wonderful.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.728
And when I found this oven,
everybody got on board.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.530
This is the Bertello
Outdoor Pizza Oven.

12:44.530 --> 12:45.865
Then QVC came along.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.067
We've sold thousands
of Bertellos.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.936
People get them, they try them
in their backyards,

12:49.936 --> 12:52.405
they tell their neighbors,
and everybody wants one.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.473
Bertello, I love you.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.008
We love you, too,
Chef Wonderful.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.647
My advice for any entrepreneur
starting out would be

13:00.647 --> 13:03.049
A, you got to love the product
that you're developing

13:03.049 --> 13:04.217
and trying to sell.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.286
B, there's always gonna be
bumps in the road

13:06.286 --> 13:08.187
and you just have to ride
those bumps out.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.156
Stay positive,
work hard,

13:10.156 --> 13:13.126
and the more success
you're gonna have.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.462
The most rewarding thing
about selling Bertello ovens

13:16.462 --> 13:18.798
is bringing family
and friends together,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.833
and that is what
we built our business on.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.769
It's really helped
show my kids

13:22.769 --> 13:25.138
how you can build
a business and work hard

13:25.138 --> 13:27.140
and create something
out of nothing.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.523
Next up is a business

13:43.523 --> 13:47.226
that takes care of
an important aspect of marriage.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.738
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Julia Rodgers.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.306
And I'm Sarabeth Jaffe.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.710
We are here seeking
$150,000

14:03.710 --> 14:05.712
in exchange for 10%
of our company.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.514
Sharks, thank you
so much for joining us

14:08.514 --> 14:10.049
on this special day.

14:10.049 --> 14:14.053
A day like today requires
so much attention to detail,

14:14.053 --> 14:17.690
from the dress to the tuxedo,
the dinner to the dancing

14:17.690 --> 14:20.193
and the planning
could go on forever.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.095
I really love
my fiancé.

14:22.095 --> 14:24.430
Are you sure
you even know him?

14:24.430 --> 14:27.066
I don't think
he has any student debt.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.801
Is he gonna
cheat on you?

14:28.801 --> 14:31.904
I think we're gonna
stay together forever,

14:31.904 --> 14:33.506
but just in case...

14:33.506 --> 14:37.110
We're here to talk about
the most important topic.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.620
Prenups! Prenups!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.824
HelloPrenup.

14:51.824 --> 14:55.061
HelloPrenup is
the first digital platform

14:55.061 --> 14:57.296
to allow couples to create
a prenuptial agreement

14:57.296 --> 15:01.300
in hours instead of months
and for a fraction of the cost,

15:01.300 --> 15:03.870
without ever
leaving their couch.

15:03.870 --> 15:07.206
Young couples are getting
prenups more and more,

15:07.206 --> 15:09.542
but the traditional process
of getting a prenup

15:09.542 --> 15:13.579
is expensive, time‐consuming,
and a bit taboo.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.615
But with HelloPrenup,
the process

15:15.615 --> 15:19.752
is as easy
as one, two, three.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.554
Go to our website.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.524
Each fiancé completes
an in‐depth questionnaire

15:24.524 --> 15:27.794
detailing the terms
of their prenuptial agreement,

15:27.794 --> 15:31.497
as well as a comprehensive
financial disclosure.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.399
The happy couple
comes together to resolve

15:33.399 --> 15:36.803
any differences in their
answers, and boom ‐‐

15:36.803 --> 15:38.738
they can download
their prenuptial agreement

15:38.738 --> 15:42.141
and get back to planning
their special day.

15:42.141 --> 15:44.243
The total addressable
prenup market

15:44.243 --> 15:48.915
is valued at over
$550 million, Sharks.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.884
So what do you say,
Sharks?

15:51.884 --> 15:53.386
Will you
partner with us?

15:54.754 --> 15:55.922
So, guys, what are
your backgrounds,

15:55.922 --> 15:57.423
and how did you
get to this?

15:57.423 --> 16:00.927
I am a divorce attorney
at a top family law firm...

16:00.927 --> 16:03.062
Love that.
...in Boston,
Massachusetts.

16:03.062 --> 16:06.899
So over the last 10 years,
I've really spent a lot of time

16:06.899 --> 16:10.770
talking to thousands
of potential prenup clients,

16:10.770 --> 16:14.974
and they are looking for
an option that is collaborative,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.076
that is quick,
and that is cheaper

16:17.076 --> 16:19.145
than the traditional methods
out there.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.849
I realized what I really needed
was a technical co‐founder,

16:22.849 --> 16:26.619
and so Sarabeth and I
partnered in March of 2021.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.255
I am a software engineer
by trade.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.591
I landed my first
full‐time job at Microsoft,

16:31.591 --> 16:35.127
and I recently
got engaged.
Congrats.

16:35.127 --> 16:36.329
When I looked
into prenups,

16:36.329 --> 16:38.998
I found that there was
really no good solution.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.299
I came across
HelloPrenup.

16:40.299 --> 16:41.968
I cold‐emailed her,

16:41.968 --> 16:43.603
and we've been working
together,

16:43.603 --> 16:46.873
through Zoom, actually,
for the last six months.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.441
We just met
last night.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.610
Oh, my gosh. Really?
Yeah.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.578
And how many prenups
have you written?

16:52.578 --> 16:56.349
We've written over
25 prenups.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.217
You've written 25?

16:58.217 --> 17:00.086
Yes. We've had a few struggles
with the software,

17:00.086 --> 17:01.387
which is where
I came in.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.123
It's took me about two years
in total to develop,

17:04.123 --> 17:06.959
so I funded this
100% myself,

17:06.959 --> 17:09.061
so I used
overseas developers

17:09.061 --> 17:12.465
and then I soft‐launched
in March of 2020.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.434
Now, 2020 was a tough year
for weddings.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.469
We all know that.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.637
How much have you made?

17:17.637 --> 17:21.007
Yeah, so we've made $20,000
in lifetime sales.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.909
That's mostly
because our platform

17:22.909 --> 17:24.610
was not really
operational.

17:24.610 --> 17:26.078
For all of 2020 ‐‐
No excuses.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.114
I just just asked.
Yes.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.448
So let's talk about
the next year.

17:29.448 --> 17:30.750
What were you going to make?

17:30.750 --> 17:34.287
Yes, our projection, our most
conservative projection

17:34.287 --> 17:37.256
is $4.1 million.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.492
Oh, my gosh.
I loved you until that.
Okay, great projection.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.994
That is
an absolute dream.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.062
It is a dream, guys.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.833
So what does one cost?
Well, hang on.

17:47.833 --> 17:48.968
What does one cost?
Great question.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.837
So, a prenup through us
costs $599.

17:51.837 --> 17:55.207
The average prenup
costs $5,000.

17:55.207 --> 17:57.543
The number‐one cost
is customer acquisition.

17:57.543 --> 18:01.213
So our customer acquisition
costs are very high right now.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.715
We're currently
not profitable.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.885
However, we are a tech company,
and right now,

18:05.885 --> 18:08.387
we are the number‐one
source of information

18:08.387 --> 18:13.125
on prenuptial agreements
online in the entire Internet.
Good for you.
That's smart.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.261
This is a space
I've been in a long time.

18:15.261 --> 18:18.030
But because you
actually don't yet know

18:18.030 --> 18:20.733
your customer acquisition cost,
I would need to know that,

18:20.733 --> 18:23.536
because I don't know whether
you're worth $1.5 million

18:23.536 --> 18:25.504
or whether you're worth
$10 million or...

18:25.504 --> 18:28.341
Our customer acquisition cost
will be basically zero

18:28.341 --> 18:30.242
in 60 days.
Will be. Will be.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.279
In 60 days!
And I wish that to be the case,
but I don't know that yet.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.648
And actually, Mr. Wonderful,
before you say anything else ‐‐
I'm out. I'm out.

18:35.648 --> 18:36.949
Aw.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.217
Thank you for your time.
Well, ladies, listen.

18:38.217 --> 18:41.020
Listen, I think what
you've done is genius.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.322
Thank you.
I think you are
right on the money.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.091
I do think
you're really early

18:45.091 --> 18:47.360
and you're right
at the precipice of it.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.862
But I'm sorry ‐‐
too early for me.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.197
I'm out.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.800
Guys, while I think
it's a good business

18:54.800 --> 18:56.636
and you're on
a great path,

18:56.636 --> 18:59.639
there's just so many issues
for me.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.741
Okay.
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.310
I understand.
Thank you so much.
Okay, well, thank you so much.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.513
Guys, for me, intuitively,
it feels like

19:07.513 --> 19:09.749
somebody who really
wants a prenup

19:09.749 --> 19:12.652
is still gonna
go to a lawyer.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.788
And other people are gonna
go to you for information.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.491
Could be wrong.
I wish you all the success.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.659
But for me...
You know what?
Before you ‐‐

19:19.659 --> 19:20.960
Before you go out!
For me...

19:20.960 --> 19:23.129
Before you go any further,
Robert!
I got to go!

19:23.129 --> 19:24.864
I'm out. I'm out.
Give us a second,
Robert!

19:24.864 --> 19:26.532
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.201
You know, if people really want
a prenup, a lot of times,

19:29.201 --> 19:30.770
you know ‐‐
They're gonna
get a lawyer.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.773
Millennials don't ‐‐
Millennials want ‐‐
They want prenups.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.541
They want to get
prenups,

19:35.541 --> 19:39.111
or their parents who are
about to pass down

19:39.111 --> 19:42.214
$60 trillion
in wealth to them,

19:42.214 --> 19:43.516
want them
to get prenups.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.084
And then
the millennials say,

19:45.084 --> 19:47.553
"Ahh, this is
an awkward conversation.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.655
I really don't want to go
to a divorce lawyer."

19:49.655 --> 19:51.123
Who wants to hire
a divorce lawyer

19:51.123 --> 19:52.491
before they
get married?

19:52.491 --> 19:54.627
And so then
they go online...
Well said.

19:54.627 --> 19:58.097
...they find HelloPrenup,
they satisfy their parents.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.934
They create a valid prenuptial
agreement, and they're done.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.170
The process is painless.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.272
It's all great advice,
but I don't think

20:06.272 --> 20:08.741
any of these guys
have seen what I've seen,

20:08.741 --> 20:10.476
which is,
there are two ways

20:10.476 --> 20:13.412
to start tech companies
in Silicon Valley.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.648
One way is to go get
a lot of venture capital

20:15.648 --> 20:17.650
and go big or go home.
Yeah.

20:17.650 --> 20:22.221
The other way is to be scrappy,
to be entrepreneurial.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.323
Right, we've never seen that.
Never seen that.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.325
I've never seen that!

20:26.325 --> 20:28.594
Well, you're seeing it
right now.
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.262
You are seeing it
right now.

20:30.262 --> 20:34.200
I believe in you guys.
I believe in the space.
Thank you so much.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.903
I do believe there's a market,
and I think it will come to you.

20:37.903 --> 20:43.342
I would be happy to put
$150,000 in for 30%.

20:48.414 --> 20:50.783
So tell me, am I coming along
for the ride?

20:50.783 --> 20:53.919
Well, that is a bit high
for equity, for us.
You can counter.

20:57.056 --> 21:00.593
Ladies, you have $20,000
in lifetime sales,

21:00.593 --> 21:04.196
and now you have an offer
from the founder of Nextdoor.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.832
What are you
even thinking about?

21:09.468 --> 21:10.770
I love Nextdoor,
by the way.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.072
I'm a user.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.840
I'm sticking at 30%.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.644
But we have worked so hard
to build this company.

21:18.644 --> 21:19.779
Cry me a river.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.982
I put $130,000
of my own money into this.

21:22.982 --> 21:25.050
Alright, give me a counter.
Give me a counter.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.219
So we would like
to counter

21:27.219 --> 21:32.124
$150,000 for 20%.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.926
Let's meet in the middle.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.495
I'll come down to the 25%
and you got a deal,

21:36.495 --> 21:39.498
because I believe
in you guys.

21:39.498 --> 21:42.668
Is there any way that we
could include another Shark?
What are you ‐‐

21:42.668 --> 21:44.870
If we're giving
that much equity away?

21:44.870 --> 21:46.806
I forgot that I'm working
with an attorney here.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.841
Kevin, Kevin.
I don't know
if that's a good thing.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.911
We really do want to integrate
this as a regular thing

21:51.911 --> 21:53.179
in the wedding industry.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.881
Adding this as an option
onto your wedding registry.

21:55.881 --> 21:57.817
Hang on a sec.
Do you know who he is?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.952
Yeah. Why do you
need another Shark?

21:59.952 --> 22:02.655
He's not good enough
and you want to go to Kevin?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.890
No,
we're not saying that!

22:04.890 --> 22:06.659
No, but let's face it.
I have the databases already.
No, we feel so honored
to receive an offer.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.060
I've got the names.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.728
We just ‐‐
I don't know if Nirav
wants a partner,

22:09.728 --> 22:11.697
okay, but if there's going
to be a partnership,

22:11.697 --> 22:15.467
I'd go in for 50% with him,
but I want 15%.

22:15.467 --> 22:17.136
Otherwise,
why am I getting out of bed?

22:17.136 --> 22:19.071
That's a no‐brainer
for you guys.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.973
$150,000 for 30%?

22:20.973 --> 22:24.210
I will accept that because
I want the best for you.
You got to do that,
guys.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.945
Do you accept
the offer?

22:28.714 --> 22:30.316
Yes, we accept that offer.
We accept.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.519
Well done.
Good job, rookie.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.520
Good job, girls.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.956
Say "I do."
We do!

22:36.956 --> 22:38.290
‐We do!
‐Congratulations.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.059
‐Thank you so much!
‐Super excited.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.260
Congratulations.
‐We're thrilled.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.561
Ready?
Here we go.

22:42.561 --> 22:45.865
One, two, three.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.168
There we go!
They can catch, too.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.269
Congratulations, guys.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.470
Yay!

22:51.470 --> 22:52.805
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.074
Yes! Yeah!

22:55.074 --> 22:58.344
This is gonna generate
so much cash with no expenses.

22:58.344 --> 23:01.180
You guys will
do well with that.
You guys have no idea.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.315
This is how people
become millionaires.

23:03.315 --> 23:05.618
So excited.
Oh, my God.

23:05.618 --> 23:08.053
We met about six months ago
over Zoom,

23:08.053 --> 23:11.490
and since partnering,
you know, we got into the Tank.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.260
We made a deal
with two amazing Sharks,

23:14.260 --> 23:16.462
and now we're ready
to work harder than ever

23:16.462 --> 23:18.264
to scale this business.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.543
Next in the Tank

23:31.543 --> 23:34.346
is an indulgence
with a modern twist.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.124
Hi, Sharks.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.660
My name is Sabeena Ladha.
I'm from Dallas, Texas.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.863
Yeah!
And I currently live
in Los Angeles, California.

23:50.863 --> 23:55.334
I'm seeking $300,000
for 10% of my company, Deux.

23:55.334 --> 23:56.568
Wow.

23:56.568 --> 23:57.836
Over the past year,

23:57.836 --> 24:00.873
I've started taking
fistfuls of supplements ‐‐

24:00.873 --> 24:03.042
everything from zinc
and elderberry

24:03.042 --> 24:04.543
to boost my immune system

24:04.543 --> 24:07.379
to aloe vera and vitamin C
for my skin,

24:07.379 --> 24:10.115
and even ashwagandha
to calm myself down.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.551
I may seem like
your typical L. A. health nut,

24:12.551 --> 24:15.387
but I love junk food.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.256
I mean, I grew up on the stuff.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.659
Introducing Deux,
enhanced cookie dough

24:20.659 --> 24:23.595
packed with vitamins
and functional ingredients.

24:23.595 --> 24:25.331
A lot of other
raw cookie doughs are made with

24:25.331 --> 24:28.100
things like refined sugars
and preservatives

24:28.100 --> 24:29.501
and animal byproducts.

24:29.501 --> 24:32.171
Our cookie dough
is made with things like oats,

24:32.171 --> 24:34.974
almond butter,
flaxseed, and coconut sugar.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.610
We've added in good‐for‐you,
functional ingredients.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.647
For example, this jar
of Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough

24:41.647 --> 24:46.585
has the same amount of zinc
as three pounds of chickpeas.

24:46.585 --> 24:50.923
This jar of Brownie Batter
has the same amount of vitamin C

24:50.923 --> 24:53.659
as five whole oranges.

24:53.659 --> 24:57.997
We've made everything delicious,
gluten‐free, and vegan,

24:57.997 --> 24:59.698
especially for you, Mark.

24:59.698 --> 25:03.369
Now, Sharks, who's ready to
invest and roll in some Deux?

25:03.369 --> 25:05.504
Let's go! Let's go!
What are we trying?
What are we trying?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.072
Sharks, in front of you

25:07.072 --> 25:09.274
we have our four flavors
of cookie dough.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.310
You can eat them raw
straight from the jar,

25:11.310 --> 25:13.245
or you can make
ooey‐gooey cookies.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.114
So we've got some cookies
for you as well.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.415
Mmm.
Really good.

25:16.415 --> 25:20.085
So this 110 calories ‐‐
is this the serving?

25:20.085 --> 25:22.354
Yeah, I would say
about that size.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.089
We're not really
calorie‐focused.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.691
We're focused more on
the clean ingredients.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.493
That's obvious.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.995
Are you a food person?
How did you come up with this?

25:29.995 --> 25:32.231
So my parents are immigrants,
and my dad ‐‐
Where'd they
immigrate from?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.867
My mom was born in Pakistan,
and my dad was born in India.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.202
My dad didn't have
much of an education,

25:37.202 --> 25:39.338
and he kind of
saved up enough money

25:39.338 --> 25:41.807
to buy a gas station,
and he lived there.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.143
I mean,
14 hours a day, 7 days a week.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.978
Like, it's a grind.
Wow.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.714
And you know who else
lived there? This girl.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.315
And so I had all of my meals

25:50.315 --> 25:52.017
in that gas station
on the weekends.

25:52.017 --> 25:55.320
You know, Oreos for breakfast,
Honey Buns for lunch.
You did?

25:55.320 --> 25:58.957
I would make Kraft Mac & Cheese
in the microwave for dinner.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.426
So no surprise, after college,

26:00.426 --> 26:02.795
my first job was working
at one of the biggest

26:02.795 --> 26:04.897
food and beverage CPG
companies in the world.

26:04.897 --> 26:08.934
But I was going through kind of
a health transformation myself,

26:08.934 --> 26:10.135
and it was just at odds.

26:10.135 --> 26:13.705
So I got out of
food and beverage completely,

26:13.705 --> 26:15.307
and then I went
to venture capital.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.842
I knew I was entrepreneurial
by nature,

26:16.842 --> 26:18.744
so I wanted to learn
the startup world.
Wow.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.579
And when did you
launch Deux?

26:20.579 --> 26:23.382
I concepted Deux
in June of 2020.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.551
Oh, so you're
brand new.
I launched it ‐‐ Brand new.

26:25.551 --> 26:26.652
Oh, wow, okay.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.220
But my numbers
will tell you otherwise.

26:28.220 --> 26:30.689
- We did 70
- K
from October to December,

26:30.689 --> 26:34.927
- and we've done 630
- K
in revenue thus far.
What?!

26:34.927 --> 26:36.195
Good for you.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.163
And we're on track
to do $1.2 million this year.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.365
How? How are you selling
that much?

26:40.365 --> 26:42.701
And we just got approved
at Whole Foods this morning,

26:42.701 --> 26:44.236
literally,
like three hours ago.
Congratulations.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.604
Congratulations. Well done.
Good day.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.738
I know.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.540
How many Whole Foods
are you going into?

26:48.540 --> 26:50.642
So it's about 40 stores,
and then ‐‐

26:50.642 --> 26:51.777
And what are they
gonna sell it for,

26:51.777 --> 26:53.579
and what are you
selling it to them for?

26:53.579 --> 26:54.847
And what
does it cost you?

26:54.847 --> 26:57.015
So it costs us $3.70

26:57.015 --> 26:59.017
to make, landed
at our fulfillment center,

26:59.017 --> 27:01.587
and we charge $15 a jar
online.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.222
$15?
A jar?

27:03.222 --> 27:04.756
Wow.
Is that a premium?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.358
It is. It's a premium.
Yeah, definitely.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.127
How much money
have you raised?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.595
I raised a million dollars.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.363
Wow.
Wow.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.397
At what valuation?

27:12.397 --> 27:13.699
At a $6 million cap.

27:13.699 --> 27:14.600
‐
‐Whoa.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.434
‐Good for you.
‐Nice work.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.703
You are impressive.

27:17.703 --> 27:18.570
Thank you.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.738
You know how to sell.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.340
Sabeena, 13 years,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.343
you're probably one of the most
impressive entrepreneurs

27:24.343 --> 27:25.811
that's stood
on that carpet.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.346
I wish you all the success
in the world.

27:27.346 --> 27:31.183
You're incredibly impressive,
but I don't like sweets.

27:31.183 --> 27:34.052
I got to really want to try
and eat the product,

27:34.052 --> 27:35.454
and I eat everything.

27:35.454 --> 27:37.089
This isn't for me.
I'm out.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.658
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.360
When I look at this,

27:41.360 --> 27:43.762
I would love to have it
be even healthier.

27:43.762 --> 27:47.566
Mm‐hmm
Because that's just where
my mind goes as a consumer.

27:47.566 --> 27:50.068
So it's not really
the right match,

27:50.068 --> 27:52.104
but I think you've done
a good job of what you've done.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.405
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

27:53.405 --> 27:55.340
Thank you.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.210
Sabeena, there is so much
to admire about you.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.045
My parents immigrated
from India.

28:00.045 --> 28:02.114
I felt so close to you
when you told that story.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.883
What do you think your father
would think of you right now,

28:04.883 --> 28:06.552
following this
entrepreneurial dream

28:06.552 --> 28:09.454
and on "Shark Tank"?

28:09.454 --> 28:12.157
Yeah, I mean...

28:12.157 --> 28:13.926
I didn't mean to get choked up.

28:13.926 --> 28:18.463
Um... I‐I think he would tell me
I'm crazy, probably,

28:18.463 --> 28:20.799
'cause he did it
because he had to do it

28:20.799 --> 28:22.734
and I do it
because I get to do it.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.002
And so he'd probably think
I was crazy,

28:24.002 --> 28:26.939
but he would be,
you know, over the moon.

28:26.939 --> 28:29.608
I bet you he's
extremely proud of you.
Thank you.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.078
And you are living your version
of the American dream.

28:33.078 --> 28:36.348
I would love to back you,
but I'm an Internet guy.

28:36.348 --> 28:38.951
Yep.
I realize that this
just really isn't for me.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.419
I'm out.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.521
I appreciate it.
Thanks, Nirav.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.523
I, too,
was very impressed.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.325
But at
the end of the day,

28:46.325 --> 28:48.393
I don't eat
this kind of food anymore.

28:48.393 --> 28:50.596
Yeah.
Now I'm not a kid
and now I have to care.

28:50.596 --> 28:53.699
Well, you're, I would say ‐‐
I mean, with all due respect,

28:53.699 --> 28:56.602
you're not exactly
the target consumer.
Whoa!

28:56.602 --> 28:59.104
I get it. I get it.
You're old!
Say it!

28:59.104 --> 29:01.807
That's not what
I was trying to say!
Yes, you were.

29:01.807 --> 29:04.243
I am the target investor.
That's the point.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.111
And I'm just telling you,
I can't invest in it.

29:06.111 --> 29:08.113
I'm sorry.
I'm out.

29:08.113 --> 29:11.316
I appreciate it.
Thank you, Kevin.

29:11.316 --> 29:12.751
Mark?

29:12.751 --> 29:16.622
Sabeena, on one hand,
look, we're not your demo.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.790
But at the same time,
the calories are the calories,

29:18.790 --> 29:20.926
and too many kids
gaining too much weight

29:20.926 --> 29:23.228
is still a real problem
in this country.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.631
If there was something here
that I could hang my hat on

29:25.631 --> 29:28.133
to say as an alternative,
I'd probably go for it,

29:28.133 --> 29:29.901
because I think
you're incredible.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.670
But it's not there,
so for those reasons, I'm out.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.742
I guess just one thing,
before we wrap up.
Sure.

29:36.742 --> 29:40.345
I, like ‐‐ This is
the culmination of my career.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.849
There is no other person
that is more set

29:43.849 --> 29:47.052
to scale a business like this
than me.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.187
Sabeena, you are
super impressive.
Thank you.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.990
But, Sabeena, you had
a problem reading the room.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.726
And that's one of the challenges
when it came to you,

29:54.726 --> 29:56.928
whether it was a comment
to Kevin,

29:56.928 --> 29:59.131
we're not your demo,
'cause you were very clear.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.899
But you got to read the room
to at least try

30:00.899 --> 30:02.467
to make us feel good

30:02.467 --> 30:05.737
about who we are
in investing.
Uh...

30:05.737 --> 30:08.440
Look, and I'm not trying
to rip on her, right?
I'm just telling her ‐‐

30:08.440 --> 30:10.342
I don't know
if that's fair, Mark.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.910
I think she
read the room.
It may not be fair. I'm just
telling you what I felt.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.445
No, I'll take that feedback.
Yeah, I appreciate it.

30:13.445 --> 30:14.680
You can have
your opinion.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.648
I can look at a product
I may not like,

30:16.648 --> 30:18.183
but I respect the person,
an entrepreneur.
Oh, no.

30:18.183 --> 30:19.918
I think she's phenomenal.
I think she's super smart.

30:19.918 --> 30:21.286
But it's more
the product, right?

30:21.286 --> 30:22.387
I don't want to
diminish you at all,

30:22.387 --> 30:23.755
'cause you are phenomenal.

30:23.755 --> 30:27.726
Sabeena, I got to tell you,
I just want to back you.

30:27.726 --> 30:30.095
I can guide you
as the business grows.

30:30.095 --> 30:32.097
Yep.
But I want to be
completely honest.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.033
Don't come to me and tell me
which of the products ‐‐

30:35.033 --> 30:37.669
I can't add
any value that way.

30:37.669 --> 30:42.708
Yeah.
This is purely
an investment in Sabeena,

30:42.708 --> 30:44.476
and I think you're not
gonna fail.

30:44.476 --> 30:45.944
I appreciate that.

30:45.944 --> 30:48.980
I'll give you
the $300,000 for 15%.

30:50.949 --> 30:52.751
Okay.

30:52.751 --> 30:56.288
I came in knowing
I would have to take a haircut.

30:56.288 --> 30:58.190
I'm not gonna
negotiate with you.

31:02.427 --> 31:08.300
Would you do $300,000
for...

31:08.300 --> 31:10.936
12.5%
and meet me in the middle?

31:10.936 --> 31:13.071
Every other person
except you,

31:13.071 --> 31:16.007
I would almost be insulted
by a counter like that.

31:16.007 --> 31:20.245
I mean, it's so trivial.
But let's reset.

31:20.245 --> 31:24.349
$300,000 for 15%.
That's my offer.

31:26.685 --> 31:31.490
Would you do 10%
and 5% AdvisorShares?

31:31.490 --> 31:33.759
No. No, I'm not
gonna do it.

31:33.759 --> 31:37.195
I'm not gonna do it.
I wanted to believe in you.

31:37.195 --> 31:40.232
Sometimes you make a bet because
your heart tells you one thing.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.767
I didn't want you to
leave without a deal,

31:41.767 --> 31:43.668
but I also believed in you
and the business.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.170
Alright, I'll take it.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.238
No, I'm not
gonna do it.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.674
Whoa.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.743
I'm not gonna
do it.

31:51.743 --> 31:56.448
I wanted to do it,
but you don't need me

31:56.448 --> 31:58.817
as much as I wanted to invest
in you.

31:58.817 --> 32:01.486
I mean, I don't. I'm not trying
to be difficult with you.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.455
I would have been
happy to mentor you,

32:03.455 --> 32:05.190
but when you keep
negotiating me down,

32:05.190 --> 32:07.893
I mean, I just ‐‐
Like, I can't do it.
Just one counteroffer.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.761
You're gonna be fine.
Congrats, Sabeena.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.762
Best of luck.
Thanks.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.863
Congrats on
your progress.

32:11.863 --> 32:13.465
Thank you.

32:18.403 --> 32:21.339
I'm disappointed,
but when a door closes,

32:21.339 --> 32:22.974
another one opens,
and I just don't know

32:22.974 --> 32:24.810
what that door is
that's opening yet.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.412
You know, this is another
"no" notch on my belt,

32:27.412 --> 32:28.747
and we're gonna keep going.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.450
I thought I offered her
a good deal.
You did.

32:31.450 --> 32:33.518
It's such
an important lesson, though.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.721
You cannot squeeze that last bit
of blood out of the stone.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.658
Well, when five Sharks are out,
one comes back in,

32:39.658 --> 32:42.627
you got one offer,
it's not the time to negotiate.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.628
Read the room.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.642
Next up is a safe way

32:57.642 --> 33:00.445
to get tasks done
around the house.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.921
Hi, Sharks.

33:09.921 --> 33:12.858
My name is Dave Heimbuch,
and I'm here from Dallas, Texas.

33:12.858 --> 33:15.060
Dallas!
I'm seeking $300,000

33:15.060 --> 33:16.995
for 8% equity in my company.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.063
Wow.

33:18.063 --> 33:20.332
Sharks, this is Rose.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.767
Rose lives alone
and sometimes needs help

33:22.767 --> 33:24.703
with projects around the house,

33:24.703 --> 33:28.173
like moving heavy furniture...

33:28.173 --> 33:30.208
...or hanging a priceless
work of art

33:30.208 --> 33:34.246
and constant other tasks
that always seem to pop up.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.848
So what can she do?
Who can she ask for help?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.517
Rose has been burned before,

33:38.517 --> 33:40.919
and she will only let
someone into her home
that she can trust.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.056
Sharks, meet Daniel.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.158
My hero!

33:48.493 --> 33:50.629
Dan is clearly a firefighter,

33:50.629 --> 33:52.998
and he happens to live
in Rose's neighborhood.

33:52.998 --> 33:55.934
He's a trusted member of their
community, but that's not all.

33:55.934 --> 33:58.370
He's also extremely handy.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.806
Oh, yeah.

34:01.806 --> 34:03.441
He's very strong.

34:05.677 --> 34:11.383
And all firefighters will take
care of your prized work of art.

34:13.718 --> 34:16.321
How did Dan know
that Rose needed help?

34:16.321 --> 34:17.856
If only there was an easy way.

34:17.856 --> 34:20.592
That is why I created Hidrent.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.827
Dan simply downloaded
the Hidrent pro mobile app

34:22.827 --> 34:24.896
onto his phone and registered.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.898
He soon received
a notification from Rose

34:26.898 --> 34:29.034
that she needed help
with a home project.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.369
Dan was able to see
the details of the work.

34:31.369 --> 34:33.438
He quickly accepted the job,

34:33.438 --> 34:35.807
and then he messaged Rose
to schedule.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.709
Upon completion,

34:37.709 --> 34:40.445
Dan entered the total number
of hours that he worked.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.747
This submitted an invoice
for Rose to pay

34:42.747 --> 34:44.549
and for Dan to get paid,

34:44.549 --> 34:46.217
all within the Hidrent platform.

34:46.217 --> 34:48.753
Sharks, which one of you
wants to sound the alarm

34:48.753 --> 34:52.090
to join our team and add
some more fuel to this fire?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.825
Good job.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.961
Dan, Rose, thank you
so much for your help.

34:55.961 --> 34:57.729
Mr. Wonderful,
call me.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.999
Bye, Rose.

35:00.999 --> 35:04.836
So I think this concept
is really wonderful.

35:04.836 --> 35:05.937
Great idea.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.872
What made you
come up with this idea?

35:07.872 --> 35:10.408
So I'm actually not
a firefighter.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.378
My background is actually
in digital marketing and sales.

35:13.378 --> 35:15.013
I've worked for a lot of
different startups there,

35:15.013 --> 35:16.414
most notably with Shazam,

35:16.414 --> 35:18.583
and I knew that someday,
if I had the right idea,

35:18.583 --> 35:20.318
that I wanted to start
my own company.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.753
And then during this time,

35:21.753 --> 35:24.122
I married into
a family of firefighters

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
and it was my brother‐in‐law,
who's a firefighter.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.727
I was doing some home repair
work on my house, and I said,

35:28.727 --> 35:30.228
"Hey, I used this
really cool app

35:30.228 --> 35:32.330
and I got a contractor over
and he did this work,"

35:32.330 --> 35:33.665
and I was telling him
about it.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.433
He's like, "That's great, Dave,
but I could do that.

35:35.433 --> 35:37.235
You know, everybody
at the station does that."

35:37.235 --> 35:38.903
And then my marketing mind
started kicking in,

35:38.903 --> 35:41.406
and with his help and
the help of other firefighters,

35:41.406 --> 35:43.274
I built it.
How long have you been
in business,

35:43.274 --> 35:44.976
and what have
your sales been to date?

35:44.976 --> 35:47.045
Yeah, so we launched in 2018.

35:47.045 --> 35:49.381
Lifetime sales, $850,000.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.415
Good for you.
That's gross sales?

35:50.415 --> 35:52.417
2019, $125,000.

35:52.417 --> 35:55.954
2020, $260,000.
Wow.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.757
Year‐to‐date, $325,000.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.493
And what is your percentage
of those gross sales?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.428
So we take 23%.

36:03.428 --> 36:05.897
We will charge the homeowner
about $72 an hour.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.333
We will pay the firefighter
about $60 an hour.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.135
What we found out right away
was that

36:10.135 --> 36:13.204
the majority of our customers
were senior citizens,

36:13.204 --> 36:14.939
so we launched
in Phoenix and Tampa.

36:14.939 --> 36:17.475
Ah, smart.
And those are the markets
that we're in now.

36:17.475 --> 36:18.943
How does Rose
find you?

36:18.943 --> 36:20.445
Google, Facebook, and Nextdoor.

36:20.445 --> 36:22.347
First of all,
I love this idea.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.283
I love the idea of connecting
amazing neighborhood heroes

36:25.283 --> 36:27.519
like firefighters
for everyday tasks.
Yes.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.788
Thank you for advertising
on the platform.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.157
We're in 99%
of American neighborhoods,

36:32.157 --> 36:33.625
one of three
households.
Wow.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.060
But I will tell you,

36:35.060 --> 36:37.429
that part that you said
you're responsible for,

36:37.429 --> 36:40.031
which is getting people to come
to the app and download it

36:40.031 --> 36:42.767
or go to the website
and try your product...
Mm‐hmm, right.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.202
...that is not trivial.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.206
It took us 10 years to
get to where we are today.
Wow.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.608
We have over 50 million
registered users

36:50.608 --> 36:53.611
and we've never spent
a dollar of advertising.

36:53.611 --> 36:54.946
Wow.
Wow.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.314
That's crazy.
Really?

36:56.314 --> 36:57.849
That's amazing.
That's real magic
on the Internet.

36:57.849 --> 36:59.751
You're building
a marketplace.
Yes.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.052
And you're operating
in one of

37:01.052 --> 37:04.055
the most difficult sectors
online, which is local.

37:04.055 --> 37:07.926
So he literally has to go
neighborhood‐to‐neighborhood,

37:07.926 --> 37:09.127
the way we did
with Nextdoor.

37:09.127 --> 37:10.261
Do you know how many
neighborhoods there are

37:10.261 --> 37:11.963
in the United States?
No.

37:11.963 --> 37:14.032
There are over
250,000.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.467
Wow.

37:15.467 --> 37:18.603
For you to do this and try
to build a company on your own,

37:18.603 --> 37:21.106
it feels a little rough.

37:21.106 --> 37:22.874
It's
hand‐to‐hand combat.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.477
You have to do it
one neighborhood at a time.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.712
I don't know if I agree.
And it will take many years.

37:27.712 --> 37:28.913
I don't know
if I agree with,

37:28.913 --> 37:31.116
we have to do it one
neighborhood at a time.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.917
And the reason I say that
is because

37:32.917 --> 37:35.620
there are fire stations
everywhere, right?

37:35.620 --> 37:38.456
Not just in the big cities,
but also in the rural areas...
Small towns everywhere.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.858
...in the middle of nowhere.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.860
Look, I feel like
you're a kindred spirit.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.596
I admire so much about
what you're doing.
Thank you.

37:44.596 --> 37:48.299
But the truth is, I have spent
the last decade of my life

37:48.299 --> 37:51.035
building a company
that's not so dissimilar

37:51.035 --> 37:52.871
from what you have
in your hands.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.305
I wish you
all the luck,

37:54.305 --> 37:56.207
but I've done my journey
in neighborhoods.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.742
For that reason,
I'm out.

37:57.742 --> 37:58.977
Thank you, Nirav.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.479
How do you open up more
neighborhoods without a team?

38:01.479 --> 38:03.381
But why not leverage yourself
and hire a few people?

38:03.381 --> 38:05.750
I'm on my computer,
buying ads on Facebook,

38:05.750 --> 38:07.519
changing out the creative,
changing out the copy.
Just you?

38:07.519 --> 38:08.920
Yes.
Wow.

38:08.920 --> 38:12.257
Why don't you get a few more
people doing the same thing?

38:12.257 --> 38:14.492
I would love to, if I had
some money to do that.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.528
You want to try to
control your own destiny.
Yeah.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.264
I just don't see a path
to controlling your own destiny

38:19.264 --> 38:20.632
through digital ad spend.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.833
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.701
Okay.
Thanks for the time, Mark.

38:23.701 --> 38:26.471
It's a brilliant idea.
Thank you.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.872
The logo's great.

38:27.872 --> 38:29.874
I don't know
it's a contract or service.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.209
Okay. Okay.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.912
I love everything, but you got
to get that in there.

38:33.912 --> 38:36.915
Okay.
Look, Dave, I don't know
if it's gonna work or not,

38:36.915 --> 38:39.918
but I think the way to go
to market is senior citizens.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.519
It is.
And women!

38:41.519 --> 38:45.423
My wife would refer this
to her friends.
It is, 100%. Right.

38:45.423 --> 38:48.459
So, listen,
I'll make you an offer.

38:48.459 --> 38:50.061
Okay, great.

38:50.061 --> 38:54.499
I'll give you the $300,000,
but I want 20%.

38:54.499 --> 38:57.001
Okay.
Thank you for that offer.

38:57.001 --> 38:58.703
Since I'm only gonna
be here once,

38:58.703 --> 39:00.171
and Lori and Kevin haven't...

39:00.171 --> 39:01.239
I'll help you make
a decision here,

39:01.239 --> 39:03.208
'cause I'm all about
a return of capital.

39:03.208 --> 39:04.542
I think the idea's brilliant.
I really do.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.577
Thank you.
I really do.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.479
But you're
in a longer slog here.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.381
For me, it's not the journey
I want to take. I'm out.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.116
Alright.
Thank you, Kevin.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.618
So, you know me ‐‐

39:13.618 --> 39:15.920
I have a very soft spot
for firemen.

39:15.920 --> 39:17.755
I know.
So I love it.

39:17.755 --> 39:19.824
I would like to go in
with Robert.

39:19.824 --> 39:20.959
Okay.
Because I think that ‐‐

39:20.959 --> 39:22.660
I like Lori.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.231
I think the two of us together
have different skillsets...

39:26.231 --> 39:29.167
Sure.
...that can be complementary
and that can help you.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.602
We need to
change the name.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.036
Yes.
It needs to be intuitive.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.505
Okay.
But, Robert,
for me to come in with you,

39:34.505 --> 39:37.242
you were at $300,000
for 20%.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.377
So we're gonna need
more than 20%.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.845
Ouch.
It's just not enough.

39:40.845 --> 39:43.147
It's just not enough
for either of us.
Okay.

39:43.147 --> 39:45.450
I was thinking
$300,000 for 35%.

39:45.450 --> 39:47.418
For 35%?

39:47.418 --> 39:48.653
You're allowed to
counter, Dave.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.867
Three Sharks are out.

40:02.867 --> 40:06.104
Dave has an offer from
Lori and Robert for Hidrent,

40:06.104 --> 40:09.140
an app that matches firefighters
with handyman jobs,

40:09.140 --> 40:11.609
but they want a much bigger
stake in the company

40:11.609 --> 40:15.013
than the 8% he came in offering.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.382
I was thinking
$300,000 for 35%.

40:17.382 --> 40:18.783
For 35%?

40:18.783 --> 40:19.851
Oh.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.452
You're allowed
to counter, Dave.

40:21.452 --> 40:25.156
This industry is a $500 million
home service industry.

40:25.156 --> 40:26.357
Oh, don't go there.
It is.

40:26.357 --> 40:27.659
Don't go there.
No, no, no. Don't go there.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.194
There is a lot of upside,
and I appreciate that offer,

40:30.194 --> 40:32.163
but that equity
at that valuation...

40:32.163 --> 40:33.965
That's a million‐dollar
valuation.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.433
If you can get these guys
to help you...

40:35.433 --> 40:37.135
Dave, you've got to
price the risk.
...I'd take it.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.536
I mean, that's what our offer
is ‐‐ for pricing and the risk.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.305
For the risk of
not raising the money.

40:40.305 --> 40:41.906
Or counter, Dave.
Counter.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.175
You don't have to be insulted
with an offer like this.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.111
That valuation is a little low.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.315
Would you guys accept,
back to your offer,

40:50.315 --> 40:52.050
$300,000 for 20%?

40:52.050 --> 40:54.118
It's not enough
for the two of us.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.154
Yeah, it's not
enough for the two of us.
It's not enough
for the two of us.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.389
And I have over
20 million followers

40:58.389 --> 41:00.692
through all
my social platforms.
Right. Right.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.093
I mean, that alone

41:02.093 --> 41:05.863
is quite a lot of voices
to hear about this.
It is.

41:05.863 --> 41:09.267
Lori, have a look at
Grandfather O'Leary.

41:10.435 --> 41:12.270
He hates greed.

41:12.270 --> 41:14.038
You have to compromise.
What made him great ‐‐

41:14.038 --> 41:16.607
Well, what we were
saying is,

41:16.607 --> 41:18.710
you know, what if we're just
a third, right?

41:18.710 --> 41:21.913
So $300,000 for 33.3%.

41:21.913 --> 41:25.149
You literally cut his
valuation by 2/3.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.719
Don't be greedy.

41:27.719 --> 41:32.223
We're sticking at
$300,000 for 33.3%.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.762
You have a deal.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.064
Whoo!

41:40.064 --> 41:41.833
Congratulations.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.536
‐Oh, good job!
‐Thanks, bud.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.904
‐Thank you.
‐Great, great idea.

41:46.904 --> 41:48.106
Thank you so much,
Lori.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.173
Congratulations, Dave.

41:49.173 --> 41:50.074
Great job, Dave.

41:50.074 --> 41:53.011
Yeah, you can keep that.
Congrats.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.313
Thank you all.
Thank you.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.982
Dave, hey, take that
with you.
Thank you very much.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.820
Oh, my gosh.

42:02.820 --> 42:04.856
So I did give up more equity

42:04.856 --> 42:06.257
than I thought I would
coming in,

42:06.257 --> 42:08.593
but the odds of it
being massively successful

42:08.593 --> 42:09.594
are so high.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.995
I mean, it is amazing

42:10.995 --> 42:12.597
to work
with Robert and Lori,

42:12.597 --> 42:16.267
who are two just incredible
Sharks with the kindest hearts,

42:16.267 --> 42:18.202
and they just get
what we're trying to do.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.271
They understand
kind of the mission

42:20.271 --> 42:22.540
and the social impact
that we're trying to create.

42:22.540 --> 42:25.743
And now with them on the team,
it's gonna happen.
