09:56.822 --> 09:58.757

<b>And these kids had no idea</b>
<b>what was going on.</b>

10:09.768 --> 10:12.638

<b>These are people who</b>

<b>even through the night</b>
<b>for another shift.</b>

10:42.034 --> 10:43.936

10:50.943 --> 10:54.580
{\an1}<b>"If the kids aren't put</b>
<b>in their rooms, then</b>
<b>no one gets to go home!"</b>

10:54.613 --> 10:56.615

<b>In Brazil, when the</b>

<b>that your mother</b>
<b>has disappeared,</b>
<b>it means she's dead.</b>

11:15.801 --> 11:19.805
{\an1}<b>So I had to first calm him down</b>
<b>and say, "Your mom is alive."</b>

11:19.838 --> 11:21.407
<b>And then later on</b>
<b>in the evening,</b>

11:21.440 --> 11:23.409

11:27.046 --> 11:29.648
{\an3}<b>What? Sorry?</b>
<b>Why can't they hug?</b>

11:29.682 --> 11:33.352
<b>They have a facility-wide</b>
<b>no-touch policy.</b>

11:33.385 --> 11:36.221

11:36.255 --> 11:40.092
{\an1}<b>the little siblings grabbed</b>

11:40.125 --> 11:42.094

11:42.127 --> 11:44.163

{\an1}<b>What am I gonna say</b>

<b>And it's happening in the town</b>
<b>of Ruso, North Dakota.</b>

18:53.033 --> 18:57.404
{\an8}<b>North Dakota's oldest mayor</b>
<b>has breezed to another term,</b>

18:57.437 --> 19:01.041
{\an8}<b>winning unanimously in a vote</b>
<b>that saw 100% turnout.</b>

19:01.074 --> 19:05.546
<b>100 percent?! That seems</b>
<b>a little shady to me.</b>

19:05.579 --> 19:09.583
{\an1}<b>Only one other politician has</b>
<b>ever gotten 100% of the vote.</b>

19:09.616 --> 19:13.320
<b>This [bleep] guy.</b>

19:13.353 --> 19:15.489
{\an1}<b>We're all so worried about guys</b>

19:15.522 --> 19:18.058
<b>like Trump and Mike Pence</b>
<b>and Scott Pruitt,</b>

19:18.091 --> 19:21.829
<b>but the real dirt happens</b>
<b>on a local level.</b>

19:21.862 --> 19:25.432
<b>That's how you wind up</b>
<b>with a bloodthirsty tyrant</b>

19:25.465 --> 19:27.701
{\an1}<b>like Bruce Lorenz in office.</b>

19:27.734 --> 19:30.604
<b>"Ooh. Ooh.</b>

19:30.637 --> 19:32.940
<b>I'm an old man.</b>
<b>I...I..."</b>

19:32.973 --> 19:35.042
<b>Oh, it doesn't work with</b>
<b>this screen. Okay, great.</b>

19:35.075 --> 19:38.912
<b>Now...look at him.</b>

19:38.946 --> 19:42.049
<b>Sure, he's 86 years old</b>
<b>and uses a walker,</b>

19:42.082 --> 19:44.651
{\an1}<b>but this guy screams corruption.</b>

19:44.685 --> 19:46.553
<b>And if you don't think so,</b>
<b>ask yourself,</b>

19:46.587 --> 19:49.590
<b>how does one man</b>
<b>get 100% of the vote?</b>

19:49.623 --> 19:52.125
<b>Woman: Bruce Lorenz</b>
<b>captured all three votes cast</b>

19:52.159 --> 19:55.395
<b>in the state's smallest</b>
<b>incorporated city of Ruso.</b>

19:55.429 --> 19:57.931
<b>Three votes?!</b>

19:57.965 --> 20:00.968
<b>There are only three people</b>
<b>in the entire city!</b>

20:01.001 --> 20:03.737
<b>Their Tinder must be shit!</b>

20:03.770 --> 20:06.740
<b>You can just stick your head</b>
<b>out the window and go...</b>

20:06.773 --> 20:09.510
<b>"[Bleep] Joanne!</b>

20:09.543 --> 20:12.012
<b>Swipe right!"</b>

20:13.213 --> 20:14.481
<b>Three people.</b>

20:14.515 --> 20:16.717
<b>Actually, I think it's obvious</b>
<b>what's happening.</b>

20:16.750 --> 20:19.853
<b>This man is executing</b>
<b>his own people.</b>

20:19.887 --> 20:23.590
<b>To the people of Ruso,</b>
<b>you deserve to live free</b>

20:23.624 --> 20:26.226
<b>from the oppression</b>
<b>of a murderous dictator</b>

20:26.260 --> 20:31.265
<b>who eats dinner at 4:00</b>
<b>and is in bed by 7:30.</b>

20:31.298 --> 20:35.702
<b>It's time to end the tyranny</b>
<b>of an 86-year-old savage despot</b>

20:35.736 --> 20:38.005
<b>who runs the city</b>
<b>with an iron fist...</b>

20:38.038 --> 20:41.341
<b>and probably a steel plate</b>
<b>in his head</b>

20:41.375 --> 20:44.778
<b>and a couple of metal rods</b>
<b>in his back.</b>

20:44.811 --> 20:49.383
<b>We need to stop</b>
<b>this robot dictator!</b>

20:49.416 --> 20:51.785
<b>Now...</b>

20:51.819 --> 20:53.387
<b>we're off next week.</b>

20:53.420 --> 20:57.257
<b>We will see you again July 10th.</b>
<b>I'm Jim Jefferies.</b>

20:57.291 --> 21:00.027
<b>I think we can all do better.</b>
<b>Good night.</b>

21:00.060 --> 21:01.962
<b>[ Cheers and applause ]</b>

21:01.995 --> 21:08.669
