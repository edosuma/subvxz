01:57.220 --> 01:58.210
That's good!

01:59.380 --> 02:00.670
But the truth is...

02:00.670 --> 02:02.550
You are insane!

02:05.090 --> 02:06.080
....the truth is...

02:06.080 --> 02:09.080
-Oh, the truth is...
-The ever evasive truth...

02:09.080 --> 02:13.230
...is that there are advantages to losing all your stuff in a fire.

02:13.670 --> 02:14.310
How's that?

02:14.310 --> 02:16.180
To dying and coming back to life...

02:16.620 --> 02:18.130
No, no, no...I'm good, I'm good...

02:18.150 --> 02:19.850
Okay, all right... a little one...just a...

02:20.250 --> 02:21.970
Think about it... all the paper...

02:22.290 --> 02:25.320
Newspaper clippings from high school, yearbooks, and sweaters

02:25.520 --> 02:27.820
I was never gonna wear again, ever, and...

02:27.830 --> 02:29.600
pictures, and... picture frames...

02:30.960 --> 02:33.460
Yeah, but there's gotta be something that you had that...

02:33.460 --> 02:36.460
that it just kills you that you don't have anymore...

02:41.540 --> 02:43.720
I mean like a thing...like a thing, like...

02:44.240 --> 02:45.140
I know what you mean...

02:49.150 --> 02:52.080
I used to have a first edition Alice in Wonderland...

02:52.920 --> 02:55.030
my mother gave it to me for my 5th birthday...

02:55.820 --> 02:58.980
Despite my roller coaster relationship with her...

03:00.060 --> 03:01.810
wherever she is...

03:02.490 --> 03:06.300
that was one of the things I sort of loved...

03:11.020 --> 03:14.910
Okay, this is it. The bar is closing......

03:15.870 --> 03:23.520
last drink. The...elephant in the room...

03:24.000 --> 03:24.920
Which one?

03:25.120 --> 03:26.620
Aw, come on...tomorrow...

03:26.630 --> 03:28.490
you and Vaughn...working together...

03:28.520 --> 03:29.100
With Lauren...

03:29.110 --> 03:31.700
With Vaughn's wife, yes. And, let me just...

03:31.700 --> 03:34.090
say for the record that I'm gonna be your friend in there,

03:34.120 --> 03:36.930
and if you need someone to talk to, or if you need someone,

03:37.200 --> 03:38.800
like, a shoulder to cry on...

03:38.820 --> 03:40.210
I just want to be there for you.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.920
Oh, tomorrow's going to be fine.

03:43.370 --> 03:44.440
Damn it...

04:23.820 --> 04:25.040
You've met Lauren?

04:25.360 --> 04:25.930
Yes.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.660
Hello, again.

04:27.910 --> 04:29.010
Sorry again about yesterday.

04:29.010 --> 04:31.070
-I should have said something....
-No, it was my fault. You had no idea

04:31.070 --> 04:32.850
I was the one that stormed in…"

04:32.850 --> 04:33.500
Anyway…

04:33.520 --> 04:34.050
Sorry.

04:38.350 --> 04:40.960
Uh, listen, I made you a, um, mixed CD of all

04:41.030 --> 04:43.200
of the most popular songs over the past few years.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.500
Not so you can listen to all the impossible boy bands

04:45.630 --> 04:49.270
they keeps churning out with…except for J.T..Timberlake…

04:49.370 --> 04:53.040
that guy can move… whatever…But more importantly,

04:53.170 --> 04:55.170
because it’s scientifically proven that sounds trigger

04:55.270 --> 04:59.620
the CA3 region of the Hippocampus in the, you know…long-term memory.

04:59.820 --> 05:00.630
Thank you.

05:08.190 --> 05:09.040
Awkward!

05:11.390 --> 05:14.690
Earlier today, 4:47pm Moscow time,

05:15.690 --> 05:18.340
Russia’s early warning system was activated.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.090
They assumed it was an incoming missile attack.

05:21.230 --> 05:25.010
It wasn’t a missile. It was a satellite that had fallen from orbit.

05:25.270 --> 05:29.110
As a result of the perceived attack, the Russian president activated his nuclear briefcase,

05:29.140 --> 05:31.890
initiating a countdown to a prelaunch sequence.

05:31.980 --> 05:34.910
With two minutes to spare, they attained visual ID,

05:34.970 --> 05:37.550
and scrubbed the launch. Ten minutes later,

05:37.720 --> 05:41.750
Echelon picked up a call from a secure line between Sark and

05:41.850 --> 05:44.160
this man  Colonel Boris Oransky;

05:44.760 --> 05:49.050
dishonorably discharged in ’96 from Russia’s military space command.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.130
Since then, he’s worked for a privately held French contractor.

05:52.630 --> 05:54.000
It was their satellite.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.830
Oransky brought down his own satellite?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.100
Do we have any idea why?

05:57.130 --> 05:59.740
Not yet…but on the phone call,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.640
he and Sark discussed meeting to move on to ‘Phase Two’.

06:02.980 --> 06:05.240
We’ve tracked Sark to Mexico City.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.290
We’ve ordered a team of local agents to surveille him.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.720
If we’re gonna grab Sark, I’d like to be on that team.

06:10.980 --> 06:12.620
It isn’t our intention to grab Sark.

06:12.690 --> 06:15.290
The NSC believes we may learn more

06:15.350 --> 06:17.320
about the Covenant by tracking Sark’s movement

06:17.460 --> 06:19.930
in the hope he’ll lead us to the Covenant’s key players.

06:21.390 --> 06:23.160
That’s…fine in theory,

06:23.260 --> 06:25.660
except that I guarantee that within five minutes of that meeting,

06:25.800 --> 06:28.230
we will have lost Sark. It’s happened before.

06:28.570 --> 06:30.140
You know, within that last two years,

06:30.240 --> 06:33.110
our surveillance capabilities have become far more sophisticated.

06:33.170 --> 06:34.870
I may have missed a lot in the last two years…

06:35.010 --> 06:37.780
I mean, quite a bit…but the fact that Sark is already aligned

06:37.840 --> 06:40.550
with an organization outwardly hostile to the United States,

06:40.650 --> 06:42.310
and apparently Russia…indicates…

06:42.380 --> 06:43.480
As I was going to explain to you,

06:43.750 --> 06:46.620
our optical satellite resolution has increased dramatically.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.350
We have real-time face recognition…

06:48.490 --> 06:50.920
All the technology in the world can’t and won’t fix our problem.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.760
It’s the people we need to stop!

06:52.960 --> 06:56.430
Sark, for example Now, I’m familiar with the strategy you’re suggesting…

06:56.560 --> 06:59.200
the CIA employed it against SD-6, and I saw that…

06:59.300 --> 07:01.900
The risks you are describing have already been factored into our analysis.

07:02.030 --> 07:05.070
And as for SD-6…the Alliance doesn’t exist anymore…

07:05.200 --> 07:07.210
Well, the only reason that SD-6 and the Alliance broke down

07:07.310 --> 07:09.940
is because Arvin Sloane, a man the White House pardoned by the way,

07:10.080 --> 07:10.840
wanted them to!

07:11.080 --> 07:14.180
So, do me a favor, and don’t revise history that I lived through!

07:14.200 --> 07:14.950
All right, enough!

07:17.050 --> 07:19.520
Sark was an inch away from initiating a nuclear exchange…

07:19.690 --> 07:22.400
and that was only Phase One.

07:22.420 --> 07:24.520
Capturing Sark, while it might put a smile on my face,

07:24.540 --> 07:27.260
will do nothing to shut down the Covenant.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.290
For the moment, Sark remains free.

07:35.470 --> 07:36.990
Sydney, Weiss

07:36.990 --> 07:39.990
Sydney, Weiss… I want you to track Sark to that meeting with Oransky.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.470
Standard surveillance operation…

07:41.570 --> 07:44.680
let’s see if we can get some info on their “Phase Two”.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.450
You leave in an hour.

07:48.850 --> 07:50.070
I hate her!

07:50.120 --> 07:51.470
Just remember, she’s been through a lot.

07:51.550 --> 07:54.200
I’ve been on eggshells for two weeks since Sydney came back:

07:54.380 --> 07:55.640
trying not to say the wrong thing,

07:55.660 --> 07:57.660
trying to imagine what it’s like for her…I am done!

07:57.870 --> 08:00.390
Sydney Bristow is self-righteous and arrogant!

08:00.530 --> 08:01.960
She just lost two years of her life.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.250
Was she any nicer two years ago!?

08:03.260 --> 08:05.230
Because she’s the most condescending person I have ever met!

08:05.230 --> 08:06.530
I understand why you have a problem with her.

08:06.630 --> 08:08.200
No… she’s the one with the problem!

08:08.210 --> 08:11.200
I’m not going to apologize because I remember the last 24 months,

08:11.240 --> 08:12.940
or because I’m married to the man that I love!

08:12.970 --> 08:13.940
You’re reacting emotionally.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.650
No, I’m reacting intelligently, as I expected Sydney to.

08:16.710 --> 08:19.210
She’s been gone two years, you’d think she’d listen to someone

08:19.310 --> 08:21.660
instead of talking all over them! She’s horrible!

08:21.670 --> 08:24.950
Okay, stop.  This was Sydney’s first briefing.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.350
Give her a minute! I mean, the way things are,

08:27.420 --> 08:29.520
no one would blame you if the two of you hated each other…

08:29.690 --> 08:33.010
But I actually believe that you’ll end up respecting her…

08:33.740 --> 08:35.539
you might even like her.

08:43.169 --> 08:45.300
Just remember that I love you.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.580
How was the first briefing with Lauren?

08:51.590 --> 08:52.340
Wonderful.

08:52.410 --> 08:55.410
I’m not asking because I’m a fan of interoffice gossip; tell me how it went.

08:55.510 --> 08:56.520
Why?

08:56.530 --> 08:58.330
Did she seem aggressive toward you?

08:58.380 --> 09:01.750
Yes…as I’m sure I did to her. What is this about?

09:01.770 --> 09:02.940
In here

09:07.920 --> 09:10.450
Now that Lazarey’s murder has been linked to the Covenant,

09:10.450 --> 09:13.070
the NSC has convened their own investigation into his death.

09:13.070 --> 09:14.030
You don’t think they know?

09:14.070 --> 09:15.470
That you’re the murderer? Not yet.

09:16.270 --> 09:19.340
But they’ve just received some footage, apparently of the crime.

09:19.440 --> 09:20.050
How?

09:20.090 --> 09:22.510
Another camera…security, from across the street.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.240
And as our current bad luck would have it,

09:25.260 --> 09:28.250
the NSC’s assigned this investigation to Vaughn’s wife.

09:30.530 --> 09:31.800
I know what you’re thinking,

09:31.820 --> 09:33.890
but the longer we withhold this information from them,

09:33.900 --> 09:35.650
the more guilty I seem…

09:35.920 --> 09:39.260
The NSC and the CIA are going to learn that I killed Lazarey…

09:39.330 --> 09:41.830
…And when they do, the NSC will not hesitate

09:41.890 --> 09:45.400
to subject you to every available procedure in order to capture your memory…

09:45.500 --> 09:46.270
So let ‘em. Dad,

09:47.070 --> 09:49.670
I am losing my mind not knowing what happened to me,

09:49.770 --> 09:51.570
and if someone out there, someone has the answer…

09:51.870 --> 09:53.050
The techniques that would be employed

09:53.050 --> 09:55.100
to stimulate your memory are invasive surgical,

09:55.180 --> 09:58.510
dangerous procedures that could leave you with permanent brain damage.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.620
That is not happening to you; not as long as I’m alive.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.150
Sydney, we’ve discussed this.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.950
You need to stay focused; you have to do your job.

10:08.190 --> 10:12.890
Reintegrating into the CIA is the only way you’re going to get the answers you’re looking for.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.090
I’ve already talked with Lauren;

10:15.190 --> 10:17.160
I told her I might be able to help the investigation.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.830
She’s agreed to let me see the footage. You’ll go to Mexico City;

10:20.930 --> 10:24.690
I’ll do what I can to ensure this remains our secret.

11:01.110 --> 11:02.430
Marshall…any luck?

11:03.310 --> 11:04.540
Uh, yeah, actually…

11:05.360 --> 11:07.860
And considering it’s from a Russian security camera,

11:07.880 --> 11:11.620
you know I was expecting static, instead…it’s pretty good.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.380
Can you loop that?

11:28.580 --> 11:29.640
Freeze there.

11:29.950 --> 11:31.280
Blow up that frame, please.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.180
Not enough to make a positive ID, is it?

11:37.210 --> 11:38.130
Well, not like this.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.310
I’m not surprised that the Russians haven’t made a match.

11:40.410 --> 11:44.680
Their imaging programs generate pixel interpretation using Bayesian analysis.

11:45.340 --> 11:46.140
Really…

11:46.220 --> 11:47.020
Russians…

11:48.350 --> 11:49.460
You can do better?

11:49.560 --> 11:53.930
Me? Please…I, uh, there’s a lot of things I can’t do in life,

11:53.990 --> 11:56.660
you know, um…smoking a cigarette, uh, playing basketball,

11:56.760 --> 11:58.830
I never…oh, chin ups…I could never, uh,

11:58.930 --> 12:01.570
you know…there were always…kids laughing at me…but this?

12:02.230 --> 12:03.530
I was born for this.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.050
How long will it take you?

12:06.710 --> 12:10.740
These Eigin values are a mess…Give me 72 hours;

12:11.710 --> 12:13.010
I think I can ID this woman.

12:13.450 --> 12:14.680
Good. Thank you.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.240
I’m gonna kill Marshall. This is the worst disguise yet!

12:44.280 --> 12:47.050
Oh! Viva la revolution! I’m serious…look at that!

12:49.480 --> 12:52.950
Okay, uh… This chip has a gig of memory in it,

12:53.220 --> 12:55.120
or as they say here, la memoria.

12:55.450 --> 12:58.090
That’s enough memory to transmit full resolution photos.

13:00.180 --> 13:01.160
What’s this?

13:03.170 --> 13:05.500
Oh, okay, that’s bad…that’s double chin angle for me…

13:05.570 --> 13:06.380
Not good…

13:07.660 --> 13:08.770
Audio’s workin’.

13:09.070 --> 13:11.700
Syd, we’re here for surveillance only…nothing tricky.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.340
Here we go.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.100
Sark’s here.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.410
Oransky just got here.

14:00.390 --> 14:02.830
Retriever to base, I am uploading the photos…

14:09.300 --> 14:11.390
I need to move closer to get a look at those pictures.

14:11.430 --> 14:12.780
Don’t get too close.

14:18.170 --> 14:21.170
Be careful, Mountaineer. They most likely have backup.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.360
Well, it appears they’ve revealed themselves.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.290
As I told you they would.

14:37.390 --> 14:39.240
Codes are changed twice a week …

14:39.490 --> 14:41.530
These go into effect the day after tomorrow.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.040
This is our target, correct?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.370
Correct.

14:48.870 --> 14:50.890
By the way, I like the name…

14:51.150 --> 14:52.270
Medusa.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.270
It’s clever. The images are good, sir.

14:57.710 --> 15:00.510
Okay, we’ve got it, Mountaineer. Now, get out of there!

15:01.410 --> 15:03.100
That woman was watching us…

15:07.100 --> 15:08.490
Retriever, I think I’ve been made.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.600
Mountaineer, stay put. I’m comin’ in.

15:09.620 --> 15:10.460
Negative, Retriever.

15:10.570 --> 15:11.930
They’ve got your exits blocked;

15:12.000 --> 15:13.260
they’ll see you on the way in.

15:13.290 --> 15:14.930
If she’s CIA, we should be going.

15:14.990 --> 15:16.810
She might have seen the photos.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.000
Then I suggest you make sure she didn’t.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.470
Mountaineer, there’s a freight entrance at the back of the market,

15:23.570 --> 15:26.320
northeast corner. You should have a straight shot out.

15:30.240 --> 15:34.240
Get away! Get away! Hey! Gringo in the poncho!

15:35.350 --> 15:38.350
Senorita in the poncho! You know who you are!

15:38.880 --> 15:42.250
Reveal yourself or the girl dies!

15:42.580 --> 15:46.260
You’ve got five seconds! Four!

15:46.330 --> 15:50.140
Three! Two!

15:51.600 --> 15:54.430
Let her go…I’ll let you walk out of here.

15:54.530 --> 15:57.740
I’ll be giving the orders, thank you very much. Drop the gun.

15:59.370 --> 16:02.370
I said, drop it.

16:04.960 --> 16:06.610
Marshall, pull up her photos.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.600
-Shut up!
-Don’t hurt her!

16:14.750 --> 16:16.740
Senora! Senora, por favor!

16:21.390 --> 16:22.780
His earpiece is different that ours.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.180
Marshall, we need his RF signal now!

16:27.930 --> 16:31.340
Sydney, the mission in Thailand, Chai San…Get ready…

16:31.610 --> 16:32.580
I’ll tell you when.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.210
Marshall, what frequency are those guys transmitting on?

16:37.740 --> 16:39.690
Retriever, patch us through to the RF scanner…

16:39.710 --> 16:40.750
Kick it over.

16:45.850 --> 16:48.420
Okay…now…your surveillance equipment. Give it to me.

16:48.530 --> 16:49.920
Not until you let her go.

16:49.930 --> 16:50.890
No! No! No!

16:51.080 --> 16:52.490
Got it. 418.5 megahertz.

16:53.590 --> 16:54.670
Can you boost a feedback loop?

16:54.690 --> 16:55.510
How loud?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.330
180 dbs.

16:56.990 --> 16:57.780
Do it.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.670
Please…stop…trying to negotiate.

17:04.500 --> 17:05.869
The camera’s in my glasses.

17:06.869 --> 17:08.270
Give them to me.. Toss them to me.

17:11.980 --> 17:13.000
Now!

17:14.540 --> 17:15.500
Good.

17:19.849 --> 17:24.290
We’re gonna walk out of here…You, me…

17:24.819 --> 17:25.710
Almost there…

17:26.710 --> 17:27.849
…and the girl…

17:27.900 --> 17:28.569
Now!

17:49.560 --> 17:51.020
Oransky got away.

18:06.990 --> 18:09.470
So, Sark was looking at a satellite photo

18:09.600 --> 18:11.800
with a three mile radius centered around the Kremlin.

18:12.070 --> 18:12.910
We don’t know why.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.580
Yeah, but we know it has something to do with Medusa,

18:14.630 --> 18:15.870
whatever that means.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.190
When I was at SD-6,

18:17.190 --> 18:20.580
I think I heard Sloane mention something about a project called Medusa…

18:20.650 --> 18:22.580
You’re kidding me? You know what it is?

18:22.650 --> 18:23.930
What Medusa even means?

18:23.970 --> 18:25.380
No, all I know is the myth:

18:27.000 --> 18:29.820
a woman so ugly that if you looked at her, you’d turn to stone.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.460
Sounds like the myth of my college girlfriend.

18:34.460 --> 18:38.060
She actually dumped me for a roadie at a Duran Duran concert.

18:38.670 --> 18:40.400
How embarrassing is that?

18:41.430 --> 18:42.700
Oregano, please…

18:47.140 --> 18:50.580
Syd, come on, don’t do that…You weren’t dumped; you were dead!"

18:57.620 --> 18:59.890
I haven’t even asked anyone how they met…

19:01.990 --> 19:02.990
Are you asking me?

19:04.720 --> 19:07.830
The NSC was wrapping up the case on your mom

19:08.430 --> 19:11.630
we were all deposed…Lauren was the one asking the questions.

19:12.930 --> 19:13.900
They hit it off.

19:16.770 --> 19:18.000
Tell me about their wedding…

19:19.640 --> 19:23.370
It was fine…Her parents’ farm in Virginia…

19:23.390 --> 19:25.400
You know, she’s Senator Reed’s daughter, so…

19:25.470 --> 19:26.780
No, I didn’t.

19:27.410 --> 19:31.080
Yeah. They have like, 900 acres…it’s pretty crazy.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.620
Was everyone there? Dixon? Marshall?…

19:37.590 --> 19:43.230
Syd…She’s a good person.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.300
I’m not trying to rub it in, but...

19:46.870 --> 19:49.470
I…I don’t want to be dishonest.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.510
I should’ve thought of it before…

19:54.770 --> 19:55.910
I mean, come on, isn’t it obvious?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.760
A prior image model with 3D surface reconstruction.

19:58.790 --> 19:59.740
I don’t know what I was thinking…

19:59.750 --> 20:01.450
Have you made a positive identification or not?

20:01.470 --> 20:04.080
Well, no, not yet. Now, this…is where we started…

20:04.980 --> 20:09.510
Okay, now after an application of my 3D reconstruction genius…

20:09.510 --> 20:11.340
this is where we are now…

20:14.620 --> 20:15.820
How’s it going?

20:16.140 --> 20:17.630
Marshall’s ahead of schedule.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.370
When do you think you’ll be finished?

20:19.730 --> 20:23.400
Oh, I don’t know, I’d say what…maybe, uh, noon tomorrow?

20:25.270 --> 20:27.110
Good. Thank you.

20:27.610 --> 20:31.110
I’d like to feed the image into our face recognition database as soon as its complete.

20:41.690 --> 20:46.790
Sydney was right. The Medusa project was flagged in the SD-6 database.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.460
It’s an anti-satellite pulse weapon.  Once operational,

20:50.630 --> 20:54.130
it can cripple our network of satellites, DOD, NSA, you name it.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.280
We’d be blind to a potential attack.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.640
You see, that’s what’s so genius about this weapon…

20:58.740 --> 21:01.470
It beams a microwave at one satellite in the chain,

21:01.610 --> 21:03.590
which then relays a pulse across the entire network.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.620
You’re talking about hundreds of satellites…

21:05.620 --> 21:07.540
most with classified orbital rotations…

21:07.540 --> 21:09.300
How does this tie in with the Covenant?

21:09.350 --> 21:10.480
The man Sark met with…

21:10.550 --> 21:11.460
Oransky.

21:11.990 --> 21:14.790
He supervised the development of Medusa for the Russian military;

21:14.890 --> 21:16.890
only he was discharged before it was completed.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.620
He never knew where it ended up. Until now.

21:20.650 --> 21:23.160
This is the satellite photo Sark and Oransky were looking at.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.400
According to the time stamp, it was taken by a satellite

21:26.470 --> 21:31.540
exactly four minutes after Oransky sent that other satellite of his crashing into Gorky Park.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.910
Hmmm. He sends one bird down so the other

21:34.010 --> 21:36.640
can photograph Russia’s nuclear reaction protocol in action.

21:37.110 --> 21:40.330
See, what happened was, they thought they were under attack

21:40.370 --> 21:44.120
so among other things, they evacuated several high-level government officials

21:44.280 --> 21:48.520
to several continuity of government bunkers designed to survive a nuclear attack.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.520
This is what Medusa photographed.

21:50.550 --> 21:52.590
See these motorcades entering the Science Ministry?

21:52.790 --> 21:55.630
here must be a bunker underneath.

21:56.000 --> 21:59.530
According to the SD-6 database, Medusa is stored in that bunker.

21:59.630 --> 22:02.200
And now Oransky and Sark are planning to steal it.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.240
Just a shot in the dark but,

22:03.300 --> 22:04.880
why don’t we call the Kremlin and let ‘em know what’s up?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.870
The Russians claim to oppose anti-satellite weapons.

22:07.010 --> 22:09.280
They’re not about to admit having one.

22:09.510 --> 22:14.270
Bottom line…we have to access the bunker and steal it before Sark gets it.

22:15.050 --> 22:17.220
I’ll have Strategic Services list our options.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.290
Meet back here in one hour.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.720
No problem; I can corrupt that image,

22:21.890 --> 22:26.060
but the terms of my parole prohibit me from using a computer.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.790
You should know that, Jack, I believe you wrote them…"

22:34.530 --> 22:35.480
How’s it rendered?

22:35.530 --> 22:36.740
3D surface reconstruction.

22:37.140 --> 22:38.140
Is the workstation part of a network?

22:38.240 --> 22:38.670
Yes.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.630
Okay, well…give me a few days…

22:41.650 --> 22:42.520
I’ll see what I can cook up.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.850
I need it by noon, tomorrow.

22:45.910 --> 22:48.210
I have an IQ of 170, Jack…I’m not David Copperfield.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.020
I’ll do what I can.

22:53.190 --> 22:54.320
We have to do better than this.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.290
An hour running scenarios and the best we can come up with is Sloane!

22:58.310 --> 22:59.490
Well, through his cancer research,

22:59.490 --> 23:01.750
Sloane has developed a relationship with the Science Ministry.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.060
If we can get into the Ministry,

23:03.160 --> 23:06.870
we can access the bunker and destroy Medusa before Sark and Oransky can steal it.

23:06.970 --> 23:09.500
I don’t want to be the voice of dissent every time I walk into this room.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.210
I know we’re all qualified to make decisions here, but to me…

23:13.470 --> 23:14.870
Sloane is still a criminal.

23:14.970 --> 23:17.240
As we’ve discussed, Sloane is a necessary evil.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.580
We need access to the bunker;

23:18.680 --> 23:20.750
Sloane can get it for us…if we can use him,

23:20.810 --> 23:21.650
I don’t see why we…

23:21.670 --> 23:22.720
Maybe you haven’t been lucky enough

23:22.820 --> 23:25.020
to have first-hand experience with that…psychopath…

23:25.150 --> 23:25.990
She brokered his deal.

23:26.350 --> 23:26.950
What!?

23:27.050 --> 23:29.120
I was part of the team that arranged for Sloane’s pardon.

23:29.660 --> 23:31.990
Look, none of us are any illusions about Sloane.

23:32.090 --> 23:34.090
The only reason he was given a pardon is because he provided us

23:34.160 --> 23:36.960
with intel that led to the destruction of terrorist cells…

23:37.100 --> 23:40.030
Of course he did! He used you to wipe out his competition.

23:40.130 --> 23:43.640
Let me guess…so far his intelligence has been accurate…

23:43.700 --> 23:47.670
Yes…and the first slip he makes, his pardon will be revoked.

23:47.740 --> 23:49.740
When is your next scheduled briefing with Sloane?

23:49.810 --> 23:50.680
You have regular meetings with him!?

23:50.750 --> 23:51.850
Sydney…

23:52.180 --> 23:53.080
Twelve days.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.480
All right. Move it up. See if Sloane can get us access to the Science Ministry.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.780
I want both of you to go in as well.

23:59.390 --> 24:01.690
if Sloane can help us infiltrate the bunker,

24:01.690 --> 24:02.840
I don’t want to waste a minute…

24:02.890 --> 24:04.460
is that clear?

24:19.350 --> 24:20.460
Do you mind?

24:21.840 --> 24:22.840
Of course not.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.390
This is a difficult situation for all of us.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.860
I thought…I’m not sure how exactly,

24:36.990 --> 24:39.660
but I thought we should at least acknowledge that.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.330
No one would blame us if we hated each other…

24:48.830 --> 24:50.270
but I hope that doesn’t happen.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.530
I don’t hate you

24:58.210 --> 24:59.520
or Vaughn.

25:03.720 --> 25:06.190
That’s what makes it so difficult.

25:08.050 --> 25:10.020
We just got intel from NSA.

25:10.590 --> 25:12.270
They tracked Sark onto a plane from Berlin,

25:12.320 --> 25:14.760
headed to Frankfurt, only when it landed, he wasn’t on board.

25:17.330 --> 25:19.300
Which means, if Sloane doesn’t help us today,

25:19.700 --> 25:22.400
Sark will get to Medusa before we do.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.200
I’m sorry.

25:25.170 --> 25:26.370
I can’t help you.

25:26.870 --> 25:28.870
You work with the Science Ministry all the time.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.110
How difficult is it for you to add the names of

25:31.210 --> 25:33.910
two of your employees to the guest list of an awards banquet?

25:33.980 --> 25:35.580
Actually, it’s not difficult at all.

25:35.880 --> 25:40.690
It’s what you plan to do once you’re inside the Ministry that concerns me.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.690
We made it clear that topic is not open to discussion.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.260
Pursuant to my pardon agreement,

25:45.390 --> 25:48.360
I am under obligation to pass along intel as appropriate.

25:48.460 --> 25:53.400
However, I am under no obligation to assist you, or anyone else, to break the law.

25:55.370 --> 26:01.340
Now, as you know, millions of people rely on relief that this company provides.

26:03.740 --> 26:09.180
I couldn’t possibly endanger that by exposing Omnifam, or myself, to criminal charges..

26:11.060 --> 26:12.820
Certainly not with my history…

26:13.450 --> 26:17.120
You’ve made your obligations clear; now let me clarify mine…

26:17.620 --> 26:21.860
I am obliged to extract immeasurable pain from you the moment

26:21.960 --> 26:25.200
you are no longer a valuable source of intel for the CIA.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.130
Personally, I hope you don’t help us out…

26:30.170 --> 26:33.870
I’ve missed you, Sydney. I really have.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.580
Well, it shouldn’t be too difficult.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.480
I’ll simply tell the Ministry that you’re high-level donors and you’re looking for a new investment.

26:41.750 --> 26:42.750
You know where to contact us.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.850
I’ll expect to hear from you within the hour.

26:45.990 --> 26:50.620
Mr. Vaughn…You know, I remember how close you were with Sydney.

26:52.060 --> 26:54.430
I’m sure you share my relief in having her back…

26:57.130 --> 26:58.830
Just get us on the list.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.190
Are we on the list?

27:23.220 --> 27:26.860
Under the names Tomas Quintera and Sabina Milan, Omnifam investors.

27:26.910 --> 27:27.560
Got it.

27:29.010 --> 27:29.790
Here.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.000
What?

27:37.700 --> 27:39.460
I was just thinking of that party…

27:39.670 --> 27:41.190
at the embassy in Prague…

27:41.610 --> 27:42.850
God, that was a good third date…

27:42.940 --> 27:46.910
Yeah, it was…When you spilled your drink on the ambassador?

27:46.980 --> 27:48.110
What was I supposed to do?

27:48.210 --> 27:49.780
He was staring down your dress all night long…

27:56.760 --> 27:57.890
Look how handsome you are…

28:06.770 --> 28:07.470
Ready.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.140
Be safe.

28:11.700 --> 28:12.550
You too.

28:18.980 --> 28:20.750
Dixon’s expecting a call from me.

28:20.850 --> 28:22.250
I’ll see you in Los Angeles.

28:36.660 --> 28:38.130
It’s a polymorphic worm.

28:38.530 --> 28:39.830
Upload it onto the network;

28:39.930 --> 28:41.870
it singles out the files you’re interested in

28:41.930 --> 28:44.770
and corrupts the data so the image can’t be fully rendered.

28:45.400 --> 28:46.540
I know, you can kiss me.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.630
How long will that take?

28:47.710 --> 28:49.910
I…can’t say…it depends on the size of the network.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.580
There is one catch. When you make the upload,

28:54.680 --> 28:57.150
it has to be at a terminal with administrative privileges.

29:13.430 --> 29:16.700
Minister, Tomas Quintera and Sabina Milan.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.970
Arvin Sloane sends his regards.

29:20.370 --> 29:22.510
Mr. Sloane is an amazing man.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.110
And a great friend of science. Welcome.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.350
Good evening.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.620
Good evening.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.090
‘Arvin Sloane is an amazing man’!?

29:38.360 --> 29:38.920
Sydney…

29:43.330 --> 29:44.360
The guards are about to change shifts;

29:44.730 --> 29:45.830
we have about a minute left.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.960
The guards are gone.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.880
Let’s do it.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.810
I’ve got the minister’s prints…

31:08.850 --> 31:10.250
The thumb’s the clearest.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.590
After you.

31:37.840 --> 31:41.450
The NSC’s on a real time hookup, so whatever we see, Lindsay sees.

31:41.940 --> 31:43.480
And the face recognition database?

31:43.620 --> 31:44.420
Ready to kick in…

31:44.680 --> 31:46.970
As soon as I get the image rendered, we’re ready to roll.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.830
Mr. Bristow…What can I do for you?

31:55.860 --> 31:56.860
Is Director Dixon in?

31:56.890 --> 31:58.330
No…he’s over with Marshall.

31:58.430 --> 31:59.730
Is there something I can help you with?

31:59.830 --> 32:01.460
No, thanks. I’ll just drop these off on his desk .

32:01.510 --> 32:02.330
Okay.

32:58.700 --> 33:01.160
Okay, lets see how many guards are on the floor.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.970
We’re almost into their video surveillance feed.

33:08.300 --> 33:09.360
What?

33:10.970 --> 33:12.870
These are the cameras for the control room level…

33:14.010 --> 33:15.570
Sark must already be here.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.980
Oh God…He’s with Oransky.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.920
Come on.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.970
Wait a minute…we have no idea how many men Sark brought with him.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.520
Yeah…and he doesn’t know we’re coming…

33:55.490 --> 33:57.380
The program will be ready to render in a minute.

33:58.220 --> 34:01.860
Uh…I was curious…Lindsay briefs the President, right?

34:02.970 --> 34:04.000
You think maybe… you know,

34:04.100 --> 34:06.740
assuming this all goes well…that he could,

34:07.190 --> 34:10.440
uh, request one of those White House tie clips for me?

34:10.540 --> 34:12.760
Or uh, peanuts from Air Force One…because I…

34:12.770 --> 34:16.540
love peanuts…and you figure they’d get top quality…

34:17.040 --> 34:18.880
being as you’re…um…the President.

34:19.179 --> 34:20.550
Oh, here we go.

34:32.889 --> 34:35.060
Until Mr. Oransky gets the Medusa core,

34:35.159 --> 34:39.030
no one enters the control room and this entire level should be locked down.

34:39.670 --> 34:42.679
I need you to secure all the access points with…

35:09.450 --> 35:10.760
Oh, uh, gummybear?

35:17.720 --> 35:19.170
Find everything you need?

35:19.180 --> 35:21.010
Yes, thanks. I’m just leaving him a note.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.380
I was wondering if you might show up.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.030
I looked for you upstairs at the party.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.640
I’ve taken the liberty of discontinuing the elevator service.

35:50.340 --> 35:54.310
And unfortunately, Mr. Oransky, Medusa, and myself won’t be here

35:54.440 --> 35:57.010
when the guards arrive, but I’m certain when they discover you

35:57.140 --> 35:59.650
the Russians will be more than hospitable hosts…

36:08.520 --> 36:09.620
I think we got it.

36:12.410 --> 36:14.170
There’s no way we can steal Medusa.

36:14.170 --> 36:17.610
We can’t let Sark get it, either. We’ll have to destroy it….

36:19.220 --> 36:21.140
We could still rig the generator to blow.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.200
We do that, this whole sublevel’s going with it,

36:23.200 --> 36:24.490
we won’t have a way out.

36:24.890 --> 36:26.170
That could be an intake vent.

36:26.170 --> 36:27.710
We could crawl inside and get out.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.050
We might not make it…

36:31.640 --> 36:32.770
We might make it.

36:35.710 --> 36:37.230
I’ll activate the transfer switch.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.750
We’ll have the Medusa core in 30 seconds…

36:48.750 --> 36:50.030
What the hell was that!?

36:51.600 --> 36:54.830
That generator powers the contol system…

36:55.100 --> 36:58.140
they’ve overloaded the voltage

36:58.550 --> 37:00.230
Medusa is fried.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.360
We have to go.

37:05.940 --> 37:10.750
No way. This bitch…shot me in my leg…

37:28.620 --> 37:29.730
What’s happening?

37:29.800 --> 37:30.780
I’m not sure…

37:31.870 --> 37:33.240
It’s not rendering…

37:33.240 --> 37:36.240
According to the program…this is as good as it gets

38:06.830 --> 38:08.100
Anything yet?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.040
Not what we hoped.

38:10.210 --> 38:12.780
On the picture side…not on the technical side…

38:12.840 --> 38:14.310
the picture’s not in…focus…

38:14.410 --> 38:16.320
So, no positive identification of Lazarey’s killer?

38:16.420 --> 38:17.380
Unfortunately, no.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.750
Too bad.  We’ll keep looking.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.720
Officially, the Kremlin denies having possession of Medusa…

38:59.060 --> 39:02.590
Unofficially, they’ve confirmed that Medusa was destroyed.

39:02.980 --> 39:03.850
Good work.

39:04.090 --> 39:04.760
Thank you.

39:04.790 --> 39:06.230
Go home. Get some rest.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.470
I’ll see you tomorrow.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.270
Good night.

39:29.670 --> 39:31.210
I took care of it.

39:33.390 --> 39:34.430
Thanks, Dad.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.700
Welcome back.

40:00.810 --> 40:02.140
It’s a third edition…

40:08.350 --> 40:09.410
Thank you.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.410
I was going to get the first edition…

40:12.410 --> 40:15.410
but it was, like, 40 thousand dollars…

40:22.430 --> 40:24.000
Anyway…I’ll see ya later.
