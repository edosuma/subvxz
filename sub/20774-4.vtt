-What?
-Be more conversational.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.228
I'm being conversational.
You told me to answer only questions,

14:56.312 --> 14:58.439
-no statements--
-No, no. Easy-breezy, kiddo.

-Yes or no. She didn't ask a question.
-Did you almost die that night?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.487
Yes. Thank you for asking.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.240
I was almost killed that night.
Are we good?

-Easy-breezy.
-Stop saying "easy-breezy", man.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.828
You suffered a massive trauma.

You were shot twice,
you lost a lot of blood.

I'm glad you could be with us here today.

15:18.959 --> 15:19.793
Thank you so much.

15:19.877 --> 15:23.672
You're welcome. We have it on record
that after your recent car crash,

15:23.756 --> 15:27.468
you told the police that you were not
under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.094
-Were you there?
-Yes.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.179
-[man] Is that what happened?
-Yes, but--

15:30.262 --> 15:32.973
Come on, now. Your blood test
proved otherwise, didn't it?

15:33.307 --> 15:34.934
So, I'd have to say you were lying.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.437
Okay, so, that was months ago,
before I got sober.

15:38.520 --> 15:43.108
I'm sorry. I'll ask that as a question
since I know it'll make you happier.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.443
Do you still lie?

[cell phone ringing]

15:46.779 --> 15:48.989

Mr. Rayburn, are you still going to AA?

15:53.577 --> 15:54.495
-Good Lord.
-[man] Kevin.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.580
-What?
-Don't let her get under your skin.

Listen, this is my wife,
I gotta get home for my baby's feeding.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.544
Kevin, I think it's a good idea
for you to do some reading.

cross-examination.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.675
Is she fucking kidding me?

16:07.758 --> 16:10.803
I-- I know it's a lot,
but I want you to take that home.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.054
I want you to study it

16:12.137 --> 16:15.516
so when you're on that stand,
it'll be like you've known him for years.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.477
When, in the next two weeks,
am I supposed to learn this?

16:18.560 --> 16:21.313
I didn't go to school like you guys.
I suck at studying.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.731
Try.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.778
Yeah, I'll be godfather, but--? What--?

16:29.196 --> 16:31.490
What exactly does godfather entail?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.617

what you're supposed to do.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.252
Wanted to ask her
to stand up as godmother.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.879
Listen to me,
don't talk to Mom about Meg right now.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.966
-She's got enough to worry about.
-Okay. I'm just asking, John.

16:49.049 --> 16:52.594
Did you recommend
that Eric get out for the funeral?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.471
Yeah. Yeah. I wrote a letter.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.598
You know, it can help us.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.393
No, Kevin, that's not how it works.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.312
The jury can't have prior information
about the damn trial,

17:02.396 --> 17:04.481
otherwise they wouldn't be selected
as a jury.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.775
Whose idea was it?
You didn't write that letter.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.152
What does that matter, John?

17:08.235 --> 17:10.571
Yes, Roy asked me to write the letter.
So, what?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.531
Fuck him.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.700
Hey, man, can you back off, please?

17:14.783 --> 17:16.952
Roy's saying
there's not even gonna be a trial.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.954
Yeah, Kevin, I'll see you at the party.

what they ask for.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.241
Is Kevin here?

17:57.034 --> 17:59.912
Uh, no. He's off at the prosecutor's
preparing for the trial.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.332
You're asking Kevin to support Eric
getting out for his mother's funeral.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
That's a good humanitarian gesture.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.087
I contribute to many causes.

18:08.170 --> 18:12.883
Time spent managing how you're perceived
in the public eye is never wasted.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.385
And you're telling Kevin
that Eric won't go to trial.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.846
-How is it you know that?
-[chuckles] Relax, John.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.224
No, really. How is it that you know that?

18:20.307 --> 18:21.683
I'm on your side, John.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.728
Any update on Ozzy Delveccio?

18:25.437 --> 18:28.899
I told you, he was arrested in Miami
a couple months ago for stealing cars.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.317
Take another look.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.695
I-- I think it became a misdemeanor.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.156
He could be getting out soon. Let me know.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.661
You need a little faith, John.

Yeah, listen, um, we're gonna have
the baby christened on Sunday.

19:19.116 --> 19:22.286
Yeah. I guess he will be the first one
in the family.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.248
We were wondering
if we could have the party at the inn.

19:30.502 --> 19:33.964
Yeah, Mother, I know he's just a baby,
but, you know, he's my only--

19:36.258 --> 19:38.594
Okay, it's not just about the baby.
You know? Um...

19:38.719 --> 19:40.679

Mom?

to take the power of a carbon fiber hull,

20:08.790 --> 20:10.584

20:10.667 --> 20:12.628
Not tonight, not next week, not never.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.130

that's what we're gonna do. All right?

on this boat is not gonna--

You don't think that shit?

on a boat like that.

you've helped bail him out before.

You wanna talk about that?

No. I wanted to talk about Ozzy.

You first came here looking for your
older brother, wondering where he was.

more than anyone else from back home,

from the Keys, so I helped you,

that he was killed.

for his dad's death.

that Danny had no other choice

and ask all of you for help.

29:43.531 --> 29:44.532
How's it going, Jake?

29:45.992 --> 29:48.161
-You really wanna know?
-Absolutely not.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.213
Yeah?

29:58.588 --> 29:59.672
Hey. You got a minute?

30:02.759 --> 30:03.593
Yeah.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.392
So, that pissing match back there
between you and the boss,

30:12.060 --> 30:13.102
that about him or me?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.479
[breathes deeply]

30:14.562 --> 30:16.356
That's about him, 100%.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.900
So, you guys are just gonna be assholes
from now on?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.653
Or you gonna grow up,
put the sheriff's race behind you?

30:22.445 --> 30:24.280
-What?
-Yeah, you're better off anyway.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.033
-You didn't really wanna be sheriff.
-And why is that?

30:27.617 --> 30:29.786
Because next election,
you'd have to lose to me.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.539
Can I ask you a question?

30:34.541 --> 30:36.960
You are a little crazy, right?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.463
Well, I would be if I answered that.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.396
[Chelsea] Hi, John.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.235
I'm really sorry about your mom.

31:02.819 --> 31:05.238
Well, she hated being alive.
She was done years ago.

31:08.491 --> 31:10.827
The sheriff and lawyers
are being real assholes.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.955
Eric should be at the funeral.
You know that, right?

31:18.167 --> 31:21.129
Listen, there's a lot of reasons
why he's locked up, Chelsea.

31:22.422 --> 31:25.675
People hate our family more than ever.
I never took you for a hater.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.386
Listen, I'm not a hate--
I've never hated your family.

31:28.469 --> 31:29.304
Then help us.

31:30.305 --> 31:31.347
And speak for us.

31:33.516 --> 31:34.475
Speak for us.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.185
Your words mean a lot.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.355
Miss O'Bannon. Ready to come with me?

31:40.356 --> 31:42.317
You're welcome to the funeral if you want.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.902
You're up next, Detective.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.590
[sighs]

32:14.223 --> 32:15.350
Roy Gilbert.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.269
What about him?

32:19.604 --> 32:22.649
He got Kevin somehow to sign
a piece of paper for the O'Bannons.

32:22.732 --> 32:24.943
Oh, I know. He asked me, too. I said no.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.947
He then told me that he was doing it
because he wanted to help.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.031
Help?

32:31.199 --> 32:35.662
Oh, God. Some people would say
Roy Gilbert is a dangerous enemy.

32:36.704 --> 32:39.749
I say he's an equally dangerous friend.

32:40.333 --> 32:41.960
If he wants to help you,

32:43.252 --> 32:44.504
he'll go to any length.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.630
How's that?

32:50.635 --> 32:51.511
All right.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.471
I don't know. Maybe--

32:54.555 --> 32:56.849
Maybe a party's exactly what we need.

32:58.309 --> 33:01.229
[sighs] I really miss your sister.

33:02.772 --> 33:04.857
You know, once this trial is over,

33:06.192 --> 33:08.111
I'm sure Meg will be in touch.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.538
Well, I hope it's over soon, then.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.332
[phone ringing]

33:22.250 --> 33:23.292
[phone beeps]

33:23.376 --> 33:24.961
Rayburn House. How may I help--?

33:27.547 --> 33:30.341
No, it's not good news, Roy.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.719
John and I disagree with you.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.556
[chuckles]
No, I'm not shooting the messenger.

33:37.181 --> 33:38.808
This is what you wanted, Roy.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.768
Not us. You.

33:41.561 --> 33:42.812
-[phone beeps]
-[Sally scoffs]

33:43.730 --> 33:44.856
Eric's getting out.

33:48.067 --> 33:52.113
John, that's out of our hands now.

33:53.114 --> 33:54.949
I'm not gonna let Gilbert do this.

34:02.749 --> 34:03.916
I'll see you tomorrow.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.293
God willing.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.826
[cell phone ringing]

34:42.622 --> 34:43.456
Hey, John.

34:44.540 --> 34:45.750
No, it's okay. I'm up.

34:47.627 --> 34:48.878
What, right now?

34:50.505 --> 34:51.339
Um...

34:52.173 --> 34:53.591
Yeah, okay. Where are you?

35:05.269 --> 35:06.104
Hey, brother.

35:08.981 --> 35:11.150
What's going on? You okay?

35:14.070 --> 35:15.238
What?

35:16.489 --> 35:18.157
I wanted to let you know
as soon as I heard

35:18.241 --> 35:19.492
that the prosecutors called

35:19.575 --> 35:22.203
and Eric O'Bannon gets to go
to the funeral tomorrow.

35:25.748 --> 35:26.582
Okay.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.044
You don't have to make
a federal case out of it.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.838
-Do you know what you're doing?
-Yeah.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.881
I'm trying to have a party for my son.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.092
Roy Gilbert. Do you know who he is?

35:36.175 --> 35:37.552
Yeah, I do know who he is.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.763
Yeah, he's the guy that saved our asses.
More than once.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.557
He financed your whole campaign,

35:42.640 --> 35:45.351
and you didn't have any problem
with that a few months ago.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.186
He's saving my business.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.272
Roy's the reason that my life is--

35:49.355 --> 35:52.608
Is pretty much
the best it's ever really been, John.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.698
John, I'm just trying
to protect my family.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.242
That and throw a fucking party.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.786
Yeah, throw a fucking party.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.164
Why not, John?

36:06.247 --> 36:08.291
I mean, for fuck's sake, come on.

36:10.710 --> 36:11.544
[sighs]

36:12.753 --> 36:15.298
Everything that's happened, everything?

36:15.590 --> 36:19.051
Why do you think that happened, huh?
Have you ever asked yourself that?

36:19.594 --> 36:21.846
It happened so we could live our lives.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.268
What was the point if we don't live them?

36:31.814 --> 36:34.025
It's like what we say
in the meetings, you know?

36:34.108 --> 36:38.905
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things that I cannot change.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.573
You could've changed this.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.159
Change what? What exactly?

36:43.743 --> 36:45.912
He's a guy,
he's gonna go to his mom's funeral.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.414
That's all, dude. Really.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.752
The rest of it is going on
inside your head.

36:53.377 --> 36:57.423
Take a step back, get some perspective,
get your mind right.

36:58.674 --> 36:59.717
Like you?

36:59.800 --> 37:00.760
Maybe.

37:05.097 --> 37:07.391
Yeah, maybe. Why the fuck not like me?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.812
I'm sick of you looking down
on me my whole life.

37:15.107 --> 37:15.942
Okay?

37:17.944 --> 37:20.446
You remember that word
Dad used to use all the time?

37:23.157 --> 37:24.200
Disappointment.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.995
Why are you so upset about this?

37:29.247 --> 37:32.458
You know what happens when you ask
a guy like Roy Gilbert to help you?

37:33.668 --> 37:35.169
People get shot, don't they?

37:36.796 --> 37:37.672
Well, I mean...

37:40.800 --> 37:42.468
Do you think that's such a bad idea?

37:45.179 --> 37:46.305
Get out of my car.

37:51.394 --> 37:52.561
[yelling] Get out of my car!

37:56.148 --> 37:56.983
Okay.

38:25.678 --> 38:27.054
Ah.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.859
Eric should be at her funeral.
You know that, right?

38:41.110 --> 38:42.528
You need a little faith, John.

38:42.611 --> 38:43.946
I'm on your side.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.489
[knocking on door]

39:12.266 --> 39:13.100
Who is it?

39:15.770 --> 39:16.604
Who is it?

39:20.649 --> 39:21.650
[Diana] It's me.

39:34.955 --> 39:36.916
I've had too much to drink.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.335
Did you drive here?

39:40.753 --> 39:41.962
No, I caught a cab.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.301
I don't think the kids
should see me like this.

39:53.682 --> 39:54.517
Get in here.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.394
[chuckling] You're so serious!

39:56.477 --> 39:57.395
Get in here.

40:00.773 --> 40:01.899
[softly] I love you.

40:02.733 --> 40:04.235
-Come on.
-Thank you.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.405
Come on.

40:09.865 --> 40:13.744
Thank you for always coming over
every single time I call,

40:13.828 --> 40:17.123
and never making a fool out of me
when I make excuses to get you there,

40:17.206 --> 40:18.499
because I know you know.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.007
[baby cooing]

40:41.355 --> 40:42.565
[laughing]

40:44.066 --> 40:44.900
Wow.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.031
I'm so lost.

40:53.409 --> 40:54.410
Take the bed.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.209
[Diana groaning]

41:09.717 --> 41:10.718
Oh, God.

41:13.471 --> 41:14.305
I...

[cell phone ringing]

41:54.094 --> 41:54.929
Janey.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.267
No, don't worry about it. I've got her.

42:00.893 --> 42:03.020
No, honey, I have her.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.774
I know you do.

42:08.734 --> 42:10.694
No, no, she's gonna be back
in the morning.

42:12.154 --> 42:16.075
Get a good night's sleep,
and you and I will talk tomorrow, okay?

42:17.201 --> 42:18.410
All right. Good night.

42:42.935 --> 42:46.814
Mama may have, Papa--

42:47.606 --> 42:49.108
Papa may have...

42:52.319 --> 42:54.989
God bless the boy that's got his own.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.910
That's got his own...

43:15.509 --> 43:16.468
[phone ringing]

43:24.518 --> 43:26.645
Hello, Rayburn House. How may I help you?

43:28.606 --> 43:29.440
Hello?

43:34.111 --> 43:34.945
Meg?

43:36.280 --> 43:37.114
Honey?

43:39.491 --> 43:40.492
Is that you?

43:44.038 --> 43:46.373
If this isn't my daughter Meg,
please hang up.

43:49.793 --> 43:50.628
Oh, Meg.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.423
Oh. Honey, are you all right?

43:54.715 --> 43:55.633
Oh, no, no.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.886
I'm sorry. I won't ask questions.
I should know better.

43:59.428 --> 44:02.222
I'm feeling kind of foolish
if this isn't you,

44:02.306 --> 44:04.808
if this is just dead air.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.562
I'm making a complete fool of myself.

44:11.357 --> 44:12.191
Oh, Meg.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.277
I love you, Meg.

44:16.987 --> 44:17.905
That's all.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.407
I love you.

44:21.742 --> 44:22.743
And I miss you.

44:26.246 --> 44:27.706
You don't have to say anything.

44:28.207 --> 44:29.583
Just let me talk, okay?

44:30.584 --> 44:35.673
No need to answer, just--
No questions, no answers, just--

44:37.549 --> 44:38.592
Just be with me.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.679
Don't hang up, please.

44:43.097 --> 44:43.931
Don't hang up.

45:20.634 --> 45:21.635
Hey.

45:28.809 --> 45:31.395
Better get home
before the kids realize I'm gone.

46:02.759 --> 46:04.428
And we're gonna get your socks on.

46:05.429 --> 46:08.307
Oh, that's right. New socks.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.101
They look so good.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.061
And you look so cute.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.146
Oh.

46:14.646 --> 46:17.566
You look so good.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.485
Who's so handsome?

46:19.568 --> 46:20.903
Who's the handsomest?

46:21.320 --> 46:22.154
You are.

46:22.237 --> 46:23.780
[kissing]

46:30.537 --> 46:31.788
[man] Let's go, asshole.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.082
Don't wanna keep your mom waiting.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.262
["Blessed Assurance" playing on organ]

46:53.227 --> 46:54.102
Hey, Father.

46:57.481 --> 46:58.649
Here he is.

46:59.316 --> 47:00.984
-No, thank you.
-This is Rocky.

47:01.068 --> 47:02.778
-Hi, Father Sturgess.
-Hi.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.279
Thanks for coming.

47:04.363 --> 47:05.280
All right, Father.

47:05.364 --> 47:07.616
-Go in here?
-They want you in first.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.045
Hot, eh?

47:24.508 --> 47:25.467
Where's John?

47:26.468 --> 47:28.428
He'll be here. He promised, honey.

47:44.152 --> 47:47.573
[Eric] Is there a reason
we're moving so fucking slow here?

47:50.325 --> 47:51.159
Huh?

47:54.037 --> 47:57.332
I am sorry, ma'am. We are on a schedule.
We can't wait much longer.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.585
They said they'd have him here.

48:00.544 --> 48:01.378
Yes, ma'am.

48:02.212 --> 48:05.299
Would the parents and godparents
come forward to the font?

48:05.465 --> 48:06.592
I don't know what to do.

48:24.901 --> 48:26.653
We seem to be missing a godfather.

48:26.737 --> 48:29.364
Yeah, uh, my brother John is coming,

48:29.448 --> 48:32.492
but, um, I think he's running
a little late.

48:32.576 --> 48:37.581
Jesus said when two or three people
are gathered together,

48:38.832 --> 48:40.167
that he will be with them.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.961
So, he is now here with us.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.131
Could someone stand in for him
until he arrives?

48:46.214 --> 48:47.215

I don't...

Now, I did not know...

48:58.393 --> 48:59.478
Hannah O'Bannon,

49:00.604 --> 49:06.485
but I'm sure that she was a kind
and lovely woman, a good mother.

49:07.069 --> 49:10.197
I'm sure Jesus has made a place for her...

49:11.907 --> 49:13.116
in his eternal kingdom.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.043
[Kevin] Thank you.

49:25.420 --> 49:29.007
I've been a godfather before.
I know the responsibilities.

49:36.848 --> 49:38.934
Dude, what the fuck is going on?

49:39.685 --> 49:40.894
Settle down, O'Bannon.

49:42.270 --> 49:44.398
A few questions for the godparents.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.611
I'm not gonna fucking settle down.

49:49.695 --> 49:52.030
What the fuck is going on?
You're going slow.

49:53.365 --> 49:55.283
It's my mom's fucking funeral, dude.

49:55.367 --> 49:58.578
"Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.957
For the first heaven
and the first earth had passed away.

50:03.291 --> 50:07.462
And I saw a holy city coming down
from heaven. A new Jerusalem."

50:07.963 --> 50:10.882
-Why the fuck are we stopped?
-Transmission's shot. I'm sorry.

50:10.966 --> 50:13.677
Oh, fuck you. The transmission's not shot.
It sounded fine.

50:14.386 --> 50:16.054
[man] "And I heard a loud voice saying:

50:16.638 --> 50:19.599
'He shall wipe away every tear
from their eyes.

50:19.933 --> 50:24.938
And there will be no more death
or crying or grief or pain.

50:25.897 --> 50:28.442
For the old order of things
is passing away.'"

50:28.984 --> 50:30.694
Why don't you let me out, okay?

50:30.777 --> 50:32.696
I'll fix it, then we can fucking go.

50:32.779 --> 50:36.658
"Behold, I make all things new."

50:37.617 --> 50:38.744
[Chelsea] Thanks again for coming.

50:44.499 --> 50:46.668
Thanks for all your help to get Eric here.

50:47.502 --> 50:51.173
They said he was cleared to come,
but must have fucked it up somehow.

50:51.256 --> 50:53.425
I did everything I could to help him.

50:57.929 --> 51:00.432
It's my mom's fucking funeral!

51:01.183 --> 51:03.101
You see that SUV pull out earlier?

51:03.185 --> 51:04.519
Do you reject Satan?

51:05.479 --> 51:06.563
Yes, I do.

51:08.982 --> 51:09.900
No.

51:09.983 --> 51:12.694
Those fuckers wanted
to take photos of Eric if he showed.

51:15.864 --> 51:16.698
You saw them?

51:16.782 --> 51:18.700
Yeah. Right before the ceremony.

51:18.784 --> 51:20.952
You saw them, they had cameras and--?

51:21.036 --> 51:22.996
Yeah, some newspaper assholes.

51:24.122 --> 51:25.749
I told them to get lost
or I'd call the cops.

51:25.832 --> 51:27.125
And all his works?

51:27.209 --> 51:28.043
I do.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.050
And all his empty promises?

51:35.550 --> 51:36.510
I do.

51:38.094 --> 51:38.929
Yes.

51:39.971 --> 51:42.974
Thanks again for trying to get Eric out.

51:44.601 --> 51:45.602
I'm sorry.

51:45.685 --> 51:48.563
-We gotta head back.
-Have a little fucking compassion!

52:32.858 --> 52:34.401
[security door buzzes]

52:40.073 --> 52:42.826
-Thanks for the help.
-Whatever you need, Detective.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.730
