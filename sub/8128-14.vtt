     Oh, my. I'll never get over

00:58.424 --> 00:59.791
    Who?                        

00:59.793 --> 01:01.325
                "Dear Abby."    

01:03.228 --> 01:06.097
She gives me a pain in the neck.

01:06.099 --> 01:07.231
                She's so clever.

01:07.233 --> 01:10.735
            She knows the answer
             to every question. 

01:10.737 --> 01:13.538
             In all the years   
          I've been reading her,

01:13.540 --> 01:17.408
      not once did she ever say,
            "I don't know."     

01:18.944 --> 01:23.447
            Or even,            
      "Let me think about that."

01:23.449 --> 01:25.784
      She ain't so smart.       

01:25.786 --> 01:28.352
      She sets herself up       
    with them things.           

01:28.354 --> 01:29.854
        You don't think         
     she picks them letters

            do you?             

01:34.026 --> 01:35.426
    What do you mean?           

01:35.428 --> 01:37.395
I mean she takes the easy ones, 

01:37.397 --> 01:39.297
like, for instance, I seen, uh, 

01:39.299 --> 01:43.501
  "Dear Abby, I'm a young girl  
    nuts about a guy.           

01:43.503 --> 01:44.602
     "I want to marry him.      

01:44.604 --> 01:46.504
      "My mother says yes,      
    my father says no.          

01:46.506 --> 01:49.640
    What should I do?           
    Signed, Unhappy."           

01:49.642 --> 01:53.377
                 Oh, my, that's 
                a hard question.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.781
             I wouldn't know how
             to answer that one.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.782
         Jeez, I would.         

01:57.784 --> 01:59.283
    I'd say, "Dear Unhappy,     

01:59.285 --> 02:00.719
     "do what your old man      
        tells you.              

02:00.721 --> 02:01.920
         "He knows what         
      he's talking about.       

02:01.922 --> 02:04.288
    That's how he got           
      to be your father."       

02:05.858 --> 02:10.161
  I wonder what Dear Abby does  
    when she has a problem.     

02:10.163 --> 02:12.097
    Who cares, Edith?           

02:12.099 --> 02:15.800
Maybe she writes to Ann Landers.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.001
[DOORBELL RINGS]                

02:17.003 --> 02:19.403
Now, whoever that is,           

02:19.405 --> 02:22.941
I don't want somebody           
in here on my day off.          

02:22.943 --> 02:24.642
Oh, hi, Irene!                  
                    Hi, Edith!  

02:24.644 --> 02:26.778
      Ooh, hello, Archie.       

02:26.780 --> 02:28.279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.               

02:28.281 --> 02:32.350
I bet that means, "Who needs    
her around on my day off?"      

02:32.352 --> 02:36.755
    Oh, Archie didn't mean that,
          did you, Archie?      

02:36.757 --> 02:39.724
        Don't ever argue        
      with a guest, Edith.      

02:40.926 --> 02:43.027
 That was a shot,               
wasn't it, Archie?              

02:43.029 --> 02:44.028
Yeah, that's right, Irene.      

02:44.030 --> 02:46.664
One of my sad expressions.      

02:46.666 --> 02:48.499
Listen, Edith, as soon          
as Frank gets ready,            

02:48.501 --> 02:50.168
we're going to                  
the Museum of Natural History.  

02:50.170 --> 02:51.169
You wanna go with us?           

02:51.171 --> 02:53.404
              No.               

02:53.406 --> 02:55.706
             Oh, I'd love to go.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.210
            I ain't been there  
          since the sixth grade.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.045
                      I'll go up
                     and change.

03:01.047 --> 03:04.149
You sure you don't              
wanna come along, Archie?       

03:04.151 --> 03:05.150
         Ah, what for?          

03:05.152 --> 03:06.550
  Go all the way into the city  

03:06.552 --> 03:07.952
  to see a bunch of dead bones  

03:07.954 --> 03:10.321
 standing around doing nothing. 

03:10.323 --> 03:12.423
I don't get you, Archie.        

03:12.425 --> 03:16.060
Don't you have any interest     
in learning about the past?     

03:16.062 --> 03:18.462
      Certainly I have interest 
     in learning about the past,

03:18.464 --> 03:21.933
  like, for instance, right here
 I'm reading <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

03:21.935 --> 03:24.068
                Why do you think
                 I'm doing that?

03:24.070 --> 03:25.569
                  This is full  
            of the past here.   

03:25.571 --> 03:27.672
          I'm looking over      
last year's batting averages,   

03:27.674 --> 03:30.708
              all the records   
          of championship teams.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.812
    All of that is what you call
    "histororical" matter.      

03:35.181 --> 03:37.548
        Pretty good magazine.   
            You oughta read it. 

03:37.550 --> 03:39.350
    Only lately they've been    
      giving over too many pages

03:39.352 --> 03:41.585
             to women in sports.

03:41.587 --> 03:43.754
And why shouldn't they?         

03:43.756 --> 03:46.791
             Because women ain't
            important in sports.

03:46.793 --> 03:51.296
What about all the women who won
gold medals at the Olympics?    

03:51.298 --> 03:53.531
      Oh, don't talk about them,
            will you?           

03:53.533 --> 03:55.633
        I seen them dames on TV.

03:55.635 --> 03:58.569
            They look more like 
        a bunch of lumpy men.   

04:00.439 --> 04:03.208
     I thought they looked      
        very attractive.        

04:03.210 --> 04:04.909
Ah, come on, will you, Irene?   

04:04.911 --> 04:06.677
        Even the judges couldn't
            figure them out.    

04:06.679 --> 04:07.778
        They had to give them...

04:07.780 --> 04:10.414
          What do you call,     
            hermone tests.      

04:12.985 --> 04:17.154
They found out most of them had 
  more hismones than hermones.  

04:18.891 --> 04:22.393
    That's like my saying       
    that all men are idiots     

04:22.395 --> 04:26.797
    because one of them says    
     so many stupid things.     

04:31.237 --> 04:32.737
         All I'm saying is      

04:32.739 --> 04:34.839
that women shouldn't be messing 
around with men's sports,       

04:34.841 --> 04:37.175
    because a man could beat    
     a woman any old time.      

04:37.177 --> 04:41.679
You mean like Bobby Riggs       
     beat Billie Jean King?     

04:43.749 --> 04:47.785
         I don't even think     
that tennis is a man's sport.   

04:47.787 --> 04:49.287
  When I think of a man's sport,

04:49.289 --> 04:52.223
        I think of a sport where
    you get some bones broke.   

04:53.592 --> 04:55.093
         Like football.         

04:55.095 --> 04:56.794
             That's right.      

04:56.796 --> 04:59.297
        I think getting         
     bones broke is stupid.     

05:01.000 --> 05:05.403
    Hey, Irene, ain't you got   
    no love for your country?   

05:05.405 --> 05:07.372
 I must have missed something.  

05:07.374 --> 05:09.640
    I thought we were           
    talking about football.     

05:09.642 --> 05:12.710
    Football is your country!   

05:12.712 --> 05:17.015
  Football is the only sport the
  commies ain't stolen from us. 

05:18.717 --> 05:21.085
    It's why you can travel     
  all over the civilized world  

05:21.087 --> 05:22.453
    and you won't find          
        an all-American         

05:22.455 --> 05:26.557
    any place but right here    
in the good old U.S. of A.      

05:26.559 --> 05:28.859
Tell me, Archie.                

05:28.861 --> 05:31.495
What manly games                
do you play?                    

05:31.497 --> 05:33.197
            Well, I used to play
             a little football. 

05:33.199 --> 05:34.799
                I played        
              a lot of baseball.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.036
                I still bowl    
            in the men's league.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.971
                I shoot pool.   

05:39.973 --> 05:41.906
    Pool?                       
             That's right, pool.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.507
You any good at it?             

05:43.509 --> 05:46.577
                      [LAUGHS]  

05:46.579 --> 05:48.413
                  I hold my own.

05:48.415 --> 05:50.681
Do you think                    
you could beat a woman?         

05:50.683 --> 05:54.452
        With one eye closed,    
    one hand tied behind my back

05:54.454 --> 05:57.621
                  and a bad case
                    of the flu. 

05:57.623 --> 05:58.823
Okay, I challenge you.          

05:58.825 --> 06:01.225
              You challenge me? 
            You're crazy, Irene.

06:01.227 --> 06:02.660
I'm serious.                    

06:02.662 --> 06:04.495
                    Oh, come on,
                      will you? 

06:04.497 --> 06:06.965
    Anyway, a gentleman don't   
        play pool with no woman.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.799
         I got $10 says         
        I can beat you.         

06:08.801 --> 06:11.702
        You're on!              

06:11.704 --> 06:14.939
     Ten bucks puts a whole     
      different complexity      

06:14.941 --> 06:16.707
    on the situation, Irene.    

06:16.709 --> 06:19.610
Just let me call up Kelsey's bar

06:19.612 --> 06:22.713
and see if that pool table      
is free for a little action.    

06:22.715 --> 06:25.383
  Oh, not right now. We're going
 to the museum in a few minutes.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.585
Oh, come on. You said           
you'd play me for 10 bucks.     

06:27.587 --> 06:28.752
Don't be copping out now.       

06:28.754 --> 06:29.887
        Nobody's copping out.   

06:29.889 --> 06:31.555
                  We'll go to   
            the museum later.   

06:31.557 --> 06:32.556
Yeah, all right.                

06:32.558 --> 06:34.258
            Kelsey?             
Yeah, Archie Bunker here.       

06:34.260 --> 06:37.728
    Hey, is the table           
gonna be free down there?       

06:37.730 --> 06:39.263
     Oh, it is. Ah, great.      

06:39.265 --> 06:43.401
  I got a pigeon I gotta pluck  
      for about 10 bucks.       

06:43.403 --> 06:45.203
      Yeah, a lady pigeon.      

06:45.205 --> 06:48.006
What you call a pigeoness.      

06:48.008 --> 06:51.376
No, no. She challenged me.      

06:51.378 --> 06:52.543
            [LAUGHS]            

06:52.545 --> 06:55.046
Kelsey's hysterical             
on the line here.               

06:55.048 --> 06:56.780
No, no, no.                     
You know her.                   

06:56.782 --> 06:59.317
Frank Lorenzo's wife,           
Irene.                          

06:59.319 --> 07:01.152
Oh, hold on.                    
I'll ask her.                   

07:01.154 --> 07:03.754
Kelsey wants to know if he can  
have $5 worth of the action.    

07:03.756 --> 07:04.955
              Tell him I accept.

07:04.957 --> 07:07.425
Hey, Kelsey, you just           
won yourself five bucks.        

07:07.427 --> 07:09.460
Yeah, we'll be right down.      

07:09.462 --> 07:10.628
Come on, Irene.                 
Let's go.                       

07:10.630 --> 07:12.030
          I'll be back          
    in a few minutes.           

07:12.032 --> 07:13.731
                 I just want    
             to change my shoes.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.867
What, are you gonna play        
with your feet?                 

07:16.869 --> 07:21.406
Well, I could. And I think      
      I'd still beat you.       

07:21.408 --> 07:24.275
Oh, Irene, I'm still waiting.   
  Aren't we going to the museum?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.278
        Later. I got a date     
        to shoot pool for money.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.946
No kidding?                     
Who's the pigeon?               

07:28.948 --> 07:32.716
                  Minnesota Fats
                    over there. 

07:35.587 --> 07:39.090
          Archie, are-- Are you 
        really gonna play Irene?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.525
Yeah. What are you              
laughing about?                 

07:40.527 --> 07:41.692
                 [LAUGHS LOUDLY]

07:41.694 --> 07:44.562
Okay, come on.                  
Don't-- Don't poke me, huh?     

07:44.564 --> 07:47.898
Yeah, I'm gonna play Irene. It's
gonna cost you a little dough.  

07:47.900 --> 07:50.601
The 10 bucks she bet with me    
and five bucks with Kelsey.     

07:50.603 --> 07:52.970
Ooh, is that all you're betting?
      She let you off easy.     

07:52.972 --> 07:55.506
Ah, get out of here.            
She don't stand a chance.       

07:55.508 --> 07:57.841
             Archie, she's good.
              She even beats me.

07:57.843 --> 08:02.613
So what?                        
You're only a cook.             

08:02.615 --> 08:05.816
You wouldn't know a rack of     
balls from a bowl of zucchini.  

08:05.818 --> 08:09.620
Archie, she's played a lot of   
  pool and beat a lot of people.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.689
Yeah? Well, I'll tell you       
something, Frank.               

08:11.691 --> 08:14.292
I'm gonna beat                  
the pants off of her.           

08:14.294 --> 08:15.926
And you ought to                
thank me for that               

08:15.928 --> 08:18.229
because then you can            
start wearing them again.       

08:19.965 --> 08:21.966
What's that                     
supposed to mean?               

08:21.968 --> 08:24.569
  I only mean that she's a woman
    who spends all day at home  

08:24.571 --> 08:26.770
banging nails into the walls and
messing around with the plumbing

08:26.772 --> 08:28.473
        and challenging me      
             to shoot pool.     

08:28.475 --> 08:30.141
                She's more manly
                  than womanly. 

08:30.143 --> 08:32.143
You take that                   
back, Archie!                   

08:32.145 --> 08:33.544
 Because where                  
 I come from,                   

08:33.546 --> 08:35.613
if a man talks like that        
about another man's wife,       

08:35.615 --> 08:37.748
he don't talk again             
for a long time!                

08:37.750 --> 08:41.784
    Jeez, what are you gonna do,
    gag me with your apron?     

08:41.787 --> 08:45.256
You-- You talk about Irene      
behind her back,                

08:45.258 --> 08:47.258
but I'm gonna say this          
to your face.                   

08:47.260 --> 08:49.893
If you have any doubts          
about my wife being a woman,    

08:49.895 --> 08:54.665
it's because you're worried     
about yourself being a man.     

08:54.667 --> 08:59.203
    Hey! you're talking to      
    a veteran of WWII over here.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.205
I don't care who you are.       

09:01.207 --> 09:02.806
Take back what                  
you said about my wife.         

09:02.808 --> 09:05.709
         All I'm saying is that 
    your wife ain't satisfied   

09:05.711 --> 09:07.945
          with being a woman,   
      she wants to be a man too.

09:07.947 --> 09:11.182
That's it! You insult me,       
you insult my family.           

09:11.184 --> 09:13.951
You insult my family,           
you insult my honor.            

09:13.953 --> 09:17.054
Take this! Malocchio!           

09:22.528 --> 09:24.662
                What the hell   
                      is that?  

09:24.664 --> 09:27.798
A Sicilian curse,               
the evil eye.                   

09:27.800 --> 09:30.934
Malocchio, malocchio,           
malocchio!                      

09:35.474 --> 09:39.377
  Well, I'll just give you a New
 York curse, the waving fingers.

09:44.249 --> 09:45.583
        What's going on?        

09:45.585 --> 09:46.950
                  Hey, hey, hey.

09:46.952 --> 09:49.520
        You got any questions   
        about me being a man,   

09:49.522 --> 09:51.556
                 ask my witness,
                     ask her.   

09:51.558 --> 09:52.690
        Ask me what?            

09:52.692 --> 09:55.626
                    Oh, stay out
                      of this.  

09:55.628 --> 09:57.027
             Hello.             

09:57.029 --> 09:58.663
I'm surprised                   
at you, Archie.                 

09:58.665 --> 10:00.198
            You call yourself   
                 a man? A man?  

10:00.200 --> 10:02.300
     And that's the way you talk
     about your neighbor's wife?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.535
    All right, Frank,           
    don't get excited!          

10:04.537 --> 10:07.971
 If it'll make you feel better, 
  I'll admit it, Irene is a---  

10:07.973 --> 10:09.507
                        A woman.
        All right!              

10:09.509 --> 10:12.009
                  That's better.
          Yeah.                 

10:12.011 --> 10:13.777
Is that what you                
wanted to know, Archie?         

10:13.779 --> 10:15.580
I could've told you that.       

10:17.249 --> 10:18.449
                        Yeah,   
                     so could I.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.850
                 You're not     
        very observant, Arch.   

10:19.852 --> 10:21.719
         Oh, get lost,          
        will you?               

10:21.721 --> 10:25.456
Where is Irene?                 
We was going to the museum.     

10:25.458 --> 10:26.557
     She'll be right back.      

10:26.559 --> 10:28.593
        Yeah, but before        
    she goes to the museum,     

10:28.595 --> 10:31.629
she's gonna shoot a game of pool
     with me for 10 bucks.      

10:31.631 --> 10:35.165
Ohh! I didn't know              
Irene played pool.              

10:35.167 --> 10:37.501
                  Well, she says
                     she does.  

10:37.503 --> 10:38.902
         But I'm gonna          
      teach her a lesson.       

10:38.904 --> 10:41.271
    After this, she'll          
     keep her big yap shut.     

10:41.273 --> 10:43.474
                      Malocchio!

10:45.244 --> 10:47.378
What, again?                    

10:47.380 --> 10:49.313
              Yes. The malocchio
                 is on again.   

10:49.315 --> 10:52.483
Oh, gee. What's                 
supposed to happen?             

10:52.485 --> 10:54.017
                I don't know,   
             but something will.

10:54.019 --> 10:56.621
      The malocchio works       
      like a knuckleball.       

10:56.623 --> 10:59.156
         You never know         
what it's gonna do. Voom!       

11:03.027 --> 11:05.028
Can you imagine this guy        

11:05.030 --> 11:07.698
believing in that kinda         
superstitious bunk?             

11:07.700 --> 11:10.000
  Sure, Arch. A lot of people   
    believe in magic spells.    

11:10.002 --> 11:11.969
I mean, there's even magic      
         in the Bible.          

11:11.971 --> 11:15.973
 Aw, shut up, you atheist, you. 

11:15.975 --> 11:17.875
        You know nothing        
        about the Bible.        

11:17.877 --> 11:20.311
 The Bible is full of miracles, 
        no magic.               

11:20.313 --> 11:22.179
  God would never fool around   
         with no magic.         

11:22.181 --> 11:24.348
      What about the story      
     of Sodom and Gomorrah?     

11:24.350 --> 11:27.117
 I mean, didn't God turn Lot's  
  wife into a pillar of salt?   

11:27.119 --> 11:29.553
     That's right, because      
when she was running away       

11:29.555 --> 11:30.788
  from them two dirty cities,   

11:30.790 --> 11:33.791
      she stopped to take       
     a look at her behind.

11:45.136 --> 11:46.704
                Okay, I'm ready.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.005
                Let's go,       
                 come on.       

11:48.007 --> 11:49.774
      Okay, let's go.           
         Let's go.              

11:49.776 --> 11:51.409
        Oh, Edith,              
    about the museum--          

11:51.411 --> 11:54.578
Oh, yeah, I've heard. You and   
Archie are gonna play pool.     

11:54.580 --> 11:56.447
I'll go along                   
and watch.                      

11:56.449 --> 11:57.815
Are you ready,                  
Archie?                         

11:57.817 --> 12:00.384
             Hey, hey, hey.     
            Ah, what's this?    

12:00.386 --> 12:06.056
Irene, I didn't know            
you played the clarinet.        

12:06.058 --> 12:09.226
                 Hey, that ain't
                  the clarinet. 

12:09.228 --> 12:12.396
        It's a carrying case    
         for a private pool cue.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.666
            See that? You put   
              them two together.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.002
     I didn't know you had      
a private pool cue, Irene.      

12:19.004 --> 12:20.471
                Sure. Don't you?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.172
              No.               

12:22.174 --> 12:25.543
I remember,                     
I saw Paul Newman               

12:25.545 --> 12:28.412
carry one of them               
in <i>The Rustler.</i>                 

12:28.414 --> 12:31.081
            Oh, no.             

12:31.083 --> 12:33.851
  That was called <i>The Hustler.</i>  

12:33.853 --> 12:37.087
 Hey, Arch, I'll bet you a buck 
    she can take you.           

12:37.089 --> 12:38.255
Save your money.                

12:38.257 --> 12:40.424
Just because her old man        
can afford to buy her           

12:40.426 --> 12:42.827
a private pool cue              
don't mean she's no pool shark. 

12:42.829 --> 12:44.495
                He didn't buy it
            for me. I won it.   

12:46.264 --> 12:47.598
              Huh?              
Yeah.                           

12:47.600 --> 12:49.233
      Look at that plaque.      

12:49.235 --> 12:55.806
"To Irene Lorenzo, first prize, 
Hudson Billiard Academy."       

12:55.808 --> 12:57.541
    Archie, you wanna           
      make that two bucks?      

12:57.543 --> 12:59.042
Get outta here!                 

12:59.044 --> 13:00.277
    You're gonna lose.          

13:00.279 --> 13:01.746
        Okay,                   
  let's shoot pool.             

13:01.748 --> 13:03.681
    Let's go. Come on, let's go.
Come on, Archie.                

13:03.683 --> 13:05.416
        Yeah, all right,        
all right, yeah. Go ahead.      

13:05.418 --> 13:09.052
Yeah, go ahead, all of you.     
I've just gotta get my hat here.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.088
