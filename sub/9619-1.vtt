{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT IT LOOKED FAMILIAR.

01:46.981 --> 01:47.440
{\an1}BUT I DON'T RECALL

01:47.524 --> 01:50.318
{\an1}THE BUTTONS BEING ORANGE.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.528

{\an1}&gt;&gt; GOOD. PERFECT. WHY?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.407
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, ORIGINALLY,

01:56.491 --> 01:57.283
{\an1}THEY WERE BLUE,

01:57.367 --> 02:00.411
{\an1}BUT THE BLUE IS JUST SORT OF--

02:00.495 --> 02:02.664

18:25.521 --> 18:26.772
{\an1}IT'S JUST HIGH SCHOOL.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.607
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HIGH SCHOOL'S PRETTY SCARY.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.317

18:58.720 --> 19:00.055
{\an1}AND MAKE EVERYONE AROUND THEM

19:00.138 --> 19:01.098
{\an1}FEEL SMALL.
