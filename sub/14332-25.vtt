09:27.600 --> 09:29.468
- [gasps]
IT'S YOU.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.637
YOU'RE WEARING
ONE GLASS SHOE.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.373
THAT MEANS
YOU'RE MY ONE TRUE LOVE.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.075
- I'M COSMORELLA.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.144
- OH,
THAT'S A WEIRD NAME.

09:38.210 --> 09:41.580
FROM NOW ON,
YOUR NAME IS GARY HARDCASTLE.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.150
- OKAY.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.589

AND GARY HARDCASTLE

09:50.656 --> 09:52.291
LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER,

09:52.358 --> 09:55.328
WHICH IS WHAT I'LL DO
IF POOF EVER GOES TO SLEEP.

09:55.394 --> 09:57.663
- I ATE 11 POUNDS
OF CHOCOLATE.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.066
I'LL PROBABLY BE AWAKE
UNTIL EASTER.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.767
THEN I'LL GET MORE CHOCOLATE.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.103
- HMM, MAYBE YOU SHOULD READ HIM
ANOTHER STORY.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.505
HOW ABOUT <i> SHRIMP LOUIE</i>
<i>AND THE BED OF LETTUCE?</i>

10:06.572 --> 10:08.507
IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE SHRIMP
NAMED LOUIE

10:08.574 --> 10:10.276
WHO HAS AN EDIBLE MATTRESS.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.578
- YOU'RE STILL READING
THE COOKBOOK, COSMO.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.014
- OH, REALLY?
WOULD A COOKBOOK SAY

10:15.081 --> 10:17.483
"MAKE SURE YOU THOROUGHLY WASH
AND DEVEIN THE SHRIMP"?

10:17.550 --> 10:18.951
- YES.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.320
HOW ABOUT I READ
<i>THE THREE LITTLE FAIRIES?</i>

10:21.387 --> 10:24.090
- WHATEVER, I'M TOO GROWN UP
FOR FAIRY TALES.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.292
- BUT APPARENTLY NOT
TOO GROWN UP FOR A STORY

10:26.359 --> 10:28.661
WHERE THE HERO FARTS HIS ENEMY
OFF A CLIFF.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.296
- BACK TO THE FAIRY TALE.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.132
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WERE THREE LITTLE FAIRIES.

10:33.199 --> 10:36.302
THEY ALL DECIDED TO BUILD THEIR
HOUSES RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.603
- CHECK IT OUT, GUYS.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.705
I BUILT MY PLACE
OUT OF TENNIS BALLS.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.475
I CAN TOTALLY PLAY FETCH
WITH MY OWN GUEST BATHROOM.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.210

10:44.276 --> 10:46.379
YOU SHOULD'VE USED MORE
SENSIBLE BUILDING MATERIALS,

10:46.445 --> 10:47.880

10:47.947 --> 10:51.484
BEHOLD, MY HOUSE
MADE OF FRIED CHEESE STICKS.

A MARINARA SAUCE MOAT.

10:55.554 --> 10:57.823

OUCH, AH!

10:57.890 --> 11:00.659
I JUST BURNT THE ROOF OF MY
MOUTH WITH THE ROOF OF MY HOUSE.

11:02.728 --> 11:06.132

A HIGH-TECH SECURITY SYSTEM.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.668
- WANDA, I THINK YOUR SECURITY
SYSTEM IS A LITTLE OVER THE TOP.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.370
THERE'S NOTHING DANGEROUS
AROUND HERE.

11:11.437 --> 11:13.539

IT'S HOTTER THAN MY JALAPEÑO
POPPER HOUSE IN THE POCONOS.

- SILENCE!
NOW PREPARE TO TASTE MY WRATH.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.493

BLOW UP YOUR HOUSES.

11:55.081 --> 11:57.116

TO DO THIS.

11:57.183 --> 11:58.184
- ACTUALLY, I DO.

AND VOILA, I'M A LAWYER,
THE MOST EVIL THING THERE IS.

12:14.533 --> 12:17.136

THEY WERE AN EXTRA $8.50.

TO BEGIN WITH?

12:22.608 --> 12:26.145

- AND MAYBE
WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE,

18:38.350 --> 18:40.118
YOU COULD DO SOME CLEANING.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.788
I CAN'T SEE MY HANDSOME FACE IN
ANY OF THE REFLECTIVE SURFACES.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.289
- WHAT?

18:44.356 --> 18:45.657
- YOU KNOW, WASH A FEW DISHES,
MOP THE FLOOR,

18:45.724 --> 18:47.493
MAYBE CLEAN OUT
THE REFRIGERATOR.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.294
BARKY MADE
SOME HOMEMADE GUACAMOLE

18:49.361 --> 18:51.163
THAT SMELLS LIKE
A BOWL OF THROW-UP.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.165
- LOOK AT IT THIS WAY--
IF YOU PRETEND TO BE

18:53.232 --> 18:55.667
OUR HOUSEKEEPER,
NO ONE WILL BE SUSPICIOUS.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.870
- WELL, I GUESS
IF IT'LL KEEP ME

18:57.936 --> 19:00.038
OUT OF THE TOOTH FAIRY'S
CLUTCHES.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.274
- OH, I SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING.

19:02.341 --> 19:05.010
PERHAPS SHE SHOULD HIDE IN
THE LAUNDRY ROOM AND DO A LOAD.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.512
I'VE BEEN GOING COMMANDO
FOR WEEKS,

19:06.578 --> 19:09.147
AND SNAPPY WON'T LET ME
BORROW HIS DIAPERS.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.683
- YOUR SQUARE BUTT
WILL STRETCH THEM OUT.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.118
- I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.620
SNOW WANDA
SHOULD MOVE MY WEIGHTS

19:14.686 --> 19:16.021
FROM THE BASEMENT
TO THE ATTIC.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.656
- NO, CLEAN MY ROOM.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.491
- NO, DO MY LAUNDRY.

19:19.558 --> 19:21.627
- NO, UNSTRETCH MY DIAPER.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.629
- MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL,

19:23.695 --> 19:26.298
NOW WHO'S THE FAIRIEST
OF THEM ALL?

19:26.365 --> 19:27.733
- OH, IT'S YOU.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.202
JUST KIDDING,
IT'S STILL SNOW WANDA.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.504
- WHAT?
BUT I DROVE HER OUT OF TOWN.

19:32.571 --> 19:36.041
- NO, YOU DROVE HER A BLOCK AWAY
TO THE SEVEN FAIRIES' HOUSE.

19:36.108 --> 19:38.343
SEE?
- OH, NO.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.146
WITH HER AROUND,
I'LL NEVER GET PRINCE JOHN.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.915
WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

19:42.981 --> 19:45.884
- THAT TALKING TO A MIRROR IS
THE FIRST SIGN OF INSANITY?

19:45.951 --> 19:48.487
- NO,
IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED,

19:48.554 --> 19:50.722
YOU POISON SOMEONE
WITH A CARAMEL APPLE.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.858
- NO ONE SAYS THAT.
- I JUST DID.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.860
- [groans]

19:54.927 --> 19:58.397
NOW HOW EXACTLY IS THE FRONT
YARD A GOOD HIDING PLACE?

19:58.463 --> 19:59.765
- I SEE YOUR POINT.

19:59.831 --> 20:03.101
JUST PUT ON THIS SKI MASK
AND KEEP MOWING.

20:03.168 --> 20:06.905
- HELLO THERE, YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE A SNACK.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.174
- AND YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE A SHAVE.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.611
- HERE,
HAVE A GLOWING CARAMEL APPLE.

20:14.646 --> 20:18.584
- MMM,
THIS IS DELICIOU--

20:18.650 --> 20:21.620
- [laughs evilly]

20:24.423 --> 20:27.025
- OH, NO,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO OUR SLAVE?

20:27.092 --> 20:30.128
I MEAN THAT POOR GIRL
WE TOOK IN AND HELPED.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.763
- I POISONED HER.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.800
NOW NOTHING WILL STAND
BETWEEN ME AND PRINCE JOHN.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.369
- WAKE HER UP,
OR THE HOMEOWNERS' ASSOCIATION

20:37.436 --> 20:39.738
WILL FINE US FOR HAVING
AN UNCONSCIOUS GIRL ON OUR LAWN,

20:39.805 --> 20:41.373
AGAIN.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.141
- I COULDN'T WAKE HER UP
EVEN IF I WANTED TO,

20:43.208 --> 20:44.576
WHICH I DON'T.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.111
SHE CAN ONLY BE WOKEN UP
BY A KISS

20:46.178 --> 20:47.879
FROM HER ONE, TRUE LOVE.

20:47.946 --> 20:50.482
- DID ANYONE HIT IT OFF
WITH THE CLEANING LADY?

20:50.549 --> 20:51.817
IF SO, KISS HER.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.286
SHE HASN'T MOVED
MY WEIGHTS YET.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.722
- [gasps]
THE PRINCE IS HERE.

20:56.788 --> 20:59.791
OUT OF THE WAY, PLUNGER HEAD,
I'M LOOKING FOR PRINCE JOHN.

20:59.858 --> 21:02.661
- YOU FOUND HIM,
EXCEPT I'M COSMO,

21:02.728 --> 21:04.162
THE PRINCE OF JOHNS.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.931
I SELL HIGH-END TOILETS.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.566
- YOU'RE PRINCE JOHN?

21:07.633 --> 21:10.502
BUT YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HANDSOME AND RICH.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.438
- WELL, I AM FLUSH WITH CASH,
GET IT?

21:13.505 --> 21:14.606
TOILET HUMOR.

21:14.673 --> 21:17.142
[laughter]

21:17.209 --> 21:19.645
- OKAY,
I AM NOT MARRYING YOU.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.114
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A MIRROR TO BREAK.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.750
- OOH,
A PRETTY LADY.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.486
BIGGER OOH!
SHE'S GOT CARAMEL ON HER LIP.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.488
MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.657
MWAH!

21:31.723 --> 21:33.959
BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN,
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE

21:34.026 --> 21:35.794
MY QUEEN OF LATRINES?

21:35.861 --> 21:37.362
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,

21:37.429 --> 21:41.166
BUT ANYTHING BEATS HANGING OUT
WITH THESE CLOWNS.

21:42.868 --> 21:46.138
AND THAT'S HOW SNOW WANDA
MET HER PRINCE.

21:46.204 --> 21:47.806
- I GOT TO SAY,
THOSE FAIRY TALES

21:47.873 --> 21:49.808
ARE PRETTY GOOD,
CONSIDERING THEY HAD CHARACTERS

21:49.875 --> 21:51.043
WHO DIDN'T FART OR BURP.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.711
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.613
WANDA DIDN'T READ THE PART
AFTER COSMORELLA ATE

21:54.680 --> 21:56.548
THE MINI PIZZAS
AT THE BOWLING BALL.

21:56.615 --> 22:00.118
- SPEAKING OF MINI PIZZAS,
I COULD GO FOR A BEDTIME SNACK.

22:00.185 --> 22:01.953
- HOW ABOUT A FOOPY MEAL?

22:02.020 --> 22:03.789
EAT IT FAST,
BECAUSE I'M KICKING YOU OUT

22:03.855 --> 22:06.725
TO BUILD A FAST FOOP RESTAURANT
IN YOUR ROOM.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.528
- SURE, FOOP, BUT FIRST,
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE

22:09.594 --> 22:11.396
A GLOWING CARAMEL APPLE?

22:11.463 --> 22:12.698
- IS IT FREE?
- YEP.

22:12.764 --> 22:17.736
- DON'T MIND IF I DO.

22:17.803 --> 22:20.472
SLEEP, SNORE, SLEEP--

22:20.539 --> 22:23.575
- HE'S GONNA BE HERE AWHILE
'CAUSE I AM NOT KISSING HIM.

22:23.642 --> 22:27.079
- AND WE ALL LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.915
- MY DIAPER IS
ALL STRETCHED OUT.
