01:21.425 --> 01:23.125
Are you guys wearing one scarf?

01:23.126 --> 01:24.961
Yep, Charles
forgot his this morning.

01:24.962 --> 01:26.462
It's actually quite romantic.

01:26.463 --> 01:27.897
I think he did it on purpose.

Uh, let's just say,
I definitely did it on purpose.

Genevieve and I have big news.

01:43.180 --> 01:44.813
Is this something other
people would keep private?

01:44.848 --> 01:46.949
Big time!
We're trying to have a baby!

01:46.950 --> 01:48.451
Oh, wow!

01:48.452 --> 01:50.086
That is awesome.

But wait, Charles,
I thought you were sterile.

01:52.456 --> 01:54.490
I distinctly remember
you using the phrase...

01:54.491 --> 01:55.558
Shooting dust.

01:55.559 --> 01:56.792
Yes, thank you for
not making me say it.

01:56.793 --> 01:58.427
Yeah, it's true
I lost the ability

01:58.428 --> 02:00.629
to procreate after the accident.

02:00.630 --> 02:02.998
Drop your weapons!

Yeah, I still don't know why
you dove in crotch first.

02:11.008 --> 02:12.541
Thankfully, my ex-wife, Eleanor,

02:12.542 --> 02:14.677
made me get a vasectomy
a year before that.

02:14.678 --> 02:16.812
As a precaution,
I froze some sperm...

02:16.813 --> 02:18.280
a lot of sperm.

02:18.281 --> 02:21.984
Guy going in after me
was like, "Whoa, nice!"

02:21.985 --> 02:24.954
Wow, he sounds
like a gross dude.

02:24.955 --> 02:26.255
- Yeah.
- Should we go into work?

02:26.256 --> 02:27.355
- Yes.
- Great.

02:28.392 --> 02:29.992
Hey, so do you think maybe

02:29.993 --> 02:32.194
you're rushing into
the whole baby thing?

02:32.195 --> 02:34.195
I mean, you guys have only
been dating three months.

02:41.872 --> 02:44.407
Okay, yeah, so,
hey, this is awesome.

02:44.408 --> 02:45.474
You're gonna have a baby.

02:45.475 --> 02:46.876
I know!

02:46.877 --> 02:48.544
And you're gonna be
its best friend.

02:48.545 --> 02:50.379
Ah, well, based on the age diff,

02:50.380 --> 02:53.049
maybe more of a fun

02:53.050 --> 02:55.851

nonnegotiable.

02:59.656 --> 03:00.656
Here's the deal, Steven.

03:00.657 --> 03:02.324
We already got you
on shoplifting.

03:02.325 --> 03:04.493
Now let's talk about
the 200 cloned credit cards

03:04.494 --> 03:05.561
in your bag.

03:05.562 --> 03:06.862
I'm not saying anything.

03:06.863 --> 03:08.764
Look, punk, there are
two ways we can do this...

03:08.765 --> 03:10.399
the easy way or the hard way.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.034
Tell him what
the hard way is, boss.

03:12.035 --> 03:16.939
Well, first, Steven, we're
gonna fill out form 38E-J1,

03:16.940 --> 03:18.174
stating noncompliance.

03:18.175 --> 03:20.943
We send it to the DA, but do
they process it right away?

03:20.944 --> 03:22.945
No, because they're overwhelmed

03:22.946 --> 03:24.914
because Debra's
on maternity leave.

03:24.915 --> 03:27.349
So your court date won't be set
for six or eight weeks,

03:27.350 --> 03:29.685
and even then, you're gonna
have to block off the whole day,

03:29.686 --> 03:32.254
because they don't
give you a specific time.

03:32.255 --> 03:35.224
No, no, it's a window.

03:35.225 --> 03:36.292
Sir...

03:36.293 --> 03:37.860
Can I talk to you for a second?

03:37.861 --> 03:39.594
I thought we were gonna
to try to scare him.

03:39.629 --> 03:41.464
There's nothing scarier
than the realities

03:41.465 --> 03:42.932
of the municipal court system.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.433
Now, come on;
Let's get back in there

03:44.434 --> 03:46.435
and tell him about
how bad the website is.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.270
Look, I'll talk.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.705
Of course you will.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.773
But I'll only talk to her.

03:52.843 --> 03:55.444
You want to talk to Gina?

03:55.445 --> 03:57.679
Yeah, hi.
Do you sell purple pants?

03:59.015 --> 04:01.015
All right, well, good day, then.

04:02.886 --> 04:04.386
It's not the turnout
I was hoping for.

04:04.387 --> 04:06.155
Maybe I should've
offered free strudel;

04:06.156 --> 04:07.623
Then at least
Scully would've come.

04:07.624 --> 04:08.924
There's free strudel?

04:08.925 --> 04:11.527
Where the hell
did you come from?

04:11.528 --> 04:12.761
I don't get it.

04:12.762 --> 04:14.196
I am shocked that more people

04:14.197 --> 04:16.565
wouldn't want the tutelage
of our precinct's...

04:16.565 --> 04:19.101
nay, our city's
most esteemed sergeant.

04:19.101 --> 04:20.302
What do you want, Santiago?

04:20.303 --> 04:22.471
To learn the majestic art
of self-defense

04:22.472 --> 04:24.673
from our city's...
nay, our country's...

04:24.674 --> 04:26.208
Come on, man, out with it!

04:26.209 --> 04:27.308
I want to start class.

04:27.344 --> 04:29.345
Okay, I'm applying
for a mentorship program

04:29.346 --> 04:30.846
for up-and-coming detectives.

04:30.847 --> 04:32.181
It's called
"Star Achieving Mentors,

04:32.182 --> 04:35.384
Star Achieving Mentees,"
or SAM-SAM for short.

04:35.385 --> 04:36.818
Would you write me
a recommendation?

04:36.853 --> 04:38.087
Of course I will.

04:38.088 --> 04:39.255
You'd be great.

04:39.256 --> 04:40.256
Thank you, Sarge.

04:40.257 --> 04:41.557
All right, everyone.

04:41.558 --> 04:42.958
Pay attention.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.494
Santiago, I'm gonna come at you,

04:45.495 --> 04:47.296
and you're gonna take me down.

04:47.297 --> 04:48.597
You better impress me
if you want

04:48.598 --> 04:50.166
that recommendation to be good.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.332
I'm gonna try, Sarge.

04:51.368 --> 04:53.002
All right, here we go.

04:54.171 --> 04:55.171
- Oh, no, no!
- My nose!

04:55.172 --> 04:57.640
My nose!
You broke my nose!

04:57.641 --> 04:59.141
Oh, there's so much blood!

04:59.142 --> 05:00.409
I'm so sorry!

05:00.410 --> 05:01.410
Get me a towel!

05:01.411 --> 05:02.411
Okay, all right.

05:02.412 --> 05:04.980
And that's what you get
for lying about free strudel.

05:04.981 --> 05:06.015
Karma's a bitch.

05:06.016 --> 05:07.482
Get out of here, Scully!

05:09.586 --> 05:11.787
Case closed, justice served.

05:11.788 --> 05:14.689
Peralta amazing...
oh, God.

05:14.724 --> 05:16.225
Oh, no, no...

05:19.329 --> 05:21.130
Charles, Charles!

05:21.131 --> 05:22.363
Your ex-wife is here.

05:22.399 --> 05:23.799
Eleanor?

05:23.800 --> 05:25.534
The destroyer of worlds?

05:25.535 --> 05:27.036
- Why?
- Maybe it's nothing bad.

05:27.037 --> 05:28.837
Maybe some of your mail
got sent to her house.

05:28.838 --> 05:30.206
Oh, God, I hope not.

05:30.207 --> 05:32.040
If that happened,
she would be livid.

05:32.075 --> 05:33.809
Oh, well, just don't
assume the worst.

05:33.810 --> 05:34.944
That's all I'm saying.

05:34.945 --> 05:36.178
Then why did you
bring up the mail thing?

05:36.179 --> 05:37.212
I don't...

05:38.348 --> 05:39.748
Hello, Chunk.

05:39.749 --> 05:41.283
Heard you want your sperm.

05:41.284 --> 05:42.551
You gonna have to go through me.

05:42.552 --> 05:44.653
Oh, no, this is way worse
than the mail thing.

05:44.654 --> 05:45.821
What mail thing?

05:45.822 --> 05:47.156
Nothing.
There's no mail thing.

05:47.157 --> 05:48.857
There's no mail thing.
But it's my sperm.

05:48.858 --> 05:50.558
How did you even
find out I wanted it?

05:50.594 --> 05:52.361
Because the account's
under my name.

05:52.362 --> 05:53.762
Storage facility
called me saying

05:53.763 --> 05:55.464
that you were looking
to make a withdrawal.

05:55.465 --> 05:57.967
So I went ahead
and withdrew it for you.

05:57.968 --> 06:00.369
I have all of your sperm.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.104
But you don't even
care about it, Eleanor.

06:02.105 --> 06:03.439
I mean, remember?

06:03.440 --> 06:04.707
"Oh, hey, Charles,

06:04.708 --> 06:06.242
"I'll never have a baby with you

06:06.243 --> 06:07.443
"because I don't love you,

06:07.444 --> 06:09.378
and a child's
not gonna fix that!"

06:09.379 --> 06:11.447
Oof, when he started
doing the silly voice,

06:11.448 --> 06:14.083
I thought it was gonna be
more fun, but... wasn't.

06:14.084 --> 06:15.184
Well, I do not want your DNA.

06:15.185 --> 06:16.218
I want something else.

06:16.219 --> 06:17.753
I hit some dumbass with my car.

06:17.754 --> 06:19.555
Now he's suing me.

06:19.556 --> 06:21.790
What I want is for you
to use your badge

06:21.791 --> 06:24.426
and your gun to intimidate him
into dropping the case.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.962
Wow.
That is so very illegal.

06:26.963 --> 06:28.364
He's not doing that.

06:28.365 --> 06:29.398
I don't care.

06:29.399 --> 06:33.202
You have 48 hours to do so,
or I'm gonna take your sperm,

06:33.203 --> 06:35.770
and I'm gonna dump it
into the East River.

06:35.805 --> 06:36.805
Please don't do that.

06:36.806 --> 06:38.741
And there will never be

06:38.742 --> 06:44.947
the possibility of a little pie-faced
Charles Boyle, Jr.

06:44.948 --> 06:46.447
Proud of it; It's me.

06:48.084 --> 06:49.952
She can't do that.
Can she do that?

06:49.953 --> 06:50.953
Stay calm.

06:50.954 --> 06:53.255
We're gonna talk to a lawyer
and get a professional opinion.

06:53.256 --> 06:54.657
Damn.

06:54.658 --> 06:56.659
I can't believe
you signed this contract.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.794
The sperm is her
legal possession.

06:58.795 --> 07:00.696
It also says that, she...
and I quote...

07:00.697 --> 07:02.398
"Owns your dignity."

07:02.399 --> 07:04.066
You initialed
right next to that.

07:04.067 --> 07:06.634
Oh, no, Jake,
this is a total disaster!

07:06.670 --> 07:09.305
I'll never be happy in my life.

07:09.306 --> 07:10.305
Why are you smiling?

07:10.340 --> 07:12.608
Because this is exactly
what we've trained for.

07:12.609 --> 07:14.276
It's a hostage situation,

07:14.277 --> 07:16.137
and we're gonna
bring your boys home.

07:16.874 --> 07:19.218
All right, Charles, I know
that you're freaking out

07:19.253 --> 07:20.553
and you think you're never
gonna be a father,

07:20.554 --> 07:21.821
but don't worry; There's no way

07:21.822 --> 07:24.481
I'm gonna let Eleanor do
anything to your precious...

07:24.482 --> 07:25.949
- Boyle oil?
- Ugh, all right, I'm out.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.117
She can do what she wants.

07:27.118 --> 07:28.118
No, no, no, no, no.

07:28.119 --> 07:29.352
We'll just call them hostages.

07:29.353 --> 07:31.688
All right, fine,
let's get to work.

07:31.689 --> 07:33.423
Here's what we know
about Eleanor.

07:33.424 --> 07:34.691
Oh, my wedding day.

07:34.692 --> 07:36.025
I should've known
it was a mistake

07:36.026 --> 07:37.660
when she said, "I suppose,"
instead of, "I do."

07:37.661 --> 07:38.762
Yowch, all right.

07:38.763 --> 07:40.663
Hostage taker:
Eleanor Horstweil.

07:40.664 --> 07:42.899

07:46.470 --> 07:48.605
Don't bring him into it.
We're actually quite close.

07:48.606 --> 07:50.240
Noted.
You divorced in 2010.

07:50.241 --> 07:51.941
She got the house, both cars,

07:51.942 --> 07:54.043
and 85% of your salary
going forward.

07:54.044 --> 07:55.278
That's a typo, right?

07:55.279 --> 07:57.313
- It is not.
- How did she get so much?

07:57.314 --> 07:59.182
My lawyer was Hercules.
That's how they met.

07:59.183 --> 08:00.583
That seems real unethical.

08:00.584 --> 08:02.986
Again, lay off Hercules.
He's quite a decent man.

08:02.987 --> 08:05.155
All right, look, we need
some sort of bargaining chip.

08:05.156 --> 08:07.357
Is there anything you got
in the divorce that she wanted?

08:07.358 --> 08:08.992
Yes... Abigail.

08:08.993 --> 08:11.461
I'm gonna just assume
Abigail's something super weird.

08:11.462 --> 08:13.029
Nope.
She was our hairdresser.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.030
Ah, okay.

08:14.031 --> 08:15.031
It was awkward for her

08:15.032 --> 08:16.566
to see both of us,
so she made us choose.

08:16.567 --> 08:17.934
I mean, I couldn't
get rid of her.

08:17.935 --> 08:20.370
She's the only stylist
in New York that can do this.

08:20.371 --> 08:23.440
Right, and do you think
Eleanor still wants Abigail?

08:23.441 --> 08:25.275
I mean, you saw her hair today.

08:25.276 --> 08:27.877
It's all volume, no sheen.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.113
Okay, maybe we can use this.

08:30.114 --> 08:31.981
Time to put on
our negotiation faces.

08:31.982 --> 08:34.517
Not too intimidating
but always in control.

08:34.518 --> 08:35.851
How's this?

08:37.288 --> 08:39.989
Oh, as if you don't know
it's perfect.

08:39.990 --> 08:41.789
Hey, Sergeant.

08:41.826 --> 08:42.892
How are you?

08:42.893 --> 08:44.059
Well, my baby cries

08:44.061 --> 08:46.463
at the sight of my face now,
so that's great.

08:46.464 --> 08:48.298
I mean, she's a baby;

08:48.299 --> 08:50.133
She could be crying at anything.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.902
Nope, she pointed right
at my nose and then threw up.

08:52.903 --> 08:54.838
What do you want, Santiago?

08:54.839 --> 08:56.506
I was just wondering
if you finished

08:56.507 --> 08:58.408
writing
that recommendation letter.

08:58.409 --> 08:59.909
It's due pretty soon.

08:59.910 --> 09:00.944
I'm working on it.

09:00.945 --> 09:02.078
It's taking a little while

09:02.079 --> 09:04.647
because it's hard to concentrate,
what with all the agony.

09:04.648 --> 09:07.784
Okay, well, thank you
for still doing it.

09:07.785 --> 09:10.920
If it helps, I brought you
some soothing ginger tea.

09:10.921 --> 09:13.856
Will it repair the place
where my nose came off my skull?

09:13.891 --> 09:17.227
I don't know, but it's supposed
to have healing vapors.

09:17.228 --> 09:19.062
So try inhaling it?

09:19.063 --> 09:21.597
Oh, thank you.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.301
It burns!

09:25.302 --> 09:26.636
- Oh!
- The vapors burn!

09:26.637 --> 09:28.505
I'm sorry! I'll take it back!

09:28.506 --> 09:31.106
Oh, God, I'm sorry!
I'll get some cold water!

09:31.141 --> 09:33.209
No, no, don't.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.712
I am petrified of you!

09:35.713 --> 09:38.715
All right, remember,
this is a negotiation.

09:38.716 --> 09:40.617
We can't let her know
how badly you want this.

09:40.618 --> 09:41.985
Jake, what if
she destroys the sperm?

09:41.986 --> 09:43.620
She's not gonna
do that, Charles,

09:43.621 --> 09:45.288
because then
she'd have no leverage.

09:45.289 --> 09:48.224
All right, you know this;
They never shoot the hostage.

09:48.225 --> 09:49.659
Hey!

09:49.660 --> 09:51.928
Did you threaten
that 90-year-old man for me yet?

09:51.929 --> 09:54.030
What?
The guy you hit was 90?

09:54.031 --> 09:56.199
Yeah, and you would know
that if you had talked to him,

09:56.200 --> 09:58.001
which obviously you did not,
so good-bye!

09:58.002 --> 09:59.469
No, no, wait, wait, look.

09:59.470 --> 10:01.137
We can't help you out
until we know that

10:01.138 --> 10:03.306
you actually have the samples.

10:03.307 --> 10:04.874
We need proof of life.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.042
I'd be happy to dump

10:06.043 --> 10:07.644
one of the containers
out of the window.

10:07.645 --> 10:09.045
No, no, no, don't do that,
please!

10:09.046 --> 10:10.547
Don't dumb my sperm on us!

10:10.548 --> 10:12.982
Hello, ma'am.
Top of the morning to you.

10:12.983 --> 10:15.317
All right, look,
if you let us upstairs...

10:16.420 --> 10:17.920
We'll give you Abigail.

10:20.257 --> 10:21.558
I'll buzz you in.

10:21.559 --> 10:23.626
And that is how it's done.

10:23.627 --> 10:25.628
Like taking candy from a baby.

10:25.629 --> 10:27.430
Why would you bring up
babies right now?

10:27.431 --> 10:30.266
- It's a saying.
- Who would do that?

10:30.267 --> 10:32.936
The question is, why would someone
want to talk to Gina?

10:32.937 --> 10:34.037
That's very rude.

10:34.038 --> 10:35.271
It's obvious
why the guy wants to talk

10:35.272 --> 10:36.806
to a civilian like her;
He's stalling.

10:36.807 --> 10:38.007
That's also rude.

10:38.008 --> 10:39.609
Maybe he wants to talk
to a normal person

10:39.610 --> 10:41.511
instead of two rude cops.

10:41.512 --> 10:43.613
Well, whatever his reason,
we have no other choice.

10:43.614 --> 10:44.948
Gina take his statement.

10:44.949 --> 10:46.349
Yes, thank you!

10:46.350 --> 10:47.584
I'm gonna get this guy to admit

10:47.585 --> 10:49.152
to crimes he hasn't
even committed.

10:49.153 --> 10:51.254
No, that would be
a huge problem.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.522
Copy that.

10:52.523 --> 10:54.023
We'll get you a file on him
so you can study up.

10:54.024 --> 10:56.025
That won't be necessary.
I'm gonna go with my gut.

10:56.026 --> 10:57.427
He asked for Gina.

10:57.428 --> 10:59.728
Let's give the people
what they want.

11:04.068 --> 11:06.202
Steven, Steven, Steven...

11:06.203 --> 11:07.569
You mind if I take a seat?

11:07.605 --> 11:09.271
Go for it.

11:10.441 --> 11:11.441
Oh, boy.

11:11.442 --> 11:12.942
Look, I'm not a cop.

11:12.943 --> 11:14.744
I don't really like cops.

11:14.745 --> 11:17.880
Honestly, I think
crime's kind of cool.

11:17.915 --> 11:20.182
- Okay.
- Yeah, you get it.

11:20.217 --> 11:22.051
Are we still holding out hope
that this might work?

11:22.052 --> 11:23.752
I am.
Let's give her a shot.

11:23.787 --> 11:26.256
I feel like you and me
are really bonding.

11:26.257 --> 11:27.724
I'm ready to give you immunity.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.291
<i>No, you're not.
That's not happening!</i>

11:29.326 --> 11:30.425
Gina, come out of there.

11:30.461 --> 11:31.594
Negative.

11:31.595 --> 11:34.230
The guy wanted to talk
to a real person, not a cop.

11:34.231 --> 11:35.697
That's why he asked for me.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.400
Actually, I asked for you

11:37.401 --> 11:39.368
because we went
to high school together.

11:39.403 --> 11:41.104
- What?
- Steven Henderson.

11:41.105 --> 11:43.106
We had a bunch
of classes together.

11:43.107 --> 11:45.942
Steven Henderson...
we made out once on the bus.

11:45.943 --> 11:48.477
I mean...
do you not remember me?

11:48.512 --> 11:51.313
Uh...

11:53.250 --> 11:54.249
Eleanor.

11:54.251 --> 11:55.250
Jake.

11:55.286 --> 11:56.585
Charles.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.953
Okay, you just
said your own name, bud.

11:57.988 --> 11:59.288
It was the only one left.

11:59.323 --> 12:02.492
Okay, so we have
given you Abigail.

12:02.493 --> 12:03.660
Now it's time for you

12:03.661 --> 12:05.361
to make good
on your side of the deal,

12:05.362 --> 12:07.363
and... I can't believe
I'm saying this...

12:07.364 --> 12:09.465
show us Charles' sperm.

12:09.466 --> 12:10.999
It's my sperm.

12:11.035 --> 12:12.201
It's in the freezer.

12:12.202 --> 12:14.036
I'll be right back.

12:14.071 --> 12:15.672
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

12:15.673 --> 12:17.339
Abigail was our only
bargaining chip.

12:17.374 --> 12:18.608
Don't worry.
I have a plan.

12:18.609 --> 12:19.976
As soon
as she comes back in here,

12:19.977 --> 12:21.311
I'm gonna grab that cup
right out of her hands

12:21.312 --> 12:22.311
and run like hell.

12:22.313 --> 12:23.313
You think that'll work?

12:23.314 --> 12:24.547
I don't just think it will.

12:24.548 --> 12:26.348
I know it might.

12:26.383 --> 12:29.585
Here it is... cold and sad.
Just like you.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.454
How do I know
that that's really Charles'?

12:31.455 --> 12:33.990
I'm gonna have to read
the label up close.

12:33.991 --> 12:35.757
If I could just take
a look...

12:35.793 --> 12:38.260
Go, Boyle!

12:38.295 --> 12:40.162
You really think
I'm that stupid?

12:40.197 --> 12:44.801
It's called a dummy cup,
dummies.

12:44.802 --> 12:46.669
Damn it.
She's right; It's empty.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.271
- Oh...
- I'm actually kind of relieved.

12:48.272 --> 12:49.538
I did not want to see that.

12:49.573 --> 12:51.373
You two are messing with
the wrong woman.

12:51.408 --> 12:53.609
And now you're gonna pay for it.

12:53.644 --> 12:55.010
- Wait, wait!
- Eleanor, Eleanor!

12:55.045 --> 12:57.346
There are two real containers.

12:57.381 --> 13:01.718
One is in a safe location,
and this is the other one.

13:01.719 --> 13:05.555
Or rather, it <i> was</i> the other one.

13:06.557 --> 13:07.556
No!

13:09.927 --> 13:11.593
She shot a hostage.

13:13.912 --> 13:15.880
Charles, what are you doing?

13:15.881 --> 13:17.949
I'm sorry, but I don't
have a choice, Jake.

13:17.950 --> 13:19.283
I'm gonna go bully an old priest

13:19.284 --> 13:20.984
so I can get my sperms back.

13:21.019 --> 13:22.186
He's a priest?

13:22.187 --> 13:23.521
Yeah, I looked him up.

13:23.522 --> 13:26.324
He's a priest,
a 90-year-old priest.

13:26.325 --> 13:28.158
But don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt him.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.093
I'm just gonna casually yawn...

13:31.763 --> 13:33.997
Thereby exposing
my gun and badge.

13:34.032 --> 13:36.399
Listen, you can't do this,
Charles; It's illegal.

13:36.435 --> 13:37.435
I have to.

13:37.436 --> 13:39.470
You saw what Eleanor did
to millions of my babies.

13:39.471 --> 13:40.771
I heard them scream!

13:40.772 --> 13:41.771
That was you.

13:41.807 --> 13:43.941
I am them, and they are me.

13:43.942 --> 13:46.276
You could go to prison, okay?

13:47.546 --> 13:49.146
You're right.
You're right.

13:49.147 --> 13:50.681
What am I thinking?

13:50.682 --> 13:52.817
Thank you
for looking out for me...

13:52.818 --> 13:54.451
- Yeah.
- Friend.

13:55.487 --> 13:56.721
No!
What...

13:56.722 --> 13:57.889
oh, Charles, what are you doing?

13:57.890 --> 14:00.391
No, no, no, no, no!
Not the keys, no!

14:00.392 --> 14:02.026
Oh, I should've known.

14:02.027 --> 14:03.828
You're a hugger, not a shaker.

14:03.829 --> 14:05.595
It was the most painful thing
I've ever done,

14:05.631 --> 14:08.198
and I've taken three of
my grandparents off life support.

14:08.233 --> 14:09.934
How are you
always in charge of that?

14:09.935 --> 14:12.136
Wait, Charles,
do not get in that car!

14:12.137 --> 14:13.503
- He's getting in the car.
- Sorry.

14:13.538 --> 14:14.772
Don't you drive away!

14:14.773 --> 14:15.973
He's driving away.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.375
Charles!

14:19.611 --> 14:21.812
I just got
an email from SAM-SAM.

14:21.813 --> 14:23.814
Rejected?

14:23.815 --> 14:25.649
I've never been rejected
from anything.

14:25.684 --> 14:26.751
Me neither.

14:26.752 --> 14:29.086
Oops, did you say
rejected or ejected?

14:29.087 --> 14:30.487
I've been rejected a lot.

14:30.522 --> 14:31.822
I don't understand.

14:31.823 --> 14:33.857
My application was so good.

14:33.892 --> 14:36.326
You know what?
I've also been ejected.

14:36.361 --> 14:38.461
Flume ride, Topeka, Kansas.

14:38.497 --> 14:39.529
How did this happen?

14:39.564 --> 14:41.599
Just forgot to put on the belt.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.732
Jeffords.

14:42.768 --> 14:44.134
Good talk, Ames.

14:48.173 --> 14:49.607
You wrote me
a bad recommendation.

14:49.608 --> 14:50.841
How could you?

14:50.842 --> 14:53.176
- Excuse me?
- It's the only explanation!

14:53.211 --> 14:54.712
You're mad
that I broke your face

14:54.713 --> 14:56.213
and I burned your whole body.

14:56.214 --> 14:58.181
Well, grow up!

14:58.216 --> 15:00.451
Grow up?

15:00.452 --> 15:02.720
I have a Roth IRA!

15:02.721 --> 15:04.854
I eat wheat toast!
You grow up!

15:04.890 --> 15:06.357
You know what?

15:06.358 --> 15:09.193
Here's the letter that I sent.

15:09.194 --> 15:11.662
"Amy Santiago is one
of the finest detectives

15:11.663 --> 15:15.398
in my precinct...
nay, the entire NYPD."

15:15.434 --> 15:17.767
Yeah, I even
used the word "nay."

15:17.803 --> 15:23.808
The idea that you would
question my integrity is so...

15:23.809 --> 15:27.311
Uh-oh, I got to sneeze.
This is gonna hurt!

15:27.312 --> 15:28.913
Oh, oh, God.

15:32.317 --> 15:33.884
Oh, Hitchcock, thank God!

15:33.885 --> 15:35.553
Handcuffed yourself to a car?

15:35.554 --> 15:36.553
Been there.

15:36.588 --> 15:38.322
What?
No, Charles did this.

15:38.323 --> 15:40.924
Here, quick, hand me those keys.

15:40.959 --> 15:42.326
Here we go.

15:42.327 --> 15:43.593
What will you give me for them?

15:43.628 --> 15:45.595
Seriously?
What do you want?

15:45.630 --> 15:47.630
A dollar for a soda;
Mine are all wet.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.299
Yes, obviously,
I'll give you that!

15:49.334 --> 15:50.334
Bam!

15:50.335 --> 15:53.103
A soda only costs 75¢, you fool.

15:53.138 --> 15:55.305
See you later, sucker!

15:55.340 --> 15:57.007
Didn't even give him the dollar.

15:58.143 --> 15:59.642
I know it seems like I blew it,

15:59.678 --> 16:01.711
but you got to give me
another crack at him.

16:01.747 --> 16:04.280
Now that I'm aware
of our fascinating past,

16:04.316 --> 16:05.816
I have all the ammo that I need.

16:05.817 --> 16:07.284
Perhaps you would've
had that ammo

16:07.285 --> 16:08.952
if you had read the file
Diaz offered you.

16:08.987 --> 16:11.554
No doubt. No doubt.
Gina culpa.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.957
Okay, you get one more chance.

16:13.992 --> 16:16.259
I will not let you down.

16:16.294 --> 16:21.098
Steven, Steven, Steven,
I have one question.

16:21.099 --> 16:22.833
Who on the basketball team
was into me?

16:22.834 --> 16:24.201
I want names.

16:24.202 --> 16:25.436
What?

16:25.437 --> 16:27.104
We don't have time
to play games, Steven.

16:27.105 --> 16:28.272
That's it.
I'm pulling her.

16:28.273 --> 16:30.041
No, no, let her keep going.

16:30.042 --> 16:31.674
<i>Question two...</i>

16:31.710 --> 16:34.177
Who on the lacrosse team
is into me,

16:34.212 --> 16:36.646
and which one them
aged the best?

16:36.681 --> 16:38.015
<i>♪ A whole lot of woman... ♪</i>

16:39.184 --> 16:40.684
<i>♪ A whole lot of... ♪</i>

16:40.685 --> 16:43.587
<i>In 4,000 feet, stay straight.</i>

16:43.588 --> 16:45.489
You interrupted
the song for that?

16:45.490 --> 16:47.891
<i>♪
♪</i>

16:48.827 --> 16:49.827
Hello.

16:49.828 --> 16:53.497
Father, I understand you
were recently involved

16:53.498 --> 16:56.599
in an automobile accident
with an Eleanor Horstweil.

16:56.635 --> 17:00.671
Oh, yes, uh,
she came up onto the sidewalk

17:00.672 --> 17:02.806
and fractured my hip.

17:02.841 --> 17:04.707
You were a pedestrian?

17:04.742 --> 17:07.144
Are you technically a pedestrian

17:07.145 --> 17:09.212
if you're sitting on a bench?

17:09.247 --> 17:10.580
Sitting on a bench...

17:10.582 --> 17:12.583
Well, okay,
I don't want to tell you

17:12.584 --> 17:19.924
to drop your suit against her,
but I sure am getting sleepy.

17:19.925 --> 17:22.093
Excuse me?

17:22.094 --> 17:24.962
Yawns a-coming.

17:26.832 --> 17:28.332
I got you.

17:28.333 --> 17:29.400
Hi there.
I'm Jake.

17:29.401 --> 17:30.801
This is my best friend, Charles.

17:30.802 --> 17:32.335
He's trying to have a baby.
You get it.

17:32.370 --> 17:33.636
Now, come here, you.

17:38.239 --> 17:41.440
Charles, I know you're mad,
but you have to talk to me.

17:41.476 --> 17:43.076
It's funny how
getting tased in the back

17:43.077 --> 17:46.245
can break your heart and also
really hurt your back.

17:46.281 --> 17:47.781
I'm sorry.

17:47.782 --> 17:50.384
I really wanted to be
a papa, and you ruined it.

17:50.385 --> 17:51.685
You pop-blocked me.

17:51.686 --> 17:54.021
I know, but I couldn't
let you break the law.

17:54.022 --> 17:56.422
And I won't let Eleanor
turn you into a bad person.

17:56.457 --> 17:57.990
What other choice do I have?

17:58.026 --> 18:00.694
There's always a choice, Charles

18:00.695 --> 18:03.197
And by the way,
DNA is not the only thing

18:03.198 --> 18:04.965
that makes somebody
into a father.

18:04.966 --> 18:06.633
I mean,
not that it's any of my business,

18:06.634 --> 18:09.435
but I have biological father,
and he's a nightmare.

18:09.470 --> 18:10.770
He never played catch with me.

18:10.805 --> 18:12.239
He never taught me
how to ride a bike.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.173
I had to learn how to shave
from watching "Home Alone."

18:14.209 --> 18:16.043
Makes sense; It's like
"Die Hard" for kids.

18:16.044 --> 18:18.178
Plus, is this how
you really want it to go?

18:18.179 --> 18:21.215
Eleanor controlling your life,
ruining your career?

18:21.216 --> 18:22.315
So what do I do?

18:22.350 --> 18:24.016
Honestly, I don't know.

18:24.052 --> 18:26.153
But I do know that you're
gonna be a great dad

18:26.154 --> 18:27.787
with or without your...

18:27.822 --> 18:30.057
- Boyle oil.
- Nope, not gonna say it.

18:30.058 --> 18:31.458
But you will.

18:31.459 --> 18:34.194
There's still time left
on Eleanor's deadline.

18:34.195 --> 18:35.862
I'm gonna unlock this door.

18:35.863 --> 18:37.430
You do what you got to do.

18:42.070 --> 18:43.436
That seems like a bad sign.

18:43.471 --> 18:47.039
Hey, Santiago, you know why
you didn't get into SAM-SAM?

18:47.075 --> 18:50.010
Probably because I used a modern
format on my cover letter

18:50.011 --> 18:52.479
that put my email above
my home address.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.213
Why take such a risk?

18:54.249 --> 18:58.017
No, I sent the recommendation
letter to the wrong place.

18:58.052 --> 19:00.786
I thought you were applying
to be a mentor, not a mentee.

19:00.822 --> 19:03.357
You thought I wanted
to be a SAM, not a SAM?

19:03.358 --> 19:04.523
Are you insane?

19:04.559 --> 19:05.958
Well, you should be a SAM.

19:05.994 --> 19:07.526
No, I should be a SAM.

19:07.562 --> 19:09.463
We got to start saying
something other than SAM

19:09.464 --> 19:11.564
because we are barreling
toward a misunderstanding.

19:11.599 --> 19:14.935
Amy, you are ready
to be teaching others.

19:14.936 --> 19:17.403
I made a call;
You're going to be a mentor.

19:17.438 --> 19:19.940
Oh, my God...

19:19.941 --> 19:21.508
Sergeant, I'm so sorry

19:21.509 --> 19:23.043
for ever questioning
your integrity.

19:23.044 --> 19:24.044
Thank you so much...

19:24.045 --> 19:25.244
No, no, no, stand back.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.313
Look, I'm still
very scared of you.

19:27.348 --> 19:30.049
Good news.
I got Steven to talk.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.718
Diaz, fantastic.
How did you do it?

19:31.719 --> 19:34.454
Did you finally show him
the municipal court website

19:34.455 --> 19:36.188
and the pulldown menus
you can't click on?

19:36.224 --> 19:38.659
No, I found something
we bonded over.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.794
She didn't even know who I was.

19:40.795 --> 19:42.396
And we were good friends.

19:42.397 --> 19:44.398
On more than one occasion,
she's called me Gina.

19:44.399 --> 19:46.066
That's her own name.

19:46.067 --> 19:47.267
No, she didn't.

19:47.268 --> 19:49.102
We complained about
Gina for an hour,

19:49.103 --> 19:50.871
and then he opened up...
gave me the name

19:50.872 --> 19:52.339
of the guy he works for.

19:52.340 --> 19:56.677
I have never been
so insulted in my entire life.

19:56.678 --> 19:58.945
I'm not gonna work cases
for you guys anymore.

19:58.946 --> 20:00.547
We were never
going to ask you to.

20:02.417 --> 20:05.017
You just lost
your best detective.

20:09.123 --> 20:11.258
Charles, thank God.
What happened?

20:11.259 --> 20:12.592
- I did it.
- Did what?

20:12.593 --> 20:14.628
I'm freaking out over here;
You stormed off.

20:14.629 --> 20:16.463
Yeah, because
I was inspired by you.

20:16.464 --> 20:18.965
I ran all the way to
Eleanor's house to tell her off.

20:18.966 --> 20:20.133
What do you want, Chunk?

20:20.134 --> 20:22.669
To let you know
you can keep my sperm.

20:22.670 --> 20:24.137
I don't need it.

20:24.138 --> 20:26.306
I'm in love
and I'm going to be a dad,

20:26.307 --> 20:28.442
and there's nothing
you could do to stop me.

20:28.443 --> 20:29.676
So good-bye forever.

20:29.677 --> 20:31.178
Oh, and one more thing...

20:31.179 --> 20:33.280
tell Hercules I'll see him
at spin class on Sunday.

20:33.281 --> 20:34.514
Now good-bye!

20:34.515 --> 20:35.816
- How do you guys feel?
- Great.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.818
We were looking at
possible donors on the way over.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Check out this guy.

20:40.321 --> 20:41.822
I like him; He want to Yale.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.590
Oh, wait, that says
"Yeal University."

20:43.591 --> 20:44.758
Swipe him off.

20:44.759 --> 20:46.293
This is fun...
oh, that's weird.

20:46.294 --> 20:47.761
That guy kind of looks
like my dad.

20:47.762 --> 20:49.763
Wait a minute.
That is my dad.

20:49.764 --> 20:51.098
You cannot use his sperm.

20:51.099 --> 20:52.299
You cannot use his sperm.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.592
My son would be your brother!
