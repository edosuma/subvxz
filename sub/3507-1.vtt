01:47.058 --> 01:48.447
Who are you?

01:51.077 --> 01:52.700
Alison Tisdale--

01:52.879 --> 01:55.490
24, grad student at N.Y.U.,

01:55.490 --> 01:57.238
Part of the social work program.

01:57.273 --> 01:58.899
Nice place for a social worker.

01:58.899 --> 02:00.203
Daddy's money.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.194
Neighbors called to
complain about the MUC.

02:02.194 --> 02:04.298
When she didn't answer, they
had the super check on her.

02:04.735 --> 02:06.359
No signs of struggle.

02:08.801 --> 02:09.935
He knew her.

02:09.935 --> 02:11.451
Even bought her flowers.

02:11.451 --> 02:13.286
Who says romance is dead?

02:13.286 --> 02:15.314
I do, every Saturday night.

02:15.314 --> 02:16.899
A little lipstick wouldn't hurt.

02:17.828 --> 02:19.162
I'm just saying.

02:19.162 --> 02:21.051
So what'd he give her besides roses?

02:22.211 --> 02:24.615
Two shots to the chest,

02:24.615 --> 02:25.870
Small caliber.

02:32.045 --> 02:33.889
Does this look familiar to anyone?

02:34.023 --> 02:37.570
No, but I'm not the one
with a thing for freaky ones.

02:37.570 --> 02:39.581
Just give me a "Jack
shot Jill over Bill"

02:39.581 --> 02:41.228
So I can get my collar and go home.

02:41.377 --> 02:43.554
Oh, but the freaky ones require more.

02:43.646 --> 02:45.107
They reveal more.

02:45.107 --> 02:49.001
Look at how he left
her, covered modestly.

02:49.179 --> 02:50.034
So?

02:50.034 --> 02:52.808
So despite all of the effort,
all of the preparation,

02:52.808 --> 02:55.090
You won't find any
evidence of sexual abuse.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.982
You really get that from just this?

02:56.982 --> 02:59.410
This, plus, I've seen this before.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.737
You've seen it before? Where?

03:01.843 --> 03:04.795
Roses on her body,
sunflowers on her eyes?

03:08.899 --> 03:10.361
Don't you guys read?

03:11.630 --> 03:15.186
What kind of idiot kills off
his best-selling main character?

03:15.186 --> 03:17.507
Are you asking as my
bloodsucking publisher

03:17.507 --> 03:19.278
Or as my bloodsucking ex-wife?

03:19.278 --> 03:20.687
Oh, is that what you're doing?

03:20.687 --> 03:22.529
Punishg me by killing the golden goose?

03:22.529 --> 03:24.626
Oh, come on. I may be
petty and shortsighted,

03:24.626 --> 03:26.187
But I'm not that petty and shortsighted.

03:26.187 --> 03:27.609
Really? Then why?

03:27.806 --> 03:29.591
Writing Derrick used to be fun.

03:29.591 --> 03:30.726
Now it's like work.

03:30.726 --> 03:32.409
Mm. God forbid you should work.

03:32.409 --> 03:33.594
I mean, you could have retired him,

03:33.594 --> 03:34.542
You could have crippled him.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.618
You could have had him
join the friggin' circus.

03:36.618 --> 03:39.918
But, no, you had to put
a bullet through his head.

03:39.918 --> 03:42.922
Yeah, real messy, too. Big exit wound.

03:42.922 --> 03:47.024
Don't worry. Derrick Storm is
not the golden goose here. I am.

03:47.289 --> 03:49.075
I wrote half a dozen
best sellers before him.

03:49.075 --> 03:50.559
What makes you think I'm gonna stop now?

03:50.559 --> 03:53.342
Oh, I don't know. The fact the
new book was due nine weeks ago?

03:53.342 --> 03:54.508
You can't rush genius.

03:54.508 --> 03:57.016
Genius, richard? Try blockage.

03:57.016 --> 03:58.974
I heard you haven't written in months.

03:59.922 --> 04:00.972
That's ridiculous.

04:00.972 --> 04:02.634
My sources are very reliable.

04:02.634 --> 04:03.359
Well, they're wrong.

04:03.359 --> 04:04.370
They better be.

04:04.370 --> 04:07.506
If I don't have a new muscript On
my desk in the next three weeks,

04:07.506 --> 04:10.390
Black pawn is prepared to demand
the return of your advance.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.451
You wouldn't dare.

04:11.451 --> 04:14.211
Try me. Just try me.

04:14.934 --> 04:17.349
You know, I already
returned that advance.

04:17.659 --> 04:19.442
I spent it divorcing you.

04:23.302 --> 04:26.547
Really, dollface, who
does homework at a party?

04:26.547 --> 04:27.729
I have a test next week.

04:27.729 --> 04:31.162
So do I-- Liver function.
You don't see me studying.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.298
All right, give me a hit of the bubbly.

04:33.298 --> 04:34.052
Make that two.

04:34.052 --> 04:36.272
Hey, kiddo. Sales must be slipping.

04:36.272 --> 04:38.109
They're only serving the soft stuff.

04:39.025 --> 04:40.039
Hey, dad.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.991
Hey, sweetie. So, mother...

04:42.991 --> 04:45.795
Shh! Shh! Shh! Not so loud.
I'm still hoping to get lucky.

04:45.795 --> 04:47.489
Did you tell gina I was
having trouble writing?

04:47.489 --> 04:49.815
Oh, I told her nothing of the sort. I...

04:51.825 --> 04:55.847
I may have said something
About spending your days

04:55.847 --> 04:58.490
moping in your underwear
Waiting for post time at belmont.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.062
But hey, you're an
artist. It's expected.

05:01.062 --> 05:02.010
We had aeal.

05:02.010 --> 05:04.230
I let you live with us, but
you don't talk about my work.

05:04.230 --> 05:05.808
What's to talk about?
You haven't done any

05:05.808 --> 05:06.850
- since I moved in.
- Gram.

05:06.850 --> 05:10.479
- Well, he hasn't.
- Whatever I have and haven't done,

05:10.479 --> 05:13.237
I would just appreciate it if you
wouldn't share it with my ex-wife.

05:13.237 --> 05:14.820
Oh, what's the big deal?

05:15.754 --> 05:17.883
Hang on, sweetie. I just
got a hit on my "graydar."

05:18.622 --> 05:21.362
Bingo! No ring. Stand back, ki.

05:21.362 --> 05:22.795
Mama's going fishing.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.246
You should have me committed.

05:26.392 --> 05:28.039
For what, letting her move in?

05:28.155 --> 05:29.078
I think it's sweet.

05:29.078 --> 05:30.436
Won't be when I strangle her.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.759
You know I'm only 15, right?

05:33.759 --> 05:34.796
You're an old soul.

05:34.796 --> 05:37.492
Yeah, well, me and my "soul" can wait.

05:37.742 --> 05:39.231
When I was your age...

05:40.034 --> 05:41.222
I can't tell that story.

05:41.222 --> 05:43.807
It's wildly inappropriate,
which, oddly, is my point.

05:43.807 --> 05:46.018
Don't you want to have
wildly inappropriate stories

05:46.018 --> 05:47.150
That you can't tell your children?

05:47.150 --> 05:48.834
I think you have enough of
those for the both of us.

05:48.834 --> 05:50.218
Life should be an adventure.

05:50.218 --> 05:52.410
You want to know why I killed Derrick?

05:52.410 --> 05:54.035
There were no more surprises.

05:54.035 --> 05:57.010
I knew exactly What was going to
happen every moment of every scene.

05:57.010 --> 06:00.199
It's just like these parties.
They've become so predictable.

06:00.306 --> 06:03.474
"I'm your biggest fan.
Where do you get your ideas?"

06:03.474 --> 06:06.030
And the ever popular
"will you sign my 'chest'?"

06:06.030 --> 06:07.406
That one I don't mind so much.

06:07.406 --> 06:09.371
Yeah, well, F.Y.I., I do.

06:09.371 --> 06:12.243
Just once, I'd like someone to
come up to me and say something new.

06:12.243 --> 06:13.518
Mr. Castle?

06:14.346 --> 06:15.543
Where would you like it?

06:15.830 --> 06:18.170
Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.703
We need to ask you a few questions

06:19.703 --> 06:21.872
About a murder that took
place earlier tonight.

06:22.074 --> 06:23.138
That's new.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.606
S01E01:
Pilot.

06:34.707 --> 06:36.083
Mr. Castle.

06:36.330 --> 06:39.395
You've got quite a rap sheet
for a best-selling author.

06:39.504 --> 06:41.091
Disorderly conduct,

06:41.091 --> 06:42.675
Uh, resisting arrest?

06:42.923 --> 06:44.560
Boys will be boys.

06:45.632 --> 06:48.095
It says here that you
stole a police horse?

06:48.095 --> 06:48.755
Borrowed.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.743
Ah. And you were nude at the time.

06:51.743 --> 06:52.646
It was spring.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.078
And every time, the
charges were dropped.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.867
What can I say?

06:57.223 --> 06:58.483
The mayor is a fan.

06:58.483 --> 07:00.050
But if it makes you feel any better,

07:00.050 --> 07:02.296
I'd be happy to let you spank me.

07:03.599 --> 07:07.323
Mr. Castle, this whole "bad boy
charm" thing that you've got going

07:07.323 --> 07:09.910
Might work for bimbettes
and celebutantes.

07:09.910 --> 07:11.930
Me? I work for a living,

07:11.930 --> 07:14.090
So that makes you one of
two things in my world--

07:14.090 --> 07:15.871
Either the guy who makes my life easier

07:15.871 --> 07:17.190
Or the guy who makes my life harder.

07:17.190 --> 07:20.095
And trust me, you do not want to
be the guy who makes my life harder.

07:20.095 --> 07:21.163
Okay.

07:23.130 --> 07:24.390
Alison Tisdale,

07:24.390 --> 07:26.510
Daughter of real estate
mogul Jonathan Tisdale.

07:26.510 --> 07:27.843
- She's cute.
- She's dead.

07:27.843 --> 07:30.458
Did you ever meet her?
Book signing? Charity event?

07:30.458 --> 07:33.147
It's possible. She's not
in my little black book,

07:33.147 --> 07:34.304
If that's what you're asking.

07:34.559 --> 07:35.870
What about this guy?

07:36.347 --> 07:38.999
Marvin Fisk, small claims lawyer.

07:38.999 --> 07:43.019
Most of my claims tend to
be on the, um, large side.

07:43.661 --> 07:44.943
So what's this got to do with me?

07:44.943 --> 07:48.074
Fisk was found murdered in
his office two weeks ago.

07:48.074 --> 07:51.795
I didn't put it together until we
saw the Tisdale crime scene tonight.

07:52.911 --> 07:54.522
"Flowers for your grave."

07:54.522 --> 07:56.703
And this is how we found Marvin Fisk,

07:56.703 --> 07:58.876
Right out of "hell hath no fury."

07:59.488 --> 08:00.782
Looks like I have a fan.

08:00.782 --> 08:02.503
Yeah, a really deranged fan.

08:02.503 --> 08:04.335
Oh, you don't look deranged to me.

08:04.434 --> 08:05.425
What?

08:06.414 --> 08:08.043
"Hell hath no fury"--

08:08.043 --> 08:09.795
Angry wiccans out for blood.

08:09.795 --> 08:13.463
Come on. Only hard-core
Castle groupies read that one.

08:13.463 --> 08:16.519
Do any of these groupies
ever write you letters?

08:17.436 --> 08:18.607
Disturbing letters?

08:18.607 --> 08:20.011
Oh, all my fan mail is disturbing.

08:20.011 --> 08:21.264
It's an occupational hazard.

08:21.264 --> 08:24.059
Because sometimes in cases
like this, we find that the

08:24.059 --> 08:25.338
- killer attempts to--
- Killer attempts

08:25.339 --> 08:26.617
to contact the subject
of his obsession.

08:26.882 --> 08:30.274
I'm also pretty well-versed
in psychopathic methodologies.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.582
Another occupational hazard.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.904
And do you know you have gorgeous eyes?

08:36.464 --> 08:39.583
So I take it that you won't have any
objection To us going through your mail?

08:39.583 --> 08:40.879
Knock yourself out.

08:41.082 --> 08:43.335
Can I get copies of those?

08:43.554 --> 08:44.302
Copies?

08:44.302 --> 08:46.678
I have this poker game.
It's mostly other writers--

08:46.678 --> 08:48.454
Patterson, Cannell--
You know, best-sellers.

08:48.454 --> 08:50.726
You have no idea how jealous
those would make them.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.938
- Jealous?
- That I have a copycat.

08:53.215 --> 08:55.598
Oh, my gosh. In my world,
that's the red badge of honor.

08:55.598 --> 08:57.158
That's the criminal cooperstown.

08:57.812 --> 09:00.147
People are dead, Mr. Castle.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.974
I'm not asking for the
bodies, just the pictures.

09:05.389 --> 09:06.839
I think we're done here.

09:19.231 --> 09:22.682
* I'm just a gal who cain't say no *

09:22.682 --> 09:25.739
* I'm in a terrible fix *

09:25.739 --> 09:29.511
* I always say, "come on, let's go" *

09:29.511 --> 09:31.044
* just when
I ought to-- *

09:31.044 --> 09:33.135
Hey, kiddo!

09:33.135 --> 09:36.725
I'm just showing Burt here
how we did it at the palace.

09:37.346 --> 09:38.962
Does he know it's your theme song?

09:41.023 --> 09:42.338
Ready to bring it home, ducky?

09:42.338 --> 09:43.511
Hey! Yes!

09:43.511 --> 09:45.488
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:45.488 --> 09:49.625
* I'm just a fool when
lights are low... *

09:49.905 --> 09:51.495
You're missing the late show.

09:51.644 --> 09:53.010
I saw it in previews.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.593
Looks like we got a new lead.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.635
His name is Burt. He does magic.

09:56.635 --> 09:57.558
- Wow.
- Yeah.

09:57.558 --> 09:58.982
Let's hope he disappears by morning.

09:59.562 --> 10:02.694
C'est apres minuit dans une school night.
Don't you turn into a pumpkin or something?

10:02.694 --> 10:04.943
Not when your dad's been
escorted away by cops.

10:04.943 --> 10:07.434
How was the slammer?
Anyone make you their bitch?

10:07.785 --> 10:10.703
Sorry, switchblade. Still
belong to you. Baby bird?

10:10.703 --> 10:12.263
- I already brushed.
- Your loss.

10:14.258 --> 10:18.522
So are you gonna tell me about it or do
I have to look it up on the fan sites?

10:18.522 --> 10:21.083
No, we had a deal. Surf
all the internet you want,

10:21.083 --> 10:22.667
Stay off the fan sites.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.226
Seriously, dad, are you
in some kind of trouble?

10:24.226 --> 10:25.994
Despite my best efforts, no.

10:26.371 --> 10:27.922
They want my help on a case.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.066
A case?

10:30.178 --> 10:33.768
Apparently, someone's been killing
people the way I kill them in my books.

10:33.768 --> 10:35.749
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

10:36.091 --> 10:37.002
How many?

10:37.002 --> 10:38.642
Two so far.

10:39.370 --> 10:40.377
Are you okay?

10:40.377 --> 10:43.704
Yeah. It's just so senseless.

10:44.026 --> 10:45.619
Murder usually is.

10:45.619 --> 10:48.662
No, murder usually makes
a great deal of sense--

10:48.662 --> 10:50.619
Passion, greed, politics.

10:50.975 --> 10:54.731
What's senseless here Is the
books that the killer chose.

10:54.731 --> 10:56.574
"Hell hath no fury,"

10:56.938 --> 10:58.720
"Flowers for
your grave"--

10:58.720 --> 11:00.416
My truly lesser works.

11:00.691 --> 11:02.442
Why would a psychotic fan pick those?

11:02.490 --> 11:04.501
Maybe because he's psychotic.

11:04.809 --> 11:07.123
Come on. It's bedtime.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.818
You can figure it out in the morning.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.699
- What are those?
- Castle's greatest hits.

11:16.158 --> 11:18.020
You're gonna familiarize
yourselves with all

11:18.021 --> 11:19.883
of his murder scenes,
so we don't miss any.

11:19.883 --> 11:21.142
Got any on tape?

11:22.043 --> 11:24.359
First victim--
Male lawyer.

11:24.359 --> 11:28.044
Second victim--
Female social worker.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.482
Somewhere in these books,
those two are connected.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.762
"From the library of
Katherine Beckett."

11:34.510 --> 11:36.330
Do you have a problem
with reading, ryan?

11:36.330 --> 11:37.806
Yo, check it, girl.
You're totally a fan.

11:37.806 --> 11:39.418
Right, of the genre.

11:39.418 --> 11:41.983
Right, the--The genre.
That's why you're blushing.

11:42.491 --> 11:44.044
What are you, 12?

11:44.079 --> 11:46.459
Profiling indicates a
perp with low intelligence,

11:46.459 --> 11:50.190
Someone who has or thinks he has a
personal relationship with our author.

11:50.190 --> 11:51.202
So that's where we start.

12:00.714 --> 12:01.578
What?

12:02.007 --> 12:03.950
I work dead bodies all day.

12:04.427 --> 12:06.747
The last thing I want
to do when I go home

12:07.009 --> 12:08.454
Is read murder books.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.947
Aren't you curious?

12:12.330 --> 12:13.529
Curious?

12:13.595 --> 12:17.456
About how people can do these
kinds of things to one another.

12:20.618 --> 12:22.762
Whoever did this read Castle's books,

12:22.762 --> 12:26.002
And somewhere in those pages Is the
answer to where he'll strike next.

12:26.384 --> 12:27.217
Okay.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.781
Is all that Castle's mail?

12:37.219 --> 12:41.035
His fans love him almost
as much as he loves himself.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.530
Can you take that back
to briefing, please?

12:45.311 --> 12:46.574
Did we hear back from the lab?

12:46.574 --> 12:48.726
Yeah, scene was negative
for D.N.A and prints,

12:48.726 --> 12:50.466
Just like Fisk. The guy's careful.

12:50.672 --> 12:52.991
What about Tisdale and
Fisk, any connection?

12:53.235 --> 12:55.678
Other than your boy there? No.

12:56.827 --> 12:57.953
What's he doing here?

12:57.953 --> 12:59.122
Maybe he likes you.

12:59.122 --> 13:00.155
Detective Beckett.

13:00.791 --> 13:01.863
Captain?

13:03.190 --> 13:04.021
Yes, sir?

13:04.021 --> 13:06.633
Mr. Castle's offered to
assist with the investigation.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.146
Really?

13:08.146 --> 13:10.438
It's the least I can
do for the city I love.

13:10.438 --> 13:12.027
Considering the nature
of the crime scenes,

13:12.027 --> 13:13.186
I think it's a good idea.

13:14.384 --> 13:18.404
Sir, can I talk to you
for a minute, in private?

13:18.588 --> 13:19.566
Nope.

13:41.499 --> 13:42.643
What?

13:42.643 --> 13:43.578
Nothing.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.127
No, it's just, uh,

13:45.403 --> 13:47.875
The way your brow furrows
when you're thinking--

13:48.331 --> 13:49.494
It's cute.

13:49.494 --> 13:50.882
I mean, not if you were playing poker.

13:50.882 --> 13:52.442
Then it'd be deadly. But otherwise...

13:52.442 --> 13:53.682
can I ask you a question?

13:53.682 --> 13:54.635
Shoot.

13:54.635 --> 13:55.975
Why are you here?

13:56.315 --> 13:59.421
You don't care about the victims,
so you aren't here for justice.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.928
You don't care that the
guy's aping your books,

14:01.928 --> 14:03.134
So you aren't here
'cause you're outraged.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.866
So what is it, Rick?

14:05.018 --> 14:06.463
Are you here to annoy?

14:06.463 --> 14:08.170
I'm here for the story.

14:08.170 --> 14:09.094
The story?

14:09.094 --> 14:12.250
Why those people?
Why those murders?

14:12.464 --> 14:14.799
Sometimes there is no story.

14:14.799 --> 14:17.214
Sometimes the guy is just a psychopath.

14:17.214 --> 14:18.386
There's always a story,

14:18.386 --> 14:21.341
Always a chain of events that
makes everything make sense.

14:21.341 --> 14:22.635
Take you, for example.

14:22.635 --> 14:25.880
Under normal circumstances,
you should not be here.

14:25.880 --> 14:29.422
Most smart, good-looking
women become lawyers, not cops.

14:29.422 --> 14:32.895
And yet, here you are. Why?

14:33.250 --> 14:34.835
I don't know, Rick.

14:35.122 --> 14:37.514
You're the novelist. You tell me.

14:39.768 --> 14:41.047
Well, you're not bridge and tunnel.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.203
No trace of the boroughs when you talk,

14:42.203 --> 14:43.987
So that means Manhattan,
that means money.

14:44.654 --> 14:46.807
You went to college,
probably a pretty good one.

14:46.807 --> 14:47.974
You had options.

14:48.122 --> 14:50.011
Yeah, you had
lots of options--

14:50.011 --> 14:53.446
Better options, more
socially acceptable options--

14:53.446 --> 14:54.701
And you still chose this.

14:55.331 --> 14:58.434
That tells me something happened.

15:00.018 --> 15:01.370
Not to you.

15:01.807 --> 15:04.085
No, you're wounded, but
you're not that wounded.

15:05.483 --> 15:07.430
No, it was somebody you cared about.

15:09.213 --> 15:10.988
It was someone you loved.

15:14.370 --> 15:15.751
And you probably
could've lived with that,

15:15.751 --> 15:18.003
But the person responsible
was never caught.

15:24.638 --> 15:26.712
And that, Detective
Beckett, is why you're here.

15:35.387 --> 15:36.887
Cute trick.

15:38.082 --> 15:39.690
But don't think you know me.

15:42.359 --> 15:43.827
The point is, there's always a story.

15:43.827 --> 15:45.227
You--You just
have to find it.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.010
I think I just did.

16:03.702 --> 16:05.814
Lab's got lifts off the letter.

16:05.814 --> 16:06.434
Whose?

16:06.434 --> 16:08.918
The system's backlogged.
It'll take a week to run a match.

16:08.918 --> 16:09.974
A week?

16:09.974 --> 16:11.755
Welcome to reality, superstar.

16:11.755 --> 16:13.812
Well, never did much like reality.

16:13.812 --> 16:14.886
Mayor's office.

16:14.886 --> 16:17.043
Hi, Denise. It's Rick Castle.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.918
- Hi.
- Yeah, is he in?

16:18.918 --> 16:20.138
- Hold on.
- Thanks.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.606
Like I said, the mayor's a fan.

16:22.843 --> 16:23.582
Rick!

16:23.582 --> 16:24.947
Yo, big cheese. It's Ricky.

16:24.947 --> 16:26.602
- You doing okay?
- Yeah, of course.

16:26.602 --> 16:28.043
- What's up?
- Well, I don't know where you went.

16:28.043 --> 16:30.498
We looked all over for you.
You took off with that girl.

16:30.498 --> 16:32.618
The man's got the mayor on speed dial.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.010
The rich really are different.

16:34.010 --> 16:35.114
You want himhe's yours.

16:35.114 --> 16:37.271
A control freak like you with
something you can't control?

16:37.271 --> 16:38.985
No, no. That's gonna be
more fun than shark week.

16:38.985 --> 16:42.516
Okay, you will have
your prints in an hour.

16:42.516 --> 16:43.451
Mr. Castle?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.882
Half of the guys here
are waiting for prints.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.199
You don't just jump the line.

16:50.199 --> 16:52.846
Oh, I think somebody feels threatened.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.518
- I am not threatened.
- No, no, I get it.

16:54.518 --> 16:55.719
I can call the mayor, and you can't.

16:55.719 --> 16:57.403
We have procedure, protocol.

16:57.403 --> 16:59.954
Yeah, and you always come to
a complete stop at a red light

16:59.954 --> 17:01.934
And you never fudge your taxes.

17:01.934 --> 17:04.410
Tell me something. Do
you ever have any fun?

17:04.410 --> 17:06.872
You know, let your hair
down? Drop your top?

17:06.872 --> 17:08.167
A little "cops gone wild"?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.420
You do know I'm wearing a gun?

17:11.089 --> 17:14.488
Beckett, midtown. They
just found another one.

17:26.021 --> 17:27.853
"Death of a prom queen."

17:28.126 --> 17:30.103
Maintenance found her an hour ago.

17:30.898 --> 17:33.242
Kendra Pitney. She
lives in the building.

17:33.988 --> 17:36.075
All right. Let's get
her out of the water.

17:36.866 --> 17:39.898
Um, you just stay here
and don't touch anything.

17:52.483 --> 17:54.683
Hi, I'm richard Castle. I'm consulting.

17:54.683 --> 17:56.360
Richard Castle the author?

17:56.360 --> 17:57.454
On my better days.

17:57.454 --> 18:00.991
Lanie Parish, medical examiner.
I love your books.

18:00.991 --> 18:03.519
You know, you have a real
gift with the details of death.

18:03.519 --> 18:04.962
I thought I told you to stay over there.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.433
I got lonely.

18:06.931 --> 18:07.983
You got a C.O.D.?

18:07.983 --> 18:10.906
Not until the full exam.
But this wasn't a stabbing.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.431
Lack of blood around the wound

18:12.431 --> 18:14.343
Suggests she was dead
before it was inserted.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.874
No foam around the mouth,
so we know she didn't drown.

18:16.874 --> 18:18.295
Oh, you're good.

18:18.295 --> 18:20.339
Yeah, yeah. She was killed
first and then posed,

18:20.339 --> 18:21.362
Just like the others.

18:21.679 --> 18:24.709
Yeah. I know.
Can I have a word?

18:27.574 --> 18:28.434
Something wrong?

18:28.434 --> 18:30.915
This is a homicide investigation,
Not a day at Disneyland.

18:30.915 --> 18:33.167
If I give you an order,
i expect you to obey it.

18:33.167 --> 18:34.650
Then you don't know me very well.

18:34.650 --> 18:36.697
You know, in my book,
the dress was blue.

18:36.847 --> 18:38.178
Stop trying to change the subject.

18:38.178 --> 18:39.635
Did Tisdale and Fisk know each other?

18:39.635 --> 18:41.662
We haven't found a connection. Why?

18:41.662 --> 18:42.627
What about motive?

18:42.971 --> 18:45.586
He's a serial killer.
He doesn't need motive.

18:45.887 --> 18:48.149
Beckett. Okay.

18:48.578 --> 18:50.270
They got a match off the print.

18:50.347 --> 18:52.778
Kyle Cabot-- He's in Brooklyn.
We got him.

19:00.964 --> 19:03.360
- Stay here.
- Scout'shonor.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.213
Kyle Cabot! NYPD! Open up!

19:28.234 --> 19:30.732
Kyle Cabot! NYPD!

19:30.767 --> 19:31.950
Room clear. Room clear.

19:32.536 --> 19:33.861
All clear.

19:56.018 --> 19:58.145
You should invite him
to join your book club.

20:03.923 --> 20:06.691
Beckett! You gotta see this.

20:17.003 --> 20:19.066
Oh, that's creepy.

20:20.254 --> 20:22.443
I was never a scout.

20:23.443 --> 20:24.529
Hey, Beckett.

20:26.982 --> 20:28.558
Alison's blouse.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.676
I'm guessing he kept trophies.

20:32.635 --> 20:33.912
.22 caliber.

20:45.634 --> 20:46.687
Show me your hands!

20:46.687 --> 20:49.315
Hands in the air! Let us see your
hands, Cabot! Let me see your hands!

20:56.984 --> 20:58.665
He's still not speaking.

20:58.703 --> 21:02.163
State medical records indicate he's
got pervasive developmental disorder.

21:02.163 --> 21:04.249
Well, that explains
his fixation with me.

21:04.306 --> 21:07.282
P.D.D. sometimes manifests in an
obsession with a single subject.

21:07.282 --> 21:10.578
Yeah, well, your superfan also
has a history of delusions.

21:10.578 --> 21:12.014
Guess who his caseworker was.

21:12.014 --> 21:13.212
Alison Tisdale.

21:13.681 --> 21:14.732
Yeah.

21:15.035 --> 21:18.019
Her files indicate that he was
on pretty heavy antipsychotics.

21:18.019 --> 21:21.061
Limited intelligence, thinks he has a
personal relationship with his hero--

21:21.061 --> 21:23.062
Looks like your profile was
right, Detective Beckett.

21:23.062 --> 21:25.275
So... what, that--
That's it?

21:25.275 --> 21:27.377
What more do you want?
Evidence is in his apartment,

21:27.377 --> 21:29.039
We can connect him
with the three victims--

21:29.039 --> 21:30.603
Two from the diner where he worked,

21:30.603 --> 21:32.075
And Tisdale was his social worker.

21:32.075 --> 21:33.965
Call the D.A.
Get him a legal aid.

21:33.965 --> 21:36.415
- Okay. - I'm--That's,
uh, it's too easy.

21:36.415 --> 21:37.946
The reader would never buy it.

21:37.946 --> 21:39.370
This isn't one of your books, Castle.

21:39.370 --> 21:41.486
Out here, we find a gustanding
over a body with a gun,

21:41.486 --> 21:42.878
He's usually the guy who did it.

21:54.639 --> 21:57.581
You know this kid was in and
out of the system for years?

21:58.099 --> 21:59.722
Doesn't seem like he ever
got the proper treatment

21:59.722 --> 22:02.195
Until Alison Tisdale
took over his case file.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.347
She's the one who got
him a job at the diner,

22:04.347 --> 22:06.986
And her notes seem to
say heas doing okay.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.091
Well, you can let the D.A.
worry about all that now.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.454
Our job is done.

22:11.454 --> 22:12.430
Yeah.

22:12.611 --> 22:15.635
Hey, um, can you leave the box?
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

22:21.811 --> 22:24.690
Castle, I'm kinda glad
that you killed off Storm.

22:24.690 --> 22:26.082
Less competition.

22:26.082 --> 22:27.099
Mm.

22:27.202 --> 22:28.698
That's $20 to you, Cannell.

22:28.698 --> 22:30.506
You're bluffin', Patterson.

22:30.506 --> 22:33.174
Cough up some of that TV
money and you'll find out.

22:36.331 --> 22:37.994
Ah, bet's to you, Ricky.

22:40.830 --> 22:41.886
Castle?

22:42.237 --> 22:43.399
- Castle!
- Hmm?

22:43.399 --> 22:45.275
- Bet's to you.
- Oh. Sorry.

22:45.275 --> 22:47.876
I know that look--
Story trouble.

22:47.876 --> 22:49.707
Yeah, you never should've
killed off Storm.

22:49.707 --> 22:52.018
That was a big mistake.
I w-- I would've retired him.

22:52.635 --> 22:55.131
Or crippled him. I
mean, the man was money.

22:55.131 --> 22:57.587
You don't see me Puttin' a
bullet through alex cross' head.

22:57.587 --> 23:00.731
Yeah, my boy shane scully's
gonna be fueling my private jet

23:00.731 --> 23:03.270
Long after people have
all forgotten about Storm.

23:03.270 --> 23:05.782
Oh, you know what? Just
for that, I am gonna call.

23:07.307 --> 23:08.767
So what's the problem, Ricky?

23:08.767 --> 23:09.971
Maybe we can help.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.291
I'm working on this thing. It
starts with a famous author.

23:13.291 --> 23:16.831
Some psycho starts staging murders
Like the way he does in his books.

23:17.385 --> 23:19.863
That's pretty
self-aggrandizing, isn't it?

23:19.863 --> 23:21.754
This is Castle we're talking about.

23:21.754 --> 23:23.851
So... The crime scenes are clean.

23:24.227 --> 23:26.971
Doesn't leave any fingerprints.
Doesn't leave any D.N.A.

23:26.971 --> 23:29.939
But the psycho writes the author a
fan letter with his prints all over it.

23:29.939 --> 23:31.433
Well, that leads the
cops to his apartment,

23:31.433 --> 23:33.393
Where they find enough
evidence to convict him.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.100
And then?

23:39.100 --> 23:40.907
- That's it.
- That's it?

23:40.907 --> 23:42.219
Yeah. They arrest him.

23:42.334 --> 23:44.917
That's terrible. No
wonder you're blocked.

23:44.917 --> 23:46.103
And here's
another thing--

23:46.103 --> 23:48.498
The guy doesn't leave his
prints at the scene of the crime,

23:48.498 --> 23:50.335
But he sends a letter
with his prints on it?

23:50.335 --> 23:52.058
Ahya lost me there.

23:52.058 --> 23:53.946
- And what about a twist?
- Yeah. Where's the twist?

23:53.946 --> 23:56.870
Yeah, right. Like, uh... like,
maybe somebody set this kid up.

23:56.870 --> 23:58.058
That's what your
story needs--

23:58.058 --> 24:00.000
The character who thinks
the kid's innocent,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.112
Keeps digging until he finds the truth.

24:03.634 --> 24:05.578
Oh, I have just the guy.

24:13.379 --> 24:14.412
What are you doing?

24:14.413 --> 24:15.868
It's a novelist's habit--

24:15.868 --> 24:17.265
Poking through other people's mail,

24:17.265 --> 24:18.774
Checking their medicine cabinets.

24:18.895 --> 24:20.277
Why are you still here?

24:20.754 --> 24:22.859
I just came by to give you this.

24:22.859 --> 24:24.123
It's a little something to...

24:24.446 --> 24:27.247
Memorialize our brief partnership.

24:28.410 --> 24:29.771
Don't look so suspicious.

24:29.771 --> 24:31.690
Go on. Open it.

24:37.553 --> 24:39.713
I got you an advance copy.

24:39.931 --> 24:41.986
I even signed it to you.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.164
Not that you're a fan.

24:46.278 --> 24:48.590
Thanks. That's actually kind of...

24:49.762 --> 24:50.978
Sweet.

24:57.145 --> 24:58.475
- Well...
- Well...

24:58.998 --> 25:01.518
It was nice to have met
you, detective Beckett.

25:32.538 --> 25:34.074
He didn't.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.215
Oh! He did!

25:40.641 --> 25:47.238
Richard Castle, you are under arrest for
felony theft and obstruction of justice.

25:47.238 --> 25:48.810
You forgot making you look bad.

25:49.182 --> 25:50.506
You know, for a minute there,

25:50.506 --> 25:53.296
You actually made me
believe that you were human.

25:53.522 --> 25:54.522
Cuff him.

25:54.662 --> 25:58.119
Ooh! Bondage. My safe word is "apples."

25:58.119 --> 25:59.720
Oh, there's no nd to be gentle.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.019
How'd you find me anyway?

26:01.019 --> 26:03.114
I'm a detective. That's what I do.

26:03.114 --> 26:04.923
My mother told you, didn't she?

26:05.666 --> 26:08.286
By the way, the rose petals
in the Tisdale murder?

26:08.286 --> 26:10.395
They're grandiflora, not hybrid teas.

26:10.395 --> 26:11.527
I'll make a note of it.

26:11.527 --> 26:14.383
Yeah, you probably should since
it means Kyle Cabot is innocent.

26:18.993 --> 26:20.299
Thank you, officer.

26:22.966 --> 26:24.954
- Hello, father.
- Hello, daughter.

26:24.954 --> 26:26.815
I wish I could say I was surprised.

26:26.815 --> 26:29.971
It's my fault, really. He
never had a father figure.

26:29.971 --> 26:32.874
Oh, that's not true, mother.
I had lots of father figures.

26:32.874 --> 26:35.275
I see you've met Captain
Montgomery and Detective Beckett.

26:38.349 --> 26:40.571
No more interference with
this case, Mr. Castle.

26:40.954 --> 26:42.310
Do we understand each other?

26:42.310 --> 26:43.167
Yeah.

26:44.419 --> 26:46.291
But you still got the wrong guy.

26:46.935 --> 26:48.627
I... really.

26:49.045 --> 26:53.290
Darling, must you always
have to make a comment?

26:58.279 --> 27:01.515
Nah. No, no, no. Don't
tell me that he got to you.

27:01.775 --> 27:03.751
Please. He didn't get to me.

27:03.859 --> 27:04.946
She did.

27:05.139 --> 27:06.211
Who-- Alison?

27:06.823 --> 27:10.090
Marvin Fisk, first murder.
Kyle knew him from the diner.

27:10.090 --> 27:13.319
And then he kills
Alison, his social worker.

27:13.319 --> 27:15.894
And then he kills Kendra
Pitney, also from the diner.

27:17.242 --> 27:18.162
So?

27:18.162 --> 27:20.855
So he starts with a
murder of convenience

27:21.233 --> 27:24.365
And then escalates to a murder
of somebody he knows very well

27:24.365 --> 27:27.099
And then goes back to
a murder of convenience?

27:27.099 --> 27:28.427
It doesn't make any sense.

27:28.427 --> 27:30.498
Somebody set up Kyle to take the fall.

27:30.498 --> 27:33.726
Somebody who knew enough
about his fixation with me

27:33.726 --> 27:35.231
To use it to get away with murder.

27:35.231 --> 27:37.511
That means we're not
looking for a serial killer.

27:37.511 --> 27:41.138
We're looking for a good, old-fashioned
murderer-- Someone with motive.

27:41.378 --> 27:43.347
You think the victims
were somehow related?

27:43.598 --> 27:45.367
Police would've found it by now.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.273
Now if I were writing the story,

27:47.587 --> 27:49.825
The killer would've only
wanted one of the victims dead.

27:49.825 --> 27:52.517
He would've killed the other
ones just to cover up the crime.

27:52.517 --> 27:54.806
How do you get away with one
murder by committing two more?

27:54.806 --> 27:56.626
At one death, you look for motive.

27:56.626 --> 27:58.406
At two, you look for a connection.

27:58.406 --> 28:00.503
At three, you look
for someone like Kyle.

28:00.503 --> 28:01.645
At three, you don't need motive,

28:01.645 --> 28:05.694
Because mentally unstable serial
killers don't usually have one.

28:05.694 --> 28:08.270
That makes about as much
sense as "mousetrap."

28:08.639 --> 28:11.123
I did that play eight
times a week for a year.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.578
I still have no idea what it's about.

28:16.774 --> 28:17.730
Castle was right.

28:18.713 --> 28:20.575
If he was trying to follow his boo,

28:20.575 --> 28:22.650
Then the roses on
Alison's body were wrong,

28:22.650 --> 28:25.327
And Fisk should've been
suffocated by a plastic bag,

28:25.327 --> 28:27.055
Not strangled with a necktie.

28:27.055 --> 28:29.389
And Kendra's dress should've
been blue, not yellow.

28:29.389 --> 28:31.742
For an obsessive, It would've been
impossible not to get the details right.

28:31.742 --> 28:33.315
Well, if it wasn't him, then who was it?

28:33.315 --> 28:37.840
The killer had to have known both his
intended victim and Kyle fairly well.

28:38.173 --> 28:40.899
The only victim that
had any real knowledge

28:40.899 --> 28:45.819
Of Kyle's obsessive condition
would've been Alison Tisdale.

28:45.819 --> 28:48.747
Alison's the key. She's the one
that the killer is trying to hide.

28:48.747 --> 28:50.454
Well, as far as we know,
she wasn't seeing anyone.

28:50.454 --> 28:52.818
And none of her other case
profiles fit the profile.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.088
Well, somebody had to
know something about her.

28:55.088 --> 28:57.367
So if the killer found out
about Kyle through Alison,

28:57.367 --> 28:59.255
Then Alison must've
been the intended target.

29:00.099 --> 29:04.002
Somebody wanted Alison dead.
We just have to figure out why.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.034
If I have to keep bailing you out,

29:06.034 --> 29:07.975
You're gonna need to
raise my allowance...

29:08.770 --> 29:09.999
By a lot.

29:10.131 --> 29:11.281
Mine, too.

29:19.847 --> 29:22.548
Hi, I'm Rick Castle.

29:22.548 --> 29:24.255
I have an appointment
to see Mr. Tisdale.

29:27.303 --> 29:28.748
Is he now?

29:30.123 --> 29:32.477
This is not what it
looks like. This, uh...

29:32.738 --> 29:34.528
Okay, this is exactly
what it looks like,

29:34.528 --> 29:35.615
But I can explain.

29:36.002 --> 29:37.082
You coming?

29:41.250 --> 29:44.652
Did Alison ever mention Having
enemies or being threatened?

29:46.066 --> 29:47.258
People loved her.

29:47.258 --> 29:49.167
All she wanted was to make
the world a better place.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.794
I told all this to the other detective.

29:50.794 --> 29:52.259
I know, sir. We're just following up.

29:52.259 --> 29:54.747
Did Alison know anybody who
could've profited from her death?

29:55.619 --> 29:59.355
Mr. Castle, I may be rich,
but my daughter was not.

29:59.391 --> 30:00.831
She abhorred money.

30:01.339 --> 30:03.686
What little she had,
she gave to charity.

30:03.686 --> 30:04.679
Thank you, sir.

30:06.106 --> 30:11.998
Mr. Tisdale, "Fortune" magazine estimated
your net worth at nearly $100 million.

30:11.998 --> 30:12.931
Is that true?

30:13.787 --> 30:15.334
I don't check day to day.

30:15.334 --> 30:16.496
But it's in the ballpark?

30:18.027 --> 30:19.759
I've been lucky, yes.

30:19.915 --> 30:21.001
Appreciate your time.

30:23.807 --> 30:26.967
Wh-What happens to all that
money if something happens to you?

30:26.967 --> 30:27.778
Castle.

30:27.778 --> 30:30.282
Half of my estate goes to
my charitable foundation,

30:30.282 --> 30:31.463
And the rest to my children.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.811
I mean, my son.

30:37.654 --> 30:38.727
Thank you.

30:49.371 --> 30:51.058
What was that all about?

30:51.058 --> 30:52.070
He's dying.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.412
Who's dying? Tisdale?

30:55.690 --> 30:57.619
You want a hot dog? I want a hot dog.

30:57.876 --> 31:00.514
What do you take on your--
Aah! Apples, apples, apples!

31:00.514 --> 31:03.165
- What makes you think he's dying?
- Okay!

31:04.275 --> 31:05.927
- You see those pictures in his office?
- Yeah.

31:05.927 --> 31:08.602
He's much thinner now--Like
sick thin, not workout thin.

31:08.602 --> 31:10.023
His daughter was just murdered.

31:10.023 --> 31:12.353
And the way he kept touching his
hair, like he's self-conscious.

31:12.353 --> 31:13.150
You think it was a piece?

31:13.150 --> 31:14.961
It's a good one, but it's new to him.

31:14.961 --> 31:16.470
The chemo's relatively recent.

31:16.470 --> 31:17.953
And he was wearing makeup.

31:17.953 --> 31:19.290
He's trying to look
healthier than he is.

31:19.290 --> 31:20.663
Doesn't want his shareholders to know.

31:20.827 --> 31:23.239
So he's got cancer. That
doesn't mean that he's terminal.

31:23.239 --> 31:25.679
But it's a much better story if he is.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.599
You interview the brother?

31:27.883 --> 31:29.354
There was never a reason to.

31:29.354 --> 31:30.752
Well, now there is.

31:31.905 --> 31:33.482
- You got hot mustard?
- Yeah.

31:38.490 --> 31:40.112
- Harrison Tisdale.
- Yeah.

31:40.112 --> 31:42.487
Hey, Mitch, let's get
these pallets on the truck.

31:42.487 --> 31:44.421
Detective Kate Beckett.
Rick Castle.

31:44.421 --> 31:46.685
We'd like to ask you some
questions about your sister.

31:46.685 --> 31:48.964
Yeah, anything I can do.
Uh, let's head inside.

31:49.202 --> 31:52.280
Last time I saw her?
About a month ago at dad's.

31:53.447 --> 31:56.598
You know, I... still
can't believe she's gone.

31:56.669 --> 31:58.106
Were you close?

31:58.106 --> 32:00.886
Ah, everybody loved
her. I mean, my sister--

32:00.886 --> 32:02.958
She just wanted to
see the best in people,

32:03.350 --> 32:05.807
Even that kid who killed her.

32:06.146 --> 32:08.834
You know, she did everything
she could to help that guy.

32:09.591 --> 32:12.378
Even brought him around here once
To see if I could get him a job.

32:12.378 --> 32:13.643
But you didn't.

32:13.651 --> 32:15.403
I can't afford to, all right?

32:15.403 --> 32:17.657
My employees mess up, I lose my bond.

32:18.391 --> 32:21.695
I don't know. Maybe if I'd helped him...

32:22.094 --> 32:23.683
Things would be different.

32:23.683 --> 32:26.533
How'd your sister react when
yourad told you he was dying?

32:28.506 --> 32:30.088
She was upset.

32:30.088 --> 32:31.239
We both were.

32:31.754 --> 32:35.565
Now that she's dead, your
inheritance stands to double.

32:35.895 --> 32:38.412
What are you suggesting? You
already caught the killer.

32:38.412 --> 32:42.855
Yeah, we did, but the first thing his lawyers
will do Is shift suspicion to someone else,

32:42.855 --> 32:44.110
someone with motive.

32:44.110 --> 32:46.778
And then they'll stick me on the stand
and ask me why I didn't investigate,

32:46.778 --> 32:48.114
And then the jury will have doubts.

32:48.114 --> 32:50.166
And we don't want them
to have doubts, do we?

32:50.166 --> 32:51.029
No.

32:51.029 --> 32:52.558
So you'll have to excuse me for asking,

32:52.558 --> 32:54.426
But where were you the night
of your sister's murder?

32:54.426 --> 32:57.522
I was traveling... on business.

32:58.094 --> 33:01.915
Actually, I was out of the
country For all three murders.

33:02.851 --> 33:06.090
Here. Check the stamps
on that if it's useful.

33:10.903 --> 33:12.374
A U.S. passport.

33:12.374 --> 33:13.922
Absolutely unassailable.

33:13.922 --> 33:15.459
I was sure it was him.

33:15.762 --> 33:17.284
Oh, don't take it so hard.

33:17.659 --> 33:20.394
After all, you're just a writer.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.127
What?

33:22.127 --> 33:22.886
Nothing.

33:23.139 --> 33:24.198
What?

33:24.521 --> 33:25.843
Oh, come on.

33:26.111 --> 33:27.658
He's lying.

33:27.658 --> 33:30.774
I mean, I get him knowing where he
was the night of his sister's murder,

33:30.774 --> 33:31.898
But the other two victims?

33:31.898 --> 33:34.776
He didn't pause, he
didn't ask for dates,

33:34.776 --> 33:36.930
He didn't even check his calendar,

33:36.930 --> 33:38.642
But he was ready with an alibi.

33:38.642 --> 33:42.241
In my experience, innocent
people do not prepare alibis.

33:43.114 --> 33:44.514
So I was right.

33:46.313 --> 33:48.361
Okay, give me the dates and flights.

33:48.534 --> 33:50.498
Why can't you just admit I was right?

33:50.498 --> 33:53.475
Because he totally fooled you.
He totally bought the alibi.

33:53.901 --> 33:56.281
I had a fleeting moment of self-doubt.

33:56.497 --> 33:57.319
So?

33:57.319 --> 33:59.994
His credit card company confirms he
paid for three round-trip tickets.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.554
Dates coincide with the three murders.

34:01.554 --> 34:04.090
So according to his credit card,
Tisdale was out of the country.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.310
Wait a minute. So now I'm not right?

34:05.310 --> 34:07.222
Which means the passport
stamps were forged.

34:07.222 --> 34:09.577
I'm gonna call passport control
and have 'em check their logs.

34:09.637 --> 34:11.630
That's, uh, not how he would've done it.

34:14.098 --> 34:15.775
You got a better idea, Ricky?

34:15.775 --> 34:16.996
Second passport.

34:16.996 --> 34:18.106
And how would he get one of those?

34:18.106 --> 34:19.670
Oh, with his money? Trust me.

34:19.670 --> 34:21.342
On the black market, it
would be a piece of cake.

34:21.342 --> 34:23.031
So he leaves the country on his own,

34:23.178 --> 34:25.938
Comes back with the other
passport, commits murder,

34:25.938 --> 34:28.619
Flies out and then
comes back in on his own.

34:28.619 --> 34:30.626
Perfect alibi, perfect murder.

34:30.793 --> 34:32.690
But almost impossible to prove.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.074
Unless you find the second passport.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.982
Gotta be freaked after
your little meet and greet.

34:35.982 --> 34:38.793
Keep eyeballs on him. If
he moves, I wanna know.

34:39.943 --> 34:42.181
The things that people
will do for money.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.569
This guy killed his
own sister in cold blood

34:44.569 --> 34:46.121
And two more people to cover it up.

34:46.121 --> 34:47.911
He's either a world-class sociopath,

34:48.047 --> 34:50.038
Or there's a lot more to
this story than just money.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.655
Judge markway, please.

34:51.655 --> 34:53.418
Oh, markway. Tell him I said hello.

34:57.539 --> 35:01.083
No, seriously. They're
redoing the entire back nine.

35:01.083 --> 35:03.076
Oh, man, I loved that course.
When are they gonna reopen it?

35:03.076 --> 35:05.434
Judge, I hate to break up "golf digest,"

35:05.434 --> 35:07.206
But I have an exigent situation here.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.874
Very well, detective. Play through.

35:08.874 --> 35:09.966
We need a search warrant.

35:10.619 --> 35:12.159
She needs a search warrant.

35:12.159 --> 35:14.236
For the home and office
of Harrison Tisdale.

35:14.236 --> 35:17.538
Harrison Tisdale? As in
Jonathan Tisdale's son?

35:17.538 --> 35:18.910
-  Yes.
- Yep. He murdered his sister

35:18.910 --> 35:20.585
And killed two more people
to cover up the crime.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.038
Murder? The Tisdales?

35:22.038 --> 35:24.266
You better be long and
straight on this one, detective.

35:24.266 --> 35:26.747
Harrison's father is
terminally ill, sir.

35:26.747 --> 35:28.859
What? I just saw him at a benefit.

35:28.859 --> 35:29.872
Hope you took a picture.

35:30.097 --> 35:33.091
With the sister out of the way,
the son will inherit all of it.

35:33.446 --> 35:34.234
Excuse me.

35:34.234 --> 35:37.096
There's also a twisted,
emotional angle in there.

35:37.096 --> 35:39.303
I don't wa to bore you with the
details. But family and vengeance--

35:39.303 --> 35:40.289
It's Shakespearean.

35:40.289 --> 35:41.426
Harrison just left work.

35:41.426 --> 35:44.174
He's probably headed home
to destroy the evidence.

35:44.731 --> 35:47.630
Are you sure you can tie
him to the other victims?

35:47.630 --> 35:49.846
Through a patient of his sister's
That he was trying to frame.

35:50.612 --> 35:54.914
It's days like this I wish
I was back in civil division.

35:55.662 --> 35:56.839
Thank you, sir.

35:57.743 --> 35:59.303
Thanks. Soon.

36:01.814 --> 36:03.766
You're home early, Mr. Tisdale.

36:20.835 --> 36:21.766
Got a list inside.

36:21.766 --> 36:23.101
Yeah, thanks for your help.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.411
What do we got, guys?

36:30.411 --> 36:32.646
Get this. Junior's
business is going under.

36:32.646 --> 36:34.138
He's tens of millions in debt.

36:34.138 --> 36:36.026
But with his sister's share
of the Tisdale fortune,

36:36.026 --> 36:37.818
He stands to pay off
his debt and then some.

36:37.818 --> 36:40.581
Castle, if you're going
in, you should be armed.

36:40.581 --> 36:42.351
My backup's in the glove compartment.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.323
I can't find it. It--

36:49.691 --> 36:51.466
This time, you're staying put.

36:51.610 --> 36:54.223
Oh, okay, Beckett. Very funny.

36:54.427 --> 36:55.895
Joke's over!

36:56.279 --> 36:57.799
Come on!

37:04.719 --> 37:07.442
Cuff me once, shame on you.

37:07.499 --> 37:10.626
Cuff me twice, shame on me.

37:19.969 --> 37:23.090
Harrison Tisdale?
NYPD. We have a warrant.

37:23.090 --> 37:24.058
Just a minute!

37:36.722 --> 37:38.728
Open the door, Harrison!

37:40.006 --> 37:43.465
Open the door. It's
NYPD. We have a warrant.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.190
He's coming down the fire escape.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.734
He's out back. Cover the front.

38:19.314 --> 38:21.176
Stop! Police! Don't move!

38:23.235 --> 38:25.680
Castle! No!

38:26.637 --> 38:29.236
I got him! I got him!

38:29.570 --> 38:30.980
Castle!

38:47.499 --> 38:49.187
Stay back! Stay back!
Don't come anywhere closer!

38:49.187 --> 38:50.519
Get--Get down!
Stay back! Stay back!

38:50.520 --> 38:51.851
- Don't move!
- Easy, easy!

38:51.851 --> 38:52.986
Let him go, Harrison!

38:52.986 --> 38:55.820
- Come on!
- Easy! Easy! Okay. It's okay. Okay.

38:55.820 --> 38:56.890
Castle! Are you okay?

38:56.890 --> 38:59.474
Yeah, except psycho
here needs a breath mint.

38:59.474 --> 39:00.790
- Shut up!
- Okay!

39:00.790 --> 39:03.134
Hey, Harrison, you
know what's bugging me?

39:03.281 --> 39:04.898
If you were that deep in debt,

39:05.206 --> 39:07.143
Why didn't you just ask
your father for the money?

39:07.143 --> 39:08.944
Castle! You are not helping!

39:09.627 --> 39:12.507
You know what I think?
I think you did ask.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.951
I think you asked, and he said no.

39:15.286 --> 39:17.103
I think he always said no.

39:17.446 --> 39:19.953
Self-made man like that, I bet he
thought you were weak for asking.

39:19.953 --> 39:21.529
He's the one who was weak!

39:21.529 --> 39:23.206
I was trying to make
something with my life,

39:23.206 --> 39:24.859
And all he cared about was her!

39:25.994 --> 39:28.886
That's why you killed her.
It wasn't just for the money.

39:28.954 --> 39:30.993
You wanted to punish him before he died,

39:30.993 --> 39:32.493
Take away the only thing he loved.

39:32.594 --> 39:34.355
That's a pretty good story.

39:35.074 --> 39:36.235
Who are you?

39:36.235 --> 39:38.111
Harrison, let him go! It's over.

39:38.111 --> 39:39.769
It's not over, it's not over!

39:39.769 --> 39:41.667
Drop the gun, or I
swear to God, I'll--

39:43.952 --> 39:45.360
Tell me you saw that!

39:48.126 --> 39:50.011
You're gonna put that
in your report, right?

39:50.554 --> 39:51.843
Can I see the cuffs, please?

39:51.843 --> 39:53.049
Yeah, yeah.

39:56.126 --> 39:57.260
What the hell were you thinking?

39:57.260 --> 39:58.546
You could've gotten yourself killed.

39:58.546 --> 40:00.274
Well, the safety was on the whole time.

40:01.922 --> 40:03.715
You know, you could've told me.

40:03.715 --> 40:04.908
Where's the fun in that?

40:15.262 --> 40:17.855
Well, I guess this is it.

40:18.113 --> 40:19.159
Well, it doesn't have to be.

40:19.159 --> 40:22.255
We could, uh, go to
dinner, debrief each other.

40:22.255 --> 40:24.915
Why, Castle? So it could be
another one of your conquests?

40:24.915 --> 40:26.472
Or I could be one of yours.

40:28.471 --> 40:30.582
It was nice to meet you, Castle.

40:33.090 --> 40:34.309
It's too bad.

40:34.707 --> 40:36.320
It would've been great.

40:40.311 --> 40:42.142
You have no idea.

41:19.131 --> 41:20.635
You wanted to see me, sir?

41:20.635 --> 41:21.796
Yeah.

41:22.074 --> 41:24.313
I just got a call from
the mayor's office.

41:24.840 --> 41:26.992
Apparently, you have a fan.

41:26.992 --> 41:27.996
A fan, sir?

41:27.996 --> 41:32.087
Rick Castle. Seems he's found the main
character For his next set of novels--

41:32.087 --> 41:34.422
A tough but savvy female detective.

41:36.858 --> 41:37.957
I'm flattered?

41:37.957 --> 41:40.539
Don't be. He says he has to do research.

41:40.539 --> 41:41.727
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

41:41.727 --> 41:42.751
- No way.
- Beckett, listen--

41:42.751 --> 41:44.593
Sir, he is like a 9 year
old on a sugar rush--

41:44.593 --> 41:47.159
Totally incapable of
taking anything seriously.

41:47.159 --> 41:48.758
But he did help solve this case.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.983
And when the mayor's happy,
the commissioner's happy.

41:50.983 --> 41:53.452
And when the commissioner's
happy, I'm happy.

41:53.452 --> 41:54.604
How long, sir?

41:57.704 --> 42:01.372
