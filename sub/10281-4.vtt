WEBVTT

00:04.905 --> 00:05.806
What do you want?

00:05.839 --> 00:07.041
A foot rub.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.278
I'll...

00:10.311 --> 00:11.712
I'll settle for coffee.

00:11.745 --> 00:15.249
( panting )

00:15.283 --> 00:16.717
I'm Gillian.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.152
I was working with Luka
and John in the Congo.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.387
Ah.

00:19.420 --> 00:20.454
John asked Luka
to give you this.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.822
He wrote me a letter?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.757
I think he wanted to try
and explain why he stayed.

00:23.791 --> 00:25.126
I don't want to talk
about Carter anymore.

00:25.159 --> 00:25.793
Why are you mad?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.561
I'm not mad.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.330
I'm sure you'll find yourself
a new bang-buddy.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.798
Good night.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.366
You're not her doctor;
you're her nurse.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.401
When I ask you not to do
something, don't do it.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.035
I hate my job.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:11.305 --> 01:13.141
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need a paper.

01:16.810 --> 01:17.845
We're closed.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.480
Come on, man.
Show me some love.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.481
Come on.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.717
Ah.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.386
Old news by now.

01:33.361 --> 01:36.564
So she's had her bath?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.300
Good. Good.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.603
Yeah, could you put her on for
me, so I could say good night?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.175
( sighs )

01:49.777 --> 01:51.312
Oh.
Um, okay then.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.248
Well, give her a kiss good night
for me then

01:54.282 --> 01:57.185
and, uh, I shall see you
in the morning.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.922
No, I won't work too hard.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.525
Yeah, okay. Bye.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.362
Everything okay?

02:08.395 --> 02:10.198
Yeah.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.200
She's watching Clifford.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.235
Hmm.

02:14.268 --> 02:18.239
You know, everyone's
allowed a little downtime.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.208
Even Ella's mother.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.581
You disagree?

02:27.615 --> 02:31.319
I don't know.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.788
It's just sneaking
out of the house like this--

02:34.822 --> 02:37.625
it all feels
a little...

02:37.658 --> 02:40.494
unseemly.

02:40.528 --> 02:44.532
You say unseemly. I say sexy.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.267
That, too.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.569
Not to mention fun.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.405
Our shift starts in...

02:51.439 --> 02:52.606
My car's fast.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.974
You've just had a shower.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.309
Water's cheap.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.944
You're half-dressed.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.946
You're not.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.720
Mr. Drake in Two is waiting
on his second troponin.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.456
Psych needs to evaluate
the woman in Four

03:08.489 --> 03:10.591
who says she's been pregnant
for the past seven years.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.660
Eloise is back?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.962
Yup, with the mother
of all yeast infections.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.398
I gave her a Fluconazole/Haldol
cocktail.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.832
Frequent flyer?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.968
Logs in more hours than me,
which is saying something.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.002
Have we met?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.571
No.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.938
Damn, is everybody new
around here or what?

03:24.972 --> 03:26.006
Fresh out of nursing school.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.475
Or fresh off the boat.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.310
I haven't seen
anything like this

03:29.343 --> 03:30.911
since shore leave in Manila.

03:30.944 --> 03:31.912
Think fast, truant.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.347
You still here, wheezy?

03:33.381 --> 03:34.715
Oh, hell, yeah.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.284
Home sweet home
and right on time, buddy.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.387
No, see, this is mi casa,
not su casa.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.522
Remember, you're just visiting
from Whitebread, Iowa,

03:41.555 --> 03:42.756
or wherever you're from.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.292
That's Whitebread, Florida,
actually.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.626
Hey, Pratt.

03:45.659 --> 03:46.594
Is there a warfarin-
phenobarb interaction?

03:46.627 --> 03:47.861
Up the warfarin because

03:47.895 --> 03:49.763
you've got increased
hepatic metabolism.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.733
Secondly, I'll more than make up
for being a few minutes late.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.902
And third, I'm not your buddy.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.970
Hey, Coop, Cubbies,
Friday night,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.739
behind home plate,
you and me?

03:58.772 --> 04:00.040
Hell, yeah.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.041
Suds and dogs?
I'm there, Daddy.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.042
Cool.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.911
You two gonna kiss next?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.813
Ortho on line one for you.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.982
Well, unless there's a phone
in the can, take a message.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.551
Uh, Pratt.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.486
We have a rectal
mass guy in Two

04:12.520 --> 04:14.322
personally asking for you.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.055
Dr. Pratt, I have a man with
urticaria I need to present.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.458
You're going to have
to give me a minute.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.492
And can you supervise
my pelvic exam?

04:18.526 --> 04:19.459
Yeah, all right, in a sec.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.793
What's the dose of IV Reglan?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.330
Damn, how many of you newbies
are there?

04:22.330 --> 04:23.664
That mean med students?
There are lots of us.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.065
Yeah. Well, am I
the only second-year here?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.033
I'm sorry.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.601
I didn't see Dr. Cooper.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.437
I would've asked
Dr. Morris, but, uh...

04:29.470 --> 04:31.605
COOP:
He's stuck
with a patient in Two.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.341
The sprained ankle?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.877
Damn it, Morris, I have
30 patients on the rack

04:36.910 --> 04:38.679
and 40 in Triage.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.614
A little multitasking
on your part would be helpful.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.584
Hey, you're not doing
that clown any favors

04:43.617 --> 04:45.018
by picking up his slack.

04:45.052 --> 04:47.521
Okay, not a single chart's
been picked up

04:47.555 --> 04:49.056
in the past 45 minutes.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.624
It's called a work ethic,
people.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.360
Since when is
Weaver on graveyard?

04:52.360 --> 04:53.594
God forbid you should
take a patient

04:53.627 --> 04:54.828
the last hour
of your shift.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.929
You might have to stay
an extra 20 minutes.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.698
Once a month.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.367
She says it's the only way
to keep up her skills.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.968
I worked all day, too.
You think I'm not tired?

05:01.001 --> 05:03.937
Never thought I'd say this,
but I kinda miss Little Stumpy.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.040
Pratt, you forgot to sign
your QA forms last night.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.543
MAN:
Get me out of here!

05:09.577 --> 05:10.911
You want to grab
this first?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.012
I'm off the clock.

05:12.045 --> 05:12.880
Come on, you
heard Weaver.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.515
Open tibia fracture

05:14.548 --> 05:15.916
after a motorcycle accident
three hours ago.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.050
I never gave permission
for this!

05:17.084 --> 05:17.818
You have his films?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.620
Right here.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.788
Name's Mathers and he's
not a happy camper.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.390
How you doing,
Mr. Mathers?

05:22.390 --> 05:23.457
I don't want to be
in this hellhole!

05:23.491 --> 05:24.758
That's how I'm doing!

05:24.792 --> 05:26.527
St. T's shipped him
because they...

05:26.560 --> 05:27.861
They dumped me
'cause I don't have insurance.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.897
You're here, sir,
because you require

05:29.930 --> 05:32.966
a higher level of care
than they're capable of giving.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.402
I work for a living,
damn it!

05:34.402 --> 05:35.536
I'm not
some county welfare case.

05:35.569 --> 05:36.970
Hey!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.539
This look like TV to you?
What are you doing?

05:38.572 --> 05:39.773
Had a gram of Ancef
and six of MS.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.409
God, I deserve
better than this...

05:41.442 --> 05:42.743
No, the best thing that
could've happened to you

05:42.776 --> 05:43.744
was coming to County.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.978
You're about to receive

05:45.012 --> 05:46.747
the finest health
care in Chicago.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.882
Isn't anyone going to help
deliver my precious baby?!

05:48.916 --> 05:50.984
Eloise, you've been pregnant
for seven years,

05:51.018 --> 05:52.420
you can wait ten more minutes.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.054
All right, listen up, listen up.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.155
We're the A team, people.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.024
You know what that means?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.660
That means we have exactly 12
hours to clear this place out

05:59.693 --> 06:02.430
and show those quacks
at the day shift how it's done.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.484
WOMAN:
Most people are quite pleased
with its lifelike appearance

06:56.517 --> 06:58.686
and the attention
paid to detail...

06:58.719 --> 06:59.953
Yeah, well, they should've
clipped my nails then.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.622
With a minimum of motion,

07:01.655 --> 07:04.592
your own muscle signals will
trigger the arm, so that...

07:04.625 --> 07:07.495
Yeah, I read the brochure.
Let's go.

07:07.528 --> 07:11.932
To bend the arm, simply
contract your biceps.

07:11.965 --> 07:13.501
That's it.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.704
Biceps up, triceps down,
biceps up, triceps down.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.739
They actually pay you
to state the obvious?

07:18.772 --> 07:23.043
Okay, pausing, as you just did,
causes the arm to lock.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.578
How do you unlock it?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.580
Well, it requires
a quick co-contraction,

07:26.614 --> 07:27.981
but that's too advanced for now.

07:28.015 --> 07:28.982
No, we're not ready

07:29.016 --> 07:30.017
to move on
to the hand yet.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.018
We don't have to.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.553
Look, how do you put it on?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.187
Donning and doffing are
much more complex tasks.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.590
Harness first
or stump in the socket?

07:36.624 --> 07:37.658
Dr. Romano, it's late...

07:37.691 --> 07:39.593
I want my damn arm,
all right?!

07:39.627 --> 07:41.829
I've waited long enough!
Let's go.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.264
MATHERS:
Screwy thing is
if I was on welfare,

07:44.297 --> 07:46.600
Medicaid would've
covered me there, right?

07:46.634 --> 07:47.535
Right.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.002
Now, remember.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.905
Open fractures can lead
to gram-negative osteomyelitis,

07:51.939 --> 07:53.674
which is why we
add gentamycin.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.543
Veins are sclerosed.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.544
Excuse me.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.012
Ever use IV drugs, Mr. Mathers?

07:59.046 --> 08:00.714
Years ago.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.682
Doesn't mean I should
be butchered at County.

08:01.715 --> 08:02.783
You're absolutely right.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.984
And that's why we're going

08:04.017 --> 08:05.252
to have our best
work your central line.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.554
Neela?

08:06.587 --> 08:07.588
Right.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.723
Wait, what is she?
Ten?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.058
No, almost 16.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.093
Lester, I need you
to call Ortho.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.629
Tell them that Dr. Pratt's
open fracture patient

08:15.663 --> 08:16.997
needs to be
in the OR no later

08:17.030 --> 08:18.566
than three hours
from now.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.667
It was a pleasure
working with you, sir.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.569
Doesn't she need
to be supervised?

08:21.602 --> 08:22.269
( sighs )

08:22.302 --> 08:23.604
Hey, Mike.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.272
Can you spot this one
for me, man?

08:25.305 --> 08:26.907
Hey.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.275
What?

08:28.308 --> 08:29.710
I've had to take a whiz
since I got here.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.081
Freddy!

08:34.114 --> 08:36.283
Freddy, if you don't get up,
you're going to lose your gurney

08:36.316 --> 08:37.618
and spend the night
on the floor.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.787
But I like a firm mattress.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.221
PRATT:
What's his blood alcohol?

08:41.254 --> 08:43.591
429 but it smells
a lot higher.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.658
He ain't going anywhere
on his own.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.259
Come on, up you go, Freddy.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.895
FREDDY:
Anybody ever tell you
you're beautiful?

08:47.928 --> 08:49.329
Yeah, all the time.
Come on.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.298
Mag and thiamine, keep
him till he's sober

08:51.331 --> 08:53.734
and tell housekeeping
there's vomit in the hall.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.302
I think I'm going
to be sick.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.937
She new?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.706
She's wearing white
pants, isn't she?

08:58.739 --> 08:59.607
Why? You want
to date her?

08:59.640 --> 09:00.774
Hey, hold on now.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.610
I thought things were
good between us.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.645
You know, cards on the table,
no hard feelings...

09:04.678 --> 09:05.646
We talked about this.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.648
Oh, none whatsoever.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.616
WEAVER:
Pratt.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.817
Ready for you to present.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.051
Okay, let me take
a leak first.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.285
No.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.254
Rick Mathers, open tib
on Ancef and gent

09:14.287 --> 09:16.757
awaiting Ortho for a washout
and ORIF.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.892
He has a history of IVDA,
needs a central line.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.193
Better have more than that.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.731
Exam 4, ureteral colic
waiting on a CT urogram,

09:23.764 --> 09:25.098
pain-free with Toradol.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.066
How's his
renal function?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.268
BUN 15,
creatinine 1.1.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.171
Curtain 2, febrile PID,
got foxy-doxy.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.273
She's being admitted to GYN.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.142
And in here, we've got
Betsy Wimbel, 28,

09:35.175 --> 09:36.710
exacerbation
of Crohn's disease

09:36.744 --> 09:38.311
with abdominal pain
and diarrhea.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.246
Percocet's
not touching her.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.648
It's cramping again.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.850
Another 100 of Demerol
for Betsy, please.

09:42.883 --> 09:43.817
Steroids?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.285
Gram of Solumedrol.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.788
And I called GI to get her
admitted for intractable pain.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.658
Sounds good.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.192
Yeah.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.794
Should be going upstairs
any time now.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.062
Thank you, Dr. Pratt.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.730
I appreciate your going
to bat for me.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.731
Oh, it's nothing.

09:57.765 --> 09:58.732
Anything for you, Betsy.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.867
I like your style, man.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.868
Oh, yeah?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.703
Well, get your own.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.804
Numb it! Numb it!

10:03.837 --> 10:05.806
Hold still,
Mr. Mathers.

10:05.839 --> 10:06.940
We're almost done.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.075
You aiming
for the sternal notch?

10:08.108 --> 10:08.942
( wailing in pain )

10:08.976 --> 10:10.210
Still no flash.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.812
All right, you're
too inferior.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.046
Aim more cephalad.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.982
No, she has to avoid
the subclavian artery.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.283
NEELA:
I know, I know...

10:16.316 --> 10:17.284
Ow! God!

10:17.317 --> 10:18.218
Here, let me try it.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.419
No.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.754
Are you following
the landmarks?

10:20.788 --> 10:21.288
Yes!

10:21.321 --> 10:22.656
Oh, God!

10:22.690 --> 10:23.957
CHEN:
What's going
on in here?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.225
They're stabbing me
to death here!

10:25.258 --> 10:27.094
Four attempts at a central line.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.295
Here, I'll take that.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.730
What, a Chink now?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.398
What is this,
the damn UN?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.800
You aim above

10:32.833 --> 10:35.302
and posterior
to the index finger

10:35.335 --> 10:36.670
in the sternal notch.
Hello.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.305
( screaming ):
Oh, God.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.808
RASGOTRA:
I thought I was.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.810
Advancing...

10:42.843 --> 10:44.812
Got a flash.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.680
Guidewire.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.749
I guess I'm more comfortable
with the IJ approach.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.183
Well, you need
to learn them both.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.118
( Mathers moaning )

10:51.151 --> 10:52.953
All right, I'm in.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.023
Oh, thank God somebody here
knows what they're doing.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.357
Gallant, can you
sew it in for me?

10:57.390 --> 10:58.358
I was off an hour ago.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.659
Me, too.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.763
She hates me, doesn't she?

11:02.796 --> 11:05.432
Who? Dr. Chen?

11:05.465 --> 11:07.134
She thinks I'm interested

11:07.167 --> 11:09.269
in her boyfriend,
but I'm not.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.738
( chuckles )

11:10.738 --> 11:12.239
Should I talk to her?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.741
I would leave
it alone.

11:13.741 --> 11:14.842
They broke up.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.977
She and Dr. Pratt?
When?

11:17.010 --> 11:19.412
Last week.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.848
Let go of my sleeve, Freddy.

11:20.881 --> 11:21.749
But I love you.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.183
Dr. Chen?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.318
Let's see if you feel that way
in the morning.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.486
Another two of lorazepam.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.188
Do you have a moment?

11:28.221 --> 11:30.257
Uh, actually,
I'm on my way out.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.192
Put Freddy in Curtain Two

11:32.225 --> 11:34.962
and give him to Dr. Morris,
wherever he is. Thank you.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.064
It's just that I think
we got off on the wrong foot

11:37.097 --> 11:38.932
and I'd very much
like to remedy that.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.801
What?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.469
Dr. Pratt's
a bit of a flirt,

11:42.502 --> 11:44.972
of which I'm sure
you're well aware,

11:45.005 --> 11:48.308
but I want you to know,
I did nothing to bring it on.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.278
In fact, I think
he rather can't help himself.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.946
But if I did anything

11:52.980 --> 11:55.315
to worsen the situation,
I apologize,

11:55.348 --> 11:57.184
and I'd hope
you wouldn't penalize me

11:57.217 --> 11:58.986
over something
which I had no control.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.120
Penalize you?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.454
Be hard on me.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.456
Show me up
in front of the others.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.959
Um... look...

12:07.327 --> 12:09.429
Neela.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.164
I'm hard on all
my med students,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.900
especially the women,
because I have to be,

12:12.933 --> 12:14.267
for their own good.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.137
If I were you, I'd worry
more about my skills

12:17.170 --> 12:19.406
and less about Dr. Pratt.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.181
All right,
Mr. Coston's discharged;

12:28.215 --> 12:30.017
Mrs. Provost,
admitted to Cards;

12:30.050 --> 12:31.819
Lemony Jones is AMA
and don't bother me

12:31.819 --> 12:33.520
unless you've got
some money for me, please.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.088
FREDDY:
* You put
your right hand in *

12:35.122 --> 12:36.189
Who's got big mouth Freddy?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.324
* You put your right hand out

12:37.357 --> 12:38.525
Chen assigned him
to Morris.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.027
Yeah, well,
he's mine now.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.161
* You put
your right hand in *

12:41.194 --> 12:42.429
* And you shake it all about

12:42.462 --> 12:44.197
* You do the hokey-pokey

12:44.231 --> 12:46.199
Keep pushing Ativan
till he shuts up.
Yeah, right.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.001
* Turn yourself around...

12:48.035 --> 12:48.902
Geez!

12:48.936 --> 12:49.502
One more patient.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.071
No, not now. Later.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.405
No, wait, please.
You won't even have

12:52.439 --> 12:53.907
to go very far.
He's right over here.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.042
His name is, uh...
Hey, stop.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.543
Okay? Just stop.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.546
Betsy, nobody's been in
to see you yet?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.215
( strained ):
No. Is it going
to be much longer?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.017
Well, let me get
on the horn to GI,

13:04.051 --> 13:06.854
and tell them my girl's tired
of waiting on her consult, okay?

13:06.887 --> 13:07.988
ANDY:
Um, can I talk now?

13:08.021 --> 13:09.222
Yeah, go ahead.
Ed Gamble, 28,

13:09.256 --> 13:10.858
developed
an expressive aphasia

13:10.891 --> 13:12.225
while fighting
with his wife.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.526
Stopped talking
mid-sentence.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.394
It was all
very dramatic.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.462
I can talk now though.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.464
Have you done a
full neuro exam?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.900
No, but my husband
passed the idiot test
with flying colors.

13:19.933 --> 13:20.901
( knocks on window )

13:20.934 --> 13:22.435
Excuse me.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.204
What's up?
Weaver knows,
but just in case,

13:24.237 --> 13:25.538
dislocated shoulder,

13:25.572 --> 13:26.907
check post-
reduction film.
Mm-hmm.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.141
Pancreatitis,
30 of morphine,

13:28.175 --> 13:29.576
just make sure
he's breathing.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.544
And I'm out of
here unless you
need me to stay.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.612
Now, why would
I need that?

13:32.645 --> 13:34.247
Because it's crazy-busy

13:34.281 --> 13:36.116
and there's only one
attending on the floor?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.550
Nah, got it this.
I was hoping
you'd say that.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.419
For you.
And Morris is MIA.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.554
He's got an LOL waiting on
a pelvic for over 14 hours now.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.522
Okay.
You leaving?

13:42.555 --> 13:43.957
Yeah, finally.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.992
PARAMEDIC:
73-year-old female,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.459
chronic emphysema on home 02.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.361
Told her granddaughter
she couldn't breathe.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.596
Kid called 9-1-1.

13:49.629 --> 13:50.964
Ma'am, what's
your name?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.232
Winnie Crawford,
that's her name.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.566
COOP:
She's not moving air.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.235
Okay, let's get Miss Crawford
into Trauma One.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.269
Abby?

13:56.303 --> 13:57.404
Uh, my shift's over.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.638
You.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.941
You want to be a doctor?
Move it!

14:00.974 --> 14:05.378
Um, by the way,
uh, your loan's
not going to go through.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.414
Not with a FICO of 428.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.917
They gave you my credit rating?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.219
I saw the application
on the fax.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.221
Couldn't lease a moped
with a score that low.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.591
WEAVER:
Get her on 100%
non-rebreather.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.060
Is Grandma okay?

14:20.093 --> 14:21.294
We're trying
to help her.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.630
Hang a liter of saline.
We have an IV yet?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.298
GIRL:
She doesn't like hospitals.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.434
DUVATA:
Working on it.
Pressure's 86/52.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.269
Don't do that!

14:29.302 --> 14:30.537
I need a 7-0 tube
and a Mac 3.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.105
Stop it!

14:32.139 --> 14:33.440
Okay, someone get her
to the family room.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.475
She wouldn't like it.
She's DNR!

14:37.544 --> 14:39.612
What did you say?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.181
WEAVER:
Sweetie,

14:41.214 --> 14:42.549
do you know what DNR means?

14:43.650 --> 14:46.153
She doesn't want to be naked.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.154
( Coop sighs )

14:49.289 --> 14:51.358
Hypoxic on 15 liters,
respiratory failure.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.692
We have to tube her.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.627
Not if she's DNR.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.596
The child wouldn't know the term
unless it had been discussed.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.098
It doesn't matter.
Without documentation,

14:58.131 --> 14:59.499
we resuscitate.
Am I right?

14:59.532 --> 15:01.201
Put her on a vent,
she'll never come off.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.070
Morphine and oxygen
until we know different.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.105
Erica, do you know
where your parents are?

15:05.138 --> 15:08.308
My mom's out with her boyfriend.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.243
Okay, take her
to the family room.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.211
Get a number
for the mom.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.279
Come with me, all right?

15:13.746 --> 15:15.582
Okay, shut your eyes
and don't let me open them.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.017
You think it's bad?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.318
I asked for a divorce.
You didn't ask.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.987
And he starts
with the mute act,

15:20.020 --> 15:22.189
which is a childish variation
on his cold shoulder act.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.190
( knocking )

15:23.223 --> 15:24.157
Sorry to interrupt.

15:24.191 --> 15:24.992
Excuse me.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.326
Jeez.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.528
Intubated benzo overdose,
waiting for an ICU bed.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.563
Radiator fluid burn needs
Thermazine dressings.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.267
Incised thrombosed
hemorrhoid needs to
go home for sitz bath.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.069
So, what are you
telling me for?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.370
Those are all Morris'.
Man, I've been
up and down

15:37.404 --> 15:39.006
this hallway;
I cannot find him.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.373
Plus, I'm late for
dinner with my folks.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.042
All right,
give it to me.
Thank you.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.043
Have a good night.
Yeah.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.211
He's doing it again.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.345
He's doing what?

15:45.378 --> 15:46.546
Not talking.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.215
Look, obviously,
this is Ed's way

15:48.248 --> 15:50.350
of keeping me hooked.
That or he's really lost it.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.518
Either way, he needs help.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.386
Okay.
Thank you.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.055
Hey, I need you
to do me a favor.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.456
I need you to call Psych

15:56.489 --> 15:58.291
for a consult
on Mr. Gamble.
Yes, Doctor.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.592
Dr. Pratt?
What?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.228
I have a patient
who was bit by a rat.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.362
All right, come on.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.530
Should I send off a CBC?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.531
For what, rabies?

16:04.564 --> 16:06.566
Nurse?
Come on.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.235
That woman blew her nose
on my smock.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.569
Well, maybe she's
not a Tweety fan.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.271
Hey, I need you
to update his tetanus

16:11.304 --> 16:12.772
and I need you to test
his flexor tendons.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.141
No, don't test me, man.

16:14.174 --> 16:15.575
Just test the rat.
( screams )

16:15.608 --> 16:17.510
This is not what I went
to nursing school for.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.645
I quit.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.080
Irrigate. Put
him on Keflex

16:20.113 --> 16:21.281
and chuck the rat
in the bio bin.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.615
I've got to take another piss.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.051
Dr. Pratt, I've got a lady
with dysmenorrhea.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.418
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Here, take that.

16:25.452 --> 16:26.519
Prostate pain and a
baby with a impetigo?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.488
MORRIS:
If it's obstruction,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.590
what would the
diameter be?

16:30.623 --> 16:32.092
Ten mill... so then
over ten millimeters

16:32.125 --> 16:34.061
then I should
call surgery?

16:34.061 --> 16:36.329
Son of a bitch.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.066
Hang up!

16:39.099 --> 16:40.200
What?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.134
You're
a second-year resident,

16:41.168 --> 16:42.535
not a med student.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.404
You can't be calling
your mother, your father

16:44.437 --> 16:45.572
or your cousin
who's a podiatrist

16:45.605 --> 16:46.806
to help get through a shift.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.075
Now get out on the floor

16:48.075 --> 16:50.277
and do your damn job!

16:50.310 --> 16:53.513
And for God's sake,
light a match or something.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.453
( opens door latch )

17:00.487 --> 17:02.089
Hi.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.256
Hey.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.092
Figured I owed
you a visit.

17:05.092 --> 17:08.494
And... Gillian invited me
for dinner.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.130
It's 10:00.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.798
Well, I didn't think
you'd take me up on it.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.099
Oh.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.334
Uh, sorry,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.435
I can't stay,
uh, but there's still

17:16.469 --> 17:18.771
some Thai left in the fridge,
if you want.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.743
Uh, see you in a couple months.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.152
Thanks.
Okay.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.587
Need any help with that?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.588
No, no, I'm good.

17:35.622 --> 17:38.425
Um, bye, Abby.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.134
Where's she going?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.268
Ah, back to Montreal.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.273
Her boyfriend's been bugging her
to go back home.

17:54.674 --> 17:55.842
I thought you two were...

17:55.875 --> 17:57.677
Nah, it's
complicated.
Mm.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.579
PRATT:
This guy Mathers

17:59.612 --> 18:00.647
is approaching
the six-hour mark.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.282
He needs a washout in the OR.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.816
or he's going to get
some serious osteo...

18:03.850 --> 18:05.818
Yeah, well, we're a little busy
down here, too.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.820
Dumb...
Your acute abdomen
is acutely constipated.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.556
Give him an enema
and some Colace.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.224
Now, how did I know
you were going to say that?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.725
Because you know you
shouldn't have bothered

18:12.759 --> 18:14.194
to call me down in
the first place?

18:14.227 --> 18:15.562
Hey, I got a board to clear.
Yeah, yeah.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.297
Look, put a fresh
saline dressing

18:17.330 --> 18:19.532
on my open fracture
guy, would you?
Yes, Doctor.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.602
You do speak
English, right?
Yes, Doctor.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.505
( sighs )

18:25.538 --> 18:27.340
All right, looks like
we're making progress.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.808
Only 30 on the board.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.343
And 50 in Triage.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.678
So we better fuel up.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.680
Feel like making a
burger run, my treat?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.482
Cafeteria's closed.
McDonald's isn't.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.450
You got feet.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.518
Excuse me, Doctor?

18:38.551 --> 18:39.919
Oh, I see you're
talking again.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.454
It sort of comes and goes.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.556
Were you able
to determine anything?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.193
No, not yet, but we
got a special doctor
coming to see you,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
so you better get into
bed before you miss him.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.397
So, you think
it's just stress?
I don't know.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.399
You pulled me out of a movie
for Betsy Wimbel?

18:52.432 --> 18:53.800
Is there a problem?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.602
Yeah, she's in here
three times a month

18:55.635 --> 18:58.238
with the same complaints
and still somehow manages

18:58.271 --> 18:59.806
to squeeze Demerol out
of residents like you

18:59.839 --> 19:01.708
who don't pull
her old charts.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.211
Yeah, that's all fine and dandy,
but she's got real disease--

19:04.244 --> 19:05.745
guaiac-positive stool
and intractable pain.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.347
She's a manipulative
drug-seeker

19:07.380 --> 19:08.715
and we are not here
to support her habit.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.583
So examine her,
put a note in her chart

19:10.617 --> 19:12.219
stating that you won't admit.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.455
Bump her steroids,
give her a few Vicodin

19:15.488 --> 19:17.890
and do not call me again.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.527
I'm just asking you
to take care of your patient.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.529
Actually, she's
your patient now.

19:24.764 --> 19:28.235
Hey, Lester.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.238
Medicate and discharge
my Crohn's patient.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.307
Tell her you're sorry,
but she won't be admitted.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.642
ABBY:
You seem to be getting

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
your strength back.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.347
I couldn't run a
four-minute mile,
but I'm doing okay.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.815
Still a little anemic.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.984
Are you glad to be home?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.986
Yes and no.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.256
I miss it.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.991
You're not in your own head
all the time.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.560
You're a part of something

19:53.593 --> 19:55.528
that's in constant
motion over there.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.698
Any break from it
you get is a luxury,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.701
not just something to
be taken for granted.

20:01.734 --> 20:05.372
And that's different
from County how?

20:05.405 --> 20:08.241
It's its own addiction,
I guess.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.676
Yeah, it certainly
hooked Carter.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.877
Yeah.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.879
How are you doing
with that?

20:12.912 --> 20:16.683
What, without him,
you mean?

20:16.716 --> 20:18.851
I'm fine.

20:18.885 --> 20:21.721
I'm better than fine.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.456
So you're happy?

20:23.490 --> 20:25.392
( chuckles )

20:25.425 --> 20:28.395
Getting there.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.396
I made a few decisions.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.364
Like what?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.702
I don't want
to jinx myself.

20:35.735 --> 20:36.869
( pager beeps )

20:39.906 --> 20:41.708
Work wants me back.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.311
Tonight?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.979
Pretend you didn't get a page.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.383
I need the money.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.555
See you soon then?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.924
Yeah.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.929
Good night.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.705
DUVATA:
Corina Wybel
is waiting on amylase

21:12.739 --> 21:14.541
and Mathers is
still in Sutures.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.775
He didn't go up
to surgery yet?

21:15.808 --> 21:17.710
Hey,
I thought you left.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.979
What can I say?
The attrition rate
for nurses here sucks.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.548
Ha, ha, Tweety girl?

21:21.581 --> 21:23.550
Yeah, writing was on
the wall for that one.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.552
It's kind of a drag you
got called back in, though.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.986
Not really.
Double overtime.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.760
How's it going?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.630
Are you talking to me?
Yeah.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.966
Fine.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.568
Glad to hear it.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.470
You're one of the best
nurses on the floor.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.905
With all the changes that
Robert's been making,

21:45.938 --> 21:47.073
I'd, uh, hate
to lose you.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.741
Thanks.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.710
NEELA:
Abby, do you know
where I can find

21:50.743 --> 21:52.011
paper and crayons
for a little girl?

21:52.044 --> 21:53.546
Is she a patient?
No, but...

21:53.580 --> 21:55.615
Your evaluation as a med
student revolves around

21:55.648 --> 21:57.584
how many patients
you can carry,

21:57.617 --> 21:59.386
not how many children
you can baby-sit.

21:59.419 --> 22:02.855
Take a cue from some of your
colleagues and get busy.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.624
Okay, the wrist film's negative.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.893
Ace wrap and he's out of here
with RICE.
Got it.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.861
Scombroid patient
had two liters,

22:08.895 --> 22:12.064
tolerating POs, discharge
with a clear liquid diet.
Yes, sir.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.766
Threatened AB
is Rh-positive.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.135
Send her home with pelvic rest,
no intercourse,

22:16.168 --> 22:18.070
no tampons, no douching.
Thanks.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.038
( sighs )

22:19.071 --> 22:20.740
Morris.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.108
Why do I have a board
full of nasty

22:22.141 --> 22:23.776
and you're studying radiology?

22:23.810 --> 22:25.445
Uh, Damian here came
in with wheezing.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.947
Yeah, he's got a quarter
in his upper esophagus.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.081
So, what's your point?

22:29.115 --> 22:30.850
I'm thinking
it'll just pass.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.051
In my poop?

22:32.084 --> 22:33.820
So, that's it?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.488
We just wait till it comes out?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.056
No, actually,
being that he's symptomatic,

22:37.089 --> 22:39.526
we call in a specialist who can
take it out with an endoscope.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.760
Is that an operation?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.061
With no cutting involved.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.030
All right, who's the
GI consult on call?

22:44.063 --> 22:45.798
Hampton,
a very special friend of mine.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.833
You page her.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.000
COOP:
Pratt!

22:48.034 --> 22:49.135
DUMAR:
Pulse ox 98
on two liters.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.637
Street racing MVA,
first of three.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.104
Sicker one's coming in
right behind me.

22:52.138 --> 22:53.640
Witness said car
rolled three times.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.642
No, man, it was
at least four.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.009
Excuse me.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.177
Janie Timmons,
16, restrained

22:58.210 --> 22:59.646
but loose after
several rolls.

22:59.679 --> 23:01.080
Unknown LOC,
GCS 234.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.549
Janie, can you hear me?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.616
CSF out the ears.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.884
And blood in the airway.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.553
Page neurosurg
and trauma.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.720
Bet you money she's got
a bleed in her brain.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.888
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.557
Where we going?
What's open?

23:10.590 --> 23:12.692
Nothing. Uh, end-stage emphysema
in One, a possible DNR.

23:12.725 --> 23:13.860
Possible?
Yeah.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.061
Let's go.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.729
Look out.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.030
Triple MVA--
we need this room.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.499
Wait, she needs
a monitored bed.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.900
Not if she's a DNR.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.068
We're waiting
for confirmation on that.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.536
She's got end-stage emphysema.

23:23.570 --> 23:24.637
Consider it confirmed.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.105
Come on. Let's go.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.009
PRATT:
Let's go. Come on.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.744
Come on. Come on.
Out. Out.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.079
Out. Out.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.489
His '64 Mustang
lost out to a Z28.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.990
Good vitals, unknown LOC,
chest abrasion

23:44.023 --> 23:45.725
with closed fracture
of the humerus.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.059
The classic people
always challenge.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.628
WEAVER:
We'll get a C-spine

23:48.661 --> 23:50.497
in CT, but he needs a chest
and AP pelvis.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.532
That's going to
take a while.
They're slammed.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.801
Okay, if CT opens first,
we'll have to send him there.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.002
You want to go
when he does?

23:56.035 --> 23:57.737
No, I can't.
I'm the only attending

23:57.770 --> 24:00.206
and Pratt's the senior
on the floor.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.240
Abby, you go.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.942
It's my fault.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.512
They're young.
They're allowed to be stupid...

24:05.512 --> 24:07.647
No one's allowed to be
that stupid, Mr. Vangoss.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.550
I got bone sticking out
of my legs!

24:10.583 --> 24:12.952
Six Flags only better.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.887
Cranial nerves grossly intact.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.923
I've been here
six hours!

24:16.956 --> 24:18.625
MORRIS:
Somebody needs

24:18.658 --> 24:19.726
to shut him up.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.093
Oh, my God!
...cleared.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.129
Harlin was always
like a total G force, you know?

24:23.162 --> 24:24.864
Good breath sounds.
Hey, where's Janie?

24:24.897 --> 24:25.765
Yeah, you're just now asking?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.099
The belly's tender.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.535
I don't want to
inconvenience anybody.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.169
Take the rectal.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.704
What?

24:31.738 --> 24:33.039
Needs someone to find out

24:33.072 --> 24:34.941
about his girlfriend,
doesn't he?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.109
You're going up my butt?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.878
Just one finger.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.780
PRATT:
Multiple lac

24:40.813 --> 24:42.014
scalp and occiput.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.783
MORRIS:
Hey, Pratt, your
guy in Sutures

24:43.816 --> 24:44.884
is having a meltdown.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.686
Later. Looks like
a skull fracture

24:46.719 --> 24:47.820
with a step off.

24:47.854 --> 24:48.755
Sats are down to 90.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.089
Threatening to sue

24:50.122 --> 24:52.058
everybody and their brother,
but mostly you.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.060
MALIK:
Whoa, she's
blowing some teeth.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.227
Oh, wow. Hey,

24:55.261 --> 24:56.596
where the hell
you're going?

24:56.629 --> 24:57.930
Bathroom.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.131
( alarm beeping )

24:59.165 --> 25:00.867
Sats 88... 86...

25:03.069 --> 25:04.637
Okay.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.073
All right,
after I secure the airway,

25:07.106 --> 25:09.676
chest tube
and subclavian on the right.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.277
Dr. Pratt, Psych won't see
your aphasia patient

25:11.310 --> 25:13.179
unless you clear
a head CT first.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.014
The guy's freaking out
'cause his wife's leaving.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.082
He doesn't need a damn head CT.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.917
Okay, give me the tube.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.620
Okay.

25:20.653 --> 25:21.988
Pulse is down to 65.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.590
You better kick it.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.057
JERRY:
Pratt, Hampton
called from GI.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.793
She's not going
to see the quarter kid

25:26.826 --> 25:29.161
till morning, but she plans
on seeing Romano first.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.163
I'm in. Is that all she said?

25:31.197 --> 25:33.199
No, actually. She said
you're an asshole, too.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.936
Good night.

25:39.005 --> 25:40.907
Wow. If it's 1:00 in the
morning, I guess it's lunchtime.

25:40.940 --> 25:41.908
You got to try this.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.109
Mm, sure. What is it?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.276
Dinuguan.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.845
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.681
Cooked pork blood.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.249
Did I ever mention
I was half Jewish?

25:50.282 --> 25:52.318
( "I Love the Nightlife"
blaring from stereo )

25:52.351 --> 25:53.853
Hey, Randi, I'm still waiting
on Ortho

25:53.886 --> 25:55.622
for my open fracture guy.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.289
As soon as they call, you
make sure you tell them...

25:57.323 --> 25:59.659
They called. They said
that you should irrigate him

25:59.692 --> 26:01.127
because they're kind of busy
right now.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.762
Nice.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.632
Neela, find Morris and
have him supervise you

26:05.665 --> 26:06.999
on doing a poor man's
washout on Mr. Mathers.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.668
Any idea where he is?

26:08.701 --> 26:11.704
No, but that's an MSP--
med student problem.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.840
I love being an R2.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.808
So, what do you think?

26:15.842 --> 26:16.976
I think it's little loud.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.645
Well, if I have to
stay up these hours,

26:18.678 --> 26:19.846
so does everybody else.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.347
No. He hasn't gone
to radiology yet.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.715
That's the problem.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.016
High-speed MVA, blunt trauma.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.652
He really needs a belly CT.

26:25.652 --> 26:26.719
Can't you just sneak us in?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.287
Thank you.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.090
Okay, Mr. Vangoss,
we're going up to the CT room.

26:31.123 --> 26:34.761
I was 17
when that song first came out.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.729
You probably weren't
even born yet.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.798
Oh, I was around.

26:40.800 --> 26:41.901
Hi.
Hi.

26:43.035 --> 26:45.037
DORSET:
Elizabeth, hold the door.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.039
Oh, oh. We're
full, I'm afraid.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.174
Oh.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.911
Well, I'll catch the next one.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.084
He's cute.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.786
Did you guys ever
get together?

26:59.819 --> 27:01.387
Who?

27:01.420 --> 27:02.955
Dorset.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.757
Didn't he ask you
out or something?

27:06.158 --> 27:10.863
Uh, I suppose you could say
we're... dating.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.901
Really?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.268
What?

27:16.302 --> 27:17.704
What?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.739
What? You think
it's too soon?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.409
I didn't say that.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.818
I think it's too soon.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.721
I... I... I just
said he was cute.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.722
Yeah.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.757
Too soon.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.292
( groaning )

27:40.326 --> 27:42.862
You're not too good
at this, are you?

27:42.895 --> 27:45.231
It should start
to feel numb soon.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.236
What the hell
is that stuff?

27:50.269 --> 27:52.739
Sterile saline--
washes the germs out.

27:52.739 --> 27:55.908
And you're just now
getting around to this?

27:55.942 --> 27:57.810
We thought you'd be
in the OR by now,

27:57.844 --> 27:59.779
but this will buy us
an extra hour or two.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.380
Before what?

28:01.413 --> 28:02.882
WEAVER:
What do you think

28:02.915 --> 28:03.750
you're doing?

28:03.750 --> 28:04.817
Temporary washout.

28:04.851 --> 28:06.085
WEAVER:
Which is not

28:06.118 --> 28:07.887
a procedure
a med student performs

28:07.920 --> 28:09.488
without resident supervision.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.058
Oh, great, she's
not even a doctor?

28:12.091 --> 28:13.760
Stop what you're doing

28:13.793 --> 28:16.462
and tell me who the resident is
on this case.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.865
Dr. Pratt, but he asked
Dr. Morris

28:18.898 --> 28:20.499
to supervise on his behalf.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.768
So where's Dr. Morris?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.840
I'm surrounded by incompetents.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.842
MATHERS:
Hey! Hey, how do
you think I feel?

28:29.876 --> 28:30.943
This one's
been trying

28:30.977 --> 28:33.479
to kill me all night.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.981
Oh, my God.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.382
( Bob Marley's "Jammin'" plays )

28:36.415 --> 28:38.851
No mass, no hemorrhage,
normal ventricles, no shift.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.319
So he's clear?
Crystal.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.888
Hey, Mr. Gamble.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.322
Your head CT looks good.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.356
Everything's fine.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.892
So what do I do now?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.393
Well, I've arranged
for you to speak

28:47.426 --> 28:48.527
with one of our
mental health
specialists.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.429
I'm not crazy.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.231
No, you're not.
You're just
stressed and...

28:52.264 --> 28:54.934
Then give me something for that,
but don't send me to a shrink.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.502
God, the last thing
I need is

28:56.535 --> 28:58.337
for Gloria to have proof
I'm nuts.

28:58.370 --> 29:01.808
Pratt, dislocated
patella.

29:01.808 --> 29:02.942
COPD exacerbation.

29:02.975 --> 29:04.877
I and D
on a pilonidal cyst.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.980
And don't pass these off
on that idiot Morris.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.349
Look, I know you think
I'm a wuss...

29:10.382 --> 29:11.918
Mr. Gamble, I
don't have time...

29:11.951 --> 29:13.820
Just give me something
to get me through the night.

29:15.487 --> 29:19.325
Hey, I want you to give Ed here
two milligrams of obecalp IV

29:19.358 --> 29:20.860
and discharge him.

29:20.893 --> 29:21.994
Obecalp?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.830
You know what Obecalp is?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.898
Yes, Doctor.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.567
Thank you.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.036
Thank you very much.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.270
Yeah. Whatever
works, right?

29:31.303 --> 29:32.438
Yeah.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.883
Erica?

29:44.951 --> 29:48.420
What does DNR mean?

29:48.454 --> 29:51.023
It stands
for Do Not Resuscitate,

29:51.057 --> 29:54.226
which means...

29:54.260 --> 29:56.963
someone doesn't want
to be kept alive by machines

29:56.996 --> 29:58.865
if they should get very sick.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.601
Let's get you back
to the other room

30:02.634 --> 30:03.936
where you can rest.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.604
Can I stay here?

30:05.637 --> 30:08.908
She says she sleeps better
with me.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.011
Sure.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.026
Good night.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.595
Night.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.303
I'm glad you have time
for a Kodak moment.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.604
I know I sure
as hell don't.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.006
We still got 20
on the board

30:40.039 --> 30:42.374
and 35 in Triage.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.016
Sorry. She's by herself here.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.383
It's hard, isn't it?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.219
Learning where your
time is best spent,

30:53.252 --> 30:55.387
whether it's with the
patient or their family.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.489
Well, you know,
that's really rough.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.091
Now if you're done
playing house,

30:59.125 --> 31:01.961
do an I and D
on Mr. Brier's pilonidal cyst.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.496
Hey, hey.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.366
He's tough, but he's got
the goods, you know?

31:07.399 --> 31:09.168
Yeah.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.303
Yeah. Hey, have you ever
heard of Obecalp?

31:11.337 --> 31:13.305
Because I can't find it
in the PDR.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.407
It's "placebo"
spelled backwards.

31:15.441 --> 31:17.443
Oh.
Who's prescribing it?

31:17.476 --> 31:19.578
Um...

31:19.611 --> 31:22.148
Dr. Pratt.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.355
WEAVER:
Obecalp?

31:31.223 --> 31:33.092
Look, the guy's
playing games
with his wife.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.994
He gets panicky
whenever I
mention Psych,

31:35.027 --> 31:36.628
and he begs me to
give to him something

31:36.662 --> 31:37.629
to calm his nerves.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.431
So I give him saline.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.200
And it looks like
he feels a lot better.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.434
No harm, no fowl.

31:42.468 --> 31:43.702
Do you ever hear
of truth-telling?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.204
Deceptive practices?
Yeah, but he...

31:45.237 --> 31:46.438
Not only have
you breached

31:46.472 --> 31:48.007
every principle
of medical ethics,

31:48.040 --> 31:49.375
you've also opened us
up to a lawsuit

31:49.408 --> 31:50.977
if this patient finds
out what you did.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.312
MALIK:
Dr. Weaver, your MVA guy
is crashing in CT.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.082
Damn it.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.985
Hey, Severa, I guess
you better pull the plug

31:58.985 --> 32:00.319
on Mr. Gamble's Obecalp.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.288
I never gave it to him.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.457
MAN:
Doctor,

32:05.491 --> 32:07.626
how long before my son
is taken care of?

32:07.659 --> 32:09.461
Your son...

32:09.495 --> 32:10.662
Damian-- the quarter?

32:10.696 --> 32:12.064
Oh, right, right.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.000
Um, well, it looks
like the, uh...

32:14.033 --> 32:16.002
the GI doctor
who performs the procedure

32:16.035 --> 32:18.137
won't be able to see him
till the morning.

32:18.170 --> 32:19.705
Oh.
When in the
morning?

32:19.738 --> 32:22.374
I'm not sure, but he's stable

32:22.408 --> 32:24.476
and I don't see a problem.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.245
We've been here for 14 hours.

32:26.278 --> 32:27.479
No one's done a damn thing.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.215
Damian's scared
to death.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.050
She needs to get
to bed. We all do.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.118
Look, I know it's hard...

32:32.151 --> 32:33.552
This is an emergency
room, right?

32:33.585 --> 32:35.187
There's a quarter
in my son's throat.

32:35.221 --> 32:36.455
He can't breathe.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.290
Now, that's an
emergency, isn't it?

32:40.426 --> 32:42.428
( alarms blaring )

32:43.495 --> 32:45.731
What happened?

32:45.764 --> 32:47.066
He got altered,

32:47.099 --> 32:48.234
and his sats drifted down.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.435
Did you finish the scan?

32:49.468 --> 32:50.636
No.

32:50.669 --> 32:51.770
How long has
he been down?

32:51.803 --> 32:53.039
Under five minutes.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.040
Let's tube him.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.241
Pulmonary edema?

32:55.274 --> 32:56.408
More than likely.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.377
Okay, stop
compressions.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.480
Still no pulse.

33:01.513 --> 33:04.383
Never, never send an even
slightly unstable patient

33:04.416 --> 33:05.717
to CT without a doctor.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.519
You told me to bring him...

33:07.553 --> 33:09.055
I'm talking to me.

33:09.088 --> 33:10.422
I'm in.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.492
You coming?

33:13.525 --> 33:14.693
Pratt's trying the
old Foley trick.

33:14.726 --> 33:16.228
What?

33:16.262 --> 33:17.429
Yeah, that's
what's so cool.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.168
Okay, Foley and a two mac blade.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.470
All right, sats
is 96, BP steady.

33:24.503 --> 33:27.339
Mm-hmm.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.541
All right, come on.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.543
Okay, so now,

33:31.577 --> 33:35.481
what we want to do is
put this tube

33:35.514 --> 33:37.283
just past the quarter.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.585
And once
we do that,

33:39.618 --> 33:41.753
we're going to blow up
the little balloon

33:41.787 --> 33:43.522
with saline,

33:43.555 --> 33:46.758
and hopefully pull the quarter

33:46.792 --> 33:48.727
back into his mouth.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.563
Couldn't he aspirate the quarter
into his lungs?

33:51.597 --> 33:53.365
Not if I grab it first.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.402
Now, here's the
tricky part.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.570
Okay.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.572
And...

34:02.541 --> 34:04.710
presto.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.112
( laughs )

34:06.112 --> 34:07.246
Dr. Pratt.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.215
( laughs )

34:09.248 --> 34:13.452
Here. One for
the piggy bank.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.254
( laughs )

34:15.286 --> 34:18.257
( speaking Tagalog )

34:18.290 --> 34:19.525
DUVATA:
Oh, Abby,
you're back.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.527
Can you cover
for Melinda in Triage?

34:23.161 --> 34:24.463
Sure.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.433
Love to. Triage
is my personal favorite.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.467
Thanks for asking.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.168
Hey, where's Weaver?

34:30.202 --> 34:31.637
Bars are closing.
We're gonna get slammed.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.139
She's still in CT, which
means the R2s are in charge,

34:34.139 --> 34:35.574
and that scares me.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.409
You and me, man.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.610
All right, let's get
the party started.

34:39.645 --> 34:41.612
( loud music playing )

34:41.647 --> 34:44.516
You! Come on.
Come show me some love.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.252
Come here.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.659
Please tell me
it's not just 3:00.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.495
Shut the hell up!

34:56.527 --> 34:58.430
How's anybody supposed
to sleep around here?!

34:58.464 --> 35:01.633
MALIK:
Yo, Abby.
Any time now.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.701
Okay, where
are we at?

35:02.734 --> 35:04.436
Now serving #47.

35:04.470 --> 35:05.804
This is Jay-Jay.
He has a toothache.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.206
Thank you.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.540
Hey, Jay-Jay, how you feeling?

35:08.574 --> 35:09.875
Tooth hurts.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.511
Uh, when did you
first notice it?

35:12.544 --> 35:14.680
About a year ago.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.315
Excuse me.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.449
Yep, have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.650
No, we've already
been seen.

35:18.684 --> 35:19.551
My son was feeling
a little queasy

35:19.585 --> 35:20.619
in the parking lot.

35:20.652 --> 35:21.820
It might just be
the anesthesia,

35:21.853 --> 35:23.555
but could you get
Dr. Pratt to maybe...

35:23.589 --> 35:25.291
Oh, my God.
Pratt!

35:25.324 --> 35:26.625
Pratt!

35:26.658 --> 35:27.726
Damian...

35:27.759 --> 35:29.561
Here, help me
lie him down...

35:31.330 --> 35:33.232
What did he
come in for?

35:33.265 --> 35:34.600
He swallowed a quarter.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.202
Blood looks arterial.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.669
Page surgery
and vascular.

35:37.703 --> 35:39.471
Aorto-esophageal
fistula?

35:39.505 --> 35:41.240
Pratt, I need you
at Curtain One.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.842
Not now. Get a gurney.

35:47.779 --> 35:48.914
What's going on?

35:48.947 --> 35:51.350
Probable aorto-
esophageal fistula

35:51.383 --> 35:52.918
after a foreign body
removal in the ER.

35:52.951 --> 35:53.685
You did endoscopy?

35:53.719 --> 35:54.786
I used a foley.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.855
Are you out
of your mind?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.690
It worked fine. The quarter
he swallowed must've been
in there too long.

35:58.724 --> 35:59.925
Ten minutes after he was
discharged, this happens.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.693
All right,
we'll take it from here.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.296
Tran-esophogeal erosion needs
immediate aortic repair.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.432
Apparently, not all
ER residents can
walk on water.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.933
You know, you're
lucky this happened

36:07.966 --> 36:09.335
while they were
still here.

36:09.368 --> 36:10.836
Otherwise this boy
would be dead.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.349
Add five of Peep
once he's on a vent.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.569
Andy, what did the NG
aspirate show on Maloney?

36:43.602 --> 36:45.271
Uh, let me find out.

36:45.271 --> 36:46.472
Pratt!
Lungs clear.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.973
Let's get some 02
and check a D-stick.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.008
Watch it.
Syncopal episode?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.410
Only groans with a sternal rub.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.611
We were getting
ready to go

36:52.644 --> 36:53.879
and then he sort
of slumped to the floor.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.314
All right, let's
get him on the bed.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.282
One, two, three, up.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.987
All right, put him
on the monitor,

37:02.020 --> 37:02.988
and get me some vitals.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.290
I'm on it.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.291
I thought
he was kidding...

37:05.324 --> 37:05.991
Pupils asymmetric,

37:06.024 --> 37:07.393
mild ptosis.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.828
He was fine other
than being a nut case.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.897
Young, healthy guy
with transient loss of speech.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.432
SonoSite.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.401
A negative CT.
Turn that damn music off.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.736
Listen, man, I got this.
It's okay.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.471
Any risk factors
for stroke?

37:19.505 --> 37:21.373
No. Decreased tone
on the right.

37:21.407 --> 37:22.708
Oh, my God,
he had a stroke?

37:22.741 --> 37:25.744
Call CT.
Have them clear a room.

37:25.777 --> 37:26.778
Uh, I think I have
something here.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.946
This is my patient,
all right?

37:27.979 --> 37:28.914
Might be
a carotid dissection.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.016
Let me see that.

37:35.487 --> 37:36.988
Tapering occlusion
of the left carotid.

37:37.022 --> 37:38.657
What is that?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.326
Your husband has a tear
in one of his main arteries

37:40.326 --> 37:41.660
which caused a clot.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.395
Dr. Pratt, your open-
fracture patient demands

37:43.429 --> 37:44.563
to be euthanized.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.997
Mr. Mathers
is still here?

37:46.031 --> 37:47.399
Go. I got your
back on this.
Get consent for TPA.

37:47.433 --> 37:51.002
.9 migs per kig.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.038
Okay.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.706
That enough of Triage.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.342
Let it be someone else's turn
for a change.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.709
( speaking Tagalog )

37:57.743 --> 37:59.478
And I know
you're talking about me.

37:59.511 --> 38:00.579
Hey, Abby,
is Exam Two open?

38:00.612 --> 38:03.415
I'm on a break.

38:16.395 --> 38:23.902
Hi, uh, I'd like to find out
if I qualify for a cash advance.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.372
Uh, uh, sorry,
I have to go.

38:50.962 --> 38:52.398
Neela.
Yes?

38:53.965 --> 38:56.802
Grandma's dead.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.036
The little girl's sleeping.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.738
We need the bed.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.423
Hey, how you doing?

39:18.957 --> 39:21.660
Sleepy.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.662
Morphine's kicked in.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.965
That and it's 4:30
in the morning.

39:28.767 --> 39:31.102
Am I gonna lose this thing
or what?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.907
My leg.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.443
No.

39:39.978 --> 39:41.913
'Cause I'm...

39:41.947 --> 39:44.483
not the kind of guy
who could get along without it.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.618
I work for a living, you know.

39:46.652 --> 39:49.988
Look, I know
I've said it before,

39:50.021 --> 39:52.691
but we're gonna get you
in the OR real soon.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.596
That's what I hear...

40:07.506 --> 40:08.807
Get Coop to cover for me,
would you?

40:08.840 --> 40:09.775
Where do you think
you're going?

40:09.808 --> 40:11.042
To take care of something

40:11.076 --> 40:12.478
that should've been done
eight hours ago.

40:12.511 --> 40:13.579
Starts screaming bloody murder,

40:13.612 --> 40:15.681
right in the middle
of the course.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.516
Makes you wonder
what he would've done
if he were four over par.

40:17.549 --> 40:19.885
Hey, how you guys doing?
Dr. Pratt from the ER.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.152
Size eight-and-a-half gloves,
please.

40:21.186 --> 40:22.521
What do you think
you're doing?

40:22.554 --> 40:23.889
I'm here to hold
your retractors.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.191
Reamer to me. Drill
for the cup screws.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.027
Been calling you guys for hours
on that open tibia fracture.

40:29.060 --> 40:30.462
Well, now that I'm here to help,

40:30.496 --> 40:33.198
you can free somebody up
for the consult.

40:33.231 --> 40:34.900
Just show me where to pull.

40:39.605 --> 40:43.008
Shh, it's all right...

41:12.704 --> 41:16.908
( baby crying )

41:20.912 --> 41:24.215
( baby crying )

41:24.249 --> 41:25.216
Hello?

41:27.218 --> 41:28.219
Hi.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.590
Is Richard here?

41:31.623 --> 41:34.225
Honey,
your ex-wife is here.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.068
How old now?

41:43.101 --> 41:44.836
14 months.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.238
( toys clatter )

41:47.272 --> 41:51.810
( baby screaming )

41:51.843 --> 41:53.712
What do you want?

41:53.745 --> 41:55.581
I need a favor.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.317
Abby, it's 8:00
in the morning.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.720
Yeah, I know. I don't
have a lot of time.

42:01.753 --> 42:04.690
I need you
to co-sign a loan.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.725
Why don't you
just declare bankruptcy?

42:06.758 --> 42:09.695
Look, I'm not in trouble,
okay?

42:09.728 --> 42:10.729
I just need you...

42:10.762 --> 42:12.598
Want me to support you?
No.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.265
I never asked for alimony.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.334
I didn't contest
anything in court.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.603
I didn't even take
the damn furniture.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.070
You could have if you wanted to.

42:19.104 --> 42:21.206
Look, you must know
how much I hate doing this.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.675
I wouldn't do it unless
it was absolutely necessary.

42:23.709 --> 42:24.743
I don't want your money,

42:24.776 --> 42:27.613
I just want your signature.

42:37.689 --> 42:39.124
Oh, good morning.

42:39.157 --> 42:40.626
Yeah, hi.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.628
Yeah, I just got in
and already I've heard

42:42.628 --> 42:44.129
from the Ortho, Psych,
and GI departments,

42:44.162 --> 42:45.664
not to mention
our own Dr. Weaver

42:45.697 --> 42:47.298
about your medical
hijinks last night.

42:47.332 --> 42:48.700
The carotid clot
was a total zebra;

42:48.734 --> 42:50.669
Ortho was taking
their time;

42:50.702 --> 42:52.337
and Hampton refused
to get her lazy ass
down here for a...

42:52.370 --> 42:53.304
You are a screwup,

42:53.338 --> 42:54.205
Pratt.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.641
And just to be clear,

42:55.674 --> 42:58.176
I didn't like you
before I knew that.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.378
Mmm, Kenyan roast.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.080
Can't beat it
for flavor or punch.

43:02.113 --> 43:03.982
Triple espresso,
yes, I can.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.385
Hey, your septic pancreatitis
is still waiting on an ICU bed.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.887
Thanks.
How'd it go?

43:08.920 --> 43:10.656
Good.

43:10.689 --> 43:11.957
Hey.
Hey.

43:11.990 --> 43:13.358
How's the quarter kid?

43:13.391 --> 43:14.693
Corday says
he's gonna be fine.

43:14.726 --> 43:15.861
Hey, Coop, I heard
you caught

43:15.894 --> 43:17.663
a carotid
dissection. Nice.

43:17.696 --> 43:18.830
Thanks, man.

43:20.699 --> 43:23.001
Did a rotation with
the stroke team in June.

43:23.034 --> 43:24.803
Anybody could've missed it.

43:24.836 --> 43:28.707
Yeah, well, started Mr. Gamble
on anticoagulants,

43:28.740 --> 43:29.808
tear should heal on its own.

43:29.841 --> 43:32.077
And he keeps talking.

43:32.110 --> 43:33.311
You headed home?

43:33.344 --> 43:35.213
Yeah, why? You're not?

43:35.246 --> 43:37.683
I'm going to hit
the gym first.

43:38.884 --> 43:40.218
Hey, Coop.

43:42.353 --> 43:43.421
Thanks, man.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.224
Yeah, sure.
Anything for a buddy.
