00:13.600 --> 00:14.667
[growls]

00:14.667 --> 00:16.233
- HEY, HEY,
SATURDAY MORNING.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.433
HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE QUIET, HUH?

00:17.433 --> 00:19.767
- UH-OH,
MUCH UGLIER MONSTER.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.033
MM.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.700
[screaming]

00:22.700 --> 00:24.233
- OKAY, WATCH THE CLUBS.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.700

00:26.700 --> 00:28.533
- OKAY, NEVERTHELESS.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.500
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE NOT HELPING ANY.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.800
- THAT NOT SOUND LIKE
MONSTER TALK.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.400
- OKAY.
COME ON.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.267
- OKAY, IT'S LAST CALL
FOR BREAKFAST.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.767
- ME ALREADY
HAD BREAKFAST.

00:38.767 --> 00:41.300
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
NO MONSTER IN THE KITCHEN.

00:41.300 --> 00:42.933
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
TAKE FIVE.

00:42.933 --> 00:46.100
REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE.

00:46.100 --> 00:49.967
OH, CEREAL.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.500
- OKAY, I'M JUST GOING
TO GO HIT A BUCKET OF BALLS.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.633
BEFORE YOU KICK UP YOUR HEELS
AND SKIP TO THE CAR,

00:55.633 --> 00:59.767
JUST AT LEAST POUR THE KIDS
SOME JUICE, OKAY?

00:59.767 --> 01:01.700
- ALL RIGHT.

01:03.900 --> 01:07.233
OH, WE'RE OUT
OF ORANGE JUICE.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.533
- WHY IS THAT IN THERE?

01:09.533 --> 01:13.667
- I PUT IT BACK IN TO REMIND YOU
THAT WE'RE OUT OF ORANGE JUICE.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.733
- I'LL GET ORANGE JUICE.
- NO, THAT'S OKAY, ROBERT.

01:18.733 --> 01:20.833
- NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

01:20.833 --> 01:21.867
MOM'S FULLY STOCKED.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.133
- CAN I GO WITH YOU?

01:23.133 --> 01:24.400
- I'LL BE BACK IN A SECOND,
SWEETIE.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.533
NOW EAT YOUR BREAKFAST,
OKAY?

01:30.500 --> 01:31.967
- HE'S GREAT, ISN'T HE?

01:31.967 --> 01:35.300
- YEAH, YEAH, HE'S GREAT.
HE'S MY HERO.

01:37.467 --> 01:40.067
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.267
- YOU WON'T SEE
THE KIDS LATER.

01:41.267 --> 01:45.633
- NO?
YOU FOUND A BUYER?

01:45.633 --> 01:48.800
- ROBERT IS TAKING THEM
TO THE ZOO.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.133
- OH, YEAH?

01:50.133 --> 01:53.267
OH, WELL, THAT'S GREAT.
HE'S GREAT.

01:53.267 --> 01:54.533
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GREAT.

01:54.533 --> 01:57.667
OKAY,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.433
- WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:16.433 --> 02:18.300
- YOU SEE THE KIDS?
LOOK.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.900
- WHAT?
THEY'RE EATING.

02:19.900 --> 02:21.433
- LOOK.

02:21.433 --> 02:25.067
- OH, YEAH, IT'S CUTE
WHEN THEY DO THAT, HUH?

02:25.067 --> 02:26.167
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
WHEN THEY DO THAT?

02:26.167 --> 02:27.233
THEY DO THIS?

02:27.233 --> 02:28.700
- YOU KNOW,
ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.900
- WELL, WHY ARE THEY
DOING ROBERT'S THING?

02:30.900 --> 02:33.500
- I DON'T KNOW,
THEY LOVE HIM.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.133
- WELL, HOW COME
I NEVER SEE THEM IMITATING

02:35.133 --> 02:37.500
ANY OF MY THINGS,
WHICH ARE--

02:37.500 --> 02:41.367
THEY'RE QUIRKY
WITHOUT BEING RIDICULOUS.

02:41.367 --> 02:42.833
- LIKE WHAT?
- YOU KNOW,

02:42.833 --> 02:47.167
LIKE THE FACE I MAKE
WHEN I COMB MY HAIR.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.733
- AND IT BOTHERS YOU

02:53.733 --> 02:56.533
THAT THE CHILDREN
HAVEN'T TAKEN THAT UP?

02:56.533 --> 02:58.200
- I'M JUST SAYING THAT
IF THEY'RE GOING

02:58.200 --> 03:02.100
TO IMITATE SOMEBODY,
THEN THEY SHOULD AIM HIGHER.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.567
- WHAT, ARE YOU THREATENED
BY ROBERT?

03:04.567 --> 03:06.967
- NO.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.500
HEY, KIDS.

03:08.500 --> 03:12.800
HEY, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE STOP EATING LIKE THIS?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.900
- BUT THAT'S THE WAY
UNCLE ROBERT EATS.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.733
- YEAH, BUT WHAT UNCLE ROBERT
DIDN'T TELL YOU

03:16.733 --> 03:19.167
WAS THAT'S HOW
HE RUINED HIS FACE.

03:19.167 --> 03:22.133
- OH, WOULD YOU STOP?

03:22.133 --> 03:24.267
- SEE, LOOK, WATCH.

03:24.267 --> 03:27.233
WATCH HOW DADDY EATS.

03:27.233 --> 03:30.433
MMM, NORMAL.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.367
AND IF YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING AFTER,

03:32.367 --> 03:35.333
DO THIS.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.200
MMM.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.500
GO AHEAD, TRY THAT.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.600
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ALMOST--YEAH.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.400
- GOT IT.
- OH, ROBERT, THANKS.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.833
- YEAH,
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD MA

03:45.833 --> 03:47.233
YOU WERE
OUT OF ORANGE JUICE.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.767
SHE SAID SHE MIGHT START
CHECKING THINGS

03:48.767 --> 03:51.700
AROUND HERE MORE OFTEN.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.333
- WELL, SOMEONE
SHOULD CHECK TO SEE

03:53.333 --> 03:56.467
IF MY HEAD'S IN THE OVEN
MORE OFTEN.

03:57.733 --> 03:59.600
- ALL RIGHT, KIDS,
LET'S FINISH UP.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.767
AND THEN WHO'S READY
FOR THE ZOO-ZOO-ZOOBILY-ZOO?

04:03.767 --> 04:05.233
all: YAY!

04:05.233 --> 04:06.867
- WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS.

04:06.867 --> 04:10.200
INSTEAD OF THE ZOOBILY-ZOO,
HOW ABOUT IF DADDY TAKES YOU

04:10.200 --> 04:13.633
TO THE BETTER
ZOOBERY-ZOOGERY ZOO?

04:20.967 --> 04:22.367
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:22.367 --> 04:23.567
- OH, NOTHING,
I'M JUST THINKING

04:23.567 --> 04:24.933
THAT I SHOULD TAKE THEM
TO THE ZOO.

04:24.933 --> 04:26.533
- WELL,
I THOUGHT YOU HAD GOLF.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.833
- WELL, MY CHILDREN HAPPEN
TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOLF.

04:28.833 --> 04:32.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:32.567 --> 04:35.633
- RIGHT NOW I'M EATING
IN A NORMAL HUMAN WAY,

04:35.633 --> 04:37.600
AND THEN THE ZOO.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.533
- RAY, MAY I SEE YOU

04:39.533 --> 04:42.733
IN THE OTHER ROOM
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

04:42.733 --> 04:46.300
- YES, AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU TOO, RAYMOND.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.067
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
JUST REMEMBER--

04:50.067 --> 04:51.333
STRAIGHT TO THE MOUTH,
OKAY?

04:51.333 --> 04:55.467
YOU CANNOT WIN
IF YOU TOUCH THE CHIN.

04:57.633 --> 04:58.767
- HEY, TICKTOCK.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.967
ALL THIS IS TIME AWAY
FROM MY KIDS.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.367
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
RAY?

05:02.367 --> 05:04.067
- YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO PULL?

05:04.067 --> 05:06.100
- WHAT?
NOTHING, NOTHING.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.333
THE KIDS HAVE BEEN ASKING
TO SPEND

05:07.333 --> 05:09.100
MORE TIME WITH ME,
THAT'S ALL.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.867
- YOU'RE KIDDING.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.800
- NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.600
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.133
- OH.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.633
[chuckles]
YOU BELIEVE THIS?

05:19.633 --> 05:22.533
- RAY, THE KIDS HAVE PLANS
WITH ROBERT FOR TODAY.

05:22.533 --> 05:25.500
- YEAH, I EVEN BROUGHT SOME
GOAT FOOD FOR THE PETTING ZOO.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.600
- WHAT KIND OF GUY WALKS AROUND
WITH HIS OWN GOAT FOOD?

05:30.833 --> 05:33.467
- A GUY WHO'S PREPARED.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.933
I HAPPEN TO HAVE IT
LEFT OVER FROM LAST TIME.

05:34.933 --> 05:37.167
AND THERE'S PLENTY
IF YOU WANT TO GO WITH US.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WITH US"?

05:38.767 --> 05:41.633
IF WE GO TO THE ZOO,
IT'S YOU THAT GOES WITH US.

05:41.633 --> 05:44.333
- IS THIS
ABOUT WHO'S DRIVING?

05:44.333 --> 05:47.500
- NO, BUT, LOOK, WHY SHOULD
I HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF, OKAY?

05:47.500 --> 05:50.300
I, AS THE FATHER, THINK THAT
IT'S IN THEIR BEST INTEREST

05:50.300 --> 05:53.067
TO GO TO THE STINKING ZOO
WITH ME TODAY, OKAY?

05:53.067 --> 05:54.667
YOU CAN HAVE
THE DAY OFF.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.267
- OH, IT'S
IN THEIR BEST INTEREST, HUH?

05:56.267 --> 05:57.667
WELL, MAYBE
IT'S IN YOUR BEST INTEREST

05:57.667 --> 05:59.633
NOT TO HAVE ME THERE.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

05:59.633 --> 06:01.133
- WELL, I JUST HAPPEN TO KNOW
FOR A FACT

06:01.133 --> 06:02.700
THAT THEY REALLY ENJOY
MY COMPANY.

06:02.700 --> 06:07.067
I AM, AFTER ALL,
A WHOLE LOT OF FUN.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.067
- THEY DO ENJOY YOU,
ROBERT.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.600
- THANK YOU.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.533
- WHAT, DO YOU THINK THEY
ENJOY HIM MORE THAN THEY DO ME?

06:13.533 --> 06:17.400
- NOT JUST THEM.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.200
- WHAT, SO YOU'RE SAYING
MY KIDS PREFER YOU TO ME?

06:20.200 --> 06:21.367
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING?

06:21.367 --> 06:22.800
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU SAID IT,

06:22.800 --> 06:24.333
BUT IF YOU'RE WAITING
FOR ME TO DISAGREE,

06:24.333 --> 06:26.700
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE A SEAT.

06:28.867 --> 06:31.167
- OH, YEAH, WELL, HEY,
WHY DON'T WE JUST ASK THEM?

06:31.167 --> 06:32.967
- GO AHEAD.
- 'CAUSE I'LL ASK THEM.

06:32.967 --> 06:35.233
YOU DON'T THINK I'LL ASK THEM?
I'LL ASK THEM RIGHT NOW.

06:35.233 --> 06:39.100
- ASK AWAY.

06:39.100 --> 06:43.167
- YOU DON'T DO THAT
TO CHILDREN.

06:43.167 --> 06:44.500
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.400
YOU'RE ALL ABOUT THE CHILDREN,
YEAH.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.067
[singing]
I BELIEVE THE CHILDREN

06:48.067 --> 06:50.500
ARE OUR FUTURE--
- OH, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!

06:50.500 --> 06:53.100
- ALL RIGHT, QUIT.
COME ON. THIS IS STUPID.

06:53.100 --> 06:56.967
THIS IS STUPID.
RAY--

06:56.967 --> 06:58.300
YOU JUST GO GOLFING,

06:58.300 --> 07:00.167
AND YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
WITH THEM TOMORROW.

07:00.167 --> 07:01.533
- NO,
I WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO.

07:01.533 --> 07:04.600
- NO, YOU DON'T.
JUST GO PLAY GOLF.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.600
- NO, YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GO
GOLFING IF I DON'T WANT TO!

07:08.600 --> 07:11.600
- [laughs]
YOU ARE SO DESPERATE.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.267
- OH, YEAH,
I'M DESPERATE.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.533
THAT'S FUNNY COMING FROM YOU:
A GUY WHO HAS

07:14.533 --> 07:15.933
NOTHING BETTER
TO DO THAN GO TO A ZOO

07:15.933 --> 07:17.167
ALL SATURDAY
WITH SOME CHILDREN.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.700
- OKAY, OKAY,
SEE WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

07:18.700 --> 07:21.200
SPENDING THE DAY WITH
YOUR CHILDREN IS BORING TO YOU.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.933
- NO, TALKING TO YOU
IS BORING TO ME.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.200
- ALL RIGHT, RAY.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.133
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEBRA.
LET IT GO.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.833
IT ALL COMES
FROM FEAR.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.467
- WHAT--
FEAR OF WHAT?

07:30.467 --> 07:34.133
- FEAR THAT I MIGHT HAVE MORE
TO OFFER YOUR CHILDREN THAN YOU.

07:34.133 --> 07:36.300
- OH, RIGHT.

07:36.300 --> 07:39.300
YEAH, YOU'RE OPENING UP
WHOLE NEW WORLDS TO THEM.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.933
THE WORLD OF FEET
THAT SMELL SO BAD,

07:41.933 --> 07:45.400
YOUR NOSE HAD TO GROW AS FAR
AWAY FROM THEM AS POSSIBLE.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.767
- I JUST HAVE
ONE QUESTION.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.333
WHO DO WE HAVE A PHOTO OF AT HIS
CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS PAGEANT

07:59.333 --> 08:01.167
WEARING HEADPHONES, HMM?
- [laughs]

08:01.167 --> 08:03.067
- I THINK THAT'S
THE SAME PERSON WHO TRIED

08:03.067 --> 08:06.233
TO GET THE POSTMAN
TO BABY-SIT ONE DAY.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.767
- WHAT ARE YOU--
ARE YOU ON HIS SIDE NOW?

08:07.767 --> 08:09.833
- [laughs]
YES.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.333
- HE STARTED IT!

08:11.333 --> 08:13.667
- WHAT? HE JUST WANTED TO TAKE
THE KIDS TO THE ZOO.

08:13.667 --> 08:19.333
- YEAH, WELL, MAYBE
HE SHOULD GET HIS OWN LIFE.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.167
- NO, DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
ROBERT.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.400
RAY, APOLOGIZE.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.600
- THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT,
DEBRA.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.833
AS IT HAPPENS,
I DO HAVE MY OWN LIFE,

08:28.833 --> 08:31.833
A VERY FULL ONE.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.533
SO FOR THE SAKE
OF THE CHILDREN,

08:34.533 --> 08:36.067
I'LL JUST SLIP OUT
THE FRONT DOOR

08:36.067 --> 08:37.900
AND GO ENJOY IT.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.067
I WILL ALSO BORROW
YOUR "TV GUIDE."

08:50.200 --> 08:53.133
- STARE ALL YOU WANT.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.933
YOU--YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE STARING AT?

08:54.933 --> 08:57.167
THE PERSON
THAT'S RIGHT.

08:57.167 --> 08:59.567
YEAH, SO GO AHEAD.
JUST KEEP ON STARING.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.767
WHAT?

09:06.767 --> 09:08.867
- NOTHING.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.633
BOY, YOU'RE REALLY
ON A ROLL TODAY, HUH?

09:11.633 --> 09:13.133
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL UP YOUR FATHER

09:13.133 --> 09:16.700
AND TELL HIM HE'S MEAN
AND OLD AND FAT?

09:16.700 --> 09:20.100
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL MY FATHER.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.100
- LISTEN, I DON'T CARE
HOW INSECURE

09:22.100 --> 09:23.600
YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT KIND
OF FATHER YOU ARE.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.733
WHAT YOU JUST SAID TO ROBERT
WAS WAY OVER THE LINE.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.167
- WHAT--LOOK, HE SHOULD
GET HIS OWN LIFE.

09:29.167 --> 09:30.667
WHO IS HE
TO COME IN HERE

09:30.667 --> 09:33.800
AND TELL ME THAT
I'M BORED WITH MY OWN KIDS?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.833
COME ON, KIDS,
WE'RE GOING TO THE ZOO.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.300
- WHERE'S UNCLE ROBERT?

09:37.300 --> 09:40.100
- UM, UNCLE ROBERT HAD TO GO
DO SOME POLICE STUFF

09:40.100 --> 09:42.367
'CAUSE THERE WAS A KITTEN
THAT GOT STUCK IN A TREE,

09:42.367 --> 09:47.067
AND THEY NEED TO CLIMB UP HIM
TO GET IT.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.900
- CAN WE GO SEE UNCLE ROBERT
AND THE KITTEN?

09:48.900 --> 09:50.767
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?

09:50.767 --> 09:53.067
'CAUSE, ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT
A KITTEN; IT'S A SNAKE.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.433
- RAY.
- YEAH.

09:54.433 --> 09:55.767
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GET DRESSED.

09:55.767 --> 09:56.967
LET'S GET DRESSED
FOR THE ZOO, GUYS.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.200
COME ON, COME ON.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.667
WE'RE GOING
TO GO TO THE ZOO,

09:59.667 --> 10:04.000
AND DADDY IS GOING TO MAKE
HIS FAMOUS ZOO SNACKS.

10:30.633 --> 10:33.667
- SO THAT'S
YOUR FAMOUS ZOO SNACK?

10:33.667 --> 10:37.500
- ANIMAL CRACKERS.
PUT IT TOGETHER.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.700
- WHO TOLD ROBERT
TO GET A LIFE?

10:48.900 --> 10:50.200
- RAY?

10:50.200 --> 10:52.033
- WHAT?
IT COULD'VE BEEN YOU.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.333
- OH, RAYMOND,
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

10:54.333 --> 10:55.533
- OKAY, LOOK, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE ONLY

10:55.533 --> 10:57.233
HEARING ONE SIDE
OF THE STORY, OKAY?

10:57.233 --> 10:58.633
AND--AND YOU'RE TAKING IT
WAY OUT OF CONTEXT

10:58.633 --> 11:01.067
AND THEN BLOWING IT
WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.233
BECAUSE I WILL SAY THIS--

11:02.233 --> 11:06.367
THE THINGS HE SAID TO ME
WERE OUTRAGEOUS.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.133
- LIKE WHAT?

11:11.133 --> 11:12.500
- LIKE I AM NOT
A GOOD FATHER.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.967
- OH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:13.967 --> 11:16.600
HE SAID THAT IN MY OWN HOUSE
IN FRONT OF MY CHILDREN.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.533
- OH, HE DID NOT SAY THAT
IN FRONT OF THE KIDS.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.600
- WELL, THEY WERE
IN THE NEXT ROOM,

11:20.600 --> 11:23.500
AND--AND ROBERT HAS
THAT BIG, BOOMING VOICE,

11:23.500 --> 11:27.167
WHICH TO CHILDREN SOUNDS
LIKE GOD, OKAY?

11:27.167 --> 11:28.533
ALL RIGHT?
SO JUST,

11:28.533 --> 11:30.600
BEFORE YOU COME IN HERE
AND START ACCUSING ME,

11:30.600 --> 11:32.567
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
LOOK IN THE MIRROR

11:32.567 --> 11:36.967
WITH ROBERT
STANDING NEXT TO YOU.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.333
- YOU GO TO YOUR BROTHER
AND APOLOGIZE.

11:38.333 --> 11:39.700
- YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU,
MARIE.

11:39.700 --> 11:44.333
- I'LL FIGHT YOU BOTH.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.400
- SHE'S RIGHT, RAY.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.867
- YOU SEE, RAYMOND,
YOU DON'T KNOW

11:47.867 --> 11:49.267
HOW HURTFUL WORDS
COULD BE.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.600
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

11:50.600 --> 11:52.967
HOW YOU COME ACROSS
TO PEOPLE SOMETIMES.

11:52.967 --> 11:57.767
- AND YOU DO?

11:57.767 --> 11:59.567
- YES, YES.

11:59.567 --> 12:03.133
I'M VERY ATTUNED
TO PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

12:03.133 --> 12:06.100
I-I WOULD NEVER
THINK OF SAYING

12:06.100 --> 12:08.333
HURTFUL OR CRITICAL THINGS
TO ANYBODY.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.467
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
DEBRA?

12:17.433 --> 12:21.233
- I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU
ABOUT ROBERT.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.933
- I MEAN,
ROBERT HAS PROBLEMS.

12:22.933 --> 12:24.500
HE HAS MANY PROBLEMS,

12:24.500 --> 12:27.467
BUT--BUT HE IS
A DEVOTED BROTHER.

12:27.467 --> 12:30.200
- DEVOTED
TO BOTHERING ME.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.233
- HE LOVES YOU, RAYMOND,
AND YOUR FAMILY.

12:32.233 --> 12:33.767
HOW COULD YOU TELL HIM
TO GET A LIFE

12:33.767 --> 12:35.333
WHEN HE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR CHILDREN?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.933
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID.

12:36.933 --> 12:40.967
- BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS THAT
YOU ARE AT WORK, AT BALL GAMES,

12:40.967 --> 12:42.400
YOU LIKE TO PLAY
THE GOLF--

12:42.400 --> 12:43.867
- WHERE DO YOU THINK
HE WAS GOING THIS MORNING?

12:43.867 --> 12:45.533
- OKAY,
BUT NOW I'M NOT.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.300
- YEAH, WELL,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.167
IF IT WASN'T FOR ROBERT
DOING THINGS WITH THE CHILDREN

12:49.167 --> 12:50.567
ONCE IN A WHILE,
THEY'D BE SITTING

12:50.567 --> 12:52.333
IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION SET
ALL DAY.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.667
- BUT, LOOK, I'M TAKING THEM
TO THE ZOO, OKAY?

12:54.667 --> 12:56.100
I'VE GOT THE SNACKS.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.067
KIDS, ZOO!

12:59.733 --> 13:02.800
- MARIE, WHAT DID YOU MEAN
BY "TELEVISION ALL DAY"?

13:02.800 --> 13:05.067
- MARIE, WHAT THE HELL?

13:05.067 --> 13:06.533
ONE SECOND,
YOU WERE MAKING ME PANCAKES,

13:06.533 --> 13:08.533
THE NEXT SECOND
YOU'RE GONE,

13:08.533 --> 13:11.667
WHICH WOULD BE GREAT
IF THERE WERE PANCAKES.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.467
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR
MY DISCUSSION WITH ROBERT?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.067
HE'S HAVING A CRISIS.

13:23.067 --> 13:25.800
- SO IS MY STOMACH.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.400
- HEY, MARIE, WHEN YOU SAID
"TELEVISION ALL DAY,"

13:28.400 --> 13:30.100
YOU DON'T MEAN ALL DAY,
DO YOU?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.700
- OH, NO, NO.

13:31.700 --> 13:35.200
I MEAN, THE KIDS
ALSO HAVE SCHOOL AND SLEEP.

13:35.200 --> 13:38.300
- BUT I'M WITH THE KIDS
MOST OF THE DAY,

13:38.300 --> 13:40.333
AND I DON'T SIT THEM
IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.100
- I'M ONLY REPORTING
WHAT I SEE.

13:42.100 --> 13:45.800
- BUT THAT IS SO NOT--

13:45.800 --> 13:47.067
YOU DON'T EVEN--

13:47.067 --> 13:50.933
- HOO-HOO!

13:50.933 --> 13:52.233
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
RAY?

13:52.233 --> 13:54.767
- I'M JUST SAYING,
HOO-HOO!

13:57.067 --> 13:58.267
- YOU LISTEN TO ME.

13:58.267 --> 13:59.800
I DO NOT SIT THOSE KIDS
IN FRONT

13:59.800 --> 14:01.500
OF THE TELEVISION ALL DAY.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.400
ONCE IN A WHILE,
BECAUSE IT'S VERY DEMANDING

14:03.400 --> 14:07.267
TO BE A SINGLE PARENT,
I MIGHT JUST,

14:07.267 --> 14:09.267
TO GET MYSELF FIVE MINUTES,

14:09.267 --> 14:13.367
PUT ON AN EDUCATIONAL VIDEO
SOMETIMES.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.433
- IT SEEMS LIKE
THOSE EDUCATIONAL VIDEOS

14:15.433 --> 14:19.600
HAVE A LOT OF ANVILS
DROPPING ON PEOPLE'S HEADS.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.233
- OKAY,
WE'RE READY FOR THE ZOO.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.800
- NOT YET, KIDS.
JUST GO UP AND WATCH--

14:23.800 --> 14:26.867
JUST READ A BOOK.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.433
I JUST THINK THERE'S
A LITTLE TOO MUCH CRITICIZING

14:28.433 --> 14:30.400
OF OUR PARENTING
GOING ON HERE TODAY.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.233
- WHAT HAPPENED TO,
"I AGREE WITH YOU, MARIE"?

14:34.233 --> 14:36.700
- SO ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH
MY PANCAKES OR WHAT?

14:36.700 --> 14:39.333
I'M STARVING.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.733
- THE BATTER IS RIGHT THERE,
FRANK.

14:40.733 --> 14:43.067
YOU CAN'T POUR BATTER
ONTO A GRIDDLE?

14:43.067 --> 14:44.567
- YOU BETTER HOPE
I CAN'T.

14:44.567 --> 14:49.067
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE ON A BUS
TO THE HOME.

14:55.233 --> 14:58.067
- I WAS JUST THINKING,
INSTEAD OF ALL THAT TELEVISION,

14:58.067 --> 15:01.200
MAYBE YOU CAN DO AN ART PROJECT
WITH YOUR CHILDREN, YOU KNOW?

15:01.200 --> 15:04.067
YOU CAN MAKE A CATERPILLAR
OUT OF AN EGG CARTON.

15:04.067 --> 15:07.167
- HEY, THIS STUFF
IS PRETTY GOOD.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.200
- YEAH, UH,

15:11.200 --> 15:14.333
DAD, THOSE ARE GOAT PELLETS.

15:16.267 --> 15:20.100
- NOW, WHEN YOU SAY
GOAT PELLETS--

15:26.267 --> 15:28.467
- IT'S FOOD FOR GOATS,
FRANK.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.600
- OKAY, THEN.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.367
- WHY DON'T I GET YOU
AN EGG CARTON

15:39.367 --> 15:40.767
AND WALK YOU THROUGH
YOUR FIRST CATERPILLAR

15:40.767 --> 15:42.067
WITH THE CHILDREN?

15:42.067 --> 15:43.733
DO YOU HAVE ANY EGGS?

15:43.733 --> 15:46.667
'CAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU
RAN OUT OF ORANGE JUICE EARLIER.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.700
- [sighs]

15:48.700 --> 15:52.800
ACTUALLY, THE KIDS ARE GOING
TO THE ZOO TODAY WITH--

15:52.800 --> 15:54.333
UH, ME--
WITH ME.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.600
I'M--I'M TAKING THE KIDS
TO THE ZOO TODAY.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.633
KIDS, ZOO!
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:58.633 --> 16:00.733
I SAID I'M TAKING THEM, OKAY?
AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

16:00.733 --> 16:02.667
KIDS, I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU
AGAIN, COME DOWN HERE!

16:02.667 --> 16:04.400
- I-I'M TAKING THE KIDS
TO THE ZOO.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.100
YOU HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO YOUR BROTHER, RIGHT, MARIE?

16:06.100 --> 16:07.600
- ROBERT IS
NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.467
RAYMOND CAN TALK
TO HIM LATER.

16:09.467 --> 16:11.067
GO ENJOY YOUR CHILDREN,
RAYMOND.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.700
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU, MOM.
COME ON.

16:12.700 --> 16:16.067
- AND WE CAN MAKE
A CATERPILLAR.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.067
- GOING TO THE ZOO.
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.300
DAD, I'M GOING TO NEED
THOSE PELLETS, ALL RIGHT?

16:21.300 --> 16:25.633
- HEY, WHILE YOU'RE THERE,
SEE WHAT THE SHEEP EAT.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.067
HERE.
GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.733
- [laughs]

16:35.733 --> 16:38.333
THE BUBBLES TICKLE.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.667
HEY, HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:39.667 --> 16:43.800
THIS JET IS STRONGER.
- MM-HMM.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.167
- ROBERT?

16:45.167 --> 16:48.600
- HEY, LITTLE BRO,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.833
- HEY, YEAH, I WAS JUST GOING
TO COME BY TO TALK TO YOU,

16:50.833 --> 16:52.700
BUT MAYBE IT'S A BAD TIME.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.800
- NO, NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
WE'RE JUST HANGING.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.067
- YEAH?
UH--

16:59.067 --> 17:00.700
- OH, OH, OH,
I'M--I'M SORRY.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.467
RAYMOND, I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY NEIGHBORS.

17:02.467 --> 17:04.167
THIS IS COLLEEN AND LISA.

17:04.167 --> 17:05.700
THIS IS MY BROTHER RAYMOND.
both: HI.

17:05.700 --> 17:09.300
- HI, HI, YEAH,
I'M HIS BROTHER RAYMOND.

17:09.300 --> 17:11.467
- SO WHAT'S UP?

17:11.467 --> 17:13.200
- NOTHING, NOTHING,
I JUST--

17:13.200 --> 17:15.400
I WENT TO THE ZOO TODAY
WITH THE KIDS, YOU KNOW?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.067
- AWW!
- THAT'S CUTE.

17:17.067 --> 17:20.300
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.467
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW,
I WENT TO THE ZOO.

17:23.467 --> 17:28.133
UH, AND ANYWAY,
AT THE ZOO,

17:28.133 --> 17:29.867
I-I SAW
THESE TWO MONKEYS

17:29.867 --> 17:31.900
THAT WERE PICKING STUFF
OFF EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

17:31.900 --> 17:34.400
AND I-I STARTED
TO THINK

17:34.400 --> 17:37.767
ABOUT ME AND YOU,
YOU KNOW?

17:37.767 --> 17:39.700
'CAUSE THEY LOOKED LIKE
THEY COULD BE BROTHERS,

17:39.700 --> 17:43.067
AND I STARTED TO FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT I SAID, YOU KNOW?

17:43.067 --> 17:46.800
SO ALL I'M SAYING--
LOOK, ABOUT BEFORE, YOU KNOW--

17:46.800 --> 17:49.300
- HEY, HEY, LOOK,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, RAYMOND.

17:49.300 --> 17:50.633
YOU KNOW,
AFTER OUR LITTLE DISCUSSION,

17:50.633 --> 17:53.367
I WAS ACTUALLY FEELING
KIND OF DOWN TOO.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.067
AND THEN I RAN
INTO COLLEEN AND LISA

17:55.067 --> 17:56.367
AND REALIZED THAT
"GET YOUR OWN LIFE"

17:56.367 --> 18:00.400
WASN'T SUCH BAD ADVICE.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.633
- GLAD I COULD HELP.
- HOW WAS THE ZOO?

18:02.633 --> 18:04.100
- YEAH, DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.967
- YEAH, WELL,
IT TURNS OUT THE TWINS

18:05.967 --> 18:08.567
AREN'T REALLY INTERESTED
IN ANIMALS, YOU KNOW?

18:08.567 --> 18:10.367
BUT THEY DID FIND
A BOTTLE CAP

18:10.367 --> 18:12.533
THAT THEY THOUGHT
WAS HILARIOUS.

18:12.533 --> 18:15.667
YEAH, AND ALL ALLY WANTED
TO DO WAS SEE BABY EMU,

18:15.667 --> 18:17.633
BUT IT NEVER CAME OUT
OF ITS THING.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.400
WE SAW SOMETHING
MOVING AROUND BACK THERE,

18:19.400 --> 18:23.333
BUT I DON'T KNOW,
I THINK IT WAS JUST SOME DUDE.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.333
- OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
I'M SORRY.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.367
HEY,
WHY DON'T YOU JOIN US?

18:27.367 --> 18:30.333
- NO, NO,
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A SUIT.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.967
- WELL, WEAR MINE.
IT'S OVER THERE.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.767
[laughter]

18:35.767 --> 18:38.067
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

18:38.067 --> 18:39.700
- ROBERT,
YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.200
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
SO I'LL SEE YOU, OKAY?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.333
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU.

18:47.067 --> 18:48.867
- WELL, WAIT.
WHAT--WHAT, RAYMOND?

18:48.867 --> 18:50.600
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE?

18:50.600 --> 18:52.333
- NO, NOTHING,
IT'S NOTHING.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.867
I WAS GOING TO ASK
YOU SOMETHING, BUT NO.

18:53.867 --> 18:56.100
I MEAN, YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE, SO--

18:56.100 --> 18:57.900
- DO YOU WANT US TO GO?
- NO, NO.

18:57.900 --> 19:00.600
WE'RE FINE HERE.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.267
IT'S ALL RIGHT, RAYMOND.
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.133
- NOTHING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST--

19:05.133 --> 19:06.200
IT'S ABOUT THE KIDS.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.300
- OH, WHAT DID THEY DO?

19:07.300 --> 19:10.200
- WHAT IS IT, RAYMOND?

19:10.200 --> 19:13.167
- WELL...

19:13.167 --> 19:16.267
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID
TO ME BEFORE

19:16.267 --> 19:20.167
ABOUT HOW I FIND
BEING WITH MY KIDS

19:20.167 --> 19:24.300
SOMETIMES TO BE
KIND OF BORING?

19:24.300 --> 19:26.933
- ROBERT,
THAT'S A MEAN THING TO SAY.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.433
- I THINK IT'S TRUE.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.067
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

19:30.067 --> 19:31.333
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:31.333 --> 19:33.167
I'M A BAD GUY, RIGHT?

19:33.167 --> 19:35.267
I-I MEAN,
I LOVE MY KIDS.

19:35.267 --> 19:37.167
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THEM
WHEN I COME HOME,

19:37.167 --> 19:41.067
BUT AFTER FIVE MINUTES,
I DON'T KNOW,

19:41.067 --> 19:42.867
I'VE KIND OF HAD ENOUGH,
YOU KNOW?

19:42.867 --> 19:47.200
I WANT TO WATCH SPORTS
OR EVEN TALK TO DEBRA.

19:49.667 --> 19:50.733
- DEBRA IS HIS WIFE.

19:50.733 --> 19:52.733
- HMM, LUCKY HER.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.267
- AND THEY DID WANT TO GO
TO THE ZOO WITH YOU TODAY.

19:55.267 --> 19:56.667
I SHOULD'VE LET THEM GO

19:56.667 --> 19:59.367
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

19:59.367 --> 20:02.167
- RAYMOND,
RAYMOND, RAYMOND.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.100
I UNDERSTAND YOU
BEING BORED BY THE KIDS.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.233
THEY'RE KIDS.

20:07.233 --> 20:08.800
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

20:08.800 --> 20:11.133
I MYSELF DON'T FIND PLAYING
MONSTER FOR FOUR HOURS

20:11.133 --> 20:13.767
ALL THAT STIMULATING EITHER,

20:13.767 --> 20:15.500
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

20:15.500 --> 20:19.033
I DO IT
BECAUSE THEY LIKE IT.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.200
- YEAH.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.800
- BUT I GET TO DO SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.467
I GET TO LEAVE.

20:27.467 --> 20:30.267
SO IT REALLY WASN'T FAIR OF ME
TO COMPARE MYSELF TO YOU,

20:30.267 --> 20:32.067
WHO HAS A FULL-TIME JOB

20:32.067 --> 20:34.800
AND WHO IS A FULL-TIME DAD,

20:34.800 --> 20:37.733
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.367
- OH, THANK YOU, ROBERT.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.133
- YOU'RE WELCOME,
RAYMOND.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.333
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'M GOING TO GO.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.133
I'LL TELL THE KIDS
THAT YOU SAID HI.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.033
- GREAT.
- OKAY, BYE.

20:53.033 --> 20:55.633
- BYE.
WOW, ROBERT.

20:55.633 --> 20:58.767
NO WONDER
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD DOCTOR.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.733
- YOU SAID,
"GET A LIFE."

21:14.300 --> 21:16.933
- OKAY, WE'RE READY.
COME OUT, MONSTER.

21:16.933 --> 21:18.767
- [growling]

21:18.767 --> 21:20.233
- AAH, GET HIM!

21:20.233 --> 21:22.500
- AAH.
HOW MUCH LONGER?

21:22.500 --> 21:25.067
[all screaming]

21:25.067 --> 21:27.067
HOW MUCH LONGER?

21:27.067 --> 21:28.967
- CHASE US
TO THE CASTLE!

21:28.967 --> 21:31.167
[all screaming]

21:31.167 --> 21:33.200
- HEY.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.567
CAN'T THIS BE THE CASTLE

21:36.567 --> 21:38.900
[growling]

21:38.900 --> 21:41.700
- HURRY, HURRY, HURRY!
HE'S GOING TO GET US!

21:41.700 --> 21:44.967
- HEY, WHO WANTS TO GO SWIMMING

21:44.967 --> 21:47.300
[growls weakly]
