00:06.320 --> 00:10.600
The true pirates of the Caribbean were feared by all,

00:10.640 --> 00:14.320
and the most terrifying of them all

00:10.640 --> 00:14.320
was Francois Le Clerc.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.400
Now, in the summer of 1563,

00:18.440 --> 00:21.840
heading home from the Azores, Le Clerc and his crew

00:21.880 --> 00:26.040
came across the Spanish galleon, San Cristobal.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.000
But they soon found themselves fighting not

00:26.080 --> 00:30.000
ordinary merchant seamen

00:30.040 --> 00:33.720
but the personal guard of King Phillip II of Spain.

00:36.600 --> 00:37.680
Sorry. Carry on.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.480
Though he finally won the day

00:42.520 --> 00:45.520
and found a huge shipment of gold,

00:45.560 --> 00:49.840
Le Clerc took heavy losses and was himself badly wounded.

00:49.880 --> 00:54.680
He was forced to take refuge here, in Sainte-Marie.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.080
However, neither the treasure nor Le Clerc

00:59.120 --> 01:02.400
was ever seen again.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.680
Some people believe the treasure is still buried here,

01:05.720 --> 01:07.360
somewhere on the island. The treasure is said...

01:11.200 --> 01:12.440
...to be cursed.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.080
Cursed by Le Clerc himself.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.000
It is said that whoever disturbs the treasure that

01:18.320 --> 01:24.000
bears his blood

01:24.040 --> 01:26.280
will then join him...

01:26.320 --> 01:27.360
...in hell.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.280
Daniel!

02:48.440 --> 02:49.520
Move!

02:51.400 --> 02:53.760
No, no, no! Chris, Chris, it might not be safe!

02:55.120 --> 02:57.480
Dan! Daniel, can you hear me?

02:58.640 --> 03:00.000
Okay...

03:00.040 --> 03:01.200
Ah!

03:01.240 --> 03:03.680
All right. Chuck us down some rope!

03:10.840 --> 03:14.000
-There's been an explosion

03:10.840 --> 03:14.000
up in the rainforest,

03:14.040 --> 03:15.720
in one of the caves.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.360
One of the guys was trapped inside.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.440
-Broken his arm, gone to hospital.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.560
Treasure-hunters.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.600
Please tell me you're not serious.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.920
We've just been to the museum.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.280
Wait! You don't think that maybe...

03:29.320 --> 03:32.160
No! You're right! It could be the pirate's curse!

03:32.200 --> 03:35.160
Or maybe they were blown up by a gang of tree pixies?

03:35.200 --> 03:37.000
Okay, do you want us to come with you?

03:37.480 --> 03:38.840
BOTH: No.

03:38.880 --> 03:40.480
Look, no-one died.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.840
We'll take care of it. You enjoy the weekend.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.720
-Benjamin! -Dwayne!

04:03.760 --> 04:05.680
Long time, no see, man!

04:05.720 --> 04:07.160
You still driving the love wagon?

04:07.200 --> 04:09.560
Yeah, she's not getting much action these days, though!

04:10.880 --> 04:14.600
Ah, you really forget how beautiful it is up here.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.080
-Mm.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.960
-This explosion... -Mm.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.400
You know what happened?

04:21.440 --> 04:23.880
No, no. I heard it but I was a way away.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.760
-Yeah.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.440
They've been up here a couple of weeks.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.880
I've been fixing the truck's air con unit and stuff.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.200
Dwayne, erm, this is Daniel.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.920
He was the one that got hurt.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.880
I drove him to the hospital to get fixed up.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.560
Er, look, do you mind if we do this in the camp?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.280
I could use some painkillers.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.880
Sure.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.560
Dwayne, if you need anything, you know where I am, yeah?

04:46.680 --> 04:48.440
So, tell me, what happened this morning?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.760
Okay, so, I was packing up some of our equipment over there.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.440
Mm

04:59.480 --> 05:02.480
-I was having a shower. -I was writing up notes

04:59.480 --> 05:02.480
in the tent. So, you really looking

05:04.200 --> 05:07.200
for Le Clerc's gold?

05:09.480 --> 05:10.960
-It's what we do. -Hmm.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.920
Kind of.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.880
It authenticated around 1700, so we felt it was

05:16.960 --> 05:20.880
worth following up.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.360
It didn't mention Le Clerc by name, but...

05:23.400 --> 05:26.200
...when we found out it was Sainte-Marie...

05:26.240 --> 05:28.280
I have to admit, we got very excited.

05:32.520 --> 05:34.640
Hey, listen...

05:34.680 --> 05:36.280
This explosion...

05:36.320 --> 05:38.440
-No.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.440
Seems pretty clear it was an accident.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.600
Maybe it will teach you all to have a bit more respect

05:42.640 --> 05:44.360
for the explosives you have on site.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.320
<i>-It's Camille.</i>

06:42.280 --> 06:44.320
<i>Are you busy?</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:47.080


06:47.120 --> 06:48.840
Since you ask, I am finally

06:48.880 --> 06:51.320
addressing some of my audiovisual issues.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.200
-<i> Okay. Only, there's</i> <i>been a murder.</i>

06:54.240 --> 06:57.160
<i>Up in the hills</i>

06:57.200 --> 06:59.000
I'll be there as soon as I can.

07:15.680 --> 07:16.840
Merci.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.720
-Merci. -This way.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.440
Ah.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.560
RICHARD: Ugh!

08:08.800 --> 08:10.280
Who's this?

08:10.320 --> 08:13.240
Dr Ian Parks. He was the team's geologist.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.480
His body was found here just after 9 am this morning

08:15.520 --> 08:18.880
by his colleague Daniel Morgan,

08:15.520 --> 08:18.880
this is Daniel's tent.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.600
A single gunshot to the chest, entered between third

08:18.920 --> 08:22.600
and fourth rib,

08:22.640 --> 08:24.600
no exit wound that we can see.

08:24.640 --> 08:29.920
No witnesses, no-one heard a gunshot, and he was last seen

08:24.640 --> 08:29.920
around 11.30 last night.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.840
What's this?

08:31.880 --> 08:34.640
It's a single-barrelled flintlock pistol.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.080
It was being restored by Dr Parks,

08:36.120 --> 08:38.320
so we think he was cleaning it when it discharged.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.200
You're saying it was an accident?

08:40.240 --> 08:42.240
Well, it's the only thing that makes sense.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.160
Someone's been, er, burning some paper in here.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.720
-Preserve it without disturbing it if you can.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.720
-Yes, sir.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.960
How do we know that he was restoring the pistol?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.600
-Dwayne spoke to Mr Morgan about it yesterday, sir.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.080
The explosion Dwayne and Fidel attended.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.640
-Yes, sir.

08:59.680 --> 09:02.720
One caught in an explosion, the other one shot dead.

09:02.760 --> 09:05.040
I hope they haven't wasted any money on the lottery.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.320
So, er...

09:08.360 --> 09:10.760
...these are actual treasure-hunters,

09:08.360 --> 09:10.760
is that right?

09:10.800 --> 09:15.200
Well, sir, I'm afraid they are.

09:15.240 --> 09:19.000
Do you believe they have a little bit too much time

09:15.240 --> 09:19.000
on their hands?

09:19.040 --> 09:23.200
So, if this wasn't Dr Parks' tent, what was he doing in here?

09:23.240 --> 09:26.080
We've asked everyone that same question. No-one knows.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.040
-Sure.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.040
I don't think it was an accident.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.200
-First, he was a clever man.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.880
Only an idiot would clean a loaded pistol.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.800
And secondly, if he was that stupid,

09:39.840 --> 09:43.320
why isn't the cloth he was using to clean the gun

09:43.360 --> 09:46.240
either on the floor beside him or in his hand?

09:46.280 --> 09:48.600
I agree. And, if he accidentally

09:48.640 --> 09:51.600
shot himself while cleaning the pistol,

09:51.640 --> 09:54.800
why is there a bullet hole...

09:54.840 --> 09:55.840
...in the tent?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.680
What was he even doing in there anyway?

10:01.960 --> 10:04.400
How the hell do I know

10:04.440 --> 10:06.520
You two have been up to something for weeks.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.400
I didn't realise we were under surveillance.

10:08.440 --> 10:11.480
Liz has got a point, Dan. I've noticed it, too.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.360
Maybe...you found something.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.640
Like what?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.760
-You tell us. -Ahem.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.400
I'm, er, sorry for the death of your friend.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.040
I wonder if you'd mind answering just a few questions.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.200
-Not yet, miss,

10:25.240 --> 10:27.800
but rest assured, we'll be leaving no stone unturned.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.880
Er, yes, er...

10:34.920 --> 10:38.600
Right, Mr Morgan, I understand it was you that

10:34.920 --> 10:38.600
found Dr Parks this morning.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.280
That's right. I broke my wrist yesterday in the explosion,

10:42.320 --> 10:45.120
and didn't fancy sleeping in a camp bed last night,

10:42.320 --> 10:45.120
so I got Benjamin

10:45.160 --> 10:46.920
to drive me to the Bay Cove Hotel.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.360
Who's Benjamin?

10:49.640 --> 10:52.000
Benjamin Sammy. He lives down the mountain.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.480
He helps out whenever we need a spare pair of hands.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.520
Why not use your own breast? Er...

10:58.560 --> 10:59.600
...vehicle?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.120
The air con packed up. Benjamin was fixing it.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.680
Carry on.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.680
We left the camp about 11pm,

11:09.720 --> 11:12.120
drove to the hotel, and Benjamin picked me up

11:09.720 --> 11:12.120
this morning.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.320
<i>That's when I found him.</i>

11:17.360 --> 11:18.800
<i>In my tent.</i>

11:20.280 --> 11:22.560
And you?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.440
<i>Er, we, the three of us,</i> <i>stayed up for a tipple...</i>

11:25.480 --> 11:28.160
<i>Well, Chris and I did,</i> <i>Ian was teetotal.</i>

11:36.880 --> 11:39.200
<i>Actually, it turned</i> <i>into a bit of a session.</i>

11:39.240 --> 11:42.040
Sorry...Are you saying that's why you didn't hear the gunshot

11:42.080 --> 11:43.640
because you were intoxicated?

11:43.680 --> 11:46.440
<i>Well, I can't speak for Chris,</i> <i>but I was out for the count.</i>

11:46.480 --> 11:49.160
RICHARD:<i> Can't even remember</i> <i>getting to bed?</i>

11:49.200 --> 11:52.000
Do either of you know why Dr Parks wasn't in his

11:49.200 --> 11:52.000
own tent?

11:55.440 --> 11:56.520
No. Hmm.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.920
This...

12:01.840 --> 12:03.040
...map...

12:05.720 --> 12:07.040
This is what brought you here?

12:08.040 --> 12:09.320
Yeah.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.560
It was found on Pigeon Island, just off St Lucia,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.320
an old pirate stronghold.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.120
The idea was that whoever buried it

12:15.160 --> 12:17.600
would remember the exact spot when they

12:15.160 --> 12:17.600
came back to collect it.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.920
And if they never came back?

12:19.960 --> 12:21.680
Then the treasure stayed buried.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.400
It's pretty much where we come in.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.160
It's a big area, but we analyse soil

12:23.440 --> 12:27.160
and rock samples,

12:27.200 --> 12:29.520
that's where Ian came into his own.

12:31.600 --> 12:35.640
Gold's inert, but not all treasure is going to be

12:31.600 --> 12:35.640
exclusively gold,

12:35.680 --> 12:37.640
and by testing the samples he could find traces

12:37.680 --> 12:40.480
of other metals such as bronze and copper.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.960
But you didn't find the treasure?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.800
Nope.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.440
We thought it could be in the caves under this land.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.680
But now we'll never know.

12:51.720 --> 12:55.280
Not after the explosion yesterday in the entrance

12:51.720 --> 12:55.280
to the inner caves.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.120
It's completely sealed off.

12:59.600 --> 13:03.080
I see. Well, er, someone will come and take your statement

12:59.600 --> 13:03.080
in full,

13:03.120 --> 13:06.480
but, er, for now,

13:06.520 --> 13:07.880
thank you for your time.

13:10.560 --> 13:15.280
Oh, er, yes, I'm afraid we will have to ask you not to

13:10.560 --> 13:15.280
leave the island.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.840
Why?

13:17.880 --> 13:19.960
We may need to talk to you again.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.800
-No.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.040
I'm saying we'd appreciate it if you didn't make any plans

13:22.840 --> 13:26.040
to leave the island.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.240
Now, do these people need permission to be up here?

13:33.280 --> 13:38.400
Yes, Chief. The landowner is Joel Maurice, the house

13:33.280 --> 13:38.400
we passed on the way up.

13:38.440 --> 13:41.240
Good, well divide and conquer. You check the site for evidence.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.080
Camille and I will start there.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.880
Her.

13:47.920 --> 13:51.040
-I just know.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.240
Well let's arrest her right now. What do you suggest we...

13:53.280 --> 13:56.960
-I'm not protecting her!

13:57.000 --> 14:00.280
Just because she's attractive, doesn't mean she's telling

13:57.000 --> 14:00.280
the truth.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.480
Is she attractive? I...

14:01.520 --> 14:03.640
Oh! You were ogling her like a schoolboy.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.960
-I wasn't ogling. -Yeah, you were.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.720
-I don't ogle. -You were!

14:06.760 --> 14:09.560
That's ridiculous, I was just asking some

14:06.760 --> 14:09.560
straightforward questions.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.040
CAMILLE: Come on. Shut up!

14:36.440 --> 14:38.080
Sorry.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.200
Yeah, sure.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.520
So what did your inspector say?

14:49.560 --> 14:51.400
Does he think it was an accident?

14:51.440 --> 14:54.080
Oh, I'm sorry, miss, but I really...

14:54.120 --> 14:58.280
-Oh, sorry, I shouldn't really be asking.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.280
-Yeah, no, it's okay.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.120
Ian was cleaning the pistol though when it went off?

15:01.160 --> 15:04.640
I'm really sorry, miss, but I can't talk about it.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.360
Of course you can't.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.920
But...

15:08.960 --> 15:12.800
...if it did turn out not to be an accident,

15:08.960 --> 15:12.800
I'm probably a suspect?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.240
No.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.640
So I'm not?

15:17.080 --> 15:18.120
No.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.280
Yes.

15:19.320 --> 15:20.880
No. I don't know.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.480
I mean I'm not sure we even have any yet,

15:20.920 --> 15:24.480
so, you know.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.520
It's Fidel, isn't it?

15:30.560 --> 15:32.840
Er, me? Yes.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.000
Is there a Mrs Fidel?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.800
No.

15:37.840 --> 15:39.680
Yes, there is, of course!

15:41.960 --> 15:45.080
-We've got a baby. -Oh.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.480
Anyway, erm, you know, it was really good talking to you,

15:47.520 --> 15:51.120
but I must, I must go, you know. Work to do.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.920
-I hope I didn't hold you up. -No, no, no.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.440
You take care.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.880
Bye.

16:10.200 --> 16:14.400
Maybe they have found the gold and they're fighting

16:10.200 --> 16:14.400
amongst themselves.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.400
We've no proof they've found anything.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.360
Agreed, but if they have found it,

16:18.400 --> 16:22.560
it gives us three very clear suspects,

16:18.400 --> 16:22.560
the other members of the group.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.760
Someone else, not in the group, also discovered they'd found

16:26.800 --> 16:30.520
Le Clerc's gold and wants them dead, so they can steal

16:26.800 --> 16:30.520
it for themselves.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.800
What do you want?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.240
Detective Inspector Richard Poole,

16:36.280 --> 16:38.840
this is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.520
Of course I knew what they were after.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.040
So you visited the camp?

16:46.640 --> 16:50.840
Now and again, just to see what they were up to.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.920
Up to?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.760
Making sure that if they found anything,

16:55.800 --> 16:57.640
they wouldn't forget to tell me.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.360
I get half. That was the deal.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
I see.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.600
Can I ask where you were last night?

17:06.640 --> 17:07.680
I was here.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.560
Alone?

17:11.200 --> 17:12.520
No.

17:12.560 --> 17:14.600
I telephoned Beyonce,

17:14.640 --> 17:18.560
she came over and we had a wild night of hot,

17:14.640 --> 17:18.560
passionate sex.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.360
I see, and this Beyonce can vouch for that, can she?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.920
I can't believe you don't know who Beyonce is!

17:30.960 --> 17:34.040
Why people can't just give a simple answer

17:30.960 --> 17:34.040
to a simple question,

17:34.600 --> 17:35.960
I'll never know.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.240
Looks like he could use some money.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.480
Stealing the treasure for himself could be

17:39.280 --> 17:42.480
quite a motive.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.120
That only works if we know for sure

17:42.520 --> 17:45.120
they've found something.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
And we don't.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.320
A man shot by an antique flintlock pistol

18:25.920 --> 18:29.320
is strange enough,

18:29.360 --> 18:31.480
but the victim being found in the tent of a man

18:31.520 --> 18:34.240
almost killed in an explosion on the same day?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.360
So you think the killer failed to kill Daniel Morgan

18:37.400 --> 18:42.240
in the explosion and came back later that night

18:37.400 --> 18:42.240
to finish the job?

18:42.280 --> 18:44.880
Which means Dr Parks was killed simply for being

18:44.920 --> 18:47.560
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.160
Which of this lot is our killer?

18:50.200 --> 18:54.560
Well, not Daniel, if he was the intended victim.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.080
-We, er, we found some debris from the cave, sir.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.080
-Excellent.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.000
It looks like part of a detonator.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.440
Check it for prints along with the pistol, would you.

19:03.480 --> 19:07.160
-No there's nothing from the

19:03.480 --> 19:07.160
camp or the surrounding areas.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.240
Oh!

19:09.280 --> 19:12.440
-Good afternoon, team. -ALL: Sir.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.160
You're investigating the mystery of Francois

19:12.480 --> 19:16.160
Le Clerc's missing gold?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.680
RICHARD: Not exactly, sir.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.400
We have a death that may or may not

19:17.720 --> 19:21.400
be related in some way.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.920
An explosion and a shooting?

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
Yes, that's right.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.960
Accidental?

19:28.000 --> 19:32.080
Well, it's a little too early to say for certain, but early

19:28.000 --> 19:32.080
indications would suggest not.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.160
You do know about the curse?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.400
Yes.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.520
Although for the time being I have decided to eliminate

19:47.560 --> 19:50.680
all 400-year-old pirates from our enquiries.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.880
I'm very pleased to hear it.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.560
So, have we made any progress?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.960
Well we were just reviewing the evidence when you came in.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.880
Is there some problem, sir, or...

20:01.400 --> 20:04.480
The legend of Francois Le Clerc brings a lot of tourists

20:04.520 --> 20:06.240
to the island, inspector.

20:06.280 --> 20:10.120
I'd appreciate you not doing anything to jeopardise that.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.320
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

20:12.360 --> 20:17.000
If it's a murder, then of course you must bring

20:12.360 --> 20:17.000
the killer to justice.

20:17.040 --> 20:22.800
Just don't do anything silly like proving Le Clerc

20:17.040 --> 20:22.800
and his gold don't exist.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.360
Or that he never came to Sainte-Marie after all.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.680
Don't rock the pirate ship, sir.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.640
That's exactly what I mean.

20:31.680 --> 20:35.560
I'm simply asking that you be aware of the bigger picture.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.120
The bigger picture, absolutely. We'll do our very best, sir.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.400
Thank you.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.800
Now, erm, don't let me hold you up.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.240
-Carry on. -ALL: Sir.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.720
Mark the commissioner down as a suspect, would you?

20:51.760 --> 20:54.200
Bumping off people to boost local tourism.

20:54.240 --> 20:57.280
Meanwhile, we must be thorough.

20:57.320 --> 21:02.400
We can't assume that Dr Parks' death had anything to do

20:57.320 --> 21:02.400
with this imagined treasure.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.400
So, Dwayne, you'd better run background checks on everyone.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.080
DWAYNE: Yes, chief.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.120
RICHARD: Focus your efforts on Daniel Morgan first.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.120
Who is he?

21:09.160 --> 21:10.600
Why would someone want him dead?

21:22.960 --> 21:23.960
Hello?

21:26.880 --> 21:27.920
Liz?

21:31.240 --> 21:32.320
Chris?

21:40.080 --> 21:41.160
Agh!

21:54.240 --> 21:55.600
What happened?

22:04.560 --> 22:06.440
Drive me down, Benjamin, will you?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.600
Daniel?

22:08.280 --> 22:10.240
Where are you going?

22:10.280 --> 22:13.520
Pathologist report's through and there are no surprises.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.600
It's a single shot to the right kidney, stomach and intestines.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.960
Either shock or internal bleeding caused his death.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.200
Ballistics have matched the shot to the pistol.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.800
Also the wound showed fibres that matched

22:21.240 --> 22:23.800
the victim's clothing

22:23.840 --> 22:25.960
and what seems to be strands of a cleaning cloth

22:26.000 --> 22:28.800
with traces of a lubricant, polyalkylene glycol.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.520
Right. That must have been used to oil the gun.

22:31.560 --> 22:34.320
Right. And we're waiting on fingerprints from the pistol

22:34.360 --> 22:37.760
-and the debris from explosive material found in the cave.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.800
Dr Ian Parks is attached to Cambridge university.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.360
Not so much as a parking ticket and nothing so far

22:43.400 --> 22:45.800
to suggest why anyone would wish him any harm.

22:45.840 --> 22:49.640
Elizabeth Curtis and Chris Winchester

22:45.840 --> 22:49.640
seem clean enough too.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.640
Both from wealthy families, both travel extensively,

22:52.680 --> 22:54.240
nothing on the police computer.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.680
Daniel Morgan?

22:55.720 --> 22:58.560
A few minor convictions for theft,

22:58.600 --> 23:00.960
two of those for religious artefacts.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.240
There's also a note on his police file.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.200
Just before leaving the UK to come here,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.720
he was being investigated by an insurance firm.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.720
-It seems he was hired to

23:07.760 --> 23:11.720
reclaim gold bullion from a ship

23:11.760 --> 23:14.080
that sank off the coast of France.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.680
By the time Daniel and his crew got down to the wreck,

23:16.720 --> 23:18.520
they claimed they couldn't find the gold anywhere.

23:18.560 --> 23:21.600
The insurance company think he got to it first?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.400
That's what they suspect.

23:23.440 --> 23:24.960
But then, they would.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.160
They lost millions on the insurance.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.680
And here we are again talking about missing gold.

23:30.720 --> 23:35.240
Yet that still doesn't mean they found the treasure,

23:30.720 --> 23:35.240
does it?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.640
Okay, I admit, it looks like he was a crook in the past

23:37.680 --> 23:40.360
maybe he even stole the gold from that sunken boat.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.000
That doesn't mean that's what this case is about.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.520
I know what you're doing.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.120
Who haven't we spoken to yet?

23:59.160 --> 24:01.760
The Bay Cove Hotel duty manager and Benjamin Sammy.

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
Good.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.520
When you were in the camp, er, did you see any arguments?

24:10.560 --> 24:13.240
Erm, any hostility between them?

24:13.280 --> 24:16.440
No, not really. Well, not until today.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.120
Uh

24:18.160 --> 24:21.360
Apparently this big branch nearly fell on him.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.280
-I guess so.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.520
-After it happened, he just wanted to get out of there.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.400
Lunch time!

24:33.680 --> 24:36.160
Aw, he's so sweet!

24:36.200 --> 24:39.000
-No, haven't got round

24:36.200 --> 24:39.000
to it yet.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.920
Oh, what about Richard?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.560
Thank you, Camille. So, how did they contact you?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.800
I think Joel gave them my number.

24:45.840 --> 24:49.120
We get about half a dozen wannabe treasure hunters

24:45.840 --> 24:49.120
out here every year,

24:49.160 --> 24:50.280
not that I'm complaining.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.240
It keeps this little lot in food.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.480
The usual story is they thrash about the rainforest

24:54.520 --> 24:57.680
for a few weeks looking for pirate treasure and then

24:54.520 --> 24:57.680
they go home.

24:57.720 --> 24:58.920
Quite funny, really.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.600
And what do you do for them exactly?

25:00.640 --> 25:05.920
Erm, driving, finding supplies, food. Whatever they need.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.640
Er, Daniel said you took him to the Bay Cove Hotel

25:05.960 --> 25:09.640
last night.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.400
Yeah, that's right. About eleven.

25:11.440 --> 25:15.040
He said his arm was playing up and he'd kill

25:11.440 --> 25:15.040
for a soft, clean bed.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.800
Maybe not literally.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.880
Hm! But you can't be sure he stayed there all night?

25:19.920 --> 25:22.200
No, but he was there when I went back in the morning.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.960
What about you?

25:24.000 --> 25:26.760
After you dropped him off last night, did you come

25:24.000 --> 25:26.760
straight home?

25:26.800 --> 25:29.440
No. I drove to the animal sanctuary in Honore.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.720
You know it?

25:30.760 --> 25:32.640
Picked this little fella up.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.280
They didn't think he'd make it through the night.

25:34.320 --> 25:38.400
So I was here, nursing him with milk

25:34.320 --> 25:38.400
every hour on the hour.

25:38.440 --> 25:41.400
Are you saying you want to use a goat as your alibi?

25:43.840 --> 25:45.360
Feeding Richard.

26:05.400 --> 26:08.080
Ah, sir, we've got a visitor.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.200
Someone tried to drop a tree on me.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.640
-So we hear. -It was cut at one end.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.280
It looked like it had been held up with a vine until

26:14.680 --> 26:18.280
I was underneath it.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.920
Damn near killed me! Then I got to thinking.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.640
The explosion in the cave, Ian getting shot

26:21.600 --> 26:24.640
in my bloody tent.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.360
Whoever it is, they're after me, aren't they?

26:28.400 --> 26:30.680
Why do you think anyone would want to kill you?

26:30.720 --> 26:32.160
I don't know,

26:32.200 --> 26:34.080
but you've got my passport and I can't leave the island,

26:34.120 --> 26:38.560
so until you catch them, I demand police protection.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.960
What have I missed?

26:49.360 --> 26:53.840
Fidel, did you preserve the waste paper basket

26:49.360 --> 26:53.840
and burnt paper?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.600
Yes, sir.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.080
Then I'm going to need you to get these items for me,

26:55.640 --> 26:59.080
if you would.

26:59.120 --> 27:02.240
Most of it you should be able to get from a decent

26:59.120 --> 27:02.240
photography shop.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.480
The rest...

27:04.520 --> 27:07.200
...clothes line and pegs,

27:07.240 --> 27:09.280
red light bulb.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.000
Well, I'll leave that to you.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.600
My house...in one hour.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.520
I passed the animal rescue centre on the way here

27:26.560 --> 27:29.520
and they confirmed that Benjamin Sammy

27:26.560 --> 27:29.520
was there last night.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.120
Right.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.440
I also checked with the hotel duty manager.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.760
No-one at the hotel saw Daniel Morgan again

27:39.800 --> 27:42.400
between him checking in and checking out

27:39.800 --> 27:42.400
the next morning.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.360
Good work, Camille.

28:01.920 --> 28:04.200
MAN ON RADIO: <i>The last three overs,</i>

28:01.920 --> 28:04.200
<i>two wickets in hand.</i>

28:04.240 --> 28:05.960
<i>Have they done enough</i> <i>to win this...</i>

28:07.920 --> 28:09.800
Right, let's bring this back from the dead.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.960
If you could just pass me those tweezers?

28:13.520 --> 28:17.200
No, sorry, of course you can't. You don't have opposable thumbs.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.720
That would be mad.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.280
Like running a forensics lab in your kitchen.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.720
Or talking to a lizard.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.080
RICHARD: Camille?

30:19.080 --> 30:20.640
Typical of her. No sticking power.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.440
Uh, has it worked, sir?

30:25.040 --> 30:28.880
Le Clerc's Treasure! PD46! Whoa, they found the treasure!

30:28.920 --> 30:31.400
What's that?

30:31.440 --> 30:34.920
Well, if I was a betting man, I'd say it looked like some

30:31.440 --> 30:34.920
sort of map reference.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.080
Find out where PD46 is, find the treasure.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.440
So...it was about the gold after all.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.720
Yes, quite possibly.

30:53.760 --> 30:56.520
Now we have evidence, it does appear to be about the, um...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.440
Gold. How was our visitor in the cells last night?

31:00.480 --> 31:02.240
-Didn't get a peep out of him. -Mm.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.320
Oh, you know what?

31:06.360 --> 31:09.320
I've got all the treasure hunters' handwritten statements.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.880
-We can find out who wrote this note.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.880
-Good idea.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.040
Has Fidel heard anything from the lab yet?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.240
Actually, where is Fidel?

31:15.280 --> 31:18.200
Yes, we've got the finger prints analysis back.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.360
-All right. -Um...

31:20.400 --> 31:22.720
No finger prints on the pistol, it was wiped clean.

31:22.760 --> 31:26.360
But there were three prints from the detonator we found.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.680
All belong to Daniel Morgan.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.200
Why would he set explosives to blow himself up?

31:31.240 --> 31:33.640
Okay, I know who wrote the note.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.120
Dr Ian Parks.

31:35.160 --> 31:38.440
-His handwriting's

31:35.160 --> 31:38.440
pretty distinctive.

31:38.480 --> 31:41.840
So, if Dr Parks found the treasure, then...

31:41.880 --> 31:44.320
...maybe he was the intended target all along?

31:44.360 --> 31:47.400
In which case, logic suggests the killer might be...

31:48.160 --> 31:49.160
...Daniel Morgan.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.280
First, he sets the explosives to make it look like he's been

31:51.800 --> 31:55.280
caught in a rock fall,

31:55.320 --> 31:58.200
giving him an excuse to check in to the Bay Cove Hotel.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.800
Because if Dr Parks is killed that night...

32:00.840 --> 32:04.080
We're going to think Daniel's the only person

32:00.840 --> 32:04.080
who can't have done it.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.080
Exactly. After Benjamin Sammy drops him off,

32:06.120 --> 32:09.880
he leaves the hotel, goes back up to the clearing,

32:06.120 --> 32:09.880
shoots Dr Parks.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.800
So him coming here to claim that his life was in danger,

32:12.840 --> 32:16.160
-Precisely!

32:16.200 --> 32:18.760
Now all we have to do, is prove it.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.720
Ah, Fidel. There you are.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.240
Yes. What are all these?

32:22.280 --> 32:25.400
Well, when the Chief found the map reference PD46,

32:25.440 --> 32:28.920
I figured I'd try and find out where on the island

32:25.440 --> 32:28.920
it referred to, right?

32:28.960 --> 32:31.600
It couldn't have been on the treasure hunter's

32:28.960 --> 32:31.600
own map, could it?

32:31.640 --> 32:34.840
It doesn't have any grid references. So I went to

32:31.640 --> 32:34.840
Honore Library.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.440
-But, I'm so sorry, sir.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.800
I've been through all these maps, and I mean all of them

32:40.840 --> 32:43.720
and I can't find any kind of symbol,

32:40.840 --> 32:43.720
landmark or reference

32:43.760 --> 32:46.160
called PD, let alone PD46.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.080
-Yes.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.520
You worked all the way through the night?

32:51.560 --> 32:53.840
-I'm getting the coffee. -Uh-uh-uh, no.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.880
I'll get the coffee.

32:55.920 --> 32:57.520
And Don't worry, Fidel.

32:57.560 --> 33:02.520
The fact you couldn't work out where PD46 is shouldn't matter,

33:02.560 --> 33:06.000
because we think we know someone who does.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.760
Really

33:07.800 --> 33:10.560
The murderer. Daniel Morgan.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.600
Fetch him from the cells, would you?

33:12.640 --> 33:15.600
We think Ian Parks found the treasure

33:12.640 --> 33:15.600
and told Daniel Morgan,

33:15.640 --> 33:18.160
who then murdered him so that he could keep it

33:15.640 --> 33:18.160
for himself.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.040
Hoping everyone would think it was an accident.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.960
The pirate's curse. It all fits.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.320
Um, Chief?

33:34.440 --> 33:36.080
The ambulance is on its way.

33:36.120 --> 33:37.120
It's too late.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.160
Looks like an allergic reaction.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.120
Swelling, blue tinge to the skin...

33:44.960 --> 33:48.080
Look, it's an adrenaline pen.

33:48.120 --> 33:51.200
So he should have a dog tag, or a bracelet.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.920
RICHARD: Hmm.

34:00.960 --> 34:04.840
"Medic alert, severe allergy to insect bites."

34:00.960 --> 34:04.840
Anaphylactic shock.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.160
Something has bitten or stung him, he had a reaction,

34:08.200 --> 34:11.800
he used the pen, but it must have been too late,

34:11.840 --> 34:14.160
or too little. Then he died.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.160
Sir.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.840
It's a kissing bug.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.520
It hunts out warm-blooded creatures in the night

34:30.880 --> 34:33.520
and sucks their blood.

34:33.560 --> 34:36.160
You mean these things are just flying around, on the loose?

34:36.200 --> 34:37.720
Don't worry, Chief.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.960
They're no worse than any other things that suck blood at night.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.200
Other things?

34:41.240 --> 34:42.960
But if you've got the right kind of allergy,

34:43.000 --> 34:45.600
the venom from a kissing bug can be fatal.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.720
-You won't like it. -Try me.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.320
The kissing bug is said to be the beetle

34:52.360 --> 34:55.000
that Francois Le Clerc used on his flag.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.520
Right, so, someone clearly wants us to believe

35:00.560 --> 35:04.880
these are deaths brought about by a dead pirate's curse.

35:04.920 --> 35:08.320
Fortunately, we're far too sensible to believe

35:04.920 --> 35:08.320
such a thing.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.800
Common sense tells us that strange as it may seem,

35:11.840 --> 35:15.400
this is about four treasure hunters fighting over

35:11.840 --> 35:15.400
their spoils.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.360
And with two of them dead.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.880
That leaves just two suspects.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.760
Liz Curtis...

35:25.760 --> 35:27.040
...and Chris Winchester.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.480
We believe you found the treasure,

35:32.520 --> 35:35.640
argued amongst yourselves, that argument turned to murder.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.720
There were four, two are dead, that leaves you two

35:37.760 --> 35:40.240
as our prime suspects. Did I miss anything?

35:40.280 --> 35:41.680
I don't think so.

35:41.720 --> 35:44.240
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my entire life.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.000
The only question remaining

35:46.040 --> 35:50.360
is whether one of you worked alone, or if you're

35:46.040 --> 35:50.360
in this together.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.760
Perhaps you're lovers.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.840
No! We're not...

35:54.560 --> 35:56.280
I'm not a killer.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.800
Did anyone else know about Daniel Morgan's allergy

35:56.320 --> 35:59.800
to insect bites?

35:59.840 --> 36:02.120
It wasn't a secret, we all knew about it.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.240
Did you or did you not find the treasure?

36:05.280 --> 36:06.280
No!

36:08.520 --> 36:10.000
Well, we didn't.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.920
What does that mean?

36:11.960 --> 36:14.960
Me and Liz started to notice that Ian and Daniel were

36:11.960 --> 36:14.960
up to something.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.960
They were always huddled together talking,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.320
but they'd clam up whenever we went anywhere near.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.640
So you thought that maybe they'd found something?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.040
Well, yes, it had crossed our minds.

36:24.080 --> 36:28.000
Which would give you a strong motive to kill them both,

36:24.080 --> 36:28.000
wouldn't it?

36:28.040 --> 36:29.680
Have you got a problem with me?

36:29.720 --> 36:32.560
Yes. I don't think you've been telling us the truth.

36:32.600 --> 36:35.320
May I remind you both this isn't a fanciful

36:32.600 --> 36:35.320
pirate story,

36:35.360 --> 36:37.120
it's a murder enquiry.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.880
LIZ: Look, this is stupid.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.400
It doesn't matter anymore, anyway.

36:42.440 --> 36:46.400
I can't speak for anyone else, but I have no interest

36:42.440 --> 36:46.400
in finding the treasure.

36:46.440 --> 36:49.160
All right? The truth is, I never had.

36:49.200 --> 36:52.720
-I didn't come to Sainte-Marie

36:49.200 --> 36:52.720
to hunt for treasure.

36:52.760 --> 36:55.720
I was investigating Daniel Morgan.

36:55.760 --> 36:58.480
-Yes.

36:58.520 --> 37:02.360
Daniel Morgan is responsible for a very substantial claim

36:58.520 --> 37:02.360
last year

37:02.400 --> 37:04.560
and I'm part of the team investigating it.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.080
Call my supervisor on that number.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.400
He'll verify everything.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.360
Thank you.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.560
He confirmed everything.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.560
She was sent here to keep track of Daniel Morgan.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
Which means I was right.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.600
-I told you she was

37:26.640 --> 37:29.600
hiding something.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.680
-Yes, yes, you did. -Say it then.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.160
-That I was right.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.520
-You were right. -Thank you.

37:36.560 --> 37:37.720
-Please.

37:37.760 --> 37:40.080
Okay, so we're being led to believe

37:40.120 --> 37:41.880
there have been a series of accidents.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.680
It started with an explosion,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.160
then someone was supposedly killed while cleaning an

37:43.720 --> 37:46.160
antique pistol,

37:46.200 --> 37:48.000
then a falling tree.

37:48.040 --> 37:51.000
Finally, a man known to have a severe allergy to insect bites

37:51.040 --> 37:54.960
was bitten by a beetle while in a police cell.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.280
All of these events happening between four people

37:57.320 --> 37:59.760
within the space of 48 hours.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.120
The odds against this sequence of events truly

37:59.800 --> 38:03.120
happening accidentally

38:03.160 --> 38:07.400
in that time frame are tens of millions to one.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.240
-Agreed. -So we're left with two

38:07.440 --> 38:10.240
possible explanations.

38:10.280 --> 38:13.360
First, they are indeed the result of a curse left

38:10.280 --> 38:13.360
by a one-legged pirate

38:13.400 --> 38:15.600
400 years ago.

38:15.640 --> 38:18.320
Or second, we have two murders, perpetrated

38:18.360 --> 38:21.920
by a single assailant, or one or more people

38:18.360 --> 38:21.920
working together.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.600
So, who stood to gain the most from the deaths

38:25.640 --> 38:28.160
of Dr Ian Parks and Daniel Morgan?

38:28.200 --> 38:30.880
Well, whoever knew they'd found the treasure.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.040
But that's a dead end, isn't it, Chief?

38:33.080 --> 38:37.000
Seeing as young Fidel here pretty much proved

38:33.080 --> 38:37.000
PD46 isn't on any kind of map.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.760
Wherever the gold is buried, it isn't on Sainte-Marie.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
Wait!

38:41.960 --> 38:43.120
Dwayne, you're right.

38:44.560 --> 38:46.760
That's exactly what Fidel proved.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.000
There was a small plastic container

38:50.040 --> 38:52.680
full of soil and rock samples, it's not here.

38:52.720 --> 38:55.520
It wasn't there when I got back to the camp site.

38:55.560 --> 38:56.560
Of course it wasn't.

39:00.760 --> 39:02.320
Autopsy report, where is it?

39:06.920 --> 39:09.440
Ha! It wasn't just Dr Parks in the wrong tent,

39:09.480 --> 39:11.120
everything's wrong, it's all upside down.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.320
Dwayne, Fidel, I want you to pick everyone up.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.160
Well, everyone who's still alive anyway.

39:15.200 --> 39:17.840
Liz Curtis, Chris Winchester, Benjamin.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.400
I want everyone at Joel Maurice's house

39:17.880 --> 39:20.400
in an hour.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.800
In the words of our pirate brethren,

39:22.840 --> 39:24.160
"We need to parlay."

39:26.600 --> 39:29.120
Um, is this about the treasure or not?

39:29.160 --> 39:31.120
Yes. And no.

39:33.040 --> 39:34.040
Come on.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.560
JOEL: Can you tell me what's going on?

39:39.600 --> 39:41.840
I mean, why does everyone have to be here?

39:41.880 --> 39:44.160
Because this is where it all began.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.200
The land you own holds the secret that unlocks

39:44.200 --> 39:47.200
this mystery.

39:50.920 --> 39:54.080
I must say, this has been a tricky case from the start.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.400
Firstly, because of the treasure.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.480
How could the murder not be about it?

39:58.520 --> 40:01.880
And secondly, because to begin with

40:01.920 --> 40:04.680
we could never really be sure who the intended victim was.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.760
Was it Daniel

40:07.800 --> 40:10.080
Or was Dr Parks the target all along?

40:11.840 --> 40:13.040
Then it struck me.

40:14.280 --> 40:15.720
What if it was both?

40:17.080 --> 40:18.840
Chris.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.840
You said that Daniel and Ian were often huddled

40:18.880 --> 40:21.840
together, conspiring.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.440
Yes.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.000
CAMILLE:<i> So let's imagine,</i> <i>what if they discovered</i>

40:24.480 --> 40:27.000
<i>the treasure...</i>

40:27.040 --> 40:30.040
RICHARD:<i> And rather than share</i> <i>their findings with the rest</i>

40:27.040 --> 40:30.040
<i>of the group,</i>

40:30.080 --> 40:31.720
they decided to keep it for themselves?

40:31.760 --> 40:32.800
I knew it.

40:35.640 --> 40:39.520
We found part of a detonator at the scene of the explosion,

40:39.560 --> 40:42.320
covered in Daniel Morgan's fingerprints.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.840
But why would Daniel want to blow himself up?

40:45.880 --> 40:50.120
The key was to separate the facts and look at them

40:45.880 --> 40:50.120
not together,

40:50.160 --> 40:51.760
but individually.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.320
First, why would Daniel want to set the explosives?

40:54.360 --> 40:57.280
Well, seeing as they started a rock fall

40:57.320 --> 40:59.560
which then partially sealed the cave,

40:59.600 --> 41:01.240
maybe that's all he was trying to do.

41:01.280 --> 41:05.040
So that's it! That's where the gold is, in the cave!

41:05.080 --> 41:09.160
Will you please sit down and no, the gold isn't in the cave.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.920
CAMILLE: But the fact that he was caught up

41:09.200 --> 41:11.920
in the blast suggests

41:11.960 --> 41:15.080
someone else set it off, before Daniel could get clear.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.240
I hope you're not going to suggest it was me.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.320
The moment we confirmed your story...

41:22.160 --> 41:23.680
Yes, you're right.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.240
It was unlikely you could be our killer.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.120
Which meant we were down to only two suspects.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.640
But without any prompting from us,

41:32.680 --> 41:36.680
you told us about Daniel Morgan and Dr Parks'

41:32.680 --> 41:36.680
secretive behaviour.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.800
Why would the killer draw our attention to that?

41:39.840 --> 41:41.840
So we're left with someone in financial trouble

41:41.880 --> 41:44.560
who readily admitted he already suspected the victims

41:44.600 --> 41:47.120
of trying to cheat him out of what was rightfully his.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.960
Unless...

41:50.520 --> 41:52.600
This isn't about the treasure at all.

41:52.640 --> 41:54.360
As unlikely as that seems.

41:54.400 --> 41:56.480
Because once you remove the tantalising appeal

41:56.520 --> 42:00.520
of missing gold from the equation, then there could

41:56.520 --> 42:00.520
be other motives.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.440
Indeed, there could be a motive where in terms

42:00.560 --> 42:03.440
of cold hard cash,

42:03.480 --> 42:06.480
the killer gains absolutely nothing. Does he, Benjamin?

42:06.520 --> 42:08.160
What?

42:08.200 --> 42:09.600
RICHARD: It was you, wasn't it?

42:11.640 --> 42:13.720
First, you attempted to murder Daniel Morgan

42:13.760 --> 42:16.960
by setting off the explosives but failed.

42:17.000 --> 42:21.080
You had no such trouble with Dr Parks who you

42:17.000 --> 42:21.080
shot in cold blood,

42:21.120 --> 42:22.880
before finishing the job you set out to do,

42:22.920 --> 42:24.960
by murdering Daniel Morgan in a police cell.

42:27.280 --> 42:30.160
And um, and empty out his pockets, would you?

42:30.200 --> 42:32.680
You see, Benjamin of all the people in the camp

42:32.720 --> 42:37.280
was most likely to get wind of what Daniel

42:32.720 --> 42:37.280
and Ian were up to.

42:37.320 --> 42:40.200
<i>Once you knew their secret,</i> <i>you watched them.</i>

42:40.240 --> 42:43.920
And seeing Daniel set the explosives was too good

42:40.240 --> 42:43.920
anopportunity to miss.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.440
RICHARD: Although Daniel survived,

43:02.480 --> 43:05.360
the fact you knew he was spending the night

43:02.480 --> 43:05.360
in the Bay Cove Hotel

43:05.400 --> 43:08.320
gave you the opportunity to come back for Dr Parks.

43:08.360 --> 43:11.600
We checked. You left the animal sanctuary

43:08.360 --> 43:11.600
shortly after midnight.

43:11.640 --> 43:14.080
BENJAMIN:<i> I was feeding</i> <i>the goat through the night.</i>

43:14.120 --> 43:15.480
<i>It would've died otherwise.</i>

43:15.520 --> 43:17.400
RICHARD:<i> Which is the most</i> <i>puzzling thing of all.</i>

43:17.440 --> 43:20.320
<i>A killer who understands</i> <i>the sanctity of life.</i>

43:20.360 --> 43:21.960
<i>If you missed one feed</i> <i>with your goat,</i>

43:22.000 --> 43:24.400
<i>it was a risk worth taking,</i> <i>wasn't it?</i>

43:24.440 --> 43:28.440
<i>You were often in the camp,</i> <i>so had ample opportunity</i>

43:24.440 --> 43:28.440
<i>to steal the pistol.</i>

43:28.480 --> 43:30.200
This time there was no mistake.

43:35.640 --> 43:38.000
Knowing that Dr Parks was trying to restore

43:35.640 --> 43:38.000
the pistol,

43:38.040 --> 43:40.280
by leaving it behind with a cloth,

43:40.320 --> 43:43.000
you hoped it would appear there'd been a terrible accident

43:43.040 --> 43:44.480
while the gun was being cleaned.

43:44.520 --> 43:48.640
But you made one very simple mistake. Camille?

43:48.680 --> 43:52.520
You cleaned the gun yourself, didn't you

43:52.560 --> 43:54.960
We found traces of the oil you used,

43:55.000 --> 43:58.800
both on this cloth and on the shot.

43:58.840 --> 44:02.320
It didn't register at first. Why would it?

44:02.360 --> 44:05.440
But, er, the oil we found wasn't gun oil, was it?

44:05.480 --> 44:09.200
You used something else, didn't you? Polyalkylene glycol.

44:09.240 --> 44:10.920
Most notably used for?

44:10.960 --> 44:13.000
Air conditioning systems in cars, sir.

44:13.040 --> 44:14.440
And we already know you were fixing

44:14.480 --> 44:17.360
the air conditioning unit in the Land Rover.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.840
First you attempted to murder Daniel Morgan and failed.

44:19.880 --> 44:24.400
You then shot Dr Parks dead, but now, what to do with Daniel.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.680
RICHARD:<i> The little episode</i> <i>with the falling branch</i>

44:26.720 --> 44:29.880
<i>was opportunistic</i> <i>and never likely to succeed.</i>

44:31.800 --> 44:35.240
It provided you with one more opportunity when

44:31.800 --> 44:35.240
suspecting his colleagues,

44:35.280 --> 44:39.000
Daniel asked you to drive him in to town.

44:39.040 --> 44:43.320
<i>First you had to make sure</i> t<i> hat Daniel's emergency</i>

44:39.040 --> 44:43.320
<i>adrenaline pen was empty.</i>

44:43.360 --> 44:45.680
<i>He'd only been on the island</i> <i>a few weeks.</i>

44:45.720 --> 44:47.680
<i>Most of the time</i> <i>he'd been in the rain forest,</i>

44:47.720 --> 44:49.680
<i>so only the three people</i> <i>he came with</i>

44:49.720 --> 44:52.720
<i>and you would've known about</i> <i>his allergy to insect bites.</i>

44:52.760 --> 44:54.440
<i>Your plan was</i> <i>surprisingly simple.</i>

44:54.480 --> 44:57.160
<i>You had no way of knowing where</i> <i>Daniel would spend that night,</i>

44:57.200 --> 44:59.120
<i>so you just made sure that</i> <i>wherever he was,</i>

44:59.160 --> 45:01.920
<i>as soon as he sat down</i> <i>for his evening smoke,</i>

45:01.960 --> 45:04.000
<i>he'd release the bug...</i>

45:04.040 --> 45:06.680
<i>and with it,</i> <i>bring about his own death.</i>

45:24.960 --> 45:26.880
<i>Potentially brilliant.</i>

45:26.920 --> 45:30.080
<i>After all, it was indeed</i> <i>the kissing bug...</i>

45:30.120 --> 45:33.480
<i>...that killed Daniel Morgan.</i>

45:33.520 --> 45:36.160
<i>But, er, this cleverest</i> <i>of murders...</i>

45:36.200 --> 45:37.880
...will now prove your guilt.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.680
There it is.

45:44.720 --> 45:47.280
RICHARD:<i> Because you</i> <i>had to steal Daniel's</i>

45:44.720 --> 45:47.280
<i>lighter, didn't you?</i>

45:47.320 --> 45:48.760
<i>It was the only way</i> <i>you could be sure</i>

45:48.800 --> 45:51.880
<i>he would open the match box</i> <i>and release the bug.</i>

45:51.920 --> 45:53.640
And the beetle was perfect,

45:53.680 --> 45:55.760
wasn't it? Because all along you've wanted people to think

45:55.800 --> 45:59.040
this was all about Le Clerc's treasure, haven't you?

45:59.080 --> 46:02.160
But it's got nothing to do with it, has it, Benjamin?

46:02.200 --> 46:07.360
Because despite Daniel and Dr Parks' conspiring,

46:07.400 --> 46:09.960
Francois Le Clerc's treasure was never found.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.080
But I thought... -Shut up!

46:14.320 --> 46:16.320
CHRIS: Okay, look, I don't get it.

46:16.360 --> 46:19.160
If Ian and Dan didn't find the treasure,

46:16.360 --> 46:19.160
why did he kill them?

46:19.200 --> 46:22.760
Oh, Benjamin has a motive, it's just nothing to do

46:19.200 --> 46:22.760
with Le Clerc's treasure, is it?

46:24.200 --> 46:25.960
I believe we have enough physical evidence

46:26.000 --> 46:28.360
to convict you of the murder of Dr Parks, but we both know

46:28.400 --> 46:30.760
you're also responsible for the death

46:28.400 --> 46:30.760
of Daniel Morgan.

46:30.800 --> 46:33.920
So, um, I'll give you a choice.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.560
Either you confess to both murders,

46:35.600 --> 46:37.360
or in setting out my case against you,

46:37.400 --> 46:39.200
I'll reveal your true motive. Understand?

46:40.440 --> 46:41.720
And if I do confess?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.840
Then the subject's closed.

46:45.760 --> 46:46.760
You swear it?

46:48.040 --> 46:50.000
Yes, you have my word.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.000
And I dare say a confession will make the court more lenient.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.800
All right then, I did it. I killed them both.

46:58.640 --> 47:01.960
I shot Ian and I killed Daniel with the kissing

46:58.640 --> 47:01.960
bug like he said.

47:05.960 --> 47:06.960
Thank you.

47:08.680 --> 47:11.680
Dwayne, Fidel,

47:11.720 --> 47:15.160
read him his rights, get him to the station

47:11.720 --> 47:15.160
and take his confession.

47:15.200 --> 47:16.280
Yes, sir.

47:17.960 --> 47:21.280
What about Le Clerc's bloody treasure?

47:21.320 --> 47:23.280
Well, it's been hidden for the last 400 years.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.600
Doesn't that rather imply that it's still out there?

47:34.640 --> 47:36.240
-Somewhere... -Mm-hm.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.240
-Mm-hm.

47:45.080 --> 47:48.040
Well, Benjamin's confessed to both murders.

47:48.080 --> 47:50.120
He says they treated him badly and he snapped.

47:50.160 --> 47:52.040
He confessed, but I don't believe it.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.320
Come on, Chief. What was his real motive?

47:58.400 --> 48:01.720
-Sure. -Well, I'd forgotten

47:58.400 --> 48:01.720
something very simple.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.720
Dr Parks was a geologist.

48:04.760 --> 48:09.320
We all got so carried away with the romantic notion

48:04.760 --> 48:09.320
of pirate treasure, haven't we,

48:09.360 --> 48:13.080
that we presumed PD46 had to be a local map reference?

48:13.120 --> 48:16.400
PD is a chemical symbol, 46 is an atomic number.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.920
Together they represent the thing

48:17.960 --> 48:21.080
that Daniel and Ian found in the cave.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.760
-I still don't get it. -Palladium.

48:23.800 --> 48:27.360
It's used in every mobile phone and laptop in the world

48:23.800 --> 48:27.360
and is vanishingly rare.

48:27.400 --> 48:30.800
As such, it's one of the most precious metals on Earth.

48:30.840 --> 48:33.400
I think that's what Daniel and Ian found

48:30.840 --> 48:33.400
in those caves.

48:33.440 --> 48:36.480
-Almost certainly.

48:36.520 --> 48:40.080
And that's why Daniel tried to seal the cave

48:36.520 --> 48:40.080
with an explosion.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.800
Wanted to prevent any further exploration

48:41.840 --> 48:45.360
till they could come back, maybe make Joel an offer

48:41.840 --> 48:45.360
for the land. <i>Benjamin didn't want</i>

48:45.400 --> 48:48.920
<i>anyone else to find out</i> <i>what they'd discovered.</i>

48:48.960 --> 48:52.440
<i>The Palladium would've</i> <i>been extracted using</i>

48:48.960 --> 48:52.440
<i>an open cast mine.</i>

48:52.480 --> 48:55.080
It would have decimated the rain forest.

48:55.120 --> 48:57.080
Benjamin loves that place.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.920
RICHARD:<i> When Benjamin</i> <i>overheard their plan</i>

48:57.120 --> 48:59.920
<i>to seal the cave,</i>

48:59.960 --> 49:04.000
<i>he decided to do</i> <i>the same thing,</i>

48:59.960 --> 49:04.000
<i>but with Daniel in it.</i>

49:04.040 --> 49:06.560
-He murdered Ian Parks

49:04.040 --> 49:06.560
and Daniel Morgan

49:06.600 --> 49:08.920
so that their discovery would die with them.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.680
CAMILLE: His motive wasn't greed.

49:10.720 --> 49:14.040
He killed two men to stop his rain forest

49:10.720 --> 49:14.040
being pulled down.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.120
-But it's still murder. -RICHARD: Of course.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.920
But so long as he goes to prison for it,

49:17.960 --> 49:21.280
I don't see the need to pull down the jungle, as well.

49:17.960 --> 49:21.280
Do you?

49:27.360 --> 49:29.680
Now, anyone fancy a drink?

49:34.640 --> 49:36.200
Try going left a bit.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.240
Left a bit!

49:40.280 --> 49:42.400
<i>Ever wondered what</i> <i>makes our experts tick?</i>

49:42.440 --> 49:46.800
Oh, be still my beating heart. Fiona Bruce! Yes, yes! You...

49:46.840 --> 49:50.320
-Oh. Ah...

49:50.360 --> 49:54.760
-It's just Antiques Roadshow...

49:54.800 --> 49:58.800
Here, in this room, I had Antiques Roadshow.

49:59.840 --> 50:02.120
You're trying to watch English TV?

50:02.160 --> 50:03.400
Is there any other kind?

50:05.840 --> 50:07.440
Let me try.

50:13.400 --> 50:17.000
-Oh, very well, thank you, sir.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.760
Must be an expensive business, taking care of two women.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.920
Yes, it is.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.720
So if it's all right with you

50:23.760 --> 50:26.360
and in light of your excellent work, on both this and every

50:23.760 --> 50:26.360
other case

50:26.400 --> 50:28.240
I've had the privilege to work with you on,

50:28.280 --> 50:31.400
I'd like to put you forward to take your sergeant's exams.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.560
Me

50:36.560 --> 50:38.240
Well, thank you, sir.

50:38.280 --> 50:40.240
You're very welcome.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.480
-CAMILLE: Ready! -Got something.

50:47.400 --> 50:48.680
-Perfect. -Ah.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.720
Camille?

51:00.520 --> 51:02.520
Camille!

51:02.560 --> 51:06.680
What have you done to my TV

51:06.720 --> 51:08.520
You can't stay in there all day.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.320
Okay, I'm sorry.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.880
I said I order you to come and put my television back

51:12.280 --> 51:15.880
as it was.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.680
I suppose you want to ogle that Fiona Bruce too?

51:18.720 --> 51:22.240
-I told you, I do not ogle... -Yes, I've seen you ogling...

51:22.280 --> 51:24.400
You don't even know who Fiona...

51:24.440 --> 51:27.640
-You don't even know... -I can't hear you!

51:24.440 --> 51:27.640
If you want...
