00:03.170 --> 00:04.965
Dear diary, got my

00:04.966 --> 00:06.758
first starring role

00:03.170 --> 00:06.758
on Broadway today!

00:07.425 --> 00:09.176
- Okay, even I don't
- believe that.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.888
- Just wanted to see
- how it looked.

00:13.097 --> 00:15.725
Jessie, I can't sleep.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.352
Oh, want me to

00:17.353 --> 00:18.937
tell you one of my

00:15.767 --> 00:18.937
Army sleepy-time stories?

00:19.270 --> 00:20.334
How about

00:20.335 --> 00:21.397
Good Night, Platoon?

00:23.065 --> 00:24.650
I just want to fall asleep,

00:24.651 --> 00:26.235
not die of boredom.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.029
Milk it is.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.531
And tomorrow night,

00:30.532 --> 00:31.991
we're gonna read from the

00:29.071 --> 00:31.991
Big Book of Manners.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.997
Jessie's diary...

00:38.957 --> 00:39.958
No, I shouldn't

00:39.959 --> 00:40.959
read this...

00:44.712 --> 00:46.171
- (READING)
- "Got a smoothie today,

00:46.213 --> 00:47.424
"and they gave me

00:47.425 --> 00:48.633
what was left in

00:46.213 --> 00:48.633
the blender for free!"

00:49.467 --> 00:50.635
Wow, even her

00:50.636 --> 00:51.803
secrets are boring.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.140
"Found the perfect

00:55.141 --> 00:56.390
thank you gift

00:53.888 --> 00:56.390
for Bertram..."

Here you go.

Sure you don't want to hear

00:59.685 --> 01:03.147
Are You My Major?

01:04.941 --> 01:06.108
No, thanks. I'm good.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.612
How about Cloudy

01:08.613 --> 01:09.821
With a Chance of

01:07.401 --> 01:09.821
Paratroopers?

01:10.112 --> 01:11.781
I'm already asleep!

01:12.907 --> 01:14.554
Well, F-Y-I,

we're all excited about

02:13.509 --> 02:17.638
our new morning webcast,

02:17.680 --> 02:19.181
What Up, Walden?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.102
By everyone, do you mean me?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.270
Because we are the

02:24.271 --> 02:25.396
only people here.

02:26.397 --> 02:27.836
And I wouldn't be,

02:27.837 --> 02:29.274
if I hadn't lost rock,

02:26.397 --> 02:29.274
paper, scissors

02:29.316 --> 02:30.360
to the conversational

02:30.361 --> 02:31.402
Spanish teacher.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.238
Curse you, Senora Feinberg!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.471
Hey, guys. I'm here to

02:38.472 --> 02:40.452
audition for the sportscaster.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.914
Talk to the producer, Ravi.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.707
(EXCITED) I am the producer?

02:45.083 --> 02:46.500
- It was either
- you or that chair.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.088
So I got the job?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.484
That depends.

02:51.485 --> 02:52.631
What qualifications

02:50.337 --> 02:52.631
do you have?

02:52.882 --> 02:54.717
Well, this...

02:55.801 --> 02:57.637
A really cool

02:57.638 --> 02:59.471
sportscaster name,

02:55.801 --> 02:59.471
Diesel Touchdown,

03:00.389 --> 03:03.017
and charisma for days.

03:03.434 --> 03:05.103
The only thing you

03:05.104 --> 03:06.771
have for days is gas

03:03.434 --> 03:06.771
after you eat sauerkraut.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.733
Seriously, what is

03:09.734 --> 03:10.775
going on in there?

03:13.277 --> 03:14.799
Hi, news team!

03:14.800 --> 03:16.321
This just in.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.364
Me!

03:18.741 --> 03:19.931
Emma, are you trying out

03:19.932 --> 03:21.119
for What Up, Walden?

03:21.160 --> 03:22.308
I don't have to try.

03:22.309 --> 03:23.454
I've got this.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.873
So you both have faces.

03:25.874 --> 03:27.207
Mazel tov.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.357
Being on What Up, Walden?

03:31.358 --> 03:33.505
Could launch my brilliant

03:29.209 --> 03:33.505
career in infotainment!

03:33.547 --> 03:34.591
Infotainment is

03:34.592 --> 03:35.633
not even a word.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.155
Try telling petite media

03:37.156 --> 03:38.385
giant Kelly Ripa that!

03:41.597 --> 03:43.182
Whoa, babe alert!

03:43.432 --> 03:44.809
Emma!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.227
Bryn "Back-stabbing"

03:46.228 --> 03:47.603
Breitbart,

03:47.645 --> 03:48.876
if you're here, who's taking

03:48.877 --> 03:50.106
care of your flying monkeys?

03:52.524 --> 03:53.943
Emma, aren't you

03:53.944 --> 03:55.360
going to introduce

03:52.524 --> 03:55.360
me to your friend?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.862
Diesel Touchdown, sports.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.281
Ow!

04:01.117 --> 04:02.431
She's not my friend!

04:02.432 --> 04:03.744
She's the one who tried

04:01.117 --> 04:03.744
to steal all my friends!

04:04.536 --> 04:06.518
Look, Emma, I am so sorry.

04:06.519 --> 04:08.499
I was horrible to you.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.209
- But I promise
- I've learned my lesson,

04:10.250 --> 04:11.651
- And I really want
- to start over.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.129
Well, I don't.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.860
I'm not asking to be BFF's,

04:15.861 --> 04:17.382
but can we at least be F's?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.468
- Well...
- Please!

04:19.510 --> 04:20.928
- Please, please,
- please, please?

04:20.970 --> 04:22.660
Oh, okay! I hate

04:22.661 --> 04:24.348
holding grudges.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.881
- The stress gives
- me pimples.

04:27.685 --> 04:29.458
Good decision. As the

04:29.459 --> 04:31.230
producer, I cannot put

04:27.685 --> 04:31.230
on people with pimples.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.483
- Emma, Bryn, you two
- will be co-anchors.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.902
- What do you
- think, Ms. Devlin?

04:37.528 --> 04:38.863
I think I should get

04:38.864 --> 04:40.198
in my car and just

04:37.528 --> 04:40.198
keep driving.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.537
(SNORING)

04:46.871 --> 04:47.872
Bertram!

04:48.122 --> 04:49.123
(SCREAMING)

04:49.414 --> 04:51.458
Bertram, are you okay?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.670
I will be as soon as

04:53.671 --> 04:55.546
I get my heart started.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.546
(GRUNTING)

04:55.587 --> 04:57.339
And there we go.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.382
(SIGHS)

04:58.841 --> 05:00.009
I read something

05:00.010 --> 05:01.177
in Jessie's diary!

05:01.510 --> 05:03.304
(GASPS) Stop right there.

05:03.305 --> 05:05.097
That's invading her privacy.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.097
I don't want to hear it.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.641
She got you a present!

05:06.642 --> 05:07.850
Ooh, ooh, tell me!

05:09.101 --> 05:12.001
It's a CD, Pavarotti

05:12.002 --> 05:14.899
and the Backstreet Boys

05:09.101 --> 05:14.899
Live at the Acropolis!

05:15.274 --> 05:16.839
Really? I've been looking for

05:16.840 --> 05:18.402
one of those CDs for years!

05:18.443 --> 05:19.549
They're harder to find than

05:19.550 --> 05:20.654
a good Yoko Ono song!

05:21.739 --> 05:23.074
JESSIE: Bertram!

05:23.115 --> 05:24.366
Act surprised.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.180
- I have a special thank - you gift for
helping me - Watch the kids the other day.

05:28.204 --> 05:29.413
I wonder what it is?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.227
It's a rare,

05:31.228 --> 05:32.457
limited edition

05:32.499 --> 05:33.792
Cheeses of China tie!

05:34.960 --> 05:36.378
They only have three kinds.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.965
Wow! Thanks!

05:40.465 --> 05:42.551
What a total surprise.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.517
There, our set

05:49.518 --> 05:50.559
is complete.

05:50.601 --> 05:51.998
But lose those paintings.

05:51.999 --> 05:53.395
They are an eyesore.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.605
I painted them!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.983
I mean, I sor-t

05:57.984 --> 06:00.485
of love them!

06:02.280 --> 06:03.615
Especially the one

06:03.616 --> 06:04.949
of the adorable monkey.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.702
That's a self-portrait.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.331
Okay.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.273
Ah, my intrepid news

06:16.274 --> 06:18.337
team! So, what stories

06:14.208 --> 06:18.337
do you have for me?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.797
Hand dryers in the

06:19.798 --> 06:21.215
girls' bathroom

06:18.378 --> 06:21.215
are dangerously hot!

06:21.257 --> 06:22.300
We want our hands

06:22.301 --> 06:23.342
dried, not fried!

06:23.383 --> 06:24.927
I like it! Emma, what is

06:24.928 --> 06:26.470
your hard-hitting story?

06:26.511 --> 06:27.617
I think we should

06:27.618 --> 06:28.722
ban goggles in chemistry.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.349
- Even I can't make
- those work.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.893
Eh. I like Bryn's better.

06:32.894 --> 06:34.228
You can do weather.

06:34.270 --> 06:35.729
- But...
- Hold your "but."

06:37.064 --> 06:38.440
We are on in one minute!

06:40.525 --> 06:42.257
So, Ms. Devlin, any last

06:42.258 --> 06:43.988
words of advice for us?

06:44.322 --> 06:45.490
Yes, scooch down,

06:45.491 --> 06:46.657
you're blocking

06:44.322 --> 06:46.657
my paintings.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.180
Oh, and mention they're

06:48.181 --> 06:49.285
for sale on my website!

06:50.661 --> 06:51.913
Okay, Luke,

06:51.914 --> 06:53.164
in three, two...

06:53.538 --> 06:55.395
Hey, this is

06:55.396 --> 06:57.251
Diesel Touchdown, with your

06:53.538 --> 06:57.251
Walden sports report!

06:57.293 --> 06:58.816
Last night the basketball

06:58.817 --> 07:00.338
team lost again.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.443
The only dribbling

07:01.444 --> 07:02.506
they were doing was

07:00.379 --> 07:02.506
from their mouths!

07:02.547 --> 07:03.674
(LAUGHS)

07:03.715 --> 07:05.134
(HORN BLARING)

07:07.052 --> 07:09.471
And now here's Bryn.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.350
You guys can't tell

07:12.351 --> 07:14.018
this on television, but

07:10.681 --> 07:14.018
she smells like happiness.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.064
Thanks, Diesel.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.150
This is Bryn Breitbart here.

07:21.192 --> 07:22.611
Reporting on the

07:22.612 --> 07:24.028
hot hand dryer horror

07:21.192 --> 07:24.028
in the girls' bathroom.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.758
This is the worst thing

07:25.759 --> 07:27.072
to happen to the

07:24.444 --> 07:27.072
ladies' restroom

07:27.114 --> 07:28.428
since the great seat-cover

07:28.429 --> 07:29.741
shortage of 2010.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.140
And now, here's Emma Ross

07:32.141 --> 07:33.412
with the weather.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.103
Well, it's room

07:36.104 --> 07:37.541
temperature, because

07:37.582 --> 07:38.542
we're in a room.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.003
Cut! And we are out!

07:41.461 --> 07:43.068
What about my paintings?

07:43.069 --> 07:44.673
Great show, everyone!

07:44.715 --> 07:46.258
Not for me! I don't want

07:46.259 --> 07:47.801
to do the weather.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.720
- It's not info,
- or tainment!

07:50.929 --> 07:52.723
If you wish to get more

07:52.724 --> 07:54.516
air time, bring me a real

07:50.929 --> 07:54.516
news story, like Bryn's.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.537
- I'm sure you'll come up
- with something great, Emma.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.896
Help!

08:02.274 --> 08:04.214
I assume that was

08:04.215 --> 08:06.153
just good-natured

08:02.274 --> 08:06.153
rough housing?

08:06.445 --> 08:08.030
That's what I'm going with,

08:08.031 --> 08:09.614
otherwise I have to do

08:06.445 --> 08:09.614
a lot of paperwork.

08:14.912 --> 08:16.164
Hey, Bertram.

08:16.165 --> 08:17.415
Why aren't you wearing

08:14.912 --> 08:17.415
the new tie I bought you?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.834
Oh, because... I...

08:20.876 --> 08:22.378
Wait, why am I trying

08:22.379 --> 08:23.879
to spare your feelings?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.879
I hate it. It's hideous.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.195
Okay, here's a tip.

08:27.196 --> 08:28.800
Don't start drowning if

08:25.589 --> 08:28.800
I'm the only one around.

08:30.594 --> 08:31.803
I'm sorry, Jessie.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.489
- It's just that Zuri said
- you were getting me

08:33.513 --> 08:34.994
Pavarotti and the

08:34.995 --> 08:36.475
Backstreet Boys

08:33.513 --> 08:36.475
Live at the Acropolis!

08:36.808 --> 08:37.808
Oh, I wanted to,

08:37.809 --> 08:38.809
but I couldn't afford it.

08:39.270 --> 08:40.625
Oh, I didn't know you

08:40.626 --> 08:41.980
could put a price

08:39.270 --> 08:41.980
on my happiness...

08:43.107 --> 08:44.462
I can. It's anything

08:44.463 --> 08:45.817
under $20.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.381
- Wait a minute, how would
- Zuri even know that?

08:49.405 --> 08:50.698
She read your diary.

08:50.699 --> 08:51.990
(GASPS) She did!

08:52.408 --> 08:53.451
Well, thank goodness

08:53.452 --> 08:54.493
I have no life!

08:56.495 --> 08:58.414
Of course you do!

08:58.456 --> 08:59.853
In fact, you should think

08:59.854 --> 09:01.250
of turning that smoothie

08:58.456 --> 09:01.250
adventure into a movie.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.542
- It was awesome. - I got like a glass
- And a half!

09:07.465 --> 09:08.946
I still can't believe

09:08.947 --> 09:10.426
Zuri would invade

09:07.465 --> 09:10.426
my privacy like that!

09:10.884 --> 09:12.511
Hmm, welcome to my world.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.347
At least she didn't go

09:14.348 --> 09:15.597
through your Hope Chest.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.161
You still have hope?

09:17.162 --> 09:18.683
Not much.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.683
It's a very small chest.

09:20.478 --> 09:22.229
- Okay, we gotta teach
- Zuri a lesson.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.210
I just wish I could

09:24.211 --> 09:25.357
do what my dad did

09:23.063 --> 09:25.357
when I was bad.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.025
Well, why can't you?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.708
- I don't think you're - allowed
to dig latrines - In Central Park.

09:36.535 --> 09:37.577
Dear diary...

09:40.831 --> 09:42.479
It's getting harder

09:42.480 --> 09:44.126
and harder to keep

09:40.831 --> 09:44.126
my big secret.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.423
Boy, am I thirsty.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.196
I think I'll go make

09:51.197 --> 09:52.301
myself some tea,

09:52.343 --> 09:54.366
which should take

09:54.367 --> 09:56.388
at least five minutes

09:52.343 --> 09:56.388
and all my attention.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.393
What secret?

10:05.689 --> 10:06.690
(GASPING)

10:07.358 --> 10:09.401
No way!

10:11.611 --> 10:13.134
So all of those

10:13.135 --> 10:14.656
lame entries were

10:11.611 --> 10:14.656
just a cover!

10:14.698 --> 10:16.450
- I knew no one
- could be that boring!

10:18.285 --> 10:20.037
- I'll show her
- who's boring.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.101
Ooh, it's 8:30,

10:21.102 --> 10:22.122
my knitting show is on!

10:25.417 --> 10:26.418
Okay, I'm here.

10:26.419 --> 10:27.419
What do you need?

10:27.461 --> 10:28.567
For you to get

10:28.568 --> 10:29.671
in that trash can!

10:27.461 --> 10:29.671
Okay.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.303
- By the way,
- why am I in here?

10:37.429 --> 10:39.014
Because someone texted me

10:39.015 --> 10:40.599
that evidence of a big,

10:37.429 --> 10:40.599
breaking news story

10:40.640 --> 10:42.351
- would be left in
- this garbage can.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.728
- Do you see
- anything evidence-y?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.835
Nah. Just orange peels,

10:46.836 --> 10:48.357
half a retainer,

10:48.399 --> 10:50.359
what I'm hoping is not vomit,

10:50.401 --> 10:51.548
and this envelope marked

10:51.549 --> 10:52.694
"evidence."

10:53.237 --> 10:54.676
(GASPS) Give me

10:54.677 --> 10:56.114
that! Nimrod.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.537
O-M-G!

11:01.579 --> 11:03.122
When I bring Ravi this story,

11:03.123 --> 11:04.664
I'll never have to do

11:01.579 --> 11:04.664
the weather again!

11:05.457 --> 11:06.708
Glad I could help!

11:07.251 --> 11:08.377
(CRUNCHING)

11:08.627 --> 11:09.670
And I think

11:09.671 --> 11:10.712
something just bit me.

11:11.380 --> 11:12.839
- Oh, hey!
- (MUFFLED SCREAM)

11:15.384 --> 11:16.969
Ravi, I've got a scoop!

11:16.970 --> 11:18.554
I live for scoops!

11:19.137 --> 11:20.348
Ms. Devlin, can I do

11:20.349 --> 11:21.557
a special report?

11:21.599 --> 11:23.038
Who cares? Someone

11:23.039 --> 11:24.476
wants to buy my art!

11:24.518 --> 11:25.624
And not just for the

11:25.625 --> 11:26.728
picture frame this time!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.108
- Okay people,
- we are going live!

11:31.149 --> 11:32.734
Emma, get to the desk.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.319
Luke, stop staring at Bryn.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.904
I wasn't! Okay,

11:35.905 --> 11:36.988
I totally was.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.700
Good luck with

11:39.701 --> 11:40.992
your story, Emma.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.992
I'm so proud of you.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.412
Thanks, Bryn.

11:42.413 --> 11:43.454
That is so sweet...

11:43.495 --> 11:45.456
Ladies, can the chit-chat!

11:45.457 --> 11:47.416
You can braid each

11:43.495 --> 11:47.416
other's hair later!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.337
Okay, people

11:51.338 --> 11:52.630

11:55.757 --> 11:57.259
This is Emma Ross with

11:57.260 --> 11:58.760
"Crisis in the Cafeteria."

11:58.802 --> 12:00.575
I've uncovered shocking

12:00.576 --> 12:02.347
proof that Walden's

11:58.802 --> 12:02.347
hamburgers are actually

12:02.389 --> 12:03.682
horseburgers!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.373
This is a signed receipt

12:07.374 --> 12:09.020

Grade (NEIGHS) horse meat

12:10.397 --> 12:11.815

12:12.274 --> 12:13.338
Remember that pony

12:13.339 --> 12:14.401
you wanted for Christmas?

12:14.443 --> 12:15.549
Chances are, it's stuck

12:15.550 --> 12:16.654
between your teeth.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.407
More on this breaking

12:19.408 --> 12:20.491
story as it develops.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.493
And we are out!

12:22.534 --> 12:23.952
That was brilliant!

12:26.288 --> 12:27.289
What?

12:27.747 --> 12:28.874
Don't tell me, you're

12:28.875 --> 12:30.000
all vegetarians?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.086
We are now.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.886
Bertram, Jessie

12:39.887 --> 12:41.345
is an alien!

12:41.386 --> 12:43.368
Now, Zuri, Texas

12:43.369 --> 12:45.349
may be strange, but

12:41.386 --> 12:45.349
it is part of this country.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.164
She's not from Texas,

12:48.165 --> 12:50.061
she's from the

12:46.266 --> 12:50.061
planet Tsuris!

12:50.437 --> 12:51.981
She's here to gather

12:51.982 --> 12:53.524
information so

12:50.437 --> 12:53.524
they can invade Earth!

12:53.815 --> 12:55.505
Really? Well, that would

12:55.506 --> 12:57.194
explain who she's

12:53.815 --> 12:57.194
texting all the time.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.112
- We know she doesn't
- have any friends.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.928
It also explains

13:01.929 --> 13:03.575
those tennis rackets

13:00.280 --> 13:03.575
she calls feet!

She drinks through

her finger!

13:31.353 --> 13:32.354

13:32.355 --> 13:33.355

I haven't seen this

many smiling faces

13:44.491 --> 13:46.368
- since that health

13:46.410 --> 13:47.411
(LAUGHS)

13:48.412 --> 13:50.223
- Emma Ross! You are - in big trouble,
- Young lady!

13:50.247 --> 13:51.811
You have ruined

13:51.812 --> 13:53.375
the reputation of

What Up, Walden?

13:53.417 --> 13:55.336
What are you talking about?

13:55.337 --> 13:57.254
It turns out your

13:53.417 --> 13:57.254
big scoop was poop!

13:59.172 --> 14:02.300
grey and repellent,

14:02.342 --> 14:05.053
is in fact cow, not horse!

14:05.095 --> 14:06.409
But I found

14:06.410 --> 14:07.723
a receipt in the garbage!

14:05.095 --> 14:07.723

to work as a janitor

had this texted you.

Let me see that.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.293
Hey, someone used

15:59.294 --> 16:00.544
this phone to text me

16:00.585 --> 16:01.816
that bogus story tip

16:01.817 --> 16:03.046
about the horse meat!

16:03.714 --> 16:05.525
- This could lead me to
- the person who destroyed

16:05.549 --> 16:06.654
My reputation as

16:06.655 --> 16:07.759
a serious infotainer!

16:10.303 --> 16:11.493
You can keep on saying it,

16:11.494 --> 16:12.681
it's still not a word!

Hi, guys. What's up?

Yes, Jessie.

Okay. So my hair needs

16:25.445 --> 16:27.487

red. It's not a crime.

I'll tell you what's a crime,

16:31.013 --> 16:33.117
being an alien spy

16:28.906 --> 16:33.117
from outer space!

16:34.118 --> 16:35.850
Well, actually, I'm not

16:35.851 --> 16:37.581
sure if that's a crime,

16:34.118 --> 16:37.581
but it's still not good!

Admit it, or else!

16:42.669 --> 16:44.213
Zuri, I am not an alien.

16:44.214 --> 16:45.756
I put my pants on one

16:42.669 --> 16:45.756
tentacle at a time...

16:45.797 --> 16:47.078
- (GASPS)
- just like everyone...

16:47.298 --> 16:48.299
(GASPS)

16:48.550 --> 16:49.573
Did I say that out

16:49.574 --> 16:50.594
loud? Gleep glork!

16:52.136 --> 16:53.847
I knew it!

16:53.889 --> 16:55.453
So now you know.

16:55.454 --> 16:57.016
What do you plan on

16:53.889 --> 16:57.016
doing about it, Earth scum?

16:57.475 --> 16:59.394
- Well, there's no need
- for name calling.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.648
We are going to

17:02.649 --> 17:04.398
stop you, you evil

17:00.896 --> 17:04.398
alien-type space thing!

17:06.150 --> 17:08.007
Ha! Now you've been

17:08.008 --> 17:09.863
caught in my freeze ray,

17:06.150 --> 17:09.863
you nurling floog!

17:10.195 --> 17:11.490
You pathetic humans

17:11.491 --> 17:12.782
can't stop me.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.867
Who you callin' human?

17:15.285 --> 17:16.578
News-flash!

17:16.579 --> 17:17.871
I am also an alien,

17:17.913 --> 17:20.290
sent to Earth as a baby from

17:20.290 --> 17:22.666
the planet Mmm-Hmm 1138.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.963
Okay. Nice try, Zuri. Now

17:25.964 --> 17:27.380
let's stop playing games,

17:27.422 --> 17:28.924
and have a little chat about

17:28.925 --> 17:30.425
respecting people's privacy.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.532
We can chat on the mothership,

17:32.533 --> 17:34.596
after I destroy this planet.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.286
Zuri, that toy does

17:36.287 --> 17:37.307
not scare me.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.520
- Okay, it scares
- me a little.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.989
Bertram, do something!

17:52.990 --> 17:54.532
You don't have to pretend

17:51.446 --> 17:54.532
to be frozen anymore.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.847
I'm not pretending,

17:55.848 --> 17:57.118
I'm petrified!

17:58.536 --> 18:00.455
Have a seat, Jessie.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.897
Jumpin' J.J. Abrams!

18:04.898 --> 18:06.377
What is going on?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.676
How is this happening?

18:13.259 --> 18:14.761
I'm making it happen.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.680
I always knew there was

18:16.681 --> 18:17.764
something weird about her!

18:18.389 --> 18:19.454
No offense,

18:19.455 --> 18:20.517
alien overlord.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.207
On my planet,

18:23.208 --> 18:24.938
you'll be my slaves!

18:25.396 --> 18:27.357
- Oh, so not much
- is gonna change?

18:28.817 --> 18:30.610
This is ridiculous!

18:30.611 --> 18:32.403
There is no way

18:28.817 --> 18:32.403
Zuri is an alien!

18:32.779 --> 18:33.780
Oh, yeah?

18:36.616 --> 18:37.639
Don't probe me!

18:37.640 --> 18:38.660
You were always

18:36.616 --> 18:38.660
my favorite!

18:40.537 --> 18:41.537
Suckers!

18:41.746 --> 18:43.164
She's got suckers?

18:43.206 --> 18:44.311
She's gonna suck

18:44.312 --> 18:45.416
our faces off!

18:46.835 --> 18:48.628
I meant you guys are

18:48.629 --> 18:50.421
suckers! I'm not an alien.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.093
You're not?

18:55.343 --> 18:56.386
But then how do you

18:56.387 --> 18:57.428
explain the zap,

18:57.470 --> 18:58.555
and the boom,

18:58.556 --> 18:59.639
and the whoosh

18:57.470 --> 18:59.639
and the...

19:01.474 --> 19:03.476
Well, after I saw

19:03.477 --> 19:05.478
your lame finger-slurping

19:01.474 --> 19:05.478
trick,

19:05.520 --> 19:06.626
I realized you and Bertram

19:06.627 --> 19:07.731
were punking me.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.608
So I paid Dad's special

19:10.609 --> 19:12.944
effects guy to rig this

19:08.272 --> 19:12.944
place with invisible wires.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.073
See?

19:19.868 --> 19:20.891
Okay, her allowance

19:20.892 --> 19:21.912
is way too big.

19:22.913 --> 19:24.519
So you can manage

19:24.520 --> 19:26.124
to set up this whole

19:22.913 --> 19:26.124
elaborate scam,

19:26.165 --> 19:28.126
- but you can't manage
- to hang up your coat?

19:28.585 --> 19:29.585
Weird, huh?

19:31.212 --> 19:32.714
- So much for teaching
- you a lesson.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.924
I know. I never

19:34.925 --> 19:36.509
should've read your diary.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.469
I'm really sorry, Jessie.

19:39.721 --> 19:40.722
I accept your apology,

19:40.723 --> 19:41.723
but promise you'll

19:39.721 --> 19:41.723
never do it again.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.391
I promise.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.935
And I promise no

19:44.936 --> 19:46.436
more special effects.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.146
Oh, thank goodness.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.356
(SCREAMING)

19:51.733 --> 19:52.818
(CRASHING)

19:52.819 --> 19:53.902
(BERTRAM SCREAMS)

19:53.944 --> 19:55.403
Starting now.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.575
- I got your
- text to meet.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.766
Aww, Emma,

20:02.767 --> 20:04.454
you look so cute in your

20:01.076 --> 20:04.454
garbage girl outfit.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.082
- You're the one
- who's garbage, girl!

20:07.457 --> 20:09.375
- Ooh, things
- just got real!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.419
- Emma, let me - hold your hoops!
- Come on.

20:14.589 --> 20:15.715
Bryn, I know

20:15.716 --> 20:16.841
you set me up.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.301
Why would you think that?

20:19.510 --> 20:21.614
- Because this phone has your
- make-up shade all over it.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.264
- Who else wears
- Vampire White?

20:24.515 --> 20:25.997
How dare you! It happens

20:25.998 --> 20:27.477
to be Apparition Eggshell.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.396
I can't believe I

20:30.397 --> 20:31.397
actually thought you

20:29.395 --> 20:31.397
had changed.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.149
Please! Like I would ever

20:33.150 --> 20:34.859
share the spotlight with you.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.403
Face it, Emma,

20:36.404 --> 20:37.445
I always get what I want.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.406
And what I want

20:39.407 --> 20:40.740
is to have the show

20:38.071 --> 20:40.740
all to myself.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.847
That's it! You are

20:42.848 --> 20:44.327
officially off my

20:41.365 --> 20:44.327
fantasy girlfriend list.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.497
- That's right,
- I have a list!

20:49.207 --> 20:51.292
You Rosses are finished.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.420
All I have to do is get your

20:53.421 --> 20:55.505
wimpy little brother fired,

20:51.334 --> 20:55.505
and the show is all mine.

20:55.964 --> 20:56.987
RAVI: That will not

20:56.988 --> 20:58.008
happen, you she-devil!

21:00.384 --> 21:02.220
You have been

21:02.221 --> 21:04.055
caught like a sleepy

21:00.384 --> 21:04.055
turtle in a coracle's net!

21:06.016 --> 21:08.205
That is a type of Indian

21:08.206 --> 21:10.394
boat! Stop texting, and

21:06.016 --> 21:10.394
start traveling, people!

21:11.855 --> 21:12.939
Ba-boosh!

21:14.649 --> 21:16.752
- Too bad for you - our brother fits
- Comfortably inside a locker.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.257
My knees are in my arm-pits.

21:18.258 --> 21:19.737
Do I look comfortable?

21:21.322 --> 21:22.929
So, here's what's going

21:22.930 --> 21:24.534
to happen next, Bryn.

21:24.575 --> 21:26.036
Either you confess to

21:26.037 --> 21:27.495
Ms. Devlin so I get back

21:24.575 --> 21:27.495
on What Up, Walden?

21:27.537 --> 21:28.705
Or I play this video

21:28.706 --> 21:29.873
to the whole school.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.666
- You would
- actually do that?

21:32.876 --> 21:34.812
- Duh, that's why we - crammed our little
- Brother in a locker.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.420
- We wouldn't do
- that for no reason.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.857
- But Luke gave no
- reason last week...

21:37.881 --> 21:39.153
Ravi, we're busy blackmailing

21:39.154 --> 21:40.424
Bryn right now. Focus.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.720
Fine, you win.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.972
- I'll go tell Ms.
- Devlin the truth.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.912
And speaking as the producer,

21:47.913 --> 21:49.809
we will not miss you at

21:46.014 --> 21:49.809
What Up, Walden?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.395
- Fine. I'll just take
- over the yearbook!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.147
And I don't care how many

21:54.148 --> 21:55.857
clubs you join, none

21:52.436 --> 21:55.857
of you are making it in.

21:55.899 --> 21:56.900
Peace!

21:57.192 --> 21:58.193
(SCREAMING)

21:59.402 --> 22:00.570
- Are you
- all right, Ravi?

22:00.904 --> 22:02.364
Not really. I am sitting

22:02.365 --> 22:03.823
on an umbrella.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.576
Which just opened.

22:11.372 --> 22:12.707
So, I am now the

22:12.708 --> 22:14.042
sole anchor of

22:11.372 --> 22:14.042
What Up, Walden?

22:14.084 --> 22:15.919
- And Bryn is
- on garbage detail.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.897
- I'm just glad - everything worked out
- For you guys.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.381
Me too. Hey, would

22:19.382 --> 22:20.840
you guys like

22:17.921 --> 22:20.840
a snack?

22:21.216 --> 22:22.217
ALL: Sure!

22:29.224 --> 22:30.225
(ALL SCREAMING)

22:32.727 --> 22:34.020
This is fun.
