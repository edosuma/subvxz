We've got everything we want
right here.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.960
Come on, guys. Let's get
out of here.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.500
Whew! What a crazy place,
am I right?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.960
Yeah. You can make, like,
whatever.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.120
That was a pretty cool bike
you made, Marco.

10:19.670 --> 10:21.670
You named him "Wheelie"
and everything.

10:21.670 --> 10:23.080
But, hey, you told them,

10:23.080 --> 10:25.500
"Who needs stuff
when you've got friends?"

10:25.500 --> 10:28.540
Yeah! It's not like stuff
ever cares about ya.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.880
[Star laughs]
Yeah!

10:31.920 --> 10:34.080
[both]
Bye, Marco!

10:34.080 --> 10:35.500
[bell rings]

10:35.500 --> 10:38.880
[sighs] You know,
I'm really gonna miss Quest Buy.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.080
We have got so many
memories here.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.500
Yeah. It's a shame
it's gonna be wiped
from existence.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.170
-[Janna] Never to be
seen from again.
-Wait.

10:47.170 --> 10:48.460
I need to go get something!

10:48.460 --> 10:52.080
I'm sorry, but Quest Buy
is now closed.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.420
But... but I need to save
the babies!

10:54.420 --> 10:58.960
Thank you, local customers,
for shopping at Quest Buy.

10:58.960 --> 11:02.080
Have a good... whatever.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.420
What a weird, weird,

11:05.420 --> 11:08.080
sometimes terrifying,
magical place.
