WEBVTT

00:12.794 --> 00:15.263
These rock. Seriously.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.899
Better than last week's.
Wanna taste one?

00:22.370 --> 00:24.532
No? Really?

00:24.706 --> 00:26.800
Okay. Fine. Suit yourself.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.604
There's a whole world out there,
other than kibble,

00:29.777 --> 00:32.906
that you're just never gonna taste.
You have to live with that, not me.

00:39.187 --> 00:41.747
Aw. Big bad Bubba
got his feelings hurt?

00:43.825 --> 00:46.726
What's the matter, tough guy,
you can't find your binky?

00:48.763 --> 00:50.197
Bubba?

00:50.632 --> 00:52.100
Bubba?

00:52.967 --> 00:55.937
Bubba, what are you doing there?

00:57.005 --> 00:58.632
How did you open the door?

00:59.541 --> 01:01.066
Bubba?

01:03.878 --> 01:04.902
Aah!

01:05.078 --> 01:06.478
Help!

01:35.910 --> 01:36.934
Help! Help me!

01:38.646 --> 01:40.045
Please. Please help me.

01:40.215 --> 01:41.239
Oh, my God. Help me.

02:04.973 --> 02:06.737
I think Michelle was right.

02:06.908 --> 02:08.467
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Heh.

02:08.643 --> 02:10.683
- It's just not very Christmas-y.
- It was one card.

02:10.812 --> 02:12.302
Not all of the cards, just one.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.882
I read it, she read it. I got an update
on my buddy's family and I tossed it.

02:17.752 --> 02:19.550
The card had glitter on it.

02:19.721 --> 02:22.281
- So, what do you have against glitter?
- It's the devil's dust.

02:22.457 --> 02:24.551
Once that stuff infects your house,
it's a wrap.

02:24.726 --> 02:27.024
All right, that in itself
is a therapy session.

02:27.195 --> 02:30.221
All I'm saying is, you ought to display
your holiday cards.

02:30.398 --> 02:31.524
- Display them?
- Yeah.

02:31.699 --> 02:33.428
Put them on your fireplace,
show them off.

02:33.601 --> 02:34.932
I don't have a fireplace.

02:35.103 --> 02:38.164
Then put them on a decorative ribbon.
I've seen that done before.

02:38.339 --> 02:39.704
How many holidays cards do you get

02:39.874 --> 02:41.569
besides the one
from the Hanna household?

02:41.743 --> 02:43.063
- Me personally? Not many.
- Yeah.

02:43.211 --> 02:45.202
But my aliases pull about,
I don't know, 50?

02:45.380 --> 02:47.815
- Mele Kalikimaka, boys.
- Heh.

02:47.982 --> 02:49.780
- Deeks.
- Uh-huh.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.751
What do you do with the holiday cards
you get?

02:51.886 --> 02:53.820
What are you talking about?
Display them.

02:53.988 --> 02:56.218
- Thank you.
- Oh, wait, let me guess,

02:56.391 --> 02:59.292
you're making lanyards out of paracord
then hanging the cards on those?

02:59.460 --> 03:01.622
See, red and green paracord
would be sick.

03:01.796 --> 03:03.992
- Not a bad idea.
- That's what I'm talking about.

03:04.165 --> 03:07.601
- Okay, if...? And I emphasize "if."
- -l was to display them,

03:07.769 --> 03:09.249
how long would I have
to keep them up?

03:09.404 --> 03:11.304
Ahem. January 3rd.

03:11.873 --> 03:13.307
- January 3rd?
- Minimum.

03:13.474 --> 03:14.703
Minimum.

03:15.576 --> 03:17.271
Come on, guys. We caught a case.

03:22.617 --> 03:25.382
This morning, downtown,
home invasion.

03:25.553 --> 03:29.456
Ooh. Somebody put a BOLO out
on Krampus.

03:30.325 --> 03:33.761
Krampus is a Christmas demon
from the Alps, steals children.

03:34.062 --> 03:35.393
Never mind. I'll stop talking.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.622
- What'd he take, Nell?
- Nothing.

03:37.799 --> 03:39.528
The homeowner, Lily Lockhart,

03:39.701 --> 03:41.863
fought him off with the help
of her Belgian Malinois.

03:42.036 --> 03:44.971
Bubba was shot.
He's in surgery at the vet.

03:45.139 --> 03:46.834
I'm guessing
if the case showed up here,

03:47.008 --> 03:48.498
she's related to Senator Lockhart?

03:48.676 --> 03:49.837
Daughter.

03:50.011 --> 03:51.536
And the State Department
wants to know

03:51.713 --> 03:54.011
if it was more
than just a random home invasion.

03:54.182 --> 03:57.277
- Where's the senator now?
- Right here in L.A. Winter recess.

03:57.452 --> 03:59.682
U.S. Capitol Police has been with him
already,

03:59.854 --> 04:01.185
so he's secured at his office.

04:01.689 --> 04:04.056
Why was he traveling
with Capitol Police protection?

04:04.225 --> 04:06.159
The senator's been spearheading
an investigation

04:06.327 --> 04:09.786
into China's People's
Liberation Army Unit 61398.

04:09.964 --> 04:11.227
China's cyber warfare unit.

04:11.399 --> 04:13.663
Tech geniuses
with English language skills.

04:13.835 --> 04:15.496
They're suspected
of cyber espionage

04:15.670 --> 04:18.833
and large-scale hacking
of U.S. tech and aerospace firms.

04:19.406 --> 04:21.535
There's been chatter
that the PLA is not thrilled

04:21.709 --> 04:23.006
with the senator's new agenda.

04:23.177 --> 04:26.636
But with Capitol Police protection,
the senator's a hard mark to hit.

04:26.814 --> 04:30.546
If the PLA's here and they attack
the senator's daughter on our soil,

04:30.718 --> 04:32.550
we got to put them down.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.348
My feeling exactly, Mr. Hanna.

04:35.523 --> 04:37.150
Where is Lily now?

04:37.325 --> 04:38.656
L.A.P.D.'s Alvarado station.

04:38.826 --> 04:42.694
I'd like you gentlemen to secure
Miss Lockhart in protective custody,

04:42.864 --> 04:44.992
bring her to the boatshed
for an interview.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.656
You got it.

04:47.201 --> 04:49.898
And you two can go interview
the senator.

04:50.071 --> 04:51.470
The two of...?

04:51.639 --> 04:52.663
You mean the two of me?

04:53.040 --> 04:56.135
I want you and Nell
to see the senator,

04:56.310 --> 05:00.269
find out if he knows anything
about these Chinese PLA threats.

05:00.448 --> 05:02.883
Me and Nellosaurus?

05:03.050 --> 05:06.281
Yes, I move fast, Mr. Deeks.
Gotta keep up.

05:06.454 --> 05:08.320
- Let's go, Shaggy.
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:08.623 --> 05:11.354
Well played. I'm with you, Velma.

05:11.526 --> 05:14.496
Just for the record,
this is a terrific idea.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.391
Terrific.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.368
They told me Bubba's in surgery

05:20.535 --> 05:24.028
so we'll have to stop
at the animal hospital on Wilshire.

05:24.205 --> 05:27.072
I'm sorry, Miss Lockhart, we need
to take you to a secured location

05:27.241 --> 05:30.040
- until we can determine a threat level.
- Okay. Miss Lockhart? No.

05:30.211 --> 05:32.305
How about we just go with just Lily?

05:32.480 --> 05:35.415
Okay, Lily. We have agents on the way
to speak to your father.

05:35.583 --> 05:36.983
- And when we get there...
- My dad?

05:37.084 --> 05:38.609
What does my dad
have to do with this?

05:38.786 --> 05:40.618
The police told me
it was a home invasion.

05:41.189 --> 05:42.816
We're looking into that angle also.

05:42.990 --> 05:46.392
Wow, that's great.
I don't talk to him for two years,

05:46.561 --> 05:49.801
and he still picks the most perfect time
to come into my life and screw it all up.

05:50.898 --> 05:53.230
So the guy that attacked me
was looking for my father?

05:53.401 --> 05:55.563
- We haven't determined that.
- Oh.

05:56.070 --> 05:59.370
Cool. "Hey, Lil, why weren't you
at my Christmas party?"

05:59.540 --> 06:03.340
"Oh, because I was being detained
at a magical secured location.”

06:03.511 --> 06:05.104
Awesome.

06:08.916 --> 06:10.247
Thanks, Mac.

06:10.418 --> 06:12.910
How is she? Did you see Lily?

06:13.087 --> 06:14.350
No, we didn't see her, sir.

06:15.823 --> 06:18.349
So NCIS thinks this attack
has something to do with me?

06:18.526 --> 06:21.257
We are looking into every possibility,
senator.

06:21.429 --> 06:23.625
Recently, you've been very vocal
in the press

06:23.798 --> 06:26.324
about Chinese PLA Unit 61398.

06:26.501 --> 06:29.095
That unit's dangerous. They need
to be monitored and dealt with

06:29.270 --> 06:32.171
as intensely as any threat
to our national security.

06:32.340 --> 06:35.401
Police are investigating the threats.
Do you think the PLA's behind those?

06:35.576 --> 06:37.476
I don't know.
That's Neidra Industries' theory.

06:37.645 --> 06:38.942
Government contracting firm?

06:39.113 --> 06:41.582
Yeah, they're specialists
in cyber warfare tactics.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.446
They discovered the chatter
and deemed it a threat.

06:44.619 --> 06:47.384
We'll follow up with Neidra,
and, uh, if you think of anything else.

06:47.555 --> 06:49.649
I'll contact you if I do.

06:50.925 --> 06:55.453
Uh, after the attack on Lily,
didn't you wanna go see her?

06:56.664 --> 07:00.066
When I called the police station,
they told me she wouldn't see me.

07:00.368 --> 07:02.598
The price I pay for spending more time
with my Army unit

07:02.770 --> 07:04.966
than I did with her
when she was growing up.

07:05.139 --> 07:09.201
- Mm. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- It's okay.

07:10.211 --> 07:12.043
Lily's strong.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.838
She's learned to do without.

07:15.650 --> 07:18.119
- Thank you, senator.
- Thank you.

07:24.392 --> 07:27.828
I'm sorry if I came off a little...
It's just that my father and I

07:27.995 --> 07:30.930
- don't really have a good thing.
- It's all good.

07:32.066 --> 07:33.431
You remind me of my dad's friends.

07:34.835 --> 07:36.769
Your dad's got good taste.

07:36.938 --> 07:39.839
- You with SF?
- I was with the Teams.

07:40.007 --> 07:41.907
So you're a SEAL, huh?

07:42.443 --> 07:43.933
Got a workout DVD
you wanna sell me?

07:47.815 --> 07:49.874
So you're the SEAL.
What's your story?

07:50.051 --> 07:52.543
- Yeah, what's your story, G?
- Wait, no, let me guess.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.690
Um, rich kid turned lawyer
turned NCIS agent.

07:55.856 --> 07:57.255
- Rich kid?
- Yeah.

07:57.425 --> 07:59.826
You got this kind of country-club vibe
about you.

07:59.994 --> 08:02.053
I bet you tuck in your shirt
when no one's looking.

08:03.431 --> 08:06.958
This job does not exactly support
the, uh, country-club lifestyle.

08:07.935 --> 08:09.767
What do you do to pay the bills,
Lily?

08:09.937 --> 08:11.564
Private chef. I do slow food.

08:11.739 --> 08:13.969
Oh, I'm all about the slow-food thing.

08:14.141 --> 08:16.872
- What the hell is slow food?
- It's eating what's around you.

08:17.044 --> 08:18.671
Watching it grow.

08:18.846 --> 08:21.076
- Knowing your food, G.
- Impressive.

08:21.682 --> 08:24.242
- I know my food.
- Oh, yeah?

08:24.418 --> 08:26.477
- What'd you have last night?
- A burger.

08:26.654 --> 08:30.318
- Okay, do you know the cow's name?
- Mac.

08:32.025 --> 08:33.049
And he was big.

08:34.962 --> 08:37.727
- Ha, ha. Okay. Mm-hm.
- You see what I'm up against?

08:37.898 --> 08:40.890
Try making informed food decisions
with this guy for a partner.

08:41.068 --> 08:43.900
Do you have any idea
how far that burger had to travel...?

08:47.675 --> 08:50.474
- Funnel.
- Lily, get down. Punch it, G. Go! Go!

09:10.364 --> 09:11.661
Come on, come on, come on.

09:11.832 --> 09:13.300
Down, down, down.

09:25.646 --> 09:26.943
Loading.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.109
Long guns and go bags
are in the trunk.

09:31.652 --> 09:33.381
Trunk's too exposed. I can't get to it.

09:33.554 --> 09:35.352
- Cover me.
- Um...

09:40.895 --> 09:43.387
- On three.
- What happens on three?

09:43.564 --> 09:45.589
They're coming quick.
How about on two, huh?

09:50.237 --> 09:51.295
Can I know the plan?

09:51.472 --> 09:53.531
On two, you're gonna run
like a bat out of hell.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.376
One.

09:56.711 --> 09:58.236
Two.

10:00.548 --> 10:02.016
Stay down. Stay down.

10:24.939 --> 10:26.202
Oh, my God.

10:52.532 --> 10:54.091
Stay here.

10:56.536 --> 10:57.765
Hetty, we got ambushed.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.234
Civilian is secured.

10:59.405 --> 11:02.272
No injuries,
minimum two shooters still mobile.

11:02.442 --> 11:03.466
Clear.

11:03.643 --> 11:06.078
Copy that, Sam.
We've locked your GPS position.

11:06.246 --> 11:07.441
QRF is en route.

11:07.614 --> 11:09.013
Copy.

11:09.182 --> 11:10.581
QRF is on its way.

11:11.217 --> 11:12.275
What's a QRF?

11:12.452 --> 11:13.476
Quick Reaction Force.

11:13.653 --> 11:15.621
We got to hunker down.
They'll be here soon.

11:15.789 --> 11:18.417
Okay, heroes on the way.

11:18.591 --> 11:20.081
Okay.

11:30.637 --> 11:33.106
- Morning.
- Morning.

11:33.740 --> 11:35.105
Where is everybody?

11:35.275 --> 11:36.765
Well, I sent Harris to Athens,

11:36.943 --> 11:39.435
and Booker and a couple of the others
to Istanbul.

11:39.612 --> 11:42.309
- What for?
- Little R & R for the holidays.

11:42.482 --> 11:47.044
Really? Wow, that was nice of you.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.190
It wasn't for them. It was for me.
I got tired of hearing them whine.

11:50.356 --> 11:52.017
They're living in this motor home,

11:52.192 --> 11:56.060
hot running water,
satellite TV, Internet.

11:56.229 --> 11:58.789
When I was in the field,
we were lucky if we scored a tent.

11:58.965 --> 12:01.866
Yeah, I bet you walked ten miles
to school in the snow too.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.530
Don't suppose
you're sending me to L.A.? Heh.

12:08.041 --> 12:10.169
- Paris?
- No.

12:11.878 --> 12:13.471
What have we got?

12:13.646 --> 12:15.512
Satellite spotted
several groups of men

12:15.682 --> 12:18.014
hightailing toward Pakistan
last night.

12:19.085 --> 12:20.109
Mujahideen?

12:20.286 --> 12:22.482
If they weren't, they will be soon.

12:22.655 --> 12:24.953
My guess is they're inmates
the Taliban busted out

12:25.124 --> 12:26.421
of Zarghun Shar Prison.

12:26.593 --> 12:28.527
Makes sense.
Jailbreak a few criminals,

12:28.695 --> 12:30.561
give them weapons, instant army.

12:30.730 --> 12:31.930
There's also been a big uptick

12:32.098 --> 12:35.363
in the amount of money
moving through the hawala networks.

12:35.535 --> 12:38.129
It's often a precursor
to a major attack.

12:38.738 --> 12:40.331
We gotta find that White Ghost.

12:43.276 --> 12:45.677
Blye, you remember Agent Sabatino,
CIA.

12:46.279 --> 12:48.077
Special Activities Division.

12:48.248 --> 12:50.546
- Hey.
- Yeah, hey.

12:51.584 --> 12:52.983
So how'd you make out?

12:53.419 --> 12:55.945
Well, they were over the border
before we could engage them.

12:56.122 --> 12:57.590
We put the ANA on high alert

12:57.757 --> 13:00.749
and they're, uh, doubling the patrols
along that stretch.

13:01.327 --> 13:03.056
Let me know if anything changes.

13:03.229 --> 13:04.253
Yeah.

13:06.432 --> 13:09.732
- Go for Granger.
- Well, nice to see a familiar face.

13:09.903 --> 13:12.395
Likewise.
Granger didn't tell me you were here.

13:12.572 --> 13:14.172
- I'm not.
- You're not. Of course. Yeah.

13:14.340 --> 13:15.774
Neither am I.

13:16.175 --> 13:18.473
- Is that coffee?
- Some form of it.

13:18.645 --> 13:20.113
Thank God.

13:22.115 --> 13:23.913
So how long have you been here?

13:24.083 --> 13:29.385
Uh, almost three months,
but feels like three years.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.915
Thought you got called back
to Washington to head the search

13:32.058 --> 13:33.253
for Sidorov's nukes.

13:33.426 --> 13:36.418
I was,
but they pulled me back for this.

13:36.596 --> 13:38.860
This was more important
than three stolen nukes?

13:40.033 --> 13:41.933
Well, you know Washington, right?

13:44.737 --> 13:47.604
- Nice work, by the way.
- Thanks.

13:47.774 --> 13:50.539
Yeah. I would've liked
to have gotten a shot

13:50.710 --> 13:54.476
at the guy who killed Snyder myself,
but glad you got him.

13:55.348 --> 13:57.646
Yeah. I heard two of your guys
got pretty messed up.

13:58.051 --> 13:59.917
Yeah, but thankfully, they're okay.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.612
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

14:03.823 --> 14:06.588
I've been humping through the Kush
for three freaking weeks.

14:06.759 --> 14:09.490
If I have to eat another rodent,
I think I'm gonna die.

14:10.530 --> 14:12.123
So, what's your part in all this?

14:12.298 --> 14:14.995
I was brought in as a shooter
for the Spin Pairay,

14:15.168 --> 14:16.636
White Ghost guy.

14:20.273 --> 14:23.607
- What?
- Nothing.

14:24.444 --> 14:26.503
You don't think
I have the sniper skills?

14:26.679 --> 14:29.580
- Do you?
- Would I be here if I didn't?

14:31.551 --> 14:34.316
Granger didn't tell you what happened
to our last shooter?

14:34.554 --> 14:35.988
No.

14:36.322 --> 14:39.758
The guy you're replacing,
Sanders, he was SOG too.

14:39.926 --> 14:41.758
He came over with me.

14:42.261 --> 14:43.592
He got caught by the mu;J.

14:44.130 --> 14:45.495
I found his body.

14:46.265 --> 14:48.290
I never found his head.

14:59.946 --> 15:04.975
So, what do these QRF guys
look like, anyway?

15:05.785 --> 15:07.583
- What do you mean?
- I mean, are they, like,

15:07.754 --> 15:09.552
total long-haired
WOD-crushing Hemsworths

15:09.722 --> 15:12.123
or, like, wiry, cerebral Goslings?

15:12.291 --> 15:14.316
I'm not sure I even know
what those words mean.

15:14.727 --> 15:15.819
Are those people?

15:16.596 --> 15:17.791
Really?

15:21.234 --> 15:22.463
G, window.

15:23.102 --> 15:24.592
Get in there.

15:35.515 --> 15:37.381
Take them alive!

16:06.846 --> 16:08.109
He's gone.

16:08.781 --> 16:10.141
What happened
to taking them alive?

16:10.783 --> 16:12.342
Your guy's alive, but he escaped.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.180
- Is that some kind of big win?
- He's clean.

16:16.556 --> 16:18.524
Check out the Iowa Boots.

16:18.691 --> 16:21.126
Chinese PLA hiring mercs
out of Europe now?

16:21.294 --> 16:22.455
Maybe.

16:22.628 --> 16:29.193
Um, the guy that attacked me,
he had a scar on his neck like that.

16:37.343 --> 16:38.538
We need to move.

16:39.011 --> 16:41.378
I'll send it over to Ops. Let's go.

16:51.491 --> 16:54.984
The shooter's car didn't have plates
but Callen sent this in.

16:55.161 --> 16:57.721
Doesn't look like Chinese PLA
to me.

16:58.297 --> 17:01.062
- I'll run him through facial rec.
- What a good idea.

17:08.374 --> 17:09.465
Cover. Move it.

17:16.115 --> 17:19.346
That SUV,
it's the second time I've seen it.

17:20.219 --> 17:21.617
He can't see us.

17:23.055 --> 17:24.079
They're tracking us.

17:25.324 --> 17:27.486
- You have a phone?
- No. It's at home.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.788
Do you remember
the whole crazy assassin thing? Oh.

17:29.962 --> 17:31.487
Oh, okay, that is happening. What...?

17:31.664 --> 17:33.632
You said you fought the guy
at your house.

17:33.966 --> 17:35.646
He could have put a tracking device
on you.

17:35.801 --> 17:36.825
- Okay.
- No.

17:37.003 --> 17:38.994
It was just getting fun.

17:39.172 --> 17:40.606
It's got to be our phones.

17:41.073 --> 17:44.134
They're using Stingrays. They could've
pinged our phones during the ambush.

17:44.911 --> 17:46.504
Let's send them on their way.

17:51.617 --> 17:53.016
Sam?

18:00.493 --> 18:01.790
What?

18:03.162 --> 18:05.597
G, give me your phone.

18:05.765 --> 18:09.668
Phones and plastic? What is phones
in a plastic bag? That makes a bomb?

18:10.937 --> 18:12.427
Stay back.

18:13.272 --> 18:15.536
Phone bomb. Oh, nice.

18:32.525 --> 18:34.425
On its way to San Pedro.

18:40.900 --> 18:43.528
That worked. That actually worked.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.330
He's leaving.

18:45.504 --> 18:47.438
Don't sound so surprised.

18:47.607 --> 18:50.508
Okay, so, what do we do now? Do we
flag down the police or steal a car?

18:50.676 --> 18:53.543
No, no. We do that,
we show up on the police scanner,

18:53.713 --> 18:54.908
and they'll be listening.

18:55.081 --> 18:56.571
We'd be leading them right to us.

18:56.749 --> 18:58.808
Look, we're dark now, okay?

18:58.985 --> 19:01.215
We can't call our team,
but we also can't be traced.

19:01.387 --> 19:03.617
On foot and anonymous
is the safest way.

19:03.789 --> 19:05.188
We're gonna get you out of this.

19:05.358 --> 19:07.486
That seems very vague.
"Get me out of this."

19:07.660 --> 19:10.220
- Could mean a lot of different things.
- I need you to trust us.

19:11.998 --> 19:15.059
G, let's move.

19:30.048 --> 19:31.641
Any luck, Mr. Beale?

19:31.817 --> 19:34.718
Callen and Sam ditched their phones
in the city drainage system,

19:34.887 --> 19:37.686
but after that,
it's like they just disappeared.

19:37.856 --> 19:39.381
That's good. That's what they do.

19:39.558 --> 19:41.993
Got a hit from Interpol
on the picture Callen sent.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.753
All right, Malik Terzik.

19:43.929 --> 19:46.057
He's a Bosnian national
with suspected ties

19:46.231 --> 19:48.996
to an Eastern European
paramilitary group called Roda.

19:49.167 --> 19:50.692
Bosnian merc.

19:50.869 --> 19:53.702
How's a guy like this connected
to Senator Lockhart and his daughter?

19:53.872 --> 19:56.341
That's what you need to find out.

19:56.508 --> 19:58.533
Where's Nell when you need her?

19:59.611 --> 20:02.080
Not that I need Nell.

20:02.581 --> 20:04.982
You know,
it'd just be nice to have her...

20:05.150 --> 20:07.346
Ahem. No. Never mind.

20:07.519 --> 20:11.547
Nell's out in the field because Kensi's
on a super-important mission. I get it.

20:13.025 --> 20:17.326
Kensi is on an important mission,
right?

20:23.568 --> 20:25.969
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Tell you what?

20:26.138 --> 20:28.698
- About the shooter I'm replacing.
- I wasn't.

20:28.874 --> 20:30.933
- Why?
- It's not relevant to your mission.

20:31.109 --> 20:33.237
It's not relevant to my mission?

20:33.412 --> 20:35.642
I'm here because the guy before me
was decapitated.

20:35.814 --> 20:37.213
Sabatino told me what happened.

20:39.618 --> 20:40.710
So now you know.

20:40.886 --> 20:43.355
But why weren't you going
to tell me?

20:43.522 --> 20:46.287
You think I couldn't handle it
or you think I'd get spooked? What?

20:46.458 --> 20:49.393
I figured you knew this is a war zone,
Blye, and I assumed as such,

20:49.561 --> 20:51.723
you realized our enemies
weren't gonna treat us

20:51.897 --> 20:53.729
to afternoon tea if we got captured.

20:53.899 --> 20:57.164
So, yeah, your predecessor
got his head chopped off.

20:57.336 --> 20:59.566
But I would hope
you wouldn't need to be told that

20:59.738 --> 21:02.764
in order to avoid having the same thing
happen to you.

21:02.941 --> 21:04.670
Now, we've got intel to gather.

21:04.843 --> 21:06.470
Let's go.

21:22.327 --> 21:23.954
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm peachy.

21:24.129 --> 21:25.153
You coming with us?

21:25.797 --> 21:27.697
No, I just got back.

21:27.866 --> 21:29.356
Besides, I work alone.

21:29.534 --> 21:30.865
Nothing personal.

21:31.636 --> 21:32.660
Right.

21:33.472 --> 21:35.804
Maybe we could do something
together when you get back.

21:36.608 --> 21:37.632
Like what?

21:37.809 --> 21:39.937
I don't know.
I'm sure we can think of something.

21:41.646 --> 21:43.444
Maybe we could rent a camel
and go clubbing.

21:44.049 --> 21:45.676
Yeah, okay.

21:50.122 --> 21:52.784
I used to drive by those and think,
"Big trash can."

21:52.958 --> 21:55.893
Now I think,
"Warm cocoon of safety.”

21:59.398 --> 22:00.695
Two rounds.

22:00.866 --> 22:02.027
- I'm dry.
- Wait.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.463
We only have two bullets left?

22:04.002 --> 22:05.868
I got two bullets.
You got your fists.

22:06.038 --> 22:08.405
Oh, my God, two bullets.
Two bullets, two bullets.

22:08.573 --> 22:11.702
Look, saying it over and over again is
not gonna make it three bullets, okay?

22:11.877 --> 22:14.778
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

22:14.946 --> 22:17.066
There's nothing to smile about.
We are not having fun.

22:17.215 --> 22:18.580
We are barely surviving.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.980
You can't barely survive.
Either you do or you don't.

22:21.153 --> 22:22.450
And we're still here, all right?

22:22.621 --> 22:24.521
We only have two bullets left.

22:24.689 --> 22:26.214
I might be able to fix that.

22:30.695 --> 22:32.993
So this is the last place
Eric pinged their phones.

22:33.165 --> 22:34.445
There's gotta be something here.

22:34.599 --> 22:36.829
Sam and Callen
are being hunted down like wild boar,

22:37.002 --> 22:38.265
and we can't even find them.

22:38.437 --> 22:40.371
I kind of feel bad for the guys
hunting them.

22:40.539 --> 22:41.563
Oh, I got it.

22:41.740 --> 22:43.208
- What's that?
- They went that way.

22:43.375 --> 22:45.605
- And how do you know?
- They gotta match the baseline.

22:45.777 --> 22:47.472
Behind this is a bunch of bankers
in suits.

22:47.646 --> 22:49.080
They might as well wear neon signs.

22:49.247 --> 22:52.114
But this way, jeans and Henleys
all day long, baby.

22:52.284 --> 22:53.445
The baseline, huh?

22:53.618 --> 22:57.248
Last spring, Kensi used her vacation
days to go to this urban tracking class.

22:57.722 --> 23:00.851
Couldn't stop talking about baseline.
It's a big part of urban tracking.

23:01.026 --> 23:03.961
- Mm. Go, Kens.
- Honestly, who does that for fun?

23:04.129 --> 23:06.564
If you give me a week's vacation,
I'm going to the beach.

23:06.731 --> 23:08.790
I don't care if it's left or right coast
or Hawaii,

23:08.967 --> 23:10.992
but there's gotta be sand,
there's gotta be surf,

23:11.169 --> 23:13.160
and there's definitely gotta be ladies
in bikinis.

23:13.338 --> 23:15.864
- I know where they're going.
- Yeah, but the beach is too far.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.942
I don't know exactly where they're
going, but I know what they need.

23:19.344 --> 23:20.539
Are you playing Password?

23:21.046 --> 23:23.246
Between the attack on the Mercedes
and in the warehouse,

23:23.381 --> 23:24.941
Callen and Sam
are probably out of ammo.

23:25.117 --> 23:28.087
So you think they're at Walmart?

23:28.253 --> 23:31.883
I heard a rumor that the Agency
sets up caches in major cities

23:32.057 --> 23:34.492
for food, supplies, ammo.

23:34.659 --> 23:37.890
You heard a rumor
about a super-secret CIA cache?

23:38.063 --> 23:39.360
Okay, so I didn't hear a rumor.

23:39.531 --> 23:41.251
Maybe I read something
I wasn't supposed to.

23:41.399 --> 23:43.629
- Okay.
- Either way, if they're out of ammo,

23:43.802 --> 23:45.402
Callen would know
where these caches are.

23:45.570 --> 23:46.799
Okay, so where are they?

23:46.972 --> 23:49.031
That's the part that was redacted.

23:49.207 --> 23:51.676
- Does Hetty know?
- Mm. Not likely.

23:51.843 --> 23:54.540
The system I read about is strictly
need-to-know for field agents.

23:54.713 --> 23:56.203
- So, what do you think?
- Uh...

23:56.381 --> 23:57.701
- Follow the baseline?
- Baseline.

23:57.849 --> 23:58.941
Yeah.

23:59.618 --> 24:04.920
Miss Lange, I've been making some
calls, but I don't know what to do.

24:05.090 --> 24:07.320
Senator, I don't have a daughter

24:07.492 --> 24:09.620
and I can't imagine
what you're going through.

24:09.794 --> 24:12.764
I will not disrespect you
by pretending that I do.

24:12.931 --> 24:14.592
But I do want to say

24:14.766 --> 24:21.035
that Lily could not be under the watch
of two more qualified or driven men

24:21.206 --> 24:23.038
than Agents Callen and Hanna.

24:23.208 --> 24:25.609
They will bring Lily home.

24:26.411 --> 24:27.776
Thank you, Henrietta.

24:27.946 --> 24:29.141
Of course.

24:30.182 --> 24:33.152
This is Malik Terzik.

24:33.318 --> 24:35.548
He's a Bosnian mercenary.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.415
This is one of the men after Lily?

24:37.589 --> 24:39.785
Yes, he was. He's dead now.

24:42.661 --> 24:43.856
I don't know him.

24:45.397 --> 24:47.525
Well, we're investigating
his finances

24:47.699 --> 24:49.963
to see if the Chinese
could have hired him.

24:50.402 --> 24:53.201
I did a lot of work in Bosnia.

24:53.371 --> 24:54.839
Yes, I know you did.

24:55.006 --> 24:58.067
We're looking into that as well.

24:59.077 --> 25:04.015
The way you speak of Agents
Callen and Hanna, the respect,

25:04.182 --> 25:06.378
people used to speak about my unit
that way.

25:06.551 --> 25:07.575
Yes, they did.

25:07.752 --> 25:11.518
And now, when it matters most,
with Lily out there and scared,

25:12.257 --> 25:14.521
I gotta sit here on the sidelines.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.824
You know what they say about aging,
senator.

25:19.798 --> 25:21.698
It ain't for bitches.

25:28.607 --> 25:30.439
- Yeah.
- There's the cache.

25:30.976 --> 25:32.774
- That electrical thing?
- Yep.

25:33.311 --> 25:34.745
Hidden in plain sight.

25:34.913 --> 25:37.848
Okay, how do we get those guys out
of there, so we can get to the bullets?

25:38.016 --> 25:39.976
You're up, Sam.
I can't do everything around here.

25:40.118 --> 25:42.416
Everything?
What planet do you live on?

25:42.587 --> 25:43.782
Planet Reality, brother.

25:43.955 --> 25:46.219
- Come on in, the water's warm.
- Okay, guys...

25:46.391 --> 25:48.431
I can't even tell you
how many times I've covered...

25:48.593 --> 25:50.891
Covered for me?
Oh, now you're covering for me?

25:51.062 --> 25:53.622
Guys, what is the plan?

25:55.166 --> 25:56.827
Boss ride-along.

25:57.002 --> 25:58.163
- Fine.
- What?

25:58.336 --> 25:59.997
- Wait here.
- Wait here.

26:14.552 --> 26:16.884
- This how you run your territory?
- Definitely not, sir.

26:17.055 --> 26:19.080
- Can I help you guys?
- I hope so.

26:19.758 --> 26:21.988
- Who are you?
- I'm District Manager Stevens.

26:22.160 --> 26:25.130
- District what?
- Newly appointed district manager.

26:25.297 --> 26:27.288
Just let me talk to my guy, please.

26:27.465 --> 26:28.830
Okay?

26:29.467 --> 26:33.426
Look, I'm gonna be buying you a beer
and probably a pitcher.

26:33.605 --> 26:35.565
Strike that.
I'll be buying all you guys pitchers.

26:35.707 --> 26:37.971
Oh, all right. So, what's going on?

26:38.143 --> 26:41.340
I was supposed to move you to a water
main situation on Figueroa, I didn't.

26:41.513 --> 26:43.174
It's my bad, but here's the deal.

26:43.348 --> 26:47.649
Today's my first day,
and the boss decided to ride along.

26:49.654 --> 26:51.179
I'm hurting here.

26:52.157 --> 26:53.625
We got your back.

26:54.859 --> 26:55.985
All right, let's move.

26:56.161 --> 26:58.061
Gotta be down on Figueroa
ten minutes ago.

26:58.229 --> 26:59.458
Thank you.

27:36.634 --> 27:38.966
Did I ever tell you I love spies?

28:05.729 --> 28:06.753
Let's roll.

28:06.930 --> 28:08.193
No, thanks.

28:08.365 --> 28:09.890
You gotta hydrate.

28:10.067 --> 28:11.228
A one-time-use plastic?

28:11.401 --> 28:13.961
Are you crazy? Haven't you ever heard
of the North Pacific Gyre?

28:14.137 --> 28:16.231
- Nope.
- You're gonna now.

28:16.406 --> 28:18.431
It's a bunch of plastic
twice the size of Texas

28:18.609 --> 28:20.600
floating in the middle of the ocean.
It's gross.

28:20.777 --> 28:21.938
All right, no plastic.

28:22.112 --> 28:23.511
How about food?

28:23.680 --> 28:26.547
Unidentifiable man-made sludge?
No, thanks.

28:26.717 --> 28:28.651
- So you'd rather starve?
- I eat correctly.

28:28.819 --> 28:30.378
I can go days without food.

28:30.687 --> 28:34.089
- You buying this?
- Macronutrients, G. Look it up.

28:36.293 --> 28:39.422
Deeks, it's Sam. We're back online.
We're gonna need your help.

28:39.596 --> 28:41.997
I'm sorry. Why are we going back
towards the bad guys?

28:42.165 --> 28:45.066
They lost us. They'll be doing a spiral
search away from the warehouse.

28:45.235 --> 28:47.829
If we wanna end this,
we gotta find out who these guys are.

28:48.005 --> 28:49.700
Deeks, tell Eric
to lock on this sat phone.

28:49.873 --> 28:52.604
Lily, they've been hunting us
long enough.

28:52.776 --> 28:55.336
Now it's our turn. You good?

28:56.446 --> 28:59.677
Let's get these guys. Right.

29:30.047 --> 29:31.344
Federal agents. Drop it.

29:34.117 --> 29:35.778
Drop it.

29:38.822 --> 29:40.688
Turn around.

29:40.857 --> 29:42.757
Put your hands on your head.

29:43.694 --> 29:46.288
Thanks for the help, guys.
Good to see you.

30:02.679 --> 30:03.908
Christmas tree.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.843
Fa-la-la.

30:09.786 --> 30:11.379
Grinch.

30:21.064 --> 30:22.498
The elves have been busy.

30:22.666 --> 30:25.294
- You see that Christmas tree?
- Yeah, we did.

30:25.469 --> 30:29.303
Nice work, Sabatino. Now everybody's
reminded of how homesick they are.

30:29.473 --> 30:33.933
- Oh, my God, that smells delicious.
- And just in time for dinner.

30:34.111 --> 30:35.806
Wait, did you make this?

30:36.146 --> 30:37.614
Not just a pretty face.

30:37.781 --> 30:40.409
Oh, and we got mail too.
I left it on your racks.

30:40.584 --> 30:43.019
Awesome. I'm gonna go wash up.

30:45.756 --> 30:47.383
It's not turkey, is it?

30:48.291 --> 30:51.420
Bearded vulture,
but it tastes just like turkey.

30:52.429 --> 30:54.397
I'm gonna take your word for it.

31:16.119 --> 31:17.416
Thank you.

31:20.490 --> 31:22.618
- What do you have, Sam?
- This guy's not talking.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.228
He's probably afraid of Ludomir Susic,
the head of Roda.

31:25.395 --> 31:27.523
Susic's run Roda for years,

31:27.697 --> 31:30.792
but he's never surfaced in America
till now.

31:30.967 --> 31:33.834
Facial rec caught him
going through LAX.

31:34.004 --> 31:36.405
Well, whatever he's here for
is worth the risk to him.

31:36.573 --> 31:39.565
The guy you picked up
may not be talking, but his phone is.

31:39.743 --> 31:42.144
He's only called or received calls
from one number.

31:42.312 --> 31:43.336
It's a prepaid.

31:43.513 --> 31:44.571
Susic's phone.

31:44.748 --> 31:46.341
You got a location on that prepaid?

31:46.516 --> 31:48.541
Triangulating now.

31:49.686 --> 31:52.366
Capitol Police just called.
The senator ditched his security detail.

31:52.522 --> 31:53.546
He's in the wind.

31:53.723 --> 31:57.023
He didn't run
until after he knew Lily was safe.

31:58.061 --> 32:00.496
Guys, I just got an alert from the IRS.

32:00.664 --> 32:02.496
Senator Lockhart
received a wire transfer

32:02.666 --> 32:06.034
to a bank in Singapore yesterday:
$200,000.

32:07.637 --> 32:09.264
We could be looking at this wrong.

32:09.439 --> 32:11.999
What if the senator and Susic
are working together?

32:12.175 --> 32:14.337
If they are, why go after Lily?

32:14.511 --> 32:16.001
If the senator and Susic had deal

32:16.179 --> 32:18.379
and the senator got cold feet
after he was already paid,

32:18.548 --> 32:19.628
Susic's not gonna be happy.

32:19.783 --> 32:22.878
He'd wanna motivate the senator
to complete the deal.

32:23.053 --> 32:24.646
Going after Lily does that.

32:24.821 --> 32:27.449
Guys, I think I know
where the senator's going.

32:28.225 --> 32:30.427
- Susic's phone's at Pershing Square.
- Go.

33:02.892 --> 33:05.327
- Deeks, you got eyes on Susic?
- Negative.

33:05.494 --> 33:07.428
I got the senator, but no Susic.

33:10.833 --> 33:14.133
Wait a minute.
I got someone approaching.

33:15.604 --> 33:17.936
Deeks, is that Susic
headed over to the senator?

33:18.107 --> 33:21.168
I can't confirm. I'm gonna get closer
for a visual confirmation.

33:23.245 --> 33:25.339
Susic's not coming here
without a spotter.

33:26.115 --> 33:27.708
Keep your eyes open.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.553
That's Susic.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.020
Sound coming in.

33:39.929 --> 33:42.023
Your daughter survived.

33:42.197 --> 33:43.528
She might be safe today,

33:43.699 --> 33:45.724
but she won't be given
24-hour protection.

33:45.901 --> 33:51.032
I can touch her in two weeks,
two months, two years,

33:51.206 --> 33:53.538
whenever I want.

33:54.677 --> 33:56.668
That's why I'm going to kill you.

33:56.845 --> 33:59.906
I expected nothing less from you
when I called.

34:00.783 --> 34:02.945
But you won't kill me
in a crowded plaza.

34:03.619 --> 34:05.109
You don't know me.

34:05.287 --> 34:08.449
But it will look like
we did know each other.

34:08.623 --> 34:11.786
After you pull your gun
and my men kill you,

34:11.960 --> 34:14.225
the U.S. will find an account
with your name on it.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.592
An account that I funded.

34:17.766 --> 34:22.067
You will be branded a traitor
and I will still kill your daughter.

34:23.605 --> 34:24.731
Susic's got men here.

34:24.907 --> 34:26.841
We gotta get eyes on them
before we move in.

34:27.009 --> 34:29.341
Why are you doing this?

34:29.511 --> 34:31.239
What do you want from me?

34:31.679 --> 34:34.114
Do you remember Grbavica?

34:35.050 --> 34:36.484
In 1994,

34:36.652 --> 34:40.610
the unit you commanded
murdered a man they called Vuk.

34:41.523 --> 34:42.752
A great man.

34:43.692 --> 34:45.592
A great man?

34:46.862 --> 34:48.420
He was a warlord.

34:48.597 --> 34:52.090
- He killed innocent people in his own...
- He was my father.

34:57.172 --> 34:58.469
Got eyes on the spotter.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.904
Gray jean jacket.
He's been watching the senator.

35:01.076 --> 35:03.272
I think he's got a gun.

35:03.445 --> 35:05.004
There's at least one more.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.443
This is about revenge.

35:06.615 --> 35:08.947
Take Susic, I'll find the other spotter.

35:10.085 --> 35:12.349
Deeks, you get the senator.
Nell, take out the spotter.

35:12.521 --> 35:13.852
Yep.

35:17.226 --> 35:18.318
You move, I shoot.

35:20.696 --> 35:22.494
Senator, move.

35:22.664 --> 35:23.961
- Go, go, go.
- Unh.

35:26.268 --> 35:27.895
Everybody down! Down!

35:37.880 --> 35:40.315
- Sitrep?
- I'm good!

35:40.716 --> 35:42.047
Senator's secure.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.077
Shooter down and detained.

35:53.162 --> 35:54.994
We're good, thanks.

35:56.131 --> 35:57.565
Dad.

36:04.006 --> 36:05.098
I love you.

36:06.542 --> 36:08.806
I love you too.

36:11.380 --> 36:13.576
Someone else wanted to see you.

36:14.183 --> 36:18.518
Bubba. Oh, hi, baby.

36:18.687 --> 36:20.587
Hi, my love. Hi.

36:21.857 --> 36:23.916
Thank you, gentlemen,
for watching over Lily today.

36:24.093 --> 36:26.255
- You went above and beyond.
- You're welcome.

36:26.428 --> 36:28.788
Well, from the stories I've heard,
you'd have done the same.

36:28.931 --> 36:30.695
I owe you gentlemen a debt.

36:30.866 --> 36:32.265
It will be repaid.

36:32.434 --> 36:34.402
There's the tough guy back
from the vet.

36:35.771 --> 36:37.811
I think we've earned ourselves
a cold beer, partner.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.908
- Or six.
- Heh.

36:40.509 --> 36:43.206
Hey, what about me?

36:43.378 --> 36:45.972
You've earned yourself a job
cooking us a slow-food dinner.

36:46.148 --> 36:48.378
Yes. That I can do.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.578
Thank you.

36:52.754 --> 36:54.813
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

37:01.530 --> 37:03.589
That's a boy. That's a good boy.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.392
- Attaboy.
- Yeah.

37:06.034 --> 37:08.025
- That doesn't smell right.
- Move it.

37:08.203 --> 37:09.923
- It smells like a hobo.
- Get out of there.

37:10.072 --> 37:12.905
Mm. Wow, that is a lot of brandy.

37:13.075 --> 37:15.840
I don't think you can even technically
call it eggnog at this point.

37:16.011 --> 37:17.979
Pull up your skirt and drink.

37:18.147 --> 37:20.115
Oh, wow, well-played.

37:20.282 --> 37:22.979
Now, look,
I know it's gonna take me a while

37:23.152 --> 37:25.018
and I'll probably never get
to Kensi's level...

37:25.187 --> 37:26.712
- Not without a booster seat.
- Wow.

37:26.889 --> 37:28.118
No, I'm kidding.

37:28.290 --> 37:30.691
You did great today.

37:30.859 --> 37:31.917
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:32.094 --> 37:33.687
- You did.
- Thank you.

37:33.862 --> 37:35.762
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

37:35.931 --> 37:37.399
Thanks.

37:38.433 --> 37:40.663
Mm. Okay.

37:41.336 --> 37:42.667
Mr. Callen.

37:43.906 --> 37:45.499
Keeping Nell out in the field?

37:46.008 --> 37:49.103
Nell has a job up in Ops,
you remember?

37:50.512 --> 37:53.379
You wouldn't be grooming her
for any specific job, would you?

37:54.149 --> 37:57.449
Whose job would that be?

38:04.359 --> 38:05.554
- How is that?
- Ooh.

38:05.727 --> 38:07.487
- It's gonna change your life.
- Here you go.

38:07.629 --> 38:09.097
- There you go.
- It's that good.

38:09.264 --> 38:11.323
- A little eggnog...
- I gotta tell you,

38:11.500 --> 38:13.764
the proportion of eggnog
to brandy in this, perfect.

38:13.936 --> 38:15.216
Most people, they water it down.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.464
- Yeah?
- Yeah. It's perfect, it's delicious.

38:17.639 --> 38:18.663
Thanks.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.172
I was saying the same thing
to her about how good it was.

38:21.343 --> 38:23.072
A strong batch, Nell.

38:26.448 --> 38:29.179
Guys, to Kensi.

38:30.586 --> 38:32.554
- To Kensi.
- Kensi.

38:32.721 --> 38:33.882
Kensi.

38:54.176 --> 38:56.042
Christmas cake.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.771
Hetty, you are a terrible re-gifter.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.587
Of course.

39:31.380 --> 39:33.144
I see you got my present.

39:33.949 --> 39:36.077
I certainly did. Thank you.

39:36.251 --> 39:37.810
This is a secure line.

39:37.986 --> 39:41.684
No one else has this number
or the one you're calling.

39:41.857 --> 39:44.827
Do not let this phone
out of your sight.

39:44.993 --> 39:47.462
It's your only true lifeline.

39:47.629 --> 39:48.892
I won't.

39:50.265 --> 39:52.427
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

39:52.601 --> 39:55.070
Bone china is fine.

39:55.237 --> 39:57.729
You are not bone china.

39:58.073 --> 39:59.563
I'm doing very well.

39:59.741 --> 40:02.836
Uh-huh. What's your assessment
of the task force?

40:03.011 --> 40:04.501
They're okay.

40:04.680 --> 40:09.140
I think the mountain air
must have limited your vocabulary.

40:09.718 --> 40:14.485
They seem competent, but withdrawn.
They're not the friendliest bunch.

40:14.956 --> 40:16.981
Anyone in particular stand out
to you?

40:17.492 --> 40:19.586
- How so?
- An outlier?

40:19.761 --> 40:23.698
Someone who doesn't seem
to get along with the others?

40:23.865 --> 40:28.302
Um, someone who could,
perchance, be a traitor.

40:29.137 --> 40:30.161
You think there's a leak?

40:30.339 --> 40:33.536
Well, I think the insurgents
are doing an uncanny job

40:33.709 --> 40:37.509
of avoiding our best efforts
at tracking them.

40:37.679 --> 40:40.705
- What do you want me to do?
- Smoke them out.

40:40.882 --> 40:45.319
Give them each a variation
of some disinformation,

40:45.487 --> 40:47.046
in confidence.

40:47.222 --> 40:48.690
See who bites first.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.454
And if they do?

40:51.193 --> 40:53.093
Make it stop.

40:53.261 --> 40:54.387
And be careful.

40:55.063 --> 40:56.189
Always.

40:56.365 --> 41:00.165
Oh, there's another number
stored on your phone.

41:00.335 --> 41:02.895
It, too, is a secure line.

41:03.071 --> 41:04.232
Merry Christmas.

41:04.406 --> 41:05.567
Oh, thanks, Hetty. Who...?

41:09.044 --> 41:12.173
And a real famous cat
All dressed up in red.

41:12.347 --> 41:15.009
And he spends the whole year
Working out on his sled.

41:15.183 --> 41:16.947
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

41:17.119 --> 41:18.712
- Mr. Deeks.
- Huh? Ooh.

41:18.887 --> 41:20.377
Sorry, was that too awesome?

41:20.555 --> 41:22.887
Because I can...
I can turn it down a notch.

41:23.058 --> 41:25.789
Check your desk drawer.

41:25.961 --> 41:27.588
I left you a little present.

41:31.199 --> 41:32.860
Thank you, Hetty.

41:33.402 --> 41:36.702
And, uh, Merry Christmas.

41:38.073 --> 41:40.770
Merry Christmas, Mr. Deeks.

41:41.109 --> 41:43.771
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick.

41:44.379 --> 41:46.541
Happy birthday. Merry Christmas.

41:46.715 --> 41:48.706
Ho-ho-ho.

41:50.519 --> 41:51.714
Or it's a bomb.

41:52.454 --> 41:56.288
That's ringing a lot like a phone.
A sat phone.

41:56.458 --> 41:58.756
Ha! Go for Santa.

42:00.095 --> 42:01.654
Deeks?

42:03.398 --> 42:04.797
Ken... Kensi?

42:05.400 --> 42:08.392
Hey, how did you...?
How did you get...? It doesn't matter.

42:08.570 --> 42:11.039
How...? My God, how are you?

42:14.209 --> 42:16.303
Um, yeah. I'm good.

42:17.312 --> 42:18.871
How are you?

42:20.849 --> 42:22.317
I'm good, you know.

42:22.484 --> 42:25.784
I'm strong to moderately...
I'm moderately strong.

42:25.954 --> 42:27.547
I'm good.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.246
I miss you guys.

42:29.691 --> 42:35.152
Yeah, no, me and, uh, the guys,
we miss you too, partner.

42:35.330 --> 42:38.322
And Monty misses you.
It's kind of awkward.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.629
He just mopes around the house
listening to Tori Amos all day.

42:42.704 --> 42:44.365
You got any plans?

42:44.539 --> 42:47.907
Yeah, no, we got big plans.
Big plans for the holidays.

42:48.076 --> 42:52.172
Monty made a pot roast in
the Crock-Pot, so we're gonna...

42:52.347 --> 42:55.214
We're gonna eat that and hang out.
What about you? You have any plans?

42:55.383 --> 42:58.614
Oh, you know, me and the guys,
we're going clubbing tonight.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.610
Good, because I hear good things

43:00.789 --> 43:02.229
about the discotheque in Hindu Kush.
