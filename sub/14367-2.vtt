you'll make

What for?

10:24.665 --> 10:27.626
{\an1}Afraid that information's
classified.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.379
No holes,
no candy residue

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
no penciled-on
mustaches

10:31.964 --> 10:34.967
{\an5}or it comes out of
your allowance...
no kidding.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.635
{\an1}We have reached
an understanding!

10:38.304 --> 10:39.347
{\an1}Pleasure doing business
with you, Mom.

10:39.430 --> 10:43.184
{\an1}Oh, uh...
one more favor?

10:43.267 --> 10:44.226
{\an1}I'd like to have
my lady-friend

10:44.310 --> 10:46.437
{\an1}over for dinner
tomorrow

10:46.520 --> 10:47.271
if it pleases
the committee.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.732
{\an1}Things are
getting serious.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.359
{\an1}I want everyone
to meet her.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.862
Well, I am
speechless.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.072
So it's okay?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.366
I don't see why not.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.993
Tomorrow's line-up
is really heating up.

11:03.788 --> 11:04.997
Checkmate!

11:05.081 --> 11:07.625
(<i> general conversation...</i> )

11:07.708 --> 11:08.834
(<i> ducks quacking</i> )

11:08.918 --> 11:10.211
(<i> wheelchair rattling</i> )

11:10.294 --> 11:12.630
(<i> woman screams</i> )

11:17.510 --> 11:22.890
(<i> all exclaiming</i> )

11:22.973 --> 11:24.809
(<i> quacking</i> )

11:24.892 --> 11:26.352
(<i> both laughing</i> )

11:26.435 --> 11:28.771
Wasn't that great,
Hoods?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.064
Did you see it?

11:30.147 --> 11:33.734
{\an1}If you ask me, the whole thing's
a little juvenile.

11:33.818 --> 11:34.110
Juvenile? Are you nuts?

11:34.193 --> 11:36.070
Come on, Hoods!

11:36.153 --> 11:37.613
Surely you can
appreciate...

11:37.697 --> 11:38.531
And another thing, Carl!

11:38.614 --> 11:42.451
{\an1}Why did you change
the secret hiding place

11:42.535 --> 11:45.454
for the doghouse key
without telling me?!

11:45.538 --> 11:48.457
Oh, don't get your
undies in a bunch!

11:48.541 --> 11:52.461
{\an1}It's buried in a pickle jar
behind the dying shrub.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.963
{\an1}<i>She</i> knows?

11:54.046 --> 11:58.134
{\an1}She knows the secret
hiding place before me?

11:58.217 --> 12:01.512
{\an1}(<i> wheezing</i> ):
Oh, this is rich, Carl!

12:01.595 --> 12:02.638
Really rich!

12:02.721 --> 12:04.598
I could have sworn
I told you...

12:04.682 --> 12:05.724
(<i> burps</i> )

12:05.808 --> 12:08.227
Now, for the finishing touch.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.814
Macie, hit the light.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.816
(<i> disco music playing...</i> )

12:13.899 --> 12:17.361
It's a disco-inspired
wonderland!

12:17.445 --> 12:21.574
{\an1}I pronounce this bedroom
a virtual den of coolness.

12:21.657 --> 12:22.658
Oh, thanks, you guys.

12:22.741 --> 12:26.829
Do you think I should
hide my ponies?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.292
What do you think
of this top, Miranda?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.294
I'm looking for something
that says

12:33.377 --> 12:37.423
{\an5}"I don't want to look
like I'm better than you...
but I kind of am."

12:37.506 --> 12:38.549
What do you think?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.801
{\an1}I bet her room is
filled with pony toys!

12:40.885 --> 12:42.511
{\an1}She probably has
a mobile, too!

12:42.595 --> 12:44.180
Miranda!
I'm talking to you!

12:44.263 --> 12:45.556
There will be
plenty of time

12:45.639 --> 12:47.183
for you to talk
to yourself

12:47.266 --> 12:49.059
while I'm
at my dinner engagement.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.853
Now, what do you think
of my top?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.355
{\an1}It's perfect, Courtney.
Really.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.900
{\an1}Just the right shade
of green.

12:55.983 --> 12:58.652
{\an5}Dodie:
Okay, let's move on
to the living room!

13:07.453 --> 13:09.830
Strike the potty shot,
for sure.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.753
Check!

13:15.836 --> 13:16.795
{\an1}Conceal

13:16.879 --> 13:18.255
{\an1}the apple
brown betty stain.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.548
(<i> all grunt</i> )

13:19.632 --> 13:20.508
Check!

13:20.591 --> 13:21.550
{\an3}There--

13:21.634 --> 13:22.885
{\an5}totally
and utterly
acceptable.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.349
Lois:
Nice looking table, kiddo.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.226
But we're one place short.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.519
What?

13:31.602 --> 13:33.312
I say we're one short.

13:33.395 --> 13:35.564
Carl's got company
coming, too.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.941
Didn't I tell you?

13:37.024 --> 13:39.026
He has a little
girlfriend.

13:39.109 --> 13:39.568
Isn't that sweet?

13:39.652 --> 13:42.863
{\an1}Sweet?!
Are you serious?

13:42.947 --> 13:43.906
{\an1}Mother!

13:43.989 --> 13:46.575
{\an1}Courtney Gripling
is coming to our house

13:46.659 --> 13:47.910
for dinner tonight.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.578
{\an1}How, I repeat,<i> how,</i>
could you possibly let Carl

13:49.662 --> 13:53.582
invite one of his
grimy little playmates?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.002
{\an1}This is Courtney Gripling
we're talking about!

13:57.086 --> 13:57.711
{\an1}Oh, give me a break,
Ginger.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.214
{\an1}She ain't
the Queen of England.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.466
(<i> doorbell rings</i> )

14:02.550 --> 14:04.134
Oh, please, please, please...

14:04.218 --> 14:06.637
let her be a shy,
well-mannered little girl!

14:06.720 --> 14:09.348
Preferably one with an
incredibly early curfew...

14:12.560 --> 14:13.352
Hiya, hot stuff!

14:13.435 --> 14:16.021
You must be Ginger!

14:16.105 --> 14:18.816
{\an1}But I bet your friends
call you

14:18.899 --> 14:21.777
Gingervitis! (<i> laughs</i> )

14:21.860 --> 14:24.947
That's a little gum humor for ya
since I left my teeth home.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.951
Carl said your mom's cooking
leaned toward gummy

14:29.034 --> 14:31.537
so I figured I'd go...
commando!

14:31.620 --> 14:34.415
(<i> laughing</i> )

14:34.498 --> 14:42.214
(<i> coughing...</i> )

14:42.298 --> 14:45.134
Yoo-hoo! Ginger!

14:45.217 --> 14:46.760
{\an1}Sorry I'm
fashionably late.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.764
(<i> wheezes, coughs</i> )

14:51.849 --> 14:54.643
This... is my life.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.481
(<i> glass breaks</i> )

14:59.565 --> 15:01.859
{\an1}Whoops! Did I just
break something?

15:01.942 --> 15:03.152
Oh, no, it's nothing.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.738
The cushions are just...
you know, crunchy.

15:05.821 --> 15:10.784
Look at that precious
wittle frog face.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.829
You're making a winkle!

15:13.912 --> 15:14.830
(<i> laughing</i> )

15:14.913 --> 15:18.626
{\an5}Ginger, I'd love
a walking tour
of your house...

15:18.709 --> 15:21.462
Great. Perfect. Let's go.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.672
Ah, don't worry about me.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.176
I'll be just fine here,
all by my lonesome.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.302
(<i> coughing</i> )

15:28.385 --> 15:31.013
Though it is a tad musty
in here!

15:31.096 --> 15:31.930
Maybe some fresh air...

15:35.267 --> 15:37.353
Grandma Foutley
is a real cutup!

15:37.436 --> 15:38.812
Uh, she's not my...

15:38.896 --> 15:41.857
Say, is it okay
if I lose my shoes?

15:41.940 --> 15:44.777
Since the window's
open and all?

15:44.860 --> 15:50.074
See's, I got a blistering bunion
the size of Detroit, sister

15:50.157 --> 15:53.619
and... (<i> wheezes</i> )
it needs to breathe!

15:53.702 --> 15:53.994
Shall we?

15:57.748 --> 15:59.541
Evening, ladies.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.506
So... this is my room.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.884
It's precious!
So retro!

16:08.967 --> 16:11.345
It's lived-in yet darling!

16:11.428 --> 16:13.013
The bed is tidy!

16:14.682 --> 16:15.724
The walls are adorned!

16:15.808 --> 16:20.479
And the pony motif is
absolutely priceless!

16:25.859 --> 16:29.655
Ooh! What is this, a robot?

16:30.531 --> 16:31.657
No, Courtney.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.951
That's a vacuum cleaner.

16:34.034 --> 16:36.203
It's used for cleaning.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.996
Fascinating!

16:38.080 --> 16:41.375
Ginger, there's so much
you can teach me.

16:42.835 --> 16:47.172
{\an1}So, uh... how long
have you two been, uh...

16:47.256 --> 16:48.590
Partners in crime?

16:48.674 --> 16:51.385
{\an1}Since the fateful day
I strolled into the home.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.554
That's right!

16:53.637 --> 16:55.764
{\an1}Some people said
things were moving too fast

16:55.848 --> 16:58.767
but we didn't pay them
no never mind.

16:58.851 --> 17:03.939
So, Lois...
you interested in grandchildren?

17:04.021 --> 17:05.941
What?! What, I, I... I, uh...

17:06.023 --> 17:09.778
I got to see a man about
some mushrooms, excuse me.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.071
'Cause I was gonna show
you a picture of mine!

17:16.660 --> 17:20.038
So I got this rash, right?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.707
Itches like the Dickens

17:21.790 --> 17:25.127
stubborn as a mule!
Gross...

17:25.210 --> 17:26.962
Powders don't help!

17:27.045 --> 17:28.964
Ointments won't work!

17:29.048 --> 17:31.049
Maybe just keeping
quiet about it...

17:31.133 --> 17:34.344
{\an5}Why, I even tried
an old folk remedy
that smelled like tar

17:34.428 --> 17:36.346
but it didn't make
no never mind!

17:36.430 --> 17:37.848
You're a nurse.
What gives?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.975
{\an1}Honestly?
I-I have no idea.

17:40.058 --> 17:42.853
{\an1}But I'd get it
looked at right away.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.104
(<i> gasps</i> )

17:44.188 --> 17:45.689
No!

17:45.773 --> 17:47.483
Don't worry, pumpkin!

17:47.566 --> 17:48.400
It ain't contagious.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.486
(<i> giggling</i> )

17:50.569 --> 17:52.154
She's revolting.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.074
Ain't she, though?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.201
(<i> sighs</i> )

17:57.743 --> 17:59.745
So, I made a brisket.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.832
Is that okay
for you, Courtney?

18:03.916 --> 18:04.416
(<i> giggles</i> )

18:04.500 --> 18:06.502
Oh, yes.

18:06.585 --> 18:07.753
And may I say, Mrs. Foutley

18:07.836 --> 18:11.882
you've got that whole "concerned
mother" thing down just right.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.301
Very convincing--
like the moms on TV.

18:14.384 --> 18:17.012
Hmm. You don't get out much,
do you?

18:17.096 --> 18:17.679
(<i> Courtney giggles</i> )

18:17.763 --> 18:19.056
(<i> Maude growling</i> )

18:19.139 --> 18:22.434
{\an1}Maude's got the appetite
of a wild cougar.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.519
(<i> tapping</i> )

18:23.602 --> 18:25.687
Hiya, Hoodsey!

18:25.771 --> 18:28.190
Come on in and
make yourself a plate...

18:28.273 --> 18:31.860
(<i> puffing and wheezing</i> )

18:31.944 --> 18:33.904
Please excuse me, madam.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.239
I won't be but a minute.

18:41.286 --> 18:44.248
{\an1}Okay, so what's
on your mind, Hoods?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.917
{\an1}I have tried to like Maude!
Honest I have!

18:47.000 --> 18:49.503
{\an1}But there's something about her
that I just don't trust!

18:49.586 --> 18:50.712
Hoodsey...

18:50.796 --> 18:52.089
I'm not kidding, Carl!

18:52.172 --> 18:55.509
I don't know quite
how to break this to you

18:55.592 --> 18:58.512
so I'm just going to come right
out and tell you what I think.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.889
Well?

19:00.973 --> 19:05.727
{\an1}I think she's after
one of your lungs, Carl.

19:05.811 --> 19:06.562
What?!

19:06.645 --> 19:07.312
You've heard the way

19:07.396 --> 19:09.773
{\an1}she's always hacking
her brains out!

19:09.857 --> 19:11.817
{\an1}And they say you can live
with just one!

19:11.900 --> 19:12.985
She's no fool, Carl.

19:13.068 --> 19:13.527
(<i> laughing</i> )

19:13.610 --> 19:15.737
Oh, Hoods...

19:15.821 --> 19:20.576
{\an1}You know, I think I know
what this is really about.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.243
You do?

19:21.326 --> 19:24.079
{\an1}Yep. You're jealous
of Maude.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.667
{\an1}Don't worry, Hoods, she's
never going to take your place.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.711
You're my best friend...

19:30.794 --> 19:31.879
and Maude's my woman.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.841
{\an1}Here, let me
show you something.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.761
For me?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.723
{\an1}No, but go ahead,
open it.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.728
It's a worm, Carl.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.063
It's a ringworm, Hoods!

19:50.147 --> 19:52.608
A <i> ring</i> worm?

19:52.691 --> 19:55.152
Is that Lucky Charlie?

19:55.235 --> 19:56.862
Yep, sure is!

19:56.945 --> 19:58.947
How could you?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.450
{\an1}I'm going to ask Maude
for her hand in marriage.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.660
{\an1}Tonight.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.454
You've flipped
your lid, Carl!

20:05.537 --> 20:06.914
You've lost it and
it can't be found!

20:06.997 --> 20:10.042
You're talking
crazy stuff, and I...

20:10.125 --> 20:11.877
I can't be a part of it!

20:11.960 --> 20:14.463
(<i> puffing and wheezing...</i> )

20:21.136 --> 20:23.931
Please? Pretty please?

20:24.014 --> 20:26.183
With sugar on top?

20:26.266 --> 20:30.395
{\an4}Just a few good chomps
with those pearly whites
of yours

20:30.479 --> 20:33.315
{\an1}and I can swallow
this baby down easy.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.566
Uh,<i> Grandma?</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:37.486
{\an5}You should really
try to chew your
own food.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.947
What you're doing...
it isn't polite.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.573
It isn't even sanitary.

20:41.657 --> 20:47.996
Aw, if Carl was here,
he'd chew it for me...

20:48.080 --> 20:48.914
I'm sorry, she's...

20:48.997 --> 20:52.709
On their father's side.
Really.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.586
Oh, foo!

20:54.670 --> 20:55.754
(<i> gasps</i> )

20:58.924 --> 21:01.551
Uh... Mom?

21:01.635 --> 21:03.303
Is Grandma... napping?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.266
I don't think so, Ging.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.561
Somehow, I...
I really don't think so.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.273
Poor dear...

21:22.447 --> 21:26.660
{\an1}...and her last words
were, "Oh... foo."

21:26.743 --> 21:28.495
Both:
Oh, foo...

21:28.578 --> 21:31.498
Carl's eulogy was
really touching.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.501
{\an1}I think he may have
even loved her.

21:34.584 --> 21:39.006
{\an5}This is the saddest,
most romantic story
I've ever heard.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.426
Do you think Carl's
going to be okay?

21:42.509 --> 21:43.885
{\an1}I hope so.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.721
{\an1}He's never had to deal
with anything like this.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.639
It was horrible!

21:47.723 --> 21:50.976
It was spectacular!

21:51.059 --> 21:53.395
The mother was just
like I pictured her.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.272
I touched
a real, live <i> wacuum</i>

21:55.355 --> 21:58.150
and I even got to use
my sad-for-you face!

21:58.233 --> 22:00.360
Oh, you know the one...

22:00.444 --> 22:02.112
Did you get the film back yet?

22:03.822 --> 22:05.073
(<i> laughs</i> )

22:05.157 --> 22:08.035
How did I know about the ponies?

22:08.118 --> 22:10.287
How did I know?

22:10.370 --> 22:10.537
Hi.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.581
Hi.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.249
{\an1}Got the key
from the pickle jar

22:14.332 --> 22:15.459
just like Maude said.

22:15.542 --> 22:15.751
Hope you don't mind.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.794
I don't.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.880
{\an1}I know you may not
believe me

22:19.963 --> 22:22.466
{\an1}but I'm really sorry
and everything.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.633
I believe you.

22:23.717 --> 22:25.886
Thanks, Hoods.

22:25.969 --> 22:30.265
{\an1}Pretty cool that she
left you her gallstone.

22:30.348 --> 22:31.433
Only Maude...

22:31.516 --> 22:37.022
{\an1}Hey, Carl? You want to go throw
water balloons off your roof?

22:37.105 --> 22:40.108
You know... I think
it's probably the way

22:40.192 --> 22:42.360
Maude would have
wanted it.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.528
Yeah...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.781
Yeah.

If you ask me, the whole thing's
a little juvenile.
