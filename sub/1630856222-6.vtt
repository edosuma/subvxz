18:55.435 --> 18:57.604
I am, but one of the reasons
I'm here right now

18:57.604 --> 19:00.507
is marketing is my biggest
weakness as a company.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.545
I'm doing this full-time
right now.

19:05.545 --> 19:09.416
I grew up in rural Idaho,
went to a two-room schoolhouse.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.686
And then after I graduated,
I moved to Portland.

19:12.686 --> 19:16.757
I blinked and got my first
real, professional job,

19:16.757 --> 19:19.693
blinked and then was married,
blinked and had kids,

19:19.693 --> 19:22.596
blinked and had a house,
and life just was flying by.

19:22.596 --> 19:25.699
And this, like, desire to start
a business was always there.

19:25.699 --> 19:29.669
But starting a business
and not having sales

19:29.669 --> 19:31.605
just seemed
slightly irresponsible

and having a mortgage.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.665

of the market.

20:00.834 --> 20:03.603
Everything about it is small,
literally.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.972

And that makes it
a difficult investment for me

how you blow this thing up.

Jared, I blinked,
and I've been here for 15 years.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.731
What I've learned is,
if you have a good business,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.800
you can get it
to $2 to $3 million

20:33.800 --> 20:37.270

of your execution.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.506
You can make
a fantastic living.

20:39.506 --> 20:42.509

I need to see more scale.

20:42.509 --> 20:43.777
I don't see it
beyond that.

20:43.777 --> 20:46.246

And so, you get a ton of credit
for going for it.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.635
I think this business
can be successful,

21:08.635 --> 21:12.639
but because it's so new
and inventing a new industry,

21:12.639 --> 21:15.642

it can take decades, right?

a career musician.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.879
50-plus years singing in Cayman
on the beach.

26:52.879 --> 26:56.349
Blond-haired calypso singer
goes by The Barefoot Man.

26:56.349 --> 26:57.684
The Barefoot --
The Barefoot Man.

26:57.684 --> 27:01.654
Oh, my God, my wife, like,
just, like, just goes nuts.
That's my dad.

27:01.654 --> 27:04.457
That's my father, right?
Oh, my God!

27:04.457 --> 27:07.393
So my dad -- I've always
been Barefoot's son.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.329
So I never wanted
to get into music,

27:09.329 --> 27:10.497
though I always
wrote music.

27:10.497 --> 27:12.665
And during COVID,
my daughter said,

27:12.665 --> 27:15.602
"I think I might want to be
a musician like grandpa."

27:15.602 --> 27:17.537
And I said, "Well,
let's go make a song."

27:17.537 --> 27:19.739
And in the process of doing
that, I wrote a whole album.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.575
And in that process --
He just mentioned Keith Stegall.

27:22.575 --> 27:25.311
We met through Keith, who's been
a friend of my father's.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.813
And we became friends.
We hit it off.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.749
So, guys, who said, "I'm going
to put two silicone pads

27:29.749 --> 27:31.684
on a pick"?
We have a third partner.

27:31.684 --> 27:34.087
There's actually five of us
in the business.

27:34.087 --> 27:34.654
Five owners?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.389
It's like a herd of ticks
in that.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.358
But we need six
to fill the pack.

27:38.358 --> 27:39.759
Yeah, we need six.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.395
So he was searching
for the best grip

27:42.395 --> 27:44.597
and came across this
nano-suction material.

27:44.597 --> 27:46.499
And when they brought it to
Kevin and I in the first place,

27:46.499 --> 27:48.401
it was,
"It's a really good grip,"

27:48.401 --> 27:49.736
and we just went
right past that

27:49.736 --> 27:51.671
to, "It sticks
to your guitar."

27:51.671 --> 27:54.440
I buy that
it's a better product.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.376
Tell us about the sales.
Absolutely.

27:56.376 --> 27:58.411
So we've been selling
since October of last year,

27:58.411 --> 27:59.579
barely eight months.

27:59.579 --> 28:02.482
We have a total of $60,000 sales
lifetime.

28:02.482 --> 28:04.684
We sell a six-pack,
which is our main product.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.387
So that has either one
of each of the gauges.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.322
We do a thin, medium,
and a heavy gauge,

28:09.322 --> 28:10.390
or we have a multipack,

28:10.390 --> 28:12.492
and that's two of each gauge
in the multipack.

28:12.492 --> 28:14.594
What do you sell it for?
What does it cost to make?

28:14.594 --> 28:16.195
You Sharks
are going to like this.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.464

are you making any money?

28:25.505 --> 28:26.873
Did you make any money
on the $60,000?

28:26.873 --> 28:31.311
We're expecting this year to
have about $120,000 total sales,

28:31.311 --> 28:33.446
and we expect anywhere from
breaking even

28:33.446 --> 28:35.615
to about $20,000
in profit.

28:35.615 --> 28:38.384
We sell primarily on our website
and on Amazon.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.786
We also have
four music shops

28:39.786 --> 28:42.455
that we've been able to get
as wholesalers so far.

28:42.455 --> 28:43.756
And our split this year
we're estimating to be

28:43.756 --> 28:46.459
about 85%
direct to customers

28:46.459 --> 28:47.860

28:47.860 --> 28:50.263

this could be?

28:50.263 --> 28:51.464

pick industry,

I can tell you,
without naming names,

of guitar picks

28:55.768 --> 28:58.204
sells tens and tens
and tens of millions

28:58.204 --> 28:59.539
of packs of picks a year.

28:59.539 --> 29:01.874
So what is an average cost
of a pack of six?
Fifty cents.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.710
Fifty cents.
And this is --
This is $5.

29:03.710 --> 29:06.212

35:11.677 --> 35:14.513
to be the vice president
of design for Tommy Jeans,

35:14.513 --> 35:16.115
to breathe some new energy
into the brand.

35:16.115 --> 35:16.816
Wow.
Wow.

35:16.816 --> 35:19.485
Jennifer,
you're a real loser.
Yeah.

35:19.485 --> 35:20.686
Thank you.
So you have
no experience at all.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.488
Greiner:
Yeah, keep going.

35:22.488 --> 35:25.558
My last role was as
chief merchandizing officer

35:25.558 --> 35:29.428
for a large-scale private
children's wear manufacturer.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.763
It took my entire career
to finally figure out

35:30.763 --> 35:32.832
that kids is what I love doing
the most.

35:32.832 --> 35:35.768
This is definitely the most fun
I've had in -- in my whole
career.

35:35.768 --> 35:38.804
What inspired you to say,
"Enough of the corporate world"?

35:38.804 --> 35:41.607
It was the pandemic,
and my kids were home,

35:41.607 --> 35:43.776
and I was just looking
for things to keep them busy.

35:43.776 --> 35:46.746
We started tie-dyeing
and putting patches on things.

35:46.746 --> 35:48.781
I was like,
"This is so much fun.

35:48.781 --> 35:51.450
This is the white-space idea
that I'm keeping for myself.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.618
I love this."

35:52.618 --> 35:54.653
John: So you're
rolling out kiosks?
Yes.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.422
Where would the kiosk
be going?

35:56.422 --> 35:58.391
So we're looking at
taking these kiosks

35:58.391 --> 35:59.925
to all kinds
of physical locations.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.396
The first people that we're
testing the kiosk with

36:03.396 --> 36:04.730
is actually with Claire's.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.500
They're the premiere destination
of all things tween.
Oh.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.634
That's smart.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.370
But we're also looking at
putting them in kids' clubs

36:11.370 --> 36:13.472
at resorts
and on cruise ships.

36:13.472 --> 36:16.542
And, of course,
department stores and boutiques.

36:16.542 --> 36:18.611
Greiner: Okay,
so when you came in,

36:18.611 --> 36:21.313
I thought that this was
you do this online...

36:21.313 --> 36:22.548
Yes.
...direct to consumer.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.316
I go to your website.
That's correct.
That's correct.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.319
Yeah. Me too.
Is this now an expansion?

36:27.319 --> 36:28.587
Yes.
But, Jennifer, why?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.623
Well, because I'm
a trend forecaster,

36:30.623 --> 36:32.458
and that's how I've been
successful in my career,

36:32.458 --> 36:34.627
by doing things
that haven't been done before.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.730
And this is an incredible
in-store experience.

36:37.730 --> 36:40.199
Everything's about
retail-tainment.

36:40.199 --> 36:41.434
What are your sales?

36:41.434 --> 36:44.336
I launched
in October of '22.

36:44.336 --> 36:47.139
My first holiday season
was $60,000.

36:47.139 --> 36:47.673
Okay.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.276
And year to date,
we've done $110,000.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.411
So it's $170,000
lifetime sales.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.647
You're not making any money
yet, are you?
Not yet.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.482
Cuban: You're not selling
the kiosks at all.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.551
You're putting them in stores.
Right?

36:58.551 --> 37:01.520
It's a very interesting
relationship

37:01.520 --> 37:04.323
with our retail
and venue partners.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.392
I hate
this kiosk idea.

37:06.392 --> 37:09.261
Take your retail
shackles off.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.330
No, no, no.
Set yourself free.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.466
I am --
Be reborn.

37:13.466 --> 37:15.367
I am reborn,
and I'm very happy

37:15.367 --> 37:17.670
to go into this
from a DTC perspective.

37:17.670 --> 37:20.606
But we all know
that customer acquisition costs

37:20.606 --> 37:22.741
are very expensive,
and they're rising,

37:22.741 --> 37:25.211
and they're getting
more and more difficult.

37:25.211 --> 37:27.379
This is customer acquisition.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.514
Yeah, but it's not.
This is --

37:28.514 --> 37:29.749
It's not.
And here's why.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.451
Because we've gotten
to the point now

37:32.451 --> 37:35.254
with direct to consumer
where there's online

37:35.254 --> 37:36.755
and there's in-store.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.759
And typically, when you make
the decision to go in-store...
Right.

37:39.759 --> 37:42.595
...it's the immediacy
of the product, right?
Right.

37:42.595 --> 37:45.364
I can grab it
and get it right there.

37:45.364 --> 37:47.433
That doesn't happen
with your kiosk.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.502
I think you're going to have
people walk up to it

37:49.502 --> 37:51.337
and maybe put in
some information,

37:51.337 --> 37:52.705
which is great
for customer acquisition,

37:52.705 --> 37:54.673
and then expect it
to pop out.
Right.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.309
And you're going to get
a lot of canceled carts

37:57.309 --> 37:59.445
because that product
isn't right there.

37:59.445 --> 38:01.781
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

38:01.781 --> 38:03.449
O'Leary: Daymond,
what are you doing?

38:03.449 --> 38:06.452
I'm struggling.
I like this thing a lot.

38:06.452 --> 38:09.188
You know, this kiosk thing
can either be a massive hit

38:09.188 --> 38:10.723
or a real problem.

38:10.723 --> 38:13.559
It's just too risky for me.
So I'm out.

38:13.559 --> 38:17.296
Jennifer, incredible quality,
great price point.

38:17.296 --> 38:19.632
The sales are so low.

38:19.632 --> 38:22.401
And now
we're going into kiosks.

38:22.401 --> 38:25.171

in Jennifer's customizable
kids clothing brand,

38:39.251 --> 38:41.487

38:41.487 --> 38:43.522
I hear your feedback
about the kiosk,

38:43.522 --> 38:45.724
and it's certainly giving me
a lot to think about.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.494
The people in this space
that I've shown it to

38:48.494 --> 38:51.397
have been very,
very excited about it.

It's an incredible

38:53.332 --> 38:55.734
keeping people
in the store longer.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.504
What do you pay the retailer?
And so --
And the arrangement here,

38:58.504 --> 39:01.574
as we're discussing
going into Claire's,

39:01.574 --> 39:04.443
is that they will receive
30% of the revenue

39:04.443 --> 39:06.278
driven from the machine.
That's fine.

39:06.278 --> 39:07.446
It's a win-win.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.849
Ultimately, I'm holding
the inventory and fulfilling,

39:09.849 --> 39:13.452
so all they have to do is
put this kiosk in their store,

39:13.452 --> 39:14.520
and then it's 100%
incremental volume.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.655
Right.
Greiner: No, I agree.

39:16.655 --> 39:20.392
I'm telling you, this is the
next massive children's brand.

Imagine it as the Build-A-Bear
of apparel.

O'Leary:
Let me take a stab at it.
Okay? You're very impressive.

in the demand.

39:29.735 --> 39:32.438
But before COVID-19,
you got a different virus.

through your veins even now.

39:37.276 --> 39:38.544
You can't let it go.

you're pretty brilliant.

I see this for Disney.
Yes, that's right!

I see this as...
Yes!
Yes, of course.

40:08.207 --> 40:09.408
Of course.
...in places where

40:09.408 --> 40:10.709
you have the mom

All right. So, okay, we're going
to make you an offer.

I don't know.
We're going to figure it out.

40:19.818 --> 40:22.855
I mean, honestly, I've never
done a kids clothing line.

Oh, we're going to
do a kids clothing line.

40:25.691 --> 40:28.027
So at this point...
Yeah.

40:28.027 --> 40:32.298
...while you're on to a great
thing, it's still pretty early.

40:32.298 --> 40:34.500
We're going to offer you
the $250,000.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.502
We want 25%.
Okay.

40:36.502 --> 40:38.570
Ooh.
We'd also like a royalty

40:38.570 --> 40:41.807
because we think you have
a cash flow of 5%.
Mm!
Oye!

40:41.807 --> 40:44.677
Until we make back
the initial investment.
The $250,000.

40:44.677 --> 40:46.478
After that, it goes away.
Of 5%?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.981
5%.

you can negotiate.

not putting up any money.
