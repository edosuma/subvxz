-No.
-No?

05:50.958 --> 05:56.125
No. See, the thing is,
we made a deal, Marc and I,

05:56.875 --> 06:00.333
that when he was done with Khonshu,
he would disappear for good.

06:00.458 --> 06:03.791

Layla and us killed, did it?

-You guys made a deal?

06:17.500 --> 06:19.083
Oh.

06:20.416 --> 06:23.750
Well, hadn't he disappeared
from your life already?

06:25.750 --> 06:29.875
Yeah. I mean, whatever.
His suit was his best feature, wasn't it?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.250
Without Khonshu, there's no more suit,
no more healing, no more power.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.833
Yeah, no more you, I thought.
It's what you said, isn't it?

08:52.125 --> 08:54.541
But believing anything that comes
out of your mouth

08:54.625 --> 08:56.083

08:58.916 --> 09:00.625

-I'm here.

-You're not alone.
-I know I'm not alone.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.208

-I mean, why wouldn't you, right?
-Yeah.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.250
Marc's trying to protect you from Khonshu.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.791
-What?
-That's why he's been pushing you away.

10:26.541 --> 10:29.833
He thinks Khonshu wants you for
his Avatar, and he won't let that happen.

10:30.750 --> 10:33.166
I'm sorry.
I just felt like you should know that.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000

10:38.750 --> 10:40.416
Why are you telling me this now?

10:42.666 --> 10:45.541
I don't know.
I just thought you deserved to know.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.166
Well, it wasn't his call to make.

10:51.666 --> 10:55.041
I don't need protection.
What I need is honesty.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.541
-Yeah. I get that.
-That's more of a "you" thing, isn't it?

11:03.416 --> 11:06.833
What? Being... Honesty?

11:09.041 --> 11:11.916
Yeah. Being honesty.

11:29.875 --> 11:30.916

to life right now

12:51.208 --> 12:53.833
and asked me a riddle for passage,
I'd be thrilled.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.708

13:05.916 --> 13:10.625
Oh. Yeah. It's for my father.
He would've loved to be here.

I'm so sorry.

13:35.958 --> 13:38.875
-Yeah. No, it's fine, really.
-Yeah.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.666
It's fine. Happens.

13:41.875 --> 13:47.125
I bet that he'd be positively
beaming right now,

13:47.666 --> 13:49.666

13:51.875 --> 13:53.708

-It's a maze.
-It's a-maze-ing.

-No, like, there are six paths.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:31.750 --> 14:36.958
-Right. Six points.
-What would they be shooting at?

14:49.250 --> 14:52.000
This whole structure

14:54.708 --> 14:55.958
is a symbol.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.750
-LAYLA: That's the eye of Horus.
-Yeah.

15:01.541 --> 15:02.875
Look at that.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.750
-What?
-Right?

15:05.500 --> 15:08.250
Look, the royal symbol,
protection in the afterlife.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.666
I mean, like, the resources
needed to build this thing.

15:14.458 --> 15:19.000
-Her final Avatar was a pharaoh.
-Whoa! A bloody pharaoh.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.458
-So what? You think it's a map?
-Yeah, well...

15:23.291 --> 15:28.041
Right. So, the eye of Horus
is also the eye of mind, yeah?

15:28.541 --> 15:31.250
Representing the six senses, six points.

15:31.541 --> 15:33.666
So you got the eyebrow
that denotes thoughts.

15:34.083 --> 15:39.000
Pupil, sight, obviously.
This point here is, uh, hearing.

15:39.416 --> 15:45.083
This, smell. Touch.
And this long line ending in a spiral

15:46.583 --> 15:47.666
is the tongue.

15:49.916 --> 15:53.000
The Avatar would be Ammit's voice.

15:55.875 --> 15:56.958
That's right.

16:25.708 --> 16:28.166
Judging by their masks
and ceremonial stance.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.333
They would've been entombed
in here to protect the pharaoh.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.625
The heck's a Heka?

16:35.041 --> 16:38.083
Sorcerers of their time.
They've been down here for centuries.

16:38.291 --> 16:41.208

the unlucky souls who crossed their path.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.208

17:10.125 --> 17:12.791

I'm just saying what I see, and I see lots
of bones and blood going that way.

what if there's maybe another...

17:28.083 --> 17:29.583
There's, like, another...

17:30.750 --> 17:32.666
There's an opening up there. You see that?

17:33.083 --> 17:34.250
Yeah.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.750
-Should we check it out?
-Yeah.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.375
-All right.
-All right. You go.

17:48.500 --> 17:49.500

Thutmose II.

Nefertiti.
Oh, it's gotta be one of the big'uns.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.791
So, you kissed her.

24:54.791 --> 24:56.791
What are you gonna do?
Try and drown us now?

24:57.083 --> 24:58.291
MARC: Yeah, I should.

24:59.250 --> 25:03.500
But you also told her the truth
about why I've been pushing her away.

25:04.375 --> 25:05.875
And that was unexpected.

25:06.875 --> 25:07.875
Yeah.

25:08.958 --> 25:11.625
Wow. Look at that.
Look at all these relics.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.125
Macedonian? No. What?

25:16.583 --> 25:20.000
No way. That's not right.
That can't be right. That's Macedonian.

25:20.958 --> 25:22.500
But the only pharaoh...

25:23.458 --> 25:26.083
But, I mean, he insisted
on calling himself Egyptian.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.250
But...

25:34.875 --> 25:40.583
I think we're looking
at the long-lost tomb

25:41.500 --> 25:43.333
of Alexander the Great.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.041
You handled that beautifully.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.791
LAYLA: Why do all men like you

26:03.208 --> 26:08.583
feel it necessary to be
just so condescending?

My little scarab.

26:19.916 --> 26:22.166
Isn't that what your father
used to call you?

26:23.500 --> 26:26.041
Abdullah El-Faouly.

26:27.250 --> 26:31.333
One of Egypt's most unique archaeologists.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.333
He would be so proud of you

26:38.958 --> 26:41.791
if he knew that you were among the first

26:43.250 --> 26:47.208
to confirm for the world
what he always believed.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.250
Egyptian gods walk among us.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.041
The scales

26:58.375 --> 27:04.208
achieve their judgment by revealing
to me moments of sin and pain.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.041
And your husband...

27:08.708 --> 27:11.000
He is in agony.

27:11.791 --> 27:14.625
More pain than anyone could bear.

27:15.916 --> 27:17.708
But he still hasn't told you the truth.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.500
Well, you're obviously dying to.

27:22.750 --> 27:27.291
So why don't you just go ahead?
The floor is yours.

27:30.625 --> 27:31.791

you'd probably put it in a place where

-What?

I'm talking to you, Marc!

-Come on. Let's go, let's go.
-No.

-We need to go right now.
-Marc, no. No.

31:47.041 --> 31:49.666
-What happened to my father?
-Listen to me.

31:50.083 --> 31:53.916
We need to leave right now. I will explain
everything, I swear. But we have to go.

31:54.083 --> 31:57.500

-You were there.
-I...

32:14.125 --> 32:15.458
Yeah, you were there.

32:17.291 --> 32:20.250
(SOFTLY) I was there. Yeah, I was there.

32:21.291 --> 32:26.291
Yeah. And how did he die?

32:34.541 --> 32:36.166
My partner got greedy

32:38.416 --> 32:40.291
and he executed everyone at the dig site.

32:43.041 --> 32:47.125
I tried to save your father,
but I couldn't save him. And I...

32:49.458 --> 32:54.708
No. But you brought
a killer right to him. Right?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.041
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

32:58.125 --> 33:00.166
He shot me too.
I was supposed to die that night.

But I didn't die that night.
And I should have.

since the moment we met.

That's the reason that we met.

33:24.583 --> 33:26.583
You just had a guilty conscience.

They're here.

-Okay. Go, find it. I'll hold them off.

34:06.291 --> 34:12.750
I remember the first morning I woke up
knowing that Khonshu was gone.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.875
The quiet was liberating.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.875
You're a free man.

34:23.333 --> 34:27.750
And, of course,
with that freedom comes choice.

34:29.666 --> 34:34.083
And right now, you have
a very important decision to make.

34:41.750 --> 34:42.750
Okay.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.416
(YELLS)

35:31.541 --> 35:34.166

who won't save themselves.

All right, Rosser. It's all right.
Those old bones can't hurt you.

36:58.916 --> 37:02.458
Well, at least now we know what happened
to poor Montalban.

37:02.833 --> 37:06.541
Yes, and to anyone who chooses
a path of greed.

37:09.333 --> 37:12.833
-Does this mean the treasure is gone, too?
-Oh, I think not.

37:14.375 --> 37:16.916
Do you notice anything unusual
about that statue?

37:17.666 --> 37:21.500
The statue of Coyolxauhqui,
lunar god of the Aztecs.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.958

You're all right. Come on. Come on.

39:49.708 --> 39:52.500
There you go. All right.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.333
Marc, you can't keep doing this.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.750
ARTHUR: I know that you're having
a great deal of difficulty

40:16.166 --> 40:17.916
being able to differentiate

40:18.416 --> 40:21.583
between what's real
and what's in your head.

40:23.500 --> 40:28.791
I hope you don't mind but I took the
liberty of borrowing the film you brought.

40:29.416 --> 40:34.041
(CHUCKLES) It was fun to see that my old
VHS player still worked.

40:38.041 --> 40:43.041
How many times would you say you've
seen that movie? Approximately?

40:44.541 --> 40:45.541
Hmm?

40:48.666 --> 40:50.083
I liked the villain.

40:51.791 --> 40:56.333
"No tree can ascend to the light of heaven
if it doesn't descend

40:56.500 --> 40:58.125
"to the depths of hell."

40:58.791 --> 41:03.750
That's a good line. Yeah. The plot makes
a real meal out of a lunar god.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.708
And didn't you say that
you worked for one?

41:08.500 --> 41:09.500
Hmm?

41:09.666 --> 41:11.500
What do you make out of that similarity?

41:11.791 --> 41:15.333
I mean,
given the production value of that film,

41:15.458 --> 41:18.166
I can't imagine that
too many other people have seen it.

41:19.458 --> 41:22.625
What do you think? Is that a coincidence?

41:24.416 --> 41:26.791
(WEAKLY) I don't... I think...

41:30.000 --> 41:31.458
-What?
-I think someone...

41:32.708 --> 41:36.541
-I think someone...
-I know. I'm sorry about that.

41:37.333 --> 41:40.708
But remember, you're only sedated
because of your own behavior.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.583
And the effects will wear off soon.

41:44.750 --> 41:50.625
Marc, we don't live in a material world.
We live in a psychic world.

41:51.666 --> 41:56.750
Right? And we're only able
to make indirect inferences

41:56.875 --> 42:03.166
about the nature of reality.
Like, take, for example, this pen, right?

42:04.000 --> 42:08.083
To me, this is a writing utensil. Right?

42:08.875 --> 42:13.291
To my dog, it's a chew toy.
Both are accurate.

42:14.208 --> 42:18.000
Right? It's just a question
of context and perspective.

42:19.791 --> 42:25.375
And all I'm asking of you is an honest
assessment of your situation.

42:37.458 --> 42:39.166
Everything reminds me...

42:41.916 --> 42:45.791
-Everything reminds me...
-Reminds you of what?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
Hmm?

42:49.583 --> 42:50.708
Of your past?

42:52.458 --> 42:53.625
Of Steven?

43:00.541 --> 43:01.958
You know Steven?

43:02.666 --> 43:07.291
Of course I know Steven.
But, Marc, I wanna talk to you right now.

43:07.583 --> 43:12.208
And I have noticed, all right,
in our sessions, a pattern developing.

43:12.416 --> 43:16.916
Every time I ask you direct questions,
you are triggered, you're overwhelmed,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.208
and that's normal, all right? Many of us,
when asked to look into

43:21.416 --> 43:25.958
our innermost experiences,
into the nucleus of our personality,

43:26.041 --> 43:29.208
we close our eyes. It's understandable.

43:32.125 --> 43:35.125
I can't help you
if you don't help yourself.

43:37.166 --> 43:38.166
You shot me.

43:43.791 --> 43:45.000
You shot me.

43:46.416 --> 43:51.833
Marc? Marc? Hey. Hey now.
If we can't calmly sit here

43:53.541 --> 43:56.000
and take inventory
of your feelings... Marc.

43:57.333 --> 44:00.083
-Marc, listen. I know...
-No. You stay away from me!

44:00.375 --> 44:03.125
Truly, I understand how you're feeling.

44:03.958 --> 44:09.541
I too have suffered from mental illness,
breaks in psychic awareness,

44:09.750 --> 44:12.625
manic episodes, followed by depression.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.958
-I know what you're feeling.
-Unlock the door.

44:15.083 --> 44:16.625
-It can be healed.
-Unlock the door!

44:16.791 --> 44:20.083
I know you can be healed.
Marc. Marc, please...

44:20.250 --> 44:21.291
Stay away from me!

44:21.625 --> 44:23.750
Marc, don't do this.
You're only getting...

44:27.416 --> 44:29.875
All right. Be gentle with him.
Don't hurt him. All right?

44:31.416 --> 44:33.041
(SCREAMS)

44:35.333 --> 44:38.208
-You all right? You all right?
-Yeah.

45:02.541 --> 45:04.541
(FOOTSTEPS RUNNING)

45:10.375 --> 45:11.625
(SARCOPHAGUS THUDDING)

45:17.583 --> 45:18.875
MAN: Let me out!

45:18.958 --> 45:22.833
Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!
Please! Please, someone let me out!

45:29.958 --> 45:31.000
Steven?

45:32.916 --> 45:34.791
-Marc?
-Steven?

45:34.875 --> 45:35.916
Marc.

45:43.791 --> 45:46.541
-How is this possible?
-I don't know.

45:47.666 --> 45:49.500
What's the last thing that you remember?

45:50.166 --> 45:53.000
-Harrow shot us.
-Yes!

45:53.583 --> 45:56.958
Yes. Exactly. Exactly. All right.

45:57.208 --> 46:00.375
We gotta get out of here.
Follow me. Come on.

46:08.583 --> 46:10.583
(RUMBLING)

46:35.166 --> 46:36.166
Hi.

46:36.250 --> 46:38.166
(BOTH SCREAMING)
