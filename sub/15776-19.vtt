[sighs]

39:04.759 --> 39:09.055
BORN OUT OF NEGLECT AND FORTUNE
OF FIRES OF BETRAYAL,

39:09.138 --> 39:13.350
THE SEEDS OF VILLAINY WERE SOWN
AT THE STREET FAIR.

39:13.434 --> 39:17.938
A LITTLE GIRL NAMED MILLIE
VALIANTLY WON

39:18.022 --> 39:20.983
A BEAUTIFUL STUFFED NEW FRIEND.

39:27.490 --> 39:32.453
BUT HER ONE MOMENT OF PURE JOY
WAS CRUELLY PUSHED ASIDE

39:32.536 --> 39:38.793
AND SPUN REALLY, REALLY FAST
BY YOU, THE MIGHTY B.

39:38.876 --> 39:42.963
FORTUNATELY, THE GHASTLY GURAFFE
WAS SHOWN THE DARK LIGHT

39:43.047 --> 39:46.258
BY MR. EVIL PANTS.

39:46.342 --> 39:50.513
HE TOLD ME I DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
SECOND BANANA ANYMORE...

39:50.596 --> 39:53.933
FOR IT IS NOW MY TURN TO SHINE.

39:54.016 --> 39:56.143
HEE HEE, HA HA,
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.312
{\an5}HEE HEE, HA HA,
HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO.

39:58.395 --> 40:02.775
FRAMING YOU WAS JUST THE ICING
ON THE EVIL CAKE.

40:02.858 --> 40:03.818
- [grunting]

40:03.901 --> 40:06.821
SURELY YOU DON'T EXPECT
TO GET AWAY WITH THIS.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.239
- NO, MIGHTY B.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.574
I EXPECT YOU TO CRY.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.705
- HEY, DON'T PLAY WITH SCISSORS!

40:16.789 --> 40:20.000
- WHO ANNOYS
THE GHASTLY GURAFFE?

40:20.084 --> 40:22.503
- ME, THE HELPFUL HORNET,

40:22.586 --> 40:26.465
WITH MY FELLOW CRIME FIGHTER...

40:26.549 --> 40:28.425
TAPPY!

40:33.180 --> 40:35.933
- IS THIS REALLY THE TIME
TO SAY "I TOLD YOU SO," HAPS?

40:38.018 --> 40:39.687
THANKS FOR THE SAVE, GENTLEMEN.

40:39.770 --> 40:41.772
BEARS, GET READY TO HIBERNATE!

40:58.122 --> 40:59.248
- YEEEAH!

41:15.222 --> 41:16.849
squeak!

41:27.818 --> 41:28.235
[gasps]

41:28.319 --> 41:30.070
NO PANTS, NO EVIL.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.031
THE EVIL'S IN THE PANTS!

41:32.114 --> 41:33.616
TAKE OFF EVERYBODY'S PANTS!

41:33.699 --> 41:36.535
- OKEY DOKEY.

41:48.547 --> 41:52.134
- AND AFTER WE SPENT
ALL THAT TIME DRESSING THEM.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.136
- SHOW'S OVER, GURAFFE.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.512
HAND OVER EVIL PANTS,

41:55.596 --> 41:57.723
AND MAYBE WE CAN AT LEAST REMAIN
ACQUAINTANCES.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.100
- NEVER.

42:18.577 --> 42:22.122
[Mr. Evil Pants squeaking]

42:22.206 --> 42:24.750
- SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR NAMESAKE,
MR. EVIL PANTS.

42:32.007 --> 42:35.970
- SORRY I HELPED MR. PANTS
RUIN YOUR GOOD NAME.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.472
HE'S VERY PERSUASIVE.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.224
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

42:40.307 --> 42:43.227
- AND THUS ANOTHER DAY IS SAVED
BY THE MIGHTY B!

42:43.310 --> 42:45.271
NO NEED FOR THANKS;

42:45.354 --> 42:48.983
PUNCHING EVIL IS ITS OWN REWARD.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.695
[laughs boisterously]

42:56.073 --> 42:57.908
SEE? I TOLD YOU I WAS FRAMED.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.618
CAN I HAVE MY SASH BACK?

42:59.702 --> 43:01.912
- FINE.
YOU'RE REINSTATED.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.540
LET US NEVER SPEAK OF THIS
TEDDY BEAR PICNIC EVER AGAIN.

43:07.167 --> 43:10.004
- I'M BACK, BEES!

43:10.087 --> 43:11.880
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

43:11.964 --> 43:14.550
[glorious music]

43:20.306 --> 43:23.017
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.685
THE TAIWANESE BEAR'S BACK HOME,

43:24.768 --> 43:27.146
AND THANKFULLY
HE'S NOT PRESSING CHARGES.

43:27.229 --> 43:28.605
HOW'S OUR REAL PRISONER?

43:30.691 --> 43:31.900
- BUT WAIT.

43:31.984 --> 43:33.360
IF IT WAS THE PANTS
THAT MADE HIM EVIL,

43:33.444 --> 43:35.696
CAN'T WE LET HIM OUT OF JAIL,

43:35.779 --> 43:37.906
AT LEAST ON PAROLE?

43:37.990 --> 43:40.367
- NOPE, NO DICE.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.494
THAT BEAR'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

43:42.578 --> 43:43.996
ASK ME TOMORROW.

43:44.079 --> 43:48.083
LISTEN, BEN, IF THERE'S
ONE THING MY ARCH TAUGHT ME,

43:48.167 --> 43:51.503
IT'S THAT THE MIGHTY B
OCCASIONALLY NEEDS BACKUP.

43:51.587 --> 43:52.796
SO TELL YOU WHAT;
I'M PREPARED TO PROMOTE YOU

43:52.880 --> 43:58.218
FROM TOP SIDEKICK CANDIDATE TO
PROBATIONARY INTERIM SIDEKICK

43:58.302 --> 44:00.220
FOR ONE BUSINESS WEEK.
