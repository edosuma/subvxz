03:28.320 --> 03:33.160
Perhaps this is a good
place for a lunch break? Mm.

It's just a turtle.

04:07.560 --> 04:08.880
Hello.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.000
Ah! Wait!

04:14.640 --> 04:18.600
Where'd it go?
It can't have gone far.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.160
Turtle?

05:06.720 --> 05:10.600
Wow. Hello, Sarah.
What are you doing here?

05:10.600 --> 05:13.240
Trying to ride all the way
round the park.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.120
See?

05:15.120 --> 05:16.920
We've been everywhere.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.760
Huh. So, you found our pond.

05:22.760 --> 05:24.240
YOUR pond? Uh-huh.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.280
It's our favourite place.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.600
Ah, you met Turtle, too.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.800
She's funny,
once you get to know her.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.840
We better go.
FLAMINGO SQUAWKS

05:34.840 --> 05:37.760
Still a lot to see, it seems.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.680
OK. We've got to go, too.

05:40.680 --> 05:45.280
Um... How do we...?
Oh, yeah. Don't be afraid.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.240
Pedal and don't stop till
you get to the top.

05:49.240 --> 05:52.920
It's fun. Hmm... It is. It's fun.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.680
You can do it. Ready? Mm.

05:59.760 --> 06:04.880
I... Sky... Dry... Go!
