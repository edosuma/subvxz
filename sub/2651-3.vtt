[ Gasps ]

17:50.080 --> 17:53.391
I hope that this new one
has some good manners.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.994
Mom, stop!

17:56.320 --> 17:58.960
I know this whole thing
is a little scary for you.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.920
Last time you were pregnant, you kinda did
it alone 'cause Dad wasn't around much.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.310
But this time,
you have two partners.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.873
That's sweet.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.633
And so are you.

18:10.720 --> 18:15.351
Especially with a little bit of
sugar in your face. Let me see.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.840
Mmm!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.320
¡Ay! What happened?

18:19.440 --> 18:22.000
Your shirt couldn't take it anymore!
The stupid dry cleaners!

18:22.120 --> 18:23.349
Oh!
Where is it?

18:23.440 --> 18:24.920
[ Fabric Tears ] ¡Ay, no!

18:25.040 --> 18:27.635
You're running out of arms, Mom! A
maternity store's right over there.

18:27.720 --> 18:28.836
[ Fabric Tearing ] Ah!

18:29.000 --> 18:30.878
What was that? I don't
know, but let's go.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.519
Oh!

18:32.600 --> 18:35.672
It's you. I thought it was
the guy coming to shave me.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.120
Oh, good.
They haven't started.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.441
He had a little piece of
bloody toilet paper on his neck.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.995
It was disconcerting.
Hmm.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.634
Are you okay?
Mm-hmm.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.234
Yeah. I had
a pretty crazy day,

18:45.320 --> 18:47.880
but it-it had
an interesting ending.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.316
And this tortoise
was 200 years old.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.591
I'm sorry. I'm boring you
with my trip.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.832
No, not at all. You hot-air
ballooned over an active volcano.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.310
Three weeks ago I made every
green light on Jefferson.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.880
Couldn't stop talking about it.
[ Chuckles ]

18:59.960 --> 19:03.476
- You e-mailed me.
- Oh, God.

[ Door Closes ]

19:05.120 --> 19:08.192
Mom shaved Skylar's head?
That's hilarious!

19:08.280 --> 19:11.352
It's not gonna be so fun the next time
she bothers to show up for school.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.440
What do you care? You know
you don't even like her.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.994
I don't.
Skylar's awful.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.799
Mom actually did me
a huge favor.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.832
Oh, my God. Do not tell her that.
[ Chuckles ]

19:18.920 --> 19:20.832
She will never shut up.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.832
I know. Remember when you
admitted that you didn't hate...

19:22.920 --> 19:24.680
that James Taylor concert
she dragged you to?

19:24.760 --> 19:27.195
She was unbearable!
"I told you!"

[ Together ] "He's got
the voice of an angel!"

[ Laughs ] [Laughs]

19:32.520 --> 19:34.796
She's such a nerd.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.076
I kind of miss her though.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.877
You know, honey, I don't
want to do this...

19:52.000 --> 19:53.593
unless you are really ready.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.160
I am ready.

I don't know if I am. Me either.

[ Soft Gasp ]

20:00.280 --> 20:02.715
You wanna wait?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.553
Five more years?

20:07.280 --> 20:10.079
[Jay] I've always seen life
like a series of doors.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.675
Sometimes you get to choose
the door you go through.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.592
Sometimes you don't
get that choice.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.956
But you still gotta
walk through.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.036
So you can either
go kicking and screaming...

20:23.120 --> 20:26.511
or walk through
with your head held high.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.913
And since I don't get to choose
the door I'm about to go through,

20:37.000 --> 20:40.550
I just pray
it's a healthy, happy kid.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.199
And a boy.

Hang on one sec. Okay.
[ Swooshing ]

20:53.480 --> 20:56.154
Is that the funniest thing ever?
[ Laughs ] Oh, yeah!

Oh. Oh, my gosh. Mitchell, come here.
You have to see what Claire sent us.

Oh, Phil!

I don't know how comfortable I am
with this guy teaching our kid.
