WEBVTT

00:00.133 --> 00:01.880
My name is Max William Easton.

00:01.905 --> 00:03.560
<i>I'm a British Intelligence officer.</i>

00:03.585 --> 00:04.841
<i>There's no point taking out</i>

00:04.866 --> 00:05.926
<i>their scientists</i>

00:05.951 --> 00:07.553
<i>if we don't take out the financiers.</i>

00:08.575 --> 00:10.896
Once we get to the truth, you
can help us get it out there.

00:10.921 --> 00:13.333
Angus, it's Olivia. I've got
something. Can I come in?

00:13.358 --> 00:15.168
<i>Kahani walked Ardavan into an ambush.</i>

00:15.268 --> 00:16.295
Clearly, he's no lawyer.

00:16.335 --> 00:17.861
- Maybe he's Agency.
- Who sent him?

00:17.951 --> 00:19.453
Oh!

00:23.544 --> 00:24.915
I found this on White's phone.

00:24.990 --> 00:26.225
Maybe it's not a phone number.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.784
Stay with me, you bastard.

00:27.809 --> 00:29.957
<i>Ashkan Davoud, a scientist
with detailed knowledge...</i>

00:29.982 --> 00:31.444
<i>Detailed knowledge of what we believe</i>

00:31.469 --> 00:33.644
<i>to be Tehran's reactivated program.</i>

00:33.755 --> 00:35.103
There is no such program.

00:35.146 --> 00:37.103
Everything you're gonna say is in here.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.223
What evidence would you have
to back up your claim?

00:40.275 --> 00:41.519
<i>They're gonna want verification.</i>

00:41.543 --> 00:42.678
There's no silver bullet.

00:42.768 --> 00:43.937
Intelligence that helps them

00:43.962 --> 00:46.132
complete the picture.
Soil samples, air, water.

00:46.267 --> 00:47.599
Whoever we send out there,

00:47.693 --> 00:49.181
they can't come back.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.169
So, how are you doing, Jordan?

00:56.242 --> 00:58.345
Like a guy with only the gym
to occupy him.

00:58.753 --> 01:01.223
- Adjusting okay?
- Mary Anne and I

01:01.248 --> 01:04.318
have another baby on the way,
so there's that.

01:05.029 --> 01:06.787
Could do without the fan club, though.

01:07.085 --> 01:08.320
Don't deserve it.

01:08.451 --> 01:09.695
Don't like celebrity, huh?

01:09.792 --> 01:11.327
It's just kind of weird
being praised for something

01:11.351 --> 01:13.320
I don't even do anymore.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.224
What would you say
if I told you we had a mission?

01:16.276 --> 01:18.671
One that could amount to plenty,
change everything?

01:19.357 --> 01:20.584
I guess I'd repeat the words

01:20.609 --> 01:22.511
my shrink keeps telling me.

01:22.769 --> 01:24.405
"Change is good.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.974
Change keeps us alive."

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.829 --> 02:52.866
- Did he give you anything?
- No.

02:53.698 --> 02:55.734
Nothing.

03:10.604 --> 03:12.273
George?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.872
Who was it?

03:19.284 --> 03:21.287
Agency, most likely.

03:22.555 --> 03:24.176
They'll come looking for him.

03:24.243 --> 03:26.684
- How long do you think we have?
- I don't know.

03:29.855 --> 03:32.734
If this isn't a phone number,
we need to find out what it is.

03:33.660 --> 03:34.891
The fire alarm was a feint,

03:34.916 --> 03:36.518
which means they probably snatched White

03:36.543 --> 03:38.579
on his way to the school,
so start at the school,

03:38.604 --> 03:40.915
move out from there. CCTV. ANPR.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.809
Anything that we think we can use, okay?

03:42.834 --> 03:45.219
- Call on White's line.
- Thanks.

03:46.846 --> 03:47.903
Hello?

03:47.968 --> 03:49.502
<i>Who is this?</i>

03:50.200 --> 03:51.207
<i>Elliot Taylor.</i>

03:51.232 --> 03:52.509
Where's George White?

03:54.573 --> 03:56.309
Listen to me. This is Amanda Jones.

03:56.334 --> 03:58.512
You better tell me what the fuck
is going on over there,

03:58.537 --> 04:00.644
<i>and think twice before you lie to me.</i>

04:01.979 --> 04:04.347
I can't get them to work as coordinates.

04:05.331 --> 04:06.577
IP address?

04:06.624 --> 04:08.035
It's a call sign.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.297
You substitute a letter
for the first number

04:11.322 --> 04:12.457
in each of the batches.

04:12.484 --> 04:14.793
November, seven, one, four, X-Ray,

04:14.818 --> 04:17.202
Yankee, Yankee, nine, zero, zero, golf.

04:17.343 --> 04:18.776
It's an aircraft call sign.

04:19.012 --> 04:21.017
Maybe White organized
a flight for Davoud.

04:21.132 --> 04:22.268
Yeah, that's possible.

04:22.302 --> 04:23.404
What do you mean, possible?

04:23.429 --> 04:24.997
Have a bit of faith in your old man.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.756
Hey.

04:29.443 --> 04:30.717
Kahani's dead.

04:31.322 --> 04:32.858
What happened?

04:32.958 --> 04:34.528
He knew I was onto him.

04:34.748 --> 04:35.996
He came after me.

04:36.096 --> 04:37.131
Are you okay?

04:37.223 --> 04:38.925
<i>- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
- You sure?

04:39.366 --> 04:41.223
I'm fine, Harry.

04:41.808 --> 04:43.432
Okay, I'm just...
I'm here with Max now.

04:43.457 --> 04:44.704
I'm putting you on speaker.

04:45.050 --> 04:46.140
Kahani's dead.

04:46.173 --> 04:47.919
- What?
- Where are you now?

04:48.108 --> 04:49.472
In his house.

04:50.501 --> 04:52.224
<i>I found two phones hidden.</i>

04:52.852 --> 04:54.287
A message came up on one of them.

04:54.312 --> 04:56.683
"Operation Green Light.
Thursday, 1:00 a.m."

04:56.730 --> 04:58.122
"Confirm." Number's blocked.

04:58.305 --> 05:00.234
- Did you check the phone history?
<i>- I did.</i>

05:00.313 --> 05:02.148
Every time Kahani
received a message on one phone,

05:02.173 --> 05:04.376
he'd send the exact same message
via the second phone

05:04.401 --> 05:05.469
to another blocked number.

05:05.524 --> 05:06.959
So he was a bridge?

05:06.984 --> 05:08.130
Yeah, between who?

05:08.294 --> 05:09.896
I'm on it.

05:10.896 --> 05:12.156
I'm coming out there.

05:12.219 --> 05:13.587
No.

05:13.725 --> 05:15.394
<i>I don't need you to look after me.</i>

05:15.693 --> 05:17.898
I know you don't
need looking after, Leyla.

05:17.923 --> 05:19.191
- Just...<i>
- Harry.</i>

05:20.184 --> 05:21.808
I'm fine.

05:22.102 --> 05:23.486
Okay?

05:30.983 --> 05:33.820
- I've got to go.
- Of course.

05:33.854 --> 05:35.887
She wouldn't be in this shit
if it wasn't for me,

05:35.914 --> 05:38.333
- and...
- You absolutely have to go.

05:38.668 --> 05:41.208
I'll stay here, keep on the call
signs, see where it leads.

05:41.293 --> 05:42.462
Yeah.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.923
Right.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.063
I've never been much good at this.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.135
We never really got a chance, did we?

06:08.267 --> 06:09.570
To what?

06:13.086 --> 06:14.361
To...

06:14.394 --> 06:15.660
Hey.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.982
Okay.

07:14.998 --> 07:16.131
Pullman.

07:16.156 --> 07:17.311
I've got something for you.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.864
<i>You'll need to rally the troops.</i>

07:19.124 --> 07:21.328
Thank God. Been sort of...

07:21.492 --> 07:23.087
praying for some action
over here, ma'am.

07:23.174 --> 07:26.053
It's not that kind of action.
Not yet, anyway.

07:53.344 --> 07:54.813
I made coffee.

07:56.981 --> 07:58.851
Yes, please.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.932
How are the girls?

08:06.139 --> 08:07.693
Asleep.

08:11.416 --> 08:14.053
Chloe won't stop talking about him.

08:15.186 --> 08:16.922
Her new big brother.

08:17.729 --> 08:20.786
It's incredible how fast kids adjust,

08:21.327 --> 08:22.789
accept things,

08:23.581 --> 08:25.352
anything, as normal.

08:28.121 --> 08:29.791
I can't.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.432
I know.

08:40.299 --> 08:42.032
What's out there in the barn?

08:45.525 --> 08:47.487
All the things I can't ask.

08:52.677 --> 08:54.291
Who was he?

08:56.328 --> 08:58.697
The man in the video.

08:59.058 --> 09:00.699
The man you killed.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.169
He was a...

09:05.269 --> 09:06.820
scientist.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.935
He worked for the British government.

09:09.102 --> 09:10.439
Did you know him?

09:10.570 --> 09:12.805
Not personally, no.

09:15.734 --> 09:17.863
They wanted him silenced.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.864
I silenced him.

09:26.022 --> 09:27.721
How many?

09:28.469 --> 09:30.586
How many have you...

09:31.944 --> 09:33.813
...silenced?

09:35.233 --> 09:37.022
You don't know?

09:38.895 --> 09:41.000
Of course you know.

09:42.728 --> 09:44.631
You never questioned it?

09:46.661 --> 09:48.776
Not at first.

09:50.336 --> 09:52.806
I believed what they told me.

09:54.879 --> 09:57.515
That we were making a difference.

09:58.792 --> 10:01.161
Making the world a safer place.

10:01.294 --> 10:03.063
And did you?

10:05.317 --> 10:06.750
No.

10:07.444 --> 10:09.086
Not really.

10:11.230 --> 10:14.065
Blood begets blood, they say,
and it never ends.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.238
That's why I left.

10:19.272 --> 10:20.507
But you didn't.

10:20.613 --> 10:22.483
Did you?

10:23.026 --> 10:24.210
Leave?

10:24.243 --> 10:26.412
I'm gonna fix this, Anna.

10:26.649 --> 10:28.415
This whole mess, I'm gonna fix it.

10:28.448 --> 10:29.783
I promise.

10:30.237 --> 10:32.394
So that you and the girls are safe.

11:58.416 --> 11:59.744
Mm-hmm.

13:09.248 --> 13:12.721
Operation Green Light
will commence at 0100 hours.

13:12.965 --> 13:15.802
The Alin power plant.

13:16.387 --> 13:18.022
We'll get you as close as we can

13:18.047 --> 13:20.022
to carry out meaningful tests.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.522
We know there is no silver bullet here.

13:22.547 --> 13:23.553
We just need anything

13:23.578 --> 13:25.508
that can corroborate
Davoud's testimony...

13:25.598 --> 13:27.599
soil samples, air, water.

13:27.728 --> 13:28.748
Yes.

13:28.773 --> 13:30.814
I was on the IAEA inspection team.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.469
That's why we picked you, Ms. De Silva.

13:32.494 --> 13:34.262
Alin was never on itinerary.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.435
Because it is
a conventional power plant.

13:36.536 --> 13:38.647
We believe the Iranians
are adapting this facility

13:38.672 --> 13:40.820
and using it to skirt
the provisions of the deal.

13:40.927 --> 13:42.608
Can we get our inspectors in there?

13:42.642 --> 13:44.337
We've requested access to the site.

13:44.376 --> 13:45.911
It's been denied by Tehran.

13:47.446 --> 13:48.811
Look...

13:48.948 --> 13:50.953
I will be straight with you.

13:51.084 --> 13:53.453
This is a high-risk operation.

13:54.110 --> 13:55.720
If any of you choose not to go,

13:55.745 --> 13:57.915
no one in this room will think
any worse of you.

14:01.017 --> 14:04.606
Rest assured we're placing you
in the best possible hands.

14:05.017 --> 14:06.619
Major Franklin.

14:10.882 --> 14:12.489
Thank you.

14:15.217 --> 14:16.637
I know you're nervous.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.577
Understandable.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.780
We'll get you in, and then
we'll bring you home again.

14:22.407 --> 14:24.055
All right?

14:43.568 --> 14:45.804
Mama?

16:10.424 --> 16:12.860
I have so much love for you.

16:41.394 --> 16:42.834
We got an accident report.

16:42.859 --> 16:44.053
This is where the collision happened.

16:44.077 --> 16:45.514
- CCTV?
- None.

16:45.539 --> 16:46.973
Okay, check all the houses
on the street.

16:46.998 --> 16:48.806
See if any of them have
a home security cam.

16:48.862 --> 16:49.939
Elliot, this is...

16:49.964 --> 16:53.241
Seth Pullman. You're Elliot?

16:53.538 --> 16:55.933
- I am.
- I was expecting a man.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.569
Well, you got me.

16:58.019 --> 16:59.789
Amanda Jones sent me to assist you

16:59.814 --> 17:01.513
in the search for George White.

17:03.220 --> 17:04.594
We can manage.

17:05.102 --> 17:06.561
Thank you.

17:12.809 --> 17:14.944
I don't have a choice, do I?

17:15.473 --> 17:18.630
I prefer not to think of it
in those terms.

18:47.938 --> 18:49.021
You didn't need to come.

18:49.290 --> 18:50.441
Huh?

18:50.554 --> 18:51.871
What was that?

18:51.922 --> 18:54.558
How was the six-hour flight?

18:54.726 --> 18:56.895
Yeah, it was all right.
Uh, watched a film,

18:57.055 --> 18:59.091
the food was actually
half decent. Yeah.

19:00.665 --> 19:04.069
You're thirsty? You want some coffee?
Something to eat?

19:04.140 --> 19:06.678
Yeah, coffee would be great. Thanks.

19:15.866 --> 19:17.249
So...

19:17.522 --> 19:18.957
where is he?

19:37.534 --> 19:40.104
Ah. Thanks.

19:42.084 --> 19:43.967
So, what you got?

19:45.540 --> 19:47.545
Kahani had our kill list.

19:50.165 --> 19:51.241
Was he Agency?

19:51.294 --> 19:53.831
I don't know. Come look at this.

19:54.212 --> 19:56.515
- This is our original list, right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:56.575 --> 19:58.856
Every single one of these CVs
in our briefing papers.

19:59.077 --> 20:00.311
Yeah. And?

20:00.605 --> 20:01.994
They were a lie.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.295
They made out the scientists
to be much higher up the chain

20:04.329 --> 20:06.431
than they were. See these?

20:06.560 --> 20:08.900
These are their original CVs.

20:09.289 --> 20:10.653
All right, how'd you know?

20:10.714 --> 20:13.050
I went through Kahani's files.

20:13.845 --> 20:16.506
Remember Ahmadi,
the last guy on our list?

20:16.573 --> 20:19.678
- Yeah.
- I went to see his widow.

20:20.454 --> 20:22.213
His files were doctored.

20:22.736 --> 20:24.630
All of them were.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.385
Why?

20:28.698 --> 20:30.206
I don't know.

20:30.801 --> 20:32.708
Kahani had everything.

20:33.922 --> 20:35.761
He had everything on us.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.287
Maybe Kahani wasn't Agency.

20:54.371 --> 20:56.541
Maybe he was Tehran.

20:59.044 --> 21:01.433
If that's true, then that means
the Iranians knew we were here.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.307
Yeah, maybe they gave us the kill list.

21:03.747 --> 21:06.951
Maybe we took out everyone
the regime wanted us to.

21:16.697 --> 21:18.204
Uh, who's this?

21:18.970 --> 21:21.038
Reza Esfahani.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.975
He works at the Ministry of Defense.

21:24.682 --> 21:26.732
He links everyone on the kill list.

21:26.872 --> 21:28.687
I found a picture of him
in Ahmadi's apartment.

21:28.712 --> 21:30.445
He's the one thing they have in common.

21:30.547 --> 21:32.400
And you think he's the source
of the kill list?

21:32.425 --> 21:33.880
Maybe.

21:34.244 --> 21:36.614
Maybe he's on one end of these messages.

21:38.104 --> 21:39.686
He gave the list to Kahani,

21:39.711 --> 21:41.854
who passed it on to someone on our side.

21:46.164 --> 21:47.746
Right.

21:51.335 --> 21:53.572
Well, there's only one way to find out.

21:56.373 --> 21:58.088
Okay, he's leaving.

22:00.119 --> 22:01.922
- You see him?
- Got him.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.184
Come on.

22:50.455 --> 22:53.092
Now we find out who's on
the other end of those messages.

22:57.968 --> 22:59.208
Salaam.

23:58.182 --> 23:59.215
Got him?

23:59.240 --> 24:00.675
We got him. He's back at work.

24:00.926 --> 24:02.261
Anything useful?

24:02.554 --> 24:04.122
Not yet.

24:08.793 --> 24:10.614
We caught this on a home-security cam.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.546
- We get a plate?
- We did.

24:12.571 --> 24:14.045
Tracked the car all the way to here.

24:14.070 --> 24:15.201
Two miles south of Epsom.

24:15.226 --> 24:16.265
And then?

24:16.290 --> 24:17.404
And then it disappears.

24:17.429 --> 24:18.464
Maybe they switched cars.

24:18.489 --> 24:20.191
Or changed plates.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.709
What are they doing?

24:24.894 --> 24:27.931
You can't do that. Hey!

25:20.732 --> 25:22.396
I'm unarmed.

25:23.513 --> 25:25.271
- Is he dead?
- He's dead,

25:25.296 --> 25:26.932
but I didn't kill him.

25:27.571 --> 25:29.206
He did it himself.

25:29.573 --> 25:31.043
I don't believe you.

25:31.214 --> 25:32.885
So don't believe me.

25:41.210 --> 25:42.813
Look at me.

25:45.469 --> 25:47.479
He came after my kids.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.500
My children.

25:53.283 --> 25:55.586
I mean, did you know about that?

25:56.767 --> 25:58.917
Were you okay with that?

26:05.722 --> 26:08.459
I saw them at The Section
removing the hard drives.

26:10.032 --> 26:11.869
They looked like Agency.

26:13.311 --> 26:15.007
They had that...

26:16.301 --> 26:18.337
arrogance, you know.

26:20.423 --> 26:22.859
Is this what you worked so hard for,

26:23.060 --> 26:25.329
made all those sacrifices for...

26:25.408 --> 26:27.089
to be their lapdogs?

26:28.969 --> 26:30.286
Don't tell me it doesn't piss you off.

26:30.311 --> 26:31.652
I saw you.

26:34.465 --> 26:36.660
It's over, Elliot.

26:37.588 --> 26:40.121
George knew it. You know it.

26:44.901 --> 26:46.970
Were you the contact for that flight?

26:48.431 --> 26:50.394
Was Ashkan Davoud on that plane?

26:52.255 --> 26:53.690
I don't know.

26:53.715 --> 26:56.518
Washington said they took him from Iran.

26:56.873 --> 26:58.776
Was he here all along?

27:04.000 --> 27:07.037
You know, right?

27:11.935 --> 27:13.404
I arranged the pickup.

27:13.529 --> 27:15.532
- That's all.
- From where?

27:17.426 --> 27:19.224
From where?

27:20.631 --> 27:22.526
147 Chartley Street.

27:23.887 --> 27:25.543
Next to the railway.

27:28.192 --> 27:29.600
Thank you.

27:55.078 --> 27:56.838
Ah. Salaam alaikum.

27:56.954 --> 27:58.656
<i>Wa alaikum as-salaam,</i> brother.
How can I help you?

27:58.836 --> 28:01.305
Uh, I'm looking for a friend of mine...

28:01.392 --> 28:03.290
Ashkan Davoud. Do you know him?

28:03.386 --> 28:05.592
- Sorry. No.
- Okay, thank you.

28:05.715 --> 28:07.284
No problem.

28:13.509 --> 28:15.387
All right, so, six hours out
from whatever the fuck.

28:15.412 --> 28:16.622
Operation Green Light is,

28:16.647 --> 28:18.250
and he's getting worked up
over stationery.

28:18.449 --> 28:19.922
We need to light a fire.

29:11.801 --> 29:12.958
We're on foot.

29:13.008 --> 29:14.938
Be at the border in about five hours.

29:52.768 --> 29:55.762
_

30:16.486 --> 30:17.666
They're in position.

30:17.749 --> 30:19.320
Tehran connection playing ball?

30:19.420 --> 30:21.256
Like he was one of us.

30:21.335 --> 30:23.538
Operation Green Light is all set.

30:28.355 --> 30:29.562
What is it?

30:29.663 --> 30:31.299
Surely there's another way.

30:33.967 --> 30:35.193
We're sending them off into the desert

30:35.217 --> 30:36.424
like goddamn heroes.

30:36.449 --> 30:38.260
That's exactly what they are.

30:38.539 --> 30:40.805
There's no other way
as effective as this.

30:40.935 --> 30:42.204
This goes right to the gut.

30:42.376 --> 30:43.534
We control the evidence.

30:43.559 --> 30:45.027
We can make it say anything we want.

30:45.059 --> 30:46.293
Evidence?

30:46.662 --> 30:48.716
War is built on emotion.

30:49.397 --> 30:51.185
You know that better than anyone.

30:51.366 --> 30:54.703
Facts are white noise.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.702
Hello, there. Sorry to interrupt.

31:08.673 --> 31:10.118
Do you know this man?

31:13.234 --> 31:16.437
Please, he's in trouble.
I'm trying to help him.

31:19.772 --> 31:21.274
You recognize him?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.833
I've seen him.

31:27.087 --> 31:28.233
He prays with Bijan.

31:28.356 --> 31:29.723
Bijan. Bijan who?

31:30.143 --> 31:31.293
Bijan Pouran.

31:32.063 --> 31:33.193
Do you know where I can find him?

31:34.189 --> 31:36.096
He lives on the Mozart Estate.

31:36.669 --> 31:38.238
Okay, thank you.

31:43.383 --> 31:44.928
Nice walk?

31:48.142 --> 31:49.403
Where'd you go?

31:49.756 --> 31:51.145
I've been in the archives.

31:51.471 --> 31:53.248
You've been at the river.

31:53.728 --> 31:55.015
We tracked your phone.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.618
I don't have to answer to you.

31:57.753 --> 31:58.766
No. No, you don't.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.659
Which is why I called
your chief's office.

32:04.932 --> 32:07.801
That is what you call him, isn't it?

32:08.090 --> 32:10.939
Your boss. The chief?

32:11.292 --> 32:13.601
They're coming down to talk to you.

32:14.662 --> 32:16.100
You do know the penalties

32:16.125 --> 32:19.187
for passing on classified intelligence?

32:19.941 --> 32:23.011
Maybe you and Snowden
can shack up in Moscow.

32:26.521 --> 32:27.851
Now...

32:28.449 --> 32:31.653
I'm gonna ask you this... just once.

32:33.735 --> 32:35.521
What were you doing?

32:37.468 --> 32:39.260
You know who Ashkam Davoud is?

32:39.292 --> 32:40.861
<i>The whistle blower. Yeah. Why?</i>

32:40.971 --> 32:43.379
Washington said they extracted
him from Iran, right?

32:43.463 --> 32:45.685
- Right.<i> -What if I can
prove they were lying?</i>

32:45.873 --> 32:47.860
<i>- Can you?</i>
- Not yet, but if I could?

32:47.954 --> 32:50.390
Then I could run with that. Definitely.

32:50.465 --> 32:52.234
Okay, thanks.

33:08.088 --> 33:10.031
Bijan Pouran?

33:10.357 --> 33:12.059
I'm not immigration.

33:12.492 --> 33:13.818
Not police.

33:15.229 --> 33:18.767
You can talk to me now,
or talk to them later.

33:26.893 --> 33:28.339
Excuse me.

33:28.955 --> 33:31.225
Sir, have you seen this man?

33:35.856 --> 33:37.685
He was here, wasn't he?

33:38.466 --> 33:40.203
Ashkam Davoud.

33:42.456 --> 33:44.407
They took him from London, didn't they?

33:44.717 --> 33:46.219
Not Iran.

33:47.566 --> 33:49.329
You're not in trouble, Bijan.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.599
I can help you.

33:52.020 --> 33:54.508
I can get you money, papers.

33:55.458 --> 33:56.938
Bijan...

33:57.298 --> 33:59.508
I just need you to confirm that.

34:01.041 --> 34:02.677
Then I can help you.

34:06.020 --> 34:07.728
Yes, he was here.

34:09.820 --> 34:11.210
Good.

34:12.322 --> 34:13.947
Thank you.

34:15.982 --> 34:17.717
It is? Uh... Oh. Sorry.

34:18.024 --> 34:18.992
Hi?

34:19.025 --> 34:20.967
Davoud was taken from London.

34:21.087 --> 34:22.489
I've got the proof.

34:22.569 --> 34:23.870
<i>I can bring it to you.</i>

34:23.956 --> 34:25.342
Just meet me in the usual place.

34:25.366 --> 34:26.493
<i>It hasn't been usual</i>

34:26.518 --> 34:28.063
for over ten years.

35:50.538 --> 35:53.321
You're telling me Max Easton

35:53.354 --> 35:54.721
just disappeared?

35:54.811 --> 35:56.391
Yes, sir.

35:57.504 --> 35:59.686
You people are fucking amateurs.

36:11.023 --> 36:12.272
Sorry, this just came in.

36:12.858 --> 36:14.557
Thanks.

36:17.832 --> 36:19.418
Shit.

36:25.125 --> 36:26.240
What now?

36:26.318 --> 36:28.235
- I think I might have something.
- Well?

36:28.275 --> 36:30.575
Yesterday, Olivia Clarke
slipped her tail.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.827
Max's ex-wife.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.796
And why am I only
hearing about this now?

36:35.830 --> 36:37.699
It wasn't processed correctly.

36:38.235 --> 36:39.400
Jesus.

36:39.611 --> 36:42.415
This place really is
a finely-tuned machine.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.202
Pull up her phone calls.

36:49.469 --> 36:51.117
Yes, sir.

37:15.803 --> 37:16.971
Atusa.

37:18.738 --> 37:19.874
You don't call me.

37:20.273 --> 37:22.309
Our friend is dead.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.112
<i>Are you there?</i>

37:26.673 --> 37:27.807
<i>Was it you?</i>

37:27.848 --> 37:29.384
Use your head.

37:29.544 --> 37:30.979
Why would we do that?

37:32.886 --> 37:35.560
<i>Are we still clear
on Operation Green Light?</i>

37:36.095 --> 37:37.225
Yes.

37:37.258 --> 37:38.945
Then we proceed.

37:39.539 --> 37:41.542
<i>You don't ever call me again.</i>

37:44.284 --> 37:45.720
Get a voice trace.

37:46.975 --> 37:48.161
Too faint.

37:48.269 --> 37:50.511
But it was American... it must be
the other end of the chain.

37:50.537 --> 37:53.040
Yeah, maybe, but it still
gives us nothing.

37:53.681 --> 37:55.243
Yeah?

37:55.362 --> 37:56.971
We have a problem.

37:58.357 --> 38:00.113
We have a sandstorm incoming.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.283
Going to make the landing site unsafe.

38:02.576 --> 38:03.685
How wide?

38:03.718 --> 38:05.971
It's localized, about two klicks across.

38:06.079 --> 38:07.251
Should we abort?

38:07.395 --> 38:09.230
Recon gave us two possible
landing sites.

38:09.255 --> 38:10.790
There's an area closer
to the power plant.

38:10.815 --> 38:11.817
Greater risk.

38:11.959 --> 38:14.227
And that airspace isn't cleared.

38:14.787 --> 38:16.246
Leave that to me.

38:29.075 --> 38:30.132
Now you're calling me?

38:30.157 --> 38:32.026
<i>I have no choice. Our bridge is gone.</i>

38:32.446 --> 38:34.175
We have a new landing site...

38:34.569 --> 38:36.735
<i>32, 38, 50 North.</i>

38:36.850 --> 38:38.118
<i>45, 25,</i>

38:38.151 --> 38:39.987
22 East. Repeat.

38:40.127 --> 38:43.057
<i>32, 38, 50 North.</i>

38:43.252 --> 38:46.632
<i>45, 25, 22 East.</i>

38:47.165 --> 38:49.755
0100. Confirm?

38:49.936 --> 38:51.271
Confirmed.

39:01.100 --> 39:03.670
Near the border, just
outside the town of Mehran.

39:03.829 --> 39:04.965
What's that?

39:07.233 --> 39:08.969
Some kind of installation.

39:11.998 --> 39:14.755
- The Alin power plant.
- All right, let's go.

39:22.315 --> 39:23.568
Hey.

39:34.941 --> 39:37.310
He used to fly his kite here.

39:38.881 --> 39:41.222
The yellow two-string with the red tail?

39:43.096 --> 39:45.532
He spent hours flying that thing.

39:48.923 --> 39:51.526
He was out here all winter
till his hands were numb.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.727
You were right here.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.430
The whole time.

39:55.562 --> 39:57.564
Wouldn't let him out of your sight.

40:05.597 --> 40:07.201
Where's this proof, then?

40:10.335 --> 40:11.546
It's gone.

40:15.557 --> 40:17.051
Every time I get a handle on this thing,

40:17.076 --> 40:19.344
it just... it slips through my fingers.

40:19.672 --> 40:21.875
Then why are you here?

40:26.760 --> 40:28.396
Can you run the story?

40:29.026 --> 40:30.786
Can you speak to your editor?
Would you do that for me?

40:30.811 --> 40:33.002
I tried. I already spoke to him.

40:33.027 --> 40:35.039
I told him I might have something.

40:35.064 --> 40:37.100
He wants corroboration, Max.

40:37.399 --> 40:38.855
He doesn't want alternative facts,

40:38.880 --> 40:40.882
- he wants the good old-fashioned ones.
- When?

40:41.107 --> 40:43.077
- When what?
- When did you speak to him?

40:43.109 --> 40:44.245
Yesterday.

40:45.578 --> 40:47.089
After you spoke to me?
After you left the house?

40:47.113 --> 40:48.482
Yes.

40:49.315 --> 40:51.152
Where, Liv? Where were you
when you spoke to him?

40:51.177 --> 40:52.745
While I was driving away... Oh, my God.

40:52.769 --> 40:54.871
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

40:54.902 --> 40:57.705
Sir? We have it. She called her editor

40:57.744 --> 40:59.980
three hours after she slipped the net.

41:00.053 --> 41:01.455
<i>Hi, Angus, it's Olivia.</i>

41:01.480 --> 41:03.333
<i>I've got something. Can I come in?</i>

41:05.140 --> 41:07.943
"'I don't much care where, ' said Alice.

41:08.391 --> 41:10.848
'Then it doesn't matter which
way you go.' said the Cat."

41:10.908 --> 41:13.673
"'So long as I get somewhere.'"

41:17.310 --> 41:20.030
- Where was she?
- Right here.

41:20.070 --> 41:21.689
Five miles from where the car was found.

41:21.714 --> 41:23.450
- Get a team down there.
- Yes, sir.

41:23.529 --> 41:25.765
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

41:43.818 --> 41:45.821
The garden of England.

41:54.581 --> 41:55.803
<i>Attendez.</i>

42:02.268 --> 42:03.940
<i>Where are you? Why
didn't you answer the phone?</i>

42:03.964 --> 42:05.460
I was putting the children to bed.

42:05.492 --> 42:07.620
<i>You need to take the girls, you
need to get out of there now.</i>

42:07.707 --> 42:09.309
- Max.<i>
- I'm on my way.</i>

42:09.374 --> 42:11.042
<i>Go to the woods behind the house,</i>

42:11.932 --> 42:14.733
<i>Head south. Anna.</i>

42:14.935 --> 42:16.608
- Someone's here.<i>
- Go.</i>

42:16.816 --> 42:17.784
Someone's here.

42:17.809 --> 42:19.163
<i>Go. Go, now!</i>

42:54.067 --> 42:55.732
<i>- Non! Mama!</i>
- Shh!

44:36.068 --> 44:38.639
No!

44:40.199 --> 44:42.618
Please, please.

44:42.935 --> 44:45.105
Please.

45:29.329 --> 45:30.788
Give me the gun.

45:32.439 --> 45:34.983
- I can't.
- Anna.

45:42.683 --> 45:44.152
We have to go.

45:44.245 --> 45:47.047
- We have to get going.
- I... I can't.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.449
I can't do it.

45:48.475 --> 45:50.044
You can.

45:51.972 --> 45:53.532
Anna, now.

45:53.828 --> 45:55.764
Understand? We have to go.

45:57.124 --> 45:59.093
Chloe, come on.

45:59.440 --> 46:00.984
Come on.

46:26.086 --> 46:27.687
All right, this'll do.

46:42.141 --> 46:44.327
Okay, change into your uniforms.

47:12.972 --> 47:15.175
The coordinates are right down there.

48:01.994 --> 48:03.297
Okay, you got five minutes.

48:03.907 --> 48:05.986
Prelims here.

48:06.307 --> 48:09.223
We'll take the rest
of the material to the lab.

48:52.312 --> 48:54.949
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking ambush.

49:03.769 --> 49:06.606
Get us back online, now!

49:36.290 --> 49:37.603
All right.

49:37.723 --> 49:39.322
Let's move out.

49:40.848 --> 49:42.543
He's American.

49:44.157 --> 49:45.796
He's American.

49:48.882 --> 49:50.851
Who were those people?

49:51.125 --> 49:53.451
What the fuck just happened?

49:58.946 --> 50:00.714
Quds Force.

50:02.009 --> 50:04.379
Iranian Revolutionary Guards.

50:53.373 --> 50:54.946
<i>U.S. Forces were fired upon</i>

50:54.971 --> 50:57.470
<i>by members of the
Iranian Revolutionary Guard.</i>

50:57.495 --> 51:00.040
<i>We can now confirm
none of our brave men and women</i>

51:00.065 --> 51:01.724
<i>have survived what appears to be</i>

51:01.749 --> 51:03.015
<i>an ambush by Iranian forces.</i>

51:03.040 --> 51:04.419
<i>They were apparently escorting</i>

51:04.443 --> 51:05.844
<i>a group of international scientists</i>

51:05.899 --> 51:07.761
<i>who were there to verify whether Tehran</i>

51:07.786 --> 51:09.489
<i>is in breach of the nuclear deal.</i>

51:16.515 --> 51:18.184
<i>I want to be very clear about this.</i>

51:18.249 --> 51:21.648
<i>Major Jordan Franklin
is a goddamn American hero.</i>

51:21.701 --> 51:24.027
<i>This cannot be allowed to stand.</i>

51:24.203 --> 51:27.006
<i>This cannot be allowed to go unanswered.</i>

51:27.227 --> 51:28.495
<i>We have to respond.</i>

51:28.816 --> 51:30.151
<i>A military response?</i>

51:30.176 --> 51:31.421
<i>If necessary, yes.</i>

51:31.446 --> 51:33.476
<i>Even if that means war?</i>

51:35.641 --> 51:37.800
<i>Even if that means war.</i>
