(♪♪♪)

01:57.991 --> 02:04.374
(♪♪♪)

02:08.919 --> 02:10.338
Well, you look beautiful.

02:10.420 --> 02:11.464
Thank you.

02:15.593 --> 02:16.636
What was that for?

02:16.719 --> 02:18.221
To remind you that
we're speaking at the conference

02:18.304 --> 02:19.848
in a few hours.

02:19.931 --> 02:20.890
Wait, that's today?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.892
What day did you think it was?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.352
I don't know, tomorrow.

02:24.435 --> 02:26.563
Look, I'm pretty sure
you can handle it without me.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.730
I've got a lot of work to do.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.525
I need to figure out
which trail has the best chances

02:30.608 --> 02:32.110
of us finding something and
right now.

02:32.192 --> 02:32.944
- It's not like--
- Glen, suck it up

02:33.027 --> 02:35.321
and get ready.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.948
If I do this one,
you have to promise

02:37.031 --> 02:39.075
I won't have to ever again.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.618
I promise.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.497
You know, I can always tell
when you're lying.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.665
We leave in an hour.

02:45.748 --> 02:47.125
Okay.

02:47.208 --> 02:57.218
(♪♪♪)

03:03.308 --> 03:04.851
Excuse me.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.187
Could you all ple--
could you all sign my dinosaur,

03:07.270 --> 03:08.228
- please?
- Yeah, sure.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.023
- Sure.
- Yeah.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.566
My son's a big fan,

03:11.649 --> 03:14.068
he watches
all your expedition videos.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.155
(Indistinct chatter)

03:19.532 --> 03:20.992
There you go.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.828
I'd like to find dinosaurs
and monsters with you when I--

03:23.912 --> 03:25.288
when I grow up.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.831
Hey, well, I look forward to
working with you,

03:26.915 --> 03:28.958
I think you're gonna make
a great monster hunter.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.543
- Thanks.
- Thank you, both.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.669
He's a little shy,

03:31.753 --> 03:33.504
but this means the world
to him.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.132
Well, thank you, guys,
for coming.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.258
Thank you.

03:37.341 --> 03:40.094
(Indistinct chatter)

03:40.178 --> 03:40.762
Where is he?

03:40.845 --> 03:43.640
We do not have much time.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.642
Hey guys, sorry, I'm late.
Uh, which room is it in?

03:45.725 --> 03:46.643
GLEN:
It's in room 4.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.144
We'll be on in about 15 minutes.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.812
Oh, it'll only take me a second
to set up.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.859
Now, I hope you're all having
a wonderful time.

03:54.942 --> 03:56.694
Well, it's going to get
even better.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.113
I'm sure that most
if not all of you have heard

03:59.197 --> 04:02.492
of our next speakers,
Glen Craven and Lily Lantz,

04:02.575 --> 04:03.952
who are here to discuss with us

04:04.035 --> 04:05.870
the details
of their latest endeavor.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.332
So please give a big round
of applause to Glen and Lily.

04:09.415 --> 04:12.418
(Applause)

04:16.297 --> 04:18.548
Thank you all so much
for being with us today.

04:18.632 --> 04:20.260
Now, I'm sure
you all are wondering

04:20.343 --> 04:21.928
where our next
research expedition

04:22.011 --> 04:23.805
is going to be.

04:23.888 --> 04:28.351
Aliens, strange lights,
people completely vanishing,

04:28.434 --> 04:30.144
monsters.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.648
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is Mount Adams.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.109
The mountain is most known
for its strange

04:36.192 --> 04:38.069
lights phenomenon.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.239
This is a still from a video
captured by a couple

04:41.322 --> 04:42.865
that went hiking
on the mountain.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.742
This man was driving
by the mountain

04:44.826 --> 04:46.452
when he saw that.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.998
This is a photo taken
by a farmer at dusk

04:50.081 --> 04:52.292
about an hour
after he saw the lights

04:52.375 --> 04:53.376
appear on the mountain.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.586
What's interesting
is people only report

04:55.670 --> 04:56.921
seeing these creatures

04:57.005 --> 04:59.340
after the red lights
have been sighted.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.217
Now of course,
there are a lot of theories

05:01.301 --> 05:04.595
which try to explain away
the lights and the creatures

05:04.679 --> 05:06.014
uh, which we will be covering
in our upcoming...

05:06.097 --> 05:07.849
...we've told you the stories
of eyewitnesses,

05:07.932 --> 05:09.726
we've showed you
the photographs,

05:09.809 --> 05:12.895
and now we are pretty much
out of time,

05:12.979 --> 05:15.732
but I think we can answer
at least one question.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.777
Uh, you in the front.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.363
When do you plan to start
and how long do you expect

05:22.447 --> 05:23.656
to stay on the mountain?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.910
Yes, well, actually uh,
we'll be leaving tomorrow

05:27.994 --> 05:30.413
and uh, we'll be up there
for three days.

05:30.496 --> 05:33.457
Uh, we'll be bringing cameras,
camera traps,

05:33.541 --> 05:36.919
anything to help us uh,
capture some footage and some-

05:37.003 --> 05:40.631
some good evidence of uh,
whatever's up there.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.674
Uh, by the way a shout out

05:41.758 --> 05:44.927
to our awesome
camera tech guy Blake,

05:45.011 --> 05:48.306
who will be joining us
along with a few other people.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.766
Hope that answers the question.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.018
I am so sorry,
but we are out of time.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.353
We'll be back at our booth
to answer

05:53.436 --> 05:55.021
any more of your questions.

05:55.104 --> 05:56.272
Thank you so much
for coming out

05:56.356 --> 05:58.107
and hearing us speak today.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.025
Thanks.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.028
(Applause)

06:02.111 --> 06:08.159
(♪♪♪)

06:08.242 --> 06:11.204
(Indistinct chatter)

06:11.287 --> 06:12.372
Did you enjoy today?

06:12.455 --> 06:14.540
Oh, yeah, definitely.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.836
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.547
Hey uh, my uncle practically
lives on Mount Adams.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.549
He could be your guide
if you guys want one.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.801
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.761
Alright uh, my name is Louis.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.388
Here's his name and number.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.806
Louis, thank you so much.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.932
Yep.

06:31.015 --> 06:31.933
Just tell him Louis sent you.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.101
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

06:33.183 --> 06:33.893
- Thank you so much, Louis.
- Yeah, no problem.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.437
- Thanks, Louis.
- Hi, guys.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.855
I look-- I really look forward
to reading your book.

06:37.939 --> 06:38.981
Oh, thank you so much.

06:39.065 --> 06:48.699
(♪♪♪)

06:48.783 --> 06:50.659
You okay?

06:50.743 --> 06:52.995
No, I still can't find a trail
that's opened,

06:53.079 --> 06:54.122
they're all closed off.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.998
Look, you have no access here,
no access here,

06:56.082 --> 06:57.207
they-- they're all closed.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.459
I think we're gonna be fine.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.919
Just give that guy a call.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.132
What guy?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.758
That guy's uncle that lives
next to the mountain.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.552
He said if we needed a guide,
that he'd help.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.765
Well, he's pretty much
our only shot at this point,

07:12.849 --> 07:15.768
so I'll just give him a call
tomorrow morning.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.061
Okay.

07:17.145 --> 07:27.697
(♪♪♪)

07:27.780 --> 07:31.075
But unless he actually
has access to the trails,

07:31.159 --> 07:32.284
there's no--

07:32.368 --> 07:33.411
(Grunting)

07:33.494 --> 07:34.579
No, I'm being serious.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.456
- We'll be fine.
- There's--

07:36.539 --> 07:38.082
Don't worry about it.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.041
(Chuckles)

07:39.125 --> 07:41.586
Oh, what would I ever do
without you?

07:41.669 --> 07:43.713
(Sighing)

07:43.796 --> 07:45.673
You'd be sad and alone.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.550
(Chuckling)

07:47.633 --> 07:49.051
Goodnight.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.470
Goodnight.

07:50.553 --> 08:00.438
(♪♪♪)

08:01.564 --> 08:04.567
(Whirring)

08:11.699 --> 08:12.742
Oh, hey guys.

08:12.825 --> 08:13.618
So where's the little guy?

08:13.701 --> 08:14.827
Is he comin', too?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.330
Yep uh, we have to go
to his house to pick him up

08:17.413 --> 08:21.125
and by the way,
his sister's coming, too.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.043
- Okay.
- Oh, okay.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.085
You guys might wanna hurry
though,

08:23.169 --> 08:24.629
they're not gonna be happy
that we're late.

08:28.883 --> 08:29.884
Alright,
you guys got everything?

08:29.967 --> 08:30.843
Yep, we'll see you there.

08:30.927 --> 08:32.220
See you there.

08:34.388 --> 08:44.398
(♪♪♪)

08:55.952 --> 08:56.953
Hey, Thomas.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.579
About time you pisspots
showed up.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.581
Come on, it's cool
to be fashionably late!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.124
Fashionable, my ass.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.584
That's what you call it.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.469
Can you do anything by yourself?

09:13.553 --> 09:15.054
I can, but I won't.

09:15.137 --> 09:25.147
(♪♪♪)

09:35.157 --> 09:36.033
(Grunting)

09:36.117 --> 09:37.618
Hey guys, uh,
whoever wants to shower

09:37.702 --> 09:38.953
should probably take one now.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.038
Nah, I'm good,
but it might be the last shower

09:41.122 --> 09:42.832
you ever take
before the aliens get you.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.875
- And why wouldn't they get you?
- Simple.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.752
Aliens would be like,
"Ew, what a smelly boy!",

09:46.836 --> 09:48.588
and then I'd just sit back,
and watch all you butt-clowns

09:48.671 --> 09:50.339
get snatched up into space.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.967
Um, I'll take my chances
with that, so...

09:54.343 --> 09:55.469
Hey, I'll take one with you,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.138
so we'll save water
for everybody.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.015
Okay, but you're not borrowing
my shampoos.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.891
Mm.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.311
Hey, anybody wanna take
a steamy hot shower with me?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.521
How about you,
Professor Peanut?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.024
Not in a million years.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.942
Oh, well, it's your loss.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.736
Yes, it is.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.494
Hey, I'm gonna go watch
the sunset, so--

10:20.578 --> 10:21.370
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.663
Okay, hang on,
I'll come with you.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.789
Uh, okay.

10:23.873 --> 10:33.883
(♪♪♪)

10:48.648 --> 10:51.651
(Phone ringing)

10:54.195 --> 10:55.988
(Grunting)

10:56.072 --> 10:58.449
BLAKE:
Hey, we got an interview
in 30 minutes.

11:03.537 --> 11:06.332
- (Grunting)
- Piss off.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.958
Oh, crap.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.508
Hey, we'll be back in an hour
or two, okay?

11:15.591 --> 11:15.966
Okay.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.968
Alright.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.389
Come on, get up,
we gotta go.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.182
Oh.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.855
Okay, so who's-- Richard first?

11:29.939 --> 11:31.607
Yes, Richard.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.650
(Indistinct speech)

11:32.733 --> 11:34.110
Yeah.

11:34.193 --> 11:44.203
(♪♪♪)

11:46.956 --> 11:48.249
(Knock on door)

11:52.878 --> 11:53.879
- Howdy folks.
- Hi.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.631
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.217
Hi.

12:03.764 --> 12:04.807
Oh, here, here.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.267
S-- sorry about the mess.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.770
Uh, I don't get visitors here
too often.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.772
N-- now you can make yourselves
to home, but-

12:11.856 --> 12:13.899
but not too much, huh?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.276
Hey, anybody want a drink?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.027
- Uh, I'm okay.
- No, no, I-- I'm good.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.487
I'll have a beer!

12:21.031 --> 12:22.700
- There you go.
- Thanks.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.035
8:00 a.m. in the morning, man
who likes beer.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.787
That's a man who knows
what's good for him.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.124
Hey, there's 24 beers in a case,
24 hours in a day.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.127
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.086
Oh.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.921
Yeah, uh.

12:36.005 --> 12:36.964
Put that right there,
and we should be all set.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.008
Okay.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.635
Are we almost ready
for the interview?

12:41.719 --> 12:43.471
- Yeah, we're set to go.
- GLEN: Cool.

12:43.554 --> 12:45.347
Alright, we are here today
with Richard Croos

12:45.431 --> 12:47.725
who lives next to the mountain
and he has some knowledge

12:47.808 --> 12:50.019
he'd like to share with us
regarding the mysterious

12:50.102 --> 12:52.813
alien phenomenon
surrounding Mount Adams.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.064
Richard, could you tell us
a little bit about

12:54.148 --> 12:55.399
your history here.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.693
Oh-ho, I've been here
all my life.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.029
My father actually bought
the farm a month

13:00.112 --> 13:02.072
before I was born.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.784
And what do you think about
all the UFO stories?

13:04.867 --> 13:08.245
Oh, there's lots of UFOs
and lights uh, around, they're--

13:08.329 --> 13:09.789
they're not harmful.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.332
It's-- it's what comes out
of the red

13:11.415 --> 13:13.501
that you have to worry about.

13:13.584 --> 13:18.047
Uh, the normal flying things
around the mountain are--

13:18.130 --> 13:19.048
are-- are not a problem.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.466
My father taught me
that the only time

13:20.549 --> 13:24.345
you have to worry is
if the lights are red,

13:24.428 --> 13:26.055
then you gotta get the hell
out of there.

13:26.138 --> 13:29.350
Do-- do the red lights
like attack people or...

13:29.433 --> 13:32.269
No, it's what comes out
of the red lights.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.189
Um, monsters or aliens
or something,

13:35.272 --> 13:38.692
they come out and they hang
around for a couple of nights.

13:38.776 --> 13:45.991
Oh, it-- they steal livestock,
sometimes people, but it's uh--

13:46.075 --> 13:49.745
it's somethin' that
we have to keep an eye on.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.331
Well, how often do people see
these red lights?

13:52.414 --> 13:55.084
Mm, depends on the time of year.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.710
Maybe once a year.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.088
That's once too often
for my mind.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.632
Uh, we-- we keep an eye on--
on it around here

14:01.715 --> 14:03.676
and call each other up
if anybody sees a red light

14:03.759 --> 14:05.511
up on that mountain.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.596
Uh, it's kinda like
a neighborhood watch--

14:07.680 --> 14:10.432
- (Chuckles)
- But for aliens.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.810
So has anybody like tried
to predict

14:12.893 --> 14:14.436
when the lights will appear?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.479
Oh, yeah.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.022
Yeah, I know somebody
who does that.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.983
Uh, he knows a lot more about it
than I do,

14:19.066 --> 14:20.442
anybody else for that matter.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.987
Oh, would-- would you be willing
to give us his contact info,

14:23.070 --> 14:24.196
so we can talk to him?

14:24.280 --> 14:25.281
Oh, of course.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.448
Uh, as a matter of fact
he's a neighbor mine,

14:26.532 --> 14:28.617
just lives a couple houses down.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.327
- That's great.
- Sure.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.455
Uh-- uh,
is there any other questions?

14:33.539 --> 14:34.957
I think I've given you
all I want

14:35.040 --> 14:37.960
for this docudramatary
or whatever it is.

14:38.043 --> 14:38.794
Uh, no, no.

14:38.878 --> 14:39.753
You've-- you've been great.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.338
This has been a good interview.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.673
Sure thing.

14:42.756 --> 14:43.549
Thanks.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.929
Thank you.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.222
Yeah.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.223
Okay.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.477
Yeah well, thanks again so much
for letting us interview you.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.437
Oh, yeah.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.439
No problem,
you seem like good people.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.690
Thank you again,
really appreciate it.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.942
Yes.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.152
Hey, and thanks for the beers.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.154
Hey, anytime, son.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.238
Hey.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.659
One piece of advice.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.786
Be careful.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.830
I don't know if you believe
in all this,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.957
but it sure as hell is real.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.794
Alright, I'll--
I'll remember that.

15:20.878 --> 15:30.888
(♪♪♪)

15:34.099 --> 15:35.601
So where to, boss?

15:35.684 --> 15:37.561
Let's go
to his neighbor's place,

15:37.645 --> 15:40.189
so let's see if he's home,
right down there.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.649
Alright, sounds like a plan.

15:41.732 --> 15:49.740
(♪♪♪)

16:01.418 --> 16:03.712
(Knock on door)

16:08.676 --> 16:10.761
- Hello.
- Hey.

16:10.844 --> 16:11.887
What can I do for you?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.639
We were sent here
by Richard Croos.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.140
Uh, he-- he said
you could help us find out

16:15.224 --> 16:17.017
when the lights on the mountain
will appear.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.018
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.103
- Come on in.
- Uh, thanks.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.813
Please.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.656
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.700
You guys are gonna love this.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.205
Okay.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.086
Okay, okay.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.797
These are predictions
when the light appear next.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.299
Um, what day is today?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.135
I believe it's the 2nd.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.431
Look at here.

16:55.514 --> 16:56.932
Sometime around tomorrow night
will be

16:57.016 --> 17:01.478
when the red lights appear
again, so um, saying m--

17:01.562 --> 17:04.897
uh, like probably
maybe 50% chance.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.483
Sounds like
it's worth a shot to me.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.359
Yeah, say would you like
to join us?

17:08.444 --> 17:09.694
We'd love to have you on board.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.571
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:11.655 --> 17:13.031
That'd be great.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.157
Do you know
where the ranger station

17:14.241 --> 17:16.617
- is off of Highway 141?
- Well, yes.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.537
- Of course, yes, I do.
- Perfect.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.789
That's where we're meeting
our guide before we head on up.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.624
Just be there at 2:00
this afternoon.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.626
Hey guys, we got an interview
to do in 15 minutes.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.627
- We gotta go to Debbie's house.
- Oh, right.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.630
Um, yeah, but we gotta run,

17:28.714 --> 17:33.969
but let's see,
here is my number,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.680
just in case you need
to call me.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.057
Okay, will do.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.808
- Thank you.
- Thanks again, Willie.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.685
Alright, you're welcome.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.228
- See you guys later.
- Thanks.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.521
Alright.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.627
- Okay, we're ready to go.
- Cool.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.587
I guess I'll start off
by asking

18:08.670 --> 18:11.173
what do you think is going on here at Mount Adams?

18:11.256 --> 18:13.509
Well, I'll tell you;
demonic activity,

18:13.592 --> 18:14.635
plain and simple.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.637
Care to explain
what you mean by that?

18:16.720 --> 18:19.264
I don't expect you all
to understand completely,

18:19.348 --> 18:21.475
but I do know somethin'
that'll help you understand

18:21.558 --> 18:22.768
a little bit more.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.193
"And I beheld another beast
coming up out of the earth,

18:31.276 --> 18:33.278
and he had two horns
like a lamb,

18:33.362 --> 18:37.324
and he spake as a dragon,
and he exerciseth all the power

18:37.407 --> 18:41.036
of the first beast before him
and causes the earth and them,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.664
which dwell therein
to worship the first beast,

18:43.747 --> 18:45.666
whose deadly wound was healed.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.959
And he doeth great wonders

18:47.042 --> 18:50.212
so that he maketh fire come down
from heaven on the earth

18:50.295 --> 18:51.672
in the sight of men."

18:53.674 --> 18:55.926
Now, do you understand
what I'm talking about?

18:56.009 --> 18:58.220
You mean the demons
are the monsters

18:58.303 --> 19:00.973
people see on the mountains
and the fire from heaven

19:01.056 --> 19:02.307
is supposed to be
the red lights?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.768
Yes, yes, you understand.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.895
Oh, and I've got another verse.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.690
Ephesians 6:12.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.406
"For we wrestle not
against flesh and blood

19:17.489 --> 19:20.117
but against principalities,
against powers,

19:20.200 --> 19:22.703
against the rulers
of the darkness of this world,

19:22.786 --> 19:26.331
against spiritual wickedness
in high places."

19:26.415 --> 19:28.834
Now, you can't tell me that
there's not a spiritual battle

19:28.917 --> 19:30.335
goin' on up there.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.715
Now, you said on the phone
that your daughter saw

19:34.798 --> 19:36.967
the creatures, too.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.928
They were demons.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.305
We saw three of them out there,

19:41.388 --> 19:45.309
just off of our tree sightline
and-- and the sun had just set,

19:45.392 --> 19:46.977
and I know that
they were demons.

19:47.060 --> 19:50.314
They had red glowing eyes
straight from hell.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.774
Is it alright if--
if we talk with her?

19:52.858 --> 19:53.901
DEBBIE:
With Ruby?

19:53.984 --> 19:56.528
Yes, she's outside taking care
of the animals.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.696
Come on.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.826
Hey guys, you must be
the demon hunter people.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.453
- Mmhmm.
- I'm Blake.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.829
Hey, I'm Glen.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.289
Hey, Lily.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.917
So um, your mom told us
that you saw the creatures.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.044
Like could you tell us exactly
what you saw?

20:12.127 --> 20:12.669
RUBY:
Yeah, sure.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.338
It was right out there.

20:14.421 --> 20:17.341
Uh, there were three of them,
running along the edge.

20:17.424 --> 20:18.926
These things were huge,
had red eyes.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.636
That's all I really remember.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.138
Ruby, is that the only time
you've seen the creatures?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.681
I wish it was, but no.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.266
They'd usually come around here

20:26.350 --> 20:29.269
when the red lights
would go off on the mountain.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.396
When-- when was the last time
you saw them?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.149
About a year ago
was the last time I saw them.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.400
I mean uh, they--
they must have done

20:35.484 --> 20:36.610
somethin' up on the mountain,

20:36.693 --> 20:39.029
'cause they were bringin'
trucks up there, bulldozers,

20:39.112 --> 20:40.489
they were haulin' everything
up there.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.698
I mean you still see
the red lights,

20:41.782 --> 20:44.660
but whatever they are,
don't come around here anymore.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.619
Oh, right.

20:45.702 --> 20:46.662
Yeah, uh, we--
we've gotta get back,

20:46.745 --> 20:48.330
I'm-- I'm sorry, but hey,
thank you so much

20:48.413 --> 20:49.456
- for letting us interview you.
- Oh.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.540
- Thank you, Ruby.
- Thanks.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.583
- No problem.
- Thank you, nice to meet you.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.459
And good luck in
whatever it is you're doin'.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.168
Nice to meet you.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.419
Thanks.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.724
(Door opens)

21:07.808 --> 21:08.767
Oh, hey!

21:08.850 --> 21:09.518
How'd it go?

21:09.601 --> 21:10.143
LILY:
Pretty well.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.103
- Good.
- Yeah.

21:11.186 --> 21:12.271
I thought it went good.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.272
Hey, I got a free beer.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.356
Everything good here?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.358
Yeah, Kim and Thomas should be
ready to go--

21:16.441 --> 21:17.943
(Kim screaming)

21:18.026 --> 21:23.448
(♪♪♪)

21:23.532 --> 21:24.283
Are you guys alright?

21:24.366 --> 21:25.325
(Screaming)

21:25.409 --> 21:27.286
Oh, uh--

21:27.369 --> 21:28.412
Welcome back.

21:28.495 --> 21:29.663
Surprise.

21:29.746 --> 21:30.622
Come on, really you guys?

21:30.706 --> 21:31.832
You should know better.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.041
Uh, surprise.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.459
Surprise what?

21:34.543 --> 21:35.752
That over there.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.839
- (Gasping)
- (Chuckling)

21:42.384 --> 21:44.177
You can't stay mad at me
forever.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.054
Yeah, Lily, forgiveness
is the key to moving on

21:46.138 --> 21:47.055
with your life.

21:47.139 --> 21:47.973
How true.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.433
We forgave you for being
a piece of--

21:49.516 --> 21:51.518
Okay, you guys are really
getting on my nerves.

21:51.601 --> 21:53.228
Uh-oh, somebody has nerves.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.771
Oh, the nerve of some people.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.897
Seriously, you guys?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.482
(Laughing)

21:57.566 --> 21:58.734
Hey, we're here.

21:58.817 --> 21:59.901
I noticed.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.113
(Birds chirping)

22:03.196 --> 22:06.199
(Vehicle whirring)

22:25.427 --> 22:27.804
Hi, I'm uh,
Chief Ranger Bill Jefferson.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.181
- Glen, right?
- Yep.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.016
We spoke to each other
on the phone?

22:31.099 --> 22:32.434
- Yeah, that's me.
- Lily.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
(Chuckles)

22:33.602 --> 22:36.521
This is uh, it's Blake,
camera guy and tech.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.565
- And uh, that's Candie.
- Hi.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.777
And uh, Thomas and Kim,
they're the assistants.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.278
Well, pleased to meet you all.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.821
(Sighing)

22:44.905 --> 22:48.241
So um, how about we get up
on that mountain?

22:48.325 --> 22:49.076
- Yeah.
- Yeah,

22:49.159 --> 22:50.660
we'll follow you on
up there.

22:50.744 --> 22:51.995
Sounds good.

22:52.079 --> 23:02.089
(♪♪♪)

23:32.119 --> 23:42.129
(♪♪♪)

24:15.996 --> 24:17.247
(Grunts)

24:27.716 --> 24:30.427
So uh, you know,
this is the uh closed-off trail

24:30.510 --> 24:32.095
that leads up around
the mountain

24:32.179 --> 24:33.555
eventually to the top.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.558
Believe this is the trail
you mentioned on the phone.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.268
Well, how are we supposed
to get up there

24:38.351 --> 24:39.269
if it's blocked off?

24:39.352 --> 24:40.604
You won't.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.813
Nobody's allowed up there.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.815
Uh, too many people
went missin',

24:43.899 --> 24:46.359
so four years ago
we decided to start closin'

24:46.443 --> 24:49.070
all the trails
that lead to the top.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.989
Are there any trails
that are still open?

24:51.072 --> 24:53.116
Only the ones around the base
of the mountain.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.868
(Sighing)

24:55.827 --> 24:57.579
I'll be right back.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.789
I thought you talked to him
about this.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.957
I did talk to the guy
about this.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.209
(Sighing)

25:07.506 --> 25:08.715
I can't believe
we came all the way out here

25:08.798 --> 25:10.300
- for this.
- It's okay.

25:10.383 --> 25:12.135
How much money do we have?

25:12.219 --> 25:15.764
You're not thinking about
bribing a forest ranger?

25:15.847 --> 25:16.431
Trust me.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.807
How much do we have?

25:17.891 --> 25:22.020
Um, I think about 500.

25:23.897 --> 25:24.940
Yeah, 500.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.900
I can't believe you brought
that much money.

25:26.983 --> 25:29.903
Well, I wanted to be prepared
in case we had an emergency.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.322
Well, this counts
as an emergency.

25:32.405 --> 25:33.281
Yeah, I suppose.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.950
(Sighing)

25:37.577 --> 25:38.703
This is the part
where she flashes him

25:38.787 --> 25:40.330
and he lets us go up there.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.665
(Scoffs)

25:46.086 --> 25:49.798
Hey, if you're willing to be
our guide on the trail,

25:49.881 --> 25:52.842
I'll give you $300 cash
right now.

25:54.135 --> 25:58.265
Um, look, if you--
you wanna pay for a tour guide

25:58.348 --> 26:00.725
to take you up there,
I can do that,

26:00.809 --> 26:02.686
but it'll cost you.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.770
400.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.524
Works for me.

26:07.607 --> 26:16.616
(♪♪♪)

26:16.700 --> 26:18.285
Works for me.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.287
I'll go grab my stuff
and we'll get goin'.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.289
Cool. Give us five minutes
to get ready.

26:22.372 --> 26:32.382
(♪♪♪)

26:35.010 --> 26:36.720
No, it's not safe.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.471
Look, you don't have to go.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.098
Nobody's forcin' you.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.061
Everything alright?

26:47.397 --> 26:51.693
Look, I'm sorry, I can't go.

26:51.776 --> 26:55.071
I thought we just stayin'
on the side of the road.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.781
It's not a smart idea to be
up there

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
if the light do come tonight.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.827
Well, but we--
we have to go up there,

27:00.910 --> 27:02.203
there's no clear shots
down here.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.497
We have to--
we have to film the lights.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.249
I know.

27:06.333 --> 27:07.626
I know but--

27:09.002 --> 27:10.920
Here, give me a radio,

27:11.004 --> 27:13.423
so I can stay in contact
with you.

27:13.506 --> 27:14.633
Here.

27:14.716 --> 27:17.052
Well, we'll give you a call
if anything goes wrong.

27:18.637 --> 27:19.721
Okay.

27:23.433 --> 27:24.851
Stay safe, okay?

27:24.934 --> 27:26.436
I will.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.563
Hey Bill, give me your keys.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.565
I'll drive the truck back
to the station.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.651
I'll come pick you up
when you're ready.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.069
Alright.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.528
(Grunts)

27:35.612 --> 27:45.622
(♪♪♪)

28:21.825 --> 28:23.827
I'm afraid
I'm gonna want my money back.

28:23.910 --> 28:24.911
Oh, no, no--

28:24.994 --> 28:25.829
Everything's fine.

28:25.912 --> 28:29.165
We just need to take a shortcut.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.458
Did he say "shortcut"?

28:30.542 --> 28:32.919
Are you absolutely sure
you know what you're doing?

28:33.002 --> 28:35.255
I mean have you ever even been
on this path?

28:35.338 --> 28:37.090
No, not exactly.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.135
I'm familiar with the map,
I do know where we're going.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.138
We'll just go on
through up here

28:43.221 --> 28:46.599
and uh,
it'll take us to the top.

28:46.683 --> 28:47.976
I promise.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.227
You better be right.

28:49.310 --> 28:59.404
(♪♪♪)

28:59.487 --> 29:00.530
A word?

29:04.033 --> 29:05.118
What's up?

29:05.201 --> 29:07.620
Look, I-- I don't think
it's a good idea to--

29:07.704 --> 29:10.373
Blake, it's not gonna kill us
to go off the trail, okay?

29:10.457 --> 29:11.499
It's fine.
As long as Bill knows

29:11.583 --> 29:13.585
what he's doing, it'll be okay.

29:13.668 --> 29:14.419
THOMAS:
Seriously?

29:14.502 --> 29:15.712
I could eat a bowl
of alphabet soup

29:15.795 --> 29:17.714
and crap out a statement
smarter than that.

29:17.797 --> 29:20.300
Look, all Ranger Turd-face
is gonna do is get us lost,

29:20.383 --> 29:22.302
so he can get the $400
for a blow-up doll.

29:22.385 --> 29:26.264
Look, I know what I'm doin',
alright?

29:26.347 --> 29:27.557
I've been
a chief forest ranger

29:27.640 --> 29:28.558
for 10 years.

29:28.641 --> 29:29.768
So why don't you just shut
the hell up

29:29.851 --> 29:31.936
- and let me do my job?
- Keep talkin'.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.231
Maybe someday you'll say
something intelligent.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.108
Hey guys, uh,
we're losing daylight,

29:37.192 --> 29:37.734
we need to move.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.194
Whatever.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.131
(Taking deep breaths)

30:00.215 --> 30:01.090
I'm sorry, I um--

30:01.174 --> 30:02.050
(Takes a deep breath)

30:02.133 --> 30:03.802
Just need to take a quick rest.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.094
Oh, I'll tell them to wait up.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.429
Oh, no, that's okay.

30:06.513 --> 30:10.058
Um, yeah, I can still see 'em,
so we can catch up.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.020
(Taking deep breaths)

30:14.103 --> 30:16.022
Are we really going all the way
to the top?

30:16.105 --> 30:17.273
Well, yes.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.067
Isn't this the romantic getaway
in the heart of nature

30:19.150 --> 30:20.193
that you always wanted?

30:20.276 --> 30:21.736
CANDIE:
Not exactly.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.071
Though, everywhere with you
always turns

30:23.154 --> 30:25.031
into a romantic getaway, so...

30:25.114 --> 30:26.533
(Laughing)

30:28.201 --> 30:29.994
I'll make it even more romantic
when we get to the top.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.287
Oh, I'm sure you will.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.080
(Chuckling)

30:32.163 --> 30:33.581
Here, hand me my backpack.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.171
Okay, let's--
let's get out of here.

30:40.255 --> 30:50.265
(♪♪♪)

30:57.522 --> 30:58.064
(Exclaims)

30:58.147 --> 30:59.315
Blake.

31:04.487 --> 31:06.281
(Yelling)

31:06.364 --> 31:07.115
Really?

31:07.198 --> 31:08.366
You guys.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.826
Glen told us to come back
and check on you.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.244
We're all waiting for you.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.537
Looks like
they're alright to me.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.496
Mission accomplished.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.290
- (Chuckling)
- Yep.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.708
I'm gonna kill you guys.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.959
Good luck with that.

31:18.042 --> 31:28.052
(♪♪♪)

31:30.138 --> 31:31.306
So how much further?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.891
Well, not much.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.685
I suggest we uh,
set up camp here.

31:35.768 --> 31:37.562
It's not much farther up
to the top.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.981
Okay, that sounds great to me.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.734
Blake, can you set up camp,
so uh, Glen and I can set up

31:42.817 --> 31:44.402
some cameras on the trees
around here?

31:44.485 --> 31:45.486
Yeah, no problem.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.822
Hey, Thomas, Kim,
could you help him out?

31:47.906 --> 31:48.823
- KIM: Yeah, sure.
- THOMAS: Sure.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.033
Thanks.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.788
Hey, how about right here?

31:55.872 --> 31:57.874
That way we can see
if anything comes close to camp.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.375
Oh, yeah, that'll work.

32:12.805 --> 32:13.556
There we go.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.433
Okay.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.395
(Taking deep breaths)

32:19.479 --> 32:27.403
You know, the lights
are probably just airplanes.

32:27.487 --> 32:29.197
Stop being such a pessimist.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.156
No, I'm being serious.

32:30.239 --> 32:34.243
Like I mean
do you honestly think that

32:34.327 --> 32:36.454
there's demons and aliens
up here?

32:36.537 --> 32:39.958
I mean not really, but I think
anything's possible.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.210
Well, I don't know.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.462
I think some things
are more possible than others.

32:52.470 --> 32:56.516
Okay, I got just one left.

32:56.599 --> 32:57.725
Oh, yes.

32:57.809 --> 32:58.476
Uh.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.394
Where do you want this one?

32:59.477 --> 33:00.311
Down that way.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.188
Alright, cool.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.860
(Grunting)

33:07.944 --> 33:17.954
(♪♪♪)

33:32.427 --> 33:34.887
No, no, you're shitting it
all up!

33:34.971 --> 33:36.848
Why don't you watch
your language, you little turd.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.683
Let me tell you about
a porcupine's balls.

33:38.766 --> 33:40.518
They're small
and they don't give a crap.

33:40.601 --> 33:41.769
Why don't you grow up?

33:41.853 --> 33:43.604
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
come on now, guys!

33:45.523 --> 33:47.567
Blake, do you have
all the camera stuff?

33:47.650 --> 33:49.402
We need to head up
before it gets too dark.

33:49.485 --> 33:50.862
Yeah, I'm all ready to go.

33:50.945 --> 33:51.863
Candie, do you have your shoes?

33:51.946 --> 33:53.114
Uh, they're right here,
I'll put 'em on.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.198
BLAKE:
Alright.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.410
Hey, Bill, you comin'?

33:57.493 --> 33:58.786
No, I'm good.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.872
You let me know
if you see anything, huh?

34:00.955 --> 34:02.457
Will do.

34:10.922 --> 34:13.551
Onward to battle
with the aliens!

34:13.634 --> 34:23.643
(♪♪♪)

35:06.020 --> 35:10.024
I'll now name this giant piece
of dirt "Titty Top Mountain".

35:14.445 --> 35:24.497
(♪♪♪)

35:24.580 --> 35:26.082
I'll set the camera up.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.254
Hey, look down there.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.345
Oh my God, are you filming?

35:39.428 --> 35:40.972
Yeah, I'm getting this.

35:41.055 --> 35:51.065
(♪♪♪)

36:05.079 --> 36:06.497
(Indistinct chatter)

36:06.581 --> 36:08.207
I can't believe it's on camera.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.917
I know.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.003
Oh my God, that footage
is gonna be amazing,

36:12.086 --> 36:13.004
I cannot wait to see it.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.505
We're gonna sell a lot of DVDs.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.215
I know, I'm so excited.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.341
(Chuckling)

36:17.425 --> 36:19.093
(Overlapping conversation)

36:19.177 --> 36:22.180
(Taking deep breaths)

36:25.183 --> 36:27.435
This is Bill's.

36:27.518 --> 36:30.688
(Taking deep breaths)

36:30.771 --> 36:32.565
Hey, Bill?

36:32.648 --> 36:34.025
Hey, Bill?

36:35.568 --> 36:37.695
Why would he go walking
in the mud?

36:37.778 --> 36:39.697
- (Gasping)
- KIM: Oh my God!

36:42.158 --> 36:43.743
That's blood.

36:43.826 --> 36:46.329
I'm calling 911.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.206
You guys,
I don't have any service.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.001
Lily, do you--
do you have the radio?

36:52.084 --> 36:52.919
Yeah.

36:53.002 --> 36:54.295
I mean we--
we should call Willie.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.922
- Here.
- Have him call the police.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.799
Oh my God.

36:58.883 --> 36:59.967
Okay.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.512
(Sniffling)

37:07.475 --> 37:08.851
Willie, can you hear me?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.269
This is Glen.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.980
WILLIE: (On radio)Hello?

37:13.064 --> 37:15.483
Hello?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.318
Willie, this is Glen.

37:17.401 --> 37:18.945
Can you hear me?

37:19.028 --> 37:20.238
WILLIE: (On radio)Hello?

37:20.321 --> 37:21.280
Willie, this is Glen.

37:21.364 --> 37:21.989
Can you hear me?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.991
We-- we can't find Bill.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.493
WILLIE: (On radio)Hello?

37:29.997 --> 37:31.707
(Sniffling)

37:31.791 --> 37:32.875
Okay.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.461
Alright, guys, we ne--
we need to go look for him.

37:35.544 --> 37:37.922
Well, you guys are the adults,
figure it out.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.799
Good luck and good night.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.467
Honestly, that's not a bad idea.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.928
We're not gonna find him
at this time of night, anyway.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.429
Yeah, I agree.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.515
Yeah, sounds good.

37:47.598 --> 37:48.516
Alright.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.850
Fine, we'll-- we'll--
we'll look for him

37:49.934 --> 37:51.269
in the morning.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.146
(Sighing)

37:55.356 --> 37:59.819
(Indistinct speech)

37:59.902 --> 38:09.912
(♪♪♪)

38:16.752 --> 38:18.546
There you go.

38:22.133 --> 38:26.012
So how much longer
do we have to uh, look for Bill?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.305
I'm not sure.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.806
We'll never find him,
'cause he's probably out stealing

38:28.889 --> 38:30.224
our cars I bet.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.851
Thomas, that's not funny.

38:31.934 --> 38:33.519
He's probably really hurt.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.026
I'm gonna go look for him.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.402
You wanna come?

38:41.485 --> 38:42.653
Yeah, sure.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.125
GLEN:
Hey, Bill!

39:02.214 --> 39:04.675
Hey, Bill!

39:04.759 --> 39:06.469
Bill!

39:14.518 --> 39:16.729
You know, we're dead
if we don't find him.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.272
Well, thanks for being positive.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.273
No, seriously.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.566
He's the only one
who knows his way back

39:20.649 --> 39:21.817
to the trail.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.361
Oh, I'm--
I'm sure we'll be fine,

39:23.444 --> 39:25.029
we'll find him.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.781
Oh, hold up,
I gotta water the trees.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.032
Alright.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.706
(Flies buzzing)

39:42.380 --> 39:43.547
Oh!

39:43.631 --> 39:44.173
Glen!

39:44.256 --> 39:45.341
Glen, come over here!

39:45.424 --> 39:46.717
I think I found something,
you need to see this!

39:53.224 --> 39:53.974
He's dead.

39:54.058 --> 39:55.518
Yeah, that-- that's him.

39:55.601 --> 39:56.936
We-- we gotta tell 'em.

39:57.019 --> 39:58.104
We gotta tell 'em.

39:58.187 --> 39:59.897
No, no, wait, wait!
Thomas, wait!

39:59.980 --> 40:10.199
(♪♪♪)

40:10.282 --> 40:11.200
He's dead!

40:11.283 --> 40:12.118
He's dead!

40:12.201 --> 40:14.161
- What?
- What?

40:14.245 --> 40:16.664
(Taking deep breaths)

40:16.747 --> 40:18.958
We found him.

40:19.041 --> 40:20.793
It looked like an animal attack
to me.

40:23.546 --> 40:26.090
Oh my gosh.

40:26.173 --> 40:29.635
So what-- what do we do now?

40:29.718 --> 40:32.263
I think we should pack up
and head back down.

40:32.346 --> 40:34.473
But Bill was the only one
who knew how to get back.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.058
We don't have a choice Kim,
okay?

40:36.142 --> 40:40.229
This is a closed-off zone,
nobody comes up here.

40:40.312 --> 40:41.439
She's-- she's right.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.773
If we're gonna try today
we need to leave

40:42.857 --> 40:44.316
as soon as we can.

40:44.400 --> 40:45.484
Okay.

40:45.568 --> 40:55.578
(♪♪♪)

41:13.929 --> 41:15.389
Are you okay?
We can take a break.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.141
I'm fine, sort of.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.483
(Sighing)

41:27.234 --> 41:28.819
Ow!

41:28.903 --> 41:29.778
What the hell was that?

41:29.862 --> 41:32.156
It looked like a bug!

41:32.239 --> 41:33.073
Wait, did you get stung?

41:33.157 --> 41:34.575
Sure feels like I did.

41:34.658 --> 41:45.503
(♪♪♪)

41:45.586 --> 41:47.421
BLAKE:
Hey guys, I found it.

41:53.427 --> 41:54.345
Blake, be careful

41:54.428 --> 41:55.804
I don't know
if we brought your EpiPen.

42:00.267 --> 42:02.520
Oh dang, that thing's nasty!

42:02.603 --> 42:03.229
LILY:
Let me look.

42:03.312 --> 42:06.023
CANDIE:
Be careful!

42:06.106 --> 42:07.441
Oh, mm.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.442
Get me a stick,
I wanna make sure

42:08.526 --> 42:10.653
it doesn't hurt anybody.

42:10.736 --> 42:13.239
Thomas lines up his bat
and focuses on the target.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.908
Look at that concentration
as he's getting ready.

42:15.991 --> 42:17.326
And he scores!

42:17.409 --> 42:19.620
Oh, that was disgusting.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.460
Everything going okay?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.963
Yeah, as far as I can tell.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.381
Does it feel any better?

42:30.464 --> 42:31.840
Uh, yeah, sort of.

42:31.924 --> 42:34.093
- You think you can walk?
- I can.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.554
It doesn't hurt that bad,
it just really stings.

42:36.637 --> 42:37.513
Okay.

42:37.596 --> 42:39.515
- (Sighing)
- Here, let me help.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.896
Thomas, get your backpack,
break's over.

42:58.409 --> 43:08.419
(♪♪♪)

43:25.019 --> 43:27.479
Lily, where's the trail?

43:27.563 --> 43:29.064
We've been walking all day.

43:30.733 --> 43:31.859
I don't know.

43:31.942 --> 43:32.901
What do you mean you don't know?

43:32.985 --> 43:35.029
It means I don't know.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.115
- Candie, we're lost.
- Don't-- don't say we're lost.

43:38.198 --> 43:48.208
(♪♪♪)

43:50.961 --> 43:52.838
We should probably find a place
to set up camp.

43:52.921 --> 43:54.131
I know.

44:01.221 --> 44:05.684
You know, we've still got
plenty of food, we've got water,

44:05.768 --> 44:10.773
we've got tents, sleeping bags,
I mean we'll be alright.

44:10.856 --> 44:11.857
Alright.

44:13.859 --> 44:16.320
I'll get a fire going,
that'll make you feel better.

44:16.403 --> 44:26.413
(♪♪♪)

44:45.891 --> 44:47.434
So since we're on the topic
of farms,

44:47.518 --> 44:49.186
I kinda had a question.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.730
If a cow laughed like really,
really hard

44:51.814 --> 44:53.148
would milk come out
of its nose?

44:53.232 --> 44:54.608
(Chuckling)

44:54.692 --> 44:55.442
What?

44:55.526 --> 44:56.902
I thought it made sense.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.071
Hey, I lived on a farm
and I can tell you

44:59.154 --> 45:00.155
that would never happen.

45:00.239 --> 45:01.365
(Chuckling)

45:01.448 --> 45:03.325
I visited a farm
for a school trip once

45:03.409 --> 45:04.910
and the teacher asked
the farmer,

45:04.993 --> 45:06.954
"So what's your favorite part
about bein' a farmer?"

45:07.037 --> 45:09.748
He says, "Gettin' down dirty
with all my hoes."

45:09.832 --> 45:11.125
CANDIE:
Oh my God.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.626
(Chuckles)

45:16.463 --> 45:19.049
Well, I think I'm ready
to hit the hay.

45:19.133 --> 45:19.967
No pun intended.

45:20.050 --> 45:22.261
(Chuckling)

45:22.344 --> 45:23.595
Same here.

45:23.679 --> 45:24.596
Me, too.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.473
Oh, how's your leg doin'?

45:26.557 --> 45:27.516
It's okay.

45:27.599 --> 45:29.226
Thanks for asking.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.437
Don't worry,
I killed that little sucker.

45:31.520 --> 45:33.355
Uh, believe me
it wasn't little.

45:33.439 --> 45:34.106
That was one--

45:34.189 --> 45:35.065
Oh!

45:35.149 --> 45:38.861

45:46.952 --> 45:47.911

Thomas, wake up.

48:22.232 --> 48:24.359
Did-- did we stay here
all night?

48:27.070 --> 48:28.989
Yeah.

48:29.072 --> 48:31.575
Guys, I had a really bad dream.

48:31.658 --> 48:34.202
Blake was talking about
something and then--

48:34.286 --> 48:35.621
That wasn't a dream.

48:37.205 --> 48:38.749
Blake and Candie.

48:45.797 --> 48:52.137
Guys, um, we're not gonna be
able to carry all this out.

48:53.430 --> 48:57.476
We need to sort out and bring
only the essential things.

48:57.559 --> 49:07.569
(♪♪♪)

49:37.599 --> 49:45.607
(♪♪♪)

49:49.111 --> 49:50.487
That's not looking good.

49:50.570 --> 49:52.155
There's nothing
I can do about it.

49:52.239 --> 49:54.199
Hey, Glen, her leg's looking
really bad.

49:54.282 --> 49:55.534
You need to fix it.

49:57.661 --> 49:58.870
Let's see.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.003
Y-- yeah, that's-- that's bad.

50:06.086 --> 50:09.464
Okay, uh, I need to change
the bandage.

50:09.548 --> 50:12.175
Um, let's-- let's find a place
where you can sit down.

50:34.197 --> 50:35.532
Okay.

50:50.964 --> 50:52.007
Yeah, that's--
that's really bad.

50:52.090 --> 50:56.470
Um, Lily, can you find me
a knife and a lighter?

50:56.553 --> 50:57.220
Yeah.

50:57.304 --> 50:58.305
No, I'm not gonna let you--

50:58.388 --> 50:59.639
No, no, no,
I'm not gonna cut off your leg,

50:59.723 --> 51:01.850
but there's a lot of pus
built up in there

51:01.933 --> 51:03.643
and we need to get it out.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.520
It'll hurt at first,
but I promise

51:05.604 --> 51:09.357
it'll feel a lot better
when it's done.

51:09.441 --> 51:10.692
Okay.

51:10.776 --> 51:13.653
As long as you don't cut off
my leg I'm fine.

51:13.737 --> 51:16.615
Is-- is this the only knife
we have?

51:16.698 --> 51:19.910
It's the only one I could find.

51:19.993 --> 51:21.036
Okay.

51:22.496 --> 51:23.997
(Sighing)

51:36.218 --> 51:38.261
You might wanna close your eyes
for this.

51:46.603 --> 51:47.813
(Kim grunting)

51:48.772 --> 51:50.690
Okay.

Alright.

52:02.077 --> 52:07.749
Um, worst part is over.

52:07.833 --> 52:10.085
Wasn't that bad.

52:10.168 --> 52:12.254
That was like a giant zit
on your leg.

52:12.337 --> 52:13.713
Shut up, that's gross.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.966
Well, it is gross.

52:16.049 --> 52:17.926
I don't think I can carry
my backpack.

52:18.009 --> 52:19.553
I'll-- I'll take it.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.807
Are you sure you can carry
two backpacks?

52:23.890 --> 52:27.811
Well, in that case,
I guess you'll take it then.

52:27.894 --> 52:31.606
Well, I guess I will.

52:31.690 --> 52:32.566
Let me know
if it gets too heavy

52:32.649 --> 52:34.276
and I'll take it for you.

52:34.359 --> 52:36.570
I'll definitely take you up
on that offer.

52:54.045 --> 53:01.052
(♪♪♪)

53:01.136 --> 53:04.264
I think we should stay here
tonight.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.807
Yeah, I mean this place
will work

53:05.891 --> 53:08.310
and at least we have
some protection behind us.

53:08.393 --> 53:09.311

Exactly.

53:55.232 --> 53:58.151
So how many more nights
are we gonna stay out here?

53:58.235 --> 54:01.446
This is the last night I hope.

54:01.529 --> 54:04.658
If not, how long
can we survive?

54:04.741 --> 54:09.204
Well, we're pretty much
out of food.

54:09.287 --> 54:12.666
Yeah, we have about
a day's worth of water.

54:12.749 --> 54:14.042
So basically, we're all--

54:14.125 --> 54:15.168
(Shushing)

54:15.252 --> 54:17.087
You need to stay positive.

54:17.170 --> 54:18.296
THOMAS:
Oh, okay.

54:18.380 --> 54:22.884
So instead of the glass being
99% empty, it's 1% full.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.761
Well, that's the spirit.

54:28.306 --> 54:30.809
Hey, I'm gonna keep watch
for a while

54:30.892 --> 54:32.727
if you wanna get some sleep.

54:32.811 --> 54:34.604
Okay, wake me when it's my turn.

I don't-- I don't think

I can't sleep now.

Um, it's-- it's 5:45 right now.

56:42.482 --> 56:46.569
So not too much longer
till sunrise.

56:46.653 --> 56:48.071
Well, that's good news.

56:48.154 --> 56:49.864
The only good news I want was,

56:49.948 --> 56:52.242
"Oh, hey,
this was just a bad dream."

56:52.325 --> 57:02.335
(♪♪♪)

57:27.110 --> 57:30.113
(Birds chirping)

57:45.295 --> 57:48.298
(Taking deep breaths)

57:59.309 --> 58:07.317
(♪♪♪)

58:07.400 --> 58:08.485
Glen!

58:08.568 --> 58:10.862
(Birds chirping)

58:10.945 --> 58:12.489
Lily!

58:12.572 --> 58:22.582
(♪♪♪)

59:04.082 --> 59:06.167
Glen, wake up.

59:08.628 --> 59:11.339
(Grunting)

59:28.523 --> 59:31.067
Oh my God, I can't move my leg.

59:31.150 --> 59:32.485
What do you mean?

59:32.569 --> 59:34.487
I can't feel my leg.

59:39.742 --> 59:42.787
(Taking deep breaths)

59:47.542 --> 59:48.543
Okay.

59:53.006 --> 59:56.301
Alright, I'm gonna take--
I'm gonna take your boot off.

59:56.384 --> 59:57.552
Okay.

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:09.939
Can you feel that?

1:00:10.023 --> 1:00:12.108
No, I can't feel anything.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:20.491
(Sighing)

1:00:20.575 --> 1:00:21.826
This is bad.

1:00:23.244 --> 1:00:24.621
Uh-- uh, can we build
a stretcher for her

1:00:24.704 --> 1:00:25.788
or something?

1:00:25.872 --> 1:00:28.875
No, that'll take too long.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:31.002
Uh, I'll just--
I'll just carry her.

1:00:32.670 --> 1:00:36.257
Guys, uh, okay, let's start--
let's start packing up.

1:00:36.341 --> 1:00:46.351
(♪♪♪)

1:01:01.824 --> 1:01:05.453
Okay, so this will be really,
really uncomfortable,

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:06.871
but just let me know

1:01:06.954 --> 1:01:09.582
if anything really
starts hurting.

1:01:09.666 --> 1:01:10.875
I will.

1:01:10.958 --> 1:01:12.043
Lily.

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:17.799
Just-- just lift her up
really, really slowly.

1:01:17.882 --> 1:01:18.633
Okay.

1:01:18.716 --> 1:01:19.509
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1:01:19.592 --> 1:01:20.593
Yeah.

1:01:22.011 --> 1:01:23.179
Okay.

1:01:28.601 --> 1:01:30.853
Hey, Thomas,
be sure to put out the fire.

1:01:30.937 --> 1:01:32.230
Yeah.

1:01:49.539 --> 1:01:59.549
(♪♪♪)

1:02:20.445 --> 1:02:24.115
Hey, could one of you guys
hand me some water?

1:02:24.198 --> 1:02:34.208
(♪♪♪)

1:02:41.090 --> 1:02:43.843
(Taking deep breaths)

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:49.515
You guys, she has a fever.

1:02:51.517 --> 1:02:53.978
Here, you need to drink that.

1:02:59.066 --> 1:03:01.569
Is she gonna be okay?

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:04.989
Well, we really need to get her
to a hospital.

1:03:05.072 --> 1:03:06.657
Okay, well, then we need
to move quickly.

1:03:06.741 --> 1:03:08.075
It can't be far.

1:03:09.577 --> 1:03:10.411
I-- I hope you're right,

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:13.664
but I mean
it's gonna be dark soon.

1:03:14.665 --> 1:03:20.171
Uh, Thomas, help me try to find
a campsite.

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:22.924
We'll be right back.

1:03:23.007 --> 1:03:24.050
Be safe.

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:34.143
(♪♪♪)

1:03:52.787 --> 1:03:56.541
Better find a darn good spot
or we're toast.

1:03:56.624 --> 1:03:59.377
Yeah, yeah.

1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:00.628
I know.

1:04:04.006 --> 1:04:06.300
God, I'm tired.

1:04:06.384 --> 1:04:08.803
(Sighing)

1:04:12.849 --> 1:04:17.019
I still can't believe
this is happening, you know?

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:22.066
This was just supposed
to be a simple documentary

1:04:22.149 --> 1:04:25.152
about all the nonsense
that people believe

1:04:25.236 --> 1:04:26.904
about this mountain.

1:04:28.823 --> 1:04:30.366
But no, no,
it just so happens that

1:04:30.449 --> 1:04:35.037
there are real monsters
and aliens out to kill us.

1:04:35.121 --> 1:04:38.249
Oh, and not to mention,
we're also completely lost

1:04:38.332 --> 1:04:41.794
in the wonderful world
of unprocessed paper.

1:04:44.046 --> 1:04:44.797
(Sighing)

1:04:44.881 --> 1:04:46.757
Do you or Lily have
any sort of plan

1:04:46.841 --> 1:04:50.177
that doesn't involve
the afterlife?

1:04:50.261 --> 1:04:55.099
GLEN:
Uh, Lily's smart.

1:04:55.182 --> 1:04:57.935
I'm-- I'm sure
she's figuring out something.

1:05:00.771 --> 1:05:04.942
We've been in some really
bad situations before.

1:05:05.026 --> 1:05:06.944
She always figures
somethin' out,

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:09.155
always comes up
with some kind of idea.

1:05:11.866 --> 1:05:13.951
Never-- never this bad though.

1:05:16.787 --> 1:05:20.666
If-- if I'd only known
the danger

1:05:20.750 --> 1:05:22.710
that I've put you and Kim in,

1:05:22.793 --> 1:05:26.130
I-- I never--
I never would have made

1:05:26.213 --> 1:05:28.049
this stupid documentary.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:33.930
Well, I'll just ask
for some extra college credit

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:36.766
when I get back.

1:05:36.849 --> 1:05:40.519
I mean I definitely had no idea

1:05:40.603 --> 1:05:45.024
that there was gonna be
real aliens up here.

1:05:45.107 --> 1:05:46.817
I mean you really
shouldn't be blaming yourself

1:05:46.901 --> 1:05:48.110
for this.

1:05:50.988 --> 1:05:54.909
Blake and Candie are dead,

1:05:54.992 --> 1:06:00.331
because I didn't take
this shit seriously enough

1:06:00.414 --> 1:06:02.917
to come prepared for the worst.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.878
They-- they trusted me to know

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:09.590
what we were getting
ourselves into,

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:13.302
I can never forgive myself
for what happened.

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:25.356
I swear I will do everything
I can to make sure

1:06:25.439 --> 1:06:29.235
that you and Kim
get back home safely.

1:06:32.154 --> 1:06:34.365
It's really not your fault.

1:06:36.575 --> 1:06:40.037
I know it's gonna take a while
for you to understand that

1:06:40.121 --> 1:06:42.331
and I know how you feel.

1:06:42.415 --> 1:06:43.833
I was the one
that convinced Kim

1:06:43.916 --> 1:06:46.752
that this was just gonna be
another camping trip.

1:06:48.879 --> 1:06:51.465
She didn't have to come,
but she insisted on going,

1:06:51.549 --> 1:06:56.804
because well, I'm a dumbass

1:06:56.887 --> 1:06:59.557
and I always find ways
to get into trouble.

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:06.022
She doesn't blame you at all
and neither do I.

1:07:06.105 --> 1:07:08.232
It's really all of our faults.

1:07:14.155 --> 1:07:18.075
You know, we better find a cave
or something

1:07:18.159 --> 1:07:20.619
or we're gonna have a little
different set of problems

1:07:20.703 --> 1:07:22.038
if you know what I mean.

1:07:23.622 --> 1:07:26.083
You think we can find somethin'
before it gets too dark?

1:07:28.335 --> 1:07:30.379
(Sighing)

1:07:30.463 --> 1:07:31.756
I don't know.

1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:39.388
I was gonna suggest
we should probably uh, split up

1:07:39.472 --> 1:07:45.019
and look, but I'm pretty sure
we would both get lost.

1:07:47.396 --> 1:07:50.191
Now, that's a deep thought.

1:07:50.274 --> 1:07:56.363
Getting lost while we're lost.

1:07:56.447 --> 1:07:59.116
It's like a lost inception.

1:08:02.578 --> 1:08:04.580
(Chuckling)

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:13.172
Are you ready to get movin'?

1:08:13.255 --> 1:08:15.633
I was just getting comfortable.

1:08:15.716 --> 1:08:17.885
So was I.

1:08:43.244 --> 1:08:44.620
Yo, Glen!

1:08:45.621 --> 1:08:49.041
Let's sharpen
our alien-fighting skills.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:52.961
Thomas, we don't have the time
for this.

1:08:53.045 --> 1:08:56.506
Die, alien scum!

1:08:56.590 --> 1:08:58.300
Thomas, I'm serious.

1:09:01.554 --> 1:09:06.058
My name
is Thomas Dingle McDingdong.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:08.269
You killed my father.

1:09:08.352 --> 1:09:10.312
Prepare to die.

1:09:13.023 --> 1:09:15.818
Okay, fine, you got it.

1:09:15.901 --> 1:09:17.819
(Grunting)

1:09:17.903 --> 1:09:28.330
(♪♪♪)

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:30.416
Glen! Stop! No!

1:09:30.499 --> 1:09:32.334
Glen?

1:09:32.417 --> 1:09:33.878
Glen, you okay?

1:09:36.880 --> 1:09:40.050
(Grunting)

1:09:42.344 --> 1:09:44.971
Glen!

1:09:45.055 --> 1:09:46.139
Glen.

1:09:46.223 --> 1:09:48.934
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1:09:49.018 --> 1:09:50.435
(Taking deep breaths)

1:09:50.519 --> 1:09:52.188
Find my-- find my glasses.

1:09:52.271 --> 1:09:53.189
Okay, alright.

1:09:53.272 --> 1:09:54.440
Alright, no problem.

1:10:00.279 --> 1:10:02.948
Here, I found them.

1:10:03.032 --> 1:10:04.200
Thank you.

1:10:05.993 --> 1:10:10.539
Uh, you-- you got--
you got somethin'...

1:10:10.623 --> 1:10:13.000
(Taking deep breaths)

1:10:13.083 --> 1:10:15.377
Ow, God, oh God.

1:10:15.460 --> 1:10:17.338
Oh, God, okay.

1:10:21.133 --> 1:10:23.677
(Grunting)

1:10:23.761 --> 1:10:24.887
Okay.

1:10:24.969 --> 1:10:27.973

1:10:30.059 --> 1:10:32.937
Okay.

1:10:33.020 --> 1:10:36.023
(Taking deep breaths)

1:10:43.112 --> 1:10:45.199
How're we gonna get back
up there?

1:10:46.407 --> 1:10:49.702
(Taking deep breaths)

1:10:49.787 --> 1:10:51.830
I don't know.

1:10:51.914 --> 1:10:55.251
I don't think-- I don't think
I could get back up.

1:10:57.419 --> 1:11:01.048
We're gonna-- we're gonna have
to find a way-- way around.

1:11:01.130 --> 1:11:03.092
W-- which way do you wanna go?

1:11:06.262 --> 1:11:08.555
(Grunting)

1:11:08.639 --> 1:11:10.099
Um--

1:11:10.182 --> 1:11:12.059
(Takes a deep breath)

1:11:12.142 --> 1:11:14.395
Probably-- probably that way.

1:11:14.478 --> 1:11:16.647
Alright.

1:11:16.730 --> 1:11:18.148

1:11:50.347 --> 1:11:53.434
Call me crazy, but is that
a cabin over there?

1:11:53.517 --> 1:11:55.144
Are you serious?

1:11:56.145 --> 1:11:59.148
(Taking deep breaths)

1:12:00.816 --> 1:12:02.359
- You see it?
- Yeah.

1:12:02.443 --> 1:12:04.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I-- I think I do.

1:12:06.572 --> 1:12:07.656
I'll--

1:12:07.740 --> 1:12:08.782
You gotta go tell the others
as fast as you can.

1:12:08.866 --> 1:12:10.826
- Okay, okay.

1:15:10.797 --> 1:15:12.716
I ain't goin' hungry tonight.

1:15:12.799 --> 1:15:14.927
Well, you know,
you have to share that.

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:16.428
What else is up there?

1:15:16.512 --> 1:15:18.013
Just stuff.

1:15:23.602 --> 1:15:24.811
What is it?

1:15:24.895 --> 1:15:30.817
Well, we got us a chicken noodle
and chili combo for only 2.99.

1:15:30.901 --> 1:15:31.860
What a deal.

1:15:31.943 --> 1:15:32.945
Oh yeah.

1:15:54.132 --> 1:15:56.425
How is it?

1:15:56.510 --> 1:15:57.719
Tastes pretty good.

1:16:19.866 --> 1:16:22.661
Here, have some soup.

1:16:22.744 --> 1:16:24.288
I can't eat.

1:16:30.460 --> 1:16:32.879
Here, how about some of this?

1:16:32.963 --> 1:16:34.965
KIM:
No, I don't feel good.

1:16:49.228 --> 1:16:50.314
Rest up.

1:16:50.397 --> 1:16:52.232
Tomorrow, we're getting out
of this dump for sure.

1:16:55.110 --> 1:17:00.490
Thomas, you have to promise me
that you'll leave tomorrow

1:17:00.574 --> 1:17:01.867
even if I can't.

1:17:01.950 --> 1:17:03.994
What?
No.

1:17:04.077 --> 1:17:07.664
I'm your big sister,
you have to do what I say.

1:17:07.748 --> 1:17:10.291
No, I'm not leaving you here.

1:17:10.375 --> 1:17:11.460

Don't do this, Kim.

1:18:13.855 --> 1:18:16.858
I'm not dead, stupid.

1:18:16.942 --> 1:18:19.236
Don't-- don't do that.

1:18:19.318 --> 1:18:21.822
I'm fine, I just need to sleep.

1:18:21.905 --> 1:18:24.032
Okay, I'll let you sleep.

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:36.712
Glen, you need to come see this.

1:18:36.795 --> 1:18:38.004
GLEN:
What is it?

1:18:42.175 --> 1:18:45.178
(Growling)

1:18:47.180 --> 1:18:49.057
What are we gonna do?

1:18:49.141 --> 1:18:50.058
I don't know.

1:18:50.142 --> 1:18:52.102
Well, hopefully they stay back.

1:18:57.023 --> 1:18:58.483
I don't see nothing.

1:18:58.567 --> 1:19:02.028
Well, they're--
they're out there.

1:19:02.112 --> 1:19:05.615
Well, I think
we should keep an eye out.

1:19:05.699 --> 1:19:07.200
I'll go first.

1:19:07.284 --> 1:19:10.704
Alright, well, wake one of us
up in an hour or two, okay?

1:19:10.787 --> 1:19:12.621
Don't fall asleep.

1:19:12.706 --> 1:19:13.790
Well, that kind of defeats
the purpose

1:19:13.874 --> 1:19:15.291
of keeping watch now, don't it?

1:19:15.375 --> 1:19:16.543
LILY:
Just sayin'.

1:19:16.626 --> 1:19:26.636
(♪♪♪)

1:19:34.644 --> 1:19:44.654
(♪♪♪)

1:20:09.805 --> 1:20:19.815

1:20:50.637 --> 1:21:00.647

1:21:28.466 --> 1:21:29.134
(Growling)

1:21:29.217 --> 1:21:30.260
Oh!

1:21:30.343 --> 1:21:38.602
(♪♪♪)

1:21:38.684 --> 1:21:42.147
We gotta make sure that window
stays boarded up.

1:21:42.230 --> 1:21:43.398
THOMAS:
Hey, guys.

1:21:43.481 --> 1:21:44.608
Yeah?

1:21:44.691 --> 1:21:47.027
Why don't we feed the--
whatever the heck they are?

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:48.236
Wait, feed it?

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:49.571
What-- what do you mean?

1:21:49.654 --> 1:21:51.364
Yeah, with lead.

1:21:53.282 --> 1:21:55.952
Huh, we got us another
boomstick right here.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:56.870
(Grunting)

1:22:23.271 --> 1:22:24.898
THOMAS:
And one for you.

1:22:31.279 --> 1:22:32.489
Any shells for this?

1:22:32.572 --> 1:22:34.157
THOMAS:
Yeah.

1:22:34.240 --> 1:22:35.450
Cool.

1:22:40.914 --> 1:22:50.924
(♪♪♪)

1:23:03.687 --> 1:23:05.730
Now this, I would have signed up for.

1:23:05.814 --> 1:23:15.740
(♪♪♪)

1:23:15.824 --> 1:23:18.201
(Growling)

1:23:36.219 --> 1:23:38.722
Okay, guys, get ready.

1:23:41.057 --> 1:23:42.142
(Gunshot)

1:23:42.225 --> 1:23:43.977
(Growls)

1:23:44.059 --> 1:23:45.770
(Gunshot)

1:23:50.275 --> 1:23:51.151
(Gunshot)

1:23:51.234 --> 1:23:52.652
(Growls)

1:23:52.736 --> 1:24:01.870
(♪♪♪)

1:24:01.952 --> 1:24:03.663
THOMAS:
Now, that's what I call
"hunting".

1:24:03.746 --> 1:24:05.040
Well, be careful how you aim,

1:24:05.123 --> 1:24:06.541
we can't afford
to waste bullets.

1:24:06.624 --> 1:24:08.501
Yeah, but we can't hold them off
forever.

1:24:08.585 --> 1:24:10.962
I think we scared 'em off.

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:12.338
I highly doubt that.

1:24:15.717 --> 1:24:17.177
Did you kill it?

1:24:17.260 --> 1:24:19.344
I wounded one.

1:24:19.429 --> 1:24:20.930
How many are out there?

1:24:21.014 --> 1:24:23.099
I saw three, but who knows?

1:24:28.021 --> 1:24:30.190
Did you sleep well?

1:24:30.273 --> 1:24:32.692
No, but I'm feeling better.

1:24:32.776 --> 1:24:34.568
Well, how's your leg?

1:24:34.652 --> 1:24:36.154
I think I can feel it now.

1:24:36.237 --> 1:24:37.072
LILY:
They're back.

1:24:37.155 --> 1:24:47.165
(♪♪♪)

1:24:58.300 --> 1:25:00.719
Where'd they go?

1:25:00.804 --> 1:25:02.138
GLEN:
I don't know.

1:25:06.851 --> 1:25:09.103
(Thudding and rumbling)

1:25:09.187 --> 1:25:11.314
(Growling)

1:25:11.397 --> 1:25:20.698
(♪♪♪)

1:25:20.782 --> 1:25:22.117
(Gunshot)

1:25:25.787 --> 1:25:27.705
Thomas,
give me another shell now!

1:25:33.837 --> 1:25:35.171
(Gunshot)

1:25:38.967 --> 1:25:41.761
(Grunting)

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:54.398
(♪♪♪)

1:26:07.996 --> 1:26:09.496
Are you alright?

1:26:09.581 --> 1:26:10.582
(Sobbing)

1:26:10.665 --> 1:26:12.125
I'm not.

1:26:13.751 --> 1:26:15.378
They keep breaking in.

1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:17.630
We're practically out of ammo.

1:26:21.885 --> 1:26:24.596
Blake and Candie are dead.

1:26:26.764 --> 1:26:28.975
And I don't want us
to end up like them.

1:26:29.058 --> 1:26:30.934
(Sobbing)

1:26:31.019 --> 1:26:32.687
You got us this far.

1:26:34.439 --> 1:26:36.900
We need to keep fighting.

1:26:36.983 --> 1:26:38.193
Fighting together.

1:26:38.276 --> 1:26:40.361
(Sniffling)

1:26:47.785 --> 1:26:50.288
What's important.

1:26:50.371 --> 1:26:54.166
What's really important is that
we have each other.

1:26:58.296 --> 1:27:00.089
I love you so much.

1:27:04.636 --> 1:27:07.013
What would I ever do
without you?

1:27:10.058 --> 1:27:12.101
You'd be sad and alone.

1:27:12.184 --> 1:27:22.195
(♪♪♪)

1:27:24.906 --> 1:27:27.951
THOMAS:
Uh, guys, you might wanna
look out the window.

1:27:35.291 --> 1:27:37.585
(Growling)

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:43.091
Alright, Thomas, you need
to get me some more ammo.

1:27:43.174 --> 1:27:45.510
About that,
there isn't any left.

1:27:47.303 --> 1:27:49.430
Okay, well, there's got to be
more around here.

1:27:49.514 --> 1:27:52.058
I already checked, but whatever
makes you feel better.

1:27:52.141 --> 1:27:54.434
Alright, well,
just help me look.

1:27:54.519 --> 1:28:04.529
(♪♪♪)

1:28:16.374 --> 1:28:19.294
LILY:
Hey guys, I found something.

1:28:19.377 --> 1:28:30.221
(♪♪♪)

1:28:30.305 --> 1:28:33.474
Whoever owned this cabin
must have been a serious hunter.

1:28:33.558 --> 1:28:35.309
Yeah, no kidding.

1:28:35.393 --> 1:28:36.978
Well, we can definitely
use those.

1:28:37.061 --> 1:28:37.728
Yeah.

1:28:37.812 --> 1:28:40.189
What is it?

1:28:40.273 --> 1:28:41.898
Oh, just another kinda
boomstick.

1:28:41.983 --> 1:28:44.110
Be careful with those.

1:28:44.193 --> 1:28:46.404
Oh, it's okay as long
as you don't drop it.

1:28:46.487 --> 1:28:53.995
(♪♪♪)

1:28:54.077 --> 1:28:57.707
You guys, we can't stay here
especially without ammo.

1:28:57.790 --> 1:29:00.335
This is what I think
we should do.

1:29:00.418 --> 1:29:02.670
Wait for it to get close,
light the dynamite,

1:29:02.754 --> 1:29:04.547
then get out as fast as we can.

1:29:04.630 --> 1:29:06.049
By the time it breaks in,
it should be ready to--

1:29:06.132 --> 1:29:07.550
Kaboom!

1:29:07.633 --> 1:29:09.802
Exactly.

1:29:09.886 --> 1:29:12.805
Well, sounds like it could work.

1:29:12.889 --> 1:29:14.474
Uh, guys,
I don't mean to be pushing,

1:29:14.557 --> 1:29:17.101
but we got like
T-minus 35 times

1:29:17.184 --> 1:29:18.728
whatever to get out of here.

1:29:18.811 --> 1:29:19.853
Get Kim to the door--

1:29:19.937 --> 1:29:21.064
- Alright.
- I'll get this one.

1:29:21.147 --> 1:29:31.157
(♪♪♪)

1:29:33.868 --> 1:29:35.452
(Growling)

1:29:35.536 --> 1:29:36.537
Get ready.

1:29:36.621 --> 1:29:46.630
(♪♪♪)

1:29:58.768 --> 1:30:00.395
Now!

1:30:00.478 --> 1:30:10.487
(♪♪♪)

1:30:22.583 --> 1:30:24.794
(Growling)

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:32.593
Do you think she lit it?

1:30:32.677 --> 1:30:33.636
Of course, I did.

1:30:33.719 --> 1:30:34.971
KIM:
Maybe it's a dud.

1:30:35.054 --> 1:30:36.556
(Growling)

1:30:36.639 --> 1:30:39.892
(Explosion)

1:30:39.976 --> 1:30:40.934
(Chuckling)

1:30:41.018 --> 1:30:42.270
I think we got it.

1:30:42.353 --> 1:30:43.353
(Chuckling)

1:30:44.814 --> 1:30:47.316
I'll admit for a moment there
I thought for sure

1:30:47.400 --> 1:30:49.318
- we were all dead.
- For a moment?

1:30:49.402 --> 1:30:50.862
I've been thinkin' that
since day one.

1:30:50.945 --> 1:30:52.447
I'm just glad it's over.

1:30:52.530 --> 1:30:54.490
Well, it's not over yet,
we're still lost.

1:30:54.574 --> 1:30:56.159
Okay, but it could be
a lot worse.

1:30:58.077 --> 1:31:00.538
Right, we need to get moving.

1:31:00.621 --> 1:31:01.539
(Taking deep breaths)

1:31:01.621 --> 1:31:03.458
Which way?

1:31:03.541 --> 1:31:04.834
Same way we've been going.

1:31:04.916 --> 1:31:14.927
(♪♪♪)

1:31:25.771 --> 1:31:28.191
I'm in love with a road.

1:31:28.273 --> 1:31:29.150
(Chuckling)

1:31:29.233 --> 1:31:31.110
Oh, I missed you!

1:31:31.193 --> 1:31:32.278
Here, take some of these.

1:31:32.361 --> 1:31:33.821
I got plenty more
where that came from.

1:31:33.905 --> 1:31:34.989
And now, we're rich.

1:31:35.072 --> 1:31:35.948
With happiness.

1:31:36.032 --> 1:31:37.200
(Chuckling)

1:31:37.282 --> 1:31:39.577
Um, which way do we walk now?

1:31:39.660 --> 1:31:41.871
I think
we just keep walking on down.

1:31:41.954 --> 1:31:45.333
Yeah, I've been wanting
to do that all day.

1:31:45.416 --> 1:31:47.001
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

1:31:47.084 --> 1:31:48.085
Okay.

1:31:48.169 --> 1:31:58.179
(♪♪♪)

1:32:19.992 --> 1:32:30.002
(♪♪♪)

1:33:00.032 --> 1:33:10.041
