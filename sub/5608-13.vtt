Get on the ground!

00:05.075 --> 00:06.575
Now! Get on the ground!

00:06.577 --> 00:08.042
No...
Open the register.

00:08.045 --> 00:09.378
Give me the cash.
Okay, okay, okay.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.445
GUNMAN:
Give me it!

00:10.447 --> 00:11.446
Get down!

00:11.448 --> 00:13.048
GUNMAN:
Open it!

00:13.050 --> 00:14.916
Open the register.
I'm going as fast as I can.

00:14.918 --> 00:16.218
Well, go a little faster!

00:16.219 --> 00:17.886
CASHIER:
I have a family...

00:17.888 --> 00:20.088
Yeah, well, I have a family,
too, okay? And I'm gonna

00:20.090 --> 00:22.424
count to three, and if that
cash register isn't open,

00:22.426 --> 00:24.760
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your head.

00:24.762 --> 00:26.128
One!

00:26.130 --> 00:27.129
CASHIER:
I'm trying, I'm trying.

00:27.131 --> 00:28.997
(screaming):
Don't shoot!

00:29.533 --> 00:30.532
Two!
Please...

00:30.534 --> 00:31.400
Jamie, look out!

00:44.014 --> 00:45.347
Okay...

00:45.349 --> 00:46.915
so...

00:46.917 --> 00:48.750
what went wrong
with this exercise?

00:48.752 --> 00:50.318
All due respect for the
new training guidelines,

00:50.320 --> 00:52.454
Sergeant Langley,
this was a must-shoot situation.

00:52.456 --> 00:54.056
But Janko didn't shoot,
did she?

00:54.058 --> 00:56.024
I had a better angle
to see everything.

00:56.026 --> 00:58.360
It was a no-win scenario.

00:58.362 --> 00:59.561
It happens.

00:59.563 --> 01:01.663
Sometimes we can't control
all the factors,

01:01.665 --> 01:03.799
but we <i> can</i> control ourselves.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.468
Janko, nice restraint.

01:06.470 --> 01:07.769
Reagan...

01:08.539 --> 01:10.338
...we got some work
ahead of us.

It's been a privilege

If there's a doctor
in the house,

Aw, thank you

02:06.930 --> 02:07.929
You're the best.

02:07.931 --> 02:08.964
Nah, that would be you, Tim.

02:08.966 --> 02:10.664

Sid!

02:10.667 --> 02:12.000
Congratulations, Tim.
You made it.

02:12.002 --> 02:13.702
Commissioner,

02:13.704 --> 02:15.604
Ms. Reagan,
good of you to attend.

02:15.606 --> 02:17.172
Wouldn't have missed it.
One of the longest

02:17.174 --> 02:19.174

02:19.176 --> 02:21.176
I would have stayed
a little bit longer

02:21.178 --> 02:22.310
if you let me...

02:22.312 --> 02:25.046
Mandatory retirement applies
to everyone, Tim.

02:25.048 --> 02:27.115
(whispering):
Except the commissioner.

02:28.452 --> 02:31.086
HENRY:
I hear you're going to Florida?

02:31.088 --> 02:33.455
Sunshine and golf courses,
that's all they got

02:33.457 --> 02:34.623
where I'm headed, Henry.

02:34.625 --> 02:35.624
You're welcome anytime.

02:35.626 --> 02:38.426
I never figured you
for a snowbird.

02:38.428 --> 02:39.961
Yeah, me neither.
I thought I'd stay in New York

02:39.963 --> 02:41.663
until they planted me
beneath it,

02:41.665 --> 02:43.331
but times have changed.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.267
And the winters aren't
getting any warmer.

02:45.269 --> 02:46.268
No, it's not the cold.

02:46.270 --> 02:47.869
I'm taking Amy away
from all of this.

02:47.871 --> 02:49.437
City's going to hell
in a hand basket.

02:50.741 --> 02:53.808
Well, we'll miss your head
and shoulders in the cause, Tim.

02:53.810 --> 02:55.610
It's a lost cause now.

02:55.612 --> 02:58.647
The good guys are the ones
getting chased out.

02:59.950 --> 03:02.751
I'm sure you're
in the minority thinking that.

03:02.753 --> 03:04.920
Ooh, I am in the minority,
you are right there.

03:04.922 --> 03:07.189
When I first came on the job,
and you were

03:07.191 --> 03:08.123
the boss of bosses?

03:08.125 --> 03:10.258
That was a totally
different time.

03:10.260 --> 03:13.128
We got a damn good commissioner
running the show now.

03:14.398 --> 03:17.599
But... he's a little too caught
up in politics and appeasement

03:17.601 --> 03:19.868
to take off the gloves
and do what needs doing,

03:19.870 --> 03:21.136
you ask me.

03:21.939 --> 03:24.105
Sounds like you needed
the change.

03:24.107 --> 03:26.341
Right.

03:27.144 --> 03:30.078
Thanks for your service,
Lieutenant.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.781
And don't let the door
hit you in the ass

03:32.783 --> 03:34.516

There's a push to improve

Let's get real.

04:39.049 --> 04:40.915
You have the potential
to do big things

04:40.917 --> 04:42.117
in this department,

04:42.119 --> 04:43.752
but being partnered
with a Reagan

04:43.754 --> 04:45.754
is holding you back.
Why is that?

04:45.756 --> 04:48.223
The PC can't afford
to be seen as favoring

04:48.225 --> 04:49.924
his son's partner.

04:49.926 --> 04:51.359
You need another hook.

There's nothing wrong

Yeah, doesn't
ring any bells.

Since when is that your criteria
for keeping a man on the job?

Since the man was one
of my father's favorites.

08:03.057 --> 08:05.190
And a very good man...
with a blind spot.

08:05.192 --> 08:06.458
So, what do we got?

08:06.460 --> 08:08.994
We're starting to get calls

Ah... Sid said
he's on his way up about that.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.200
He couldn't put it
in an e-mail?

08:15.202 --> 08:16.902
He said an e-mail wouldn't do.

08:19.506 --> 08:20.572
Hey.

08:20.574 --> 08:22.507
Those two shot on
the subway last night

08:22.509 --> 08:24.476
are still in
intensive care.

08:24.478 --> 08:26.011
But you didn't come up here
for that.

08:26.013 --> 08:28.180
Well, we're still piecing
some of this together,

08:28.182 --> 08:30.949
but apparently the first victim
was a lush worker with a record,

08:30.951 --> 08:32.851
robbing a passed
out drunk.

08:32.852 --> 08:35.020
He sliced open his
pocket with a razor,

08:35.022 --> 08:36.154
took his wallet.

08:36.155 --> 08:38.857
Witnesses say the drunk
woke up and shot him.

08:38.859 --> 08:40.726
And?
There was another kid

08:40.727 --> 08:42.794
close by-- he got shot as
well, but we don't know

08:42.796 --> 08:44.029
what his role was.

08:44.030 --> 08:45.597
But the first victim

08:45.599 --> 08:47.566
still had the
wallet on him.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.035
It was Tim Harrison's wallet.

08:52.539 --> 08:53.538
What?

08:53.540 --> 08:56.008

Were both shooting
victims black?

09:04.051 --> 09:05.183
Yeah.

09:05.185 --> 09:08.387
GARRETT: And the shooter
was white, and a cop.

09:08.389 --> 09:10.889
Did the witnesses identify Tim
as the shooter?

09:10.891 --> 09:12.991
They all picked his photo
from the array.

09:12.993 --> 09:15.427
And they said he fired again
when the perps scattered.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.795
Any idea where he is now?

09:16.797 --> 09:18.897
In the wind,
with a gun and no wallet.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.399
Friends, family?

09:20.401 --> 09:21.433
Canvassing everybody.
No hits yet.

09:21.435 --> 09:22.634
How do you want this to go?

09:22.636 --> 09:24.503
Tim was a decorated
and respected member

09:24.505 --> 09:25.871
of this department.

09:25.873 --> 09:28.173
He's entitled to the presumption
of innocence

09:28.175 --> 09:29.341
until proven otherwise.

09:29.343 --> 09:31.076
Witnesses saw him shooting up
a subway car.

09:31.078 --> 09:33.145
And we have a man
who has Tim's wallet.

09:33.147 --> 09:34.946
I don't think
Tim gave it to him.

09:34.948 --> 09:35.914
I'm just saying...

09:35.916 --> 09:37.849
Put out a picture
and a description.

09:37.851 --> 09:40.252
We're not trying him
right now,

09:40.254 --> 09:41.887
we're just trying
to find him.

09:46.126 --> 09:47.826
You want to tell me
what's really going on?

09:47.828 --> 09:49.494
I said I didn't want
to talk about it.

09:49.496 --> 09:51.496
Come on, you casually
say you saw a murder

09:51.498 --> 09:53.298
when you were ten-years-old,
and now you want to

09:53.300 --> 09:54.666
just drop it, just like that?

09:54.668 --> 09:55.767
Yeah.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.069
What, you gonna smack
me upside the head

09:57.071 --> 09:58.203
until I tell you?

09:58.205 --> 09:59.571
What happened?

09:59.573 --> 10:02.507
It was, like, 25 years ago.

10:02.509 --> 10:06.144
My mother sent me out to get
some milk from the bodega

10:06.146 --> 10:07.612
across the street and...

10:07.614 --> 10:10.682
I saw something
I wasn't supposed to see.

10:10.684 --> 10:13.452
You do realize that I'm
your partner, right, Baez?

10:13.454 --> 10:14.786
Come on.

10:15.622 --> 10:18.924
That guy we saw,
Octavio Nunez...

10:19.827 --> 10:22.561
(sighs)
...I saw him curb-stomping

10:22.563 --> 10:25.130
someone to death right
in the middle of the street.

10:25.132 --> 10:27.766
Someone you knew?

10:30.370 --> 10:31.937
A friend?

10:33.774 --> 10:37.042
A boy I liked.

10:37.044 --> 10:39.044
Everyone called him Gabo.

10:39.046 --> 10:41.246
He was the first person I knew

10:41.248 --> 10:43.849
who thought I could make it
out of the hood.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.684
And you saw him get killed.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.486
(sighs)

10:47.488 --> 10:48.954
Any idea why?

10:50.357 --> 10:52.557
You can't be the only witness.

10:52.559 --> 10:54.893
Other people were
looking out their windows,

10:54.895 --> 10:56.294
they're just too scared.

10:56.296 --> 10:57.863
Octavio was young,

10:57.865 --> 10:58.797
but he already had a rep

10:58.799 --> 11:00.165
as an enforcer
with the local crew.

11:00.167 --> 11:01.967
I was scared, too.

11:03.370 --> 11:08.006
I locked eyes with him,
and I never said anything.

11:08.008 --> 11:10.675
(sighs)

11:10.677 --> 11:12.644
So, he was never charged.

11:13.447 --> 11:16.281
He disappeared
about a month later,

11:16.283 --> 11:18.183
and no one ever
talked about it.

11:18.986 --> 11:20.252
Gabo's mother
put flowers

11:20.254 --> 11:21.386
on the spot where it happened

11:21.388 --> 11:24.089
every year until she died.

11:24.091 --> 11:26.057
Sorry.

11:27.394 --> 11:29.928
Well, you know, this Octavio guy
is back in the neighborhood.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.196
I mean, he must be up
to something.

11:31.198 --> 11:32.364
We can pinch him now.

11:32.366 --> 11:34.900
No, just-just let it go,
Danny, okay?

11:34.902 --> 11:36.835
I still have family
on that block.

11:36.837 --> 11:37.802
Come on, there's no statute

11:37.804 --> 11:39.638
of limitations on murder.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.440
I'm asking you
to let it go, okay?

11:42.442 --> 11:45.877
It's not your family
that still lives there.

11:52.119 --> 11:54.452
Okay, each team take one,

11:54.454 --> 11:55.620
pass them along.

11:58.058 --> 12:00.525
Lieutenant Harrison was a member
of this department,

12:00.527 --> 12:03.562
but right now we have to treat
him like any other armed perp.

12:03.564 --> 12:05.630
If you see him,
approach with caution,

12:05.632 --> 12:07.732
and request an 85 forthwith.

12:07.734 --> 12:10.802
Moving on, we're continuing
our training assignments.

12:10.804 --> 12:13.071
As most of you know, this
precinct is a testing ground

12:13.073 --> 12:15.440
for the new community
policing model.

12:15.442 --> 12:17.676
You'll each be getting turns
to ride with me.

12:17.678 --> 12:19.044
That's all for today.

12:19.046 --> 12:20.545
Roll call dismissed.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.082
Janko.

12:25.018 --> 12:26.351
You ready?

12:26.353 --> 12:28.553
Oh, I meant to tell
you before roll call

12:28.555 --> 12:30.322
I won't be
on patrol today.

12:31.158 --> 12:32.157
Everything all right?

12:32.159 --> 12:33.458
Yeah, I have a court
appearance tomorrow.

12:33.460 --> 12:34.659
I thought I mentioned it.

12:35.596 --> 12:38.563
ADA wants me in
for trial prep.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.333
All right, Reagan,

12:41.335 --> 12:43.435
looks like it's just
me and you.

12:43.437 --> 12:46.838
Janko, I'll catch you
next time.

12:50.377 --> 12:51.509
Talk to you later, okay?

12:51.511 --> 12:52.777
Sure.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.283
(phone ringing nearby)

13:01.855 --> 13:05.290
Reagan, you <i> are</i> looking
at my personnel file.

13:05.292 --> 13:06.491
I was not.

13:06.493 --> 13:07.892
I mean, I am,
but I'm just

13:07.894 --> 13:10.061
looking at places you used
to live, that's all.

13:10.063 --> 13:12.197
So you can get more information
on the murder I saw.

13:12.199 --> 13:14.299
I thought we agreed
to leave it alone.

13:14.301 --> 13:16.268
No, I didn't agree
to anything, okay?

13:16.270 --> 13:17.402
Murder's murder,

13:17.404 --> 13:18.570
and this Octavio guy's

13:18.572 --> 13:20.405
skated on half
a dozen as it is.

13:20.407 --> 13:21.406
Yeah, in Mexico.

13:21.408 --> 13:22.607
And now he's back
in town

13:22.609 --> 13:23.675
and he's trying
to go legit.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.343
Oh, so you've been
tracking him, too.

13:25.345 --> 13:26.344
Of course, I have.

13:26.346 --> 13:27.379
You think I haven't
been over this

13:27.381 --> 13:28.713
a million times
in my head?

13:28.715 --> 13:30.482
The only thing I know
is nobody becomes a cop

13:30.484 --> 13:32.617
to forget about witnessing
a homicide, okay?

13:32.619 --> 13:33.918
This thing is gonna haunt you

13:33.920 --> 13:35.420
until you put it down, Baez.

13:35.422 --> 13:38.323
Or until you put it down
and stop torturing me with it.

13:38.325 --> 13:39.624
You're torturing yourself.

13:39.626 --> 13:41.293
You know you're
down for this.

13:41.295 --> 13:43.628
Come on, let's nail
this son of a bitch.

13:46.533 --> 13:48.700
All right, I'm in.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.668
Good.

13:49.670 --> 13:50.502
You gonna let up on me now?

13:50.504 --> 13:52.170
Not a chance.

13:54.808 --> 13:55.940
Hey, uh,
w-what happened today?

13:55.942 --> 13:57.409
Why'd you duck your turn
with Langley?

13:57.411 --> 13:59.477
I told you I had
to get ready for court.

13:59.479 --> 14:01.179
Yeah, you guys went out
after training the other night.

14:01.181 --> 14:04.983
Did, uh, something happen?

14:04.985 --> 14:06.151
It doesn't matter.

14:06.153 --> 14:09.387
Eddie, Eddie.

14:09.389 --> 14:10.955
He try to put a move
on you or something?

14:10.957 --> 14:11.890
It's all good.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.091
I-I handled it.

14:13.093 --> 14:14.959
What'd he do?

14:14.961 --> 14:17.162
It was nothing.

14:17.164 --> 14:19.531
(inhales)

14:19.533 --> 14:21.166
Uh, he kissed me.

14:22.102 --> 14:23.668
We both had had a lot to drink

14:23.670 --> 14:25.670
and I was not...

14:25.672 --> 14:27.539
completely blameless.

14:27.541 --> 14:28.973
What are you telling me?

14:28.975 --> 14:31.042
Look, Jamie, I really
don't want this to get around,

14:31.044 --> 14:34.346
and I'd really like it
if you didn't say anything.

14:34.348 --> 14:36.448
Hey...

14:36.450 --> 14:37.582
He's your superior officer.

14:37.584 --> 14:38.483
You telling me you wanted this?

14:38.485 --> 14:39.884
Jamie, I can handle
my business.

14:39.886 --> 14:41.653
You need to stay
out of this, okay?

14:41.655 --> 14:43.154
Please.

14:43.156 --> 14:46.057
I'm sorry I said
anything to you.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.766
Go.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.634
Witnesses confirm
the second kid who got shot

14:56.636 --> 14:58.536
was just trying
to break up the robbery.

14:59.373 --> 15:01.039
Great.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.107
Still no sign of Tim.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.108
We're pinging his cell phone.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.776
We put an alert over NLETS

15:04.778 --> 15:06.344
to law enforcement nationwide.

15:06.346 --> 15:07.512
The guy's got no wallet.

15:07.514 --> 15:09.781
He must be reaching out
to friends, family.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.917
Turns out he's been separated
from his wife for over a year.

15:12.919 --> 15:15.653
Amy has not heard
a word from him.

15:15.655 --> 15:18.356
So, all that stuff
about heading south together

15:18.358 --> 15:20.525
was just wishful thinking.

15:20.527 --> 15:22.827
Boss, the Tim Harrison I knew,
apparently he's--

15:22.829 --> 15:24.095
I don't know--

15:24.097 --> 15:26.164
he just hasn't been himself
for awhile.

15:27.033 --> 15:29.134
Or maybe the self he really is,

15:29.136 --> 15:32.971
he kept a lid on
till last night.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.174
Point taken, sir.

15:36.176 --> 15:37.642
You've got a call
coming through.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.878
It's Lieutenant Harrison.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.479
I've got TARU
tracing it.

15:41.481 --> 15:42.914
(exhales)

15:42.916 --> 15:44.282
Thank you, Baker.

15:45.619 --> 15:47.152
Sit down.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.190
Tim.

15:52.192 --> 15:56.628
Don't bother tracing this call,
Frank.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.930
I'll be gone
before you get here.

15:58.932 --> 15:59.931
(sighs)

15:59.933 --> 16:01.900
You know you need
to turn yourself in.

16:01.902 --> 16:04.202
They were both good shootings,
Frank.

16:04.204 --> 16:05.537
The one black kid had a blade,

16:05.539 --> 16:06.671
the other was backing him up.

16:06.673 --> 16:08.006
I shot in self-defense.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.375
That's for a grand jury
to decide.

16:10.377 --> 16:12.410
You would have done the same
thing-- any cop would have.

16:12.412 --> 16:14.879
You will have your day in court,
you have my word.

16:14.881 --> 16:16.214
Your word?

16:16.216 --> 16:19.284
I served your father
with distinction for 20 years.

16:19.286 --> 16:20.919
You shipped me out
to Staten Island

16:20.921 --> 16:22.220
the day he left the building.

16:22.222 --> 16:24.088
This has got nothing to do
with that.

16:24.090 --> 16:26.124
Of course it does.
The city is going

16:26.126 --> 16:27.459
back to the wolves
'cause you tied the hands

16:27.461 --> 16:29.027
of the people that saved it.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.161
Tim,

16:30.163 --> 16:33.665
I am about an inch away
from having to attach

16:33.667 --> 16:35.967
"armed and dangerous"
to the bulletin

16:35.969 --> 16:37.869
with your name
and picture on it.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.671
Don't make me do that.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.406
Come in.

16:41.408 --> 16:43.408
Come home.

16:44.277 --> 16:46.144
I'll tell you what, Frank.

16:46.146 --> 16:47.512
You do what you have to do,

16:47.514 --> 16:49.981
'cause I'm gonna do
what I have to.

16:50.817 --> 16:52.750
(water splashing)

16:57.457 --> 16:58.990
We didn't get it.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.640
(siren wailing)

17:18.646 --> 17:19.778
MAN:
Hey, Maria.<i> ¿Qué pasa?</i>

17:19.780 --> 17:21.480
WOMAN:
<i>Hola, Maria. ¿Qué tal?</i>

17:21.482 --> 17:22.815
It's the street
I grew up on.

17:23.046 --> 17:25.012
Mm, also the street where
Gabo was murdered.

17:25.013 --> 17:27.013
Yeah, that was then,
this is now.

17:27.016 --> 17:28.148
You Detective Foster?

17:28.151 --> 17:29.817
You the guys called
about Octavio Nunez?

17:29.819 --> 17:31.385
Yeah, what's
the story here?

17:31.387 --> 17:34.055
It looks like an arson
and explosives job.

17:34.057 --> 17:36.590
Yeah, Octavio is moving his
drug profits into real estate.

17:36.592 --> 17:37.992
The building he
was trying to buy

17:37.994 --> 17:41.329
just happened to have
a gas explosion last night.

17:41.331 --> 17:43.130
Let me guess,
negotiations had stalled.

17:43.132 --> 17:45.232
Yeah, fire marshals said
it looks like the gas line

17:45.234 --> 17:46.467
was deliberately cut.

17:46.469 --> 17:48.836
The property will
sell for a song now.

17:48.838 --> 17:51.639
That's how Octavio rolls.

17:51.641 --> 17:53.607
Word is he stomped a boy
named Gabriel Montoya

17:53.609 --> 17:55.009
to death on this street.

17:55.011 --> 17:57.978
A couple dozen people
looking out their windows,

17:57.980 --> 17:59.747
no one said anything.

17:59.749 --> 18:01.248
DANNY:
Think anybody on the block

18:01.250 --> 18:02.616
will talk about what's
going on with him nowadays?

18:02.618 --> 18:04.885
(scoffs) Would you,
if you just saw

18:04.887 --> 18:07.555
one of your neighbor's
buildings blow up?

18:07.557 --> 18:08.889
Hey, you can't blame them.

18:08.891 --> 18:11.525
People got to live.

18:18.267 --> 18:20.768
The point of this training
is not to escalate

18:20.770 --> 18:22.436
little problems
into big problems

18:22.438 --> 18:24.004
for the sake
of running up numbers.

18:24.006 --> 18:25.639
No one needs
to get shot to death

18:25.641 --> 18:27.408
over driving
with a broken taillight.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.276
Isn't that just
common sense?

18:29.278 --> 18:32.913
If it was that common,
everyone would have it.

18:32.915 --> 18:34.915
What's up with you,
Reagan?

18:34.917 --> 18:36.250
You've had an attitude
all morning.

18:36.252 --> 18:38.486
Nothing, I'm just
focusing on the training.

18:38.488 --> 18:40.955
This to do with Janko?

18:40.957 --> 18:43.524
She say something to you?

18:43.526 --> 18:44.925
Why would she?

18:44.927 --> 18:46.861
I've seen how you are
with her at the precinct.

18:47.797 --> 18:49.163
You two just partners?

18:49.165 --> 18:51.098
Why do you want to know,
are you interested in her?

18:51.100 --> 18:52.566
You have first dibs?

18:52.568 --> 18:56.470
Hey, you know what,
we're partners.

18:56.472 --> 18:57.638
Otherwise...

18:57.640 --> 18:59.073
(chuckles)

18:59.075 --> 19:01.742
So, I heard you two had a
couple drinks the other night.

19:01.744 --> 19:03.177
She say anything
to you about that?

19:03.179 --> 19:04.445
Nah, I just heard

19:04.447 --> 19:07.281
it wasn't strictly about
the new training guidelines.

19:07.283 --> 19:09.183
She didn't seem to mind
too much.

19:09.185 --> 19:11.419
You don't see how that
could be a problem?

19:11.421 --> 19:12.653
(laughs):
Hey...

19:12.655 --> 19:14.755
if you got in there first,
I'll back off.

19:14.757 --> 19:17.992
Otherwise, you snooze,
you lose.

19:17.994 --> 19:20.594
Can't be jealous
of what you never had.

19:20.596 --> 19:23.964
You're not worried about getting
jammed up for harassment?

19:23.966 --> 19:25.399
Why am I feeling like
this is turning into

19:25.401 --> 19:27.368
an unfriendly
conversation?

19:27.370 --> 19:29.336
Just looking out
for my partner.

19:29.338 --> 19:31.939
Trust me,
she's a big girl.

19:39.282 --> 19:42.383
Yup, yeah, thanks for
the update, Sergeant.

19:42.385 --> 19:44.919
Yeah, yeah, you, too.
Bye now.

19:48.491 --> 19:49.957
That about Tim Harrison?

19:49.959 --> 19:52.059
Yeah.

19:52.061 --> 19:55.029
A few scattered sightings,
nothing confirmed.

19:55.031 --> 19:56.864
Why didn't you just ask me?

19:56.866 --> 19:58.766
What do you mean?

20:01.838 --> 20:03.270
Why are you using sources

20:03.272 --> 20:05.339
when the most informed source
there is

20:05.341 --> 20:07.508
lives in the same house
as you?

20:08.945 --> 20:11.045
Maybe I didn't want
to bother you.

20:11.047 --> 20:12.913
Oh, since when has that
ever stopped you?

20:12.915 --> 20:14.248
Look, I know you don't
like the man

20:14.250 --> 20:16.183
or care about
what happens to him.

20:16.185 --> 20:17.117
That's not true.

20:17.119 --> 20:18.185
Yes, it is.

20:18.187 --> 20:19.887
I liked him fine....

20:19.889 --> 20:21.722
once.

20:21.724 --> 20:23.724
I just didn't like
what he became.

20:23.726 --> 20:24.859
Which was?

20:24.861 --> 20:26.894
Oh, come on, Pop.

20:26.896 --> 20:28.896
We had this discussion years ago

20:28.898 --> 20:31.565
when I first transferred him
out to Staten Island,

20:31.567 --> 20:34.468
expressly because the population

20:34.470 --> 20:37.905
of Staten Island is 75% white.

20:37.907 --> 20:40.741
Well, you never put
it quite that way.

20:40.743 --> 20:43.043
Oh, sure I did,
you just didn't want to hear it.

20:43.045 --> 20:46.347
You saying I'm covering
for a bigot?

20:46.349 --> 20:49.083
No, I-I-I've always said Tim

20:49.085 --> 20:50.985
did a good job for you.

20:50.987 --> 20:55.656
I knew a Vice Squad detective
who walked home one night

20:55.658 --> 20:58.726
and found himself thinking
every woman he saw was a hooker.

21:00.129 --> 21:02.763
So, he put in for a transfer
the next day.

21:02.765 --> 21:04.265
Remember him?

21:04.267 --> 21:06.200
It didn't happen overnight.

21:06.202 --> 21:07.801
I thought about it for weeks.

21:07.803 --> 21:11.772
You caught yourself,
corrected yourself.

21:11.774 --> 21:13.641
Tim didn't,
so I did it for him.

21:13.643 --> 21:16.176
You think I looked
the other way?

21:16.178 --> 21:19.480
No, Pop,
I-I wouldn't think that.

21:19.482 --> 21:24.952
I think it was...
kind of... cumulative,

21:24.954 --> 21:27.721
and it came to a head
after you were gone.

21:27.723 --> 21:30.858
But I got to tell you,
when I had him...

21:30.860 --> 21:34.261
he was a hammer
and every black guy was a nail.

21:36.265 --> 21:37.798
There were complaints, sure,

21:37.800 --> 21:41.435
but Tim was a good cop,
mechanically.

21:41.437 --> 21:45.272
So, the bosses always found
a way to see it his way.

21:45.274 --> 21:47.241
He's innocent

21:47.243 --> 21:49.376
until proven
otherwise, Francis.

21:49.378 --> 21:50.878
I know that.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.614
Then say it like you mean it.

22:03.025 --> 22:05.025
TIM: She wants to see me--
just tell her I'm here.

22:05.027 --> 22:06.493
Tell Erin Reagan

22:06.495 --> 22:08.262
OFFICER: She's aware.
Tim Harrison is down here.

22:08.264 --> 22:10.264
OFFICER: Everything metal has to go
through the machine.

22:10.266 --> 22:12.800
Hey, Tim.
What's going on?

22:12.802 --> 22:14.969
Oh, I told these idiots
that I want to see you,

22:14.971 --> 22:17.104
and they want to search me
like I'm some kind of criminal.

22:17.106 --> 22:18.539
Okay, well, it's standard
operating procedure

22:18.541 --> 22:20.407
in the courthouse--
you know that, right?

22:20.409 --> 22:21.775
Come on.
Drop it!

22:21.777 --> 22:23.978
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Relax! Relax!

22:23.980 --> 22:25.579
Don't move!
Relax!

22:25.581 --> 22:26.747
Everyone, just take it easy!

22:26.749 --> 22:27.815
Shut up!

22:27.817 --> 22:29.183
ERIN:
Okay, take it easy.

22:29.185 --> 22:32.119
I want Henry down here
right now.

22:32.121 --> 22:34.221
Make it happen.

22:34.223 --> 22:35.222
Or what?

22:35.224 --> 22:37.091
I got no beef with you,
Ms. Reagan.

22:37.093 --> 22:38.692
Okay, but if you're down here,

22:38.694 --> 22:40.260
then you mean
to turn yourself in, right?

22:40.262 --> 22:41.562
Yeah, on my terms!

22:41.564 --> 22:43.764
Not on anybody else's!

22:43.766 --> 22:45.866
I didn't come down here
to beg for mercy!

22:45.868 --> 22:48.469
Tim, I promise
you will get due process.

22:48.471 --> 22:50.504
I am not gonna just take a plea

22:50.506 --> 22:52.406
and dummy up.

22:52.408 --> 22:54.942
My side of the story
needs to be told.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.377
Okay, okay.

22:56.379 --> 22:58.245
But if you force these
officers to shoot you

22:58.247 --> 23:00.848
you won't have the opportunity
to tell it, right?

23:00.850 --> 23:03.384
How did I get to be
the bad guy here?

23:03.386 --> 23:05.319
That's what I don't understand.

23:05.321 --> 23:07.655
I was one of the best
of the best.

23:07.657 --> 23:09.123
I know that.
We all know that.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.458
But you need
to put the gun down.

23:14.196 --> 23:16.030
Right now,
just put the gun down.

23:16.032 --> 23:18.666
I can't be locked up
with those animals!

23:18.668 --> 23:20.367
I was a New York City

23:20.369 --> 23:21.769
police officer!

23:21.771 --> 23:23.303
I deserve some respect!

23:23.305 --> 23:24.705
Now, you can
give me your word

23:24.707 --> 23:26.907
as Henry Reagan's
granddaughter

23:26.909 --> 23:28.742
you're gonna do the right thing.

23:28.744 --> 23:31.812
I give you my word.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.261
(handcuffs jingling)

24:06.338 --> 24:08.104
How you holding up?

24:09.808 --> 24:11.107
(clears throat)

24:11.109 --> 24:12.675
They're keeping out
of central booking for now,

24:12.677 --> 24:15.378
But I-I'm headed
for the belly of the beast.

24:17.349 --> 24:19.315
What are you hearing
from your granddaughter?

24:20.852 --> 24:22.152
You're in deep.

24:22.154 --> 24:24.687
You might have justification

24:24.689 --> 24:26.689
for the guy who robbed you,
but we have witnesses

24:26.691 --> 24:28.691
that say the other guy
was trying

24:28.693 --> 24:30.793
to intervene on your behalf.

24:30.795 --> 24:32.128
They were both in on it.

24:32.130 --> 24:33.429
Did you get a look at them?

24:33.431 --> 24:36.332
Tim, the other boy
doesn't have a record.

24:36.334 --> 24:37.934
Just means he never got caught.

24:37.936 --> 24:39.169
Come on, Henry.

24:39.171 --> 24:41.337
We both know
what these people are up to.

24:41.339 --> 24:44.474
This was a public service
shooting, end of story.

24:44.476 --> 24:47.977
You're not doing yourself
any favors talking that way.

24:47.979 --> 24:51.414
These could be
attempted murder charges.

24:51.416 --> 24:54.217
Not if there's still
justice left in the system.

24:54.219 --> 24:55.585
If you want my support,

24:55.587 --> 24:57.587
you're gonna have
to tell me the truth

24:57.589 --> 24:59.455
about what happened
that night.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.991
I feared for my life.

25:01.993 --> 25:03.259
Period.

25:03.261 --> 25:04.427
You'd had a lot to drink!

25:04.429 --> 25:05.929
That's got nothing
to do with anything.

25:05.931 --> 25:07.797
Can you look me
in the eye and say

25:07.799 --> 25:09.199
you didn't just see black

25:09.201 --> 25:11.167
and start shooting?

25:11.169 --> 25:13.036
I got to explain
this to you, Henry?

25:13.038 --> 25:13.937
Yeah, you do.

25:13.939 --> 25:16.039
I gave my life

25:16.041 --> 25:18.708
to this city
and the department!

25:18.710 --> 25:20.977
I sacrificed
both of my marriages

25:20.979 --> 25:24.113
and my relationship
with my kids to serve you!

25:24.115 --> 25:26.049
And your son!

25:26.051 --> 25:28.952
I left it all out
on the battlefield.

25:28.954 --> 25:30.820
Now I--

25:30.822 --> 25:32.522
I just want to go home.

25:32.524 --> 25:35.091
Did you panic because
you saw young black males?

25:35.093 --> 25:36.392
They don't make me panic.

25:36.394 --> 25:37.627
I can show you the medals.

25:37.629 --> 25:39.128
Did you shoot them
because you were certain

25:39.130 --> 25:40.597
that they'd kill you
if they didn't?

25:40.599 --> 25:42.799
I made a stand on that train.

25:42.801 --> 25:45.969
'Cause someone
had to say enough.

25:45.971 --> 25:48.037
I got nothing to apologize for!

25:48.039 --> 25:49.906
To you or to anyone.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.515
Every week I'm calling you.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.850
Come have dinner

26:00.852 --> 26:02.218
with your mother
and your sister.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.220
And now you show up
unannounced?

26:04.222 --> 26:05.788
What are you talking about?

26:05.790 --> 26:06.923
I call you all the time.

26:06.925 --> 26:09.626
And I'm here every other Friday.

26:09.628 --> 26:10.927
Today's not Friday.

26:10.929 --> 26:14.130
I was working around
the neighborhood.

26:14.132 --> 26:15.932
I thought I'd just drop by.
(chuckles)

26:15.934 --> 26:18.568
But you never
"just drop by."

26:18.570 --> 26:20.837
Ana.
No, no, Ma.

26:20.839 --> 26:22.138
She's always been squirrely.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.406
She's up to something.

26:23.408 --> 26:26.776
We're looking
into an old case,

26:26.778 --> 26:29.212
which might be connected
to a new one.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.949
Why don't I like
how that sounds?

26:32.951 --> 26:35.551
Do you remember
what happened with Gabo,<i> mami?</i>

26:35.553 --> 26:38.855
I thought we were never
gonna talk about that.

26:38.857 --> 26:41.291
Octavio Nunez is back in town.

26:41.293 --> 26:43.259
You know that, don't you?

26:43.261 --> 26:45.061
Of course I know that!

26:45.063 --> 26:46.596
Him and his brothers

26:46.598 --> 26:50.266
just bought two buildings
on the street.

26:50.268 --> 26:52.201
And probably half the people
that are living there

26:52.203 --> 26:54.671
are the same people who saw
what he did to Gabo that night.

26:54.673 --> 26:56.139
Yeah, and they kept
their mouths shut.

26:56.141 --> 26:58.308
Which is why
they're still alive.

26:58.310 --> 27:00.877
You know that other building
just happened to explode

27:00.879 --> 27:03.513
when the owner wouldn't
sell low to Octavio?

27:03.515 --> 27:05.481
Why you got to be
such a drama queen?

27:05.483 --> 27:08.084
<i>Mami,</i> I need you
to talk to those neighbors

27:08.086 --> 27:09.852
and get them
to open up about

27:09.854 --> 27:10.953
what they saw that night.

27:10.955 --> 27:13.256
If we pull together,
we can put him away.

27:13.258 --> 27:15.925
Maria, that was a long time ago.

27:15.927 --> 27:19.228
And your sister and I,
we still live here.

27:20.332 --> 27:22.265
I can help you find a new place.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.766
I don't want to move!

27:23.768 --> 27:25.835
This is where my life is.

27:25.837 --> 27:29.238
Overlooking a spot
where a boy was killed?

27:29.240 --> 27:32.975
How long are we gonna pretend
that it never happened?

27:32.977 --> 27:34.410
(exhales)

27:34.412 --> 27:35.812
Then you're selfish.

27:35.814 --> 27:37.080
What?

27:37.082 --> 27:38.748
You heard me.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.450
You want to go
after this Octavio,

27:40.452 --> 27:42.752
because your conscience
is bothering you?

27:42.754 --> 27:44.687
No, Ana, I'm a cop.

27:44.689 --> 27:47.423
Yeah, and you being a cop
got our brother killed.

27:48.927 --> 27:52.061
Her only son.

27:52.063 --> 27:53.696
That is not what happened.

27:53.698 --> 27:56.132
Haven't we lost enough already?

28:02.574 --> 28:04.374
Hey.

28:04.376 --> 28:06.576
Hey.

28:08.413 --> 28:10.012
Heard you had some static

28:10.014 --> 28:12.682
with Langley in the RMP.

28:12.684 --> 28:14.384
A lot of what he says
is right, you know?

28:14.386 --> 28:16.386
Yeah, well, I'm not
joining the fan club.

28:16.388 --> 28:18.488
And I think you should
resign your membership.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.790
You didn't get into it with him
because of me, did you?

28:20.792 --> 28:23.025
He asked me if I had
first dibs on you.

28:23.027 --> 28:24.360
Great.

28:24.362 --> 28:25.862
This isn't just about
what he did with you, Eddie.

28:25.864 --> 28:27.096
It's about the job.

28:27.098 --> 28:28.064
It doesn't sound that way.

28:28.066 --> 28:29.465
He abused his position with you.

28:29.467 --> 28:32.101
I keep telling you--
this wasn't some sex assault.

28:32.103 --> 28:33.636
It was just a mistake.

28:33.638 --> 28:35.505
Why can't you
just leave it alone?

28:35.507 --> 28:36.506
How far did it go?

28:36.508 --> 28:38.141
Do you want a play-by-play?

28:38.143 --> 28:39.776
Did you tell him to stop?

28:39.778 --> 28:41.477
I did.

28:41.479 --> 28:43.212
Just...

28:43.214 --> 28:44.847
not immediately.

28:47.452 --> 28:49.485
I'm not very proud of this,

28:49.487 --> 28:52.255
but it's not always clear
whose fault it is.

28:52.257 --> 28:53.923
Okay, well, you could be
lying back on his bed naked.

28:53.925 --> 28:55.491
If you tell him to stop,
he needs to stop.

28:55.493 --> 28:56.626
Well, it didn't go that far.

28:56.628 --> 28:58.561
Just only in your imagination.

28:58.563 --> 29:00.129
Well, you can stonewall this
all you want, Eddie,

29:00.131 --> 29:01.898
but you know what he did
is wrong, and you know

29:01.900 --> 29:03.599
that's it's probably happened
to other people.

29:03.601 --> 29:05.268
All right, I need to get going.

29:06.271 --> 29:08.805
My turn with Ray's coming up.

29:19.684 --> 29:22.919
So, what's the deal
with these bunny ears?

29:22.921 --> 29:25.154
Pop.

29:25.156 --> 29:26.422
What?
(Danny chuckles)

29:26.424 --> 29:28.458
Okay, what's this?
Well,

29:28.460 --> 29:30.793
when we were setting the table,
I overheard Pops and Grandpa

29:30.795 --> 29:32.128
talking about how
it's not like the old days,

29:32.130 --> 29:35.264
when you could just
use the bunny ears.

29:35.266 --> 29:36.499
(chuckles)

29:37.435 --> 29:39.068
You care to explain?

29:39.070 --> 29:40.970
It's a myth.
Never really happened.

29:40.972 --> 29:42.171
What was it?

29:43.007 --> 29:44.040
Well, the story goes
that back

29:44.042 --> 29:45.575
in the good old days,
if a perp

29:45.577 --> 29:48.744
wouldn't confess,
a detective would leave the room

29:48.746 --> 29:51.347
and then he'd come back
wearing a pair of bunny ears.

29:51.349 --> 29:52.582
And then he would beat

29:52.584 --> 29:55.351
the hell out of the perp
until he confessed.

29:55.353 --> 29:56.285
Why?

29:56.287 --> 29:57.820
So, in theory,

29:57.822 --> 30:00.790
when the perp was on the stand
and said, "A detective put on

30:00.792 --> 30:03.626
rabbit ears and beat me up,"
no one would believe him.

30:03.628 --> 30:04.861
That's awesome.
Yeah, well,

30:04.863 --> 30:06.529
we don't do it
that way anymore.

30:06.531 --> 30:08.030
Well, but maybe we should.

30:09.067 --> 30:10.566
Once in a while, you know,

30:10.568 --> 30:12.068
it might do some good.

30:12.070 --> 30:14.036
Unless you care
about the Bill of Rights.

30:14.038 --> 30:15.338
HENRY:
Look, the point is

30:15.340 --> 30:17.406
the police saved this city

30:17.408 --> 30:19.041
because they had
a freer hand.

30:19.043 --> 30:22.044
We had more than 2,200
murders in a year.

30:22.046 --> 30:23.679
Everyone forgets that.

30:23.681 --> 30:24.914
No one's forgotten that.

30:24.916 --> 30:26.249
But times change.

30:26.251 --> 30:27.450
Meaning?

30:27.452 --> 30:29.252
Meaning we do not have

30:29.254 --> 30:31.587
2,200 murders a year anymore.

30:31.589 --> 30:32.889
More like 300.

30:32.891 --> 30:34.590
And you don't need to
rule with an iron fist

30:34.592 --> 30:36.559
to issue a parking ticket.

30:36.561 --> 30:38.961
Yeah, but we weren't hired
to be social workers either.

30:38.963 --> 30:40.396
Some of this new training
is good, and some of it

30:40.398 --> 30:41.797
doesn't work out on the street.

30:41.799 --> 30:43.099
Well, some of it won't work.

30:43.101 --> 30:45.568
But the city
isn't a war zone anymore.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.069
No, but any car stop

30:47.071 --> 30:49.372
could have a gun
under the front seat.

30:49.374 --> 30:51.641
And you got to think that way
if you want to get home safe

30:51.643 --> 30:53.476
to your family.
Danny, can we not...

30:53.478 --> 30:56.078
Good luck getting the public
on your side with that attitude.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.315
It's easy for you to say,
up in your cushy office.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.885
Every day is a balancing act.

31:02.887 --> 31:04.587
But that's
what we signed up for.

31:04.589 --> 31:06.422
ERIN:
Here's what I know.

31:06.424 --> 31:09.492
You don't make cases with bunny
ears or blackjacks anymore.

31:09.494 --> 31:11.360
You make 'em by convincing
people to talk.

31:11.362 --> 31:12.428
Fair enough.

31:12.430 --> 31:13.863
That's true.
Well, I'd like

31:13.865 --> 31:16.499
to talk about somebody
passing those carrots down here.

31:16.501 --> 31:17.767
So now it's okay
to be a snitch?

31:17.769 --> 31:20.403
No. No. To report
a crime, yes.

31:20.405 --> 31:21.904
That's different.

31:21.906 --> 31:23.472
In fact,

31:23.474 --> 31:26.375
it's your duty as a citizen.

31:26.377 --> 31:29.779
Well, Sean took my earbuds last
week and never gave 'em back.

31:29.781 --> 31:30.980
What?

31:33.184 --> 31:34.984
Sean, as your lawyer,
I advise you to take the fifth

31:34.986 --> 31:36.819
and pass the potatoes, please.

31:42.694 --> 31:45.728
My partner witnessed a
murder out on the street

31:45.730 --> 31:46.862
when she was ten.

31:46.864 --> 31:48.965
We just spotted the
guy the other day.

31:48.967 --> 31:50.099
He got away with it?

31:50.101 --> 31:52.134
Yeah.
That's a hard case to make

31:52.136 --> 31:55.071
after all these years.
Any other witnesses?

31:55.073 --> 31:57.373
No. None were willing to
come forward, and she's afraid

31:57.375 --> 31:59.475
because her family still
lives in the neighborhood.

31:59.477 --> 32:00.943
Can you get him
on anything else?

32:00.945 --> 32:03.412
Well, he's trying
to take his business legit,

32:03.414 --> 32:05.214
but I'm sure
if I put my bunny ears on,

32:05.216 --> 32:06.649
I could come up with something.

32:06.651 --> 32:09.986
I'm sure you can find another
angle to use to hang him.

32:09.988 --> 32:11.954
Like when the Feds
got Al Capone...

32:11.956 --> 32:13.689
It was on tax evasion.

32:13.691 --> 32:16.459
Right, so look for the little
crimes that hide the big crimes.

32:16.461 --> 32:18.594
People don't change that much.

32:23.368 --> 32:24.600
♪ When I pull out, duck ♪

32:24.602 --> 32:26.102
♪ Recognize who the best out ♪

Yo.

32:43.721 --> 32:45.021
(music stops)

32:45.023 --> 32:47.056
(crowd shouting)

32:47.058 --> 32:49.659
Octavio Nunez.

32:49.661 --> 32:51.961
Octavio Nunez.

32:51.963 --> 32:53.963
You're under arrest.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.598
What's the charge?

32:55.600 --> 32:56.966
Unlawful eviction.

32:56.968 --> 32:59.101
Can't throw your tenants out
without proper notice.

32:59.103 --> 33:01.604
(laughter)

33:01.606 --> 33:02.638
Hey, Marco,

33:02.640 --> 33:03.873
what is this, a joke?

33:03.875 --> 33:05.875
No, I'm not joking.
I'm dead serious.

33:05.877 --> 33:07.209
Now get your ass up.

33:07.211 --> 33:09.211
Not you, jackass.
Sit down.

33:11.816 --> 33:12.848
No, you hold it right there.

33:12.850 --> 33:15.084
Hell to the no.

33:15.086 --> 33:16.352
It's not going
down like that.

33:16.354 --> 33:18.554
No way, no how.

33:18.556 --> 33:20.923
Oh, hell to the yeah,
it is, cowboy.

33:20.925 --> 33:23.259
Unless of course you want
to do this the hard way.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.365
Cowboy.

33:29.367 --> 33:32.201
What, are you gonna take out
your gun and shoot me?

33:33.104 --> 33:35.037
Like the cop on a train,
bang-bang?

33:36.774 --> 33:38.908
(shouting indistinctly)

33:38.910 --> 33:41.444
If I shoot you, you'd better
believe it'll be justified.

33:45.116 --> 33:46.615
<i>Damas y caballeros!</i>

33:46.617 --> 33:48.384
<i>Silencio!</i>

33:48.386 --> 33:49.785
Shut up!

33:50.922 --> 33:53.222
<i>Este hombre es un...</i>

33:53.224 --> 33:55.591
How do you say
"pedophile" in Spanish?

33:55.593 --> 33:56.892
<i>Pedofilo.</i>

33:56.894 --> 33:58.294
<i>...pedofilo!</i>

33:58.296 --> 34:00.663
(indistinct shouting in Spanish)

34:03.067 --> 34:04.767
Cuff him.

34:04.769 --> 34:08.437
Now, I know the rest of you
are all law-abiding citizens

34:08.438 --> 34:10.306
who don't violate children,
Let's go, move.

34:10.308 --> 34:12.274
so we'd appreciate it
if you'd step aside

34:12.275 --> 34:14.243
so we can escort
Mr. Nunez out of here.

34:14.245 --> 34:16.612
This is crazy,
and it'll never stand up.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.813
Of course it will.
Get him out of here.

34:18.815 --> 34:22.518
Ladies and gentlemen,
the New York Police Department

34:22.520 --> 34:24.120
would like to thank you
for your cooperation,

34:24.121 --> 34:26.789
and <i> Buenas noches.</i>

34:37.617 --> 34:38.949
Hey.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.585
Sergeant, thank you
for taking the time.

34:40.587 --> 34:41.953
I know you got
a lot on your plate.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.288
This better
be serious, Reagan.

34:43.290 --> 34:45.322
I was supposed to be home
a half hour ago.

34:45.324 --> 34:47.559
I got us a table inside.

34:47.561 --> 34:50.161
RAY: What's this
about, anyway?

34:50.163 --> 34:52.230
You said you wanted
to talk privately.

34:52.232 --> 34:53.764
Hey, Sergeant.

34:53.766 --> 34:55.867
Brenda.

34:57.103 --> 34:59.070
Officer Cropper.

34:59.072 --> 35:01.406
Long time no see.

35:01.408 --> 35:03.007
Right this way, Sergeant.

35:07.013 --> 35:08.680
Hi, Ray.

35:08.682 --> 35:09.981
What's up, Ray?

35:09.983 --> 35:13.084
Officers.

35:18.725 --> 35:20.558
Sergeant Langley.

35:22.129 --> 35:23.495
(chuckles)

35:23.497 --> 35:24.796
What's the deal here, Reagan?

35:24.798 --> 35:26.664
Why don't I give you
the seat with the view?

35:32.873 --> 35:35.940
All right, what are you
trying to pull?

35:35.942 --> 35:37.509
I'm not trying to pull anything.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.244
You pulled in all these women
I've worked with.

35:39.246 --> 35:40.478
Oh, you mean the "Ray-lettes"?

35:40.480 --> 35:42.380
The wha...? Who calls 'em that?

35:42.382 --> 35:44.182
That's what
they call themselves.

35:44.184 --> 35:45.683
See, because once
they all got to talking,

35:45.685 --> 35:48.319
they realized the one thing
that they had in common

35:48.321 --> 35:50.021
was that they all felt
they'd been pressured

35:50.023 --> 35:51.356
to let Ray have his way.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.624
You've been hitting on women

35:52.626 --> 35:54.058
in every precinct
where you've done training.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.227
I never forced myself on anyone.

35:56.229 --> 35:57.862
They all got
in the saddle willingly

35:57.864 --> 36:00.398
and enjoyed the ride
while it lasted.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.367
You were their training officer.

36:02.369 --> 36:04.269
You were out of line.

36:04.271 --> 36:05.537
I may not be
the perfect messenger,

36:05.539 --> 36:06.571
but I'm good at my job.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.106
Ask yourself.

36:08.108 --> 36:10.708
Are you trying to take me
down because I'm out of line

36:10.710 --> 36:12.911
or because you got
a thing for Janko?

36:12.913 --> 36:15.313
Officer Eddie Janko
is my partner,

36:15.315 --> 36:16.514
and that's all there is to it.

36:16.516 --> 36:19.050
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

36:20.954 --> 36:22.353
So what do you want from me?

36:22.355 --> 36:24.355
I'm thinking you should
put in for a transfer.

36:24.357 --> 36:27.625
I hear there's an opening...
on Staten Island.

36:27.627 --> 36:29.794
(scoffs)

36:37.470 --> 36:39.337
DANNY:
Come on.

36:39.339 --> 36:40.772
Stop staring. It's rude.

36:48.481 --> 36:49.781
Damn, son.

36:49.783 --> 36:51.115
You bring me in like this.

36:51.117 --> 36:52.550
An unlawful eviction.

36:52.552 --> 36:55.687
It's not even worth
my money to hire a lawyer.

36:55.689 --> 36:57.255
Couldn't agree with you more.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.524
Though we have other things
to talk about.

37:00.994 --> 37:02.393
You remember him?

37:02.395 --> 37:03.761
Nah, I don't know who that is.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.129
Okay.

37:05.131 --> 37:06.798
How about this?

37:06.800 --> 37:08.866
Maybe this will jog your memory.

37:08.868 --> 37:10.301
Is it supposed to?

37:10.303 --> 37:11.436
Yeah.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.271
It's Gabriel Montoya.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.807
You stomped him to death
in the middle of the street.

37:15.809 --> 37:17.508
Not me.

37:17.510 --> 37:19.811
Yeah, you.
Got a couple of dozen witnesses

37:19.813 --> 37:21.913
who watched you do it
from inside their apartments.

37:21.915 --> 37:23.248
Yeah?
Yeah.

37:23.250 --> 37:25.650
So how come I never
got locked up for it?

37:25.652 --> 37:27.418
Doesn't that seem
strange to you?

37:27.420 --> 37:30.355
Yeah, did seem strange to me.

37:30.357 --> 37:33.224
But then you made
the mistake of coming back.

37:33.226 --> 37:35.927
I'm a property owner doing
business in my old neighborhood.

37:35.929 --> 37:37.395
Ain't no law against that.

37:37.397 --> 37:39.764
You do realize people aren't
afraid of you anymore,

37:39.766 --> 37:41.699
and they will come forward now.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.437
And where are they?

37:46.439 --> 37:49.340
You talking about ancient
garbage nobody even cares about.

37:49.342 --> 37:50.375
Sit down.

37:50.377 --> 37:51.542
I'm calling your bluff.

37:51.544 --> 37:52.844
Sit down!

37:52.846 --> 37:55.079
Yeah, this is bullcrap.

37:55.081 --> 37:58.750
Unlawful eviction
is a misdemeanor.

37:58.752 --> 38:01.419
So give me your worthless
little summons and let me go.

38:01.421 --> 38:03.288
Can't do that.

38:03.290 --> 38:05.156
We're not finished yet.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.259
Look out now.

38:08.261 --> 38:10.461
Here comes
the heavy artillery.

38:12.766 --> 38:14.532
How you doing, shady lady?

38:14.534 --> 38:16.301
I didn't catch your name before.

38:19.973 --> 38:21.506
What about her?

38:23.109 --> 38:25.610
I never seen her before either.

38:27.113 --> 38:29.614
You're trying that
<i>pedofilo</i> business again, huh?

38:29.616 --> 38:30.948
It won't work.

38:30.950 --> 38:33.151
She's not a victim, Octavio.

38:33.153 --> 38:34.886
OCTAVIO:
Oh, yeah?

38:34.888 --> 38:37.322
Then who is she supposed to be?

38:38.358 --> 38:42.126
She's a witness who saw
what you did that night.

38:42.128 --> 38:43.828
(scoffs)

38:43.830 --> 38:45.163
She looked you right in the eye.

38:45.165 --> 38:47.198
I know you remember her.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.067
Take another look.

38:49.069 --> 38:50.301
(chuckles)

38:50.303 --> 38:51.402
Take another look!

38:51.404 --> 38:52.537
Look at the photo!

38:52.539 --> 38:54.706
Look at it!

38:54.708 --> 38:59.410
That girl grew up
to become a cop.

39:01.748 --> 39:04.515
Girl in the photo is me.

39:16.062 --> 39:18.229
(sighs)

39:20.033 --> 39:22.100
I asked building security
to bring him up.

39:22.102 --> 39:23.401
They're on the way.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.103
Did he make a scene?

39:25.105 --> 39:27.438
No, sir, but I told him
to take your private elevator,

39:27.440 --> 39:28.406
just to be safe.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.108
Thank you, Baker.

39:30.110 --> 39:31.976
He's here.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.779
Let's have him.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.154
Commissioner.

39:43.156 --> 39:45.022
Lieutenant.

39:49.396 --> 39:52.296
I understand you were in the
building without an appointment.

39:53.666 --> 39:55.600
Oh, I've got some fliers
here to distribute

39:55.602 --> 39:57.668
for my, uh,
legal defense fundraiser.

39:57.670 --> 39:59.937
I have asked Detective Baker

39:59.939 --> 40:02.373
to put together an appropriate
e-mail list for you.

40:02.375 --> 40:04.475
I think I'm more effective
face-to-face.

40:04.477 --> 40:05.610
This is police headquarters.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.513
We have a strict policy
about solicitations.

40:08.515 --> 40:10.014
I got a lot of friends here...
Who I'm sure

40:10.016 --> 40:12.250
would love to hear
about your cause.

40:12.252 --> 40:13.684
By e-mail.

40:13.686 --> 40:15.286
After 40 years
in the department,

40:15.288 --> 40:16.287
I think I have a right...

40:16.289 --> 40:17.955
You do not have the right

40:17.957 --> 40:19.857
to hand out fliers

40:19.859 --> 40:21.092
like it's Times Square.

40:21.094 --> 40:22.727
Period.

40:24.297 --> 40:25.563
You're even gonna try

40:25.565 --> 40:27.498
and derail me
getting a fair trial.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.367
No.

40:29.369 --> 40:31.035
Then what else is this?

40:31.037 --> 40:33.171
The way we do things here.

40:33.173 --> 40:34.505
Your way.

40:34.507 --> 40:37.675
(chuckles) As long
as I'm in this office, yeah.

40:39.245 --> 40:40.678
(sighs)

40:40.680 --> 40:43.915
Now, you are entitled
to a fair trial

40:43.917 --> 40:45.883
and I will do everything
in my power

40:45.885 --> 40:48.386
to make sure you have one.
Oh, you will, huh?

40:48.388 --> 40:50.588
Yeah.

40:52.058 --> 40:55.259
But I would hope you would
listen to a piece of advice.

40:56.963 --> 40:59.263
You can knock on every door
in this building

40:59.265 --> 41:02.266
and catch my people
at their most generous,

41:02.268 --> 41:05.770
but you will still only have
enough to pay a lawyer.

41:05.772 --> 41:09.040
Not the best lawyer,
just a lawyer.

41:09.042 --> 41:11.175
I got a damn good defense.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.710
Says you.

41:12.712 --> 41:14.412
Says a prosecutor--

41:14.414 --> 41:18.216
who will be the best
prosecutor the DA has--

41:18.218 --> 41:20.318
in this climate?

41:20.320 --> 41:22.587
Not so much.

41:22.589 --> 41:25.423
I'll take my chances.

41:28.094 --> 41:32.129
You shot a kid who was trying
to intervene on your behalf.

41:32.131 --> 41:34.599
A kid who's biggest jam
up to now

41:34.601 --> 41:36.033
was trying to decide between

41:36.035 --> 41:38.903
a full ride
to Iona or Fordham.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.173
And you shot him in a subway car

41:42.175 --> 41:44.475
full of witnesses.

41:44.477 --> 41:46.777
A full half of them black.

41:46.779 --> 41:48.713
Like him.

41:48.715 --> 41:51.516
You're not the judge
or the jury.

41:51.518 --> 41:53.851
The district attorney

41:53.853 --> 41:57.355
is going to make you
a generous offer.

41:57.357 --> 41:59.590
Take the plea.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.895
And you're not
my boss anymore, either.

42:05.865 --> 42:09.200
Well, it's just
a piece of advice.

42:09.202 --> 42:11.836
Not an order.

42:13.873 --> 42:16.307
Now...

42:16.309 --> 42:18.309
the police officer outside

42:18.311 --> 42:19.977
will escort you downstairs

42:19.979 --> 42:23.314
and out of this building.

42:23.316 --> 42:25.082
For the last time.

42:37.931 --> 42:38.931
