Being the Supreme
isn't something to wish for.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.649
It's not a gift. It's a burden.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.735

15:03.028 --> 15:04.738

the crushing responsibility of the coven.

15:08.242 --> 15:14.122
They all bowed under the weight,
except my mother, who ran from it.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.126

15:19.169 --> 15:21.046
