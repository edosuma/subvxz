Did James tell you
that his former attorney,

with his wife, Tasha?

00:18.486 --> 00:20.221
-Saxe.
-I'm afraid he di--

Before you answer that,
if you say yes,

00:22.156 --> 00:23.391
we can arrest him for murder.

called CourseCorrect.

<i>Machiavelli's</i> The Prince

06:28.021 --> 06:29.590

It's about
taking over a kingdom

06:30.991 --> 06:33.761
that was once occupied
by a great ruler

06:33.794 --> 06:35.095

It's about war, betrayal,
