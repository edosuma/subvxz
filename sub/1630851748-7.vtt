01:04.875 --> 01:07.583
That's what would happen
if we woke a hibernating bear.

01:07.666 --> 01:09.000
[slurping]

01:09.083 --> 01:10.291
Bears are evil.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.333
Not evil, animal.

01:12.416 --> 01:14.416
In nature, there's no moral code.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.875
I've seen hungry bears wake up early,
break into hibernating bear dens,

01:17.958 --> 01:20.250
kill the sleeping mother,
and devour her cubs.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.916
Bears eat other bears?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.750
Yep, especially the babies.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.541
[continues slurping]

01:25.625 --> 01:28.708
Anyhoo, I'm gonna go place a camera
in that bear den.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.083
Mmm.

[birds chirping]

Bonnie, is your gizmo linked up?

[beeping]

01:38.250 --> 01:39.333
Gizmo's good to go.

01:39.416 --> 01:41.916
If it goes pear-shaped in there,
you know what to do.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.875
Scream in horror?

01:42.958 --> 01:45.000
Sell your bones
to a voodoo queen in New Orleans?

01:45.083 --> 01:46.333
Exactly.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.250
[Dietrich] He's surprisingly nimble
for a big guy.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.833
[Bonnie] He does Pilates.

01:52.916 --> 01:54.250

01:58.958 --> 02:00.333
-[bats squeaking]
-Hmm.

02:02.416 --> 02:05.875
Just a little more
to the left, and… [grunts]

02:07.791 --> 02:10.125
-[slurping]
-Hmm.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.708

02:19.916 --> 02:22.458
Ugh! Jesus, Dietrich!
Enough with the milk already!

02:22.541 --> 02:24.750
The doctor said I have poor bone density.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.500
[breathing heavily]

02:31.291 --> 02:34.541
Seriously, who brings glass milk bottles
into the field?

02:34.625 --> 02:37.291
-Milk tastes better in glass. Oops.
-[bottle clinks]

02:39.208 --> 02:40.416

02:56.625 --> 03:00.458
Oh God, the fortune-teller was right!
We gotta get out of here!

03:00.541 --> 03:01.375
No, Dietrich!

03:01.458 --> 03:03.625
We can't just leave Uncle B
in there to die.

03:03.708 --> 03:04.708
[slurping]

03:04.791 --> 03:07.958
Didn't you listen to BTG's
unnecessarily graphic story?

03:08.041 --> 03:08.958
He knew the risks.

03:09.041 --> 03:11.125
-[bear growling]
-[BTG screaming]

03:11.708 --> 03:13.041

-[yelps]
-[bottles shattering]

03:18.250 --> 03:21.625
Dietrich, your stupid milk bag
hurt that little porcupine!

03:24.125 --> 03:26.583
Damn it, Dietrich,
we've lost too much today already.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.333
No porcupine left behind.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.041
-[grunts] Let's go!
-[Dietrich yelps]

03:30.125 --> 03:31.291
[bottle shattering]

03:31.375 --> 03:33.000
Can you actually fly this thing?

03:33.083 --> 03:35.416
If we're not dead in 30 seconds, then yes.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.500
[chopper powering up]

03:40.791 --> 03:42.208
[Dietrich] Oh, mother…

03:43.875 --> 03:45.166
Zombie!

03:45.250 --> 03:47.250
[Bonnie] Oh! Uncle B! You're alive!

03:47.791 --> 03:49.333
[roaring]

03:49.416 --> 03:51.916
[laughing] See you next winter!

03:54.791 --> 03:56.541
In you go! [laughs]

03:57.833 --> 04:01.208
-[Bonnie] Uncle B!
-[BTG] I know! [laughs]

-[screeching]

04:08.583 --> 04:11.708
[BTG] <i>We were tagging and tracking</i>
<i>the magnificent class B orca</i>

04:11.791 --> 04:13.833
<i>around the islands of the sub-Antarctic.</i>

04:14.416 --> 04:16.166
Bugger, I think we lost him.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.958
Why do we have to search
for killer whales?

04:18.041 --> 04:20.916
Can't we tag something nicer?
A friendship whale, perhaps?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.708
No! We're looking for a killer,

04:23.791 --> 04:26.750
just like in my favorite podcast,
<i>Murder Death Crime Hunt.</i>

04:26.833 --> 04:28.958
Killer whale is actually
a misleading name.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.666
Why? Are they nice,
peaceful ambassadors of the sea?

04:31.750 --> 04:34.041
[laughing] Oh no.
They're ruthless killers.

04:34.125 --> 04:37.875
Perhaps the most perfect example
of single-minded savagery

04:37.958 --> 04:40.625
manifested in weaponized flesh and bone.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.500
-A simple "no" would have sufficed.
-Hmm.

04:44.583 --> 04:46.458
But "killer whale" is misleading,

04:46.541 --> 04:49.250
because orcas are actually
the largest species of dolphin.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.875
Dolphins are so nice.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.541
Dolphins are literally baby murdering,
interspecies gang rapists,

04:54.625 --> 04:56.541
so, no, not that nice, actually.

04:56.625 --> 04:57.625
Yeah, Dietrich.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.000
Dolphins are evil,

04:59.083 --> 05:01.291
and we're not just talking
about any dolphin.

05:01.375 --> 05:05.125
We're talking about
a murder dolphin. [sighs]

05:05.208 --> 05:07.833
It's always been my dream
to track down a murderer.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.208
I hate my job.

05:09.291 --> 05:12.125
Why didn't I just start a food truck
like my dead Uncle Fritz?

05:12.208 --> 05:14.875
[gasps] Ooh! How did he die?
Was it a murder?

05:14.958 --> 05:17.041
He hung himself
with a string of frankfurters.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.125
[thunder rumbling]

05:19.916 --> 05:21.125
[gasps] Ugh.

05:21.208 --> 05:25.333
Yo, dogs. This is, like,
the worst whale hunt I've ever been on.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.500
[sucks, exhales]

05:27.583 --> 05:31.250
You could have at least, like,
hired a topless bartender or something.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.333
That's what my uncle did
for his whale hunt.

05:34.333 --> 05:35.958
I'd taken on an intern, Luke.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.458
He had tremendous potential,

05:37.541 --> 05:40.708
and the fact that his very wealthy parents
funded this expedition

05:40.791 --> 05:42.875
had nothing to do with why he was there.

05:42.958 --> 05:44.583
We're not hunting whales, Luke.

05:44.666 --> 05:47.291
We need to tag orcas
so we can track their migration and--

05:47.375 --> 05:52.083
[snores] Oh my God, Dr. Snooze here
is putting my nuts to sleep,

05:52.166 --> 05:56.333
which is impossible
because my nuts are always on <i>fuego</i>.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.750
Hey, man, don't pollute! [coughs]

06:00.833 --> 06:02.541
[scoffs] Is this guy for real?

06:02.625 --> 06:05.875
We're at the top of the food chain.
We can do whatever we want.

06:05.958 --> 06:07.583
-[rumbling]
-[clicking]

06:07.666 --> 06:09.666
Murder dolphin!

06:10.958 --> 06:12.791
Dietrich, grab the chum seal!

06:12.875 --> 06:15.000
Chum seal. Chum seal. Let's see.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.916
I put it under C for "chum." Or wait,
uh, maybe it was under S for "seal."

06:19.000 --> 06:20.291
It's right here!

06:20.375 --> 06:22.166
[grunts] Oh God, it stinks.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.041
Goodbye, chum seal.

06:24.583 --> 06:27.166
You weren't just chum, you were my chum.

06:28.833 --> 06:30.125
[all scream]

06:30.208 --> 06:33.083
Come on, man! This watch is cashmere!

06:33.666 --> 06:37.500
-Why won't he eat the chum seal?
-[BTG] Because he wants to eat us.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.208
We're just big fat seals to him.

06:39.291 --> 06:40.875
Murder dolphin!

06:40.958 --> 06:43.458
[BTG] When a class B orca
spots a resting seal,

06:43.541 --> 06:45.791
they'll swim together in a V formation

06:45.875 --> 06:49.125
to create a wave
that will wash the seal into the water.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.750
-Whoa! Whoa!
-[all yelling]

06:52.833 --> 06:55.750
That's it!
I'm gonna turn this whale into my new…

06:55.833 --> 06:57.166
uh, hat!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.958
-[all yelling]
-[air hissing]

06:59.041 --> 07:01.083
Kraken fat! Missed him by a mile!

07:01.166 --> 07:02.458
We're taking on water.

07:02.541 --> 07:04.625
Die, you stinking whale!

07:04.708 --> 07:05.875
[squawks]

07:08.458 --> 07:09.500
Damn it, Luke!

07:10.125 --> 07:11.875
Dietrich, take this flash drive.

07:11.958 --> 07:16.375
This holds all the orca data
from the entire expedition.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.625
Do not lose it.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.000
I can do this.
Holding a flash drive is easy.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.250
I've been holding this fish in my pocket.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.791
Oh no, my pocket fish died.

07:25.416 --> 07:27.416
I'm going in. Bonnie, take the wheel.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.708
Aye-aye, Uncle Captain.

07:28.791 --> 07:31.500
Wait! You can't go in the water.
They'll eat you.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.833
Class B orcas are seal eaters.
I'm dressed as a penguin.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.458
[grunts]

07:38.375 --> 07:39.625
[groans]

07:40.833 --> 07:41.916
Ah!

07:42.500 --> 07:45.416
I was in pursuit
of the ultimate apex predator.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.750
It was super dangerous,
but I wasn't worried.

07:47.833 --> 07:51.333
I'd dealt with heinous and cruel animals
many times before,

07:51.416 --> 07:54.708
like moody hippos,
who viciously tear apart any animal

07:54.791 --> 07:56.375
that comes near the local water supply.

07:56.458 --> 07:59.000
-[bellows]
-[screams] Pretty violent for a vegan!

07:59.083 --> 08:00.291
Or the golden eagle,

08:00.375 --> 08:03.291
who pull goats off cliffs
so they plummet to their deaths.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.666
-[eagle screeching]
-Oh!

08:04.750 --> 08:08.750
Not cool, eagle!

08:08.833 --> 08:11.041
Or those disgusting swine at the gym

08:11.125 --> 08:13.958
who sweat all over the equipment
without wiping it down,

08:14.041 --> 08:16.291
spreading their greasy, infected filth.

08:16.375 --> 08:18.791
Good set. All yours, big guy.

08:18.875 --> 08:19.958
Thanks, mate!

08:20.041 --> 08:22.333
You disgust me,
you weepy armpit son of a--

08:22.416 --> 08:25.791
Some might argue those animals are evil,
but they're not evil.

08:25.875 --> 08:27.250
They're just being animals,

08:27.333 --> 08:30.583
which is why, in the wild,
you have to be ready for any--

08:31.166 --> 08:33.333
[grunting]

08:33.416 --> 08:34.625
[gasps]

08:34.708 --> 08:35.916
Leopard seal!

08:36.625 --> 08:39.791
They'll toy with penguins just for fun
without eating them.

08:40.416 --> 08:41.791
I hate being bullied.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.208
This is like grade school all over again.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.250
-Thirsty, BTG? [laughs]
<i>-</i>No!

08:47.333 --> 08:48.458
-Have some water!
-[grunting]

08:48.541 --> 08:51.291
Careful!
You might get your beard wet, freak!

08:51.375 --> 08:54.125
I'm gonna cut that beard
right off your face. [laughs]

08:54.208 --> 08:55.458
-[hissing]
-[screams]

08:57.500 --> 08:59.333
Thanks, Dr. Slithers!

08:59.416 --> 09:03.166
And that's why I love snakes
and hate public toilets. [grunts]

09:06.458 --> 09:08.000
Yes, saved by the orca!

09:08.916 --> 09:11.708
Orcas are bullies too,
except they bully seals.

09:11.791 --> 09:12.791
-[beeping]
-[BTG laughing]

09:12.875 --> 09:15.125
The ocean is just chock-full of jerks.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.166
And after every murder,
he'd order a pizza.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.416
Some say he would top it with human meat.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.958
I think that's enough murder stories
for one day.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.500
He called it "people-roni."

09:27.583 --> 09:29.541
[laughs] He just made that up himself!

09:29.625 --> 09:31.750
God, I love murderers! They're so clever.

09:31.833 --> 09:35.208
I hope I never ate people-roni.
It'd be so hard to tell.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.000
[grunts]

09:37.083 --> 09:38.333
Murder Dolphin!

09:38.416 --> 09:41.041
Dietrich, you pasty fish stick. It's me!

09:41.125 --> 09:42.750
Oh! Oh yeah.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.916
-You good?
-Oh, hey, Uncle B.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.708
-Did you tag the orca?
-Aye.

09:46.791 --> 09:49.666
Looks like our job is done here.
Where's Luke?

09:49.750 --> 09:51.500
He pulled out a French dip sandwich

09:51.583 --> 09:53.583
and said he wanted to get away
from the beach

09:53.666 --> 09:56.000
because it smells like Dietrich's anus.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.083
[Dietrich] Hey!

09:57.708 --> 10:01.625
[sniffs] Mmm, that disgusting smell
is penguin puke and fecal matter.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.041
It's everywhere down here.

10:03.125 --> 10:05.833
But did you say French dip?
I love a French dip.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.500
Me too, French dips are great.

10:07.583 --> 10:10.916
No! Thieving vape-head!
That was my French dip.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.958
I hope he chokes
on that beautiful sandwich.

10:13.041 --> 10:13.875
Me too.

10:13.958 --> 10:17.583
Anyway, he's over there
lying facedown on the ice.

10:18.166 --> 10:19.875
Oh my God! Is he dead?

10:20.458 --> 10:21.625
[squawking]

10:21.708 --> 10:23.666
No, he's not dead.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.291
Maybe he's in a food coma.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.125
[BTG] Oh, that's not good.

10:27.208 --> 10:29.625
It's just an arm, he could still be--

10:29.708 --> 10:31.791
-[BTG] Oh!
-Oh, come on!

10:34.708 --> 10:36.083
-Ugh!
-[BTG] Mm. No respect.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.458
I read about a guy once

10:37.541 --> 10:40.500
who lost all his limbs
and became a mountain climber.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.875
-[winces]
-[gags]

10:43.958 --> 10:45.083
[groans]

10:50.833 --> 10:54.166
Eaten by a murder dolphin…
Pretty hard to come back from that.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.500
Eating the king of meat sandwiches
on an ice floe?

10:56.583 --> 10:59.458
That's incredibly stupid.
Countless hungry predators out there.

10:59.541 --> 11:01.666
You mean countless suspects.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.666
What?

11:02.750 --> 11:04.333
Something murdered Luke.

11:04.416 --> 11:07.416
[gasps] This is it.
This is the moment I've been waiting for!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.958
You've been waiting
for a colleague to get murdered?

11:10.041 --> 11:12.166
Yes! I always thought it'd be Dietrich.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.250
-Me too.
-Hey!

11:13.333 --> 11:14.541
But this works great, too.

11:14.625 --> 11:15.750
Someone murdered Luke,

11:15.833 --> 11:18.875
and I'm the only podcast-equipment-owning
amateur detective

11:18.958 --> 11:22.333
with enough ill-gotten confidence
to take the case.

11:22.416 --> 11:25.750
This is my <i>Murder Death Crime Hunt</i>.

11:26.375 --> 11:29.208
All these suspects
were spotted at the scene of the crime,

11:29.291 --> 11:30.708
but who killed Luke?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.500
The shifty skua bird?

11:32.583 --> 11:36.083
The down-on-his-luck Adélie penguin?
The hotheaded fur seal?

11:36.625 --> 11:38.791
Maybe it was you!

11:38.875 --> 11:41.666
Me? I was right next to you when he died.

11:41.750 --> 11:42.791
Maybe.

11:42.875 --> 11:45.333
You're highly forgettable,
so we can't be sure.

11:45.416 --> 11:48.125
Luke is dead
because he was sitting on an ice floe

11:48.208 --> 11:51.750
with delectable French dip meat juice
dripping into the open ocean.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.916
I would've been shocked
if he hadn't been eaten.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.166
That's the thing.
He was only eaten after he was murdered.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.500
I mean, what kind of animal
murders someone and doesn't eat them?

12:00.583 --> 12:03.000
Just about every kind of carnivore.

12:03.083 --> 12:04.750
It's called surplus killing.

12:04.833 --> 12:05.875
[bleating]

12:05.958 --> 12:08.958
Leopards in South Africa
will murder entire flocks of goats

12:09.041 --> 12:12.250
-and only drag away one carcass to eat.
-[leopard snarls]

12:12.333 --> 12:15.166
-[BTG bleating]
-[leopard growling]

12:16.875 --> 12:18.166
[BTG] Tried these wildflowers?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.666
Oh, well,
this won't haunt my dreams at all.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.791
[growls]

12:23.333 --> 12:25.791
Wolves, weasels, lions, hyenas,

12:25.875 --> 12:28.708
bears, raccoons have all been known
to kill for pure pleasure.

12:28.791 --> 12:32.000
So, you're saying we have
an animal serial killer on our hands?

12:32.083 --> 12:34.541
I'm not saying that
because it's not a thing.

12:34.625 --> 12:37.666
Come on, we need to repair the boats,
stow the gear, and head home.

12:39.833 --> 12:40.833
Oh, my…

12:40.916 --> 12:44.041
-Dietrich, what did you do?
-I was standing right next to you.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.291
Was he really?

12:45.375 --> 12:46.375
Why me?

12:46.875 --> 12:48.250
I can't be a serial killer.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.958
I'm just a scrawny white guy
with glasses, poor posture,

12:51.041 --> 12:52.875
and an oddly proportioned face!

12:53.500 --> 12:56.500
Oh no!
I look exactly like a serial killer!

12:57.708 --> 13:00.458
-[BTG] Something got into the chum.
-[Dietrich] No, no!

13:00.541 --> 13:02.416
Someone ate chum seal!

13:02.500 --> 13:04.250
Oh, the humanity!

13:04.333 --> 13:07.166
You mean our chum seal was murdered?
The killer struck again!

13:07.250 --> 13:10.375
-Please tell me the flash drive is safe.
-I don't see it.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.666
All that's under F is a foosball,
and we don't even have a table.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.375
You had one job, Dietrich! One job!

13:16.458 --> 13:19.000
That was weeks' worth
of orca research data.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.958
We're gonna have to start all over.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.500
Would that be so bad?

13:22.583 --> 13:24.750
Now that Luke's dead,
it'll be a lot more fun.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.375
I like it when it's the three of us.

13:26.458 --> 13:29.791
Whoever killed our chum seal
also stole our data.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.416
A klepto-murderer,

13:31.500 --> 13:33.750
just like Filthy Fingers Pete
from Tuscaloosa.

13:33.833 --> 13:37.458
Fun fact, he cut off his mom's hands
because he was sick of playing patty-cake.

13:37.541 --> 13:40.416
-[squawking]
-Do you hear that?

13:41.416 --> 13:42.666
Shearwaters.

13:42.750 --> 13:46.541
The shearwaters' sharp, pointed beak
is great for hunting fish. Ow!

13:46.625 --> 13:49.416
They travel in flocks
numbering in the hundreds.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.333
That's why they were the inspiration

13:51.416 --> 13:53.791
for Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie,
<i>The Birds.</i>

13:53.875 --> 13:56.250
[sobbing] This couldn't get any worse!

13:56.333 --> 13:58.333
[squawking]

13:59.250 --> 14:00.666
Skuas!

14:00.750 --> 14:04.833
Skuas could catch their own fish
but they prefer to attack shearwaters

14:04.916 --> 14:06.750
and steal their food instead,

14:06.833 --> 14:10.791
like a mugging at knifepoint,
but their knife is their face.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.083
It's raining sweet, sweet death.

14:14.416 --> 14:16.583
It's the murder case of the century!

14:16.666 --> 14:18.625
[bird call]

14:18.708 --> 14:19.708
Come here, birds.

14:19.791 --> 14:20.875
Get your chum fix.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.083
[birds squawking]

14:25.166 --> 14:26.250
[wails]

14:27.875 --> 14:30.166
Decapitated and left for dead.

14:30.875 --> 14:33.083
[sobbing] You deserved better, chum seal.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.541
But don't worry, no one can hurt you now.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.041
-Oh God, no!
-Look, a clue!

14:39.833 --> 14:42.083
The killer is getting sloppy.

14:42.166 --> 14:43.250
Nice work, Bonnie!

14:43.333 --> 14:45.541
If we follow that streak,
it may lead us to--

14:45.625 --> 14:46.833
Luke's murderer!

14:46.916 --> 14:50.833
I was gonna say a warm pile of fresh feces
with a flash drive in it, but sure.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.916
[upbeat music playing]

14:53.583 --> 14:54.833
[penguins peeping]

14:56.333 --> 14:58.333
[music continues]

15:00.125 --> 15:02.125
[Bonnie] Ha! There's our killer.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.916
Caught red-flippered.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.291
Okay, we should get into camo and--

15:07.208 --> 15:08.208
Hello?

15:09.625 --> 15:11.291
Take it easy, fish whiskers.

15:11.958 --> 15:14.875
I'm just gonna check that tasty chum
for our flash drive.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.625
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [mutters, grunts]

15:18.708 --> 15:21.125

15:30.750 --> 15:32.250
Uncle B, are you okay?

15:32.333 --> 15:35.375
Our fur seal is in that grotto. [groans]

15:35.458 --> 15:37.458
[shrieking, honking]

15:40.625 --> 15:43.166
It sounds like
he's torturing victims in his lair.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.500
Ooh, maybe he's cutting off their skin
and wearing it like a mask.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.875
No, it sounds more like…

15:48.958 --> 15:50.625
[shrieking, honking continues]

15:52.333 --> 15:55.041
Yeah, it's Adélie penguins
lining up to have sex

15:55.125 --> 15:57.250
with a half-frozen female's corpse.

15:57.333 --> 15:59.958
Those overeager males think
she's presenting for coitus,

16:00.041 --> 16:01.958
but she just died
with her butt in the air.

16:02.041 --> 16:05.833
Necrophilia?
Where's the line, you filthy animals?

16:05.916 --> 16:07.166
Nature has no lines.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.958
Animals are amoral.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.500
-[yells]
-[Dietrich and Bonnie gasp]

16:11.000 --> 16:13.500
Why won't you poop out my data?

16:13.583 --> 16:15.125
[huffs, snarls]

16:17.541 --> 16:18.791
Your breath is just--

16:18.875 --> 16:19.708
Wow.

16:19.791 --> 16:21.208
Time to play dead.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.375
You are unbelievable.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.375
I knew it was you!

16:26.458 --> 16:28.708
I'm glad
I got to look the killer in the eye

16:28.791 --> 16:30.083
before it was all over!

16:30.166 --> 16:32.166
Go ahead, feed me to the pigs.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.125
[in distorted voice]
Bury my head in the garden

16:34.208 --> 16:35.541
and send the flowers to my family!

16:35.625 --> 16:38.416
[in normal voice] Dump my body
in a bathtub filled with acid.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.416
-Whew! Holy crap.
-Bonnie, you all right?

16:47.500 --> 16:49.541
I really thought
I was gonna be murdered there.

-Dietrich?

[penguin honking]

16:53.041 --> 16:55.041
Why does this keep happening?

16:55.125 --> 16:57.000
Oh, the shame.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.291
[penguin honking]

16:59.916 --> 17:03.250
[groans] This won't haunt
my dreams either. Oh!

17:03.333 --> 17:04.958
Stop humping my fanny pack.

17:05.541 --> 17:07.666
Wait a second, F is for "fanny pack."

17:07.750 --> 17:08.833
[unzipping]

17:11.416 --> 17:13.375
I put all my F things in the fanny pack.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.875
Look, a French dip sandwich!

17:15.958 --> 17:17.833
Mmm… French dip,

17:18.333 --> 17:20.750
the king of meat sandwiches.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.375
[penguin honking]

17:22.958 --> 17:26.541
So, it was the fur seal the whole time.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.041
But why did the orca help us?
I thought he was evil.

17:29.125 --> 17:32.875
He wasn't trying to help us,
and orcas aren't good or evil.

17:32.958 --> 17:36.916
Evil is a human concept.
We invented it and we perfected it.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.875
No matter how evil an animal acts,

17:39.958 --> 17:43.083
they are simply being true
to their nature. Ow!

17:43.166 --> 17:44.166
Touché.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.125
Almost packed. Down to S.

17:46.208 --> 17:48.750
Shirts, safety pins,
security cameras, sex toys--

17:48.833 --> 17:50.583
Wait, did you say security cameras?

17:50.666 --> 17:53.333
Yeah, I always have my security cameras
set up and filming.

17:53.416 --> 17:55.833
It makes it easier
to file my health insurance claims.

17:55.916 --> 17:57.333

18:08.625 --> 18:12.083
[Bonnie] Wow, he actually choked
on his beautiful sandwich.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.375
[squawking]

18:14.291 --> 18:16.500
<i>Okay, now I feel really bad.</i>

18:19.041 --> 18:22.166
The polar bear basically
gets energy and warmth through its skin

18:22.250 --> 18:23.750
via the translucent hair fiber.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.708
She looks beautiful.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.083
-[Bonnie] Doesn't she?
-Yeah, why are you doing this?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.875
She was so filthy.

18:29.958 --> 18:32.166
Well, that is kind of how they live.

18:32.250 --> 18:35.083
Porcupines are, by their very nature,
covered in dirt and piss.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.625
Have you ever had
a porcupine quill in your skin?

18:37.708 --> 18:40.541
Once it gets into your tender flesh,
the moisture of your blood

18:40.625 --> 18:41.791
causes it to swell,

18:41.875 --> 18:44.000
like 800 tiny fish hooks.

18:44.083 --> 18:47.583
And because they're always covered
in dirt and piss,

18:47.666 --> 18:49.500
you often get a secondary infection.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.625
-Have you been hit by a porcupine quill?
-Oh my God, yes.

18:52.708 --> 18:54.750
You can't love a porcupine
and not be quilled.

18:54.833 --> 18:55.916
[Bonnie] Beauty is pain.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.458
The visual of exterior pain

18:57.541 --> 18:59.916
allows this porcupine
to have a beautiful soul.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.166
She's not at all evil,
even if she looks it.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.250
But she is covered in dirt and piss.
That's true. That's a fact.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.333
[groovy music playing]
