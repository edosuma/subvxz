00:27.287 --> 00:28.411
Missed one.

00:38.250 --> 00:39.448
Nice work, Rico.

00:39.788 --> 00:40.662
Morning.

00:43.082 --> 00:45.125
Watch out for the ninjas, Marlene.

00:45.394 --> 00:47.460
You mean bowling pins?

00:47.775 --> 00:49.163
I mean ninjas.

00:49.797 --> 00:51.964
Don't you see the little faces on them?

00:52.238 --> 00:55.259
Why are you guys working,
anyway? Come on, it's fun day!

00:55.547 --> 00:56.427
Fun day?

00:56.595 --> 00:58.888
Rico, code blue. Private, weapons check.

00:59.056 --> 01:00.260
Kowalski, options...

01:00.630 --> 01:03.434
Hold on, wait, what is this fun day?

01:03.709 --> 01:05.193
Few humans visit on mondays.

01:05.318 --> 01:08.896
Thus our zoo overlords
renamed monday "fun day. "

01:09.171 --> 01:11.420
Why wasn't this in my morning briefing?

01:11.545 --> 01:13.052
How am I supposed to know that?

01:13.177 --> 01:16.196
Come on, people, I'm not a mind reader.

01:16.364 --> 01:19.824
You, Skipper, are just
not fun day material.

01:21.046 --> 01:23.035
- Hit the brakes, sister.
- What?

01:23.203 --> 01:25.636
I've taken down an angry
walrus with a wing and a prayer

01:25.761 --> 01:27.998
and another wing. I can handle anything.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.022
Except fun.

01:30.147 --> 01:31.757
Especially fun.

01:31.985 --> 01:33.086
Right, boys?

01:33.726 --> 01:36.465
- Big fun.
- Yes, Skipper, sure.

01:37.075 --> 01:39.205
I'm as fun as the next guy.

01:39.435 --> 01:41.803
Not if the next guy is that guy.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.975
It makes my tummy tingle.

01:49.126 --> 01:52.021
Hello, silly penguin. What
are you doing in my bouncy?

01:52.189 --> 01:53.647
Because it's fun day.

01:54.177 --> 01:56.536
And certain sea mammals
think I'm no fun.

01:58.904 --> 02:02.072
Check out this fun move.
I call it "Corkscrew".

02:41.922 --> 02:43.695
You, you did this.

02:44.459 --> 02:47.281
- What?
- You did this.

02:47.704 --> 02:49.869
I know, I take full responsibility.

02:49.994 --> 02:51.160
Well, 90%.

02:52.196 --> 02:55.080
I said "Have fun". I
did not say "Go nuts".

02:55.613 --> 02:56.415
Right.

02:56.540 --> 02:59.543
I should not have
"Corkscrewed". Shame on me.

03:02.623 --> 03:05.548
Maurice, it was all in
fun. Come on, bring in it.

03:06.137 --> 03:07.258
I'm not laughing!

03:08.940 --> 03:11.046
All right, I'll try to
calm down the screamer

03:11.171 --> 03:13.639
while you guys go get his
crown. Sound like a plan?

03:14.058 --> 03:15.891
It does sound like a plan.

03:16.059 --> 03:17.476
Commence operation:

03:17.769 --> 03:19.898
"Give the furry crybaby his bottle".

03:22.302 --> 03:23.899
She did stop the screaming.

03:26.095 --> 03:27.642
I will get you for...

03:30.310 --> 03:33.548
How am I supposed to be
kingly without a crown?

03:33.673 --> 03:35.452
It is the proof of my kingliness.

03:35.725 --> 03:37.063
And that is why

03:37.438 --> 03:39.288
I'm going to make you...

03:39.610 --> 03:40.495
Ready?

03:40.938 --> 03:42.500
Wait for it.

03:42.924 --> 03:44.568
A new crown!

03:45.496 --> 03:48.005
But the old crown and I have
been through so much together.

03:49.374 --> 03:52.319
But it wasn't as amazingly cool as...

03:55.390 --> 03:56.304
This!

04:00.199 --> 04:02.435
It is puffy and complicated.

04:02.603 --> 04:03.838
Like me.

04:14.072 --> 04:15.151
I got you...

04:15.436 --> 04:16.392
or not.

04:25.650 --> 04:27.469
I want my old crown.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.209
Skipper, turns out the
new crown didn't fly.

04:30.334 --> 04:32.209
It did fly, too much.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.757
Not to worry, Marlene.
We're on the trail.

04:43.862 --> 04:45.309
Private, hold the flashlight.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.141
Oh, dear.

04:49.787 --> 04:51.648
I don't like the looks of this.

04:51.816 --> 04:53.942
Keen instinct tells me
there's danger ahead.

04:54.507 --> 04:56.848
And it's got my name
written all over it.

04:57.139 --> 04:58.530
You three wait here.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.241
I think I'd prefer to tag along
if it's all the same, Skipper.

05:02.538 --> 05:05.094
Denied, Private. I
"corkscrewed" us into this.

05:05.582 --> 05:06.833
I'll go solo.

05:09.279 --> 05:11.417
But you're forgetting the penguin credo:

05:11.585 --> 05:13.294
"Never swim alone. "

05:13.419 --> 05:15.462
Skipper, we're in this together.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.214
And by "this," I mean a steel cage trap.

05:27.039 --> 05:29.061
My head is naked.

05:29.186 --> 05:30.743
My head is nude.

05:31.251 --> 05:32.979
My head is crownless.

05:33.147 --> 05:35.398
Dark... is my mood.

05:35.761 --> 05:38.484
Crazy poetry... good stuff.

05:38.725 --> 05:40.186
I want my crown.

05:40.521 --> 05:42.946
And I have your crown,

05:43.114 --> 05:46.024
a crown you'll love as
much as you love yourself,

05:46.263 --> 05:47.400
because...

05:48.536 --> 05:49.759
It's you!

05:50.310 --> 05:53.935
There is an awesome amount
of fabulousness going on here.

05:56.220 --> 06:00.582
- It is hot with handsomeness.
- And here's the best part.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.996
My need for beauty and
my need for fizzy drink,

06:07.319 --> 06:08.657
both are satisfied.

06:16.469 --> 06:17.652
My little head!

06:18.934 --> 06:22.025
I like you hideously disfigured.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.282
Oh, boy. Sewer rats.

06:29.559 --> 06:31.492
They're actually quite cute.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.855
Attenti-oh-nay,
little rodentia.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.798
Has anyone seen a leafy crown?

06:40.533 --> 06:41.543
Maybe.

06:41.711 --> 06:43.837
- What's it to you?
- We need it, pronto.

06:44.113 --> 06:46.216
It belongs to our King.

06:46.745 --> 06:50.218
- And there's only one way to have it.
- Smile and say "please"?

06:52.225 --> 06:54.207
Paw-to-paw
combat.

06:54.332 --> 06:56.205
Beat the King, get the crown.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.137
Beat the King, get the crown.

07:03.938 --> 07:06.442
I'll go easy on him.
Where is the little guy?

07:11.599 --> 07:13.630
- You are toast.
- What was that?

07:13.755 --> 07:15.072
Crusty on the outside,

07:15.197 --> 07:17.680
soft and warm on the
inside, and good in a jam.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.787
That's nice.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.498
You're going down,
clown, down to rat town.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.652
Aren't we already there?

07:27.202 --> 07:31.006
Now, this might be working for me.

07:32.693 --> 07:33.591
Smart.

07:34.233 --> 07:36.519
Do you really think you can pull it off?

07:36.968 --> 07:38.722
- Snake!
- I don't... Come on...

07:38.890 --> 07:41.600
- Snake!
- That was a good look.

07:41.923 --> 07:44.622
<i>- Tell me you found the crown.
- The crown's been found.</i>

07:44.974 --> 07:47.439
That's great. Wait, where's Skipper?

07:47.858 --> 07:50.029
<i>He's unable to take your call right now.</i>

07:50.154 --> 07:52.781
<i>He's about to battle a
mutated rodent warlord.</i>

07:55.483 --> 07:56.655
Kowalski, analysis.

07:56.823 --> 07:58.917
This appears to be a former lab rat,

07:59.409 --> 08:01.102
thus the extreme mutations.

08:04.581 --> 08:06.331
Incredible size and brute strength...

08:07.917 --> 08:11.013
And magnificent aim
aren't... everything.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.679
You and me,
bird, one-on-one.

08:22.848 --> 08:24.849
Talkin' about no help from the flock.

08:25.159 --> 08:26.350
Agreed.

08:28.929 --> 08:29.968
Let's dance.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.188
I'll lead.

08:40.284 --> 08:43.032
That the best you got? Bird,
that is some weak sauce.

08:45.415 --> 08:46.703
Missed me that time.

08:49.790 --> 08:50.940
Feel the rat.

08:55.837 --> 08:56.962
Who's your rat daddy?

09:06.848 --> 09:09.574
How do you like me now, flightless bird?

09:15.674 --> 09:18.482
I knew you'd go running
home to your... mama!

09:20.214 --> 09:23.237
- Poor Skipper. I can't look.
- This is the worst fun day ever.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.864
Fun day. Of course.

09:28.949 --> 09:30.035
The "Corkscrew".

09:36.537 --> 09:38.379
Who's got the weak sauce, now?

09:47.293 --> 09:50.095
Look, look, you could
be King of the cowboys.

09:52.351 --> 09:53.307
Shut up, okay?

09:53.669 --> 09:55.233
Can you not see that your King,

09:55.358 --> 09:58.645
which was me until the
incident, is brooding?

09:59.567 --> 10:00.897
I failed. I failed.

10:01.282 --> 10:03.766
Everybody, I failed. There.

10:03.891 --> 10:05.979
I am an otter failure.

10:06.218 --> 10:08.982
If I could just say a magic
word and make your crown appear,

10:09.107 --> 10:10.031
I would.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.366
The magic word is...

10:12.757 --> 10:13.659
fun day.

10:14.491 --> 10:15.520
My crown!

10:18.550 --> 10:21.529
I have missed you, little head thing.

10:23.006 --> 10:24.711
It has a smudgy spot on it.

10:25.112 --> 10:27.005
Well, you see, there were these sewer...

10:27.173 --> 10:29.057
No, this simply will not do.

10:30.270 --> 10:32.111
Bring me my spare crown.

10:34.908 --> 10:35.805
Much better.

10:36.726 --> 10:38.074
A spare crown?

10:38.705 --> 10:41.417
He just had, you know,
just sitting around...

10:41.824 --> 10:44.897
All along a spare crown all along?

10:45.970 --> 10:47.076
For emergencies.

10:47.201 --> 10:49.318
What kind of fool King
would only have one crown?

10:52.714 --> 10:55.908
What? No, never on a fun day,

10:56.147 --> 10:57.128
seriously.
