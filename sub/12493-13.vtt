WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.959
Okay, it's all set.

00:05.041 --> 00:07.250
Charlie, Teddy and I are going
to Chicago this weekend

00:07.375 --> 00:08.917
to visit great aunt Nell.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.125
What's so great about aunt Nell?

00:10.208 --> 00:12.625
Calling a relative great
just means they're really old.

00:14.125 --> 00:15.333
Right, great Dad?

00:17.375 --> 00:19.083
Well, I guess I deserve that

00:19.166 --> 00:21.917
for quietly sitting here
eating my oatmeal.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.333
You guys, don't be ridiculous.

00:24.417 --> 00:26.625
She's not great because she's old,

00:26.709 --> 00:28.125
she's great because she's rich.

00:30.041 --> 00:32.333
And if we kiss up to her,
she'll put us in the will.

00:33.333 --> 00:36.041
Mom, I don't understand
why I have to go and the guys don't.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.834
Because, honey, there's a lot
of cash on the line

00:37.917 --> 00:39.083
so I'm going with the "A" team.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.250
Ha ha, you made the "A" team!

00:43.500 --> 00:46.291
And while we're gone,
I want you guys to clean out the attic.

00:46.792 --> 00:50.000
Oh, take that, "B" team! "A" team rules.

00:50.083 --> 00:50.959
Hey!

00:52.458 --> 00:55.417
Yeah well, you only get to go to Chicago!

00:55.500 --> 00:57.709
We get to go to the attic.

00:57.792 --> 01:00.000
- That's not better.
- I know, "B" team stinks.

01:00.917 --> 01:02.083
Listen up, "B" teamers,

01:02.166 --> 01:04.458
I've got something very important to do
while the girls are gone,

01:04.542 --> 01:07.417
so you two are gonna clean out
the attic by yourselves.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.917
What are we supposed
to do with all that junk?

01:10.750 --> 01:12.583
We could have a yard sale,
make some money off it.

01:12.667 --> 01:14.417
No, that's stupid.

01:16.375 --> 01:17.709
Wait a minute.

01:18.041 --> 01:19.417
That's a really good idea.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.875
PJ, I think that's the first
good idea you've ever had!

01:22.333 --> 01:24.709
- What? No, it's not. He had the...
- Yeah.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.834
Didn't you do the--

01:29.125 --> 01:31.166
Wow, congratulations. Well done.

Yeah, you missed Charlie's

02:35.959 --> 02:38.333
two-hour rendition
of "Twinkle, twinkle, little star."

02:38.417 --> 02:41.667
- Ohhh, sing it again, Charlie.
- All: No!

02:43.750 --> 02:44.583
Oh.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.375
Look.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.625
Teddy: Aunt Nell sent a car for us.
Isn't that sweet?

02:48.959 --> 02:50.333
That's not sweet!

02:50.375 --> 02:52.834
That old bat's wasting money
that could be ours someday.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.542
You hear that, Charlie?

02:56.625 --> 02:58.083
Can you feel the love?

03:03.500 --> 03:05.458
Hey, Dad--

03:05.542 --> 03:07.709
No no! Not now.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.500
- What are you watching?
- Don't-- Aw, man.

03:12.583 --> 03:15.000
Only the greatest show

03:15.083 --> 03:17.542
in the history of television,
Higgins & Zork .

03:20.625 --> 03:23.458
Frank Higgins, hardboiled human detective

03:23.542 --> 03:26.917
and his trigger-happy alien partner Zork!

03:28.875 --> 03:31.041
Together the two of them go through space

03:31.125 --> 03:33.500
and they fight intergalactic crime.

03:34.583 --> 03:37.834
This is the important thing
you had to do while mom was gone?

03:37.917 --> 03:39.250
Yes.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.834
Look, when your mom
and I first got married,

03:42.917 --> 03:45.250
she thought I spent a little
too much time watching the show

03:46.083 --> 03:50.250
and going to conventions
and buying really cool costumes!

03:50.333 --> 03:51.750
But it's not like I have a problem.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.750
Whoa! Can't have these two together.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.959
That is bad blood.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.667
Yeah, you got it under control.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.458
Look, I've only got 72 hours

04:03.542 --> 04:06.250
to watch all 64 episodes,
so what do you guys want?

04:06.333 --> 04:08.083
And tell me in 30 seconds or less.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.166
Uh, okay, um, the thing that we want is...

04:11.208 --> 04:12.583
- Twenty-four seconds.
- Take it, Gabe.

04:14.709 --> 04:16.709
We want to put prices
on all the yard-sale stuff.

04:16.917 --> 04:18.875
- Do we have a pricing gun?
- No.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.750
But if you want to see a really cool gun,

04:22.834 --> 04:24.792
check out Zork's.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.417
Man on TV: No, Zork, stop.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.792
Keep your cool, man.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.500
Neptune is a by-the-book planet.

04:33.667 --> 04:34.917
This is so good.

04:42.792 --> 04:44.667
Whoa, what is this place?

04:45.709 --> 04:47.917
Why would the driver take us to a...

04:48.000 --> 04:51.458
- A TV studio?
- I have no idea.

04:51.542 --> 04:54.250
But if aunt Nell's on a spending spree,
we've gotta nip this in the bud.

04:55.375 --> 04:56.917
Welcome to Shake it up, Chicago.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.041
I'm Gary Wilde and you must be
the fabulous Duncan sisters.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.250
- Oh.
- The what now?

05:01.834 --> 05:04.333
The Duncan sisters.
You're performing on the show tonight.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.041
That's funny. You think that we're--

05:08.125 --> 05:09.875
Fabulous. He just said so.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.041
My sister and I are so excited
about performing on your show.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.542
What are you doing?

05:15.625 --> 05:18.750
I'm thanking this wonderful man
for putting us on TV.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.458
- And who's this little creature?
- Amy: Oh, this is Charlie.

05:23.542 --> 05:25.458
She's, um...

05:26.875 --> 05:28.667
The youngest Duncan sister.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.667
Hi, Gary Wilde. How you doing?

05:33.709 --> 05:35.333
A little on the rude side, but okay.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.208
Anyway I can't wait to see
you guys do your thing tonight.

05:38.709 --> 05:40.125
About that, Gar, um,

05:40.208 --> 05:44.625
what is it you can't wait
to see us do exactly?

05:44.875 --> 05:47.041
My staff tells me your dancing is amazing.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.542
- Dancing?
- We're dancers.

05:49.625 --> 05:51.500
We knew that.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.417
Okay.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
Is there someplace I could
have a word in private

05:56.583 --> 05:58.041
with my, um,

05:58.834 --> 06:00.041
sister?

06:02.291 --> 06:05.291
Show the Duncans to their dressing rooms
and take good care of them.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.875
They are the stars of our show.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.417
Did you hear that? I'm a star.

06:25.041 --> 06:26.542
Oh, hi, Mrs. Dabney.

06:26.625 --> 06:27.792
I'm here for the yard sale.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.250
Uh, it's not till tomorrow.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.083
I know. I like to get a first shot
at the good stuff.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.417
Not that I expect you people
to have good stuff.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.500
Well, what are you looking for?

06:40.583 --> 06:42.041
Anything cat-related.

06:42.125 --> 06:44.667
Cat books, cat clocks, cat pictures,

06:44.750 --> 06:47.083
- cat clothes--
- Yeah yeah, we got it.

06:48.875 --> 06:52.625
Oh! Lucky for you we have
this genuine wooden cat bowl.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.750
What makes that a cat bowl?

06:56.125 --> 06:58.500
A cat could drink out of it.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.333
Or do his business in it.

07:02.875 --> 07:05.083
I knew I was wasting my time.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.041
Wait wait wait,

07:07.125 --> 07:08.792
I, I think we might have something.

07:09.333 --> 07:10.500
Be right back.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.333
So how you been?

07:16.750 --> 07:18.041
Do you really care?

07:20.041 --> 07:21.750
Just trying to get through
an awkward moment.

07:23.834 --> 07:27.208
Here we are. A kitty cat cookie jar.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.625
I might be able to take it off your hands.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.750
- How much you want for it?
- Make us an offer.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.709
- You first.
- You first.

07:34.792 --> 07:38.750
Okay, on the count of three,
just say your amounts at the same time.

07:38.834 --> 07:41.458
- One, two, three.
- Fifty dollars.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.458
Ten cents.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.041
Okay, all right.

07:46.125 --> 07:49.667
Try again. This time, guys,
try to be a little more realistic. Okay.

07:50.250 --> 07:51.667
One, two, three.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.208
- Forty-nine dollars.
- Eleven cents.

07:55.166 --> 07:56.667
This could take awhile.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.625
Well, it's not as big as we're used to,

08:05.709 --> 08:07.250
but it'll do.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.333
- Sisters?
- The Duncan sisters.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.250
Have you lost your mind?

08:15.333 --> 08:18.500
Teddy, this is my chance to be on TV.

08:18.583 --> 08:21.041
Mom, this is nuts. We can't do this.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.875
We have to! You know how
I've always wanted to be on TV.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.875
Remember when I tried out
for that cable show,

08:25.959 --> 08:27.000
"so you think you can yodel"?

08:27.083 --> 08:28.917
Mm-hmm. And they decided you couldn't.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.542
Look, the point is
I really want to do this.

08:32.917 --> 08:34.125
It's my dream.

08:35.208 --> 08:37.542
I mean, there's just one problem.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.250
We don't know any dance routines.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.792
So? We'll find someone to help us.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.083
Yeah? Like who?

08:43.166 --> 08:44.458
Come in.

08:44.542 --> 08:46.375
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.250
I'm Rocky and this is Cece

08:50.333 --> 08:52.333
and we like to come by
and welcome our guest stars.

08:52.417 --> 08:55.375
Yeah, and make sure
your gift baskets have arrived safely.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.667
Oooh, brownies.

08:58.291 --> 09:02.166
So you guys are the Duncan s-sisters?

09:03.375 --> 09:04.792
That's right, we are.

09:05.458 --> 09:08.166
And before you ask, no, we're not twins.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.417
She wasn't gonna ask that.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.333
And this is Charlie, our baby sister.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.083
Aw, Cece, look how cute she is.

09:18.166 --> 09:21.583
Our mother believes you're never
too young to absorb the magic.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.709
Oh, mom's kind of a nut log.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.583
You've always been jealous of our mom.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.667
Right, we should get going.
We're dancers on the show

09:31.750 --> 09:33.500
so if there's anything you need,
just let us know.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.166
You're dancers? Actually--

09:35.250 --> 09:38.250
uh, there is something
you could do for us.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.208
Really? Wow.

09:41.291 --> 09:44.000
No one's actually ever taken us up
on our offer before.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.875
Yeah, haven't you guys ever
heard of an empty gesture?

09:55.000 --> 09:56.250
Hang on one second.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.250
Dad, your pizza's here!

10:00.834 --> 10:03.250
H-h-h-hang on. I've gotta get some money.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.542
- Where's the kitty cat cookie jar?
- We sold it to Mrs. Dabney.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.542
- What?!
- Yeah, took an hour and a half,

10:12.625 --> 10:13.750
we made 10 bucks.

10:14.792 --> 10:17.750
Guys, that cookie jar is where
we keep our rainy-day money.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.792
There's 500 dollars in that!

10:21.834 --> 10:24.083
Wow, she got a really good deal.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.959
- Go get it back!
- How are we supposed to do that?

10:29.041 --> 10:30.792
You know what? Not my problem.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.000
Right now I'm in the middle
of a two-parter

10:33.083 --> 10:36.041
where Higgins and Zork go back
in time to save Pocahontas.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.792
Thank you.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.709
Dude, how are we gonna
get the cookie jar back?

10:42.875 --> 10:45.208
I was sorta hoping
you'd have another good idea.

10:46.083 --> 10:47.291
Okay.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.750
Okay, I got it. All right.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.792
So first we find a talking cat--

10:52.875 --> 10:54.417
And the well's run dry.

10:59.834 --> 11:03.583
So I was thinking you girls
could give us some input

11:03.667 --> 11:05.667
- on our dance routine.
- Okay, sure.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.333
- Just show us some of your moves.
- Yeah, sis,

11:08.375 --> 11:10.208
let's see what you've got.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.417
Well, I would love to,

11:12.583 --> 11:14.667
but with Charlie acting up like this,

11:14.750 --> 11:16.792
yeah, just...

11:17.250 --> 11:19.625
Maybe you should show us
some of your dance moves,

11:19.709 --> 11:22.000
that way we can fit
into your show's style.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.417
I don't want to come
in here and shake it up.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.709
Ha ha. Good thing you're better
dancers than comedians.

11:29.542 --> 11:30.750
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

11:32.542 --> 11:35.834
Well, most of the numbers we do
on Shake it up, Chicago are hip hop.

11:35.917 --> 11:37.458
- You know, stuff like this. Ready?
- Ready.

11:40.709 --> 11:41.750
Eh!

11:43.291 --> 11:44.917
- Hey.
- What?

11:48.834 --> 11:50.583
Of course we know that stuff.

11:52.542 --> 11:53.834
But could you show us one more time?

11:55.834 --> 11:57.625
Where are they? Where are they?

11:57.709 --> 11:59.375
Hey hey, guys. What are you doing here?

11:59.458 --> 12:02.417
Sorry, but he wanted to come by
and meet the Duncan sisters.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.375
Yeah, I want their autographs.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.333
Okay, so ask them. They're right here.

12:07.417 --> 12:09.709
Where? Behind these guys?

12:11.083 --> 12:12.500
Um, these are the Duncan sisters.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.125
I don't think so.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.375
But for the record, you are delicious.

12:17.959 --> 12:22.125
Oh, this trip just gets better and better.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.542
Uh, Flynn, what are you talking about?

12:24.625 --> 12:26.583
- Of course these are the Duncans.
- Look,

12:26.667 --> 12:28.750
I've got people willing to pay big money

12:28.834 --> 12:30.750
for signed pictures of the Duncan sisters.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.709
And they ain't them.

12:32.959 --> 12:34.583
These are.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.750
- I can explain that.
- Oh, come on!

12:41.834 --> 12:43.166
When are you gonna just--

12:44.417 --> 12:46.917
Actually I'd kinda like
to hear this myself.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.792
...and when we saw how different
we looked in the pictures,

12:59.417 --> 13:01.709
we said, "Mr. Photographer, you are fired

13:01.792 --> 13:03.583
because you did not do a good job at all!"

13:06.750 --> 13:08.834
Okay, that's enough dancing.
Everybody, take five.

13:12.083 --> 13:15.667
Okay, um, let me explain
something about my sister.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.667
First, she's my mother.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.000
Second, she's always had
this dream of being on TV

13:22.083 --> 13:24.625
and it makes her do some
crazy things sometimes.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.208
I'm so sorry.
We'll just grab our stuff and go.

13:28.250 --> 13:29.792
- I'd better go with you.
- Why?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.458
For protection.

13:32.583 --> 13:36.333
A babe like you shouldn't be walking
around without some muscle.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.500
Forget it, little dude. You got no shot.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.750
Yeah, like that's gonna stop him.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.834
Cece, her mom has the same dream we had.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.792
I mean maybe we should help her.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.792
- What's in it for us?
- Well, nothing.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.375
It's just a nice thing to do.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.625
Oh! And then after

14:04.709 --> 14:07.083
they give us money!

14:08.500 --> 14:11.083
No, Cece, we just do it
out of the kindness of our hearts.

14:11.166 --> 14:12.792
Okay, now I'm just lost.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.333
Look, we don't even
know if they can dance.

14:16.417 --> 14:17.500
How bad could they be?

14:30.083 --> 14:31.125
Come here.

14:32.709 --> 14:35.542
- Amy: A five, six, seven, eight.
- Wait a minute.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.500
The Duncans may not be great dancers,

14:38.583 --> 14:40.375
but they do have one thing going for them.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.959
That people will feel sorry for them.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.333
Okay, two things.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.875
- Whoo!
- And big finish, girls.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.500
So where's this valuable piece of art

14:56.583 --> 14:58.583
you want to trade me for the cookie jar?

14:58.667 --> 15:01.834
Here we are. Feast your eyes on this.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.542
- It's an original.
- No kidding.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.458
It was obviously drawn by a two-year-old.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.166
Hey, I'm 17!

15:15.417 --> 15:18.458
I can't believe you made me come
all the way over here for this!

15:18.542 --> 15:19.917
- Wait.
- Wait, look,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.959
we just want our cookie jar back.

15:22.041 --> 15:24.500
It has deep sentimental value to us.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.417
Too bad.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.041
Now it has deep sentimental value to me.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.917
You must have had quite a morning with it.

15:34.583 --> 15:37.166
Did you find anything,
perhaps, inside the jar?

15:37.250 --> 15:41.333
No, but I found 500 dollars taped
to the lid.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.709
That was a pleasant surprise.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.750
And now you're going to be a good person

15:50.834 --> 15:52.583
and give it back, right?

15:52.667 --> 15:54.542
That doesn't sound like me.

15:56.542 --> 15:59.750
Please. If we don't get it back,
we're in big trouble.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.917
Well, I'm not just gonna
give you the cookie jar back.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.750
- I want something in return.
- Like what?

16:06.834 --> 16:08.834
Hmm, let's see.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.917
How about dinner and a show?

16:12.625 --> 16:15.250
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean

16:15.333 --> 16:17.875
I want you to cook me a fancy dinner

16:17.959 --> 16:19.959
and dazzle me with an entertaining show.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.125
Maybe something else?

16:23.500 --> 16:27.458
You could give me
a nice long foot massage.

16:29.458 --> 16:31.875
Dinner and a show it is.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.709
All right, come on out, you guys.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.583
Wow, you guys look great.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.875
You have everything
but glitter in your hair.

16:48.250 --> 16:49.125
Want to buy some?

16:50.709 --> 16:52.542
You guys, this is so exciting!

16:52.625 --> 16:55.208
I think that we're actually
gonna pull this off.

16:55.250 --> 16:59.250
Or not.
Guys, it's the real Duncan sisters.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.458
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

17:00.542 --> 17:01.500
Oh, yes!

17:01.583 --> 17:03.709
Time to make some money!

17:05.250 --> 17:07.959
I was so close to having
my dreams come true.

17:08.041 --> 17:12.458
Oh, everything you worked for
over the last half hour is gone.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.000
We have to get rid of them.

17:16.083 --> 17:19.375
Relax, ladies,
Deuce has it all under control.

17:20.625 --> 17:24.166
So when he says he has it
all under control,

17:24.250 --> 17:26.834
should we be relieved or worried?

17:26.917 --> 17:28.917
Both: Yes!

17:32.000 --> 17:35.375
Over here, and this is your dressing room.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.834
So... After you. Ladies first.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.041
Hey!

17:45.250 --> 17:48.500
As long as you have
some time on your hands...

17:50.583 --> 17:53.083
Make it out to Flynn. That's a "fly"

17:53.166 --> 17:55.458
followed by a "nn-nn"!

18:00.083 --> 18:02.583
Here you go, best table in the house.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.959
And if you like it,
it's for sale tomorrow.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.166
Bonsoir.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.625
For our main course this evening,

18:12.750 --> 18:15.875
ze chef has prepared
his own unique creation.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.542
Voila.

18:18.709 --> 18:19.959
A hot dog?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.875
That's your idea of a dinner?

18:21.959 --> 18:24.208
Wait till you see our idea of a show.

18:25.291 --> 18:27.667
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.667
And thank you for that quiet,

18:30.542 --> 18:32.542
but passionate welcome.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.041
Only on the jokes, hon.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.750

18:43.250 --> 18:44.333

18:45.625 --> 18:48.709
- Not laughing yet.

We're available next week.

And the week after that.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.166
Yeah, but not right now.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.458
Oh goodness. We gotta go.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.458
Okay, goodbye, Chicago!

22:19.166 --> 22:21.542
Here, let's go.

22:21.625 --> 22:23.250
Both: Good luck, Charlie!

22:29.041 --> 22:30.583
Well, Charlie,

22:30.667 --> 22:32.834
um, Chicago was good and bad.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.458
Mom finally got on TV,

22:35.542 --> 22:36.458
good.

22:36.542 --> 22:38.917
Aunt Nell changing her will

22:39.000 --> 22:41.875
to leave all her money
to pet schnauzer mitzi,

22:41.959 --> 22:43.291
bad.

22:44.083 --> 22:47.291
Um, as for me, you know,
I'm just glad to be back home

22:47.375 --> 22:48.875
where everything's normal.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.875
What are you looking at?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.875
Teddy: I don't know.

22:57.959 --> 23:00.792
I am commander Toura.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.041
Not helping.

23:05.917 --> 23:09.125
Well, that's just about
as normal as it gets around this house.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.834
So good luck, Charlie.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.125
So did you bring me anything from Chicago?

23:19.208 --> 23:21.417
Oh yeah, I didn't forget about you.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.750
- Wait until you see what i--
- Hey!

23:27.792 --> 23:29.000
You got me girls?

23:30.333 --> 23:32.709
No, I got you a t-shirt!

23:32.792 --> 23:34.291
What are you guys doing in there?

23:34.375 --> 23:38.208
- Well, we really wanted to see Denver.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

23:38.291 --> 23:40.917
- Oh, I'm glad you liked it.
- What?

23:41.000 --> 23:42.875
No, wait!

23:44.208 --> 23:46.417
Maybe I put it in my carry-on.

23:48.041 --> 23:50.458
Oh!

23:52.875 --> 23:55.000
Hey, babe, miss me?

23:57.375 --> 23:59.291
- No.
- What?

23:59.834 --> 24:02.583
Okay, if that Deuce kid
comes out of my purse,

24:02.667 --> 24:05.417
- I'm gonna scream.
- Deuce: Then I'll just stay in here.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.041
Ooh, mints!
