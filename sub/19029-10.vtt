WEBVTT

00:00.948 --> 00:03.561
Time re changing.
Dr. Kelso had quit,

00:03.661 --> 00:06.204
so the board had made Dr. Cox
the interim chief of medicine.

00:06.304 --> 00:08.833
I don't want everybody
making a big deal out of this.

00:08.933 --> 00:10.576
I'm certainly not going to.

00:10.676 --> 00:12.570
- Dr. Cox...
- Chief Dr. Cox.

00:12.710 --> 00:15.618
Right. The board wants to know when
you're coming to the budget meeting.

00:15.718 --> 00:17.999
Tell them I will be right down.

00:18.099 --> 00:19.492
He's on his way.

00:19.988 --> 00:22.674
- You're not going, are you?
- Not now, not ever.

00:22.774 --> 00:25.263
How exciting is it that
you run this place now?

00:25.363 --> 00:28.167
I'm so proud of you. It's like
a whole new day has dawned.

00:28.267 --> 00:29.746
Do me a big favor there, barboo.

00:29.846 --> 00:31.983
Get that prescription filled for me.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.658
"One chill pill."

00:33.758 --> 00:35.640
That's for you. Unlimited refills.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.519
Hey, chief? I need your approval

00:37.619 --> 00:39.801
on the settlement letter from the
drug company that makes plomox.

00:39.901 --> 00:41.311
Turns out if diabetics take it,

00:41.411 --> 00:43.649
it can cause hypertension
or even death.

00:43.755 --> 00:45.734
Diabetics can die from what?

00:45.834 --> 00:48.445
From not doing the laundry this
morning the way they promised to.

00:48.545 --> 00:51.500
Baby, I ain't never
promised to do the laundry.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.195
I promised I'd try to get to it.

00:54.295 --> 00:55.936
And I wasn't able to.

00:57.037 --> 00:58.843
You know what? I don't have time

00:58.943 --> 01:00.992
for all this plomox crap.

01:01.092 --> 01:02.970
My daughter's having
her shunt removed

01:03.070 --> 01:05.257
Granted, not a
life-threatening procedure,

01:05.372 --> 01:07.736
but still, I have to be
there to hold jordan's claw.

01:07.836 --> 01:10.459
And besides, this stuff
happened on bob's watch.

01:10.559 --> 01:12.339
I'm quite certain he'd
want to take care of it.

01:12.439 --> 01:14.261
Won't you please give him a call?

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:25.194 --> 01:26.546
He wasn't receptive.

01:26.646 --> 01:28.643
Dr. Kelso's absence wasn't bad news

01:28.743 --> 01:30.541
for everyone in the hospital.

01:34.424 --> 01:36.628
- We have a quorum.
- Thank you, ted.

01:36.728 --> 01:37.979
I would like to welcome everyone

01:38.079 --> 01:40.601
to the new brain trust clubhouse,

01:40.701 --> 01:43.059
or, as I like to call
it, the brain house.

01:43.701 --> 01:45.422
Can I make a motion?

01:45.522 --> 01:47.599
If by a motion you mean
a literal motion

01:47.699 --> 01:49.749
in which you simulate
a crude sexual act,

01:49.849 --> 01:51.350
then absolutely not.

01:51.450 --> 01:52.776
- Withdrawn.
- Gentlemen,

01:52.876 --> 01:54.548
the first order
of business is this...

01:54.648 --> 01:58.881
From now on, our tri-daily meetings
will all take place right here.

01:59.021 --> 02:01.357
Can we just take this office?

02:01.457 --> 02:03.577
Ted, we live in a
country called america.

02:03.677 --> 02:05.156
And in america,

02:05.256 --> 02:08.130
every man is free to do
as he or she wishes

02:08.229 --> 02:11.439
and to claim anything he or she
wishes with the simple act of--

02:11.539 --> 02:13.569
Planting a flag.

02:13.797 --> 02:16.549
In the same manner, I claimed
my parking space,

02:16.649 --> 02:19.776
the dead opossum
across the street, and doug's sandwich.

02:20.342 --> 02:22.211
How'd he do that?

02:22.817 --> 02:24.329
Thank you.

02:24.837 --> 02:27.283
So, I forgot
to do laundry this morning,

02:27.383 --> 02:29.029
but I stood up to carla anyway.

02:29.129 --> 02:31.292
Wow. That takes a lot of ball.

02:31.965 --> 02:34.837
See, I made it singular 'cause
you only have one manberry.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.513
Not for long.
I'm getting an implant.

02:37.613 --> 02:41.251
Why? Is it because your balance
is off? I didn't want to say anything,

02:41.351 --> 02:43.255
but you have been turning
left more often than usual.

02:43.355 --> 02:45.833
No. It's not 'cause... Look.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.200
I don't even care. It's not like
anyone notices.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.931
I never stopped noticing.

02:51.770 --> 02:55.447
Anyway, carla wants me to get it, so now
I have to pick out a prosthetic.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.517
Hello, and welcome to ball mart.

03:00.617 --> 03:02.579
Oh, turk, look at all
the different styles!

03:02.679 --> 03:04.970
This one has a diamond stud in it!

03:05.070 --> 03:07.106
And... and this one says
"i'm with stupid"

03:07.206 --> 03:09.195
and has an arrow
pointing to the real one.

03:09.295 --> 03:11.828
This one has a thermostat
and doubles as a hand warmer!

03:11.928 --> 03:15.184
You know, that would be perfect
for next weekend's ice fishing trip.

03:16.109 --> 03:18.803
I can't believe we all fell
through that hole in the ice!

03:18.903 --> 03:20.941
If we don't warm up soon,
we're all going to die.

03:21.061 --> 03:23.742
Hey, why aren't you cold?

03:24.111 --> 03:26.976
All right. Come on.

03:30.907 --> 03:33.250
All right. Now,
nobody makes eye contact.

03:33.350 --> 03:35.152
This is heaven.

03:35.252 --> 03:37.770
Careful, y'all.
That bad boy runs hot.

03:37.909 --> 03:39.668
You're telling me.

03:41.119 --> 03:43.087
Hey, guys. How was fishing?

03:43.187 --> 03:44.663
It was all right.

03:44.763 --> 03:47.480
Best trip ever! Ice fishing five!

03:50.993 --> 03:52.093
Hey.

03:53.045 --> 03:55.123
You're going to be late
for your shift.

03:56.602 --> 03:58.864
I got to stop
with the long fantasies.

03:58.964 --> 04:00.421
They're never worth it.

04:01.735 --> 04:04.859

04:09.219 --> 04:13.655
For The High-Five Team and SeriesSub.com

04:17.928 --> 04:20.608
All right, kid. I expect
updates on my daughter

04:20.708 --> 04:23.153
every 15 minutes. Or what, perry?

04:23.253 --> 04:24.842
You will be let go.

04:26.589 --> 04:28.627
I love that you're the boss now.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.469
Honest to god, it almost
makes you seem attractive.

04:31.569 --> 04:34.533
Thank you. How in the hell did
kelso deal with all this paperwork?

04:35.544 --> 04:36.957
What do you want, ted?

04:37.057 --> 04:39.047
Now that you're chief,
i'm your number 2.

04:39.147 --> 04:41.423
I think you'll find me
more than qualified.

04:41.523 --> 04:43.517
I'm hardworking, reliable,

04:43.617 --> 04:47.489
and I recently figured out
how to open up my briefcase.

04:47.589 --> 04:50.579
Congrats. Take a look at that for me,
and grab me a cup of coffee.

04:50.679 --> 04:52.190
No sweat.

04:58.353 --> 05:00.480
Ohh, I just had it.

05:01.223 --> 05:03.436
- Dr. Cox...
- Chief Dr. Cox.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.710
Hey. Your initials are c.d.c.

05:05.810 --> 05:07.748
That was my nickname
in my sorority.

05:08.285 --> 05:10.476
- "crying drunk chick."
- Of course.

05:10.576 --> 05:13.089
Anyway. You know
that plomox lawsuit?

05:13.189 --> 05:15.376
Well, last year, I prescribed it
to one of my diabetic patients

05:15.476 --> 05:17.085
who might be entitled to
some of that settlement money,

05:17.185 --> 05:18.633
so I was just wondering
if you could have someone

05:18.733 --> 05:20.282
cover my patients
while I go meet with him.

05:20.382 --> 05:22.607
Whatever it takes to
get you to stop talking.

05:22.707 --> 05:24.865
Hey, I'll drive you if we
can pick up sam from daycare

05:24.965 --> 05:26.889
- on the way back.
- Yeah. Thanks.

05:26.989 --> 05:27.945
Cool.

05:28.045 --> 05:29.744
I just want you to know

05:29.868 --> 05:32.380
my thoughts and prayers
are with your daughter.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.395
Can you make him stop talking?

05:35.495 --> 05:37.250
I've tried for 7 years.

05:37.350 --> 05:38.539
It can't be done.

05:40.551 --> 05:43.255
Ok. Izzie is down for her nap.

05:43.355 --> 05:44.848
What's with the champagne?

05:44.948 --> 05:47.688
Celebration. Izzie
sleeping through the night

05:47.788 --> 05:50.377
and us finally finding
a nanny who's not a thief.

05:50.477 --> 05:52.760
I still don't think we
needed to fire Mrs. Norton

05:52.860 --> 05:55.242
just because she ate the
last of your rice pudding.

05:55.342 --> 05:57.543
I wrote my name on it, ok?

05:57.643 --> 06:00.303
No! It's... no, wait. I wrote my...

06:00.403 --> 06:01.727
Sorry.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.145
The point is, for the first
time since you were pregnant,

06:05.245 --> 06:08.232
I feel like we finally
have time to be us again.

06:08.332 --> 06:10.030
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it!

06:10.130 --> 06:11.656
- Let me do it.
- Baby, come on. No. No.

06:11.756 --> 06:13.463
- I know how to do it.
- Just c... look.

06:13.563 --> 06:16.218
Baby, I got it. Look what...

06:18.515 --> 06:19.886
Baby...

06:20.385 --> 06:21.483
To us.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.419
Ted, what are you doing?

06:26.205 --> 06:29.118
I'm bringing a cup of coffee to Dr. Cox.

06:29.218 --> 06:31.197
Why? That's not your job.

06:31.297 --> 06:32.714
Come on. You got
a fresh start here.

06:32.814 --> 06:34.927
You going to stick to the same
dynamic you had with Dr. Kelso?

06:35.027 --> 06:36.442
Remember how that started?

06:38.033 --> 06:41.897
Hi, Dr. Kelso. Theodore
buckland, licensed attorney.

06:41.997 --> 06:43.649
Ted, Before you get started...

06:43.749 --> 06:45.463
And trust me, I hate asking this...

06:45.563 --> 06:49.385
Would you mind doing me one tiny,
little, non-work-related favor?

06:49.485 --> 06:51.451
No problem, man.

06:52.130 --> 06:54.723
Make sure you get the
backside of that grill.

06:54.823 --> 06:56.800
I hit the neighbor's cat
last night.

06:56.900 --> 07:00.182
Quick little bastard. I had
to cross 2 lanes to get him.

07:03.873 --> 07:05.941
My point is, you could
be a whole new ted.

07:06.041 --> 07:07.565
Now, come on. Turn around.

07:07.665 --> 07:10.873
Chest out. Stand tall.
Chin up. Blink your eyes real fast.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.841
Just kidding. That was
for me. Give me that.

07:14.090 --> 07:16.828
- Don't you have to clean that up?
- Not on tuesdays.

07:16.928 --> 07:20.009
I want you to get in there and
tell Dr. Cox what's what.

07:23.422 --> 07:25.726
- Dr. Cox?
- Chief Dr. Cox.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.439
Chief Dr. Cox, i'm a lawyer.

07:28.539 --> 07:30.567
I shouldn't have to get you coffee.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.553
How do you feel about that?

07:32.653 --> 07:34.458
Can't even pretend to care.

07:34.558 --> 07:36.326
Fine. No more getting me coffee.

07:36.426 --> 07:37.974
Yeah!

07:38.103 --> 07:39.935
Yeah!

07:40.246 --> 07:42.071
Yeah!

07:42.295 --> 07:44.987
Is this really that
big of a moment for you?

07:45.409 --> 07:47.315
Yeah!

07:48.533 --> 07:50.581
Ugh. My patient's running late.

07:50.681 --> 07:52.319
Why are we meeting him here?

07:52.419 --> 07:54.117
Because the last time I met
a patient at their house,

07:54.217 --> 07:55.506
I ended up at the news.

07:55.606 --> 07:57.622
- Was that the crack raid?
- It was.

07:59.669 --> 08:01.266
We're just going to wait?

08:01.366 --> 08:04.139
I wish turk was here. I wonder
what he's doing right now.

08:04.239 --> 08:06.463
I just want to make sure
everything's normal.

08:06.563 --> 08:08.805
I'm only feeling one testicle.

08:10.005 --> 08:11.504
Yeah, you are.

08:12.879 --> 08:14.870
Why do you wish turk was here?

08:14.970 --> 08:16.528
I don't know. We goof around.

08:16.628 --> 08:18.517
Why can't you goof around with me?

08:18.617 --> 08:21.095
Elliot, our friendship is
different than mine and turk's.

08:21.195 --> 08:23.505
I can goof around, j.d.

08:23.605 --> 08:25.488
I can goof around hard.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.124
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:27.224 --> 08:28.635
Then follow me.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.111
And now, we wait.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.585
Hey, Mr. Middle eastern manager guy.

08:43.684 --> 08:46.415
I hope you got a tight
grip on that drink.

08:46.589 --> 08:48.405
One cheeseburger and fries...

08:56.991 --> 08:59.952
All right. You're going to hold on
to that new confidence, yeah?

09:00.052 --> 09:03.112
There's cindy. Let me see
the new ted in action.

09:03.212 --> 09:04.532
Hey, cindy.

09:04.632 --> 09:06.845
I want to make you pregnant.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.910
How did I do?

09:10.010 --> 09:11.963
For the first time, I'm
looking down at your bald head,

09:12.063 --> 09:13.904
and I'm not just seeing
my reflection.

09:14.004 --> 09:16.363
I'm seeing a man. Come on.

09:20.012 --> 09:21.818
Nice work on the renovation, boys.

09:21.918 --> 09:24.358
We also had an organ donor
come into the morgue today,

09:24.458 --> 09:27.375
so I'd like to introduce
our new mascot...

09:27.686 --> 09:29.911
Barry morris' brain.

09:30.011 --> 09:31.959
I dub that gross. Second?

09:32.070 --> 09:34.831
Ok. Noting the minutes as gross.

09:34.931 --> 09:37.205
Now, next order
of business... activities.

09:37.305 --> 09:39.249
I had an idea for tonight.

09:39.349 --> 09:43.259
- Why don't we play cards?
- It's tuesday, ted.

09:43.359 --> 09:45.612
On tuesdays, you guys clean
the hospital, remember?

09:45.712 --> 09:47.383
We went over this when
I threw down your coffee.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.298
I want to play cards!

09:52.738 --> 09:54.915
I am not being ridiculous.

09:55.033 --> 09:57.991
To be safe, I'm going to line
your boxers with bubble wrap.

09:58.091 --> 10:00.003
- Esta loca.
- Look.

10:00.103 --> 10:02.167
We haven't talked about
whether we want another kid,

10:02.267 --> 10:03.928
and if something happened,

10:04.533 --> 10:07.139
I just don't that
decision to be made for us.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.974
No decision's been made.

10:09.074 --> 10:10.521
Are you sure?

10:10.621 --> 10:12.670
I know there's only one down there,

10:12.770 --> 10:14.127
but he's the better one.

10:14.227 --> 10:16.987
He's like tina turner
after she left ike...

10:17.087 --> 10:18.455
Stronger, more confident,

10:18.555 --> 10:20.863
and is going to have a
very successful solo career.

10:20.963 --> 10:22.114
Ok?

10:22.673 --> 10:23.929
Ok.

10:26.758 --> 10:28.370
It's funny every time.

10:28.470 --> 10:29.769
Are you Dr. Reed?

10:29.869 --> 10:32.440
- I'm adam candy.
- I never treated you.

10:32.540 --> 10:34.679
Oh, great. I called the wrong one.

10:34.779 --> 10:36.830
Wait. If you weren't my patient,

10:36.930 --> 10:38.921
then why did you agree
to meet me here?

10:39.021 --> 10:41.900
- You said there might be money.
- Well, there isn't. J.d., let's go.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.494
Wait. This looks promising.

10:44.594 --> 10:47.325
The truth is, we bring most
of our trouble on ourselves,

10:47.425 --> 10:50.134
whether it's creating a
monster in your own ranks...

10:50.234 --> 10:52.389
Ok. So, everyone has their mop.

10:54.553 --> 10:58.228
Why do we always have
to do what you want to do?

11:00.826 --> 11:03.210
Or pulling a prank that causes
an irate customer

11:03.310 --> 11:05.239
to yank a fast food manager
through a window

11:05.339 --> 11:06.703
and drive off with him.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.309
What are you doing?

11:10.113 --> 11:11.473
That's new.

11:12.125 --> 11:14.958
Yep. Even something as simple
as opening a bottle of champagne

11:15.058 --> 11:16.870
can have huge ramifications.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.499
Still bubbly.

11:18.947 --> 11:21.393
So, are we still celebrating
the same thing as before?

11:21.493 --> 11:25.100
No. I want another baby, now.

11:33.545 --> 11:35.856
You want another minute
to think about it?

11:38.206 --> 11:39.816
Yeah. Ok.

11:44.598 --> 11:47.733
The manager's fine.
Luckily, he maced the driver

11:47.833 --> 11:50.044
with a packet of hot sauce
before they got to the freeway.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.736
Ok. He doesn't know you
caused this, so stay calm.

11:52.836 --> 11:55.635
- Any more information I should know?
- yes. But not about this.

11:55.735 --> 11:57.691
We're doctors. We like
to give out health tips.

11:57.791 --> 12:00.452
You should wear sunscreen, even
with your dark complexion.

12:00.552 --> 12:02.361
Nice save.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.303
We did it. We put up the sign.

12:04.403 --> 12:06.118
You should also stay hydrated.

12:06.218 --> 12:08.401
J.d., we have to take
responsibility, ok?

12:08.501 --> 12:09.908
You going to cuff us?

12:10.008 --> 12:11.688
For a paper sign? No.

12:11.788 --> 12:13.726
You know how many people
get shot around here?

12:13.826 --> 12:16.828
She probably does. You know she
got caught on tv in a crack den?

12:16.928 --> 12:18.035
Why?

12:18.135 --> 12:20.290
I'm sure he probably
knows. It's on the docket.

12:21.739 --> 12:24.409
Ok. There's one thing we have to remember,

12:24.509 --> 12:27.628
and that's that I decide
what's best for the brain trust.

12:27.728 --> 12:29.881
I thought this was a democracy.

12:29.981 --> 12:31.738
Oh. Then it's just
miscommunication.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.048
No. The brain trust is
a dictatorship

12:34.148 --> 12:36.392
masquerading as a democracy.

12:36.492 --> 12:39.603
I know that you all
remember when I seized power

12:39.703 --> 12:42.511
during the revolution
of '02, when I overthrew kyle

12:42.611 --> 12:44.976
during the battle of the
basement supply closet.

12:45.076 --> 12:47.227
Or have you forgotten your history?

12:47.327 --> 12:51.510
Well, maybe I'll just
start my own brain trust.

12:51.610 --> 12:54.100
You can't. Brain trust
is a registered trademark.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.289
I own that name. And chanel.

12:56.389 --> 13:00.084
Well, maybe i'll just call it
the brain bunch.

13:00.184 --> 13:01.629
You wouldn't dare.

13:01.729 --> 13:03.473
Whoo! Brain bunch!

13:03.573 --> 13:05.747
I'm staying. Brain trust!

13:07.002 --> 13:09.189
You mind switching? You
know this guy makes me crazy.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.506
Oh, fine.

13:11.254 --> 13:14.087
- Whoo! Brain trust!
- Brain bunch!

13:20.762 --> 13:23.651
Ok. I'm ready to tell you what I think.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.757
I think pregnancy
was really tough on you

13:26.857 --> 13:29.140
and the post-partum stuff put
a strain on our relationship.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.909
And we finally got our life back, and
so, it's really hard to think about

13:32.009 --> 13:33.951
having another baby right now.

13:34.086 --> 13:35.709
There, I said it.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.927
Kick my ass now, if you want.

13:38.098 --> 13:40.244
Turk, I'm not mad.

13:40.344 --> 13:43.066
To do this, we both have to be onboard.

13:43.946 --> 13:45.167
Just...

13:45.687 --> 13:47.974
Promise me you'll
keep thinking about it.

13:48.432 --> 13:50.479
Yeah. Come here.

13:52.054 --> 13:54.773
Hey. Did you know that
women actually have a hormone

13:54.873 --> 13:57.133
that helps them forget all
that horrible pregnancy stuff?

13:57.233 --> 13:59.850
Really? That's interesting,
'cause men have a hormone

13:59.950 --> 14:02.300
that helps them forget about
sleeping with fat chicks.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.829
You used that hormone a lot when
you were younger, didn't you?

14:07.333 --> 14:08.515
Frick.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.421
I can't find adam candy.

14:10.521 --> 14:12.809
All right. What was he wearing
the last time you saw him?

14:12.909 --> 14:14.730
J.d., that was 3 years ago.

14:14.830 --> 14:17.063
Why do you care so much
if this guy gets money?

14:17.604 --> 14:19.719
I didn't ask for your help, ok?

14:22.252 --> 14:23.923
What's going on here?

14:24.023 --> 14:26.348
This is a brain trust table.

14:26.477 --> 14:28.877
I don't see your flag on it.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.661
That's 'cause we're
not using flags anymore.

14:31.853 --> 14:34.777
We're using, uh... Napkin holders.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.273
There. Brain trust table.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.061
Those 2 should have
their own sitcom.

14:44.138 --> 14:45.895
I'm a lawyer

14:45.995 --> 14:47.467
I'm a janitor

14:47.567 --> 14:50.515
together, we adopted
a cute little kid

14:50.615 --> 14:52.893
we're legal custodians

14:53.440 --> 14:54.677
get it?

14:55.995 --> 14:57.580
I'd watch that show.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.788
Would you?

14:59.664 --> 15:02.699
Dr. Cox please report
to the board meeting?

15:02.799 --> 15:03.952
Dr. Cox.

15:04.052 --> 15:05.710
Chief Dr. Cox.

15:05.810 --> 15:08.310
Correction Chief Dr. Cox.

15:08.410 --> 15:10.670
- That was weird.
- Nah, it's not so weird.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.922
I'm just having them do the
announcements right over there.

15:13.430 --> 15:16.430
Hey, jordan, you look nice today.

15:17.591 --> 15:19.185
Thank you.

15:19.677 --> 15:21.744
What's the deal there, gumball?

15:21.844 --> 15:24.098
Carla wants another kid,
but I'm not sure yet.

15:24.410 --> 15:26.696
I can't help but go to
a dark place, you know.

15:26.796 --> 15:29.259
We're already blessed with this
beautiful, healthy daughter.

15:29.359 --> 15:30.993
What if the amino comes back

15:31.093 --> 15:33.263
and it's the worst possible news...

15:34.195 --> 15:35.855
It's another girl?

15:36.004 --> 15:38.347
- You're having another baby?
- I don't know yet.

15:38.447 --> 15:41.008
I'll tell you what I don't know,
what I'm going to do about new ted.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.299
Who's he talking to?

15:42.399 --> 15:44.726
Another baby would be so cool, dude.

15:44.826 --> 15:47.095
- Old ted was cool.
- Which one is ted?

15:47.195 --> 15:48.950
Did he have a baby
with the janitor?

15:49.050 --> 15:50.357
Only in their sitcom.

15:50.457 --> 15:52.328
Legal custodians

15:52.747 --> 15:53.997
get it?

15:54.243 --> 15:56.258
You people are driving me crazy.

15:56.358 --> 15:58.101
You know who's driving me crazy? Elliot.

15:58.201 --> 16:01.175
She's obsessed with getting money for
one of her patients who took plomox.

16:01.275 --> 16:03.077
I should have more patience
with new ted.

16:03.177 --> 16:05.017
He means the other kind
of patience, right?

16:05.117 --> 16:07.041
I'm not sure. I'm lost.

16:07.141 --> 16:08.443
I'm lost, too.

16:08.543 --> 16:09.758
Me, too.

16:09.858 --> 16:11.432
How do I make this decision?

16:11.532 --> 16:13.339
That decision has
already been made.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.060
If carla wants to
have another baby,

16:15.160 --> 16:16.499
she's going to have another baby.

16:16.599 --> 16:17.993
The one thing you got to focus on

16:18.093 --> 16:20.177
is getting something out
of this deal for yourself.

16:20.277 --> 16:22.619
I created new ted, so I
should deal with it myself.

16:22.719 --> 16:24.268
Thank you very much.

16:24.404 --> 16:26.448
Glad to be of help. I'm out.

16:26.548 --> 16:28.458
You want to get
something good from carla?

16:28.558 --> 16:31.994
You got to just pretend that you
really don't even want another kid.

16:32.094 --> 16:33.237
But that's not true.

16:33.337 --> 16:36.013
Yeah, but you walk around this
hospital acting like you have 2 testicles,

16:36.113 --> 16:39.000
- and that's damn sure not true.
- And I'm in.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.902
We're having a fake one put in.

16:41.002 --> 16:42.824
If carla wants to have
a baby so badly,

16:42.924 --> 16:44.554
why would she insist
you have a surgery

16:44.654 --> 16:46.818
that could potential harm
your one working nut?

16:46.918 --> 16:49.200
Carla doesn't want the prosthetic.

16:49.472 --> 16:52.109
- I do.
- Why would you lie?

16:52.505 --> 16:55.173
Sometimes, you say you're
doing something for someone else

16:55.273 --> 16:57.287
when you really want
to do it for yourself.

16:57.387 --> 16:59.264
I get it. Maybe that's
what elliot's doing.

16:59.364 --> 17:01.890
- What in the hell are you talking about?
- Oh, I'm just doing this thing

17:01.990 --> 17:04.481
where I use a slice of wisdom
from someone else's life

17:04.580 --> 17:06.564
to solve a problem in my own life.

17:06.664 --> 17:08.061
Seems coincidental.

17:08.162 --> 17:10.042
And yet, I do it almost every week.

17:11.554 --> 17:15.559
Good news. Jennifer's procedure
is done, and we get to leave this room.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.034
I'm not quite sure which
one I'm more excited about.

17:18.134 --> 17:19.545
Come, now.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.313
It was never about him, was it?

17:29.568 --> 17:31.203
It was about you.

17:31.303 --> 17:33.193
Your patient adam candy...

17:33.293 --> 17:34.829
You thought you killed him.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.883
Forgive me for being one
of those weird doctors

17:36.983 --> 17:39.183
who's concerned they might
have killed a human being.

17:39.495 --> 17:41.905
Well, I checked
with county records,

17:42.005 --> 17:44.460
and, uh, your patient did die.

17:45.866 --> 17:47.686
He was hit by a truck.

17:47.883 --> 17:49.089
Yes.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.336
So, it wasn't the plomox?
He didn't have a heart attack?

17:53.436 --> 17:54.907
He may have, you know,

17:55.007 --> 17:58.036
in the split second before the truck
hit him. It's hard to know for sure.

17:59.117 --> 18:01.096
Why didn't you tell me
the truth, elliot?

18:01.196 --> 18:02.922
What, because we're
such great friends?

18:03.037 --> 18:06.973
J.d., after hanging out with me for
10 minutes at that fast food place,

18:07.073 --> 18:08.841
you were wishing
that turk was there.

18:08.941 --> 18:10.941
And that hurt your feelings?

18:11.041 --> 18:12.906
I was psyched to hang out with you,

18:13.006 --> 18:14.731
so psyched that I even caused

18:14.831 --> 18:17.762
some middle eastern man to
get kidnapped and driven away,

18:17.862 --> 18:19.915
which is probably
the exact kind of thing

18:20.015 --> 18:21.917
he came to this country to avoid.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.825
I'm off, and as you can see,

18:24.925 --> 18:28.146
sam is jonesing
for his afternoon latte.

18:28.839 --> 18:30.343
Want to join us?

18:30.717 --> 18:33.016
Why? Because you feel guilty?

18:33.668 --> 18:35.931
No. Because I want
to hang out with you.

18:42.615 --> 18:44.151
Don't look at him.

18:44.251 --> 18:46.906
There are many ways
to restore a relationship.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.816
Whether it's by extending
an olive branch...

18:50.916 --> 18:52.974
What the hell are you doing here?

18:53.074 --> 18:54.649
Take it easy. Just hear me out.

18:54.749 --> 18:57.658
I would like to call to order
tonight's meeting of the brain trust.

18:57.758 --> 19:00.932
First item of business,
tomorrow night's activities. Ted?

19:01.032 --> 19:03.649
I believe you think it
would be fun to play cards.

19:03.749 --> 19:06.117
Well, as a matter of fact, I did.

19:06.217 --> 19:08.245
Or by striking a bargain.

19:08.895 --> 19:11.168
Still not sure
about this baby thing.

19:11.346 --> 19:14.684
I just think we've been so connected
lately, and I really don't want to lose that.

19:14.784 --> 19:16.504
How can I convince you
that we won't?

19:16.604 --> 19:18.486
Agree to have sex with
me every day for 2 months.

19:18.586 --> 19:19.752
- One month.
- ok.

19:19.852 --> 19:21.544
But that means if I
tap you on your shoulder

19:21.644 --> 19:23.216
and you're in
the middle of something,

19:23.316 --> 19:25.943
you got to drop it like
it's hot and give it to daddy.

19:26.171 --> 19:27.996
- Deal.
- Deal.

19:28.096 --> 19:30.909
Or by making a good
friend feel like just that.

19:31.009 --> 19:34.111
Hey, guys, the barista
said sam looked like us.

19:34.819 --> 19:37.055
It's so weird how people
think that we're the parents.

19:37.155 --> 19:38.942
Well, I understand why
they think he looks like me,

19:39.042 --> 19:41.063
'cause we both have blue eyes
and have the little button nose,

19:41.163 --> 19:43.162
but you, it's probably
the finger toes,

19:43.262 --> 19:45.935
'cause you both have crazy long
toes. So, What do you guys think?

19:46.035 --> 19:47.474
Where did they go?

19:47.574 --> 19:50.087
I don't know. I don't know.

19:50.577 --> 19:52.637
You are the cutest.

19:52.737 --> 19:54.823
He loves that. Do it again.
