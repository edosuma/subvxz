00:04.250 --> 00:05.510
Linus: <i>Previously on</i> Stitchers...

00:05.550 --> 00:08.189
I need to appoint someone to
take all my responsibilities.

00:08.220 --> 00:12.320
Please tell me I didn't lose a
potentially career-changing promotion

00:12.360 --> 00:14.840
just so you could date the new brunette?

00:14.870 --> 00:16.010
We are not okay.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.410
Wait, you're handling this stitch?

00:17.430 --> 00:20.050
He's got the yips.
He's worried about you.

00:20.070 --> 00:22.730
And that is why we need
to keep your mother safe,

00:22.770 --> 00:25.300
<i>so that after stitching
technology is perfected</i>

00:25.320 --> 00:30.680
we can stitch into her living
evolved brain and map it completely.

00:30.710 --> 00:32.420
- Good talk.
- Hmm.

00:32.450 --> 00:34.560
Woman: <i>Her oxytocin levels
are rising in response to</i>

00:34.590 --> 00:36.130
<i>what she's seeing in the stitch.</i>

00:36.160 --> 00:37.620
Things are heating up.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.850
The more physically
intimate you guys are,

00:39.880 --> 00:42.450
the more it's going to mess
with your ability to stitch.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.510
We have to do this if
we're gonna save my mother.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.920
Oh, I know. I'm with you.

00:48.380 --> 00:51.480
- How are those oxytocin levels?
- Holding steady. Yours?

00:53.590 --> 00:55.460
Never lower.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:20.780 --> 01:22.780
Camille: You're doing it all wrong.

01:22.810 --> 01:25.950
- What?
- The walk of shame.

01:25.980 --> 01:27.980
There's no walk. There's no shame.

01:28.020 --> 01:30.290
I gotta say,
I give you and Cameron a lot of credit

01:30.310 --> 01:32.210
for holding out as long as you did

01:32.240 --> 01:36.800
before finally throwing oxytocin to the
wind in favor of the other big "O."

01:36.830 --> 01:41.700
We didn't. It was more like Kubrick,
a kiss, and a cuddle.

01:41.730 --> 01:45.390
We're keeping things
very PG around here.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.300
- And your night?
- Unh.

01:48.330 --> 01:49.930
Hard "R."

01:49.950 --> 01:51.790
Cameron's really able to
keep his hands off you?

01:51.820 --> 01:54.040
He's got incredible willpower.

01:55.540 --> 01:56.540
He's fine.

01:56.580 --> 01:59.160
98.

01:59.730 --> 02:04.090
99, 100.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.250
Yo, bro, how long you
gonna keep this up for?

02:07.290 --> 02:09.990
As long as it takes for you to
work up a damn oxytocin filter.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.160
- Feet.
- Look at the bright side.

02:12.190 --> 02:14.090
Look how much money you're
gonna save on your gas bills

02:14.130 --> 02:15.530
with all those cold showers you take.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.730
Oh, cold showers aren't a thing.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.700
And money, I have.

02:20.740 --> 02:24.140
What I don't have is a
functioning oxytocin filter.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.810
- Can we talk about your yips for a moment?
- No.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.310
Look, I get it,
you're freaked out about Kirsten.

02:29.340 --> 02:32.290
- Not talking about it.
- And you're afraid of her getting hurt.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.280
And that fear has
manifested itself into yips.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.460
- Still not talking about it.
- I'm just saying.

02:36.480 --> 02:37.990
I agree with you.

02:38.020 --> 02:40.770
You should let Camille
pilot stitches for a while.

02:44.030 --> 02:46.490
- I'm a good listener if you ever need one.
- No.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.530
Thanks, but I'm good.

02:48.560 --> 02:52.270
For now, I'll do me, you do the filter.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.560
You got it, boss.

02:53.580 --> 02:56.480
So define "a cuddle."
Was there spooning?

02:56.500 --> 03:00.210
Instead of you asking me inappropriate
questions and me avoiding them,

03:01.440 --> 03:03.540
can I interest you in a little trouble?

03:03.580 --> 03:04.730
Go on.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.590
To save my mother,
we need to perfect stitching, right?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.250
Go on!

03:09.280 --> 03:12.650
And to perfect stitching, we need
to fully map the human brain, right?

03:12.690 --> 03:15.360
And now that Cameron has
me piloting the stitches...

03:15.390 --> 03:19.430
Then we can spend a little more time
in the regions that we need to map.

03:19.460 --> 03:22.200
- Okay, except that we don't...
- Yes, we do.

03:22.230 --> 03:24.460
I hacked into the lab's mind map system.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.700
Our progress, mapping the brain.

03:26.730 --> 03:29.240
Pulsing sections are everything
we've already treaded.

03:29.270 --> 03:32.570
And the static areas are regions
that we haven't fully mapped yet.

03:32.610 --> 03:35.120
They'll be our focus moving forward.

03:35.320 --> 03:38.070
Okay, so, just to be clear,
you want me to go behind the back of

03:38.090 --> 03:39.340
and flip a hearty bird

03:39.370 --> 03:42.200
to my employer,
the National Security Agency?

03:42.230 --> 03:44.860
- Absolutely.
- It's about damn time.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.770
- Cameron doesn't know you want to do this?
- No. And he can't find out.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.170
He's obsessed with my safety, and
lingering anywhere long enough to map it

03:51.200 --> 03:52.440
would just completely freak him out.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.470
And also, you don't go to your boss

03:54.510 --> 03:55.940
when you want to break protocol.

03:55.980 --> 03:58.680
You come to someone like me.

03:58.710 --> 04:01.490
Now what we need is a body.

04:26.910 --> 04:30.810
<i>♪ Take me inside ♪</i>

04:32.610 --> 04:36.210

04:45.620 --> 04:47.560
Vic's a John Doe, mid-to-late 30s.

04:47.590 --> 04:49.460
Shot once in the chest
before being thrown

04:49.500 --> 04:51.900
or falling off the roof
of the Windwood Hotel.

04:51.930 --> 04:53.260
Tattoo on his right forearm

04:53.300 --> 04:55.370
is running through
image recognition now.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.300
Killer also shot off
his left index finger.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.270
That reminds me, we're
out of baby carrots.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.280
Finger's missing.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.930
However,
terracotta shards were in the wound.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.560
So we dug out the bullet
from a tile in the roof

05:04.580 --> 05:06.250
where we know his hand was held down.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.550
We're running ballistics on it now.

05:07.590 --> 05:09.690
Why shoot off his finger?

05:09.720 --> 05:11.620
Maybe the killer was
trying to make a point.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.430
No pun intended.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.820
Maybe I should pilot this.

05:17.850 --> 05:18.800
Both: No.

05:18.830 --> 05:22.000
You might still have a
little performance anxiety.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.270
She means in
a stitch kind of way.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.380
Of course.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.970
It's the only frame of
reference I have on you.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.460
You can try naming all
the state capitals.

05:30.610 --> 05:34.270
- I hear that helps.
- I don't have performance... anx...

05:35.210 --> 05:36.780
Whatever.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.560
You can pilot.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.300
Here's my map.

05:44.340 --> 05:47.070
This must be what Beyonce feels
like when she drops a secret album.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.080
After you upload it,
watch out for Linus.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.400
He'll be the first one
to notice something's up.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.220
You know, you could always think of
the starting lineup for the '69 Mets.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.230
I don't know...
gosh, you're enjoying this, aren't you?

05:59.250 --> 06:00.320
I am.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.570
Lights to 20%, please.

06:06.610 --> 06:09.640
I need a go, no-go for
stitch neurosync. Life-Sci?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.380
Go.

06:10.410 --> 06:11.940
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.090
- Engineering?
- Go.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.290
You can also think of all the
different kinds of pickles.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.070
Works for me.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.850
- Communications?
- Go.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.710
- Medical?
- Go.

06:21.740 --> 06:25.270
- Com check. One-two, one-two.
- Let's get into trouble.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.040
All right. Obligatory movie quote?

06:27.070 --> 06:28.780
- "I see dead people."
- Too easy.

06:28.810 --> 06:30.340
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

06:30.370 --> 06:35.360
In three, two, one... mark.

06:48.390 --> 06:49.630
This is odd.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.090
Describe "odd."

06:52.130 --> 06:56.770
I'm in a gallery of some kind,
but it's deserted. No people.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.130
- And I'm sensing something.
- What?

06:59.170 --> 07:00.320
What are you sensing?

07:00.350 --> 07:03.370
I'm sensing that it's
not a real art gallery.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.570
I can't explain it. John Doe isn't here.

07:05.610 --> 07:08.240
- Does she need to bounce?
- Kirsten, do you need to bounce?

07:08.280 --> 07:11.150
No. I must be here for a reason.
Let's stick around a while.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.240
Linus, where is she?

07:12.260 --> 07:14.550
Part of the brain responsible
for symbols and imagery.

07:14.580 --> 07:16.890
It's an area we haven't mapped fully.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.190
- Might explain what she's feeling.
- Move her somewhere else.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.260
- No, let her poke around.
- Camille.

07:21.290 --> 07:22.170
My stitch, my rules.

07:22.190 --> 07:24.290
My lab, my orders.
Mission clock's running.

07:24.330 --> 07:26.840
Got a memory hotspot in another
region that's mapped a little better.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.570
- Move her.
- Linus...

07:28.600 --> 07:31.010
Isolate memory image and
grab what you can, thanks.

07:31.810 --> 07:34.560
Did I make a mistake trusting you?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.310
No, sir. Kirsten, pressure's on to move.

07:37.340 --> 07:39.410
No, wait, I see something.

07:40.850 --> 07:44.220
It's like a dollhouse scene,
but on a display stand.

07:46.530 --> 07:49.430
Just got a hit on John Doe's tattoo.
British Royal Marines.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.730
He's a sailor?

07:50.750 --> 07:52.250
Apparently who plays with dolls.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.660
There are weird things.

07:53.690 --> 07:57.760
There's a swan and a sword.

07:57.780 --> 07:59.290
And a patch of grass.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.160
An apple tree.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.870
There's four toy soldiers marching
underneath it, around a golden snake.

08:06.900 --> 08:08.770
Any of you geniuses know
what any of this means?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.650
Sorry, I don't speak bizarro.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.510
There's a tile on another pedestal.
A cow standing on it.

08:15.550 --> 08:20.050
And there's another golden snake
wrapped around the cow. Like a hug.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.420
This is the kinda dream I have after,
like, three tequilas.

08:22.450 --> 08:25.890
John Doe encrypted his memories.
This is image-based encoding.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.720
Move her to the language
processing cortex.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.890
I kinda feel like there's
more to explore here.

08:29.930 --> 08:32.260
Mission clock at two minutes
and forty-three seconds.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.460
There's no time. John Doe created
an image-based language for himself.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.549
We need to be in the
language processing cortex.

08:37.570 --> 08:40.679
- Cameron, I just think...
- I don't care what you think.

08:42.960 --> 08:46.830
- This stitch is over. Tell her to bounce.
- Hey, talk to me, please.

08:48.350 --> 08:52.020
- Death moment approaching.
- Playtime's over. Death moment is upon us.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.430
You okay?

09:00.460 --> 09:02.100
- I'm fine.
- What were you two playing at?

09:02.120 --> 09:04.220
- Nothing.
- Reckless or stupid?

09:04.260 --> 09:06.660
Oh, I don't like your tone, Goodkin.

09:06.690 --> 09:09.530
You kept Kirsten in an unmapped
area for longer than I wanted to,

09:09.560 --> 09:11.280
so are you reckless or stupid?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.270
Well, that depends. Are you the lab
director or a flustered boyfriend?

09:14.300 --> 09:16.970
Neither. Right now, I'm the guy who's
wondering if he was wrong for trusting you.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.070
Okay, guys, let's just dial
the temperature down here.

09:20.570 --> 09:23.070
It's my fault. I told Camille to do it,

09:23.110 --> 09:26.640
um, to beef up mind mapping
in areas we're weakest in.

09:26.680 --> 09:29.850
It'll prepare us better
to stitch into my mother.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.960
Did you at least see
who killed John Doe?

09:32.980 --> 09:35.530
Yeah. A golden snake,
whatever that means.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.220
I'll tell you what it means.

09:37.290 --> 09:39.040
It means John Doe built a mind palace,

09:39.060 --> 09:42.240
a memory technique for people who
need to keep their secrets secret.

09:42.270 --> 09:46.500
- Royal Marines plus mind palace equals...
- John Doe was a spy.

09:52.420 --> 09:54.250
More gold.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.850
More like gold-gold.

09:58.870 --> 10:02.670
- That's it.
- And save and swipe.

10:03.850 --> 10:07.400
- Kirsten: Cow. Snake.
- Cowsnake. Here it is.

10:07.420 --> 10:10.360
A harmless snake encouraged
by farmers to live in barns.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.630
John Doe's snake was far from harmless.

10:12.690 --> 10:15.490
- What about the soldiers?
- There were four of them. Marching.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.960
- Cameron, where you going?
- Rogue.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.500
I'm going rogue.
A concept you're familiar with.

10:25.570 --> 10:28.000
While you're gone, I'll follow
up with Fisher on ballistics.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.740
And we can check out
the crime scene, uh,

10:29.770 --> 10:31.960
see if there's anything there
that ties into the images.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.210
Yay, a field trip.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.010
I'll go with you.

10:44.050 --> 10:46.960
I could apologize again if
it would make you happy.

10:46.990 --> 10:48.360
Look, you know I've accepted

10:48.390 --> 10:49.830
prioritizing your mother over us,

10:49.860 --> 10:52.090
but then you go behind my
back and make this secret plan

10:52.110 --> 10:53.690
for the stitch with Camille
instead of coming to me?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.060
You would have said no.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.660
What part of, "I need you to trust me,"
did you not understand?

11:00.770 --> 11:02.900
Is this what it is to
care about someone?

11:02.940 --> 11:05.340
That you're worried
about them all the time?

11:05.380 --> 11:08.480
Because, Cameron,
that just doesn't sound right to me.

11:08.510 --> 11:12.140
I have a history of watching people I care
about get into bad situations or worse.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.570
Well...

11:14.850 --> 11:17.090
- Then maybe we shouldn't be together.
- This isn't was this is about.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.250
No. If I'm causing you
more pain than happiness,

11:19.290 --> 11:21.970
then I don't want
anything to do with this.

11:22.230 --> 11:26.790
You are not the only one who gets to
worry about how the other person is doing.

11:29.700 --> 11:30.700
Fine.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.970
I'll work on not being such
a helicopter boyfriend.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.370
That's the last time you go rogue.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.200
At least, not without me.

11:40.640 --> 11:43.010
Okay. You got it.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.680
I'll be Rogue One and
you can be Rogue Two.

11:46.710 --> 11:49.640
Oh, there will never be a <i>Rogue Two.</i>

11:51.920 --> 11:55.860
Agent Goodkin, I'll tell you the
same thing I told you over the phone.

11:55.890 --> 11:58.760
MI6 has nothing to tell the NSA.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.730
So, none of your people are
in Los Angeles right now?

12:05.070 --> 12:08.640
- I didn't say that.
- A man was murdered at the Windwood Hotel.

12:08.670 --> 12:10.760
We think he's one of yours.

12:11.640 --> 12:15.610
- Do you have a name?
- No. There was no identification on him.

12:15.650 --> 12:20.750
I assure you, Agent Goodkin, there's no
connection between your John Doe and MI6.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.660
He has a Royal Marines tattoo.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.850
And we have reason to believe
he was familiar with spycraft.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.890
If this man was a member
of the Royal Marines,

12:29.930 --> 12:33.020
I honor and respect his memory...

12:33.360 --> 12:36.180
but that still doesn't make him MI6.

12:37.130 --> 12:39.630
What I don't respect is the NSA.

12:39.670 --> 12:42.140
Always barging in where
they're not welcome,

12:42.170 --> 12:45.310
wanting cooperation,
but never offering any in return.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.980
You see, I've dealt with your
organization in the past.

12:48.010 --> 12:49.210
Don't care for it.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.750
And see no reason to do it again.

12:51.780 --> 12:55.560
So, what is it you want, hmm? You want
cooperation? I'm willing to offer it.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.980
Consider it a professional
courtesy. What...

12:58.820 --> 13:00.260
do you want?

13:00.290 --> 13:03.860
What I want,
you don't have the authority to grant.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.430
Try me.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.550
Help me help you.

13:09.300 --> 13:11.600
Why are you quoting Jerry Maguire?

13:11.970 --> 13:13.340
He does that.

13:13.370 --> 13:16.560
So... what do you want?

13:17.470 --> 13:18.910
Cameron: <i>Her name's Chloe Marks.</i>

13:18.940 --> 13:21.810
LAPD picked her up last night
on a drunk and disorderly.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.580
A drunk MI6 agent? Let me guess,
vodka martinis? Shaken, not stirred?

13:26.620 --> 13:29.480
So, any chance Stephanie can pull
some strings at the DA's office?

13:29.520 --> 13:33.000
We get her out, Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass
helps us with our John Doe.

13:33.030 --> 13:34.530
Why doesn't he go through
official channels?

13:34.550 --> 13:36.450
I dunno.
Didn't want to embarrass the agency.

13:36.470 --> 13:37.660
Uh-huh.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.600
All right, let me see what I can do,
but no promises.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.070
Okay.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.410
"Agent Stick-Up-His-Ass," huh? What
happened to "professional courtesy"?

13:44.440 --> 13:47.040
Huh. You should hear what I
really wanted to call him.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.600
Our jobs are to put people in jail,
not get them out.

13:52.650 --> 13:56.150
- Why the sudden interest in Chloe Marks?
- It's a quid pro quo.

13:56.190 --> 13:58.360
If Chloe's the "quid" who's the "quo"?

14:00.200 --> 14:02.180
Classified, I get it.

14:05.150 --> 14:08.220
- She punched a cop.
- She's a foreign national.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.270
Tell that to the cop's busted nose.

14:10.300 --> 14:11.330
Well...

14:13.140 --> 14:15.800
Are you really going to make me do this
without going through the proper channels?

14:15.840 --> 14:19.910
We both know no one can make Stephanie
Fisher do anything she doesn't want to do.

14:21.630 --> 14:23.390
I'll file the paperwork.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.890
Thank you. I owe you.

14:26.620 --> 14:28.270
Dinner?

14:30.280 --> 14:33.390
This favor goes way beyond dinner,
my friend.

14:34.490 --> 14:36.210
I can work with that.

14:47.570 --> 14:48.570
She's so...

14:48.600 --> 14:50.330
- Young.
- Pretty.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.080
Chloe Marks.

14:54.110 --> 14:55.540
Which one of you is my savior?

14:55.580 --> 14:58.510
Ah, it was a team effort.
I'm Agent Goodkin, this is Agent Clark.

14:58.550 --> 15:00.650
We're with the NSA.
Dexter Abbott sent us.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.680
Well, it's about bloody time.

15:03.660 --> 15:04.890
Never mind.

15:04.920 --> 15:08.120
Get me a fluffy robe and all
the little lavender amenities,

15:08.150 --> 15:09.930
- and I'll forgive you both.
- Or...

15:09.960 --> 15:11.990
how about we call you a cab,
you go back to the hotel,

15:12.030 --> 15:13.800
and you can get your own amenities?

15:13.830 --> 15:16.560
Yeah, about that. Tiny problem.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.630
The hotel booted me after my,
I assure you, provoked,

15:19.670 --> 15:21.170
unfortunate conduct in their lounge.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.240
- So where are you staying now?
- It's a moving target.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.840
Well,
we can take you back to Abbott's office.

15:25.870 --> 15:28.750
Please. Not looking like this.

15:29.850 --> 15:31.980
I don't mind the occasional
"walk of shame"...

15:32.010 --> 15:33.360
God knows I've done enough of them...

15:33.390 --> 15:36.490
But this one could be a career ender.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.490
Well, I'm not too far from here, if you
want to come back to my place and clean up.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.390
- You're a love.
- Yeah, car's right over here.

15:45.930 --> 15:48.160
Professional courtesy.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.980
Linus: Nothing here matches
the images in stitch.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.760
Apple tree. Blossoms.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.990
Roots underground. It's for hidden.

16:02.010 --> 16:06.350
Snake and apple. It's like Adam and Eve.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.040
Is it a relationship gone wrong

16:08.060 --> 16:09.930
or a relationship gone right?

16:09.980 --> 16:11.610
You're working too hard.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.340
Pretty much the first time
I've ever been accused of that.

16:14.370 --> 16:16.630
Yeah. I think...

16:16.660 --> 16:21.000
each image is a specific phrase,
words, word, or a word fragment.

16:21.090 --> 16:22.320
It's a language.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.340
That only our John Doe knew.

16:24.370 --> 16:27.170
I should loop Ivy in on this.
She's really good at this sort of thing.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.390
Really? Ivy again?

16:31.550 --> 16:33.050
You'd like her if you got to know her.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.350
I'm sure she's lovely or something.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.990
Look, I know...

16:39.020 --> 16:42.390
things are "not okay,"
to use your words...

16:42.420 --> 16:44.290
Good, you were paying attention.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.360
But we gotta get past this.

16:46.390 --> 16:50.160
Whether you like it or not,
Ivy is important to me.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.440
So, I'm sorry supporting
her before didn't work out.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.630
It bit me in the ass.

16:54.740 --> 16:57.900
But that's not my fault. Or yours.

16:57.940 --> 17:00.780
Can't we please just move on?

17:03.710 --> 17:06.710
Look, I'm seeing Ivy today after work.

17:06.750 --> 17:08.579
Why don't you join us? Drinks?

17:08.619 --> 17:12.119
I, uh... I already have plans tonight.

17:13.150 --> 17:16.310
You have plans? You're seeing someone?

17:17.960 --> 17:19.670
Oh.

17:20.010 --> 17:21.720
Who is he?

17:23.730 --> 17:27.440
All right. Nobody knows, so not a word.

17:29.030 --> 17:32.620
I'm dating the medical examiner
who works with the program.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.760
- Amanda? But she's...
- Uh-huh. Stay woke.

17:38.150 --> 17:41.680
Hey. I'm just surprised, that's all.

17:42.450 --> 17:45.250
Ugh! Fine. Screw drinks.

17:46.180 --> 17:49.280
Bring Ivy to the house
for dinner tonight.

17:49.300 --> 17:51.030
Amanda and I will cook.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.270
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

17:54.300 --> 17:58.070
And listen,
nobody in the lab knows about Amanda.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.880
And it's been pretty perfect,

17:59.900 --> 18:02.440
but it's also new and I don't want
to make this an in-lab meme, so...

18:02.470 --> 18:04.740
Oh, don't... Don't worry. I got it.

18:04.770 --> 18:08.310
Lips are sealed.
That's a language I understand.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.630
Man: Taxi!

18:14.380 --> 18:16.480
Kirsten: So, now what's the game plan?

18:16.820 --> 18:20.150
Well, we held up our end of the bargain,
now MI6 has to hold up theirs.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.970
We'll tell Abbot that
we rescued his agent

18:22.000 --> 18:23.470
and hopefully he can find
out who our John Doe is.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.170
Okay. Well, text me
after you talk to him.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.130
- I figured you'd go.
- And you'd stay here?

18:28.150 --> 18:30.520
- It is my loft.
- You made the deal with Abbott.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.780
Agent Goodkin...

18:32.800 --> 18:35.440
do you happen to have something
I can wear while my clothes dry?

18:35.460 --> 18:36.870
Things got a little messy last night,

18:36.900 --> 18:38.660
so I washed them in your sink.

18:41.140 --> 18:44.810
Uh, Agent Clark can
help you with that. I...

18:45.660 --> 18:47.870
was just leaving.

18:55.610 --> 18:56.980
Abbot: John Harrington.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.190
He was a mid-level agent with us.

19:00.410 --> 19:03.680
Forgive me,
I had no idea how serious this was.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.520
I assume Harrington was here on a case.

19:05.550 --> 19:07.520
No, not recently.

19:07.550 --> 19:08.990
A few months ago, yes.

19:09.020 --> 19:12.290
Well, the NSA's gonna need to see the
file for the case he was working on.

19:12.330 --> 19:13.760
Sorry, it's been scrubbed.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.890
All right,
we need to cooperate with each other.

19:15.930 --> 19:18.490
NSA is hard to cooperate with.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.240
That case Harrington was on,

19:25.270 --> 19:28.340
he brought his wife, Belinda,
with him as part of his cover.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.860
She was unaware it was a business trip.

19:30.890 --> 19:35.060
Then she was abducted, right from the
hotel where she was going to meet John.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.380
Kidnapped?

19:38.250 --> 19:41.560
Ransom demands were made,
payments dead-dropped.

19:41.590 --> 19:44.290
She is presumed dead. Body never found.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.490
Harrington went balls-to-the-wall
to find her killer.

19:46.530 --> 19:49.280
I tried to reason with him,
but he'd have none of it.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.380
Went rogue, came back
here on his own dime.

19:52.410 --> 19:57.750
That's when I brought in Chloe...
uh, Agent Marks, to find him.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.990
How do you know Belinda
isn't still alive?

20:00.030 --> 20:01.920
Because the animal who took her

20:01.940 --> 20:05.320
shot off her index finger
and mailed it to Harrington.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.400
Are you and Agent Goodkin more than
just professional acquaintances?

20:09.430 --> 20:12.430
Agent Marks. I don't believe
that's any of your business.

20:12.470 --> 20:16.170
C'mon, Kirsten. Think of this
as inter-agency cooperation.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.740
Hmm. Are all young,
female MI6 agents like you?

20:20.770 --> 20:23.110
God, I wish. Imagine the fun.

20:23.140 --> 20:25.630
Is that your mission?
To bring fun to MI6?

20:26.910 --> 20:29.220
You don't think much of me, do you?

20:29.250 --> 20:31.580
That's okay, neither did my family.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.650
I had a very privileged upbringing.

20:33.690 --> 20:37.560
What's the old saying? With great
privilege comes stuffy parents.

20:37.590 --> 20:39.870
So when MI6 recruited me, I went for it.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.380
- To rebel?
- To make a difference.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.700
Cameron just texted.

20:46.730 --> 20:49.800
Abbott said the agent's
name was John Harrington

20:49.840 --> 20:52.840
and that you were looking for him
in the days before he was killed.

20:53.410 --> 20:55.540
Well, he was my first assignment.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.290
Cocked that up good.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.150
Please tell me you're close
to finding his killer.

21:05.020 --> 21:07.820
Ugh. It's Abbott. He's summoning me.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.020
Talk of "stuffy."

21:09.060 --> 21:11.360
He and Harrington used to be partners,
did you know that?

21:11.390 --> 21:12.790
Actually, no.

21:12.830 --> 21:15.910
Hmm. It's interesting
Abbott didn't tell you.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.370
- Anyway...
- Well, if you think of anything else,

21:19.400 --> 21:21.700
- please let me know.
- Well, I'm tapped out,

21:21.740 --> 21:23.600
but I'll pick Abbott's
brain when I see him.

21:23.640 --> 21:27.370
And if he accidentally says something
interesting, I'll let you know.

21:31.310 --> 21:35.010
So, Harrington's wife's name is Belinda.
Try this on.

21:35.050 --> 21:40.260
We know that Old High German for
"bright serpent" is <i>Betlinde.</i>

21:40.990 --> 21:43.560
The golden snake is Belinda.

21:43.590 --> 21:46.130
That's... possible.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.710
But that would mean Harrington's
death memory is of him

21:48.730 --> 21:51.330
being attacked by his dead wife, so...

21:52.300 --> 21:53.300
Let's try this.

21:53.330 --> 21:58.300
Harrington "cut"
from MI6 to search for his wife.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.870
- His wife's the swan?
- Swans mate for life.

22:04.310 --> 22:05.680
Okay, new topic.

22:06.780 --> 22:08.710
How long do you think it
would take you to break

22:08.750 --> 22:11.480
a six-digit code on the
credenza in Maggie's office?

22:11.520 --> 22:13.790
Think whatever's inside that
credenza might have something to do

22:13.820 --> 22:15.480
with how our cases get picked.

22:16.290 --> 22:19.030
Maggie put me in charge,
I need to know everything.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.190
Just ask her. She might tell you.

22:22.230 --> 22:23.630
Yeah, but then again, she might not.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.830
Never ask a question you don't
want to hear the answer to.

22:26.530 --> 22:28.330
Hours to weeks.

22:28.370 --> 22:30.270
Long as it gets done
before Maggie gets back.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.540
How goes twisted Pictionary?

22:32.570 --> 22:34.970
- Oh. My brain is fried.
- Yeah, I'm callin' it.

22:35.010 --> 22:36.310
Everyone go home. Get some rest.

22:36.340 --> 22:37.890
We'll pick this up tomorrow, huh?

22:39.680 --> 22:42.310
- I thought we were getting some rest.
- Oh, boss never sleeps.

22:42.350 --> 22:44.820
- Okay, can I help...
- Nah, I'm good.

22:44.850 --> 22:46.090
You didn't let me finish.

22:46.120 --> 22:49.820
Can I help you decide where we're
gonna take-out from tonight?

22:53.450 --> 22:56.780
So, I'm thinking tonight's Kubrick
film should be <i>Barry Lyndon,</i>

22:56.810 --> 22:59.910
an Irish adventurer who
was recruited to be a spy.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.680
Art imitating life?

23:01.700 --> 23:04.740
Hope you don't mind. I let myself in.

23:20.210 --> 23:23.440
It's lovely. Thank you.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.540
Are you okay to talk
about what happened?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.000
Abbott was miffed I lost Harrington...

23:33.020 --> 23:35.620
- and got pinched by the cops.
- Doesn't explain the violence.

23:35.660 --> 23:39.000
Don't let Abbott's bearing fool you.
He's an animal.

23:39.590 --> 23:42.210
Used to brag about
waterboarding detainees.

23:44.010 --> 23:46.240
Well, something must've set him off.

23:46.270 --> 23:48.480
I did ask him about his
relationship with Harrington.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.430
What'd he say?

23:49.460 --> 23:51.050
Nothing.
That's when he went balls-off on me.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.010
You must've hit a nerve.

23:53.050 --> 23:54.770
You think Abbott could've
killed Harrington?

23:54.790 --> 23:56.550
Pushed him off a roof?

23:56.590 --> 23:58.020
No, he's far too clean.

23:58.050 --> 24:01.610
Well, maybe Abbott wanted it to look
like someone-not-as-clean did it.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.320
It's not my problem anymore.
I'm done with MI6.

24:05.350 --> 24:08.740
I mean, I did not sign up for... this.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.720
So I quit.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.520
Have an early morning flight
back to London. Tomorrow.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.590
Then, you'll stay here until then.
It's safer.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.990
You can have Cameron's room.
We'll take the couch.

24:19.730 --> 24:21.270
Both of you?

24:22.120 --> 24:23.490
Together?

24:25.670 --> 24:26.830
Cozy.

24:26.870 --> 24:29.600
Babe, are you sure your
friends are cool with mezcal?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.670
I mean, not everyone's
into the smoky taste.

24:31.710 --> 24:34.010
Camille: Yeah, yeah,
don't worry about Linus.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.670
Ivy might be more of a wild card.

24:38.950 --> 24:41.150
You are so...

24:41.180 --> 24:45.370
Oh, my goddess, I
can't even describe it.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.240
- That's them.
- I'm glad we're doing this.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.000
Oh, hello and welcome.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.510
- Hey, it's great to see you again.
- Mm-hmm.

25:04.140 --> 25:05.910
- Amanda? I'm Ivy.
- Mm-hmm.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.840
And this is a Mezcal Mule.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.540
It's my grandma's recipe.
She drank like a pirate.

25:12.450 --> 25:13.750
We brought wine.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.850
For after, perfect. You guys just chill.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.420
Amanda and I will finish making dinner.

25:17.450 --> 25:18.790
Yeah.

25:22.420 --> 25:25.320
- Shiitake for a green pepper?
- Kirsten: Deal.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.910
I'd offer you beer or wine, but Agent
Marks cleaned me out pretty good.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.970
Hmm. She had a rough day.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.560
Aah. Rough two days.

25:34.890 --> 25:37.140
Oh, it's Maggie.

25:37.700 --> 25:42.580
"All of Harrington's files were scrubbed
except the one he was working on here."

25:42.610 --> 25:46.090
"That wasn't scrubbed,
because it never existed."

25:48.720 --> 25:52.910
- So Abbott lied to us?
- A spy who lies, what are the odds?

25:56.190 --> 26:00.430
It's called a mind palace.

26:00.460 --> 26:03.870
Could the sum of the letters
of cow be the answer?

26:03.900 --> 26:07.040
See, it's not a code, it's a language.

26:08.300 --> 26:12.840
Welcome to "Around Los
Angeles in 80 Bites."

26:12.870 --> 26:15.270
These are my favorite appetizers
from my favorite restaurants.

26:15.310 --> 26:19.280
Just please try my gnocchi before you
decide who's Top Chef in this relationship.

26:19.310 --> 26:22.080
- Ooh, wait. We forgot the crackers.
- Oh, I'll grab 'em.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.970
Uh, Linus,
you wanna be a dear and help Amanda?

26:24.000 --> 26:24.520
Amanda: Oh.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.130
I'm pretty sure I don't need any help.

26:26.150 --> 26:29.390
It's on a high shelf.
You're my pocket bae.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.590
Tall-ish Linus to the rescue.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.260
Okay, listen. Please don't hurt Camille.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.440
Wow. Where did that come from?

26:50.480 --> 26:51.940
From someone who really cares about her.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.650
- You mean, like me?
- I mean me.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.280
What do you mean, "what is my game?"

26:55.300 --> 26:56.900
You heard me, sweetheart,
I don't trust you.

26:56.930 --> 26:59.090
And that's fine, because I don't
really trust a lot of people,

26:59.120 --> 27:00.620
but if you hurt Linus in any way...

27:00.650 --> 27:02.460
What makes you think I would hurt Linus?

27:02.490 --> 27:06.160
Oh, I don't know, let
me think. Genetics?

27:06.190 --> 27:08.430
I'm warning you,
Camille may act tough, but...

27:08.450 --> 27:09.630
Hold up.

27:09.660 --> 27:12.480
Did you just say, "I'm warning you"?

27:13.330 --> 27:16.070
Do you have any idea
what I do for a living?

27:16.100 --> 27:20.240
I know nine different ways to kill you
and make it look like natural causes.

27:20.270 --> 27:23.010
So why don't you get
the frickin' crackers

27:23.040 --> 27:24.810
before I show you number eight?

27:24.850 --> 27:26.910
I'm not my father.

27:26.950 --> 27:29.150
I like Linus for who he is.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.580
- There's no ulterior motives.
- If you're using him

27:31.620 --> 27:33.450
to get inside information
on the program though,

27:33.490 --> 27:36.320
I'd say that qualifies
as an ulterior motive.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.020
Trixy-bits for everyone.

27:38.060 --> 27:40.140
Yummy!

27:43.500 --> 27:45.970
Quincy?
I have to talk to you about something.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.870
Good or bad?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.840
I'm not sure yet.

27:49.870 --> 27:52.510
I got a call from a
friend of mine at the DOJ.

27:52.540 --> 27:53.910
My name has come up in some meetings

27:53.940 --> 27:56.040
and there might be an opening there...

27:56.080 --> 27:58.980
- for me.
- It's what you've always wanted.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.210
- It probably won't happen.
- Hey.

28:01.980 --> 28:05.130
That's what we thought about us.
And now, here we are.

28:05.520 --> 28:07.090
This is great.

28:08.010 --> 28:10.980
Yes. This is.

28:19.050 --> 28:21.090
Mm. Mm.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.550
This is way better than sex.

28:22.590 --> 28:24.620
- Mm.
- Okay, maybe not better than sex.

28:24.650 --> 28:26.570
But these days,
I gotta take what I can get, right?

28:26.590 --> 28:28.190
We need to get everyone to the lab.

28:29.660 --> 28:32.200
- What's up?
- I think Abbott...

28:32.230 --> 28:34.070
is way more involved
than he's letting on.

28:34.100 --> 28:35.660
I'll shoot a text to the team.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.170
Well, what about Chloe?
She shouldn't be alone.

28:37.200 --> 28:39.140
- Well, she'll be fine until the morning.
- No, no, no, no.

28:39.170 --> 28:41.170
If Abbott's involved,
he'll be able to figure out my address.

28:41.210 --> 28:42.430
This loft's in my name.

28:42.460 --> 28:44.440
Oh, my house isn't.
It's in Ed Clark's name.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.380
Okay, wake her up.
Tell her there's a change in venue.

28:46.410 --> 28:47.850
Okay.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.150
She sleeps naked.
You wake her up. I'll text.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.800
- Camille?
- Yeah. Got Cameron's text. Let's go.

29:05.830 --> 29:07.630
Hey, wait. This is Chloe Marks from MI6.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.330
- Charmed, I'm sure.
- Likewise.

29:09.370 --> 29:10.900
Cool if she stays here tonight?

29:10.940 --> 29:12.140
Mmm. I'm...

29:12.170 --> 29:14.570
not sure tonight is the best...

29:14.610 --> 29:15.220
Why not?

29:15.240 --> 29:18.010
Because she's
already got an overnight guest.

29:19.780 --> 29:21.210
Of course she can stay.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.980
Amanda, meet Kirsten and Chloe.

29:25.020 --> 29:27.720
Kirsten you know about.
Chloe is an MI6 agent in grave danger.

29:27.750 --> 29:30.160
Oh, very exciting. I work with the dead.

29:30.190 --> 29:33.090
Oh, then you must know my family.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.330
I like this one.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.060
Why don't you guys run off

29:37.100 --> 29:38.500
and Chloe and I will
swap horror stories.

29:38.530 --> 29:40.430
We won't be long.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.500
- Is there wine?
- Yes, loads.

29:42.540 --> 29:44.370
Take your time.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.700
- We won't be too long. I hope.
- Okay.

29:49.910 --> 29:51.580
- Camille...
- Oh, God, please don't make it a thing.

29:51.610 --> 29:53.650
I was going to say
that I'm happy for you.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.510
Amanda seems great.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.110
Yeah.

30:00.460 --> 30:01.600
Look at this.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.990
- A cow.
- And this?

30:04.010 --> 30:05.280
A cow.

30:06.460 --> 30:09.330
Uh-uh. What is a baby cow, Alex?

30:09.360 --> 30:13.270
Correct. I'll take "Seriously, you ruined
my evening over this" for a thousand.

30:13.300 --> 30:14.950
Well, it's not a baby cow.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.680
It's a miniature breed.
It's called a Dexter cow.

30:18.720 --> 30:20.680
As in Dexter Abbott.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.390
The cow on the mind palace was
standing on a terracotta tile.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.630
Dexter was on the roof of the
hotel which has terracotta tiles.

30:26.660 --> 30:28.980
So either Abbott was there
when Harrington was killed,

30:29.000 --> 30:31.670
knows who killed him,
or killed him himself?

30:31.700 --> 30:33.290
Let's go with option number three.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.850
Just got ballistics. Bullet found on
the roof was typed through Interpol.

30:35.870 --> 30:37.820
It is from Abbott's weapon.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.330
Let Maggie know what we found.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.820
Go to Abbott's apartment, see if
he's there. Proceed with caution.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.610
We'll go to the consulate
and check his office.

30:43.630 --> 30:45.070
Nice work, boss.

30:45.090 --> 30:47.410
Elementary, my dear Fisher.

30:51.690 --> 30:53.570
See. Not here.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.930
Okay. Got it.

31:24.590 --> 31:26.280
Everything okay?

31:26.850 --> 31:28.710
Um...

31:28.750 --> 31:31.770
your boss was attacked in his office.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.990
He was shot.

31:34.590 --> 31:35.690
Dexter?

31:37.520 --> 31:38.990
Oh, my God.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.430
Is he dead?

31:40.460 --> 31:44.400
He lost a lot of blood
and is heavily sedated.

31:44.430 --> 31:47.300
- I should go see him.
- No. Camille says we should stay put,

31:47.320 --> 31:49.900
keep the doors locked, and just
hunker down until she gets back.

31:49.940 --> 31:52.300
Why? Am I in danger?

31:52.340 --> 31:54.440
Look, we're just gonna hunker down,

31:54.470 --> 31:56.410
drink some more vino...

31:56.440 --> 31:58.250
and it'll all be fine.

32:12.410 --> 32:13.970
Hey, boss.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.170
Prepare to kneel before me.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.660
You worked up an oxytocin filter?

32:18.700 --> 32:21.430
Yeah... funny story about that. No.

32:21.470 --> 32:23.370
So why am I kneeling before Zod?

32:23.400 --> 32:25.500
Once we knew that the
cow represented Dexter

32:25.540 --> 32:27.370
and that the tile represented
the roof of the hotel,

32:27.400 --> 32:28.830
I was able to develop a codex.

32:28.860 --> 32:30.910
We now have an interpretation protocol

32:30.930 --> 32:34.040
to help us unravel all of
Harrington's mind palace images.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.580
Very cool.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.480
- You ready, boys?
- Let's find out if Zod is right.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.690
Zod is always right.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.420
All right, thanks to Dr. Ahluwalia

32:43.460 --> 32:46.560
we might have a filter that
unravels Harrington's mind palace.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.760
Lights to 20%, please.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.430
I need a go, no-go for...

32:50.460 --> 32:52.460
I'll, uh... I'll take it from here.

32:53.530 --> 32:55.170
You sure?

32:55.200 --> 32:57.140
Yeah. After me and Kirsten were shot at,

32:57.170 --> 32:58.570
it scared the yip right out of me,

32:58.610 --> 33:01.940
but it also made me realize that I
need to be in control of my own mind

33:01.980 --> 33:03.780
before I let her traipse
around in someone else's,

33:03.810 --> 33:06.180
so... I'm working on that.

33:06.210 --> 33:07.710
I'm good.

33:08.770 --> 33:11.440
The inside of Kirsten's
head is all yours, dude.

33:14.820 --> 33:17.120
All right. Radio station
KCAM, Los Angeles,

33:17.160 --> 33:19.420
we're back on the air and
playing all your favorite hits.

33:19.440 --> 33:21.330
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.
Life-Sci?

33:21.350 --> 33:21.780
Go.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.510
- Sub-Bio?
- Go.

33:23.540 --> 33:25.700
- Engineering?
- That's a go, Big Bopper.

33:25.730 --> 33:28.790
- Excellent reference. Communications?
- Communications are a go.

33:28.810 --> 33:30.150
- Medical?
- Go.

33:30.170 --> 33:33.370
- Com check. One-two, one-two.
- I hear you, Easy Listening.

33:33.430 --> 33:38.990
All right. Induce stitch neurosync
on my mark in three, two, one...

33:39.790 --> 33:41.960
we'll be right back after this...

33:42.360 --> 33:43.860
mark.

33:46.550 --> 33:48.190
Memories are still encrypted.

33:48.210 --> 33:49.550
Just gimme a moment.

33:49.570 --> 33:52.260
Any chance we can mind map more
of this region while we're here?

33:54.380 --> 33:57.710
- Map what you can, as fast as you can.
- Thank you, "teamwork."

33:59.940 --> 34:03.240
- Okay. Codex filter should be kicking in.
- Kirsten?

34:04.470 --> 34:06.220
I see a door.

34:16.940 --> 34:19.500
It's open. It's filled with white.

34:19.530 --> 34:23.199
- More mind palace?
- No. Viable memories are beyond that door.

34:23.230 --> 34:26.070
- Camille, how's the mapping?
- Dense.

34:26.100 --> 34:29.570
It's all white because the memories are
encrypted and the area isn't fully mapped.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.389
Mapping takes time.
Your call. Stay or move on?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.880
Let's move.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.429
- Think of the end game.
- I am. Catching whoever shot Harrington.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.070
I'm going through.

34:55.530 --> 34:57.930
I'm at a wedding, and
it's not encrypted.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.980
Tell Zod, "Nice job."

35:01.100 --> 35:03.640
Father: Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

35:03.670 --> 35:06.510
- Cameron: <i>Do you see Harrington?
- Yup, he's the groom.</i>

35:07.840 --> 35:11.360
It's his wedding to Belinda.
Abbott's here too.

35:12.110 --> 35:15.380
I, John Harrington, take you...

35:16.520 --> 35:19.430
There's apples,
just like in Harrington's memory.

35:24.050 --> 35:27.800
And a family crest. It's
the swan and the sword.

35:29.370 --> 35:31.040
Come to mama.

35:31.060 --> 35:34.840
Okay. Swan and the sword seal's a crest
belonging to the Lindsay Family of Ireland.

35:34.870 --> 35:37.270
Hello. MI6 scrubbed all
of Harrington's records,

35:37.300 --> 35:39.760
but they didn't touch
Irish Marriage records.

35:39.810 --> 35:42.940
Hello and how do you do? Harrington
was married the fourth of March.

35:42.980 --> 35:45.810
- Four marching soldiers.
- Bride was Belinda Lindsay.

35:45.850 --> 35:47.310
A beautiful snake.

35:47.350 --> 35:50.850
I take you,
John Harrington, to be my husband.

35:50.890 --> 35:52.820
Kirsten: Oh, I understand.

35:52.850 --> 35:53.920
Cameron: <i>What?</i>

35:53.950 --> 35:56.560
Kirsten: The snake
coiled around the cow...

35:56.590 --> 35:58.390
Belinda and Abbott
were having an affair,

35:58.430 --> 36:00.030
and Harrington must
have found out about it.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.890
Belinda: Until death do us part.

36:05.230 --> 36:09.130
That means that Belinda was
on the roof with Abbott.

36:09.290 --> 36:11.240
They killed Harrington together.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.290
Pull up what you can on her.

36:14.350 --> 36:18.620
Belinda: Until death...
death... death... death.

36:18.660 --> 36:20.720
She wanted her family ring back.

36:20.750 --> 36:23.800
It was probably stuck.
That's why she shot his finger off.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.400
Okay, we're burning daylight.
Death moment's upon us.

36:26.430 --> 36:28.520
You got eyes on bridezilla?

36:31.610 --> 36:33.650
Oh, my God.

36:35.110 --> 36:36.340
Oh, my God.

36:36.370 --> 36:37.980
- Camille!
- I'm bouncing.

36:39.800 --> 36:43.600
Belinda Lindsay is Chloe Marks,
and she's in my house right now!

36:47.320 --> 36:49.490
Amanda: I'm definitely a Ravenclaw.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.690
- Chloe: Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

36:50.710 --> 36:52.590
Yes.

36:56.930 --> 36:59.740
Oh, hey. I'd have saved you a plate.

37:00.850 --> 37:01.890
Chloe: Is that Camille?

37:01.920 --> 37:03.850
Uh, yeah, just finished work early.

37:03.890 --> 37:05.960
Early? It's almost dawn.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.790
Hey, Camille.

37:08.330 --> 37:10.060
Thanks so much for letting me stay here.

37:10.090 --> 37:11.700
Amanda are I are now good friends.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.800
Oh.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.430
Not too good, I hope.

37:15.470 --> 37:18.230
Is it hot outside? You're sweating.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.040
It's a little... humid.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.800
Um, Amanda, can I talk to
you on the porch real quick?

37:23.450 --> 37:24.580
Hey.

37:25.700 --> 37:28.020
Are you sure Amanda
doesn't want her phone?

37:33.670 --> 37:35.960
Amanda, go.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.870
Hope you're hungry.
We saved you some plates.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.610
I usually do this on dead people.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.550
Yeah? How do I compare?

38:09.590 --> 38:12.860
Umm... sexier than some.

38:12.890 --> 38:14.560
Aah!

38:15.390 --> 38:17.130
Thanks for saving my life.

38:20.430 --> 38:23.020
Man, when Chloe came
at us with that knife,

38:23.040 --> 38:25.700
I dunno, something snapped inside me.

38:27.270 --> 38:29.650
I was just so afraid of losing you.

38:34.310 --> 38:37.960
I don't let people
in. It's not who I am.

38:37.990 --> 38:41.560
It's not who I... raised myself to be.

38:43.810 --> 38:45.630
But I let you in.

38:47.220 --> 38:49.160
It must be scary.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.430
I'm so scared.

38:53.860 --> 38:56.110
But I'm so excited.

38:57.190 --> 38:59.900
My life makes sense with you in it.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.720
Oh, you are pretty pleased
with yourself, aren't you?

39:13.750 --> 39:16.450
And why not? We got the bad guys.

39:16.490 --> 39:20.340
A murderous MI6 agent who
slept naked in my bed...

39:20.370 --> 39:21.940
Don't push it, pal.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.760
And her boss, both of whom are going to
spend the rest of their lives in jail.

39:24.790 --> 39:27.660
Well,
that's inter-agency cooperation.

39:27.680 --> 39:32.140
Heh. Thing is, if she felt so trapped in
her marriage, why not just get a divorce?

39:32.170 --> 39:35.640
'Cause she was all about fun,
and it was way more fun

39:35.670 --> 39:39.210
to seduce Abbott and get
him to help her disappear,

39:39.240 --> 39:43.200
and kill her husband when her
first plan crashed and burned.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.450
- Poor guy.
- Oh, gotta give him credit.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.380
He used the NSA to get her out of jail.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.930
He used us, not the NSA.

39:50.530 --> 39:52.050
"Ee-ther, eye-ther."

39:54.010 --> 39:55.560
Poor Harrington.

39:56.460 --> 40:00.500
All he had to do was forget about
Belinda after she went missing.

40:00.530 --> 40:02.510
Well, he couldn't.

40:03.650 --> 40:05.050
He loved her.

40:07.250 --> 40:10.550
Some part of him knew that
nothing could keep them apart,

40:10.570 --> 40:12.130
not even her death.

40:15.690 --> 40:17.990
Thank you, though,
for saving me in Abbott's office.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.110
You're welcome.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.100
- Cured my, uh...
- Yips.

40:23.380 --> 40:24.410
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

40:27.930 --> 40:29.770
- Oh, so the other day...
- Hmm?

40:29.810 --> 40:31.610
- I'm sitting here...
- With your feet on the desk.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.270
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.630
When I hear this buzzing sound...

40:36.660 --> 40:39.960
- Mm-hmm.
- Coming from inside that cabinet.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.440
And right after that,
I got Harrington's stitch alert.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.770
- Related?
- I think so.

40:46.090 --> 40:50.430
I think there's a device in there that's
connected to how our cases get picked.

40:50.460 --> 40:52.760
- It's a six-digit unlock code.
- Mm-hmm.

40:52.790 --> 40:55.370
Randomized.
And the code changes every 15 minutes.

40:56.370 --> 40:58.730
This will take forever.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.350
Welcome to forever.

41:03.820 --> 41:05.020
Linus.

41:05.050 --> 41:07.580
If we can only find out where
this gets its information from...

41:07.610 --> 41:10.940
Well, then we can figure out where
our cases come from, and we can pick

41:10.960 --> 41:13.530
the ones that will help us the most.

41:13.590 --> 41:15.450
Remember how I said I'd
help you save your mother?

41:15.480 --> 41:16.260
Yes.

41:16.290 --> 41:18.000
I meant it.

41:21.110 --> 41:24.340
Hmm. Promise me that if things
don't work out between us...

41:24.370 --> 41:27.890
Oh, I'll let you keep your fingers.
