00:03.700 --> 00:06.900
- Hannah's a prostitute.
- It's what she does.It's not who she is.

00:06.900 --> 00:10.200
What if she was your girlfriend
fucking other men for money?

00:10.200 --> 00:12.800
- Just stay the night.
- You're in love with her.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.500
I've got a girlfriend, Alex.

# CANSEI DE SER SEXY: Let's Make Love

00:44.700 --> 00:46.600
I need to get Alex back.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.700
So I've decided to go straight.

01:39.000 --> 01:39.600
Hi.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.000
hey

01:43.600 --> 01:45.900
I brought you some of your
favourites.

01:46.300 --> 01:48.500
- Thanks.
- It's those pastries.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.500
- Listen, we should talk.
- Yeah, we should.

01:57.700 --> 01:58.700
I've given up.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.200
- What?
- I've packed in escorting.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.700
I've got a job. Well, a proper one.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.600
- It's this office thing.
- Oh.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.700
I just think it's the only way I can
really make things work with Alex.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.200
Oh, right.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.800
After everything that's happened,
it's...

02:17.800 --> 02:20.100
Is that what you wanted to talk
about?

02:20.400 --> 02:21.400
Yeah.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.600
You're not gonna mention the fact
that we had sex?

02:26.900 --> 02:28.400
Yeah.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.200
OK, that was a mistake.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.300
We shouldn't have done it.
We should just move on.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.000
To what? Pastries?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.600
We had sex, Hannah.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.200
Look, in the heat of the moment, we
forgot the reasons why we shouldn't.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.800
It's not worth talking about.
Let's forget about it.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.200
I'd better get to work.

02:55.800 --> 02:56.900
Ben!

02:57.700 --> 02:59.200
We're cool, aren't we?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.000
Yeah.

03:18.700 --> 03:19.600
Hi.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.600
Thanks for coming round.
I know it's not really...

03:23.600 --> 03:24.800
What do you want?

03:25.800 --> 03:28.200
I wanna show you something.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.500
I've thrown out everything.

03:35.500 --> 03:39.500
All my escort clothes,
my work mobile.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.500
I've packed it in.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.800
And...

03:43.200 --> 03:45.000
I've got a job.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.500
A proper one.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.700
I've done it

03:49.700 --> 03:52.700
because I want us to be together.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.100
Is that it?

03:57.100 --> 03:57.800
What? 

03:57.800 --> 04:00.000
I said, is that it?
Cos if it is, I'm gonna go.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.500
Hang on.
Is that all you're gonna say?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.800
About what?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.100
- How you feel.
- You know how I feel.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.300
- I want you to tell me.
- All right.

04:13.100 --> 04:18.500
I've never felt so humiliated,
disgusted and appalled in my life.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.000
And I've never felt so cheated,
manipulated and...

04:24.000 --> 04:25.600
..and deceived.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.600
And if I'm honest...

04:29.600 --> 04:32.900
I've never...

04:32.900 --> 04:35.600
..hated someone...

04:35.600 --> 04:38.300
..as much as I hated you that day.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.100
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.200
I tell you what, I'll let you try
some. Hold on one sec.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.400
Excuse me,

05:01.400 --> 05:03.900
could you have a look at
my mobile? There's something wrong with it.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.900
- What's wrong with it?
- It hasn't got your number in it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.600
Excuse me.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.700
Try that.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.100
Yeah?

05:28.100 --> 05:29.500
"Can you let me in?"

05:30.600 --> 05:32.100
Yeah, sure.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.500
Can I use your phone, please? I left
mine at home. My car battery's flat.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.700
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.300
Hello? Hi, it's Alex McCloud.

06:08.600 --> 06:12.300
I broke down in the underground car
park on Stephenson Street.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.700
An hour. OK, brilliant.

06:14.700 --> 06:16.800
Thank you. All right, bye.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.700
So they're gonna be an hour and...

06:22.700 --> 06:25.000
Do you wanna wait here? We can keep
an eye out.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.100
No, no. I'll wait in the car.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.400
I'm sorry, I'm not sure it's gonna
work out tonight.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.700
I'm a bit...
My head's a bit messed up.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.600
I'm sort of breaking up with my
girlfriend.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.800
I moved out. It's still a bit messy.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.700
Well, it's OK
if you wanna have a cry.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.400
No, I'm fine.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.700
I just don't feel particularly...

06:55.700 --> 06:58.700
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'd love to.

06:58.700 --> 07:06.100
Look, most guys would kill to be on
a sofa with a girl as pretty...as you.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.600
It would probably do me a world of
good to just...

07:11.200 --> 07:12.800
Yeah.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.300
They just called. They won't be here
till two.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.200
They said they're gonna phone when
they're outside.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.600
Something about women priorities or
something.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.400
It's just not good.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.100
Why don't you come and wait inside?

07:36.100 --> 07:40.300
Alex, come on, I don't wanna wait for
a phone call. I've got work in the
morning.

07:54.300 --> 07:55.400
What?

07:56.400 --> 07:58.700
It's just that...

07:58.700 --> 08:00.300
You've ruined my exit.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.500
No, no, that was brilliant.
Yeah, very good exit.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.900
Well, big day tomorrow.

08:08.900 --> 08:13.400
New job, first impressions.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.200
Yeah.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.300
Are you gonna go to bed or are you
just gonna stand there?

08:19.300 --> 08:21.200
Don't worry, I won't touch you.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.100
Well, not unless you pay me.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.900
That's really inappropriate.
Yeah, I'm going to bed.'Night.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.300
Hannah!

09:12.200 --> 09:15.800
Hannah! Did you hear the phone ring?

09:15.800 --> 09:19.500
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I'm ill on my first day!

09:19.500 --> 09:22.100
Hannah, did you hear the phone ring?
I fell asleep.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.600
I think I've got meningitis. Will you
blanch my skin?

09:24.600 --> 09:27.700
You've not got meningitis.
You're tired.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.700
See, this is why we should be
together.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.600
I always think I'm dying.
You always know I'm tired.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.000
And late.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.800
Late, yeah.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.900
Tired and late.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.400
You know me so well.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.400
No, no, you're really late.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.200
Hello?

09:47.200 --> 09:49.600
- Oh, shit.
- Hello?

09:50.600 --> 09:51.400
Hello?

09:55.700 --> 09:57.300
Hannah.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.000
That's perfect, yeah.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.300
OK.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.500
I'll see you in half an hour.
Thank you.Bye.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.800
So here I am all ready.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.400
Alex, can I say something?

10:15.200 --> 10:16.100
Yeah.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.200
You know we're good together?

10:22.600 --> 10:24.000
Yeah.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.100
If I wasn't an escort, would we still
be together?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.900
Yes.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.900
Well, I'm not an escort.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.300
Any more.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.500
Look, I've got a new job.
I'm on my way.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.400
It's gonna take a lot
more than a new job.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.100
It's a start. It's a start, isn't it?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.500
- It's a start.
- Just... OK, see me tonight.

10:48.500 --> 10:52.000
Even if it's to laugh at my cooking
for one last time.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.800
Hannah.

11:04.500 --> 11:07.900
Did you pull the plug
out of the phone?

11:12.100 --> 11:15.000
Only cos I love you.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.700
My problem with the job market is
that I'm used to thinking on my back,

11:37.700 --> 11:39.700
not my feet.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.200
- Piss a lot?
- Sorry?

11:51.200 --> 11:54.700
Do you piss a lot?

11:54.700 --> 11:58.100
We're allowed two toilet breaks -
one in the morning, one in the
afternoon.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.600
No personal calls, no personal
emails, no chatter.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.500
No crying, no whining.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.400
100 of these, A5, collated and
stapled.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.900
No personal emergencies unless it is
a death or serious maiming.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.200
A sick day is a sick day.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.900
Six sick days not validated by a
medical professional

12:16.900 --> 12:19.700
will result
in an official warning.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.700
200, collated, stapled.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.900
Now, has that all gone in there?

12:24.900 --> 12:27.300
Or am I gonna have to draw a little
diagram?

12:27.300 --> 12:29.400
You can count on me.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.300
I love Alex.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.300
Alex...

13:16.300 --> 13:17.800
I love Alex.

13:19.300 --> 13:22.700
I love...

13:22.700 --> 13:24.600
..Alex.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.800
I love Alex.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.400
He loves me.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.300
I love Alex.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.100
I love Alex.

13:37.100 --> 13:39.400
He loves me.

13:42.400 --> 13:46.200
Alex... I love Alex.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.800
He loves me...

13:48.800 --> 13:51.600
Sorry to interrupt, Hannah. I can
see you've got someone with you.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.000
No...

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
You're not very good at this,
are you?

13:56.000 --> 13:57.200
I thought I was just getting
the hang of it.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.900
No, no, you're not.

13:58.900 --> 14:03.300
So we're gonna have to give you
something a bit easier.

14:03.300 --> 14:07.100
A special task only you can do.

14:11.900 --> 14:14.200
- I've gotta shred all these?
- No, no, no.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.600
- This is just A-C.
- What?

14:16.600 --> 14:19.300
D-Z are in the basement. Here.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.400
Sorry about the big shredder.
It's out of order.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.300
Shred, shred, shred!

14:28.500 --> 14:31.400
I can't do this. I can't do it.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.900
I can't...

14:37.300 --> 14:38.700
I quit.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.800
Another thing she does, right,

14:53.800 --> 14:57.500
in all the years, yeah, it's just
take, take, take.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.100
It is all about her.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.600
She never listens,
impossible to get a word in.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.200
I wanna have a little cheeky one
with you.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.100
Cheers, cheers.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.100
- Ben.
- I'm all right.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.000
You tend your garden, I'll tend
mine. I'm just having a drink.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.100
Hey!

15:19.200 --> 15:20.300
Fine.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.500
No. Thank you.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.800
How was work?

15:33.800 --> 15:36.000
Uneventful. Go on. Take your glass.

15:36.000 --> 15:36.900
No.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.400
I am...

15:41.400 --> 15:44.000
a million miles away from all this
right now.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.600
I thought we were just gonna chat.

15:45.600 --> 15:50.400
Yeah, over dinner. So I thought why
not make a bit of an effort?

15:53.000 --> 15:57.200
When are you gonna admit that
there's 101 things that we need to
sort out before we do this?

15:57.200 --> 16:00.400
- Like what?
- Like promises.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.800
Promises that you're never gonna lie
again, that you'll never see your
old clients.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.600
That you tell me absolutely
everything?

16:06.600 --> 16:09.500
That you're doing this for yourself
and not just for me.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.400
And a promise that you're never,
ever gonna do that again.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.600
I will make every single one of those
promises, and you know I will.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.200
But I'm not gonna let you stand here
and have a go at me

16:19.200 --> 16:20.900
for trying to show you
how much I love you?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.100
And I know this isn't what you want.

16:23.100 --> 16:28.500
But I'm gonna keep on making mistakes
until I do the one thing that makes
you love me again.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.400
It's not working.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.200
- Sorry.
- Give me a minute.

17:14.200 --> 17:18.099
No, don't...don't bother, please...

17:21.500 --> 17:24.599
Hannah, this just...

17:25.400 --> 17:28.600
I can't do this. I can't...

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
God...

17:33.600 --> 17:37.000
Oh, God. Oh, God...

17:37.000 --> 17:39.400
Oh, God.
(POUNDING HEARTBEAT)

17:40.700 --> 17:43.200
Oh, God, no.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.300
What's wrong?

17:45.700 --> 17:49.300
Nothing. Nothing.Just erm...

17:52.800 --> 17:55.400
- Let me try something else.
- Just fucking lie there.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.100
- I'm sorry.
- Don't. Don't.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.200
- I didn't mean that.
- It's fine.

18:18.900 --> 18:22.100
- I don't know why I said that.
- Yeah, you do.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.200
You think I'm a whore.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.200
No, I don't.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.900
Honestly, I don't.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.400
I'm trying.

18:37.400 --> 18:42.000
It's...I can't really get some things out of my head.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.300
This was too soon.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.200
- Hello?
- "I've been mugged."

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
"Are you gonna open the fucking
door?"

19:08.200 --> 19:10.400
Yeah, I'll buzz you up. Hang on.

19:11.400 --> 19:15.200
It's Ben. He's been mugged.
He sounds hammered.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.600
- I've been mugged.
- Yeah, I know. You said.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.900
Come on.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.600
What happened?

19:21.600 --> 19:22.900
Did they take your wallet?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.100
No. I was in town

19:25.100 --> 19:27.800
and then I was with some cans.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.000
And they didn't let me back in.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.800
And I lay down and...The next thing I know,

19:33.800 --> 19:36.200
these girls are putting their bag,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.900
fucking trying to steal my cans.

19:38.900 --> 19:41.700
Some girls stole your lagers?

19:41.700 --> 19:44.500
Some girls stole my lager.

19:44.900 --> 19:47.200
What are you doing here?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.300
I live here.

19:49.300 --> 19:53.400
Oh, you live here.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.700
What did you do that for, Ben?
Whoo!

19:58.700 --> 20:00.800
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, it's fine.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.200
- Can you just give us a minute?
- Yeah, sorry, doctor.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.300
What did you do that for, Ben?

20:08.300 --> 20:12.500
So I don't have to listen to your
boring shit any more.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.200
Me and you are over.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.000
Find someone else to listen to you
moaning.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.200
Him!

20:21.000 --> 20:22.700
What's the matter, Ben?

20:22.700 --> 20:26.700
I broke up with Vanessa.I'm free and single.

20:26.700 --> 20:31.100
And I did a sex on a girl last
night.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.000
Lisa!Very nice.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.500
And I've...

20:37.300 --> 20:40.800
You don't know because you never
talk to me any more.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.800
You're a crap friend.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.800
Sorry.

20:45.700 --> 20:48.100
Why did you break up with Vanessa?

20:48.100 --> 20:49.500
Did you do it over us?

20:49.500 --> 20:52.600
Not everything in the world
is about you.

20:53.200 --> 20:58.600
I broke up Vanessa because...I love her but...

20:58.600 --> 21:00.900
I'm not in love with her.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.700
I love someone else.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.400
Where's my phone? Where's my phone?

21:10.400 --> 21:12.800
You broke it, Breezy.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.800
Hold that for a second.

21:17.500 --> 21:21.200
Are you...
gonna come to bed for a bit?

21:21.200 --> 21:22.300
Just for a little bit.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.900
Just to come to bed...Trousers, yeah?

21:25.900 --> 21:28.800
Er, I think you can keep those on.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.300
- Is he OK?
- Yeah, he's fine.

21:32.300 --> 21:35.000
What's he doing here?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.300
Why is he so drunk?

21:38.700 --> 21:42.300
Because I've been a really crap
friend.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.100
Come to bed.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.800
I'm just gonna stay with him
for a while.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.600
OK.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.800
I thought it was Belle complicating
things.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.500
It turns out it was me all along.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.300
- I'm here to make your day.
- One last job?

22:06.300 --> 22:08.200
- I love you.
- Don't work too hard.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.800
One hour, £5000.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.300
It's not like anyone will know.

22:12.300 --> 22:16.000
She is taking a booking.
9:30 tonight.
