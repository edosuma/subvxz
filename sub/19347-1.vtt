- Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's
fine, but I think he...

03:38.152 --> 03:39.551

03:39.553 --> 03:41.186

03:41.988 --> 03:44.022
- Jesse, how much longer?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.424
- A couple miles,
we're almost there.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.934

- Oh, come on, don't
be so tense, woman,

04:01.408 --> 04:03.342
I'm just trying to make
it a little less awkward.

04:03.344 --> 04:04.910
- No one finds it awkward.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.044
- Okay, fine.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.614
- Sorry.

04:08.616 --> 04:12.951
- Don't be sorry, em, it's
okay, we're almost there.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.576
- I'll be right back.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.413

04:43.983 --> 04:46.518
- Can you please help
me out with Zach?

04:46.520 --> 04:50.622

05:20.621 --> 05:21.621
- Hello?

05:25.958 --> 05:26.958
Hello?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.040

i just take cash.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.867
- Okay, you got an atm?

07:15.869 --> 07:19.771
- Sure, right in the back
next to the teleport.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.474
- Yeah, come in.

07:24.544 --> 07:28.313
- Hi, could we use
your bathroom, please?

07:28.315 --> 07:30.115

07:54.107 --> 07:55.740
Why do you wanna come here?

07:55.742 --> 07:56.942
- It's a good question.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.777
Listen, I just came
here to help my friends

07:58.779 --> 08:00.745
fix their house,
but we gotta go,

08:00.747 --> 08:04.683
so, yeah, if I could buy some
gas and beer, that be great.

08:04.685 --> 08:05.685
- Oh, beer?

08:06.419 --> 08:07.419
Yeah.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.890
I got just what
the doctor ordered.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.392
This is the best
homebrew in the state.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.961
Billy's beer, boy.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.875
- Hey, Jess, check it out.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.812
So, this is apparently the
best beer in the state.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.145
- Oh, sweet.

08:35.148 --> 08:36.648
- And more great news,

08:36.650 --> 08:38.082
weird guy in there does
this home delivery service

08:38.085 --> 08:39.618
of his beer every Saturday,

08:39.620 --> 08:42.687
today is Friday,
guess who signed up?

08:42.688 --> 08:43.522
- You did.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.689
- I did.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.757
- Cool, man.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.126
- All right, what's up?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.461
- What?

08:49.463 --> 08:51.763
- Come on, how is she?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.431
- What, she's good.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.700
- And you?

08:55.702 --> 08:56.935
- I'm good.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.471
Yeah, you know, ever
since we got Zach,

08:59.473 --> 09:03.542
I'm watching a hell of a
lot more Internet porn.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.113
No, she just has no idea
how to take care of him,

09:08.115 --> 09:11.683
you know, so she really
hasn't been herself lately.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.952
- I can't even imagine
what that must feel like.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.454
- Yeah, it must
be awful waking up

09:16.456 --> 09:20.392
in the middle of the night just
to check if he's all right.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.893
- Yeah, there's that,

09:21.895 --> 09:24.396
but I was talking about
not having sex for months.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.297
- Fuck you, asshole.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.032
- Oh, what, come on.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.703
- No, it's all gonna
be over soon, so.

09:33.372 --> 09:36.708
- How is she with the
whole institution thing?

09:36.710 --> 09:39.611
- You know, she's
good, we're good.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.314
By the way, guys, thanks for
coming all the way out here

09:42.316 --> 09:44.449
and helping us move in,
we really appreciate it.

09:44.451 --> 09:47.953
- Yeah, of course, man,
look, we got some fresh air,

09:47.955 --> 09:51.990
we got some cold beer, we got
the birds squawking and shit,

09:51.992 --> 09:56.227
you know, I feel like we're
gonna like this place.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.931
- Welcome, welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

10:32.933 --> 10:34.399

that's yours, well, from now on.

10:43.175 --> 10:45.877
- Okay, that's what I call
some small town hospitality.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.647
- Yeah, now is it safe to
say that you are in charge?

10:48.649 --> 10:51.349
- Oh, no, no, no, I can
barely take care of myself,

10:51.351 --> 10:52.584
it's this lady right here.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.551
- Hi.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.054

10:56.056 --> 10:56.955
Good to meet you.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.189
- Nice to meet you, too.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.724
- Yeah, now just a
few little formalities

10:59.726 --> 11:01.359
we have to go over here
before I give you the key

11:01.361 --> 11:03.428
to this stunning palace.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.165
Now, just need an
autograph right there.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.133
- Okay.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.841
Okay, now one more
signature there,

11:16.843 --> 11:18.376

11:18.378 --> 11:20.679

been given the key

11:20.681 --> 11:23.181

11:23.183 --> 11:24.382
Guys, guys.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.223
And you know what, oh,

11:32.225 --> 11:34.959
to congratulate you folks
on this marvelous house.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.728
Okay, and I'm not gonna
hold you any longer.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.930
It has been a real
treat, it really has.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.799
It's funny 'cause normally, i
take like one Adderall a day,

11:40.801 --> 11:41.633
I took two today.

11:41.635 --> 11:43.134
- Wow.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.070
- I just, I'm so excited
for you kids, it's great.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.304
- Just take care, bro.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.839
- Yeah, oh, oh, and
guys, before I forget,

11:47.841 --> 11:51.009
the previous owner left in a
hurry for personal reasons,

11:51.011 --> 11:51.943
I don't know, I don't care.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.178
I don't ask those questions,

11:53.180 --> 11:54.479
but I just gotta
put it out there,

11:54.481 --> 11:55.980
when the key was handed to us,

11:55.982 --> 11:58.216
we didn't really have a budge
to hire a cleaning company,

11:58.218 --> 12:01.086
so it's just pretty much left
as is which is even better

12:01.088 --> 12:03.054
'cause you might find something
nice and valuable in there,

12:03.056 --> 12:06.725
you never know, you never
know guys, this is awesome.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.959
You guys enjoy, guys, okay?

12:07.961 --> 12:09.394
- See ya.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.296
- Wow, he's something.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.332
- It's beautiful.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.600
- Yeah, it is.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.236
Yeah, everything's
gonna be great.

12:34.186 --> 12:35.754
There you go, bud.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.897
- Can someone check
the circuit breaker?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.465
- Yeah, I'm on it.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.101
- Wait, there's
someone over there.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.170
- What the fuck is that?

12:56.475 --> 12:58.877
- Oh my god, it's so freaky.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.082
- Hey, I love this stuff.

13:06.986 --> 13:10.922
- Stop acting like a kid,
can you go hide that thing?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.757
- Let there be light.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.994
Oh, wow, it's
actually not that bad.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.329
- Not that bad, dude,
this is freaking awesome.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.532
- You go get rid of that thing,

13:20.534 --> 13:23.001
I'm gonna pick us a room out.

13:25.971 --> 13:26.971
- Okay.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.009
It's time to go,
i know, come on.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.345
It's just that she's a
little hormonal at the moment

13:34.347 --> 13:36.147
and I think it's gonna be best

13:36.149 --> 13:39.818
if you two just don't spend
too much time together, okay?

13:39.820 --> 13:42.053
Come on, why the sad face?

13:49.795 --> 13:50.795
Okay.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.232
You gonna like it down here.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.407
You're not gonna needle these.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.027
Fuck you, bubbles.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.814
- Oh, wow.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.417
Zach, it's your new room.

14:47.586 --> 14:48.853
- Check it out, bud.

14:48.855 --> 14:49.855
- So cool.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.163
- Let's see here.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.000
- What is this?

15:11.143 --> 15:12.143
Oh my god.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.579
She had a heart defect.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.147
- Who you talking about?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.149
- The little girl who
must've lived here.

15:19.853 --> 15:23.021
- Hey, is everything
okay with you, bud?

15:23.023 --> 15:25.957
- Oh, he's okay, i
think he's just tired.

15:25.959 --> 15:26.791
- Okay.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.626
- Let's put him to bed.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.561
- Hey, baby, check it out.

15:30.563 --> 15:34.299
I'm gonna knit us the
finest everlasting condom.

- Oh, Jesus, shut
up, come to momma.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.705
- Oh, that's what's happening.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.340
- I so want you right now.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.409
- Okay, oh, yeah, I see.

15:45.577 --> 15:46.611
- You want this right?

15:46.613 --> 15:47.412
- Yeah.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.579
- Yeah, okay.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.050
Of course, you want this.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.119
You know you're not the
only one who wants this.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.054
- I want it.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.188
- You're the only who gets it.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.190
- Oh, good.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.113
- Are you sure
it's okay to do it?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.115
- What?

16:23.882 --> 16:25.516
Of course, we need to do it.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.719
- No, it's just, I don't
wanna damage anything.

16:27.721 --> 16:29.420
- Don't worry, it's too small.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.022
- Yeah, I know it's only small,

16:31.024 --> 16:33.091
but what if it...

16:33.093 --> 16:35.893
You know, what if it
feels me when I'm...

16:35.895 --> 16:38.663
- I wasn't talking
about the baby.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.833
- Oh, I see, you were
talking about my...

16:41.835 --> 16:43.501
That's funny, you need
to watch your mouth.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.170
- You need to watch your mouth.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.444
- One, two, three.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.883
There you go, can you move that?

17:01.053 --> 17:02.787
There you go, buddy.

17:07.659 --> 17:10.228
- Oh my god, they're so dirty.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.898
- You know, I wanna be
a little dirty, too.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.467
- I know, Jesse, I'm sorry,

17:16.469 --> 17:17.702
it's just really
not a good time,

17:17.704 --> 17:19.503
I need to give him
his medication.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.905
- Yeah, it's never been
a good fucking time

17:20.906 --> 17:21.739
since we got Zach.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.940
- Jesse.

17:22.942 --> 17:25.276
- What, look at him,
he doesn't mind,

17:25.278 --> 17:27.811
he doesn't fucking mind at all.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.481
- He might not make it
through another seizure, okay?

17:30.483 --> 17:31.716
I don't know why you
think a little sex

17:31.718 --> 17:35.153
is more important than
my brother's health.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.754
You don't need to be here.

17:36.756 --> 17:40.558
- We bought the fucking
house because of him.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.096
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

17:46.298 --> 17:49.600
Fuck, it's just, it's
been a long time.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.938
- I know, I'm just not sure
I'm doing the right thing.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.174
- Hey, of course, you are.

17:57.609 --> 18:00.311
Okay, let's just
stick to the plan.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.947
We'll go see the
doctor on Monday

18:02.949 --> 18:05.850
and he'll show us that he'll
take much better care of him

18:05.852 --> 18:07.118
than we ever could.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.619
- I know, but he's
my responsibility

18:08.621 --> 18:10.855
and he's my brother,
he's my only family.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.657
- I know that, I know,

18:12.659 --> 18:14.092
and that's why we
bought this house,

18:14.094 --> 18:15.593
so we can be close to him

18:15.595 --> 18:18.329
and still get on with our lives.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.634
Oh, fuck!

18:25.304 --> 18:27.839
Come on, you dirty, dirty dogs.

18:27.841 --> 18:29.907
- It is time for a toast

18:31.243 --> 18:32.477
to this house,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.115
to old Billy,

18:37.117 --> 18:39.250
and to you guys, my friends.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.985
- Aww!

18:40.987 --> 18:41.819
- Cheers.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.821
- Cheers.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.423
- Come on, em, chill
out a little bit.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.626
- I have to give Zach his
medication, I really can't.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.094
I'm sorry.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.630
- Em, he's right, you know,
you need to relax a little bit.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.931
- Yeah, drink with us.

18:53.933 --> 18:54.765
- Come on.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.600
- Come on.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.834
- Do it.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.803
- All right, just
a little party.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.471
- Yeah, that's the spirit.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.873
- I always wanted to ask you,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.308
you know, how in high school,

19:37.310 --> 19:40.745
girls always have a
crush on the hot teacher,

19:40.747 --> 19:44.315
did you ever have any
students hit on you?

19:46.518 --> 19:49.887
- No, no, no, no, no,
they were always too busy

19:49.889 --> 19:52.490
with cool guys from their
class like that dude.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.125
- Ah, yeah.

19:54.127 --> 19:58.362
- I think you were the
biggest bully in high school.

20:00.332 --> 20:03.167
- Fuck high school,
let's just drink.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.468
- Cheers.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.881
- I feel really good right now.

20:16.883 --> 20:17.715
- Really?

20:17.717 --> 20:18.883
- This is hot.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.817
- Yeah, shit.

20:19.819 --> 20:20.551
- It is, look at these two.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.586
- Oh my god.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.554
- Well, speaking of being hot,

20:23.556 --> 20:25.156
you gonna keep that
fire going or what?

20:25.158 --> 20:28.826
Well, they don't call me
Woody for nothing, I got it.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.494
There you go, baby.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.299
We're out.

20:37.469 --> 20:38.869
We can use that.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.309
What the fuck is this?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.564
- Duer, buer, what's that?

21:10.302 --> 21:13.871
- It looks like some
kind of religious symbol.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.616
- We can heal.

21:27.886 --> 21:29.620
- What religion, though?

21:29.622 --> 21:31.989
- It's hard to say, I mean,
we don't know who lived here

21:31.991 --> 21:33.524
or what they believed in.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.896
- I believe in this.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.303
- We can save you.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.907
You are Zach, you're
body is useless.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.479
We will.

21:57.215 --> 21:58.783
No need to resist.

22:12.931 --> 22:14.465
- Oh, shit.

22:14.467 --> 22:18.035
Hey, guys, we have another
symbol on this board, and...

22:18.037 --> 22:19.037
It says

22:20.305 --> 22:21.305
sabnock.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.775
- Okay, Wikipedia says
that buer is a spirit

22:24.777 --> 22:28.212
that appears in the
16th century book goetia

22:28.214 --> 22:32.116
where he is described as
the great president of hell.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.617
- Oh.

22:33.619 --> 22:37.555
- And that he's capable
of healing all infirmities

22:38.690 --> 22:42.727
and then there's a list
of 72 different demons.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.962
Yeah, what d'you say
the other name was?

22:44.964 --> 22:45.964
- Sabnock.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.700
And this one, this
one says gamory on it.

22:49.702 --> 22:53.237
- Sabnock and gamory, yeah,
they're all listed here.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.640
- All of this is
freaking me out.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.542
- Guys, it's bullshit.

22:59.511 --> 23:02.613
I can heal all
infirmities, with this.

23:04.649 --> 23:07.985
- Man, we got a lot of
stuff to do tomorrow.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.087
- We need to get rid of
all the creepy stuff.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.624
- We'll do it, first thing
in the morning, okay?

23:13.626 --> 23:16.994
- Oh my god, Zach's medication.

23:31.877 --> 23:32.877
- Zach?

23:39.718 --> 23:40.718
Hey, Zach.

23:51.163 --> 23:54.165
Remember that prayer
mom taught us?

23:57.736 --> 24:00.738
Now I lay me down to sleep,

24:00.740 --> 24:03.474
I pray the lord my soul to keep,

24:05.544 --> 24:07.812
if I should die before I wake,

24:07.814 --> 24:10.548
I pray the lord my soul to take.

24:22.627 --> 24:24.762
I just wish mom was here.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.386
- How is he?

24:49.388 --> 24:50.621
- He's really calm.

24:50.623 --> 24:51.455
- Yeah?

24:51.457 --> 24:52.289
- Yeah.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.123
- Well, that's good.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.125
- Yeah.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.396
- You know what else?

24:59.398 --> 25:01.198
Maybe some fresh air.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.872
Maybe he'll actually get better.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.673
- Jesse, he's not gonna better.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.776
- Oh, I don't
know, you know why?

25:12.778 --> 25:13.778
- Why?

25:15.013 --> 25:17.481
- Love makes miracles happen.

25:19.117 --> 25:19.917
Seriously.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.418
- That's so cheesy.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.187
- Oh, yeah, you know what
else makes miracles happen?

25:23.189 --> 25:24.021
- What?

25:24.023 --> 25:25.189
- Making love.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.056
- Oh, yeah?

25:26.058 --> 25:27.058
- Yeah.

25:58.190 --> 25:59.623
- Fuck, fuck you, woodrow,

25:59.625 --> 26:02.259
fuck, I'll kick
your fucking ass.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.661
Baby, baby, don't
worry about it,

26:03.663 --> 26:05.296
no, no, no, it's just woodrow
being asshole, please?

26:05.298 --> 26:08.699
- Okay, no, I'm sorry,
goodnight, Jesse.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.409
- Goodnight, baby.

26:28.320 --> 26:31.288
- You were right about Zach.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.290
- What?

26:34.059 --> 26:37.628
- I need to take a lot
better care of him.

26:55.981 --> 26:56.981
Jesse?

27:01.720 --> 27:02.720
Jesse.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.255
Jesse, wake up.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.731
Jesse!

28:21.399 --> 28:22.399
Jesse!

28:24.870 --> 28:26.670
- Oh, oh my god.

28:26.672 --> 28:30.040
- You're okay, baby,
you're okay, you're okay.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.042
- Zach?

28:42.454 --> 28:43.954
- I'll be damned.

28:45.023 --> 28:46.356
Hey, buddy, how
are you doing this?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.392
Hey, hey, come on,
let's sit down.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.727
Let's sit down.

28:51.196 --> 28:52.629
- Fuck me.

28:52.631 --> 28:55.966
- Emily, Emily, what
the fuck do we do?

28:58.336 --> 28:59.336
Emily?

29:00.371 --> 29:01.271
- What's going on?

29:01.273 --> 29:02.506
- Go with her.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.276
- Em, what happened?

29:07.779 --> 29:08.779
- He...

29:13.518 --> 29:14.518
He walked.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.827
- He's freaking me out.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.031
- Oh, that's the doctor.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.568
Hey, how's it going?

29:31.570 --> 29:32.402
- Good.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.505
- Nice to meet you.

29:34.507 --> 29:38.609
- Hi, Dr. waisenberg, I'm
Emily, very nice to meet you.

29:38.611 --> 29:40.210
Sorry we had to
bother you today.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.112
- No, this is no bother.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.447
- This is Zach.

29:44.816 --> 29:47.851
- I'm sorry I didn't get a
chance to pull Zach's file.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.353
If I remember correctly,

29:49.355 --> 29:52.790
he's suffering from spastic
quadriplegia, am I right?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.424
- Yes.

29:54.426 --> 29:58.228
- And you said that he
stood up this morning.

30:01.533 --> 30:02.833
- Yeah.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.104
- Let's have a
look at you, Zach.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.944
Did you notice anything
unusual about his behavior

30:13.946 --> 30:17.514
over the last day or
two, anything at all?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.284
- He slept really
calmly last night,

30:20.286 --> 30:22.686
but I forgot to give
him his medicine,

30:22.688 --> 30:24.922
so I don't know if that...

30:26.524 --> 30:27.724
- You forgot to give medication

30:27.726 --> 30:29.693
to a patient with
spastic quadriplegia?

30:29.695 --> 30:32.996
- Doc, come on, give
her a break, okay?

30:36.868 --> 30:37.868
- Zach.

30:39.337 --> 30:43.006
My name is Dr. waisenberg,
can you hear me?

30:44.409 --> 30:48.078
I'm just going to listen
to your heartbeat.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.152
There we go.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.494
- Is everything okay?

31:07.165 --> 31:08.465
- Did you hear that?

31:08.467 --> 31:09.533
- Hear what?

31:29.988 --> 31:33.290
- I've never seen
anything like this before.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.994
- Well, what do we do about it?

31:36.996 --> 31:38.228
- I'm gonna ask your permission

31:38.230 --> 31:39.897
to take Zach with me
to the institution

31:39.899 --> 31:41.498
and run a few test right now.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.432
- Okay, I'll come with you.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.334
- No, no, you can stay here,

31:44.336 --> 31:46.169
you might just get in the way.

31:46.171 --> 31:48.572
We'll keep our Monday
appointment as we discussed

31:48.574 --> 31:50.107
and I promise I'll
keep you updated

31:50.109 --> 31:52.075
and you can contact me anytime.

31:52.077 --> 31:52.910
- No.

31:52.912 --> 31:53.744
- Emily.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.912
- What?

31:54.914 --> 31:56.146
- Emily, come on, we've
talked about this.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.581
We don't need to get
in the way, okay?

31:57.583 --> 31:59.883
They're gonna take better
care of him, right?

31:59.885 --> 32:01.184
- That's right.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.454
We should get going.

32:11.663 --> 32:14.031
- Everything's gonna
be all right, okay?

32:14.033 --> 32:15.632
We're gonna go see him soon.

32:15.634 --> 32:16.466
- Okay.

32:16.468 --> 32:17.468
- Okay?

32:19.137 --> 32:21.371
- Yeah, let's get to work.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.157
Last one, man.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.359
Looks good, bro.

32:42.361 --> 32:46.296
- Yeah, at least I'll be
getting me some of this.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.165
Hey, so where are the girls?

32:48.167 --> 32:49.399
- What are you talking about?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.501
They're doing what
they were made for.

32:51.503 --> 32:54.071
- I wasn't made for this.

33:00.678 --> 33:02.546
Em, it's gonna be okay.

33:02.548 --> 33:03.747
- I know, I'm sorry,

33:03.749 --> 33:06.817
I just have a really
bad feeling about this.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.086
I just don't know if I'm
doing the right thing.

33:09.088 --> 33:11.121
- I thought you hated
taking care of Zach.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.957
- I don't hate
taking care of Zach,

33:13.959 --> 33:16.426
I'm not very good at it.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.795
I just feel like
Jesse's been talking me

33:18.797 --> 33:20.597
into doing this stuff
i don't wanna do.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.832
- What are you talking about?

33:21.834 --> 33:24.868
Jesse's here for you,
he quit his job for you.

33:24.870 --> 33:27.471
- Michelle, Jesse didn't
quit his job for me.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.473
- What do you mean?

33:29.475 --> 33:31.975
- He's taking an extended leave.

33:31.977 --> 33:32.977
- What?

33:33.945 --> 33:36.046
- One of his students,

33:36.048 --> 33:38.315
her boyfriend taught
she was cheating on him

33:38.317 --> 33:39.583
with someone from class,

33:39.585 --> 33:42.519
and he brought a gun to school.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.621
- And he shot her?

33:44.623 --> 33:46.890
- And then himself.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.725
- How did I never
hear about this?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.795
- It's a private school,
they shut down the media.

33:51.797 --> 33:52.863
- Oh my god.

33:53.965 --> 33:57.234
- He doesn't like to
talk about, so don't.

33:58.736 --> 34:01.271
- Okay, enough of the bad news,

34:01.273 --> 34:02.706
why don't I finish up here?

34:02.708 --> 34:05.442
- Yeah, I'll just go
start on the basement.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.444
- Yeah.

34:07.812 --> 34:10.714
- What do you think
about all that?

34:10.716 --> 34:11.716
About Zach.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.387
- I don't know, man.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.456
I mean, I guess it's
a good thing, right?

34:20.458 --> 34:21.291
- Right yeah.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.293
- Yeah.

34:28.065 --> 34:30.199
- You know I never
talked about this,

34:30.202 --> 34:32.268
what happened to Emily's mom?

34:32.271 --> 34:36.005
- Well, we think that she
fell asleep behind the wheel,

34:36.007 --> 34:38.375
hit the center
divider with her car.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.842
- And Zach was in the car?

34:39.844 --> 34:40.976
- Yeah, yeah.

34:41.846 --> 34:44.014
- How did he even survive?

34:44.016 --> 34:46.149
- Well, when she
crashed, the car lit up,

34:46.150 --> 34:48.985
this couple pulled over
in time to get Zach out,

34:48.987 --> 34:52.389
but they didn't
make it to his mom.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.491
The shitty thing is I think Zach

34:54.493 --> 34:56.025
saw everything that
happened to her.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.494
- Oh.

34:57.496 --> 34:58.728
That's fucked.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.264
I guess it's a good thing

35:01.266 --> 35:04.067
that he doesn't understand
anything, you know?

35:04.069 --> 35:05.135
- What are you talking about?

35:05.137 --> 35:07.871
He has cp, he's not a vegetable.

35:09.207 --> 35:12.943
Dude, you know nothing about
cerebral palsy, do you?

35:12.945 --> 35:13.945
- No.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.549
- All right, he understands
everything he sees and hears,

35:19.551 --> 35:21.351
he just can't respond,

35:21.353 --> 35:24.855
like his brain can't
control his muscles.

36:36.762 --> 36:39.596
- God, you scared
the shit out of me.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.598
- Sorry.

36:43.067 --> 36:45.902
Wow, look at all
this creepy stuff.

36:45.904 --> 36:49.139
I wonder what kinda
freaks lived here.

36:50.107 --> 36:51.341
- Don't open that.

36:51.343 --> 36:52.343
- Why not?

36:53.311 --> 36:55.879
- I don't know, it's not ours.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.014
- I wonder how much
more weird stuff

36:58.016 --> 37:00.650
we're gonna find in this place.

37:03.020 --> 37:04.087
What's that?

37:15.266 --> 37:16.099
Fuck.

37:16.101 --> 37:16.933
- Me.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.969
- There you go.

37:18.971 --> 37:20.804
- Oh my god, I feel
like such a dick.

37:20.806 --> 37:24.140
- Oh, that would be
a first, wouldn't it?

37:24.142 --> 37:27.944
- Hey, there's something
you guys should see.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.649
- Look, this is extraordinary,

37:32.651 --> 37:35.552
I've never seen
anything like it before.

37:35.554 --> 37:38.855
This boy is going to
change everything.

37:46.597 --> 37:47.764
- What the...

37:59.810 --> 38:01.378
- I wanna go home.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.247
- Baby, don't
freak out about it,

38:04.249 --> 38:08.051
it's just some kids
playing Harry Potter.

38:08.053 --> 38:12.088
- No, no, these are too
detailed for just some kids,

38:12.090 --> 38:15.292
whosever doing this knew
what they were doing.

38:15.294 --> 38:19.262
- Well, what about the
lady who used to live here?

38:19.264 --> 38:20.597
- I don't know.

38:21.465 --> 38:22.465
I think...

38:24.835 --> 38:27.237
I think she was obsessed
with demonology.

38:27.239 --> 38:28.705
- Demono,

38:28.707 --> 38:30.307
is that a real word?

38:30.309 --> 38:31.141
Did...

38:31.143 --> 38:32.375
- shut up, man.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.877
What are you talking
about, Emily?

38:33.879 --> 38:36.479
- I mean, look around the house,

38:36.481 --> 38:38.782
look at all these
signs that we found

38:38.784 --> 38:39.784
and then...

38:40.785 --> 38:42.886
I found this book downstairs

38:42.888 --> 38:45.288
that kinda looked
like a spell book.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.222
- Wait.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.090
- Are you fucking kidding me?

38:47.092 --> 38:47.924
- A spell book?

38:47.926 --> 38:48.758
- Yeah.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.427
- For what?

38:50.429 --> 38:53.129
- I don't know, she
had a sick daughter,

38:53.131 --> 38:56.132
maybe she thought it
could help with that.

38:56.134 --> 38:59.469
- Okay, well, do we know
what happened to them?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.104
Why did they leave?

39:02.173 --> 39:04.774
- Maybe the doctor,
maybe he knows.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.576
- Yeah, you know what,
that's a good idea.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.078
I'll give him a call.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.847
- It's okay, I'll call him,
i wanna check on Zach anyway.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.042
There's still no answer.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.310
What if something
happened to them?

39:40.312 --> 39:43.546
- Emily, you gotta
relax, he's fine.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.982
Okay, the doctor's probably
just a responsible driver

39:45.984 --> 39:49.352
and doesn't wanna
pick up the phone.

39:49.354 --> 39:52.188
- I don't get it, your brother
is finally getting better

39:52.190 --> 39:54.591
and all you do is
complain about it.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.126
- Wow, Michelle,
you don't get it?

39:56.128 --> 39:57.594
- Yeah.
- That's weird

39:57.596 --> 39:58.995
because you've never taken
care of anyone, but yourself.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.130
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, really?

40:00.132 --> 40:01.398
- Come on, girls, stop.

40:01.400 --> 40:04.567
- Jesse, I wanna go
see Zach, please.

40:06.103 --> 40:08.171
- There's no need to go.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.514
- Oh my god.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.315
What happened?

40:19.317 --> 40:20.884
Are you all right?

40:22.019 --> 40:23.253
There's blood on his shirt.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.854
- Shit, hey, let's
get you inside.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.524
- Come on, Zach,
well clean you up.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.526
- Hey

40:30.995 --> 40:32.896
- they're almost here.

40:40.404 --> 40:42.872
- What's wrong with his eyes?

40:43.707 --> 40:45.041
- I don't know.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.446
Michelle, can you
get him some water?

40:49.448 --> 40:50.448
- Yeah.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.252
- Zach, you said
someone was coming,

40:56.254 --> 40:57.821
who were you talking about?

40:57.823 --> 40:59.355
- What, wait a minute, did
you say he said something?

40:59.357 --> 41:02.091
- He said that
somebody was coming.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.827
I don't know what...

41:06.298 --> 41:07.797
- Hey, hey.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.866
- What is it?

41:16.540 --> 41:17.540
- It moves.

41:18.976 --> 41:19.976
So little.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.914
Smaller than the
first one you killed.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.416
- Shut up.

41:26.418 --> 41:28.151
- Hey, you stay away from
her, you fucking freak.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.153
- Zach?

41:31.222 --> 41:33.089
What are you talking about?

41:33.091 --> 41:34.891
- I'm so sorry.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.993
- Hey, you need to
call the doctor again.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.496
- Em, my phone's dead,
where'd you put yours?

41:39.498 --> 41:42.232
- I don't know, it's over there.

41:52.576 --> 41:55.245
- Guys, it goes
straight to voicemail.

41:55.247 --> 41:57.413
- Man, there is some
really weird shit

41:57.415 --> 42:00.984
going on with this guy and we
need to do something about it.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.219
Hello, what are you doing?

42:06.757 --> 42:10.827
- There's somebody out
there, look in the woods.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.696
- They're here.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.665
- Zach, who's here?

42:15.667 --> 42:16.799
- Who's that?

42:20.337 --> 42:21.671
- There's more.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.676
- Is this a joke?

42:26.678 --> 42:29.078
I'm calling the cops.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.513
- Jesse, I'm scared.

42:30.515 --> 42:34.350
- Don't worry, honey,
everything's gonna be fine.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.137
- Let's play.

43:29.139 --> 43:30.540
Don't be afraid.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.843
You can trust us.

43:35.079 --> 43:36.312
Get rid of it.

43:40.684 --> 43:41.684
Kill it

43:42.686 --> 43:43.686
kill it.

43:51.296 --> 43:52.528
- Who is that?

43:55.933 --> 43:58.935
- It's the dude from
the gas station.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.670
- Billy, what the...

44:02.339 --> 44:05.074
- Old Billy's homebrew delivery.

44:07.845 --> 44:09.846
Got your beer here.

44:09.848 --> 44:12.782
- Oh my god, he brought
my fucking beer.

44:12.784 --> 44:14.117
I'm gonna find out if he knows
about those assholes out...

44:14.119 --> 44:14.951
- woodrow, wait.

44:14.953 --> 44:15.785
- What?

44:15.787 --> 44:16.787
- Look.

44:20.057 --> 44:22.792
- Hey, hey, hey, hey behind
you, look behind you.

44:26.764 --> 44:27.764
Holy shit!

44:29.333 --> 44:32.068
- This can't be happening.

44:32.070 --> 44:34.804
- What are those things?

44:34.806 --> 44:36.039
- Go to the back, all right,

44:36.041 --> 44:37.473
we need to get the
fuck outta here.

44:37.475 --> 44:38.708
- Come on.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.844
- What is that, why
is this happening?

44:41.846 --> 44:45.782
- They're everywhere,
they surrounded the house.

44:45.784 --> 44:49.118
- What are you doing, man?

44:49.120 --> 44:50.353
- What do you think I'm doing?

44:50.355 --> 44:52.522
I'm gonna break into
the fucking house.

44:52.524 --> 44:55.558
- The pets will not come in.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.660
- What did you say?

44:57.662 --> 45:00.063
- They obey us, now we play.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.168
- What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

45:05.170 --> 45:08.004
- Your bitch kills babies.

45:08.006 --> 45:09.205
- What?

45:09.207 --> 45:11.674
- She's dying,
better go get her.

45:15.446 --> 45:16.446
- Zach.

45:17.181 --> 45:18.748
- Zach's not here.

45:20.284 --> 45:21.417
- Who are you?

45:21.419 --> 45:23.386
- We're Zach's friends.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.421
- Oh, god.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.423
- Help, help.

45:31.328 --> 45:32.795
Help, help, help.

45:35.966 --> 45:37.467
- Holy shit.
- - Oh my god.

45:37.469 --> 45:38.735
- What happened?

45:38.737 --> 45:39.969
- Call the fucking
ambulance now, go.

45:39.971 --> 45:41.771
- I'll go get towels.

45:45.309 --> 45:47.477
- Oh my god, baby,
what have you done?

45:47.479 --> 45:50.113
Oh, fuck, it's okay, it's okay.

45:53.150 --> 45:55.151
- Where are the phones?

46:01.825 --> 46:02.825
Zach?

46:03.761 --> 46:05.228
- They hate fire.

46:11.168 --> 46:14.337
They didn't want
anyone else to come.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.708
- Okay, did she call, did
she call the ambulance,

46:18.710 --> 46:19.909
did she call 'em?

46:19.911 --> 46:20.710
- Calm down, she's on it.

46:20.712 --> 46:22.311
- Okay, fuck, oh, fuck.

46:23.647 --> 46:25.848
She was pregnant, she was
fucking pregnant, man.

46:25.850 --> 46:27.383
She's gonna be fine, okay?

46:27.385 --> 46:28.818
No, look at me, man,
look at me, man,

46:28.820 --> 46:31.053
she's gonna be fucking fine.

46:31.055 --> 46:32.555
- Those things outside

46:32.557 --> 46:34.724
and what the fuck
is happening, man?

46:34.726 --> 46:35.958
Fuck.

46:35.960 --> 46:38.728
- I don't know, man, all
right, just calm down.

46:38.730 --> 46:39.730
- I...

46:42.266 --> 46:44.100
It's that freak's fault.

46:44.102 --> 46:46.269
I'm gonna make him
fix all of this shit,

46:46.271 --> 46:47.470
stay in here with her.

46:47.472 --> 46:48.504
- You need to fucking
stay in here, man,

46:48.506 --> 46:50.406
I can't fucking do this.

46:50.408 --> 46:52.241
- Oh, shit, oh, shit.

46:54.211 --> 46:55.978
Did you call the ambulance?

46:55.980 --> 46:56.980
- No.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.116
I'm sorry, woodrow.

47:00.118 --> 47:02.685
- What are you
talking about, why?

47:04.421 --> 47:08.524
Oh, no, no, no, my
Michelle, she's dying.

47:08.526 --> 47:11.994
Oh, fuck, I need a first,
where's the first aid kit?

47:11.996 --> 47:13.462
- We don't have one.

47:13.464 --> 47:17.200
- Yeah, yeah, we gotta have
something, come on, where is it?

47:21.104 --> 47:24.340
- You're okay, it's
okay, you're okay.

47:27.244 --> 47:28.878
Woodrow?

47:28.880 --> 47:31.113
- Please, don't scream.

47:43.994 --> 47:46.329
- Oh, fuck, fuck, oh, shit.

47:47.731 --> 47:48.965
I'm gonna take the car.

47:48.967 --> 47:50.433
- No, please, woodrow,
don't go out there.

47:50.435 --> 47:51.634
- No, I gotta do something.

47:51.636 --> 47:53.102
- If you go out there,
you're gonna die.

47:53.104 --> 47:56.505
- If she stays in
here, she's gonna die.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.876
Your fucking brother,

47:59.878 --> 48:02.478
your fucking brother
has to make them leave.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.480
- No, no, no, no, please,
please, please don't hurt him.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.449
- Make 'em leave,
you son of a bitch.

48:06.451 --> 48:07.984
- Get off him.

48:10.622 --> 48:13.289
- She told us your secret.

48:13.291 --> 48:16.492
- Michelle, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

48:16.494 --> 48:20.663
- She told us your cock was
so hard when you were dancing.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.399
- Michelle, shut the fuck up.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.634
- Dirty Jesse.

48:27.504 --> 48:29.071
Do you still want me?

48:29.073 --> 48:31.707
You can have me, I'm all yours.

48:35.078 --> 48:37.313
We will chop your
cock off, Jessie.

48:40.684 --> 48:42.418
- Stay away from me.

48:43.654 --> 48:46.656
- You have no guts, you cunt.

48:49.127 --> 48:50.127
- Oh, fuck.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.169
- You broke my heart.

49:00.171 --> 49:02.338
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

49:02.340 --> 49:04.173
- We think you're fun.

49:04.175 --> 49:06.809
- Hey, hey, open
the door, Jesse.

49:06.811 --> 49:07.810
- Get the fuck in here, man.

49:07.812 --> 49:09.312
- Jesse, come on.

49:09.314 --> 49:13.082
- Get the fuck in here, man,
just get the fuck in here.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.721
- Kiss me hard before you go.

49:24.127 --> 49:25.127
- Oh, fuck.

49:26.163 --> 49:29.098
- Holy what, what did you do?

49:29.100 --> 49:31.600
- She tried to fucking kill
me, man, she tried to fucking...

49:31.602 --> 49:33.135
- Oh, no.
- Oh my god.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.604
- She tried to fucking kill me.

49:35.606 --> 49:37.707
I can't fucking see.

49:37.709 --> 49:39.075
I can't fucking see,
man, I can't fucking see,

49:39.077 --> 49:40.576
why the fuck can't I see?

49:40.578 --> 49:43.312
Why can't I see, why, what's
wrong with my fucking eye?

49:43.314 --> 49:44.981
What's wrong with
my fucking eye?

49:55.692 --> 49:56.692
- Baby?

50:00.364 --> 50:05.267
Okay, baby, we need to
take that out of your eye.

50:05.269 --> 50:07.603
- Oh, fuck, it hurts so much.

50:07.605 --> 50:09.105
- I know, I know.

50:11.308 --> 50:13.676
But you still have to do it.

50:15.579 --> 50:16.579
- Oh, fuck.

50:26.858 --> 50:31.093
All right, let's just fucking
do it, let's fucking do this.

50:46.410 --> 50:50.146
- You know everything,
don't you, you freak?

51:00.357 --> 51:02.658
You made her kill our baby.

51:07.631 --> 51:10.900
You should've died in
that car with your mother.

51:14.704 --> 51:17.940
You're gonna pay for
what you've done.

51:23.747 --> 51:25.714
- Just do it, just
do it, just do it.

51:25.716 --> 51:27.016
- Okay.

51:31.455 --> 51:33.089
- Stop, stop, stop!

51:50.073 --> 51:53.142
- You're not gonna
hurt anyone else.

52:03.920 --> 52:07.556
- I'm waiting for you, woodrow.

52:07.558 --> 52:09.024
- What d'you say?

52:12.095 --> 52:14.330
- I'm here, woodrow.

52:31.214 --> 52:33.816
- Gonna take you to the hospital

52:33.818 --> 52:35.751
and they're gonna take
care of you, okay?

52:35.753 --> 52:36.753
- Okay.

52:39.256 --> 52:41.323
- Oh, I'm sorry.

52:43.994 --> 52:45.761
- I think my fucking
brain's damaged.

52:45.763 --> 52:46.695
- Okay, okay,

52:46.697 --> 52:47.663
- no, it's fucking damaged.

52:47.665 --> 52:49.298
- You're gonna be okay.

52:49.300 --> 52:50.533
- No, I'm not gonna
be okay, okay?

52:50.535 --> 52:52.835
I just lost my fucking eye.

52:57.607 --> 53:01.410
- Jesse, just tell me
what happened in there.

53:04.080 --> 53:06.916
- I don't know, you know, I...

53:06.918 --> 53:10.819
I was trying to stop
the blood, but...

53:10.821 --> 53:13.222
You know, she suddenly
stabbed me in the face.

53:13.224 --> 53:14.557
It wasn't her, though, you know,

53:14.559 --> 53:16.392
she was all messed up,

53:16.394 --> 53:18.327
she was talking different,

53:18.329 --> 53:20.196
I didn't understand it.

53:20.198 --> 53:22.298
- Well, what did she say?

53:22.300 --> 53:24.867
- I don't know, it doesn't
make any sense, you know,

53:24.869 --> 53:28.470
she kept talking like
Zach, she kept saying we.

53:28.472 --> 53:32.308
- Okay, did she say why
she did what she did?

53:33.310 --> 53:34.777
- Fuck, I don't fucking
know, all right,

53:34.779 --> 53:36.745
I don't have answers to every
fucking question you have.

53:36.747 --> 53:37.813
God damn it.

53:43.420 --> 53:46.055
- Why are you acting like this?

53:48.058 --> 53:49.525
Michelle is dead.

53:51.428 --> 53:53.729
Woodrow thinks
it's Zach's fault.

53:53.731 --> 53:57.967
I just need your support, okay,
please don't push me away.

54:00.303 --> 54:02.705
- I'm sorry, okay, you know,

54:04.140 --> 54:07.142
I'm just scared,
too, okay, you know?

54:07.144 --> 54:08.344
- Yeah.

54:08.346 --> 54:11.814
- Hey, look at me, okay,
we're gonna be okay.

54:44.414 --> 54:46.315
- You made me do this?

54:49.085 --> 54:52.154
- No, no, no, no, fuck this.

54:52.156 --> 54:53.088
No, I'm...

54:53.090 --> 54:55.224
- I was just a little kid.

54:55.992 --> 54:58.460
Why did you bully me?

54:58.462 --> 54:59.762
- I don't know.

55:00.930 --> 55:02.364
I'm sorry.

55:02.366 --> 55:04.099
I've changed.

55:04.101 --> 55:06.235
I'm different now.

55:06.237 --> 55:07.703
- Do you know where suicides go?

55:07.705 --> 55:08.937
- Oh, please, no.

55:08.939 --> 55:10.506
- That's where I'm
waiting for you.

55:10.508 --> 55:12.908
- No, please, stop,
man, I can't, I can't,

55:12.910 --> 55:14.576
I can't take it anymore.

55:14.578 --> 55:17.913
- Today will be the day you
pay for your consequences.

55:17.915 --> 55:20.416
You condemned me to
burn in hell forever.

55:20.418 --> 55:23.018
- No, no, no, no, Dennis.

55:23.020 --> 55:25.788
Dennis, I'm sorry, please.

55:25.790 --> 55:27.389
I, I didn't...

55:27.391 --> 55:28.791
It wasn't my fault.

55:28.793 --> 55:32.194
- Will pay.

55:39.869 --> 55:42.037
- What the hell was that?

55:55.418 --> 55:56.919
- Woodrow!

55:56.921 --> 55:59.755
- Holy shit, what have you done?

55:59.757 --> 56:00.757
Oh, fuck.

56:01.891 --> 56:02.925
Hold his head.

56:04.762 --> 56:05.728
I gotta get this outta you, man,

56:05.730 --> 56:08.063
I gotta get this outta you.

56:10.266 --> 56:11.100
Oh, geez.

56:11.102 --> 56:12.334
- Oh my god.

56:12.336 --> 56:13.535
- Hey, no, no, no, no,
don't, don't touch it,

56:13.537 --> 56:15.003
stop, stop that, look
at me, look at me,

56:15.005 --> 56:16.538
you're gonna make it worse,
okay, don't touch that.

56:16.540 --> 56:19.475
- Let's put him in here.

56:19.477 --> 56:21.310
- Move, I'll get him.

56:22.512 --> 56:23.512
Fuck.

56:29.552 --> 56:31.120
Oh, shit, no, no,
no, I can't move him,

56:31.122 --> 56:32.955
look, look, I think
he broke his leg.

56:32.957 --> 56:34.189
- Okay.

56:34.191 --> 56:35.858
- Hey, hey, we gotta
get him to the hospital,

56:35.860 --> 56:37.359
he's losing too much blood.

56:37.361 --> 56:38.794
- Jesse, we can't go to the
hospital, we can't go outside.

56:38.796 --> 56:40.362
Someone's out there.

56:40.364 --> 56:42.231
Okay, Zach said they're
not gonna come in here,

56:42.233 --> 56:44.566
so we just need to stay in here.

56:44.568 --> 56:46.702
- Where the fuck is Zach?

56:50.206 --> 56:51.273
- Oh my god.

56:52.575 --> 56:54.309
Zach, what happened?

56:56.346 --> 56:59.081
- I need them, Emily, they heal.

57:02.318 --> 57:03.719
- They heal.

57:03.721 --> 57:06.488
- What did he say?

57:06.490 --> 57:08.624
- He said they heal.

57:08.626 --> 57:10.259
- What's that supposed to mean?

57:10.261 --> 57:11.794
- All the things on the
windows and the witchcraft

57:11.796 --> 57:13.796
and the basement, it
has to do with the book.

57:13.798 --> 57:15.330
- What book, Emily?

57:15.332 --> 57:16.565
- The goetia, it talks about
being able to summon demons

57:16.567 --> 57:18.467
straight from hell and...

57:18.469 --> 57:20.102
People think they can help.

57:20.104 --> 57:21.104
- Help how?

57:22.405 --> 57:25.407
- Take over the
body and heal it.

57:25.409 --> 57:28.143
- Come on, that's
fucking bullshit, Emily.

57:28.145 --> 57:31.213
- Well, Jesse, that's what i
thought, too, but look around.

57:31.215 --> 57:32.681
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

57:32.683 --> 57:35.184
there has to be a logical
explanation for this,

57:35.186 --> 57:37.119
everything has a
reasonable explanation.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.488
- Okay, there's a
logical explanation

57:39.490 --> 57:42.758
for Michelle ripping her body
open and trying to kill you,

57:42.760 --> 57:46.228
and there's a logical explanation
for those things outside?

57:46.230 --> 57:48.764
- I don't know, maybe it's a
fucking virus or something.

57:48.766 --> 57:52.401
- Oh, it's a virus
that's making Zach talk.

57:53.703 --> 57:56.271
Look at woodrow for god sakes.

57:59.342 --> 58:00.843
- What about god?

58:02.045 --> 58:03.245
- What?

58:03.247 --> 58:04.446
- Well, where is he?

58:04.448 --> 58:05.948
If all these demons
and hell exists,

58:05.950 --> 58:08.050
that means god's out there
somewhere watching us,

58:08.052 --> 58:09.952
well, where the fuck is he?

58:16.993 --> 58:18.293
What d'you say?

58:21.030 --> 58:22.664
- Your god is dead.

58:42.485 --> 58:43.819
- Hit his head.

58:50.126 --> 58:51.627
- Do you think he's...

58:51.629 --> 58:53.662
- I don't know, em,
all I do know is that

58:53.664 --> 58:55.130
if you're right about
this book and stuff,

58:55.132 --> 58:56.932
it's just a matter of time
until one of us becomes that.

58:56.934 --> 58:58.367
- No, just.

58:58.369 --> 59:01.270
- They've all been hurt pretty
badly when turned and...

59:01.272 --> 59:02.604
Fuck, em, look at me.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.373
- No, Jesse, I won't
let them take you.

59:04.375 --> 59:06.275
- No, no, look.

59:06.277 --> 59:08.176
If they get inside me,

59:09.145 --> 59:10.445
don't hesitate.

59:15.451 --> 59:17.419
- Jesse, get the pills.

59:18.621 --> 59:20.489
- Emily, come on, i
don't wanna go alone.

59:20.491 --> 59:21.890
- Jesse, please.

59:22.859 --> 59:25.193
Okay, you're gonna be okay.

59:29.933 --> 59:30.933
- Fuck!

59:32.502 --> 59:33.502
Oh, shit.

59:53.923 --> 59:54.923
Sarah?

59:57.527 --> 59:59.695
- I was in love with you.

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.099
- No, don't say that,
that's not true.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.235
- I trusted you,
you didn't stop him.

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.339
- No, that's not true, there
was nothing I could do,

01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:12.307
it wasn't my fault.

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:14.443
- You let him kill me.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:16.011
- I know, I froze,

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:18.080
I didn't know what to do.

01:00:18.082 --> 01:00:19.982
I didn't know what
to do, I'm sorry.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:22.050
- You were a coward.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:25.954
You broke my heart, now
I'm gonna break yours.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:33.595
- Zach, please stop, i
can't take it anymore.

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.836
Oh, Zach, I'm here with you.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.740
- Jesse.

01:00:45.508 --> 01:00:46.508
Jesse.

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.280
- I'm sorry, Sarah, I'm sorry.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.488
- Jesse, no.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.457
- Oh, what, she was just here.

01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:03.692
- Who?

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:07.496
- Sarah, my student,
the girl that got shot,

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:09.331
sh was just here,
she was just here.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.233
- No, Jesse, nobody was here.
- Yes, she was.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.001
- No, that's just the demons
playing with your mind.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:16.104
Jesse, none of this is real.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:17.673
- I almost did it.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.742
I couldn't control myself.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:24.146
- Okay, come on, I think
i know how to stop this.

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:25.148
- How?

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:28.417
- The woman who
used to live here,

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:31.219
her spell book's
in the basement.

01:01:34.924 --> 01:01:36.324
- All right, if this
lady summoned them,

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:38.927
there has to be some way
of sending them back.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:41.596
- Yeah, must be something here.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:29.811
- What a useless body.

01:02:41.557 --> 01:02:43.125
- You promised me.

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:48.530
- You will be healed, but
the game's not over yet.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.912
- Wait a minute,
what does it say?

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.648
- It says that these
things that are outside

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.216
they're called the guardians,

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:42.218
and then...

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:46.655
They're descriptions
of all the demons,

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.890
there's seven of them.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:52.260
- Seven, does it say
how to defeat them?

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:56.965
- No, I don't think so.

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.835
- Let me see these.

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.475
- What is it?

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:42.911
- It says they can
only use your body

01:04:42.913 --> 01:04:44.980
if you let them heal it.

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.851
- That's why they make
you hurt yourself.

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:52.254
- Keep the house sealed.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:53.889
- Sealed with what?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.327
- I don't know,
there's nothing else.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.663
- These symbols, Emily,
you've read about them,

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:03.565
what do they mean?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.066
- These are from the goetia,

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:08.436
and each and every demon
has one of these symbols.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:10.238
They call 'em sigils.

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.376
Oh my god.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:19.781
The house was sealed
when we came here.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:20.916
- The boards.

01:05:23.085 --> 01:05:24.386
They're outside.

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:26.221
- Okay, well, we have to
make our own seals then.

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:27.289
- Okay, how?

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.225
- We need to figure out
which of these symbols

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:33.495
goes with the
demons she summoned.

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.330
- I remember the
symbols of the board

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:37.832
and the windows I pulled off.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.770
It was sabnock,
yeah, it was sabnock.

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.311
- Did you just call us?

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:52.847
- Jesse!

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:56.751
Sabnock.

01:06:00.022 --> 01:06:02.290
Please let us go.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.759
- Oh, we can't stop the game.

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:09.230
- But I don't
wanna play anymore.

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:15.003
- You people are so much fun.

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:20.041
There is no premise,

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:22.677
your filthy nature is the game.

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:27.015
I'll play, please don't tell me.

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:30.418
- Each and every one
of you is a sinner.

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:36.624
Each and every one of you
will do anything to live.

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:42.764
We've played this
game so many times

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:49.337
and every time, we see people
killing their loved ones,

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:53.742
mothers slaughtering
their children

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:56.811
and brothers betraying
their sisters

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.280
just like Zach.

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:01.416
And you?

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:06.121
Well, you're not different,
you selfish bitch.

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.946
- Jesse, he's gone.

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.918
- I won't let them take me.

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.721
- Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:41.222
- Zach, he knows.

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:05.980
- I love you, baby,
I'll fix everything,

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:08.416
just hang in there, okay?

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:09.418
- Hurry.

01:08:19.694 --> 01:08:21.496
- You made the seals.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.801
- They told me
they would heal me

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:30.537
- you knew what to do
all along, didn't you?

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.911
- I had to watch our mom burn

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.680
and I couldn't do anything.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:41.515
- I'm so sorry, Zach.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:45.220
I'm so sorry.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:50.524
- I just wanted to be normal,
i didn't want any of this.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:58.533
- And these signs, they'll
make the nightmare end?

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:03.505
And what happens to
you when they're gone?

01:09:05.374 --> 01:09:06.674
- I don't care.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.943
- Okay, okay.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:42.977
- We told you everything
about us, Zach.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.885
Been trapped in his own body.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.157
You didn't know what
it's like to be loved.

01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:01.329
I thought you
understood what we feel.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:04.032
- I know

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:07.502
what it's like to be loved.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.605
- Do you really?

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.780
Emily.

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:24.619
Now, we know your
filthy lover's secrets.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:33.428
Sarah, what a lovely
young cunt she had.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:36.898
- You liars.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.066
- Oh, are we?

01:10:39.101 --> 01:10:40.635
Think about it.

01:10:40.637 --> 01:10:43.538
He hated taking care
of your brother.

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:47.609
He despised hearing you
whine every fucking day.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:52.247
Oh, Jesse, I can't right now,

01:10:52.249 --> 01:10:55.250
I have to give Zach
his medication.

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.020
We're gonna get inside you

01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:01.256
and rip your fucking soul.

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:08.931
You whore.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:12.767
We are the bornless
ones, we are...

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:23.344
- I'm so sorry, Jesse.

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.910
- Now I lay me down to sleep,

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:58.646
I pray the lord my soul to keep,

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.650
and if I die before I wake,

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:05.386
I pray the lord my soul to take.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:11.592
You remember that
one, don't you?

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:16.397
- Mom?

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:23.504
- We were so alone
after you left us,

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.573
just me and my baby boy.

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:31.512
- I wish I was there with you.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:35.683
- Oh, I wanted that so
badly, too, but you won't.

01:12:40.155 --> 01:12:41.889
- I'm so sorry, mom.

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:46.461
- It's all fine,
baby, it's all fine.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:52.066
That day I wanted me and
my boy to go together

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:56.704
to a place where
everyone was happy,

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.840
I wanted him to be happy.

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:03.578
I couldn't watch
him suffer anymore.

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:07.548
- I was so selfish,
i was so stupid,

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.817
I just wanted a normal life.

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:13.054
- I don't blame you,
i love you, baby.

01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:18.059
We can fix everything right now.

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.163
We can all be together again.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.900
- What do you want me to do?

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:30.338
- You know what to do, darling.

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:40.047
You can end his
suffering right now.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.018
Be a good sister, just once.

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:51.626
Good girl.

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:56.030
We love you so much.

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:05.039
- Mom, do you remember
what you said to me

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.042
the last time we were together?

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:10.111
- Of course, I remember.

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:13.381
I told you how much I love you.

01:14:13.383 --> 01:14:17.618
You and Zach were the best
things that ever happened to me.

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:22.256
- You told me never
to give up on him.

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:26.761
And I did.

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:31.566
And I'm not gonna do that again.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:41.175
You're not my mom,
my mom's dead.

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:45.313
- Don't say that, baby,
you're hurting me.

01:14:45.315 --> 01:14:46.315
- Fuck you.

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.183
- You made me kill myself

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:52.587
and now I burn in hell,
you ungrateful bitch.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.690
- My mom didn't kill
herself, it was an accident.

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:58.292
- You want him to have
this miserable life,

01:14:58.294 --> 01:15:02.196
you can't take care of
him, you selfish whore.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:07.468
You think you're smart,
you stupid bitch,

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:13.574
you're not going anywhere
because we won't let you.

01:15:13.576 --> 01:15:15.776
- Try and stop me,
you motherfuckers.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:19.113
- We can heal your
brother, he needs us.

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:23.818
- He has me.

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:31.125
- You are fun.

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.185
- Zach?

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.659
Zach, it's all over.

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.995
They're gone now.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:08.997
- Emily.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.800
Emily, please help.

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:13.802
Help me.

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:18.105
Emily.

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:19.107
Emily.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:22.743
Emily, please help, help, help.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:23.945
- Jesse.

01:16:23.947 --> 01:16:26.981
- Oh, oh, baby, it hurts so bad.

01:16:26.983 --> 01:16:27.983
Oh, oh.

01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:32.687
Oh, why'd you do this to me?

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:35.022
- I'm sorry, I had no choice.

01:16:35.024 --> 01:16:36.757
- Oh, are they gone?

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:41.629
Emily, please, please,
please stay here,

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:44.031
stay here, take it out of me.

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:47.868
Please, baby, do it,
take it out of me.

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:48.870
Please.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.311
- Oh!

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:05.119
Oh, baby, everything's gonna
be all right, I'm here for you.

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:08.956
- We need to play.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:10.157
- What?

01:17:10.159 --> 01:17:11.159
- We play!

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:17.698
Such a pleasure watching you
creatures killing one another.

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.502
So fun giving you the pain.

01:17:23.005 --> 01:17:25.072
No, don't be so selfish,

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.808
the game is not over.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:42.790
- Zach, I don't feel my legs.

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:03.344
- Come back.

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.414
Don't leave us.

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:08.816
You need us.

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:11.886
We can heal.
