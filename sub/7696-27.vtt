01:29.630 --> 01:33.342
Whoever jumps first is chicken.

01:53.321 --> 01:56.240
I knew you'd chicken out.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.910
Huh?

02:20.681 --> 02:23.392
You play chicken long enough, you fry.

02:58.969 --> 03:00.221
My purse!

03:00.346 --> 03:01.972
Help! A thief!

03:07.853 --> 03:10.773
I'm telling you, it was a leprechaun.

03:11.065 --> 03:15.569
Really, ma'am? You expect me
to believe you saw a little green man?

03:17.113 --> 03:18.155
Oh!

03:20.616 --> 03:21.742
Hey!

03:36.298 --> 03:38.092
Whoa!

03:50.396 --> 03:52.273
Leprechauns and batmen...

03:52.732 --> 03:54.275
What's Gotham coming to?

03:57.945 --> 03:59.321
Leprechauns?

04:05.202 --> 04:06.662
Leprechauns, Alfred.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.666
Pardon?

04:12.626 --> 04:16.589
- Not in the mood for Brahms, are we?
- You think I'm crazy, don't you?

04:17.131 --> 04:18.799
In what sense, Master Bruce?

04:19.258 --> 04:22.678
Seriously, you don't believe
I saw a leprechaun.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.139
Did he have a pot of gold?

04:25.806 --> 04:28.184
Sir, I believe you saw something.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.394
Maybe I need a rest.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.564
I do believe a break
from Wayne Enterprises

04:33.647 --> 04:35.691
and crime fighting would do wonders.

04:36.025 --> 04:38.277
Perhaps a vacation. A little golf?

04:38.360 --> 04:39.528
Sounds boring.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.905
In the Bahamas?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.698
Hot and boring.

04:43.282 --> 04:46.285
No, Alfred, I think
this is a job for Batman.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.915
You have a fine flair
for dramatics, sir.

04:51.123 --> 04:53.751
Why, thank you, Alfred.

04:57.004 --> 04:58.047
The theater district?

04:58.130 --> 05:01.175
Yes, I think it's time for an encore.

06:37.271 --> 06:41.108
Hurry up!
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

06:41.233 --> 06:46.447
Are you ready for your lessons?
Yes? I think so. I think so.

06:46.530 --> 06:51.493
Well, so am I. Your teacher.
Your leader. Your king.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.704
Ready, I am. Yes.

07:00.252 --> 07:04.924
Lesson number one is...
No talking!

07:06.717 --> 07:09.136
Children are to be seen
and not heard.

07:09.803 --> 07:13.057
We are the Underdwellers.
We are the silent ones.

07:13.140 --> 07:16.894
We follow the invisible creed.
But, but, but...

07:17.019 --> 07:21.815
Someone was talking.
You. You, you, you were heard.

07:21.899 --> 07:24.818
And we all know the punishment
for talking.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.987
Don't we, boys and girls?

07:32.743 --> 07:35.746
I think he needs to see the light.

07:36.121 --> 07:38.832
Yes, I <i>do.</i>

07:39.375 --> 07:44.004
A few hours in the light
will make Jack a bright boy.

07:45.339 --> 07:50.594
And now, lesson two.
All of you up to the streets!

07:50.678 --> 07:55.140
Bring back pretties,
lots and lots of pretties for your king.

07:55.724 --> 07:57.351
Now!

08:31.969 --> 08:33.429
I thought so.

09:08.505 --> 09:10.007
Dead bolt.

09:58.722 --> 10:01.141
Just a second, son.
I'm not going to hurt you.

10:03.018 --> 10:04.186
Wait.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.300
Open.

11:19.136 --> 11:20.554
Good evening, Alfred.

11:20.888 --> 11:21.930
Sir.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.100
Might this wee one
be a leprechaun?

11:25.475 --> 11:29.688
This, Alfred, is our guest.
I'd like you to take care of him.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.192
Me? But I know nothing of children.

11:33.525 --> 11:34.776
You'll do fine.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.862
Feed him, clean him and put him to bed.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.530
Well, perhaps.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.657
Not in that order.

11:48.081 --> 11:50.375
Rise and shine,
master leprechaun.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.169
Time to be up and about.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.182
First a bath, don't you think?

12:07.851 --> 12:08.894
Do you have a name?

12:11.063 --> 12:14.358
I hope you don't expect me
to guess it. Fred?

12:16.526 --> 12:18.528
Pete? Leon?

12:19.029 --> 12:21.657
How about a little help? Can you talk?

12:23.659 --> 12:26.245
Gotcha.

12:26.536 --> 12:29.122
You'll feel much better
when you're clean.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.506
And smell better too, I trust.

12:55.190 --> 12:58.610
Frog, the rolls, if you please.

12:59.778 --> 13:01.530
You're not Frog.

13:03.198 --> 13:04.616
Where is he?

13:05.367 --> 13:08.620
He's not here! Not here!

13:08.704 --> 13:13.125
And after all I've done for you
ungrateful little monsters...

13:13.375 --> 13:15.919
I took you in when
nobody else would have you.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.880
It is I who care for you.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.675
I who provide for you,

13:21.758 --> 13:26.179
and only I who knows
what's good for you!

13:26.263 --> 13:29.057
Would you rather I sent you
back into the light?

13:29.516 --> 13:32.978
Back to those who
hurt you and sent you away?

13:35.856 --> 13:38.900
There will be nothing to eat
until Frog is found!

13:39.735 --> 13:43.280
Now, outwith you.
Out with you!

13:52.039 --> 13:55.125
Now, now. Let's start with
some basic table manners.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.211
Knife, fork, spoon.

14:01.298 --> 14:04.009
Oh, dear, I could've sworn I--

14:04.301 --> 14:07.095
No matter. As they say, "Dig in."

14:12.976 --> 14:14.394
I wash, you dry.

14:15.854 --> 14:19.649
Now then, doesn't it feel good
to be doing honest work?

14:22.319 --> 14:23.695
What? Wait!

14:25.614 --> 14:26.615
Charming.

14:44.549 --> 14:47.177
<i>Now, see here, we're supposed
to be working.</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:50.931
I wonder if I was that much trouble.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.449
Oh, dear. That is extremely dangerous.

15:09.741 --> 15:11.993
You must put it down
before you hurt someone.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.832
Children and guns do not mix, ever.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.752
It wasn't loaded,
but it could have been.

15:21.336 --> 15:22.963
I need your help.

15:55.287 --> 15:56.496
Evidence.

16:02.794 --> 16:03.920
Where is he?

16:48.548 --> 16:53.053
I don't know what kind of barbarian
did this to you, but it's over.

16:53.386 --> 16:56.223
And from now on you'll be treated
like human beings.

16:56.306 --> 16:59.267
I think we'll have something
to say about that.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.354
Yes, we will.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.568
Welcome our guests.

17:42.894 --> 17:46.147
Crush him! Destroy that
costumed freak.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.587
I'll show you who's the ruler
of this kingdom.

18:08.712 --> 18:09.963
Put him down.

18:10.630 --> 18:14.676
- Now!
- It's feeding time for my pretties.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.088
Great.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.010
And I thought you were endangered.

18:57.218 --> 19:00.347
Bravo. Bravo.

19:01.056 --> 19:04.893
You've caused me great distress,
you evil bat.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.770
Yes. Yes. Yes, you have.

19:06.936 --> 19:12.317
You've hurt my pretty pets, and
you've frightened my beloved children.

19:12.776 --> 19:16.154
- Beloved children?
- Yes.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.825
I feed them, I clothe them,
I discipline them,

19:20.950 --> 19:23.244
and I teach them a trade.

19:23.870 --> 19:29.000
And now I will teach you something.

19:36.966 --> 19:38.259
Grab my hand!

19:38.593 --> 19:40.970
Never!

19:47.852 --> 19:50.522
A gruesome fate for a gruesome man.

19:52.565 --> 19:54.317
I rather enjoyed it.

19:54.442 --> 19:58.488
I told you, they're my pretties.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.367
Have a nice swim.

20:15.630 --> 20:17.006
Later.

20:42.031 --> 20:43.950
What? You!

21:03.595 --> 21:06.473
Why? Why? Why?

21:06.556 --> 21:09.517
I don't pass sentence.
That's for the courts.

21:10.101 --> 21:11.478
But this time...

21:12.103 --> 21:17.066
This time I am sorely tempted
to do the job myself.

21:31.539 --> 21:32.582
The light.

21:33.833 --> 21:34.918
The light.

22:20.463 --> 22:21.464
