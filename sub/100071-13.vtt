Mm, yeah. Uh, sir,
to make you the wealthiest man

10:41.007 --> 10:42.442
in town again,
I've assembled a team

10:42.509 --> 10:44.978
of the greatest mathematicians
and cryptographers

10:45.044 --> 10:46.479
to ever leave their rooms.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.082
They're here to develop...
Burnscoin.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.717
Will there be actual coins?

10:50.783 --> 10:52.218
If so, make sure they're made

10:52.285 --> 10:54.087
from something men
must die mining.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.056
Is there an ivory
that comes from people?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.425
So, here are the programmers
working on your currency.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.895
And I've discovered some serious
issues with this nuclear plant.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.831
By my calculations,
the cracks in the coolant pipes

11:04.898 --> 11:06.599

Smithers, give this poindexter
a McKinley Rub.

Now, listen here,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.076
You are here for one reason
and one reason only:

11:17.143 --> 11:20.647
to create a pseudo currency
like the Bitcoin or the peso

11:20.713 --> 11:22.048
that will make me rich.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.484
So rich I could buy
ten NFL teams.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.952
Not the Jets.

doing comes out of anger.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.001

11:42.068 --> 11:44.971
‐No.
‐Please, you're safe here.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.654

Wayland, I'm going

12:18.471 --> 12:19.806

12:19.872 --> 12:21.407

(chuckling)

19:45.685 --> 19:47.953
I had a billion dollars‐‐
what have I done?!

19:52.425 --> 19:54.694
Ugh. Ten glorious days of peace.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.462
I was able to finish
my dissertation.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.065
Losing a billion dollars
means nothing

19:59.131 --> 20:01.600
as long as I see you again.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.339
