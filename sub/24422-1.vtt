WEBVTT

00:04.909 --> 00:06.743
Man:
Children were molested here!

00:06.743 --> 00:11.159
And it's directly connected
to the football program.

00:11.159 --> 00:14.034
Man 2:
Joe Paterno did know
that Sandusky

00:14.034 --> 00:16.242
- was abusing boys
in the shower.
- No, he did not!

00:16.242 --> 00:18.076
Man 3:
I firmly believe,
in his mind,

00:18.076 --> 00:19.909
he did what
he thought was right.

00:19.909 --> 00:21.410
Man 4:
I think Joe Paterno's
getting thrown

00:21.410 --> 00:23.034
under the bus here
a little bit.

00:23.034 --> 00:24.577
Man 5: He is not
the Attorney General,

00:24.577 --> 00:25.993
he's the football coach.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.743
Man 7:
He was the Godfather!

00:27.743 --> 00:32.368
He was aware of what happened,
and allowed it to happen.

00:32.368 --> 00:36.118
Woman:
Joe! Where are you going?

00:36.118 --> 00:37.785
I'm going to the john.

00:37.785 --> 00:39.243
It's back here.

00:39.243 --> 00:41.785
It's right across the hall
from where we just were.

00:41.785 --> 00:43.493
Come on!

00:43.493 --> 00:45.493
Oh, yeah.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.159
I got turned around.

00:48.951 --> 00:51.118
Yeah, it's just
right over here
across the hall.

02:00.951 --> 02:04.076
Announcer: Eight inches
of winter's wrath expected,

02:04.076 --> 02:07.993
as Joe Paterno
seeks win number 409

02:07.993 --> 02:11.076
to surpass all
Division I football coaches.

02:11.076 --> 02:13.743
- Man: Take one.
- Man 2: Give me the stats
on Bolden and McGloin.

02:13.743 --> 02:15.034
Go to mascot.

02:20.702 --> 02:22.660
Commentator: Joe Paterno
up in the booth again today.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.368
That is certainly not
his preference.

02:24.368 --> 02:25.909
Announcer: Joe is coaching
from the press box today

02:25.909 --> 02:27.535
due to a hip injury sustained

02:27.535 --> 02:29.243
in practice
a couple weeks back.

02:35.201 --> 02:37.702
- Paterno: Guido.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.493
Bobby, no shots of Joe
in the booth.

02:41.493 --> 02:43.285
Man:
Look, look. Kay?

02:43.285 --> 02:45.827
- Busted.
- N-Number 31, please.

02:45.827 --> 02:48.243
- Give me the camera.
- Nope, nope. I'm deleting.

02:48.243 --> 02:49.785
Security:
No pictures of JoePa.

02:49.785 --> 02:51.368
Announcer:
As college football seems

02:51.368 --> 02:53.034
to change more rapidly
than ever,

02:53.034 --> 02:55.076
he remains the constant.

02:55.076 --> 02:56.618
JoePa. Penn state.

02:56.618 --> 02:59.785
At age 84, he is not
just still in the game,

02:59.785 --> 03:01.909
in many ways, he  is  the game.

03:01.909 --> 03:06.034
And with one more win,
another milestone.

03:06.034 --> 03:07.827
And there's the kick!

03:07.827 --> 03:08.993
Penn state offense
will take over

03:08.993 --> 03:11.660
on its own 35-yard line.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.243
Ready in blue?

03:13.243 --> 03:15.076
McGloin out of the shotgun,
heaving long...

03:16.743 --> 03:18.368
Commentator:
We asked Joe Paterno,

03:18.368 --> 03:19.410
"How do you get that message

03:19.410 --> 03:20.410
down to the sideline?"

03:20.410 --> 03:21.410
He writes it down,

03:21.410 --> 03:22.451
"If I call 41 power,

03:22.451 --> 03:23.868
I better see 41 power."

03:23.868 --> 03:26.076
All right. Split left,
drag 46 strong.

03:26.076 --> 03:28.702
Watch if they sub.
Check their angle
if they do.

03:28.702 --> 03:30.159
Catch 'em by surprise.

03:30.159 --> 03:32.326
Announcer:
And the snow continues to fall.

03:32.326 --> 03:35.451
Redd takes it on second down...

03:35.451 --> 03:37.951
and they get another Penn State
first down at the 25.

03:37.951 --> 03:41.451
Reporter: Here at Penn State,
we've still got 0-0,

03:41.451 --> 03:44.285
but the crowd could not
be more electric.

03:44.285 --> 03:46.743
Everybody here is wondering
if JoePa can deliver

03:46.743 --> 03:50.410
an historic 409th win
for the Nittany Lions.

03:50.410 --> 03:51.868
Announcer:
And the tailback---

03:51.868 --> 03:54.577
Bolden fumbles!
Illinois has got it.

03:54.577 --> 03:58.243
- Shit.
- A straight fumble
by the sophomore...

03:58.243 --> 04:00.410
Let's go, defense!

04:00.410 --> 04:03.743
Get that motherfucker
out of this game right now!

04:03.743 --> 04:04.868
Who the fuck was that?

04:04.868 --> 04:06.201
They want Bolden
out of the game.

04:06.201 --> 04:08.410
- No.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.076
Keep him in.

04:10.076 --> 04:11.993
Give me a shot of Bolden
on the sidelines.

04:15.368 --> 04:16.909
Announcer:
End of the first half,

04:16.909 --> 04:18.660
exactly where we started:

04:18.660 --> 04:19.660
Zero-zero.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.993
Stupid mother--

04:23.618 --> 04:24.827
- No.

04:24.827 --> 04:27.660
By the time I get
down with this gimp,

04:27.660 --> 04:29.993
halftime will be over.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.201
Coach is stayin' up here.

04:33.201 --> 04:35.326
Jay's comin' down.

04:37.493 --> 04:39.660
Woman: Jay Is on the move--
without his dad.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.410
Man:
Jay in the locker room?

04:41.410 --> 04:42.660
That's insane.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.493
- They hate him.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.993
Yeah,
he's a total doorknob.

04:45.993 --> 04:48.034
Why do you think
Joe won't retire?

04:48.034 --> 04:49.660
Oh, what? Like if they
wait long enough,

04:49.660 --> 04:51.785
he'll turn
into head coach material?

04:51.785 --> 04:55.243
You motherfuckers!
Hey, hey, listen to me!

04:55.243 --> 04:57.577
You think you can get
on the headset and talk
to me like that?!

04:57.577 --> 04:59.243
What are you guys,
a bunch of fucking--

05:04.201 --> 05:05.618
Back off!

05:05.618 --> 05:07.535
You were out there!
Show some respect!

05:07.535 --> 05:10.201
- Come on.
- Give me a break!

05:10.201 --> 05:12.577
Honey, you remember
Jerry Sandusky and Dottie.

05:12.577 --> 05:14.243
Good to see you.
How ya doin'?

05:14.243 --> 05:15.909
They need you back
on that line, Jerry.

05:15.909 --> 05:17.909
- We miss you.
- They're doin' okay.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.410
You still think
he's a pedophile?

05:28.827 --> 05:30.410
You know, nobody read
your article.

05:30.410 --> 05:31.410
Fuck you.

05:31.410 --> 05:33.909
It's been six months.

05:33.909 --> 05:35.743
That popcorn kernel didn't pop.

05:35.743 --> 05:36.618
Time to move on.

05:38.118 --> 05:39.535
That's just my opinion.

05:39.535 --> 05:42.743
Well, nobody's asking
for your opinion.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.909
We got a heads-up
from the attorney general's
office.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.243
They're charging Jerry
in the next few weeks.

05:47.243 --> 05:48.493
What, the business
with the shower?

05:48.493 --> 05:50.577
They have more
than one incident.

05:50.577 --> 05:51.909
What, with the same kid?

05:51.909 --> 05:53.410
Multiple incidents
with the same kid,

05:53.410 --> 05:54.368
and multiple kids.

05:54.368 --> 05:55.368
Oh, Jesus.

05:55.368 --> 05:56.743
All in our locker room?

05:56.743 --> 06:00.868
I don't know.
Look, evidently...

06:00.868 --> 06:04.034
you two might be named
in the indictment.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.410
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

06:05.410 --> 06:07.201
Cynthia says
they've got no case.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.493
She's gonna
get it thrown out.

06:09.493 --> 06:11.076
We just need
to ride it out.

06:11.076 --> 06:12.951
That's easy
for you to say,
Graham.

06:12.951 --> 06:14.993
I am in this
a hundred percent
with you.

06:14.993 --> 06:19.034
Oh, we're-- we're indicted
alongside an accused pedophile

06:19.034 --> 06:20.451
and you're say-- Ohh.

06:20.451 --> 06:23.785
Wow, I just hit
the motherlode.

06:23.785 --> 06:25.285
You're not
taking a fall, Gary.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.660
I will make sure
that doesn't happen.

06:27.660 --> 06:29.076
Hey, guys.
Can I get a quick hit?

06:29.076 --> 06:30.368
Of course.

06:30.368 --> 06:31.951
Ready one, take one.

06:31.951 --> 06:33.451
Reporter: I'm here

of how respected,

06:54.285 --> 06:57.951
how revered, Joe Paterno is
here at Penn State,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.868
look at this:
a monument they built to him

07:00.868 --> 07:03.034
calling him a coach,
an educator,

07:03.034 --> 07:04.993
and a humanitarian.

07:07.451 --> 07:09.285
- We are!

07:09.285 --> 07:10.451
- We are!

07:10.451 --> 07:12.034

07:31.451 --> 07:33.410
Slow push him, slow push him.

07:33.410 --> 07:35.368

Third and goal.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.285
McGloin fumbles the football,

07:37.285 --> 07:40.201
picks it up again,
sacked at the 15.

07:40.201 --> 07:44.034
That is the sixth fumble
of the day by Penn State.

07:44.034 --> 07:46.285
Fourth and goal,
the kicking unit comes out.

07:46.285 --> 07:48.201
Fera's 30-yarder

07:48.201 --> 07:50.368
is...good!

07:50.368 --> 07:52.243
Penn State's on the board.

07:52.243 --> 07:53.868
It's seven-three.

07:53.868 --> 07:55.451

07:55.451 --> 07:57.743
Scheelhaase is gonna run again

08:06.285 --> 08:08.577
80 yards for
the Penn State offense.

08:08.577 --> 08:10.410
Nittany Lions need a touchdown.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.577
What's the story
with Moye?

08:12.577 --> 08:14.243
Fractured
metatarsal.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.577
Doctor says he can go
if it's an emergency.

08:16.577 --> 08:18.743
Well, this looks
like an emergency.

08:20.118 --> 08:21.076
You got Moye?

08:21.076 --> 08:23.076
Moye! Moye! Get Moye!

08:23.076 --> 08:26.243
Moye, let's go!
Come on, come on,

from Scranton.

08:32.743 --> 08:35.451
McGloin throws,
it's completed!

08:35.451 --> 08:38.284
And who makes the grab
but Derek Moye,

08:38.284 --> 08:41.076
coming back from a broken bone
in his left foot.

08:41.076 --> 08:43.909
Jay: Now we're in business.
They're gonna crowd the line,

08:43.909 --> 08:45.535

- Fourth down and sixth.
- Let's go!

09:00.243 --> 09:02.201
Penn State needs to convert.

09:02.201 --> 09:05.285
McGloin heaves it
to the end zone for Moye--

09:05.285 --> 09:06.951
It is...

09:06.951 --> 09:11.785
incomplete! But there are
multiple flags on the play.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.285
Penn State's gonna
get another shot.

09:13.285 --> 09:14.743

Penn State needs

09:41.368 --> 09:43.951
McGloin handing off, Silas...

He's in the end zone!

Touchdown, Penn State!

09:51.868 --> 09:54.827

09:54.827 --> 09:57.159
Penn State hoping

09:57.159 --> 10:01.159

win number 409,

10:01.159 --> 10:02.577
making him the winningest coach

10:02.577 --> 10:04.159
in the history
of Division I football.

10:04.159 --> 10:08.535
Five seconds.

No good! Penn State wins!

10:22.368 --> 10:24.535

as head coach at Penn State....

10:50.868 --> 10:53.535
- Sara Ganim.

11:05.034 --> 11:07.702
Holy fucking shit.

11:07.702 --> 11:10.076
Ganim: Criminal charges,
Gerald Sandusky.

11:10.076 --> 11:11.493
40 counts.

11:11.493 --> 11:14.159
Involuntary, deviant
sexual intercourse,

11:14.159 --> 11:16.034
person less
than 16 years of age.

11:16.034 --> 11:17.577
Indecent assault,

11:17.577 --> 11:19.243
person less
than 16 years of age.

11:19.243 --> 11:22.201
- Aggravated indecent assault--
- Person less than 13  years.

11:22.201 --> 11:23.159
Jesus Chri--

11:23.159 --> 11:24.285
What the fuck.

11:24.285 --> 11:26.076
W

11:26.076 --> 11:27.702
- Reload. Reload--
- I'm reloading.

11:27.702 --> 11:29.243
- I don't know.

11:29.243 --> 11:30.201
Give me a second.

11:31.410 --> 11:32.868
Every other site's working.

11:34.618 --> 11:35.868
They pulled it.

11:44.243 --> 11:45.285
Boy : Mike.

11:45.285 --> 11:46.951
Man:
Hey, man, are you home?

11:46.951 --> 11:48.493
- No, I'm on my way.

11:48.493 --> 11:50.451
She told me
I could take the car.

11:50.451 --> 11:52.118
- I didn't--
-  No, it's fine. Listen,

11:52.118 --> 11:53.577
I need you
to pull over for a second.

11:53.577 --> 11:55.159
Can you do that?

12:03.493 --> 12:06.951
Man : Okay, look.
The charges against Jerry
went up online.

12:06.951 --> 12:08.827
They disappeared
like a minute later,

12:08.827 --> 12:10.785
which means
somebody probably
posted them by mistake,

12:10.785 --> 12:12.451
but a lot of people saw it,
so...

12:12.451 --> 12:15.076
It's happening now.
They're gonna arrest him.

12:15.076 --> 12:17.743
Probably tomorrow morning,
Sunday at the latest,

12:17.743 --> 12:20.618
and they're gonna have to post
the grand jury presentment

12:20.618 --> 12:22.243
when they're ready
to bring him in,

12:22.243 --> 12:24.660
so the whole story's
gonna be there.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.993
It's public.

12:26.993 --> 12:28.827
And I won't say your name.

12:28.827 --> 12:30.951
May use your initials, but...

12:30.951 --> 12:33.201
it's happening.

12:39.785 --> 12:40.993
Aaron?

12:43.159 --> 12:46.285
Hey, buddy. Hey.

12:55.368 --> 12:56.368
Woman: Hey, Joe.

12:56.368 --> 12:57.326
Paterno: Yeah.

12:57.326 --> 12:58.618
You wanna have dinner

12:58.618 --> 12:59.827
with Don and Shirley
on Sunday night?

12:59.827 --> 13:01.618
No.

13:01.618 --> 13:03.326
Come on, they want
to celebrate the win.

13:03.326 --> 13:05.951
Well, let 'em go celebrate
by themselves.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.868
So, no?
- Well, I...

13:08.868 --> 13:11.535
All right, let's see
how it plays out on Sunday.

13:11.535 --> 13:13.535
Well, I've got
a board meeting
in Philly.

13:13.535 --> 13:16.535
Maybe after a day by himself,
he'll want to be, you know--

13:16.535 --> 13:19.827
You asked me a question.
Don't ignore the answer.

13:19.827 --> 13:21.159
Oh, hang on one second, Sheryl.

13:21.159 --> 13:22.410
I got Scotty on the other line.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.243
Hey, Scotty.
I'm on the phone.

13:24.243 --> 13:27.368
- Scotty: Ma, I need
to talk to Dad.
- Okay.

13:27.368 --> 13:29.909
Uh, Joe, call Scotty
when I'm off.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.368
I'll call him when I finish
the practice script.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.785
Scotty,
he's gonna call you back
when he's finished

13:34.785 --> 13:36.159
with the practice scripts,
okay?

13:36.159 --> 13:38.076
No, no, no, no!
Ma, I gotta ta--

13:38.076 --> 13:41.702
- Yeah, Sheryl.
Special Olympics...

13:41.702 --> 13:43.118
Oh, no, it's a 5K.

13:43.118 --> 13:46.868
You gotta be kiddin' me.

13:46.868 --> 13:49.285
( starts car,
revs engine )

13:55.076 --> 13:56.410
Gamin:
We saw the charges,

13:56.410 --> 13:58.577
but was that one victim
or two victims?

13:58.577 --> 14:00.159
Okay, just tell me this:

14:00.159 --> 14:01.577
when's the guy
gonna get arrested?

14:01.577 --> 14:03.410
Isn't he considered
a flight risk?

14:03.410 --> 14:06.243
John says there may be
somebody else named
in the indictment.

14:06.243 --> 14:09.535
Jessie-- Jessie, is someone
other than Jerry Sandusky

14:09.535 --> 14:12.243
named in the indictment?
Jessie?

14:12.243 --> 14:14.660
Hey, it's Charlie Thompson
at The Patriot-News, for Bill.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.326
No, I can wait.

14:16.326 --> 14:17.743
Newhouse: Somebody needs
to call Graham Spanier!

14:17.743 --> 14:19.118
I'll do it.

14:19.118 --> 14:20.285
What'd he say about
your first article?

14:20.285 --> 14:21.909
Nothing.
Him and everybody else.

14:21.909 --> 14:23.909
Six months went by.
It was like I wrote
about a yard sale.

14:23.909 --> 14:25.868
Ask Spanier
if he thinks he's
gonna get fired.

14:25.868 --> 14:28.243
They're not gonna fire
the president of Penn State.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.743
Jerry hasn't worked there
in a decade.

14:30.743 --> 14:33.118
Thompson:
Bill, when are we gonna see
this grand jury presentment?

14:33.118 --> 14:35.743
You're either
charging the guy
or you're not.

14:35.743 --> 14:37.159
Newhouse: Sara...

14:37.159 --> 14:39.118
it's up.

14:56.618 --> 14:58.285
Woman: Aaron...

14:58.285 --> 15:00.118
I don't want you to read it.

15:00.118 --> 15:01.577
Aaron.

15:01.577 --> 15:03.410
Everything's on there.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.951
It's not gonna
change anything--

15:04.951 --> 15:08.118
You said I didn't
have to tell you.

15:08.118 --> 15:10.076
With the grand jury
and the cops...

15:10.076 --> 15:12.660
It's on the computer, Aaron.

15:12.660 --> 15:15.785
Your mother can't be
the only person in the country
not to read it.

15:22.868 --> 15:27.993
Newhouse: Looks like Victim One
was 11 when it started.

15:27.993 --> 15:32.201
Sandusky performed oral sex
on him more than 20 times.

15:32.201 --> 15:36.993
Sandusky also had Victim One
perform oral sex on him
one time.

15:36.993 --> 15:40.535
Jesus-- uh,
touched Victim One's penis
with his hands.

15:40.535 --> 15:43.201
Victim One did not want
to engage in sexual conduct

15:43.201 --> 15:45.243
with Sandusky,
knew it was wrong.

15:45.243 --> 15:46.868
And Victim Two?

15:46.868 --> 15:50.951
Uh... ten years old.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.201
Anal intercourse.

15:53.201 --> 15:55.076
- Shit.

15:57.827 --> 16:00.702
Dawn?
: Hi.

16:02.993 --> 16:04.868
Ganim:
I'm gonna be in your area

16:04.868 --> 16:06.201
in a couple hours.

16:06.201 --> 16:07.201
Should I stop by?

16:09.993 --> 16:11.785
I don't know.

16:11.785 --> 16:13.410
Okay, well,
how about I head that way,

16:13.410 --> 16:15.034
and then if it doesn't
feel right, you can just--

16:15.034 --> 16:16.951
you can send me back.

16:20.702 --> 16:22.243
Dawn?

16:27.201 --> 16:28.076
Dawn?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.660
Victim One's mom.

16:35.660 --> 16:37.076
Call me from the car.

16:37.076 --> 16:38.410
We'll finish the piece
while you drive.

16:40.285 --> 16:41.868
Ganim:
The indictment alleges

16:41.868 --> 16:43.702
that former Penn State coach
Jerry Sandusky

16:43.702 --> 16:47.243
used The Second Mile,
the charity he founded in 1977,

16:47.243 --> 16:49.493
- to get access to
and molest boys...
- Okay.

16:49.493 --> 16:52.577
many of whom were vulnerable
due to their social situations.

16:52.577 --> 16:53.951
Newhouse:
That's great.

16:53.951 --> 16:55.118
Ganim:
Many of the alleged incidents

16:55.118 --> 16:56.743
happened in the Lasch building,

16:56.743 --> 16:58.993
the football building
on Penn State campus.

16:58.993 --> 17:01.909
Man:
With football season
well underway now,

17:01.909 --> 17:04.577
for many fans,
it doesn't get any bigger
than Penn State.

17:04.577 --> 17:08.909
But the case against one of
that team's long-time coaches
is unfolding, and quickly.

17:08.909 --> 17:12.492
Charged with abusing
several boys at a program
he'd started,

17:12.492 --> 17:14.951
former coach Jerry Sandusky,
once heir apparent

17:14.951 --> 17:16.617
to the legendary Joe Paterno,

17:16.617 --> 17:19.410
is charged with sexually
abusing eight boys.

17:19.410 --> 17:21.660
And now two high-ranking
university officials,

17:21.660 --> 17:23.992
the athletic director
and a vice president,

17:23.992 --> 17:27.159
face charges in court, accused
of looking the other way

17:27.159 --> 17:29.618
after several mothers
came forward.

17:29.618 --> 17:31.410
One mother told reporter
Sara Ganim

17:31.410 --> 17:33.243
she feels betrayed
by Penn State,

17:33.243 --> 17:36.909
as details emerge
of what she sees as a cover-up,

17:36.909 --> 17:39.951
saying one of her sons
complained about Sandusky,

17:39.951 --> 17:41.326
but no one listened.

17:42.868 --> 17:45.577
"Penn State forever,
molder of men"--

17:45.577 --> 17:47.951
well, where
is that integrity now?

17:47.951 --> 17:49.618
Woman:
If these allegations are true,

17:49.618 --> 17:51.076
then this goes to the very top

17:51.076 --> 17:53.118
of the athletic department
at Penn State,

17:53.118 --> 17:55.326
and one would have
to think that there

17:55.326 --> 17:57.618
would have to be
some kind of housecleaning.

18:05.577 --> 18:08.285
Announcer:
They do go conservative--
is he gonna make it pay off?

18:08.285 --> 18:11.993
I can't-- I can't believe it,
ya know? And then on top of it,

18:11.993 --> 18:14.743
they-- they indicted
Tim and Gary too.

18:14.743 --> 18:16.076
- For what.

18:16.076 --> 18:18.368
For perjury, for lying
to the grand jury.

18:18.368 --> 18:20.326
For failing
to protect children.

18:20.326 --> 18:22.702
They testified in front
of the grand jury
just like you did, Dad.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.326
Scott:
You read it, right?

18:24.326 --> 18:25.951
You read the grand jury
presentment?

18:25.951 --> 18:29.034
No. They indict me?

18:30.993 --> 18:32.285
No.

18:32.285 --> 18:33.535
So?

18:33.535 --> 18:36.243
Wait, are you--
Okay.

18:36.243 --> 18:39.285
I am going to print
this thing out
so you will read it.

18:39.285 --> 18:43.118
I got Nebraska
a week from today.

18:43.118 --> 18:46.868
They're seven-and-one,
just so you know.

18:49.368 --> 18:50.909
Spanier.

18:50.909 --> 18:53.159
Ohh. Put me
in the ground.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.034
Scott: Hey.

18:56.034 --> 18:57.909
Hey, Scott.

18:57.909 --> 18:59.451
Got something I want
to run by your dad.

18:59.451 --> 19:01.868
Yeah, come on in.
He's watching Nebraska.

19:03.493 --> 19:04.702
How do they look?

19:04.702 --> 19:05.702
Paterno:
Good is how they look.

19:07.326 --> 19:08.618
Northwestern's up by four,

19:08.618 --> 19:10.577
but they're not
gonna hold it.

19:15.660 --> 19:17.368
All right.

19:17.368 --> 19:20.285
"The allegations
about a former coach
are troubling,

19:20.285 --> 19:23.118
and it is appropriate
that they be investigated
thoroughly.

19:23.118 --> 19:25.451
With regard
to the other indictments,

19:25.451 --> 19:27.785
I wish to say that
Tim Curley and Gary Schultz

19:27.785 --> 19:29.827
have my unconditional support.

19:29.827 --> 19:31.577
I have complete confidence
in how they have handled

19:31.577 --> 19:35.410
the allegations
about a former
university employee.

19:35.410 --> 19:39.909
I am confident the record
will show that these charges
are groundless,

19:39.909 --> 19:43.702
and that they conducted
themselves professionally
and appropriately."

19:43.702 --> 19:47.909
Why do you say that...
about Gary and Tim?

19:49.243 --> 19:50.493
'Cause it's true.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.702
Grand jury doesn't think so.

19:52.702 --> 19:54.410
You think
that's right?

19:54.410 --> 19:56.410
Well, what do I know?

19:56.410 --> 19:57.660
But I wouldn't go stand

19:57.660 --> 20:00.159
in front of the bull
waving a flag.

20:00.159 --> 20:04.660
This school should look
like we give a hoot,
you know?

20:04.660 --> 20:06.368
We want everything
run down

20:06.368 --> 20:08.493
until we know
what actually happened.

20:08.493 --> 20:10.909
That's a huge slap in the face
to Gary and Tim.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.577
They were...
protecting the school.

20:13.577 --> 20:14.951
Do what you want.

20:14.951 --> 20:17.493
You're asking me,
I'm sayin'.

20:17.493 --> 20:19.034
I think it's
a stupid thing to say.

20:19.034 --> 20:22.451
Well, I'll look at it again.

20:24.993 --> 20:28.201
OK. You need anything,
give me a call.

20:30.076 --> 20:31.493
Hey.

20:31.493 --> 20:33.577
- Spanier: Hey, Jay.

20:33.577 --> 20:34.993
We're just bending
your dad's ear.

20:34.993 --> 20:37.577
Latet anguis in herba.

20:37.577 --> 20:39.285
What does that mean?

20:39.285 --> 20:41.243
It's Virgil.
It means you're
gonna be fine.

20:41.243 --> 20:44.868
Northwestern's up by four.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.451
- That's not gonna last.
- Yeah.

20:46.451 --> 20:48.326
Thanks for stopping by,
Graham.

20:48.326 --> 20:49.285
Spanier:
See you soon.

20:51.118 --> 20:52.868
Oh boy.

20:53.993 --> 20:55.076
What was that?

20:55.076 --> 20:57.493
Box of rocks.

20:57.493 --> 20:59.493
He wants to be
everybody's friend.

20:59.493 --> 21:01.451
He's gonna
get himself fired. Watch.

21:01.451 --> 21:03.702
Couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

21:03.702 --> 21:06.909
There's peppers
and provolone on the stove.
Heat it up.

21:06.909 --> 21:10.159
- Yeah, I talked to Guido.
- Yeah.

21:10.159 --> 21:13.743
He thinks
this is gonna be more
than just a sports story.

21:13.743 --> 21:16.034
Scott: You think?
Did you read it?

21:16.034 --> 21:17.660
The presentment? No.
I just got here.

21:17.660 --> 21:18.827
Yeah.
What's the hurry?

21:18.827 --> 21:20.285
The guy only fucked
eight children.

21:20.285 --> 21:22.034
- Hey, hey.

21:22.034 --> 21:24.993
Just somebody
other than me has
to read this thing.

21:27.743 --> 21:30.743
Can you take this
someplace else, guys?!

21:30.743 --> 21:34.076
I'm trying to work here.
Anybody care?

21:34.076 --> 21:37.159
You got your own homes now,
ya know.

21:37.159 --> 21:40.868
Man: Well, what goes on in
major college sports programs

21:40.868 --> 21:42.618
are they become
little fiefdoms,

21:42.618 --> 21:44.702
and the college coach
becomes all-powerful,

21:44.702 --> 21:47.951
and Joe Paterno is like a god
on that campus.

21:47.951 --> 21:50.785
Man #2:
He's the leader. I understand
there's a university president,

21:50.785 --> 21:54.368
there's a athletic director,
but we know who's running
Penn State.

21:54.368 --> 21:55.535
It's JoePa.

21:55.535 --> 21:57.285
Phone: Mailbox. One.

21:57.285 --> 21:59.493
You have
one new message.

21:59.493 --> 22:03.827
Sara, it's Dawn.
Can we... I'm--I'm sorry.

22:03.827 --> 22:05.743
Let's do this tomorrow.

22:05.743 --> 22:10.951
We're pretty wrung out
over here. Aaron's, um...

22:10.951 --> 22:15.410
Why don't you come by
in the morning. Okay? Thanks.

22:15.410 --> 22:17.410
( "Scarlet Begonias"
by Grateful Dead playing )

22:23.909 --> 22:25.909
Hey! Did you
just get here?

22:25.909 --> 22:26.909
Yeah.

22:26.909 --> 22:29.368
Liam, Mindy. Sara.
She graduated.

22:29.368 --> 22:32.118
- She's gonna
crash here a few nights.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.410
She's the one that got
Sandusky arrested.

22:33.410 --> 22:34.993
You did?

22:34.993 --> 22:36.951
No. No, no.
I-- I didn't.

22:36.951 --> 22:39.201
He's fucking disgusting.
It's sick.

22:39.201 --> 22:43.243
Wait, she's, um,
she's the cub reporter, right?

22:43.243 --> 22:44.785
Does anybody
call you Cubby?

22:44.785 --> 22:47.034
Uh, no.

22:53.076 --> 22:57.451
Man: For 67-year-old
Jerry Sandusky, a jubilant
career at Penn State

22:57.451 --> 23:00.660
has dwindled to a perp walk
and prosecution.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.785
A Penn State graduate
team assistant

23:02.785 --> 23:06.451
allegedly witnessed
a 2002 rape by Sandusky,

23:06.451 --> 23:09.410
involving a ten-year-old boy
in a shower

23:09.410 --> 23:11.285
at Penn State's football
facility.

23:11.285 --> 23:13.451
The assistant told
Coach Paterno about it,

23:13.451 --> 23:17.285
and Paterno is said to have
told Athletic director
Tim Curley,

23:17.285 --> 23:20.618
and university official
Gary Schultz.

23:25.951 --> 23:27.493
Hi, I'm Sara Ganim,

23:27.493 --> 23:29.034
and I work
with the Harrisburg
Patriot-News.

23:29.034 --> 23:30.785
I was wondering
if I'd be able to ask--

23:30.785 --> 23:33.034
No. I'm not talking
to anybody. Thank you.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.493
You're Gary Schultz' assistant.

23:34.493 --> 23:36.993
- Get off the property!

23:36.993 --> 23:39.285
- OK. I just wanted to--
- Get off the property!

23:39.285 --> 23:41.618
- Okay, I'm getting off.
- Not fast enough!

23:41.618 --> 23:43.743
OK! Fuck.

23:43.743 --> 23:45.618
- Newhouse: Hey. So, uh,

23:45.618 --> 23:47.827
after two days
of complete and utter silence,

23:47.827 --> 23:50.493
the national news finally
noticed we published a story.

23:50.493 --> 23:51.993
You got time to talk to CNN?

23:51.993 --> 23:53.702
Yeah, I just
need a minute.

23:53.702 --> 23:56.201
I've got somebody
who's really... excited.

23:56.201 --> 24:00.243
Man: How dare you
to disturb my wife like that!

24:00.243 --> 24:02.577
Woman:
The Pennsylvania
attorney general

24:02.577 --> 24:04.368
says that coach Paterno

24:04.368 --> 24:07.076
is facing no criminal charges
because he followed the law

24:07.076 --> 24:10.493
by quickly telling what he knew
to his superiors.

24:10.493 --> 24:14.868
What she didn't say was if
he had a moral obligation
to do more.

24:14.868 --> 24:17.243
Scott: Steve Garban's
pretending he's not home.

24:17.243 --> 24:20.868
Mary: No one from the board
of trustees will answer
our call.

24:20.868 --> 24:22.535
Guido:
Mother of Christ.

24:22.535 --> 24:23.702
Put out a damn statement

24:23.702 --> 24:25.368
so we can be through
with this already.

24:25.368 --> 24:26.702
We should have
done it six months ago

24:26.702 --> 24:28.201
when it first
came out in the paper.

24:28.201 --> 24:29.951
People need
to hear from you.

24:29.951 --> 24:32.034
This is not
a smart move, Guido.

24:32.034 --> 24:35.159
- I'm not a judge, but...
- OK.

24:35.159 --> 24:37.909
It's-- there's a legal process
happening here.

24:37.909 --> 24:40.368
OK. All right.
A legal process
happening here.

24:40.368 --> 24:42.827
- So...
- 'K. Legal process.

24:50.243 --> 24:51.702
Oh, my God...

24:51.702 --> 24:54.326
Oh--

24:56.076 --> 24:56.909
Ma?

24:58.368 --> 25:00.660
Mary:
Mommy?

25:00.660 --> 25:01.577
What's wrong?

25:07.410 --> 25:10.076
- It's shocking,
if it's true...

25:10.076 --> 25:12.909
- We're deeply saddened...

25:12.909 --> 25:16.743
When I heard what I heard,
I reported it right way...

25:16.743 --> 25:18.618
- Uh...

25:18.618 --> 25:19.909
Tim and Gary.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.618
He did what he was
supposed to do.

25:21.618 --> 25:23.743
- Right. In 2001.

25:27.410 --> 25:30.034
Right, and you should say
what McQueary told you, right?

25:30.034 --> 25:32.909
Guido:
"An assistant coach
informed me that--"

25:32.909 --> 25:36.034
An assistant coach
informed me what?

25:36.034 --> 25:39.285
McQueary couldn't put his--
a sentence together.

25:39.285 --> 25:42.243
He couldn't catch his breath.
He was all over the place.

25:42.243 --> 25:46.451
So, he told you
that they were having sex?

25:46.451 --> 25:47.785
No, he didn't--

25:47.785 --> 25:49.827
He didn't know
what he saw. Come on.

25:49.827 --> 25:51.951
They were touching maybe.
Who knows?

25:51.951 --> 25:54.577
All I know is
what he saw upset him.

25:54.577 --> 25:55.868
That's-- That's-- That's--

25:55.868 --> 25:58.951
He -- He was--
He was, uh, rattled.

25:58.951 --> 26:00.577
Ya know? Something happened.

26:00.577 --> 26:03.827
But, so why does
the presentment
say anal rape?

26:06.410 --> 26:09.118
- It says anal sex.
- Oh, well, you're the lawyer.

26:09.118 --> 26:12.577
Mary: There's no such thing
as consensual anal
with a ten-year old....

26:18.034 --> 26:21.909
He was distraught!
He was, he was--
He didn't make sense!

26:21.909 --> 26:25.951
It was clear whatever
he was talking about
was inappropriate.

26:25.951 --> 26:27.159
I-- I got that.

26:27.159 --> 26:31.827
So, I called Tim,
and I called, uh, Gary.

26:31.827 --> 26:35.034
And, uh, and, uh--
and if it's true,

26:35.034 --> 26:38.868
I get everybody's upset.
We're upset.

26:38.868 --> 26:41.493
But meanwhile, you gotta--
you gotta let,

26:41.493 --> 26:44.076
uh, legal process unfold--

26:44.076 --> 26:46.410
Scott:
Dad, did you know

26:46.410 --> 26:50.118
anything else
about, uh, Jerry?

26:50.118 --> 26:52.326
What do you mean?
Why are you saying that?

26:52.326 --> 26:54.827
- I just told you.
- I don't know, but--

26:54.827 --> 26:57.076
- When you read it,
you can see

26:57.076 --> 26:58.827
the guy had a clear problem.
Ya know? Maybe--

26:58.827 --> 27:00.368
I didn't read the thing.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.034
You told me about the thing...
Scott,

27:03.034 --> 27:04.535
and then you told me again.

27:04.535 --> 27:06.660
- I know. I'm just saying--
- So I know.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.368
So, you're badgering me.

27:08.368 --> 27:09.868
You're badgering me,
I don't like it.

27:09.868 --> 27:11.451
I got a game to prepare for.

27:11.451 --> 27:14.076
That's what's important
to me now, Scott.

27:14.076 --> 27:15.410
Whatever these things are--

27:15.410 --> 27:18.034
People think
that you knew
about all of it.

27:18.034 --> 27:21.285
- But I don't care
what people think!
- 2001. 1998.

27:21.285 --> 27:23.410
"Well, JoePa runs the school.
How could he not know?"

27:23.410 --> 27:25.577
Well, I didn't know.
I don't know what they're
talking about.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.868
I didn't know--
What-- What am I,
omniscient here?

27:27.868 --> 27:29.993
Well, yeah, that's what
they think you are,

27:29.993 --> 27:31.785
- and they're writing stories.

27:31.785 --> 27:33.535
"There's something funny
about this Jerry guy."

27:33.535 --> 27:34.702
Nothing like that?

27:34.702 --> 27:36.076
What happened to you?

27:36.076 --> 27:38.535
You're telling me
about a rumor?

27:38.535 --> 27:39.827
A rumor?

27:39.827 --> 27:41.034
What's that?

27:41.034 --> 27:42.951
Is that why I sent you
to law school?

27:42.951 --> 27:45.410
Gossip like that,
what it does to people?

27:45.410 --> 27:49.076
You have any idea--
What about your Uncle George?

27:49.076 --> 27:51.827
Huh? How come he wasn't married.

27:51.827 --> 27:54.451
Everybody said,
"Something's wrong with him.

27:54.451 --> 27:56.785
Whatever this is,
I don't understand it.

27:58.827 --> 28:00.577
It's garbage!

28:00.577 --> 28:03.285
Jerry Sandusky.
What is he?

28:03.285 --> 28:08.451
I thought he was--
he was unfocused
and such a pain in the butt,

28:08.451 --> 28:12.243
but yes, uh, kids were--

28:12.243 --> 28:14.577
he had kids around all the time.

28:14.577 --> 28:18.410
These were hopeless,
helpless, lost causes.

28:18.410 --> 28:21.285
He started the biggest charity
in the history of this state.

28:21.285 --> 28:25.159
Every heavy hitter,
every high roller
donating every week,

28:25.159 --> 28:27.951
checks coming in by the dozens.

28:27.951 --> 28:29.785
I never saw anything like it.

28:29.785 --> 28:33.951
He's honored by the president
of the United States.

28:37.785 --> 28:39.285
I got a statement.

28:41.660 --> 28:47.702
Sue and I...
have devoted our whole lives
to helping young people.

28:47.702 --> 28:51.618
The fact that someone
we thought we knew

28:51.618 --> 28:54.785
might have harmed young people
like this,

28:54.785 --> 28:57.868
if it's true...

28:57.868 --> 29:02.993
well, we were fooled...
along with a whole bunch
of professionals

29:02.993 --> 29:06.159
who are trained
in this kind of thing.

29:07.993 --> 29:09.368
And we're sorry.

29:12.660 --> 29:15.618
We are grieving...

29:15.618 --> 29:17.368
for all of them.

29:21.201 --> 29:24.368
We'll release that.

29:24.368 --> 29:26.285
That's the end of it.

29:26.285 --> 29:27.868
I have practice.

29:55.118 --> 29:56.577
Man:
Here to say a few words

29:56.577 --> 29:59.243
about our guest of honor
Jerry Sandusky

29:59.243 --> 30:00.827
is his long-time colleague,

30:00.827 --> 30:03.410
mentor and friend
of over 30 years,

30:03.410 --> 30:08.743
head coach of Penn State
Nittany Lions, Joe Paterno.

30:13.326 --> 30:14.868
Paterno:
Jerry and Dottie,

30:14.868 --> 30:17.535
they always had kids,
they adopted kids,

30:17.535 --> 30:19.076
they-- they fostered children--

30:19.076 --> 30:21.326
all the time,
everywhere I look,

30:21.326 --> 30:23.285
there was kids, kids--
kids kept appearing.

30:23.285 --> 30:25.201
I didn't know what
was goin' on.

30:25.201 --> 30:26.702
I said, "What are they doing?"

30:26.702 --> 30:29.410
I mean, I thought
they were their kids, right?

30:29.410 --> 30:31.909
Little did I know,
it turns out,

30:31.909 --> 30:35.201
Uh, Jerry started this,
uh, charity.

30:37.868 --> 30:42.076
This wonderful thing, ya know?
All these kids, uh--

30:42.076 --> 30:47.201
I had no idea. I had no idea...

30:47.201 --> 30:49.410
I had no idea.

30:49.410 --> 30:53.909
All these kids, all these kids,
all these kids...

30:53.909 --> 30:55.743
Hundreds, hundreds of children.

30:55.743 --> 30:58.493
-Thousands.
- Thousands!

30:58.493 --> 31:00.368
Thousands! Thousands!

31:00.368 --> 31:03.159
- That's awesome.

31:17.285 --> 31:21.451
Coach:
OK, so we'll start with Matt.
He's working out a little bit.

31:21.451 --> 31:23.577
Coach 2:
Watch his knee.

31:23.577 --> 31:24.785
You've gotta
be kiddin' me.

31:24.785 --> 31:26.285
These guys are
fucking animals.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.785
Coach 2: All right,
come on, guys.

31:27.785 --> 31:29.785
Closed practice.
Let's go outside, come on!

31:29.785 --> 31:32.743
JoePa's gonna give
his regularly scheduled
press conference tomorrow.

31:32.743 --> 31:34.368
Is this where
the locker room was
where the indicents took place?

31:34.368 --> 31:36.159
Could we just
get a couple shots--

31:36.159 --> 31:37.909
Good day to you, sir.
All right, come on.

31:37.909 --> 31:39.618
Outside. Outside, please.

31:39.618 --> 31:42.076
Tom, could we get a lockdown
on the last building, please?

31:44.326 --> 31:47.285
Man: I have no idea
why Mike McQueary is still
on this staff.

31:47.285 --> 31:49.493
He was a 28-year-old man,

31:49.493 --> 31:53.827
and he saw an older man
commit a sexual act
against a ten-year-old,

31:53.827 --> 31:55.368
and did nothing about it.

31:55.368 --> 31:56.785
He walked away,
and went home,

31:56.785 --> 31:58.493
and talked
to his dad about it.

31:58.493 --> 32:00.868
And then decided to see
Joe Paterno the next day.

32:00.868 --> 32:03.702
- All right, guys,
let's go! Ladder!

32:20.618 --> 32:22.410
- Shh!

32:22.410 --> 32:24.159
Are you Sara Ganim?

32:24.159 --> 32:27.326
I'm Hugh Lewison, with NBC.
Do you have a second?

32:27.326 --> 32:29.827
Oh, uh, I don't.
I'm sorry.

32:29.827 --> 32:32.410
I got, I got--
I got, uh, places to go.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.577
Just two seconds.
I just need a couple
of phone numbers.

32:34.577 --> 32:35.993
- Oh, yeah, no.

32:35.993 --> 32:37.285
I have a piece
that's got to run

32:37.285 --> 32:39.118
in, like, ten minutes,

32:39.118 --> 32:40.868
so I got to get
to my interview.

32:40.868 --> 32:42.827
Who are you
interviewing?

32:42.827 --> 32:45.326
Um, I'm sorry.

32:45.326 --> 32:47.326
Look, I just drove
four hours to find you.

32:47.326 --> 32:50.577
You're the only goddamn person
who's followed this thing.

32:50.577 --> 32:53.076
Can you tell me why I can't
find a police report from when

32:53.076 --> 32:56.451
McQueary reported
Sandusky in the shower
with the kid in 2001?

32:56.451 --> 32:58.868
I know, it's a real
head-scratcher.

32:58.868 --> 33:01.118
Do you have it?
You don't have to
show it to me.

33:01.118 --> 33:02.159
Just tell me if you've seen it.

33:02.159 --> 33:03.326
Read the article I wrote.

33:03.326 --> 33:04.909
There's no police report
from 2001.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.743
Man: But the indictment says
there was an investigation.

33:09.076 --> 33:13.118
No? Can you just nod
or shake your head?

33:13.118 --> 33:15.660
I'm being followed
by this guy from NBC.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.326
40 news organizations
want to interview you.

33:18.326 --> 33:20.785
- He's still following me.

33:20.785 --> 33:22.410
To interview the mom.

33:22.410 --> 33:24.618
You better lose him.
Keep him away from the mom.

33:24.618 --> 33:27.034
This is not
Starksy and Hutch, David.

33:27.034 --> 33:28.743
Go away!

33:34.577 --> 33:35.410
Thank you.

33:41.076 --> 33:42.577
- Oh, hey.

33:42.577 --> 33:44.618
- Yeah. Fine.

33:44.618 --> 33:46.410
They're, uh, gonna
bring me in today,

33:46.410 --> 33:47.618
but I don't think
they're gonna keep me.

33:47.618 --> 33:48.868
To jail?

33:48.868 --> 33:50.868
Oh, God, Gar.

33:50.868 --> 33:54.118
- Everything's
gonna be fine, Kim.

33:54.118 --> 33:57.034
Hey, uh, listen, Kim.
Could you do me a favor?

33:57.034 --> 33:58.243
Anything.

33:58.243 --> 33:59.785
Go into my office...

33:59.785 --> 34:00.618
OK.

34:01.909 --> 34:02.951
...to the desk.

34:02.951 --> 34:04.201
Yeah?

34:04.201 --> 34:05.827
Unlock the bottom drawer.

34:08.076 --> 34:09.201
Mm

34:09.201 --> 34:11.118
You see the transition file?

34:11.118 --> 34:12.868
Yep.

34:12.868 --> 34:15.118
Yeah, could you bring that
to the house?

34:15.118 --> 34:18.493
Of course. Anything else?
You want some food?

34:18.493 --> 34:20.201
No, no, no, no, no. I'm good.

34:20.201 --> 34:24.409
Okay, Gar. Call me
if there's anything at all.

34:24.409 --> 34:26.076
Yeah, yeah. Will do. Bye.

34:45.868 --> 34:49.702
No, no, no!
Don't hit yourself.
Hit him!

34:54.993 --> 34:55.993
Player: Set!

34:58.368 --> 35:01.493
- They're gonna move us.

35:01.493 --> 35:02.993
Dawn:
It's not safe.

35:02.993 --> 35:05.451
Since it came out,
people know who he is.

35:11.535 --> 35:13.201
Uh, you don't have to, uh--

35:13.201 --> 35:14.785
Aaron sleeps
on the couch
every night.

35:14.785 --> 35:17.827
Can't sleep in a bed
since Jerry's--

35:19.743 --> 35:22.076
Dawn: I don't know what
you need to ask anymore

35:22.076 --> 35:25.493
It's all on the thing online.

35:27.034 --> 35:30.201
He didn't want me
to read it, but...

35:36.326 --> 35:38.868
Ganim: Was there anything
that surprised you?

35:38.868 --> 35:41.034
I-- I didn't want her to know
the parts with, like--

35:41.034 --> 35:43.743
I was never in the room
when he told the whole thing.

35:43.743 --> 35:45.493
Not even at the grand juries.

35:45.493 --> 35:47.660
I wanted to.

35:47.660 --> 35:52.410
I mean...
it was so hard for him.

35:52.410 --> 35:54.034
He fainted, threw up--

35:54.034 --> 35:55.034
Mom.

35:55.034 --> 35:57.535
He says testifying was--

35:57.535 --> 35:58.743
Can I say?

36:01.535 --> 36:03.201
He says the grand jury
testimonies

36:03.201 --> 36:07.410
were the worst things
he's ever had to do
in his life.

36:07.410 --> 36:08.285
Other than...

36:18.702 --> 36:20.326
I am sorry you have
to talk about this again--

36:20.326 --> 36:21.909
It's bullshit, okay?

36:24.493 --> 36:26.702
Jerry's already out.

36:26.702 --> 36:29.993
The judge was a volunteer
at the Second Mile.
Sent him home.

36:29.993 --> 36:31.118
Unsecured bail.

36:34.660 --> 36:37.034
It's been three years.

36:37.034 --> 36:38.827
From the first day,
it's the same thing--

36:38.827 --> 36:41.285
- Shit. I'm sorry.

36:41.285 --> 36:45.285
Let me just try
and silence this thing.

36:45.285 --> 36:48.702
Um, what were you saying?
The, uh, first three--

36:48.702 --> 36:49.951
It's been three years?

36:54.159 --> 36:57.951
We reported it at the school
as soon as he said somethin'.

36:57.951 --> 37:01.618
We went to the principal,
Karen Probst.

37:01.618 --> 37:04.827
Write her name down.
Fucking bitch.

37:04.827 --> 37:09.618
You know what she said?
She told me, when I said,

37:09.618 --> 37:12.785
"Call the police,
that man touched my kid,"

37:12.785 --> 37:16.034
she said, "I think you should
go home and sleep on it,

37:16.034 --> 37:19.702
because I'm not sure this
is something you wanna do.

37:19.702 --> 37:22.660
You're very emotional."

37:22.660 --> 37:25.702
She put in
a cover-your-ass call

37:25.702 --> 37:28.993
to Child Services once
we were already there.

37:28.993 --> 37:30.660
If we hadn't raised hell,

37:30.660 --> 37:33.493
she would have pretended
the whole thing never happened.

37:33.493 --> 37:37.660
Oh, that Jerry--
he's got a heart of gold.

37:37.660 --> 37:41.034
Everybody loves him.

37:41.034 --> 37:43.368
He's not going to jail.

37:43.368 --> 37:45.285
I'm just gonna be another kid
on the front page

37:45.285 --> 37:47.993
in the newspaper
with a big "liar"
stamped across his head.

37:47.993 --> 37:51.660
Ganim: Look, I don't know how
this case is gonna turn out,

37:51.660 --> 37:53.868
but I can tell you
that right now
people look at you

37:53.868 --> 37:56.243
as the first person that's had
the courage to come forward

37:56.243 --> 37:59.868
and stand up to a really
intimidating public figure.

37:59.868 --> 38:02.201
And because
of what you did,

38:02.201 --> 38:04.743
now five other guys have had
the courage to come forward

38:04.743 --> 38:06.909
and do the same thing.

38:06.909 --> 38:10.201
There's no grand jury
investigation without you.

38:10.201 --> 38:12.076
You started this whole thing.

38:14.201 --> 38:15.577
And if you didn't
say anything,

38:15.577 --> 38:17.201
Jerry would still be
hanging out

38:17.201 --> 38:19.285
at Second Mile
with a bunch of kids,

38:19.285 --> 38:20.909
trying to pick his favorite.

38:31.368 --> 38:34.535
Bobby, go find Kate.
Go! She's at dance.

38:37.368 --> 38:38.577
That's Aaron's brother.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.243
He's ten.

38:40.243 --> 38:41.993
Yeah, that's how old
I was when--

38:54.076 --> 38:56.451
So, uh...

38:56.451 --> 38:59.326
just keep it
to football tomorrow...

38:59.326 --> 39:00.827
at the press conference.

39:00.827 --> 39:01.743
Yeah, I know.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.326
Did you read it?

39:06.326 --> 39:08.326
No, I didn't
read it yet, Jay.

39:08.326 --> 39:09.951
I didn't--
How am I gonna
read it?

39:11.243 --> 39:12.909
After Nebraska,
I haven't--

39:12.909 --> 39:14.410
I haven't
had the time.

39:16.076 --> 39:17.827
You know,
Scott gets worked up.

39:17.827 --> 39:19.702
Your mother gets worked up.

39:19.702 --> 39:23.076
That's not my job.
Understand?

39:23.076 --> 39:23.951
Or your job.

39:26.159 --> 39:28.118
We don't get worked up.

39:28.118 --> 39:31.618
You get hysterical
every time your team
gets attacked,

39:31.618 --> 39:33.326
that's a short career.

39:37.201 --> 39:39.951
Man:
Ya have to wonder right now
where Joe Paterno's head is.

39:39.951 --> 39:42.785
So much is swirling around him.
And, you know,

39:42.785 --> 39:44.368
maybe there's a little bit
of a disconnect,

39:44.368 --> 39:46.410
maybe he doesn't
fully understand

39:46.410 --> 39:47.951
the gravity of what's going on,
you know, he's talking

39:47.951 --> 39:49.951
about beating Nebraska
on Saturday.

39:51.076 --> 39:52.909
Man:
Good hit, good hit.

40:15.535 --> 40:17.785
Reporter:
Is coach Paterno
under investigation as well?

40:17.785 --> 40:21.285
No, he's not regarded
as a target at this point.

40:21.285 --> 40:22.618
But somebody needs to question

40:22.618 --> 40:25.118
what I believe
is the moral requirements

40:25.118 --> 40:26.868
for a human being that knows

40:26.868 --> 40:29.535
that sexual things
that are happening to a child.

40:29.535 --> 40:31.993
:
No whether you're
a football coach,

40:31.993 --> 40:33.451
or the university president,

40:33.451 --> 40:36.451
or the guy sweeping out
the building,

40:36.451 --> 40:40.660
I feel that you have
a moral obligation
to call us.

40:40.660 --> 40:42.827
Woman:
Commissioner, thank you
so much for being here.

40:42.827 --> 40:45.493
I know you spent 30 years
with the FBI,

40:45.493 --> 40:47.868
you say you have
never seen anything

40:47.868 --> 40:51.118
like the alleged sexual abuse
allegations in this case,

40:51.118 --> 40:56.577
and you say you want to know
why the police were not called.

40:56.577 --> 41:00.702
I don't want to criticize
Joe Paterno or anybody else.

41:00.702 --> 41:03.868
But any human being who has
this kind of information,

41:03.868 --> 41:07.243
or who has knowledge of child
sexual abuse, should call us--

41:07.243 --> 41:09.827
- Sue: Nobody wants to ask

41:09.827 --> 41:11.827
why Mike McQueary
didn't call the police.

41:11.827 --> 41:14.743
I mean, he was
the one who was there.
He's a grown man.

41:14.743 --> 41:16.577
He comes into my kitchen.

41:16.577 --> 41:19.118
Dad went
to who he thought
was  the police.

41:19.118 --> 41:21.577
Ga-- Gary ran
the campus police.

41:21.577 --> 41:22.702
Right, Scotty?

41:22.702 --> 41:24.993
Gary also knew
about that thing in 1998

41:24.993 --> 41:25.993
and did nothing about it.

41:27.034 --> 41:29.285
Wait, what thing in 1998?

41:29.285 --> 41:31.368
Scott:
There was another kid, Ma.

41:31.368 --> 41:33.868
In the shower,
in the Lasch building.

41:33.868 --> 41:36.201
That kid told his mom,
his mom called the cops.

41:36.201 --> 41:37.909
The cops got Jerry
over to the kid's house

41:37.909 --> 41:39.993
while they were
in the other room listening.

41:39.993 --> 41:42.702
W

41:42.702 --> 41:44.368
- Yes.
- Yeah.

41:44.368 --> 41:48.743
And the mom says,
"You can't do this
ever again with anyone,"

41:48.743 --> 41:52.909
and Jerry says,
"I can't promise that"
with the cops listening.

41:52.909 --> 41:54.951
And they don't arrest him.
They just say,

41:54.951 --> 41:56.660
"Don't shower
with little boys."

41:56.660 --> 41:57.702
That was the end of it.

41:57.702 --> 41:59.118
How was that the end of it?

41:59.118 --> 42:01.909
Because all they had
was showering and hugging.

42:01.909 --> 42:02.909
Not a crime.

42:02.909 --> 42:04.743
A hug goodbye?

42:04.743 --> 42:07.201
Mary:
No. Naked, wet hugging.

42:07.201 --> 42:08.993
Sue:
And that's not a crime?

42:08.993 --> 42:14.159
Because the DA,
for some ungodly reason,
decided that it wasn't.

42:14.159 --> 42:19.618
Well, why isn't anyone talking
about the DA's moral obligation?

42:19.618 --> 42:21.702
Did Gary tell you
about that one too?

42:21.702 --> 42:24.201
Guido:
Why do you think the police
commissioner is trying to say

42:24.201 --> 42:26.410
that Joe has got
a moral responsibility?

42:26.410 --> 42:27.743
It's because they missed it.

42:27.743 --> 42:30.118
You know what?
Everybody missed it.
Everybody!

42:30.118 --> 42:31.451
How come no one's talking

42:31.451 --> 42:33.285
about the frickin'
Second Mile, huh?

42:33.285 --> 42:34.951
Those idiots.
They were told
what happened,

42:34.951 --> 42:36.451
and nobody decided to say,

42:36.451 --> 42:37.868
"Hey, maybe we should
keep this guy away

42:37.868 --> 42:38.909
from the hundreds
of little boys

42:38.909 --> 42:39.951
we got running around"?

42:39.951 --> 42:41.577
What was Gary thinking?

42:41.577 --> 42:43.243
Listen to this.

42:43.243 --> 42:45.743
"Schultz, equivocating
on the definition of 'sexua''

42:45.743 --> 42:48.118
in the context
of Sandusky wrestling with

42:48.118 --> 42:50.410
and grabbing the genitals
of the boy--"

42:50.410 --> 42:54.326
I mean, who equivocates
on grabbing a kid's genitals.

42:54.326 --> 42:57.285
Okay, let's go.
Let me have that thing.

43:14.410 --> 43:16.368
- Oh, great. Thank you.
- Of course.

43:16.368 --> 43:17.660
Is there anything else
I can do?

43:17.660 --> 43:18.993
No. No, you better go.

43:18.993 --> 43:20.577
You don't want 'em
getting interested in you.

43:20.577 --> 43:24.909
Yeah, um, I grabbed
another file
in case you need it.

43:24.909 --> 43:27.285
Oh, great. Thanks.

43:27.285 --> 43:28.535
Okay.

44:14.159 --> 44:15.827
An hour shower?

44:15.827 --> 44:19.285
Same as what happened
three years ago in '98.

44:19.285 --> 44:22.702
Why does the man
still have keys
to the building?

44:22.702 --> 44:26.493
It's part
of his retirement deal.

44:26.493 --> 44:30.993
Just tell the man
he can't come in here
with little boys.

44:30.993 --> 44:33.076
Cops told him that
the first time it happened.

44:33.076 --> 44:35.201
Didn't seem to make
much of an impression.

44:35.201 --> 44:39.076
Sit down with the guy
and explain that,

44:39.076 --> 44:42.909
under no circumstances, can he
come into university facilities

44:42.909 --> 44:44.076
with a child.

44:44.076 --> 44:47.493
No workouts.
No goddamn showering.

44:47.493 --> 44:49.951
All right, so we--
we talk to the charity,

44:49.951 --> 44:53.743
we talk to Jerry,
and we call Child Welfare.

44:55.577 --> 44:57.868
And they will file it
with the police?

44:57.868 --> 44:59.368
Yeah.

45:02.326 --> 45:04.618
This is a fucking nightmare.

45:13.785 --> 45:15.451
Man:
Will the court officer now read

45:15.451 --> 45:18.785
the charges
against Gerald A. Sandusky?

45:18.785 --> 45:21.909
Woman:
Sandusky performed oral sex
on Victim One

45:21.909 --> 45:23.868
on a number of occasions,

45:23.868 --> 45:27.285
had Victim One perform
oral sex on him,

45:27.285 --> 45:30.451
gives Nike shoes,
ice hockey equipment...

45:30.451 --> 45:33.451
...overnight at his residence,
basement, bedroom,

45:33.451 --> 45:37.118
performed oral sex on him
more than 20 times.

45:37.118 --> 45:40.618
Victim Four.
Attend the pre-game banquet,

45:40.618 --> 45:43.285
sits with Sandusky
at the coach's table...

45:43.285 --> 45:45.451
hotel room...
the Alamo Bowl...

45:45.451 --> 45:49.159
...Inserts his erect penis
into Victim Four's mouth.

45:49.159 --> 45:52.159
Attempted to penetrate
Victim Four's anus

45:52.159 --> 45:53.909
both with a finger
and his penis.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.493
What is  sodomy?

46:04.493 --> 46:05.951
Scott:
Oh, come on.

46:05.951 --> 46:08.993
Uh, Achilles,
and, uh, Patroclus?

46:10.493 --> 46:12.785
Nessus
and, uh, uh, Uralus.

46:12.785 --> 46:15.118
W-What does he know
about these perverted things?

46:30.201 --> 46:31.993
Joe's having
a press conference today,

46:31.993 --> 46:34.034
so if we could do this
as quick as possible,

46:34.034 --> 46:35.285
I'd like to get over there.

46:35.285 --> 46:38.451
Do you have a hairbrush
or a comb?

46:38.451 --> 46:40.909
- Uh, no. no.

46:40.909 --> 46:43.702
-  Uh, no. No.

46:43.702 --> 46:45.827
Huge bag and you don't
have anything.

46:45.827 --> 46:46.909
- Okay.

46:46.909 --> 46:48.201
Um, what do we think
about this coat?

46:48.201 --> 46:49.702
I think it's gonna strobe.

46:49.702 --> 46:51.577
Yeah. Let's, uh,
let's take it off.

46:51.577 --> 46:53.159
- Mh-hmm.

46:53.159 --> 46:54.451
I've got,
like, a yellow...

46:54.451 --> 46:56.034
yellow shirt on I can wear.

46:56.034 --> 46:58.201
Oh...

46:58.201 --> 47:00.702
Uh, you know what?
Let's keep it on.

47:00.702 --> 47:04.034
- Mh-hmm. Mh-hmm. Button up.

47:04.034 --> 47:05.201
Button up.

47:05.201 --> 47:07.368
Yeah, it's gonna
help you.

47:07.368 --> 47:09.785
Man: Legendary head coach
Joe Paterno getting ready

47:09.785 --> 47:12.326
for what may be the toughest
press conference of his life
today.

47:12.326 --> 47:14.702
Man 2:
These will be his first
on-camera statements

47:14.702 --> 47:18.951
since this scandal broke,
and the stakes are incredibly
high for him.

47:18.951 --> 47:21.660
Guido: Okay, that statement
we put out the other day,
it had no impact.

47:21.660 --> 47:23.868
We do it today,
we do it head on,

47:23.868 --> 47:25.909
on camera, and then it's over.

47:25.909 --> 47:27.493
Joe:
All right, McQueary told me

47:27.493 --> 47:30.076
he saw something
inappropriate,

47:30.076 --> 47:33.159
so the next day I called Tim,

47:33.159 --> 47:34.577
- Wait, wait--
- and he came over.

47:34.577 --> 47:36.118
Scott:
You called him when?

47:36.118 --> 47:38.535
I called him the next day.

47:38.535 --> 47:40.909
It was Saturday. Oh,
it was Saturday, yeah.

47:40.909 --> 47:43.577
I got the call, I waited
till the weekend was over

47:43.577 --> 47:46.702
'cause I, you know,
I wasn't gonna ruin his weekend.

47:46.702 --> 47:49.285
- He's got kids.
- Don't say that.

47:49.285 --> 47:51.285
Scott asked a question.

47:51.285 --> 47:53.243
Well, do you
want me to lie?

47:53.243 --> 47:55.577
You can't say
that you heard
about child abuse,

47:55.577 --> 47:58.951
and then you waited
a couple days so you didn't
ruin someone's weekend.

47:58.951 --> 48:02.034
I mean, presumably the rape
ruined the child's weekend--

48:02.034 --> 48:03.827
- Mary Kay.
- But put it this way:

48:03.827 --> 48:05.743
You hear about someone
diddling my kids?

48:05.743 --> 48:07.326
Don't wait the weekend!

48:07.326 --> 48:10.577
She's right, she's right.
You can't say it, okay?

48:10.577 --> 48:12.451
- OK, this should be football.

48:12.451 --> 48:15.034
Right? It's a weekly
football press conference!

48:15.034 --> 48:17.118
I mean, what are we doing?
We're sittin' around--

48:17.118 --> 48:19.618
They're standing out there.
There's people--

48:19.618 --> 48:21.451
Everybody wants to know
what happened.

48:21.451 --> 48:23.076
That's right. You do it,
and then it's done.

48:23.076 --> 48:25.410
- Right.
- Okay. Sure.

48:25.410 --> 48:29.285
Did you call the police?

48:29.285 --> 48:32.201
But it is a press conference,
Scott. It's not a deposition.

48:32.201 --> 48:34.451
Scott: It's gonna be a lot
worse than a deposition, Dad,
this is the media.

48:34.451 --> 48:35.993
They got nothing
to eat but you.

48:35.993 --> 48:37.660
So the press is going
to ask you

48:37.660 --> 48:39.243
why didn't you
pick up the phone
yourself?

48:39.243 --> 48:43.243
Michael McQueary was a mess
when he talked to me.

48:43.243 --> 48:45.201
Mary Kay:
What did the kid say happened?

48:45.201 --> 48:49.660
I didn't talk to the kids.
I talked to McQueary.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.410
Wait, so--
So who talked
to the kid?

48:52.410 --> 48:53.660
Was it Gary?

48:53.660 --> 48:55.368
I don't know
who talked to the kid.

48:55.368 --> 48:56.660
I don't know.
Who knows?

48:56.660 --> 48:57.660
Was he okay?

48:57.660 --> 49:00.159
- The child.

49:00.159 --> 49:02.326
Guido: I don't think
the press is gonna get
into this, hon.

49:02.326 --> 49:04.201
No, I'm asking, Guido.

49:04.201 --> 49:07.201
I mean, the kid knows
what happened.
What did he say?

49:07.201 --> 49:09.785
Well, I think nobody talked
to the kid.

49:09.785 --> 49:11.285
They-- they didn't find the kid.

49:13.827 --> 49:16.034
I don't-- I don't
understand what the--

49:16.034 --> 49:17.993
How could they not
find the kid?

49:17.993 --> 49:19.660
They could
just ask Jerry.

49:19.660 --> 49:23.577
Well, they didn't look for him.
It was an oversight.

49:23.577 --> 49:26.034
- Wow.
- Oversight.

49:26.034 --> 49:30.410
So did you ask about the kid
and they just never followed up?

49:33.243 --> 49:34.868
Guido:
Mary Kay.

49:38.577 --> 49:40.326
Did you ask?

49:42.868 --> 49:45.368
Man: This is more
than a football legacy.

49:45.368 --> 49:50.076
This is about people,
and if we can't protect
our kids,

49:50.076 --> 49:53.076
we, as a society, are pathetic.

49:53.076 --> 49:55.243
- Gar. It's Kim.
- Hey.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.451
- Yeah.

49:57.451 --> 49:59.326
Good. You okay?

49:59.326 --> 50:01.827
Uh, yeah, super.
Listen, Kim, I really--

50:01.827 --> 50:03.243
I made a copy...

50:03.243 --> 50:07.743
of the file...
in the envelope.

50:07.743 --> 50:10.785
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

50:10.785 --> 50:11.785
It's okay.

50:11.785 --> 50:13.577
It's habit, you know?

50:13.577 --> 50:16.410
I don't take anything
from the file without a copy.

50:16.410 --> 50:18.243
Yeah, of course. Of course.

50:18.243 --> 50:22.909
Um...I gave you
the original, Gar.

50:22.909 --> 50:24.660
I shouldn't have done that.

50:24.660 --> 50:27.243
Oh, it's fine, Kim.

50:27.243 --> 50:28.785
Look, I'll bring 'em back
in the morning.

50:28.785 --> 50:31.951
No, they won't let you
in the building.

50:31.951 --> 50:36.076
I'm concerned
about hiding evidence

50:36.076 --> 50:38.118
if the originals are gone.

50:38.118 --> 50:41.326
There's, like,
fingerprints and things.

50:41.326 --> 50:44.159
They look into all that.

50:44.159 --> 50:46.076
What if they ask me about it?

50:48.451 --> 50:52.951
I don't know, Kim.
Just tell 'em the truth.

50:52.951 --> 50:56.909
Okay. Okay.

50:56.909 --> 50:58.410
Thanks.

51:02.451 --> 51:07.577
Curley :
Look, I met with Joe.
We talked about it, and...

51:07.577 --> 51:09.827
to go behind Jerry's back
to his own organization

51:09.827 --> 51:11.618
and the Department
of Child Welfare

51:11.618 --> 51:13.785
before we've even looked
at the guy face-to-face

51:13.785 --> 51:16.618
and asked him what happened

51:16.618 --> 51:20.118
seems...
I don't know, inhumane.

51:20.118 --> 51:21.951
What happened
to calling Child Welfare?

51:21.951 --> 51:23.785
And, uh, fucking Second Mile?

51:23.785 --> 51:26.660
Look, we just gotta
ask the guy what happened.

51:26.660 --> 51:29.785
I mean, maybe-- I don't know,
maybe it's a misunderstanding.

51:29.785 --> 51:31.868
Graham agrees. Joe agrees.

51:37.326 --> 51:38.702
Who's driving?

51:38.702 --> 51:40.159
Jay: Uh, come in my car.

51:40.159 --> 51:42.451
I'll drop you home
after practice.

51:42.451 --> 51:44.201
Yeah, there's a couple
of reporters out there.

51:44.201 --> 51:46.076
Keep em to the side
so we don't run anybody down.

51:46.076 --> 51:47.493
- Yeah.

51:47.493 --> 51:49.993
Why-- Why aren't they
at the press conference?

51:49.993 --> 51:51.451
Probably wanna follow you there.

51:51.451 --> 51:52.993
Hey, you can moon 'em
on the way.

51:52.993 --> 51:54.827
Scott, that's not
appropriate right now.

51:56.951 --> 51:58.743
Says who?

51:58.743 --> 52:03.326
Guys, they don't want
to do it right now.
The press conference.

52:03.326 --> 52:05.285
We got practice
in 40 minutes.
It's now or never.

52:05.285 --> 52:07.410
Yeah, well,
they don't want
a press conference today.

52:07.410 --> 52:09.535
It's cancelled.

52:09.535 --> 52:12.243
Without my permission?

52:12.243 --> 52:14.285
Guido: Yeah.

52:14.285 --> 52:17.076
Man:
Due to the ongoing
legal circumstances

52:17.076 --> 52:19.785
surrendered around the recent
allegations and charges,

52:19.785 --> 52:22.034
we have determined
that today's press conference

52:22.034 --> 52:24.326
cannot be held
and will not be rescheduled.

52:24.326 --> 52:26.618
We will not have
any additional comments
on this matter.

52:26.618 --> 52:28.993
Woman: Never?
It won't ever be rescheduled?

52:28.993 --> 52:30.702
Man:
Don't you guys feel
you have an obligation

52:30.702 --> 52:31.702
to talk about this?

52:33.493 --> 52:34.827
"Crime & Punishment,"
new developments

52:34.827 --> 52:36.660
in the child sex abuse scandal
that has rocked

52:36.660 --> 52:38.243
Penn State's
legendary football program.

52:38.243 --> 52:39.993
Today a regular
weekly news conference

52:39.993 --> 52:42.243
with Penn State's head coach
Joe Paterno was canceled.

52:42.243 --> 52:44.326
It would have been his first
since the scandal broke.

52:44.326 --> 52:46.243
Reporters were waiting
when he left practice.

52:46.243 --> 52:49.243
- Guys, you got good questions,

52:49.243 --> 52:51.660
but I can't--
I can't answer them.

52:51.660 --> 52:55.076
Sorry. I just can't do it.

52:55.076 --> 52:56.827
Cooper:
So far, two top
university officials,

52:56.827 --> 52:58.285
Timothy Curley
and Gary Schultz,

52:58.285 --> 53:00.410
have been charged
with failing to report

53:00.410 --> 53:03.577
allegations of abuse
that occurred on university
property.

53:03.577 --> 53:05.993
Sara Ganim, a reporter
at The Patriot-News.

53:05.993 --> 53:08.368
Sara, you spoke to two
of the moms of the victims

53:08.368 --> 53:09.827
allegedly
sexually molested by Sandusky.

53:09.827 --> 53:11.076
What did they tell you?

53:11.076 --> 53:15.410
I mean, both of them
are extremely--

53:15.410 --> 53:19.993
feeling extremely let down
and betrayed by Penn State,

53:19.993 --> 53:23.201
and those feelings
are coming from the charges

53:23.201 --> 53:25.618
levied against him,
Curley, and Gary Schultz,

53:25.618 --> 53:29.785
and then, the, uh, moral
allegations basically--

53:29.785 --> 53:31.868
- Uh, I hope you can hear me,

53:31.868 --> 53:34.451
there's loud airplanes
flying above us--

53:34.451 --> 53:37.577
--uh, against Joe Paterno
and Graham Spanier.

53:37.577 --> 53:40.577
Um, and, uh, one mom
in particular,

53:40.577 --> 53:43.660
her son came forward in 1998,
was not believed,

53:43.660 --> 53:47.285
and, uh, they feel awful
that other children

53:47.285 --> 53:49.577
were victimized because
her son was not believed.

53:51.785 --> 53:54.868
Woman:
The university cancelled
Paterno's news conference

53:54.868 --> 53:56.785
just minutes before
it was scheduled to begin,

53:56.785 --> 53:59.535
and the school freely admits
that the reason is because

53:59.535 --> 54:03.451
of the child rape scandal
marring Paterno's program.

54:03.451 --> 54:07.660
Calls for Paterno's resignation
are really starting to pile up.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.326
Guido: I think it's time
to call somebody.

54:09.326 --> 54:10.785
We need tactical advice.

54:10.785 --> 54:13.159
- Like a crisis guy.

54:13.159 --> 54:15.868
I don't know.
- Let me Google it.

54:15.868 --> 54:17.118
Jay:
You're Googling it?

54:17.118 --> 54:18.535
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's great.

54:18.535 --> 54:20.243
Jay:
We're a major university

54:20.243 --> 54:22.243
in the middle of a very serious
public relations debacle,

54:22.243 --> 54:23.909
and you're solving it on Google.

54:23.909 --> 54:25.410
- Joe!
- Mary Kay: Is that
what I want,

54:25.410 --> 54:27.034
though, a public
relations spin?

54:27.034 --> 54:28.702
- Scott: PR's marketing.
- Sue: Joe!

54:28.702 --> 54:30.743
We already got a marketing guy
sittin' right here.

54:30.743 --> 54:32.285
- Give me your phone.

54:32.285 --> 54:33.951
- No, I can do it.
- Give me your phone!

54:33.951 --> 54:36.076
Tell me what to put in.
What, like, a crisis manager?

54:36.076 --> 54:37.577
- That sounds about right!
- No, no, no.

54:37.577 --> 54:39.368
Crisis management.
A crisis management firm.

54:39.368 --> 54:41.368
- Okay, I'm good now.

54:41.368 --> 54:44.076
Why aren't all these
reporters over at Jerry's?

54:44.076 --> 54:45.660
I'm calling Frank.
He knows somebody

54:45.660 --> 54:47.243
who deals
with this kind of thing.

54:47.243 --> 54:48.368
The car guy?

54:48.368 --> 54:49.618
You're giving me crap
for Google,

54:49.618 --> 54:50.702
and you want advice
from Frank

54:50.702 --> 54:52.368
at the car dealership?

54:52.368 --> 54:54.159
Doesn't the school
have a crisis manager?

54:54.159 --> 54:55.493
Does it look
like the school has a--

54:57.201 --> 54:58.535
Sorry, Ma.

54:58.535 --> 55:00.493
- Okay. McGinn and Company.
- Okay.

55:00.493 --> 55:03.368
Dan McGinn. "Helping clients
solve their most perplexing

55:03.368 --> 55:05.909
and important
reputation challenges."

55:05.909 --> 55:08.034
Huh? What is he, like,
on a top ten list?

55:08.034 --> 55:09.743
Yeah, he's on a top ten list.

55:09.743 --> 55:12.076
- Yeah, call him.

55:12.076 --> 55:14.368
Sure, why not?

55:14.368 --> 55:16.410
Scott:
Ask for Dan McGinn.

55:16.410 --> 55:18.660
Mary Kay:
Oh, hi, hi. May I speak with--

55:18.660 --> 55:19.535
Scott: Dan McGinn.

55:40.159 --> 55:43.034
Ha. You're walkin' weird,
man, you get Sandusky'd
last night?

55:43.034 --> 55:45.702
Yeah, he sucked me off
and then we played Xbox.

55:45.702 --> 55:47.827
- Boy 1: It's a lie.

55:47.827 --> 55:50.909
- Some fuckin' piece
of trailer trash set him up.

55:50.909 --> 55:53.451
Yeah. Kid probably tried
to blackmail him,

55:53.451 --> 55:55.577
Jerry told him to fuck off,
and he's like,

55:55.577 --> 55:57.535
"I'm gonna sue your ass
for $20 million

55:57.535 --> 55:59.660
- for damage to my rectum."

55:59.660 --> 56:01.243
Total fabrication.

56:01.243 --> 56:04.368
It's somebody
from the track team.

56:04.368 --> 56:05.743
Our track team?

56:05.743 --> 56:06.868
Yeah.

56:08.243 --> 56:09.827
Did you see about JoePa?

56:09.827 --> 56:12.285
Of course I saw it, man.

56:12.285 --> 56:14.159
I don't even want
to talk about that.

56:20.201 --> 56:21.618
Hey. Yo, you the faggot?

56:23.326 --> 56:25.493
- Hey. Hey.
- Get him, get him!

56:28.951 --> 56:29.827
Go! Go!

56:34.951 --> 56:36.660
No showers, huh?!

56:36.660 --> 56:38.493
Showers?

56:38.493 --> 56:40.660
Trash

56:40.660 --> 56:44.785
I'm gonna beat your ass, kid.
You fucking faggot!

56:57.827 --> 57:00.326
Man :
I'm happy to come down, Guido.

57:00.326 --> 57:02.326
I've been watching
the coverage.

57:02.326 --> 57:04.285
It sure looks like things
have begun to spin out.

57:04.285 --> 57:07.285
Yeah. It's making this school
look like shit.

57:07.285 --> 57:09.034
They have no idea
how to get in front of it.

57:09.034 --> 57:10.909
I'm sorry, you lost me
for a second there.

57:10.909 --> 57:13.034
Are you looking for advice
for Coach Paterno,

57:13.034 --> 57:14.159
or for the university?

57:14.159 --> 57:16.201
For both.

57:16.201 --> 57:19.743
The thing is, if you hire me,
the issue is, sir,

57:19.743 --> 57:22.326
I'm not sure you and Penn State
are two entities

57:22.326 --> 57:25.034
with aligned interests
right now.

57:25.034 --> 57:28.451
Well, I never
thought of it that way.

57:28.451 --> 57:31.577
Scott:
The guy just represents you,
so you've gotta pay for it?

57:31.577 --> 57:33.368
When it's over,
they'll reimburse me.

57:33.368 --> 57:34.785
Yeah, the university's
reputation

57:34.785 --> 57:36.493
is the board's
responsibility.

57:36.493 --> 57:38.034
This is their crisis.

57:38.034 --> 57:40.702
They need to hire
a crisis manager, not us.

57:40.702 --> 57:42.577
- Yeah.

57:42.577 --> 57:43.702
What the hell is that?

58:01.326 --> 58:06.243
We're here for them.
You don't leave 'em hanging.

58:06.243 --> 58:07.868
- No, no. Joe-- Joe!

100 reporters.
You can't march
out there.

58:10.868 --> 58:12.159
I should go.

58:12.159 --> 58:14.326

59:57.326 --> 59:59.326
Liam:
We saw the CNN interview, Sara.

59:59.326 --> 01:00:01.660
What kind of bullshit was that?

01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:04.326
You know, football programs
make millions of dollars--

01:00:04.326 --> 01:00:05.326
Billions.

01:00:05.326 --> 01:00:06.326
They make billions

01:00:06.326 --> 01:00:07.326
of dollars every year

01:00:07.326 --> 01:00:08.660
off football players.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.285
But JoePa was the only one
who ever said,

01:00:10.285 --> 01:00:11.702
you know, these are scholars,

01:00:11.702 --> 01:00:13.535
they're here to learn
how to become men.

01:00:13.535 --> 01:00:16.326
That's the guy
you want to shit on?

01:00:16.326 --> 01:00:17.827
Like it's his fault
that Jerry's a queen.

01:00:17.827 --> 01:00:19.285
I have to believe
you know the difference

01:00:19.285 --> 01:00:21.034
between a gay man
and a pedophile.

01:00:21.034 --> 01:00:22.868
Are you calling me a faggot?

01:00:22.868 --> 01:00:25.243
Whether or not you're a faggot
has nothing to do

01:00:25.243 --> 01:00:27.076
with the act of a child abuser.

01:00:27.076 --> 01:00:29.326
If you're friend calls me
a fuckin' faggot one more time,

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:31.201
I'm gonna lose my shit.

01:00:31.201 --> 01:00:32.368
Who are you even talking to?

01:00:32.368 --> 01:00:35.993
JoePa made an ethos
in this whole place.

01:00:35.993 --> 01:00:38.909
Like, it fucking mattered
that you got an education

01:00:38.909 --> 01:00:41.034
because you're about more
than just yourself.

01:00:41.034 --> 01:00:43.577
You're a school,
and you fight
for something together.

01:00:43.577 --> 01:00:44.868
Juliet: She went to the school.

01:00:44.868 --> 01:00:46.660
Liam: Yeah

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.993
Whoo. On your way down,
think about getting up.

01:00:48.993 --> 01:00:50.827
Don't be afraid to lose.

01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:52.410
The team that makes
fewer mistakes wins.

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:54.076
Cut your hair, wear a tie--

01:00:54.076 --> 01:00:56.951
- That's literally all JoePa.
- I think she knows that.

01:00:56.951 --> 01:00:59.201
You know why you read Virgil
in the original?

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:02.702
To gain a nuanced understanding
of coded language.

01:01:02.702 --> 01:01:05.577
So when one of your guys says
that something fishy went down,

01:01:05.577 --> 01:01:07.326
in the locker room,
in the shower,

01:01:07.326 --> 01:01:09.243
with a 10-year-old,
you get the fucking gist.

01:01:09.243 --> 01:01:12.159
Liam: She makes money
by telling lies.

01:01:12.159 --> 01:01:15.535
She doesn't have a good lie,
she doesn't get a good paycheck.

01:01:15.535 --> 01:01:19.201
Well, it must not be
a good lie, 'cause it's
a tiny fuckin' paycheck.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:45.743
What have I--

01:01:51.827 --> 01:01:54.660
Liability problem.
What is that?

01:01:57.118 --> 01:01:58.118
Ohh.

01:02:10.618 --> 01:02:14.285
Newhouse:
Who could've stopped it,
and didn't?

01:02:14.285 --> 01:02:19.076
Some it's just lying,
and some of it's people hearing

01:02:19.076 --> 01:02:21.159
- and not believing it--

01:02:22.785 --> 01:02:24.159
Is she gonna be
on the Davis call?

01:02:25.618 --> 01:02:28.326
Yep.

01:02:28.326 --> 01:02:30.159
We need to be on the phone
with Lanny Davis at four.

01:02:30.159 --> 01:02:32.702
Bill Clinton's lawyer.
He's representing Penn State.

01:02:32.702 --> 01:02:33.909
Holy shit.

01:02:33.909 --> 01:02:35.326
He's gonna scream a lot,

01:02:35.326 --> 01:02:37.368
and threaten to sue the paper
into the ground.

01:02:37.368 --> 01:02:39.909
Can he do that?

01:02:43.076 --> 01:02:48.118
The cops. Gary Schultz.
He says he told Spanier,
Spanier said he didn't.

01:02:48.118 --> 01:02:49.702
What's the likelihood
Schultz knew

01:02:49.702 --> 01:02:51.743
and didn't tell
Tim Curley and JoePa?

01:02:51.743 --> 01:02:53.243
Nobody take a shit
around there

01:02:53.243 --> 01:02:55.326
without asking JoePa
for tactical advice, so--

01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:56.326
But he says no.

01:02:57.493 --> 01:02:59.326
The kid he raped
at the Alamo Bowl?

01:02:59.326 --> 01:03:01.827
That was '99,
but I don't think
he told anybody...

01:03:01.827 --> 01:03:04.368
- before the investigation.

01:03:04.368 --> 01:03:08.577
A janitor sees Jerry
pin a boy to a wall, blow him,

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.951
but only tells another janitor
who's scared shitless of Joe,

01:03:11.951 --> 01:03:14.159
thinks he's gonna get fired,
so no report.

01:03:14.159 --> 01:03:15.159
2001?

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:16.451
Well, 2001, everybody knew,

01:03:16.451 --> 01:03:17.660
but they called it nothing.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.118
Horsing around
in a locker room.

01:03:19.118 --> 01:03:20.410
Who

01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:23.702
Spanier said he heard
it was conduct

01:03:23.702 --> 01:03:26.326
that made somebody
uncomfortable. McQueary.

01:03:26.326 --> 01:03:28.034
Wait, that's
what McQueary told him?

01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.201
No, he never talked to McQueary.

01:03:29.201 --> 01:03:30.243
Who met with McQueary?

01:03:30.243 --> 01:03:31.618
Paterno, Schultz, Curley.

01:03:31.618 --> 01:03:33.034
How do they describe it?

01:03:33.034 --> 01:03:35.285
They described it as
"inappropriate conduct,

01:03:35.285 --> 01:03:37.034
horsing around,
not that serious."

01:03:37.034 --> 01:03:38.535
And what about JoePa?

01:03:38.535 --> 01:03:41.743
He said that McQueary saw
something of a sexual nature.

01:03:43.243 --> 01:03:44.951
What does Joe consider sexual?

01:03:44.951 --> 01:03:46.285
I don't know.

01:03:46.285 --> 01:03:47.951
What did McQueary say?

01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:49.201
McQueary said what he saw.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:50.451
The kid against the wall,
Jerry behind him,

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.743
rhythmic sounds.

01:03:51.743 --> 01:03:53.159
Anal rape.

01:03:53.159 --> 01:03:55.243
Probably, but I don't know
if he said those words.

01:03:55.243 --> 01:03:58.201
He was trying
to communicate anal rape,
not snapping towels.

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.743
Well, I know that--
I just don't know

01:03:59.743 --> 01:04:01.410
if we're on solid ground
to say that.

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.076
I don't know if he said
that to Joe.

01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:04.702
Are we having
a role reversal here?

01:04:04.702 --> 01:04:06.827
You choose your words,
you choose your reality.

01:04:06.827 --> 01:04:09.201
How many people used words
that allowed other people

01:04:09.201 --> 01:04:11.535
to understand crimes
against children

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:14.076
as what knuckleheads
do in locker rooms?

01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:15.410
We're in this, too.

01:04:15.410 --> 01:04:16.660
You're first article's
the reason

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:17.951
a bunch of these victims
came forward.

01:04:17.951 --> 01:04:19.535
There's no case
without that.

01:04:19.535 --> 01:04:20.577
You think I don't wanna use

01:04:20.577 --> 01:04:22.076
the strongest possible language?

01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:23.577
But when Bill Clinton's
lawyer calls you--

01:04:23.577 --> 01:04:24.535
I'll deal with that.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:33.785
Scott: He is the soul
of the university.

01:04:33.785 --> 01:04:35.451
Anybody in this town
will tell you that.

01:04:35.451 --> 01:04:39.577
Sue: We built the library,
and he quintupled the endowment.

01:04:39.577 --> 01:04:42.410
- Mary Kay: $2 billion.
- This was a cow college.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:44.909
Sue: They wanted a school
with a good football team.

01:04:44.909 --> 01:04:46.577
But Joe always said
that they should be

01:04:46.577 --> 01:04:48.660
a world-class
academic institution.

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.451
It's not a farm team
for the NFL.

01:04:50.451 --> 01:04:52.785
Scott: It's a, uh--
it's a philosophy.

01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:53.951
Mary Kay:
Like the dorms.

01:04:53.951 --> 01:04:55.034
Would not allow...

01:04:55.034 --> 01:04:57.577
an athletic dormitory...

01:05:08.076 --> 01:05:11.243
Show him the "Why I hate
Jerry Sandusky" memo.

01:05:12.702 --> 01:05:15.034
I don't know...

01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:16.159
what this is.

01:05:20.285 --> 01:05:21.326
What do you think?

01:05:26.993 --> 01:05:30.951
Scott: If there was
a reason to fire Jerry,
he would have found it.

01:05:30.951 --> 01:05:34.660
Okay, stop talking
about me like I'm dead, please.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.827
I'm here.
The press is here.

01:05:37.827 --> 01:05:40.034
Kids are shouting on the lawn.

01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:43.368
Everybody wants to know
what I have to say.

01:05:43.368 --> 01:05:45.118
So, it's time to say it.

01:05:46.868 --> 01:05:49.493
And what exactly
do you want them to know?

01:05:49.493 --> 01:05:53.410
Uh, a tragedy happened.

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:56.827
I did exactly
what I was supposed to do

01:05:56.827 --> 01:05:58.577
as soon as I knew.

01:05:58.577 --> 01:06:00.243
End of story.

01:06:00.243 --> 01:06:04.243
Did other people know?
I don't know.

01:06:04.243 --> 01:06:06.577
Did I know about rumors?

01:06:06.577 --> 01:06:08.326
Who remembers?

01:06:08.326 --> 01:06:10.493
I don't know
what I had for breakfast.

01:06:12.243 --> 01:06:14.034
Sir, uh--

01:06:14.034 --> 01:06:19.159
Point is, it's time to focus
on helping the university,

01:06:19.159 --> 01:06:22.493
not talking about Joe Paterno.

01:06:22.493 --> 01:06:24.827
It's-- What do--

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:28.493
It's got nothing
to do with me, truly.

01:06:28.493 --> 01:06:31.034
What does it have to do with me?

01:06:31.034 --> 01:06:33.493
McGinn: Coach, I have
so much respect
for you.

01:06:34.951 --> 01:06:36.743
I followed your career
for a long time.

01:06:36.743 --> 01:06:39.618
That's why I took the case.

01:06:39.618 --> 01:06:41.577
This is the bad part
of my job.

01:06:45.118 --> 01:06:46.743
You need to step down.

01:06:48.159 --> 01:06:50.076
- You need to retire...
- Scott: Whoa.

01:06:50.076 --> 01:06:52.660
and announce it
right away.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.034
Scott: Okay, wait, wait--
Hold on--

01:06:56.034 --> 01:06:59.076
I want to know, from you,

01:06:59.076 --> 01:07:01.868
what not to say to the press.

01:07:01.868 --> 01:07:03.909
That's why you're here.

01:07:03.909 --> 01:07:06.577
I don't need career advice.

01:07:06.577 --> 01:07:08.118
Scott: Dan,
we asked you to craft

01:07:08.118 --> 01:07:09.660
a message
for the press.
That's it.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.577
This isn't
about what he--

01:07:11.577 --> 01:07:15.993
No. He can't go
out there.

01:07:15.993 --> 01:07:17.909
He's used to being
the emperor holding forth

01:07:17.909 --> 01:07:21.243
in front of a press corps
that just watched him win.

01:07:21.243 --> 01:07:23.368
You're not disciplined enough
to go before the press.

01:07:23.368 --> 01:07:25.034
- That's not true.
- Sue: Hey, he talks
in front of the press

01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:26.785
every day, Mr. McGinn.

01:07:26.785 --> 01:07:28.743
Ma'am, "What I had
for breakfast"
is what people say

01:07:28.743 --> 01:07:30.868
when they're worried
that they do  know,

01:07:30.868 --> 01:07:35.577
and they're old enough
to think that they'll
get away with it.

01:07:35.577 --> 01:07:37.951
I started saying it
to my wife when I turned 40.

01:07:40.159 --> 01:07:42.660
You need to resign
before somebody does it
for you.

01:07:45.868 --> 01:07:47.785
You've had
a great career.

01:07:47.785 --> 01:07:49.410
Spanier: I'm gonna
recommend to the board

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.827
that 2005 be your last season.

01:07:54.618 --> 01:07:57.618
McGinn:
How old are you, sir?

01:07:57.618 --> 01:08:00.201
Sue: He's 84.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:01.618
Paterno:
I may be 77,

01:08:01.618 --> 01:08:03.951
- but I'm not old.
- Joe.

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:06.660
I've raised millions of dollars
for this university.

01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.827
I graduate 85% of my players.

01:08:09.827 --> 01:08:13.951
You wanna fire me...

01:08:13.951 --> 01:08:15.660
try it.

01:08:18.158 --> 01:08:20.618
McGinn:
Folks...

01:08:20.618 --> 01:08:22.326
the question of whether...

01:08:22.326 --> 01:08:25.326
Coach Paterno will retire
or be fired

01:08:25.326 --> 01:08:27.827
is a big part of the public
narrative right now.

01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:30.368
I want you all
to think about that.

01:08:30.368 --> 01:08:33.326
( indistinct voices
in background )

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:40.368
You've had a great career.

01:08:44.033 --> 01:08:47.201
Coach? A great career.

01:08:56.243 --> 01:08:58.827
Man:
I'm very disappointed in JoePa.

01:08:58.827 --> 01:09:01.827
To be honest with ya,
I've looked up to him
my whole life.

01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:05.535
Why would he stick up
for a frickin' pedophile?

01:09:05.535 --> 01:09:09.368
Why would this happen?
Help me with this.

01:09:15.368 --> 01:09:17.033
Man:
Let's go, let's go, lets go!

01:09:20.451 --> 01:09:25.285
Paterno:
Did I see a reverse throwback
to the quarterback?

01:09:25.285 --> 01:09:27.908
Bone Right over 42.
Pitch reverse pass.

01:09:29.535 --> 01:09:33.660
Well, don't practice it
unless you're gonna use it.

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:35.577
We'll use it.

01:09:35.577 --> 01:09:36.410
Yeah.

01:09:40.451 --> 01:09:41.451
So...

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:45.951
Uh, look, guys, uh...

01:09:47.618 --> 01:09:49.535
Th-- This thing, uh...

01:09:49.535 --> 01:09:52.410
is-- is-- is-- gotten, um...

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:55.951
you know, out of hand. So...

01:09:57.909 --> 01:10:01.243
I-- I planned to, uh,

01:10:01.243 --> 01:10:04.577
pack it in,
end of they year, anyway.

01:10:04.577 --> 01:10:06.827
So...

01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:13.868
Guido:
I am absolutely devastated

01:10:13.868 --> 01:10:16.118
by the developments
in this case.

01:10:16.118 --> 01:10:19.618
I grieve for the children
and their families,

01:10:19.618 --> 01:10:22.285
and I pray
for their comfort
and relief.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:25.451
I have come to work every day
for the last 61 years

01:10:25.451 --> 01:10:27.410
with one clear goal in mind:

01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:30.118
to serve the best interests
of this university

01:10:30.118 --> 01:10:34.827
and the young men who have been
entrusted to my care.

01:10:34.827 --> 01:10:37.577
I have the same goal today.

01:10:37.577 --> 01:10:40.118
That's why I've decided
to announce my retirement,

01:10:40.118 --> 01:10:43.535
effective at the end
of this season.

01:10:43.535 --> 01:10:46.410
I love you all, guys,
I really do.

01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:48.951
I want you to know
that we're gonna play

01:10:48.951 --> 01:10:51.451
the rest of the season
together, awright?

01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:53.368
That's the deal.

01:10:53.368 --> 01:10:54.951
That's the new deal.

01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:58.159
There's still a lot
of football to play.

01:10:58.159 --> 01:11:02.827
A lot of interesting things
can happen to all of you.

01:11:02.827 --> 01:11:08.535
I want that for you.
So, I want you to focus on that.

01:11:08.535 --> 01:11:11.909
'Cause that's all
there really is, what we do.

01:11:11.909 --> 01:11:15.076
The rest of this
is just something--

01:11:15.076 --> 01:11:17.993
I mean, what happened
this last week...

01:11:19.535 --> 01:11:20.993
is just--

01:11:23.993 --> 01:11:28.118
It's not your fault.
You had nothin' to do with it.

01:11:29.743 --> 01:11:33.243
But it--
It makes me feel bad...

01:11:33.243 --> 01:11:36.577
that you, uh,
had to put up with it.

01:11:38.993 --> 01:11:42.410
We'll always be
Penn State football players.

01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:44.368
- All: Yes, sir.
- Yep.

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:49.243
Always, till the day we die...

01:11:52.243 --> 01:11:56.410
Paterno:
I wish I could've
done more for those kids.

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.326
Can't say that.

01:11:58.326 --> 01:12:00.201
It's an admission of guilt.

01:12:02.368 --> 01:12:05.743
Well, is there any human person
looking at this

01:12:05.743 --> 01:12:09.118
doesn't wish they could've
done something more?

01:12:09.118 --> 01:12:11.034
You're gonna be misquoted.

01:12:13.243 --> 01:12:14.785
I'm gonna be gone.

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:28.702
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:28.702 --> 01:12:30.618
I'm so sorry.
Aaron tried to call me,

01:12:30.618 --> 01:12:32.243
and I-- I was right--

01:12:32.243 --> 01:12:38.243
I-- I know. There was, um,
a problem at school, and--

01:12:38.243 --> 01:12:40.743
We're not talking
to any other reporters.

01:12:40.743 --> 01:12:46.743
They all want to, but...
we said no to everyone but you.

01:12:46.743 --> 01:12:48.451
You get that, right?

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:49.909
I-- I know. I know,

01:12:49.909 --> 01:12:53.285
and I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate that.

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:57.410
Do you wanna talk to Mike,
Aaron's psychologist?

01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:59.951
I mean, yeah.
That would be great.

01:12:59.951 --> 01:13:01.577
Would Aaron be okay with that?

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.118
I'm driving down there tonight

01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:05.951
and I could meet
with him tomorrow.

01:13:05.951 --> 01:13:09.618
Dawn:
Yeah. Aaron says it's okay.

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:13.410
Woman:
Penn State football coach
Joe Paterno will retire,

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:16.118
but tonight
everyone is taking sides
on what he asked

01:13:16.118 --> 01:13:19.410
in return to coach
four more games.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.285
The poll conducted
on ESPN suggested

01:13:21.285 --> 01:13:23.868
that 61% of the people
out there

01:13:23.868 --> 01:13:26.118
think he should be allowed
that opportunity.

01:13:26.118 --> 01:13:28.285
If you ask people
who are not sports fans,

01:13:28.285 --> 01:13:30.660
you might get
a very different result.

01:13:31.785 --> 01:13:32.660
Sue: Joe?

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.702
- Come on, Joe.
- Yeah.

01:13:36.702 --> 01:13:38.743
Come on, hon.
Let's go to bed.

01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:40.660
- I, uh--

01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.285
Yes, I'm still home.

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:44.201
Yeah, that's enough work
for one day.

01:13:44.201 --> 01:13:46.201
Come on, let's go.

01:13:48.159 --> 01:13:52.076
I think--
hip is acting up again.

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:57.243
- Oh, man.
- Oh, yeah. I'll give you a rub.

01:13:57.243 --> 01:13:59.993
They say that's the--
that's the good--

01:13:59.993 --> 01:14:02.034
the best operation
you can get.

01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:03.201
A rub?

01:14:03.201 --> 01:14:05.827
No, a hip op--
replacement, yeah.

01:14:05.827 --> 01:14:07.326
- You're not there yet.

01:14:09.118 --> 01:14:10.785
I don't know.

01:14:10.785 --> 01:14:12.285
I'll get--
I'll get it.

01:14:12.285 --> 01:14:14.034
Okay.

01:14:14.034 --> 01:14:16.326
- I don't know.

01:14:17.868 --> 01:14:19.451
- Hey, Joe.

01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:21.660
- Hey, Frank.
- Sorry to come here so late.

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.577
- That's all right.
- This is for you.

01:14:26.743 --> 01:14:29.868
They'd, uh--
they'd like you
to call him.

01:14:29.868 --> 01:14:31.868
Call him?

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:34.493
Oh. Yeah, thank you.

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:43.034
Well, the board
of trustees is holding
an emergency meeting

01:14:43.034 --> 01:14:45.410
and there's a lot
of speculation here
on the future

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:47.368
of university president
Graham Spanier.

01:14:47.368 --> 01:14:50.243
Will he resign?

01:14:50.243 --> 01:14:53.368
Will the board ask him
to step down?

01:15:01.951 --> 01:15:04.118
Yeah, it's Joe Paterno.

01:15:13.118 --> 01:15:14.201
What?

01:15:15.743 --> 01:15:16.743
They fired me.

01:15:18.702 --> 01:15:19.785
What?

01:15:19.785 --> 01:15:22.285
Yeah,
effective immediately.

01:15:24.368 --> 01:15:25.660
- Joe.
- Yeah.

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.909
Joe, give me
that phone.

01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:29.034
Let me have
that phone.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:42.785
After 61 years,
he deserved better.

01:15:58.577 --> 01:16:01.201
Man: ...the indictment
of Jerry Sandusky,

01:16:01.201 --> 01:16:02.743
the board...

01:16:02.743 --> 01:16:04.535
Newhouse :
Hey, listen.

01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:06.618
Man on TV: ...Penn State's board
of trustees, tonight,

01:16:06.618 --> 01:16:11.410
decided that it is
in the best interests
of the university

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:13.993
to have a change
in leadership to deal

01:16:13.993 --> 01:16:18.118
with the difficult issues
that we are facing.

01:16:18.118 --> 01:16:21.118
The board of trustees
and Graham Spanier
have decided that,

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:27.034
effective immediately,
Dr. Spanier is no longer
president of the university.

01:16:28.868 --> 01:16:31.785
In addition,
Joe Paterno is no longer

01:16:31.785 --> 01:16:33.493
the head football coach.

01:16:33.493 --> 01:16:34.993
What?

01:16:42.326 --> 01:16:44.285
Man:
Take that motherfucker down!

01:16:44.285 --> 01:16:46.159
Joe Paterno is  Penn State!

01:16:58.243 --> 01:17:00.577
They fired him
with a phone call.

01:17:00.577 --> 01:17:03.577
After 45 years, You know,
who the hell does that?

01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:07.827
Student: He didn't give a shit
about winning.

01:17:07.827 --> 01:17:09.535
Student 2:
He fuckin' won anyway.

01:17:09.535 --> 01:17:11.201
It's a motherfuckin'
travesty.

01:17:11.201 --> 01:17:12.660
Get off his fuckin' lawn.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.118
Students chanting:
We want Joe! We want Joe!

01:17:16.118 --> 01:17:20.118
We want Joe!
We want Joe! We want Joe!

01:17:28.326 --> 01:17:30.326
Joe Paterno!

01:17:30.326 --> 01:17:32.410
You're great, you guys.

01:17:32.410 --> 01:17:37.368
You guys are great.
And-- And let me tell you this:

01:17:37.368 --> 01:17:41.868
You know what I say, guys--
you know, I mean girls too--

01:17:41.868 --> 01:17:45.410
- We love you, Joe!

01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:50.993
Listen. You gotta-- You gotta--
You gotta study now, all right?

01:17:52.785 --> 01:17:57.201
You gotta get
a good night's sleep
so you can study.

01:17:57.201 --> 01:17:58.702
We still got things to do.

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:04.326
I'm out of it now, maybe,

01:18:04.326 --> 01:18:06.076
that phone call put me
out of it,

01:18:06.076 --> 01:18:08.909
but we're gonna go
from here, okay?

01:18:08.909 --> 01:18:10.993
We're gonna go from here.

01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:13.577
You know, because things
have ways--

01:18:13.577 --> 01:18:14.909
they have ways of working out.

01:18:14.909 --> 01:18:17.159
We want Joe! One more day!

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.243
We don't know
what's gonna happen ever.

01:18:19.243 --> 01:18:20.868
Right? And the same with you.

01:18:20.868 --> 01:18:22.410
So, take care
of yourselves.

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:23.868
It's important you do that.

01:18:23.868 --> 01:18:27.702
Right? All right.
You're gonna be fine.

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:31.076
- Oh-- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:18:31.076 --> 01:18:33.868
Good luck to you all,
but listen to me
just a second.

01:18:33.868 --> 01:18:35.410
I thank you for coming.

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:40.618
Pray a little bit for the--
for those victims, okay?

01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:42.451
We'll do that. Okay.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:45.034
- Joe! Joe!
- We love you!

01:18:45.034 --> 01:18:46.909
We are Penn State!
We are Penn State!

01:18:46.909 --> 01:18:48.368
That's right!

01:18:49.909 --> 01:18:51.785
We are Penn State!

01:19:04.785 --> 01:19:07.993
We want Joe! We want Joe!
We want Joe!

01:19:09.993 --> 01:19:12.410
Excuse me!
Can I ask you any questions?!

01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:15.827
All:
We want Joe! We want Joe!
We want Joe!

01:19:15.827 --> 01:19:18.076
What did you think
about happened to JoePa?

01:19:18.076 --> 01:19:20.951
Kids got abused
and he didn't
tell the police.

01:19:20.951 --> 01:19:22.201
You go to jail
for that.

01:19:22.201 --> 01:19:23.951
- Let's go!
- Can I, can I--

01:19:23.951 --> 01:19:25.660
Can I maybe quote you
on that?

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.493
No! I don't want
to get fucking killed
in my bed!

01:19:43.034 --> 01:19:45.577
Young man:
The vice president
of the school

01:19:45.577 --> 01:19:47.577
knew about it in 1998.

01:19:47.577 --> 01:19:48.993
Heard about it twice.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:51.577
You hear it twice
and you don't hang the guy,

01:19:51.577 --> 01:19:52.743
you're just an hole.

01:19:52.743 --> 01:19:55.076
Joe heard about it in 2001.

01:19:55.076 --> 01:19:57.702
He reported it immediately.

01:19:57.702 --> 01:20:00.868
But we're definitely
telling Second Mile,
right?

01:20:00.868 --> 01:20:02.702
Curley:
Uh, yeah.

01:20:02.702 --> 01:20:04.535
And-- and the Child Welfare
thing,

01:20:04.535 --> 01:20:07.243
we're just playing it by ear,
and Graham's okay with that?

01:20:07.243 --> 01:20:11.660
Well, Graham says the only
downside is if Jerry doesn't
get it and this happens again.

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.285
Then we're vulnerable
for not having reported it.

01:20:15.285 --> 01:20:17.368
But we can deal with that
down the road.

01:20:17.368 --> 01:20:18.993
Joe's fine with that.

01:20:18.993 --> 01:20:20.702
- Yeah.

01:20:20.702 --> 01:20:22.535
But he doesn't know
about the last time,

01:20:22.535 --> 01:20:24.118
the thing from '98.

01:20:24.118 --> 01:20:26.034
Yeah, of course he knows.

01:20:26.034 --> 01:20:27.034
I sat down with him
when it happened.

01:20:27.034 --> 01:20:28.618
He was all over me about it.

01:20:28.618 --> 01:20:30.076
You sat down with him

01:20:30.076 --> 01:20:31.410
when it happened?

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:33.076
He wanted
constant updates.

01:20:33.076 --> 01:20:35.076
You ever keep Paterno
waiting on anything?

01:20:35.076 --> 01:20:36.410
He's like a woodpecker.

01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:37.451
We want Joe!

01:20:37.451 --> 01:20:39.493
We want Joe! We want Joe!

01:20:41.702 --> 01:20:44.909
Schultz: Tim, if Joe knows
this is the second incident--

01:20:44.909 --> 01:20:46.577
And you're sure?

01:20:46.577 --> 01:20:48.159
Curley: Look, I've--
I've got emails

01:20:48.159 --> 01:20:50.577
up one side
and down the other. Yes.

01:20:50.577 --> 01:20:53.201
I don't know.

01:20:53.201 --> 01:20:56.743
Gary. If we need to report it,
we'll report it.

01:20:56.743 --> 01:20:58.577
But we start with sitting down

01:20:58.577 --> 01:21:01.034
and talking to Jerry
like a person.

01:21:01.034 --> 01:21:02.326
Joe's fine with that.

01:21:02.326 --> 01:21:06.827
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.

01:21:06.827 --> 01:21:09.577
Sit tight, and this is
gonna get taken care of.

01:21:18.493 --> 01:21:19.785
Man 1:
What do they do first?

01:21:19.785 --> 01:21:21.993
They protect themselves first,

01:21:21.993 --> 01:21:23.577
try to sweep it under the rug.

01:21:23.577 --> 01:21:24.909
That's one thing
the Catholic Church

01:21:24.909 --> 01:21:26.285
and Penn State have in common.

01:21:26.285 --> 01:21:27.451
Man 2:
Joe's not the one who should be

01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:29.159
taking the fall for this.

01:21:29.159 --> 01:21:31.118
It's fuckin' Jerry.
Get the fuck off JoePa.

01:21:31.118 --> 01:21:32.785
Man 3: It's the media
who singled out Joe Paterno.

01:21:32.785 --> 01:21:34.785
They made him look
like a fuckin' villain!

01:21:34.785 --> 01:21:38.493
You call him a legend,
then treat him like a legend.

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:40.285
Man 4:
Here's a man that was told

01:21:40.285 --> 01:21:43.785
that a ten-year-old boy
was being sodomized

01:21:43.785 --> 01:21:47.159
in his backyard,
and did nothing about it.

01:21:47.159 --> 01:21:49.451
Woman: He has done so much
for this university,

01:21:49.451 --> 01:21:51.034
and within the past four days,

01:21:51.034 --> 01:21:52.785
everything we knew
of Joe Paterno

01:21:52.785 --> 01:21:55.326
has been ripped away from us--

01:21:55.326 --> 01:21:57.702
Man 4: And rightfully so!
He's as much of an animal
as the guy that did the act.

01:21:57.702 --> 01:22:00.827
Man 5: Are you kidding me?
How stupid do you have to be

01:22:00.827 --> 01:22:03.827
to go ahead and protest
over taking down

01:22:03.827 --> 01:22:05.660
a ring of child abusers?!

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:07.159
Are you serious?!

01:22:07.159 --> 01:22:08.660
Man 6:
Two years ago, we had no idea

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:09.909
and it was
a great football program.

01:22:09.909 --> 01:22:11.493
Man 7:
Yeah, a few years ago,

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.410
you had several kids
getting raped.

01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:14.993
Man 8: You guys have been
brainwashed by that school.

01:22:14.993 --> 01:22:16.535
It's nothing but a cult--

01:22:16.535 --> 01:22:19.451
Man 9: This has football
written all over it!

01:22:19.451 --> 01:22:21.034
Man 10: He did exactly
the right thing.

01:22:21.034 --> 01:22:22.535
If he had done any more,

01:22:22.535 --> 01:22:24.785
he would have been criticized
for that...

01:22:27.326 --> 01:22:30.159
Fuck the media!

01:22:30.159 --> 01:22:32.410
Fuck the media!

01:22:32.410 --> 01:22:34.951
Fuck the media!

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:37.410
Fuck the media!

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:39.410
Fuck the media!

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:41.076
Fuck the media!

01:22:41.076 --> 01:22:43.285
We want Joe! We want Joe!

01:22:43.285 --> 01:22:45.535
We want Joe!
We want Joe!

01:22:45.535 --> 01:22:47.702
We want Joe! We want Joe!

01:22:55.618 --> 01:22:58.660
Man:
Good morning to you.
It was really a wild night.

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:02.368
It all started after students
here learned that
Joe Paterno had been fired.

01:23:02.368 --> 01:23:04.076
Man 2:
I think it was a witch hunt,

01:23:04.076 --> 01:23:05.493
and everybody
got what they wanted.

01:23:05.493 --> 01:23:07.243
Woman:
Back in 1998,

01:23:07.243 --> 01:23:09.535
this should've
and could've stopped.

01:23:09.535 --> 01:23:11.660
Man 3: It almost makes
Paterno look like a fraud

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:13.618
for everything
he always stood for.

01:23:13.618 --> 01:23:15.368
Woman: And that's what he
has now opened himself up for

01:23:15.368 --> 01:23:18.451
because he always
had the moral superiority.

01:23:18.451 --> 01:23:19.618
Man:
Right.

01:23:21.368 --> 01:23:24.159
Hey guys, guys,
can you just back off the car?

01:23:24.159 --> 01:23:26.076
Jay, one question:
Was your father fired

01:23:26.076 --> 01:23:28.410
because he didn't
tell the grand jury
everything he knew?

01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:31.076
No, I don't-- we don't
have an answer for--

01:23:31.076 --> 01:23:33.660
- Woman: ...Victim Six
in your locker room...
- Yes, OK, take--

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.410
Guys. Guys!
Will you,

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:36.827
out of respect
for the children--

01:23:36.827 --> 01:23:38.118
That's why we're here:
the kids.

01:23:38.118 --> 01:23:39.201
No, I--

01:23:39.201 --> 01:23:40.493
All right,
your kids.

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:43.285
Sorry. Didn't see
them there. Sorry.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:44.451
Thanks, man.

01:23:46.785 --> 01:23:48.743
Okay. Okay, guys. Come on.

01:23:48.743 --> 01:23:52.243
Just go straight up to see
Grandpa, all right? Come on.

01:23:56.368 --> 01:23:58.368
Just go straight up.
Straight up.

01:24:02.993 --> 01:24:04.451
Jay:
I'm gonna get canned.

01:24:04.451 --> 01:24:07.410
Bradley wants me
to come talk to him.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:10.951
I don't think
they're gonna fire you.

01:24:10.951 --> 01:24:12.785
Why?

01:24:12.785 --> 01:24:15.493
It's a witch hunt.

01:24:15.493 --> 01:24:19.827
If they go for you,
there's no reason
they won't go for me.

01:24:22.034 --> 01:24:25.285
The board of trustees wants
to make this all about us.

01:24:25.285 --> 01:24:27.785
And football.
'Cause if they don't,

01:24:27.785 --> 01:24:29.577
it'd have to be
about Second Mile,

01:24:29.577 --> 01:24:30.827
where the guy
actually worked.

01:24:34.201 --> 01:24:36.493
So who's gonna be
left holding the bag

01:24:36.493 --> 01:24:38.326
if they can't blame it on us?

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:42.201
Oh, I don't know, ya know?

01:24:46.577 --> 01:24:50.159
Dad, what exactly
did you...say?

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:53.951
McQueary came to me,

01:24:53.951 --> 01:24:57.034
and he told me what he told me.

01:24:57.034 --> 01:25:02.159
First time I ever
heard anything...like this.

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:04.618
So...

01:25:04.618 --> 01:25:07.493
I knew I couldn't
handle it, so I went--

01:25:09.493 --> 01:25:11.076
I mean, what am I gonna do?

01:25:11.076 --> 01:25:15.493
Go runnin' with some things
I

01:25:17.118 --> 01:25:19.702
So I went to Tim...

01:25:19.702 --> 01:25:21.368
and Gary.

01:25:21.368 --> 01:25:24.285
Why them?

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:28.201
I didn't see it, Jay.

01:25:28.201 --> 01:25:31.034
I didn't see it.

01:25:31.034 --> 01:25:35.159
Tim and Gary are all right,
I mean, they--

01:25:35.159 --> 01:25:37.868
Ya know? Capable people.

01:25:41.493 --> 01:25:44.535
You know, the best thing
about this job...

01:25:45.993 --> 01:25:49.702
is the young people
you get to work with.

01:25:53.159 --> 01:25:57.909
You see 'em come up
as young kids... and mature.

01:26:00.535 --> 01:26:03.827
See 'em grow up...

01:26:03.827 --> 01:26:07.201
overcome some adversity,

01:26:07.201 --> 01:26:09.743
have some success.

01:26:11.034 --> 01:26:13.577
They turn out
to be good people.

01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:17.993
They come back and say,

01:26:17.993 --> 01:26:20.743
"Hey, Coach.

01:26:20.743 --> 01:26:24.285
It was so great...

01:26:24.285 --> 01:26:26.951
being a Penn State
football player."

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.201
Yeah.

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.618
My name...

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.577
I spent my whole life
trying to make that name
mean something.

01:26:43.201 --> 01:26:44.868
And it's gone now.

01:26:57.827 --> 01:27:00.410
Man:
Aaron came forward
three years ago,

01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:03.368
in this office,
after his school told him
not to report it

01:27:03.368 --> 01:27:06.159
because Jerry Sandusky
had a heart of gold.

01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.785
We contacted the police
that day,

01:27:07.785 --> 01:27:09.785
and usually cases like this
it takes a week,

01:27:09.785 --> 01:27:11.159
maybe a month, to get an arrest.

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:14.159
This took three years...
of waiting,

01:27:14.159 --> 01:27:16.451
of a scared boy
telling a horror story,

01:27:16.451 --> 01:27:20.076
to me, to a trooper,
to two other troopers,

01:27:20.076 --> 01:27:22.451
to two other new  troopers,
a grand jury,

01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:24.827
then a second grand jury,
and a third.

01:27:24.827 --> 01:27:26.451
Still no arrest.

01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:29.159
He suffered from panic attacks,

01:27:29.159 --> 01:27:31.368
insomnia, conversion syndrome.

01:27:31.368 --> 01:27:33.076
I don't recall how often

01:27:33.076 --> 01:27:36.743
or how many times
he tried to kill himself.

01:27:36.743 --> 01:27:39.868
Attorney generals
have looked him in the eye--

01:27:39.868 --> 01:27:41.326
in the eye--

01:27:41.326 --> 01:27:45.368
"and said, "We're gonna
arrest this monster next week."

01:27:45.368 --> 01:27:47.201
Then more months
would go by,

01:27:47.201 --> 01:27:48.827
and then more months
would go by.

01:27:49.951 --> 01:27:51.618
Three years he stuck with this

01:27:51.618 --> 01:27:54.743
because he didn't wanna see
another kid get hurt.

01:27:54.743 --> 01:27:57.285
What do you think
about the Paterno situation?

01:27:57.285 --> 01:28:01.118
I honestly don't know
why anybody's talking
about Joe Paterno.

01:28:01.118 --> 01:28:03.993
Somebody six months
from retirement failed
to see the big picture

01:28:03.993 --> 01:28:06.159
and didn't
vigorously protect children?

01:28:06.159 --> 01:28:08.785
Of course you goddamn fire him.

01:28:08.785 --> 01:28:12.993
It's spectacularly unworthy
of conversation. I'm sorry.

01:28:12.993 --> 01:28:16.034
A crime against
children happened--

01:28:16.034 --> 01:28:19.535
why the heck is anyone
talking about Joe Paterno?

01:28:19.535 --> 01:28:23.451
Man:
Coaches on the same staff
for 32 years...

01:28:23.451 --> 01:28:28.243
Man 2: Coaching staffs
spend so much time together
in a room,

01:28:28.243 --> 01:28:31.535
in the dark, with the film on,
and talkin', and--

01:28:31.535 --> 01:28:33.410
these guys are all close.

01:28:36.451 --> 01:28:38.368
He's not going
to prop his feet up.

01:28:38.368 --> 01:28:42.493
He's gonna go help young people
in a program that he started...

01:28:42.493 --> 01:28:44.909
What's this?

01:28:44.909 --> 01:28:46.827
Alamo Bowl.

01:28:47.909 --> 01:28:49.451
When was it?

01:28:49.451 --> 01:28:51.535
Everybody wants dates.
I don't know.

01:28:53.368 --> 01:28:57.410
Before he retired.
'99, maybe.

01:28:57.410 --> 01:29:01.660
Which one is, um,
New Orleans?

01:29:04.118 --> 01:29:05.577
Sugar bowl.

01:29:05.577 --> 01:29:08.118
That was in the '70's
a couple times.

01:29:08.118 --> 01:29:10.618
Yeah.

01:29:10.618 --> 01:29:12.243
He went in the pool
with the kids

01:29:12.243 --> 01:29:15.577
at the bowl games
in New Orleans and Miami.

01:29:15.577 --> 01:29:18.951
Jerry did?
- Yeah.

01:29:18.951 --> 01:29:21.743
Well, you didn't like
to go in the pool, remember?

01:29:23.993 --> 01:29:26.868
I mean, you were working,
on a towel,

01:29:26.868 --> 01:29:29.660
and, uh, I went in with them.

01:29:29.660 --> 01:29:32.451
But I don't throw the kids up
in the air. The dads do that.

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:36.285
And they-- they scream.

01:29:36.285 --> 01:29:38.285
They just love that.

01:29:38.285 --> 01:29:42.118
What

01:29:42.118 --> 01:29:45.951
Yeah. I-- I didn't do that
with our kids. Jerry did.

01:29:48.285 --> 01:29:50.034
What are you saying?

01:29:50.034 --> 01:29:51.702
I'm saying
you couldn't have known.

01:29:51.702 --> 01:29:55.159
Otherwise you wouldn't have
let them go in the pool, right?

01:30:05.577 --> 01:30:08.159
I had a job to do.

01:30:11.702 --> 01:30:15.118
I was working.

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:18.660
I wasn't focused
on the goddamn pool.

01:30:35.243 --> 01:30:37.660
Announcer:
For decades, Penn State

01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:41.368
represented what was best
about college athletics.

01:30:41.368 --> 01:30:43.159
For the past week,
it has reflected

01:30:43.159 --> 01:30:45.951
what is often worst
about human beings.

01:30:45.951 --> 01:30:50.618
And today,
for the first time
since late 1965,

01:30:50.618 --> 01:30:52.660
Joe Paterno
will not be the head coach,

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.285
and those in Beaver Stadium
hope that they can aid,

01:30:55.285 --> 01:30:58.451
in some small way,
in the healing process.

01:30:58.451 --> 01:31:00.285
Penn State and Nebraska.

01:31:00.285 --> 01:31:02.743
From University Park,
Dave Pasch will have the call.

01:31:05.868 --> 01:31:09.118
And the Nebraska
and Penn State players,

01:31:09.118 --> 01:31:12.868
currently sharing
the sentiments of many
around the nation,

01:31:12.868 --> 01:31:15.535
gathering in prayer...

01:31:15.535 --> 01:31:17.743
for the victims
of these aberrations

01:31:17.743 --> 01:31:20.702
to show their solidarity
and support.

01:31:22.618 --> 01:31:27.326
And obviously,
an emotional day
for many reasons.

01:31:27.326 --> 01:31:29.034
A lot of Joe Paterno fans.

01:31:29.034 --> 01:31:31.743
Paterno was to pass
Amos Alonzo Stagg today

01:31:31.743 --> 01:31:34.410
for most games coached
in Division I.

01:31:34.410 --> 01:31:37.118
Commentator:
It's been a week nobody
could've imagined here, Dave,

01:31:37.118 --> 01:31:38.743
at the state college,

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:41.577
the reach and scope
of all that has happened...

01:31:47.743 --> 01:31:49.410
Penn State!

01:31:50.577 --> 01:31:52.243
Penn State!

01:31:54.118 --> 01:31:55.743
Penn State!

01:31:57.577 --> 01:32:00.243
Penn State!

01:32:00.243 --> 01:32:03.577
Announcer: It's been
such an emotional week
for the Paterno family,

01:32:03.577 --> 01:32:05.951
and this morning
Jay Paterno went by early

01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:08.243
to see his parents,
Joe and Sue.

01:32:08.243 --> 01:32:11.034
Fearful that he might
not be able to contain
the emotions,

01:32:11.034 --> 01:32:13.159
he wrote a letter,
but he asked that his parents

01:32:13.159 --> 01:32:15.785
not read that letter
while he was there
at the house.

01:32:15.785 --> 01:32:19.618
"Wait to read it later,
after I leave, Dad"
is what he told Joe.

01:32:19.618 --> 01:32:21.618
A letter to be read, basically
giving him the message

01:32:21.618 --> 01:32:24.493
of what he means to him,
what this day means to him.

01:32:26.076 --> 01:32:27.493
Martinez keeping,

01:32:27.493 --> 01:32:29.159
and then pitching it
the last second,

01:32:29.159 --> 01:32:33.410
and Burkehead is in--
touchdown, Nebraska!

01:32:33.410 --> 01:32:37.993
And Nebraska has opened up
a 17-0 lead.

01:32:39.785 --> 01:32:41.285
We hear in the background

01:32:41.285 --> 01:32:43.868
chants from the student section
for JoePa...

01:32:43.868 --> 01:32:46.368
Female commentator:
The Paternos must be
a letter-writing family.

01:32:46.368 --> 01:32:48.118
Matt McGloin told me
that Joe Paterno

01:32:48.118 --> 01:32:49.951
sent a letter to the players,
a short note,

01:32:49.951 --> 01:32:52.243
and in that letter it said
that he was heartbroken,

01:32:52.243 --> 01:32:54.159
sorry he couldn't be with them,

01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:57.660
but he wanted them to focus
on this game and not on him.

01:32:57.660 --> 01:32:58.951
Dave?

01:32:58.951 --> 01:33:01.493
Pasch:
And McGloin fumbled the ball!

01:33:06.118 --> 01:33:09.368
( broadcast continues,
indistinct )

01:33:19.827 --> 01:33:22.159
...touchdown!

01:33:22.159 --> 01:33:24.118
Two scores in five minutes

01:33:24.118 --> 01:33:27.159
and Penn State is back within
three, with the football.

01:33:27.159 --> 01:33:29.618
...there's always Joe Paterno
on what to do here,

01:33:29.618 --> 01:33:31.326
whether to go
on fourth-and-one.

01:33:31.326 --> 01:33:34.660
Penn State down three.

01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:37.909
If McGloin gets the play off,
this'll be the final play.

01:33:37.909 --> 01:33:40.285
McGloin running around...

01:33:41.868 --> 01:33:44.868
...and it's incomplete.
Nebraska wins!

01:33:56.076 --> 01:33:57.743
- Roll for me, Charlie.
- Right.

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:00.535
Oh!

01:34:00.535 --> 01:34:04.451
The D came out in nickel,
stacked the strong side.

01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:06.868
The O-line got no push.

01:34:09.368 --> 01:34:10.201
What is that?

01:34:11.868 --> 01:34:12.743
Hey, Dad?

01:34:14.034 --> 01:34:16.743
Listen, I talked
to Merrick.

01:34:16.743 --> 01:34:17.868
The Big Ten wants to...

01:34:19.451 --> 01:34:21.535
...change the name
on the trophy.

01:34:21.535 --> 01:34:22.535
Scott:
What?

01:34:22.535 --> 01:34:24.368
The Stagg

01:34:24.368 --> 01:34:25.660
What the hell
they gonna call it?

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.285
Jay:
I don't know.

01:34:27.285 --> 01:34:29.909
I think we call Jim Delany
and-- and talk him down.

01:34:29.909 --> 01:34:31.785
- It's a panic move.
- No, no--

01:34:31.785 --> 01:34:33.702
- Dan McGinn should call.
- Yeah, you're right.

01:34:33.702 --> 01:34:35.285
They're not gonna
announce till Monday.

01:34:35.285 --> 01:34:37.076
If we get to Delany today,
then it'll be fine.

01:34:37.076 --> 01:34:39.535
- Stop.
- No, this is not where we stop.

01:34:39.535 --> 01:34:41.909
This is where we fight.
This is where it starts.

01:34:41.909 --> 01:34:44.076
- We're in the fight
of our lives for this...
- Stop.

01:34:44.076 --> 01:34:45.743
Stop!!!

01:34:49.118 --> 01:34:52.076
No more. No more...

01:35:17.285 --> 01:35:20.159
Sue :
He went in the pool
with the kids at bowl games.

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:24.451
Paterno:
Our kids?

01:35:24.451 --> 01:35:26.451
Sue:
You couldn't have known.

01:35:26.451 --> 01:35:29.159
Otherwise you wouldn't have
let them go in the pool.

01:35:32.034 --> 01:35:33.951
Paterno:
I was working.

01:35:33.951 --> 01:35:39.451
I wasn't focused
on the goddamn pool.

01:35:39.451 --> 01:35:42.159
Sue: Joe!

01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:44.451
Joe, get in the pool.
Go play with Jay!

01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:47.785
Dad, come get in the pool.
Come here, Dad.

01:35:47.785 --> 01:35:52.326
Joe, get in the pool!
Go play with Jay.

01:35:52.326 --> 01:35:53.951
Jay:
Dad. Come here, Dad.

01:35:53.951 --> 01:35:55.827
- Sue: Joe!

01:35:57.660 --> 01:36:00.535
- Jay: Come here, Dad!
- Sue: Joe!

01:36:42.535 --> 01:36:44.909
Aah! Oh my-- Aah--

01:36:44.909 --> 01:36:46.493
Paterno:
Aah!

01:36:55.285 --> 01:36:59.535
Man:
It's a small-cell carcinoma
in the left lung,

01:36:59.535 --> 01:37:02.743
and it looks like
it's metastasized, which--

01:37:02.743 --> 01:37:04.993
It's not what we want to see.

01:37:04.993 --> 01:37:07.326
And we're gonna go at it
with all we've got.

01:37:07.326 --> 01:37:08.785
That means chemotherapy,

01:37:08.785 --> 01:37:11.410
and then, of course,
with radiation.

01:37:11.410 --> 01:37:14.660
But given the bronchitis
you've got now,

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:17.785
your broken pelvis,
and your age...

01:37:44.243 --> 01:37:46.118
- Just leave me alone.
- Get the fuck out of here!

01:37:46.118 --> 01:37:48.285
- This is wrong.
- You're wrong, pal.

01:37:48.285 --> 01:37:49.785
Everybody's got
an opinion.

01:37:49.785 --> 01:37:50.951
What makes
yours special, huh?

01:37:50.951 --> 01:37:52.368
Get out of here.

01:37:52.368 --> 01:37:54.076
Man:
Get the fuck out of here.

01:38:08.493 --> 01:38:09.951
Sara Ganim.

01:38:11.951 --> 01:38:13.285
Hello?

01:38:13.285 --> 01:38:14.702
Man: Hi.

01:38:14.702 --> 01:38:17.159
H

01:38:17.159 --> 01:38:20.410
Um, do I have to say right now?

01:38:20.410 --> 01:38:23.118
Uh, n

01:38:23.118 --> 01:38:25.285
Whatever's comfortable.

01:38:25.285 --> 01:38:29.326
Um, m-my lawyer said
I should call you. I--

01:38:29.326 --> 01:38:30.951
I grew up in State College.

01:38:30.951 --> 01:38:32.743
Okay.

01:38:32.743 --> 01:38:35.743
Jerry Sandusky...

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.326
Yeah. Um...

01:38:39.326 --> 01:38:40.868
there are a lot
of people who have--

01:38:40.868 --> 01:38:43.951
have gone through this.
I'm sure you know that.

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:45.702
Yeah.

01:38:45.702 --> 01:38:49.326
Um, have you--
have you talked
to anyone about this?

01:38:49.326 --> 01:38:53.993
Well, the lawyer and...
I talked to Joe.

01:38:55.326 --> 01:38:58.660
Joe... J

01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.660
We-- We didn't really
talk about it.

01:39:01.660 --> 01:39:05.285
He said that Jerry's,
um, a good man,

01:39:05.285 --> 01:39:07.660
and I shouldn't talk that way
about a good man.

01:39:09.702 --> 01:39:11.993
That was pretty much it.

01:39:11.993 --> 01:39:12.993
Okay.

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:20.076
And, um, do you, uh--

01:39:20.076 --> 01:39:22.410
Do you remember
when exactly it was
that this--

01:39:22.410 --> 01:39:25.201
that this all took place?

01:39:25.201 --> 01:39:28.868
Yeah. It was in summer.

01:39:28.868 --> 01:39:31.034
In 1976.
