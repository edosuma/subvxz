00:03.340 --> 00:07.300
So, Mr. Hammond said it was fine for me to
miss class 'cause I'm already getting an "A."

00:07.380 --> 00:09.980
So just as you suspected, Mom...

00:10.060 --> 00:13.820
I am better than everybody.

00:13.900 --> 00:17.580
All I know is, my little boy was
very brave at the dentist today.

00:18.780 --> 00:23.540
Wasn't he? Yes, he was,
my "wittle snicklefwitz."

00:25.660 --> 00:28.820
Okay, Mom, uh, when a boy
reaches a certain age...

00:28.900 --> 00:32.500
the baby voice
no longer comforts him.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.660
It urges him to kill.

00:36.580 --> 00:40.620
- Shh! Shh!
- Okay, let's, uh, get you some coffee.

00:40.700 --> 00:43.620
Nobody pukes
in the Trans Am.

00:43.700 --> 00:46.940
Mrs. Forman.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.620
Uh-oh, you look mad.

00:49.660 --> 00:53.580
What did Eric do? Bad Eric!

00:55.100 --> 00:57.300
<i>Donna?</i>
<i>Why aren't you in school?</i>

00:57.380 --> 01:00.220
No worries.
I called her in sick.

01:00.300 --> 01:04.060
I told 'em "lady troubles."
No questions asked.

01:05.260 --> 01:08.900
Oh, hey.
Easy there, wobbles.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.820
Have you been drinking?

01:10.900 --> 01:13.460
I hope so.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.020
'Cause if not, this whole
place is a-spinnin'!

01:17.100 --> 01:19.580
Hang on, boys,
it's a twister!

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
So, my mom and I were at
The Hub getting ice cream...

01:58.040 --> 02:00.960
and we caught Donna
with Casey skipping school.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.600
And she was drunk,
in the middle of the afternoon.

02:03.680 --> 02:07.960
It was like...
It was like Sue Ellen on <i>Dallas.</i>

02:08.039 --> 02:11.320
You went to The Hub for
ice cream with your mommy?

02:11.360 --> 02:15.560
Why would you tell me that?

02:15.640 --> 02:18.640
Hyde, the point is,
he went for ice cream without us.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.560
You cannot
pick up a phone?

02:21.640 --> 02:24.360
You know who can't
pick up a phone? Jackie.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.720
I broke up with her
and she never calls to even say hi...

02:27.800 --> 02:31.160
or to offer me sad,
but hot break-up sex.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.400
I mean,
that's just selfish.

02:34.480 --> 02:38.880
Guys, my mom's over at the Pinciottis' right
now telling Bob about Donna being drunk.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.360
You can't do that kind of stuff
in the middle of the afternoon.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.800
It'll mess with your... your... your...
your... your... your... thinking thing.

02:47.760 --> 02:50.440
You know what I'm saying.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.440
Yeah, you got to
stay sharp, man.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.600
That's why I keep
myself pure until 3:00.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.560
2:00.

02:58.640 --> 03:02.520
That's why I keep myself
pure until 2:00.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.320
I'm not wearing a watch.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.200
Hey, you know what? Donna getting
busted is actually great for me...

03:12.280 --> 03:17.640
because now she's got to
realize what a jackass Casey is.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.640
And when she dumps him...

03:19.720 --> 03:24.240
I'll be standin' right here
with open arms and a gentle "I told you so."

03:26.600 --> 03:30.040
Oh, yeah, that could happen.
After all, I mean...

03:30.120 --> 03:32.280
I made that girl a woman.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.920
I made Jackie a woman...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.440
like, a thousand times.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.960
We stole dead fish.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.920
Dead fish?
What are you going to do with dead fish?

03:48.960 --> 03:52.720
You're missing the point, man!
We stole dead fish!

03:52.760 --> 03:55.040
Ah, you just
don't get it.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:00.600 --> 04:03.480
- I just came by...
- I miss you.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.160
- What?
- What?

04:06.240 --> 04:09.160
- Did you say you missed me?
- No.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.680
- Look, just say you miss me.
- Fine, I miss you!

04:12.760 --> 04:15.680
Michael, I miss you too.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.519
And look, I was thinking, since we
broke up because I kissed another guy...

04:19.600 --> 04:21.480
what if I let you
kiss another girl?

04:21.560 --> 04:24.600
I mean, we would be even,
and we could get back together.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.360
Jackie, if you think that me kissin' another
girl is going to bring us closer together...

04:29.400 --> 04:32.400
I'm totally willing
to make that sacrifice.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.960
Thank you, Michael.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.200
- Yeah. I better go wash my face.
- Okay.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.720
Ah, this fish is so stinky.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.960
What the hell are we going to
do with the stinky?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.120
It's simple, man.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.960
We're gonna find a place to hide
the stinky... and ruin someone's day.

04:55.040 --> 05:00.320
Now, question is:
Where, how and who?

05:08.200 --> 05:11.000
The answer is:
There, that and Kelso.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.840
Oh, it's like a bowl...
a bowl for the stinky.

05:19.480 --> 05:23.440
And we will put it, and he'll never find it,
and it will smell forever!

05:26.320 --> 05:30.080
What the hell's going on with you?
You're grounded! No arguments!

05:30.160 --> 05:32.480
Dad, I'm not grounded.

05:32.560 --> 05:36.880
Okay, well, then,
whatever you think is best.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.120
No, not whatever she thinks is best.
You are grounded.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.000
Hey, you're not my mother.
You have no say in what I do.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.520
Well, she's got you there.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.680
Okay, let's see.
Which chick do I want to kiss?

05:56.440 --> 05:59.840
Oh, no, no, no, Michael.
I get to pick the girl.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.720
But you'll pick an "uggo."

06:03.800 --> 06:07.160
You didn't call
"no uggos."

06:08.200 --> 06:10.600
Hey, I just thought
of something.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.440
Your plan's good and all, but what if the
girl that you pick doesn't want to kiss me?

06:23.160 --> 06:26.000
"Doesn't want to kiss me"!

06:27.760 --> 06:30.800
And then I told Donna she
was grounded, and she said no.

06:30.840 --> 06:33.760
She said no?

06:33.840 --> 06:36.320
Can you do that?

06:41.440 --> 06:43.640
No.

06:43.720 --> 06:47.000
I need your help, Red.
I gotta get Donna away from that guy.

06:47.080 --> 06:51.440
Oh, Dad, you know what's good?
Threaten her with the old foot in the ass.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.120
You know, that Casey.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.240
How can such a bad influence live
in such a handsome package?

07:01.400 --> 07:04.320
Bad people should have
a... a big scar...

07:04.400 --> 07:07.160
or an eye patch
so you can recognize them.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.560
The problem is...

07:12.600 --> 07:16.280
you know, there's a point when your kids
realize you can't do nothin' to control them.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.280
There is?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.720
No. Now stop listening.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.280
Bob, I don't want to
get involved.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.480
I've got enough problems with the 14 kids
who think they live here now.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.800
Why do I have to
hold the fish?

07:38.200 --> 07:41.360
Because that's what
the little buddy does.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.360
Oh! Oh! Someone's coming.

07:43.440 --> 07:48.880
So the guy's trying to tell me that his
Z28 is the same car as my Trans Am...

07:48.920 --> 07:51.200
except for the decals.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.920
How can people
be so ignorant?

07:56.880 --> 07:59.400
I see you, Donna!
I see you!

07:59.480 --> 08:01.320
- <i>Dad!</i>
- Don't "Dad" me!

08:01.400 --> 08:03.280
You're not going anywhere,
not with this guy.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.960
You're grounded again.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.400
- How much did we miss?
- Shh! Just started.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.280
Dad, I'm gonna do whatever I want with
whoever I want whenever I want to do it!

08:17.360 --> 08:19.120
We have to have a talk
right now, Donna.

08:19.160 --> 08:24.240
Mr. Pinciotti, sir, let me just say
that you're making a lot of sense here...

08:24.320 --> 08:27.240
and I think that when
I bring Donna home tonight...

08:27.320 --> 08:30.800
you two ought to sit down
and really hammer this thing out.

08:37.880 --> 08:42.480
Okay, that sounds fair.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.400
What?

08:44.440 --> 08:47.840
- You're just gonna let her go off with him?
- What else can I do?

08:47.920 --> 08:51.240
Oh, good God,
that's it!

08:52.600 --> 08:55.440
Everybody in the living room.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.640
Now!

08:57.720 --> 08:59.760
Not you.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.800
Bob, get in here!

09:15.480 --> 09:17.360
Donna, what has
gotten into you?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.640
<i>Skipping school,</i>
<i>showing no respect for your father.</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:23.320
- That's right.
- Shut up, Bob.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.120
Okay, here's snacks.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.320
So, um,
anybody need a drink?

09:31.400 --> 09:34.680
I'll take a rum and Coke
for the road.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.280
Hey, hey, buddy,
little tip?

09:37.360 --> 09:40.880
I think booze is what got you
in trouble in the first place.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.120
How could you take this girl out drinking
in the middle of the day?

09:44.200 --> 09:47.880
Well, you know how it is.
All the older girls were at work.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.880
Can I just say this guy
is not boyfriend material.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.760
I agree. You're not going out with
him anymore. You two are done.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.760
- No!
- All right.

10:03.480 --> 10:07.600
- What?
- You got to admit this has been a real hassle.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.800
I mean, it was fun
and you're a great girl...

10:10.880 --> 10:14.160
but let's just
call it a day.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.240
Wait, you're breaking up
with her?

10:19.760 --> 10:22.280
Casey, I thought
you said you...

10:25.360 --> 10:30.200
- you know, you said you loved me.
- Yeah.

10:30.280 --> 10:33.920
I have this thing where I say stuff
I don't really mean.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.280
- Casey...
- Look, Donna...

10:41.360 --> 10:45.320
I see what you're gettin' at,
and I'm not that type of guy.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.760
Mrs. Forman, what say we rain check
that rum and Coke?

11:03.640 --> 11:07.000
Donna, I'm...
I'm really sorry.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.200
You're not sorry.
You got exactly what you wanted.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.480
- Ow!
- Ohh!

11:26.760 --> 11:30.360
Eric, someone
here to see you.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.840
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.040
Okay. Can I get
anyone a snack?

11:36.120 --> 11:40.200
- Mom.
- Right, right. Have to stop doing that.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.520
So, um, how are you?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.280
Humiliated.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.960
I'm such an idiot.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.960
I got dumped in front
of the whole world.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.320
I don't... I don't even know
what I said to your mom at The Hub...

12:06.400 --> 12:09.680
and I hate that
she saw me like that.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.720
What is wrong with me?

12:11.800 --> 12:13.680
Hey, nothing.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.960
Look, your mom left. Come on, you're...
you're allowed to freak out.

12:19.040 --> 12:24.680
Everybody warned me about Casey,
and I fell for him anyway.

12:24.760 --> 12:26.800
And he's such a jackass.

12:28.360 --> 12:33.840
You know, I... really, really wanted you
to figure that out, just...

12:35.520 --> 12:37.400
not like this.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.760
Eric, I'm just...

12:41.840 --> 12:45.160
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.200
I was so stupid.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.000
- Eric, we should be together.
- Wait, what?

13:05.080 --> 13:08.080
Let's just, like, forget all this
other stuff happened.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.520
Wait. Wait.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.520
Donna, I mean...

13:17.600 --> 13:20.640
if you come running back
to me now...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.600
I...

13:26.800 --> 13:28.960
Donna, I can't be
your second choice.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.160
But you're not.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.400
Eric.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.640
Oh! Oh, where am I?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.400
Mmm. How about
I kiss her?

13:58.480 --> 14:00.920
No way.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.120
She's too tall,
too tan, too rich.

14:04.200 --> 14:08.280
Damn, Jackie, I don't want to kiss
a short, pale, poor girl.

14:13.600 --> 14:18.000
Okay, look, Michael, all I know is
I don't want to stay broken up.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.440
Oh! Okay, you know what, you choose.
Kiss any girl you want.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.680
I choose you.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.520
Michael, that is the most
romantic thing...

14:37.600 --> 14:40.960
I've ever read,
heard about or seen on TV.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.280
Yeah, it was
pretty romantic.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.280
I could tell
while I was doing it.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.440
- Oh, God.
- What?

14:50.520 --> 14:52.360
No, it's just...

14:52.440 --> 14:56.520
Look, one week you break up with me,
and the next week you're Prince Charming?

14:56.600 --> 14:59.440
I'm an incredibly
complex man, Jackie.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.680
Michael,
I can't do this anymore.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.920
Look, Michael,
if you want to choose me, then choose me.

15:11.040 --> 15:16.200
I mean, really choose me.
Let's get married.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.520
What?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.600
Michael, all our problems are
because we haven't decided...

15:28.680 --> 15:30.960
we're gonna be
together forever.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.920
So let's decide.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.880
Hold on.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.480
You want to get married?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.920
Yes, Michael!
Yes, I accept!

15:44.000 --> 15:47.280
Oh! Oh, my God!

15:47.360 --> 15:52.000
You know what? I gotta go tell my dad.
And you... you have to buy a ring.

15:52.080 --> 15:55.440
Just think about it:
We are going to be the Burkhart-Kelsos!

15:58.520 --> 16:01.240
The Who-hart What-os?

16:02.720 --> 16:06.080
Michael and I are getting married!

16:08.240 --> 16:11.600
Yeah, we heard.
That's why we're decorating the van.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.920
But... But not with fish.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.160
Ow!

16:21.280 --> 16:23.400
Let me get
this straight.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.920
Donna wanted to get back
together and you said no?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.720
I said no.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.640
You said no?

16:34.440 --> 16:36.440
Dumb-ass!

16:41.920 --> 16:44.440
Look, I have
my reasons, okay?

16:44.480 --> 16:48.320
What could they be?
What could they possibly be?

16:48.400 --> 16:52.520
Casey dumps her and she comes to me?
Okay, I'm not a rebound.

16:52.600 --> 16:56.600
So you're too proud
to take her back?

16:56.640 --> 16:59.960
And what do you have
to be so proud of?

17:01.520 --> 17:03.560
You're not an athlete.

17:03.640 --> 17:08.280
The only smart thing
about you is your mouth.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.280
And look at you.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.119
Red... Red, he looks fine.
He's just so darn stupid!

17:18.960 --> 17:21.920
<i>I'm... I'm very upset!</i>

17:22.000 --> 17:25.359
Well, stop, okay?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.520
Because, I already feel
bad enough as it is.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.040
- Well, you should.
- Well, I do!

17:34.920 --> 17:36.840
I love her.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.600
God, why do I always have to
screw these things up, you know?

17:47.680 --> 17:50.160
Why does everything
always have to be my way?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.400
That's why we broke up
in the first place.

17:55.480 --> 17:58.680
Uh-huh, well, we've
all known that for a year!

18:04.080 --> 18:06.120
Okay.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
Okay, I have to
tell Donna how I feel.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.120
Then go!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.440
Oh, Red.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.720
I know.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.200
We're never gonna get him
out of the house.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.400
Donna?

18:34.080 --> 18:36.600
Oh, hello,
Mr. Pinciotti, Mrs...

18:36.680 --> 18:39.800
I'm sorry, Joanne.
I don't know your last name.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.760
I have something
to tell you guys.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.640
I love Donna.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.080
Well, she isn't here.
We don't know where she is.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.200
And... And it's Stupak.

18:52.280 --> 18:55.800
Well, uh, if it's okay,
I'll just wait.

18:55.880 --> 18:59.120
Sure.
I always liked you.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.120
Oh, thank you, sir.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.720
But do me a favor.
Don't play with her undergarments.

19:11.200 --> 19:13.440
Somethin' reeks!

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
Man!

19:17.720 --> 19:22.480
- Where are you goin'?
- Bus station. I'm going to my mom's in California.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.880
Oh, my God.
You're runnin' away.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.240
I don't know
what else to do.

19:30.320 --> 19:34.320
No, I know how you feel.
Jackie wants to get married.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.200
To me!

19:40.160 --> 19:41.880
What?

19:41.960 --> 19:47.040
Look, a lot of people don't know this about
us, but Jackie's pretty much in charge.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.920
So it might happen.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.960
But it won't happen
if I'm not here.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.280
You know what, I'll drive you.
We'll both go to California.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.360
Kelso, are you up for this?

20:05.440 --> 20:08.520
Hey, if the <i>Beverly Hillbillies</i>
can do it, so can I.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.080
Great, let's go.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.200
Oh, my God.
What stinks?

20:18.240 --> 20:20.520
This town, baby.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.160
We're leaving that smell behind.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.080
Whew!

20:49.600 --> 20:51.480
Kelso!

20:53.360 --> 20:55.360
I'm not gonna
tell you again!

20:55.440 --> 20:58.520
Well, I was reaching
for my soda. Damn!

21:02.360 --> 21:05.120
Man, Iowa smells
like fish too.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.720
Should have taken the bus.
