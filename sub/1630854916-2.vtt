01:59.240 --> 02:00.640
What happened?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.600
What happened to you? Huh?

02:07.720 --> 02:09.000
Hey...

02:10.800 --> 02:13.040
What happened...

02:14.880 --> 02:16.120
Oh...

02:17.080 --> 02:18.400
It's OK...

02:19.120 --> 02:20.760
It's OK...

03:49.920 --> 03:52.240
It was supposed to be a ceremony.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.880
John. Turn around.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.880
You know, abandonment...

04:11.080 --> 04:13.560
..it's the most primal
feeling we've got.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.560
Turn around and look at me.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.440
Yesterday...

04:39.280 --> 04:40.800
..in that hall...

04:45.600 --> 04:47.240
..I saw a little girl.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.600
Me.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.280
She was staring at us.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.400
She's still in pain, but...

05:09.920 --> 05:11.720
Look.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.400
She showed me our salvation.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.040
Oil.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.960
Tell me what you feel.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.440
Deep down. What you really feel.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.520
I never liked it in school.

05:51.520 --> 05:53.920
I like it a lot better here.

05:55.040 --> 05:59.800
The reason that is, is because
I can do whatever I want

05:59.800 --> 06:02.000
without anyone thinking
that I'm strange.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.960
You're not strange,
don't ever think that.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.320
You remember those moments at sunset

06:25.400 --> 06:28.520
that we watched together
many, many times?

06:28.520 --> 06:31.000
When everything turns
into the same colour?

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
The trees, the grass, your little...
your little hands. Your eyes.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.840
Remember that colour? What is it?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.480
- Red.
- Red.

06:43.880 --> 06:48.640
And I call it "absolute
red." And that's what you are.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.160
When did this new music arrive?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.080
Yesterday.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.840
The composer's name is Tchaikovsky.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.080
Aaron read me the notes.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.360
He learns fast.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.760
He has a gift for music.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.120
No. You have a gift for music.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.920
Which the Lord has given you

08:31.920 --> 08:34.360
because you were deprived
of the gift of sight.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.960
Aaron,

08:35.960 --> 08:38.440
he is only here to make you blossom.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.280
Hmm... Adam...

08:41.280 --> 08:45.040
The world is divided
between masters and servants.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.240
The Creator did not place
different races on the Earth

08:48.240 --> 08:50.840
just so the strong
could destroy the weak.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.120
That's what the president said.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.440
President Grant doesn't
speak for the Lord.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.400
And you do?

09:05.400 --> 09:08.280
I'm an echo of our Lord's wisdom.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.920
Back to Beethoven.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.680
You seen our father?

09:41.000 --> 09:42.920
He left town an hour ago.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.160
Left for where?

09:46.840 --> 09:50.560
Elmdale, to the bank. With Sarah.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.520
They asked me to unlock the
armoury, took extra guns.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.720
They said they have a deal so
good, no one in Elmdale can say no.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.480
He lost his mind.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.480
If the Lady finds out they're
at the bank of her city,

10:04.480 --> 10:06.400
she'll kill'em.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.560
We need the stranger.

10:08.560 --> 10:16.080
'Pray

10:17.400 --> 10:23.320
'Sing my father with my child'

10:25.720 --> 10:30.440
- Spread the Lord's word.
- 'With your blessings...'

10:30.440 --> 10:32.400
The Lord is our Saviour!

10:34.280 --> 10:36.880
- Praise God.
- Remember the word!

10:40.800 --> 10:43.080
No sinners in this town!

11:15.800 --> 11:17.520
Mr. Donovan.

11:18.760 --> 11:20.480
John Ellis.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.200
To what do we owe this visit?

11:26.560 --> 11:30.040
Well, we're here to make you rich.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.840
I see.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.480
Please.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.960
Why'd you break into our home?

12:16.760 --> 12:18.800
Hey, I'm talking to you.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.040
Came to get my money.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.800
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.400
It doesn't matter.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.880
Are you good with a Colt?

12:35.760 --> 12:37.120
Yes.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.360
Well, today's your lucky day, stranger.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.520
If you help us, I'll double your money.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.840
But don't push your luck.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.040
Come with us.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.640
I'll be damned.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.200
Does Mrs. Thurmann know you're here?

13:33.200 --> 13:39.040
Mr. Donovan, we're here
to offer you a deal.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.560
Oil. From my land.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.640
I don't see why the
Lady should be involved.

13:46.720 --> 13:51.040
What we have here is just surface seep.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.240
There's plenty more underground.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.720
How can you be sure?

13:54.720 --> 13:58.920
Well, finance us an oil rig
and we'll prove it to you.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.560
And in your educated opinion, Mr. Ellis,

14:04.560 --> 14:06.480
how much you gonna need?

14:06.480 --> 14:08.720
Two thousand dollars.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.960
Ah...

14:13.080 --> 14:17.120
And you understand, we
can't give 2,000 dollars

14:17.120 --> 14:19.760
to any man who just
walks through the door.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.600
Well, I'm not just any man.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.720
If we're wrong, the land is yours.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.520
I'm not interested in getting
caught up in a land dispute

14:47.520 --> 14:50.520
- with Mrs. Thurmann.
- There's no dispute.

14:52.080 --> 14:55.520
What Mrs. Thurmann conveniently
forgot to tell y'all,

14:55.520 --> 14:57.160
was that, uh...

14:57.160 --> 15:01.720
..her father gave me that
barren crater after the war.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.920
You have paperwork to that effect?

15:06.080 --> 15:09.440
As a matter of fact, I do.

15:21.680 --> 15:25.240
Now, that's a little more interesting.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.440
Well, if you both just step
outside, it'll take me a few moments

15:29.440 --> 15:31.200
to get the loan documents started.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.640
Why, of course.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.840
Come in.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.920
Forgive me ma'am, Mr. Lindon is here.

16:09.640 --> 16:13.240
John Ellis and his tramp
are in town, Mrs. Thurmann.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.440
They've made a proposition at the bank.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.880
Mr. Donovan sent me here
to find out what to do.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.560
What kind of proposition?

16:20.560 --> 16:24.720
They say they found some oil.
Need a loan to extract it.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.160
Oil? Where, in New Babylon?

16:29.160 --> 16:31.040
Appears so, ma'am.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.600
Aaron.

16:34.600 --> 16:35.880
Yes, ma'am?

16:35.880 --> 16:38.200
Get the Forrest brothers,
and tell them to gather

16:38.200 --> 16:41.440
the brotherhood and meet at the church.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.680
Now!

17:00.600 --> 17:02.920
We'll take it.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.440
First time I've seen y'all in town.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.400
Well, we're here for the Crusade.

17:07.400 --> 17:08.600
That so?

17:10.680 --> 17:14.840
My father was an alcoholic who used
to beat the shit out of my mother.

17:14.840 --> 17:18.840
Real sorry about that.
I'll see you at the parade.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.240
Now what?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.680
Now we wait.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.160
We'll have your money ready by Friday,

17:36.160 --> 17:38.680
you can come collect then.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.040
Friday, then.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.240
Please, leave!

18:31.760 --> 18:33.160
This way, this way!

18:43.200 --> 18:44.400
Let's go now!

19:30.080 --> 19:31.240
Withdraw!

19:37.680 --> 19:39.720
Sarah, to the horses. Run!

19:44.480 --> 19:45.920
Come with me.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.880
Uh!

20:13.600 --> 20:16.400
Sarah, come on, they'll be fine.

20:39.080 --> 20:40.640
What's going on?

20:41.480 --> 20:43.720
The Comanches, they're coming.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.560
Sarah!

20:49.560 --> 20:52.240
Hurry up, we're probably
in their territory.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.640
Take a horse! Hide behind those rocks.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.920
- Hurry up!
- Maggie! Go!

21:07.440 --> 21:09.720
- Come on, Caroline.
- I can't...

21:09.720 --> 21:11.320
Yes, you can.

21:12.240 --> 21:15.520
Come on. We just need
to get to that rock.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.280
Look at me.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.440
We're gonna die out here.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.960
Ah!

21:22.960 --> 21:27.080
Don't you ever talk like
that. You're gonna be fine.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.480
Your baby's gonna be fine. Let's go.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.640
I can't feel the baby.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.800
I can't...

22:01.880 --> 22:03.840
I know it hurts, but you can't scream.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.560
- We need to find the others.
- Okay.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.360
Oh we-ee oh...

23:04.360 --> 23:06.200
Just close your eyes.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.400
Sarah, put the gun down.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.120
Give me the gun.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.920
Give me the gun, kid.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.200
Come here, I'm here.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.400
Look at me, look at me.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.480
Look at me, you were brave,
you were brave. I'm right here.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.640
You use your Colt well.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.880
You're free, stranger.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.480
You can go.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.120
I ain't going nowhere.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.000
We can't come back empty-handed.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.360
- What the hell is this?
- Sit down.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.640
- Marty?
- Sit down!

25:05.640 --> 25:07.800
- What're you doing?
- He didn't do anything, please!

25:07.800 --> 25:10.640
Shut up! Sir, give us
the keys to the safe.

25:11.440 --> 25:13.360
Boys, come on.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.040
- Keys!
- Just give us the money, bastard!

25:16.040 --> 25:20.480
No good, nigger bastard,
you're just a useless slave.

25:20.480 --> 25:22.120
What'd you say?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.080
You heard me, shit for brains.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.160
Ah!

25:26.160 --> 25:27.400
Keys!

25:30.480 --> 25:32.080
Which one?

25:32.080 --> 25:33.840
- Does it hurt?
- Ah...

25:35.440 --> 25:37.560
Ah...

25:37.560 --> 25:39.520
Ah, God!

25:39.520 --> 25:41.080
Thank you, kindly.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.320
Whoa...

26:13.000 --> 26:15.040
These are for your trouble, stranger.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.880
There's a city up by the
Pacific where it's always warm

26:20.880 --> 26:23.000
and it never rains.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.200
Bet you that'd make a good home.

26:25.200 --> 26:27.800
Well, I'm sure it would, but...

26:27.800 --> 26:30.120
..I want to stay here in New Babylon.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.520
Nothing's changed.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.520
Least of all our father's mind.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.840
Well, he hasn't seen the money yet.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.360
Hey! You there, come
on, come down. Quick!

26:50.840 --> 26:53.880
Hey! Hey, over there! Come on!

26:55.360 --> 26:57.800
Hey! Everybody, gather round.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.120
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on!

27:00.120 --> 27:01.560
What's he got?

27:02.280 --> 27:03.800
What's that?

27:07.360 --> 27:09.760
Whoo!

27:16.560 --> 27:19.040
Whoo...

27:20.120 --> 27:22.400
Ah! Yeah!

27:36.280 --> 27:38.440
- OK?
- God bless you, sir.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.080
God bless you!

28:02.600 --> 28:04.000
Sarah.

28:05.600 --> 28:07.280
Sarah, stop.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.440
It's me.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.600
Look at you.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.200
They're all dead.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.240
Mom...

28:42.680 --> 28:45.520
Sammy... Timmy...

28:48.440 --> 28:51.120
Uncle Elijah and Aunt Caroline...

28:51.120 --> 28:52.720
They're all dead.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.920
And I died too, right
there in that farm.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.400
So, just go.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.760
Go west and forget about me.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.520
- Come with me.
- No, I'm not leaving here.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.560
Ever.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.360
Then neither am I.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.560
If John finds out you fought
for the South, he'll kill you.

29:24.240 --> 29:25.920
Are you gonna marry him?

29:28.120 --> 29:29.600
Are you gonna marry him?

29:31.600 --> 29:32.960
Yeah.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.280
John saved my life.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.640
He was there that night, you weren't.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.720
What're you doing?

29:52.720 --> 29:55.120
- You have to go.
- What're you doing?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.640
You have to go!

29:58.760 --> 30:00.320
I can't ask you again.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.960
Go ahead and do it.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.120
They will find out who I am, anyway.

30:13.120 --> 30:17.200
And they'll hang me,
outside your new house.

30:19.160 --> 30:21.240
And you can watch me hang.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.240
So please shoot me, just
go ahead. Just do it.

30:28.640 --> 30:30.400
Do it!

30:34.200 --> 30:36.080
Just shoot your father.

31:17.320 --> 31:23.040
I'm very aware we lost control
yesterday. We lost innocent lives.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.880
Tonight, someone robbed our bank,

31:26.880 --> 31:29.760
I'm sure it was people from New Babylon.

31:29.760 --> 31:33.640
And I know there's a
spy on our plantation.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.040
Let's make no mistake
about who's at fault.

31:39.200 --> 31:42.360
I've known John Ellis
since he was a boy.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.400
The only thing that
ever moved him is hatred,

31:46.800 --> 31:49.360
even when he pretends it's love.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.960
John Ellis is chaos.

31:52.960 --> 31:57.160
He, his children, and his whore

31:57.160 --> 32:00.320
want to wipe us off the face
of this Earth and drag us

32:00.320 --> 32:01.960
into the kingdom of Satan.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.120
No, he won't.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.840
We will never give in.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.120
Never!

32:07.120 --> 32:08.680
We will fight back.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.120
Yes!

32:10.120 --> 32:14.040
And we will destroy what
needs to be destroyed.

32:14.040 --> 32:15.800
Yeah!

32:15.800 --> 32:17.760
Let's pray.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.920
Sixteen, seventeen...

32:29.240 --> 32:32.000
..two, three...

32:35.600 --> 32:38.080
Thank you. Sixteen...

32:38.080 --> 32:39.440
I got mine.

33:00.200 --> 33:05.160
You wanna stay in this place,
you gotta have a vision.

33:07.520 --> 33:09.280
You gotta have dreams.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.680
A man who can't dream...

33:15.680 --> 33:17.280
..that's a man lost.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.440
Forever.

33:28.520 --> 33:31.840
My sons told me what you did in Elmdale.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.960
You want a home, it's yours.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.360
Father says you gotta
give back the gun though.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.440
Don't make us regret it.

34:57.240 --> 34:58.760
Welcome to New Babylon.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.520
Did you give the stranger a house?

35:22.520 --> 35:24.160
It was Father's decision.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.760
One last time: who robbed our bank?

35:45.760 --> 35:47.160
Please, I'm begging you.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.360
I don't know. I'm begging you.

35:50.360 --> 35:53.600
I came here to your plantation
to work and feed my son.

35:53.600 --> 35:56.200
I had nothing to do with
the business of New Babylon.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.240
Was it ordered by John Ellis?

35:59.280 --> 36:04.080
You see, my son is blind
because of sinners like you.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.480
So you need to speak up.

36:08.480 --> 36:11.040
I don't know anything, ma'am.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.360
Please.

36:15.160 --> 36:18.840
I'm begging you, I'm
begging you, I'm begging you.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.440
Somebody, somebody,
somebody... Somebody, please!

36:23.440 --> 36:24.840
Help me, Lord-

36:27.800 --> 36:31.240
The Lord won't save no liar.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.560
Two days ago you wanted to hang
him and now you give him a roof?

37:24.560 --> 37:27.080
Two days ago you were
the one who stopped me.

37:27.080 --> 37:29.600
I never told you to let him stay!

37:29.600 --> 37:32.960
Elizabeth tried to kill
us in cold blood, Sarah.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.840
I didn't think she'd go that far.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.160
And that's why we're in
more danger now than ever.

37:37.160 --> 37:41.120
And that man... That man...

37:42.440 --> 37:44.240
..he might come in useful.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.360
We don't need him.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.720
We are fine without him.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.120
Why do you care about this so much?

38:22.480 --> 38:25.600
Because I don't trust
a cowboy with no ideals.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.200
I, Sarah X...

38:56.720 --> 38:59.080
..am standing here today...

39:03.080 --> 39:08.000
..to offer you, John Ellis...

39:12.680 --> 39:15.480
- ..my unconditional love...
- Ah...

39:28.960 --> 39:31.000
..and eternal devotion.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.120
Until death do us part.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.320
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.040
I'm sorry...

40:34.320 --> 40:35.960
I'm sorry.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.920
He
- He comes to me in my dreams. He's all I see.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.640
He's all I see. I
- I feel him inside me.

40:45.680 --> 40:49.320
I ask for redemption. Please,
don't leave me, my Lord.

40:50.680 --> 40:54.880
He asked me again to forsake my faith.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.760
To deny You and Your mother,

40:58.760 --> 41:02.240
and all the angels, and
all the saints in heaven.
