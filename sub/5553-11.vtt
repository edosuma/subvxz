Hey, Thursday can't

02:17.629 --> 02:20.130
I'm taking off work

Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.673
And you do realize
I bought my ticket

02:30.675 --> 02:32.475
when Amy and I were broken up?

02:33.945 --> 02:36.112
I hope you didn't need anything
in that case,

02:36.114 --> 02:37.547
'cause it's closed.

02:37.549 --> 02:39.916
You guys just got back together.

02:39.918 --> 02:42.085
You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.

02:42.087 --> 02:44.354
I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.

02:44.356 --> 02:46.356
But someone might
spoil the movie.

02:46.358 --> 02:48.424
No one can spoil
Amy's birthday for me.

02:48.426 --> 02:49.726
Surprise! She's even older.

02:49.728 --> 02:52.028
Who saw that coming?

02:52.030 --> 02:53.830
Oh, that's nice.

02:53.832 --> 02:56.299
Put that on her cake.

02:58.570 --> 03:01.237
(whirring)

03:05.977 --> 03:08.912
Oh, great. This again.

03:08.914 --> 03:12.649
Arthur, what brings you back?

03:12.651 --> 03:14.884
Uh, beats me. I-I just...

03:14.886 --> 03:17.487
hope this isn't a-a sex dream.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.257
In the past, you've come to me

03:21.259 --> 03:23.092
when I'm struggling
with a dilemma.

03:23.094 --> 03:26.262
And-and the one time where...
where you were afraid,

03:26.264 --> 03:30.567
and you needed me for...
for a night light.

03:32.204 --> 03:34.070
What's-what's troubling you?

03:34.940 --> 03:36.639
Well...

03:36.641 --> 03:38.608
my friends are telling me

03:38.610 --> 03:41.044
I shouldn't abandon
my girlfriend on her birthday

03:41.046 --> 03:43.846
to see the new <i> Star Wars</i> movie.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.249
Well, sounds right.

03:47.619 --> 03:50.086
Can... can I get out of this...

03:50.088 --> 03:52.989
muumuu now?

03:52.991 --> 03:55.058
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

03:55.060 --> 03:57.994
the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.

03:57.996 --> 04:02.198
And they... they-they don't wear
underwear.

04:07.138 --> 04:09.372
So, you agree with my friends

04:09.374 --> 04:11.574
that I should skip the premiere?

04:11.576 --> 04:15.211
Uh, do... do you
love this girl?

04:15.213 --> 04:17.146
Yes.

04:17.148 --> 04:20.416
But she knows how important
<i>Star Wars</i> is to me.

04:20.418 --> 04:22.719
Well, maybe
you should show her how...

04:22.721 --> 04:25.555
how important <i> she</i> is to you.

04:25.557 --> 04:29.325
By seeing the movie
she'd want me to see?

04:30.495 --> 04:33.730
Sheldon, you-you can see
this movie whenever you want.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.934
But you only have
a limited number of days

04:37.936 --> 04:41.070
that you-you can be
with this woman.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.905
Be with her.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.676
You're right.

04:46.678 --> 04:48.344
Great.

04:49.214 --> 04:51.180
Where are you going?

04:51.182 --> 04:56.085
I don't know, but hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.890
(cell phone ringtone playing)

05:05.330 --> 05:07.330
Sheldon, what's wrong?

05:07.332 --> 05:10.867
I wanted to let you know I'll be
spending your birthday with you.

05:11.736 --> 05:13.870
Okay.

05:13.872 --> 05:17.173
See, I-I had tickets to the
<i>Star Wars</i> premiere that night,

05:17.175 --> 05:19.609
but Professor Proton came to me
in a dream dressed as

05:19.611 --> 05:22.712
Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me
I should be with you.

05:23.548 --> 05:25.448
Obi-what?

05:25.450 --> 05:28.384
I'll-I'll let you get back
to sleep now. Good night.

05:28.386 --> 05:29.852
Okay. Good night. Wait.

05:29.854 --> 05:31.287
Um, Sheldon,

05:31.289 --> 05:34.223
were you actually <i> not</i> gonna
spend my birthday with me?

05:36.061 --> 05:38.828
It's late. Got to go. Bye.

05:39.998 --> 05:41.297
Good for Sheldon deciding

05:41.299 --> 05:43.599
to stay with Amy on her birthday.
I know.

05:43.601 --> 05:45.568
It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.

05:45.570 --> 05:49.539
Well, we could wait a
couple days and see it together.

05:50.608 --> 05:52.508
(loud laughter)

05:52.510 --> 05:54.844
Hello.

05:54.846 --> 05:56.746
Hey. We're going to the comic
book store. You want to come?

05:56.748 --> 05:58.181
No, I can't.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.316
I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.

06:00.318 --> 06:01.451
Which leads me

06:01.453 --> 06:03.586
to the following bit
of business.

06:03.588 --> 06:05.822
This is my ticket to <i> Star Wars.</i>

06:05.824 --> 06:08.358
I don't have to tell you
it is worth far more

06:08.360 --> 06:11.994
than its face value
of $15.50.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.731
I trust you'll give it
to someone worthy.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.032
You got it.

06:16.034 --> 06:17.633
Well, Penny might
want to join us.

06:17.635 --> 06:21.070
This is my ticket
to <i> Star Wars.</i>

06:22.140 --> 06:23.439
(knocking)
SHELDON: Penny.

06:23.441 --> 06:24.607
Penny?
(knocking)

06:24.609 --> 06:25.742
(knocking)
Penny?

06:25.744 --> 06:28.111
What happens if
I say, “Come in”?

06:28.113 --> 06:29.779
Well, find out.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.114
Come in!

06:34.419 --> 06:36.386
(knocking)
Bernadette?

06:36.388 --> 06:38.388
(knocking) Bernadette?
Bernadette?

06:38.390 --> 06:40.656
Come in!

06:40.658 --> 06:42.692
SHELDON:
Keep it up.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.727
I got nowhere else to be.

06:44.729 --> 06:46.696
Just come in.

06:47.832 --> 06:50.433
For future reference,
if I want to watch <i> Mean Girls,</i>

06:50.435 --> 06:52.902
I'll stream it on Netflix.

06:52.904 --> 06:55.037
We're sorry.
What do you need?

06:55.039 --> 06:56.406
Well, as you know,

06:56.408 --> 06:58.408
I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,

06:58.410 --> 06:59.642
and I could use your assistance

06:59.644 --> 07:01.511
in helping me select
the perfect gift.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.045
Sure.
Well, so far,

07:03.047 --> 07:04.480
I've come up with three ideas.

07:04.482 --> 07:06.082
The first is a chance for her

07:06.084 --> 07:07.917
to play the harp
with the L.A. Philharmonic.

07:07.919 --> 07:09.652
Wow. You can really
arrange that?

07:09.654 --> 07:11.187
Well, I said a chance,
you know.

07:11.189 --> 07:12.622
When you tell them
it's your birthday

07:12.624 --> 07:14.023
at Bennigan's,
they make a fuss.

07:14.025 --> 07:16.292
I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.562
How about something
a little more realistic?

07:19.564 --> 07:22.165
Well, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters,

07:22.167 --> 07:24.967
so I was thinking of getting her
an all-expense-paid trip

07:24.969 --> 07:27.804
to the Wisconsin Sheep
and Wool Festival.

07:30.542 --> 07:33.576
Sorry. I was waiting
for the bazinga.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.778
Hold on. It could be romantic.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.213
The two of them away together,

07:37.215 --> 07:40.082
keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.617
No, no, no, no.
She'd be going alone.

07:41.619 --> 07:43.286
Well, if you think
I'm afraid of birds,

07:43.288 --> 07:44.587
you should see me around sheep.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.823
Okay, well,
what's the third option?

07:46.825 --> 07:48.291
That I have coitus with her.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.625
(glass shatters on floor)

07:56.701 --> 07:59.602
What do you think about giving
Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.137
I don't know.

08:01.139 --> 08:03.606
Have you ever seen a movie
with Stuart before?

08:03.608 --> 08:06.142
It's like going
with your grandpa.

08:06.144 --> 08:07.543
Instead of eating popcorn,

08:07.545 --> 08:09.779
he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware

08:09.781 --> 08:12.181
and a thermos full of soup.

08:12.183 --> 08:14.217
He's not that bad.

08:14.219 --> 08:17.286
Hey, Stuart, got any plans
Thursday night?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.989
My, uh... my doctor's worried
about my circulation,

08:19.991 --> 08:22.859
so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.

08:22.861 --> 08:24.494
Why?

08:24.496 --> 08:26.662
Well...
Hey, you guys.

08:26.664 --> 08:28.297
Oh, make sure
to wear sensible shoes.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.533
Wil, want to go
to <i> Star Wars</i> Thursday?

08:30.535 --> 08:31.667
Absolutely.

08:31.669 --> 08:33.236
Fine, take Wil.

08:33.238 --> 08:35.505
See if <i> he</i> brings you
clam chowder.

08:37.674 --> 08:39.442
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

08:39.443 --> 08:41.409
Let's-let's... let's just
recap our options.

08:41.412 --> 08:44.614
All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...

08:44.616 --> 08:46.415
Wild thang.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.987
Which do you think
she'd prefer?

08:50.989 --> 08:54.757
Because I checked the Sheep
and Wool Festival Web site,

08:54.759 --> 08:57.226
and there's only
8,000 tickets left.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.064
Sheldon, being physical with
Amy is a huge step for you.

09:02.066 --> 09:03.866
Yeah, are you ready
for this?

09:03.868 --> 09:07.136
Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,

09:07.138 --> 09:09.772
but I'd like to show her
how important she is,

09:09.774 --> 09:12.642
and it feels like
now might be the right time.

09:12.644 --> 09:14.410
Sheldon, that's
so beautiful.

09:14.412 --> 09:16.245
Then it's settled.

09:16.247 --> 09:18.915
Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.

09:28.543 --> 09:29.942
Thanks for taking me out.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.011
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

09:32.013 --> 09:33.145
Why not celebrate early?

09:33.147 --> 09:34.947
So where do
you want to go?

09:34.949 --> 09:37.483
I heard that new Mexican place
on Green Street is good.

09:37.485 --> 09:41.821
Sure, sure. Or we could
take you to get a bikini wax.

09:43.424 --> 09:46.893
Why would I get a bikini
wax for my birthday?

09:46.895 --> 09:49.662
Uh, I don't know.
It was just a thought.

09:49.664 --> 09:51.731
I think I'll just
stick to Mexican.

09:51.733 --> 09:55.902
Great. And then maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,

09:55.904 --> 09:58.738
and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,

09:58.740 --> 10:01.073
we can answer them.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.277
Okay, what
is going on?

10:04.279 --> 10:06.312
Oh, we just want you
to be prepared

10:06.314 --> 10:08.648
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.783
What surprises?

10:10.785 --> 10:12.718
Oh.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.987
We don't want to
spoil anything,

10:14.989 --> 10:19.926
but you should know that Sheldon
said he's ready to be physical.

10:19.928 --> 10:22.428
You shut your damn mouth!

10:26.067 --> 10:28.801
You actually heard him say this?

10:28.803 --> 10:30.102
Yes. He said he wants
to do something

10:30.104 --> 10:31.537
to show you how much
you mean to him.

10:31.539 --> 10:36.108
(exhales)
I-I can't believe it. I...

10:37.512 --> 10:39.812
I don't know what to say.

10:39.814 --> 10:41.681
Well, we're really
happy for you,

10:41.683 --> 10:43.382
and we know how
much he cares...

10:43.384 --> 10:45.151
I do know what to say!
Let's get me waxed!

10:50.758 --> 10:52.959
(whirring)

10:54.595 --> 10:58.864
Why isn't it ever
Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

10:59.934 --> 11:01.600
You're back.

11:01.602 --> 11:05.805
It-it doesn't seem
like it's up to me.

11:05.807 --> 11:08.374
I suppose you're here because...

11:08.376 --> 11:11.610
I've decided to be physical
with my girlfriend,

11:11.612 --> 11:14.280
and I've never done that before.

11:14.282 --> 11:18.417
E-Excuse me for a moment.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.492
(lightsaber humming)

11:34.035 --> 11:36.869
Well, it was worth a shot.

11:38.706 --> 11:41.674
So, can you help me?

11:41.676 --> 11:44.210
Uh, all right. Um...

11:44.212 --> 11:47.680
once-once the man gets

11:47.682 --> 11:50.649
the-the woman out of her...
out of her bloomers...

11:50.651 --> 11:53.652
Oh, no.
Not that.

11:53.654 --> 11:56.155
I-I understand
the mechanics.

11:56.157 --> 11:58.457
Oh, good, good. 'Cause, uh,

11:58.459 --> 12:02.261
I have no idea
what kids these days are...

12:02.263 --> 12:05.698
calling their-their parts.

12:07.835 --> 12:10.503
I think they say “junk.”

12:11.873 --> 12:14.707
What is happening to this world?

12:15.943 --> 12:20.079
What-what do you
actually need to know?

12:21.516 --> 12:24.016
This is an important night
for us,

12:24.018 --> 12:26.785
and I'm worried
I might be overwhelmed

12:26.787 --> 12:29.121
and ruin everything.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.893
Sheldon, if-if you're
with the right person,

12:33.895 --> 12:36.529
it-it'll be okay.

12:38.866 --> 12:41.133
Thank you, Arthur.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.303
You are the wisest of the wise.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.972
Well, that's-that's very nice
of you to say,

12:46.974 --> 12:49.575
but I think
I'm just an expression of...

12:49.577 --> 12:52.545
of your unconscious mind.

12:52.547 --> 12:55.114
Oh, sure. Yeah.

12:55.116 --> 12:59.218
Well, you're fun to look at.

13:02.790 --> 13:04.156
Tonight's the night!

13:04.158 --> 13:06.125
Yeah, the wait
is finally over!

13:06.127 --> 13:09.328
I know. Then you'll finally stop
talking about it!

13:09.330 --> 13:11.330
Ready to go?
Let's do this.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.485
Have fun, guys!

13:12.486 --> 13:14.667
We will.
I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.

13:14.669 --> 13:15.358
I know.

13:15.382 --> 13:17.338
We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

13:20.041 --> 13:22.608
(singsongy):
No, they're not.

13:22.610 --> 13:26.011
Knowing them, they will.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.381
(indistinct chatter)

13:30.218 --> 13:32.818
T minus 15 minutes!

13:32.820 --> 13:34.119
Oh, did you hear
from Wil?

13:34.121 --> 13:36.488
Yeah, he's on his way.
Time for bladder check.

13:36.490 --> 13:37.890
Check.

13:37.892 --> 13:39.158
Check.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.727
Check. Wait.

13:42.930 --> 13:44.897
Screw it. I'm holding it.

13:44.899 --> 13:46.232
(crowd booing)

13:46.234 --> 13:48.000
What is everyone
booing at?

13:48.002 --> 13:50.202
(booing continues)

13:54.609 --> 13:56.108
Hey, guys. What's up?

13:57.211 --> 13:59.445
Um, hey, Wil.
What you doin'?

13:59.447 --> 14:02.615
I was on <i> Star Trek.</i> I'm just
rooting for the home team.

14:02.617 --> 14:04.416
MAN:
<i>Star Trek</i> stinks!

14:04.418 --> 14:07.686
Yeah? Live long
and suck it!

14:10.091 --> 14:12.258
(romantic music playing)

14:14.295 --> 14:16.228
(knocking)
SHELDON: Birthday girl.

14:16.230 --> 14:19.498
Birthday girl.
Birthday girl.

14:21.969 --> 14:23.535
Come in!

14:23.537 --> 14:26.305
Oh!

14:31.379 --> 14:32.411
Hi, Sheldon.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.879
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

14:33.881 --> 14:35.481
I also got you a balloon,

14:35.483 --> 14:38.183
but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.

14:38.185 --> 14:40.786
That's okay. Come on in.

14:40.788 --> 14:42.087
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.990
Um, I'll... I'm gonna go put
these in water.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.659
Okay.

14:46.661 --> 14:49.295
Ooh, this is different, hmm?

14:49.297 --> 14:51.096
Candles and music.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.598
Do you like it?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.833
It's kind of spooky.

14:54.835 --> 14:56.602
I can change it back.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.137
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

14:58.139 --> 15:01.840
As long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

15:02.677 --> 15:05.511
(panting)

15:05.513 --> 15:07.980
So...

15:09.283 --> 15:11.717
What'd you have in mind
for tonight?

15:11.719 --> 15:14.420
I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.

15:14.422 --> 15:18.824
If we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.

15:18.826 --> 15:21.860
Um, that sounds nice, but...

15:21.862 --> 15:24.830
I'm not really hungry right now.

15:24.832 --> 15:27.466
I thought maybe...

15:27.468 --> 15:31.103
we could do presents first.
Oh.

15:31.972 --> 15:33.605
All right.

15:33.607 --> 15:35.708
Um...

15:35.710 --> 15:39.511
I should probably tell you
something about this gift.

15:39.513 --> 15:43.515
You mean before you...

15:43.517 --> 15:46.719
(suggestively):
give it to me?

15:48.789 --> 15:51.090
Yes.

15:51.092 --> 15:54.960
May I ask you a question
before I...

15:54.962 --> 15:57.796
(suggestively):
give it to you?

15:57.798 --> 16:00.566
Of course.
Why are we saying

16:00.568 --> 16:03.202
“give it to you” like that?

16:03.204 --> 16:05.904
Sheldon,

16:05.906 --> 16:09.241
I know your present is...

16:09.243 --> 16:13.178
for us to be intimate tonight.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.581
I see.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.316
Is that all right?

16:22.823 --> 16:25.190
I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.726
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.730
Yes.

16:33.067 --> 16:36.268
You know what, let me pull a
quick contract off the Internet.

16:41.242 --> 16:44.576
So, if you don't like <i> Star</i>
<i>Wars,</i> why are you here?

16:44.578 --> 16:45.711
Oh, I'm just having fun.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.546
Everyone takes <i> Star</i>
<i>Wars</i> so seriously.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.416
Like if the movie's bad,
it's gonna ruin their lives.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.151
Is it bad?
Did you hear something?

16:52.153 --> 16:55.521
Oh, my God. It's bad.
Somebody kill me.

16:55.523 --> 16:58.090
See? That's
what I mean.

16:58.092 --> 16:59.992
When you wake up in the
morning, whether this is

16:59.994 --> 17:02.127
the greatest movie ever
or a total piece of crap,

17:02.129 --> 17:03.729
your life isn't
gonna change at all.

17:04.598 --> 17:06.632
He's right.

17:06.634 --> 17:07.833
Yeah.

17:07.835 --> 17:09.401
No matter what happens,

17:09.403 --> 17:11.537
we're coming back tomorrow
to watch it again.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.442
Do you think Sheldon's actually
gonna go through with it?

17:16.444 --> 17:17.643
I don't know.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.045
He said he's ready.
Yeah, but he also swore

17:20.047 --> 17:22.614
this was the year he'd be able
to pull the guts out

17:22.616 --> 17:24.683
of a pumpkin.

17:24.685 --> 17:26.752
Well, I'm gonna stay positive.
I mean, we talked.

17:26.753 --> 17:29.221
I told him what women like,
and after he stopped giggling,

17:29.223 --> 17:31.623
he seemed pretty sure
of himself.

17:44.505 --> 17:45.904
Hi.

17:45.906 --> 17:48.106
Hello.

17:49.410 --> 17:52.478
So, um...

17:52.480 --> 17:55.414
should I get under the covers
with you?

17:56.250 --> 17:58.517
All right.

18:01.322 --> 18:03.522
(clears throat)

18:18.639 --> 18:20.873
Hello.
Hi!

18:23.677 --> 18:26.645
Why are you shaking?
Are you cold?

18:26.647 --> 18:30.115
I'm just, um... really nervous.

18:30.117 --> 18:31.583
Why?

18:31.585 --> 18:34.219
Well...

18:34.221 --> 18:36.655
I've been waiting for this
for so long,

18:36.657 --> 18:40.325
I've just... built it up
in my head.

18:40.327 --> 18:43.228
I don't know
what to expect.

18:43.230 --> 18:46.265
Neither do I.

18:46.267 --> 18:50.903
But... we can find out
together.

18:52.706 --> 18:54.907
Okay.

19:01.649 --> 19:04.816
I'm really nervous.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.085
I know.

19:07.087 --> 19:10.289
We've been waiting so long
for this.

19:10.291 --> 19:14.459
And we've built it up
in our heads so much.

19:14.461 --> 19:17.396
Guys, it's
just a movie.

19:17.398 --> 19:18.897
That's true.

19:18.899 --> 19:20.566
He's right.
It is.

19:20.568 --> 19:24.703
Although, we all
remember Jar Jar.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.307
Leonard,
I-I'm scared again.

19:33.847 --> 19:37.916
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.993
Me, too.

19:47.995 --> 19:53.198
I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

19:54.635 --> 19:56.902
That works for me.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.539
I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

20:03.344 --> 20:07.546
I don't think
I can walk right now.

20:15.634 --> 20:18.302
ARTHUR:
Uh, Sheldon?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.337
Sheldon.

20:20.339 --> 20:21.605
Arthur.

20:21.607 --> 20:22.973
What are you
doing here?

20:22.975 --> 20:24.007
I-I don't think

20:24.009 --> 20:26.643
I need any more advice.

20:26.645 --> 20:29.246
I-I was just curious.

20:30.416 --> 20:33.884
How-How'd it go?

20:33.886 --> 20:35.652
Oh.

20:38.324 --> 20:39.990
It was amazing.

20:40.759 --> 20:42.292
I-I saw it a few days later.

20:42.294 --> 20:44.595
What a movie.

20:48.767 --> 20:51.668
But, uh, what-what about Amy?

20:51.670 --> 20:54.671
Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine.

20:54.673 --> 20:59.176
But she doesn't have the history
with the franchise I do.

21:00.012 --> 21:02.512
Okay.

21:02.514 --> 21:05.082
Good... good talk.
