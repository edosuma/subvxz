Radar Control,
this is Prison Transport 9961

01:13.709 --> 01:15.428
requesting permission to land.
Over. 

01:15.468 --> 01:18.707
We've been expecting you,
PT 9961.

01:18.587 --> 01:19.667
Please confirm payload.
Over. 

01:19.707 --> 01:21.707
Crite prisoners...
eight of them. Over.

01:21.787 --> 01:24.706
There seems to be
a problem, PT 9961.

01:24.746 --> 01:27.025
My advance notice cube
states there should be

01:27.025 --> 01:30.584
10 Crite prisoners aboard your ship.
Please explain. Over.

01:30.904 --> 01:32.304
We did have 10
at one time,

01:32.784 --> 01:34.543
but the Crites were
eating everything in sight.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.503
We had to kill two of them
to make the food last longer. Over.

01:37.503 --> 01:39.622
Roger, PT 9961. 

01:39.662 --> 01:42.101
You're cleared for landing
in docking bay B.

01:42.101 --> 01:44.781
Send Crite prisoners
through detox and immunization.

01:44.781 --> 01:47.740
Put them in the termination lock
as soon as you land.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.620
Shock control will be
standing by. Over.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.179
Roger, Radar Control.

02:02.376 --> 02:04.096
This is Warden Zanti.

02:04.136 --> 02:06.655
Get Shock Control over
to the termination lock.

02:06.655 --> 02:08.414
The Crites are
up to something.

02:16.093 --> 02:18.052
Explosion in termination lock.

02:18.092 --> 02:19.812
Damage report.

02:20.172 --> 02:20.892
Two dead
and three wounded, sir.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.011
- Escapes?
- The Crites. All eight of them.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.571
The Crites have stolen a ship!

02:33.609 --> 02:34.488
Damn.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.127
Get the bounty hunters.

03:05.001 --> 03:08.000
I have a job for you.

03:14.118 --> 03:17.078
They've stolen
one of our fastest ships,

03:17.118 --> 03:20.557
with enough fuel to cross
the galaxy 10 times over.

03:20.637 --> 03:23.556
So fuel is
not their concern.

03:23.916 --> 03:26.915
However, you must stop them
before they can feed.

03:26.955 --> 03:29.714
You will receive
full payment, as usual,

03:29.794 --> 03:32.514
only upon evidence
of their destruction.

04:15.663 --> 04:18.661
CRITTERS
sincronizados por astalamina baby!

05:06.090 --> 05:08.690
Brad, April, breakfast!

05:12.249 --> 05:14.728
Brad, I need
to get in there!

05:16.728 --> 05:18.967
Come on, you little snot,
I'm in a hurry!

05:21.326 --> 05:23.766
Mom, Brad won't let me
in the bathroom!

05:25.565 --> 05:27.845
Hello?
Yeah, hold on.

05:27.885 --> 05:29.764
April, telephone!

05:30.804 --> 05:33.203
Brad, you're
a real jerk!

05:36.803 --> 05:38.802
Mom, Brad's hogging
the bathroom.

05:38.842 --> 05:39.962
Two minutes.

05:41.122 --> 05:42.961
Hello?

05:43.001 --> 05:45.041
Oh, hi.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.920
Jay, breakfast!

05:48.920 --> 05:52.239
Helen, was that
Charlie calling?

05:52.319 --> 05:54.838
No, it was Steve.

05:54.878 --> 05:56.638
Steve?

06:05.315 --> 06:07.035
Yeah?

06:07.035 --> 06:08.835
Happy birthday!

06:10.674 --> 06:12.634
Yeah?

06:12.674 --> 06:14.713
What'd you get?

06:15.993 --> 06:17.272
- No!
- Hey.

06:17.312 --> 06:19.312
Steve who?

06:19.352 --> 06:22.071
The new boy at school.

06:22.111 --> 06:24.271
Whatever happened
to what's-his-name?

06:24.271 --> 06:26.030
- Richard?
- I'm a terrible guesser.

06:26.070 --> 06:27.950
Yeah, Richard.

06:27.950 --> 06:30.269
I thought he was
the love of her life.

06:30.309 --> 06:32.029
Try and keep up,
will ya?

06:32.109 --> 06:34.748
You got to keep me informed.
Did you wash my bowling shirt?

06:34.788 --> 06:36.987
Yes, it'll be ready
for the tournament. Go eat.

06:36.987 --> 06:39.067
Brad, get Chewie
off the table.

06:42.226 --> 06:43.746
I can't wait!

06:43.786 --> 06:45.865
Have you seen
Charlie this morning, Brad?

06:46.865 --> 06:49.224
Bye.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.663
Thanks.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.663
So who is this Steve?

06:55.703 --> 06:57.222
The dork from New York.

06:57.262 --> 06:59.302
Shut up.
You're such a baby.

06:59.342 --> 07:01.701
What happened
to Richard?

07:01.741 --> 07:04.061
All Richard cared about
was hog farms.

07:04.101 --> 07:06.580
So?
My Dad farmed hogs.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.740
Dad!

07:08.780 --> 07:10.779
Brad, what are you
sitting at the table

07:10.819 --> 07:12.779
with a thermometer
in your mouth for?

07:12.818 --> 07:14.778
I'm not feeling
very good.

07:14.818 --> 07:16.458
I'll bet.

07:16.738 --> 07:20.257
- You look okay.
- 106?

07:20.257 --> 07:22.416
Did you tell Mom about your
big geometry test you have today?

07:22.456 --> 07:24.376
Shut up.
Just shut up!

07:24.456 --> 07:25.895
You have
a test today, Brad?

07:25.975 --> 07:28.255
- You're a real shithead.
- Bradley!

07:29.054 --> 07:31.614
Boy, I'm going
to wash your mouth out.

07:31.654 --> 07:34.893
Maybe you'll do as well on this
as you did on your last one.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.972
What last test?

07:39.412 --> 07:40.851
Bye.
Mmmmm.

07:40.891 --> 07:41.971
Brad!

07:42.971 --> 07:45.290
Come on, April,
we're running late!

07:45.330 --> 07:46.850
Get yourself ready
for school, boy.

07:46.890 --> 07:47.810
Dad.

07:47.850 --> 07:49.649
You miss that bus
I'm going to skin you

07:49.649 --> 07:51.249
and hang your bones
out to dry.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.487
"Thank you for the lovely breakfast
you prepared, Mother."

07:57.687 --> 08:00.447
Wonder what happened
to Charlie?

08:08.125 --> 08:09.764
Morning, Harv.

08:09.764 --> 08:12.603
Morning, Sal.
What's happening?

08:12.643 --> 08:16.443
This here says
that John Travolta

08:16.483 --> 08:18.722
used to be a waitress
in Fort Myers, Florida.

08:18.762 --> 08:22.321
What's happening
here, Sal?

08:22.401 --> 08:25.280
Big bowling tournament
tonight.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.440
And Charlie, he's sleeping
it off in the back.

08:28.480 --> 08:32.119
Be nice, Harv.
He don't mean no harm.

08:40.116 --> 08:42.116
They're coming!

08:54.873 --> 08:57.232
They're coming, Harv.

08:59.432 --> 09:02.911
Yeah. I'm getting them through
my fillings, just like last time.

09:02.951 --> 09:04.710
Cut the crap, Charlie.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.150
Listen.

09:06.150 --> 09:07.870
Jeez.

09:09.909 --> 09:12.868
They're the same ones
that ruined my pitching career.

09:12.908 --> 09:17.427
You ever consider slowing down
on the whiskey, Charlie?

09:17.467 --> 09:19.187
It ain't the whiskey.

09:19.227 --> 09:21.946
Sal.
Sal, you remember, right?

09:21.946 --> 09:25.185
I was a prospect, huh?
I wasn't drinking then, was I?

09:25.225 --> 09:28.105
Sure, Charlie, sure.
You were Major League material.

09:28.504 --> 09:30.384
Right.
I had heat.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.543
Then I started
getting these messages...

09:35.263 --> 09:39.142
This is Patrol GXP 1198

09:39.182 --> 09:41.661
calling Alpha Tango Delta.
Come in.

09:41.741 --> 09:44.460
- Over.
- Do you hear that?

09:43.701 --> 09:46.180
Charlie, it's Jeff.

09:46.220 --> 09:48.220
I'm on Route 22.
Come on, lover, pick it up.

09:51.739 --> 09:55.458
- Cut the horseshit, Jeff.
- Ooh, sorry, Harv.

09:55.498 --> 09:57.537
- I didn't know you were in.
- What do you need?

09:57.577 --> 09:59.417
Just signing off
for the night.

09:59.457 --> 10:00.776
So sign off, already.

10:05.495 --> 10:06.535
Uh, Charlie...

10:06.575 --> 10:10.214
why don't you just
go on out to Jay and Helen's?

10:10.214 --> 10:13.053
You don't want
to get fired now.

10:13.453 --> 10:15.133
Oh no.
No, I like my job.

10:15.173 --> 10:19.132
You just forget about
that Martian stuff, okay?

10:19.212 --> 10:21.131
Forget about that.

10:21.131 --> 10:23.331
Yeah, right.

10:26.410 --> 10:29.009
This town's a zoo.

10:38.407 --> 10:40.926
Prepare for holographic
transmission.

10:40.966 --> 10:43.606
In my haste
to get you on your way,

10:43.606 --> 10:46.565
there were a couple of things
I neglected to inform you of.

10:46.645 --> 10:49.044
We are tracing the Crites
to a solar system

10:49.084 --> 10:51.964
where only one planet
supports life... Earth.

10:52.043 --> 10:55.003
Your ship database will contain
adequate information

10:55.363 --> 10:57.082
on the culture
of the planet.

10:57.122 --> 10:57.722
Your transformation
capabilities

10:59.042 --> 11:00.521
should come in
quite handy there.

11:00.521 --> 11:04.480
I trust, however, you will be
less destructive this time,

11:04.520 --> 11:06.920
considering you nearly
destroyed half...

11:18.837 --> 11:21.236
Earth is a culture
of many contrasts.

11:21.236 --> 11:23.556
Their technological
advances have been...

11:28.394 --> 11:29.914
Bring him down,
bring him down!

13:22.686 --> 13:24.365
Okay.

13:24.405 --> 13:26.605
Okay, I'm ready
for that carburetor, Charlie.

13:29.284 --> 13:30.684
Charlie!

13:30.724 --> 13:32.203
Give me the carburetor!

13:32.203 --> 13:34.563
It's 5:16 at KEAT.
K-Eat in Kansas City.

13:40.241 --> 13:43.960
Okay, 1948.
A Missouri housewife is kidnapped

13:44.000 --> 13:46.920
by six little men with orange heads
on her way to the laundromat.

13:48.599 --> 13:50.119
All right!
Whoo!

13:50.159 --> 13:52.398
What the hell
was that?

13:53.398 --> 13:56.077
Did you see that?
That was the best one we ever did!

13:56.117 --> 13:58.157
Yeah, that was...
that was real good.

13:58.157 --> 14:01.316
Homemade.
Best in the state.

14:03.595 --> 14:05.755
Charlie,
you broke my slingshot.

14:05.755 --> 14:08.234
It's... I can fix this.
I can fix this.

14:08.274 --> 14:10.954
You just go get
a tin can.

14:16.232 --> 14:18.272
Anyway, like I was saying,
this housewife...

14:18.272 --> 14:19.271
What housewife?

14:19.311 --> 14:22.071
I thought I told you to get rid
of them fireworks?

14:22.151 --> 14:24.270
- You like working here, Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

14:24.310 --> 14:26.030
I've been waiting
on that carburetor.

14:26.070 --> 14:28.349
You've got to try and concentrate
on what you're doing, okay?

14:28.349 --> 14:30.149
- I'm gonna.
- I got a lot to do today,

14:30.149 --> 14:31.268
so try to keep up.

14:31.308 --> 14:33.948
- Dad, I asked if he could...
- Give me those.

14:33.988 --> 14:35.667
These are not toys.

14:35.707 --> 14:38.187
I want to try to get this thing
fired up before dark.

14:50.184 --> 14:51.743
Now what?

14:55.582 --> 14:56.662
Sorry, Charlie.

14:58.142 --> 14:59.701
That don't feel right.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.779
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, girl.

15:08.219 --> 15:11.138
Daddy, this is Steve Elliot.
I asked him to stay for dinner.

15:11.218 --> 15:13.498
I hope it's okay.
Mom said it was okay.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.777
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Brown.
- Expensive little toy.

15:16.817 --> 15:18.857
Steve's dad just gave it
to him for his birthday.

15:19.216 --> 15:20.296
It's the greatest,
isn't it?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.776
Don't look like you're going
to haul much hay in it.

15:22.816 --> 15:24.415
No...

15:24.455 --> 15:26.255
Let me... let me
just test it out.

15:33.013 --> 15:35.132
Careful, Charlie.

15:42.771 --> 15:44.650
Charlie.

15:44.690 --> 15:47.409
Bradley Brown,
I'm going to kill you.

15:51.648 --> 15:54.208
You get back here!

15:59.086 --> 16:01.246
Brad, I'm going
to kill you!

16:02.446 --> 16:04.045
Come here,
you little snot.

16:04.085 --> 16:06.045
- April!
- He shot me with a slingshot!

16:06.325 --> 16:08.084
- I did not!
- Liar!

16:08.084 --> 16:09.444
- April!
- Liar!

16:09.524 --> 16:11.683
Hold it, hold it!

16:11.723 --> 16:15.042
Boy, did you shoot your sister
with that slingshot?

16:15.042 --> 16:17.522
I think I'll stand
on the fifth amendment.

16:17.562 --> 16:20.121
This is not a democracy.
Did you or didn't you?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.479
Yeah, I guess I did.

16:28.519 --> 16:30.559
You know better
than that, boy.

16:30.599 --> 16:32.758
Go to your room.

16:34.438 --> 16:36.477
- And no supper.
- Oh, Jay.

16:36.557 --> 16:37.597
Helen.

17:12.068 --> 17:13.548
At least you like me.

17:17.507 --> 17:19.266
She's all set to go,
Mr. Brown.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.546
Okay, Charlie.
See you in the morning.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.897
This is a great meal,
Mrs. Brown.

17:57.937 --> 18:00.376
Really, one of the best
I've ever had.

18:00.416 --> 18:01.936
Thanks.
Thank you, Steve.

18:04.175 --> 18:06.734
- Well, we should get going.
- What?

18:06.774 --> 18:08.934
You promised you'd take me
for a ride, remember?

18:08.974 --> 18:11.973
I did?

18:12.933 --> 18:13.733
right.

18:13.773 --> 18:17.292
Hon, I kinda figured
you'd watch me bowl tonight.

18:17.372 --> 18:19.571
We're defending
the championship, you know.

18:19.611 --> 18:21.531
- Oh, we're...
- Maybe we'll come by later.

18:21.571 --> 18:25.490
Don't suppose anybody would like
some dessert before they leave?

18:25.890 --> 18:27.249
- No thanks, Mom.
- It was very good.

18:27.289 --> 18:28.969
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

18:32.888 --> 18:35.647
- Helen?

18:35.127 --> 18:37.967
Have you... you know,
talked to her

18:38.007 --> 18:39.966
about the way
things are?

18:39.966 --> 18:41.366
Years ago.

18:41.366 --> 18:44.285
Years?

19:01.481 --> 19:03.760
I thought you were
going to let me drive?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.600
Okay. Be careful.

19:24.635 --> 19:26.794
What do I want
to see an old barn for?

19:26.834 --> 19:29.234
Come on.
It's romantic.

19:29.274 --> 19:31.193
April...

19:31.193 --> 19:33.833
You want your car keys back,
don't you?

19:41.231 --> 19:43.910
Come on, Steve.
Want your keys?

19:49.349 --> 19:51.828
Come on!

20:28.019 --> 20:30.258
I'm allergic.

20:31.418 --> 20:32.978
Just a minute!

20:40.856 --> 20:42.535
Come in.

20:50.253 --> 20:52.853
You can thank your mama
for fixing you a plate.

20:57.332 --> 20:59.651
Where's that slingshot?

21:06.009 --> 21:08.849
Brad, why are you always
fighting with your sister?

21:08.849 --> 21:11.328
How come you and Mom
always take her side?

21:11.368 --> 21:13.927
I mean, I didn't even
do nothing!

21:13.967 --> 21:16.567
Boy, you shot her
with a slingshot.

21:19.126 --> 21:20.526
Right.

21:22.845 --> 21:25.724
Anyway, I'm confiscating
this until further notice.

21:25.804 --> 21:27.684
- But Dad...
- And no movies...

21:27.684 --> 21:28.924
for two weeks.

21:32.883 --> 21:34.802
No, uh... April...

21:37.082 --> 21:39.761
if your Dad catches me
up here I'm history.

21:39.801 --> 21:42.160
He didn't even like me
eating his food.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.399
My parents never
come out here at night.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.919
You sure?

21:50.678 --> 21:51.638
Sorry.

21:51.638 --> 21:53.278
Chewie!

23:17.057 --> 23:19.856
And now for the number one
song of the week...

23:19.896 --> 23:21.775
Johnny Steele's,
"Power of the Night."

24:06.084 --> 24:07.844
Jay?

24:07.844 --> 24:10.043
There's something wrong
with the TV!

24:29.198 --> 24:30.758
Jay?

24:37.836 --> 24:39.796
The earth moved.

24:39.836 --> 24:41.595
- Already?
- Yeah.

24:43.475 --> 24:46.634
Jay, will you forget about
the shaking? Let's go.

24:46.634 --> 24:48.913
I'm just going
to have a look.

24:48.993 --> 24:51.913
We're going to be late
for the tournament.

25:20.746 --> 25:22.825
Brad, what the hell
are you doing up there?

25:22.865 --> 25:26.144
Dad... you see... uh...

25:26.184 --> 25:28.584
the earthquake threw me
clear out of my room.

25:28.983 --> 25:29.543
I could not believe it.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.543
Cut the bull and get
your butt down here.

25:37.061 --> 25:40.061
You look like you've
done that a couple of times.

25:40.101 --> 25:41.740
- A couple times.
- Come on.

25:41.780 --> 25:43.220
I want to keep
an eye on you.

25:43.260 --> 25:45.619
- Where are we going?
- Out to the field.

25:45.619 --> 25:48.978
- Did you see that meteor?
- I saw something.

25:49.018 --> 25:52.618
Maybe it's a Russian spy probe
on some sort of secret mission.

25:52.657 --> 25:55.497
I think you watch
too much TV.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.562
Smells like oil burning.

26:52.602 --> 26:55.002
Smells like cow crap
to me, Dad.

27:12.318 --> 27:14.317
Holy shit!

27:14.317 --> 27:16.277
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

27:16.356 --> 27:18.356
What is it?

27:18.356 --> 27:22.155
Looks like
one of the herd.

27:22.155 --> 27:24.794
- What happened to him?
- I don't know.

27:26.194 --> 27:29.673
Without my gun,
I don't want to find out.

27:29.713 --> 27:31.073
Let's go.

27:32.073 --> 27:33.832
Mom's going to be
really grossed out

27:33.832 --> 27:35.872
when she hears about this.

27:35.912 --> 27:38.591
Maybe we shouldn't even
tell her about it

27:38.631 --> 27:40.870
till we find out more
about what happened out here.

27:58.626 --> 28:01.705
This is GXP 11 niner eight,

28:01.745 --> 28:04.264
come in
Alpha Tango Delta. Over.

28:04.304 --> 28:06.264
What is it, Jeff?
Over.

28:06.344 --> 28:07.904
Hey, Sal.

28:07.944 --> 28:12.342
How about we get some donuts
and coffee after work? Over.

28:12.382 --> 28:14.862
Not tonight, Jeff.
Not ever. Over.

28:14.862 --> 28:19.101
I copy, Alpha Tango Delta.
Over and out.

28:25.139 --> 28:26.899
Shit!

28:30.418 --> 28:32.737
Damn dog.

28:53.852 --> 28:55.492
Come here, poochy.

28:56.451 --> 28:59.251
Here, pooch.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.410
Come on.

29:01.370 --> 29:02.770
Come on, doggie.

29:02.770 --> 29:04.649
Come on.

29:04.689 --> 29:07.089
Bark, bark, bark.

29:07.169 --> 29:08.528
Come on.

29:09.528 --> 29:11.048
What the...?!

30:15.072 --> 30:16.751
Damn cat.

30:45.104 --> 30:47.903
Oh, you scared
the hell out of me!

30:48.303 --> 30:50.583
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. Forgive me.

30:50.743 --> 30:53.502
- Something was staring at me.
- What do you mean something?

30:53.582 --> 30:56.221
- Where?
- Over there by the window.

31:10.858 --> 31:13.857
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe it was Chewie.

31:14.097 --> 31:15.736
Yeah, maybe.

31:16.736 --> 31:18.736
Did you find anything?

31:20.135 --> 31:23.375
Yeah, we found something
a little strange.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.894
Jay?

31:39.570 --> 31:40.530
Transform.

31:41.570 --> 31:42.930
Nothing likes me.

31:43.010 --> 31:45.529
Find something.

32:09.443 --> 32:11.282
Eating start.

32:42.035 --> 32:43.874
Who are you calling?

32:43.874 --> 32:47.273
Harv. I want to tell him
what's going on out here.

32:47.353 --> 32:49.673
Maybe he's gotten
other calls.

33:04.869 --> 33:05.949
This phone is dead.

33:05.989 --> 33:07.748
What?

33:15.626 --> 33:17.146
Mom?

33:17.186 --> 33:19.025
Okay.

33:24.704 --> 33:27.903
There's no reason for you to
come down here. Just wait a minute.

33:27.943 --> 33:31.102
Probably just a circuit
breaker's been tripped.

33:45.979 --> 33:46.539
What the...?

34:05.494 --> 34:06.654
Jay, any luck?

34:07.733 --> 34:08.893
Just a minute.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.080
What's wrong?

35:04.839 --> 35:05.679
Dad!

35:05.719 --> 35:08.118
- Stay upstairs!
- Mom, we got to help him!

35:28.073 --> 35:30.592
- Bradley!
- No, no, don't come down here!

35:51.627 --> 35:52.667
Jay, come on!

35:52.707 --> 35:54.227
What's down there?

35:54.307 --> 35:57.026
I don't know.
Something meaner than hell.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.259
Jeff, come in, Jeff.
Over.

36:26.099 --> 36:28.818
This is Alpha Tango Delta

36:28.858 --> 36:31.817
calling GXP
11 niner eight.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.177
Come in.
Over.

36:35.536 --> 36:38.935
Come on, will you quit fooling
around and answer me? Over.

36:47.573 --> 36:51.572
All right, I'm sorry
about the donuts and coffee.

36:51.652 --> 36:55.051
Maybe another time, but tonight
I have to wash my hair.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.771
Over.

37:01.650 --> 37:04.009
Come on, Jeff.

37:04.049 --> 37:07.208
I've been getting all sorts of calls
about UFOs in the area.

37:07.248 --> 37:11.367
Carla Emmons swears
one nearly ran into her house

37:10.567 --> 37:12.167
and then went flying off.

37:12.207 --> 37:14.886
I think she's been dipping
in the cooking sherry again.

37:16.006 --> 37:19.245
Anyway, she wants you to get
over there right away. Over.

37:22.484 --> 37:25.284
I am starting to lose
my patience, Jeff.

37:25.324 --> 37:27.883
If you are sleeping on
the job again, I am not going...

37:51.197 --> 37:52.917
I can't feel that.

38:03.674 --> 38:05.834
Hey, careful, boy.

38:05.874 --> 38:08.313
That's some kind
of poison.

38:08.913 --> 38:10.472
That's better, babe.

38:10.832 --> 38:12.552
I'm beginning to get
the feeling back.

38:25.589 --> 38:27.148
I'll get it.

38:42.224 --> 38:42.864
Steve!

38:46.743 --> 38:48.023
Steve!

39:05.219 --> 39:06.578
Who's that?

39:06.578 --> 39:07.658
April!

39:07.778 --> 39:09.138
April?

39:21.734 --> 39:22.974
Brad!

39:24.654 --> 39:26.573
April?

39:26.573 --> 39:28.693
Brad! Brad, help!

39:30.012 --> 39:30.812
Hurry up!

39:33.052 --> 39:34.411
Do something, Brad!

39:37.491 --> 39:39.530
Brad!

39:45.249 --> 39:46.288
Brad!

40:13.242 --> 40:15.641
- Brad!
- Mom!

40:15.641 --> 40:19.320
- What? What are you...
- Steve's dead!

40:25.119 --> 40:27.078
Charlie?

40:27.118 --> 40:28.958
- Call Harv.
- What for?

40:29.038 --> 40:31.797
Call Harv.
Call.

40:31.837 --> 40:34.276
Call the army.
They're here.

40:36.196 --> 40:37.236
- Who?
- Who?!

40:37.276 --> 40:39.715
Them!
My teeth.

40:39.755 --> 40:42.754
Sally, call Harv, please?

40:42.794 --> 40:45.074
Charlie...

40:46.153 --> 40:47.393
I want to go home.

40:47.593 --> 40:50.992
Okay.
Just... where is he?

40:51.032 --> 40:52.632
Might be
at the bowling alley.

40:52.672 --> 40:55.711
Okay, good, good.
I'll get Harv.

40:55.751 --> 40:57.870
- You call the army.
- Okay.

41:05.708 --> 41:08.628
Thank you, Ms. Grubner.

41:08.668 --> 41:10.947
Tonight...

41:10.987 --> 41:13.946
I would like to read to you
from the book of Genesis.

41:13.986 --> 41:17.146
Chapter 19...
which, as most of you know,

41:17.186 --> 41:20.225
is the story
of Sodom and Gomorrah.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.862
Obviously, some
of our citizens are...

41:53.256 --> 41:55.016
We're here for the Crites.

42:03.614 --> 42:06.653
The county is going
to pay for this, Jeff.

42:11.012 --> 42:12.412
Jeff?

42:14.931 --> 42:16.931
Jeff?

42:26.128 --> 42:27.208
Jeff Barnes?

43:25.953 --> 43:27.473
Jay.

43:29.472 --> 43:30.792
Jay, what are you doing?

43:35.271 --> 43:37.390
Maybe we ought to just
stay put.

43:37.390 --> 43:39.350
They haven't gotten
into the house yet.

43:39.390 --> 43:41.029
They will.

43:41.029 --> 43:44.429
We could board up the place.
We could make it stronger.

43:44.469 --> 43:46.988
Helen, these things
are vicious.

43:47.028 --> 43:50.147
They've cut out our phone,
they've cut out our power.

43:49.587 --> 43:51.267
You understand
what that means?

43:51.307 --> 43:54.066
It's just a matter of time
until they get in here.

43:54.106 --> 43:55.946
Yeah, but we should
just stay here.

43:55.986 --> 43:57.905
No, we can't wait.

44:08.063 --> 44:09.782
Wait up, Brad.

44:13.061 --> 44:14.821
All right, Jay,
I've got her.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.060
Okay, let's go.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.500
Stay together.

44:28.298 --> 44:30.297
I'm going to drive, Jay.

44:30.297 --> 44:32.057
Okay, baby.

44:37.335 --> 44:39.375
Come on.

44:40.335 --> 44:42.054
Oh my God, Jay.

44:42.094 --> 44:44.374
- Oh, Mom.
- What the hell are those things?

44:44.374 --> 44:47.133
They're from outer space,
like Charlie says.

44:47.493 --> 44:48.293
Bradley.

44:47.693 --> 44:50.252
Maybe they're some government
experiment gone haywire.

44:50.332 --> 44:53.451
They used to be gophers,
but got zapped by some radioactive...

44:53.491 --> 44:55.651
- Bradley!
- What are we going to do now?

44:56.091 --> 44:58.170
Steve's keys.

44:58.250 --> 45:00.250
Oh God.
Wait!

45:03.889 --> 45:05.568
Stay together.

45:05.968 --> 45:07.168
Come on, come on.

45:27.443 --> 45:28.922
Go on!

45:34.481 --> 45:35.721
They're getting bigger!

45:39.400 --> 45:42.119
Come on, faster!
Faster!

45:51.837 --> 45:52.876
It's locked!

45:52.916 --> 45:54.196
Come on!

45:58.115 --> 45:59.315
Go! Get in!

46:06.473 --> 46:07.473
Jay!

46:21.389 --> 46:21.909
Brad!

46:41.184 --> 46:43.384
Get him up to the door.

46:43.424 --> 46:45.423
Get your feet up, Jay!

46:48.382 --> 46:49.982
Mom, shoot!

46:50.342 --> 46:52.421
I can't!
It must be empty!

46:52.861 --> 46:54.941
My pocket.
My shirt pocket!

46:54.981 --> 46:56.500
Get them. Hurry.

47:49.007 --> 47:50.607
- Well?
- The line's busy.

47:50.647 --> 47:52.646
I don't get it.
Jay's never this late.

47:52.846 --> 47:55.326
- Except when he pays for the beer.
- Yeah.

47:55.366 --> 47:58.245
Jake, they are coming.

47:58.285 --> 48:01.004
They are not only coming,
they are here.

48:01.164 --> 48:03.124
See, I was out
on Route 22...

48:03.164 --> 48:07.043
- and I looked up...
- Have another drink, Charlie.

48:08.922 --> 48:10.962
I don't want
another drink, Jake.

48:12.561 --> 48:15.081
I want Harv.
We're under attack.

48:15.161 --> 48:17.320
I'm going to leave it
right here.

48:17.360 --> 48:20.479
Just don't bother me
any more.

48:21.439 --> 48:23.479
I saw the sign was shaking
and everything.

48:33.476 --> 48:37.355
- Isn't that Johnny Steele?
- I don't know.

48:44.553 --> 48:46.193
Whoa!

48:56.430 --> 48:58.350
Joe, let's go.

49:43.338 --> 49:44.698
Holy shit!

49:46.098 --> 49:47.937
Wonder what team
he's on?

49:59.654 --> 50:02.414
Hey, Jake, are we gonna get
a couple beers over here or what?

50:02.414 --> 50:04.693
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

50:04.733 --> 50:06.973
I got a problem here.

50:09.252 --> 50:11.092
You believe these guys?

50:12.691 --> 50:14.491
It ain't Halloween, is it?

50:17.450 --> 50:21.929
If anything does happen to me,
you crooks won't live long.

50:21.969 --> 50:25.088
What does he mean
we won't live long?

50:26.768 --> 50:28.687
What can I get
for you fellas?

50:28.727 --> 50:31.166
Reverend, what are
you doing here?

50:31.166 --> 50:33.046
That's some outfit
you got on.

50:33.046 --> 50:35.485
- We want the Crites.
- Oh really?

50:35.525 --> 50:38.165
Who are they,
some new team?

50:41.404 --> 50:42.484
The Crites.

50:42.524 --> 50:44.443
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

50:48.482 --> 50:51.161
I think you all
better be leaving

50:51.201 --> 50:52.721
before somebody
gets hurt.

51:01.439 --> 51:04.198
You all have
a serious attitude problem.

51:06.078 --> 51:07.397
Keep your shirt on,
asshole.

52:00.904 --> 52:02.823
This had better
be important.

52:02.863 --> 52:05.343
Harv, you better get
down to the church,

52:04.703 --> 52:06.743
- all hell is breaking loose.
- What?

52:06.822 --> 52:09.262
The reverend says
a couple of guys started shooting...

52:09.342 --> 52:11.261
Whoa, slow down.

52:11.301 --> 52:12.941
...destroyed the organ,
you know how beautiful...

52:12.981 --> 52:14.980
- Where's Jeff?
- I don't know.

52:15.020 --> 52:16.980
I've been trying
to get him for hours.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.259
Give me 10 minutes.

52:40.454 --> 52:42.054
He looks pretty sick, Mom.

52:43.333 --> 52:44.493
I'm okay, sport.

52:44.533 --> 52:45.813
He's fine.

52:47.172 --> 52:48.772
He doesn't look
fine to me.

52:48.812 --> 52:51.451
Why don't you go
check the windows?

52:50.771 --> 52:53.331
- I already did.
- Check them again!

53:04.408 --> 53:06.008
It's okay, Mom.

53:06.048 --> 53:08.367
I'm so sorry.

53:26.403 --> 53:28.042
April?

53:28.082 --> 53:30.122
Yeah?

53:30.162 --> 53:32.961
You okay?

53:37.880 --> 53:39.639
The flue's open!

53:52.276 --> 53:53.636
Mom!

54:09.232 --> 54:11.511
The shotgun!

54:50.461 --> 54:51.221
Brad!
Brad, look out!

55:17.935 --> 55:19.454
Hey, hey!

55:19.534 --> 55:21.014
Hey, hey!

55:22.054 --> 55:24.213
I've been looking
for you guys!

55:24.213 --> 55:25.973
I just want to talk
to you.

55:27.012 --> 55:29.612
- At first he was Jeff.
- Was it Jeff or wasn't it?

55:29.652 --> 55:31.731
- He changed.
- Changed?

55:31.971 --> 55:33.731
They were wearing
really funny clothes.

55:34.130 --> 55:35.330
Like they was
from Los Angeles.

55:35.330 --> 55:38.529
- Everybody calm down.
- Harv, all hell is breaking loose.

55:38.569 --> 55:41.649
- Yeah, Sal. Over.
- There's been a disturbance

55:41.689 --> 55:44.568
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

55:43.928 --> 55:46.647
What kind
of a disturbance? Over.

55:45.888 --> 55:49.127
Well...

55:49.567 --> 55:52.166
evidently some guys
shot up the bar.

55:53.965 --> 55:55.725
You get a description?
Over.

55:55.765 --> 55:58.324
Well...

55:58.404 --> 56:01.684
it's kind of strange, Harv,
but Jake says

56:01.684 --> 56:05.403
it was Reverend Miller
and Charlie

56:05.443 --> 56:07.162
and some stranger.

56:07.202 --> 56:09.322
Hold it, hold it,
hold it.

56:09.362 --> 56:11.441
I'm not reading you
clear, Sal.

56:11.521 --> 56:13.001
Repeat that. Over.

56:13.041 --> 56:15.280
Reverend Miller,
Charlie McFadden

56:15.320 --> 56:18.479
and some stranger
just shot up the bar

56:18.519 --> 56:21.599
at the Bowlarama Lanes. Over.

56:20.919 --> 56:23.758
Have you heard
from Jeff? Over.

56:23.798 --> 56:26.637
I can't raise him, Harv.

56:26.677 --> 56:30.756
I also got a report here

56:29.916 --> 56:32.356
about shots fired
out Route 22...

56:32.396 --> 56:34.555
near the Brown place. Over.

56:34.595 --> 56:37.794
Harv, do you read? Over.

56:38.234 --> 56:40.674
Sal, I want you to keep
trying to raise Jeff.

56:40.714 --> 56:42.753
I'm headed over
to the bowling alley.

56:42.793 --> 56:45.113
Then I'm going to head out
towards the Brown's place.

56:45.113 --> 56:46.392
Over and out.

56:46.472 --> 56:47.832
Over and out.

56:58.669 --> 57:00.349
Get 'em, Harv!

57:04.428 --> 57:07.467
Babe, I got to get to a phone,
get some help out here.

57:09.667 --> 57:11.466
I can do it.

57:11.506 --> 57:14.305
- Absolutely not.
- Dad, you can't even walk.

57:19.185 --> 57:21.184
I'm so tired.

57:25.543 --> 57:27.263
Damn.

57:29.382 --> 57:31.621
Son...

57:31.701 --> 57:34.421
assuming I said okay,
how would you do it?

57:34.421 --> 57:37.140
Hit the yard, grab my bike
and head for the highway.

57:37.140 --> 57:40.819
Dad, somebody's got
to go for help.

57:40.819 --> 57:42.859
All right.

57:43.259 --> 57:46.578
But boy, you ride like
you never rode before.

57:46.018 --> 57:48.337
You get over to the Emmons' house
and get on the phone.

57:48.377 --> 57:50.857
- Get Harv over here.
- Dad, I'll be fine.

57:51.297 --> 57:52.096
Don't worry.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.896
You want to take this?

57:55.735 --> 57:57.975
Nah, you keep it.

57:58.015 --> 58:00.174
It'd just slow me down.

58:00.534 --> 58:01.414
Anyway, you might need it.

58:20.049 --> 58:21.849
Brad?

58:23.488 --> 58:25.328
See ya.

59:39.509 --> 59:41.149
Oh my gosh.

59:41.149 --> 59:43.308
They're growing!

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.900
How ya feeling, hon?

01:00:20.299 --> 01:00:22.219
Like a brick hit me.

01:00:24.578 --> 01:00:25.818
Oh, baby.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:31.336
How long have I been...?

01:00:33.256 --> 01:00:34.975
Where's Brad?

01:00:35.795 --> 01:00:38.355
Brad has gone
to get help.

01:00:38.395 --> 01:00:42.194
Oh, Jay, you shouldn't
have let him go.

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.780
Stop, stop!
Wait!

01:01:43.218 --> 01:01:45.978
Go, just go.
These things... these critters.

01:01:45.978 --> 01:01:47.897
Come on, go!

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:50.456
Dad's all torn up and Mom's got
a harpoon thing in her neck.

01:01:50.496 --> 01:01:51.536
They're getting
bigger.

01:01:52.696 --> 01:01:54.695
Let's go!

01:01:54.775 --> 01:01:56.775
Charlie?

01:01:58.095 --> 01:02:00.214
Where's Jeff?

01:02:02.014 --> 01:02:03.493
Hey, you're Johnny Steele.

01:02:03.533 --> 01:02:05.733
- Where?
- Huh?

01:02:05.813 --> 01:02:07.852
Where are they?

01:02:08.212 --> 01:02:09.492
At my house.
Come on, hit it.

01:02:13.811 --> 01:02:16.010
Where?

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:18.129
Charlie, you know
where my house is.

01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:22.048
Who are you guys?

01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:26.167
We want the Crites.

01:02:26.047 --> 01:02:27.207
The Crites?

01:02:27.247 --> 01:02:29.687
Critters,
Crites.

01:02:31.366 --> 01:02:33.246
You're not from
around here, are you?

01:02:33.326 --> 01:02:36.965
Okay, okay.
You help me, I help you.

01:02:59.959 --> 01:03:00.919
Stop it!

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:08.237
Goddamn it, stop it!

01:03:17.515 --> 01:03:18.834
I got one.

01:03:41.189 --> 01:03:42.628
Get out of my house!

01:03:44.788 --> 01:03:48.187
Damn it!
Give me some more rounds.

01:03:48.587 --> 01:03:49.347
That's it.

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:50.946
Oh, Jay.

01:04:24.258 --> 01:04:26.457
Holy...

01:04:30.336 --> 01:04:32.696
Mom? Dad?

01:04:32.896 --> 01:04:34.615
Are you all right?

01:04:34.695 --> 01:04:37.455
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:38.534
Brad, who did you bring?

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.374
Charlie
and Johnny Steele.

01:04:40.374 --> 01:04:41.933
- Who?
- Go on!

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:46.332
Help us!

01:04:46.372 --> 01:04:47.892
Oh God, Chewie!

01:04:49.212 --> 01:04:51.571
Help us!
Help us!

01:04:51.611 --> 01:04:54.050
Oh, it's Harv.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.850
Holy shit!
What is that, a cannon?

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:57.689
What's going on here?

01:04:57.849 --> 01:04:59.489
Brad.
Where's Brad?

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:01.648
He's still in the house.

01:05:01.688 --> 01:05:03.888
Helen, Helen!
Helen, Helen, Helen!

01:05:03.888 --> 01:05:05.647
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:07.127
Get in there.
Get in.

01:05:07.127 --> 01:05:08.887
Jay, get in the car.

01:05:32.481 --> 01:05:33.600
Watch it!

01:06:04.033 --> 01:06:06.112
Jeez, these folks could use
a good exterminator.

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:10.951
Charlie, what do you think
you're doing?

01:06:15.110 --> 01:06:17.110
You drunk?

01:06:22.628 --> 01:06:24.628
I hope not you'll
take over our operation.

01:06:24.668 --> 01:06:26.587
Charlie, put me down.

01:06:37.904 --> 01:06:40.664
Harv...
are you okay?

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:43.263
I swallowed
my chewing tobacco.

01:06:57.099 --> 01:06:58.939
Chewie.

01:07:01.498 --> 01:07:03.738
Here, Chewie.

01:07:17.254 --> 01:07:19.294
Chewie.

01:07:19.374 --> 01:07:20.694
Come here.

01:07:29.131 --> 01:07:30.771
Chewie.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.490
Where've you been?
I've been looking all over for you.

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:38.649
Come on.
We're going for a ride.

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:41.088
Brad, get down here!

01:07:46.007 --> 01:07:48.047
Brad!

01:07:56.645 --> 01:07:58.004
Help!

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:16.520
Thanks.

01:08:19.839 --> 01:08:22.118
Oh, no.

01:08:22.158 --> 01:08:24.358
April!

01:08:28.077 --> 01:08:29.716
No, Helen, no!

01:08:29.756 --> 01:08:30.796
No!

01:08:32.076 --> 01:08:33.234
Where's April?

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:36.674
It just grabbed her.
I couldn't...

01:08:36.714 --> 01:08:38.714
It was huge.

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:40.554
- Come on, Harv.
- They took her that way.

01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:44.353
What was that thing?

01:08:51.191 --> 01:08:52.430
Charlie?

01:09:03.508 --> 01:09:04.468
Brad!

01:09:07.067 --> 01:09:09.066
Brad!

01:09:09.106 --> 01:09:10.666
No! You get him!

01:09:10.706 --> 01:09:12.865
Get him!

01:10:19.369 --> 01:10:21.368
- Charlie?
- Brad.

01:10:21.408 --> 01:10:22.888
I was right.
I was right!

01:10:22.928 --> 01:10:25.607
What are you doing here?

01:10:25.647 --> 01:10:27.127
I'm just following
my teeth.

01:10:27.167 --> 01:10:29.806
- I'm getting signals like crazy.
- Come on.

01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:31.686
Where are we going?

01:10:42.763 --> 01:10:44.842
- What the heck...
- Shhh!

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:48.201
Brad, is that April?

01:10:59.919 --> 01:11:01.198
- Stay down, Brad.
- Stay here.

01:11:01.238 --> 01:11:03.358
If I need you,
I'll holler.

01:11:03.398 --> 01:11:04.837
Brad...

01:11:04.917 --> 01:11:06.597
What's that thing
going to do with April?

01:11:06.677 --> 01:11:08.796
- It's going to kill her.
- Oh, it's going to kill her.

01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:10.236
Kill her?!

01:11:11.996 --> 01:11:13.755
Bradley!

01:11:51.786 --> 01:11:52.705
Let's go.

01:12:38.414 --> 01:12:39.813
Brad!

01:12:40.813 --> 01:12:41.933
April?

01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:51.730
Give me your hand!

01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:58.329
- I dropped my firecracker!
- Forget it!

01:12:58.369 --> 01:12:59.888
But they'll get away!

01:13:03.048 --> 01:13:04.887
- Charlie, let's go!
- Come on!

01:13:04.927 --> 01:13:07.806
Brad, I got an idea.
Come here!

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:09.326
- Give me your fire.
- Brad!

01:13:09.366 --> 01:13:11.965
Brad, come on!

01:13:12.925 --> 01:13:14.925
Come on!

01:13:19.643 --> 01:13:21.643
Throw it!

01:13:42.998 --> 01:13:44.477
Dad!

01:13:46.237 --> 01:13:48.516
- Mom, Dad!
- Are you okay?

01:13:48.516 --> 01:13:50.116
Yeah, we're okay.

01:14:47.701 --> 01:14:49.861
Hey!

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.739
I, uh...
just wanted, you know...

01:14:56.099 --> 01:14:57.899
to say thanks.

01:15:06.977 --> 01:15:09.016
Call me.

01:15:17.414 --> 01:15:19.333
listen, you wouldn't
happen to have

01:15:19.373 --> 01:15:21.573
another one of them
electronic gizmos

01:15:21.613 --> 01:15:23.452
like you gave
to Brad there?

01:15:23.492 --> 01:15:25.412
Listen, maybe you need
a good mechanic

01:15:25.452 --> 01:15:26.892
to work
on them guns there.

01:15:26.892 --> 01:15:28.371
I'm real good
with my hands...

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:52.910
Chewie!

01:17:27.141 --> 01:17:29.261
Chewie?

01:17:36.339 --> 01:17:38.618
Chew.
