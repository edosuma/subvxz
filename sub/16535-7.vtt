WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.369
.

00:01.402 --> 00:02.270
- 'Cause Diego's got
a cross-country meet,

00:03.836 --> 00:05.806
and the nanny's got a class
and can't take him.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.076
How do you not know this?

00:08.109 --> 00:11.545
No, Eva's in SAT prep.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.248
Laura, Laura, Laura.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.816
[sighs] Fine.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.585
I'll call Gabby,
see if she can cover.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.353
Yeah.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.155
[telephone receiver clattering]

00:24.525 --> 00:27.595
Wrong number.
- [chuckles]

00:27.628 --> 00:31.832
Things aren't going so great
with your ex, huh?

00:31.865 --> 00:35.369
- She's seeing some guy.
He's older, rich.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.371
They travel a lot.

00:37.405 --> 00:41.309
She's basically checked out,
mom-wise.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.576
- Sorry, man.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.412
- Homicide--
Senour and Archer.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.480
ASA Stone wants us there.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.483
[dramatic music]

00:49.517 --> 00:51.119
*

00:51.152 --> 00:54.155
- Thank you.
- Uh, Tariq Bolad--

00:54.188 --> 00:55.689
two gunshot wounds,
center mass,

00:55.723 --> 00:58.159
wallet and keys still on him
but no cell phone.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.127
- Who called it in?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.395
- Shot Spotter
picked up possible gunfire.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.663
Dispatch put it over the zone.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.364
We were first on the scene.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.367
[camera shutter clicking]

01:06.400 --> 01:09.270
[indistinct chatter]

01:09.303 --> 01:10.571
- Is ASA Stone around?

01:10.604 --> 01:15.676
*

01:15.709 --> 01:18.512
- The Ariel Kincaid murder.
You remember it?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.613
- Yeah, I do.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.182
It was two years ago.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.184
She was raped, tortured.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.386
They dumped her body
in the locks by Navy Pier.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.355
Some rich kid did it.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.257
- Oliver Tuxhorn.
- Yeah.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.159
That little prick--
he's a person of interest

01:31.192 --> 01:32.193
in another rape, right?

01:32.226 --> 01:34.695
- Four.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.963
- So what about him?

01:35.996 --> 01:38.399
- I started opening arguments
against Tuxhorn this morning.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.301
Tariq was my only eyewitness,

01:40.334 --> 01:41.469
but we're not screwed

01:41.502 --> 01:43.704
if you can link him
to Tariq's murder.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.473
Tariq's grand jury testimony
will stand.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.741
It's called
"forfeiture by wrongdoing."

01:47.775 --> 01:49.643
Tuxhorn can't benefit
from the shooting

01:49.677 --> 01:51.479
if we can prove
he was responsible for it.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.214
- We'll make the link.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.315
- Please do.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.917
If you don't, a serial rapist
and murderer walks.

01:56.950 --> 02:04.225

Advertise your product or brand here

02:20.774 --> 02:22.576
- Tariq had been here
ten years--

02:22.610 --> 02:25.879
originally from Sudan,
married, kid on the way.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.550
Employed as a supervisor
in an office-cleaning company.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.952
He was working on his degree
nights at UIC.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.821
- Wasn't he in protective
custody for the trial?

02:33.854 --> 02:36.557
- He was. Head of the detail
is on his way in now.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.259
- You know,
the original case file

02:38.292 --> 02:42.763
indicates that Tuxhorn and Ariel
left the Tiki on Rush at 10:45.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.798
Now, Tuxhorn says that
they went to his apartment,

02:44.832 --> 02:46.900
they had consensual B&D sex,

02:46.934 --> 02:48.769
and then she walked out
on her own.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.871
Tariq's statement
says that he saw Tuxhorn

02:50.904 --> 02:53.274
dragging Ariel's body towards
the locks where he dumped her

02:53.307 --> 02:54.675
and he drove off.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.610
He called 911,
he went in after her,

02:56.644 --> 02:57.711
she was already dead.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.979
And the M.E.'s
toxicology report

02:59.012 --> 03:00.881
determined she was
loaded up with ketamine.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.683
- Four other girls have made
rape allegations

03:02.716 --> 03:03.751
against Tuxhorn.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.887
He skated on each case,
combo of his daddy's money

03:06.920 --> 03:09.657
and his high-powered attorney,
Dominick Cooke.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.658
He's the worst.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.925
- Tariq's phone records?

03:11.959 --> 03:13.927
- I'm into it
with the service provider.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.564
Subpoena's been drafted,
signed off on, and dropped.

03:16.597 --> 03:17.865
So we should have it
in a few hours.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.968
- Yeah, well, we got one really
big question to answer first.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.871
Tariq Bolad's identity
was supposed to be sealed.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.673
[telephone rings]
Check into the grand jury,

03:25.706 --> 03:27.341
court reporters, ASA's office,

03:27.375 --> 03:29.977
whoever had access to his name
or a motive to leak it,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.579
'cause somebody figured it out.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.314
- Ken Amis, the head
of Tariq's security detail,

03:33.347 --> 03:34.715
is on his way up.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.817
- Al, you and me.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.587
- You never met a more humble,

03:39.620 --> 03:41.889
more genuine guy in your life
than Tariq.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.424
He'd say how much
this country gave him,

03:43.457 --> 03:45.259
and he wanted to give back--

03:45.293 --> 03:47.295
stuff people
don't say anymore.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.796
- How long you been
assigned to him?

03:48.829 --> 03:51.799
- Two weeks. Me, Danny Hearst,
and Todd Peterson.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.766
- Who else knew
you were guarding him?

03:52.800 --> 03:56.704
- Just ASA Stone
and his second chair, Valdez.

03:56.737 --> 04:01.342
- So what happened
last night?

04:01.375 --> 04:04.812
- We had him
at the Best Western O'Hare.

04:04.845 --> 04:07.748
He's his normal self.
We're watching "House Hunters."

04:07.781 --> 04:09.983
He goes in his room,
and he's in there for a while,

04:10.017 --> 04:11.985
and I walk by, and he's sitting
on the edge of his bed

04:12.019 --> 04:14.455
with his cell phone in his hand,
dead quiet.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.690
I ask if he's okay,
and he says it was

04:16.724 --> 04:19.327
just the stress of the trial
starting the next day.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.329
And he went to the gym.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.796
Um...

04:22.830 --> 04:25.633
more than a half hour goes by,
40 minutes.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.335
I call Danny, who's on
the gym's front door,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.470
but Tariq must've slipped out
the back door by the bathroom.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.004
- Hmm.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.941
- Tariq got a call or a text
from somebody,

04:33.974 --> 04:35.343
and it was something
that bothered him.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.411
That was my gut.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.447
- That helps. Thanks.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.715
Yeah, we're gonna need the
information on the other two

04:41.749 --> 04:44.051
who were watching Tariq.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.720
- So you can look into us?

04:46.754 --> 04:47.955
- You know how it works.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.057
- This is wasted time.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.892
Me and my team
didn't do anything wrong.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.861
- Except lose your guy.

04:53.894 --> 04:59.700
*

04:59.733 --> 05:03.804
- Hey. Um, Tariq Bolad's wife--
widow--is, um, downstairs.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.773
- I'll go.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.111
Hey.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.914
- So how's the new partner?

05:13.947 --> 05:16.049
- He's a knucklehead.
- Ouch.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.885
[chuckles]
All right.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.892
- Hey, Burgess.
- Yeah?

05:24.925 --> 05:25.926
- One day...

05:25.959 --> 05:26.960
- Yeah.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.029
[chuckles]
Right.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.500
[mugs clink]

05:33.967 --> 05:37.438
- Mrs. Bolad?

05:37.471 --> 05:39.940
I'm--I'm
Detective Erin Lindsay.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.943
*

05:42.976 --> 05:44.945
I'm so sorry.

05:44.978 --> 05:48.482
*

05:48.516 --> 05:50.818
- You, um--

05:50.851 --> 05:52.720
you have no idea
what Tariq went through

05:52.753 --> 05:54.788
to get to this country--

05:54.822 --> 05:58.426
what he witnessed,
what he endured.

05:58.459 --> 06:02.396
And after all that,
to be killed here...

06:02.430 --> 06:08.802
*

06:10.203 --> 06:12.740
- [sighs]

06:12.773 --> 06:16.477
Were you in communication
with Tariq last night at all?

06:16.510 --> 06:18.178
- [sniffles]

06:18.211 --> 06:20.981
Just a couple texts,
saying that I loved him

06:21.014 --> 06:23.150
and I was proud of him.

06:23.183 --> 06:28.055
- Did he seemed worried
or agitated lately?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.990
- No.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.025
I mean, I was.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.862
- Why?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.964
- We were being followed--

06:36.997 --> 06:39.132
starting about a month ago.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.869
It would be a different car
each time.

06:41.902 --> 06:46.206
- Did you mention this to
the State's Attorney's office?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.875
- I did--

06:47.908 --> 06:52.012
to Mr. Stone's investigators.

06:52.045 --> 06:56.049
They looked into it, but didn't
find anything credible.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.487
But they put police officers
in front of our house.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.990
And that's when Tariq
went into full protection

07:03.023 --> 07:06.627
and I went to stay
with my parents.

07:06.660 --> 07:10.498
It's the Tuxhorn kid
who paid to have Tariq killed.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.632
I mean...

07:11.665 --> 07:13.166
Or his dad.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.869
Who else could it be?

07:15.903 --> 07:17.871
- We will find out.

07:17.905 --> 07:24.912
*

07:26.013 --> 07:28.181
- Any objection
to the state's motion

07:28.215 --> 07:30.183
for continuance, Mr. Cooke?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.520
- Not if the court
will reconsider bail.

07:32.553 --> 07:36.056
- Bail? The Tuxhorn family
has unlimited resources,

07:36.089 --> 07:38.058
not to mention hotels
all over the world.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.192
If Mr. Tuxhorn is released--

07:39.226 --> 07:40.994
- The prosecution
just admitted

07:41.028 --> 07:42.896
their case is a featherweight
without a witness.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.532
I understand you're going
to give them a continuance,

07:44.565 --> 07:46.900
Your Honor, but my client
shouldn't have to wait it out

07:46.934 --> 07:48.869
in jail if the state
can't make its case.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.938
- The state can't make
its case because the defendant

07:50.971 --> 07:52.606
may have arranged to have
a witness to be killed.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.207
- Uh, if Mr. Stone
had proof of that,

07:54.241 --> 07:56.076
we'd be in a separate courtroom
with new charges.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.645
If he'd prefer to
discuss dismissal--

07:57.678 --> 07:58.612
- No shot.

07:58.646 --> 08:01.882
- Mr. Tuxhorn
will surrender his passport.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.084
Bail is set at $2 million...
[observers murmuring]

08:04.117 --> 08:07.888
And state's motion
for continuance is granted.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.991
Other motions?
- Nope.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.960
[gavel bangs]
- We love you, Oliver!

08:12.993 --> 08:15.563
[indistinct chatter]
- Okay.

08:15.596 --> 08:22.603
*

08:31.945 --> 08:33.513
Wait here.
- Yeah.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.116
- That's an easy way to make
600 bucks, give or take.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.886
- Oh, you have an interest
in this case, Detective?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.154
- I want to talk
to your client.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.157
- I want to play first base
for the Cubs.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.560
- He doesn't want
to clear his name?

08:46.594 --> 08:47.494
- I'll be in contact.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.663
Now, will you excuse us,
or do I need to call

08:49.697 --> 08:51.965
one of those
fine Cook County sheriffs over?

08:51.999 --> 08:54.334
- Hmm.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.606
- I saw you in court.
Thank you for your support.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.141
- Enjoy your freedom,
douche bag.

09:01.174 --> 09:04.011
You're not gonna
have it for long.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.213
- Oliver, let's go.

09:16.890 --> 09:17.024
.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.025
- Checked into Tuxhorn's
visitor list from lockup.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.994
Mail, phone, and visitor logs

09:21.028 --> 09:22.796
show only his attorney
and his family

09:22.830 --> 09:23.764
having any contact with him.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.966
- I want you to add
Tuxhorn's family members

09:27.768 --> 09:28.669
I want a complete workup
of all their financials,

09:30.137 --> 09:31.972
specifically
any large-sum withdrawal

09:32.005 --> 09:33.874
in the last two months or so.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.677
Hey, Stone asked he be kept
in the loop as much as possible.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.078
- I don't think I've ever
disliked someone

09:38.111 --> 09:40.748
so quickly or so intensely.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.049
- So tell me, heading down
to the courthouse,

09:42.082 --> 09:43.383
what did that accomplish?

09:43.416 --> 09:45.719
- I got to look in his eyes.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.887
Isn't that
what you always say--

09:46.920 --> 09:48.388
"I look in people's eyes
for a living"?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.390
- Fair enough.
What'd you see?

09:50.423 --> 09:53.326
- He is responsible for
Tariq's murder, no question.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.427
- Okay.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.931
Just make sure you don't let
this guy get in your head.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.132
- Hey, Sarge?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.868
Tariq's cell phone dump
came back in.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.737
He got a call an hour
before his murder.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.138
Conversation lasted
a minute and a half.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.007
- From a guy named
Amir Dafallah.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.776
Tariq's widow said that
Amir came over here

10:08.809 --> 10:10.010
with Tariq from Sudan.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.912
They were best friends,
but Amir never really

10:11.945 --> 10:13.681
got his act together,
always looking to borrow money.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.682
- Amir have priors?

10:14.715 --> 10:16.750
- Drunk and disorderly
and resisting arrest.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.018
- Hit it.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.333
[lock rattles]

10:33.366 --> 10:35.736
- Yes?
- Amir Dafallah?

10:37.470 --> 10:41.441
CPD.
This is a search warrant.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.844
- What--what is going on?
- Why don't you step aside?

10:43.877 --> 10:44.912
- Excuse me.
- Turn around, please.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.814
- What--
- Arms up.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.019
All right.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.021
Take a seat.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.389
You know a Tariq Bolad?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.091
- What has happened
to Tariq?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.827
- So you know him.
- Yes.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.894
Did something happen to him?

11:00.928 --> 11:04.031
- Yeah, he was injured
last night in a shooting.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.799
- Oh, my God.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.435
- You know anything
about it, Amir?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.103
- No, no. I--

11:10.137 --> 11:11.705
I would never hurt Tariq.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.374
He's my closest friend.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.878
- Well, you got a funny way
of showing it.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.113
It's a .38--

11:20.147 --> 11:22.115
same caliber as the slugs
pulled out of Tariq.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.184
- That--that is not my gun.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.285
- Stay seated.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.188
- Any reason why the
serial numbers are shaved off?

11:28.221 --> 11:29.923
- All right, put your hands
on the counter.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.391
- I swear to you,
that is not my gun.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.160
- Amir, I'm not gonna
ask you again.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.428
Put your hands on the counter.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.431
[dramatic music]

11:38.465 --> 11:43.070
*

11:43.103 --> 11:44.772
[handcuffs clinking, clicking]

11:44.805 --> 11:46.439
- Hey.

11:46.473 --> 11:47.640
- Hey.

11:47.674 --> 11:51.044
- So Tariq's murder might not
have been about the Tuxhorns.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.980
It might have been motivated
by a personal beef.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.047
- You got to be kidding me.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.116
- Yeah, a buddy of his
who came over her from Sudan.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.751
- So Oliver Tuxhorn walks.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.452
- Well, give us some time
to confirm it.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.021
I'll let you know
as soon as we find out.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.256
- Yeah.
Hey, Antonio.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.025
You, uh...

12:05.058 --> 12:07.494
you happy in Intelligence?

12:07.527 --> 12:10.964
I'm making a change
in the investigator's office.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.933
It would be spearheading
major investigations,

12:12.966 --> 12:15.135
not just Chicago--
statewide.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.938
- Are you--you're offering me--
- Yeah.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.539
Commander's pay,
but more--

12:19.572 --> 12:21.942
weekends and holidays off,
regular hours.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.978
See your wife more often.
- I'm divorced.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.048
- Your kids, then.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.018
- [sighs] I'm flattered.
Seriously.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.853
But I'm in the best unit
in Chicago.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.753
- What if told you
Sergeant Voight

12:33.787 --> 12:35.455
already signed off
on you coming over?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.827
Window's gonna close fast.
Let me know.

12:39.860 --> 12:46.867
*

12:49.202 --> 12:50.303
[door closes]

12:50.337 --> 12:51.872
- Ready?

12:51.905 --> 12:54.174
- Huh?
- Ready?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.476
- Yeah.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.487
- What happened
last night, Amir?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.893
- I...

13:12.926 --> 13:15.829
lost my job
as a dishwasher...

13:15.863 --> 13:19.099
- [groans]
- Because they found out I--

13:19.132 --> 13:22.069
I lied about having
a criminal record.

13:22.102 --> 13:26.840
When I got home,
I got a call from INS,

13:26.874 --> 13:30.610
saying that I was at risk
of being deported back to Sudan.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.880
So I called Tariq,

13:32.913 --> 13:37.217
told him that
I was thinking crazy thoughts.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.988
- You were gonna
kill yourself.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.591
- I admit, yes,
I was feeling that way.

13:44.624 --> 13:48.896
Tariq came to meet me
by the water.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.098
He made me feel better,

13:51.131 --> 13:54.834
told me I could stay
with him and Lila.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.038
And then he left, and...

13:58.071 --> 14:01.308
I took the bus
to my apartment.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.375
- Were you gonna kill yourself

14:02.409 --> 14:04.211
with the gun that we found
stashed in your couch?

14:04.244 --> 14:06.579
- No, that is not my gun!
- Then whose is it?

14:06.613 --> 14:07.915
- I-I do not know!

14:07.948 --> 14:11.551
- Do you understand how crazy
that might seem to us?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.887
- I-I do understand,
but it is the truth.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.989
- So you're happy for Tariq,
his success?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.024
- Yes.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.227
- 'Cause, man, he got here,
he landed on his feet.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.896
And you...

14:22.930 --> 14:25.198
Well, you struggled.
Is that a fair assessment?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.000
- Yes, but...

14:27.034 --> 14:30.037
I have never
given up hope...

14:32.005 --> 14:33.673
Until last night.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.278
- You called Tariq.
You gave him that sob story.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.213
He went to see you.

14:40.247 --> 14:41.681
You asked him
for a lot of money.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.218
When he turned you down,
you used that gun to shoot him.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.187
- No!
- Okay, so somebody else

14:47.220 --> 14:50.057
paid you a lot of money
to draw Tariq out!

14:50.090 --> 14:51.959
- Draw him from where?
No!

14:51.992 --> 14:53.160
- You know the gun
is at the crime lab,

14:53.193 --> 14:54.694
being tested for your prints
right now, Amir.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.329
- And they will not find any.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.198
- All right.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.968
You admit to calling him.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.103
You admit to being
in an agitated state last night.

15:03.136 --> 15:06.639
We find the same caliber gun
in your house.

15:06.673 --> 15:07.474
Quit jerking us off!

15:07.507 --> 15:10.710
Tell us the damn truth, man!
Come on!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.212
- [cries]

15:12.245 --> 15:16.383
After what Tariq and I
survived together...

15:18.751 --> 15:20.387
We were like brothers.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.725
I would never hurt him.

15:25.758 --> 15:32.732
*

15:32.765 --> 15:36.369
[crying]

15:36.403 --> 15:40.107
- I don't mind
the body cameras.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.043
- That's an unexpectedly
enlightened attitude for you.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.011
- [scoffs]

15:44.044 --> 15:48.048
[horn honks, tires screech,
woman screams]

15:48.081 --> 15:49.349
- Whoa, did you see that?
- Yeah.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.385
[siren wailing]

16:08.335 --> 16:11.071
- License, proof of insurance,
and registration.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.506
- Here.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.242
- Any reason why you
jumped the curb, sir?

16:15.275 --> 16:18.711
- [sighs] Dropped my cell phone.
I was reaching for it.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.380
I'm sorry.

16:20.413 --> 16:24.084
- Okay, um, you mind
stepping out of the car, sir?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.285
- Why?
- Because we need to

16:25.318 --> 16:28.488
do a field sobriety test.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.124
- Uh, c-could we do it
around the corner?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.759
- Get out of the car, pal.
- Come on.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.368
- Wow.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.275
Business up top,
party down below, huh?

16:51.078 --> 16:52.279
Have you been drinking?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.047
- No.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.250
- What's under
your skirt, there?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.818
- [softly]
A chastity belt.

16:58.851 --> 17:02.289
- I can't hear you.
- It's a chastity belt!

17:02.322 --> 17:04.424
- Burgess, help me out.
- What?

17:04.457 --> 17:07.460
- Chastity belt.
- Seriously?

17:07.493 --> 17:12.165
It's a device to, you know,
secure your privates.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.167
- Good Lord.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.837
You did this voluntarily--
just lock up your genitals?

17:17.869 --> 17:21.508
You weren't forced to do it?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.744
- Voluntarily forced
on me, I guess.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.347
- All right,
we'll leave it at that.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.383
- Well, you have an extraditable
warrant out of Milwaukee

17:30.417 --> 17:31.251
for unpaid tickets,

17:31.284 --> 17:33.186
so we're gonna have to
deal with this

17:33.220 --> 17:35.088
down at the district.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.193
- Ballistics came back.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.462
The gun found at Amir's
is a 100% match.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.531
That gun shot Tariq.
- But...

17:44.564 --> 17:47.267
- But Amir said that he got
on the bus after meeting Tariq.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.868
So we checked the bus pass
that he swiped.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.871
He got on the westbound
Grand Avenue at 10:25 p.m.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.275
- Shot Spotter had shots fired
at 10:34 p.m.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.776
- Mm.
- Amir had already been

17:56.809 --> 17:58.878
on this bus for 9 minute,

17:58.911 --> 18:01.214
and he was 15 blocks away.

18:09.322 --> 18:09.456
.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.022
- Okay, follow me on this.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.594
Tariq's wife says
they were being followed.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.329
Let's assume they were.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.399
Let's assume somebody
in Tuxhorn's camp

18:19.432 --> 18:20.500
found out Tariq's name.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.303
Once they knew that,
they knew everything about him,

18:23.336 --> 18:26.373
including
his best friend, Amir.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.509
First day of the trial,
Amir gets fired from his job,

18:29.542 --> 18:31.311
and he gets
a threatening call from INS.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.214
That sends him in a tailspin.
He calls Tariq for help.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.648
Now, that's either one hell
of a coincidence,

18:35.682 --> 18:38.285
or someone set Amir up.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.686
I called the restaurant
where he worked at.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.554
They said they got
an "anonymous tip"

18:41.588 --> 18:43.290
that Amir had a record.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.259
Then I checked his phone
for that call from INS.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.729
Didn't come from INS.
Came from a pay phone downtown.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.564
I know that's a lot
of dominoes to fall,

18:51.598 --> 18:53.233
but never underestimate
what someone

18:53.266 --> 18:54.434
with 100 million in the bank
can pull off.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.836
- We got some information
on Tuxhorn's older brother, Leo.

18:56.869 --> 18:58.705
Five major priors
for possession.

18:58.738 --> 18:59.639
My guy in Narcotics told me

18:59.672 --> 19:01.641
that he's been
an addict since prep school.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.710
- Yeah, and the data just came
back from Financial Crimes.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.678
Leo just finished
a two-month rehab stint--

19:05.712 --> 19:07.547
[telephone rings]
Serenity Wellness Retreat,

19:07.580 --> 19:08.815
Prescott, Arizona.
- Lindsay.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
- Got out two weeks ago.
- Put a tail on Leo.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.585
- Got it.
- Matter of fact, put a tail

19:12.619 --> 19:14.354
on every member
of Tuxhorn's family.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.756
- Be right there.
Hey, that's Cooke's office.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.692
Oliver Tuxhorn just became
available to talk.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.494
- She leaps
across the conference table...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.863
- I'll tackle her.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.699
Gently.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.601
- I'd like to remind you
and your attorney

19:28.635 --> 19:32.605
of statute 5/5-2
of the criminal code.

19:32.639 --> 19:36.376
Anyone who encourages,
solicits, or helps--

19:36.409 --> 19:37.477
not to mention pays--

19:37.510 --> 19:41.614
someone to commit murder
is as guilty of that murder

19:41.648 --> 19:45.385
by Illinois state law
as the shooter himself.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.753
- Great.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.591
- Do you have any knowledge
of who may have killed

19:51.624 --> 19:53.760
a witness in your trial?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.828
- No.
- Anyone with motive,

19:55.862 --> 19:58.631
say, your family,
ever communicate to you

19:58.665 --> 20:01.334
that they knew
the identity of the witness.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.636
- [exhales deeply]
No.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.373
- Did anyone in prison
ever offer to harm the witness

20:06.406 --> 20:07.640
for you for money?

20:07.674 --> 20:10.743
- No. Mm-mm.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.645
I heard this guy
was African?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.414
- Oliver...

20:15.815 --> 20:17.484
- And how do you know that?

20:17.517 --> 20:18.451
- From my time in prison.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.920
I met a lot of colorful
characters, you know?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.523
Huge gossips, so...

20:23.556 --> 20:25.325
- So what if he was?

20:25.358 --> 20:26.926
- A lot of anti-immigrant
sentiment out there.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.695
Could be a nice lead
for you to pursue.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.731
- Okay, Oliver, we are here
to answer questions,

20:31.764 --> 20:32.832
not pose theories.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.501
- No, I spent two years

20:34.534 --> 20:35.802
in that repulsive jail
for having sex

20:35.835 --> 20:37.304
with a chick
somebody else murdered.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.371
Why are we being polite?

20:38.405 --> 20:41.874
They are here because
my family comes from money

20:41.908 --> 20:44.411
and it pisses them off
to no end, period.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.745
[Lindsay chuckles]

20:45.778 --> 20:48.948
- Oliver, um...
- I'll give you some advice.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.485
Your case against me is dead.
You need to move on.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.455
[dramatic music]

20:55.488 --> 20:56.723
*

20:56.756 --> 20:58.425
- Anything else?

20:58.458 --> 21:01.394
- Oh, I got a couple things
I could add.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.831
*

21:04.864 --> 21:07.534
But I really don't feel
like losing my job

21:07.567 --> 21:08.735
over a little turd like you.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.504
[laughs]

21:11.538 --> 21:14.574
*

21:15.842 --> 21:18.478
- Well, a key was delivered.
Chastity belt unlocked.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.513
And all is well in Whoville.

21:20.547 --> 21:21.848
- Close the door.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.852
[on computer] Business up top,
party down below, huh?

21:25.885 --> 21:26.953
- What are you doing?

21:26.986 --> 21:29.989
- Taking a little keepsake.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.524
[cell phone beeps]

21:31.558 --> 21:33.726
What do you have
under your skirt there?

21:33.760 --> 21:35.728
- [softly]
A chastity belt.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.864
- I can't hear you.
- It's a chastity belt!

21:37.897 --> 21:40.567
- Mike, you should not
be doing this.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.569
- Come on, what are you,
a hall monitor now?

21:42.602 --> 21:43.870
- Chastity belt.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.473
- It's a device to,

21:46.506 --> 21:48.875
you know,
secure your privates.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.977
- Good Lord.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.979
Relax.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.717
[door opens]

21:57.750 --> 21:59.986
- Tariq's security detail?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.021
- No financial irregularities
on any of them.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.491
- Grand jury? ASA's office?
- Same.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.792
No big deposits or purchases.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.960
- The Tuxhorns?

22:07.994 --> 22:09.829
- That's a different deal
entirely.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.664
The Tuxhorn Hotel Group
is a private,

22:11.698 --> 22:13.966
family owned
multimillion-dollar corporation

22:14.000 --> 22:16.503
with no legal public
reporting requirements.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.471
- How long to get
into their books?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.640
- Three or four days.
- Well, you got ten hours.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.875
And it's got to trace back
to Oliver Tuxhorn himself.

22:22.909 --> 22:23.910
- Check this out.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.513
Tuxhorn's lawyers
got payments in to a P.I.--

22:26.546 --> 22:27.346
Jim Radovick.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.449
- I know that name.
- Yeah, ex-cop.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.784
He "retired"
after allegations

22:31.818 --> 22:34.020
of excessive force
and accepting bribes.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.988
- I'll pay him a visit.
- Good.

22:44.597 --> 22:50.903
*

22:50.937 --> 22:53.740
- You trying to push me
out of Intelligence?

22:53.773 --> 22:57.577
ASA Stone told me you signed off
on his job offer.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.678
I can't help but think

22:58.711 --> 23:00.680
it's because you and I
have locked horns once or twice

23:00.713 --> 23:02.982
since I got into this unit.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.552
- Well, this unit
finally came together

23:05.585 --> 23:08.020
when I took you on, Antonio.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.090
And for that,
I'll always be indebted.

23:11.123 --> 23:13.460
And for the record...

23:13.493 --> 23:14.994
I didn't sign off
on you going there.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.796
I recommended you.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.999
- Why?

23:20.032 --> 23:23.570
- You know, I had
one good boss coming up.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.038
He said, "Never hold back
a rising star."

23:28.608 --> 23:30.710
It's your time, Antonio...

23:30.743 --> 23:32.779
to run your own crew.

23:32.812 --> 23:39.819
*

23:45.024 --> 23:46.125
- I don't believe it.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.495
[laughing]
- What's up, Jim?

23:50.530 --> 23:52.532
- So you still on the job,
or you looking for one?

23:52.565 --> 23:55.535
- Well, still on the job.
- [laughs]

23:55.568 --> 23:57.003
- Hey, man.
- Of all the coppers,

23:57.036 --> 23:59.672
I thought, you know,
would've washed out some how,

23:59.706 --> 24:01.774
and here you are
still chugging away.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.810
And me? I'm the one to get
tossed out on his ass.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.011
Come on.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.648
- Sometimes
I surprise myself.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.617
- Not too bad, huh?

24:10.650 --> 24:11.651
I'm not a millionaire,

24:11.684 --> 24:12.752
but at least
I don't have to deal

24:12.785 --> 24:16.656
with bosses, politicians,
and civilian review boards.

24:16.689 --> 24:19.892
- Yeah, there's--
there's always that.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.629
- So what brings you?

24:22.662 --> 24:25.665
- So you work
for Dominick Cooke.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.634
- As much as he'll let me.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.936
- You work with him
on the Oliver Tuxhorn case?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.772
- You seem to know I am.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.106
- Doing what?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.842
- Usual stuff--

24:35.875 --> 24:38.044
background checks, poking holes
in the state's case.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.680
- You looking into
the eyewitness against Tuxhorn?

24:44.851 --> 24:46.919
- Why are you here, Al?

24:48.821 --> 24:52.058
- Well, that witness
was killed yesterday.

24:52.091 --> 24:58.064
*

24:58.097 --> 25:00.066
- Oh, okay.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.168
*

25:02.201 --> 25:04.971
- You know anything
about that?

25:06.205 --> 25:10.076
- Look, um...

25:10.109 --> 25:13.112
this family, the Tuxhorns...
[scoffs]

25:13.145 --> 25:17.216
They got what I call
a-a plantation mentality.

25:17.249 --> 25:20.887
Everybody is a servant.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.089
Me? As long as
the checks clear,

25:23.122 --> 25:26.626
I can deal with any kind
of huge personalities, but...

25:26.659 --> 25:29.095
*

25:29.128 --> 25:31.731
They wanted to know
who that witness was.

25:31.764 --> 25:32.832
- Who's they?

25:32.865 --> 25:36.636
*

25:36.669 --> 25:39.839
- The dad and the brother,
uh, Leo.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.742
- The junkie?
- Yeah.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.611
He's on the outs
with the family--

25:44.644 --> 25:45.712
black sheep-type deal.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.114
I got the sense that, uh,

25:48.147 --> 25:50.917
he wanted to swoop in
and act a hero, you know?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.251
- Yeah.
- He even asked me in private

25:52.284 --> 25:53.786
if I could get next
to the witness,

25:53.820 --> 25:55.722
and I said that's
the first and last time

25:55.755 --> 25:58.090
you get to ask me
that question.

25:58.124 --> 25:59.859
He waved me off
like I was a homeless bum,

25:59.892 --> 26:02.028
but he was dead serious.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.162
- Him?

26:03.195 --> 26:05.732
*

26:05.765 --> 26:07.033
- Yeah, that's him.

26:07.066 --> 26:14.073
*

26:18.110 --> 26:20.747
- Well, clearly rehab
did not work for Leo.

26:20.780 --> 26:23.049
- Right?
Look at this guy.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.083
He is jonesing.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.118
All right.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.692
All right, here we go.
Guy's coming in.

26:32.725 --> 26:33.893
You see him?
- I see him.

26:33.926 --> 26:38.665
- Come on, baby.
Make that exchange.

26:38.698 --> 26:39.732
All right,
that's the exchange.

26:39.766 --> 26:40.767
- Right now?
- Hit it.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.034
[siren wails]
Let's go grab him.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.870
[engine turning over]

26:43.903 --> 26:47.039
[sirens wailing]

26:47.073 --> 26:49.776
[tires screeching]

26:49.809 --> 26:52.945
- Get out of the way!
[horns honking]

26:52.979 --> 26:54.914
- Stop! Police!

26:54.947 --> 26:57.917
[suspenseful music]

26:57.950 --> 27:04.991
*

27:06.926 --> 27:08.127
- Mm!

27:08.160 --> 27:09.328
- Hey! Spit it out!
Spit it out!

27:09.361 --> 27:10.930
- Mm!
- Spit it out, Leo!

27:10.963 --> 27:13.199
- Spit it out!
- Don't bite me!

27:13.232 --> 27:14.801
- Here.
- I don't want to touch it.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.803
- [groaning]
- Shut up.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.738
- Oh, I'd say you got
a real problem here, Leo.

27:18.771 --> 27:19.939
- [groaning]
- Such an addict,

27:19.972 --> 27:23.309
you don't toss the drugs when
a couple cops are chasing you?

27:23.342 --> 27:24.844
[handcuffs clicking]
- [groans]

27:24.877 --> 27:27.847
[energetic dance music playing]

27:27.880 --> 27:31.317
*

27:31.350 --> 27:33.152
- All right,
everybody take a walk.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.286
- Oh.
- Really?

27:34.320 --> 27:37.056
- Oh, jeez.
- Now.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.157
Come on.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.727
- Not cool.
- Wow. Great.

27:44.230 --> 27:48.768
- Do you know we just popped
your brother for possession?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.236
I don't know how much
experience you have

27:50.269 --> 27:52.872
with junkies that are looking
at jail time,

27:52.905 --> 27:55.074
but they tend to get very...

27:55.107 --> 27:56.142
chatty.

27:56.175 --> 27:59.979
- Why do you keep finding
excuses to talk to me?

28:00.012 --> 28:03.115
*

28:03.149 --> 28:07.119
- I can't let you go out
and live it up...

28:07.153 --> 28:11.190
while there's a woman alone,
pregnant,

28:11.223 --> 28:15.327
whose husband is gone
because of you.

28:15.361 --> 28:19.766
- So you're just gonna
keep following me around?

28:19.799 --> 28:21.868
What about if, um--

28:21.901 --> 28:26.005
if I go somewhere private,
someplace nobody knows?

28:26.038 --> 28:28.140
You follow me there?

28:28.174 --> 28:31.878
*

28:31.911 --> 28:33.946
- [chuckles]

28:38.350 --> 28:42.254
Do you know what
I like about Midori?

28:42.288 --> 28:45.424
- Let me guess.
It reminds you of high school.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.027
I get that a lot from girls.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.129
- [chuckles]
No.

28:53.199 --> 28:55.067
It stains.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.807
- Hey.
Lick it up.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.241
I know you want to.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.211
- [laughs]

29:05.244 --> 29:07.113
Ladies, he usually puts
the date-rape drugs

29:07.146 --> 29:08.080
in the champagne,

29:08.114 --> 29:11.183
but I'd toss all your drinks
just in case.

29:19.425 --> 29:19.558
.

29:19.591 --> 29:19.892
[door opens]

29:21.427 --> 29:23.930
- Hey.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.432
[keys jingling]

29:26.465 --> 29:28.801
[sighs]

29:30.837 --> 29:33.806
How was rehab in Arizona?

29:33.840 --> 29:37.877
- I feel a punch line coming.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.278
- Nope.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.348
I'm serious.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.984
You glad you went?

29:45.017 --> 29:47.553
- I am, actually.

29:47.586 --> 29:51.390
It's still a struggle
for me, obviously, but...

29:51.423 --> 29:52.424
I'll keep trying.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.560
- Well, I know at least
one thing they teach there

29:54.593 --> 29:57.964
is that hiding from
the problems in your life

29:57.997 --> 30:00.399
is not an effective way
of dealing with them.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.101
In fact, not only
do those problems

30:02.134 --> 30:03.836
never get tackled...

30:03.870 --> 30:06.538
they fester.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.108
And they create even bigger
problems in your life.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.410
Is that right?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.512
- You want the name
of my dealer, right?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.414
Right?

30:15.447 --> 30:16.983
- Wrong.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.985
I want to know how you got
to the witness

30:19.018 --> 30:20.352
in your brother's trial.

30:20.386 --> 30:24.390
[dramatic music]

30:24.423 --> 30:26.425
I didn't get to him.
- Did you try?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.494
*

30:28.527 --> 30:30.396
- For a minute.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.865
But then I realized the insanity
of it all, and I let it go.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.400
- But your brother put you
up to it, right?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.903
- He made his desires known,

30:36.936 --> 30:40.406
but h-he didn't put anybody
up to anything.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.108
- How did the witness
get killed, Leo?

30:42.141 --> 30:44.643
- I have no idea.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.013
- All we have to do
is lift the prints off the gun

30:47.046 --> 30:48.447
and the fingerprints off
the apartment

30:48.480 --> 30:49.448
where the gun was stashed at.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.317
- You asked me to be honest.
I'm being honest.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.985
I don't know anything
about a gun

30:53.019 --> 30:55.521
or--or an apartment
or anything.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.156
- Where were you last night?

30:57.189 --> 31:01.660
- I was at my friend's
apartment off Rush.

31:01.693 --> 31:06.365
The were four people there
that can attest to that.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.566
- You're
a three-time loser, Leo.

31:07.599 --> 31:08.534
- [sighs]

31:08.567 --> 31:10.336
- You're facing some
real jail time right now,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.671
and this is your one chance
to help yourself out.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.908
- I didn't do anything
to that witness.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.177
Okay, I'm a lot of things.
I've made a lot of mistakes.

31:18.210 --> 31:22.348
I-I've disappointed
a lot of people.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.583
But I'm not a killer.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.186
*

31:27.219 --> 31:29.588
[door opens]

31:29.621 --> 31:32.091
*

31:32.124 --> 31:33.225
- Stone called.

31:33.259 --> 31:36.495
Uh, Tuxhorn's lawyer is pushing
for a motion to dismiss.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.430
Stone needs to know
if we got a leg to stand on.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.399
- How long until he needs
to decide?

31:40.432 --> 31:43.002
- 24 hours.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.104
- All right,
check out Leo's alibi.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.372
- Copy.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.656
- Did you post that
on Facebook?

32:07.226 --> 32:08.660
- Yeah.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.499
Couple of buddies of mine--

32:13.532 --> 32:15.567
we just share
crazy stuff we see.

32:15.601 --> 32:20.006
- So you illegally accessed
a CPD administrative server

32:20.039 --> 32:23.609
to capture video
from your city-issued body cam

32:23.642 --> 32:25.111
for one purpose--

32:25.144 --> 32:28.014
to humiliate
a citizen of this city,

32:28.047 --> 32:31.650
the same city we took
an oath to protect

32:31.683 --> 32:34.520
from bullies like you.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.488
- Other cops do it, too,
Sergeant.

32:36.522 --> 32:39.058
I mean, more than
you probably realize.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.659
- So you knew about this.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.995
- [stammering]
I--

32:43.029 --> 32:49.468
*

32:49.501 --> 32:52.571
I didn't know that he was gonna
post it on social media.

32:52.604 --> 32:55.574
- Oh.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.576
Starting tomorrow,
you're both walking

32:57.609 --> 33:01.013
CHA vertical foot patrol
in the Lathrop Homes.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.549
And, Sorensen, in your case,

33:03.582 --> 33:05.517
that's only because
I don't have the authority

33:05.551 --> 33:08.187
to suspend you myself,
you stupid son of a bitch.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.623
But believe me,
I'm working on it.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.625
Get out of my sight...

33:13.659 --> 33:15.527
both of you...

33:15.561 --> 33:17.029
now.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.598
*

33:19.631 --> 33:22.068
- Did you rat me out?
- No.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.737
But now I wish
I would have.

33:25.771 --> 33:30.309
*

33:30.342 --> 33:32.178
- Hey, boss.

33:32.211 --> 33:35.147
We got something here.
- Okay.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.582
- All right.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.250
Take it away there, Chris.
- Okay.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.552
So each and every
Tuxhorn property

33:40.586 --> 33:42.088
has its own profit and loss
statement

33:42.121 --> 33:43.322
and its own manager.
- Mm.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.224
- With access to all associated
accounts, right?

33:45.257 --> 33:47.093
- Mm-hmm. Money goes in,
money comes out regular,

33:47.126 --> 33:50.096
except this one property
in Dubai.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.730
Place isn't even open yet,
but it's showing profits

33:51.763 --> 33:54.600
of $100,000 a year,
going back four years.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.702
- Yeah, so it's clearly
a shell.

33:56.735 --> 33:58.637
They've been dumping money.
- But a week ago,

33:58.670 --> 34:01.840
there's one large cash
withdrawal--$300,000.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.610
And only one person could have
pulled it out--the manager.

34:04.643 --> 34:06.578
- Who's that?

34:06.612 --> 34:09.581
- Sloane Tuxhorn,
Oliver's sister.

34:09.614 --> 34:10.716
- Well, that still
doesn't help us,

34:10.748 --> 34:12.818
not if we can't link her
and the money back to Oliver.

34:12.851 --> 34:15.286
- She's not on the visitor
or call logs to the jail.

34:15.321 --> 34:16.522
She never emailed him.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.723
There's no proof
they communicated.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.358
- Ah, well, maybe there is.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.627
That number, 300,000,
that rang a bell, right?

34:21.659 --> 34:24.130
So I went back through Oliver's
Facebook posts that he made

34:24.163 --> 34:25.364
while he was still in prison.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.766
He commented on post
that his sister Sloane made

34:27.799 --> 34:31.337
about his getting release,
and I quote,

34:31.370 --> 34:34.239
"Wouldn't 300,000 likes
be Rad...

34:34.273 --> 34:37.176
if that happened?"

34:37.208 --> 34:41.246
- 300,000, Rad--
Jim Radovick.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.181
- Okay, when was this?

34:43.215 --> 34:46.351
- Two days before the murder

34:46.385 --> 34:47.753
- It's not enough
to charge her.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.288
- It's enough
to bluff her, though.

34:49.321 --> 34:50.856
We got eyes on her?
- We do.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.257
Get her ass in here.

35:02.434 --> 35:02.568
.

35:02.601 --> 35:02.901
[door opens]

35:05.471 --> 35:08.507
- Huh. It's Jim Radovick's
statement.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.310
- Hmm.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.280
- Yeah, he's in
the interview room next door.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.416
Hmm.

35:17.449 --> 35:21.253
Says the whole thing
was your idea.

35:21.287 --> 35:25.424
You wanted the witness killed,
arranged payment,

35:25.457 --> 35:27.659
You're the mastermind,
basically.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.261
- Well, he's lying.

35:29.295 --> 35:32.798
- Everybody lies, Sloane,
one way or another.

35:32.831 --> 35:36.368
What matters is credibility...

35:36.402 --> 35:39.271
in front of a judge,
in front of a jury,

35:39.305 --> 35:40.639
in front of us.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.712
- Right now you're looking
at obstruction of justice.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.215
It's a class 4 felony.

35:49.248 --> 35:51.683
You'll do a year, maybe two.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.785
That's if you cooperate

35:53.819 --> 35:56.788
and give a full statement.

35:56.822 --> 36:01.193
We go with Radovick's version,
you're looking at bribery,

36:01.227 --> 36:02.728
witness tampering,

36:02.761 --> 36:05.564
and soliciting a murderer.

36:05.597 --> 36:08.400
That's a class 2 felony.

36:08.434 --> 36:10.569
You will do ten years.

36:10.602 --> 36:17.609
*

36:18.610 --> 36:19.745
- Radovick's an ex-cop.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.447
I'm happy to go
with his version.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.383
- I just got him the money.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.253
That's it.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.421
Radovick said it would take
a boatload of money

36:29.455 --> 36:30.456
to get him to do it.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.291
- Uh-huh.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.596
- So I offered 300,000,
and he said we were in business.

36:37.629 --> 36:41.333
*

36:41.367 --> 36:45.371
- How did he get the identity
of the witness?

36:45.404 --> 36:48.507
- I don't know,
but he did.

36:51.577 --> 36:54.246
And the money was only to get
the witness to change his story,

36:54.280 --> 36:56.482
not kill him.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.517
But something went wrong.

37:00.886 --> 37:04.323
- And Oliver told you
to do this...

37:04.356 --> 37:06.525
the Facebook post
from in jail.

37:06.558 --> 37:11.630
*

37:11.663 --> 37:13.832
- Yes.

37:13.865 --> 37:20.439
*

37:20.472 --> 37:22.441
- Hey, Al.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.643
- Jim.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.613
- So what's the latest?
You get the brother?

37:27.646 --> 37:29.781
- You know,
driving over here,

37:29.815 --> 37:32.784
I remembered
one of the things that, um...

37:32.818 --> 37:35.287
that got you fired
from the job...

37:37.323 --> 37:39.791
Making false arrests.

37:45.564 --> 37:49.768
- You're seriously gonna take
Leo's word over mine?

37:49.801 --> 37:52.604
- Not his.
His sister's.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.707
*

37:55.741 --> 37:58.710
She laid it all out.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.715
Put your hands up, Jim.

38:03.749 --> 38:05.917
Put your hands up.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.687
- I got kids, Al.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.823
- Put your hands up, man.
Come on.

38:11.857 --> 38:16.928
*

38:16.962 --> 38:19.431
- You listen to me, okay?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.436
I went--

38:24.470 --> 38:27.773
I went to talk to Tariq,
offer him some money.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.708
Okay?

38:29.741 --> 38:31.677
He reached into his pocket.
I thought it was a gun.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.579
So I drew.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.847
I saw it was a phone
when he went down.

38:35.881 --> 38:38.517
Okay, but him getting shot...

38:38.550 --> 38:41.387
that's not premeditated.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.988
Okay, Al?
That's important.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.724
You got to put that
in your report, right?

38:45.757 --> 38:46.892
It's not premeditated.

38:46.925 --> 38:49.495
- What about the part where you
break into a man's home,

38:49.528 --> 38:53.865
plant a weapon,
and get paid 300 grand?

38:53.899 --> 38:55.634
Was that premeditated?

38:55.667 --> 39:02.741
*

39:07.913 --> 39:10.616
- Where's that little smile
today, Oliver?

39:15.554 --> 39:16.888
You know,
of all the people you hurt,

39:16.922 --> 39:20.626
you can add one more
to the list--your sister.

39:20.659 --> 39:23.629
State's Attorney's
gonna push for three years.

39:23.662 --> 39:30.669
*

39:47.819 --> 39:49.621
- You're pissed.
You're miserable.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.889
You want a new partner.

39:50.922 --> 39:53.058
I get it, but, Burgess,
it is not that easy.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.993
You're just gonna have
to suck it up.

39:55.026 --> 39:56.995
- I didn't say anything.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.568
- You're right. You didn't.
- Yeah.

40:02.601 --> 40:03.969
- [sighs]

40:04.002 --> 40:07.473
I'm doing all I can.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.474
- I know.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.877
[door opens]

40:11.910 --> 40:14.946
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.783
- Nothing.
I'll catch you later.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.952
*

40:20.986 --> 40:22.788
- [sighs]

40:22.821 --> 40:27.058
- All I ever wanted to be
was a Chicago cop.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.461
- Well, it sounds like
you still would be--

40:29.495 --> 40:30.762
still bringing down
the bad guys,

40:30.796 --> 40:34.600
still serving your city,
just changing locations.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.869
- [sighs]

40:37.903 --> 40:40.672
This guy Stone--

40:40.706 --> 40:42.107
I like him.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.643
He's a straight shooter,

40:44.676 --> 40:48.480
doesn't play politics,
fights for the right things.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.748
I could go to battle with him.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.551
- How often can you say that
about somebody?

40:52.584 --> 40:54.520
- Yeah.

40:54.553 --> 40:57.122
- You also got to think of this
as a life question,

40:57.155 --> 41:00.792
not just a job question,
you know?

41:00.826 --> 41:02.528
I mean, when I went
over to Ambo,

41:02.561 --> 41:05.964
it really helped me out
in terms of home life,

41:05.997 --> 41:07.733
big-time.

41:07.766 --> 41:10.068
Would the hours be normal?

41:10.101 --> 41:11.570
- Normal-ish,

41:11.603 --> 41:15.006
not like Intelligence hours.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.577
- 'Cause Diego's race
that you missed...

41:18.610 --> 41:20.045
he won.

41:22.614 --> 41:23.915
- [sighs]

41:23.949 --> 41:26.918
[indistinct chatter]

41:26.952 --> 41:29.921
[bluesy music playing]

41:29.955 --> 41:31.657
*

41:31.690 --> 41:34.793
Hey.
- Hey.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.962
Thanks for your help.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.797
- It's a team effort.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.867
- Tariq never should have
slipped through

41:41.900 --> 41:43.635
protective custody.

41:43.669 --> 41:46.872
That one's gonna haunt me.

41:46.905 --> 41:49.775
- Looks like you need
a new lead investigator.

41:49.808 --> 41:53.111
- [chuckles]
You know of a good one?

41:53.144 --> 41:55.647
- Me.

41:55.681 --> 41:59.951
*

41:59.985 --> 42:02.921
- I was hoping
for some good news.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.023
Welcome aboard, Antonio.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.826
- Looking forward to
working with you.
