again, how positive‐‐
how positive you are.

1:12:10.059 --> 1:12:11.928
‐ So something
that I grew up with

1:12:11.994 --> 1:12:13.930
that was huge in my family
was, like, scrapbooking

1:12:13.996 --> 1:12:15.765
and family albums
and things like that.

1:12:15.832 --> 1:12:18.201
And I brought a lot of things
here to remind me of them...

1:12:18.267 --> 1:12:19.902
‐ Yeah.
‐ When I'm feeling homesick.

1:12:19.969 --> 1:12:22.205
And I thought
it would be so fun that‐‐

1:12:22.271 --> 1:12:23.773
if we could start our own.

1:12:23.840 --> 1:12:24.941
What do you think about that?
‐ I love that.

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:26.409
‐ You like that?
‐ Yes. Absolutely.

1:12:26.475 --> 1:12:29.378

1:12:29.445 --> 1:12:31.714
You know, she didn't get
to go on a date this week,

1:12:31.781 --> 1:12:34.317
<i>but she is so positive</i>

1:12:34.383 --> 1:12:35.918
and just happy
to have this moment

1:12:35.985 --> 1:12:37.220
that we're having
right now.

1:12:37.286 --> 1:12:40.756
I think this is
a awesome idea, and I love it.

1:12:40.823 --> 1:12:42.258
And I love the picture.
‐ You like it?

1:12:42.325 --> 1:12:44.961
‐ And I'm proud
of my three hearts.

1:12:45.027 --> 1:12:45.962
‐ I know you did.
‐ I think this is

1:12:46.028 --> 1:12:47.763
the perfect first memory.

1:12:47.830 --> 1:12:49.165

<i>and tonight, again,</i>
<i>shows me that</i>

1:12:56.305 --> 1:12:58.641
there's a reason why
I feel very special about her.

1:12:58.708 --> 1:13:01.611
‐ Just because I'm not
the loudest in the room‐‐

1:13:01.677 --> 1:13:03.579
and it's not because
I'm not interested.

1:13:03.646 --> 1:13:06.282
It's just because
it's hard for me.

1:13:06.349 --> 1:13:08.618
‐ It's‐‐but you got to be
a pretty confident woman.

1:13:08.684 --> 1:13:09.652
You have to be.
‐ Yeah.

1:13:09.719 --> 1:13:11.187

It's a testament to how great
these women really are.

1:13:16.592 --> 1:13:20.096
‐ I know exactly what I'm
looking for in a relationship,

1:13:20.162 --> 1:13:23.833
and it's obvious that I care
very deeply about being here.

1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:25.368
And, like, I felt a spark.

1:13:25.434 --> 1:13:27.236
<i>‐ Everyone brings something</i>
<i>a little different.</i>

1:13:27.303 --> 1:13:29.205
It really is a good problem
to have,

1:13:29.272 --> 1:13:31.641
and ultimately, the person
that I walk out of here with

1:13:31.707 --> 1:13:34.243
at the end of it all
is going to be perfect for me.

1:13:34.310 --> 1:13:36.712
‐ And all this talk
is reminding me

1:13:36.779 --> 1:13:38.748
of pillow talk.
‐ You brought it back?

1:13:38.814 --> 1:13:41.150
‐ You have a different pillow.
‐ First off, this is way bigger

1:13:41.217 --> 1:13:43.819
and a‐‐terrible.
Please burn that.

1:13:43.886 --> 1:13:46.522
‐ I was gonna kiss it
and then try and kiss you,

1:13:46.589 --> 1:13:48.658
but he's, like, kind of scary.

1:13:48.724 --> 1:13:50.159
‐ You were kissing that.
You haven't kissed me.

1:13:50.226 --> 1:13:51.527
‐ No‐‐yeah, I know.

1:13:51.594 --> 1:13:52.862

And now we're back
to square one.

1:14:30.266 --> 1:14:34.603
It's weird vibes, and
Elizabeth's being Elizabeth.

1:14:34.670 --> 1:14:36.739
<i>Hasn't even looked at me.</i>
<i>Hasn't talked to me.</i>

1:14:36.806 --> 1:14:40.743
So y‐‐you're sorry

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:43.346
and then, you‐‐your forgot
because you have ADHD.

1:14:43.412 --> 1:14:45.815
The other girls don't know
the real story,

1:14:45.881 --> 1:14:48.551
and they're still looking at me
like, "Poor Elizabeth."

1:14:48.617 --> 1:14:50.686
Poor [bleep] Shanae.
Like, poor everyone else.

1:14:50.753 --> 1:14:53.823
'Cause she's lying to everyone
and making me look bad.

1:14:53.889 --> 1:14:55.057
Yesterday...
‐ Yes.

1:14:55.124 --> 1:14:56.592
‐ We had a conversation,
and you had‐‐

1:14:56.659 --> 1:14:58.027
you said you had AD‐‐
‐ Yeah, I tried to come to you

1:14:58.094 --> 1:14:59.428
'cause it sounded like
you were upset,

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:01.163
so I wanted to speak with you.
‐ Right, but I thought

1:15:01.230 --> 1:15:03.132
you and I were on
the same page yesterday, like‐‐

1:15:03.199 --> 1:15:05.267
‐ We were not on the same page
yesterday.

1:15:05.334 --> 1:15:07.636
‐ So is it your ADHD,

1:15:07.703 --> 1:15:10.072
or is it me
that you have a problem with?

1:15:10.139 --> 1:15:12.508
‐ I think this is really
inappropriate, Shanae.

1:15:12.575 --> 1:15:14.176
‐ So are you telling everyone
in the house you have ADHD?

1:15:14.243 --> 1:15:16.145
‐ You already brought it
to the attention of the girls.

1:15:16.212 --> 1:15:17.580
‐ I didn't tell anyone
you had ADHD.

1:15:17.646 --> 1:15:19.515
I have AD‐‐ADHD.
‐ You absolutely did tell‐‐

1:15:19.582 --> 1:15:23.052
‐ Everyone‐‐I mean,
[bleep] little kids have ADHD.

1:15:23.119 --> 1:15:24.387
‐ Okay.
‐ And I think

1:15:24.453 --> 1:15:26.722
you're using that as an excuse.

1:15:26.789 --> 1:15:28.924
‐ I really don't appreciate
how you're coming at me.

1:15:28.991 --> 1:15:30.926
And if you'd like
to apologize to me, I'll do so,

1:15:30.993 --> 1:15:32.094
but unfortunately,
I'm not gonna engage

1:15:32.161 --> 1:15:33.729
in this conversation
with you anymore.

1:15:33.796 --> 1:15:37.400
‐ Okay. Well, I'm just saying,
like, I have ADHD too, so...

1:15:37.466 --> 1:15:38.934
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>if anyone has heard,</i>

1:15:39.001 --> 1:15:42.238
but she has ADHD,
and it's really bad.

1:15:42.304 --> 1:15:43.973
‐ Well, I was just confronted
by Shanae,

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:46.809
and she was incredibly
aggressive and rude to me

1:15:46.876 --> 1:15:48.044
out in front of the house.

1:15:48.110 --> 1:15:50.413
‐ I don't want
to ever upset her again

1:15:50.479 --> 1:15:52.281
because I feel terrible.

1:15:52.348 --> 1:15:53.482
She has ADHD.

1:15:53.549 --> 1:15:56.752
<i>[tense music]</i>

1:15:56.819 --> 1:15:59.722
[laughs]

1:15:59.789 --> 1:16:01.624
What's up?

1:16:01.690 --> 1:16:03.859
‐ So Elizabeth was telling us
a little bit

1:16:03.926 --> 1:16:06.695
about how your conversation
with her went,

1:16:06.762 --> 1:16:10.900
and it didn't sound like
it was very productive.

1:16:10.966 --> 1:16:11.967
‐ I didn't get
why you were mad‐‐

1:16:12.034 --> 1:16:14.570
‐ So Clayton sat down
and asked,

1:16:14.637 --> 1:16:15.738
so I told him,

1:16:15.805 --> 1:16:18.874
"Elizabeth has given me
red flags.

1:16:18.941 --> 1:16:21.677
"One day, she's this person.
The next day, she's not."

1:16:21.744 --> 1:16:23.212
It sounds petty, I know,
but again,

1:16:23.279 --> 1:16:26.215
you know when people are
liking you or not liking you.

1:16:26.282 --> 1:16:28.350
Then I was outside, and I
overheard Elizabeth crying

1:16:28.417 --> 1:16:29.919
and saying she had ADHD.

1:16:29.985 --> 1:16:31.187
‐ You knew that I had ADHD

1:16:31.253 --> 1:16:32.521
because you told everyone
on the group date.

1:16:32.588 --> 1:16:33.889
‐ Because I was‐‐
I'm trying to tell you‐‐

1:16:33.956 --> 1:16:35.858
‐ It's her business to bring up
or not bring up.

1:16:35.925 --> 1:16:36.992
What does that have to do
with you?

1:16:37.059 --> 1:16:37.993
‐ It's nobody else's business
but hers

1:16:38.060 --> 1:16:39.261
to bring it up.
‐ Yeah.

1:16:39.328 --> 1:16:40.296
‐ What is the problem?
‐ It's her prob‐‐

1:16:40.362 --> 1:16:41.330
It's her situation.

1:16:41.397 --> 1:16:42.331
‐ Okay, I did screw up,

1:16:42.398 --> 1:16:43.566
but also, she knew‐‐

1:16:43.632 --> 1:16:44.900
‐ No. There's no "and, but..."
‐ There's no

1:16:44.967 --> 1:16:46.268
"I screwed up, but..."
‐ Yeah, like...

1:16:46.335 --> 1:16:48.070
‐ Maybe just apologize,
you know?

1:16:48.137 --> 1:16:51.740
‐ You did share
some information with the group

1:16:51.807 --> 1:16:53.843
that wasn't yours to share

1:16:53.909 --> 1:16:57.146
and that felt really violating
to me,

1:16:57.213 --> 1:17:00.316
so I would really appreciate
an apology for that.

1:17:00.382 --> 1:17:02.518
‐ I'm sorry that I hurt you,
but you knew how I felt.

1:17:02.585 --> 1:17:03.652
‐ But there's‐‐
no, but there's‐‐

1:17:03.719 --> 1:17:04.920
But that's not an "I'm sorry."

1:17:04.987 --> 1:17:06.489
‐ We can keep going, right?

1:17:06.555 --> 1:17:07.656
‐ [sighs]
‐ You guys wanna keep going?

1:17:07.723 --> 1:17:09.125
‐ No, but‐‐
‐ That's what I'm saying.

1:17:09.191 --> 1:17:11.660
<i>‐ As much as Shanae has been</i>

1:17:16.799 --> 1:17:17.800
‐ Yeah, I think,
