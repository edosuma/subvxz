WEBVTT

00:06.031 --> 00:08.299
BOY:
Come on, boy! Let's go!

00:08.333 --> 00:11.202
WOMAN: All of this property ends
about right there.

00:11.236 --> 00:12.603
WOMAN 2:
Yeah.

00:12.638 --> 00:14.405
Good job! Let's go
throw the ball.

00:14.439 --> 00:17.175
This would be such a great place
to raise a family.

00:17.209 --> 00:18.910
Oh, and the school
district is fantastic.

00:18.944 --> 00:21.779
I wish I could go
to first grade again. (laughs)

00:21.814 --> 00:24.015
I don't know, Peter.
It looks like a swamp.

00:24.049 --> 00:25.364
That's what those
lots looked like, too.

00:25.389 --> 00:27.318
And now, voila!

00:27.319 --> 00:29.554
And it's only a half an hour
from work.

00:29.588 --> 00:31.155
Come on, boy, get it!

00:31.190 --> 00:32.323
I don't want
to twist your arm,

00:32.357 --> 00:34.058
but these lots
are going fast.

00:34.092 --> 00:36.360
We were hoping to find something
to move into soon.

00:36.395 --> 00:37.915
That's the beauty
of Homegrove Estates.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.665
The contractor assures me
they can have your house

00:40.699 --> 00:42.967
up and running
within the year.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.903
Hey, boy.
We can get a dog.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.471
You always wanted
a puppy.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.674
Come here, boy.
A year? Really?

00:49.708 --> 00:50.908
Come here.

00:50.943 --> 00:52.944
And we can
customize everything?

00:52.978 --> 00:54.612
Everything.

00:54.646 --> 00:57.315
This could be our own slice
of heaven, Care-Bear.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.317
No smog,

00:59.351 --> 01:00.518
no crime...

01:05.324 --> 01:06.691
Oh!
Oh, my God!

01:06.725 --> 01:09.093
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here!

01:09.127 --> 01:12.296
Wait! No!
I have other available lots!

01:17.402 --> 01:19.704
Okay, we have to get up.

01:19.738 --> 01:21.706
I don't want
to have to fire you

01:21.740 --> 01:22.974
for being late.

01:23.008 --> 01:25.877
I'll appeal
and tell them why.

01:25.911 --> 01:29.280
SAROYAN:
Mm-mm, up, up...

01:29.314 --> 01:30.882
(groans)

01:33.318 --> 01:37.054
(groans)
Not sure I told you...

01:37.089 --> 01:39.223
my parents are coming
to town.

01:39.258 --> 01:41.392
No, you didn't.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.862
That's good.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.498
I mean, you haven't
seen them in a while.

01:46.505 --> 01:47.965
Yeah.

01:47.966 --> 01:50.668
They want to meet you.

01:50.702 --> 01:53.704
Okay, uh, the way you said that
sounds horrifying.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.106
No, no, no.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.642
It'll be fun.
They're gonna love you.

01:57.676 --> 01:58.776
We've been dating long enough

01:58.810 --> 02:00.144
for me to know
when you're lying.

02:00.178 --> 02:02.647
It's just, they're
a little... traditional,

02:02.681 --> 02:05.449
old school, and they still think
of me as their crazy son.

02:05.484 --> 02:06.784
Okay, this is getting worse
and worse.

02:06.818 --> 02:09.287
No, no, no.
Yes. You're saying that, to them,

02:09.321 --> 02:10.588
I'm gonna be
another one of your mistakes?

02:10.622 --> 02:12.256
Why exactly?

02:12.291 --> 02:15.393
Because I'm your non-Iranian,
non-Muslim, black girlfriend?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.728
This came out all wrong.
(text alert sounds)

02:17.763 --> 02:19.864
No, I think it came out
exactly right.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.768
I got a body
in a swamp.

02:23.802 --> 02:26.170
We can talk about this later.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.010
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:35.414 --> 02:37.181
(siren wails briefly)

02:37.215 --> 02:40.418
Based on the vertical nature
of the frontal bone as well

02:40.452 --> 02:42.219
as the mental eminence
of the mandible,

02:42.254 --> 02:44.889
the victim appears to be female,
in her mid-30s.

02:44.923 --> 02:48.159
The prominent nature of the
maxilla suggests Caucasian.

02:48.193 --> 02:49.894
The organs
show no sign

02:49.928 --> 02:52.096
of decomposition despite
the amount of predation

02:52.130 --> 02:53.631
on the rest
of the body.

02:53.665 --> 02:54.999
HODGINS: Someone's getting marked
tardy today.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.034
I called you, and you never
picked up your phone.

02:57.069 --> 02:58.703
Hey, look, there's nothing
I could do, okay?

02:58.737 --> 03:00.705
The assistant director--
he just kept me at the office.

03:00.739 --> 03:02.073
Is everything okay?

03:02.107 --> 03:03.207
Yeah, yeah, just, you know,

03:03.241 --> 03:04.575
reviewing some case files,
that's all.

03:04.609 --> 03:06.777
Case file? Your case files?
Did you make a mistake?

03:06.812 --> 03:07.878
No, not my mistakes, okay?

03:07.913 --> 03:09.847
I was just reviewing
some other reports

03:09.881 --> 03:11.716
for some other agents,
that's all.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.384
Wow, sounds like you're
teacher's pet.

03:13.418 --> 03:15.152
Ha-ha! Okay, enough with
the school references, okay?

03:15.187 --> 03:16.988
What's up with swamp thing?
Not sure.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.422
Animals have eaten
the hands and feet.

03:18.457 --> 03:20.491
Normally, they'd eat
the meaty parts first.

03:20.525 --> 03:22.960
I have a question.
So why is it that, um,

03:22.995 --> 03:24.528
the animals didn't eat
the meaty parts?

03:24.563 --> 03:26.864
BRENNAN: We have no explanation.
It's very frustrating.

03:26.898 --> 03:30.501
Okay. Well, there any clothes
or personal effects?

03:30.535 --> 03:32.737
No. It appears
to be a body dump.

03:32.771 --> 03:33.771
In addition to predation,

03:33.805 --> 03:35.072
there's extensive fracturing
on the bone.

03:35.107 --> 03:36.273
Beaten to death?

03:36.308 --> 03:37.875
I don't have an explanation
for the fracturing

03:37.909 --> 03:40.111
at this point, but it doesn't
appear to be blunt force.

03:40.145 --> 03:42.046
So, do we at least have
time of death?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.115
HODGINS: Well, that's where it starts
to really get weird.

03:44.149 --> 03:45.716
Insect activity is
all over the place.

03:45.751 --> 03:48.619
We've got colonization
and development of <i>Piophilidae</i>

03:48.653 --> 03:50.287
in the skull and extremities.

03:50.322 --> 03:52.923
That puts time of death between
72 and 96 hours.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.259
So three or four days.
What's so weird about that?

03:55.293 --> 03:56.560
Because in the body cavity,
there's

03:56.595 --> 03:57.561
<i>Calliphoridae</i> larvae,
which indicates

03:57.596 --> 03:59.630
time of death
in the last three hours.

03:59.664 --> 04:01.304
Whoa! The body was found
long before that.

04:01.348 --> 04:02.600
Exactly.

04:02.601 --> 04:05.636
Which accounts for the
<i>Chrysomyarufifacies</i> in the feet,

04:05.670 --> 04:09.340
which puts time of death in
the last 14 days.

04:09.374 --> 04:13.010
Three hours, three days,
two weeks, right? What is it?

04:13.045 --> 04:14.278
Well, evidence says all three.

04:14.312 --> 04:16.514
That's not possible.

04:53.848 --> 04:56.883
So you have no idea
when she was killed?

04:56.918 --> 04:58.485
None at all.
We're looking for clues

04:58.519 --> 05:00.887
that can narrow it down.

05:00.922 --> 05:03.056
There's something lodged

05:03.091 --> 05:06.762
between the left maxillary
lateral incisor and the canine.

05:06.763 --> 05:08.183
I'm not sure how much
I'm gonna find.

05:08.184 --> 05:10.011
The swamp could have
swallowed up a lot of stuff.

05:10.012 --> 05:11.286
How long will
it take you

05:11.287 --> 05:13.532
to clean and reassemble
the skull, Mr. Vaziri?

05:13.533 --> 05:15.394
We need Angela to do
the reconstruction

05:15.419 --> 05:16.269
as soon as possible.

05:16.270 --> 05:17.938
You're still picking tissue
off the parietal.

05:17.972 --> 05:19.740
Don't you want
to finish that first?

05:19.774 --> 05:21.575
Oh, it's all yours, Mr. Vaziri.

05:21.609 --> 05:27.381
Is it me, or did it just get
totally awkward in here?

05:27.415 --> 05:29.683
It's probably the perplexing
nature of the remains.

05:29.717 --> 05:32.185
Uh, no. Actually, I think
it was the "Mr. Vaziri."

05:32.220 --> 05:34.755
What's going on here?
A murder case.

05:34.789 --> 05:36.323
So if we could focus on
the task at hand...

05:36.357 --> 05:38.258
The skull is
all yours, Mr....

05:38.292 --> 05:39.960
Arastoo.

05:39.994 --> 05:41.395
Thank you.

05:41.429 --> 05:43.563
Is something happening
that I don't understand?

05:43.598 --> 05:44.364
Yes.

05:44.399 --> 05:46.099
This is very odd.

05:46.134 --> 05:47.901
This tissue isn't
from the victim.

05:47.935 --> 05:50.015
It must have mixed in with
hers during decomposition.

05:50.037 --> 05:51.738
It could be evidence
of the assailant.

05:51.773 --> 05:53.373
Or a second victim.

05:53.408 --> 05:56.143
I'll run DNA and a tox screen
and see what I can find.

05:56.177 --> 05:59.346
Oh, Mr. Vaziri, bring up
the X rays of this area

05:59.380 --> 06:01.181
and tell me what you see.

06:05.753 --> 06:08.588
There appears to be
a remodeled injury

06:08.623 --> 06:11.091
to the right posterior
superior iliac crest.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.794
From a large-bore needle?
Yes.

06:13.828 --> 06:16.296
We can identify the victim
without a reconstruction.

06:16.330 --> 06:18.198
The victim had
a bone marrow aspiration

06:18.232 --> 06:20.100
approximately one year ago.

06:20.134 --> 06:22.702
Then I'll call the National
Bone Marrow Registry.

06:26.374 --> 06:28.909
Whew! So, the victim's name
is Madeline Papadelis.

06:28.943 --> 06:31.144
She'd been off the grid
for four months;

06:31.179 --> 06:32.946
no credit card information,
no cell phone information.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.381
No missing persons
report filed,

06:34.415 --> 06:36.650
no immediate family.
Do you have anything on her?

06:36.684 --> 06:38.485
Angela's sending over
more stuff.

06:38.519 --> 06:40.287
Whoa! Wait a second.
That more?

06:40.321 --> 06:42.122
Yes, sir.
SWEETS: This all about the victim?

06:42.156 --> 06:43.957
No, all of that is from
the assistant director.

06:43.991 --> 06:46.126
It's different.
He said no rush. If you could review 'em

06:46.160 --> 06:48.395
by the end of the week,
it should be fine.

06:48.429 --> 06:49.696
No rush?
There's over 50 cases here!

06:49.730 --> 06:51.331
I'm in the middle
of a murder investigation here.

06:51.365 --> 06:53.233
This has nothing
to do with me, sir.

06:53.267 --> 06:54.734
Oh, please,
you gotta be kidding me.

06:54.769 --> 06:56.603
I'm just delivering what I was told.
Right, okay.

06:56.637 --> 06:59.673
So, the assistant director's
having you review

06:59.707 --> 07:01.675
other agents' files?
That's-that's a big deal, Booth.

07:01.709 --> 07:04.044
It won't be if the person
who killed Madeline gets away.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.879
They don't ask just anyone to do that.
You know what?

07:05.913 --> 07:06.980
They're probably short-staffed.
They just want me

07:07.014 --> 07:08.482
to do double duty.
Uh, they could be

07:08.516 --> 07:10.183
looking at you for a promotion.
I tell you what.

07:10.218 --> 07:12.786
Why don't you just help me
with Madeline's case, all right?

07:12.820 --> 07:14.855
You have noticed I'm up
to my ears here in stuff.

07:14.889 --> 07:16.122
Sure.
Right, okay.

07:16.157 --> 07:17.457
So this is everything
that Angela

07:17.492 --> 07:19.259
has uncovered so far
about the case.

07:19.293 --> 07:21.761
She divorced, so any contact
with the ex-husband?

07:21.796 --> 07:23.890
Haven't located him yet.
Look at this.

07:23.915 --> 07:24.397
Hmm?

07:24.398 --> 07:28.201
What is this,
a tribute site to her kid?

07:28.236 --> 07:30.370
Yeah, her kid had
cystic fibrosis.

07:30.404 --> 07:32.739
She was only six years old.
She died 13 months ago.

07:32.773 --> 07:34.674
A lot of people give up
after something like that.

07:34.709 --> 07:35.909
They turn to drugs,

07:35.943 --> 07:37.777
anything to help them forget
about the pain.

07:37.812 --> 07:40.447
It's interesting that she
didn't have any clothes on.

07:40.481 --> 07:42.616
You're thinking
sexual assault?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.985
Or a sexual situation
that got out of hand.

07:45.019 --> 07:47.053
You know, sex can be used
as a way

07:47.088 --> 07:49.256
to numb yourself
from the pain, so...

07:49.290 --> 07:51.091
I got a text here. Oh.
What?

07:51.125 --> 07:53.193
Madeline took out a restraining
order on her ex-husband

07:53.227 --> 07:56.930
a year and a half ago.
He threatened to kill her.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.569
Hey, have you found a way
to determine time of death?

08:02.603 --> 08:05.305
No. It still technically
appears as if different parts

08:05.339 --> 08:07.107
of the body died
at different times.

08:07.141 --> 08:08.675
You?
Insect activity's telling me

08:08.709 --> 08:11.411
the same thing. I moved on
so I wouldn't feel stupid.

08:11.445 --> 08:13.580
So the fiber Dr. Brennan
found lodged

08:13.614 --> 08:15.515
in the victim's teeth
turned out to be chloroform.

08:15.550 --> 08:16.750
If the killer drugged

08:16.784 --> 08:18.151
Madeline before he killed her,

08:18.185 --> 08:19.920
maybe we're dealing
with a kidnapping.

08:19.954 --> 08:22.856
Could be. There were some
fibers found on her back

08:22.890 --> 08:24.724
made from silk and
cuprammonium rayon.

08:24.759 --> 08:26.927
The blend is used in WorldCore
sleeping bags.

08:26.961 --> 08:28.161
Drugged and zipped up

08:28.195 --> 08:30.463
in a sleeping bag.
It would explain

08:30.498 --> 08:32.032
being missing
for four months.

08:32.066 --> 08:34.100
Hey, I hear Arastoo's parents
are coming for a visit.

08:34.135 --> 08:36.001
Yeah. He hasn't seen them
in a long time.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.270
You gonna meet them?

08:37.304 --> 08:40.073
Haven't decided yet.
I don't want to intrude.

08:40.107 --> 08:41.408
He hasn't asked?

08:41.442 --> 08:43.208
No, he's asked.

08:43.244 --> 08:45.011
Oh, it's too loaded:
conflicting loyalties,

08:45.046 --> 08:46.246
you're not sure how

08:46.280 --> 08:47.847
that will play out.
I get it.

08:47.882 --> 08:50.283
It's not that big a deal, really.
That's what I said

08:50.318 --> 08:52.786
until Angela's father
knocked me out and tattooed me.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.688
Is that supposed
to be helping me?

08:54.722 --> 08:56.356
(computer trills)

08:56.390 --> 08:58.491
What's that?

08:58.526 --> 09:00.460
The DNA results
from the foreign tissue

09:00.494 --> 09:02.662
I found
on the victim.

09:05.099 --> 09:06.633
It's part of a tongue.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.535
A tongue?
That is creepy.

09:08.569 --> 09:11.838
A fox tongue, apparently.
And these samples appear

09:11.872 --> 09:13.340
to be from other
small scavengers.

09:13.374 --> 09:15.575
All somehow stuck to the victim.

09:15.610 --> 09:18.445
Maybe it was
a ritualistic killing.

09:18.479 --> 09:21.414
So, the ex-husband, he lives
in a cabin outside the city.

09:21.449 --> 09:23.116
Another agent's
bringing him in.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.684
Because you're still working
on other agents' cases?

09:24.719 --> 09:26.319
Look, every time I say no,

09:26.354 --> 09:28.388
the assistant director says
he can't get along without me.

09:28.422 --> 09:30.991
I feel the same way.

09:31.025 --> 09:33.460
What if they promote you
to a desk job?

09:33.494 --> 09:35.695
Are they gonna give me
another partner?

09:35.730 --> 09:38.264
Look, I am not gonna be
promoted to a desk job, okay?

09:38.299 --> 09:40.567
Plus, you're not gonna get
a new partner.

09:40.601 --> 09:41.935
They're not gonna promote you

09:41.969 --> 09:43.803
and leave you
in the same position.

09:43.838 --> 09:45.472
Look, everyone is just getting
way ahead

09:45.506 --> 09:46.806
of themselves right now,
all right?

09:46.841 --> 09:48.541
I'm just doing
this guy a favor.

09:48.576 --> 09:52.646
(phone rings) Just figuring out,
looking at ex-cases. Booth.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.681
Yeah, great. On our way.

09:54.715 --> 09:56.650
Bringing in the ex-husband.
Come with me?

09:56.684 --> 09:58.184
Why?
Why?

09:58.219 --> 10:00.387
Because you're my partner.
(clicks tongue)

10:01.756 --> 10:04.424
I can't believe Madeline's dead.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.259
Oy, save the tears, okay?

10:06.293 --> 10:08.828
You haven't contacted your ex
in over, what, four months?

10:08.863 --> 10:10.630
Because she had
a restraining order against me.

10:10.665 --> 10:12.132
Because you tried to kill her.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.867
No, that is not true.
We fought,

10:13.901 --> 10:15.769
I was cleaning my rifle
and I waved it around.

10:15.803 --> 10:17.470
What were you fighting about?

10:17.505 --> 10:19.339
Same thing we always
fought about--

10:19.373 --> 10:22.242
our little girl, Karine.

10:22.276 --> 10:24.611
Madeline wanted
to put her through

10:24.645 --> 10:26.212
all these god-awful
treatments.

10:26.247 --> 10:29.215
And since she had full custody,
I couldn't do anything about it.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.250
Must've been angry, huh?

10:30.284 --> 10:31.685
Yeah, wouldn't you be?

10:31.719 --> 10:36.122
She was torturing my daughter,
even-even after the doctors said

10:36.157 --> 10:38.458
she'd never get any better.

10:38.492 --> 10:40.360
You're a hunter,
aren't you, Mr. Papadelis?

10:40.394 --> 10:42.028
That illegal?
We found the tongues

10:42.063 --> 10:45.231
and snouts of small animals
on your ex-wife's remains.

10:45.266 --> 10:47.133
So you think...?

10:48.302 --> 10:49.869
You're crazy!

10:49.904 --> 10:51.304
Maybe you tortured
your ex

10:51.338 --> 10:53.106
the way you thought she tortured
your daughter.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.442
No.
If you're innocent,

10:55.476 --> 10:57.110
I'm sure you'd be happy
to let us examine

10:57.144 --> 10:58.578
your camping equipment and guns.

10:58.612 --> 10:59.646
I'm a member of the NRA.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.514
I know my rights.

11:01.549 --> 11:03.750
You need a warrant.
Oh, right.

11:03.784 --> 11:05.452
That's right, a warrant.
Like this one here?

11:05.486 --> 11:06.786
Here you go. Look at that.

11:06.821 --> 11:08.722
That okay for you,
Mr. Huntsman?

11:14.363 --> 11:17.826
Hey.
Okay, initially I thought

11:17.827 --> 11:20.028
the damage to the organs
was caused by predation,

11:20.063 --> 11:21.930
animals tearing them apart.

11:21.965 --> 11:23.866
But these are
actually fractures.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.940
All right, I'm not Dr. B,
but organs don't fracture.

11:25.969 --> 11:27.002
Only bones do.

11:27.036 --> 11:28.303
Unless the organs were frozen.

11:28.338 --> 11:30.372
I also found urine
in the bladder,

11:30.406 --> 11:31.807
which a normal body would expel.

11:31.841 --> 11:33.675
Unless it was frozen
very soon after death.

11:33.710 --> 11:35.010
Freezing.

11:35.044 --> 11:36.912
Freezing would account
for the various insect

11:36.946 --> 11:39.014
and larval stages I found.

11:39.048 --> 11:40.315
And would explain
why the animals didn't feed

11:40.350 --> 11:41.617
on the torso and organs first.

11:41.651 --> 11:43.152
Yeah, they were
the last to thaw.

11:43.186 --> 11:44.653
Which also explains the tongues

11:44.687 --> 11:45.888
and tissue from the scavengers.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.156
If they tried to feed

11:47.190 --> 11:48.323
on the organs when
they were frozen,

11:48.358 --> 11:49.825
their tongues would stick.
Yeah.

11:49.859 --> 11:50.859
And would tear off
as they were pulling away.

11:50.894 --> 11:51.994
Wow, so what?

11:52.028 --> 11:53.128
Someone had her locked
in a freezer

11:53.163 --> 11:54.296
for the past four months?

11:54.330 --> 11:55.998
Well, that would be
the easy answer.

11:56.032 --> 11:58.033
I've worked a lot of mob hits,
and they love to freeze.

11:58.067 --> 11:59.902
But I've never seen a freezer

11:59.936 --> 12:02.638
cold enough to fracture a liver.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.909
BOOTH:
<i>Frozen?</i>

12:06.943 --> 12:09.068
It appears that way, although
I haven't found any evidence

12:09.069 --> 12:09.546
Whoa.

12:09.547 --> 12:13.382
of microstructural changes
caused by liquid expansion.

12:13.416 --> 12:15.350
That usually
accompanies freezing,

12:15.385 --> 12:17.152
which is why I'm doing a
histological study of the bones.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.353
Well, psych profiles

12:18.388 --> 12:20.322
of killers that
freeze their victims

12:20.356 --> 12:22.024
kind of go all over the place.

12:22.058 --> 12:23.358
I mean, the killer could
have frozen the victim

12:23.393 --> 12:24.860
to obscure time of death.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.061
So, that's
what happened here, isn't it?

12:26.095 --> 12:27.663
Or the killer

12:27.697 --> 12:29.665
could've put the body
on ice until they found

12:29.699 --> 12:31.366
a more convenient time
to dispose of it.

12:31.401 --> 12:32.834
Or both.
That's a very good point.

12:32.869 --> 12:33.936
That's why the assistant
director asked

12:33.970 --> 12:35.237
for your advice. And mine.

12:35.271 --> 12:37.139
If Sweets is going
over cases, too,

12:37.173 --> 12:39.641
perhaps it's not
about a promotion.

12:39.676 --> 12:41.310
I'm gonna pretend
that wasn't insulting.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.679
So, the assistant director
asked me to review

12:43.713 --> 12:45.214
your test results

12:45.248 --> 12:47.216
and your latest psych profile.
What?

12:47.250 --> 12:48.717
He wants me to
make an analysis

12:48.751 --> 12:50.052
of your performance
and capabilities.

12:50.086 --> 12:51.320
And you're allowed
to tell me that?

12:51.354 --> 12:53.222
Nobody said it
was confidential.

12:53.256 --> 12:54.189
Well, what else do you know?

12:54.224 --> 12:55.524
Um, nothing official yet.

12:55.558 --> 12:56.658
But I heard
that they're staffing

12:56.693 --> 12:58.794
a new field office in Germany.

12:58.828 --> 13:00.462
They need someone to run it.
Germany?

13:00.496 --> 13:01.730
The FBI is a domestic agency.

13:01.764 --> 13:03.398
BOOTH:
Well, not exclusively.

13:03.433 --> 13:05.267
I mean, when there are suspected
terrorists or attacks

13:05.301 --> 13:08.604
against embassies or consulates,
the FBI always responds.

13:08.638 --> 13:09.838
That's more

13:09.872 --> 13:10.906
than a regular promotion, Booth.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.075
That sounds like a big honor.

13:13.109 --> 13:14.710
Well, how long
would the tour be?

13:14.744 --> 13:15.877
I heard two years.
I'm not leaving you

13:15.912 --> 13:17.980
and Christine,
so it's not gonna happen.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.581
You've clearly excelled
at your job, Booth.

13:19.616 --> 13:21.483
You should allow yourself
to be recognized in that way.

13:21.517 --> 13:23.785
Oh, I-I have to get
back to the lab.

13:23.820 --> 13:25.153
Uh, we can talk
about this later.

13:25.188 --> 13:27.589
There's nothing to talk about.

13:27.624 --> 13:29.358
You sound defensive, Booth.
I'm not defensive.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.759
I'm starting
to get annoyed, okay?

13:30.793 --> 13:32.354
People are way ahead
of themselves here.

13:32.362 --> 13:34.830
Okay.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.301
Booth got Madeline's
credit card records.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.436
She spent practically nothing.

13:41.471 --> 13:45.340
The one consistent charge were
her bus passes from the MTA.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.908
She got the last one
five months ago.

13:46.943 --> 13:49.077
Just before she disappeared.

13:49.112 --> 13:52.247
The first purchase was made
just after her daughter died.

13:52.282 --> 13:54.349
She only used them on
Saturdays when she took

13:54.384 --> 13:55.951
the round trip
to Vienna, Virginia.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.519
Looks like her last trip
was four months ago

13:57.553 --> 13:59.187
when she disappeared.

13:59.222 --> 14:01.490
Yeah, and there was no
return ride for that trip.

14:01.524 --> 14:03.692
Huh. Well...

14:03.726 --> 14:05.961
we still haven't ruled out
sexual assault, you know.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.963
I mean, Sweets says
some grieving victims

14:07.997 --> 14:09.631
turn to sex
to dull the pain.

14:09.666 --> 14:12.434
So, you think she was going
up there to meet someone?

14:12.468 --> 14:15.137
Maybe, and maybe that person
got a little too kinky,

14:15.171 --> 14:17.973
and chloroformed
and abducted her.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:27.450 --> 14:28.884
How's the skull coming along?

14:28.918 --> 14:30.152
More slowly than I

14:30.186 --> 14:31.653
or Dr. Brennan would want.

14:31.688 --> 14:33.655
The missing pieces
aren't helping, either.

14:33.690 --> 14:36.658
Well, I'm sure
you'll do a fine job.

14:36.693 --> 14:39.461
That was oddly polite.

14:39.495 --> 14:41.596
Yeah.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.865
Sorry. I...

14:49.172 --> 14:51.006
This may not be
the time or the place,

14:51.040 --> 14:54.209
but I think it's better
if I didn't go to dinner

14:54.243 --> 14:55.644
with you and your parents.

14:55.678 --> 14:57.045
How would that be better?
I love you.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.146
I want them to meet you.

14:58.181 --> 14:59.381
Well, you love
your parents, too.

14:59.415 --> 15:01.783
And what they think means
a lot to you.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.018
Cam...
You told me what happened when

15:03.052 --> 15:04.186
your brother introduced

15:04.220 --> 15:05.554
his girlfriend.
They broke up, right?

15:05.588 --> 15:08.824
That was different.
You hope.

15:08.858 --> 15:10.359
But I don't want to be
there when you're forced

15:10.393 --> 15:12.661
to choose between them or me.

15:12.695 --> 15:15.030
Have a little faith in me.

15:15.064 --> 15:17.699
Unless you're too scared.

15:17.734 --> 15:19.701
What's that supposed to mean?

15:19.736 --> 15:21.370
BRENNAN: I have the results
of the histological.

15:21.404 --> 15:24.906
What do you notice
about the findings, Mr. Vaziri?

15:26.976 --> 15:28.643
There's no crystallization.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.212
Precisely.
What exactly

15:30.246 --> 15:31.947
does that mean?
Well, normally when a body

15:31.981 --> 15:33.148
is frozen, ice crystals
form from the water

15:33.182 --> 15:34.716
in the body,
rupturing the cells.

15:34.751 --> 15:36.218
The histological shows
there is no rupturing.

15:36.252 --> 15:37.386
But if the body wasn't frozen,

15:37.420 --> 15:39.054
then none of our findings
make sense.

15:39.088 --> 15:40.088
That is not my conclusion.

15:40.123 --> 15:41.857
The victim was frozen,

15:41.891 --> 15:43.358
but also vitrified.

15:43.393 --> 15:44.793
The water in the
body is replaced

15:44.827 --> 15:46.161
by cryoprotective chemicals,

15:46.195 --> 15:48.163
which is why
there were no ice crystals.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.165
She was cryogenically frozen?

15:50.199 --> 15:53.201
At temperatures well below
negative 100 degrees Celsius.

15:53.236 --> 15:55.103
Which explains
why the organs fractured.

15:55.138 --> 15:57.906
It actually explains
everything we've seen.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.975
Except who killed her and how.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.615
BOOTH: <i>Look, there's a</i>
<i>cryo-whatever-you-call-it place</i>

16:06.649 --> 16:07.816
in Vienna, Virginia,
just a block from where

16:07.850 --> 16:08.817
she took her bus trips.

16:08.851 --> 16:10.419
And it's called cryonics.

16:10.453 --> 16:12.821
It's the low-temperature
preservation of humans

16:12.855 --> 16:15.724
with the hope
that resuscitation

16:15.758 --> 16:17.392
may be possible
in the future.

16:17.427 --> 16:18.827
It's nuts, okay?
When you die,

16:18.861 --> 16:20.829
it's ashes to ashes,
not ashes to ice.

16:20.863 --> 16:23.064
We all search for immortality
in our own way.

16:23.099 --> 16:25.367
It's what binds
tribes and religions.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.570
Just please tell me that
you're not gonna want me

16:28.604 --> 16:30.038
to freeze you.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.940
No, but

16:31.974 --> 16:33.809
one day you might
be able to download

16:33.843 --> 16:36.044
my accumulated consciousness
onto a memory chip.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.512
Listen.

16:37.547 --> 16:40.282
Let's just, you know,
keep each other in here.

16:40.316 --> 16:43.652
That's worked just
fine for a long time.

16:43.686 --> 16:46.822
You know, Christine and I

16:46.856 --> 16:48.924
could come to Germany, too.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.459
But you know I wouldn't
ask you to do that.

16:50.493 --> 16:51.493
Your work is here.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.161
So, you'd stand in the way

16:53.196 --> 16:57.065
of us having a new and possibly
life-changing experience?

16:57.099 --> 16:59.634
That seems selfish, Booth.

17:00.837 --> 17:02.971
What, you'd really
uproot everything?

17:03.005 --> 17:06.040
Wouldn't you?

17:09.612 --> 17:11.413
BOOTH:
<i>I kind of figured this place</i>

17:11.446 --> 17:13.248
would be more hospitally, right?

17:13.281 --> 17:15.250
A little bit more,
I don't know, sterile?

17:15.284 --> 17:18.185
Cryonics operations have
very little funding.

17:18.221 --> 17:20.355
Most of their funding comes

17:20.388 --> 17:22.557
from member donations.

17:22.592 --> 17:24.159
Member donations?

17:24.193 --> 17:25.926
I don't know if they
have a lot of members.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.429
Actually, we have over 700

17:27.463 --> 17:30.832
full- and part-time members.
Right. And you are...?

17:30.867 --> 17:32.567
I am Dr. Noah Summers.
This is my wife, Michelle.

17:32.602 --> 17:34.503
We own CryoNova.

17:34.537 --> 17:35.670
Your turn.

17:35.705 --> 17:37.205
FBI Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.773
This here is my partner,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.475
Dr. Brennan.

17:40.510 --> 17:42.477
I'm thrilled that you're
interested in our services.

17:42.512 --> 17:43.979
It would be my honor
to preserve your brain.

17:44.013 --> 17:45.580
BRENNAN:
I'm sure it would.

17:45.615 --> 17:47.382
But at this point, cryonics is

17:47.416 --> 17:48.917
nothing more than a fantasy.

17:48.951 --> 17:49.951
MICHELLE:
As is often the case

17:49.986 --> 17:52.153
before great discoveries.

17:52.188 --> 17:53.688
So if you're not interested
in being preserved,

17:53.723 --> 17:55.357
how can we help you?

17:55.391 --> 17:56.958
Do you know a woman by the name
of Madeline Papadelis?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.126
Of course.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.327
She used to visit all the time.

17:59.362 --> 18:01.496
Her daughter is one
of our patients.

18:01.531 --> 18:03.632
BOOTH:
Her daughter is dead.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.134
Technically she's in a state
of suspended animation.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.303
Well, not her mother.
Technically, she is dead dead.

18:08.337 --> 18:10.605
She was found in a swamp
outside Alexandria.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.207
What?
BRENNAN: And all the evidence indicates

18:12.241 --> 18:14.442
that she was
cryogenically frozen.

18:15.037 --> 18:17.171
Here.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.525
We haven't seen
Madeline in months.

18:20.526 --> 18:21.593
She used to come here
every Saturday

18:21.627 --> 18:22.961
to visit her daughter.

18:22.995 --> 18:25.296
Her daughter who is
dead who isn't dead.

18:25.331 --> 18:26.998
Yes, Madeline was dedicated
to our cause.

18:27.032 --> 18:29.367
She and I were working on
a proposal for a funding grant.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.569
And then she just disappeared.

18:31.604 --> 18:32.871
We tried to contact her,
but she never answered

18:32.905 --> 18:34.772
her voice mails or texts.

18:34.807 --> 18:36.574
We waived the storage
fees for her daughter

18:36.609 --> 18:38.209
until we could locate her.

18:38.244 --> 18:39.677
Man, these tanks are huge.

18:39.712 --> 18:42.013
I mean, why do you need so
much space for one body?

18:42.047 --> 18:43.214
Well, we can store
up to five

18:43.249 --> 18:44.816
whole body preservations

18:44.850 --> 18:46.484
in one dewar.

18:46.519 --> 18:48.186
Or a couple dozen neuros.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.314
Neuros?
Heads.

18:50.315 --> 18:51.448
They remove
and freeze the head.

18:51.482 --> 18:52.950
Don't need to know that. Okay.

18:52.984 --> 18:54.251
You know what? You guys
are in the business

18:54.285 --> 18:56.119
of freezing people.
The victim was frozen.

18:56.154 --> 18:57.347
So therefore,
I need to shut you down.

18:57.348 --> 18:58.448
No.
God, no.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.324
We have patients to care for.

19:00.358 --> 19:01.725
We have others contracted to come in.
So?

19:01.759 --> 19:02.793
Why aren't you
talking to Warshaw?

19:02.827 --> 19:04.194
We've already lodged

19:04.229 --> 19:05.929
a complaint with the police,
and so has Madeline.

19:05.964 --> 19:07.864
Who is Warshaw?
Tripp Warshaw.

19:07.899 --> 19:09.299
He's another cryonicist
in Maryland.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.401
He stored patients
in his garage.

19:11.436 --> 19:12.569
Garage?

19:12.604 --> 19:13.870
Wait a second, wait.

19:13.905 --> 19:16.106
Who licenses you guys,
Frankenstein?

19:16.140 --> 19:18.408
They're licensed
as cemeteries,

19:18.443 --> 19:19.643
which have
very little oversight.

19:19.677 --> 19:20.978
Warshaw went
out of business.

19:21.012 --> 19:22.446
Blamed us for taking
his patients.

19:22.480 --> 19:23.847
Including Madeline's daughter.

19:23.881 --> 19:25.115
He shot out our lock
and tried to break in

19:25.149 --> 19:26.683
and sabotage the facility.

19:26.718 --> 19:27.851
I can show you.

19:27.885 --> 19:29.386
All right, look,
was he arrested?

19:29.420 --> 19:30.520
No, they said

19:30.555 --> 19:32.022
there wasn't enough proof.

19:32.056 --> 19:34.358
But now with Madeline's death?

19:34.392 --> 19:36.760
You should talk to him.

19:36.794 --> 19:38.495
Hmm.

19:38.529 --> 19:40.697
SAROYAN: <i>I'm gonna need you both</i>
<i>to go to CryoNova.</i>

19:40.732 --> 19:43.533
Angela, I'm gonna need you
to access their digital records.

19:43.568 --> 19:45.168
And, Hodgins,
I need you to catalog

19:45.203 --> 19:46.637
any drugs and chemicals
they used.

19:46.671 --> 19:48.338
Wait, drugs?

19:48.373 --> 19:49.973
They're dead when they're
frozen, aren't they?

19:50.008 --> 19:51.508
Yes, but they keep
oxygen circulating

19:51.542 --> 19:52.942
while putting
in the cryoprotectants

19:52.944 --> 19:56.380
to save the cellular
integrity of the remains.

19:56.414 --> 19:57.748
And they use propofol
to keep the remains

19:57.782 --> 19:59.016
from animating
during the process.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.284
Animating?

20:00.318 --> 20:02.719
You-you mean
like the walking dead?

20:02.754 --> 20:04.121
Yeah, it's actually...

20:04.155 --> 20:05.455
If you say cool,
you won't have sex

20:05.490 --> 20:06.590
for, like, a year.

20:06.624 --> 20:07.958
Revolting.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.326
It's totally revolting.

20:09.360 --> 20:10.494
Are you ready?

20:10.528 --> 20:13.196
One second.

20:13.231 --> 20:15.432
Well, the dinner is on, huh?

20:15.466 --> 20:17.734
Does everyone know about this?
Absolutely.

20:17.769 --> 20:20.103
It's all we can talk about.
So I'm not the only one who's

20:20.138 --> 20:21.705
a little sensitive
around their parents?

20:21.739 --> 20:23.106
Okay, then.

20:23.141 --> 20:24.875
You can cut me
a little slack.

20:24.909 --> 20:26.510
This is gonna be fine, right?

20:26.544 --> 20:27.577
Right, 'cause you didn't make

20:27.612 --> 20:29.112
this seem awful at all.

20:29.147 --> 20:31.114
You're not going to make
this easy on me, are you?

20:31.149 --> 20:32.916
MONTENEGRO: Okay, you
guys should probably go.

20:32.950 --> 20:34.651
Parents don't like
when the kids are late.

20:34.686 --> 20:36.887
Right.
Right.

20:39.524 --> 20:40.457
It's gonna be fine.

20:40.491 --> 20:43.160
Right.

20:43.194 --> 20:45.462
(quiet laugh)

20:47.065 --> 20:50.033
BRENNAN:
<i>Madeline Papadelis</i>

20:50.068 --> 20:52.736
was going to place her daughter
in your care originally,

20:52.770 --> 20:54.538
wasn't she, Mr. Warshaw?

20:54.572 --> 20:57.174
Before CryoNova
poached her, yeah.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.576
So, you blame them
for your business going under.

20:59.610 --> 21:01.945
All they care
about is the bottom line.

21:01.979 --> 21:04.014
I'm all about the science,
and not just cryonics,

21:04.048 --> 21:06.516
but biological immortality.

21:06.551 --> 21:08.418
I'm currently studying
the tardigrades,

21:08.453 --> 21:10.520
which are extremophiles.

21:10.555 --> 21:11.688
You-you believe
there's a connection

21:11.723 --> 21:13.857
between them
and cellular senescence

21:13.891 --> 21:16.159
as a function
of chronological age?

21:16.194 --> 21:17.294
We're all made out
of the same stuff.

21:17.328 --> 21:19.096
Ah, hold it
there, pal, okay?

21:19.130 --> 21:21.565
I am definitely not made out of
the same stuff as you, trust me.

21:21.599 --> 21:23.834
Actually we're all
carbon-based organisms.

21:23.868 --> 21:26.169
Really? Do we have
to discuss that right now?

21:26.204 --> 21:28.171
It's not the time. So, we looked
at your credit report, Tripp.

21:28.206 --> 21:29.773
It turns out that

21:29.807 --> 21:31.842
every business
that you bought equipment from

21:31.876 --> 21:33.810
is suing you.
I owed money.

21:33.845 --> 21:36.012
Because CryoNova poached
all my clients.

21:36.047 --> 21:38.148
Because Madeline backed out.

21:38.182 --> 21:41.218
Her daughter was your last hope.

21:41.252 --> 21:43.420
Wasn't she?

21:43.454 --> 21:45.822
You got angry.
Wouldn't you be angry?

21:45.857 --> 21:47.257
I was working with new methods,

21:47.291 --> 21:48.592
better methods

21:48.626 --> 21:50.093
of cryonic stabilization.

21:50.128 --> 21:51.795
Is that why you shot
your way into CryoNova?

21:51.829 --> 21:53.063
I didn't!

21:53.097 --> 21:54.798
The police never
arrested me for that.

21:54.832 --> 21:55.899
I understand someone standing

21:55.933 --> 21:57.467
in the way of new discoveries.

21:57.502 --> 21:59.803
Researchers and professors
often assault one another.

21:59.837 --> 22:01.972
Murder is not unheard of.

22:03.274 --> 22:04.408
Murder?

22:04.442 --> 22:05.742
BOOTH:
Madeline.

22:05.777 --> 22:07.477
Four months ago.
Then she was frozen.

22:07.512 --> 22:08.945
BRENNAN:
And then discarded

22:08.980 --> 22:10.547
four days ago,
when you were finally

22:10.581 --> 22:13.784
supposed to have
your equipment repossessed.

22:22.026 --> 22:23.794
Arastoo has told
Armin and myself

22:23.828 --> 22:25.862
a great deal about you.

22:25.897 --> 22:27.397
All good, I hope,
Khanome Vaziri.

22:27.432 --> 22:28.331
Don't call me that...

22:28.366 --> 22:30.434
Mamaan.

22:31.636 --> 22:34.404
I meant, call me Azita.

22:35.506 --> 22:37.941
ARMIN:
You are a surgeon,

22:37.975 --> 22:40.243
Dr. Saroyan?
Oh, please, call me Cam.

22:40.278 --> 22:41.745
I told you,
she's a coroner,

22:41.779 --> 22:43.213
which is a very respected
profession, Baba.

22:43.247 --> 22:44.448
SAROYAN:
I can speak

22:44.482 --> 22:45.715
for myself, Arastoo.

22:45.750 --> 22:48.819
So you handle dead bodies,
as our son does.

22:48.853 --> 22:50.120
SAROYAN:
Yes.

22:50.154 --> 22:51.955
Although he focuses
more on bones.

22:51.989 --> 22:54.691
I deal more with tissue
and organs and stuff.

22:54.725 --> 22:56.927
I-It's probably not
dinner conversation.

22:56.961 --> 22:58.995
We're here to get to know
each other, aren't we?

22:59.030 --> 23:00.831
I've told my son

23:00.865 --> 23:02.232
I can't imagine

23:02.266 --> 23:04.801
being consumed with death
all the time.

23:04.836 --> 23:07.170
SAROYAN: Oh, there's so much more
to our lives than death.

23:07.205 --> 23:09.639
We go to concerts and museums,

23:09.674 --> 23:11.775
and we laugh...

23:13.010 --> 23:15.645
I know that look.

23:17.181 --> 23:19.182
Do you plan on having children?

23:19.217 --> 23:20.484
Oh...

23:20.518 --> 23:22.986
None of you
are getting any younger.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.855
Mamaan.
You should apologize.

23:24.889 --> 23:27.190
Now biology is
your mother's fault?

23:27.225 --> 23:28.725
SAROYAN:
I actually already

23:28.759 --> 23:30.627
have a daughter.
She's in college.

23:30.661 --> 23:32.462
ARMIN:
Oh.

23:32.497 --> 23:34.030
You were married before.

23:34.065 --> 23:35.298
SAROYAN:
No, she's the, um...

23:35.333 --> 23:36.900
child of
a man

23:36.934 --> 23:38.835
that I lived with
for a few years.

23:38.870 --> 23:40.170
He passed away...

23:40.204 --> 23:41.838
It's, uh, complicated.
I love her

23:41.873 --> 23:43.240
very much,

23:43.274 --> 23:45.575
and your son
is wonderful with her.

23:46.711 --> 23:48.545
Funny that he didn't mention

23:48.579 --> 23:50.247
that he had a child in his life.

23:50.281 --> 23:52.883
Perhaps I didn't want
the questions and judgments.

23:54.919 --> 23:57.587
So you keeping secrets--
this is also our fault.

23:57.622 --> 24:00.290
Can I take your order?
Yes, please. Um...

24:00.324 --> 24:02.659
I haven't even looked
at the menu yet.

24:03.828 --> 24:06.596
Do you have
someplace else to go?

24:08.466 --> 24:10.433
I'll give you another minute.

24:12.870 --> 24:15.839
I imagine Persian food
is quite foreign to you.

24:15.873 --> 24:17.040
SAROYAN:
Arastoo is actually

24:17.074 --> 24:18.308
quite a good cook.

24:18.342 --> 24:19.876
His, uh, Ghalieh Mahi
is my favorite.

24:19.911 --> 24:21.611
ARMIN:
Mamaan taught him.

24:21.646 --> 24:24.214
I'm surprised
you like it.

24:24.248 --> 24:26.716
Cultural differences can
sometimes be difficult to...

24:26.751 --> 24:28.818
Fine.
We get it.

24:28.853 --> 24:31.021
We're too different from each other.
She-she has a child,

24:31.055 --> 24:33.823
our professions are repulsive,
it'll never work.

24:33.858 --> 24:35.725
Well, I love her. And that's all
that matters to me.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.528
(speaking Farsi): 
I won't let you two destroy

24:38.563 --> 24:40.363
my relationship
with my girlfriend

24:40.398 --> 24:41.865
with your old-fashioned
thoughts, the way you did

24:41.899 --> 24:43.833
with Hamid.
You aren't ashamed when you talk

24:43.868 --> 24:45.602
to me like this?
No, I am not ashamed. Why should I?

24:45.636 --> 24:47.237
No, he didn't destroy;
you guys did it.

24:47.271 --> 24:48.705
Who? We destroyed Hamid's
relationship or Hamid did it

24:48.739 --> 24:49.939
with himself?
Who did it, then?

24:49.941 --> 24:51.174
Arastoo, don't do this!
No, you guys destroyed

24:51.208 --> 24:52.175
his life.
You make me embarrassed

24:52.209 --> 24:53.476
in front of other people.
Let's go.

24:53.511 --> 24:54.878
Just go, be ashamed.

24:54.912 --> 24:57.581
Go. Go.
Um, wow, it was nice to meet you.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.439
Have you been here
all night, Mr. Vaziri?

25:22.473 --> 25:23.907
Most of the
night, yeah.

25:23.941 --> 25:26.610
Cam is pretty upset, so...

25:26.644 --> 25:27.911
Because of your parents?

25:27.945 --> 25:29.713
Yes.

25:29.747 --> 25:31.448
I believe on some level

25:31.482 --> 25:33.516
our parents are supposed
to disappoint us

25:33.551 --> 25:35.018
so we can

25:35.052 --> 25:36.820
surpass them
and improve the species.

25:36.854 --> 25:39.089
So put your dinner
in perspective.

25:39.123 --> 25:40.657
It was an
evolutionary necessity.

25:40.691 --> 25:41.791
I understand

25:41.826 --> 25:43.393
you found something?
I did.

25:43.427 --> 25:45.428
There's an excessive
amount of exfoliation

25:45.463 --> 25:47.530
on this tibia.
Huh.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.968
There does
appear to be

25:52.003 --> 25:53.570
significantly
more flaking

25:53.604 --> 25:55.672
on the cortical bone
than I would expect to see.

25:55.706 --> 25:57.040
Did you find it
anywhere else?

25:57.074 --> 25:59.209
The metatarsals and tarsals
of the same leg.

25:59.243 --> 26:00.477
The excessive

26:00.511 --> 26:02.145
yet isolated exfoliation

26:02.179 --> 26:03.713
indicates a lack of equilibrium

26:03.748 --> 26:05.715
in the vitrification process.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.517
The perfusion of
the cryoprotectant

26:07.551 --> 26:08.952
at the time of freezing wasn't completed?
Precisely.

26:08.986 --> 26:10.453
The killer either
used equipment

26:10.488 --> 26:12.155
that hadn't been
serviced properly,

26:12.189 --> 26:13.390
or he was in a rush.

26:13.424 --> 26:14.924
And the skull?

26:14.959 --> 26:16.459
Dr. Hodgins is still picking
things out of the muck.

26:16.494 --> 26:18.228
If he doesn't find
any more bone fragments,

26:18.262 --> 26:19.629
this is all we'll have.

26:20.631 --> 26:22.565
SWEETS:
<i>So it turns out</i>

26:22.600 --> 26:24.167
Tripp Warshaw
was in Phoenix

26:24.201 --> 26:25.468
when the victim
disappeared.

26:25.503 --> 26:27.037
He was working at some
longevity institute.

26:27.071 --> 26:28.505
Well, that makes sense,
because ballistics says

26:28.539 --> 26:29.873
the bullet wasn't his.

26:29.907 --> 26:31.547
It was from a gun
owned by the ex-husband?

26:31.575 --> 26:32.842
Yeah. I'm gonna
go talk to him now.

26:32.877 --> 26:34.544
Booth.
Uh...

26:34.578 --> 26:35.879
so the deputy director's office

26:35.913 --> 26:37.681
asked me to take a look
at your military record,

26:37.715 --> 26:39.783
factor that into my analysis.

26:39.817 --> 26:40.917
<i>The</i> deputy director?
Yeah.

26:40.951 --> 26:42.285
So it <i>is</i> moving up.

26:42.319 --> 26:43.687
Mm-hmm. You don't seem

26:43.721 --> 26:45.088
too happy about that.
Look, all the reports

26:45.122 --> 26:46.589
that they have
me looking at

26:46.624 --> 26:48.124
are from other shootings,
from other agents.

26:48.159 --> 26:49.559
They want to know how
I would have handled them.

26:49.593 --> 26:50.860
Because of
your past.

26:50.895 --> 26:52.135
That's probably why they had me

26:52.163 --> 26:53.697
take a look at
your military record.

26:53.731 --> 26:55.165
I'm sure there aren't
a lot of candidates

26:55.199 --> 26:56.399
with your skill set.

26:56.434 --> 26:58.435
Exactly.

26:58.469 --> 27:01.004
Sit down, Ethan.

27:02.940 --> 27:04.674
Look, you lied to us.

27:04.709 --> 27:06.609
Why didn't you tell us that
your daughter was frozen?

27:06.644 --> 27:08.611
That is nobody's business but mine.
It is my business

27:08.646 --> 27:10.680
when you shoot up
the facility that she was stored in.

27:10.715 --> 27:12.282
She shouldn't
be in there.

27:12.316 --> 27:14.718
She should be buried
the way God intended.

27:14.752 --> 27:16.119
Why did you lie to me?
Because I've got two strikes,

27:16.153 --> 27:17.620
felony assault,
against me.

27:17.655 --> 27:20.490
One more and
I'm going away for real time.

27:20.524 --> 27:22.158
What do you think
you're going to be facing

27:22.193 --> 27:23.760
when I charge you with
the murder of your ex-wife?

27:23.794 --> 27:25.762
I went in there
to get Karine.

27:25.796 --> 27:27.230
To bury her proper.

27:27.264 --> 27:28.865
But have you
seen that place?

27:28.899 --> 27:31.167
All those metal things?
I couldn't figure out

27:31.202 --> 27:32.370
how to get my baby out of there.

27:32.395 --> 27:33.269
And when that didn't
work out for you,

27:33.270 --> 27:35.805
the only thing left for you
to do was get revenge.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.440
If I couldn't think
how to get Karine

27:37.475 --> 27:39.008
out of one
of those things,

27:39.043 --> 27:41.611
how the hell could I have
put Madeline into one?

27:45.249 --> 27:46.916
You wanted
to see me?

27:46.951 --> 27:49.552
I reviewed the security footage
from CryoNova.

27:49.587 --> 27:51.921
Let me pull it up.

27:51.956 --> 27:54.791
I heard dinner
wasn't so good.

27:54.825 --> 27:56.593
Ugh. Dinner would
imply food.

27:56.627 --> 27:58.094
We didn't get that far.

27:58.129 --> 27:59.929
But we're trying to put it
all behind us,

27:59.964 --> 28:01.765
so I'd rather not talk
about it at work.

28:01.799 --> 28:02.999
Sure.

28:03.033 --> 28:04.834
Okay, so...

28:04.869 --> 28:06.770
look who Madeline
was arguing with

28:06.804 --> 28:08.705
the Saturday before
she was killed.

28:08.739 --> 28:10.340
SAROYAN: What are they
arguing about?

28:10.374 --> 28:12.008
MONTENEGRO:
There's no sound.

28:12.042 --> 28:14.177
But look at this.

28:18.649 --> 28:21.251
SAROYAN: Holy... Okay,
what is happening?

28:23.821 --> 28:26.656
Your guess is
as good as mine.

28:33.164 --> 28:35.832
Madeline was a true believer.

28:35.866 --> 28:37.433
If she caught Noah
messing around

28:37.468 --> 28:39.202
with the patients
in his charge...

28:39.236 --> 28:41.304
He looks like a monster.

28:41.338 --> 28:43.840
God only knows
what he would do.

28:45.487 --> 28:47.199
Madeline caught you
sawing into patients

28:47.200 --> 28:48.868
and threatened to turn you in.
Do you know how much

28:48.902 --> 28:52.078
a full body preservation costs?
$200,000.

28:52.232 --> 28:53.900
When that patient's wife died,

28:53.934 --> 28:55.968
payments stopped.
BOOTH: Okay, great.

28:56.003 --> 28:57.804
So what were you doing?
Just sawing up patients

28:57.838 --> 28:59.639
to make room for
a new popsicle?

28:59.673 --> 29:00.940
I needed
the space,

29:00.974 --> 29:02.608
but I was preserving his brain,

29:02.643 --> 29:04.243
which is really
all that matters.

29:04.278 --> 29:06.446
Because by the time we're
able to reanimate people,

29:06.480 --> 29:07.720
we'll be giving
them new bodies.

29:07.748 --> 29:08.981
Better bodies.

29:09.016 --> 29:10.316
You were harvesting his organs.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.951
To sell them.
Yes.

29:11.985 --> 29:13.186
They have done successful

29:13.220 --> 29:14.821
cryo transplants of kidneys.

29:14.855 --> 29:16.722
That's how I got the funds
to keep his brain stored.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.958
Selling body parts,
that's not in your contract.

29:18.992 --> 29:20.359
If Madeline exposed you,

29:20.394 --> 29:22.034
that could destroy your business.
Madeline

29:22.062 --> 29:24.363
was committed to the work.

29:24.398 --> 29:25.631
She understood
the necessity

29:25.666 --> 29:27.166
of keeping the
facility solvent.

29:27.201 --> 29:28.367
Look at the last grant proposal

29:28.402 --> 29:29.735
that we worked on together.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.537
It mentions organ sales.
BOOTH: Right. Okay.

29:31.572 --> 29:33.439
So, uh, cutting up people
and selling their parts,

29:33.474 --> 29:35.274
all of a sudden
that's a good thing now?

29:35.309 --> 29:36.476
BRENNAN: Well, it could save
people's lives,

29:36.510 --> 29:38.678
if the organs are
frozen properly.

29:38.712 --> 29:40.012
You're on his side now?
Agent Booth,

29:40.047 --> 29:41.647
everything
that I do,

29:41.682 --> 29:42.815
my life's work,

29:42.850 --> 29:44.951
is dedicated
to preventing death.

29:44.985 --> 29:46.953
I would never
kill anyone.

29:46.987 --> 29:50.823
Especially someone as close
to me as Madeline was.

29:56.163 --> 29:57.997
HODGINS: So it has to be
either Tripp Warshaw

29:58.031 --> 29:59.232
or the guys
from CryoNova.

29:59.266 --> 30:00.566
SAROYAN:
Seems reasonable.

30:00.601 --> 30:02.235
Well, the ex-husband's not out.

30:02.269 --> 30:04.570
He studied pre-med in college,
so he's not as dumb

30:04.605 --> 30:06.839
about this whole process
as he wants us to believe.

30:06.874 --> 30:08.114
How does someone
go from pre-med

30:08.142 --> 30:09.375
to having two strikes
against them?

30:09.409 --> 30:11.277
Drugs.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.045
Although he's been
in recovery for the past two years.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.447
Well, so he says.

30:14.481 --> 30:15.982
People are not always
who they seem to be.

30:16.016 --> 30:18.184
Are we talking
about the case now

30:18.218 --> 30:19.860
or are we talking about
dinner last night?

30:19.885 --> 30:20.620
Wow.

30:20.621 --> 30:23.022
You do not give up, do you?
You really have to ask her that?

30:23.056 --> 30:26.025
You know, I felt
bad for Arastoo.

30:26.059 --> 30:28.094
He had this notion that
when I met the folks,

30:28.128 --> 30:30.596
it was gonna be all
rainbows and unicorns.

30:30.631 --> 30:31.931
That never sounded good to me.

30:31.965 --> 30:33.445
I mean, unicorns,
they seem dangerous,

30:33.467 --> 30:34.834
with the horn and everything...

30:37.304 --> 30:38.638
Not really the
point. Sorry.

30:38.672 --> 30:40.039
Continue.

30:40.073 --> 30:41.674
So they didn't
approve of you?

30:41.708 --> 30:43.142
Arastoo wouldn't let it
get that far, I guess.

30:43.177 --> 30:44.817
That's why we left.
You would have stayed?

30:44.845 --> 30:47.079
He knows them.
I don't.

30:47.114 --> 30:48.481
I just, I feel terrible

30:48.515 --> 30:50.816
being the source of all
of this hostility.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.084
Isn't this a little sexy,
though?

30:52.119 --> 30:53.953
I mean, him
defending your love

30:53.987 --> 30:55.721
at any cost?

30:56.924 --> 30:58.090
Wait a minute.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.393
If the husband
did freeze Madeline,

31:00.427 --> 31:02.028
he could have
put her in a dewar

31:02.062 --> 31:03.362
and the Summers
might not have known.

31:03.397 --> 31:05.865
Until new clients
needed to be frozen.

31:05.899 --> 31:07.500
Yeah, they'd have
to get rid of Madeline

31:07.534 --> 31:10.937
before they were arrested
for murder.

31:10.971 --> 31:13.739
HODGINS: Those were the last four bone
fragments buried in the muck.

31:13.774 --> 31:14.369
Nothing more?

31:14.394 --> 31:16.342
Anything else probably
sunk into the swamp

31:16.343 --> 31:18.044
or was carried off by predators.

31:18.078 --> 31:19.612
I did find this, though.

31:19.646 --> 31:21.814
It's synthetic
multi-filament thread.

31:21.848 --> 31:23.216
Tied.

31:25.052 --> 31:26.419
Stitches.
The victim had to

31:26.453 --> 31:27.653
have been injured
before she was killed.

31:27.688 --> 31:28.888
There's no
record of her

31:28.922 --> 31:30.923
visiting a hospital
or a doctor.

31:30.958 --> 31:32.325
Dr. Brennan,
feel this.

31:35.028 --> 31:36.329
I see what you
mean, Mr. Vaziri.

31:36.363 --> 31:37.697
You do?

31:37.731 --> 31:39.498
The hole has curved,
smooth edges.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.968
That injury was not caused by
trauma during the body dump.

31:42.002 --> 31:44.036
That part of the skull
was removed surgically.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.705
Yes. This is
a cranial

31:45.739 --> 31:47.740
perforation with the
express purpose

31:47.774 --> 31:49.734
of placing a microphone
inside the victim's skull.

31:49.743 --> 31:52.712
Wait... what?
To listen for cracking as she froze,

31:52.746 --> 31:54.847
to protect the brain.
They're actually referred to

31:54.881 --> 31:56.482
as crackphones.

31:56.516 --> 31:57.850
This is an excellent find,

31:57.884 --> 31:59.752
Mr. Vaziri.
Wow. Focusing on your work

31:59.786 --> 32:02.288
to avoid personal issues
has its rewards.

32:02.322 --> 32:05.358
Yes, I often use work
to avoid my personal life.

32:06.793 --> 32:08.261
Implanting
a crackphone

32:08.295 --> 32:10.596
would require great skill.

32:10.631 --> 32:12.064
I doubt the ex-husband
could accomplish this,

32:12.099 --> 32:14.166
even with some
medical training.

32:14.201 --> 32:15.635
CryoNova must have audio records
from their crackphones.

32:15.669 --> 32:16.969
Well, doesn't
that mean

32:17.004 --> 32:18.638
the other cryo guy,
Tripp Warshaw,

32:18.672 --> 32:20.273
would have audio records, too?

32:23.377 --> 32:25.578
BOOTH: All of Warshaw's
equipment was repossessed

32:25.612 --> 32:27.046
and all the bodies
that were there,

32:27.080 --> 32:28.447
they were sent to another
company in New York.

32:28.482 --> 32:30.149
And the audio from
the crackphones?

32:30.183 --> 32:32.118
Ah, it was all erased when
the equipment was returned.

32:32.152 --> 32:34.220
You're missing a good, old-fashioned
murder, aren't you?

32:34.254 --> 32:35.655
Oh, come on.
Aren't you?

32:35.689 --> 32:36.956
We're all sitting
around here, hoping that

32:36.990 --> 32:38.190
someone recorded
a confession

32:38.225 --> 32:39.925
into some frozen
lady's head.

32:39.960 --> 32:43.629
And that's only if CryoNova kept
their audio files.

32:43.664 --> 32:46.499
The records at CryoNova show
that a family of four came in

32:46.533 --> 32:49.468
seven days ago for processing.
There was a car accident.

32:49.503 --> 32:51.304
So they had to make
room for them.

32:51.338 --> 32:53.873
Exactly. One of the dewars had
to be cleaned and prepped.

32:53.907 --> 32:56.309
Well, the crackphones
at CryoNova exist in a sleep mode.

32:56.343 --> 32:58.978
They only get activated
when noise is made.

32:59.012 --> 33:01.013
So the audio files
still exist.

33:01.048 --> 33:04.984
Yeah. And I don't think CryoNova's
gonna be very happy about it.

33:05.018 --> 33:08.220
I enhanced the audio.

33:08.255 --> 33:11.590
WOMAN: I knew what was going on
with you, bitch.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.726
(wheeled cart rolling)

33:13.760 --> 33:15.294
Sound's like someone's removing
the victim's body

33:15.329 --> 33:16.829
from one of the dewars.

33:16.863 --> 33:19.365
To dispose of it because
new bodies were coming in.

33:19.399 --> 33:21.167
Who is it?

33:21.201 --> 33:23.302
I think this next part
will make that pretty clear.

33:23.337 --> 33:27.673
WOMAN: Noah is mine, not yours.
It's time we finally end this.

33:27.708 --> 33:28.974
Michelle Summers.

33:29.009 --> 33:30.643
Madeline must've
been having an affair

33:30.677 --> 33:32.545
with her husband.
Yeah. I think

33:32.579 --> 33:35.114
Mrs. Frankenstein
is your killer.

33:38.864 --> 33:41.132
I knew what was going on
with you, bitch.

33:41.166 --> 33:45.025
Noah is mine, not yours.
It's time we finally end this.

33:45.026 --> 33:47.027
Hey, look, that was
time-stamped a week ago

33:47.062 --> 33:50.197
when Madeline Papadelis' body
was dumped in the swamp.

33:50.232 --> 33:51.599
That proves nothing.

33:51.633 --> 33:53.434
I believe I was talking
to another employee

33:53.468 --> 33:55.736
as I was prepping
one of the dewars.

33:55.771 --> 33:57.638
She was flirting
with my husband.

33:57.672 --> 33:59.473
If your job was prepping
the dewars,

33:59.508 --> 34:02.143
that means that you knew that
Madeline was being stored there.

34:02.177 --> 34:04.458
Our patients are stored in bags
and suspended upside down.

34:04.479 --> 34:07.314
One of those fibers from the bags
was found on her body.

34:07.349 --> 34:08.748
Your husband and
Madeline spent

34:08.784 --> 34:10.184
a lot of time together,
didn't they?

34:10.185 --> 34:11.552
We've been
through this.

34:11.585 --> 34:13.420
They wrote grant proposals
together.

34:13.455 --> 34:14.989
She was helping him raise money.

34:15.023 --> 34:17.291
You know, on our warrant,
we were able to look

34:17.324 --> 34:20.860
not only at your husband's
personal e-mails on his computer

34:20.896 --> 34:22.963
but also CryoNova's.

34:22.998 --> 34:24.465
Yeah, there are
eight e-mails here

34:24.498 --> 34:26.500
where your husband asked
Madeline if they could meet privately.

34:26.534 --> 34:28.536
My husband and I are
very much in love.

34:28.570 --> 34:30.271
Really? Because
on these two here,

34:30.304 --> 34:32.139
he asked to meet her at a motel.

34:32.174 --> 34:33.841
And they're all dated
four months ago.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.743
When Madeline disappeared,

34:35.777 --> 34:38.179
they worked together closely,
they were falling in love.

34:38.213 --> 34:39.847
You saw an
opportunity

34:39.880 --> 34:41.549
and you took it.

34:41.583 --> 34:43.284
Tell you what.
If you help us out,

34:43.318 --> 34:45.018
the prosecutor
is going to be much more

34:45.053 --> 34:46.253
understanding on you.

34:46.288 --> 34:48.255
I will not be manipulated
like this.

34:48.290 --> 34:50.391
I want a lawyer.

34:57.566 --> 34:58.999
Michelle Summers will be
released

34:59.034 --> 35:00.801
if we don't find evidence

35:00.836 --> 35:02.503
that links her directly
to the murder.

35:02.537 --> 35:04.805
She can be held
for the disposal of the remains.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.941
But our job
is to arrest a murderer.

35:06.975 --> 35:09.610
The lack of perimortem
injuries suggests the murderer

35:09.644 --> 35:10.878
was not violent.

35:10.912 --> 35:12.813
The killer took care
not to cause her pain.

35:12.848 --> 35:14.582
That doesn't sound like a jealous wife.
I agree,

35:14.616 --> 35:16.217
especially considering
she was anesthetized

35:16.251 --> 35:17.384
with chloroform first.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.485
But Michelle Summers was

35:18.520 --> 35:19.753
a professional; she'd know how

35:19.788 --> 35:21.088
to kill someone
without leaving

35:21.122 --> 35:22.322
evidence of a violent assault.

35:22.324 --> 35:23.390
That doesn't explain

35:23.425 --> 35:24.525
why she took care

35:24.559 --> 35:25.999
to cryogenically preserve
the victim.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.362
And why insert the crackphone?

35:28.396 --> 35:31.565
She wouldn't want to reanimate
a woman she hated.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.467
Look at the hole
in the temporal

35:33.501 --> 35:35.502
where the crackphone
was inserted.

35:35.537 --> 35:37.738
Feel the beveling.

35:37.772 --> 35:39.573
The angle of the incision.

35:39.608 --> 35:42.109
It had to have been made
by a left-handed person.

35:42.143 --> 35:44.245
Michelle Summers
is right-handed.

35:44.279 --> 35:46.247
I don't understand.

35:46.281 --> 35:47.882
Her husband must be left-handed.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.150
No one else would take such care
after a murder.

35:50.185 --> 35:52.052
Because, to him,
this wasn't a murder.

35:55.090 --> 35:56.690
We know it was you
who froze her.

35:56.725 --> 35:58.192
Absurd.

35:58.226 --> 35:59.693
We rewatched the video

35:59.728 --> 36:01.795
of you removing the
frozen kidney,

36:01.830 --> 36:03.631
and we noticed something.

36:03.665 --> 36:05.532
In order to vitrify
a patient,

36:05.567 --> 36:08.869
you have to perform
a median sternotomy, isn't that correct?

36:08.904 --> 36:10.571
So?
Closing that

36:10.605 --> 36:12.106
incision requires stitches.

36:12.140 --> 36:14.074
Like these.

36:14.109 --> 36:16.443
So you used a distinctive,

36:16.478 --> 36:18.846
unnecessarily
complicated style of suturing:

36:18.880 --> 36:22.449
the Interrupted Vertical
Mattress Suture.

36:22.484 --> 36:25.786
I'm not the only doctor
who does interrupted sutures.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.454
No, but being left-handed,

36:27.489 --> 36:30.090
you're the only one at CryoNova
who knots each suture

36:30.125 --> 36:32.693
on the left side as
opposed to the right

36:32.727 --> 36:36.830
as well as using a surgical knot
instead of a simple reef.

36:36.865 --> 36:38.933
Quite distinctive.
Like I said, you killed her.

36:38.967 --> 36:40.801
She wasn't dead.

36:40.835 --> 36:42.236
I would never kill her.

36:42.270 --> 36:44.204
Right, you just wanted
to keep her really cold.

36:44.239 --> 36:46.807
Your wife found out when
those new clients came in.

36:46.841 --> 36:50.744
She dumped her in that swamp.
Michelle killed her.

36:50.779 --> 36:53.714
I loved Maddie.

36:53.748 --> 36:55.416
She understood my work,

36:55.450 --> 36:58.218
we spent every day together
writing grants.

36:58.253 --> 37:01.288
But she didn't love you,
did she?

37:04.259 --> 37:06.994
I-I could have revived her.

37:07.028 --> 37:08.662
And her daughter.

37:08.697 --> 37:11.532
Maybe it would have taken
ten years or so,

37:11.566 --> 37:13.200
but...

37:15.403 --> 37:17.438
when she came back,

37:17.472 --> 37:19.540
she would've grown to love me.

37:26.748 --> 37:28.782
She just needed time.

37:32.988 --> 37:37.891
♪ I'm sitting on a gold mine

37:40.128 --> 37:43.864
♪ And all I gotta do is dig

37:47.669 --> 37:50.938
♪ But I'm waiting on

37:50.972 --> 37:56.076
♪ A landslide.

37:58.246 --> 38:00.014
(doorbell rings)

38:02.984 --> 38:05.019
Ooh.

38:08.156 --> 38:10.324
Azita, Armin.

38:10.358 --> 38:11.925
We were going to call you,

38:11.960 --> 38:14.294
but didn't know whether
you'd hang up or not.

38:14.329 --> 38:15.863
Oh, of-of course not.

38:15.897 --> 38:17.931
Uh, come in.
I'm actually,

38:17.966 --> 38:19.500
I'm just making
some tea.

38:19.534 --> 38:21.602
Ah, thank you.

38:21.636 --> 38:22.736
Who was at the...?

38:22.771 --> 38:24.238
Oh.

38:24.272 --> 38:26.407
Are you going to have a fit
and walk out again

38:26.441 --> 38:27.674
because I'm
staying for tea?

38:27.709 --> 38:30.811
We know how you feel.
Did you forget an insult or two?

38:30.845 --> 38:32.179
Why don't we all sit?

38:32.213 --> 38:34.014
You don't know how
we feel, Arastoo,

38:34.049 --> 38:36.417
'cause you never stop
judging us to notice.

38:36.451 --> 38:38.385
You've always been
a hothead.

38:38.420 --> 38:41.321
Ah, here we go.
Yes, here we go.

38:41.356 --> 38:46.093
Growing up, you were always
making the wrong decisions,

38:46.127 --> 38:47.728
getting into trouble.

38:50.331 --> 38:54.802
But you've grown into
such a wonderful man...

38:56.004 --> 39:00.474
so successful,
so fine.

39:07.382 --> 39:08.816
Whatever made you think

39:08.850 --> 39:11.585
we didn't notice
you'd grown up?

39:13.988 --> 39:16.623
You're making Cam cry, Azita.
Apologize.

39:16.658 --> 39:18.926
It's okay.

39:21.663 --> 39:24.131
But the other night,
with all the questions...

39:24.165 --> 39:25.332
Questions?

39:25.366 --> 39:27.201
Interest.

39:29.504 --> 39:32.806
Clearly, you're with
a wonderful woman,

39:32.841 --> 39:35.843
so brave to raise a child
on her own,

39:35.877 --> 39:37.444
so accomplished.

39:39.547 --> 39:42.549
You have good judgment, Arastoo.

39:46.921 --> 39:48.689
And excellent taste.

39:52.193 --> 39:54.628
You're not a teenager anymore.

39:54.662 --> 39:58.132
Let us be proud of you.
Let us be happy for you.

40:10.845 --> 40:12.212
I'm sorry.

40:13.281 --> 40:15.015
You should be.

40:17.552 --> 40:20.154
You look very comfortable
in those clothes.

40:20.188 --> 40:23.524
I imagine you spend
a lot of time here.

40:23.558 --> 40:24.925
Azita, it's none
of our business.

40:24.959 --> 40:27.227
And she's wearing
Arastoo's shirt.

40:27.262 --> 40:29.663
I cannot accept everything, Armin.
Can we at least have

40:29.697 --> 40:31.865
our tea before you start talking
about marriage?

40:31.900 --> 40:33.167
Marriage?

40:33.201 --> 40:37.437
Usually when a man introduces
a woman to his parents...

40:37.472 --> 40:39.039
You didn't think
that was an important fact?

40:39.073 --> 40:40.774
That's not how I feel.

40:40.808 --> 40:44.945
Someplace inside, you knew.

40:49.684 --> 40:51.552
Why don't you
grab the tea?

40:51.586 --> 40:53.253
I'm-I'm gonna go
grab a Scotch.

40:53.288 --> 40:54.321
Good idea.

40:54.355 --> 40:55.889
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:02.830 --> 41:06.600
BRENNAN: Sweets said that now the deputy
director is reviewing you

41:06.634 --> 41:07.834
for the promotion.

41:07.869 --> 41:10.404
Yeah, that's what
he told me, too.

41:10.438 --> 41:12.773
Why wouldn't you
mention that?

41:12.807 --> 41:15.609
Because nothing's definite yet,
Bones, that's why.

41:15.643 --> 41:18.212
Booth, you don't have
to worry about me. We can do this.

41:18.246 --> 41:20.375
There are many places

41:20.376 --> 41:21.275
I could work over there.

41:21.276 --> 41:23.498
In two years, 
Christine could be bilingual.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.451
Wait a second.

41:24.452 --> 41:27.888
Now you're just, you're getting
way ahead of yourself here.

41:27.922 --> 41:32.459
You always tell me
that I'm too rational,

41:32.493 --> 41:35.796
that dreaming is good.

41:36.965 --> 41:39.900
I'm not sure
this is such a good dream.

41:42.537 --> 41:44.538
I mean, from the military angle,

41:44.572 --> 41:46.206
them having me review
all these shootings

41:46.241 --> 41:49.443
and they've been looking
at my skill sets...

41:49.477 --> 41:51.878
Your gut is telling you
something, isn't it?

41:51.913 --> 41:53.113
Yeah.

41:53.147 --> 41:55.349
The base over there...

41:55.383 --> 41:58.318
it's a staging ground
for counterterrorism activity

41:58.353 --> 41:59.753
and covert operations.

42:01.489 --> 42:04.157
You think they might be asking
you to be a sniper again?

42:04.192 --> 42:05.759
I won't do it.

42:05.793 --> 42:07.728
I have a new life.
I have a family.

42:07.762 --> 42:09.596
They can't make me
do that again.

42:09.631 --> 42:12.799
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to, Booth.

42:19.448 --> 42:21.249
Right.
