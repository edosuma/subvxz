WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.352
All my life, I felt like I was
just going through the motions.

00:04.395 --> 00:06.223
Walking left, walking right.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.487
As if I were a background
character in my own life.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.185
And then I saw her.

00:11.228 --> 00:14.231
We locked eyes.
And that was it.

00:14.275 --> 00:18.409
I loved her instantly.
We've been together ever since.

00:18.453 --> 00:21.412
They don't usually
let us talk.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.197
I shot my first husband!

00:58.884 --> 01:00.886
Wow!

01:00.930 --> 01:02.540
"Wow" is right!

01:02.584 --> 01:04.325
We couldn't sleep either!

01:04.368 --> 01:07.371
Tomorrow is the big day!
It's all come down to this!

01:07.415 --> 01:09.112
The overnight class trip!

01:09.156 --> 01:13.551
To the most romantic city
in the world-- Philadelphia.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.771
Two nights. No parents.

01:15.814 --> 01:19.209
You're going to literally fall
in love in the City of Love!

01:19.253 --> 01:21.124
Well, it's the
City of Brotherly Love.

01:21.168 --> 01:24.127
And, brother,
you're gonna fall in love!

01:27.087 --> 01:29.654
Steve, tell us again
about Milk Girl.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.179
- Again?!
- Give us the goss, boss!

01:32.222 --> 01:34.790
Well, as you all know,
she's a tenth grader.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.053
Oooo!

01:37.097 --> 01:40.578
She sits in the front row
of my AP Philadelphia class,

01:40.622 --> 01:43.015
puts her backpack
on the left side of her chair,

01:43.059 --> 01:44.234
and she drinks

01:44.278 --> 01:46.541
- a [bleep] ton of milk.
- No cap.

01:46.584 --> 01:49.196
I've been in love with her
from afar all year,

01:49.239 --> 01:52.068
and this is the trip
where I turn afar...

01:52.112 --> 01:55.202
into... a-close.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.947
- Is that her?
- No.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.080
- Is that her?!
- Guys, I promise,

02:04.124 --> 02:05.734
when you see her,
you will know.

02:05.777 --> 02:06.865
Eee!

02:06.909 --> 02:09.825
Francine, please,
try to be cool.

02:11.522 --> 02:15.396
Guess who just transferred
into AP Philadelphia!

02:15.439 --> 02:17.528
I heard you guys were
going to the US Mint,

02:17.572 --> 02:19.704
and I've always
been super curious

02:19.748 --> 02:21.271
about what money
looks like!

02:21.315 --> 02:24.361
I figured we could sit together
on the bus

02:24.405 --> 02:27.451
and you can catch me up
on other Philadelphia stuff,

02:27.495 --> 02:30.062
like how a cream cheese
became a city.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.325
- He can't!
- He can't!

02:31.368 --> 02:33.196
Would that I could, pal.
See this cooler?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.763
Full of milk.

02:34.806 --> 02:37.505
I'm talking skim, whole,
almond, unpasteurized,

02:37.548 --> 02:40.377
milk of magnesia, should
the unpasteurized be a problem.

02:40.421 --> 02:43.380
So the plan is, I sit
next to her on the bus,

02:43.424 --> 02:47.428
dazzle her with the milk buffet,
just lay a solid foundation.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.995
By the time we get to the
Rocky Statue part of the trip,

02:50.039 --> 02:52.215
we'll be practically engaged.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.783
O-M-G, O-M-G, O-M-G!
That's gotta be her!

02:54.826 --> 02:56.567
She's here!
O-M-G! Don't look!

02:56.611 --> 02:58.395
She's perfect
just like you said

02:58.439 --> 03:01.442
There is just something
so sweet about her.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.444
And even though
I don't know her name yet,

03:03.487 --> 03:05.446
I know we are destined
to be together.

03:05.489 --> 03:08.057
Listen up!
I only teach this class

03:08.100 --> 03:10.973
for the free trip
to Filthydelphia.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.716
I look forward to it
all year.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.935
I'm counting on you kids
to be cool.

03:18.415 --> 03:19.982
Woo! That's strong!

03:20.025 --> 03:21.853
This is my boy Marty.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.073
Normally, I'd have some teachers
or parents chaperone,

03:24.116 --> 03:27.119
but lucky for you,
Marty is in town

03:27.163 --> 03:29.470
and he's looking
to get out of town.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.647
And now attendance.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.737
I-- I see, uh, Milk Girl.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.305
There's, uh, Milk Girl's
Little Friend.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.263
And, uh, yeah.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.614
Y-Y-Y-You know what? It--
It looks like you're all here.

03:43.658 --> 03:46.138
If you're here,
just get on the bus!

03:50.491 --> 03:53.624
'Scuse me! 'Scuse.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.365
Sorry! Coming through!

03:57.367 --> 03:59.630
Um, what do you think you're
doing? I'm sitting here.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.762
AHHH!

04:00.805 --> 04:03.025
Unh! Aaah!

04:03.068 --> 04:04.853
Don't freak out.
It's vintage.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.334
This fox has been dead
for like 70 years.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.074
I wear it to remind me
of my grandma.

04:09.118 --> 04:12.295
She was a stone-cold fox.
Still is actually.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.297
And what a bitch.
I really admire her.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.951
I can't believe it!

04:15.994 --> 04:17.213
That my grandma
is my best friend?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.823
What? No.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.173
I was supposed to be sitting
next to a girl up there.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.175
I had the perfect plan.

04:23.219 --> 04:26.222
We were gonna fall in love
on this bus.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.050
Well, your "perfect plan"
had a fatal flaw--

04:28.093 --> 04:29.530
love doesn't exist.

04:29.573 --> 04:30.792
Anyway, hi. I'm Ali.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.446
Well, I'm Steve.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.622
And that's insane.
Of course love exists.

04:34.665 --> 04:35.666
No, it doesn't.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.886
It does,
and it conquers all.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.410
Me and that girl up there
are soul mates.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.585
Which girl?

04:41.629 --> 04:42.847
The girl drinking milk.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.284
What's her name?

04:44.327 --> 04:47.199
"What's in a name?"
Shakespeare.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.505
So you don't even know
her name.

04:48.549 --> 04:50.681
You're distracting me.
I have to do something!

04:50.725 --> 04:52.988
- Something embarrassing?
- I'm writing a note

04:53.031 --> 04:55.251
asking her out on a date
once we get to Philly.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.993
Smart move--
weird and embarrassing.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.125
Pass this up
to Milk Girl.

05:00.169 --> 05:01.823
I can't believe
I get to watch this.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.041
Believe it, honey.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.869
That's a ghost pepper.

05:04.913 --> 05:08.438
AAAAHHHH!

05:08.482 --> 05:11.354
Help!
Somebody help me!

05:18.274 --> 05:20.798
Hi, Steve!
How's it going back there?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.713
I need a drink!
Please! AAAHHH!

05:22.757 --> 05:24.672
Heh! Nice try, kid!

05:24.715 --> 05:26.500
You're an amazing chaperone.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.374
Ugh! Ahh...

05:31.418 --> 05:34.029
Hunh!

05:41.123 --> 05:42.603
Well, my life is over.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.387
So, she got your note.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.520
She says... yes.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.784

05:50.393 --> 05:52.787
We've never actually met
Milk Girl,

05:52.830 --> 05:55.703
but we've adjusted our wills
to include her.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.793
Oh, we were hoping you
could tell us how you two met.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.404
Us? He picked me up
on the side of the road.

06:01.448 --> 06:04.015
Anyway,

of the Holiday Inn

06:50.105 --> 06:53.935
Got milk? Heh.
Why, yes, I have.

06:53.978 --> 06:57.765
So, I've been watching you,
not in a creepy way,

06:57.808 --> 07:02.465
and I know I don't "know" you,
but I feel like I do,

07:02.509 --> 07:05.599
and I hope you won't mind
me saying so, but...

07:05.642 --> 07:07.035
I love you.

07:07.078 --> 07:10.212
Oh, my God, Steve.
Of course you do.

07:10.255 --> 07:13.258
And you do know me.
And you do love me.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.869
Because...

07:14.912 --> 07:16.697
I'm Reese Witherspoon.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.002
What?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.656
This is so great!

07:19.700 --> 07:21.310
- It is?
- Yes!

07:21.353 --> 07:23.704
I had to go undercover
as a high-school student

07:23.747 --> 07:26.794
to prove to the studio I could
still play a 17-year-old.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.839
They said if a boy
asks me on a date

07:28.883 --> 07:32.016
and says he's in love with me,
they would make the movie!

07:32.060 --> 07:34.192
So thank you, Steve.

07:34.236 --> 07:37.282
You single-handedly greenlit <i>
ELECTION 2: Omaha Drift.</i>

07:37.326 --> 07:39.284
Wait.
Do you even like milk?

07:39.328 --> 07:40.895
I hate milk.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.679
I'm just
a really good actress.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.074
Oh, my God!

07:48.250 --> 07:52.080
I also do my own stuuunts!

07:52.863 --> 07:54.778
How did I meet babe?

07:54.822 --> 07:57.738
Well, actually
it's a great story.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.958
How did we meet, babe?

08:01.002 --> 08:03.526
You don't remember
how we met?!

08:03.570 --> 08:05.397
Okay.
Here's how we met.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.924
Did we meet
at a Braves Game?

08:11.752 --> 08:13.362
Who are these people?

08:16.583 --> 08:19.629
And then Reese Witherspoon
just jumped off the roof.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.110
This is crazy!

08:22.153 --> 08:24.068
Have you seen these?!

08:24.112 --> 08:25.766
What even are these?

08:25.809 --> 08:28.290
You grab one,
you get like 30.

08:28.333 --> 08:31.075
Philadelphia
is full of wonders.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.863
Oh, my God. My parents
keep calling me.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.255
What am I gonna
tell them?

08:37.299 --> 08:39.170
I went to Philly
and didn't fall in love?

08:40.215 --> 08:43.566
I think that girl in the fur
coat threw something at you.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.789
Hey! You!
What are you throwing?!

08:48.832 --> 08:51.052
- Eggs.
- There's eggs?!

08:51.095 --> 08:54.359
Okay.
This I gotta see.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.536
Sorry.
I was just, like,

08:56.579 --> 08:58.407
trying to hit you in the face
with all those eggs.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.974
That's not an apology.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.279
Everyone shut up!

09:01.323 --> 09:04.239
Marty is missing!
So is the bus.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.633
Here is a napkin with some
places I think we were at.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.374
Pass it around, take a photo,
commit it to memory,

09:09.418 --> 09:11.202
w-whatever you have to do.

09:11.246 --> 09:14.423
Here's the plan-- buddy system.
That's all I got.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.033
Whoever you are
standing next to

09:16.077 --> 09:17.208
is your partner
for the rest of the trip.

09:19.036 --> 09:22.083
Do not separate.
Do not lose each other.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.520
I'm still rolling my face off.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.130
It goes without saying
that everything

09:26.174 --> 09:27.915
we were supposed to do
is cancelled.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.091
I don't want to hear that you
guys were at the Liberty Bell

09:30.134 --> 09:32.310
or Betsy Ross' house
or some shit.

09:32.354 --> 09:35.444
You have one objective--
find my friend!

09:35.487 --> 09:37.620
Whoever finds Marty gets an "A,"

09:37.664 --> 09:40.318
and whoever doesn't find him
gets an "F"!

09:40.362 --> 09:42.669
Move, move, move, move, move!

09:45.715 --> 09:47.848
I don't even know
where Reese Witherspoon

09:47.891 --> 09:49.501
was hiding the parachute.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.635
So you're, like,
dramatic, huh?

09:52.679 --> 09:55.333
- That's your thing?
- That's your takeaway?

09:55.377 --> 09:57.161
Don't you think
my story's insane?!

09:57.205 --> 09:58.989
I once saw Gwyneth Paltrow
sunbathing naked

09:59.033 --> 10:00.861
on top of a moving car.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.732
Actresses are cool.

10:02.776 --> 10:04.168
Can I tell you
what your problem is?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.822
That'd be perfect.
Why don't you?

10:05.866 --> 10:08.303
You have high expectations
and you think things matter.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.174
But nothing matters.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.960
"Nothing matters."
Will you listen to yourself?

10:13.003 --> 10:16.137
If we don't find Lewis' friend,
we'll get F's in the class.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.878
That doesn't matter
to you?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.444
Now you're getting it.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.143
- Oh, no! Gum!

10:22.186 --> 10:25.146
There's gum on me!
Who would do this?!

10:25.189 --> 10:29.237
This is what I mean
when I say you're dramatic.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.847
I really thought
I was in love,

10:30.891 --> 10:33.154
but she was never even
an option.

10:33.197 --> 10:35.983
Are you right?
Is love not real?

10:36.026 --> 10:39.073
It's good you found out now.
Some people never learn.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.031
Oh, man.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.990
How are we gonna
find Marty?

10:43.033 --> 10:45.732
I'm a heartbroken child
in a strange land!

10:45.775 --> 10:47.951
Calm down,
Dame Judi Dench.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.737
My family moved to Langley
last year, but I'm from Philly.

10:50.780 --> 10:54.566
This is my town.
Hand me that napkin.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.439
Oh, cool. My dad's favorite
strip club is on here.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.227
- Hi. Hello.
- Yao. What can I get you?

11:03.271 --> 11:05.665
Um, I'm hoping
you could help me.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.710
Ye, ye, aright.
Wit or wit-out?

11:07.754 --> 11:11.061
I, uh-- I'm sorry.
I don't speak the language.

11:11.105 --> 11:15.718
I'm looking for a large
drunk gentleman!

11:15.762 --> 11:18.199
Okay. Ye need to get yaself
sorted and stop yellin' at me.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.592
I'm so sorry.
It's just that...

11:20.636 --> 11:24.988
I don't have a chaperone
or a partner or a bus.

11:25.032 --> 11:27.730
And I don't know anything!

11:27.774 --> 11:30.298
And I'm all alone!

11:30.341 --> 11:32.692
Oh, oh. Don't cry, dude.
I'll help ya.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.955
Lou! I'm taking the rest
of the day off!

11:34.998 --> 11:38.436
Anne Marie, I swear to Christ if
you do this again you're fired!

11:38.480 --> 11:39.699
What did you say ta me?

11:40.961 --> 11:42.440
<i>♪ Ahh♪</i>

11:44.355 --> 11:47.054
<i>♪ Now I don't hardly know her♪</i>

11:51.014 --> 11:54.583
<i>♪ But I think I could love her♪</i>

11:56.585 --> 11:59.849
He's used the same needle
for the last five people.

11:59.893 --> 12:02.069
It's fine.
We're sisters.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.766
So, the guy
you're lookin' for

12:03.810 --> 12:05.942
got his belly button pierced
around 2:00 a.m.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.944
And then he drank a bunch of ink
and ran out.

12:07.988 --> 12:09.380
Cool.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.080
Does your chest tattoo say
"[Bleep] Dallas"?

12:13.123 --> 12:15.909
Yeah. Cowboys
can suck my

12:18.433 --> 12:19.956
So, when are we gonna

12:20.000 --> 12:22.219
start looking for
my principal's friend?

12:22.263 --> 12:24.091
Yo, snot, whaddaya think
happens when you die?

12:24.134 --> 12:26.658
- I don't know.
- Well, I do.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.660
My uncle Jimmy fell off
the 700 level

12:28.704 --> 12:30.880
at the old Veterans Stadium
trying to reach a foul ball.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.534
He was legally dead
for four minutes.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.102
You know he got
that ball, though.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.669
Anyways, he says
what happens when you die

12:37.713 --> 12:39.628
is you sit in a room
waiting for God

12:39.671 --> 12:42.196
to tell you if you were
a big enough Phillies fan.

12:42.239 --> 12:45.460
Ohh.
I didn't know that.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.244
I feel like I could tell you
anything, Snotter.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.116
I'm really glad
you're my boyfriend.

12:49.159 --> 12:51.248
- I am?!
- Uh, you bet your tits you are.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.473
We've been almost everywhere
on the list

12:58.516 --> 13:00.127
and have no useful information.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.563
Here's what we do know--

13:01.606 --> 13:03.304
you're obsessed
with the little napkin.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.219
I am not obsessed
with the napkin.

13:05.262 --> 13:08.831
You're in a strip club, and you
haven't taken your eyes off it.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.616
These women are off-duty.
They deserve their privacy.

13:11.660 --> 13:12.835
So, they were here
around midnight,

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
but got kicked out
pretty fast.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.925
I guess they kept trying
to pay for drinks

13:15.969 --> 13:17.840
with a fake credit card?

13:17.884 --> 13:21.191
It wasn't even a credit card.
It was a sticker of a cat.

13:21.235 --> 13:23.411
They wanted
to donate plasma?

13:23.454 --> 13:25.805
No, they came in
looking to get plasma.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.372
They were very clear about
not wanting to donate any.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.461
They did, however,
want to donate sperm.

13:30.505 --> 13:32.550
Not something we do here,
but before I could answer,

13:32.594 --> 13:35.075
one of them had relations
with our mail chute.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.688
This is so stupid!
We're never gonna find this guy!

13:39.731 --> 13:41.646
Aah!

13:41.690 --> 13:45.259
Aah! Unh! I give up.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.001
I know a great place
to eat close by.

13:48.044 --> 13:51.352
It's not on the napkin, though,
so you probably don't wanna go.

13:51.395 --> 13:54.355
Screw the napkin.
Nothing matters.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.400
Hey, can you give me a ride
to New York City?

13:56.444 --> 13:58.011
Or Washington, D.C.?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.709
Or maybe we could go skiing
in the Poconos!

14:00.752 --> 14:04.582
Philadelphia-- three hours away
from a lot of great stuff.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.673
This place is the best.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.501
I used to come here
all the time with my friend.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.895
It's probably the spiciest
restaurant in Philly.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.331
Can you handle it?

14:14.375 --> 14:16.333
I'm a new man.
Bring it on.

14:16.377 --> 14:19.032
Speaking of spicy,
check them out.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.252
Oh, my God.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.214
Whoa. Hey, Ali.
What are you doing in town, bud?

14:27.257 --> 14:29.869
Umm... we...uh...

14:29.912 --> 14:31.261
We're on a field trip.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.437
Oh, man.
That sounds lame.

14:33.481 --> 14:35.787
What up? I'm Darix,
and this is Royce.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.615
I'm his girlfriend!

14:37.659 --> 14:39.791
We just said "I love you"
for the first time!

14:41.315 --> 14:44.927
See, Ali? Love is real.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.756
We're celebrating at
our fave spicy restaurant.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.932
We love spicy stuff.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.239
Well, have a good...
field trip.

14:53.718 --> 14:56.286
They seem fun.
How do you know Darix?

14:56.330 --> 14:59.072
He's... my ex-boyfriend.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.378
Well, not "boyfriend"
because he--

15:01.422 --> 15:05.774
We don't believe
in labels. Or love.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.080
Do you want to leave?

15:07.123 --> 15:08.820
We can't just leave.

15:08.864 --> 15:12.259
It will look like I'm upset.
And I'm not.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.957
I'm actually
really happy for him.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.396
Steve, don't!
That's a Carolina Reaper!

15:21.007 --> 15:23.923
AAAAAAHHH!

15:23.966 --> 15:26.403
Ow! Ow!

15:26.447 --> 15:28.492
I'll have
what he's heaving.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.497
Hey. I know you ate
that pepper for me.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.717
You think
I liquefied my insides

15:35.760 --> 15:37.501
just to get you
out of that restaurant?

15:37.545 --> 15:38.894
No way.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.461
That hospital
was on the napkin,

15:40.504 --> 15:42.463
and I'm obsessed
with the napkin, so...

15:42.506 --> 15:44.204
I'm sorry you had to
throw up and have diarrhea

15:44.247 --> 15:45.945
all over the place.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.686
I prefer to think of it as
throwing up and throwing down.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.733
Take my coat.
You must be freezing.

15:51.776 --> 15:54.301
No way. I love this dress.
It's nice on me.

15:54.344 --> 15:57.130
Don't be an idiot.
Take it.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.672
My queen, why are we
hot-wiring a cop car?

16:17.715 --> 16:19.500
Because we ain't got the keys,
ya dope!

16:24.200 --> 16:27.682
I saw this raisin in 2007
in the lobby

16:27.725 --> 16:29.901
of the Ambassador Hotel
in Chicago.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.816
It was just sitting there
on the floor.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.907
And I thought it was a bug.
But, no, it was a raisin!

16:35.951 --> 16:38.040
And now it's my raisin.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.697
Guys, I'm sorry
I didn't call back sooner.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.873
It's been a really wild
24 hours.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.007
Why are we still talking
to you?! Put Milk Girl on!

16:48.050 --> 16:50.792
Actually I have some bad news
about Milk Girl.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.054
You're scaring us, Steve!

16:52.098 --> 16:54.274
She's gone.
She was--

16:54.317 --> 16:56.145
What the hell
do you mean "gone"?!

16:56.189 --> 16:58.017
How could you let this
happen, Steven?!

16:58.060 --> 16:58.843
- She was--
- We were gonna

16:58.887 --> 17:00.802
invite her to Christmas!

17:00.845 --> 17:02.804
We made a jacket for her
that says

17:02.847 --> 17:05.763
"Milk Girl
is in Our Family Now"!

17:05.807 --> 17:08.288
Sorry? I-I didn't ask you
to do that.

17:08.331 --> 17:12.727
Dad drained our pool
and filled it with milk!

17:12.770 --> 17:16.209
What are we supposed to do with
a pool full of milk, Steve?!

17:16.252 --> 17:18.820
- Umm, guys, I got really high

17:18.863 --> 17:22.302
and I accidentally ordered
a truck full of cereal,

17:22.345 --> 17:25.305
and it just got here,
and I don't know what to do.

17:25.348 --> 17:29.048
I tried to eat it,
but it's just so dry!

17:29.091 --> 17:33.313
Steve, it looks like everything
just might work out after all!

17:33.356 --> 17:34.575
Get the giant spoon,
honey!

17:34.618 --> 17:36.490
I'm workin' on it.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.843
- I couldn't sleep.
- I couldn't either.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.063
I just can't stop thinking
about that kiss.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.630
Me neither!
It was absolutely--

17:46.674 --> 17:48.458
A mistake, right?
I mean, that's not us.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.634
That's not who we are. It
obviously didn't mean anything.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.549
So I think we should
just forget it.

17:52.593 --> 17:54.899
Plus, it was unprofessional.
You agree.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.294
- Everyone wake up!

17:58.338 --> 18:01.123
Where is Marty?!
What the hell, guys?!

18:01.167 --> 18:04.126
If you don't find him by
9:00 a.m., you're all expelled!

18:04.170 --> 18:06.128
And I'll also kill you.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.738
I'll start killing one of you

18:07.782 --> 18:10.263
every five minutes
until he is found.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.658
Starting... now.

18:14.702 --> 18:17.661
I was just sneakin'
to my cousin's room!

18:19.924 --> 18:22.013
- I freakin' love you!

18:22.057 --> 18:24.668
I freakin'
love you, too!

18:28.281 --> 18:29.673
I guess you've never heard
of Tasty Cakes,

18:29.717 --> 18:31.762
or you would have thought
that was really funny.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.723
Steve, it seems like you're
trying to be really quiet.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.246
I'm not trying.
I'm just...

18:58.920 --> 19:00.139
That's great, man.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.967
Don't worry, buddy.
We're calling for backup!

19:03.011 --> 19:06.188
Dispatch, we got a kid
smooshed between two vehicles.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.321
He looks more jacked up
than the Phillie Phanatic tattoo

19:08.364 --> 19:10.192
my cousin Donovan gave me
under the bleachers

19:10.236 --> 19:11.802
at the Mummers Parade. Over.

19:11.846 --> 19:14.457
- Steve! Are you okay?!
- Not really.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.286
I knew it! You were being
really quiet before.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.115
Well, now I'm hurt more
than before, like, physically,

19:20.159 --> 19:23.031
but I was hurt
emotionally first.

19:23.074 --> 19:25.860
When someone tells me
a kiss we had was a mistake,

19:25.903 --> 19:28.210
it-- it bums me out.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.778
You're one of the kids
I met a couple days ago!

19:30.821 --> 19:33.172
And I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not being dramatic,

19:33.215 --> 19:34.999
I'm just being real.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.479
You say you don't have
any feelings at all

19:36.523 --> 19:39.134
and that nothing matters,
but it's an act!

19:39.178 --> 19:41.919
You're the Dame Judi Dench,
not me.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.792
I like you. I know that's not
a cool thing to say,

19:44.835 --> 19:46.446
but I'm not a cool guy.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.839
And if you don't like me back,
I can take it.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.885
But you have to tell me
how you feel.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.975
Steve, let's talk
about this later.

19:54.018 --> 19:56.282
No! Nobody touch me!

19:56.325 --> 19:57.500
I'm not going
to the hospital

19:57.544 --> 20:00.503
until you tell me
how you feel about me.

20:00.547 --> 20:01.765
Fine. I like you.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.900
Marty! He's back!
Ha ha ha!

20:05.943 --> 20:08.119
You thought he was dead!

20:08.163 --> 20:10.948
Crying in your room
all night. Ha ha!

20:10.992 --> 20:13.734
I think everyone learned
a valuable lesson--

20:13.777 --> 20:17.041
Marty always
comes through!

20:17.085 --> 20:19.783
When we first met,
we hated each other.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.742
I didn't hate you.
I just thought you were a dork.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.918
And then Milk Girl
was Reese Witherspoon,

20:23.961 --> 20:25.180
and we became friends.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.703
And we're still
just friends.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.662
I know you like me.
You said it.

20:28.705 --> 20:30.446
- I'm not sure I ever said that.
- She said it.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.318
You were smooshed
between a bus and a car.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.754
I was, I was.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.756
You were refusing
medical attention.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.758
Yes, yes, that too.

20:37.801 --> 20:41.196
Anyway, she's a tenth grader,
and I'm still in ninth grade,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.851
so I'm not allowed to make
eye contact with her in school,

20:43.894 --> 20:47.550
but in a couple of years,
we'll both be upperclassmen,

20:47.594 --> 20:50.292
so we'll see
how it plays out.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.120
Yeah.
I guess we'll see.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.687

20:56.559 --> 20:58.082
Bye-bye! See you soon!
