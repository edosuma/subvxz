That must be Angel.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.531
XANDER: That weird guy
that warned her about
all the vampires?

00:09.573 --> 00:11.489
The brethren from his order
would come to the master

00:11.532 --> 00:13.621
to bring him the anointed.Who's that?

00:13.664 --> 00:15.971
The anointed
will be my greatest weapon

00:16.015 --> 00:16.972

Welcome, my friend.

there is a chosen one.

against the vampires,

from the hunt last night.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.439
Zackery was strong,
and he was careful,

00:48.482 --> 00:51.311
and still the slayer takes him,

00:51.354 --> 00:55.576

so many of my family.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.644
Not exactly a guy.

02:03.688 --> 02:05.647
For us to have
a conversation about a guy,

02:05.689 --> 02:08.300
there'd have to be a guy for us
to have a conversation about.

02:08.344 --> 02:09.562

12:41.456 --> 12:42.979
What?
Ah-uh-uh.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.980
Don't worry about Angel.
Willow can run to your house

12:45.024 --> 12:46.808
and tell him to get
out of town fast.

12:46.852 --> 12:49.245
Angel and Buffy are not
in any immediate jeopardy.

12:49.289 --> 12:51.248
Eventually the master
will send someone else,

12:51.292 --> 12:53.206
but in the meantime,
The Three, having failed,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.730
will offer their own lives
in penance.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.168
We failed in our duty,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.779
and now our lives
belong to you.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.001
Pay attention, child.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.831
You are the anointed, and there
is much you must learn.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.876
With power

13:10.919 --> 13:12.660
comes responsibility.

13:12.703 --> 13:15.184
True, they did fail,

13:15.229 --> 13:19.711
but also true, we who walk
at night share a common bond.

13:19.754 --> 13:21.975
The taking of a life--

13:22.018 --> 13:25.369
I'm not talking
about humans, of course--

13:25.413 --> 13:26.980
is a serious matter.

13:27.023 --> 13:29.198
COLLIN: So you
would spare them?

13:29.243 --> 13:31.027
[chuckles]

13:31.071 --> 13:33.202
I am weary,

13:33.246 --> 13:36.250
and their deaths
will bring me little joy.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.385
[screaming]

13:42.429 --> 13:45.432
Of course, sometimes
a little is enough.

13:45.475 --> 13:47.347
[screaming continues]

13:47.390 --> 13:49.176
[indistinct conversations]

13:51.177 --> 13:52.004
BUFFY: Cool.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.181
Crossbow.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.270
Huh. Check out these babies.

13:57.313 --> 13:58.837
Hmm.

13:58.880 --> 14:01.797
Good-bye, stakes,
hello, flying fatality.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.277
What can I shoot?

14:03.320 --> 14:06.758
Um, nothing.
The crossbow comes later.

14:06.802 --> 14:10.674
You must first become proficient
with the basic tools of combat.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.331
Let's begin
with the quarter staff,

14:15.375 --> 14:16.812
which, incidentally,

14:16.855 --> 14:19.946
will require countless hours
of vigorous training.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.860
I speak from experience.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.297
Giles, 20th century.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.734
I'm not going to be
fighting Friar Tuck.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.823
You never know with whom or what
you will be fighting.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.390
And these traditions have been
handed down through the ages.

14:30.433 --> 14:32.871
Now you show me good,
steady progress

14:32.914 --> 14:34.437
with the quarter staff,

14:34.481 --> 14:35.831
and in due course
we'll discuss the crossbow.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.398
Put on your pads.

14:38.006 --> 14:39.616
[chuckles]

14:39.661 --> 14:41.793
I'm not going to need pads
to fight you.

14:41.836 --> 14:42.924
We'll see about that.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.144
En garde.

14:46.841 --> 14:47.929
[thumping]

14:49.365 --> 14:50.453
Ha!

14:55.284 --> 14:56.460
[grunting]

15:02.466 --> 15:05.469
Good. Let's move
on to the crossbow.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.216
Angel?

15:14.260 --> 15:15.697
Hey.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.833
Brought you some dinner.

15:22.878 --> 15:25.184
It's a little plateless.
Sorry.

15:29.188 --> 15:31.668
So, what did you do
all day?

15:31.712 --> 15:33.671
I read a little...

15:33.715 --> 15:35.282
and just thought

15:35.325 --> 15:37.240
about a lot of things.
Buffy, I...

15:37.283 --> 15:38.371
My diary?

15:38.414 --> 15:39.634
You read my diary?

15:39.677 --> 15:41.765
That is not okay.

15:41.809 --> 15:43.551
A diary is, like,
a person's most private place.

15:43.594 --> 15:46.032
I, you don't even know
what I was writing about.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.250
"Hunk" can mean a lot
of things, bad things,

15:48.294 --> 15:50.557
and-and when it said
your eyes are penetrating,

15:50.600 --> 15:51.732
I meant to write "bulging."

15:51.775 --> 15:52.995
Buffy...

15:53.038 --> 15:54.082
And the "A" doesn't
even stand for "Angel,"

15:54.126 --> 15:55.779
for that matter.
It stands for "Achmed,"

15:55.823 --> 15:56.999
a charming foreign
exchange student,

15:57.043 --> 15:58.260
so that whole fantasy part

15:58.304 --> 16:00.001
has nothing to even do
with you at all.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.221
Your mother moved your diary

16:01.264 --> 16:02.264
when she came in
to straighten up.

16:02.308 --> 16:03.788
I watched her from the closet.

16:03.831 --> 16:06.182
I didn't read it, I swear.

16:07.313 --> 16:09.533
Oh.

16:09.576 --> 16:10.926
[softly]:
Oh.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.971
I did a lot
of thinking today.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.495
I really can't
be around you,

16:15.538 --> 16:16.671
because when I am...

16:16.713 --> 16:17.846
Hey.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.674
No big. Water over the bridge.

16:20.717 --> 16:22.590
All I can think about
is how badly I want to kiss you.Under the bridge...

16:22.633 --> 16:24.591
Kiss me?

16:24.634 --> 16:27.942
I'm older than you,
and this can't ever...

16:29.552 --> 16:31.076
I better go.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.514
H-How much older?

16:36.691 --> 16:37.648
I should...

16:37.692 --> 16:38.998
Go...

16:39.040 --> 16:40.563
You said.

17:04.935 --> 17:06.762
What? What is it? What's wrong?

17:06.807 --> 17:08.809
[growling]

17:08.853 --> 17:10.420
[screaming]

17:18.776 --> 17:20.125
[footsteps running away]

17:20.169 --> 17:21.736
Buffy, what happened?

17:23.651 --> 17:25.653
Um, nothing.

17:26.827 --> 17:28.307
I saw a shadow.

17:34.269 --> 17:36.924
Angel's a vampire?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.448
I can't believe
this is happening.

17:38.491 --> 17:42.104
One minute we were kissing,
and the next minute...

17:42.147 --> 17:43.713
Can a vampire ever be
a good person?

17:43.758 --> 17:44.846
Couldn't it happen?

17:44.888 --> 17:46.281
A vampire isn't a person at all.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.588
It may have the movements,
the memories,

17:48.632 --> 17:50.634
even the personality
of the person it took over,

17:50.677 --> 17:52.157
but it's still a demon
at the core.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.897
There is no halfway.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.509
So that'd be a no, huh?

17:56.552 --> 17:57.902
Then what was he doing?

17:57.945 --> 17:59.338
Why was he good to me?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.905
Was it all some part
of the master's plan?

18:01.950 --> 18:04.212
It doesn't make sense.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.692
All right, uh,

18:05.736 --> 18:07.651
you have a problem,
and it's not a small one.

18:07.694 --> 18:08.913
Let's take a breath

18:08.957 --> 18:12.047
and look at this calmly
and objectively.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.614
Angel's a vampire.

18:13.656 --> 18:15.963
You're a slayer.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.009
I think it's obvious
what you have to do.

18:21.186 --> 18:22.449
Uh, it is a slayer's duty.

18:22.491 --> 18:24.406
I-I know you have feelings
for this guy,

18:24.451 --> 18:27.105
but it's not like
you're in love with him, right?

18:28.193 --> 18:29.281
You're in love with a vampire?

18:29.325 --> 18:30.544
What, are you out of your mind?

18:30.586 --> 18:32.588
What?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.548
Not vampire. [chuckles]

18:34.590 --> 18:36.157
How could you love an umpire?

18:36.201 --> 18:37.898
Everyone hates 'em.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.335
Where did you get
that dress?

18:39.378 --> 18:40.596
This is a one-of-a-kind
Todd Oldham.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.251
Do you know how much
this dress cost?

18:43.296 --> 18:46.167
Is this a knock-off?
This is a knock-off, isn't is?

18:46.211 --> 18:47.691
Some cheesy knock-off.

18:47.734 --> 18:49.171
This is exactly
what happens

18:49.214 --> 18:50.867
when you sign these
free-trade agreements.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.957
You think we have problems.

19:18.068 --> 19:19.809
Who's here?

19:19.854 --> 19:21.115
DARLA: A friend.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.900
Hi.

19:22.943 --> 19:25.685
It's been a while.

19:27.730 --> 19:28.905
A lifetime.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.951
Or two. But who's counting?

19:30.994 --> 19:33.259
What's with
the Catholic schoolgirl look?

19:33.301 --> 19:35.478
Last time I saw you,
it was kimonos.

19:35.521 --> 19:37.436
And last time I saw you,

19:37.480 --> 19:39.961
it wasn't high-school girls.

19:40.003 --> 19:41.483
Don't you like?

19:43.094 --> 19:44.356
[giggles]

19:44.400 --> 19:45.923
Remember Budapest,

19:45.967 --> 19:47.576
turn of the century?

19:47.621 --> 19:49.623
You were such a bad boy
during that earthquake.

19:49.665 --> 19:51.538
You did some damage yourself.

19:51.580 --> 19:55.454
Is there anything better
than a natural disaster?

19:55.498 --> 19:56.891
The panic,

19:56.933 --> 19:59.720
the people lost in the streets.

19:59.762 --> 20:02.809
It's like picking fruit
off the vine.

20:04.463 --> 20:06.029
Nice.

20:06.074 --> 20:08.771
You're living aboveground
like one of them.

20:08.816 --> 20:13.255
You and your new friend
are attacking us

20:13.298 --> 20:14.734
like one of them.

20:15.997 --> 20:18.086
But guess what, precious.

20:18.128 --> 20:20.393
You're not one of them.

20:24.134 --> 20:25.310
Are you?

20:25.354 --> 20:26.876
No,

20:26.921 --> 20:28.965
but I'm not exactly
one of you, either.

20:29.009 --> 20:32.012
Is that what
you tell yourself these days?

20:33.188 --> 20:36.451
Hm.

20:36.496 --> 20:39.628
You're not exactly
living off quiche.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.371
You and I both know
what you hunger for,

20:42.414 --> 20:45.287
what you need.

20:45.330 --> 20:47.681
Hey, it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

20:47.723 --> 20:49.248
It's who we are.

20:49.290 --> 20:53.556
It's what makes eternal life
worth living.

20:53.599 --> 20:57.472
You can only suppress
your real nature for so long.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.388
I can feel it brewing
inside of you.

21:00.432 --> 21:02.434
I hope I'm around
when it explodes.

21:02.478 --> 21:05.088
Maybe you don't want to be.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.875
I'm not afraid of you.

21:07.917 --> 21:09.571
I bet she is, though.

21:09.615 --> 21:14.142
Or maybe I'm
underestimating her.

21:14.184 --> 21:15.577
Talk to her.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.057
Tell her about the curse.

21:17.101 --> 21:19.494
Maybe she'll come around,

21:19.538 --> 21:22.324
and if she still
doesn't trust you,

21:22.367 --> 21:24.413
you know where I'll be.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.297
Here's something at last.

21:38.339 --> 21:41.256
Can you please warn us
before you do that?

21:41.299 --> 21:42.997
There's nothing about
Angel in the text,

21:43.039 --> 21:45.520
but it suddenly occurred to me
that it's been ages

21:45.565 --> 21:48.175
since I read the diaries of
any of the watchers before me.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.873
WILLOW: That must have been
so embarrassing

21:49.916 --> 21:51.309
when you thought
he had read your diary,

21:51.353 --> 21:52.528
but then it turned out
he hadn't,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.661
but then he felt the same way.

21:55.878 --> 21:57.097
I'm listening.

21:57.141 --> 21:59.361
There's mention
some 200 years ago

21:59.404 --> 22:02.756
in Ireland of Angelus,
the one with the Angelic face.

22:02.798 --> 22:03.886
You got that right.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.324
[clears throat]

22:05.366 --> 22:07.238
I'm not saying anything.

22:07.281 --> 22:08.935
I have nothing to say.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.589
Did this, uh, Angel have, um,

22:10.633 --> 22:13.027
a tattoo behind
his right shoulder?

22:13.069 --> 22:14.984
Yeah. It's a bird or something.

22:15.028 --> 22:16.203
XANDER:
Now I'm saying something.

22:16.247 --> 22:18.815
You saw him naked?

22:18.858 --> 22:20.338
So Angel's been around
for a while.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.644
Not long for a vampire.

22:21.688 --> 22:23.166
240 years or so.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.951
Huh. 240.

22:24.994 --> 22:27.040
Well, he said he was older.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.781
Angelus leaves Ireland,

22:28.825 --> 22:33.089
uh, wreaks havoc in Europe
for several decades,

22:33.134 --> 22:35.615
and then about 80 years ago,

22:35.657 --> 22:37.660
a most curious
thing happens.

22:37.703 --> 22:40.794
He-he comes to, uh, to America,

22:40.836 --> 22:43.884
um, shuns other vampires
and lives alone.

22:43.926 --> 22:47.234
There's no-no record
of him hunting here.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.237
So he is a good vampire.

22:49.279 --> 22:51.892
I mean, on a scale
of one to ten,

22:51.934 --> 22:54.676
ten being someone who's killing
and maiming every night,

22:54.721 --> 22:57.767
and one being
someone who's... not.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.467
I said that there is no record,
but, uh, vampires hunt and kill.

23:01.509 --> 23:02.945
It's-it's what they do.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.512
Fish gotta swim.
Birds gotta fly.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.166
He could have fed on me.
He didn't.

23:06.210 --> 23:07.907
Question:

23:07.951 --> 23:10.039
100 years or so
before he came to our shores,

23:10.084 --> 23:11.519
what was he like then?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.434
GILES:
Uh, like all of them.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.873
A vicious, violent animal.

23:18.396 --> 23:19.788
Don't think I'm not grateful,

23:19.833 --> 23:21.529
you letting me kill The Three.

23:21.574 --> 23:22.791
How can my children learn

23:22.836 --> 23:25.272
if I do everything for them?

23:25.316 --> 23:27.449
But you've got to let me
take care of the slayer.

23:27.492 --> 23:31.278
Oh! You're giving me orders now.

23:31.321 --> 23:32.976
Okay, then.
We'll just do nothing

23:33.019 --> 23:35.152
while she takes us out
one by one.

23:35.195 --> 23:36.545
Do I sense a plan, Darla?

23:38.025 --> 23:39.417
Share.

23:39.461 --> 23:42.811
Angel kills her
and comes back to the fold.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.596
Angel.

23:44.640 --> 23:48.470
He was the most vicious creature
I ever met.

23:48.513 --> 23:50.211
I miss him.

23:50.253 --> 23:51.342
So do I.

23:53.910 --> 23:56.478
Why would he kill her
if he feels for her?

23:56.521 --> 23:58.740
To keep her from killing him.

24:00.961 --> 24:05.355
You see how we all work together
for the common good.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.795
That's how a family
is supposed to function.

24:08.837 --> 24:10.623
WILLOW:
Okay, so let's review.

24:10.665 --> 24:13.320
Reconstruction began when?

24:13.364 --> 24:14.496
Buffy?

24:14.539 --> 24:17.673
Huh? Oh, um, reconstruction.

24:17.717 --> 24:23.026
Uh, reconstruction began
after the construction,

24:23.069 --> 24:26.073
which was shoddy,
so they had to reconstruct.

24:26.115 --> 24:28.857
After the destruction
of the Civil War.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.990
Right.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.644
Civil War.

24:32.688 --> 24:35.604
During which Angel was already,
like, 100 and change.

24:35.647 --> 24:37.432
Are we gonna
talk about boys,

24:37.476 --> 24:38.912
or are we gonna
help you pass history?

24:41.392 --> 24:42.698
[book shuts]

24:42.741 --> 24:45.440
Sometimes I have this fantasy

24:45.483 --> 24:46.788
that Xander's just gonna grab me

24:46.833 --> 24:48.835
and kiss me right on the lips.

24:48.877 --> 24:51.184
If you want Xander,
you've got to speak up, girl.

24:51.228 --> 24:52.490
No, no, no, no.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.101
No speaking up.

24:54.144 --> 24:57.320
That way leads to madness
and sweaty palms.

24:57.365 --> 25:00.541
Okay, so here's something
I gotta know.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.804
When Angel kissed you--

25:01.847 --> 25:04.502
I mean before he turned into--

25:04.546 --> 25:05.807
how was it?

25:07.027 --> 25:08.594
Unbelievable.

25:08.636 --> 25:10.377
Wow.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.118
And it is kind of novel

25:12.162 --> 25:15.209
how he'll stay young
and handsome forever,

25:15.251 --> 25:17.819
although you'll still
get wrinkly and die,

25:17.864 --> 25:20.387
and, oh,
what about the children?

25:21.693 --> 25:23.086
I'll be quiet now.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.261
No. It's okay.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.741
I need to hear this.

25:26.786 --> 25:29.266
I need to get over him
so I can...

25:29.309 --> 25:30.441
So that you can...

25:31.964 --> 25:34.836
[sighs]
Like Xander said...

25:34.881 --> 25:37.665
I'm the slayer,
and he's a vampire.

25:37.710 --> 25:39.189
God, I can't.

25:39.232 --> 25:40.930
He's never done anything
to hurt me.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.802
Okay, no, I need
to stop thinking about this.

25:43.846 --> 25:45.586
Okay, let's give it
another half an hour

25:45.631 --> 25:47.327
and maybe something
will sink in.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.852
Then I'm going home
for some major moping.

25:49.895 --> 25:53.595
Okay. "The era of the
congressional reconstruction,

25:53.638 --> 25:55.117
usually called radical..."

25:55.162 --> 25:57.294
[dog barking]

26:05.214 --> 26:07.000
[floorboard creaking]

26:12.657 --> 26:14.136
[creaking continues]

26:48.258 --> 26:50.304
[knocking]

26:55.090 --> 26:56.701
[dog barking]

26:58.573 --> 26:59.878
Hello?

26:59.922 --> 27:03.664
Hi. I'm Darla,
a friend of Buffy's.

27:03.709 --> 27:07.451
Oh. Uh, nice to meet you.

27:07.494 --> 27:09.758
[sighs] She didn't
mention anything

27:09.801 --> 27:12.760
about me coming over
for a study date, did she?

27:12.805 --> 27:14.762
No. I thought she was studying
with Willow at the library.

27:14.807 --> 27:16.503
She is.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.375
Willow's the Civil War expert,
but then I was supposed

27:18.419 --> 27:19.898
to help her
with the War of Independence.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.814
My family

27:21.856 --> 27:24.598
kind of goes back to those days.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.252
Well, I-I know
she's supposed to be home soon.

27:26.296 --> 27:27.515
Would you like
to come in and wait?

27:29.865 --> 27:32.693
It's very nice of you
to invite me into your home.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.261
You're welcome.

27:35.305 --> 27:37.916
I've been wrestling
with the IRS all night.

27:37.960 --> 27:39.221
Would you like
something to eat?

27:39.266 --> 27:42.224
Yes, I would.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.531
Let's see what we have.

27:44.575 --> 27:48.057
Do you feel like something
little or something big?

27:48.927 --> 27:50.711
Something big.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.776
[screaming]

28:14.257 --> 28:15.998
ANGEL:
Let her go.

28:16.041 --> 28:17.217
I just had a little.

28:17.259 --> 28:19.393
There's plenty more.

28:19.435 --> 28:20.915
Aren't you hungry
for something warm

28:20.960 --> 28:23.614
after all this time?

28:23.657 --> 28:25.181
Come on, Angel.

28:25.224 --> 28:27.227
Just say yes.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.230
[panting]

28:33.450 --> 28:36.192
[growling]

28:36.236 --> 28:38.367
Welcome home.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.726
BUFFY: Hey...

28:47.769 --> 28:49.989
I'm home.

28:50.031 --> 28:51.424
[growling]

29:05.265 --> 29:07.615
You're not welcome here.

29:07.657 --> 29:11.053
You come near us,
and I'll kill you.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.410
Mom.

29:20.453 --> 29:22.238
Mom, can you hear me?

29:22.281 --> 29:24.240
Yes. I need an ambulance.

29:24.284 --> 29:25.763
1630 Revello Drive.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.634
My mother cut herself.

29:27.678 --> 29:28.854
She lost a lot of blood.

29:28.896 --> 29:30.159
Please, please hurry.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.334
Mom?

29:31.377 --> 29:32.596
XANDER:
Hey, Buffy?

29:34.163 --> 29:35.861
Oh, my God.What happened?

29:35.903 --> 29:37.078
Angel.

29:40.734 --> 29:42.258
Do you remember
anything, Mom?

29:42.301 --> 29:46.348
Just, um, your friend came over.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.221
I was going
to make a snack.

29:48.263 --> 29:49.961
My friend?

29:50.005 --> 29:53.355
I guess I slipped
and cut my neck on...

29:53.400 --> 29:57.185
The doctor said it looked
like a barbecue fork.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.840
We don't have a barbecue fork.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.236
Are you another doctor?

30:03.278 --> 30:04.324
Oh. Um...

30:04.366 --> 30:07.500
No. Mom, this is Mr. Giles.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.286
The librarian from your school.

30:10.329 --> 30:11.809
What's he doing here?

30:11.853 --> 30:14.334
I-I just came
to pay my respects,

30:14.376 --> 30:16.291
wish you a speedy recovery.

30:16.336 --> 30:19.773
Boy, the teachers really do
care in this town.

30:19.817 --> 30:20.862
Get some rest now.

30:20.905 --> 30:22.167
Mm.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.656
She's gonna be okay.

30:33.701 --> 30:36.224
They-they gave her
some iron.

30:36.269 --> 30:39.663
Her, uh, blood count
was, um, a little...

30:39.707 --> 30:40.882
GILES:
A little low.

30:40.925 --> 30:42.971
It presents itself
like mild anemia.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.885
You were, uh,
you were lucky

30:44.930 --> 30:46.670
you got to her
as soon as you did.

30:46.713 --> 30:47.714
Lucky?

30:47.758 --> 30:48.759
Stupid.

30:48.802 --> 30:50.369
Buff,
it's not your fault.

30:50.413 --> 30:51.458
No?

30:51.500 --> 30:53.328
I invited him into my home,

30:53.373 --> 30:56.506
even after I knew
who he was, what he was.

30:56.549 --> 30:57.898
And I didn't do anything
about it,

30:57.942 --> 31:00.467
because I had
feelings for him,

31:00.509 --> 31:02.337
because I cared about him.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.992
If you care about somebody,
you care about them.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.038
You can't change that by...

31:07.082 --> 31:08.692
Killing them?

31:08.736 --> 31:10.215
Maybe not.

31:10.259 --> 31:11.826
But I think it's a start.

31:11.869 --> 31:13.914
We'll keep an eye
on your mom.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.263
Buffy.

31:15.307 --> 31:16.917
You can't stop me.

31:16.961 --> 31:18.397
The Three found me near
the Bronze and so did he.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.834
He lives nearby.

31:19.877 --> 31:21.443
This is no ordinary vampire...

31:21.488 --> 31:22.750
if there is such a thing.

31:22.792 --> 31:24.446
Now he knows you.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.101
He's-he's faced The Three.

31:26.144 --> 31:28.103
I think this is going to
take more than a simple stake.

31:28.146 --> 31:29.844
So do I.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.677
DARLA: She's out
hunting you right now.

31:37.721 --> 31:38.808
She wants to kill you.

31:38.853 --> 31:40.768
Leave me alone.

31:40.810 --> 31:42.813
What did you think?

31:42.856 --> 31:45.207
Did you think
she would understand?

31:45.250 --> 31:47.339
That she would look
at your face,

31:47.383 --> 31:49.777
your true face...

31:49.819 --> 31:51.822
and give you a kiss?

31:52.519 --> 31:54.259
For 100 years,

31:54.302 --> 31:55.391
you've not had
a moment's peace

31:55.434 --> 31:56.435
because you will not accept

31:56.479 --> 31:57.827
who you are.

31:57.872 --> 32:00.308
That's all you have to do.

32:00.353 --> 32:01.832
Accept it.

32:01.875 --> 32:04.269
Don't let her hunt you down.

32:04.313 --> 32:07.621
Don't whimper and mewl
like a mangy human.

32:07.663 --> 32:09.275
Kill.

32:09.317 --> 32:10.492
Feed.

32:10.537 --> 32:12.233
Live.

32:13.583 --> 32:15.324
All right.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.717
What do you want?

32:16.759 --> 32:18.326
I want it finished.

32:18.371 --> 32:19.720
That's good.

32:19.762 --> 32:22.330
You're hurting me.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.768
That's good, too.

32:45.484 --> 32:47.226
[glass breaking]

33:01.240 --> 33:03.241
JOYCE: She talks about you
all the time.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.548
It's important to have teachers

33:05.592 --> 33:06.984
who make an impression.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.942
She makes quite
an impression herself.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.771
I-I know she's having trouble
with history.

33:11.815 --> 33:13.730
I-Is-is it too difficult
for her,

33:13.773 --> 33:15.731
or is she not
applying herself?

33:15.776 --> 33:17.256
She lives very much in the now,

33:17.298 --> 33:19.039
um, and, uh, well,
history, of course,

33:19.084 --> 33:20.693
is-is very much about the, uh...

33:20.737 --> 33:21.912
the "then."

33:21.955 --> 33:23.131
But-but there's no reason...

33:23.174 --> 33:24.349
She's studying
with Willow.

33:24.393 --> 33:25.873
She's studying with Darla.

33:25.915 --> 33:27.221
I-I mean, she is trying.

33:27.266 --> 33:28.788
Darla?

33:28.832 --> 33:31.009
I-I don't believe I know, uh...

33:31.051 --> 33:33.097
Her friend-- the one
who came over tonight.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.750
Darla came
to your house tonight?

33:34.795 --> 33:36.839
She's the friend
that you mentioned earlier?

33:36.884 --> 33:38.058
Poor thing.
I must have frightened her

33:38.103 --> 33:40.018
half to death when I fainted.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.888
Someone should really check
and make sure she's all right.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.239
Uh, yes. Someone should.
Right away.

33:44.282 --> 33:45.500
I'll do it.

33:46.501 --> 33:48.634
That school is amazing.

33:48.677 --> 33:50.767
We have a problem.

34:08.742 --> 34:12.702
I know you're there...

34:12.746 --> 34:14.139
and I know what you are.

34:14.181 --> 34:15.530
ANGEL: Do you?

34:15.574 --> 34:17.228
I'm just an animal,
right?

34:17.271 --> 34:18.838
You're not an animal.

34:18.882 --> 34:21.014
Animals I like.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.755
[growling]

34:25.454 --> 34:27.369
Let's get it done.

34:28.282 --> 34:29.458
[growling]

34:41.818 --> 34:43.255
[grunting]

34:51.784 --> 34:53.177
[growling]

35:01.447 --> 35:02.664
[growling]

35:04.710 --> 35:06.146
Come on.

35:06.190 --> 35:08.409
Don't go soft on me now.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.458
A little wide.
Why?

35:15.112 --> 35:16.592
Why didn't you just attack me

35:16.635 --> 35:18.159
when you had the chance?

35:18.202 --> 35:20.422
Was it a joke?

35:20.465 --> 35:23.686
To make me feel for you
and then...

35:25.034 --> 35:27.211
I've killed a lot of vampires.

35:27.255 --> 35:28.864
I've never hated one before.

35:28.909 --> 35:30.563
Feels good, doesn't it?

35:30.606 --> 35:32.391
Feels simple.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.436
I invited you into my home,
and then you attacked my family.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.436
Why not?

35:35.481 --> 35:37.177
I killed mine.

35:37.222 --> 35:38.527
I killed their friends...

35:40.920 --> 35:42.530
...and their friends'
children.

35:42.574 --> 35:43.967
For 100 years,

35:44.010 --> 35:46.840
I offered an ugly death
to everyone I met.

35:46.882 --> 35:50.016
And I did it
with a song in my heart.

35:50.059 --> 35:51.322
What changed?

35:51.365 --> 35:52.846
Fed on a girl about your age.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.804
Beautiful.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.197
Dumb as a post,

35:57.242 --> 35:59.635
but a favorite among her clan.

35:59.679 --> 36:00.635
Her clan?

36:00.679 --> 36:02.637
The Romany.

36:02.681 --> 36:04.726
Gypsies.

36:04.771 --> 36:07.164
The elders conjured
the perfect punishment for me.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.905
They restored my soul.

36:09.949 --> 36:12.257
What, they were all out of boils
and blinding torment?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.215
When you become a vampire,
the demon takes your body,

36:14.259 --> 36:16.434
but it doesn't get your soul.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.219
That's gone.

36:18.262 --> 36:21.222
No conscience,
no remorse.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.789
It's an easy way to live.

36:22.831 --> 36:24.833
You have no idea what it's like

36:24.878 --> 36:27.054
to have done the things
I've done...

36:28.489 --> 36:30.753
...and to care.

36:30.797 --> 36:34.800
I haven't fed on a living
human being since that day.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.672
So you started with my mom?I didn't bite her.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.545
Then why didn't you
say something?

36:39.588 --> 36:41.851
But I wanted to.

36:41.894 --> 36:45.768
I can walk like a man,
but I'm not one.

36:45.811 --> 36:48.554
I wanted to kill you tonight.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.356
Go ahead.

37:16.755 --> 37:19.498
Not as easy as it looks.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.760
DARLA:
Sure it is.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.329
[chuckles]

37:24.371 --> 37:25.851
We're near the Bronze. What now?

37:25.894 --> 37:27.201
Keep looking for her.

37:27.244 --> 37:29.246
I have a question.
What if we find her

37:29.289 --> 37:31.204
and she's fighting Angel
and some of his friends?

37:31.248 --> 37:33.554
What the heck are we
going to do about it?

37:33.599 --> 37:34.903
Do you know what
the saddest thing

37:34.947 --> 37:36.297
in the world is?

37:36.340 --> 37:38.125
Bad hair
on top of that outfit?

37:38.168 --> 37:40.954
To love someone
who used to love you.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.652
You guys were involved?

37:44.697 --> 37:46.001
For several generations.

37:46.045 --> 37:47.307
Well,

37:47.351 --> 37:48.831
you've been around
since Columbus.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.007
You are bound to pile up
a few exes.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.226
You're older than him,
right?

37:52.269 --> 37:54.010
Just between us girls,

37:54.054 --> 37:55.882
you are looking
a little worn around the eyes.

37:57.099 --> 37:58.927
I made him.

37:58.972 --> 38:00.320
There was a time

38:00.364 --> 38:02.192
when we shared everything,
wasn't there, Angelus?

38:03.672 --> 38:05.717
You had a chance
to come home,

38:05.760 --> 38:08.286
to rule with me in the
master's court for 1,000 years.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.809
But you threw that away
because of her.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.028
You love someone
who hates us.

38:13.072 --> 38:14.726
You're sick,

38:14.769 --> 38:17.773
and you'll always be sick.

38:17.817 --> 38:19.208
And you'll always remember

38:19.253 --> 38:22.038
what it was like
to watch her die.

38:24.650 --> 38:26.739
You don't think
I came alone, do you?

38:26.782 --> 38:28.306
I know I didn't.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.309
[chuckles]

38:31.351 --> 38:33.005
Scary.

38:33.048 --> 38:35.050
Scarier.

38:37.052 --> 38:39.751
Oh, don't worry.
Bullets can't kill vampires.

38:39.795 --> 38:43.059
They can hurt them
like hell, but...

38:47.063 --> 38:48.847
Did you just hear...

38:48.891 --> 38:50.806
[gunshots continue]

38:50.849 --> 38:52.112
So many body parts,

38:52.155 --> 38:53.853
so few bullets.

38:53.896 --> 38:56.376
[chuckles]
Let's begin with the kneecaps.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.813
No fun dancing without them.

39:12.914 --> 39:14.134

39:14.177 --> 39:15.614
We need to distract her...

39:15.657 --> 39:17.266
fast.

39:17.311 --> 39:18.791
Buffy, it wasn't Angel

39:18.833 --> 39:20.487
who attacked your mom!
It was Darla!

39:36.983 --> 39:38.027
[gunshots continue]

39:52.867 --> 39:54.391
[electrical buzzing]

39:58.177 --> 40:00.266
Come on, Buffy.

40:00.309 --> 40:02.661

40:50.403 --> 40:52.231
Forget her.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.974
How dare you.

40:55.016 --> 40:57.889
She was my favorite...

40:57.932 --> 41:00.893
for 400 years.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.242
She was weak.

41:02.284 --> 41:04.461
We don't need her.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.985
I'll bring you
the slayer.

41:07.028 --> 41:09.641
But to lose her to Angel.

41:09.684 --> 41:13.905
He was to have sat
at my right hand come the day.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.342
And now...

41:15.385 --> 41:17.518
They're all against you.

41:17.561 --> 41:19.346
But soon you shall rise.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.391
And when you do...

41:24.003 --> 41:25.570
...we kill them all.

41:36.405 --> 41:38.974
XANDER: Ah,
the post-fumigation party.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.541
Okay, so what's
the difference between this

41:40.585 --> 41:41.934
and the pre-fumigation party?

41:41.976 --> 41:45.327
Much hardier
cockroaches.

41:45.371 --> 41:48.548
So, no word from Angel?

41:48.592 --> 41:50.637
Nah.

41:51.552 --> 41:53.206
It's weird, though.

41:53.248 --> 41:56.382
In his way, I feel like
he's still watching me.

41:56.425 --> 41:58.777
Well, in a way,
he sort of is.
