ELEMENTARY #702
"Gutshot"
Closed Captioned

00:01.293 --> 00:04.379
Previously on Elementary...
You have to tell the FBI.

00:04.379 --> 00:05.839
If it weren't for you,

00:05.839 --> 00:07.841
my little girl
wouldn't be a killer.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.426
I'm the only one
who could confess

00:09.426 --> 00:11.011
without going to prison.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.054
MALLICK:
The Brits won't extradite him.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.597
They made that very clear.

00:13.597 --> 00:16.058
He isn't allowed to set foot
in the U.S. ever again.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.185
Sherlock Holmes isn't
America's problem anymore.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.561
Everything that went down
between you

00:19.561 --> 00:21.230
and Sherlock and Joan,

00:21.230 --> 00:23.232
you got to get past it.
Marcus...

00:23.232 --> 00:25.442
No. They never did
anything but right by us.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.195
I'm gonna call them
tomorrow, apologize.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.988
Captain?
BELL: Actually, it's me.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.240
Marcus.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.741
Sorry I'm calling like this.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.035
The captain-- he's been shot.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.036
It's bad.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.504
(tires screeching in distance)

00:45.504 --> 00:48.799
Banksy ain't got
nothing on you, yo.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.717
(brakes screech, metal crashing)
What the hell was that?

01:01.103 --> 01:02.354
What you doing?

01:02.354 --> 01:03.730
Calling 911.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.192
Are you crazy?
Look at your hands.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.777
They're gonna know it was you
who did all that graffiti.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.279
We can't just leave him
here like this.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.072
ARNOLD:
He's a drunk driver, man.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.282
He did this to himself.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.783
No, man, look at his back.

01:16.493 --> 01:17.786
I think that's a bullet hole.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.497
Whatever, man. I'm out.

01:28.964 --> 01:31.216
TREMAINE:
Obviously I called.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.844
The cops and the ambulance,
they got there fast.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.638
Then, all of a sudden,
there was more cops and more.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.640
I thought, shoot.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.393
This must be what it's like
when a white dude gets shot.

01:41.393 --> 01:45.480
I didn't know he was Five-O
till later.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.691
You know I told all this to
the cops that came that night,

01:47.691 --> 01:49.401
right?

01:49.401 --> 01:53.405
Yeah, but the shooting victim,

01:53.405 --> 01:55.657
he's my friend.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.161
I wanted to talk to you myself.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.288
I wanted to thank you.

02:07.002 --> 02:09.504
Um, I need a minute, Tremaine.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.340
Sit tight.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.720
Hey.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.139
I came straight
from the airport.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.682
I didn't mean to interrupt.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.101
No, it's okay. He's, uh,

02:23.101 --> 02:24.519
he's the one
who found the captain.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.480
I was just making
sure the guys

02:26.480 --> 02:28.148
who talked to him the night of
hadn't missed anything.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.524
And?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.318
Everything I told you
when I called

02:31.318 --> 02:32.944
is everything we know.

02:32.944 --> 02:34.446
Is the captain doing any better?

02:34.446 --> 02:36.531
Same.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.700
He still hasn't
regained consciousness.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.161
He keeps needing transfusions.
The docs think

02:41.161 --> 02:42.537
there may be something in there
still bleeding.

02:42.537 --> 02:43.622
They might have to go back in.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.917
I want to see him,
but I also want to help

02:46.917 --> 02:48.126
with the investigation.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.462
Kind of figured you would.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.798
Look, if you think
it's gonna be a problem

02:52.798 --> 02:54.716
because of everything
that happened last year...

02:54.716 --> 02:56.510
Hey. You're not the one
who confessed

02:56.510 --> 02:58.720
to Michael Rowan's murder.
Sherlock was.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.971
Anyone has a problem
with you being here,

02:59.971 --> 03:02.849
they can take it up with me.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.768
How is he, by the way?

03:04.768 --> 03:06.978
Your partner?

03:06.978 --> 03:08.355
Must've killed him
to have to stay in London.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.815
You have no idea.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.441
But the deal he made
with the FBI

03:11.441 --> 03:12.984
was pretty clear.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.278
If he comes back to the
U.S., he gets arrested.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.863
I'm gonna keep him in the loop,

03:16.863 --> 03:18.198
and he's gonna do
what he can from there.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.450
This isn't how I wanted
to see you,

03:20.450 --> 03:22.786
but I'm glad you're here.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.872
I'm glad I'm here, too.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.293
(door opens)

03:49.855 --> 03:52.149
HOLMES:
Well?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.653
Did he buy it?

03:56.653 --> 03:59.322
Yeah. He bought it.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.751
WATSON:
The gas isn't working, either.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.921
I just spoke to Wiggins.
He assures me the utilities

04:14.921 --> 04:16.631
will be turned back on
by this evening.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.468
What about the furniture? He
said he was gonna rent us some?

04:19.468 --> 04:21.303
As far as he's concerned,
he's renting some for you.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.180
He thinks I'm still in England.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.975
Are we gonna have beds
to sleep on tonight or not?

04:26.975 --> 04:29.478
The furniture should arrive
no later than 5:00 p.m.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.938
Remind me why we're
not staying someplace else?

04:31.938 --> 04:33.440
This was more than just our home
for six years.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.900
This was our
laboratory.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.277
Our sanctum sanctorum.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.488
Where else to tackle
a case so important?

04:39.488 --> 04:42.407
I don't know, someplace where
there's with a working toilet?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.001
VoilÃ .

04:55.337 --> 04:57.422
WATSON:
I still don't understand

04:57.422 --> 04:59.508
why you wouldn't let
Lin sell this place.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.135
Anyone who sells real estate
in New York

05:02.135 --> 05:04.179
when they don't have to
is a fool.

05:04.179 --> 05:06.473
Besides, this place
is your inheritance.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.266
Yeah, but still...

05:08.266 --> 05:10.560
You said the captain's condition
was unchanged?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.604
What about the investigation?

05:12.604 --> 05:13.980
I'm afraid
the prognosis on that

05:13.980 --> 05:15.774
is also pretty grim.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.693
All Marcus knows is what
he told us when he called.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.445
The captain was driving home
from the precinct.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.696
Somewhere along
the way, he stopped,

05:21.696 --> 05:22.822
he got out of his car.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.407
Gunfire was exchanged.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.660
He was shot once in the abdomen,
once in the back.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.038
He got back in his car, drove
away and crashed it in Flushing.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.623
So they still haven't identified
the scene of the crime.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.000
They don't know exactly
where he was gunned down.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.795
Could be he was tricked into
pulling over for the shooter,

05:36.795 --> 05:39.464
or he was ambushed when
he stopped to run an errand.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.800
Either way, the one thing
that everyone can agree on

05:41.800 --> 05:43.343
is that it wasn't random.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.345
I imagine there's something else
everyone can agree on:

05:45.345 --> 05:47.889
a police captain, with decades
of service to the NYPD,

05:47.889 --> 05:50.308
would have made literally
thousands of enemies.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.102
Our suspect pool is huge.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.521
How's Marcus?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.523
Okay, all things considered.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.649
Did he mention the Marshals?

05:57.649 --> 05:59.109
He reached out
to them yesterday.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.485
He told them
that he was not gonna

06:00.485 --> 06:01.736
report for training next week.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.363
He said that
he didn't feel right

06:03.363 --> 06:05.073
leaving the 11th
at a time like this.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.118
Well, their loss is our gain.

06:08.118 --> 06:11.288
(phone chiming)

06:11.288 --> 06:14.374
It's Paige.
I texted her to see

06:14.374 --> 06:15.792
when I could go see
the captain at the hospital.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.919
She says I can come now.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.045
I'd say you should join, but...

06:19.045 --> 06:20.880
But I'm wanted
by the FBI for murder.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.717
It's just as well.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.010
I'm going to retrace the path

06:25.010 --> 06:26.636
between the precinct
and the crash site.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.430
Any luck, I'll find the scene
of the shooting as well.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.809
Are you sure
you want to do this?

06:32.809 --> 06:35.520
Stay in New York. If the
feds realize you're here...

06:35.520 --> 06:37.063
You didn't think
I'd sneak through customs

06:37.063 --> 06:39.649
with a false passport,
but I did.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.943
Anyway, we're not planning
on staying here for too long.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.069
We'll find
the captain's shooter,

06:43.069 --> 06:44.863
point Marcus in his
or her direction,

06:44.863 --> 06:45.989
and then go back to London.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.490
Considering it's us,

06:47.490 --> 06:48.742
that should take, what,
three days?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.953
Four at the absolute maximum.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.213
He calls me every time
he's on his way home.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.633
That was part of the deal
when we got married.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.261
I get that call,
I know he's safe.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.055
He made it through
another day.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.807
I don't have to worry
about him anymore.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.893
My phone rang
the other night.

07:14.893 --> 07:18.563
I relaxed.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.565
Only it wasn't him.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.735
It was Marcus

07:23.735 --> 07:25.278
calling to let me know...

07:27.364 --> 07:30.909
So the day it happened, did
he say anything about stopping

07:30.909 --> 07:32.702
somewhere on
his way home?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.579
No.
What about his
recent caseload?

07:34.579 --> 07:37.916
Did he mention any problems
with anyone, any threats?

07:37.916 --> 07:39.417
No.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.088
But if somebody
had threatened him,

07:43.088 --> 07:45.256
I don't think
he would have told me.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.759
He didn't like
to bring that stuff home.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.427
I didn't either,
when I was on the job.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.432
Have you even been home
since all this happened?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.603
Hannah's gonna bring me
some stuff. I'll be fine.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.607
I like the hair.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.443
It suits you.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.903
Thanks.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.826
I changed my look
this year, too.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.369
In case you couldn't tell.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.870
Numbness in the legs?

08:15.870 --> 08:19.624
It's MS, the gift
that keeps on giving.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.378
How's your partner doing?

08:23.378 --> 08:25.422
He's good.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.881
He wishes he
could be here.

08:26.881 --> 08:28.466
I know you two
aren't cops,

08:28.466 --> 08:30.427
but your work is dangerous, too.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.012
Make sure he takes
care of himself

08:33.012 --> 08:35.014
while you're out of town, okay?

08:35.014 --> 08:38.768
Thanks. But I'm sure he's fine.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.355
Anything?

08:42.355 --> 08:45.358
Nah, man. Nothing.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.027
Ain't you gonna get up now?

08:48.027 --> 08:51.114
Reenacting elements
of a traumatic incident

08:51.114 --> 08:55.618
can help flesh out the memories
of those who witnessed it.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.246
But I told you,
I didn't witness anything.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.041
I didn't see the dude crash,
I just heard it.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.084
What is it you want me
to remember, anyway?

09:03.084 --> 09:06.463
A scent, a sound.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.256
Anything that could
help me identify

09:08.256 --> 09:10.675
where he was coming from
before he crashed.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.260
Like, if I smelled pizza,
you'd go check out

09:12.260 --> 09:13.636
all the pizza places
around here?

09:13.636 --> 09:14.888
Did you smell pizza?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.348
Nah. It's just an example.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.976
The man who was shot began his
journey at the 11th precinct.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.895
I've retraced that path twice
now and haven't been able

09:21.895 --> 09:23.062
to identify
where he was ambushed.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.397
Why is it important?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.774
Because there might be
something there

09:25.774 --> 09:27.150
that could help me identify
the shooter.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.278
DNA, a fingerprint.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.530
Can I go now?
I paid you for the hour.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.032
I know.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.909
But I already told you
everything I know.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.536
Just like I told
the cops twice.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.914
I heard brakes, then a crash.
I found a dude lying

09:40.914 --> 09:42.999
on the ground
and I called 911.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.627
You said you heard brakes.
So?

09:45.627 --> 09:46.961
You didn't mention anything
about brakes before.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.505
Course I did.
No, you didn't.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.007
Also, there aren't
any skid marks here.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.926
The captain's car slammed into

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
that column
without slowing down.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.972
Right. I heard the brakes
a few seconds before the crash.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.307
How many seconds?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.226
Maybe three?

10:01.226 --> 10:03.144
Three.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.607
Hey-- what...?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.695
You think those
are from your friend?

10:12.695 --> 10:15.406
Note the curvature.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.450
He was traveling
at a very high speed

10:17.450 --> 10:20.370
as he approached the corner,
then he slammed on his brakes.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.622
Dude was in worse
shape than I thought.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.749
He was going the wrong way
down a one-way street.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.417
Well, the fact that he was
driving the wrong way

10:26.417 --> 10:27.752
as he fled for his life
is not that surprising.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.212
What is surprising

10:29.212 --> 10:31.047
is that these marks indicate
he wasn't coming

10:31.047 --> 10:32.757
from the direction
of the 11th precinct,

10:32.757 --> 10:34.425
but an entirely different
direction.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.970
We've been looking
for the scene of the shooting

10:36.970 --> 10:38.930
along the wrong route.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.977
(scoffs)

10:45.937 --> 10:49.315
Guessing the power is still off.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.360
HOLMES: I'm assured it'll be
turned on by noon tomorrow.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.571
You know, when a utility
company says tomorrow,

10:54.571 --> 10:57.574
they really mean
next week, right?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.242
Where is all the
rental furniture?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.952
Delayed.
But have no fear.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.829
I went to an army surplus store

11:02.829 --> 11:06.416
and got us a couple of cots.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.126
New or used?

11:08.126 --> 11:11.045
Does it matter?
How's the captain?

11:11.045 --> 11:13.214
Bad. Nothing's changed.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.465
He's still
in critical condition.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.760
It's hard seeing him that way.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.680
I take it you received my text.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.432
So, you don't think
he took his usual route

11:22.432 --> 11:24.267
from the 11th to his house
the night he was shot?

11:24.267 --> 11:26.644
The police assumed that he had
because the place

11:26.644 --> 11:28.396
where he crashed his car
was on that route,

11:28.396 --> 11:32.358
but in addition
to the skid marks I found here,

11:32.358 --> 11:35.278
I also found
a booted car here.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.989
It had recently
been sideswiped.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.490
The paint chips
in evidence suggest

11:39.490 --> 11:41.993
that the offending vehicle
was a dark blue Crown Victoria.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.494
Same as the captain's.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.996
Mm.
Odds are

11:44.996 --> 11:47.040
he wasn't tricked into
pulling over on his way home.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.917
He stopped somewhere
after work.

11:48.917 --> 11:52.086
Somewhere at least one mile
out of his way.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.421
The problem is,

11:53.421 --> 11:55.006
there's no way of telling
where he was coming from

11:55.006 --> 11:57.050
before he sideswiped
that car.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.344
He was heading south

11:59.344 --> 12:03.097
before he turned onto the street
with the booted car.

12:03.097 --> 12:06.517
So, Marcus gave me copies
of everything the police have.

12:06.517 --> 12:10.521
This is what the captain was
wearing the night he was shot.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.274
CSU took photos of it before
they sent it to the lab.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.568
They thought
that was more blood,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.362
but the color looked off to me.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.114
It's hard to tell
from a photograph,

12:20.114 --> 12:22.450
but it looks more like a
reddish dirt, maybe clay.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.620
I think it's a mixture of both.
That is a baseball field.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.288
Most baseball fields

12:27.288 --> 12:29.123
use a mixture
of clay and dirt

12:29.123 --> 12:30.750
on their base paths.
What if this is

12:30.750 --> 12:32.001
where the captain was
the night he was shot?

12:38.132 --> 12:41.386
It's a .380, just like the
bullets that struck the captain.

12:44.138 --> 12:48.810
So, the shooter
maybe stood here?

12:51.145 --> 12:55.149
And he shot at the
captain, who was...

12:55.149 --> 12:57.860
where?

12:57.860 --> 12:59.237
HOLMES:
There.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.336
Looks like not all the shooter's
bullets found the captain.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.047
This must be

13:18.047 --> 13:20.341
from one that did.

13:20.341 --> 13:24.012
So, he was shot here,

13:24.012 --> 13:25.888
returns fire,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.849
and then he runs off
that way,

13:27.849 --> 13:29.976
stumbles on the base path,

13:29.976 --> 13:32.645
got into his car
and sped away.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.522
I need to call Marcus.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.107
Tell him we found
the crime scene.

13:36.107 --> 13:40.653
Well, we could
or we could stay here,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.238
try and find out

13:42.238 --> 13:43.740
what the captain was
doing here that night.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.283
Obviously, there wasn't
a game being played.

13:45.283 --> 13:48.286
There would've been
dozens of witnesses.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.537
Someone would have
called the police.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.915
(sniffs)

13:52.915 --> 13:54.208
What is it?

13:56.335 --> 13:58.713
Smell that.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.548
Is that lye?

14:00.548 --> 14:02.091
Excuse me.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.058
(Holmes grunts)

14:20.651 --> 14:22.445
Well, I can't be certain...

14:24.280 --> 14:25.448
...but I think this
has something to do

14:25.448 --> 14:26.657
with the captain's visit.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.212
Kind of feel bad putting
him back in another wall.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.964
Good news is we were
able to make an ID.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.049
Tim Bledsoe.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.468
Local kid, went to community
college in Queens.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.678
Bledsoe. Do I
know that name?

14:47.678 --> 14:49.764
You might remember
his missing person poster.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.599
His mother reported his
disappearance eight months ago.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.142
The detective
who handled the case

14:53.142 --> 14:55.353
pulled his file so I could
check a few things.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.522
Dental records are
a perfect match.

14:57.522 --> 15:00.233
My report's got
standard notes on decomp.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.276
Cause of death was
multiple gunshot wounds.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.570
You pulled a .380 slug
from his skull.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.739
Same caliber they took
out of the captain.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.742
So, fits what we thought.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.077
He went to look
for Tim's body,

15:11.077 --> 15:12.245
but the killer made sure
that didn't happen.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.704
Be nice if we could ask him

15:13.704 --> 15:14.497
how he ended up at
the baseball field.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.623
(phone ringing)
Excuse me.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.667
We should go, too.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.460
Got our work
cut out for us.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.920
Figure I'll invite
everyone mentioned

15:20.920 --> 15:23.714
in the missing persons
file down for a chat.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.133
Talk to the construction company
that built the snack bar

15:25.133 --> 15:26.717
at that field, too.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.262
I'll go talk to his mother.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.888
If she's the one
who reported him missing,

15:30.888 --> 15:33.266
then she's had longer
than anyone to think about

15:33.266 --> 15:34.559
who would hurt her son.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.730
So, what'd you want
to ask me, Mr....?

15:39.730 --> 15:41.065
I'm sorry,
I can't think straight.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.108
It's Ms. Watson and...

15:42.108 --> 15:44.277
Harlan Emple.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.987
We're consultants
with the department.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.447
I'm sorry. There've been people
in and out all morning.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.949
Of course.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.659
Your son's case is
very important to us.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.328
It never was before.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.914
But maybe that
was for the best.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.000
If I just let it lie,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.668
that police captain
I talked to,

16:00.668 --> 16:02.962
he wouldn't have
gotten hurt.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
Actually, we wanted
to talk to you about him.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.174
We were wondering how
he got onto the case.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.466
Are you saying that
you brought it to him?

16:07.466 --> 16:09.594
Yeah. A couple
weeks back.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.262
I read about a missing
girl they found,

16:11.262 --> 16:13.598
the Major Case Squad.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.975
I thought, that's who should've
been looking for my Tim.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.894
Those detectives
at the beginning,

16:17.894 --> 16:20.563
I never really thought they
were looking too hard.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.814
They never listened to me.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.066
They listened to my ex
'cause he's on the job.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.568
And that would be Tim's father?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.361
Yeah, Marty Bledsoe.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.739
He's a sergeant with the 16th.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.200
When Tim disappeared,
Marty told everyone,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.493
"Oh, he's just run off."

16:34.493 --> 16:37.038
He sounded so sure,
I even wanted to believe it,

16:37.038 --> 16:41.500
but then Tim's birthday
rolls by, then my birthday,

16:41.500 --> 16:43.586
still no word from him.
It started to sink in.

16:43.586 --> 16:47.048
Something awful
must've happened.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.799
And the detectives
handling the disappearance

16:48.799 --> 16:50.593
didn't agree?

16:50.593 --> 16:53.095
Tim's last years
were pretty bad.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.680
He got in fights.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.350
He drank.
There might've been some drugs.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.602
Most people would believe
Tim was the kind of kid

16:59.602 --> 17:01.938
to drop off the map.

17:01.938 --> 17:05.942
Anyone in his orbit stand out
as capable of violence?

17:05.942 --> 17:06.943
I don't know.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.903
(scoffs)
All of them.

17:08.903 --> 17:11.072
Tim mostly kept to himself,

17:11.072 --> 17:12.949
but the people he did
hang around with were no good.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.909
It's part of why Tim and
Marty fought so much,

17:14.909 --> 17:17.328
part of why me
and Marty fought, too.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.164
You've mentioned
your ex twice now.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.000
You think he did this,
don't you?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.379
Captain Gregson wanted
to tread lightly.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.423
That's why he was looking
into Tim's case himself.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.967
But I've gone to bed every
night for eight months

17:30.967 --> 17:32.760
thinking the same thing:

17:32.760 --> 17:35.054
Marty sure did a good
job of keeping the police

17:35.054 --> 17:36.681
from looking too
hard for our son.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.978
This is some sick joke,

17:41.978 --> 17:44.772
calling me in like I'm
some kind of criminal.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.401
Your ex-wife asked my boss to
take a look at your son's case,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.361
to take a look at you.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.571
Now he's on life support
at St. Bede's.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.157
Yeah.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.368
You know, somewhere on my list
of things that make today

17:57.368 --> 17:59.078
the worst day of my life
is knowing that Elise

17:59.078 --> 18:02.081
thinks that somehow
I could hurt our son.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.833
Why would
she think that?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.751
I don't know.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.462
She always blamed me
for facing the truth.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.339
She was too weak
to do that.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.384
And what's the truth?

18:13.384 --> 18:17.013
That Tim was a bad seed.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.307
And it broke my heart realizing
that there was no reaching him,

18:19.307 --> 18:21.058
but there wasn't.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.936
The file in his disappearance,

18:23.936 --> 18:26.355
it lists a few people
Tim got mixed up with,

18:26.355 --> 18:28.816
some minor incidents at school.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.860
I don't see anything here
that makes him a bad seed.

18:30.860 --> 18:35.364
Well, you can
thank me for that.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.743
I mean, it kind of helps having
a police sergeant for a father.

18:38.743 --> 18:41.287
I can't tell you how many
times I had charges squashed:

18:41.287 --> 18:43.998
vandalism,
public intoxication,

18:43.998 --> 18:46.375
grand theft auto.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.462
Like I said, bad seed.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.050
He was such a sweet, little boy.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.973
But me and Elise, uh...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.268
we lost him a long time ago.

19:04.268 --> 19:07.980
What can you tell me
about eight months ago?

19:07.980 --> 19:12.651
You want to hear it? Fine.

19:12.651 --> 19:17.448
I loved that kid, right up
until he made it impossible.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.825
But even then, come on.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.871
I would never hurt him.
I didn't.

19:23.871 --> 19:25.664
And, I mean, if you
need alibis, I got 'em.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.708
More than one?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.668
For Tim and
your captain.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.088
Week my boy went missing,
I was fishing in Canada

19:32.088 --> 19:34.507
with a couple of buddies.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.467
And last Thursday,
time of the shooting,

19:36.467 --> 19:38.260
I was at home with
my girlfriend.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.012
You can ask her.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.223
(sighs)

19:42.223 --> 19:43.891
You should go home.

19:45.059 --> 19:48.020
(sighs)

19:48.020 --> 19:51.774
Listen, if you want...

19:51.774 --> 19:54.485
I got a few names that
probably aren't on that list.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.071
Folks you ought to talk to.

19:57.071 --> 20:00.199
Like I said, I cleaned up
a lot of his messes.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.787
Stanley Veek.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.455
I'm a professor
at Goldbriar C.C.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.748
I had Tim Bledsoe

20:07.748 --> 20:10.042
in Introduction
to Accounting Practices.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.669
You can call me Patrick.

20:11.669 --> 20:12.753
It's not Lieutenant Meers
anymore.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.338
I left the Army
last year.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.048
Well, I appreciate
you coming in.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.134
As I mentioned
on the phone,

20:18.134 --> 20:20.970
Tim Bledsoe's body being found,
it's given us reason to go back,

20:20.970 --> 20:22.805
talk to everyone
he had trouble with, Mr....

20:22.805 --> 20:25.516
Godel. Jacob Godel.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.351
And I don't mean
to be adversarial,

20:27.351 --> 20:29.562
I'd just rather not help you.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.980
Why is that?

20:30.980 --> 20:34.400
Uh, because I don't care
if Tim's killer is ever found.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.985
What'd you have against him?

20:35.985 --> 20:39.447
He slapped me
in front of my whole class.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.408
I was expecting, "No, Dr. Veek,
I don't know the difference

20:42.408 --> 20:46.787
between LIFO and FIFO,"
but instead he slapped me.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.832
You know, I was drinking
at a bar with a buddy

20:49.832 --> 20:52.251
and Tim was sitting
a few stools down.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.961
He overheard me say
I was selling my car,

20:53.961 --> 20:55.671
so he asked if
he could see it.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.047
I took him outside
to show it to him

20:57.047 --> 20:59.216
and he picked a fight with me.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.928
He called me gay,
sucker punched me, boom.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.638
I'm a big guy.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.265
He got it worse than I did.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.976
The cops showed up,
I told them to drop it.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.145
Hell, I even went back in
and finished my drink.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.106
He was a demon,
spawn of the Devil.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.026
Maybe you could be
more specific?

21:17.026 --> 21:19.278
He beat me up.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.448
I wanted to press charges,
but his dad's a cop.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.076
I reported the slap.
He was suspended.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.162
End of story.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.623
Yeah, I thought
about revenge sometimes.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.335
But I was on a trip
to Argentina with my folks

21:34.335 --> 21:35.753
when he disappeared.

21:35.753 --> 21:39.715
Hmm. I felt bad for him.
He was troubled.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.467
You know, you could just tell.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.135
A head case.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.137
One of those
trench coat kids, you know?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.555
Him and his friend.

21:46.555 --> 21:47.681
His friend was the one
I figured

21:47.681 --> 21:49.808
would end up in real trouble.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.312
Nobody's mentioned Tim having
any close friends.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.689
Oh, he had one.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.274
They hung out
in the back of my class.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.401
It was creepy as can be.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.239
Dylan... Halleran.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.365
That's his name.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.414
You moved your cot.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.291
I needed somewhere to sit.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.092
You want to talk?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.677
Actually, at the moment,
I've got very little to say

22:24.677 --> 22:27.930
about the murder
of Tim Bledsoe.

22:27.930 --> 22:30.057
Given his behavior,
I think the only mystery

22:30.057 --> 22:32.851
is why he wasn't
killed years ago.

22:32.851 --> 22:33.852
I wasn't talking
about the case,

22:33.852 --> 22:34.895
I was talking about
the captain.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.399
These last few days,
everything happened so fast.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.234
Marcus called,
we packed our things,

22:40.234 --> 22:42.278
we came straight here.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.988
We never even talked about it.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.948
What's to talk about?

22:45.948 --> 22:48.200
You and the captain,
everything that happened

22:48.200 --> 22:49.910
before you left
for London last year.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.204
If memory serves, Watson,

22:52.204 --> 22:54.123
we talked about
the subject ad nauseam

22:54.123 --> 22:55.457
before your own
move to London.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.875
I know, but it's
different now.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.252
How's it different?

22:58.252 --> 23:00.087
Because someone tried
to kill him?

23:00.087 --> 23:03.340
He chose to protect
his daughter over you.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.800
That's not gonna change,

23:04.800 --> 23:06.385
no matter how many
times he gets shot.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.680
You came a very long way
to help him.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.223
It was the right thing to do.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.976
You're risking
a prison sentence.

23:13.976 --> 23:16.478
Does that seem so
out of character?

23:20.232 --> 23:22.359
I got a call from Paige
a little while ago.

23:22.359 --> 23:23.235
He had a rough night.

23:25.613 --> 23:28.532
If he doesn't
show improvement soon...

23:28.532 --> 23:29.992
Then what?

23:29.992 --> 23:30.993
You should go see him.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.414
Call it closure,
call it whatever you want,

23:35.414 --> 23:36.832
but you should say
what you want to say to him

23:36.832 --> 23:38.042
before it's too late.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.668
He's unconscious.

23:43.047 --> 23:45.591
It wouldn't be for him,
it would be for you.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.761
Well, you just said yourself,
I'm wanted by the FBI.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.679
I can't just pop
into a hospital.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.057
He could be in the basement
of the Pentagon.

23:53.057 --> 23:54.892
If you wanted to,
you could find a way

23:54.892 --> 23:56.310
in and out of there,
and no one would be the wiser.
(phone ringing)

24:01.023 --> 24:02.733
Hey, Marcus, what's up?

24:02.733 --> 24:05.903
We got a suspect.
Dylan Halleran.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.196
I don't remember his name
from the case file.

24:07.196 --> 24:08.781
He wasn't in it.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.449
Nobody on that list
looked promising,

24:10.449 --> 24:12.743
but I like him;
he was Tim's only friend.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.536
And you think he killed him?

24:14.536 --> 24:16.538
Let's just say he's capable.

24:16.538 --> 24:19.083
I'm trying to unseal
his juvenile records,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.293
but he's been pretty busy
since he turned 16.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.171
Three arrests.
One included a weapons charge.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.465
He had his dad's .380 on him
when they popped him

24:26.465 --> 24:29.593
for possession of ketamine
and stolen goods.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.470
Surprised he isn't locked up.
He should be,

24:31.470 --> 24:32.930
but he skipped bail.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.516
The judge issued a warrant
for his arrest.

24:35.516 --> 24:36.684
I just sent it to you.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.894
This is great.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.146
It will be if we find him.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.482
Half the NYPD is
beating the bushes.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.359
Good.
I'll join them.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.738
Bro, th-this is not a phone.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.366
Th-This is, like, an MP3 player.
This is trash, man.

24:52.366 --> 24:53.492
What the hell?!

24:53.492 --> 24:56.203
Wait, wait, come back. Ow!

24:56.203 --> 24:58.205
Dylan Halleran, we've
been looking for you.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.498
More like rousting
ketamine dealers

24:59.498 --> 25:01.500
in areas
that your record suggests

25:01.500 --> 25:02.584
you're likely to frequent.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.046
What do you want?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.632
The truth about what happened
to Tim Bledsoe.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.218
I haven't seen him in forever.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.011
What, are you guys looking
for him or something?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.722
We know where he is.
He's in the morgue.

25:14.722 --> 25:18.726
Shot to death with a .380,
just like yours.

25:18.726 --> 25:22.646
Wait, what?
Tim's dead?

25:22.646 --> 25:23.981
Has been for eight months.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.278
I thought he just split
or something,

25:29.278 --> 25:31.488
but he was dead.

25:31.488 --> 25:32.990
You guys think I did it?

25:32.990 --> 25:34.700
When's the last time
you saw him?

25:34.700 --> 25:37.161
About eight months ago.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.580
I, I remember, 'cause it was
right before he stole my car.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.292
I know what you guys
are thinking, okay.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.544
That car theft is
a motive for murder.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.212
Yeah, it was a dick move,

25:47.212 --> 25:48.464
but I wouldn't kill him over it.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.549
Were you questioned recently
by a police captain

25:50.549 --> 25:52.926
by the name of Tom Gregson?

25:52.926 --> 25:54.011
Who?

25:54.011 --> 25:56.346
No.
He was shot Thursday night.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.931
Same caliber gun.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.769
No, no, no, no, no,
I would never--

26:01.769 --> 26:04.605
Wait, did you say Thursday?

26:04.605 --> 26:06.732
Thursday I was dead.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
I OD'd on some bad K.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.985
They said at the hospital
my heart stopped

26:09.985 --> 26:11.320
for, like, a minute.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.907
I kept the bracelet in case
I ever needed to go back.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.950
As for Tim, you know,
I wanted him found

26:16.950 --> 26:20.162
as bad as anyone...
so I could kick his ass.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.039
After he was done
with my car,

26:22.039 --> 26:24.666
he parked it next to a hydrant
in the Bronx.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.627
It took me forever
to save up enough

26:26.627 --> 26:27.961
to get it out of impound.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.880
I just got it back,
like, last week.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.216
So the car was left
virtually undisturbed

26:32.216 --> 26:33.467
since he disappeared.

26:33.467 --> 26:36.261
Yeah. I think so.
Why?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.764
Is it nearby?

26:41.892 --> 26:44.436
Forgive me for
saying this, Dylan,

26:44.436 --> 26:46.188
but you don't strike me
as the sort of gentleman

26:46.188 --> 26:47.856
who summers in Connecticut;
do you know anything about this?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.274
What is it?

26:49.274 --> 26:50.776
It's a ticket
for the Bridgeport Ferry,

26:50.776 --> 26:53.403
dated 23rd of October, 2018.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.031
That's around the same time
that Tim disappeared.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.366
The day after he was last seen.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.660
That would allow him to
stow his vehicle on board

26:59.660 --> 27:01.078
and then cross Long Island Sound
to Port Jefferson.

27:01.078 --> 27:01.912
Was it Tim's?
(alarm chirps)

27:01.912 --> 27:04.206
It's definitely not mine.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.542
Did he say anything
about taking any trips?
Not to me.

27:06.542 --> 27:08.919
Pungent smell.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.296
I know, man, he punked me hard.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.131
What does that mean?
I told you.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.133
He dumped the car
where he knew it'd get towed.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.802
He also filled the trunk
with, like, a million bags

27:16.802 --> 27:18.220
of fertilizer.
I got rid of it,

27:18.220 --> 27:19.221
but I'll never get
rid of that smell.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.978
I don't think your friend
was punking you, Dylan.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.105
WATSON:
Are those blasting caps?

27:28.105 --> 27:31.108
To be used in conjunction with
the fertilizer, I imagine.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.359
I think Tim Bledsoe
was planning on

27:32.359 --> 27:34.820
sinking the Long
Island Ferry,

27:34.820 --> 27:35.821
and a few hundred
people with it.

27:40.409 --> 27:41.535
BELL:
The kid you found in the wall,

27:41.535 --> 27:43.412
he was plotting
a terror attack?

27:43.412 --> 27:45.497
Technically, it's just a theory.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.500
But he had all the materials
for a fertilizer bomb

27:48.500 --> 27:50.252
in the trunk of
a car he stole.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.670
Going by the smell,

27:51.670 --> 27:53.630
I'm pretty sure the lab
is gonna confirm it.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.674
They're gonna find traces
of solid ammonium nitrate

27:55.674 --> 27:57.634
fertilizer in the trunk.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.345
Same stuff that was used
in the Oklahoma City bombing.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.930
He have enough
to sink a ship?

28:01.930 --> 28:03.432
According to Dylan,
the trunk was full of it,

28:03.432 --> 28:05.767
at least 800 pounds.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.561
That's enough to punch a hole
in just about anything.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.939
Well, the ferry makes sense
if Tim was some kind of

28:10.939 --> 28:13.400
aspiring domestic terrorist.

28:13.400 --> 28:16.361
Why else would he drive
from Queens to Connecticut

28:16.361 --> 28:18.614
and then drive all the way back
to Port Jefferson?

28:18.614 --> 28:20.657
I called the ferry.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.451
They're gonna check
exact numbers on ridership,

28:22.451 --> 28:25.412
but best guess,
the ship would have gone down

28:25.412 --> 28:27.205
with 200 people
on board that day.

28:27.205 --> 28:31.251
Instead, Tim Bledsoe gets
shot and stuffed in a wall

28:31.251 --> 28:33.754
one day before all this
is supposed to happen.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.839
I can't imagine
it's a coincidence,

28:35.839 --> 28:37.007
which only leads
to more questions.

28:37.007 --> 28:38.258
Was this Tim's plan?

28:38.258 --> 28:39.593
Was he working
for someone?

28:39.593 --> 28:40.802
Did his accomplice
get cold feet?

28:40.802 --> 28:43.388
Crossed my mind,
the guy who shot him

28:43.388 --> 28:44.890
did the world
a pretty big favor.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.767
But if we're talking
about some hero

28:46.767 --> 28:48.226
who learned what
Tim was up to,

28:48.226 --> 28:49.978
why not call the cops?

28:49.978 --> 28:51.813
Why shoot a cop to
keep it all a secret?

28:51.813 --> 28:53.857
I agree. It doesn't
make any sense.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.776
Someone had to know
Tim's plan.

28:55.776 --> 28:58.779
I got to let the feds
in on all this,

28:58.779 --> 29:00.864
see if he was
on their radar.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.240
I'm guessing you
don't want to join me.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.284
Actually, I want to talk
to Tim's mother again.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.328
She didn't think he was
such a bad kid.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.622
I want to know if she was
lying to me or just herself.

29:11.959 --> 29:15.587
You think Tim wanted
to kill people?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.381
We know it's hard to
hear, but we don't have

29:17.381 --> 29:19.549
a better explanation
for what we found so far.

29:19.549 --> 29:20.759
Can you think of another reason
he would have bought

29:20.759 --> 29:22.886
a ticket
for the Bridgeport Ferry?

29:22.886 --> 29:24.763
Do you have friends or relatives
in Connecticut?

29:24.763 --> 29:27.641
I have no idea why he would've
wanted to drive up there,

29:27.641 --> 29:29.851
but what you're saying...

29:29.851 --> 29:31.395
a-a bomb?

29:31.395 --> 29:32.854
It's not possible.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.356
I would know.

29:34.356 --> 29:37.776
Well, maybe some part of you
did know subconsciously?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.154
You trying to cover for him?

29:41.154 --> 29:43.991
This is ridiculous.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.158
My son was not a bomber.

29:45.158 --> 29:46.827
HOLMES:
Perhaps not.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.412
We're by no means certain
that he acted alone.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.957
Plot like this requires
considerable planning,

29:51.957 --> 29:54.334
sophistication,
and technical expertise.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.795
WATSON: You said that Tim
fell in with the wrong crowd.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.879
Can you think
of anyone in particular

29:57.879 --> 29:59.423
who might have gotten
in his ear?

29:59.423 --> 30:00.424
Anyone who knew
how to build

30:00.424 --> 30:01.466
a fertilizer bomb?

30:04.511 --> 30:05.470
You know something.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.600
No, I don't, but...

30:10.600 --> 30:12.853
but you said "fertilizer."

30:12.853 --> 30:15.272
That's right.
He had a lot of it.

30:15.272 --> 30:17.566
Right before Tim went missing,
about a week, maybe,

30:17.566 --> 30:19.359
I lost my credit card.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.154
Or I thought I did. I-I didn't
want to believe it was Tim.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.406
There were these
weird charges.

30:24.406 --> 30:25.866
I called and complained.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.200
I told the company
they were fraud,

30:27.200 --> 30:28.577
and they canceled them.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.037
But it was Tim.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.790
He bought a lot
of other stuff, too.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.003
But it could just be
a coincidence, right?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.254
I mean,
it-it could've been fraud.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.841
We need to see those charges.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.896
HOLMES: The investigation into
your shooting proceeds apace.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.232
I'm confident we'll find
the person responsible.

31:02.527 --> 31:07.157
Also... hello.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.579
It's my understanding that,
despite your condition,

31:12.579 --> 31:15.749
you might understand some,
if not all, of what I'm saying.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.004
Of course it's more likely
I'm just talking to myself.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.342
What you did to Watson...

31:28.095 --> 31:31.139
You jeopardized everything.
Yeah.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.559
I know

31:34.559 --> 31:36.812
Hannah's your daughter, so...

31:41.108 --> 31:42.943
I would have understood.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.904
I would have helped you.

31:48.406 --> 31:52.452
And-and I want you to know
that I forgive you.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.870
Of course I do.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.379
Should've got yourself shot
a lot sooner,

32:02.379 --> 32:03.547
we could have settled
this all then.

32:06.508 --> 32:08.176
(light clattering)

32:10.512 --> 32:11.972
How much of that did you hear?

32:16.893 --> 32:19.271
I came in at "I forgive you."

32:21.356 --> 32:23.483
How did you get past
the guy in the hall?

32:26.403 --> 32:28.613
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.031
No, I'm glad
you did.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.909
I think he would be, too.

32:35.704 --> 32:39.249
You know, I don't know what went
down between you guys last year,

32:39.249 --> 32:41.793
I mean, not really,

32:41.793 --> 32:45.088
but I know that he missed you.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.506
Every day.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.091
He loves you.

32:48.091 --> 32:51.303
I mean, he can't
say it right now.

32:51.303 --> 32:56.016
Hell, he probably couldn't
say it even if he was awake...

32:56.016 --> 32:58.018
but he does.

33:00.330 --> 33:01.830
Did you get to say
everything you wanted to?

33:06.420 --> 33:09.760
932 bucks. That's all it costs
to build a car bomb, huh?

33:09.760 --> 33:11.680
If you're making it
out of gardening supplies,

33:11.680 --> 33:13.720
but that's not why I wanted you
to see that statement.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.560
Check out the
highlighted charges.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.640
Looks like all the
purchases Tim's mom

33:18.640 --> 33:21.190
flagged as fraud were
at businesses in the Bronx.

33:21.190 --> 33:22.520
See all the little ones
from Natty G's?

33:23.560 --> 33:24.820
So that is a diner

33:24.820 --> 33:27.070
attached to a youth hostel
in Morris Heights.

33:27.070 --> 33:30.990
So you know where Tim
was staying before he died.

33:30.990 --> 33:35.580
Better than that. I have
footage of Tim being abducted.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.910
So it happened
out front,

33:37.910 --> 33:41.960
the night before he was going
to Connecticut to set sail.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.630
Nobody ever saw this?

33:44.630 --> 33:47.250
He was checked in under a fake
name, so nobody knew to look.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.880
But the building
across the street

33:49.880 --> 33:52.130
has an exterior security camera
that caught the whole thing.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.050
Time-stamped 22:34.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.520
BELL:
Okay. There's Tim.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.060
Now there's just
a second at the end,

34:00.060 --> 34:02.350
you get a glimpse of the guy,
but you can see, plain as day,

34:02.350 --> 34:03.600
he's carrying
a gun. There.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.520
That's got to be enough
for facial recognition.

34:07.570 --> 34:11.030
Actually, we won't need it.
I met that bastard yesterday.

34:12.360 --> 34:13.610
(children arguing)

34:13.610 --> 34:14.950
PATRICK:
Hon, I'm heading to the store.

34:14.950 --> 34:17.950
We need anything besides
detergent and lunch meat?

34:17.950 --> 34:19.500
WIFE:
No, I think that's it.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.410
Tessa, let him be
the squirrel this time.

34:34.010 --> 34:36.760
WIFE: Pat, did you
forget something?

34:36.760 --> 34:39.390
All units, be advised,
subject knows we're out here.

34:44.520 --> 34:47.560
He heard us.
They're pretty sure.

34:47.560 --> 34:49.980
He's got six registered guns
and two kids inside.

34:49.980 --> 34:51.940
All right,

34:51.940 --> 34:53.820
tell your men to stand down.
I got to talk to him.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.000
Patrick Meers.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.620
Come out with
your hands up.

35:03.620 --> 35:07.710
We don't want to see anyone
in that house get hurt, Patrick.

35:21.810 --> 35:25.480
All my weapons are on the floor
by the door.

35:25.480 --> 35:28.650
Please, my family's inside.

35:28.650 --> 35:30.070
(grunting)
OFFICER:
Don't move.

35:30.070 --> 35:31.730
OFFICER 2: See if there's
additional weapons.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.730
I don't know if you need me
to sign something,

35:43.730 --> 35:47.610
or if me just saying it's
enough, but I did it.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.530
BELL:
Mr. Meers, to be clear,
you're confessing

35:50.530 --> 35:53.040
to killing
Tim Bledsoe and...
Yeah.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.620
Yeah, I'll tell you everything.
You deserve that at least.

35:57.910 --> 36:00.240
I didn't really want
to shoot that cop,

36:00.240 --> 36:02.960
the captain.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.580
I didn't want to,
but he figured it out.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.420
Let's start at the beginning.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.000
You told me yesterday

36:08.000 --> 36:10.710
Tim Bledsoe was just a stranger
who sucker punched you.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.840
Now we'll get into why
in a minute,

36:12.840 --> 36:14.470
but I'm having
a hard time believing

36:14.470 --> 36:16.010
that's all there was to it.

36:16.010 --> 36:20.310
It was stupid. Okay?
I should've let it drop.

36:20.310 --> 36:22.640
But it just didn't sit right.
You know, this punk jumped me

36:22.640 --> 36:24.390
and he was
gonna skate?

36:24.390 --> 36:25.940
You don't expect us

36:25.940 --> 36:27.860
to believe this was
all over a bar fight?

36:27.860 --> 36:30.020
I thought the cops were gonna
charge him with assault,

36:30.020 --> 36:31.730
but his dad got him off.

36:31.730 --> 36:33.530
It wasn't right.

36:33.530 --> 36:37.870
I guess I... wanted revenge,
you could call it.

36:37.870 --> 36:39.370
BELL:
So this kid,

36:39.370 --> 36:41.120
who you didn't know

36:41.120 --> 36:44.290
until he picked a fight
with you at a bar,

36:44.290 --> 36:46.000
how'd you find him?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.330
The people at the bar,
when I went back,

36:48.330 --> 36:50.290
they knew where he was staying.

36:50.290 --> 36:52.840
I had my gun, so I caught him
when he left his place.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.090
Got him into the car

36:54.090 --> 36:55.380
to have a chat.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.470
I don't even know what
we were gonna talk about,

36:57.470 --> 37:00.510
but we didn't get that far.
He tried to grab my gun.

37:00.510 --> 37:02.430
So you shoot him.

37:02.430 --> 37:04.850
Now you've got a body
to get rid of.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.440
You take him
to the baseball field.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.650
I'm an electrician.

37:08.650 --> 37:10.940
I got a partner, Scott Darnell.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.690
He didn't have anything
to do with this,

37:12.690 --> 37:17.070
but he's how I knew
about the field.

37:17.070 --> 37:19.160
He umps games up there in Queens

37:19.160 --> 37:22.120
and his brother's
the commissioner or whatever.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.200
He was helping 'em
finish the snack bar.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.500
I got it from the league

37:26.500 --> 37:29.290
that field was built
by Hansen Construction.

37:29.290 --> 37:32.960
They just poured the foundation.
Walked off the job.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.630
Scotty was finishing
it pro bono.

37:35.630 --> 37:39.010
We got a picture of the
ribbon-cutting in our office.

37:39.010 --> 37:40.510
That's why we're here now.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.550
That's when the captain
came to see you.

37:42.550 --> 37:44.270
Yeah, he saw the photo

37:44.270 --> 37:47.940
and the date on it,
same week Tim went missing.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.730
He said he was going back
over the case,

37:49.730 --> 37:50.900
talking to everybody
in the file.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.440
He didn't push it,
but I could tell

37:53.440 --> 37:54.690
he saw how nervous I was.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.280
So when he left,
I followed him.

37:57.280 --> 37:58.320
My stomach dropped

37:58.320 --> 37:59.910
when he started going
towards the field.

37:59.910 --> 38:02.280
He was gonna find Tim.
I-I had to stop him.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.120
Tried to, at least.
He fired back.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.830
That's how he got to his car.

38:05.830 --> 38:07.160
By the time I got to mine,
he was gone.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.000
That's the whole story.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.960
For what it's worth,

38:14.960 --> 38:16.670
I'm-I'm really sorry.
You're lying.

38:16.670 --> 38:18.720
What?

38:18.720 --> 38:20.220
There's a couple
of key ingredients

38:20.220 --> 38:22.090
missing from your story.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.600
Uh... I don't know
what you mean.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.140
Yeah, you do.

38:26.140 --> 38:28.390
Tim Bledsoe was gonna blow up
the Bridgeport Ferry

38:28.390 --> 38:29.770
the day after you shot him.

38:29.770 --> 38:32.020
What?

38:32.020 --> 38:35.230
Come clean, man.
How were you involved?

38:35.230 --> 38:36.980
I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:38.530 --> 38:39.820
He was really gonna
blow up a ferry?

38:39.820 --> 38:41.410
You knew he was.

38:41.410 --> 38:43.160
No. You're wrong, okay?

38:43.160 --> 38:44.620
This is the first
I'm hearing about it.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.580
So what now?

38:47.580 --> 38:48.870
Do I get a lawyer?

38:52.860 --> 38:55.070
He's lying.

38:55.070 --> 38:57.300
He is, at the very least,
suppressing a larger truth.

38:57.300 --> 38:59.600
I've been digging
into Mr. Meers.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.980
He is, from all outward
appearances, a Boy Scout.

39:01.980 --> 39:03.790
Served two tours
in Afghanistan

39:03.790 --> 39:05.300
before an honorable discharge.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.340
He has two young children
and an accountant wife

39:07.340 --> 39:09.430
with the world's most banal
social media presence.

39:09.430 --> 39:10.800
Never so much as an
overdue library book,

39:10.800 --> 39:13.300
and the only mention
of him in the news

39:13.300 --> 39:14.850
is an article in which
he chased down

39:14.850 --> 39:16.350
a purse snatcher

39:16.350 --> 39:18.640
who robbed an imam's wife
outside a mosque in Brooklyn.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.140
In other words,

39:20.140 --> 39:22.190
not the bio of a guy
who decides to murder someone

39:22.190 --> 39:23.400
over a month-old bar fight.

39:25.820 --> 39:27.990
You said the case
is all but closed?

39:27.990 --> 39:30.490
It's what the department wants.

39:30.490 --> 39:33.030
He never wavered from his story,
and there's no way to prove

39:33.030 --> 39:36.450
that he knew about Tim Bledsoe's
plan to blow up the ferry,

39:36.450 --> 39:38.120
but he did.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.120
It was written
all over his face.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.040
Perhaps the two of them got
talking that night in the bar.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.960
Tim got so drunk,

39:43.960 --> 39:46.920
he tipped his hand,
Patrick decided to play hero.

39:46.920 --> 39:51.130
A month later? And without
saying a word to the police?

39:51.130 --> 39:53.340
Hmm. Perhaps Tim Bledsoe
is not the lone wolf

39:53.340 --> 39:55.050
that we thought he was.

39:55.050 --> 39:56.970
He's part of a terror cell,
along with Meers.

39:56.970 --> 40:00.480
The group had doubts
about Tim's plan or his loyalty,

40:00.480 --> 40:02.480
and Meers was sent
to dispatch him.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.940
Well, Tim's mental health

40:05.940 --> 40:07.730
obviously wasn't great.

40:07.730 --> 40:09.440
He could've been radicalized.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.940
And Patrick wouldn't be
the first vet

40:10.940 --> 40:13.450
to come back from Afghanistan
with a new and toxic ideology.

40:13.450 --> 40:15.450
If you're right,

40:15.450 --> 40:17.910
there could be plans
for more attacks in New York.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.450
I'll call Marcus
in the morning,

40:19.450 --> 40:21.500
let him know this is something
he should look into.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.290
In the meantime, I'm gonna pack.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.130
You should
do the same.

40:25.130 --> 40:28.380
The car's coming to pick us up
tomorrow at 6:00.

40:28.380 --> 40:32.970
âª Hide all the keys
and seal our windows âª

40:32.970 --> 40:34.390
âª âCause Iâm going to war... âª

40:34.390 --> 40:36.100
HOLMES:
Don't pack.
What?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.180
Don't pack. Stay.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.390
The department might be
through with Meers,

40:40.390 --> 40:41.850
but you and Marcus
don't have to be.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.060
It could be good for you.
You said in London

40:45.060 --> 40:46.980
that you missed it here.
Yeah, but...

40:46.980 --> 40:49.480
Stay. Make sure there's no more
danger, no active terror cell.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.280
What about you?

40:52.530 --> 40:54.530
I could stay, too.

40:54.530 --> 40:58.200
No. No, there's no way.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.080
There's no way I'm gonna
stay here with you

41:00.080 --> 41:01.750
and worry the whole time
that you're gonna get arrested.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.250
Then I'll go.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.330
You can do what you've been
pretending to do

41:07.330 --> 41:09.500
the last few days:
keep me apprised in London,

41:09.500 --> 41:11.630
and I'll help you from there.

41:11.630 --> 41:14.430
Are you sure?

41:14.430 --> 41:18.300
No... but what choice
do we have?

41:20.060 --> 41:23.480
âª Don't hold your breath
waiting for me âª

41:23.480 --> 41:27.440
âª 'Cause I may never come home âª

41:27.440 --> 41:31.190
âª Leave all your bags
and head for the water âª

41:31.190 --> 41:35.150
âª Chase the lies into the sea âª

41:35.150 --> 41:38.410
âª Don't hold your breath
waiting for me âª

41:38.410 --> 41:41.700
âª 'Cause I may never come home âª

41:41.700 --> 41:45.750
âª No, I may never come home âª

41:45.750 --> 41:49.330
âª 'Cause I may never come home âª

41:49.330 --> 41:51.630
âª No, I may never come home âª
âª Don't hold your breath âª

41:51.630 --> 41:53.550
âª Waiting for me âª

41:53.550 --> 41:56.470
âª âCause I may never come home âª

41:56.470 --> 42:00.550
âª No, I may never come home... âª

42:00.550 --> 42:02.220
WOMAN:
Next.

42:04.020 --> 42:06.770
OFFICER:
Sir.

42:06.770 --> 42:08.600
What are you doing?

42:08.600 --> 42:10.860
I'm here to surrender myself.
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.650
I'm wanted for the murder
of Michael Rowan.

42:13.650 --> 42:15.360
âª Waiting for me âª

42:15.360 --> 42:17.240
âª 'Cause I won't ever
come home. âª
