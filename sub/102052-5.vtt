00:18.810 --> 00:21.479
<i>It's easy to fight</i>
when you've never been hurt before.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.150
<i>Until it happens, you're invincible.</i>

00:27.610 --> 00:30.572
<i>But with every fight, there's a risk.</i>

00:30.655 --> 00:32.615
<i>And sometimes, you're sidelined.</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:37.245
<i>The road to recovery is long.</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:41.416
<i>Endless, when it's</i>
not clear <i>if you can recover.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.170
<i>Some days I lose sight of who I am,</i>

00:46.504 --> 00:48.757
<i>but I can't forget what my mission is.</i>

01:12.113 --> 01:14.908
Easy. Easy, Bob.
Higher.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.328
Higher, higher.
Okay, Bobbie.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.674
Watch it. Hey!

02:24.435 --> 02:26.312
<i>I have to keep the hope alive,</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:29.357
<i>that I can still make a difference.</i>

02:34.320 --> 02:35.363
<i>If not,</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:38.700
<i>then what was</i>
coming back from the dead for?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.997
<i>I count the days</i>
and pray to be whole again,

02:45.081 --> 02:47.375
<i>back with my people on</i> Snowpiercer,

02:48.626 --> 02:51.045
<i>1,034 cars long.</i>

03:40.178 --> 03:43.389
He hasn't stopped playing her
since we got back from <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

03:45.266 --> 03:46.559
<i>Snowpiercer...</i>

03:47.310 --> 03:51.606
That was the only best day of my life.

03:52.273 --> 03:55.234
He has lost his mind.
Do you see what he has us reading?

03:56.319 --> 03:59.072
I know. Miss Audrey was so dazzling.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.533
He's pining for her, his great love.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.459
And you've been pining over
the second-to-last Australian.

04:12.835 --> 04:13.962
His name's Murray.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.588
Murray.

04:22.303 --> 04:26.557
Dear readers, lay down your tomes,
and sharpen your <i>bon mots</i> for Book Club.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.686
<i>Yes, you know...</i>
Shit! I haven't finished.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.064
He killed his first wife,
and the house burns down. Let's go.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.485
Hey.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.155
What happened with you and Wilford?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.660
Do you wanna talk about it?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.954
When I worked here, you saved me.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.289
You knew how to save yourself.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.292
Come on, it's me.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.795
The little I do know
about you and Wilford has me worried.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.673
My eyes are wide open.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.551
This is nothing like the last time.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.762
I'll be fine.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.890
Just be careful.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.064
-Dr. Headwood.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.775
Dr. Headwood. Emilia.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.861
Damien, with a nice trim jib.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.697
Alex. Come in, all of you.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.996
Who wants to open
with thoughts on our Rebecca?

05:31.622 --> 05:33.291
You? Yeah?

05:34.709 --> 05:37.378
-You? Yeah?

05:37.462 --> 05:39.005
Don't put your hand up then.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.555
I found her devotion...

05:48.264 --> 05:50.767
-to her husband tragic.
Oh, here we go.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.562
Mmm.
-Her husband sucked, frankly.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.648
-He "sucked"?

05:57.732 --> 06:01.861
This husband from one of the most
enduring works in English literature.

06:04.697 --> 06:09.702
Emilia, what about you?
Uh, do you trust our narrator-heroine?

06:10.745 --> 06:14.791
We know almost nothing about her,
other than she's young and in love.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.545
But we do get into her psyche,
experience how jealous she is of Rebecca.

06:19.629 --> 06:23.299
If she wasn't being honest, I don't think
she would show us her ugly traits.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.467
Yeah.

06:24.550 --> 06:27.386
But that's ignoring
how consumed she is by Rebecca.

06:28.763 --> 06:31.933
If she doesn't trust herself,
then why would we ever trust her?

06:33.684 --> 06:34.852
Excellent point.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.979
Emilia, your rebuttal?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.482
She's a girl in love.

06:39.565 --> 06:44.862
That can make you do crazy things
and act outside of yourself.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.536
I beg your pardon.
Do continue with the salon.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.748
Well, I, uh,
I find the pair of them romantic.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.583
Their love above all else. The--

06:57.667 --> 06:59.252
No, absolutely not!

06:59.335 --> 07:01.838
I find it quite depressing.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.923
Our friend uptrain lit a lantern.

07:04.757 --> 07:05.758
We're a go.

07:07.718 --> 07:08.970
Good work, Sykes.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.015
Now, send this invitation out to Audrey.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.487
It's an invitation to <i>Big Alice.</i>

07:27.196 --> 07:29.782
Oh! Well, lucky you.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.455
A cordial invitation to dine together
as we pass the Forbidden City.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.291
Lhasa, Tibet. We traveled there years ago.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.877
We're asking an awful lot of you.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.796
-You good with this?
-I understand.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.882
We need to protect ourselves.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.550
Only if you can protect yourself.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.386
How do you know he won't
lock the door, keep you there?

07:50.469 --> 07:53.973
Joseph wouldn't hold me
against my will. It's not his way.

07:54.056 --> 07:56.767
And we need this, and I can do it.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.895
At least find out
what's going on over there.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.108
This is the comms panel.
It's only got one screw.

08:05.193 --> 08:09.113
On <i>Big Alice,</i> it's a red box
attached to a wall in his back engine.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.908
There was a flaw
in the prototype, fixed in ours.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.744
You switch these two wires,

08:15.495 --> 08:17.580
we can hear everything he says.

08:17.663 --> 08:21.209
He won't be able to tell
if his comms are turned on or off.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.883
Hey, save some for me.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.177
Plenty where that came from.

08:31.260 --> 08:35.640
It's been quite some time since we had
a patient with this much tissue damage.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.642
Will it heal?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.728
Headwoods, a moment.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.735
It's happening tonight.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.862
That wasn't
what we agreed on.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.795
You're having
a panic attack. Relax.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.089
Name five red things in the room.

09:08.839 --> 09:09.674
What?

09:09.757 --> 09:12.468
Name five red things
in the room. Quick.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.679
Um...

09:15.846 --> 09:17.139
Blood.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.267
Tissue.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.895
-Bucket.
Keep going.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.315
Button.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.652
Book.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.865
Your... your red book.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.870
The trick is just to externalize the pain.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.291
Don't internalize it
or it will paralyze you.

09:45.459 --> 09:46.460
Thank you.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.384
What's Wilford planning for tonight?

09:53.467 --> 09:55.469
The Headwoods don't look too pleased.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.556
Don't. They are not people
you wanna cross.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.983
We have to put you under for
the debridement on your shoulder today.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.651
We have to go deeper.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.368
Our weather balloon number 11
went up this morning.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.079
Well, that's good news,
Mr. De la Torre.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.457
Let us know
when we can announce contact with Melanie.

10:24.540 --> 10:26.834
Her pings do wonders for morale.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.337
Sorry.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.088
Javi, you were saying...

10:31.172 --> 10:34.050
The data has been
shared with Wilford as we agreed.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.052
Results are safe with Melanie.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.429
The science is safe, but we are not.

10:38.512 --> 10:42.391
I need to know which cars
are vulnerable to an outside attack.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.394
There are indications that Wilford's
Coldman might be up to something.

10:45.978 --> 10:46.896
What indications?

10:47.772 --> 10:51.609
Breach cars, anything
with a port might be a weak point, yeah?

10:51.692 --> 10:54.362
Yeah. So, we have 16 breach exits,

10:54.445 --> 10:56.364
all of which
we can secure from outside entry.

10:56.447 --> 11:00.201
If you're worried about attack,
are we still opening the border for trade?

11:00.951 --> 11:02.661
Yeah, trade will continue as usual.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.500
Till, you and Roche stay here.
I need a word.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.804
I have a source over there.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.224
All right.
I think we can guess who that is.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.518
So you're communicating through trade.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.477
She all right?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.604
She's fine, for now.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.774
She's onto something, which is why
we have to keep the border open.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.234
You're all worried about Wilford,

11:33.317 --> 11:35.945
but we've got
our own problems here, at home.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.697
The Breachmen and the Tailies
are at each other's throats.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.826
It's been two weeks
since Lights' fingers were chopped off.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.537
And I still don't have
a suspect, a legitimate suspect.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.498
Look, Till, why don't you take a day?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.501
Get some rest.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.794
He's right. Take a day.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.636
If Mr. Layton wants to keep
Hospitality out of his machinations,

12:00.719 --> 12:02.263
we'll have to keep him out of ours.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.140
Some things are need-to-know, Ruth.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.685
What things? Like Audrey is spying?

12:07.768 --> 12:11.147
He doesn't think that's risky,
putting them two back together?

12:11.230 --> 12:13.524
People need to realize
I wasn't born yesterday.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.236
No, ma'am.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.784
Tristan, you are fired
from the address service.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.369
Thank God.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.497
Um... Give it.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.042
Right, Zarah,
let's see what you've got.

12:32.751 --> 12:35.963
-Me? Now?
-Mmm. Poise under pressure.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.431
-You all right?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.228
Morning sickness.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.898
Why didn't you say so?
You can't do announcements like that.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.071
Good morning, <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

13:02.823 --> 13:09.747
Today, as we climb the Tibetan Plateau,
the temperature outside is -118° C.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.461
The wind
is north-northwest at 30 to 40 knots.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.340
Hospitality would like
to remind you all to be mindful

13:19.423 --> 13:20.841
of the change in elevation today.

13:22.885 --> 13:27.097
<i>For our window watchers,</i>
today, we will be passing Lhasa,

13:27.848 --> 13:30.768
<i>the famous Forbidden City</i>
of what was formerly Tibet.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.816
<i>♪ I was gonna clean my room</i>

13:39.568 --> 13:43.739

<i>♪ Because I got high ♪</i>

13:55.292 --> 13:56.585
Did you hear that?

14:04.051 --> 14:06.011
Mr. Pike.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.931
A simple invite would have worked.

14:09.014 --> 14:14.061
Nothing, including you,
moves through Third without my permission.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.565
-If you ever...

14:17.648 --> 14:19.525
...set foot up here again,

14:20.651 --> 14:21.735
you'll be dead.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.825
-I hate that sound.
-Yeah, I know.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.910
It's when
the staples turn in against the skull.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.371
One more. Ready?

14:34.623 --> 14:36.458
Layton!

14:38.627 --> 14:41.088
My weed trade feeds the Tail, brother.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.215
Is that not part
of the reason you gave it to me?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.134
-Yes, you know it is.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.428
It was LJ, the little psycho.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.889
That kid scares me.
She's your cultivation.

14:52.349 --> 14:53.726
What about Osweiller?

14:53.809 --> 14:56.395
Forget about him. He's a lone wolf.
It's Terence.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.148
It's Terence, my brother.
This can't stand.

14:59.231 --> 15:02.860
It won't. Hey, I will handle this.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.046
When do you and Sykes plan
on telling me what you're cooking uptrain?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.215
Patience, my dear.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.344
What's coming
will be a surprise to everybody.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.346
Fitting for an intimate evening?

15:31.555 --> 15:33.265
-You look fine.
-"Fine"?

15:33.349 --> 15:36.518
A young woman
should have a firm aesthetic opinion,

15:36.602 --> 15:38.938
if not an outright stance, shouldn't she?

15:39.021 --> 15:41.523
Your sexism is showing again, Dubs.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.030
How come you can invite Audrey over,
and I can't go see Lilah Folger?

15:48.113 --> 15:50.157
Because, my dear,

15:50.741 --> 15:52.409
today is about Audrey.

15:57.164 --> 16:04.129
<i>♪ And fade out ♪</i>

16:04.838 --> 16:11.804
<i>♪ Again ♪</i>

16:11.887 --> 16:18.852
<i>♪ And fade out ♪</i>

16:19.687 --> 16:23.315
<i>♪ Again ♪</i>

16:23.399 --> 16:26.026
You worried
she'll take your place, hmm?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.280
I'm worried you're going soft on me.

16:34.660 --> 16:35.995
Right this way, ma'am.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.083
How does Audrey help us take <i>Snowpiercer?</i>

16:43.127 --> 16:47.965
Well, that's where
you watch the mystery unfold, Alexandra.

16:54.430 --> 17:01.395
<i>♪ Immerse your soul ♪</i>

17:02.354 --> 17:07.317
<i>♪ In love ♪</i>

17:18.662 --> 17:20.497
Kind of beneath
you two, ain't it?

17:22.291 --> 17:25.085
Well, at least you're together.
I'll see myself up.

17:31.842 --> 17:33.010
<i>We had an agreement.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:35.471
I get it all.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.222
I can do 60/40 for you.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.643
The Tail needs that trade, Terence.
It feeds them.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.521
-You know I don't give a shit about that.
I know.

17:47.816 --> 17:50.944
It's got all the complaints
against you over the years.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.364
Robbery, drug dealing, extortion.
We threw in some unsolved crimes.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.245
Take the deal, Terence, or I lock you up.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.502
I've been watching your trade back there,

18:07.628 --> 18:08.962
and I noticed something.

18:10.130 --> 18:15.260
That dirty little tyke, Winnie, running
uptrain every time there's a shipment.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.554
So it got me thinking,

18:18.180 --> 18:19.515
who you got over there,

18:19.598 --> 18:23.519
and what will Wilford do to a spy?

18:23.602 --> 18:24.645
Careful, Terence.

18:27.147 --> 18:28.607
I'm always careful.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.073
Bye.

18:41.703 --> 18:42.704
It's Josie?

18:42.788 --> 18:45.249
Josie's how
you're getting information back there?

18:45.332 --> 18:46.333
Who else knows?

18:47.126 --> 18:50.045
A few Tailies,
Roche, and Till. That's it.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.090
But now Terence is holding it
like a grenade to my head.

18:53.715 --> 18:58.220
Hey, happy parents-to-be.
I've been looking forward to this all day.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.354
Aha!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.731
There's your baby.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.150
-That little dot?

19:12.234 --> 19:13.277
Uh-huh.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.780
Your child is
roughly the size of a blueberry.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.616
Blueberry?
Haven't had one of those in a while.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.494
Oh, well, blueberries
are tough without the bees.

19:22.578 --> 19:26.123
But I hear the bees are bouncing back.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.792
Ooh... Maybe in time for the due date.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.837
Well, I'm gonna go
get that printout for you.

19:41.054 --> 19:45.225
If Terence is threatening
to expose Josie, he's threatening us.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.228
He needs to be dealt with, Andre.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.692
I'm not in the Tail anymore, Zarah.
I can't do that.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.280
You could sanction it.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.494
I know you have the person to do it.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.047
About time.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.883
This approach to the Forbidden City
is looking pretty hairy.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.302
Looking forward to seeing it.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.637
Wilford's not here.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.058
I'm glad.

20:26.141 --> 20:29.519
We have a moment, just us women.

20:29.603 --> 20:33.148
You wanted to speak to me?
-Yes. Your mother and I are friends.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.027
Well, her and Joseph are enemies,
so what would that make you?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.447
-Neutral, darling.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.242
He tortures us with your albums all day.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.537
-Are all of those songs really about him?
-Most of 'em.

20:48.246 --> 20:50.582
So you love him.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.543
You love him. That's the deal.

20:53.627 --> 20:57.714
What Joseph and I have
is complicated, to say the least.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.801
But I wouldn't be here
if my connection to him

21:00.884 --> 21:04.346
wasn't deeper
than anything I've felt with anyone else.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.271
Audrey is one of
the most intuitive people I've ever met.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.484
-Welcome aboard, old friend.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.574
Something to add, Alex?

21:41.800 --> 21:44.970
Watching instruments ascend
is like watching water boil.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.472
You're not gonna make it go faster.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.683
36,000 meters and no uplink.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.561
Come on, Melanie. Come on.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.313
-Is it her end, or ours?
39,500, no ping.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.692
I have to level out before it's too late.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.737
Ben, she's probably
just having a telemetry issue.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.946
She'll find it.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.199
She'd never miss an uplink,
unless something is wrong.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.038
We better let the others know.

22:13.957 --> 22:17.252
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.629
Okay, line up
nice and straight. Thank you.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.256
Since Melanie's departure,

22:21.340 --> 22:25.135
the kids have been
talking a lot about the planet's future.

22:25.218 --> 22:30.932
So they created something
to share their hope with the entire train.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.935
Okay. All right.
Time to drop it. Drop it. Hold it up.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.520
Thank you, Melanie.

22:37.564 --> 22:38.440
We love you.

22:38.523 --> 22:41.109
-We love you, Melanie.
Okay. That's enough.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.906
Hmm, more reputation rehabilitation
for Melanie Cavill.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.202
Thank you, children.

22:50.285 --> 22:54.664
Your lovely mural will hang
all week where everyone can see it.

22:58.794 --> 23:02.172
Our launch data checks out,
and our instruments are live.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.508
But Melanie hasn't made contact.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.096
Well, that could be anything, couldn't it?

23:11.473 --> 23:13.892
The problem appears to be on her end.

23:13.975 --> 23:17.187
We have to consider
that something happened to her,

23:18.105 --> 23:20.273
and that we might not hear from her again.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.654
We've launched 11 probes so far.

23:25.737 --> 23:28.740
So with a little luck,
that's enough to build a climate model.

23:28.824 --> 23:29.991
But Melanie...

23:33.078 --> 23:34.788
I know that she's okay.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.957
I can feel her out there every day.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.085
Well,
we turn around for her tomorrow.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.046
So we need to launch
our last probe as scheduled.

23:43.130 --> 23:46.007
-Wilford can't get wind of this.
-Agreed.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.553
We need to keep him on mission,
going back to get Melanie.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.097
And what should we tell the passengers?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.808
They're expecting an announcement.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.940
Melanie's the one thing
keeping us all together.

24:03.066 --> 24:04.693
She did it for seven years.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.653
It still means something.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.698
So then we lie.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.327
A lie for hope.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.465
This new
world order you fought for

24:27.549 --> 24:29.342
isn't all it's cracked up to be, is it?

24:30.177 --> 24:33.221
-It's a free-for-all.
-You'd rather have Wilford?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.974
I'd rather sit back
and see where the chips fall.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.977
Mmm. I can't do that, Oz.
Something about me.

24:44.482 --> 24:47.152
I kind of miss you, Bess. I do.

24:50.530 --> 24:55.535
You hear anything even slightly solid
about the Breachmen attacking that Tailie?

24:55.619 --> 24:56.620
Solid? No.

24:58.914 --> 25:02.083
I mean, they're good for it,
the Wilfordites, organized.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.921
So what? Could be anyone.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.050
See you around, Till.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.222
Compliments of those two assholes.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.270
-To our Great Engineer.
-Hear, hear.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.855
Boki...
-Mmm-hmm?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.149
To our Great Engineer.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.988
Hey.
Listen, that only leads to trouble.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.448
Yeah, I'm hoping.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
Come with me. I've got something for you.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.748
-You wanna spar?
Yeah.

25:42.540 --> 25:45.919
Okay. Not what I was expecting, Pastor.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.673
Just met you in a bar.
I go where I'm least expected.

26:06.481 --> 26:07.941
Is this all you got?

26:08.024 --> 26:09.859
I beat a lot of boys at the Academy.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.528
I don't wanna hurt you.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.742
You hurt a lot of people in your past.

26:17.826 --> 26:20.078
What?
People hurt you.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.331
You don't wanna feel pain,
but it's unavoidable.

26:24.749 --> 26:27.377
Suffering is a part
of the human condition!

26:35.010 --> 26:39.097
You can't get to joy,
to relief, without hurting.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.518
Sometimes yourself, sometimes others.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.636
You all right?

27:20.388 --> 27:22.390
I have Melanie on my mind.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.643
Do you know walking you
through Hospitality,

27:26.186 --> 27:28.313
it has me remembering all sorts of things.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.066
Do you need a moment?

27:33.318 --> 27:34.944
No. Walk with me,

27:35.904 --> 27:39.824
as I compose this announcement of
false hope for the passengers in my head.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.834
You know, I'm not naive, Zarah.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.296
Never was, never will be.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.674
I know that people in power lie.

27:59.719 --> 28:02.305
Even I've done things in teal
that I'm ashamed of.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.685
Well, a white lie
to lift the passengers' spirits

28:07.769 --> 28:09.104
won't be one of them.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.358
You're a leader on this train, Ruth.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.319
Your choices make a difference.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.872
You know, I need them to, Zarah.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.459
I really do.

28:40.260 --> 28:45.181
I remember us climbing the steps
of the Drepung Monastery, right out there.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.392
It's so beautiful
to see it again.

28:48.309 --> 28:51.229
-So sad.
Yes, all gone.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.734
Great cities, religions,
whole schools of thought.

28:56.985 --> 29:00.405
The world out there
doesn't serve a purpose anymore.

29:02.031 --> 29:05.034
Well then, thank goodness I'm with the man

29:05.118 --> 29:07.787
who invented the one thing
that continues to matter.

29:11.416 --> 29:14.586
It's only worth it
if you're back by my side, Audrey.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.007
Then open an aperitif so I can linger.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.218
I'm sure I can find something sweet.

30:03.009 --> 30:03.885
Shit.

30:11.309 --> 30:12.393
It's so beautiful.

30:16.981 --> 30:17.982
Where were we?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.990
Big Alice,
Big Alice, <i>this is</i> Snowpiercer.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.909
Excuse me.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.664
<i>Ben,</i>
is that your nasally voice?

30:33.498 --> 30:36.709
I'm just confirming
we launched balloon 11 today,

30:36.793 --> 30:39.254
and, uh, Melanie linked up as usual.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.548
<i>Riveting stuff, Ben.</i>

30:41.631 --> 30:44.926
<i>I guess that's why Climate Science</i>
never really found an audience.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.313
Hmm...

30:59.107 --> 31:00.733
Shall we see what's for dessert?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.627
I think you get it.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.963
Guess that's why I'm sitting here.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.346
Doesn't really suit you, does it?

31:32.515 --> 31:33.766
It was available.

31:34.392 --> 31:35.852
No, I mean any of it.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.607
Running the train.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.575
There are some things I can't do myself.

31:54.245 --> 31:58.875
The Tail wanted to hang me
for cannibalism, and you vouched for me.

31:58.958 --> 31:59.918
I know.

32:02.211 --> 32:03.755
And I made a vow,

32:05.298 --> 32:08.509
never kill outside of combat again.

32:08.593 --> 32:09.677
To be a...

32:11.387 --> 32:13.640
To be a better man. To...

32:14.432 --> 32:15.725
to have a better heart.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.393
You have.

32:20.938 --> 32:23.608
Except when you ask me
to do something like this.

32:27.070 --> 32:32.367
If Terence is going to try and use Josie
to blackmail me, she isn't safe.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.452
We can't lose our source over there.

32:35.578 --> 32:37.205
And she's our sister, Pike.

32:49.884 --> 32:54.263
Ain't no scribe writing Pike's story
in the history of <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

32:57.642 --> 32:59.727
Tailie stories live longer, brother.

33:18.871 --> 33:21.332
You should keep it up.
-I might.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.293
Hey, that stuff you said earlier,

33:25.586 --> 33:28.256
about humans hurting ourselves and others,

33:29.924 --> 33:30.925
do you believe it?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.051
I do.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.930
-Doesn't seem very Christ-like.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.392
You know the realities
of this train better than anyone.

33:39.976 --> 33:43.354
You've seen what people do
to one another, to themselves.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.774
And it's depressing.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.736
To think that at the end of the world,

33:49.819 --> 33:53.573
we can't just find a way
to be good to one another.

33:54.323 --> 33:56.200
I don't look at it that way.

33:57.076 --> 34:01.330
This train has
gone through a lot recently.

34:02.790 --> 34:05.001
People want guidance, someone to look to.

34:08.796 --> 34:09.922
And that's not Layton?

34:10.006 --> 34:11.966
I know you're close to him,

34:12.842 --> 34:15.803
but it hasn't been
an easy road under his leadership.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.684
<i>You must feel it, too.</i>

34:25.813 --> 34:27.857
<i>The change that's brewing.</i>

34:30.443 --> 34:32.987
<i>A leader can only</i>
compromise himself so many times...

34:34.739 --> 34:37.617
<i>before he loses the faith of his flock.</i>

34:41.913 --> 34:43.581
We need to give him time.

34:44.624 --> 34:45.666
Possibly.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.254
Or... he's the wrong shepherd.

34:53.841 --> 35:00.098
<i>Jeremiah 50:6.</i>

35:02.100 --> 35:04.519
<i>"Our people have been lost sheep."</i>

35:05.394 --> 35:08.106
"Their shepherds have led them astray."

35:15.154 --> 35:17.698
<i>"Turning them away on the mountains."</i>

35:22.745 --> 35:25.373
<i>"From mountain to hill they have gone."</i>

35:30.586 --> 35:33.881
"They have forgotten their fold."

35:57.613 --> 35:58.865
What the hell is this?

35:59.907 --> 36:01.534
I need this to be fair.

36:14.046 --> 36:18.092
You come here to kill me,
and you want it to be fair?

36:19.635 --> 36:20.928
It's a Tail thing.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.640
Osweiller!

36:27.852 --> 36:28.936
He's not here.

36:30.479 --> 36:31.606
They all took a walk.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.571
Wait a minute. Hold on.

36:40.156 --> 36:44.410
Listen, Layton offered 60/40, right?

36:45.203 --> 36:46.787
I can live with that.

36:46.871 --> 36:51.626
And I won't say a thing
about his girl over on <i>Big Alice.</i>

36:51.709 --> 36:54.003
Please, Terence,
I'm giving you this courtesy.

36:55.254 --> 36:59.217
Just do this quickly and quietly,
and no one comes running.

37:10.353 --> 37:12.939
-No!
-I wanted you to do this with honor!

37:13.022 --> 37:15.274
Wait! What are you... Wait!

37:15.358 --> 37:16.359
Do this quietly!

37:34.460 --> 37:36.212
You did the right thing, Andre.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.381
I'm proud of you.

37:39.548 --> 37:40.591
Yeah...

38:03.155 --> 38:04.699
Good evening, Snowpiercer.

38:06.158 --> 38:08.953
Earlier today, high above us,

38:09.036 --> 38:12.623
another of our weather balloons
made contact with Engineer Cavill,

38:13.791 --> 38:15.459
<i>out there on her own,</i>

38:16.043 --> 38:18.754
a lone spark lighting the way forward.

38:21.882 --> 38:25.970
<i>On this train,</i>
none of us are strangers to despair,

38:26.887 --> 38:29.682
<i>so we should</i>
celebrate these victories when they come.

38:30.683 --> 38:35.229
<i>We must hold fast</i>
to our mission, our vision and ourselves.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.565
<i>So...</i>

38:38.774 --> 38:42.778
as we prepare
to turn around and return to her,

38:45.323 --> 38:47.575
let us all say a prayer
for Engineer Cavill,

38:48.659 --> 38:53.622
and our dreams of a life
one day... beyond <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

39:30.409 --> 39:33.621
All right.
Down the hatch with these we go.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.583
-How long does the procedure take?
Roughly an hour.

39:44.423 --> 39:47.343
Oh, I gotta jot this down before I forget.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.192
There we are.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.361
Nighty-night.

40:12.910 --> 40:17.540
That Sykes,
she only brings bad news these days.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.292
I did not
appreciate her visit today.

40:26.465 --> 40:27.466
<i>Blood.</i>

40:28.259 --> 40:29.176
<i>Tissue.</i>

40:30.052 --> 40:30.928
<i>Bucket.</i>

40:32.054 --> 40:33.097
<i>Stairs.</i>

40:34.140 --> 40:35.057
<i>Lights.</i>

40:36.725 --> 40:38.853
Wilford pushes and pushes.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.354
He won't lose.

40:44.733 --> 40:45.860
Did she move?

40:46.735 --> 40:48.279
I didn't notice.

40:48.362 --> 40:49.363
<i>Blinds.</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:51.240
<i>Button.</i>

40:52.241 --> 40:56.662
<i>Blood. Blood. Blood.</i>

40:57.913 --> 40:59.415
It's starting tonight.

40:59.498 --> 41:03.294
Mmm, the Breachmen.
He's using them so early.

41:04.003 --> 41:07.798
It's a shame.
We could lose some good subjects too soon.

41:07.882 --> 41:08.716
Uh-huh.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.021
I saw you ditch your meds.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.900
You weren't knocked out
during that procedure, were you?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.860
Don't know what you're talking about.

41:34.700 --> 41:35.910
Give them to me.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.502
Are you gonna tell them?

41:56.889 --> 41:58.599
I hope you know what you're doing.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.692
Border's closing soon.
You don't have to go.

42:09.818 --> 42:11.111
Stay with me.

42:12.112 --> 42:13.822
I'm not the same person anymore.

42:13.906 --> 42:16.116
You are.
You are the same person.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.369
You're not hearing me.

42:18.452 --> 42:20.079
I won't be broken by you.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.667
And if we're gonna do this,
you need to let me break you.

42:26.293 --> 42:29.547
I don't think that's possible.
Too much ice under the surface.

42:29.630 --> 42:33.008
So if you won't let me in, and you
can't change for the good of the train,

42:33.092 --> 42:36.136
then... what am I doing here?

42:36.720 --> 42:37.638
Audrey...

42:38.889 --> 42:40.891
You know me better than anyone.

42:40.975 --> 42:42.601
And you know Mr. Layton.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.687
Who do you think will come out on top?

42:45.604 --> 42:46.522
Joseph,

42:47.690 --> 42:48.774
what are you planning?

42:48.857 --> 42:52.361
I want you by my side
when I take her back.

42:53.028 --> 42:55.072
Stay. Stay with me.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.662
You won't admit it to yourself,

43:01.745 --> 43:03.914
but you're only half alive without me.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.165
It's the same for me.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.459
Together we're electric,

43:07.543 --> 43:09.253
-every nerve on fire...

43:13.591 --> 43:14.842
Stay with me, Audrey.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.972
This one's here, boss.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.517
Clear the path. Thank you.

43:25.644 --> 43:28.022
Make way.
Free trade coming through.

43:31.233 --> 43:34.153
All right, out of the way.
Tony, get your hands off it. Get away.

43:36.196 --> 43:39.116
Well, that's almost all of it.
Still no Audrey.

43:39.199 --> 43:41.201
Call Roche,
tell him to meet me at Muscle Breach.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.411
Why? What's going on?

43:42.494 --> 43:45.456
Just finish up trade,
get Audrey back, close the door ASAP.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.556
Hey! Step away from there, Boki!

44:02.640 --> 44:04.266
Get off of me! You crazy?

44:04.350 --> 44:06.226
-Where are your friends?
-Around.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.479
Where are they?
We know you're plotting for Wilford.

44:08.562 --> 44:10.105
What the hell are you talking about?

44:59.113 --> 45:00.489
No, no, no.

45:12.668 --> 45:14.211
Ms. Wardell!
Audrey!

45:14.294 --> 45:15.963
What on earth is going on over there?

45:16.547 --> 45:18.674
I'm afraid
I'm not quite sure, Mr. Wilford.

45:19.341 --> 45:20.759
What have you done, Joseph?

45:22.803 --> 45:24.138
The choice is still yours.

45:26.098 --> 45:29.518
How about you, Ruth?
I know you've been dying to visit.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.312
Step over before the doors close.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.108
I can't do that now, sir.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.776
Audrey?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.038
Audrey? Audrey!

45:50.122 --> 45:53.041
Good night, Ruth.
I do hope everything is all right.
