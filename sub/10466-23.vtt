THAT THERE ARE 4 GIRLS
IN THE RENTAL ALREADY,

00:09.792 --> 00:11.837
OR IS THAT LIKE,
"CALLING ALL HOUND DOGS,

00:11.837 --> 00:13.622
COME IN PLEASE,
HOUND DOGS"?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.711

ALL SUMMER TOGETHER,

00:45.088 --> 00:48.439
SO...SOMEBODY NORMAL,
YOU KNOW, FRIENDLY,
RESPONSIBLE,

00:48.439 --> 00:51.442

IF HE'S EASY TO LOOK AT.

00:51.442 --> 00:53.749
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
'CAUSE MERCY DIDN'T
WRITE IT ON THE ORDER,

00:53.749 --> 00:55.359
BUT I PUT YOUR DRESSING

00:55.359 --> 00:57.709

01:19.340 --> 01:20.558
SO HE'S IN SCHOOL?

01:20.558 --> 01:22.125
WELL, THAT MEANS HE
GETS A SUMMER VACATION,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.127

CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

28:08.687 --> 28:11.124
SURE.
I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

28:11.124 --> 28:12.473
ARE YOU AN ARTIST?

28:14.910 --> 28:16.695

FOR BEING PERSISTENT.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.174
I CAN'T HEAR
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

28:18.174 --> 28:21.308
SOMETHING LIKE...
"DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU

28:21.308 --> 28:23.484
"YOU HAVE THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL EYES?

ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

28:30.230 --> 28:32.580
WHO ALWAYS THINK
THINGS ARE GONNA
WORK OUT FOR THE BEST?

28:32.580 --> 28:33.842
MMM, NO.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.061
THAT'S AN OPTIMIST.

28:35.061 --> 28:36.062
BINGO.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.019
THAT'S NOT A JOB.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.542
IT IS WHERE I'M FROM.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.979
OH, YEAH?

28:57.779 --> 28:59.694

28:59.694 --> 29:02.784
YOU SHOW ME TOWN
BEFORE I RETURN
TO FINLAND

HOW DID YOU GET--
CLAUDIA LET ME IN.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.077
FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T NEED SOMEBODY
SPYING ON ME

29:35.077 --> 29:36.600
OR--OR FOLLOWING ME
AROUND,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.733
BECAUSE IF I WANTED THAT,
I COULD MOVE BACK IN
WITH MY PARENTS,

29:38.733 --> 29:41.257
WHICH I WOULD RATHER
KILL MYSELF FIRST
THAN DO.

29:41.257 --> 29:42.519
OK, I UNDERSTAND--

29:42.519 --> 29:44.652
AND, YEAH, YEAH,
I APPRECIATE

29:44.652 --> 29:46.785
YOU STICKING UP FOR ME
ONCE YOU GOT THERE
THE OTHER NIGHT,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.003
EVEN THOUGH YOU
SHOULD HAVE NEVER

29:48.003 --> 29:49.309
BEEN THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

29:49.309 --> 29:52.138
BECAUSE I'M NOT
COMPLETELY UNGRATEFUL.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.182
BUT THAT IS NOT
MY POINT.

29:53.182 --> 29:55.532
OK.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.144
THERE ARE
A LOT OF THINGS

29:58.144 --> 30:00.537
THAT I COULD SAY
ABOUT YOU, TOO, CHARLIE.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.104
IT SOMEONE ASKED ME
TO MAKE A LIST,

30:02.104 --> 30:05.064
IF WOULD BE
A GOOD, LONG LIST.

30:05.064 --> 30:07.022
FOR EXAMPLE,

30:07.022 --> 30:08.676
YEAH, I MAY STRIP,

30:08.676 --> 30:11.070
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO,
OK?

30:11.070 --> 30:13.899
FOR THE LAST 2 MONTHS,
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
A THING.

30:13.899 --> 30:15.857
AND DO I SAY ANYTHING?
NO. IT'S COOL.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.511
YOU WANT TO TAKE THINGS
AS THEY COME,

30:17.511 --> 30:19.600
THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS.
IT IS NOT MINE.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.036
RIGHT. THAT'S TRUE,
BUT--

30:21.036 --> 30:22.777

IT WORKS FOR US,
CHARLIE.

30:22.777 --> 30:24.083
THAT IS WHY
IT WORKS FOR US.

WE DO NOT
TELL EACH OTHER
WHAT TO DO.

30:26.302 --> 30:29.131
WE DO NOT CHANGE
OUR LIVES AROUND

AND HE MOVED IT
TO OAKLAND

HOW YOU, UH,

40:40.394 --> 40:41.787
PUSHED HER
TO MOVE UP AT WORK,

40:41.787 --> 40:44.833
AND HOW YOU'RE
TAKING CARE OF NAT.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.183

OF WHAT THAT IS--

41:05.463 --> 41:07.073
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.511
YOU THINK IT'S YOU,

41:10.511 --> 41:12.121

THAT I'M GONNA DO?

41:29.008 --> 41:30.923
DO YOU THINK I'M JUST
GONNA STEP ASIDE?

41:30.923 --> 41:33.316
WE'RE MARRIED, BAILEY.

YOU DID TO HER?

41:49.289 --> 41:51.465

41:52.771 --> 41:54.120
I MESSED UP
VERY BADLY.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.122
BUT I NEVER STOPPED
BEING MARRIED TO HER.

41:56.122 --> 41:57.123

STOPPING NOW,

41:58.080 --> 41:59.865

TELLS ME OTHERWISE.

41:59.865 --> 42:03.782
