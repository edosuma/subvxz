WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.476
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.576 --> 00:11.112
I KEEP TELLING YOU, A LIAR
SHOULDN'T EXPECT THEIR WORD

00:11.212 --> 00:12.913
- TO BE WORTH ANYTHING.
- I AM GONNA START

00:13.013 --> 00:14.682
SOME REAL LYING
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.017
YOU SAID THAT WHEN YOU
SAW JAKE FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:17.118 --> 00:19.387
YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS SEXY AS HELL.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.190
- HE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
- AMY HAS A STRONG NEED
TO HAVE A CAREER.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.292
THAT SEEMS
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.527
THAT IN TURN
MAKES AMY SECRETIVE

00:26.627 --> 00:28.028
AND SHE LIES.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.364
- STOP CALLING ME A LIAR.
- WELL, IF YOU STOP LYING,

00:30.464 --> 00:32.366
I'LL STOP CALLING YOU THAT.
YOU'RE A LIAR,

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU?
YOU ARE A FUCKING LIAR.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.003
- GOD DAMN IT! STOP IT!
- YOU ARE A FUCKING LIAR.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.805
- AMY.
- ( beeps )

00:37.905 --> 00:40.141
Amy's voice:
You're a quitter, okay.
He's a winner.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.543
If you had a quarter
of the strength that Ben has,

00:42.643 --> 00:44.778
- I'd be interested
in you, too.
- YOU PSYCHOPATH.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.516
HAVE YOU EVER
RECORDED YOUR ARGUMENTS
WITH HER BEFORE?

00:48.616 --> 00:52.753
YEAH. I JUST WANT
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO US.

01:01.262 --> 01:03.797
( breathing heavily )
HEY.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.368
WHAT'S UP?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.104
YOU FALL ASLEEP?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.609
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN HERE?

01:15.709 --> 01:19.180
FIVE MINUTES.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.115
SHOULD WE GO IN?

01:21.215 --> 01:23.083
THERE'S SOMEONE IN THERE.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.788
CAN I SIT?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.964
WHAT TIME IS IT?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.732
FIVE TO.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.307
WELL...

01:47.508 --> 01:51.412
WELL, WHAT?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.648
ARE YOU GONNA BE
LIKE THIS IN THERE TOO?

01:57.251 --> 01:59.119
LIKE WHAT?

02:01.622 --> 02:02.723
I DON'T KNOW.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.238
( theme music playing )

02:40.428 --> 02:42.396
Paul:
SO HOW ARE YOU BOTH?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.432
FINE.

02:44.532 --> 02:45.699
FANTASTIC.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.303
BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WANT
TO TALK ABOUT LAST WEEK.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.039
I CAN TOLERATE YELLING
AND OUTBURSTS THAT RESULT

02:52.139 --> 02:55.709
FROM YOUR ARGUMENTS
BUT I WILL NOT,
ABSOLUTELY NOT,

02:55.809 --> 02:58.512
TOLERATE ANY PHYSICAL VIOLENCE.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

02:58.612 --> 03:01.815
IT'S OKAY, PAUL.
WE SEPARATED A WEEK AGO.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.719
SEPARATED.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.255
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.757
SO IT'S A LITTLE LATE
TO START SETTING UP
GROUND RULES.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.859
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T MAKE
YOU FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.395
WHICH IS WHAT
YOU WOULD WANT,
I SUPPOSE, JAKE.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.597
WHY WOULD I WASTE
MY TIME MAKING YOU
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.567
- BECAUSE IT
MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD.
- WAIT, DID YOU HEAR

03:19.667 --> 03:21.702
- WHAT I JUST SAID?
- YES, I DID, AMY.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.072
YOU SAID THAT YOU'D BEEN
SEPARATED FOR A WEEK.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.740
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TELL ME WHY?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.776
HE THREATENED TO KILL ME.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.281
YOU'RE SMILING.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.018
YOU'RE TAKING
ON A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.620
AND WHAT
RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.655
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE NOT CONCERNED.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.524
DO YOU NOT THINK HE'S CAPABLE
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

03:43.624 --> 03:45.493
I THINK HE COULD BE
PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF IT.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.661
- THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
- I'VE HAD PATIENTS

03:47.761 --> 03:49.630
OVER THE YEARS WHO'VE
HAD THEIR LIVES THREATENED.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.467
YOU JUST BROUGHT THIS UP
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.102
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M NOT INTO THIS.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.804
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- Amy: CAN'T YOU HEAR

03:56.904 --> 03:58.506
HOW HE'S TALKING TO US?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.674
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU, PAUL?

04:02.676 --> 04:04.278
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO HOSTILE?

04:04.378 --> 04:05.713
IS THAT WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE TO YOU?

04:05.813 --> 04:07.748
- YES, IT DOES,
VERY MUCH SO.
- OKAY.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.683
Amy:
WHAT?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.320
SEE, I HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH YOU BOTH BEING HOSTILE

04:12.420 --> 04:14.622
TO EACH OTHER
AND TO ME CONSTANTLY.

04:14.722 --> 04:18.158
- WELL, THAT'S WHY WE PAY YOU.
- MONEY'S NOT REALLY THAT
IMPORTANT TO ME, JAKE.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.927
I HAVE OTHER PATIENTS.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.633
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

04:25.733 --> 04:27.501
THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO TREAT US ANYMORE?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.503
DO I WANT
TO TREAT YOU?

04:29.603 --> 04:32.306
HMM, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE,
ACTUALLY.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.345
THIS IS WHAT THERAPY
WOULD BE LIKE

04:37.445 --> 04:40.581
IF NOBODY RESPECTED BOUNDARIES.
IT IS CHAOTIC,

04:40.681 --> 04:43.384
IT IS DISRESPECTFUL
AND IT'S UNPRODUCTIVE.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.787
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

04:52.760 --> 04:53.961
NO.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.903
CAN'T EVEN GET
COUPLES THERAPY RIGHT.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.606
OUR OWN THERAPIST DOESN'T
WANT TO TREAT US ANYMORE.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.016
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THE SESSION

05:16.116 --> 05:18.686
LAST WEEK, AMY?

05:18.786 --> 05:21.989
I TOOK LENNY
AND WENT TO MY MOTHER'S,

05:22.089 --> 05:24.758
AND THEN JAKE SHOWED UP
ON SATURDAY AND WANTED
TO TAKE LENNY HOME.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.293
BEFORE THEY POISONED HIM
WITH SUGAR.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.028
- OH PLEASE.
- Jake: YOU SHOULD SEE

05:28.128 --> 05:30.631
- THE CRAP
THEY FORCE-FEED HIM.
- Amy: I DON'T DO THAT.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.900
ANYWAY, WE WENT
TO THE BEDROOM TO TALK,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.537
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER
AND WE ENDED UP HAVING SEX.

05:36.637 --> 05:40.474
HOW DID ONE THING
AND ANOTHER LEAD TO THE SEX?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.411
WHAT, YOU WANT
SOME DETAILS, BRO?

05:43.511 --> 05:44.845
WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL ME.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.414
THINGS THAT DULL
AT HOME?

05:46.514 --> 05:48.348
I'M INTERESTED
IN YOUR SEX

05:48.449 --> 05:52.085
BECAUSE IT'S PART
OF YOUR DIALOGUE
AS A COUPLE.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.389
SO HOW DID IT GO FROM SEX
TO A MURDER THREAT?

05:57.124 --> 05:59.126
HE HAD JUST
FINISHED COMING.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.429
HE WAS STILL LYING
ON TOP OF ME.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.996
HE WAS STILL INSIDE ME,

06:03.096 --> 06:04.432
AND HE WHISPERED
IN MY EAR

06:04.532 --> 06:06.767
THAT IF I LEFT HIM,
HE'D KILL ME.

06:12.706 --> 06:16.109
HE DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
PULLING OUT.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.612
I WAS DISGUSTED.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.882
HMM, THAT'S
AN UNUSUAL REACTION

06:21.982 --> 06:24.284
TO SOMEBODY THREATENING
TO KILL YOU.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.386
WHAT WAS IT
THAT DISGUSTED YOU?

06:26.487 --> 06:28.155
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT DISGUSTS ME, OKAY?

06:28.255 --> 06:29.657
WATCHING HER
AND HER MOTHER

06:29.757 --> 06:31.592
SHOVE JUNK FOOD
DOWN MY SON'S THROAT.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.895
IT'S A MIRACLE THE KID
DOESN'T SHIT TWINKIES.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
WHAT DOES LENNY
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS?

06:36.964 --> 06:39.166
NOTHING, IT JUST DISGUSTS ME
WHAT YOU DO TO HIM.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.568
HE'S NINE YEARS OLD,
HE WEIGHS 100 LBS.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.303
HE DOESN'T WEIGH
100 LBS.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.074
SO, IS LENNY OVERWEIGHT?

06:47.174 --> 06:50.077
HE'S A CHILD.
HE'LL GROW OUT OF IT
WHEN HE HITS PUBERTY.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.580
I WAS THE SAME.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.215
YOU-- YOU WERE
OVERWEIGHT?

06:55.315 --> 06:58.686
YES, MY DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.455
SHE HAD ISSUES
WITH FOOD.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.256
I WAS THIN BY THE TIME
WE GOT MARRIED.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.625
WHO CARES WHAT I WEIGHED
WHEN I WAS FIVE?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.627
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
THAT BEFORE.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.762
WE NEVER SPOKE ABOUT IT
BECAUSE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT

07:08.862 --> 07:10.898
IN THIS CONTEXT.
THIS IS COUPLES
THERAPY, RIGHT?

07:10.998 --> 07:16.670
- WHEN DID YOU LOSE THE WEIGHT?
- IN MY TEENS. JUST MELTED OFF.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.339
SO DOES IT BOTHER YOU
THAT LENNY IS OVERWEIGHT?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.475
PLEASE STOP SAYING
THAT HE'S OVERWEIGHT.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.946
I DON'T LIKE REFERRING
TO HIM THAT WAY.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.749
- HE HAS A LITTLE BABY FAT
AND HE'LL LOSE IT.
- 30 LBS OF BABY FAT.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.118
HER MOTHER LETS HIM
EAT CANDY, DRINK SODA
AND PLAY XBOX ALL DAY.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.821
IF JAKE HAD HIS WAY,
HE'D NEVER SEE
HIS GRANDMOTHER.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.623
HE'D BE BETTER OFF
ON THE STREETS.
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S GOT

07:35.723 --> 07:37.725
- THE GENES OF AN ATHLETE.
- I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.727
IT'S MY FAULT THAT LENNY'S FAT.
I PASSED DOWN SHITTY GENES.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.629
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT LENNY
WITHOUT ME BEING BLAMED

07:41.729 --> 07:44.064
FOR THE TERRIBLE
GENES I GAVE HIM.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.469
SO THE FACT THAT
YOU WERE OVERWEIGHT,

07:49.570 --> 07:51.805
THAT DOES COME UP
IN ARGUMENTS BETWEEN YOU?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.112
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A RELEVANT SUBJECT
FOR THERAPY?

07:59.212 --> 08:02.516
NO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE'RE GOING IN THIS DIRECTION.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.752
YES, HE WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT OUR FAT LITTLE BOY.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.821
WHY DON'T WE TALK
ABOUT HOW JAKE'S
SCREWING LENNY UP?

08:09.757 --> 08:11.759
SHE MEANS I'M SCREWING
HIM UP SOCIALLY.

08:11.859 --> 08:16.363
- LENNY HITS.
- BECAUSE HE GETS
LAUGHED AT FOR BEING FAT.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.566
NO, LENNY HITS BECAUSE
JAKE TEACHES HIM TO HIT.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.167
HE GETS BULLIED
AT SCHOOL, SO I TAUGHT HIM

08:20.267 --> 08:22.269
TO DEFEND HIMSELF, PAUL.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.672
BESIDES, WEREN'T YOU THE ONE
DOING THE HITTING LAST WEEK?

08:24.772 --> 08:27.074
YOU GOT PAUL CONVINCED
IT'S GONNA ESCALATE TO MURDER.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.776
YOU'RE THE ONE PLANNING
TO KILL ME, REMEMBER?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.278
I WOULD, GLADLY,
BUT I WOULD FEEL BAD FOR PAUL.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.980
WE ALREADY RUINED
HIS COUCH ONCE.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.515
RIGHT.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.355
CAN YOU SEE
THE PATTERN HERE?

08:42.455 --> 08:44.592
WHAT YOU DO
TO EACH OTHER?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.694
YOU TAKE THE MOST
SENSITIVE SUBJECTS,

08:46.794 --> 08:48.762
YOU JUST TOSS THEM
AWAY CARELESSLY.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.799
SOMETIMES YOU LAUGH,
SOMETIMES IT HURTS YOU.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.867
BUT DON'T YOU
FEEL THAT IT MAKES IT
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

08:53.967 --> 08:56.770
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF YOUR REAL FEELINGS?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.506
YOU THINK I FIND IT FUNNY
THAT HE'S THREATENING ME?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.541
Paul: JAKE...

09:01.642 --> 09:03.811
DO YOU MEAN IT
WHEN YOU SAY THESE THINGS?

09:03.911 --> 09:06.279
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU GONNA CALL THE POLICE
OR SOMETHING?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.849
POSSIBLY.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.550
AREN'T THERE LAWS
AGAINST THAT?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.552
AGAINST THREATENING
TO TAKE SOMEBODY'S LIFE?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
NO, LAWS AGAINST
TELLING OTHER PEOPLE

09:14.722 --> 09:16.023
WHAT YOUR PATIENTS
TELL YOU.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.559
THEY DON'T APPLY
TO SERIOUS CRIMES.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.829
JUST LETTING YOU KNOW.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.036
BUT AT LEAST YOU ARE
CALLING YOURSELF A PATIENT.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.972
- THAT'S PROGRESS, JAKE.
- Jake: SO FUCKING
CONDESCENDING.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.440
YOU REALLY ARE.

09:33.540 --> 09:34.975
SOMEBODY SHOULD
TEACH YOU A LESSON.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.977
WHAT IS THAT, ANOTHER THREAT?
SO MANY THREATS FLYING

09:37.077 --> 09:40.113
AROUND THE PLACE,
I'M HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING UP.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.349
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU TODAY, PAUL?

09:42.449 --> 09:43.984
I'M TRYING TO GET
YOU GUYS TO LISTEN,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.720
REALLY LISTEN,
TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.923
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
HAS JAKE THREATENED YOU
BEFORE, PHYSICALLY?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.125
NO.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.329
I DIDN'T REALLY MEAN
I'D KILL HER, OKAY?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.866
- IT JUST CAME OUT.
- HOW DID YOU PUT IT, EXACTLY?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.769
HE SAID, "IF YOU LEAVE ME,
I'LL KILL YOU."

10:01.869 --> 10:03.771
- DID YOU MEAN THAT?
- OF COURSE NOT.

10:03.871 --> 10:07.107
I'M NOT GONNA
FUCKING KILL HER.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.310
THIS WEEK.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.544
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.014
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.416
HMM?

10:16.516 --> 10:18.251
AND YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T AFRAID, AMY,

10:18.351 --> 10:19.552
BUT YOU FELT DISGUSTED.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.321
- YES.
- Paul: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,

10:21.421 --> 10:22.823
"DISGUSTED"?

10:22.923 --> 10:25.458
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PAUL?
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.894
HE'D JUST COME INSIDE ME

10:26.994 --> 10:28.662
AND THEN SAID THAT
HE WANTED TO KILL ME.

10:28.762 --> 10:32.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK
DISGUSTED ME ABOUT THAT?

10:32.900 --> 10:36.569
JAKE, DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE SEVERITY OF WHAT YOU SAID,

10:36.670 --> 10:39.139
THAT THREAT?
YOU REALIZE SHE COULD GET

10:39.239 --> 10:41.675
A RESTRAINING ORDER
AGAINST YOU, DON'T YOU?

10:44.477 --> 10:47.247
I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.051
OKAY.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.023
"IF YOU LEAVE ME,
I'LL KILL YOU."

10:57.524 --> 10:59.827
WE'VE BEEN CONCENTRATING
ON THE SECOND PART
OF THAT SENTENCE,

10:59.927 --> 11:01.762
BUT LET'S LOOK
AT THE FIRST PART OF IT.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.897
"IF YOU LEAVE ME."

11:05.799 --> 11:08.235
THAT SAYS TO ME
THAT YOU'RE AFRAID.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.739
YOU'RE AFRAID
OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO YOU IF AMY LEAVES.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.342
THE FEAR THAT
YOU WOULD CEASE
TO EXIST MAYBE.

11:15.442 --> 11:19.046
THAT YOU... WOULD DIE.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.327
OKAY, LET'S JUST
LEAVE THAT FOR A MOMENT.

11:34.427 --> 11:38.065
I'D LIKE TO GO
BACK TO SOMETHING THAT
WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ON.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.601
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR MEMORIES
OF BEING A CHILD?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.737
BEING OVERWEIGHT?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.139
I DON'T THINK
ABOUT THAT.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.641
I LIVE MY LIFE
MOVING FORWARD.

11:48.742 --> 11:52.379
AND DOES THAT NEED
TO BE ANALYZED, PAUL?

11:52.479 --> 11:56.249
WOULD YOU SAY
THAT YOU WERE
A CONFIDENT CHILD?

11:56.349 --> 11:59.686
NO, NOT REALLY.
I WOULD SAY I WAS
OVERWEIGHT AND SHY

11:59.787 --> 12:01.554
BUT I GREW OUT OF IT
AND I'M FINE.

12:01.654 --> 12:04.091
ACTUALLY, I'M MORE THAN FINE,
AND LENNY WILL BE FINE TOO.

12:04.191 --> 12:08.361
LAST WEEK YOU SAID
JAKE AND HIS FRIENDS
WERE PATHETIC.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.297
YES, THEY ARE THAT.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.532
MAYBE IT'S CONVENIENT
FOR YOU TO THINK

12:12.632 --> 12:15.735
OF JAKE AS BEING PATHETIC,
AS YOU SAY,

12:15.836 --> 12:18.138
BEING AN UNDERACHIEVER.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.773
WHY?

12:19.873 --> 12:23.743
PERHAPS BECAUSE
IT HELPS YOU AVOID SEEING
YOUR OWN INSECURITIES.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.649
I THINK THAT WHEN
HE THREATENED YOU IN BED,

12:29.749 --> 12:32.019
HE REVEALED HOW DESPERATELY
HE NEEDED YOU,

12:32.119 --> 12:33.987
ALTHOUGH HE DID IT
IN A VERY SCARY WAY.

12:34.087 --> 12:37.224
BUT THAT WAS JAKE
AT HIS MOST VULNERABLE...

12:37.324 --> 12:40.327
WHICH I THINK YOU ASSOCIATE
WITH HIM BEING PATHETIC.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.099
AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.972
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I'M WITH AN UNDERACHIEVER

12:52.072 --> 12:53.907
BECAUSE I LACK
SELF-ESTEEM?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.643
WELL, PERHAPS THAT'S A WAY
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

12:56.743 --> 12:58.979
WITH NEGATIVE FEELINGS
ABOUT YOURSELF.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.881
NO!

13:05.585 --> 13:07.921
I WANT A DIVORCE.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.224
HUH.

13:55.635 --> 13:59.006
FINE. I'M TAKING
LENNY WITH ME.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.912
YOU THINK I'M JUST
GONNA LET HIM
GO WITH YOU

14:05.012 --> 14:07.014
SO YOU CAN
TURN HIM INTO SOME
FAT-ASS COUCH POTATO

14:07.114 --> 14:08.281
BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO MAKE A CHANGE?

14:08.381 --> 14:10.683
I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE A CHANGE.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.519
I WANT MY LIFE.

14:12.619 --> 14:16.023
- AND LENNY NEEDS ME.
HE SHOULD BE WITH ME.
- HE NEEDS ME TOO.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.194
FUCK, AMY, WHAT DO
YOU WANT FROM ME, HUH?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.596
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.072
NOTHING.

14:32.172 --> 14:35.208
LET'S JUST TRY
AND DO THIS NICELY,
JAKE, PLEASE.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.278
WHAT THE FUCK'S
SO NICE ABOUT IT?

14:41.915 --> 14:43.650
( thuds )

15:31.164 --> 15:33.500
I, UM-- I HAPPEN
TO KNOW THIS COUPLE

15:33.600 --> 15:37.070
WHO WENT TO THERAPY
AFTER THEY'D ALREADY DECIDED

15:37.170 --> 15:40.340
TO-- TO GET DIVORCED,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.342
AND THEY MADE
A DECISION IN THE END

15:42.442 --> 15:44.944
TO STAY TOGETHER.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.482
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE
THE CASE HERE, PAUL.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.218
Paul:
WELL, THE ONLY
REASON I MENTION IT

15:51.318 --> 15:54.354
IS BECAUSE I WANT
YOU TO KNOW

15:54.454 --> 15:56.556
THAT, EVEN WHEN DIVORCE
BECOMES A POSSIBILITY,

15:56.656 --> 16:00.360
IT ISN'T ALWAYS SO FINAL.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.262
ARE YOU TRYING
TO CHANGE OUR MINDS?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.498
YOUR MIND.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.900
THIS PARTICULAR COUPLE
HAD PROBLEMS.

16:08.001 --> 16:10.703
THEY COULDN'T EVEN HOLD
A CIVIL CONVERSATION
WITH EACH OTHER.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.272
THEY SLEPT
IN SEPARATE BEDROOMS--

16:12.372 --> 16:14.074
WHY?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.810
THERE'D BEEN AN AFFAIR

16:17.910 --> 16:20.580
- Jake: WHO CHEATED?
- THAT'S NOT REALLY THE POINT.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.383
THERE'S BEEN NO INFIDELITY
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.852
Paul:
I'M NOT INFERRING
THAT, AMY.

16:25.952 --> 16:30.457
I GUESS WHAT I'M
TRYING TO SAY IS THAT
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.360
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES PEOPLE
HAVE TO GET TO THIS PRECIPICE

16:33.460 --> 16:36.496
TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN
TO EACH OTHER.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.702
I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.908
DON'T YOU THINK
THERE ARE STILL SOME

16:49.008 --> 16:52.712
VERY POSITIVE ASPECTS
TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.447
LIKE WHAT?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.216
THE MURDER THREATS,
THE SUSPICION,

16:56.316 --> 16:59.352
THE RECORDINGS,
THE STAKEOUTS, WHAT?

16:59.452 --> 17:02.889
I SEE IT
IN THE WAY THAT YOU LOOK
AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES,

17:02.989 --> 17:04.891
THE WAY YOU MAKE
EACH OTHER LAUGH.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.827
AND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING

17:07.927 --> 17:09.262
ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP
PRETTY STEADILY

17:09.362 --> 17:11.364
BY COMING HERE
EVERY WEEK.

17:13.966 --> 17:17.337
AMY, ARE YOU
CHEATING ON ME?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.639
NO.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.442
SO WHY DID PAUL
JUST TELL US ABOUT
THAT OTHER COUPLE THEN?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.579
- WAS THAT STORY
ABOUT YOU?
- NO, IT--

17:26.679 --> 17:28.348
OF COURSE IT WAS ABOUT HIM.
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.183
DID SHE TELL YOU
SHE WAS CHEATING
ON ME OR NOT?

17:30.283 --> 17:31.751
I'M SUPPOSED TO HEAR
EVERYTHING, REMEMBER?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.087
I'M NOT CHEATING.

17:36.022 --> 17:37.990
Paul:
LISTEN.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.459
NEITHER OF YOU
IS OPENING UP HERE.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.061
YOU'RE BOTH TOO BUSY
ATTACKING EACH OTHER.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.430
I WANT YOU TO LISTEN.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.732
I WANT EACH
OF YOU TO EXAMINE

17:45.832 --> 17:48.135
YOUR OWN CULPABILITY HERE,

17:48.235 --> 17:50.803
NOT CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING
FOR WHAT'S WRONG

17:50.903 --> 17:52.239
WITH THE OTHER PERSON.

17:52.339 --> 17:54.107
AND NOT TO BE SO ON GUARD
ALL THE TIME.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.144
ON GUARD? WHAT, ARE WE
PLAYING POKER OR SOMETHING?

17:57.244 --> 17:58.645
I COME HERE
TO SAVE MY MARRIAGE
AND NOW YOU TELL ME

17:58.745 --> 18:01.314
- SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR?
- HE NEVER SAID THAT.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.516
SO YOU ARE HERE
TO SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.

18:03.616 --> 18:05.618
NO, I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A THING FOR YOU, PAUL.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.854
Paul: YOU'RE HERE
TO SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE.
YOU JUST SAID IT.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.190
NOW SAY IT TO AMY.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.960
JAKE, LOOK AT YOUR WIFE

18:14.060 --> 18:16.095
AND TELL HER.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.254
JAKE, WE'RE
CONSTANTLY FIGHTING.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.023
WE'LL STAY TOGETHER
AND THEN WE WON'T FIGHT.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.794
IF WE STAY TOGETHER,
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP.
EVEN PAUL SAID SO.

18:57.404 --> 19:00.640
WHAT WAS ALL
THIS THERAPY FOR, HUH?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.449
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.952
PAUL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

19:13.052 --> 19:15.688
TALK TO YOUR WIFE.
SAY IT TO AMY.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.248
AMY, I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.782
JAKE, STOP, PLEASE.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.218
Jake:
NO, LISTEN TO ME, I WANT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.792
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.864
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.734
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.180
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN,
LIKE, A WEEK.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.215
I CAN'T SLEEP,
I CAN'T EAT.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.451
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.921
BUT I REALLY--

20:22.021 --> 20:23.690
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME.

20:26.826 --> 20:30.930
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.
PLEASE DON'T FUCKING LEAVE ME.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.346
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.
( sobbing )
