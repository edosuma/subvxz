03:06.518 --> 03:07.769
Genghis.

03:35.487 --> 03:38.282
From death,
Genghis travels to your dreams...

03:39.260 --> 03:41.303
to voice his great displeasure.

03:42.391 --> 03:43.767
He does not.

03:43.852 --> 03:47.110
Then why visit you
night after night?

03:47.397 --> 03:48.648
To laud your actions?

03:50.024 --> 03:52.441
And now, the people riot.

03:53.069 --> 03:55.071
They shut down your Chinese streets.

03:55.154 --> 03:58.558
It is the Song that riot
from grief over their Emperor.

03:59.075 --> 04:01.763
I have torn from them
their last remaining hope.

04:02.454 --> 04:04.164
Exactly as I wished to.

04:05.374 --> 04:08.085
We'll see how your brothers
cast their votes.

04:09.085 --> 04:10.369
Kaidu could die as well.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.464
Die very easily.

04:13.423 --> 04:17.594
How many elections will you run off with?
How many opponents murdered?

04:18.302 --> 04:19.406
And all for what?

04:20.221 --> 04:22.640
That you may kill children with impunity?

04:23.933 --> 04:27.479
Think, my Chabi, think.

04:29.147 --> 04:31.665
- When was the last time?
- Last time what?

04:32.358 --> 04:34.080
Last time you did something hard?

04:35.445 --> 04:38.425
Something that made
your delicate stomach turn?

04:39.282 --> 04:43.327
Something that you did not think
could ever, ever be forgiven?

04:43.412 --> 04:45.414
- Kublai...
- You did not.

04:45.497 --> 04:47.408
Because it is only I.

04:48.041 --> 04:50.501
I, I, I.

04:50.585 --> 04:54.047
I took the wall, I executed my brother,

04:54.130 --> 04:56.883
I do what must be done for our empire.

04:56.966 --> 04:58.331
Please, Kublai...

04:58.415 --> 05:01.304
I don't care what you say.
I don't care what you object to.

05:06.518 --> 05:07.811
Get out!

05:07.894 --> 05:09.479
At once, Sire.

05:16.820 --> 05:19.946
I'm done listening to you!
Done taking your advice!

05:20.490 --> 05:22.659
I'm done, Chabi, done!

05:23.010 --> 05:25.602
Then who will you listen to,
my Great Khan?

05:27.371 --> 05:31.274
Who will you ask if Kaidu lives or dies?

05:40.510 --> 05:43.131
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- I cannot.

05:43.763 --> 05:46.099
For weeks, he made them
stare at that little boy's body

05:46.182 --> 05:48.893
until they rioted
and burned their own streets.

05:48.977 --> 05:50.812
I'm glad they took him down.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.631
He has always heeded Ahmad over me.

05:56.901 --> 06:00.071
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't?

06:01.364 --> 06:03.637
Your advice wasn't followed.

06:04.283 --> 06:06.382
Well, don't rub it in.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.517
Someday you'll be Khan,

06:08.830 --> 06:11.181
someone else is going to question
your decision

06:11.666 --> 06:14.586
and be certain
their advice was the best advice.

06:17.213 --> 06:19.048
That's not the job of the Khan.

06:20.383 --> 06:22.910
And what is the job, oh, wise one?

06:25.388 --> 06:27.006
To make a decision...

06:27.766 --> 06:30.493
forget about the outcome
of other possibilities.

06:31.394 --> 06:34.188
And who was right,
and who was wrong, and...

06:34.272 --> 06:36.607
who is the brother
your father most heeds.

06:38.484 --> 06:39.740
You are the heir.

06:42.113 --> 06:44.382
And you are most splendid, aren't you?

07:01.424 --> 07:04.468
This is a place of sacred training.

07:04.553 --> 07:06.221
Not a drunk hole.

07:09.849 --> 07:11.596
I must have fallen asleep...

07:12.268 --> 07:13.630
after the wine.

07:16.064 --> 07:18.075
How are you upright?

07:18.399 --> 07:19.608
I'm a man.

07:19.693 --> 07:21.945
I haven't quite determined what you are.

07:22.028 --> 07:24.864
If you wish to lecture me again
on drunken disillusionment...

07:24.948 --> 07:27.909
I don't... or care to listen
to your childish outrage,

07:27.992 --> 07:31.329
or pitiful hero worship,
or little-boy troubles.

07:32.163 --> 07:34.999
It was your emperor he murdered,
not mine.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.427
Why should this upset me more than you?

07:38.795 --> 07:43.257
A man wishing to be unhappy
finds many ways to prove his course.

07:45.093 --> 07:46.810
And what do you wish for, Sifu?

07:48.012 --> 07:51.474
What is your desire
that makes palatable a child's murder?

07:52.391 --> 07:54.252
Yes, tell us, monk.

07:57.438 --> 07:58.826
What is it you wish?

08:00.316 --> 08:02.986
I have no goal, Sire, but peace.

08:03.903 --> 08:06.740
You, with me.

08:40.374 --> 08:41.500
Go.

08:46.920 --> 08:47.963
Is that wise?

08:57.791 --> 08:59.834
We are climbing, yes?

09:01.961 --> 09:03.547
To the top.

09:06.841 --> 09:08.510
May I know why?

09:47.173 --> 09:49.676
Word of our impending arrival?

09:49.759 --> 09:51.595
Hello, brother. Yes.

09:52.636 --> 09:53.846
We should go.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.390
My actions proved out too severe.

09:57.016 --> 10:00.144
Your thoughts regarding the boy
might have been more correct.

10:02.313 --> 10:04.190
We do not know
whose advice was more correct,

10:04.273 --> 10:06.210
- because mine was not followed.
- That is very kind, brother,

10:06.234 --> 10:09.070
but we know mine was not,
because it was.

10:10.363 --> 10:14.493
And now, weeks of needless violence
have ensued as outcome.

10:16.452 --> 10:18.920
Perhaps this journey
we can work to be as one mind.

10:19.914 --> 10:20.952
I would like that.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.710
So, words of advice?

10:26.712 --> 10:28.589
Diplomacy is your strength.

10:29.924 --> 10:32.051
You don't need my words.
Just be yourself.

10:32.135 --> 10:33.660
You mean the "Chinese Prince"?

10:34.137 --> 10:36.555
I assure you, I've been called much worse.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.687
Give me his name.

11:03.291 --> 11:04.967
The white devil you traveled with.

11:07.670 --> 11:10.173
My brother sent me here as spy

11:10.256 --> 11:12.847
long before these animals
shattered the wall of the Song.

11:13.301 --> 11:14.969
I've been a prisoner ever since.

11:15.053 --> 11:16.888
Yes.

11:17.847 --> 11:19.223
You look like a prisoner.

11:19.307 --> 11:21.600
The Khan also holds my daughter.

11:22.476 --> 11:23.895
I had no choice.

11:26.647 --> 11:28.007
I didn't know they would kill him.

11:28.858 --> 11:30.902
I swear to you, I didn't know.

11:34.655 --> 11:36.432
You have access still

11:36.825 --> 11:39.536
to the underground of the Song
and all their resources south?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.663
I am the underground.

11:42.288 --> 11:44.271
We share a common enemy.

11:44.958 --> 11:47.586
There's much we can do for each other.

11:47.901 --> 11:49.378
Do for you.

11:49.462 --> 11:52.944
What if I could give you both
the man and the vengeance you seek?

11:54.968 --> 11:57.095
Do for me and I'll do for you.

13:18.342 --> 13:20.413
I wish to know the purpose of this climb.

13:22.471 --> 13:25.391
To ask Tengri if Kaidu lives or dies.

13:31.605 --> 13:35.359
- Your enemy is on the steppe.
- What enemy?

13:35.443 --> 13:37.028
Kublai travels to the heartland?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
Never.

13:38.487 --> 13:40.708
It is he, or one of his blood.

13:40.943 --> 13:42.653
The prince, most likely.

13:42.736 --> 13:43.930
How do you know?

13:43.955 --> 13:46.680
To ask is to make
obvious your ignorance.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.368
But to accept your witchery
is to trot out my smarts?

13:49.451 --> 13:52.879
Finally, Kublai sees my challenge
must be answered.

13:53.330 --> 13:56.041
And what of the eight heads
he sent back with his bastard?

13:56.125 --> 13:57.584
His name is Byamba.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.587
Will that go unanswered as well?

13:59.827 --> 14:04.133
Kublai made a display of strength
to show he took my challenge seriously.

14:04.216 --> 14:07.778
Whereas you display weakness
by letting it pass.

14:08.262 --> 14:10.890
I'm sure your father
would do just the same.

14:14.309 --> 14:15.534
Gather your brother.

14:16.020 --> 14:18.022
- To do what?
- Send a message.

14:18.563 --> 14:21.024
Byamba returned with heads
and so will you.

14:21.108 --> 14:23.903
Why don't I just go to Cambulac
and take Kublai's head as well?

14:23.986 --> 14:25.270
If only.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
Go.

14:28.657 --> 14:30.284
What do I tell Byamba?

14:32.411 --> 14:33.411
Go!

14:40.961 --> 14:42.062
Did you bring it?

14:59.479 --> 15:02.274
You are ready to name an heir?

15:03.275 --> 15:05.735
Why do you think
I asked you to bring it, Mother?

15:09.239 --> 15:11.867
Orus will be so pleased.

15:21.543 --> 15:24.338
Six months before you shred
enough sinew for that bow,

15:24.421 --> 15:25.857
if it's gonna have the proper spring.

15:25.881 --> 15:29.552
Worry not. It will have explosive power.

15:29.634 --> 15:30.821
Too bad you broke the old one.

15:30.845 --> 15:32.555
Too bad for Arban's fat head.

15:34.223 --> 15:36.308
Orus, get your things. We're going.

15:36.391 --> 15:38.185
- Where?
- Now!

15:42.356 --> 15:45.150
- You're leaving?
- We've been through this.

15:45.234 --> 15:47.152
There's things you can't
talk about with me.

15:47.236 --> 15:49.404
Yes. With you.

15:58.538 --> 16:00.999
Because you don't want to know.

16:03.502 --> 16:04.503
Patience.

16:05.004 --> 16:06.324
Just a little longer, and then...

16:06.380 --> 16:08.924
We may fuck and hunt
and live as we wish.

16:11.468 --> 16:14.185
Just say goodbye, all right?

16:14.972 --> 16:16.154
Goodbye.

16:49.924 --> 16:51.801
Colder today than yesterday.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.220
Yes, Sire.

16:59.308 --> 17:00.927
And the wind picked up.

17:02.686 --> 17:04.229
Yes, Sire.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.775
You call me "sire" one more time,

17:08.858 --> 17:11.152
and I'll throw you down
this fucking mountain.

17:12.737 --> 17:14.196
How have I displeased you?

17:14.281 --> 17:16.407
By being the yellow-livered bitch.

17:17.284 --> 17:19.628
I've displeased you,
and we both know it.

17:20.787 --> 17:22.198
We will speak of what you saw.

17:25.876 --> 17:27.828
You were charged with fetching the boy.

17:28.337 --> 17:30.416
You did. His death indicts you.

17:33.456 --> 17:35.927
Did it never occur to you,
day after day,

17:36.011 --> 17:37.513
searching the slums of the south,

17:37.596 --> 17:40.335
that I would have no choice
but to kill the boy?

17:46.438 --> 17:49.274
- It was not for me to think of.
- No.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.028
Because then you would have
to distend your precious virgin sacs

17:53.112 --> 17:55.698
and shoulder the burden
for the bloody outcome.

17:57.699 --> 17:58.700
Say it!

18:02.204 --> 18:03.419
Speak!

18:07.126 --> 18:09.837
I never thought
you would stoop to kill a boy.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.467
That boy was the Emperor of China!

18:17.511 --> 18:19.554
Good. He follows.

19:12.857 --> 19:14.568
Look who it is.

19:14.651 --> 19:17.070
It's the son of the Great Khan of Khans.

19:18.863 --> 19:21.825
Arban of the North Horde,

19:22.134 --> 19:23.598
Gerel of the West...

19:24.161 --> 19:26.205
we are honored
that you would receive us.

19:26.288 --> 19:28.405
The Great Kublai Khan
does not come to us,

19:28.430 --> 19:30.450
or so much as invite us to him.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.877
Instead, he dispatches his heir.

19:32.961 --> 19:36.784
You would greet us with insults
directed at royal blood?

19:40.344 --> 19:41.311
Vice Regent,

19:41.336 --> 19:44.192
we'd befoolish not to expect
some disappointment at our arrival.

19:44.745 --> 19:47.577
When one awaits the Great Khan,
we must accept our roles as...

19:48.060 --> 19:49.770
lesser emissaries.

19:50.097 --> 19:52.982
- You take no offense at our letdown?
- None at all.

19:53.898 --> 19:56.610
Nor do we take as treason
that you've already convened with Kaidu

19:56.953 --> 19:59.554
and troubled yourself
to travel to Karakorum for the honor.

19:59.988 --> 20:02.240
- We were invited.
- Under somewhat false pretenses.

20:02.324 --> 20:03.325
A hunt was all.

20:03.408 --> 20:04.910
Somehow moldered
to vote gathering.

20:04.993 --> 20:05.993
Gentlemen.

20:06.745 --> 20:08.816
My cousin Kaidu is a man of heart.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.040
He means what's best for all Mongols

20:11.125 --> 20:14.253
by asking this question
and forcing its answer.

20:15.212 --> 20:16.839
Who is the rightful Khan of Khans?

20:18.132 --> 20:19.508
You've listened to his side.

20:20.259 --> 20:22.393
Now I will present my father's case.

20:23.428 --> 20:25.066
And why should we listen to you?

20:26.598 --> 20:29.929
My father is Khan,
but he is also my father.

20:30.519 --> 20:32.687
And no one knows a man like his son.

20:33.605 --> 20:35.865
I can speak of him as no one else can.

20:39.403 --> 20:40.654
A moment.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.409
Is it possible that you enjoyed that?

20:46.410 --> 20:48.495
Your words were sound.

20:52.957 --> 20:54.751
We will listen, Prince Jingim.

20:55.502 --> 20:57.849
Your arrival is auspicious.

20:58.297 --> 21:00.925
Tonight we enjoy a wrestling competition.

21:01.007 --> 21:04.427
My cousin, Ganzorig,
has long been undisputed victor.

21:04.511 --> 21:06.221
Unlike your father.

21:08.973 --> 21:11.193
We wondered if you care
to enter the competition.

21:12.894 --> 21:14.384
I would be most honored.

21:27.951 --> 21:31.455
You climb a mountain
to ask Tengri of the death of Kaidu...

21:32.372 --> 21:33.916
but you execute a child...

21:34.916 --> 21:37.335
against the wishes of all
you've come to trust.

21:37.419 --> 21:39.171
All? Who is all?

21:40.505 --> 21:41.506
The Empress.

21:41.590 --> 21:45.051
My first wife and myself
are as one mind, on all matters.

21:45.135 --> 21:46.511
All and every.

21:46.595 --> 21:49.514
But on this issue, you're not.

21:50.432 --> 21:52.059
Nor your son, the prince.

21:52.142 --> 21:54.603
I followed Ahmad's advice.

21:55.729 --> 21:58.289
What? Is he less my son than Jingim?

22:01.067 --> 22:04.237
- Blood is all that matters?
- Of course not.

22:05.697 --> 22:08.367
I pick my family,
and isn't it nice?

22:08.450 --> 22:10.995
Certainly, if you could and did,

22:11.077 --> 22:13.955
you'd have fixed upon
a much better choice of father.

22:14.038 --> 22:15.874
Or did you hold to the child's wish?

22:15.957 --> 22:18.685
"He had his reasons.
He meant well at heart."

22:20.212 --> 22:22.089
Lies we tell ourselves at night

22:22.172 --> 22:25.259
so as not to feel in our souls
like the shit of pigs.

22:29.388 --> 22:31.891
I owe my father a debt of gratitude.

22:33.350 --> 22:35.769
He was a pig shit and he knew it.

22:39.439 --> 22:43.027
- I tell myself no lies about my father.
- No.

22:43.818 --> 22:46.109
Only lies about yourself.

22:50.742 --> 22:52.452
He shows himself.

22:54.788 --> 22:55.830
Don't move.

22:55.914 --> 22:57.541
Don't blink.

22:59.376 --> 23:01.170
Don't show your teeth.

23:03.255 --> 23:05.465
You can't retreat. You can't attack.

23:06.758 --> 23:08.677
You have to stare down the wolf.

23:29.698 --> 23:31.332
It will be dark soon.

23:33.660 --> 23:34.786
Yes.

23:55.223 --> 23:57.683
- Good day, Batbayer.
- Good day, My Lady.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.537
Her leg is much improved.

24:00.354 --> 24:01.563
You have a way with the mares.

24:01.646 --> 24:03.765
I'm pleased to hear so,
My Lady.

24:03.848 --> 24:05.233
And I am very grateful.

24:06.610 --> 24:08.702
What did we say about riding...

24:09.112 --> 24:10.739
in your condition?

24:13.032 --> 24:14.463
I'm in no condition.

24:14.868 --> 24:17.016
I ride to soothe
my terrible disappointment.

24:19.122 --> 24:22.000
Well, I have just the thing to cheer you.

24:28.465 --> 24:30.208
I'm glad they took him down.

24:30.675 --> 24:32.342
Thoughts on brighter things.

24:32.969 --> 24:34.678
- Yes, Mother.
- For the baby.

24:35.054 --> 24:36.263
Yes, Mother.

24:36.681 --> 24:39.809
- But, as I said, there is no baby.
- Yet.

24:40.090 --> 24:42.729
There will be a baby, Princess Kokachin.

24:42.812 --> 24:44.147
We will see to it.

24:44.230 --> 24:47.025
- We?
- Both of us.

24:47.108 --> 24:48.230
Yes, Mother.

24:48.860 --> 24:52.238
They are innocent.
Be grateful you are not.

24:53.197 --> 24:56.117
Innocence in all things is
beautiful and terrible.

25:15.937 --> 25:17.520
Where did you send Khutulun?

25:17.889 --> 25:20.058
- Byamba...
- Where did you send her?

25:20.141 --> 25:21.350
Byamba.

25:23.269 --> 25:24.270
So many secrets.

25:24.354 --> 25:26.738
Small price to pay
for the love of a good woman.

25:27.315 --> 25:29.984
And there's no better woman
on earth than my daughter.

25:31.695 --> 25:33.822
- I meant no disrespect.
- Didn't you?

25:38.785 --> 25:41.162
The gerege of the House of Ögödei.

25:42.205 --> 25:45.458
I'm giving it to Khutulun
when I tell her she's my heir.

25:46.710 --> 25:47.711
But Orus?

25:47.794 --> 25:50.839
She rides as well, fights as well,
hunts as well, if not better.

25:52.256 --> 25:55.885
You're a smart and bold warrior, Byamba.
Who would you choose?

25:55.969 --> 25:57.220
Just think...

25:58.221 --> 26:01.349
after a lifetime in Cambulac
as the bastard's son.

26:02.934 --> 26:04.060
What an honor.

26:05.228 --> 26:08.356
Husband to the first female Mongol Khan.

26:15.989 --> 26:17.907
What is the price of that?

26:33.673 --> 26:35.222
You wish to walk the fire?

26:38.386 --> 26:39.637
I do not.

26:41.681 --> 26:44.142
But I do wish to know
how Father does it.

26:45.184 --> 26:47.756
No mystery. He simply walks.

26:48.146 --> 26:49.605
Why doesn't he burn?

26:50.774 --> 26:52.276
Is he pure of heart?

26:52.901 --> 26:55.157
No man who leads is pure of heart.

26:56.946 --> 26:59.365
Will that be the watchword
at your first Kurultai?

26:59.733 --> 27:02.368
I will win based on looks
and strength alone.

27:02.452 --> 27:05.705
Looks, strength,
and dumber than goat shit.

27:06.677 --> 27:09.042
Better start learning
your words of Genghis.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.142
Do you suppose it's possible
to be both pure of heart

27:14.167 --> 27:16.281
and impure at the same time?

27:17.884 --> 27:21.137
To order men to death
is not the work of the unclouded.

27:21.220 --> 27:23.069
Is that what it is to be leader?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.434
Ordering men to death?

27:26.434 --> 27:28.519
You might do well
finding ways to avoid it.

27:29.103 --> 27:30.381
A woman's way.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.983
You only call me female when
there's no other way to say I'm wrong.

27:34.067 --> 27:38.613
Either way, I'm a far better choice
than our Chinese Prince.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.161
Take him down.

27:46.496 --> 27:47.747
Get him.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.168
What will you tell your father,
I wonder, of our warm hospitality?

27:52.251 --> 27:56.047
And our great goodwill
and eagerness to pamper a royal guest?

27:56.130 --> 27:58.007
Should one ever deign to come to us.

27:58.389 --> 28:00.093
A magnificent feast.

28:00.176 --> 28:02.595
We thank you
for your incredible generosity.

28:05.515 --> 28:06.516
Ganzorig!

28:24.868 --> 28:26.244
Any more advice?

28:28.955 --> 28:31.625
Sometimes a draw
is as good as a victory.

31:01.482 --> 31:06.362
I'm sure you know
that certain foods, certain delicacies,

31:06.445 --> 31:08.948
assist greatly
with the goal of pregnancy.

31:09.991 --> 31:11.743
Are they pleasant? No.

31:11.826 --> 31:14.054
Are they sumptuous? No, but...

31:14.328 --> 31:17.123
we can eat or be eaten.

31:24.839 --> 31:27.133
The Kurultai fast approaches.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.177
Yes, I know.

31:29.260 --> 31:34.348
Do you also know that it is imperative
for Jingim to have an heir before then?

31:36.350 --> 31:39.110
You will swell, Blue Princess...

31:39.854 --> 31:42.320
or the Great Khan will surely lose.

31:46.235 --> 31:48.654
I would do anything for my Khan.

31:58.832 --> 32:00.959
Beautiful...

32:02.168 --> 32:03.586
and terrible.

32:35.076 --> 32:36.745
Great Khan, you should rest.

32:36.828 --> 32:38.747
We can make camp. I will keep watch.

32:38.830 --> 32:40.624
I wish not for rest.

32:40.706 --> 32:43.251
He waits for me in my dreams.

32:44.252 --> 32:46.545
Genghis and his fucking words.

32:47.088 --> 32:50.216
"Conquering the world is less an art
than conquering a man."

32:51.134 --> 32:53.302
That's what he says.

32:53.386 --> 32:56.347
Is he saying, in some ways,
the wall meant nothing?

32:56.430 --> 32:59.194
The wall I took?

32:59.600 --> 33:02.019
The one that stayed
beyond Genghis's reach?

33:06.524 --> 33:09.568
What he's saying is,
outcomes good or bad...

33:10.236 --> 33:15.154
in war times or peace,
a leader can never, ever come out on top.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.923
Kaidu thinks he craves this,
the yoke of command...

33:20.413 --> 33:23.499
burden of responsibility.

33:24.458 --> 33:27.628
As a child,
he pissed himself at thunder!

33:29.172 --> 33:32.717
He cannot do the hard thing,
the necessary thing.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.881
And you know why, oh, pale one?

33:35.546 --> 33:36.679
Because, like most men,

33:36.762 --> 33:40.516
he lacks the strength of heart and mind
to bear the consequence.

33:41.059 --> 33:42.298
Just like you.

33:42.977 --> 33:47.023
You don't wish to carry the consequence
of finding the boy and bringing him back.

33:47.106 --> 33:48.441
And you don't have to

33:48.524 --> 33:51.319
because you have me to blame, to indict.

33:52.028 --> 33:56.449
A living, breathing pin cushion
for the sins of all and everyone!

33:57.283 --> 33:59.911
What Kaidu doesn't know, Latin,
what no man knows,

33:59.994 --> 34:02.956
is sometimes
that's all there is to being Khan.

34:03.873 --> 34:06.000
Terrible things you're required to do,

34:06.084 --> 34:08.293
even and especially
when you don't want to.

34:14.967 --> 34:18.664
I say without shame,
it gave me no pleasure to kill that boy.

34:21.764 --> 34:23.601
No pleasure at all.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.790
Sire, stay back.

34:49.002 --> 34:50.335
Stare back at him.

34:51.712 --> 34:52.713
Don't look away.

34:55.049 --> 34:56.384
Don't move.

35:13.317 --> 35:14.318
You see?

35:16.362 --> 35:17.696
You see?

35:25.163 --> 35:27.456
We stared him down.

36:03.576 --> 36:04.993
Let's go home.

36:06.620 --> 36:08.456
What about Tengri and Kaidu?

36:08.539 --> 36:10.791
I think Tengri has spoken.

36:19.842 --> 36:22.177
We cannot name
you victor since most...

36:22.845 --> 36:24.555
or all your moves were forbidden.

36:25.223 --> 36:26.265
Of course.

36:26.290 --> 36:28.726
But... you did show admirable bravery

36:28.809 --> 36:32.062
and honorable honorableness
in gamesmanship.

36:32.600 --> 36:36.734
And a man such as this is,
perhaps, not the son of a thief.

36:37.693 --> 36:39.069
You'll meet with my father?

36:39.153 --> 36:41.209
If he comes to Xanadu.

36:41.697 --> 36:44.116
His summer palace,
where we can meet as nomads

36:44.200 --> 36:45.684
on Mongol soil.

36:45.826 --> 36:49.246
Not in China, inside his Chinese walls.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.625
If he meets us there,
we will hear him out.

36:55.878 --> 36:56.879
Safe travels.

37:10.726 --> 37:13.521
If it's all right, Sire,
I will retire to my quarters.

37:13.604 --> 37:16.690
No, it's not all right.
You will come with me to the throne room.

37:17.608 --> 37:20.486
- Now?
- You question me?

37:20.569 --> 37:22.676
Only that there might be sense to sleep.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.139
No. We have urgent business.

37:26.033 --> 37:27.492
My husband.

37:28.702 --> 37:30.162
My wife.

37:30.913 --> 37:32.665
Let me have a hot bath prepared.

37:32.748 --> 37:34.292
I have matters to see to.

37:35.418 --> 37:37.654
Oh, so you have decided.

37:38.337 --> 37:40.548
And what did Tengri say of Kaidu's fate?

37:40.631 --> 37:44.218
Do not bother yourself, wife,
with such matters of state.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.220
You share with this foreigner,

37:47.750 --> 37:49.307
but not with me?

37:54.395 --> 37:58.524
This foreigner saved my life.
Even when he didn't want to.

37:58.607 --> 38:01.319
Even when he thought
my life was worth nothing.

38:01.944 --> 38:03.654
His heart proved out.

38:04.822 --> 38:06.449
He did a hard thing.

38:40.274 --> 38:43.945
Genghis was born with his destiny
ordained by heaven above.

38:44.945 --> 38:47.405
He was descended from Börte Üjin...

38:48.282 --> 38:50.743
whose name means "blue-gray wolf."

38:52.605 --> 38:56.665
It was Genghis who founded
the Secret Order of the Mongol Knights...

38:57.833 --> 39:01.294
picked from the sons
of his most loyal generals.

39:02.630 --> 39:05.007
My grandfather's personal guard.

39:06.008 --> 39:07.292
His agents.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.365
His keshig.

39:10.554 --> 39:12.213
But on rare occasions,

39:12.848 --> 39:16.228
men of lower blood but of Mongol heart,

39:16.560 --> 39:19.563
have achieved rank in the keshig order.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.694
Do you wish to believe in blood, Marco?

39:27.196 --> 39:29.198
Or something bigger than that?

39:40.376 --> 39:44.422
Marco Polo,
you have proven of great worth to me.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.924
This I wish you to know as truth.

39:48.967 --> 39:51.560
And that is why, by the blood of Genghis

39:52.012 --> 39:53.965
and under the Eternal Blue...

39:55.724 --> 39:58.871
I conscript you
into the Order of the Mongol Knights.

39:59.937 --> 40:02.105
You will need the courage of a warrior...

40:04.024 --> 40:05.712
and the loyalty of a son.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.122
Wear it.

40:20.207 --> 40:22.500
Walk with me always.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.671
You honor me, Great Khan.

40:26.839 --> 40:28.173
Hmm.

40:31.344 --> 40:33.221
What are your plans for Kaidu?

40:35.514 --> 40:37.266
We will stare him down.

41:00.956 --> 41:03.333
Protect the prince! Protect the prince!

41:05.544 --> 41:07.463
Protect the prince!

41:07.546 --> 41:10.091
Protect the prince!

41:30.986 --> 41:34.281
Your life is in our hands, Prince.
We can get you anytime.

41:36.534 --> 41:38.327
I expected more from you.

41:39.036 --> 41:40.502
You shouldn't have.

41:41.246 --> 41:42.289
Come on.

41:46.794 --> 41:48.170
How dare you?

41:51.424 --> 41:52.800
Shut your mouth.

41:52.883 --> 41:54.760
You can address me as "Vice Regent."

41:54.843 --> 41:55.844
Orus! Come on.

41:55.928 --> 41:57.721
I can address you
as "Sand Worshipper."

41:57.805 --> 42:03.060
Or "Bastard."
Or "Lackey to a fat and useless Khan."

42:24.623 --> 42:26.500
They got us this time, Ahmad.

42:26.584 --> 42:29.044
Come on. Let's go.

42:35.884 --> 42:36.927
One more.

43:20.387 --> 43:22.764
Is it punishment enough, I wonder...

43:24.975 --> 43:27.435
trying to kill my beloved?

43:28.562 --> 43:30.022
No, my Emperor.

44:05.641 --> 44:07.310
How does it feel?

44:09.645 --> 44:12.064
Delivering your Emperor to death?

44:17.027 --> 44:19.112
My great, great Emperor...

44:20.155 --> 44:21.865
stands before me.

44:25.118 --> 44:26.328
Suck my cock.

44:28.330 --> 44:29.664
With pleasure.

44:35.838 --> 44:38.131
Keep lying. It suits you.

45:20.340 --> 45:23.010
What's wrong?

45:23.586 --> 45:24.803
What happened?

45:24.887 --> 45:26.304
My sweet girl.

45:57.795 --> 46:01.006
It is time to see if you really meant it.

46:01.089 --> 46:03.258
You would do anything for your Khan.

46:45.258 --> 46:46.885
Just look at me.

46:48.303 --> 46:50.388
Look at me. In my eyes.

46:51.431 --> 46:52.890
Just look at me.

46:53.433 --> 46:55.435
- Mother.
- Just look at me!

46:55.518 --> 46:57.395
Mother, please.

46:57.479 --> 46:58.771
Shh!

46:58.856 --> 47:00.483
Shh!

47:02.818 --> 47:06.864
The child will not have full royal blood.

47:06.947 --> 47:08.519
Actually...

47:08.991 --> 47:12.285
the child will have no royal blood.
