WEBVTT

00:04.572 --> 00:06.074
Previously on ER:

00:06.107 --> 00:08.776
Look, Luka...

00:08.809 --> 00:11.079
I'm glad we're friends.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.246
But I've got a dad.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.115
Fingernails,
tattoo, the hair?

00:14.148 --> 00:16.550
It's the whole package.
Well, I'll talk
to my band mates

00:16.584 --> 00:18.119
and see if I can't
pull it back a little.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.687
You off?
Yeah.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.356
If you wait for a second,
I'll walk out with you.

00:22.856 --> 00:23.824
Okay.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.393
Damn it!

00:25.426 --> 00:27.195
( speaking Chinese )

00:27.228 --> 00:28.429
Son of a bitch!

00:28.462 --> 00:29.663
He should be in a nursing home.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.165
I'd never do that to him.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.301
You can stay here for tonight.
Plenty of room.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.803
Actually, you can stay
as long as you'd like.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.407
( shower running )

00:46.214 --> 00:47.181
KOVAC:
Hey.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.482
SAM:
Hey. How was your night?

00:48.516 --> 00:49.717
The usual.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.385
Anything good?

00:51.419 --> 00:55.289
Uh, guy got his arm caught
in a sausage-making machine.

00:55.323 --> 00:56.390
( chuckling )

00:56.424 --> 00:58.459
Nice.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.760
I'm not on until 9:00.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.262
I can drop Alex
off at school,

01:01.295 --> 01:02.430
but can you pick
him up at 3:00?

01:02.463 --> 01:05.333
Sure. After I get
some sleep.

01:06.167 --> 01:07.268
Morning.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.871
( yawns )

01:10.904 --> 01:14.808
Mom, I need ten bucks
for the class field trip
to Millennium Park.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.210
Okay.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.645
They've got
a giant silver sculpture

01:17.678 --> 01:20.548
shaped like a bean.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.550
If I don't get the
money in today,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.685
I have to stay behind
and do homework with
the fifth graders.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.456
Okay, okay.

01:31.225 --> 01:34.295
What, you've never
seen a kid pee before?

01:38.632 --> 01:40.734
This is gonna bounce.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.337
Whoa. That's a lot of zeros.

01:43.371 --> 01:44.872
Tuition was expensive.

01:44.905 --> 01:46.807
No wonder you're
still sleeping
on Abby's sofa.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.576
You know, you can defer
paying off your loans

01:48.609 --> 01:50.178
until after you
finish residency.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.180
Not this one.
This is for my father.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.847
What? Your dad's
leaning on you?

01:53.881 --> 01:55.616
It's for my brother's
university tuition.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.917
My parents put me
through school,

01:56.950 --> 01:58.319
so now it's my turn to help.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.753
They can't wait until
after residency,

01:59.787 --> 02:01.189
when you're making
the real money?

02:01.189 --> 02:04.192
Is there something
you need, Ray?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.594
How would you like
to work Christmas for me?

02:08.262 --> 02:09.896
I'm already
working New Year's.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.299
Look, you do Christmas,

02:11.332 --> 02:13.201
and I'll take
your New Year's Eve.

02:13.201 --> 02:14.868
You'd work
New Year's Eve?
It's important for my mom

02:14.902 --> 02:16.637
to have us all together
on Christmas.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.206
Come on, I'll take
Ramadan for you.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.673
I'm not Muslim, I'm Sikh.

02:19.707 --> 02:21.209
Oh, great.
Well, I'll cover

02:21.209 --> 02:22.543
whenever you want
to take a Sikh day.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.811
Oh, this is unbelievable.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.779
What? Weaver's got
a boyfriend?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.348
Only 39%
of the staff

02:27.381 --> 02:29.217
has had a flu shot
this year.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.219
I don't want massive
absenteeism in January.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.720
I had mine.
I'll get one today.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.655
How 'bout you, Ray?
Uh, tomorrow.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.857
My band's gotta play
at Delilah's tonight.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.626
Can't have a sore arm.
Sore arm?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.728
How about 100% compliance
by next week?

02:40.761 --> 02:44.298
You have had some lame excuses
for the past two months.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.900
What are you
talking about?
First you had a cold.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.669
Oh, yeah, then you
were sleep-deprived.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.272
Police officer got shot.
ETA: two minutes.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.940
Where's the wound?
I couldn't understand them.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.742
The sirens were too loud.
All right, let's
clear Trauma One.

02:54.775 --> 02:55.809
Neela, Ray, Chuny,
you're with me.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.977
Call upstairs to
the OR and RT.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.412
Mary, get some extra
security down here

02:58.446 --> 03:00.248
to handle the press.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.415
Do me a favor.
Give me a flu shot today.

03:01.449 --> 03:02.850
What?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.852
Yeah, get me when
I'm not expecting it.

03:04.885 --> 03:05.953
Just stick me quick.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.688
I got a thing about needles.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.626
NEELA:
Paramedics probably
have two IVs.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.861
You can go femoral,
if we need it.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.498
( tires screeching )

03:17.531 --> 03:18.932
( brakes squeal )

03:20.501 --> 03:23.971
Eddie Escobar,
caught one in the neck.

03:24.004 --> 03:25.806
Lost a lot of blood.
This is a "throw and go"?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.541
We were ten blocks away.
!
I'm Dr. Lewis.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.709
You're at County General.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.010
You should have called
the paramedics.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.279
We'd still be waiting
on the street.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.680
C-collar.
Board's ready.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.286
One, two, three.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.420
We're going to give you
oxygen through your nose,

03:39.453 --> 03:40.621
okay, Eddie?
Thank you.

03:40.654 --> 03:41.589
Pulse is thready.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.923
Take my keys, Gary.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.492
It's okay, Eddie.
Try not to move.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.294
Someone needs to feed my dogs.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.328
Have an intubation tray ready.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.662
And there's a filing cabinet

03:48.696 --> 03:50.464
in the bedroom
with all my papers.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.799
Yeah, forget
about that.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.401
You're gonna be okay.
Tell him, Doc.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.603
Trauma panel, type and cross
for six units,

03:55.636 --> 03:57.671
call X ray, get
a portable neck and chest.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.058 --> 04:53.994
I threw up all
over Amy's collage.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.729
It was so embarrassing.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.365
Oh, that's okay.

04:57.365 --> 04:59.467
We see like
100 puking kids a day.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.468
Really?

05:00.501 --> 05:01.802
Mm-hmm.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.537
Mom's here.
This is Dr. Lockhart.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.806
Hi.
School nurse
called my office.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.841
Uh, yeah, they sent her in
for vomiting and fever.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.009
Is she okay?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.611
Well, seems like
it's just the flu.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.980
Are you okay, honey?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
I should take her
to see our doctor.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.549
Well, she's here now.
Why don't you...?

05:15.583 --> 05:16.550
I see how busy you are.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.018
Well, it's not that...

05:18.051 --> 05:19.420
You want to go
see Dr. Ben?

05:21.054 --> 05:21.989
( stammers )

05:22.022 --> 05:23.391
Look, it's probably just

05:23.424 --> 05:25.926
the stomach flu.
Let us run a few tests,

05:25.959 --> 05:27.795
we'll give her some IV fluid,
she'll be good as new.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.063
How long's that
going to take?
About an hour.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.132
Can we move her
to a real room?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.934
I'll work on it.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.102
Oh, hey, Sam,
this little girl
needs a line

05:35.135 --> 05:36.136
and Tigan.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.138
You'll have to ask Malik.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.607
Excuse me! Excuse me.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.809
Excuse me!
Sub-Q air, but otherwise okay.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.110
Come on. Excuse me!
Two units oh neg.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.746
Looks like the bullet
missed your spinal cord.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.581
That's good, buddy.
Excuse me.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.617
That's good news.
Sats aren't so hot.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.851
LEWIS:
He needs plastic.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.920
RAY:
Yeah, I'm all over it.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.622
LEWIS:
Eddie, we're gonna stick
a tube down your throat

05:54.655 --> 05:55.856
to give you more oxygen.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.559
Whatever you say, Doc.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.760
You're gonna go
to sleep first.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.529
20 of Etomidate, 800 of SUX.

06:01.562 --> 06:02.863
Everyone else okay?

06:02.896 --> 06:03.831
We're all good, Eddie.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.733
You get the perp?

06:05.766 --> 06:08.436
Couple of double taps
to the chest. He went down.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.437
Go for it, Ray.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.538
SAM:
What happened?

06:10.571 --> 06:11.939
McWAYNE:
Convenience store holdup.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.607
Chased the guy into
an apartment building.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.008
Called for backup,

06:15.042 --> 06:16.710
the scumbag starts shooting

06:16.744 --> 06:17.978
out the window.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.146
All right, there's
too much blood.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.748
SAM:
Pulse ox only 72.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.115
LEWIS:
Okay, pull out
and bag him up.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.984
You want me to do it?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.919
RAY:
No, no, no, I got it.
Give me a straight blade.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.588
You cut yourself.

06:27.621 --> 06:28.956
No, that's...

06:28.989 --> 06:30.924
It's nothing.
We should take care of it.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.192
No, really, it's okay.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.461
One more shot, Ray.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.830
Ray?

06:36.864 --> 06:38.732
Just... give me
some cricoid pressure.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.700
I can get this.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.771
I still can't see the cords.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.739
Okay, that's it.
You want me to try?

06:45.773 --> 06:46.807
How 'bout you try?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.775
RAY:
Crike tray.

06:47.808 --> 06:48.609
Yeah?

06:48.642 --> 06:50.077
Yes. Betadine.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.746
11 blade.
No, Sam, third drawer
of the crash cart.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.714
Get the trake light.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.848
The what?

06:54.882 --> 06:55.816
You going fiber optic?

06:55.849 --> 06:56.950
Not exactly.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.652
Got it.
Where's the scope?

06:58.686 --> 07:00.187
It's a blind procedure.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.055
Great. Who's in charge
of this ER?
That would be me.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.025
You can stay here, sir,
but you have to be quiet.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.995
Okay...

07:08.028 --> 07:10.698
Bend the tip to 90 degrees.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.899
Turn the lights off.

07:17.538 --> 07:21.975
Pass in the midline,
with the jaw forward.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.244
Sats are dropping. Shouldn't
we be prepping the neck?

07:24.277 --> 07:26.747
When you're through
the cords, you'll see
a pre-tracheal glow.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.048
He needs a crike.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.049
That's the glow.
You won't see it

07:29.082 --> 07:30.684
if you're in the esophagus.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.785
Okay, that's it.

07:31.819 --> 07:35.055
Bag him. Turn the lights on.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.089
Very slick.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.991
How about a subclavian?

07:38.025 --> 07:39.760
Okay. Good breath sounds.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.965
Number six gloves,
Dr. Barnett?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.600
Seven and a half.

07:46.634 --> 07:50.203
Sterile drape and
finder needle, please.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.806
OFFICER:
I've got Mallory.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.941
This is Eddie's fiancee.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.142
LEWIS:
Okay.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.044
( sobbing ):
Oh, my God, Eddie...

07:57.077 --> 07:58.879
I'm Dr. Lewis.
He's doing okay.

07:58.912 --> 07:59.880
He was shot?

07:59.913 --> 08:00.914
Once.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.015
In the neck.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.617
He's sedated
with medication,

08:03.651 --> 08:06.654
but you can sit with him,
hold his hand if you want.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.088
I was playing around
with my nephew.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.690
We were wrestling.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.892
Looks like he kicked your butt.
Is the rib sore?

08:11.925 --> 08:13.627
Right there, yeah.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.864
Okay, Mr. Sakabu, I think
it's nothing but a bruise.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.166
What about my shoulder?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.868
( sighs )

08:20.901 --> 08:22.169
Any pain when I press?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.236
It's more on the inside.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
It's probably
just a strain.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.040
I'll have the nurse bring
your discharge instructions.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.578
Hey, hey, hey, I didn't know
you were in today.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.013
Oh, my stupid alarm
didn't go off.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.280
Rough night, huh?

08:34.313 --> 08:35.315
Yeah.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.316
You okay?

08:36.349 --> 08:37.885
Uh-huh.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.054
Okay, got a quick one for you,
ready for discharge.

08:41.087 --> 08:45.092
Uh... give me a couple
of minutes, okay?

08:47.661 --> 08:50.263
Good news. Labs are fine.
White count's not elevated...

08:50.297 --> 08:51.699
So, we can go.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.001
Mom...

08:54.034 --> 08:55.636
( sobbing ):
Mom.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.270
Are you all right, honey?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.271
What's wrong?

08:58.305 --> 08:59.339
It hurts now.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.608
Where does it hurt?

09:00.608 --> 09:01.909
Right here!

09:01.942 --> 09:02.910
Here?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.712
Ow!

09:04.745 --> 09:06.914
So, tell me, does it hurt more
when I take my hand away?

09:06.947 --> 09:09.082
Ow.
Listen, I'm going
to get you

09:09.116 --> 09:11.652
some medicine for
that pain, okay?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.687
I need to run
some more tests.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.022
Start with four of MS.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.624
Thanks.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.125
I thought she'd
be better by now.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.292
Well, sometimes
what starts out

09:19.326 --> 09:20.628
looking like stomach flu

09:20.628 --> 09:21.762
ends up to be
something else.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.263
Like what?
Appendicitis.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.265
You said it
wasn't serious.
Well, it may not be.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.234
I'd just like to have a surgeon
take a look at it...

09:27.267 --> 09:29.269
You think she needs
an operation?
It's a possibility.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.706
Oh, God. No.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.307
No, she's not having
surgery, not here.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.710
If she does need it,
it's a very simple operation.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.245
I need to talk
to my husband.
Okay, there's time.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.147
I need to do
another blood test,
possibly do an X ray...

09:40.180 --> 09:42.916
You can't do surgery without
my permission, right?

09:42.950 --> 09:43.951
Right.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.786
One step at a time, okay?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.755
You call your husband;
I'll get things started.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.761
Excuse me.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.828
Hey, Ray.
Is Carter in there?

09:54.862 --> 09:55.829
No, just Lewis.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.030
How's the cop?

09:57.064 --> 09:58.398
Stable for now.
What's in your hand?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.300
A chart.
Okay, the other hand.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.202
A pen. I didn't say
I'd do it.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.704
Hey, anybody seen Dr. Chen?

10:03.737 --> 10:05.773
Sorry.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.107
Do you have any plans
for New Year's Eve?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.777
You're not really my type.

10:09.810 --> 10:10.811
Funny.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.012
My band's got
a party gig.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.013
Can you take
the p.m. for me?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.047
On New Year's Eve?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.816
Well, look at it this way:

10:15.849 --> 10:19.119
You won't have to go to
a square dance by yourself.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.888
Or with a date,
or whatever.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.723
You give my med student
lecture for me in January.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.224
Deal.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.159
Suspect's been
wounded and
apprehended.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.861
Do we have an ETA?

10:27.895 --> 10:30.163
No, I'm sorry.
They haven't
called it in yet.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.765
We'll be with the family.

10:31.799 --> 10:32.866
Okay.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.234
Ten-year-old girl,
fever, vomiting,

10:34.267 --> 10:35.803
right lower quadrant
tenderness.

10:35.836 --> 10:36.837
Rule out appy.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.039
Yeah, CT
or ultrasound?

10:39.072 --> 10:41.108
It depends.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.244
What the hell was that?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.412
What?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.248
PRATT:
Jing Mei...

10:48.281 --> 10:50.417
Hmm.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.153
Oh, sorry.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.888
Coffee was brewing.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.189
You okay to work?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.358
Uh... uh-huh, yeah, sure.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.160
What have you got?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.195
35-year-old,
strain and sprain.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.097
Chest and shoulder
contusion.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.033
Okay...

11:07.935 --> 11:09.336
You don't want to
see the patient?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.304
No, I trust you.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.106
How's your dad doing?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.407
( sighs )

11:14.441 --> 11:15.976
Okay.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.846
I mean, I've got a nurse
for him 16 hours a day,

11:18.879 --> 11:21.014
and then from 11:00 to
7:00, it's just me.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.015
So, you're not
getting much sleep?

11:22.049 --> 11:23.483
No, a couple hours.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.152
Hey, Dr. Chen,
Carter's got a baby in status.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.287
Need you for that suspect
in that cop shooting.

11:27.320 --> 11:30.290
How soon?
Right now.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.160
( sighs )

11:39.166 --> 11:40.868
Multiple gunshots to
the chest and abdomen.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.936
Any vitals?
No pulse
in the field.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.304
That's the son
of a bitch.
How long was he down?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.039
Cops had to secure the building.

11:46.073 --> 11:48.508
How long did
that take?
They made us wait 45 minutes.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.811
It only takes 20
minutes to bleed out.
If there'd have been

11:50.844 --> 11:52.479
a second shooter in
there, she'd be full
of holes, too, okay?

11:52.512 --> 11:53.513
Prep two of O-neg
on the infuser.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.982
NEELA:
On my count. One, two...

11:55.015 --> 11:57.017
Hold on. Hold on.
He's cuffed.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.952
Who's got the key?
!
Not me. You got
the keys, Tommy?

11:58.986 --> 12:00.487
I'll check with Hogan.
Quickly, please.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.055
Start on the paramedic gurney.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.857
Betadine, 32 french.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.258
Thoracotomy's
all yours, Neela.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.359
You're going to assist?
!
You'll be fine.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.360
Sterile gloves and a 10 blade.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.361
MALIK:
First unit's up.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.797
I need to lift up his arm

12:09.830 --> 12:11.264
to make the incision.
!
Excuse me.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.800
Where's the damn key?
We're working on it.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.334
Malik, get the
bolt cutters.
Take it easy.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.536
I've got it.
Can the officers
wait outside?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.972
The suspect's in police
custody and uncuffed.
We're waiting right here.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.974
I don't think he's
going to jump off
the bed anytime soon.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.310
Hook up the thoraseal.
Give her room to work.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.178
You think he's
got a chance?

12:25.212 --> 12:28.281
Why do you think they're
letting me crack his chest?

12:32.319 --> 12:33.353
That thing's got
to wait outside.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.521
That "thing"
is a service animal.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.256
A service animal
with fleas.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.425
Actually, fleas have
a natural aversion to minis.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.193
Hey, Abby, Dilantin
level's back on...

12:40.227 --> 12:43.263
Carter, this is Mrs. Gelden
and her guide horse, Ruby.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.898
Who should be outside.

12:44.932 --> 12:45.999
We let seeing-eye
dogs in here.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.000
Our floors
are gonna be

12:47.034 --> 12:48.135
covered with
horse crap.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.402
She's housebroken.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.470
What if she spooks?

12:50.503 --> 12:51.939
Oh, we've been
on the El,

12:51.972 --> 12:53.240
airplanes, elevators.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.307
She can stay.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.276
Thank you.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.912
See you later, Ruby.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.152
Dr. Carter, Officer
Escobar's son is here.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.520
Okay, we're-we're still working
on his dad.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.456
The kid's anxious to see him.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.192
Let me... let me
go check for you.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.326
Thanks.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.230
No, we're too close
to the skull.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.231
Can you stop
the bleeding?

13:18.265 --> 13:19.232
Direct pressure for now.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.600
Got it.
Call Angio.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.070
Maybe we can balloon
the proximal carotid.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.905
They just picked up
his son at school.

13:24.938 --> 13:25.939
Arlo's here?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.040
How old is your son?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.176
15. I'm not his mother.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.944
Arlo's from Eddie's
first marriage.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.946
Fine. Throw down
a fresh drape.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.181
I'll be next door.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.049
RAY:
CVC's in.
Need a repeat chest.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.885
Hey, Arlo.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.419
It's not as bad
as it looks.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.221
It's okay.
You can come on up here.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.455
What is she
doing here?

13:42.489 --> 13:44.057
I want her out
right now.
Mom...

13:44.091 --> 13:46.093
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.194
Let's not get
into this.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.261
ARLO:
Mom, come on.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.329
You shouldn't
be here.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.463
Mom! Mom!
Get out!

13:50.497 --> 13:51.498
Can you just
shut up!

13:51.531 --> 13:53.066
Okay, everybody shut up.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.635
Officer, you and Mallory
need to step outside.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.337
I don't want
to leave him.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.371
Everyone gets to see him,

13:58.405 --> 13:59.606
just one at a time.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.608
Come on.

14:01.641 --> 14:02.910
LEWIS:
We're going to start
X rays on your father.

14:02.943 --> 14:05.145
You can say
hello quickly.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.179
Dad.

14:06.213 --> 14:07.214
It's Arlo.

14:07.247 --> 14:08.515
I'm here.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.350
He can't talk
with the tube in his mouth.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.954
You're going to
be all right.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.355
LEWIS:
Ray, take them
to the family room.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.024
RAY:
Me?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.391
You're tough, Dad.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.293
All right, honey.
That's enough.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.930
Dr. Barnett will answer
any questions you have.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.131
Okay, right
this way, guys.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.502
LEWIS:
Sam, check
a second hemocue.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.304
I think it's next door.
!
Yes.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.607
You got a rhythm?

14:34.641 --> 14:36.309
Units five and six are up.

14:36.343 --> 14:37.544
Hold compressions.

14:37.577 --> 14:38.578
Asystole.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.612
How's his volume?

14:39.646 --> 14:40.613
Heart's filling well.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.614
Too many holes.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.682
We could try high-dose epi.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.084
CARTER:
Penetrating trauma

14:44.117 --> 14:45.485
with no pulse
in the field.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.586
Okay.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.622
11:07.

14:51.524 --> 14:52.960
He's dead?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.394
Yeah.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.329
You just saved the taxpayers
a million bucks

14:56.363 --> 14:57.630
in trial fees and prison costs.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.467
What happened
to your wrist?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.102
Oh. I don't know.

15:02.135 --> 15:05.005
Neela, do you want to help
Officer McWayne out here?

15:05.038 --> 15:06.373
I was gonna
find some family...

15:06.406 --> 15:07.574
Why don't you get
Officer McWayne started

15:07.607 --> 15:09.409
in the suture room?

15:14.114 --> 15:16.216
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.218
Some people are freaked out
by little animals.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.586
I'm going to clean
your cut out.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.021
I have a cousin
who gets nervous

15:21.054 --> 15:23.323
around Chihuahuas.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.092
Is she wearing sneakers?

15:25.125 --> 15:27.660
Yes. It keeps her
from slipping on the floor.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.262
My husband wants her
transferred to Mercy.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.264
Surgery's on their way
down to check her out.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
We want to move her.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.534
You're gonna have
to find a surgeon at Mercy

15:34.567 --> 15:36.603
to accept her before
I can okay a transfer.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.672
Whoa, whoa!

15:39.706 --> 15:41.108
Hey! Hey!
Back off, Ruby.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.542
Doctor, can you
come to the phone?

15:42.575 --> 15:44.444
Yes. Just one minute, okay?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.179
I'll be right back.

15:46.213 --> 15:49.216
Re-prep the wound
and tie up the horse.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.251
It's my husband. He's driving
back from Detroit.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.021
Okay. Hi.
This is Dr. Lockhart...

15:54.021 --> 15:55.622
Yes, I am.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.656
( loud screaming )

15:56.689 --> 15:59.226
Mr. Trager...

15:59.259 --> 16:00.260
M-Mr. Trager.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.629
I-I understand.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.664
We will.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.034
Yes, your wife is working
on that right now.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.102
We-We would never do that, sir.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.570
I got paged about
a patient transfer?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.139
Wendall Meade,
Social Services.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.673
Okay, well, why...
Thank God
you're here.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.043
Sir, why don't you just
get here as soon as you can

16:16.076 --> 16:17.477
and we won't make
any decisions...

16:17.510 --> 16:18.678
( dial tone )

16:18.711 --> 16:20.213
Nice talking to you, too.

16:22.782 --> 16:27.187
Little pinprick...
and some burning.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.055
( groans )

16:28.088 --> 16:29.289
Sorry.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.357
Ow...

16:30.390 --> 16:31.524
Must be a pain
in the ass

16:31.558 --> 16:32.759
having to waste
all that time

16:32.792 --> 16:35.295
trying to save
a scumbag's life.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.365
He jacked
a mini-mart, doc.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.700
Looks like a 14-year-old.

16:44.271 --> 16:47.774
Feels like a foreign body.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.808
Something hard.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.077
Is it possible
you were shot?

16:50.110 --> 16:51.478
I don't think so.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.646
I remember I scraped
my wrist when I fell.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.252
How about there?

16:59.286 --> 17:00.753
Mm-mm. That's
a loop of bowel.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.655
I left messages for
three surgeons at Mercy.

17:02.689 --> 17:03.690
They'll call back.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.093
How long can we wait?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.527
ABBY:
Eight to ten hours.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.762
Hmm. I can't find
the appendix.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.431
What does that mean?

17:11.464 --> 17:14.501
Uh, usually if it's enlarged,
it's easy to find.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.801
So she may not
have appendicitis?

17:15.835 --> 17:17.503
Well, it's not
a perfect test.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.704
She could still
have the disease

17:18.738 --> 17:20.406
even if the ultrasound
is normal.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.109
Can't you people give
me a straight answer?

17:23.109 --> 17:25.412
I would say,
based on her fever
and tenderness

17:25.444 --> 17:26.779
that it is
appendicitis.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.147
Well, she said it
was the stomach flu,

17:28.181 --> 17:29.416
and then she
changed her mind.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.418
Now you can't
find her appendix?

17:31.451 --> 17:32.619
Transfer Center
from Mercy

17:32.652 --> 17:34.687
wants to talk
to the attending.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.156
Finally.

17:36.189 --> 17:38.291
Hang a gram
of cefotetan.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.432
Do you think
I need an operation?

17:47.634 --> 17:49.436
Do I need it soon?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.138
Yup.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.839
Can I have it here?

17:52.872 --> 17:54.307
Well, you could,

17:54.341 --> 17:56.443
but your parents
want you to have it

17:56.476 --> 17:58.145
at a different hospital.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.579
Won't that take a while?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414
Not too long.
It'll be okay.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.350
Why can't I decide?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.519
Because when you're a kid,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.288
your parents get to decide
what's best.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.859
The only way to stop
the bleeding right now

18:12.892 --> 18:14.827
is by blowing up
a balloon in
his artery.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.264
This X ray is
gonna guide us
to the right spot.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.798
How does he get blood
to his brain?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.234
Dr. Lewis?

18:21.268 --> 18:23.236
That's a good
question, Arlo.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.239
Two carotid arteries
supply the brain,

18:26.273 --> 18:28.175
right and left. Okay?

18:28.175 --> 18:31.511
If one gets blocked,
Mother Nature has a backup plan.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.847
It is called the
circle of Willis.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.683
It's a detour,

18:36.716 --> 18:39.186
but it allows the
blood from the right

18:39.219 --> 18:41.521
to get over to
the lefthand side.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.555
I understand.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.191
So, he can recover?

18:44.224 --> 18:46.893
Well, priority number one
is to stop the bleeding.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.695
If you're not wearing lead,
we need to ask you to leave.

18:48.728 --> 18:51.698
Okay I'll come get you
when we're done, all right?

18:51.731 --> 18:52.699
Thanks, Dr. Barnett.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.401
Ray is fine.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.568
Okay, Ray.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.603
FRANK:
Sam,

18:56.636 --> 18:57.637
Dr. Kovac called.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.306
Did you take
a message?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.509
Sounds like your kid got
suspended from school again.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.543
I may need
to leave.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.544
In a minute.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.612
Dr. Lewis...

19:05.645 --> 19:07.247
Have them
step outside.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.482
I removed a foreign body
from Officer McWayne's arm.

19:09.516 --> 19:10.517
What's that?

19:10.550 --> 19:11.718
Feels like a plastic BB.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.553
Could be what shot
your patient, as well.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.388
I don't think that's
enough to sever a
carotid artery.

19:15.422 --> 19:16.956
You sure?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.658
Officer Escobar
was shot with
this metal slug

19:18.691 --> 19:20.393
from the sub-Q, right
upper trapezius.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.694
Looks like
a nine-millimeter.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.296
Is that what the
suspect used?

19:23.330 --> 19:24.397
I don't think so.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.233
Nine-millimeter
semi-automatic,

19:26.233 --> 19:28.235
standard issue.
That's what we carry.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.273
KOVAC:
I can pick him up. It's not a
problem. Stay at work.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.974
SAM:
Well, what is it about?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.876
I don't know. The school
didn't tell me anything.

19:36.909 --> 19:37.944
What do you mean
they didn't tell you?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.579
What did he do?

19:39.612 --> 19:40.547
They just said, uh,
to come in for a meeting.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.914
Well, is he okay?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.650
Yeah, yeah, he's fine.
He's fine.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.651
All right. Well, just call me
as soon as you get back.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.386
I will.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.988
Okay. Thanks.
I have a tetanus shot
for Officer McWayne.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.390
Oh, uh, they're
being interviewed

19:50.423 --> 19:51.391
about the friendly
fire thing.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.459
Is it for sure now?

19:52.492 --> 19:53.693
Well, they found
a pellet gun

19:53.726 --> 19:54.894
next to the suspect
at the scene.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.296
So he didn't shoot the cop then?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.598
Guess not.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.503
Arlo, you should be
in the Family Room.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.507
Is that the guy
who shot my dad?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.243
He was the suspect
they were pursuing.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.378
Can I go in there?

20:11.411 --> 20:12.879
Probably not a good idea.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.347
I want to see him.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.549
Arlo...

20:19.919 --> 20:21.288
He's a kid.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.021
You don't have
to do this.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.256
Was he on drugs?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.023
I can't say.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.325
Did he have a police record?

20:25.358 --> 20:26.893
I don't know.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.795
Why would he do that?

20:28.828 --> 20:30.263
Why would he shoot my dad?

20:32.432 --> 20:35.935
Arlo, we're not exactly
sure who shot your dad.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.638
He may have been accidentally
shot by a police officer.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.006
What?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.474
But-But I thought he...

20:41.508 --> 20:42.875
This guy was only
carrying a BB gun.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.277
They won't
know for sure

20:44.311 --> 20:47.380
until the ballistics
tests are completed.

20:49.816 --> 20:51.384
Oh, man.

20:51.418 --> 20:54.654
One of his own guys?

20:54.687 --> 20:56.323
McWAYNE:
Arlo?

20:56.356 --> 20:57.790
Can we talk to you?

20:57.824 --> 21:00.327
Which one of you guys did it?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.694
We don't know
anything yet.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.396
Why don't we go and
sit down somewhere?

21:03.430 --> 21:05.031
We're sorry.
It's not
your fault.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.333
It comes with the job.

21:10.737 --> 21:14.341
There, our balloon is up,
and the vessel is occluded.

21:14.341 --> 21:15.808
Can we ask family in?

21:15.842 --> 21:16.909
Not just yet.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.945
Entrance wound is dry
as a bone.

21:18.978 --> 21:20.012
Nice.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.581
He's not
waking up.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.784
He's still comatose
with a flaccid paralysis

21:25.852 --> 21:26.953
and an upgoing toe.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.555
LEWIS:
So much for collateral flow.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.989
But you can repair
the carotid.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.958
DUBENKO:
Oh, it'd likely
do more harm

21:31.991 --> 21:35.495
than good. It's not a procedure
that I'm comfortable with.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.496
But if the wife consents...

21:36.529 --> 21:37.997
Uh, it's his fiancée.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.366
It's not her call then.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.367
We have an ex-wife.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.368
Is there a blood relative?

21:41.401 --> 21:43.102
Yeah, a son, but he's 15.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.604
Could he be a mature minor?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.506
A what?

21:46.539 --> 21:49.476
It's when a kid's mature enough
to make medical decisions.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.510
LEWIS:
Could be.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.544
Okay. I'll talk to him.

21:51.578 --> 21:52.879
LEWIS:
Get Wendall in

21:52.912 --> 21:54.781
on this, and, uh, find me
if you need me, okay?

21:54.814 --> 21:55.982
Okay.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.550
Dr. Dubenko, need
you right now.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.752
Uh, keep his crit above 30,
P02 90.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.855
Ten-year-old appy,
systolic's 60.

22:02.889 --> 22:03.956
She's septic?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.091
Antibiotics
are on board.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.393
We're running
in a liter.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.527
Who saw her from surgery?

22:07.560 --> 22:08.861
No one. Family wants her
transferred.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.530
That isn't
happening.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.131
Dr. Hong
at Mercy accepted her.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.666
Pressure's up
to 70 with 500.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.067
They're sending
an ambulance.

22:15.101 --> 22:17.837
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Your daughter is very sick.

22:17.870 --> 22:20.039
She needs surgery right now.
Do we have consent?

22:20.072 --> 22:22.074
No. She said
we could wait.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.075
In most cases
we could.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.444
This is unusual.

22:24.477 --> 22:25.812
The infection spread
to her bloodstream

22:25.845 --> 22:27.414
very quickly.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Trager.

22:27.414 --> 22:28.648
We need your consent
for surgery.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.116
My husband will be here
any minute.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.784
We don't
have time.
I need to wait for him.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.053
It's life-threatening.

22:35.422 --> 22:36.889
Okay. We'll "double doctor" it.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.525
Wha... What?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.427
Two physician signatures
can override your consent.

22:40.427 --> 22:41.628
Well...

22:41.661 --> 22:43.730
Sign it.
Sign it. Let's go.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.698
This is not
what we agreed on.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.099
I'm sorry.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.134
I've never done
this before.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.669
No one gets in trouble

22:49.702 --> 22:51.871
for acting in the best interest
of the patient.

22:51.904 --> 22:55.074
Tell that to
Dr. Corday.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.009
...treating your...

22:57.043 --> 22:58.445
Sorry, I was tied up.

22:58.445 --> 22:59.879
Everyone,
this is Wendall Meade.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.515
Hi, Arlo.
C-Can he stay?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.884
If it's okay with Arlo.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.886
Yeah?

23:06.919 --> 23:09.155
Okay. So, the two treatment
options.

23:09.188 --> 23:10.957
We can use a catheter

23:10.990 --> 23:12.925
to plug up the artery
with coils.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.461
Like with the balloon?

23:14.461 --> 23:17.864
Yeah, and that
would give him a 15% chance

23:17.897 --> 23:19.031
of getting better.

23:19.065 --> 23:23.803
85% chance of still staying
in a coma.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.873
Or we can do surgery
to reconnect the artery.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.677
If we do that, that would give
him 30% chance of improving.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.044
That's a
little better.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.780
Yeah, well, it's risky.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.916
Usually with surgery, half the
time the patient deteriorates

23:36.949 --> 23:38.017
or dies.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.887
The surgery sounds too risky.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.890
WENDALL:
Do you understand
the choices, Arlo?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.592
They both kind of suck.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.662
Can you explain them
back to me?

23:49.696 --> 23:51.197
What?

23:51.230 --> 23:53.500
I need to make sure that he
understands the options.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.967
I'll make sure he does.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.069
Arlo?

23:57.103 --> 23:59.639
Well, if we play it safe,

23:59.672 --> 24:01.808
there's a small chance
he gets better.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.678
If we do the surgery,

24:05.712 --> 24:07.146
there's a bigger chance
that he'll improve,

24:07.179 --> 24:10.116
but an even bigger risk
that he'll get sicker.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.819
That's right.

24:12.852 --> 24:13.786
It's your call.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.723
What are you
talking about?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.057
We've decided
that Arlo's a mature minor.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.626
He can make the decision.

24:19.659 --> 24:20.860
BENITA:
By himself?
He can't

24:20.893 --> 24:21.894
handle this.
Yes, I can.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.095
No, you can't.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.631
You're 15 years old.
He's my dad.

24:24.664 --> 24:25.898
In cases like this,
the decision has to be made

24:25.932 --> 24:28.134
by a blood relative.
It's the law.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.236
How can this be right?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.844
Between you and me,
it's not the end of the world,

24:37.877 --> 24:40.179
but the school board
has a zero tolerance approach

24:40.212 --> 24:43.082
to what they consider
pornographic.

24:43.115 --> 24:44.984
What?!

24:45.017 --> 24:49.221
He brought this to school.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.623
He was showing it
to the other kids.

24:50.657 --> 24:52.559
That might not
be appropriate.

24:54.727 --> 24:57.830
They have lots of cool
electronic gadgets in here.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.600
I don't think they were looking
at the gadgets.

25:00.633 --> 25:02.669
That your name
on the mailing label?

25:02.702 --> 25:04.971
Yeah.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.839
And you're
Alex's stepfather?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.708
Not exactly.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.643
I see.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.945
But you take an active role
in the child-rearing.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.214
Yeah, I pick him up from school,
and we, uh, do sports.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.248
I took him fishing...

25:16.282 --> 25:17.917
That's great.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.587
Alex and his mom, we'll
been all living together.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.288
It's going well.

25:22.321 --> 25:23.923
And how long has that
been the arrangement?

25:27.660 --> 25:29.862
About a week.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.735
Ray, do-do-do-do you
have a minute?

25:35.768 --> 25:38.938
Hey. Hot chocolate?
It's my treat.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.607
I'm really sorry
about my mom.

25:42.975 --> 25:43.943
Look, she's just
looking out for you, okay?

25:43.976 --> 25:45.945
By freaking out?!

25:45.978 --> 25:47.880
My dad's lucky that she won't
even talk to him anymore.

25:50.883 --> 25:54.286
You okay with
what we talked about?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.622
About your dad.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.060
Last year, for the
ninth grade prom,

26:01.093 --> 26:02.094
there was this girl Sarah.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.095
Yeah?

26:03.129 --> 26:05.164
I was too afraid
to ask her.

26:05.197 --> 26:08.067
But my dad told me that
you gotta take chances,
or you miss out.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.237
She was already going
with this guy from
the baseball team.

26:11.270 --> 26:14.674
Two weeks later, she
asked me to go to a
concert on the pier.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.110
Sounds like your dad's
a pretty cool guy.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.746
He'd want the surgery.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.850
Okay, then
that's what we'll do.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.151
But my mom's gonna
freak out...

26:25.184 --> 26:26.285
It's your decision.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.354
And I'll back you up.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.022
You will?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.992
Sure thing.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.394
Abdominal pain
and near-syncope
from hypotension.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.897
He was here this morning.
Dr. Pratt's patient.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.331
Marina, find Pratt and
grab the ultrasound.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.768
He thought it was a bruise.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.102
When did you get dizzy?

26:43.135 --> 26:44.103
A few hours ago.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.304
Why didn't you come back?

26:45.337 --> 26:46.973
Doctor said
it wasn't serious.

26:47.006 --> 26:48.675
Pressure's only 80 palp.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.409
Trendelenberg,
a liter of saline.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.911
CBC, type and
cross for 4.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.312
Sir, where
does it hurt?

26:53.345 --> 26:54.947
Sonosite.
What's up?

26:54.981 --> 26:57.216
You sent home
an unstable patient.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.719
Damn. He lacerated
his spleen.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.253
Call surgery.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.690
Dr. Pratt...

27:03.690 --> 27:04.991
I signed off
on this guy.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.358
Hey, he was just rolling
around with his nephew.

27:06.392 --> 27:08.027
You didn't
mention belly pain.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.028
He didn't have any.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.930
Did you even
check a crit?

27:10.963 --> 27:11.998
It would've been normal.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.866
His shoulder was hurting?

27:13.900 --> 27:15.201
Yeah, but there was
no point tenderness...

27:15.234 --> 27:16.736
Free blood irritates
the diaphragm

27:16.769 --> 27:18.170
and gives you referred
shoulder pain.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.906
You missed it because
you forgot about Kerr's sign.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.340
No, we missed it

27:21.373 --> 27:23.342
because you were too tired
to see the patient.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.849
So what did the principal say?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.720
Why can't you tell me now?

27:35.054 --> 27:37.757
All right, okay,
when I get home.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.726
Arlo's consenting for surgery.
It's all taken care of.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.760
And you called it in?

27:40.793 --> 27:41.861
Vascular's ready for him.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.029
Okay.

27:43.062 --> 27:44.330
I'll sort the pre-op list.

27:44.363 --> 27:45.998
All right. I have to go pump
before I explode.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.801
Carolyn made it to the OR.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.802
Who?

27:49.836 --> 27:50.803
Appendix girl.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.805
Great.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.406
You're busy today.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.142
Declared a 15-year-old
a mature minor,

27:56.175 --> 27:58.277
overrode parental consent
on an appy...

27:58.310 --> 28:00.980
And took a kid away
from abusive parents.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.248
It's the triple crown
of social work.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.251
When are you off?

28:05.284 --> 28:07.086
Another hour.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.355
Want to get some dinner?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.090
Thanks. I have
plans already.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.260
Not-Not with anyone,
if that's what
you're wondering.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.428
Not a problem.

28:16.462 --> 28:20.032
You could come along,
but I have to warn you,
it's pretty physical.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.034
Oh, yeah?

28:22.068 --> 28:25.171
Dr. Carter, Neuro's
admitting my CVA in Four.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.207
Thanks.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.043
Abby, that's two
to sign out.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.244
It's 7:05.
I know.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.180
I've been here
five minutes too long.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.982
Stroke patient, tele admit,

28:36.015 --> 28:37.516
and a cop Dubenko's
sending to surgery.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.851
You've still got
three on the board.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.352
I know.
They're all discharged.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.357
Anyway, you
forgot something.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.392
Abby, what?

28:46.425 --> 28:47.459
Ow!

28:47.493 --> 28:49.495
Your flu shot.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.496
You're welcome!

28:52.799 --> 28:55.234
Pressure's good.
122/76.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.003
You feeling better,
Mr. Sakabu?

28:57.036 --> 28:58.971
Yes, thank you
very much.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.840
Okay if the nephew
comes back?

29:00.873 --> 29:04.476
Yeah, sure. We might be able
to get more history.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.945
Are you on, uh,
any medication?

29:05.978 --> 29:06.979
SAKABU:
No.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.114
Any allergies?

29:08.147 --> 29:10.316
Uh-uh.
How could this happen?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.551
It's a very unusual
presentation.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.888
You need enough force to break
a rib that cuts into the spleen.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.489
My nephew's
a pretty tough kid.

29:17.523 --> 29:20.426
He'd have to be to cause
something like this.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.030
My uncle going
to be okay?

29:29.201 --> 29:30.269
Hey, have you seen Susan?

29:30.302 --> 29:32.404
She signed out.
Oh, great.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.440
Uh, no, just page her
again for me, please.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.842
What do you need?

29:35.842 --> 29:37.476
I cannot believe Ray
dumped this on me.

29:37.509 --> 29:38.911
I'm supposed to be taking
care of this cop's kid.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.279
I have no idea
what's going on.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.848
He signed out to you?
Why would he do that?

29:41.848 --> 29:44.250
I was in his exit
path to the door.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.985
Dr. Lockhart,
this is Keith Trager.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.353
Daughter has appendicitis.

29:47.386 --> 29:49.188
Right. Hi. Uh, we
spoke on the phone...

29:49.221 --> 29:51.023
Where is she?
Her condition worsened

29:51.057 --> 29:52.224
and we had to take
her up to surgery.

29:52.258 --> 29:53.592
Okay, you were supposed
to transfer her.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.394
I know.
There wasn't time for that, sir.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.428
Take me to her, now.

29:56.462 --> 29:57.496
Okay, just
one second.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.198
There's a problem
with Arlo?

29:59.231 --> 30:02.001
Ray said it was
all settled, but
he's very upset.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.402
I know the case.
You want me to take it?

30:03.435 --> 30:04.603
Can you? Thank you.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.972
TRAGER:
Excuse me...!

30:06.005 --> 30:06.939
LOCKHART:
Yeah, I'm coming.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.507
Arlo...

30:08.540 --> 30:09.541
Where's Ray?

30:09.575 --> 30:10.542
He had to leave.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.610
When's he coming back?

30:11.643 --> 30:12.845
Actually, he left
for the night.

30:12.879 --> 30:13.846
He left?!

30:13.880 --> 30:15.347
I'm sure I can help.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.349
He promised me he would
help me talk to my mom.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.352
I can do that.

30:41.407 --> 30:42.942
Oh, my God.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.376
They're doing the operation
through the scope,

30:44.410 --> 30:46.512
which means a smaller scar
and shorter recovery.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.347
So... sh-she's okay?

30:48.380 --> 30:49.581
It's not a complicated
procedure.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.985
Everything's fine,
Keith.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.386
Who's that operating?

30:54.420 --> 30:58.490
That's the Chief of Surgery.
He's the best.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.459
DUBENKO ( over speaker ):
Up on the Bovie.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.361
Dr. Dubenko,
the parents are here.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.462
Oh, she's doing great.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.431
We caught it before it burst.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.365
( alarm beeping )

31:06.398 --> 31:07.366
What's that?

31:07.399 --> 31:08.968
Pulse ox probe slipped off.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.036
Everything's fine.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.272
You know, I brought my dad
here for back surgery.

31:13.305 --> 31:14.573
He never left.

31:14.606 --> 31:16.675
Well, that's not going
to happen.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.144
He died on the table.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.212
Some junior doc
botched the job.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.448
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.619
I hate this hospital.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.293
Where's the other doc?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.494
Dr. Barnett
isn't available.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.596
He took off.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.032
So, Arlo, have you decided
on which treatment

31:40.066 --> 31:42.401
you would like us
to pursue?

31:55.547 --> 31:58.317
I want him to have
the operation.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.086
BENITA:
It's too risky, honey.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.054
It's what he'd want.

32:02.088 --> 32:03.455
Isn't it better to have him
around, even if he's sick,

32:03.489 --> 32:04.556
than to lose him forever?

32:04.590 --> 32:05.591
You should listen
to you mother...

32:05.624 --> 32:07.126
Why does he have
to be in here?

32:07.159 --> 32:08.160
He's your father's
best friend.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.062
I feel bad, too!

32:10.096 --> 32:11.163
I don't even know why we're
still talking about this!

32:11.197 --> 32:12.431
Ray said
it was my decision!

32:12.464 --> 32:13.465
What, you don't
want my opinion?!

32:13.499 --> 32:16.002
No!

32:16.002 --> 32:18.470
Tell her.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.139
Legally,
Arlo has the right...

32:20.172 --> 32:22.008
He's too young.
No, I'm not!

32:22.041 --> 32:23.642
Don't talk to your
mother like that!

32:23.675 --> 32:25.011
Maybe if I reviewed
the cases one more...

32:25.044 --> 32:27.579
No! I understood it
the first time!

32:30.282 --> 32:32.051
Dad would want to go for it.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.020
BENITA:
I know that's how
he always talked.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.454
He liked to take
chances.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.756
That's what probably
got him shot!

32:37.789 --> 32:40.026
Look, we're not going
to make any progress...

32:40.059 --> 32:41.427
I want him to have
the operation.

32:41.460 --> 32:44.763
If you approve
this surgery...

32:44.796 --> 32:47.033
how are you going
to feel if he dies?

32:47.033 --> 32:48.267
He's not gonna die.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.102
He could die.

32:50.136 --> 32:54.073
Are you ready to
live with that?

32:54.106 --> 32:55.741
I'm trying
to protect you.

32:55.774 --> 32:59.378
I know you think
you're all grown up.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.713
Are you ready to
accept responsibility

33:01.747 --> 33:03.682
for your father's death?

33:07.419 --> 33:09.688
( sighs )

33:09.721 --> 33:11.657
Yeah, hey, Marie, it's Dr. Chen.

33:11.690 --> 33:12.858
How's he doing?

33:12.891 --> 33:15.561
Uh, okay, well, go ahead and
push another two of Ativan.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.732
Yeah. Listen, um, any chance
you can work late tonight?

33:20.766 --> 33:23.469
Yeah, we're getting slammed
and, uh, I don't think

33:23.502 --> 33:25.637
I'm gonna be able
to get home till 2:00 a.m.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.139
That would be great.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.475
Thank you... yeah,
thank you so much.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.177
Okay, bye.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.379
Hey.
Hey.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.646
Sorry about
Uncle Sumo's spleen.

33:34.680 --> 33:38.317
Yeah, well,
we caught it in time.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.619
Who knew his nephew
was the size of a Hummer?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.488
( chuckles )

33:42.521 --> 33:44.356
Didn't mean to snap
at you earlier.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.358
No, no, I was the Attending.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.659
I should've seen him.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.461
So who's the potassium for?

33:51.530 --> 33:52.531
My dad.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.568
You know, you gotta go easy
on that stuff.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.538
Of course.
40 a day, for his diarrhea.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.773
This should last me a few weeks.

34:12.684 --> 34:13.719
Hey.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.353
Hey.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.422
That's a big wall.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.123
Yeah, I'm in training.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.492
For what, taking down PCPers?

34:20.525 --> 34:22.328
Triathlon.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.362
Hey, Wendy.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.463
Hey, Brett.
This is John.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.496
Hi.

34:25.531 --> 34:26.864
First time?

34:26.898 --> 34:28.800
Nah, I did this once

34:28.833 --> 34:30.202
when I was a kid.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.603
All right, thanks.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.772
Take good care of him.
See you at the top.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.774
Let's go over
to the beginner wall.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.744
Is this how this this thing
is supposed to go?

34:38.777 --> 34:41.612
Sure, if you want to hang
upside down by your balls.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.492
What's going on?

34:53.525 --> 34:55.661
The family decided not
to have the surgery.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.163
The family?

34:57.163 --> 34:58.164
We've been together
for three years.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.465
Don't I get any say in this?

34:59.498 --> 35:01.733
Hello, this is
Dr. Rasgotra in the ER.

35:01.767 --> 35:05.871
We're canceling the carotid
surgery on patient Escobar.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.373
Yes,
I can hold.

35:26.525 --> 35:27.493
Hey, John.

35:27.526 --> 35:28.860
Hi.

35:28.894 --> 35:30.329
So you two
are dating, huh?

35:30.362 --> 35:31.663
Nah, we're
just friends.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.199
Well, that's how it starts.

35:33.232 --> 35:35.301
We went out for a year or two.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.769
Oh, yeah? Great.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.505
I thought we might
even get married.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.806
Then one day she tells me

35:40.839 --> 35:42.474
she wants to start
seeing other people.

35:42.508 --> 35:46.278
Why do they
say that?

35:46.312 --> 35:48.847
If you want to break up,
you should just do it.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.917
Is the rope supposed
to be this loose?

35:51.950 --> 35:53.219
Better?

35:53.219 --> 35:55.787
Yeah, thanks.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.755
( grunting )

35:59.758 --> 36:01.360
Hey.
Hey.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.661
Did you get
back to sleep?

36:02.694 --> 36:03.795
No, not really.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.896
Sorry.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.304
Okay, where's Alex?

36:12.338 --> 36:14.806
Up in his room.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.775
Want a beer?

36:16.808 --> 36:19.378
Do I need one?

36:19.411 --> 36:22.514
He brought this to school.

36:22.548 --> 36:26.352
That's it?

36:26.385 --> 36:28.687
That's such crap.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.423
Where'd he get it?

36:31.457 --> 36:33.659
You subscribe?

36:33.692 --> 36:35.527
I like the articles.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.396
Oh, please.

36:37.429 --> 36:41.300
So listen, anyway, uh...

36:41.333 --> 36:46.505
a friend of his had the magazine
in the bathroom.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.275
In the stall.

36:49.308 --> 36:52.411
At school...

36:52.444 --> 36:55.314
You know,
the kid was...

36:58.850 --> 37:00.286
Are you kidding me?

37:03.589 --> 37:05.491
Oh, my God.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.295
Do you think
that Alex is?

37:13.332 --> 37:16.402
I thought it would be
at least a year or two

37:16.435 --> 37:18.337
until I had to deal with this.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.447
Well, I guess I need
to talk to him.

37:28.480 --> 37:31.317
Yup.

37:32.684 --> 37:33.685
So I'm here
twice a week.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.053
Any time you want
to join me?

37:35.086 --> 37:36.388
Yeah, that'd be great.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.556
Brett could give you
another lesson.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.990
Oh, he's quite a teacher.

37:39.024 --> 37:39.991
Hey, see you
next time.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.627
Bye.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.794
I've got an outfit just
like that at home,

37:42.828 --> 37:44.930
but I didn't want
to show off.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.765
So, are you hungry?

37:46.798 --> 37:49.968
Um, no. No, not really.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.970
You got to eat dinner.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.340
I think I'm just going
to grab something at home.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.343
Come on, you've been
a good sport, my treat.

37:57.376 --> 38:01.012
Okay.

38:01.046 --> 38:04.616
So what are you
in the mood for?

38:04.650 --> 38:06.485
I don't know.

38:06.518 --> 38:08.754
Indian? No.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.822
Chinese?

38:10.856 --> 38:13.359
Uh... sushi?

38:13.359 --> 38:14.826
Had it for lunch.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.027
What about
deep dish pizza?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.596
I could go for pizza.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.498
I know a really good
pizza place over on...

38:19.531 --> 38:20.466
Yeah, too
many carbs.

38:20.499 --> 38:22.434
Right.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.736
Hey, I have an idea.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.775
Okay, close your eyes.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.078
Pick a page and point.

38:33.111 --> 38:35.481
That's where we go.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.848
What if it's
a donut shop?

38:36.882 --> 38:38.784
Are you in this or not?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.022
There?

38:44.055 --> 38:46.024
Not there.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.493
All right,
right there.

38:47.526 --> 38:48.827
And the winner is...

38:48.860 --> 38:51.530
Uncle Vito's
Mongolian Barbecue.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.831
What's that?

38:52.864 --> 38:54.533
Um, it's Italian.

38:54.566 --> 38:57.603
It's Asian.
It's maybe Southern.

38:57.636 --> 38:58.804
All right, close your eyes
and do it again.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.872
No, no, you
made the rules.

39:00.906 --> 39:04.476
Mongolian barbecue?

39:04.510 --> 39:05.644
Yeah, but it's
in Downer's Grove.

39:05.677 --> 39:06.845
We don't go that far.

39:06.878 --> 39:10.549
Well, are you
in this or not?

39:10.582 --> 39:12.651
All right.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.753
I hope they have tofu.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.967
Officer McWayne.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.837
They're moving him
up to the ICU.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.473
Okay, um... thank you.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.846
Arlo!

39:41.980 --> 39:43.449
Arlo!
It's okay.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.916
Where's he going?

39:44.950 --> 39:47.118
Probably just getting
a snack across the street.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.454
He seems really upset.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.988
It'll pass.

39:50.021 --> 39:52.123
Well, maybe I should
go and talk to him.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.759
No, he's too emotional.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.495
You can't talk to him
when he gets this way.

39:56.528 --> 40:00.499
I hope he doesn't feel like
he was forced into this.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.668
Are you sure you don't want
to think about it some more?

40:02.701 --> 40:04.135
Maybe discuss it with him
after he calms down.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.037
It won't help.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.773
He's not being realistic.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.675
That's why we had to make
the decision for him.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.142
He's too
confused.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.179
I heard him express
a strong opinion more than once.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.782
You and I both know
it was the wrong choice.

40:16.815 --> 40:20.652
He was hoping for something
that's never going to happen.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.654
He loves his father,
but I'm the one

40:22.688 --> 40:25.591
who has
to set limits.

40:25.624 --> 40:29.995
Anyway, thanks
for everything you did.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.931
I'm not sure I helped.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.666
When you let us
work it out together,

40:34.700 --> 40:36.868
you did the right thing.

40:44.175 --> 40:45.210
( knocking )

40:45.243 --> 40:46.244
Yeah?

40:46.277 --> 40:49.915
Hey, can I come in?

40:56.121 --> 40:57.723
I didn't know
you liked The Goon.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.491
They didn't
have Hellboy.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.196
So look, uh,
about today at school...

41:05.230 --> 41:07.265
Mr. Elmore is such a loser.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.168
Yeah, uh...

41:10.201 --> 41:13.572
What happened with that
kid in the bathroom...

41:13.605 --> 41:16.041
I just wanted
to make sure

41:16.074 --> 41:17.809
you didn't have
any questions.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.745
About what?

41:19.778 --> 41:23.749
You know, about
what he was doing.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.083
Spanking the monkey?

41:27.252 --> 41:29.020
Yeah.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.756
What about it?

41:30.789 --> 41:35.827
Well, it's normal, but...

41:35.861 --> 41:40.031
it's not the kind of thing
you should do at school.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.701
You think I'm stupid?

41:42.734 --> 41:47.873
At your age, it can be
a confusing time.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.641
If you ever
want to,

41:49.675 --> 41:51.743
you can always talk
to me about these things.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.045
Okay.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.650
Okay. Good night.

42:09.695 --> 42:10.929
RAY:
So I heard
there was

42:10.962 --> 42:12.297
an after-hours club
at the Crowbar.

42:12.330 --> 42:13.298
Cool.

42:13.331 --> 42:14.666
Have you
seen Kristy?

42:14.700 --> 42:17.703
Yeah, she's pulling
around the side.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.070
Hey, you're late.

42:19.104 --> 42:20.238
We went on
at 9:00.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.173
How could you just
leave like that?

42:22.207 --> 42:24.676
I'll meet you
in the car.

42:24.710 --> 42:26.077
I'm sorry. What?

42:26.111 --> 42:28.013
You abandoned that kid.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.116
I signed out my patients
when my shift was over.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.618
To Abby-- you should
have signed out to me.

42:32.618 --> 42:34.152
I knew the case.
You were busy.

42:34.185 --> 42:35.220
You thought it
was quick and easy.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.321
Well, it got complicated, Ray.

42:36.354 --> 42:37.956
How did it
get complicated?

42:37.989 --> 42:39.825
The kid wanted his dad
to have surgery.

42:39.858 --> 42:41.793
Well, how long did you discuss
it with him, two minutes?

42:41.827 --> 42:42.928
He understood
everything.

42:42.961 --> 42:44.963
His dad's not having
the surgery.

42:44.996 --> 42:45.964
Why not?

42:45.997 --> 42:47.365
Because you weren't there.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.836
His mom gave him a hard time
about it and he gave in.

42:50.869 --> 42:51.903
Did you at least
talk to them?

42:51.937 --> 42:53.872
Yes.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.107
Well, all he needed was a little
hand-holding, Neela.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.276
I mean, God, is that
so hard for you?

42:58.309 --> 42:59.645
Don't turn this around
to make it about me.

42:59.678 --> 43:00.646
You promised to help him.

43:00.679 --> 43:02.681
No, I told
him...

43:02.714 --> 43:05.884
It's not my job, or anyone
else's, to keep your promises.

43:05.917 --> 43:06.952
My shift was over.

43:06.985 --> 43:07.953
He was counting on you.

43:07.986 --> 43:09.320
I had a gig.

43:09.354 --> 43:12.658
Screw your gig.
Medicine isn't a day job.

43:12.658 --> 43:13.925
This coming from a girl

43:13.959 --> 43:16.227
who was selling hot dogs
three months ago?

43:16.261 --> 43:19.264
I was off at 7:00.
Abby was off at 7:00.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.867
But we were still there
taking care of our patients.

43:21.900 --> 43:23.869
You know what, we would never
leave the hospital

43:23.902 --> 43:25.937
if we had to stick around
to tuck in every patient.

43:25.971 --> 43:27.338
I'm not talking
about every patient.

43:27.372 --> 43:28.974
I'm talking about one kid.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.309
It was the most important
decision of his life.

43:31.342 --> 43:34.179
He trusted you, and you left.
