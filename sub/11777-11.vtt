04:25.264 --> 04:26.057
We begin
with the Flash Challenge.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.685
This week,
we're testing precision,

04:29.936 --> 04:32.772
specifically, how exact
you are with your lines,

04:32.855 --> 04:34.941
shading, and small details.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.025
One drop of ink
in the wrong spot

04:36.109 --> 04:39.404
can take your tattoo
from greatness to disaster.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.572
{\an8}Precision is crucial.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.867
You do one line wrong
and you change the whole tattoo.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.495
There really is no better way
to test precision

04:47.578 --> 04:48.621
than with a mini tattoo.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.582
Ugh, [bleep].

04:51.666 --> 04:54.460
Mini tattoos
require surgical precision

04:54.544 --> 04:55.712
and a single needle.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.755
You must have a steady hand.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.507
{\an8}With a micro tattoo,
any mistake you make

04:59.590 --> 05:02.552
{\an8}is gonna look huge, and
this is gonna be a tough day.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.722
It just so happens that
one of Oliver's specialties

05:05.805 --> 05:07.140
is mini tattoos.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.643
In fact, Oliver just finished
a mini tattoo

05:10.727 --> 05:12.979
of one of
the most iconic logos,

05:13.062 --> 05:14.772
a logo that
has had more history

05:14.856 --> 05:17.316
and heritage than most:
The Jagermeister logo.

05:21.654 --> 05:24.949
There's nothing better
to test precision than logos.

05:25.033 --> 05:25.950
They test everything
in your arsenal:

05:26.034 --> 05:28.953
Straight lines,
perfect circles.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.955
Jagermeister
was originally developed

05:31.039 --> 05:32.457
for hunters that have
a deep connection

05:32.540 --> 05:36.085
and strong bond to their craft
and each other.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.671
Jagermeister's
proudest symbol

05:38.755 --> 05:41.215
has always been
the St. Hubertus Stag,

05:41.299 --> 05:43.843
prominently placed
at the center of the label.

05:43.926 --> 05:44.761
For today's
Flash Challenge,

05:44.844 --> 05:46.596
you must tattoo
the Jagermeister logo

05:46.679 --> 05:51.017
the same size or smaller
than Oliver just tattooed it.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.769
{\an5}-Ooh!

05:51.100 --> 05:52.769
-Oh.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.065
{\an8}What would be better
than to beat the one person

05:57.148 --> 06:00.318
who has been giving you [bleep]
this whole ride?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.737
You will have 60 minutes.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.821
It took me
about a half hour

06:03.905 --> 06:06.699
to complete this quarter-sized
Jagermeister logo.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.326
We're gonna give the
artists at least an hour,

06:08.409 --> 06:10.453
{\an8}which I think
is pretty fair.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.287
Go get to your stations,
set up,

06:11.370 --> 06:13.915
and we'll
bring in your canvases.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.003
Today,
we're testing precision,

06:19.087 --> 06:20.713
{\an8}and the object
of the game here

06:20.797 --> 06:22.590
is to pull off the outline
with the shading

06:22.673 --> 06:24.300
extremely clean, legible,
and very precise.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.135
Oliver's been doing this
for a while,

06:26.219 --> 06:28.596
so let's see
what these kids got.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.099
All right,
so go ahead, sit down.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.059
I'll go right about here.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.727
You want it on your wrist?

06:34.811 --> 06:35.978
I'll put it
right above that.

06:36.062 --> 06:36.854
I don't know.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.981
{\an5}-Come on.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.981
-No. No, not there. No.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.650
Doing these lines
and keeping

06:40.733 --> 06:42.568
these elements of this thing
at that scale,

06:42.652 --> 06:45.738
{\an8}your technical precision
has to be at the absolute Max.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.365
First tattoo? Oh, [bleep].

06:47.448 --> 06:48.199
When I hear
that we're doing precision,

06:48.282 --> 06:50.493
{\an8}I think
the next couple challenges

06:50.576 --> 06:52.161
{\an8}are gonna be either
portrait or realism.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.705
Those definitely
aren't my strong points.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.666
I think this part right here
would be a good spot.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.750
If there's any time that I need

06:57.834 --> 06:59.001
to win a Flash Challenge,
it's now.

06:59.085 --> 06:59.460
I think we're ready.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.882
Oh, precision, straight lines.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.343
I just had a big coffee,
so this ought to work out great.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.803
Oliver showed off doing
this tattoo, and doing it clean.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.055
Oh, yeah.

07:11.139 --> 07:11.931
{\an8}So I'm like,
"all right, [bleep],

07:12.014 --> 07:13.891
{\an8}I can do it smaller
and cleaner."

07:13.975 --> 07:14.976
Bam! Awesome.

07:15.059 --> 07:18.396
Good enough does not exist
in my [bleep] world.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.984
Steve is getting to be
a little over-confident.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.735
Oh, that's some old-school
[bleep] right there.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.363
{\an8}He's going smaller
than Oliver's size,

07:27.446 --> 07:29.991
and I kind of want
to challenge him,

07:30.074 --> 07:33.536
so I think I'm gonna follow
Steve's idea and do it smaller.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.830
How low can you go?

07:35.913 --> 07:38.541
You're going down.
The smallest I ever tattooed,

07:38.624 --> 07:39.792
mine's half that size.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.210
I will not let you
win this challenge.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.628
This is [bleep] awesome.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.964
{\an8}Sweetheart,
like, what are you doing?

07:50.052 --> 07:51.888
{\an8}Oliver picked that size
for a reason,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.515
and anybody who tries
to do it smaller to beat him

07:54.599 --> 07:57.602
is gonna end up
shooting themselves in the leg.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.978

so I'm not able get

08:15.870 --> 08:17.121

from the stencil.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.165

08:35.222 --> 08:36.432
the bottle,
instead of the artwork,

'cause the Jagermeister logo
on the bottle is more detailed.

Not as much
as I thought it would.

09:04.543 --> 09:06.254
{\an8}One thing that I'm kinda
struggling with

09:06.337 --> 09:07.213
is working
this single needle.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.882
These little lines
are killers.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.842
I feel like
I'm pulling a straight line,

09:11.926 --> 09:13.719
but then I'm not as confident
that it looks

09:13.803 --> 09:14.971
as straight
as it should be.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.348
It's crazy, like,
you'll move one single thing

09:17.431 --> 09:19.475
and that could, like,
make such a big difference.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.894
Five minutes to go,
everybody.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.065
{\an5}-Looking good.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.065
-Thanks, bud.

09:26.148 --> 09:26.565
We're almost done.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.861
Hot damn.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.071
Let's see the super tiny.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.159
{\an8}Sarah is really struggling.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.161
That is one small-ass tattoo.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.997
Her line work
looks a little wobbly.

09:41.080 --> 09:41.956
Mine is the cleanest, by far.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.125
Looks perfect.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.544
When I made my stencil,
I was doing it the right size

09:46.627 --> 09:47.878
to keep the detail
in this thing,

09:47.962 --> 09:49.797
{\an8}and the fact that Steve
went a little smaller,

09:49.880 --> 09:50.673
definitely ambitious,
or maybe

09:50.756 --> 09:52.466
he just doesn't have
a good strategy.

09:52.550 --> 09:53.384
We'll see.

09:53.467 --> 10:00.349
And 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,

10:00.433 --> 10:04.395
4, 3, 2, 1.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.690
That's it.
Machines down. No more ink.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.733
Want to stand up
real quick?

10:08.816 --> 10:10.109
{\an5}-Let me just see how that looks.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.109
{\an3}-Sure.

10:10.901 --> 10:11.944
Well, that's not gonna work.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.530
Sarah went a little bit
smaller than everybody else.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.908
I want to do more.
I'm like, "mmm."

10:17.992 --> 10:19.618
Probably not the smartest
choice in this situation.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.163
Wasn't as easy
as you thought, was it?

10:22.246 --> 10:24.206
[sighs]

10:24.290 --> 10:25.374
{\an5}-Jesse, how you doing, bud?

10:24.290 --> 10:25.374
-Good.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.793
Smallest tattoo
I've ever done.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.171
I got a whole new respect
for you now, for sure.

10:30.254 --> 10:32.214
Very precise,
super clean line work.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.799
We all know
a circle's a [bleep].

10:33.883 --> 10:35.343
{\an5}-You nailed it.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.343
-Thank you.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.218
Steve, how you doing?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.553
{\an8}Smaller than Oliver's.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.264
The thicker line
on the outside of the cross

10:40.348 --> 10:41.891
is not as thick
as the bottom of the cross,

10:41.974 --> 10:45.019
but as far as the size you did,
execution is pretty nice.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.730
It really looks
exactly like the photo.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.732
{\an8}So in terms
of Steve versus Oliver,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.984
{\an8}-who you gonna give it to?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.984
{\an8}-It's a toss-up.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.235
{\an5}-Thanks, Steve.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.235
-Very impressive.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.279
Tatu Baby.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.073
Precision is a little off.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.033
Some of the lines
touch the antlers.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.534
If you pay attention
to the reference,

11:00.618 --> 11:02.078
none of the lines
actually touch.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.704
{\an8}If I had to put you
versus Oliver, Oliver wins.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.084
Sebastian.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.377
{\an8}-Same size as Oliver's?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.377
{\an8}[Sebastian] Same size.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.003
{\an8}-Yep.
-You obviously can do

11:11.087 --> 11:12.630
very tight, solid work.
The only thing is,

11:12.713 --> 11:15.299
the markings are different
than the stencil.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.259
You had the stencil.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.761
Your job was to shrink it down
and replicate it.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.762
Some of your lines
go all the way through

11:19.845 --> 11:22.348
and touch the antlers,
some of 'em don't.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.100
Precision-wise,
I just don't feel like

11:24.183 --> 11:26.977
your attention to detail
was as strong.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.604
{\an8}I am [bleep] not happy.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.439
I guess once again,
Oliver takes this one down.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.649
I should at least get credit
for being able to do

11:31.732 --> 11:36.070
the more difficult logo
cleaner than Oliver.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.115
{\an8}-[Dave] Hi, Sarah.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.115
{\an8}-[Chris] That is smaller.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.409
{\an8}It's not as clean
as Oliver's.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.078
Your different line widths
from the lines from the cross

11:44.161 --> 11:46.455
to the outside of the circle,
that's throwing it off.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.207
Your lines
are a little wobbly,

11:48.290 --> 11:49.708
circle's a little suspect.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.001
Your choice
to go a little smaller,

11:51.085 --> 11:53.504
although ambitious,
was not wise.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.799
So here we go.
Mini tats.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.134
We're testing precision.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.885
Did anybody
beat Oliver here?

11:59.969 --> 12:01.971
Jesse was probably
my big surprise of the day,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.849
just 'cause his is super tight
and really precise.

12:04.932 --> 12:05.933
I think he has
a good attention to detail.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.768
I don't think it pulled off
the exact same look,

12:07.852 --> 12:10.271
but I think
he did an amazing tattoo.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.772
How do you think
Sebastian did?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.649
Sebastian did a very technical,
tight tattoo,

12:13.732 --> 12:16.819
however, he did not
follow the stencil.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.737
When you're doing
a mini tat,

12:18.821 --> 12:21.824
every single dot on there
has to be followed to a tee.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.160
Like Sarah running her lines
into the antlers.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.619
{\an5}-Right.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.619
-It's clearly not that way

12:25.703 --> 12:27.163
on the paper
that we handed them.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.873
Tatu Baby's seemed to be

12:28.956 --> 12:30.708
actually
at the bottom of the pack.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.751
{\an5}-The inexperience shows.

12:30.791 --> 12:32.751
-It seems to me,

12:32.835 --> 12:34.086
when it comes to
following the stencil,

12:34.170 --> 12:36.338
Steve's seemed to be
pretty on the money.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.007
{\an5}-I think we have a decision.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.007
{\an3}-Perfect.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.508
All right, man.
Let's tell 'em.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.345
For this <i> Flash Challenge,</i>
we were testing precision.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.182
There were two artists
that really impressed us.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.350
Jesse, you really
followed the stencil.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.436
Did an overall
really detailed, fine job.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.979
You paid attention
to your marks.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.647
{\an5}-Great job, man.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.647
-Thanks.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.774
Steve,
using the single needle,

12:55.858 --> 12:57.860
paying attention to which lines
are supposed to touch,

12:57.943 --> 12:59.403
getting
all those exact details.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.114
{\an5}-Very good job, man.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.114
-Much respect to you.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.074
The judges
have come to a decision,

13:04.158 --> 13:06.035
and the winner
of the Flash Challenge...

13:07.953 --> 13:08.704
Is Steve.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.998
{\an5}-Thanks.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.998
-[applause]

13:11.081 --> 13:11.957
As the field
narrows down,

13:12.041 --> 13:14.835
{\an8}to win <i> Flash Challenges</i>
is more important.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.880
If you drop the ball,
it's gonna cost you $100,000.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.382
You now have the power
to assign all the human canvases

13:20.466 --> 13:22.218
in the <i> Elimination Tattoo</i> .

13:22.301 --> 13:23.552
Head back up to the loft,

13:23.636 --> 13:24.553
and get ready
to meet your canvases

13:24.637 --> 13:27.348
for tonight's
<i>Elimination Tattoo</i> .

13:29.808 --> 13:31.769
{\an8}You're making me
a little nervous.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.103
{\an8}You gotta have confidence
in your artist.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.897
{\an8}I'm freaking out
on the inside.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.066
Two women,
they definitely out.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.025
Ignorant.
Completely ignorant.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.408
Two women, and they've both
been only tattooing six years,

13:46.492 --> 13:47.284
they definitely out.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.245
Completely ignorant.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.913
Why the [bleep]
does it matter?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.082
You do a good job, then that
should be the bottom line.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.418
Well, I truly don't believe
that you guys paid your dues.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.837
Six years, you guys are still
learning how to tattoo.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.130
How does that not factor in?

14:00.214 --> 14:01.090
At six years' experience,

14:01.173 --> 14:01.799
they've been
knocking [bleep] out,

14:01.882 --> 14:03.968
like,
[bleep] Awesomeness.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.719
I won three challenges.
You've been on the bottom.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.472
{\an5}-[clicks tongue]

14:05.803 --> 14:08.472
-Steve is just being

14:08.556 --> 14:10.808
a real dick.
I think he's getting to be

14:10.891 --> 14:11.350
a little over-confident.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.394
There's no point

14:13.477 --> 14:14.937
in arguing with you.
You're not gonna listen.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.690
They're in the old boys' club
of tattooing.

14:17.773 --> 14:18.941
They don't respect women.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.150
Women are just inferior.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.151
That's why
they're not gonna win.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.779
{\an5}-[laughs]

14:21.235 --> 14:23.779
-Bye, sweet potatoes.

14:23.862 --> 14:24.780
{\an5}-Really frustrating.

14:23.862 --> 14:24.780
-[laughs]

14:24.863 --> 14:27.241
They're young
and they can't take it,

14:27.324 --> 14:28.075
that's why I bust 'em.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.326
That's what makes it fun,

14:29.410 --> 14:31.870
but realistically,
they could beat anybody here.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.705
[Bleep] Yeah.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.790
{\an5}-Definitely, I mean--

14:32.788 --> 14:34.790
-Right.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.251
I would let either one of them
clean my bathroom any day.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.961
[laughter]

14:50.931 --> 14:53.475
Welcome to this week's
Elimination Tattoo.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.644
We're testing precision.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.938
Kill it, and you'll be
one of the last four artists

14:58.022 --> 15:01.233
in the hunt for 100 grand,
a feature in <i> Inked magazine,</i>

15:01.317 --> 15:03.485
and the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

15:03.569 --> 15:06.280
Screw it up, and you'll be
packing your machines.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.907
You must also impress
all of America.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.576
Each week,
viewers at home

15:10.659 --> 15:12.328
will vote for the tattoo
that they think is best,

15:12.411 --> 15:13.996
using the same criteria
that the judges use.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.625
Today, we also have
a very special guest judge.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.544
He specializes
in black and gray,

15:20.628 --> 15:23.047
photo-realism, portraits,
and horror.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.299
He's been tattooing
for 15 years.

15:25.382 --> 15:28.510
A little-known fact:
He got his first tattoo

15:28.594 --> 15:30.346
a month before
his 30th birthday.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.931
Bob Tyrrell.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.558
{\an5}-Oh.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.558
-Oh, man.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.393
Oh, my god!

15:36.477 --> 15:37.853
I've been tattooing
all over the world.

15:37.936 --> 15:41.190
{\an8}Black and gray portraits,
mostly.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.316
Portraits are hard, man,

15:42.399 --> 15:45.027
just trying to stay true
to the picture.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.029
You want to really capture
the character of that person.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.323
You can botch
a portrait easy.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.493
{\an8}Bob Tyrell.
Holy [bleep] crap.

15:52.576 --> 15:56.413
This man is a black-and-gray
portrait genius.

15:57.956 --> 16:00.209
That brings us to this week's
Elimination Tattoo.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.835
You'll be tattooing
a subject that is intimidating

16:01.919 --> 16:04.213
for even
the best tattoo artists:

16:04.296 --> 16:06.423
Portraits.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.551
The point of precision
in a portrait

16:09.635 --> 16:11.053
{\an8}is that this
is somebody's face,

16:11.136 --> 16:12.721
{\an8}and trust me,
if you change their face,

16:12.805 --> 16:15.557
it does make them
not look like the person.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.309
As equipment and techniques
have advanced,

16:17.393 --> 16:19.812
it has become possible
for skilled artists

16:19.895 --> 16:22.856
to create tattoos that
are more realistic than ever.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.901
{\an8}I am a portrait artist.
This is my redemption.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.444
Whether of celebrities,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.113
children,
or deceased loved ones,

16:29.196 --> 16:30.906
portraits are as personal
as one can get.

16:30.989 --> 16:35.786
You will have six hours
to tattoo a portrait.

16:35.869 --> 16:36.995
Let's meet your canvases.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.168
Steve, because
you won the <i> Flash Challenge</i> ,

16:43.252 --> 16:45.170
you now have the power
to assign all human canvases.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.341
The decisions you make right now
could determine your fate.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.137
I got this fear
going through my body.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.432
{\an8}I'm a new-school artist going
into a portrait competition

16:56.515 --> 16:56.932
with four
portrait artists.

16:57.015 --> 16:57.891
I'm freaking out.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.561
{\an5}-Who is this?

16:57.975 --> 17:00.561
-This is my grandfather.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.937
{\an5}-Okay.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.937
-I would love to place it,

17:02.020 --> 17:03.105
like, on my thigh.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.107
I can handle
any of these people.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.109
If a picture is blurry, you just
have to fudge certain details.

17:08.193 --> 17:08.986
Even if I get
a fuzzy picture,

17:09.069 --> 17:11.320
I am still gonna be able
to rock this.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.906
Who is this?
This is my father.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.242
{\an8}A great tattoo begins
with a great reference.

17:15.325 --> 17:16.743
The tattoo
I absolutely do not want

17:16.827 --> 17:18.912
is the smallest picture.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.204
Looked like the guy's face
was like, this small.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.750
{\an5}-This is my son.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.750
-Where'd you like to get this?

17:22.833 --> 17:23.876
On the front of my right chin.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.669
{\an5}-And who is this?

17:23.959 --> 17:25.669
-My father.

17:25.752 --> 17:26.627
{\an8}I'm gonna
pick the best for me,

17:26.712 --> 17:28.839
and you know what?
I'm gonna mix 'em up.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.591
Let fate send people home.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.675
I don't care what they get,

17:31.759 --> 17:34.178
because they're
not as good as I am.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.512
Canvases, one by one,

17:35.596 --> 17:38.140
please reveal the name
on the bottom of your skull.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.391
Sebastian.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.894
Baby.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.566
{\an8}Of course, I end up with
the canvas that I least wanted.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.359
{\an5}-[whispering] Damn.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.359
-Jesse.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.070
Sarah.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.532
Steve.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.368
I choose
the human canvas that I do

17:58.452 --> 18:00.120
{\an8}because the picture's great.

18:00.204 --> 18:02.080
It's an older gentlemen with
a lot of details and wrinkles.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.625
That's all precision.
I'm confident

18:04.708 --> 18:06.210
that I can make my tattoo
look great.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.712
Now, what everybody else does
is kind of on them.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.172
You have
the rest of the evening

18:10.255 --> 18:12.132
to consult
with your human canvas.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.259
Tomorrow, you'll have six hours

18:14.343 --> 18:15.385
to complete
your portrait tattoo.

18:15.469 --> 18:19.264
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.892
Good luck.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.811
On this challenge,
we're judging precision.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.938
We want to see it as exact
and as perfect as possible.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.607
There's no room
for interpretation.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.068
This is recreation
of the picture.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.488
So are you partial to color
or black and white?

18:34.571 --> 18:36.615
My son's eyes
are just such a killer blue,

18:36.698 --> 18:38.158
{\an5}-we have to do it in color.

18:36.698 --> 18:38.158
-Okay.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.701
{\an8}If it was the only
color portrait and I nailed it,

18:39.785 --> 18:42.037
that would be amazing.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.039
You do, like,
killer color.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.708
But the guest judge is a
black-and-gray portrait master.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.752
Am I going to be
shooting myself in the foot

18:48.836 --> 18:50.045
if I do this in color?

18:50.128 --> 18:52.089
This is a huge risk.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.967
I just see this bright,
vibrant, colorful kid.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.802
{\an5}-We only have six hours...

18:55.050 --> 18:56.802
-Sure.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.136
And assuming
from this picture,

18:58.220 --> 19:00.389
I know that you want
at least the hands, right?

19:00.472 --> 19:01.932
{\an8}I saw
the fighting position,

19:02.015 --> 19:04.685
{\an8}so I knew that he wasn't
only gonna want face,

19:04.768 --> 19:05.853
{\an8}he was gonna want to throw
those gloves in there.

19:05.936 --> 19:08.480
I definitely want the hands.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.232
I would like to try to get
the symbols in there also.

19:10.315 --> 19:14.778
It takes, like, six hours
just to do the face alone.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.489
I'm worrying, incorporating
so many things into my tattoo

19:17.573 --> 19:19.533
when I only have six hours.

19:19.616 --> 19:20.826
This symbol
is gonna be the killer.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.494
That's gonna be complicated.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.370
Great picture.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.581
When people
bring us in portraits,

19:25.664 --> 19:27.207
this is exactly
what you're looking for.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.792
This style of picture,

19:28.876 --> 19:31.211
{\an8}just doing the stencil
looks just like him.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.255
I want to get all of these nice,
little details in there.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.090
There's definitely
more pressure

19:35.173 --> 19:36.216
any time you're doing
a portrait.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.175
One wrong little shadow
or line,

19:37.259 --> 19:39.720
you've lost the personality
of the face,

19:39.803 --> 19:40.387
and now you're [bleep].

19:42.180 --> 19:43.765
{\an5}-Who is this?

19:42.180 --> 19:43.765
-My grandmother.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.516
Your grandmother,
all right.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.434
The problem
with portraits

19:45.517 --> 19:47.811
is any time
you have a curved surface,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.396
what it tends to do is
create an optical illusion

19:49.479 --> 19:50.689
where it stretches
their heads out.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.524
I'll squish it
just a little bit,

19:52.608 --> 19:54.276
so when it goes around,
it'll actually elongate it,

19:54.359 --> 19:55.110
and it'll fix it.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.862
Just as it's
as close as possible

19:56.945 --> 19:57.821
to the actual picture,
you know what I mean?

19:57.905 --> 20:00.115
Hey, man, I'm gonna
do my best, for sure.

20:00.198 --> 20:02.784
{\an8}You know, I haven't
done a portrait in ten years...

20:02.868 --> 20:04.453
And you don't think her face
should be, like, over more here?

20:04.536 --> 20:09.207
And I've got a canvas
who has very strong feelings

20:09.291 --> 20:10.792
of how he wants
this tattoo done.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.461
I wish there was a way
I could figure out

20:12.544 --> 20:13.587
how to Gauge
the curve here.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.172
Black and gray is definitely
not one of my strengths.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.133
Portraits is not
one of my strengths.

20:18.216 --> 20:20.969
This is two of my weaknesses
grouped into one challenge.

20:21.053 --> 20:21.303
It's gonna be a tough one.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.516
All righty.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.561
Nice grainy picture.
Yay.

20:29.645 --> 20:33.482
{\an8}I'm a photo-realism guy,
but the picture is everything.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.317
This picture
is from the 1960s.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.028
Every time I try to blow it up,
it blurs.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.738
That's horrible.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.200
If you have no detail at all,
you don't have any precision.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.159
I have to pull off
a crazy miracle

20:44.242 --> 20:47.746
to make this great
from a bad picture.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.213
I'm pretty much open to color
or black and white.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.089
{\an5}-I can rock equally.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.089
-If there's anything

20:57.172 --> 20:58.757
that's gonna
shoot you in the foot,

20:58.840 --> 20:59.967
it's doing in color.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.718
In this competition,
that's one thing

21:01.802 --> 21:03.178
that's shot you in the foot
every time.

21:03.261 --> 21:04.846
Is you being like,
"I'm gonna do this,

21:04.930 --> 21:06.556
and sparkles, and twinkles,
and blah, blah, blah,"

21:06.640 --> 21:08.684
and then
you don't quite nail it,

21:08.767 --> 21:10.519
and then that's
what ends up getting you.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.313
I'm just trying to figure out
what would serve me best

21:13.397 --> 21:14.356
in the competition.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.192
Best in the competition
is to play it safe.

21:17.275 --> 21:19.611
My canvas wants
to get this tattoo in color,

21:19.695 --> 21:22.364
but the guest judge
is Bob Tyrell.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.533
He is a black-and-gray
portrait master.

21:24.616 --> 21:26.368
She wants it in color.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.286
{\an5}-Well, do you want to win?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.286
-I want to [bleep] win.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.788
You trying to wow 'em,
or are you trying to survive?

21:29.871 --> 21:31.206
[Bleep] wow 'em.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.083
If you can pull off color
and make it look real,

21:33.166 --> 21:34.292
that totally blows away
black and gray.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.212
{\an8}I want to give my client
what she wants,

21:37.295 --> 21:38.255
but it's a huge risk,

21:38.338 --> 21:39.756
and the more
that I think about it,

21:39.840 --> 21:42.217
the more nervous I get.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.221
Today, you must create
a portrait tattoo.

21:46.304 --> 21:49.641
Remember,
we're testing precision.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.768
If your tattoo
doesn't look like the picture,

21:51.852 --> 21:53.228
you'll be packing.

21:53.311 --> 21:57.524
You have six hours to tattoo,
and your time starts...

21:58.066 --> 21:58.984
Now.

21:59.818 --> 22:00.902
Let's do this, man.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.404
This Elimination Tattoo,

22:02.487 --> 22:04.573
{\an8}this is perfect
for judging precision.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.074
In doing a portrait
of a person,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.076
it needs to look like
that person.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.746
One line out of place
can ruin the shape of the face.

22:11.496 --> 22:12.330
I'm not gonna lie, dude.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.041
I was looking at,
like, your art,

22:14.124 --> 22:14.916
and it was kind of making me
a little nervous,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.169
'cause it's a portrait,

22:17.252 --> 22:18.670
and I didn't really
see any of those from you,

22:18.754 --> 22:20.255
so I was like--
I was like, "oh, my god."

22:20.338 --> 22:21.381
I'm definitely-- I'm putting
a lot of faith in you.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.468
That woman's a Saint in my eyes.
She always will be.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.386
You know, you gotta
have confidence in your artist,

22:26.470 --> 22:27.596
'cause that negative projection
sometimes works against you.

22:27.679 --> 22:32.017
{\an8}My canvas is putting an immense
amount of pressure on me.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.769
Her face looks
a little bit fatter.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.479
We squished it down
so it looks fatter...

22:35.562 --> 22:36.897
Mm-hmm.
When we put it on your leg

22:36.980 --> 22:38.231
and it curves around your leg,
it's gonna look skinnier.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.399
You see
how it skinnies out?

22:39.483 --> 22:42.444
I'm convinced
that the curve of the canvas

22:42.527 --> 22:43.320
is gonna
elongate the portrait.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.280
By squishing it down
a little bit,

22:45.363 --> 22:46.782
it's gonna
compensate for that.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.450
I need you
behind me on this, man.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.452
Trust me, I need to be
behind you in this.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.787
[laughter]
Oh, good. Good, good.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.831
Everybody's wondering
if I can pull this portrait off.

22:54.915 --> 22:55.999
It's pretty intimidating.

22:57.918 --> 22:58.710
Kind of a little bit
of a change of plan.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.420
{\an5}-[laughs]

22:58.794 --> 23:00.420
-Okay. Okay, all right.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.464
I would love to [bleep]
rock a color portrait...

23:02.547 --> 23:04.132
{\an5}-Okay.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.132
-But if I do that...

23:04.216 --> 23:05.133
All right.
Like, we're gonna get

23:05.217 --> 23:06.718
reamed a new [bleep].

23:06.802 --> 23:07.886
I do color portraits
all the time,

23:07.969 --> 23:10.639
but the judges all love
black and gray more than color.

23:10.722 --> 23:14.309
This is $100,000, and I would
feel a lot more comfortable

23:14.392 --> 23:15.769
if we were doing this
in black and gray.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.896
So are you cool
with this direction?

23:17.979 --> 23:18.605
[chuckles]

23:21.066 --> 23:22.526
I mean, I don't mind it
in black and white. I don't.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.527
You could still
capture him in it.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.446
Yes!

23:26.530 --> 23:28.990
I'm going to duplicate
this photo

23:29.074 --> 23:32.160
down to the very stitch
in her child's shirt.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.455
I am going to show the judges
how precise I can be.

23:40.919 --> 23:44.506
{\an8}My canvas really wants
those hands in the portrait,

23:44.589 --> 23:46.842
{\an8}and he wants the logos.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.635
So I tell him
I will do a smaller size

23:48.718 --> 23:50.011
and get the symbols
that he wanted.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.012
I'm gonna show precision

23:51.096 --> 23:53.682
from copying exactly
what's on this picture.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.809
May the best
portrait artist win.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.274
Five hours left, everybody.
Five hours to go.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.360
This is the worst picture
to work from.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.611
'Cause of the contrast
and the grain?

24:06.695 --> 24:08.655
No, 'cause the blur--
yeah, the graininess.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.573
Look at it.

24:09.656 --> 24:10.991
{\an8}The photo,
blurry as hell,

24:11.074 --> 24:13.618
but I got enough of the gist
to actually follow the blur

24:13.702 --> 24:18.707
to make it sharp, and it's
because I am a portrait artist.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.252
I have to find the clean parts
of that in my head.

24:22.335 --> 24:24.546
You have to be able to pull off
bad pictures sometimes.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.924
Pulling that off will be
a [bleep] guaranteed win.

24:33.346 --> 24:34.097
I'm feeling great.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.348
{\an8}The picture is so clear.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.059
You know
it's gonna be a home run.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.311
{\an5}-We're getting there.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.311
{\an1}-Cool.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.645
How's Jesse doing?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.606
{\an5}-He's finished the hair.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.606
-Did the hair first?

24:42.689 --> 24:44.357
{\an5}-Yeah.

24:42.689 --> 24:44.357
-Okay.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.279
I start coloring in the hair,
and I'm realizing

24:49.362 --> 24:51.656
that squishing the initial photo
was a bad idea.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.244
How you feeling
about it?

24:56.328 --> 24:56.870
As long as she don't look like
she just got out of taco bell,

24:56.953 --> 24:58.914
I'm golden.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.625
I gave this guy
a fat grandma.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.752
That's the one fear
that my canvas had.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.671
We still talk about her
like she's in the next room.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.423
That's how much
she meant to the family.

25:08.506 --> 25:10.675
I'm trying to project
confidence in this scenario,

25:10.759 --> 25:14.387
even though I'm super
freaking out on the inside.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.937
What's going on, bro?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.688
Bob's work
tends to be a little darker

25:23.772 --> 25:26.149
because it last longer,
it gives more contrast,

25:26.233 --> 25:27.901
so I'm gonna do
this portrait darker

25:27.984 --> 25:29.069
to match more of his style.

25:29.152 --> 25:31.988
Dude, that guy's face is black.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.200
I don't hate that.
I like the dark portraits.

25:35.909 --> 25:36.868
It's too much.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.625
To make her look
a little thinner,

25:43.708 --> 25:45.669
I kick a little more shadow
on the jawbone,

25:45.752 --> 25:48.505
and also bring the hair in
a little bit on the right side,

25:48.588 --> 25:52.092
but even after all that,
it still looks chubby.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.176
You're like,
"I'm covering the face.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.469
I don't want anyone
to see it."

25:55.303 --> 25:57.013
Jesse squeezed the image.

25:57.097 --> 25:59.641
I'm not sure where
that was a good idea.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.892
What's up, bro?

26:00.976 --> 26:05.438
The portrait at this point
is past the point of no return.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.649
I'm really embarrassed.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.985
He is tattooing this thing
wall-to-wall.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.320
There is no places
where he's leaving the highlight

26:12.404 --> 26:14.739
for this thing
to have dimension.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.074
You can tell he doesn't know
what he's doing.

26:16.157 --> 26:18.451
Black-and-gray portrait,
you can't solid gray

26:18.535 --> 26:19.995
{\an5}-the whole thing, man.

26:18.535 --> 26:19.995
-Yeah, no.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.163
Not much highlights,
just some on the nose.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.457
There is no untattooed pore
in that whole area.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.167
Portraits
are incredibly difficult.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.503
{\an8}Not everybody is meant
to be a portrait artist.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.463
If you're gonna win this thing,
you're gonna have to

26:30.547 --> 26:31.673
be able to do every category.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.591
That's the toughie
in this one.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.093
Final hour,
everybody.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.392
Sebastian might be
going a little overboard,

26:42.475 --> 26:44.144
adding different shadowing.

26:45.061 --> 26:48.273
He's inverted
the shading on his face.

26:48.356 --> 26:49.524
It's darker on the face
instead of lighter,

26:49.607 --> 26:52.027
lighter in the back
instead of darker.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.362
Why can't he copy
what's in front of him?

26:54.446 --> 26:59.075
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

26:59.159 --> 27:04.539
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.000
That's it, time's up.
No more ink.

27:07.083 --> 27:07.834
You like it?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.170
Looks like
a mirror of my father.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.629
Oh, Sarah,
that's amazing.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.299
That's perfect.
It's absolutely perfect.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.718
Thank you so much.
I absolutely love it.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.220
{\an5}-And there he is.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.220
-Oh, my god.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.847
Oh, yes.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.307
You have his back forever.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.851
That's right!
I got your back forever.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.102
{\an5}-Oh, man.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.102
-Oh.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.854
[laughs]

27:27.937 --> 27:29.647
I'm looking around
at all the tattoos,

27:29.731 --> 27:32.317
and I'm realizing
that mine's the worst.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.694
When it comes to elimination,
whoever I'm in the bottom with,

27:34.778 --> 27:36.237
I'm hoping the judges
will see more potential in me,

27:36.321 --> 27:38.823
moving forward, than them.

27:41.242 --> 27:43.161
{\an8}I didn't change
the [bleep] face.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.704
{\an8}Are you kidding me, because
that [bleep] is horrible.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.457
{\an8}Well, you can be a
smart-ass about it, but--

27:47.540 --> 27:49.334
be mad at me all you want,
but it ain't my fault.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.461
You totally
[Bleep] it up.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.843
I started doing the hair,
and I was just, like,

27:58.927 --> 28:00.345
"the hair's not working,"
and I started doing the face,

28:00.428 --> 28:02.430
and I was just like,

28:02.514 --> 28:03.765
"[Bleep]! I already did
that cheek too dark."

28:03.848 --> 28:06.101
Why didn't you know?
You've been tattooing

28:06.184 --> 28:07.519
way longer than me.

28:07.602 --> 28:08.978
How the [bleep]
you didn't know?

28:09.062 --> 28:10.438
With the experience he has,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.357
he should be able
to pull off this kind of work.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.400
At this point in the game,

28:13.483 --> 28:16.903
you can't drop the ball
that hard

28:16.986 --> 28:18.446
and still stay in
the competition,

28:18.530 --> 28:21.282
no matter how good
you can do your style.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.659
Did it follow
the letter of the challenge?

28:22.742 --> 28:24.077
That's what
they're gonna decipher.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.453
It does come down
to just how much

28:25.537 --> 28:26.955
it looks just like the picture.

28:27.038 --> 28:30.208
I mean, you actually
made the face bigger, you said?

28:30.291 --> 28:32.419
I didn't change
the [bleep] face.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.711
Are you kidding me?
That [bleep] is horrible.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.305
[dramatic music]

28:44.389 --> 28:49.519
♪ ♪

28:50.645 --> 28:53.606
This week, we asked you
to create a portrait tattoo.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.774
We're testing precision.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.570
Tatu Baby, you're up first.

29:01.990 --> 29:02.740
How you feeling
about your work here?

29:02.824 --> 29:04.033
Do you feel like
you're in the top?

29:04.117 --> 29:07.704
I feel I did a great tattoo
for the reference that I had.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.998
You did an amazing job
capturing this guy's character.

29:10.081 --> 29:14.836
The very precise little details,
the way you got the mustache,

29:14.919 --> 29:17.464
and the little curls
in the hair, right on.

29:17.547 --> 29:19.507
Doing small faces like that
are always tricky.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.343
It's really hard
to capture a likeness

29:22.427 --> 29:23.887
the smaller the face is.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.430
This tattoo came out great.

29:25.513 --> 29:28.766
The way that you captured
the skin tone of his dad,

29:28.850 --> 29:30.477
you used a lot of light
in the face

29:30.560 --> 29:32.562
to really accent
his features.

29:32.645 --> 29:33.646
This was the right way
to do it.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.274
Another consistent outing
for you.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.817
It's a good job,
and it was a tough one.

29:41.738 --> 29:42.780
Steve.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.868
Why did you end up
selecting this one for yourself?

29:46.951 --> 29:50.246
I liked the character
in the face, the wrinkles.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.207
{\an5}-Tough, old dude.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.207
-You made a wise choice.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.917
The hair's really,
really impressive.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.877
The very small,
small uses of white

29:55.960 --> 29:57.378
really make this thing
stand out.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.047
You really hit the precision

29:59.130 --> 30:01.716
with the wrinkles
and the character in his face.

30:01.799 --> 30:03.801
As far as
the area of the collar,

30:03.885 --> 30:05.053
I would like
to have seen you maybe

30:05.136 --> 30:06.387
get a little bit deeper
in there

30:06.471 --> 30:07.305
and really
cherried this thing out

30:07.388 --> 30:09.098
to really
set this thing off crazy,

30:09.182 --> 30:10.850
but overall, man,
that's just nitpicking.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.519
You did a great tattoo.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.395
I loved the use of black
in this tattoo,

30:14.479 --> 30:17.482
but I feel like
there are some areas in his skin

30:17.565 --> 30:18.942
where you did go
a little bit too dark.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.485
There's a few areas in the photo
where it's a little lighter.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.820
You kind of overcompensated.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.155
I used to do 'em
very, very light,

30:24.239 --> 30:25.114
and then find out,
two or three years later,

30:25.198 --> 30:26.658
they'd come back,
nose would be missing.

30:26.741 --> 30:28.993
I tend to go
a little darker now.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.578
This tattoo's definitely
built to last,

30:30.662 --> 30:32.288
and some of the details
in this thing

30:32.372 --> 30:33.873
really put you
at the top of the crowd here.

30:36.125 --> 30:37.043
Sarah.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.715
Kids can be tricky.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.009
There's not a whole lot
of wrinkles and dimensions.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.844
It doesn't necessarily
have to be wrinkles

30:46.928 --> 30:47.929
in order to add character.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.265
Honestly, I kind of like
doing kid portraits.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.182
This tattoo is amazing.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.601
The face,
you nailed his character.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.562
The likeness
is totally there.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.272
I like how you went-- with
the shadow underneath the chin,

30:57.355 --> 30:58.273
you went
a little bit lighter.

30:58.356 --> 31:00.275
It kinda brings out
the edge of the chin,

31:00.358 --> 31:02.110
which was a good call.
It's awesome.

31:02.193 --> 31:03.653
Doing this
in black and gray,

31:03.736 --> 31:05.863
you gave yourself the time
to really make it nice.

31:05.947 --> 31:06.864
Very precise
with all the details.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.325
Well, you guys
wanted to see precision.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.493
Most people
would have been lucky

31:10.577 --> 31:11.953
to pull off the face,
but not very many people

31:12.036 --> 31:13.913
could have pulled off
that shirt. A very good job.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.624
I love the hair
because I love the dimension.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.126
I love the layers.
It literally

31:18.209 --> 31:19.711
looks like you can see
the kid's haircut.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.254
You definitely
pulled it back together.

31:21.337 --> 31:23.548
It's nice to see people
take a hard shot

31:23.631 --> 31:24.966
and come back, and you have.

31:25.049 --> 31:26.759
When you take a lump,
you have to man up,

31:26.843 --> 31:27.969
accept what you did, move on,
and never do it again.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.972
This is definitely
your best tattoo up here.

31:31.055 --> 31:31.931
Thank you, guys.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.811
Mr. Jesse Smith.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.441
How are you feeling
about this?

31:41.524 --> 31:42.317
I feel like
I dropped the ball.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.819
We're judging precision.
I got to say,

31:44.902 --> 31:46.738
I don't feel like
any of the details

31:46.821 --> 31:48.656
in this tattoo are precise.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.033
The hair could be
a little more realistic.

31:50.116 --> 31:51.534
Hair is a tough thing to do.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.827
It's one of the hardest things
in a portrait.

31:52.910 --> 31:54.329
It could've been
more detailed.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.998
It looks a little too--
just not real enough.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.083
You look at this photo,
you see strands.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.668
The way
you tattooed this hair

32:00.752 --> 32:03.963
is more like
a weird fur/tribal pattern,

32:04.047 --> 32:07.175
not to mention, just
the entire perimeter of the face

32:07.258 --> 32:07.842
does not look the same.

32:07.925 --> 32:08.968
You totally [bleep] it up.

32:11.095 --> 32:13.056
Your style of tattooing
is very wall-to-wall,

32:13.139 --> 32:14.515
but you can't tattoo
a portrait wall-to-wall.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.851
What you do,
you're great at,

32:16.934 --> 32:20.563
but what you need to do
is get great at everything else

32:20.647 --> 32:22.315
because you're supposed to.

32:22.398 --> 32:23.858
I don't like
this part of my day.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.611
{\an5}-Hey, it's my fault.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.611
-It sucks.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.117
Sebastian.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.623
How you feeling
about this piece?

32:38.706 --> 32:39.540
Uh, well,
in the photo,

32:39.624 --> 32:41.042
I didn't have very much
to work with.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.419
{\an5}-It's blurry.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.419
-It's not that blurry.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.129
It's still
a good photo overall.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.173
With a photo like this, the goal
is to make it look better.

32:47.256 --> 32:48.716
I would've done
a dark background.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.176
You kinda
did the opposite.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.511
You darkened up
the side of the cheek,

32:51.594 --> 32:52.553
and then you did
a lighter background.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.222
That alters the likeness
a little bit.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.139
As far as precision goes,

32:55.223 --> 32:57.392
you're trying
to duplicate the photo.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.268
It's cool to change stuff around
in a portrait,

32:59.352 --> 33:00.687
as long as it still
looks like that person.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.605
I can tell you, I definitely
would've had the precision,

33:02.689 --> 33:04.357
but just could not see
some of that stuff

33:04.440 --> 33:05.149
just blurred out.

33:05.233 --> 33:07.402
You did not
follow the photo.

33:07.485 --> 33:10.863
You did not do a portrait.
You did something else.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.533
You completely reversed
the light and dark

33:13.616 --> 33:14.450
in the left side
of the face

33:14.534 --> 33:15.952
from the background
to the foreground.

33:16.035 --> 33:18.663
I've never seen anybody
flip a portrait picture.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.457
Trust me, I had all intentions
to do it exactly the way it was.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.418
I don't understand
how that intention varies

33:23.501 --> 33:25.586
to the point
where you blacken the face.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.255
Bob, does that ever
happen to you in portraits?

33:27.338 --> 33:28.589
Do you ever
switch the portrait around?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.591
I mean, well, you can be
a smart-ass about it, but--

33:30.675 --> 33:32.885
I can be a smart-ass,
'cause I'm looking at that.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.345
So if you want to look at
what I'm looking at,

33:34.429 --> 33:35.138
then we can talk about it.

33:35.221 --> 33:38.015
I can't judge that
against that

33:38.099 --> 33:39.934
and tell you
you did a great job.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.185
You want to fight, huh?

33:41.269 --> 33:42.437
No, I don't want to fight,

33:42.520 --> 33:44.439
'cause if I did,
I would've ran over there.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.064
You can be mad at me
all you want,

33:45.148 --> 33:46.816
but it ain't my fault.

33:46.899 --> 33:48.651
You totally decided
to do your own thing with it,

33:48.735 --> 33:49.110
and it was a bad choice.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.449
Head back to the loft.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.284
For one of you,
it'll be your last visit,

33:56.367 --> 33:57.535
because when you return,

33:57.618 --> 34:00.121
someone will be packing
their machine and closing shop.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.790
We'll call you back
when we've made our decision.

34:10.505 --> 34:13.842
What the [bleep], Sebastian?
You never argue with the judges.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.428
I don't give a [bleep]
about them.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.304
I'm fine with criticism.

34:17.388 --> 34:19.891
You don't gotta be a [bleep]
smart-ass to [bleep] critique.

34:19.974 --> 34:21.100
You know what I'm saying?

34:21.184 --> 34:21.851
"Oh, you want to fight?"
No, if I wanted to fight,

34:21.934 --> 34:24.187
I would've came over there.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.980
I think Sebastian
put a nail in his coffin.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.315
I don't give a [bleep].

34:27.398 --> 34:28.399
You gonna fight to stay?

34:28.483 --> 34:29.942
I'll decide
when I hear how I'm asked.

34:30.025 --> 34:33.112
{\an8}I think Sebastian's
really stupid.

34:33.196 --> 34:35.907
Just gonna let Sebastian
talk himself out of here.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.492
{\an8}Well, when somebody's
coming in

34:37.574 --> 34:39.159
{\an8}and they're being
a severe [Bleep]

34:39.243 --> 34:40.661
The way Nunez is,

34:40.745 --> 34:41.996
I just choke the [bleep]
out of them.

34:53.132 --> 34:53.966
You gonna fight for this?

34:54.050 --> 34:55.592
How should I defend myself?

34:55.676 --> 34:56.511
The challenge was precision.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.638
You know, you went
a little too dark.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.640
You have to go at Sebastian.
You have to.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.016
I don't see another way out.

35:02.099 --> 35:04.977
Sebastian's been middle
of the road, that is a fact.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.355
He's not great at anything,
but he's good at everything.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.190
I think that right there

35:09.273 --> 35:10.399
tells me everything
I need to know.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.027
Everybody left in the house
has won multiple challenges,

35:13.110 --> 35:16.531
have beat everybody else
multiple times.

35:16.614 --> 35:17.865
Sebastian's won nothing.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.451
This is his strong point,
and he's at the bottom.

35:20.535 --> 35:22.745
You basically gotta just say,
"listen, I'm a great artist.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.039
"I'm a great tattoo artist,
you know?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.624
And if you're looking
for middle of the road--"

35:28.626 --> 35:30.002
Yeah, we'll see, man.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.046
I hope you're right.

35:33.965 --> 35:34.966
All right, guys.
We're talking about precision.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.134
We're talking about portraits.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.261
Let's look at Steve's work.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.470
The little details
in this thing

35:39.554 --> 35:41.347
are what really
make it stand out,

35:41.430 --> 35:43.391
just the wrinkles in the eye,
the eyebrows.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.851
I feel like the hair
gets a little squirrelly

35:44.934 --> 35:46.102
over the ear, though, no?

35:46.185 --> 35:48.145
I feel like
it's pretty true to the photo.

35:48.229 --> 35:48.855
You know what else
threw me on this one?

35:48.938 --> 35:51.065
We're looking at precision.

35:51.148 --> 35:53.067
The big tooth in the front,
the way it comes down

35:53.150 --> 35:55.152
on that point
where he put the highlight,

35:55.236 --> 35:57.488
it's not like that in the photo,
it's completely flat.

35:57.572 --> 35:58.531
It's nitpicking,
and it's a great job,

35:58.614 --> 36:01.200
but that mouth and that
little section of hair

36:01.284 --> 36:02.243
{\an5}-threw me.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.243
-[both] Yeah.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.619
{\an5}-You know what I mean?

36:02.326 --> 36:03.619
-Exactly.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.078
{\an5}-Yeah.

36:03.703 --> 36:04.078
-He lost it.

36:04.161 --> 36:05.705
We got Sarah's.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.623
For me, this is
the one of the day.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.167
What amazing attention
to detail in that shirt.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.211
That's my favorite part
of the tattoo.

36:12.295 --> 36:13.671
The shirt came out amazing.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.964
Flannel shirts
are hard to pull off.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.757
It's pretty much
as good as it gets.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.092
Steve and Sarah,
it's almost 50/50 for me.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.761
{\an5}-That's a tough one.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.761
-Tatu Baby,

36:20.845 --> 36:22.513
another great tattoo.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.764
There are certain things
in the photo

36:23.848 --> 36:25.224
you don't really
see any value in them,

36:25.308 --> 36:26.851
but she brought it out
more in the tattoo,

36:26.934 --> 36:28.769
so you can really see
the wrinkles and everything.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.313
And to be able to use
those skin breaks

36:30.396 --> 36:32.273
with those
darker undertones.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.400
She knows exactly how to tattoo
this quality of skin.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.862
{\an5}-Let's move it along.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.862
-Jesse.

36:37.945 --> 36:39.447
When you compare it
to that photo,

36:39.530 --> 36:41.449
it's such a drastic difference,
it hurts me to look at this.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.745
The reason these eyes look
so goddamn crazy is that white.

36:45.828 --> 36:46.913
He shouldn't have put the
white highlight in the left eye.

36:46.996 --> 36:47.997
This kid seems to have

36:48.080 --> 36:50.958
a really great sense
of light sources--

36:51.042 --> 36:53.210
his own made-up light sources.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.588
Anywhere
where he has to replicate,

36:55.671 --> 36:57.006
it's almost
a block for him.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.758
If I was gonna
enter this contest,

36:58.841 --> 37:01.052
I would've done some homework
before I got here.

37:01.135 --> 37:01.594
{\an5}-Right.

37:01.135 --> 37:01.594
-Final one of the day,

37:01.677 --> 37:03.471
Sebastian.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.306
Sebastian did a horrible tattoo.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.683
{\an5}-He didn't nail the likeness.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.683
-Damn it, he flipped it,

37:07.767 --> 37:09.602
and we're looking
at precision,

37:09.685 --> 37:11.145
and I don't believe
that you can

37:11.228 --> 37:12.939
take that kind of Liberty
in a portrait.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.315
{\an5}-It's a lot different.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.315
-Completely flipped.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.443
Here's the thing,
it's not a bad-looking dude...

37:17.526 --> 37:18.027
{\an5}-It doesn't look like him.

37:17.526 --> 37:18.027
-It's just not

37:18.110 --> 37:19.779
the dude in the picture.

37:19.862 --> 37:21.072
Bottom two are definite:
Jesse and Sebastian.

37:21.155 --> 37:23.950
I think we've got a decision.
Oliver, you want to go get 'em?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.326
{\an5}-Yes, sir.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.326
-All right, let's do it.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.287
[door closing]

37:31.207 --> 37:35.836
The judges want to see Steve,
Sarah, Jesse, and Sebastian.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.129
Baby, you're home alone.

37:37.213 --> 37:40.174
{\an5}-[groans]

37:37.213 --> 37:40.174
-I'll see you later.

37:40.257 --> 37:40.841
Oh, [bleep].

37:40.925 --> 37:44.720
[dramatic music]

37:44.804 --> 37:48.349
♪ ♪

37:50.768 --> 37:53.521
Today, we tested you
on precision in your tattooing.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.774
In this group of four, there was
a top two and a bottom two.

37:58.109 --> 37:58.943
Steve, Sarah,

37:59.026 --> 38:01.946
you guys are the top two.

38:02.029 --> 38:04.448
The judges have decided
that the tattoo of the day...

38:09.120 --> 38:10.204
Goes to Sarah.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.747
Sarah,
we all loved your tattoo.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.749
It's as good
as portraits get.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.960
The shirt's amazing.
The hair was amazing.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.086
Well done.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.215
That obviously means
that Jesse and Sebastian,

38:21.298 --> 38:22.383
you guys
are the bottom two.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.511
Jesse, this tattoo,
to me today, is a bummer.

38:25.594 --> 38:26.679
Black and gray has been
one of your weaknesses.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.724
Unfortunately, today,
this was a challenge that was

38:29.807 --> 38:32.810
out of your realm of tricks,
and it just shows, man.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.770
I mean, I don't have
too many legs to stand on here.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.064
My portrait obviously sucks,

38:37.148 --> 38:39.233
and if we're looking
for precision and detail,

38:39.317 --> 38:41.402
this is
Sebastian's strong suit,

38:41.485 --> 38:42.862
so if there's one thing
he shouldn't drop the ball on,

38:42.945 --> 38:44.864
it should be this.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.115
If I dropped the ball
in new school,

38:46.198 --> 38:48.284
and I was in the bottom two
in new school,

38:48.367 --> 38:50.286
I would have
sent myself home.

38:50.369 --> 38:51.078
Well, I'd like to say,
Jesse's a dickhead

38:51.162 --> 38:53.080
for throwing me
under the bus.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.415
[mocking]
I didn't execute precision.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.791
Jesse made his face fatter.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.377
That's [bleep]-up precision,
trying to make a face fat.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.295
What's that, Sebastian?

38:59.378 --> 39:00.046
Talking about
executing precision.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.715
Like, he made a face fatter.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.176
You don't ever
change the actual face.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.802
Literally change it.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.179
We're seeing
a new side of you today.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.180
To hear him throw me
under the bus like that

39:09.263 --> 39:11.599
is not a happy [bleep] moment
for me.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.769
Make a case for yourself.
Don't make a case off of me.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.937
But it's what you do, man.
You should've nailed it.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.398
That's all I got to say.

39:19.482 --> 39:21.317
Sebastian,
we're judging on precision,

39:21.400 --> 39:22.401
and we're judging
on exactly what the photo is.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.821
You tattoo overall,
it just doesn't pull off

39:25.905 --> 39:27.490
side-by-side
what the challenge was.

39:27.573 --> 39:28.574
Do you agree or disagree?

39:28.657 --> 39:30.826
No, man.
I had the picture that I had,

39:30.910 --> 39:32.620
and the only reason
that my portrait

39:32.703 --> 39:35.122
came out the way it did
is because of the picture,

39:35.206 --> 39:36.499
and there is nothing else
I could do about it.

39:36.582 --> 39:37.875
If I would've had
a better picture,

39:37.958 --> 39:38.918
it would've worked out
a different way

39:39.001 --> 39:39.835
because this is what I do.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.128
I didn't have it,

39:41.212 --> 39:42.213
so what the [bleep]
can you do about it?

39:42.296 --> 39:45.091
Can you do a portrait?
Do you use skin properly?

39:45.174 --> 39:48.469
You do. It's just
the simple fact that today,

39:48.552 --> 39:49.762
not so much.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.347
You give me a better picture
or whatever challenge comes next

39:51.430 --> 39:53.057
that Jesse's probably
gonna drop the ball on

39:53.140 --> 39:55.184
because he doesn't do it,

39:55.267 --> 39:57.269
then I'll probably
do a hell of a lot better,

39:57.353 --> 39:58.771
but I mean, [bleep] happens.

39:58.854 --> 39:59.980
I might have did
some grays,

40:00.064 --> 40:01.649
but I didn't make her
[bleep] fat.

40:01.732 --> 40:04.610
Sebastian, Jesse
did make a very valid point.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.655
The judges have decided...

40:13.953 --> 40:16.080
Jesse, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.958
Get the [bleep] outta here.

40:19.041 --> 40:21.377
I really enjoy
watching you work.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.420
The technical aspect
that you have

40:23.504 --> 40:25.881
in the way you deliver
your tattoos is incredible.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.883
What you do,
you do top of your field.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.301
It sucks, man.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.845
It sucks 'cause I wanted
to see the battle royale.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.180
However, today, unfortunately,
you got beat out.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.266
I made my bed,
I'm lying in it.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.518
We hate to see you go, buddy.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.478
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.982
I'm really bummed out.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.733
I know that I can do
a better portrait.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.819
I just dropped the ball
pretty hard today.

40:46.902 --> 40:47.820
This is the worst tattoo

40:47.903 --> 40:49.446
I've done
in the entire competition.

40:49.530 --> 40:52.074
