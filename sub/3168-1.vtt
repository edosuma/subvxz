00:26.880 --> 00:29.201
Okay. Happy birthday, Mom.

00:29.400 --> 00:32.563
- Oh, is that for me?
- You don't look 40, much less 50.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.280
Charlie, please.
But thank you. I appreciate it.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.528
- Can I open this now?
- Yes, open it.

00:37.760 --> 00:39.762
Oh, my goodness.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.807
- Oh, I love it.
- Do you like it? Oh, good.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.331
It's so beautiful.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.642
- You can exchange it.
- I'm not going to.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.081
- You always get me things I love.
- Good.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.449
- Sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hey. Hey, isn't Lisa coming?

00:54.640 --> 00:56.051
No. We split up.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.443
Yes, I did notice your status
popped up to single, yet again.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.927
I forgot your present.
I left it in my locker.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.970
That's okay.
I hope you didn't spend too much.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.970
- No, don't worry. He didn't.
- Where have you been?

01:10.160 --> 01:13.323
The ER was like a madhouse.
One guy came in, six stab wounds.

01:13.520 --> 01:17.081
- One missed his heart by an inch.
- No. Tom, it's dinnertime. Please.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.169
- Not yet it isn't.
- Nearly.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.160
- So, what kind of antibiotic do you...?
- Mom, have you spoken to Lydia?

01:23.880 --> 01:27.168
She wanted to be here,
but she had a really important audition.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.921
- What for?
- A guest spot on some TV thing.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.726
- Something Enemy.
- Maybe this'll be her big break.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.723
- Yeah, maybe.
- Don't hold your breath.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.926
Stop it.

01:40.160 --> 01:44.131
You guys must have been something
growing up. Dolls with heads cut off.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.402
No, my sister and I were very close.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.490
Oh, no. I'm sorry,
I was talking about Anna and Lydia.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.481
My goodness.
I don't know why I said that.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.763
We're here to celebrate you, Mom.
Dad, what about a toast?

01:55.960 --> 01:57.405
Dad!

01:57.600 --> 01:59.250
Toast.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.130
Yes, yes, yes.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.564
To the most beautiful
and the most intelligent woman...

02:05.760 --> 02:09.366
- ...I have known in my entire life.
- Thank you.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.968
- Happy birthday.
- Cheers! Happy birthday!

02:12.160 --> 02:13.525
- We love you.
- I love you.

02:13.720 --> 02:15.165
- Cheers.
- Cheers, darling.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.930
My name is Frederick Johnson.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.164
I'm associate professor
of cognitive science here at UCLA.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.648
I'm here to welcome our speaker
who just flew in from New York.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.362
Now, in my dissertation,
I spent about a chapter and a half...

02:36.560 --> 02:40.565
vituperatively citing today's guest
and saying why she was wrong.

02:42.800 --> 02:46.805
For the record, every time that Alice
and I have argued, she was right.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.243
Alice Howland is the Lillian Young
Professor of Linguistics...

02:50.480 --> 02:54.087
at Columbia University. She famously
wrote her seminal textbook...

02:54.280 --> 02:56.886
From Neurons to Nouns,
while raising three children.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.811
I'm sure getting more than
a few "A-ha" moments from them.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.163
And it is now considered
one of the cornerstones...

03:03.360 --> 03:05.840
of linguistics education
all over the world.

03:06.080 --> 03:10.210
Please welcome Dr. Alice Howland.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.641
Thank you so much.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.765
Most children speak
and understand their mother tongue...

03:21.960 --> 03:25.203
before the age of 4,
without lessons, homework...

03:25.400 --> 03:27.323
or much in the way of feedback.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.369
How do they accomplish this feat?

03:29.920 --> 03:34.323
This is a question that has interested
scientists at least since Charles Darwin...

03:34.560 --> 03:37.848
kept a diary of the early language
of his infant son.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.283
He observed, "Man has
an instinctive tendency to speak...

03:41.480 --> 03:44.290
as we see in the babble
of young children."

03:44.720 --> 03:46.529
Much has been learned since then.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.691
But today I'd like to focus
on some recent studies from my lab...

03:50.880 --> 03:54.601
on the acquisition of past-tense
irregular verb forms in children...

03:54.800 --> 03:57.883
between the ages of 18 months
and two and a half years.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.162
Now, you may say that this falls...

04:00.360 --> 04:03.364
into the academic tradition
of knowing more and more...

04:03.560 --> 04:07.087
about less and less
until we know everything about nothing.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.648
But I hope to convince you
that by observing these baby steps...

04:10.840 --> 04:12.524
into the...

04:16.800 --> 04:18.450
Into...

04:20.440 --> 04:23.728
I... I knew I shouldn't have had
that champagne.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.482
Into the word stock
of a given language...

04:30.680 --> 04:32.808
we will learn crucial information...

04:33.040 --> 04:36.123
about the relationship
between memory and computation...

04:36.320 --> 04:40.564
that is the very essence
of communication.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.288
Lexicon.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.922
I have that same thought. Makes sense.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.646
- I saw it.
- Yeah, I thought about that.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.364
Okay. I'm gonna go down
and get Shel. I'll be right back.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.887
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.445
Hey, no, I'm sorry.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.642
You just caught me by surprise.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.126
Come on in. It's...

05:46.360 --> 05:50.285
It's messy, but, you know,
I was in the process of cleaning.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.084
It's fine, honey. Don't worry.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.841
The boys are total slobs.
The kitchen is the main battleground...

05:56.080 --> 05:59.448
but I've got them in training,
so we'll see how that goes.

06:00.080 --> 06:02.924
- So where are they?
- Working.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.006
Doug's at Starbucks,
Malcolm does some catering.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.965
I guess that's what they mean
by working actor, huh?

06:10.840 --> 06:14.561
- You involved with either one of them?
- Doug's gay.

06:14.760 --> 06:18.731
And Malcolm and I did have a thing,
but it's over.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.164
He got me in with Open Space.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.324
- It's, like, the best theater company.
- Yes, I heard.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.730
Oh, thank you. Yeah, I'm done.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.928
It would have been awesome
if you saw No Exit.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.001
- Daddy said you were good.
- I was all right. It wasn't my best night...

06:39.200 --> 06:42.363
but at least he could get,
you know, like, a sense of it.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.002
Figure out why he's doing...

06:45.440 --> 06:47.841
you know, me a solid with the company.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.769
What do you mean?

06:50.440 --> 06:54.365
- It's really nice of him to help out.
- How is he helping with the company?

06:54.600 --> 06:57.331
It's our responsibility
as members to raise equity...

06:57.560 --> 07:00.689
for the productions we put on.
Eventually we get a cut...

07:00.880 --> 07:03.531
of the box office.
We're sort of shareholders.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.802
So basically you have to pay to act?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.650
No.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.563
It's a theater group.
It's just the reality of the situation.

07:12.760 --> 07:14.728
That's how it is. It's Los Angeles.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.526
Don't you think it's time
you reconsidered things?

07:17.720 --> 07:21.441
You're so smart. There's much more
you could be doing with your life.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.371
- Like going to college?
- Yes. Yes. Like college.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.690
Like we've never talked about that before.
Every single day of my life.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.446
I figured out what I wanted to do,
and I'm doing it. It's a good thing.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.650
- But on whose dime?
- You're helping Tom with med school.

07:36.840 --> 07:41.368
- You helped Anna with law school.
- Sweetheart, those are real careers.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.887
I just don't want you
to limit your choices.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.605
- You want to make my choices.
- No, I don't.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.731
I'm really happy.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.242
I'm sorry. I don't...

07:57.280 --> 07:59.487
I don't wanna argue about this.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.963
- Just forget I said anything, okay?
- It's forgotten.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.841
- Gonna check your phone?
- It's just a game.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.089
Your sister and I have an obsession
with "Words with Friends."

08:10.280 --> 08:12.760
- That's cute.
- You don't wanna play with her...

08:12.960 --> 08:15.645
- ...she's a demon.
- I'm not surprised.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.203
John?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.369
Hi.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.444
John?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.570
Want one? Here you go.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.606
Two for one at the Shoe Warehouse.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.565
Two for one, Shoe Warehouse.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.960
Two for one at the Shoe Warehouse.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.602
So... I don't know. That's all he said.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.564
Two for one at the Shoe Warehouse.
Here you go.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.123
- One?
- No, thanks.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.604
Ali?

11:07.720 --> 11:10.803
- I was wondering where you were.
- Don't. I'm really sweaty.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.602
- How did it go?
- What?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.531
- UCLA.
- Oh, it was good.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.846
They were...

11:18.040 --> 11:21.328
- They were really receptive.
- I'm sure they were.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.682
How was Lydia?

11:23.880 --> 11:26.486
Good. You know.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.448
You guys argue?

11:30.000 --> 11:34.767
Well, we spent the whole evening
trying not to.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.922
The news that you're bankrolling
her theater company didn't help.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.088
I told you about that.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.521
- You didn't.
- I thought I did.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.566
- You didn't.
- You're not gonna like this either...

11:48.760 --> 11:50.762
but I have things to do at the lab.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.931
- Maybe walk me over there right now?
- No, I don't wanna go back to campus.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.681
I just went for a run.
I really need to be home right now.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.444
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

12:03.640 --> 12:05.927
You said we were gonna
spend the evening in.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.289
I did. We will. The sooner I go,
the sooner I'll be back...

12:09.480 --> 12:12.051
and we can watch a movie.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.325
I'm sorry. I'm just exhausted.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.843
Get some rest.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.964
Relax.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.964
I've started forgetting things,
little annoying things...

12:34.160 --> 12:35.605
like words and names.

12:35.800 --> 12:38.406
And I got lost, completely lost...

12:38.600 --> 12:39.726
running on campus.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.526
I talked to my doctor,
she said it could be menopause.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.768
Last time I'd had a period was February.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.804
But I had one again, in September,
before my birthday.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.163
Are you taking any pills,
medication, supplements?

12:51.360 --> 12:55.445
I take a multivitamin, flaxseed oil,
calcium, iron.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.246
I occasionally take a sleeping pill
when I travel.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.284
- Have you had any head injuries?
- No.

13:02.080 --> 13:06.130
Would you consider yourself depressed
or under undue stress at the moment?

13:06.320 --> 13:08.607
No. I work a lot, but I thrive on it.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.122
- How's your sleeping?
- It's fine. Like, seven hours a night.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.324
Now, I'm gonna ask you to remember
a name and an address.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.881
- I'm gonna ask you for it again later.
- Okay.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.971
John Black,
42 Washington Street, Hoboken.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.401
- Can you repeat that for me?
- John Black...

13:24.600 --> 13:26.887
42 Washington Street, Hoboken.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.606
- Good. How old are you?
- I'm 50.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.882
- What's today's date?
- November 26.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.282
- Where are we?
- We are on the third floor...

13:34.480 --> 13:36.005
of New York-Presbyterian.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.770
Can you spell "water" for me?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.764
W-A-T-E-R.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.766
- Now can you spell it for me backwards?
- R-E-T-A-W.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.770
Can you tell me what you see
on these cards?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.291
Pliers.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.323
A ladder.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.443
A sea horse.

13:52.680 --> 13:54.603
A screwdriver.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.723
An elephant.

13:57.480 --> 14:01.007
- Tell me about your parents.
- Well, they're both dead.

14:01.200 --> 14:04.966
My mother and my sister died
in a car crash when I was 18...

14:05.160 --> 14:08.289
and my father died in 1999
of liver failure.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.528
- Hepatitis?
- Cirrhosis.

14:10.720 --> 14:12.131
He was an alcoholic.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.051
And what was he like towards the end?

14:15.240 --> 14:18.323
Incoherent. Incontinent.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.000
We didn't really see
a lot of each other.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.171
He lived in New Hampshire,
and we weren't that close.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.930
Sorry.

14:27.160 --> 14:31.563
- Do you have any other siblings?
- No. I only had the one.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.805
Now, can you tell me that name and address
that I asked you to remember?

14:36.920 --> 14:38.285
John Black.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.568
And the address?

14:43.720 --> 14:45.484
Damn it, I forgot.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.569
Was it 42 Argyle Street...

14:47.760 --> 14:51.890
Cole Street, Washington Street,
or South Street?

14:53.920 --> 14:57.288
I was distracted talking about my parents.
Can we do that again?

14:57.480 --> 14:59.960
- There's no need to at this time.
- Okay.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.643
So I'd like to do an MRI,
just to rule some things out.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.120
Like what?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.800
Because I think I have a brain tumor.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.607
A precaution. But it will allow us
to see if there are any lesions...

15:11.840 --> 15:15.970
or any signs of a stroke.
Just find out what is going on in there.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.763
Okay. What should I do in the meantime?

15:21.000 --> 15:24.482
Get plenty of exercise. It's always
good to get the blood pumping.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.806
Drink lots of water.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.207
Good hydration
is excellent for the memory.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.161
Next time you come and see me,
bring in someone who knows you well?

15:32.360 --> 15:35.523
Your husband or a close relative?

15:36.320 --> 15:37.765
Sure.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.204
Stethoscope...

16:16.400 --> 16:17.765
millennium...

16:17.960 --> 16:19.724
hedgehog.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.771
Okay.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.570
Okay.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.649
Cathode.

16:32.560 --> 16:36.645
Pomegranate.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.643
Trellis.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.365
Okay.

16:49.040 --> 16:50.804
Hello.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.161
Hi. Come on in.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.004
- Hey, Mom. Hi.
- Hey, hi.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.446
Good to see you.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.642
- This is Jenny.
- Hello. I'm Alice.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.968
- I'm happy you could join us.
- Thank you.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.487
Of course.
Sweetheart, why don't you guys...

17:02.680 --> 17:05.205
go in there and get a drink,
and grab the...?

17:05.400 --> 17:07.607
The cheese thing and...

17:07.800 --> 17:08.881
- All right.
- Yeah.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.844
I'm so happy you could join us.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.963
- I really am, Jenny.
- Thank you.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.242
- It smells so good in here.
- Beautiful.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.046
- Yeah.
- That's how we do it.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.204
Okay.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.082
How many goddamn eggs?

17:31.560 --> 17:34.370
Cathode, pomegranate...

17:34.560 --> 17:36.608
trellis?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.002
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.322
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, merry Christmas.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.045
How was your flight?

17:43.240 --> 17:46.642
Actually, awful. This guy
coughed all over me the entire time.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.888
- I hope you don't get sick.
- Me too.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.367
- Does this mean what I think it means?
- Yes.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.164
- Bread pudding?
- Your favorite.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.203
- Yes.
- Mom! Merry Christmas.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.731
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.049
- Seen my latest "Words with Friends"?
- I haven't had time.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.366
- A real zinger.
- Yeah?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.284
- "Jealousy" on a triple.
- Hey!

18:03.480 --> 18:05.926
- Don't spoil it.
- Already trending on Twitter.

18:06.120 --> 18:07.451
How's California?

18:07.640 --> 18:08.687
- Nice.
- Yeah?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.166
Warmer than here?

18:10.400 --> 18:13.324
Yes. Definitely warmer than here.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.122
Hey, guys,
why don't you get out of here...

18:17.360 --> 18:19.408
so I can concentrate on making this.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.280
Okay?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.687
- Where's Dad?
- He's upstairs.

18:23.880 --> 18:24.927
Can I help you?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.322
No, I'm fine.
Go get a drink or something.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.729
- It's gonna be delicious. Yum. It will be.
- Oh, I hope so.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.325
I can't wait.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.885
- Jenny.
- Nice to meet you.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.082
Nice to meet you too.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.810
- Hi, Jenny.
- How are you?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.809
I am fine.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.240
Honestly.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.329
- Hey.
- Slider.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.521
It's a very big decision. We're excited.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.882
The place was recommended by friends...

18:53.080 --> 18:57.404
who've been trying for years,
and they just had their first child, so...

18:57.600 --> 18:58.806
So we'll see.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.526
- I've heard good things about Wellspring.
- Good.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.485
It's expensive,
but we obviously want it to work.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.444
You could be a mom already.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.846
I know.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.411
- Okay.
- Are you kidding?

19:09.600 --> 19:12.729
- What kind of soup, Mom?
- Here we go. It's butternut squash.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.804
Hi, I'm Alice.
I'm so happy you could join us.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.250
- I'm Jenny.
- It's really nice to meet you.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.568
- Yeah...
- Well, I think...

19:22.800 --> 19:25.485
I deserve a glass of wine
after that, don't you?

19:25.720 --> 19:27.768
- You want white?
- Yes. Thank you.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.088
- Does everyone have a glass?
- Yes, we do.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.285
Let's have a toast. To Christmas.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.329
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.171
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.846
Now, I don't see anything abnormal
in your MRI.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.361
No cerebral vascular disease...

19:44.560 --> 19:47.291
- ...no evidence of strokes, no masses.
- Thank God.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.211
And your blood work came back
completely clear...

19:50.400 --> 19:54.769
but what worries me
are the memory tests that I sent you for.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.244
You have sporadic memory impairment
totally out of proportion to your age.

19:59.440 --> 20:03.923
And there is evidence of decline
in your level of mental function.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.124
I think we should do a PET scan.
It's similar to an MRI...

20:07.320 --> 20:09.687
but it can pick up things
at the molecular level.

20:09.880 --> 20:14.010
I know what a PET scan is, but what
in particular would you be looking for?

20:14.800 --> 20:19.408
I wanna see if the results are consistent
with Alzheimer's disease.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.922
Now, it would be rare
for someone as young as yourself...

20:23.280 --> 20:26.363
but you do fit the criteria.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.686
Last time, I asked you
to bring a close relative.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.281
I really didn't think
that would be necessary.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.245
Okay. But next time, for sure.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.885
Okay?

20:39.200 --> 20:41.851
"Enhancement of endogenous levels
of endorphin...

20:42.040 --> 20:45.123
has not been shown
to reduce incidence of metastasis...

20:45.320 --> 20:47.084
in the distant cell sites."

20:47.280 --> 20:49.681
- That's not good.
- Tell me about it.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.087
We've been working on this for months.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.170
It seems beta endorphin
doesn't significantly impact...

20:55.360 --> 20:57.647
the microphage activity.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.042
How about the cytokines?

21:00.240 --> 21:02.971
Elevated. Slightly.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.560
Oh, God. Back to square one.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.046
Are we both here on the 17th?

21:13.880 --> 21:15.405
I don't remember.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.685
Phil and Diane were saying
they might come to town for the weekend.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.291
How long are you going
to keep at that thing?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.528
Till it's clean.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.330
John?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.847
John, sweetheart, wake up.

22:37.040 --> 22:40.328
- What time is it?
- I need to talk to you.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.930
I've...

22:44.840 --> 22:47.446
I've got something wrong with me.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.643
What are you talking about?

22:51.840 --> 22:54.605
I've been seeing a neurologist.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.606
You've been seeing a neurologist? Why?

22:57.800 --> 23:01.850
They think that it might be
early onset Alzheimer's disease.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.650
Ali, Ali, that doesn't make
any sense at all.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.763
They don't know anything for sure.

23:09.960 --> 23:12.964
But I've been doing all these tests
and I'm really scared.

23:13.200 --> 23:17.922
- Ali, that is completely insane.
- I got...

23:18.160 --> 23:21.687
I got lost while I was running
on campus a while ago. I can't...

23:21.920 --> 23:26.130
I can't remember appointments, words.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.288
Honey, we all have memory lapses.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.006
That's a sign of getting older.
The other day...

23:31.200 --> 23:34.283
I couldn't remember the word "glucose."

23:34.480 --> 23:35.641
It's not like that.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.923
It's like something just drop...
Drops out under me.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.208
- But there is no diagnosis yet?
- No.

23:42.440 --> 23:46.445
Okay. Well, then I think that this
is ridiculous. It's complete bullshit.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.883
- You don't have Alzheimer's.
- Why won't you take me seriously?

23:50.080 --> 23:51.525
I know what I'm feeling.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.441
I know what it's feeling, and it feels
like my brain is fucking dying.

23:55.640 --> 23:59.361
And everything I've worked for
in my entire life is going.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.130
It's all... All going.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.845
No.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.521
Come here.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.209
Don't cry.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.168
Most of them are still awaiting trial.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.931
They have not been found guilty.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.806
Last year, officials at Rikers reported
to the Board of Corrections...

24:30.000 --> 24:33.482
- ...that on a typical day...
- What time is your tutorial?

24:33.680 --> 24:35.364
Eleven.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.722
Well, that gives you some time.

24:39.520 --> 24:43.684
I'm gonna be a little late
because I have a departmental meeting.

24:43.880 --> 24:46.724
When I come back, we can go
to dinner, have Thai food?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.405
Yeah, okay.

24:51.760 --> 24:54.161
I'm okay. I just...

24:55.520 --> 24:58.490
Last night just got
the better of me, that's all.

24:58.720 --> 25:03.009
Well, two things: I think it's way too early
to jump to any conclusions...

25:05.680 --> 25:07.887
and whatever happens, I'm here.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.321
You can clearly see in here...

25:12.520 --> 25:16.366
The red areas are high in beta-amyloid.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.486
The buildup has probably been ongoing
for several years.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.006
I'm sorry.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.765
There is evidence
of high amyloid in older people...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.241
with normal cognitive function, correct?

25:29.880 --> 25:32.884
Yes, but not in someone
as young as Alice.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.847
Well, at least
it would be extremely rare.

25:36.040 --> 25:39.487
High amyloid is associated
with conditions other than Alzheimer's.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.848
Unfortunately, in Alice's case...

25:42.040 --> 25:45.522
this corroborates the clinical symptoms
that she is presenting.

25:45.720 --> 25:48.724
Shouldn't any diagnosis be accompanied
by a genetic test?

25:48.920 --> 25:52.402
- Hold on a minute, please.
- Actually, I was gonna suggest that.

25:52.600 --> 25:55.524
In a case like this,
with the onset being so early...

25:55.720 --> 26:00.442
we would like to check for presenilin
mutations that would be an indicator...

26:00.640 --> 26:04.804
of familial Alzheimer's disease,
which is a rarer form.

26:05.040 --> 26:06.849
We can make an appointment for you.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.721
- So this concerns my children?
- Yes.

26:10.960 --> 26:14.328
I assume that if I have the gene...

26:14.520 --> 26:17.364
the odds of my passing it along
are fifty-fifty.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.800
I'm afraid so.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.449
And if they are carriers, what are the odds
of them developing the disease?

26:23.680 --> 26:26.331
I'm afraid it's a hundred percent.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.529
Radiology technician,
please dial extension to 256.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.411
The kids will all be here
for our anniversary.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.365
I don't think we should tell them,
not until we have the results.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.326
We will by then, if I go in next week.
I wanna know as soon as possible.

26:43.520 --> 26:47.684
Where the hell is this goddamn elevator?
Here we are in a major hospital.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.962
- Only one elevator running?
- It's okay.

26:50.160 --> 26:53.881
- We could've taken the stairs by now.
- It doesn't matter.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.208
Going down.

27:05.880 --> 27:10.841
Well, everybody...

27:11.040 --> 27:12.405
What's going on?

27:15.720 --> 27:18.803
- Oh, boy.
- Are you guys gonna break up or...?

27:19.000 --> 27:20.764
No.

27:21.720 --> 27:26.601
- No, it's nothing like that. It...
- Mom, are you sick?

27:31.320 --> 27:34.483
I have been seeing a neurologist
for the past few months...

27:34.680 --> 27:37.968
and I have Alzheimer's disease.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.850
Early onset.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.930
That... That doesn't make sense.
Are...? Are you sure?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.851
There is no doubt. She has the disease.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.122
But at her age, it's...

27:48.320 --> 27:50.322
It is rare, but it has been confirmed.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.562
- Yeah.
- You're so young, Mom.

27:55.520 --> 27:59.570
- I don't understand that.
- I had noticed one or two things.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.570
You didn't know Tom's girlfriend
when she came over...

28:02.760 --> 28:05.491
- Lydia.
- What medications are you on?

28:05.680 --> 28:08.126
Right now, I'm on Aricept and Namenda.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.004
They can help slow the progress?

28:10.200 --> 28:12.009
- Well, no.
- I'm afraid not.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.929
Help alleviate the symptoms...

28:14.120 --> 28:17.090
- ...but they can't prevent the disease.
- The thing is...

28:17.280 --> 28:20.204
that the type of Alzheimer's I have...

28:20.400 --> 28:23.927
is very rare.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.131
- It's familial. It's passed on genetically.
- Oh, my God.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.687
We believe that she got it
from her father...

28:32.880 --> 28:36.043
and of course, we're very worried
about the three of you.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.322
Now, there is a test you can take...

28:38.520 --> 28:43.287
but it's completely up to you
whether you wanna find out or not.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.209
I'm sorry.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.329
I'm so...

29:45.360 --> 29:49.490
Can anyone tell me what it says
in the syllabus for today?

29:51.680 --> 29:52.841
Phonology.

29:53.040 --> 29:56.522
And can anyone tell me
what phonology is?

30:02.720 --> 30:06.611
"Phono" is from the Greek word "phoné,"
meaning "sound"...

30:06.800 --> 30:11.283
and phonology, broadly speaking,
is the study of the sounds of language.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.801
It should be distinguished
from phonetics...

30:27.000 --> 30:28.764
Hi, Anna.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.291
Hi, Mom.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.482
Are you okay?

30:33.000 --> 30:36.288
I got the results. I'm positive.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.842
Oh, God, Anna.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.323
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:43.520 --> 30:47.730
Tom turned out negative,
and Lydia didn't wanna know.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.365
But I'm positive.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.961
Baby, how are you feeling?

30:52.360 --> 30:54.203
I'm okay.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.964
One good thing, at least I found out now
before the next IUI session.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.083
I guess they can test the embryos...

31:02.280 --> 31:04.806
so they can be sure
the babies will be okay.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.130
I'm on my way to a lecture, but I can
cancel it and I can be right there.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.120
No, no, Mom, it's okay.
I'm with Charlie. I'm okay.

31:13.320 --> 31:17.086
No, I want to. I can...
I... I want to be there. I can come.

31:17.280 --> 31:21.251
No, please don't worry. I'll be fine.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.530
Okay.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.607
I love you, sweetheart.

31:26.920 --> 31:28.729
I love you.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.849
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:12.960 --> 32:17.010
"I had been looking forward to this course,
but I was disappointed.

32:17.240 --> 32:22.565
The content was often muddled
and delivered with little focus or care.

32:22.960 --> 32:27.045
Class was a waste of time. I ended up
just following the online version.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.164
I found Linguistics 201 very erratic.

32:30.360 --> 32:34.160
I had a hard time
following Dr. Howland's lectures.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.886
Even she seems
like she gets lost in them."

32:37.080 --> 32:43.008
Eric, I am so sorry. I... I didn't know
the students felt this way.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.762
Obviously, I will... I will make adjustments
and we can reevaluate my performance.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.645
Everything all right at home?
Between you and John?

32:50.840 --> 32:53.969
- Yes, everything's fine.
- Is it something we can help with?

32:54.200 --> 32:55.964
- Stress, depression?
- No, no, no.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.646
- Substance abuse? Alcohol?
- No. No. God, Eric.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.605
No, it's... It's nothing
like that. I... it's...

33:01.800 --> 33:06.169
It's medical.
It's a... It's a medical issue...

33:06.360 --> 33:10.081
and I admit I had a hard time
teaching last semester...

33:10.280 --> 33:12.647
and I wasn't aware
of how much it showed.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.690
Alice, I'm not following.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.247
I have mild cognitive impairment.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.647
Would you unpack that for me?

33:22.840 --> 33:26.686
In February, I was diagnosed
with early onset Alzheimer's disease.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.244
What?

33:29.640 --> 33:33.565
- Alice, oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- It's early. It's still early stages.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.206
It will limit my ability
as time goes on...

33:36.400 --> 33:39.643
- but for now, I feel capable...
- There's no need to...

33:39.840 --> 33:43.162
I mean, we don't want you
under any undue stress.

33:43.360 --> 33:46.443
- That would be counterproductive.
- I can handle the stress.

33:46.640 --> 33:51.282
I would like to remain in the department
for as long as we all think is possible.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.366
Well, I'll have to let the department
and the faculty know.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.721
Yes, of course.

33:59.920 --> 34:02.730
I am so, so sorry.

34:48.199 --> 34:53.491
I'll have a regular
with blueberries and coconut, please.

35:08.240 --> 35:09.480
Hi.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.727
Alice, where the hell were you?

35:12.960 --> 35:14.121
I went for a run.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.051
You've been gone for over two hours.
I was worried.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.049
Well, then I went to Pinkberry.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.811
- You went to Pinkberry?
- Yeah.

35:22.160 --> 35:26.688
Well, I hope you enjoyed that because
you completely blew our dinner plans.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.047
Susan Kirby and her husband.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.081
I'm sorry. I forgot.

35:35.680 --> 35:37.728
I have Alzheimer's.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.524
I texted you, I e-mailed you.

35:39.720 --> 35:42.291
- There are ways to manage...
- I said I was sorry.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.960
She's the chair of my department.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.885
I had no idea where you were,
if something happened.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.283
- Why didn't you bring your phone?
- I can't when I'm running.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.801
Wear a fanny pack.
Is it that inhibiting?

35:54.040 --> 35:55.530
Yes.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.811
- I hate that this is happening to me.
- I hate it too.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.684
We have to keep the important things
in our life going.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.087
We have to try
or we're going to go crazy.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.691
I know. I know, John.

36:11.880 --> 36:15.965
I am, I'm sorry, but I don't know what
I would've been like at a dinner party.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.562
I might not be able to remember names
or answer simple questions.

36:19.760 --> 36:22.764
- Never mind get through an anecdote.
- You're doing great.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.166
Relative to what?

36:27.600 --> 36:30.001
I wish I had cancer.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.286
Don't say that.

36:32.480 --> 36:35.609
No, I do. I mean it.
I mean, I wouldn't feel so ashamed.

36:35.800 --> 36:38.690
People have cancer,
they wear pink ribbons for you...

36:38.920 --> 36:43.005
and go on long walks, and raise money...

36:43.200 --> 36:47.967
and you don't have to feel
like some kind of a social...

36:50.360 --> 36:52.488
I can't remember the word.

37:01.360 --> 37:07.003
In 2013, we completed exterior repairs,
and inside, we replaced the elevators...

37:07.240 --> 37:10.403
refurbished the auditorium,
the library and lounge area...

37:10.600 --> 37:13.524
- ...and upgraded our HVAC system.
- Well, that's good.

37:13.720 --> 37:16.326
We also took away
a lot of the old security doors.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.682
Residents are issued a bracelet
instead...

37:18.920 --> 37:23.721
which keeps them from using elevators or
leaving the building, depending on their level.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.207
I don't know if you've experienced this
with your parent...

37:26.400 --> 37:29.643
but they get nighttime restlessness
and wandering.

37:29.840 --> 37:33.845
We can prevent their elopement
without patients feeling they're locked in.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.087
I see.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.808
We saw that large group activities
left most of the residents unengaged...

37:40.000 --> 37:44.324
and even distressed by the confusion
they experienced from all the stimulation.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.761
So we redefined activities...

37:46.960 --> 37:51.010
to include all interactions
between staff and residents in the unit.

37:51.240 --> 37:55.325
Staff looks for opportunities to make
meaningful connections with residents...

37:55.520 --> 37:59.969
starting with knowing about the person
and what makes them comfortable.

38:00.160 --> 38:05.200
One woman who had worked as a nurse sat,
most days, in the nursing station, writing notes.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.447
Heartbreaking.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.684
Yes, but it's a behavior
we see time and again.

38:09.880 --> 38:12.201
We don't have restrictions
on visiting times.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.721
Family and friends
are welcome day or night.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.242
- Doesn't look like anybody's here.
- Sunday is the day they come.

38:18.480 --> 38:19.925
- What's that?
- Chair alarm.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.487
Certain residents have them
so we know they're up.

38:22.680 --> 38:25.081
- She all right?
- Just a precautionary measure.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.926
- Get me to Penn Station.
- It's all women.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.283
We do have mainly female residents
here, but there are men.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.960
There's William.
William was part of the team...

38:34.200 --> 38:37.044
that sent the first satellite
into orbit.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.811
They just aren't powerful enough
to put me to sleep.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.570
Do you want to try Lunesta?

38:54.760 --> 38:56.285
What about Rohypnol?

38:56.520 --> 38:57.726
That's very strong.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.048
I need something strong.

39:10.360 --> 39:11.805
Hi, Alice.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.369
I am you and I have something
very important to say to you.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.370
So you've reached the point
where you can no longer answer...

39:20.800 --> 39:22.165
any of the questions.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.489
So this is the next logical step.

39:25.680 --> 39:27.489
I'm sure of it.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.524
In your bedroom there's a dresser
with a blue lamp.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.849
Open the top drawer.

39:33.040 --> 39:36.203
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

39:36.400 --> 39:39.290
It says, "Take all pills with water."

39:39.520 --> 39:42.126
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle...

39:42.320 --> 39:45.767
but it's very important
that you swallow them all.

39:47.880 --> 39:52.283
Okay? And then lie down and go to sleep.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.725
And don't tell anyone what you're doing.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.522
Ali!

41:34.760 --> 41:36.603
Ali!

41:44.920 --> 41:46.206
Oh, I love it here.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.204
Me too.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.920
- Remember Santorini?
- Santorini.

42:11.120 --> 42:15.967
- Can you believe that was 30 years ago?
- Don't do that to me. Oh, my God.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.367
Oh, it was a complicated time, huh?

42:18.560 --> 42:21.404
You were dealing with a lot.
What was it, a year after?

42:21.640 --> 42:24.211
- Yeah, something like that.
- Yeah.

42:24.400 --> 42:28.724
I know I've said this, but I am sorry I
never got to meet your mom or your sister.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.729
Me too.

42:31.520 --> 42:33.010
We had a great time, though.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.888
- Yeah.
- Don't you wish we had more of that?

42:38.480 --> 42:41.609
If you mean blow jobs
on the beach, yes, I...

42:41.800 --> 42:44.246
- Yeah, but, you know.
- I do wish we had more.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.602
Yeah, all of it.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.969
It all happened so fast, you know.

42:49.160 --> 42:51.640
Anna was born, our careers.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.484
Well, you were relentless.

42:53.680 --> 42:56.684
You wanted everything and all at once.

42:56.920 --> 43:00.527
That's how I am. That's how I like it.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.369
Anna's the same way, right?

43:03.920 --> 43:06.207
I like you the way you are.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.922
I like everything about you.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.282
Thank God you do.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.285
This is so great, you know.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.766
I kind of like it.

43:19.960 --> 43:22.884
Being liberated from Columbia.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.090
Why don't you take a sabbatical
next year?

43:26.640 --> 43:30.440
And we're gonna do what,
drive around the country in an RV?

43:30.720 --> 43:34.406
Sure. I don't know,
we could spend more time here.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.647
Go to Bhutan.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.601
Well, I think our summer on the island
is all the excitement I can handle.

43:39.840 --> 43:42.320
Okay. Well, you know what?

43:42.520 --> 43:46.286
This might be the last year
that I'm myself, you know?

43:51.840 --> 43:53.922
Please don't say that.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.289
John?

44:19.480 --> 44:21.289
I'm over here.

44:21.480 --> 44:25.371
Oh, hey, when are you going
to the conference?

44:26.880 --> 44:28.211
On Monday.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.324
- And when is Lydia coming?
- Lydia comes on Sunday.

44:31.560 --> 44:34.040
She doesn't have to come
just to babysit me.

44:34.520 --> 44:37.603
She's coming to do the Chekhov play
at Saugatuck, remember?

44:38.320 --> 44:40.288
- Right.
- When I get finished...

44:40.480 --> 44:44.007
- ...are we gonna go for a run?
- Yeah, I need to grab another layer.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.651
Okay.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.929
- Hey, are we still going running?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, look.

45:31.160 --> 45:33.527
Look, I found this photo album...

45:33.720 --> 45:36.849
with these pictures
of my mother and my sister.

45:37.880 --> 45:40.645
Hey, when are you going
to the conference?

45:41.560 --> 45:44.086
- Monday.
- And when is Lydia coming?

45:44.280 --> 45:46.408
Lydia's coming on Sunday.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.170
Okay.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.129
- Are we going running?
- Yes.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.288
Yes, we are. I just have to go pee.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.170
I'll be right back.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.970
Ali?

47:07.200 --> 47:09.601
I couldn't find the bathroom.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.844
It's okay, baby.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.364
I don't know where I am.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.644
- I like that necklace.
- You do?

47:38.840 --> 47:40.205
- Yeah.
- Haven't seen this?

47:40.400 --> 47:41.845
Nope.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.721
My mother gave it to me.

47:45.360 --> 47:48.091
When I was a little girl...

47:48.280 --> 47:52.126
like, in second grade,
my teacher told me...

47:52.320 --> 47:55.722
butterflies don't live a long time.
They live, like, a month.

47:55.920 --> 47:59.686
And I was so upset, and I went home,
and I told my mother, and she said:

47:59.880 --> 48:03.009
"Yeah, but, you know,
they have a nice life.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.487
They have a really beautiful life."

48:05.680 --> 48:10.129
So now it always makes me think about
my mother's life, and my sister's life.

48:10.360 --> 48:14.809
And to a certain extent,
you know, my own.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.808
- You are gonna be around for a long time, Mom.
- Yes, yes.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.168
There's some things I wanna do,
you know?

48:24.360 --> 48:28.126
I wanna take a sabbatical with Daddy.
I don't think that's gonna happen.

48:28.320 --> 48:32.882
And I wanna see Anna have a baby,
and I wanna see Tom graduate.

48:33.080 --> 48:36.971
- You will.
- And I'd like to see you go to college.

48:39.640 --> 48:43.326
Not for law or medicine or anything,
but for drama.

48:43.560 --> 48:46.370
And if the acting thing
doesn't work out, you could...

48:46.560 --> 48:50.724
You could teach or do workshops.
You'd have some kind of a backup plan.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.604
Yeah.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.841
I don't want a backup plan.

48:56.520 --> 48:57.726
I...

48:57.920 --> 49:00.022
I wanna do this.
I'm gonna give it a shot.

49:00.123 --> 49:02.806
It's not gonna happen
if I don't believe in myself.

49:03.200 --> 49:06.807
I believe in you, Lydia.
I do, I believe in you.

49:07.040 --> 49:09.850
It's just that, you know, life is tough.

49:10.040 --> 49:12.964
It is tougher than you know.

49:13.160 --> 49:14.321
And I...

49:14.520 --> 49:18.684
I just... I want you to have
some kind of security before I go.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.762
Mom, for God...

49:22.000 --> 49:23.650
You have to...

49:25.200 --> 49:28.522
You can't use your situation
to just get me to do everything...

49:28.720 --> 49:30.802
- ...you want me to do.
- Why can't I?

49:31.000 --> 49:33.844
- Because that's not fair.
- I don't have to be fair.

49:34.040 --> 49:35.929
I'm your mother.

49:36.560 --> 49:39.404
- Right?
- Yeah.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.925
- Hey.
- What's going on?

50:23.160 --> 50:25.447
I'm just working, how about you?

50:26.240 --> 50:28.129
Nothing.

50:30.560 --> 50:32.050
I need something to read.

50:32.240 --> 50:36.131
- I thought you were reading Moby-Dick.
- Yeah, I was...

50:36.320 --> 50:41.281
but I got tired of reading the same page
over and over again. I can't focus.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.165
Well, that happens to me
when I read Moby-Dick too.

50:44.360 --> 50:47.887
- Why don't you try something lighter?
- Like The Cat in the Hat?

50:48.080 --> 50:50.686
How about one of those plays
Lydia has downstairs?

50:50.880 --> 50:53.201
They're quicker, they're easier to read.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.364
It might give the two of you
something to talk about.

51:01.680 --> 51:03.648
Okay.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.406
You work all the time.

52:10.640 --> 52:15.168
What I liked about it was how...

52:15.400 --> 52:18.802
How big, how...

52:19.000 --> 52:24.006
How wide the scape of it was.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.844
Yeah. The scope of it.

52:26.080 --> 52:28.686
The scope, that's the word.
Oh, God, listen to me.

52:28.880 --> 52:31.406
It's unbelievable you had to live
through that.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.924
You must have known...

52:34.120 --> 52:36.441
Must have known somebody
that died from AIDS.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.122
Oh, yeah, honey. Everybody did.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.206
We lost a lot of people.

52:44.760 --> 52:46.524
What did you think?

52:46.760 --> 52:49.730
I mean, you and Malcolm
played the Mormons, right?

52:49.920 --> 52:53.003
The husband and wife?
You did scenes in your acting class.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.009
Yeah, how'd you know that?

52:56.600 --> 52:58.967
I don't know, you must have told me.

52:59.560 --> 53:01.483
I didn't tell you.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.731
Well, then...

53:04.000 --> 53:05.809
I don't know how I know it.

53:07.440 --> 53:08.930
Mom, did you read my journal?

53:14.200 --> 53:16.009
Why?

53:16.200 --> 53:18.771
- Why would you do that, Mom?
- Oh, gosh.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.571
I am so sorry.

53:21.800 --> 53:25.327
Lydia, I honestly didn't understand
what I was reading.

53:25.520 --> 53:28.967
You didn't understand "Lydia Howland"
written across the front?

53:29.160 --> 53:32.243
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I...
- I don't believe you.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.965
I didn't mean to.

53:34.360 --> 53:35.521
Okay, it's fine.

53:35.720 --> 53:37.290
I just can't...

53:37.520 --> 53:40.444
- Lydia, I didn't... I really didn't know.
- Just stop!

53:40.640 --> 53:42.961
I wouldn't do that to you.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.681
- So you can't eat this.
- No, I know.

53:47.880 --> 53:51.805
No sushi, not hot do...
Hot dogs are the worst. I love hot dogs.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.565
- No alcohol.
- No alcohol.

53:53.760 --> 53:55.842
- No cigarettes.
- Never even smoked.

53:56.080 --> 53:57.525
Well, you... I mean...

53:57.720 --> 54:00.690
- Never had one cigarette in your life?
- Not one.

54:00.920 --> 54:02.570
We can't be too careful.

54:02.800 --> 54:06.885
He even grabbed my hand the other day
as we were walking down the stairs.

54:07.080 --> 54:11.244
- Just trying to protect my investment.
- Anna, return my "Words with Friends."

54:11.440 --> 54:13.920
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom. I haven't had time.

54:14.800 --> 54:15.847
- Yeah.
- Hey.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.168
- Congrats.
- Hey, hey. Thank you.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.810
- There you are.
- Thanks. So twins, huh?

54:23.120 --> 54:25.600
- Yes, a boy and a girl.
- Kind of perfect.

54:25.800 --> 54:28.963
- What your mother and I were hoping for.
- It's so wonderful.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.565
Oh, gosh.

54:30.760 --> 54:33.604
I'm sorry, I've gotta take this. Hello?

54:33.800 --> 54:35.768
- How far along are you?
- Five weeks.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.243
Right now, it's very early days, but...

54:39.440 --> 54:42.808
Well, the timing of things,
how we found out and when we did...

54:43.000 --> 54:45.924
- ...well, it really worked out in the end.
- Great.

54:46.360 --> 54:49.204
- That's amazing.
- So, Mom, how you feeling?

54:49.400 --> 54:50.925
- Mostly fine.
- Really?

54:51.120 --> 54:54.841
Yeah, I use this thing,
you know, instead of a memory.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.725
Reminds me to take my medication,
things like that.

54:57.920 --> 55:00.002
It's nice how the technology can help.

55:00.200 --> 55:04.125
- I think it has the same...
- Lydia, what time is your play?

55:04.480 --> 55:05.561
Eight o'clock.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.728
- Nervous about tomorrow night?
- Yes.

55:07.920 --> 55:10.605
I'll be fine,
but I'll have to block you out.

55:10.800 --> 55:12.529
I'm sorry. What time again?

55:12.720 --> 55:14.085
- Eight o'clock.
- Okay.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.001
- You don't have to schedule it.
- I wanna put it in. And where is it?

55:18.200 --> 55:20.202
- The Saugatuck Theater.
- Can you spell that?

55:20.400 --> 55:22.767
- S-A-U...
- Mom, we're not gonna forget you.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.286
Just let her do it.

55:24.480 --> 55:27.404
- It's S-A-U-G-A-T-U-C-K.
- Oh, God.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.204
- Anna, you're not helping.
- You're not.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.801
Why worry about remembering something
she doesn't have to?

55:32.000 --> 55:33.968
If you just let her, she won't worry.

55:34.360 --> 55:37.603
You don't have to talk about her
like she's not sitting here.

55:37.800 --> 55:41.009
- I'm not, I'm talking to her. Aren't I, Mom?
- Yes, you are.

55:41.200 --> 55:43.646
- Yes, and what makes you an expert?
- Shut up.

55:43.840 --> 55:45.171
- Grow up, Lydia.
- Suck it.

55:45.400 --> 55:46.731
That's very articulate.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.365
Girls, girls, you know...

55:48.560 --> 55:50.688
- Are you kidding me?
- That's enough.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.928
- Stop it, please.
- You shut up.

55:53.160 --> 55:56.050
- No, both of you, stop it.
- What is going on here?

55:57.920 --> 56:00.685
Alice, this is a beautiful spread.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.368
Thank you, Charlie.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.642
- Very valuable...
- Lydia, baby, I know that we argued...

56:07.880 --> 56:09.530
about something yesterday...

56:09.760 --> 56:13.082
but I can't remember what it was about.

56:14.960 --> 56:17.964
- It was nothing, honestly.
- No, I upset you.

56:18.160 --> 56:22.290
And I should apologize.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.048
No, no.

56:27.240 --> 56:28.480
I should apologize.

56:28.680 --> 56:29.966
I'm...

56:30.640 --> 56:34.087
I feel really bad.
I was so insensitive yesterday.

56:36.800 --> 56:38.609
Will you forgive me, honestly?

56:39.480 --> 56:41.244
But for what?

56:41.440 --> 56:47.891
It was about you respecting my privacy,
and I don't want that.

56:48.080 --> 56:50.970
And I take it back completely.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.484
And I'm sorry, okay?

56:53.920 --> 56:55.729
I'm sorry.

56:59.640 --> 57:02.041
It's not as if I can remember it.

57:02.600 --> 57:06.286
Yeah, I know, right?
That's why I tried to drop it.

57:13.480 --> 57:15.403
What's it like?

57:17.160 --> 57:19.731
Like, what does it actually feel like?

57:21.520 --> 57:24.364
Well, it's not always the same.

57:24.560 --> 57:28.360
You know, I have...
I have good days and bad days.

57:28.560 --> 57:35.250
And on my good days, I can, you know,
almost pass for a normal person.

57:35.440 --> 57:40.321
But on my bad days,
I feel like I can't find myself.

57:42.160 --> 57:48.725
I've always been so defined
by my intellect...

57:48.920 --> 57:52.766
my language, my articulation...

57:52.960 --> 57:56.965
and now, sometimes, I can see
the words hanging in front of me...

57:57.200 --> 57:59.851
and I can't reach them.
I don't know who I am...

58:00.080 --> 58:02.606
and I don't know
what I'm gonna lose next.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.289
That sounds horrible.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.803
Thanks for asking.

58:46.240 --> 58:48.322
Oh, Lydia.

58:50.280 --> 58:52.408
They're leaving us.

58:52.760 --> 58:54.524
One has quite left us.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.240
Quite and forever.

58:57.440 --> 59:01.161
We alone remain
to begin our lives over again.

59:01.360 --> 59:02.930
We must live.

59:03.120 --> 59:05.361
We must live.

59:06.120 --> 59:09.966
There will come a time
when we all will know why...

59:10.720 --> 59:13.849
for what purpose
there is all of this suffering...

59:15.640 --> 59:18.086
and there will be no mystery.

59:18.480 --> 59:20.164
But now we must live.

59:20.360 --> 59:24.570
We must work, just work.

59:25.760 --> 59:28.161
Tomorrow I'll go off on my own
and I'll teach.

59:28.360 --> 59:32.331
I'll give everything I have
to those who might, perhaps, need it.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.168
It's autumn now.

59:36.960 --> 59:40.851
Soon it will be winter.
The snow will cover everything.

59:41.680 --> 59:43.762
And I'll be working.

59:45.880 --> 59:47.803
Just working.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.003
There she is. Hey, you were amazing.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.328
Yes, you were so good.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:18.206
- Incredible.
- You killed it, totally.

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.850
Miss Howland,
would you sign this for me?

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.728
It was just wonderful.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.764
I... I found it so easy
to empathize with her.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:33.249
You... You really caught her despair,
but also her joy.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.330
Thank you. Awesome.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.729
Will we get to see you in anything else
this summer?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.648
No, this is the only job I got.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.684
Oh, so you're here for just the season.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.487
- Yeah.
- Mom. Mom.

01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.124
This is Lydia, your daughter.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.524
No, I... I know that.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.642
Thanks for coming. Weird, embarrassing.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:09.367
Don't be embarrassed.
Don't, please. Please don't be.

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.250
Giraffe.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.528
Hammer.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.002
Comb.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.564
Oh, I know what that is.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.366
It is like a chicken, but it's not.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.204
It is a duck.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:28.686
How about this one?

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.041
A basketball.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:35.362
- Can you spell water for me backwards?
- Could I spell it forward first?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.405
W-A-T-E-R.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.210
R-E-T-A-W.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.606
That's very good.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.122
Now, can you tell me that name
I asked you to remember?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.449
You always tell me,
and I can never remember it.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.363
Was it John Black, John White,
John Jones, or John Smith?

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.607
Smith?

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.208
And his address, was it East Street,
Washington Street...

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.801
Humboldt Street, or Main Street?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.324
Just to jump in here, we're both
concerned about the rate of deterioration.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.042
- Is that normal?
- Well, every case is different.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.881
With familial early onset,
things can go fast.

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:27.007
And with people who have a high level
of education, things can go faster.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.324
They've managed to sustain
their mental processes...

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.730
through innovative means
and that delays diagnosis.

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:39.448
Now, clearly, Alice's memory is failing,
but she's still incredibly resourceful.

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.005
Thank you.

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.487
I know you're... You're discouraged...

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.123
but sometimes I've seen patients
plateau at this point.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.129
Don't lose hope.

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.326
I read your name in the Alzheimer's
Association Care Conference brochure.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.766
- You're gonna give a speech.
- Will you be there?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.809
Yes. I'm looking forward to it.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:04.090
I'm going to be away on business
in Minnesota, and I'm worried.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.001
Are you sure this is a good idea,
considering the state that she's in?

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.488
- She's gonna be under a lot of stress.
- It'll be great for her.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.963
Everything will be fine.
But you're not worried about it...

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.209
- ...are you, Alice?
- No, I don't think so.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.046
"...various ways to prevent
the production of amyloid...

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.129
are being tried.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:29.125
There is a new study...

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.843
that combines base and gamma
secretase inhibitors...

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.722
and this is one of our best hopes
for the future."

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.167
That's it. That's the end.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.204
It's good, Mom. It's good.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.123
- It's very scientific.
- Yes, well, you know.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:52.803
Yeah. And I'm sure it's valid, but...

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.525
But what?

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.401
I mean, is there any value
in making it a bit more personal?

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.689
I don't understand what you mean.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.726
You know, you're not speaking
to a room of scientists.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.323
What I wanna know, really, is, like,
how you feel, what does it feel like?

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.682
What does this disease mean to you?

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.486
You weren't listening
because that's all there.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.170
That's in the speech.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:17.725
Okay.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:22.969
- Don't ask me, then.
- Oh, no, then I won't ask, then.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.125
Hey.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.570
Mom. Just give it one more shot, okay?

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.761
I can't because I have done it already.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.247
I... I use this...

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.925
Yellow... Yellow thingy to mark it...

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:51.685
so I don't have to read the same line
over and over and over and over again.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.041
Got it. Totally.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.328
Just print out one more.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.443
It took me three days to write this.

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.361
- You can print out one more.
- No, it took me three days.

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.288
- Sorry.
- Three days.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.326
Here you are.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.171
Thank you.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.848
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.408
- Hello there.
- Hello.

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.769
Hi. Oh, Tom, this is my doctor.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.371
- My son.
- Travis Benjamin.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.040
- I'm your mother's neurologist.
- My son, Tom.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:00.050
- Pleasure.
- So how you feeling, Alice?

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.890
I think I'm nervous.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.731
You're gonna do great. Break a leg.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.002
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.122
It is a great honor to welcome
our next speaker, Alice Howland.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.966
A former professor of linguistics
at Columbia...

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.285
she's written textbooks
and has lectured all over the world.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.926
Alice is living
with early onset Alzheimer's...

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.448
with the care and support
of her loving family.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.883
Please welcome Alice Howland.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:43.601
Please give me just a minute.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.644
"Good morning.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.320
It's an honor to be here.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.242
The poet Elizabeth Bishop once wrote:

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:03.604
'The art of losing isn't hard to master.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.600
So many things seem filled
with the intent to be lost...

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.804
that their loss is no disaster.'

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.724
I am not a poet.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.851
I am a person living
with early onset Alzheimer's.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:24.049
And as that person, I find myself
learning the art of losing every day.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.006
Losing my bearings,
losing objects, losing sleep...

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.726
but mostly, losing memories."

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.724
Oh, no.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.524
Thank you.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.608
I think I'll try to forget
that just happened.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:00.121
"All my life, I've accumulated memories.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.609
They've become, in a way,
my most precious possessions.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.201
The night I met my husband...

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.329
the first time I held my textbook
in my hands...

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:18.720
having children, making friends,
traveling the world.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.002
Everything I accumulated in life...

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.166
everything I've worked so hard for...

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:27.921
now all that is being ripped away.

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:34.566
As you can imagine or as you know,
this is hell.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.169
But it gets worse.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.484
Who can take us seriously...

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.644
when we are so far
from who we once were?

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.685
Our strange behavior
and fumbled sentences...

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.729
change others' perceptions of us
and our perception of ourselves.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.246
We become ridiculous, incapable, comic.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.801
But this is not who we are.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.764
This is our disease.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:10.760
And like any disease, it has a cause...

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.127
it has a progression...

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:16.051
and it could have a cure.

01:09:16.439 --> 01:09:20.649
My greatest wish is that my children...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.609
our children, the next generation,
do not have to face what I am facing.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.560
But for the time being, I'm still alive.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.401
I know I'm alive.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.805
I have people I love dearly.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.203
I have things I wanna do with my life.

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:45.321
I rail against myself
for not being able to remember things...

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.651
but I still have moments in the day
of pure happiness and joy.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.526
And please,
do not think that I am suffering.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.201
I am not suffering.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.129
I am struggling.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.927
Struggling to be a part of things...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.126
to stay connected to who I once was.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.450
'So live in the moment, ' I tell myself.

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.047
It's really all I can do.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.208
Live in the moment.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.081
And not beat myself up too much...

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.927
And not beat myself up too much...

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:29.011
for mastering the art of losing.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.285
One thing I will try to hold on to, though,
is the memory of speaking here today.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.526
It will go.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.768
I know it will.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.971
It may be gone by tomorrow...

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:49.966
but it means so much
to be talking here today...

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:52.641
like my old, ambitious self...

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.320
who was so fascinated by communication."

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.851
Thank you for this opportunity.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.961
It means the world to me.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.649
Thank you.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.362
It's the Mayo Clinic.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.882
It would start up next spring.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.361
And I'd be heading up my own team.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:59.450
So you want us to move to...?

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.930
It's in Rochester, Minnesota.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.171
Well, it could be
a whole new adventure for us.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.081
- You might even like it there.
- Everything I know is here.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.569
Anna and Tom
and the babies that are coming.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.361
It's just a two-hour flight.
We'd see them as often as we do now.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.405
Ali, this just came up...

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.281
and they haven't even made
a formal offer, but don't you see?

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.729
This is it. They're working
on many cutting-edge treatments.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:28.888
- They've got resources.
- I understand.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.845
I understand that work is important.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.566
I miss working.

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:41.483
I think you should ask them
if you can start in a year.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.286
It's not academia.
They don't give sabbaticals.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.451
But to pick up and move...

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.167
right when... When... When...

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.689
Why can't I say what I wanna say?

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.690
Ali, one way or the other,
we'll still be together.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.804
So no time off?

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.163
I can't take a year off.
Financially, that's not an option...

01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.404
and God knows where we'll be
further down the line.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.443
That's it then. That's it.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.361
- What?
- Well, you don't... You don't want that.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.804
A year at home with me, watching this.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.486
I didn't say that.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.682
You didn't have to.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.171
Ali, what are you doing?

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.646
I can't find it.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.207
- You can't find what?
- I can't find my phone.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.086
- It's the middle of the night.
- It's important. It goes off at 8:00...

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.045
and it asks me these questions.
I have to find it.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.971
- We'll look for it in the morning.
- I have to find it.

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:54.447
- Help me find my phone!
- I'll help tomorrow.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.246
- I promise you. Tomorrow.
- Help me. No! I want it.

01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.568
- I'll help you find it.
- Help me find it.

01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:04.089
- I promise, but come to bed. Come.
- Help me. God. Help me find my phone.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.920
- Come to bed with me, please.
- All right.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.044
- Please?
- Okay.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.687
Come on.

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.042
Since the beginning,
I completely understand the situation.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.044
Hey.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.803
- Anne?
- I look forward to seeing you guys.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.444
- Hi.
- Hey, Mama. Hey.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.086
It's Anna, Mom.

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.281
I thought you were my sister.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:35.482
- It's okay.
- How are you feeling?

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:38.490
Oh, so uncomfortable.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:41.883
I can't breathe, I can't sleep.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.605
Was it like this for you?

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:45.723
I didn't have two at a time.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.490
This is true.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:50.524
- Did you get the green curry?
- I did. It's right here.

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.484
- Oh, great.
- Everything on track?

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.331
Yes. They made a very generous offer.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.966
- Oh, that's great.
- I guess.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.242
No, it is. It's the right decision.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.643
- Would you like some water?
- Yes.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.684
John, what happened?
Who was on the phone?

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.168
That was that hospital, honey,
the Mayo Clinic.

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.771
Is someone sick?

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.490
No. Nothing's wrong.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.126
Everything's absolutely fine.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.922
Oh, my God.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:23.766
Oh, no.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.208
I was looking for that last night.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:34.129
- That was a month ago.
- Right.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.848
Ali. Hey.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.646
Wake up, baby. It's time to wake up.

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.444
It's time to get dressed.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.529
I'm gonna help you.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.880
I've got some very good news for you.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.331
Let me help you with your pants. Come.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.208
No, I... I want my green one.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.404
Oh, no, I think this one
will be really, really nice.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.568
Let's put that one on.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.290
Okay.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.170
Okay. Lean on me.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.491
Okay, hold on.

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:49.130
Oh, there she is. Hey.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.322
What's the matter? She looks terrible.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:54.046
Well, she just delivered
the babies, honey.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:02.930
- Anna, you had your babies.
- I did, Mom.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.402
- This is Allison.
- You look so beautiful.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.204
- Thank you.
- That's Charlie Jr.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.129
- Little Charlie.
- My goodness.

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:11.924
Yes.

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:18.049
- There you go.
- Can I hold her?

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.283
Is that a good idea?

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:23.481
I know how to hold a baby.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:27.601
That's okay. Mom, you can sit
right there in that chair.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.324
There. That's good.

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:35.729
There we go. All right.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:38.288
Hi.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.491
Something tells me
you've done this before.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:53.010
She looks like you.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.085
There are days she knows
where she is, certainly...

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.130
but there are just as many days
when she doesn't.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.202
Maybe she thinks she's a child
back in New Hampshire or who knows?

01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.688
It's happening more and more.
She doesn't know what's going on.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.530
Yeah, I just...

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.122
I keep thinking about what she said
in that speech, you know...

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:24.243
how important her memories are
to who she is.

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.249
Yes, but that was months ago.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.966
Guys, this is difficult for all of us.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.721
But it's important to remember
who Alice was.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.082
She would not want to be a burden.

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.045
Anna, you have the babies,
you wanna go back to work.

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.449
You're not in a position
to care for her, not seriously, Tom.

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:43.768
And I can't keep Mayo waiting.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.521
The beginning of this month, I am gone.
I want to take her with me.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:52.089
I will get her the best possible care,
and once she's adjusted to Minnesota...

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:56.006
she will be happier for it,
and so will all of us.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.682
- Lydia's gonna flip.
- Oh, so let her.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.969
- Well, she is.
- Well, she has no right to.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.891
If she cared, she wouldn't be
on the other side of the country.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.287
Hot in here.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.722
Who is he exactly?

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.720
His name is Bill Thompson.
He's a manager.

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:25.446
Why is he so important?

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:28.609
He'll open doors for me.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.610
Get me into auditions
I wouldn't be able to get into.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.564
Got me some good headshots.

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.603
I see.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.808
What's his name?

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.044
Bill Thompson.

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.049
He's with Thompson and Gould...

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.527
if you wanna look him up. They're good.

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.882
Kettle's boiling.

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.484
Where's Elena?

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.889
I'm making myself a cup of tea.

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.842
Cool. Where's your caretaker?

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.046
Elena's not here today.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.086
Her daughter's sick.
She's at the doctor.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.804
So you're alone?

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.288
I can make myself a cup of tea.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.450
Okay.

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.370
Okay.

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:24.884
You wanna check out my headshot?
If I send you a link...

01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:28.681
can you open the file,
download the file?

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.009
Yes.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.605
Good.

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:36.244
Okay.

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.809
I'll talk to you later. I love you.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.571
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.201
Hi.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:21.122
Alice, I'm you, and I have something
very important to say to you.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.728
You've reached that point, the point
where you can't answer the questions.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.083
So this is the next logical step.

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.123
I'm sure of it.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:34.967
Because what's happened to you. The...

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.085
You know, the Alzheimer's.
You could see it as tragic, but...

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.802
your life has been anything but tragic.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.083
You have had a remarkable career...

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:47.044
and a great marriage...

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:49.641
and three beautiful children.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.369
All right, listen to me.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.921
This is important.

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.964
Make sure that you're alone
and go to your bedroom.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.403
In your bedroom,
there's a dresser with a blue lamp.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.683
Open the top drawer.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.521
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:14.122
It says, "Take all pills with water."

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:17.204
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle...

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:22.321
but it's very important
that you swallow them all, okay?

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.161
And then lie down...

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.203
and go to sleep.

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.327
And don't tell anyone
what you're doing, okay?

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:06.284
In your bedroom,
there's a dresser with a blue lamp.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.369
Open the top drawer.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.042
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.562
It says, "Take all pills with water."

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.889
Dresser with lamp. Dresser...

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:26.243
Blue lamp. Dresser.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.604
Make sure that you're alone
and go to your bedroom.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.202
In your bedroom,
there's a dresser with a blue lamp.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.323
Open the top drawer.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:51.127
In the back of the drawer,
there's a bottle with pills in it.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.767
It says, "Take all pills with water."

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.606
Now, there are a lot of pills
in that bottle...

01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.971
but it's very important
that you swallow them all, okay?

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.769
And then lie down and go to sleep.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.082
And don't tell anyone
what you're doing, okay?

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.610
Hello?

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:12.723
May I have a cookies-and-cream
and a chocolate hazelnut?

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.531
You know what you want.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.848
Cookies-and-cream
and chocolate hazelnut.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.289
You usually have the original
with blueberries and coconut.

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.527
Okay.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.849
Original with blueberries and coconut,
please.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.565
Ali, you see that building over there?

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.524
Do you know what that is?

01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:42.966
I don't think I know that.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.888
That's Columbia,
where you used to teach.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.242
Someone told me I was a good teacher.

01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:54.171
Yes. You were.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.770
I was really smart.

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:03.004
You were the smartest person
I've ever met.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.723
Ali, do you still wanna be here?

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.204
I'm not done yet.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.731
Do we have to go?

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:23.811
No.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.610
Don't worry.

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:28.643
Take your time.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.810
- Is this all of your stuff?
- I shipped some boxes as well.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.567
Are you sad to leave L.A.?

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:02.724
I'm trying to convince myself
I'm an East Coast girl.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.524
Where's Mom?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.683
She's sleeping.

01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:12.728
Well, here it is.

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.043
Your old room.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.924
So how did it work out
with your manager?

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.521
It's a West Coast company, you know.
Not so good.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.402
Well, that's too bad.
Are you sure you don't mind?

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.367
We've had this conversation.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.610
Okay.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:44.725
It's New York City.
I'll audition, do theater.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.444
I know that this is where I need to be,
though, so...

01:29:49.520 --> 01:29:51.887
You're a better man than I am.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.367
Dad, I've got her, okay?

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:45.247
It's getting pretty cold, huh?

01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:47.769
Wanna head home?

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.283
Come on, let's do it.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.089
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.966
How was your walk?

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.770
I don't think I know you.

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.088
- Yes, you do.
- Hey, Mom, it's Elena.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.203
I'm gonna get you some juice, okay?

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.927
Come, let's take off your coat
and go inside.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:49.001
"Night flight to San Francisco,
chase the moon across America.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.730
God, it's been years
since I was on a plane.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.283
When we hit 35,000 feet,
we'll have reached the tropopause...

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:59.689
the great belt of calm air.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:05.289
As close to the ozone as I'll get,
I... I dreamed we were there.

01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.009
The plane leapt the tropopause...

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:14.088
the safe air, and attained the outer rim,
the ozone, which was ragged and torn...

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:18.330
patches of it threadbare
as old cheesecloth, and that was...

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.889
frightening.

01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.124
But I saw something only I could see...

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.449
because of my astonishing ability
to see such things.

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:31.131
Souls were rising...

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:34.926
from the earth far below,
souls of the dead...

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.566
of people who'd perished...

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.764
from famine, from war,
from the plague...

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:48.249
and they floated up,
like skydivers in reverse...

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.128
limbs all akimbo, wheeling, spinning.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:56.966
The souls of these departed
joined hands, clasped ankles...

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:01.210
and formed a web, a great net of souls.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.605
And the souls were three-atom
oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone...

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:10.850
and the outer rim absorbed them,
and was repaired.

01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:17.445
Because nothing is lost forever.

01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.930
In this world,
there's a kind of painful progress.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.164
A longing for what we've left behind...

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:31.208
and dreaming ahead.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.487
At least I think that's so."

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.570
That's it.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.920
Hey.

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.528
Did you like that?

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:02.088
What I just read, did you like it?

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.450
Yeah.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:12.484
And what...?

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.364
What was it about?

01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.090
Love.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:22.887
Yeah. Love.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:25.684
Yeah, Mom.

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.848
It was about love.
