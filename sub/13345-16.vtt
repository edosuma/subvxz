WEBVTT

00:14.882 --> 00:16.917
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

00:17.017 --> 00:21.222
OH, YOU MADE
BREAKFAST.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.059
YOU ALWAYS DO THAT
IN THESE SITUATIONS?

00:25.159 --> 00:27.795
ACTUALLY THIS DOESN'T
HAPPEN THAT OFTEN.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.240
- YOU SEEM HAPPY.
- ARE YOU FISHING?

00:39.340 --> 00:42.876
DON'T ANALYZE
ME, PAUL.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.579
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.881
I'M HAPPY.

00:47.981 --> 00:50.818
ME TOO.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.654
I THOUGHT
I'D FEEL GUILTY.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.056
BUT YOU DON'T?

00:56.157 --> 00:59.293
IT'S STRANGE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN WITH

00:59.393 --> 01:02.530
OR EVEN LOOKED AT
ANOTHER MAN FOR 15 YEARS.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.799
BUT WE-- I DON'T KNOW,
IT JUST COMPLETELY SEEMED

01:05.899 --> 01:07.401
COMFORTABLE.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.438
COMFORTABLE?
LIKE AN OLD SHOE.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.206
( giggling )

01:12.306 --> 01:15.609
- LIKE A PERFECT FIT.
- OH, OKAY.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.679
LIKE A PARALLEL
UNIVERSE.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.349
I EVEN THOUGHT THAT
IF MARC FOUND OUT,
HE'D UNDERSTAND.

01:21.449 --> 01:24.652
- DO YOU THINK HE WOULD?
- NOPE. NO.

01:24.752 --> 01:28.822
I KNOW HE WOULDN'T.
IT WOULD BE NICE IF HE WOULD,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.458
BUT NO.

01:34.128 --> 01:36.063
BUT THIS ISN'T ABOUT HIM.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.267
THIS IS ABOUT BEFORE HIM.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.403
YOU MEAN YOU THINK I SHOULD
BE GRANDFATHERED IN?

01:42.503 --> 01:44.538
- ( phone ringing )
- EXCUSE ME.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.144
- IT'S MY DAUGHTER.
- OH, I SHOULD GET DRESSED.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.845
- I HAVE A TRAIN TO CATCH.
- OKAY.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.815
HELLO?

01:54.915 --> 01:56.784
OH, HI, ROSIE.

01:56.884 --> 02:00.053
NO NO NO, IT'S NOT A BAD TIME.
CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A SECOND?

02:00.154 --> 02:02.790
DO YOU HAVE TO GO NOW?

02:02.890 --> 02:06.126
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT TAKE
THE TRAIN DOWN TOGETHER.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.764
NO, I MEAN--
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SEES US
ON THE TRAIN TOGETHER?

02:10.864 --> 02:13.267
OKAY.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.869
OKAY.
YEAH, NO NO, I DIDN'T GIVE

02:15.969 --> 02:17.738
UNCLE PATRICK
MY BROOKLYN NUMBER

02:17.838 --> 02:20.341
BECAUSE-- YEAH.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.876
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.146
I-- I, UH, I SHOULD HAVE.

02:29.317 --> 02:32.620
NO, I-I-- I HAVEN'T
SEEN GRANDPA

02:32.720 --> 02:34.655
THIS MONTH,

02:34.755 --> 02:36.590
ROSIE.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.495
LOOK, IF IT WERE
A REAL EMERGENCY

02:41.595 --> 02:44.598
THE NURSING HOME
WOULD CONTACT ME.

02:44.698 --> 02:49.237
BECAUSE I'M
THE EMERGENCY CONTACT,
THAT'S WHY, ROSIE.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.509
I KNOW YOU LOVE
YOUR GRANDFATHER.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.678
AND--

03:02.850 --> 03:05.353
SHE, UH... SHE HUNG UP.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.490
( wry chuckle )

03:11.425 --> 03:14.295
( theme music playing )

03:35.349 --> 03:36.950
- ( panting breath )
- HEY, TAMMY.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.286
HI, PAUL.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.088
I'M SORRY, I'VE--
I'VE GOTTA RUN.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.691
- MARC IS IN THE CAR.
- OH, OKAY.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.127
ARE YOU--
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

03:49.330 --> 03:52.232
NO, I'M-- I'M FINE.
ARE YOU OKAY?

03:52.333 --> 03:54.702
- OH, I'M ALL RIGHT.
- HOW'S YOUR DAD?

03:54.802 --> 03:56.704
HE-HE-- HE'S GREAT.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.973
SO I'LL CALL YOU
LATER ON THEN.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.977
I GOTTA GO.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.628
Gina:
YES, COME IN.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.899
HELLO, PAUL.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.736
HI, GINA.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.606
( sighs )

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.246
THAT'S JUST
WHAT TAMMY ASKED ME.
DO I SEEM--

04:39.347 --> 04:41.682
- YOU SEEM NERVOUS, YES.
- I'M NOT.

04:41.782 --> 04:45.052
MY FATHER'S SICK.

04:45.152 --> 04:48.322
OKAY, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

04:48.422 --> 04:51.892
HE'S PAST SICK.
HE'S GOT LATE-STAGE PARKINSON'S.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.496
- I'M SO SORRY, PAUL.
- THAT'S SO EASY TO SAY,
ISN'T IT?

04:58.366 --> 05:00.901
IT MAY BE EASY TO SAY,
IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.871
OH, FORGET IT.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.543
THANK YOU.
I'M--

05:10.411 --> 05:12.713
I'M SORRY I SNAPPED.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.316
- WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM?
- DOES IT MATTER WHEN I SAW HIM?

05:22.623 --> 05:25.726
( exhales )
I TRY TO TALK TO HIM,
BUT HE'S--

05:25.826 --> 05:27.828
HE'S NOT THERE.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.064
OR-OR-OR-- MAYBE HE IS
AND HE'S JUST CHOOSING TO--

05:31.164 --> 05:33.701
TO HIDE.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.803
REMIND ME AGAIN
WHERE HE LIVES.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.806
HE'S BEEN IN THE SAME NURSING
HOME FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.209
IT'S CALLED VALLEY HAVEN,
BUT IT'S NOT IN A VALLEY

05:42.309 --> 05:44.111
AND IT'S NOT A HAVEN.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.014
IT'S FILLED
WITH DEAD MEN WALKING

05:47.114 --> 05:49.182
AND PISSED OFF NURSES.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.419
- IS HE IN PAIN?
- HE'S IN PAIN,

05:51.519 --> 05:53.721
I'M IN PAIN,
THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD'S
IN PAIN.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.558
LUCKY FOR HIM I'M THERE
TO PAY THE BILL.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.728
LONG AS I DO, HE GETS
TO TAKE HIS NAP TWICE A DAY.

06:00.828 --> 06:03.797
HOW DID WE GET ON TO THIS?
JESUS.

06:03.897 --> 06:07.801
ARE YOU SURPRISED TO FIND
YOURSELF TALKING ABOUT
WHAT A BURDEN HE IS?

06:07.901 --> 06:10.938
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK HE MISHANDLED
HIS FINANCES

06:11.038 --> 06:13.774
DELIBERATELY SO THAT I'D
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.444
HE THREW HIMSELF
AT MY MERCY.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.912
HE'S BEEN SICK
FOR A LONG TIME.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.515
WHY IS HE AT THE FRONT
OF YOUR MIND TODAY?

06:21.615 --> 06:25.352
I DON'T KNOW.
I TALKED TO MY BROTHER PATRICK.

06:25.453 --> 06:28.756
HE SAID MY FATHER
SEEMED A LITTLE BIT...

06:28.856 --> 06:30.558
OFF SOMEHOW.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.160
LIKE PATRICK WOULD
KNOW WHAT THAT WAS.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.496
YOUR BROTHER'S VISITED HIM?

06:35.596 --> 06:38.131
HE GOES OVER THERE
AND HE EATS HIS DINNER--

06:38.231 --> 06:40.000
ACCORDING TO THE NURSES.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.936
CAN'T YOU TELL THEM NOT
TO LET HIM IN AT MEALTIMES?

06:43.036 --> 06:46.039
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHO EATS HIS DINNER.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.676
I JUST--

06:52.913 --> 06:55.616
WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO SAY?

06:56.917 --> 07:00.754
I WAS GOING TO SAY I'M JUST
WAITING FOR THE MAN TO DIE.

07:04.324 --> 07:08.729
YOU ASKED.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.799
IT'S VERY HARD TO HAVE SOMEONE
SICK AND DEPENDENT ON YOU.

07:14.301 --> 07:16.369
IT DRAINS
ALL YOUR RESERVOIRS.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.306
IT MAKES YOU
VERY VERY TIRED.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.543
I MEAN, IT-- IT'S NOT
LIKE HE WAS THIS

07:22.643 --> 07:26.714
GREAT FATHER
WHO GOT PARKINSON'S

07:26.814 --> 07:29.349
AND DISAPPEARED.
HE WAS NEVER

07:29.449 --> 07:31.151
PRESENT IN MY LIFE.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.887
SOMEBODY COULD ALWAYS EAT
HIS DINNER FOR ALL HE CARED.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.790
HE ATE AT THE HOSPITAL, HE SAID.
MY MOTHER STOPPED SETTING

07:36.890 --> 07:38.926
A PLACE FOR HIM AT THE TABLE
WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.394
WERE THERE OTHER THINGS
SHE STOPPED DOING FOR HIM?

07:41.495 --> 07:44.565
I'M SURE THERE WERE,
BUT THE MAN WASN'T THERE.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.767
YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP
CALLING HIM "THE MAN."

07:46.867 --> 07:49.436
DOES THAT HAVE
ANY MEANING FOR YOU?

07:49.537 --> 07:52.439
WHAT, LIKE-- LIKE HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE

07:52.540 --> 07:55.175
"THE MAN" OF THE HOUSE

07:55.275 --> 07:57.144
ONLY I HAD TO DO
THAT JOB FOR HIM?

07:57.244 --> 08:00.213
IS THAT WHAT IT MEANS?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.585
I ASKED TAMMY ABOUT HIM.
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE SAID?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.987
YOU SPOKE TO TAMMY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

08:07.087 --> 08:08.421
- YEAH.
- HMM.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.358
SHE SAID THAT THE FIRST TIME
THAT SHE SAW HIM

08:11.458 --> 08:14.962
SHE THOUGHT HE LOOKED
JUST LIKE "THE MAN"

08:15.062 --> 08:16.429
WAS SUPPOSED TO LOOK.

08:16.530 --> 08:20.233
- SO "THE MAN" CAME FROM TAMMY?
- HER FATHER DIED THAT YEAR.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.572
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE SHE WAS
FANTASIZING ABOUT MY FATHER.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.840
ACTUALLY, I-I--

08:26.940 --> 08:29.643
I'M SURE SHE WAS.
SHE WANTED TO LIVE

08:29.743 --> 08:33.013
IN MY APARTMENT
AND I WANTED TO LIVE IN HERS.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.283
ANYWAY, TAMMY AND I,

08:36.383 --> 08:40.721
WE...

08:42.790 --> 08:44.725
WE WENT OUT FOR COFFEE

08:44.825 --> 08:47.895
AND I DID WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.431
I ASKED HER WHAT SHE REMEMBERED
ABOUT THAT CHRISTMAS EVE,

08:51.531 --> 08:53.701
THE NIGHT THAT MY MOTHER
TRIED TO, UH...

08:53.801 --> 08:58.238
TRIED TO KILL HERSELF.
ANYWAY,

08:58.338 --> 09:01.041
IT TURNS OUT THAT
TAMMY REMEMBERS,

09:01.141 --> 09:03.510
BUT IN A REALLY CRAZY WAY.

09:03.611 --> 09:07.347
A LOT OF IT WAS WHAT
I REMEMBERED, YOU KNOW,
THAT MY MOTHER WAS AT HOME,

09:07.447 --> 09:09.617
THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP,
THAT I WAS AT TAMMY'S,

09:09.717 --> 09:11.585
WE ATE THE COOKIES,
WE WERE SINGING.

09:11.685 --> 09:16.556
AND THEN TAMMY AND I WENT
TO HER ROOM TO TALK,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.827
BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES
I JUMPED OFF THE BED

09:19.927 --> 09:22.062
AND RAN DOWN THE HALL
TO CHECK ON MY MOTHER.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.666
THAT WAS WHERE
YOUR MEMORY WENT BLANK.
WHAT ABOUT HERS?

09:25.766 --> 09:29.670
SHE SAYS
THAT I CAME RIGHT BACK
AND THAT I WAS REALLY UPSET.

09:29.770 --> 09:33.707
THAT MY MOTHER WAS SICK
AND MY FATHER WAS WITH HER,

09:33.807 --> 09:36.209
WAITING FOR AN AMBULANCE.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.578
BY THE TIME TAMMY AND I
WENT BACK, MY FATHER HAD

09:38.679 --> 09:41.148
ALREADY GONE TO THE HOSPITAL
WITH MY MOTHER,

09:41.248 --> 09:45.052
SO TAMMY'S MOTHER BROUGHT
US TO THE HOSPITAL.

09:46.319 --> 09:48.388
SO THAT NIGHT IT TURNS OUT

09:48.488 --> 09:50.357
YOUR FATHER WAS
ACTUALLY WITH HER.

09:50.457 --> 09:54.027
THAT NIGHT HE ACTUALLY
WAS THE MAN.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.428
I, UH, I GUESS.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.031
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE
TAMMY'S VERSION?
- NO, I BELIEVE IT.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.599
WHY WOULD TAMMY LIE?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.769
IT JUST-- IT JUST--

10:01.869 --> 10:04.037
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.940
RIGHT, BECAUSE IF YOUR FATHER
HAD ALREADY LEFT HOME,

10:07.040 --> 10:10.510
HOW COULD HE KNOW
THAT YOUR MOTHER WAS GOING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE?

10:10.610 --> 10:14.882
BUT THAT WAS ALSO
KINDA STRANGE.

10:14.982 --> 10:18.752
TAMMY SAID THAT HE WAS
ALWAYS CALLING HER MOTHER
TO CHECK ON US.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.288
WELL, OF COURSE HE WAS.

10:21.388 --> 10:25.325
IT MUST HAVE BEEN A FUCKING
LOT EASIER THAN COMING OVER
AND SEEING FOR HIMSELF.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.462
OKAY, BUT HE DID
COME OVER THAT NIGHT.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.665
SO, YEAH, HE CALLED
THE AMBULANCE, SO WHAT?

10:31.765 --> 10:35.002
HE HAPPENED TO DROP IN
ONE NIGHT WHEN--

10:35.102 --> 10:38.371
MAYBE HE CAME OVER TO SEE
HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE

10:38.471 --> 10:40.107
BECAUSE IT WAS
CHRISTMAS EVE.

10:40.207 --> 10:42.743
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE IF HE WAS THERE
ONE FUCKING NIGHT?

10:42.843 --> 10:46.479
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER NIGHTS?
THE NIGHTS WHEN HE WAS OFF
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND

10:46.579 --> 10:49.349
WHEN I WAS AT HOME,
GUARDING MY MOTHER?

10:49.449 --> 10:52.686
ALL THOSE OTHER NIGHTS,
WHERE WAS YOUR BROTHER?

10:52.786 --> 10:56.023
- HE'S OLDER THAN YOU.
- YEAH, HE PLAYED--

10:56.123 --> 10:58.258
- HE PLAYED SPORTS.
- WHAT KIND OF SPORTS?

10:58.358 --> 11:01.128
- BASEBALL.
- DID YOU EVER SEE HIM PLAY?

11:01.228 --> 11:04.732
NO, I DIDN'T.
CAN YOU SEE ME TRYING TO DRAG
THIS LONELY, CRYING WOMAN

11:04.832 --> 11:07.500
OUT TO A BALLPARK?

11:07.600 --> 11:12.205
SO YOUR FATHER WAS AT WORK,
YOUR BROTHER WAS AT SPORTS

11:12.305 --> 11:14.241
AND YOU WERE ON DUTY.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.009
AFTER MY FATHER LEFT,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.812
PATRICK DIDN'T EVEN
SLEEP AT HOME VERY MUCH.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.314
- WHERE DID HE GO?
- I DON'T KNOW. FRIENDS,
I SUPPOSED.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.484
- DO YOU REMEMBER
ANY OF THEIR NAMES?
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

11:24.584 --> 11:27.755
I'M WONDERING
IF YOUR BROTHER
WAS ACTUALLY HOME.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.423
COULD YOU HAVE
AIR-BRUSHED HIM OUT TOO?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.393
YOU THINK THAT THEY WERE
BOTH THERE UNDER THE TREE
WRAPPING GIFTS?

11:33.493 --> 11:37.765
OH, PAUL, OUR MEMORIES
CAN BE VERY UNRELIABLE.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.769
WE LIKE TO THINK OF THEM
AS INDELIBLE RECORDS
OF OUR PAST,

11:41.869 --> 11:46.006
BUT EVERY TIME WE
PULL OUT A SCENE,

11:46.106 --> 11:49.442
WE FIDDLE WITH IT
A LITTLE BIT BEFORE
WE PUT IT BACK IN.

11:51.678 --> 11:54.748
YOU KNOW, IF WE HATE
OUR HUSBAND NOW,

11:54.848 --> 11:58.718
WE RE-REMEMBER THE WEDDING
AS LESS JOYOUS,

11:58.819 --> 12:02.790
OR WE SAY, "HE WAS NEVER
THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME
ANYWAY."

12:02.890 --> 12:06.760
WE'RE CONSTANTLY ALTERING
OUR MEMORIES SO THE PAST

12:06.860 --> 12:09.096
WON'T CONFLICT
WITH THE PRESENT.

12:11.832 --> 12:16.203
YEAH, MY MEMORY IS FUCKED.
SO WHAT WAS MY CHILDHOOD
REALLY LIKE, GINA?

12:16.303 --> 12:20.440
NO, PLEASE, I'M NOT
QUESTIONING YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.576
THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE.

12:23.676 --> 12:27.680
I'M JUST WONDERING ON THIS,
YOU KNOW, PARTICULAR NIGHT

12:27.781 --> 12:30.183
THAT MAYBE
SOME OF THE FACTS

12:30.283 --> 12:32.252
AREN'T WHAT YOU
THINK THEY ARE.

12:32.352 --> 12:36.824
GINA, I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE WHOLE NOTION
OF A SCREEN MEMORY, YEAH.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.358
OKAY, OF COURSE YOU ARE.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.161
SO THEN YOU KNOW YOUR
CHRISTMAS EVE MEMORY

12:41.261 --> 12:43.831
TELLS US ABOUT THAT WHOLE
PERIOD OF YOUR CHILDHOOD,

12:43.931 --> 12:45.532
NOT JUST ONE NIGHT.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.370
YOU WERE OVERWHELMED.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.440
YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE
THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW

12:53.540 --> 12:56.209
- HOW MUCH TROUBLE SHE WAS IN.
- MY FATHER KNEW,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.979
- HE JUST DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.414
IF HE CARED, HE WOULD HAVE
PUT HER IN AN INSTITUTION.

13:01.514 --> 13:04.184
HE'D HAVE GOTTEN HER HELP--
WHICH HE FINALLY HAD TO DO

13:04.284 --> 13:07.220
BUT NOT BEFORE I SPENT
EVERY DAY OF HIGH SCHOOL

13:07.320 --> 13:10.323
HAVING NO IDEA OF WHAT I WAS
GOING TO FACE WHEN I CAME HOME.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.792
WOULD ALL THE KNIVES BE
STICKING OUT OF THE WALL?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.427
WOULD THE BATHTUB
BE OVERFLOWING?

13:14.527 --> 13:17.064
WOULD SHE HAVE
AN ELECTRICAL CORD
AROUND HER NECK?

13:17.164 --> 13:19.166
OR WOULD SHE SUDDENLY DECIDE
TO TAKE IT UPON HERSELF

13:19.266 --> 13:21.468
TO CLEAN AND PAINT
THE HALL CLOSETS?

13:25.405 --> 13:28.741
WHY DO YOU THINK HE DIDN'T
INSTITUTIONALIZE HER SOONER?

13:28.842 --> 13:31.011
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE HE NEEDED SOMEBODY

13:31.111 --> 13:33.146
TO TAKE CARE OF THE KIDS.

13:33.246 --> 13:36.283
OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE
YOUR MOM AWAY FROM YOU.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.718
OR YOU AWAY FROM HER.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.787
HOW ABOUT HE AND MY BROTHER
IGNORED HER,

13:40.888 --> 13:42.990
UNTIL SHE FINALLY HAD
TO TRY TO KILL HERSELF

13:43.090 --> 13:44.624
TO GET THEM
TO COME HOME?

13:44.724 --> 13:46.459
YOU KNOW, PAUL,

13:46.559 --> 13:49.129
ONE OF THE CONFUSING THINGS

13:49.229 --> 13:51.631
ABOUT EMOTIONAL INJURY
IN FAMILIES

13:51.731 --> 13:55.068
IS THAT IT CAN FEEL SO UNFAIR,
IT CAN FEEL SO RANDOM.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.137
IT'S LIKE
AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT:

13:57.237 --> 14:01.074
EVERYBODY'S IN THE CAR,
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.277
WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS MY MOTHER
WHO WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

14:04.377 --> 14:07.881
AND YOU TRIED
TO GRAB HER, BUT, PAUL--

14:07.981 --> 14:10.083
COULD YOU LOOK AT ME?

14:13.220 --> 14:17.557
YOU WERE IN THE BACKSEAT.
ALL YOU COULD DO WAS WATCH.

14:19.192 --> 14:23.030
AND MY BROTHER WALKS AWAY
WITHOUT A SCRATCH.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.998
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE SUFFERED.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.599
MY FATHER WAS
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

14:26.699 --> 14:29.069
STRUGGLING TO KEEP OUR LITTLE
FAMILY FROM CRASHING.

14:29.169 --> 14:34.274
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- YES, I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHAT
HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.746
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO NOW

14:39.846 --> 14:41.982
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

14:42.082 --> 14:44.851
YOU KNOW, COMING DOWN TO SEE
THE KIDS EVERY WEEKEND,

14:44.952 --> 14:46.453
CALLING THEM EVERY DAY?

14:46.553 --> 14:51.124
HE WAS NOTHING LIKE ME
AND I AM NOTHING LIKE HIM.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.260
PAUL, YOU'RE WORKING
VERY HARD TO KEEP

14:53.360 --> 14:55.963
FROM TAKING IN ANY GOOD
INFORMATION ABOUT HIM.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.931
TELL ME WHY THE HELL
I WOULD DO THAT?

14:58.031 --> 15:01.168
I MEAN, IF HE WAS HALF-DECENT,
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IT.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.871
HE NEVER DID ONE
FUCKING THING TO HELP.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.208
BUT TAMMY JUST TOLD YOU
A GOOD THING HE DID:

15:08.308 --> 15:10.210
CHECKING UP ON YOU
FROM DOWN THE HALL.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.712
( scoffs )
WHAT DOES TAMMY KNOW?

15:12.812 --> 15:14.781
HE WAS PROBABLY FLIRTING
WITH HER ANYWAY.

15:14.881 --> 15:17.184
YOUR DAD WAS FLIRTING
WITH TAMMY?

15:17.284 --> 15:19.286
HE'S A FUCKING DOCTOR.
THEY'RE ALL FLIRTS.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.888
THE WHOLE TIME I WAS GROWING UP,
HE WAS ALWAYS...

15:21.989 --> 15:23.823
( exhales )

15:23.923 --> 15:26.126
HE WAS
ALWAYS WHAT?

15:26.226 --> 15:28.661
YOU KNOW-- WELL,
IT'S JUST A MEMORY OF MINE,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.363
EXCUSE ME, SO IT
CAN'T BE TRUSTED.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.566
- ARE YOU AFRAID TO SAY IT?
- HE WAS ALWAYS--

15:35.202 --> 15:37.637
- WITH OTHER WOMEN.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.040
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
HOW I KNOW.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.142
I WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.245
MY MOTHER WAS YELLING
AT HIM BECAUSE HE WAS--

15:45.945 --> 15:47.647
SCREWING THIS NURSE

15:47.747 --> 15:51.184
AND SHE WANTED HIM TO LOOK
AT THE EFFECT THAT IT WAS
HAVING ON ME

15:51.284 --> 15:54.054
SO SHE PUSHED ME
AT HIM, HARD,

15:54.154 --> 15:57.057
AND I HIT A TABLE AND I SPLIT
MY FOREHEAD WIDE OPEN

15:57.157 --> 15:59.026
AND HE SEWED ME UP.

15:59.126 --> 16:01.728
SO YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE WASN'T COMPLETELY
USELESS.

16:01.828 --> 16:04.531
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

16:06.433 --> 16:09.269
THESE FIGHTS
ABOUT OTHER WOMEN,

16:09.369 --> 16:11.671
THEY WENT ON
FOR A LONG TIME.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.606
OH, EARLY AND OFTEN.

16:13.706 --> 16:17.177
I THOUGHT
THAT THE FIGHTS BEGAN
AFTER YOUR FATHER LEFT HER.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.748
IT SEEMS THAT THEY WERE HAVING
TROUBLE BEFORE HE LEFT HER,

16:21.848 --> 16:23.383
BEFORE SHE GOT SICK.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.386
MAYBE HIS FUCKING AROUND
MADE HER SICK.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.422
- HIS FUCKING AROUND
MADE HER SICK?
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.691
CHRIST!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO WONDER MY PATIENTS

16:31.791 --> 16:35.128
COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS.
WOULD YOU STOP REPEATING
WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.764
JUST SAY SOMETHING ELSE.

16:37.864 --> 16:42.135
I KNOW IT'S IRRITATING,
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT I UNDERSTAND.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.305
- FINE FINE.
- SO YOU BELIEVE

16:45.405 --> 16:47.874
THAT YOUR FATHER'S
INFIDELITY CAUSED--

16:47.974 --> 16:50.510
DROVE MY MOTHER CRAZY, YES.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.948
WHEN YOUR MOTHER
WAS FINALLY ADMITTED,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.685
WASN'T SHE DIAGNOSED
WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER?

16:58.785 --> 17:02.489
- YES.
- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,
CAN BIPOLAR DISORDER

17:02.589 --> 17:05.725
BE CAUSED
BY THE INFIDELITY
OF A SPOUSE?

17:05.825 --> 17:08.395
NO, GINA, BIPOLAR DISORDER

17:08.495 --> 17:11.731
IS NOT CAUSED BY EVENTS
IN A PATIENT'S LIFE.

17:11.831 --> 17:15.435
EVENTS CAN MAKE
YOU FEEL BIPOLAR.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.371
NO, I KNOW THAT MUCH.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.674
THAT'S HOW I FELT
LAST YEAR WHEN KATE WAS

17:21.774 --> 17:23.443
WITH HER LOVER.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.314
BUT NO, INFIDELITY
CAN'T MAKE YOU BIPOLAR.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.716
YOU EITHER ARE BIPOLAR
OR YOU'RE NOT.

17:29.816 --> 17:33.486
BUT--

17:39.526 --> 17:42.028
IF YOUR WIFE

17:42.129 --> 17:44.631
WAS BIPOLAR, IT--

17:45.832 --> 17:47.700
COULD MAKE YOU

17:47.800 --> 17:49.769
WANT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.709
YEAH, IT COULD.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.146
ESPECIALLY
IF YOU WERE A DOCTOR

17:59.246 --> 18:02.215
AND YOUR WIFE'S MENTAL ILLNESS
MADE YOU FEEL INADEQUATE,

18:02.315 --> 18:06.719
HELPLESS, INCAPABLE
OF HELPING THE PERSON

18:06.819 --> 18:08.655
THAT YOU WERE CLOSEST TO.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.159
AND SINCE HE COULDN'T HEAL HER,
HE LEFT HER FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.395
AND HE LEFT HER WITH ME.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.566
DO YOU THINK I'M
A THERAPIST TODAY

18:19.666 --> 18:22.235
BECAUSE I FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT MY INABILITY

18:22.335 --> 18:24.704
- TO HEAL MY MOTHER?
- NO, I DON'T.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.673
GOOD.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.976
I THINK YOU FELT
YOUR MOTHER'S ILLNESS
DEEPLY.

18:30.076 --> 18:34.514
AND I THINK EVEN AS A CHILD,
YOU HAD AN EMPATHIC RESPONSE
TO SUFFERING.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.318
BUT YOU WERE TOO YOUNG
AND SO YOU WENT TO SCHOOL.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.620
YOU WORKED, YOU STUDIED,
YOU THOUGHT.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.890
AND NOW WHEN PEOPLE COME
TO YOU, YOU CAN HELP THEM.

18:43.990 --> 18:48.195
BUT YOU'RE NOT A THERAPIST
BECAUSE YOU THINK YOU
FAILED YOUR MOTHER.

18:48.295 --> 18:51.564
YOU WERE A BOY, PAUL.
YOU WERE IN THE BACKSEAT.

18:51.664 --> 18:56.403
YOU TRIED TO GRAB HER,
BUT SHE WAS ALREADY GONE.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.640
YEAH.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.577
( softly )
YEAH.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.816
HMPH.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.453
SO I HAVE THIS--
I HAVE THIS-- I HAVE
THIS PATIENT OLIVER.

19:13.553 --> 19:16.456
HE'S A KID WHO'S TRYING
TO SURVIVE HIS PARENTS' DIVORCE.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.328
AND IT'S TAKING
EVERYTHING I HAVE

19:21.428 --> 19:24.264
NOT TO INVITE HIM
TO COME LIVE WITH ME.

19:24.364 --> 19:29.402
I KNOW WHAT HE NEEDS
AND I WANT TO GIVE IT TO HIM.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.605
IT'S THE SAME WITH APRIL
AND HER CANCER.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.110
I JUST WANT TO STOP
THEM ALL GOING THROUGH
THE WINDSHIELD.

19:38.211 --> 19:42.615
DOES OLIVER
REMIND YOU OF YOU?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.719
YEAH, NEITHER OF US--
NEITHER OF US

19:46.819 --> 19:49.289
KNOWS HOW TO BE
AROUND OUR FATHERS.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.659
I MEAN, I HAVE AN IDEA,

19:52.759 --> 19:55.562
BUT IT'S THE SAME IDEA

19:55.662 --> 19:58.565
I'VE HAD SINCE
I WAS OLIVER'S AGE.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.437
I THINK OF MY FATHER
AND HE'S STILL SCREWING
HIS GIRLFRIEND

20:04.537 --> 20:07.474
AND I'M STILL SCARED TO DEATH
THAT MY MOTHER'S GOING TO DIE.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.381
ONLY SHE'S ALREADY DEAD.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.419
AND HE'S ALMOST DEAD.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.890
AND I'M ABOUT TO BECOME
THE ORPHAN I'VE ALWAYS FELT

20:23.990 --> 20:26.493
I WAS FOR 40 YEARS.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.162
I KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO DO WELL BY OLIVER.

20:30.263 --> 20:33.700
HMMM, THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.704
MAYBE THE BOY THAT YOU
REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD TO

20:37.804 --> 20:39.939
IS YOURSELF.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.375
TAKE ME OUT TO A BALLGAME.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.544
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.683
MAYBE WHAT I OUGHT
TO DO FIRST IS...

20:52.084 --> 20:54.521
BE A GOOD SON TO MY FATHER.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.757
- WHAT WOULD THAT ENTAIL?
- I DON'T KNOW, JUST GO
SEE THE MAN.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.728
SEE HOW OFF
HE REALLY IS, MAYBE.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.864
READ HIM THE SPORTS PAGE.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.966
WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN
TO SEE HIM THIS TIME?

21:07.066 --> 21:11.471
BECAUSE I'M BUSY-- I'M SEEING
THE KIDS AND I'VE GOT PATIENTS.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.277
ACTUALLY THE TRUTH IS
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.949
HE STINKS

21:23.049 --> 21:25.452
AND HE LOOKS LIKE HELL.

21:28.855 --> 21:31.391
I'LL PROBABLY LOOK...

21:31.491 --> 21:34.527
LOOK BAD TOO
WHEN I'M ABOUT TO DIE.

21:36.262 --> 21:38.197
I WONDER IF MY KIDS WILL
COME AND SEE ME

21:38.297 --> 21:40.733
WHEN I'M WHERE HE IS.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.973
WHAT IF THEY FEEL ABOUT ME
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT HIM?

21:47.073 --> 21:49.676
- WHAT DO THEY FEEL
ABOUT YOU, PAUL?
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:49.776 --> 21:53.079
THEY'RE SO MAD IT'S HARD
TO TELL HOW THEY FEEL.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.382
THEY'RE MAD AT YOU, PAUL?

21:55.482 --> 21:57.450
THAT'S WHAT THEY FEEL?

22:01.454 --> 22:04.290
AND WHAT IF I'M
JUST LIKE HIM?

22:04.391 --> 22:06.793
I-- I MEAN,
DID-- DID THEY FEEL

22:06.893 --> 22:11.731
THAT THEY HAD
TO COMPETE WITH MY PATIENTS
FOR MY ATTENTION?

22:11.831 --> 22:15.234
HAVE I TOO LEFT MY YOUNG SON
HOME ALONE WITH HIS MOTHER?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.169
WHAT DO THE KIDS
UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHY

22:17.269 --> 22:19.071
YOU AND KATE
ARE DIVORCING?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.374
OH, KATE AND I SET THEM DOWN

22:21.474 --> 22:23.710
AND SAID THE DIVORCE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM.

22:23.810 --> 22:27.213
IT WAS ABOUT A SENTENCE LONGER
THAN WHAT MY MOTHER SAID TO ME,

22:27.313 --> 22:29.849
WHICH WAS, "YOUR FATHER'S
MOVING OUT."

22:31.651 --> 22:34.454
I'M SURE THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT ANY MORE
THAN I DID.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.398
I THINK I HAVE
TO TALK TO THEM,

22:45.498 --> 22:49.702
YOU KNOW,
REALLY TALK TO THEM.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.875
AND I SHOULD...

22:57.777 --> 23:00.112
I SHOULD TALK
TO MY FATHER TOO.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.016
YOU KNOW, JUST--

23:04.116 --> 23:06.085
TALK TO HIM.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.928
OKAY.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.801
SO, UM,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.571
I'VE...

23:25.572 --> 23:27.540
I'VE GOT
MY HOMEWORK TO DO.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.376
AND NEXT WEEK WE'LL
TALK ABOUT TAMMY.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.812
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
TALK ABOUT TAMMY?

23:32.912 --> 23:35.448
GOODBYE, PAUL.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.930
( theme music playing )
