01:47.833 --> 01:48.959
I die

01:49.125 --> 01:50.547
for the Revolution.

01:51.958 --> 01:54.837
No Chinese Woman has yet shed blood
for the Revolution.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.002
I shall be the first,

01:57.500 --> 02:00.344
although the world doesn't know much
about the Revolution.

02:00.833 --> 02:03.211
I leave behind my husband and children.

02:05.833 --> 02:07.301
My death

02:07.875 --> 02:10.502
is my contribution to the Revolution.

02:12.625 --> 02:16.505
It will build an indestructible home
for all people,

02:17.500 --> 02:20.709
a peaceful and calm world for all children.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.713
The long-enslaved masses are numb,

02:28.083 --> 02:31.587
they know not peace, nor calm.

02:41.042 --> 02:42.134
These two children

02:42.625 --> 02:43.421
will soon lose their mother.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.711
I die for all children.

03:00.917 --> 03:03.511
I die for the Revolution.

03:04.458 --> 03:08.133
I'm not afraid, nor do I care about death.

03:08.875 --> 03:12.925
I rejoice at my martyrdom:

03:14.125 --> 03:16.594
At this moment

03:17.208 --> 03:18.926
I cry with blissful tears.

04:18.666 --> 04:20.464
Put the donation boxes in prominent spots.

04:20.625 --> 04:21.672
Go over to the door.

04:21.833 --> 04:22.834
Be vigilant.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.796
Yes.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.630
Let Mr. Sun rest.

04:27.792 --> 04:28.384
Don't disturb him.

04:28.542 --> 04:29.293
Yes.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.385
Juemin.

05:18.792 --> 05:19.384
Who's that?

05:19.792 --> 05:20.258
Who?

05:20.417 --> 05:21.213
Look.

05:22.958 --> 05:24.551
What?

05:30.542 --> 05:34.126
Go, quick.

05:34.708 --> 05:36.085
Get up, there's a woman here.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.251
Don't bother, just go.

06:04.625 --> 06:05.296
Keqiang.

06:05.667 --> 06:06.338
Time to get up.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.092
Get up.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.010
Let me sleep three more minutes.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.126
Alright.

06:10.292 --> 06:11.339
Get up.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.046
Two minutes.

06:14.292 --> 06:15.088
Fine.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.175
Two minutes.

06:39.292 --> 06:40.418
One minutes.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.009
I'll get up.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.593
I should go to Guangzhou for the uprising.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.717
What?

07:08.958 --> 07:10.960
You forgot the committee's
decision last night?

07:11.208 --> 07:12.585
Keqiang, listen.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.467
I won't.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.752
I must throw myself into battle.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.547
Then last night's meeting was a waste.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.260
Why can't we talk it through again?

07:19.417 --> 07:20.669
There's nothing to discuss.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.669
Huang Xing leads the Guangzhou uprising.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.760
Sun Wen handles fundraising overseas.

07:26.042 --> 07:27.385
We voted.

07:27.833 --> 07:28.629
Promise.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.134
Promise.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.631
These are donations from abroad.

07:36.167 --> 07:37.589
Overseas Chinese helped us.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.840
I promised them.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.044
I cannot fail them,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.093
I must carry out my pledge.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.051
It's not a personal promise

07:47.208 --> 07:48.960
but Tongmenghui's promise.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.672
They wrote these letters.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.334
Who's this Woman?

07:59.958 --> 08:01.335
Zonghan.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.009
Xu Zonghan.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.131
Tongmenghui member from my village.

08:06.042 --> 08:06.884
I'm Huang Xing.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.548
Zonghan coordinates underground
organizations in Guangzhou.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.627
You two pretend to be husband and wife.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.176
It's a good cover.

08:16.833 --> 08:18.460
No, it's not appropriate.

08:18.625 --> 08:19.922
Why not?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.676
I'm a woman and I don't care.

08:21.833 --> 08:22.880
What are you afraid of?

08:24.875 --> 08:26.127
It's easy to die in battle,

08:26.417 --> 08:27.589
but hard to motivate the living.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.252
You have the difficult task.

08:31.708 --> 08:37.090
The Guangzhou uprising
will finish off the Qing Dynasty.

08:39.082 --> 08:40.380
Take this pocket watch.

08:42.082 --> 08:43.083
On the day of the uprising,

08:43.582 --> 08:45.176
we'll monitor time together.

09:05.417 --> 09:05.918
Go,

09:06.083 --> 09:06.754
Charge.

09:27.833 --> 09:28.629
Quick.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.172
Quick.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.965
Destroy this wall.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.046
Yes.

10:10.542 --> 10:11.839
You rebel.

10:13.042 --> 10:14.294
You dare revolt.

10:20.208 --> 10:21.585
You revolutionary.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.459
You dare revolt.

10:31.833 --> 10:32.925
You...

10:33.333 --> 10:34.255
You...

10:43.750 --> 10:44.672
Where's Zhang Mingqi?

10:44.917 --> 10:45.543
I don't know.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.217
Quick.

10:51.625 --> 10:52.717
And my Wife.

10:53.333 --> 10:54.380
Quick.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.924
Comrades taking part in the uprising

11:06.083 --> 11:07.335
know me better.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.296
It's easier for me to coordinate...

11:08.458 --> 11:09.630
Nonsense.

11:10.292 --> 11:11.544
I can wield my pen

11:11.708 --> 11:12.504
and scalpel,

11:12.667 --> 11:13.919
why not a gun?

11:14.083 --> 11:16.381
Remember: You're still a wanted man
by the Qing court,

11:16.625 --> 11:17.797
you can't risk it.

11:17.958 --> 11:19.756
If you return to China
to lead the uprising,

11:20.208 --> 11:21.755
you're being irresponsible.

11:31.208 --> 11:31.925
Yu Peilun.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.293
Yu Peilun.

11:34.083 --> 11:35.005
Yu Peilun.

11:35.417 --> 11:36.134
Here.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.505
We couldn't Contact the other groups.

11:40.042 --> 11:41.043
Zhang Mingqi ran away.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.425
Keqiang said,

11:42.750 --> 11:43.922
if the uprising fails,

11:44.458 --> 11:45.550
you must inform Sun Wen immediately.

11:45.708 --> 11:46.425
What else did he say?

11:46.792 --> 11:47.668
He said,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.467
if he's not back by dusk,

11:49.917 --> 11:51.339
you must leave Guangzhou at once.

11:52.792 --> 11:53.543
Quick.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.127
Back off. All of you.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.135
Listen to my command.

12:16.292 --> 12:17.293
Attack from the sides.

12:17.458 --> 12:18.380
- Yes.
- Hand grenades.

12:18.833 --> 12:19.925
- Yes.
- Follow me.

12:25.917 --> 12:27.635
Charge.

12:31.292 --> 12:32.214
Keqiang.

12:35.792 --> 12:36.509
Your hand.

12:36.750 --> 12:37.125
Keqiang.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.835
Don't mind me, charge.

12:39.000 --> 12:39.671
Yes.

12:39.833 --> 12:40.675
Charge.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.051
Get away.

13:49.625 --> 13:50.547
Run.

13:50.708 --> 13:51.709
- What are you doing?
- Run.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.717
Let me go.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.175
Let me go.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.752
Yu Peilun.

14:44.958 --> 14:45.925
Gentlemen,

14:46.583 --> 14:47.835
our fundraiser today

14:48.250 --> 14:50.628
was originally organized
for the Guangzhou uprising.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.714
But just now,

14:54.500 --> 14:55.797
I received news.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.085
Fighting in Guangzhou has ceased.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.965
The uprising has failed.

15:08.625 --> 15:09.592
The telegram states,

15:10.125 --> 15:11.502
the uprising failed,

15:12.750 --> 15:15.173
many of our core members are dead.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.252
You've never met them.

15:19.542 --> 15:24.127
These young people who died were talented,

15:24.750 --> 15:26.343
some came from rich families,

15:27.167 --> 15:28.919
some have just gotten married.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.719
They were willing to sacrifice themselves,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.627
whatever the cost.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.294
They sacrificed their lives for the cause

15:38.542 --> 15:40.044
because they have faith.

15:40.208 --> 15:41.084
What do your lies

15:41.250 --> 15:42.547
have to do with us?

15:42.917 --> 15:43.884
Good question.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.668
Most of you gathered here

15:46.167 --> 15:47.794
are overseas Chinese.

15:48.167 --> 15:49.510
You know Well

15:50.042 --> 15:52.420
our faces mark us as Chinese,

15:53.042 --> 15:55.170
and we've suffered discrimination

15:55.375 --> 15:56.297
and bullying.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.173
We've endured unfair treatment.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.177
All because the country of our people

16:01.667 --> 16:03.089
has long been corrupt

16:03.417 --> 16:04.464
and weak,

16:04.833 --> 16:06.255
writhing in pain.

16:07.042 --> 16:09.841
Our Chinese compatriots

16:10.208 --> 16:11.209
face adversity,

16:11.500 --> 16:12.626
our land taken by others.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.172
Our Revolution

16:15.667 --> 16:17.840
ensures people can pursue happiness,

16:18.167 --> 16:20.044
that our race will regain dignity.

16:21.083 --> 16:24.257
The Chinese revolutionary movement is
blessed by support from overseas Chinese.

16:24.958 --> 16:25.800
For many years,

16:26.208 --> 16:27.710
I strongly believe this.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.052
Overseas Chinese are the
mother of the Revolution.

16:32.708 --> 16:33.675
Gentlemen,

16:36.042 --> 16:37.464
your children

16:42.917 --> 16:44.419
have died for you.

16:45.167 --> 16:46.214
Fang Shengdong.

16:49.292 --> 16:50.464
Lin Shishuang.

16:54.417 --> 16:55.464
Yu Peilun.

16:58.375 --> 16:59.467
Chen Gengxin.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.334
Lin Juemin.

17:06.916 --> 17:09.011
This young man will soon be a father.

17:33.458 --> 17:33.959
What's this?

17:34.208 --> 17:35.505
US $300,000.00

17:36.000 --> 17:37.468
Donation from Zhigongtang

17:39.458 --> 17:40.675
I won't hide this from you.

17:41.167 --> 17:43.795
We sold our ancestral house.

17:48.958 --> 17:49.880
Yat-sen,

17:50.625 --> 17:53.219
we're overseas Chinese,

17:53.958 --> 17:55.960
our roots are in China.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.173
The Qing Dynasty is no longer our home.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.172
Without a place called home,

18:01.792 --> 18:03.214
why Keep an ancestral house?

18:12.542 --> 18:13.418
Take it.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.339
If the Revolution fails,

18:17.875 --> 18:19.718
you'll owe us for generations.

18:41.417 --> 18:42.339
Another one.

19:12.833 --> 19:13.800
Yat-sen,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.092
your pocket Watch

19:16.542 --> 19:17.634
can block bullets,

19:19.542 --> 19:21.044
but not cannon shells.

19:26.083 --> 19:26.754
Fire.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.089
Empress Dowager,

19:56.375 --> 19:57.092
I hear.

19:57.250 --> 19:58.797
Sun Wen has long escaped abroad,

19:58.917 --> 20:00.544
he hasn't returned for more than a decade.

20:00.708 --> 20:01.834
We might want to arrest him,

20:02.083 --> 20:03.835
but it's going to be hard.

20:04.542 --> 20:06.920
Didn't we alert our envoys

20:07.083 --> 20:08.676
and foreign governments

20:08.917 --> 20:10.794
about Sun, telling them

20:10.917 --> 20:12.715
they should monitor his movements?

20:13.042 --> 20:15.511
But Sun gives public lectures everywhere,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.002
raising funds, organizing rebels,

20:18.167 --> 20:19.794
trafficking arms, plotting uprisings.

20:19.958 --> 20:21.676
Minister Xu, perhaps you overstate.

20:22.292 --> 20:24.590
He hasn't appeared before our eyes.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.380
He's only mortal,

20:26.625 --> 20:27.877
not the Monkey King.

20:28.292 --> 20:29.965
What power can he wield?

20:31.625 --> 20:33.878
Sun's done enough to rock the boat.

20:34.250 --> 20:36.799
These years, unrest seethes everywhere,

20:36.958 --> 20:38.835
rebellions follow one after another.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.503
Sun's been misleading others with his lies,

20:41.708 --> 20:44.177
so many follow his path.

20:45.292 --> 20:46.965
What a troublemaker.

20:47.292 --> 20:49.670
As if he doesn't make enough trouble.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.086
The Qing Dynasty will not
fall because of him.

20:52.625 --> 20:53.877
If he dares enter the Forbidden City,

20:54.083 --> 20:55.585
our Manchurian imperial army will kill him.

20:55.875 --> 20:56.467
Yes,

20:56.750 --> 20:57.626
let's just eradicate.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.502
Sun Wen and his cohorts.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.673
We'll destroy them once and for all.

21:01.958 --> 21:03.255
Stop carrying on like this.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.465
No matter whether to kill them,

21:06.625 --> 21:07.842
or praise or punish them,

21:08.708 --> 21:10.881
or whatever other solution,

21:11.083 --> 21:13.085
I only have this to say:

21:13.875 --> 21:15.218
Please, all of you,

21:15.583 --> 21:18.587
let Us have some peace.

21:25.417 --> 21:26.293
Recently,

21:26.667 --> 21:28.510
the mortgage of our railways

21:28.667 --> 21:31.011
against the Four Nations Bank loan

21:31.375 --> 21:32.672
has led to riots.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.506
What's the use of your rifles?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.297
Tell them:

21:37.583 --> 21:38.960
If they revolt,

21:39.875 --> 21:41.377
they'll all die in vain.

21:54.417 --> 21:55.669
Lin Juemin.

21:56.917 --> 21:58.510
You're educated,

21:58.958 --> 22:00.460
you come from a good family.

22:01.625 --> 22:05.334
Why did you join the rebels?

22:08.917 --> 22:09.793
Zhang Mingqi,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.468
why do you hide in darkness?

22:14.375 --> 22:15.547
What are you afraid of?

22:17.417 --> 22:18.418
What am I afraid of?

22:18.708 --> 22:19.800
You're afraid of my youth.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.467
I have chosen death,

22:21.917 --> 22:23.294
but I'm still young.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.130
You might live,

22:26.958 --> 22:28.505
but you are old and worthless.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.089
Have you read the study of evolution?

22:36.792 --> 22:38.089
Survival of the fittest.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.547
Have you considered

22:41.583 --> 22:42.425
the leading nations in the world

22:42.583 --> 22:45.427
were all borne of revolution?

22:46.583 --> 22:47.926
China must also have a revolution.

22:48.083 --> 22:49.050
Affairs of the nation

22:49.917 --> 22:50.634
are not your concern.

22:50.792 --> 22:52.044
Sun Wen said,

22:53.417 --> 22:54.418
China is Weak.

22:55.458 --> 22:57.210
There's no way out.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.669
The royal family, aristocrats and officials

22:58.833 --> 23:00.335
all follow their old ways,

23:00.500 --> 23:01.501
but what of the people?

23:01.708 --> 23:03.381
They barely survive, ignorant of the world.

23:03.542 --> 23:04.634
China is no match for other countries,

23:05.083 --> 23:06.960
it's a dire situation.

23:07.458 --> 23:08.254
Young man,

23:08.667 --> 23:10.544
the Qing court has a hard time too.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.089
The court?

23:13.667 --> 23:15.886
The court gave Hong Kong to England

23:16.292 --> 23:17.714
and Taiwan to Japan.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.084
That's the good Work of the Qing court.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.797
What's the use of keeping it?

23:24.583 --> 23:25.584
I'm interrogating you,

23:25.792 --> 23:27.294
yet you turn around to question me?

23:27.458 --> 23:29.256
You have no grounds to sentence me.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.296
Lin Juemin,

23:35.583 --> 23:37.301
I had wanted to exercise clemency.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.129
There's no need.

23:38.625 --> 23:39.751
My comrades and I fought together,

23:40.958 --> 23:42.050
we'll die together.

23:43.042 --> 23:44.259
I can't be an exception.

23:45.292 --> 23:46.669
When you die,

23:47.500 --> 23:49.468
you'll be left with nothing.

23:49.917 --> 23:51.294
The Qing court wants my life;

23:53.250 --> 23:54.502
I'll destroy the dynasty at its heart.

25:28.875 --> 25:29.876
Hello, Your Royal Highness,

25:30.250 --> 25:32.628
this is a car used by British royalty.

25:33.875 --> 25:37.254
As a member of Chinese royalty, let me try.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.296
Please.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.594
You've come because of
the Sichuan railways?

25:43.417 --> 25:45.761
The loan agreements between our countries

25:46.000 --> 25:49.254
and the mortgage of your railways
cannot be written off.

25:49.417 --> 25:50.839
That's the trouble.

25:51.167 --> 25:52.464
I knew it.

25:52.625 --> 25:55.253
The mortgage of the Sichuan
and Guangdong railways

25:55.458 --> 25:56.630
against your loan

25:56.917 --> 25:58.339
will lead to trouble down the road.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.093
If you forcibly take the railways,

26:00.333 --> 26:01.801
it'll be a catastrophe.

26:02.875 --> 26:06.175
Can't we find a solution, my dear lord?

26:07.458 --> 26:09.085
Look at this invention.

26:09.417 --> 26:10.919
It's an iron machine.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.628
It can move forward and backward,

26:14.292 --> 26:15.965
left and right,

26:16.500 --> 26:17.501
whatever you wish.

26:17.667 --> 26:18.293
My lord,

26:18.500 --> 26:19.717
please enjoy this humble gift

26:19.958 --> 26:22.461
and steer it in the right direction.

26:22.792 --> 26:23.884
Mr. Ambassador,

26:24.750 --> 26:26.002
we've already sent troops from Wuchang

26:26.208 --> 26:29.132
to suppress the Sichuan riots.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.001
Don't you worry.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.090
Your Royal Highness,
you're a great strategist.

26:34.167 --> 26:36.636
You're the one holding the steering wheel.

26:37.375 --> 26:38.843
You have money,

26:39.125 --> 26:40.672
you have navel fleets,

26:41.125 --> 26:44.299
you've always been better
businessmen than us.

26:48.167 --> 26:49.510
In 50 years,

26:50.000 --> 26:51.877
the car you gave me

26:52.125 --> 26:53.968
will be scrap metal,

26:54.250 --> 26:56.503
but my little gift to you

26:56.667 --> 26:58.635
will be priceless.

27:01.542 --> 27:02.213
Thank you.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.126
Open the door. Huang Keqiang.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.752
Quick, open the door. Huang Keqiang

27:10.125 --> 27:11.126
I Know you're inside..

27:12.125 --> 27:12.921
Open,

27:13.167 --> 27:14.009
Huang Keqiang.

27:21.083 --> 27:21.754
Huang Keqiang,

27:22.250 --> 27:23.001
open the door.

27:29.083 --> 27:30.426
Open the door for me.

27:35.042 --> 27:37.261
What are you doing?

27:37.542 --> 27:38.714
Put it down.

27:39.083 --> 27:40.835
Give me the blade.

27:41.000 --> 27:41.546
Let me go.

27:41.708 --> 27:43.255
What are you doing?

27:43.750 --> 27:46.299
What?

27:48.125 --> 27:49.672
You can't die.

27:54.292 --> 27:56.215
I know you saw

27:56.458 --> 27:59.177
all of them being killed.

28:00.167 --> 28:01.009
I know

28:02.833 --> 28:04.301
we failed.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.090
I didn't want to die, Zonghan

28:08.042 --> 28:09.419
I want to keep this hand

28:09.792 --> 28:10.759
to wield the gun.

28:14.583 --> 28:15.584
Help me,

28:16.292 --> 28:17.589
chop it off.

28:18.417 --> 28:19.168
No.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.589
- No.
- So we failed,

28:20.750 --> 28:21.876
we've failed before.

28:22.042 --> 28:22.588
No.

28:41.792 --> 28:42.543
Children,

28:42.792 --> 28:44.635
do you know what the telegram says?

28:44.792 --> 28:45.964
No.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.377
Huang Keqiang is alive.

28:47.750 --> 28:49.002
Fate has been kind.

28:49.167 --> 28:50.589
Who's he?

28:51.792 --> 28:52.793
Huang Keqiang

28:53.292 --> 28:55.044
is a strong and determined man,

28:55.333 --> 28:56.835
a man who won't die.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.923
We don't know him.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.048
But do you know Homer Lea?

29:01.333 --> 29:02.334
Yes.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.467
Take me to him, please.

29:03.875 --> 29:04.626
Yes.

29:06.042 --> 29:06.918
Where's Homer Lea?

29:07.083 --> 29:09.302
There.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.425
Homer Lea.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.835
Homer.

29:15.625 --> 29:16.751
Homer.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.677
- Homer.
- Hey, I'm here.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.338
Mr. Lea,

29:29.625 --> 29:30.171
tell me.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.878
Why are you so interested
in Chinese revolution?

29:33.208 --> 29:34.380
Nowadays,

29:34.667 --> 29:35.668
a Chinese revolution

29:35.833 --> 29:38.052
is the only thing that can
make exciting history.

29:41.333 --> 29:42.380
Exciting?

29:43.042 --> 29:46.546
That's not what our revolution is about.

29:47.500 --> 29:48.672
Why revolution?

29:51.083 --> 29:52.460
I was once a doctor.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.006
I used to save a lot of lives

29:55.500 --> 29:56.592
with my scalpel.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.089
But sadly,

29:59.375 --> 30:00.422
in my country,

30:00.708 --> 30:02.881
life is so miserable

30:03.833 --> 30:05.961
it might be Worse than death.

30:07.417 --> 30:08.634
I always wonder

30:08.875 --> 30:09.967
why my compatriots

30:10.125 --> 30:12.719
have to endure their lives with no dignity.

30:13.042 --> 30:14.885
They survive like animals

30:15.708 --> 30:17.335
with very basic needs,

30:17.708 --> 30:20.962
suffering the oppression
from the ruling class

30:21.333 --> 30:22.835
and foreign powers.

30:24.000 --> 30:24.717
Now,

30:25.542 --> 30:26.714
I cannot accept it,

30:26.958 --> 30:28.460
I will not accept it.

30:28.875 --> 30:30.218
I want to change.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.002
I want a revolution.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.338
Come,

30:37.125 --> 30:38.092
I'll show you.

30:40.583 --> 30:43.006
Recently, in Sichuan,

30:43.417 --> 30:47.092
the central part of China,
people have launched a movement

30:47.250 --> 30:51.926
of protecting railway projects against
the hopelessly corrupt Qing government.

30:52.375 --> 30:59.008
It is said that the Qing government has to
mobilize the army from Hubei province o Sichuan.

31:00.458 --> 31:05.134
What they don't know is many officers
who stayed behind in the army of.

31:05.292 --> 31:08.717
Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu,

31:09.250 --> 31:13.130
are active members of Tongmenghui,
the Restoration League,

31:13.750 --> 31:14.751
I have a feeling

31:15.292 --> 31:17.169
that in the south of Yangtze River,

31:18.042 --> 31:19.760
an even bigger movement

31:20.083 --> 31:21.209
will take hold.

31:21.458 --> 31:23.051
I want to join your revolution.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.005
That's fine.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.835
I would like to invite you

31:27.000 --> 31:30.504
to join the Chinese Revolution
as a military advisor,

31:30.958 --> 31:34.792
but I'm afraid I cannot afford you
and pay the attention that you deserve.

31:34.958 --> 31:35.629
This,

31:36.000 --> 31:37.422
this is not about money.

31:37.583 --> 31:38.880
It's about you, Sun.

31:39.208 --> 31:43.258
You must be China's revolutionary leader.

31:48.792 --> 31:49.759
I promise you.

32:02.792 --> 32:03.918
Peng Chufan.

32:04.458 --> 32:06.802
Liu Fuji. Yang Hongsheng.

32:07.750 --> 32:09.127
The three of them plotted mutiny.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.297
Today punishment is upon them.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.131
We execute them today

32:14.667 --> 32:15.884
as a Warning to all.

32:17.000 --> 32:17.842
Among you...

32:18.000 --> 32:18.592
Governor,

32:18.792 --> 32:20.669
we found the list. What should we do?

32:21.125 --> 32:22.843
What else can we do with

32:23.625 --> 32:24.626
those rebels from the Gongjinhui?

32:25.292 --> 32:26.464
Starting tonight,

32:27.083 --> 32:28.130
kill everyone on the list.

32:28.292 --> 32:29.635
No one will be spared.

32:38.167 --> 32:38.713
All of you,

32:39.667 --> 32:41.385
ask your own conscience.

32:42.500 --> 32:44.002
The Qing court supports

32:44.167 --> 32:45.339
and protects you,

32:45.833 --> 32:46.629
yet you plot to rebel,

32:47.333 --> 32:49.711
following such thugs as Sun Wen.

32:50.333 --> 32:52.176
Isn't that the behavior of unfilial sons,

32:52.708 --> 32:54.676
killing their parents?

33:04.167 --> 33:05.293
Stop, you two.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.677
What are your names?

33:09.833 --> 33:11.130
Xiong Bingkun of the 8th regiment,
8th engineering battalion.

33:11.292 --> 33:12.714
Jin Zheolong of the 8th regiment,
8th engineering battalion.

33:12.875 --> 33:13.592
Lie low.

33:13.750 --> 33:14.672
This is a crisis.

33:14.833 --> 33:15.584
Don't be hot-tempered.

33:15.750 --> 33:16.501
Yes.

33:19.875 --> 33:20.717
What is this?

33:21.958 --> 33:22.880
A mutiny?

33:23.208 --> 33:24.084
Not sleeping?

33:26.292 --> 33:27.214
What do you want?

33:27.375 --> 33:28.297
What?

33:28.583 --> 33:29.209
This is a mutiny.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.217
Tao Qisheng.

33:36.833 --> 33:37.584
Brother,

33:39.083 --> 33:39.925
put down your rifle.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.425
I'm leading a mutiny.

33:42.708 --> 33:44.676
How many more will you kill?

33:45.375 --> 33:46.592
You're lucky that

33:47.083 --> 33:48.380
I'm aiming at you.

33:48.583 --> 33:49.084
Brother,

33:49.417 --> 33:50.885
this is not a joke.

33:51.250 --> 33:52.877
If we don't do it now, then when?

33:53.083 --> 33:53.959
Help.

34:15.625 --> 34:17.172
Tell Zhang Zhenwu to bring
two of his battalions.

34:17.333 --> 34:18.926
Aim all artillery at the
Governor's mansion.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.005
When Xiong Bingkun lights the torch,

34:20.167 --> 34:21.918
fire at the mansion.

34:22.083 --> 34:22.754
Yes.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.676
Charge.

34:34.917 --> 34:35.839
Hand grenades.

34:41.292 --> 34:42.168
Go.

34:55.625 --> 34:56.376
Jin Zhaolong

34:56.958 --> 34:58.460
Jin Zhaolong, Xiong Bingkun.

34:58.667 --> 35:00.169
Lead two platoons.

35:00.333 --> 35:01.630
Order everyone to bring gas canisters.

35:01.792 --> 35:02.839
Rush in to fuel the fire.

35:03.125 --> 35:04.047
Light the target.

35:04.250 --> 35:04.796
Yes.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.501
- Quick.
- Quick.

35:08.167 --> 35:08.918
Quick.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.335
Quick.

35:22.042 --> 35:23.168
Ready,

35:23.458 --> 35:25.005
aiming at the Governor's mansion.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.093
Load.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.010
Done.

35:29.250 --> 35:30.502
Fire.

35:35.958 --> 35:37.210
Load.

35:37.375 --> 35:38.342
Fire.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.380
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.

35:48.542 --> 35:49.418
Good morning.

35:50.083 --> 35:50.629
Here.

35:50.833 --> 35:51.834
Oh, yes.

35:53.375 --> 35:54.501
Oh, Dr. Sun.

35:54.750 --> 35:55.251
Yes?

35:55.500 --> 35:58.583
It seems like there's something
in today's paper about China.

35:58.917 --> 35:59.634
Thank you.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.252
Do you need some help, Dr. Sun?

36:31.625 --> 36:33.252
Can I give you some water?

36:33.375 --> 36:35.252
I'm all right.

36:55.917 --> 36:56.588
Yat-sen.

36:56.958 --> 36:58.710
Hey, what's going on in here?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.009
What are you guys doing?

37:00.167 --> 37:01.669
Come on.

37:01.833 --> 37:04.427
Yat-sen. The Revolution has succeeded.

37:04.792 --> 37:06.294
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- Sorry.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.422
On October 10,

37:09.625 --> 37:10.717
The Revolutionary army took over Wuchang.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.468
Governor Rui Cheng fled overnight.

37:12.750 --> 37:14.923
Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed
the entire country,

37:15.083 --> 37:17.381
asking them to join in the rebellion.
The world's in shock.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.084
Yat-sen,

37:18.417 --> 37:19.339
you should return to China immediately.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.797
I'll reserve a boat ticket for you.

37:20.958 --> 37:23.302
You only need to spend 20 days across
the Pacific, then you'll reach Shanghai.

37:24.667 --> 37:25.714
It happened in Wuchang.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.585
It happened in Wuchang.

37:30.125 --> 37:31.627
Send a telegram to Keqiang in Hong Kong,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.794
so he travels to Wuchang
to lead the revolution.

37:33.958 --> 37:34.550
Yes.

37:37.458 --> 37:37.959
Sun,

37:38.375 --> 37:39.126
I'm ready.

37:39.542 --> 37:40.794
I'll go to China with you.

37:42.750 --> 37:43.626
No.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.710
I'm going to Europe first.

37:46.083 --> 37:48.336
Huang Xing is much better than me
to handle this in China.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.126
Why?

37:49.500 --> 37:50.501
The unrest in China

37:51.875 --> 37:56.005
will be closely linked to the
Four Nations Bank loan to the Qing court.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.590
The court's out of money now,

38:00.750 --> 38:02.127
but if they get the loan,

38:02.458 --> 38:03.710
they can thwart the revolution.

38:05.208 --> 38:06.505
Reserve tickets for Europe.

39:08.542 --> 39:08.963
Zonghan,

39:09.125 --> 39:10.001
don't bother making dinner.

39:10.333 --> 39:11.129
We're running out of time.

39:16.792 --> 39:17.714
Put it down.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.047
Why are you so anxious?

39:23.583 --> 39:24.926
You don't need it.

39:34.917 --> 39:36.919
The battle in Wuchang will be intense.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.085
I'm concerned for your safety.

39:39.250 --> 39:40.923
What about your own safety?

39:42.708 --> 39:43.504
Don't Worry,

39:43.792 --> 39:44.668
I won't die.

39:45.542 --> 39:46.964
Fate will be kind to me.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.130
I should go now.

40:01.250 --> 40:02.092
Go.

40:16.708 --> 40:17.630
What happened?

40:17.792 --> 40:19.794
Only yesterday Rui Cheng reported to us

40:20.042 --> 40:21.919
that the rebel leaders were killed.

40:22.083 --> 40:23.255
A day passed and...

40:23.417 --> 40:24.964
The New Army had it easy.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.296
Clearly,

40:28.542 --> 40:31.512
the Wuchang regiments were sent to Sichuan
to stop the unrest,

40:32.042 --> 40:34.136
so the city was unguarded...

40:34.292 --> 40:36.294
Tell me something I don't already know.

40:36.625 --> 40:38.969
The Qing court has ruled for more than 200 years.
We've ridden through many storms.

40:39.208 --> 40:41.210
It's only a small flame,
we'll extinguish it.

40:43.042 --> 40:43.964
Who should we send

40:44.500 --> 40:46.502
to extinguish this flame?

40:47.833 --> 40:48.504
Empress Dowager,

40:49.125 --> 40:50.217
I humbly believe...

40:53.167 --> 40:55.340
I recommend Yin Chang,
head of the Imperial Army.

40:55.625 --> 40:57.673
This is his duty.

40:59.792 --> 41:00.543
Xu Shichang.

41:00.667 --> 41:01.418
Yes.

41:02.458 --> 41:03.425
Just now,

41:04.000 --> 41:05.092
what were you saying?

41:05.333 --> 41:07.427
Yuan Shikai can fulfill this task.

41:10.667 --> 41:12.169
Better to appoint Yin Chang.

41:12.875 --> 41:14.127
This is family affair.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.835
It's better to send over a Manchu.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.168
Yes.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.217
Empress Dowager,

41:18.542 --> 41:20.169
I would like to submit a request.

41:25.542 --> 41:26.634
Say it, Royal Prince.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.170
Food and supplies precede an army.

41:29.417 --> 41:29.792
There's this old saying...

41:29.958 --> 41:31.756
Be precise,

41:31.917 --> 41:33.715
- don't just quote the classics.
- In my opinion,

41:34.208 --> 41:36.461
We should finalize the loan

41:36.667 --> 41:38.340
from the Four Nations Bank,

41:38.500 --> 41:40.093
we'll have less to worry about later.

41:40.458 --> 41:42.131
Haven't we discussed this for months?

41:42.667 --> 41:43.884
Why hasn't this been done?

41:44.208 --> 41:46.131
The Four Nations Bank felt

41:46.292 --> 41:49.045
we've been indecisive

41:49.292 --> 41:50.714
about mortgaging our railways.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.386
There's been criticism outside.

41:53.750 --> 41:54.751
People say that

41:54.958 --> 41:57.177
we're giving away our sovereignty.

41:58.708 --> 42:00.210
If we're not rulers here,

42:00.375 --> 42:01.592
is this even a country?

42:04.375 --> 42:04.841
General Li,

42:05.000 --> 42:06.968
for the sake of the times, please decide.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.051
I've treated you well.

42:09.417 --> 42:11.090
Why are you making it so difficult for me?

42:11.667 --> 42:12.964
We ask that you lead the
Military Government.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.502
We're not making it difficult.

42:15.042 --> 42:16.043
Drop your gun.

42:17.667 --> 42:18.714
Please ask him to drop his gun.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.543
Put it down.

42:29.542 --> 42:30.259
General Li,

42:31.208 --> 42:32.881
you've treated us well.

42:33.625 --> 42:36.094
We wish you'd lead the Military Government.

42:36.292 --> 42:37.919
You nave great talents
among the revolutionary ranks.

42:38.125 --> 42:39.342
Why don't you ask Sun
Wen to be your leader?

42:39.500 --> 42:40.342
Li Yuanhong.

42:40.917 --> 42:43.261
The revolutionary party
will select our leaders.

42:44.000 --> 42:44.717
At present.

42:44.875 --> 42:45.751
Sun Wen is still abroad,

42:46.208 --> 42:47.255
and Huang Keqiang is on his Way here.

42:47.500 --> 42:48.752
That's why we offer you this.

42:49.250 --> 42:49.796
Li Yuanhong,

42:50.083 --> 42:50.925
do you understand your predicament?

42:51.083 --> 42:52.505
I can give up my position
in the Qing court,

42:52.875 --> 42:54.798
but I don't want to become
a revolutionary official.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.084
I only want to return home.

42:58.208 --> 42:59.881
You have no idea of the real situation:

43:00.458 --> 43:02.256
Although Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao
have gone into hiding,

43:02.625 --> 43:04.502
if the court's troops
were to counterattack,

43:04.792 --> 43:07.671
they can destroy Wuchang in a second.

43:16.417 --> 43:16.792
Come back.

43:16.958 --> 43:17.800
Stop.

43:18.167 --> 43:19.464
- Come back.
- Go.

43:19.667 --> 43:20.293
Stop.

43:22.125 --> 43:22.967
Go.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.675
Lie down.

43:34.792 --> 43:36.465
Yin Chang's firing at us
from a German battleship.

43:36.667 --> 43:37.168
General Li,

43:37.333 --> 43:38.129
are you all right?

43:38.333 --> 43:39.676
What damned battle is this?

43:40.083 --> 43:41.926
I'll die because of you.

43:42.083 --> 43:43.505
Remove the ammunition, quick.

43:43.667 --> 43:44.839
We'll die together.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.593
We'll count you as a revolutionary martyr.

43:48.167 --> 43:50.340
Li Yuanhong, General of the Mixed Brigade.

43:50.875 --> 43:53.003
I'm Military Governor Li Yuanhong.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.300
If you Want to live,

43:54.458 --> 43:56.176
return to your stations.

43:59.500 --> 44:00.877
Attention.

44:01.042 --> 44:01.918
Yes.

44:02.167 --> 44:05.501
Target: Battleship "Chuyu"

44:05.708 --> 44:09.508
Distance: 2400 feet.

44:09.750 --> 44:12.833
Load.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.843
Prepare for rapid firing, first round.

44:15.167 --> 44:17.841
Rapid firing, first round.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.718
Fire.

44:23.375 --> 44:24.297
Distance:

44:24.542 --> 44:26.169
2350 miles,

44:26.458 --> 44:27.755
25m to the right.

44:27.917 --> 44:29.043
Load.

44:29.208 --> 44:30.585
Fire all three cannons.

44:30.750 --> 44:31.967
Fire.

44:39.042 --> 44:40.419
Cease fire.

44:41.542 --> 44:42.589
Why did we stop?

44:43.167 --> 44:44.419
I'm the Military Governor,

44:44.750 --> 44:46.377
I make all the decisions.

44:46.667 --> 44:47.634
Why did they stop?

44:49.833 --> 44:50.755
They ran out of ammunition?

44:50.917 --> 44:51.543
Doesn't look like it.

44:52.208 --> 44:54.006
Should we fire back to test them?

44:54.208 --> 44:55.084
What for?

44:55.500 --> 44:57.002
Better keep our lives. Run.

44:57.167 --> 44:58.043
Run.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.128
Even if we annihilate Yin Chang,

45:04.542 --> 45:05.714
so what?

45:06.833 --> 45:07.880
He's of no consequence.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.090
The real battle is ahead of us.

45:10.792 --> 45:11.588
Yes.

45:12.417 --> 45:13.464
You want to cut my queue?

45:14.000 --> 45:14.421
Fine.

45:14.792 --> 45:15.463
Come.

45:21.792 --> 45:24.090
Since you revolutionaries
have bestowed such honour on me,

45:24.625 --> 45:26.593
I'll be presumptuous and break the law.

45:38.917 --> 45:40.419
Father.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.009
Good news.

45:47.375 --> 45:49.048
You scared away my fish.

45:51.958 --> 45:53.460
You're coming out of seclusion.

45:58.375 --> 45:59.968
You can't hold your horses, can you?

46:23.250 --> 46:24.672
General, Huafu is here.

46:27.292 --> 46:28.293
Huafu.

46:28.958 --> 46:30.005
Let's show

46:30.333 --> 46:33.382
the revolutionaries and
those in the Forbidden City

46:33.875 --> 46:35.343
our great Beiyang Army

46:36.500 --> 46:37.672
and our great power.

46:37.875 --> 46:38.376
Yes.

46:38.750 --> 46:40.343
Attention, artillery.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.218
Target ahead,

46:42.542 --> 46:44.260
25m to the right,

46:44.500 --> 46:45.717
distance at 500.

46:45.958 --> 46:47.335
Load.

46:47.500 --> 46:48.922
Ready.

46:51.625 --> 46:52.171
Fire.

47:21.375 --> 47:22.217
Alcohol.

48:09.583 --> 48:10.334
Keqiang.

48:10.500 --> 48:11.877
Where should We go?

48:13.708 --> 48:15.551
Wherever there's heavy gunfire.

48:17.583 --> 48:18.425
Make way.

48:19.125 --> 48:19.796
Make way.

48:25.333 --> 48:26.084
Commander.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.047
Avoid gunfire.

48:40.458 --> 48:41.630
Avoid gunfire.

48:41.792 --> 48:43.169
Hide in the trench with your squad.

48:43.417 --> 48:44.259
Hide in the trench.

48:49.500 --> 48:50.672
Hide in the trench.

48:56.292 --> 48:58.340
Don't run.

49:01.833 --> 49:03.210
Go back.

49:08.000 --> 49:08.592
Don't run.

49:08.750 --> 49:10.127
Retrieve the gun.

49:13.625 --> 49:14.296
Remember,

49:15.083 --> 49:16.881
alive soldier is useless

49:17.042 --> 49:19.545
without his weapon.

49:22.125 --> 49:22.921
Tell me, Huafu.

49:23.250 --> 49:23.967
Tell me.

49:25.333 --> 49:26.175
General,

49:28.958 --> 49:29.675
We've taken.

49:30.167 --> 49:31.134
Hankou.

49:31.500 --> 49:34.299
Your order to Scorch

49:34.458 --> 49:35.129
we attack Wuchang right away.

49:35.292 --> 49:36.509
Now gives us access to Wu...

49:38.500 --> 49:40.548
What's your next step?

49:41.208 --> 49:41.879
Morale is high,

49:42.042 --> 49:43.544
we attack Wuchang right away.

49:43.958 --> 49:44.629
Great.

49:45.125 --> 49:46.342
We take Hankou first,

49:46.583 --> 49:47.675
then attack Beijing.

49:47.833 --> 49:48.800
We'll conquer the world.

49:48.958 --> 49:50.005
Sit down, have some food.

49:50.167 --> 49:51.043
This is a Heaven-sent opportunity.

49:51.208 --> 49:52.334
Sit down.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.217
Keding,

50:21.042 --> 50:22.715
you're cutting to the quick.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.001
Let's wait on.

50:27.375 --> 50:28.843
Wuchang.

50:29.875 --> 50:31.593
After the rabbit is killed,

50:32.083 --> 50:33.380
the hunting dog will be cooked.

50:40.917 --> 50:42.510
Enemy positions nave advanced.

50:42.875 --> 50:44.001
Once they cover their firing range,

50:44.167 --> 50:45.214
the infantry will attack.

50:45.542 --> 50:47.590
The key to combat is to avoid gunfire.

50:47.750 --> 50:48.421
Yes.

50:50.042 --> 50:50.668
Idiot,

50:50.875 --> 50:52.092
trying to run away? I'll kill you.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.172
Drop your gun.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.465
He's Huang Xing, our Commander.

50:57.875 --> 50:58.546
Salute.

50:59.083 --> 50:59.959
I command you all:

51:00.208 --> 51:00.879
From now on,

51:01.042 --> 51:01.634
follow my orders.

51:01.792 --> 51:02.384
Yes.

51:05.667 --> 51:07.465
Always be prepared to enter the frontlines.

51:07.583 --> 51:08.209
Yes.

51:14.375 --> 51:16.093
We torched Hankou well,

51:16.250 --> 51:17.752
it was a great offense.

51:19.250 --> 51:20.627
But now,

51:21.208 --> 51:22.630
we won't follow up.

51:29.750 --> 51:31.673
If the revolutionaries
can be easily defeated,

51:31.917 --> 51:33.760
the country still belongs
to the Qing court.

51:34.083 --> 51:35.551
If the Qing court is also weak,

51:35.708 --> 51:37.756
the revolutionaries could seize power.

51:37.917 --> 51:39.294
Somehow,

51:41.042 --> 51:43.215
we must be get a share of it.

51:44.708 --> 51:46.756
Here's my condition:

51:46.917 --> 51:49.295
I take full power over the
army and its supplies.

51:49.708 --> 51:50.550
Now.

51:51.667 --> 51:54.511
Empress Dowager Longyu
and the princes must Know that

51:55.417 --> 51:57.795
they either get the loan
from the Four Nations Bank,

51:57.958 --> 52:00.381
or there'll be no more battle.

52:03.958 --> 52:05.835
Regarding the revolutionaries...

52:06.250 --> 52:07.968
Should we Contact Li Yuanhong
and test the waters?

52:08.292 --> 52:09.544
He's not a revolutionary.

52:12.625 --> 52:14.218
In the long run,

52:14.708 --> 52:17.962
we should find someone we can connect with.

52:18.250 --> 52:19.923
Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing.

52:20.500 --> 52:21.001
Reporting to the General.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.550
Wang Jingwei is here.

52:29.167 --> 52:30.043
Please.

52:31.500 --> 52:32.376
Isn't Wang

52:32.667 --> 52:34.544
supposed to be in Beijing, in prison?

52:35.250 --> 52:37.423
Zaifeng released him.

52:38.958 --> 52:39.834
You were locked up for a year.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.843
You've suffered.

52:43.667 --> 52:45.135
Times have changed, don't
mention it any more.

52:45.792 --> 52:48.841
I treasure you most among
the revolutionaries.

52:49.625 --> 52:51.093
I was just telling Keding,

52:51.875 --> 52:54.253
we should swear as blood brothers.

52:55.667 --> 52:56.714
Zhaoming,

52:57.542 --> 52:58.543
tell me.

52:58.958 --> 53:01.928
What do the revolutionaries want?

53:02.458 --> 53:03.960
We Want to establish a republic.

53:05.000 --> 53:05.796
Republic?

53:07.875 --> 53:10.003
But Why?

53:10.333 --> 53:11.505
Feudalism has kept China

53:11.792 --> 53:13.385
back for far too long.

53:13.583 --> 53:14.425
As long as there's an Emperor,

53:14.583 --> 53:16.585
we cannot rid ourselves of the old system.

53:16.750 --> 53:17.501
The Revolution must

53:17.833 --> 53:19.085
depose the Emperor

53:19.417 --> 53:20.543
and the imperial system.

53:20.708 --> 53:21.960
That's all theory.

53:22.125 --> 53:23.547
We have to put it in practice.

53:23.792 --> 53:25.385
When the Republic is established,

53:26.125 --> 53:27.593
who will lead it?

53:28.167 --> 53:29.714
A leader of the Republic
is elected by all citizens.

53:38.083 --> 53:38.879
Zhaoming.

53:39.708 --> 53:41.301
The General pondered seriously

53:41.458 --> 53:42.710
before inviting you from Beijing.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.422
He'd like your help.

53:45.333 --> 53:46.755
You're the one who knows

53:47.042 --> 53:48.043
the revolutionaries well.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.672
Zhaoming

53:50.125 --> 53:53.174
Is Sun Wen still abroad?

54:17.917 --> 54:18.634
Gentlemen.

54:19.000 --> 54:19.876
Gentlemen,

54:20.250 --> 54:21.251
you know who I am

54:21.458 --> 54:22.334
and Why I'm here.

54:22.500 --> 54:23.547
It seems to me

54:23.750 --> 54:25.878
that you have decided that
you're against the revolution.

54:26.083 --> 54:27.335
Am I right?

54:29.708 --> 54:30.425
Go.

54:35.750 --> 54:36.751
If that's the case,

54:36.958 --> 54:39.131
the Qing government will take this loan,

54:39.792 --> 54:41.294
buy guns and shoot through

54:41.458 --> 54:43.005
the hearts of revolutionaries.

54:43.250 --> 54:45.878
Your money will support
the corrupt Qing government,

54:46.083 --> 54:47.551
in exchange for What?

54:47.833 --> 54:48.675
Railway?

54:49.000 --> 54:49.967
Our railway.

54:50.125 --> 54:50.796
Sir.

54:51.333 --> 54:51.754
Sir,

54:51.917 --> 54:53.794
please keep your voice down.

54:54.208 --> 54:56.586
You're deciding the future
of my country here.

54:57.083 --> 54:57.959
Being a Chinese,

54:58.125 --> 54:59.877
I have the right to know
what's going on here.

55:00.292 --> 55:02.420
We've already informed your government

55:02.583 --> 55:04.210
regarding our decision.

55:04.500 --> 55:07.049
You must tell me your decision.

55:07.833 --> 55:09.927
Let me remind you that we're in Europe.

55:10.167 --> 55:13.876
You really should behave like a gentleman.

55:14.042 --> 55:15.965
Do you understand what's
happening in China now?

55:16.208 --> 55:17.175
Mr. Sun Wen.

55:19.292 --> 55:20.544
He won't answer.

55:20.875 --> 55:22.001
They are bankers,

55:22.500 --> 55:23.922
they only care about their money,

55:24.208 --> 55:25.676
not other people's fate.

55:26.083 --> 55:27.130
Mr. Hillier,

55:28.500 --> 55:29.843
do you know who he is?

55:30.167 --> 55:30.793
No.

55:31.167 --> 55:33.966
He's the man who will
decide the future of China.

55:39.375 --> 55:40.171
Who are you?

55:40.458 --> 55:41.175
Tang Manrou.

55:41.333 --> 55:42.175
Idiot.

55:42.333 --> 55:44.051
Your father is the Chinese
Imperial Ambassador,

55:44.208 --> 55:45.835
and you spoke for Sun Wen?

55:46.708 --> 55:48.335
Do you know who he is?

55:49.625 --> 55:50.717
Who is he?

55:51.333 --> 55:53.677
He's a traitor of the Qing Dynasty.

55:54.125 --> 55:56.298
He's a wanted criminal.

55:59.292 --> 56:00.760
He's a revolutionary.

56:01.583 --> 56:02.709
Don't you know?

56:04.542 --> 56:05.634
Tang Manrou.

56:07.125 --> 56:08.798
I know who he is,

56:10.500 --> 56:12.252
that's why I helped him.

56:27.625 --> 56:28.751
Mr. Hillier.

56:29.708 --> 56:30.755
Hillier.

56:31.625 --> 56:33.002
I must go before this person arrives.

56:33.625 --> 56:35.047
We cannot be present in the same place.

56:35.542 --> 56:36.885
Why leave, Minister Tang?

56:37.083 --> 56:39.302
I beg you, you still haven't done us

56:39.458 --> 56:41.506
the honour of accepting our invitation.

56:41.833 --> 56:43.881
You really mustn't leave.

56:44.667 --> 56:47.591
Please. Don't leave.

56:48.917 --> 56:50.089
Ladies and Gentlemen:

56:50.333 --> 56:53.052
I'm well aware that I've
come here uninvited.

56:53.708 --> 56:54.425
However,

56:54.917 --> 56:58.000
as the leader of the Chinese revolution,
I only ask you,

56:58.375 --> 57:00.423
please reconsider the 6 million pounds,

57:00.583 --> 57:02.176
your loan to the Qing government.

57:02.333 --> 57:03.129
Sun Wen,

57:03.542 --> 57:04.919
you're a subject of the Qing Dynasty,

57:05.500 --> 57:06.922
yet you show no respect for your country.

57:07.083 --> 57:09.802
How can you claim
any respect regarding our country?

57:10.083 --> 57:13.007
You've lost it all a long time ago.

57:14.375 --> 57:16.548
I represent the Whole Chinese people,

57:17.083 --> 57:20.053
and speak in the name
as leader of the Chinese revolution.

57:20.208 --> 57:20.925
Dr. Sun,

57:21.083 --> 57:21.675
we will not break

57:21.833 --> 57:23.631
such an important business contract.

57:23.792 --> 57:24.588
Mr. Thompson,

57:24.750 --> 57:26.297
this is not a business contract,

57:26.750 --> 57:28.172
it's a political deal.

57:29.042 --> 57:31.636
If this contract is signed,
what's at stake here

57:31.833 --> 57:33.301
is Chinese sovereignty.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.126
Mr. Sun,

57:34.292 --> 57:36.886
our German banks only care about business,

57:37.208 --> 57:40.087
we don't care about domestic politics.

57:40.250 --> 57:42.173
My dearest German delegates,

57:42.833 --> 57:46.133
every time the Qing
government fires a gun at us,

57:46.667 --> 57:48.340
your money presses the trigger.

57:48.583 --> 57:51.917
The Qing government will buy weapons
with your loan, nothing else.

57:52.083 --> 57:53.551
Perhaps you've misunderstood.

57:53.708 --> 57:56.917
According to my understanding, this loan
is intended to help rebuild the railways.

57:57.458 --> 57:58.300
Mr. Sun,

57:58.542 --> 57:59.964
our minister in Peking,

58:00.125 --> 58:01.297
Sir John Newell Jordan,

58:01.458 --> 58:02.801
said the same thing about the loan.

58:02.958 --> 58:04.005
Dear Sir Buchanan,

58:04.167 --> 58:06.761
I believe when Mr. Jordan realizes

58:07.375 --> 58:10.504
that the money is used to destroy
the Chinese revolution,

58:10.792 --> 58:11.918
he will change his mind.

58:12.333 --> 58:12.959
Sun Wen.

58:13.208 --> 58:14.380
This is my second warning.

58:14.875 --> 58:16.172
Do not defame the Qing Dynasty here.

58:16.333 --> 58:17.334
Defame?

58:18.250 --> 58:19.046
Minister Tang,

58:19.292 --> 58:20.635
how you underestimated us.

58:21.125 --> 58:23.127
We Want to depose you and the court.

58:24.000 --> 58:24.671
Gentlemen,

58:24.958 --> 58:26.801
we all know that to give good money

58:27.042 --> 58:28.294
to a bad client

58:28.458 --> 58:29.755
is a fatal mistake.

58:30.333 --> 58:33.257
The Qing government
is like a patient diagnosed with cancer.

58:33.458 --> 58:35.426
Your loan is like sugar pills,

58:35.583 --> 58:37.301
it'll only make him feel better,

58:37.500 --> 58:39.343
but the fate is sealed.

58:39.708 --> 58:42.882
It seems that you are quite pessimistic
about the future in China.

58:43.125 --> 58:44.547
No, I'm not.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.047
On the contrary,

58:46.208 --> 58:47.551
my vision of the new China

58:47.708 --> 58:48.504
is very positive.

58:48.833 --> 58:52.042
I see huge miles covered
with natural resources.

58:52.333 --> 58:54.711
I see thousands of banks
providing new capital.

58:54.917 --> 58:58.547
I see a mountain of railways connecting
all the modern communities.

58:59.208 --> 59:00.050
Gentlemen,

59:00.792 --> 59:02.214
you are bankers,

59:02.792 --> 59:05.136
you should know to invest
your money wisely.

59:05.375 --> 59:07.798
Would you rather invest your money

59:08.042 --> 59:11.546
into a dying government
or the emerging one?

59:11.792 --> 59:13.135
Mr. Sun Yat-sen,

59:13.458 --> 59:15.711
I know you are the leader
of this revolution,

59:15.875 --> 59:17.548
and I respect your revolution.

59:17.708 --> 59:21.793
However, we cannot invest money
against the interests of our own nation.

59:22.292 --> 59:23.088
You may know that

59:23.250 --> 59:24.217
I'm a surgeon.

59:24.542 --> 59:26.761
As a doctor, my duty

59:27.083 --> 59:28.926
is to save my patient's life.

59:29.333 --> 59:30.255
One day

59:30.667 --> 59:32.044
I found my country

59:32.375 --> 59:33.797
is suffering cancer.

59:34.958 --> 59:35.880
Mr. Hillier,

59:36.458 --> 59:38.085
The situation of China

59:38.417 --> 59:40.670
is like this roast lamb,

59:41.958 --> 59:43.585
it's unlikely our people

59:44.333 --> 59:45.676
would enjoy freedom,

59:45.958 --> 59:46.959
equality

59:48.208 --> 59:49.425
and fraternity.

59:50.125 --> 59:50.796
Yes,

59:51.375 --> 59:52.422
that is to say,

59:52.667 --> 59:54.214
this is China.

59:54.667 --> 59:56.761
And all of you Want a piece.

59:57.500 --> 59:58.092
Germany

59:58.375 --> 59:59.376
here's your piece,

59:59.583 --> 01:00:01.756
the Shandong peninsula.

01:00:05.917 --> 01:00:07.419
Good location, isn't it?

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.548
What's all this?

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:10.630
Sir Buchanan,

01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:11.714
your piece,

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:14.344
left rather small on this plate:

01:00:14.792 --> 01:00:16.009
Only Hong Kong,

01:00:16.292 --> 01:00:17.464
and you know very well,

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.751
this is a gate

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:20.760
to reach China.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.799
Mr. Thompson, let me out out
a special piece for you,

01:00:25.042 --> 01:00:27.465
in memory of all those Chinese lives

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:32.923
that were lost carving out your mountain
for the transcontinental railway

01:00:34.583 --> 01:00:38.884
where they sleep, buried,
the bones of Chinese labourers.

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:39.842
It's a pity,

01:00:40.292 --> 01:00:42.920
all those countries not here today:

01:00:43.375 --> 01:00:44.001
Russia,

01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:45.919
Japan and Portugal.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:48.302
They want Pescadores, Liaodong Peninsula

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:49.459
and Macau.

01:00:51.042 --> 01:00:51.668
Gentlemen,

01:00:52.333 --> 01:00:53.004
this

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:56.671
is the last time you can
gather to feast on China.

01:00:57.417 --> 01:00:58.384
I really hope

01:00:58.542 --> 01:00:59.964
I made my point clear.

01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:02.963
Mr. Tang,

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:04.718
please wait a moment. Please.

01:01:05.458 --> 01:01:06.334
Go home.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:08.209
Please.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:10.002
Please stay.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:11.217
Stay.

01:01:20.417 --> 01:01:20.963
Here it is.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:24.673
Please tell me, what does Revolution mean?

01:01:25.292 --> 01:01:26.384
Like a doctor who heals patients,

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:28.377
a revolution saves an entire people.

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:31.009
Mr. Sun,

01:01:31.167 --> 01:01:32.760
I heard girls in China

01:01:32.917 --> 01:01:34.715
have to bound their feet from young age.

01:01:34.917 --> 01:01:36.009
Is it painful?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:38.798
Yes, it's painful

01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:40.134
but

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.964
it will be gone very soon.

01:01:43.042 --> 01:01:44.794
I see. Thank you.

01:01:47.333 --> 01:01:48.004
Must people

01:01:48.167 --> 01:01:49.384
lose their lives in revolution?

01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:51.176
The final goal of revolution isn't death,

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:53.343
but to change fate.

01:01:53.958 --> 01:01:56.427
Young people sacrificed themselves
for the revolution,

01:01:56.792 --> 01:01:59.591
so those living can lead better lives.

01:04:40.583 --> 01:04:41.755
Extend firing range.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:46.922
Come.

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.794
It's overheated. It won't fire.

01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:51.043
Go, piss.

01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:20.419
Lie down.

01:05:21.625 --> 01:05:22.751
Lie down.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.510
Nurse.

01:05:35.917 --> 01:05:36.509
Little Hubei,

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:37.634
gather hand grenades.

01:05:43.875 --> 01:05:44.546
Give them to me.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.967
- Give them to me.
- No.

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:47.009
Let go.

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:49.044
- Commander.
- Let go.

01:05:49.208 --> 01:05:50.004
Don't pull me back.

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:51.634
Don't pull me back.

01:05:52.458 --> 01:05:54.085
Let go.

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:56.543
Go.

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:57.964
Little Hubei.

01:06:03.833 --> 01:06:04.755
Ammunition handler.

01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:12.636
Charge.

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:14.175
General,

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:15.547
Huafu is here.

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:18.259
General,

01:07:18.708 --> 01:07:19.925
We've taken Hanyang.

01:07:20.167 --> 01:07:22.420
Should we continue fighting?

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:24.714
There's

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.048
no need to be in such a rush.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.718
We nave to let the Qing court understand,

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:30.551
if they don't pay up,

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.965
we won't move.

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:38.834
Your words mean...

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:40.380
Can't you read?

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:41.592
Read it yourself.

01:07:42.375 --> 01:07:43.672
Fight slowly,

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:45.210
wait and see?

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:49.465
- But morale is high.
- I must return to Beijing

01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:51.761
and see what the Empress Dowager says.

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:55.676
Let me tell you my bottom line:

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.254
If the court

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.844
doesn't give me enough money,

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:02.256
I won't fight.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:06.007
I'd thought it'd be easy to defeat them,

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.551
but Sun's rebels

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.669
are resilient.

01:08:11.417 --> 01:08:15.126
I also lack ammunition and supplies.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.042
Empress Dowager,

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:19.590
I was forced to cease

01:08:19.875 --> 01:08:21.468
the battle of Wuchang.

01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:22.501
Yuan Shikai.

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:23.589
Yes, Empress Dowager.

01:08:24.875 --> 01:08:26.046
How much do you need?

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:28.796
Tell me.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.924
If I have12 million taels of gold,

01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:39.050
I can finish off the revolutionaries

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:41.381
within a few months.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.126
If we have no money for battle,

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.256
we only have one choice:

01:08:46.707 --> 01:08:48.836
To make peace with the revolutionaries.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.046
You dare?

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.423
Making peace means we acknowledge them.

01:08:54.042 --> 01:08:55.419
The Beiyang Army is on its

01:08:55.625 --> 01:08:57.923
last round of ammunition.

01:08:58.082 --> 01:08:59.255
I'll never agree to

01:08:59.582 --> 01:09:00.926
your making peace.

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:02.881
If you really care about the Qing court,

01:09:03.625 --> 01:09:06.629
do something useful, donate your riches.

01:09:07.082 --> 01:09:09.461
Why don't you donate your
own money to the cause?

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.377
Yuan Shikai.

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:15.591
Empress Dowager,

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.923
as I had reported earlier,

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:21.171
we must have enough money
to support the army.

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:24.261
Yuan Shikai is indeed hard pressed.

01:09:41.292 --> 01:09:42.589
You love to argue

01:09:43.082 --> 01:09:45.131
all the time,

01:09:45.457 --> 01:09:47.711
pretending to be loyal ministers.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:49.384
Now

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:51.671
in times of crisis,

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:55.637
you've all become selfish.

01:09:55.917 --> 01:09:57.669
The dynasty is destined to fall.

01:09:58.958 --> 01:09:59.675
Your servant

01:10:00.208 --> 01:10:01.801
will give up all of his possessions.

01:10:02.292 --> 01:10:03.760
This is a time of crisis, I will lead

01:10:03.917 --> 01:10:05.965
my entire family to protect the country.

01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:06.500
Your servant

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:07.759
doesn't want a coffin,

01:10:07.917 --> 01:10:09.760
nor does he care about his ancestral grave.

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:12.461
If money can help destroy the rebels,

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.213
then

01:10:13.792 --> 01:10:14.964
I'll leave everything and

01:10:16.292 --> 01:10:17.794
return to my home village.

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:21.671
The Four Nations Bank has
been persuaded by Sun,

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.173
I'm afraid we won't receive

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.093
a cent of this loan.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:29.501
I know.

01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:32.505
Heaven will punish.

01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.801
Sun Wen for this.

01:10:34.958 --> 01:10:35.800
Empress Dowager,

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:38.006
even though we run out of money, food,

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:39.839
and ammunition,

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.010
we still have for centuries

01:10:42.292 --> 01:10:44.135
our loyal subjects.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.843
I only have this to say:

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:49.002
I will die for the Qing Dynasty.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:03.136
Sun Wen, your interference...

01:12:03.292 --> 01:12:04.919
with the Four Nations Bank loan

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:07.211
has generated controversy in China.

01:12:08.167 --> 01:12:10.590
This is the Prince Regents
order to assassinate you.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:15.717
This one

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:17.001
looks more like

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:18.794
a portrait of the deceased.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.093
I don't agree with you,

01:12:22.125 --> 01:12:24.048
but I respect your courage.

01:12:24.667 --> 01:12:25.668
I won't Kill you.

01:12:26.208 --> 01:12:27.460
I want to persuade you.

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:35.128
Sun Wen, we are both past middle age.

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:36.509
Confucius said,

01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.843
At 50, I knew my destiny.

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:40.959
He also said,

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.550
At 40, I am not deluded.

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.126
I've never wavered

01:12:44.292 --> 01:12:45.965
from my beliefs.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:48.676
I know Why you won't Kill me.

01:12:49.625 --> 01:12:50.877
You're a father,

01:12:51.292 --> 01:12:52.043
you know

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:53.801
the Qing court you serve

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.128
will eventually destroy your children.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:58.801
We all want a strong and bright China

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:01.465
for our children.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:04.251
Go,

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.047
I don't want to see you again.

01:13:06.792 --> 01:13:08.009
Mr. Jordan,

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:11.504
you're the first guest in my new house.

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:12.714
Now that you've moved to Beijing,

01:13:12.875 --> 01:13:14.673
we can see each other more often.

01:13:14.833 --> 01:13:15.504
Yes.

01:13:15.667 --> 01:13:17.920
I don't intend to leave the city this time.

01:13:20.417 --> 01:13:22.010
How's the situation in the South?

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:23.004
Difficult.

01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:26.959
Sun Wen and Huang Xing
are southern barbarians with big appetites.

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:30.170
You could have conquered Wuchang,

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.676
but you stopped.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.172
We all knew

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:34.880
the Qing Dynasty has run out of money,

01:13:35.042 --> 01:13:36.259
the end is near.

01:13:36.417 --> 01:13:38.169
You want to profit from the power balance

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.711
between the Qing court and
the revolutionary army.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:43.256
So now you want peace.

01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:45.885
What do you think

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.628
of this balance between
my left and right hands?

01:13:49.208 --> 01:13:51.051
Truth be told, I'm very impressed.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.209
But the revolutionaries won't talk to me.

01:13:57.917 --> 01:14:01.751
Now I understand.
Would you like us to extend a hand?

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:05.334
You...

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.674
We'll pave the way for you to negotiate
peace with the revolutionaries.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:16.802
It's not good for anyone
if fighting continues.

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:19.386
What's most important now
is holding onto power.

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:20.800
Real power.

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:22.544
I'm looking for a collaborator

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:25.712
to protect the interests
of Britain in China.

01:14:27.458 --> 01:14:29.506
Well, you've found him.

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:33.050
Military Governor, let me explain.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.923
I sent Keqiang to Shanghai

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:38.007
because of the overall strategy
of the revolutionary movement.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.050
I don't understand.

01:14:39.333 --> 01:14:40.084
The Wuchang uprising attracted

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.297
the world's attention.

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:42.589
Isn't that also part of
the overall strategy?

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:44.718
Since we can attack Nanjing,
why can't we defend Wuchang'?

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:45.592
In Wuchang,

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:47.627
we're in a stalemate with the Beiyang Army.

01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.256
Our trainee soliders
have suffered heavy casualties.

01:14:51.167 --> 01:14:51.963
In Nanjing,

01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:53.339
the enemy is weak.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.298
Our plan is to attack Nanjing,
than retake Wuchang.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:56.334
'That's our overall strategy.

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.547
This is the decision
made by the Tongmenghui.

01:14:58.708 --> 01:15:00.585
I must abide by it.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:03.799
Fine. Whatever you say.

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.881
But I won't go to Shanghai.

01:15:06.792 --> 01:15:07.759
Please understand,

01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:10.795
it hasn't been easy to
forge our paths together.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:12.459
My home is here.

01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:13.501
My power base is here.

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:14.589
Military Governor Li,

01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:16.760
it appears we won't be sharing

01:15:17.292 --> 01:15:19.135
the same path.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:24.546
My child, don't move.

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:26.134
Don't move.

01:15:26.917 --> 01:15:27.463
Lie down.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:29.384
Listen,

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:30.251
if you want to live,

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:31.418
we must amputate your leg.

01:15:31.583 --> 01:15:32.459
Can you hear me?

01:15:43.208 --> 01:15:44.050
Alcohol.

01:15:44.458 --> 01:15:45.584
It's fine.

01:15:49.125 --> 01:15:49.842
Ready?

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:54.002
- Be brave.
- We begin now.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.176
Listen to me.

01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:07.251
Listen to me.

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:14.755
Stop.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.501
Stop.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:25.467
Come.

01:16:26.083 --> 01:16:26.834
Take him away.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:16:59.967
You've said it before.

01:17:00.333 --> 01:17:01.585
So we failed.

01:17:01.958 --> 01:17:03.881
Haven't we failed before?

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:07.510
I'm talking to you.

01:17:12.958 --> 01:17:14.005
Idiot.

01:17:39.458 --> 01:17:40.584
Mr. Sun,

01:17:40.875 --> 01:17:42.627
telegram from England for you.

01:17:42.917 --> 01:17:43.759
Okay,

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.129
here you are.

01:17:45.417 --> 01:17:46.384
Thank you.

01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:49.839
Mr. Sun,

01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:52.920
I must inform you right away.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.466
The Four Nations Bank decided to hold off

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.298
on the loan to the Qing government.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:03.051
You once told me that.

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:04.675
Revolution is life,

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:06.672
not only living,

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:07.963
but fate.

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:11.210
I don't understand Revolution,

01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:14.962
but I've struggled and fought, I was angry.

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:17.548
I also knew,

01:18:18.292 --> 01:18:19.839
I'd end up as sacrifice

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:22.503
along with my father.

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:26.961
I wish your Revolution,

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.171
No,

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.127
wish our Revolution,

01:18:30.833 --> 01:18:32.301
every SUCCESS.

01:18:38.167 --> 01:18:39.259
Yat-sen.

01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:46.589
Yat-sen.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:48.342
Keqiang.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:50.421
Where are you?

01:18:50.583 --> 01:18:51.459
Keqiang

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:52.501
I'm here.

01:18:52.667 --> 01:18:53.418
Can you hear me?

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:54.459
I can.

01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:55.509
Where are you?

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.085
Huang Keqiang.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.501
Yat-sen.

01:19:03.417 --> 01:19:04.418
I'm starboard.

01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:06.005
Me too.

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:41.543
Keqiang.

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:45.051
At the Welcome ceremony,

01:19:45.542 --> 01:19:46.714
you have to put on

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:48.460
the revolutionary army uniform.

01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:49.376
Yes.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:54.044
Yat-sen.

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:55.877
Binglin, you're all here.

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:57.717
Not in first class?

01:19:57.875 --> 01:19:59.001
- No.
- Second class?

01:19:59.167 --> 01:19:59.967
No.

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:01.418
Yat-sen.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.593
It saved my life once.

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:06.501
Keqiang,

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:07.717
your hand.

01:20:08.917 --> 01:20:09.918
Guangzhou uprising.

01:20:12.167 --> 01:20:13.089
Doesn't matter.

01:20:15.625 --> 01:20:17.923
Yat-sen.

01:20:18.083 --> 01:20:18.959
Mr. Sun.

01:20:19.458 --> 01:20:20.129
Dunchu.

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:21.842
You're here.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.594
Yat-sen, we searched all
the way to the beam.

01:20:25.292 --> 01:20:25.963
You're all here.

01:20:27.292 --> 01:20:27.918
A hug.

01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:32.251
Let's go.

01:20:32.417 --> 01:20:34.090
Yat-sen, we waited so long for your return.

01:20:34.292 --> 01:20:35.669
Shiping, you haven't aged a bit.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:52.501
Mr. Sun,

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.047
after your ship departed from Europe,

01:20:54.208 --> 01:20:55.050
on your journey back,

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:56.676
what thoughts came over you?

01:20:57.083 --> 01:20:59.051
After 16 years of tribulations,

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.710
I've returned to my motherland.

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:01.459
Mr. Sun,

01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:03.468
we hear you've returned
with huge donations,

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.376
Is that true?

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:05.709
I don't have any money.

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:07.877
All I bring is the Revolutionary spirit.

01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:10.335
What is the ultimate
goal of the Revolution?

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:11.550
The goals of the Revolution are simple:

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:12.709
We overthrow imperial rule

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:13.842
and save our people.

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:14.709
Mr. Sun,

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:16.801
what did you tell

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:17.834
those bankers in Europe?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.922
I told them,

01:21:19.458 --> 01:21:21.335
it's the Chinese people

01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:22.584
who'll steer the fate of China,

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:23.626
not foreigners

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.465
or Manchu royalty.

01:21:26.125 --> 01:21:27.422
Mr. Sun, the north and south
are now negotiating peace.

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:28.755
What is your opinion?

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:30.209
My opinion is this:

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:32.840
We haven't reached our Revolutionary goal,
we won't negotiate.

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:38.834
Tie up them.

01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:50.505
Our position is that

01:22:50.708 --> 01:22:51.880
unless the Emperor abdicates,

01:22:52.042 --> 01:22:53.919
there'll be no peace agreement.

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:55.084
Our position is that

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:57.093
the monarchical system cannot change.

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.301
This is a family dinner. Shaochuan,

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.002
you're part of the family.

01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:16.672
Come, try this.

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:19.343
A specialty from home.

01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:21.044
Lotus root with glutinous rice.

01:23:22.208 --> 01:23:23.505
Come, sit.

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:27.546
General,

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:28.630
this is.

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:32.093
To thank you.

01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:34.836
You put in so much effort
in the negotiations.

01:23:35.292 --> 01:23:36.009
You've worked so hard.

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:38.001
Please tell me

01:23:38.667 --> 01:23:39.634
what's on your mind.

01:23:40.042 --> 01:23:41.294
You're the only one among Us

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.922
who knew Sun Wen.

01:23:43.333 --> 01:23:44.505
I want to know more about.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:45.877
Sun Wen.

01:23:46.125 --> 01:23:48.503
What type of a man is he?

01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:49.959
Zhang Shizhao said,

01:23:51.208 --> 01:23:53.882
China will rise because of Sun,

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:55.626
he's the person

01:23:55.833 --> 01:23:58.131
who'll revive the country.

01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:01.670
Miyazaki considers Sun

01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:03.551
a hero who will save China.

01:24:05.625 --> 01:24:07.719
Kang Youwei claimed Sun is illiterate.

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:10.545
Wu Zhihui says that Sun
is a hardworking scholar.

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:12.672
Some say he's like Robin Hood,

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:14.085
an outlaw.

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:16.551
Some say he's a real scholar,

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:19.678
an itinerant doctor holding a scalpel.

01:24:20.792 --> 01:24:22.840
Others call him

01:24:23.542 --> 01:24:25.385
a good-for-nothing liar.

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:28.672
There are many versions.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:30.338
Shaochuan,

01:24:32.083 --> 01:24:34.427
he has so many followers.

01:24:34.875 --> 01:24:37.003
How does he do it?

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.173
I did hear this from many people:

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:41.005
That Sun

01:24:41.667 --> 01:24:43.340
is selfless.

01:25:10.917 --> 01:25:12.339
A selfless person?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.469
Where in the world can We find one?

01:25:15.708 --> 01:25:16.709
It's been 2000 years,

01:25:16.875 --> 01:25:18.343
we can't wait any longer for.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.717
- China's first Republic.
- Representatives from

01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:20.717
the 17 provinces have decided

01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:22.047
not to elect a President,
but to elect a Grand Marshal.

01:25:22.333 --> 01:25:24.131
Mr. Sun, please sign.

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:26.173
A Grand Marshal cannot be head of state.

01:25:26.583 --> 01:25:27.880
We must elect a President.

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:28.921
On the Presidential election,

01:25:29.083 --> 01:25:30.710
should we wait to hear from Yuan Shikai?

01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:33.135
If he can really hasten
the Emperor's abdication...

01:25:34.708 --> 01:25:36.335
The negotiating parties
already made a pact.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.218
Whoever first deposes the Qing government
will become President.

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:39.968
Yuan Shikai hasn't deposed the Qing court.

01:25:40.125 --> 01:25:41.217
We didn't break our promise.

01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:42.589
It you insist on a Presidential election,

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:44.343
people will use that
as an excuse to resume fighting.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:45.251
So what?

01:25:45.417 --> 01:25:47.385
We fought and look what
we've achieved today.

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:48.088
Keqiang.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:50.378
If we resume fighting,
what are our chances of winning?

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.468
We have no money,

01:25:52.833 --> 01:25:53.880
morale is low,

01:25:54.125 --> 01:25:55.923
we have no sure chance of winning.

01:25:56.333 --> 01:25:57.425
How can we fight?

01:25:57.625 --> 01:25:58.296
This is impractical.

01:25:58.458 --> 01:25:59.801
When the revolutionary army had nothing,

01:25:59.958 --> 01:26:01.255
we were willing to sacrifice our lives.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:02.842
Now we have half a country,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.967
what are We afraid of?

01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:06.048
The international community
nee expressed support for Yuan Shikai.

01:26:06.542 --> 01:26:08.840
Overseas Chinese all hope that we could
setup e government as soon as possible

01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:09.834
and elect a President.

01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.005
To be safe,

01:26:11.167 --> 01:26:13.090
I think we should wait.

01:26:13.375 --> 01:26:15.218
If Yuan doesn't depose the Emperor
for another 100 years,

01:26:15.375 --> 01:26:16.718
do we still wait?

01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:19.427
Let's put pressure on him, now.

01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:20.960
If Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.547
do we have to keep our promise?

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:24.672
Even if Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,

01:26:24.792 --> 01:26:26.510
he isn't qualified to be President.

01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:27.668
Not true.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.676
If Yuan keeps his promise,

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:31.676
he can become President.

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:34.465
If you've promised him anyway,
why bother holding an election?

01:26:36.125 --> 01:26:37.001
Good question.

01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:40.965
It's Worth it.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:42.922
First,

01:26:43.458 --> 01:26:44.505
we have to establish

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:46.135
the concept of a Republic.

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:47.797
It's just like building a road

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:49.210
in the wilderness,

01:26:49.625 --> 01:26:51.753
so the Revolution can continue its path.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:53.422
In future, in China,

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.795
no one can turn back.

01:26:58.125 --> 01:26:58.921
Lie down.

01:27:01.417 --> 01:27:02.134
Against the wall.

01:27:02.292 --> 01:27:03.714
All of you.

01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:07.593
Against the wall.

01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:08.626
Against the wall.

01:27:13.083 --> 01:27:14.084
He's the assassin.

01:27:17.708 --> 01:27:18.425
Release him.

01:27:21.333 --> 01:27:22.801
Who sent you here?

01:27:24.458 --> 01:27:25.880
Sun Wen is a sinner,

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:28.344
he's corrupt,

01:27:28.542 --> 01:27:29.885
he's sullied the Qing dynasty,

01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:31.760
he's immoral,

01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:34.009
he misleads the people,

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:35.801
he's beyond pardon.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.173
Everyone can kill him.

01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:42.169
It's no use interrogating him.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.798
We live in entirely different worlds.

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:45.876
Yes.

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:47.800
Two days ago,

01:27:48.542 --> 01:27:50.215
on December 27,

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.968
provincial representatives voted

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:55.380
and approved

01:27:55.833 --> 01:27:59.337
the Provisional Government
Organizational Draft.

01:28:00.583 --> 01:28:03.553
They also approved the Presidential system

01:28:03.917 --> 01:28:04.759
as well as

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.547
the nomination of candidates.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:08.547
Elections will take place

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.798
today, December 29,

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:13.626
for the position of.

01:28:13.792 --> 01:28:15.260
Provisional President.

01:28:16.333 --> 01:28:17.676
I declare

01:28:17.917 --> 01:28:20.545
each of the 17 provinces,

01:28:21.250 --> 01:28:23.127
though some with more
representatives than others,

01:28:23.333 --> 01:28:25.176
is only given one vote.

01:28:25.708 --> 01:28:29.087
A candidate receiving
more the two-thirds of the votes

01:28:29.333 --> 01:28:31.381
will become Provisional President.

01:28:32.542 --> 01:28:33.839
Those in favor, raise their hands.

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:38.044
This is the Presidential ballot.

01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:41.211
Your decision is crucial.

01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:44.881
We hope you will not disappoint your people

01:28:45.417 --> 01:28:47.090
in your choice.

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:51.418
Please fill in your ballot.

01:29:16.792 --> 01:29:17.793
Homer.

01:29:19.667 --> 01:29:20.509
Sun.

01:29:20.667 --> 01:29:23.090
What are you doing here?

01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:26.421
The Presidential election
is ongoing in the conference hall.

01:29:26.917 --> 01:29:28.214
I'm one of the candidates.

01:29:29.917 --> 01:29:30.964
History,

01:29:31.417 --> 01:29:32.760
you're making history.

01:29:33.125 --> 01:29:34.627
I'm witnessing history.

01:29:35.292 --> 01:29:37.386
I'm standing right beside history.

01:29:37.542 --> 01:29:38.634
For thousands of years,

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:42.383
in Chinese history, we the people

01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.218
never received the opportunity to

01:29:44.375 --> 01:29:46.127
elect the head of government.

01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:47.796
Never.

01:29:48.625 --> 01:29:49.296
That

01:29:49.542 --> 01:29:51.169
is what we've been fighting for.

01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:54.128
Our people have been fighting
ongoing for so long.

01:29:54.333 --> 01:29:55.835
And now we've finally done it.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:29:59.793
Homer,

01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:01.468
when did you get here?

01:30:03.125 --> 01:30:04.798
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

01:30:05.375 --> 01:30:07.093
Now, as head of the Assembly...

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:08.467
I must be there.

01:30:08.667 --> 01:30:10.419
I declare the results.

01:30:10.875 --> 01:30:12.218
Out of a total of 17 votes,

01:30:12.583 --> 01:30:14.051
Sun Wen received 16.

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:17.424
The Provisional President
of the Republic of China is.

01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:19.175
Sun Wen.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:20.467
Dr. Sun,

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:21.626
I heard your name.

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:22.959
I told you,

01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:26.007
you'd be China's first President.

01:30:46.042 --> 01:30:47.510
Tang Shaoyi,

01:30:48.292 --> 01:30:51.262
didn't you say he's selfless?

01:30:51.625 --> 01:30:53.753
What an slap in the face.

01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:01.879
General.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.547
Go.

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:12.092
Order.

01:31:12.708 --> 01:31:14.085
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.218
to issue a joint telegram
against the Republic.

01:31:17.583 --> 01:31:20.427
Tang Shaoyi is sympathetic to the Republic,
unable to fulfill his duties,

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.798
he's dismissed as representative
to the negotiations.

01:31:22.958 --> 01:31:23.754
Yes.

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:25.834
Send a telegram to Wu Tingfang:

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.219
I recognize neither the
Nanjing Provisional Government

01:31:28.417 --> 01:31:30.419
nor its so-called President Sun Wen.

01:31:34.708 --> 01:31:35.425
Yat-sen,

01:31:35.583 --> 01:31:36.709
we just heard.

01:31:36.917 --> 01:31:38.214
Zhang Xun has amassed

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:40.048
his troops around Suzhou.

01:31:40.458 --> 01:31:41.050
Also,

01:31:41.208 --> 01:31:42.585
some Qing soldiers have been sighted

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:44.593
near Qinhuai River this afternoon.

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:45.459
Mr. President,

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:46.084
we advise

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:47.251
delaying the inauguration ceremony.

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:49.968
Yes, better to be cautious.

01:31:52.042 --> 01:31:53.885
Today is New Year's Day of 1912,

01:31:54.708 --> 01:31:56.585
everything is renewed.

01:31:57.292 --> 01:31:58.760
The Provisional President
of the Republic of China

01:31:58.917 --> 01:32:00.260
must be sworn in today.

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:02.168
Fine.

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:03.835
I'll take care of all security details

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.502
for the Provisional President.

01:32:07.375 --> 01:32:08.126
Photo session.

01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:10.627
Please, look here, here.

01:32:20.083 --> 01:32:22.051
I pledge to overthrow the Qing dynasty,

01:32:22.750 --> 01:32:24.218
strengthen the Republic of China,

01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:26.256
foster better livelihoods for all.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.335
These I promise to the people.

01:32:28.708 --> 01:32:29.880
I will follow them.

01:32:30.292 --> 01:32:31.293
I will serve the country with faith.

01:32:31.792 --> 01:32:32.964
I will serve all people.

01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:35.343
Until the hegemony of the Qing dynasty
is overthrown,

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:36.922
and the country has no strife,

01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:38.880
when China will stand tall in the World,

01:32:39.083 --> 01:32:40.426
recognized among nations.

01:32:40.958 --> 01:32:41.754
At that time,

01:32:42.042 --> 01:32:44.295
I will resign from the position of
Provisional President.

01:32:46.583 --> 01:32:48.756
This is my pledge to all citizens of China.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.251
Just now,

01:33:04.667 --> 01:33:07.216
I pledged myself as the
Provisional President.

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:08.338
Now,

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:09.884
I have a few words to add.

01:33:10.375 --> 01:33:11.092
Today,

01:33:11.833 --> 01:33:13.676
the Republic of China is established,

01:33:14.875 --> 01:33:17.378
but the feudal court still stands.

01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:20.173
Unless feudalism is uprooted,

01:33:20.833 --> 01:33:22.506
our Revolution isn't complete.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:25.547
I await

01:33:26.542 --> 01:33:27.509
the day

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:30.844
I'll relinquish my position

01:33:31.417 --> 01:33:32.168
to the person

01:33:32.542 --> 01:33:34.089
who carries through the abdication
of the Qing Emperor.

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:43.843
What's going on?

01:33:44.542 --> 01:33:47.136
I'd said it before,
we shouldn't rush to elect a President.

01:33:47.542 --> 01:33:50.011
The Beiyang Army has been mobilized,
war will erupt very soon.

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.592
I hear Yuan Shikai has
even engaged assassins.

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:52.967
Who's afraid of assassins?

01:33:53.875 --> 01:33:54.671
Mr. Sun,

01:33:55.042 --> 01:33:55.588
may I suggest,

01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:57.502
in view of the situation,

01:33:57.667 --> 01:33:58.793
please ponder this seriously.

01:33:59.208 --> 01:34:00.551
If Yuan Shikai doesn't
depose the Qing court,

01:34:00.708 --> 01:34:02.051
President Sun will not step down.

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:06.302
Does Mr. Sun want to indulge
in the position of President?

01:34:06.542 --> 01:34:07.668
Wang Zhaoming,

01:34:09.583 --> 01:34:11.051
Sun Wen isn't that type.

01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:12.589
Since he's so selfless,

01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:13.797
what's the harm of my asking?

01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.175
It's all about trust,

01:34:15.625 --> 01:34:16.296
belief,

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:17.592
and faith

01:34:17.833 --> 01:34:18.584
without any doubt.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:19.714
I'm only afraid of

01:34:20.375 --> 01:34:21.627
an all-out battle between North and South.

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:23.169
Who'd be responsible for that?

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:24.880
If our Revolution is
stolen by someone else,

01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:26.547
who'd be responsible for that?

01:34:27.583 --> 01:34:28.129
Huang Keqiang, you...

01:34:28.292 --> 01:34:28.713
Zhaoming.

01:34:28.875 --> 01:34:30.218
Stop arguing, please.

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.922
I protect you in front of everyone,

01:34:34.042 --> 01:34:35.840
but we must be frank behind closed doors.

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:38.385
You don't have to close any doors.

01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.217
Just say it, Keqiang.

01:34:42.625 --> 01:34:44.252
We cannot accede to any
of Yuan Shikai's demands.

01:34:47.875 --> 01:34:49.001
But he has the power.

01:34:49.208 --> 01:34:51.381
He can quickly depose the Qing court.

01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:53.676
To establish our Republic

01:34:53.833 --> 01:34:55.676
we need not only battles but also politics.

01:34:55.917 --> 01:34:56.918
This is Revolution,

01:34:57.167 --> 01:34:58.293
not giving a crown to someone else.

01:34:59.083 --> 01:34:59.879
Sun Wen,

01:35:00.625 --> 01:35:02.423
the Revolution doesn't
belong to any single person.

01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:04.501
Keqiang,

01:35:05.083 --> 01:35:06.209
what do you mean?

01:35:06.625 --> 01:35:07.171
You don't understand.

01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:08.334
Idon%?

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:10.672
You're accusing me of not
understanding politics.

01:35:11.417 --> 01:35:12.293
But I know Yuan Sl'1il<ai.

01:35:12.458 --> 01:35:13.300
Keqiang.

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:14.254
You've never seen

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.761
how he killed young men.

01:35:17.458 --> 01:35:18.801
I'm Worried.

01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:21.676
He might become an enemy of the Republic.

01:35:22.417 --> 01:35:23.134
He might

01:35:23.458 --> 01:35:24.710
even restore autocratic rule.

01:35:35.208 --> 01:35:38.052
It's my ninth wife's birthday.

01:35:39.792 --> 01:35:42.420
Westerners celebrate birthdays with cakes.

01:35:43.042 --> 01:35:43.964
But we don't.

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:46.343
We eat peaches.

01:35:46.667 --> 01:35:48.761
Look how festive they ere.

01:35:51.458 --> 01:35:52.584
It hurts.

01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:54.172
Please let go.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:55.876
It hurts.

01:35:56.042 --> 01:35:56.793
Where's Weiting?

01:35:57.167 --> 01:35:58.168
I need to talk to him.

01:35:58.708 --> 01:35:59.834
What happened?

01:36:00.167 --> 01:36:00.918
Weiting,

01:36:01.500 --> 01:36:02.422
let's step aside.

01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:04.756
What are you afraid of?

01:36:05.167 --> 01:36:06.464
So what if I want to revolt?

01:36:06.958 --> 01:36:07.709
So what?

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:10.843
It's high time

01:36:11.333 --> 01:36:14.052
we race against Sun Wen.

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:15.833
Look, they haven't been idle:

01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.593
Electing President,

01:36:17.917 --> 01:36:19.544
setting up government.

01:36:20.292 --> 01:36:21.635
The best peaches on the tree

01:36:21.792 --> 01:36:24.011
are picked clean by others.

01:36:27.083 --> 01:36:28.005
I'll kill you.

01:36:28.625 --> 01:36:29.842
You're a madman.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.092
Stop him. Stop him.

01:36:31.667 --> 01:36:32.919
Sputtering madness.

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:35.878
Help.

01:36:36.042 --> 01:36:37.089
Please stop him.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:38.755
Weiting.

01:36:38.917 --> 01:36:40.009
Calm down.

01:36:50.042 --> 01:36:51.760
Why did you hit him so hard?

01:36:52.083 --> 01:36:53.084
At this moment,

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.469
I can't afford even one mistake.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:57.626
You're right.

01:36:58.042 --> 01:36:58.964
It's simple.

01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:01.755
I'm sitting on a bed of nails.

01:37:03.375 --> 01:37:04.922
If I don't force the court,

01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:07.131
the situation is dire:

01:37:07.708 --> 01:37:09.756
The Revolutionaries
control half the country,

01:37:10.167 --> 01:37:12.636
I can't oppose them much longer.

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:17.963
But if the Emperor abdicates because of me,

01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:20.878
I'll be blamed for generations to come.

01:37:21.167 --> 01:37:22.464
This is indeed

01:37:23.083 --> 01:37:24.175
a tricky situation.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:25.425
The crux of the matter is,

01:37:25.708 --> 01:37:28.336
I want to become President.

01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:01.050
When I arrived,

01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:03.465
I was resentful.

01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:05.842
But now that I've seen you,

01:38:06.958 --> 01:38:08.426
I'm no longer angry.

01:38:17.875 --> 01:38:18.967
Now,

01:38:20.875 --> 01:38:23.958
our baby is inside me.

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:39.963
Keqiang,

01:38:40.958 --> 01:38:42.585
this painting will soon be finished.

01:38:44.875 --> 01:38:46.468
But I can't decide

01:38:48.417 --> 01:38:49.259
where to hang it.

01:38:53.167 --> 01:38:54.214
I want to propose.

01:38:54.917 --> 01:38:56.760
Wu Tingfang to issue a public statement.

01:38:57.167 --> 01:38:58.464
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,

01:38:58.667 --> 01:38:59.919
the ceasefire will end.

01:39:00.292 --> 01:39:01.339
Whoever tarries,

01:39:01.542 --> 01:39:02.714
whoever resists,

01:39:03.042 --> 01:39:04.510
will be punished by all.

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:05.880
If the truce cannot be maintained,

01:39:06.167 --> 01:39:07.339
we'll declare war again.

01:39:07.958 --> 01:39:08.959
If we resume war,

01:39:09.542 --> 01:39:10.794
I'll lead the troops to the North.

01:39:12.167 --> 01:39:12.668
Keqiang.

01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:14.130
You were right.

01:39:14.333 --> 01:39:15.505
I've thought long and hard.

01:39:16.042 --> 01:39:18.841
We have to establish provisional laws.

01:39:20.958 --> 01:39:22.960
It's unimportant who serves a single term.

01:39:23.375 --> 01:39:24.422
We must establish

01:39:24.583 --> 01:39:25.926
a system

01:39:28.375 --> 01:39:30.298
to restrain not only Yuan Shikai

01:39:30.917 --> 01:39:31.588
but

01:39:32.042 --> 01:39:34.340
anyone who ever dreams
of becoming an emperor.

01:39:35.417 --> 01:39:35.918
Painter,

01:39:36.625 --> 01:39:38.047
please use bright red for
the flag with 18 stars.

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:38.925
Yes.

01:39:42.208 --> 01:39:45.291
Comradres, I hear you are

01:39:45.542 --> 01:39:46.589
disputing my resignation,

01:39:47.167 --> 01:39:50.421
but it takes more than a day

01:39:50.583 --> 01:39:52.506
of feudal hegemony.

01:39:52.875 --> 01:39:54.627
I do hope you will not just focus on

01:39:54.792 --> 01:39:56.044
one official title,

01:39:56.250 --> 01:39:58.423
but create a truly relevant,

01:39:58.583 --> 01:40:00.631
legally protected revolutionary system.

01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:03.002
Those who follow the righteous path thrive,

01:40:03.292 --> 01:40:05.090
those who do not become extinct.

01:40:05.375 --> 01:40:07.173
I hold fast to the Revolution,

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.127
knowing it will bear fruit.

01:40:09.667 --> 01:40:10.919
After such a long journey,

01:40:11.292 --> 01:40:12.760
we will reach our revolutionary goal.

01:40:12.917 --> 01:40:16.251
What does Sun Wen want?

01:40:17.958 --> 01:40:19.084
What telegram?

01:40:20.292 --> 01:40:22.636
What declaration? What war?

01:40:29.625 --> 01:40:31.798
Mr. Jordan is right.

01:40:32.208 --> 01:40:34.427
It is most important to hold onto power.

01:40:39.292 --> 01:40:42.341
The President's chair isn't comfortable.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.922
Even if it's full of pins,

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:47.798
I still Want to sit on it.

01:40:48.458 --> 01:40:51.883
The British Ambassador told me:

01:40:52.708 --> 01:40:56.508
That winter, like today,

01:40:57.292 --> 01:41:00.466
the winds were chilly,

01:41:00.875 --> 01:41:02.798
it was snowing.

01:41:04.583 --> 01:41:06.677
It was around Spring Festival,

01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:09.924
but the entire city was desolate,

01:41:10.292 --> 01:41:13.045
the atmosphere almost tragic.

01:41:14.333 --> 01:41:15.459
The guillotine was placed

01:41:15.917 --> 01:41:17.840
in the middle of the public square,

01:41:18.833 --> 01:41:20.255
icicles of blood

01:41:20.542 --> 01:41:23.011
still hanging on the blade.

01:41:24.542 --> 01:41:26.294
Louis XVI

01:41:26.875 --> 01:41:28.468
was bound and taken there.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:32.591
He was cold, without even a coat.

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.673
He was shivering.

01:41:35.542 --> 01:41:37.419
Everyone brought their family

01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:40.674
to witness this great occasion.

01:41:42.250 --> 01:41:45.174
When the hour came,

01:41:45.458 --> 01:41:47.085
the executioner put the
King's head on the block,

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:49.173
the blade was released,

01:41:49.542 --> 01:41:51.294
there was ice on his face.

01:41:51.458 --> 01:41:52.755
Listen...

01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:56.050
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

01:41:56.333 --> 01:41:56.925
Go on.

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:58.255
Listen.

01:41:59.542 --> 01:42:00.839
The whoosh of the blade.

01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:04.336
The whoosh of the blade. Then?

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:05.877
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

01:42:06.708 --> 01:42:08.210
Then, the end.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:12.671
The end?

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:14.176
That quick?

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.217
Yuan Shikai,

01:42:16.375 --> 01:42:19.675
you're kidding.

01:42:19.917 --> 01:42:21.294
You're making this up.

01:42:21.625 --> 01:42:24.219
You've made up this story
from the West for me.

01:42:24.375 --> 01:42:26.628
I reappointed you against
my better conscience,

01:42:26.833 --> 01:42:28.961
yet you do this to me?

01:42:30.208 --> 01:42:31.676
Royal Prince, appease your anger.

01:42:31.958 --> 01:42:35.212
Did the French also
celebrate Spring Festival?

01:42:36.542 --> 01:42:37.919
Royal Prince, calm down.

01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:40.092
Royal Prince.

01:42:47.792 --> 01:42:49.135
I've received news that.

01:42:49.333 --> 01:42:51.927
Sun Wen insists on a Republic.
They will not compromise.

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:53.421
Empress Dowager,

01:42:53.833 --> 01:42:55.756
I tell you the story of
the French Revolution

01:42:56.208 --> 01:42:59.587
because I don't want you and the princes

01:42:59.750 --> 01:43:01.127
to share the same fate.

01:43:01.333 --> 01:43:03.176
I'm loyal to you.

01:43:03.583 --> 01:43:05.585
Heaven can attest to it.

01:43:10.042 --> 01:43:10.838
Yuan Shikai,

01:43:12.333 --> 01:43:13.004
come over here.

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:27.919
Come over here.

01:43:42.292 --> 01:43:43.259
Empress Dowager

01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.423
I'm at your command.

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:55.793
What if

01:43:56.458 --> 01:43:57.835
that day comes?

01:43:58.917 --> 01:44:01.170
You won't let Us

01:44:01.792 --> 01:44:02.884
face the guillotine,

01:44:04.875 --> 01:44:07.344
you won't let us starve.

01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:09.093
Certainly.

01:44:13.208 --> 01:44:13.834
Go back.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.001
The South is eager to resume battle,

01:44:15.208 --> 01:44:16.755
Empress Dowager, please ponder this.

01:44:20.417 --> 01:44:21.213
I know.

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:27.127
I take my leave.

01:44:40.333 --> 01:44:42.427
- Prince Regent.
- Here.

01:44:42.875 --> 01:44:44.422
Yuan Shikai has broken his promise,

01:44:44.708 --> 01:44:45.800
he's banded with the rebels.

01:44:46.167 --> 01:44:47.168
I do regret this.

01:44:47.542 --> 01:44:50.295
I dismiss him as Prime Minister.

01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:51.968
Things have developed thus.

01:44:55.375 --> 01:44:58.675
It won't help.

01:45:13.208 --> 01:45:16.007
They're still dragging their feet,
prolonging their dynasty?

01:45:16.292 --> 01:45:17.418
They are acting against people's wishes.

01:45:17.583 --> 01:45:18.709
How they overreach themselves.

01:45:18.917 --> 01:45:20.385
They're becoming enemies of all people.

01:45:20.667 --> 01:45:22.260
What a pipe dream,

01:45:22.417 --> 01:45:24.761
thinking they can still hang on.

01:45:26.833 --> 01:45:27.550
What happened?

01:45:28.042 --> 01:45:28.884
Mr. Sun.

01:45:33.542 --> 01:45:34.043
What is it?

01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:35.718
Send a telegram,

01:45:36.917 --> 01:45:38.294
make it public.

01:45:40.542 --> 01:45:43.295
The Revolutionary Party's
patience is running out.

01:45:44.250 --> 01:45:47.049
Don't these feudalists have any shame?

01:45:48.292 --> 01:45:49.509
Reporting to the Empress Dowager:

01:45:50.083 --> 01:45:52.177
Our Ambassador to Russia
and others have sent telegrams to you,

01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:56.584
hoping that you treasure the Chinese people
rather than insisting on one man's position.

01:45:57.417 --> 01:46:00.671
There are mutinies in the Northeast,
Xinjiang and Tibet.

01:46:01.167 --> 01:46:04.341
43 generals, including Feng Guozhang
and Duan Qirui,

01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:06.172
have signed a petition in
support of the Republic.

01:46:06.458 --> 01:46:08.711
Tell me something I don't already know.

01:46:12.708 --> 01:46:13.584
Empress Dowager.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:17.129
We have served you and the royal court.
We do not support the idea of a Republic.

01:46:17.917 --> 01:46:19.794
Please do not falter in your position.

01:46:19.958 --> 01:46:21.426
Why would I falter?

01:46:23.458 --> 01:46:25.586
It's all Yuan Shikai's doing.

01:46:25.792 --> 01:46:27.419
Yuan had betrayed Emperor Guangxu,

01:46:27.625 --> 01:46:28.797
now he betrays Emperor Xuantong.

01:46:28.958 --> 01:46:30.710
He's a real traitor.

01:46:30.875 --> 01:46:31.967
His family has received
such grace from the court,

01:46:32.125 --> 01:46:33.297
yet he's such an unfilial cur.

01:46:33.458 --> 01:46:34.880
He has the ambition of Wang Mang
in becoming Emperor.

01:46:35.042 --> 01:46:36.339
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,

01:46:36.625 --> 01:46:38.673
he can't make his deal.

01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:41.094
I'd told you before,
he's not to be trusted.

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:42.467
As long as Aisin Gioro is here,

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:44.218
the Qing Dynasty will not fall.

01:46:44.375 --> 01:46:45.968
Ancestors in Heaven,

01:46:47.292 --> 01:46:48.043
HOW

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:49.877
other countries bully us,

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.672
the Revolutionaries run wild,

01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:54.335
our ministers are corrupt,

01:46:54.583 --> 01:46:55.960
they sell whatever they can

01:46:56.333 --> 01:46:57.926
for their own gains.

01:46:58.958 --> 01:47:00.380
There's nothing left now.

01:47:01.042 --> 01:47:02.840
We have failed you.

01:47:04.917 --> 01:47:05.884
At least Sun Wen

01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:07.510
is Clement.

01:47:07.792 --> 01:47:08.759
He doesn't invade the Palace,

01:47:09.208 --> 01:47:10.460
there are no guillotines.

01:47:11.292 --> 01:47:13.260
We want a bloodless revolution,

01:47:13.500 --> 01:47:14.752
no more sacrifices...

01:47:15.083 --> 01:47:17.051
or needless killings.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.627
Abdicate.

01:47:49.458 --> 01:47:50.425
Friends, greetings.

01:47:51.625 --> 01:47:53.753
This is a historical day,

01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:55.255
let's begin.

01:47:56.458 --> 01:47:58.005
- Mr. President, this way.
- Let's

01:47:58.458 --> 01:47:59.675
have a pose.

01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:00.841
How?

01:48:01.250 --> 01:48:03.594
- Mr. President, please lift up your hat.
- OK.

01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:05.343
Let's change a bit.

01:48:05.542 --> 01:48:07.089
Mr. President, this way.

01:48:07.458 --> 01:48:09.131
Mr. President, you look so young.

01:48:10.583 --> 01:48:11.755
Such glib words.

01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:15.176
When you cut my queue,

01:48:15.542 --> 01:48:16.634
don't hurry,

01:48:16.875 --> 01:48:18.001
take your time,

01:48:18.167 --> 01:48:19.589
move slowly.

01:48:19.917 --> 01:48:22.841
This is a historical
moment, do you understand?

01:48:23.292 --> 01:48:23.963
Yes.

01:48:25.292 --> 01:48:28.011
You talk about Revolution
and Republic all the time.

01:48:28.542 --> 01:48:30.670
A Revolutionary has to
have a Revolutionary look.

01:48:30.833 --> 01:48:33.803
Let me show you.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:34.842
Look.

01:48:45.458 --> 01:48:46.755
Ambassadors,

01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:51.333
Today I meet you as the
Provisional President

01:48:52.042 --> 01:48:53.339
for the first time,

01:48:58.708 --> 01:48:59.880
also the last time.

01:49:02.583 --> 01:49:03.926
I can't believe this.

01:49:04.792 --> 01:49:06.135
Before I leave the Presidency,

01:49:06.708 --> 01:49:09.086
I hope you will request
your respective governments

01:49:09.625 --> 01:49:11.878
to recognize our new country.

01:49:12.833 --> 01:49:13.834
To you

01:49:14.042 --> 01:49:15.134
and to the entire world,

01:49:15.333 --> 01:49:16.459
this is truly significant.

01:49:16.625 --> 01:49:17.501
Mr. President,

01:49:17.667 --> 01:49:20.216
how do you plan to treat
the Qing royal family?

01:49:20.875 --> 01:49:22.798
They'll become citizens of the Republic.

01:49:25.333 --> 01:49:26.630
The Revolutionary Party has decided

01:49:26.792 --> 01:49:28.965
to pay the royal family 4
million taels of silver.

01:49:29.167 --> 01:49:30.714
Is that how you treat your citizens?

01:49:30.875 --> 01:49:32.877
Money cannot be a measure here.

01:49:33.792 --> 01:49:35.886
Not all revolutions need guillotines.

01:49:36.417 --> 01:49:37.714
What do you say, Mr. Ambassador?

01:49:38.333 --> 01:49:40.131
I agree.

01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:43.002
When I was in England,

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:45.218
I once met one of your
parliament members, Mr. Hillier.

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.217
I told him,

01:49:46.708 --> 01:49:48.802
when China is freed,

01:49:49.542 --> 01:49:50.919
I'd invite him as my guest.

01:49:52.292 --> 01:49:54.215
I'll use Chinese liquor,

01:49:54.667 --> 01:49:55.668
Revolutionary liquor, to toast him.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:57.717
Come,

01:49:58.542 --> 01:49:59.213
cheers.

01:49:59.667 --> 01:50:01.294
Minbao, Xinwenbao and other newspapers

01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:03.923
nave published articles questioning
your decision to step down.

01:50:04.458 --> 01:50:05.459
I read them.

01:50:06.042 --> 01:50:07.043
We're in financial trouble.

01:50:07.333 --> 01:50:10.052
We can't find funds for restitutions
to the martyrs' families.

01:50:10.458 --> 01:50:11.084
We must find some money

01:50:11.542 --> 01:50:12.839
no matter how.

01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:16.343
People's representatives want to meet you.

01:50:16.875 --> 01:50:17.876
Please set up a time.

01:50:19.083 --> 01:50:19.584
Yes.

01:50:19.875 --> 01:50:21.001
Homer Lea is determined

01:50:21.167 --> 01:50:22.635
to resign from his post
as Military Advisor.

01:50:23.250 --> 01:50:24.001
What's his reason?

01:50:24.167 --> 01:50:26.420
He said he won't Work with Yuan Shikai.

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:30.342
Tell him,

01:50:31.125 --> 01:50:32.377
he's helping China,

01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:33.672
not just a person.

01:50:37.417 --> 01:50:39.010
This is a letter from Juemin.

01:50:39.667 --> 01:50:41.419
Yat-serfs been Keeping it for you.

01:50:41.958 --> 01:50:43.005
He asks that I give it to you.

01:50:48.917 --> 01:50:51.921
A few days ego,
members of the Tongmenghui came to see me.

01:50:52.167 --> 01:50:53.965
They are planning a new grave.

01:50:56.375 --> 01:50:58.298
They asked that I prepare
a funerary outfit.

01:51:00.375 --> 01:51:01.797
I went to the shop.

01:51:03.125 --> 01:51:04.843
When he was alive,

01:51:05.958 --> 01:51:07.380
Juemin and I always made
decisions together.

01:51:10.333 --> 01:51:11.300
So I asked,

01:51:13.875 --> 01:51:14.842
Juemin,

01:51:16.167 --> 01:51:17.794
which one do you want?

01:51:29.875 --> 01:51:31.297
Only then did I know

01:51:33.708 --> 01:51:36.006
he's no longer with me.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.001
Zhongxin,

01:51:54.292 --> 01:51:56.090
this is a letter from your father.

01:52:01.208 --> 01:52:02.334
Look.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.343
"Letter to My Wife"

01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:14.336
shouldn't be kept only in this household.

01:52:16.208 --> 01:52:17.676
Keep it,

01:52:18.417 --> 01:52:20.385
let others know about it.

01:52:48.167 --> 01:52:48.963
Yesterday,

01:52:49.375 --> 01:52:50.592
the Qing Emperor abdicated,

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.628
ending two millennia of monarchy.

01:52:54.417 --> 01:52:56.044
Countless revolutionaries
have given up their lives

01:52:56.250 --> 01:52:58.173
for our new Republic.

01:53:00.458 --> 01:53:01.084
Today,

01:53:01.333 --> 01:53:03.927
February 13, 1912,

01:53:04.417 --> 01:53:06.419
26th day of the 12th
moon of the Xinhai Year.

01:53:07.833 --> 01:53:09.005
Keep my promise,

01:53:09.292 --> 01:53:11.420
I resign from the post of President.

01:53:13.417 --> 01:53:14.919
We strive for the success
of the Revolution,

01:53:15.292 --> 01:53:16.885
but do not covet recognition.

01:53:17.625 --> 01:53:19.377
We are all of the same minds

01:53:19.833 --> 01:53:22.086
to realize the goal of Revolution.

01:53:23.250 --> 01:53:24.126
The goal is to establish

01:53:24.583 --> 01:53:26.836
an independent country
for the Chinese people.

01:53:27.208 --> 01:53:29.711
We build a Chinese Republic
where land is divided among all.

01:53:30.292 --> 01:53:33.375
Nationalism, democracy, livelihood:

01:53:33.958 --> 01:53:36.586
These are what we strive to attain,

01:53:36.875 --> 01:53:38.252
Three Principles.

01:53:46.083 --> 01:53:47.630
Today you ask me,

01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:49.968
what does Revolution mean?

01:53:50.750 --> 01:53:53.378
Perhaps people will ask the same question
a century later.

01:53:54.208 --> 01:53:58.042
Qiu Jin, our Tongmenghui member
who was killed in Shaoxing, said,

01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.969
Revolution will provide all children

01:54:01.292 --> 01:54:04.262
a peaceful and gentle world.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:09.925
Lin Juemin, one of the martyrs of
Huanghuagang, wrote this to his wife:

01:54:11.250 --> 01:54:15.505
Revolution seeks eternal happiness
for everyone in the World.

01:54:17.958 --> 01:54:19.210
I believe

01:54:19.792 --> 01:54:22.215
the Revolution enables a republican system

01:54:22.375 --> 01:54:24.343
to reach the people.

01:54:25.042 --> 01:54:27.465
People will understand we'll fight whoever

01:54:27.625 --> 01:54:29.377
dares support the monarchy.

01:54:29.875 --> 01:54:32.845
Revolution enables factories,

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:36.212
banks, rail roads, mines

01:54:36.583 --> 01:54:39.666
owned by Chinese to benefit the people.

01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:43.879
Revolution enables our Chinese
race to become strong,

01:54:44.083 --> 01:54:46.632
no longer bullied by others.

01:54:46.792 --> 01:54:49.295
We will no longer be slaves.

01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.673
Revolution can take place anywhere,

01:54:53.917 --> 01:54:55.214
anytime,

01:54:55.375 --> 01:54:57.048
in any heart,

01:54:57.542 --> 01:54:58.589
forever,

01:54:59.083 --> 01:55:00.255
forever,

01:55:00.958 --> 01:55:02.631
no longer afraid of foreign powers,

01:55:03.083 --> 01:55:04.835
ridding the country of
feudalism and royalty.

01:55:05.208 --> 01:55:07.176
No one will be impoverished,

01:55:07.458 --> 01:55:10.758
and the Chinese people can
stand tall in the East.

01:55:11.875 --> 01:55:14.128
This is the meaning of Revolution.
