WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:08.509
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.609 --> 00:12.346
WE'RE LYING THERE FACE
TO FACE, PETTING EACH OTHER
LIKE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS.

00:12.446 --> 00:16.284
ONE THING SEEMS
PERFECTLY PLAIN TO ME:
YOU SLEPT WITH MY PATIENT.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.851
HE DOESN'T BELONG
TO YOU.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.588
HE'S A GREAT GUY--
A LITTLE INSECURE
IN BED MAYBE,

00:20.688 --> 00:22.956
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA
HAVE A TREMENDOUS AFFAIR
WITH HIM.

00:23.057 --> 00:26.327
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
WHEN I WAS FUCKING ALEX,
I WAS ACTUALLY FUCKING YOU?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.562
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE,
"LOOK WHAT YOU MISSED
OUT ON, PAUL,

00:28.662 --> 00:30.431
YOU COWARD, YOU IDIOT."

00:30.531 --> 00:32.032
PAUL, IF THERE'S ONE
THING I'VE PUT RIGHT
OUT THERE

00:32.133 --> 00:33.901
WITHOUT HINTING
OR MANIPULATION

00:34.001 --> 00:36.003
IT'S THAT I'VE WANTED YOU.

00:36.104 --> 00:39.773
THERE'S MORE INTIMACY
BETWEEN US THAN MOST
COUPLES IN THE WORLD.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.275
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.311
WELL, I DON'T DENY THAT
THERE'S A CERTAIN INTIMACY--

00:43.411 --> 00:45.913
IS THERE INTIMACY HERE
OR NOT?

00:46.013 --> 00:49.717
YES, THERE IS.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.431
( theme music playing )

01:56.784 --> 01:58.752
I'M SORRY.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.462
LAURA, I THINK THAT

02:08.562 --> 02:12.700
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
IN A LITTLE GREATER DETAIL

02:12.800 --> 02:14.268
YOUR ENDING THERAPY.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.837
WE'RE NOT STOPPING YET,

02:16.937 --> 02:18.472
BUT IN ORDER
TO DO IT GRADUALLY,

02:18.572 --> 02:22.410
WE HAVE TO CREATE
WHAT WE CALL A TIMELINE.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.879
NO TIMELINE.
WE'RE FINISHING TODAY.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.883
YEAH, TODAY.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.453
THIS IS
OUR LAST SESSION.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.565
GOOD.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.800
FEELS GOOD.

02:47.968 --> 02:51.639
RESOLVED, I GUESS.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.574
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
ABOUT TELLING YOU,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.644
BUT NOW THAT THAT'S OVER,
I FEEL BETTER, RELIEVED,

02:56.744 --> 03:00.681
( sighs )
MAYBE A LITTLE TIRED.

03:02.216 --> 03:05.753
AND...

03:05.853 --> 03:07.888
AND SAD.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

03:07.988 --> 03:10.558
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

03:10.658 --> 03:13.427
I'M SORRY, IS THAT
NOT OKAY FOR ME TO ASK?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.529
NO, IT'S PERFECTLY OKAY.

03:15.629 --> 03:19.533
OH, GOOD, SO...
TELL ME.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.372
WELL, TO BE HONEST,

03:24.472 --> 03:26.374
IT'S COME AS A BIT
OF A SHOCK.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.909
SHOCK.
WELL, OKAY, WHAT ELSE?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.380
WELL, I FEEL SAD, TOO.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.849
- RIGHT.
- YES, I DO.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.818
- YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
- IT JUST DOESN'T
LOOK THAT WAY.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.855
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
HOLDING BACK THIS HUGE
SIGH OF RELIEF,

03:41.955 --> 03:44.758
THIS HUGE GULP
OF AIR TRAPPED
IN YOUR LUNGS.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.495
SEE, I'M TRAINED
TO SEE THAT STUFF,
REMEMBER?

03:47.595 --> 03:51.865
MONITORING RESPIRATION--
THAT'S ANESTHESIOLOGY 101.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.003
GO AHEAD, LET IT GO.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.439
EXHALE.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.811
NO?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.146
WELL...

04:06.246 --> 04:08.816
MAYBE I'M
A LOUSY DOCTOR.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.856
SO HOW'S
YOUR WEEK BEEN?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.258
( scoffs )

04:18.359 --> 04:21.028
DON'T ASK ME
ABOUT MY WEEK.
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.532
HOW TERRIBLE?

04:27.167 --> 04:29.036
I WAS IN SURGERY
ON FRIDAY

04:29.136 --> 04:31.472
AND THIS 15-YEAR-OLD
GIRL,

04:31.572 --> 04:35.343
SHE HAD THIS TUMOR
ON HER CHEEK.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.245
IT WAS NOTHING--
BENIGN, COSMETIC.

04:38.346 --> 04:40.481
AND EVERYTHING'S
GOING GREAT, RIGHT?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.850
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THE ANESTHETIC.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.186
AND MY ATTENDING GETS
CALLED AWAY TO CONSULT
ON A PROCEDURE

04:46.286 --> 04:48.889
AND THE SURGERY ENDED
FASTER THAN NORMAL.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.624
IT WAS SIMPLE.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.293
AND I'M LEFT WITH HER
STILL ANESTHETIZED.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.896
SO I CALLED
TO ASK WHAT TO DO.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.966
I'D NEVER BEEN IN THAT
SITUATION BEFORE WITH A
PATIENT WHO'S NEVER WOKEN UP.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.868
AND THEY TOLD ME
TO TAKE HER

05:00.968 --> 05:02.903
INTO THE RECOVERY ROOM.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.906
SHE WAS STILL INTUBATED,
AND THE ATTENDING WAS
SUPPOSED TO REMOVE THE TUBE

05:06.006 --> 05:08.576
WHEN SHE WAKES UP.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.780
SHE WAS A SWEET GIRL,
PRETTY.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.549
MICHELLE WAS HER NAME.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.519
BEFORE THE OP,
I WAS TALKING TO HER MOM

05:18.619 --> 05:20.488
WHO TOLD ME THAT
SHE'D BEEN ASKING
FOR THIS OPERATION

05:20.588 --> 05:22.856
SINCE SHE WAS 9--

05:22.956 --> 05:25.626
THEY RECOMMENDED THAT
SHE PUT IT OFF
FOR A WHILE--

05:25.726 --> 05:28.228
AND HOW
SHE WASN'T AFRAID,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.330
JUST WANTED
THIS THING GONE,

05:30.431 --> 05:32.933
THIS FATTY LUMP
OFF HER PRETTY FACE.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.039
AND THEN SUDDENLY,
SHE WASN'T BREATHING.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.642
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, PAUL.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.977
I TOOK HER INTO RECOVERY
AND TWO MINUTES LATER
SHE WAS BLUE.

05:44.077 --> 05:48.416
I MEAN, ATCHESON--
HE'S THE SENIOR ATTENDING--

05:48.516 --> 05:50.017
HE PUSHED ME ASIDE
AND POUNCED ON HER

05:50.117 --> 05:53.554
WITH CHEST COMPRESSIONS.
I HAD NO IDEA WHAT
WENT WRONG, PAUL.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.556
THEY EXTUBATED HER,
AND SHE WAS BREATHING.

05:55.656 --> 05:59.359
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.
IT WAS OKAY.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.265
HOW DID YOU FEEL
DURING THOSE FEW MINUTES

06:05.365 --> 06:07.300
WHEN THE...

06:07.401 --> 06:10.170
FANTASTIC,
NEVER BETTER.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.473
I FELT LIKE SHIT.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
I ONLY LOOK COMPETENT,
PAUL,

06:14.675 --> 06:18.045
YOU KNOW-- WHITE COAT,
STETHOSCOPE,
PEN IN POCKET.

06:18.145 --> 06:22.182
I'M LIKE THOSE DOCTORS
FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL
ADS. YOU KNOW,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.452
LIKE, HAND ON HIP,

06:24.552 --> 06:27.087
BROW A LITTLE FURROWED
WITH CONCERN,

06:27.187 --> 06:30.057
NICE SMILE.
I HAVE A PRETTY
SMILE, RIGHT?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.092
MM-HMM.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.168
DO YOU EXPECT THAT
NOTHING WILL EVER GO
WRONG WITH A PATIENT?

06:41.268 --> 06:43.403
I DROPPED THE BALL.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.238
BUT IS THAT WHAT

06:45.338 --> 06:47.074
THE ATTENDING CONCLUDED?

06:47.174 --> 06:50.077
I MEAN, COULDN'T IT HAVE
BEEN SOMETHING ELSE,
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

06:50.177 --> 06:53.914
- AN ALLERGIC REACTION,
A DROP IN BLOOD--
- IT'S ALWAYS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

06:58.586 --> 07:02.523
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE
ABOUT THAT GIRL.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.727
SHE HAD BRACES.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.432
AND THROUGH HER SURGICAL
CAP, YOU COULD SEE--

07:12.533 --> 07:14.835
WHAT DO THEY CALL IT?
THE BARRETTES,

07:14.935 --> 07:18.806
LITTLE BUTTERFLIES
PINNING BACK HER BANGS.
THEY WERE OLD.

07:18.906 --> 07:23.577
MUST HAVE HER MOTHER'S
OR FROM A THRIFT STORE
OR SOMETHING.

07:23.677 --> 07:26.747
AND SHE HAD THESE
BEAUTIFUL HANDS,

07:26.847 --> 07:28.415
GORGEOUS HANDS. I MEAN,
SHE'S JUST A GIRL,

07:28.516 --> 07:32.319
AND SHE HAD THESE HANDS
OF A WOMAN--

07:32.419 --> 07:36.056
VERY LONG FINGERS,
PRETTY LITTLE NAILS.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.358
SHIT, WHEN I WAS HER AGE
I USED TO EAT MY NAILS.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.095
I MEAN, THEY WERE UGLY
AND STUBBY AND SHORT.
NERVES, I GUESS.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.765
WHY WERE YOU NERVOUS?

07:46.534 --> 07:48.736
WELL, IT WAS, YOU KNOW,
AROUND THE TIME

07:48.836 --> 07:51.004
THAT MY MOTHER
PASSED AWAY, SO...

07:54.041 --> 07:56.977
AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY
WERE YOU THEN?

07:57.077 --> 07:59.212
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.883
WELL, WHO WAS
TAKING CARE OF YOU?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.218
YOU MEAN WHO WAS
WATCHING MY SLEEP?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.487
YEAH.

08:07.588 --> 08:11.291
I WASN'T THAT GIRL
ON THE OPERATING
TABLE, PAUL.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.394
NO, IT'S JUST
THAT YOU TOLD ME THAT
WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED,

08:14.494 --> 08:17.430
THAT IT WAS LIKE
A KIND OF A DEATH
FOR YOU TOO.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.833
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHIT HAPPENS.

08:19.933 --> 08:23.336
LIFE ISN'T FAIR.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO, SUE GOD?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.739
WELL, WHO WOULD YOU SUE?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.876
YOU.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.981
NO, SUING YOU WOULDN'T
DO ME ANY GOOD, EITHER.

08:34.081 --> 08:37.517
THAT'S MY PROBLEM
WITH PSYCHOLOGY, PAUL.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.119
YOU DIG AND YOU DIG

08:39.219 --> 08:42.122
AND YOU UNCOVER ALL SORTS
OF TRUTHS ABOUT YOURSELF,

08:42.222 --> 08:44.524
AND YOU TOUCH ON ALL SORTS
OF PAINFUL PLACES,

08:44.625 --> 08:46.560
BUT WHAT GOOD
DOES IT DO, PAUL?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.495
I'M SERIOUS.
I'M NOT BEING CYNICAL.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.463
WHAT GOOD DOES
IT DO ME TODAY

08:50.564 --> 08:52.866
TO KNOW HOW MUCH
I SUFFERED THEN?

08:52.966 --> 08:56.103
I'M SICK OF FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.572
( sighs )

09:00.373 --> 09:04.544
I FUCKING HATE FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF. THAT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS I HATE.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.281
- WHAT ELSE DO YOU HATE?
- THERE'S A LONG LIST.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.718
WELL, FOR EXAMPLE.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.091
- OMELETS.
- OMELETS.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.494
OMELETS AND ALL SORT OF EGGS,
BUT MOSTLY OMELETS.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.797
THAT'S WAS THE THING
MY FATHER AND I ATE

09:23.897 --> 09:26.867
THE ENTIRE YEAR AFTER
MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY.

09:30.938 --> 09:34.007
I STILL HAVE FLASHBACKS,
BUT FROM BEHIND, YOU KNOW?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.777
I'M STANDING
AT THE STOVE

09:36.877 --> 09:39.813
AND I'M BREAKING EGGS
INTO A FRYING PAN.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.949
EVERYTHING'S VERY QUIET,
NO TALKING.

09:42.049 --> 09:44.818
MY DAD'S JUST
SITTING THERE

09:44.918 --> 09:48.521
READING THE NEWSPAPER
OR SOMETHING AND
I'M JUST...

09:48.622 --> 09:52.125
BEATING THE EGGS
WITH A FORK.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.262
SOMETIMES HE WOULDN'T
EVEN BE READING
THE NEWSPAPER.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.898
HE WOULD JUST BE
SITTING THERE

09:57.998 --> 10:00.600
WITH A VACANT LOOK,
IN A DAZE.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.138
I USED TO--

10:09.142 --> 10:13.346
I'D FANTASIZE THAT
HE'D DISAPPEAR.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.349
SUCH A TERRIBLE THING
TO SAY. IT'S NOT THAT
I WANTED HIM TO DIE.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.653
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO
CONTINUE LIVING LIKE THAT.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.889
EVERYTHING WAS SO BLEAK,
SO SUFFOCATING.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.857
I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THERE.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.260
SO THEN...

10:27.360 --> 10:28.896
THEN YOU WENT
TO CALIFORNIA.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.931
YEAH.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.200
SO YOU STAYED THERE
FOR A WHILE.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.403
HOW WAS IT COMING BACK HOME
AFTER SPENDING THAT TIME

10:36.503 --> 10:38.706
WITH DAVID AND CELIA?

10:38.806 --> 10:42.710
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE PLANS,

10:42.810 --> 10:44.377
FULL OF BEANS.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.047
I THOUGHT,
"SHIT, I CAN MAKE HIM
FEEL BETTER. I CAN."

10:47.147 --> 10:48.849
BUT I COULDN'T.

10:48.949 --> 10:52.820
THAT HOUSE WAS LIKE
A BLACK HOLE THAT
JUST SUCKED ME IN.

10:56.556 --> 11:00.593
ANYWAY,
I SAW DAVID AGAIN

11:00.694 --> 11:02.129
SIX MONTHS LATER.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.530
OH?

11:03.630 --> 11:06.233
YEAH, HE CAME
TO THE D.C. AREA

11:06.333 --> 11:08.235
TO TRY SOME BIG CASE.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.638
HE WAS STAYED FOR A WHILE,
A FEW MONTHS.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.674
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.447
WELL, I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN,
BUT I SAW HIM.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.153
HE USED TO HAVE A ROOM
AT THE HAY-ADAMS,

11:26.253 --> 11:28.188
BUT OCCASIONALLY,

11:28.288 --> 11:31.892
HE'D, YOU KNOW,
STAY OVER AT OUR HOUSE.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.362
HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR,
SO WHEN IT GOT LATE
HE'D STAY.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.866
HE ALWAYS OFFERED
TO TAKE A CAB BACK
INTO TOWN,

11:38.966 --> 11:41.501
BUT MY DAD REFUSED

11:41.601 --> 11:45.538
SINCE HE WAS
SO HOSPITABLE TO ME

11:45.638 --> 11:48.475
DURING THE SUMMER.

11:48.575 --> 11:50.744
I MEAN, HE WAS LONELY.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.882
BUT HE WASN'T
THE SAME DAVID,
YOU KNOW,

11:54.982 --> 11:57.350
WITH THE RAY-BANS
AND THE SUNBLOCK
AND THE SURFBOARD.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.787
HE WAS THIS LAWYER GUY

11:59.887 --> 12:02.222
WITH A THREE-PIECE SUIT,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.024
AN EXPENSIVE HAIRCUT

12:04.124 --> 12:07.828
AND A MIDDLE-AGED
POT BELLY--

12:09.429 --> 12:12.766
NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING
WRONG WITH A POT BELLY.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.273
ANYWAY, HE CAME
TO OUR HOUSE

12:20.373 --> 12:22.843
FOR DINNER THE FIRST NIGHT
HE WAS IN TOWN.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.112
MY BROTHER OLIVER
WAS AWAY AT COLLEGE

12:25.212 --> 12:28.281
AND SO IT WAS JUST
THE THREE OF US--

12:28.381 --> 12:30.350
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY,

12:30.450 --> 12:33.954
MY DAD, DAVID AND I.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.289
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE,
SITTING THERE

12:36.389 --> 12:38.758
WITH THESE EXTREMES,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.428
YOUR FATHER
ON ONE SIDE AND...

12:41.528 --> 12:45.132
NICK NOLTE
WITH A POT BELLY
SITTING ON THE OTHER SIDE?

12:45.232 --> 12:47.134
- WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?
- AT FIRST,

12:47.234 --> 12:50.003
WELL, SELF-CONSCIOUS,
I GUESS.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.673
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS
FEEL MORE LIKE A KID

12:53.773 --> 12:56.543
WHEN YOUR PARENTS ARE
AROUND? THAT HAPPENED.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.315
I REMEMBER
SLURPING UP SPAGHETTI

13:02.415 --> 13:05.785
AND TRYING REALLY HARD
NOT TO LET THE NOODLES
DRIP DOWN MY CHIN.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.390
LATER, I GUESS,

13:10.490 --> 13:13.093
I WASN'T AS SELF-CONSCIOUS.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.829
OH, WHY?

13:20.567 --> 13:23.803
LATER, AFTER DAVID
AND I MADE LOVE.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.144
I SEDUCED HIM.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.218
- HAVE YOU READ "LOLITA"?
- SURE.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.786
IT'S AMAZING,

13:39.887 --> 13:42.856
BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME THING
HAPPENED TO ME.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.831
THAT NIGHT WHEN HE
CAME OVER FOR DINNER,

13:51.932 --> 13:54.101
MY DAD WAS STILL
AT WORK.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.905
SO WE SAT
ON THE PORCH AND,

13:59.372 --> 14:01.942
YOU KNOW, CAUGHT UP.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.545
I WAS PAINTING
MY TOENAILS.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.680
AND IT BECAME
PRETTY CLEAR

14:07.780 --> 14:09.582
THAT HE AND CELIA
WERE HAVING PROBLEMS,

14:09.682 --> 14:13.553
I MEAN, HE SAID JUST AS MUCH,
WHICH IS WHY SHE HADN'T
JOINED HIM ON THE TRIP.

14:16.256 --> 14:20.160
SO WE WERE JUST SITTING
ON THE PORCH SWING.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.997
I WAS ON ONE SIDE.
HE WAS ON THE OTHER.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.400
AND I WAS RESTING
MY LEGS

14:27.500 --> 14:30.270
ON HIS TO DRY MY NAILS.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.540
AND HE WAS JUST ASKING
ABOUT ME,

14:33.640 --> 14:36.009
WHAT WAS GOING ON
WITH ME,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.946
AND I STARTED TELLING
HIM ABOUT THE RED HOT
CHILI PEPPERS.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.814
GOD, I WAS SO INTO THEM.

14:41.915 --> 14:44.284
YOU KNOW, HOW YOU'RE
AT THAT STAGE WHERE
YOU'RE WRITING DOWN THE LYRICS

14:44.384 --> 14:45.452
AND ANALYZING THEM,

14:45.552 --> 14:48.321
AND I STARTED SINGING
AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.590
( singing )

14:52.225 --> 14:54.261
AND DAVID JOINED IN,
AND WE WERE SO BAD.

14:54.361 --> 14:57.030
I MEAN, WE WERE
SCREAMING IT.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.970
AND THEN I FELT
HIS HARDNESS

15:03.070 --> 15:05.305
UNDER MY FOOT.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.977
AND WE WE'RE JUST ROCKING
IN THE SWING

15:10.077 --> 15:12.379
AND THE RHYTHM OF IT
STARTS TO TAKE OVER.

15:13.846 --> 15:17.050
AND I'M JUST RUBBING HIM
WITH MY FOOT,

15:17.150 --> 15:19.919
ALTHOUGH I'VE NEVER DONE
THAT BEFORE IN MY LIFE--
NEVER NEVER.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.225
I HAD ON THIS LITTLE SKIRT
WITH THESE LITTLE FLOWERS.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.927
AND HE PUSHED UP MY SKIRT
WITH HIS FINGER.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.200
AND HIS FINGER
JUST STARTED

15:33.300 --> 15:36.669
CLIMBING FURTHER
AND FURTHER UP MY THIGH.

15:38.405 --> 15:42.075
THEN WE SEE MY
FATHER'S VOLVO COMING
DOWN THE STREET,

15:42.175 --> 15:45.845
SO WE RAN OVER TO HELP HIM
WITH THE GROCERIES.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.982
AND I REMEMBER LAUGHING
SO HARD BECAUSE DAVID WAS
CARRYING HIS BAG OF GROCERIES

15:49.082 --> 15:51.051
IN FRONT OF HIS HARD-ON.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.587
WE WERE JUST CRACKING UP
LIKE TEENAGERS.

15:57.524 --> 16:01.894
HE STAYED OVER THAT NIGHT
IN OLIVER'S ROOM.

16:01.995 --> 16:05.065
AND AROUND 1:00 IN
THE MORNING, I GOT UP
'CAUSE I COULDN'T SLEEP,

16:05.165 --> 16:08.535
AND I WALKED
DOWN THE CORRIDOR
IN THE HOUSE.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.103
OLIVER'S ROOM WAS
AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

16:10.203 --> 16:13.440
AND I SAW
HIS LIGHT ON

16:13.540 --> 16:15.175
AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN,

16:15.275 --> 16:18.478
AND HE WAS WAITING FOR ME.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.713
DAVID.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.486
AND WE MADE LOVE.
IT WAS LOVELY.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.688
AND DURING THE TWO MONTHS
THAT HE WAS IN TOWN,

16:28.788 --> 16:31.058
WE MADE LOVE ALMOST EVERY DAY,
MOSTLY IN THE MORNINGS

16:31.158 --> 16:33.560
WHEN MY DAD WENT TO WORK,
BUT OCCASIONALLY,

16:33.660 --> 16:35.762
IF HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
IN COURT UNTIL THE AFTERNOON,

16:35.862 --> 16:39.366
I'D PLAY HOOKY.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.202
SOMETIMES I'D GO
TO HIS FANCY HOTEL.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.073
I FELT VERY IMPORTANT
AND GROWN-UP

16:46.173 --> 16:49.742
WALKING THROUGH THAT LOBBY
IN MY MOTHER'S HIGH HEELS.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.452
HMM.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.856
DID YOU EVER FEEL
THAT THIS MAN,

17:03.956 --> 17:07.727
THAT DAVID WAS TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF YOU?

17:07.827 --> 17:10.197
HE WASN'T TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF ME.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.365
I'M TELLING YOU.
I SEDUCED HIM.

17:12.465 --> 17:16.836
WELL, LOLITA SEDUCES
HUMBERT HUMBERT
IN THE NOVEL

17:16.936 --> 17:18.371
AND SHE'S ONLY 12.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.708
WELL, YOU DISAPPROVE,
OBVIOUSLY.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.810
YES, I DO.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.579
WHAT'S THE MATTER, PAUL?
YOU'RE MAKING A JUDGMENT
ON ME.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.282
YOU'RE ALLOWING YOURSELF
TO STRAY FROM THE RULES.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.354
GOSH, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU WEREN'T LIKE
THIS BEFORE,

17:34.454 --> 17:36.256
WILLING TO SAY WHAT'S
ON YOUR MIND.

17:36.356 --> 17:39.359
WELL, YOU NEVER
TOLD ME THIS BEFORE.

17:41.194 --> 17:44.697
IT'S OUR LAST SESSION
SO I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY
RIGHT YOU TO TELL YOU.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.368
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU
THAT THE GUY

17:48.468 --> 17:50.803
FROM DEBATE SOCIETY
WAS MY FIRST?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.972
YES.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.143
WELL, DAVID WAS MY FIRST.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.813
AND I'M SORRY.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.684
AND WHAT ARE YOU
SORRY FOR?

18:04.784 --> 18:07.454
FOR LYING TO YOU.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.128
I WASN'T A VICTIM, PAUL.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.929
DON'T LOOK
AT ME LIKE THAT.
I WASN'T A VICTIM.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.166
- REALLY?
- I GOT INTO HIS BED.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.635
HE WAS A 40-YEAR-OLD MAN,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

18:24.237 --> 18:27.039
HE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY
TO SEND YOU AWAY.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.976
HE WAS VERY GENTLE.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.312
WHETHER HE WAS
GENTLE OR NOT IS
BESIDE THE POINT.

18:32.412 --> 18:35.182
HE WAS 40 YEARS OLD.
HE HAD A MORAL
RESPONSIBILITY.

18:35.282 --> 18:37.884
HE SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN BETTER.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.587
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.623
DO YOU FEEL...

18:43.723 --> 18:46.459
DO YOU FEEL ANY ANGER
TOWARDS THIS MAN,
TOWARDS DAVID?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.929
LOOK, PAUL,
IT'S NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.932
HE DIDN'T HURT ME.
IT DIDN'T HURT AT ALL.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.334
IT WASN'T RAPE.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.804
WHERE WAS YOUR FATHER
DURING ALL THIS?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.641
HE WAS ASLEEP
IN THE NEXT ROOM.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.877
YES, BUT DURING
THE TWO MONTHS
THAT DAVID WAS...

19:04.977 --> 19:06.413
VISITING,

19:06.513 --> 19:08.848
YOUR FATHER HAD
NO IDEA WHAT
WAS GOING ON?

19:08.948 --> 19:12.285
HE WAS DEPRESSED
AND GRIEVING.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.122
IT HADN'T EVEN BEEN A YEAR
SINCE MY MOTHER PASSED AWAY.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.191
HE NEEDED SOMEONE
TO PROTECT HIM,
AND GUESS WHO?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.892
YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.962
BUT CHILDREN AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE
OF THEIR PARENTS, LAURA.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.799
IT'S A BURDEN THAT
NO CHILD DESERVES.

19:28.201 --> 19:30.870
DO YOU FEEL ANY ANGER
TOWARDS YOUR FATHER

19:30.970 --> 19:34.040
FOR NOT BEING THERE

19:34.140 --> 19:37.510
TO PROTECT YOU,
FOR NOT NOTICING?

19:40.146 --> 19:42.181
NO RESENTMENT?

19:45.918 --> 19:49.021
LET'S JUST SAY YOU COULD
TALK TO YOUR FATHER NOW.

19:49.121 --> 19:50.390
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO HIM?

19:50.490 --> 19:53.460
I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HIM.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.363
BUT JUST IMAGINE
FOR A MOMENT IF YOU
WERE FACE TO FACE

19:56.463 --> 19:59.632
AND YOU WERE TALKING

19:59.732 --> 20:02.269
ABOUT THIS INCIDENT.

20:02.369 --> 20:04.604
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT SAY TO HIM?

20:04.704 --> 20:08.140
- HAVE YOU EVER SPOKEN
TO YOUR FATHER IN THAT WAY?
- I WISH I COULD.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.644
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TALK
TO YOUR FATHER, YOU'RE
ASKING ME TO TALK TO MINE?

20:11.744 --> 20:13.513
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING, LAURA.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.383
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TALK

20:16.483 --> 20:19.786
TO YOUR FATHER
ABOUT THIS

20:19.886 --> 20:20.987
WHILE IT'S STILL
POSSIBLE,

20:21.087 --> 20:24.757
NOT FOR HIS SAKE,

20:24.857 --> 20:27.159
BUT FOR YOURS.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.729
YEAH?

20:30.930 --> 20:34.934
CAN I HAVE SOMETHING
TO DRINK OTHER THAN WATER?

20:35.034 --> 20:38.705
- SURE.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY SODA?

20:41.274 --> 20:43.476
I DON'T KNOW.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.047
SO THIS IS THE FAMOUS
COFFEE MACHINE, HUH?

20:48.147 --> 20:50.417
ALEX'S FAMOUS
COFFEE MACHINE, YEAH.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.819
HOW DO YOU USE IT?

20:56.188 --> 20:57.857
EXCUSE ME.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.665
- HE'S SUCH
A COFFEE FREAK-- ALEX.
- UH-HUH.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.603
IT'S THE BEST SMELL,
DON'T YOU THINK?
( sniffs )

21:19.746 --> 21:22.682
YOU KNOW THAT THIS THING
WITH ME AND ALEX IS OVER.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.818
I ENDED IT.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.357
ARE YOU RELIEVED?

21:35.962 --> 21:38.531
JESUS, PAUL,
LOOK AT YOU.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.401
HOW CAN YOU
LIVE LIKE THIS?

21:41.501 --> 21:45.372
CAN'T YOU JUST SAY
OR DO SOMETHING
ON IMPULSE?

21:57.283 --> 22:00.753
YOU KNOW THAT I
CONNECTED THAT GIRL
TO THE WRONG TUBE.

22:04.857 --> 22:08.194
I INFLATED HER
LIKE A BALLOON.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.663
AND I ALMOST KILLED HER,
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

22:14.367 --> 22:16.736
BECAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.442
AND I REALIZED
WHAT AN INSANE EFFECT
YOU'RE HAVING ON ME.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.713
IT HAS TO STOP.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.689
LAURA, LAURA,

22:36.789 --> 22:38.691
WE CAN CONTINUE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS
IF YOU WANT.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.794
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS
WITH YOUR TIME.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.201
YOU KNOW, FOR MONTHS
I SPENT THE WEEK THINKING,

22:49.301 --> 22:51.804
"IT'LL BE THIS MONDAY.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.874
I'LL TELL HIM THAT
I LOVE HIM AND HE'LL
TELL ME HE LOVES ME,

22:54.974 --> 22:58.811
AND THE SESSION
WON'T BE 50 MINUTES.
IT'LL GO FOREVER.

23:02.849 --> 23:07.386
BUT THEN MONDAY WOULD
COME AND I WOULDN'T
DARE SAY ANYTHING.

23:07.487 --> 23:11.157
AND THE SESSION WOULD END
AND I WOULD JUST WALK OUT
OF HERE THINKING,

23:11.257 --> 23:13.359
"FUCK!

23:13.460 --> 23:16.128
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING AGAIN.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.632
NOW I HAVE TO WAIT
A WHOLE OTHER WEEK

23:19.732 --> 23:22.134
FOR MY LIFE TO BEGIN."

23:27.206 --> 23:30.577
I CAN'T CONTINUE, PAUL.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.845
EVERY MINUTE HERE
IS TEARING ME APART.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.608
( theme music playing )
