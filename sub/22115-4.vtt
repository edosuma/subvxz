00:02.936 --> 00:04.338
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.207
Welcome to Sophe.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.309
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.578
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.611 --> 00:12.213
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:12.246 --> 00:13.647
or to tear us apart.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.083
I know because I spent my life

00:15.849 --> 00:17.151
trying to turn it
into something

00:18.152 --> 00:19.253
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:20.321 --> 00:22.090
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.191
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.626
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:25.659 --> 00:27.061
the police, my ex-wife--

00:28.362 --> 00:30.098
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:30.131 --> 00:31.399
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.333
So, together with my team,

00:33.601 --> 00:34.668
I built Sophe, a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.702 --> 00:38.172
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:38.206 --> 00:41.075
independent collection
of detectives on the planet:

00:41.109 --> 00:43.377
you.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.378
Let's get to work.

00:46.214 --> 00:48.182
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:48.216 --> 00:49.483
Next week is
the one-year anniversary

00:49.517 --> 00:50.551
of my daughter Mia's death.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.153
Ryan Booth.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.554
This is a drug addict

00:53.587 --> 00:55.289
with a violent criminal record

00:55.323 --> 00:57.125
caught on camera
assaulting our daughter.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.560
And I am gonna find him.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.195
My dad took out
a second mortgage

01:01.229 --> 01:03.197
just to send him to Grand Pines,

01:03.231 --> 01:05.199
some fancy
treatment center.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.169
Mia wasn't an intern
at Grand Pines.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.238
She was a patient.
She was a what?

01:10.271 --> 01:11.639
If the brass catch on
that you're helping

01:11.672 --> 01:13.707
Jeffrey Tanner undermine
a closed murder case...

01:13.741 --> 01:15.543
Your closed murder case.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.477
Where do we start?

01:16.510 --> 01:18.546
Lieutenant Ruiz,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.214
glad you finally figured out
that we can help.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.382
You knew, didn't you?

01:21.415 --> 01:22.616
Knew what?

01:22.650 --> 01:23.717
About Mia's stay at Grand Pines.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.386
Why didn't you tell me?

01:25.419 --> 01:26.587
She didn't want you to know.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.888
Jeffrey's been wrong
about all this, right?

01:27.921 --> 01:29.690
You've been divorced nine years.
You don't owe him anything.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.360
Carlos Ochoa, he did not
kill our daughter.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.128
You should've just kept your
mouth shut about that girl.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.529
What if we never find him?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.298
SARA:
The tech works.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.499
An hour ago,
we just pulled a serial killer

01:38.532 --> 01:39.633
off the street.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.702
We're gonna find
the truth about Mia.

01:44.272 --> 01:46.174
CROWD (chanting):
You will not replace us!

01:46.207 --> 01:48.309
You will not replace us!

01:48.342 --> 01:50.278
You will not replace us!

01:50.311 --> 01:53.214
You will not replace us!
You will not replace us!

01:53.247 --> 01:55.516
(chanting):
Say it loud, say it clear!

01:55.549 --> 01:57.718
Immigrants are welcome here!

01:57.751 --> 01:59.620
America is white!
(crowd cheering)

01:59.653 --> 02:02.490
America is ours!

02:02.523 --> 02:04.358
(crowd cheering)

02:04.392 --> 02:06.527
(chanting): All of us!
America for all of us!

02:06.560 --> 02:08.629
All of us! All of us!

02:08.662 --> 02:11.165
Because this is
our great struggle,

02:11.199 --> 02:13.367
the struggle of white,

02:13.401 --> 02:17.338
European Americans who
made this country great.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.472
(crowd cheering)

02:18.506 --> 02:22.310
(crowd clamoring)

02:22.343 --> 02:24.278
We have awoken

02:24.312 --> 02:28.382
and we will not go quietly!

02:28.416 --> 02:29.517
(crowd clamoring)

02:31.252 --> 02:33.153
(glass shatters)

02:34.288 --> 02:35.789
(tear gas guns popping)

02:35.823 --> 02:38.292
NEWSWOMAN: A political protest
turned violent

02:38.326 --> 02:40.628
last night when
white nationalist demonstrators,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.430
participating in a rally

02:42.463 --> 02:45.233
against San Francisco's
sanctuary city policies,

02:45.266 --> 02:48.202
clashed with
anti-racist activists

02:48.236 --> 02:50.404
in Jefferson Park
near city hall.

02:50.438 --> 02:52.406
The rally was organized by

02:52.440 --> 02:54.642
white nationalist leader
Brandt Davis,

02:54.675 --> 02:58.412
a self-proclaimed spokesman
for the alt-right.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.781
The Take Back Our Cities rally
has been in the works

03:00.814 --> 03:04.352
for several weeks, and was to
feature a number of national...

03:04.385 --> 03:06.287
Would you like some?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.421
Want some bread?

03:07.455 --> 03:09.790
Oh, brilliant.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.361
Thank you.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.695
Where did you get this?

03:14.728 --> 03:18.566
(chuckles) It's not
our first rodeo, dear.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.234
CAVANAUGH:
That one.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.606
Morning, sister.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.808
Pleasure as always,
Detective.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.582
SARA:
Vandalism?

03:34.615 --> 03:36.850
I went to protest
neo-Nazis, not burn cars.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.586
I was trying to stop people
from breaking windows.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.321
I'm sure you were, but, uh...

03:40.354 --> 03:41.722
Look, Detective, I didn't
do anything wrong,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.691
and I'm waiting for my
green card to be approved.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.693
If I get charged,
I will be deported.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.829
And here I thought
irony was dead.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.332
And why am I not
surprised to see you?

03:51.365 --> 03:52.500
Sure, just hang around my desk.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.501
You okay?

03:53.534 --> 03:54.735
Yeah, I'm fine, honestly.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.370
I even made a few new friends.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.339
Some friends, really?
Yes.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.374
Yeah, the nuns
are easy to talk to.

04:00.408 --> 04:04.278
I asked Sophe users for help,
and they uploaded this.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.615
SARA:
Stop! Stop!

04:07.648 --> 04:09.483
Stop! What are you doing?!

04:09.517 --> 04:10.818
This is a peaceful protest!

04:10.851 --> 04:12.486
MAN:
Let go!

04:12.520 --> 04:13.721
SARA:
Get off!

04:13.754 --> 04:14.888
POLICE OFFICER:
Drop the weapon!

04:14.922 --> 04:17.491
Drop it! Turn around.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.327
Hands on the wall.
It's not mine.
That-that wasn't mine.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.762
Now!
Okay, yup.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
If they haven't charged her yet,
they're not going to,

04:23.864 --> 04:26.300
not after they see this.

04:26.334 --> 04:27.301
You're enjoying this.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.602
I am very much so.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.637
RUIZ:
Body just turned up.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.838
Near Jefferson Square Park.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.473
Fun never stops.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.741
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.744
You can go home now.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.845
TANNER:
They let you keep the handcuffs?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.613
There you go.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.582
CROWD (chanting):
All of us! All of us!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.484
(siren wailing)
All of us!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.786
All of us! All of us!

04:45.819 --> 04:47.455
So what do we got,
a dead protestor?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.523
Notprotestor,

04:49.557 --> 04:51.625
the protestor.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.727
Whoa, is that...?
Yes.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.365
That is Brandt Davis.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.533
A dead white supremacist
in downtown San Francisco.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.802
You don't see
that every day.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.537
White nationalist,

05:03.571 --> 05:04.672
I believe is what they're
calling themselves now.

05:04.705 --> 05:05.806
Oh, yeah. That makes it better.

05:05.839 --> 05:06.874
Yeah.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.542
Body's been here all night?

05:08.576 --> 05:09.943
Homeless man found him.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.645
Two gunshot wounds,
close range.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.547
No weapons, no casings.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.948
Picture perfect.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.784
All right, let's rewind.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.752
Davis was the keynote
speaker last night.

05:18.786 --> 05:19.953
Protestors came,

05:19.987 --> 05:21.555
call it hate speech...

05:21.589 --> 05:23.524
Well, he wasn't exactly
singing "Kumbaya."

05:23.557 --> 05:25.393
Then all hell broke loose.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.695
So, he gets chased
from the rally and comes here,

05:27.728 --> 05:29.430
three blocks away, to get shot.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.665
Question is: by whom?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.967
Well, isn't the simplest answer
usually the right one?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.504
I mean, there were thousands
of people here last night.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.905
A lot of them were mad at him.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.973
Any one of them
could've done this.
WOMAN: Brandt!

05:40.007 --> 05:41.809
(crying):
Let me through, please!
Get your hands off her.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.411
That's his wife.
(crying):
Please.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.445
CAVANAUGH:
Hey, it's okay.

05:44.478 --> 05:44.878
It's okay. Let them through.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.816
No...
I want to see him, please.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.418
Mrs. Davis, you can't touch
the body right now.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.719
We're still gathering evidence.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.821
(crying): He should've
had more protection.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.423
Mrs. Davis, we'd like to ask
you some questions downtown.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.458
Why?

05:57.491 --> 05:59.727
You're telling me you two intend
to take this case seriously?

05:59.760 --> 06:00.761
And you are?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.530
Caleb Boorman.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.998
Brandt and I
built this movement together.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.735
I promise you, Mr. Boorman, when
it comes to solving a murder,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.438
only color I see is blue.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.806
Mrs. Davis, we want to find out
who did this to your husband,

06:12.840 --> 06:14.508
and we need your help
for that, so, please.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.610
Okay.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.579
(crying)

06:18.612 --> 06:19.947
(siren wailing)

06:21.849 --> 06:23.584
Did you call her?

06:23.617 --> 06:24.885
No.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.788
Watch your step, ma'am.

06:29.657 --> 06:30.658
Deputy Chief.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.862
Well, I guess the rest
of my week just blew up.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.765
These nutjobs are
already armed and angry.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.999
How do you think
they'll react

06:39.032 --> 06:40.768
to their hater-in-chief
being killed?

06:40.801 --> 06:42.870
I will pull as many
detectives as I can.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.640
What about your
buddy, Tanner?

06:46.674 --> 06:49.477
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call him my buddy.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.480
But, uh, his people have
helped us out on a few cases.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.681
You've helped him out, too.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.651
You slipped him police files
on Ryan Booth, didn't you?

06:57.685 --> 06:59.920
Now he needs
to help us.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.022
I want you to formalize
a relationship with him.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.691
Ma'am, all due respect...

07:03.724 --> 07:06.660
This Sophe, it closes cases.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.028
And given all the attention
on this one,

07:08.061 --> 07:09.930
I'll take all the help
I can get.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.064
Plus, people are
talking about it.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.065
It's good PR.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.734
PR?
Yes.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.769
It's a whole new era
of civic engagement.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.838
I want people to know that SFPD

07:17.871 --> 07:19.840
is working with Sophe
on a regular basis.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.810
You want me to get Tanner
to work with us?

07:22.843 --> 07:25.479
His daughter's murder is
the only thing he cares about,

07:25.513 --> 07:26.780
and he's convinced
we got the wrong man.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.081
Which we didn't.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.818
Fine. Tanner agrees,

07:30.851 --> 07:32.953
you can help him with
his investigation.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.922
Unofficially, of course.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.857
Chief.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.592
What do you mean,
"unofficially"?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.027
We'll work out
the details later.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.563
Just get Tanner on board
and solve this

07:42.596 --> 07:44.632
before the whole city
becomes a riot zone.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.841
Well, tell your boss
if she wants a deal,

07:53.874 --> 07:56.977
she's gonna have to officially
reopen my daughter's case.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.078
CAVANAUGH:
You know I can't do that.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.948
But what I can do
is help you now

08:00.981 --> 08:02.783
without having to sneak around
about it.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.018
Sounds like they were
already onto you about that.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.654
What about Mia's case files?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.121
I want access to all of them.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.658
That should be fine.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.726
And if we find new leads,
you'll run them down,

08:12.760 --> 08:13.927
just like you would
any other case?

08:13.961 --> 08:15.696
When time permits, yes.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.997
Best I can do.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.732
Oh, by the way,
there's one more thing.

08:18.766 --> 08:19.967
Yeah.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.735
Deputy chief said
she'll make sure

08:21.769 --> 08:23.003
there's no charges against Sara.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.773
You can tell her
she's in the clear.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.843
I'll tell her
when I see her.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.845
So, we got a deal or what?

08:31.879 --> 08:34.748
(sighs) Okay.

08:34.782 --> 08:35.749
What's the case?

08:35.783 --> 08:39.620
Yeah. About that.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.922
*

08:49.963 --> 08:52.700
JOSH: Brandt Davis,
Mr. Alt-Right, the guy is toxic.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.067
Right, he sucks.
So, now what?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.969
We're supposed to kill
people we disagree with?

08:56.003 --> 08:57.771
No, I didn't say that.
You know, there's definitely

08:57.805 --> 08:58.672
a picture of you
in the dictionary

08:58.706 --> 08:59.840
right next to "broflake."

08:59.873 --> 09:01.041
What does that even mean?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.676
What I'm worried about
is selling out

09:02.710 --> 09:03.777
so the cops run this place.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.880
Nobody runs
this place but us.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.082
Now, we'll work with the SFPD
on a case-by-case basis

09:09.116 --> 09:12.052
for as long as it benefits
Mia's investigation.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.787
Understood?

09:13.821 --> 09:14.988
Now, this case
is an opportunity.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.925
To do what exactly?

09:17.958 --> 09:21.061
To see how Sophe
handles user bias.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.763
They've done
experiments on this.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.998
When a football game
has too many penalties,

09:25.032 --> 09:27.701
the fans on each team think
that the other team committed

09:27.735 --> 09:29.737
twice as many...
JOSH:
Selective perception.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
It's like the fans are seeing
two completely different games.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.841
Which is a perfect metaphor
for the country right now.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.709
(phone vibrates)
Let's play this video.

09:35.743 --> 09:41.114
Brandt Davis posted this
just before he was killed.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.217
Tonight we unmask our
adversaries for who they are:

09:44.251 --> 09:48.689
hypocrites who claim
to stand for free speech

09:48.722 --> 09:51.725
while attacking us for
expressing our point of view.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.694
We're still here.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.696
And we're ready to fight
for this cause,

09:55.729 --> 09:59.232
ready to die for it,
and we will prevail,

09:59.266 --> 10:03.003
because when truth is on
your side, nothing else matters.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.838
Seriously?

10:04.872 --> 10:07.107
This is not about free speech.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.643
They went there
looking for violence.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.646
They were itching for it
just so they can play the victim

10:12.680 --> 10:14.882
and argue that both sides
are to blame. No, I'm sorry.

10:14.915 --> 10:18.786
There's a right and there's
a wrong, and racists are wrong.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.253
We have every right
to stand up to them

10:20.287 --> 10:22.756
and tell them exactly
how pathetic they are.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.725
TANNER:
That's exactly my point.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.760
He's a polarizing victim
who has divided the country

10:26.794 --> 10:27.995
and possibly our user base.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.197
If we can't
filter out the bias

10:30.230 --> 10:31.965
and extract what the
crowd actually thinks,

10:31.999 --> 10:33.734
Sophe doesn't work.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.135
Jeffrey.
One second, Mike.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
Sophe lives or dies on this.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.639
Put it up.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.177
JOSH:
How are we gonna solve a murder

10:44.211 --> 10:46.880
when so many of our own users
don't even want to help?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.215
Have you not been
listening to me?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.017
That's exactly
what I'm saying.
MIKE: Alex.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.027
You knew that Mia wanted
to keep this private.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.028
I told you that.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.696
Where'd you get this?

11:02.730 --> 11:03.897
My chief of staff.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.700
The press called.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.267
They want a comment from me

11:08.168 --> 11:09.102
because they're gonna
run this story.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.170
All right, listen.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.774
I swear to you
that I did not post

11:13.807 --> 11:15.175
anything about
Grand Pines on Sophe.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.744
Then who did?

11:16.777 --> 11:17.911
(computer beeping)

11:20.013 --> 11:22.983
Where did they find this?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.322
ALEX: You did this when
you posted her case online.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.824
You did this!
I didn't do this!

11:30.858 --> 11:32.793
Yes, you did!

11:32.826 --> 11:34.294
Our daughter
has become clickbait.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.796
That's not-- Alex.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.064
You need to fix this.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.932
Use your connections,
use your money.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.100
I don't care
what you do,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.902
but you need to fix it.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.017
RUIZ: Mrs. Davis,
I know this is hard for you,

11:58.285 --> 11:59.386
but I need you to tell me what
you remember from last night.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.389
Honestly, not much.

12:02.422 --> 12:06.126
When the barricades broke,
it was chaos.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.396
Do you remember where you were
exactly when it happened?

12:09.429 --> 12:12.532
No. I just remember
being attacked.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.269
I lost Brandt in the crowd.
We got separated.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.405
Everyone scattered.

12:18.438 --> 12:22.075
After that,
I just ran to the hotel.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.111
But he wasn't there.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.414
I... I waited for him
all night, but...

12:27.447 --> 12:29.449
(sniffles)

12:29.482 --> 12:31.284
Being a public figure,

12:31.318 --> 12:33.453
I'm sure your husband received
his share of threats.

12:33.486 --> 12:37.190
Are there any in particular
that you can tell us about?

12:37.224 --> 12:37.958
BOORMAN: You're
kidding me, right?

12:38.992 --> 12:39.526
Brandt got threats
from everyone.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.062
Everywhere.
Last week in Austin,

12:42.095 --> 12:45.032
some "bad hombre"
punched him in the jaw.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.433
Cops practically cheered.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.068
LILIANA:
Well, Brandt was, uh...

12:50.470 --> 12:54.374
He had views that
a lot of people didn't like.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.143
He...

12:58.245 --> 13:01.114
Do you know
what it feels like to

13:01.148 --> 13:03.216
fall in love
with somebody,

13:03.250 --> 13:06.486
and then you look up one day
and they're a different person?

13:06.519 --> 13:10.557
I know some of the things
he said were offensive,

13:10.590 --> 13:14.327
but no one is just one thing,
and Brandt was a good person.

13:14.361 --> 13:17.197
He taught me to
never apologize for who I was.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.266
BOORMAN:
He was a truth teller.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.134
That's why people hated him.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.471
I'm sorry, what truth

13:24.504 --> 13:26.306
was he telling?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.541
That race is what defines us
as human beings.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.511
Government,
economics, religion--

13:31.544 --> 13:34.214
they're all just constructs that
obscure the fundamental fact

13:34.247 --> 13:36.483
that human life is
a competition between races.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.118
Oh, please.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.386
And where are your people
from exactly?

13:39.419 --> 13:42.089
You're a white European.
Acknowledge it.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.290
Be proud of it.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.058
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, are we done?

13:45.092 --> 13:47.127
We're here to find out
who killed Mr. Davis,

13:47.160 --> 13:49.029
not to have a damn
political debate.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.231
You think I believe that?

13:51.264 --> 13:53.466
In the People's Republic
of San Francisco?

13:53.500 --> 13:55.068
Give me a break.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.636
Then try us.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.239
Tell your followers
to send us

13:59.272 --> 14:01.074
any information they
have about the rally.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.243
Put it on Sophe.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.412
If it's real, we'll post it.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.583
Done.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.522
We'll be watching.

14:19.559 --> 14:20.560
(door opens)

14:20.593 --> 14:22.529
(clears throat)

14:22.562 --> 14:24.231
(door closes)

14:24.264 --> 14:27.567
How does that not
make you insane?

14:27.600 --> 14:29.602
You think I haven't
heard that before?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.471
Or worse?

14:31.504 --> 14:35.108
I heard just as bad
in the locker room at work.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.345
Right.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.380
Sorry.
Guess we all do

14:40.413 --> 14:42.049
live in our little bubbles,
don't we?

14:44.484 --> 14:48.221
So far, 38 separate sites have
carried the Grand Pines story.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.689
Send a cease and desist
to all of them.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.324
I want them taken down.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.425
If you want to
play whack-a-mole,

14:53.426 --> 14:54.227
they're just gonna
pop up somewhere else.

14:54.261 --> 14:54.794
And most of them
are worded carefully

14:54.827 --> 14:57.097
to avoid a libel claim.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.565
This is my daughter,
Mike, all right?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.301
Talk about "fake news"?
This is it.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.702
Dangle a few
defamation suits, will you?

15:02.735 --> 15:05.638
Why? So you can
look like Peter Thiel,

15:05.672 --> 15:07.640
some Silicon Valley bully
who's trying to buy his way

15:07.674 --> 15:08.708
out of the First Amendment?

15:08.741 --> 15:10.477
A) He won,

15:10.510 --> 15:11.311
and B)

15:11.344 --> 15:13.113
the First Amendment
does not apply

15:13.146 --> 15:14.214
if it's false.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.348
It's about the optics, Jeffrey.

15:15.382 --> 15:16.649
The optics?

15:16.683 --> 15:18.385
You're getting slammed
by your own users

15:18.418 --> 15:19.352
because you're trying
to solve the murder

15:19.386 --> 15:20.353
of some white nationalist.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.489
Now you want us to declare
war on the Internet?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.593
Exactly how much ammunition
do you want to hand out?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.495
You know how this works.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.496
In five minutes,
the president's gonna tweet,

15:30.497 --> 15:31.364
and they're gonna be
onto something else.

15:31.398 --> 15:37.204
Just let it go.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.738
You said there are
38 sites, right?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.174
One of them
had to be first.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.710
Find the source.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.582
ALEX: You've interviewed me
plenty of times, Tanya.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.518
I want
your readers to know

15:51.551 --> 15:53.553
who Mia was as a person,

15:53.586 --> 15:55.755
and that the stories
that are out there now,

15:55.788 --> 15:57.657
it's just not the truth.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.194
She was... as you know,

16:01.228 --> 16:06.566
a wonderful, kind, smart,
strong young woman.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.402
She was the light
of my life.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.206
But like a lot of
young people her age,

16:13.240 --> 16:14.607
at one moment in her life,

16:14.641 --> 16:17.277
she suffered from
clinical depression.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.711
It's nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.647
She was very brave.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.550
She sought help for it, and I
was very proud of her for that.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.452
I want to make sure

16:25.485 --> 16:28.321
that people are aware of that
and that they understand that,

16:28.355 --> 16:30.290
because what is
being said right now

16:30.323 --> 16:32.792
is a complete violation
of her privacy.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.395
She kept it private
because she was...

16:35.428 --> 16:37.230
TANYA:
Alex,

16:37.264 --> 16:39.399
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.701
But now that the truth is out,

16:41.734 --> 16:44.737
is it your hope that
these fake stories will stop?

16:44.771 --> 16:48.308
No parent should ever
have to see their child's name

16:48.341 --> 16:49.709
dragged through the mud.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.344
That's right.
That's why we appreciate

16:51.378 --> 16:52.512
the opportunity to
address all this.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.546
Of course.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.482
So, is there anything else
your paper needs?

16:55.515 --> 16:56.649
Okay.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.750
What about Jeffrey?

16:57.784 --> 17:00.787
What about him?

17:00.820 --> 17:01.788
People are saying that,

17:01.821 --> 17:03.656
by launching Sophe,

17:03.690 --> 17:07.427
Jeffrey invited the public
to speculate on Mia's death.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.629
Don't you think he bears
some of the responsibility

17:09.662 --> 17:13.566
for these... lies
that are getting out there?

17:13.600 --> 17:16.403
What my ex-husband does
is his own business.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.670
And I have no comment.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.272
Okay, then.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.308
And I hate to be the one
to show this to you,

17:21.341 --> 17:22.475
but it's out there.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.610
Do you care
to comment on

17:23.643 --> 17:25.712
any of the new rumors that
are circulating right now?

17:25.745 --> 17:26.746
I'm sorry, what new rumors
are you talking about?

17:31.651 --> 17:34.487
Alex Hale is a power player in
D.C. with Silicon Valley money.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.457
And we all know that
the Democrats are desperate

17:37.490 --> 17:39.426
for anybody who can lead them
out of the wilderness,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.394
but not if there are
secrets in her past

17:41.428 --> 17:42.662
that are gonna blow up
in her face.

17:42.695 --> 17:46.466
Now, these are deep waters,
my friends,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.301
and I want to
tread carefully here,

17:48.335 --> 17:49.736
but if her daughter
knew something,

17:49.769 --> 17:51.571
and the Democrats
needed to shut her down...

17:51.604 --> 17:53.673
Ray Randolph?

17:53.706 --> 17:54.674
Seriously, Tanya?

17:55.575 --> 17:56.776
What, you want to talk
about Infowars next?

17:58.077 --> 17:58.478
How about Pizzagate? All right,
you know, we're done here.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.280
We're done.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.449
Carlos Ochoa killed my daughter.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.683
Period.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.785
So you disagree
with your ex-husband?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.624
Yes, I do.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.726
CROWD (chanting):
Stop the white genocide!

18:13.760 --> 18:15.395
You will not replace us!

18:15.428 --> 18:16.863
JOSH: Well, at least
you were wrong about

18:16.896 --> 18:18.698
being an extension
of the police.

18:18.731 --> 18:21.434
Instead, we're being co-opted
by the American Nazi Party.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.370
Who are these idiots?

18:23.403 --> 18:25.305
Look at the tiki torches.
It's like a Nazi luau.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.377
You have anything else?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.779
I've set Sophe to recognize
Brandt Davis's face.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.881
Now she's isolating every image
of him, and we're building

18:34.914 --> 18:37.850
a timeline of his movements
throughout the rally.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.352
TARIQ: There's
Davis setting up.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.520
Now he's taking
the stage.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.791
I need a shower after
reading this stuff.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.659
And a lobotomy
to erase it from my mind.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.761
Okay, wait, slow-slow it down
right there.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.564
That's where Davis gets
separated from his wife.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.335
Stop, stop.
Back up, back up.

18:55.368 --> 18:56.769
There.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.505
That man in the orange.

18:58.538 --> 18:59.606
He's dragging Davis
around the corner.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.341
CAVANAUGH:
Can't see his face.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.642
You got footage
from around the corner?

19:02.675 --> 19:03.676
We're out of video.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.712
Can we load up my footage?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.947
The part that we used
to get me out of jail.
JOSH: Yeah.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.882
Here you go.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.455
SARA:
Hold on, hold on.

19:15.488 --> 19:15.888
There.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.758
Can you zoom in?

19:21.528 --> 19:22.929
TANNER:
Same jacket. It's him.

19:22.962 --> 19:26.433
SARA:
We can't post this.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.701
If we put his face out there,
he'll have a target on his back.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.703
CAVANAUGH:
Normally I'd agree with you,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.372
but the police
do this every day.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.374
I mean, turn on the news,
go to our website.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.576
"Person of interest,
wanted for questioning."

19:36.609 --> 19:38.645
You're the one always
warning us about privacy.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.413
Sara, we got this man on video

19:40.447 --> 19:41.681
dragging a murder victim
around the corner.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.984
If it were anybody else,
we wouldn't hesitate.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.954
If this is the killer,
we have to find him.

19:47.987 --> 19:48.888
Post it.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.529
(phone chimes)

19:56.563 --> 19:58.498
*

20:03.636 --> 20:04.771
(phone chimes)

20:13.646 --> 20:14.914
(phone chimes)

20:24.957 --> 20:26.626
SARA:
"Take him out"?

20:26.659 --> 20:28.428
"An eye for an eye"?

20:28.461 --> 20:30.963
Let's hope we won't
have to solve another murder.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.338
Referral traffic is way up.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.639
New users have spiked
twelvefold.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.940
Everyone wants
a look at this guy.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.543
Or a piece of him.
"The Beta-Cuck Dictatorship

20:43.576 --> 20:44.577
"of California
got a great man killed.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.613
Get the beaners
out of here."

20:46.646 --> 20:49.048
Spelling obviously not a huge
issue for the Davis crowd.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.850
Can you mark that
as inflammatory.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.852
Uh, where are we with
building out the algorithm

20:52.885 --> 20:54.987
to filter out bias?
I'm already feeding in

20:55.021 --> 20:55.955
the curated responses.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.057
A few more hours,
and we should have

20:58.090 --> 20:58.858
a large enough sample for Sophe

20:59.759 --> 21:00.893
to start identifying bias
on her own.

21:00.927 --> 21:01.594
Let's hope it works.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.397
If it doesn't,
our results could be skewed.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.065
Nobody's offered up an I.D. yet?

21:06.098 --> 21:09.001
No. But we've had probably
50 users attempt to clear him.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.037
Um... "He couldn't
have killed Davis.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.505
He was with me."

21:12.539 --> 21:14.607
Let's mark that
as another false alibi.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.909
I'll teach Sophe
contextual cues.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.978
You have any luck sourcing
those articles on Mia?

21:19.011 --> 21:22.014
All 38 sites that posted
some version of the story

21:22.048 --> 21:23.616
got traced back to a single
article on something called

21:23.650 --> 21:25.618
Celebrity Reality Center.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.987
It's like TMZ,
but with even less scruples.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.489
Well, where did they
get the story?

21:29.522 --> 21:30.990
That I'm still
working on.

21:31.023 --> 21:31.924
Can I borrow you for a second?

21:35.127 --> 21:36.696
Yeah.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.531
I have some concerns
about our user base.

21:38.565 --> 21:39.966
Our numbers
are dropping.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.901
What are you talking about?
Traffic is way up.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.337
New users are up,
but dedicated users,

21:44.371 --> 21:46.573
people who have been on Sophe
for ten days or more...

21:46.606 --> 21:49.609
Watch the change
over the last 24 hours.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.413
That's because of
the Brandt Davis case.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.981
Some because of Davis.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.716
But most of the deletions
are from people

21:56.749 --> 21:58.518
who only looked
at Mia's case.

21:58.551 --> 21:59.986
That doesn't make any sense.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.721
Why would they be leaving
because of Mia?

22:01.754 --> 22:03.956
Jeffrey, Mia's treatment
at Grand Pines

22:03.990 --> 22:05.925
is all over the Internet.

22:05.958 --> 22:08.060
People don't care that
she suffered from depression;

22:08.094 --> 22:11.431
they care that they didn't
hear it from you first.

22:11.464 --> 22:12.965
That's why they're leaving.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.634
It's none of
their damn business.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.404
I didn't start
Sophe to air

22:17.437 --> 22:18.505
Mia's private life in public.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.072
I know.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.941
But this isn't just
your investigation anymore.

22:21.974 --> 22:25.545
Sophe users are invested
in finding Mia's killer,

22:25.578 --> 22:27.079
but they want
something in return.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.081
They want community.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.517
They want access.
They want honesty.

22:30.550 --> 22:33.085
And by withholding it...

22:33.119 --> 22:35.455
you're only going
to alienate them more.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.624
(phone chimes, vibrates)

22:39.191 --> 22:40.560
What is it?

22:40.593 --> 22:41.594
Nothing.

22:41.628 --> 22:42.595
Jeffrey?

22:42.629 --> 22:43.763
No, I hear you.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.498
I do, I do.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.503
(chanting):
All of us! All of us!

22:50.537 --> 22:51.571
CAVANAUGH: We're still
waiting on the ME's report,

22:51.604 --> 22:54.040
but cause of death
seems pretty clear.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.075
Two bullet holes
aren't exactly subtle.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.577
The image we
got from Sophe

22:57.610 --> 22:59.045
is our best lead.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.046
We're still trying
to get an I.D.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.181
Well, hurry up.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.051
We've got unis breaking up
fights all over the city.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.653
Alt-right, Antifa--
where the hell

23:06.686 --> 23:08.154
do they get
these names from, anyway?

23:08.187 --> 23:09.656
Well, if the guy's out there,
we'll find him.

23:09.689 --> 23:12.525
(phone chimes, vibrates)

23:12.559 --> 23:14.627
RUIZ: We might not
have to look too far.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.196
He just turned himself in.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.798
I didn't do it.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.668
I didn't kill
Brandt Davis.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.671
So this isn't you?

23:24.704 --> 23:26.606
This isn't you dragging
Davis from the protest?

23:28.575 --> 23:31.511
Yeah, that's me, but...

23:31.544 --> 23:33.713
(sighs)
...it's not what it looks like.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.615
RUIZ:
Really, Eddie?

23:35.648 --> 23:37.584
Why don't you tell us
what it looks like to you?

23:37.617 --> 23:39.619
I didn't do that.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.188
I dragged him out of there
to save him.

23:42.221 --> 23:43.723
(crowd clamoring)

23:46.158 --> 23:50.096
When the barricades broke down,
it got insane.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.832
He'd have been ripped apart,
so I got him out of there.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.234
RUIZ: Well, that's
awfully charitable,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.069
considering what he says
about people that look like you.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.105
What he says about us

23:59.138 --> 24:01.040
is exactly why
I didn't want him to get hurt.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.742
It would play
right into his narrative.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.309
CAVANAUGH:
You're telling me

24:03.342 --> 24:05.645
you came face-to-face

24:05.678 --> 24:07.614
with the biggest hater
in the country,

24:07.647 --> 24:09.816
and all you can think about
is "his narrative"?

24:09.849 --> 24:13.119
I'm out there
trying to change things.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.588
Illegal border crossings are
at their lowest levels in years,

24:15.622 --> 24:18.591
but all these
people talk about

24:18.625 --> 24:20.860
is Mexican criminals
stealing their jobs.

24:20.893 --> 24:24.497
"Rapists and murderers,"
just like their idol says.

24:24.531 --> 24:26.733
Killing Davis plays
right into their hands.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.167
All right, so you saved him,

24:28.200 --> 24:29.869
you got him out of there,
then what?

24:29.902 --> 24:31.571
I hustled him
down to Fulton Street.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.606
It was quiet there.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.608
And if you're wondering,

24:35.642 --> 24:37.844
no, he didn't say "thank you."

24:37.877 --> 24:39.712
He acted like
I'd done something wrong.

24:39.746 --> 24:43.149
Anyway, um, that's when
a car rolled up,

24:43.182 --> 24:45.585
black SUV, North Dakota plates--

24:45.618 --> 24:48.555
the one with the buffalo
on them-- and he got in.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.156
Alive.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.891
Did you see
who was driving the SUV?

24:51.924 --> 24:54.226
Nah.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.662
Uh, windows were tinted.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.664
Look, I work hard,

24:57.697 --> 24:59.566
I pay taxes.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.167
But I don't have papers.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.235
I'm taking a risk
just showing up here.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.605
You think I'd do that
if I killed Davis?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.911
San Francisco is
a sanctuary city.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.680
That's why Davis was here
in the first place.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.917
So if you didn't do the crime,
there's no reason

25:17.950 --> 25:19.285
for ICE to know
anything about this.

25:19.318 --> 25:22.689
I didn't.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.191
I just got off the phone
with Cavanaugh.

25:25.224 --> 25:27.660
They don't think
the guy in the photo did it,

25:27.694 --> 25:29.829
but they're gonna hold him
for now while they look into it.

25:29.862 --> 25:33.666
Meanwhile, it's all over
the right-wing media

25:33.700 --> 25:39.171
that an undocumented immigrant
may have killed Brandt Davis.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.808
Now people are attacking
Latinos on the street.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.244
(grunting)

25:46.979 --> 25:48.314
SARA:
This is because of us.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.216
This is because of Sophe.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.251
We put his face
out there,

25:52.284 --> 25:54.654
and now people are
using it as an excuse

25:54.687 --> 25:57.223
to jump anyone that
looks like him.
Sara, listen...

25:57.256 --> 26:00.159
What if what we built is
actually making the world worse?

26:00.192 --> 26:02.261
You don't think
that I've wrestled with this?

26:02.294 --> 26:04.964
The Internet was supposed
to bring people together,

26:04.997 --> 26:06.699
but it also created a platform

26:06.733 --> 26:08.234
for them to tear
each other apart.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.169
The worst part

26:10.202 --> 26:12.839
about democracy is that
you have to deal with people

26:12.872 --> 26:14.206
whose ideas you hate.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.842
But it's better
than the alternative.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.244
We can't dictate what people do

26:18.277 --> 26:20.246
with what we make.

26:20.279 --> 26:21.981
But we can steer them
in the right direction.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.983
The right dir...

26:24.016 --> 26:26.285
Right now,
we are helping to create

26:26.318 --> 26:27.854
the worst possible
narrative here.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.722
We're giving the Brandt Davises
of this world

26:29.756 --> 26:31.290
exactly what they want.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.192
Then change the narrative.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.393
Find the right killer.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.261
Just like that.
(snaps fingers)

26:35.294 --> 26:37.630
Have you ever heard of

26:37.664 --> 26:39.265
the Invisible Gorilla
experiment?

26:39.298 --> 26:41.367
They told a group of people
at a basketball game

26:41.400 --> 26:42.835
to count the number of passes.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.905
Half the people were
so focused on the ball,

26:45.938 --> 26:48.875
they didn't see a gorilla walk
through the center of the game.

26:48.908 --> 26:51.644
They only saw
what they were looking for.

26:53.746 --> 26:54.747
(knock on door)

26:54.781 --> 26:55.915
You have a minute?

26:55.948 --> 26:57.349
Yeah. What's going on?

26:57.383 --> 26:59.919
We found the original leak
for the Mia story.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.021
Celebrity Reality Center
got it from a Reddit user

27:02.054 --> 27:04.223
named truthrising776.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.693
The same username
also posted about Mia

27:06.726 --> 27:09.428
all over social media,
all using the same VPN.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.230
So you've got nothing?

27:11.263 --> 27:12.765
Not exactly.
I found and read

27:12.799 --> 27:14.233
all their posts
over the last five years...

27:14.266 --> 27:15.735
They're all
trashy stories,

27:15.768 --> 27:17.436
all damaging to
different politicians.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.906
Whoever he or she is,

27:19.939 --> 27:21.640
Anthony Weiner would
like to punch them.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.913
So what are you saying, Mike?

27:26.946 --> 27:28.380
ALEX:
Opposition research?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.249
On me?

27:30.282 --> 27:32.952
Somebody, somewhere,
leaked the story about Mia

27:32.985 --> 27:34.921
to hurt you politically.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.723
So this is all my fault?

27:36.756 --> 27:38.791
That's not what I'm saying.
You are saying that.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.392
I wanted to let you know
so you could watch your back.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.830
How very kind of you.
You're looking out for me.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.932
I want to find out who took
our daughter away from us,

27:45.965 --> 27:48.034
and if things get messy,
so be it.
So do I.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.902
This is all you, Jeffrey.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.337
This is all on you.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.338
At least I give a damn.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.073
You can tell the press

27:54.106 --> 27:56.809
that my grief has clouded
my judgment all you want,

27:56.843 --> 27:59.345
but at least I'm not
just over it.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.717
Michael, can you stop the car?

28:04.751 --> 28:06.418
Alex, I'm sorry. It's...
Stop the car, Michael.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.087
No, just get out.
Hold on.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.088
Listen to me.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.256
Get out.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.894
*

28:42.254 --> 28:44.223
Byoop. Byoop.
I'm good at the sound.
Don't make the sound.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.058
The game makes the sound.
We are missing the gorilla.

28:46.092 --> 28:48.160
Please tell me this ends
with Josh in a gorilla suit.

28:48.194 --> 28:50.096
I'll have you know
I would rock that suit.
No.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.998
My point is, we've been thinking
about this all wrong.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.100
I hate Davis's politics,

28:54.133 --> 28:56.235
so I assumed politics
is what got him killed.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.104
To be fair, a lot of people
want him dead

28:58.137 --> 28:59.438
because of the crap he spouts.
Yeah.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.407
But because of all that noise,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.310
political motives have been
overrepresented in the data.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.013
There's other reasons
to kill someone.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.882
Let's look at other motives:
uh, money, jealousy, revenge.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.250
Okay.
Yeah.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.419
CAVANAUGH: Got the
traffic cam stills back.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.187
(computer beeps)

29:15.221 --> 29:16.222
Okay, Sara, you're on.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.356
SARA:
Great.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.126
We have Sophe focusing
on non-political data

29:20.159 --> 29:22.361
to see if there's
any other motives involved.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.965
Okay, Eddie Leyva said that
Davis got into a black SUV

29:25.998 --> 29:27.066
with North Dakota plates, right?

29:27.099 --> 29:29.101
(camera clicks)
These were pulled

29:29.135 --> 29:31.103
from the traffic
cam on McAllister,

29:31.137 --> 29:33.339
just around the corner from
where Davis's body was found.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.042
The funny thing is
Mrs. Davis said

29:36.075 --> 29:38.277
that she couldn't find her
husband after the protest,

29:38.310 --> 29:40.479
that she waited for him
in the hotel all night.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.248
(camera clicks)
And this photo

29:42.281 --> 29:44.516
was from a few blocks away,
11 minutes later.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.118
Brandt Davis is gone.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.920
So you think
his wife killed him?

29:47.954 --> 29:49.221
CAVANAUGH
Either that,

29:49.255 --> 29:51.523
or she drove him
to where someone else did.

29:51.557 --> 29:53.259
Question is: why?

29:53.292 --> 29:55.261
TARIQ: Well, we may have
something here.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.363
Several users have posted
pictures of Brandt Davis

29:57.396 --> 29:58.430
on vacation.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.102
Yeah, they're also pointing out
his appearance.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.904
He's got a nice tan,
he's lost weight...

30:06.438 --> 30:08.274
CAVANAUGH:
And that's not his wife.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.475
(chuckles)

30:10.642 --> 30:12.011
TARIQ: Not one of the master
race either, but... (chuckles)

30:13.212 --> 30:14.180
I guess hypocrisy never stopped
anyone from getting laid.

30:14.213 --> 30:15.948
So... what?

30:15.982 --> 30:17.416
Liliana finds out
Brandt is cheating on her,

30:17.449 --> 30:20.987
she decided to end the marriage
by ending Brandt?

30:21.020 --> 30:23.422
JOSH:
Okay, so, weird thing happening.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.157
Users are saying
that the vacation photos

30:25.191 --> 30:26.425
aren't a vacation.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.228
That resort Davis was at,
it's actually something called

30:29.261 --> 30:31.430
the Lifespring Clinic
in Rosarito, Mexico.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.564
SARA:
What do you mean by "clinic"?

30:32.598 --> 30:34.100
It's one of those

30:34.133 --> 30:36.035
hippie-dippy
alternative medicine places

30:36.068 --> 30:38.404
where rich people go
to mainline frankincense cures

30:38.437 --> 30:39.571
or whatever they do.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.573
Never discount
the power of frankincense.

30:41.607 --> 30:44.010
What about that woman?

30:47.279 --> 30:48.948
She's a nurse.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.552
Detective, I don't think
Davis was having an affair.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.586
CAVANAUGH:
No.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.323
He was dying.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.360
Just got the autopsy report.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.263
Brandt Davis had
pancreatic cancer.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.265
He only had a few months
left to live.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.067
Well, that's a coincidence.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.601
Yes, it is, isn't it?

31:09.635 --> 31:11.403
(evidence alert blaring)

31:11.437 --> 31:14.473
Detective, uh,
we are having a bit of an issue.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.075
Can I get back to you?

31:16.108 --> 31:17.243
CAVANAUGH and RUIZ:
Yeah.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.211
It's a troll storm.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.412
We've got so many
photo submissions

31:20.446 --> 31:22.114
it's actually
gumming up our system.

31:22.148 --> 31:23.349
Must be from
Brandt Davis supporters.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.483
Some. But it looks like

31:25.584 --> 31:26.285
most of these are new users,
referred by something

31:26.318 --> 31:28.020
called the Daily Volk-Press.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.355
Great.
It's a Neo-Nazi site.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.190
They've just realized
Liliana Davis

31:31.223 --> 31:33.492
has become a suspect,
and they are not happy about it.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.427
Eddie's supporters
are reacting.

31:35.461 --> 31:37.229
TARIQ: Looks like the left's got
some fight in it, after all.

31:37.263 --> 31:39.131
Less joking, more deleting, huh?

31:49.541 --> 31:51.210
It's a flame war.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.245
These trolls are
coming after Mia.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.647
I know. We're
trying to clear it.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.117
(sighs) Josh, what about
the bias algorithm?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.651
I'm not sure it's ready.

31:59.685 --> 32:03.555
Well, I can't imagine
a better time to find out.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.592
Right, yeah, okay.
Um, all right, here goes.

32:06.625 --> 32:09.395
If it works, the algorithm
will cancel out the responses

32:09.428 --> 32:11.130
from the extreme
left and right,

32:11.163 --> 32:13.165
leaving us with
the unbiased middle.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.683
Real-time bias
correction. You did it.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.285
Nice work.
JOSH: Thanks.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.621
SARA: See? Sophe can
handle user bias.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.389
Slow your roll there, M.I.T.,
you're no Jedi yet.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.557
Shut up.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.459
SARA:
Look.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.694
Users are sending in
video files.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.696
BRANDT: We all know the only
reason people remember Malcolm X

32:44.730 --> 32:46.698
is 'cause he was killed.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.367
Name one thing
he actually accomplished.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.570
Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Gandhi--

32:51.603 --> 32:53.572
I disagree with their beliefs,

32:53.605 --> 32:55.541
but I admire them
for sticking to them.

32:55.574 --> 32:59.445
They'd be relics in history
if not for their deaths.

32:59.478 --> 33:03.682
But because of that...
we'll remember them forever.

33:03.715 --> 33:08.254
Weird that Davis had a thing for
civil rights leaders, isn't it?

33:08.287 --> 33:10.589
Not the leaders,
their deaths.

33:10.622 --> 33:13.259
They were all assassinated.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.727
Are you saying Brandt wanted
to die at that rally?

33:15.761 --> 33:17.363
He was already dying.

33:17.396 --> 33:19.398
If you're this guy,

33:19.431 --> 33:23.335
what better way to go out
than becoming a martyr?

33:28.374 --> 33:31.677
Thank you for agreeing to
speak with us again, Mrs. Davis.

33:31.710 --> 33:34.413
If you want counsel present,
you're entitled to that.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.720
I'm fine.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.489
What is this about?

33:43.522 --> 33:45.424
We were wondering
if maybe

33:45.457 --> 33:47.826
you weren't completely
honest with us earlier.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.362
We know your
husband was sick.

33:50.396 --> 33:52.298
Pancreatic cancer
is no picnic.

33:52.331 --> 33:55.234
And we also know
how much you loved him.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.403
It'd take a lot of love
to do what you did.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.505
I didn't do anything.

33:59.538 --> 34:03.609
You didn't make your husband
a martyr, just like he wanted?

34:03.642 --> 34:05.711
Brandt is a martyr.

34:05.744 --> 34:07.546
An illegal killed him

34:07.579 --> 34:10.716
because he didn't like
what Brandt believed.

34:10.749 --> 34:13.452
Sad as it is, that's
the America we live in now.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.759
This was taken

34:20.792 --> 34:22.461
right before your
husband was killed.

34:22.494 --> 34:26.298
Right before you drove him
to that alley

34:26.332 --> 34:28.500
and shot him.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.438
No.

34:32.471 --> 34:33.705
We found your car.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.408
Our techs lifted traces
of gunpowder and blood

34:36.442 --> 34:37.643
off the steering wheel.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.445
The DNA cinches it.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.879
CAVANAUGH: We also
found the sniper's nest

34:40.912 --> 34:42.481
in the building
across the street.

34:42.514 --> 34:44.416
Kind of hard
to conceal the hole

34:44.450 --> 34:46.518
your husband's guy
cut into the glass.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.554
He had somebody all
ready to take him out

34:48.587 --> 34:50.622
in full view of everyone,
didn't he?

34:50.656 --> 34:53.259
Till Eddie Leyva
spoiled his plan.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.606
Brandt was so smart,
you know.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.875
He was always reading,

35:09.908 --> 35:11.710
especially history.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.713
He loved history--
Roman, Greek.

35:14.746 --> 35:18.417
In another life, maybe he would
have been a professor.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.387
From the day I met him,

35:21.420 --> 35:23.689
I knew he was destined
to leave a mark.

35:23.722 --> 35:29.328
Dying of cancer is so...
average.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.730
And your husband wasn't average,
was he, Mrs. Davis?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.666
Progress demands sacrifice.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.568
He always said.

35:36.602 --> 35:39.471
And he walked the walk.

35:39.505 --> 35:42.474
He made the ultimate sacrifice
for his cause.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.876
The way I see it...

35:47.446 --> 35:49.815
...this evidence can
tell two stories.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.351
The first is about
a scheming woman

35:52.384 --> 35:54.653
who murdered her
husband in cold blood.

35:54.686 --> 35:57.489
The second is a story
of a loving wife

35:57.523 --> 36:01.427
who granted her dying
husband's last wish.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.762
Now, we can't do
anything for a murderer.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.698
But for a loving wife...

36:06.732 --> 36:09.435
we can talk
to the D.A. for her.

36:09.468 --> 36:13.705
Maybe get the
charges reduced.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.342
All you have to do is write down
your confession, Mrs. Davis.

36:17.776 --> 36:19.878
Say that your husband
put you up to this.

36:40.666 --> 36:43.402
I need you to
understand.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.837
If you don't, there's
nothing we can do for you.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.474
You will spend the rest
of your life in prison

36:48.507 --> 36:50.642
just for helping
the man you loved.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.814
I didn't help him
do anything.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.716
Mrs. Davis.
I told you.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.552
Brandt was killed by an illegal.

37:00.586 --> 37:03.489
Somebody who shouldn't even be
in this white country.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.757
And that's how
he'll be remembered,

37:05.791 --> 37:08.594
as a martyr...

37:08.627 --> 37:10.396
forever.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.503
(door opens)

37:17.536 --> 37:19.405
Take Mrs. Davis
to booking.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.515
BRANDT:
We're still here.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.950
And we're ready to fight
for this cause,

37:31.983 --> 37:33.985
ready to die for it.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.555
And we will prevail,

37:36.588 --> 37:40.058
because when truth is on
your side, nothing else matters.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.927
BOORMAN: Those were
Brandt's last words to us.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.896
He lived a hero
and he died a martyr.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.867
He dared to speak the truth, and
an illegal killed him for it.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.936
Don't believe the fake news

37:50.969 --> 37:53.071
the mainstream media
is trying to sell.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.973
Liliana loved Brandt
more than anything.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.476
She'd never have hurt him.

37:57.509 --> 37:59.745
It's inconceivable.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.080
Well, regardless of how you feel
about Brandt Davis or his views,

38:02.113 --> 38:05.484
the official story
doesn't add up.

38:05.517 --> 38:08.954
And isn't it a coincidence
that Jeffrey Tanner is involved?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.657
You know,
Alex Hale's ex-husband,

38:11.690 --> 38:13.659
whose own daughter
may have known something

38:13.692 --> 38:15.561
that some people
didn't want out there.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.028
Isn't that all neat and tidy?

38:17.062 --> 38:19.565
People are outraged.

38:19.598 --> 38:22.100
We can't keep up with
all the calls we're getting.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.802
TANNER: A white
supremacist martyr.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.937
It's like jumbo shrimp.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.973
Real story is out there.

38:28.006 --> 38:31.477
Eventually, the truth matters.
Has to.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.747
What can I do for you,
Detective?

38:39.651 --> 38:42.854
I got a call.

38:42.888 --> 38:45.724
Carlos Ochoa was
attacked in prison.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.825
He was stabbed.

38:46.858 --> 38:50.729
Good news is
he survived.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.865
18 hours of surgery,
but he pulled through.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.702
Bad news is he's in a coma.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.138
Docs don't know if
he'll ever wake up.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.874
Look, Tanner, I know this is not
what you want to hear, and...

39:02.908 --> 39:05.811
I started this investigation
for Mia,

39:05.844 --> 39:09.515
and now Carlos Ochoa
is a victim, too.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.758
I have to believe
there's something to it all.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.530
I have to see it through.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.601
Hey, Dad.

39:29.635 --> 39:31.737
Um, your office said
you're out of town,

39:31.770 --> 39:34.840
so figured you'd like
the personal touch. (chuckles)

39:34.873 --> 39:36.141
Anyways,

39:36.174 --> 39:39.745
um, can't wait
to see you tomorrow.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.748
Hey, I know I probably
don't say this enough,

39:42.781 --> 39:44.883
but I love you, Dad.

39:44.916 --> 39:47.653
And, um, I know
we've had our problems,

39:47.686 --> 39:50.055
but I wouldn't be
who I am without you.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.758
So... anyways, travel safe.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.660
Love you.

39:54.693 --> 39:55.927
Already said that, didn't I?

39:55.961 --> 39:58.564
(laughs) Okay. Bye.

40:07.939 --> 40:11.142
That's who my daughter was...

40:11.176 --> 40:13.078
a bright, generous spirit

40:13.111 --> 40:16.682
who spent her time
helping others.

40:16.715 --> 40:19.851
But she wasn't above
needing help herself.

40:19.885 --> 40:21.920
The truth is...

40:21.953 --> 40:24.990
I wasn't upfront about
Mia's stay at Grand Pines.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.695
She was a private person,
and I...

40:29.728 --> 40:32.698
I just wanted to respect that,
but, in the end,

40:32.731 --> 40:38.236
my silence damaged your trust
in me and in Sophe.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.707
And for that, I'm very sorry.

40:41.740 --> 40:45.744
I see now that Mia's case
doesn't just belong to me.

40:45.777 --> 40:49.147
It belongs to everyone
who joined in to help us.

40:49.180 --> 40:53.985
So, as of today...

40:54.019 --> 40:58.123
I promise complete transparency.

40:58.156 --> 41:02.060
I'm putting everything
that I have about my daughter

41:02.093 --> 41:03.995
on Sophe.

41:04.029 --> 41:07.833
The truth matters.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.135
And I hope...

41:10.168 --> 41:13.739
I hope that this
restores your faith,

41:13.772 --> 41:15.273
so that together

41:15.306 --> 41:20.712
we can do what's right,
once and for all.

41:20.746 --> 41:23.048
For Mia.

41:25.050 --> 41:28.019
Are you sure?

41:28.053 --> 41:30.155
Yes.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.290
Even the police files.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.925
Everything.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.003
Even Mia's video?

41:45.036 --> 41:46.271
Post it.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.747
Post it all.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.818
(computer beeps)

42:08.727 --> 42:10.195
It's working.
