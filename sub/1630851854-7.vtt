00:07.967 --> 00:11.679
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:11.804 --> 00:14.974
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:15.891 --> 00:20.312
<i>Careful. If you touch his nerves,</i>
<i>he'll end up walking backwards. </i>

00:21.188 --> 00:24.942
I'll have to take all his wife's bitching.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.610
Suction here.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.197
Excuse me, Professor,
there's an emergency in Radiology.

00:30.322 --> 00:34.034
Carmela, can't you see I'm operating?
What is it? A fire? Earthquake?

00:34.118 --> 00:35.953
It's someone who can't wait.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.875
Cauterize, Sibilo.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.086
Are you crazy?

00:44.128 --> 00:46.172
Who can be such a pain in the ass?

00:47.590 --> 00:49.508
Diego Armando Maradona.

00:51.635 --> 00:55.598
What the fuck do I care?
Who's Diego Armando Maradona?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.975
I'm in my home.
And he wants me to come out?

00:58.058 --> 01:00.269
I'm doing surgery. Panunzio, you close.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.104
- Shouldn't you finish?
- What for?

01:02.188 --> 01:04.982
It's a lost case. You close it.

01:05.524 --> 01:08.277
I don't get it.
How can he be so important?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.864
Diego Armando Maradona.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.867
I'm not interested in who he is.

01:14.950 --> 01:19.497
I'm performing a very difficult surgery

01:19.997 --> 01:23.584
and Diego Armando Maradona comes in.
I'm not interested in him.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.711
Who the hell is
Diego Armando Maradona?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.643
BLESSED DREAM

02:22.810 --> 02:24.520
FREE

02:31.735 --> 02:35.948
"The day Maradona stopped being Pelusa,"
wrote Suárez.

02:36.699 --> 02:38.158
He can suck my dick.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.160
He's a nobody.

02:44.748 --> 02:50.087
<i>Only six months before the 1986 World Cup,</i>

02:50.588 --> 02:52.548
<i>in just two minutes,</i>

02:52.631 --> 02:55.467
<i>a devastating earthquake</i>
<i>shook Mexico City,</i>

02:55.551 --> 02:58.554
<i>killing more than 10,000 people.</i>

02:59.346 --> 03:02.808
<i>Jorge Cyterszpiler was there,</i>
<i>and he survived.</i>

03:02.892 --> 03:05.352
<i>But his life was shook differently.</i>

03:07.104 --> 03:11.442
<i>The unexpected ending of his partnership</i>
<i>with his friend Pelusa.</i>

03:14.236 --> 03:19.283
<i>Diego Maradona's decision to remove Jorge</i>
<i>from his career and his life</i>

03:19.366 --> 03:23.287
<i>would have consequences</i>
<i>that are still visible today.</i>

03:24.914 --> 03:27.124
<i>It is impossible to know for sure,</i>

03:27.207 --> 03:29.501
<i>but it's certain that Jorge's departure</i>

03:29.585 --> 03:32.880
<i>and the arrival of Guillermo Coppola</i>
<i>as his replacement</i>

03:32.963 --> 03:35.049
<i>caused a dramatic turn.</i>

03:36.008 --> 03:41.889
<i>From the irreverent and insolent brat</i>
<i>who had the purest soccer talent,</i>

03:41.972 --> 03:44.308
<i>- remained the ability and talent.</i>
- Diego!

03:44.391 --> 03:48.479
<i>But the spirit of the neighborhood kid</i>
<i>gave way to the temptation</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:52.900
<i>of belonging in the same crowd</i>
<i>as his new manager.</i>

03:55.986 --> 03:59.782
<i>Jorge Cyterszpiler, before being</i>
<i>Diego's manager, was his friend.</i>

04:00.449 --> 04:02.242
Come on, Diego!

04:02.701 --> 04:06.830
<i>Would he have had such an unstable</i>
<i>and turbulent sports career,</i>

04:06.914 --> 04:09.583
<i>had he kept Cyterszpiler as his manager?</i>

04:12.544 --> 04:17.091
- Where's the money you stole from Diego?
- I didn't steal anything from Diego.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.510
A couple of investments went wrong.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.679
You know I love him like a brother.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.602
Leave Naples now.

04:28.686 --> 04:31.981
<i>Guillermo Coppola,</i>
<i>before being Diego's manager,</i>

04:32.064 --> 04:34.942
<i>handled more than</i>
<i>150 soccer players' finances.</i>

04:37.403 --> 04:39.113
- It was totally out.
- Come on!

04:39.196 --> 04:44.368
<i>In 1985, he found Maradona at his peak,</i>
<i>awaiting his global breakthrough.</i>

04:45.536 --> 04:47.871
<i>Skillful and intuitive in business,</i>

04:48.872 --> 04:53.544
<i>Coppola arrived to the soccer business</i>
<i>from a simple bank teller position,</i>

04:54.128 --> 04:56.422
<i>making connections with players that</i>

04:57.047 --> 05:00.759
<i>would approach him to get</i>
<i>financial advice from the bank.</i>

05:01.343 --> 05:04.304
<i>The word of mouth of his first clients</i>

05:04.930 --> 05:07.641
<i>opened a way to a new career.</i>

05:07.725 --> 05:11.395
<i>And soon, he became</i>
<i>a celebrity of Buenos Aires' nightlife,</i>

05:11.645 --> 05:15.399
<i>due to his glamour,</i>
<i>his ability to traffic drugs,</i>

05:15.691 --> 05:19.319
<i>and his playboy and party boy fame.</i>

05:19.737 --> 05:23.282
<i>Diego and Guillermo's</i>
<i>was love at first sight.</i>

05:23.365 --> 05:26.952
<i>It was born the day Maradona signed</i>
<i>his transfer to Boca Juniors,</i>

05:27.036 --> 05:30.164
<i>and they craved each other</i>
<i>from that moment on.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:32.124
<i>With Coppola,</i>

05:32.249 --> 05:36.795
<i>Diego left behind Pelusa,</i>
<i>from Villa Fiorito.</i>

05:37.880 --> 05:42.426
<i>For Coppola, winning Diego's heart</i>
<i>was like touching the sky.</i>

05:43.052 --> 05:47.806
<i>He became the man</i>
<i>behind the God of soccer.</i>

05:47.890 --> 05:52.269
<i>For Maradona, Guillermo was the key</i>
<i>to access a social circle</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:55.022
<i>that until then, revered him as a player,</i>

05:55.105 --> 05:57.941
<i>but still rejected him</i>
<i>because of his origins.</i>

05:59.943 --> 06:03.947
<i>The new manager soon won the approval</i>
<i>of Diego's social environment.</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:06.075
How did I get on the magazine covers?

06:06.158 --> 06:07.701
Do you really want to know?

06:08.327 --> 06:10.120
Thanks to my twins.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.917
<i>Coppola quickly solved</i>
<i>the financial crisis,</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:18.295
<i>renegotiated</i>
<i>Maradona's contract with Napoli,</i>

06:18.378 --> 06:20.214
<i>wiping off the map the people</i>

06:20.297 --> 06:23.383
<i>who had accompanied Diego</i>
<i>in his European adventure,</i>

06:23.926 --> 06:27.387
<i>and neutralized</i>
<i>any potential conflict with Claudia.</i>

06:29.056 --> 06:32.726
<i>Not only did he conquer her</i>
<i>with his charisma and likeability,</i>

06:33.227 --> 06:34.978
<i>he also placed her father Coco</i>

06:35.062 --> 06:38.649
<i>and Don Chitoro in charge</i>
<i>of Darma's offices in Buenos Aires.</i>

06:38.899 --> 06:42.236
<i>They were simple men and easy to control.</i>

06:46.156 --> 06:48.617
<i>What came after that</i>
<i>is already known by all.</i>

06:48.700 --> 06:53.205
<i>The tree overshadowed the forest</i>
<i>and Diego became a God.</i>

06:53.288 --> 06:57.417
<i>And, amidst all the drama and emotion,</i>
<i>it was impossible</i>

06:58.085 --> 07:02.965
<i>to notice that Pelusa,</i>
<i>from Villa Fiorito, was long gone.</i>

07:05.634 --> 07:08.137
<i>Once, on the banks of the Paraná,</i>

07:09.054 --> 07:13.559
<i>when he still had the essence</i>
<i>of the boy who dreamed of a World Cup,</i>

07:14.434 --> 07:18.939
<i>Diego confessed to me</i>
<i>that he was not a "happiness machine."</i>

07:20.315 --> 07:21.984
<i>But he couldn't restrain himself.</i>

07:22.276 --> 07:26.196
<i>He gave happiness</i>
<i>until his heart said, "Enough" and...</i>

07:30.951 --> 07:32.202
Son of a bitch.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.122
They put together
a special edition in case I died?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.499
I screwed them up.

07:37.583 --> 07:38.834
I really did screw them.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.337
Who called me? Did Menotti call?

07:45.340 --> 07:46.258
Bilardo?

07:48.510 --> 07:49.678
Did the President call?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.638
Did Pelé say anything?

07:51.722 --> 07:54.474
Everyone called.
Those who love you, those who don't.

07:54.558 --> 07:57.102
Those who you hate, those who hate you.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.354
Still the center of the world,
don't worry.

07:59.438 --> 08:03.192
Those who hate me
wanted to make sure I died.

08:03.275 --> 08:07.029
Or rather, they wanted to know
if I became retarded.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.366
And I didn't.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.164
That brunette is hot.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.043
Beautiful.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.295
You always liked blondes.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.799
What a waste of luxury.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.471
With all the money the Vatican has,
they could fight world hunger.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.181
You should have told the Pope,

08:34.264 --> 08:36.725
but you shut your mouth when you saw him.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.065
Why do you contradict me so much, Clau?

08:46.276 --> 08:47.778
Why should I be mad?

08:50.197 --> 08:53.825
I don't know.
I don't remember a damn thing.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.829
- Maybe we had a fight.
- Most likely.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.166
Let's do something.

09:01.250 --> 09:05.295
Because of the fear I have of being
left alone with the girls forever,

09:05.712 --> 09:09.424
let's pretend that
I also had a mental blackout.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.344
I don't remember anything.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.764
Come on, <i>bruja</i> .

09:17.266 --> 09:19.726
You remember the reason, I know you.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.437
I never forget anything, Maradona.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.412
Gianni. My love.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.581
My little princess, you see I'm fine?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.169
You see I'm fine?

09:48.171 --> 09:52.009
Dalmi. Come here, sweetie,
I can't stretch. Everything hurts.

09:53.969 --> 09:54.970
What's wrong?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.597
I'm scared.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.351
Scared of what?

10:01.852 --> 10:03.687
I'm scared you're going to die.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.774
No, I'm not going to die, my love.

10:10.777 --> 10:15.198
NAPLES, ITALY.

10:15.657 --> 10:20.495
Look, I would love to give you
a severance payment,

10:21.788 --> 10:26.251
but the thing is that Jorge
left me broke, you know?

10:26.460 --> 10:29.296
I still have to pay
the debts he left me with.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.922
Yes, I know.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.842
I know it perfectly well.
Anyway, the truth is

10:34.634 --> 10:37.679
that these years
of working together were great.

10:38.055 --> 10:42.601
I appreciate them, I have fond memories
of so many moments.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.188
Let's not start with this funeral,

10:46.271 --> 10:50.734
because in two-three days, you will
call me to do an article for a newspaper,

10:50.817 --> 10:54.029
and when you're on the other side,
don't forget we're friends.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.906
I wish it was that fast.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.201
No, it's not easy to get a job.
It's very difficult.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.244
I have two children and...

11:01.578 --> 11:05.165
I had an idea, let's see what you think.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.626
I want to write your biography.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.172
A book about my life?

11:15.926 --> 11:17.052
How much do I make?

11:19.096 --> 11:21.056
What? From the book?

11:21.139 --> 11:24.017
You're telling me
it's a book about my life.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.813
I've taken care of living my life,
half the job's done.

11:29.439 --> 11:33.652
Sure, but if we have to share the profits,
I'll be left with nothing.

11:34.736 --> 11:38.698
And if you don't share the profits,
I'm left with nothing.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.119
People have been eating
out of my pockets for years.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.245
That's over.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.623
I don't know,
I thought of it as a compensation

11:46.706 --> 11:49.835
for that severance pay
that you said you couldn't give me,

11:49.918 --> 11:52.712
which hurt you so much.
It was just an idea.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.345
I'd rather not.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.931
I'd rather not.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.934
Something will come up for you.

12:13.191 --> 12:17.320
<i>They don't live in the hotel anymore,</i>
<i>now they are in a house.</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:22.325
The sister, María, lives downstairs,
and Diego, upstairs with his girlfriend.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.121
So, who will be my boss, Claudia or María?

12:26.204 --> 12:29.291
Claudia comes and goes
to Naples all the time.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.127
But when she's there, she's in charge.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.588
She doesn't like María
or Tota to interfere.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.591
Mrs. Tota? Does she live downstairs, too?

12:37.674 --> 12:40.969
Sure. When she visits,
she also comes and goes.

12:46.224 --> 12:52.189
Any weird situations that you experience
in the house, you talk to me.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.108
I work directly with Mr. Coppola.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.943
Diego, coffee? Water?

12:57.027 --> 12:59.529
- No, thanks. Is Gonzalo at the office?
- Yes.

13:00.238 --> 13:03.700
Tomorrow, they're going to the Vatican
to meet the Pope.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.826
How nice.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.162
- Gonzalito.
- You made it.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.748
I'll close the door.
Let's not make a fuss.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.168
It won't be easy with me
like with Ricardo.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.713
You won't throw me out
on the street without money, okay?

13:16.796 --> 13:19.382
All right, but listen, Gonzalo,

13:19.799 --> 13:23.178
you talked to Jorge, they said
they were going to make a movie,

13:23.261 --> 13:26.806
and, if I want to buy tickets for it,
where is it? There's no movie.

13:26.890 --> 13:31.811
No. Listen, I shot the film,
so, it's not my fault if there's no film.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.523
Okay, but you have to talk
to Jorge about it.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.234
I have nothing to do with it.
This is beyond me.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.693
You're firing me.

13:39.861 --> 13:43.198
You'll have to pay me, son of a bitch.

13:43.281 --> 13:46.535
- Don't talk about Tota.
- Tota can suck my dick.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.120
- Yeah? What's wrong with you?
- Stop, man!

13:50.830 --> 13:51.706
Piece of shit!

13:52.582 --> 13:54.292
This is a unique situation.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.252
I'll kill you!

13:55.335 --> 13:59.172
This doesn't normally happen, okay?
He's a very caring person, Diego.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.092
You wouldn't mind
signing the contract now?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.553
If you want to read it, that's fine.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.637
Okay.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.514
- Is everything okay?
- Fucker!

14:21.403 --> 14:26.199
VATICAN CITY, ITALY.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.589
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

14:45.135 --> 14:47.345
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.644
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

15:48.740 --> 15:53.703
<i>To be Maradona,</i>
<i>you need high moral principles.</i>

15:55.413 --> 16:00.293
Every great athlete has been a messenger
of peace and friendship,

16:01.086 --> 16:06.716
so, they were chosen by Jesus
to show his brothers

16:09.427 --> 16:11.096
the right path.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.515
Diego, I bless you

16:14.974 --> 16:17.852
so that you can keep being that model.

16:19.187 --> 16:20.522
Thank you, Your Holiness.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.274
I want to give you a present.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
Yours is special, Diego.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.425
They all look the same to me.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.428
It was blessed by the Pope.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.644
Thanks.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.606
One question.
Is this ceiling made of gold?

17:06.151 --> 17:07.318
I think so, yes.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.966
Well, what's up, boys?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.551
What's up, guys?

17:31.634 --> 17:34.846
You're all butt naked.
Have you trained already? What's this?

17:34.929 --> 17:36.765
Sure, pretend you don't understand.

17:36.848 --> 17:40.185
You speak more Spanish than I do,
and learn to speak, too.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.812
Bunch of assholes.
How are you, professor?

17:44.189 --> 17:47.358
Sons of bitches, you're exposing me.

17:49.569 --> 17:54.032
Professor, to be honest, I only came here
because we agreed to meet up,

17:54.115 --> 17:57.702
I mean, with my achy knee
and my girlfriend snoozing at home,

17:57.786 --> 17:59.454
I felt like staying.

18:00.789 --> 18:05.084
When are we going to talk to Oliva?
I don't know if I should have surgery.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.170
Ask him how I should train.

18:07.253 --> 18:10.298
Why don't you guys take a shower?
Go take a shower.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.175
Go on, girls, go take a shower.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.512
Don't touch each other,
you might get pregnant.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.888
Come on!

18:18.932 --> 18:21.267
Why would I talk to Oliva
if I'm almost out?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.478
Almost out?

18:24.771 --> 18:28.942
- Your new secretary called. Cecilia.
- Cecilia, yes.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.319
She said this was my last month.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.405
How could it be your last month?

18:34.489 --> 18:38.284
The World Cup is coming up,
how could we kick you out?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.161
Are you crazy? We're a team.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.080
No, don't worry.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.751
You promised I was going to get there
looking like a bull, so?

18:47.877 --> 18:50.839
See? You don't trust me.
We can't work like that.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.176
Diego.

18:58.721 --> 19:02.308
- I've never meddled in your private life.
- Yeah.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.644
But if we're going to work together,

19:06.396 --> 19:08.565
I need you to trust me.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.192
- Yes, of course.
- Tell the truth.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.282
Are you using cocaine?

19:18.658 --> 19:22.620
No. How could you ask me
a question like that? Of course not.

19:24.289 --> 19:27.625
Maybe a little bump at a party, one night.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.962
But no. I've got it all under control.

19:31.045 --> 19:35.008
Besides, I wouldn't be able
to perform if I did that. No, please.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.247
<i>Maradona between two defense players</i>
<i>from Roma.</i>

20:48.498 --> 20:51.042
<i>Scissor kick, incredible, out. Amazing.</i>

20:51.125 --> 20:55.380
<i>Here, with his head, Maradona,</i>
<i>almost goal, the Argentinian came in late.</i>

20:55.964 --> 20:58.925
<i>Maradona with the right foot,</i>
<i>kick... saved!</i>

20:59.300 --> 21:02.136
<i>Maradona, Maradona moves forward,</i>
<i>Maradona, Maradona,</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:05.181
<i>ball on the right foot,</i>
<i>to the middle, Bruscolotti, goal!</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:09.018
<i>Goal by Bruscolotti.</i>
<i>The Roma goalkeeper could not stop it. </i>

21:09.602 --> 21:12.647
<i>They hug and celebrate</i>

21:13.356 --> 21:15.525
<i>in front of the Olympic athletic track.</i>

21:16.567 --> 21:20.279
<i>A foul on Maradona that...</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:25.410
<i>Maradona moves forward, Maradona...</i>
<i>Goal. Goal, goal, goal, incredible.</i>

21:25.702 --> 21:27.912
<i>Maradona, Maradona, the man.</i>

21:28.579 --> 21:32.834
<i>Who of his rivals can take the ball</i>
<i>away from him? Corner shot, and goal.</i>

21:33.001 --> 21:34.043
<i>Incredible.</i>

21:34.919 --> 21:36.796
<i>Head shot by Bruscolotti.</i>

21:37.255 --> 21:39.507
<i>He scores and they hug tightly.</i>

21:39.632 --> 21:42.802
<i>A massive hug between the two teammates.</i>
<i>With the captain.</i>

21:44.470 --> 21:47.223
<i>Maradona, Maradona, Maradona, goal.</i>

21:47.390 --> 21:49.976
<i>Goal, goal, goal, with his corner shot. </i>

21:50.393 --> 21:53.354
<i>Napoli climbs to the top</i>
<i>of the league table, </i>

21:53.479 --> 21:55.857
<i>thanks to the exploits</i>
<i>of its young captain,</i>

21:55.940 --> 21:57.608
<i>Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

21:57.692 --> 22:00.486
Diego, Diego, Diego, Diego, Diego!

22:21.132 --> 22:23.051
No, no, don't leave, stay.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.189
- Come on, you can't fall asleep.
- I can.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.816
- Wake up.
- No.

22:38.900 --> 22:42.695
We said it was a quickie
and then you'd go training.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.491
- No.
- Come on, do you want breakfast in bed?

22:48.659 --> 22:52.497
- Well, lunch, because it's00.
- Tell Juana to bring it.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.166
Juana isn't here, we're alone.

22:55.249 --> 22:57.335
- We're alone and I have to train?
- Yes.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.838
- Clau, stop fucking around.
- You have to go. Come on.

23:04.342 --> 23:05.843
Come on, Diego, wake up.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.056
Don't fall asleep.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.767
- That's cute, Mom.
- I love this one.

23:12.850 --> 23:14.685
That's what you'll wear?

23:14.769 --> 23:17.772
Your husband will think
you're a slut and leave you.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.942
Don't be mean, Mom.
You could wear it for Daddy.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.569
Claudia. We've been waiting for you.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.114
This is Cata Chris. She's my friend.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.491
Cristiana, very nice to meet you.

23:28.616 --> 23:29.826
Hi, how are you?

23:29.909 --> 23:32.453
Not for sleeping, for going to bed.

23:32.537 --> 23:35.790
Why don't you buy one, Claudia,
these are so nice.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.583
I don't know.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.710
How much is this one?

23:39.794 --> 23:41.212
Thirty thousand lira.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.296
No, thanks.

23:43.005 --> 23:46.092
I can give you a little discount... 27.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.470
- She'll give you a discount.
- I don't need it, don't want it.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.013
Thanks.

23:51.097 --> 23:54.267
I'll make breakfast for Diego.
I thought we were alone.

23:54.350 --> 23:55.518
I like this one.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.353
- Which one, Lili?
- This one.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.105
- Which one?
- This one.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.606
- One, Mom.
- One each.

24:00.690 --> 24:03.693
- One each.
- You can come to the house as you like...

24:04.193 --> 24:05.695
How much is that one?

24:05.778 --> 24:07.613
Should I come back?

24:07.697 --> 24:08.531
Not at all.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.907
Are you sure?

24:09.991 --> 24:11.242
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.496
Excuse me.

24:17.707 --> 24:18.708
Hello.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.841
Did you get some sleep?

24:26.924 --> 24:28.926
- No.
- Let's see.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.596
Help me, so you're more stable.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.355
You're strong, baby.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.399
There, is that okay?

24:48.571 --> 24:50.865
- Are you hungry?
- Very.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.951
Good, I brought you something yummy.

24:55.536 --> 24:56.537
I see.

25:00.625 --> 25:01.876
Hey, baby,

25:03.169 --> 25:04.754
when I get out of here,

25:05.296 --> 25:06.881
we'll go partying.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.758
We'll play tennis.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.428
Racquet back, racquet forward. Smash.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.889
As long as you get out
of here alive, sure.

25:15.598 --> 25:19.101
The doctors don't know
if you'll make it yet.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.686
Don't be mean.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.984
Get me the remote, will you?

25:27.318 --> 25:32.198
I'm tired of watching them
fuck and screw and copulate.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.699
- I can't.
- Please.

25:33.783 --> 25:36.410
I can't. Madam's orders. You know I can't.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.747
You'll watch the news, what they say
about you and go crazy.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.791
What do the say?

25:42.250 --> 25:45.169
What stories
are these motherfuckers telling?

25:45.836 --> 25:48.381
Everything. Lots of breaking news.

25:48.464 --> 25:52.468
The latest is that they found out
you scored a goal against the English

25:52.551 --> 25:53.552
with your hand.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.098
No kidding. Really?

25:57.181 --> 25:59.267
- Yes.
- No way.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.854
- Hey.
- What?

26:03.938 --> 26:08.234
I had a ring in this finger
that I always wear.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.486
Do you know what happened?

26:10.569 --> 26:14.657
The doctors take those off to examine you.

26:15.199 --> 26:16.200
Yes.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.660
Will you check for me?

26:17.994 --> 26:19.870
- Everything good?
- Yes.

26:19.996 --> 26:21.539
- All good. Excuse me.
- Yes.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.045
- Mom.
- My baby.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.299
You won't guess who came to see you.

26:32.174 --> 26:33.592
Who?

26:33.676 --> 26:35.219
- It's a surprise.
- Hi.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.555
- How are you?
- I'll leave you.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.557
- Thanks.
- Doctor.

26:40.683 --> 26:41.892
Nice to see you.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.061
- So nice to see you.
- How are you?

26:44.145 --> 26:47.148
We're getting there. Nice hair color.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.566
Do you like it?

26:48.649 --> 26:51.277
- I'll eat your Jell-O.
- Go ahead.

26:51.360 --> 26:55.823
- Thank you. To your health.
- Thanks.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.241
How's Buenos Aires?

26:58.117 --> 26:59.035
Nice.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.828
Full of people.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.170
On the 31st, while...

27:10.963 --> 27:12.131
Everyone toasted,

27:14.050 --> 27:16.802
for a better year,

27:18.429 --> 27:20.431
I almost didn't live for two days.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.144
God...

27:26.937 --> 27:28.773
He asked me to come back.

27:28.856 --> 27:32.985
You saw the light at the end
of the tunnel and turned around,

27:33.069 --> 27:35.404
in case it was a car coming at you.

27:36.489 --> 27:38.657
Right? May I?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.620
I neglected myself.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.290
I didn't care for myself.

27:46.957 --> 27:50.002
For Dalma and Giannina's sakes,
I don't want to die.

27:50.878 --> 27:54.924
And that's great, Diego.
It's the most important thing. The kids.

27:55.007 --> 27:58.761
Your children, the family.
Terrible, God, terrible.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.682
Uruguayan soccer is terrible, Diego.

28:03.766 --> 28:06.769
They start kicking when they're young.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.772
It is terrible. Look at that.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.736
Are you okay, Diego?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.947
Look. Here, Reina cuts you off.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.326
And forces you. Pass back.
Pass to the back. No, do you understand?

28:22.410 --> 28:25.871
I want you to stand here.
I want you standing there.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.041
I don't know,
I stand where the play asks me to.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.502
No, dear.
The play doesn't ask you anything.

28:31.585 --> 28:34.630
You ask for coffee, a croissant.
The play is put together.

28:34.713 --> 28:40.344
When you are on defense, without the ball.
Look. I'll show you something.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.640
I want to show you. Look. Here, let's see?

28:44.723 --> 28:49.603
See? You're a magnet.
A natural magnet. Look. Four guys.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.647
One, two, three, four.

28:51.772 --> 28:55.109
Don't touch the screen,
you'll leave marks, Carlos.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.737
Yes, you're right.
They're all over you. They caught on.

28:58.821 --> 29:01.407
Why? They don't make a man-to-man mark.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.492
One guy and four around.

29:03.576 --> 29:06.245
Got it? What should we do?
Move without the ball.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.832
Learn to move without the ball.
You'll do that with me.

29:10.624 --> 29:12.418
Now, look.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.878
Well, I'm going to bed.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.839
Well, wait for me, I'm coming.
Don't fall asleep.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.843
- I'll wait for you.
- Bye, baby.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.095
I'll be there soon.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.347
- I'm leaving.
- Okay, Claudia, thanks.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.016
- Bye.
- Good night.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.767
Bye. Good night, Claudia.

29:28.851 --> 29:33.772
Look at that. There it is. Look.
There it is. What happened there?

29:33.856 --> 29:37.818
You ran out of legs. You were running
for nothing. That's what I want.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.904
Get the ball back. Here. Watch this.

29:39.987 --> 29:43.657
- The screen.
- Yes, the screen. Want to see the corners?

29:43.741 --> 29:46.243
- Which ones?
- I have all of them.

29:46.327 --> 29:50.372
No, I don't have them all.
Just the ones that are filmed.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.918
Go on, go on.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.878
The others.

29:57.046 --> 30:01.133
There it goes. No. Diego. Diego.
No! Diego, come back.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.718
- Where? Why?
- Come back!

30:02.801 --> 30:04.678
Don't jump, dodge them.

30:04.762 --> 30:05.971
Which way?

30:06.096 --> 30:08.724
I don't care, whichever way you want.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.643
Look this way, go that way.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.894
Let me play ball!

30:11.977 --> 30:14.438
- Look one way, go the other.
- Come on, man!

30:14.522 --> 30:17.274
You have to drive them crazy.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.651
No, don't... Come here!

30:34.708 --> 30:37.753
My mom used to say,
"If you want to play, play. But study."

30:37.836 --> 30:42.132
I went to med school in the mornings,
trained in San Lorenzo in the afternoon,

30:42.216 --> 30:43.717
and then, studied at night.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.803
- What a sacrifice, Carlos.
- Yes.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.640
I only failed pharmacology.
I'll never forget it. I studied.

30:49.723 --> 30:52.226
Just one question.
The head of department.

30:52.309 --> 30:55.354
He tells me, "I have a man in pain.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.190
Hip operation. What dosage of morphine?"

30:58.274 --> 31:01.360
I state the dosage, he says,
"Go away, you got an F."

31:01.443 --> 31:03.070
"You only asked one question."

31:03.153 --> 31:05.406
"You killed the patient.
No more questions."

31:05.489 --> 31:09.243
And, well, I had to choose
between medicine and soccer.

31:09.743 --> 31:12.204
I asked another doctor,
Chief of cardiology.

31:12.288 --> 31:14.748
I was also doing an internship
in a hospital,

31:14.832 --> 31:16.500
I said, "Doctor, what do I do?"

31:16.584 --> 31:19.295
He said, "How much do you earn?"
"I make 1100 pesos."

31:19.378 --> 31:22.506
"I make 900, carry on with the soccer".
He was right.

31:22.965 --> 31:25.759
Can I ask you a question,
since you're a doctor?

31:25.843 --> 31:28.137
There are a lot of rumors about Diego.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.055
When you see him...

31:31.140 --> 31:32.391
Do you think...

31:33.892 --> 31:36.228
Do you think Diego is using cocaine?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.773
- Don't listen to rumors, Claudia.
- I know.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.483
People do harm. Don't...

31:41.609 --> 31:44.236
I know, but if I ask him, he'll say no.

31:44.320 --> 31:50.242
No, of course, he's going to tell you no.
Look, for example. See? The bathroom.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.786
The boys in the bathroom.
They are waiting.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.539
Are they all going to pee? No.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.082
See? One comes out.

31:57.166 --> 32:01.128
And they all greet each other.
This one is as high as a kite.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.048
- Exactly.
- It's my brother-in-law, Morsa.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.883
No, not him. He may have a cold.

32:05.966 --> 32:08.927
But the ones over there, I mean those.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.848
No, not him. There he is, see?
They're having fun.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.768
Healthy fun with the family.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.522
- Dancing.
- I'll go pee.

32:20.606 --> 32:24.693
Well. Maybe he's going to pee.
They're not all going for the same.

32:25.778 --> 32:29.156
Now, this one coming out now, yes.
Look at his face.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.118
There he goes.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.578
Is he family, too?

32:34.662 --> 32:35.746
- No.
- Okay.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.167
<i>Welcome to</i>
<i>the Delle Alpi stadium in Turin,</i>

32:40.793 --> 32:46.215
<i>in this Sunday where Juventus plays</i>
<i>against Diego Maradona's Napoli,</i>

32:46.298 --> 32:48.926
<i>while Juventus is</i>
<i>lead by Michele Platini.</i>

32:51.512 --> 32:54.098
<i>The atmosphere is on fire.</i>

32:54.890 --> 32:58.519
<i>Juventus doesn't want to let Napoli win</i>

32:58.644 --> 33:02.356
<i>but we'll see,</i>
<i>Napoli is playing very well this year,</i>

33:02.439 --> 33:04.233
<i>obviously led by...</i>

33:04.692 --> 33:09.530
<i>the incredible talent of the</i>
<i>young Argentinian Diego Armando Maradona,</i>

33:10.114 --> 33:10.989
<i>its captain.</i>

33:18.872 --> 33:20.916
<i>Napoli is getting warmed up,</i>

33:20.999 --> 33:24.253
<i>we also see Diego Armando Maradona</i>
<i>on the field with his team.</i>

33:26.046 --> 33:29.550
<i>We are about to start. Tip-off.</i>

33:30.300 --> 33:32.428
<i>The game has started,</i>

33:33.011 --> 33:34.847
<i>Napoli comes forward,</i>

33:35.180 --> 33:36.724
<i>Maradona, Maradona</i>

33:37.015 --> 33:38.475
<i>Maradona comes forward</i>

33:38.559 --> 33:42.062
<i>he's kicked down on the penalty area</i>
<i>but there is no penalty.</i>

33:45.983 --> 33:47.234
<i>Here, we see him,</i>

33:47.401 --> 33:50.404
<i>incredible goal by Diego Armando Maradona</i>

33:51.405 --> 33:53.699
<i>who's able to overcome the barrier.</i>

33:53.866 --> 33:55.993
<i>The goal keeper couldn't stop it,</i>

33:56.827 --> 34:02.833
<i>Tacconi almost crashed into the left pole</i>
<i>while trying.</i>

34:03.917 --> 34:05.294
<i>Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

34:09.131 --> 34:12.384
<i>The crowd is going crazy</i>
<i>at the Delle Alpi stadium,</i>

34:12.468 --> 34:15.304
<i>in this freezing rainy day in Turin.</i>

34:15.387 --> 34:17.431
<i>Here, we see Diego Armando Maradona,</i>

34:17.556 --> 34:20.976
<i>moves away from two players,</i>
<i>he looks impossible to stop.</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:25.856
<i>He goes down, down, penalty, penalty,</i>
<i>penalty, no.</i>

34:25.939 --> 34:28.150
<i>He says no,</i>

34:28.400 --> 34:34.281
<i>and Napoli's captain gets pretty upset</i>
<i>at the referee's choice to deny him...</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:42.748
There is no sign of improvement.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.250
It seems to be getting worse.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.711
- Do you feel pain?
- Yes.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.546
- Here?
- Yes.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.298
We'll run more tests later.

34:51.381 --> 34:53.967
Meanwhile,
let's ask Professor Giannini's opinion.

34:56.637 --> 34:58.180
Doctor, are you feeling well?

34:58.764 --> 34:59.765
Yes.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.978
- Good morning.
- Good morning, doctor.

35:05.562 --> 35:08.315
So, doctor, can I still be saved?

35:15.531 --> 35:16.949
Is he deaf?

35:18.617 --> 35:21.995
Help me!

35:24.832 --> 35:27.960
What's happening? Everything okay?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.090
Is he crying?

35:33.173 --> 35:36.927
The Professor really cares
about the health of his patients.

35:37.010 --> 35:39.221
I love you very much, Diego.

35:41.098 --> 35:42.808
Do you want an autograph?

35:43.308 --> 35:44.434
Yes.

35:52.943 --> 35:58.156
To my good friend...

36:03.453 --> 36:06.540
Okay, then, professor...

36:09.042 --> 36:10.335
Can I hug you?

36:11.253 --> 36:13.130
Of course you can.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.638
Help, help.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.016
Man!

36:25.350 --> 36:27.477
I'm the one who's in bad shape here!

36:28.562 --> 36:29.980
Just my luck!

36:30.898 --> 36:33.984
"Giannini was diagnosed

36:34.359 --> 36:38.530
with an acute cardiac crisis.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.659
And after 14 hours of hospitalization,

36:43.327 --> 36:44.745
of recovery," it says,

36:45.621 --> 36:47.623
"he was discharged."

36:48.373 --> 36:50.459
The asshole was hospitalized!

36:53.712 --> 36:55.839
Shall we make a toast? To Napoli

36:55.923 --> 36:59.217
and the Neapolitans,
who are crazier than the Argentines.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.429
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:03.472 --> 37:04.514
Cheers.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.649
Renato, another wine bottle.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.109
Salvatore, bring them another.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.487
You're ordering another one?

37:19.863 --> 37:23.158
Renato, why is Maradona
in between those two?

37:23.283 --> 37:24.576
Who the fuck knows them?

37:24.743 --> 37:27.412
Are you kidding?
Don't you get who those people are?

37:27.496 --> 37:29.873
They are from politics, finance, sport...

37:30.207 --> 37:32.084
But they are no match to me.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.505
Sure, you want a wall all to yourself.

37:36.630 --> 37:39.925
I'll cover all the walls if you bring
a championship to Napoli.

37:40.008 --> 37:41.843
I cannot do it by myself, Renato.

37:41.927 --> 37:45.722
I need that Ferlaino
to get some help for me.

37:45.806 --> 37:51.395
We don't need Ferlaino. You are enough.
We don't need anyone else, Diego.

37:52.688 --> 37:56.483
This idiot threatens with a championship.
I'll give him a championship.

37:57.526 --> 37:59.528
Be careful, Diego.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.864
Don't bust my balls, Claudia!
Can't you see that I'm having fun?

38:02.948 --> 38:06.743
- Leave me alone!
- I told you to be careful. See how he is?

38:06.827 --> 38:09.746
He doesn't look well.
He's not well and I understand.

38:09.830 --> 38:13.875
There are a lot of changes for him.
He changed his agent, his club,

38:13.959 --> 38:15.293
but he doesn't look well.

38:15.377 --> 38:19.256
The girlfriend is always the same.
And he has the best one.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.467
- Is he doing cocaine?
- Claudia.

38:22.551 --> 38:26.221
Tell me the truth. Is that it?
Tell me, so I can help him.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.600
No. No. Claudia.

38:33.145 --> 38:36.815
I always saw you as a perfect girlfriend.

38:36.898 --> 38:40.235
You're great, you don't pressure him.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.530
You come to see him,
you stay a little while,

38:43.613 --> 38:46.783
you go back to Buenos Aires
and leave him...

38:46.867 --> 38:49.244
In love. That's the way it should be.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.872
What, you think it is
a tactic that I use?

38:51.955 --> 38:54.583
He wants to be alone,
I don't want to leave.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.088
For me... For me, you two...

39:01.256 --> 39:03.925
Listen. You are made for each other.

39:04.968 --> 39:09.806
When I see you two together, I see love.

39:11.183 --> 39:13.060
True love.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.938
You've been together
since you were very young.

39:17.022 --> 39:17.981
Yes.

39:18.106 --> 39:21.818
And, perhaps,
at this moment, when Diego is

39:23.070 --> 39:26.490
under so much pressure.
With a lot of demand,

39:27.199 --> 39:29.201
because of what's expected of him,

39:30.744 --> 39:36.750
he needs it to distract himself, to relax.
Don't look at me like that.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.586
You know what I mean?

39:39.669 --> 39:43.006
Yes, I understand, I have to play dumb,
so he can go and party.

39:43.090 --> 39:47.010
It is not something
that Diego told me. It's my opinion.

39:47.094 --> 39:51.389
But I think that when you go
to Buenos Aires, Diego is on his own,

39:53.308 --> 39:57.646
he is less prone to injuries,
better at work, in a better mood.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.982
He looks like a different guy.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.575
Stop.

40:15.789 --> 40:18.041
- Shall we eat dessert?
- Another toast.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.838
- What happened?
- Oh, no.

40:25.674 --> 40:26.716
Diego!

40:26.800 --> 40:29.761
Hi, girl, how are you? Good? Good.

40:29.928 --> 40:32.305
- How are you, good?
- How are you? Hi, Diego, hi.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.099
Can we ask you for your autograph?

40:34.182 --> 40:38.186
- Yes. Give it to me. Where do I sign?
- Here, Diego.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.522
I'm Diego's manager.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.399
All right.

40:42.482 --> 40:45.068
- Don't you go and sell them.
- No.

40:45.235 --> 40:49.698
My girlfriend is too miserly.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.158
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

40:51.241 --> 40:54.661
She only cares about money.

40:54.744 --> 40:57.289
Yes, a cheapskate,
but that's why we have savings.

40:57.372 --> 40:58.957
- Do you work as models?
- Yes.

40:59.040 --> 41:03.378
- Yeah, it looks like it.
- It was a pleasure. Let's go now, girls.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.463
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.718
Here, my girlfriend.

41:09.801 --> 41:13.305
- Yes.
- She's cheap and she saves

41:13.388 --> 41:18.435
all the money that falls down,
she picks it up.

41:19.728 --> 41:22.397
- Shut up!
- She has a fortune!

41:22.480 --> 41:25.609
She didn't have a piggy bank,
she had a rhino bank.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.736
- You lie!
- Yeah, sure.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.324
- Okay, baby.
- Okay, what?

41:32.407 --> 41:34.743
- I'll see you at home.
- Where are you going?

41:34.826 --> 41:37.621
We have to meet up with
the Lamborghini people.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.998
They want to see Diego to do business.

41:40.081 --> 41:40.999
At this hour?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.626
- To go for a drink.
- Crazy.

41:42.709 --> 41:43.835
You didn't mention it.

41:43.919 --> 41:46.421
- It's business, baby.
- Bye, Claudia.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.839
Bye, I love you.

41:47.923 --> 41:49.216
- Me, too.
- I'll be quick.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.092
- You'll come early?
- Yes.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.011
I'll wait up for you.

41:53.094 --> 41:54.262
Hurry.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.722
- Hurry back.
- Love you.

41:55.805 --> 41:57.182
Why didn't you tell me?

41:57.265 --> 41:58.391
It's business.

42:13.698 --> 42:19.704
<i>He thinks that the fence is only</i>
<i>A piece of metal</i>

42:21.748 --> 42:25.543
<i>Something that can never stop</i>

42:25.627 --> 42:29.089
<i>His longing to fly</i>

42:29.965 --> 42:31.549
<i>Free</i>

42:31.633 --> 42:34.928
<i>Like the Sun at dawn</i>

42:35.011 --> 42:39.766
<i>I am free as the sea</i>

42:40.684 --> 42:42.477
<i>Free</i>

42:42.560 --> 42:46.731
<i>Like the bird that escaped from its prison</i>

42:46.815 --> 42:51.069
<i>And can, at last, fly</i>

42:51.194 --> 42:53.488
<i>Free</i>

42:53.571 --> 42:59.536
<i>Like the air that clouds my lamentation</i>
<i>And my sorrow</i>

43:00.662 --> 43:05.792
<i>I walk unceasingly</i>
<i>Behind the truth</i>

43:05.875 --> 43:11.881
<i>And at last I'll know what freedom is</i>

43:22.225 --> 43:23.351
Come on, man!

43:23.435 --> 43:25.812
Nobody will believe what we lived tonight.

43:25.895 --> 43:26.855
Come on!

43:26.938 --> 43:28.315
You're so pretty.

43:30.150 --> 43:32.277
Hey, come here.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.822
Come here, come here.
Darling, how are you?

43:37.115 --> 43:38.533
I'm going crazy.

43:42.120 --> 43:43.955
Guille, I can't stop.

44:03.433 --> 44:05.268
Long live Napoli!

44:18.239 --> 44:20.283
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

44:20.742 --> 44:22.535
<i>Oh, Mom</i>

44:23.203 --> 44:26.581
<i>You know why my heart beats?</i>

44:26.956 --> 44:30.710
<i>Because I saw Maradona</i>
<i>I saw Maradona</i>

44:31.086 --> 44:34.130
<i>Hey, Mom, I'm in love</i>

44:34.422 --> 44:38.218
<i>Oh, Mom, Mom, Mom</i>

44:38.343 --> 44:41.679
<i>You know why my heart beats?</i>

44:41.763 --> 44:45.725
<i>Because I saw Maradona</i>
<i>I saw Maradona</i>

44:45.850 --> 44:48.895
<i>Hey, Mom, I'm in love</i>

45:23.972 --> 45:26.182
Maradona, take one, it's hot.

45:26.266 --> 45:27.684
- Yes?
- Yes.

45:37.944 --> 45:42.073
<i>Free</i>
<i>Like the Sun at dawn</i>

45:42.157 --> 45:47.120
<i>I am free as the sea</i>

45:48.037 --> 45:49.622
<i>Free</i>

45:50.039 --> 45:54.752
<i>Like the bird that escaped from its prison</i>

45:54.836 --> 45:57.672
<i>And can, at last, fly</i>

45:58.214 --> 45:59.757
<i>Free</i>

46:00.925 --> 46:06.931
<i>Like the air that clouds my lamentation</i>
<i>And my sorrow</i>

46:07.891 --> 46:10.727
<i>I walk unceasingly</i>

46:10.810 --> 46:13.146
<i>Behind the truth</i>

46:13.897 --> 46:19.861
<i>And at last I'll know what freedom is</i>

46:28.495 --> 46:32.749
- You think?
- Like a character...

46:33.291 --> 46:37.003
Stop. You could run back to Buenos Aires,
what are you running from?

46:37.629 --> 46:39.047
Stop, stop.

46:41.758 --> 46:43.551
They're all the same.

46:44.052 --> 46:46.262
They never change.

46:46.596 --> 46:49.891
They swear they're looking at your shoes.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.727
But they're looking at your cleavage.

46:55.980 --> 46:58.441
What matters
is that they always come home.

46:58.525 --> 47:00.276
And one waits for them, how?

47:01.903 --> 47:05.698
- With paradise served on a silver plate.
- I don't know.

47:05.782 --> 47:09.244
Yes, that's the way to keep them.
Of course it is.

47:09.786 --> 47:12.997
Claudia, we don't compete with lovers.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.333
We compete with the mother.

47:17.043 --> 47:19.796
Look at Guillermo,
for example, so charming,

47:19.879 --> 47:23.800
all the time with everybody,
what can I do? Change him now?

47:23.883 --> 47:25.843
No way. Forget it.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.847
His secretary drives him crazy.

47:30.598 --> 47:35.186
The office chairs cost a lot of money,
and she sits on his lap all day.

47:39.983 --> 47:41.067
I'm hungry.

47:42.569 --> 47:43.861
Shall we eat?

47:51.995 --> 47:54.289
- Hi, Juana.
- Good morning, madam.

47:58.459 --> 48:00.753
Give me a glass. Thanks.

48:05.300 --> 48:06.718
Is Diego home?

48:06.801 --> 48:08.720
Yes, madam, an hour ago.

48:23.860 --> 48:24.777
Diego.

48:26.279 --> 48:27.447
Wake up.

48:29.282 --> 48:30.450
Diego.

48:30.533 --> 48:31.534
No.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.372
You have to go to training.

48:37.415 --> 48:40.043
You missed last week,
you can't miss it again.

48:40.126 --> 48:43.755
Stop busting my balls, Claudia.
I'm a big boy. Leave me alone.

49:10.239 --> 49:11.240
Hi, Juana.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.952
Morning, sir.
Would you like coffee with milk?

49:16.079 --> 49:18.122
Yes, more coffee than milk, please.

49:19.499 --> 49:20.458
Where's Claudia?

49:20.792 --> 49:21.959
She went out.

49:23.211 --> 49:26.047
- Did she tell you where?
- To Argentina.

49:27.507 --> 49:29.258
To Argentina?

49:29.342 --> 49:32.345
She was mad
because you wouldn't wake up, sir.

49:33.471 --> 49:37.141
She packed her bags while you slept,
and went back to Argentina.

49:38.393 --> 49:40.978
What's wrong with her? It's00 p.m.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.773
It's Wednesday, sir.

49:47.944 --> 49:49.320
Wednesday?

49:49.821 --> 49:51.989
Yes, you slept more than 24 hours.

49:59.539 --> 50:04.210
I met Diego Maradona in prison,
when Guillermo Coppola was in jail,

50:04.293 --> 50:08.715
when he had been planted with drugs,
with the vase and the dodgy judge stuff.

50:08.798 --> 50:11.467
I helped Guillermo a lot inside,

50:11.551 --> 50:15.179
and Diego went
to visit him often and, well,

50:15.263 --> 50:21.227
that's when we became very good friends.
It was what I call love at first sniff.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.273
I knew nothing about soccer. Nothing.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.066
Don't even know the ball's shape.

50:27.150 --> 50:28.776
I think Diego loved me for that.

50:28.860 --> 50:32.530
I took him away from the soccer topic,
that had him so fed up.

50:32.613 --> 50:36.159
The guy was sick of it all,
the best player in the world.

50:36.242 --> 50:40.246
A great guy,
a wonderful father, the best father.

50:40.329 --> 50:43.875
In Punta, we were in a mansion,
and there was a cabin at the back

50:43.958 --> 50:48.254
where we would go to get high, so,
the girls wouldn't see us. Great father.

50:48.337 --> 50:51.048
He and Claudia were separated.
She acted like a wife.

50:51.132 --> 50:56.554
And what I don't understand is why
everyone was trying to convince Diego

50:56.637 --> 50:58.681
that he was bankrupt.

50:58.765 --> 51:03.978
Meanwhile, Claudia was saving
for the girls. But, you see,

51:04.437 --> 51:06.272
Claudia is smart.

51:06.355 --> 51:08.191
I have plenty of anecdotes.

51:08.274 --> 51:09.400
One night,

51:10.485 --> 51:12.570
after partying hard,

51:12.653 --> 51:14.822
I heard Diego breathing heavily.

51:14.906 --> 51:17.366
A dry, permanent cough,
I don't know, anyway.

51:17.450 --> 51:20.661
We went in the van together
to a drugstore to buy medicine,

51:20.745 --> 51:24.832
and that's when we screwed up
because I gave the bottle to Diego,

51:24.916 --> 51:27.752
he took off the cap and down the hatch.

51:27.835 --> 51:30.546
It was a big jar.
I think that was the final straw.

51:30.630 --> 51:31.923
Wait, Ferro, stop.

51:32.590 --> 51:35.802
Do you feel a little responsible
for what happened to Diego?

51:35.885 --> 51:37.553
Not responsible,

51:37.678 --> 51:41.849
because, I mean, we were both adults,

51:42.475 --> 51:47.730
both of age and besides, you can't tell
Diego what to do, he'll do the opposite.

51:47.814 --> 51:49.982
Of course.

51:50.525 --> 51:53.277
And besides, honestly,

51:53.402 --> 51:54.987
I couldn't take care of Diego

51:55.071 --> 51:57.990
because sometimes,
I was in a worse state than him.

53:04.807 --> 53:07.518
Were you up when Guillermo
arrived with Pelusa?

53:08.185 --> 53:10.271
Yes, they came back in the morning.

53:12.607 --> 53:14.483
Did you see them go to bed together?

53:14.567 --> 53:18.070
They were walking hugging each other,
so they wouldn't fall.

53:20.364 --> 53:21.866
I don't want trouble.

53:21.991 --> 53:24.410
I was told that Claudia was my employer.

53:25.369 --> 53:26.787
Diego is your employer.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.081
Come with me.

53:38.341 --> 53:40.551
- Are you sure you don't want one?
- No.

53:40.635 --> 53:42.511
- It's the last one.
- It's yours.

53:45.681 --> 53:47.350
Claudia left,

53:48.559 --> 53:52.021
this one arrived.
They're always together, like a couple.

53:55.441 --> 53:58.194
If Pelusa is a faggot,
your father will die.

53:58.277 --> 53:59.695
Mom, what are you saying?

54:01.822 --> 54:04.158
Tell her what you saw the other day.

54:04.325 --> 54:05.451
Mrs. Tota.

54:05.534 --> 54:06.786
Tell her.

54:07.745 --> 54:10.373
The other day, Mr. Diego and Mr. Guillermo

54:10.456 --> 54:14.126
were with some friends and they kissed.
On the mouth.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.630
I don't know, they were joking, I think.

54:17.713 --> 54:20.800
Don't be ridiculous.
Diego is a soccer player.

54:21.175 --> 54:23.094
Homosexuals don't play soccer.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.304
Go and see them sleeping together.

54:27.515 --> 54:30.643
Diego loves women. Too much.

54:30.726 --> 54:34.730
Do you know who he asked me about
the other day? My Italian friend.

54:36.691 --> 54:38.818
- Which one?
- The blond one.

54:40.111 --> 54:41.487
The one that sells panties?

54:45.533 --> 54:46.701
She's cute.

54:48.536 --> 54:49.704
<i>Mrs. Claudia.</i>

54:50.621 --> 54:53.541
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yes.

55:00.715 --> 55:02.717
I did something I should've never done.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.178
I feel bad.

55:08.681 --> 55:12.351
It's horrible to take advantage
of someone who was helpless.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.564
But I swear I didn't...

55:17.648 --> 55:18.649
I didn't think.

55:20.276 --> 55:23.779
The doctors said he wasn't gonna make it.

55:25.823 --> 55:30.911
So, I wanted to keep some of his things.

55:31.871 --> 55:34.874
At the time,
I didn't feel like I was stealing.

55:35.666 --> 55:40.337
But now, that he woke up,
I realize that I was.

55:41.881 --> 55:46.469
Even if they were just things
that I wanted to keep as souvenirs.

55:52.558 --> 55:54.226
I appreciate you telling me.

55:55.436 --> 55:57.104
And that you gave them back.

55:59.356 --> 56:01.275
But what you did is very wrong.

56:03.611 --> 56:06.155
If you want to report me, I understand.

56:08.282 --> 56:10.284
I will continue to admire you.

56:12.078 --> 56:13.454
For your fortitude,

56:14.663 --> 56:16.665
for how you support your family.

56:18.459 --> 56:20.127
You are a very good person.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.632
You are a great woman, Claudia.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.307
Sorry, I forgot this one.

57:07.758 --> 57:11.554
- Why are you here? Weren't you leaving?
- I am. Did the girl come?

57:11.637 --> 57:15.474
- That's why you're hanging around here.
- I'm worried, honey.

57:15.558 --> 57:18.435
Worry about me 10%
of what you worry about him.

57:18.519 --> 57:19.603
You don't need me.

57:19.687 --> 57:21.147
Did you introduce them?

57:21.230 --> 57:22.731
No, she just arrived.

57:22.815 --> 57:25.401
Look at your son, playing with a cork.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.532
Don't worry, they'll meet today.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.242
Let's eat!

57:49.008 --> 57:50.718
Careful, you almost hurt me.

57:50.843 --> 57:53.596
Sorry, I didn't see you.

57:53.929 --> 57:56.515
But you were looking at me
in the photo <i>.</i>

57:56.765 --> 57:59.018
Actually, I was looking at the frame.

57:59.602 --> 58:02.146
It's crooked, look. It bothers me.

58:02.563 --> 58:03.689
It's not crooked.

58:05.816 --> 58:07.860
It's not crooked now. Before, it was.

58:10.362 --> 58:11.530
I didn't notice.

58:11.906 --> 58:14.408
You didn't notice, because you're crooked.

58:16.619 --> 58:19.747
You are too drunk to see it,
but my eyes never fail.

58:21.290 --> 58:22.249
Neither do mine.

58:34.303 --> 58:35.429
Maradona.

58:36.388 --> 58:37.848
I did your last name.

58:38.849 --> 58:39.850
Gross, Morsa.

58:39.934 --> 58:42.061
You like my friends, I can tell.

58:43.562 --> 58:44.939
Yes. What's her story?

58:45.022 --> 58:48.484
She's great, humble,
she's the hairdresser's daughter.

58:48.567 --> 58:49.401
Really?

58:49.485 --> 58:52.529
I met her because
her best friend is seeing Hugo.

58:52.655 --> 58:54.073
Hugo's dating?

58:55.032 --> 58:56.367
The kid's fast.

58:56.450 --> 58:58.702
Shall I introduce you?
Can you do it alone?

58:58.786 --> 59:01.121
Of course I can. Who do you think I am?

59:01.538 --> 59:04.792
Don't play with the cork,
she doesn't care about soccer.

59:07.544 --> 59:09.296
Go for it, goal scorer!

59:19.056 --> 59:22.476
So? Did you find
any other crooked picture frames?

59:24.270 --> 59:25.104
No.

59:25.813 --> 59:29.900
I started to drink water because
if I didn't, everything would go crooked.

59:34.029 --> 59:35.656
Did you come with someone?

59:38.742 --> 59:39.952
Do you have a boyfriend?

59:41.370 --> 59:42.288
No.

59:45.124 --> 59:46.709
I'm Diego.

59:46.875 --> 59:48.043
Diego Maradona.

59:48.502 --> 59:49.670
Cristiana Sinagra.

59:56.552 --> 1:00:01.223
In order to comply with the exclusivity
that Diego demanded of him

1:00:01.307 --> 1:00:05.644
Guillermo Coppola had to give up
the management of more than 200 players.

1:00:07.271 --> 1:00:13.027
Among them were world champions
and figures of international renown

1:00:13.110 --> 1:00:16.363
such as Fillol, Gatti and Brindisi.

1:00:18.282 --> 1:00:20.951
During his stay in Naples,
Maradona's brother-in-law,

1:00:21.035 --> 1:00:24.204
Gabriel "Morsa" Esposito, acted
as a link between pickpockets

1:00:24.288 --> 1:00:25.456
and Argentine tourists.

1:00:25.539 --> 1:00:28.083
He demanded compensation
in exchange for passports.

1:00:29.251 --> 1:00:34.006
Diego Armando Maradona,
even in his worst moments,

1:00:34.131 --> 1:00:38.886
out of shape and overweight, stood out
for his extraordinary skill with the ball.

1:00:40.554 --> 1:00:42.723
My strength is my legs,

1:00:42.806 --> 1:00:45.434
but also being strong up top,

1:00:45.517 --> 1:00:48.771
it's winning a challenge to get ahead.

1:01:22.554 --> 1:01:27.351
I earn what my contract entails,
my soccer contract.

1:01:27.434 --> 1:01:32.648
Then what I earn from
publicity and the rest,

1:01:34.316 --> 1:01:39.613
I don't put it in the bank
because I like the fine life.

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:43.492
I like living good, buying nice cars,

1:01:43.575 --> 1:01:47.704
I like giving my family
what they deserve...
