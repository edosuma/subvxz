WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:04.713
What?

00:05.171 --> 00:06.589
Your heart is beating really fast.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.216
You're sure you don't want me to come?

00:08.216 --> 00:11.469
It's more like a college reunion
than an actual engagement party.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.681
- Can I tell you something? Sort of secret.
- Sorry.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.934
Do you want to come out?
I'll be the boring designated driver.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.602
Yeah,
I think I'm just going to stay in tonight.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.063
I can't imagine what I would do right now
if you were wearing a skirt.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.526
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.696
- That's Stephen's girlfriend.
- Ex-girlfriend.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.949
This other car came out of nowhere.
I swerved at the last minute

00:33.324 --> 00:35.660
and so, did they,
I didn't know it was Macy.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.747
Nobody knows what you just told me,
except for us.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.016
You got stage fright, kid?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.852
I'm good.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.939
As long as you didn't swallow, smoke,
snort or shoot anything,

01:05.190 --> 01:06.441
you got nothing to worry about.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.736
I'm not... I'm not worried.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.654
Then do me a favor,

01:12.072 --> 01:14.866
don't be like your teammates. Try and aim.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.501
How that rest plan go this week?

01:25.001 --> 01:25.877
It was great.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.879
How many days did you sit out
of practice?

01:28.671 --> 01:30.090
Oh, you know...

01:30.757 --> 01:31.633
none.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.011
You're going to fuck up your knee
long-term,

01:35.095 --> 01:36.304
if you don't take this seriously.

01:37.972 --> 01:39.557
After this game, I swear.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.437
Let's at least make sure
you're comfortable then.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.941
We'll do another cortisone shot
and wrap it up.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.360
Yeah. Yep, sounds good.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.302
Pussy.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.273
I've never seen you open a book
this early.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.984
Mid-terms,
sort of snuck up on me this year, so...

03:13.401 --> 03:15.653
You're so serious when you study,
you're like...

03:21.659 --> 03:22.869
What am I supposed to do?

03:23.661 --> 03:24.787
I don't know.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.000
Maybe just like...
don't study.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.712
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, God. Stop,

03:32.879 --> 03:35.381
- stop, stop.
- I'm good.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.135
- Okay, get off me, I can't breathe.
- I can't move, I'm asleep.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.597
Stop.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.383
Feels so good.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.198
I wish I could fuck you all day.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.702
- Oh, shit.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.873
Shit, I'm going be late for class.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.042
You actually go to class?

04:53.251 --> 04:55.878
Yes, attendance is 20 percent of my grade.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.090
A rule follower? I had no idea.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.302
Yeah, well, there's a lot
you don't know about me.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.471
I know what you taste like.

05:11.519 --> 05:15.732
- I like making you uncomfortable.
- I'm not uncomfortable.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.365
No offense to Lucy,
but I couldn't really get into this story.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.285
I know you're supposed to be rooting
for the Liz character,

05:27.410 --> 05:30.580
but I actually found myself rooting
for Parker instead.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.917
Same, she was so cold to him.
It didn't feel realistic.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.171
Well, Parker represents everything
in Liz's life that was suffocating her.

05:38.296 --> 05:39.339
But still,

05:39.839 --> 05:41.758
nobody acts like that unless
you're a sociopath.

05:46.054 --> 05:47.930
Lucy, what do you say to that?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.767
I don't know, I guess I would say,
it sounds more like a criticism

05:50.767 --> 05:52.602
of the character
than of my actual writing.

05:52.727 --> 05:56.606
Except that she's your protagonist.
And a part of writing is making the reader

05:56.606 --> 05:58.066
care what happens to her.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.902
Well, I don't think Liz intentionally
shut off her feelings.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.321
I just couldn't really connect with her.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.490
Yeah,
what am I supposed to feel at the end?

06:05.490 --> 06:06.783
I can't figure out the takeaway.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.534
She just seems like really mean.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.869
It seems like she just doesn't have

06:09.994 --> 06:12.330
any feelings, and I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to care

06:12.497 --> 06:13.873
about someone like that.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.462
- Lucy?
- Yeah.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.839
Any other thoughts to share?

06:24.634 --> 06:26.260
No, no. Thank you.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.472
All right.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.777
Hey.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.737
Drew, Drew!

06:48.658 --> 06:49.742
Hey!

06:50.827 --> 06:51.869
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.746
Hello.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.375
You look like shit. Are... are you sick?

06:58.334 --> 06:59.377
Just tired.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.963
You forget how to answer your phone, asshole?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.339
Sorry.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.799
Hey.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.345
Remember what Stephen said.
"This only goes away if you let it."

07:10.138 --> 07:11.347
It's never going to go away.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.474
What's that mean?

07:15.393 --> 07:16.561
It's nothing.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.440
I'm fine, it's fine. I got class.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.901
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait,
hold on, hold on.

07:26.654 --> 07:29.991
- You're coming out with me tomorrow.
- I don't know, maybe.

07:30.241 --> 07:33.119
- Yes, you are, you're coming.
- Why does this matter?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.580
Because you're really depressing
the shit out of me right now, man.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.664
I don't like it.

07:36.831 --> 07:41.210
- Okay. Fine, I'll... I'll come.
- Good, okay, we'll have fun.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.634
I'm posting your grades tonight.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.471
Three of you achieved a perfect score.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.056
Diana Linder,

07:54.599 --> 07:56.434
Adam Rogers, and...

07:57.268 --> 07:58.603
Stephen DeMarco.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.813
Congratulations.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.317
And, one more thing,
I am looking for a research assistant.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.319
You'll be credited
and the job will go until next summer.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.820
If you are interested,

08:08.154 --> 08:11.324
pick up an application on your way out.
You're all dismissed, thank you,

08:11.449 --> 08:13.034
and good luck on your mid-terms.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.287
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.297
Good, good, thanks. Here we are.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.764
Mr. DeMarco.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.558
Will I have a better chance
if I don't put my name on this?

08:37.850 --> 08:38.893
Please, put your name on it.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.106
Wrigley, come in and take a seat.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.900
Solid game.

08:46.192 --> 08:50.196
But you guys really turned it around.
All right, you know the drill.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.989
Give me three good things, let's go.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.908
Just say whatever comes to your head.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.287
- I got a cortisone shot in my knee.
- That's a good thing?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.749
- Helps the pain.
- Okay, that's one, give me two.

09:02.792 --> 09:06.087
Coach said I'm up for the captain,
next year.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.463
I heard.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.424
- That's got to feel good.
- Yeah, yeah, it feels good.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.426
All right, last one.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.308
I'm kind of seeing this girl, I guess.

09:20.142 --> 09:23.729
- You guess? You're not sure?
- No, I'm sure.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.523
I...

09:26.065 --> 09:28.150
I'm seeing this girl and I'm sure, yeah.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.569
That's three, good for you.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.613
All right,
let's talk about mid-terms.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.658
How's studying going?
Any movement on what we talked about?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.493
I feel... I feel good.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.621
Not what I asked.

09:41.414 --> 09:46.377
- I... No, I didn't do it, no.
- You got to work with me on this.

09:46.794 --> 09:48.588
I really don't think this is an issue.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.214
Your professors seem to think it is.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.592
They've been keeping me updated
on your performance...

09:55.261 --> 09:56.470
Wrigley...

09:57.221 --> 09:58.806
you have a learning disability.

09:59.473 --> 10:02.643
There's no reason you should be doing
mid-terms without extended testing time.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.813
So, please, go register
at the disability office,

10:05.938 --> 10:07.773
so you can have extra time on your exams.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.900
It's not that hard, what's the problem?

10:11.360 --> 10:12.903
No problem, no problem.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.614
Then get it done.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.158
Sitting out
because of injury is one thing...

10:18.534 --> 10:20.536
sitting out because you failed a test...

10:21.454 --> 10:22.872
what's everyone going to think about that?

10:25.666 --> 10:27.627
- Dude, he's dead.
- I disagree.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.879
It cut to black, the guy in
the "members only" jacket shot him.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.214
Exactly, it cut to black,
so, we don't actually know what happened.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.549
He could be dead, he could be alive.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.009
- Oh, my God.
- He's... It's Schrodinger's cat.

10:35.009 --> 10:35.968
- What?
- Whose cat?

10:36.260 --> 10:38.262
It's a thought experiment
about quantum physics.

10:38.471 --> 10:42.016
Fuck quantum physics, all right?
Tony Soprano was fucking dead.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.226
- Disagree.
- Oh, my God.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.520
Wrigley, please talk some sense
in to this man.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.564
- You guys took Econ 101, right?
- Yeah.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.734
- Any chance you can help me study later?
- Can't, I got to finish this paper.

10:54.528 --> 10:58.032
I have an application to finish.
Plus, I don't have the 12 hours

10:58.282 --> 11:00.284
it's going to take to get you through
the fucking material.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.579
Watching Wrigley try to read,
it's... it's like, watching someone take

11:03.746 --> 11:05.081
their first shit after surgery.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.834
Sorry.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.672
Whatever, man.

11:13.297 --> 11:15.341
All right. Got to go, guys.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.179
Yo.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.722
You, all right?

11:22.306 --> 11:23.349
I'm good.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.143
Something with Drew? You need my help?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.979
No, man, everything's good. Thanks.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.329
- You are not going to believe this.
- Pippa, stop.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.456
What?
You should be proud of this.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.292
- Okay, are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.419
Oh.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.295
Holy shit. What happened to you?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.631
It's nothing.
Something just irritated my skin, I think.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.217
It looks like a bear
tried to claw your tits off.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.554
Are you okay?
I've got some cortisone cream in our room,

12:01.554 --> 12:02.722
if you want some.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.765
No, I'm fine. I'm... What...
what were you going to tell me?

12:06.392 --> 12:07.560
Okay.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.397
Our little Bree-Bree, our beautiful,
innocent little virgin

12:12.106 --> 12:13.649
is going to be a nude model.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.235
For art class.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.113
I've done it before, it's decent money.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.157
Yeah, it's just like a weird job.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.201
Says someone who's never had a job.

12:24.869 --> 12:28.122
At my first high school,
our principal's wife was our model

12:28.122 --> 12:29.749
and it was so fucking awkward.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.667
First high school? You had more than one?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I transferred, senior year.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.339
- I can use this, right?
- You did? Why?

12:37.965 --> 12:41.093
My school didn't offer
enough AP classes, so, I transferred.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.262
Must have sucked,
transferring senior year.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.723
It was fine.
So, what are we wearing

12:45.848 --> 12:48.058
to that whole neon jungle party
thing tomorrow?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.351
I think that's for upper-classmen.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.854
Yeah, Wrigley inviting me.
Aren't you going with Stephen?

12:52.480 --> 12:53.731
No, he didn't mention it to me.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.693
- Well, I'm sure I can get guys an invite.
- It's fine.

12:57.860 --> 13:01.572
- Go, go with your famous boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.741
You're with him every night.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.410
Yeah, because he gives me
the best orgasms of my life.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.204
So, you said.

13:09.079 --> 13:11.207
I'm just having fun.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.337
Anyway, that's it. That's the news,
now you know.

13:16.337 --> 13:19.131
- Read it and weep, bye.
- Okay, bye.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.395
- You're fucking amazing.

13:37.608 --> 13:41.529
- Where are you going?
- To pee so I don't get a UTI.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.538
Have you seen my hair tie?

13:52.998 --> 13:53.999
Yeah.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.461
Here.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.385
- It's not mine.
- What do you mean?

14:06.220 --> 14:07.763
I mean it's not my hair tie.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.642
Okay. Some other girl
probably left it here,

14:11.767 --> 14:15.271
- Allie or someone.
- What was it? Allie or was it someone?

14:16.355 --> 14:17.523
Why are you being weird right now?

14:17.773 --> 14:19.608
- I'm not being weird.
- You are.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.776
No, I'm not.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.611
It's a hair tie.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.031
I'm not...
I'm not sleeping with anyone else.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.534
Neither am I.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.871
Okay, s... sorry, I got confused.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.498
It wouldn't bother me if you did though.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.920
- It wouldn't... It wouldn't?
- Hmm?

14:40.838 --> 14:42.798
It's your freshman year
and I know you just got out

14:42.923 --> 14:44.216
of a relationship.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.594
You should be having fun
and I wouldn't want to ruin that.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.012
You're not.

14:50.180 --> 14:54.226
You're so independent.
That's why I'm attracted to you.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.896
So, are... are you sleeping
with other people?

14:58.522 --> 14:59.481
No,

15:00.107 --> 15:01.317
not right now.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.402
Hey.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.406
I like hanging out with you, a lot.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.452
I like hanging out with you too, a lot.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.622
Good.

15:20.794 --> 15:21.837
Okay.

15:29.303 --> 15:33.015
- What do you want? Yeah?
- I... Whatever you want.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.602
- Move over. Yeah.
- Okay. Oh, my God. Okay.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
Oh, God.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.488
Oh, shit.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.157
Oh, fuck.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.619
- Do you like this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.999
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit, I'm going to come.
- Yeah. Oh, my God. Me too, I'm so close.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.751
Fuck, I'm going to come.
I'm going to come... come.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.273
- Really like having sex with you.
- You do?

16:24.191 --> 16:26.610
Yeah. Why do you think I keep doing it?

16:27.528 --> 16:30.030
No, I mean, yeah. I'm like, pretty great.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.967
Are you sure I should go
to this party tonight?

16:50.175 --> 16:51.760
I'm going to be the only freshman there.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.680
What? Yeah, you're going to be with me.

16:55.055 --> 16:56.724
And Drew's going to be there,
he's a freshman.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.351
Can I ask you a question about Drew?

17:02.312 --> 17:03.397
Yeah, what's up?

17:04.148 --> 17:08.402
Did you ever ask him why he bailed
on Bree during Welcome Week?

17:12.197 --> 17:14.408
He's having really hard time
adjusting to school.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.536
But that was like before school started.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.998
Like, one night he's making out with her,

17:21.331 --> 17:23.584
and on the next night,
he just like totally not feeling it...

17:23.709 --> 17:26.503
Yeah, that's Drew's business, honestly.
Bree shouldn't take it that personally.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.671
It's not like they fucked.

17:28.380 --> 17:29.339
Okay.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.983
- Hey.
- What are you up to now?

17:50.819 --> 17:53.363
Nothing, I'm... I'm going to library.
I'm going to study.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.450
You never study in the library.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.494
Yeah, sometimes I do.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.246
Okay.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.665
- Cool.
- Yeah.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.313
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.608
Is this where I go for the testing stuff,
the extended time?

18:29.733 --> 18:32.861
- It is. Do you need a form?
- No, I've... I've got one.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.447
- You can take a seat.
- Yeah, yeah, thank you.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.266
Yo, Wriggy.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.852
- Hey, man. Hey. Yeah.
- Bring it in, man!

19:05.227 --> 19:06.311
Hey.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.399
What are you... what are you doing here?

19:10.899 --> 19:12.901
I have difficulty multi-tasking.

19:13.944 --> 19:16.321
So much cheaper than buying Adderall
from my roommate.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.907
I'd rather let them think I'm retarded.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.786
- Right, same.
- Anyway. See you later.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.913
Yeah, see you.

19:39.219 --> 19:42.139
So, where did you guys decide
to go out tonight?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.766
We're going to George's
to test out our new fakes.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.351
Oh! What? No.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.022
- Now, dammit, I'm jealous.
- Come with us.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.691
Yeah, I'm not going to miss
the neon jungle party.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.234
It's going to be sick.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.032
I just mean, Wrigley begged me to go,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.993
otherwise I would definitely
go out with you guys.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.870
Okay, there.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.041
Hey, did Wrigley say anything
about Stephen going to the party tonight?

20:09.208 --> 20:12.002
No, he didn't mention anything,
but I'm sure he's not going.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.962
Otherwise,
he definitely would've invited you.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.216
Honestly, I don't even know why I care.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.510
Because you like him. It's okay, just...

20:21.220 --> 20:23.597
maybe try being honest with him.

20:23.972 --> 20:27.267
What? No. Worse advice ever.

20:27.684 --> 20:28.852
Why?

20:29.853 --> 20:33.065
Of course, somewhere inside,
maybe you care about him.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.651
But other people don't need to know
that and he definitely doesn't need

20:35.817 --> 20:37.736
to know that.
This goes for all guys.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.279
The second they know
you give a shit,

20:39.404 --> 20:43.450
- your stock goes down like 30 percent.
- That's ridiculous, you sound ridiculous.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.664
Okay, look. I know
Wrigley's still texting other girls,

20:48.664 --> 20:49.998
but I'm in his bed every night.

20:50.082 --> 20:54.753
And you know why? Because unlike them,
I act like I don't give a shit.

20:55.045 --> 20:58.757
- Isn't that exhausting?
- It is, but that's just the way it goes.

20:59.132 --> 21:02.886
No, you're right. You're right.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.012
I need to not care.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.848
- Yes. Okay, good.
- I don't give a fuck.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.269
- Exactly.
- No fucks, actually.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.020
- No fucks.
- No fucks.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.191
- Bree.
- I didn't give a fuck to begin with, so...

21:16.275 --> 21:17.526
- There you go.
- To no fucks.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.032
- I kind of give a fuck.
- No.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.326
But just a little fuck,
just a little fuck. Just a little fuck.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.620
- No. No! No! No!
- No.

21:34.376 --> 21:35.669
Aren't you glad you came now?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.422
I'mma go get another drink.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.385
Hey, is he okay?
He seems kind of out of it.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.931
Yeah, he's just high, probably.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.975
- Okay.
- Hello.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.395
- Hey.
- Hey, you're not allowed to ignore me

21:53.520 --> 21:56.064
- just because Stephen tells you to.
- I would never.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.608
- You're Pippa, right?
- Yeah.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.985
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.113
- Nice meeting you.
- Yo, that game was insane.

22:04.364 --> 22:07.492
- Yeah, it was a close one, for sure.
- Come take a body shot.

22:07.701 --> 22:08.952
Ah...

22:09.953 --> 22:11.496
- I'm down.
- Cool.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.082
Yeah, you want to do a body shot?

22:15.542 --> 22:16.626
Are you coming?

22:18.420 --> 22:19.463
Yeah.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.798
- Yeah, let's do it.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.261
Is everything okay with you, though?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.263
Yeah, why?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.474
You broke out in hives yesterday,

22:31.224 --> 22:32.351
I get them, too.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.980
Yeah, I'm just stressed with mid-terms.
I don't get them that often.

22:38.648 --> 22:41.151
Can you not tell Pip about it, though?
I just feel like she doesn't...

22:41.943 --> 22:43.236
she wouldn't get it.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.781
Are you implying

22:46.365 --> 22:48.658
that Pippa
can be insensitive?

22:49.242 --> 22:50.452
What? No.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.663
No, I just feel like she...

22:55.415 --> 22:59.002
sometimes,
she doesn't have anything serious

22:59.461 --> 23:00.504
to worry about.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.841
- Right, except all of those orgasms.
- Yeah, except all of the orgasms.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.219
- Many, many orgasms.
- So many.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.972
Shit, sorry. That was mean.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.058
I'm not tryna shit talk.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.396
No, it's okay to shit talk a little,
sometimes. Just a little bit.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.066
All right, everybody.
It's your lucky tonight, round up,

23:21.191 --> 23:22.901
- against the wall let's go.
- Shit.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.611
- What's happening?
- Hey, cut the music!

23:24.820 --> 23:26.113
Alcohol enforcement raid.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.989
- All right, line up.
- Come on, let's go.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.534
- Where are we going?
- Just follow me.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.743
Let's see your ID.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.329
- Where are we going?
- Just hurry.

23:34.913 --> 23:35.956
Shit.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.960
Sh... shouldn't we like, run?
Can't they come out here?

23:40.252 --> 23:43.588
No, just... it's fine. Just act...
act sober. Hold this.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.925
- What? Why?
- I'll be right back.

23:47.134 --> 23:49.719
- I have to pee. Just keep watch.
- Okay.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.017
Oh, my God.

24:07.487 --> 24:08.572
Cabs are that way.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.782
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.582
Is there a reason
why you're standing alone in a dark alley?

24:24.796 --> 24:27.841
- Sorry.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.817
Hey, I need you to come outside,
real quick.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.444
- What?
- Come on, come on, come on.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.743
Up, up, there you go. You, all right?

24:54.951 --> 24:56.536
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Jesus.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.039
Hey, hey. Hey, yo! What the fuck?
What the fuck happened? You, all right?

24:59.039 --> 25:01.708
I don't know, I don't know. I came out.
He was on the driveway, I don't know.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.001
I think he fell down the stairs.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.462
Jesus. Did you hit your head?

25:05.587 --> 25:09.341
- No. It's like my whole body...
- Let's get him home, Wrigley.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.969
We have pledges doing sober-D tonight,
I'll call one of them to drive

25:13.094 --> 25:14.304
- you guys back.
- Okay, are you sure?

25:14.471 --> 25:16.348
Yeah, yeah, of course.
They'll pick you up on the corner.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.684
All right, let's get you home.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.979
Holy shit.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.148
- We're going to take him back.
- Take that arm.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.358
Okay, I'm coming with you.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.734
- Got it, Wrigley?
- Yeah, it's all good.

25:27.734 --> 25:28.860
Don't worry about it.

25:28.985 --> 25:32.656
Oh, my God. Pippa is gonna be so pissed
that she missed

25:32.864 --> 25:36.201
- our almost got arrested story.
- She's gonna freak out.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.828
Oh, my God.

25:40.997 --> 25:42.374
Steak for you.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.668
Enjoy.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.462
He's kind of cute.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.424
- Yeah, he kind of is.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.426
I'm really happy we met.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.556
Oh, my God. How drunk are you right now?

25:57.847 --> 25:59.641
- You're not drunk?
- No.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.687
I'm really happy we met too.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.438
- Aw!
- Aw,

26:06.565 --> 26:07.607
How is everything?

26:08.858 --> 26:10.193
It's so good, thank you.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.030
I'm sorry if we're being too loud,
I hope we're not getting you in trouble

26:14.155 --> 26:15.198
with your boss.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.867
- No. My family owns the place,

26:17.951 --> 26:19.995
so, you'd be getting me in trouble
with my Dad.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.956
It's Tim. There's...
there's an after party on campus.

26:22.956 --> 26:24.124
Oh, my God. Go.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.875
- You don't want to come?
- No, I'm good.

26:26.876 --> 26:28.712
- Okay.
- Go. No, seriously, have fun.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.338
- Okay, okay.
- Bye.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.673
Bye.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.306
So, your friend really likes Tim?

26:40.098 --> 26:42.684
That would be correct. Yeah.

26:43.935 --> 26:44.936
Whoa!

26:45.145 --> 26:47.814
That's cool.
How long did it take you to finish that?

26:50.233 --> 26:51.443
About three years.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.945
I got most of it done on tour.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.322
You're in a band?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.574
Army.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.908
Oh.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.203
- My dad was in the army.
- Yeah?

27:02.704 --> 27:05.749
He was also a smoker.
You should stop that.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.088
You have a really nice smile.

27:17.927 --> 27:18.928
What?

27:21.640 --> 27:22.641
You have a boyfriend?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.522
No, I don't.

27:32.734 --> 27:35.195
- I didn't want to go home, man.
- Come on, Drew, just get into bed.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.531
- Just get in the bed.
- No. Please, man. Please.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.367
Easy. Come on, Drew.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.704
- God.
- We're trying to help you, dude.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.345
I don't want to be here anymore.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.764
Everything is my fault.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.017
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Pull yourself together.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.812
I can't stop thinking about it, man.

28:11.147 --> 28:12.565
Shut up, shut up.

28:13.358 --> 28:14.401
Leave me alone.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.404
Then quit acting like
you're on your fucking period!

28:17.570 --> 28:20.073
Wrigley, Wrigley, Wrigley. Back up,
back up, back up.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.452
Head out. Cool off.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.371
I can't leave. Fucking look at him.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.583
- Look at this shit.
- Hey, I'll clean this up. Head out.

28:36.297 --> 28:37.298
God!

28:38.633 --> 28:39.926
Hey, Wrigley.

28:42.762 --> 28:45.640
Stop! Wait! Are you okay?
What the fuck was all of that about?

28:45.765 --> 28:46.808
Just go home, Pippa.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.518
What?

28:48.685 --> 28:50.353
Just fucking go home or go back
to the party,

28:50.478 --> 28:51.813
you fucking loved it so much, so...

28:51.813 --> 28:54.274
- Okay, what is your problem today?
- My fucking problem?

28:54.858 --> 28:57.193
Why the fuck were you throwing
yourself at every fucking loser

28:57.277 --> 28:59.946
- you could find?
- Okay. You know what? I'm going home.

29:02.073 --> 29:03.992
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey,
I'm sorry.

29:03.992 --> 29:05.994
- No, you're being a fucking dick.
- I know. I'm sorry.

29:06.828 --> 29:07.871
I'm sorry.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.458
Okay, look. I know you're hooking up
with other girls.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.835
I see you on your phone, I don't care.
I just wish you would stop

29:13.835 --> 29:16.254
- being so weird and secretive about it.
- What? No. I'm not hooking up

29:16.254 --> 29:18.339
with other girls.
I don't give a shit about other girls.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.678
I have a lot on my fucking mind
right now. And if I'm acting weird

29:23.845 --> 29:26.389
or anything, it has nothing...
it has nothing to do with you.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.057
I'm... I... I promise.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.894
- Trust me, can you please trust me?
- Yeah, you know what? Trust.

29:32.395 --> 29:36.065
Everybody knows that you fuck
like half of the girls on this campus.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.567
Why should I be any different?

29:38.359 --> 29:40.612
Because you are. You are.

29:43.364 --> 29:44.532
I'm going to go.

29:44.866 --> 29:47.494
Pippa. Drew was there,
the night Macy died.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.581
Wait, what do you...
What do you mean he was there?

29:52.123 --> 29:55.001
He was... he... he... he...
he was in his car and he...

29:55.251 --> 29:57.670
and he was driving back to campus
and I guess Macy came around the corner

29:57.796 --> 30:01.007
and they... and they both swerved out. And...

30:01.925 --> 30:03.593
I know he...
he saw her crash into the tree

30:03.593 --> 30:05.220
and he should've stayed.
He should've stayed

30:05.386 --> 30:07.055
and he should've gotten help,
but he... he left.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.603
She died.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.066
I know. I know.

30:26.950 --> 30:27.992
What are you thinking?

30:31.287 --> 30:34.916
I don't... I don't... I don't...
I don't even know.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.674
Are you... are you going to, like,

30:43.466 --> 30:45.301
tell... tell anyone
about it like Macy's parents

30:45.385 --> 30:46.553
- or...
- Macy's parents?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.763
No, of course not.
I'm not going to tell Macy's parents.

30:49.722 --> 30:50.682
No.

30:51.432 --> 30:54.060
What... what am I supposed to do
with this information?

30:54.185 --> 30:55.812
- Nothing. You do nothing with it.
- What?

30:55.937 --> 30:58.231
Well, Pippa, this is my little brother
we're talking about, all right?

30:58.231 --> 31:00.358
You cannot tell anyone.
You cannot tell Lucy.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.110
You cannot tell Bree or anyone.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.738
- Are you kidding me?
- No, no.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.200
- Promise me, okay? Promise me.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.579
Okay, look.

31:17.125 --> 31:19.043
You don't know this about me
because we don't really know

31:19.168 --> 31:20.211
each other that well.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.089
But I don't have a lot of friends...

31:24.340 --> 31:25.884
especially girlfriends.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.304
And now you want me
to keep this huge secret

31:29.429 --> 31:30.972
from the only two that I have?

31:31.431 --> 31:33.349
What are you talking about?
You have loads of friends.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.269
I really wish you didn't tell me this.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.899
I have to go. I have to go.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.277
Did you just tell her?

31:46.487 --> 31:47.530
Yeah.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.160
I love you, man...

31:55.413 --> 31:57.832
I hope this doesn't become
a bigger fucking problem now.

31:58.124 --> 31:59.208
I'm sorry.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.088
- No, no, no. Come on.
- All right.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.627
Good morning.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.880
Morning.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.217
I... I have to run back to campus.

32:53.596 --> 32:54.847
Let me give you a ride.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.142
No, it's fine.
I'll just... I'll just take a bus.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.895
I can't let you take the bus.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.983
I actually weirdly like taking the bus.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.445
Let me take you out to dinner sometime.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.658
Yeah, I'll... I'll call you.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.934
Okay, that's it,
pencils down, everybody.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.149
Pencils down.

34:14.635 --> 34:15.803
How was your test?

34:17.305 --> 34:19.599
Good. I think it was good.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.939
Come on. Come on.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.162
You want to watch something?

34:41.996 --> 34:43.039
Okay.

35:28.584 --> 35:31.045
Mr. DeMarco. Do we have an appointment?

35:31.379 --> 35:35.133
Hi, Professor. No, sorry.
Should I make one and come back?

35:35.383 --> 35:37.218
You're here already.
How may I help you, Stephen?

35:37.468 --> 35:39.720
I know that I've... I've been,

35:41.597 --> 35:42.723
somewhat of a...

35:43.683 --> 35:48.646
smartass in your class. And I... I...
I wanted to apologize.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.314
Well, I appreciate that, thank you.

35:50.439 --> 35:52.525
And I'm really hoping
that it won't impact your decision

35:52.525 --> 35:54.360
on the research position.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.445
Mm.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.030
It didn't.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.867
But I did grant the position
to someone else.

36:05.121 --> 36:07.915
Thank you for... for your, for your time.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.168
Professor, may I ask.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.628
Who did get the position?

36:14.046 --> 36:15.131
Diana Linder.

37:21.155 --> 37:22.198
Hey.

37:25.534 --> 37:26.702
Can we talk?

37:46.973 --> 37:48.140
What do you want?

37:49.225 --> 37:52.144
This whole ignoring each other thing
is a little juvenile, don't you think?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.105
I'm not ignoring you.

37:55.022 --> 37:56.440
You're not talking to me.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.734
We've nothing to talk about.

37:59.735 --> 38:00.778
We don't?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.322
No.

38:04.365 --> 38:05.825
You wanted my attention,

38:06.867 --> 38:10.621
and you got it,
so what are you going to do with it?

38:12.039 --> 38:13.040
What are you talking about?

38:14.625 --> 38:16.043
You got the research position.

38:17.086 --> 38:18.796
Oh, my God.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.506
You're ridiculous.

38:21.048 --> 38:22.425
You didn't do that to...

38:23.509 --> 38:24.552
fuck with me? Or...

38:25.845 --> 38:27.305
Not everything is about you.

38:28.347 --> 38:31.183
Right, but that... was.

38:31.892 --> 38:35.396
I applied because I wanted to
and I got the job because

38:35.521 --> 38:36.731
I am better than you.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.399
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.651
But you know that.

38:41.360 --> 38:42.778
That's what you love about me,

38:43.446 --> 38:44.905
that's why you are standing here
right now.

38:45.614 --> 38:49.410
I... I... I think... I think
you got the job because Professor Schultz

38:50.077 --> 38:51.537
wants to fuck you.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.583
That's right, Stephen.

38:56.959 --> 38:59.920
Schultz gets so fucking hard for me.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.723
Way harder than you can.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.018
- Fuck!
- Look at me.

39:16.937 --> 39:17.938
Fuck you...

39:26.072 --> 39:27.239
Look at me.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.786
You don't want me to touch you? Fine.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.128
Look at me.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.385
Look up at me.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.087
You want me to stop?

40:30.928 --> 40:32.012
Do you?

40:35.099 --> 40:36.308
No.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.151
You're going to retake your mid-term.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.778
You will work with a tutor,

41:30.070 --> 41:32.114
and she will give you extra time
to take the test.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.534
So, I can still play?

41:37.369 --> 41:39.371
Football's very important to our alumni.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.468
Fuck!

41:55.596 --> 41:56.722
What?

42:08.025 --> 42:09.443
We always do this.

42:10.945 --> 42:11.946
It's like...

42:12.863 --> 42:13.948
a sick cycle.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.286
We're not even nice to each other
half the time.

42:21.622 --> 42:24.083
You don't want me to be nice to you.
Everyone's nice to you.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.673
You'd be bored of me if I was like
everybody else.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.219
- Hey.
- I just...

42:37.054 --> 42:39.223
I can't stop thinking
about what you did.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.435
Okay.

42:47.106 --> 42:50.943
I have too much respect for myself
to let someone openly disrespect me.

42:57.199 --> 42:58.659
That was last year, Diana.

42:59.868 --> 43:01.328
You know why we're in a cycle?

43:01.662 --> 43:03.831
Because you can't let shit go.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.876
You don't want to do this? That's fine.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.588
Then act like it.

43:13.549 --> 43:14.717
And we'll just...

43:16.093 --> 43:17.344
stay away from each other.

43:18.053 --> 43:19.263
You don't care about me.

43:20.806 --> 43:22.141
You just don't know how to be alone.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.274
I do actually, I do care about you.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.320
But it's not even what you want.

43:38.699 --> 43:41.243
You want me to keep convincing you
that I care about you,

43:41.410 --> 43:42.745
over and over and over.

43:45.789 --> 43:46.874
I give up.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.145
Hey...

44:12.441 --> 44:13.817
Thanks for meeting me.

44:15.444 --> 44:16.570
Look, Pippa...

44:19.239 --> 44:20.532
I'm so sorry.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.078
I... I...
I didn't mean to drag you into this.

44:24.453 --> 44:26.163
And I was just worried about Drew

44:26.163 --> 44:28.082
- and I... I... I guess I wasn't thinking.
- Yeah.

44:28.248 --> 44:29.375
And I understand why you're mad.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.418
But... but you know, I...

44:32.878 --> 44:33.837
I just...

44:35.255 --> 44:36.632
I didn't know what to do.

44:37.591 --> 44:40.052
And I felt like I was drowning
or something.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.221
I don't know
if it makes fucking any sense.

44:42.221 --> 44:43.389
I don't know.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.309
Yeah. No, it...

44:48.435 --> 44:49.561
it does.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.362
I don't want to fight. I... I just...

45:00.739 --> 45:02.241
wish I didn't know this.

45:03.742 --> 45:04.785
I know.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.620
I know, I'm sorry.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.498
- It's okay. No. It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

45:10.999 --> 45:12.876
Did... did you mean what you said
about how we don't know

45:12.960 --> 45:14.044
each other that well?

45:16.004 --> 45:17.631
No. No, I didn't mean it.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.721
I still want to hang out with you...

45:25.597 --> 45:26.849
if you're still down to do that.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.145
Look...

45:32.563 --> 45:34.273
Okay, yeah, like,
I'm not going anywhere.

45:35.649 --> 45:38.152
- Yeah? All right.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.729
You know, I was thinking
about our conversation,

46:14.021 --> 46:15.856
about sleeping with other people.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.569
And I think to be safe,
we should probably keep using protection.

46:20.819 --> 46:21.987
Yeah.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.990
- That makes sense.
- Mm-hmm.

46:28.202 --> 46:29.203
I mean...

46:32.372 --> 46:34.583
- I was going to go on the pill.
- Mm.

46:36.877 --> 46:37.920
Because...

46:41.048 --> 46:44.134
I really want to feel you
without a condom.

46:48.847 --> 46:51.016
I'm sure it would feel so amazing.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.686
I've never done that before with anyone.

47:00.108 --> 47:02.194
But, you know,

47:02.986 --> 47:04.321
I don't want to be a cliché

47:04.488 --> 47:07.533
and get chlamydia
in my freshmen year, so...

47:08.158 --> 47:09.535
No. that wouldn't be ideal.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.037
No, it wouldn't.

47:14.414 --> 47:15.624
You don't have to worry.

47:18.210 --> 47:21.046
I would... I would never put you at risk.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.802
And you are the only person...

47:29.638 --> 47:31.014
who I wouldn't use a condom with.

47:34.560 --> 47:40.274
And if I did sleep with anyone else,
I would obviously wear one for you.

48:08.635 --> 48:09.678
Yeah.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.513
<i>Don't answer like that.</i>

48:14.224 --> 48:15.475
What do you want?

48:15.934 --> 48:17.144
<i>You were right.</i>

48:18.228 --> 48:20.314
<i>I'm the one
who isn't letting shit go.</i>

48:21.148 --> 48:22.482
<i>That's not fair.</i>

48:24.443 --> 48:26.194
Well, I wasn't expecting that.

48:26.820 --> 48:30.198
<i>Look, we both want to keep
seeing each other and it's stupid</i>

48:30.324 --> 48:31.992
<i>to pretend like
we're not going to do it again.</i>

48:32.284 --> 48:35.245
<i>But I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.</i>

48:36.496 --> 48:38.916
<i>We're not back together,
we're...</i>

48:40.125 --> 48:41.460
<i>hanging out.</i>

48:44.546 --> 48:45.547
Hanging out?

48:45.756 --> 48:48.091
<i>I don't want anyone to know.
They'll insert their opinions</i>

48:48.175 --> 48:50.010
<i>and fuck it up.
I just want to take it slow</i>

48:50.135 --> 48:51.261
<i>and figure it out.</i>

48:51.386 --> 48:53.764
<i>Just us, then maybe
we can make it official again.</i>

48:54.139 --> 48:56.099
Yeah, I... I can...

48:56.934 --> 48:58.977
I can do that. I can...

48:59.728 --> 49:01.438
I can be your...

49:01.939 --> 49:03.023
secret.

49:04.274 --> 49:06.610
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>
