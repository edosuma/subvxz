00:42.018 --> 00:44.319
<i>I was always
the smart one.</i>

00:44.352 --> 00:45.855
<i>The one who played to win.</i>

00:48.457 --> 00:51.761
<i>I was damn good at it.
I was the best.</i>

00:54.296 --> 00:56.364
<i>But then I took my eye
off the ball,</i>

00:56.398 --> 01:00.737
<i>and just like that,
the rules of the game changed.</i>

01:03.773 --> 01:05.842
<i>I was no longer playing
to win.</i>

01:07.442 --> 01:08.778
<i>This was a new game.</i>

01:11.848 --> 01:13.548
<i>I'm playing for my life now.</i>

01:36.739 --> 01:38.607
I'm...
I'm very flattered.

01:40.676 --> 01:41.844
- Like...
- I like that.

01:41.878 --> 01:44.646
...this sweater for me, man,
and I said, "Hey, I tried."

01:44.680 --> 01:45.715
It's a nice sweater.

01:45.748 --> 01:46.749
And she talked me
into it. She talked me...

01:46.783 --> 01:48.718
Well, at least she knows
what looks good on you.

01:48.751 --> 01:49.886
Thank you. Thank you.

01:49.919 --> 01:51.419
I told ya.

01:51.453 --> 01:52.989
Yeah,
she's something else.

01:54.523 --> 01:55.457
Come on, man.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.325
Look, D, we are trying
to have a good time.

01:57.359 --> 01:58.560
- Will you please... All right?
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:58.593 --> 01:59.661
You're right.
Absolutely right.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.763
We're having fun, man.
Relax.

02:00.797 --> 02:01.898
We're done.
We're done.

02:01.931 --> 02:03.632
You see what I'm dealing with?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.468
- For you and...
- Thank you.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.370
- And this is for you.
- Oh, the good stuff.

02:10.106 --> 02:13.876
Anyway, hon, he has
told us nothing about you.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.678
What do you do?
How'd you two meet?

02:15.711 --> 02:18.613
Interesting story.
We met in an art gallery.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.016
Wait, do you know
what an art gallery is?

02:20.049 --> 02:21.349
You went to
an art gallery?

02:21.383 --> 02:22.685
- Well...
- To buy art?

02:22.718 --> 02:24.553
- Rafe, you liar.
- No, no.

02:24.586 --> 02:25.922
Hey, I want to make a toast.

02:27.389 --> 02:28.791
To everything we've built.

02:28.825 --> 02:30.525
To everything we've built.

02:30.559 --> 02:31.459
Yeah, no.

02:31.493 --> 02:35.865
To us, and everything
that we've built.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.667
How about I propose a toast

02:38.701 --> 02:41.670
to, uh, everyone
and everything

02:41.704 --> 02:43.806
that we all have built.

02:43.840 --> 02:44.974
- Mmm.
- Touche.

02:46.075 --> 02:47.210
To billions of dollars, right?

02:47.243 --> 02:48.177
Or millions
of dollars, I like that, too.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.245
- I knew you'd...
- My baby's got to...

02:49.278 --> 02:51.479
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Oh, my God, Rafe!

02:51.513 --> 02:53.515
- My bad, my bad.
- Here we go. I've got it.

02:54.583 --> 02:55.450
You know what?

02:55.483 --> 02:58.453
- Wait, this expensive...
- Oh, no.

03:14.937 --> 03:15.972
<i>This just in,</i>

03:16.005 --> 03:17.773
<i>LA city politician

<i>Thank you very much.</i>

03:50.139 --> 03:51.406
Thanks.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.175
Thought you left.

03:54.010 --> 03:55.978
Not yet.

03:56.012 --> 03:57.412
What time is it?

03:57.813 --> 03:58.948
3:00.

03:58.981 --> 04:00.448
Shit.

04:00.482 --> 04:01.650
I have a house to show
in Hancock Park,

04:01.684 --> 04:02.752
and I'm running late.

04:06.022 --> 04:08.490
Yeah. Speaking of late, uh...

04:09.658 --> 04:11.928
A couple of nights ago,
you got home,

04:11.961 --> 04:13.428
you got in after midnight.

04:15.597 --> 04:17.565
Yeah. The buyers took forever
to close the deal,

04:17.599 --> 04:19.936
and then they wanted to go out
and celebrate.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.470
What'd you want me to say?
"No"?

04:22.504 --> 04:23.773
You know how many nights
I stayed home

04:23.806 --> 04:25.942
while you were out on the town
with your clients,

04:25.975 --> 04:27.209
building your career?

04:27.243 --> 04:30.012
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
You remind me all the time,

04:30.046 --> 04:31.948
but that career has provided
the lifestyle that we love.

04:31.981 --> 04:34.649
How many times do we
have to go through this, Derrick?

04:34.684 --> 04:37.619
I wanted my own career,
not yours.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.089
Now I finally have one,
and you want me to give it up.

04:40.122 --> 04:42.024
I never asked you
to stop working.

04:42.058 --> 04:43.192
I just want to know
where you were.

04:43.225 --> 04:44.427
Can we fight later?

04:48.097 --> 04:50.833
I just want to spend time
with my wife.

04:50.866 --> 04:53.568
I don't need to go to Vegas.
I'll cancel the trip.

04:53.601 --> 04:54.804
I'll stay right here.

04:57.139 --> 04:58.741
Just go to Vegas
with your buddies.

04:59.709 --> 05:00.710
I don't care.

05:53.661 --> 05:54.897
You about to get turnt.

05:56.598 --> 05:58.566
We in Vegas, baby.
What's up with you, man?

05:58.600 --> 05:59.435
Look at all this ass

05:59.468 --> 06:00.736
- around here, dawg.
- Yeah.

06:00.770 --> 06:02.738
Oh, we got half the NBA

06:02.772 --> 06:04.774
who wants to be represented
by us, all right?

06:04.807 --> 06:07.009
Shit, now you said it
and you live it.

06:07.043 --> 06:08.643
So, look, man,

06:08.677 --> 06:10.612
when you stress,
I stress, all right?

06:10.645 --> 06:11.680
So, talk to me.

06:12.647 --> 06:14.116
It's... It's Tracie.

06:14.150 --> 06:15.284
What about her?

06:15.317 --> 06:18.721
I just... I've been having
this feeling, right? That...

06:20.856 --> 06:22.091
I don't know.

06:22.124 --> 06:24.760
I think she might be seeing
somebody else.

06:24.794 --> 06:25.861
It's crazy, right?

06:27.730 --> 06:28.898
Why?

06:29.765 --> 06:31.133
You seein' signs?

06:31.167 --> 06:33.668
Mm-mmm... No. It's not that.
It's...

06:35.670 --> 06:36.872
It's like when
we first got married,

06:36.906 --> 06:38.974
we were the perfect couple.

06:39.008 --> 06:40.309
And now we're like
two strangers

06:40.342 --> 06:41.710
in the same house.

06:43.245 --> 06:44.246
Look, man...

06:46.415 --> 06:48.150
it's not your fault.

06:48.184 --> 06:50.953
You're a great husband.

06:50.986 --> 06:52.288
And what you're experiencing
right now

06:52.321 --> 06:55.825
is called seven years
of marriage.

06:55.858 --> 06:58.294
- Okay.
- But luckily, there is a cure.

07:00.096 --> 07:01.063
What?

07:01.097 --> 07:01.831
- Gimme your left hand.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:01.864 --> 07:03.365
Come on,
give me the ring.

07:03.399 --> 07:05.633
Come on. Fuck! Shit, dawg.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.836
Give it... Give me the ring,
please?

07:06.869 --> 07:09.205
No. Uh-uh.

07:09.238 --> 07:12.208
This ring represents marriage.

07:12.241 --> 07:14.310
And right now,
you ain't in one.

07:15.244 --> 07:16.378
We at a bachelor party

07:16.412 --> 07:19.115
with an emphasis
on "bachelor."

07:19.148 --> 07:22.418
For the next 24 hours,
you are a single man.

07:22.451 --> 07:24.320
- I didn't come here for this.
- Just...

07:24.353 --> 07:25.721
Shit, man.

07:25.754 --> 07:27.857
- Give it back...
- Look, man.

07:27.890 --> 07:29.291
Enjoy yourself, all right?

07:29.325 --> 07:31.026
Let's have a toast, come on.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.963
All right, everybody,
let's have a toast.

07:35.064 --> 07:36.832
To Reggie.

08:32.821 --> 08:34.156
Hey,
what can I get for you?

08:34.190 --> 08:35.391
- Water, please.
- Right.

08:37.493 --> 08:38.894
Well, hello.

08:39.495 --> 08:40.729
You know, I was thinking,

08:40.763 --> 08:42.431
we should just skip
the drinks.

08:42.464 --> 08:45.167
Get your hand off me
and get out of here.

08:54.376 --> 08:55.911
- It's Vegas.
- Yeah.

08:55.945 --> 08:57.213
It brings out the predators.

08:59.181 --> 09:01.817
And... and the clowns, yeah.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.758
It's hot in here, ain't it?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.232
Is that the best you can do?

09:18.267 --> 09:19.301
I'm so sorry.

09:19.335 --> 09:21.870
I'm, uh, out of practice.

09:23.572 --> 09:26.108
What are you, uh, here, doing?

09:26.642 --> 09:29.178
Ah... Bachelor party.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.814
You're not the bachelor,
I hope?

09:32.848 --> 09:34.016
No.

09:41.023 --> 09:42.057
No, actually I'm...

09:42.091 --> 09:43.125
- What?
- ...married.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.929
Sorry, I can't hear you.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.336
What about you?
Are you with a group?

09:54.370 --> 09:59.441
No, I'm, uh,
an unaccompanied adult.

10:02.177 --> 10:03.479
Are you on vacation?

10:04.513 --> 10:06.382
Not exactly. Um...

10:07.149 --> 10:11.220
It's more
a therapeutic getaway.

10:11.253 --> 10:15.024
I have a... a high-stress job
in another city.

10:15.057 --> 10:17.126
So, when I need to relieve
the tension,

10:17.159 --> 10:18.827
I come to Vegas,

10:18.861 --> 10:22.431
and I let myself go
a little insane, you know?

10:22.464 --> 10:24.166
I highly recommend it.

10:24.701 --> 10:26.235
Do I look stressed?

10:28.304 --> 10:29.805
Actually, you do.

10:30.205 --> 10:31.240
I am.

10:37.079 --> 10:39.581
I'm Val, by the way.

10:39.615 --> 10:42.251
This would be about the time
that you tell me your name.

10:44.286 --> 10:46.388
- I'm Darren.
- Darren.

10:47.423 --> 10:48.524
Nice to meet you.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.927
Nice to meet you.

10:53.562 --> 10:54.563
Oh...

10:55.931 --> 10:56.999
Sorry.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.071
Shit. I'm sorry.
All right, let me, uh...

11:02.938 --> 11:04.440
Here. I'm sorry.

11:05.174 --> 11:07.142
Here you go. Uh...

11:07.176 --> 11:08.510
You spilled it, so...

11:13.449 --> 11:14.450
Sure.

11:19.288 --> 11:20.356
Thanks.

11:21.924 --> 11:22.925
Wanna dance?

11:23.459 --> 11:24.460
Yeah.

13:16.706 --> 13:20.008
Mmm, my great escape.

13:20.042 --> 13:22.377
Uh, sorry.
Sorry to wake you up.

13:23.445 --> 13:24.513
Mm-hmm.

13:24.546 --> 13:26.615
You can go right back
to sleep, you know?

13:26.648 --> 13:28.650
I got to catch a flight.

13:33.155 --> 13:34.189
Where?

13:35.224 --> 13:36.258
Seattle.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.261
Where's my...

13:41.230 --> 13:42.498
What's wrong?

13:42.531 --> 13:45.300
Um... I can't find my phone.

13:46.435 --> 13:47.436
Oh.

13:48.504 --> 13:50.405
It's in the room safe.

13:55.778 --> 13:56.813
What?

13:56.846 --> 14:00.349
I put it in there in case
you tried to sneak away.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.585
Okay.
Well, just give me...

14:03.619 --> 14:05.087
Give me the combination.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.121
Hmm.

14:07.289 --> 14:08.624
I forgot it.

14:08.657 --> 14:09.759
Seriously?

14:10.727 --> 14:12.127
You're kidding, right?

14:12.494 --> 14:13.629
Nope.

14:17.466 --> 14:20.837
Look, I... I... You know,
got to get to McCarran,

14:20.870 --> 14:23.138
so I don't have the time
to play games. So...

14:23.171 --> 14:24.841
Well, then you
shouldn't have come to Vegas.

14:24.874 --> 14:26.208
Yeah. Just give me
the code, please.

14:26.876 --> 14:28.343
Well, then you'd leave.

14:28.377 --> 14:31.213
Yeah, that's the general idea.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.081
Well, what if I'm not done
with you?

14:36.719 --> 14:38.587
Wait, what do you mean,
"Not done with me"?

14:38.620 --> 14:40.790
I'm gonna need more.

14:40.823 --> 14:43.392
Come on,
Darren from Seattle.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.493
Stay and play.

14:46.395 --> 14:50.198
Hmm, please?
Give me a little more.

14:52.568 --> 14:54.069
I got to fuck it out of you?

14:55.537 --> 14:57.406
Well, if it's not
too much trouble.

15:31.273 --> 15:32.507
Shit.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.337
Hey.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.939
- May I help you?
- You must be new.

16:36.973 --> 16:38.340
Yeah. I just started
this week.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.976
I'm Tyrin,
I'm Derrick's cousin.

16:40.009 --> 16:42.511
Oh, well, Mr. Tyler's
in a meeting with a client...

16:42.544 --> 16:43.545
Never mind, I see him.

16:46.515 --> 16:49.384
What's up, boy?
How you doin'?

16:49.418 --> 16:52.354
It fits the, um...
It's, um...

16:52.387 --> 16:53.890
So that's my cousin.

16:53.923 --> 16:56.759
Um, at the end of the day,
I think all of our clients

16:56.793 --> 16:59.261
will testify that we,
you know...

16:59.294 --> 17:01.430
We have the best style
of brand management.

17:01.463 --> 17:03.365
Damn, that'll be
an awesome plan, Derrick.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.001
- All right. All right.
- Smart man.

17:05.034 --> 17:06.836
You guys are rising stars.

17:06.869 --> 17:08.971
I guess, let's rise,
let's rise together, man.

17:09.005 --> 17:10.272
- All right?
- Thank you, man. Thank you.

17:10.305 --> 17:12.374
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

17:12.407 --> 17:15.277
My receptionist told me there
was an intruder in my office.

17:15.310 --> 17:17.479
Oh. No-look pass.

17:17.512 --> 17:19.782
- Oh.
- Did you see Lance?

17:19.816 --> 17:21.616
I just closed a big
energy drink deal with him.

17:21.650 --> 17:23.585
What? Did he LeBron you?

17:23.618 --> 17:24.653
What?

17:24.687 --> 17:25.855
Did he whisper in your ear?

17:25.888 --> 17:27.023
Man, get the fuck out.

17:27.056 --> 17:28.390
Come on.

17:28.858 --> 17:29.826
Nah, D-man,

17:29.859 --> 17:32.360
I don't know if I ever
told you, man, but...

17:33.395 --> 17:34.931
- Proud of you.
- Thank you.

17:34.964 --> 17:36.398
Thank you.
I got to talk to you.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.600
- What's up?
- Mom called yesterday.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.368
She said she hasn't seen you
in two weeks.

17:40.402 --> 17:41.369
I came to get this money
from you,

17:41.403 --> 17:42.905
then I'm going to check
on Moms. I got you.

17:42.939 --> 17:44.306
I know why you're here,
all right?

17:44.339 --> 17:45.507
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

17:45.540 --> 17:46.441
You didn't think
I would catch that, huh?

17:46.475 --> 17:48.376
I knew you had it.

17:48.811 --> 17:49.879
All right.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.614
All right.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.951
So, this money comes
with strings.

17:54.984 --> 17:56.052
Strings?

17:57.452 --> 17:59.321
Call Mom. She worries.

17:59.354 --> 18:00.455
I got you.

18:00.489 --> 18:01.791
Promise?

18:01.824 --> 18:02.992
- I'm gonna go see her.
- All right,

18:03.025 --> 18:05.427
look, good to see you.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.029
- Love you, boy.
- You too, man.

18:07.063 --> 18:08.798
All right. Come by the house
some time, all right?

18:08.831 --> 18:10.833
Come on, man. You know your
wife ain't messing with me.

18:10.867 --> 18:13.335
She ain't really messing with
me much these days either.

18:13.368 --> 18:14.469
Trouble in paradise?

18:15.437 --> 18:16.438
I'll fix it.

18:17.339 --> 18:18.473
Fix it, okay?

18:18.507 --> 18:20.575
We don't need her taking half
our Lance Stephenson deal.

18:21.177 --> 18:23.012
- We need that.
- Gotcha.

18:25.014 --> 18:27.549
Yo, yo, yo.
What up? What up?

18:27.582 --> 18:29.551
I see some cash.

18:29.584 --> 18:30.519
Let me guess.

18:30.552 --> 18:33.555
Another amazing
business opportunity, huh?

18:33.588 --> 18:34.523
You know what?

18:34.556 --> 18:36.591
I love the skinny
church slacks. Incredible.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.694
Up high.
Come on, dawg.

18:38.728 --> 18:40.295
Come on,
I give you a boost, huh?

18:40.629 --> 18:41.463
Come on.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.032
I'm messing with you,
man, come on.

18:43.065 --> 18:44.566
Give us a minute
so we can have some

18:44.599 --> 18:47.302
grown-folk conversation, yeah?

18:48.503 --> 18:49.337
Incredible, man.

18:49.371 --> 18:50.639
I'm just fucking
with you, man.

18:50.672 --> 18:51.673
Watch yourself.

18:53.743 --> 18:55.011
Short-ass motherfucker.

18:55.044 --> 18:57.479
I can't believe they still make
short motherfuckers like that.

18:57.512 --> 18:58.881
Damn.

18:58.915 --> 19:01.383
Yo, why you still
giving Tyrin money, man?

19:02.450 --> 19:03.518
That's family.

19:03.552 --> 19:04.987
Okay. Family.

19:05.021 --> 19:06.722
Well, why don't you mail him
a check?

19:06.756 --> 19:08.024
'Cause every time
he brings his raggedy ass

19:08.057 --> 19:09.424
around here,
it's bad for business.

19:09.457 --> 19:11.459
Hey, easy, easy, Rafe,
all right?

19:11.493 --> 19:14.629
Tyrin, he's...
He's off limits, okay?

19:14.663 --> 19:16.799
He's off limits. Okay.
You do you.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.533
Uh, let's talk WME.

19:20.837 --> 19:22.437
What's there to talk about?

19:22.470 --> 19:23.706
Dude, Tim Perkins
is breathing down my neck

19:23.739 --> 19:25.141
day and night, dawg.

19:25.174 --> 19:26.541
Dude, he's fucking serious.

19:26.575 --> 19:29.411
He is legit
about buying this agency.

19:29.444 --> 19:32.480
Derrick, we just signed
Lance Stephenson, man.

19:32.514 --> 19:35.151
One more piece of the puzzle.
We got a stable of athletes.

19:35.184 --> 19:38.420
If WME acquires us,
that is worth millions, dawg.

19:38.453 --> 19:39.755
We'd be a part of
a global empire.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.523
We started this agency

19:41.556 --> 19:43.458
because we didn't wanna work
for anyone else.

19:43.860 --> 19:45.027
We built this.

19:45.862 --> 19:46.929
It's ours.

19:46.963 --> 19:48.363
We work for us.

19:48.865 --> 19:49.966
Not a monolith.

19:49.999 --> 19:51.100
We should at least
consider the deal.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.434
Just hear them out.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.103
I know exactly
what you're saying,

19:54.136 --> 19:56.671
but we both got to agree
to sell,

19:56.706 --> 19:57.807
and I don't agree.

20:03.913 --> 20:05.513
All right. I trust you, man.

20:07.216 --> 20:08.784
Let me just leave you
with this, though.

20:08.818 --> 20:10.052
We started out small, man.

20:11.220 --> 20:13.122
A small black company.

20:13.155 --> 20:14.389
Look at us.

20:14.991 --> 20:16.658
They want us.

20:16.692 --> 20:18.928
You did that, all right?

20:18.961 --> 20:20.662
Take it seriously.

20:20.696 --> 20:23.866
That offer, that will not be
on the table forever.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.769
Just... Just sayin',
all right?

20:31.207 --> 20:32.407
Lance Stephenson...

20:33.042 --> 20:34.176
you did that.

21:02.671 --> 21:03.706
Derrick?

21:03.739 --> 21:05.207
Hey. Hey.

21:05.241 --> 21:06.943
Hey, you're home early.

21:07.209 --> 21:08.476
Okay.

21:08.510 --> 21:10.980
Um, hope you brought
your appetite.

21:11.013 --> 21:12.048
You're cooking?

21:12.081 --> 21:13.581
Come here,
I want you to taste this.

21:17.153 --> 21:19.188
Mmm-hmm.

21:19.221 --> 21:21.257
What do you think?
Tell me the truth.

21:21.290 --> 21:22.590
- It's good.
- It's good?

21:22.624 --> 21:25.493
- It's good.
- Great, great, great.

21:25.527 --> 21:27.897
The rest should be ready
pretty soon.

21:27.930 --> 21:29.732
You haven't done this
since we started dating.

21:29.765 --> 21:32.969
Yeah, I know. That's, um...
That's the idea.

21:33.002 --> 21:34.203
This is a date?

21:34.236 --> 21:35.470
Why not?

21:37.605 --> 21:39.474
I kind of miss those days.

21:40.242 --> 21:41.677
We could get it back.

21:44.046 --> 21:45.547
Am I being punked?

21:45.580 --> 21:46.648
Anyone seen my husband?

21:46.682 --> 21:47.683
I deserve that.

21:49.018 --> 21:51.887
Oh, Tracie,
something I want to tell you.

21:52.788 --> 21:55.024
Look, I've given myself
a wakeup call.

21:55.057 --> 21:56.591
We've been going
in different directions,

21:56.624 --> 21:59.128
and I want to get
on the same path.

21:59.795 --> 22:02.698
So maybe...

22:05.935 --> 22:07.203
we should settle down...

22:10.306 --> 22:11.539
raise a family.

22:15.144 --> 22:16.245
A girl for you.

22:19.815 --> 22:22.051
Maybe a boy for me.

22:22.084 --> 22:24.586
Okay, Babyface.

22:24.619 --> 22:27.056
What? What...
You remember that one?

22:27.089 --> 22:28.758
Well...

22:30.326 --> 22:31.861
Those are definitely
not your lines.

22:34.964 --> 22:37.532
Let me turn this up.
Hold up. Okay.

22:38.701 --> 22:41.704
There we go. Oh, shit.

22:43.605 --> 22:44.639
Oh!

22:47.777 --> 22:48.778
Come on.

22:49.378 --> 22:51.080
- Come on.
- Okay.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.792
Wait, wait.
What was that?

23:36.826 --> 23:38.660
What?

23:38.694 --> 23:39.895
That noise,
what was that?

23:40.362 --> 23:41.697
What noise?

23:45.401 --> 23:46.702
What is that?

23:49.071 --> 23:50.206
I think it's upstairs.

26:09.912 --> 26:10.946
Derrick!

26:11.247 --> 26:12.381
Call 911!

26:22.157 --> 26:23.959
What about
these security cams?

26:23.993 --> 26:26.462
I see them all over the house,
inside out.

26:26.495 --> 26:29.164
The system went offline
about a month ago,

26:29.198 --> 26:31.233
and I just haven't
had a chance to get it fixed.

26:32.935 --> 26:34.436
Hmm. And the alarm?

26:34.470 --> 26:36.238
I thought we put it on
before we went to sleep,

26:36.272 --> 26:38.540
but we're always
forgetting it.

26:39.275 --> 26:41.443
- Detective Quinlan's here.
- Oh.

26:41.477 --> 26:44.046
Uh, Detective Quinlan
just arrived.

26:44.079 --> 26:46.949
The detective will be taking
care of you from here on out.

27:17.980 --> 27:22.017
Mr. and Mrs. Tyler,
I'm Detective Valerie Quinlan.

27:24.453 --> 27:26.288
I'm sure this was
a very terrifying ordeal

27:26.322 --> 27:27.456
for you guys tonight.

27:31.226 --> 27:35.564
Your first name,
is it Derrick or Darren?

27:36.899 --> 27:37.933
It's Derrick.

27:38.300 --> 27:39.368
Derrick.

27:40.302 --> 27:41.937
I understand that you came

27:41.970 --> 27:43.405
face to face
with the intruder?

27:48.510 --> 27:51.513
Um... I didn't see his face.

27:51.547 --> 27:54.016
You know, he was choking me,

27:54.049 --> 27:55.984
he fired a gun
a couple of times.

27:56.018 --> 27:57.186
Have we met before?

27:57.219 --> 27:58.887
Excuse me?

27:58.921 --> 28:02.157
I'm certain
I know you from somewhere.

28:04.660 --> 28:06.195
I don't think so.

28:06.228 --> 28:07.363
Are you sure?

28:07.396 --> 28:08.997
I'm certain I know you
from somewhere.

28:09.031 --> 28:10.999
My husband was
a college basketball star.

28:11.033 --> 28:13.469
He represents
a lot of sports figures,

28:13.502 --> 28:15.437
so he gets interviewed
on TV a lot.

28:15.471 --> 28:18.006
Oh. On TV.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.908
That's probably
where I've seen you.

28:21.678 --> 28:23.278
And where were you,
Mrs. Tyler,

28:23.312 --> 28:24.480
when this happened?

28:25.581 --> 28:27.383
I was downstairs
in our bedroom.

28:27.416 --> 28:28.617
Will you take me there,
please?

28:28.650 --> 28:29.885
Sure.

28:30.386 --> 28:31.553
No, you stay here.

28:33.288 --> 28:34.423
I want to talk to your wife.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.268
Right this way.

28:49.104 --> 28:50.439
A very beautiful home
you have.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.174
Thank you.

29:08.157 --> 29:09.224
Right this way.

29:09.759 --> 29:10.993
Thank you.

30:00.710 --> 30:02.511
Which side of the bed
do you sleep on?

30:05.347 --> 30:08.685
I'm not sure how that question
pertains to the investigation?

30:09.585 --> 30:10.986
It's all part of it.

30:13.522 --> 30:14.590
I sleep on the right,

30:14.623 --> 30:16.325
and my husband
sleeps on the left.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.182
Mrs. Tyler,
can you think of anyone

30:40.215 --> 30:42.217
who might want to harm you
or your husband?

30:44.386 --> 30:47.256
Why? Wasn't this
just a robbery?

30:47.289 --> 30:49.625
Well, maybe your husband
got there in time,

30:49.658 --> 30:52.494
but in a robbery,
usually something gets stolen.

31:05.107 --> 31:08.343
Mr. Tyler? Mr. Tyler.

31:09.578 --> 31:11.413
Mr. Tyler, are you all right?

31:13.215 --> 31:14.216
You seem nervous.

31:17.352 --> 31:19.621
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little bit shaky.

31:20.556 --> 31:22.257
That's understandable.

31:22.291 --> 31:24.159
You've had
a big shock tonight.

31:25.862 --> 31:27.129
Yes, I have.

31:28.798 --> 31:31.667
And from what it looks like,
you fought back pretty hard.

31:33.502 --> 31:35.470
A man was in my house
with a gun.

31:37.606 --> 31:39.274
I would have killed him
if I had to.

31:44.313 --> 31:45.782
Don't hesitate
to give me a call...

31:47.649 --> 31:49.251
if you have any information

31:49.284 --> 31:50.720
pertaining to
the investigation.

31:53.522 --> 31:54.656
Thank you for your time.

31:55.557 --> 31:56.658
I'll be in touch.

32:28.457 --> 32:30.459
Last time you played
<i>Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,</i>

32:30.492 --> 32:31.761
it sounded pretty good.

32:32.695 --> 32:34.196
Put a little beatbox under it.

32:35.497 --> 32:37.332
All right, here's your
favorite part. Here we go.

32:39.301 --> 32:41.637
Mr. Hopps ready
to go for a ride?

32:41.670 --> 32:44.206
Mmm-hmm.
- Go. All right.

32:44.239 --> 32:46.341
And I want your fingers
nice and loose.

32:46.375 --> 32:47.643
Nice and...

32:48.410 --> 32:49.544
- Flexible.
- Hmm.

32:49.578 --> 32:51.881
I want you to rock out
on that <i>Twinkle, Twinkle...</i>

32:51.914 --> 32:53.448
- Carter.
- All right?

33:06.461 --> 33:07.496
I'll handle it.

33:08.765 --> 33:09.899
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:09.932 --> 33:11.433
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.777
You can't be here.
You know that.

33:20.810 --> 33:21.911
What are you doing?

33:23.680 --> 33:26.381
I'm not asking for custody.

33:26.415 --> 33:27.684
I just want to be
a part of her life.

33:27.717 --> 33:29.584
You lost the right
to be a part of her life.

33:30.887 --> 33:31.954
It was an accident.

33:31.988 --> 33:33.990
It was drunken negligence.

33:34.023 --> 33:35.758
I've been sober
since the accident.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.797
She doesn't even know
who you are anymore.

33:40.830 --> 33:42.899
Give me visitation rights,
please?

33:44.366 --> 33:47.302
I've completely
cleaned up my life

33:47.335 --> 33:49.471
and it's been
three years now. I'm...

33:49.504 --> 33:51.540
In clear violation
of the restraining order.

33:53.408 --> 33:54.844
It's a hundred yards, asshole.

33:58.313 --> 34:02.250
That's as close as you're ever
going to get to her.

34:02.284 --> 34:04.887
Now, let me make something
absolutely clear to you.

34:06.621 --> 34:09.792
You are never going to be
her mother again.

34:11.293 --> 34:13.228
If you come
anywhere near my family,

34:14.997 --> 34:17.299
you'll have a lot more
to worry about

34:17.332 --> 34:18.735
than a restraining order.

34:57.073 --> 34:58.406
Haley!

35:15.691 --> 35:16.759
Wait here.

36:12.014 --> 36:14.583
Mr. Tyler, how can I help you?

36:14.616 --> 36:16.451
Uh...

36:16.484 --> 36:18.855
Am I, uh, being recorded
or watched?

36:19.155 --> 36:20.823
No.

36:20.857 --> 36:23.926
Okay. I think we should...
We should talk.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.162
You have some new information
concerning the case?

36:26.195 --> 36:28.898
- No.
- Then?

36:28.931 --> 36:31.734
Well, I want to know
what's going on here.

36:31.767 --> 36:33.535
What do you mean?
You're the victim of a crime.

36:33.568 --> 36:34.770
I'm investigating the crime.

36:35.171 --> 36:36.806
Right. Um...

36:41.010 --> 36:44.914
What I want to know is,
what's happening with us?

36:45.982 --> 36:48.450
You're afraid I'm going to
expose you to your wife?

36:49.051 --> 36:50.086
Are you?

36:50.119 --> 36:51.519
Think it through.

36:51.553 --> 36:53.555
I expose you, you expose me.

36:53.588 --> 36:54.891
Last thing I need
is for my colleagues to know

36:54.924 --> 36:56.158
what I do in my private life.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.794
Okay.

36:59.561 --> 37:01.030
Um...

37:01.063 --> 37:03.565
I just wanted
to make sure that,

37:03.598 --> 37:05.001
you know, things are straight.

37:05.667 --> 37:08.170
Um, I also wanted to apologize

37:08.204 --> 37:11.707
and make it clear
that what happened...

37:11.741 --> 37:13.608
Was the first time
you ever cheated on your wife.

37:15.811 --> 37:18.546
I get it. You want me to know
you're a decent guy.

37:24.186 --> 37:26.756
Look, I have a marriage
to protect.

37:26.789 --> 37:30.026
And Tracie and I are good now.

37:31.961 --> 37:33.162
But not before?

37:34.096 --> 37:35.131
Before?

37:35.164 --> 37:37.133
In Vegas,

37:37.166 --> 37:39.601
when you weren't wearing
your wedding ring

37:39.634 --> 37:41.938
and your name
was Darren Johnson?

37:41.971 --> 37:48.443
Have to say, you are
one very convincing liar.

37:51.881 --> 37:54.016
- I thought...
- What?

37:55.952 --> 37:57.485
I thought
we were playing a game.

37:57.519 --> 37:58.921
- A game?
- A game.

37:58.955 --> 38:01.757
Like, it's Vegas.

38:01.791 --> 38:03.491
There's... You know,
what happens in Vegas...

38:03.525 --> 38:04.727
A game.

38:08.663 --> 38:11.067
I... I am... I'm sorry.

38:14.203 --> 38:15.237
You're sorry?

38:16.238 --> 38:19.875
You're sorry you got caught
in your own lies.

38:19.909 --> 38:23.813
You know, our actions have
very serious repercussions,

38:23.846 --> 38:25.748
especially when they damage
other people.

38:27.016 --> 38:28.050
I never...

38:34.790 --> 38:36.158
Oh, shit.

38:36.192 --> 38:37.827
Oh...

38:37.860 --> 38:38.928
You deserved that.

38:41.998 --> 38:43.833
So, let me tell you
what you want to hear.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.803
Our time in Vegas
has no bearing on this case

38:47.837 --> 38:49.705
or on my ability
to be professional.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.042
I'm a decorated officer.

38:53.075 --> 38:54.609
I've the best arrest

38:54.642 --> 38:57.146
and conviction record
in the department.

38:57.179 --> 39:01.317
And I will figure out
who broke into your house.

39:01.350 --> 39:03.618
And in the meantime, I have to
advise you to be careful.

39:04.086 --> 39:05.921
Why?

39:05.955 --> 39:08.024
It might have been
an attempted hit.

39:10.860 --> 39:11.861
A hit?

39:14.330 --> 39:16.531
I, um...

39:18.134 --> 39:20.770
Like someone's
trying to murder...

39:20.803 --> 39:24.774
Okay. Um, I run a respectable
sports agency.

39:24.807 --> 39:25.975
I deal with athletes.

39:26.008 --> 39:27.910
I don't deal
with nefarious characters.

39:27.943 --> 39:29.945
- Why would...
- I don't know.

39:29.979 --> 39:32.114
It's for you to answer.

39:32.148 --> 39:34.316
Maybe someone you screwed over
in a business deal?

39:34.350 --> 39:35.985
A woman you screwed
and discarded?

39:38.620 --> 39:39.955
Why don't you take some time
to think it over

39:39.989 --> 39:41.924
and get back to me?

39:41.957 --> 39:43.325
Otherwise,
I think we're done here.

39:44.727 --> 39:45.728
Darren...

39:46.829 --> 39:47.930
from Seattle.

40:27.002 --> 40:28.871
<i>Innocent of these allegations.</i>

40:28.904 --> 40:30.840
<i>I look forward
to my day in court.</i>

40:30.873 --> 40:33.008
<i>Listen, there are two versions
to every story,</i>

40:33.042 --> 40:34.176
<i>there's their side,
and there's the truth.</i>

40:49.125 --> 40:50.159
Tracie?

40:52.962 --> 40:53.996
Trace?

41:00.436 --> 41:01.804
- Yeah.
- Hey.

41:01.837 --> 41:03.973
Oh, hi, honey.

41:04.006 --> 41:05.673
You remember
Detective Quinlan, right?

41:07.710 --> 41:09.311
Am I interrupting something?

41:15.851 --> 41:18.653
Any news regarding the case?

41:19.088 --> 41:20.689
No, I just...

41:20.723 --> 41:23.092
I wanted to see your place
in the light of day.

41:23.125 --> 41:24.927
Maybe find something

41:24.960 --> 41:27.129
we might've missed
the first time.

41:27.163 --> 41:29.064
You know,
what you see in the night

41:29.098 --> 41:30.833
isn't always
what you see in the day.

41:32.301 --> 41:33.369
Um...

41:33.402 --> 41:34.303
I'm sorry, I need to go.

41:34.336 --> 41:36.839
I have a house to show
down at the beach.

41:36.872 --> 41:40.042
All right, well,
I think that I'm done here.

41:40.075 --> 41:42.077
Uh, unless there's anything
you remember

41:42.111 --> 41:43.345
that you want
to share with us?

41:47.983 --> 41:51.353
No. No, I think I...
When I saw you here,

41:51.387 --> 41:53.489
I thought you had
already caught the guy.

41:53.522 --> 41:55.191
No, but we'll catch him.

41:55.958 --> 41:57.059
You sure about that?

41:57.092 --> 41:59.828
I don't go after something
unless I know I can get it.

42:04.433 --> 42:07.169
Thank you for your time.
I'll see myself out.

42:09.438 --> 42:10.773
Straight down.

42:13.943 --> 42:16.011
Well, what time, uh...

42:16.045 --> 42:17.346
What time you think
you'll be back?

42:17.379 --> 42:19.281
You know these clients.

42:20.950 --> 42:23.252
Who knows, but I'll be late,
don't wait up.

42:27.790 --> 42:29.124
Drive safe.

42:38.867 --> 42:43.739
I hate to
ask this, but I gotta.

42:47.243 --> 42:48.244
You talked to Tyrin?

42:49.812 --> 42:51.013
Are you trying to be funny?

42:51.046 --> 42:54.383
He knows your house.
He knows the layout.

42:54.416 --> 42:55.451
You know,
he could have been talking

42:55.484 --> 42:56.485
with his low-life friends,

42:56.518 --> 42:58.220
telling them about
his rich cousin. It's just...

42:58.254 --> 43:00.923
Hey, hey, you...
Way, way off base.

43:01.890 --> 43:03.325
Just...

43:03.359 --> 43:05.060
Just leave Tyrin out of this.

43:08.364 --> 43:09.498
And this lady cop,

43:11.300 --> 43:13.002
she didn't say anything
about Vegas?

43:13.035 --> 43:15.271
No, I think
she just gets a kick

43:15.304 --> 43:16.772
out of watching me sweat.

43:21.010 --> 43:22.044
I fucked up.

43:24.213 --> 43:25.381
I fucked up.

43:28.584 --> 43:29.985
Oh, I fucked up.

43:40.329 --> 43:41.230
<i>Detective Quinlan,</i>

43:41.263 --> 43:43.299
<i>this is Schroeder
calling you back.</i>

43:43.332 --> 43:45.200
<i>At your request,
we took another look</i>

43:45.234 --> 43:46.935
<i>at the Tyler house,</i>

43:46.969 --> 43:48.370
<i>and we were able to ascertain</i>

43:48.404 --> 43:50.873
<i>that there was
no forced entry.</i>

43:50.906 --> 43:53.008
<i>We managed to recover
a half-print,</i>

43:53.042 --> 43:55.010
<i>but I can tell you
this much, Detective,</i>

43:55.044 --> 43:57.146
<i>whoever came into this house</i>

43:57.179 --> 43:59.415
<i>had direct access
to the Tyler estate.</i>

44:10.359 --> 44:12.494
Yo. I just closed
the Taylor deal, man.

44:14.630 --> 44:15.799
Congrats.

44:17.032 --> 44:18.067
I'm headed to the gym.

44:18.100 --> 44:19.968
- You want to roll?
- Uh, no, thanks.

44:20.336 --> 44:21.337
You sure?

44:26.508 --> 44:27.943
Work-life balance, D.

44:41.357 --> 44:43.225
<i>I look
forward to my day in court.</i>

44:43.258 --> 44:44.893
<i>This is a political hit job.</i>

44:44.927 --> 44:46.895
<i>I've been receiving
death threats.</i>

44:46.929 --> 44:48.597
<i>I don't appreciate this.</i>

44:48.630 --> 44:50.933
<i>I would like to express my...</i>

45:03.112 --> 45:04.179
Derrick.

45:05.614 --> 45:06.515
What do you want?

45:06.548 --> 45:08.250
There's been a break
in the case. Get in.

45:14.990 --> 45:16.225
Get in the car.

45:45.320 --> 45:46.488
Just a little further.

45:49.358 --> 45:50.426
You've been here before?

45:51.226 --> 45:52.394
No.

45:52.428 --> 45:53.996
Is there a reason
why I should have?

45:55.063 --> 45:57.132
Okay, use this.

45:57.166 --> 46:00.703
It's the fourth house
to the left,

46:00.737 --> 46:03.405
check out the big room
at the top on the right,

46:03.439 --> 46:04.707
just off the balcony.

46:12.247 --> 46:14.016
What am I looking for here?

46:14.049 --> 46:15.150
Keep watching.

46:25.127 --> 46:26.528
It's, uh, my business partner.

46:26.562 --> 46:27.629
I know.

46:49.786 --> 46:52.521
What the fuck? What...

47:05.634 --> 47:08.403
The house is a rental property
your wife handles.

47:22.451 --> 47:23.585
How long?

47:24.520 --> 47:25.587
Don't know.

47:28.457 --> 47:29.692
You followed my wife.

47:31.828 --> 47:34.396
That's why I was at your house
the other day.

47:34.429 --> 47:37.199
I knew something was wrong.

47:37.232 --> 47:39.434
So I decided to see
what she does with her day.

47:46.375 --> 47:47.777
Fuck. Fuck!

47:49.879 --> 47:51.313
Don't go back there.

47:58.287 --> 47:59.722
All right, look,
you had your fun.

48:01.824 --> 48:03.158
Leave me alone.

48:03.693 --> 48:04.761
There's more.

48:04.794 --> 48:06.228
Leave me the fuck alone!

48:08.463 --> 48:09.832
You need to call me
when you're ready.

48:56.612 --> 48:58.715
Jesus.
Didn't you get the memo?

48:58.748 --> 49:00.750
I mean, what the fuck
are you doing here?

49:00.783 --> 49:02.317
Don't worry, Carter,
I know Haley's not here.

49:03.318 --> 49:04.787
You're watching my house, Val?

49:04.821 --> 49:06.355
You know, I'm done.
I'm done with you.

49:06.388 --> 49:09.558
Look, I've asked my attorney
to petition the court.

49:09.591 --> 49:12.729
I'm asking for custody
until your inquest is over,

49:12.762 --> 49:14.363
and he thinks
I have a good shot.

49:14.396 --> 49:16.498
If you really want to do
what's best for Haley,

49:16.531 --> 49:18.901
you'll sign off on this, okay?

49:18.935 --> 49:20.235
And that way, we can avoid

49:20.268 --> 49:21.336
dragging her
through this hearing.

49:21.370 --> 49:23.438
You really think
you'll get custody?

49:23.472 --> 49:25.908
I mean, you really think
I'd let that happen?

49:28.410 --> 49:30.379
You got to the judge,
didn't you?

49:30.412 --> 49:32.314
I could get to anybody
in the city.

49:32.347 --> 49:33.482
Your attorney knows it.

49:33.515 --> 49:34.817
And the only one who doesn't
is you.

49:34.851 --> 49:36.551
So, wake up, Val.

49:36.585 --> 49:38.186
You're never getting
Haley back.

49:38.220 --> 49:39.122
- No.
- No. No.

49:39.154 --> 49:40.690
You're going to prison.
I'll get her back.

49:40.723 --> 49:41.858
I'm not going anywhere.

49:41.891 --> 49:43.793
Look,
this inquest is bullshit.

49:43.826 --> 49:44.827
They can't take me down.

49:44.861 --> 49:45.762
I'll take the rest of
City Hall down with me.

49:45.795 --> 49:48.731
I know where all the bodies
are buried.

49:48.765 --> 49:52.735
Look, if it's any consolation,
you were never going to win.

49:53.836 --> 49:55.203
Game was rigged.

49:59.274 --> 50:01.343
Now get the fuck out of my way
before I run you over.

50:31.741 --> 50:32.975
<i>Hi.</i>

50:33.009 --> 50:34.676
You said there was more.

50:36.746 --> 50:38.580
Where do we meet?

51:32.667 --> 51:33.970
I'll get you a glass for that.

51:48.851 --> 51:51.586
I didn't take pleasure
in showing you that scene.

51:52.822 --> 51:54.523
I just thought you should
see it for yourself.

52:08.403 --> 52:12.374
I called you because you said
there was more.

52:15.711 --> 52:17.747
Rafe Grimes was the one
who tried to kill you.

52:21.150 --> 52:22.819
You got to be outta your mind.

52:22.852 --> 52:24.020
They...

52:24.053 --> 52:26.823
They tried to make it look like
a home invasion gone bad.

52:27.890 --> 52:29.792
- They?
- Tracie.

52:31.093 --> 52:32.494
They're in it together.

52:36.132 --> 52:38.734
That... You know, that...

52:39.601 --> 52:40.970
That sounds crazy.

52:42.705 --> 52:44.639
How much is your agency worth?

52:44.673 --> 52:47.777
If you die, what...

52:47.810 --> 52:50.445
Tracie gets half that?
Rafe gets the rest?

52:51.681 --> 52:53.049
No.

52:55.718 --> 52:57.552
No, there's... Is there...

52:58.788 --> 53:01.456
You're making this up,
there's no proof.

53:01.489 --> 53:03.059
Why didn't she call 911?

53:04.894 --> 53:06.461
When she heard the gunshots?

53:07.763 --> 53:09.431
Why did she go upstairs
herself?

53:13.568 --> 53:14.669
She wanted to...

53:16.072 --> 53:17.439
She wanted to help me.

53:18.774 --> 53:20.609
They're bad people, Derrick.

53:20.642 --> 53:22.111
She's fucking
your best friend.

53:23.779 --> 53:25.715
This is my job.

53:25.748 --> 53:27.549
I know how this goes.

53:27.582 --> 53:29.118
They're guilty, Derrick.

53:36.692 --> 53:37.960
It's okay.

53:37.994 --> 53:39.829
All right, I'll clean this up.

54:02.985 --> 54:04.653
You know, if they tried
to kill you once,

54:04.687 --> 54:05.821
they'll try again.

54:07.089 --> 54:08.590
You have to protect yourself.

54:13.829 --> 54:15.530
- How?
- Well...

54:16.564 --> 54:18.134
you could always
kill them first.

54:25.507 --> 54:29.145
With how I'm feeling
right now, don't tempt me.

54:37.119 --> 54:38.520
They tried to kill you.

54:40.122 --> 54:41.791
- How does that make you feel?
- Angry.

54:42.792 --> 54:44.226
Very fucking angry.

54:46.295 --> 54:47.763
And what do you wanna do
about it?

54:54.136 --> 54:55.905
What do you wanna do about it
right now?

56:42.945 --> 56:45.047
<i>You really think
you'll get custody?</i>

56:45.081 --> 56:46.949
<i>You really think
I'd let that happen?</i>

56:46.982 --> 56:50.019
<i>You are never going to be
her mother.</i>

56:50.052 --> 56:51.987
<i>You got to the judge,
didn't you?</i>

56:52.021 --> 56:54.290
<i>I can get to anybody
in the city.</i>

56:54.323 --> 56:55.858
<i>I thought
we were playing a game.</i>

56:55.891 --> 56:57.359
<i>A game?</i>

57:59.121 --> 58:01.123
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

58:23.979 --> 58:25.014
You Derrick Tyler?

58:26.282 --> 58:27.483
Yeah. What's wrong?

58:27.516 --> 58:29.051
You need to come with us,
Mr. Tyler.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.154
Why?

58:32.188 --> 58:33.756
I'm not at liberty
to say, sir.

58:33.789 --> 58:35.424
Just grab a few things.
Come on with us.

58:53.842 --> 58:55.177
The fuck am I doing here?

58:55.211 --> 58:56.812
My partners
will be here any minute.

58:58.280 --> 59:01.050
If you want me to help you,
you gotta be honest with me.

59:02.851 --> 59:04.386
Did you do it?

59:04.420 --> 59:05.487
Did I do what?

59:05.521 --> 59:08.224
What are you talking about?
Why... Why am I here?

59:08.257 --> 59:09.525
Did you do it?

59:09.558 --> 59:12.394
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

59:54.436 --> 59:55.804
Baby...

1:00:01.543 --> 1:00:03.045
They're dead like you wanted.

1:00:07.316 --> 1:00:09.151
I... I didn't...

1:00:12.554 --> 1:00:14.490
No. I didn't...
I didn't do this.

1:00:16.558 --> 1:00:18.327
I didn't. I didn't do this.

1:00:18.360 --> 1:00:19.561
You left my place

1:00:19.595 --> 1:00:22.831
three hours
before the murders took place.

1:00:22.865 --> 1:00:25.167
That's plenty of time
to drive to the beach...

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:27.603
- I didn't... God, I didn't.
- ...and kill them.

1:00:27.636 --> 1:00:29.104
I didn't kill my wife.
I didn't...

1:00:36.478 --> 1:00:37.479
You know,
there's the...

1:00:38.914 --> 1:00:39.948
matter of your...

1:00:41.250 --> 1:00:42.885
buried past.

1:00:42.918 --> 1:00:45.854
Arrest as a minor
for auto theft.

1:00:45.888 --> 1:00:47.122
Breaking and entering.

1:00:47.156 --> 1:00:48.324
There's even a charge here of...

1:00:49.491 --> 1:00:51.994
armed robbery
with a deadly weapon.

1:00:52.027 --> 1:00:53.395
Liquor store.

1:00:53.429 --> 1:00:55.497
That charge was dropped.

1:00:55.531 --> 1:00:59.201
Well, because your cousin...
Wait, let's see, um... Tyrin,

1:00:59.234 --> 1:01:01.470
he came forward
and cut a deal,

1:01:01.503 --> 1:01:03.539
took full responsibility.

1:01:03.572 --> 1:01:05.941
And that, I think,
allowed you the ability

1:01:05.974 --> 1:01:08.210
to get
a basketball scholarship

1:01:08.243 --> 1:01:09.845
and get your ass
out of the projects.

1:01:12.548 --> 1:01:14.316
Don't lie to me, Derrick.

1:01:14.350 --> 1:01:15.884
I am not a murderer.

1:01:15.918 --> 1:01:18.354
Just a businessman.
Just a ball player.

1:01:18.387 --> 1:01:19.922
Practically a celebrity.

1:01:21.390 --> 1:01:24.093
And celebrities don't
commit murders, right?

1:01:26.929 --> 1:01:28.263
It was at the scene.

1:01:32.067 --> 1:01:34.336
Hopefully, I can keep you
from getting indicted.

1:01:34.370 --> 1:01:37.473
- I didn't do it.
- But I need you to tell me everything.

1:01:37.506 --> 1:01:39.074
You went back there,
didn't you?

1:01:39.908 --> 1:01:42.277
- I didn't.
- And don't you fucking lie.

1:01:42.311 --> 1:01:46.081
- I didn't do it.
- Did you go back there or didn't you?

1:01:48.283 --> 1:01:49.885
That's what I thought.

1:01:56.258 --> 1:01:57.459
I had to know.

1:02:07.302 --> 1:02:08.570
I, uh...

1:02:10.973 --> 1:02:13.575
I had to see it
for myself. And...

1:02:57.687 --> 1:02:59.154
D...

1:03:01.290 --> 1:03:02.624
I'm so sorry.

1:03:05.160 --> 1:03:06.228
Just...

1:03:27.349 --> 1:03:28.718
Don't act so surprised.

1:03:50.272 --> 1:03:51.406
And then you did it.

1:03:58.247 --> 1:04:00.717
You went back to your car,
got a gun.

1:04:03.753 --> 1:04:05.387
<i>You went back
to that bedroom...</i>

1:04:07.256 --> 1:04:08.457
<i>and you killed them.</i>

1:04:30.212 --> 1:04:31.681
I didn't...

1:04:31.714 --> 1:04:33.582
You got to believe me.
I didn't kill them.

1:04:43.458 --> 1:04:44.660
I think we're done here.

1:05:09.384 --> 1:05:10.485
<i>Well, I'll just say this.</i>

1:05:10.519 --> 1:05:12.654
<i>I think this is just another
unfortunate example</i>

1:05:12.689 --> 1:05:17.125
<i>of an African American male
being hung and burned</i>

1:05:17.159 --> 1:05:19.261
<i>in the Lynch Court
of public opinion.</i>

1:05:19.294 --> 1:05:20.596
<i>My client, Mr. Tyler,</i>

1:05:20.629 --> 1:05:22.699
<i>has not even been given
a trial yet,</i>

1:05:22.732 --> 1:05:24.734
<i>and yet he's being treated
as a criminal.</i>

1:05:33.241 --> 1:05:34.610
<i>That notwithstanding though,</i>

1:05:34.643 --> 1:05:36.846
<i>these are two of the people
closest to him.</i>

1:05:36.879 --> 1:05:40.148
<i>Is there any reasoning,
any alibi you could give us</i>

1:05:40.182 --> 1:05:42.852
<i>as to why he isn't the one
we should be questioning?</i>

1:05:42.885 --> 1:05:43.886
<i>I'm not really at liberty</i>

1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:46.188
<i>to go into any of those
specifics right now,</i>

1:05:46.221 --> 1:05:48.323
<i>but as I said, the evidence
will speak for itself,</i>

1:05:48.357 --> 1:05:50.258
<i>and we're confident that, uh,</i>

1:05:50.292 --> 1:05:51.526
<i>the record
will be set straight.</i>

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:52.628
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1:05:59.267 --> 1:06:01.303
Mr. Tyler, we...

1:06:01.336 --> 1:06:02.739
We didn't think
we'd see you this week.

1:06:06.208 --> 1:06:08.176
Are Carrie and Patrick here?

1:06:08.210 --> 1:06:12.481
Uh, no, no, they haven't been
coming in since the news.

1:06:22.959 --> 1:06:24.393
Go home.

1:06:45.647 --> 1:06:47.249
<i>As we
told you before the break...</i>

1:06:47.282 --> 1:06:48.885
<i>...continue
as the city council</i>

1:06:48.918 --> 1:06:51.653
- <i>responded to bribery...</i>
- <i>...buries his wife, Tracie Tyler,</i>

1:06:51.688 --> 1:06:53.522
<i>and the public fallout
from this shocking</i>

1:06:53.555 --> 1:06:55.257
<i>double homicide continues.</i>

1:06:55.290 --> 1:06:57.626
<i>Mr. Tyler's once-thriving
management company</i>

1:06:57.659 --> 1:06:59.361
<i>is losing clients by the hour,</i>

1:06:59.394 --> 1:07:02.799
<i>while the public openly
vilifies this grieving husband</i>

1:07:02.832 --> 1:07:05.667
<i>who is yet to stand trial
or face criminal charges.</i>

1:07:05.702 --> 1:07:07.235
<i>More on this to come.</i>

1:07:20.348 --> 1:07:21.516
Take Mom inside.

1:07:35.898 --> 1:07:37.566
How was the funeral?

1:07:37.599 --> 1:07:39.367
What do you want?

1:07:39.401 --> 1:07:42.038
Can't I stop by to offer
my condolences for your loss?

1:07:42.071 --> 1:07:43.773
My family's here.

1:07:43.806 --> 1:07:45.240
It's not a good time.

1:07:47.342 --> 1:07:48.443
All right.

1:07:53.448 --> 1:07:55.584
You should know you've gone
from person of interest

1:07:55.617 --> 1:07:56.786
to prime suspect.

1:07:59.588 --> 1:08:00.690
No.

1:08:01.891 --> 1:08:03.291
No.

1:08:06.428 --> 1:08:08.698
Yeah. They're gonna indict you
any day now.

1:08:08.731 --> 1:08:09.866
I didn't do it!

1:08:09.899 --> 1:08:11.399
DA doesn't care.

1:08:11.433 --> 1:08:12.601
So, find the killer!

1:08:13.602 --> 1:08:16.404
Well, that's complicated.

1:08:16.438 --> 1:08:20.475
I mean, who's the real killer
in a situation like this?

1:08:20.509 --> 1:08:22.644
The one who pulls the trigger
or the one that wants it done?

1:08:38.828 --> 1:08:39.962
Oh, shit.

1:08:42.031 --> 1:08:43.065
You killed them.

1:08:47.003 --> 1:08:48.503
No one's gonna believe you.

1:08:51.808 --> 1:08:53.009
You killed them.

1:08:55.443 --> 1:08:56.813
Why?

1:08:56.846 --> 1:08:58.446
You need
to get some rest, Derrick.

1:09:00.716 --> 1:09:01.918
I'll be in touch.

1:09:01.951 --> 1:09:03.351
No, you...

1:09:03.385 --> 1:09:05.054
Hey, hey!

1:09:06.555 --> 1:09:08.490
I could kill you right now
in self-defense.

1:09:09.859 --> 1:09:11.359
Then all your problems
would be over.

1:09:19.668 --> 1:09:21.503
Now, go back inside

1:09:21.536 --> 1:09:23.672
and play the sad,
bereaving husband

1:09:23.706 --> 1:09:26.843
of the wife who loved him
so much, she wanted him dead.

1:10:25.034 --> 1:10:26.068
How is she?

1:10:27.737 --> 1:10:28.971
Mom is strong.

1:10:30.706 --> 1:10:33.142
But she's not made of steel.

1:10:33.175 --> 1:10:36.045
You know, she stopped going
to the church and the market.

1:10:36.078 --> 1:10:39.849
Everywhere she go,
"Your son's a murderer."

1:10:43.753 --> 1:10:46.022
All right. Thanks.

1:10:59.634 --> 1:11:00.703
Hey, Mom.

1:11:03.139 --> 1:11:05.074
Hi.

1:11:05.107 --> 1:11:07.509
You are a good man.

1:11:07.542 --> 1:11:08.911
We all know
you didn't do this.

1:11:08.945 --> 1:11:12.214
I know you did not do this.

1:11:12.248 --> 1:11:15.184
I never thought
in a million years

1:11:15.217 --> 1:11:17.920
that I'll be having
this conversation with you.

1:11:17.954 --> 1:11:19.889
I'm here...

1:11:19.922 --> 1:11:22.892
and I'll always be here
till the day I die.

1:11:22.925 --> 1:11:25.061
This wasn't
a part of the plan.

1:11:26.762 --> 1:11:28.230
You know, I worked hard.
I didn't...

1:11:29.298 --> 1:11:31.000
I didn't take any shortcuts.

1:11:33.635 --> 1:11:35.037
Now...

1:11:38.274 --> 1:11:39.742
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

1:11:41.676 --> 1:11:43.279
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1:11:43.312 --> 1:11:44.914
You're gonna hold your head up.

1:11:44.947 --> 1:11:46.148
You're gonna
put your shoulders back,

1:11:46.182 --> 1:11:49.752
and you're gonna figure out
some kinda way to get it done.

1:11:49.785 --> 1:11:53.889
What is the most precious
thing you own, Derrick?

1:11:54.890 --> 1:11:56.926
Your name!

1:11:56.959 --> 1:11:58.560
And they can't take it
from you

1:11:58.593 --> 1:12:00.562
unless you give it away.
So, you gotta fight.

1:12:00.595 --> 1:12:02.965
You gotta get up every day
and fight for it.

1:12:05.567 --> 1:12:06.869
Do you know I love you so?

1:12:10.272 --> 1:12:11.907
You just gotta fight.

1:12:16.278 --> 1:12:18.948
- Yeah, Mom.
- Hmm.

1:12:20.249 --> 1:12:21.951
- I love you.
- And I love you.

1:12:27.622 --> 1:12:31.093
A man's name
is a precious thing.

1:12:34.662 --> 1:12:36.265
Go clear your name, son.

1:12:47.376 --> 1:12:48.978
<i>I gotta be smarter
than her.</i>

1:12:49.979 --> 1:12:51.947
So, she's crazy and obsessed.

1:12:51.981 --> 1:12:53.249
Yeah.

1:12:54.984 --> 1:12:56.318
I don't know what she wants.

1:12:56.352 --> 1:12:57.787
I don't know...

1:12:59.288 --> 1:13:01.157
what her real motive is.

1:13:01.190 --> 1:13:03.025
Leave it to me.

1:13:03.059 --> 1:13:04.693
I don't wanna do that.

1:13:04.727 --> 1:13:07.696
D, the cops
speak a different language.

1:13:08.697 --> 1:13:09.999
You don't speak that no more.

1:13:10.933 --> 1:13:16.338
I do. Look at you.
Got that Steph Curry eyes

1:13:16.372 --> 1:13:19.108
with that
Jesus of Nazareth hair.

1:13:19.141 --> 1:13:21.977
Come on, man.

1:13:26.982 --> 1:13:29.051
Yeah, we came a long way,
didn't we?

1:13:29.085 --> 1:13:30.786
Yeah.

1:13:34.123 --> 1:13:35.623
I don't wanna go back.

1:13:37.393 --> 1:13:38.928
I got to play this smarter.

1:13:40.162 --> 1:13:41.629
You with me?

1:13:43.665 --> 1:13:46.668
It's an absolute no
on this, please.

1:13:46.702 --> 1:13:48.170
Can't tell me no.

1:13:48.204 --> 1:13:50.940
Do you think I want you
to go back to prison?

1:13:50.973 --> 1:13:52.408
I've got enough
on my conscience.

1:13:52.441 --> 1:13:55.077
Just promise me you're gonna
leave this woman alone.

1:13:59.849 --> 1:14:01.183
Can't promise you that.

1:15:52.294 --> 1:15:54.763
- What's up, boy?
- What's up?

1:15:54.797 --> 1:15:58.100
Your cousin Derrick,
know they got him boxed in.

1:15:58.133 --> 1:16:00.302
They gonna come get him
real soon.

1:16:00.336 --> 1:16:02.871
All over the news
every day, bro.

1:16:04.406 --> 1:16:06.308
Got to handle my business,
you know?

1:16:06.342 --> 1:16:08.777
That's all.
You got that?

1:16:14.416 --> 1:16:16.452
Shit, if you need me to
ride along, let me know.

1:16:16.485 --> 1:16:18.220
You know I'm with it.

1:16:18.254 --> 1:16:20.856
Look, man...

1:16:20.889 --> 1:16:22.558
We're dealin'
with a dirty cop.

1:16:22.591 --> 1:16:24.827
Shit could go bad, you know.

1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:26.862
We gotta do what we gotta do.

1:16:26.895 --> 1:16:28.264
I'm with you.

1:16:32.301 --> 1:16:33.469
Let's ride.

1:18:17.272 --> 1:18:19.308
Sit your ass down.

1:18:23.545 --> 1:18:24.947
Welcome home, bitch.

1:18:36.091 --> 1:18:37.292
Derrick send you?

1:18:37.326 --> 1:18:38.560
Derrick don't know I'm here.

1:18:40.429 --> 1:18:42.364
You're the cousin. Tyrin.

1:18:44.133 --> 1:18:46.635
- What do you want?
- You framed my cousin.

1:18:46.668 --> 1:18:48.270
What I'm tryin'
to figure out is, why?

1:18:50.539 --> 1:18:52.341
That's my cousin Bumpy.

1:18:52.374 --> 1:18:54.643
You know, he hates cops
just as much as I do,

1:18:54.676 --> 1:18:56.545
especially ones that
frame innocent black men.

1:18:58.681 --> 1:19:00.382
You got the balls
to kill a cop?

1:19:02.451 --> 1:19:05.053
Bitch, I will blow
your motherfucking brains out.

1:19:05.087 --> 1:19:07.389
- Please.
- Please?

1:19:07.423 --> 1:19:09.358
- Please what?
- Don't kill me.

1:19:09.391 --> 1:19:11.126
What you playin' when you were
framing my fucking cousin?

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:12.494
Man, fuck this bitch.

1:19:12.528 --> 1:19:14.396
Please. I got a daughter.

1:19:14.430 --> 1:19:16.565
Why did you frame my cousin?

1:19:16.598 --> 1:19:18.333
You gonna have a fuckin' hole
in your head

1:19:18.367 --> 1:19:20.703
if you don't start talkin'.

1:19:20.737 --> 1:19:23.372
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Stop stalling and give me some fuckin' answers, bitch!

1:19:23.405 --> 1:19:25.040
Just kill
this bitch, man.

1:19:35.484 --> 1:19:37.386
Bathroom.

1:19:42.424 --> 1:19:43.726
I need
this bitch to talk.

1:19:45.695 --> 1:19:47.262
Man, take this bitch
to the bathroom, man.

1:19:50.666 --> 1:19:52.601
Get your ass up.

1:19:52.634 --> 1:19:54.369
Don't try
nothing stupid either.

1:19:59.641 --> 1:20:02.044
No locked doors.
Stop playing with me.

1:20:02.077 --> 1:20:03.445
Hurry the fuck up.

1:20:05.447 --> 1:20:07.115
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1:20:07.149 --> 1:20:09.051
Man, hurry up
and bring her ass back!

1:20:12.154 --> 1:20:13.288
Bumpy!

1:20:15.524 --> 1:20:17.760
Bumpy!

1:20:17.794 --> 1:20:19.461
Oh, shit.

1:20:21.163 --> 1:20:22.364
Fuck!

1:20:40.717 --> 1:20:42.451
Bitch!

1:21:09.611 --> 1:21:11.113
Tyrin.

1:21:12.849 --> 1:21:14.516
<i>Time is running out.</i>

1:21:14.550 --> 1:21:16.318
<i>Meet me at the beach house.</i>

1:21:16.351 --> 1:21:17.653
<i>9:00.</i>

1:21:19.689 --> 1:21:21.356
Val?

1:22:19.949 --> 1:22:21.283
Where's Tyrin?

1:22:26.421 --> 1:22:27.757
Is he dead?

1:22:27.790 --> 1:22:29.324
It was self-defense.

1:22:30.659 --> 1:22:32.695
- You killed him.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:22:32.729 --> 1:22:35.631
They came at me,
and I put 'em down.

1:22:40.268 --> 1:22:41.436
Fuck you.

1:22:47.910 --> 1:22:49.678
Get down. Get down!

1:22:51.279 --> 1:22:52.447
Give me the gun, Derrick,

1:22:52.481 --> 1:22:53.883
before you do
something stupid.

1:22:53.916 --> 1:22:55.283
Listen to me.

1:22:55.317 --> 1:22:56.451
You fucking killed him.

1:22:56.485 --> 1:22:57.687
Listen to me.

1:22:57.720 --> 1:22:59.956
Tyrin's death
could be your ticket...

1:22:59.989 --> 1:23:02.190
Down. Down.

1:23:02.224 --> 1:23:04.226
Look, killing a cop,

1:23:04.259 --> 1:23:05.828
it's only gonna make
your problems worse.

1:23:05.862 --> 1:23:07.329
Think it through.

1:23:08.397 --> 1:23:10.465
We can pin the murders
on Tyrin.

1:23:10.499 --> 1:23:12.334
The fuck you talkin' about?

1:23:12.367 --> 1:23:13.736
Your cousin.

1:23:13.770 --> 1:23:16.706
He's an ex-con. Right?

1:23:16.739 --> 1:23:18.573
With a history of violence.

1:23:18.607 --> 1:23:20.676
He's the perfect candidate,

1:23:20.710 --> 1:23:22.411
and he can't defend himself.

1:23:23.813 --> 1:23:25.547
You want me
to frame my cousin?

1:23:31.286 --> 1:23:33.488
He's a career criminal,

1:23:33.522 --> 1:23:36.893
finds out his beloved cousin's
wife is cheating on him,

1:23:36.926 --> 1:23:40.228
so he follows her to a
rendezvous with her boyfriend

1:23:40.262 --> 1:23:41.831
and caps 'em both.

1:23:41.864 --> 1:23:43.432
Then he figures out
I'm getting close,

1:23:43.465 --> 1:23:44.934
so he comes to my place
to kill me.

1:23:47.436 --> 1:23:48.771
I can sell that, Derrick.

1:23:50.907 --> 1:23:52.875
Think about it.

1:23:52.909 --> 1:23:55.377
What makes you think
I'm gonna go along with this?

1:23:56.678 --> 1:23:58.313
'Cause it's your way out.

1:24:00.382 --> 1:24:02.284
You should take it.

1:24:02.317 --> 1:24:03.753
It gets you off the hook.

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:12.995
You're a fucking psychopath.

1:24:14.396 --> 1:24:15.630
Maybe.

1:24:16.699 --> 1:24:18.567
But you need me.

1:24:18.600 --> 1:24:20.368
- So, give me the gun.
- No. No.

1:24:20.402 --> 1:24:21.738
- Give me the gun.
- Just get over there.

1:24:21.771 --> 1:24:23.538
- The gun...
- Don't...

1:24:32.682 --> 1:24:33.950
See?

1:24:35.084 --> 1:24:37.519
I knew you could kill.

1:24:37.552 --> 1:24:39.822
I just had to be sure.

1:24:39.856 --> 1:24:41.858
No blanks in this one.

1:24:41.891 --> 1:24:43.458
Drop it.

1:25:01.476 --> 1:25:02.712
I've already got
your wedding ring.

1:25:03.512 --> 1:25:05.681
The murder weapon
with your prints

1:25:05.715 --> 1:25:07.683
makes it a slam dunk.

1:25:07.717 --> 1:25:11.020
You used me in Vegas,
now I'm gonna use you.

1:25:12.587 --> 1:25:13.923
What do you want from me?

1:25:15.357 --> 1:25:16.591
I did your murders.

1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:19.461
Now you're gonna do mine.

1:25:20.897 --> 1:25:22.464
You want me to kill someone?

1:25:25.001 --> 1:25:26.535
Carter Heywood.

1:25:27.569 --> 1:25:28.738
You know who he is?

1:25:32.507 --> 1:25:33.810
Yeah.

1:25:34.844 --> 1:25:35.945
Why?

1:25:35.978 --> 1:25:39.849
He took something from me,
and I'm gonna get it back.

1:25:40.683 --> 1:25:42.450
So, you ruined my life
so that I...

1:25:42.484 --> 1:25:43.820
- Hey!
- ...could fix yours?

1:25:43.853 --> 1:25:45.420
I don't need you
to understand.

1:25:45.453 --> 1:25:46.889
Just fucking listen to me!

1:25:50.793 --> 1:25:53.729
Carter, he leaves his house at
exactly 6:00 a.m. every morning

1:25:53.763 --> 1:25:55.363
to go running.

1:25:55.397 --> 1:25:58.400
His path takes him to the
Weisser Tunnel in Brookside

1:25:58.433 --> 1:25:59.568
at exactly 6:15.

1:25:59.601 --> 1:26:01.103
You're gonna be waiting at
the north end of the tunnel.

1:26:01.137 --> 1:26:03.840
You're gonna kill him, and you're
gonna toss the gun in the storm drain.

1:26:05.174 --> 1:26:07.977
If Carter isn't dead
by 6:15 a.m. tomorrow morning,

1:26:09.045 --> 1:26:11.546
the weapon that killed
Tracie Tyler and Rafe Grimes

1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:13.149
will be discovered.

1:26:13.182 --> 1:26:14.750
And Derrick Tyler,

1:26:14.784 --> 1:26:16.853
has-been athlete
and big-time sports agent,

1:26:16.886 --> 1:26:18.287
will be convicted
of a double homicide

1:26:18.321 --> 1:26:20.857
and spend the rest of his life in
prison, telling all the other cons

1:26:20.890 --> 1:26:23.425
what it's like to hang out
with Shaq.

1:26:23.458 --> 1:26:26.361
Do this, the gun goes away,
and I hang all the other murders on Tyrin.

1:26:28.530 --> 1:26:30.432
And just like that,
Derrick gets his life back.

1:26:31.433 --> 1:26:33.602
Stay at home tonight.

1:26:33.635 --> 1:26:35.137
The gun to kill Carter
will be delivered.

1:26:37.539 --> 1:26:39.008
Got it?

1:26:41.543 --> 1:26:43.012
Now get the fuck out!

1:28:09.031 --> 1:28:10.933
Carter?

1:28:10.967 --> 1:28:12.768
Hey, Carter. Carter. Listen.

1:28:12.802 --> 1:28:15.805
- Do I know you, man?
- No, but I got to talk to you. Just listen.

1:28:15.838 --> 1:28:17.273
Get your fucking hands
off me, man.

1:28:17.306 --> 1:28:20.176
- Get back! Easy, easy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. Take it easy, man.

1:28:20.209 --> 1:28:22.577
Detective Valerie Quinlan,
right?

1:28:22.610 --> 1:28:24.747
She's your ex-wife?

1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:27.649
Is she your ex-wife?

1:28:27.683 --> 1:28:29.986
- Yeah.
- She killed my wife.

1:28:31.619 --> 1:28:33.555
And she's framing me for it.

1:28:33.588 --> 1:28:35.725
- She wants you dead, man.
- What?

1:28:35.758 --> 1:28:39.061
She wants you dead,
but I've got a plan.

1:28:39.095 --> 1:28:40.329
She sent you down here
to kill me?

1:28:40.363 --> 1:28:44.499
- I got to make it look...
- Pull a gun on me? Fucker!

1:28:49.604 --> 1:28:51.240
She's trying to frame me!

1:28:51.273 --> 1:28:52.808
I need your help! No.

1:28:58.681 --> 1:29:00.182
Oh, no.

1:29:00.216 --> 1:29:02.184
No.

1:29:02.218 --> 1:29:04.920
I just wanted to talk.
I just wanted to...

1:29:06.722 --> 1:29:08.224
Oh, shit.

1:30:46.755 --> 1:30:48.357
How'd it feel?

1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:53.095
I went to warn him...

1:30:55.865 --> 1:30:57.733
that his ex-wife was crazy...

1:30:59.401 --> 1:31:01.170
and that she wanted him dead.

1:31:02.071 --> 1:31:06.909
God.
Nothing's easy with you.

1:31:06.942 --> 1:31:10.146
He jumped me,
and the gun went off.

1:31:11.447 --> 1:31:13.349
He's dead.

1:31:13.382 --> 1:31:16.318
But you did your job.

1:31:16.352 --> 1:31:18.120
I fucking hate you.

1:31:20.122 --> 1:31:23.025
There it is.
Just like I promised.

1:31:28.364 --> 1:31:31.800
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

1:31:31.834 --> 1:31:34.036
- Take it and go.
- No.

1:31:34.069 --> 1:31:35.204
No?

1:31:35.237 --> 1:31:37.239
You're gonna kill me,
aren't you?

1:31:37.273 --> 1:31:38.941
Why would I do that?

1:31:38.974 --> 1:31:41.210
Because if I'm dead,
you get the accolades,

1:31:41.243 --> 1:31:43.846
you solve the murders,
you get your daughter back.

1:31:43.879 --> 1:31:47.483
No loose ends.
Just like you like it.

1:31:47.516 --> 1:31:49.351
Then why are you here?

1:32:00.329 --> 1:32:02.865
It's because I'm the only one
who can help you now.

1:32:05.100 --> 1:32:06.969
Yeah.

1:32:24.220 --> 1:32:25.788
You're pathetic.

1:32:26.956 --> 1:32:29.191
I don't need you dead.

1:32:29.225 --> 1:32:30.893
We're both clean.

1:32:30.926 --> 1:32:33.996
You brutally murdered
four people.

1:32:34.029 --> 1:32:36.799
And I'd keep on killing if it
meant getting my daughter back.

1:32:39.335 --> 1:32:44.039
I got what I wanted,
and you got what you wanted.

1:32:44.073 --> 1:32:47.776
Now take the gun and fuck off
before I change my mind.

1:33:07.129 --> 1:33:09.398
Your daughter deserved
much better than you.

1:36:09.144 --> 1:36:11.180
What's so funny?

1:36:19.188 --> 1:36:23.325
- Got you, bitch.
- <i>I've already solved the murders by killing Tyrin.</i>

1:36:23.358 --> 1:36:25.527
<i>And now I got
my daughter back.</i>

1:36:25.561 --> 1:36:28.297
<i>I'm about to exonerate a man
who was wrongly accused.</i>

1:36:28.330 --> 1:36:33.368
- <i>We're both clean.</i>
- <i>You brutally murdered four people.</i>

1:36:33.402 --> 1:36:35.671
- <i>There is no clean.</i>
- <i>And I'd keep on killing</i>

1:36:35.705 --> 1:36:37.439
<i>if it meant
getting my daughter back.</i>

1:37:35.732 --> 1:37:38.600
<i>You're gonna do what
you did when you were a little boy.</i>

1:37:38.634 --> 1:37:40.602
<i>You're gonna
hold your head up.</i>

1:37:40.636 --> 1:37:42.538
<i>You're gonna put your shoulders
back, and you're gonna do</i>

1:37:42.571 --> 1:37:44.239
<i>whatever it takes
to get it done.</i>

1:37:52.314 --> 1:37:54.616
Put your hands in the air!

1:37:56.719 --> 1:37:58.788
<i>Go clear your name, son.</i>

1:38:02.658 --> 1:38:04.459
<i>What up, y'all?
It's Terrence J. and Angie,</i>

1:38:04.493 --> 1:38:06.328
<i>LA's official home
for hip-hop.</i>

1:38:06.361 --> 1:38:08.397
<i>That's right. Now,
y'all remember Derrick Tyler?</i>

1:38:08.430 --> 1:38:10.499
<i>The former sports star
turned business mogul</i>

1:38:10.532 --> 1:38:13.168
<i>who was a prime suspect
in that double homicide?</i>

1:38:13.201 --> 1:38:14.469
<i>Yeah.
If The Shade Room</i>

1:38:14.503 --> 1:38:16.271
<i>said he's guilty,
that man is guilty.</i>

1:38:16.305 --> 1:38:18.607
<i>Today, he walking out
a free man.</i>

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:21.643
<i>You mean to tell
me an innocent black man got let off?</i>

1:38:21.677 --> 1:38:24.513
<i>That's right, because
your boy came with receipts.</i>

1:38:24.546 --> 1:38:26.883
<i>A taped confession
from Detective Quinlan</i>

1:38:26.916 --> 1:38:29.284
<i>officially vindicating
Derrick Tyler.</i>

1:38:29.318 --> 1:38:30.753
<i>All right,
I've learned two things.</i>

1:38:30.787 --> 1:38:33.655
<i>One, we gotta stop
making people guilty</i>

1:38:33.690 --> 1:38:35.557
- <i>before they actually are.</i>
- <i>Amen.</i>

1:38:35.591 --> 1:38:37.860
<i>And two,
if you're gonna cheat on your wife,</i>

1:38:37.894 --> 1:38:39.528
<i>make sure it's not a cop.</i>

1:38:39.561 --> 1:38:41.263
<i>Just don't cheat, boys.</i>
