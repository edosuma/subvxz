A cute joke?

07:50.020 --> 07:50.720
- a joke?

07:50.790 --> 07:54.390
- yeah. Listen. Okay.

07:54.460 --> 07:55.430
What did the young shrimp say

07:55.500 --> 07:56.160
When his mom asked him

07:56.230 --> 07:56.960
Why he wouldn't share

07:57.030 --> 07:58.360
Any of his toys?

07:58.430 --> 07:59.200
- what?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.500
- sorry,

08:00.570 --> 08:07.410
I'm a little shellfish.

08:07.470 --> 08:08.740
Get it?

08:08.810 --> 08:09.510
'cause shrimp

08:09.580 --> 08:12.080
Are very self-centered.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.810
- I think the joke

08:13.880 --> 08:15.280
Is that shellfish sounds

08:15.350 --> 08:17.480
Like selfish.

08:17.550 --> 08:18.280
- oh, my God.

08:18.350 --> 08:24.020
That's even funnier.

08:24.090 --> 08:26.830
Okay, back to the script.

08:26.890 --> 08:27.760
- hey.

08:27.830 --> 08:28.760
What if our script's about a kid

08:28.830 --> 08:29.830
Who goes into a closet

08:29.900 --> 08:34.770
To look for something and--ulch.

08:34.830 --> 08:35.429
- what?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.470
- who was that?

08:36.539 --> 08:37.200
- Robbie's requesting

08:37.270 --> 08:40.370
To join our chat.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.240
- hey.

08:41.309 --> 08:42.039
- hi.

08:42.110 --> 08:42.770
- 'sup?

08:42.840 --> 08:43.780
- hey, Rob.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.780
- hey, Robbie.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.880
What did the young shrimp say

08:45.950 --> 08:46.780
When his mom asked--

08:46.850 --> 08:47.810
- I'm a little shellfish,

08:47.880 --> 08:50.450
You told me yesterday.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.520
- poo.

08:52.590 --> 08:53.080
- listen,

08:53.150 --> 08:54.450
I need your guys' help.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.960
- you need professional help.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.260
- I don't either!

08:59.330 --> 09:00.090
- Robbie...

09:00.160 --> 09:00.830
- we're trying to work

09:00.890 --> 09:01.430
On a script

09:01.490 --> 09:02.860
That's due in the morning.

09:02.930 --> 09:04.730
- this'll just take a second.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.430
- okay, what's your problem?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.100
- well, on Friday at school,

09:08.170 --> 09:09.170
I asked Rex if he wanted

09:09.240 --> 09:10.200
To see a movie with me

09:10.270 --> 09:11.570
On Sunday night.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.040
True or false?

09:13.110 --> 09:14.370
- you said, "how would you feel

09:14.440 --> 09:15.470
"about seein' a movie

09:15.540 --> 09:16.340
On Sunday night?"

09:16.410 --> 09:16.980
And I said,

09:17.040 --> 09:18.410
"sounds like a plan."

09:18.480 --> 09:19.280
- exactly.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.310
And now it's Sunday night

09:20.380 --> 09:23.150
And Rex says he has other plans.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.550
- which I do.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.120
- why would you go

09:26.190 --> 09:27.020
And make other plans

09:27.090 --> 09:27.850
When you said you'd see a movie

09:27.920 --> 09:28.550
With me?

09:28.620 --> 09:29.450
- you guys.

09:29.460 --> 09:30.190
- I never said

09:30.260 --> 09:31.520
I would see a movie with you.

09:31.590 --> 09:33.460
I said, "sounds like a plan."

09:33.530 --> 09:34.890
- what's the difference?

09:34.960 --> 09:35.460
- you never called me

09:35.530 --> 09:37.200
To confirm.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.100
- I'm gonna get a rootbeer.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.430
- Robbie, Rex, you guys

09:40.500 --> 09:42.070
Work this out yourselves.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.070
- bye, Robbie.

09:43.140 --> 09:43.900
- wait, no, don't kick us out

09:43.970 --> 09:45.000
Of the chat!

09:45.070 --> 09:48.310
No, don't!

09:48.370 --> 09:49.170
- all right,

09:49.240 --> 09:50.340
Back to our script.

09:50.410 --> 09:51.710
- hey, what if we write

09:51.780 --> 09:53.080
About a giraffe

09:53.150 --> 09:56.950
Who learns to love?

09:56.950 --> 09:58.120
- a giraffe?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.650
- that's not good.

09:59.720 --> 10:01.550
- no.

10:01.550 --> 10:02.520
- let's just stick with the kid

10:02.590 --> 10:03.660
In the closet.

10:03.660 --> 10:03.960
- right.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.360
So I was thinking,

10:05.420 --> 10:06.690
Maybe he comes home from school

10:06.760 --> 10:07.890
Looking for something,

10:07.960 --> 10:09.430
And he goes into his closet,

10:09.500 --> 10:10.630
And there's like a small,

10:10.700 --> 10:15.100
Secret door in the back of--cat.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.540
What are you doing?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.570
- I clicked on rainbow.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.940
Woooooooo.

10:22.010 --> 10:23.340
-ill you please stop that?

10:23.410 --> 10:25.910
- we gotta do this project.

10:25.980 --> 10:28.650
- sorry.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.380
- now where were we?

10:30.450 --> 10:31.180
- uh, the kid goes

10:31.250 --> 10:32.320
Into his closet.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.450
- right.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.320
And maybe it's not a normal kid.

10:35.390 --> 10:36.760
Maybe he's like created

10:36.820 --> 10:37.860
By scientists

10:37.920 --> 10:40.360
In a government lab or...

10:40.430 --> 10:41.660
- who's that?

10:41.730 --> 10:41.990
- jade.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.660
Let me see what she wants.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.930
- aww.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.830
- hey, look.

10:46.900 --> 10:47.670
We're doing this project

10:47.730 --> 10:48.730
That's due tomorrow morning,

10:48.800 --> 10:49.430
So...

10:49.500 --> 10:50.740
- where have you been?

10:50.740 --> 10:52.300
- home. Why?

10:52.370 --> 10:53.510
- I left you a voicemail

10:53.570 --> 10:55.340
And you haven't called me back.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.340
- I'm doing homework.

10:57.410 --> 10:57.940
- so you wanna break up

10:58.010 --> 10:59.380
With me.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.080
- wait. No. No.

11:01.150 --> 11:01.810
Why would you think

11:01.880 --> 11:02.550
That I want to break up

11:02.620 --> 11:03.480
With you...

11:03.550 --> 11:04.820
- why do you have that animal?

11:04.880 --> 11:06.020
- my neighbor's dog.

11:06.020 --> 11:08.490
- his neighbor the cheerleader.

11:08.550 --> 11:10.620
- cheerleader?

11:10.690 --> 11:13.120
- why? Why would you say that?

11:13.190 --> 11:14.290
- sorry.

11:14.360 --> 11:14.890
- you know

11:14.960 --> 11:17.530
What cheerleaders have?

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
Pep.

11:19.670 --> 11:20.530
- pep?

11:20.600 --> 11:22.600
- did she say pep?

11:22.600 --> 11:23.500
- why are you doing favors

11:23.570 --> 11:24.470
For a cheerleader,

11:24.540 --> 11:26.240
And what is she doing for you?

11:26.310 --> 11:27.110
- it's not what you think.

11:27.170 --> 11:27.810
She's just...

11:27.870 --> 11:29.510
- I'm coming over there.

11:29.580 --> 11:30.340
- no, no.

11:30.410 --> 11:32.140
You don't need to...

11:32.210 --> 11:33.280
- all right.

11:33.350 --> 11:35.450
So far we have nothing.

11:35.510 --> 11:36.410
So it'd be great if we could do

11:36.480 --> 11:38.050
A little writing together, okay?

11:38.120 --> 11:38.950
- look!

11:39.020 --> 11:43.590
I'm in a kaleidoscope.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.590
- oh, how does she do that?

11:45.660 --> 11:46.390
- you just click effects

11:46.460 --> 11:47.660
On the lower left.

11:47.730 --> 11:48.430
- this is not a time

11:48.490 --> 11:49.490
For effects.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.360
- wooooooooooo.

11:52.430 --> 11:54.370
- hey, look at me!

11:54.430 --> 11:55.070
You guys are giving me

11:55.130 --> 11:56.100
A headache.

11:56.170 --> 11:57.270
- andre...

11:57.340 --> 11:58.900
- ooh! I'm getting dizzy.

11:58.970 --> 12:01.540
Look at me, I'm spinning around.

12:01.610 --> 12:03.510
- what effect is that?

12:03.580 --> 12:05.680
- it's spinning clockwise.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.580
- why tell her that?!

12:07.650 --> 12:09.280
- whoa. Look at me.

12:09.350 --> 12:10.750
- we're not making progress.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.050
- here I go!

12:12.120 --> 12:13.590
- andre, I need you to focus

12:13.650 --> 12:14.990
And keep your eyes...

12:15.050 --> 12:16.020
- I'm spinning.

12:16.090 --> 12:18.260
I can't focus on anything.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.490
- it's like a space ship.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.190
- I'm princess rotation.

12:22.260 --> 12:22.890
- you guys.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.100
We have a project to work on.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.000
I'm not gonna sit here and watch

12:25.060 --> 12:27.030
You guys spin clockwise!

12:27.100 --> 12:28.270
- hey, you heard the lady.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.430
Ready?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.040
- counterclockwise!

12:31.100 --> 12:32.740
- oh. Reverse!

12:32.810 --> 12:34.710
We're in reverse now.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.110
- that's not what I meant.

12:36.180 --> 12:36.840
- look at me

12:36.910 --> 12:39.180
Going back in time.

12:39.250 --> 12:39.840
- when did I become

12:39.910 --> 12:41.350
The mature one?

12:41.410 --> 12:44.480
- I don't know. Quit it!

12:44.550 --> 12:45.380
- make me!

12:45.450 --> 12:46.850
- oh, I'm gonna make you, kid.

12:46.920 --> 12:51.760
- you guys.

12:51.820 --> 12:52.220
This is no time

12:52.290 --> 12:53.020
To fool around.

12:53.090 --> 12:53.660
- you cannot treat me

12:53.730 --> 12:54.290
Like that.

12:54.360 --> 12:54.760
Excuse me.

12:54.780 --> 12:57.280
Your son is being a brat.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:14.960 --> 13:15.760
- all right.

13:15.830 --> 13:20.900
So the little boy yells...

13:20.970 --> 13:22.130
Will you stop that?

13:22.200 --> 13:25.200
- what?!

13:25.270 --> 13:26.340
- stop dancing in your seat

13:26.410 --> 13:30.940
Like a weirdo!

13:31.010 --> 13:33.710
So the little boy yells what?

13:33.710 --> 13:34.710
- how about,

13:34.780 --> 13:37.220
"mom! There's evil in my closet!

13:37.280 --> 13:39.320
Eviiiilll!"

13:39.390 --> 13:40.850
- okay. Good.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.520
How do I spell eviiiilll?

13:43.520 --> 13:45.760
- use four is and three ls.

13:45.830 --> 13:49.460
- got it. Okay.

13:49.530 --> 13:51.160
Now, why don't we say

13:51.230 --> 13:52.360
The mom walks into the closet

13:52.430 --> 13:53.600
To find her son's face

13:53.670 --> 13:54.970
Being eaten by...

13:54.970 --> 14:00.170
- look! Now I'm a cherry pie.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.270
I'm pie girl!

14:02.340 --> 14:06.850
But don't bite off my nose.

14:06.850 --> 14:08.710
- cat! We have a 10-page script

14:08.780 --> 14:09.310
Due tomorrow morning

14:09.380 --> 14:10.480
And we're on page three,

14:10.550 --> 14:11.580
And you're not helping at all.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.250
Now will you please stop

14:12.320 --> 14:17.620
Acting like a child?!

14:17.690 --> 14:19.760
- there she goes.

14:19.830 --> 14:20.530
- look.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.430
I didn't mean to yell at you.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.130
Please don't cry.

14:23.200 --> 14:28.030
I was frustrated because--oh.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.170
- what happened?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.170
- I made cat cry

14:30.240 --> 14:31.340
And she signed off.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.370
- well, you have to learn

14:32.440 --> 14:33.240
To be more careful

14:33.310 --> 14:36.380
With people's feelings.

14:36.440 --> 14:37.580
- stop kicking my seat

14:37.640 --> 14:39.180
You worthless little nub!

14:39.250 --> 14:44.450
- shut up, old lady!

14:44.520 --> 14:45.820
- are you gonna let your kid

14:45.890 --> 14:48.190
Talk to me that way?!

14:48.250 --> 14:50.690
- I gotta take a wazz.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.790
- enjoy your wazz!

14:53.860 --> 14:55.190
- so where are we

14:55.260 --> 14:55.990
In the script?

14:56.060 --> 14:57.230
- still page three.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.100
The boy says, "mom!

14:58.160 --> 14:59.000
"there's evil in my closet!

14:59.070 --> 14:59.930
Eviiilll!"

15:00.000 --> 15:00.770
- right.

15:00.830 --> 15:01.370
- oh, yeah.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.500
- okay. So next,

15:02.570 --> 15:03.570
Why don't we say the closet

15:03.640 --> 15:04.800
Starts turning into, like,

15:04.870 --> 15:07.340
A fiery den of...

15:07.410 --> 15:09.010
- is that Robbie again?

15:09.080 --> 15:09.780
- yeah.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.210
He wants to re-join our chat.

15:11.280 --> 15:11.910
- no.

15:11.980 --> 15:12.740
- deny it.

15:12.810 --> 15:16.450

15:18.380 --> 15:19.250

15:19.320 --> 15:20.150
Where do you think I'm going?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.520
I gotta take a wazz.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.190
- the nub's dad

15:23.260 --> 15:24.720
Is in the bathroom.

15:24.790 --> 15:25.990
- I'm not going back there.

15:26.060 --> 15:26.730
I'm gonna go pee

15:26.790 --> 15:28.260
In the first class lavatory.

15:28.330 --> 15:29.290
- you're not allowed to.

15:29.360 --> 15:31.960
- yeah, yeah. Move.

15:32.030 --> 15:32.630

15:34.130 --> 15:36.900

15:36.970 --> 15:41.740

15:44.680 --> 15:47.310
- yeah. I know.

15:47.380 --> 15:51.480

15:51.550 --> 15:52.380

15:52.450 --> 15:53.790
My sister hot?

15:53.850 --> 16:02.330

16:02.400 --> 16:03.560

16:03.630 --> 16:04.960
Boyfriend there?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.800

16:06.870 --> 16:07.270
[knocking]

16:07.330 --> 16:08.500
- what's that noise?

16:08.570 --> 16:10.200

16:13.310 --> 16:15.870
On a project!

16:15.940 --> 16:18.180
- I need to talk to you.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.780
- sorry. Door's locked.

16:19.850 --> 16:22.110
[door being forcefully opened]

16:22.180 --> 16:24.120
Now it's not locked.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.120
- she has a key?

16:25.180 --> 16:28.220
- no, she has a foot.

16:28.290 --> 16:29.590
- what is going on?

16:29.660 --> 16:31.820
- you just kicked my door open.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.260
- put the dog down and tell me

16:33.330 --> 16:34.230
About this cheerleader chick

16:34.290 --> 16:35.160
Who lives next door.

16:35.230 --> 16:35.890
- I'm not gonna put

16:35.960 --> 16:36.660
The dog down.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.130
- oh, aren't you?

16:38.200 --> 16:38.930
- if you wanna meet

16:39.000 --> 16:39.430
The cheerleader,

16:39.500 --> 16:40.130
She'll be back any minute

16:40.200 --> 16:41.230
To pick up her dog.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.000
- then I'll wait for her.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.500
- whatever you want.

16:45.570 --> 16:46.810
- okay, can we get back

16:46.870 --> 16:47.970
To writing the script now?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.670
- yeah, let's get this done.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.280
- okay. Boy's in the closet.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.380
Face being eaten.

16:52.450 --> 16:54.980
Mom walks in and...

16:55.050 --> 16:56.820
- another video chat request?

16:56.880 --> 16:58.250
- who is it now?

16:58.320 --> 16:59.280
- someone named

16:59.350 --> 17:01.290
Lilóstephanie21.

17:01.350 --> 17:02.290
- who's she?

17:02.360 --> 17:05.589
- I don't know. Let me see.

17:05.660 --> 17:07.790

17:07.859 --> 17:08.859
- Robbie!

17:08.930 --> 17:09.630
- dude!

17:09.700 --> 17:11.000
- oh, come on.

17:11.060 --> 17:11.630
- you created

17:11.700 --> 17:12.900
A fake screen name?

17:12.970 --> 17:15.170
- well, you denied my real one.

17:15.230 --> 17:17.240
- but why lilóstephanie21?

17:17.300 --> 17:18.339
- 'cause lilóstephanie1

17:18.400 --> 17:21.710
Through 20 were taken! What?

17:21.770 --> 17:22.540
- you couldn't have picked

17:22.609 --> 17:23.440
A boy's name?

17:23.510 --> 17:26.140
- says a lot, doesn't it?

17:26.210 --> 17:27.750
- look, don't you guys agree

17:27.810 --> 17:28.580
That if a person says

17:28.650 --> 17:29.550
He'll see a movie with you

17:29.620 --> 17:30.480
On Sunday night,

17:30.550 --> 17:31.950
He should honor that commitment

17:32.020 --> 17:34.820
And not just leave me hanging.

17:34.890 --> 17:36.020
- what happened to Robbie?

17:36.090 --> 17:38.190
- my finger.

17:38.260 --> 17:39.120
- ah.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.290
- all passengers, please...

17:40.360 --> 17:42.530
- move, move, move.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.400
- ah!

17:43.460 --> 17:45.860
- it's back!

17:45.930 --> 17:46.830
- will you stop wiggling

17:46.900 --> 17:49.000
Your butt in my friends' faces?

17:49.070 --> 17:49.630
- guess who I just met

17:49.700 --> 17:50.800
In first class!

17:50.870 --> 17:51.600
- who?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.040
- Perez Hilton!

17:53.110 --> 17:53.840
- shut up.

17:53.910 --> 17:55.870
- I swear! Row one seat b!

17:55.940 --> 17:57.380
- oh, man, please tell me

17:57.440 --> 17:58.580
You didn't bother Perez Hilton.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.750
- I had to!

18:00.810 --> 18:02.050
- trina.

18:02.110 --> 18:02.680
- do you realize

18:02.750 --> 18:04.220
How powerfule is in Hollywood?

18:04.280 --> 18:07.850
He can make me famous overnight!

18:07.920 --> 18:09.250
- so you talked to him?

18:09.320 --> 18:09.890
- I tried to,

18:09.960 --> 18:10.390
But then he called

18:10.460 --> 18:11.120
The flight attendant

18:11.190 --> 18:12.020
Who called the sky marshal

18:12.090 --> 18:12.920
And then they escorted me

18:12.990 --> 18:15.290
Out of first class.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.360
- so why are you all smiley?

18:17.430 --> 18:21.500
- I got his camera!

18:21.570 --> 18:22.730
- why?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.140
- 'cause tomorrow

18:24.200 --> 18:24.840
I'll email him,

18:24.900 --> 18:26.070
Say I found his camera,

18:26.140 --> 18:26.840
And he'll be so grateful

18:26.910 --> 18:27.470
When I give it back

18:27.540 --> 18:28.240
That he'll write about me

18:28.310 --> 18:30.380
In his blog and I'll be famous!

18:30.440 --> 18:31.080
- what ever happened

18:31.140 --> 18:31.780
To getting famous

18:31.840 --> 18:33.550
By having some talent?

18:33.610 --> 18:35.080
- talent has nothing to do

18:35.150 --> 18:39.080
With being famous.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.720
- oh, now who?

18:40.790 --> 18:41.490
- somebody wants

18:41.550 --> 18:42.990
To join our chat.

18:43.060 --> 18:44.560
- it's probably Robbie again.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.360
- ugh.

18:45.420 --> 18:46.890
- what's the screen name?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.430

18:49.500 --> 18:52.760

18:52.830 --> 18:54.870
- hey guys.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.800
I see you're video chatting.

18:56.870 --> 18:57.570
- what you need?

18:57.640 --> 18:59.670
'cause we're really kinda busy.

18:59.740 --> 19:01.240
- are you on a plane?

19:01.310 --> 19:02.870
- yeah, I'm on a plane.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.640
- and they have wi-fi?

19:04.710 --> 19:05.380
- no, sinjin.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.110
I have the world's longest

19:06.180 --> 19:06.910
Internet cable

19:06.980 --> 19:08.880
Hanging out the window.

19:08.950 --> 19:09.920
- nuh-uh.

19:09.980 --> 19:13.990
Airplane windows don't open.

19:14.050 --> 19:19.190
- hey, wait a minute. Sinjin?

19:19.260 --> 19:21.160
- hi, jade.

19:21.230 --> 19:26.100
- where did you get that lamp?

19:26.170 --> 19:28.470
-- at the lamp store.

19:28.530 --> 19:29.470
- it looks exactly like

19:29.540 --> 19:30.240
The lamp I have

19:30.300 --> 19:32.270
In my den at home.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.910
- oh. Weird.

19:34.970 --> 19:41.050
- are you in my house?!

19:41.110 --> 19:43.650
Take your computer with you!

19:43.720 --> 19:45.650
- please don't tell my mother.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.480
- all right,

19:46.550 --> 19:47.190
We're not accepting

19:47.250 --> 19:48.750
Any more chat requests, okay?

19:48.820 --> 19:49.850
- good.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.590
- agreed.

19:50.660 --> 19:51.420
- andre!

19:51.490 --> 19:53.290
Stop talking to yourself!

19:53.360 --> 19:53.960
- grandma,

19:54.030 --> 19:54.860
I'm not talking to myself.

19:54.930 --> 19:56.190
I'm talking to tori and Beck.

19:56.260 --> 19:57.500
- that's a lie!

19:57.560 --> 19:59.360
They're not here!

19:59.430 --> 20:00.230
- I know that.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.000
I'm talking to them online. See?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.000
- hi, Mrs. Harris.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.200
- how you doing?

20:06.270 --> 20:07.510
- I don't understand this!

20:07.570 --> 20:08.440
- grandma.

20:08.510 --> 20:10.810
- ah! Grandma!

20:10.880 --> 20:12.380
- aw, grandma!

20:12.450 --> 20:14.280
Just go sit down on your couch!

20:14.350 --> 20:16.450
- it's just me, Mrs. Harris.

20:16.520 --> 20:21.250
- leave me alone!

20:21.320 --> 20:22.190
- guess that just leaves

20:22.250 --> 20:23.820
You and me.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.190
- and me.

20:26.260 --> 20:27.160
- let's just get an f

20:27.230 --> 20:28.230
And be done with this.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.290
- oh, come on. We can finish

20:29.360 --> 20:30.760
This script ourselves.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.160
- you really want to?

20:32.230 --> 20:32.700
- sure.

20:32.770 --> 20:33.400
Why don't we just try to--

20:33.470 --> 20:34.270
[knock on door]

20:34.330 --> 20:35.970
- oh. Now what?

20:36.040 --> 20:36.800

20:36.870 --> 20:38.200

20:39.340 --> 20:44.440

20:49.680 --> 20:50.720

20:50.780 --> 20:52.880
My next door neighbor, Allie.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.020
Allie, this is my girlfriend,

20:54.090 --> 20:55.350
Jade.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.120
- nice to meet you.

20:57.190 --> 21:00.630
- hello, Allie.

21:00.690 --> 21:01.430
- thanks for taking care

21:01.490 --> 21:02.490
Of sparkles.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.500
- any time, kiddo.

21:06.570 --> 21:09.230
- your girlfriend's pretty.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.870
- I know.

21:11.940 --> 21:13.140
- bye.

21:13.210 --> 21:21.150
- see you.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.650
- wow, jade, looks like

21:22.720 --> 21:25.620
You got some competition there.

21:25.680 --> 21:27.050
- you gonna say you're sorry?

21:27.120 --> 21:27.690
- you didn't tell me

21:27.750 --> 21:29.190
She was nine.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.160
- you didn't give me a chance.

21:30.220 --> 21:30.820
- oh, don't try

21:30.890 --> 21:31.760
To turn this around on me!

21:31.820 --> 21:32.620
- hey. Beck.

21:32.690 --> 21:33.730
- you love making me jealous.

21:33.790 --> 21:34.560
You could've said she's nine.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.760
I wouldn't have gotten

21:35.830 --> 21:36.930
Upset with you.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.300
- listen.

21:37.360 --> 21:37.930
Can you guys fight later?

21:38.000 --> 21:38.560
- stay out of this, tori!

21:38.630 --> 21:39.400
- but I just need Beck

21:39.470 --> 21:41.630
To help me write--

21:41.700 --> 21:43.000
- oh.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.200
- now what are you gonna do?

21:45.270 --> 21:46.840
- I am gonna finish writing

21:46.910 --> 21:48.370
This script myself.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.210
We have 62 minutes

21:50.280 --> 21:51.410
Until we land, and I'm sure

21:51.480 --> 21:53.750
If I type really fast,

21:53.810 --> 21:55.110
I can get this done--

21:55.180 --> 21:56.350
- you!

21:56.420 --> 21:58.580
- Perez!

21:58.650 --> 21:59.380
- oh, my God.

21:59.450 --> 22:02.550
You're Perez Hilton!

22:02.620 --> 22:04.760
- you took my camera!

22:04.820 --> 22:06.220
- no, no I didn't!

22:06.290 --> 22:07.330
- yes, you did.

22:07.390 --> 22:10.300
It's in your hand!

22:10.360 --> 22:11.130
- I'll give it back

22:11.200 --> 22:11.930
If you write about me!

22:12.000 --> 22:12.930
- no! It doesn't work that way!

22:13.000 --> 22:13.970
Give me my camera!

22:14.030 --> 22:14.770
- oh, come on!

22:14.830 --> 22:15.500
- trina!

22:15.570 --> 22:16.300
- you don't understand.

22:16.370 --> 22:17.200
- give me my camera!

22:17.270 --> 22:17.900
- this is a big deal to me.

22:17.970 --> 22:18.570
This is like something

22:18.640 --> 22:20.070
I've waited for my whole life.

22:20.140 --> 22:20.540
No, no, no!

22:20.610 --> 22:21.810
- oh, my God!

22:21.870 --> 22:23.510
Perez Hilton is on my lap!

22:23.580 --> 22:29.980
Perez Hilton is on my lap!

22:30.050 --> 22:30.520
- can you invite me
