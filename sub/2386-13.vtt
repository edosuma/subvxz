00:00.354 --> 00:02.934
<i>Kids, on New Year's Day 2012,</i>

00:02.936 --> 00:04.936
<i>Uncle Marshall took a trip</i>
<i>to Minnesota</i>

00:04.938 --> 00:06.921
<i>to see someone he truly missed.</i>

00:11.727 --> 00:14.029
Hey, Pop.

00:14.031 --> 00:16.247
I can't believe
it's been a year.

00:16.248 --> 00:19.233
I think the most appropriate way

00:19.235 --> 00:22.570
to honor your memory today...

00:22.572 --> 00:23.872
is to get blasted

00:23.874 --> 00:25.840
and watch the Vikings
make the Bears

00:25.842 --> 00:26.958
their furry little bitches.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.960
- Go, Vikes!
- Shh.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.679
Sorry for your loss.

00:30.681 --> 00:33.181
Which is what
we'll be saying to the Bears

00:33.183 --> 00:34.599
in about three hours,
right, Pop?

00:34.601 --> 00:37.385
<i>Kids, tailgating</i>
<i>at the Vikings-Bears game</i>

00:37.387 --> 00:40.388
<i>was a tradition</i>
<i>for Uncle Marshall and his dad.</i>

00:40.390 --> 00:41.806
That's how
the government

00:41.808 --> 00:44.425
covered up the UFO crash
in Roswell:

00:44.427 --> 00:47.946
by canning the sliced up
alien carcasses

00:47.948 --> 00:54.919
and calling it Spam.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.154
Wow.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.540
Is there anything
you don't know, Dad?

00:58.542 --> 00:59.774
No.

00:59.776 --> 01:01.609
I know most stuff.

01:01.611 --> 01:03.995
And in your honor...

01:03.997 --> 01:07.966
three decades of pork fat,
lighter fluid and Bengay.

01:09.302 --> 01:11.669
Dear God, that's the stuff.

01:11.671 --> 01:14.339
So much to catch you up on.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.475
So, last night
was New Year's Eve.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.460
That's a crazy story.

01:19.462 --> 01:21.880
<i>So you haven't told your dad</i>
<i>that you're pregnant yet?</i>

01:21.882 --> 01:24.465
No. But why should I?

01:24.467 --> 01:26.300
My dad has never
been there for me.

01:26.302 --> 01:28.970
This is just another chance
for him to let me down.

01:28.972 --> 01:31.906
Lily, you have to tell him.

01:31.908 --> 01:34.993
He's at some board game
convention in Chicago.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.579
He's your dad.

01:37.581 --> 01:39.247
I don't see why people
aren't getting this.

01:39.249 --> 01:40.532
Shoplifter
does not promote crime.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.334
It celebrates it.

01:43.336 --> 01:44.986
Excuse me.

01:44.988 --> 01:46.320
Yeah.

01:46.322 --> 01:47.872
Hey, Dad.

01:47.874 --> 01:51.509
I'm, uh, calling with
some pretty big news.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.344
I'm pregnant.

01:53.346 --> 01:55.263
Great. Thanks.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.616
<i>wasn't off</i>
<i>to a great start, either.</i>

02:14.618 --> 02:16.151
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. It's 50 bucks,

02:16.153 --> 02:17.351
and the line
starts out there.

02:17.353 --> 02:19.353
Uh, we're regulars.
Oh, in that case,

02:19.355 --> 02:21.206
the line starts out there,
and it's 50 bucks.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.024
You got a problem
with that?

02:23.026 --> 02:25.894
<i>Kids, here's why we didn't have</i>
<i>a problem with that.</i>

02:27.379 --> 02:30.448
<i>And he was even scarier</i>
<i>without the toupee.</i>

02:30.450 --> 02:31.966
No problem.
It's a little drafty.

02:31.968 --> 02:33.751
We'll get you
a nice hot cocoa.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.506
Check it out.

02:38.508 --> 02:40.809
Sandy Rivers'
New Year's Eve show.

02:40.811 --> 02:43.094
Thank God
I don't have to produce

02:43.096 --> 02:44.262
this frozen pile
of poo.

02:44.264 --> 02:45.513
How'd you dodge
that bullet?

02:45.515 --> 02:48.733
Well, maybe Tina,
the producer, he, uh, picked,

02:48.735 --> 02:50.351
is more talented
than I am...

02:50.353 --> 02:53.188
at lying down while Sandy
does his business on her.

02:53.190 --> 02:55.356
Does it bother you
that this pervert's

02:55.358 --> 02:56.858
on the air,
and you're not anymore?

02:56.860 --> 02:58.193
Do you miss it?

02:59.529 --> 03:02.580
What? Why would...
why would I miss it?

03:02.582 --> 03:04.749
No. I would rather

03:04.751 --> 03:07.919
be warm and cozy
here in denial-- my apartment.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.420
Robin,
I'm no therapist--

03:09.422 --> 03:11.372
wait, yes, I am--

03:11.374 --> 03:14.075
but I've got a New Year's
resolution for you.

03:14.077 --> 03:15.409
Get back on camera.

03:15.411 --> 03:18.763
Mine was going to be "make
a sex tape," so... two birds.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.217
Hold that thought.

03:22.219 --> 03:23.935
Hello?

03:23.937 --> 03:25.253
Sandy?

03:25.255 --> 03:26.604
Tina quit.

03:26.606 --> 03:29.023
The woman I love just quit.

03:29.025 --> 03:31.142
Love?
She's my everything, Robin.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.729
My sun, my stars, my oxygen.

03:34.731 --> 03:37.482
Plus, she likes it
fast and dirty,

03:37.484 --> 03:39.617
and that's how Sandy rides.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.536
I need you here ASAP.

03:41.538 --> 03:42.987
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

03:42.989 --> 03:44.405
Marcus?

03:44.407 --> 03:45.790
What the heck
are you doing here?

03:45.792 --> 03:47.742
What the heck are you
doing here?

03:47.744 --> 03:51.045
I wanted to see Dad today--
in private.

03:51.047 --> 03:52.780
Well, I had the same idea,

03:52.782 --> 03:55.884
and I drove all the way
from Mom's, so get lost.

03:55.886 --> 03:58.303
I flew here, so you get lost.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.505
Um, I'm trying to have
a poignant moment

04:00.507 --> 04:03.508
with our departed father,
turd face.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.310
Well, I'm trying
to feel Dad's spirit

04:05.312 --> 04:07.896
flow through my soul,
butt breath.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.480
I'm reaching out to the beyond

04:09.482 --> 04:12.300
to touch Dad's inner light,
ass clown.

04:12.302 --> 04:15.570
I hear Dad's voice
like an ethereal song

04:15.572 --> 04:18.906
guiding me toward salvation,
douche nozzle.

04:19.825 --> 04:21.858
- Dibs on Dad.
- Dibs on Dad times infinity.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.161
Oh!
Ooh.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.079
I'll just pretend
like you're not here.

04:26.448 --> 04:27.665
What?

04:27.667 --> 04:29.684
Dad, do you hear something?

04:29.686 --> 04:33.705
Perhaps the high-pitched whine
of someone who wet their bed

04:33.707 --> 04:35.340
until they were 11!

04:35.342 --> 04:36.541
Ten.

04:37.593 --> 04:41.679
Anyway, Dad, since it's just
the two of us...

04:43.165 --> 04:45.300
Lily and I
were going to spend New Year's

04:45.302 --> 04:46.684
unpacking the baby room.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.887
Um, sweetie, why
is this book in here?

04:49.889 --> 04:51.606
That's <i>Enigmas of The Mystical.</i>

04:51.608 --> 04:52.690
It's all about
mysterious

04:52.692 --> 04:54.192
and unexplained phenomena.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.978
Don't you remember the TV
commercials from the '80s?

04:56.980 --> 04:59.230
<i>June 17th, 1983.</i>

04:59.232 --> 05:00.898
<i>Tempe, Arizona.</i>

05:00.900 --> 05:03.101
<i>A woman makes</i>
<i>a chicken salad sandwich.</i>

05:03.103 --> 05:05.019
<i>Chicken salad sandwich.</i>

05:05.021 --> 05:06.904
<i>Halfway across the country</i>
<i>in Michigan,</i>

05:06.906 --> 05:08.623
<i>her daughter</i>
<i>is compelled to make</i>

05:08.625 --> 05:11.525
<i>almost exactly</i>
<i>the same sandwich.</i>

05:11.527 --> 05:12.910
<i>Tuna salad.</i>

05:12.912 --> 05:14.512
<i>Coincidence?</i>

05:14.514 --> 05:17.165
<i>Or an enigma of the mystical!</i>

05:18.885 --> 05:22.503
Yeah, those enigmas
always seemed a bit thin to me.

05:22.505 --> 05:25.473
Thin?
Lily, this is 200 pages

05:25.475 --> 05:29.043
of detailed accounts
about Bigfoot, ghosts,

05:29.045 --> 05:31.429
aliens abducting people from
their beds and probing them.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.147
I'm going to read it
to Baby Eriksen

05:33.149 --> 05:34.382
at night-night.

05:34.384 --> 05:36.351
You really want
to read our kid

05:36.353 --> 05:37.902
bedtime stories about monsters?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.737
First of all,
I wouldn't use the "M" word.

05:39.739 --> 05:40.989
Only they can call
themselves that.

05:40.991 --> 05:42.390
And secondly,
are you really saying

05:42.392 --> 05:44.492
you don't want to raise
our child as a believer?

05:44.494 --> 05:46.444
I don't want
to brainwash our child

05:46.446 --> 05:48.496
to believe in something
with no proof.

05:48.498 --> 05:50.231
It's not about proof;
it's about faith.

05:50.233 --> 05:52.500
Faith is what gives life
shape and meaning.

05:52.502 --> 05:54.419
I mean, if there aren't yetis
or leprechauns,

05:54.421 --> 05:56.504
what's the point of even
getting up in the morning?

05:56.506 --> 05:57.789
I don't know.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.508
Wife, unborn child,
drop a deuce?

06:00.510 --> 06:03.711
Lily, don't you think
it's a bit narcissistic

06:03.713 --> 06:07.048
not to allow for something
bigger than us out there?

06:07.050 --> 06:09.467
Something whose
beauty and power

06:09.469 --> 06:11.686
and majesty humbles us?

06:11.688 --> 06:13.521
God?
Werewolves.

06:16.359 --> 06:19.060
So, as the countdown
to 212 continues,

06:19.062 --> 06:20.812
a quick warning, America:

06:20.814 --> 06:23.815
Tina Henderson
is a soulless bitch

06:23.817 --> 06:26.784
who will stomp on your heart.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.203
I need you back, Tina.

06:29.205 --> 06:31.122
I love you.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.825
Well, if that's as bad
as it gets, we might be okay.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.943
Bathroom break.

06:38.415 --> 06:39.714
Oh, good.

06:39.716 --> 06:41.916
It's on the Jumbotron.

06:41.918 --> 06:43.384
Oh, finally.

06:43.386 --> 06:44.618
Yeah, that'll be
100 bucks each.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.471
What? You said 50.

06:46.473 --> 06:48.639
That was before
the place got crowded.

06:48.641 --> 06:49.790
Okay? It's
New Year's Eve.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.092
People get rowdy
and break stuff.

06:51.094 --> 06:52.260
The cover protects us.

06:52.262 --> 06:54.729
Plus, you get these
festive hats.

06:54.731 --> 06:56.797
For an additional
15 bucks.

06:56.799 --> 06:58.683
They're wet.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.268
Dry ones are 20.

07:00.270 --> 07:01.819
That's it.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.488
Don't bother,
everybody.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.906
MacLaren's is a rip-off!

07:04.908 --> 07:06.157
You'd all be better off

07:06.159 --> 07:08.476
coming upstairs
to my place for a beer.

07:08.478 --> 07:10.745
Hey, dude. You serious?

07:11.646 --> 07:15.333
Ted, do you remember
a couple yea ago,

07:15.335 --> 07:18.652
we had the best idea
of a time?

07:18.654 --> 07:20.004
We should buy a bar.

07:20.006 --> 07:22.507
Of course! We could buy a bar!

07:22.509 --> 07:24.292
The name of
our bar?

07:24.294 --> 07:26.794
Puzzles.

07:26.796 --> 07:29.163
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

07:29.165 --> 07:31.682
That's the puzzle.

07:31.684 --> 07:34.502
A bar where no
one's overcharged,

07:34.504 --> 07:37.605
where everyone feels
valued and respected.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.190
A bar...

07:39.192 --> 07:42.193
where we get chicks drunk
and bang them.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.145
We're opening
Puzzles tonight.

07:44.147 --> 07:47.365
Of course we're opening
Puzzles tonight!

07:47.367 --> 07:50.851
Aren't you going to ask us
why it's called Puzzles?

07:50.853 --> 07:52.453
Nope.

07:52.455 --> 07:54.322
Okay.

07:54.324 --> 07:57.792
Okay, we're back
live in 30 seconds.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.160
I don't know.

07:59.162 --> 08:02.130
Uht's see if he's
still wearing his mic.

08:02.132 --> 08:04.582
Taxi, take me to Tina's house.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.250
50 West 67th.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.802
Sir, this is a falafel stand,

08:07.804 --> 08:09.220
and you're sitting
in the hummu

08:10.557 --> 08:11.923
Okay.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.392
Run the montage of people who
died this year until I get back.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.593
And add Sandy,

08:15.595 --> 08:17.812
because when I find him,
I'm going to kill him.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.138
- Anyway, Dad...
- Stop hogging Dad already.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.408
- I've got stuff to tell him, too.
- Like what?

08:31.410 --> 08:33.510
You're still living with Mom,
and you have no job.

08:34.345 --> 08:35.645
Go ahead.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.681
So, anyway...

08:38.683 --> 08:41.400
July 8, 19.

08:41.403 --> 08:42.568
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

08:42.571 --> 08:45.405
A hunter spots
a hairy form in the fore.

08:45.407 --> 08:46.690
Bigfoot.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.858
His story
is dismissed

08:47.860 --> 08:50.410
because, to be honest,
he'd been drinking

08:50.412 --> 08:52.979
and had a history
of mental problems.

08:52.981 --> 08:54.581
But was it a hoax?

08:54.583 --> 08:56.533
Or was it an enigma of the...

08:56.535 --> 08:59.035
It was an idiot
in a gorilla suit.

08:59.037 --> 09:00.987
Enigma.
Gorilla suit.

09:00.989 --> 09:04.174
Enigma!
Gorilla suit!

09:04.176 --> 09:05.825
Marshall? Marcus?

09:05.827 --> 09:07.928
What are you guys doing he?

09:07.930 --> 09:09.930
Having a private
moment with Dad.

09:09.932 --> 09:13.016
No, I'm having
a private moment with Dad.

09:13.018 --> 09:16.269
No, I'm having
a private moment with Dad.

09:16.271 --> 09:17.854
Touchdown, Vikings!

09:17.856 --> 09:19.672
Boom! Yeah!

09:25.797 --> 09:27.164
Anyway, Dad,

09:27.166 --> 09:30.117
since it's still
just the two of us,

09:30.119 --> 09:32.685
I'll go on.

09:35.540 --> 09:39.409
I've always envisioned Puzzles
as a literary salon,

09:39.411 --> 09:41.545
where Gotham's intelligentsia
hold court

09:41.547 --> 09:43.880
on art, philosophy
and literature.

09:43.882 --> 09:45.382
Great.

09:45.384 --> 09:48.418
And while you're distracting
the nerds and fatties,

09:48.420 --> 09:50.703
I'll be in the VIP room
getting it in.

09:50.705 --> 09:52.589
Uh, yeah, dude,
I don't know

09:52.591 --> 09:55.258
where you got a velvet rope,
but you can't

09:55.260 --> 09:57.394
use my room
for anonymous sex.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.346
I'm kind of a neat freak
that way.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.214
Hey, guys, I have an idea
for Puzzles.

10:01.216 --> 10:07.571
What if... What?

10:07.573 --> 10:09.489
Oh. Okay. I understand.

10:09.491 --> 10:10.890
But he we like
your energy.

10:10.892 --> 10:12.637
How would you like
to be our star bartender.

10:13.412 --> 10:14.894
I've always wanted
to be a bartender.

10:14.896 --> 10:16.196
It's just like
being a therapist.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.843
You listen to people's problems,
pretend to care,

10:17.868 --> 10:19.068
but you can drink openly,

10:19.168 --> 10:21.501
instead of having to hide
your booze in a coffee mug.

10:21.503 --> 10:22.836
Great. Oh,
check it out.

10:22.838 --> 10:25.422
We worked out
a theme song for Puzzles.

10:25.424 --> 10:26.923
While I was carrying
100-pound kegs

10:26.925 --> 10:28.925

burying my aunt, so...

11:21.597 --> 11:23.897

11:28.326 --> 11:29.487
Oh.

11:29.488 --> 11:31.821
It's just that I used to goto Vikes's

11:31.823 --> 11:34.574
with my aunt;
may she rest in peace.

11:40.081 --> 11:42.082
Anyway, so back
to my story.

11:43.618 --> 11:46.336
She also loved burgers.

11:50.841 --> 11:54.594
So now,
back to my story.

11:54.596 --> 11:56.546
Aunt Laura sure loved
a toasted bun.

12:02.219 --> 12:04.387
Tina, please tell me
Sandy's here.

12:04.389 --> 12:06.640
Don't worry, he's here.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.892
And we're back...
together!

12:08.894 --> 12:11.227
He told me he loves me,
he's sorry,

12:11.229 --> 12:13.396
and I'm the only girl for him.

12:14.515 --> 12:16.866
You know, since we'll here,

12:16.868 --> 12:19.069
and we're all horny...

12:20.788 --> 12:23.189
I don't know
what went wrong.

12:23.191 --> 12:24.941
Well, proposing the
three-way was bad,

12:24.943 --> 12:26.376
starting without us
was worse,

12:26.378 --> 12:28.945
finishing in the hallway was
the nail in the coffin.

12:28.947 --> 12:30.297
No! Stop drinking!

12:30.299 --> 12:32.582
I gotta get you
back on air!

12:32.584 --> 12:34.200
But I'm single and
ready to mingle!

12:34.202 --> 12:36.419
Hello, there.

12:36.421 --> 12:40.173
Oh, the Twitter-verse
blowing up about

12:40.175 --> 12:42.258
a new apartment-themed bar
called Puzzles.

12:42.260 --> 12:43.560
Why is it called
Puzzles?

12:43.562 --> 12:45.312
That's the puzzle!

12:45.314 --> 12:48.014
Anyway, this VIP room
has a maximum occupancy

12:48.016 --> 12:50.934
of two people including me,
so eeny...

12:50.936 --> 12:53.820
and the rest
of you may go.

12:54.772 --> 12:57.907
It's funny,
but it seems each time

12:57.909 --> 13:01.027
I read James Joyce's <i>Ulysses,</i>

13:01.029 --> 13:03.396
it's a different book,

13:03.398 --> 13:06.533
begging the question:
Has the book changed...

13:06.535 --> 13:08.952
or have I?

13:12.040 --> 13:14.741
Okay, people are getting rowdy
and drunk and breaking things.

13:14.743 --> 13:16.909
I know this goes against
the Puzzles mission statement

13:16.911 --> 13:19.462
you made me memorize, but we
gotta raise our drink prices.

13:19.464 --> 13:22.182
All right, just a little bit
so no one will notice.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.221
Boo!

All right, you know what,
you guys?

14:11.565 --> 14:12.606
No. No, no, no, no, no,
you said double

14:12.607 --> 14:14.023
what MacLaren's
was paying me.

14:14.802 --> 14:17.136
And why isn't anyone wearing
the hats I brought up?!

14:20.257 --> 14:22.442
"November 14th...

14:22.444 --> 14:23.410
"1982.

14:23.412 --> 14:26.780
"Everglades National Park,
Florida.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.649
"Five mysterious lights dance
in the night sky.

14:29.651 --> 14:32.285
"A ray shoots down,
lifting the park ranger,

14:32.287 --> 14:35.872
"who, to be fair, was going
through a bad divorce

14:35.874 --> 14:40.126
and had a habit of lying
to get attention."

14:40.128 --> 14:42.045
I hate this job, Sandy!

14:42.047 --> 14:44.264
I went into journalism
to make a difference,

14:44.266 --> 14:46.800
but you have made
that impossible.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.718
You know, to be honest,
it hasn't been

14:48.720 --> 14:50.687
an easy couple months for me.
I've made mistakes.

14:50.689 --> 14:53.106
I've felt alone.
I had to let go of dreams

14:53.108 --> 14:54.724
I didn't even know I had.

14:54.726 --> 14:56.943
So here's the deal:

14:56.945 --> 14:58.344
You're gonna get
back on air

14:58.346 --> 14:59.979
and count us
into a better year,

14:59.981 --> 15:04.567
because I just can't do
2011 anymore. You with me?

15:04.569 --> 15:06.986
He's not with me, is he?

15:13.305 --> 15:15.423
Anyway, Dad, where was I?

15:16.084 --> 15:17.368
You know what?
Fine, get out of here!

15:17.370 --> 15:19.620
We don't need ya!

15:21.456 --> 15:24.425
And why doesn't anybody
like these hats?

15:24.427 --> 15:28.429
I made these hats.

15:28.431 --> 15:30.097
It's because
they' wet, Doug.

15:30.099 --> 15:32.716
Why are they all wet?!

15:32.718 --> 15:34.835
Were those our last customers?

15:34.837 --> 15:36.854
Let me go check
the bathroom.

15:41.277 --> 15:43.527
You must be
from the escort service.

15:45.013 --> 15:50.734
The scenario is high school
wrestling match.

15:54.239 --> 15:55.188
Hello?

15:55.190 --> 15:57.791
So get this:
I lost Sandy Rivers.

15:57.793 --> 15:59.793
Funny you should mention that.

15:59.795 --> 16:00.861
It's almost midnight!

16:00.863 --> 16:02.880
What am I gonna do,
go on the air myself?

16:02.882 --> 16:06.050
Listen... Wait. Yeah, do that!

16:06.052 --> 16:07.718
No, I-I can't actually.

16:07.720 --> 16:10.554
Yes, you can. It's what you
really want and you deserve it.

16:10.556 --> 16:12.556
Kevin, that's not how it works.

16:12.558 --> 16:13.974
Sounds like that's
your only choice.

16:13.976 --> 16:16.060
New York's a big city.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.228
Sandy Rivers
could be anywhere.

16:19.514 --> 16:22.416
And... wrestle!

16:23.985 --> 16:25.569
Hey.

16:25.571 --> 16:28.388
I'm sorry, baby.

16:28.390 --> 16:30.074
I just...
I want our kid

16:30.076 --> 16:32.409
to believe that the
universe is magical.

16:32.411 --> 16:34.445
You know, like
my dad taught me.

16:34.447 --> 16:36.363
You know what
my dad taught me?

16:36.365 --> 16:38.615
Nothing...
'cause he was never there.

16:40.835 --> 16:44.872
"June 22nd, 1996,
Brooklyn, New York.

16:44.874 --> 16:48.742
"A man misses his daughter's
high school graduation.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.961
"Later, she discovers
her babysitting money

16:50.963 --> 16:52.963
"has been spent on
a board game called

16:52.965 --> 16:55.966
Who Stole The
Babysitting Money?"

16:55.968 --> 16:58.052
He never saw
the irony in that.

16:58.054 --> 17:01.555
"December 31st, 2011.

17:01.557 --> 17:05.559
"A woman calls her father
to tell him she's pregnant.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.645
says, 'Great. Thanks,'
and hangs up on her."

17:08.646 --> 17:12.098
And after pushing
her to call him,

17:12.101 --> 17:16.619
a Big Foot is discovered
in her husband's mouth.

17:17.739 --> 17:19.940
I'm glad you're
a believer, baby,

17:19.942 --> 17:24.661
but I'm never gonna believe
in an "enigma of the mystical"

17:24.663 --> 17:27.830
unless I see it
with my own eyes.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.750
Because the truth is,

17:29.752 --> 17:34.254
my father never taught me
believe in anything but myself.

17:34.256 --> 17:38.092
Well, if it helps at all,
I believe in you, too.

17:39.978 --> 17:43.013
Then there's a pretty
good chance I don't exist.

17:43.015 --> 17:44.264
How dare you?!

17:48.086 --> 17:50.354
Oh, my God!

17:50.356 --> 17:53.190
This is Robin Scherbatsky
filling in for Sandy Rivers.

17:53.192 --> 17:55.075
You know, America,

17:55.077 --> 17:58.412
tonight I've been groped,
stepped in puke

17:58.437 --> 17:59.447
and until 10 minutes ago

17:59.448 --> 18:03.500
had no idea I would be
on national television.

18:03.502 --> 18:04.718
That's my girl.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.006
But that's the magic
of New Year's.

18:07.031 --> 18:08.931
When that clock
strikes midnight,

18:08.991 --> 18:10.424
we all get a fresh start.

18:10.426 --> 18:14.595
And I don't know about you,
but I could really use one.

18:14.597 --> 18:18.465
And that magic moment
starts in ten...

18:18.467 --> 18:20.167
nine...

18:20.169 --> 18:23.487
<i>That night became a turning</i>
<i>point in Robin's career.</i>

18:26.524 --> 18:28.392
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

18:29.477 --> 18:31.028
They're nice hats, Doug.

18:31.030 --> 18:34.014
They're wet
but they're nice.

18:34.016 --> 18:37.017
...three, two, one.

18:41.206 --> 18:43.073
And that's the story
of New Year's Eve.

18:43.075 --> 18:44.958
You know, I've been thinking

18:44.960 --> 18:47.628
that the reason I got so intense
with Lily

18:47.630 --> 18:51.131
about <i>Enigmas of the Mystical</i>
is that, well...

18:51.133 --> 18:53.250
Could you pass the pickles?

18:54.919 --> 18:57.921
...with you gone, I feel
the mystical a little less.

18:57.923 --> 19:00.090
Can you hand me the chips?

19:00.092 --> 19:02.926
Sometimes
I feel you a little less.

19:02.928 --> 19:06.713
That's why today was
so important because I just...

19:06.715 --> 19:07.881
I needed to...

19:10.718 --> 19:14.905
Did you just open a beer
on my father's headstone?

19:14.907 --> 19:16.406
Actually, it's a hard cider.

19:16.408 --> 19:19.660
<i>And just as he was about</i>
<i>to lose it...</i>

19:19.662 --> 19:21.445
Hey, Marvin, can you

19:21.447 --> 19:22.863
