(Tami)
HEY, HON.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.345
THANK YOU, SHEL.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.138
OF COURSE, BABY.
ANYTIME.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.185
SEE YOU LATER, HON.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.229
[door shuts]

29:39.653 --> 29:41.113
SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.781
I KNOW.
I KNOW SHE IS.

29:42.781 --> 29:43.615
I KNOW SHE'S REALLY UPSET.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.491
WELL, SHE'S EMBARRASSED.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.325
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I NEED A MEDIATOR

29:45.367 --> 29:47.285
TO HELP ME WITH MY DAUGHTER,
SHELLY.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.036
OKAY.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.287
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU WERE RIGHT.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.664
I KNOW YOU DO.

29:50.664 --> 29:51.373
AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
HONESTLY,

29:51.415 --> 29:52.332
MOST OF THE TIME
YOU ARE RIGHT.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.043
BUT IN THIS SITUATION,
DO YOU REALLY THINK

29:55.085 --> 29:56.712
THAT REAMING THAT GUY
A NEW ONE

29:56.753 --> 29:57.921
IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.631
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT WAS
THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THIS?

29:59.631 --> 30:01.299
FIRST OF ALL,
I DID NOT REAM THAT GUY...

30:01.299 --> 30:02.175
A NEW ONE IN FRONT
OF THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

30:02.217 --> 30:03.176
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
JULIE SAID HAPPENED.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.722
WELL, I'M SURE THAT IS
WHAT SHE SAID HAPPENED.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.640
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.641
AND, YOU KNOW, FRANKLY,

30:09.683 --> 30:11.059
YOU'RE NOT A MOTHER.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.061
SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THE SITUATION WAS

30:13.103 --> 30:13.979
THAT I WAS IN.

30:13.979 --> 30:14.771
OH, MY GOD, SOMETIME WE ARE
GONNA HAVE

30:14.813 --> 30:16.648
A WHOLE CONVERSATION
WHERE YOU...

30:16.648 --> 30:17.774
WHERE YOU DON'T SAY THAT TO ME.

30:25.282 --> 30:28.326
SERIOUSLY, TAMI,
HONESTLY...

30:28.326 --> 30:30.996
IF MOM HAD DONE THAT,
HOW WOULD YOU HAVE FELT?

30:43.341 --> 30:45.719
I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE FELT MORTIFIED.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.015
EXACTLY.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.690
THOU DOST PREPAREST
A TABLE BEFORE ME

30:58.690 --> 31:00.275
IN THE PRESENCE
OF MY ENEMIES.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.694
MY CUP OVERFLOWS.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.029
SURELY GOODNESS
AND LOVE KINDNESS

31:04.029 --> 31:06.198
WILL FOLLOW ME
ALL THE DAYS OF MY LIFE

31:06.198 --> 31:08.700
AND I WILL DWELL
IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD

31:08.700 --> 31:10.702
FOREVER AND EVER

31:10.702 --> 31:11.787
SO WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN TO US?

31:11.828 --> 31:14.247
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?
ME?

31:14.247 --> 31:17.793
THAT MEANS IF WE PUT
OUR TRUST IN THE LORD,

31:17.834 --> 31:18.877
HIS PROMISES WILL...

31:18.877 --> 31:21.213
OPEN UP TO US.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.380
WE WILL SEE HIS PROMISES.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.340
DOES EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND?

31:23.381 --> 31:26.051
SHOULD WE TRUST GOD?
SHOULD WE BELIEVE HIM?

31:26.051 --> 31:29.721
SHOULD WE PUT GOD FIRST?
YES.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.807
HIS PROMISES ARE RIGHT HERE.
DWELL IN THE LAND.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.141
PAUL, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.392
OKAY.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.728
AND CULTIVATE FAITHFULNESS.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.731
HEY, LANDRY.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.399
YOU OKAY?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.819
YEAH.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.029
JUST, YOU LOOK LIKE
MAYBE YOU NEEDED SOME COMPANY.

31:51.368 --> 31:55.205
I MEAN,
YOU CAN SIT IF YOU WANT.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.915
OKAY.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.424
SO ARE YOU A GOOD CHRISTIAN
OR A BAD CHRISTIAN,

32:06.424 --> 32:08.176
LYLA GARRITY?

32:08.218 --> 32:10.846
UM...

32:10.887 --> 32:13.181
I TRY
AND BE A GOOD CHRISTIAN.

32:13.223 --> 32:17.519
SO, UH...

32:17.561 --> 32:21.189
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
SO EASY TO TELL, THOUGH.

32:21.231 --> 32:24.901
I DON'T THINK
ANY OF US ARE PERFECT.

32:26.236 --> 32:28.780
I KNOW I'M NOT.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.115
ARE YOU?

32:30.115 --> 32:33.785
[laughs]

32:33.827 --> 32:35.787
NOT SO MUCH.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.248
[clears throat]

32:38.290 --> 32:40.500
I'VE HAD THIS SECRET...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.127
FOR A WHILE NOW.

32:42.127 --> 32:45.380
AND IT'S STARTING TO LITERALLY
JUST EAT AWAY AT ME.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.299
SEEMS SO EASY
TO JUST TELL THE TRUTH.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.258
TO GET IT ALL
OFF YOUR CHEST.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.135
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
SEEMS SO EASY TO DO.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.138
BUT I'VE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE
INVOLVED IN THIS.

32:53.138 --> 32:56.808
I JUST DON'T‐‐I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

32:56.808 --> 32:57.976
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG

32:57.976 --> 32:59.227
IN TELLING THE TRUTH.

32:59.269 --> 33:03.315
I THINK THAT...

33:03.315 --> 33:05.150
TELLING THE TRUTH
IS A WAY

33:05.192 --> 33:08.069
OF SURRENDERING TO GOD.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.988
MAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

33:09.988 --> 33:10.989
IF I WERE TO DO THAT.

33:11.031 --> 33:13.491
I MEAN...

33:13.491 --> 33:16.494
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT FAITH.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.506
JUST TELL THE TRUTH, HUH?

33:28.548 --> 33:30.800
JUST TELL THE TRUTH.

34:10.924 --> 34:14.219
LIKE, AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP.
