could go out dancing.

- Feel what?

11:56.550 --> 11:59.517
- There is something
very strong.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.621
Something that is
drawing us together.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.623
- I bet you I can guess
what it is.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.442
I had a bottle of wine.
I mean...

12:24.544 --> 12:27.579

the wine.

the wine.

all of it.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.738
But we as humans,
we choose to numb it.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.541
We dull it, we ignore it.

But that does not mean
it does not exist.

know I'm right.

- So it's gonna
take some time.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.357
- But how?

34:54.459 --> 34:57.494
I mean, maybe I'm not
supposed to

34:57.596 --> 34:59.863
'cause now we have a
baby finally coming.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.898
I have to see him.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.834
I want to see him.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.770
I don't want to see that --
woman but I want to see him.

35:06.872 --> 35:08.138
- Fatima...
- Right, yes.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.507
I don't care, okay?
I don't like the -- bitch.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.175
I don't!

35:12.277 --> 35:13.276
I don't!

35:13.378 --> 35:14.344
- Okay.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.879
- KAREN: I'm supposed to
like her?

35:15.981 --> 35:17.681
I'm supposed to be friends
with her?

35:17.783 --> 35:20.083
Talking about, "Oh, I had
all this patching up to do."

35:20.185 --> 35:21.484
Yeah, well try carrying him.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.753
And why y'all, why y'all so
close to her, huh?

35:23.856 --> 35:26.456
Why, why?
- I'm not, Karen.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.359
- That's wrong!
It's all wrong, Danni.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.761
- Okay Karen, can I remind
you of all the hoes?

35:31.864 --> 35:33.630
- I remember.

35:33.732 --> 35:34.865
- Alright, all of the shit.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.433
All the bad shit.
- Yes, yes, I remember.

35:36.535 --> 35:38.869
I have not forgotten. I was
there, thank you very much.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.804
- Can we not just remember
the good then?

35:40.906 --> 35:45.275
All the love,
let's remember that.

35:45.377 --> 35:50.947
- How can he just turn around
and be so happy, though, huh?

35:51.049 --> 35:52.515
- Some people, they just
got that--

35:52.618 --> 35:54.551
- No Danni, Danni...

35:54.653 --> 35:56.519
Please don't do that.
Don't give me that.

35:56.622 --> 35:57.687
- What did I do?

35:57.789 --> 36:00.290
What did I, what did I,
or what did I not do?

36:00.392 --> 36:04.194
- I came because you're a
friend who tells the truth.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.229
- We all tell the truth.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.765
- No, but you tell it without
giving a shit about my feelings.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.401
So tell me.

36:15.007 --> 36:18.141
- He's moved on
and he's happy.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.146
- You really believe that?

36:23.248 --> 36:26.016
- Yeah, I do.

36:26.118 --> 36:29.152
- You don't think he's trying
to make me jealous like always.

36:29.254 --> 36:31.354
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Knowing Zac,

36:31.456 --> 36:35.926
oh yeah, he's definitely trying
to rub your nose in it.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.794
But he loves her.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.963
- You think so?

36:40.065 --> 36:42.999
- Listen, I look at him and
whatever the hell

36:43.101 --> 36:46.870
she's doing to him, he's
loving it, okay?

36:46.972 --> 36:49.306
Like with me and Preston,
sometimes people

36:49.408 --> 36:52.108
just aren't right
for each other.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.045
You gotta let him go.

36:55.147 --> 36:57.047
- But, I love him.

36:57.149 --> 37:00.150
- I know.

37:00.252 --> 37:03.119
- I'm not ready to do that.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.988
- Well, you're gonna have to.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.824
- No, I don't.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.094
I love him and he loves me.

37:11.196 --> 37:14.698
He said it.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.566
- So, so, what are you going
to do Karen?

37:16.668 --> 37:20.170
- I'ma go to him, actually.
Yeah.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.138
I'ma go to him.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.809
I'ma get him back.

37:25.911 --> 37:29.579
- What does that mean?
- It means I'ma get him back.

37:29.681 --> 37:33.416
- Okay, I'm telling you, you
have to let this go.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.086
He is in love with her.
This is not gonna work.

37:36.188 --> 37:38.121
- Danni, you don't know
him like I do.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.490
You know him but you
don't know him like I do.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.525
- Karen...
- I'm gonna go, Danni.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.661
I'ma go.
- You wanted me to tell you

37:44.763 --> 37:46.296
the truth, right?
- Yeah, yeah. I did.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.798
- Okay, so let him go.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.368
- Okay, Danni,
I'ma just go.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.570
- DANNI: No!
No, no, no.

37:53.672 --> 37:56.239
Karen...
- What?

37:56.341 --> 37:59.075
- Let this go, okay?

37:59.177 --> 38:01.177
Spend some time with Aaron.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.179
Zac is gone, baby.
Trust me.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.181
- We'll see.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.683
- Karen...
-What?

38:06.785 --> 38:09.252
- I think your hormones
might be a little out of whack.

38:09.354 --> 38:11.488
- Okay, don't do that, Danni.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.757
You act like I don't know
what I'm saying.

38:13.859 --> 38:16.393
- Oh, you know. But I don't know
if you can hear yourself.

38:16.495 --> 38:17.894
Do you?
- Danni, come on.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.096
Please, just...
- Uh-uh.

38:20.198 --> 38:21.564
- KAREN: What?
- You come over here,

38:21.666 --> 38:25.402
you blow my high and you want
me to tell you the truth.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.137
Okay, that's what I'm doing.

38:27.239 --> 38:29.706
I'm telling you the truth!
Let it go!

38:29.808 --> 38:32.675

I will find a piece of paper

38:32.778 --> 38:35.445

- Yes, he is! I see it.

38:43.255 --> 38:45.855
- Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.390
