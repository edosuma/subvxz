RANGER CARL: At the
Outdoor Education Center,

00:22.399 --> 00:23.794
nature is the classroom.

00:23.836 --> 00:25.729
But it's not just bonding over fox scat.

00:25.771 --> 00:27.931
These kids bond through team building.

00:27.973 --> 00:30.134
Teamwork is the only
way to get to the top

00:30.176 --> 00:31.935
of Mount Windygap.

00:31.977 --> 00:33.737
It's a powerful experience,
like an epiphany,

00:33.779 --> 00:36.140
- a nature-iphany.
- Wow.

00:36.182 --> 00:37.862
I can't wait to be on
top of Mount Windygap

00:37.904 --> 00:39.143
and have my nature-iphany.

00:39.185 --> 00:40.545
Well, I'm just excited to blow off

00:40.587 --> 00:42.768
four days of school at Outdoor Ed.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.437
You're not blowing off school, Missy.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.272
Your teachers are gonna
be there, teaching.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.606
Doesn't mean I got to learn.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.041
It's gonna be hard not to learn

00:49.083 --> 00:50.683
with nature doing
most of the teaching...

00:50.725 --> 00:52.545
and changing, of our lives.

Well, what is it? What is it?

01:15.810 --> 01:17.770
(SIGHS) I was in the girls' bathroom,

01:17.812 --> 01:19.738
all alone, and I
started singing the song

01:38.165 --> 01:40.444
- And in the hall.
- And morning announcements.

01:40.486 --> 01:42.446
It starts to seem like
people aren't being fluffy,

01:42.488 --> 01:44.363
fun and friendly, like
it says on the package.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.999
Sorry, Tina. Hey, nicknames

BUT BE CAREFUL: The more you
fight it, the more it sticks.

01:49.744 --> 01:53.539
I knew a kid who had to change
schools 'cause of a nickname.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.875

No one you know.

RANGER CARL: If you get bit by a tick,

02:13.401 --> 02:15.027
let Mr. Tweezers know.

02:15.069 --> 02:17.463
If you get a splinter,
also a job for Mr. Tweezers.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.399
Oh, and, uh, another topic,
totally unrelated to safety:

02:20.441 --> 02:23.669
There may or may not be someone
living in the woods nearby.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.705
The so-called "Windygap
Hermit," he's not dangerous...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.307
Or, maybe he is, we really don't know.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.109
I mean, there have been
some missing hatchets

02:30.151 --> 02:32.111
and some other things,
but they could be anywhere.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.879
So if anyone notices
anything suspicious,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.401
- please tell...
- ZEKE: Mr. Tweezers?

02:35.443 --> 02:36.482
Uh, no. Me.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.918
Ranger Carl. Or Mr. Tweezers, yeah.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.600
- I'll probably tell Tweezers.
- I get it.

02:40.642 --> 02:42.923
Now, we're gonna do things a
little differently this week,

02:42.965 --> 02:45.758
because they're predicting
rain for the next few days.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.493
There's gonna be a lot more indoor ed

02:47.535 --> 02:49.695
- here at the Outdoor Ed Center.
- JOCELYN: Wait, what?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.956
- ZEKE: Come on.
- Yes?

02:50.998 --> 02:53.358
But we're still gonna team-build
on the ropes course, right?

02:53.400 --> 02:55.901
No, the ropes course isn't
safe in the rain. Yes?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.781
But we're still gonna
hike to the top of Mount

02:57.824 --> 02:59.423
Windygap, for our
nature-iphanies, right?

02:59.465 --> 03:02.041
No, the last quarter mile of
that trail is in a steep notch.

03:02.083 --> 03:03.709
It's like the mountain's rain gutter.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.945
Totally impassable in
bad weather. Really?

03:05.987 --> 03:07.613
But what if the rain
stops before Friday?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.214
Well, it's not supposed to.
But what if it does?

03:09.256 --> 03:10.716
Well, I don't think it will.
But what if it does?

03:10.758 --> 03:13.092
Well, there's no sense discussing that,
because it's not gonna happen.

03:13.134 --> 03:14.720
- Damn it.
- (WHISPERS): Sorry, T.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.256
At least we still get a few
days of blowing off school.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.360
For those of you who
think you're just gonna

03:19.403 --> 03:21.560
blow off school while
we're up here, forget it.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.697
You'll have your regular
classwork, plus nature stuff.

03:24.739 --> 03:26.899
- Oh, man.
- Son of a bitch.

03:26.941 --> 03:30.035
TEDDY: Wow. Three big nights alone.
So what's the plan?

03:30.077 --> 03:31.403
Well, we haven't made any plans.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.748
Wait, aren't you excited to
have couple time together?

03:33.790 --> 03:35.407
- Of course we are.
- Um, yes.

03:35.449 --> 03:36.742
Oh, then let's brainstorm.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.264
There's, uh, stand-up comedy classes.

03:38.306 --> 03:39.545
- Ah.
- Uh...

03:39.587 --> 03:41.246
- There's couples hot therapy.
- Ooh. -Mm.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.248
There's watching hockey
with a friend. Huh?

03:43.290 --> 03:45.084
- Hmm...
- All those things sound great.

03:45.126 --> 03:46.652
Ooh! We're gonna go crazy.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.554
(BOTH SNORING)

03:48.596 --> 03:49.755
(YAWNS)

03:49.797 --> 03:51.724
- Lin.
- What? What? What?

03:51.766 --> 03:53.225
We fell asleep on the couch.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.594
What? Did we do anything fun?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.230
I mean, we ate a lot of cheese.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.229
Ugh, carry me to bed.

04:00.271 --> 04:02.271
Ugh, carry me to bed.

04:02.792 --> 04:05.504
TINA: I don't remember kids being all
cooped up in the video.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.786
We're supposed to be out there.

04:06.828 --> 04:08.340
Up to our asses in nature.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.676
Whoa, Tina, nature's
all around you, girl.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.111
This napkin came from a tree.

04:12.153 --> 04:14.313
Yeah, and this syrup... tree.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.081
Sausage... tree.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.817
- Hey, Fluffy-B, pass the salt.
- Ugh! That's it.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.084
I need some space.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.194
How about that salt? Little help?

04:23.081 --> 04:25.024
I don't think you're
supposed to be out here.

04:25.066 --> 04:26.706
Well, I didn't come
all this way to not go

04:26.748 --> 04:28.156
on a life-changing nature hike.

04:28.198 --> 04:29.928
- Who's coming with me?
- Ugh, fine.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.730
We'll go with you on
your life-changing hike.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.931
Just make it quick.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.134
Hey, let's go off-trail
to find some fox scat.

04:35.176 --> 04:36.642
A scat-Enger hunt.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.505
Is it everything you hoped it'd be?

04:39.547 --> 04:40.606
(SIGHS)

04:40.648 --> 04:41.974
We can go back now, if you want.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.215
Already walking.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.678
Huh, where's that darn trail?

04:45.720 --> 04:48.380
Whoa. What the hell is this place?

04:48.422 --> 04:51.784
Can't even see all this
from just back there.

04:51.826 --> 04:53.819
It's literally off the beaten path.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.020
Do you think someone's here?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.855
We should ask that lady holding an axe!

04:56.897 --> 04:58.971
- Hi.
- (SCREAMING)

05:03.088 --> 05:04.470
(MOANING)

05:04.512 --> 05:05.800
Wait, you're scared?

05:05.847 --> 05:07.239
I'm the one who should be scared.

05:07.281 --> 05:09.220
You're barging in
without knocking. Rude.

05:09.262 --> 05:11.879
Right, but you're the
one with the axe. So...

05:11.921 --> 05:13.170
This? (LAUGHING) Oh...

05:13.212 --> 05:15.079
I was just playing darts.

05:15.167 --> 05:16.167
Whoa.

05:16.209 --> 05:17.489
Live out here as long as I have,

05:17.531 --> 05:18.931
and you get tossy with the hatchet.

05:18.973 --> 05:20.156
Wait, you live here?

05:20.198 --> 05:21.798
Are the hermit Ranger
Carl told us about?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.025
The Windygap Hermit?

05:23.067 --> 05:25.762
"Hermit"? Really? That's
what society is calling me?

05:25.804 --> 05:27.830
Not the Wonder Woman of the Woods?

05:27.872 --> 05:29.298
No, just "hermit."

05:29.340 --> 05:31.200
I hate labels.

05:31.242 --> 05:33.503
(INHALES, EXHALES)

05:33.545 --> 05:34.777
Labels.

05:35.205 --> 05:36.205
All better.

05:36.247 --> 05:38.808
What was that totally
normal thing you just did?

05:38.850 --> 05:40.810
A cleansing ritual I made up.

05:40.852 --> 05:42.358
Does it work?
Don't I look cleansed?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.400
Eh. Yes? Uh...

05:43.442 --> 05:46.331
So what's a girl got to do to
get a turn throwing that thing?

05:46.373 --> 05:48.629
You want me to teach you
how to throw a hatchet?

05:48.671 --> 05:50.269
Um, does a hermit
scat in the woods?

05:50.311 --> 05:52.188
There they are. Party animals.

05:52.230 --> 05:53.656
So what'd you do? Where'd you go?

05:53.698 --> 05:56.325
- We, um...
- Oh, we ate a bunch of cheese

05:56.367 --> 05:58.394
and fell asleep on the couch.

05:58.436 --> 05:59.836
What? You fell asleep on the couch?

05:59.878 --> 06:01.464
This time is a gift.

06:01.506 --> 06:03.666
It's a chance to
reconnect with one another.

06:03.708 --> 06:05.188
Why do I have to explain this to you?

06:05.230 --> 06:06.469
Okay, Teddy, calm down.

06:06.511 --> 06:07.570
We were tired.

06:07.612 --> 06:09.205
We'll make up for it tonight.

06:09.247 --> 06:11.367
Damn right you will. And
when I come in here tomorrow,

06:11.409 --> 06:13.509
I better be dazzled
by your date tonight.

06:13.551 --> 06:15.351
Dazzled! (PANTING)

06:15.592 --> 06:16.979
What burger today, Bobby?

06:17.021 --> 06:19.148
"Paprika," that sounds pretty good.

06:19.190 --> 06:22.653
So how long have you lived
here, um, Hermit Lady?

06:22.695 --> 06:25.021
My name's Martha...
Uh, well, it used to be.

06:25.063 --> 06:28.024
The wind spoke through the
trees, and I was born anew as...

06:28.066 --> 06:30.567
(WHOOSHING)

06:30.609 --> 06:32.428
Cool if we just call you "Martha"?

06:32.470 --> 06:34.197
- Sure.
- Thanks. We don't speak wind.

06:34.239 --> 06:35.832
What do you kids go by?

06:35.874 --> 06:37.667
That's Louise, he's Gene and I'm Tina.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.602
But I'm hoping to get
a nature name of my own.

06:39.644 --> 06:41.604
- Teagle.
- That's up to nature, now, isn't it?

06:41.646 --> 06:43.606
First, you got to level up.

06:43.648 --> 06:45.041
"Level up"? What's that?

06:45.083 --> 06:46.676
"Level up"? It's level up.

06:46.718 --> 06:47.777
Level up!

06:47.819 --> 06:49.412
Oh, like, level up.

06:49.454 --> 06:51.214
Yeah, you got it. Level up.

06:51.256 --> 06:54.697
I was supposed to level up, when-when we
did the hike to the top of Mount Windygap.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.268
Now that's not gonna happen.
Why not?

06:56.311 --> 06:58.434
Cause we're not allowed to
do the team-building ropes

06:58.477 --> 07:00.557
course in the rain, or hike
the mountain in the rain.

07:00.599 --> 07:02.458
It's a real "blame it
on the rain" situation.

07:02.500 --> 07:03.526
Team building?

07:03.568 --> 07:06.536
You really think other people are gonna
help you get what you want in life?

07:06.578 --> 07:07.978
It looked really good in the video.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.199
Take it from a hermit... teams are dumb.

07:10.241 --> 07:12.902
- Feels like it's almost lunch.
- Oh, we better go.

07:12.944 --> 07:15.504
If we don't show up for the next
meal, they're gonna look for us.

07:15.546 --> 07:17.573
Uh, I hate to be that
lady you met in the woods

07:17.615 --> 07:20.476
who's like, "Hey, kids,
don't tell anyone about this,"

07:20.518 --> 07:22.238
but, uh, can you not
tell anyone about this?

07:22.280 --> 07:23.280
About me?

07:23.322 --> 07:24.788
You got it, fun stranger.

07:25.456 --> 07:27.149
Where are you kids coming from?

07:27.191 --> 07:28.584
We just stepped out for a smoke.

07:28.626 --> 07:31.287
Well, I guess in all this rain,
you can't burn down the forest.

07:31.329 --> 07:32.889
Hey, but also, don't smoke. (CHUCKLES)

07:32.931 --> 07:34.531
You know, I can't tell if you're joking.

07:34.573 --> 07:35.625
Well, let's get inside.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.307
It's time to learn
our famous weasel song.

07:37.349 --> 07:38.549
I can't tell if you're joking.

07:38.591 --> 07:39.962
Well, I've got the weasel.

07:40.004 --> 07:41.731
You can pretty much
see that I'm not joking.

07:41.773 --> 07:44.133

sing ♪ Who's that ♪

07:53.225 --> 07:55.478
Oh, just off, trying to level up.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.979
"Level up"? What's that?

07:57.021 --> 07:58.648
What's F-Butt fluffering about?

07:58.690 --> 07:59.849
You know what, Tammy?

07:59.891 --> 08:02.084
Wait, no, I know what to do.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.686

08:03.728 --> 08:04.754
Labels.

08:04.796 --> 08:06.822
Wow, that did feel good.

08:06.864 --> 08:08.691
Whoa, did you just call me "Labels"?

08:08.733 --> 08:10.793
- No, I was...
- It's not nice to call people names.

08:10.835 --> 08:13.262
Huh? No, no, that's what you
guys have been doing to me.

08:13.304 --> 08:15.304
- I was just...
- Not cool, Fluffy-Butt-Label-Face.

08:24.893 --> 08:26.375
Dinner and two movies.

08:26.417 --> 08:28.277
All I know is, we're gonna go nuts.

08:28.319 --> 08:29.946
Let's get this party start...

08:29.988 --> 08:31.948
(BOTH SNORING)

08:31.990 --> 08:35.791
- Oh, no, oh, no. No.
- What? Wait, what? What happened?

08:35.835 --> 08:38.621
We fell asleep on the couch again.

08:38.663 --> 08:40.222
Maybe we're too old to have fun.

08:40.264 --> 08:41.857
I'm not old, you're old.

08:41.899 --> 08:43.192
Going back to sleep.

08:43.234 --> 08:44.561
Rub my bunions.

08:44.603 --> 08:46.396
First stop when we get home... (GRUNTS)

08:46.438 --> 08:47.682
(HATCHET THUNKS) hatchet store.

08:47.725 --> 08:50.714
And then, I did the cleansing ritual
and felt better for, like, a second.

08:50.756 --> 08:52.596
But then, they started
all over again. (GROANS)

08:52.638 --> 08:55.005
Why do you care so much
what these other kids think?

08:55.047 --> 08:57.674
Because... I don't know, I-I just do.

08:57.716 --> 09:00.177
It's because you're living
your life for other people.

09:00.219 --> 09:02.346
I am? Huh. Maybe I am.

09:02.388 --> 09:03.547
I used to be just like you.

09:03.589 --> 09:05.082
I thought I had it all.

09:05.124 --> 09:07.976
The one bedroom apartment,
the Nissan Altima lease, the

09:08.019 --> 09:10.675
job at a brand management
company in an office park.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.199
But ever since I was like
"see ya" to society,

09:13.242 --> 09:15.258
I don't care what
anyone thinks of me.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.728
Wow, and I thought Outdoor
Ed was gonna open my eyes.

09:17.770 --> 09:20.330
But it turns out, it
took a weird lady hermit.

09:20.372 --> 09:22.332
AND HER THREE AMAZING HATCHETS:

09:22.374 --> 09:25.335
Buddy Hatchet, Teri
Hatchet and Orrin Hatchet.

09:25.377 --> 09:26.703
Still, it would've been great

09:26.745 --> 09:28.271
to get to the top of Mount Windygap.

09:28.313 --> 09:32.776
Yep, old Mount Windygap,
so gappy, so windy.

09:32.818 --> 09:35.712
Oh, my God, you've been to
the top of Mount Windygap?

09:35.754 --> 09:37.514
- Mm-hmm.
- By yourself?

09:37.556 --> 09:39.082
Yeah, uh, yep. Mm-hmm.

09:39.124 --> 09:40.618
Huh. I thought the
only way to get

09:40.661 --> 09:41.899
to the top was with teamwork.

09:41.941 --> 09:43.086
I think you're my hero.

09:43.128 --> 09:44.621
I want a poster of you.
(GRUNTS)

09:44.663 --> 09:46.930
And how has this not replaced golf?

09:51.041 --> 09:52.961
LINDA: Don't even think
about that couch, mister.

09:53.003 --> 09:54.297
I'm not. Much.

09:54.339 --> 09:55.732
What's taking you so long?

09:55.774 --> 09:57.376
I wanted to change my look a

09:57.419 --> 09:59.436
little, get in the
mood to go out.

09:59.478 --> 10:01.071
Can't stay home looking like this, huh?

10:01.113 --> 10:02.272
Ha, ha!

10:02.314 --> 10:04.274
I'm Miami Beach bronze, baby.

10:04.316 --> 10:06.438
You used a tanning spray?

10:06.480 --> 10:07.862
I'm a hottie in another body.

10:07.904 --> 10:09.613
Mm. Does that body have jaundice?

10:09.655 --> 10:11.114
Yeah, well, now, you have jaundice.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.215
Ha.
Ow! Hey, stop.

10:12.257 --> 10:13.550
- (LAUGHS)
- Oh, man... ugh.

10:13.592 --> 10:14.985
It isn't coming off.

10:15.027 --> 10:17.087
Well, there's only one thing to do now.

10:17.129 --> 10:19.790
Lin, there's a reason I
never wear these old clothes.

10:19.832 --> 10:22.659
Okay, that white sport coat
might make me look incredible.

10:22.701 --> 10:24.995
And it does. You look good, too.

10:25.037 --> 10:26.477
Actually, I don't know how you look,

10:26.519 --> 10:28.565
'cause I can't take my eyes off me.

10:28.607 --> 10:29.966
♪ Oh, yeah. ♪

10:30.008 --> 10:31.668
Just an FYI, Tammy.

10:31.710 --> 10:33.830
I don't care what other
people think about me anymore,

10:33.872 --> 10:35.439
- so, yeah, good night.
- Really?

10:35.481 --> 10:37.943
Yep. - So you don't care if
we call you "Flufficus-Butticus"?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.544
Which is, of course, the
Latin name for your species.

10:39.586 --> 10:40.777
Nope. Not at all.

10:40.819 --> 10:43.146
What about "Fluff With a Side of Butt"?

10:43.188 --> 10:44.781
Nope.

10:44.823 --> 10:46.683
BOB: Oh, my God.

10:46.725 --> 10:48.518
Wh-Why do we have to go dancing here?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.587
There has to be a place that's, like,

10:50.629 --> 10:52.509
- more from the present.
- What'll it be, chief?

10:52.551 --> 10:53.957
Oh. Chief. I like chief.

10:53.999 --> 10:55.439
Yeah, you do. What are you drinkin'?

10:55.481 --> 10:57.527
Um, I-I don't know. What should I get?

10:57.569 --> 10:58.962
Two Long Island Iced Teas.

10:59.004 --> 11:00.797
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! (RHYTHMIC GRUNTING)

11:00.839 --> 11:03.100

11:07.312 --> 11:09.306
(CACKLING LAUGHTER)

11:09.348 --> 11:11.441
Oh, we never want this night to end!

11:11.483 --> 11:13.944
- Oh, it ended.
- That's it, people. We're closed.

11:13.986 --> 11:17.047
- Hey, our kids are out of town.
- Party at our place!

11:17.089 --> 11:18.315

Lin. Lin.

11:25.589 --> 11:28.725
- Wha-Wha-Wha...?
- (GROANS) Did we bring people back here?

11:28.767 --> 11:30.227
Yeah, I think we did.

11:30.269 --> 11:31.695
Are we really cool now?

11:31.737 --> 11:33.230
I think we are.

11:33.272 --> 11:35.065
Oh, no.

11:35.107 --> 11:36.900
- No, no, no!
- Oh, God!

11:36.942 --> 11:39.743
Linda! Why did you
bring people back here?

11:40.627 --> 11:42.280
I'm never gonna stop caring
what people think about me

11:42.322 --> 11:43.673
if I'm too afraid to level up.

11:43.715 --> 11:45.976
I got to get to the
top of Mount Windygap.

11:46.018 --> 11:47.744
Martha did it alone, so I can, too.

11:47.786 --> 11:50.147
P.S. I had another dream
where Jimmy Jr. and Zeke

11:50.189 --> 11:51.709
switched heads... What's up with that?

11:51.751 --> 11:53.483

- Hatchet o'clock.

12:00.112 --> 12:01.858
Yep. Where's Tina?

12:01.900 --> 12:03.160
She's not here.

12:03.202 --> 12:04.895
Did she go see Martha without us?

12:04.937 --> 12:08.243
This is why we need to
put a GPS chip in that gal!

12:08.285 --> 12:10.500
Or what if we read her journal?

12:10.542 --> 12:11.568
Blah, blah, blah.

12:11.610 --> 12:13.737
Teen stuff. Hormones.

12:13.779 --> 12:16.999
(GASPS) Tina's going to the top
of Mount Windygap by herself?

12:17.041 --> 12:18.742
- Aah!
- And she's having that dream again.

12:18.784 --> 12:21.044
The one where Jimmy Jr.
And Zeke switch heads?

12:21.086 --> 12:23.182
- Yeah.
- What's up with that?

12:26.378 --> 12:29.758
Come on, Teagle, you
can do this. No, I can't.

12:29.800 --> 12:32.315
That's Tina speaking.
Don't listen to her, Teagle.

12:32.933 --> 12:34.826
Martha? Martha!

12:34.868 --> 12:37.028
- (IN DISTANCE): Way to go. Level up.
- Shh, shh. Wait.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.838
Do you hear that? It's
coming from in there.

12:44.753 --> 12:46.346
Is that a towel warmer?

12:46.388 --> 12:48.081
(GASPS) You're no hermit!

12:48.123 --> 12:50.950
You're not even a camper!
You're a glamper. Ugh.

12:50.992 --> 12:54.193
- Way to go. Level up.
- "Level up" is from a video game?

- (SIGHS): Yeah.
- Letting Go...

12:56.064 --> 12:58.024
Cleansing Rituals for Divorced Men.

12:58.066 --> 13:00.026
(GASPS) I suppose you didn't even think

13:00.068 --> 13:02.695
of that slightly underwhelming
cleansing ritual yourself!

13:02.737 --> 13:04.964
It came from this disc of sadness!

13:05.006 --> 13:06.599
Where'd you get all this stuff?

13:06.641 --> 13:08.634
Mostly from the ranger's cabin.

13:08.676 --> 13:10.470
We believed you. We
believed that you were

13:10.512 --> 13:12.138
the Wonder Woman of the Woods.

13:12.180 --> 13:14.874
I know. I got excited.
I almost believed me.

13:14.916 --> 13:17.810
I mean, I was the Wonder
Woman of the Woods at first,

13:17.852 --> 13:19.746
for a day... Well, for half a day.

13:19.788 --> 13:21.481
Then I got so hungry.

13:21.523 --> 13:23.983
Then I had to steal frozen
food from the Outdoor Ed Center,

13:24.025 --> 13:26.052
and then the microwave
from the ranger's cabin.

13:26.094 --> 13:27.620
And is that a Wi-Fi router?

13:27.662 --> 13:29.255
Yeah. Do you need the password?

13:29.297 --> 13:31.891
- You're a total fraud.
- Um, ouch?

13:31.933 --> 13:34.627
And you probably never climbed
Mount Windygap by yourself.

13:34.669 --> 13:36.162
The mountain? (CHUCKLES)

13:36.204 --> 13:37.830
No. It's a mountain.

to climb that mountain

No. Our sister! Remember?

One was hanging on
your every lying word?

Crap. What could I do?
She was staring at me

- Vomit.
- We went to the Lucky Lizard,

15:17.372 --> 15:19.332
and then some lizards followed us home,

15:19.374 --> 15:21.067
and the whole place is trashed.

15:21.109 --> 15:23.536
Really? I'm proud of
you. I'm so proud of you.

15:23.578 --> 15:25.771
- Thanks, Teddy.
- You guys look weird.

15:25.813 --> 15:28.407
- We got some color.
- Got some color. Good for you.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.376
So, uh, about the burger?

15:30.418 --> 15:31.878
It's gonna be a while, Teddy.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.713
I'll wait. Maybe down
the block a little.

15:33.755 --> 15:35.915
Kind of stinks here. You
stunk up the block, Bobby.

15:35.957 --> 15:37.116
But I'm proud of ya!

15:37.158 --> 15:38.584
FROND: Okay, okay,

15:38.626 --> 15:41.521
Henry Haber got his nasal
irrigation kit. Check.

15:41.563 --> 15:43.229
The Belchers. They-they
wanted something.

15:43.271 --> 15:44.271
Where'd they go?

15:44.313 --> 15:45.925
Everything okay? You
look really sweaty.

15:45.967 --> 15:48.060
It's fine. It's nothing. A
couple of kids were saying

15:48.102 --> 15:50.062
something about their
sister going up the mountain

15:50.104 --> 15:51.931
in the rain, and
something about a hermit.

15:51.973 --> 15:54.233
Probably just messing
with me, out of respect.

15:54.275 --> 15:56.302
- Hermit? Did you say hermit?
- I don't know!

15:56.344 --> 15:59.554
I-I don't have a recording
of everything I've said!

16:00.114 --> 16:03.242
♪ ♪

16:03.284 --> 16:05.111
I'm gonna get you, hermit...

16:05.153 --> 16:07.480
and/or missing kid.

16:07.522 --> 16:09.148
(GRUNTING)

16:09.190 --> 16:12.151
You're not gonna stop me,
rain. I'm almost there.

16:12.193 --> 16:14.548
(RUMBLING)

16:16.196 --> 16:18.316
Aah! Damn it, rain, I didn't
know you were gonna bring

16:18.358 --> 16:20.674
your friends, mud and rocks!

16:22.978 --> 16:25.772
Okay, okay, too steep
in there to go forward,

16:25.814 --> 16:28.522
no trail anymore to go back. Cool, cool.

16:28.564 --> 16:30.557
So I'll just live here. Good plan.

16:30.599 --> 16:32.292
Help!

16:32.334 --> 16:34.751
(PANTING): Wait! Everyone, just wait!

16:34.861 --> 16:37.588
- So you're the Windygap Hermit?
- Yes.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.990
- Eh.
- Barely.

16:39.032 --> 16:42.460
I've dedicated the last 14
days of my life to catching you.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.896
Can this wait? We need
to rescue my sister.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.458
Damn it! You're right. Listen, hermit,

16:46.500 --> 16:48.166
we'll work together to rescue this kid,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.234
but right after that,
you're getting a citation

16:50.276 --> 16:53.444
for illegal camping and
possible microwave taking.

16:53.486 --> 16:54.486
- Fine.
- Great.

16:54.528 --> 16:55.797
Great. Just one more thing.

16:55.839 --> 16:58.437
I wasn't expecting you
to be so... not a man.

16:58.479 --> 17:00.713
Okay, that's it. Let's
go rescue this kid.

17:01.093 --> 17:03.554
Oh... damn you, nature.

17:03.596 --> 17:05.031
GENE: Tina! We're here!

17:05.073 --> 17:06.836
You're gonna live! Probably!

17:06.877 --> 17:09.612
Watch your step. The trail washed out.

17:12.204 --> 17:14.732
- (GASPING)
- JOCELYN: Oh, my God!

17:14.773 --> 17:16.066
- Yeah, it does that.
- Damn!

17:16.108 --> 17:17.968
I think we did this rescue thing wrong!

17:18.010 --> 17:19.336
I'll radio this in.

17:19.377 --> 17:20.547
Oh... crap.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.305
I'm starting to think it was a bad idea

17:22.347 --> 17:24.006
to try this alone...
I'm no warrior hermit

17:24.048 --> 17:25.329
like you, Martha.

17:25.372 --> 17:27.828
Yeah, about that, Martha...

17:27.869 --> 17:29.670
Right. So...

17:29.728 --> 17:33.328
Tina, look, I never reached
the top of Mount Windygap alone.

17:33.370 --> 17:36.254
I'm not really technically
a hermit, I guess.

17:36.296 --> 17:38.913
What? But all that stuff
you said, it seemed so true.

17:38.955 --> 17:40.671
That's because I was throwing a hatchet.

17:40.713 --> 17:43.367
Everything sounds great when
you're throwing a hatchet.

17:43.409 --> 17:46.726
Look, I tried to be a real
hermit, I really, really did,

17:46.768 --> 17:51.287
but it's so hard and so
boring and so wet and so cold.

17:51.329 --> 17:53.879
- So why didn't you just go home?
- It's complicated.

17:53.921 --> 17:55.937
I had my own team-building issues,

17:55.979 --> 17:57.117
and label issues.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.941
Like when your hip
brand management company

17:58.983 --> 18:02.286
expects you to run a small team
and you're stuck with Brian,

18:02.328 --> 18:04.015
who undermines everything!

18:04.057 --> 18:06.584
And I'm the mean lady who
told him to stop saying.

18:06.626 --> 18:09.640
"Brian no likey" during
meetings! That's a label!

18:09.682 --> 18:11.965
Can we talk about this later?
We got to find a way down.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.991
I don't think we can go down.
I think the only way out is up.

18:15.033 --> 18:18.502
(SOBS) I will kill you if
I die out here, Fluffy-Butt!

18:18.544 --> 18:21.004
Me, too. I don't want
to die in this jacket.

18:21.046 --> 18:22.573
Really? I think that jacket's cute.

18:22.615 --> 18:24.575
- You do?
- I'd totally die in that jacket.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.049
Now I wanna die in it.

18:27.090 --> 18:29.928
Oh, yay! Somebody finally
ate my leftover Linguini.

18:29.970 --> 18:32.483
(SIGHS) Do we have to do this?
Can't we just move or something?

18:32.525 --> 18:34.585
No, no, no. The kids
cannot know this happened.

18:34.627 --> 18:36.587
If we get busted for having people over,

18:36.629 --> 18:39.422
we'll never be able to tell them
not to do dumb things like this.

18:39.464 --> 18:40.991
And clean, and clean, and clean.

18:41.033 --> 18:42.459
I'm cleaning, I'm cleaning.

18:42.501 --> 18:44.495
I mean, I'm just
throwing everything away.

18:44.537 --> 18:46.892
- Is that cleaning?
- No, that's a plate!

18:47.106 --> 18:48.565
I don't want to alarm anyone,

18:48.607 --> 18:50.914
but this rain is gonna
wash us off the rock.

18:50.956 --> 18:52.469
And not in a good way!

18:52.511 --> 18:55.439
Outdoor Ed, why have you forsaken us?!

18:55.481 --> 18:57.341
Oh, Outdoor Ed. The Outdoor Ed video.

18:57.383 --> 19:00.144
Guys, we can get to safety.
We'll have to work together.

19:00.186 --> 19:02.146
- Fine, great, let's do it. How?
- In the video, there are

19:02.188 --> 19:04.148
these kids doing this thing
where they put their hands...

19:04.190 --> 19:06.150
You're talking about the
four-man hoist-and-pull.

19:06.192 --> 19:08.452
That won't work. The
rain makes it impossible.

19:08.494 --> 19:10.421
No, not that. It was
a ropes course thing,

19:10.463 --> 19:12.656
where two people lean out
and put their hands together.

19:12.698 --> 19:15.492
- Oh, yeah. The two-man steeple.
- Can we say "person"?

19:15.534 --> 19:18.929
Sorry, all the names are from a
pamphlet Teddy Roosevelt wrote.

19:18.971 --> 19:21.999
Oh, good, really interesting!
Tina, what do we do?!

19:22.041 --> 19:24.521
You lean out towards the person
across from you and grab hands.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.370
Tammy, you and me.
On the count of three.

19:26.412 --> 19:27.671
One, two...

19:27.713 --> 19:28.772
Wait, what? What?

19:28.814 --> 19:30.307
Lean to me now!

19:30.349 --> 19:32.776
It's working! Now we sidestep.

19:32.818 --> 19:34.344
(GRUNTING)

19:34.386 --> 19:36.680
Come on, guys, partner
up and get moving.

19:36.722 --> 19:39.450
- Here we go.
- Here, climb on.

19:39.492 --> 19:41.425
(ALL GRUNTING)

19:44.396 --> 19:46.490
(GASPING)

19:46.532 --> 19:48.192
We made it...

19:48.234 --> 19:50.371
to the top of Mount Windygap!

19:50.836 --> 19:52.663
- Ah...
- Yeah!

19:52.705 --> 19:53.797
- Sweet.
- Wuff.

19:53.839 --> 19:55.399
You guys, it's happening.

19:55.441 --> 19:56.867
We're having our nature-iphanies.

19:56.909 --> 19:59.089
- Do what?
- Our epiphanies in nature.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.871
I'm realizing you can't
level up all alone,

20:00.913 --> 20:02.473
but you also can't rely on other people

20:02.515 --> 20:04.475
to make you feel the
way you want to feel.

20:04.517 --> 20:06.710
It takes both... teamwork
and alone stuff.

20:06.752 --> 20:08.232
- I taught her that.
- So I don't care

20:08.274 --> 20:09.546
if people call me Fluffy-Butt

20:09.588 --> 20:11.248
or Teagle... it doesn't matter.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.983
- Teagle?
- A cross between Tina and eagle.

20:13.025 --> 20:14.818
Anyway, I know who I am.

20:14.860 --> 20:16.887
- (BIRD CRIES)
- (GASPS) An eagle? Where?

20:16.929 --> 20:18.822
- Nah, it's just a crow.
- (HIGH-PITCHED): Fluffy-Butt.

20:18.864 --> 20:21.024
- Did that crow just say "Fluffy-Butt"?
- What? No.

20:21.066 --> 20:22.746
- (HIGH-PITCHED): Fluffy-Butt.
- Oh, maybe.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.348
- Even if it did, I don't mind it.
- (HIGH-PITCHED): Fluffy-Butt.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.497
Okay, that's enough.

20:26.539 --> 20:27.598
So, uh... (CLEARS THROAT)

20:27.640 --> 20:29.867
hermit, is there a his-met?

20:29.909 --> 20:31.869
Ranger Carl, are you hitting on me?

20:31.911 --> 20:33.418
Yeah, he is!

20:34.340 --> 20:36.573
So, how was it? Tell us everything.

20:36.615 --> 20:38.675
(SIGHS): Ah, where do I even begin?

20:38.717 --> 20:39.776
Wait. (SNIFFS)

20:39.818 --> 20:42.042
It smells like beer. And puke.

20:42.084 --> 20:45.048
Uh, that's your mom's,
uh, new, uh, new perfume.

20:45.090 --> 20:48.051
Did you throw a party
while we were out of town?

20:48.093 --> 20:49.920
Some kind of tanning party?

20:49.962 --> 20:52.737
A party? (SCOFFS) Us?
What are you... No!

20:52.779 --> 20:55.359
GENE: There's a
middle-aged lady in my bed.

20:55.401 --> 20:57.261

20:57.303 --> 20:59.429
Is there any Linguini left?
