Anne?

30:45.157 --> 30:46.823

our checkpoint at Lake Moultrie.

30:48.927 --> 30:50.159

30:50.161 --> 30:51.994

31:36.082 --> 31:38.281
I would have gotten here sooner
if I could,

unexpectedly impenetrable.

31:42.252 --> 31:45.152
No, I mean the Volm.
Where the hell did you guys go?

31:45.154 --> 31:46.988
Did your father turn his back
on us?

31:46.990 --> 31:48.923
My father doesn't consider
you much at all

31:48.925 --> 31:50.624
when it comes to
larger Volm operations.

31:50.626 --> 31:54.360
Earth is not our only
battlefront with the Espheni.

31:54.362 --> 31:56.496
So, after all his talk
about liberating humans

31:56.498 --> 31:58.097
from the yolk of the Espheni,

31:58.099 --> 32:01.266
he just... up and abandoned
the whole deal, huh?

32:01.268 --> 32:03.134
Yes.
You are correct.

32:03.136 --> 32:04.468
We did abandon you,

32:04.470 --> 32:07.304
but the greater Volm force
had to go.

32:07.306 --> 32:11.108
And now I feel your pain
of displaced loved ones.

32:11.110 --> 32:13.042
What are you talking about?
Go? Where?

32:13.044 --> 32:15.544
My father redirected our fleet
to the Alicante 8 cluster.

32:15.546 --> 32:18.380
It is where we hid our
brood mates and hatchlings...

32:18.382 --> 32:20.548
Our family...
from the Espheni.

32:20.550 --> 32:22.549
Hoping they would
escape notice.

32:22.551 --> 32:24.317
They did not.

32:24.319 --> 32:28.554
We had to defend them
or risk extinction ourselves.

32:30.391 --> 32:34.158
We got about a minute before
that thing circles back around.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.627
And I've got
a million questions,

32:35.629 --> 32:37.561
starting with how the hell
do we get out of this mess?

32:37.563 --> 32:40.063
How many Volm are left on earth?
Is your father coming back?

32:40.065 --> 32:42.966
A handful of Volm units remain,

32:42.968 --> 32:45.368
scattered about the globe,
small recon teams.

32:46.569 --> 32:50.906
We believe the Espheni are
constructing a new power source,

32:50.908 --> 32:53.041
which would neutralize
any further attempt

32:53.043 --> 32:55.376
to liberate humanity
once and for all.

32:58.679 --> 33:01.081
What kind of power source?

33:01.083 --> 33:04.382
That is as much
as I can say for now.

33:04.384 --> 33:07.185
Otherwise,
we are not to engage the enemy

33:07.187 --> 33:08.586
under any circumstance.

33:08.588 --> 33:11.388
My squad is displeased

33:11.390 --> 33:14.257
that I have made this detour
from our patrol.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.993
They get nervous.
They'll get over it.

33:19.095 --> 33:22.564
I've got one more thing.

33:22.566 --> 33:26.534
Hal is in here with me,
but my sons, Matt and Ben,

33:26.536 --> 33:31.237
and my daughter, Lexi,
and Anne... are lost.

33:31.239 --> 33:35.075
I will look, but I can make
no guarantees I will find them.

33:35.077 --> 33:37.176
I know you can find them.

33:37.178 --> 33:38.377
You found me.

33:38.379 --> 33:41.079
One thing I have learned...

33:41.081 --> 33:45.216
These ghetto camps
are worldwide, Tom.

33:45.218 --> 33:47.684
We do not know
what the Espheni's new plans are

33:47.686 --> 33:49.685
for their human prisoners,

33:49.687 --> 33:55.257
but I'm afraid the human race
is facing extinction.

33:58.060 --> 34:01.195

you putting yourself at risk.

"wait. Wait."
