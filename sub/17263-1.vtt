01:31.140 --> 01:33.180
Amy?

01:33.220 --> 01:35.580
I know that's you. That's my jacket!

01:35.620 --> 01:37.860
You always do this.
It's like with that T-shirt.

01:37.900 --> 01:40.620
The black one with the star on it.
You gave it to me, remember?

01:40.660 --> 01:42.660
I don't know what you're saying.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.300
I said, you gave it to me.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.660
You're such a hypocrite.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.180
Why are you doing this?

01:48.220 --> 01:49.700
You tried to kill me. What?

01:49.740 --> 01:51.420
You wanted me to wear
a belt with my pyjamas,

01:51.460 --> 01:53.980
then you tried to strangle me
with it. It wasn't you.

01:54.020 --> 01:55.100
You're possessed.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.620
That's insane.

01:56.660 --> 01:58.500
Oh, God. You've lost it.

01:58.540 --> 02:00.740
We're going to perform an exorcism.
What?

02:00.780 --> 02:02.860
We're going to get this
thing out of you.

02:02.900 --> 02:05.180
Amy, please,
there's nothing inside me.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.460
You're my best friend.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.979
You've always been there for me.

02:10.020 --> 02:12.300
I'm not going to let some psycho
demon possess you.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.620
I love you.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.660
Oh! Are you gay?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.380
What?

02:18.420 --> 02:19.780
Are you... Are you gay?

02:19.820 --> 02:21.940
No.
OK. It's cool.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.020
Well, if you and your girlfriend
are done, we should get started.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.980
What we do?
OK, first step, you need to...

02:31.140 --> 02:32.300
piss on her.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.300
What? Huh? Are you serious?

02:34.340 --> 02:37.620
You need to mark her
with your scent like a lion.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.140
It doesn't actually say like a lion,

02:39.180 --> 02:40.980
I just thought it would be
a useful analogy.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.020
I'm not pissing on her.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.020
Well, then we might as well
forget the whole thing,

02:44.060 --> 02:46.100
because that is step one
right there. You piss on her!

02:46.140 --> 02:49.300
I... I had a really long wee
before we came out.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.340
The tank is dry.

02:50.380 --> 02:53.580
There's not even a dribble in there.

02:55.780 --> 02:57.300
This had better work.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.180
Please, no.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.860
What are you doing?

03:02.700 --> 03:06.700
I want my friend back,
you sick freak!

03:07.380 --> 03:11.380
Rhythm Of The Rain
by The Cascades

03:15.740 --> 03:19.740
How are we doing? Are you...?
Will you please shut up!

03:32.420 --> 03:35.180
You say I'm ready. How do you know?

03:35.220 --> 03:37.420
We've been gradually
reducing your dose

03:37.460 --> 03:38.980
and you've been doing fine.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.580
What if it starts again?
You mean the hallucinations?

03:41.620 --> 03:44.020
What if they come back?
Well, there's no reason they should.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.780
There's no evidence of any
ongoing condition.

03:46.820 --> 03:49.700
You might experience some side
effects as the body adjusts

03:49.740 --> 03:52.620
to the withdrawal.
Dizziness, headaches, diarrhoea...

03:52.660 --> 03:54.860
So I'm not crazy,
but I might shit myself.

03:54.900 --> 03:58.900
Hopefully not, but it happens.

04:27.780 --> 04:31.780
Hi.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.900
They're, erm... 2CVs.

04:55.940 --> 04:59.820
It's basically ecstasy,
acid and horse tranquilliser.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.220
You know, it's like two lovers.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.580
One moment, it'll whisper
in your ear

05:03.620 --> 05:05.780
all gentle and tender and then...

05:05.820 --> 05:07.500
Boom!

05:07.540 --> 05:10.420
Pounding you hard,
just the way you like it. What?

05:10.460 --> 05:14.460
Two lovers pounding you hard!

05:14.620 --> 05:15.820
The pill.

05:15.860 --> 05:18.620
Do you want to feel like you're
being nailed by a very trippy horse?

05:18.660 --> 05:21.300
No. Really?

05:21.340 --> 05:25.340
I think you're making
a huge mistake.

05:25.900 --> 05:27.020
Thought he was in Thailand.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.700
The bloke's such a pussy hound.

05:29.740 --> 05:32.180
It kills me to say it, but...

05:32.220 --> 05:34.780
that is sensational hair.

06:01.900 --> 06:05.380
Please don't have sex with
Matt Bishop. It's such a cliche.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.340
He's an emotional paraplegic.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.620
It's just something I've got to do.
It's like...

06:09.660 --> 06:10.900
a bungee jump.

06:10.940 --> 06:13.340
A bungee jump doesn't give
you herpes.

06:13.380 --> 06:17.220
Maybe you should start thinking
about who you're sleeping with.

06:17.260 --> 06:20.660
I'm not sleeping with anyone!

06:20.700 --> 06:22.540
Hi, Matt.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.820
I like your hair. Thanks.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.700
I've just had it cut.
I'm really happy with it.

06:26.740 --> 06:28.740
Wow. Was this in Thailand?

06:28.780 --> 06:31.420
No, they don't really have
haircuts in Thailand.

06:31.460 --> 06:35.460
Have you noticed how all Asian guys
basically have the same hair style?

06:35.580 --> 06:36.860
That's hilarious.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.900
No, it's not. It's racist.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.100
And it's not true. Gok Wan.

06:41.140 --> 06:43.100
Is that like a pad Thai? Yeah.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.180
No. Gok Wan, the stylist.

06:45.220 --> 06:48.700
The Asian guy on TV
with the big quiff.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.540
I'm going to go for a cigarette.

06:50.580 --> 06:54.580
Enjoy your bungee jump. Mm.

07:21.060 --> 07:25.060
Stand up, you silly bitch.

08:04.980 --> 08:08.980
Do you see me?

08:12.780 --> 08:15.020
No. Hey!

08:15.060 --> 08:16.220
Dickhead.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.700
Bitch.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.660
Yeah, that's right.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.180
You'd better run!

08:25.220 --> 08:29.100
Arsehole!

08:44.580 --> 08:47.200
Hey! What's going on?

09:01.160 --> 09:02.880
Amy?

09:02.920 --> 09:04.520
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.600
I'm Dr Waverly, Judy's psychiatrist.

09:06.640 --> 09:10.640
The consultant asked me to come
and talk to you. Bed or chair?

09:11.920 --> 09:15.320
Which one would you like to sit on?

09:15.360 --> 09:18.960
Bed? Excellent choice.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.840
May I?

09:20.880 --> 09:23.560
Hmm. Ouch, that looks painful.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.440
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

09:25.480 --> 09:28.360
It sounds ridiculous.
Amy, I want to help you.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.040
And I can only do that
if you tell me what happened.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.280
I see things.

09:35.320 --> 09:39.320
What do you see? People.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.680
Their faces.

09:41.720 --> 09:45.720
And what do they look like?
Horrible.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.160
Like they're burning inside.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.360
This has happened before, hasn't it?

09:50.400 --> 09:51.760
They came back.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.560
Well, this must be very
confusing for you. And...

09:55.600 --> 09:58.240
you've just come off
your medication.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.600
These hallucinations,

09:59.640 --> 10:02.400
they can be the result of
chemical changes in your brain.

10:02.440 --> 10:06.440
They feel so real.
Oh, I'm sure they do.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.000
I'm going to make an appointment
for you to come and see me

10:10.040 --> 10:12.280
and we can try and
figure this out together.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.720
How does that sound?

11:15.800 --> 11:19.160
Bam! I just knew you'd come back.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.000
You know what they say about
curiosity and cats and...

11:23.040 --> 11:25.080
getting killed? Who are you?

11:25.120 --> 11:27.200
I'm like you. Well, not physically.

11:27.240 --> 11:31.240
No, what I mean is the things
you see, I see them too.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.800
You're not crazy. You see them too?

11:34.840 --> 11:38.840
What are they? OK, er,
you ready for this?

11:39.520 --> 11:41.920
They're demons.
You're hilarious, really.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.280
Yeah, I know, it sounds like
so much bullshit, right?

11:44.320 --> 11:48.000
The trouble is there's a little
part of you that knows it's true,

11:48.040 --> 11:52.040
jabbing away at you like
a...woodpecker or amphetamine.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.240
What?! What?

11:57.280 --> 12:00.760
We're in the middle of
something here. Go round.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.360
Drive round, bitch! Oh, my days.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.360
God. Believe that? It's so rude.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.640
So, there you go. They're demons.

12:10.680 --> 12:13.360
That's insane.
It is definitely out there.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.400
Somewhere that I need to be. Do you
want to walk with me? We can talk?

12:17.880 --> 12:21.680
The guy from last night...
You're saying he's possessed.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.240
Where did he come from?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.560
Hell, the underworld,
whatever you want to call it.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.520
This is totally insane.
Stuff like this just doesn't happen.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.560
You know how sometimes people
just suddenly flip out?

12:32.640 --> 12:36.640
Go batshit crazy and slaughter their
entire families and all their pets?

12:37.240 --> 12:41.160
Well, it's because
they're possessed.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
What's up? What's up?!

12:43.240 --> 12:45.520
This might come as a shock
but I'm having some trouble

12:45.560 --> 12:46.840
getting my head around this.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.760
Well, you better get your pretty
little head around it, and quick.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.200
You're on their radar now.
What radar? What do you mean?

12:52.240 --> 12:53.560
We can expose them.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.520
Me and you, we make 'em
crap in their panties.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.800
They're scared of us?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.280
As long as they've been around,
people like us have been

12:59.320 --> 13:03.320
hunting them down and shoving
wooden poles up their arses.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.560
Big pole! Right up their arse.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.440
How come we can see them?
It's just how our brains are wired.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.960
There's only a few of us who can.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.520
Were you on medication? Niaxarol.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.720
How did you know?
That shit stops you seeing them.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.880
And it makes it harder
for you to orgasm.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.000
You know the seesaws
in the kids playground?

13:22.040 --> 13:25.800
Ever since I came off my meds,
they make me come really hard.

13:25.840 --> 13:29.480
The look on the kids' faces!
It's wrong.

13:29.520 --> 13:32.920
You ever slept with
a guy with cold semen? What?

13:32.960 --> 13:36.840
No, I don't think so.
It's not like I always check.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.720
If a guy's possessed, their
semen's cold. Major warning sign.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.720
If I'm taking the temperature of
his semen, it's probably too late.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.760
Right, right.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.640
I mean, who carries
a semen thermometer?

13:47.680 --> 13:51.680
Anyway, this is me, so...

13:52.560 --> 13:54.040
This is you?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.680
I hate to unload and run but
if I don't see my therapist,

13:56.720 --> 13:58.520
they'll section me.

13:58.560 --> 14:02.560
The prick from last night,
you want to help me hunt him down?

14:03.520 --> 14:07.520
A pole up the arse,
can of lighter fluid. Bshh!

14:07.640 --> 14:09.920
I have work.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.520
I have to work.
OK, another time. Definitely.

14:13.560 --> 14:17.560
I'll bring my arse pole.
Oh, yeah. You should.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.560
You should get up to speed, girl.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.840
This is happening.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.880
Wake up! Ow! What the fu...?

14:25.520 --> 14:29.320
I should have pinched your arm.
Next time.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.200
You don't believe me.
I was kind of going with it.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.880
The nipple-pinching and psychiatric
unit is giving me some doubts.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.720
You think I'm crazy?
They think you're crazy, apparently.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.760
If I'm crazy, you're crazy too.
You think I don't know that?

14:42.840 --> 14:46.840
You just need some time to
get your head round it. Yeah.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.840
We should go for cocktails.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.200
You like cocktails, right?

14:57.240 --> 15:00.640
Call me, any time, day or night.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.200
Not Tuesday evenings before nine
because I have Pilates.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.880
I could have just
put it in my phone.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.840
In my experience,
people lose their phones.

15:07.880 --> 15:09.240
Or they tell you they lose them.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.280
They don't want to call you because
you totally weird them out.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.320
I have to go.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.360
Hey, you're in?

15:45.400 --> 15:47.560
Didn't think you'd
come into work today.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.680
I'm broke, I need the money.

15:49.720 --> 15:53.720
Well, I was worried about you.
Come on.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.640
Bring it in, let's hug it out.
I'm fine, really.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.000
Jake? Jake? OK, yeah.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.960
OK, just checking.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
Some turd-burger's wedged
them all in here. You...

16:06.160 --> 16:08.360
going to have a scar? What?

16:08.400 --> 16:10.680
Trust me, girls with scars are hot.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.520
Who's that girl who went through
the windscreen of her dad's car?

16:13.560 --> 16:15.480
Emma Lawrence,
the girl in the wheelchair.

16:15.520 --> 16:18.440
Sure it isn't a skateboard? Pretty
sure. They're quite different.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.320
Girl I'm thinking of
rides a skateboard.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.560
You know what? She doesn't
have any scars either.

16:22.600 --> 16:25.000
So, it's just totally irrelevant?
No, it's something.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.400
I made you feel better.

16:26.440 --> 16:29.800
Get out there, you furry tit!
Come out!

16:31.480 --> 16:33.920
"Do you want to...go
for a drink later?"

16:33.960 --> 16:36.400
You are such a dick.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.440
I can't.
Rejections hurt his feelings.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.520
Hey? What's that, buddy?

16:43.560 --> 16:47.560
Oh, he says he likes tequila.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.920
And pussy.

16:49.960 --> 16:53.960
Dirty bastard.

16:58.840 --> 17:02.840
Raquel?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.760
Hey, I was calling you. I know.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.800
I was ignoring you.

17:10.119 --> 17:14.119
Can you tell me what's up?
What's going on?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.000
I met a girl today.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.280
That's great. Making friends,
look at you.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.440
Pinched her nipple.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.240
Right. This girl... Amy.

17:23.280 --> 17:25.960
..Amy, she didn't like her
nipple being pinched, then?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.920
I'm going with no.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.480
Don't know why I even try. She
thinks I'm a freak. Don't say that.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.520
You just need to give her
a chance to get to know you.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.720
And listen, if girls stopped liking
having their nipples pinched,

17:39.760 --> 17:43.760
then we are both in trouble
because that is my go-to move.

17:46.360 --> 17:50.360
Pizza's ready.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.640
Hey. Hey. I'm just leaving.

18:07.680 --> 18:11.680
Be outside, where you normally
pick me up. Yeah, I'll be about...

18:12.080 --> 18:14.080
ten minutes? You're a star.

18:14.120 --> 18:18.120
Bye.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.440
Bye, Amy!

18:51.840 --> 18:55.840
- Hello?
- Strike!

19:28.400 --> 19:32.400
You know we're closed, right?

19:38.320 --> 19:42.320
For fuck's sake!

20:06.520 --> 20:07.880
Hi.

20:07.920 --> 20:11.360
What do you want?
It's not about what I want.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.800
Just that I'd help.

20:12.840 --> 20:16.000
Why are you doing this?
You're a seer.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.440
I don't even know what that is.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.200
Oh, that sucks.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.240
But I'm going to kill you anyway.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.400
Strike!

20:34.240 --> 20:38.240
He wants you gone.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.320
Agh!

22:27.320 --> 22:31.320
Oh, God.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.000
Oh. Oh, my...

22:35.040 --> 22:39.040
Oh, God. Oh, God!

23:22.480 --> 23:24.240
Suzanne?

23:24.280 --> 23:26.640
Oh, my God, are you OK?

23:26.680 --> 23:30.440
Suzanne, are you hurt?
Say something.

23:30.480 --> 23:35.200
He just ran out in front of me.
I think he's dead.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.560
Hi, this is Raquel's phone,
leave a message after the tone.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.640
The possessed guy, he came after me.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.680
My friend ran him over
and he's dead.

24:26.840 --> 24:30.280
Where are you?

24:30.320 --> 24:33.080
Tuesdays, you're at parties.

24:33.120 --> 24:37.120
Um, call me.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.000
Are you OK? Maybe we should have
gone to the hospital.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.240
I'm fine.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.280
Honestly.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.680
What are you doing?

26:33.720 --> 26:37.480
Do you need a belt with those?

26:37.520 --> 26:40.280
A belt? With my pyjamas?

26:40.320 --> 26:44.320
Why would I want a belt
with my pyjamas? Don't be weird.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.280
What?

26:55.560 --> 26:59.560
See, you can wear
a belt with pyjamas.

27:46.440 --> 27:50.440
What's happening to me, Amy?
I'm scared.

27:51.480 --> 27:54.880
Why did I try and hurt you?
Why would I do that?

27:54.920 --> 27:56.840
This isn't you!

27:56.880 --> 28:00.080
What's happening to me?

28:00.120 --> 28:04.120
I don't know what to do,
I need your help.

28:05.840 --> 28:09.840
Amy, please...

28:10.000 --> 28:13.080
Open the door.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.120
Open the door.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.880
Open the door!

28:16.920 --> 28:20.920
Open the door, you little bitch!

28:33.120 --> 28:36.360
All right, I'm coming!

28:36.400 --> 28:38.680
Hey.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.680
Sorry, I just ran
all the way over here.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.520
Are those your pyjamas?

28:45.560 --> 28:48.280
Didn't even put any shoes on.
Well...

28:48.320 --> 28:49.720
It's OK, I get it.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.760
I know how it feels to be totally
consumed by lust and desire.

28:55.920 --> 28:59.240
Who needs shoes? Who needs feet?

28:59.280 --> 29:03.280
I... Shh, we have both waited
a long, long time for this.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.480
I just want to say that you
will not be disappointed.

29:12.640 --> 29:15.840
You might be the first few times.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.200
I locked myself out.

29:19.240 --> 29:23.200
I...just need somewhere to crash.

29:23.240 --> 29:27.240
No shoes...
No shoes, that's a green light.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.040
Are you saying that this
isn't a booty call?

29:32.080 --> 29:36.080
No. No.

29:37.920 --> 29:41.920
Come on in.

30:00.920 --> 30:04.920
Hi. Hi.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.160
Do you want to get a coffee?

30:07.200 --> 30:11.200
Oh, I don't drink coffee,
makes me shit, big-time.

30:12.120 --> 30:16.120
Can you drink tea? Tea's good.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.280
The guy in the bowling alley,
he called me a seer.

30:20.320 --> 30:22.720
It's what the pricks call us,
it's so lame.

30:22.760 --> 30:26.760
I prefer demon hunter
or kick-ass hell bitch.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.360
I did say you were on their radar.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.640
There's a new hell bitch
in town and they're shitting

30:31.680 --> 30:33.320
in their little demon panties.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.440
I'm not a hell bitch.
I work in a bowling alley.

30:36.480 --> 30:38.320
That's a good cover.
It's not a cover.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.840
It's how I pay my rent,
it's how I buy food.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.200
This demon, he's in Suzanne,
how's that even possible?

30:44.240 --> 30:46.840
If the body they're in dies,
they jump ship.

30:46.880 --> 30:48.400
How do I get him out of her?

30:48.440 --> 30:50.000
You have to perform an exorcism.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.280
What about Suzanne?

30:51.320 --> 30:54.800
Well, yeah, well, she should be OK.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.160
Will she be OK or not?

30:56.200 --> 30:59.920
Get it right, she should be fine,
touch wood.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.000
Oh, no, I think that is laminate.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.240
What does an exorcism involve?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.720
Stuff on the internet.
It's out there.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.760
If you know where to look.

31:13.400 --> 31:17.400
I'm sorry what I said about people
not calling you, just, you know.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.720
You thought I was all crazy.

31:22.760 --> 31:25.840
But now you're freaking out,
you suddenly need my help.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.240
I deserve better.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.960
I shouldn't have treated you
like that.

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
No, you shouldn't, because I am
a strong, a powerful black woman.

31:33.840 --> 31:37.840
Please?
I can't leave Suzanne like that.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.480
Pretty please with a cherry on top?

31:41.520 --> 31:44.480
You can have all the pleases
and the cherries you want, just...

31:44.520 --> 31:46.520
I can't do this without you.

31:46.560 --> 31:50.560
OK then. Let's exorcise the prick.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.760
Hi. Hi.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.280
Amy, this is my brother, Tyler.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.880
Hi.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.400
Can you two stop undressing
each other with your eyes?

32:04.440 --> 32:06.240
What? I wasn't.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.240
Hey, can I borrow your car?
Where you going?

32:08.280 --> 32:09.440
I was going to make lasagne.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.240
We're going to a nail bar,
because that's what girls do.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.640
He knows nothing about women.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.960
He used to call Mum's vagina
a foofoo.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.440
He's so embarrassing.
Can we have a word?

32:19.480 --> 32:23.480
In private?

32:28.800 --> 32:30.120
Foofoo, really?

32:30.160 --> 32:31.760
Mum said you were obsessed with it.

32:31.800 --> 32:32.920
No, I wasn't.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.960
Besides, Amy doesn't need to know.

32:38.200 --> 32:42.200
So, that's Amy.

32:43.600 --> 32:47.480
Is she seeing anyone?
Amy, do you have a boyfriend?

32:47.520 --> 32:48.960
For fuck's sake.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.920
Not really, no.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.720
Brilliant, nicely done.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.080
Thank you. Hm.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.280
The fan belt's slipping.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.680
Bye, Amy. Bye.

33:04.720 --> 33:08.720
It was nice to meet you.

33:21.720 --> 33:25.120
Just so you know,
I'm totally cool with it.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.560
Totally cool with what?

33:26.600 --> 33:29.440
With you having sex with my brother.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.480
I'm not going to have sex
with your brother.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.320
Oh. You are filthy.

33:34.360 --> 33:38.360
I'm not, I'm not filthy.
I'm clean, I'm very, very clean.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.520
What's that?

33:42.560 --> 33:46.560
Do I look like a mechanic to you?
Uhh-uh.

33:49.680 --> 33:53.680
Drag Me Down
by Weaves

34:43.080 --> 34:45.960
My mask makes my face
smell like balls.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.679
Rubbery balls. It's gross.

34:49.719 --> 34:52.679
Raquel.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.719
Oh! Raquel!

35:11.920 --> 35:14.200
Hello, Raquel.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.920
It's good to see you.

35:17.960 --> 35:21.960
Go, go!

35:35.020 --> 35:36.540
What the hell just happened?

35:36.580 --> 35:38.180
There's a whole gang of them
after us now.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.100
Did you think we would just
frighten one of them?

35:40.140 --> 35:42.060
Yeah. That's incredibly naive.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.340
Really, that is
a little embarrassing.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.500
Who was that guy?

35:45.540 --> 35:47.460
Who is he?

35:47.500 --> 35:48.540
Just a guy I know.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.380
He's possessed. He saved us.
Why would he do that?
Why would he do that?

35:51.420 --> 35:54.180
Like I said, some of them
are not all totally bad.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.140
You know you never
actually said that.

35:56.180 --> 35:57.260
Didn't I?

35:57.300 --> 35:59.860
Well, I have now. There it is.

35:59.900 --> 36:00.940
They're not all bad.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.580
What was that?

36:02.620 --> 36:03.860
He can make stuff fly.

36:03.900 --> 36:05.620
Some of them have powers, abilities.

36:05.660 --> 36:06.820
Did I not tell you that?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.140
No.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.260
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

36:10.300 --> 36:11.860
That's probably it for now.

36:11.900 --> 36:15.580
I'm sure other stuff
will come up as we go along.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.740
This...

36:16.780 --> 36:20.140
good guy demon,
you and him, you friends?

36:20.180 --> 36:21.420
No.

36:21.460 --> 36:23.460
We're not friends.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.020
Not even close.

36:45.620 --> 36:49.620
Shit.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.500
Amy.

36:55.540 --> 36:57.460
Just ignore him.

36:57.500 --> 37:01.500
Amy.

37:06.340 --> 37:08.340
Hey, I thought that was you.

37:08.380 --> 37:10.540
What's going on? Nothing.

37:10.580 --> 37:11.780
Just driving around.

37:13.460 --> 37:16.900
What's that? What?

37:16.940 --> 37:18.900
That sound.

37:18.940 --> 37:20.780
I don't hear anything.

37:20.820 --> 37:24.060
It's coming from the boot
of your friend's car.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.020
It's my dog.

37:26.060 --> 37:29.180
Poochy.

37:29.220 --> 37:33.220
Go.

37:34.460 --> 37:38.460
Jesus.

37:47.500 --> 37:51.260
Hey, isn't it a bit cruel keeping
your dog in the boot like that?

37:51.300 --> 37:53.060
He's a pit bull.

37:53.100 --> 37:57.100
Maybe I should let Poochy out
so he can rip your stupid face off

37:57.180 --> 37:59.180
and shit it out!

37:59.220 --> 38:03.220
Go!

38:05.900 --> 38:07.540
What the hell was that?

38:07.580 --> 38:10.300
Guys like that only
understand one thing -

38:10.340 --> 38:13.260
raw, naked aggression
and bald spots.

38:13.300 --> 38:16.220
That's two things, so...

38:16.260 --> 38:18.980
Just drive.

38:19.020 --> 38:21.580
Poochy.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.420
I gave you a simple task.

38:24.460 --> 38:27.940
Were my instructions
unclear or confusing?

38:27.980 --> 38:29.340
It was Sawyer.

38:29.380 --> 38:31.140
He came out of nowhere.

38:31.180 --> 38:34.020
Sawyer?

38:34.060 --> 38:36.900
You know,
that really pisses me off.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.140
I'm doing this for the
benefit of all of us

38:39.180 --> 38:41.380
and all he's thinking
about is himself.

38:41.420 --> 38:45.420
He's not seeing the bigger picture.

38:46.020 --> 38:48.620
I had to leave an
awards ceremony early.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.340
You see this?

38:50.380 --> 38:54.380
Outstanding Contribution
To Psychiatry.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.700
That's me.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.900
You should really get
that looked at.

38:59.940 --> 39:03.780
You're going to need full
facial reconstructive surgery.

39:03.820 --> 39:07.820
It's a few bruises.

39:15.740 --> 39:19.740
Like I said, full facial
reconstructive surgery.

39:20.980 --> 39:23.420
What do you want me
to do about Sawyer?

39:23.460 --> 39:25.340
Sawyer.

39:25.380 --> 39:29.220
Looks like we might have to bring
in a big gun to take him out.

39:29.260 --> 39:33.260
Self-centred little prick.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.500
She means a lot to you, doesn't she?

40:24.060 --> 40:26.220
My mum wasn't around much.

40:26.260 --> 40:30.260
Suzanne was always there for me
when everyone thought I was crazy.

40:31.780 --> 40:35.540
Other people wouldn't
hang out with us.

40:35.580 --> 40:39.580
Even when it cost her,
she was always there.

40:45.500 --> 40:49.500
Let's go get your friend back.

40:58.260 --> 40:59.980
Balls.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.180
Rubbery...

41:01.220 --> 41:04.380
balls.

41:45.860 --> 41:47.260
That's it, we're done.

41:47.300 --> 41:48.820
Why isn't anything happening?

41:48.860 --> 41:50.700
Sometimes it takes
a little while to kick in,

41:50.740 --> 41:52.300
like one of those
microwave popcorns.

41:52.340 --> 41:54.660
All that Latin stuff -
maybe you weren't saying it right.

41:54.700 --> 41:57.140
My Latin isn't perfect, I'm sorry.

41:57.180 --> 41:59.100
I don't know what half
this shit means.

41:59.140 --> 42:01.580
So for all we know, it could be
a recipe for chocolate brownies.

42:01.620 --> 42:05.620
It's not a recipe for brownies,
the Romans never even had brownies.

42:06.140 --> 42:08.122
I guess they had some
kind of chocolate cake.

42:08.202 --> 42:10.140
Why are we talking
about chocolate cake? Jesus.

42:12.860 --> 42:16.860
Your time's
coming, pig.

42:35.060 --> 42:36.740
What's coming?
What's she talking about?

42:36.780 --> 42:37.980
I don't know.

42:38.020 --> 42:39.420
I don't know.

42:39.460 --> 42:43.460
Suzanne?

42:49.820 --> 42:53.820
Suzanne?

43:09.500 --> 43:12.460
Suzy?

43:12.500 --> 43:13.980
S...

43:14.020 --> 43:15.900
Oh, Jesus.

43:15.940 --> 43:18.180
Oh, Jesus.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.620
Suzanne.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.220
No, no, no.

43:22.260 --> 43:26.260
Suzanne!

43:27.780 --> 43:31.780
She's dead.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.180
If we don't bury her,

43:37.220 --> 43:41.220
we're going to be eating prison
pussy for the rest of our lives.

43:47.980 --> 43:51.980
Gotcha.

43:57.940 --> 44:00.260
What in the name...

44:00.300 --> 44:03.460
of his holy fuckness...

44:03.500 --> 44:07.500
is going on?

44:08.305 --> 44:14.431
