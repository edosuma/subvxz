<i>between a man and a dog?</i>

20:58.340 --> 21:00.759
It's such a spe...
There's so many spectacular creatures

21:00.842 --> 21:02.177
-here on this great planet.
-Mm-hm.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.888
It's definitely very unique
'cause you're around that dog.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.308
He is your... your friend,
your partner, 24/7,

21:08.392 --> 21:10.435
and he... Whenever you go, he goes,

21:10.727 --> 21:14.064
and it's... it’s your bond that you create
that makes it something special

21:14.147 --> 21:16.692
and that dog turns
to 100 percent trust you,

21:17.234 --> 21:19.111
and basically show you
the same emotion back.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.947
-Isn’t that something?
-It is... it is fantastic.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.157
Jeez.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.828
<i>These beautiful, beautiful... beings,</i>

21:28.036 --> 21:31.873
<i>so much more than pets</i>
<i>that we bred and trained for utility.</i>

21:33.250 --> 21:35.752
<i>What we call heroism,</i>

21:35.919 --> 21:38.547
which is, you know, this...
The willingness to sacrifice

21:38.630 --> 21:40.966
your own interest
for the interest of another,

21:41.091 --> 21:43.802
and to contribute
to the well-being of others,

21:43.969 --> 21:46.096
well, they launch into that without...

21:47.139 --> 21:50.058
hesitation, and with full commitment,

21:50.350 --> 21:54.146
and with all their energy
and fierce eagerness,

21:54.354 --> 21:59.192
in a way that can only be,
in our concept, characterized as heroic.

<i>So, at the start of this whole exploration</i>
<i>into the world of dogs,</i>

22:05.782 --> 22:09.786
<i>I knew that, like a lot of you,</i>
<i>I think, I was a dog lover.</i>

22:10.495 --> 22:14.833
<i>But now, I’m just...</i>
<i>I think I’m in awe of dogs.</i>

22:15.917 --> 22:18.837
<i>And as to the question</i>
<i>why did we connect with dogs</i>

22:18.920 --> 22:20.380
<i>more than any other animal?</i>

22:20.881 --> 22:24.718
<i>You know, I... I... I think maybe</i>
<i>because dogs lead by example.</i>

22:25.427 --> 22:30.307
<i>They can teach us, I think,</i>
<i>if we’re open and humbly receptive,</i>

22:31.141 --> 22:33.352
<i>uh, how to be better human beings.</i>

22:35.312 --> 22:38.440
I'm just wondering now,
after myself spending time with dogs

22:38.523 --> 22:40.317
during this period and dog experts,

22:40.484 --> 22:43.236
should we be more like dogs?

22:44.654 --> 22:48.992
Well, yes.
I think the obvious answer is, yeah.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.079
<i>We could certainly be more present</i>

22:52.496 --> 22:56.750
and joyful and ready to help out

22:56.917 --> 23:01.338
and sacrifice ourselves heroically,
at the drop of a hat.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.466
Yeah, I’d like to be more like Woody.
