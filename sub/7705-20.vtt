00:02.336 --> 00:04.503
(Raquel)
'Don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you.'

00:04.505 --> 00:05.971
(Trevor)
'So stop talkin'!'

00:05.973 --> 00:07.840
'I don't want to talk
about it, Raquel.'

00:07.842 --> 00:10.142
(Raquel)
'Well, we're gonna
talk about it, Trevor!'

00:10.144 --> 00:12.644
(Trevor)
'You wanna talk
about it, talk about it!'

00:12.646 --> 00:14.380
'I'll be in the can!'

00:17.118 --> 00:19.852
(Raquel)
'Don't go in that bathroom
when I'm fighting with you!'

00:19.854 --> 00:21.820
'Don't you go
in that bathroom!'

00:21.822 --> 00:23.889
[door slams]

00:23.891 --> 00:26.325
(Raquel)
'Okay, then I'm going
in the bedroom!'

00:26.327 --> 00:28.494
[door slams]

00:28.496 --> 00:30.396
I'll give her
half a point.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.800
Hey, pull up
a chair, Willie.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.335
You're missing
a good one.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.736
What are you doing?

00:37.738 --> 00:40.005
Watching the Ochmoneks fight.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.707
Trevor's ahead on points.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.643
ALF, you're not supposed
to watch people

00:44.645 --> 00:47.713
through their windows,
find something else to do.

00:47.715 --> 00:50.082
Willie, there's
a power blackout.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.550
There's no TV.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.352
No video games.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.754
I can't play
blink the lights.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.924
We're all suffering, ALF.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.559
Why don't you..
Why don't you go out

01:00.561 --> 01:02.394
in the backyard and play?

01:02.396 --> 01:03.729
In this heat?

01:03.731 --> 01:06.165
You could fry a cat
on the sidewalk.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.901
Well, I could.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.539
Say, why are you
wearing my t-shirt?

01:13.541 --> 01:16.542
This is what people
wear when they swelter.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.877
I saw it in "Streetcar."

01:18.879 --> 01:21.880
I don't like you
taking my clothes

01:21.882 --> 01:25.017
and I don't like you
using my opera glasses

01:25.019 --> 01:27.586
to spy on the neighbors.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.955
Boy, you get irritable
when it's hot.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.191
Remind me to never
take you to Mercury.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.525
Deal!

01:35.029 --> 01:36.995
[saxophone music]

01:38.532 --> 01:41.500
Hey, would you
knock off the sax?

01:43.237 --> 01:46.472
[theme music]

02:16.270 --> 02:19.505
[music continues]

02:46.100 --> 02:47.766
[instrumental music]

02:49.136 --> 02:54.039
Hey, Willie, write out
a check for $6000.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.374
Alright, but, uh

02:55.376 --> 02:57.342
don't cash it till tomorrow.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.977
It's not for me.

02:58.979 --> 03:02.614
I'm ordering a battery-powered
home entertainment center.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.050
I wanna be ready
for the next blackout.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.986
No checks.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.890
Alright, but it's a bad idea
to send cash through the mail.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.526
Lynnie, I've got
ALF's plate.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.827
Will you carry
everything else?

03:15.829 --> 03:16.995
Yeah.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.665
Uh, nice, solid portion, Alf.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.633
- It's his new diet.
- Yeah.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.302
You can eat
as much as you want

03:23.304 --> 03:24.970
of whatever you want.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.838
And you lose
weight that way?

03:26.840 --> 03:27.940
You do?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.077
- Oh, not another blackout.
- Oh.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.012
(Lynn)
I guess we'll have
to reset the clocks again.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.481
(Kate)
Let's not, let's just
live a few minutes

03:36.483 --> 03:38.584
behind everyone else.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.520
[burps]

03:41.522 --> 03:43.322
So, what's for dessert?

03:44.425 --> 03:46.425
You're finished already?

03:46.427 --> 03:49.194
What do you do, inhale it?

03:49.196 --> 03:51.730
He-he ate mine, too.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.732
[doorbell ringing]

03:53.734 --> 03:55.367
Get that, will you, Brian?

03:55.369 --> 03:56.702
No way!

03:56.704 --> 03:59.404
- I'll get it.
- Pass me the corn.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.506
ALF, go, in the kitchen.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.208
I just got comfortable.

04:03.210 --> 04:06.044
Tell whoever it is
to go into the kitchen.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.779
Just go.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.748
Carry me.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.751
ALF.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.853
Alright, alright.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.122
Don't anyone eat my corn.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.323
Go!

04:20.527 --> 04:22.527
[mouthing]

04:22.529 --> 04:24.563
- Hi, Mr. Ochmonek.
- Hi, Trevor.

04:24.565 --> 04:27.232
- What is it with women, anyway?
- Beats me.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.801
You're a woman.
Maybe you'd know.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.937
Well, uh, let's see--

04:31.939 --> 04:33.639
You can't please 'em!

04:33.641 --> 04:35.974
I bring Raquel flowers.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.076
I talk to her
once in a while.

04:38.078 --> 04:40.579
You think that
makes her happy?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.447
Apparently not.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.749
You're a good kid.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.983
Take my advice.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.152
Don't get involved
with women.

04:47.154 --> 04:48.620
Take up swimming.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.789
I get ear infections.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.824
Where was I?

04:52.826 --> 04:55.027
You were putting down
all women everywhere.

04:56.163 --> 04:57.763
Right, thanks.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.265
Nothing I do is good
enough for Raquel anymore.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.934
So I'm not
Gary "Mr. Perfect" Collins.

05:02.936 --> 05:06.305
Hey, she's no
Mary Ann Mobley.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.173
Anybody eating this corn?

05:09.810 --> 05:11.209
I guess you are.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.612
[doorbell rings]

05:13.614 --> 05:15.914
If that's Raquel,
I'm not here.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.686
Hi, Mrs. Ochmonek.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.087
There you are.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.990
Leave me alone, I'm eating.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.959
I want you to come
home with me now, please.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.028
Why, so you can
yell at me some more?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.597
I don't think we should be
airing our dirty laundry

05:32.599 --> 05:33.832
in front of the neighbors.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.601
Hey, they know we fight.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.603
They watch us
through the windows.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.971
No, no, we don't.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.973
No one, in this room

05:41.975 --> 05:44.643
watches you through
your windows.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.144
Really?

05:46.146 --> 05:49.481
I always feel someone's
watching from this place.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.650
Oh, it's probably our..

05:51.652 --> 05:53.352
...poltergeist.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.887
Trevor, are you
coming home or not?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.656
Not!

05:57.658 --> 05:59.958
Uh, Trevor, m-maybe it
would be better

05:59.960 --> 06:02.694
if you did go home
and you know

06:02.696 --> 06:05.030
uh, kind of talked
this thing out.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.232
You could take
the corn with you.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.368
Yeah, you're right.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.336
She's going to
yell at me, anyway.

06:11.338 --> 06:14.740
I might as well be somewhere
I can take my pants off.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.876
I'm sorry about this.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.184
Well, that was fun.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.221
You really should have
them over more often.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.391
ALF, did you hear
what Trevor said?

06:32.393 --> 06:34.359
Who took my corn?

06:34.361 --> 06:38.397
He said he knows that someone's
watching them from this house.

06:38.399 --> 06:41.733
Okay, I'll try not
to do it anymore.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.435
Where's my corn?

06:45.038 --> 06:47.939
[instrumental music]

06:49.042 --> 06:51.276
- 'Night, Alf.
- 'Night.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.377
What're you doing?

06:52.379 --> 06:53.845
Speed-reading this book.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.714
Really?
What's it about?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.883
I have no idea..

06:57.885 --> 06:59.885
...but the fur
on my finger's gone.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.887
(Raquel)
'You're like a little kid
when it comes to money.'

07:01.889 --> 07:03.722
'We should put you
on an allowance.'

07:03.724 --> 07:06.625
(Trevor)
'Hey, I'm the one that earns
the money in this family.'

07:06.627 --> 07:08.894
Looks like the Ochmoneks
are at it again.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.762
Lynn, it's not polite
to listen in on

07:10.764 --> 07:13.765
other people's conversations.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.701
Right. What was I thinking?

07:16.703 --> 07:18.470
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.071
- 'Night.
- 'Night.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.706
(Raquel)
'My mother warned me,
she said'

07:21.708 --> 07:24.309
'"Don't marry a man who doesn't
have a job, and who gambles."'

07:24.311 --> 07:26.077
(Trevor)
'Ah, put a cork in it, Raquel!'

07:26.079 --> 07:27.813
(Raquel)
'Don't tell me what to do!'

07:27.815 --> 07:29.247
(Trevor)
'I'm warning you, Raquel.'

07:29.249 --> 07:30.749
'I've had it up to here
with your nagging.'

07:30.751 --> 07:33.585
'Now shut up! You're waking
the whole neighborhood!'

07:33.587 --> 07:35.587
(Raquel)
'I won't shut up,
I want everyone'

07:35.589 --> 07:37.255
'to know the kind of man
I married.'

07:37.257 --> 07:39.624
(Trevor)
'Well, I don't.
I'm shutting the window.'

07:39.626 --> 07:41.059
[window shuts]

07:45.098 --> 07:47.833
How can I read
with all this quiet?

07:51.505 --> 07:52.871
Ah!

07:54.575 --> 07:55.941
(ALF)
'Call the police!'

07:55.943 --> 07:57.943
Call the police!
Call the police!

07:57.945 --> 07:59.311
Horrible! Horrible!

07:59.313 --> 08:02.113
Worse than
"Friday the 13th, Part II."

08:02.115 --> 08:04.816
Worse than
"Friday the 13th, Part III!"

08:04.818 --> 08:06.618
ALF, what's going on?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.053
Don't ask.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.956
What are you talking about?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.791
I'm talking about murder.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.626
I'm talking about mayhem.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.761
I'm talking about foul play.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.431
ALF, get to the point.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.466
- Or go back to sleep.
- Alright.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.637
I just saw Mr. Ochmonek
<i> kill</i> Mrs. Ochmonek.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.472
- Ah.
- Oh, come on!

08:27.474 --> 08:29.474
I'm serious!

08:29.476 --> 08:30.942
I heard them fight.

08:30.944 --> 08:35.146
Then I saw Mr. Ochmonek
pick up an ice pick.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.182
Maybe you
misinterpreted things.

08:37.184 --> 08:41.286
Oh, right. Maybe they were
playing ice pick bingo.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.123
ALF, you're always doing..

08:45.125 --> 08:46.858
Do you remember when you
thought Mr. Litwak

08:46.860 --> 08:49.327
was building an atomic
bomb in his basement?

08:49.329 --> 08:51.196
It<i> was</i> an atomic bomb.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.632
It was a pool heater.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.734
Ha! They don't
even own a pool.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.502
Yes, they do.

08:57.504 --> 09:00.472
They do?
Can we go over?

09:02.009 --> 09:05.377
Look, it's hot tonight.
You're tired.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.845
You're having
a hard time

09:06.847 --> 09:09.848
distinguishing fantasy
from reality.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.816
So you're saying I'm crazy?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.351
I'm saying your mind

09:13.353 --> 09:15.720
may have been playing
tricks on you.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.689
Fine, don't believe me.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.492
They didn't believe
"The Boy Who Cried Wolf."

09:20.494 --> 09:24.195
"The Boy Who
Cried Wolf"...lied!

09:24.197 --> 09:25.564
He did?

09:25.566 --> 09:28.133
I've got to stop
speed-reading books.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.603
ALF, go, go to bed.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.573
Tomorrow morning you'll realize
how silly this whole thing is.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.241
I'll never rest.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.611
Not until that
murderer's behind bars.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.249
Alright, maybe I'll take a nap

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
but I won't enjoy it.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.424
We've got...to get him a hobby.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.694
[instrumental music]

09:57.397 --> 09:59.197
[snoring]

10:20.754 --> 10:22.287
Aah!

10:25.258 --> 10:28.159
Oh, it was only a dream.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.762
I've got to stop
eating Styrofoam

10:30.764 --> 10:32.530
before I go to bed.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.803
A-a-ah!
Aah! Aah!

10:38.805 --> 10:42.240
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

10:42.242 --> 10:45.076
ALF!
ALF, are you alright?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.312
- W-what happened?
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

10:47.314 --> 10:50.649
- ALF!
- Hey, watch the shoulders.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.485
I've got bursitis.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.987
ALF, what were
you screaming about?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.989
It was horrible!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.791
Trevor was after me.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.293
I don't see
Mr. Ochmonek.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.929
Well, he was here
a minute ago.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.531
Check behind
the refrigerator.

11:06.533 --> 11:10.201
Brian, ALF was just
having a nightmare.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.604
That is exactly what
happens to people

11:12.606 --> 11:15.440
who stare into other
people's windows.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.676
Isn't he wonderful?

11:17.678 --> 11:20.845
The guy can turn anything
into an object lesson.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.182
Well, would you like us to stay
with you for a little while?

11:24.184 --> 11:25.850
Yes, please.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.218
Forever.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.155
[sighing]
Come on, Brian.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.824
ALF, try to get
some sleep.

11:32.826 --> 11:36.027
I can't.
I'm too wound up.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.164
I've been through a trauma.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.200
Would it be alright if the rest
of us got some sleep?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.735
Sure, Willie.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.538
We wouldn't want you
to be cranky tomorrow.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.374
Come on, Lynnie.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.509
Let's go to bed.
Goodnight, ALF.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.746
- 'Night, ALF.
- 'Goodnight, ALF.'

11:59.753 --> 12:03.321
Okay, don't fall asleep.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.857
Don't fall asleep.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.493
Don't fall asleep.

12:08.495 --> 12:09.594
[metal clanking]

12:10.597 --> 12:11.763
Ignore that.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.732
Ignore that.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.101
[metal clanking]

12:16.870 --> 12:18.103
Oh, heck.

12:18.105 --> 12:21.439
Why must I be
so darn curious?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.784
[dramatic music]

12:34.221 --> 12:38.423
Alas, poor Mrs. Ochmonek.
I knew her well.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.293
[instrumental music]

12:45.398 --> 12:46.731
[imitating British accent]
Oh, hello.

12:46.733 --> 12:49.901
Is this Mr. Ochmonek
I'm speaking to?

12:49.903 --> 12:51.436
Oh, jolly good.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.905
I'm doing a survey for the BBC

12:53.907 --> 12:57.876
and I wonder if you'd like to
answer some questions?

12:57.878 --> 13:00.378
Super!
Uh, first off..

13:00.380 --> 13:02.580
What would you say is the
difference between

13:02.582 --> 13:05.817
American and British
television?

13:06.987 --> 13:08.653
Uh-huh.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.221
Mm-hmm.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.257
Fine, and thank you,
Mr. Ochmonek.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.926
Question number two.
Did you kill your wife?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.761
- ALF!
- Oh, gotta go.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.329
The Queen just dropped by.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.399
What were you doing?

13:21.401 --> 13:22.834
- Just some impressions.
- 'Oh.'

13:22.836 --> 13:25.003
Hey, you wanna see
my Sammy Davis Jr.?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.605
[imitating Sammy Davis Jr.]
You know, this dude, man,
and I mean that.

13:27.607 --> 13:31.276
- She is--
- You were harassing Trevor.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.445
Kate, I saw the man
bury his wife

13:34.447 --> 13:36.848
in the backyard last night.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.116
Look, don't you remember?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.318
You were dreaming.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.687
No, this was real!

13:42.689 --> 13:46.357
Look, I took
these pictures.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.093
These are all black.

13:49.095 --> 13:51.496
You wanted me
to use a flash?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.431
The guy's a murderer.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.500
Trevor is not a murderer.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.302
Murderer's do not commit crimes

13:57.304 --> 14:00.138
in front of windows
with the shades pulled up.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.940
Yes, they do.

14:01.942 --> 14:06.311
Leopold and Loeb used to leave
their shade up all the time..

14:06.313 --> 14:08.146
...and their door open!

14:08.148 --> 14:10.215
Anybody could've walked in.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.318
Oh, please, please.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.221
Just give your
imagination a rest.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.691
Justice never rests.

14:19.693 --> 14:23.261
What if I gave justice
a cookie?

14:24.130 --> 14:26.464
Justice will think about it.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.474
[instrumental music]

14:43.884 --> 14:44.916
Oh, no!

14:48.521 --> 14:49.721
ALF.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.788
ALF!

14:59.866 --> 15:01.766
Oh, no.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.836
Trevor, don't.

15:04.838 --> 15:06.804
Don't go into the den.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.910
(Willie)
'Oh, Trevor, pick up the phone.
Pick up the phone.'

15:13.380 --> 15:14.846
[ringing stops]

15:14.848 --> 15:16.481
Ochmonek residence.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.884
ALF, why are you answering?

15:19.886 --> 15:21.319
It was ringing!

15:22.389 --> 15:23.721
You've got to
get out of there!

15:23.723 --> 15:25.223
Who is this?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.692
It's me!
It's Willie!

15:27.694 --> 15:29.794
Oh, hi, Willie.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.030
Hey, I can see you
through the window.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.235
ALF, Trevor is in
the next room. Get out!

15:37.237 --> 15:39.804
Right. Bye.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.310
Oh, Trevor.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.883
Pick up the phone, please.

15:51.885 --> 15:52.850
[phone rings]

15:55.055 --> 15:57.322
[phone ringing]

16:00.060 --> 16:01.759
Hello.

16:01.761 --> 16:02.994
Oh, hi.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.163
Tanner?

16:05.165 --> 16:06.798
(Willie)
'Yeah, hi.'

16:06.800 --> 16:09.100
Hey, did you call
just a minute ago?

16:09.102 --> 16:10.501
No!

16:11.805 --> 16:14.272
I mean, no.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.442
Oh, that must
have been the BBC.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.843
(Willie)
The BBC?

16:18.845 --> 16:21.279
- No!
- Yeah.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.983
Hey, you want to know why their
shows are better than ours?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.585
Because they respect
their audiences.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.454
Yeah, I'll give you
an example.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.756
Last week on the
"Benny Hill Show"

16:31.758 --> 16:34.258
Benny meets this guy
wearing high heels.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.928
Ah, w-well, Benny's
not wearing the high heels.

16:36.930 --> 16:38.296
The other guy is.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.931
Benny's wearing
a dress, of course.

16:39.933 --> 16:42.700
'So then, when they meet
they're walking down a street..'

16:44.170 --> 16:45.970
(Willie)
'Okay, where is he?'

16:45.972 --> 16:49.374
If you're talking about me,
I'm in here.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.777
Honey, what is the matter?

16:52.779 --> 16:55.613
Him!
He's what's the matter! Him!

16:57.217 --> 16:58.783
He just broke in
the Ochmonek's house.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.184
- 'Ah.'
- He went through the drawers.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.386
I didn't break in.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.988
I used a crowbar.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.325
ALF, didn't I tell you
not to bother Trevor anymore?

17:07.327 --> 17:09.861
Yeah. How does this sound?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.797
Ladies and gentlemen,
of the jury..

17:13.633 --> 17:15.400
That's all I've got so far.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.803
This is the last straw!

17:18.805 --> 17:21.439
Oh, you say that
all the time.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.508
This time is--

17:23.510 --> 17:25.309
Look, Willie, you're upset.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.811
I understand that.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.480
But before you
pop a blood vessel

17:29.482 --> 17:31.916
let me show you something.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.786
Exhibit A.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.022
Chattering teeth?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.657
These don't chatter.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.093
They belong to Mrs. Ochmonek.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.096
This was her laugh.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.032
Oh, great, now we know

17:48.034 --> 17:49.367
you didn't break
in there for nothing.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.768
Now, we know you're a thief.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.071
This proves she was murdered.

17:53.073 --> 17:55.440
People don't pull
their teeth and gums out

17:55.442 --> 17:57.508
while they're alive.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.446
ALF, uh..

18:01.448 --> 18:03.881
Those are false teeth.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.517
No kidding?
Well, let me try them.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.453
Give me the teeth!

18:08.455 --> 18:09.754
I'm returning these.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.224
And if you ever,<i> ever!</i>

18:13.226 --> 18:15.126
Do you understand?

18:17.464 --> 18:19.931
See the look he gave me?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.900
ALF, why do you
do these things?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.636
- I'm a concerned citizen.
- Oh.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.406
First they came
for the communists..

18:28.408 --> 18:31.042
...but I didn't
speak up because..

18:31.044 --> 18:32.710
...I wasn't a communist.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.479
Then they came
for the Jesuits--

18:34.481 --> 18:36.280
We get the point.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.749
Mom, don't you think
it's strange that Mrs. Ochmonek

18:38.751 --> 18:41.085
would leave the house
without her teeth?

18:41.087 --> 18:43.654
Maybe she was meeting
someone for soup.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.090
Never mind.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.759
Maybe we shouldn't have
let dad go over there.

18:48.761 --> 18:49.727
Yeah.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.596
Trevor might
decide to become

18:51.598 --> 18:53.664
a<i> serial</i> killer.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.700
They get a lot
more publicity.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.803
Mom, what if ALF is right?

18:58.805 --> 19:00.471
ALF, do you see
what you are doing here?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.473
You're making
everybody crazy!

19:02.475 --> 19:03.841
Honey, Trevor can't
be a murderer.

19:03.843 --> 19:07.011
We have known
that man for, for years.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.515
Oh! Oh, no!

19:10.517 --> 19:12.083
What? What?

19:12.085 --> 19:15.153
- 'What?'
- Oh, he's got his ice pick.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.855
Oh, he's-he's walking
towards Willie!

19:17.857 --> 19:20.124
I knew it!
Call the police!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.859
- Oh!
- Oh!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.027
Oh, no!

19:23.029 --> 19:26.130
Honey, go, go into Brian's room.
You stay with him.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.732
I'm going over there.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.870
Okay, I'll call the police.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.439
Where's the phone?

19:35.441 --> 19:36.641
Oh, here it is.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.143
Aah! That's the coffee pot!

19:39.145 --> 19:40.278
Aah!

19:42.348 --> 19:44.382
Willie, are you alright?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.584
- Willie!
- What's the matter?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.921
[Kate panting]

19:50.857 --> 19:52.557
Hi.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.392
What's that all about?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.661
Oh, well..

19:56.663 --> 20:00.198
Well, the lights
went out and, um..

20:00.200 --> 20:02.700
Willie's afraid of the dark.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.204
So, I thought I'd see
if he was okay.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.505
Are you okay?

20:07.507 --> 20:10.474
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, he's fine.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.676
You're afraid
of the dark?

20:11.678 --> 20:13.211
[chuckling]

20:13.213 --> 20:17.515
Yeah, it's not really
something I like to talk about.

20:17.517 --> 20:21.018
Trevor, um,
could I ask you..

20:21.020 --> 20:24.088
What are you doing...
with that ice pick?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.623
Chopping ice.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.925
[sighs]

20:28.528 --> 20:30.194
I see.

20:30.196 --> 20:33.531
Uh, listen, I didn't really know
how to bring this up, uh, Trevor

20:33.533 --> 20:37.935
but, um, are these...yours?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.238
No.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.707
They look like Raquel's.
Where'd you find them?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.075
Oh, outside.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.943
Oh, I wonder how
they got there?

20:45.945 --> 20:48.546
Well, they probably
fell out of..

20:48.548 --> 20:49.914
...her mouth.

20:51.551 --> 20:54.185
Well, thanks for being honest
enough to bring them back.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.720
No problem.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.222
Well, you know, w-we really
should be going now.

20:58.224 --> 21:01.525
Uh, Willie, Lynn is probably
worried about us.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.960
Um..

21:02.962 --> 21:04.729
She always
worries about us.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.565
Yeah. I gotta get back
to cleaning the bathroom.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.667
There's blood
all over the place.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.636
What?

21:12.438 --> 21:14.605
Willie, let's go.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.941
Excuse me,
is one of you--

21:16.943 --> 21:19.076
T-that's him.
He killed her.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.612
What? What's she
talkin' about?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.914
She's just jokin',
I-I mean, I don't think

21:23.916 --> 21:26.384
we should be making
these accusations.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.720
Look, uh, some guy named
Willie Tanner called.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.756
Said you buried your wife
in the backyard.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.258
Why does ALF
always use my name?

21:34.260 --> 21:37.395
Hey, Tanner,
why'd you say that?

21:37.397 --> 21:39.096
You know why.

21:39.098 --> 21:43.134
You...were seen digging
a hole last night.

21:43.136 --> 21:47.271
Digging..
Ah, that wasn't Raquel I buried.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.006
That was a side of beef.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.610
You expect us to believe that?

21:52.612 --> 21:53.844
Yeah.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.113
I paid a guy
100 bucks for it.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.015
It was heisted
off the back of a..

21:58.851 --> 22:00.651
I won it in a raffle..

22:00.653 --> 22:02.253
A meat raffle.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.689
Alright. Alright.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.792
Then, why is there
blood in the bathroom?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.760
From the side of beef.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.128
I was cutting it
up in the tub

22:11.130 --> 22:13.364
so I could fit it
in the fridge.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.900
Anymore questions?

22:17.603 --> 22:19.870
I don't think so.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.540
Can I ask you
where your wife is?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.475
She's at her sister's.

22:24.477 --> 22:27.311
The meat went bad
and stunk up the house.

22:27.313 --> 22:30.981
Raquel said she wouldn't
come back until I dumped it.

22:30.983 --> 22:34.285
Trevor, Trevor,
I'm so sorry.

22:35.555 --> 22:38.322
How could you think
I'd do something like that?

22:38.324 --> 22:42.493
Sometimes our imaginations
just get the best of us.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.162
Trevor, we're really sorry.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.530
Ah, forget it.

22:46.532 --> 22:50.000
Raquel and I used to think
you two were moonies.

22:50.002 --> 22:51.402
So we're no better.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.005
- Not again.
- Nobody panic.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.907
(Trevor)
Yeah, Tanner, don't freak out.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.510
Listen, officer, while
you're in the neighborhood

22:59.512 --> 23:02.179
there's a guy named
Litwak down the block.

23:02.181 --> 23:05.182
I think he's building
an a-bomb in the basement.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.251
(male #1)
Now I'll get right on it.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.021
- Did you see something?
- No.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.958
(Trevor)
Well, I did.
What the hell was that?

23:15.027 --> 23:17.461
What are you doing
with my teeth?

23:19.365 --> 23:21.499
You gotta be more careful
when you talk.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.839
ALF.

23:29.509 --> 23:30.574
Oh, hi, Lynn.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.610
What are you doing?

23:32.612 --> 23:34.378
This isn't what
it looks like.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.881
You mean, you're not
watching the Ochmoneks?

23:36.883 --> 23:39.383
Alright, it is
what it looks like.

23:39.385 --> 23:42.119
Look, you promised mom and dad
you wouldn't do that anymore.

23:42.121 --> 23:44.255
I know, but I have
a good reason.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.257
I'm waiting for them
to go to sleep

23:46.259 --> 23:49.160
so I can dig up the
meat in their yard.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.729
I'm going to bed.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.597
Do we have any Beaujolais?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.899
Goodnight, ALF.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.400
Sweet dreams.
