00:08.049 --> 00:09.802
<i>Previously on "You Me Her"...</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.053
I love us.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.473
Not just the sex, but, like, us.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.726
I know that you guys feel this just as much as I do.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.646
We have careers. We have neighbors.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.690
We're trying to have a baby, for God's sake.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.941
So, you're afraid?

00:23.983 --> 00:25.317
Of course we're fucking afraid.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.987
You don't deserve me.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.867
Do I really have to ask?

00:32.908 --> 00:35.995
I fucked Andy, and I got to go.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.371
Izzy: I'm gonna go home.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.915
You are home.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.584
No, like<i> home</i> home,

00:42.626 --> 00:43.961
as in Colorado.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.713
I've been working crazy hours

00:45.754 --> 00:47.756
on this huge pitch for a fancy new theater

00:47.798 --> 00:49.341
at the Hamilton School where Jack works.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.552
-Very well done, Mrs. Trakarsky. -Thank you.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.637
It won't be official until the Alumni Board approves it.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.724
Weinstock is retiring as dean,

00:56.765 --> 00:58.642
and he's recommending me as his replacement.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.435
The Alumni Board has all your records.

01:00.477 --> 01:01.896
They meet to discuss on Monday.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.856
Can they really track my browser history?

01:03.898 --> 01:06.400
This whole "niece that fell from the sky" issue

01:06.441 --> 01:08.402
continues to bother me.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.112
You find Jacqueline Isabelle's last name

01:11.154 --> 01:13.407
and any social-networking site

01:13.448 --> 01:14.950
that proves her and Jack's big sister

01:14.992 --> 01:16.535
could pick each other out of a line-up,

01:16.577 --> 01:17.912
let alone share DNA.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.329
I thought this was supposed to be easy.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.206
Yeah, whatever happened to click, bang?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.917
I'm not exactly a Photoshop wizard.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.668
It's Ava.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.794
It worked.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.424
It's about the position.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.967
We need to have a talk.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.429
Andy:

01:35.470 --> 01:37.138
So what about the position?

01:37.180 --> 01:40.267
Your browsing history made us all feel sad and dirty.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.519
No, no, no. That's -- I think that's --

01:42.561 --> 01:44.021
There's a million reasons for that, I think.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.313
You know, my, like, my --

01:45.355 --> 01:46.607
my nephew once was watching, like,

01:46.648 --> 01:48.149
"Dora the Explorer" on YouTube

01:48.191 --> 01:50.027
and the next thing you know, he was actually watching,

01:50.069 --> 01:51.528
like, a porn that was called "Dora the Explorer."

01:51.570 --> 01:53.697
So it's very easy to go from point A to point B.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.990
I think there's, like, those pop-up ads

01:55.032 --> 01:56.283
that they have that just --

01:56.324 --> 01:57.451
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.286
-I am. -Oh, my God.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.456
We need to talk about you being named dean today.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.124
Meaning it's happening.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.628
She'll probably make partner.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.629
Oh, my God.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.964
That -- that is great.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.673
That's -- That's unbelievable.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.050
Get a huge raise.

02:13.092 --> 02:14.718
Lots of money coming in.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.720
So...

02:16.762 --> 02:18.055
So, what?

02:18.097 --> 02:19.347
I mean, what

02:19.389 --> 02:21.475
Just spit it out. -Look, look.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.226
This isn't the first time in the past week

02:23.268 --> 02:24.436
that you've showed up looking like

02:24.478 --> 02:26.313
microwaved bison shit, Jack.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.731
Okay. Can you fast-forward to the part

02:27.773 --> 02:30.442
where you actually say what you're thinking?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.819
I'm thinking about the guy

02:31.860 --> 02:34.195
that I hired as a counselor 15 years ago.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.490
I asked you why you wanted the job,

02:36.531 --> 02:38.450
and you gave me the best no-bullshit answer

02:38.492 --> 02:39.994
I've ever heard.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.787
And -- And keep in mind

02:41.829 --> 02:44.123
that I've faced down thousands upon thousands of teenagers

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
and nobody can bullshit like a teenager.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.167
Oh, God, Jack.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.293
I'm so fucking sick of teenagers.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.628
Can you get to the part --

02:49.670 --> 02:51.005
what

02:51.046 --> 02:52.255
What was the line?

02:52.297 --> 02:53.966
You said, "All I really want to do

02:54.008 --> 02:55.926
is help as many kids as I can

02:55.968 --> 02:59.096
make it safely and sanely

02:59.138 --> 03:01.015
to the other side of 18."

03:01.056 --> 03:03.142
I remember that.

03:03.182 --> 03:07.729
That's not what I do as dean, Jack.

03:07.771 --> 03:11.066
It's not part of the job description.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.818
So, what do I do?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.695
You know what?

03:14.736 --> 03:17.072
I'm gonna tell you what not to do instead, okay?

03:19.366 --> 03:23.037
Don't do anything just because you can.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.040
Don't do anything you don't love.

03:26.081 --> 03:27.332
And don't do anything

03:27.374 --> 03:30.209
because other people think you should.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.130
Oh, don't do anything

03:33.172 --> 03:37.718
because you're afraid to do something else.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.511
How about that one, huh?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.687
♪♪

04:24.347 --> 04:26.100
Mom?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.644
Hi.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.730
Frank.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.107
Frank.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.737
Have you ever wondered what if your best and truest

04:38.779 --> 04:43.117
and happiest life was like nothing you ever imagined?

04:43.158 --> 04:45.619
You know, do you ever wonder if you would have the --

04:45.660 --> 04:47.495
the balls to live it?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.497
Not nearly enough.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.083
The board meets in an hour, Jack.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.918
What do you want me to tell them?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.086
I don't know.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.462
My whole life I've just been living

04:55.503 --> 04:57.338
a life that other people wanted me to live,

04:57.380 --> 04:58.757
you know, with what was expected.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.593
I've never actually done what I wanted to do.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.137
And you're, like -- For the first time,

05:03.178 --> 05:05.764
I feel like I'm awake and that's thanks to you and...

05:05.806 --> 05:07.766
Oh, God.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.226
Fuck if I know what you should tell them.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.187
I'll rephrase that.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.730
Yeah, please.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.732
I don't want to be sitting here,

05:15.774 --> 05:18.568
like, 25 years from now and leaving

05:18.610 --> 05:21.655
getting the gold watch and -- and -- no offense, by the way.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.324
I love -- Your gold watch was really --

05:24.365 --> 05:25.742
I like that. It looks good on you.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.161
Yeah. Thank you.

05:27.202 --> 05:30.455
Okay.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.706
Goodbye, Jack.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.374
Thank you, sir, for everything.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.004
Sorry about the gold watch thing.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.893
-Hey, babe. -We got it.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.352
We got the theater project.

05:53.394 --> 05:56.815
That's so great. I can't...

05:56.857 --> 05:58.566
Tell me all about it. I just want to hear your voice.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.944
Well, everyone says I'm gonna get partner.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.737
Partner! I mean, I thought --

06:02.779 --> 06:05.157
I thought partners were old.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.909
Wait, does this mean I'm old and I just don't realize it?

06:07.951 --> 06:09.744
I-I'm pretty sure that I've gradually

06:09.786 --> 06:11.496
made the bathroom lights so dim that I can just,

06:11.538 --> 06:14.041
like, vaguely make out a shape of myself.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.045
Mm, we're having mimosas. Can you tell?

06:18.086 --> 06:19.754
I wish you could be here.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.049
I wish you could just come on over.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.219
Jack?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.554
Are you okay?

06:27.595 --> 06:29.430
What if I told you I can come over right now?

06:29.472 --> 06:31.975
Well, I'd say hurry.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.476
All right.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.825
Nina: Iz.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.618
Izzy.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.248
What time is it?

06:54.289 --> 06:55.749
Um, I don't know.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.376
Why don't you ask the phone?

07:00.212 --> 07:02.297
Oh, shit. It's 10:00.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.673
Why "shit"?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.009
Your flight isn't till like 8:30-something.

07:06.051 --> 07:10.847
I just feel like there's, like, a lot to do.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.474
Like what?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.227
I don't know.

07:18.563 --> 07:21.191
Sit up.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.817
Sit up right now.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.028
And look at me.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.490
Why are you crying?

07:29.532 --> 07:32.327
I don't know.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.497
'Cause I'm leaving.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.210
'Cause I'll miss you.

07:48.760 --> 07:52.180
I just talked to my mom.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.514
Was it bad?

07:53.556 --> 07:55.267
It's okay.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.228
She sounded excited, actually.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.855
Sober, as far as I could tell.

08:00.897 --> 08:04.109
She sounded like my mom, which was never awesome,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.945
but it's good for her, I guess.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.447
Did you tell her that you're going home

08:08.488 --> 08:09.948
because it's your turn to be crazy?

08:11.158 --> 08:13.827
Because you -- I don't know,

08:13.868 --> 08:16.579
you want to make things right between the two of you.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.415
Because you...

08:18.457 --> 08:22.127
I told her that I got my heart broken.

08:22.169 --> 08:27.048
So maybe now I could understand a little.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.760
Who could that be?

08:30.802 --> 08:33.180
How the hell should I know?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.597
Andy. It's -- It's Andy.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.849
Andy

08:35.890 --> 08:37.017
'Cause you're abandoning me,

08:37.058 --> 08:39.727
so I'm gonna be revenge-humping him.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.021
I told you.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.147
Already?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.440
Yeah, I just -- I don't know.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.816
I think it's important that you see it.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.818
Not actually, you can absolutely leave,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.820
but I wanted to make sure that you knew.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.824
You told him I was leaving, didn't you?

08:56.911 --> 08:58.955
You -- -Ow! Ow!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.374
Not before I spit in your mouth.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.375
-Don't you dare! -Open up.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.001
No.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.127
Hello?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.086
Come on. Open up. Come on.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.254
Hello?

09:06.296 --> 09:07.630
Both: We're coming!

09:07.672 --> 09:09.090
Don't you fucking --

09:09.132 --> 09:11.176
Better not be walking into some freaky shit...

09:11.218 --> 09:13.512
again.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.805
Nina: Andy, let's gangbang her!

09:15.847 --> 09:18.099
I don't know why I said that.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.767
You, uh -- You ever think I could, uh,

09:19.809 --> 09:22.812
maybe walk in here once and just find you girls reading?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.190
Emma: To hard work.

09:29.361 --> 09:31.405
Madam partner.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.323
I know.

09:33.365 --> 09:36.659
I get an obscene raise and profit sharing.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.995
Meanwhile, you're not at school. You're here.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.122
Um, apparently, dressed to go to,

09:41.164 --> 09:44.000
like, a fantasy draft or something?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.335
Seriously, what are you doing here?

09:45.377 --> 09:46.503
Are you okay?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.340
You look like you need a drink.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.675
I declined the position.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.722
Okay.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.558
And then I resigned.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.728
Okay.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.149
And you're not surprised.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.779
No, I'm -- I'm not.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.033
Honey, think about this.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.326
I mean, Hamilton has drug testing.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.702
Yeah.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.496
In the week leading up to my board review,

10:21.538 --> 10:24.665
we were, like, you know -- like Seth Rogen

10:24.707 --> 10:27.710
and who's the female equivalent of Seth Rogen pot

10:27.752 --> 10:31.131
No one 'cause women don't identify like that.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.134
You just blew my mind.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.469
Was Frank pissed?

10:35.510 --> 10:36.928
No. The opposite, actually.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.306
He's the one who -- who led me there.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.765
How

10:40.807 --> 10:42.225
H-He said, "Don't do anything

10:42.267 --> 10:44.894
just because you're scared to do something else."

10:51.526 --> 10:53.945
Look, I know I'm being kind of redundant, but --

10:53.987 --> 10:57.031
I know it's not us, and it's not our life.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.993
It's not who we are, but, baby, why am I saying "it"?

11:00.034 --> 11:02.870
