00:03.667 --> 00:04.417
Guys.

00:05.166 --> 00:06.542
What are you doing Saturday night?

00:06.625 --> 00:08.000
Your mom really needs a night out.

00:08.083 --> 00:09.458
You want us to take mom out?

00:11.500 --> 00:12.750
Isn't that kind of your job?

00:14.542 --> 00:15.875
I need you guys to babysit

00:15.959 --> 00:17.667
so that we can go out to dinner
with the Wentzes.

00:18.125 --> 00:19.709
We're going to Mondello's.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.041
Oh. Isn't that place like super expensive?

00:22.125 --> 00:24.333
I don't care.
Your mother deserves the best.

00:24.583 --> 00:25.667
You got a coupon, huh?

00:28.667 --> 00:29.709
Yes, sir, I do.

00:31.667 --> 00:32.500
Hey.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.166
Bob, honey, the Wentzes just called
and canceled.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.500
They said they have to go to Nebraska
for some family emergency.

00:38.583 --> 00:39.583
Oh, really?

00:40.834 --> 00:43.375
All right. Well, I'll tell the boys
they don't have to babysit.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.291
No, no, no!

00:47.417 --> 00:50.166
I need a night out so bad,
I'm willing to spend it just with you.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.000
And the love affair continues.

- Hi, Teddy.
- Hi, Beau.

01:54.041 --> 01:56.125
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:56.208 --> 01:57.875
Oh, me and your dad have a new plan.

01:57.959 --> 01:58.834
We're carpooling.

01:58.917 --> 02:00.917
Really? Because he just left
to pick you up.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.959
Well, I didn't say it was a good plan.

02:06.917 --> 02:09.583
Listen, while I'm here,
I wanted to ask you something.

02:10.458 --> 02:11.792
Do you have any plans Saturday night?

02:13.083 --> 02:15.208
Beau, that's really sweet, but just...

02:15.917 --> 02:18.125
I have some unresolved feelings
with my old boyfriend,

02:18.208 --> 02:21.208
so I'm not really into dating right now.

02:21.250 --> 02:23.041
I wasn't asking you out on a date.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.083
I should have let you finish.

02:29.458 --> 02:30.792
Why don't you do that now?

02:32.667 --> 02:34.083
See, there's this girl, Katie.

02:34.166 --> 02:36.125
She invited me out
and I want to go, but...

02:36.625 --> 02:38.375
- I don't want her to think it's a date.
- Oh.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.000
So I thought if I brought a friend,
she'd get the message.

02:41.083 --> 02:45.500
Mm. So you're asking me out on a date
that's not really a date

02:45.583 --> 02:48.333
so that you'll look like
you're not on a date.

02:51.083 --> 02:51.917
Exactly.

02:53.041 --> 02:54.250
And I'm asking you,

02:54.333 --> 02:57.041
because I don't know anyone else
who's willing to not date me.

02:58.417 --> 03:01.542
Well, I guess as long
as I'm not not dating anyone.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.625
So it's a not date?

03:04.208 --> 03:05.083
Why not?

03:09.917 --> 03:11.750
Okay, guys. We're leaving.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.500
- Hey, Mom. You look great.
- Oh, thanks, honey.

03:14.875 --> 03:15.875
Dad.

03:17.333 --> 03:18.709
Look how good mom looks.

03:21.208 --> 03:23.625
Oh. I think your father
looks very handsome.

03:23.709 --> 03:24.959
Thank you, honey.

03:25.125 --> 03:27.875
And I'm very much looking forward
to a wonderful night out.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.458
Oh, uh, by the way.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.750
We're taking the bug truck.
I can write off the mileage.

03:33.625 --> 03:34.583
Bob: I'll be right there.

03:35.917 --> 03:36.875
Gentlemen...

03:37.625 --> 03:40.250
tonight, I want nothing to go wrong.

03:40.667 --> 03:45.083
When I come back, I want to see
every baby, every babysitter,

03:45.166 --> 03:47.875
and everything in the house
just the way it is now.

03:47.959 --> 03:48.792
You got that, PJ?

03:48.875 --> 03:51.667
Dad, relax. Everything is under control.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.667
I know. But you say that every time.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.250
Well, one of these times
it's bound to come true.

03:58.667 --> 04:01.083
All right. That's good enough
to get me out of the house.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.333
- Bye.
- Uh-huh.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.166
Okay. Listen up.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.166
Tonight I am Captain of the ship.

04:09.250 --> 04:13.125
And I say there will be no running,
no mess, no horseplay of any kind.

04:13.542 --> 04:14.750
Boring.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.375
Yeah. Why are you being so strict?

04:18.458 --> 04:19.500
I mean, you're worse than mom

04:19.583 --> 04:21.834
and her stupid no fireworks
in the basement rule.

04:23.792 --> 04:24.959
I'll tell you why.

04:25.041 --> 04:28.125
Because I'm tired of everyone always
thinking I'm the irresponsible one.

04:28.208 --> 04:29.041
All right?

04:29.125 --> 04:30.250
That ends tonight.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.625
Uh-oh.

04:32.709 --> 04:33.583
What?

04:33.667 --> 04:37.250
Either I just wet myself,
or I sat on Charlie's juice box.

04:39.542 --> 04:41.583
I'm not sure what to root for here.

04:44.959 --> 04:47.458
Oh, no! It's mom's new couch.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.875
Well, you had a good 30 seconds, Captain.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.166
Welcome to Boots N Saddles.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.583
I've never been to
a Country-Western place before.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.375
Sit down. You're gonna love it.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.250
So, where's Katie?

05:08.375 --> 05:09.709
She should be here any minute.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.959
Howdy, partners.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.208
I'm Donald, your server.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.959
Can I get you something
from the watering hole?

05:18.208 --> 05:22.041
Donald, it doesn't sound like your heart's
really into this Country-Western thing.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.166
My dream was to work
in the yogurt business,

05:24.250 --> 05:26.458
but you gotta know someone to get in.

05:27.834 --> 05:31.041
Um, I'll have a lemonade.

05:31.125 --> 05:32.000
Make that two.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.083
Coming right up, y'all.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.792
So, how do you like working for my dad?

05:37.875 --> 05:38.709
I love it.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.041
He's a great guy.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.083
But he sure does tell a lot
of bug stories.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.500
And they all end the same way.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.250
Both: "And then I killed it."

05:50.500 --> 05:51.750
Oh, man.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.583
Katie can't make it.

05:53.667 --> 05:54.500
Oh.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.625
Well then, we should cancel the lemonades
because my job's done.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.834
- Where's Donald?
- Hold up. Hold up.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.375
As long as we're here,
we might as well stay and hang out.

06:02.458 --> 06:04.250
I don't know. This isn't really my thing.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.959
What's not your thing? Having fun?

06:06.333 --> 06:09.625
Are you kidding?
Nobody's more fun than me.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.709
Barrels of monkeys look at me and go,

06:12.792 --> 06:14.875
"Wow! We wish we were that fun."

06:16.041 --> 06:17.709
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

06:17.792 --> 06:19.000
I don't believe you.

06:19.959 --> 06:22.000
Are you implying
that you don't think I'm fun?

06:22.083 --> 06:23.583
Actually, I'm kind of saying it.

06:26.041 --> 06:26.875
Oh yeah?

06:26.959 --> 06:29.458
All right. Well, I'll show you
how much fun I am.

06:29.542 --> 06:33.458
I'm gonna order up a Mess-o-grub.

06:33.542 --> 06:36.792
And then when I'm done eating,
I'm gonna ride that mechanical bull.

06:38.291 --> 06:39.750
Just from prior experience...

06:41.125 --> 06:42.500
you might want to reverse that.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.125
Anything look good?

06:51.208 --> 06:53.917
Uh, you mean other than my beautiful wife?

06:55.500 --> 06:58.333
Mr. Duncan. Are you flirting with me?

06:58.375 --> 07:00.583
I believe I am.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.208
Uh, anything look good to you?

07:04.250 --> 07:05.250
No.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.750
Well, that was kind of hurtful.

07:11.625 --> 07:13.125
Not you. Look.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.250
The Wentzes?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.834
I thought they had some kind
of family emergency.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.542
In Nebraska.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.375
Do you think they blew us off?

07:23.500 --> 07:25.000
There's only one way to find out.

07:25.417 --> 07:26.792
I'm gonna call Mary Lou.

07:27.625 --> 07:30.208
If she says they're in Nebraska,
then we have our answer.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.667
I don't believe it.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.458
Did you do something to tick her off?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.834
Well, don't be ridiculous.
When have I ever ticked anyone off?

07:48.583 --> 07:49.625
You know what?

07:49.709 --> 07:51.083
Let me call Harry.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.834
Let's see what's going on.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
♪ You're in trouble, you're in trouble ♪

08:14.291 --> 08:16.083
It was your grape juice.

08:16.166 --> 08:17.458
It was your butt.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.125
Oh, what are you smiling about, Toby?

08:24.375 --> 08:26.542
I could pin this on you
in a New York minute, what would you say?

08:26.625 --> 08:27.959
Gah gah gah gah.

08:30.166 --> 08:31.500
Gah gah gah gah gah.

08:31.583 --> 08:33.208
- PJ, calm down.
- It's happening again.

08:33.250 --> 08:35.375
I'm in charge, and I'm blowing it.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.625
Relax.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.583
The couch repair guy will be here soon.

08:38.667 --> 08:39.875
Well how do we know he's any good?

08:39.959 --> 08:41.792
He had an ad on the Internet.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.250
They don't just give those to anybody.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.792
Sofa surgeon.

08:50.959 --> 08:52.291
Thanks for coming over so quickly.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.625
Sure. Where's the patient?

08:55.166 --> 08:56.083
Patient?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.458
Well, you take this surgeon thing
pretty seriously.

08:58.542 --> 09:02.208
Well, I didn't put yellow blinking lights
on the top of my hatchback

09:02.291 --> 09:04.333
because I don't take it seriously.

09:05.875 --> 09:06.834
- It's right over here.
- Okay.

09:06.917 --> 09:08.792
- What is the nature of the stain?
- It's grape juice.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.959
And we're done.

09:10.709 --> 09:11.792
You're giving up already?

09:11.875 --> 09:13.250
Oh, it's grape juice, man.

09:13.917 --> 09:15.583
I am a sofa surgeon.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.458
Not a miracle worker.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.000
Isn't there anything we can do?

09:20.083 --> 09:22.500
If our parents come home and see this,
we're gonna be in huge trouble.

09:22.583 --> 09:23.583
Well, mostly him.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.792
Your only option
is to replace the deceased.

09:27.875 --> 09:30.583
You find another couch
that looks exactly like this one.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.000
How are we supposed to do that?

09:32.083 --> 09:34.875
I mean, go to an all-night couch store?

09:36.667 --> 09:38.083
Alan's all-night couch store.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.417
Oh, and if you use my name,
you get a free balloon.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
I'm in.

09:49.834 --> 09:51.375
You don't have to do this.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.041
I've done this before.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.750
You've ridden a mechanical bull?

09:54.834 --> 09:58.125
No. But I rode a pony
outside the grocery store.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.333
Well, as long as you've had experience.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.417
Giddy up.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.709
Whoa, whoa!

10:15.542 --> 10:18.041
Aah!

10:25.250 --> 10:26.208
You okay?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.625
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.083
Am I standing up?

10:40.041 --> 10:41.208
Look at them over there.

10:41.583 --> 10:44.500
Talking, laughing,
having a grand old time.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.709
Makes me sick.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.208
I don't get it.
Why would the Wentzes blow us off?

10:51.583 --> 10:53.083
Oh, I don't know.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.709
- I mean, we're a fun couple, right?
- Yes.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.000
Uh-huh.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.291
Now what is that supposed to mean?

11:01.375 --> 11:08.250
I just... In social situations,
you tend to talk about bugs and rodents.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.000
A lot.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.750
So, now, this is my fault?

11:12.834 --> 11:14.583
Bob, I'm your wife.
Of course it's your fault.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.750
Honey, I mean,
since we're pointing fingers,

11:17.834 --> 11:21.583
I mean, you know, you tend
to talk about yourself.

11:21.667 --> 11:22.709
A lot.

11:23.041 --> 11:25.917
Well, at least I'm talking
about something interesting.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.166
Are you?

11:29.291 --> 11:30.667
Yes, I am.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.166
I happen to be a fascinating woman.

11:34.125 --> 11:35.208
You see what we're doing here?

11:35.291 --> 11:37.000
We're turning on each other like rats.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.542
And we're back to you.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.041
Well, that was great.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.542
At least now I can cross riding
a mechanical bull off my bucket list.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.417
- You have a bucket list?
- Yeah.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.208
I started making one
about halfway through the bull ride.

11:59.709 --> 12:01.166
Hey, partners.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.667
Uh, the karaoke machine
is now ready for action.

12:03.959 --> 12:05.041
I reckon.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.166
What do you say?

12:08.250 --> 12:10.875
You want to mosey on over
and sing a little karaoke?

12:10.959 --> 12:12.083
No, thank you.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.333
I can't really sing.

12:13.417 --> 12:15.250
What? It's karaoke.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.583
You don't have to be good.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.166
I don't think so.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.417
Well.

12:19.709 --> 12:21.875
Look who's wearing the not fun hat now?

12:23.333 --> 12:24.291
That's not gonna work.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.083
And the not fun shirt.

12:26.166 --> 12:28.083
And the not fun boots.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.583
You stop right there.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.750
You can mess with my hat,
you can mess with my shirt,

12:33.542 --> 12:34.875
but you leave my boots out of it.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.458
Well, then, let's go.

12:41.250 --> 12:42.250
Okay.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.750
What song do you want to sing?

12:44.250 --> 12:45.333
Something short.

12:45.792 --> 12:46.959
Like your bull ride.

12:48.792 --> 12:49.875
Maybe this one.

12:50.542 --> 12:51.500

14:31.125 --> 14:33.041
Hello? Anybody here?

14:33.333 --> 14:34.625
May I help you?

14:36.458 --> 14:37.500
Hey, it's you again.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.041
Excuse me?

14:39.125 --> 14:40.375
You're the sofa surgeon.

14:40.458 --> 14:42.208
Uh, was the sofa surgeon.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.208
Yes, now I'm Alan, and I'm the owner
of the all-night couch store.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.583
Well, whoever you are, where's our couch?

14:48.667 --> 14:49.917
You said you had one just like it.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.250
Oh, no, no, no.
The sofa surgeon said that.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.500
Yeah, no, see his job
is to get you in the store.

14:54.583 --> 14:57.000
My job is to help you deal
with your disappointment.

14:59.125 --> 15:03.041
Well, I just want to say for the record,
both of you have really let us down.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.000
Hey.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.250
Check it out. That looks like
the green couch we used to have.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.333
So, what? That's not gonna help us.

15:10.583 --> 15:11.417
Or is it?

15:11.959 --> 15:14.500
- Okay, call me crazy.
- You're crazy.

15:16.417 --> 15:17.583
Anyway...

15:18.250 --> 15:20.583
What if we replace the yellow couch
with this green one?

15:20.667 --> 15:22.709
Mom and dad were so used
to seeing this couch for years.

15:22.792 --> 15:25.250
Maybe their brains will trick them
into believing it's the right couch.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.041
That's your plan?

15:27.458 --> 15:29.166
To trick mom and dad's brains?

15:29.250 --> 15:30.500
- Yes.
- I love it.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.834
Okay. Let's go.

15:38.250 --> 15:39.083
Great.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.250
Now we have to walk right past
the Wentzes.

15:42.917 --> 15:45.458
Maybe we should just climb out
the bathroom window instead.

15:45.542 --> 15:47.583
But why are we avoiding them?

15:48.333 --> 15:49.959
They're the ones
who should be avoiding us.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.458
They're the liars.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.375
Yes. Yes, they are.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.750
Okay, let's walk past them
with our heads held high.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.208
Oh, Amy, Bob.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.208
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.250
Hi.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.041
What are you guys doing here?

16:05.125 --> 16:07.125
I thought you had a family emergency.

16:07.208 --> 16:10.458
Oh, it turns out my uncle didn't have
to go to the hospital after all.

16:10.542 --> 16:11.834
- Oh.
- Wow.

16:11.917 --> 16:12.917
Lucky him.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.625
And by the time we found out,
it was too late to call you.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.625
Oh, that's interesting,
because I actually called you earlier,

16:20.709 --> 16:21.750
but no one answered.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.792
I tell you what, I just got a new phone.

16:24.875 --> 16:28.709
And I can't seem to figure out
how to use it.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.291
Uh, what about you, Harry?

16:35.375 --> 16:37.083
Oh, darn family plan.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.458
I have the same phone.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.750
And I'm usually just like...

16:45.792 --> 16:47.792
Want to hear something really funny?

16:48.959 --> 16:52.250
We actually thought you guys
were trying to avoid us.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.458
- What? You can't be serious.
- Oh, that's hilarious.

16:55.542 --> 16:57.750
- Right?
- I know. I know.

16:57.834 --> 17:00.583
Okay. All right.
Let's get together soon, okay?

17:00.667 --> 17:01.959
Okay, try and stop us.

17:02.041 --> 17:04.542
All right, bye.

17:07.875 --> 17:08.792
You think they bought it?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.667
Those two? Oh, yeah.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.834
You know, I have to admit.

17:19.917 --> 17:21.250
I had a great time tonight.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.875
It was the best not date
I've ever been on.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.625
Listen, there's something
I've got to tell you.

17:27.709 --> 17:28.542
What?

17:28.834 --> 17:30.250
There never was another girl.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.208
I kind of made her up.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.458
Why would you do that?

17:37.333 --> 17:38.542
Because.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.375
You said you didn't want to date anyone,
and I wanted to go out with you.

17:43.917 --> 17:45.208
Oh.

17:47.792 --> 17:52.000
The thing is, Teddy, ever since I met you,
I felt like there was a connection.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.458
I kind of think you feel something too.

17:56.792 --> 17:57.750
I don't know.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.917
Don't you feel something right now?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.041
Maybe.

18:09.542 --> 18:10.709
Definitely.

18:12.583 --> 18:13.625
Good night, Beau.

18:13.709 --> 18:14.917
Good night, Teddy.

18:17.083 --> 18:17.959
Bye.

18:24.041 --> 18:27.291
Okay, when mom and dad come in,
just, uh, you know, act natural.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.458
Okay. Uh, how about this?

18:29.917 --> 18:31.250
Uh, no, no, no.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.417
No, not on the couch,
because you'll draw attention to it.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.333
Oh.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.417
Although, now you're off it,
it's practically screaming,

18:36.500 --> 18:37.583
"Hey, look at me!"

18:40.208 --> 18:42.625
- Hey.
- Hey, you guys. We're home.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.458
- How was your night?
- You guys have a good time?

18:44.542 --> 18:47.917
Yeah, a little rocky at first, but yeah.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.083
Yeah. How was everything here?

18:49.166 --> 18:50.667
Oh, little ones are safely in bed.

18:50.750 --> 18:52.250
- Just like you two should be.
- Yeah.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.542
Wow. I'm impressed.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.667
Whole evening, no trouble.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.542
Mm-hm. One in a row.

19:02.583 --> 19:04.166
Thanks, guys. You're the best.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.875
- Mwah! Good night.
- All right. Good night.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.917
It worked.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
Told you.

19:11.583 --> 19:12.709
Wait a minute.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.125
Something's different.

19:16.417 --> 19:18.375
- Really? Everything looks fine to me.
- Yeah.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.959
If anything, it looks more normal
than usual.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.417
This belongs here.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.125
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's...

19:28.583 --> 19:29.458
That's better.

19:29.542 --> 19:30.709
- That's so much better.
- Hey.

19:30.792 --> 19:31.875
- Good eye, Mom.
- Yeah.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.458
Amy: Lucky for you two,
I hated that yellow couch.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.041
Well, Charlie,
I went on my first ever not date.

19:47.125 --> 19:50.667
And I got to say, not bad.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.750
In fact, very not bad.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.917
I guess you could say, uh,
old Teddy Duncan is back...

20:00.500 --> 20:02.792
back in the saddle.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.125
I reckon.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.417
Oh.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.125
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hi, Dad.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.000
Oh.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.709
By the way, the family's got
a little pool going.

20:13.792 --> 20:16.250
When will dad notice the new old couch?

20:18.709 --> 20:20.250
- Something wrong, Dad?
- Yep.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.583
It's the couch.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.750
I'm always losing my phone in it.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.750
Man, sometimes I can be so clueless.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.625
Hmm. You heard the man.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.166
Good luck, Charlie.

20:44.250 --> 20:47.166
I can't believe
we're being blown off. Again.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.125
I know. Especially by them.

20:50.083 --> 20:53.250
They told me they were gonna
stay home tonight and go to bed early.

20:53.375 --> 20:55.333
Maybe we're wrong. Maybe it's not them.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.000
Oh, it's them. Come on.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.000
Well, well, well.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.542
How's bedtime going?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.166
Hi, Mommy.

21:09.250 --> 21:10.834
You guys are blowing us off.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.834
No. We love you guys.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.083
Both: Oh!

21:16.458 --> 21:18.500
What were we thinking? They love us.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.583
Oh, of course they do.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.834
Hey, enjoy your dinner, kids, okay?

21:26.041 --> 21:27.500
Do you think they bought it?

21:27.917 --> 21:28.834
Yep!
