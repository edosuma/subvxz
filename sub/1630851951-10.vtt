00:10.528 --> 00:12.561
I was about

00:12.663 --> 00:15.364
Hey, did you know
because of the turn out

00:15.466 --> 00:17.132
that they had down at City Hall,

00:17.234 --> 00:19.301
they're going to call
a Town Hall meeting

00:19.403 --> 00:21.070
in about two weeks.

00:21.172 --> 00:24.673
- Good, very good.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.346

00:31.449 --> 00:34.083
- What's that noise?

00:34.185 --> 00:35.718
- A joyful noise.

what's that smell?

00:54.472 --> 00:57.406
It's like somewhere in
between week-old chitlins

00:57.541 --> 01:00.409
and--and third-world
dumpster.

01:05.883 --> 01:09.351
- Um, that smell would be
your father, Son.

01:09.487 --> 01:10.986
- You're crazy.
I don't stink.

01:11.122 --> 01:12.721
[sniffing]

01:12.857 --> 01:16.458
Ah, yeah, it's me, I stink
real bad.

01:16.594 --> 01:19.561
Just to be clear,
that scent, that smell,

01:19.697 --> 01:21.396
that's the scent
of hard work.

01:21.532 --> 01:22.831
Something y'all don't
know nothing about.

01:22.967 --> 01:25.534
- Well, I'm doing the hard
work of trying to pass--

01:25.669 --> 01:28.203
pass...

01:28.339 --> 01:30.606
- Hey, hey, look.
- Uh.

01:30.741 --> 01:31.673
- I haven't eaten
breakfast yet,

01:31.809 --> 01:33.542
and I've already
mowed the lawn,

01:33.677 --> 01:34.877
fixed the water heater,
and I've listened to

01:35.012 --> 01:36.845
Anastasia tell me the story
about the time

01:36.981 --> 01:41.383
she went skydiving
with Dolemite twice.

01:41.519 --> 01:44.419
- Why don't you take
a much-needed break, right?

01:44.555 --> 01:47.556
And then me and you can
go find us a greasy spoon,

01:47.691 --> 01:50.926
and get us some pancakes
like we used to before we had

01:51.061 --> 01:52.694
responsibilities and stuff, you
know what I'm saying.

01:52.830 --> 01:54.763
- I would love to, baby, but
we do have responsibilities,

01:54.899 --> 01:56.532
alright, I got a million
things to do around here.

01:56.667 --> 01:57.666
I just can't right now.

01:57.802 --> 01:58.934
- It's fine.

01:59.069 --> 02:01.170
I wanted to sit here and
eat this soggy-ass cereal

02:01.305 --> 02:04.173
for breakfast anyway.

02:04.308 --> 02:05.641
- Maybe tomorrow, okay?

02:05.776 --> 02:07.876
- Oh, Efe wanted me to
tell you that

02:08.012 --> 02:09.545
you need to fix his toilet
again.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.580
- Alright, sorry, baby,
maybe next month.

02:13.150 --> 02:14.650
- He said that it's doing
that thing again where

02:14.785 --> 02:16.485
it's yelling at him.
I don't know.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.287
It always seems so angry.
- Yeah, it's probably

02:18.422 --> 02:19.521
'cause of what Efe
is feeding it.

02:21.292 --> 02:23.325
- [phone dings]

02:23.460 --> 02:24.893
- Who is texting you, boy?

02:25.029 --> 02:26.695
It better not be that
girl from your algebra class

02:26.831 --> 02:30.866
with the dookie braids that
was twerking at the talent show.

02:31.001 --> 02:34.403
- [sighs] Man, I wish Big Booty
Judy was blowing me up,

02:34.538 --> 02:36.638
but, no, it's the school's
basketball coach.

02:36.774 --> 02:38.407
- What did the coach
want?

02:38.542 --> 02:40.576
- Uh, he's begging me
to try out for the team.

02:40.711 --> 02:42.077
- The coach must have heard
how much of a baller

02:42.213 --> 02:44.813
your daddy was back
in the day. Uh, for three!

02:47.685 --> 02:49.418
- [coughs]
Oh lord.

02:49.553 --> 02:50.919
- Really?
- That's brutal.

02:51.055 --> 02:53.689
That's brutal.
- There you go trying

02:53.824 --> 02:56.191
to relive your so-called
"glory days."

02:56.327 --> 02:58.760
- They're called glory days
because I won a championship.

02:58.896 --> 03:00.963
- You were 11.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.564
- And? What that mean?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.433
Shoot, the team--the other
team we played against, ssh,

03:04.568 --> 03:06.034
they were advanced.
- Uh, how advanced

03:06.170 --> 03:08.070
could they be in fifth grade?

03:08.205 --> 03:10.038
- Well, they had tattoos,
alright?

03:10.174 --> 03:11.273
Now, come on, chop-chop.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.508
What you waiting for?
Let's go.

03:13.644 --> 03:15.510
- My waffles to come
out the toaster.

03:15.646 --> 03:16.545
- Man, forget them
waffles.

03:16.680 --> 03:17.880
You got tryouts today,

03:18.015 --> 03:19.281
it's time to get you
prepared, alright?

03:19.416 --> 03:21.016
Go get your ball.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:21.151 --> 03:22.718
I thought you had a lot
of work to do today.

03:22.853 --> 03:24.853
Like taking a bath.
- Listen, Son.

03:24.989 --> 03:26.255
There are some things
in life that are way

03:26.390 --> 03:28.624
more important than work.

03:28.759 --> 03:31.393
And living your dreams
vicariously through your son

03:31.528 --> 03:33.128
is one of them.

Sorry, that's what you had.

04:22.413 --> 04:24.079
The game Sorry, yeah.

04:24.214 --> 04:26.515

LeBron James with it.

04:26.650 --> 04:28.550
- Hold up.
- [whistle blows]

04:28.686 --> 04:32.054
- You were like a young
LeBron Shames.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.689
Now your granddad on
the other hand,

04:33.824 --> 04:35.791
stupid skills.
- Alright, what was

04:35.926 --> 04:38.493
your playground nickname?
- See, they call me

04:38.629 --> 04:40.963
The GOAT, baby. [laughs]

04:41.098 --> 04:42.564
- Okay,
Greatest of All Time?

04:42.700 --> 04:44.700
- No, no, like an actual goat.

04:44.835 --> 04:46.935
See, your granddaddy wasn't
fond of deodorant,

04:47.071 --> 04:49.571
but, man, I could play
it on that playground.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.006
I was something else, boy.

04:51.141 --> 04:53.108
- Man, I've coached him
up great, okay? Alright.

04:53.243 --> 04:55.911
Now that crossover is butter.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.679

- Oooh-hoo.

04:59.416 --> 05:00.782
- BOTH: Wet.

05:00.918 --> 05:02.184
- [laughs] Look, I don't
even know if you trying

05:02.319 --> 05:04.319
to teach a boy how to
play basketball,

05:04.455 --> 05:06.888
how to cook, how to lose
money, take a bath.

05:07.024 --> 05:09.324
I don't know what the hell
you trying to teach him.

05:09.460 --> 05:10.926
- What he's saying is,
he coached me on how

05:11.061 --> 05:13.795
to dribble, pass, and shoot.

05:13.931 --> 05:15.130
- You're not teaching him

05:15.265 --> 05:17.099
the fundamentals of the game,
man.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.134
The most important part
of the game!

05:19.269 --> 05:22.137
- And what's that?
- Trash talking.

05:22.272 --> 05:24.740
I mean, how to get up in
a player's head, man.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.408
- Trash talking?

05:26.543 --> 05:28.176
- And you gotta hit 'em with
the, "Your grandmamma

05:28.312 --> 05:33.115
got one tooth, take her
a month to eat corn."

05:33.250 --> 05:35.951
You gotta hit him with, "Your
grandmamma got a job

05:36.086 --> 05:39.421
at the bakery fixing broken
biscuits."

05:39.556 --> 05:41.156
[laughs]
Throw his game off.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.624

gonna do?'

05:42.760 --> 05:43.792
- Well, guess what?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.961

was your wife.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.262
- Mm.

Grandpa just said, alright?

05:52.669 --> 05:53.535

05:55.139 --> 05:56.471
- Oh, nice cheerleading
outfit.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.442
- This was the costume
I wore in my movie

06:00.577 --> 06:04.279
"Disco Kung-Fu Cheerleaders

06:04.415 --> 06:08.350

06:08.485 --> 06:10.085
- Think I've seen that.
- And I heard that there

06:10.220 --> 06:12.487
was a budding basketball
star out here,

06:12.623 --> 06:16.324
and I wanted to come
and cheer you on to victory.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.627
- Okay, well, let's see
what you got.

06:18.762 --> 06:21.363
- Well, that's why
I wore this,

06:21.498 --> 06:24.599

- Eh.

06:24.735 --> 06:26.334

07:33.837 --> 07:35.270

give advice in three areas:

07:39.042 --> 07:40.909
fame, romance,

07:41.044 --> 07:42.878
and what to look for in a good
attorney.

that is.

- Right. I need to know how to
set a romantic scene.

not something you should

be offended

07:59.963 --> 08:02.364
or to pat myself on the back.

08:02.499 --> 08:04.199
- Oh, no, no, I don't
mean like you're a thot

08:04.334 --> 08:06.301

you're just so classy

08:06.436 --> 08:08.103

fancy things.

there.

08:13.277 --> 08:16.545

a romantic mood?

the Soviet Union would

08:27.624 --> 08:31.560

candlelight is key,
the more the better.

08:37.901 --> 08:40.869

your crowfeet.

crow's feet.

08:43.006 --> 08:45.106

on the regular.

08:45.242 --> 08:47.108

however many you can
afford.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.347

is new.

08:52.482 --> 08:54.516
Yellow if you're gonna
be friends.

hubba-bubba?

it's holding hands.

09:02.559 --> 09:05.026
- Oh, okay, red roses,
then definitely red.

09:05.162 --> 09:08.463
- Mood music and
dessert are also a must,

Smokey Robinson.

light and sweet.

so good.

this favor.

Could you not tell my parents
about our little conversation?

09:24.281 --> 09:25.447
- I hadn't planned to,

09:25.582 --> 09:28.883
but now I'm wondering
if I should.

09:29.019 --> 09:31.987
- I just don't want them asking
a hundred million questions.

09:32.122 --> 09:33.455
You know, I was just curious
about how to set

09:33.590 --> 09:36.825
a romantic scene
for the far future.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.059
- The future?

09:38.195 --> 09:41.096
- Far, far sometime later.
[laughs]

09:41.231 --> 09:42.597
- Okay, dear.

09:56.079 --> 09:59.180
- How come adults always
ask so many questions?

09:59.316 --> 10:01.049
- Hey, Sis, love that
shirt on you.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.517
- Okay, who are you?

10:02.653 --> 10:04.552
And what have you done
with my little brother?

10:04.688 --> 10:07.122
- What?
It's a wonderful day.

10:07.257 --> 10:08.690
And I can't be happy?

10:08.825 --> 10:10.492
- Okay, okay, I get it.

10:10.627 --> 10:13.061
You made the basketball
team, congratulations.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.397
- No, I didn't.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.432
- Okay, well, then I think
I need to go get Mom,

10:17.567 --> 10:20.402
because you definitely took
a major blow to the head.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.237
You know failure's supposed
to make you sad, right?

10:22.372 --> 10:24.706
- Yeah, I'd be sad if
I wanted to make the team.

10:24.841 --> 10:27.809
But I didn't,
so score.

10:27.944 --> 10:29.044
- You didn't wanna
make the team?

10:29.179 --> 10:30.512
- No, I don't
wanna play.

10:30.647 --> 10:32.247
The only reason I tried
out is because

10:32.382 --> 10:34.416
Dad seemed excited, so I used
it as an opportunity

10:34.551 --> 10:35.917
to spend some time together.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.152
- Oh.

10:37.287 --> 10:41.823
- Hey, there's my future
NBA star.

10:41.958 --> 10:43.391
Man, how did tryouts go?

10:43.527 --> 10:44.726
- Great.

10:44.861 --> 10:45.994
- So you made the team?

10:46.129 --> 10:48.930
- I sure did.
- Ah, that's my boy.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.965
Yeah, yeah, proud
of you, Son.

10:51.101 --> 10:53.501
Yeah, man, good job.

10:53.637 --> 10:55.403
Yeah, what y'all
talking about?

10:55.539 --> 10:56.671
- Uh--
- Oh, nothing.

10:56.807 --> 10:59.341
Just about how great
the tryouts were.

10:59.476 --> 11:00.442
- Oh yeah?

11:00.577 --> 11:01.910
- ♪

11:02.045 --> 11:02.711
- Go for three!

11:05.115 --> 11:06.715
that sounds so good.

11:06.850 --> 11:09.250
- Good afternoon, Sandra.

11:09.386 --> 11:10.285
- Hi.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.786
Sorry, ear hustler alert.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.524
- That girl is
up to something.

11:21.365 --> 11:24.799
It's not ladylike to
eavesdrop, Anastasia.

11:30.273 --> 11:35.744
- [humming]

11:35.879 --> 11:39.214
- Efe, you're not a lady.

11:39.349 --> 11:40.949
- Not the last time
I checked.

11:41.084 --> 11:43.918
But I do like puppy videos and
pumpkin spice everything.

11:44.054 --> 11:45.520
- Sandra is up to something.

11:45.655 --> 11:46.788
I need you to eavesdrop.

11:46.923 --> 11:47.722
- Why don't you eavesdrop?

11:47.858 --> 11:48.957
- It's beneath me.

11:49.092 --> 11:50.458
- And why is it not
beneath me?

11:50.594 --> 11:53.161
- This morning, I saw you
eat a nacho off the floor,

11:53.296 --> 11:56.297
and you didn't bother
to blow off the stray hair.

11:56.433 --> 11:57.665
- That is a valid point.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.101
But I must remind you that
my hearing is not as good

12:00.237 --> 12:02.070
as it used to be.
- Mine isn't either.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.105
Perhaps we should combine
our hearing powers.

12:06.676 --> 12:08.176
- Ooh, I can hear
her clearly.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.079
She's planning "to meet
Bell Biv Devoe to fight."

12:11.214 --> 12:14.516
- No, she's planning
a romantic rendezvous tonight.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.850
- No, I believe I'm
correct.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.552
You cannot trust
a big butt and a smile.

12:17.687 --> 12:20.321
- Shhh!
- Oh, okay.

12:20.457 --> 12:23.224
She says she's going to
"sneak up and slap Neo."

12:23.360 --> 12:25.026
- Oh, no.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.529
She says to "sneak up
the back patio."

12:27.664 --> 12:30.165
- Oh, this is like
the fable of the blind man

12:30.300 --> 12:33.668
that was
describing an elephant.

12:33.804 --> 12:36.671
Did you hear that?
She said "Linda."

12:36.807 --> 12:37.872
Who is Linda?

12:38.008 --> 12:40.341
- No, nincompoop,
she said Lindor!

12:40.477 --> 12:42.343
We got it!

12:42.479 --> 12:45.280
She is setting up
a romantic rendezvous

12:45.415 --> 12:48.383
tonight on the patio
with Lindor.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.784
- I disagree.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.086
I believe she's plotting
to beat Neo, Bell,

12:52.222 --> 12:55.490
and Bell Biv Devoe.

12:55.625 --> 12:56.958
But you can do you.

12:57.093 --> 12:58.993
Me, I'm going to have
some hair-free nachos.

12:59.129 --> 13:00.462
Check it out.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.533
- Jeremy, I have
something very important

13:05.669 --> 13:07.068
to talk to you about.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.369
- Ok, whatever it is,
it's not more important

13:08.505 --> 13:09.771
Than us getting to
Philip's game.

13:09.906 --> 13:10.805
And we need to get
there ASAP.

13:10.941 --> 13:12.974
- Okay?
- It's about...

13:13.109 --> 13:15.977
something that can wait.

13:16.112 --> 13:17.612
Good luck with your game,
Philip.

13:17.747 --> 13:19.848
- Wait, Philip, you're
going to the game?

13:19.983 --> 13:21.015
- Of course he's going
to the game.

13:21.151 --> 13:22.150
He's the starting point guard.

13:22.285 --> 13:23.685
And guess who his dad is?

13:26.590 --> 13:29.190
- Philip, you let Dad
get a custom jersey?

13:29.326 --> 13:30.558
Wow.

13:30.694 --> 13:32.227
- Grandpa was gonna get
one too, but the people

13:32.362 --> 13:33.761
that made it, they wouldn't
make one that said,

13:33.897 --> 13:35.930
"Your granny has
tetherball boobs."

13:36.066 --> 13:39.167
- And so, Philip, where's
your uniform at?

13:39.302 --> 13:41.002
- My--my uniform?
- Mm-hmm.

13:41.137 --> 13:44.305
- Yeah, um,
it's in my locker.

13:44.441 --> 13:46.207
- Oh, it's in your locker?
- Where else would it be?

13:46.343 --> 13:47.942
- I can't wait to see you
score your first basket.

13:49.379 --> 13:50.612
- I can't wait to see
how this ends.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.247
- ♪

13:55.619 --> 13:57.719
- Hey! I need to talk
to Mr. Reginald

13:57.854 --> 14:00.321
so he can find me a lawyer,
'cause I'm taking that coach

14:00.457 --> 14:02.190
to court.
- Well, what happened?

14:02.325 --> 14:04.726
- First, they gave everybody
on the team a uniform

14:04.861 --> 14:06.261
except my son.

14:06.396 --> 14:08.696
So, Philip was forced
to wear his PE clothes.

14:08.832 --> 14:09.764
Right?
- Right.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.399
- Well, that's horrible.

14:11.535 --> 14:12.901
- Then they didn't have
enough room for him

14:13.036 --> 14:14.302
on the bench next to
his teammates,

14:14.437 --> 14:15.770
so he had to sit
in the bleachers

14:15.906 --> 14:18.039
next to the bench.
Right?

14:18.174 --> 14:19.474
- What kind of coach
does that?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.943
- Then to top it off--
top it off.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.411
They were getting
blown out,

14:23.547 --> 14:24.746
and he still didn't
put Philip in the game.

14:24.881 --> 14:27.582
He had all these scrubs
in, but not my son?

14:27.717 --> 14:30.051
Come on, man.
- Exactly, 40, 50 points.

14:30.186 --> 14:32.120
- Jeremy, please tell me
you kept your cool.

14:32.255 --> 14:33.421
- Yeah, I kept
my cool.

14:33.557 --> 14:34.789
- Tell the truth.

14:34.925 --> 14:36.991
- I mean, as long as
I could.

14:37.127 --> 14:38.927
- Jeremy, what did
you do?

14:39.062 --> 14:41.095
- All I did was try to
get a chant going,

14:41.231 --> 14:42.664
saying "Put Philip in."

14:42.799 --> 14:44.432
And then security came
out of nowhere,

14:44.568 --> 14:47.101
put me in a headlock,
hit me with a stick!

14:47.237 --> 14:48.636
- Wait a minute now.

14:48.772 --> 14:50.538
- They got on the walkie-talkie
talking about some,

14:50.674 --> 14:53.308
"We got a 10-13."
- Uh, Jeremy you know

14:53.443 --> 14:55.710
a 10-13 is a code for
mental health issues?

14:55.845 --> 14:57.445
- No, I didn't know
that.

14:57.581 --> 14:59.914
And then I might have
kicked the mascot

15:00.050 --> 15:01.883
in the tail feather
on my way out.

15:02.018 --> 15:03.318
- What?

15:06.189 --> 15:08.156
You know what?

15:08.291 --> 15:13.995
This story isn't
quite adding up.

15:14.130 --> 15:18.633
You are awfully quiet
over there, Son.

15:18.768 --> 15:20.201
- Yeah, I mean, I'm...

15:20.337 --> 15:22.003
awfully quiet
when I'm tired.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.273
That game--that game took
a lot out of me.

15:25.408 --> 15:26.975
Matter of fact, I'm
gonna head to bed.

15:27.110 --> 15:28.509
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.278
What you mean you tired?
You didn't get in the game.

15:30.413 --> 15:32.347
What you tired for?
Sit your butt down.

15:32.482 --> 15:34.849
- Are you sure you told
us the whole story?

15:34.985 --> 15:36.284
- Maybe.

15:37.654 --> 15:38.920
- What you mean maybe?
Ain't no maybe.

15:39.055 --> 15:40.321
Either you did or you didn't.

15:40.457 --> 15:42.390
- Okay, would you
believe me if I said

15:42.525 --> 15:45.059
the coach wanted me to
rest for the next game?

15:45.195 --> 15:46.361
- No.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.098
- Fine, I--

15:50.233 --> 15:53.801
I didn't make the team.
- [laughing]

15:56.573 --> 15:58.840
You're serious?

15:58.975 --> 16:03.378
- Of course, he's serious,
baby.

16:03.513 --> 16:07.348
No uniform,
no seat on the bench.

16:07.484 --> 16:10.118
Everyone thinks
you're crazy.

16:10.253 --> 16:11.753
- You know what?
- Hmm?

16:11.888 --> 16:13.454
- Now that I think
about it,

16:13.590 --> 16:15.990
you weren't even
in the program.

16:16.126 --> 16:17.959
And he told me that
all the girls

16:18.094 --> 16:19.394
tore out his page
of the program

16:19.529 --> 16:21.963
so they could get
his autograph.

16:22.098 --> 16:23.398
- LEAH:
You believe that?

16:23.533 --> 16:27.268
- I mean, it sounded
good to me at the time.

16:27.404 --> 16:30.571
- It sounded like something
you wanted to believe.

16:30.707 --> 16:33.675
You're so busy trying
to relive your glory days

16:33.810 --> 16:37.478
through our son, you missed
all the obvious signs.

16:37.614 --> 16:39.380
And almost got yourself
arrested again.

16:39.516 --> 16:41.115
- Huh-uh, huh-uh, you're
not gonna put this on me.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.684
I'm not the one that was
out there lying

16:42.819 --> 16:44.752
to their father, got me
up at the school looking

16:44.888 --> 16:48.923
like boo-boo the fool.
- Jeremy, calm down.

16:49.059 --> 16:50.525
- You know what?

16:50.660 --> 16:51.693
I can't believe you,
man.

16:51.828 --> 16:53.261
Just go to your room.

16:53.396 --> 16:55.263
- But, Dad--
- Go!

17:01.738 --> 17:03.771
- What are we gonna do
about this kid lying--

17:03.907 --> 17:07.442
- I hate to intrude,
but it's quite urgent.

17:07.577 --> 17:08.910
- Well, what is it,
Miss Anastasia?

17:09.045 --> 17:12.680
- Sandra, I believe she's
planning a romantic rendezvous

17:12.816 --> 17:15.783
tonight on the back patio
after everyone goes to sleep.

17:15.919 --> 17:17.251
- With who?

17:17.387 --> 17:22.190
- Lindor.
- [sighs]

17:22.325 --> 17:25.393
- Sandra!
- Shh! Jeremy. Jeremy.

17:25.528 --> 17:26.928
Let me handle this,
baby, this needs to be

17:27.063 --> 17:28.296
a mother-daughter conversation.

17:28.431 --> 17:30.298
- Why? She went behind
my back too.

17:30.433 --> 17:33.034
- Uh, just let me
handle it.

17:33.169 --> 17:35.136
- Alright, but if I catch
Lindor

17:35.271 --> 17:36.471
trying to sneak up in
here again--

17:36.606 --> 17:38.406
- Mm-hmm.
- --it's gonna be a 10-13.

17:38.541 --> 17:41.109
- Okay.
- A 10-14, and a 10-15.

17:41.244 --> 17:43.678
- Um--
- Yeah, that's super crazy.

17:43.813 --> 17:44.846
- Crazy.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.481
- ♪

17:48.485 --> 17:52.186
- What's new, Sandra?

17:52.322 --> 17:54.956
- Oh, uh, nothing.

17:55.091 --> 17:56.357
- Oh no?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.725
You're a little jumpy
this evening.

17:57.861 --> 17:59.160
What's on your mind?
- [phone dings]

17:59.295 --> 18:02.196
- Oh, you know?

18:02.332 --> 18:04.866
- Why you keep
checking your phone?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.201
- Because I'm a teenager.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.469
- Keep getting smart
with me.

18:08.605 --> 18:10.271
I know what you're up to,
young lady.

18:10.406 --> 18:12.740
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.876 --> 18:16.010
- Your father and I may
not know how to TickyTocky,

18:16.146 --> 18:17.545
but we're not stupid.

18:17.680 --> 18:22.283
And frankly, I'm-I'm
disappointed that you felt

18:22.418 --> 18:24.018
like you had to keep
your planning tonight

18:24.154 --> 18:26.254
a secret from your mother.

18:26.389 --> 18:28.790
- Of course I did.
What are you talking about?

18:28.925 --> 18:31.325
- Denying it 'til
the very end, huh?

18:34.164 --> 18:37.331
I'm talking about this.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.567
- [sighs]
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.303
Setting up your little
romantic scene tonight.

18:42.438 --> 18:45.139
You got a million candles
out here.

18:45.275 --> 18:46.440
Dozens of roses.

18:46.576 --> 18:48.409
And--and a white tablecloth

18:48.545 --> 18:51.746
with chocolate covered
strawberries.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.047
- Are you happy now, Mom?

18:53.183 --> 18:54.582
You ruined everything.

18:56.786 --> 18:58.186
- No, Sandra, you ruined
everything.

18:58.321 --> 18:59.754
You ruined everything.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.722
Had you told me what you
were planning this evening,

19:01.858 --> 19:03.457
maybe I could have helped
you with your little date

19:03.593 --> 19:06.093
with Lindor.
- Lindor?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.462
- Oh-oh-oh, it's too late
to play dumb.

19:08.598 --> 19:10.598
Your mother's smart.
I know everything.

19:10.733 --> 19:12.099
- Oh, oh, you know
everything, do you?

19:12.235 --> 19:13.701
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me what you know.

19:13.837 --> 19:16.103
- I know that you were
on the phone with Lindor

19:16.239 --> 19:18.506
planning your little
romantic evening.

19:18.641 --> 19:21.943
- I was on the phone with
Linda, Mom. Linda.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.511
- Who is Linda?

19:23.646 --> 19:26.147
- She's the event planner
that dropped all this stuff off.

19:26.282 --> 19:27.215
She's who I've been texting.

19:27.350 --> 19:28.482
She just left.

19:28.618 --> 19:30.718
Lindor has nothing
to do with this.

19:30.854 --> 19:33.321
- You don't go through
this kind of trouble

19:33.456 --> 19:37.825
to set up a romantic
date night for nobody.

19:37.961 --> 19:40.828
- It's not my date, Mom,
it's yours.

19:40.964 --> 19:42.163
- Me?

19:42.298 --> 19:43.731
- I set all this up for
you and Dad.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.833
That's why I was keeping
it a secret from you both.

19:45.969 --> 19:47.668
- [door opens]
- Ah-ha!

19:47.804 --> 19:49.704
Caught you in the act!
- Jeremy, wait.

19:49.839 --> 19:53.507
- Yeah, where is he?
Where is L. Debarge?

19:53.643 --> 19:55.309
- I don't know,
at his house.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.579
- Oh, you got jokes, huh?
- Jeremy.

19:58.715 --> 20:03.751
Uh, this beautiful
romantic date night...

20:03.887 --> 20:05.953
was set up for us.

20:06.089 --> 20:07.388
- Wait, what?

20:07.523 --> 20:08.956
- Look, Dad, you and Mom
haven't had much time

20:09.092 --> 20:10.925
to spend together, so
I thought I'd just set up

20:11.060 --> 20:12.326
a date night for you two.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.128
- You planned all of this
for us?

20:14.264 --> 20:15.429
- Yes.

20:15.565 --> 20:16.764
And I know you're mad
at Philip.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.499
I knew he didn't
make the team.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.402
He only tried out as a way
to spend time with you, Dad.

20:21.537 --> 20:23.738
- No.
- He told me.

20:23.873 --> 20:25.539
- I think when he found
out he didn't make the team

20:25.675 --> 20:26.841
he didn't know how to
tell you.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.076
He didn't want you to be
ashamed of him.

20:29.212 --> 20:30.645
- Ashamed of my son?

20:33.750 --> 20:37.084
Son, I could never
be ashamed of you.

20:37.220 --> 20:38.686
You understand me?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.588
- Yeah, Dad.

20:40.723 --> 20:42.790
- Look, I'm sorry for
pushing you, okay?

20:42.926 --> 20:44.825
Alright, now from this
point on, whatever it is

20:44.961 --> 20:48.629
that you wanna do, I'm
behind you 100%, okay?

20:51.601 --> 20:52.867
Alright, come on,
everybody.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.936
We having a family
date night.

20:55.071 --> 20:56.704
- Really?
- Let's go!

20:56.839 --> 20:58.940
- [laughs] I want those
chocolate-covered strawberries.

20:59.075 --> 21:00.841
- Yeah, you make sure y'all
save some dessert for me.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.529
- Yeah, yeah, see, this is what
you've been training for, Son.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.031
Yeah, eye of the tiger,
baby.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.433
Yeah, oh, you got this.
You got this.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.968
Yeah, what you gonna
do?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.536
You ain't gonna do
nothing. Huh-uh.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.905
You can't handle him.
You can't see him.

21:15.041 --> 21:16.641
Mostly because you're
farsighted.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.510
- I realize that this
is a competition,

21:19.646 --> 21:22.780
but, uh, hooligan
trash talk doesn't work

21:22.915 --> 21:26.050
in a civilized game
of chess.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.387
- Checkmate.
- Ah!

21:29.522 --> 21:31.288
Look like there's a new
GOAT in town,

21:31.424 --> 21:32.923
and it's my boy.
