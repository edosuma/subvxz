01:50.150 --> 01:52.472
HE RUNS A DANCEWEAR STORE.
HE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

01:52.472 --> 01:54.034
I DO NOT NEED TO
KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

01:54.034 --> 01:56.036
I NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT DANCE.
AND I DO.

OKAY, EVERYBODY UP.

02:08.048 --> 02:09.169
LET'S DO THAT AGAIN.

02:09.169 --> 02:10.611
TOO LAZY TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING NEW?

02:10.611 --> 02:11.932
TOO LAZY TO DO
A TRIPLE PIROUETTE

02:11.932 --> 02:13.333
‐ AT THE END INSTEAD

‐ YES.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.056

MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S
IN ORDER, BLAH BLAH BLAH.

02:35.716 --> 02:37.237
BUT WE HADN'T
GOTTEN AROUND TO IT.

02:37.237 --> 02:39.640
SOMEONE MISPLACED
THE POST‐IT TO REMIND HER.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.401
WHATEVER.
BUT WE FOUND THE POST‐IT

02:41.401 --> 02:42.683
AND IT'S HAPPENING
NEXT WEEK.

02:42.683 --> 02:44.244
GREAT. WHAT DO
I NEED TO DO?

02:44.244 --> 02:45.566
‐ NOTHING.

JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

02:51.812 --> 02:53.894
WHILE WE'RE WAITING,
WE THOUGHT WE'D FORM
A ROCK BAND.

02:53.894 --> 02:56.256
OH, WE HEAR THE STONES
MET LIKE THIS.

02:56.256 --> 02:57.457
VERY BUSY HERE.

02:58.859 --> 03:00.741

‐ WHAT DID YOU DO?

03:00.741 --> 03:02.062
<i>Nothing you wouldn't do.</i>

03:02.062 --> 03:03.063
YOU DIDN'T DRIVE
THROUGH THREE STATES

03:03.063 --> 03:04.464
IN A CONVERTIBLE

03:04.464 --> 03:06.226

‐ I GOT THE REFERENCE.

DO THAT.

03:10.030 --> 03:11.912
‐ <i>I have no doubt.</i>
‐ AND NO ONE WOULD CARE.

03:11.912 --> 03:15.035
I THINK A COUPLE OF KIDS
AT A STOPLIGHT MIGHT HAVE
A BIT OF INTEREST.

03:15.035 --> 03:16.116
AND A NEW SCREENSAVER.

03:16.116 --> 03:17.878
‐ ARE YOU COMING
TO VISIT?
‐ I AM.

03:17.878 --> 03:19.399
‐ WHEN?
‐ IN A COUPLE DAYS.

03:19.399 --> 03:21.121
‐ CAN YOU HANDLE IT?
‐ <i>It's not me,</i>

03:21.121 --> 03:22.523
IT'S THE LIQUOR STORES

BIG TO TELL YOU.

03:27.047 --> 03:29.209
GOVERNMENT SECRETS?
'CAUSE I'M NOT GOOD

03:29.209 --> 03:31.291

‐ I'VE GOT PUTIN ON SPEED DIAL.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.053

MUAH.

03:37.658 --> 03:39.139

‐ OH, I SHOULD
CLEAN UP MY PLACE.

03:43.343 --> 03:45.145
SET UP THE COUCH.
BUY SOME SNACK‐Y STUFF.

03:45.145 --> 03:46.226
FINISH TEACHING CLASS.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.909

FOR THE FUNDRAISER.

THERE'S NOTHING
ON HERE.

WHAT?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.148
BOO'S GONNA
BE WITH CARL.

07:48.148 --> 07:49.670
SASHA'S GONNA
BE WITH THAT GUY.

07:49.670 --> 07:50.991
AND YOU AND ME ARE GONNA
BE BY THE PUNCH BOWL

07:50.991 --> 07:53.153
WATCHING HANDSIES AND
THUMBSIES MAKE OUT ALL NIGHT.

07:53.153 --> 07:54.915
‐ SOUNDS GREAT.
‐ WHAT?

07:54.915 --> 07:56.156
PROM IS AWFUL.

07:56.156 --> 07:57.878
WE WON'T HAVE TO
BUY A DRESS,

07:57.878 --> 07:59.039
OR PAY TO HAVE
OUR HAIR DONE

07:59.039 --> 08:00.681
<i>OR RENT A LIMO.</i>

08:00.681 --> 08:02.482
WE CAN GO IN JEANS,
AND WE CAN EAT

08:02.482 --> 08:04.204
'CAUSE WE WON'T CARE
IF WE LOOK LIKE PIGS

08:04.204 --> 08:07.087
<i>OR IF ANYONE'S GONNA TRY</i>
<i>TO TOUCH OUR BLOATED STOMACHS.</i>

08:07.087 --> 08:09.129
OR WORRY IF WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE IT UP

08:09.129 --> 08:10.490
FOR A LOBSTER DINNER.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.653
WE CAN JUST CHILL
OR NOT EVEN GO.

08:12.653 --> 08:13.974
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

08:13.974 --> 08:15.576
‐ THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.
‐ WHY?

08:15.576 --> 08:17.137
BECAUSE I KIND OF
WANT TO CONSIDER

08:17.137 --> 08:18.298
GIVING IT UP FOR
A LOBSTER DINNER.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.980
<i>WELL, AT LEAST</i>
<i>WE HAVE EACH OTHER.</i>

08:19.980 --> 08:21.502
THAT'S SOMETHING,
RIGHT?

08:21.502 --> 08:23.143
YOUR PICS.

08:23.143 --> 08:25.065
‐ WHAT?
‐ YOUR SKATING PIC.

08:25.065 --> 08:27.307
YOU NEED AN OFFICIAL PHOTO,
SO I TOOK SOME OF YOU
AT THE LAST PRACTICE.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.149
WOW, SOME OF THESE
ARE ACTUALLY GREAT.

08:29.149 --> 08:31.071
WE SPENT A SUMMER
ON ANNIE LEIBOVITZ'S YACHT.

08:31.071 --> 08:34.074
GOT SOME TIPS AND SOME
REALLY EXPENSIVE PARTING GIFTS.

08:34.074 --> 08:36.076
( scoffs )
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.440
<i>( girl chatters )</i>

08:40.440 --> 08:42.883
SO, IF YOU
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER,

08:42.883 --> 08:44.284
I'LL GET YOU
SOME FRIES.

08:44.284 --> 08:45.325
ALL RIGHT.

09:00.380 --> 09:03.063
OH, GEEZ!
MILLY, WHAT THE HELL?

09:03.063 --> 09:04.585
WE HAVE A MAJOR
PROBLEM.

09:04.585 --> 09:05.746
HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.387
TAFTPOKIRIP IS
CONVENING A MEETING

09:07.387 --> 09:08.669
TO DISCUSS
THE AMPHITHEATER.

09:08.669 --> 09:10.070
WE HAVE AN ALARM.

09:10.070 --> 09:11.992
NOTHING GOOD EVER COMES
FROM THESE PEOPLE MEETING.

09:11.992 --> 09:13.473
IT WAS SET.
THE ALARM WAS SET.

09:13.473 --> 09:14.995
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
SOMETHING WAS UP.

09:14.995 --> 09:16.677
IT'S MY JOB TO KNOW
WHEN SOMETHING'S UP.

09:16.677 --> 09:18.158
HOW DID YOU
DISABLE THE ALARM?

09:18.158 --> 09:19.680
MICHELLE, PLEASE.
I OWN PROPERTY.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.881
THAT EXPLAINS NOTHING.

09:20.881 --> 09:22.362
WE HAVE TO NIP
THIS IN THE BUD.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.364
THESE LOCAL YAHOOS
ARE ALWAYS CAUSING
PROBLEMS.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.366
THEY NEVER WANT
ANYTHING TO CHANGE EVER.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.368
ELECTRICITY
FREAKED PEOPLE OUT
AT ONE POINT.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.810
AND WATER.
LET'S LIVE TOGETHER

09:29.810 --> 09:31.371
IN FILTHY QUARTERS
AND NOT BATHE.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.213
THE APES ARE STILL
SHAKING THEIR HEADS
OVER THAT ONE.

09:33.213 --> 09:34.695
WHAT COULD THEIR
PROBLEM BE?

09:34.695 --> 09:37.217
WE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.
WE FILLED OUT ALL
THE PAPERWORK.

09:37.217 --> 09:38.579
I DIDN'T EVEN
SIGN IN PINK INK

09:38.579 --> 09:40.300
'CAUSE FANNY
TOLD ME NOT TO.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.062
IF THERE'S NOT
A REAL PROBLEM,
THEY'LL INVENT ONE.

09:42.062 --> 09:44.144
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO
INSTEAD OF READING A NEWSPAPER.

09:44.144 --> 09:45.826
WELL, CRAP.
THIS IS TERRIBLE.

09:45.826 --> 09:47.227
THEY MADE IT SEEM
LIKE IT WAS NOTHING.

09:47.227 --> 09:50.070
JUST ANOTHER
STANDARD MEETING.

09:50.070 --> 09:51.231
WHO DID?

09:51.231 --> 09:53.233
SAL AND SAM.

09:53.233 --> 09:54.675
YOU TALKED TO
SAL AND SAM?

09:54.675 --> 09:56.076
‐ YEAH.

THEY CAME IN AND WHAT?

10:01.682 --> 10:03.363
THEY TOLD ME
ABOUT THE MEETING?

10:03.363 --> 10:04.885
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

10:04.885 --> 10:06.446
‐ SORT OF.
‐ YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS

10:06.446 --> 10:07.888
AND YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME?

10:07.888 --> 10:09.209
I WAS WITH
THE TUTUS.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.211
ALWAYS.
ALWAYS CALL ME.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.693
THE MINUTE
ANYTHING HAPPENS

10:12.693 --> 10:14.374
THAT CAN'T BE ANSWERED BY
READING A JUDY BLUME NOVEL,

10:14.374 --> 10:15.896
CALL ME.

10:15.896 --> 10:17.257
THIS IS HOW THEY GOT
THE EDGE, YOU KNOW.

10:17.257 --> 10:19.219
THE EDGE?
U2 THE EDGE?

10:19.219 --> 10:21.061
ALL THE MAN WANTED
TO DO WAS BUILD SOME
ECO‐FRIENDLY HOUSES

10:21.061 --> 10:23.063
IN MALIBU.
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

10:23.063 --> 10:24.304
THEY SCHEDULED
A MEETING.

10:24.304 --> 10:25.666
‐ GEEZ.
‐ I TOLD HIM,

10:25.666 --> 10:27.828
"EDGE, GET BACK THERE
AND STOP THAT MEETING.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.229
I DON'T CARE
WHAT CRAZY CRAP

10:29.229 --> 10:31.431
JULIE TAYMOR'S DOING."
DIDN'T LISTEN.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.873
YOU KNOW THE EDGE?
LIKE PERSONALLY?

10:32.873 --> 10:34.234
WE CARPOOLED
FOR A WHILE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.475
NEVER COUNT ON
A ROCK STAR

10:35.475 --> 10:37.077
TO GET A KID TO
A PIANO LESSON ON TIME.

10:37.077 --> 10:39.079
HEY, HOW ABOUT
WE DO SOMETHING

10:39.079 --> 10:40.480
TO BUTTER THEM UP?

10:40.480 --> 10:42.402
LIKE STAGE A BALLET
FOR A TOWN FESTIVAL
OR SOMETHING?

10:42.402 --> 10:44.204
THE EDGE TRIED THAT TOO.
APPEASEMENT.

10:44.204 --> 10:45.646
HE OFFERED
TO PUT IN A PARK.

10:45.646 --> 10:47.207
A DOG RUN.
HE EVEN OFFERED

10:47.207 --> 10:49.369
TO PLAY "THE JOSHUA TREE"
IN ITS ENTIRETY

10:49.369 --> 10:50.450
AT ONE OF THE KIDS'
BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.652
<i>AND DO YOU KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT THAT GOT HIM?</i>

10:51.652 --> 10:53.253
‐ NOTHING?
‐ MAN'S STILL SITTING THERE

10:53.253 --> 10:54.575
WITH HIS THUMB
UP HIS BACKSIDE.

10:54.575 --> 10:56.456
AND I'M ASSUMING HE NEEDS
THAT THUMB TO PLAY, SO...

10:56.456 --> 10:58.298
<i>WE NEED TO MOVE QUICK,</i>
<i>INTERVENE,</i>

10:58.298 --> 10:59.660
<i>THROW THEM OFF</i>
<i>THEIR GAME.</i>

10:59.660 --> 11:01.582
‐ GREAT. HOW.
‐ WE NEED TO SCHEDULE A MEETING.

11:01.582 --> 11:03.383
BUT WE ALREADY HAVE
A SCHEDULED MEETING.

11:03.383 --> 11:04.905
NO, WE NEED TO
SCHEDULE A MEETING

11:04.905 --> 11:06.346
BEFORE THEIR MEETING.

11:06.346 --> 11:07.588
SO LIKE A PRE‐MEETING
MEETING.

11:07.588 --> 11:09.189
A PREEMPTIVE MEETING.

11:09.189 --> 11:11.752
HOME TURF ADVANTAGE IS
NOT JUST FOR FOOTBALL
ANYMORE.

11:11.752 --> 11:13.233
WHAT?!

11:13.233 --> 11:15.235
CLASS IS SUPPOSED
TO START AT 10:00.

11:15.235 --> 11:18.398
HEY.
YOU DON'T TELL US
WHEN CLASS STARTS.

11:18.398 --> 11:21.241
WE TELL YOU
WHEN CLASS STARTS.

11:21.241 --> 11:23.243
CLASS ACTUALLY DOES
START AT 10:00.

11:23.243 --> 11:25.045
BUT 10:30 WOULD
WORK GREAT TOO.

11:25.045 --> 11:26.046
( mouths word )

11:41.061 --> 11:43.223
I'M SORRY.

11:43.223 --> 11:45.065
I'LL BE NICER
TO YOU TONIGHT.

11:45.065 --> 11:46.226
I PROMISE.

11:50.631 --> 11:51.752

11:51.752 --> 11:52.953
WHO WERE YOU
JUST TALKING TO?

11:52.953 --> 11:54.474
MY PLANT.

11:54.474 --> 11:56.316
MARTHA STEWART SAYS
YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR PLANTS.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.639
‐ SHE'S WEIRD.
‐ SHE'S MARTHA.

11:58.639 --> 12:00.841
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

12:00.841 --> 12:03.844
WELL, I AM HERE
TO DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL.

12:03.844 --> 12:04.925

12:09.970 --> 12:11.211

I HAVE A CAR.

12:14.214 --> 12:15.455
AND IT WORKS,
SO‐‐

12:15.455 --> 12:18.218
SASHA, I'VE DECIDED
IT'S TIME

12:18.218 --> 12:19.259
TO TAKE
THIS THING PUBLIC.

12:19.259 --> 12:20.901
<i>YOU, ME, US.</i>

12:20.901 --> 12:22.743
LIKE WE'RE FACEBOOK?

12:22.743 --> 12:24.384

NORMAL COUPLES.

12:24.384 --> 12:25.946
THEY HANG OUT TOGETHER.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.388
THEY DRIVE PLACES TOGETHER.
PEOPLE KNOW THEY'RE TOGETHER.

12:28.388 --> 12:30.390
‐ OKAY.
‐ <i>I'M GONNA MAKE IT</i>
<i>EASY ON YOU.</i>

12:30.390 --> 12:32.673

12:34.474 --> 12:36.236
WANT TO SAY
GOOD‐BYE TO YOUR PLANT?

12:38.078 --> 12:39.079
( sighs )

12:39.079 --> 12:40.080
SEE YOU, RALPH.

12:44.084 --> 12:45.646
AND WE'RE GONNA
GO TO SCHOOL

12:45.646 --> 12:47.327
AND WALK UP
THE STEPS TOGETHER.

12:47.327 --> 12:49.169
‐ DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
‐ VAGUELY.

12:51.131 --> 12:52.893
ACCEPT IT.
ACCEPT IT.

12:52.893 --> 12:54.134

12:54.134 --> 12:55.696

OF AFFECTION LATER.

12:57.137 --> 12:58.859
<i>( bell rings )</i>

13:00.220 --> 13:02.062

13:03.063 --> 13:04.464
HEY, HOW WAS CLASS?

13:04.464 --> 13:06.226
BIG FUN WITH

WHAT'S UP?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.389
WELL, I FIGURED
SINCE DRIVING TO SCHOOL

13:09.389 --> 13:11.151
AND WALKING UP
THE STEPS WENT SO WELL,

13:11.151 --> 13:12.833
THAT WE SHOULD
TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.994
WHAT'S A STEP FURTHER?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.235
‐ LUNCH.
‐ WHAT?

13:15.235 --> 13:17.838
THESE REALLY ARE NOT
SUPER FOREIGN CONCEPTS.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.999
I EAT WITH
MY FRIENDS.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.240
SO WE'LL
EAT AS A GROUP.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.642
I LIKE YOUR FRIENDS.

13:21.642 --> 13:23.724
I THINK.
IF THEY'RE AS
NICE AS RALPH.

13:23.724 --> 13:25.566
YOU'RE NORTH QUAD.
WE'RE SOUTH QUAD.

13:25.566 --> 13:27.087
I'LL GET A PASSPORT.

13:27.087 --> 13:29.810
ARE WE DOING
THE ARM THING AGAIN?

13:29.810 --> 13:31.371
I'D EXPECT IT.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.299

14:26.346 --> 14:28.428
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ <i>THIS WAS HIS IDEA.</i>

14:28.428 --> 14:30.070

MATING RITUAL.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.311
IS HE YOUR
BOYFRIEND NOW?

14:31.311 --> 14:32.633
I GUESS.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.074
SO IT'S
"OFFICIAL" OFFICIAL?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.395
THERE'S BEEN NO FORMAL
ANNOUNCEMENT IN THE PRESS,

14:35.395 --> 14:36.276
BUT YES,
IT'S OFFICIAL.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.277

‐ I DO NOT.
‐ <i>THE LAST TIME I</i>
<i>ASKED YOU ABOUT A BOY</i>

14:44.124 --> 14:46.647
IT WAS IN THE THIRD GRADE,
AND IT WAS ABOUT JIMMY KUWOLSKI.

14:46.647 --> 14:48.328
THE SKI MAN.

14:48.328 --> 14:49.650
YOU PUNCHED ME.
I GOT A BRUISE.

14:49.650 --> 14:51.812
DIDN'T LIKE TALKING
ABOUT THE SKI MAN.

14:51.812 --> 14:53.213
YOU GUYS KNEW
ROMAN WAS AROUND.

14:53.213 --> 14:54.254
YOU'VE SEEN ME
TEXTING HIM.

14:54.254 --> 14:55.375
MYSTERIOUSLY.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.817
YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
SAID HIS NAME.

14:56.817 --> 14:58.378
WELL, I'M SAYING IT NOW.

14:58.378 --> 15:00.220
‐ ROMAN.

DO ABOUT LUNCH?

15:00.220 --> 15:02.302
‐ WE EAT IT.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.944
‐ WE HAVE RULES.
‐ WE DON'T HAVE RULES.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.066
WE HAVE CUSTOMS.
AND CUSTOMS CHANGE.

15:06.066 --> 15:07.307
I NEVER LET JOSH
EAT WITH US,

15:07.307 --> 15:08.509
AND JOSH AND I WERE
TOGETHER EIGHT YEARS.

15:08.509 --> 15:10.310
HE WORKED IN THE CAFETERIA,
SO HE COULDN'T.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.712
I MISS THOSE
FREE BROWNIES.

15:11.712 --> 15:13.113
<i>CLIMB ABOARD</i>
<i>THE TRAIN, GIRLS.</i>

15:13.113 --> 15:14.635
COME ON.
IT'S LEAVING THE STATION.

15:14.635 --> 15:17.077
FINE. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THOUGH.

15:17.077 --> 15:18.398
WE CAN TALK
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

15:18.398 --> 15:19.840
‐ RIGHT?
‐ ALREADY ASLEEP.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.602
EVEN HE DOESN'T
TALK ABOUT BASKETBALL.

15:21.602 --> 15:23.483
OKAY, BUT WE CAN'T
TALK ABOUT WHAT WE
TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY.

15:23.483 --> 15:25.325
YEAH, THAT WOULD
BE EMBARRASSING.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.087
OKAY, SO WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT YESTERDAY

15:27.087 --> 15:29.369
OR BASKETBALL, BUT WE CAN FIND
OTHER THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.533
BRING HIM OVER.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.534
( whistles )

15:39.059 --> 15:40.621
( clears throat )

15:46.426 --> 15:48.509
SO, IS WILT CHAMBERLAIN
STILL ALIVE?

15:59.439 --> 16:02.523
THESE ARE THE THEATER'S
POTENTIAL TAX BENEFITS
FOR THE ENTIRE TOWN?

16:02.523 --> 16:04.444
‐ IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
‐ IT'S WHAT I CAME UP WITH.

16:04.444 --> 16:06.366
YOU FIGURED IN
FLOWER SHOPS,
RESTAURANTS,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.849
‐ PARKING LOTS?
‐ SOUVENIR VENDORS,
GAS STATIONS, MINI‐MARTS.

16:08.849 --> 16:10.450
‐ POT DEALERS?
‐ WHAT?

16:10.450 --> 16:12.292
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO ARE GOING TO
WANT TO SPARK UP

16:12.292 --> 16:13.854
BEFORE THE BALLET.
PUT IT IN.

16:13.854 --> 16:15.576
I'M DEFINITELY NOT
PUTTING THAT IN.

16:15.576 --> 16:17.417
THEN CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND I'LL PUT IT IN FOR YOU.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.019
YOU KNOW POT'S
ONLY LEGAL

16:19.019 --> 16:20.260
WITH A DOCTOR'S
PRESCRIPTION, RIGHT?

16:20.260 --> 16:21.582
SO, HAVE A PANIC ATTACK.

16:21.582 --> 16:22.623
FAKE A MIGRAINE.

16:22.623 --> 16:24.264
I WON'T NEED TO
FAKE ONE IN A MINUTE.

16:24.264 --> 16:25.826
YOU WEAR GLASSES,
USE THAT.

16:25.826 --> 16:27.427
Michelle:
<i>LEAVE ERIC ALONE, MILLY!</i>

16:27.427 --> 16:29.830
JUST FOCUS ON
YOUR OWN THING.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.272
JAYDEN.
ARE YOU IN YET?

16:32.272 --> 16:33.473
I'M INTO SAM'S.

16:33.473 --> 16:35.676
DOPEY CHICK'S PASSWORD
WAS HER CAT'S NAME.

16:35.676 --> 16:37.277
SUPER EASY HACK.

16:37.277 --> 16:38.839
Michelle: <i>DID HE SAY HACK?</i>
<i>ARE YOU GUYS HACKING?</i>

16:38.839 --> 16:40.841
THIS SAL GUY'S DESKTOP
HAS GOT SOME SORT OF

16:40.841 --> 16:42.122
ADVANCED FIREWALL.

16:42.122 --> 16:43.443
I GOTTA GO THROUGH
THE LOCAL MAINFRAME,

16:43.443 --> 16:44.845
BUT I'M ALMOST IN.

16:44.845 --> 16:46.206
Michelle: <i>THERE SHOULD BE</i>
<i>NO HACKING GOING ON.</i>

16:46.206 --> 16:47.768
<i>REBEKAH BROOKS.</i>
<i>REBEKAH BROOKS.</i>

16:47.768 --> 16:49.930
IT'S JUST INFORMATION
GATHERING, MICHELLE.

16:49.930 --> 16:52.132
I HAVE A STACK OF FILES
ON EVERY PERSON IN THIS TOWN.

16:52.132 --> 16:53.453
TRUST ME,
IT COMES IN HANDY.

16:53.453 --> 16:54.535
Michelle: <i>DO YOU HAVE</i>
<i>A FILE ON ME?</i>

16:54.535 --> 16:56.056
I BROUGHT THE NECKLACES
YOU ASKED FOR.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.658
BOLD, BEADED, SOMETHING
HILLARY CLINTON WOULD WEAR

16:57.658 --> 16:59.900
‐ TO BANGLADESH.
‐ SHE MAKES KILLER
BEAD CHOICES.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.902
‐ GO WITH BLACK.
‐ <i>THERE'S SO MANY BUTTONS.</i>

17:01.902 --> 17:03.263
<i>AND EVERY TIME</i>
<i>I BUTTON A BUTTON,</i>

17:03.263 --> 17:04.424
<i>THERE'S ANOTHER</i>
<i>BUTTON TO BUTTON.</i>

17:04.424 --> 17:06.026
MICHELLE, JUST COME
OUT HERE PLEASE.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.831
( sighs )

17:11.832 --> 17:13.554
AND I WAS EXPECTING
THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.559
‐ GET THAT AWAY FROM ME.
‐ NOPE, STAND STILL.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.924
I COULD PLAY WITH
THE CROTCH A LITTLE.

17:23.924 --> 17:25.165
BEST OFFER ALL DAY.

17:25.165 --> 17:26.727
IT'S NOT THE CROTCH.

17:26.727 --> 17:28.448
GUYS, I'M NOT REALLY
A PANTSUIT KIND OF GAL.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.050
HOW ABOUT A DRESS?

17:30.050 --> 17:31.532
NO. IT HAS TO
BE A PANTSUIT.

17:31.532 --> 17:33.854
THERE IS NOTHING MORE
INTIMIDATING THAN A PANTSUIT.

17:33.854 --> 17:35.856
WE COULD TRY TO DO
SOME COLOR BLOCKING
ON IT.

17:35.856 --> 17:38.378
<i>UNLESS COLOR BLOCKING</i>
<i>IS CODE FOR DESTROY,</i>
<i>IT WON'T HELP.</i>

17:39.780 --> 17:41.582
‐ <i>( cellphone ringing )</i>
‐ THAT'S SAL.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.823
HE'S CALLING
FROM HIS BATHROOM.

17:42.823 --> 17:44.104
THANKS, JAYDEN.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.826
HEY THERE, SAL.

17:45.826 --> 17:48.428
NO, I'M SORRY.
I KNOW THE CHANGE WAS ABRUPT,

17:48.428 --> 17:50.991
BUT I'M OUT OF TOWN
NEXT WEEK AND THIS IS
SO IMPORTANT TO US,

17:50.991 --> 17:52.432
YOU UNDERSTAND?

17:52.432 --> 17:54.434
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL SUPPLY SOME SNACKS,

17:54.434 --> 17:56.837
MAKE IT MORE LIKE
A PARTY THAN A MEETING.

17:56.837 --> 17:59.840
YES. AND TO YOU
AND YOURS, SAL.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.762
‐ <i>( phone beeps )</i>
‐ MICHELLE, HOW LONG
DOES IT TAKE

18:01.762 --> 18:03.604
‐ TO PUT ON A JACKET?!
‐ <i>IT'S ON.</i>

18:03.604 --> 18:05.606
<i>I'M JUST SAD.</i>

18:10.450 --> 18:11.491
WE'RE GONNA NEED
BIGGER BEADS.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.014
<i>TRULY,</i>

18:14.014 --> 18:15.215
SHOW ME WHERE YOU KEEP
YOUR JUMBO BEADS.

18:15.215 --> 18:16.376
<i>JUMBO BEADS?</i>

18:16.376 --> 18:17.457
I LOVE JUMBO BEADS.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.420
<i>TALIA, SAVE ME!</i>

18:20.420 --> 18:22.663
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

18:22.663 --> 18:24.264
( groans )

18:26.426 --> 18:28.268
‐ WHAT IS THIS?
‐ IT'S A PANTSUIT.

18:28.268 --> 18:30.270
I KNOW WHAT IT IS,
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY

18:30.270 --> 18:31.632
IT'S WRAPPED
AROUND YOUR BODY.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.994
WE'RE HAVING A PREEMPTIVE
MEETING WITH THE TOWN ELDERS

18:33.994 --> 18:35.836
ABOUT OUR AMPHITHEATER.
AND APPARENTLY,

18:35.836 --> 18:37.437
IF I WEAR THIS,
THEY WON'T GET US
LIKE THEY GOT THE EDGE.

18:37.437 --> 18:39.600
‐ BECAUSE IT'S WEAPONIZED?
‐ AND THERE'S BEADS.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.282
‐ I MISSED YOU.
‐ I MISSED YOU TOO.

18:42.282 --> 18:43.844
WHAT'S WITH
"THE SOCIAL NETWORK" OVER HERE?

18:43.844 --> 18:45.285
OH, THIS IS
OUR SUPER TEAM.

18:45.285 --> 18:46.847
THAT'S ACCOUNTING,
THAT'S OUR HACKER.

18:46.847 --> 18:48.609
I DON'T KNOW THOSE GUYS,
BUT THEY FREAK ME OUT.

18:48.609 --> 18:50.210
AND THIS IS OUR BOARD ROOM.
HAVE A SEAT.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.612
‐ Truly: <i>DON'T SIT.</i>
‐ SORRY, TRULY.

18:51.612 --> 18:53.013
TRULY, HEY GIRL.

18:53.013 --> 18:54.454
‐ <i>HEY, GIRL.</i>
‐ LOVE THE HAIR.

18:54.454 --> 18:56.617
<i>OH THANKS,</i>
<i>IT'S JUST A NEW THING.</i>

18:56.617 --> 18:58.458
‐ TALK TO ME.
‐ WHAT?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.541
WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT?
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DROVE
ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE

19:00.541 --> 19:02.823
WITH THIS MYSTERIOUS
BIG NEWS OF YOURS.
I NEED TO KNOW. SPILL.

19:02.823 --> 19:05.265
OKAY.
RICK PROPOSED.

19:05.265 --> 19:06.867
( gasps )
WHOA, REALLY?

19:06.867 --> 19:08.549
DID HE GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE?
'CAUSE THAT CAN BE
FATAL AT HIS AGE.

19:08.549 --> 19:09.750
HE DID NOT GET
DOWN ON ONE KNEE,

19:09.750 --> 19:11.632
BUT HE DID SPELL IT OUT
WITH ROSE PETALS.

19:11.632 --> 19:12.753
WOW!
WHAT DID YOU SAY

19:12.753 --> 19:14.515
AFTER, YOU KNOW,
YOU STOPPED THROWING UP?

19:14.515 --> 19:16.517
‐ NOTHING YET.
‐ WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA SAY?

19:16.517 --> 19:18.438
WELL,
AS I WAS LEAVING

19:18.438 --> 19:19.920
AND I'M KISSING
MY RICKY GOOD‐BYE

19:19.920 --> 19:21.441
AND HE WAS ALL
SWEET AND ADORABLE,

19:21.441 --> 19:23.043
I WAS LIKE,
"DEFINITE YES."

19:23.043 --> 19:24.605
‐ YAY.
‐ THEN I STOPPED
AT PEGGY SUE'S

19:24.605 --> 19:26.006
ON THE I‐15
AND THERE WAS THIS TABLE

19:26.006 --> 19:27.768
OF INCREDIBLY HOT GUYS
RIGHT NEXT TO ME,

19:27.768 --> 19:28.849
SO IT WAS "NO."

19:28.849 --> 19:30.210
OH.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.451
THEN I STOPPED AT
A REALLY CUTE STORE

19:31.451 --> 19:33.293
IN CAMBRIA.
CREDIT CARD GOT DECLINED,

19:33.293 --> 19:35.215
SO IT WAS "YES" AGAIN.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.456
THEN I GOT A FLAT TIRE,

19:36.456 --> 19:38.539
THIS GUY PULLS OVER,
CHANGES IT FOR ME,

19:38.539 --> 19:40.500
VERY CUTE.
VERY JON HAMM.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.862
I LIKE HAMM.

19:41.862 --> 19:43.263
‐ SO... RIGHT?
‐ NO.

19:43.263 --> 19:44.825
THEN I DROVE
FOR ANOTHER HOUR,

19:44.825 --> 19:46.426
REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

19:46.426 --> 19:48.428
‐ AND...
‐ I'M HEARING
A DRUMROLL.

19:48.428 --> 19:51.071
( gasps )
IT'S A YES.

19:51.071 --> 19:52.432
BIG SHINY YES.

19:52.432 --> 19:53.834
OH, I'M SO
HAPPY FOR YOU.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.435
<i>CONGRATULATIONS.</i>

19:55.435 --> 19:57.277
THANKS, TRULES.

19:57.277 --> 19:58.839
SO, DRINKS
AND THEN DRINKS?

19:58.839 --> 20:00.480
YOU KNOW MY RULE.
ONE DRINK PER KARAT.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.282
SO WE'RE GETTING
WASTED TONIGHT.

20:02.282 --> 20:03.844
NOT IN THE PANTSUIT,
YOU'RE NOT.

20:17.457 --> 20:19.540
I SWEAR IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS.

20:19.540 --> 20:21.461
‐ WHAT, YOUR SANDWICH?
‐ NO, THIS.

20:21.461 --> 20:23.504
TALK.
PLEASE TALK.

20:23.504 --> 20:24.825
<i>ABOUT WHATEVER YOU WANT.</i>
<i>I BEG YOU.</i>

20:24.825 --> 20:26.346
BUT WE DON'T
KNOW BASKETBALL.

20:26.346 --> 20:27.828
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT BASKETBALL.

20:27.828 --> 20:29.630
Ginny: <i>OKAY, FINE.</i>
<i>LET'S TALK.</i>

20:29.630 --> 20:31.952
YOU KNOW, I WAS REWATCHING
"THE NOTEBOOK" THE OTHER DAY,

20:31.952 --> 20:33.433
AND I CAME UP WITH
A WHOLE NEW THEORY.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.715
ANYTHING BUT
"THE NOTEBOOK."

20:34.715 --> 20:36.757
<i>WELL, I WATCHED</i>
<i>"THE VOW" THE OTHER NIGHT,</i>

20:36.757 --> 20:38.519
AND I COULDN'T
FIGURE OUT WHY‐‐

20:38.519 --> 20:41.602
ALL RACHEL McADAMS
MOVIES ARE OFF THE TABLE.

20:41.602 --> 20:43.443
‐ BOO.
‐ CARL. WHAT'S WRONG?

20:43.443 --> 20:45.085
I THOUGHT YOUR LUNCHES
WERE AN ALL GIRL THING.

20:45.085 --> 20:46.567
<i>THEY WERE.</i>

20:46.567 --> 20:48.529
‐ SASHA CHANGED IT.
‐ <i>I DIDN'T CHANGE IT.</i>

20:48.529 --> 20:49.850
ROMAN CHANGED IT.

20:49.850 --> 20:50.891
HEY, I'M ROMAN.

20:50.891 --> 20:52.452
CARL.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.334
<i>I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD</i>
<i>JUST CHANGE THE RULES.</i>

20:54.334 --> 20:56.296
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD
JUST CHANGE THEM EITHER.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.618
THERE WERE
NEVER RULES.

20:57.618 --> 21:00.140
WELL, IF THERE ARE NO RULES,
I'M SITTING HERE.

21:02.823 --> 21:04.785
DON'T MIND ME.
JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

21:04.785 --> 21:05.986
GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT.

21:09.429 --> 21:11.271
WHAT THE HELL?

21:11.271 --> 21:12.553
WHATEVER.

21:12.553 --> 21:15.435
JUST SAW THESE GUYS HERE,
SO I FIGURED "HEY."

21:15.435 --> 21:17.077
IMPECCABLE LOGIC.

21:17.077 --> 21:18.839
GREAT. SO THIS IS
A COUPLES' TABLE NOW.

21:18.839 --> 21:21.281
‐ IS THAT WAS THIS IS?
‐ DEZ AND I ARE NOT A COUPLE.

21:21.281 --> 21:24.284
YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'VE EVEN KISSED
OR ANYTHING.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.806
YOU WANT TO KISS?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.608
YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS
EVERYONE IS HOOKING UP,

21:27.608 --> 21:29.289
I MIGHT AS WELL GO
AND ASK FRANKIE OVER.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.370
HOW ABOUT THAT?

21:32.573 --> 21:33.854
<i>I'LL JUST ASK HIM OVER.</i>

21:33.854 --> 21:35.455
<i>HELLO?</i>

21:35.455 --> 21:37.538
YOU TURN INTO A PUDDLE
WHENEVER YOU'RE AROUND HIM.

21:37.538 --> 21:38.979
I DO NOT.

21:38.979 --> 21:40.701
NO, YOU GET LIQUID‐Y
PRETTY QUICK.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.472
<i>( distant</i>

22:30.911 --> 22:32.513
OKAY, OKAY.
A LITTLE BIT FASTER, BRAD.

22:32.513 --> 22:33.674
MORE RAMONES, DUDE.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.359
ALL RIGHT,
A LITTLE BIT FASTER.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.921
OKAY.

22:40.921 --> 22:43.924
‐ <i>( piano plays faster )</i>
‐ ( babbling with beat )

22:46.527 --> 22:47.928
OKAY, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU.

22:47.928 --> 22:49.449
NICE WORK.

22:49.449 --> 22:50.971
NO NO NO NO‐‐
NO NEED FOR FORMALITIES.

22:50.971 --> 22:52.412
MOVE IT. MOVE IT.

22:52.412 --> 22:53.934
CLAP WHILE YOU'RE WALKING.
CLAP WHILE YOU'RE WALKING.

22:55.776 --> 22:56.937
I NEED
MY DANCE BAG.

22:56.937 --> 22:58.098
THERE YOU GO.
MOVE IT.

22:58.098 --> 22:59.620
MAMA'S GOT A PANTSUIT
TO GET INTO.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.381
HEY STRAGGLERS,
VAMOOSE.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.025
( murmurs )

23:05.025 --> 23:06.947
HEY, DO YOU GUYS WANT TO COME
SEE ME AT DERBY TONIGHT?

23:06.947 --> 23:08.028
I CAN GET COMPS.

23:08.028 --> 23:09.590
‐ YEAH, I'LL GO.
‐ SASHA, YOU IN?

23:09.590 --> 23:11.592
CAN'T TAKE
THE TOILETS.

23:11.592 --> 23:13.033
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

23:13.033 --> 23:15.195
‐ ME?
‐ YEAH, WANT TO BE MY
CHEERLEADER TONIGHT?

23:15.195 --> 23:17.077
NO, I CAN'T.

23:17.077 --> 23:18.078
HOMEWORK.

23:18.078 --> 23:19.520
Michelle: <i>ALL RIGHT, 5:00.</i>

23:19.520 --> 23:22.002
<i>THE STUDIO'S OFFICIALLY</i>
<i>A "NO KID" ZONE.</i>

23:22.002 --> 23:24.525
<i>ANYTHING OR ANYONE UP THERE</i>
<i>IS GOING OUT THE WINDOW</i>

23:24.525 --> 23:26.326
<i>IF THEY'RE NOT OUT</i>
<i>IN 30 SECONDS.</i>

23:29.329 --> 23:31.732
‐ DO YOU WANT A RIDE?
‐ I'M GONNA WALK.

23:31.732 --> 23:33.333
TO EACH HIS OWN.

23:41.822 --> 23:43.824
( indistinct chattering )

23:52.753 --> 23:53.914
( sighs )

23:53.914 --> 23:55.756
I FEEL VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.758
YOU LOOK TERRIFYING.

23:57.758 --> 23:59.079
OH.

23:59.079 --> 24:02.322
WELL, THANKS.

24:02.322 --> 24:04.044
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
OVER THERE?

24:04.044 --> 24:05.766
THEY'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE FACT

24:05.766 --> 24:07.728
THAT I PROMISED SNACKS
AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO
BE HERE.

24:07.728 --> 24:08.929
REALLY?
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

24:08.929 --> 24:12.332
MICHELLE, PLEASE.
I OWN PROPERTY.

24:12.332 --> 24:14.935
OKAY, WE'VE LET THEM
STEW LONG ENOUGH.

24:14.935 --> 24:17.938
LET'S GET THIS
SHOW ON THE ROAD.

24:17.938 --> 24:20.340
HELLO, EVERYONE.

24:20.340 --> 24:23.143
I WANT TO THANK
YOU ALL FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

24:23.143 --> 24:25.345
WE ARE SO GRATEFUL
THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO

24:25.345 --> 24:27.347
JUGGLE YOUR SCHEDULES
AROUND LIKE THIS.

24:27.347 --> 24:29.870
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE LOTS
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY.

24:29.870 --> 24:30.911
YEAH, YOU SAID

24:30.911 --> 24:31.952
THERE WAS GONNA BE SNACKS.

24:31.952 --> 24:33.554
<i>DID I?</i>

24:33.554 --> 24:34.915
MY GOODNESS, SAL.
APOLOGIES.

24:34.915 --> 24:36.757
I HAVE NO
MEMORY OF THAT.

24:36.757 --> 24:37.758
SHOULD I SEND
SOMEONE TO THE STORE

24:37.758 --> 24:39.319
TO GET US
SOME CRUDITES?

24:39.319 --> 24:40.801
‐ NO.
‐ <i>OKAY THEN.</i>

24:40.801 --> 24:42.082
WHY DON'T WE JUST
GET GOING THEN?

24:42.082 --> 24:43.924
I SEE YOU BROUGHT
EASELS.

24:43.924 --> 24:45.766
EASELS MEAN
PRESENTATIONS.

24:45.766 --> 24:47.688
SO SINCE IT SEEMS
LIKE YOU HAVE THINGS

24:47.688 --> 24:48.929
YOU WANT TO PRESENT,

24:48.929 --> 24:50.691
I CEDE THE FLOOR TO YOU.

24:56.617 --> 24:58.579
OH, I CAN SIT NOW?
GREAT.

24:58.579 --> 25:00.621
Joe: <i>I CAN'T FIND</i>
<i>THE PERMITS FOLDER.</i>
<i>DO YOU HAVE THE PERMITS FOLDER?</i>

25:00.621 --> 25:01.822
Stephanie:
<i>I PUT IT OVER THERE.</i>

25:01.822 --> 25:04.024
I DIDN'T EAT
BECAUSE SHE SAID SNACKS.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.265
NONE OF US DID.

25:05.265 --> 25:06.947
CRUDITES IS NOT SNACKS.

25:06.947 --> 25:08.789
I CAN'T EAT
ANYTHING RAW EVER.

25:08.789 --> 25:10.350
‐ IT'S DEATH.
‐ <i>I HATE KALE.</i>

25:10.350 --> 25:12.272
Sal: <i>KALE.</i>
<i>KALE IS TERRIBLE.</i>

25:12.272 --> 25:14.675
I GOT THE FOLDER.
OKAY, WE'RE READY.

25:14.675 --> 25:15.996
( sighs )

25:15.996 --> 25:17.037
Michelle: <i>WHY IS HE</i>
<i>LOOKING AT MY BEADS?</i>

25:17.037 --> 25:18.519
THEY LOOK LIKE
MEATBALLS.

25:18.519 --> 25:20.601
Sam: <i>SORRY, WE WERE</i>
<i>A LITTLE DISORGANIZED.</i>

25:20.601 --> 25:23.323
OKAY, SO WE HAVE
LOOKED THROUGH
ALL OF YOUR PAPERS

25:23.323 --> 25:24.685
AND AS FAR AS
WE CAN SEE,

25:24.685 --> 25:25.926
EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE IN ORDER.

25:25.926 --> 25:28.609
OH, GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

25:28.609 --> 25:29.930
MAYBE THIS IS GOING TO BE
EASIER THAN YOU THOUGHT.

25:29.930 --> 25:31.932
SO, THE ONLY THING
LEFT TO DISCUSS

25:31.932 --> 25:33.934
IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACT

25:33.934 --> 25:35.576
THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION
WILL HAVE ON OUR COMMUNITY.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.057
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

25:37.057 --> 25:41.341
THIS IS A PHOTOGRAPH
OF YOUR LAND IN 1937.

25:41.341 --> 25:43.343
NOTICE ALL THE TREES.

25:43.343 --> 25:47.187
TREES THAT CURRENTLY
ARE NO LONGER THERE.

25:47.187 --> 25:48.188
WHERE DID THEY GO?

25:48.188 --> 25:50.110
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

25:50.110 --> 25:52.032
YOU SHOULD.
YOU'RE WEARING THE PANTSUIT.

25:52.032 --> 25:53.433
Sal: <i>BY OUR ESTIMATION,</i>

25:53.433 --> 25:56.076
YOU'RE PLANNING ON FELLING
AT LEAST EIGHT MORE TREES.

25:56.076 --> 25:57.758
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
WE HAVE NO PLANS

25:57.758 --> 25:59.920
TO FELL ANY TREES.
I THINK.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.322
I ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT FELLING A TREE WOULD BE.

26:02.322 --> 26:03.323
CUTTING IT DOWN.

26:03.323 --> 26:04.605
OH, THEN YEAH.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.046
WE'RE GONNA FELL
A BUNCH OF TREES.

26:06.046 --> 26:08.248
‐ HA!
‐ WE HAVE TO MAKE
ROOM FOR THE STAGE.

26:08.248 --> 26:09.930
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE SQUIRRELS?

26:09.930 --> 26:11.371
‐ THE‐‐
‐ SQUIRRELS LIVE IN TREES.

26:11.371 --> 26:13.213
YOU TAKE OUT THE TREES,
YOU ARE DISPLACING
THE SQUIRRELS.

26:13.213 --> 26:14.975
WHERE ARE THEY
GOING TO GO?

26:14.975 --> 26:16.697
WELL, CAN'T THEY JUST
MOVE TO ANOTHER TREE?

26:16.697 --> 26:18.498
‐ WOW.
‐ HEARTLESS.

26:18.498 --> 26:20.340
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
A TAFTPOKIRIP.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.342
Sam: <i>JUST MOVE TO</i>
<i>ANOTHER TREE.</i>

26:22.342 --> 26:24.104
WHAT IF YOU STORED
YOUR NUTS IN A TREE

26:24.104 --> 26:25.626
AND THEN YOU
WENT OUT ONE DAY,
YOU CAME BACK

26:25.626 --> 26:26.907
AND POOF,
THAT TREE WAS GONE?

26:26.907 --> 26:28.228
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

26:28.228 --> 26:29.670
<i>YOU'RE A SQUIRREL.</i>
<i>WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?</i>

26:29.670 --> 26:31.111
SUE?
GO TO SQUIRREL COURT?

26:31.111 --> 26:33.153
SAY "SOME LADY
TOOK MY NUTS"?

26:33.153 --> 26:35.956
YEAH YEAH.
I REALLY AM HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

26:35.956 --> 26:37.397
<i>WHAT IF THE TREE</i>
<i>YOU CUT DOWN</i>

26:37.397 --> 26:39.920
WAS THE TREE THAT
THAT SQUIRREL RAISED
HIS KIDS IN?

26:39.920 --> 26:41.642
<i>OR HE WAS RAISED IN?</i>

26:41.642 --> 26:44.004
YES, WHAT IF IT WAS
HIS CHILDHOOD TREE?

26:44.004 --> 26:45.405
WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO HIM?

26:45.405 --> 26:47.768
‐ OR HER.
‐ IT ABSOLUTELY
COULD BE A HER.

26:47.768 --> 26:49.930
YOU'RE GOING TO SEND SOME
POOR SINGLE MOTHER SQUIRREL

26:49.930 --> 26:51.932
OUT INTO THE WILD
TO FIND ANOTHER TREE?

26:51.932 --> 26:54.134
WHEN DID SHE BECOME
A SINGLE MOTHER SQUIRREL?

26:54.134 --> 26:57.457
WHEN YOU TOOK DOWN THE TREE
HER HUSBAND WAS SLEEPING IN.

26:57.457 --> 26:58.939
WELL, I GUESS I WOULD SAY

26:58.939 --> 27:00.781
"MRS. SQUIRREL,
IF YOUR HUSBAND IS JUST

27:00.781 --> 27:02.182
LAYING AROUND
THE TREE ALL DAY

27:02.182 --> 27:03.343
WHILE YOU'RE OUT
SLAVING AWAY

27:03.343 --> 27:04.625
TO PUT NUTS ON THE TABLE,

27:04.625 --> 27:06.026
THEN YOU DODGED
A BULLET, MY FRIEND."

27:06.026 --> 27:07.788
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU?

27:07.788 --> 27:09.029
NO, I'M NOT.
SORRY.

27:09.029 --> 27:11.231
ALL YOU PANTSUIT
WEARERS ARE THE SAME.

27:11.231 --> 27:13.033
NOT CONCERNED WITH
ANYONE BUT YOURSELF.

27:13.033 --> 27:14.715
YOU KNOW, WHEN I
HEARD ABOUT THE EDGE,

27:14.715 --> 27:16.356
I THOUGHT "THIS STORY
CAN'T BE TRUE.

27:16.356 --> 27:17.718
THERE MUST BE MORE
TO IT THAN THAT,"

27:17.718 --> 27:20.320
BUT CLEARLY
IT'S COMPLETELY TRUE.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.962
<i>NO ONE COMES INTO</i>
<i>THIS COMMUNITY</i>

27:21.962 --> 27:23.764
AND DOES WHATEVER
THE HELL THEY WANT.

27:23.764 --> 27:25.926
YEAH, ESPECIALLY
NOT AFTER "POP."

27:25.926 --> 27:28.048
I PAID FULL PRICE
FOR THAT TURKEY.

27:28.048 --> 27:29.329
LOOK, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO DO SOMETHING NICE

27:29.329 --> 27:30.651
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

27:30.651 --> 27:33.534
BRING IN SOMETHING NEW
AND ARTISTIC TO THIS PLACE.

27:33.534 --> 27:34.655
WHAT A SNOB.

27:34.655 --> 27:36.336
WE DON'T NEED YOU
TO ENLIGHTEN US.

27:36.336 --> 27:38.338
WE HAVE TWO
COMMUNITY THEATERS

27:38.338 --> 27:40.861
AND A COLOR ME MINE.
WE'RE DONE.

27:40.861 --> 27:42.543
‐ THANK YOU.
‐ AND WE'D LIKE OUR CHEESE.

27:42.543 --> 27:44.344
‐ ( loud, overlapping chatter )
‐ REALLY? NO NO NO WAIT.

27:44.344 --> 27:47.107
YOU HAVEN'T‐‐
YOU ONLY HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THE SQUIRRELS

27:47.107 --> 27:49.349
AND TREES
AND COLOR ME MINE.

27:49.349 --> 27:52.953
<i>( arguing continues )</i>

27:52.953 --> 27:55.556
OKAY, EVERYONE.

27:55.556 --> 27:57.958
THESE PANTS ARE SUPPOSED
TO CUT ME LIKE THAT.

28:00.921 --> 28:02.923
SORRY.

28:02.923 --> 28:04.765
OKAY.

28:04.765 --> 28:07.327
WELL, I THINK
WE'VE...

28:07.327 --> 28:10.330
HEARD ALL OF
YOUR CONCERNS.

28:11.772 --> 28:14.775
SEEN YOUR PRESENTATIONS.

28:14.775 --> 28:16.777
NOW...

28:16.777 --> 28:18.338
LET ME TELL YOU ALL

28:18.338 --> 28:19.940
HOW THIS IS
GONNA GO DOWN.

28:21.501 --> 28:24.024
OH GOD.
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE ARE YOU?

28:24.024 --> 28:25.145
COME ON.
COME ON.

28:25.145 --> 28:26.587
‐ LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?
‐ AH! OH MY GOD.

28:26.587 --> 28:28.188
YOU SPOOKED ME.
DON'T SPOOK ME.

28:28.188 --> 28:29.349
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

28:29.349 --> 28:31.792
SORRY, IT'S JUST
YOU SPOOKED ME.

28:31.792 --> 28:32.953
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:32.953 --> 28:34.114
HOMEWORK.
IT'S QUIET HERE.

28:34.114 --> 28:35.275
THIS?
THIS IS QUIET?

28:35.275 --> 28:36.957
THERE ARE SEVERAL
ADULTS YELLING DOWNSTAIRS.

28:36.957 --> 28:38.599
MY MOM JUST FOUND OUT
THAT FAYE MENDELSON

28:38.599 --> 28:40.040
AND MY DAD ARE
TRYING TO CONCEIVE.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.922
BELIEVE ME,
IT'S MUCH MORE
QUIET HERE.

28:41.922 --> 28:43.483
‐ I'M SORRY.
‐ PAR FOR THE COURSE.

28:43.483 --> 28:45.766
WELL, GINNY,
HERE'S WHAT I'VE
LEARNED TONIGHT.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.327
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A MEETING,
HAVE SNACKS AT THAT MEETING.

28:47.327 --> 28:49.049
YOU SHOULD BE
WRITING THIS DOWN.

28:49.049 --> 28:51.091
BECAUSE WITHOUT SNACKS,
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO WITH THEIR HANDS

28:51.091 --> 28:53.253
AND THEY GET GRUMPY.
SNACKS. GINNY, SNACKS.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.775
SNACKS.

28:54.775 --> 28:56.937
GOOD. NOW, HAVE YOU
SEEN A JACKET THAT
LOOKS LIKE THIS ONE

28:56.937 --> 28:58.498
BUT WITHOUT ALL
THE SWEAT STAINS?

28:58.498 --> 28:59.780
NO. BUT I'LL
HELP YOU LOOK.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.503
TRULY SAID SHE'D
LEAVE ME A SPARE
SOMEWHERE.

29:02.503 --> 29:04.104
I'VE JUST BEEN SOAKING
THROUGH THIS ALL NIGHT.

29:04.104 --> 29:07.107
I DON'T THINK I'M CUT OUT
FOR LEGAL ISSUES AND PANTSUITS.

29:07.107 --> 29:09.349
I WORE MY FIRST PANTSUIT
WHEN I WAS NINE.

29:09.349 --> 29:11.672
MY MOM WAS SELLING A HOUSE
USING THE BABY ANGLE.

29:11.672 --> 29:13.193
SO I WAS BASICALLY
BORN IN A PANTSUIT.

29:13.193 --> 29:14.194
DRESS GUARDS
ARE MY SAVIOR.

29:14.194 --> 29:15.435
DRESS GUARDS.
BUT HONESTLY,

29:15.435 --> 29:16.957
THEY'D HAVE TO BE
INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH.

29:16.957 --> 29:18.999
<i>'CAUSE I'LL LEVEL WITH YOU,</i>
<i>I DON'T PERSPIRE.</i>

29:18.999 --> 29:20.561
I FREAKING SWEAT.

29:20.561 --> 29:21.962
HERE.

29:21.962 --> 29:23.764
OH, THANK YOU.

29:23.764 --> 29:25.926
THIS IS EXCESSIVE,
EVEN FOR ME.

29:25.926 --> 29:28.168
I WAS IN A DONKEY COSTUME
FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PRODUCTION

29:28.168 --> 29:29.970
OF "DON QUIXOTE"
AND I DIDN'T SWEAT THIS MUCH.

29:29.970 --> 29:33.654
HEY, YOU'VE AUDITIONED FOR
LOTS OF STUFF BEFORE, RIGHT?

29:33.654 --> 29:35.095
HIT ME WHEN I'M DOWN.
THAT'S NOT NICE.

29:35.095 --> 29:36.176
THEY'RE HOLDING AUDITIONS
FOR "BELLS ARE RINGING"

29:36.176 --> 29:37.337
AT SCHOOL ON FRIDAY.

29:37.337 --> 29:39.339
OH, I KNOW THAT SHOW.
I LIKE THAT SHOW.

29:39.339 --> 29:41.101
I GOING TO AUDITION FOR
THE TOURING COMPANY ONCE,

29:41.101 --> 29:42.943
BUT THE NIGHT BEFORE,
I THREW UP ON THE CHOREOGRAPHER.

29:42.943 --> 29:44.785
‐ OH, YOU GOT SICK?
‐ NO, I‐‐

29:44.785 --> 29:46.707
YEAH.
SO I MISSED THE AUDITION.

29:46.707 --> 29:48.188
AND IF YOU THINK THIS
IS A LOT OF SWEAT,

29:48.188 --> 29:50.551
YOU SHOULD SEE ME AFTER
I THROW UP ON A CHOREOGRAPHER.

29:50.551 --> 29:52.192
WELL, I WAS WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU'D HELP ME

29:52.192 --> 29:54.154
PREPARE FOR THE AUDITION
FOR "BELLS ARE RINGING"

29:54.154 --> 29:55.435
<i>AT SCHOOL?</i>

29:55.435 --> 29:56.837
YEAH, SURE.
ABSOLUTELY.

29:56.837 --> 29:58.198
REALLY?
TOMORROW AFTERNOON?

29:58.198 --> 29:59.960
SURE.
YEAH, SURE.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.123
Sal: <i>MILLICENT!</i>
<i>WHERE THE HELL DID YOU</i>
<i>GET THOSE PICTURES?!</i>

30:03.123 --> 30:04.805
OH GOD,
I BETTER GET
BACK DOWN THERE.

30:13.253 --> 30:16.256
TALIA, STOP STEALING
THE SILVER.

30:16.256 --> 30:19.660
GOD, THAT IS THE BEST SHOWER
I HAVE EVER BEEN IN.

30:19.660 --> 30:21.662
‐ DON'T SAY IT.
‐ WHAT, THAT YOU'VE BEEN
IN A LOT OF SHOWERS?

30:21.662 --> 30:23.504
‐ I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.
‐ THANK YOU.

30:23.504 --> 30:25.425
THINK FANNY WILL MIND
THAT WE'RE STAYING
IN HER HOUSE?

30:25.425 --> 30:27.347
‐ NO.
‐ THINK SHE'LL MIND I
USED ALL HER LOTION?

30:27.347 --> 30:29.269
‐ NO.
‐ THINK SHE'LL EVER KNOW
THAT WE STAYED IN HER HOUSE

30:29.269 --> 30:30.511
AND I USED
ALL HER LOTION?

30:30.511 --> 30:31.752
NO.

30:31.752 --> 30:33.874
WOW.
CHAMPAGNE AND PIZZA.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.676
ARE WE DATING
BOWLING CHAMPS AGAIN?

30:35.676 --> 30:37.117
NOPE.
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

30:37.117 --> 30:38.879
‐ YES. CELEBRATING WHAT?
‐ WHOO!

30:38.879 --> 30:42.122
WE GOT THE COMMUNITY BOARD
TO SIGN OFF ON THE AMPHITHEATER,

30:42.122 --> 30:44.284
‐ SO WE'RE GOOD TO GO.
‐ WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

30:44.284 --> 30:45.646
MY FIRST PANTSUIT VICTORY.

30:45.646 --> 30:47.247
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
AT FIRST,

30:47.247 --> 30:49.089
I WAS ALL AGAINST
THE WHOLE CONCEPT,

30:49.089 --> 30:50.250
BUT NOW I GET IT.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.411
IT'S BINDING.

30:51.411 --> 30:53.173
SO IT KEEPS
ALL YOUR POWERS IN.

30:53.173 --> 30:55.175
PLUS, THERE'S NO POTENTIAL
"BASIC INSTINCT" MOMENT.

30:55.175 --> 30:57.017
SO SUDDENLY YOU'RE NOT
THINKING ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE SITTING

30:57.017 --> 30:59.660
AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED
HOW MUCH BRAIN SPACE
THAT FREES UP.

30:59.660 --> 31:01.662
PLUS, THE POCKETS.

31:01.662 --> 31:03.263
DANCE CLOTHES NEVER
HAVE ANY POCKETS,

31:03.263 --> 31:04.865
BUT THIS SUIT HAS
POCKETS EVERYWHERE.

31:04.865 --> 31:05.946
AND...

31:10.671 --> 31:11.752
YOU CAN DO THAT.

31:11.752 --> 31:14.114
I HAVE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO THAT.

31:14.114 --> 31:16.276
‐ TO HILLARY CLINTON.
‐ HEAR HEAR.

31:16.276 --> 31:18.278
DRINK UP.
I WANT TO TAKE
MY NEW PANTSUIT

31:18.278 --> 31:19.880
OUT FOR A SPIN.
SEE IF GUYS CAN
PICK UP

31:19.880 --> 31:22.683

SUPER POWERS.

VEGAS.

31:28.008 --> 31:29.650
HELLO? THIS IS TALIA.

31:29.650 --> 31:31.331
‐ WHO?
‐ IS IT RICK?
IS HE DEAD?

31:31.331 --> 31:33.133
WHAT? NO.
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

31:33.133 --> 31:35.095
YOU HAD A "MY ANCIENT
BOYFRIEND MIGHT BE DEAD"
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

31:35.095 --> 31:37.097
SHH. YEAH, NO.
OF COURSE I DO.

31:37.097 --> 31:38.659
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

31:38.659 --> 31:40.300
WOW. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

31:40.300 --> 31:43.223
UH‐HUH.
YOU'RE KIDDING.

31:43.223 --> 31:44.665
YOU'RE KIDDING!
YOU'RE KIDDING.

31:44.665 --> 31:47.427
‐ I DON'T THINK THEY'RE KIDDING.
‐ WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

31:47.427 --> 31:48.669
I'M NOT REALLY‐‐

31:48.669 --> 31:51.111
UM, OKAY.

31:51.111 --> 31:52.432
SURE.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.674
I WILL TALK
TO YOU LATER.

31:55.355 --> 31:56.316
‐ WHOA.
‐ WHAT?

31:56.316 --> 31:58.118
DO YOU REMEMBER
ANDY DONNELLY?

31:58.118 --> 31:59.960
‐ THE ONE WHO ONLY
WEARS BIKE SHORTS?
‐ NO.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.481
‐ THE ONE WHO PUNCHED
DON RICKLES?
‐ NO.

32:01.481 --> 32:03.684
WE WAS AT CRAZY HORSE PARIS
WHEN I WORKED THERE, REMEMBER?

32:03.684 --> 32:05.125
‐ A BUNCH OF YEARS AGO?
‐ THE CHOREOGRAPHER.

32:05.125 --> 32:06.727
‐ SORT OF.
‐ SORT OF?

32:06.727 --> 32:09.369
‐ HE PARKED CARS.
‐ HOW IS THAT SORT OF
A CHOREOGRAPHER?

32:09.369 --> 32:11.772
‐ THE PARKING LOT
WAS VERY TRICKY.
‐ RIGHT.

32:11.772 --> 32:13.173
ANYHOW, WE HAD LIKE
A TWO WEEK THING,

32:13.173 --> 32:15.255
AND I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO HIM FOR EIGHT YEARS

32:15.255 --> 32:16.496
AND NOW HE'S
ONE OF THE PRODUCERS

32:16.496 --> 32:18.258
‐ OF "ROCK OF AGES."
‐ ARE YOU SERIOUS?

32:18.258 --> 32:20.100
YEAH, AND HE HAS
A PART TO FILL ASAP,

32:20.100 --> 32:22.262
‐ AND THOUGHT OF ME.
‐ AFTER EIGHT YEARS
HE THOUGHT OF YOU.

32:22.262 --> 32:24.064
‐ JUST LIKE THAT?
‐ I GUESS SO.

32:24.064 --> 32:25.546
YOU SLEEP WITH A GUY
FOR TWO WEEKS

32:25.546 --> 32:27.588
AND EIGHT YEARS LATER, HE JUST
THINKS OF YOU FOR A PART.

32:27.588 --> 32:29.870
‐ WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?
‐ THAT YOU ARE REALLY
GOOD IN BED.

32:29.870 --> 32:31.672
‐ WELL, DUH.
‐ WOW.

32:31.672 --> 32:33.674
A PART.
"ROCK OF AGES."

32:33.674 --> 32:35.275
‐ NEW YORK?
‐ <i>TOURING FOR NOW,</i>

32:35.275 --> 32:36.757
BUT THEY PULL A LOT OF
THEIR BROADWAY REPLACEMENTS

32:36.757 --> 32:39.119
FROM THE TOURING COMPANY,
SO IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

32:39.119 --> 32:40.280
NEW YORK!

32:40.280 --> 32:44.044
GEEZ, THAT'S GREAT.

32:44.044 --> 32:45.485
YEAH, HE'S GONNA CALL
LATER WITH DETAILS.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.848
‐ SO?
‐ SO...

32:47.848 --> 32:49.890
SO WHY AREN'T YOU EXCITED?

32:49.890 --> 32:51.812
I AM. I JUST DON'T
KNOW IF I CAN DO IT.

32:51.812 --> 32:54.094
SURE YOU CAN.
HAVE YOU SEEN "ROCK OF AGES"?

32:54.094 --> 32:55.415
‐ MICHELLE‐‐
‐ MY PANTSUIT COULD
DO "ROCK OF AGES."

32:55.415 --> 32:57.097
‐ I JUST GOT ENGAGED.
‐ SO?

32:57.097 --> 32:59.099
SO I'M JUST SUPPOSED
TO UP AND TAKE OFF?

32:59.099 --> 33:00.260
I COULD BE GONE
FOR LIKE A YEAR.

33:00.260 --> 33:01.421
HE COULD GO WITH YOU.

33:01.421 --> 33:03.103
MOST HOTELS HAVE
WHEELCHAIR RAMPS NOW.

33:03.103 --> 33:05.185
RICK DOES NOT WANT
TO FOLLOW ME AROUND ON TOUR,

33:05.185 --> 33:06.787
AND NEW YORK IS OUT.
RICKY HATES NEW YORK.

33:06.787 --> 33:08.268
SO YOU'RE JUST
GONNA TURN IT DOWN?

33:08.268 --> 33:10.270
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S JUST SO OUT OF THE BLUE.

33:10.270 --> 33:12.192
IT'S CRAZY!
I'VE BEEN SITTING IN VEGAS

33:12.192 --> 33:14.274
ON MY ASS FOR FIVE YEARS,
AND NOTHING.

33:14.274 --> 33:15.355
THE MINUTE
I GET ENGAGED.

33:15.355 --> 33:17.277
I GUESS WHEN
IT RAINS, IT POURS.

33:17.277 --> 33:20.120
I GUESS SO.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.123
SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

33:23.123 --> 33:24.685
I DON'T KNOW.

33:24.685 --> 33:27.287
IT'S NICE TO BE
THOUGHT OF THOUGH.

33:27.287 --> 33:29.289
IT IS.
IT DEFINITELY IS.

33:29.289 --> 33:32.252
WELL, I GUESS
THIS IS TO YOU THEN.

33:32.252 --> 33:34.815
WE BOTH HAVE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

33:34.815 --> 33:36.256
YEAH.

33:39.099 --> 33:40.661
‐ WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
‐ I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

33:40.661 --> 33:42.302
I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS PANTSUIT OFF.

33:42.302 --> 33:43.263

HI.

34:08.288 --> 34:10.130

‐ WAS IT STUCK?
‐ NO.

34:11.652 --> 34:12.733

34:12.733 --> 34:14.655
WELL, IT'S A STUPID
KNOB ANYHOW.

34:14.655 --> 34:16.096
YOU BEEN WAITING LONG?

34:16.096 --> 34:17.658
NOPE. HOUR,
HOUR AND A HALF TOPS.

34:17.658 --> 34:19.259
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WAS OUT LATE CELEBRATING

34:19.259 --> 34:21.582
WITH A FRIEND.
THE DAY KIND OF
GOT AWAY FROM ME.

34:21.582 --> 34:23.263
SHE HAD A GOOD NIGHT
EIGHT YEARS AGO,

34:23.263 --> 34:25.105
AND LOOK AT HER
NOW, RIGHT?

34:25.105 --> 34:28.308
I GOT A PANTSUIT RASH.

34:28.308 --> 34:30.390
‐ YIKES.
‐ YEAH.

34:30.390 --> 34:32.513
OKAY, SO WHAT ARE
WE DOING HERE?

34:32.513 --> 34:34.515
WELL, IT'S CALLED
"A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP"

34:34.515 --> 34:35.836
FROM "BELLS ARE RINGING."

34:35.836 --> 34:37.277
I HAVE TO SING
AND THERE'S A LITTLE ROUTINE.

34:37.277 --> 34:39.279
AND I SET UP A SWITCHBOARD
BECAUSE SHE WORKS AT‐‐

34:39.279 --> 34:40.440

34:40.440 --> 34:42.442
SO, SHOULD I
JUST JUMP IN?

34:42.442 --> 34:44.124

34:53.133 --> 34:54.374
WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

34:54.374 --> 34:55.656
‐ I'VE GOT THE SONG.
‐ ON THAT?

34:55.656 --> 34:57.658
‐ <i>YEAH.</i>
‐ NO MORE CASSETTE TAPES, HUH?

34:57.658 --> 34:59.339

‐ WHAT?

34:59.339 --> 35:02.182
UH, YEAH. GO AHEAD.

35:02.182 --> 35:03.624
I HAD TO USE
CASSETTE TAPES.

35:03.624 --> 35:06.386
‐ WHAT?
‐ BABBLING.
MOVING ON.

35:08.669 --> 35:11.271
NEVER TURN UP YOUR NOSE
AT A VALET PARKER.

35:11.271 --> 35:12.673
‐ OKAY.
‐ IT'S A GOOD TIP.

35:12.673 --> 35:15.275
‐ I'M SURE.

39:58.238 --> 39:59.840
WELL WELL WELL,
THERE SHE IS,

39:59.840 --> 40:00.921
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

40:00.921 --> 40:02.683
THE CONQUERING
HERO RETURNS.

40:02.683 --> 40:04.244
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

40:04.244 --> 40:05.846
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY DID IT.

40:05.846 --> 40:07.688
YOU ACTUALLY AUDITIONED
FOR A SCHOOL PLAY.

40:07.688 --> 40:08.689
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL US?

40:08.689 --> 40:10.410
I DID TELL YOU
AND YOU MOCKED ME.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.412
‐ WE DID.
‐ WE HAVE BEEN SILENCED
AND CHASTENED.

40:12.412 --> 40:13.974
WE HEARD
YOU WERE GREAT.

40:13.974 --> 40:15.656
YOU DID? FROM WHO?
AND DID THEY SAY GREAT
OR REALLY GREAT?

40:15.656 --> 40:16.857
ALLY WAS WORKING
ON SETS AND SHE SAID

40:16.857 --> 40:18.579
EVERYONE WAS
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

40:18.579 --> 40:20.140
WERE THEY?
HOW DEAR.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.543
‐ WHAT?
‐ SHE'S BEING OBNOXIOUS
AND PRETENTIOUS.

40:22.543 --> 40:24.545
WELL, US IN THE BIZ
HAVE TO HAVE A HEALTHY EGO.

40:24.545 --> 40:26.226
‐ THAT'S HOW WE SURVIVE.
‐ HOW'D YOU FINALLY
GET THE NERVE?

40:26.226 --> 40:27.508
<i>I ASKED MICHELLE</i>
<i>TO COACH ME.</i>

40:27.508 --> 40:28.829
‐ YOU'RE KIDDING.
‐ SHE WAS MEAN

40:28.829 --> 40:30.150
AND CALLED ME NAMES,
AND THEN SHE SHOWED ME

40:30.150 --> 40:32.152
HOW GOOD SHE IS
AND HOW BAD I WAS,

40:32.152 --> 40:33.514
AND THEN SHE THREW
HER WATER ON ME.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.915
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE
THAT WAS TOTALLY ON PURPOSE.

40:34.915 --> 40:37.117
‐ SOUNDS AWESOME.
‐ <i>IT WAS AWESOME.</i>

40:37.117 --> 40:38.438
BECAUSE IF I COULD GET UP
AND SING IN FRONT OF HER,

40:38.438 --> 40:40.320
MRS. MERKOWSKI,
THE HALF‐DEAF MUSIC TEACHER

40:40.320 --> 40:41.842
WASN'T GOING TO
BE A PROBLEM.

40:41.842 --> 40:43.443
AND SHE WASN'T,
AND I ROCKED.

40:43.443 --> 40:45.445
‐ WE BOW TO YOU.
‐ AS WELL YOU SHOULD.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.247
‐ SO, WHEN DO YOU HEAR?
‐ CALLBACKS ARE TUESDAY.

40:47.247 --> 40:48.849
IT'S BETWEEN ME,
SARI ENFIELD,

40:48.849 --> 40:49.850
AND TYRONE FREDRICKS.

40:49.850 --> 40:51.371
Melanie:
<i>OH, TY'S GOOD.</i>

40:51.371 --> 40:53.093
YEAH, BUT HE PLAYED THE LEAD IN
"THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODY"

40:53.093 --> 40:55.255
LAST YEAR, SO THEY'VE GOT TO
GO WITH FRESH BLOOD THIS TIME.

40:55.255 --> 40:57.097
GET IT, DON'T GET IT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

40:57.097 --> 40:59.620
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT
I AM NOW OFFICIALLY FABULOUS.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.222
<i>( Frankie and Cozette</i>
<i>chatter )</i>

41:02.222 --> 41:03.223
OKAY.

41:04.545 --> 41:05.946
EXCUSE ME A SEC.

41:13.233 --> 41:15.395
HEY THERE, SAILOR.
DOING A LITTLE SKETCH,
ARE YOU?

41:15.395 --> 41:17.397
WORKING ON A MURAL
FOR THE STUDIO.

41:17.397 --> 41:18.839
A MURAL.

41:18.839 --> 41:20.240
SO DIEGO RIVERA.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.002
FANNY TOLD ME IF I WAS
GONNA SIT HERE EVERY DAY,

41:22.002 --> 41:23.403
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

41:23.403 --> 41:24.605
IT WAS THIS OR TIGHTS.

41:24.605 --> 41:27.407
WELL, PERSONALLY,
I'D VOTE FOR BOTH.

41:27.407 --> 41:28.849
HEY, FRANKIE,

41:28.849 --> 41:29.850
YOU KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING TODAY

41:29.850 --> 41:31.251
AFTER MY AUDITION?

41:31.251 --> 41:33.253
I WAS THINKING,
YOU AND ME,

41:33.253 --> 41:34.414
WE SHOULD HANG.

41:34.414 --> 41:36.256
‐ HUH?
‐ YOU KNOW, HANG.

41:36.256 --> 41:37.257
DO SOME HANGING.

41:39.419 --> 41:41.421
OF YOUR PICTURES.

41:41.421 --> 41:45.265
WHICH I‐‐ I BET
NEED TO BE HUNG.

41:49.229 --> 41:50.390
UM...

41:50.390 --> 41:51.431
I'M NOT WARMED UP.

41:57.838 --> 41:58.839
‐ WHAT THE HELL?
‐ SHUT UP.

42:03.403 --> 42:05.405
WOW.
THAT WAS AWKWARD.

42:05.405 --> 42:07.407
LIKE WHITE SHORTS IN
A RAINSTORM AWKWARD.

42:07.407 --> 42:09.089
BUT HERE IS
THE BRIGHT SPOT.

42:09.089 --> 42:11.091
FRANKIE ACTUALLY
LOVES AWKWARD.

42:11.091 --> 42:12.533
HE THRIVES ON IT.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.134
IT'S COMFORTABLE THAT
HE HAS A PROBLEM WITH.

42:14.134 --> 42:16.096
<i>SO YOU'VE JUST MADE</i>
<i>SOME SERIOUS HEADWAY.</i>

42:16.096 --> 42:17.377
‐ WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
‐ OH, I WAS JUST‐‐

42:17.377 --> 42:18.579
<i>I DIDN'T ASK YOUR OPINION.</i>

42:18.579 --> 42:20.060
I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO COME OVER HERE

42:20.060 --> 42:21.582
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT GAVE YOU
THE IMPRESSION THAT I DID.

42:21.582 --> 42:22.543
‐ I WAS JUST TRYING‐‐
‐ <i>DON'T.</i>

42:22.543 --> 42:24.024
DON'T TRY ANYTHING.

42:24.024 --> 42:25.786
GO TAKE YOUR
MASSIVE WARDROBE

42:25.786 --> 42:27.187
AND YOUR "OH SO
COOL" ATTITUDE,

42:27.187 --> 42:30.470
AND FIND ANOTHER
PERSON TO BOTHER.

42:30.470 --> 42:31.712
HEY, HEIDI?

42:31.712 --> 42:33.594
<i>IT DOESN'T REALLY</i>
<i>MATTER TO ME</i>

42:33.594 --> 42:34.915
<i>WHETHER WE'RE</i>
<i>FRIENDS OR NOT,</i>

42:34.915 --> 42:36.236
BUT JUST TO CLARIFY,

42:36.236 --> 42:38.599
MY FAMILY IS TIGHT.
ZAPPA TIGHT.

42:38.599 --> 42:39.920
<i>SO IF YOU WANT</i>
<i>A CHANCE WITH THE BROTHER,</i>

42:39.920 --> 42:41.842
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO BE COOL WITH ME.

42:41.842 --> 42:43.083
SORRY.

42:54.094 --> 42:55.696
I JUST THINK IF I GO
HE WON'T WAIT.

42:55.696 --> 42:58.018
LONG‐DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
CAN BE HARD.

42:58.018 --> 43:00.180
I HAD A BOYFRIEND
WHO WAS IN THE PEACE CORPS.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.862
WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR TWO WEEKS
BEFORE HE LEFT,

43:01.862 --> 43:03.423
AND THEN HE WAS
GONE FOR A YEAR.

43:03.423 --> 43:04.625
YOU'RE KIDDING.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.346
AND I WAS
COMPLETELY FAITHFUL.

43:06.346 --> 43:07.427
HOW?

43:07.427 --> 43:08.869
IT WAS VERY
DIFFICULT.

43:08.869 --> 43:11.431
I WATCHED A LOT OF
"LITTLE HOUSE ON
THE PRAIRIE" RERUNS,

43:11.431 --> 43:13.393
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

43:13.393 --> 43:14.595
OH, SURE.

43:14.595 --> 43:16.156
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK,
HE HAD A BEARD

43:16.156 --> 43:17.477
AND DIRTY FINGERNAILS.

43:17.477 --> 43:18.719
AND HE DRANK THIS TEA
THAT SMELLED LIKE CIGARETTES

43:18.719 --> 43:21.241
AND I JUST FOUND HIM
COMPLETELY DISGUSTING.

43:21.241 --> 43:23.163
PLUS, HE HAD MARRIED
ONE OF THE VILLAGERS,

43:23.163 --> 43:24.685
SO COMPLETE
WASTE OF TIME.

43:24.685 --> 43:27.247
HEY, I MADE HIGH TEA WITH
SCONES AND CLOTTED CREAM.

43:27.247 --> 43:28.408
I WANT ONE.

43:28.408 --> 43:30.330
‐ HERE.
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

43:30.330 --> 43:32.252
I DON'T KNOW,

43:32.252 --> 43:34.615
BUT IT'S NOT GOING
TO INCLUDE A PANTSUIT.
