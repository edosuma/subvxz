00:03.537 --> 00:05.339
You know, I'd like to meet
your ex sometime.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.076
Carla? You two would
not get along.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.811
Hi, Mom. I told you to keep
your grift out of Montana.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.980
I'm on the straight
and narrow now.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.848
You always have been
a very good liar.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.817
- Why did you come back?
- Hi, there.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.252
Thanks so much
for stopping by.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.421
- Where's Paige?
- I don't know.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.023
- She's not with you?
- No.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.825
You think the kid's
telling the truth?

00:24.858 --> 00:25.926
- You don't?
- Something just doesn't

00:25.959 --> 00:27.027
sit right with me.

00:27.061 --> 00:27.995
I'm not buying Luke's story.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.663
Not everything is a mystery.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.764
Have you seen her?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.266
I didn't do anything.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.235
Have you seen this girl?!

00:34.268 --> 00:35.369
No.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.705
Stop!
Don't come any closer!

00:40.274 --> 00:41.742
Come back!

02:15.369 --> 02:17.305
Autumn?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.207
Is that you?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.918
Hoyt? Hey.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.488
You good?
Where's your head at?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.589
Nowhere.
I'm all good.

03:10.791 --> 03:14.027
All good my ass.
You're a bad liar, Hoyt.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.697
I told you we were gonna fix
this situation with your mom.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.667
How? She stole
30 grand from me.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.369
Well, technically, she stole it
from the government.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.271
Same government that
spends 50 bucks

03:23.304 --> 03:26.240
on a roll of
toilet paper.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.676
She helped us catch a murderer.
Maybe we call it a wash.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.578
It's personal.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.346
Okay.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.548
The bills were marked,
so there is that.

03:34.582 --> 03:35.783
Okay, can we please not talk
about this anymore?

03:35.816 --> 03:36.884
Copy that.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.088
All right, here we go.

03:59.139 --> 04:01.241
The victim is Jody Cutter, 46.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.711
Her daughter, Autumn, found her
body this morning, throat cut.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.145
Estimated time of death--
2:00 a.m.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.149
She has a torn skirt.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.751
Feet are all messed up.
Maybe she was dragged back here.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.885
You think
maybe sexual assault?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.454
Yeah, we'll run the labs.

04:13.487 --> 04:16.557
Judging by the blood,
she died over here.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.225
Back door was open.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.794
We found, uh, fragments of
broken glass in the kitchen.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.496
Apparently
she was home alone.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.133
What's this?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.235
Got a bloody fingerprint
on the back door, too.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.103
It's the victim's.
We found a cut on her finger.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.441
The broken glass
in the kitchen.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.942
She must have cut herself.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.310
Neighbors see anything?

04:36.344 --> 04:38.412
No.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.147
All right. Well, cameras on
everything these days.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.982
You know, people put them up,
they forget all about them.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.851
Why don't we do the rounds,
and maybe we'll get lucky?

04:43.884 --> 04:45.786
You got it.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.856
Her family inside?

04:48.889 --> 04:50.791
Husband and daughter.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.827
Let's go talk to them.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.969
I should've been here.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.871
If I'd had just come home.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.176
You were at work
all night, right?

05:09.209 --> 05:11.445
Yeah, the truck came by,
and we had to restock

05:11.479 --> 05:12.980
the bikes and get a jump
on the repair backlog.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.182
You own a bike shop?

05:15.215 --> 05:17.385
Yeah.
Mountain Trails.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.186
A Pro-Am is coming
into town next week.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.721
It's just
been really crazy.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.990
Can anyone back up your alibi
from last night?

05:23.023 --> 05:28.629
Why? My dad would
never hurt my mom.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.299
Just standard questions
in cases like this.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.401
You can ask my employees.
They were there.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.469
And Scott and I
worked all night.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.371
I just-- I don't know
why someone

05:37.405 --> 05:39.272
would do something
like this.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.648
Has there been anyone
around the house lately?

05:47.681 --> 05:49.417
Contractors, handymen?

05:49.450 --> 05:52.886
Not that I know of. No.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.589
Anything missing
in the house?

05:55.623 --> 05:58.358
No.

05:58.392 --> 06:00.594
And I understand you were
at your boyfriend's

06:00.628 --> 06:02.262
all night last night.
Is that correct?

06:02.295 --> 06:05.065
Uh-huh.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.267
I got back late from
a volleyball tournament,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.102
so I stayed
at my boyfriend's.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.904
Were you in touch
with your mom?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.039
Of course.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.242
I texted her, and I told her
I wasn't gonna be home.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.744
Was she okay with that?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.283
Yeah.

06:23.316 --> 06:26.520
Has she mentioned
anything strange lately?

06:26.554 --> 06:28.689
Odd phone calls,
somebody in the yard?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.257
Anything we can go on?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.560
No.
Not that I remember.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.696
So, you think this was just some
sort of random attack?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.264
Unfortunately,
in cases like this,

06:37.297 --> 06:38.799
it's usually someone
the victim already knows.

06:43.571 --> 06:47.274
It's usually the husband,
but I don't know.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.942
Now, why's it always
gotta be the husband?

06:48.976 --> 06:50.277
-'Cause it usually is.
- Uh-huh.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.045
Yeah, but did you see
the daughter

06:52.079 --> 06:53.747
when you asked what her mom
thought of her boyfriend?

06:53.781 --> 06:56.383
She looked at her screen,
got all weird. You saw that.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.652
Something's not right
about that house.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.054
So, what? You think
the daughter did it?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.790
I'm just saying we
shouldn't rule it out.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.157
I don't think
Autumn's a killer.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.127
- Well...
- Could it be random?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.997
It could be.
But my gut's saying it ain't.

07:13.100 --> 07:18.338
<i>♪ I can wait at the canyon's
corner and I'm back away ♪</i>

07:18.371 --> 07:21.408
<i>♪ I can see you looking into

07:22.810 --> 07:25.178
<i>♪ Won't peel your cowl back,

07:25.212 --> 07:27.414
You seen your father
this morning?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
Nope.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.184
I can't believe
he missed breakfast.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.353
I'll take a look
on the trail.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.955
Probably just checking
for bears and rattlers.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.256
You know how he gets.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.425
Worry a minute, that man.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.293
Are you makin'
a supply run into town?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.362
- I am.
- Okay.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.665
Just remember to mind
your own business down there.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.000
Those folks don't need to know
what's goin' on with our guests.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.536
With Paige especially.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.504
Yeah, a little faith, please.
I got it.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.039
All right. All right.

07:52.072 --> 07:55.809
Hey, uh...
so, you know,

07:55.843 --> 07:58.211
I got a good look at the trail
to the put-out.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.147
Didn't see any fresh tracks
leading down.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.315
- Yeah?
- If Paige left at night,

08:02.349 --> 08:03.951
it would've been
a heavy-footed trek in the dark,

08:03.984 --> 08:06.620
messy as all hell.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.388
Nothing.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.990
You know, that girl never
did strike me

08:10.023 --> 08:11.859
as the kind
to take the easy way.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.360
Could be she just took
an alternate route

08:13.393 --> 08:15.295
and missed
our trail entirely.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.499
Another subject to keep
tight-lipped about.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.501
Paige has a problem,
let her vent on Yelp.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.904
Okay?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.706
- Okay.
- All right. See you later.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.810
So, what are you guys
doing this morning?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.880
Oh, we thought we'd go
for a hike up to the lake

08:32.913 --> 08:34.214
or maybe even
a group trail ride.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.049
What do you think?

08:36.083 --> 08:37.517
Well, I was actually thinking
that we could go look

08:37.551 --> 08:38.652
for my knife.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.153
Oh.

08:40.187 --> 08:42.389
Happened to have
a replacement for ya.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.691
Oh, wow.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.092
Uh, it was
a gift from my dad,

08:45.125 --> 08:46.694
so I have to find it,
but thank you.

08:46.727 --> 08:50.664
Yeah. Well, you can use
that one until you find yours.

08:50.698 --> 08:51.732
That's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.567
My pleasure.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.502
Well, the lake is beautiful
this time of the year,

08:55.535 --> 08:56.570
so if y'all need anything
else, just holler.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.771
Okay?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.873
- Oh, I do, actually.
- Hit me.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.276
Did Paige get back
to New York okay?

09:04.778 --> 09:07.080
We were just curious.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.549
She sure did.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.118
Paige made it back
safe and sound, honey,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.920
so you don't have
to worry anymore.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.589
Well, that's great news,
isn't it?

09:15.623 --> 09:16.957
Okay, well, I hope y'all
put all this behind you

09:16.990 --> 09:18.558
and have a good time.

09:18.592 --> 09:21.561
- Okay? See you later.
- See ya.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.798
Everything going good?
Excellent.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.773
- Hey.
- Hey, Cass.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.574
Sorry to bother you.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.776
I know you're busy with
the Cutter murder.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.877
- No, never too busy for you.
- What's up?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.545
Yeah, what's going on?

09:38.578 --> 09:39.713
I just wanted to get
another set of eyes

09:39.747 --> 09:41.481
on this backpacker case.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.717
I can't be 100%, but I think
he e-mailed an old photo

09:43.751 --> 09:46.386
trying to play it off
as recent.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.888
Well, there's no law
against that.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.156
Beau's been using
a 10-year-old picture

09:49.189 --> 09:50.290
for the department website.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.759
I have.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.293
You really got to change
that photo.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.662
Never.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.563
Was this taken
from his phone?

09:56.596 --> 09:58.331
Uh, yeah, but I don't think
Mark sent it.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.599
Wait, this Logan Pass,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.168
is this anywhere near
Emily's camp?

10:01.201 --> 10:03.236
It's miles away.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.138
Someone could be trying
to throw us off the scent.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.307
So do you think your tech guy
can take a look,

10:07.340 --> 10:08.475
see if he can get anything
from the photo?

10:08.508 --> 10:10.744
- Of course.
- Great. Appreciate it.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.012
See ya.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.614
Hey.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.617
I got something weird you
two are gonna want to see.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.520
So, we pulled footage off
a game cam a neighbor set up.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.256
Raccoons were getting
in his trash cans.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.792
Really good thinking,
by the way.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.259
- Thank you.
- Okay, enough with the suck-ups.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.861
What do you got?

10:27.895 --> 10:32.632
Right. So, as you can see,
raccoons, possums, and...

10:35.502 --> 10:37.004
What the hell is that?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.174
Is that a werewolf?
That's a first for me.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.409
Zoom in.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.048
There's blood on his arm.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.050
Maybe our victim fought back.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.484
Maybe she fought back
with that broken glass,

10:51.518 --> 10:52.686
- whatever that was from.
- Hmm.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.954
Looks like we need
to go have

10:53.987 --> 10:54.822
a chat with
the family again.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.024
Let's do it.

10:57.891 --> 11:01.661
Hey. Hey.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.333
Hey, I'm, uh, heading up to meet
Em and Avery tomorrow.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.635
I figured I'd stop by.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.904
Um...

11:10.938 --> 11:12.305
Jenny Hoyt.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.074
- Uh-huh.
- This is my ex-wife, Carla.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.843
Listen, could we not
do this right now?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.978
- Do what?
- That thing you do.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.213
I'm not doing anything.
Ugh, so sensitive.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.849
Big old man baby.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.150
Yeah, I'm not gonna--
I'm not gonna do this.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
- Okay. See?
- I'm joking.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.020
Right.
We got to get to work.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.822
Uh, we got a break in the case.
We're kind of in a hurry, so...

11:28.856 --> 11:30.257
Does this have anything to
do with that missing backpacker

11:30.290 --> 11:31.859
where Avery and Emily
are camping?

11:31.892 --> 11:33.994
Yeah, uh--
No, it's--

11:34.027 --> 11:35.662
Avery said
he saw you up there.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.565
It, uh-- I was gonna
tell you about that.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.668
Still working on those
communication skills?

11:41.701 --> 11:43.203
He's actually
getting better.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.072
It's one of
his best qualities.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.240
We have a murder to solve.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.375
Yeah. I don't want to
keep you from that.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.911
Okay, but I--
I need a word, please.

11:53.747 --> 11:54.948
- Could you give us a minute?
- Oh, yeah, I was just

11:54.982 --> 11:56.116
going to suggest that.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.056
Yeah. What's up?

12:03.090 --> 12:05.358
It's just-- Avery said that
everything is fine up there,

12:05.392 --> 12:07.027
but he just
wants this bonding weekend

12:07.060 --> 12:08.428
to be so perfect and--

12:08.461 --> 12:10.230
And you don't trust him.
Great, me neither.

12:10.263 --> 12:15.302
Stop. I just know he can get,
like, hyper-focused.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.904
You know, you didn't even ask me
if Em could go camping

12:16.937 --> 12:18.438
- with, uh, pbht.
- Avery.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.040
His name's Avery.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.641
Yeah, well, I can
think of others.

12:21.674 --> 12:22.976
Okay. And you know what, Beau?
We did talk about it.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.411
You just weren't listening.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.046
I was supposed to be up
there with them.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.247
I had an emergency at work.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.549
I just need to know that
there's nothing to worry about

12:29.582 --> 12:31.218
with this whole
backpacker thing.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.821
There's nothing
to worry about.

12:33.854 --> 12:37.891
Okay. Good.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.461
Don't forget, you promised
Em she could stay with me

12:41.494 --> 12:42.930
the first weekend back
from this, uh, camping crap.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.933
I know.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.300
Okay. See ya.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.302
Okay.

12:49.336 --> 12:51.004
Nice meeting you.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.173
Back at ya.

12:56.643 --> 12:57.710
Interesting.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.848
What?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.916
You're still
in love with her.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.984
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.853
- No. Stop it.
- You are.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.355
Just admit it.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.699
Not like you
to miss breakfast.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.768
Not like you to lie to me.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.337
Now, Buck.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.439
Now, don't "Buck" me.
I know what you've been up to.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.342
Lying, late-night walks,
sneaking around.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.149
He's here, isn't he?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.685
Now, we've been
over this, Sunny.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.354
You promised me Walter
would stay in the woods.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.156
He came to me.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.825
For what?

13:45.859 --> 13:47.127
Better you don't know.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.695
Best I don't know?

13:48.728 --> 13:50.964
It's a little too late for that,
isn't it?

13:50.998 --> 13:53.800
Geez.
He's dangerous, Sunny.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.003
No, he's not.

13:56.036 --> 13:58.138
That happened
a long time ago.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.572
Well, what is it now?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.174
Has he got something to do
with Paige?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.310
No, of course not.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.411
What about
the missing backpacker?

14:04.444 --> 14:07.881
You're wrong about Walter.
Dead wrong.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.650
- Am I?
- Yeah, you are.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.119
Do I need to remind you
what he did?

14:13.853 --> 14:17.024
No, you don't.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.558
Your boy murdered
his parents.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.060
They weren't his parents.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.661
- Yes, they were.
- No, they weren't.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.397
- They adopted him.
- No.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.499
He killed them.
Trapped them in their house.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.867
It's not that simple.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.037
And watched it burn.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.871
Now, I agreed to look
the other way

14:31.905 --> 14:34.441
as long as he stayed
in the woods, but this,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.776
this is crossing lines
I don't want to cross.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.411
Don't do this, Buck.

14:40.480 --> 14:44.117
Don't make me have to choose
between my husband and my child.

14:44.151 --> 14:47.020
I'm not.
Cormac is our child.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.455
Walter is not.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.457
I brought him
into this sorry world.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.892
I need to know
that he's kept safe.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.894
Well, not here.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.297
And that's not
a request, darling.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.766
The past needs to stay
where it belongs.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.169
And it'll be better
for him anyway.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.640
I'll talk to him about it.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.142
- You'll talk to him about it?
- Yeah.

15:09.176 --> 15:12.912
Well, you're gonna
do more than that.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.247
End it.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.748
Or I will.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.829
Hey, Autumn.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.499
Hi.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.134
Um, my dad's not home.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.337
Um, just my boyfriend, Derek.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.239
Ah.
Where's your dad?

15:39.272 --> 15:40.740
I don't know.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.977
Autumn, I know this is
a really bad time,

15:44.011 --> 15:47.080
but found an image of the person
who we believe is responsible.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.350
It came from a game cam
your neighbor set up.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.552
Any chance you recognize
the mask?

15:56.489 --> 15:57.524
No.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.326
What about you?

15:59.359 --> 16:01.995
No.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.696
You mind pushing
your sleeves up for me?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.498
What?

16:05.532 --> 16:06.799
Just want to check something
on your forearms.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.368
You mind pushing
your sleeves up?

16:08.401 --> 16:10.803
Uh, okay.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.011
Great. Thank you.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.380
Do you want to tell me
what this is about?

16:20.413 --> 16:21.781
Is there anything you can
tell us about your mom

16:21.814 --> 16:23.416
that could help us?

16:25.885 --> 16:27.454
Just tell them.

16:27.487 --> 16:30.890
I just-- I don't want
my dad to find out.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.359
Find out what?

16:32.392 --> 16:35.162
I saw my mom
with another guy.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.729
We totally
walked in on them.

16:36.763 --> 16:37.964
Last night?

16:37.997 --> 16:41.501
A month ago.
I confronted her.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.969
I told her she had to break
it off before my dad found out.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.804

20:58.257 --> 21:00.827
No, don't. Don't.
Don't touch that.

21:00.860 --> 21:04.531
Walter.
Whose blood is this?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.235
It's the--
the backpacker.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.638

21:59.819 --> 22:02.154
when we were kids.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.823
I remember this one shop.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.192
There was a-- There was
a severed human finger

22:06.225 --> 22:07.694
floating in yellow fluid.

22:07.727 --> 22:10.797
No matter where you were,
it would always point at you.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.264
Never figured out
how it did that.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.808
Hey, check this out.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.776
Yeah.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.380
Whoa.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.348
Yeah.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.017
At least we know
we're in the right place.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.084
Yep.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.989
Sheriff's department.
Don't move.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.591
Drop the weapon now.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.227
Whoa.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.362
It's an antique.
Setting it down.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.097
Is this about Jody Cutter?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.198
- You tell us.
- We know about

22:46.232 --> 22:47.333
the affair, Craig.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.169
Her daughter tell you
about that?

22:50.202 --> 22:52.739
- She did.
- So what happened?

22:52.772 --> 22:54.674
Jody cut it off
and sent you over the edge?

22:54.707 --> 22:58.344
What? No.
I'd never hurt her.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.680
She was
the love of my life.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.715
It doesn't make any sense.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.684
She was still alive
when I left.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.252
Wait, you were there
last night?

23:06.285 --> 23:08.455
We had dinner.
A few drinks.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.156
Let me see
your forearms.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.271
Tell me something.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.208
What can you tell
us about that?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.277
Do you recognize
the mask?

23:33.079 --> 23:36.215
Of course I do.
I sold it to her.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.117
Her? Her who?

23:38.150 --> 23:40.052
Jody.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.788
It was for
a Halloween party.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.623
Her and Grant were doing

23:43.656 --> 23:45.758
a Red Riding Hood/Big Bad Wolf thing.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.182
Whoo!

24:10.216 --> 24:11.951
Not bad for someone

24:11.984 --> 24:13.119
who's new to ATVs.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.621
Oh, well, thank you.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.489
My dad had a three-wheeler
when I was a kid,

24:16.523 --> 24:18.157
and he let me ride it
to the market

24:18.190 --> 24:19.692
until he found out
how easily they tip over, so...

24:19.726 --> 24:22.128
Right.

24:22.161 --> 24:24.831
<i>♪ Got a trailer on my Harley</i>

24:24.864 --> 24:26.999
So, uh, what
are we looking for?

24:27.033 --> 24:28.968
And please don't say
a dead body.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.803
Well, I-- I hope not.

24:30.837 --> 24:32.972
If he fell, he'd be up
on those rocks.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.440
You up for a climb?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.808
You bet.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.952
Grant?

24:48.655 --> 24:50.456
Grant Cutter, you here?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.391
<i>♪ Sittin' in the back

24:52.424 --> 24:54.561

25:01.868 --> 25:04.236
Oh, uh, can I help you?

25:04.270 --> 25:05.872
Yeah, we're
looking for Grant.

25:05.905 --> 25:08.074
Oh, sorry.
You just missed him.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.676
- You Scott?
- That's me.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.478
Grant said he was here all night
doing inventory.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.215
That's right. Is this about
what happened to his wife?

25:16.248 --> 25:18.417
Horrible.
Just horrible.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.686
- Were you with him?
- Yeah.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.520
Built three bikes, too.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.990
Did Grant step away last night
or take any calls?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.225
Just to get some pizzas.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.594
What time was that?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.762
Late.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.031
Wait, you don't think
that Grant did this?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.667
Look, Grant's a good man.
He loves Jody.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.836
Where is he now?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.037
He said he was headed over to
our shipping warehouse.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.072
- Great.
- Thank you.

25:41.407 --> 25:42.675
Tired of her
following me around,

25:42.709 --> 25:44.343
making these accusations.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.578
Just tell her to stop.
I'm not having it.

25:45.612 --> 25:46.946
Learn some manners
while you're at it.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.848
- That's your job as a parent.
- I don't appreciate the way

25:48.881 --> 25:50.617
- you're talking to me.
- I-I--

25:50.650 --> 25:52.118
What was that about?

25:52.151 --> 25:54.253
Well, uh, Luke
overheard you talking

25:54.286 --> 25:55.788
to Sunny about Paige,
and he thinks you're

25:55.822 --> 25:57.256
still suspicious about him.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.058
Well, yeah, I just think
that he's acting weird.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.128
What else did he say?

26:02.161 --> 26:04.296
You should, uh-- You should
mind your own business.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.865
- You see it, too, right?
- Oh, yes.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.900
But we don't know
the full story, so...

26:07.934 --> 26:09.736
What, you want me to stop?

26:11.170 --> 26:13.706
Fine. If you
want me to stop, I'll--

26:13.740 --> 26:15.374
I didn't say that.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.609
Did I?

26:16.643 --> 26:20.312
Okay. Nice.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.981
Look, your mum's
arriving tomorrow.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.816
Let's keep this secret
between us.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.484
You know how she gets.

26:25.517 --> 26:28.254
She wanted us
to do some bonding.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.289
- Gross.
- Her word, not mine.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.158
- I know.
- Anyway, point is,

26:32.191 --> 26:33.926
she thinks we're up here
riding horses, having fun,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.594
not looking
into some disappearance.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.164
So let's just keep this
on the down-low, shall we?

26:38.197 --> 26:40.132
I can do that.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.100
Good.

26:50.777 --> 26:52.511
What is this?

26:52.544 --> 26:55.147
It's a new recipe.
And also, you work too much.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.124
Mmm.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.426
This is really good, Donno.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.796
When are you putting it
on the menu?

27:09.829 --> 27:11.397
I'm not.
It's just for you.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.004
Sit down, Donno.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.779
You took a big risk
leaving the Bhullars

27:26.813 --> 27:28.981
and staying in Montana
here with me.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.317
And I want you to know
that I recognize the sacrifice

27:31.350 --> 27:33.820
that you made.

27:33.853 --> 27:36.188
You're the best partner
I could ever hope for.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.992
I know you don't like compliments,

27:40.026 --> 27:42.962
but it needed to be said.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.865
Okay, said. Moving on.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.633
<i>♪ Turn up the streetlights</i>

27:47.666 --> 27:50.369
So are we gonna
take the job?

27:50.402 --> 27:52.404
We can make that
decision together.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.673
- We don't do hits, your rules.
- It's not a hit.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.809
They're just asking us
to find people.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.911
Stage one.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.380
Stage two, we kill them.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.716
Stage three,
we dispose of the bodies.

28:03.750 --> 28:06.085
We don't get paid until after
stage three. Standard.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.321
Yeah. You're right.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.057
I'll do some research.

28:11.090 --> 28:14.761
Check these guys out,
then we can make the decision.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.462
Good thinking.

28:18.130 --> 28:20.099
What about Gigi?

28:20.132 --> 28:23.102
You know she's
Jenny Hoyt's mother.

28:23.135 --> 28:25.471
Uh-huh.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.742
You want to tell me
where you're going with that?

28:32.278 --> 28:34.113
I will.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.048
When I'm ready.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.789
Hey, what you got, Pop Star?

28:42.822 --> 28:43.689
<i>I'm at
the shipping warehouse now.</i>

28:43.722 --> 28:45.792
<i>They haven't seen
Grant all day.</i>

28:47.126 --> 28:50.062
He lied to Scott.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.065
All right. We're on our way
to the Cutter house.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.875
Sheriff's department.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.576
Grant?

29:04.610 --> 29:06.645
Autumn?

29:07.579 --> 29:10.482
Blood.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.319
Hoyt!

29:52.825 --> 29:53.993
Hoyt!

29:55.995 --> 29:57.329
Call an ambulance.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.998
I got a pulse.
He's still alive.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.339
Hey.

30:07.373 --> 30:08.841
Hey.
Any sign of Autumn?

30:08.875 --> 30:10.176
No, but I have
forensics looking

30:10.209 --> 30:11.510
into the blood
in Autumn's room.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.345
How's Grant?

30:13.379 --> 30:14.713
He's alive, barely.

30:14.746 --> 30:15.948
That knife wound
went really deep.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.383
All right,
so now that we've

30:17.416 --> 30:18.684
ruled him out,
where does that leave us?

30:18.717 --> 30:20.152
He's awake now.

30:24.390 --> 30:28.294
Hey, Grant,
can you hear us?

30:28.327 --> 30:29.795
Your daughter's
currently missing.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.797
Do you have any idea
where she could be?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.900
Yeah. Scott.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.367
Wait, what'd you say?

30:35.401 --> 30:38.137
Scott took her.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.006
Scott is in love
with her.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.641
I should've
listened to Jody.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.976
Call Poppernak,
get an address.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.377
I'm on it.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.582
Whew.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.420
Wait.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.123
I got something.

30:58.757 --> 31:00.726
It's blood.

31:00.759 --> 31:02.995
Yeah, probably a deer
ran off the cliff.

31:03.029 --> 31:06.032
There's no carcass.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.100
You think it's your
missing backpacker?

31:08.134 --> 31:09.201
Could be.
If you were gonna hide a body

31:09.235 --> 31:10.669
out here, how would you do it?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.439
Ooh, that's a hell of a question
to ask on a first date.

31:13.472 --> 31:15.207
Mm.

31:15.241 --> 31:18.844
I don't know, and, uh,
I hope I never find out.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.679
But you might want to look
over there.

31:24.450 --> 31:27.053
- Vultures.
- Yeah, something dead.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.754
I wanna look.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.690
That's a hike.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.792
We, uh, wouldn't get there till,
you know, after dark.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.461
Mom give you a curfew?

31:37.129 --> 31:39.198
You're not gonna make
this easy, are you?

31:39.231 --> 31:40.599
No.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.112
Sorry.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.614
Just looking
for my knife.

31:56.815 --> 31:57.984
Dropped it when--

31:58.017 --> 31:59.018
When you were running
away from me?

32:00.786 --> 32:02.154
Yeah.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.158
What do you want?

32:08.594 --> 32:11.930
I know that you spoke
with my stepfather.

32:11.964 --> 32:14.433
And I know that you think
I did something to Paige.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.570
Well, I didn't.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.506
Truth is, I don't know
what happened.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.274
You said that she left.

32:22.308 --> 32:24.110
Yeah, but there was
somebody else out there.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.280
Do you believe me?

32:29.881 --> 32:31.750
I don't know
what to believe.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.919
I would never do anything
to hurt Paige

32:33.952 --> 32:35.754
or anyone else,
for that matter.

32:35.787 --> 32:39.525
It's not who I am.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.961
But I just really, really
need you to stay out of this.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.464
You don't know
what you're dealing with.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.133
Okay.

33:03.749 --> 33:04.683
On scene now.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.031
The whole house
has been cleared.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.467
No sign of Scott or Autumn.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.169
Headed to the bike shop
to see if he shows there.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.536
We're gonna take a quick
look then head over

33:24.570 --> 33:26.072
to the Cutters'
for another pass.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.206
- Call me if you get anything.
- Yeah.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.476
So what?

33:30.509 --> 33:32.378
Jody discovers this guy
was creeping on her daughter

33:32.411 --> 33:35.181
and told him to stay away?

33:35.214 --> 33:37.015
Well, maybe he went over there
to get Autumn

33:37.049 --> 33:38.250
and ran into Jody instead.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.753
Hmm.

33:41.787 --> 33:43.555
That's weird.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.557
I used to, uh, build houses
with my uncle

33:45.591 --> 33:46.992
every summer
during high school.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.560
Not the time for another
one of your stories.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.029
No, listen,
there's something--

33:51.063 --> 33:52.664
there's something off
about this house.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.333
It's, uh-- I felt it
the moment I walked in.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.767
It's like the dimensions
are wrong.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.439
- Weird.
- Hm.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.945
I'm gonna take
a look upstairs.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.048
Right behind you.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.264
What the hell?

35:24.556 --> 35:26.124
Autumn.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.994
Hey. You okay?

35:29.027 --> 35:30.296
Autumn?

35:30.329 --> 35:32.164
Hey.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.166
Hey, you okay?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.602
I think
she's been drugged.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.204
We got to
get her out of here.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.774
Damn it.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.776
Hey, look at me.

35:44.810 --> 35:47.313
Autumn, did you see a key?

35:47.346 --> 35:48.780
This is my room.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.282
Did you see a key?

35:50.316 --> 35:53.118
He's been planning this
for years...

35:53.151 --> 35:54.620
since she was a child.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.808
Aaah!

36:47.806 --> 36:49.174
Ah, he got me.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.109
Hey.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.281
You okay?

36:55.314 --> 36:56.848
Hoyt!

37:14.733 --> 37:20.572
You know, uh, current objective
aside, today's been fun.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.341
- Maybe we could, uh--
- Look.

37:29.581 --> 37:34.152
It's Mark Woodman,
our missing backpacker.

37:46.365 --> 37:49.468
<i>♪ Wall eyes</i>

37:49.501 --> 37:53.305
Hey.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.140
<i>♪ Ceiling felt too high</i>

37:55.173 --> 37:57.943
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.913
He did all this
because of me.

38:01.947 --> 38:04.616
No, it's my fault.

38:04.650 --> 38:09.087
I should've protected
both of you, and I'm so sorry.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.558
<i>♪ Come back</i>

38:19.565 --> 38:22.468
<i>♪ Swallowed over the stage</i>

38:22.501 --> 38:25.804
Why does it feel like
the monsters always win

38:25.837 --> 38:27.339
even when we get them?

38:27.373 --> 38:29.608
Yeah. At least those two
have each other.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.777
Yeah.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.380
A loving dad can't protect you
from everything.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.148
But it goes a long way.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.451
We still talking
about them,

38:39.485 --> 38:40.786
or we talking about
somebody else?

38:40.819 --> 38:47.826
<i>♪ Turn the car on back home</i>

38:53.599 --> 38:56.334
I located the targets--
Paige and Luke.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.169
That was fast.
Where are they?

38:58.203 --> 38:59.838
Camping trip.

38:59.871 --> 39:02.974
They registered under
fake last names, but it's them.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.143
Huh. Sounds like they're
trying to lay low.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.079
Yeah,
they're bad at it.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.715
Which means
this should be easy.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.950
Your call.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.223
I have always wanted
to go camping.

39:18.256 --> 39:19.925
You think moving Walter
to another cabin

39:19.958 --> 39:21.893
is gonna solve things?

39:21.927 --> 39:24.863
Well, the creek cabin
is more isolated.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.399
No one to bother
for miles around.

39:27.433 --> 39:29.067
Tell you what--
I bet my beard

39:29.100 --> 39:30.536
he's got something to do
with these disappearances.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.704
That's not much of
a beard there, Bucky.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.239
I'm serious, damn it.

39:34.272 --> 39:35.907
Yeah, I know you are.

39:39.044 --> 39:43.715
Walter, time to go.

39:43.749 --> 39:45.116
Why'd you bring him here?

39:48.420 --> 39:50.055
Well, you can't
expect me to come help

39:50.088 --> 39:52.558
you move all by myself,
can you?

39:52.591 --> 39:55.126
I mean, your grandma always said
I had a head hard as an ox,

39:55.160 --> 39:57.629
but my back, now,
that's a different story.

39:57.663 --> 39:59.431
I don't want him here.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.032
- Now, Walter.
- Don't raise your voice

40:01.066 --> 40:02.734
to your mother like that.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.404
You do not belong here!

40:06.438 --> 40:07.906
You ungrateful little cur!

40:07.939 --> 40:10.141
Buck!

40:10.175 --> 40:11.543
I'd rather put a bullet
in your brain

40:11.577 --> 40:13.211
then watch you drag her down
for another second!

40:13.244 --> 40:14.913
Buck, get off of him!

40:14.946 --> 40:16.615
Get your hands-- Buck!

40:16.648 --> 40:18.216
Back off.

40:18.249 --> 40:21.152
Go on. Go on now.

40:21.186 --> 40:24.823
Now, Sunny,
you listen to me--

40:24.856 --> 40:26.792
No, you listen.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.495
That's my son, my child.

40:29.528 --> 40:32.731
And if you touch him again,
God help me,

40:32.764 --> 40:36.134
I'll bring down a cold hell
on your head, old man,

40:36.167 --> 40:38.403
the likes of which
you've never seen before.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.305
And you know I can.

40:40.338 --> 40:42.073
You just don't see it,
do ya?

40:42.107 --> 40:44.342
Or maybe you do
and you just don't care.

40:44.375 --> 40:47.212
But that boy is gonna be
the end of you someday, Sunny.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.849
You can count on it.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.066
I'm not leaving.

41:19.344 --> 41:20.579
Come here.

41:22.213 --> 41:24.182
Come here.

41:25.651 --> 41:29.487
That's a good boy.

41:47.038 --> 41:49.174
I love you, Walter.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.077
I really do.

42:17.468 --> 42:20.672
They're gone.

43:00.445 --> 43:01.980
