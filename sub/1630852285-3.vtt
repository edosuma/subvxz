00:01.135 --> 00:03.736
Joe: As a lifelong
refrigerator owner,

00:03.738 --> 00:08.273
Keeping food cold is something
I sometimes take for granted.

00:09.876 --> 00:15.347
However, if I were alive
100 years ago, in 1918,

00:15.349 --> 00:20.352
I would say thanks for each time
that my food didn't spoil.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.958
To preserve food in the summer,
ice had to be harvested

00:25.960 --> 00:29.227
During the winter
from frozen lakes and rivers.

00:29.229 --> 00:32.831
Merchants would saw out
giant slabs of ice,

00:32.833 --> 00:35.033
Package them in local sawdust,

00:35.035 --> 00:40.038
And ship them to ice houses
all over the place.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.041
Nowadays, in 2018,

00:43.043 --> 00:46.244
Refrigerators are more popular
than ever,

00:46.246 --> 00:52.184
And 15% of american households
even contain the second fridge.

00:52.186 --> 00:57.389
Those second fridges are a giant
waste of energy, like las vegas.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.925
Many of us in the midwest,
including myself,

01:00.927 --> 01:04.129
Happen to be part
of that 15%.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.264
Sorry.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.067
While the kitchen fridge
contains your immediate

01:09.069 --> 01:11.736
And basic needs,
the second fridge is where

01:11.738 --> 01:14.139
The fun stuff's kept --

01:14.141 --> 01:16.541
Meat you won in a raffle...

01:16.543 --> 01:18.142
Tenderloins.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.344
Alright,
see you assholes later.

01:19.346 --> 01:20.278
Love you guys.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.213
Joe: ...A box of pizza.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.081
You were too lazy to wrap up

01:23.083 --> 01:25.317
After your brother's
poker night.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.457
A soda to drink
while you study italian.

01:35.362 --> 01:41.467
But the mvp of any second
fridge is...Beer.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.307
Aw, shoot.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.044
Aw, shoot.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.251
Uh...Shoot.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.255
[ sighs ]

02:03.257 --> 02:05.323
I should have expected this.

02:05.325 --> 02:09.327
A few of my neighbors have been
victims of garage surfing --

02:09.329 --> 02:13.265
A form of mischief where teens
sneak into unlocked garages

02:13.267 --> 02:16.134
And raid the second fridge
for beer.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.139
Or if they're desperate,
hard cider.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.074
It's a fact.

02:22.076 --> 02:26.211
Teens can upset even the most
controlled environment.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.813
In this case, my second fridge.

02:28.815 --> 02:33.952
I can keep it stocked and clean
and set the 38 degrees.

02:33.954 --> 02:39.291
But if people that age
want to pilfer my pilsners...

02:39.293 --> 02:42.294
I guess that in my years
as a teacher,

02:42.296 --> 02:44.697
I have learned
that getting upset at them

02:44.699 --> 02:48.901
For stuff like this
is a huge waste of energy.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.904
Again, like las vegas.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.241
At the same time, they can
occasionally put you

02:56.243 --> 02:59.978
In a real tough spot,
like yesterday when

02:59.980 --> 03:02.046
Nicole melsky disrupted
my lesson on

03:02.048 --> 03:06.651
The medieval spanish carol
"riu riu chiu."

03:06.653 --> 03:08.520
I get it.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.322
Saying swears is popular.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.592
But unless you tear
a ligament in your foot,

03:13.594 --> 03:15.527
Unnecessary.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.201
I didn't want to have
to do this,

03:23.203 --> 03:26.004
Especially on
a Friday, nicole,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.073
But you used
profanity at me

03:28.075 --> 03:30.476
In front of
the other students.

03:34.681 --> 03:36.548
I wanted to tell her,
but couldn't,

03:36.550 --> 03:39.952
That, like stand up comedians,
teachers need to address

03:39.954 --> 03:44.889
Hecklers or else the illusion
of control will be shattered.

03:44.891 --> 03:49.428
Then again, is peace in the
classroom as fragile as that?

03:49.430 --> 03:53.898
The fear of punishment
what holds things together?

03:53.900 --> 03:58.404
Same as nicole, I would have
rather been anywhere else.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.183
Principal neiman,
sorry to bother you.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.851
Hey, joe, come in.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.621
I'm just buying some ink.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.728
Nicole, back so soon?

04:23.730 --> 04:25.730
Perhaps I should just start
putting you on my

04:25.732 --> 04:27.132
Daily schedule.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.667
Wait, what?

04:28.669 --> 04:30.535
She was here yesterday.

04:30.537 --> 04:34.539
I believe that makes
the fourth time this month.

04:34.541 --> 04:39.611
Now, what warrants this visit,
miss melsky?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.080
Mr. Pera?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.282
First of all,
I just want to say

04:44.284 --> 04:47.486
That nicole is normally a joy
to have in class.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.088
She tries real hard
and is one of my most

04:50.090 --> 04:51.623
Dependable altos.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.360
But today, I caught her passing
around this party sized bag

04:55.362 --> 04:57.496
Of sour cream
and onion chips.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.097
Chips?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.500
[ sighs ] go on.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.703
When I asked her
to put them away, she said,

05:04.705 --> 05:07.772
"okay, mr. Pera-balls."

05:07.774 --> 05:11.309
"uh, it's just mr. Pera,"
I said.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.180
To which she responded,

05:15.182 --> 05:18.116
"teachers are...

05:18.118 --> 05:20.252
Bullshit."

05:20.254 --> 05:22.521
The "b-s" word.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.389
Might I remind you,
young lady,

05:24.391 --> 05:26.791
That you are a student
at little deer middle school

05:26.793 --> 05:29.394
And not chef gordon ramsay?

05:29.396 --> 05:32.197
Please take a seat,
nicole.

05:33.467 --> 05:34.466
[ beep ]

05:34.468 --> 05:36.000
Denise:
<i> Yes, principal neiman?</i>

05:36.002 --> 05:38.803
Denise, will you get the melskys
on the line for me?

05:38.805 --> 05:41.206
I'm going to see if they'll
come in around sixth period.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.607
<i> Sure thing.</i>
Oh, my god.

05:42.609 --> 05:46.011
Mr. Pera, I'd like you
to be here, too, if you can.

05:51.618 --> 05:53.285
Just leave them
at the desk.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.754
We'll dispose of
them properly.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.156
Joe: Sending a student
to the principal's office,

05:58.158 --> 06:03.161
Or the cooler, as some teachers
and students have nicknamed it,

06:03.163 --> 06:04.563
Does not feel good.

06:04.565 --> 06:07.900
And it feels worse when that
student occasionally

06:07.902 --> 06:09.101
Looks after your dog.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.302
[ muffled ]
close the door, sheldon.

06:10.304 --> 06:12.170
My nips are getting hard.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.239
Sorry.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.241
I was just thinking
about how crime

06:16.243 --> 06:18.510
Is statistically proven
to decline in winter

06:18.512 --> 06:22.581
And that maybe if we kept
the school at 38 degrees,

06:22.583 --> 06:25.049
The students would be
too cold to misbehave.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.184
What?!

06:26.186 --> 06:27.852
It was cold
in that movie "fargo",

06:27.854 --> 06:30.255
But they still put
the guy in the chipper.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.324
[ laughs ]

06:32.326 --> 06:35.394
Woman: Everything
all right, joe?

06:35.396 --> 06:37.462
I just wish
my neighbor's daughter

06:37.464 --> 06:39.998
Didn't swear at me in class
because now they're going to

06:40.000 --> 06:41.333
Come in for a meeting.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.335
Probably will have
to leave work to do it.

06:43.337 --> 06:46.538
And it's not going
to be pretty.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.274
My man. You got
to lay down the law.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.742
I sent home two
so far this week.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.811
Aiming to get a hat trick
before the day's over.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.479
Let's not use
hockey terminology

06:54.481 --> 06:55.747
In reference
to the kids.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.483
Well, if these goons
want to face off against me,

06:58.485 --> 07:01.085
I'm gonna sent their ass
to the penalty box.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.354
[ whistle blows ]

07:02.356 --> 07:04.222
Go to the penalty box,
you no good kids!

07:04.224 --> 07:06.291
Joe: Thank goodness students
can't see into

07:06.293 --> 07:08.160
The teacher's lounge
because it proved

07:08.162 --> 07:10.362
What nicole sensed is true,

07:10.364 --> 07:14.499
That many adults should not
be making/enforcing rules.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.235
Yeah, it could use
a good vacuuming.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.038
In good circumstances,
teachers do like to teach

07:20.040 --> 07:22.240
And students like to learn.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.376
It just gets hard
when outside stuff

07:24.378 --> 07:25.978
Makes its way into school.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.246
Principal neiman?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.848
Nicole!

07:29.850 --> 07:32.317
Neiman: Mr. And mrs. Melsky,
thank you so much for coming in.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.118
I am so sorry,
principal.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.188
This one has had
a real piss poor attitude

07:36.190 --> 07:37.589
Lately, hasn't she?

07:37.591 --> 07:38.857
Gee, I wonder where
she gets it from.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.525
I'll tell you
where she gets it from,

07:40.527 --> 07:41.926
Is that odd future
you've been listening to.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.395
Well, guess what,
sweetheart?

07:43.397 --> 07:44.997
No more spotify premium
until you start acting

07:44.999 --> 07:46.264
Like a good kid.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.732
Mr. Melsky, I understand
that you are upset.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.401
God damn right
I'm upset!

07:49.403 --> 07:51.536
I'm about to break your
computer with my head.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.005
Great. Then I'll have to
drive you to the hospital.

07:53.007 --> 07:55.540
Already have
to drive you everywhere.

07:55.542 --> 07:59.344
Four times, nicole!
I just -- you know what?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.079
I'm going to need
the full story here.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.015
Joe.
It's all fine.

08:03.017 --> 08:05.284
Mr. Pera...

08:07.087 --> 08:10.422
I asked the students to take out
their sheet music for

08:10.424 --> 08:12.891
"riu riu chiu."
what?

08:12.893 --> 08:16.028
It's a villancico
from the 16th century.

08:16.030 --> 08:18.763
What?
Cut to the chase, joe.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.765
Nicole was eating
chips in class.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.435
I asked her to stop.
She called me mr. "pera-balls."

08:23.437 --> 08:25.504
And then said
teachers are bullshit.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.172
[ laughs ]
what?!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.641
Hey, hey, we do not condone
any of that kind of

08:29.643 --> 08:31.043
Language in
the melsky sphere,

08:31.045 --> 08:33.378
And we will be
doing repercussions.

08:33.380 --> 08:36.381
So, you know,
maybe we start drug testing

08:36.383 --> 08:37.782
Or do military school.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.518
Mr. Melsky...

08:39.520 --> 08:41.186
Joe: As your friend
and neighbor

08:41.188 --> 08:43.455
Who has also
baby-sat for you,

08:43.457 --> 08:46.258
I'm familiar with the layout
of your house

08:46.260 --> 08:48.126
And know that nicole
shares a bedroom

08:48.128 --> 08:50.729
With her younger sister,
kelsey.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.598
Perhaps you could consider
turning the basement

08:53.600 --> 08:58.937
Into a bedroom for her so she'd
have some space in her own.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.004
Get out.
Mike.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.075
We got it from here, joe.
Thank you.

09:03.077 --> 09:04.877
Who's gonna
pay for that?

09:04.879 --> 09:07.880
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I need --
I'm gonna chill out, alright?

09:07.882 --> 09:09.347
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.816
Joe: I wish there was something
I could tell nicole,

09:11.818 --> 09:15.754
But unless you're an adult
who gets it, like say,

09:15.756 --> 09:19.824
Billie joe armstrong,
it will fall on deaf teen ears.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.094
Dude, you would not believe
what happened last night.

09:22.096 --> 09:24.196
Checking my security
cam footage.

09:28.569 --> 09:32.036
Uh, just wait a second.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.906
Okay.

09:38.379 --> 09:40.379
They got me, too.

09:40.381 --> 09:42.380
Just beer though, right?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.048
At least they didn't get
our power tools.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.851
I hope they put those pigs
in guantanamo bay.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.854
Kids that age will test
even the best of us.

09:49.856 --> 09:52.324
But they also learn
from how we respond.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.459
So maybe we cut 'em
some slack.

09:54.461 --> 09:57.195
As long as he didn't drink them
and then drive a car.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.798
You better hope that those punks
didn't rat you out to the fbi

09:59.800 --> 10:01.866
Because you're jeffrey dahmer
looking ass looks like

10:01.868 --> 10:03.535
You got a fridge full
of fingers and feet.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.203
That's not true.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.005
Anyway, I'm sorry
about my kid.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.540
Turns out we are
going to move her

10:08.542 --> 10:10.475
Into the basement
after all.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.945
Hey, kelsey or nicole!

10:14.548 --> 10:17.282
Got something you want to say
to the music man?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.217
Sorry.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.820
It's chill.

10:21.822 --> 10:25.423
I don't have any sour cream
and onion chips to offer you.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.825
But, uh...

10:26.827 --> 10:31.896
Would you like a tall boy
of tomato juice?

10:31.898 --> 10:33.766
Uh, I'm fine.

10:33.768 --> 10:36.368
Yeah.

10:36.370 --> 10:39.772
Tomato juice is bullshit.

10:41.175 --> 10:43.575
[ chuckles ]

10:43.577 --> 10:45.577
That wasn't the best joke,

10:45.579 --> 10:47.712
But I was attempting
to let nicole know

10:47.714 --> 10:50.248
That even though I am bound
to the rules set forth

10:50.250 --> 10:54.186
By the school as a teacher,
outside, on my own,

10:54.188 --> 10:56.188
I am able to choose lenience,

10:56.190 --> 10:59.391
Which makes me think,
maybe installing a lock

10:59.393 --> 11:00.793
Is not the right move.

11:00.795 --> 11:03.996
Perhaps I should instead
attach a document to my fridge

11:03.998 --> 11:08.133
Detailing alcohol's effects
on brain development.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.535
That way, the teen --
