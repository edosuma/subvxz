                       Vera!

10:47.848 --> 10:50.982
           (panting):
    Hey, vera, hey. Wake up.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.884
Oh!

10:57.958 --> 10:59.691
          Oh, god, no.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.694
             Oh...

11:13.707 --> 11:15.940
           (panting)

11:23.250 --> 11:24.949
                 Joshua. Joshua.
           Did someone call 911?

11:24.951 --> 11:26.418
            What's going on?

11:27.688 --> 11:28.987
 I don't think he has a pulse.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.459
Maybe it was
a heart attack.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.899
                        Michael!

11:42.202 --> 11:44.703
       (panting):
        Vera...

11:44.705 --> 11:47.972
Are you okay?
             I'm fine, i'm fine.
                  I must have...

11:47.974 --> 11:50.408
      Must have been dehydrated.
Okay, hold on,
just stay sitting.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.011
I called 911.
         No, no, call them back.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.013
               I'm fine.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.915
Are you sure?
   Yeah, i'm fine, i'm fine.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.249
Because my name's alan.

11:58.251 --> 12:02.053
When you woke up,
you said "michael."

12:02.055 --> 12:04.139
 Look, we have to go figure out
      what the hell it was

12:04.140 --> 12:06.224
That fell down over the horizon.
No, just take a second.
I'm gonna grab you some water.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.760
Just...
                  Let's go.

12:08.762 --> 12:11.996
         (siren blares)
   (indistinct radio chatter)

12:11.998 --> 12:14.399
Easy. Let me get
the legs free.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.504
           What are her vitals?

12:19.506 --> 12:22.273
  Nothing. She's gone.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.909
       (gasping breaths)
stay down!
Don't move!

12:26.079 --> 12:28.079
       Amy. Where's amy?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.215
      Where's my daughter?
       Where is she? Amy?
Ma'am, please!

12:30.217 --> 12:32.350
      Amy!

12:32.352 --> 12:34.753
           Paramedic:
  Female, critical condition.

12:34.755 --> 12:38.056
          Let go! Amy!
Please, ma'am,
come back.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.425
              Man:
       Get us some help!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.132
                      (coughing)

12:49.069 --> 12:51.369
           (coughing)

12:55.242 --> 12:56.875
           Let's go.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.010
       What the hell?

12:59.012 --> 13:01.112
         What happened?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.948
       We thought you were dead.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.818
    (high-pitched whirring)
        (grunts in pain)

13:06.820 --> 13:09.087
          Male voice:
    <i> Remember the training. </i>
      You all right there?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.956
    <i> It's three to the chest.</i>

13:11.958 --> 13:14.092
            What's wrong, buddy?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.261
           It's just a headache.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.730
         Nah, you're all right--
     it's just been a tough day.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.198
     Male voice: <i> Isabel...</i>
  <i> We're doing this for you. </i>
        (groans in pain)

13:21.201 --> 13:24.102
     <i> Three to the chest. </i>
     Who's... Who's isabel?

13:24.104 --> 13:25.804
            Isabel?
  What are you talking about?

13:25.806 --> 13:28.106
  She's my wife. How the hell
     do you know her name?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.107
                Whoa, slow down,
                      slow down.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.809
We're all on the same team here.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.143
               You're gonna kill
                 me, aren't you?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.845
              Three shots to the
                   chest, right?
No,

13:33.847 --> 13:34.846
   Nobody's killing anybody.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.114
He knows--
what's it matter?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.849
  Yeah, we're gonna kill you.

13:39.019 --> 13:41.186
           You want to do this?!

13:41.188 --> 13:43.087
                 Just let me go.

13:43.089 --> 13:45.824
                            Man:
                No! Don't do it!

13:45.826 --> 13:48.059
      (gunshots, grunting)

13:51.298 --> 13:53.898
         (crows cawing)

14:00.841 --> 14:02.173
           (gasping)

14:02.175 --> 14:04.843
              (panting)
baby! What happened?

14:04.845 --> 14:06.544
Are you okay?
Hey, talk to me.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.846
Baby, what's wrong?
What happened?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.548
                     Talk to me.
We thought you were gone.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.450
  I need to make a broadcast.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.885
            Tonight.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.888
Anything, son.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.123
We must share our miracle.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.564
             Excuse me.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.500
  Hey, can you... Can you please
        tell me what's going on?

14:29.502 --> 14:31.569
    She's still in surgery.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.005
We'll know
something soon.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.477
          Where the hell is she?
                Where's amy?

14:39.479 --> 14:42.080
                       It was an
                       accident.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.983
                   It was...
Nothing's ever
your fault, is it?

14:46.953 --> 14:49.087
        Our daughter is in here,

14:49.089 --> 14:51.089
        And this is what you do?
 You did this!

14:51.091 --> 14:53.458
            Ronnie:
         You did this!
 She's in here because of you!

14:53.460 --> 14:56.194
 The police report's gonna say
       you were drinking,

14:56.196 --> 14:57.896
        Again.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.898
            But that's not true.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.934
It's true if i say it's true.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.969
          Don't do this, ronnie.
I swear to god, erin,

15:04.971 --> 15:06.905
                  If she dies...

15:15.081 --> 15:16.681
        (crying quietly)

15:16.683 --> 15:18.683
              Man:
     <i> So, i know high school</i>

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
Can be a difficult
time, peter,

15:20.553 --> 15:23.421
And you sometimes
feel hopeless.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.689
       Hopeless?
Yeah.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.691
About the present
or the future.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.994
     Is this how you interrogate
        people who almost drown?

15:29.996 --> 15:33.498
Your previous suicide attempt
is in your file, peter.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.066
   That was a long time ago.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.268
    It doesn't have anything
       to do with today.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.937
             I was swimming, and
          the next thing i know,

15:38.939 --> 15:39.938
          I'm coughing up water.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.706
           That's the end of it.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.409
                 I have practice
                tomorrow, early.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.411
We'll need to notify
one of your parents,

15:46.413 --> 15:48.146
Then you can go.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.549
Notify the group foster home...

15:51.551 --> 15:53.618
         Where i live.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.989
                  Or is that not
                   in your file?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.266
  (bird screeches in distance)

16:22.148 --> 16:25.149
       Definitely calling
         the cops, bro.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.986
     I seem to find myself
    in need of some clothes.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.623
Not sure i can help you.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.525
         But i insist.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.064
    I understand completely.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.033
                Yes, absolutely.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.601
            Thanks.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.403
        It's so strange.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.572
             What?
            Houston says they've
           got it under control.

16:47.574 --> 16:48.706
I mean, they're 700 miles away.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.609
     So maybe they know
    something we don't.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.411
 It's a meteor event-- i mean,
 it's definitely our territory.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.413
Yeah, well, if it is
a meteor, then, you know,

16:55.415 --> 16:57.615
 It'll still be there tomorrow.
                Alan, the energy

16:57.617 --> 16:59.417
From the impact knocked me out.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.719
                   That's weird.
         Did i just try
       to advise caution?

17:01.721 --> 17:03.788
I'm sorry.
My mistake.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.089
       Whatever it is...

17:06.092 --> 17:08.526
         We're gonna be
     the ones who find it.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.751
      Maybe it was just me
        being panicked,

17:33.753 --> 17:35.720
       But... I couldn't
        find your pulse.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.423
   My heart's still beating,
           obviously.
No, i can see that.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.325
          I'm just...
   It was still pretty scary.

            Newsman:
       Government sources

         Are telling us
       that you can thank

17:46.566 --> 17:48.800
      A giant solar flare
   for a burst of radiation,

17:48.802 --> 17:51.469
 Which disrupted radio signals
     across america today,

17:51.471 --> 17:54.105
 Causing cell phones, computers

17:54.107 --> 17:56.474
  And various small electronic
  devices to go on the fritz.

17:56.476 --> 17:59.310
    Currently, it's 3:00...
             What?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.412
    It wasn't a solar flare.
  And what government source?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.247
 We're the government sources.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.417
  I mean... Who told the news
     it was a solar flare?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.719
   Why are you looking at me?
 I was with you the whole time.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.154
  It definitely made impact--

18:10.156 --> 18:12.457
    Why don't they just say
     that it was a meteor?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.326
    Please let it be aliens.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.527
         No. Not again.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.396
           Seriously?
A guy mistakes
a drone

18:18.398 --> 18:20.665
       For a ufo one time
 and he loses all credibility?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.300
   I'm turning up the radio.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.769

         just happened

19:32.472 --> 19:35.273

       a second. Just...

19:45.652 --> 19:48.319
             This is incredible.
You're telling <i> me.</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:55.393
         Whoa. The sand's melted
              from extreme heat.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.962
       It's like tektite.
                     That's what
                   i'm thinking.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.530
        And that smell.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.666
       Definitely sulfur.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.534
       Exactly.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.671
      That plus melting...
        Suggests it was

20:06.673 --> 20:08.573
                       A meteor.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.341
          Yeah, but...

20:10.343 --> 20:11.976
Doesn't the location of trinity
          feel, like,

20:11.978 --> 20:13.844
A little
too convenient, no?

20:13.846 --> 20:16.480
         Like what, you think it
        was aimed like a weapon?

20:16.482 --> 20:19.250
I mean, it's either
another weapons test,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.419
Or someone is trying
to make a point.
             Yeah, but we traced

20:21.421 --> 20:23.287
             The trajectory-- it
         didn't come from earth.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.956

               those impurities,

28:51.797 --> 28:53.997
               We can figure out
                   what this is.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.300
         You sure you don't want
           me to drive you home?

28:56.302 --> 28:57.835
        No.

                      about you.

28:59.472 --> 29:03.073
           Generally, because of
       the emotional detachment,

29:03.075 --> 29:05.142

             of the passing out.

            is this michael guy?

29:51.490 --> 29:56.260
        We counsel hope,
    not fire and brimstone.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.128
     I have a new message.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.164
       What you're saying
      could bring us down.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.033
        This has nothing
        to do with you.
The hell it doesn't.

30:03.035 --> 30:07.304
  This new message of yours...

30:07.306 --> 30:09.173
If you continue this sacrilege,

30:09.175 --> 30:11.508
    You will not be welcome
         in my church.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.182
     It's not your church.

30:20.152 --> 30:23.854
       It's god's church.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.923
           So be it.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.509
      (crickets chirping)

30:51.951 --> 30:55.118
        (brakes squeak,
       hand brake creaks)

31:19.879 --> 31:22.579
           (creaking)

31:30.656 --> 31:33.357
           I figured
     you needed some light.

31:35.427 --> 31:37.461
        This is loaded.
          Don't move.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.364
     I don't need to move.

31:40.366 --> 31:43.367
       You'll come to me.

31:49.575 --> 31:52.476
What do you want?
       You've been chosen, vera.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.244
       Look, i don't know
         what you think

31:54.246 --> 31:56.413
  You're gonna get, johnny...
             That isn't my name.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.483
     These clothes were...

31:59.485 --> 32:01.218
            A gift.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.687
   Then who are you?
                        Who i am
                 doesn't matter.

32:03.689 --> 32:06.256
        What matters...

32:06.258 --> 32:08.025
        Is what i know.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.427
I'm calling the cops.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.162
      It's about your son.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.300
 What do you know about my son?

32:16.302 --> 32:19.369
     Look at your computer.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.438
                     Look at it.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.624
         (quick exhale)

32:40.626 --> 32:43.327
Michael.

32:43.329 --> 32:45.395
  That's from just last week.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.037
          He's alive.
          He's alive.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.008
                     Mi-michael.
                     Mi-michael.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.244
         He's grown up,

33:01.246 --> 33:03.380
           Hasn't he?

33:03.382 --> 33:06.316
                 I know who took
                him. I know why.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.051
          You tell me.

33:08.053 --> 33:09.353
You tell me
who took him.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.488
    What did you do to him?

33:12.725 --> 33:15.292
             Don't worry, angel.

33:15.294 --> 33:18.128
         I can tell you
    where to find your son.

33:18.130 --> 33:22.466
    You just need to finish
      a job for me first.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.433
                  (woman crying)

33:23.435 --> 33:25.502
           (knocking)

33:27.606 --> 33:29.406
      Honey, what's wrong?

33:31.110 --> 33:33.610
Joshua sr.:
Joshua, we need
to talk.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.315
         What is this?

33:38.317 --> 33:40.784
  Try to see it as a blessing.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.320
         For all of us.

33:43.322 --> 33:46.023
       Charlotte, what's
       he talking about?

33:49.361 --> 33:51.495
You were on retreat.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.098
And i was weak
and he tried to comfort me.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.708
 Whether the baby's your son...

34:04.710 --> 34:07.411
       Or your brother...

34:07.413 --> 34:09.312
       He's still family.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.617
I'm so sorry.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.092
  ♪ hey, y'all, come on out ♪

34:23.094 --> 34:25.795
      ♪ just out of town,
    meet up in the country ♪

34:25.797 --> 34:27.230
      ♪ down south in...♪

34:27.232 --> 34:29.299
         (music stops)

34:36.375 --> 34:38.442
            (grunts)

34:40.344 --> 34:44.114
       <i> Cesar, it's raul.</i>

34:44.116 --> 34:48.085
 Yo, you got to give me a call
 as soon as you get this, man.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.587
        Some bad stuff's
      going down. Just...

34:50.589 --> 34:52.656
     Try to lay low, okay?

35:02.835 --> 35:05.102
           (grunting)

35:11.577 --> 35:13.110
             Erin:
     <i> You sure you're okay?</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:15.112
     You don't feel funny?

35:15.114 --> 35:17.114
                     Mom, i keep
                saying i'm fine.

35:17.116 --> 35:19.616
Okay, okay. Do you want
    anything to eat?

35:19.618 --> 35:21.218
Some delicious fishes?

35:25.491 --> 35:26.756
                        Cashier:
                     It's $2.63.

35:26.758 --> 35:30.193
Thank you.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.475
                    Okay, kiddo.
                       Let's go.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.677
         Hey, come on.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.440
Erin:
What are you...
            (grunts)

36:19.878 --> 36:22.212
                  You stay calm,
                 you stay quiet.

36:22.213 --> 36:24.547
 I'm not gonna hurt you and i'm
not gonna hurt your little girl.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.349
             I just need a ride.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.485
       And then i'll let you go.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.487
            Nod you agree, okay.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.556
                         Nod you
                    agree, okay.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.492
                      Okay, shh.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.561
                     Go. Go, go.
                          Drive.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.566
            The man:
       <i> It should be easy.</i>

36:42.568 --> 36:44.501
She's already basically dead.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.671
She has been
for seven years.

36:47.673 --> 36:50.340
Killing her would be a mercy.

36:50.342 --> 36:51.675
                  This is crazy.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.809
      You realize you're insane.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.644
           Why do you want this?

36:54.646 --> 36:56.813
If you had a chance
to kill a mass murderer,

36:56.815 --> 36:58.215
Would you take it?

36:58.217 --> 37:00.717
            What are you saying?
          I-i mean, what is she?

37:00.719 --> 37:02.619
She's a threat.
                 To who?

37:02.621 --> 37:04.521
                 To you?
To everything.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.958
            Then do it yourself.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.428
I can find someone else.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.963
     Just... Don't... Just stop.

37:12.965 --> 37:15.966
               Take another step
                  and i swear...

37:15.968 --> 37:18.235
    You swear?

37:18.670 --> 37:19.970
You swear what?

37:21.340 --> 37:22.939
You won't kill me.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.508
Because killing me

37:25.510 --> 37:27.677
Kills your son.

37:29.314 --> 37:32.649
It kills the only possibility
of ever seeing him again.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.989
    I am...

37:38.991 --> 37:41.258
     Your only hope.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.702
        Don't be scared.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.571
     I'm not.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.640
Good, i didn't
think so.

37:56.642 --> 37:58.675
      You're pretty tough.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.677
                  My brother has
                   a little girl

38:00.679 --> 38:03.480
         Just like you.
       Her name's nadia.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.382
Where are we going?

38:05.384 --> 38:06.616
       Honey, don't talk to him.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.984
     Why not?

38:11.923 --> 38:13.590
            Houston.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.458
We're gonna
go to houston.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.027
   That's lucky.

38:17.029 --> 38:18.495
         That's lucky?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.430
         Honey, don't.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.699
We were going there anyway.
It's lucky you picked us.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.567
       Amy, what did i just say?

38:24.569 --> 38:26.636
             Stop talking to him
            and do your drawing.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.479
Why are you going to houston?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.616
      Nadia and her daddy
        are in houston.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.486
Need to make sure they're okay.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.027
You on the run, buddy?

38:51.029 --> 38:52.362
            No, sir.

38:52.364 --> 38:55.365
I believe you. Why not?

38:55.367 --> 38:56.866
Houston all right?

38:56.868 --> 38:58.335
       Sounds good to me.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.502
Come on,
let's go.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.918
            The man:
     <i> Vera, you experienced</i>

39:14.920 --> 39:17.787
          <i> Things today</i>
     <i> you don't understand.</i>

39:17.789 --> 39:20.490
   <i> You're trying to deny it,</i>

39:20.492 --> 39:22.559
        <i> But you feel it.</i>

39:24.596 --> 39:26.429
       <i> Nothing is random.</i>

39:26.431 --> 39:30.600
   <i> Nothing is a coincidence.</i>

39:30.602 --> 39:33.436
    <i> Everything is happening</i>
         <i> for a reason.</i>

39:33.438 --> 39:38.007
          <i> And you have</i>
   <i> an important part to play.</i>

39:43.949 --> 39:46.750
          (whooshing)

40:13.011 --> 40:15.545
         (horn blares)

40:15.547 --> 40:17.881
       Driver: Hey, you can't...
           (honking)

40:17.883 --> 40:19.783
                       Driver 2:
        Come on, buddy, come on.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.451
            I died.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.520
       And yet here i am.

40:26.024 --> 40:27.157
              Why?

40:27.159 --> 40:30.026
     (honking in distance)

40:30.028 --> 40:32.095
     I bring you a warning.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.732
   The devil is here with us,

40:35.734 --> 40:37.801
      In flesh and blood.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.606
      He knows our secrets
         and our fears.

40:43.608 --> 40:47.076
And he will use them against us.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.046
   He is temptation and sin.

40:50.048 --> 40:53.016
     He is evil incarnate.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.084
         He is lucifer,

40:55.086 --> 40:58.021
    The prince of darkness.

40:58.023 --> 41:00.056
  And i am here to tell you--

41:00.058 --> 41:03.793
Whether you believe it or not--

41:03.795 --> 41:07.931
    He is coming for us all.
