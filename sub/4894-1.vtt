02:28.090 --> 02:29.690
<i>So where are you?</i>

02:29.930 --> 02:31.730
<i>You're in some motel room.</i>

02:31.970 --> 02:33.890
<i>You just wake up and you're in...</i>

02:34.130 --> 02:36.170
<i>in a motel room. There's the key.</i>

02:36.410 --> 02:39.770
<i>It feels like maybe it's the first time</i>
<i>you've been here but...</i>

02:40.010 --> 02:42.330
<i>perhaps you've been there for a week...</i>

02:42.570 --> 02:44.890
<i>three months, it's...</i>

02:45.130 --> 02:47.090
<i>It's kind of hard to say, I... I don't know.</i>

02:47.330 --> 02:50.850
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

02:50.970 --> 02:55.530
This guy. He's here already.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.330
Lenny!

02:57.570 --> 03:00.850
It's Leonard.

03:00.890 --> 03:05.490
- Like I told you before.
- Did you? I must have forgot.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.490
I guess I've already told you
about my condition.

03:07.730 --> 03:11.810
Oh, well, only every time I see you.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.250
- My car.
- This is your car.

03:21.490 --> 03:24.450
Oh, you're in a playful mood.

03:24.450 --> 03:29.690
- It's not good to make fun of a handicap.
- Just trying to have a little fun.

03:34.890 --> 03:39.370
- Roll up your window.
- Hm?

03:42.610 --> 03:45.730
- It's broken.
- I can get that fixed for you.

03:45.970 --> 03:48.770
- So, where to, Sherlock?
- I got a lead on a place.

03:49.010 --> 03:52.010
- What the hell you wanna go there for?
- You know it?

03:52.250 --> 03:55.890
Yeah, it's just this fucked up building.
Why do you wanna go there?

03:56.130 --> 03:59.610
Don't remember.

04:16.050 --> 04:21.529
- Looks like somebody's home.
- Ah, that thing's been here for years.

04:23.290 --> 04:26.290
What are you talking about?
These tracks are only a few days old.

04:26.530 --> 04:30.010
Tracks? What are you, Pocahontas?

04:30.250 --> 04:33.130
Come on.

04:39.050 --> 04:42.730
Let's take a look inside.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.970
<i>Teddy.</i>

05:00.210 --> 05:04.050
<i>Don't believe his lies.</i>
<i>He is the one. Kill him.</i>

05:04.290 --> 05:06.090
<i>I've finally found him.</i>

05:06.330 --> 05:09.290
<i>How long have I been looking?</i>

05:09.530 --> 05:11.690
Find anything?

05:11.930 --> 05:13.730
Didn't think so.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.090
Let's go, huh?

05:15.330 --> 05:18.370
Oh, fuck this.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.770
You're gonna pay for what you did.

05:21.010 --> 05:25.410
Beg forgiveness and then you pay.

05:27.450 --> 05:30.130
You don't have a clue, you freak!

05:30.370 --> 05:33.850
Beg my wife's forgiveness
before I blow your brains out.

05:34.090 --> 05:36.770
Leonard, you don't know what's going on.

05:37.010 --> 05:39.210
- You don't even know my name.
- Teddy.

05:39.450 --> 05:41.370
Cos you read it off a fucking picture.

05:41.610 --> 05:44.610
You don't know who you are.

05:44.850 --> 05:49.050
- I'm Leonard Shelby from San Francisco.
- That's who you were. That's not...

05:49.290 --> 05:50.970
what you've become.

05:51.210 --> 05:54.490
- Shut your mouth.
- You want to know, Lenny? Come on.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.530
Come on, let's go down to the basement.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.450
Let's go down, you and me together.

05:59.690 --> 06:04.250
Then you'll know who you really are.

06:05.850 --> 06:09.330
- No!

06:09.370 --> 06:11.170
<i>It's just an anonymous room.</i>

06:11.410 --> 06:13.650
<i>There's nothing in the drawers.</i>
<i>But you look anyway.</i>

06:13.890 --> 06:16.090
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bible...</i>

06:16.330 --> 06:19.890
<i> which I, of course, read religiously.</i>
<i>Hm.</i>

06:20.130 --> 06:24.770
<i>You know who you are</i>
<i>and you know kind of all about yourself.</i>

06:25.010 --> 06:29.610
<i>But just for day-to-day stuff,</i>
<i>notes are really useful.</i>

06:29.850 --> 06:34.410
<i>Sammy Jankis had the same problem</i>
<i>but he really had no system.</i>

06:34.650 --> 06:38.650
<i>He wrote himself a ridiculous amount of notes</i>
<i>but he'd get them all mixed up.</i>

06:38.890 --> 06:40.770
<i>You really do need a system if...</i>

06:41.010 --> 06:44.770
<i>if you're gonna make it work.</i>

07:35.610 --> 07:37.290
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:37.530 --> 07:40.490
- I'm Mr Shelby from 304.
- What can I do for you, Leonard?

07:40.730 --> 07:42.370
- Um...
- Burt.

07:42.610 --> 07:45.650
Burt. I'm not sure, 
I think I may have asked you to hold my calls.

07:45.890 --> 07:48.450
- You don't know?
- I'm not too good on the phone.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.210
You said you like to look people in the eye
when you talk to them.

07:51.450 --> 07:52.530
Yeah, yeah.

07:52.770 --> 07:56.290
- You don't remember saying that.
- I have this condition.

07:56.530 --> 07:58.650
- A condition?
- It's my memory.

07:58.890 --> 08:01.250
- Amnesia?
- No, no, it's different from that.

08:01.490 --> 08:05.370
I have no short-term memory.
I know all about myself, I just...

08:05.610 --> 08:09.130
Since my injury I can't make new memories. 
Everything fades.

08:09.370 --> 08:12.610
If we talk for too long
I'll forget how we started...

08:12.850 --> 08:15.250
and next time I see you
I won't remember this conversation.

08:15.490 --> 08:17.890
I don't even know if I've met you before.

08:18.130 --> 08:22.570
So if I seem a little strange or rude, 
or something, uh...

08:22.810 --> 08:25.090
I've told you this before, haven't I?

08:25.330 --> 08:29.090
I don't mean to mess with you
but it's so weird.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.290
- You don't remember me at all?
- No.

08:31.530 --> 08:35.049
- We've talked a bunch of times.
- I'm sure we have.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.210
What's the last thing you remember?

08:37.450 --> 08:39.490
My wife.

08:39.730 --> 08:43.210
What's it like?

08:45.610 --> 08:47.610
It's like waking.

08:47.850 --> 08:50.330
It's like you just woke up.

08:50.570 --> 08:52.370
That must suck.

08:52.610 --> 08:54.010
It's all backwards.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.890
Like, maybe you got an idea
about what you want to do next...

08:57.130 --> 08:59.090
but you don't remember what you just did.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.650
I mean, I'm exactly the opposite...

09:01.890 --> 09:04.690
- How long have I been staying here?
- Couple of days.

09:04.930 --> 09:07.130
- And you're holding my calls?
- Like you said.

09:07.370 --> 09:09.530
OK, but this guy's an exception.

09:09.770 --> 09:12.250
You know this guy?

09:12.490 --> 09:16.010
- Yeah, it's your friend, right?
- What makes you think that?

09:16.250 --> 09:18.330
- I saw you together, that's all.
- He's not my friend.

09:18.570 --> 09:19.770
OK.

09:20.010 --> 09:23.410
If he calls or shows up here,
give me a call in my room, OK?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.450
- What, his name's Teddy?
- Teddy, yeah.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.570
All right.

09:27.810 --> 09:30.450
Look, I hope my condition's
not gonna be a problem for you.

09:30.690 --> 09:33.330
Not as long as you remember to pay the bill.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.370
Yeah. OK.

09:35.610 --> 09:38.410
Forty.

09:38.650 --> 09:41.530
This guy.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.490
He's here already.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.490
Lenny!

09:47.730 --> 09:51.530
<i>You really need a system</i>
<i>if you're gonna make it work.</i>

09:51.770 --> 09:55.970
<i>You kinda learn to trust your handwriting.</i>
<i>It becomes an important part of your life.</i>

09:56.210 --> 09:59.850
<i>You write yourself notes.</i>
<i>Where you put them is really important.</i>

10:00.090 --> 10:02.530
<i>You need a jacket that's got,</i>
<i>like, six pockets...</i>

10:02.770 --> 10:04.610
<i>particular pockets for particular things.</i>

10:04.850 --> 10:08.890
<i>You just kinda learn to know where things go</i>
<i>and how the system works.</i>

10:09.130 --> 10:11.250
<i>You have to be wary of other people</i>
<i>writing stuff for you...</i>

10:11.490 --> 10:14.290
<i>that is not going to make sense</i>
<i>or is gonna lead you astray.</i>

10:14.530 --> 10:16.490
<i>I don't know what makes people take advantage...</i>

10:16.730 --> 10:18.530
<i>of somebody with this condition.</i>

10:18.770 --> 10:22.850
<i>If you have a piece of information</i>
<i>which... is...</i>

10:23.090 --> 10:26.810
<i>vital, writing on your body</i>
<i>instead of on a piece of paper can be the answer.</i>

10:27.050 --> 10:28.930
<i>It's a permanent way of keeping a note.</i>

10:35.930 --> 10:39.370
Who is this?

10:44.930 --> 10:49.290
<i>Remember Sammy Jankis.</i>

11:16.010 --> 11:19.010
- Sir, you left these at your table.
- Thanks.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.090
Ah, Lincoln Street?

11:21.330 --> 11:22.930
Just go straight out on Sixth Street...

11:23.170 --> 11:25.090
- go east through town...
- I'm gonna write this down.

11:25.330 --> 11:30.010
- Oh, it's easy. Go straight out...
- Trust me, I need to write this down.

11:35.130 --> 11:38.610
<i>The Discount Inn.</i>

11:59.890 --> 12:02.370
<i>Discount Inn.</i>

12:02.610 --> 12:06.090
<i>Natalie.</i>

12:06.090 --> 12:09.330
<i>My car.</i>

12:09.450 --> 12:12.930
<i>Teddy.</i>

12:23.730 --> 12:27.210
<i>John Edward Gammell.</i>

12:27.490 --> 12:30.730
This guy told me his name was Teddy.

12:33.930 --> 12:37.330
<i>Don't believe his lies.</i>

12:50.490 --> 12:52.290
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Mr Gammell?

12:52.530 --> 12:54.330
<i>- Lenny, is that you?</i>
- John Gammell?

12:54.570 --> 12:56.730
<i>Lenny, it's Teddy.</i>
<i>Stay there. I'll be right over.</i>

12:56.970 --> 13:01.450
- OK. I'll be waiting.

13:55.970 --> 13:58.730
White male.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.890
First name, John.

14:01.130 --> 14:06.330
Last name G for Gammell.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.410
Drugs.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.210
License plate.

14:13.450 --> 14:17.130
SG13...

14:17.930 --> 14:20.890
7IU.

14:23.890 --> 14:27.370
It's him.

14:31.130 --> 14:35.170
I've found you, you fuck.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.650
You said we talked before.
I don't remember that.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.690
Yeah, but it's not amnesia.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.090
I remember up until my injury,
I just can't make new memories.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.330
So I can't remember talking to you.
What did we talk about?

15:41.570 --> 15:43.370
Oh, Sammy Jankis.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.010
I guess I tell people about Sammy
to help them understand.

15:46.250 --> 15:49.210
Sammy's story helps me understand
my own situation.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.850
Sammy wrote himself endless amounts of notes.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.330
But he got mixed up.

15:54.570 --> 15:59.730
I have a more graceful solution
to the memory problem.

15:59.770 --> 16:01.570
I'm disciplined and organised.

16:01.810 --> 16:04.330
I use habit and routine
to make my life possible.

16:04.570 --> 16:06.690
Sammy had no drive...

16:06.930 --> 16:09.170
no reason to make it work.

16:09.410 --> 16:10.530
Me?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.610
Yeah...

16:12.850 --> 16:17.290
I got a reason.

16:31.370 --> 16:35.210
<i>Today, 1 p.m., meet Natalie for info.</i>

16:35.450 --> 16:41.010
<i>She has also lost someone.</i>
<i>She will help you out of pity.</i>

16:55.890 --> 16:58.090
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

16:58.330 --> 17:01.370
- I should've explained. I have this cond...
- You did explain, Lenny.

17:01.610 --> 17:04.329
Please call me Leonard.
My wife called me Lenny.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.849
- I know, you told me.
- Then I probably told you I hated it.

17:08.089 --> 17:09.770
Yeah.

17:10.010 --> 17:14.329
Do you mind taking your glasses off?
It's hard for me to...

17:14.329 --> 17:14.930
Thanks.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.490
So, you have information for me?

17:17.730 --> 17:20.210
- Is that what your little note says?
- Yeah.

17:20.450 --> 17:23.609
Must be tough living your life
according to a couple of scraps of paper.

17:23.849 --> 17:28.410
Mix your laundry list with your grocery list
and you'll end up eating your underwear.

17:28.650 --> 17:31.010
I guess that's why you have those freaky tattoos.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.250
Yeah, it's tough. It's almost impossible.

17:34.490 --> 17:39.370
Look, I'm sorry I don't remember you.
It's nothing personal.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.410
I do have information for you.

17:43.650 --> 17:46.330
You gave me a license-plate number.

17:46.570 --> 17:49.170
Had my friend at DMV trace it.

17:49.410 --> 17:52.090
Guess what name came up?

17:52.330 --> 17:55.290
John Edward Gammell. John G.

17:55.530 --> 17:56.610
Do you know him?

17:56.850 --> 18:00.290
No. But his face on his driver's licence
looked really familiar.

18:00.530 --> 18:02.930
I think he's been in the bar, maybe.

18:03.170 --> 18:06.330
Here's a copy of his licence, his registration, 
photo and all.

18:06.570 --> 18:08.370
Are you sure you want this?

18:08.610 --> 18:11.050
- Have I told you what this man did?
- Yeah.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.370
Well, then you shouldn't have to ask.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.610
Even if you get revenge,
you're not gonna remember it.

18:15.850 --> 18:17.650
You're not even gonna know it happened.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.930
My wife deserves vengeance. 
It doesn't make any difference if I know about it.

18:21.170 --> 18:23.250
Just because there are things I don't remember...

18:23.490 --> 18:25.570
doesn't make my actions meaningless.

18:25.810 --> 18:29.090
The world doesn't just disappear
when you close your eyes.

18:29.330 --> 18:32.650
Anyway, maybe I'll take a photograph
to remind myself.

18:32.890 --> 18:36.370
Get another freaky tattoo.

18:38.930 --> 18:41.850
Tell me about her again.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.290
Why?

18:43.530 --> 18:47.690
Because you like to remember her.

18:47.970 --> 18:51.170
She was beautiful.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.410
- To me she was perfect.
- No.

18:53.650 --> 18:57.130
Don't just recite the words.

18:57.370 --> 19:02.250
Close your eyes and remember her.

19:10.930 --> 19:14.410
You can just feel the details.

19:15.530 --> 19:20.210
The bits and pieces
you never bothered to put into words.

19:23.050 --> 19:25.850
And you can feel these extreme moments.

19:26.090 --> 19:29.330
<i>Even if you don't want to.</i>

19:30.370 --> 19:34.770
<i>You put these together</i>
<i>and you get the feel of a person.</i>

19:35.650 --> 19:39.050
Enough to know how much you miss them.

19:43.450 --> 19:48.930
<i>And how much you hate the person</i>
<i>who took them away.</i>

19:56.090 --> 19:59.010
I, um, I added an address in here.

19:59.250 --> 20:02.410
It might be useful.
It's an abandoned place outside of town.

20:02.650 --> 20:06.970
Um, I guy I knew
used to do bigger deals there.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.250
It's isolated.

20:09.490 --> 20:12.970
Sounds perfect.

20:13.970 --> 20:16.890
- Do I owe you any...
- I wasn't helping you for money.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.090
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

20:19.330 --> 20:22.850
See, you have this condition.

20:23.290 --> 20:28.610
You still staying at the Discount Inn?
Room 304? Left it at my place.

20:32.050 --> 20:35.330
Yeah.

20:35.650 --> 20:39.810
- They treating you OK?
- I don't remember.

20:41.050 --> 20:44.530
You know what we have in common?

20:44.930 --> 20:48.730
We are both survivors.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.970
You take care, Leonard.

21:18.930 --> 21:21.850
<i>Remember Sammy Jankis.</i>

21:22.090 --> 21:25.890
I met Sammy through work. Insurance.
I was an investigator.

21:26.130 --> 21:28.370
I'd investigate the claims
to see which ones were phoney.

21:28.610 --> 21:30.410
I had to see through people's bullshit.

21:30.650 --> 21:33.090
It was useful experience cos now it's my life.

21:33.330 --> 21:36.330
When I meet someone,
I don't know if I've met them before.

21:36.570 --> 21:38.770
I have to look in their eyes
and try and figure them out.

21:39.010 --> 21:42.010
<i>My job taught me the best way to find out</i>
<i>what someone knew was let them talk.</i>

21:42.250 --> 21:43.890
<i>Watch the eyes and the body language.</i>

21:44.130 --> 21:48.010
<i>If someone scratches their nose,</i>
<i>experts tell you it means they're lying.</i>

21:48.250 --> 21:51.330
<i>It really means they're nervous.</i>
<i>People get nervous for all sorts of reasons.</i>

21:51.570 --> 21:52.570
<i>It's all about context.</i>

21:52.810 --> 21:54.610
Yeah, I was good.

21:54.850 --> 21:59.410
Sammy was my first real challenge.

22:03.970 --> 22:06.930
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

22:07.170 --> 22:09.330
- Well, things change.
- So I see.

22:09.570 --> 22:12.370
- My name's Teddy.
- I guess I've told you about my condition.

22:12.610 --> 22:17.970
Only every time I see ya.
Come on, I'll buy you lunch.

22:21.850 --> 22:23.850
- Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
- Mmm. Yeah.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.890
I'm sick of hearing about the guy.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.090
What about John G?
You think he's still here?

22:28.330 --> 22:30.650
- Who?
- Johnny G, the guy you're looking for.

22:30.890 --> 22:33.090
- That's why you haven't left town, right?
- Maybe.

22:33.330 --> 22:36.330
- Leonard, you have to be very careful.
- Why?

22:36.570 --> 22:39.370
You mentioned that maybe somebody
was trying to set you up.

22:39.610 --> 22:40.970
Get you to kill the wrong guy.

22:41.210 --> 22:44.490
I go on facts, not recommendations,
but thank you.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.490
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life
to your little notes and pictures.

22:47.730 --> 22:50.250
- Why not?
- Because your notes could be unreliable.

22:50.490 --> 22:51.970
- Memory's unreliable.
- Oh, please.

22:52.210 --> 22:55.570
No, really. Memory's not perfect,
it's not even that good. Ask the police.

22:55.810 --> 22:57.970
Eyewitness testimony is unreliable.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.450
The cops don't catch a killer
by sitting around remembering stuff.

23:00.690 --> 23:03.410
- They collect facts and draw conclusions.
- That's not what I'm saying.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.570
Facts, not memories.

23:05.810 --> 23:07.890
That's how you investigate.
I know, it's what I used to do.

23:08.130 --> 23:11.970
Memory can change the shape of a room,
it can change the colour of a car.

23:12.210 --> 23:14.170
And memories can be distorted.

23:14.410 --> 23:16.210
They're an interpretation, not a record.

23:16.450 --> 23:18.290
They're irrelevant if you have the facts.

23:18.530 --> 23:21.250
You really want to get this guy, don't you?

23:21.490 --> 23:26.410
He killed my wife.
He took away my fucking memory.

23:26.730 --> 23:30.730
He destroyed my ability to live.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.050
You're living.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.130
Only for revenge.

23:36.370 --> 23:38.170
Well, then we'll get the bastard.

23:38.410 --> 23:42.010
Where are you staying?

23:43.010 --> 23:47.050
The Discount Inn. I don't know what room.
I haven't got my key.

23:47.290 --> 23:50.930
Probably left it in your room.

24:02.890 --> 24:03.850
Hi.

24:04.090 --> 24:06.090
I'm checked in here
but I think I've misplaced my key.

24:06.330 --> 24:11.930
How you doing, Leonard?
Probably in the room, right?

24:28.330 --> 24:30.610
- I don't see my key anywhere.
- Oh, shit. This is the wrong room.

24:30.850 --> 24:32.490
You're in 304. I'm sorry. I fucked up.

24:32.730 --> 24:35.250
- This is not my room?
- No. Come on, let's go.

24:35.490 --> 24:38.810
Then why is this my handwriting?

24:40.970 --> 24:44.930
Well... this was your room
but now you're in 304.

24:45.170 --> 24:47.170
- When was I in here?
- Last week.

24:47.410 --> 24:50.530
- Then I rented you another room on top.
- Why?

24:50.770 --> 24:55.050
Business is slow, I mean, 
I told my boss about your condition and stuff...

24:55.290 --> 24:56.770
he said rent him another room.

24:57.010 --> 24:59.010
So how many rooms am I checked into
in this shit hole?

24:59.250 --> 25:01.450
Just two. So far.

25:01.690 --> 25:02.250
Well...

25:02.490 --> 25:04.850
at least you're being honest
about ripping me off.

25:05.090 --> 25:09.330
- You're not going to remember anyway.
- You don't have to be that honest, Burt.

25:09.570 --> 25:12.730
Leonard. Always get a receipt.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.730
Oh, yeah. I'll write that down.

25:17.170 --> 25:20.490
- Hey, what time is it?
- Quarter to one.

25:20.730 --> 25:22.330
Excuse me.

25:22.570 --> 25:25.650
Your room's...

25:36.410 --> 25:38.450
- Natalie.
- You don't remember me.

25:38.690 --> 25:41.330
I'd just become an investigator
when I came across Sammy.

25:41.570 --> 25:44.970
Mr Samuel R Jankis, strangest case ever.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.090
The guy's a 58-year-old,
semiretired accountant.

25:48.330 --> 25:50.370
He and his wife were in this car accident,
nothing serious.

25:50.610 --> 25:54.850
<i>But he's acting funny,</i>
<i>he can't get a handle on what's going on.</i>

25:55.090 --> 25:58.450
<i>The doctors find some possible damage to the hippocampus,</i>
<i>nothing conclusive.</i>

25:58.690 --> 26:02.050
<i>Sammy can't remember anything</i>
<i>for more than a couple of minutes.</i>

26:02.290 --> 26:03.490
<i>Can't work, can't do shit.</i>

26:03.730 --> 26:07.730
<i>The medical bills pile up,</i>
<i>his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in.</i>

26:07.970 --> 26:12.770
<i>This is my first big claims investigation</i>
<i>so I really check into it.</i>

26:13.010 --> 26:16.410
<i>Sammy can think just fine</i>
<i>but he can't make new memories.</i>

26:16.650 --> 26:20.610
<i>He can only remember things</i>
<i>for a couple of minutes.</i>

26:20.690 --> 26:23.650
<i>He'd watch TV but anything longer</i>
<i>than a couple of minutes was too confusing...</i>

26:23.890 --> 26:25.730
<i>he couldn't remember how it began.</i>

26:25.970 --> 26:28.050
<i>He liked commercials. They were short.</i>

26:28.290 --> 26:29.970
Sammy. It's time for my shot.

26:30.210 --> 26:32.970
<i>The crazy part was that this guy...</i>

26:33.210 --> 26:35.490
<i>who couldn't follow the plot</i>
<i>of Green Acres anymore...</i>

26:35.730 --> 26:37.570
<i>could do the most complicated things...</i>

26:37.810 --> 26:41.490
<i>as long as he learned them</i>
<i>before the accident...</i>

26:42.330 --> 26:45.170
<i>and as long as he kept his mind</i>
<i>on what he was doing.</i>

26:45.410 --> 26:48.090
<i>The doctors assure me...</i>

26:48.330 --> 26:52.250
<i>there's a real condition, anterial-grade memory loss,</i>
<i>or short-term memory loss.</i>

26:52.490 --> 26:55.530
<i>It's rare but legit.</i>

26:55.770 --> 26:58.410
<i>But every time I see him...</i>

26:58.650 --> 27:00.970
<i>I catch this look...</i>

27:01.210 --> 27:04.330
<i>this... slight look of recognition.</i>

27:04.570 --> 27:07.090
<i>But he says he can't remember me at all.</i>

27:07.330 --> 27:09.250
Sammy, it's OK. I got it.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.970
- Hi, Mr Shelby.
- Hi, Mrs Jankis.

27:12.210 --> 27:16.210
<i>Now, I can read people</i>
<i>and I'm thinking "bad actor".</i>

27:16.450 --> 27:20.730
So now I'm suspicious and I order more tests.

27:22.330 --> 27:25.290
<i>Awake.</i>

27:25.530 --> 27:29.650
<i>Oh, where am I?</i>

27:30.370 --> 27:34.090
<i>Somebody's bedroom.</i>

27:34.290 --> 27:37.210
<i>Oh, it must be her room.</i>

27:37.450 --> 27:40.930
<i>But who is she?</i>

27:47.010 --> 27:50.370
It's only me.

27:50.890 --> 27:55.410
- Did you sleep OK?
- Yeah. You?

27:55.410 --> 27:57.210
Oh, shit. Shit.

27:57.450 --> 28:00.650
I gotta be someplace.

28:02.850 --> 28:05.010
It's pretty weird.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.690
It's useful. 
You never write a phone number on your hand?

28:08.930 --> 28:12.890
I, um, I should be able to talk to my friend today...

28:13.130 --> 28:15.930
- about the license plate.
- Yeah, the license plate.

28:16.170 --> 28:20.050
John G's license plate.

28:21.250 --> 28:24.730
You have it tattooed on your thigh.

28:40.770 --> 28:44.250
<i>Natalie.</i>

28:44.810 --> 28:50.090
<i>She has also lost someone.</i>
<i>She will help you out of pity.</i>

28:53.610 --> 28:55.330
If it's registered in this state...

28:55.570 --> 28:57.610
it should only take a couple seconds
to pull up his licence and registration.

28:57.850 --> 29:00.050
I'll call you as soon as I talk to him.

29:00.290 --> 29:04.650
Could we arrange a meeting now?
I'm not too good on the phone.

29:12.090 --> 29:14.210
You know, it's great that you...

29:14.450 --> 29:16.250
Well, that you're...

29:16.490 --> 29:18.050
helping me...

29:18.290 --> 29:19.490
like this.

29:19.730 --> 29:24.450
I'm helping you because you helped me.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.770
So next time you see me...

29:37.010 --> 29:39.930
will you remember me?

29:54.730 --> 29:57.770
I think you will.

29:58.010 --> 30:01.490
I'm sorry.

30:02.170 --> 30:07.170
Lenny, before you go,
could I have my shirt back, please?

30:21.330 --> 30:24.170
Yo, Lenny! I thought you'd split for good.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.930
Sammy couldn't pick up any new skills at all.

30:27.170 --> 30:29.330
But I find something in my research.

30:29.570 --> 30:30.930
Conditioning.

30:31.170 --> 30:33.850
Sammy should still be able to learn
through repetition.

30:34.090 --> 30:37.130
It's how you learn stuff like riding a bike.
You get better through practice.

30:37.370 --> 30:39.370
It's a different part of the brain
from the short-term memory.

30:39.610 --> 30:42.890
So I had the doctors test 
Sammy's response to conditioning.

30:43.130 --> 30:46.930
- Pick up any three objects.
- That's a test?

30:47.170 --> 30:49.290
Where were you guys when I did my CPA?

30:49.530 --> 30:52.410
Sorry.

30:52.970 --> 30:54.770
Ta-da!

30:55.010 --> 30:57.010
- Ow! What the fuck?

30:57.250 --> 31:01.090
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack.

31:02.210 --> 31:04.930
<i>Some of the objects were electrified.</i>
<i>They'd give him a shock.</i>

31:05.170 --> 31:08.010
They kept repeating the test,
always with the same objects electrified.

31:08.250 --> 31:11.410
The point was to see if Sammy 
could learn to avoid the electrified objects...

31:11.650 --> 31:15.530
not by memory, but by instinct.

31:33.690 --> 31:37.770
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

31:38.610 --> 31:41.050
Guess I don't have to worry about him any more.

31:41.290 --> 31:44.690
- What the fuck have you got me into?
- Shh. Come inside.

31:47.290 --> 31:49.970
- Who is he?
- Calm down. OK?

31:50.210 --> 31:53.410
This is my problem. You offered to help.
It's nothing to do with your investigation.

31:53.650 --> 31:54.930
How did you get me into this?

31:55.170 --> 31:56.970
You offered to help me
when you saw what he did to my face.

31:57.210 --> 32:00.450
- How do I know he did that to your face?
- I came straight to you after he did it.

32:00.690 --> 32:02.730
I showed you what he did
and I asked you to help me.

32:02.970 --> 32:05.890
- Oh, and I just take your word?
- Yeah.

32:06.130 --> 32:08.130
Something doesn't feel right.

32:08.370 --> 32:10.530
I think someone's fucking with me,
trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.

32:10.770 --> 32:11.890
- Did you?
- What?

32:12.130 --> 32:13.810
Kill him?

32:14.050 --> 32:17.770
- Course not!
- Hey. Sit down, OK? Sit.

32:18.010 --> 32:23.170
This has nothing to do with you.
You helped me out and I'm grateful.

32:23.410 --> 32:26.610
You have to burn them.

32:28.490 --> 32:32.170
Leonard, you decided to help me.
Trust your own judgement.

32:32.410 --> 32:35.570
You can question everything,
you can never know anything for sure.

32:35.810 --> 32:39.090
- There are things you know for sure.
- Such as?

32:39.330 --> 32:42.730
I know what that's gonna sound like
when I knock on it.

32:42.970 --> 32:46.090
I know what that's gonna feel like
when I pick it up. See?

32:46.330 --> 32:50.250
Certainties. 
It's the kind of memory you take for granted.

32:50.490 --> 32:54.170
You know, I can remember so much.

32:54.410 --> 32:56.610
The feel of the world...

32:56.850 --> 33:00.330
And her.

33:04.370 --> 33:06.170
She's gone.

33:06.410 --> 33:10.010
And the present is trivia
which I scribble down as fucking notes.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.650
Hey, come on. Try and relax. Come on.

33:12.890 --> 33:15.850
- It's not easy for me to relax.
- Shh. Shhh.

33:16.090 --> 33:18.090
Come on, take your jacket off.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.690
Here. Come on.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.770
Hey.

33:24.010 --> 33:27.490
Didn't think you were the type.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.610
It's backwards.

33:37.850 --> 33:41.930
Come here. Come here.

34:01.130 --> 34:04.330
What about here?

34:04.570 --> 34:08.449
Maybe it's... for when I find him.

34:09.370 --> 34:13.010
I've lost somebody too.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.050
I'm sorry.

34:15.290 --> 34:16.969
His name was Jimmy.

34:17.210 --> 34:20.050
- What happened to him?
- He went to meet somebody.

34:20.290 --> 34:23.170
He never came back.

34:23.409 --> 34:26.969
- Who did he go to meet?
- A guy called Teddy.

34:27.210 --> 34:29.170
What do the police think?

34:29.409 --> 34:33.409
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.

34:33.650 --> 34:36.050
When you find this guy, this...

34:36.290 --> 34:40.929
John G, what are you gonna do?

34:41.730 --> 34:45.210
I'm gonna kill him.

34:45.370 --> 34:49.610
Maybe I can help you find him.

34:52.050 --> 34:57.170
I don't even know how long she's been gone.

34:58.610 --> 35:03.690
It's like I've woken up in bed
and she's not here...

35:03.810 --> 35:09.330
because she's gone to the bathroom
or something.

35:10.930 --> 35:13.770
But somehow I just...

35:14.010 --> 35:19.690
I just know she's never gonna come back to bed.

35:21.970 --> 35:24.050
If I could just...

35:24.290 --> 35:28.930
reach over and touch her side of the bed...

35:29.170 --> 35:33.370
I would know that it was cold.

35:34.010 --> 35:37.690
But I can't.

35:39.690 --> 35:43.170
I know I can't have her back.

35:43.490 --> 35:48.370
But I don't want to wake up in the morning
thinking she's still here.

35:48.610 --> 35:54.490
I lie here not knowing how long I've been alone.

35:58.570 --> 36:00.890
So how...

36:01.130 --> 36:04.690
How can I heal?

36:05.530 --> 36:09.090
How am I supposed to heal if I can't...

36:09.330 --> 36:12.890
feel time?

37:20.490 --> 37:26.570
<i>She has also lost someone.</i>
<i>She will help you out of pity.</i>

37:49.090 --> 37:51.650
They kept testing Sammy for months.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.610
<i>Always with the same objects</i>
<i>carrying the electrical charge.</i>

37:54.850 --> 37:56.650
- Ow! What the fuck?

37:56.890 --> 37:59.050
- It's a test, Sammy.
- Test this, you fucking quack!

37:59.290 --> 38:01.130
Even with total short-term memory loss...

38:01.370 --> 38:04.450
Sammy should have learned instinctively
to stop picking up the wrong objects.

38:04.690 --> 38:08.410
<i>Other cases responded to conditioning,</i>
<i>Sammy didn't respond at all.</i>

38:08.650 --> 38:11.930
<i>It suggested that his condition</i>
<i>was psychological not physical.</i>

38:12.170 --> 38:16.370
We turned down his claim on the grounds
that he wasn't covered for mental illness.

38:16.610 --> 38:20.410
His wife got stuck with the bills
and I got a big promotion.

38:20.650 --> 38:24.250
Conditioning didn't work for Sammy,
so he became helpless.

38:24.490 --> 38:26.290
But it works for me.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.370
I live the way Sammy couldn't.

38:28.610 --> 38:31.170
Habit and routine make my life possible.

38:31.410 --> 38:35.610
Conditioning. Acting on instinct.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.370
<i>Awake.</i>

38:44.610 --> 38:47.770
<i>Where am I?</i>

38:48.010 --> 38:50.170
<i>Motel room.</i>

38:50.410 --> 38:53.890
Oh.

38:55.890 --> 39:00.130
<i>Some anonymous motel room.</i>

39:01.970 --> 39:05.210
<i>Nothing in the drawers.</i>
<i>But I'll take a look anyway.</i>

39:05.450 --> 39:07.250
<i>Nothing except the Gideon Bi...</i>

39:07.490 --> 39:10.810
<i>Bible.</i>

39:21.770 --> 39:25.090
- Hey! Open up!

39:25.330 --> 39:27.130
- Just a minute!

39:27.370 --> 39:29.730
Open the door!

39:29.970 --> 39:33.170
- Lenny?

39:33.410 --> 39:37.890
Open the door!

39:40.370 --> 39:43.850
Come on!

39:44.010 --> 39:47.570
- Hi, Teddy.
- Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?

39:47.810 --> 39:52.210
Oh!

39:58.410 --> 40:01.450
- Oh, I get it.

40:01.690 --> 40:03.930
- Amorous neighbours.
- What are you doing here?

40:04.170 --> 40:07.570
You called me.
You said you needed my help.

40:07.810 --> 40:10.970
You know, 
I've had more rewarding friendships than this one.

40:11.210 --> 40:14.330
Although I do get to keep telling the same jokes.

40:14.570 --> 40:17.730
What the fuck is that?

40:22.410 --> 40:23.690
Who the fuck is that?

40:23.930 --> 40:25.850
- You don't know him?
- No! Should I?

40:26.090 --> 40:29.890
- Wait a minute. Is that John G?
- I don't think so.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.930
You don't think so?
You didn't write it down?

40:32.170 --> 40:36.170
- I might have fallen asleep before I did.
- For Christ sakes!

40:36.410 --> 40:39.890
Ask him.

40:41.850 --> 40:44.570
What's your name? Your name?

40:44.810 --> 40:46.610
- Dodd.
- And who did this to you?

40:46.850 --> 40:49.210
- What?
- Who did this to you?

40:49.450 --> 40:52.930
You did.

40:53.330 --> 40:58.610
- I'm not going to help you kill that guy.
- No, no. Just let me think for a minute.

41:02.610 --> 41:05.330
OK, Natalie. Who's Natalie? Natalie who?

41:05.570 --> 41:07.570
- Why?
- Maybe I know her.

41:07.810 --> 41:10.130
Look, we gotta get him out of here.

41:10.370 --> 41:12.970
All right, all right, all right.

41:13.210 --> 41:15.050
He's got to have a car, right?

41:15.290 --> 41:18.290
We take him to his car, tell him to get 
the fuck out of town or we're gonna kill him.

41:18.530 --> 41:20.330
We can't walk him out of here
tied up and bleeding.

41:20.570 --> 41:22.730
- How the fuck did you get him up here?
- I don't know!

41:22.970 --> 41:26.330
- You don't know.

41:26.570 --> 41:30.210
Yes, I do. This is not my room.
It must be his room. Great. Let's go.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.250
- No, no, no. We can't just leave him here.
- Why not?

41:32.490 --> 41:38.330
Because the maid's gonna walk in.
She'll see him, call the cops. He can ID us.

41:38.570 --> 41:41.170
OK. We untie him, we clean him up...

41:41.410 --> 41:43.250
and we march him out of here
with a gun in his back.

41:43.490 --> 41:46.410
A gun. Why would I have a gun?

41:46.650 --> 41:50.690
It must be his. I don't think
they'd let someone like me carry a gun.

41:50.930 --> 41:54.210
Fucking hope not.

41:59.770 --> 42:03.250
Which one?

42:04.210 --> 42:06.570
We should probably steal his car.
You know, teach him a lesson.

42:06.810 --> 42:09.490
- Shut up.
- It's all right for you, you've got the Jag.

42:09.730 --> 42:12.530
All right, get in.
I'm gonna ride with him, you follow us.

42:12.770 --> 42:14.570
Give me your keys.

42:14.810 --> 42:18.290
Take your own car.

42:42.730 --> 42:44.530
So was he scared?

42:44.770 --> 42:46.450
I think it was your sinister moustache.

42:46.690 --> 42:49.250
Fuck you. Should have stolen his car.

42:49.490 --> 42:54.810
- Why? What's wrong with this one?
- Nothing. You want to trade?

42:55.490 --> 42:57.330
So what do you do now?

42:57.570 --> 43:02.170
I'm gonna find out
what the fuck that was all about.

43:07.050 --> 43:11.050
Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?

43:11.570 --> 43:14.810
Sammy's wife was crippled
by the cost of supporting him.

43:15.050 --> 43:18.250
And fighting the company's decision.

43:18.490 --> 43:20.890
But it wasn't the money that got to her.

43:21.130 --> 43:23.330
<i>I never said that Sammy was faking.</i>

43:23.570 --> 43:25.370
Sammy, I have an idea.

43:25.610 --> 43:28.650
<i>Just that his problem was mental,</i>
<i>not physical.</i>

43:28.890 --> 43:31.330
You're gonna have a pen in your pocket.

43:31.570 --> 43:33.170
<i>She couldn't understand.</i>

43:33.410 --> 43:35.770
- I did something wrong?
- You did something wrong!

43:36.010 --> 43:39.050
We're gonna deal with it.
We're gonna try a little harder.

43:39.290 --> 43:42.010
<i>She looks into his eyes</i>
<i>and sees the same person...</i>

43:42.250 --> 43:44.610
<i>and if it's not a physical problem,</i>
<i>he should snap out of it.</i>

43:44.850 --> 43:45.650
- Ellen called!
- Ellen called.

43:45.890 --> 43:48.570
Ellen called.
Ellen... Ellen can't come today!

43:48.810 --> 43:51.130
- Ellen can't come!
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

43:51.370 --> 43:55.130
- I'm trying! I'm sorry!

43:56.610 --> 44:00.970
So, Leonard Shelby from the insurance company 
gives her the seed of doubt.

44:01.210 --> 44:03.570
Just like he gave it to the doctors.

44:03.810 --> 44:05.970
But I never said that he was faking.

44:06.210 --> 44:09.690
I never said that.

44:12.730 --> 44:16.850
<i>Hm. I don't feel drunk.</i>

45:24.730 --> 45:27.210
- Hello? Housekeeping.
- Oh, shit!

45:27.450 --> 45:31.810
- Not right now!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

45:57.250 --> 46:03.610
<i>Dodd. Put him onto Teddy</i>
<i>or just get rid of him for Natalie.</i>

46:06.810 --> 46:10.290
<i>Dodd.</i>

46:13.170 --> 46:17.970
<i>Get rid of him. Ask Natalie.</i>

46:18.090 --> 46:21.330
<i>Teddy, Teddy.</i>

46:30.050 --> 46:32.010
<i>Yeah, leave your number,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

46:32.250 --> 46:35.010
Yeah. This is a message for Teddy.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.170
I'm at the Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street,
room six.

46:37.410 --> 46:40.010
I need you to come over as soon as you get this. 
It's important.

46:40.250 --> 46:43.810
Oh, this is Leonard. 
Thanks. Bye.

46:44.530 --> 46:46.330
Phew!

46:46.570 --> 46:49.850
Fuck!

46:56.450 --> 47:00.250
Mrs Jankis didn't understand 
that you can't bully someone into remembering.

47:00.490 --> 47:03.770
The more pressure you're under,
the harder it gets.

47:04.010 --> 47:08.650
Ah. Well, then, call me back?

47:27.770 --> 47:31.250
<i>OK. So what am I doing?</i>

47:31.970 --> 47:35.050
<i>Oh, I'm chasing this guy.</i>

47:36.010 --> 47:40.330
<i>No. He's chasing me.</i>

47:59.330 --> 48:02.850
Ah! Fuck!

48:05.290 --> 48:10.130
<i>Dodd, white guy,</i>
<i>Mount Crest Inn on Fifth Street.</i>

48:10.370 --> 48:13.690
<i>I'll get the jump on you, you fucker.</i>

48:48.170 --> 48:51.010
Oh, fuck!

48:51.250 --> 48:54.730
Sorry.

49:25.290 --> 49:28.770
<i>I need a weapon.</i>

49:30.410 --> 49:33.050
<i>This'll do.</i>

49:54.290 --> 49:58.130
<i>Hm. I don't feel drunk.</i>

50:36.450 --> 50:38.970
<i>Do I know this guy?</i>

50:39.210 --> 50:42.890
<i>He seems to know me.</i>

50:46.010 --> 50:49.490
What the fuck?

51:00.130 --> 51:02.330
- I like your car.
- Thank you.

51:02.570 --> 51:04.330
- Where'd you get it?
- Are you interested in buying one?

51:04.570 --> 51:06.770
What, I haven't made a strong enough impression on you?

51:07.010 --> 51:11.090
I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

51:19.210 --> 51:22.930
<i>OK. So what am I doing?</i>

51:30.930 --> 51:35.010
Who is this?

52:48.330 --> 52:52.650
Ouch! Cut it out.

53:20.650 --> 53:23.530
- How can you read that again?
- It's good.

53:23.770 --> 53:28.130
- You've read it, like, a thousand times.
- I enjoy it.

53:28.370 --> 53:31.970
I thought the pleasure of a book 
was in wanting to know what happens next.

53:32.210 --> 53:37.130
Don't be a prick.
I'm not reading it to annoy you. I enjoy it.

53:37.490 --> 53:41.530
Just let me read. Please?

53:50.330 --> 53:54.090
<i>Probably tried this before.</i>

53:54.690 --> 53:59.290
<i>Probably burned truckloads of your stuff.</i>

53:59.690 --> 54:03.770
<i>Can't remember to forget you.</i>

54:18.930 --> 54:20.130
Yeah.

54:20.370 --> 54:22.250
Uh-huh.

54:22.490 --> 54:27.330
Well, sir, that'd certainly be in keeping
with some of my own discoveries.

54:27.570 --> 54:32.090
I was hoping for more on the drugs angle.
Will you hang on a sec?

54:39.290 --> 54:41.770
The police report mentioned the drugs 
found in the car outside my house.

54:42.010 --> 54:43.850
The car was stolen.
His prints were all over it.

54:44.090 --> 54:45.890
I got friends in the department.
They gave me a copy.

54:46.130 --> 54:47.850
I dealt with the police a lot in my insurance job.

54:48.090 --> 54:53.290
With my condition it's really tough.
I can't keep it all in mind at once.

54:53.530 --> 54:55.010
I have to summarise the sections.

54:55.250 --> 54:58.170
There are pages missing.
I guess I've been trying to log them all.

54:58.410 --> 55:00.410
I don't know why these are crossed out.

55:00.650 --> 55:02.490
They weren't even looking for John G.

55:02.730 --> 55:05.250
The stuff they found in the car fit in 
with what they believed had happened...

55:05.490 --> 55:08.370
so they didn't chase it up.

55:41.410 --> 55:44.290
Honey?

55:45.170 --> 55:48.650
Honey, it's late.

56:08.130 --> 56:10.170
Everything OK?

56:25.770 --> 56:29.690
<i>You OK in there?</i>

56:30.970 --> 56:33.250
Was it good for you?

56:35.530 --> 56:39.170
What? Was I supposed to lock the door?

56:39.410 --> 56:42.210
No.

56:42.450 --> 56:45.930
I'd like you to leave now.

57:04.050 --> 57:07.330
There's something about the drugs stashed in the car 
that doesn't ring true.

57:07.570 --> 57:11.450
The police claim the guy was an addict
needing money to score. It's bullshit.

57:11.690 --> 57:15.890
He's not gonna go breaking into places
while he's still got a stash that big.

57:16.130 --> 57:20.130
Well, I think John G left it there.
Or planted it there.

57:20.370 --> 57:23.850
How do you know that?

57:24.210 --> 57:26.010
Oh, shit, that's true. It fits.

57:26.250 --> 57:28.370
So he's a dealer.

57:28.610 --> 57:32.210
Hang on a sec.

57:40.050 --> 57:42.970
Now we're getting somewhere.

57:43.210 --> 57:45.410
<i>Discount Inn.</i>

58:34.850 --> 58:36.250
Yeah, OK.

58:36.490 --> 58:39.010
Blonde's fine.

58:39.250 --> 58:41.770
Well, that's what they say.

58:42.010 --> 58:45.010
The Discount Inn. 304.

58:45.250 --> 58:47.330
Leonard.

58:47.570 --> 58:48.770
Well, what then?

58:49.010 --> 58:51.810
We just go to bed.
You wait for me to fall asleep.

58:52.050 --> 58:54.010
You go into the bathroom and slam the door.

58:54.250 --> 58:56.530
- Slam it?
- Yeah. Loud enough to wake me up.

58:56.770 --> 58:58.890
- And that's it?
- That's it.

58:59.130 --> 59:01.090
Ah...

59:01.330 --> 59:05.730
Yeah, first I just need you
to put these things around the room.

59:06.850 --> 59:10.730
Pretend they're your things
and this is your bedroom.

59:21.490 --> 59:27.650
- Should I wear it?
- No, no, no. Uh, just like you took it off.

59:29.610 --> 59:32.850
I don't want you to use it. I'm sorry.

59:32.970 --> 59:39.770
I just mean put them around the room,
as if they were your... your things.

59:41.770 --> 59:45.250
Whatever gets you off.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.810
I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:12.690
This is a difficult condition to understand.
Look at Sammy Jankis.

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.770
His own wife couldn't deal with it.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.450
I told you how she tried to get him
to snap out of it.

01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.770
She came to see me at the office.
I found out all kinds of shit.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:23.210
<i>She told me about life with Sammy.</i>
<i>How she treated him.</i>

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.690
Thank you for seeing me.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.330
She'd get Sammy to hide food around the house...

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.090
then she'd stop feeding him 
to see if his hunger would make him remember.

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:33.330
I've taken him to a parking lot and, uh...

01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:36.850
<i>She wasn't a cruel person.</i>
<i>She just wanted her old Sammy back.</i>

01:00:37.090 --> 01:00:39.610
You know all about Sammy
and you've decided he's faking.

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.330
The company's position
isn't that Sammy's faking anything...

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:44.610
just that his condition can't be shown to be...

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:47.170
I just want to know
your honest opinion about Sammy.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.410
We shouldn't be talking like this
while the case is still open to appeal.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:53.650
- I'm not appealing the decision.
- Then why are you here?

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:59.410
Try to understand, when I look at Sammy,
I don't see some... vegetable.

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:02.610
I see my same old Sammy.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.650
What do you think that's like for me...

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:07.770
to suspect that he might be imagining
this whole problem?

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:09.850
That if I just could say the right thing...

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:14.210
he'd snap out of it
and go back to being normal.

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:17.410
If I...

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:20.690
If I knew that my old Sammy were truly gone...

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:27.250
then I could say goodbye
and start loving this new Sammy.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.330
As long as I have doubt
I can't say goodbye and move on.

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:32.370
What do you want from me?

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:35.410
I want you to forget the company you work for thirty seconds...

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:39.970
and tell me if you really believe
that Sammy's faking his condition.

01:01:40.210 --> 01:01:42.090
I need to know...

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.210
what you honestly believe.

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:54.090
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable 
of making new memories.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.450
Thank you.

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.490
<i>I thought I'd helped her.</i>

01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:08.930
I thought she just needed an answer.
I didn't think it was important what it was.

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:13.250
Just that she had one to believe.

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.330
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.130
- Teddy, your buddy.
- Prove it!

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:35.650
Remember Sammy?
You told me about Sammy!

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:38.530
- Jeez!
- What the fuck are you doing in my car?

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:43.010
What, your sense of humour went with the memory? 
Do you know why you're here?

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.050
- Unfinished business.
- Lenny...

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.810
let me inform you,
your business here is very much finished.

01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:51.770
- You're still here because of Natalie.
- Who's Natalie?

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:57.290
Schmuck! 
Whose house do you think you just walked out of?

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:02.010
That's right, take a look at your pictures.
I bet you got one of her.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:05.490
Oh, nice shot, Leibovitz.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:08.130
You'll want to make a note.
You can't trust her.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:09.530
Why's that?

01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:12.810
Because by now she's taken a look 
at the suit and the car...

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:18.570
and she's figuring out ways
of turning the situation to her advantage.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.890
She's already got you staying with her, for Christ sakes. 
You can't go back there.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:23.810
Let me give you the name of a motel.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.410
You're lucky I ran into you.
That broad's bad news.

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:29.890
- What do you mean, "bad news"?
- She's involved with drugs.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.210
Look. See these?

01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:36.130
This is the bar where she works.
Her boyfriend's a drug dealer.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:38.850
She takes orders for him, arranges meets.

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.490
He writes messages on the back of these...

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:44.130
then she slips him the answers
when she serves him his drinks.

01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:48.050
- Why should I care?
- Because when she gets jammed up...

01:03:48.290 --> 01:03:50.090
she's gonna use you to protect herself.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:51.610
From who?

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.210
Guys are gonna wanna know
what happened to her boyfriend.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.490
Guys are gonna come after her.

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:59.290
Somebody's got to pay, Lenny.
Somebody always pays.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:00.730
Maybe she'll make it you.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.170
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe she'll make it you. Is that it?

01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.370
You worried that she's gonna use me against you?

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.410
- No.
- Why not?

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:11.770
Because she doesn't know who I am.

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:14.690
- Why are you following me?
- Maybe I wanna help.

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.730
She doesn't know anything about your investigation. 
OK, Einstein?

01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:21.290
So write this down.

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:25.770
When she offers to help,
it'll be for her own reasons.

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:30.410
I'm not lying.
Take my pen, write this down.

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:34.290
Do not trust her.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:41.410
There. You happy now?

01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.250
- I won't be happy until you leave town.
- Why not?

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.210
You ever wonder
how long you can hang around here...

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:49.530
- before people start asking questions?
- What sort of questions?

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.650
The same questions you should be asking yourself.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:54.330
- Like what?
- Like how did you get this suit, the car?

01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:55.810
- I have money.
- From what?

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:59.130
My wife's death. I used to work in insurance. 
We were well covered.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.210
Oh!

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:06.730
So in your grief
you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.570
You don't have a clue, do you?
You don't even know who you are.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:11.890
Yes, I do.

01:05:12.130 --> 01:05:15.490
I don't have amnesia. 
I remember everything right up until the incident.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:17.530
I am Leonard Shelby,
I am from San Francisco...

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.570
That's who you were.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:23.610
You do not know who you are.
What you've become since...

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:25.890
the incident.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:31.610
You wander around playing detective.
You don't even know how long ago it was.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:36.130
Let me put it this way. 
Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.450
- I didn't sell insurance, I investigated it.
- Right, right. You're an investigator.

01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:46.770
- Maybe you should investigate yourself.
- Oh, thank you for the advice.

01:05:47.050 --> 01:05:50.250
Look, do me a favour,
don't go back in there.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:55.010
Will you take the motel out of town?

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.730
It's been fun, Lenny.

01:06:04.570 --> 01:06:08.050
<i>Do not trust her.</i>

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.610
<i>Don't believe his lies.</i>

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:25.930
Oh, fuck it. I need my own place.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.610
No. She shouldn't have given me that responsibility.

01:06:34.850 --> 01:06:38.330
I'm a claims investigator, not a doctor.

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.010
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:44.530
I've got all sorts of other considerations.

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:48.690
Legal responsibility, large financ...

01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:55.650
Who is this?

01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:05.450
Write this down.
Write down what happened.

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:10.610
<i>Write it down. Come on, concentrate.</i>
<i>Keep it in mind. Find a p...</i>

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:18.050
- What happened?
- He beat the shit out of me.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:19.610
Who?

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:21.170
Who?

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:23.610
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:24.770
Why?

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:28.170
Because of you! Because I did 
what you told me to do, reason with him...

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:31.690
- tell him about Teddy. Great idea!
- Calm down. Calm down, take it easy.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.890
You're safe. It's OK.

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.290
Come on. Just sit down. Sit down.

01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:41.850
Here, sit down.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.890
OK. You're OK.

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:48.410
I'll just get some ice for your face.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:56.890
Here.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:03.930
I did exactly what you told me to do.

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:07.330
I went to Dodd...

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:11.410
and I told him
that I didn't have any of Jimmy's money...

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.450
or the drugs.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:17.689
And that this Teddy must have taken everything.

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:20.330
And what did he say?

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:24.450
He didn't believe me.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.770
He said if I don't have the drugs by tomorrow, 
he's gonna kill me.

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:32.410
And then he just...
he just started hitting me.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.450
Where is he?

01:08:34.689 --> 01:08:37.330
- Why?
- I'll go see him.

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:41.689
I'll give him some bruises of his own
and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:45.609
Oh, he'll kill you, Lenny.

01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:50.529
- My wife used to call me Lenny.
- Yeah?

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:53.170
Yeah, I hated it.

01:08:53.410 --> 01:08:58.010
Oh, this guy is so dangerous.
Let's just think of something else, OK?

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:01.649
No, no, no.
You just tell me what he looks like.

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:04.970
And where I can find him.
Have you got a pen?

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:08.689
In my purse.

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:18.450
He'll, um... he'll probably find you.

01:09:18.689 --> 01:09:19.770
What do you mean?

01:09:20.010 --> 01:09:21.729
I told him about your car.

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.649
Why?

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:29.370
He was beating the shit out of me,
I had to tell him something.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:32.930
Just write it all down.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.850
Be careful.

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.569
I'll be fine.

01:09:56.850 --> 01:10:01.250
- A car this nice you should lock.
- Who the fuck are you?

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:19.690
Front desk? Burt, right.
This is Mr Shelby in room 21.

01:10:19.930 --> 01:10:21.730
Yeah, that's it, I don't want any calls.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:25.450
No, none at all.

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:36.210
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:38.250
- Who?
- Calls himself Dodd.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:39.690
What does he want?

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:42.610
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy and his money. 
He thinks I took it.

01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:44.610
Did you?

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:47.730
No.

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:53.450
- What's this all about?
- You don't have a fucking clue, do you?

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.570
You're just blissfully ignorant, aren't you?

01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:59.250
- Look, I have this condition.
- I know all about your fucking condition!

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:02.730
I probably know more about it than you,
you don't have a clue about anything else.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:06.530
- What happened?
- Jimmy went to meet a guy named Teddy.

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:09.170
He took a lot of money with him
and never came back.

01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.130
Jimmy's partners think I set him up.
I don't know if you know this Teddy.

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:15.290
- Neither do I.
- Don't protect him! Help me.

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:18.330
- How?
- Get rid of Dodd for me.

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:20.770
- What?
- Kill him. I'll pay you.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.770
What do you think I am?
I'm not gonna kill someone for money.

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.410
What, then? Love?
What would you kill for?

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:30.090
- You'd kill for your wife, wouldn't you?
- That's different.

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:33.690
- Not to me, I wasn't married to her!
- Hey, don't talk about my wife.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.730
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want!

01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:38.170
I can say whatever I want and you won't remember!

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:40.330
I can call your wife a fucking whore
and we can still be friends.

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:41.970
- Calm down.
- You can't get scared!

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:44.650
You don't know how, you fucking idiot!

01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:46.650
This has nothing to do with me.

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:50.530
How the fuck would you know?
You don't know a fucking thing!

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:53.730
- Hey, can you get angry?
- Yes.

01:11:53.970 --> 01:11:56.010
You pathetic piece of shit!

01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:01.450
I can say whatever the fuck I want 
and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard!

01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:05.490
I'm gonna use you. I'm telling you now
because I'm gonna enjoy it much more...

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.490
if I know that you could stop me
if you weren't such a fucking freak.

01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.970
Did you lose your pen? Too bad, freak.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:15.890
Otherwise you could write yourself a note
about how much Natalie hates your guts...

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:17.810
and that I called your wife a whore!

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:21.490
- Don't say another fucking word!
- About your whore of a wife?

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:26.250
I read about your condition, Leonard.

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:31.530
You know one of the causes of short-term memory loss? 
Venereal disease.

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.370
Maybe your cunt of a fucking wife...

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:38.730
sucked one too many diseased cocks
and turned you into a retard!

01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:43.170
You sad, sad freak.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:49.490
I can say whatever the fuck I want
and you won't remember.

01:12:49.730 --> 01:12:52.610
We'll still be best friends.

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:56.650
Or maybe even lovers.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.930
Fuck!

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.810
I'll see you soon.

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:13.810
<i>Stay focused.</i>

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.850
<i>Find a pen.</i>

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.610
<i>I'm gonna write this down.</i>
<i>I'm gonna write it down.</i>

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:22.970
<i>Concentrate, concentrate, concentrate.</i>

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:28.090
<i>Keep it in mind,</i>
<i>keep it in mind, keep it in mind.</i>

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.890
<i>Come on. I've got to find a pen.</i>
<i>I've got to find a pen.</i>

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:34.770
<i>Now, write this down, write this down.</i>
<i>Exactly what happened.</i>

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.490
<i>I'm gonna write down what happened.</i>
<i>Come on, come on! I've got to find a pen!</i>

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:40.450
<i>Jeez! Come on! Come on, keep focused.</i>

01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:41.770
<i>Keep focused.</i>

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:45.010
<i>Keep... Keep it in mind.</i>
<i>Come on, find a pen.</i>

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.530
<i>Write this note.</i>
<i>Write down what happened. Write it down.</i>

01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:51.530
<i>Come on, concentrate.</i>
<i>Keep it in mind. Find a p...</i>

01:13:58.330 --> 01:13:59.250
What happened?

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:01.290
What does it look like?
He beat the shit out of me.

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:03.330
- Who?
- Who?

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:08.290
Fuck, Leonard, Dodd!
Dodd beat the shit out of me.

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:18.610
- Hello?

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:24.010
It's Burt, from the front desk.

01:14:24.090 --> 01:14:25.290
Yeah?

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:29.490
I know you said you didn't want any calls
but this guy on the phone says he's a cop.

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.570
- A cop?
- Yeah.

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.770
He says you're really gonna wanna know
what he has to say.

01:14:35.010 --> 01:14:38.010
I'm not too good on the phone.
I need to look people in the eye.

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:41.530
Well, what...

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:46.170
You can, um, you can crash on the couch.

01:14:46.410 --> 01:14:49.010
It's comfortable. Just have a seat.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:52.530
Thanks.

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:58.250
So, how long do you think it's gonna take you?

01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:59.290
Hm?

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:03.170
You told me you were looking
for the guy who killed your wife.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:10.530
Oh, it depends on if he's here in town
or if he's moved on. I have my file here.

01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:12.610
Can I ask you something?

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:18.130
If you have all that information,
why haven't the police found him for you?

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:21.170
- They're not looking for him.
- Why not?

01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.930
They don't think he exists.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:31.450
You see, I told them what I remembered.
I was asleep. Something woke me up.

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:40.490
Her side of the bed was cold.
She'd obviously been gone for a while.

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.250
There had to be a second man.

01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:39.690
Somebody hit me from behind.
I remember.

01:16:39.930 --> 01:16:41.370
It's the last thing I do remember.

01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:44.050
Look, the police didn't believe me.
If we check...

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:49.490
How did they explain what you do remember? 
The gun and stuff?

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.730
John G was clever.

01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:54.570
He was clever.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:59.410
He took the dead man's gun 
and replaced it with the sap he hit me with.

01:16:59.650 --> 01:17:03.450
He left my gun and the getaway car.
He gave the police a complete package.

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:08.050
They found the sap with my blood on it
in the dead man's hand.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:10.450
And they only found my gun.

01:17:10.690 --> 01:17:13.490
They didn't need to look for anybody else.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:17.450
I was the only guy who disagreed
with the facts and I had brain damage.

01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:20.490
The cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition.

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:25.130
Leonard. You can stay here for a couple of days 
if it will help you.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.250
Oh, thanks.

01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:31.690
I have to go back to work,
so, um, just make yourself at home.

01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:34.130
You can watch TV or have some food.

01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.650
Whatever you want, OK?
Make yourself at home.

01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:39.890
One thing.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:47.250
- Something to remember you by.
- My name is Natalie.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:50.970
Natalie.

01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:22.090
- What's wrong?
- Somebody's come already.

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:13.850
- On the house.
- Thanks.

01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:20.090
My, you really do have a problem.
Just like that cop said.

01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:24.090
- Hm?
- Your condition.

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:27.010
Well, nobody's perfect.

01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:32.330
What's the last thing that you do remember?

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:35.690
- My wife.
- That's sweet.

01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:38.290
Dying.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:42.490
I remember my wife dying.

01:19:44.490 --> 01:19:47.090
Let me, um, get you another one.

01:19:47.330 --> 01:19:50.730
I think this one's dusty.

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:55.930
Why are you calling me?
What do you want?

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:59.570
I know you're a cop. What do you want?
Have I done something wrong?

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:03.290
I don't know, something bad, maybe.

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:05.730
Look, why are you asking me?
I can't remember what I've done.

01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:07.770
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:10.690
Because of my condition, 
you don't believe someone with this condition.

01:20:10.930 --> 01:20:14.090
Nobody believed Sammy!
I didn't even fucking believe Sammy!

01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:17.810
<i>Ferdy's bar.</i>

01:20:18.370 --> 01:20:22.290
<i>Come by after. Natalie.</i>

01:20:35.090 --> 01:20:36.810
- A beer, please.
- What do you want?

01:20:37.050 --> 01:20:37.850
A beer, please.

01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:40.250
You can't just waltz in here dressed like that 
and ask for a beer.

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:42.570
- What, is there a dress code?
- Why are you here?

01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:45.490
- I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
- Well, that's me.

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:48.930
Yeah, we met before, right?

01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:51.170
- Then why am I here?
- I don't know, why don't you tell me?

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:53.210
I don't remember.
I have no short-term memory.

01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:55.010
Oh, you're that memory guy.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.690
- How do you know about me?
- My boyfriend told me about you.

01:20:58.930 --> 01:21:03.610
- Oh, yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:05.050
No.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:10.250
He knows you. He told me about you.
He said you were staying at the Discount.

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:13.490
In fact, a cop came by earlier
and was looking for you.

01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:15.610
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything...

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:17.650
wouldn't know how he'd got here
or what he'd done.

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:19.570
I get a lot of guys round here like that.

01:21:19.810 --> 01:21:25.610
Chronic alcoholism
is one cause of short-term memory loss.

01:21:25.730 --> 01:21:28.530
- Are you Teddy?
- No, my name's Leonard.

01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:31.170
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

01:21:31.410 --> 01:21:33.210
What's happened to Jimmy?

01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:36.850
- I don't know that, either. Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:40.370
You don't remember where you've been
or what you've just done?

01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:43.850
I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:48.250
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:53.450
Your pocket?

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:17.850
Bar bet. Care to contribute?

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.570
- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:26.090
Come on. Proceeds are going to charity.
Help me out.

01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:38.730
Thank you.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:56.570
- On the house.
- Thanks.

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:03.250
It's completely fucked because nobody believes you.

01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:06.890
It's amazing what a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:09.210
I guess it's poetic justice
for not believing Sammy.

01:23:09.450 --> 01:23:13.890
You know the truth about my condition, officer? 
You don't know anything.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:18.850
You feel angry, you don't know why.
You feel guilty, you have no idea why.

01:23:19.090 --> 01:23:22.290
You could do anything 
and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later.

01:23:22.530 --> 01:23:25.250
Like Sammy.
What if I'd done something like Sammy?

01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:29.090
I didn't tell you?
What happened to Sammy and his wife?

01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:31.250
She came to see me at my office.

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:36.050
<i>I didn't tell her what I really thought</i>
<i>but I never said that he was faking.</i>

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:38.250
<i>Just that his condition was mental,</i>
<i>not physical.</i>

01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:42.530
<i>I found out later that she went home</i>
<i>and gave Sammy his final exam.</i>

01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:47.010
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:03.650
<i>She knew beyond a doubt that he loved her,</i>

01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:08.010
<i>so she found a way to test him.</i>

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:22.090
Sammy? It's time for my shot.

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.810
Hm.

01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:34.730
<i>- She really thought she'd call his bluff.</i>
- There you go.

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:41.010
<i>Or she just didn't want to live with the things</i>
<i>she'd put him through.</i>

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.730
Sammy?

01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:54.170
It's time for my shot.

01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:01.810
It won't hurt.

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:45.330
<i>She went into a coma and never recovered.</i>

01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:48.530
<i>Sammy couldn't understand</i>
<i>or explain what happened.</i>

01:25:48.770 --> 01:25:50.570
Oh!

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:54.930
He's been in a home ever since.
He doesn't even know his wife is dead.

01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:58.250
I was wrong about Sammy
and I was wrong about his wife.

01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:02.330
She wasn't interested in the money.
She needed to understand his problem.

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:05.970
<i>His brain didn't respond to conditioning</i>
<i>but he wasn't a con man.</i>

01:26:06.210 --> 01:26:09.330
<i>And when she looked into his eyes,</i>
<i>she thought he could be the same person.</i>

01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:11.410
<i>When I looked into his eyes,</i>
<i>I thought I saw recognition.</i>

01:26:11.650 --> 01:26:13.450
Now I know you fake it.

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:16.490
If you think you're supposed to recognise somebody, 
you pretend to.

01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:20.010
<i>You bluff it to get a pat on the head</i>
<i>from the doctors.</i>

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:24.730
You bluff it to seem less of a freak.

01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:27.330
What drug dealer?

01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:54.210
- Hey, Lenny, how you doing?
- It's private back here.

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:57.170
- It's OK, we know each other. Right, kid?
- How did you know I was in here?

01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:59.170
The Jag's out front.

01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:02.130
What are you still doing here, Lenny?
There's plenty of tattoo parlours up north.

01:27:02.370 --> 01:27:05.570
I guess I wanted to get something down
before it slipped my mind.

01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:07.530
- Give me the keys, I'll move it.
- It'll be all right.

01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:09.570
- Wait out there.
- Oh, for Christ...

01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:13.370
Give me a minute,
I've got to get something for you.

01:27:16.290 --> 01:27:21.210
<i>Fact six. Car licence SG13 7IU.</i>

01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:30.250
Look, wait a minute, will ya?

01:27:31.290 --> 01:27:33.330
- We gotta get you out of here.
- Why?

01:27:33.570 --> 01:27:36.250
Oh, man. Come on, Leonard.
How many times I gotta tell you?

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:38.690
- It's not safe for you to hang around.
- Why not?

01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:41.970
Because that cop's looking for you.
I gotta get you a new identity...

01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:45.290
some new clothes, a different car would do for now. 
Put these on.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:47.170
Whoa, whoa. What cop?

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:51.170
He's a bad cop. 
He's the one that checked you into the Discount Inn.

01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:55.010
He's been calling you for days, 
slipping envelopes under your door, shit like that.

01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:58.930
- How do you know this?
- He told me. He's been laughing at you.

01:27:59.170 --> 01:28:00.370
- You're full of shit.
- No, I'm not.

01:28:00.610 --> 01:28:02.410
He knows you're no good on the phone
so he's been calling you up.

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:04.410
Sometimes you don't answer the phone...

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:07.170
so he slips shit under your door
to scare you into answering it...

01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:12.210
giving you a line of crap about John G
being a local drug dealer. Jimmy Grants.

01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:14.970
- Who's Jimmy Grants?
- Leonard, Jimmy's the drug dealer.

01:28:15.210 --> 01:28:18.410
The cop wants to know how his operation is run. 
He's got some score in mind.

01:28:18.650 --> 01:28:20.930
- Somehow you're involved.
- How do you know him?

01:28:21.170 --> 01:28:26.490
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town.
The local boys put us together.

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:28.810
If he knew I was helping you,
he'd fucking kill me.

01:28:29.050 --> 01:28:32.530
So take these clothes, 
put them on and get the fuck out of here.

01:28:32.770 --> 01:28:36.090
Come on, Leonard, just go.

01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:57.410
You are full of shit.

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:01.010
<i>Come by after. Natalie.</i>

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:04.610
<i>Ferdy's bar.</i>

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:46.890
Hey, Jimmy.

01:29:46.890 --> 01:29:50.010
I'm sorry, I, uh,
thought you were somebody else.

01:29:50.250 --> 01:29:51.850
Sorry.

01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:55.570
That's OK.

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:11.250
This Jimmy Grants deals drugs out of the bar 
where his girlfriend works?

01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:14.890
But he's not going to bring her along?
He'll come by himself, right?

01:30:15.130 --> 01:30:18.850
I always figured the drugs angle
would be the best way to get him.

01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:22.210
No, officer. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:26.250
You're in the lobby?
What do you look like?

01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:28.930
I'll be right there.

01:31:08.770 --> 01:31:11.170
Lenny!

01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:15.290
Officer Gammell?

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:20.130
Yeah. Come on.

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:38.090
- Hey, smile.
- Oh, don't, uh... Not here.

01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:41.810
Over here.

01:31:44.610 --> 01:31:47.010
Is it Officer or Lieutenant Gammell?

01:31:47.250 --> 01:31:49.970
You know what?
Don't write Gammell, just Teddy.

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:54.250
- Why?
- I'm undercover.

01:31:55.330 --> 01:31:57.810
This is the directions, where he's going.

01:31:58.050 --> 01:32:00.650
- My number's on the bottom if you...
- You're not coming?

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:05.090
Nah, it wouldn't be appropriate.

01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:11.450
Nice picture. I look thin.

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:15.170
Hey, Lenny!

01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:18.290
Make him beg.

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:39.490
Teddy!

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:42.650
Hey, Teddy!

01:33:44.050 --> 01:33:47.330
Teddy!

01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:50.810
Jimmy.

01:33:51.050 --> 01:33:54.010
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You Jimmy Grants?

01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.010
Expecting any other Jimmys, memory man?

01:33:56.250 --> 01:34:00.170
- Do you remember me?
- Yeah, I remember you.

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:02.570
Where the fuck's Teddy?

01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:05.370
Well?

01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:09.050
Motherfuck!

01:34:09.290 --> 01:34:11.610
What are you doing?

01:34:12.170 --> 01:34:13.170
Strip.

01:34:13.410 --> 01:34:17.290
- You're making a big fucking mistake!
- Strip!

01:34:17.290 --> 01:34:20.090
My associates are not the kind of people
you wanna piss off.

01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:21.770
Don't say anything else.

01:34:22.010 --> 01:34:26.410
- I knew I couldn't trust that fuck!
- Take it off.

01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:31.850
Your pants, too.

01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:34.290
- Why?
- I don't wanna get blood on them.

01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:38.210
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!
Did he tell you what I was bringing?

01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:42.090
- Take your fuckin' pants off!
- I've got two hundred grand in the car!

01:34:42.330 --> 01:34:44.730
- Just take it!
- You think you can bargain with me?

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:47.050
- Just take the money and walk away.
- I don't want your fucking money.

01:34:47.290 --> 01:34:49.450
Then, what?

01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:54.370
- What do you want from me?
- I want my fucking life back!

01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:23.250
Sammy.

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:30.130
<i>He said Sammy.</i>
<i>How does he know about Sammy?</i>

01:36:30.370 --> 01:36:33.850
Oh, fuck.

01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:54.330
<i>What have I done?</i>

01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:55.570
Hey, mister! I need help!

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:59.090
There's a guy in here, he's hurt bad.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

01:36:59.330 --> 01:37:01.410
All right.

01:37:01.650 --> 01:37:03.690
I don't know what happened.
I've got this memory thing.

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:06.610
- Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry, I'm a cop.

01:37:06.850 --> 01:37:09.850
- Is he still breathing?
- Well, I don't know. Maybe.

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:14.730
- What the hell were you guys doing?
- I don't remember, I have this condition.

01:37:14.970 --> 01:37:18.050
I hope it's not as serious as his
cos this guy's dead.

01:37:18.290 --> 01:37:21.850
- Ow! Lenny! That shit kills!
- So you remember me now, huh?

01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:26.370
- You are a fucking cop!
- And I'm the guy that helped you find him.

01:37:26.610 --> 01:37:32.450
- Get up! Get up!
- Lenny, you got the wrong idea!

01:37:33.690 --> 01:37:35.530
Who is that? He knew me.

01:37:35.770 --> 01:37:38.170
Of course he did, he raped your wife,
he fucked up your brain.

01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:40.210
Bullshit! He's not the guy.

01:37:40.450 --> 01:37:44.010
His name is James F Grants. John G.
Check your tattoos.

01:37:44.250 --> 01:37:48.370
- Why did he bring two hundred grand?
- What?

01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:50.810
- What was it for?
- Amphetamines I told him I had.

01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:54.330
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

01:37:54.570 --> 01:37:57.770
Look, Jimmy's your guy. 
I figured we'd make a few dollars on the side.

01:37:58.010 --> 01:38:00.610
- How did he know me?
- The Discount Inn.

01:38:00.850 --> 01:38:04.890
He dealt out of there. The guy at the front desk 
let him know if anybody came round.

01:38:05.130 --> 01:38:07.170
He called Jimmy
the minute he saw you taking a picture.

01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:09.570
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half.

01:38:09.810 --> 01:38:12.050
He knew about Sammy,
why would I tell him about Sammy?!

01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:15.370
You tell everybody about Sammy!
Everybody who'll listen!

01:38:15.610 --> 01:38:17.490
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

01:38:17.730 --> 01:38:20.530
Great story.
Gets better every time you tell it.

01:38:20.770 --> 01:38:24.370
So you lie to yourself to be happy.
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:38:24.610 --> 01:38:29.410
We all do it. Who cares if there's a few little details 
you'd rather not remember?

01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:32.850
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:38:33.090 --> 01:38:37.570
Your wife surviving the assault.
Her not believing your condition.

01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:42.610
The torment and pain and anguish
tearing her up inside.

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:45.090
The insulin.

01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:47.770
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

01:38:48.010 --> 01:38:50.730
Yeah, right.
Like you tell yourself over and over again.

01:38:50.970 --> 01:38:54.170
Condtitioning yourself to remember,
learning through repetition.

01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:56.970
Sammy let his wife kill herself.
Sammy ended up in an institution.

01:38:57.210 --> 01:39:00.210
Sammy was a con man. A faker.

01:39:00.450 --> 01:39:02.370
I never said that Sammy was faking.

01:39:02.610 --> 01:39:05.210
You exposed him for what he was.
A fraud.

01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:08.290
I was wrong. That's the whole point.

01:39:08.530 --> 01:39:13.170
- See, Sammy's wife came to me...
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:18.530
It was your wife who had diabetes.

01:39:22.650 --> 01:39:25.130
Ouch!

01:39:25.650 --> 01:39:28.210
My wife wasn't diabetic.

01:39:28.450 --> 01:39:31.930
You sure?

01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:36.370
Ouch! Cut it out!

01:39:36.610 --> 01:39:38.410
She wasn't diabetic.

01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:42.090
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:39:42.330 --> 01:39:45.090
I guess I can only make you remember 
the things you want to be true.

01:39:45.330 --> 01:39:47.810
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

01:39:48.050 --> 01:39:49.970
He was to you.

01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:53.290
Come on, you got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:55.810
What difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

01:39:56.050 --> 01:39:57.930
- It makes all the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:59.730
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:02.130
- Somehow I'll know.
- You won't remember!

01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.610
When it's done, I will know.

01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:08.330
I thought so, too, I was sure of it,
but you didn't!

01:40:10.330 --> 01:40:14.930
That's right. The real John G.
I helped you find him over a year ago.

01:40:15.170 --> 01:40:17.770
- He's already dead.
- Don't lie to me any more.

01:40:18.010 --> 01:40:19.850
Look, Lenny...

01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:23.010
I was the cop assigned to your wife's case, 
I believed you.

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:25.490
I thought you deserved a chance for revenge.

01:40:25.730 --> 01:40:28.810
I'm the one that helped you find the other guy 
in your bathroom that night.

01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:31.050
The guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:35.130
We found him, you killed him.

01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:37.370
But you didn't remember.

01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:42.410
So I helped you start looking again,
looking for the guy you already killed.

01:40:42.650 --> 01:40:47.010
- Oh, yeah? So who was he?
- Just some guy. Does it matter who?

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:51.650
No reason, Lenny, no conspiracy,
just bad fucking luck.

01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:56.770
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realise your wife didn't live alone.

01:40:56.970 --> 01:41:01.410
But when you killed him
I was so convinced that you'd remember.

01:41:01.650 --> 01:41:03.890
But it didn't stick.

01:41:04.130 --> 01:41:07.770
Like nothing ever sticks,
like this won't stick.

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.290
I took that picture.

01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:16.010
Just when you did it.

01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:21.770
Look how happy you are.
I wanted to see that face again.

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:24.250
- Oh, gee, thanks!
- Fuck you.

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:28.210
I gave you a reason to live
and you were more than happy to help.

01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:34.450
You don't want the truth. 
You make up your own truth, like your police file.

01:41:34.690 --> 01:41:37.490
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the twelve pages?

01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:38.890
You, probably.

01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:41.290
- No, it wasn't me, see, it was you.
- Why would I do that?

01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:44.090
To create a puzzle you could never solve.

01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:46.090
Do you know how many towns...

01:41:46.330 --> 01:41:50.210
how many John Gs or James Gs?
I mean, shit, Lenny, I'm a fucking John G.

01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:53.370
- Your name's Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

01:41:53.610 --> 01:41:55.410
My name's John Edward Gammell.

01:41:55.650 --> 01:42:01.730
Cheer up. 
There's plenty of John Gs for us to find.

01:42:03.570 --> 01:42:07.610
All you do is moan! 
I'm the one that has to live with what you've done.

01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:09.650
I'm the one that put it all together.

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:14.210
You, you wander around, you're playing detective. 
You're living a dream, kid.

01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:17.170
A dead wife to pine for,
a sense of purpose to your life...

01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:22.650
a romantic quest that you wouldn't end
even if I wasn't in the picture.

01:42:22.890 --> 01:42:25.770
- I should kill you.
- Quit it! Lenny, come on.

01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:30.410
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:32.730
Come on, what are you doing?

01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:38.530
You know what time it is?
It's beer o'clock, I'm buying.

01:42:38.690 --> 01:42:42.170
Fuck!

01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:51.770
<i>I'm not a killer.</i>

01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:56.850
<i>I'm just someone who wanted to make things right.</i>

01:42:59.450 --> 01:43:04.770
<i>Can I just let myself forget</i>
<i>what you've told me?</i>

01:43:19.050 --> 01:43:22.530
<i>Can I just let myself forget</i>
<i>what you made me do?</i>

01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:40.330
<i>You think I just want another puzzle to solve?</i>
<i>Another John G to look for?</i>

01:43:40.570 --> 01:43:44.290
<i>You're a John G.</i>

01:43:45.130 --> 01:43:48.650
<i>So you can be my John G.</i>

01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:57.730
<i>Do I lie to myself to be happy?</i>

01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:00.770
<i>In your case, Teddy...</i>

01:44:01.290 --> 01:44:04.770
<i>yes, I will.</i>

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:17.090
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

01:44:17.330 --> 01:44:20.130
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.450
- Why not?
- Because the guy you just killed owns it!

01:44:22.690 --> 01:44:26.010
Somebody'll recognise it.

01:44:26.250 --> 01:44:29.930
You know, I think I'd rather be mistaken 
for a dead guy than a killer.

01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:33.130
I might hang on to this for a while.

01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:35.010
Lenny.

01:44:35.250 --> 01:44:38.530
Look, don't...
Will you help me find the keys?

01:44:38.770 --> 01:44:40.570
Help me find my keys!

01:44:40.810 --> 01:44:43.130
Lenny!

01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:50.090
Lenny!

01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:05.210
<i>I have to believe in a world</i>
<i>outside my own mind.</i>

01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:07.250
<i>I have to believe</i>
<i>that my actions still have meaning.</i>

01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:10.770
<i>Even if I can't remember them.</i>

01:45:11.010 --> 01:45:17.010
<i>I have to believe that when my eyes are closed,</i>
<i>the world's still here.</i>

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:21.050
<i>Do I believe the world's still here?</i>

01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:25.370
<i>Is it still out there?</i>

01:45:26.850 --> 01:45:30.050
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:45:30.810 --> 01:45:34.970
<i>We all need memories</i>
<i>to remind ourselves who we are.</i>

01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:38.890
<i>I'm no different.</i>

01:45:49.410 --> 01:45:52.570
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

01:45:59.850 --> 01:46:04.330
<i>We lay in each other's arms</i>

01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:08.970
<i>But the room is just an empty space</i>

01:46:09.210 --> 01:46:12.570
<i>I guess we lived it out</i>

01:46:12.810 --> 01:46:15.890
<i>Something in the air</i>

01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:17.490
<i>We smile too fast</i>

01:46:17.730 --> 01:46:22.610
<i>Then can't think of a thing to say</i>

01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:27.010
<i>Lived with the best times</i>

01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:31.490
<i>Left with the worst</i>

01:46:32.850 --> 01:46:37.930
<i>I've danced with you too long</i>

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:41.410
<i>Nothing left to save</i>

01:46:41.650 --> 01:46:47.010
<i>There's something in the air</i>

01:46:47.250 --> 01:46:50.850
<i>Something in my eye</i>

01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:55.970
<i>I've danced with you too long</i>

01:46:56.210 --> 01:46:58.370
<i>Yeah</i>

01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:02.690
<i>Something in the air</i>

01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:08.490
<i>Something in my eye</i>

01:47:18.610 --> 01:47:20.610
<i>Abracadoo</i>

01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:24.330
<i>I lose you</i>

01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:26.930
<i>We can't avoid the clash</i>

01:47:27.170 --> 01:47:30.650
<i>The big mistake</i>

01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:34.730
<i>Now we're gonna pay and pay</i>

01:47:35.250 --> 01:47:41.570
<i>I guess you know</i>
<i>I never wanted anyone more than you</i>

01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:46.050
<i>Lived all our best times</i>

01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:51.010
<i>Left with the worst</i>

01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:56.850
<i>I've danced with you too long</i>

01:47:57.850 --> 01:48:00.210
<i>Say what you will</i>

01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:07.330
<i>But there's something in the air</i>

01:48:08.050 --> 01:48:10.290
<i>Something in my eye</i>

01:48:10.530 --> 01:48:16.410
<i>I've danced with you too long</i>

01:48:17.690 --> 01:48:21.530
<i>There's something I have to say</i>

01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:26.010
<i>There's something in the air</i>

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:31.770
<i>I've danced with you too long</i>

01:48:32.305 --> 01:48:38.282
