I had a dress picked out.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.724
I was going to look like Judy Garland.

02:20.850 --> 02:22.726
I told you to tell them!

02:24.520 --> 02:26.188
Sorry. I'm sorry.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.190
I forgot to tell you. I'm sorry.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.318
I said I'm sorry, didn't I?
I don't know, I'm sorry!

02:31.402 --> 02:34.321
But you've had three months
and haven't learned

02:34.405 --> 02:37.533
a word of English!
You could have done it yourself.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.410
Am I your translator?

02:48.752 --> 02:54.008
I know I made a great catch.
I feel good on the field.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.969
I don't know why they didn't
take me to the movies!

30:28.369 --> 30:31.789
I came from very
far away to play here.

30:31.872 --> 30:36.377
Even though you ignore me
and make me feel like a ghost.
