WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.704
Sam: Tilty-whirly-thingy?
Clint: Nope.

00:05.705 --> 00:09.641
Seriously? You're gonna
stand here on
our one day off,

00:09.643 --> 00:11.710
Knocking down milk bottles
for stuffed animals?

00:11.712 --> 00:14.213
You spend your day
at the carnival your way,

00:14.481 --> 00:16.382
And I'll spend it my way.
(grunts)

00:24.524 --> 00:25.691
Gammi bear?

00:26.059 --> 00:27.226
(squeaks)

00:28.194 --> 00:29.795
Well, meet me back here
when you're ready to hurl.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.231
Man, I should've
brought the hulk.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.101
Whoa!

00:36.736 --> 00:38.337
(grunts)

00:38.772 --> 00:40.105
He's back.
Who's back?

00:40.340 --> 00:41.407
Molecule man.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.108
Molecule man?

00:48.314 --> 00:52.251
Clint:  <i>Last time</i>
<i>molecule man came to town,</i>
<i>he almost left with it too.</i>

00:57.390 --> 00:58.524
(growling)

00:59.426 --> 01:01.093
<i>His wand could change</i>
<i>any kind of molecule</i>

01:01.095 --> 01:02.828
<i>Into any other kind</i>
<i>of molecule.</i>

01:02.830 --> 01:04.096
(grunts)

01:08.601 --> 01:10.269
(straining) huh?

01:14.607 --> 01:15.741
(grunts)

01:18.711 --> 01:21.480
Clint:  <i>Not exactly</i>
<i>a good power</i>
<i>for a good guy either.</i>

01:23.650 --> 01:25.717
But, thanks to my expert shot,

01:25.719 --> 01:28.821
We didn't have to worry
about the wand
falling into anyone's hands.

01:29.222 --> 01:30.389
(metal clinking)

01:32.125 --> 01:33.659
Great shot.
Thanks for keeping me

01:33.661 --> 01:36.795
From being able to dissect
the invention of the century.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.130
Sorry.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.299
We gotta tell tony.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.202
This goes no further than us.
We bring him in.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.604
Rust head won't like that.
We do this my way.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.672
(grunts)

01:47.474 --> 01:49.675
We do it my way.
Fury's orders.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.144
Our mission
is to secure the tech,

01:52.146 --> 01:54.179
Tech fury thought
was destroyed,

01:54.181 --> 01:55.848
Tech fury thinks
would be far too dangerous

01:55.850 --> 01:58.750
In the hands of an inventor
with stark's curiosity.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.854
All I'm saying is,
tony's gonna be peeved
when he finds out.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.522
Sam: Oh, widow.

02:03.756 --> 02:06.391
It was you up here. Cool.
When tony finds out what?

02:06.393 --> 02:08.827
A different tony...
She said tony must not owe
me for our last poker game...

02:08.829 --> 02:10.863
Black widow: We were
talking about planning
a little birthday...

02:10.865 --> 02:12.764
Hawkeye: ...Totally
would've paid me
because he's really rich.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.333
Yes, your poker game.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.734
Exactly.
A surprise party.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.669
A surprise poker party.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.204
For some other tony.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.609
Fine. Keep it to yourselves.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.377
But I wouldn't cross iron man.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.846
Anyway, I'll be
on the viking swing.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.250
A surprise poker party?

02:31.252 --> 02:32.384
That isn't even a thing.

02:32.386 --> 02:35.787
If tony gets
to molecule man
before we do.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.922
Let's move.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.827
So, you got
molecule's cell digits,

02:41.829 --> 02:44.229
Or are we just supposed
to search every street
in new york city?

02:44.231 --> 02:48.467
And if you can't take
my mission plan seriously,
I'll do it myself.

02:48.469 --> 02:53.272
P.S., I can take a mission
un-seriously and still ace it.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.677
(grunts) thanks.

03:02.248 --> 03:03.715
Totally knew
you would do that.

03:04.217 --> 03:05.417
There.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.621
(sighs) I could've
done this in my sleep.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.857
One knock-out arrow
and I'm back to winning
stuffed pandas.

03:13.793 --> 03:14.960
(yells)

03:15.662 --> 03:17.763
Hey!
He's carrying
dangerous cargo.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.198
We have to
secure it before...

03:19.432 --> 03:21.433
Before he can disappear
with it?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.302
How did we get made?
'cause it wasn't me.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.771
Sure. The talking
at full volume
didn't raise any flags.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.838
Amateur!
(chuckles)

03:26.840 --> 03:27.906
Don't blame me, super-spy.

03:29.000 --> 03:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:37.884 --> 03:40.886
A.I.M. Agents.
That's what
he's running from.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.288
(weapons powering up)

03:43.723 --> 03:44.790
Uh... Um...

03:45.825 --> 03:46.959
(grunts)

03:48.728 --> 03:50.696
You're not taking
my dad's wand!

03:51.364 --> 03:52.798
Black widow:
That's not molecule man.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.466
More like molecule kid.

04:02.642 --> 04:03.709
Hey, what...

04:05.812 --> 04:06.979
We just got slimed!

04:07.347 --> 04:08.847
(grunts)
ah! No!

04:28.301 --> 04:29.735
(straining)

04:33.573 --> 04:35.007
(grunting)

04:40.513 --> 04:41.747
Hawkeye: (scoffs) look at him.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.348
All that power
in his hands,

04:43.350 --> 04:45.317
And he doesn't even know
what to do with it.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.953
I think iron man
would be pretty useful
right about now.

04:47.955 --> 04:52.524
Fury doesn't want the wand
in any one person's hands,
especially mr. Impulsive.

04:52.526 --> 04:55.527
If I was in charge,
I would've brought along
a hulk or something.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.432
Aim agent 1: Over here!
Aim agent 2: Hey!

05:01.434 --> 05:02.567
(grunts)

05:07.674 --> 05:08.907
(yells)

05:09.375 --> 05:11.476
This wand is all
I have left of my father.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.712
There's no way
you're getting it from me.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.480
(grunts)

05:16.983 --> 05:18.550
(laughs) uh-oh.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.388
(yells)

05:27.994 --> 05:29.361
(groaning)

05:31.497 --> 05:32.998
(horn honks)
(crashing)

05:34.500 --> 05:35.701
(tires screeching)

05:35.703 --> 05:37.569
There's mud
in your eye.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.771
And your nose and your ears...

05:39.773 --> 05:42.007
Joke later.
He's running away again.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.475
(beeps)

05:43.876 --> 05:45.010
Hmm?

05:47.113 --> 05:48.814
(cars crashing)
(car alarms blaring)

05:53.953 --> 05:55.821
Permission to fire
the champion shot

05:55.823 --> 05:57.956
You should've let me fire
back in the alley, sir!

05:57.958 --> 06:01.026
Permission to stop talking
and start shooting granted.

06:07.800 --> 06:10.135
Do you not get it?
I have his power now.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.504
Me! I'm not
afraid to use it!

06:18.111 --> 06:20.479
Aah! Where'd you
learn to drive, huh?
Video games?

06:20.481 --> 06:21.546
Aah!
Hush!

06:26.486 --> 06:28.120
Hawkeye: Have you thought
about what we're gonna do

06:28.122 --> 06:29.521
If junior turns us
into bratwursts?

06:29.756 --> 06:31.723
I see you as
more of a hot dog.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.192
But the wand can't affect
organic matter.
Take the wheel.

06:37.997 --> 06:39.064
Turn!

06:41.667 --> 06:43.168
(grunts)
(hawkeye yelling)

06:50.977 --> 06:52.043
Uh...

06:55.081 --> 06:57.649
Whoever you are,
leave me alone!

06:57.950 --> 07:00.619
We're avengers,
the really good guys.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.554
(quietly)
hey, how are you with kids?

07:02.556 --> 07:04.456
(sighs) playtime is over.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.024
The wand. Now.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.959
Question answered.
Not so good.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.163
A.I.M.! Avengers!
You're all the same.

07:13.533 --> 07:15.167
(both yelling)

07:15.169 --> 07:16.902
In my hair!

07:24.210 --> 07:25.544
(grunts)

07:27.046 --> 07:28.213
See ya at the top.

07:31.551 --> 07:32.651
(yells)

07:33.152 --> 07:34.686
(both grunt)

07:34.688 --> 07:35.754
<i>Pozhaluista.</i>

07:36.189 --> 07:37.155
What's that?

07:37.890 --> 07:39.191
That's russian
for "you're welcome."

07:44.931 --> 07:46.097
Stop!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.867
You're scared. Fine.
You should be.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.702
But let us help you.
(grunts)

07:52.839 --> 07:54.005
Whoa!
Whoa!

07:54.207 --> 07:55.874
Help me, like
you helped my dad?

07:56.242 --> 07:57.943
Send me away like you did him?

07:57.945 --> 08:00.512
You just want to take
what everyone else
wants from me.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.681
He does
have a point.

08:03.716 --> 08:04.816
Whoa!

08:05.652 --> 08:09.187
Molecule kid just made
those cars a lot heavier.

08:14.727 --> 08:18.563
Okay. What we have here
is more scared kid
than crazed super-villain.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.099
Can you just mommy-talk him
before he destroys the city?

08:21.101 --> 08:26.872
You did not just say that
with me positioned to kick
you in many painful places.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.040
(rumbling)

08:32.979 --> 08:34.212
(grunts) give me the wand!

08:34.714 --> 08:36.181
Black widow: Or else!
(grunts)

08:39.818 --> 08:41.052
Leave me alone!

08:42.621 --> 08:43.788
Whoa!

08:43.789 --> 08:46.191
(grunts) honey?
Yes, dear?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.927
No. We're
stuck in honey.

08:49.161 --> 08:51.563
You said the wand
doesn't do organics,

08:51.565 --> 08:53.865
So this isn't honey, honey.

08:57.937 --> 09:01.039
Hey, great mission plan
so far, by the way.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.874
Perfection. Really.

09:04.677 --> 09:05.944
You look stuck.

09:06.145 --> 09:08.980
Captain america? How...

09:09.115 --> 09:11.583
I was walloping
batroc the leaper
over on 3rd

09:11.585 --> 09:13.285
When I noticed 5th
had gone vertical.

09:13.287 --> 09:17.222
Because tony cannot know
this kind of power's
in the city,

09:17.224 --> 09:18.957
By order of nick fury.

09:19.258 --> 09:23.161
Did you tell fury
our team comes first?
Or does it for you?

09:23.163 --> 09:28.600
Imagine if tony
no longer had to follow
the rules of physics.

09:29.268 --> 09:30.735
Understood.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.837
We need to keep this
away from tony.

09:32.839 --> 09:36.107
Still, aren't you
the world's greatest super-spy
and most expert marksman?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.609
You can't handle a kid?

09:37.611 --> 09:39.077
If hawkeye had let me
deal with this

09:39.079 --> 09:40.879
Instead of trying
to grandstand...

09:40.881 --> 09:43.281
She can't be left alone
for a second!

09:43.884 --> 09:48.019
Yeah, while you're
both being right,
your target's getting away.

09:48.187 --> 09:49.754
Help me!

09:50.957 --> 09:53.158
<i>I will help myself</i>
<i>to your wand.</i>

09:54.193 --> 09:55.126
(molecule kid screams)

09:55.128 --> 09:57.162
The adaptoid? Here?

09:57.164 --> 09:58.897
Now it's a party.

10:06.839 --> 10:07.939
Call tony?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.207
We do not call tony!

10:09.942 --> 10:11.209
(straining)

10:16.248 --> 10:18.116
(grunts)
(groans)

10:18.718 --> 10:21.186
You're safe, son.
I suggest you hand over
that wand.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.122
It won't work for you.
For anyone.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.323
Only me.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.626
My dad made it that way.

10:31.063 --> 10:32.330
(grunting)
ohh!

10:35.701 --> 10:37.235
Hawkeye: Go help cap.
I've got the kid.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.337
You go help cap.
I've got the kid.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.007
I can handle
a shape-shifting robot.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.274
Seriously, go help cap.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.310
It's too much for you.
You go help cap.

10:45.778 --> 10:46.845
Falcon: I got cap.

10:47.747 --> 10:49.347
You two stay on robo-snot.
I'll call tony.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.049
Do not call tony!

10:51.717 --> 10:52.884
(grunting)

10:53.152 --> 10:54.753
(grunting)

10:56.222 --> 10:57.188
(both grunt)

11:01.060 --> 11:03.928
<i>I now control</i>
<i>this marvelous creature.</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:07.832
If he gets ahold
of that wand,
we're all doomed.

11:08.734 --> 11:09.901
(both groan)

11:11.937 --> 11:14.806
There is no point
in running, boy.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.875
(grunts) why isn't
this working?

11:17.076 --> 11:19.177
Hawkeye: It is working.
It's an adaptoid.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.745
It adapts.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.280
How do I fight
something like that?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.015
You don't. We do.

11:34.894 --> 11:36.027
(grunts)

11:37.063 --> 11:39.698
You narrow-minded fools
would lock the wand in a safe,

11:41.133 --> 11:45.036
<i>But red skull</i>
<i>and I will use it</i>
<i>to reshape tomorrow!</i>

11:48.274 --> 11:51.142
Looks like everyone
wants your gadget, kid.
(grunts)

11:52.111 --> 11:54.713
You've got two options.
Let it fall into the hands

11:54.715 --> 11:56.114
Of one of humanity's
greatest enemies,

11:56.116 --> 11:59.084
Or hand it to the hero,
I.E., me.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.119
I'll take option three...
Keep it!

12:02.988 --> 12:04.022
(grunts)

12:08.394 --> 12:10.061
Archer could use some help
containing the kid.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.030
Leave adaptoid
to me and falcon.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.032
Took him out once,
I can definitely do it again.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.767
Go!
Ow, ow, ow!

12:17.436 --> 12:19.237
Why can't everyone just...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.372
Just leave me alone?
(siren wailing)

12:21.374 --> 12:26.811
You may not be trying
to hurt anyone,
but damage is being done.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.114
You can't control the power
you're wielding.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.181
No one can.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.016
Then why should
I give it to you?

12:32.018 --> 12:35.153
Because I can make sure
no one ever uses it again.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.189
Giving it up now
would be good.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.392
And you are
a good person, aaron.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.164
Hawkeye: Don't bother trying
to trick him out of it, widow.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.033
He already knows
we want the wand
just like everyone else.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.268
What are you doing?

12:50.270 --> 12:53.138
That touchy-feely stuff
never works.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.874
Stand back
and let me talk to him,
maverick to maverick.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.408
You're doing
your own thing, kid.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.010
Following in
the old man's footies.

12:59.012 --> 13:03.148
The buddy angle scenario
doesn't work with teens.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.316
Pathetic. Maybe I should've
brought iron man.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.952
Who's rescued you
from sticky situations
twice today?

13:07.954 --> 13:10.088
Iron man? Puh-lease!

13:10.090 --> 13:12.090
I was not rescued. Ugh!

13:12.092 --> 13:14.159
I should've just
handled this myself!

13:14.161 --> 13:15.794
Stop fighting!

13:16.061 --> 13:18.997
That's all my dad
ever did with this thing.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.098
That's why
my mom went away.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.000
That's why my dad
got sent away!

13:22.002 --> 13:27.038
I have the power now.
I didn't want to use it,
but people...

13:27.040 --> 13:30.408
You people gave me no choice!

13:47.893 --> 13:48.960
<i>What?</i>

13:49.795 --> 13:52.030
Molecule man
couldn't do this,
could he?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.131
Definitely not.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.465
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

13:54.467 --> 13:55.900
But maybe
we should call...

13:55.902 --> 13:57.202
Iron man: Iron man?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.204
(thrusters powering down)

13:59.438 --> 14:01.172
Looks like you need a hand...

14:01.174 --> 14:02.874
One with a repulsor ray.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.409
(groans)

14:07.079 --> 14:09.047
That was remarkably easy.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.882
What have you been doing
this whole time?

14:10.884 --> 14:15.453
I assume fury told you
to keep this from me.

14:15.455 --> 14:19.123
Think what I could do
with molecular manipulation.

14:19.125 --> 14:23.428
Turn the moon into
a green-energy battery.
Transmute jersey into...

14:24.096 --> 14:25.496
What's the opposite
of jersey?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.999
You see?
Okay, okay.
You were right.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.100
Once.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.169
Tony, we got
this handled.

14:31.171 --> 14:35.440
I wouldn't take
credit for this mess
if I was either of you.

14:36.108 --> 14:39.277
I would've at least
brought a hulk
or something.

14:40.412 --> 14:41.479
(sighs)

14:42.081 --> 14:43.982
You think I'm just
some weak kid?

14:43.984 --> 14:47.118
That wand gives me powers
even you avengers don't have!

14:48.053 --> 14:49.988
And you can never
make it work!

14:49.990 --> 14:51.389
Only me! Only...

14:53.058 --> 14:54.125
Both: I got it.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.227
No!

14:57.429 --> 14:59.631
Both: Which part
of your plan is this?

15:04.536 --> 15:07.138
I don't think
that's a good thing.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.207
(molecule kid yells)

15:10.576 --> 15:12.944
Help me? After what I've done?

15:13.312 --> 15:14.679
It's just what we do.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.215
We're not gonna outrun
this flash, kid.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.050
Say "cheese."
(molecule kid screams)

15:27.593 --> 15:29.093
Everything's gone.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.329
It's...
It's incredible.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.933
It's like reality is broken.
It can't lock in.

15:35.401 --> 15:38.136
But actually,
these are the building
blocks of the universe,

15:38.138 --> 15:39.938
And we can...
We can see them.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.475
(grunts) what happened?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.611
Breaking the wand
caused a rift.

15:47.012 --> 15:48.646
We got pulled through.

15:48.648 --> 15:51.716
We're looking at the world
on a molecular level.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.987
Nice. Great.
Can we go home now?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.357
Oh, right.

15:59.591 --> 16:01.592
Figures the only thing
my dad left for me

16:01.594 --> 16:03.661
Turns out to be
nothing but trouble.

16:04.330 --> 16:07.966
I thought I could do good,
clear his name, and now...

16:08.667 --> 16:10.535
And now
I've ruined everything!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.072
(sighs)

16:14.707 --> 16:16.541
You haven't
ruined everything.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.076
Not yet. (grunts)

16:24.249 --> 16:25.550
(sinister laughter)

16:28.554 --> 16:32.390
<i>This kind of power</i>
<i>belongs in my hands alone!</i>

16:44.636 --> 16:46.304
Captain america:
Tony, what is that?

16:46.306 --> 16:49.073
Iron man: Bad news.
That's a black hole.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.442
And there is no good news.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.611
M.O.D.O.K. Is adapting
the wand's powers,

16:53.613 --> 16:55.580
And he's about
to destroy this rift

16:55.582 --> 16:58.616
From the inside out,
us included.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.285
(sinister laughter)

17:02.788 --> 17:04.355
Avengers, assemble!

17:04.357 --> 17:06.557
Cap, falcon, get its arms.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.626
Widow, hawkeye, the legs.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.596
<i>I have nothing</i>
<i>to fear from you.</i>

17:12.431 --> 17:13.531
What about you?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.401
Me? I'm all heart.

17:19.171 --> 17:22.473
Modok:  <i>Your power</i>
<i>is nothing but feeding me.</i>

17:22.474 --> 17:24.474
<i>More. More!</i>

17:24.477 --> 17:26.644
(modok laughs wickedly)

17:30.215 --> 17:32.083
(straining)
need a better plan.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.823
Molecule kid: My wand
doesn't work on organic stuff.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.293
I'm guessing your suit isn't.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.598
<i>Oh! He destabilized</i>
<i>the suit's molecules!</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:49.400
<i>I can't adapt!</i>

17:50.602 --> 17:53.738
Kid, you may have
just bought us
some precious time.

17:54.139 --> 17:56.107
Uh, we have
a bigger problem.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.646
Falcon: If we blink
out of existence,

18:01.648 --> 18:03.748
Existence blinks
out of existence.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.350
Hawkeye: Deep.
Whatever that meant.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.618
We need you, aaron.

18:08.153 --> 18:10.555
You don't need me.
Nobody does.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.723
You just want this thing
my dad made,

18:12.858 --> 18:15.626
And as soon as you get it,
I'll be alone again.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.563
I thought
I could be different,
do something good with it,

18:18.565 --> 18:21.332
But I'm...
Just like my dad.

18:21.633 --> 18:24.635
Think so? Well,
here's where you
can turn that around.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.672
And you wielded
enough power to set
the world on its side.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.674
But it's likely that
you and you alone

18:29.676 --> 18:31.576
Can wield enough power
to set it back.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.345
Not with a stupid
broken power wand.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.815
If you have
the parts of something...

18:37.817 --> 18:40.184
...You can put it
back together.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.254
Like anyone would trust me
with that kind of power again.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.657
There may be no better hero
for this job, kid.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.459
Can you help us?

18:48.827 --> 18:50.661
Hero? Me?

18:51.663 --> 18:53.131
Tony...
How about now?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.700
Because adaptoid
is almost adapted.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.668
I'll try.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.776
I don't have enough power
to stop it from collapsing.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.245
I need help.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.147
This isn't just
about power, kid.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.682
That wand works
because you want it to work.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.652
I can give you
some extra juice,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.754
But you have to
fix it yourself.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.827
(straining)

19:25.297 --> 19:26.430
Huh?

19:32.571 --> 19:33.704
(laughs)

19:40.712 --> 19:41.946
(all straining)

19:44.349 --> 19:45.583
Hawkeye: Teamwork.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.353
<i>No!</i>

19:50.956 --> 19:52.456
<i>Ahhh! </i> (grunts)

19:59.398 --> 20:00.631
<i>Ahhh!</i>

20:01.533 --> 20:03.501
(yelling)

20:05.604 --> 20:07.538
All's well that ends well.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.209
Glad I could help,
especially since fury
didn't even want me here.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.880
Uh-oh. Hall monitor.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.683
I'm afraid this
is not quite over.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.452
You were not supposed
to be on this mission.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.255
And you were
supposed to make sure
he wasn't on this mission.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.723
Falcon: Ooh-hoo! Busted!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.959
You know, nicky,
you were right.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.796
The wand's power
is too tempting,
even for me.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.665
Secrets have a way
of getting out, fury.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.001
We should've
told our team,
trusted them.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.637
Us, we can
deal with later.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.473
Right now,
what do we do
with junior?

20:42.741 --> 20:46.277
Seems like he wants to
walk the path.

20:46.279 --> 20:49.614
Not exactly
avengers level yet,
but maybe,

20:49.616 --> 20:52.617
With a little encouragement?

20:52.619 --> 20:54.685
The son of a villain
is hero material?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.255
He is a bright
young man
with potential.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.358
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s got
a program training some
high school recruits.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.492
Right, nicky?

21:01.928 --> 21:07.398
Kid, you're lucky
to have recommendations
from the best of the best.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.499
Really?

21:09.401 --> 21:10.868
We'll discuss it over lunch
on the tricarrier.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.908
I have to congratulate you
for today, avengers.

21:18.477 --> 21:19.577
For keeping you
in the dark?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.612
For hiding
a mission from you?

21:21.614 --> 21:23.881
No. That I'm still
peeved about.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.952
But this kid may finally
have a chance at a future.

21:28.553 --> 21:33.424
Take it from me,
that's a real victory
for both of you.

21:34.526 --> 21:36.594
Thanks.
