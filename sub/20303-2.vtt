00:01.042 --> 00:03.545
NARRATOR:<i> In the last episode</i>
<i>of </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.628 --> 00:04.629
DAVENPORT: Miss Downey?

00:05.547 --> 00:07.799
Are you all right? Miss Downey?

00:08.717 --> 00:11.803
DOWNEY: This guy, uh, Lambert's been
coming in for a couple of weeks.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.348
The second I got in,
he offered me money to have sex with him.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.933
Do you think she's lying?

00:17.267 --> 00:18.893
I believe she believes
she's telling the truth.

00:18.977 --> 00:21.688
I also believe that's not necessarily
the same as the truth.

00:21.771 --> 00:25.066
-Sit down, hairbag.
-(gibbers)

00:27.736 --> 00:31.406
Item 15, regards one Jesse John Hudson.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.742
FURILLO: There's been a good deal
of anxiety up on the Hill of late.

00:34.075 --> 00:36.745
Word has it, you might want
to pick up where you left off.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.329
Let me assure you, Captain,

00:39.039 --> 00:40.373
I'm not your enemy.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.333
Hudson's taking over the Arrow again.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.711
Anyone that stands in his way
is a dead man.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.087
Had a few beers with a guy I met

00:46.171 --> 00:48.298
who runs the fish and tackle department
at Abernathy,

00:48.381 --> 00:49.507
-Luke MacAllister. Great guy.
-Mm.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.760
-Phil.
-Oh, hiya, Mac.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.219
Why so tense?

00:54.220 --> 00:56.056
Hey, what brings you up here?

00:56.139 --> 00:59.309
Well, nothing really, just a couple
of 50-yard-line red zone tickets

00:59.392 --> 01:00.435
for the Monday night game.

01:00.518 --> 01:04.314
Today, I'm feeling
I want a wife and a home.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.983
-Maybe even another kid--
-Please don't do this.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.861
Either we go forward or it's over.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.702
-(chattering)
-(laughing)

01:19.370 --> 01:20.789
ESTERHAUS: Item nine...

01:22.457 --> 01:23.708
Excuse me.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.503
Am I doing this for my health?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.632
-(room quiets)
-ESTERHAUS: All right then.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.428
Item nine, another driver
for the Top Hat Cab Company

01:35.512 --> 01:38.807
was hit last night
in the 1400 block of East Utica.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.934
That makes nine in the past two weeks,

01:41.559 --> 01:43.978
two of which involved serious injuries.

01:44.062 --> 01:47.607
Suspect is one medium-built Caucasian,
late 20s,

01:47.690 --> 01:51.861
sporting a smallish mustache, a .38 S&amp;W,

01:51.945 --> 01:54.280
and a rather large and inventive wardrobe,

01:54.364 --> 01:57.742
variously described by his victims
as among other things, a priest...

01:57.826 --> 02:00.078
-(laughter)
-...a male prostitute,

02:00.161 --> 02:03.623
a female prostitute,
and a young executive type.

02:04.082 --> 02:08.336
Belker, Yonke and Schmeltzer will continue
driving undercover for Top Hat

02:08.753 --> 02:10.964
until this trick-or-treater's put away,
but...

02:11.464 --> 02:13.967
-let's all keep our eyes peeled, shall we?
-(slurping)

02:14.050 --> 02:14.884
Baby!

02:16.928 --> 02:19.264
-Do you mind?
-(laughing)

02:21.474 --> 02:24.894
Item ten, Jack's Sporting Goods
was hit last night

02:24.978 --> 02:28.731
for over 200 firearms
and nearly 10,000 rounds of ammunition.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.691
(whistling)

02:29.774 --> 02:31.568
Now, for those of you
not easily impressed,

02:31.651 --> 02:35.113
that represents nearly twice the firepower
of the entire day shift.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.782
-MAN: I'm impressed.
-At this point it looks gang-related.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.703
Word on the street puts Jesse John Hudson
back in control of the Black Arrow,

02:41.786 --> 02:44.914
which... may or may not explain
that warlord of theirs

02:44.998 --> 02:47.125
found refrigerated
on Lennox Avenue two days ago.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.711
Either way,
there's a lot of fear out there,

02:49.794 --> 02:53.423
so, uh, let's be sensitized
to that situation.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.759
ESTERHAUS:
Well, what are we waitin' for? Let's roll.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.304
And, uh, let's be careful out there.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.223
(chattering resumes)

03:05.727 --> 03:06.811
ESTERHAUS: Hold it.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.232
We're gonna need crowd control
for a morgue job

03:11.316 --> 03:13.359
that just turned up
on East Ferry and Jefferson.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.779
Hill, Renko, Bates,

03:16.863 --> 03:19.657
Coffey, Lyle, Coley.

03:19.741 --> 03:23.536
No time for coffee. No time for doughnuts.

03:23.620 --> 03:27.165
No time for boys and girls.
No time for anything.

03:27.749 --> 03:32.003
From roll call to crowd control
in seconds flat.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.715
RENKO: Phillip Esterhaus knows
how I hate to miss my breakfast.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.551
Renko, if you got out of bed
half an hour earlier,

03:38.635 --> 03:40.553
-you could have breakfast at home.
-Renko.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.514
-I had a French toast and orange juice.
-So?

03:43.598 --> 03:46.643
I had two bowls of cornflakes,
and I ran three miles.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.104
(slurping)

03:50.188 --> 03:53.274
That's an interesting
evolutionary study there, isn't it?

03:53.983 --> 03:55.735
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Oh, now, wait a minute, Renko.

03:55.818 --> 03:58.279
-Your minute lasts an hour in there.
-Doggone it, Bobby.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.408
You know if I don't have my morning
sit down, I'll be in a foul mood all day!

04:02.492 --> 04:05.328
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:05.411 --> 04:07.121
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:07.205 --> 04:10.959
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:12.669
(sirens wailing)

04:18.132 --> 04:22.053
(theme music playing)

05:18.985 --> 05:21.321
I know this hasn't been easy for you,
Grace.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.448
Affairs aborted never are.

05:24.032 --> 05:27.452
I was up all night.
Was agonizing in the extremis.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.956
I've come to the conclusion
it's best if we separate.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.376
I need to reevaluate my life,
priority-wise.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.921
She hung up.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.554
Chin up, Phil.
It's a damn hard blow to the woman,

05:46.637 --> 05:47.805
but she'll recover.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.601
Heather? Who's Heather?

05:51.684 --> 05:54.228
She's a health freak I met
at my last double-A mixer.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.647
I'll tell you something, Neal,
it's truly a wonderful thing

05:56.731 --> 05:58.775
to be able to spend an entire evening
with a woman

05:58.858 --> 06:01.194
-without a bottle of booze for a backup.
-(laughs)

06:01.277 --> 06:03.863
-So what'd you two do all night, huh?
-You name it.

06:03.946 --> 06:07.200
Ginseng, mushrooms, some Jamaican.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.369
-Mm-hmm.
-A six-pack of some weird massage oil.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.329
The chick is a<i> Kama Sutra </i>on wheels, man.

06:11.412 --> 06:14.791
-We had the cats up till dawn.
-Oh, man.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.502
You know, you really give new meaning
to the word rehabilitated.

06:17.585 --> 06:19.837
Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.798
Come on, Frank, give me a shot.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.842
I mean, three undercover guys just
aren't enough, not for an 80-cab fleet.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.302
I don't think it's such a great idea,
Henry.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.887
This character's been known
to shoot people.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.430
So what am I, a dÃ©butante?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.517
You know, if Top Hat goes out of business,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.353
there's not gonna be one cab company
left within five miles of this precinct?

06:35.436 --> 06:39.148
-I'm aware of that, Henry.
-Then let me drive for a couple of days.

06:40.858 --> 06:43.319
(sighs)
I feel really strongly about this, Frank.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.987
I don't want to be a pencil pusher.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.075
Nobody's gonna take you for a cabbie
in those clothes.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.287
No, but they will with the outfit
I brought in this morning.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.419
-(horn honking)
-Did they get an I.D. on her yet?

06:59.502 --> 07:00.878
Nah, just one of the local streetwalkers.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.841
(all chattering)

07:04.924 --> 07:07.260
(police radio chatter)

07:07.343 --> 07:10.179
HILL: This doesn't have any sugar in it.
It's terrible.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.106
-Do you know her?
-Darlene Jean Montgomery.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.904
-Ring a bell?
-Yeah. Seen her around.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.699
-She's one of Billy the Monk's girls.
-Billy who?

07:29.782 --> 07:32.702
LARUE: Local pimp. His stable works
the strip for Fillmore.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.538
-Any money in there?
-Chump change.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.706
Looks like robbery then.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.791
Whatever it was she sure didn't go down
without a fight.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.836
Look at that, three broken nails,
scratch marks around the neck,

07:41.919 --> 07:45.173
torn blouse,
regular battle royal here last night.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.924
(honks horn)

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
-(police radio chatter)
-For you, dearest.

07:50.761 --> 07:51.846
Yeah, right, babe.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.603
Hey, Neal. Neal, come on.
You can do better than this.

07:58.686 --> 08:01.314
Hey, I got rent to pay.
I got a kid to support.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.775
Neal, we're talkin'
a murder investigation here.

08:04.859 --> 08:05.985
Talk to me, Freddy.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.822
If it's any good, I'll stick another zero
on the end of that. Okay?

08:11.365 --> 08:12.200
Now what you got?

08:15.077 --> 08:17.747
-Billy "The Monk" Allison.
-What about him?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.291
Well, uh, this morning about 5:00, uh,

08:20.374 --> 08:22.710
I went into Pimmy's for...
for a cup of coffee?

08:23.169 --> 08:26.088
Uh, you know, that hooker's hangout
over there on Franklin.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.673
That's when I saw him, man.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.426
He was, uh, gettin' out
of that big Lincoln of his,

08:30.510 --> 08:31.886
you know, with a couple
of his working girls?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.222
FREDDY: The dude must've been
in a brawl or somethin',

08:34.305 --> 08:36.807
'cause his suit was all messed up.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.352
The dude was definitely frosted
about somethin', 'cause,

08:39.435 --> 08:42.897
hey, man, he was slappin' and cussin'
those girls all the way to the front door.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.982
I paid you 20 bills for that?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.901
Damn it, Freddy,
that's not even worth 20 cents.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.570
-Man, you've got to do better than that.
-Hey, but, Neal, Neal, Neal!

08:49.654 --> 08:53.282
(stuttering) There was blood, man. I mean,
the dude's suit was covered with blood.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.078
(police radio chatter)

09:02.291 --> 09:04.126
Ain't no Billy the Monk in here.

09:04.752 --> 09:07.255
See this, sugar.
This is a warrant for his arrest.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.091
So you quit your messin', and open--
My-- Neal! My hand!

09:10.174 --> 09:12.385
-Hold it.
-Bobby! Bobby!

09:13.719 --> 09:16.430
-(clamoring)
-(screaming)

09:16.514 --> 09:18.808
-Come back!
-HILL: Renko, on the door! Get the door!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.143
(glass shattering)

09:24.480 --> 09:26.857
-You pig!
-Be nice! Be nice!

09:26.941 --> 09:32.822
White meat, fish belly, ground chump,
caramel-faced honky Oreo pig.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.783
Boy, they must've been freebasin' a storm
up there. Look at this stuff here.

09:35.866 --> 09:37.243
You know, you better
fix your commode there, man.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.995
Hey. Let's grab your coat, man.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.957
That's kid's stuff, man. I got that kind
of bail money in loose change.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.334
(chuckles) Yeah, sure you do, Billy.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.796
But it's the murder beef that's gonna
catch you short, my man.

09:56.721 --> 10:01.559
Community support and participation
is growing every day.

10:01.642 --> 10:06.522
In fact, we're having an exhibit
of Afro-American art here tonight,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.691
the proceeds of which will go toward

10:08.774 --> 10:12.153
helping establish
drug rehabilitation programs,

10:12.236 --> 10:15.531
remedial reading groups
and small business seminars.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.866
Who's paying the freight?

10:17.908 --> 10:22.705
Private donations, grants,
and local businesses

10:22.788 --> 10:25.499
-are contributing the dollars needed...
-(martial arts yells)

10:25.583 --> 10:30.296
...so that we in the community can assume
the task of educating our youth.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.966
-What are you educating them for, war?
-(yells continue)

10:34.634 --> 10:40.097
The martial arts teach discipline,

10:40.806 --> 10:42.600
without which there is no learning,

10:43.517 --> 10:46.312
and philosophy,
without which there is no purpose.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.813
How do you answer critics who charge

10:47.897 --> 10:49.982
that all you're doing
is exploiting the community,

10:50.066 --> 10:53.611
taking your cut off the top,
and then threatening strong-arm tactics

10:53.694 --> 10:55.988
against those who don't fall into line?

10:56.656 --> 11:00.201
-I can understand my critics' cynicism.
-(camera shutters clicking)

11:00.284 --> 11:03.996
-(piano music playing)
-(kids singing)

11:04.080 --> 11:05.498
But look at those kids.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.125
Now, tell me, are they cynical?

11:08.918 --> 11:11.379
I don't wanna take. I want to share!

11:11.962 --> 11:13.923
And I hope that one year from now,

11:14.006 --> 11:17.093
the impact of our programs
will speak for themselves.

11:17.176 --> 11:20.096
What about allegations that your return
had something to do

11:20.179 --> 11:22.056
with the death of Clayton Hicks?

11:22.473 --> 11:25.976
-Clayton was a warlord of the Black Arrow.
-(singing continues)

11:26.060 --> 11:29.313
He was a brother. I cared about him.
We loved him.

11:30.272 --> 11:34.360
Yet, I hope that his death
will someday teach us all

11:35.361 --> 11:37.947
that violence only begets violence.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.951
-What happened to Clayton Hicks?
-He got his throat cut

11:42.034 --> 11:43.536
for challenging the takeover.

11:44.078 --> 11:48.332
I also heard that it was Hudson
that had the dry cleaners on 124th torched

11:48.416 --> 11:49.625
as an example.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.629
(sighs) It's real tense up there.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.882
Guns, Virgil. What about guns?

11:59.343 --> 12:00.803
Uh. (exhales)

12:02.555 --> 12:05.182
Hudson's tight with a cadre
of Vietnam vets.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.059
They all did time together.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.770
The word has it that they were the ones
that hit that armory

12:09.854 --> 12:11.856
across the river two weeks ago,

12:12.565 --> 12:15.443
-and Jack's last night.
-Where do they keep the stuff?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.153
I'm not on that committee.

12:18.028 --> 12:21.657
Hey, but you don't keep that kinda arsenal
in the back of your car.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.618
Find out where they keep the guns.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.706
-I'm working on it.
-I know you are.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.543
Hey, listen, Belker.

12:33.502 --> 12:37.131
Treaties are comin' unstuck.
You can't cross the street anymore.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.300
Nobody's honoring the D.M.Z.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.013
The Black Arrow is damn
near up to brigade strength, man.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.098
-Blood is gonna run.
-When?

12:46.390 --> 12:49.101
Soon. Real soon.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.564
Virgil.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.691
What?

12:56.901 --> 13:00.154
Uh... (chuckles) Be careful.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.865
(laughs)

13:04.033 --> 13:06.410
Yeah. Yeah.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.750
(car door slams)

13:18.464 --> 13:19.340
(sighs)

13:31.185 --> 13:32.686
-You about through, Calloway?
-Near enough.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.772
-What do we have?
-Well, if this guy did her,

13:34.855 --> 13:37.149
he must've run himself through a car wash.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.901
If you have an eyewitness
to the main event,

13:38.984 --> 13:41.487
I suggest you bring him in.
You're gonna need him.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.491
-You wanted to see me, Frank?
-Uh, yeah, in my office.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.078
(speaking in Spanish)

13:51.121 --> 13:51.997
Frank?

13:52.373 --> 13:55.084
Ray, what say LaRue
and Washington bring in

13:55.167 --> 13:57.211
that witness of theirs, on the double.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.713
All right, Frank.

14:01.048 --> 14:03.050
-How's it going, Ben?
-Good, Ray.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.015
-(door closes)
-Ben, the other night

14:10.099 --> 14:12.351
you arrested a young woman, Susan Downey.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.603
She's a real cuckoo bird, Frank.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.107
She solicited me in the parking lot
of the Cat-O'-Nine-Tails,

14:18.524 --> 14:20.985
and when I I.D.'d myself, she went nuts.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.820
Called me every name in the book,

14:23.571 --> 14:25.447
scratched the skin off my neck, here.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.117
I mean, she was really wired.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.452
You charged her with everything
but the kitchen sink.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.707
All right, I admit she touched a nerve.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.502
But most of the charges are like chips
for the D.A.'s office,

14:38.586 --> 14:41.797
-so they'll have a position to deal from.
-There isn't gonna be a deal.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.049
The lady wants to take it to trial.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.803
She's leveled some pretty
serious charges against you.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.599
False arrest, assault, sexual harassment,
malfeasance.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.728
She claims you propositioned her
and threatened to arrest her

14:55.811 --> 14:58.814
-if she didn't comply.
-That's a bunch of nonsense, Frank.

14:59.440 --> 15:02.192
It was by the numbers, and I swear.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.573
I swear on my children.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.493
Okay, Ben. Thanks. That's all.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.045
Frank.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.923
Uh, Fay, I'm really pressed for time.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.175
-Is everything okay?
-Frank, I just need two minutes of it,

15:26.258 --> 15:28.135
the subject being alimony.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.512
-The check bounced.
-No, no, no, no.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.014
The check landed safely. Thank you.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.850
-Well, if you need extra money--
-No, no, no, Frank.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.478
What if I were to tell you
I need no more money?

15:37.561 --> 15:39.521
That you didn't have
to send alimony anymore?

15:39.605 --> 15:40.856
(laughs)

15:41.523 --> 15:44.860
Well, I'd say either a rich uncle died
or you're getting married.

15:45.402 --> 15:48.113
Since I'm more than passing familiar
with your side of the family,

15:48.197 --> 15:51.283
-you're getting married.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

15:51.742 --> 15:55.621
-Fay, a week ago you couldn't even--
-Hey, never mind.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.123
I mean, what is this?
I come in here bearing glad tidings,

15:58.207 --> 16:01.001
-and you're cracking lousy jokes.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

16:01.502 --> 16:03.420
-Who is he?
-His name is Hal Massey.

16:03.963 --> 16:09.510
He is a male Caucasian,
51 years old, divorced.

16:09.593 --> 16:10.970
He has two grown children,

16:11.303 --> 16:14.598
and he's running for reelection
to the school board in the ninth district.

16:14.682 --> 16:18.060
-Oh, how long have you known him?
-A week.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.896
That long. What about Frank Jr.?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.022
They love each other.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.984
I mean, Hal has convinced him
to go back to public school.

16:25.526 --> 16:29.947
And, Frank, we're talking
about starting another family.

16:31.907 --> 16:35.285
-Well, I'm not too old to bear children.
-Fay.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.788
(stammers) Don't you think this, uh,

16:37.871 --> 16:40.416
relationship should be allowed
to develop a little longer?

16:40.499 --> 16:43.711
How long does it take
a pot of water to boil?

16:44.878 --> 16:46.547
Frank, I came here for your blessing.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.426
-I mean, it means a lot to me.
-If you're happy, I'm happy.

16:50.968 --> 16:51.802
Thank you.

16:53.220 --> 16:56.098
Listen, I've got to run now, but
I'm gonna call you with all the details.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.268
Listen, please be sure this one is single.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.186
Ha-ha.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.442
-Hello, Fay.
-Hi, Doc. How are the kids?

17:06.525 --> 17:08.986
-Fine.
-You know, I was thinking about your boy.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.780
(gasps, cries out)

17:11.864 --> 17:13.991
-Oh!
-Baby. Baby, come back here.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.118
Oh! How dare you?

17:18.037 --> 17:19.747
You come outta there right now, mister,

17:19.830 --> 17:23.584
-or I'm comin' in there after you.
-(toilet flushes)

17:23.667 --> 17:25.002
-Fay?
-Howard.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.921
-(zipper zips)
-What a pleasant surprise.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.175
Howard, what kind of a zoo
are you people running here?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.802
There's a monkey in there with my purse!

17:34.303 --> 17:37.681
-(Baby snorting)
-Judas Priest.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.141
Step aside.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.896
All right, you simian psychopath.

17:43.979 --> 17:47.566
You're lookin' at three to five
the hard way if you don't open that door.

17:47.649 --> 17:49.109
(toilet flushes)

17:53.113 --> 17:55.824
(man shouting)
Hey! Hey! Hey, wait a minute.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.077
Hey, hey. Come here, mama.
You want to go to a little party?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.204
(stammers)
Hey, hold on now. What's wrong with you?

18:00.287 --> 18:03.999
-Come on now. Hold up.
-(horn honks)

18:04.083 --> 18:07.711
You wanna go to a little party?
Hey, come on, huh?

18:07.795 --> 18:11.298
It's just a little house party
around the corner here on Franklin.

18:11.381 --> 18:15.010
Fine wine, a little smoke,
and maybe something for your sinuses.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.386
Sorry I'm late, ma'am.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.264
Hey, we're havin' a conversation here,
chump.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.851
Come on, lady. I'm on a schedule.
Let's go. What do you say, huh?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.520
But I've only got bus fare.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.272
Twenty-buck red zone
is not the place to discuss it, lady.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.982
Come on. We'll settle it on the way.

18:32.694 --> 18:36.073
How 'bout giving us a ride, chuck meat?

18:36.782 --> 18:38.826
Why don't you do yourself a favor, Bruce?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.332
(pounds car body)

18:53.048 --> 18:54.716
No offense, ma'am, but...

18:55.050 --> 18:57.803
you ought to know better than to come
up here to do your shopping.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.140
(music playing)

19:05.185 --> 19:07.271
You gotta be in shape for these stairs.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.858
I guess you don't get a whole
lot of exercise drivin' a cab.

19:13.235 --> 19:16.113
To tell you the truth, ma'am,
I'm not really a cab driver.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.991
Oh, it-- Uh, it's okay. I'm a cop.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.243
Honest.

19:21.952 --> 19:22.786
(stammers) We're doing undercover.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.872
A lot of cab drivers
have been robbed lately.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.587
Look, I'll just put these bags down here,
'cause I've got to be going anyway.

19:32.379 --> 19:35.549
-Have you got some sort of identification?
-Oh, yeah.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.135
(music playing)

19:40.470 --> 19:42.472
-You are a cop.
-Yeah.

19:45.517 --> 19:49.646
Well, come on in then, uh, Henry.

19:57.070 --> 20:00.157
-(clears throat) Over there.
-(TV indistinct)

20:09.333 --> 20:12.419
Mama? You awake?

20:15.797 --> 20:17.424
(switches off TV)

20:23.722 --> 20:24.932
She's sleepin'.

20:28.977 --> 20:32.189
Well, I know it ain't much,
but it beats going back to Kentucky.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.024
How long you been up here?

20:34.900 --> 20:38.111
We came up here when my husband
lost his job at the paper mill.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.114
That was, um-- It was about two years ago.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.701
Donald figured he'd have a better chance
at one of the auto stampin' plants.

20:44.785 --> 20:45.869
Any luck?

20:46.662 --> 20:48.413
Hm? To tell you the truth,

20:49.206 --> 20:50.582
I don't exactly know.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.460
I haven't seen him in over a year.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.924
When Mama had her stroke,
we had to bring her up from home.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.761
We couldn't afford to put her
in a hospital or nothin',

21:02.844 --> 21:04.012
so we kept her with us.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.974
I guess Donald couldn't take it,

21:08.058 --> 21:11.228
so he, uh, upped and left.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.897
Doesn't sound like much of a life for you.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.109
I guess it could be worse.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.239
Can I get you something to drink?

21:22.322 --> 21:25.033
(stutters) I... I think I've got
a six-pack in here someplace.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.661
-No, that's okay. Really, I've got to go.
-Please.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.580
Well, don't rush off.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.000
You must be parched.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.878
Uh, well, uh,

21:37.796 --> 21:39.464
guess a glass of water would be nice.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.717
I should think,

21:42.217 --> 21:45.387
after luggin' 30 pounds
of groceries up those stairs.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.687
You know, you're the first guest
I've had up here in...

21:55.439 --> 21:56.732
more than a while.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.359
What with workin' and...

22:00.902 --> 22:02.112
and caring for Mama,

22:03.071 --> 22:06.116
I don't have exactly
what you'd call a hot social life.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.828
You're a very pretty woman. I'd think
you could get all the dates you wanted.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.246
-(glass shatters)
-Ah!

22:12.789 --> 22:13.790
Clumsy.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.670
Uh, you just stay put, Henry,
and I'll take care of this-- Ah!

22:19.796 --> 22:21.882
-Damn!
-Here, let me see that.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.059
(sobbing)

22:33.268 --> 22:34.144
Come on.

22:35.020 --> 22:35.854
It's all right.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.916
Hold me.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.256
Stay with me a while.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.968
I can't. I'm a married man.

23:10.013 --> 23:11.431
It doesn't matter.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.978
-Hey, I'm a very married man.
-(whimpering sob)

23:23.276 --> 23:24.277
(door closes)

23:35.247 --> 23:37.666
(bluesy rock playing)

23:45.465 --> 23:48.593
-What kind of games you playin', man?
-Eh--

23:49.177 --> 23:51.430
-What are you talking about, Neal?
-I just came from your house.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.473
Even the cockroaches moved out.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.059
Hey, man, I wasn't--

23:56.143 --> 23:59.062
I wasn't runnin' out on you.
Square biz, you know, I--

24:00.230 --> 24:04.317
Hey, look, I just moved some of my gear
over to my old lady's house.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.612
Kinda keepin' a low profile, you know?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.615
Hey, you can't be too careful
in my profession, right?

24:11.950 --> 24:15.537
What's wrong, Freddy?
You in some kind of jam, man?

24:16.580 --> 24:19.207
Uh, well, uh,

24:19.666 --> 24:21.751
I owe some money around town.

24:21.835 --> 24:25.130
Uh, two grand. (chuckles)

24:25.213 --> 24:27.799
-To some real arm benders.
-Two grand?

24:29.509 --> 24:31.803
You're shooting your life away
by the spoonful, Freddy.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.722
Oh, no! Oh, no, Neal.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.558
Oh, it's for my kid, Joey.

24:36.641 --> 24:39.686
Uh, he lives with his mom
over there on the west side.

24:40.854 --> 24:44.900
Hey, man, I'm sendin' him to baseball camp
out west this winter.

24:44.983 --> 24:48.028
-(laughs)
-You spent two grand on a baseball camp?

24:48.987 --> 24:52.866
Yeah. Hey, Neal.
Man, you don't get to the majors

24:52.949 --> 24:56.203
by playin' four months
a year in the snowbelt, man.

24:56.912 --> 24:58.705
Hey, hey, hey. Here.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.666
Take a look at that face, man.

25:03.960 --> 25:06.296
-Mm-hmm.
-You didn't think a guy like me

25:06.379 --> 25:08.048
could have a winner
like that for a kid, huh?

25:08.131 --> 25:09.633
Yeah. Something like that, man.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.345
-Joey.
-MAN: Hey, you got that sugar yet?

25:14.221 --> 25:15.931
Hey, uh, Neal.

25:16.598 --> 25:20.936
Uh, you get that $200
you promised me, man?

25:21.311 --> 25:22.812
You'll get it, Freddy.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.066
Soon as you tell that story of yours down
at the stationhouse.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.901
-Now let's get goin'.
-Uh, Neal.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.740
Uh, hey, man, I need it now.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.285
I mean, like, uh-- (stutters)
Hey, I'm two weeks behind

25:37.369 --> 25:39.621
on the juice to these guys as it is.

25:39.704 --> 25:43.250
If I don't come up with some bread today,
I'm dead in this neighborhood, man.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.921
Hey, uh-- I'm gonna be dead period.
(chuckles)

25:48.004 --> 25:49.089
Please?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.342
How do I know you'll show up?

25:52.968 --> 25:55.554
(chuckles) Hey, Neal. You know me, man.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.347
Hell, have I ever let you down yet?

25:57.806 --> 26:01.017
Hey, I swear. I'll show.
(stutters) I swear on my kid.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.942
Tell you something, man.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.112
You best be there.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.283
-Six o'clock.
-Oh, I'll be there.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.451
Hey. Thanks.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.004
-Any luck?
-He's hanging out in Pimmy's.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.089
-So is he comin' or what?
-Yeah, later on.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.466
I gave him a couple of hours to take care
of some business.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.093
I hope that's all you gave him.

26:35.176 --> 26:37.512
-(sighs)
-Aw, man, don't tell me

26:37.596 --> 26:39.389
you let him weasel you out of more bucks.

26:39.472 --> 26:42.892
He's gettin' hinky, babe.
He would've clammed up on us if I didn't.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.270
But he promised to meet us
at the station around 6:00.

26:45.353 --> 26:48.857
-You think he's gonna keep that date?
-Yeah, you bet I do, lover.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.775
'Cause you're gonna be tailing him
in the meantime.

26:53.653 --> 26:55.572
Margaret, you don't have to go
to all that trouble.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.699
I enjoy putting up the storm windows.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.618
MARGARET:<i> But I made you meat loaf</i>
<i>and mashed potatoes.</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:01.703
Meat loaf and mashed potatoes?

27:01.786 --> 27:04.372
<i>-Stove Top dressing...</i>
-Stove Top dressing.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.166
<i>-...and peach cobbler.</i>
-Peach cobbler.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.378
(stutters) I didn't think you remembered.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.386
Margaret, I'm gonna have to call you back.

27:34.944 --> 27:37.697
(stammers)
It's not that I don't love you, Grace.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.241
It's just I have these other needs.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.911
Meat loaf and peach cobbler,
to name a few.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.623
Isn't it telling,
the memories that linger?

27:47.749 --> 27:50.043
I found these while cleaning
the front hall closet.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.546
Can't this wait
for a more appropriate time?

27:53.630 --> 27:57.008
I have waited, Phil. And I have endured.

27:57.550 --> 28:01.221
First, your Gidget phase
with that post-pubescent pom-pom girl.

28:01.304 --> 28:04.683
And now the second coming of Margaret,
your Tupperware Madonna.

28:04.766 --> 28:09.646
I'm going to be 40 in May, Phil,
and I have wasted enough time as it is.

28:09.729 --> 28:13.024
Well, I wouldn't necessarily call
what we had a waste of time.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.985
Oh, it was fun while it lasted,

28:16.069 --> 28:20.490
but I am not about a couple of gimlets
and a roll on a rug.

28:20.573 --> 28:23.493
There are frontiers out there
to be explored, Phil.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.831
Entire continents of sensual stimuli.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.709
And if I have to make that journey alone,

28:31.126 --> 28:35.880
I prefer to do so without a lot of excess
sentimental baggage.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.260
Oh, my D.H. Lawrence anthology.

28:40.844 --> 28:45.181
Ooh, our photos
of the Garden of Eden retreat.

28:45.265 --> 28:47.809
Don't worry, darling,
I burned the negatives.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.271
I just want to give you some idea of what
you're going to be missing

28:51.354 --> 28:54.399
when I walk up those stairs
and out the door.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.360
Well, you don't have to give back
my Havelock Ellis.

28:57.444 --> 29:01.448
Kiss it all goodbye, Phil.
The midnight loofah lessons,

29:01.823 --> 29:05.785
the omelets<i> au naturel</i>,
the pagan campouts.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.663
Grace, why are you
making this so difficult?

29:09.289 --> 29:12.792
Can't we act like civilized human beings?

29:13.585 --> 29:15.128
Among other things,

29:15.670 --> 29:18.339
I have left you
the mai tai-flavored body rub.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.219
Margaret should get
a big bang out of that.

29:25.805 --> 29:29.726
-(phones ringing)
-(radio chatter)

29:36.232 --> 29:39.903
Leapin' lizards, Grace Gardner.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.279
-Hello, Howard.
-(chuckles)

29:44.991 --> 29:46.534
<i>Quel </i>surprise, uh.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.163
Uh, you look radiant.

29:54.209 --> 29:58.004
Thank you. You're looking
quite<i> distinguÃ© </i>yourself.

29:58.087 --> 30:00.924
(laughs) Well, it's the uniform.

30:01.966 --> 30:05.595
I modified a design from the Copenhagen
National Anti-Terrorist Group.

30:05.678 --> 30:09.599
The, uh, lateral map pocket
is wholly my own idea.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.729
Needs a little Zipease. (chuckles)

30:17.065 --> 30:18.149
(sighs)

30:30.203 --> 30:32.330
Is there something more
you want to say, Howard?

30:33.581 --> 30:37.126
Well, it's rather hard
at the moment, Grace, uh,

30:38.837 --> 30:41.214
uh, to express my intentions, that is.

30:41.297 --> 30:45.552
Uh, I mean,<i> vis-Ã -vis</i>
your current situation,

30:45.635 --> 30:47.595
uh,<i> vis-Ã -vis </i>Phil Esterhaus,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.890
who happens to be one of my closest
friends, now make no mistake.

30:51.349 --> 30:55.812
But, uh, I just couldn't help but wonder,
uh, that is--

30:57.772 --> 31:00.358
Well, if no one is tying you up tonight,

31:01.609 --> 31:02.652
as it were--

31:05.154 --> 31:10.952
Uh, if you would like to go
to an absolutely top-drawer

31:11.703 --> 31:14.414
art exhibit at St. Mary's tonight?

31:20.420 --> 31:22.255
Are you trying to ask me
for a date, Howard?

31:23.965 --> 31:24.883
Well...

31:26.342 --> 31:29.178
to put it bluntly, uh, yes.

31:44.402 --> 31:45.403
(expels deep breath)

31:47.989 --> 31:49.908
Shall we say eight-ish?

31:51.326 --> 31:53.578
Oh, don't look so astonished, Howard.

31:53.661 --> 31:59.042
It's not every day I get invited
to an evening of Afro-American art.

32:13.681 --> 32:14.766
(grunting sigh)

32:21.147 --> 32:24.317
-Hey, Phil.
-Oh, hiya, Mac.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.486
Hey, uh, why the long face, huh?

32:26.569 --> 32:29.322
Oh, I don't know.
It's been kind of a rough week.

32:29.405 --> 32:30.531
(sniffs)

32:30.615 --> 32:33.117
Anything that a weekend
of fishin' wouldn't cure?

32:33.701 --> 32:34.786
Oh, you got the cabin?

32:34.869 --> 32:37.413
Two dynamite days on
the shores of Lake Lackawanna,

32:37.497 --> 32:39.624
-a private pier, nothing to worry about...
-(toilet flushing)

32:39.707 --> 32:41.501
...except how many bass
we reel in for breakfast.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.461
-Yeah!
-Sarge!

32:43.878 --> 32:46.130
Have you got a cabin at Lake Lackawanna?

32:47.507 --> 32:49.759
You know, I've been dying
to get up there all season.

32:49.842 --> 32:51.302
-Mac, this is Andy Renko.
-Yeah, I--

32:51.386 --> 32:53.012
-Luke MacAllister.
-Yeah, nice to--

32:53.096 --> 32:55.473
You know, the broker says it sleeps four,
but what the hell.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.266
Sir Renko, what are you gonna do,
set up shop in there? Let's go!

32:57.350 --> 32:59.978
Would you just relax for a minute?
I am here talkin' to Mac,

33:00.061 --> 33:02.981
who has just informed me
that he has a monster cabin

33:03.064 --> 33:04.941
at Lake Lackawanna for the weekend.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.734
-Well, it's not--
-Oh, yeah? Mac, Bobby Hill.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.695
-Hiya, Bobby.
-You sure you got enough room up there?

33:08.778 --> 33:09.612
That's a generous offer.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.782
He says that it sleeps
almost a half a dozen people.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.158
What do you want, the Hotel Carlyle?

33:14.242 --> 33:17.245
I mean, you guys, it's just, you know,
it's a one-room cabin, that's all.

33:17.328 --> 33:20.665
That's terrific. You know what?
I have been dyin' to go fishin'.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.417
-I haven't been fishin' in over two years.
-That's great.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.293
-HILL: Hey, Joe! Joe Coffey!
-Hey, Bobby, wait.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.587
-Come here, Joe Coffey!
-Joe, listen to this in here now.

33:26.671 --> 33:31.217
Joe, listen to this. You know what?
We have us a cabin up at...

33:31.300 --> 33:34.595
RENKO, HILL: Lake Lackawanna, baby!

33:34.679 --> 33:36.639
-No kiddin'?
-Say, Mac. This is Joe Coffey.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.307
-How ya doin'? That's great!
-Hi, Joe.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.477
-You going too, Sarge?
-Oh, no. I doubt it.

33:42.687 --> 33:46.065
Hey, uh, look, we don't wanna bust up
your weekend or anything.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.235
Oh, no, no, no. I had more
of a quiet weekend at home in mind.

33:49.318 --> 33:52.196
But, uh, hey, you guys
have a ball up there, huh?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.365
-All right!
-Hey, Phil--

33:54.449 --> 33:57.452
Mac, old buddy,
I have one thing to ask you.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.037
-What's that?
-Do you have a rod

33:59.120 --> 34:00.496
and a reel I can borrow?

34:01.789 --> 34:04.292
-Sure, Andy.
-God bless you!

34:04.375 --> 34:06.836
RENKO, HILL: All right. Lake Lackawanna!

34:06.919 --> 34:09.630
(chattering, laughing)

34:10.715 --> 34:11.674
(sighs)

34:13.426 --> 34:15.219
-(footsteps)
-(chuckling)

34:21.017 --> 34:23.436
-(door closes)
-MAN'S VOICE: Broadway and Dekker, honey,

34:23.519 --> 34:26.522
-through the park.
-I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm on my lunch break.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.109
How'd you like to have
your brains for lunch?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.197
Drive.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.995
(engine starts)

34:49.420 --> 34:51.380
-Why don't you lower the gun?
-Shut up!

35:07.605 --> 35:10.900
Don't move. Don't even breathe fast,

35:10.983 --> 35:12.902
or I'll re-upholster
this heap with your face.

35:20.368 --> 35:21.536
Make a right.

35:23.037 --> 35:25.289
Come on, move it, you little shrimp.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.668
All right, you want to play guts,
we'll play guts!

35:28.751 --> 35:32.380
-(car accelerating)
-(tires screeching)

35:32.463 --> 35:35.133
(horn honking)

35:42.557 --> 35:45.059
-Hey, come on!
-What's the matter, hairball?

35:45.143 --> 35:46.811
Your pantyhose on too tight?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.285
(Belker growling)

36:07.039 --> 36:09.750
(cross-dresser grunts, whimpers)

36:09.834 --> 36:12.962
You forgot to pay your fare, dogbreath!

36:14.338 --> 36:16.465
Yeah. Uh-huh.

36:17.216 --> 36:18.384
North or south?

36:19.093 --> 36:21.804
Okay, you hang tight,
I'll be back to you in two minutes.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.473
Yeah. Captain.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.685
Captain, I need a couple of warrants.

36:27.768 --> 36:29.562
Virgil just came up
with a warehouse address

36:29.645 --> 36:32.815
that may tie in with that, uh,
stolen armory hardware.

36:32.899 --> 36:34.775
Judge Raboski's sitting today.
I'll call 'em in.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.485
-You go down and pick 'em up.
-Okay.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.280
Tell Phil to give you a backup,
but be careful, Mick.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.450
It took us ten months to wire Virgil
into the Black Arrow.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.743
I don't want to lose him now.

36:44.535 --> 36:48.331
And, Mick, great collar
on that cabbie situation.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.750
Thank you, Captain.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.877
(snorting)

37:03.179 --> 37:05.056
(snorting)

37:05.139 --> 37:08.643
No, you can't come along, hairbag.
You gotta stay here.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.978
Assume the position, hairbag.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.650
(snorting)

37:16.859 --> 37:20.154
-(phone rings)
-Detective Washington.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.448
LARUE:
<i>Neal, I'm at the train station, man.</i>

37:22.531 --> 37:24.951
<i>Freddy's waiting on the L.A. Flyer,</i>
<i>and he's got his kid with him.</i>

37:25.034 --> 37:27.036
-Damn!
<i>-Platform 12.</i>

37:27.119 --> 37:28.079
I'm on my way.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.924
Captain.

37:41.342 --> 37:44.011
-Surprised to see you here.
-Are you?

37:44.470 --> 37:45.846
I don't know why you would be,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.724
given our mutual interest
in community relations.

37:48.808 --> 37:52.937
My attorney, Samantha McBride.
Captain Frank Furillo.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.815
How do you do? I've heard the name.

37:55.898 --> 37:59.068
-You have a very impressive reputation.
-Thank you, Captain.

37:59.610 --> 38:04.031
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna check out your wall art here.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.908
-Appreciate you coming, Captain.
-Mm-hmm.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.327
-Nice to meet you.
-Mm.

38:11.831 --> 38:15.084
GRACE: Such brute, atavistic passion.

38:16.002 --> 38:18.504
Such third world primevalism.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.509
Perspective's identical to a project sweep
from a C-40 chopper.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.805
(pants) It stirs something deep within me.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.308
All night maneuvers have that effect.

38:41.610 --> 38:44.322
-What do you think of it?
-It's interesting.

38:44.947 --> 38:45.948
Interesting?

38:46.324 --> 38:50.453
Isn't that a polite way of saying
it's a terrible waste of wall space?

38:52.955 --> 38:57.960
-Yes, I suppose it is. I'm Frank Furillo.
-Adrianna Furth.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.338
-Furth Gallery?
-Mm-hmm.

39:01.172 --> 39:03.049
I've been in there a number of times.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.051
Which is a polite way of saying

39:05.134 --> 39:07.386
I'd take your wall space
over this any day.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.680
Thank you.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.850
You know, Phil and I
are no longer together.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.687
Well, uh, yes.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.482
Do you know why?

39:21.692 --> 39:22.818
Not exactly.

39:28.157 --> 39:30.451
Because he couldn't handle my needs.

39:31.660 --> 39:32.995
My desires.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.207
Do you understand what I'm saying?

39:37.792 --> 39:38.876
Yes.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.420
I think so.

39:42.922 --> 39:43.964
Do you want me?

39:45.299 --> 39:46.884
(voice breaks) Yes. (clears throat)

39:53.808 --> 39:55.226
Your place or mine?

39:57.144 --> 39:57.978
Mine.

40:00.856 --> 40:05.861
I have some coconut rum lotion
I am dying to try out.

40:17.164 --> 40:19.583
-It's not exactly...
-(laughs)

40:19.667 --> 40:22.878
-Hello, Frank.
-Joyce.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.005
-How are you?
-Couldn't be better. You?

40:25.089 --> 40:28.801
Wonderful.
Meet Lance Pollack. Frank Furillo.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.553
-How do you do, Frank?
-How are you?

40:30.636 --> 40:33.556
This is my friend, Adrianna Furth.
Joyce Davenport, Lance.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.974
-JOYCE: How do you do?
-Hello.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.184
-Hi.
-ADRIANNA: Hello.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.396
-I've bought some things at your gallery.
-Oh, I hope you enjoyed them.

40:40.479 --> 40:41.856
-Very much.
-MAN: Joyce?

40:42.648 --> 40:46.902
-Where have you been?
-Out of circulation, but I'm back.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.737
Good. I'll call you.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.200
Always the popular one, counselor.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.619
I'm at liberty to be so these days.

40:57.037 --> 40:59.832
Well, nice to see you, Frank. Ms. Furth.

41:08.215 --> 41:09.508
How fresh is the wound?

41:11.260 --> 41:13.929
(chuckles) Still bleeding.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.765
It was nice meeting you, Frank.
Best of luck.

41:16.849 --> 41:18.809
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology.

41:18.893 --> 41:21.645
-You don't owe me a thing.
-Could we have dinner?

41:22.688 --> 41:24.815
-Feel free to call me.
-I meant tonight.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.902
I think any other night but...

41:38.913 --> 41:41.123
(no audible dialogue)

42:26.252 --> 42:27.336
MAN: Belker.

42:43.018 --> 42:44.228
Bingo.

42:44.937 --> 42:48.440
WOMAN (on P.A.):<i> California Flyer</i>
<i>is now boarding on Platform 12.</i>

42:48.524 --> 42:53.279
-Hey, you goin' somewhere, Freddy?
-Oh! Hey. Hi, fellas, uh--

42:53.362 --> 42:55.614
Hey, I know what this looks like,
but, uh...

42:56.407 --> 42:58.200
Uh, let me explain, okay?

42:58.617 --> 43:01.620
Fine, this is Joey, my kid, Joey.

43:02.871 --> 43:05.165
Hey, Joey, I want you to meet
a couple of real stand-up guys.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.876
This is... This is Neal and, uh, J.D.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.255
-Hey, you stiffed me, Freddy.
-No, man. No, no.

43:11.338 --> 43:14.049
I was just puttin' Joey on the train
to that camp out west,

43:14.133 --> 43:16.885
just like I told you, and then I was
coming right over to see you guys.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.096
-(stutters) I swear to God.
-Assume the position, Freddy.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.223
-Aw, come on.
-Assume it, man!

43:22.266 --> 43:24.727
Coming right over, right? Yeah.

43:24.810 --> 43:28.522
-Oh, man, look it here! Look it there!
-Oh, my.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.150
Oh, you must've been
workin' overtime, my man.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.360
Uh-oh, look at here, J.D.

43:34.445 --> 43:37.114
-Two train tickets to L.A.
-Neal--

43:37.197 --> 43:39.533
Look at this, man.
There's blood on some of these bills.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.328
Hey, come on. Not in front of my kid,
please, have some consideration.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.330
You did it, man, didn't you?
You killed her.

43:44.413 --> 43:47.499
You got it all wrong, man.
She owed me money.

43:47.583 --> 43:50.377
And when I asked her for it,
she pulled a knife on me.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.838
I mean, what was I gonna do?
Neal, I mean--

43:52.921 --> 43:55.841
-You have the right to remain silent--
-I know my rights, man!

43:55.924 --> 43:56.759
WASHINGTON: Anything you say can

43:56.842 --> 43:58.093
-and will be held against you.
-J.D., please.

43:58.177 --> 44:01.430
No, cuffs, no cuffs.
Not in front of Joey, please.

44:01.513 --> 44:02.806
-I'm beggin' you.
-Yeah, okay.

44:04.558 --> 44:07.645
Hey, hey, look it, Ace. Uh, look, uh--

44:08.187 --> 44:09.730
(stutters) Somethin' just come up, okay?

44:09.813 --> 44:12.941
(stutters) And I gotta do something
real important with these guys.

44:13.025 --> 44:17.738
So, uh, uh, we're gonna take you
over to your mom's, right?

44:18.489 --> 44:20.866
-Yeah, yeah, right.
-Right. And, uh,

44:20.949 --> 44:23.869
you don't need to say anything
about this little trip, 'cause, uh,

44:24.370 --> 44:26.372
you know your mom,
she wouldn't understand.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.209
And we don't wanna upset her, right?

44:31.293 --> 44:33.545
(voice breaking) Attaboy. I love you.

44:33.629 --> 44:36.465
(weeping) Oh, God. I love you.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.863
Nice going, Mick. How's Virgil?

45:00.239 --> 45:03.867
Uh, I don't know. He took off
before I called in the impound guys.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.912
We're trying to find a paper trail
to Jesse John Hudson.

45:06.995 --> 45:08.330
-Don't hold your breath.
-Mm.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.874
-Frank, you got a few minutes?
-Oh, yeah, Henry.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.960
Uh, let me just get a cup of coffee first.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.963
(typing)

45:16.046 --> 45:18.215
-Is that our nail?
-Yeah.

45:18.298 --> 45:20.467
Guy's a real slimebag, Henry.

45:20.843 --> 45:24.722
Carves up a hooker for 200 bucks,
then he beats Neal for two,

45:25.055 --> 45:28.225
then he steals his kid
from his ex-old lady to go to L.A.

45:29.643 --> 45:32.396
(sighs) Snitches, man.

45:32.938 --> 45:36.900
They walk and talk like us,
but they ain't like us.

45:36.984 --> 45:41.363
-No, sir. You're talking animal life.
-We create 'em, J.D.

45:42.281 --> 45:46.076
Standard procedure, that's all.
Take a loser and make him an outcast.

45:46.160 --> 45:49.163
Give him money, drugs, buddy routine,
whatever it takes.

45:50.122 --> 45:51.832
We take desperate people
and make 'em more desperate.

45:51.915 --> 45:55.294
Henry, huh?
You're bleedin' all over my arrest report.

45:56.253 --> 45:59.256
Nothing like that
has ever happened to me before.

46:00.966 --> 46:04.261
To tell the truth, I think I wanted her
as much as she wanted me.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.096
I mean, how do you handle
something like that?

46:06.889 --> 46:08.474
(chuckles)

46:10.309 --> 46:12.936
-I wish I knew, Henry.
-I'm no ladies' man, Frank.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.439
I had to make four phone calls
just to get a prom date.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.734
I'm not used to women coming on to me.

46:19.276 --> 46:22.613
In 11 years of marriage,
I never once been unfaithful to Rachel.

46:22.696 --> 46:23.947
I thought about it now and then.

46:24.031 --> 46:27.117
I mean, we're in the middle
of a sexual revolution here, aren't we?

46:27.201 --> 46:28.452
I love my wife.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.330
But a little change of menu...

46:35.250 --> 46:37.377
This woman is so nice.

46:38.962 --> 46:40.923
She really wants me, Frank.
What's the harm?

46:42.966 --> 46:47.054
Well, you'd be opening yourself up
to a lot of complications.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.432
You don't get something for nothing.

47:01.735 --> 47:04.655
I guess you're right. I just had to hear
somebody else say it.

47:06.073 --> 47:07.449
Besides, I'm such a chicken.

47:08.575 --> 47:10.786
I don't think I could do it
and look Rachel in the eye.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.413
Well, good night, Frank.

47:13.956 --> 47:14.832
Good night, Henry.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.751
Take it easy.

47:18.710 --> 47:19.670
Yeah.

47:38.647 --> 47:39.648
WOMAN: Who's there?

47:41.692 --> 47:43.986
-Henry Goldblume.
-(lock clicking)

47:48.949 --> 47:49.783
Hi.

47:50.909 --> 47:51.952
Hi.

47:55.747 --> 47:56.999
Do you mind if I come in?

48:00.168 --> 48:01.503
I wish you would.

48:22.524 --> 48:25.527
(closing theme playing)
