<i>Previously on</i> Doom Patrol...

00:22.559 --> 00:25.129
You told me
I could say goodbye!

00:25.163 --> 00:26.763
Chief!

00:26.797 --> 00:27.930
What in the hell...

00:27.931 --> 00:29.299
Cliff's having
a psychotic break.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.902
I'm so angry!

00:31.937 --> 00:35.340
Maybe Larry's not a hero.
But that thing inside him is.

00:35.371 --> 00:39.643
Captain Trainor, once a
soldier, always a soldier.

00:41.045 --> 00:42.346
What is this?

00:42.347 --> 00:44.380
It's what Mr. Nobody
showed me in the donkey.

00:44.381 --> 00:46.618
- You made this up.
- Who are you?

00:46.651 --> 00:49.688
I'm the only one
here who can stand you.

00:49.719 --> 00:52.755
Jane, don't leave. There's
nowhere to go from here but up.

00:52.756 --> 00:55.189
Jane, I'm sorry.

02:47.372 --> 02:50.182
<i>Agent Wilson, the second
we get your signal, we're coming in hot.</i>

02:50.206 --> 02:54.812
You got your ticket to the freak show?

02:54.843 --> 02:57.714
Yeah.

02:57.715 --> 02:58.715
Good to go.

02:58.716 --> 03:00.682
Don't catch anything.

03:02.551 --> 03:04.388
You got this, Morris.

03:04.420 --> 03:08.170
<i>Let's tear it up.</i>

03:49.366 --> 03:52.002
He's new.

03:52.036 --> 03:55.186
Who's the new hottie?

04:14.758 --> 04:16.190
<i>How bad it is, Agent?</i>

04:16.192 --> 04:19.062
<i>Abnormal to a factor of what?</i>

04:19.096 --> 04:22.199
Stand by.

04:29.406 --> 04:30.841
<i>Talk to me, Morris.</i>

04:30.875 --> 04:35.875
Agent Wilson, what's your 20?

04:41.218 --> 04:43.321
Agent Wilson?

04:43.353 --> 04:45.302
Agent Wilson!

04:48.692 --> 04:51.843
Go, go, go!
Let's go!

04:56.500 --> 04:59.201
God damn it! Fuck!

05:21.860 --> 05:26.628
You ever get a
rat stuck in you before?

05:26.629 --> 05:28.932
- No.
- Do I smell?

05:28.966 --> 05:31.411
- I'm worried I smell, and no one's telling me.
- You don't smell.

05:31.435 --> 05:33.514
'Cause who the hell knows
what that frigging thing was doing

05:33.538 --> 05:36.107
while it was inside me.

05:36.141 --> 05:39.343
I just rewired your circuits and patched
up your nutrient tank. You're fine.

05:39.377 --> 05:41.378
Shouldn't we at least just
spray a little Lysol in here,

05:41.379 --> 05:43.014
maybe, you know,
hang an air freshener.

05:43.048 --> 05:47.384
- Maybe you could light a candle...
- Cliff!

05:47.418 --> 05:48.985
You think Jane's okay?

05:49.019 --> 05:50.721
She's Jane. She's fine.

05:50.754 --> 05:52.622
I gotta make
things right with her.

05:52.656 --> 05:54.158
Okay, help me out here.

05:54.192 --> 05:56.896
What part of her telling you
to F off last night, didn't land?

05:56.927 --> 06:01.232
Hey, remember when you thought not cursing
would get you into the Justice League?

06:01.264 --> 06:03.334
What's up your ass?

06:03.367 --> 06:07.204
Oh, is it 'cause of Jane's
psycho killer painting of you,

06:07.237 --> 06:08.673
where you killed us all?

06:08.706 --> 06:10.608
- Shut up, Cliff.
- Yeah, that sucked.

06:10.641 --> 06:13.881
If you're feeling any homicidal urges, just
gives us a little heads up, all right?

06:13.911 --> 06:15.544
I said, shut up.

06:17.658 --> 06:21.165
I'm gonna come for you.

06:38.535 --> 06:41.937
Sir, he's awake.

06:41.971 --> 06:43.872
What's going on?

06:43.906 --> 06:45.276
Where am I?

06:45.310 --> 06:48.980
Welcome to your new
base of operations, Captain Trainor.

06:49.012 --> 06:51.281
I'm Agent Charles Forsythe,
DOD.

06:51.314 --> 06:53.181
DOD?

06:53.182 --> 06:53.762
Why are you...

06:53.763 --> 06:56.886
You and I are going to accomplish
great things together, Captain.

06:56.887 --> 07:00.925
The radioactive energy
within you is formidable.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.959
We're gonna see if we can
find a way to harness it.

07:02.994 --> 07:06.163
What the hell are you talking about?
I never agreed to any of this.

07:06.197 --> 07:09.432
I'm afraid this
isn't negotiable, soldier.

07:09.466 --> 07:14.466
- Your service is compulsory.
- Compulsory?

07:18.807 --> 07:21.144
Hey! Hey!

07:34.324 --> 07:35.324
Jesus.

08:12.196 --> 08:15.064
<i>Hey,
The Chief's still missing.</i>

08:15.098 --> 08:18.836
<i>If you have any useful
information, leave it here.</i>

08:18.869 --> 08:21.637
<i>If you don't, why the fuck
are you wasting my time?</i>

08:21.672 --> 08:24.274
<i>Hey, guys, it's me.</i>

08:24.307 --> 08:29.045
<i>Hope you're all doing okay. Rita, if you
get this, I have cute little thing...</i>

08:29.079 --> 08:32.816
Jane, hey, I'm glad you called.

08:32.850 --> 08:38.421
Uh, I'm really sorry about
what I said last night.

08:38.422 --> 08:41.389
That wasn't me.

08:41.423 --> 08:43.894
I had a rat in my head.

08:43.927 --> 08:48.065
It's okay. I get it. We all have
rats in our heads sometimes.

08:48.099 --> 08:52.436
- Yeah. so, are we good?
- Oh, my God, totally.

08:52.469 --> 08:54.538
It's cool beans.

08:54.571 --> 08:56.538
Are you gonna
come home?

08:56.572 --> 09:00.644
Hmm, wait. I'm sorry.
Who is this?

09:00.677 --> 09:04.581
- Cliff.
<i>- Oh, right, right! Hi, Cliff.</i>

09:04.615 --> 09:06.250
<i>Listen, I gotta jam, okay?</i>

09:06.283 --> 09:09.284
Just let Rita know I'm having
a little thing tonight at Doug's place,

09:09.317 --> 09:10.620
and I hope she can make it.

09:10.653 --> 09:12.187
<i>It'll be super chill.</i>

09:12.221 --> 09:17.221
- Whose place?
- Thanks so much, Cliffie. Heart you.

09:21.966 --> 09:24.567
- Is she okay?
- I think.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.571
She said everything was...

09:27.604 --> 09:30.605
- "cool beans."
- "Cool beans"?

09:30.639 --> 09:33.744
- Oh, God.
- What?

09:33.777 --> 09:37.346
Whenever Jane is feeling
particularly low,

09:37.379 --> 09:39.615
this one persona manifests

09:39.649 --> 09:44.552
and runs off to some ridiculous
fantasy life she's created for herself.

09:44.586 --> 09:47.524
She's by far the worst
of the 64.

09:47.557 --> 09:49.926
Who?

09:49.957 --> 09:51.696
Karen.

09:51.729 --> 09:56.729
<i>She's a love-struck psycho, stunted by her
obsession with rom-coms from the '90s.</i>

09:56.865 --> 09:59.403
<i>If I had to guess,
I'd say she's on her way back</i>

09:59.436 --> 10:01.205
<i>to her leading man right now.</i>

10:01.239 --> 10:03.774
<i>Some milquetoast layabout
named Doug.</i>

10:03.807 --> 10:06.176
Go get 'em, girl.

10:09.346 --> 10:11.980
<i>She's broken up
with him about 1,000 times.</i>

10:12.014 --> 10:15.586
But somehow, she always manages
<i>to win him back.</i>

10:15.619 --> 10:20.619
Stand under here
if you'd like.

10:20.856 --> 10:23.293
No. No, no, no.

10:23.326 --> 10:25.528
- Look, I'm not doing this again.
- Wait!

10:25.562 --> 10:27.629
Wait. I'm so sorry I left.

10:27.663 --> 10:30.734
I made a...

10:30.768 --> 10:33.269
Whoa, hey, hey.

10:38.173 --> 10:42.846
I'm sorry.
I make a terrible umbrella.

10:42.879 --> 10:47.182
Doug, I know you have no reason
to take me back, and I can't guarantee

10:47.216 --> 10:51.053
that things won't end up
the same way they did last time,

10:51.086 --> 10:56.086
but the one thing I can guarantee
is that I'll love you forever.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.495
What am I going to do with you?

11:09.373 --> 11:11.942
Don't let Mr. Nobody
get in your head, Vic.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.476
It's just a painting.

11:13.509 --> 11:16.445
- Niles would know what to make of it.
- Yeah.

11:16.446 --> 11:17.446
He would.

11:38.668 --> 11:43.668
<i>Danny Cakes. 178 Danny Street.
Springfield, Ohio.</i>

11:48.312 --> 11:51.615
There's no Danny Street
in Springfield.

11:51.648 --> 11:54.283
According to this, there is.

11:54.317 --> 11:59.317
And someone there
knows something about Niles.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.869
Follow the cake, Vic.

12:11.902 --> 12:15.350
Always follow the cake.

12:38.360 --> 12:43.360
"Where's Niles?"
asked the cake shop.

12:49.370 --> 12:52.971
That's not weird at all.

13:37.620 --> 13:42.426
Right this way, gentlemen.

13:42.457 --> 13:45.009
Have a nice time.

13:50.966 --> 13:52.836
I'll be right with you, boys.

13:52.870 --> 13:57.519
Could you tell us where...

14:24.600 --> 14:27.803
Give it up for my Saucy
Songbirds, ladies and gentlemen.

14:29.873 --> 14:33.610
Yes! Boys,

14:33.644 --> 14:36.947
girls, and all those
in between.

14:36.980 --> 14:39.682
Welcome to Peeping Tom's
Perpetual Cabaret.

14:39.716 --> 14:42.918
I'm your host,
Maura Lee Karupt.

14:42.951 --> 14:44.754
How y'all feeling?

14:44.788 --> 14:48.792
What, are they shooting an
Ambien commercial in here?

14:48.826 --> 14:51.760
Okay, well,
maybe this will cheer you up.

14:51.793 --> 14:55.633
It appears we have
two new guests with us.

14:55.667 --> 15:00.336
Oh, look at these two serving us
Terminator, King Tut realness, honey.

15:00.370 --> 15:04.908
The word on the street is
that you're friends of Niles Caulder.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.543
Who told you that?

15:06.576 --> 15:08.346
- Danny did.
- Who's Danny?

15:08.379 --> 15:11.081
Oh, child,
is your battery slow?

15:11.115 --> 15:15.552
Danny is all around you.

15:15.585 --> 15:17.821
Danny the Street.

15:17.855 --> 15:19.423
Danny's on the street?

15:19.456 --> 15:23.460
I think she's saying
Danny is a street.

15:23.493 --> 15:24.696
The street's a "he"?

15:24.729 --> 15:29.729
Danny's gender queer,
and they use non-binary pronouns.

15:29.865 --> 15:31.933
Uh-huh. Okay.

15:31.969 --> 15:34.937
Oh, isn't that cute?

15:34.971 --> 15:37.642
Robo-boy doesn't understand
non-binary.

15:37.673 --> 15:41.711
Let me see if I can explain it to you
in a language you can understand. Um...

15:41.745 --> 15:44.947
01-001-110.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.182
Make sense?

15:46.216 --> 15:49.485
Just give me one second.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.287
Trying to find
my middle finger emoji. It's...

15:51.288 --> 15:56.288
Oh, this sweet little snack's
a bit salty.

15:56.759 --> 15:59.230
I like it.

15:59.263 --> 16:01.163
If you ever want to leave
Westworld and come live

16:01.166 --> 16:03.668
with the Dannyzens,
you just let me know.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.802
- The who?
- Danny travels all over the world,

16:06.836 --> 16:11.106
picking up those of us who have
slipped through society's cracks.

16:11.139 --> 16:14.375
We call ourselves
the Dannyzens.

16:14.409 --> 16:18.880
Oh.

16:18.916 --> 16:20.149
What?

16:20.182 --> 16:22.918
Maybe I should let them
explain for themselves.

16:22.951 --> 16:27.601
Go ahead.
Ask Danny a question.

16:28.292 --> 16:33.292
Um, Danny, do you know
Niles Caulder?

16:39.802 --> 16:41.738
So do we.

16:41.772 --> 16:44.322
Niles is missing.

16:56.153 --> 16:59.956
Oh, my God, yay!
Rita, you made it!

16:59.990 --> 17:02.557
- Karen.
- Hey, Karen!

17:02.591 --> 17:05.296
Cliffie, right?

17:05.327 --> 17:09.066
So great to finally meet you
in person.

17:09.097 --> 17:11.500
Jane's told me all about you.

17:11.535 --> 17:14.038
Like what?

17:14.069 --> 17:15.506
Oh, um...

17:15.538 --> 17:18.009
- Seriously?
- Okay, so here's the sitch.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.679
Doug's family just got in, and, well,
things are a little tense.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.380
Can you just cut her
a little slack?

17:23.381 --> 17:26.150
Jumping Christ
on a Pogo stick!

17:26.182 --> 17:27.592
Listen, Karen and I
are in love.

17:27.616 --> 17:29.093
And we're getting back together again.

17:29.117 --> 17:31.220
- And that's that.
- Douglas, please.

17:31.221 --> 17:33.423
- Since you were born...
- Nine hours of labor,

17:33.457 --> 17:35.727
this woman screamed through
with you. Nine!

17:35.759 --> 17:40.198
I swaddled you. I fed you with
these breasts. I loved you.

17:40.230 --> 17:44.500
And I tried to give you everything, so
you could have the best life possible.

17:44.535 --> 17:46.903
We came from miners,
God damn it!

17:46.935 --> 17:48.673
Nothing to our name but coal!

17:48.704 --> 17:53.375
And now, now, you're willing to throw
it all away on that trash witch whore.

17:53.411 --> 17:55.246
Whoa, Mom. Whoa.

17:55.278 --> 17:57.079
- Harsh.
- Right?

17:57.114 --> 17:58.713
I need you to help me
lighten the mood.

17:58.749 --> 18:01.183
What? No.
Why would I do that?

18:01.218 --> 18:03.586
Duh, 'cause we're best friends.

18:03.598 --> 18:05.020
No, we're not.

18:05.055 --> 18:10.055
Oh, my God, Rita,
you're so weird. Come.

18:10.527 --> 18:12.063
Um...

18:12.096 --> 18:16.664
Oh. Sorry, Cliffie, I would totally
invite you in, but I really need tonight

18:16.665 --> 18:18.736
- to go well.
- Oh.

18:18.769 --> 18:22.772
And you're sort of weird
and creepy, so...

18:22.807 --> 18:27.242
I just... I...
I just wanted to tell you,

18:27.278 --> 18:30.747
to tell all of you, I'm sorry.

18:30.779 --> 18:31.829
Uh-huh.

18:42.025 --> 18:43.795
The street talks.

18:43.826 --> 18:46.595
Of course the street talks.
Why wouldn't the street talk?

18:46.596 --> 18:52.700
Well, donkey dimension, Decreator, group
therapy. Just ride the wave, Vic.

18:52.701 --> 18:56.373
Hey.

18:56.405 --> 18:58.039
We were hoping
that you could tell us.

18:58.075 --> 19:00.778
That's
why we followed your cake.

19:00.810 --> 19:05.810
Can I ask you why your street
is so empty?

19:11.519 --> 19:12.519
Why?

19:29.137 --> 19:33.189
Who's Darren Jones?

20:06.608 --> 20:08.710
Extraordinary.

20:14.285 --> 20:16.220
Tell me about Ellsworth.

20:16.221 --> 20:17.685
I'm not
telling you anything.

20:17.688 --> 20:20.923
How about Charleston
or Edwards?

20:20.959 --> 20:24.259
Quite a few transfers
in such a short period of time.

20:24.295 --> 20:25.828
It's not normal.

20:25.863 --> 20:29.499
It seems you've struggled
with normalcy your entire life.

20:29.530 --> 20:31.067
Fuck you.

20:31.102 --> 20:35.372
Now you're concerned about
collateral damage? In Havana?

20:35.404 --> 20:38.173
You wanted a contingency plan.
Here it is!

20:43.614 --> 20:46.214
Good news,
Captain Trainor.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.118
A new mission
has presented itself.

20:49.153 --> 20:53.891
The Red Menace is knocking on our
door, not 100 miles from Miami.

20:53.923 --> 20:59.162
Thousands of American lives
in the balance.

20:59.163 --> 21:01.499
What the hell do you people
want from me?

21:01.530 --> 21:05.769
It's not about what we want.
It's about what we're offering.

21:05.803 --> 21:08.837
Your chance to serve
your country.

21:08.872 --> 21:10.574
To be a real man.

21:10.606 --> 21:15.606
Better than that,
your chance to be a hero.

21:18.248 --> 21:19.682
Go to hell.

21:19.717 --> 21:24.717
I'm going to need you
to go there for me, Captain.

21:58.520 --> 22:03.520
Yo, Danny,
what's the Bureau of Normalcy?

22:03.928 --> 22:08.566
It's a top secret government agency,
run by a bunch of demented zealots.

22:08.597 --> 22:12.102
They stomp out anything
they deem to be aberrations.

22:12.134 --> 22:13.769
And you know this how?

22:13.804 --> 22:18.804
Why are they
after you, Danny?

22:19.977 --> 22:24.114
All right now,
no need to get cheeky, Danny.

22:24.145 --> 22:26.517
We can tell them
the whole story.

22:26.548 --> 22:27.983
Couple of years back,

22:28.000 --> 22:31.054
Darren Jones botched a
search-and-destroy mission on Danny.

22:31.086 --> 22:33.589
Lost his partner
in the process.

22:33.624 --> 22:37.972
What happened to him?

22:43.567 --> 22:48.171
He became Maura Lee Karupt.

22:48.203 --> 22:49.740
Karen,

22:49.772 --> 22:54.772
are you sure getting back into this
relationship is the best idea?

22:54.877 --> 22:58.647
Does Doug even know
about your situation?

22:58.682 --> 23:04.354
Okay, I know I can be
a lot sometimes.

23:04.355 --> 23:08.290
But Doug and I have a real chance
of actually being happy together.

23:08.325 --> 23:09.826
Shouldn't we at least try?

23:09.858 --> 23:12.863
Even though you both make me
want to vomit into my purse,

23:12.895 --> 23:17.895
I can admit that you make
a cute-ish couple.

23:18.733 --> 23:20.135
Come here.

23:20.170 --> 23:24.307
Come here.

23:24.339 --> 23:26.978
Yeah.

23:27.009 --> 23:30.614
- God, you're such a fucking sap!
- Hammerhead.

23:30.646 --> 23:32.217
- What are you doing...
- Shut up!

23:32.250 --> 23:35.353
It wasn't easy yanking that twat
off the fucking driver's seat,

23:35.385 --> 23:39.521
so I have to make this quick.
Get us the fuck out of here, now!

23:39.557 --> 23:41.357
Do it yourself!
Or make Jane do it.

23:41.393 --> 23:44.528
Jane's not around. How do you think
we got stuck with Basic Bitch Barbie!

23:44.560 --> 23:47.412
Well, where is she?

23:53.671 --> 23:56.240
Don't worry about Jane, okay?

23:56.271 --> 23:58.441
Worry about Karen.
She's dangerous.

23:58.442 --> 24:02.211
And the more people indulge this
Nora Ephron bullshit of hers,

24:02.246 --> 24:05.048
the harder it is
to make her let go.

24:05.082 --> 24:06.650
She's just wants to be happy.

24:06.682 --> 24:09.818
- Is that so wrong?
- Give me a fuckin' break, okay?

24:09.854 --> 24:13.057
She has that walking
half-chub Doug

24:13.089 --> 24:15.290
under her weird
little fucking love spell.

24:15.325 --> 24:16.992
Love spell?

24:17.028 --> 24:20.432
I swear to God, Rita, if that dick
gets anywhere near my fucking bush,

24:20.463 --> 24:24.500
I'm gonna fucking kill you, okay? And
if I get fucked, you get fucked. Hmm.

24:24.535 --> 24:28.373
Can we go back to the part
about Karen's love spell?

24:28.404 --> 24:33.404
Mmm, whatever you do, don't
fall for that fucking bitch's...

24:40.048 --> 24:41.585
Dougie?

24:41.617 --> 24:43.653
- Yeah?
- You want another beer?

24:43.685 --> 24:44.988
Thanks, hon.

24:47.057 --> 24:48.826
- Karen.
- Hmm.

24:48.857 --> 24:52.630
I want nothing more
than for you to be happy.

24:52.663 --> 24:56.834
Really, I do,
but maybe just slow down.

24:56.865 --> 25:01.637
You're right.
I totally hear you.

25:01.672 --> 25:04.173
Douglas Jay Calhoon.

25:04.207 --> 25:05.207
Yeah.

25:05.209 --> 25:10.209
I can't go another day
without being your wife.

25:12.781 --> 25:15.617
Would you do me the honor
of becoming my husband?

25:15.653 --> 25:18.453
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

25:18.489 --> 25:19.890
That's it! That's it!

25:19.923 --> 25:21.826
No, I can't, I can't do this.

25:21.857 --> 25:24.662
Douglas, you cannot
marry this woman!

25:24.693 --> 25:27.198
- Mom.
- No, I have to say this.

25:27.230 --> 25:30.467
She just waltzes in your life.
She tears it to shreds.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.836
And then she breezes out
whenever it suits her.

25:32.868 --> 25:34.538
Dude, she's a ticking
time bomb.

25:34.569 --> 25:36.207
Stay out of this, Mick.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.618
The last time she left, you wouldn't
get out of bed for six months!

25:38.642 --> 25:42.577
If you marry Karen,
then that's it. We're done.

25:42.613 --> 25:47.250
Whoa.

25:47.284 --> 25:51.034
Do you all feel this way?

25:55.258 --> 25:57.594
- Dougie...
- Hmm?

25:57.626 --> 26:01.396
don't choose
between me and your family.

26:01.431 --> 26:06.304
Just choose love.

26:06.336 --> 26:08.415
- Yes. Yes! A thousand times yes.
- Oh, my God.

26:08.439 --> 26:13.439
- I love you so much.
- No, no, no! For fucking Christ's sake.

26:14.912 --> 26:16.944
Congratulations!

26:19.383 --> 26:21.616
Guys! It's about time.

26:21.652 --> 26:24.086
Oh, yes! What?

26:24.118 --> 26:27.191
A toast!

26:27.223 --> 26:30.794
Karen, the day you came
into our lives...

26:30.826 --> 26:32.828
You're everything
I hoped my son...

26:32.863 --> 26:36.598
- Oh! Don't you start now.
- I can't even...

26:36.634 --> 26:38.500
All right,
let's have a drink, yeah?

26:38.535 --> 26:39.635
Okay.

27:02.125 --> 27:04.075
Punk.

27:07.230 --> 27:11.934
Do those people out there have
any idea who you used to work for?

27:11.969 --> 27:14.971
I tired to tell them, but I...

27:15.005 --> 27:18.709
I can't.

27:18.740 --> 27:20.644
I'm not a bad person.

27:20.678 --> 27:22.479
You work for the Bureau
of Normalcy.

27:22.511 --> 27:24.515
I know exactly what kind
of person you are.

27:24.548 --> 27:29.548
You don't know
a damn thing about me.

27:31.055 --> 27:34.423
For a long time,
neither did I.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.326
I was supposed to
hate this place.

27:37.362 --> 27:42.362
Working for the Bureau, you're supposed
to hate anything that's abnormal.

27:43.834 --> 27:45.903
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

27:45.934 --> 27:49.506
<i>Something about Danny
felt right.</i>

27:49.538 --> 27:50.740
<i>It felt like home.</i>

28:03.019 --> 28:08.019
<i>A weight had been
lifted off me.</i>

28:08.226 --> 28:09.624
<i>How bad it is, Agent?</i>

28:09.625 --> 28:11.461
<i>Abnormal to a factor of what?</i>

28:11.493 --> 28:12.845
Stand by.

28:36.053 --> 28:38.288
<i>I felt lighter.</i>

28:38.320 --> 28:42.226
<i>Like I was more of myself
than I had ever been.</i>

28:42.259 --> 28:47.259
<i>Agent Wilson,
what do you see?</i>

28:49.798 --> 28:53.769
<i>Agent Wilson.</i>

28:53.804 --> 28:56.641
<i>Agent Wilson.</i>

28:56.673 --> 29:00.711
<i>And that's when
Maura Lee Karupt was born.</i>

29:00.743 --> 29:05.743
<i>My drag name was my own
personal "fuck you" to the Bureau.</i>

29:06.451 --> 29:10.886
<i>I knew then I couldn't let
any harm come to this place.</i>

29:10.921 --> 29:14.057
<i>So I tipped Danny off.</i>

29:14.089 --> 29:17.259
<i>And they were able to jump
before Darren could attack.</i>

29:22.731 --> 29:25.669
Yes, Danny can jump.

29:25.701 --> 29:27.069
Anywhere around the world,

29:27.104 --> 29:31.575
which is a helpful thing,
because Darren's obsessed.

29:31.606 --> 29:34.678
He's been
following us ever since.

29:34.711 --> 29:37.779
He just won't let it go.

29:37.815 --> 29:39.250
The Bureau never does.

29:39.281 --> 29:42.884
Danny is supposed to be
a safe haven for people like us.

29:42.920 --> 29:45.489
But nobody feels safe
here anymore.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.191
It's not right.

29:47.222 --> 29:52.222
No one should ever have to feel
uncomfortable in their own skin.

29:52.796 --> 29:56.932
I don't know how much longer
we can keep this up.

29:56.967 --> 29:59.103
They all seem
pretty happy to me.

29:59.134 --> 30:03.207
Trust me,
those people are scared.

30:03.240 --> 30:07.277
But, still, they show up with
a brave face and come anyway.

30:07.308 --> 30:10.681
- Why?
- For Danny.

30:10.712 --> 30:13.951
It's a perpetual cabaret
for a reason.

30:13.982 --> 30:17.721
This street thrives
on the Dannyzens' happiness.

30:17.755 --> 30:21.557
We keep the party going,
we keep Danny going.

30:21.592 --> 30:23.326
But we're running on fumes.

30:23.358 --> 30:24.596
If the party stops...

30:24.627 --> 30:29.627
Then Danny's heart stops right
along with it. And they win.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.871
The Bureau of Normalcy.

30:37.508 --> 30:42.508
"Normal" ain't nothing
but a state of mind.

30:47.817 --> 30:49.018
We need
to help these people.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.752
We don't need
to do anything.

30:50.788 --> 30:52.756
Man, look at this place!

30:52.788 --> 30:56.294
And you seriously want
to run away, again?

30:56.326 --> 30:59.230
I don't need to
justify myself to you.

30:59.261 --> 31:02.633
If I have to bow out
of this one, then I'll bow out.

31:02.664 --> 31:04.166
I'm not going up
against the Bureau.

31:04.201 --> 31:07.604
What the hell's going on
with you, man?

31:07.636 --> 31:12.438
What did those people
do to you?

31:13.576 --> 31:15.747
Just forget it.

31:15.778 --> 31:19.317
Man, I thought you was done with the
whole Cowardly Lion routine, huh?

31:19.348 --> 31:21.486
Aren't you sick
of being that guy?

31:21.519 --> 31:23.921
And what kind
of guy are you, Vic?

31:23.952 --> 31:25.923
You're a hero, right?

31:25.954 --> 31:28.057
Maybe you could teach me
to be more like you.

31:28.092 --> 31:31.930
Or maybe, maybe, Mr. Nobody
was onto something.

31:31.961 --> 31:37.261
Should I buy my cape before or after
I kill my family and friends?

31:41.672 --> 31:43.972
If you want to bail,
then bail.

31:44.008 --> 31:46.611
I'm done trying to
stiffen your spine.

31:46.644 --> 31:51.644
Good. 'Cause I'm done letting
other people tell me who I am.

32:01.589 --> 32:03.361
I underestimated you, Captain.

32:03.394 --> 32:08.199
I thought you were nothing but a
degenerate radioactive flyboy.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.500
But it seems you are
so much more.

32:11.535 --> 32:14.806
What happened?

32:26.481 --> 32:28.684
What the hell is that?

32:28.720 --> 32:33.720
That, Captain Trainor,
is what's really inside you.

32:34.156 --> 32:39.096
That is who you really are.

32:48.471 --> 32:53.471
I do. I do. I do.
I do. I do. I do.

32:54.845 --> 32:57.145
Hey, Ri-Ri.

32:57.181 --> 33:00.250
I understand
that you love Doug,

33:00.284 --> 33:02.785
but we all know you're just
going to end up leaving him again.

33:02.786 --> 33:04.819
What? No.

33:04.855 --> 33:06.624
Dougie and I are endgame.

33:06.655 --> 33:11.493
I don't know what that means. I just
know that it's youthful and irritating.

33:11.528 --> 33:17.467
It means me and Doug are going
to be together forever.

33:17.468 --> 33:20.371
Oh, for Christ's sake, Karen,
cut the shit!

33:20.403 --> 33:23.640
That man and his family don't
have a say in what's happening.

33:23.673 --> 33:25.776
What you're doing is wrong.

33:25.807 --> 33:26.875
What am I doing?

33:26.910 --> 33:29.113
Your little spell.

33:29.144 --> 33:30.279
Oh, whatever.

33:30.314 --> 33:31.913
Dough's love for you
isn't real.

33:31.949 --> 33:33.182
Yes, it is!

33:33.217 --> 33:35.986
Why are you being
so extra right now, ugh!

33:36.019 --> 33:37.386
Then prove it.

33:37.421 --> 33:42.192
If your love is real,
then break the spell.

33:42.226 --> 33:45.194
You know what, Rita?

33:45.229 --> 33:48.663
Why don't you crawl out of
my ass and go fuck yourself?

33:48.699 --> 33:50.034
Excuse me.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.836
Don't put your shit on me

33:51.868 --> 33:56.073
just because your life is like
<i>Grey Gardens</i> level pathetic.

33:56.105 --> 33:58.642
If your goal is to be
a walking cautionary tale,

33:58.643 --> 34:01.278
well, congrats,
consider me cautioned.

34:01.313 --> 34:07.883
I will do everything in my power to never
end up like you, a sad, tired old crone

34:07.884 --> 34:12.885
who is so ridiculously past her
prime, she doesn't even know it.

34:15.791 --> 34:19.563
Believe me, I know it.

34:19.596 --> 34:21.097
Oh, my gosh.

34:21.130 --> 34:23.132
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

34:23.166 --> 34:26.302
That is... That is totally
the stress talking.

34:26.335 --> 34:28.539
- Hmm.
- Honey, it's just that

34:28.572 --> 34:32.375
today is a special day, and
we really need to get ready.

34:32.409 --> 34:33.744
Okay?

34:33.777 --> 34:36.679
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

34:36.713 --> 34:38.063
For what?

35:06.175 --> 35:09.746
Really, dude,
is that all you got?

35:09.780 --> 35:11.815
Think you can do better?

35:11.849 --> 35:16.619
I've seen <i>Flashdance</i> 87 times.
What do you think?

35:16.652 --> 35:19.255
Okay, kittens.

35:19.289 --> 35:23.025
It's time for karaoke.

35:23.059 --> 35:25.463
Oh, hey, mommy dearest.

35:25.496 --> 35:27.965
All new comers are welcome.

35:27.998 --> 35:32.347
There's a price of admission.

35:36.239 --> 35:40.143
You gotta sing, baby.

35:40.177 --> 35:41.512
I don't sing.

35:41.545 --> 35:46.545
Well, we have to keep
this party popping, okay?

35:49.518 --> 35:52.922
Don't be scared.

35:52.956 --> 35:54.791
I'm not scared.

35:57.693 --> 36:01.293
Then get up there.

36:36.333 --> 36:40.137
"We come into
this world unknown,

36:40.170 --> 36:44.108
but know
that we are not alone.

36:44.141 --> 36:47.110
They try to knock us down,

36:47.143 --> 36:48.676
but change is coming.

36:48.677 --> 36:49.678
It's our time now."

39:53.797 --> 39:55.746
I don't sing.

40:04.876 --> 40:06.911
Grid,
proceed on auto-search.

40:06.943 --> 40:10.246
Expand the radius
another two blocks.

40:10.280 --> 40:15.230
Let me know
if you find anything.

40:16.920 --> 40:19.456
Thought you were
bowing out.

40:19.489 --> 40:20.857
I don't know
what I'm doing.

40:20.858 --> 40:22.893
Then you better hurry.

40:22.927 --> 40:27.264
'Cause nobody takes
their bow after me.

40:27.297 --> 40:30.735
- What are you doing?
- Danny can't go on living like this.

40:30.768 --> 40:34.005
And I can't risk what
will happen if they do.

40:34.038 --> 40:37.172
It's time for me to go back
and fix the mess I've made.

40:37.206 --> 40:38.208
How?

40:38.242 --> 40:40.610
I'm going back to the Bureau.

40:40.643 --> 40:42.045
Back to my old life.

40:45.382 --> 40:46.983
It's the only way, Danny.

40:47.018 --> 40:50.353
If I go back, I can
throw 'em off your scent.

40:50.387 --> 40:53.757
I can say
I was deep undercover,

40:53.791 --> 40:58.027
tell them it took me a while,
but I finally rid the world

40:58.061 --> 41:02.632
of the abomination that is
Danny the Street.

41:02.666 --> 41:04.869
I promise I'll give a better
performance than this one.

41:04.902 --> 41:06.471
You can't go back
to that place.

41:06.503 --> 41:09.404
If they get so much as a whiff
of who you really are, they'll...

41:09.405 --> 41:10.506
I don't care.

41:10.507 --> 41:13.143
As long as
everyone here is safe,

41:13.175 --> 41:15.126
I'll be okay.

41:18.215 --> 41:21.284
Thanks for letting me stay
over the rainbow, Danny.

41:31.260 --> 41:34.597
It's the Bureau.

41:34.632 --> 41:38.302
They're here.

41:38.335 --> 41:40.402
Okay, Danny,
I'm gonna start walking.

41:40.436 --> 41:42.271
The second I step off
the end of the block,

41:42.306 --> 41:45.708
you jump.
I'll cover you, okay?

41:45.742 --> 41:46.742
What?

41:53.684 --> 41:57.554
I gotta say,
I'm with the street.

41:57.588 --> 42:00.289
So then what do we do?

42:02.458 --> 42:06.509
Let's turn the party, girl.

42:09.132 --> 42:11.467
You in?

42:14.338 --> 42:18.987
Look alive, gentlemen.

42:34.958 --> 42:38.561
Jesus, look
at this human trash here.

42:40.697 --> 42:42.733
You know, Darren,

42:42.766 --> 42:47.766
men as old as you
really shouldn't throw shade.

42:48.137 --> 42:50.940
You might hurt your back.

42:50.974 --> 42:52.842
Morris?

42:52.876 --> 42:54.210
My God!

42:54.244 --> 42:56.414
What the hell has
this abomination done to you?

42:56.447 --> 43:00.884
Danny didn't do anything,
except help me realize who I am.

43:00.916 --> 43:03.619
What? No.

43:03.652 --> 43:07.391
No, this is not who your are,
Morris. You're a man.

43:07.422 --> 43:10.594
- This place, these people are...
- No.

43:10.628 --> 43:15.628
You don't get to tell me or anyone
else who they are ever again.

43:16.500 --> 43:20.170
I am proud of the person
I see in the mirror.

43:20.204 --> 43:26.664
My face is beat. My look is flawless,
and I am dusted from head to toe.

43:26.943 --> 43:31.943
The only thing I am not
is scared of you.

43:33.550 --> 43:38.255
Fan out, boys!

43:38.288 --> 43:39.487
I said...

43:44.728 --> 43:46.563
Thanks, Danny.

43:49.733 --> 43:51.335
You fucking freak.

43:51.369 --> 43:55.539
Fabulosity incarnate
stands before you, Darren.

43:55.572 --> 43:58.809
Show some goddamn respect.

43:58.842 --> 44:00.643
Like hell I will.

44:00.677 --> 44:02.411
Didn't your mama tell you?

44:04.014 --> 44:06.349
Never lay your hands
on a woman.

44:30.340 --> 44:31.641
Go home, Darren.

44:31.675 --> 44:33.577
And don't ever come back
here again.

44:38.449 --> 44:39.992
You go back to the Bureau,

44:40.016 --> 44:42.283
and you tell them Danny
the Street is off limits.

44:43.221 --> 44:45.521
Maybe I'll put you
on our list instead.

44:49.226 --> 44:50.827
I'm already on it.

44:50.860 --> 44:55.166
Tell them Captain Trainor sends his best.

44:55.199 --> 44:57.867
Every time,
the dream is the same.

44:57.902 --> 45:02.472
Somebody's welding me,
except when the mask come up,

45:02.505 --> 45:04.106
it's Jennifer Beals.

45:04.139 --> 45:06.108
Whoa.

45:06.141 --> 45:08.143
Who?

45:08.177 --> 45:10.847
Bro...

45:10.880 --> 45:13.918
What does it have to do
with the rat in your head?

45:13.951 --> 45:17.755
Cliff, thank heavens
you're still out here.

45:17.788 --> 45:20.724
Jane wants to see you
right away.

45:20.757 --> 45:24.657
Keep it real, kid.

45:37.041 --> 45:39.275
No, it's no problem.

45:39.309 --> 45:42.009
I'm happy to help.

45:47.550 --> 45:49.052
Me, too.

45:49.085 --> 45:54.085
You never told us
how you know each other.

45:55.056 --> 45:58.661
Yeah.

45:58.695 --> 46:01.764
I'm fine.

46:04.501 --> 46:09.501
It's just, I could really use
the Chief's help right now.

46:12.708 --> 46:15.559
I'm scared.

46:19.583 --> 46:21.751
I'm scared we may
never get him back.

46:21.784 --> 46:23.954
And I'm scared
what might happen if we don't.

46:23.987 --> 46:26.824
This may be a long shot, and I
know Niles has his secrets,

46:26.856 --> 46:28.760
but if you could
tell us anything

46:28.793 --> 46:33.793
that could possibly help us figure out what
Mr. Nobody's done with the Chief, then...

46:35.733 --> 46:39.931
Yeah. That's who took Niles.

46:47.643 --> 46:50.646
Please, Danny.

46:50.681 --> 46:54.217
I'm begging you.

46:54.251 --> 46:55.818
We need him.

47:24.882 --> 47:27.117
Was I that bad?

47:27.150 --> 47:30.420
Oh.

47:30.454 --> 47:35.224
All right, open them.

47:36.592 --> 47:38.963
What do you think, Cliffie?

47:38.996 --> 47:43.233
Uh, what the ever
living shit is happening?

47:43.266 --> 47:45.402
Dougie and I
are getting married.

47:51.273 --> 47:52.708
Now?

47:52.742 --> 47:54.677
When you know it's right,
why wait?

47:54.710 --> 47:58.882
Uh-huh, where's Jane?

47:58.916 --> 48:01.784
Jane means a lot to you,
doesn't she?

48:01.818 --> 48:03.719
I can tell by the way
she talks about you,

48:03.753 --> 48:05.655
that you mean
a lot to her, too.

48:05.688 --> 48:07.791
And I was thinking

48:07.824 --> 48:09.427
this wouldn't be
a real wedding

48:09.460 --> 48:12.362
without someone to
walk me down the aisle.

48:12.396 --> 48:16.934
And, well, I know I'm not
a cool, manic pixie dream girl

48:16.967 --> 48:21.672
like Jane is, but...

48:21.704 --> 48:23.639
Cliff,

48:23.672 --> 48:24.775
would you give me away?

48:24.806 --> 48:26.443
What, are you
fucking nuts?

48:26.476 --> 48:31.476
Come on, this is the most
important day of my life.

48:32.547 --> 48:34.518
What do you say?

48:34.552 --> 48:36.552
You have incredibly
psychotic eyes.

48:36.585 --> 48:37.722
Ugh, just forget it.

48:37.755 --> 48:40.556
This is crazy, Karen.
You can't marry this guy.

48:40.590 --> 48:41.757
"Crazy"? It's what I want.

48:41.791 --> 48:43.460
And what about
what Jane wants?

48:43.492 --> 48:45.262
Just back off, Cliff.

48:45.295 --> 48:48.431
Babe, you okay?

48:48.465 --> 48:50.833
Mmm-hmm.

48:50.867 --> 48:52.969
Holy shit!

48:53.003 --> 48:56.273
A robot for our wedding!

48:56.306 --> 48:59.543
- How cool.
- Back off, Dermot Mulroney.

48:59.576 --> 49:02.945
Whoa, chillax, asshole.

49:02.980 --> 49:06.416
- Oh.
- I think what you meant was...

49:06.449 --> 49:08.451
Doug, oh, my God!

49:08.485 --> 49:09.721
Just leave us alone.

49:09.753 --> 49:12.322
No. I have no idea
what the hell's going on here,

49:12.356 --> 49:14.391
but I'm not letting you
go through with this.

49:14.425 --> 49:17.393
Not unless I know
that Jane's okay with it.

49:17.427 --> 49:20.130
- Okay, we're leaving.
- What are you doing?

49:20.164 --> 49:22.797
Let me go!
You... Just let me go!

49:22.833 --> 49:26.135
You have no right to do this!

49:26.170 --> 49:29.619
Don't fucking touch me!

49:34.210 --> 49:39.210
I asked you people
to do one fucking thing!

49:43.487 --> 49:48.190
Sorry, Dougie, wedding's off.

49:48.224 --> 49:49.224
No!

49:55.666 --> 49:57.300
Oh, Dougie, I'm so sorry.

49:57.335 --> 50:00.271
I'm so sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
I would never hurt you.

50:00.304 --> 50:05.304
Never hurt you.
I'm so sorry. I... I...

50:24.027 --> 50:26.728
Help me!

50:35.239 --> 50:38.208
No! Dougie!
Dougie, it's okay.

50:38.242 --> 50:39.809
Hold on. It's okay.

50:39.842 --> 50:41.844
I'm still here.
I'm still here.

50:44.514 --> 50:47.483
Let go of me,
you motherfuckers!

50:50.018 --> 50:53.422
<i>Jane?
Jane, are you in there?</i>

50:53.456 --> 50:56.927
Jane? Hey, Jane?

50:56.960 --> 50:59.429
I'm sorry, Jane.

50:59.460 --> 51:01.731
Hey, it's me.

51:01.764 --> 51:05.501
Jane! Come on, Jane.

51:05.534 --> 51:06.969
Jane.

51:07.003 --> 51:08.237
Jane.
