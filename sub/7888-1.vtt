02:04.500 --> 02:05.848
In the beginning

02:06.654 --> 02:08.144
There was only The Word,

02:09.082 --> 02:13.712
And with The Word He spoke into being
the realm of Heaven and its angels.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.214
And He spoke into being
the sun, the moon and the stars.

02:19.132 --> 02:21.217
And then the Earth,
its oceans and its beasts.

02:23.136 --> 02:25.221
And finally He spoke into being
His masterpiece:

02:27.139 --> 02:29.224
Us.

02:29.140 --> 02:31.225
And we were His children
to love, keep and protect.

02:33.146 --> 02:37.398
Placed above all others, we were
His most cherished creation,

02:38.191 --> 02:40.276
most beloved on Earth
and in Heaven.

02:41.193 --> 02:43.277
This was The Word as it
was spoken to the prophets,

02:45.197 --> 02:47.283
and then it was
handed down to us.

02:48.199 --> 02:51.703
The Word of God
our Father in Heaven.

02:53.246 --> 02:57.248
And a thousand generations
found shelter in that Word

03:01.253 --> 03:03.337
So here we are tonight,

03:04.298 --> 03:07.801
The Word
becomes flesh and blood.

03:10.261 --> 03:13.848
Our flesh and blood.
And I got news.

03:14.263 --> 03:18.434
The Lord, He didn't keep his
Word, No. He backed out on it.

03:19.310 --> 03:24.023
He abandoned His kids a long time ago,
and He ain't payin' child support.

03:24.315 --> 03:28.527
- Am I right, Maggie ?
- You got that right, preacher boy.

03:31.362 --> 03:35.407
Brothers and sisters,
our Father is a deadbeat dad !

03:36.366 --> 03:38.452
- Amen to that.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.454
That's right. And we can all
forget about the "divine plan, "

03:43.413 --> 03:45.499
because there
is no divine plan.

03:45.416 --> 03:47.501
It's a blind universe
out there, friends.

03:48.419 --> 03:52.631
Our lives are nothing but
a chain of unrelated accidents.

03:53.423 --> 03:55.508
- Get used to it !
- Get used to it !

03:56.426 --> 03:58.511
Bad things happen to good people
for no reason. Get used to it.

04:00.428 --> 04:02.515
Get used to it ! - Good things they
happen to bad people for no reason.

04:05.434 --> 04:07.520
- Get used to it ! -
Get used to it ! - Say it again !

04:08.478 --> 04:10.564
- Get used to it !
- I can't hear you !
- Get used to it !

04:12.481 --> 04:14.566
- Do you want salvation ?
- We want salvation !

04:14.483 --> 04:16.569
- Do you want it now ?
- We want it now !

04:16.483 --> 04:19.362
God is dead !

04:21.531 --> 04:25.369
God is not dead.
He just doesn't give a damn.

05:15.249 --> 05:18.711
Please help me. Please.
Oh, God.

05:23.224 --> 05:25.032
No.

07:13.298 --> 07:15.576
Praise the Lord.

07:16.716 --> 07:18.217
It's done.

07:21.586 --> 07:26.605
No. No, I did what you told me.

07:26.605 --> 07:29.609
The blasphemer is dead.

07:33.962 --> 07:36.854
Oh. Oh.

07:39.093 --> 07:39.093
Oh.

07:41.915 --> 07:44.627
- Oh, but I couldn't.

07:44.627 --> 07:46.393
-...pushed me out of the way before...

07:49.593 --> 07:51.565
I'm sorry.

07:55.278 --> 07:57.519
I can find him again.

08:01.789 --> 08:04.445
- I can!
No.

08:04.445 --> 08:07.477
Yes. Yes.

08:08.310 --> 08:10.897
Please.

08:16.557 --> 08:18.198
No. Don't go.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.759
Don't leave me alone.

08:21.286 --> 08:23.008
Please.

08:25.122 --> 08:26.779
Please.

08:39.990 --> 08:46.400
Ohh.

10:11.094 --> 10:13.180
Hey, Joseph.

10:14.099 --> 10:16.185
L-282's mom
wants his corneas back.

10:17.104 --> 10:19.189
- Did you give her the
"gift of sight" rap ? - Yep.

10:19.106 --> 10:21.195
Says they were harvested
without her consent.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.240
- She wants her kid to go to the
next world intact. - Mm.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.246
"Take heed,
you senseless ones.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.248
Does He who
formed the eye not see ?"

10:31.165 --> 10:33.253
- Huh ?
- Psalm 94.

10:34.170 --> 10:36.255
Deal with it, Carl.

10:37.217 --> 10:40.889
All right.
Let's see what we have here.

10:42.222 --> 10:45.353
Ahhh. Leadpoisoning.

10:47.273 --> 10:51.236
Hmm. Okay, Rasputin.
What army did you piss off ?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.387
Allright.
Let's do a liver temp. Thermometer.

11:09.305 --> 11:11.391
Okay.

11:11.307 --> 11:13.396
Do the honors.

11:14.354 --> 11:16.441
Okay.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.443
Eh. The liver's
that away, Magellan.

11:19.361 --> 11:23.366
There you go. T.O.D.
approximately 8:00 P.M., huh ?

11:24.370 --> 11:26.456
All right. See what else
we got on our John Doe here.

11:28.416 --> 11:30.503
Um...

11:30.376 --> 11:32.463
"Danyael Rosales."

11:33.382 --> 11:35.468
Danyael.
Funny spelling, huh ?

11:36.386 --> 11:40.475
"Father unknown.
Mother, Valerie Rosales, deceased."

11:43.437 --> 11:46.776
Valerie Rosales.
Oh, Jesus.

11:56.499 --> 11:58.585
It's starting again.

11:58.502 --> 12:00.587
It all comes back,
over and over again and again.

12:01.506 --> 12:05.303
- Never stops, never ends.
- What do you mean. ?

12:05.553 --> 12:09.226
Look. Look
at that burn pattern. Look.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.644
- It's like...
- Go on.

12:12.521 --> 12:16.528
It's like she got hit with napalm
and never moved.

12:17.571 --> 12:21.159
All right.
These are from the scene.

12:21.576 --> 12:23.662
Okay.

12:23.580 --> 12:28.337
You get hit with a blast like that,
don't you curl up into a tighter ball,

12:28.627 --> 12:30.715
expose less skin ?

12:31.633 --> 12:33.719
- Are you asking me ?
- I've asked myself a thousand times.

12:35.638 --> 12:39.437
- I don'tknow.
- Look at the body position.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.775
I'm lookin.

12:43.693 --> 12:46.404
Closer.

12:46.696 --> 12:49.410
Closer.

12:50.703 --> 12:54.374
It's like she was
shielding something.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.337
Yes.

12:57.713 --> 12:59.799
Yeah.

12:59.716 --> 13:02.721
That something...

13:03.722 --> 13:05.808
was herchild

13:05.767 --> 13:09.145
She was
protecting her child.

13:10.773 --> 13:13.987
You gave him your life.

13:14.779 --> 13:18.033
That still wasn't enough.

13:40.272 --> 13:42.357
So you, uh, personally
knew the victim, huh ?

13:42.272 --> 13:45.109
We go back.

13:45.317 --> 13:48.904
I know him from
before the big bang.

13:49.322 --> 13:51.408
The big bang ?

13:52.324 --> 13:56.327
- When exactly was the big bang ?
- The beginning.

14:16.428 --> 14:18.513
- Good night, Joseph.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.474
Yeah.
Good night, Kyle.

14:38.490 --> 14:40.576
All right. Look. I'm going to let you go,
but I may have to call you back...

14:42.493 --> 14:44.578
later on down the line
as a material witness.

14:45.495 --> 14:49.207
Gabriel... Is there no last name ?
I mean,

14:50.541 --> 14:52.626
is it like the Artist Formerly
Known As Yanni or something ?

14:54.545 --> 14:56.631
- Sting.
- I thought it was Yanni.

14:57.547 --> 14:59.632
Shows you how far out oftouch I am.
Is this... this address current, "Gabriel" ?

15:01.552 --> 15:05.388
I can tell you
in two words: un-fortunately.

15:07.556 --> 15:09.642
Is that with a hyphen ?

15:10.559 --> 15:13.812
- Slash.
- Date of birth ?

15:15.606 --> 15:17.690
There's no date of birth
here. Why is that ?

15:18.607 --> 15:23.320
I asked the woman at the Department
of Motor Vehicles that same question.

15:23.653 --> 15:27.615
She told me not to bother her
on a coffee break.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.745
D.M.V.

15:33.662 --> 15:35.746
All right. Why don't you tell me ?
How old are you ?

15:37.709 --> 15:40.585
Thirty-nine.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.755
Hmm.

15:44.672 --> 15:48.091
H-How old do I look ?
Be cruel.

15:52.721 --> 15:56.349
I'll just put down "39"
instead, huh ?

15:58.179 --> 15:59.166
You know what?

15:59.749 --> 16:04.269
Fact is I'm old enough
to know better, Sparky.

16:07.711 --> 16:12.533
- What'd you call me ? - That's what they
called you when you were a kid, right ?

16:14.823 --> 16:16.908
Yeah. You did good

16:34.842 --> 16:36.927
- Can you buzz me in, Clark ?
No. Not before that.

16:41.888 --> 16:46.268
- Where's your morgue ?
- That's off-limits to the public, sir.

16:46.894 --> 16:49.854
A.Z.Jones, FBl.

16:53.941 --> 16:58.279
That'll be two floors down.
Tunnel access to the sub-basement.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.089
I'm gonna have to ask you
to identify the body, ma'am.

17:21.006 --> 17:23.090
I'm also gonna have to ask you
wait just a little bit longer here.

17:24.010 --> 17:28.097
- There'll be somebody along
to help you. - Thank you.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.268
I always knew
we'd see each other again,

18:22.228 --> 18:24.313
but I never thought
you'd look so...

18:25.231 --> 18:28.025
different.

18:28.233 --> 18:32.069
We become the thing we fear.
I let myself go.

18:33.237 --> 18:36.740
Obviously.
Or I wouldn't be here.

18:40.242 --> 18:43.495
- Ah.
- I need the heart.

18:44.247 --> 18:48.583
You, more than anyone, know what he is.
He's their last hope.

18:49.293 --> 18:51.377
I never know
what side you're on, Zophael.

18:52.296 --> 18:56.800
Well, that should be infinitely clear
to you now. Come back to us.

18:58.342 --> 19:01.970
We can retake
what's rightfully ours.

19:02.347 --> 19:06.557
We can make it like it was
before the monkeys. Remember ?

19:07.350 --> 19:09.434
Or has this place completely
befouled your senses ?

19:09.351 --> 19:13.063
I like it here.
I even learned to drive.

19:21.363 --> 19:23.448
You know what
your one flaw is, Gabriel ?

19:24.407 --> 19:28.828
You only see what you want to see.
Have you ever looked around ?

19:29.411 --> 19:33.958
Our Creator poured all His grace
into this world, but do you see it ?

19:34.417 --> 19:38.002
- Do you see it anywhere ?
- Not yet.

19:40.463 --> 19:44.508
Destroying Heaven
is not what I was up to, Zophael.

19:45.467 --> 19:49.010
Not even Lucifer,
is that arrogant?

19:52.472 --> 19:55.142
Go on.

19:55.476 --> 19:58.686
Out of my way... monkey.

22:20.978 --> 22:24.397
- I had to know.

22:44.041 --> 22:47.376
Ah. Thank you
for not jamming.

23:13.150 --> 23:16.359
Where did he go, Joseph ?

23:17.152 --> 23:20.322
- What ?
- Where is he ?

23:53.464 --> 23:56.688
No. You don't just stand
there straight-faced

23:56.688 --> 23:59.107
and tell me he walked
right out of here.

23:59.107 --> 24:01.875
- You don't do that.
- I'm sorry.

24:02.318 --> 24:04.403
Sorry ? How am I
supposed to take that, huh ?

24:06.279 --> 24:10.491
Probably the same way I have
for a very long time. Badly.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.411
I just lost the only thing
I cared about...

24:14.328 --> 24:16.412
in this whole
fucked-up universe.

24:17.330 --> 24:21.000
You haven't seen "badly,"
sir. Not yet.

24:51.734 --> 24:55.490
What's it like
to wake up as dead meat...

24:55.742 --> 24:57.826
with the buzzards circling ?

24:58.742 --> 25:00.829
Do I know you ?

25:00.788 --> 25:04.419
I know you from
before you were born.

25:07.799 --> 25:10.634
Both times.

25:16.852 --> 25:19.480
Huh ?

25:42.928 --> 25:45.015
"Zophael. Spy of God."

25:45.935 --> 25:48.020
"Bridge between rebel and
loyal factions within Heaven.

25:48.937 --> 25:53.026
His true allegiance is unclear
from religious texts."

25:55.989 --> 25:59.493
My kingdom
for a straight answer.

28:02.455 --> 28:05.415
Pyriel. Pyriel.

28:07.461 --> 28:10.673
Who the hell is Pyriel ?

28:26.528 --> 28:29.615
He died in my arms.

28:37.586 --> 28:41.966
T.O.D. was 8:00 P.M. That
was taken six hours later.

28:42.592 --> 28:46.723
Look. I still don't believe what
you're tryin' to tell me.

28:54.650 --> 28:58.406
I was afraid of that.
All right. Let's go.

28:59.657 --> 29:02.327
Where ?

29:03.662 --> 29:08.211
There are things that ghosts
and civil servants just shouldn't know.

29:12.716 --> 29:15.638
No. You drive.

32:46.510 --> 32:48.595
Embryos and idiots.

32:49.515 --> 32:52.559
I hate this place.

33:55.730 --> 33:57.816
"ln the final hour shall come one born...

33:58.733 --> 34:00.819
with the heart ofan angel
and the soul of a man."

34:02.779 --> 34:04.866
Ever hear
of a nephalim ?

34:04.784 --> 34:08.789
- A what ? - Take your
vitamins, Vincent. Good boy.

34:10.791 --> 34:12.876
Nephalim.
Half angel, half man.

34:13.839 --> 34:15.922
Old Testament's chock-full of 'em.
They're very nasty guys.

34:17.842 --> 34:19.929
And very, very hard
to kill.

34:20.848 --> 34:22.933
Am I right or am I right,
Boris. ?

34:22.849 --> 34:26.438
Are you saying
Danyael's a nephalim ?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.987
Am I ?
I guess I am.

34:31.862 --> 34:35.199
Do you really
believe that ?

34:38.913 --> 34:41.585
Look.

34:43.922 --> 34:46.007
I've had four
gutted hermaphrodites...

34:46.925 --> 34:50.638
burn to black pitch
right under my nose.

34:50.972 --> 34:53.058
I've had one cop,
my best friend,

34:52.973 --> 34:57.063
driven insane by the angels
shrieking in his head...

34:57.981 --> 35:00.067
before somehow
spontaneously combusting...

35:00.986 --> 35:03.071
in a madhouse he had mistaken
for a monastery.

35:04.032 --> 35:06.117
A pretty young woman, now dead
knocked up by a stranger...

35:08.037 --> 35:10.122
who left her three months, pregnant
in only 48 hours.

35:11.041 --> 35:13.128
And just yesterday, a young man,
allegedly her son,

35:15.004 --> 35:17.091
shot up six ways to sun down,,
crawled out of a drawer...

35:18.050 --> 35:21.431
and waltzed out
like Lazarus.

35:22.056 --> 35:26.353
So, yeah, I'm pretty much open
to a buffet of possibilities.

35:27.063 --> 35:30.067
Any suggestions ?

35:31.110 --> 35:33.696
No.

36:06.426 --> 36:08.497
What's the "D" for ?

36:09.450 --> 36:12.389
Uh, "doughnut."

36:12.994 --> 36:16.497
I'll take one of those
with the colored fragments on it.

36:18.785 --> 36:22.792
Did you see a young man about this tall,
dark hair, dark brown jacket,

36:23.014 --> 36:24.306
come in here earlier ?

36:26.030 --> 36:29.659
Look. That'll be
63 cents for the doughnut...

36:31.037 --> 36:34.624
and about, uh, 50 bucks
for the recollection.

36:38.310 --> 36:42.134
- What kind of an answer is that ?
- A minimum wage answer.

36:46.055 --> 36:47.597
You answer my question,

36:47.597 --> 36:49.810
or I'll personally see to it that
you spend the next millennium...

36:49.810 --> 36:52.214
chained to a damp wall
wondering just what it is...

36:52.214 --> 36:56.692
that's been winding its way up through
your bowels for the last 750 years.

37:00.627 --> 37:01.768
Cool.

37:17.961 --> 37:20.923
Look. The dude came in here
about a half an hour ago...

37:21.132 --> 37:24.456
and scarfed down about two dozen mixed
in less than five minutes.

37:24.456 --> 37:26.876
He was, like, on this serious
sugar rush, you know what I mean. ?

37:26.876 --> 37:29.448
Spontaneous tissue regeneration
tends to do that.

37:30.129 --> 37:32.200
- What ?
- Where is he now ?

37:33.111 --> 37:35.679
Oh.

37:51.086 --> 37:53.156
Hiding in shit...

37:54.068 --> 37:56.140
just like a monkey.

38:16.972 --> 38:19.043
No matter how many times you tell them,
they never seem to learn.

38:20.948 --> 38:24.674
You must always,
always remove the heart.

39:13.755 --> 39:16.653
Hey, hey, hey !

39:40.676 --> 39:42.746
- What are you ?
- Judgment.

39:57.615 --> 40:00.721
Don't push your luck.

40:05.567 --> 40:08.258
Ah. Ah ?

40:11.531 --> 40:14.306
Crazy me.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.584
Nice coat.

40:16.501 --> 40:18.571
Killing you
would be so easy.

40:18.531 --> 40:22.547
Yeah ? Fried food can kill me.
A mugger can kill me.

40:23.501 --> 40:25.572
You're not so special
down here, "Jones."

40:26.483 --> 40:28.553
How do you bear
what you've become, Gabriel ?

40:29.506 --> 40:33.275
You, who were once exalted
above all others.

40:33.482 --> 40:35.554
You been with a woman,
Zophael ? It's like dying.

40:36.464 --> 40:40.109
You moan and cry out.
You get to a spot...

40:40.441 --> 40:42.510
that has you
begging for release.

40:43.464 --> 40:46.859
Once,
I was an angel of death.

40:49.387 --> 40:53.113
Now, I die every day
when I have the cash.

40:55.392 --> 40:58.953
Enough about me.
You must be scared.

41:02.350 --> 41:05.329
What if you lose ?

41:06.326 --> 41:10.342
You must be scared you might
become like me, right ?

41:12.330 --> 41:14.941
Yes.

42:29.157 --> 42:33.249
My dying memory is being in your arms.

42:36.213 --> 42:39.887
I remember slipping away
and thinking,

42:41.221 --> 42:45.147
God, how lucky I was
to hold you one last time.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.530
But I... I kept slipping...

42:53.245 --> 42:55.332
until all around me
there were just bodies.

42:56.250 --> 42:59.340
I don't understand.

43:23.384 --> 43:25.473
No.

43:26.433 --> 43:28.520
Maggie, get out of here.

43:29.436 --> 43:32.819
- Get out !
- No, Danyael ! No !

43:39.456 --> 43:41.543
Maggie, get out of here.
- No ! No, Danyael ! Please.

43:42.461 --> 43:46.133
- Please don't go.
- Maggie, I said go !

44:28.673 --> 44:31.888
911.

44:47.750 --> 44:49.838
- How does it feel, Danyael,

44:50.756 --> 44:54.304
to know that
you're almost perfect ?

45:09.833 --> 45:14.050
- If not for the monkey inside you.

45:39.931 --> 45:43.397
- What am I to you. ?

45:45.984 --> 45:48.071
What is this ?

45:48.990 --> 45:52.997
I said, "What is this ?"
And why am I drawn to it ?

45:53.999 --> 45:56.714
Pyriel.

46:00.052 --> 46:02.681
Who ?

46:04.060 --> 46:07.191
The whited sepulcher.

46:08.068 --> 46:10.989
The next God.

46:54.279 --> 46:56.367
Help me, please.

46:57.284 --> 46:59.370
Come closer.

47:00.331 --> 47:02.418
I tried
to reason with him.

47:03.296 --> 47:05.383
I tried everything
I could.

47:05.299 --> 47:09.057
- Help's on the way.
- Good. That's good.

47:28.424 --> 47:31.681
There now.
That's better.

47:32.435 --> 47:35.647
Please.
Let me explain.

47:47.461 --> 47:49.548
- Looking for these ?

47:52.513 --> 47:54.599
- Take the car. You can have it.
- I'm afraid that won't do.

47:55.867 --> 47:58.660
After you.

48:00.872 --> 48:02.957
Yes, yes, I know.

48:03.316 --> 48:06.198
You keep a gun under  the front seat of
your car ever since you were robbed ...

48:06.390 --> 48:11.092
in that dark  cul-de-sac in that
very, very bad part of town.

48:11.921 --> 48:15.843
But the idea of actually
using it is a bit, what. ?

48:16.968 --> 48:19.763
Repulsive ?

48:19.972 --> 48:24.016
So therefore you
keep the bullets stashed safely...

48:24.976 --> 48:27.979
in the glove box.

48:29.980 --> 48:33.525
I'm not here to hurt you.
Promise.

49:05.135 --> 49:09.389
Earth angel, Earth angel .Hmm.

49:57.265 --> 50:00.893
Is this the best you can do ?

50:02.214 --> 50:06.547
- Do we have a problem ?
- Look, why do you even need me, huh ?

50:07.256 --> 50:09.339
Can't drive.

50:10.255 --> 50:13.630
I believe this
can go faster.

50:14.254 --> 50:17.421
Sure.
Whatever you say.

50:32.294 --> 50:35.835
We really don't
have time for this !

50:56.333 --> 50:59.040
Monkey.

51:03.374 --> 51:05.456
Good trick with the car.
I'll have to remember that.

51:07.373 --> 51:09.456
Jerk the wheel
to the right, and... wow.

51:10.414 --> 51:12.497
I swear to God,
I'll use this.

51:13.372 --> 51:15.455
I'm sure you will.

51:15.371 --> 51:17.454
- But why don't we just talk instead ?
- Don't !

51:19.371 --> 51:21.454
I said don't !

51:56.451 --> 51:58.533
- Fact. I am an angel.

51:59.448 --> 52:01.532
I'm also your friend.

52:01.664 --> 52:05.577
We can both help each other, but you're
going to have to be willing to listen to me.

52:05.614 --> 52:07.572
Are you ready
to listen ?

52:08.490 --> 52:10.572
I usually measure time in eons,
but in this particular case,

52:11.488 --> 52:13.572
every second counts.

52:13.530 --> 52:17.861
- Please. I told you, I'm not
here to hurt you.

52:29.569 --> 52:33.361
We both see things
the same way, you and I.

52:33.569 --> 52:35.652
A world abandoned
by the Creator.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.610
A universe in chaos.

52:38.568 --> 52:40.651
Danyael Rosales saw it too.
He saw it more clearly than any of us.

52:42.569 --> 52:44.650
But he's
lost his way now.

52:45.567 --> 52:50.359
He's been deceived by my brothers, who
still cling to old ways, old truths...

52:50.608 --> 52:52.691
who still harbor
some cold, empty faith...

52:53.607 --> 52:55.692
that our beloved Father
shall somehow return...

52:55.607 --> 52:57.689
and deliver us
from this wasteland,

52:58.606 --> 53:01.690
this killing field.

53:03.648 --> 53:07.524
But that will never,
never happen, Magdalena.

53:08.648 --> 53:11.856
You know it. I know it.

53:12.648 --> 53:16.355
And most ofall,
Danyael Rosales knew it.

53:16.689 --> 53:18.772
- Until now.
- Why ?

53:18.646 --> 53:22.311
Because he's being
driven by forces...

53:22.647 --> 53:24.729
beyond his control.

53:24.646 --> 53:28.729
- Where's he going ?
- He's going to stop our savior,

53:29.685 --> 53:31.770
the only one who can set things
right again with Heaven and Earth.

53:32.687 --> 53:35.393
Savior ?

53:39.685 --> 53:42.770
His name is Pyriel.

53:43.727 --> 53:47.058
It means "light of Heaven."

53:47.725 --> 53:49.808
He came here
in the first war,

53:50.725 --> 53:52.809
led the army ofGod that cast Lucifer
to a far more distant shore.

53:54.767 --> 53:57.974
And here he's remained.

53:58.766 --> 54:00.848
- Is he evil ?
- No, no.

54:01.724 --> 54:03.806
Evil is the realm
of darkness.

54:04.722 --> 54:06.806
Pyriel is the light.

54:07.764 --> 54:09.846
He is the shining beacon
that will lead us...

54:10.764 --> 54:12.848
from an eternity
of rotting despair...

54:13.764 --> 54:17.304
unless Danyael's there
to stop him.

54:17.804 --> 54:19.887
- Why would he do something like that ?
- Shh.

54:21.804 --> 54:24.595
Magdalena.

54:24.805 --> 54:29.012
We've always communicated
with your kind through voices.

54:29.803 --> 54:33.469
Voices. Voices
that make saints weep...

54:33.844 --> 54:35.927
and zealots kill.

54:35.844 --> 54:37.928
Voices that drive an angry mob
to incinerate a mother...

54:39.844 --> 54:41.926
desperately
shielding her little boy.

54:42.844 --> 54:46.841
It is those same voices
that now speak to Danyael.

54:49.842 --> 54:51.926
Danyael would never
listen to them.

54:51.842 --> 54:53.924
Whatever was human
in Danyael Rosales...

54:53.841 --> 54:55.924
died before he rose
from that morgue.

54:56.882 --> 54:58.965
He is no longer
your Danyael.

54:58.881 --> 55:00.966
You know it.

55:01.882 --> 55:03.966
You felt it.

55:03.883 --> 55:06.716
Didn't you ?

55:16.922 --> 55:20.172
Why should I
believe you ?

55:20.964 --> 55:24.045
'Cause you have to.

55:55.525 --> 55:57.594
Everywhere I go,
you're there.

55:57.512 --> 56:00.908
I close my eyes,
you're there.

56:06.456 --> 56:09.771
running from
his dead mama.

56:11.467 --> 56:13.538
Was the boy thinking...
Was he thinking about destiny ?

56:14.450 --> 56:16.520
Do you think he'll live
to see another day ?

56:17.431 --> 56:19.501
So many
who want him dead

56:19.419 --> 56:23.146
Yet he gets by.
Does he stop to wonder why. ?

56:29.400 --> 56:31.471
Does he think he might
be here for a purpose. ?

56:31.388 --> 56:33.458
Does he wonder
what that purpose is ?

56:34.370 --> 56:37.889
I do every moment
of my existence.

56:43.357 --> 56:47.622
Before you were born, I tried
to rip you from your mama's womb.

56:48.284 --> 56:50.357
I failed.
The Sword of Heaven...

56:51.308 --> 56:54.954
could not still
this tiny mortal heart.

56:55.285 --> 56:58.059
How come. ?

57:01.289 --> 57:03.359
It's not being here
that perplexes me.

57:04.272 --> 57:06.340
It's the not knowing.

57:07.252 --> 57:10.771
How come you ?
What could you mean ?

57:11.227 --> 57:14.210
Do you know who ?

57:15.246 --> 57:19.097
- Nothing.
- Clearly the facts say otherwise.

57:22.203 --> 57:24.273
You're the Word.

57:24.190 --> 57:26.262
Whatever it is you're destined
to commit upon this Earth,

57:28.165 --> 57:31.687
it's His will,
it's what He wants.

57:33.136 --> 57:35.206
No angel,
however powerful,

57:35.124 --> 57:37.195
can be anything
but the messenger.

57:37.112 --> 57:40.715
Danyael, you're a message,
and now...

57:42.122 --> 57:44.194
for the first time in a gazillion years,
l get to know what it is.

57:46.098 --> 57:49.619
I get to know
what that message is.

58:14.826 --> 58:16.911
Okay, I did my time
in Sunday school.

58:17.870 --> 58:19.955
If this Pyriel's like
the Second Coming or something,

58:21.875 --> 58:23.959
how come I don't
know anything about him ?

58:24.876 --> 58:28.588
Maybe you just
chose the wrong religion.

59:17.047 --> 59:20.258
I dreamed of you.

59:31.102 --> 59:33.187
I'm Mary.

59:33.144 --> 59:36.355
I know the enemy ghost.

59:41.111 --> 59:44.906
Last night I dreamed
the end of one history...

59:46.156 --> 59:49.494
and the beginning
of another.

59:50.159 --> 59:54.205
The darkness was met by the coming
of a great warrior.

59:57.167 --> 01:00:00.168
I dreamed ofyou.

01:00:03.212 --> 01:00:06.550
You look smaller
in person.

01:00:14.265 --> 01:00:17.600
<i>% Together
Flying for life %</i>

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:34.329
Tell me something.

01:00:35.385 --> 01:00:37.570
Do you still
love your God ?

01:00:40.587 --> 01:00:42.323
The truth.

01:00:45.334 --> 01:00:48.545
As much
as He loves me.

01:01:07.396 --> 01:01:11.855
Say, ma'am, I wonder if you
could tell me how to get to Gila Flats.

01:01:15.369 --> 01:01:19.501
Yeah, it's, um... It's over
on the Hualapai reservation.

01:01:20.326 --> 01:01:22.393
I don't suppose you could
be just a tad more specific,

01:01:24.293 --> 01:01:26.938
Madge.

01:01:29.293 --> 01:01:31.360
Where's your friend ?

01:01:31.276 --> 01:01:33.343
Oh, you
have a long memory.

01:01:34.251 --> 01:01:38.301
Rachel is, uh...
under the weather. She's bedridden.

01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:41.318
But I'll tell her
you inquired.

01:01:42.183 --> 01:01:45.655
- What do you want ?
- Everything.

01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:50.035
But to begin, I
need some coffee, fresh-brewed,

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.217
Sweet N Low,
non-dairy creamer,

01:01:54.124 --> 01:01:56.191
small grape fruit juice,
three eggs, yolks firm, not hard,

01:01:58.091 --> 01:02:00.157
bacon, crisp, hash browns,
dry wheat toast, butter on the side...

01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:04.784
and a portion of your
famous blackberry jam.

01:02:08.049 --> 01:02:11.271
It's gonna
be a long day.

01:02:13.514 --> 01:02:15.597
Remember, we're here to stop him,
that's all. And nobody gets hurt.

01:02:16.514 --> 01:02:18.596
- Go up the hill and turn.
- I suppose you caught his scent.

01:02:20.555 --> 01:02:23.680
Something like that.

01:02:34.556 --> 01:02:37.222
There.

01:02:38.556 --> 01:02:42.097
You've done well.
I'm proud of you.

01:02:43.597 --> 01:02:46.973
- Do not lose him.
- I won't !

01:03:00.641 --> 01:03:04.056
- Okay. Now what ?
- Go faster.

01:03:04.597 --> 01:03:07.807
What's that. ?

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.432
lgnore it.

01:03:32.724 --> 01:03:36.015
- Don't let up.
- I won't !

01:03:40.725 --> 01:03:43.517
Turn left.

01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:46.516
Hard left.

01:03:56.726 --> 01:03:58.808
I don't see him.

01:03:58.765 --> 01:04:01.601
He's there.

01:04:02.767 --> 01:04:05.433
Jesus !

01:04:10.807 --> 01:04:12.892
- Faster.
- We'll run him over !

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:15.892
- Exactly.
- I can't do that !

01:04:16.808 --> 01:04:18.892
I told you
what's at stake here.

01:04:18.808 --> 01:04:22.932
That wasn't the deal.
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

01:04:24.851 --> 01:04:26.934
How did you think we were going to
stop him, Magdalena ? With a prayer ?

01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:30.308
I don't know,
but not like this !

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.934
He's almost at the destination.
We have to kill him.

01:04:41.849 --> 01:04:43.935
- We have no choice.
- I do.

01:04:44.851 --> 01:04:49.603
- I'm warning you. - Whoeveryou are,
whateveryou are, I'm not afraid ofyou.

01:04:50.892 --> 01:04:53.809
You should be.

01:05:42.018 --> 01:05:44.102
She's still
in there, Danyael.

01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:48.018
Dying, I suspect.

01:05:49.018 --> 01:05:52.394
Not that
that really matters.

01:07:02.186 --> 01:07:05.811
So, this is what
it must feel like...

01:07:06.229 --> 01:07:08.313
to be human.

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:12.021
Not quite.

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:23.938
Maggie.

01:07:33.272 --> 01:07:36.438
- Danyael.
- I'm here.

01:07:37.272 --> 01:07:39.356
Look behind you. - What ?

01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:42.938
Aaah !

01:07:55.314 --> 01:07:57.981
Aaah !

01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:58.108
This is what it feels like
to be human.

01:09:38.568 --> 01:09:41.899
- Bring her back.
- I can't.

01:09:42.568 --> 01:09:46.276
- You have to.
- What are you afraid of ?

01:09:50.609 --> 01:09:54.485
- Nothing.
- Why so desperate to get her back ?

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:59.733
'Cause you know what Heaven's
gonna be like for her...

01:10:00.609 --> 01:10:04.150
if you don't finish
what you start.

01:11:00.736 --> 01:11:03.734
Are you an angel ?

01:11:07.777 --> 01:11:09.860
Once upon a time.

01:11:10.778 --> 01:11:14.571
- I don't want to die.
-  No.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.694
Who are you ?

01:11:24.821 --> 01:11:27.569
Gabriel.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.903
Hold my hand, Gabriel.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.529
Please.

01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:41.903
Oh, my God.

01:11:41.861 --> 01:11:45.154
I'm so afraid.

01:11:45.863 --> 01:11:48.863
Don't be afraid.

01:11:54.906 --> 01:11:58.570
- Where is Danyael ?
- He's fighting...

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:03.612
for you.

01:13:35.115 --> 01:13:37.199
The child
of divine fornication.

01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:40.198
What do you want
from me ?

01:13:41.115 --> 01:13:43.198
I have come
to help the monkeys perish...

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:46.198
by mutual slaughter...

01:13:46.115 --> 01:13:49.784
and then sow the Earth
with a better seed.

01:13:53.156 --> 01:13:55.949
Genocide.

01:13:56.158 --> 01:13:59.364
It happens
now and then.

01:14:11.199 --> 01:14:14.325
Turn away, nephalim.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.283
Blight not...

01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:19.283
and keep warm.

01:14:20.199 --> 01:14:22.282
Fuck you.

01:14:22.198 --> 01:14:25.743
There is no such thing
as destiny.

01:14:26.242 --> 01:14:29.616
You above all
should know that.

01:14:30.243 --> 01:14:32.325
What am I doing here ?

01:14:32.241 --> 01:14:35.783
The one thing your kind
excels at...

01:14:40.283 --> 01:14:42.950
dying.

01:15:20.367 --> 01:15:23.034
Aaah !

01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:32.872
It's not a mindless,
indifferent,

01:18:33.789 --> 01:18:36.999
blind universe, Danyael.

01:18:39.831 --> 01:18:42.750
It never was.

01:18:43.833 --> 01:18:46.789
Get used to it.

01:19:11.875 --> 01:19:14.500
Shh.

01:19:27.958 --> 01:19:30.041
ln the end there's still
The Word everywhere...

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:34.042
in Heaven and its angels,,
the Earth and the stars,

01:19:35.957 --> 01:19:39.666
even in the darkest part
of the human soul.

01:19:40.999 --> 01:19:44.624
It was there
The Word burned brightest.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.083
And for a moment,
I was blinded

01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:54.651
