00:51.017 --> 00:55.388
LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

SLIDE TO THE RIGHT.

01:21.081 --> 01:25.719
IN TIME --
YOU GUYS -- I LIKE TO SET A

01:25.719 --> 01:30.156
RECORD EVERY SHOW FOR HOW EARLY
WE CAN GET OFF THE RAILS.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.258

VERY EARLY.

01:32.258 --> 01:38.598
IN ADDITION TO THE STUDIO
AUDIENCE WE HAVE TARIK DAY IS.

01:38.598 --> 01:45.105
SAY HI TO THE AUDIENCE.
HI, AUDIENCE.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.108
[ CHEERS ]
I LIKE HIM, TOO.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.278
FUN FACT ABOUT TARIK HE WAS
KICKED OUT OF BOYS TO MEN

01:52.278 --> 01:55.915
BECAUSE HE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT.
NOT A WORD OF TRUTH.

01:55.915 --> 01:58.818
TONIGHT IS A VERY SPECIAL
NIGHT FOR TWO REASONS.

01:58.818 --> 02:02.489
ONE, IT'S OUR FIRST SHOW OF
2022.

02:02.489 --> 02:06.192
WE'VE BEEN ON HIATUS SINCE
DECEMBER, AND WE ARE SO GLAD TO

02:06.192 --> 02:09.929
BE BACK, BABY.
AND NUMBER TWO, IT'S BLACK

02:09.929 --> 02:16.302
HISTORY MONTH.
[ CHEERS ]

02:16.302 --> 02:18.371
YEAH.
I LIKE THAT, TOO.

02:18.371 --> 02:22.275
NOW, THERE ARE ONLY THREE DAYS
LEFT, BUT WE THINK THAT'S PLENTY

02:22.275 --> 02:25.211
OF TIME TO CELEBRATE.
SO WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT

02:25.211 --> 02:30.417
TONIGHT WITH A VERY SPECIAL
BLACK HISTORY MONTH EPISODE.

02:30.417 --> 02:35.588
WE HAVE 25 DAYS TO MAKE UP FOR.
SOUND GOOD?

02:35.588 --> 02:38.324
[ CHEERS ]
YES!

02:38.324 --> 02:41.661
BUT FIRST IT'S BEEN A CRAZY WEEK
IN AMERICA.

02:41.661 --> 02:46.766
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.
UKRAINE WAS ATTACKED THIS WEEK

02:46.766 --> 02:49.936
BY RUSSIAN FORCES, AND
REPUBLICANS KNOW JUST WHO TO

02:49.936 --> 02:55.375
BLAME FOR IT.
RUSSIA ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD

02:55.375 --> 03:00.080
DESTROYED MORE THAN 70 MILITARY
TARGETS IN UKRAINE WHICH IS A

03:00.080 --> 03:06.519
WEIRD THING, BUT PUTIN IS KNOWN
FOR FLEXING.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.255
OR HORSE --
THE "HOLLYWOOD REPORTER"

03:09.255 --> 03:13.793
PUBLISHED A LIST THIS WEEK OF
THE 24 BEST PRESIDENTS IN FILM

03:13.793 --> 03:17.564
AND TV WHICH INCLUDED MORGAN
FREEMAN IN "DEEP IMPACT" AND

03:17.564 --> 03:24.237
CHRIS ROCK IN "HEAD OF STATE."
AND PRESIDENT BIDEN IN THIS FILM

03:24.237 --> 03:36.916
--
[ LAUGHTER ]

03:36.916 --> 03:42.489
MY GOSH.
YOU GUYS -- YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE

03:42.489 --> 03:45.392
TO PLAY THE AMOUNT THAT THIS
ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

03:45.392 --> 03:50.230
IT WENT ON FOR SO LONG.
GUYS -- YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND

03:50.230 --> 03:53.933
TAKE A LOOK FOR THAT CLIP EVERY
[ BLEEP ] NEVER GET ENOUGH OF

03:53.933 --> 03:56.302
IT.
YES.

03:56.302 --> 03:59.205
TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT ON
TUESDAY ORDERED THE STATE'S

03:59.205 --> 04:03.243
CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO
INVESTIGATE ALL TRANS CHILDREN

04:03.243 --> 04:06.446
AND TO PROSECUTE THEIR PARENTS
AS CHILD ABUSERS.

04:06.446 --> 04:12.519
HE ALSO ORDERED THE GENERAL
PUBLIC TO START REPORTING ANY

04:12.519 --> 04:14.954
TRANSGENDER CHILDREN THEY SEE.
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.624
THE LAW SAYS EVERYONE IN TEXAS
HAS TO START REPORTING TRANS

04:17.624 --> 04:20.460
KIDS TO AUTHORITIES, SO IT'S
ONLY RIGHT THAT WE GIVE YOU TIPS

04:20.460 --> 04:26.332
ON HOW TO IDENTIFY ANY TRANS
CHILDREN THAT MIGHT BE IN YOUR

04:26.332 --> 04:27.067
MIDST.
**

04:27.067 --> 04:32.072
TIP NUMBER ONE -- THE CHILDREN,
KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR ANYONE

04:32.072 --> 04:35.742
SHORT, VULNERABLE, AND IN NO WAY
A THREAT TO YOU WHATSOEVER.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.078
IF YOU SEE SOMEONE THAT FITS
THIS DESCRIPTION, THERE'S A REAL

04:38.078 --> 04:40.080
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY ARE A
TRANS CHILD.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.784
CALL THE COPS!
TIP NUMBER TWO -- THEY LOOK AND

04:44.784 --> 04:48.488
ACT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
SO IF YOU SEE A CHILD ACTING

04:48.488 --> 04:52.158
TOTALLY NORMAL, THERE'S A CHANCE
THEY'RE TRANS.

04:52.158 --> 05:00.300
WARNING SIGNS MAY INCLUDE
PLAYING HOP SCOTCH, GIVING COOTY

05:00.300 --> 05:04.037
SHOT, AND HAVE A DIMPLE.
IF YOU SEE A CHILD WITH THESE

05:04.037 --> 05:06.906
THINGS, CALL 911.
TIP NUMBER THREE, THEY ARE

05:06.906 --> 05:08.274
AFRAID.
TRANS PEOPLE HAVE A NEARLY ONE

05:08.274 --> 05:11.478
IN TEN CHANCE OF BEING
PHYSICALLY ATTACKED IN ANY GIVEN

05:11.478 --> 05:14.347
YEAR.
THAT'S A REAL FEAR THEY CARRY

05:14.347 --> 05:18.418
WITH THEM EVERY DAY.
IF YOU SEE A TRANS KID, MAKE

05:18.418 --> 05:20.954
THINGS WORSE FOR THEM AND CALL
THE FBI.

05:20.954 --> 05:27.861
TIP NUMBER FOUR, THEY'RE
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS,

05:27.861 --> 05:33.133
TRANSGENDER AND LGBTQ KIDS MAKE
UP 20 TO 40% OF HOMELESS KIDS IN

05:33.133 --> 05:35.935
OUR COUNTRY.
IF YOU SEE A CHILD STRUGGLING TO

05:35.935 --> 05:38.772
FIND HOUSING, DO WHAT JESUS
WOULD DO, CALL THE S.W.A.T.

05:38.772 --> 05:44.277
TEAM.
THEY'RE TIRED OF YOUR --

05:44.277 --> 05:49.949
[ APPLAUSE ]
TRANS KIDS ARE ALL DIFFERENT,

05:49.949 --> 05:52.085
UNIQUE, PERFECT HUMAN BEINGS,
BUT THEY ALL HAVE ONE THING IN

05:52.085 --> 05:55.088
COMMON -- THEY'RE TIRED OF
HATEFUL ADULTS INSERTING

05:55.088 --> 05:59.759
THEMSELVES INTO THEIR BUSINESS.
SO IF YOU SEE A CHILD WHO SEEMS

05:59.759 --> 06:02.629
EXHAUSTED BY YOUR -- IT IS
POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE TRANS.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.199
CALL YOUR CONGRESS PERSON.
TELL THEM TO CALL THE PRESIDENT

06:06.199 --> 06:12.272
BECAUSE THAT'S A CODE RED.
[ APPLAUSE ]

06:12.272 --> 06:15.542
HEY, MAKE SURE TO DO IT NOW
BEFORE YOU REALIZE HOW UTTERLY

06:15.542 --> 06:19.946
OBSOLETE YOU ARE AND HOW THE
WORLD HAS MOVED PAST THIS NEED

06:19.946 --> 06:23.283
FOR YOU.
OR YOU COULD [ BLEEP ] OFF.

06:23.283 --> 06:31.424
BACK TO THE MONOLOGUE.
[ CHEERS ]

06:31.424 --> 06:33.393
I HURT MY HAND WHEN I WAS
POUNDING --

06:33.393 --> 06:37.130
IT WAS SO GREAT.
I WAS IMPASSIONED.

06:37.130 --> 06:41.101
I BELIEVED YOU.
BABY.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.738
GO AHEAD -- RECENTLY A NEW
VERSION OF A SO-CALLED DARK MODE

06:44.738 --> 06:47.507
ROLLED OUT THAT CHANGES THE
THEME FROM DARK GRAY TO TRUE

06:47.507 --> 06:49.476
BLACK.
NOW YOU CAN TELL IF YOU'RE IN

06:49.476 --> 06:55.682
TRUE BLACK BECAUSE YOUR SCREEN
WILL LOOK LIKE THIS.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.317
IT'S BLACK.
YOU KNOW --

06:57.317 --> 07:05.258
TRUE BLACK.
THAT'S NANCY PELOSI'S SCREEN.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.826
TARIK --
SLIDE TO THE LEFT.

07:06.826 --> 07:10.830
SLIDE TO THE RIGHT.
IT CRISS-CROSS.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.368
ACCORDING TO A NEW SURVEY, 30%
OF AMERICANS SAID THEY DON'T

07:15.368 --> 07:25.779
ENJOY GOSSIPING AT ALL, SO THE
OTHER 60%, WHAT IS THEIR DEAL?

07:25.779 --> 07:29.282
THE KIDS ANIMATED SERIES
"ARTHUR" ENDED THIS WEEK AFTER

07:29.282 --> 07:31.384
25 YEARS.
IT TAUGHT KIDS PRETTY MUCH

07:31.384 --> 07:37.424
EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHAT AN
AARDVARK LOOKS LIKE.

07:37.424 --> 07:43.863
[ BLEEP ]
GEORGE WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY

07:43.863 --> 07:49.102
WAS THIS WEEK.
CELEBRATE BY BEING A TERRIBLE

07:49.102 --> 07:54.407
PERSON AND -- AN ANECDOTE ABOUT
A CHERRY TREE.

07:54.407 --> 07:58.378
I SAID ANTIDOTE.
YOU SAY IT.

07:58.378 --> 08:02.248
I THOUGHT ANTIDOTE IS WHAT YOU
TAKE IF YOU'RE POISONED.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.017
THAT'S ANTIDOTE.
ANECDOTE.

08:04.017 --> 08:07.087
WAS I POISONED?
THERE'S ONLY ONE CURE.

08:07.087 --> 08:10.190
SLIDE TO THE LEFT.
SLIDE TO THE RIGHT.

08:10.190 --> 08:14.327
AND FINALLY, AUTHORITIES IN
DENMARK ASKED THE PUBLIC THIS

08:14.327 --> 08:16.930
WEEK FOR HELP LOCATING A LOOSE
KANGAROO.

08:16.930 --> 08:23.303
SO IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN A LOOSE
KANGAROO, HERE'S ONE.

08:23.303 --> 08:27.941
[ LAUGHTER ]
AND THAT WAS THE MONOLOGUE.

08:27.941 --> 08:32.512
DID YOU GUYS LIKE THE MONOLOGUE?
[ CHEERS ]

08:32.512 --> 08:34.047
YEAH.
GOOD.

08:34.047 --> 08:38.418
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT BECAUSE WE
HAVE A NO-RETURN POLICY.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.388
NOW, THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY
PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

08:41.388 --> 08:43.323
BLACK HISTORY IN REALLY BIG
WAYS.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.326
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THEIR NAMES,
BUT I WANT TO KICK OFF OUR

08:46.326 --> 08:49.162
CELEBRATION TONIGHT BY TAKING A
MOMENT TO CELEBRATE SOME LESSER

08:49.162 --> 08:53.333

OLYMPICS.

09:09.015 --> 09:12.452

FRONT OF OUR EYES.
BLACK HISTORY, BABY!

09:39.846 --> 09:44.050

FIGHT AND HIS MOM GOT SCARED AND
SAID YOU'RE MOVING WITH YOUR

09:47.354 --> 09:50.123
AUNTIE AND UFRGLE TO BEL AIR.
THAT'S THE CHARACTER FROM THE

09:50.123 --> 09:52.726

HE WAS ALSO THE FIRST PRINCE

14:03.743 --> 14:06.279
* YOU'VE DONE YOUR BEST WE'RE SO
IMPRESSED

14:06.279 --> 14:11.151
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START *
* WHEN YOU ENJOY I GOT TO SAY OH

14:11.151 --> 14:15.555
BOY
IT FILLS UP MY HEART *

14:15.555 --> 14:18.792
* COOL HUH *
YEAH.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.361
REALLY COOL.
**

14:21.361 --> 14:25.932
* IT'S HOW YOU SPELL I THINK
YOU'RE THE GREATEST

14:25.932 --> 14:34.941
THAT YOU ARE THE GREATEST *
* WE THINK YOU'RE THE GREATEST

[ APPLAUSE ]

14:35.842 --> 14:40.714
YOU THINK SHE'LL SEE THIS?
SHE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.850
IT'S ON PAST HER BEDTIME.
YOU'RE A GROWN-UP, SO STICK

14:43.850 --> 14:55.528
AROUND AND WE'LL BE BACK WITH
MORE "AMBER RUFFIN SHOW."

14:58.732 --> 15:01.468

WELCOME BACK TO THE "AMBER

15:01.468 --> 15:04.938
RUFFIN SHOW."
DAN PATRICK VOWED TO END TENURE

15:04.938 --> 15:09.042
FOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR
TO THEECH CRITICAL RACE THEORY

15:09.042 --> 15:13.446
IN THE CLASSROOM.
HE TWEETED WE PUBLICLY FUNDED K

15:13.446 --> 15:16.783
THROUGH 12 AND WILL PUBLICLY
FUND IT IN HIGHER ED.

15:16.783 --> 15:22.455
THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST RECENT
EXAMPLES OF REFUSALS TO EDUCATE

15:22.455 --> 15:24.257
STUDENTS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF
BEING WHITE IN THIS COUNTRY.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.060
IF THEY WON'T LET SCHOOLS TEACH
THAT LESSON, I GUESS I HAVE TO

15:27.060 --> 15:30.964
TEACH IT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.
IN A LITTLE SEGMENT CALLED --

15:30.964 --> 15:36.970
"THE ABCs OF WHITE PRIVILEGE."
[ APPLAUSE ]

15:36.970 --> 15:39.939
THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN, SO
LET'S GET STARTED.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.475
A IS FOR ASSIMILATION.
ASSIMILATION IS WHEN PEOPLE OF

15:42.475 --> 15:45.612
COLOR HAVE TO ADJUST NATURAL
THINGS ABOUT THEMSELVES TO MAKE

15:45.612 --> 15:48.948
WHITE PEOPLE COMFORTABLE.
THIS INCLUDES CODE SWITCHING,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.451
STRAIGHTENING OUR HAIR, AND
SAYING THE BEATLES ARE GOOD.

15:51.451 --> 15:56.089
I'M SORRY, THEY STINK, AND
THEY'RE NOT CUTE.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.793
B IS FOR BAND-AIDS, BEING NUDE,
AND NOT JUST BAND-AIDS.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.395
DID YOU KNOW THAT UNTIL RECENTLY
BLACK DANCERS COULDN'T FIND

16:02.395 --> 16:05.432
TIGHTS OR BALLET SHOE THAT'S
MATCHED THEIR SKIN TONE?

16:05.432 --> 16:10.370
THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE WERE
NUDE, BUT WHO NUDE IS THAT?

16:10.370 --> 16:12.272
THAT'S NOT WHAT I LOOK LIKE
NAKED.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.609
I LOOK LIKE THIS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

16:16.609 --> 16:17.544
SEE?
SEE?

16:17.544 --> 16:23.216
FOR COLONIZATION, EUROPEANS CAME
TO NORTH AMERICA AND STOLE THE

16:23.216 --> 16:26.586
LAND FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.
WE'VE BEEN TAUGHT THAT EUROPEANS

16:26.586 --> 16:30.323
WERE BRAVE EXPLORERS WHEN THE
ONLY THING THEY DISCOVERED WAS

16:30.323 --> 16:32.225
SYPHILIS.
THAT'S GREAT.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.828
I THINK THE AUDIENCE LEARNED A
LOT.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.764
D IS FOR THE DOG PACK --
THERE'S MORE.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.101
THERE IS MORE.
THE DOG PACK.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.604
IN THE 1940s, THERE WAS A TEST
IN COME BLACK CHILDREN WERE

16:44.604 --> 16:46.172
PRESENTED WITH DOLLS OF
DIFFERENT COLORS.

16:46.172 --> 16:49.709
THEIR STUDY SHOWED THAT MOST
CHILDREN ATTRIBUTED POSITIVE

16:49.709 --> 16:53.780
CHARACTERISTICS TO WHITE DOLLS
BECAUSE OF SOCIETAL PERCEPTIONS.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.282
SAD, RIGHT?
BUT IF YOU ASK ME, BARBIE WISHES

16:56.282 --> 17:02.155
SHE WAS AS FLY AS KRISTI.
E IS FOR EMOTIONAL TEXTS.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.857
THEY SHOULD CALL THAT PHYSICAL
TEXTS.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.593
I HAVE BROKEN MY BACK DRAGGING
WHITE PEOPLE INTO THE LIGHT, AND

17:06.593 --> 17:09.863
I'M SICK OF IT.
IT TAKES ITS TOLL EMOTIONALLY.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.566
OH, THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM.
F IS FOR BEING FOLLOWED AROUND

17:13.566 --> 17:16.336
STORES.
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, WALGREENS.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.606
G IS FOR GERRYMANDERING, THE ACT
OF MANIPULATING CONGRESSIONAL

17:19.606 --> 17:22.542
BOUNDARIES IN FAVOR OF A
SPECIFIC POLITICAL PARTY.

17:22.542 --> 17:27.347
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS RACIST --
YOU DID THE WHOLE ALPHABET.

17:27.347 --> 17:30.350
H IS FOR SOMETHING WE CAN'T
GET -- GOOD HEALTH CARE.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.286
BLACK WOMEN ARE THREE TO FOUR
TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM

17:33.286 --> 17:36.089
PREGNANCY-RELATED CAUSES THAN
WHITE WOMEN JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE

17:36.089 --> 17:39.059
BLACK.
AND THAT'S JUST PREGNANCY.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.327
YOU KNOW THEY'RE [ BLEEP ]
EVERYTHING ELSE.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.698
I IS FOR IMPLICIT BIAS.
THAT'S WHEN WE ATTRIBUTE

17:44.698 --> 17:46.199
STEREOTYPES WITHOUT OUR
CONSCIOUS KNOWLEDGE.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.902
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE -- CROSSING
THE STREET WHEN YOU SEE A BLACK

17:48.902 --> 17:53.239
GUY BUT NOT WHEN YOU SEE A WHITE
GUY EVEN THOUGH BOTH MEN CAN AND

17:53.239 --> 17:58.078
WILL KILL YOU DEAD, AND THAT'S
AN IMPLICIT BIAS I HAVE ABOUT

17:58.078 --> 18:00.880
MEN.
HEY, YOU -- YOU KNOW THE

18:00.880 --> 18:03.550
SHOW'S ONLY 22 MINUTES LONG,
RIGHT?

18:03.550 --> 18:07.921
J IS FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL.
ALL WHITE PEOPLE.

18:07.921 --> 18:11.791
THE ACLU FOUND THAT BLACK PEOPLE
WERE 3.7 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE

18:11.791 --> 18:14.294
ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA
POSSESSION THAN WHITE PEOPLE,

18:14.294 --> 18:17.030
EVEN THOUGH THEIR RATE OF
MARIJUANA USAGE WAS COMPARABLE.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.733
THEY SAY JUSTICE IS FOR
EVERYONE, BUT IT'S REALLY JUST

18:19.733 --> 18:24.738
FOR WHITE PEOPLE LIKE THE F90.
WE'VE GOT TO SPEED THIS UP.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.206
FINE.
BUCKLE UP.

18:26.206 --> 18:30.844
K IS FOR CARE TIN.
L IS FOR LAWS WHITE PEOPLE HAVE

18:30.844 --> 18:34.748
WRITTEN FOR US BY US.
M IS MORE MICROAGGRESSIONS.

18:34.748 --> 18:38.485
CALLING ANYTHING GHETTO, ASKING
IF WE WORK HERE, OR IS THAT YOUR

18:38.485 --> 18:40.520
REAL HAIR?
THE RECEIPT SAID IT'S MINE.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.690
BACK OFF.
N IS FOR NANO AGGRESSIONS WHICH

18:43.690 --> 18:46.092
ARE JUST ITTY BITTY
MICROAGGRESSIONS.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.162
O IS FOR OPPRESSION WHICH IS
ALSO THE NAME OF MITCH

18:49.162 --> 18:54.968
McCONNELL'S COLOGNE.
OPPRESSION FOR MEN AVAILABLE AT

18:54.968 --> 18:58.138
WALMART NEXT TO THE GUNS.
[ LAUGHTER ]

18:58.138 --> 19:02.275
P IS FOR POLICE BRUTALITY WHICH
WE ALL KNOW DISPROPORTIONATELY

19:02.275 --> 19:05.178
AFFECTS PEOPLE OF COLOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE

19:05.178 --> 19:07.580
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS
PEOPLE OF COLOR?

19:07.580 --> 19:12.085
JUVENILES, BACK THAT UP.
LIKE BLACK PEOPLE WE --

19:12.085 --> 19:13.920
NO, WE DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR
THIS.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.490
WHY NOT?
Q IS FOR BEING QUALIFIED BUT

19:17.490 --> 19:20.260
UNDERPAID AND UNDEREMPLOYED.
R IS FOR REPARATIONS.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.897
WE'VE ASKED IN EVERY WAY
POSSIBLE, EVEN VENMO.

19:23.897 --> 19:27.834
WRITE ME MY CHECK.
U -- WE DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT THE

19:27.834 --> 19:30.136
MULE.
S IS FOR SAVIOR COMPLEX.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.039
WHEN WHITE ALLIES FEEL LIKE THEY
ARE GOD'S GIFT TO BLACK PEOPLE

19:33.039 --> 19:36.142
WHEN WE ALL KNOW GOD'S REAL GIFT
TO BLACK PEOPLE IS RHYTHM.

19:36.142 --> 19:38.478
NO!
NO!

19:38.478 --> 19:40.413
NO.
OKAY.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.148
FINE.
T IS MORE TOKENISM.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.918
THAT'S THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN
ONLY HAVE ONE MODEL MINORITY IN

19:44.918 --> 19:47.721
A GROUP OF WHITE PEOPLE.
THIS PRACTICE IS USED TO PIT

19:47.721 --> 19:50.457
MINORITY GROUPS AGAINST EACH
OTHER IN AN EFFORT FOR THEM TO

19:50.457 --> 19:54.427
EXCEL IN WHITE SPACES.
THIS IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH

19:54.427 --> 19:57.497
-- THERE ARE NO MINORITIES IN
ANY "LORD OF THE RINGS" MOVIES

19:57.497 --> 19:58.965
AT ALL.
AMBER!

19:58.965 --> 20:02.635
AMBER?
OKAY.

20:02.635 --> 20:08.141
U, V, W, THEY'RE FOR UPHOLDING
VALUES OF WHITENESS.

20:08.141 --> 20:11.344
WHITE IS ALWAYS RIGHT IS
INGRAINED TO THE FABRIC OF THE

20:11.344 --> 20:14.748
COUNTRY WHEN IN REALITY THE ONLY
THING THAT IS RIGHT IS THE PRICE

20:14.748 --> 20:21.121
AND 90 DEGREE ANGELS.
X IS FOR XENOPHOBIA.

20:21.121 --> 20:25.025
Y IS ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT THE
RACIST PAST AND MOVING INTO A

20:25.025 --> 20:26.960
DAY WHEN EQUITY AND INCLUSION
ARE THE UNDERSTOOD NORM.

20:26.960 --> 20:36.269
AND Z IS FOR ZEPRA.
WE MADE IT.

20:36.269 --> 20:39.673
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT?
OH, WELL, I GUESS WE DON'T KNOW

20:39.673 --> 20:44.110

DO KNOW --

ARE YOU READY?
YEP.

21:25.985 --> 21:29.622
OKAY.
SO I'LL GO FIRST.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.258
DID YOU KNOW THAT POLAR BEARS'
FUR ISN'T WHITE?

21:32.258 --> 21:35.428
IT'S SEE THROUGH AND REFLECTS
THE LIGHT MAKING IT SEEM WHITE.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.163
HOW COOL.
YEAH.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.734
ARE THEY A PREDATOR OR OPTICAL
ILLUSION?

21:40.734 --> 21:43.169
THEY'RE BOTH.
DID YOU KNOW THAT BATS ARE

21:43.169 --> 21:48.641
THE ONLY MAMMAL THAT CAN FLY?
IF YOU DON'T COUNT SUPERMAN.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.277
HEY, DID YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST
VIOLENT INCIDENT IN THE CIVIL

21:51.277 --> 21:54.014
RIGHTS ERA IS SOMETHING MOST OF
US HAVE NEVER HEARD OF?

21:54.014 --> 21:58.218
ON THE CAMPUS OF SOUTH CAROLINA
STATE UNIVERSITY IN 1968, STATE

21:58.218 --> 22:02.288
TROOPERS SHOT 28 STUDENT
PROTESTERS, AND THERE WAS NO

22:02.288 --> 22:06.693
FORMAL INVESTIGATION.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.628
NO.
I DIDN'T.

22:08.628 --> 22:13.266
DID YOU KNOW THAT CANADA IS
ACTUALLY SOUTH OF DETROIT?

22:13.266 --> 22:14.901

I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT A

22:14.901 --> 22:16.469
MAP.
YEAH.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.739
DID YOU KNOW THAT ONE QUARTER
OF THE FIRST 33 BLACK MEN

22:19.739 --> 22:23.810
ELECTED TO GEORGIA'S LEGISLATURE
WERE THREATENED, BEATEN, OR

22:23.810 --> 22:27.614
KILLED BY WHITE PROTESTERS?
NO.

22:27.614 --> 22:30.750
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE FIRST
FOOTPRINTS ON THE MOON WILL BE

22:30.750 --> 22:34.087
THERE FOR A MILLION YEARS?
COOL!

22:34.087 --> 22:37.090
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LONG
AND RICH HISTORY OF BLACK

22:37.090 --> 22:39.959
JOURNALISM IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT
THERE ARE ABOUT 25 BLACK-OWNED

22:39.959 --> 22:44.097
PAPERS FROM THE LATE 18 AND
EARLY 1900s THAT HAVE NO

22:44.097 --> 22:45.532
REMAINING COPIES?
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE REASON FOR

22:45.532 --> 22:48.401
THAT IS USUALLY BECAUSE THE
NEWSPAPER OFFICES WERE DESTROYED

22:48.401 --> 22:52.005
BY ANGRY WHITE MOBS?
DID YOU KNOW, DID YOU KNOW, DID

22:52.005 --> 22:55.575
YOU KNOW THAT?
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN

22:55.575 --> 22:58.578
FACTS, RIGHT?
YEAH.

22:58.578 --> 23:04.050
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE MINE
ARE FUN, BUT YOURS ARE TRULY

23:04.050 --> 23:05.318
TERRIFYING.
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

23:05.318 --> 23:09.055
HOW ABOUT THIS -- DID YOU KNOW
THAT MORE PEOPLE VISIT FRANCE

23:09.055 --> 23:10.190
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD?

23:10.190 --> 23:12.592
I DIDN'T.
IT MUST BE BECAUSE PARIS IS THE

23:12.592 --> 23:16.129
CITY OF LOVE.
WHAT I DON'T LOVE, THOUGH, IS

23:16.129 --> 23:19.399
THE FACT THAT THE FIRST
UNIVERSITY OWNED AND OPERATED BY

23:19.399 --> 23:22.469
AFRICAN AMERICANS HAS BEEN
BURNED TO THE GROUND BY RACIAL

23:22.469 --> 23:24.738
TERRORISTS TWICE.
ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY IN

23:24.738 --> 23:27.741
TENNESSEE WAS ALSO BURNED DOWN
TWO TIMES BEFORE IT FINALLY

23:27.741 --> 23:31.544
CLOSED.
AND IT'S NOT JUST COLLEGES -- IN

23:31.544 --> 23:35.448
1910 WHITE RIOTERS BURNED DOWN
EVERY BLACK SCHOOL IN NEW

23:35.448 --> 23:37.884
ORLEANS.
AND THE CITY DIDN'T HAVE A BLACK

23:37.884 --> 23:41.654
SCHOOL FOR 17 YEARS.
THAT IS NOT FUN.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.491
BUT IT IS A FACT.
OKAY.

23:44.491 --> 23:48.161
BUT I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO
BE LIKE A FUN, LIGHT-HEARTED

23:48.161 --> 23:50.296
SEGMENT.
TARIK, AS BLACK PEOPLE LIVING

23:50.296 --> 23:56.770
IN AMERICA, WE DON'T HAVE THE
LUXURY OF BEING LIGHTHEARTED.

23:56.770 --> 24:02.609
NOW THAT'S A FACT.
IN HAS BEEN "DID YOU KNOW?"

24:02.609 --> 24:09.315
.
WE ALSO HAVE PEOPLE WE WANT

24:09.315 --> 24:12.819
TO LIFT UP THIS BLACK HISTORY
MONTH BUT MISSED ONE PERSON --

24:12.819 --> 24:15.422
YOU.
IN THIS COUNTRY, IN THIS

24:15.422 --> 24:17.724

GIVE UP.

24:17.724 --> 24:20.794
BUT GUESS WHAT -- YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

24:20.794 --> 24:24.464
YOU'RE STRONG, YOU GOT YOUR
HAIR BRAIDED AND DIDN'T SHED A

STARTED YOUR DAY OFF AS IF THIS
COUNTRY IS GOING TO DO YOU

24:31.137 --> 24:33.873

IT'S NOT.
