-Wait!

00:03.000 --> 00:05.420
-This will not help our tribes.
-You know nothing about it.

00:05.420 --> 00:07.080
I will put an end
to these humans,

00:07.080 --> 00:09.290
and to you
if you interfere.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.960
[Ryn]
Tia wants to rule us.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.210
The tribe is violent.

00:12.210 --> 00:13.540
You must go back to the water,

00:13.540 --> 00:15.170
defend our territory.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.880
These things, nobody knows
anything about them.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.000
I do. I've seen what
their cells can do for Ma.

[Ted]
Your mother's not a guinea pig.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.330
[Ben] What if I could prove
that we're safe?

00:23.330 --> 00:25.330
Your baby, she's alive.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.000
What are you talking about?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.500
[Leena] We implanted
one of her embryos

00:28.500 --> 00:30.420
in a female hybrid.

00:30.420 --> 00:32.580
-Where is she?
-I'm so sorry.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.000
We shouldn't have done it.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.670
Focus. You let every
mistake in life throw you,

00:36.670 --> 00:38.420
you'll never get over it.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.920
Ryn, you should know,

00:39.920 --> 00:42.330
I saw Sarge again.
I went to the water.

00:42.330 --> 00:45.880
He told me,
war is coming.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.330

Hey, hey, hey.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.790
He's gone.

01:26.830 --> 01:29.880
Do you, like, have any idea
how messed up this is?

01:29.880 --> 01:31.170
No.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.420
No, you don't.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.210
You have got to get
your shit under control.

01:37.210 --> 01:39.000
I protect the baby.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.750
We have to get out of here now,
before the others find out.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.040
The others?

01:43.040 --> 01:45.460
His followers wanted
a pure-blood baby.

01:45.460 --> 01:47.750
Why?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.210
To worship it.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.540
Okay, that's not weird at all.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.290
We need to take Meredith
somewhere safe.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.380
Somewhere they won't
come looking for her.

01:55.380 --> 01:58.290
We can take her
to my place for now.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.920
-What about him?
-He should be brought
to the ranch.

02:00.920 --> 02:04.000
We have rituals, ways of dealing
with our own dead

02:04.000 --> 02:05.790
so we don't have to bring in
the outside world.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.540
Meredith needs to go.

02:07.540 --> 02:09.670
Okay, we can take Meredith.
You take the body to the ranch.

02:09.670 --> 02:12.330
I have to stay with Meredith.
Her condition is too fragile.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.880
I'll deal with him.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.750
[Leena] They'll never
let you on the ranch.

-[Xander] I'll figure it out.

named Meredith?

She was one of the people
at the ranch.

Why? What about her?

She's pregnant

Leena implanted it
in a surrogate.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.500
Her name is Meredith.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.500
Does Ryn know about this?
Where is she?

04:48.500 --> 04:49.960
Yes. She's with me.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.500

that he was putting
Ryn's baby in danger.

everything to them.

on our little secret,

these creatures

back there.

a bad decision.

wish I understood

08:46.420 --> 08:48.000
why these creatures
do what they do.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.580
They have a different
moral code than we do.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.330
You think?
You call that moral?

08:53.330 --> 08:55.080
It's primal nature.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.330
It's pure.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.750
Sometimes enviable.

Yeah.

-How is she?

This pregnancy,
it's not normal.

09:43.330 --> 09:44.790
She's pretty far along.

09:44.790 --> 09:46.380
Yeah, I wasn't
expecting normal.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.830
She's already had
a bout of false labor,

09:47.830 --> 09:49.080
and Ryn felt it.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.670
-What?
-Yeah.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.620
But it stopped once
she was near Meredith.

09:52.620 --> 09:55.830
It was like the baby calmed
as soon as Ryn got close.

09:57.170 --> 09:58.670
What happened to your hand?

09:58.670 --> 09:59.920
It's fine.

in that house.

of pregnancy she's in.

the baby's in.

risen again.

-We need to get her
into an ice bath

11:30.000 --> 11:32.580
to stabilize core temperature
before it damages the fetus.

into the world

11:46.000 --> 11:47.540
and then was killed by one.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.830
He was a fanatic.

That generally leads one
to dark ends.

of taking care of our dead.

physical deviations

12:54.790 --> 12:59.750
which could raise questions in
an autopsy or at a funeral home.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.830
There will be no remains.

13:02.830 --> 13:04.580

want this coming back

13:50.500 --> 13:51.830
With two B's.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.080
Right. How did you know that?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.120
Maddie showed me
your website.

13:56.120 --> 13:58.000
Oh. Cool. Ben, right?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.620
Yeah.

13:59.620 --> 14:01.250
Just one B.

14:02.380 --> 14:03.750
I work with Maddie.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.250
Great.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.750
She's an amazing person.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.620
[Ben] So you two met
in Seattle, right?

14:15.620 --> 14:17.460
[Robb]
Yes. Yeah.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.000
Where are you headed now?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.380
Well, I was hoping
to go say hi to Maddie.

14:23.380 --> 14:27.620
No, no, I meant after
Bristol Cove.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.000
Oh, I'm planning a trip
to the Indian Ocean.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.620
We have a cleanup crew out
there, they're waiting--

14:32.620 --> 14:34.330
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.290
You're still here.
Thought you were flying out.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.620
Wow, lots of interest
in my travel plans.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.710
You two working undercover
for Homeland Security?

14:45.330 --> 14:46.920
I postponed the trip

14:46.920 --> 14:48.250
so I could spend a little
more time with you.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.460
Oh, I'm so sorry, I can't.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.120
Oh.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.790
We have a lot going on
at the research center.

14:55.790 --> 14:58.170
Yeah, I got
to get over there.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.290
Good seeing you, Robb.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.330
Be right there.
I just have to--

15:02.330 --> 15:03.830
Do that thing.

15:03.830 --> 15:05.170
Yeah, the thing
in my apartment.

15:05.170 --> 15:06.830
[laughs]

15:06.830 --> 15:08.710
I should've called
or texted.

15:08.710 --> 15:10.500
I thought it'd be
a cool surprise.

15:10.500 --> 15:13.790
Oh, it is.
It is, on any other day.

15:13.790 --> 15:17.500
I get it. You got a thing
in your apartment.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.040
It's a weird day.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.920
But don't give up on me.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.880
I'm really glad
you stuck around.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.330
Me too.

15:27.330 --> 15:28.540
Okay.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.120
I think.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.620
[door closes]

15:37.790 --> 15:39.250
-[Leena] Careful.
-What's happening?

15:39.250 --> 15:40.830
Water come.

15:40.830 --> 15:42.620
Her water broke?

15:42.620 --> 15:44.960
One way or another, this baby
is coming in the next 24 hours.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.080
Careful.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.880
[Xander] So, they're setting up
to burn the guy?

16:09.210 --> 16:10.790
Viking-style?

16:10.790 --> 16:12.710
Seems very creepy.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.620
Yeah, but...

16:15.620 --> 16:16.960
well, it's kind of
impressive too.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.460
[sighs]

16:20.460 --> 16:22.170
Okay, I got to get to training.

16:22.170 --> 16:25.330
They got me doing a ride-along
with the water patrol.

16:25.330 --> 16:26.790
Xander...

16:26.790 --> 16:28.750
You be careful out there.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.330
The new one, Tia,

16:31.330 --> 16:33.750
she's out for blood.

16:35.750 --> 16:36.960
I thought they ran her off.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.170
They did.

16:38.170 --> 16:40.170
But she's out there,

16:40.170 --> 16:41.920
somewhere.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.170
Be careful.

16:47.250 --> 16:49.250
-[Meredith groaning]
-Hey, I got the ice.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.670
We don't need it.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.710
-Why? What happened?
-Her water broke.

16:52.710 --> 16:54.500
The baby's coming
faster than expected.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.670
-Can her body handle this?
-She's in active labor,

16:56.670 --> 16:58.120
but she's not ready.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.580
Her body hasn't
had time to adapt.

16:59.580 --> 17:00.920
A natural birth
isn't possible.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.080
Okay, so, C-section.

17:03.080 --> 17:05.620
-Yes, that's our only option.
-But she can't go to a hospital.

17:05.620 --> 17:08.880
I have what I need at the ranch.
Her blood pressure's dropping,
and we need to move fast.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.120
What if Bryan's followers
come looking for her there?

17:11.120 --> 17:14.540
Ryn and Cami aren't gonna let
anyone near her or that baby.

17:14.540 --> 17:16.290
[breathing heavily]

17:34.670 --> 17:36.540
The colors.

17:36.540 --> 17:39.290
[Beth] It's a unique
hybrid phenomenon.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.290
The chemical makeup
of our blood is different.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.670
It's beautiful.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.420
Do you believe
in the afterlife?

17:51.750 --> 17:53.620
I do.

17:53.620 --> 17:56.790
One hundred percent.

17:58.880 --> 18:02.620
I hope Bryan finds more peace
there than he did here.

18:02.620 --> 18:03.830
Yes.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.960
Let's hope that he and everyone
that leaves this life in turmoil

18:09.960 --> 18:11.920
finds peace.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.670
[cell phone vibrates]

18:18.790 --> 18:20.330
What now?

18:22.750 --> 18:23.920
Hi.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.290
[Beth]
They're bringing her here?

18:28.290 --> 18:29.920
[Helen]
They have no choice.

18:29.920 --> 18:33.210
I worry about Bryan's
people finding out.

18:33.210 --> 18:34.960
It's already dark.

18:34.960 --> 18:36.880
Most everyone from the funeral
will be gone within the hour.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.420
I'll make sure
the facilities are cleared

18:38.420 --> 18:39.710
by the time they get here.

18:39.710 --> 18:40.920
No one will talk?

18:40.920 --> 18:42.540
No one will know.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.290
So, what, you just don't
give a shit?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.380
Come on, I was, like,
ten minutes late.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.210
It's more like 20.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.710
It was 15.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.380
[dispatcher, on radio]
We got a disabled vessel
with a medical emergency,

19:35.380 --> 19:36.960
requesting assistance.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.670
Two miles south,
southeast of Point Elma.

19:40.670 --> 19:43.170
Caller is male. We're still
trying to confirm injuries.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.420
Any word on how
the boat was disabled?

19:45.420 --> 19:47.330
Requesting any further
description

19:47.330 --> 19:48.960
of the disabled vessel.

19:48.960 --> 19:50.540
Passenger tour boat, 50 footer.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.170
It's got a sign
on the deckhouse,

19:52.170 --> 19:55.210
something about
mermaid adventures.

19:55.210 --> 19:57.250
[Dennis]
1-9-5, en route.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.420
[Leena] We'll get through this.
Just stay focused.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.290
And be ready with the
instruments when I need them.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.500
yeah, I've assisted surgical
vets in a few procedures.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.580
Good. I've done more
than my share of C-sections

20:28.580 --> 20:31.670
over the years,
but this exact situation--

20:31.670 --> 20:33.000
I know. I know.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.790
We need to watch
for signs of infection.

20:34.790 --> 20:36.170
Fluid in the baby's lungs,

20:36.170 --> 20:38.460
which may or may not
resemble human lungs.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.830
We need to be prepared
for anything.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.170
[Meredith groaning]

20:41.170 --> 20:42.500
I'll administer the epidural,

20:42.500 --> 20:44.120
which will numb
her lower half.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.880
I want you watching Meredith.
BP, heart rate.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.000
Got it.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.380
[breathing heavily]

20:53.380 --> 20:54.620
I want to do this.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.170
I do.

20:56.170 --> 20:57.880
And you will.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.330
Try to relax.
Just breathe.

21:02.960 --> 21:07.330
What you wanted as a little one,
you earned today.

21:10.290 --> 21:13.290
You are one of us.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.000
[gasps and whimpers]

21:19.920 --> 21:21.420
Oh, something's...

21:21.420 --> 21:23.620
Oh, something's wrong.
Something's...

21:30.040 --> 21:31.670
[yells]

21:31.670 --> 21:33.250
-[Ben] Leena?
-[Maddie] What's going on?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.080
The baby has moved
into the birth canal.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.750
C-section?

21:36.750 --> 21:39.210
Not possible anymore. This baby
is delivering naturally.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.670
-What do you need from me?
-We'll start with the epidural.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.880
She's going to need it.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.330
[Meredith hyperventilating]

21:47.960 --> 21:49.380
Ah! No.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.330
[groans and yells]

21:54.330 --> 21:56.920
Yes. It's good.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.420
Scream.

21:58.420 --> 22:00.670
[cries]

22:00.670 --> 22:02.330
[music playing on radio]

22:08.500 --> 22:10.170
[man on bullhorn]
Tour vessel.

22:10.170 --> 22:11.710
This is the county sheriff.

22:11.710 --> 22:13.290
Prepare to be boarded.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.330
[Janine]
Over here! Hurry up!

22:18.330 --> 22:20.380
Over here.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.540
Dude...

22:22.540 --> 22:24.380
-My head. Is it bad?
-You'll be okay.

22:25.880 --> 22:27.210
Thank God you're here.

22:30.670 --> 22:32.290
These are friends of yours?

22:32.290 --> 22:33.620
Yes, sir.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.040
[Janine]
Is that feeling better?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.750
Are you doing okay?

22:36.750 --> 22:38.670
[Annie]
Where's the injured party?

22:38.670 --> 22:41.170
Xan, you came.

22:41.170 --> 22:42.750
Oh, my God,
I can't believe it.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.420
I split my head open
and you called Xander?

22:44.420 --> 22:46.670
-911, people.
-No, he's a cop now.

22:46.670 --> 22:49.000
[Libby]
Xander's a cop? No way.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.580
I thought you were a stripper.

22:50.580 --> 22:52.500
-[all laugh]
-Yeah, well, we're cops.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.670
In training.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.920
-I hate cops.
-Libby, honey, stop talking.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.500
Sorry, she hit her head.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.420
Let's take a look
at that injury.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.120
-[woman] This is embarrassing.
-Is it bad? I feel it's bad.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.540
[Dennis]
It's not as bad as you think.

23:05.540 --> 23:06.960
This is my bachelorette party.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.210
Unbelievable, right?

23:08.210 --> 23:09.670
What the hell happened?

23:09.670 --> 23:13.580
I'll admit, we are all
a little over-served.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.420
She got carried away playing,
"I'm the queen of the world,"

23:18.420 --> 23:20.290
tried to climb out
onto the bow,

23:20.290 --> 23:21.830
and then smacked her head open.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.620
It's pretty gnarly.

23:23.620 --> 23:28.080
Okay, and how did the boat
get disabled, like, exactly?

23:28.080 --> 23:30.120
The engine stalled out.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.420
We ran out of gas,

23:33.420 --> 23:35.080
because he never bothered
to fix the gauge

23:35.080 --> 23:37.500
after I bought the boat
off Eddie Coburt.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.250
It's on my list.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.330
[Dennis] Okay, we need
to get you all back to shore.

23:41.330 --> 23:43.500
Annie, radio dispatch,
tell them to have EMTs
at the docks.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.670
[Annie]
Yes, sir.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.920
[woman]
Libby strikes again.

23:49.250 --> 23:50.580
Cool friends.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.380
Hell of a day, huh?

23:58.380 --> 24:01.880
Starts with a funeral
and ends with a birth.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.330
[laughs]

24:03.330 --> 24:07.000
A pure-blood born
right here at the ranch.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.170
It's incredible.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.460
You know, I was very close
to one of them.

24:13.460 --> 24:14.830
A pure-blood?

24:14.830 --> 24:17.670
We called him Sarge.

24:17.670 --> 24:20.170
He passed away
sort of suddenly.

24:20.170 --> 24:22.330
-Oh.
-Broke my heart

24:22.330 --> 24:24.830
to think I would
never see him again.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.670
But then, I did.

24:27.670 --> 24:28.920
You did what?

24:30.420 --> 24:32.120
I saw him.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.540
He came back to me.

24:34.540 --> 24:38.580
Our community's always
believed in the spirit world.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.710
I mean, lots of stories
like yours in our history.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.710
Ghost stories?

24:44.830 --> 24:46.580
Oh, no.

24:46.580 --> 24:50.710
Less ghost stories,
and more visions.

24:50.710 --> 24:53.830
People we love
who come back to us,

24:53.830 --> 24:57.040
to comfort us,
to guide us.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.620
Or maybe to warn us.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.620
Helen, what?

25:07.790 --> 25:09.670
I was hoping to get
a better understanding

25:09.670 --> 25:11.500
of Sarge's visitations,

25:11.500 --> 25:13.330
so I took something.

25:13.330 --> 25:15.210
A sort of oceanic herb.

25:15.210 --> 25:18.460
And you had a hallucination?

25:18.460 --> 25:20.290
Oh, but it was so real.

25:21.460 --> 25:25.040
And did you see
your friend Sarge?

25:25.040 --> 25:28.580
[Helen]
No. I saw Ryn's sister, Donna.

25:28.580 --> 25:31.420
She was trying
to tell me something, but...

25:33.920 --> 25:35.040
She...

25:37.040 --> 25:38.170
decayed.

25:42.170 --> 25:44.620
Donna's soul
was crying out to you.

25:49.790 --> 25:51.000
Breathe.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.210
Blood pressure?

25:52.210 --> 25:53.540
86 over 49.

25:53.540 --> 25:54.670
-Falling.
-[Ryn] Breathe, deep.
