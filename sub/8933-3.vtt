00:01.501 --> 00:02.068
This is the Evergreen

00:02.068 --> 00:03.203
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.203 --> 00:03.370
l, serene.

00:07.574 --> 00:10.143
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.143 --> 00:11.811
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.646 --> 00:15.181
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.317
Yikes!

00:17.917 --> 00:19.252
Yaaaah...

00:22.255 --> 00:23.523
Yeaaaah!

00:23.523 --> 00:26.459
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.136
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.804 --> 00:39.039
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.709 --> 00:45.011
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:45.812 --> 00:47.047
the Raccoons!!

00:47.047 --> 00:47.447
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.996 --> 01:05.565
No, no, not
computer chips, Knox.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.367
Potato chips!

01:07.367 --> 01:09.102
It's a guaranteed market.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.037
Everybody likes
potato chips!

01:11.037 --> 01:14.174
Oh, that's
all very well, Sir.

01:14.174 --> 01:17.544
But the bottom line is sales.

01:17.544 --> 01:22.215
How well are these chips
selling, Sneer?

01:22.215 --> 01:24.918
They're selling
like hot potatoes.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.053
Mr Knox: In that case,
I am interested

01:27.053 --> 01:29.222
in buying your factory.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.691
I'll drop by on Tuesday at noon

01:31.691 --> 01:33.560
to close the deal.

01:33.560 --> 01:38.665
Of course, I want to see
those sales figures.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.366
Great! See you then!

01:40.733 --> 01:43.236
The Pig 1: But, boss,
sales figures for

01:43.236 --> 01:45.672
Sneer's snacks are way down.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.207
The Pig 2: Knox won't
buy the company,

01:47.207 --> 01:49.242
if he sees those figures.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.212
He won't, because
you're going to get them up.

01:52.212 --> 01:56.049
My chips have no nutrient value.
Lots of additives.

01:56.049 --> 01:59.419
And I've started a whole new
line of my favourite flavours.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.020
They should be best sellers.

02:01.020 --> 02:03.623
The Pig 1: Uh, some of the
flavours aren't all that...

02:03.623 --> 02:05.959
popular, boss.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.261
Nonsense!
This one for instance.

02:08.261 --> 02:11.264
Try it. Turnip with
sardine flavour.

02:11.264 --> 02:12.632
Ha. It's great!

02:12.632 --> 02:13.933
The Pigs: Ugh!

02:15.768 --> 02:17.070
Ack!
See, what I mean!

02:17.070 --> 02:18.571
Great stuff!!

02:18.571 --> 02:20.607
But I'm still losing a fortune.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.575
I've got to unload this company.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.677
Get those sales figures up!

02:24.677 --> 02:26.246
Up! Up!

02:26.246 --> 02:29.949
The Pig 1: How about a contest?
With a grand prize giveaway?

02:29.949 --> 02:33.286
Giveaway?!
Never use that word around me!

02:33.286 --> 02:34.787
The Pig 3:
Uh, sorry, boss.

02:34.787 --> 02:37.423
But we have to have
some sort of prize.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.460
The Pig: Um.. how about a bike?

02:40.460 --> 02:42.162
Every kid loves a bike.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.097
Sales are sure to go up.

02:44.097 --> 02:47.000
Hmm, a contest?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.969
Yes! A contest!

02:49.969 --> 02:52.872
And to make sure chip
sales keep going up,

02:52.872 --> 02:54.807
we'll make it a contest

02:54.807 --> 02:57.143
no one can win. Get it?

02:57.143 --> 03:00.046
Sneer/The Pigs:

03:02.782 --> 03:05.952
Ah! Nothing like
an ice cold bottle

03:05.952 --> 03:07.487
of peanut butter soda

03:07.487 --> 03:09.656
after a hot bike ride,
huh Ralph?

03:11.357 --> 03:13.426
Hi, Mr. Willow.

03:13.426 --> 03:14.894
Ya, Hi, Mr. Willow!

03:14.894 --> 03:16.362
Mr. Willow: Howdy, boys.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.797
One bottle
of lemonade

03:17.797 --> 03:19.832
and a peanut
butter soda, please.

03:19.832 --> 03:23.469
Wow! A blue phantom!

03:25.438 --> 03:27.006
Chewy chips, huh?

03:27.006 --> 03:29.008
The silent snack.

03:29.008 --> 03:31.277
Grand prize giveaway?

03:31.277 --> 03:32.679
That's for me!!

03:34.714 --> 03:37.317
Put the
puzzle pieces together,

03:37.317 --> 03:40.019
complete the picture
of the blue phantom,

03:40.019 --> 03:43.323
and win, wiiin, wiiiin!

03:43.323 --> 03:46.826
Woooow! A blue phantom.

03:46.826 --> 03:50.163
Ehm, I think I'll have
chips instead, Ralph.

03:50.163 --> 03:53.900
Bert, how can you eat
chips when you're thirsty?

03:53.900 --> 03:55.535
I want to win the prize!

03:55.535 --> 03:58.004
Uh, here ya go,
Mr. Willow.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.005
Mr. Willow:
Thanks, Bert.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.715
One piece down,
nine to go.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.817
Uh, better
get another bag.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.355
Bert, why
are you buying these?

04:15.355 --> 04:17.890
You only get five
chips in every bag.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.093
And if Cyril is
running this contest,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.328
just what do you figure
your chances are

04:22.328 --> 04:23.830
of actually winning?

04:23.830 --> 04:26.165
The same chances as
everybody else, Ralph.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.534
If you don't play,
you can't win!

04:28.534 --> 04:29.636
Here.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.707
Blech!
What is this flavour?

04:34.707 --> 04:37.043
Uh, fried egg
and broccoli.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.612
Blech! They
don't even crunch, Bert.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.848
Yeah, you're right,
but what do you want?

04:41.848 --> 04:43.683
Good taste or a prize?!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.257
I'll take another
bag, Mr. Willow.

04:51.257 --> 04:54.761
Oh, come on, Bert.
You've had two bags.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.462
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, Ralph.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.032
See ya, Mr. Willow!
Mr. Willow: Come again!

05:06.205 --> 05:08.141
Pig 1: We've got one
of these displays

05:08.141 --> 05:10.310
in every store, everywhere!

05:10.310 --> 05:12.645
Pig 2: We've got radio
and tv spots,

05:12.645 --> 05:14.947
every hour on the hour.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.584
Pig 3: Sales are
definitely up. See?

05:18.584 --> 05:19.986
That's not good enough!

05:19.986 --> 05:21.421
I want billboards!

05:21.421 --> 05:23.423
I want ads on
the sides of buses!

05:23.423 --> 05:25.992
I want junk mail
on every doorstep!

05:25.992 --> 05:29.128
Get those sale figures
up by Tuesday!

05:29.128 --> 05:32.565
I want to unload
those chips... on Knox!

05:32.565 --> 05:34.267
Yes, Sir!

05:37.470 --> 05:40.473
I want both of you
to know that this

05:40.473 --> 05:43.009
is my favourite thing...

05:43.009 --> 05:45.845
Ironing.. on a
sunny afternoon.

05:45.845 --> 05:49.582
Yes, I don't want to go
fishing or bike riding.

05:49.582 --> 05:52.085
Oh no, just let me iron.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.953
It's gotta
be done, Bert.

05:55.788 --> 05:56.789
Melissa/Ralph: Huh?!

06:00.259 --> 06:03.363
Huh?
Eat Sneer's chewy chips

06:03.363 --> 06:05.832
and win the blue phantom?

06:05.832 --> 06:07.967
The blue phantom! Oh!

06:07.967 --> 06:09.502
Bert...

06:09.502 --> 06:11.537
Bert!! Your shirt!

06:11.537 --> 06:12.772
Wh-what?!

06:12.772 --> 06:14.240
Bert!

06:14.240 --> 06:16.242
Well, I guess that's it.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.611
I've had it for today.

06:18.611 --> 06:21.647
I gotta get some... fresh air.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.816
Yeah! I'm going for a ride.

06:23.816 --> 06:26.052
Well, it is a nice day.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.754
Ralph and I will come with you.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.356
No..no.
You don't have to.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.299
Uh, suddenly,
I feel kinda hungry.

06:40.299 --> 06:42.368
I think I need a snack.

06:42.368 --> 06:44.170
Well, we could head back

06:44.170 --> 06:46.005
and I'll make you a great salad!

06:46.005 --> 06:47.840
Uh-oh-uh, no!

06:47.840 --> 06:49.776
I was thinking of something

06:49.776 --> 06:51.978
a bit more... exotic.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.715
Uh-oh-uh, how about
a bag of chips?

06:55.715 --> 06:58.217
You call
chips exotic, Bert?

06:58.217 --> 07:01.053
Yeah, if it's sour
cream and liver flavour.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.389
Say Ralph, you got fifty cents?

07:04.557 --> 07:06.159
Thanks. See you at the store.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.060
Blech! Ugh...

07:08.060 --> 07:10.563
He must really want
to win that prize.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.998
I hope it's worth it.

07:11.998 --> 07:13.499
It couldn't be.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.436
Sour cream and liver. Yuck!

07:22.241 --> 07:24.744
Pig 1: Sales are way up, boss.

07:24.744 --> 07:29.348
Yeah? And how much is all
this advertising costing me?

07:29.348 --> 07:32.385
Pig 2: Well, you can't
look at it that way, boss.

07:32.385 --> 07:34.754
I always
look at it that way!

07:34.754 --> 07:37.990
Pig 1: But boss,
the contest is working.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.093
The sales figures
will be sky high

07:41.093 --> 07:42.895
by the time Knox sees them.

07:42.895 --> 07:46.299
As long as
nobody wins the prize!

07:46.299 --> 07:48.401
Pig 3: They won't win.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.937
They'll just keep
buying and buying,

07:50.937 --> 07:53.639
hoping to find the last
piece of the picture

07:53.639 --> 07:55.508
of the blue phantom.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.977
Pig 1: And there's
only one piece

07:57.977 --> 07:59.946
that can complete the puzzle.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.281
Pig 2: And we've got it

08:02.281 --> 08:04.884
right here, boss.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.486
Brilliant!

08:06.486 --> 08:10.923
You, pigs, are finally
learning something from me!

08:10.923 --> 08:12.925
Lock that piece in the vault!

08:18.598 --> 08:20.566
I just need one more piece

08:20.566 --> 08:22.635
but it's not here, Broo.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.337
It's not fair!

08:27.273 --> 08:31.010
Yuck! Ralph's right.
They don't crunch.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.111
Ech!

08:34.013 --> 08:35.414
Good night, Broo.

09:01.007 --> 09:04.143
Where's my prize?

09:04.143 --> 09:06.045
What happened?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.781
You didn't buy enough!

09:09.382 --> 09:11.984
There's one piece missing.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.921
You didn't buy enough!

09:14.921 --> 09:17.490
There's one piece missing.

09:17.490 --> 09:21.994
Buy! Buy! Buy!

09:23.930 --> 09:25.197
Oh-oh!

09:27.166 --> 09:29.068
That.. that was horrible!

09:29.068 --> 09:31.304
Ooh! I gotta win.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.072
I gotta buy more!

09:34.240 --> 09:36.175
Aha. Money!!

09:38.744 --> 09:42.915
Oh no! Only 35 cents!

09:42.915 --> 09:46.218
But I know I'm gonna win.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.487
I know that winning
piece is gonna be

09:48.487 --> 09:50.923
in the very next bag I buy!

09:50.923 --> 09:54.460
I just gotta get
some money somehow!

10:01.734 --> 10:03.469
I'm
worried about Bert.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.871
He's obsessed
with potato chips,

10:05.871 --> 10:07.139
and winning that bike.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.742
It can't be
as bad as all that, Melissa.

10:15.381 --> 10:19.952
♪ (slow sad music) ♪

10:39.305 --> 10:41.240
Bert, are you ok?

10:41.240 --> 10:45.344
Umm,..sure. Why?

10:45.344 --> 10:47.380
Would you
like some toast, Bert?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.849
Neah. I'm not hungry.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.585
Bert, we were thinking
of going on a picnic today.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.819
Do you want to come?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.155
Nah.
Thanks, Melissa,

10:56.155 --> 10:59.091
but.. I've got things to do.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.160
Important things!

11:03.963 --> 11:07.833
Look at this,
my bronzed baby booties.

11:07.833 --> 11:11.103
My Captain California skateboard.

11:11.103 --> 11:14.306
My complete collection
of baseball cards.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.343
My first guitar...

11:17.610 --> 11:19.045
Aaah!

11:19.045 --> 11:20.946
This should be
worth a few bucks.

11:20.946 --> 11:23.416
Hi, Bert.
What are you doing?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.784
Oh, hi, Cedric.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.952
A yard sale is what I'm doing.

11:28.654 --> 11:30.656
You can't
sell this, Bert.

11:30.656 --> 11:32.525
It's all your good stuff!

11:32.525 --> 11:34.293
Nah. It' s just junk.

11:34.293 --> 11:36.295
I've outgrown it all.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.764
Look at this
baseball card, Cedric.

11:38.764 --> 11:41.534
Mickey Mantelpiece.
A collector's item!

11:41.534 --> 11:43.002
Yo-you wanna buy it?

11:43.002 --> 11:45.738
Gee, Bert, I, uh,
don't really think...

11:45.738 --> 11:47.907
No? Well...

11:47.907 --> 11:50.042
how about this baseball glove?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.011
I only used it to play catch.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.448
It's a good deal.
Uh..two bucks. Okay?

11:55.448 --> 11:57.683
Okay,
if you're sure, Bert.

11:57.683 --> 11:58.851
I'm sure, I'm sure!!

11:58.851 --> 12:00.786
You drive a hard
bargain, Cedric!

12:00.786 --> 12:03.589
Listen, sell the rest of
this stuff for me, okay?

12:03.589 --> 12:05.925
I.. uh.. gotta go..uh...

12:05.925 --> 12:06.959
somewhere.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.894
But...
but where are you..?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.130
But, but..uh...

12:11.130 --> 12:12.364
See ya, Bert.

12:12.364 --> 12:14.233
Hi, Cedric!
What are you doing

12:14.233 --> 12:15.568
with all of Bert's stuff?

12:15.568 --> 12:19.638
Uh, he asked me to
sell it, then he rode off!

12:19.638 --> 12:21.707
Towards
Mr. Willow's store, Cedric?

12:21.707 --> 12:24.510
I guess.
He had two dollars.

12:24.510 --> 12:28.013
Oh no! He's
gone to buy more chips!

12:28.013 --> 12:30.549
Bert's fixation with
winning that contest

12:30.549 --> 12:31.884
is getting out of hand.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.420
Hm, what
are we going to do?

12:41.393 --> 12:44.196
Pig 1: You were supposed
to put that in the vault!

12:44.196 --> 12:46.065
Pig 3: Yeah, I know, but I,

12:46.065 --> 12:49.001
um, forgot the combination.

12:49.001 --> 12:51.804
Was it 4-12-4
or the other way around?

12:51.804 --> 12:53.939
Pig 2: Well,
never mind that now.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.574
We don't have time!

12:55.574 --> 12:57.510
Just put it someplace safe.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.545
Pig 1: And don't
let the boss know.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.022
Nah, I didn't...

14:50.022 --> 14:52.625
Hey, who told you?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.894
Melissa and Ralph
are a bit worried about

14:54.894 --> 14:57.563
the way you're letting
this contest get to you.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.565
It isn't
getting to me, Cedric!

14:59.565 --> 15:02.234
And I wish they'd
mind their own business!

15:02.234 --> 15:04.737
Hey, you sold all my stuff!

15:04.737 --> 15:06.005
Good!

15:06.005 --> 15:08.073
How much did you make, Cedric?

15:08.707 --> 15:10.743
Five bucks!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.678
Quit kidding around, Cedric.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.146
Where's the rest of the money?

15:14.146 --> 15:16.882
That's it, Bert.
Five bucks?

15:16.882 --> 15:18.918
You sold all my good stuff

15:18.918 --> 15:21.587
for five measly bucks?!

15:21.587 --> 15:24.223
I trusted you, Cedric.

15:24.223 --> 15:26.325
How could you sell
my flugelhorn,

15:26.325 --> 15:29.395
my comic books, my woodchuck
berry guitar pick,

15:29.395 --> 15:30.729
my guitar...

15:30.729 --> 15:33.332
All for $5?

15:33.332 --> 15:34.333
But Bert...

15:34.333 --> 15:36.535
Thanks, Cedric.
Thanks a lot.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.237
You're some friend.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.040
Well, I guess this is my

15:41.040 --> 15:44.009
last chance at the blue phantom,

15:44.009 --> 15:45.244
aah...

15:45.244 --> 15:47.313
every guy's dream.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.748
But Bert,
your chances of finding

15:49.748 --> 15:52.618
the last piece are astronomical!

15:52.618 --> 15:55.354
That's the difference
between you and me, Cedric.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.791
Huh! I'm willing
to take a chance!

15:59.425 --> 16:02.895
My destiny awaits!

16:06.565 --> 16:08.067
Oh, hi gang.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.738
He wasn't happy, but he
took the five dollars anyway.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.406
This is serious!

16:50.476 --> 16:52.411
Pig 1: That's the last delivery.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.113
Pig 2:
It's gotta be in there!

16:54.913 --> 16:58.584
Pig 3: I hope so.
I can't go any further.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.854
Mr. Willow: Bert, surely
you're not buying more chips?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.723
Yeah I am Mr. Willow,
and please,

17:04.723 --> 17:06.959
don't you lecture me too.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.660
I know what I'm doing!

17:18.437 --> 17:22.474
My last chance.
And no money left!

17:22.474 --> 17:24.343
Ralph! Melissa!

17:24.343 --> 17:26.278
I-I'm so glad
you're here.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.647
Hey, ya got 50 cents?

17:28.647 --> 17:30.716
Bert, you're
letting this contest

17:30.716 --> 17:32.217
take over your life!

17:32.217 --> 17:34.420
Look, what's
happening to you.

17:34.420 --> 17:37.523
Ralphie,
there's one bag left!

17:37.523 --> 17:41.060
If the winning piece
isn't there, I'll stop.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.461
I promise ya.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.830
50 cents, Ralph,
Melissa. Please?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.132
You-you'll think differently,
when I'm the winner

17:47.132 --> 17:49.168
of the blue phantom,

17:49.168 --> 17:52.704
the most fabulous
prize there is.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.206
Please!!

17:54.206 --> 17:58.277
A quarter each. Please? Please?!

17:58.277 --> 17:59.845
Okay, Bert. But that bag

17:59.845 --> 18:01.713
is the last one, you promise?

18:01.713 --> 18:02.714
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

18:02.714 --> 18:05.551
Pig 2: Hold it!
Pig 3: That's our bag!

18:05.551 --> 18:07.152

18:07.152 --> 18:09.154
Oh no, you don't!

Bert/Pigs:

18:21.033 --> 18:23.469
Mr. Willow: Stop it right now,
before somebody gets hurt!

18:23.469 --> 18:24.736
Uuh!

19:16.755 --> 19:18.290
I..won.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.762
I expected,
Bert back before now.

19:23.762 --> 19:24.963
He's probably out riding

19:24.963 --> 19:27.166
on his new blue
phantom, Melissa.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.501
I imagine, he won't
be back for awhile.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.307
Hi, guys.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.577
Um, listen, there's
something i'd like to say.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.779
I sold everything I had,

19:40.779 --> 19:43.482
wasted my time and money.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.083
But what's worse...

19:45.083 --> 19:46.785
I insulted my friends

19:46.785 --> 19:49.021
and I ignored their good advice.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.191
Winning that way,
just isn't worth the price.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.627
But.. anyway,
I got a little something

19:55.627 --> 19:58.130
for you, Ralph and Melissa.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.669
Oh, Bert!
It's beautiful!

20:03.669 --> 20:05.604
But how could you afford it?

20:05.604 --> 20:08.106
Ahh, I sold
the Blue Phantom.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.643
I paid Mr. Willow for
the damage to his store too,

20:11.643 --> 20:15.180
and well, I got you this.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.115
Oh, thanks, Bert.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.885
And we've got a little
something for you too!

20:19.885 --> 20:22.654
Hey, my stuff!

20:22.654 --> 20:24.823
It's all here.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.658
M-my snowshoes,

20:26.658 --> 20:28.227
my pogo stick.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.729
Oh, my wind-up teeth.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.298
My guitar!

20:33.298 --> 20:35.500
Especially my guitar!

20:35.500 --> 20:36.902
We couldn't
let you throw away

20:36.902 --> 20:38.704
all the things you love, Bert.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.505
Gee thanks, guys.

20:40.505 --> 20:43.709
But, if I'd never gotten
any of this stuff back,

20:43.709 --> 20:45.677
I'd still have you.

20:45.677 --> 20:46.979
Oh, hey, guess what?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.880
I still got 50 cents left.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.749
Enough to buy a bag of chips.

20:50.749 --> 20:53.418
Bert!!
Just kidding!

20:53.418 --> 20:55.554
Just kidding, guys.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.826
Alright.
Give me the bad news!

21:00.826 --> 21:03.528
How much did the
ad campaign cost me?

21:03.528 --> 21:04.730
I can take it.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.031
Okay, Pop.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.968
Four hundred and
seventy three thousand,

21:09.968 --> 21:12.571
two hundred and
ninety two dollars

21:12.571 --> 21:14.773
and thirty three cents.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.241
I can't take it!

21:16.241 --> 21:18.076
Knox backs out of the sale,

21:18.076 --> 21:20.912
and I'm stuck with a warehouse
full of potato chips!

21:20.912 --> 21:22.881
Those pigs had better
come up with a way

21:22.881 --> 21:24.349
to get rid of those chips,

21:24.349 --> 21:26.084
or I'll turn them into chops!

21:26.084 --> 21:29.021
About time! What's for dinner?
