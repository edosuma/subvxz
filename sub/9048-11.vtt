OR LEGALLY.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.404
- YES, I KNOW,

07:51.470 --> 07:53.773
BUT I ALSO KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG.

07:56.442 --> 08:00.213
- OH, IT'S WAY TOO COLD
AND WINDY TO GO OUT THERE.

08:00.279 --> 08:01.581
LET'S GO FIND JENNA AND LUKE.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.416
- NO, JENNA SAID SHE WANTS TO BE
ON HER OWN TODAY.

08:03.482 --> 08:06.085
WE DON'T WANT TO BE
BUZZKILL HELICOPTER PARENTS.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.888
- MY SHINING IS REALLY STRONG
IN THIS ALTITUDE,

08:08.955 --> 08:11.557
AND I AM SENSING JENNA
DOES NOT WANT HER BUZZ KILLED.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.862
AND THAT THERE IS A WILD ANIMAL
CRAVING SOME ME.

08:18.598 --> 08:22.201
HEY, BIGGIE, FORAGING
FOR SOME BERRIES AND NUTS?

08:22.268 --> 08:23.936
- AND HONEY, HONEY.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.438
I'M OFF AT 4:00.

08:25.504 --> 08:27.773
APRES SKI IN THE BASE LODGE BAR?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.542
- APRES, YES.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.044
[growls]

08:33.111 --> 08:34.179
- OH, MY GOD!

08:34.246 --> 08:35.648
OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

08:35.715 --> 08:37.149
THIS IS SCARE-IFYING!

08:37.216 --> 08:39.251
BUT I THINK I FINALLY GOT IT.
- OKAY.

08:39.318 --> 08:41.153
NOW THAT YOU'RE STRAPPED IN,
YOU CAN TRY MOVING.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.421
LET'S START WITH FALLING LEAF.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.789
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO FALL.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.124
- THEN LET'S JUST HOLD A BEAT,

08:45.191 --> 08:47.460
AND YOU CAN TRY
NOT MOVING ON THE BOARD.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.595
- SORRY I'M SUCH A SPAZTRON.

08:49.662 --> 08:52.632
YOU CAN GO DO THE BLACK DIAMOND
WITH MATTY IF YOU WANT.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.100
- YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
THAT MUCH OF A SPAZ.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.368
- YEAH, I HAVE.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.103
AND I DON'T JUST MEAN TODAY.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.838
I MEAN, LIKE,
FOR MONTHS NOW,

08:58.905 --> 09:01.941
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
PUTTING UP WITH IT.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.911
- WELL, BACK AT YOU.

09:04.977 --> 09:08.080
THOSE WEREN'T EXACTLY
MY FINEST HOURS EITHER.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.383
I'M GLAD WE'RE STILL FRIENDS.
- SO GLAD.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.051
WE ONLY HAVE
ONE MORE SEMESTER TOGETHER,

09:12.118 --> 09:14.020
AND I KEEP HAVING THESE
FLASH-FORWARDS

09:14.086 --> 09:16.455
TO THE FLASHBACKS I'LL HAVE OF
HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I'M IN COLLEGE,

09:16.522 --> 09:20.426
AND I WANT THEM TO BE
MAGICAL MOMENTS WITH MY PPFFs.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.328
"PERMA-POSSE
OF FRIENDS FOREVER."

09:24.063 --> 09:25.331
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.632
- ARE YOU READY?
- YEAH.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.401
- YOU SURE?
- NO.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.703
[beeping sound]

09:30.770 --> 09:32.171
- I THINK I SEE THE HOUSE.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.205
- YOU BE CAREFUL, SADITA.

09:33.272 --> 09:34.907
I NEED YOUR HELP ON THE TRUCK.

09:34.974 --> 09:37.209
YOU KNOW, THE WIENERS LIKE IT
WHEN YOU HOLD THEM.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.577
- YEAH, THAT'S CLEVER.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.813
THANK YOU, AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW IT GOES.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.248
- LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SAFE,
OKAY?

09:42.315 --> 09:43.649
YOU THINK
YOU'RE THIS TOUGH BITCH,

09:43.716 --> 09:45.518
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE
A FRAGILE LITTLE PRINCESS.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.919
- GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.389
- THIS IS
A REALLY NICE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.557
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

09:51.624 --> 09:52.758
- WELL,
SHE'S A PSYCHOTIC GRIFTER.

09:52.825 --> 09:53.759
USE YOUR IMAGINATION.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.361
- I'M JUST SCARED.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.362
- DON'T WORRY.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.363
IF SHE PULLS A GUN,

09:57.430 --> 09:58.731
I'LL USE YOU AS MY HUMAN SHIELD,

09:58.798 --> 10:00.399
AND YOU'LL DIE A QUICK
AND PAINLESS DEATH.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.068
- ARE YOU EVER NOT
A TOTAL BITCH?

10:02.134 --> 10:03.903
- ONLY TO PEOPLE
WHO DON'T REPULSE ME.

10:03.970 --> 10:04.904
- GOOD.
GO BY YOURSELF.

10:04.971 --> 10:05.905
- WAIT!
DON'T GO.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.043
- WHY?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.678
- BECAUSE.

10:16.649 --> 10:20.186
I WOULD FEEL BETTER...
IF YOU WERE HERE.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.223
- WELL, SADIE, IF THAT'S YOU
BEGGING ME TO COME WITH YOU,

10:24.290 --> 10:25.624
THEN I GUESS I HAVE TO
COME WITH YOU.

10:25.691 --> 10:26.759
- THAT IS NOT BEGGING.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.227
ANYWAY, I HAVE MACE
IN MY POCKET

10:28.294 --> 10:30.296
IN CASE THE NUT JOB
TRIES ANYTHING.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.299
[doorbell rings]

10:35.434 --> 10:36.535
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

10:36.602 --> 10:38.104
- BLOWING THAT BITCH'S COVER.

10:38.170 --> 10:40.206
EVA'S REAL NAME ISN'T EVEN EVA.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.208
IT'S AMBER HORN
FROM SAN PEDRO.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.143
SHE STABBED A GUY IN THE FACE
WITH A PENCIL.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.812
- EXCUSE ME, HAMILCRAP,
THAT IS MY INTEL.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.882
- WHOA, WHOA, YOU GUYS,
JUST STOP IT.

10:49.949 --> 10:52.018
I KNOW YOU HAVE A THING
AGAINST EVA,

10:52.084 --> 10:53.252
BUT YOU NEED TO DEAL.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.653
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO SHE REALLY IS?

10:54.720 --> 10:55.988
- YEAH, I DO;
SHE TOLD ME.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.624
BUT SHE IS MY GIRLFRIEND,
AND--

10:58.691 --> 10:59.892
- AND WHAT?

10:59.959 --> 11:01.327
- AND IT IS REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.532
- I'M PREGNANT.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.173
- OBVIOUSLY MATTY AND I

11:14.240 --> 11:15.174
STILL HAVE A LOT
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT,

11:15.241 --> 11:16.375
SO DO YOU MIND LEAVING US ALONE?

11:16.442 --> 11:18.310
- I DO MIND, AMBER.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.814
I CALL BULL[bleep]
ON THIS PREGNANCY.

11:21.881 --> 11:22.915
PREGNANT WITH WHAT?

11:22.982 --> 11:24.150
YOU'VE LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING

11:24.216 --> 11:26.285
SINCE THE DAY YOU GOT TO PHHS.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.820
- MATTY, I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

11:27.887 --> 11:29.688
- LISTEN, YOU GUYS,
YOU NEED TO GO.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.160
- YEAH, YOU TRY
GETTING US A CAB.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.664
- SO THERE'S A LOT MORE, MATTY,
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW,

11:38.731 --> 11:40.566
AND I'M SURE THEY'RE DYING
TO TELL YOU,

11:40.633 --> 11:42.468
SO I'D RATHER YOU HEAR IT
FROM ME FIRST.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.969
- THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.237
- I DON'T LIVE IN P.V.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.006
I LIVE IN SAN PEDRO
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER

11:47.073 --> 11:50.376
BECAUSE MY PARENTS ABANDONED ME
WHEN I WAS SEVEN.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.477
- I'M SORRY.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.878
- MATTY, YOU KNOW
YOU HAVE TO TAKE

11:52.945 --> 11:54.213
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS
WITH A MAJOR GRAIN OF SALT.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.115
- I JUST REALLY WANTED TO GO
TO A GOOD SCHOOL

11:56.182 --> 11:58.017
AND BELONG SOMEWHERE
WITH PEOPLE LIKE YOU GUYS.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.019
YOU SEEM LIKE
SUCH A TIGHT-KNIT GROUP.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.455
- ACTUALLY, JENNA AND I
HATE EACH OTHER.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.757
- I JUST WANTED A CHANCE
AT A BETTER LIFE.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.860
- MATTY, CAN I SHOW YOU PICTURES
OF AMBER'S BEDROOM?

12:07.927 --> 12:09.195
- [sighs]

12:09.261 --> 12:11.464
YOU MUST BE
SO PROUD OF YOURSELF, SADIE.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.332
IT WASN'T ENOUGH
YOU ATTACKED ME ON THE BUS.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.700
YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF MY GRANDMOTHER,

12:14.767 --> 12:16.268
AN OLD WOMAN WHO'S, LIKE,

12:16.335 --> 12:17.369
THE ONLY PERSON
IN MY FAMILY

12:17.436 --> 12:18.571
THAT GIVES A CRAP
ABOUT ME?

12:18.637 --> 12:20.339
SO YOU SNOOP THROUGH MY BEDROOM?

12:20.406 --> 12:21.407
GOOD JOB.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.975
- YOU'RE NUTS.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.243
- [scoffs]

12:24.310 --> 12:25.544
I'VE BEEN ATTACKED
BY GIRLS LIKE YOU

12:25.611 --> 12:26.812
MY WHOLE LIFE,

12:26.879 --> 12:28.447
AND THE KID I "ATTACKED"
IN THE FOURTH GRADE,

12:28.514 --> 12:30.149
SHE WAS WITH TWO OTHER KIDS
IN THE BATHROOM,

12:30.216 --> 12:32.852
HOLDING ME DOWN, TRYING TO DUNK
MY HEAD INTO A TOILET,

12:32.918 --> 12:34.253
TALKING ABOUT HOW TRASH I WAS.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.690
SO, YEAH, LUCKY FOR ME,
THERE WAS A PENCIL ON THE FLOOR.

12:37.756 --> 12:38.824
- [scoffs]

12:38.891 --> 12:39.825
- AND THERE'S MORE, MATTY,

12:39.892 --> 12:41.627
AND IF YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE,

12:41.694 --> 12:43.562
I'LL EXPLAIN TO YOU ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.631
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I NEVER LIED ABOUT

12:45.698 --> 12:46.832
THAT I WOULD NEVER,

12:46.899 --> 12:48.601
AND THOSE ARE
MY FEELINGS FOR YOU.

12:48.667 --> 12:49.869
THEY'RE SACRED.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.737
- THE SOCIOPATHIC SLAG IS GOOD.

12:51.804 --> 12:53.405
GOT TO HAND HER THAT.

12:56.242 --> 12:57.176
- HOO!

12:57.243 --> 12:59.245
CRAZY POWDER DAY, HUH?

12:59.311 --> 13:00.813
- HI.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.781
SORRY, DO I KNOW YOU?

13:02.848 --> 13:05.618
- YEAH, VAL, IT'S WILL.

13:05.684 --> 13:06.685
BIGGIE.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.287
- OH.

13:08.354 --> 13:09.321
OH.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.690
SORRY, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU

13:11.757 --> 13:13.225
WITHOUT YOUR--
YOU KNOW, YOUR HEAD ON.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.226
- [laughs]

13:14.293 --> 13:15.294
YEAH, HERE I AM.

13:15.361 --> 13:16.962
- YEAH.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.231
IT'S A WHOLE NEW BIGGIE, HUH?

13:19.298 --> 13:22.268
JUST NO FUR.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.873
- OH, GOD, THERE HE IS.

13:40.686 --> 13:41.620
{\an8}ARE YOU CRAZY?

13:41.687 --> 13:43.122
{\an8}YOU COULD HAVE DIED OUT THERE!

13:43.189 --> 13:44.490
{\an8}THEN WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE?

13:44.557 --> 13:45.824
{\an8}- I DIDN'T ALMOST DIE.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.459
{\an8}IT'S JUST A SPRAIN.

13:47.526 --> 13:50.262
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE IT DOWN A NOTCH, GRAMPS.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.263
- YEAH, THANKS, LACE.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.332
[groans]

13:53.399 --> 13:55.501
MAYBE I AM FEELING
A LITTLE OLD.

13:55.568 --> 13:58.003
BEING AROUND ALL THESE
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS,

13:58.070 --> 14:00.439
MY LITTLE GIRL
ABOUT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.575
- HONEY, DON'T FEEL OLD.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.043
THAT MAKES ME FEEL OLD.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.413
[laughs]

14:07.479 --> 14:08.847
- WOULD YOU LIKE ANOTHER DRINK,

14:08.914 --> 14:11.283
OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO
HEAD BACK TO MY DEN?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.818
[growls]

14:12.885 --> 14:14.620
- UH, ACTUALLY, BIGGIE,

14:14.687 --> 14:17.122
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
SENSE THIS SOONER.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.491
GUESS MY SHINING
ISN'T INFALLIBLE.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.626
- YOUR SHINING?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.061
- MY EXTREME ACUITY,
MY SIXTH SENSE,

14:22.127 --> 14:23.796
IT CAN SOMETIMES BE A BURDEN.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.898
BUT, ANYWAY, YOU SEEM LIKE
A NICE GUY.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.867
I JUST--I THINK I WAS SO DAZZLED
BY THE COSTUME,

14:28.934 --> 14:31.303
THAT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE WITHOUT IT.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.605
- OH, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TAKE OFF

14:32.671 --> 14:34.640
ANY PART OF THE COSTUME
WHILE I'M ON DUTY.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.142
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE A BEAR BODY
AND A HUMAN HEAD,

14:37.209 --> 14:38.577
IT WOULD JUST
DESTROY THE ILLUSION.

14:38.644 --> 14:39.578
- OF COURSE.

14:39.645 --> 14:40.779
OF COURSE.

14:40.846 --> 14:43.249
I THINK I'M JUST
A LITTLE MORE ATTRACTED

14:43.315 --> 14:46.352
TO THE BEAR THAN THE MAN.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.554
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT ME.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.556
MAYBE I SHOULD GET A DOG.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.925
- IT'S COOL.

14:52.992 --> 14:57.730
YOUR SHINING THING
KIND OF CREEPED ME OUT ANYWAY.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.231
- WELL...

15:00.599 --> 15:02.601
THANKS FOR THE WALK
ON THE WILD SIDE, THOUGH.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.708
- I CAN'T BELIEVE MATTY
BLEW ME OFF,

15:09.775 --> 15:10.809
AND ON A POWDER DAY.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.278
- AND WHERE'S JENNA?

15:12.344 --> 15:13.746
I'M STARTING TO GET
A LITTLE WORRIED.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.481
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:15.547 --> 15:16.949
- HAVE YOU SEEN JENNA?

15:17.016 --> 15:18.917
- WE HAVEN'T FROM HEARD FROM HER
OR MATTY ALL DAY.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.153
- LUCKILY, I HAVE MY GIFT
OF THE SHINING.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.055
IF I CAN JUST CONCENTRATE,

15:23.122 --> 15:26.558
IT WILL GUIDE THEM TO ME.

15:26.625 --> 15:27.926
OH, MY GOD,
MY SHINING IS STRONG,

15:27.993 --> 15:29.728
IT'S SUCKING THE ENERGY
OUT OF ALL THE LIGHTS.

15:29.795 --> 15:30.729
- [screams]

15:30.796 --> 15:32.197
THIS IS A SIGN FROM GOD.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.234
- LISSA, DEAREST,
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.403
- BUT I'VE THOUGHT OF
DOING SOMETHING WRONG.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.404
- YOU HAVE?

15:38.470 --> 15:39.738
- YES.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.874
ALL THE TIME.

15:41.940 --> 15:43.575
ISN'T THAT JUST AS BAD?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
HELL FEELS REALLY GOOD.

15:50.516 --> 15:53.152
- HUH, WELL,
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTING COZIER.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.988
- I'LL LOOK FOR CANDLES
AND FLASHLIGHTS.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.189
- I'LL COME WITH YOU.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.961
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT I WOULDN'T
BE HERE WITH SADIE

16:03.028 --> 16:05.664
IF I WASN'T REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU WITH HER.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.166
- WELL, I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

16:07.232 --> 16:08.367
- WOULD YOU PLEASE LISTEN TO ME?

16:08.434 --> 16:10.035
I HAVE GIVEN UP A LOT
TO BE HERE.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.537
LUKE PRETTY MUCH DUMPED ME.

16:11.603 --> 16:12.538
- SHE'S PREGNANT, JENNA.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.605
YOU HEARD THAT PART, RIGHT?

16:13.672 --> 16:14.606
- AND YOU BELIEVE HER?

16:14.673 --> 16:15.874
- AT THE MOMENT, YES.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.876
I THINK I HAVE TO
TAKE HER WORD FOR IT.

16:17.943 --> 16:20.179
- SHE JUST ADMITTED TO BEING
A COMPULSIVE LIAR.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.480
HAS SHE EVEN TAKEN A TEST?

16:21.547 --> 16:23.015
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
I WAS PREGNANT ONCE.

16:23.082 --> 16:25.851
- YEAH, AND YOU WERE SO UPFRONT
AND HONEST ABOUT IT AT THE TIME.

16:28.253 --> 16:29.254
- HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

16:29.321 --> 16:30.255
- DON'T KNOW YET.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.290
I ONLY SKIPPED ONE PERIOD.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.725
- WHY DIDN'T YOU USE PROTECTION?

16:32.791 --> 16:34.226
- I KNOW.
IT'S CRAZY.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.794
WE USE CONDOMS EVERY TIME.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.863
IT'S LIKE THE UNIVERSE
JUST WANTED US TO HAVE A BABY.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.465
- YEAH, RIGHT.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.300
THAT'S WHAT THE UNIVERSE WANTS.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.901
- GOT 'EM.

16:42.968 --> 16:46.004
LOOK, LET'S NOT GET INTO ANY
MORE OF THIS [bleep], ALL RIGHT?

16:47.706 --> 16:48.640
TRUCE?

16:49.975 --> 16:51.577
- I JUST WANT YOU TO BE OKAY.

16:51.643 --> 16:54.380
- IF SHE'S REALLY HAVING MY KID,
I GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.815
I'M NOT PUTTING MY KID UP
FOR ADOPTION.

16:56.882 --> 16:58.384
- I KNOW.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.385
- ALL RIGHT.

17:11.096 --> 17:12.431

17:12.498 --> 17:15.134
- UH...THIS ISN'T
THE SCHAFERS' PLACE?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.602
DO YOU KNOW MY FRIENDS
CAROL AND BILL?

17:16.667 --> 17:18.637
- WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE FROM THEM
FIVE YEARS AGO.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.672
- OH, GOD, I'M SO SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.008
YOU HAD A KEY OUT
RIGHT WHERE THEY KEPT THEIRS.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.010
- WOULD YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
PLEASE LEAVE

17:25.077 --> 17:26.878
BEFORE I CALL THE POLICE?

17:33.619 --> 17:35.287
- THE REST OF THAT NIGHT
WAS A BLUR.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.156
SOMEHOW, EVA TALKED THE OWNERS
OF THAT HOUSE

17:37.222 --> 17:38.624
OUT OF CALLING THE POLICE.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.826
SOMEHOW, MATTY'S FAITH IN EVA
SEEMED UNWAVERING,

17:40.893 --> 17:43.729
AND SOMEHOW, I MADE IT BACK
TO THE LODGE AND MY BED.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.197
IT WAS A VERY FAR CRY

17:45.264 --> 17:47.166

WITH LUKE I'D BEEN PLANNING.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.167

THE AIR WAS CLEAR.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.071

DOING HERE?

17:53.138 --> 17:55.040

17:55.107 --> 17:56.108

OFF THIS MOUNTAIN.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.355

18:10.422 --> 18:12.958
- WELL, WE ALL HAVE TO
GROW UP SOME TIME.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.927
- THANKS, JENNA.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.929
- IT WAS SO SCARY LAST NIGHT.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.797
I KEPT WISHING
I HAD SOMEONE TO HOLD ME,

18:18.864 --> 18:22.167
BECAUSE I WAS ALL ALONE,
BY MYSELF, ALONE.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.005
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHY EVA'S GETTING BUSTED

18:27.072 --> 18:28.874
AS A HOUSE CRASHER
DIDN'T SEND MATTY RUNNING.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.009
EITHER HE STILL
ACTUALLY BELIEVED IN HER,

18:31.076 --> 18:33.378
OR HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

18:33.445 --> 18:35.047
WHICH WAS VERY MATTY

18:35.113 --> 18:37.483
AND KIND OF HEARTBREAKING
TO WATCH.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.818
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE ANOTHER TEST TO BE SURE.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.220
THERE CAN BE FALSE POSITIVES.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.221

18:42.287 --> 18:43.222
YEAH, I KNOW.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.890
- I JUST WANT TO BE SURE.

18:44.957 --> 18:45.891
- OF COURSE.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.659
AND I WANT YOU TO BE SURE.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.499
- I REALLY COULDN'T TELL
WHAT HE WAS THINKING,

18:53.565 --> 18:54.800
WHICH WAS UNSETTLING.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.603
BUT SEEING MATTY TAKE CONTROL
OF HIS SITUATION

18:57.669 --> 18:59.505
MADE ME REALIZE
I HAD TO FIND A WAY

18:59.571 --> 19:01.039
TO TAKE CONTROL OF MINE.

19:03.008 --> 19:03.942
LUKE?

19:19.758 --> 19:20.959
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

YOU STILL HAVE
A LOT OF GROWING UP TO DO.

19:27.533 --> 19:32.538
AND I THINK, FOR NOW, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY JUST GO DO THAT.
