[bored teenager over p.A.]
<i> attention, shoppers,</i>
<i> a mother's love is forever,</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:11.260
<i> But mother's love rat poison</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:13.470
<i> Is only on sale</i>
<i> till the end of the day.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:16.598
Aw.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.060
[birds singing]

00:20.062 --> 00:23.147
Mommy! I was waiting
by the window.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.982
Can I carry the bag
with the milks?

00:24.984 --> 00:26.859
I'm really strong.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.110
[bart grunts]

00:28.904 --> 00:30.571
I drew you picture.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.114
Yes, she did.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.658
She drew it in pudding.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.869
[marge]
oh. Pretty.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.537
But we should clean that up.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.997
No!

00:39.999 --> 00:41.373
-No, no, no!
-Fine, fine, fine.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.708
-Pudding mommy can stay.
-No kill pudding mommy!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.461
You should've seen when I ate
part of ketchup daddy.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.462
[crying]
no!

00:46.464 --> 00:48.380
Look what I got.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.423
[gasps]

00:49.425 --> 00:52.051
Oh, I love you,
love you, love you.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.470
Oh, let's play bubbles now.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.554
[laughs]

00:55.556 --> 00:57.139
[laughing]

00:57.141 --> 00:59.850
This is a perfect moment.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.061
[sobbing]

01:02.897 --> 01:04.897
Marge, what's wrong?

01:04.899 --> 01:07.983
It... It's slipping away.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.684
You need to stop that.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.695
W-what did you say?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.780
Bart!

01:12.782 --> 01:14.865
-Whee! I'm flying!
-Ah! [grunts]

01:14.867 --> 01:17.993
Bart! Bart!
W-what is happening?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.663
No!

01:21.665 --> 01:22.664
Oh!

01:22.666 --> 01:24.541
Oh. [moans]

01:24.543 --> 01:26.960
Oh, no. He popped.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.047
No, no! Don't sue me, dracula!

01:30.049 --> 01:32.716
[groans] did you say something?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.093
Oh, I-I was dreaming about

01:34.095 --> 01:35.344
Those bubble parties

01:35.346 --> 01:37.429
We used to have with the kids.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.431
But I was so sad.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.100
Why were you sad?

01:41.102 --> 01:43.769
Because I knew it was gonna end.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.896
[yawns]

01:45.898 --> 01:47.689
I get it. That's why, for me,

01:47.691 --> 01:50.943
The last foot
of a six-foot party sub is...

01:50.945 --> 01:52.194
Bittersweet.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.072
[gasps] honey, you're drenched!

01:55.074 --> 01:57.282
[groans] it's bubble juice.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.369
Oh, honey,
you don't look so good.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.162
I mean, I think you look great,

02:02.164 --> 02:04.414
But someone else, say, a doctor,

02:04.416 --> 02:06.875
Might be alarmed
at your pale skin

02:06.877 --> 02:09.086
That is both hot and cold.

02:09.088 --> 02:13.215
Why did we eat at Tuesday
o'fridayhan's last night?

02:13.217 --> 02:17.136
[groans] I had three
glasses of froz-sé.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.763
And a couple froz-oody marys.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.974
[laughs] we got pretty hammered.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.143
Ugh. And then we bought hot dogs

02:24.145 --> 02:26.353
From that sketchy street vendor.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.356
Oh, but they smelled so good.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.233
-Wrapped in bacon...
-Hmm?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.734
...Sizzling in that hubcap...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.027
Oh.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.365
[retching]

02:39.243 --> 02:40.742
-Ugh.
-Homer, don't listen.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.871
We have to keep the-- [retches]

02:43.873 --> 02:46.165
Romance alive!

02:47.418 --> 02:50.627
[gasps] I wonder why
you didn't get sick.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.964
The clinical term is:
I'm all throwed up.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.382
Should we call dr. Hibbert?

02:55.384 --> 02:59.595
No, no, I-I'm good now,
it's all gone.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.013
All better.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.931
Ooh, bounce-a-thon is tomorrow.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.266
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.226
I'll call the school
in the morning.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.104
[groans] I have to go.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.064
I volunteered for three jobs

03:11.066 --> 03:14.067
On pta-martyr.Com.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.738
Frickin' pta-martyr.Com.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.865
[snores]

03:19.867 --> 03:21.658
Where is he?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.784
Peek-a-boo!

03:22.786 --> 03:24.328
[gasps] oh.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.537
[laughs]

03:25.539 --> 03:27.164
-Where is he?
-[clock ticking]

03:27.166 --> 03:29.499
Where's my special little guy?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.793
Bart? Where are you?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.378
[bart whispers]
don't let go.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.463
[whimpers]

03:34.465 --> 03:35.672
Hmm?

03:37.927 --> 03:39.384
It's okay.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.640
Your coat.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.392
-[echoing laughter]
-bart?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.687
Can somebody help me?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.314
I've lost my little boy.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.690
Bart!

03:53.692 --> 03:55.734
Oh no. I was just about to beat

03:55.736 --> 03:57.444
These mutant houseflies
at tennis.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.737
What do you want?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.615
I've lost my-my little boy.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.700
[homer]
<i> you know this is</i>
<i> a dream, right?</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:07.079
[through didgeridoo]
bee-eer-err.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.331
Well, that would explain a lot.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.832
[homer]
yeah, in the waking world,

04:10.834 --> 04:12.292
I'm not great at didgeridoo.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.086
Is this one of those dreams

04:14.088 --> 04:16.129
Where you know you're dreaming?

04:16.131 --> 04:19.049
There's a name for it,
somebody once told me...

04:19.051 --> 04:20.717
I'm the one who told you.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.094
That's right.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.971
I'm your inner lisa.

04:23.973 --> 04:27.015
I remember everything
lisa ever said to you.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.393
Exactly the way you heard it.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.062
Really? So you can tell me
what lisa said

04:32.064 --> 04:34.231
About dreaming when you know
you're dreaming?

04:34.233 --> 04:38.560
Yep. It's a scientifical
concept called "lucy dreaming."

04:38.562 --> 04:42.155
It was invented by sleep doctors
from a country somewhere.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.075
Wow. She's as smart
as old sheldon.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.244
Since this is your lucy dream,

04:47.246 --> 04:50.163
You control everything
that happens.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.166
So I'm the one making
homer an otter?

04:53.168 --> 04:56.295
Yes. He appears in many forms
in your dreams.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.880
Dad's an otter because yesterday

04:58.882 --> 05:00.299
He was lying in a kiddie pool,

05:00.301 --> 05:02.259
Eating nachos off his belly.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.886
It's a table
that's always with me.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.221
[lisa]
sometimes dad's a clown,

05:06.223 --> 05:07.889
Sometimes a potato,

05:07.891 --> 05:09.766
Sometimes a clown-potato.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.061
And sometimes, he's both
of the property brothers.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.646
-Why am I these guys?
-Why am I these guys?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.648
Never mind, I know why.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.943
But why am I having
nightmares about bart?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.320
Did something happen?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.530
How do I look
at recent memories?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.449
It's your lucy dream,
you decide.

05:25.451 --> 05:28.535
Oh. So I can decide that
all my thoughts from yesterday

05:28.537 --> 05:31.663
Are stored in,
I don't know, the oven?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.831
Sure, why not?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.124
Hmm.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.797
[marge]
hmm. Here we go.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.632
[bart]
mom! Come quick!

05:42.634 --> 05:43.800
[marge]
whoa!

05:43.802 --> 05:46.136
I'm here. I'm here, bart.
What happened?

05:46.138 --> 05:48.764
-Splinter.
-Oh. That's it?

05:48.766 --> 05:50.432
It's kind of bleeding.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.558
Maybe not.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.644
[gasps] when did your hands
get so big?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.271
They're bigger than mine.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.774
I dunno. Maybe I got
freaky-big hands.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.400
Tweeze, please.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.615
I guess it's been a while
since we held hands.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.991
Ew. Did you get it?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.993
-Hmm.
-Thanks.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.496
So that's why
you're having nightmares.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.457
Bart is super rude
and full of splinters.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.836
Maybe. Or maybe I'm just
sick off hubcap hotdogs.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.130
Why would awake-me eat those?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.383
That doesn't seem like awake-me.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.511
After enough booze slushies,
you think you can do anything.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.055
I challenged the valet
to an arm wrestle,

06:30.057 --> 06:33.100
But he turned out
to be just a sign.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.394
Why was I drinking frozen wine

06:35.396 --> 06:37.771
In a casual dining
chain restaurant

06:37.773 --> 06:39.064
On a school night?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.191
I dunno. After our meeting
with bart's teacher,

06:41.193 --> 06:42.776
You said you needed a drink.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.027
Hmm.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.405
Hmm...

06:47.783 --> 06:48.782
Whoa!

06:48.784 --> 06:50.367
Look, whatever bart did,

06:50.369 --> 06:52.953
We'll pay to have it
cleaned or replaced

06:52.955 --> 06:54.913
Or for its therapy or--

06:54.915 --> 06:56.248
Bart hasn't done anything.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.624
I'm meeting with
all the parents.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.334
Even the normal kids. Oh!

06:59.336 --> 07:00.627
Bart is normal.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.755
I-I mean, we don't say normal
anymore, I mean--

07:03.757 --> 07:05.215
I-I'm talking
to all the parents.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.884
You're not special.
I-I mean, you are, but--

07:07.886 --> 07:09.302
What did you want to talk about?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.513
As you know, bounce-a-thon means

07:11.515 --> 07:14.015
We're getting close
to the end of the year.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.017
So it's a good time
to talk about

07:16.019 --> 07:17.936
The transition to fifth grade.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.230
You know, last year
of elementary school

07:20.232 --> 07:21.773
And then it's on
to middle school and then--

07:21.775 --> 07:24.192
-Middle school?
-[rumbling]

07:24.194 --> 07:26.319
Then everything changes:

07:26.321 --> 07:30.365
Girls, acne, drugs, body odor.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.325
Listen, I've taught fifth grade.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.327
Please buy your
fifth-grader deodorant.

07:34.329 --> 07:38.373
Like, real deodorant,
not the "natural" stuff.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.293
They may look like children,
but they smell...

07:41.295 --> 07:44.629
Like nervous cab-drivers.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.132
The point is: Don't freak out.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
Okay. About what?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.052
Well, some parents
start thinking,

07:51.054 --> 07:54.473
"oh no. This is the end
of my kid's childhood."

07:54.475 --> 07:57.684
But fifth grade isn't the end
of bart's childhood, right?

07:57.686 --> 08:00.937
I mean, technically,
it is the last year of it.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.230
-[chuckles]
-[gasps]

08:02.232 --> 08:04.524
[wheezing, gasping]

08:04.526 --> 08:06.902
Did you find out
what happened to bart?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.154
It's what's going to happen.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.239
He's going to grow up.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.282
Mm.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.534
Damn kid.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.707
It was such a strange dream.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.000
Bart was four

08:22.002 --> 08:24.085
And he was so adorable.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.879
I'd almost forgotten
there was a time

08:25.881 --> 08:27.672
When bart was the sweet one,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.799
And lisa was the difficult one.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.218
[lisa]
uh, to be fair...

08:31.220 --> 08:32.636
I'm only 18 months old,

08:32.638 --> 08:35.222
So to be going through
my terrible twos now

08:35.224 --> 08:37.516
Is actually pretty advanced.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.185
Crap, I'm still dreaming!

08:40.187 --> 08:43.146
[gasps] bounce-a-thon!

08:44.858 --> 08:46.274
I'm coming, too!

08:46.276 --> 08:47.692
-[lisa] yay!
-[bart] aren't you sick?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.902
I thought I heard you barfing.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.071
No, that wasn't barfing.

08:51.073 --> 08:55.325
That was... Loud,
sloshy burps-- [gags]

08:55.327 --> 08:56.159
[both]
ugh.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.577
I signed up for snack,

08:57.579 --> 08:59.579
So I have to make
marshmallow trea--

08:59.581 --> 09:01.706
[gags] I can do this.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.792
Just have to melt
some margari-- [gags]

09:03.794 --> 09:06.294
Don't worry.
Super-dad is already

09:06.296 --> 09:08.046
Making the marshmallow treats.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.424
Which krispies did you use?
Rice or cocoa?

09:11.426 --> 09:15.220
I'm making my own. The rice
is krispying as we speak.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.997
I missed the picture,

19:25.999 --> 19:29.167
But lisa was so happy
to see me today.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.419
So, for now, I'm happy.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.296
And who knows
what the future holds?

19:33.298 --> 19:35.298
Bart could knock up
his high school girlfriend.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.507
You could have grandchildren

19:36.509 --> 19:38.759
Before maggie
starts kindergarten.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.137
Wouldn't that be nice?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.225
[sighs] time to wake up.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.351
[pops]

19:47.979 --> 19:50.354
[gasps] oh.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.356
[cheering]

19:52.358 --> 19:53.649
Here he comes.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.653
Mm. My funny little guy.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.657
[clicks]

20:01.659 --> 20:02.909
[gasping]

20:02.911 --> 20:04.452
Oh...

20:04.454 --> 20:06.913
[laughs] that's...

20:06.915 --> 20:09.415
That's really good.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.499
[laughs]

20:10.501 --> 20:12.627
[panting] did you
get the picture?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.003
Was my crack centered?

20:14.005 --> 20:16.964
Oh, bart, it was perfect.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.424
You liked it?

20:18.426 --> 20:20.384
I loved it.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.553
Thanks. Wanna go
to the dunk tank?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.722
The gym teacher I hate
is on the chair.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.557
Sure. [gasps]

20:28.102 --> 20:29.435
[bart chuckles]

20:30.563 --> 20:33.147
Let's dunk that sucker.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.692
[marge sniffs]

20:36.694 --> 20:37.860
And on the way home,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.528
Let's go deodorant shopping.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.073
