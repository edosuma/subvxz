[bored teenager over p.A.]
<i> attention, shoppers,</i>
<i> a mother's love is forever,</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:11.260
<i> But mother's love rat poison</i>

00:11.262 --> 00:13.470
<i> Is only on sale</i>
<i> till the end of the day.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:16.598
Aw.

00:17.727 --> 00:20.060
[birds singing]

00:20.062 --> 00:23.147
Mommy! I was waiting
by the window.

00:23.149 --> 00:24.982
Can I carry the bag
with the milks?

00:24.984 --> 00:26.859
I'm really strong.

00:26.861 --> 00:28.110
[bart grunts]

00:28.904 --> 00:30.571
I drew you picture.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.114
Yes, she did.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.658
She drew it in pudding.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.869
[marge]
oh. Pretty.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.537
But we should clean that up.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.997
No!

00:39.999 --> 00:41.373
-No, no, no!
-Fine, fine, fine.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.708
-Pudding mommy can stay.
-No kill pudding mommy!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.461
You should've seen when I ate
part of ketchup daddy.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.462
[crying]
no!

00:46.464 --> 00:48.380
Look what I got.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.423
[gasps]

00:49.425 --> 00:52.051
Oh, I love you,
love you, love you.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.470
Oh, let's play bubbles now.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.554
[laughs]

00:55.556 --> 00:57.139
[laughing]

00:57.141 --> 00:59.850
This is a perfect moment.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.061
[sobbing]

01:02.897 --> 01:04.897
Marge, what's wrong?

01:04.899 --> 01:07.983
It... It's slipping away.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.684
You need to stop that.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.695
W-what did you say?

01:11.697 --> 01:12.780
Bart!

01:12.782 --> 01:14.865
-Whee! I'm flying!
-Ah! [grunts]

01:14.867 --> 01:17.993
Bart! Bart!
W-what is happening?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.663
No!

01:21.665 --> 01:22.664
Oh!

01:22.666 --> 01:24.541
Oh. [moans]

01:24.543 --> 01:26.960
Oh, no. He popped.

01:26.962 --> 01:30.047
No, no! Don't sue me, dracula!

01:30.049 --> 01:32.716
[groans] did you say something?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.093
Oh, I-I was dreaming about

01:34.095 --> 01:35.344
Those bubble parties

01:35.346 --> 01:37.429
We used to have with the kids.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.431
But I was so sad.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.100
Why were you sad?

01:41.102 --> 01:43.769
Because I knew it was gonna end.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.896
[yawns]

01:45.898 --> 01:47.689
I get it. That's why, for me,

01:47.691 --> 01:50.943
The last foot
of a six-foot party sub is...

01:50.945 --> 01:52.194
Bittersweet.

01:52.196 --> 01:55.072
[gasps] honey, you're drenched!

01:55.074 --> 01:57.282
[groans] it's bubble juice.

01:57.284 --> 02:00.369
Oh, honey,
you don't look so good.

02:00.371 --> 02:02.162
I mean, I think you look great,

02:02.164 --> 02:04.414
But someone else, say, a doctor,

02:04.416 --> 02:06.875
Might be alarmed
at your pale skin

02:06.877 --> 02:09.086
That is both hot and cold.

02:09.088 --> 02:13.215
Why did we eat at Tuesday
o'fridayhan's last night?

02:13.217 --> 02:17.136
[groans] I had three
glasses of froz-sÃ©.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.763
And a couple froz-oody marys.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.974
[laughs] we got pretty hammered.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.143
Ugh. And then we bought hot dogs

02:24.145 --> 02:26.353
From that sketchy street vendor.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.356
Oh, but they smelled so good.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.233
-Wrapped in bacon...
-Hmm?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.734
...Sizzling in that hubcap...

02:32.736 --> 02:34.027
Oh.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.365
[retching]

02:39.243 --> 02:40.742
-Ugh.
-Homer, don't listen.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.871
We have to keep the-- [retches]

02:43.873 --> 02:46.165
Romance alive!

02:47.418 --> 02:50.627
[gasps] I wonder why
you didn't get sick.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.964
The clinical term is:
I'm all throwed up.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.382
Should we call dr. Hibbert?

02:55.384 --> 02:59.595
No, no, I-I'm good now,
it's all gone.

02:59.597 --> 03:01.013
All better.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.931
Ooh, bounce-a-thon is tomorrow.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.266
I don't think
you're gonna make it.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.226
I'll call the school
in the morning.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.104
[groans] I have to go.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.064
I volunteered for three jobs

03:11.066 --> 03:14.067
On pta-martyr.Com.

03:14.069 --> 03:17.738
Frickin' pta-martyr.Com.

03:17.740 --> 03:19.865
[snores]

03:19.867 --> 03:21.658
Where is he?

03:21.660 --> 03:22.784
Peek-a-boo!

03:22.786 --> 03:24.328
[gasps] oh.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.537
[laughs]

03:25.539 --> 03:27.164
-Where is he?
-[clock ticking]

03:27.166 --> 03:29.499
Where's my special little guy?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.793
Bart? Where are you?

03:31.795 --> 03:33.378
[bart whispers]
don't let go.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.463
[whimpers]

03:34.465 --> 03:35.672
Hmm?

03:37.927 --> 03:39.384
It's okay.

03:43.349 --> 03:44.640
Your coat.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.392
-[echoing laughter]
-bart?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.687
Can somebody help me?

03:50.689 --> 03:52.314
I've lost my little boy.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.690
Bart!

03:53.692 --> 03:55.734
Oh no. I was just about to beat

03:55.736 --> 03:57.444
These mutant houseflies
at tennis.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.737
What do you want?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.615
I've lost my-my little boy.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.700
[homer]
<i> you know this is</i>
<i> a dream, right?</i>

04:04.703 --> 04:07.079
[through didgeridoo]
bee-eer-err.

04:07.081 --> 04:09.331
Well, that would explain a lot.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.832
[homer]
yeah, in the waking world,

04:10.834 --> 04:12.292
I'm not great at didgeridoo.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.086
Is this one of those dreams

04:14.088 --> 04:16.129
Where you know you're dreaming?

04:16.131 --> 04:19.049
There's a name for it,
somebody once told me...

04:19.051 --> 04:20.717
I'm the one who told you.

04:20.719 --> 04:22.094
That's right.

04:22.096 --> 04:23.971
I'm your inner lisa.

04:23.973 --> 04:27.015
I remember everything
lisa ever said to you.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.393
Exactly the way you heard it.

04:29.395 --> 04:32.062
Really? So you can tell me
what lisa said

04:32.064 --> 04:34.231
About dreaming when you know
you're dreaming?

04:34.233 --> 04:38.560
Yep. It's a scientifical
concept called "lucy dreaming."

04:38.562 --> 04:42.155
It was invented by sleep doctors
from a country somewhere.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.075
Wow. She's as smart
as old sheldon.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.244
Since this is your lucy dream,

04:47.246 --> 04:50.163
You control everything
that happens.

04:50.165 --> 04:53.166
So I'm the one making
homer an otter?

04:53.168 --> 04:56.295
Yes. He appears in many forms
in your dreams.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.880
Dad's an otter because yesterday

04:58.882 --> 05:00.299
He was lying in a kiddie pool,

05:00.301 --> 05:02.259
Eating nachos off his belly.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.886
It's a table
that's always with me.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.221
[lisa]
sometimes dad's a clown,

05:06.223 --> 05:07.889
Sometimes a potato,

05:07.891 --> 05:09.766
Sometimes a clown-potato.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.061
And sometimes, he's both
of the property brothers.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.646
-Why am I these guys?
-Why am I these guys?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.648
Never mind, I know why.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.943
But why am I having
nightmares about bart?

05:19.945 --> 05:21.320
Did something happen?

05:21.322 --> 05:23.530
How do I look
at recent memories?

05:23.532 --> 05:25.449
It's your lucy dream,
you decide.

05:25.451 --> 05:28.535
Oh. So I can decide that
all my thoughts from yesterday

05:28.537 --> 05:31.663
Are stored in,
I don't know, the oven?

05:31.665 --> 05:32.831
Sure, why not?

05:32.833 --> 05:34.124
Hmm.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.797
[marge]
hmm. Here we go.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.632
[bart]
mom! Come quick!

05:42.634 --> 05:43.800
[marge]
whoa!

05:43.802 --> 05:46.136
I'm here. I'm here, bart.
What happened?

05:46.138 --> 05:48.764
-Splinter.
-Oh. That's it?

05:48.766 --> 05:50.432
It's kind of bleeding.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.558
Maybe not.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.644
[gasps] when did your hands
get so big?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.271
They're bigger than mine.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.774
I dunno. Maybe I got
freaky-big hands.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.400
Tweeze, please.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.615
I guess it's been a while
since we held hands.

06:06.617 --> 06:07.991
Ew. Did you get it?

06:07.993 --> 06:09.993
-Hmm.
-Thanks.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.496
So that's why
you're having nightmares.

06:12.498 --> 06:15.457
Bart is super rude
and full of splinters.

06:15.459 --> 06:19.836
Maybe. Or maybe I'm just
sick off hubcap hotdogs.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.130
Why would awake-me eat those?

06:22.132 --> 06:24.383
That doesn't seem like awake-me.

06:24.385 --> 06:27.511
After enough booze slushies,
you think you can do anything.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.055
I challenged the valet
to an arm wrestle,

06:30.057 --> 06:33.100
But he turned out
to be just a sign.

06:33.102 --> 06:35.394
Why was I drinking frozen wine

06:35.396 --> 06:37.771
In a casual dining
chain restaurant

06:37.773 --> 06:39.064
On a school night?

06:39.066 --> 06:41.191
I dunno. After our meeting
with bart's teacher,

06:41.193 --> 06:42.776
You said you needed a drink.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.027
Hmm.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.405
Hmm...

06:47.783 --> 06:48.782
Whoa!

06:48.784 --> 06:50.367
Look, whatever bart did,

06:50.369 --> 06:52.953
We'll pay to have it
cleaned or replaced

06:52.955 --> 06:54.913
Or for its therapy or--

06:54.915 --> 06:56.248
Bart hasn't done anything.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.624
I'm meeting with
all the parents.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.334
Even the normal kids. Oh!

06:59.336 --> 07:00.627
Bart is normal.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.755
I-I mean, we don't say normal
anymore, I mean--

07:03.757 --> 07:05.215
I-I'm talking
to all the parents.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.884
You're not special.
I-I mean, you are, but--

07:07.886 --> 07:09.302
What did you want to talk about?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.513
As you know, bounce-a-thon means

07:11.515 --> 07:14.015
We're getting close
to the end of the year.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.017
So it's a good time
to talk about

07:16.019 --> 07:17.936
The transition to fifth grade.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.230
You know, last year
of elementary school

07:20.232 --> 07:21.773
And then it's on
to middle school and then--

07:21.775 --> 07:24.192
-Middle school?
-[rumbling]

07:24.194 --> 07:26.319
Then everything changes:

07:26.321 --> 07:30.365
Girls, acne, drugs, body odor.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.325
Listen, I've taught fifth grade.

07:32.327 --> 07:34.327
Please buy your
fifth-grader deodorant.

07:34.329 --> 07:38.373
Like, real deodorant,
not the "natural" stuff.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.293
They may look like children,
but they smell...

07:41.295 --> 07:44.629
Like nervous cab-drivers.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.132
The point is: Don't freak out.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.468
Okay. About what?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.052
Well, some parents
start thinking,

07:51.054 --> 07:54.473
"oh no. This is the end
of my kid's childhood."

07:54.475 --> 07:57.684
But fifth grade isn't the end
of bart's childhood, right?

07:57.686 --> 08:00.937
I mean, technically,
it is the last year of it.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.230
-[chuckles]
-[gasps]

08:02.232 --> 08:04.524
[wheezing, gasping]

08:04.526 --> 08:06.902
Did you find out
what happened to bart?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.154
It's what's going to happen.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.239
He's going to grow up.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.282
Mm.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.534
Damn kid.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.707
It was such a strange dream.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.000
Bart was four

08:22.002 --> 08:24.085
And he was so adorable.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.879
I'd almost forgotten
there was a time

08:25.881 --> 08:27.672
When bart was the sweet one,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.799
And lisa was the difficult one.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.218
[lisa]
uh, to be fair...

08:31.220 --> 08:32.636
I'm only 18 months old,

08:32.638 --> 08:35.222
So to be going through
my terrible twos now

08:35.224 --> 08:37.516
Is actually pretty advanced.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.185
Crap, I'm still dreaming!

08:40.187 --> 08:43.146
[gasps] bounce-a-thon!

08:44.858 --> 08:46.274
I'm coming, too!

08:46.276 --> 08:47.692
-[lisa] yay!
-[bart] aren't you sick?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.902
I thought I heard you barfing.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.071
No, that wasn't barfing.

08:51.073 --> 08:55.325
That was... Loud,
sloshy burps-- [gags]

08:55.327 --> 08:56.159
[both]
ugh.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.577
I signed up for snack,

08:57.579 --> 08:59.579
So I have to make
marshmallow trea--

08:59.581 --> 09:01.706
[gags] I can do this.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.792
Just have to melt
some margari-- [gags]

09:03.794 --> 09:06.294
Don't worry.
Super-dad is already

09:06.296 --> 09:08.046
Making the marshmallow treats.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.424
Which krispies did you use?
Rice or cocoa?

09:11.426 --> 09:15.220
I'm making my own. The rice
is krispying as we speak.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.221
[pops]

09:16.431 --> 09:18.848
[gags] oh, it smells
like you've burnt it!

09:18.850 --> 09:22.394
No problem, I'll moisten it
with the last of the eggnog.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.146
[gags]

09:26.233 --> 09:29.067
I'm throwing up stuff
I ate years ago.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.194
I think I saw wedding cake.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.196
You really should stay home.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.574
Oh, maybe you're right. [groans]

09:35.576 --> 09:38.952
This will be the first
bounce-a-thon I've ever missed.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.996
Oh, missing stuff
is the greatest.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.372
When I do stuff,

09:42.374 --> 09:44.791
I have a fear of missing out
on missing out.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.710
You know:
Fo-moo-mo.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.296
Homer, listen, you have
to do this for me.

09:49.298 --> 09:51.298
Take a picture of each kid

09:51.300 --> 09:53.967
Giving a thumbs-up
at the finish line.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.552
It's for my scrapbook.

09:55.554 --> 09:58.513
I've already made windows
for each school year.

09:58.515 --> 10:02.559
[groans] bart,
thumbs-up slowly past daddy.

10:02.561 --> 10:03.810
Give him time to focus.

10:04.896 --> 10:08.064
Mom, there's no easy way
to tell you this,

10:08.066 --> 10:09.774
So I'm just gonna say it.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.777
At school, I'm becoming known
for taking cutting-edge,

10:12.779 --> 10:14.654
No-holds-barred comedy photos.

10:14.656 --> 10:15.947
It's true.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.325
I've heard fifth graders say so.

10:18.327 --> 10:20.660
So, w-what are you saying?

10:20.662 --> 10:23.830
There's no way I can do
a thumbs-up at bounce-a-thon.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.999
-What?
-It will ruin the brand

10:26.001 --> 10:28.126
I've been building
since picture day.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.795
My fans expect me to top
inside-out eyelids

10:30.797 --> 10:32.255
And scotch tape nose.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.132
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.426
But this is for
the bounce-a-thon album.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.220
So you'll always
remember bounce-a-thon.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.265
But I don't even
like bounce-a-thon.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.644
I'm making fun of bounce-a-thon.

10:45.646 --> 10:46.853
What?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.439
None of us kids
like bounce-a-thon.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.066
It's not very cool.

10:51.068 --> 10:54.569
Well, you thought
it was cool last year.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.406
Bart, just one thumbs-up,
please?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.532
[groans]

10:59.534 --> 11:01.326
I'm sorry, but no.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.662
Crazy pictures is my thing now.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.248
You should respect that this
is just how I am this year.

11:07.250 --> 11:11.169
Bart, you sound so mature
and grown up.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.880
[crying]
I hate that.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.840
[sobs]

11:15.842 --> 11:18.051
[snores]

11:20.764 --> 11:21.763
[loud growling]

11:21.765 --> 11:22.889
Run!

11:22.891 --> 11:24.432
-Something's coming!
-[gasps]

11:24.851 --> 11:27.268
[panting]

11:27.270 --> 11:29.771
This is silly.
I don't need symbolism.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.314
I know what I'm afraid of.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.900
And it's not a bear. Sorry.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.194
[grumbling]

11:36.196 --> 11:39.114
[sighs] it's not a nightmare.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.448
It's reality.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.950
Bart's growing up.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.993
I should've treasured every time

11:43.995 --> 11:46.246
He held my hand because...

11:46.248 --> 11:48.790
I don't remember
when he stopped.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.127
The poet kahlil gibran
once said:

11:53.672 --> 11:55.505
Parents are bows...

11:55.507 --> 11:57.757
Like bow-and-arrow bows?

11:57.759 --> 12:02.804
...From which children are
shot forth as an arrow-thingy.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.181
The bow doesn't feel sad
when it sees

12:05.183 --> 12:07.767
How far and true
the arrow flies.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.770
Well, the bow feels
a little sad.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.731
The bow doesn't
want to lose touch

12:12.733 --> 12:16.526
And the arrow has never been
great about answering texts.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.819
[snaps]

12:17.821 --> 12:19.446
But even after bart grows up,

12:19.448 --> 12:21.364
You'll still have lisa
and maggie...

12:21.366 --> 12:24.784
Oh, my god. Lisa and maggie!

12:24.786 --> 12:27.287
It's going to happen
with all of them!

12:27.289 --> 12:28.371
Oops.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.081
[rumbling]

12:30.083 --> 12:31.958
Bart is just the beginning.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.334
[rumbling]

12:34.838 --> 12:36.838
One by one...

12:36.840 --> 12:38.631
[rumbling]

12:38.633 --> 12:39.632
...All my babies

12:39.634 --> 12:40.967
Will leave the nest.

12:40.969 --> 12:42.260
[rumbling]

12:43.722 --> 12:45.722
I'm going to lose all of them.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.599
âª

12:55.442 --> 12:58.526
Honey, we mustn't break
awake-you's brain.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.779
Remember those commercials
where they show you

13:00.781 --> 13:02.363
What depression is like?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.949
A raincloud
follows you everywhere,

13:04.951 --> 13:06.868
You get sucked into sofas,

13:06.870 --> 13:08.328
And when it gets really bad,

13:08.330 --> 13:10.997
Your wind-up monkey
stops clapping.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.874
[gasps] look!

13:12.876 --> 13:14.793
Look, bart's at a playground!

13:14.795 --> 13:16.377
Bart! Bart!
They have your favorite

13:16.379 --> 13:18.338
Back-and-forth riding-thingy!

13:18.340 --> 13:21.424
The duck, bart! Ride the duck!

13:21.426 --> 13:22.717
Bart!

13:22.719 --> 13:23.885
[clicks]

13:23.887 --> 13:27.180
No!

13:29.684 --> 13:33.144
Okay, maybe I am being
a teensy bit negative.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.651
[homer sniffing] okay.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.444
A little brain-hurricane.

13:41.446 --> 13:45.573
My time as a mom will
eventually come to an end.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.619
I'll have to fill my days
with a bunch of stupid hobbies.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.664
I don't want an etsy storefront!

13:52.666 --> 13:54.415
It's not happening now.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.001
So it's silly
to be sad about it now.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.629
It's like going to work on time.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.798
There's no point.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.591
I want to show you something.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.181
Whoa!

14:11.601 --> 14:13.017
I'm coming, too.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.269
-[lisa] yay!
-[bart] aren't you sick?

14:14.271 --> 14:15.895
I thought I heard you barfing.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.188
Freeze it right there.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.526
Now, watch it again
but this time look over...

14:21.528 --> 14:22.193
Here.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.571
[dialogue rewinding]

14:24.573 --> 14:25.822
I'm coming, too.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.781
-Yay!
-[bart] aren't you sick?

14:27.284 --> 14:28.491
-âª<i> mommy's coming</i> âª
-I thought I heard you barfing.

14:28.493 --> 14:29.450
âª<i> yes, she is</i> âª

14:29.452 --> 14:31.077
âª<i> do, do-do, do, do, my mom.</i> âª

14:31.079 --> 14:32.954
[grunts] ha!

14:32.956 --> 14:35.832
She's rehearsing her thumbs-up.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.958
Oh.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.293
Oh, I was so sad

14:38.295 --> 14:40.211
That bart had outgrown
the bounce-a-thon,

14:40.213 --> 14:43.840
I couldn't see that
my sweet lisa still loves it.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.008
For now.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.260
Next year, she'll probably
turn on it, too.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.511
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you

14:48.513 --> 14:50.722
To get out of
the dark place, please.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.514
You're right.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.684
Bounce-a-thon
still means a lot to lisa.

14:54.686 --> 14:58.187
So, what are you--
like, my feelings police?

14:58.189 --> 15:01.107
No, I'm pretty sure I'm here
because, deep down,

15:01.109 --> 15:02.483
You're attracted to me.

15:02.485 --> 15:05.153
The uniform,
the low center of gravity,

15:05.155 --> 15:07.697
My thick, syrupy voice.
[chuckles]

15:07.699 --> 15:09.324
I don't think so.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.992
If anything, I'm into eddie.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.620
Yeah, he's a beautiful man.

15:13.622 --> 15:18.041
I love that lisa was so happy
I was gonna be there.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.959
I should be there for her.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.128
I've got to get
to the bounce-a-thon

15:22.130 --> 15:24.589
Before lisa's childhood
slips away.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.674
How can I wake myself up?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.551
Oh. Well, this'll do it.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.722
[gasps]

15:33.642 --> 15:36.559
Okay, looking good,
feeling good.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.019
[gags]

15:38.021 --> 15:38.728
[retches]

15:38.730 --> 15:40.021
[pants]

15:40.815 --> 15:42.315
Even better now.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.777
I'll be there, lisa,
I won't miss it.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.654
[voice over radio]
<i> or a pickle and egg sandwich</i>

15:47.656 --> 15:50.615
<i> From joey mayonnaise's</i>
<i> sandwich creamery!</i>

15:50.617 --> 15:54.452
<i> Where the hospitality is</i>
<i> as warm as the mayonnai--</i>

15:54.454 --> 15:55.995
[grunting]

15:58.208 --> 16:00.833
Okay, I ruined the car.

16:00.835 --> 16:03.628
But mommy's
s-still coming, lisa.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.090
Okay, here we go.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.636
Oh, I got to sign up.
Okay. Username?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.638
Uh, bounce-mom.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.515
Taken. Fine.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.392
Uh, barf-mom.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.935
Taken? Really?

16:18.937 --> 16:21.020
Borf-mom.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.272
What? Oh, come on.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.857
Marge.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.693
Oh, that worked.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.992
[retches]

16:36.287 --> 16:37.495
[retches]

16:40.000 --> 16:41.541
Ah! [gasps]

16:41.543 --> 16:43.167
I'm here, lisa.

16:44.462 --> 16:48.381
I promised to wear this, uh,
humorous wig for bounce-a-thon

16:48.383 --> 16:50.800
If we had 30 lice-free days
and, uh, well,

16:50.802 --> 16:53.594
We had 29, but I'm just
going to assume that today

16:53.596 --> 16:54.887
Is going to go well.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.015
And on the bounce track
right now,

16:57.017 --> 16:58.933
The second grade.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.185
[gasps] that's lisa's class.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.898
Excuse me, excuse me.
Let me through.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.026
I'm here to support my child.

17:08.028 --> 17:10.403
Yeah, well, guess what,
princess blue,

17:10.405 --> 17:13.197
We're all here
to support our kids.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.117
So stick that in your g-string
and make change.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.078
I'm sorry, I'm very, very sick
and I just--

17:19.080 --> 17:21.330
Sick? W-what kind of sick?

17:21.332 --> 17:23.958
I don't know. Some kind of, um,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.711
I don't know, pox or plague.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.379
[anxious murmuring]

17:28.381 --> 17:29.589
[marge chuckles]

17:30.967 --> 17:32.800
[sniffs]

17:32.802 --> 17:34.927
Oh, no. Food smells.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.763
It's okay,
I'll just hold my breath.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.181
[inhales]

17:44.981 --> 17:48.107
Must... Get... Picture.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.740
[peyton]
mrs. Simpson?

17:56.993 --> 17:59.285
D-did I get the picture?

18:02.499 --> 18:05.333
I took a photo
after I passed out?

18:05.335 --> 18:09.337
Yeah, we had to pry the phone
from your hand.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.631
I've been kind of a wreck
since our meeting.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.051
You know, when you said
bart's childhood is over?

18:15.053 --> 18:18.888
[gasps] I did not say that.
I would never say that.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.349
Bart's childhood isn't over.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.060
I did notice
that you got very quiet

18:24.062 --> 18:26.270
After I mentioned middle school.

18:26.272 --> 18:28.272
You didn't say anything else.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.651
Except to ask about happy hour
at Tuesday o'fridayhan's.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.695
Wait, you didn't say
he was heading toward

18:34.697 --> 18:36.948
Girls and drugs and acne?

18:36.950 --> 18:39.659
No, of course not.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.494
Oh, my gosh, that was a dream.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.914
I should have noticed
that you were 17 feet tall.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.209
I ate bad things last night.

18:48.211 --> 18:51.295
You didn't say we had to
buy bart deodorant next year.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.797
Oh, no, no, no, I did say that.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.882
That part is very important.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.301
Strong deodorant.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.930
Hey, bart's got
a lot of childhood left.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.850
I mean, he scores
in the 50th percentile

19:03.852 --> 19:05.059
For knowing his right and left,

19:05.061 --> 19:07.145
Which is, oh, not a test score

19:07.147 --> 19:09.522
I should have said out loud
at a school function.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.898
[sighs]

19:10.900 --> 19:12.692
Are you going to be okay?

19:12.694 --> 19:15.361
Yes. I'm just going to lie here

19:15.363 --> 19:18.781
Until the school
stops spinning...

19:18.783 --> 19:20.658
[snores]

19:20.660 --> 19:21.701
Ah.

19:21.703 --> 19:22.994
Feeling better?

19:22.996 --> 19:24.662
Mm-hmm.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.997
I missed the picture,

19:25.999 --> 19:29.167
But lisa was so happy
to see me today.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.419
So, for now, I'm happy.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.296
And who knows
what the future holds?

19:33.298 --> 19:35.298
Bart could knock up
his high school girlfriend.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.507
You could have grandchildren

19:36.509 --> 19:38.759
Before maggie
starts kindergarten.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.137
Wouldn't that be nice?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.225
[sighs] time to wake up.

19:46.227 --> 19:47.351
[pops]

19:47.979 --> 19:50.354
[gasps] oh.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.356
[cheering]

19:52.358 --> 19:53.649
Here he comes.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.653
Mm. My funny little guy.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.657
[clicks]

20:01.659 --> 20:02.909
[gasping]

20:02.911 --> 20:04.452
Oh...

20:04.454 --> 20:06.913
[laughs] that's...

20:06.915 --> 20:09.415
That's really good.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.499
[laughs]

20:10.501 --> 20:12.627
[panting] did you
get the picture?

20:12.629 --> 20:14.003
Was my crack centered?

20:14.005 --> 20:16.964
Oh, bart, it was perfect.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.424
You liked it?

20:18.426 --> 20:20.384
I loved it.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.553
Thanks. Wanna go
to the dunk tank?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.722
The gym teacher I hate
is on the chair.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.557
Sure. [gasps]

20:28.102 --> 20:29.435
[bart chuckles]

20:30.563 --> 20:33.147
Let's dunk that sucker.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.692
[marge sniffs]

20:36.694 --> 20:37.860
And on the way home,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.528
Let's go deodorant shopping.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.073
