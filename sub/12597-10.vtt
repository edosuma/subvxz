00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:05.106 --> 00:07.006
Hey, joey.
Want to have a contest

00:07.008 --> 00:08.474
To see who can punch
the lightest?

00:08.476 --> 00:09.708
Cha.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.111
Get out
of my brain, bro.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.384
Boop!
(chuckles)

00:18.386 --> 00:20.352
Feather tap.
Beat that, brother man.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.554
Ow!

00:22.556 --> 00:25.991
Darn, I lose.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.293
Oh, sick.
Are we playing "who can
punch the lightest"?

00:28.295 --> 00:29.962
Mm-hmm.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.564
Ow!

00:32.566 --> 00:35.067
Oh, darn.
Looks like I lose.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.702
(laughs)

00:36.704 --> 00:39.304
Are we doing that thing
where we pretend to punch
joey really lightly

00:39.306 --> 00:41.673
But really we
punch him really hard?
Because I love that game.

00:41.675 --> 00:43.675
Wait,

00:43.677 --> 00:45.878
Is this what we've been
doing the whole time?

00:47.014 --> 00:48.480
Am I winning
or losing?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.418
Nah, I'm winning.

00:53.587 --> 00:54.987
(blows air horn)

00:54.989 --> 00:56.722
Family meeting!

00:56.724 --> 00:58.590
We have two
big announcements.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.859
Okay, first, parker has
some exciting news,

01:00.861 --> 01:02.928
And then dad has
something to share.

01:04.231 --> 01:07.099
Tomorrow, in keeping
with the warp-speed
trajectory

01:07.101 --> 01:09.101
Of my academic
awesomeness,

01:09.103 --> 01:10.903
I'm transferring
schools

01:10.905 --> 01:12.905
To be a full-time student
at ridgewood high.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.940
-(gasps)
-what?

01:14.942 --> 01:17.943
We decided
to move parker up
a couple grade levels

01:17.945 --> 01:20.746
Because he wasn't being
challenged academically.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.048
In middle school,
I was so far ahead,

01:23.050 --> 01:25.384
I was teaching
three classes,

01:25.386 --> 01:28.220
Which was fine
until I walked into
the teachers' lounge

01:28.222 --> 01:30.689
And caught mrs. Mueller
rifling through my lunch.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.592
Keep your paws
off my fruit leather, lady.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.294
Oh, that is so awesome.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.362
I'm so proud of you,
little bro.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.298
Yeah, dude, we'll totally
take you under our wings.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.934
No, no, don't support him.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.038
This is a disaster
waiting to happen.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.373
Parker will take
what you love,

01:48.375 --> 01:51.110
He will make it
his own,

01:51.112 --> 01:53.645
And then he'll
leave you scrambling
to reinvent yourself.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.417
Is this about
the badger scouts again?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.352
Of course it's about
the badger scouts again.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.289
When I was
a badger scout,

02:04.291 --> 02:07.092
Parker joined my burrow.
And within one month,

02:07.094 --> 02:09.962
He earned
all the badger badges.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.763
This is parker's sash.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.398
Yeah.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.767
And this is mine.

02:15.769 --> 02:19.471
That badge is for having
the coolest brother--

02:19.473 --> 02:21.340
(voice breaks)
the one badge
parker never got.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.912
You will rue the day
that parker came
to ridgewood!

02:26.914 --> 02:28.480
Rue the day,
I say!

02:28.482 --> 02:30.816
Okay, joey, calm down.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.452
Yeah, you are, like,
totally overreacting.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.420
(mockingly)
and you are, like,
totally under-reacting.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.690
Family meeting over.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.826
(blows air horn)

02:40.828 --> 02:44.463
Pete, honey,
what happened?

02:44.465 --> 02:47.533
I thought you were gonna
tell the kids about your
new job offer.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.602
Well, let's let parker
get through his first week
of high school.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.604
Honey, you are worrying
for nothing.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.374
We have raised
a very mature

02:55.376 --> 02:57.276
And supportive
family unit.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.443
(door opens)

02:58.445 --> 03:00.512
(whines)
mom.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.052
Uh, pa-- parker dared me
to-- to hug a cactus.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.587
I did it.

I am so happy that
you're here full-time.

04:10.551 --> 04:14.419
I have taken the liberty
of decorating your locker.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.568

04:29.570 --> 04:31.570
Once I've established
myself,

04:31.572 --> 04:34.640
I can be more open
with my love for m'gurls.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.676
Thanks though.
You get me.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.446
Hey, bro.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.548
After a good night's sleep
and a hearty breakfast,

04:43.550 --> 04:45.550
I have come
to fully accept you

04:45.552 --> 04:48.654
As a full-time
porcupine.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.589
Some brotherly
advice though--
we have pe next period,

04:50.591 --> 04:53.091
So hydrate now.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.560
(laughing)

04:55.562 --> 04:56.962
That water fountain

04:56.964 --> 04:59.431
Sprays anyone
who uses it.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.033
Parker's gonna
get soaked.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.802
Welcome to high school,
little bro.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.909
No water.
Must be broken.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.844
Not a good way
to start my day.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.579
What?

05:14.581 --> 05:16.315
Let me see that.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.120
I take that back.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.489
It was the perfect way
to start my day.

05:29.029 --> 05:32.097
Liv, I'm so glad
you're not shooting
<i>voltage </i> this week,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.599
So you could
be here for this.
Look what showed up.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.636
The senior class gift
we're leaving
for ridgewood.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.970
Yes!

05:38.972 --> 05:41.540
Okay, let it just
be known

05:41.542 --> 05:43.709
That the class of 2016
is leaving

05:43.711 --> 05:45.911
The best
senior class gift ever.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.880
Really cool ficus tree
in the library,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.716
Class of 2009.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.684
Pssh.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.119
Hey, that beats 2012.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.721
Their senior class gift

05:55.723 --> 05:57.489
Was that bench
on the stairs.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.725
I mean, who needs a break
between floors?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.568
Yeah, now I know.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.970
Okay, okay,
let's open it up.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.739
I want to see
our super-sized

06:13.741 --> 06:16.074
"welcome to ridgewood high"
sign.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.478
I told them
to spare no expense
with packing it.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.480
I cannot wait to see
how magnificent it looks

06:21.482 --> 06:22.948
Hanging up
above the lobby.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.959
Wha--
no--

06:34.895 --> 06:37.829
Okay, the sign
that I ordered

06:37.831 --> 06:39.831
Was four feet
by eight feet.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.867
Well, this is

06:41.869 --> 06:44.202
Four inches
by eight inches.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.772
You got the four
and the eight part right.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.306
That's something.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.943
This can't be our
senior class gift.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.347
I'm starting to feel like
we were a little harsh
on that ficus tree.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.694
Hey, how sick is this?

07:09.696 --> 07:11.630
I get to have pe
with my favorite bro.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.033
I can hear you
over here.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.936
I know.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.806
Hey, how is your first
day at school going?

07:20.808 --> 07:22.574
It's okay so far.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.409
I was named captain
of the science squad.

07:24.411 --> 07:27.813
Wasn't that
your old job, joseph?

07:27.815 --> 07:30.415
Parker is killing it
in high school.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.751
Almost makes me forget
your ill-advised

07:32.753 --> 07:34.619
First-day-of-school
hairdo.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.621
Luckily, I had
the minions render

07:36.623 --> 07:39.357
Your feathered mullet
in pastels.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.896
Bad-in-the-front-and-
worse-in-the-back burn.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.099
(blows whistle)
all right, class.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.837
Today we will be doing
the flexed-arm hang.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.905
Ooh, this is gonna be
fun for you.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.408
You'll get to see
the champ in action.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.410
Or...

07:58.412 --> 08:00.212
Maybe there will be
a new champ.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.083
It's happening.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.525
Down to parker
and maddie.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.027
Who will be out next
flexed-arm champion?

08:16.029 --> 08:18.029
(exhaling)

08:18.031 --> 08:20.499
How long are you gonna
put yourself through this?

08:20.501 --> 08:22.801
I can see those
tiny little biceps
starting to shake,

08:22.803 --> 08:24.669
And I can do this
all day long.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.871
(exhales)

08:25.873 --> 08:28.273
(exhales)
dang it.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.475
Ha!
Guess I win.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.643
Bam!

08:31.645 --> 08:33.545
Oh, I need my arms
for that.
Hold on.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.882
Bam!
What?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.317
Ha-ha!
Whoo!

08:39.319 --> 08:42.254
Finally, parker tastes
bitter defeat.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.456
(blows whistle)

08:45.492 --> 08:47.359
Challenge!

08:47.361 --> 08:48.960
(snaps fingers)

08:50.030 --> 08:52.864
According to
wisconsin pe guidelines,

08:52.866 --> 08:54.399
Article six,
paragraph two,

08:54.401 --> 08:57.068
A flexed-arm hang
should be weighted by age.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.404
Since parker is
five years younger
than maddie,

08:59.406 --> 09:00.805
He actually beat her
by four seconds

09:00.807 --> 09:02.207
And set
a school record.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.745
I know greatness
when I see it,
young parker.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.915
You're a rising star,
and I'm hitching
my wagon.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.149
Huh,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.751
Artie's right.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.021
Parker is the winner.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.822
-Yes!
-No!

09:19.693 --> 09:21.693
Remember when I said
it would happen?

09:21.695 --> 09:23.762
It just happened.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.537
All rise

09:32.539 --> 09:35.273
For the flexed-arm hang
king of ridgewood,

09:35.275 --> 09:37.776
Parker rooney!

09:42.749 --> 09:44.749
Applaud him.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.519
Recognize his greatness.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.957
Aligning myself with artie
isn't ideal.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.794
Frittata?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.596
But it does have
its perks.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.765
(blows whistle)

10:00.767 --> 10:02.801
All right,
good class today.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.070
That does it
for the fitness portion.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.272
Tomorrow we go back
to straight-up
competition,

10:07.274 --> 10:09.975
So divide yourselves up
into teams.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.876
I choose parker
for my team.

10:11.878 --> 10:14.479

10:25.959 --> 10:28.093

victorious tomorrow?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.161
We will be playing

10:30.163 --> 10:33.098
Sock hockey.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.334
Ooh, sock hockey.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.982
Okay, okay, okay,
joey, joey, joey,
stop, stop, stop.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.587
Well, you know,
I don't really like
to brag,

10:55.589 --> 10:58.957
But no one has
ever scored on me
in sock hockey.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.527
In fact, they call me
"the great wall
of maddie."

11:02.529 --> 11:04.262
You know what?
I take it back.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.597
I do like to brag.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.666
How could I have forgotten
the great wall of maddie?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.134
We have no shot.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.002
Parker rooney,
I abandon you.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.771
Minions, retreat!

11:12.773 --> 11:14.339
Relax, artie.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.974
In middle school
they called me

11:15.976 --> 11:18.943
"the juggernaut."
nothing can stop me.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.812
Minions, hold
your retreat.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.548
This creative
yet powerful nickname
intrigues me.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.720
Students:
Ooh.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.689
I can do that
all day.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.360
I figured out
why they call him
"the juggernaut."

11:36.463 --> 11:37.862
He's a juggernaut.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.839
Well, it was not easy

11:47.841 --> 11:50.175
Getting 400 pounds
of marble up there,

11:50.177 --> 11:53.078
But the sign you made
looks amazing, andie.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.080
Thanks.
Glad we got it bolted in

11:55.082 --> 11:57.982
Before my mom realized
her kitchen counter
was missing.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.419
This sign is gonna
show ridgewood

12:01.421 --> 12:03.755
That the class of 2016
is the biggest

12:03.757 --> 12:05.590
And baddest
to ever walk these halls.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.625
Yeah, it is.
Whoo!

12:12.099 --> 12:13.131
What?

12:14.768 --> 12:17.035
Are you wearing
dump truck's jacket
right now?

12:17.037 --> 12:18.436
(gasps)

12:18.438 --> 12:20.004
What? No.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.540
Whatever.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.042
Shut up.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.376
Ooh.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.013
Andie's got a boyfriend.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.616
I said, shut up.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.587
Well, no one's gonna
miss that sign.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.222
That's what we're
going for, mom.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.957
I mean, this sign is
gonna show ridgewood

12:38.959 --> 12:42.894
That the class of 2016
is not like every other
graduating class.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.195
You know,
I have to say,

12:44.197 --> 12:47.132
I do feel more welcome
than I did yesterday.

12:47.934 --> 12:50.068
Oh, mom, would you mind
taking a picture of me

12:50.070 --> 12:52.303
And the rest
of the awesome
senior gift committee?

12:54.074 --> 12:55.807
-Liv: Okay.
-Karen: Yes.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.275
Oh, okay, so, mom,

12:57.277 --> 12:58.977
You're holding
the phone backwards.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.645
-Oh.
-Yeah, you just need
to turn it around...

13:00.647 --> 13:02.981
-Oh, turn it around.
-...And use the little
swipe up-- camera mode--

13:02.983 --> 13:04.716
-I got that turned around.
-No, so, mom--

13:04.718 --> 13:06.151
So, mom, mom, mom,
mom, mom, mom,

13:06.153 --> 13:08.319
Is it okay if joey
just takes the picture.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.588
-Oh, sure.
-I would be happy to.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.258
Joey, just make sure
you get that sign
in the picture.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.427
You think, mom?
I would have never
thought of that.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.264
All right, ladies,
let's, on three, say,

13:19.266 --> 13:21.266
"ridgewood."

13:21.268 --> 13:23.334
Ridgewood.

13:29.109 --> 13:30.775
Yeesh.
All right, liv,

13:30.777 --> 13:33.178
You blinked
and ruined the photo.
So let's do that again.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.591
Thank goodness
joey wasn't hurt.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.661
Or anyone else.

13:49.663 --> 13:51.296
Oh, right.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.464
Sorry, mrs. Rooney.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.300
I don't know what
we were thinking.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.368
Well, we just really
wanted, you know,

13:57.370 --> 13:59.037
To give a gift
that was gonna top

13:59.039 --> 14:00.672
What every other class
has ever done.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.307
Liv, the senior class
gift

14:02.309 --> 14:05.176
Isn't about trying
to outdo everybody else.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.845
It's about
what you can do

14:06.847 --> 14:08.780
To leave the school
a better place.

14:08.782 --> 14:11.015
What did your class
give, dad?

14:11.017 --> 14:12.150
That clock.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.820
But it runs
six minutes fast.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.856
And everyone gets
to class on time.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.626
That's our legacy.
You're welcome.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.230
(snickering)

14:25.232 --> 14:27.065
You guys--

14:27.067 --> 14:31.035
You guys are
the laughingstock
of the entire school.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.847
All right,
great wall,

14:42.849 --> 14:45.149
We've got a big game today
against the juggernaut.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.384
-You have to focus.
-Okay.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.952
(breathes deeply)

15:17.384 --> 15:19.284
Is that focused enough
for you?

15:19.286 --> 15:21.286
Yeah, it is!

15:21.288 --> 15:23.721
Ha-ha!
We're gonna crush parker.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.089
Yeah.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.891
Hey, guys,

15:26.893 --> 15:29.627
I just overheard parker
on the phone with reggie.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.263
You overheard,
or you were eavesdropping?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.232
Hey, if he is gonna
talk on the phone

15:34.234 --> 15:36.467
While he is using the toilet,
then he should close
the door.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.405
The point is,
he was talking about

15:40.407 --> 15:43.274
How hard it is
to fit in at a new school.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.643
Hard?
He's winning
everything.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.946
Well, that's because
he thinks he has to be
the best at everything

15:47.948 --> 15:49.881
To make up for the fact
that he doesn't have
any friends.

15:49.883 --> 15:53.251
I mean, it is hard
being the youngest kid
at the whole school.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.652
Really?

15:56.056 --> 15:57.322
Oh,

15:57.324 --> 15:59.490
I feel so bad.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.160
I had no idea
that he was struggling
so much.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.262
Well, he is.
But I appreciate

16:04.264 --> 16:06.965
That my children
are looking out
for their baby brother.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.837
Dude, can you
believe that?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.439
That's, like,
terrible.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.974
I know.

16:15.976 --> 16:18.142
We can't talk on the phone
in the bathroom anymore?

16:18.144 --> 16:19.978
What kind of a...?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.254
Bam!
What?

16:30.256 --> 16:31.289
(blows whistle)

16:31.291 --> 16:34.158
Missed again,
juggernaut.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.593
Good save, mads.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.196
There's still
plenty of time
for us to win.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.764
There's only
20 seconds left!

16:39.766 --> 16:41.199
What are you
waiting for?

16:44.371 --> 16:45.770
(blows whistle)

16:59.185 --> 17:00.852
(blows whistle)
tripping.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.287
Whoa, come on, ref,
that was clearly hooking.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.490
-Also illegal.
-Oh, okay.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.291
Well, then off to
the penalty box I go.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.294
<i>♪ do-do-do-do-do,</i>
<i>do-do-do-do-do. ♪</i>

17:10.296 --> 17:12.630
A penalty shot
for team parker.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.900
You need to score.

17:15.902 --> 17:20.071
Are you a juggernaut
or a jugger-not?

17:25.045 --> 17:26.878
I did not know
what to do,

17:26.880 --> 17:28.679
Because, I mean,
on one hand,

17:28.681 --> 17:30.848
You know,
my little brother
was hurting

17:30.850 --> 17:33.084
And he needed
a confidence boost.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.219
But on the other hand,

17:35.221 --> 17:37.321
You know,
I'm the great wall
of maddie.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.592
The great wall
had to make a great
decision.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.165
(blows whistle)

17:57.410 --> 18:00.244
(students cheering)

18:00.246 --> 18:02.046
No!

18:02.048 --> 18:03.614
What?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.616
Don't judge me.

18:05.618 --> 18:06.984
He's my little
brother.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.721
Yes!

18:10.723 --> 18:13.925
Finally, my first
winning team!

18:13.927 --> 18:16.294
Minions, we sock dance!

18:16.296 --> 18:18.763
<i>(upbeat music playing)</i>

18:36.749 --> 18:39.617
Hey, good game,
little bro.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.053
Thanks, sis.

18:42.055 --> 18:44.122
I scored a goal
against maddie.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.990
And she's amazing.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.926
(emotionally)
I'm gonna be okay
in high school.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.294
(clears throat)

18:50.296 --> 18:51.963
(normal voice)
I mean, of course I won.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.464
I'm a high school
student.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.574
Hey.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.009
What do you want,
munch?

19:05.011 --> 19:06.144
I don't know.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.913
Congrats on the goal.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.581
Wanna go sock dance?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.051
-I'd love to.
-Yeah, you do.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.824
It's a good thing
you'd never throw
a game

19:19.826 --> 19:22.093
To give your
little brother
some hallway cred

19:22.095 --> 19:24.295
And confidence.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.464
No. Exactly.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.266
'cause you know me
better than that.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.535
Yeah.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.569
I do.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.178
Hey, joey,
want to have a contest

19:40.180 --> 19:42.480
To see who can pinch
the lightest?

19:42.482 --> 19:45.383
Okay, I am not falling
for that again.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.451
You go first
this time.

19:49.689 --> 19:50.922
Ow!

19:52.859 --> 19:55.860
(blows air horn)

19:55.862 --> 19:58.296
Family meeting!

19:58.298 --> 20:00.798
Come on, mom,
it was about to be
my turn to pinch joey.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.503
We have some
wonderful news.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.373
I swear, if you say
that parker's getting
his driver's license,

20:09.375 --> 20:11.242
I'm gonna flip
this table right now!

20:12.212 --> 20:14.145
(grunting)

20:16.983 --> 20:19.483
Okay, so the table's
super heavy,

20:19.485 --> 20:20.751
But I'm still
very upset.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.053
Okay.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.256
This is about
your father.

20:25.258 --> 20:28.192
Okay, so you know
how it's always been
my dream

20:28.194 --> 20:31.028
To coach college
basketball, right?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.397
I've been given
an opportunity
to do that.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.533
Dad, that's amazing!

20:35.535 --> 20:38.669
It's in beloit, wisconsin,
a couple hours away.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.371
We're moving?

20:40.373 --> 20:42.506
No, no, honey, no.
We don't want to uproot
everyone.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.076
So taking this job
would mean that I wouldn't
be living at home...

20:46.446 --> 20:48.546
Except for offseason
and weekends.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.348
Now we were very torn
as to whether this was

20:50.350 --> 20:52.116
The right thing
for our family.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.918
But seeing how well
you kids dealt

20:53.920 --> 20:55.720
With parker moving up
to high school,

20:55.722 --> 20:58.289
We realized this family
could handle anything.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.592
We just want you guys
to be part of the decision.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.527
So?

21:03.529 --> 21:05.463
What do you think?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.900
Well, I mean,

21:09.902 --> 21:11.736
You know, dad,
you've always supported us

21:11.738 --> 21:13.437
In pursuing
our dreams,

21:13.439 --> 21:16.941
Like, you know,
when I wanted to go away
to hollywood.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.577
Yeah, or, you know,
when I dreamed of being
the state champ.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.546
And when I dreamed
of building my
first robot.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.582
When I wanted to learn
to eat corn on the cob

21:24.584 --> 21:26.484
Without squirting myself
in the eye.

21:28.254 --> 21:30.955
Now it's time
that we support you
in pursuing your dream.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.391
Yeah, dad,
you have to do this.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.461
Well then,

21:37.463 --> 21:41.399
Your dad is a college
basketball coach!

21:41.401 --> 21:42.600
Yeah!

21:42.602 --> 21:44.335
I'm so proud
of you.

21:46.472 --> 21:48.139
I'm so proud of you.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.343
Going to a new school
can be tough, kid.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.312
But don't worry,
you'll be okay.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.953
Hey, ridgewood!

22:02.955 --> 22:06.257
Behold your gift
from the class of 2016!

22:07.260 --> 22:08.526
(gasps)

22:08.528 --> 22:10.661
All:
Ooh.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.465
The sip-o-matic
water station

22:14.467 --> 22:16.667
Will serve ridgewood
for generations.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.870
Activate the fountain
with front or
side pushbars

22:19.872 --> 22:21.505
For clean,
filtered water

22:21.507 --> 22:23.341
With minimal splash.

22:25.378 --> 22:28.512
Or fill your
environmentally-friendly
water bottle

22:28.514 --> 22:30.514
With the sensor-activated

22:30.516 --> 22:32.216
Quick fill.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.385
All:
Ooh.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.654
And joseph gilligan rooney

22:36.656 --> 22:38.889
Will be the first student
from his class

22:38.891 --> 22:40.725
To take a sip.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.066
And that was a gift

22:49.068 --> 22:51.235
From the class of 2019.

22:51.237 --> 22:52.770
You're welcome.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.675
Don't worry, little man.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.310
I will hug you dry.

22:59.312 --> 23:00.711
Please, no.
Please, no.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.714
Joey: <i> It's happening.</i>
