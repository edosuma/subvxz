Goodness, Chad. Don't be sensitive.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.530
Hey, that wasn't worth all that fuss,
was it, Alex, hmm?

01:54.697 --> 01:56.365
[Woman] Come on now.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.242
- Is he OK?
- He'll be fine.

01:58.409 --> 02:04.331
Well, Paul. Six years, three banks
and $200 million later.

Mr. Wagner, it's time

- Good luck, darling.

02:23.560 --> 02:29.481
Many centuries ago,
a Chinese poet foresaw a Hong Kong

02:29.649 --> 02:33.318
that glittered like the stars
in the heavens.

02:33.486 --> 02:37.156
Today, by providing an underwater tunnel

02:37.323 --> 02:41.827
to connect Hong Kong Island with
the mainland and the New Territories,

02:41.995 --> 02:46.748
we hope that
we have brought that prophecy

02:46.916 --> 02:49.918
one step closer to reality.

to follow you home?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.832
Oh, I can get home without you, Frank.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.628
- I'll believe that when I see it.
- [Paul] We'll be fine.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.380
You take the night off. Hey, thanks.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.050
Without you I could never have done it.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.468
Now, get lost, you bum.

03:40.511 --> 03:45.807
If you say so. Katherine, take a look
under the front seat, would you?

03:45.975 --> 03:47.976
That's a little token
of my appreciation.

03:48.144 --> 03:51.897
I don't know how Paul's initials
got on there, but they're there.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.817
That's nice, Frank. It's really nice.
It's cheap and there's no cigars, but...

03:55.985 --> 03:57.152
[laughs]

03:57.320 --> 04:00.614

- Yeah.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.544
It's simple.
The Victoria Harbour Tunnel

18:49.711 --> 18:54.298
was built by a man I used to work for
after my tour of Nam.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.052
Halfway through construction
he ran into money problems.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.429
So they pulled in Griffith
as an equity partner.

19:00.597 --> 19:06.519
Griffith got his cash from a secret loan

19:06.687 --> 19:08.729
courtesy of the Zhang family.

19:09.731 --> 19:14.527
When the tunnel was completed, and
my employer's construction expertise

19:14.695 --> 19:16.154
was no longer needed,

19:16.321 --> 19:21.450
they had him and his wife
exxed out by a Triad hit team.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.953
Only, the Triads fucked up

19:24.163 --> 19:28.416
because they had two sons, babies,
who they were gonna wipe out, too,

19:28.584 --> 19:31.752
so they wouldn't come back
and claim what was rightfully theirs.

This is the cognac Mr. Zhang asked for.

52:54.087 --> 52:57.548
Can you give this to him, please?

52:57.716 --> 52:59.717
With my compliments.

53:01.678 --> 53:05.973
Now, turning to a more immediate matter.

53:08.101 --> 53:11.353
Last night, our factory was destroyed.

53:11.521 --> 53:15.858
I know you're all aware
of this temporary setback.

53:16.026 --> 53:21.655
Since the police are not claiming
responsibility, one can only assume

53:21.823 --> 53:25.576
that it was the work
of an outside rival.

53:28.205 --> 53:32.208
Or worse yet... an inside rival.

53:32.375 --> 53:34.960
[Dance music continues]

53:52.854 --> 53:57.191
Yes, I know. It's terribly bad
for the morale of all concerned

53:57.400 --> 53:59.693
when someone isn't being a team player.

54:01.488 --> 54:06.492
You see, we've been letting
ourselves get soft, gentlemen.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.744
Lax in our attitudes.

54:08.912 --> 54:11.830
We haven't been paying
sufficient attention

54:11.998 --> 54:14.500
to all the little details.

54:15.543 --> 54:20.339
Have we, now... Mr. Ngyuen?

- This is the cognac for Mr. Zhang.

55:25.238 --> 55:29.116
Just arrived from Marseilles.
Number one. [chuckles]

55:31.578 --> 55:34.997
- Would you like to dance?
- Yeah, why not?

55:36.166 --> 55:38.876
You are very handsome man.
Like Sean Connery.

55:39.044 --> 55:41.295
Uh-huh. What?

55:46.259 --> 55:48.927
- What's that?
- French cognac, sir.

55:49.095 --> 55:52.056
From our friend Alex.

55:53.933 --> 55:56.602
He knew about last night's shipment.

55:57.354 --> 56:01.440
Invite him in here.
We'd like to have a drink with him.

56:07.530 --> 56:11.116
- Would you like to dance with me?
- Uh...

56:20.085 --> 56:23.462
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- OK.

56:27.133 --> 56:28.634
More cognac, eh?

56:30.261 --> 56:33.806
Well, guess what? The big boss
would like to thank you personally.

56:34.682 --> 56:38.644
- Hey, that's nice.
- In there.

56:40.480 --> 56:45.317
Um, I've got one more case in the car.
I'll be right back.

56:45.485 --> 56:47.653
No. You don't seem to understand.

56:47.821 --> 56:49.530
Mr. Zhang would like to thank you now.

- No.
- No?

[Kara] That's good, because...
I have to frisk you.

59:25.979 --> 59:28.814
And if I don't find anything, well...

59:31.150 --> 59:33.819
I can let you go.

59:40.493 --> 59:43.370

this ever happened.

that the mysterious fires plaguing
properties owned by Transworld Exports

are the result of renewed warfare
between rival Triad families

An old document.

"searched"? Who searched you?
