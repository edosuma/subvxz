- YOU STILL WANNA HAVE MY BABY,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

00:02.930 --> 00:03.715
- PEOPLE PAY A LOT OF MONEY
FOR A BABY TH ESE DAYS.

00:03.860 --> 00:05.589
- I CAN'T GIVE YOU MONEY
FOR THE BABY, ZOE.

00:05.720 --> 00:06.994
- I NEED HELP.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.892
- I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE WORKING VERY HARD,

00:09.040 --> 00:11.031
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

00:11.180 --> 00:12.454
- SHE KISSED ME,
I TOLD YOU ABOUT IT.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.729
YOU ASKED ME TO FIRE HER,
I TRIED TO FIRE HER,

00:14.870 --> 00:16.007
I COULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT,

00:16.150 --> 00:17.549
I FELT LIKE HER FEELINGS
WERE HURT.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.281
HEY, CAN WE TALK?
- I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO WORK.

00:19.430 --> 00:20.943
- I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM,

00:21.090 --> 00:22.216
BUT I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.975
I REALLY LIKE JASMINE
AND JABBAR.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.748
THIS IS FOR REAL.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.950
[sighs]

00:35.100 --> 00:35.885
[Cults' Rave Onplays]

00:46.800 --> 00:50.759
- ON A BOAT,
ON MY SAILING SHIP

00:50.910 --> 00:54.380
ON MY OWN,
FAR AWAY FROM IT

00:54.530 --> 00:55.394
- OH.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.872
[groans]

00:57.020 --> 00:59.181

00:59.330 --> 01:03.266
I'LL PASS

01:03.400 --> 01:06.267

- YOU GOTTA GO.
- OH, BOY, THIS HAPPENED.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.682
- MY MOTHER IS DROPPING JABBAR
OFF AT 7:30.

01:14.830 --> 01:17.060
THAT MEANS YOU GOT SEVEN MINUTES
TO GET UP AND GET OUT OF BED.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.552
COME ON.

01:18.690 --> 01:20.032
SHE'S NEVER BEEN LATE
FOR ANYTHING IN HER LIFE.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.727
- YOU WAN NA TALK ABOUT--

01:21.870 --> 01:22.859
WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
RIGHT NOW.

01:23.010 --> 01:23.999
WE GOT NO TIME.
GET UP.

01:24.150 --> 01:24.900

I'M GOING.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.312

OH, MAN.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.904
- DO YOU--ARE YOU--
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:28.050 --> 01:28.948
- NO, EVERYTHING
IS NOT OKAY!

01:29.080 --> 01:30.809
- OKAY, I'M COMING.
HOLD ON.

01:30.950 --> 01:31.939
OH, BOY.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.227

- OKAY, OKAY.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.679

I'M COMING, COMING, COMING.

01:34.810 --> 01:38.814
ALL RIGHT, UM--

01:38.960 --> 01:40.188

GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

01:40.340 --> 01:43.093

01:44.860 --> 01:46.304
WE'LL TALK LATER.

01:46.450 --> 01:49.897
- RAVE ON

01:50.040 --> 01:54.898
RAVE ON

02:00.360 --> 02:01.907
- HEY.
- HMM.

02:02.050 --> 02:04.018
- I WAS JUST COMING OVER HERE
TO SEE IF YOU NEEDED ANYTHING,

02:04.150 --> 02:05.492
BUT YOU'RE ALL SET.

02:05.640 --> 02:06.777
SO PEET'S.
- YUP.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.013
- THEY'RE GOOD.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.559
- I THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE EASIER

02:09.710 --> 02:12.634
IF WE GAVE EACH OTHER
SOME SPACE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

02:12.780 --> 02:16.022
- YEAH,
I...I GET THAT.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.740
- GREAT.

02:17.890 --> 02:20.950
- I MEAN, I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
IF--IF YOU AND JOEL

02:21.100 --> 02:22.544
NEED TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT.

02:22.690 --> 02:25.579
I GET IT, SO I UNDERSTAND.
NO PROBLEM.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.448
- ZOE...

02:27.590 --> 02:30.718
THERE'S NOTHING FOR US
TO THINK ABOUT.

02:30.870 --> 02:34.556
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:34.700 --> 02:37.077
WE DON'T NEED TIME
TO THINK ABOUT IT,

02:37.220 --> 02:40.701
WE NEED TIME TO GET OVER IT.

02:40.850 --> 02:43.045
WOULD YOU JUST SHUT
THE DOOR BEHIND YOU?

02:43.190 --> 02:46.057
- OH.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.748
OKAY.
- OKAY.

03:09.670 --> 03:12.457
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
JASMINE AND DR. PRESTIDGE?

03:12.600 --> 03:13.828
- WE'LL--WE'LL GET TO THAT,

03:13.980 --> 03:16.289
BUT WHAT'S WITH
THE FROSTINESS GOING ON

03:16.430 --> 03:18.534
WITH YOU AND THE OLD LADY?

03:18.680 --> 03:19.874
UH-OH.
- HEY.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.430
- HI.
- HEY, LADIES.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.571
- WHO'S MORE APPEALING
THAN THIS?

03:23.720 --> 03:25.335
NO ONE.
- NOBODY.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.435
- YOU'RE GIVING
THE WRONG MESSAGE.

03:26.580 --> 03:28.161
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.029
I'M JUST--
[groans]

03:31.170 --> 03:33.138
- AMBER NEEDS A JOB.
SHE NEEDS SOME WORK.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.794
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANYTHING
AT THE STUDIO THAT SHE COULD DO?

03:35.930 --> 03:37.898
- WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN NICE.
- SHE'S NEEDING SOME MONEY.

03:38.040 --> 03:39.314
- I LOVE MUSIC.
- SHE'S SO VERY MUSICAL.

03:39.460 --> 03:40.939
- CAN YOU BLAME ME?

03:41.080 --> 03:42.763
- YEAH, WE ALREADY HAVE
AN ASSISTANT.

03:42.910 --> 03:45.219
- I MEAN, WE WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE YOU BUT--

03:45.360 --> 03:47.760
- YOUR DAD WANTS
TO GIVE A SPEECH HERE.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.218
- OKAY.
BE RIGHT THERE, POP.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.112
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:51.260 --> 03:54.468
- AMBER'S LOOKING FOR WORK,
BUT WE--YOU KNOW--

03:54.610 --> 03:55.816
- IF YOU HAD AN ASSISTANT?

03:55.950 --> 03:57.645
YEAH, YOU GUYS HAVE
A GREAT ASSISTANT.

03:57.780 --> 03:59.509
ACTUALLY, I'M WORKING
ON A CAMPAIGN.

03:59.650 --> 04:01.811
AND MAYBE
I CAN GET YOU ONBOARD.

04:01.960 --> 04:04.133
I DON'T KNOW IF
THERE'S ANY OPENINGS.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.238
BOBBY LITTLE--
HE'S RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.404
- THIS GUY--HE USED
TO BE HER INTERN.

04:07.550 --> 04:08.653
WE CALLED HIM
"LI'I'I'LE BOBBY LITTLE."

04:08.800 --> 04:09.789
- YOU CALLED HIM
"LI'ITLE BOBBY LITTLE."

04:09.930 --> 04:11.511
- OH, WOW.

04:11.660 --> 04:14.037
GREAT AT THAT.
- [whistles] COME HERE. COME.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.556
COME ON!
- WE'RE READY...

04:15.700 --> 04:18.043
- YEAH. I JUST WANT
TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.875
NOTHING, NO BIG DEAL.
- I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.739
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
'CAUSE I CAN'T HIRE HER,

04:21.880 --> 04:23.279
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HIRE HER?
- NO, YOU HAVE AN ASSISTANT.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.807
IF YOU WOULD HAVE FIRED RACHEL,
YOU'D HAVE A SPOT OPEN.

04:25.950 --> 04:27.747
BUT YOU DIDN'T,
SO I'M GOING TO TRY.

04:27.880 --> 04:29.529

ABOUT A STORM?

04:47.660 --> 04:50.003
- NOPE.
LOOKS LIKE CLEAR SKIES AHEAD.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.071
- OH, MY GOD.

04:51.220 --> 04:54.735
[laughter]

04:54.880 --> 04:56.006

TO SCHOOL IN THE MORNING.

05:18.830 --> 05:20.684
I HAVE TO STOP
BY THE OFFICE.

05:20.830 --> 05:22.934
- OKAY.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.038
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
START WORK UNTIL MONDAY.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.809
- I DON'T, BUT BOB
WANTS ME TO MEET THE TEAM, SO...

05:29.950 --> 05:33.420
- ALL RIGHT.

05:33.570 --> 05:36.038
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO BE MAD AT ME?

05:43.130 --> 05:44.358
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.638
- HMM.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.108
[sighs]

05:53.800 --> 05:56.109
MAY GOD BLESS

AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:03.840 --> 06:06.217

06:06.360 --> 06:08.464
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:08.600 --> 06:10.909
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:11.060 --> 06:13.290
FOREVER YOUNG

06:13.440 --> 06:15.988
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:16.130 --> 06:18.098
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:18.230 --> 06:20.812
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:20.960 --> 06:22.951
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:23.100 --> 06:25.785
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:25.930 --> 06:28.069
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:28.210 --> 06:30.030
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:30.180 --> 06:32.557

06:35.110 --> 06:38.113
FOREVER YOUNG

06:41.120 --> 06:44.988
- HEY, WE WOULD TOTALLY HIRE
AMBER IF WE HAD THE MONEY.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.530
I WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE HER WORKING HERE.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.193
I THINK IT'D BE REALLY FUN.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.672
- DON'T YOU THINK
IT'D BE SO GREAT

06:49.820 --> 06:51.264
WITH HER MUSIC AND EVERYTHING?
- NO, IT WOULD.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.743
BUT SHE NEEDS MONEY, AND WE'RE
NOT IN A POSITION TO PAY HER.

06:54.890 --> 06:55.640
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE

06:55.790 --> 06:58.896
ON A CAMPAIGN, BUT--

06:59.030 --> 07:00.065
- WELL, MAYBE IT WILL LEAD
TO SOMETHING.

07:00.210 --> 07:01.893
- YEAH.
-I THINK IT WAS COOL, THOUGH,

07:02.040 --> 07:04.759
OF KRISTINA TO OFFER, RIGHT?
- I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL TOO.

07:04.900 --> 07:08.597
- SO SPEAKING OF AMBER, UH,
TRYING TO GET A JOB,

07:08.730 --> 07:11.494
I SLEPT WITH JASMINE
THE OTHER DAY.

07:11.630 --> 07:14.190
- [coughs]

07:14.330 --> 07:15.945
- OOPS.

07:16.090 --> 07:18.467
I WAS HOPING THAT MAYBE YOU'VE
DONE THE SAME THING WITH SETH

07:18.610 --> 07:22.398
AND COULD ADVISE ME
ON SAID SITUATION.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.325
HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED?

07:23.470 --> 07:24.505
- MM.

07:24.650 --> 07:26.094
- THAT'S A YES?

07:26.230 --> 07:27.982
[chuckles] GOOD, SO THIS IS
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS.

07:28.130 --> 07:29.472
PE-PEOPLE DO THIS.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.544
- IT'S THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD,
YOU KNOW.

07:32.690 --> 07:34.442
IT'S A PRETTY SPECIAL
CONNECTION.

07:34.590 --> 07:35.682
- YEAH...

07:35.830 --> 07:37.513
YEAH, IT'S COMPLICATED.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.345
YOU KNOW, WE WERE TELLING JABBAR
THAT WE WEREN'T GETTING MARRIED,

07:40.490 --> 07:43.141
AND IT WAS KIND OF SAD.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.518
WE WERE--WE WERE BOTH SAD.

07:44.670 --> 07:47.116
AND THEN WE STARTED
DRINKING WINE, AND--

07:47.250 --> 07:48.569
AND THEN...
[laughs]

07:48.700 --> 07:50.144
YOU KNOW.
- I KNOW.

07:50.290 --> 07:51.734
- I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.324
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO SAY TO HER.

07:53.470 --> 07:55.392
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING
TO MAKE EVERYTHING DIFFERENT?

07:55.540 --> 07:58.646
- IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT

07:58.780 --> 08:02.955
YOU WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE DIFFERENT.

08:03.100 --> 08:06.820
- MM-HMM.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.689
WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW?

08:16.150 --> 08:19.597
- SO YOU DID THE EMBARCADERO
YESTERDAY?

08:19.740 --> 08:20.809
AND YOU WERE ON TODAY?

08:20.940 --> 08:21.929
CAN YOU CALL
REPRESENTATIVE PORTER

08:22.080 --> 08:24.492
TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE'S ON BOARD?

08:24.640 --> 08:25.971
TERRIFIC. ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
AH...

08:26.120 --> 08:27.496
KRISTI NA!

08:27.640 --> 08:29.915

08:30.060 --> 08:31.573
HEY.

08:31.710 --> 08:32.745

08:32.890 --> 08:34.118
- READY TO HIT THE GROUND
RUNNING?

08:34.270 --> 08:35.532
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
WOW, YOU LOOK GREAT.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.715
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

08:36.860 --> 08:38.259
- GROWN UP.

08:38.410 --> 08:39.752

KRISTINA MY CALENDAR,

08:39.890 --> 08:41.027
GET HER SET UP WITH EVERYTHING
THAT SHE NEEDS,

08:41.170 --> 08:43.343
AND GET HER DIRECTIONS TO
THE S.E.I.U. MEETING TOMORROW?

08:43.480 --> 08:44.378
- ANYTHING YOU NEED.
- OH.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.919
- I'M KRISTINA.

08:46.070 --> 08:47.139
THE MEETING'S HERE,
AND THE NOTES FOR THE MEETING

08:47.280 --> 08:48.622
ARE ON YOUR DESK.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.079
- WELL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED
DIRECTIONS FOR THE MEETING.

08:50.210 --> 08:51.552
- THERE'S A MEETING HERE
TOMORROW?

08:51.700 --> 08:53.144
- YES, OH, CRAP.
DID YOU NOT GET A CALL?

08:53.290 --> 08:55.144
- I DIDN'T GET A CALL.
- I'M SORRY, IS THIS A PROBLEM?

08:55.290 --> 08:58.009
- I'M ACTUALLY TAKING MY SON
TO THE DINOSAUR EXHIBIT.

08:58.150 --> 08:59.902
TOMORROW'S SATURDAY,
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD BE OFF.

09:00.050 --> 09:01.256
- I AM SO SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.118
- DONNA, WILL YOU PLEASE
GO YELL AT SOMEBODY?

09:03.260 --> 09:05.535
- YES, I'M SO SORRY, WE'RE STILL
TRYING TO WORK OUT THE KINKS.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.261
- HEADS ARE GOING
TO ROLL FOR THIS.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.674
- DON'T MAKE ANY HEADS ROLL.

09:08.820 --> 09:10.219
- I PROMISE YOU.
- IT'S FINE.

09:10.370 --> 09:11.928
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU CAN MAKE
THIS MEETING TOMORROW.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.119
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT
AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE S.E.I.U.

09:14.270 --> 09:15.919
WOULD MEAN TO US.
- I KNOW. I WILL BE HERE.

09:16.070 --> 09:18.277
- I NEED YOU ON THIS.
- I'M HERE, I'M HERE FOR YOU.

09:18.410 --> 09:19.513
OKAY?
- OKAY, GOOD.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.820
- COME ON.
- WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS.

09:20.970 --> 09:22.414
- COME ON, DONNA.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.073
- DONNA, GET HER THE INFO.
KRISTINA, LET'S GO.

09:24.210 --> 09:25.450
- YES.

09:25.590 --> 09:28.479
- TH ERE'S--OKAY.
WINNER, I'M--I'M COMING.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.188
[knocking on door]

09:30.320 --> 09:32.663
- HI.
- HEY.

09:32.810 --> 09:34.732
- I THINK I NEED TO QUIT.
- WHY IS THAT?

09:34.880 --> 09:36.734
HAVE YOU BRO||(\IEC|)\I SOMETHING?

09:36.880 --> 09:38.290
I REALLY HOPED THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD BLOW OVER,

09:38.430 --> 09:39.499
BUT IT'S NOT.
AT ALL.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.221
I FEEL LIKE
I JUST RUINED EVERYTHING

09:41.370 --> 09:44.407
OVER ONE DRUNK MISTAKE.

09:44.540 --> 09:47.543
- SO YOU WANT TO THROW IT
ALL AWAY OVER ONE DRUNK MISTAKE.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.305
- YEAH.

09:49.450 --> 09:51.338
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
OTHER CHOICE I HAVE.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.892
- I THINK LIFE MIGHT GO ON.
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.826
- REALLY?
- YES, REALLY.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.130
IT'S GOING TO BLOW OVER.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.440
YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE IT
A LITTLE TIME.

09:58.590 --> 10:01.070
BETWEEN, YOU AND ME,
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT ADAM.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.620
IT'S STUFF HE'S DEALING
WITH AT HOME WITH HIS WIFE.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.079
- HIS WIFE KNOWS?
- YES, HIS WIFE KNOWS.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.494
- OH, MY GOD.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.868
- DESPITE MY ADVICE
NOT TO TELL HER.

10:09.020 --> 10:12.183
- SHE MUST HATE ME.
- YEAH, SHE PROBABLY DOES.

10:12.330 --> 10:13.911
BUT, HEY, SHE HATED ME
TWO MONTHS AGO.

10:14.060 --> 10:16.051
I MEAN, SHE REALLY
WANTED TO KILL ME.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.259
AND NOW
SHE SEEMS TO LIKE ME.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.786
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.956
- HOW'D YOU GET HER
TO FORGIVE YOU?

10:22.100 --> 10:23.715
- I DELIVERED HER BABY.
- OH.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.373
- THAT MIGHT NOT
BE AN OPTION FOR YOU,

10:25.520 --> 10:29.752
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE TO THINK
OF SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

10:29.900 --> 10:34.416
- [sighs]
I FEEL SO STUPID.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.040
- HEY, IT'S OKAY.

10:37.180 --> 10:39.068
YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL STUPID.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.871
YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON.
YOU SCREWED UP.

10:42.020 --> 10:43.874
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
YOU'RE HUMAN.

10:44.020 --> 10:46.636
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
- OKAY.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.465
THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:49.610 --> 10:51.714
NOW GO WORK.
YEAH?

10:51.850 --> 10:54.603

OKAY. [laughs]

10:54.750 --> 10:57.878
- CHOP CHOP?

11:12.910 --> 11:15.526
- HEY.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.877
- HOW'S IT GOING?

11:18.020 --> 11:19.419
WORKING HARD?
- OH, YEAH.

11:19.570 --> 11:22.050
IT'S FREEZING OUT THERE.
- YEAH, IT'S CRAZY, I KNOW.

11:22.190 --> 11:23.430
- WHAT'S FOR SPECIAL TODAY?

11:23.570 --> 11:25.128
- OHH, WE HAVE, UH...

11:25.270 --> 11:26.191
- I'M FIGHTING
A LITTLE BIT OF A COLD.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.160
- SOME LOVELY COFFEE
OR LOVELY TEA.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.928
YEAH, THOSE ARE SORT OF--
THOSE ARE OUR SPECIALTIES HERE.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.402
- ALL RIGHT.

11:32.550 --> 11:34.927
- VERY GOOD, VERY GREAT.
EVERYTHING'S AWESOME.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.107
- DID YOU COME HERE TO BREAK
THE NEWS GENTLY TO ME?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.242
NO JOB, STUCK HERE FOREVER?

11:40.380 --> 11:41.790
- ACTUALLY, IT'S
THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

11:41.940 --> 11:44.340
UH, I'M COMING TO TELL YOU THAT
THERE IS ONE JOB AVAILABLE.

11:44.490 --> 11:45.832
- I'LL TAKE IT.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.174
- [laughs] REALLY?
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

11:47.320 --> 11:48.969
- I DON'T CARE
I JUST GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.428
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO BE MY ASSISTANT?

11:50.570 --> 11:52.709
THEY GAVE ME A BUDGET
FOR AN ASSISTANT,

11:52.850 --> 11:54.044
AND I IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT OF YOU.

11:54.190 --> 11:56.010
I WANT YOU TO WORK WITH ME.
- OH, MY GOSH, WOW.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.321
- IT'S A LOT OF WORK, AMBER.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

11:58.470 --> 11:59.949
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO BE UP
WITH ME IN THE MORNINGS,

12:00.090 --> 12:01.125
VERY EARLY SOMETIMES.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.407
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO SLEEP A LOT,

12:02.540 --> 12:04.053
YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING
ERRANDS NONSTOP.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.474
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE SITTING IN ON MEETINGS,

12:05.620 --> 12:07.099
WRITING COPY FOR THE PRESS.
- OH, MY GOSH.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.514
- I KNOW, IT SOUNDS INTENSE
BECAUSE IT IS.

12:08.650 --> 12:10.754
BUT I JUST THINK THAT
THIS COULD BE SO GREAT FOR YOU.

12:10.900 --> 12:11.969
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.
- WOW.

12:12.110 --> 12:15.170

12:15.320 --> 12:18.278

12:18.420 --> 12:20.456

12:20.600 --> 12:23.046
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST,

12:23.190 --> 12:25.909
I--I DON'T HAVE
THE BEST TRACK RECORD

12:26.050 --> 12:27.529
WHEN IT COMES
TO FAMILY BUSINESS,

12:27.670 --> 12:29.319
AND I DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU DOWN.

12:29.470 --> 12:31.119
- AMBER, STOP, STOP, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO LET ME DOWN, OKAY?

12:31.260 --> 12:33.501
I THINK THAT YOU'RE SMART,
I THINK THAT YOU'RE RESOURCEFUL,

12:33.640 --> 12:35.437
I THINK THAT YOU HAVE
THIS AMAZING ABILITY

12:35.580 --> 12:36.717
TO TALK TO ANYBODY.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.090
YOU'RE LIKE A DIAMOND
IN THE ROUGH.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.925
I THINK YOU NEED TO GIVE
YOURSELF MORE CREDIT.

12:41.070 --> 12:43.447
HONEY, THE WAY
THAT YOU WERE WITH MAX--

12:43.590 --> 12:44.818
I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT.

12:44.970 --> 12:46.995
SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

12:47.140 --> 12:48.175

13:08.710 --> 13:10.086
MAX, HONEY,

13:10.230 --> 13:11.333
I AM SO BUMMED THAT
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE

13:11.480 --> 13:12.981
THE DINOSAURS TOMORROW
WITH YOU.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.301
AND I'M SO SORRY--

13:14.440 --> 13:15.190
- WELL, THERE ARE
NO ACTUAL DINOSAURS.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.989
THEY'RE EXTINCT.
- RIGHT, I KNOW.

13:17.140 --> 13:18.710
- THEY JUST HAVE THE BONES.
- THAT'S VERY TRUE.

13:18.860 --> 13:19.963
VERY TRUE.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.203
ARE YOU UPSET
THAT I'M NOT GOING?

13:21.350 --> 13:22.510
- WELL, NO,
'CAUSE DAD CAN TAKE ME.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.128
I'M SUPER EXCITED TO SEE
THE TYRANNOSAURUS.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.838
- I'M SO EXCITED FOR YOU.
I HEARD IT'S AMAZING.

13:26.970 --> 13:27.868
- YEAH, IT'S GOING TO BE COOL.
DAD!

13:28.010 --> 13:29.557
- YEAH?
H EY.

13:29.700 --> 13:32.043
- OKAY, SO THE MUSEUM
SAYS TO EXPECT CROWDS

13:32.190 --> 13:34.146
AND, YOU KNOW,
DELAYS IN LINES,

13:34.290 --> 13:35.450
SO WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS
WE SHOULD GET THERE EARLY.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.079
PROBABLY BEFORE IT OPENS--

13:37.230 --> 13:38.800
- I GOT CHINESE FOOD BECAUSE
I WAS AT THE OFFICE LATE.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.838
- JUST GIVE ME
ONE SECOND, MAX.

13:40.990 --> 13:42.469
THAT'S OKAY. I LOVE CHINESE.
THANK YOU.

13:42.610 --> 13:43.577
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- I CAN TAKE ALL THAT OUT.

13:43.710 --> 13:45.291
- I GOT IT.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.532
- MAX, JUST LET ME TALK
TO YOUR MOM FOR ONE SECOND.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.307
HONEY, I HAVE TO GO IN
TO WORK TOMORROW.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.953
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO CHECK OUT THE STUDIO.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.260
THEY CAN ONLY
COME IN TOMORROW.

13:51.410 --> 13:52.889
- NO, NO,
YOU'RE NOT WORKING TOMORROW.

13:53.030 --> 13:55.134
NO, YOU CAN'T WORK TOMORROW
BECAUSE TOMORROW IS SATURDAY.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.349
- AND I KNOW THAT I SAID
I WAS GOING TO GO,

13:56.490 --> 13:57.582
BUT I CAN'T--

13:57.730 --> 13:58.685
- NO, DAD, WE'RE GOING
TO THE MUSEUM TOMORROW!

13:58.830 --> 14:00.582
- OKAY, MAX.
LISTEN TO MOM.

14:00.730 --> 14:03.073
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN
AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

14:03.220 --> 14:04.733
- I--NO! WE'RE--
- MAX...

14:04.870 --> 14:05.598
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- [breathing deeply] WE CAN'T--

14:05.740 --> 14:07.048
WE'RE GOING TO GO TOMORROW!

14:07.190 --> 14:08.737
- PLANS CHANGE,
AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.019
AND WE'LL WORK THROUGH--
- WE HAVE TO GO!

14:11.160 --> 14:12.252
- I WANTED TO GO TOO.
WHY IS HE SO UPSET?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.424
HE NEVER CARES
WHETHER I GO OR NOT.

14:13.570 --> 14:14.980
- IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,
ADAM, OKAY?

14:15.130 --> 14:16.290
- I HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW,
THEREFORE,

14:16.440 --> 14:17.600
NO ONE CAN TAKE HIM
TO THE MUSEUM.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.126
- SINCE WHEN?
- THAT IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

14:19.270 --> 14:20.669
- SINCE--
- THIS IS NEWS TO ME.

14:20.820 --> 14:21.889
- I HAVE A MEETING TOMORROW.
IT WAS JUST CALLED.

14:22.030 --> 14:23.167
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.572
- WELL, A HEADS-UP
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.029
- WHAT, SHOULD I HAVE CALLED
YOUR SECRETARY?

14:27.170 --> 14:28.899
- VERY FUNNY.
- SHOULD HAVE GIVEN HER A RING.

14:29.040 --> 14:30.166
- I WOULD HAVE JUST APPRECIATED
A HEADS-UP, THAT'S ALL.

14:30.310 --> 14:31.481
- OH, OKAY.
NEXT TIME I WILL CALL HER.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.690
UM, DON'T WORRY, I GOT THIS.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

14:33.830 --> 14:34.865
- OKAY.
- YUP, GOT IT.

14:35.010 --> 14:37.934
- ALL RIGHT.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.186
[sighs]

14:47.850 --> 14:48.635
- MM-MM.
- HADDIE, COME ON.

14:48.780 --> 14:50.361
- I'M SORRY.

14:50.510 --> 14:51.158
- HADDIE, WE WOULDN'T BE ASKING
IF WE WEREN'T DESPERATE.

14:51.300 --> 14:53.052
- I UNDERSTAND.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.644
I'VE DONE IT SO MANY TIMES,
BUT I CAN'T.

14:54.790 --> 14:55.859
- I'VE GONE THROUGH
ALL THE BRAVERMANS,

14:55.990 --> 14:57.093
YOUR GRANDMOTHER--EVERYBODY.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.616
AND YOU'RE THE BEST
AT BABYSITTING MAX.

14:58.750 --> 15:00.138
- YEAH, I JUST HAVE A GIANT--

15:00.270 --> 15:01.749
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST THINK REAL
HARD ABOUT SOMETHING

15:01.900 --> 15:03.299
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED FROM US
AND JUST SHOOT FOR THE MOON.

15:03.450 --> 15:05.304
- WHAT?
- GO FOR IT.

15:05.450 --> 15:07.031
- OKAY.
GIVE ME A CAR.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.135
- A CAR--
TELL YOU WHAT.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.861
I'LL MEET YOU HALFWAY.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.034
$10 AN HOUR.
- THAT'S NOT HALFWAY.

15:11.180 --> 15:13.102
- JUST STOP.
STOP, STOP, STOP.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.047
NO MONEY IS EXCHANGING HANDS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

15:15.190 --> 15:16.145
TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING
TO WATCH YOUR BROTHER.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.427
ONLY YOUR BROTHER.

15:17.570 --> 15:18.969
I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT NORA'S COVERED.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.088
I'LL ALSO MAKE SURE HE LEAVES
YOU ALONE WHILE YOU'RE STUDYING.

15:21.230 --> 15:22.219
THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION.
YOU GOT IT?

15:22.360 --> 15:23.839
- OKAY.
- DONE?

15:23.990 --> 15:24.945
- YEAH.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.544
THANK YOU SO MUCH

15:30.680 --> 15:32.363
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.

15:32.510 --> 15:34.193
THIS IS SO LAST-MINUTE,
I KNOW.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.716
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

15:35.860 --> 15:37.088
- EVERYTHING'S IN HERE--
HER BOTTLES, HER NOOK,

15:37.240 --> 15:38.468
AND ALL OF HER PLAY TOYS
ARE IN THERE.

15:38.620 --> 15:39.894
- I CAN'T NURSE HER.
- DIAPERS--

15:40.040 --> 15:41.371
- SHE'S STILL ON...

15:41.520 --> 15:42.691
- BREAST MILK.
- OKAY.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.036
- YES, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.932
- I DON'T--
I CAN'T PROVIDE THAT.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.069
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.
HERE YOU GO.

15:47.220 --> 15:48.790
- AW.
- SAY HI, AUNT SARAH.

15:48.940 --> 15:49.929
SHE'S SLEEPY,
SLEEPY, SLEEP.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.116
SHE FELL ASLEEP IN THE CAR.

15:52.260 --> 15:53.488
SHE'S SO TIRED.
- LOOK AT HER.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.392
- I KNOW, THAT'S THE OUTFIT
YOU GOT HER.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.110
- YEAH, I LIKE
A JEAN JACKET ON A BABY.

15:57.260 --> 15:59.125
_WHAT CAN I SAY?
- [Sighs] YOU HAVE STYLE.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.535
- THANK YOU FOR
TAKING CARE OF AMBER.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.602
SHE'S SO EXCITED.
- OH, MY GOD, DID SHE TELL YOU?

16:03.750 --> 16:05.297
I'M SO EXCITED
THAT SHE'S GOING TO DO IT.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.749
I--AT FIRST, SHE WAS, LIKE,
"I AM NOT SURE,"

16:07.890 --> 16:10.131
AND SHE WAS HESITANT, BUT--
- SHE'S JUST NERVOUS.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.999
- BUT SHE'LL BE FINE.

THAT'S DONE
ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS,

24:40.580 --> 24:42.719
AND I'M JUST SOME PATHETIC GIRL

24:42.860 --> 24:43.849
THAT LISTENS
TO WHATEVER HER BOYFRIEND

24:43.990 --> 24:45.025
TELLS HER TO DO, RIGHT?

24:45.170 --> 24:46.125
- NO, ZOE.

24:46.270 --> 24:48.067
YOU'RE NOT PATHETIC.

24:48.210 --> 24:49.586
YOU'RE STRONG.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.348
YOU'RE PROBABLY STRONGER
THAN YOU KNOW.

24:52.490 --> 24:56.039
BUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO TAKE
MY DAUGHTER TO THE PARK.

24:59.530 --> 25:01.316
- I'M SO SORRY.

25:01.460 --> 25:04.634
- ME TOO.

25:04.770 --> 25:07.113
I WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT MOTHER
TO YOUR BABY.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.391
- NO, WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE MIGHT BE RIGHT NOW,

25:11.540 --> 25:14.395
BUT, IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING,
JUST PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL BACK.

25:14.540 --> 25:15.404

THANK YOU.

25:15.540 --> 25:17.121

HE WAS WEARING.

25:18.860 --> 25:21.237
WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO?
- GREAT.

25:21.380 --> 25:23.519
THE POLICE ASKED ME TO CALL
ALL OF MAX'S FRIENDS,

25:23.660 --> 25:25.616
AND SINCE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
FRIENDS,

25:25.760 --> 25:27.512
I'M JUST GOING DOWN THE LIST

25:27.660 --> 25:28.934

I WAS GONNA SAY THAT TOO.

25:40.260 --> 25:42.046
[laughter]

25:44.810 --> 25:45.560

TO VOICE MAIL.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.154
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

25:49.510 --> 25:51.569

27:18.420 --> 27:19.899
I WAS COMING DOWN

27:21.950 --> 27:23.838

27:23.980 --> 27:27.290

27:54.600 --> 27:56.454

27:57.770 --> 27:59.180
HE MADE ME PUT IT ON MY WRIST.

27:59.330 --> 28:00.638
- THAT'S CAUSE YOUR DAD'S
A REALLY SMART GUY,

28:00.780 --> 28:02.941
BECAUSE HE DID
THE EXACT RIGHT THING.

28:03.090 --> 28:04.364

ORDINARILY LEAVE A SEAT

28:49.690 --> 28:52.614

28:52.760 --> 28:55.866
BUT HE'S WORTH IT.

28:58.390 --> 28:59.584

28:59.730 --> 29:01.618
- I CANNOT DO THAT.
I WILL GET IN TROUBLE.

29:01.770 --> 29:03.453
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.521
FORGET IT.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.422

AND I CAN'T YELL AT HIM
FOR SOMETHING

32:15.310 --> 32:18.780
THAT'S NOT IN HIS CONTROL.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.488
- WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
WASN'T YOUR FAULT, HADDIE.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.579
IF ANYTHING, YOUR MOTHER AND I
SHOULD HAVE...

32:24.730 --> 32:27.290
DONE A BETTER JOB RESCHEDULING

34:42.040 --> 34:43.450
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

34:43.590 --> 34:45.831
- HONEY, I HAD MY PHONE
ON SILENT

34:45.980 --> 34:47.288
BECAUSE I WAS MAD AT YOU.

34:47.430 --> 34:49.694
IT'S MY FAULT.
OKAY?

34:49.840 --> 34:51.489
I'M HIS MOTHER.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.596
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU MORE.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.526
- [laughs]

35:42.690 --> 35:44.920
- YOU KNOW, WHEN JABBAR HURT
HIS WRIST YESTERDAY,

35:45.070 --> 35:47.823
DR. JOE WAS AT A FOOTBALL GAME.

35:47.970 --> 35:51.895
LIKE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME
AT THE 50-YARD LINE.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.622
AND HE CAME TO HELP JABBAR.

35:54.770 --> 35:59.764
WHICH WAS REALLY NICE.
IT WAS SUPER NICE.

35:59.910 --> 36:03.289
AND HE TREATS JABBAR
REALLY WELL.

36:03.430 --> 36:07.218
AND I'M GUESSING
THAT HE TREATS YOU THE SAME.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.913
- HE DOES.

36:10.060 --> 36:12.199
- AND YOU DESERVE THAT.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.020
- [scoffs]
NO, I DON'T.

36:16.170 --> 36:17.137
- YES, YOU DO.

36:17.270 --> 36:18.373
- NO, I DON'T.
- YEAH, YOU DO.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.613
- NO. HOW?
I'M DOING THE SAME THING

36:20.760 --> 36:22.273
YOU DID TO ME.

36:22.420 --> 36:27.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ABOUT
TO PUT HIM THROUGH THAT.

36:27.900 --> 36:29.595
- WELL, THEN, DON'T.

36:29.730 --> 36:31.903
- NOT SAY ANYTHING?
- I MEAN, IT'S YOUR DECISION,

36:32.050 --> 36:34.189
BUT, SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE,

36:34.330 --> 36:36.969
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD LOSE
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE

36:37.120 --> 36:39.497
FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T
HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE.

36:45.030 --> 36:48.431
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE A PART
OF ME THAT LOVES YOU.

36:48.580 --> 36:51.447
THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

36:51.580 --> 36:55.471
BUT I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT THAT PART

36:55.620 --> 36:58.248
KEEPS DOING HORRIBLE THINGS
TO YOU.

37:02.700 --> 37:05.214
YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.

37:08.220 --> 37:11.018
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

37:25.240 --> 37:28.687
[telephone rings]

37:28.830 --> 37:31.890
[ringing]

37:32.040 --> 37:34.201
- HI, THE LUNCHEONETTE.
THIS IS RACHEL.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.830
- HI, RACHEL,
IT'S KRISTINA BRAVERMAN,

37:36.970 --> 37:38.005
ADAM'S WIFE.

37:38.150 --> 37:40.072
- HI, MRS. BRAVERMAN.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.450
UM, ADAM ISN'T IN.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.012
- I KNOW. I'M ACTUALLY CALLING
TO TALK TO YOU.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.639
THAT THING THAT YOU DID
WITH MY HUSBAND--

37:48.780 --> 37:51.180
NOT COOL.
DON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN.

37:51.330 --> 37:54.879
YOU GOT IT?

37:55.030 --> 37:56.406
- I WILL NOT EVER.

37:56.550 --> 37:57.812
EVER AGAIN.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.440
- GOOD.
THEN I GUESS WE'RE GOOD.

38:00.580 --> 38:05.608
HAVE A GREAT DAY,
RACHEL.

38:13.870 --> 38:15.838
- WHAT ARE WE DOING TODAY?

38:15.980 --> 38:19.632
- UM, WE COULD DO
LOTS OF STUFF.

38:19.780 --> 38:21.156
WE COULD SIT ON THE COUCH
ALL DAY.

38:21.290 --> 38:22.291
- [snickers]

38:22.430 --> 38:23.874
- WE COULD SIT OVER THERE
ALL DAY.

38:24.020 --> 38:25.055
- [chuckles]

38:25.190 --> 38:28.262
- I'M SO TIRED.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.403
- AW.

38:31.550 --> 38:33.165
- IT WAS FUN, THOUGH.

38:33.310 --> 38:36.541
- IT WAS REALLY FUN.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.897
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I EVER SHOWED YOU THIS VIDEO.

38:39.040 --> 38:39.961
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

38:40.110 --> 38:41.589
LOOK WHO'S UP?

38:41.730 --> 38:43.038
- NORA, LOOK HOW PRETTY YOU ARE.

38:43.180 --> 38:44.966
- WHO'S THAT?
DO YOU SEE RIGHT HERE?

38:45.110 --> 38:46.839
- I'M SERIOUS.
I WASN'T JOKING AROUND.

38:46.970 --> 38:48.210
- YOU SEE RIGHT HERE.
WHO'S THAT?

38:48.360 --> 38:50.419
[gaSPSI
- AW.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.120
SHE'S CONCERNED.
IT'S ME.

38:53.260 --> 38:54.636
I'LL CUT OUT THE SCARY...

38:54.780 --> 38:57.988
I COULD TOTALLY SEE
HAVING A BABY WITH YOU.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.675
UM, I'M SORRY.

39:04.820 --> 39:08.267
IS THAT A WEIRD--
I DIDN'T...

39:08.410 --> 39:10.093
I JUST SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.686
I'M--I'M REALLY TIRED.

39:12.830 --> 39:16.061
AND I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT WHAT I'M SAYING.

39:16.210 --> 39:18.690
I'M SORRY.
I--MY BRAIN USUALLY FILTERS

39:18.830 --> 39:20.582
THAT STUFF OUT.
DID THAT--

39:20.730 --> 39:22.243
ARE YOU FREAKED OUT?
SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,

39:22.390 --> 39:26.076
HOW BADLY ARE YOU FREAKED OUT?

39:26.220 --> 39:28.074
YOU CAN BE HONEST.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.088
- TWO.

39:37.090 --> 39:40.162
- TWO WHERE ONE IS LOW
AND TEN IS HIGH?

39:40.300 --> 39:43.269
THEN REGULAR...

39:43.410 --> 39:44.991
TWO.

39:45.140 --> 39:46.892
- TWO.

39:47.030 --> 39:53.003
- REMEMBER WE SAID
WE WERE GONNA LIVE FOREVER

39:53.140 --> 39:59.045
AND WE WOULD PAINT OVER
THE WRITING ON THE WALL

39:59.180 --> 40:02.877
BUT SHE SAID SOME SAID
TOO WE'RE BLIND

40:03.020 --> 40:05.978
AND WAKE UP TO FIND

40:06.120 --> 40:11.979
WE ARE ONLY HUMAN
AFTER ALL

40:12.130 --> 40:16.817
WE ARE ONLY HUMAN
AFTER ALL

40:48.510 --> 40:54.096
STARIN' OUT
ACROSS THE LAKE

40:54.240 --> 40:58.131
THE HORIZON'S
TURNING RED

40:58.280 --> 41:01.408
AND GRAY

41:01.560 --> 41:07.214
WATCH THE WAVES
AS THEY FALL

41:07.360 --> 41:09.521
I GOT DREAMS LIKE

41:09.670 --> 41:12.184
- I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM,

41:12.330 --> 41:14.878
AND WE GOT INTO A HUGE FIGHT,
AND HE TOLD ME NOT TO COME HOME.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.942
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE ELSE TO GO.

41:17.090 --> 41:20.639
- ZOE.
- I CAN'T PROMISE YOU

41:20.780 --> 41:22.361
HE'S EVER GONNA COME AROUND.

41:22.510 --> 41:24.432
HE'S REALLY MAD AT ME.

41:24.580 --> 41:27.754
I DON'T THINK HE'S
EVER GONNA SIGN THOSE PAPERS.

41:27.890 --> 41:31.348
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THE BABY.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.869
- ZOE, JUST COME IN.

41:38.080 --> 41:42.494
- WE ARE ONLY HUMAN
AFTER ALL

41:44.050 --> 41:47.838
WE ARE ONLY HUMAN

41:47.980 --> 41:50.915
AFTER ALL

41:51.060 --> 41:52.812
- [sobs]
