Gael, I am so sorry.
I was only trying to help.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.655
Well, you didn't help.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.266
You stepped
way over the line, Isabella!

38:32.310 --> 38:35.225
How the hell am I supposed
to support us now, huh?

38:36.226 --> 38:37.837
I'm really so sorry.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.230
-I---
-No. I can't right now.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.243
[knocking on door]

38:55.594 --> 38:56.421
Hi.

38:57.465 --> 38:58.771
Uh, we're looking
for Casey Miller.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.730
That's my late husband.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.517
Oh. Um, I'm sorry for your loss.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.258
I'm-- I'm looking for my sister.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.521
And the last time I saw her,

39:09.564 --> 39:11.566
she was getting into a van
registered to him.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.133
Oh.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.048
Yeah, it was
a blue Ford Econoline.

39:15.091 --> 39:18.051
Yes, he used to have
a van like that,

39:18.094 --> 39:22.185
but we don't have it anymore.
I'm sorry.

39:22.751 --> 39:25.188
Well, do you happen to know
where it is?

39:25.232 --> 39:26.102
No.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.191
I really should start on dinner.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.281
You know--
That's a lovely passage.

39:33.893 --> 39:37.200
"As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord."
Joshua 24:15.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.072
You know it?

39:39.115 --> 39:40.856
Of course, it was Joshua's
last address

39:40.900 --> 39:42.075
to the tribes of Israel.

39:42.118 --> 39:43.381
It's my mom's favorite verse.

39:47.428 --> 39:48.516
Listen...

39:49.430 --> 39:52.390
I really don't know
where the van is.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.480
My son, Adam, has it.

39:56.176 --> 39:58.918
-Adam Miller?
-Yes.

39:58.961 --> 40:02.051
Okay. Do you by chance
have a number

40:02.095 --> 40:04.271
-or an address for him?
-I don't.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.621
We haven't spoken
in some time.

40:07.535 --> 40:08.667
I understand.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.800
Um, okay, well,
if you hear from him,

40:11.844 --> 40:13.236
will you give me a call?

40:13.280 --> 40:14.934
-Of course.
-Thank you.

40:15.891 --> 40:17.893
I do hope you find your sister.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.071
I'll be praying for you both.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.031
Thank you.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.078
Oh, I don't know wh--

40:36.999 --> 40:39.480
Well, now we know his real name.

40:40.307 --> 40:42.265
-Yeah.
-[car engine starting]

40:42.309 --> 40:44.311
How many Adam Millers
you think there are out there?

40:48.402 --> 40:49.838
[Mariana gasps]

40:57.411 --> 40:58.630
Adam's my brother.

40:58.673 --> 41:00.370
If your sister's with him,

41:00.414 --> 41:01.894
she's in danger.
