WEBVTT

00:04.094 --> 00:05.734
Oh, it's a kite.

00:05.892 --> 00:07.998
- Means freedom.
- Freedom.

00:08.004 --> 00:09.204
Francesca Doyle?

00:09.210 --> 00:11.896
We have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Michael Pennisi.

00:12.083 --> 00:13.410
No?!

00:13.416 --> 00:17.184
Look out, Franky's back. Now you're
gonna see what a real top dog's like.

00:17.190 --> 00:19.702
I'm onto you. You're never
gonna get away with it.

00:19.708 --> 00:21.591
Don't tell me, they think it was you.

00:22.262 --> 00:24.304
Go, Franky! Smash her!

00:24.310 --> 00:26.497
There's the old Franky Doyle.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.280
What happens if I stuff up?

00:28.286 --> 00:30.554
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be great.

00:33.240 --> 00:35.246
Have you ever seen this firearm before?

00:35.252 --> 00:36.452
Where'd you get it from?

00:36.458 --> 00:38.401
Hole in the wall at Aunty Joan's place.

00:40.357 --> 00:43.702
The DNA also puts this gun in your hand.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.326
Franky, you lied to me.

00:45.332 --> 00:48.499
Oh, so I'm a liar and a murderer,
is that it? Is that what you think?

00:48.505 --> 00:52.427
Getting out of here might take
a bit longer than you thought.

00:55.562 --> 00:57.594
She will be punished, Bea.

00:57.672 --> 00:59.797
Liz, you're not Witness X?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.226 --> 02:16.797
I trusted you...

02:16.803 --> 02:18.435
and you betrayed me.

02:18.592 --> 02:20.401
Nobody gets away with that.

02:28.388 --> 02:30.388
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

02:30.394 --> 02:32.607
- Count will commence in ten minutes.
- Oh.

02:34.801 --> 02:36.099
Oh!

02:36.609 --> 02:39.410
Take it easy. You'll knock somebody out.

02:39.416 --> 02:40.741
Morning!

02:45.993 --> 02:48.644
Today's the big day. You nervous?

02:48.742 --> 02:52.064
Oh, no. The prosecution
haven't got a leg to stand on.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.125
I mean, why do you think
they're resorting to this

02:54.131 --> 02:56.653
ridiculous mystery witness business?

02:56.734 --> 03:00.376
Hm! Another few days in here
and I'll be a free woman.

03:00.377 --> 03:04.661
In fact, everything in
my cell is up for grabs.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.950
You have been so supportive

03:07.458 --> 03:09.066
Especially you, Liz.

03:09.239 --> 03:10.621
You're my rock.

03:12.003 --> 03:14.349
- Oi, fuck off, chopsticks!
- Move your...

03:14.355 --> 03:15.916
- Calm it down!

03:16.735 --> 03:19.492
- Who's gonna act as a patient?
- Me! I will.

03:20.782 --> 03:23.918
Have you noticed that half the
women in here are off their nut?

03:24.032 --> 03:26.695
Yeah, there's some really
good stuff goin' around, eh?

03:27.518 --> 03:29.854
But... I... I haven't bought none.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.420
Well done, Susan.

03:31.426 --> 03:32.912
You're better than that.

03:33.029 --> 03:35.406
Never settle for being one of the herd.

03:35.412 --> 03:38.549
No. Spent all me money on
Monte Carlos anyway, so.

03:38.555 --> 03:39.826
- Oi?! Hey!
- Don't, you...!

03:39.832 --> 03:41.425
- Get off me!
- Enough now!

03:41.431 --> 03:43.105
- Break it up, the two of you!
- Shit gonna keep happening

03:43.111 --> 03:44.465
unless you do something.

03:44.471 --> 03:46.271
- Back to your tables!
- All right, all right!

03:46.382 --> 03:49.366
- Stevens, brawler's ready, let's go.
- Oh.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.880
Wish me luck.

03:51.886 --> 03:53.339
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

03:53.345 --> 03:54.545
- Good luck.
- Bye.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.727
Bye.

03:58.206 --> 03:59.411
Good luck.

03:59.417 --> 04:01.871
There's plenty of other
warehouses out there.

04:01.877 --> 04:04.561
Yeah, not for a microbrewery.
That site was perfect.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.851
Well, keep looking.
Something will turn up.

04:07.457 --> 04:08.657
Yeah.

04:08.865 --> 04:11.879
Oh, I'll transfer that ten
grand back into your account too.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.563
- You still might need it.
- No, I'll be right.

04:14.978 --> 04:17.079
Just... stay positive, all right?

04:17.084 --> 04:19.812
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound. All women

04:19.817 --> 04:21.860
- to report to assigned work duties.
- Hey.

04:22.031 --> 04:23.849
Tell Mercado I've got
another shipment coming in.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.367
- She needs to organise payment.
- Attention, all staff. Available

04:25.373 --> 04:27.562
- Okay.
- Officer to admissions for escort.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.768
- Jake?
- Yo!

04:28.777 --> 04:30.162
Mate, I've gotta do an induction.

04:30.168 --> 04:31.823
Can you take this to
H3. They're for Doyle.

04:31.829 --> 04:33.599
- Mate, I can't, I'm on Ferguson duty.
- Oh...

04:33.605 --> 04:36.062
- I'll take it. Yeah, yeah, no problem.
- Right. You sure?

04:36.068 --> 04:37.630
Ah, research for her case.

04:37.636 --> 04:40.040
- Let's hope it makes a difference.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

04:49.449 --> 04:50.842
These are for you.

04:51.341 --> 04:52.541
Thanks.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.444
Franky, it's not that
I don't believe you.

05:02.450 --> 05:04.813
I'm just trying to make
sense of all of this.

05:04.814 --> 05:07.127
Well, Ferguson's behind
it. I just have to prove it.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.041
Okay.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.981
So, how you gonna do that?

05:11.987 --> 05:13.993
Not sittin' here talkin' to you!

05:25.556 --> 05:27.201
You owe me!

05:27.207 --> 05:29.411
- I don't owe you shit!
- Hey?!

05:29.586 --> 05:31.381
There's screws outside
they're gonna hear ya.

05:31.387 --> 05:33.890
- Mind your own fuckin' business!
- You buying?

05:33.896 --> 05:35.807
- I got crank.
- Give it to me!

05:35.813 --> 05:39.466
- You bloody owe me!
- I owe you jack shit, now piss off!

05:43.776 --> 05:45.027
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:45.033 --> 05:46.946
- Stay back you fuckin' psycho.
- Take it easy.

05:47.072 --> 05:48.786
- Eh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

05:48.792 --> 05:50.208
- Just take it...
- Ugh!

05:50.214 --> 05:52.018
- Argh!
- Argh! Fuck!

05:52.024 --> 05:53.770
- Fuck!
- Ugh!

05:54.205 --> 05:55.410
Oh, fuck!

05:55.416 --> 05:56.616
Drop the shiv!

05:56.622 --> 05:58.814
- All right.
- Drop the shiv, Radic!

05:59.806 --> 06:01.636
Drop the fucking shiv!

06:01.642 --> 06:02.864
Fuckin' idiot!

06:03.133 --> 06:04.695
- What the hell's going on?
- Come on Chang.

06:04.701 --> 06:06.313
- I'm slotting these idiots!
- Come on.

06:06.319 --> 06:08.416
- Go too. Get down!
- Ha, fuck off!

06:08.422 --> 06:10.072
- No, it was self-defence.
- Keep moving. You know the

06:10.078 --> 06:12.223
- fuckin' rules. Jesus!
- You okay?

06:15.251 --> 06:16.478
Argh.

06:16.548 --> 06:18.757
Oh, shit!

06:18.907 --> 06:20.425
Okay, come on, let's go.

06:29.942 --> 06:31.862
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

06:31.868 --> 06:34.772
They were doing a drug
deal in the shower block.

06:35.947 --> 06:37.978
You're supposed to deal with this.

06:38.032 --> 06:42.578
I don't get it, Kaz. You hate
drugs, just as much as Bea did.

06:43.488 --> 06:45.097
I had to do a deal.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.481
With who?

06:49.199 --> 06:50.722
Tina Mercado.

06:51.004 --> 06:52.498
Are you kidding me?

06:52.504 --> 06:55.718
When I took over I needed to know
that all the women were onside.

06:56.709 --> 06:59.213
I made a mistake, I know, and I'm sorry.

06:59.214 --> 07:00.785
I will fix this.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.079
Allie...

07:03.579 --> 07:05.861
if I don't do this carefully, I am out.

07:05.867 --> 07:08.916
And someone like Tina or
Jucie'll be running the prison.

07:08.922 --> 07:10.875
Proctor, what are you doing in here?

07:11.548 --> 07:12.950
Just checkin' on my friend.

07:17.429 --> 07:18.629
Hey...

07:19.219 --> 07:20.815
don't worry about me.

07:22.118 --> 07:23.602
Protect the women.

07:23.703 --> 07:25.520
Proctor, out!

07:30.882 --> 07:34.507
Ah, you're late. I can
only give you five minutes.

07:34.513 --> 07:37.129
I'm sure that'll be long
enough for both of us.

07:37.225 --> 07:39.038
So, how are you settling back in?

07:39.044 --> 07:41.642
I never settle, Miss Westfall.

07:41.915 --> 07:46.265
In this instance I'm prepared to
admit that I may have been outplayed,

07:46.271 --> 07:48.439
but, you know, it's a long game.

07:48.445 --> 07:50.479
Between you and...

07:50.682 --> 07:52.082
who, exactly?

07:54.288 --> 07:56.406
Tell me, how's Franky coping?

07:58.114 --> 08:00.299
I'm not discussing other inmates.

08:00.634 --> 08:03.337
Must be quite a... shock to the system.

08:03.405 --> 08:06.525
Still, emotional attachment
always comes at a price, hmmm?

08:06.531 --> 08:08.879
And what would you know
about emotional attachment?

08:08.885 --> 08:10.693
She told you her conspiracy theory.

08:10.807 --> 08:13.406
She thinks I'm responsible for
bringing her back into Wentworth.

08:13.412 --> 08:14.860
Well, that would be
ridiculous, wouldn't it?

08:14.866 --> 08:16.679
No, Franky's always
had a vivid imagination.

08:16.685 --> 08:18.200
She's highly intuitive.

08:20.100 --> 08:24.155
I hope that Vera is supporting
you through this trying time.

08:24.161 --> 08:27.119
You know a good Governor
protects her staff.

08:27.125 --> 08:29.333
Forgives their indiscretions.

08:29.339 --> 08:31.334
All right, I think we're done here.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.722
- Ah, Officer Stewart?
- You know I feel for you,

08:33.729 --> 08:35.157
Miss Westfall. Mmm...

08:35.163 --> 08:38.457
Franky's right in front of you and
she's just a million miles away.

08:39.578 --> 08:43.206
If it's any consolation, you know,
I think Franky's struggling too.

08:43.664 --> 08:46.395
The pain and the rage just...

08:46.401 --> 08:48.891
simmering beneath the surface.

08:48.897 --> 08:50.097
Joan...

08:50.103 --> 08:53.095
find somewhere else to
workshop your monologues.

08:53.101 --> 08:56.693
Don't you worry, Miss Westfall, I'm
sure your secret's safe with Vera.

09:04.473 --> 09:06.662
- Franky! You need to speak to me,

09:06.668 --> 09:08.072
I just spoke to Ferguson.

09:08.073 --> 09:11.227
- What'd she say?
- She was trying way too hard

09:11.233 --> 09:12.647
to make me suspicious.

09:14.018 --> 09:16.544
She wants us to think
that she's responsible,

09:16.550 --> 09:18.532
which means she's probably not.

09:19.127 --> 09:20.534
So, you still don't believe me?

09:20.540 --> 09:22.424
No, she's more interested in us.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.418
Ferguson's the only
thing that makes sense.

09:24.424 --> 09:27.950
Franky, you're not listening. Ferguson
has worked out that we're together.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.581
If Corrections find out,
your career's fucked.

09:31.291 --> 09:34.687
I'm going to hire a private
investigator to look into Pennisi, okay.

09:34.693 --> 09:36.022
What? No way!

09:36.028 --> 09:37.897
I'm just not gonna sit
around and do nothing.

09:37.903 --> 09:40.309
- It'll link ya to me.
- I don't care!

09:41.028 --> 09:43.403
I love you. I'm not going
to let you rot in here.

09:44.426 --> 09:46.397
Until I get outta here, Gidge,

09:46.403 --> 09:48.957
I don't wanna see or hear
from you anymore, okay?

09:50.208 --> 09:51.833
Just stay away.

10:05.016 --> 10:06.594
- Eh?
- Hey.

10:07.806 --> 10:10.594
I bet you can't wait to
get out of this place, hey?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.800
I'm kinda jealous.

10:11.806 --> 10:14.482
Oh, love, you've only got
another six months. You'll be back

10:14.488 --> 10:16.152
with your boys before you know it.

10:16.158 --> 10:17.358
- Mmm.
- Hey?

10:17.364 --> 10:18.583
Canteen is now open to H Block.

10:18.589 --> 10:19.940
When are the cops calling you up?

10:19.946 --> 10:22.239
Oh, Don reckons in a coupla days.

10:22.245 --> 10:23.543
Yeah, the prosecution have gotta

10:23.549 --> 10:25.419
few more witnesses they
gotta get through first.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.117
- Oh, right.
- Which is good,

10:27.123 --> 10:30.151
'cause it gives me more time
to memorise my bloody statement.

10:30.157 --> 10:32.823
Just tell the truth and you'll be fine.

10:33.123 --> 10:35.433
- Yeah.
- Birdsworth!

10:35.811 --> 10:37.319
Governor wants to see ya.

10:38.225 --> 10:39.499
- See ya.
- See ya.

10:44.079 --> 10:45.368
Liz...

10:45.806 --> 10:47.748
Mm, shouldn't you be at the trial?

10:47.923 --> 10:49.263
Thanks, Ms Bennett.

10:53.636 --> 10:54.836
What's happened?

10:54.842 --> 10:57.090
Look, I hate to have to spring
this on you, but the prosecution

10:57.096 --> 10:59.244
want you in the witness
stand tomorrow afternoon.

10:59.418 --> 11:01.918
- God, you said I had a coupla days.
- Yeah, I know,

11:01.924 --> 11:03.566
- I know, and that was the plan, but
- Yeah.

11:03.572 --> 11:06.487
The defence have already discredited
most of the physical evidence.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.674
- So it's down to me?
- Well, your testimony's crucial.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.152
- Oh!
- But don't panic,

11:11.158 --> 11:12.506
it's okay, you got this.

11:12.512 --> 11:15.618
- Okay, just stick to the statement.
- Yeah, but th-that's the thing, right,

11:15.624 --> 11:19.192
because, my memory is all over
the shop and I can't retain

11:19.198 --> 11:21.217
- anything!
- Yeah, yeah, but that's just nerves.

11:21.223 --> 11:22.628
Look, you're gonna be fine.

11:22.634 --> 11:24.628
You're gonna be fine.
Just visualise the story.

11:24.634 --> 11:25.905
- Stick to the main points.
- Yeah. Mmm.

11:25.911 --> 11:28.060
Hey, we'll go over the statement
again. We'll keep going over it

11:28.066 --> 11:29.858
until you're a hundred
percent comfortable.

11:29.864 --> 11:32.280
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay? Okay.

11:33.379 --> 11:34.991
I believe in you, Liz.

11:34.997 --> 11:36.868
Don't you ever forget that.

11:47.065 --> 11:48.999
I can't wait till you get outta here.

11:50.573 --> 11:51.773
Me too.

11:53.255 --> 12:00.375
So, Joan Ferguson hired someone
to kill Mike Pennisi and frame you?

12:00.381 --> 12:02.984
- Mm-hmm.
- With a gun with your DNA on it?

12:03.235 --> 12:06.474
Oh, come on, Franky, this is nuts!

12:06.841 --> 12:10.403
Unless you can explain to me how
your DNA ended up on that gun,

12:10.409 --> 12:12.045
there's... I can't help you.

12:12.051 --> 12:15.442
I took it off Shayne
Butler, Ferguson's godson.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.731
What... what's Shayne
doing with a handgun?

12:17.737 --> 12:21.572
Well, it belonged to Ferguson. She
wanted him to use it on Nils Jesper.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.953
Oh, God, they're still
looking for the gunman!

12:23.959 --> 12:27.140
Yeah, well it wasn't Shayne. I talked
him down and I threw it in a dumpster.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.335
Ferguson must've had someone
follow me and pick it up.

12:29.341 --> 12:31.781
- Okay, where was Shayne at this point?
- He'd gone.

12:31.787 --> 12:35.149
He didn't shoot Pennisi or
anyone else. He's not a killer.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.860
Why haven't you told me,
or the police about this?

12:37.866 --> 12:40.943
Because, I don't want Shayne
arrested for possession of a firearm,

12:40.949 --> 12:42.236
or worse!

12:42.242 --> 12:45.311
You need a defence,
and... and this boy...

12:45.317 --> 12:47.444
is the only hope you've got.

12:47.450 --> 12:48.899
If he gets arrested,

12:48.905 --> 12:51.348
they're gonna send him to
Walford as soon as he turns 18.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.055
Yeah, and if he stays quiet,

12:53.061 --> 12:55.975
you might be stuck in here
for the rest of your life.

13:00.037 --> 13:01.366
Attention, compound.

13:01.372 --> 13:03.318
H Block are now called to dinner.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.679
Think I might just take
Franky a tray or somethin'.

13:05.685 --> 13:08.484
No, no, no, leave it. She
wants to be left alone.

13:08.490 --> 13:09.796
Well, uh...

13:09.802 --> 13:12.119
one minute she's, like, jumpin' on me

13:12.125 --> 13:14.399
and tellin' me she misses
me and everything... and

13:14.405 --> 13:16.425
then the next she won't even talk to me.

13:17.773 --> 13:19.266
I don't understand.

13:19.272 --> 13:22.193
Oh, love, she's just gettin'
used to be being back.

13:22.199 --> 13:23.797
She doesn't belong here anymore.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.227
Why's everything have
to fuckin' change?!

13:26.310 --> 13:29.102
- Change sucks!
- Hey, you've changed.

13:29.108 --> 13:30.893
- I have not!
- Yeah.

13:30.899 --> 13:32.665
You used to be a pain in the arse.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.942
Hey? You were.

13:36.128 --> 13:37.723
If everything stayed the same

13:37.729 --> 13:39.203
- it'd be boring, Booms.
- Mmm.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.446
Nah, it wouldn't.

13:40.924 --> 13:42.823
'Cause Maxie'd still be here, eh?

13:42.829 --> 13:45.381
I reckon you need a job
or a hobby or somethin',

13:45.387 --> 13:46.709
- love, to keep ya busy.
- Mmm.

13:46.715 --> 13:48.218
- Like what?
- Mmm, I dunno.

13:48.397 --> 13:50.116
Hey, Kaz, want anything done?

13:50.122 --> 13:51.702
- Boomer needs somethin' to do.
- Oh, look, don't...

13:51.708 --> 13:53.512
- Nah, all good.
- Oh.

13:53.598 --> 13:54.997
Hey, Sonia, how'd it go?!

13:55.003 --> 13:56.390
I just need to ask...

13:56.396 --> 13:59.162
Which one of you bitches is Witness X?!

13:59.168 --> 14:00.368
Eh?

14:01.945 --> 14:04.015
Come on, speak up!

14:04.021 --> 14:05.837
Stevens get your food
and sit down, please.

14:05.843 --> 14:08.508
I received a copy of the statement
today and it's perfectly obvious

14:08.514 --> 14:10.901
one of you women is
fabricating evidence against me.

14:10.907 --> 14:13.544
- Stevens!
- All right... I'm going,

14:13.935 --> 14:15.744
but I'll find out who it is.

14:19.273 --> 14:21.881
It's probably Liz, eh,
'cause she loves a good lag.

14:21.887 --> 14:23.193
- Boomer, shut up!
- Don't ya, eh?!

14:23.199 --> 14:24.665
- Shut the fuck up!
- Eh?!

14:24.671 --> 14:26.965
They're best mates. It could
be anyone, it could be you?

14:26.971 --> 14:28.318
- Yeah!
- I'm not a lagger.

14:28.324 --> 14:30.942
All right, calm your
farm. Just eat your dinner.

14:42.538 --> 14:44.629
Sonia never confessed, did she?

14:44.635 --> 14:46.058
You're making it up.

14:47.655 --> 14:49.284
Why would you lie?

14:49.460 --> 14:52.161
Because I really wanna
get outta here, Dor.

14:52.358 --> 14:56.849
And because the woman she murdered
and her kids deserve justice.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.069
That's why.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.412
If anyone find out
about this, you're dead.

15:01.623 --> 15:03.348
They're not gonna find out.

15:05.052 --> 15:06.252
Are they?

15:14.921 --> 15:16.121
Couldn't sleep?

15:16.127 --> 15:18.097
Oh, no.

15:18.207 --> 15:19.684
Mmm. Mmm.

15:19.973 --> 15:23.687
It's times like these I
crave my insomnia pills.

15:23.693 --> 15:24.893
Ha.

15:26.558 --> 15:30.058
Anyway, I've been lying
awake, thinking it over...

15:31.017 --> 15:32.634
and I've worked it out.

15:34.651 --> 15:36.845
I know who Witness X is.

15:40.304 --> 15:42.421
Mmm, who?

15:44.169 --> 15:46.324
Maxine Conway.

15:48.370 --> 15:51.066
- Why do you say that?
- Well, it makes perfect sense.

15:51.072 --> 15:53.725
Moving to Barnhurst was
a terrific cover story.

15:53.731 --> 15:56.304
I mean, it's such a betrayal
though, don't you think?

15:56.310 --> 15:59.210
I mean, to think I even offered
to buy her some new breasts!

15:59.415 --> 16:02.107
- And you really reckon it's Maxie?
- No question.

16:03.983 --> 16:06.288
Well, what did the statement say?

16:06.294 --> 16:09.999
Oh, some nonsense about me
confessing to Helen's murder.

16:11.955 --> 16:14.540
Wow, I... I don't
understand it, I mean why...

16:14.642 --> 16:16.735
- why would she lie?
- Who knows?

16:16.853 --> 16:18.631
Early release, possibly.

16:19.625 --> 16:22.023
But, I don't want you
to worry about it, Liz...

16:22.464 --> 16:25.332
Witness X will get what's coming.

16:26.544 --> 16:28.765
Liars always come undone.

16:40.710 --> 16:42.110
How you feeling, Liz?

16:42.408 --> 16:45.063
- You ready? Mm-hmm.
- Ah, yep, I think so.

16:45.069 --> 16:46.752
Did you arrange the cover
story for your work unit?

16:46.758 --> 16:49.405
Yeah, yeah. I told the women
that I was having chest pain,

16:49.411 --> 16:50.715
and I went to medical.

16:50.721 --> 16:52.687
Uh, but I reckon it's still suss,

16:52.693 --> 16:54.852
me disappearing the same
day Sonia goes to court.

16:54.858 --> 16:56.505
Yeah, you... you're
covered, Liz. You're covered.

16:56.511 --> 16:58.000
You won't be coming back here anyway.

16:58.096 --> 16:59.648
We've got some civvies for you.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.603
You can get changed here. You'll
leave the prison through a back exit.

17:02.819 --> 17:04.806
And wh-what happens again
when we get to the court,

17:04.811 --> 17:06.583
are you sure I'm not gonna see Sonia?

17:06.589 --> 17:08.596
No, you won't anywhere
near the courtroom

17:08.602 --> 17:09.932
until Stevens has been cleared.

17:09.938 --> 17:11.304
Then you'll go in and
give your evidence.

17:11.310 --> 17:13.464
Yeah, but people are gonna see me
and th-they're gonna know my name.

17:13.470 --> 17:15.365
Nuh, your identity will be suppressed.

17:15.371 --> 17:17.794
Court will be cleared, then
you'll give your evidence.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.000
And then what?

17:19.006 --> 17:21.380
You'll be release on parole immediately.

17:25.665 --> 17:26.877
Right, so the...

17:28.089 --> 17:29.565
- This is it?
- Mm-hmm.

17:30.479 --> 17:33.074
I don't... I don't get
to say goodbye to anyone.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.461
- No, you can't. Nuh.
- Nuh.

17:35.617 --> 17:37.240
We've arranged temporary accommodation

17:37.246 --> 17:39.259
for you in a new
apartment, near the city.

17:39.265 --> 17:40.564
Social worker will meet you there,

17:40.570 --> 17:42.130
and they'll have your personal affects.

17:45.394 --> 17:47.113
I can't actually believe it's happening.

17:47.532 --> 17:48.732
Sorry.

17:49.281 --> 17:50.797
You deserve it, Liz.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.697
It's the first day of your new life.

17:53.796 --> 17:54.996
Yeah.

18:06.770 --> 18:07.970
Hey!

18:10.172 --> 18:11.590
- You good?
- Yeah.

18:11.596 --> 18:12.796
Are you okay?

18:12.976 --> 18:14.272
Well, I've been better.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.115
You actually get anything on Joan?

18:18.830 --> 18:20.455
Well, she didn't deny it.

18:21.447 --> 18:23.260
Wish I could do something.

18:23.525 --> 18:25.346
Yeah, well maybe you can.

18:27.447 --> 18:29.246
Look, I hate to ask this...

18:29.252 --> 18:31.207
and there's absolutely no pressure...

18:31.381 --> 18:33.409
but you're the only person
who could tell the police

18:33.415 --> 18:34.894
where that gun came from.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.913
You can prove it was Ferguson's.

18:38.092 --> 18:40.095
How much would I have to tell them?

18:40.621 --> 18:42.029
Everything...

18:42.308 --> 18:44.113
but you wouldn't have to do it alone.

18:44.119 --> 18:46.361
You'd have Fessler, so
you'd have representation.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.480
I might get charged with possession.

18:51.504 --> 18:54.018
Look, I totally understand
if you don't wanna do it.

18:54.287 --> 18:55.981
You know, if I was
sittin' where you were...

18:55.987 --> 18:58.666
If it was you, you would already
be at the cop shop, Franky.

19:00.369 --> 19:01.569
Hey...

19:02.166 --> 19:04.548
I'll do it, all right?

19:04.735 --> 19:06.259
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:12.155 --> 19:13.355
You ready?

19:13.954 --> 19:15.154
Yeah.

19:15.934 --> 19:17.134
Hmmm.

19:21.814 --> 19:23.736
Thanks for everything, Miss Bennett.

19:24.113 --> 19:25.728
I really appreciate it.

19:26.558 --> 19:27.987
Good luck, Liz.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.560
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

19:41.566 --> 19:43.853
D Block are now called to lunch.

19:47.644 --> 19:48.844
Hey!

19:48.850 --> 19:50.256
Franky, come in front of me.

19:52.075 --> 19:54.180
- There you go, Franks.
- Oh, thanks, Dors.

19:54.464 --> 19:57.827
Hey. So, like, are you... are
you gonna hang out with us, or...

19:57.833 --> 19:59.124
Yeah, sure.

19:59.130 --> 20:00.509
Oh, awesome.

20:00.515 --> 20:02.827
That's really cool, eh? That's... cool.

20:03.116 --> 20:04.626
Ha! Hey, if, um...

20:04.632 --> 20:07.621
if you don't want your apple
crumble, just give it to me.

20:08.189 --> 20:10.690
- Nothin's changed, eh?
- Nuh.

20:11.441 --> 20:13.311
Hey, d'you speak to that Shayne kid?

20:13.522 --> 20:15.651
Yeah, he's makin' a statement this arvo.

20:16.209 --> 20:17.964
Part of me wishes he said no.

20:19.022 --> 20:21.944
Hey, any word from Liz, is she okay?

20:21.950 --> 20:23.561
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, they'd, um...

20:23.567 --> 20:25.202
they just reckon it's
a bit of indigestion,

20:25.208 --> 20:27.176
so they're keepin' her in
medical for the afternoon.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.715
Indigestion!

20:30.768 --> 20:32.158
Allie all right?

20:33.181 --> 20:34.695
Heard about her little accident.

20:35.283 --> 20:37.524
These junkies are just
gettin' out of hand.

20:37.530 --> 20:40.178
You know, Bea Smith would've
taken control by now.

20:40.646 --> 20:42.544
Course, she was her own boss.

20:44.964 --> 20:46.757
Out of the way, coming through.

20:46.950 --> 20:48.841
Coming through, let's go.

20:50.102 --> 20:52.674
That is the third drug
related incident this week.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.994
What the hell is going on?

20:54.000 --> 20:56.274
You're right, I'm sorry. We
all need to be more vigilant.

20:56.383 --> 20:58.380
All right, organise a
cell toss, right away.

20:58.386 --> 21:00.690
- Shall I call the Dog Squad?
- No, we can handle it.

21:00.696 --> 21:02.522
It's the whole prison, not just H Block.

21:02.528 --> 21:04.698
Right, schedule a staff meeting
for first thing tomorrow.

21:04.704 --> 21:06.284
I'm going to put a rocket up everyone.

21:06.290 --> 21:08.313
- Yes, Governor.
- And talk to Proctor,

21:08.319 --> 21:10.103
she's anti-drugs. She
might be able to help.

21:10.109 --> 21:11.798
- Yep, will do. I'll keep you posted.
- Compound. All women to report

21:11.804 --> 21:13.626
to assigned work duties.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.918
So, why'd you see Shayne
Butler this morning?

21:16.924 --> 21:19.503
- You been checkin' up on me?
- Well, you won't bloody talk to me!

21:19.515 --> 21:20.966
I told you to stay away.

21:20.972 --> 21:23.035
Hey, listen, I know a lot of people

21:23.041 --> 21:24.726
have let you down, but
I'm not one of them.

21:24.732 --> 21:27.455
- Now, you've gotta let me help you.
- What's the point?!

21:27.461 --> 21:29.770
We can't even be seen
together. It's over!

21:30.151 --> 21:32.450
- I don't accept that.
- I don't give a fuck.

21:32.456 --> 21:35.002
If Ferguson sees us and tells
the board you'll lose your job.

21:35.008 --> 21:36.971
Well, I'm thinking of
telling them anyway.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.081
- That's fucked!
- No, I can't have Ferguson

21:39.087 --> 21:40.813
- dictate my future.
- No, you can't give up

21:40.819 --> 21:42.298
- everything, 'cause of Ferguson...
- I don't care, I'll just get another

21:42.304 --> 21:43.504
bloody job!

21:43.510 --> 21:45.569
I'll visit you. And I'll wait for you!

21:45.575 --> 21:48.756
- And what if you're waiting forever?
- Well, then, I'll wait forever!

21:50.345 --> 21:51.745
Well, you're an idiot!

21:51.751 --> 21:53.221
Nothing you say

21:53.227 --> 21:55.678
- will change my mind, Franky, again.
- Don't!

22:08.977 --> 22:10.177
Tina?

22:13.602 --> 22:15.903
I need you to stop supplying
the women for awhile.

22:16.171 --> 22:17.649
Are you serious?

22:17.782 --> 22:19.842
- Why?
- Are you fucking stupid?

22:19.848 --> 22:21.559
Because someone nearly died today.

22:21.637 --> 22:24.254
She couldn't handle her
shit, not my problem.

22:24.434 --> 22:26.059
I am asking you,

22:26.065 --> 22:28.257
because I know you're not stupid!

22:28.263 --> 22:30.986
Just lay off the gear for
a couple of weeks, okay?

22:31.970 --> 22:33.395
Or what?

22:33.494 --> 22:34.971
What are you gonna do?

22:35.362 --> 22:38.182
I'll find out how it's coming
in and I will shut you down.

22:38.188 --> 22:41.653
- We had a deal.
- Deals change. Lay off the gear!

22:41.659 --> 22:44.143
That gear is the only
reason you're Top Dog.

22:44.721 --> 22:47.033
Just do as you are fucking told!

23:04.342 --> 23:06.442
Liz, we're ready.

23:23.552 --> 23:25.176
- Just... shh, shh, shh, shh.
- What?

23:25.182 --> 23:27.763
- What's goin' on? Oh, Jesus!
- It's all right.

23:27.769 --> 23:28.969
It's Sonia!

23:29.231 --> 23:31.307
- No, no, it's okay.
- Well, did she... did she see me?

23:31.313 --> 23:33.643
- No. No! No!
- Did she see me?! Fuck!

23:33.649 --> 23:35.557
What the fuck was that?!
There's s'posed to be protocols.

23:35.563 --> 23:36.867
Well, I'm sorry. That
shouldn't have happened.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.868
- Fuck!
- W-well, we gotta keep movin',

23:38.874 --> 23:40.579
- otherwise they're...
- No, no. I need a minute.

23:40.585 --> 23:42.561
- Liz, we need to...
- Just give me a minute!

23:44.172 --> 23:45.439
Oh, fuck!

23:47.148 --> 23:49.476
The identity of this
witness is protected.

23:49.545 --> 23:52.485
The use of any recording
device is a federal offence.

24:04.205 --> 24:05.717
Please stand.

24:11.499 --> 24:15.647
I swear by Almighty God, that the
evidence I shall give will be the truth

24:15.653 --> 24:18.296
the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.

24:18.567 --> 24:20.880
Thank you. You may sit down.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.925
Vera's given the okay
for a counselling session.

24:32.629 --> 24:34.918
Come on, let's talk about this.

24:34.924 --> 24:37.418
There's nothin' to talk
about, you can't fix this.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.942
Franky, I'm just tryin' to help.

24:40.927 --> 24:42.753
Well, why don't you try believin' me?

24:43.073 --> 24:45.034
Or maybe that's it. You
never really trusted me,

24:45.040 --> 24:46.438
I'm just a bit of rough trade.

24:46.444 --> 24:49.186
- Franky, you know that's not true.
- Isn't it?!

24:49.565 --> 24:51.550
Maybe this is where I belong.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.996
Behind bars, like a fuckin' bad girl.

24:54.637 --> 24:56.348
- Ugh!
- Fuck off!

24:56.653 --> 24:58.942
- Franky...
- Or maybe that's what turns you on?

24:58.948 --> 25:01.558
- I'm you big fuckin' prison fantasy!
- Don't you do this.

25:01.564 --> 25:02.768
Well, come on. Let's go!

25:02.774 --> 25:04.918
- Let's fuck, right? Huh?
- Stop! Stop it!

25:04.924 --> 25:06.595
- Stop it!
- Come on. No, don't worry about it.

25:06.601 --> 25:07.801
- I can handle it.
- Fuck!

25:07.807 --> 25:09.597
- This is what you want, isn't it?
- Fuck!

25:09.603 --> 25:12.057
- Huh? Just one last time.
- Fuck this shit!

25:12.064 --> 25:13.435
- I know you want it.
- What are you doing?! What are you...

25:13.441 --> 25:14.705
- Fuck you!
- I'm tryin' to get you off

25:14.711 --> 25:16.042
like a fuckin' crim!

25:22.542 --> 25:25.080
Fuck off, Franky! Fuck!

25:26.617 --> 25:28.640
What the hell are you fuckin' doing?

25:28.797 --> 25:30.867
You wanna push me away?

25:30.995 --> 25:32.713
You fuckin' failed!

25:33.199 --> 25:35.314
Wanted to hurt me, hmm?

25:35.606 --> 25:37.964
Congratulations, baby.

25:53.376 --> 25:54.576
Oh.

26:20.081 --> 26:21.281
You okay?

26:22.028 --> 26:23.228
Yeah.

26:25.037 --> 26:26.945
I need to show you something...

26:28.393 --> 26:30.806
Ferguson had this sent to the Ombudsman.

26:30.812 --> 26:34.309
It's a letter detailing your
continued involvement with Franky

26:34.315 --> 26:36.519
and my knowledge of the relationship.

26:37.816 --> 26:40.511
The Ombudsman's coming in
this afternoon to discuss it.

26:42.332 --> 26:44.014
I'm so sorry.

26:44.020 --> 26:45.637
No. This isn't about you,

26:45.643 --> 26:47.299
or Franky.

26:47.914 --> 26:50.716
It's me she's after. She
wants to ruin my career.

26:52.124 --> 26:54.835
I'll, um, I'll resign...

26:55.193 --> 26:57.335
and, um... so, I'll...

26:57.522 --> 26:58.725
I'll just quit.

26:58.731 --> 27:01.605
You deny everything and just...

27:02.600 --> 27:05.484
just blame me, Vera. Just blame me.

27:05.543 --> 27:08.145
Know you shouldn't make a rash
decision in a negative frame of mind.

27:08.151 --> 27:09.758
I'm sure you told me that once.

27:10.674 --> 27:12.768
Yeah, it sounds like me.

27:14.878 --> 27:16.774
I don't want you to leave.

27:20.260 --> 27:22.565
Please tell the court where you were

27:22.571 --> 27:25.395
when this conversation
with Ms Stevens took place.

27:25.463 --> 27:29.080
Uh, I-I was in the Wentworth
Correctional Centre,

27:29.086 --> 27:32.287
in one of the H Block exercise yards.

27:32.293 --> 27:34.427
Please tell the court what happened.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.540
Right, well,

27:36.546 --> 27:39.854
w-we were talking about the news on TV,

27:39.860 --> 27:41.910
'cause they'd just shown
a report about the police

27:41.916 --> 27:43.456
finding Helen's body.

27:43.631 --> 27:45.772
And that's when Sonia confessed.

27:45.937 --> 27:48.051
What did she say, exactly.

27:48.371 --> 27:51.050
Well, she said... I killed her.

27:51.364 --> 27:54.643
I killed Helen Masters
and buried the body.

27:54.747 --> 27:57.381
Did Ms Stevens appear upset...

27:57.848 --> 28:00.054
- during her confession?
- No.

28:01.043 --> 28:04.133
- Did she appear remorseful?
- Objection.

28:04.200 --> 28:05.521
I'll allow that.

28:06.967 --> 28:08.967
No, she didn't.

28:09.084 --> 28:10.461
Then what happened?

28:10.467 --> 28:13.273
Well, uh, I thought she was joking,

28:13.279 --> 28:17.146
but then she told me how she
did it, how she killed her.

28:17.224 --> 28:20.214
Please tell the
court exactly what she said.

28:20.623 --> 28:24.302
Um... she was with Helen in the kitchen,

28:24.308 --> 28:26.837
it was about 1:00 PM after lunch,

28:26.930 --> 28:29.657
she hit Helen over
the head with a bottle,

28:29.663 --> 28:31.532
Helen fell down,

28:31.644 --> 28:36.664
and then Sonia... u-used...
used the belt to... strangle her.

28:37.234 --> 28:41.870
So, Helen died violently in
the kitchen of Ms Stevens' home?

28:42.078 --> 28:43.278
Yes.

28:43.984 --> 28:46.219
What did Ms Stevens say happened next?

28:46.531 --> 28:50.464
Well, she dragged Helen's body
into the garage and then...

28:50.470 --> 28:51.942
shaved her head.

28:57.062 --> 28:58.455
Then what did she do?

28:58.873 --> 29:02.875
She put the body in the car
and drove it up to Sassafras.

29:02.881 --> 29:06.576
Did Ms Stevens tell you what she
did when she got to her destination?

29:06.678 --> 29:08.694
She parked at the side of a bush track

29:08.700 --> 29:11.894
and she buried Helen's
body in a shallow grave.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.260
Well, she said it wasn't very
deep because she had to...

29:14.345 --> 29:16.450
dig it out with her
own hands and then...

29:16.456 --> 29:18.887
she said it took ages to get the...

29:19.275 --> 29:22.018
dirt out from under her nails.

29:41.158 --> 29:43.249
I've just met with the Ombudsman.

29:44.286 --> 29:47.851
I do hope you're not intending to
persecute me for speaking the truth.

29:50.732 --> 29:54.894
Uh, last time you managed to persuade
him to overturn the board's decision,

29:54.900 --> 29:56.706
but you can't have it both ways.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.218
Presumption of innocence
stands for Ms Westfall as well.

29:59.224 --> 30:00.716
Unless you have proof of your claims?

30:00.722 --> 30:04.963
You know as well as I do that
she's... involved with Doyle.

30:05.143 --> 30:08.897
Well, as I explained to the
Ombudsman, when you were Governor

30:08.903 --> 30:11.215
you were threatened by
Ms Westfall's insight

30:11.221 --> 30:14.131
into your mental imbalance, you
attempted to marginalise her,

30:14.137 --> 30:15.658
and listened to prison gossip.

30:15.664 --> 30:17.851
- Which you provided.
- The Ombudsman now understands

30:17.857 --> 30:21.647
that Ms Westfall is a valued,
responsible member of staff.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.781
You, on the other hand, have yet
another black mark against your name.

30:25.787 --> 30:29.427
All this letter has achieved is
to discredit you even further.

30:33.169 --> 30:34.369
Okay.

30:35.581 --> 30:36.781
That all?

30:38.058 --> 30:40.591
Would you escort Ms
Ferguson back to her unit?

30:49.128 --> 30:50.997
Before we recap your testimony,

30:51.003 --> 30:53.334
I'd like to hear about
your time in prison.

30:53.628 --> 30:55.800
During your incarceration
you've been reprimanded

30:55.806 --> 30:58.151
on several additional
offences, haven't you?

30:58.157 --> 31:00.930
Objection. This witness'
misdemeanours are irrelevant.

31:00.936 --> 31:04.759
Ah, one, in particular, I believe is
crucial to the question of credibility.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.939
I'll allow it for now.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.956
According to your prison file

31:08.962 --> 31:12.232
you've been found intoxicated on
several occasions, is that right?

31:13.083 --> 31:14.552
Answer the question.

31:14.558 --> 31:16.936
- Yes, but not for ages...
- In fact, you've embarked

31:16.942 --> 31:20.297
on several alcohol rehabilitation
programs haven't you?

31:20.303 --> 31:23.846
- Y-yes.
- Five different programs.

31:24.085 --> 31:26.654
And how many have you
successfully completed?

31:27.084 --> 31:28.343
None, but I'm...

31:28.349 --> 31:30.279
- I'm not alcoholic anymore.
- Were you under the influence of

31:30.285 --> 31:32.101
alcohol at the time of this alleged

31:32.107 --> 31:33.993
- conversation with Ms Stevens?
- No.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.349
Were you under the influence of alcohol

31:35.355 --> 31:37.254
- when you made the statement to police?
- No.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.951
Are you under the
influence of alcohol now?

31:38.957 --> 31:40.261
- No.
- Objection.

31:40.267 --> 31:42.090
That's enough, Mr Baresic.

31:43.405 --> 31:45.665
Let's recap some of your testimony.

31:46.044 --> 31:48.571
You claimed that the defendant

31:48.577 --> 31:52.163
murdered Helen Masters,
dragged her body to the garage,

31:52.169 --> 31:54.068
shaved her head, put her in the car,

31:54.074 --> 31:56.782
drove to Sassafras and buried the body.

31:56.788 --> 31:59.018
- Is that an accurate summation?
- Yes.

31:59.024 --> 32:00.711
That was the sequence of events,

32:00.717 --> 32:03.219
- as relayed to you by Ms Stevens?
- Yes.

32:03.225 --> 32:05.043
Could you explain to the court

32:05.049 --> 32:06.791
how the defendant was
able to move a body

32:06.797 --> 32:09.427
that weighted nearly 20
kilos more than her own.

32:09.892 --> 32:12.002
I suppose she just dragged her. Hm.

32:12.008 --> 32:13.208
You suppose?

32:13.214 --> 32:15.001
Well, I mean, it's...
it's only a short distance

32:15.007 --> 32:16.266
- to the garage.
- Have you ever been to

32:16.272 --> 32:17.811
- Ms Stevens' home?
- No.

32:17.817 --> 32:21.059
So, the short distance to the garage
is just your assumption, isn't it?

32:21.324 --> 32:22.991
- Yes.
- As is the supposition

32:22.997 --> 32:24.966
that she dragged the body.
She never actually specified

32:24.972 --> 32:26.955
- that detail, did she?
- Well, no.

32:26.961 --> 32:28.753
So, what else in your
statement is an assumption?

32:28.759 --> 32:30.279
- Nothing.
- Time of death?

32:30.285 --> 32:31.865
No, she said 1:00 PM.

32:31.871 --> 32:33.576
1:00 PM, after lunch.

32:33.582 --> 32:35.689
- Those were your words, correct?
- Yes.

32:35.695 --> 32:38.749
Would it surprise you to hear that
the victim's autopsy report states

32:38.755 --> 32:40.608
that she hadn't eaten
prior to her death?

32:41.082 --> 32:42.795
So, is the time of death

32:42.801 --> 32:44.600
- yet another assumption?
- No.

32:44.606 --> 32:46.093
What about the head shaving?

32:47.079 --> 32:50.979
You claimed that the
defendant shaved Helen's head

32:50.985 --> 32:53.389
in the garage, post-murder. Correct?

32:53.395 --> 32:56.196
- Yes.
- That is what Ms Stevens told you

32:56.202 --> 32:58.167
- in the exercise yard?
- Yes.

32:59.552 --> 33:02.913
I would like to show
the witness Exhibit 7A.

33:10.918 --> 33:12.765
Please describe the photograph.

33:14.435 --> 33:17.614
It... it's a photo of,
uh, Sonia and Helen.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.916
Hmm, and what do you notice
about Helen's appearance?

33:21.338 --> 33:22.826
Her head is shaved.

33:23.316 --> 33:24.516
And...?

33:25.839 --> 33:28.349
- I dunno.
- Well, she's very much alive.

33:28.355 --> 33:29.857
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Yes.

33:29.863 --> 33:31.755
In fact, they're laughing
together aren't they?

33:31.761 --> 33:33.131
- Yes.
- Which makes a mockery

33:33.137 --> 33:34.337
of your testimony.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.290
In fact, this photograph

33:36.296 --> 33:39.030
support the defendant's
version of events,

33:39.036 --> 33:42.466
that the defendant shaved
Helen's head at Helen's request.

33:42.472 --> 33:44.349
Helen wanted to surprise her sister,

33:44.355 --> 33:47.091
who was undergoing
chemotherapy at the time.

33:47.097 --> 33:50.343
So, time of death... wrong.

33:50.349 --> 33:52.177
Sequence of events... wrong.

33:52.183 --> 33:54.402
Assumptions replacing facts... wrong.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.129
They're laughing together
aren't they? Yeah, wrong.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.150
Your assumption, yeah,
wrong. Helen was... wrong.

33:58.156 --> 33:59.962
Helen was... wrong.
Your assumption... wrong.

33:59.968 --> 34:01.390
I put it to you that your

34:01.396 --> 34:03.957
entire statement is a work of fiction!

34:05.169 --> 34:07.437
Isn't it true that your
reward for making the statement

34:07.443 --> 34:09.271
- was an early release?
- Yes.

34:09.277 --> 34:12.346
Isn't it true that this conversation
with Ms Steven never happened?!

34:12.351 --> 34:14.725
Isn't it true that you
have lied under oath

34:14.731 --> 34:18.568
and deceived this court
for your own personal gain?!

34:19.846 --> 34:21.635
Answer the question!

34:21.719 --> 34:22.967
Yes.

34:26.460 --> 34:27.949
Okay, I lied.

34:30.757 --> 34:32.077
Why did you lie?

34:32.083 --> 34:33.706
Were you coerced into this?

34:41.137 --> 34:42.337
No.

34:42.422 --> 34:43.963
No, it was me.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.130
It was my idea.

34:50.311 --> 34:51.726
It was all me.

34:52.139 --> 34:53.553
It was all me.

34:54.530 --> 34:56.029
It was all me.

34:56.496 --> 34:58.288
Nothing further, Your Honour.

35:05.979 --> 35:07.179
Oh, God.

35:09.760 --> 35:11.831
I don't... I don't know what happened.

35:11.837 --> 35:14.839
I, uh... I couldn't think and then my...

35:14.845 --> 35:16.656
- Shhh.
- I'm sorry, my brain...

35:16.662 --> 35:20.666
my brain just froze.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:20.803 --> 35:23.233
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

35:24.030 --> 35:25.575
It's not your fault, Liz.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.265
It's my fault.

35:29.344 --> 35:33.732
Where the... where the fuck
did that photo come from?!

35:33.738 --> 35:36.607
They found Helen's phone
in Sassafras last night.

35:36.724 --> 35:38.043
The defence got hold of it

35:38.049 --> 35:39.954
and they introduced it
into evidence this morning.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.098
Well, why the fuck didn't they tell us?!

35:42.335 --> 35:44.815
The Prosecutor rang me,
they left a message and I...

35:44.821 --> 35:46.888
didn't check my voice-mail. I...

35:47.177 --> 35:49.008
You... you...

35:49.311 --> 35:51.638
didn't check your fuckin' messages?

35:52.616 --> 35:56.562
You just sold me up shit creek!

35:56.568 --> 35:58.642
I'm so sorry, Liz. I'm...

35:58.871 --> 36:00.277
I just need a bit of time

36:00.283 --> 36:02.353
- and I'm going to fix this.
- How?!

36:02.359 --> 36:05.686
The barristers are in
with the judge now, okay.

36:06.163 --> 36:07.841
I'll keep you posted.

36:07.847 --> 36:09.685
I'm never gonna get out now, am I?

36:09.691 --> 36:13.599
Let's just wait and see what the
judge says, okay? Just get some rest.

36:13.605 --> 36:16.786
I'm gonna be back in touch
as soon as I can, all right?

36:35.153 --> 36:36.653
What the fuck do you want?!

36:37.840 --> 36:40.448
I need to speak to the Top Dog.

36:40.454 --> 36:43.341
- No, you're invisible, eh? Ooh...
- Uh, ooh, oh, there I am.

36:43.347 --> 36:45.353
So, I'm not, may I please?

36:46.114 --> 36:47.731
This is important.

36:47.737 --> 36:48.937
Oi?

36:57.375 --> 36:58.575
Hello.

37:00.699 --> 37:03.833
Tina Mercado is bringing in drugs
through the vegetable deliveries.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.470
Take it or leave it.

37:10.150 --> 37:11.475
Booms?

37:11.830 --> 37:13.030
What?

37:13.103 --> 37:14.628
You still want somethin' to do?

37:18.502 --> 37:19.915
Get the fuck out!

37:20.095 --> 37:21.295
Hey?!

37:21.641 --> 37:22.852
What the fuck are you doing?

37:22.858 --> 37:24.717
- Get out of the fucking...
- Shut your fuckin' potty mouth

37:24.723 --> 37:26.649
- before I put a fist in it!
- Argh!

37:28.154 --> 37:29.854
Hey! We had a deal.

37:30.038 --> 37:31.751
- Ugh!
- Boomer, no!

37:31.843 --> 37:33.578
- What?
- You know the rules.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.219
- Just hold her there.
- Yeah, all right. Sorry.

37:36.225 --> 37:37.568
- Uh...
- Sorry.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.412
- Not sorry!
- Ugh!

37:45.665 --> 37:47.282
Ugh! Oi!

37:47.477 --> 37:50.192
Not that... no... no! No!

37:50.282 --> 37:51.784
- Proctor!
- Ugh!

37:52.095 --> 37:53.295
Ugh!

37:54.571 --> 37:55.771
Ugh!

37:57.251 --> 37:58.694
I gave you a chance.

38:00.251 --> 38:02.481
Ugh! Uh, uh, fuck!

38:03.141 --> 38:04.999
- Ugh!
- You should have fuckin' listened!

38:05.617 --> 38:08.055
- Fuckin' listened!
- Fuck! Fuck!

38:08.133 --> 38:09.860
- Booms!
- Yeah.

38:10.430 --> 38:11.630
Fuck!

38:12.235 --> 38:14.830
Attention, compound.
Attention, compound.

38:14.836 --> 38:17.475
Phones are now available for use.

38:17.779 --> 38:19.159
Heard about Proctor.

38:19.165 --> 38:21.806
- Sounds like you need a Plan B.
- Get out of my face!

38:21.812 --> 38:23.061
I know every inch of this prison.

38:23.067 --> 38:25.881
I am deeply familiar with it's
security procedure with every floor.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.087
I can help you.

38:30.779 --> 38:31.979
Why?

38:34.671 --> 38:36.957
It would serve a higher purpose.

38:37.605 --> 38:39.066
You talk a lot of shit.

38:39.072 --> 38:42.197
This offer expires very soon.
You know where to find me.

38:55.681 --> 38:57.302
Hey, you seen Kaz?

38:57.700 --> 38:59.590
- Nuh.
- Oh.

39:01.629 --> 39:03.082
You all right?

39:03.310 --> 39:05.148
You still worried about that Shayne kid?

39:05.870 --> 39:07.836
What time is he heading
to the police station?

39:07.842 --> 39:09.759
Fuck you ask a lot of questions.

39:09.964 --> 39:11.164
Do I?

39:11.270 --> 39:12.470
That's another one.

39:12.476 --> 39:13.676
Oh, sorry!

39:14.245 --> 39:15.445
5:30.

39:15.784 --> 39:17.285
Oh, in ten minutes.

39:17.291 --> 39:18.773
Can I make you a cuppa tea or something?

39:18.779 --> 39:20.900
- Mail for you Jackson...
- Sorry, that was another question.

39:20.906 --> 39:22.350
- Dickson.
- Well, go on then.

39:22.356 --> 39:24.793
Well, how do you take it?
Oop, that was another one.

39:24.799 --> 39:27.413
Black with three, smart-arse.

39:27.419 --> 39:29.444
Doyle. Mail for ya.

39:41.738 --> 39:42.938
What's that?

39:42.944 --> 39:44.383
It's my necklace.

39:46.042 --> 39:48.364
I only ever told Mike Pennisi about it.

39:49.152 --> 39:51.260
This must be from someone he told.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.246
God... Ferguson didn't kill him.

39:54.591 --> 39:56.090
What? Who did then?

39:56.096 --> 39:58.482
I must have been
someone he was close to.

40:00.895 --> 40:02.734
Fuck, Shayne's gone to the cops!

40:04.997 --> 40:06.721
Doyle, slow down!

40:27.909 --> 40:30.525
Hey! Hey, it's urgent, can
I use the phone? I'll owe ya!

40:31.801 --> 40:33.001
Fuck!

40:46.863 --> 40:49.065
Hey, Shayne, it's me.
Don't go to the cops!

40:49.355 --> 40:50.660
Why, what's happened?

40:50.862 --> 40:52.882
Ah, I don't think it was Ferguson.

40:53.274 --> 40:54.474
W-what?!

40:54.480 --> 40:57.502
It was someone else.
Someone on the outside.

40:59.070 --> 41:01.069
Miss Bennett! I need to talk to ya.

41:01.163 --> 41:03.073
Doyle, I've looked into
Ferguson's phone calls,

41:03.079 --> 41:04.593
- there's nothing of note. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

41:04.599 --> 41:06.239
It's not Ferguson. I know that now.

41:06.245 --> 41:07.453
I got a letter

41:07.459 --> 41:10.135
and there was something in it
that I only told Pennisi about.

41:10.141 --> 41:11.638
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:11.644 --> 41:13.758
Pennisi had been stalkin' me for weeks.

41:13.764 --> 41:16.016
He must have followed me
when I dumped that gun.

41:16.022 --> 41:18.866
He picked it up, pretended to
run into me and then we talked.

41:18.872 --> 41:21.248
And he told the killer what I told him.

41:21.428 --> 41:23.742
- Doyle...?
- Don't you get it?

41:23.748 --> 41:25.142
He knew his killer.

41:26.244 --> 41:28.456
I don't know what you
expect me to do about it.

41:28.462 --> 41:30.056
That's a matter for your lawyers.

41:30.955 --> 41:34.688
In the meantime, I setup a counselling
session for you and Ms Westfall.

41:36.938 --> 41:38.169
Fuck!

41:39.559 --> 41:41.067
Oh, no luck?

41:41.073 --> 41:42.273
Nuh!

41:42.458 --> 41:44.486
I thought the answer
was in here but it's not.

41:44.492 --> 41:46.958
It's outside and there's
jack shit I can do about it.

41:58.629 --> 42:02.403
DPP are withdrawing the
charges. Sonia's being released.

42:05.910 --> 42:07.621
I'm so sorry, Liz.

42:07.718 --> 42:09.833
They're gonna charge you with perjury.

42:12.340 --> 42:13.540
Right.

42:14.752 --> 42:15.952
Okay.

42:16.731 --> 42:19.227
Which means what, exactly?

42:20.690 --> 42:24.089
It carries a maximum
sentence of 15 years.

42:26.709 --> 42:28.738
I promise you...

42:29.216 --> 42:30.714
I will fix this.

42:40.064 --> 42:41.334
Ah, rest assured,

42:41.340 --> 42:44.949
I will be seeking compensation
for my false imprisonment,

42:44.955 --> 42:48.479
but today, justice has been served.

43:31.288 --> 43:33.659
There's no escaping this place is there?

43:56.935 --> 43:59.442
Next Tuesday, 8:30.

43:59.926 --> 44:01.748
I know that you got something going on.

44:02.731 --> 44:04.347
I can tell it's something big.

44:05.333 --> 44:09.053
I've decided to keep
my distance from Franky.

44:09.512 --> 44:11.638
Bea brought us together for a reason.

44:15.627 --> 44:19.304
All prisoners out of their cells
standing by your doors, please.

44:19.310 --> 44:20.985
So, what's your game, Freak?

44:20.991 --> 44:22.972
We might be in here for
quite awhile together.

44:22.978 --> 44:24.788
Don't you think it's time
we buried the hatchet.

44:24.794 --> 44:26.034
What do you think you're doin'?

44:26.271 --> 44:28.053
You're all aware of the problem.

44:28.553 --> 44:30.459
I hold the solution.

44:31.358 --> 44:33.969
There is a catch.

44:34.256 --> 44:35.748
You are gonna get caught.

44:35.948 --> 44:41.145
Wentworth. Next Tuesday,
8:30, on ShowCase.
