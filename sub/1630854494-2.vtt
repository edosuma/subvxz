He even prepared the down payment to sign the contract this week.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.908
Oh, right. I forgot about the contract.

16:47.909 --> 16:49.579
It's not like I signed any contracts yet.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.048
I changed my mind. What's he going to do about it?

16:52.049 --> 16:54.619
He has a point. You need a contract for it to be legally binding.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.119
Come on, Mr. Kwak!

16:56.120 --> 16:58.690
You know what? After listening to him,

16:58.919 --> 17:01.529
I realized it would be a huge loss if I sold it for that price.

17:02.559 --> 17:06.499
Dad, it's been years since anyone rented that building.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.129
You know what? You should go and check it out with Mr. Kwak.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.368
Go where?

17:11.369 --> 17:13.470
Go and sign the contract at the billiard hall.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.348
You told me we could come here and measure the place.

But you've been showing this building? Seriously.

17:57.650 --> 18:01.149
No. That's not true. I just found out too.

18:01.150 --> 18:02.848
Let's talk about this outside.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.588
Talk about what? We can do it here.

18:04.589 --> 18:06.288
Well, I have a client here.

18:13.329 --> 18:16.298
- Let go of me. - No. I just found out too.

18:16.299 --> 18:19.169
- Hey! Are you serious right now? - Come on.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.299
Are you all right?

18:21.410 --> 18:22.640
You must have been quite startled.

18:23.569 --> 18:26.339
Since all the lights are out, let's go to the window.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.279
Gosh. Why is she screaming like that?

18:29.450 --> 18:32.179
- Come here. - Hey, stop pushing me!

18:32.180 --> 18:33.679
You need to watch your steps!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.450
I can walk just fine. Don't push me.

18:35.849 --> 18:39.358
Hey, who's that woman? What do you mean, "client?"

18:39.359 --> 18:42.288
What? Is your dad going to sell it to her to make...

18:42.289 --> 18:43.660
a bit more money off this?

18:44.289 --> 18:47.298
Listen. She came here to rent this place.

18:47.299 --> 18:49.669
Do you think she'll rent this? Don't worry about it.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.670
But why did you show this building without our permission?

18:53.769 --> 18:56.139
Hey, do you think that makes any sense?

18:56.140 --> 18:57.508
Hey, I didn't bring her here.

18:57.509 --> 18:59.339
And I'm not planning to look for a tenant either.

18:59.579 --> 19:02.180
It was all my father's and Mr. Kwak's idea.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.979
- I told you. - What's he talking about?

19:04.980 --> 19:07.420
- Gosh. - I won't let my father do this.

19:07.650 --> 19:10.318
Chang Soo, take her back to your store.

19:10.319 --> 19:13.159
I'll take care of this and head over there.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.129
Gosh, Sung Min. Don't mess this up. Okay?

19:16.130 --> 19:18.528
Of course. Don't you know who I am? I'm good at what I do.

19:18.529 --> 19:20.199
- Okay. - You're cracking me up.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.329
Let's go. You should go back inside too.

19:22.769 --> 19:25.098
- That little... - Come on!

19:25.099 --> 19:27.039
- You can't break that! - Okay.

19:28.069 --> 19:31.538
Did I do something wrong?

19:31.539 --> 19:33.910
Gosh, no. Not at all.

19:33.940 --> 19:36.409
There was a misunderstanding.

19:36.410 --> 19:39.180
You don't have to worry about them. Don't mind them.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.789
Mr. Kwak!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.758
Mr. Kwak. What did you tell my dad?

19:44.759 --> 19:46.758
How did you get him to change his mind?

19:46.759 --> 19:49.989
Well, come on. Don't be so rude. We have a client here.

19:49.990 --> 19:52.730
This is the son of the building owner.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.269
- You... - Discount Store?

19:55.700 --> 19:58.639
Look. I used to be an athlete.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.470
So I hate beating around the bush.

20:01.609 --> 20:04.778
All right. So do you even know where you're moving into?

20:04.779 --> 20:06.380
- Be quiet. Hey. - Do you?

20:06.579 --> 20:08.679
It's been 20 years since this place has been vacant.

20:08.680 --> 20:09.880
Why do you think so?

20:10.450 --> 20:11.619
Twenty years?

20:11.819 --> 20:14.149
Stop it. Are you seriously doing this right now?

20:14.150 --> 20:16.950
I already talked to your father. He's on board with this.

20:17.089 --> 20:19.818
- You said she was the tenant. - What's this about?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.259
It's nothing.

20:21.660 --> 20:23.029
Nothing, my foot.

20:24.059 --> 20:26.858
- Someone died in here. - What?

20:26.859 --> 20:29.499
Can you live in a building where someone died? I can't!

20:29.500 --> 20:30.970
Are you seriously doing this?

20:31.500 --> 20:35.139
Well, this is your decision to make.

20:35.140 --> 20:37.440
But nothing happened after that.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.740
Mr. Kwak.

20:39.710 --> 20:43.348
Just look at her face. She's terrified.

20:43.349 --> 20:45.848
You know what? Let's not do this in this dark building.

20:45.849 --> 20:47.848
Let's talk about it outside. Okay? There might be ghosts in here.

20:47.849 --> 20:49.318
- Come on. - Okay?

20:49.319 --> 20:51.919
If you keep this up, I'll talk to your father about this!

20:51.920 --> 20:53.719
Go ahead. Do it.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.389
You know what? I'll be honest. I can't believe this.

20:56.390 --> 20:58.258
Why did you bring her here?

20:58.259 --> 20:59.598
There are other perfectly liveable houses.

20:59.599 --> 21:01.569
- Are you trying to scam her? - Miss.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.200
Fifty dollars.

21:03.769 --> 21:04.839
- What? - What?

21:05.339 --> 21:07.769
The monthly rent here is 50 dollars.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.308
- What did you say? - Fifty dollars?

21:10.309 --> 21:13.338
I wouldn't have brought you here unless this place had an upside.

21:13.339 --> 21:15.750
Mr. Kwak. Are you serious?

21:15.880 --> 21:18.679
I got the owner of this building...

21:18.680 --> 21:21.149
to rent this place to you for 50 dollars.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.190
And in exchange for your work to maintain this place.

21:23.420 --> 21:25.858
My father agreed to 50 dollars for the monthly rent?

21:25.859 --> 21:26.890
Yes!

21:27.559 --> 21:29.129
- Yes! - Okay. I'll call him.

21:29.130 --> 21:30.489
You. Be smart about this.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.599
Fifty dollars.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.829
To stay here for a year,

21:34.900 --> 21:36.569
it would cost 600 dollars.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.670
So what's it going to be?

21:42.069 --> 21:44.569
Then I'll take this place.

21:44.880 --> 21:45.979
What?

21:45.980 --> 21:48.078
- Yes. Excellent! - Dad.

21:48.079 --> 21:50.749
- Hello? Dad. - You know what? Let me pray...

21:50.750 --> 21:52.219
- I'm at the building. - for your good fortune.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.719
- The rent is 50 dollars? - Father.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.919
- She will settle down here. - What?

21:56.920 --> 21:59.588
- Bless with your love and glory. - Come on, Dad!

21:59.589 --> 22:01.389
- Dad! - Amen.

22:01.390 --> 22:02.960
Come on. This is nuts!

22:03.289 --> 22:05.299
Let's go, Sung Min.

22:06.230 --> 22:08.130
Hold on a second.

22:08.230 --> 22:10.598
- Did you even try using the toilet? - Go away.

22:10.599 --> 22:12.399
Even if you take a dump here, it won't flush.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.599
You can't take a shower here.

22:14.170 --> 22:16.308
How are you going to live in a place like this?

22:16.309 --> 22:18.308
You really should reconsider!

22:18.309 --> 22:21.750
(Bae Young Ho, Lee Yeo Reum)

22:22.849 --> 22:24.720
I'm glad you like the place.

22:24.950 --> 22:27.149
- Thanks. - Ma'am.

22:27.150 --> 22:29.989
All right. You can wire the annual rent, 600 dollars now.

22:29.990 --> 22:31.049
Okay.

22:34.829 --> 22:37.259
- I just wired it to you. - Check it.

22:41.130 --> 22:42.400
What about your commission?

22:42.500 --> 22:44.529
Gosh, don't mention it. It's all right.

22:45.869 --> 22:47.569
Just live a good life there.

22:47.740 --> 22:49.269
- Thank you. - Here.

22:52.180 --> 22:56.809
By the way, can I move in tonight?

22:57.309 --> 22:58.480
Tonight?

22:59.480 --> 23:01.649
But there's no electricity. Nothing works in the building.

23:01.650 --> 23:02.650
It's okay.

23:03.890 --> 23:06.119
Well, your lease does start today.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.589
You're ridiculous. Gosh.

23:09.690 --> 23:11.730
- Come on. - Sung Min.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.230
Give her the key.

23:19.670 --> 23:21.440
Here you go. Okay?

23:21.769 --> 23:24.608
Honey, remember what I asked? Bring that now.

23:24.609 --> 23:25.940
Okay.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.278
The lights don't work in the building.

23:29.279 --> 23:30.979
Gosh, thank you.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.980
- Live a good life there. - Okay.

23:33.779 --> 23:36.118
- That punk. Okay. - Bye.

23:36.119 --> 23:38.259
- Bye. - Bye.

23:43.190 --> 23:44.259
Well,

23:45.400 --> 23:49.329
thank you for telling me what happened in the building.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.900
If I had found out later, it would have been scarier.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.710
Whatever.

23:58.009 --> 24:01.480
If things break down there, you can fix it yourself.

24:02.009 --> 24:05.519
If you can't live there anymore, don't hesitate to leave. Okay?

24:06.950 --> 24:07.980
Okay.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.829
I have a home now.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.720
After quitting my job in that split second,

25:20.690 --> 25:23.589
I just stayed in bed for two days.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.700
I was scared.

25:28.130 --> 25:32.200
I couldn't think of what to do. Nothing came to my mind.

25:38.539 --> 25:41.180
I decided to leave Seoul first.

25:42.380 --> 25:45.680
Staying in a place like this without a job would be too much.

26:00.529 --> 26:02.669
I didn't have the heart to throw out Jae Dong's things before.

26:02.670 --> 26:04.829
But I finally got rid of them.

26:09.539 --> 26:12.579
And as for my stuff,

26:12.880 --> 26:15.480
I decided to only keep things that would fit into one backpack.

26:18.250 --> 26:20.518
While going through my stuff,

26:20.519 --> 26:22.089
I realized I had bought so many things.

26:22.589 --> 26:25.259
The tea mugs I collected just because they looked cute.

26:26.059 --> 26:28.759
The plates I've only used once for my housewarming party.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.769
The clothes I had bought but didn't even know I had.

26:36.869 --> 26:39.970
The cheap shoes I habitually bought at the shops by the bus terminal.

26:41.940 --> 26:45.809
From each category, I only picked one item I absolutely needed.

26:46.710 --> 26:48.139
It was even more competitive...

26:48.140 --> 26:49.950
than the interviews to join those top companies.

26:51.509 --> 26:54.990
I listed the things I didn't need online, and they sold right away.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.190
Goodbye,

27:03.029 --> 27:04.660

27:13.599 --> 27:15.440
Before this trip is over,

27:16.710 --> 27:18.140
I want to find the answer.

27:20.509 --> 27:21.750
On how...

27:22.309 --> 27:24.109

Hello.

How may I help you?

28:26.910 --> 28:30.410
What can I do to get a membership card for this library?

28:31.950 --> 28:34.649
To do that, you need an address in this area.

28:34.650 --> 28:35.950
Yes, I have one.

28:36.150 --> 28:38.319
- Oh, did you recently move here? - Yes.

28:38.859 --> 28:40.059

Oh, and thank you for the map.

- Excuse me. - Your bag is over there.

30:40.440 --> 30:41.779
It's not about that.

30:45.779 --> 30:49.490
Hey, this is my spot. Don't sit here from now on.

30:50.319 --> 30:52.920
Kim Bom, be quiet.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.329
Why does she only tell me to be quiet?

Wait.

Hello?

31:25.490 --> 31:28.559

Come downstairs, and you'll see.

33:57.539 --> 33:58.608
I'll do whatever I want.

33:58.609 --> 34:00.740
- Isn't the meat so good today? - Excuse me.

34:00.839 --> 34:03.349
- The meat is to die for. - What else would you like?

34:03.549 --> 34:04.650
Ma'am.

34:05.980 --> 34:07.980
I'd like a bottle of soju.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.250
I told you. Don't do that.

34:10.489 --> 34:12.018
Okay, I heard you.

34:12.019 --> 34:13.959
It's not even a big deal.

34:13.960 --> 34:16.788
- But that guy said... - No.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.389
All right, sure.

34:25.070 --> 34:26.070
This is nice.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.539
Hot, cold, hot, cold.

34:28.969 --> 34:30.610
Who came up with this?

34:42.190 --> 34:44.589
Let's just do that for today.

34:44.590 --> 34:47.089
- Why make such a fuss? - Why don't you help him a little?

34:47.090 --> 34:48.859
Well, I was just...

34:48.860 --> 34:50.860
The same goes for you. About that thing...

34:52.090 --> 34:54.229
Oh, that? But if you're too busy...

34:54.230 --> 34:56.569
- They said they'd take care of it. - I see.

34:56.570 --> 34:59.368
No, they said they didn't have time.

34:59.369 --> 35:03.340
- Really? Okay. - You need to get that sorted out.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.280
I know. I'm trying.

35:14.119 --> 35:15.179
The taste of true adulthood.

35:20.690 --> 35:23.230
- Thank you for the food! - That was great!

35:23.289 --> 35:26.460
Thanks for coming. I'll put it on your tab! Bye!

35:28.099 --> 35:29.300
All right.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.440
(Soju)

35:41.179 --> 35:43.579
I can't believe they didn't finish their fish cake.

35:50.590 --> 35:51.789
She's really something.

(Angok Public Library)

36:54.079 --> 36:55.920
Why am I here?

36:59.360 --> 37:01.460
- Bye. - Bye!

37:01.889 --> 37:03.960
- Thank you for the delicious food! - Thank you.

37:04.530 --> 37:08.658
(10 hours ago)

37:08.659 --> 37:11.230
Goodness. That young lady got drunk in broad daylight.

37:13.539 --> 37:16.639
(Restaurant)

37:17.909 --> 37:19.039
Hey, get the ball!

37:21.409 --> 37:23.679
- Hey! - No!

37:26.750 --> 37:28.779
- Dae Bum, let's do it again. - Wait.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.288
- Where are you going? - Dae Bum.

37:30.289 --> 37:33.619
- Hey. - What are you doing?

37:33.760 --> 37:34.960
Hey, wait!

38:05.219 --> 38:08.018
- Hey, look at her. - Hey, look!

38:08.019 --> 38:10.360
- She's so drunk! - Shall I mimic her?

38:11.460 --> 38:13.928
- Hey, look at her face. - Guys, let's play!

38:13.929 --> 38:15.698
- Let's play! - Hey!

38:15.699 --> 38:17.229
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

38:17.230 --> 38:18.530
Boys, keep it down!

38:19.099 --> 38:20.669
Catch me if you can!

38:20.670 --> 38:22.569
There, I caught you!

38:22.570 --> 38:25.539
- I caught you? - What? What is this?

38:25.840 --> 38:26.979
Is she drunk?

38:26.980 --> 38:29.909
- Oh, look! - Hey, she passed out.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.448
- What is this? - Hey.

38:33.449 --> 38:36.049
- Look at her hair! - It looks like a snake.

38:36.050 --> 38:37.689
Yes!

38:37.690 --> 38:40.090
Excuse me. What are you doing?

38:40.619 --> 38:43.288
- It's Medusa, not a snake. - Right, Medusa!

38:43.289 --> 38:45.488
- Hey, these days... - She must be out of her mind.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.598
Well, maybe she really is out of her mind.

38:47.599 --> 38:49.299
Oh, I'm at the library.

38:49.300 --> 38:50.629
My gosh. What's with her?

38:50.630 --> 38:52.939
- Hey, look. - Why did she come to the library?

38:52.940 --> 38:54.599
Gosh, I should go home.

38:55.710 --> 38:57.940
- Can't you keep your eyes open? - Kids, move aside.

38:58.239 --> 39:00.409
You can't come here drunk.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.750
- I'm sorry. - Okay!

39:05.380 --> 39:07.980
- Let's play! - Stop, kids. Let go.

39:10.889 --> 39:12.689
Hey, not there!

39:12.690 --> 39:14.788
- We'll play here! - No, not there!

39:14.789 --> 39:15.960
Hey, Dae Bum!

39:16.230 --> 39:18.059
I have to go home.

39:19.429 --> 39:21.099
I have to go home...

39:24.599 --> 39:25.900
Gosh, this is crazy.

39:26.369 --> 39:28.769
I need to go home.

39:31.969 --> 39:33.010
What's this?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.150
Gosh, why did I drink?

39:42.889 --> 39:43.889
It's 3am?

39:52.860 --> 39:53.900
Hello?

39:55.869 --> 39:58.599
I'm locked in here! Let me out!

39:58.900 --> 40:00.969
Hello? What should I do?

40:03.739 --> 40:04.769
My phone.

40:14.679 --> 40:15.719
Stay away.

40:16.090 --> 40:18.219
Don't come close. Stop!

40:18.349 --> 40:19.590
Stop!

40:25.190 --> 40:26.230
You're that librarian.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.239
Thank you.

40:50.650 --> 40:54.519
By the way, why are you still here?

40:57.329 --> 40:58.630
Is it because of me?

41:00.530 --> 41:01.599
I'm sorry.

41:09.570 --> 41:11.710
You woke up.

41:12.210 --> 41:14.609
We have to wait until 8am tomorrow...

41:14.610 --> 41:17.579
to use the electricity and open the door.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.780
So make yourself at home and get some rest until then.

41:22.820 --> 41:25.690
Oh, he can't speak.

41:27.860 --> 41:32.030
But why didn't you wake me up?

41:36.429 --> 41:39.670
Dae Bum, I'm off. Tidy up and get going, okay?

41:40.239 --> 41:41.239
Bye!

(7 hours ago)

41:44.340 --> 41:45.769
Thank you. I'm off!

42:56.750 --> 42:59.210
Oh, you probably tried to wake me up but couldn't.

43:01.420 --> 43:02.619
You should get some sleep.

43:24.369 --> 43:26.709
If you want to read some books,

43:26.710 --> 43:29.480
go to the far-right corner by the window.

It's the brightest spot.

43:34.050 --> 43:35.480
Thank you.

43:53.300 --> 43:54.340
This...

44:00.280 --> 44:01.340
Excuse me.

44:03.179 --> 44:04.280
Are you here?

44:10.289 --> 44:12.519
Oh, there you are.

44:14.690 --> 44:15.789
Hey.

44:17.329 --> 44:19.329
You can stop.

44:24.170 --> 44:26.639
I just wanted to return this to you.

44:31.139 --> 44:33.039
That's why I came here, but...

44:37.250 --> 44:41.349
Then I'll just use this and return it to you in the morning.

44:46.219 --> 44:47.519
Good night.

44:51.460 --> 44:52.489
Actually...

44:54.130 --> 44:56.900
Could I use the restroom?

45:07.610 --> 45:10.409
The restroom is outside.

45:12.610 --> 45:16.349
What? If the restroom is outside, why did he give me water to drink?

45:17.949 --> 45:19.789
He gave me the water but didn't even have a sip himself.

45:20.690 --> 45:23.059
No, just shake it off.

45:23.489 --> 45:25.730
I should stop thinking that I need to use the restroom.

46:02.530 --> 46:03.730
It's almost morning.

46:05.030 --> 46:06.340
Almost...

46:08.800 --> 46:09.940
Hang in there.

46:15.510 --> 46:16.750
Just a little longer...

46:20.079 --> 46:21.119
Please...

46:33.260 --> 46:35.530
If I let my guard down at the end, it's game over.

46:36.199 --> 46:37.670
I definitely should not run.

46:38.300 --> 46:40.369
Once it starts coming out, it can't be stopped.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.719
Take care.

- What is that? - Wait.

What are they doing?

Your bag.

Dae Bum, what was that about? Hey!

49:05.809 --> 49:10.320
How much did she drink that she fell asleep at the library?

49:11.320 --> 49:12.749
You're weird too.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.989
You could've just gone home. Why did you stay here all night too?

49:16.159 --> 49:18.059
You can't even talk in front of strangers.

49:20.760 --> 49:21.829
Hey.

49:22.829 --> 49:24.900
Go home and wash up. Take this home too.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.039
My mom made ginseng tea and a bunch of other things for you.

Call her. She's upset because you haven't called her.

Give her my thanks.

- Okay. - Don't forget!

49:42.280 --> 49:43.420
Okay, I will.

49:48.190 --> 49:49.219
Did he hear it?

49:51.090 --> 49:52.159
He must have, right?

49:52.929 --> 49:54.699
Of course, he heard it.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.698
I'm so embarrassed.
