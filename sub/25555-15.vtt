06:38.765 --> 06:40.433
Get your mother(bleep)
under control.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.101
{\an5}(Kirk)
No, it's not--
No, it's not her.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.337
{\an5}He needs to be gone
because I'm tired
of this (bleep).

06:44.403 --> 06:46.172
{\an1}Don't talk.
Don't do that.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.807
{\an4}(Codi)
Yeah, don't
do that, Candace.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.109
{\an5}I'm tired of it.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.109
{\an4}(Kirk)
It had nothing to do
with her at all.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.012
{\an1}I don't want my night
ruined because of her dude.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.414
I understand Kirk is trying
to calm me down right now.

06:55.481 --> 06:57.884
But at this point, I'm going
through things with Gator.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.285
I mean, I told my mama
the whole story.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.454
You grabbed my face.
You grabbed my throat, whatever.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.224
{\an8}(disconnect tone)

07:05.291 --> 07:08.461
And the one night that
I needed to be away

07:08.528 --> 07:10.129
and get my mind
off things with Gator,

07:10.196 --> 07:11.764
we get kicked out of No Name.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.432
So... my night
has been ruined.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.401
(ringing)

07:15.468 --> 07:17.103
{\an7}(Sharon)
<i>Hey, baby, how are you doing?</i>

07:17.170 --> 07:18.805
{\an7}Logan showed up
at No Name,

07:18.871 --> 07:20.473
{\an7}and I threw my drink
in his face.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.677
{\an1}And then... Gus and Codi
ended up whoopin' his ass.

07:24.744 --> 07:25.878
{\an5}Whatever, whatever.

07:24.744 --> 07:25.878
(kisses)

07:25.945 --> 07:27.647
{\an1}But I'm just, like,
tired of him showing up.

07:27.713 --> 07:28.815
Like, I'm (bleep) done.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.184
I'm exhausted.
All I can do is vent

07:31.250 --> 07:33.486
in hopes that my mom
can make me feel better.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.022
<i>Um, he called me</i>
<i>and threatened me.</i>

07:36.088 --> 07:38.324
<i>And he said</i>
<i>"F me."</i>

07:38.391 --> 07:39.826
<i>And called me</i>
<i>a (bleep).</i>

07:39.892 --> 07:43.462
{\an1}<i>And he said, "You tell Kortni</i>
<i>and her friends</i>

07:43.529 --> 07:46.799
<i>they better not go out</i>
<i>to the bar again."</i>

07:46.866 --> 07:50.102
This is a little deeper than
any of the roommates may think.

07:50.169 --> 07:53.272
My safety is at risk
and so are other people's.

07:53.339 --> 07:54.874
I'm so proud of you.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.442
{\an5}I'm so proud of you.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.442
You know what? Uhn!

07:56.509 --> 07:58.144
{\an1}Yes!

07:58.211 --> 08:00.079
{\an4}We might sleep together
and have some babies tonight.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.079
{\an3}No. No. No.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.480
(Gus laughing)

08:01.547 --> 08:03.883
I think it needs to be taken
a little more seriously.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.653
{\an1}I'm tired of this, and it's
gonna keep (bleep) happening.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.989
Like, I literally can't
go out for five minutes?

08:10.056 --> 08:11.724
{\an1}I can't go out
for five minutes

08:11.791 --> 08:13.893
{\an1}without him showing
the hell up.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.030
{\an7}And he showed up
at No Name.

08:18.097 --> 08:20.066
{\an7}I didn't know that
he was, like, crazy.

08:20.132 --> 08:22.268
{\an8}Uh, Logan Fairbanks.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.904
{\an9}(laughs)

08:22.335 --> 08:24.904
{\an8}Yeah. Yeah.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.039

08:27.106 --> 08:29.008
{\an8}(Gus)
Here comes freakin' Logan.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.514
{\an1}(Kortni)
I'm tired of this.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.183
And it's gonna keep
(bleep) happening.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.318
{\an1}Like, I literally
can't go out for five minutes

08:39.385 --> 08:41.721
{\an1}without him showing
the hell up.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.688
{\an1}Can you, like,
come here tomorrow?

08:43.756 --> 08:46.359
{\an1}Please?

08:46.425 --> 08:47.493
(Sharon)
<i>Yeah, I can.</i>

08:47.560 --> 08:49.328
{\an5}<i>Love you.</i>

08:47.560 --> 08:49.328
Love you, too.

08:49.395 --> 08:50.897
<i>Bye.</i>

08:52.498 --> 08:55.001
You okay, Jeremiah?
You still on edge?

08:55.067 --> 08:58.304
{\an1}Hey, real talk: He was saying
the wildest (bleep), bro.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.839
{\an1}(Gus)
The wildest (bleep).

08:59.906 --> 09:01.874
{\an1}(Aimee)
Why I think Logan stalks us

09:01.941 --> 09:05.044
{\an1}is because Kortni
has cut things off with him.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.345
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
That (bleep) is bull(bleep).

09:06.412 --> 09:08.981
It is not Kortni's fault.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.284
{\an1}That's been my whole
point the entire time.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.053
It was just weird to me
how he was targeting you.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.355
{\an6}You know?

09:14.120 --> 09:16.355
'Cause he did go straight
to you talking (bleep).

09:16.422 --> 09:18.391
Yeah, that's why
I was worried.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.593
{\an1}The only person he got in their
face to start with was you.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.295
He went straight
to you.

09:22.361 --> 09:25.498
{\an5}(Aimee)
I think Logan attacked Jeremiah
because Logan is noticing

09:25.564 --> 09:28.401
{\an8}Jeremiah and Kortni secretly
do like each other.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.536
{\an1}No one did anything
until he actually started

09:30.603 --> 09:32.238
{\an1}putting hands
on some of ours.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.272
{\an1}(Gus)
The dudes in this house,

09:33.339 --> 09:34.307
{\an1}we see eye to eye
on everything.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.308
{\an1}That's why
we click.

09:35.374 --> 09:36.642
We'll yell at each other

09:36.709 --> 09:39.912
and before we go to bed,
we dap it up and say

09:39.979 --> 09:41.480
charge of the game,
and we love you.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.249
Even if we agree
to disagree,

09:43.316 --> 09:45.151
I'm not gonna go to bed
mad at you.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.019
I'm not gonna go
to bed mad at you ever.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.387
You know what?
I'm proud of y'all.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.622
I'm proud of y'all
for handling it.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.023
I want it all to
be over with,

09:51.090 --> 09:53.159
I want Kortni to get
a restraining order on him.

09:53.225 --> 09:55.494
I don't want him to be able
to come back around us.

09:55.561 --> 09:57.830
Logan is such a barnacle.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.132
He follows us
everywhere we go.

10:00.199 --> 10:03.202
And maybe now, he won't
follow us anywhere else.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.105

{\an3}Yeah.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.277
{\an1}Gus was in the chair.
Gus and Codi were in the chair.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.578

He didn't even show
up to get a haircut.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.988
I'm looking over

15:23.055 --> 15:24.556
that Kortni's
keeping to herself.

15:24.623 --> 15:27.426
She's quiet.
She hasn't said anything about

15:27.493 --> 15:29.328
what has happened
at the barber shop.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.330
And honestly,
I feel bad for the girl

15:31.397 --> 15:33.899

harboring the blame for this

15:33.966 --> 15:35.434

no matter where we go,

15:45.210 --> 15:47.046

it's such a small town.

It's--

15:57.589 --> 15:59.391
The good thing
about being a local is, like,

15:59.458 --> 16:02.428
if you go into a bar,
and you tell the bouncers,

16:02.494 --> 16:05.731
"Hey, if he shows up, please,
let us know so we can leave."

16:05.798 --> 16:08.000
Or... "We can't
be around this guy,

16:08.067 --> 16:09.335
can you not let him in?"

16:18.711 --> 16:23.048

I am the one to blame for this

16:23.115 --> 16:25.250
because, yes,
I did date Logan.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.786
No, I didn't know that he was
going to act like this.

16:27.853 --> 16:29.888
He called my mom
and called her a (bleeps)

16:29.955 --> 16:31.757

16:36.028 --> 16:38.063
My mom has a text
of him saying

16:38.130 --> 16:39.565
that if we go somewhere,

16:39.631 --> 16:42.434
no matter where we go,
he's going to be there.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.104
He ain't gonna get to you,
that's for damn sure.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.705
I'm hoping Logan
don't show back up,

16:46.772 --> 16:48.974
{\an8}but if he does, it's gonna be
the same thing as last night.

16:49.041 --> 16:50.409
{\an8}He's gonna get another
country ass whoppin'.

16:50.476 --> 16:53.112

16:53.178 --> 16:55.748
{\an4}(Gus)
You gotta stop worrying about
him and worry about yourself.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.416
Yeah, Kortni,
you feel bad for someone

16:57.483 --> 16:59.218
that called your mom
a (bleep).

16:59.284 --> 17:00.652
You shouldn't feel bad for him.

17:00.719 --> 17:02.454
No, there's just something
mentally wrong with him.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.223
{\an1}There is something mentally
wrong with him,

17:04.289 --> 17:05.656
{\an1}but, Kortni,
I think if you press

17:05.723 --> 17:07.192
a restraining order on him.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.294
{\an1}I think that, you know,
maybe y'all could go to court

17:09.361 --> 17:10.896
and get him
some help.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.098
I think Kortni needs
to press a restraining order.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.534
And if she's smart,
she will

17:15.601 --> 17:18.404
because if it keeps on,
he's gonna end up hurting her,

17:18.470 --> 17:20.539
or her family, or us.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.741
I have been in a spot
with my ex

17:22.808 --> 17:24.410
to where he did
not want to be with me.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.078
And I just begged,
and begged,

17:26.145 --> 17:27.279
and begged, and begged,
and begged.

17:27.346 --> 17:29.014
And all I wanted
was to be with him,

17:29.081 --> 17:31.216
{\an1}and he would just reject me,
so, I know how that feels.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.118
And it's (bleep),
because I feel bad for him

17:33.185 --> 17:35.487
because he loves me,
or likes me,

17:35.554 --> 17:37.990
or feels that way about me
and I don't about him.

17:38.056 --> 17:39.625
I don't want him
in my life.

17:39.691 --> 17:41.627
And I feel like
I'm hurting him.

17:41.693 --> 17:44.296
That's just life.

make everybody happy.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.435
{\an4}(Codi)
You just gotta work on
making yourself happy first.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.336
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Yeah, look out
for number one.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.440
After this summer is over,
everybody's going back home.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.175
But this is Kortni's home.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.210
And she's got
to deal with this.

17:58.277 --> 17:59.778
This is here life here.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.447
{\an1}You shouldn't have
to put your life on hold,

18:01.513 --> 18:02.981
{\an4}because he's a crazy
mother(bleep).

18:01.513 --> 18:02.981
(Nilsa)
Exactly.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.249
I don't want
you to do that.

18:04.316 --> 18:05.851
You need to live
your best life however that is.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.653
And the thing is, maybe you
putting a restraining order

18:07.719 --> 18:09.555
on him will open his eyes up.

18:09.621 --> 18:12.357
{\an5}Say, "What? Well, maybe
I have a problem."

18:09.621 --> 18:12.357
Mm-hm.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.393
{\an1}Just go ahead and take
the steps because that--

18:14.460 --> 18:15.961

you're protected.

22:38.990 --> 22:42.494

want to be with Logan, you know?

22:38.990 --> 22:42.494
{\an3}Yeah.

stuff you need to work on too.

to be with Logan.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.898

{\an1}Stop wasting your time
with these lames out there.

{\an3}You know?

22:51.002 --> 22:53.371
{\an1}You know, you don't deserve
to be with somebody like that.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.941

22:56.007 --> 22:57.242

their worth.

they deserve to be treated.

23:06.251 --> 23:07.719

23:09.321 --> 23:11.323
You know, you deserve
so much better than that.

23:11.389 --> 23:14.693
I wish they would give
a good guy a chance one time.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.628
It would change their life.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.463

I'm gonna give to you.

of good advice,

23:21.099 --> 23:25.203
{\an8}but he also sheds light
in a situation

23:25.270 --> 23:28.306
and makes me feel better,
so I really appreciate him.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.442
Have you talked
to Gator today?

talk about it.

{\an8}and them just treat you
like (bleep).

23:41.753 --> 23:43.789
So, my heart really
goes out to Candace.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.858

Logan tonight,

38:28.205 --> 38:30.708
I might end up giving him
the gordita special.

38:30.775 --> 38:32.977
{\an8}I'm sick of his ass.
Get on, now.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.079
{\an8}(speaking gibberish)

38:35.146 --> 38:37.682
If he does,
lemme tell you something--

38:37.748 --> 38:40.317
{\an5}All hell will break loose.

38:37.748 --> 38:40.317
I'll break
all these nails off.

Get the (bleep) on.

Who's the bink
and who's the bop?

38:43.821 --> 38:46.157
{\an5}I'm the bop.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.157
He's the bop,
I'm the bink.

38:46.223 --> 38:48.693
Bop.

{\an3}Bop.

38:48.759 --> 38:52.063

38:48.759 --> 38:52.063
The double-B special.

{\an8}With a name like
Bink and Bop,

38:53.597 --> 38:55.266
{\an8}I just wanna call you
Dumb and Dumber.

Bink, bop, and boned.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.737
{\an3}You boned.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.737
I'm "Whore-tni."

38:59.804 --> 39:01.238
No, it's gotta start
with a B.

39:01.305 --> 39:03.307
It's gotta go with
the Bink and Bop.

39:03.374 --> 39:06.010
{\an5}Boned? I'm Boned?
I'll go with Boned.

the backseat up?

39:10.347 --> 39:13.718
Nope, Bink has to stay
with Bones at all times.

Everything good?

Bones, you wait for
the rest of the group.

Hold on, ma'am.
Hold on, ma'am.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.270
Don't get too close
to Bones.

Yeah, Jeremiah, we got this.

No Logan in sight.

{\an8}Hey, hey, hey,
they didn't tell you?

{\an8}Y'all can't come back
in here tonight.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.321
{\an8}I thought they told
you guys that.

Jeremiah's a really good guy.

And throughout all this
Logan bull(bleep),

40:11.575 --> 40:13.377
he's been making me feel
really good.
