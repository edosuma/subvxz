WEBVTT

02:42.735 --> 02:46.437
Give him another go, Ned.

02:46.439 --> 02:48.439
That's my father.

02:48.441 --> 02:50.107
And my Uncle Benjen.

02:50.109 --> 02:54.412
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

03:02.121 --> 03:04.822
They were all so happy.

03:05.558 --> 03:08.092
So were you once.

03:12.198 --> 03:16.133
Stop showing off.

03:16.135 --> 03:17.735
Lyanna!

03:17.737 --> 03:19.203
My Aunt Lyanna.

03:19.205 --> 03:21.705
<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

03:21.707 --> 03:26.110
My father never talked about her.

03:30.516 --> 03:33.350
<i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

03:33.352 --> 03:38.355
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

03:38.357 --> 03:39.557
<i>I don't know.</i>

03:39.559 --> 03:41.659
What about him?

03:42.562 --> 03:45.362
Wylis, come here.

03:50.336 --> 03:51.702
Hodor?

03:51.704 --> 03:53.471
<i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

03:53.473 --> 03:57.308
And you've got training.
Sounds like a fair match to me.

03:57.310 --> 03:59.844
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

03:59.846 --> 04:03.514
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

04:03.516 --> 04:06.150
Hodor talks?

04:10.189 --> 04:13.424
You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

04:13.426 --> 04:16.160
Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

04:16.161 --> 04:18.462
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

04:18.464 --> 04:20.498
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

04:20.500 --> 04:24.502
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

04:24.504 --> 04:26.403
So leave him be.

04:26.405 --> 04:28.639
It is time to go.

04:28.641 --> 04:31.375
Please, a little longer.

04:43.156 --> 04:46.524
You finally show me
something I care about

04:46.526 --> 04:47.858
and then you drag me away.

04:47.860 --> 04:51.629
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

04:51.631 --> 04:54.198
but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.936
I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

05:11.751 --> 05:14.218
Wylis.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.619
Hodor.

05:15.621 --> 05:17.521
I saw you as a boy.

05:17.523 --> 05:20.524
You could talk.

05:20.526 --> 05:23.360
What happened?

05:23.362 --> 05:25.529
Hodor.

05:29.502 --> 05:31.502
Where's Meera?

05:33.439 --> 05:35.606
Hodor.

06:01.267 --> 06:02.700
You shouldn't be here.

06:02.702 --> 06:05.636
It's not safe outside the cave.

06:05.638 --> 06:07.938
It's not safe anywhere.

06:10.576 --> 06:12.910
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

06:12.912 --> 06:14.912
- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

06:14.914 --> 06:20.251
And he could talk and
fight and... and then...

06:20.786 --> 06:22.519
What's wrong?

06:24.690 --> 06:27.791
The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

06:27.793 --> 06:30.861
And we're going to fight it in there?

06:59.759 --> 07:02.526
Brandon Stark needs you.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.363
For what?
I sit in there

07:06.365 --> 07:09.033
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

07:09.035 --> 07:11.869
He isn't going to stay here forever.

07:11.871 --> 07:16.073
And out there he needs you.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.967
<i>It's time, Ser Davos.</i>

07:43.969 --> 07:46.537
Open the door and the men inside

07:46.539 --> 07:49.640
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

07:53.646 --> 07:59.683
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

08:02.355 --> 08:05.389
Nobody needs to die tonight.

08:08.361 --> 08:11.428
I've never been much of a fighter.

08:17.603 --> 08:20.704
Apologies for what
you're about to see.

08:27.847 --> 08:29.713
Come on.

09:16.061 --> 09:17.661
Attack!

09:25.604 --> 09:27.971
Fight, you cowards!

09:59.705 --> 10:01.605
You fucking traitor.

10:01.607 --> 10:03.240
The only traitors here are the ones

10:03.242 --> 10:06.777
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

10:06.779 --> 10:10.147
For thousands of years
the Night's Watch

10:10.149 --> 10:13.650
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

10:13.652 --> 10:15.752
Until you.

10:24.864 --> 10:28.999
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

11:00.566 --> 11:04.101
<i>Took a lot of knives.</i>

11:06.272 --> 11:09.907
I'll have my men
get the wood for a fire.

11:10.676 --> 11:12.743
Bodies to burn.

11:19.585 --> 11:22.653
<i> Shh, hey.</i>

11:22.655 --> 11:26.590
Right, so there she is,
high and mighty Queen Cersei,

11:26.592 --> 11:28.859
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

11:28.861 --> 11:31.828
All of a sudden she looks my way.

11:31.830 --> 11:34.798
Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

11:34.800 --> 11:37.034
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

11:37.036 --> 11:39.836
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

11:39.838 --> 11:42.773
She's never seen anything like it.

11:42.775 --> 11:45.342
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

11:45.344 --> 11:48.345
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

11:48.347 --> 11:49.212
Ooh!

11:49.214 --> 11:54.151
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

11:55.054 --> 11:56.353
Well, you all know me.

11:56.355 --> 11:59.022
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

13:16.902 --> 13:18.068
Get out of my way.

13:18.070 --> 13:20.871
King's orders, Your Grace.

13:23.275 --> 13:24.408
What are the king's orders?

13:24.410 --> 13:28.011
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

13:28.013 --> 13:29.946
for your own protection.

13:30.416 --> 13:33.083
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

13:33.085 --> 13:38.755
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

13:39.391 --> 13:41.425
I would like to speak to my son.

13:41.427 --> 13:44.928
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.927
She grew up.

14:16.929 --> 14:18.395
<i>Almost.</i>

14:18.397 --> 14:22.165
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

14:23.902 --> 14:26.002
I expect it was Mother.

14:26.004 --> 14:28.271
Your mother wouldn't do that.

14:28.273 --> 14:30.173
Yes, she would.

14:32.044 --> 14:34.277
Are you angry with her?

14:34.279 --> 14:37.748
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

14:37.750 --> 14:40.150
She has every right to be here.

14:40.152 --> 14:44.254
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

14:44.256 --> 14:49.526
If she had tried...
They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again.

14:49.528 --> 14:52.162
Not while I'm here.

14:53.966 --> 14:57.167
Why haven't you gone to see her?

14:59.938 --> 15:02.506
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

15:02.508 --> 15:05.776
Don't you think I know that?

15:09.214 --> 15:11.381
I'm sorry.

15:13.051 --> 15:15.051
But I can't.

15:15.053 --> 15:16.820
Why not?

15:17.089 --> 15:21.291
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

15:21.293 --> 15:23.794
what did I do?

15:24.029 --> 15:28.532
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

15:28.534 --> 15:30.934
what did I do?

15:31.303 --> 15:33.270
We all fail sometimes.

15:33.272 --> 15:36.540
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

15:36.542 --> 15:41.011
If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

15:41.013 --> 15:42.212
what good am I?

15:42.214 --> 15:46.316
Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

15:48.287 --> 15:50.487
Your Grace.

15:50.489 --> 15:52.289
Lord Commander.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.991
I want to see my wife.

15:54.993 --> 15:57.127
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

15:57.129 --> 16:01.031
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

16:01.033 --> 16:04.000
The king must wait as well.

16:04.002 --> 16:07.170
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

16:17.015 --> 16:19.182
You're a bold man.

16:20.586 --> 16:22.285
On the contrary.

16:22.287 --> 16:24.955
I fear a great deal.

16:24.957 --> 16:28.358
The Father, the Mother,

16:28.360 --> 16:31.027
the Warrior.

16:40.072 --> 16:44.140
Do you know why we use these stones?

16:45.010 --> 16:47.377
To remind us not to fear death.

16:47.379 --> 16:51.281
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

16:51.283 --> 16:54.384
You must long for the next life.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.087
In truth, I fear that, too.

16:57.089 --> 17:00.190
You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

17:00.192 --> 17:03.159
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

17:03.161 --> 17:05.127
and atoned for her sin.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.964
What about my sins?

17:08.967 --> 17:13.603
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

17:14.973 --> 17:17.207
I killed my own cousin.

17:17.209 --> 17:19.276
When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

17:19.278 --> 17:22.412
I helped him escape their justice.

17:23.248 --> 17:26.616
What atonement do I deserve?

17:28.086 --> 17:30.687
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

17:30.689 --> 17:32.622
Oh, the gods won't mind.

17:32.624 --> 17:36.393
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

17:37.996 --> 17:39.996
Go on, then.

17:39.998 --> 17:43.500
I deserve it.
We all do.

17:43.502 --> 17:46.202
We are weak, vain creatures.

17:46.204 --> 17:49.472
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

18:04.022 --> 18:08.024
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

18:08.026 --> 18:09.292
I don't.

18:09.294 --> 18:12.495
They'd never reach me
before you struck.

18:12.497 --> 18:14.264
I've fought against worse odds.

18:14.266 --> 18:17.500
No doubt many of us would fall.

18:17.502 --> 18:20.470
But who are we, hmm?

18:20.472 --> 18:23.139
We have no names, no family.

18:23.141 --> 18:27.477
Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

18:27.479 --> 18:29.713
And yet together,

18:29.715 --> 18:33.249
we can overthrow an empire.

19:03.048 --> 19:05.181
<i>Mother.</i>

19:15.627 --> 19:19.496
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

19:20.665 --> 19:22.032
Gold.

19:22.034 --> 19:25.335
Good. It was always her color.

19:26.705 --> 19:30.774
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

19:32.344 --> 19:35.578
<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was...</i>

19:37.449 --> 19:41.117
I didn't want to lose you again.

19:41.119 --> 19:43.386
I understand.

19:45.090 --> 19:47.390
I'm glad to see you.

19:49.728 --> 19:52.462
I know I should have come sooner.

19:52.464 --> 19:56.533
I wanted to.
I was wrong.

19:57.469 --> 19:59.769
It's all right.

20:02.207 --> 20:04.774
No, it isn't.

20:05.710 --> 20:08.545
I should have executed all of them.

20:08.547 --> 20:10.080
I should have pulled down the sept

20:10.082 --> 20:14.684
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

20:14.686 --> 20:17.720
as you would have for me.

20:18.190 --> 20:21.458
You raised me to be strong...

20:23.195 --> 20:25.261
and I wasn't.

20:26.098 --> 20:28.631
But I want to be.

20:30.869 --> 20:33.169
Help me.

20:37.142 --> 20:39.209
Always.

21:06.438 --> 21:10.140
If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

21:13.578 --> 21:15.578
Meaning no offense.

21:15.580 --> 21:18.781
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

21:18.783 --> 21:20.216
I do not make dwarf jokes.

21:20.218 --> 21:22.352
You think them.

21:22.354 --> 21:25.922
So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

21:25.924 --> 21:30.426
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

21:30.428 --> 21:32.762
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

21:32.764 --> 21:36.332
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

21:36.334 --> 21:39.169
Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

21:39.171 --> 21:40.937
The Masters have retaken both cities.

21:40.939 --> 21:47.277
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

21:47.612 --> 21:52.715
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

21:52.717 --> 21:53.917
They are not eating.

21:53.919 --> 21:57.353
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

21:57.355 --> 21:59.622
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

21:59.624 --> 22:02.492
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

22:02.494 --> 22:06.362
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

22:06.364 --> 22:08.531
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

22:08.533 --> 22:11.367
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

22:11.369 --> 22:14.938
I drink and I know things.

22:15.941 --> 22:19.509
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

22:19.511 --> 22:22.245
ranged over hundreds of miles.

22:22.247 --> 22:23.846
Then Daenerys's ancestors

22:23.848 --> 22:26.983
started chaining them up in pens.

22:26.985 --> 22:28.751
A few generations later,

22:28.753 --> 22:32.522
the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

22:32.524 --> 22:36.526
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

22:37.662 --> 22:38.828
Missandei,

22:38.830 --> 22:42.632
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

22:42.634 --> 22:47.270
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

22:47.272 --> 22:48.938
Never.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.673
Dragons are intelligent.

22:50.675 --> 22:53.910
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

22:53.912 --> 22:56.546
They have affection for their friends

22:56.548 --> 22:59.015
and fury for their enemies.

22:59.751 --> 23:02.352
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

23:02.354 --> 23:06.489
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

24:36.681 --> 24:39.449
I'm friends with your mother.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.391
I'm here to help.

24:48.393 --> 24:50.993
Don't eat the help.

24:55.633 --> 24:56.632
When I was a child,

24:56.634 --> 25:00.703
an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

25:00.705 --> 25:02.805
I begged him for one of you.

25:02.807 --> 25:07.643
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

25:08.713 --> 25:11.714
"It could be little
like me."

25:16.855 --> 25:22.592
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

25:23.161 --> 25:25.395
Then my father told me

25:25.397 --> 25:29.399
the last dragon had died
a century ago.

25:29.401 --> 25:33.403
I cried myself to sleep that night.

25:41.780 --> 25:44.414
But here you are.

26:50.548 --> 26:53.916
Next time I have an idea like that,

26:53.918 --> 26:56.252
punch me in the face.

27:09.834 --> 27:11.767
What's your name?

27:18.076 --> 27:19.909
What's your name?

27:19.911 --> 27:23.513
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

27:23.515 --> 27:26.749
You don't believe that.

27:57.649 --> 28:00.550
Who are you?

28:01.753 --> 28:02.552
No one.

28:02.554 --> 28:04.720
If a girl says her name,

28:04.722 --> 28:08.157
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

28:08.159 --> 28:10.626
A girl has no name.

28:10.628 --> 28:12.828
If a girl says her name,

28:12.830 --> 28:15.097
a man will feed her tonight.

28:15.099 --> 28:18.100
A girl has no name.

28:18.870 --> 28:20.636
If a girl says her name,

28:20.638 --> 28:23.706
a man will give her eyes back.

28:24.809 --> 28:27.710
A girl has no name.

28:34.886 --> 28:37.286
Come.

28:45.229 --> 28:46.862
Leave it.

28:46.864 --> 28:50.199
<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

28:58.176 --> 29:02.044
We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.082
Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

29:06.084 --> 29:07.283
They obviously had help.

29:07.285 --> 29:11.354
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

29:11.823 --> 29:14.323
Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

29:14.325 --> 29:16.792
We know where she's going.

29:16.794 --> 29:18.694
Her brother's at Castle Black.

29:18.696 --> 29:20.296
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

29:20.298 --> 29:22.865
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

29:22.867 --> 29:25.401
So was I, Father.

29:25.403 --> 29:27.703
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

29:27.705 --> 29:29.939
as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

29:29.941 --> 29:32.274
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

29:32.276 --> 29:36.278
And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

29:36.280 --> 29:40.783
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow...

29:40.785 --> 29:43.786
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

29:43.788 --> 29:47.423
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

29:48.192 --> 29:50.192
We don't need
every house in the North.

29:50.194 --> 29:52.862
<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

29:52.864 --> 29:56.999
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

29:57.001 --> 29:59.435
With their support,
none could challenge us.

29:59.437 --> 30:04.240
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

30:04.242 --> 30:08.144
It's time for new blood in the North.

30:16.154 --> 30:19.221
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

30:19.223 --> 30:20.856
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

30:20.858 --> 30:24.894
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

30:25.697 --> 30:27.363
<i>My lords.</i>

30:27.365 --> 30:30.266
<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

30:30.268 --> 30:32.034
A boy.

30:32.036 --> 30:34.403
<i>Red-cheeked and healthy.</i>

30:34.405 --> 30:38.474
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

30:47.151 --> 30:49.752
Congratulations, Father.

30:50.121 --> 30:53.956
I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

30:57.462 --> 31:00.863
You'll always be my firstborn.

31:01.432 --> 31:03.933
Thank you for saying that.

31:03.935 --> 31:06.936
It means a great deal to me.

31:42.940 --> 31:44.306
Maester Wolkan,

31:44.308 --> 31:49.512
<i>send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.</i>

31:50.515 --> 31:53.382
Poisoned by our enemies.

31:59.257 --> 32:01.891
How did he die?

32:04.862 --> 32:07.296
Poisoned by his enemies.

32:07.298 --> 32:11.167
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

32:12.103 --> 32:14.370
Forgive me, my lord.

32:16.874 --> 32:19.542
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

32:20.478 --> 32:23.212
She's resting, my lord.

32:26.050 --> 32:28.551
At once, my lord.

32:53.177 --> 32:55.044
There he is.

32:55.046 --> 32:57.479
Isn't he wonderful?

33:00.585 --> 33:03.052
May I hold him?

33:03.888 --> 33:06.388
Of... of course.

33:16.033 --> 33:18.400
Little brother.

33:18.970 --> 33:21.103
Lord Bolton sent for us.

33:21.105 --> 33:23.239
Have you seen him?

33:31.082 --> 33:35.050
Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

33:51.936 --> 33:54.403
Where is Lord Bolton?

34:03.681 --> 34:05.247
Down!

34:05.249 --> 34:08.417
<i> It's all right. Come on, shh.</i>

34:08.418 --> 34:13.054
<i>It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.</i>

34:18.329 --> 34:22.264
Ramsay, where is your father?

34:23.234 --> 34:25.266
Ramsay.

34:32.409 --> 34:35.277
Where is Lord Bolton?

34:41.252 --> 34:43.953
I am Lord Bolton.

34:53.331 --> 34:55.431
Ramsay.

34:55.433 --> 34:56.498
Ramsay, please.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.369
I'll leave Winterfell.
I'll go back to the Riverlands.

35:05.409 --> 35:07.443
Please.

35:07.445 --> 35:09.745
Ramsay.

35:11.215 --> 35:13.515
He's your brother.

35:15.653 --> 35:18.487
I prefer being an only child.

35:38.509 --> 35:41.577
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

35:41.579 --> 35:43.045
I don't think he hurt her.

35:43.047 --> 35:47.383
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

35:48.552 --> 35:50.519
You don't know which way she went?

35:50.521 --> 35:53.288
I spent three days looking for her.

35:53.290 --> 35:55.290
She disappeared.

35:57.161 --> 35:58.627
How'd she look?

35:58.629 --> 36:00.496
She looked good.

36:00.498 --> 36:04.433
She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

36:05.269 --> 36:07.469
No, she wouldn't be.

36:08.773 --> 36:11.540
What happened at Winterfell?

36:22.086 --> 36:26.155
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

36:26.157 --> 36:29.792
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

36:33.330 --> 36:36.632
We've all had to make
difficult choices.

36:56.387 --> 36:59.088
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

36:59.090 --> 36:59.855
It's not safe.

36:59.857 --> 37:01.223
He won't stop hunting us.

37:01.225 --> 37:02.658
We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

37:02.660 --> 37:05.227
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

37:05.229 --> 37:08.797
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

37:08.799 --> 37:10.199
I won't let him.

37:10.201 --> 37:13.202
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

37:13.537 --> 37:17.206
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

37:17.208 --> 37:21.844
And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

37:23.114 --> 37:26.849
And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

37:27.384 --> 37:30.719
When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

37:30.721 --> 37:33.355
I don't want to be forgiven.

37:34.792 --> 37:37.259
I can never make
amends to your family

37:37.261 --> 37:39.428
for the things I've done.

37:40.397 --> 37:43.732
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

37:47.705 --> 37:51.206
You're not coming with us?

37:52.276 --> 37:56.578
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

37:57.181 --> 37:59.648
I would have died to get you there.

38:15.699 --> 38:18.834
May I take one of the horses?

38:21.772 --> 38:24.640
Where will you go?

38:26.911 --> 38:29.378
Home.

38:36.754 --> 38:41.456
<i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

38:41.458 --> 38:43.692
And the Ironborn who held it?

38:43.694 --> 38:47.696
They died fighting to a man.

38:48.599 --> 38:50.799
What is dead may never die.

38:50.801 --> 38:53.468
What is dead may never die.

38:53.470 --> 38:55.270
But they did

38:55.272 --> 38:57.506
and our invasion died with them.

38:57.508 --> 39:01.376
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

39:01.378 --> 39:02.778
Then we will take more.

39:02.780 --> 39:06.915
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

39:08.586 --> 39:10.852
Because I order it.

39:10.854 --> 39:12.788
We can defeat anyone at sea,

39:12.790 --> 39:15.490
but we'll never hold
lands and castles

39:15.492 --> 39:16.692
against mainland armies.

39:16.694 --> 39:18.594
Not if our captains defy my orders,

39:18.596 --> 39:23.498
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

39:23.500 --> 39:26.235
I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

39:26.237 --> 39:27.302
Then where is he?

39:27.304 --> 39:28.937
Where is your kingdom?

39:28.939 --> 39:33.909
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

39:33.911 --> 39:35.677
That war is over.

39:35.679 --> 39:37.412
The last time
we provoked them too far,

39:37.414 --> 39:40.515
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

39:40.517 --> 39:42.517
<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

39:42.519 --> 39:44.653
<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

39:44.655 --> 39:47.856
And I lost three sons.

39:48.259 --> 39:50.492
The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

39:50.494 --> 39:51.727
Well, the other four are dead.

39:51.729 --> 39:55.697
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

39:55.699 --> 39:57.633
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

39:57.635 --> 40:01.336
or I will make another heir who will.

40:39.610 --> 40:41.843
Let me pass.

40:43.514 --> 40:47.683
You fool, move aside for your king.

40:47.951 --> 40:50.652
Haven't I always, brother?

40:59.063 --> 41:04.099
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

41:04.101 --> 41:08.403
What is dead may never die.

41:09.506 --> 41:12.607
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

41:12.609 --> 41:14.943
Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

41:14.945 --> 41:18.380
You can mock our god without my help.

41:18.382 --> 41:21.416
I don't mock the Drowned God.

41:21.418 --> 41:24.419
I am the Drowned God.

41:24.421 --> 41:26.021
From Oldtown to Qarth,

41:26.023 --> 41:29.991
when men see my sails, they pray.

41:38.535 --> 41:42.137
You're old, brother.

41:42.139 --> 41:44.106
<i>You've had your time.</i>

41:44.108 --> 41:46.508
Now let another rule.

41:46.510 --> 41:49.678
I heard you lost your mind

41:49.680 --> 41:52.147
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

41:52.149 --> 41:58.720
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

41:58.722 --> 41:59.654
They did.

41:59.656 --> 42:04.860
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

42:04.862 --> 42:07.429
I needed silence.

42:07.931 --> 42:10.031
What kind of an Ironborn

42:10.033 --> 42:14.436
loses his senses during a storm?

42:14.438 --> 42:18.039
I am the storm, brother.

42:18.041 --> 42:21.143
The first storm and the last.

42:22.045 --> 42:24.780
And you're in my way.

43:01.618 --> 43:06.154
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

43:06.156 --> 43:09.891
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

43:09.893 --> 43:11.793
Pull his bones down to your depths

43:11.795 --> 43:14.896
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

43:14.898 --> 43:18.066
What is dead may never die.

43:26.477 --> 43:28.777
I'm going to find out who did this.

43:28.779 --> 43:32.981
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

43:33.851 --> 43:36.585
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

43:36.587 --> 43:39.688
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

43:39.690 --> 43:41.756
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

43:41.758 --> 43:43.225
My father would have
wanted me to rule.

43:43.227 --> 43:47.896
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

43:49.633 --> 43:50.932
Perhaps you'll win.

43:50.934 --> 43:55.704
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the Ironborn.

43:56.540 --> 43:58.740
And perhaps not.

44:15.092 --> 44:17.225
Come in.

44:22.232 --> 44:26.601
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

44:26.603 --> 44:29.204
You interrupt nothing.

44:40.083 --> 44:44.085
I assume you know why I'm here.

44:44.721 --> 44:46.154
I will after you tell me.

44:46.156 --> 44:48.657
It's about the Lord Commander.

44:48.659 --> 44:51.593
The former Lord Commander.

44:52.629 --> 44:54.696
Does he have to be?

44:57.601 --> 45:00.268
What are you asking?

45:03.574 --> 45:08.043
Do you know of any magic...

45:09.146 --> 45:10.946
that could help him?

45:10.948 --> 45:12.013
Bring him back?

45:12.015 --> 45:15.116
If you want to help him,
leave him be.

45:15.118 --> 45:17.085
Can it be done?

45:17.087 --> 45:19.888
There are some with this power.

45:19.890 --> 45:22.691
- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

45:22.693 --> 45:24.259
Have you seen it done?

45:26.663 --> 45:29.364
I met a man who came
back from the dead,

45:29.366 --> 45:32.367
but the priest
who did it...

45:32.369 --> 45:34.636
it shouldn't have been possible.

45:34.638 --> 45:38.106
But it was.
It could be now.

45:38.108 --> 45:40.942
Not for me.

45:44.748 --> 45:47.115
Not for you?

45:49.653 --> 45:53.355
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

45:53.357 --> 45:57.125
I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

45:57.127 --> 45:59.628
Everything I believed,

45:59.630 --> 46:03.331
the great victory
I saw in the flames,

46:03.333 --> 46:05.667
all of it was a lie.

46:09.172 --> 46:11.206
You were right all along.

46:11.208 --> 46:14.242
The Lord never spoke to me.

46:14.244 --> 46:16.244
Fuck him, then.

46:16.246 --> 46:18.847
Fuck all of them.

46:19.783 --> 46:23.051
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

46:23.053 --> 46:27.756
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

46:29.826 --> 46:32.360
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

46:32.362 --> 46:38.133
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

46:39.403 --> 46:41.870
I never had this gift.

46:41.872 --> 46:44.305
Have you ever tried?

50:26.663 --> 50:29.964
Please.
