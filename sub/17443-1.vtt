00:55.305 --> 00:58.759
You cannot bury her in
consecrated ground.

00:58.767 --> 01:03.017
- She was not Christian.
- This is my ground.

01:03.021 --> 01:07.522
- It is the Lord's ground.
- Then let the Lord refuse her.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.236
She will not rest
with Christian dead.

01:10.237 --> 01:13.862
She will not rest because
she is not dead.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.694
To me.

01:18.287 --> 01:22.623
And she will not die because
she willed not to die.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.328
Is her will stronger than the Lord's?

01:36.346 --> 01:39.345
These are her words.

01:39.975 --> 01:44.270
"Man need not kneel
before the angels.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.314
Nor lie in death forever,

01:46.315 --> 01:49.483
but for the weakness
of his feeble will.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.777
- Blasphemy.
- Benediction.

01:51.778 --> 01:56.449
Now hear mine. She desecrates
the earth in which she lies.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.201
And her will rots with her bones.

01:59.202 --> 02:03.327
Both are as damned and
dead as the devil's soul.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.382
A nervous contraction.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.635
Nothing more.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.267
Nothing more.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.770
So silent now?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.907
Well, why don't you speak?

02:37.908 --> 02:40.736
Or you? Or you?

02:41.578 --> 02:44.281
Pray, speak.

02:44.373 --> 02:48.794
Or has the cat got your tongues?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.831
You must have met in hell.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.677
- The fox may go to ground, my lord.
- Damn the fox! Where's my daughter?

06:25.678 --> 06:27.879
Hey I say, where's my daughter?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.646
Rowena!

06:39.900 --> 06:43.730
- Rowena!
- Hello, Christopher.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.617
Come on, boy.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.876
Rowena, the fox has...

06:58.877 --> 07:01.626
Don't bother the fox. I found
something far more intriguing.

08:23.628 --> 08:26.126
Ligeia...

08:45.859 --> 08:48.107
Now puss...

09:08.506 --> 09:11.300
- What do you want?
- I heard her scream.

09:11.301 --> 09:16.382
She was thrown by her mount. I thought
it unwise for her to move immediately.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.058
In preventing it, I seem
to have frightened her.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.727
Yes, quite.

09:21.394 --> 09:22.720
I thought the abbey was deserted.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.101
- It is...
- Yes, but...

09:24.105 --> 09:28.310
Save for myself, a servant and...

09:28.318 --> 09:32.944
- Is she all right?
- Yes, quite all right, Christopher.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.366
Verden?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.571
Good Lord!

09:40.580 --> 09:43.454
I never would have...

09:44.209 --> 09:46.001
Those glasses...

09:46.002 --> 09:50.002
The result of a rather
morbid reaction to sunlight.

09:50.006 --> 09:53.217
But I thought that...
that not hearing from you, I...

09:53.218 --> 09:55.052
I mean, after the funeral...

09:55.053 --> 09:58.263
Perhaps you had better
fetch the lady's horse.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.468
Yes. Yes, of course.

10:02.644 --> 10:06.815
Rowena... don't be frightened.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.985
He's an old friend.

10:11.986 --> 10:16.612
Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tromane.
May I present Mr. Verden Fell.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.110
How do you do?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.661
How do you do?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.031
Terribly sorry to have trampled
these lovely asphodels.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.578
They're so bright.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.461
The flowers of death.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.293
How very appropriate.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.384
Yes...

10:50.859 --> 10:53.026
Perhaps you'd better take her
in while I fetch her father.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.525
That won't be necessary.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.736
I'm afraid it will.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.777
You aren't blind, are you?

11:35.778 --> 11:40.700
No, no I live at night.
My vision is painfully acute.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.206
Oh, no! No! Please!
Please, that light!

11:54.255 --> 11:58.675
- I'm sorry. I only thought...
- No.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.878
No, please.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.089
I'm sorry.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.525
Kenrick!

12:26.537 --> 12:29.581
Sherry and some linen bandages.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.094
The same cat?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.399
Is it broken?

12:55.400 --> 12:59.480
It doesn't appear to be,
but it needs binding, however.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.612
Ma'am.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.116
Thank you.

13:14.919 --> 13:20.250
You do that rather well.
Where did you learn?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.794
I see.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.179
Do you suppose I could make you smile?
Or do you ever laugh, Mr. Fell?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.384
Only at myself.

13:31.561 --> 13:37.143
- I see.
- Do you? You keep saying, "I see."

13:37.150 --> 13:40.900
But I think your vision is
even more limited than mine.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.030
Rowena!

13:43.031 --> 13:46.280
- Rowena!
- Here, Father.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.203
- Are you all right?
- Lord Trevanion, may I present...

13:50.204 --> 13:51.997
Oh, doctor here already? Splendid.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.666
- No father. Mr. Verden... - Splendid,
now are you sure you're all right?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.793
- Yes father.
- Good. Well, I want to show you this.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.339
Damnedest fox you ever saw.
Must be a freak.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.800
The markings are so damn queer.
I've never seen anything like it.

14:03.801 --> 14:05.385
Oh, Father, please.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.179
Lord Trevanion, Mr. Fell...

14:07.180 --> 14:09.931
Fell? Oh of course, the doctor.
Terribly rude of me.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.141
Father he is not...

14:11.142 --> 14:13.783
Here, doctor, have a look at this fox.
What do you think of it, eh?

14:14.437 --> 14:17.265
Of course, I suppose foxes
aren't much in your line.

14:17.273 --> 14:21.023
It belongs to the
species vulpas pallida.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.730
Peculiar to upper Egypt
in the Nubian Desert.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.902
In Egyptian art, it is found
at the feet of Ashtophet,

14:28.910 --> 14:35.493
goddess of ill-omened
marriages... as her pet.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.836
Hmm... Really?

14:40.046 --> 14:42.714
Well I mean if it belongs in
Egypt, what's it doing here?

14:42.715 --> 14:45.714
It was once kept here
by the Lady Ligeia.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.344
As a pet? A fox?

14:50.348 --> 14:52.846
Who on earth would
do a thing like that?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.597
My wife.

14:58.064 --> 15:03.236
I think we ought to be going now.
Christopher, help me on with my boot.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.696
- Are...?
- I'm fine now, Father.

15:07.073 --> 15:08.323
Have I said something?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.368
- Of course not!
- It's all right, Father.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.999
- Hey, the fox.
- In the wicker, my lord.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.794
- No, it's not!
- I beg your pardon, my lord?

15:20.795 --> 15:23.589
I said it's not.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.596
Well, where could it...?
I mean, how could it...?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.925
Well, perhaps you can tell me.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.855
- Through here.
- But the fox was dead.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.449
The cat was not.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.326
It appears that the cat
has made off with the fox.

15:53.327 --> 15:57.031
But is that possible? I mean...

15:57.081 --> 16:00.160
Were it not possible,
the fox would still be here.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.789
I trust that your ankle will
give you no further trouble.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.632
I'm afraid this is a bit awkward.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.886
Do you mind if I send your
fee by messenger, Doctor?

16:10.887 --> 16:13.886
That won't be necessary.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.059
Thank you.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.222
Goodbye, then.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.829
Well?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.540
Has Ligeia's death
changed him greatly?

16:40.541 --> 16:43.790
He's certainly changed,
but I never knew her.

16:43.794 --> 16:48.625
- Was he always so morose?
- A bit mysterious, perhaps.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.718
Do you like him?

16:51.719 --> 16:55.138
I don't think so, but what
has that to do with it?

16:55.139 --> 16:57.592
To do with what?

16:57.600 --> 17:02.101
Who one is drawn to, who one loves,
even who one marries.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.814
- Marry? Marry who?
- The doctor, Father.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.358
Now you stay here, my girl.

17:08.694 --> 17:13.319
Willful little bitch, ain't she?
Hell to be married to, I should think.

17:13.366 --> 17:16.319
Her mother certainly was,
God rest her soul.

17:17.203 --> 17:22.034
I'm told that Ligeia too
was not without... willfulness.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.124
Peperel! Peperel!

17:29.131 --> 17:32.175
- Where the devil is...
- Behind you, my lord.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.847
Damn me if I eat with
Squire Daniels again.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.892
Bad breeding only
exceeded by worse whisky.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.095
From Mr. Fell, sir.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.819
Please, see this reaches him immed...
as soon as possible.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.991
Christopher, I'm riding down
to the village. I can easily...

17:55.992 --> 17:58.240
That won't be necessary,
my dear. Bye.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.581
- Well, off to the assizes.
- The assizes, huh.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.040
I've got an important brief.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.495
How a gentleman can continue
to practice law is beyond me.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.342
- My lady, I...
- Thank you, Peperel.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.865
Rowena?

19:27.792 --> 19:33.920
I thought it was... Never, never,
never come here unannounced.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.466
Do you understand?

19:36.467 --> 19:39.716
I do not like to be
discovered unannounced.

19:39.762 --> 19:43.762
Stop that! Stop it!

19:46.394 --> 19:48.728
I'll get you something.

19:48.729 --> 19:54.186
I can't send you off shivering like
a frightened kitten, now, can I?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.313
Come here.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.864
Your hair...

20:02.868 --> 20:05.912
It makes a shambles of the light.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.117
Come along.

20:20.094 --> 20:25.801
I dare say you've never had
tea in the kitchen before.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.011
No, I haven't.

20:30.855 --> 20:34.104
- Here.
- Thank you.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.530
Does she look like me?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.827
Who?

20:50.875 --> 20:55.546
The woman you seem so afraid
will arrive unannounced.

20:56.589 --> 20:59.417
Why did you come here?

21:00.259 --> 21:03.508
To deliver Christopher's
reply to your note.

21:06.307 --> 21:09.306
Really to see you. Sugar?

21:11.312 --> 21:14.140
I have nothing to offer.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.859
You make me want to
offer you something.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.445
Pity prompts you.

21:22.948 --> 21:27.244
There are people one pities
without being drawn to them.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.659
I suppose I even pity Christopher.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.588
He's blinded in his
way too, you know.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.175
His life being simply law and logic.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.135
To be so limited.

21:44.136 --> 21:49.307
The beauty of such a life lies in its
limitations and in accepting them.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.510
Oh, I know.

21:52.561 --> 21:56.391
I suppose I'm spoiled
and terribly willful.

21:58.234 --> 22:03.361
Willful? You don't even know
the meaning of the word.

22:05.282 --> 22:08.201
Now, I think you'd better go.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.327
Why?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.006
Why must I go?

22:26.428 --> 22:30.223
Do you suppose I might
be announced? I am expected.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.518
Very good, sir.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.890
You don't understand.

22:37.898 --> 22:42.274
- I can welcome no one here.
- Not even in the kitchen of all places?

22:42.278 --> 22:44.947
- Wait. Wait.
- Let me go!

22:45.906 --> 22:48.484
I'm sorry.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.615
Please, let me go.

22:51.704 --> 22:56.375
Yes. Yes, that is, after all
what I want too, isn't it?

22:57.501 --> 23:00.375
To be let go.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.423
Yes, of course, of course.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.463
Pale and cold and...

23:08.470 --> 23:11.298
and yet, so much life...

23:12.558 --> 23:15.432
It was her longing for life...

23:16.520 --> 23:20.350
only for life, that haunts me.

23:21.609 --> 23:25.987
To want life so desperately,
that when she lost it, her...

23:25.988 --> 23:28.407
Her will to live remained alive!

23:29.450 --> 23:32.995
My eyes see the shadows
gather with shame.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.283
Seeing you

23:37.291 --> 23:40.209
and seeing her.

23:40.210 --> 23:46.588
Yet, when you thought I was Ligeia,
you tried to attack me.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.465
I don't remember.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.439
Not very fetching, am I?

24:01.440 --> 24:04.484
Morose, moody...

24:05.527 --> 24:10.107
I stagger about like some
drunken lord in some...

24:29.718 --> 24:32.922
It seems as though you're always
looking after my wounds.

24:32.930 --> 24:37.058
Beg pardon, sir, but Mr. Christopher
Gough wishes to be announced.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.102
He's in the refectory.

24:39.853 --> 24:44.058
- Can I be helping, sir?
- Yes. Yes, Kenrick, please.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.939
Take care of this...

24:45.943 --> 24:48.653
Forgive me, my dear,
but I must see Christopher.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.982
- Forgive me.
- Of course.

24:50.990 --> 24:55.115
Kenrick, bring the Lady Rowena into
the great hall when you've finished.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.328
And please fetch my glasses.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.372
I believe you'll find
them by the portal.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.992
Oh, and Kenrick...

25:02.960 --> 25:06.334
I want that animal destroyed.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.857
It's wax.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.652
It's a reproduction.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.951
I managed to make it myself.

25:39.955 --> 25:44.035
You see, I am loath to
open ancient tombs...

25:44.960 --> 25:49.711
rob a nation of its treasure
and call it archaeology.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.716
- It's quite good, really.
- Thank you.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.718
Twenty... first dynasty?

25:53.719 --> 25:56.342
No, twentieth, but a delta dynasty.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.049
A little known and less remembered.

26:00.142 --> 26:02.935
You can tell by the eyes.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.138
The eyes...

26:06.190 --> 26:08.392
they confound me.

26:09.359 --> 26:12.153
There is a blankness,

26:12.196 --> 26:18.117
a mindless sort of malice
in some Egyptian eyes.

26:18.118 --> 26:22.198
They do not readily yield
up the mystery they hold.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.001
Verden... Verden!

26:27.002 --> 26:28.829
Hmm?

26:28.837 --> 26:31.756
- You were saying?
- Oh.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.176
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.379
Forgive me.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.589
Forgive my reverie.

26:40.224 --> 26:45.396
Lately, I... I seem to
slip into reveries.

26:47.856 --> 26:50.855
The Lady Rowena
will join us presently.

26:52.486 --> 26:56.566
And I have much to say
to you before she does.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.110
Christopher...

27:00.119 --> 27:02.912
not ten minutes ago, I...

27:02.913 --> 27:06.617
I tried to kill a stray
cat with a cabbage,

27:07.209 --> 27:10.333
and all but made love
to the Lady Rowena.

27:10.337 --> 27:16.795
I succeeded in squashing the cabbage,
and badly frightening the lady.

27:19.304 --> 27:24.976
If only I could lay open my own brain
as easily as I did that vegetable,

27:24.977 --> 27:28.898
what rot would be freed
from its grey leaves?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.028
- Let's go for a stroll.
- A stroll?

27:36.029 --> 27:40.405
A stroll, a walk. What the devil
difference does it make? Come on.

27:41.535 --> 27:45.865
- What was she, Kenrick?
- "She", ma'am?

27:45.873 --> 27:47.916
Ligeia.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.792
Perhaps none of you took note

27:49.793 --> 27:52.212
but it seems apparent to
me she wasn't quite human!

27:52.379 --> 27:54.502
So, what was she?

27:54.506 --> 27:58.586
- Her hair was black, I believe.
- Do you? Excellent.

27:58.635 --> 28:03.215
Black on one of her heads and
green on the other, perhaps?

28:03.223 --> 28:07.303
- Only one head, madam.
- How disappointing.

28:07.311 --> 28:11.561
But her eyes, were they
gold or silver? Ow!

28:12.191 --> 28:16.988
- I don't remember.
- But she did have eyes, I take it?

28:18.822 --> 28:20.990
Never mind, Kenrick.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.785
If you don't want to talk about it,
I won't pry. Thank you.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.614
I'm sorry, ma'am.

28:27.623 --> 28:31.077
- Are you?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:32.044 --> 28:37.546
Early this day, I found myself standing
once again before Ligeia's grave,

28:37.591 --> 28:42.718
allowing me to observe a
rather singular circumstance.

28:42.763 --> 28:47.810
The date of her death had disappeared
from Ligeia's tombstone,

28:47.851 --> 28:51.180
And yet it was there yesterday
when we came upon the Lady Rowena.

28:51.188 --> 28:52.854
I don't know which confounds me more.

28:52.855 --> 28:56.359
The defacing of the grave or the
importance you seem to place upon it.

28:56.360 --> 29:00.360
- Doesn't it seem to be a bit odd to you?
- Well, yes, it does.

29:01.031 --> 29:04.360
Seems grotesque, as a matter of fact.
A malicious prank.

29:04.368 --> 29:09.620
- Whose malicious prank?
- Good Lord, Verden, I don't know.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.958
What are you trying to tell me?

29:11.959 --> 29:15.880
Simply that this occurrence is
neither a prank nor malicious.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.215
Look at that stone, Christopher.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.215
Consider what has been
cut from the marble.

29:23.136 --> 29:26.840
Not her name...
not the inscription...

29:27.849 --> 29:30.723
only the date of her death.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.556
Where's the date of her birth?

29:36.483 --> 29:39.607
I never knew her age.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.987
And consider, Christopher,
how carefully it has been cut.

29:43.991 --> 29:47.240
Surely not the work of
any malicious prankster.

29:48.245 --> 29:53.040
The ancients carved prophecies
in their stone tombs.

29:53.041 --> 29:58.337
- This prank is also a prophecy.
- Of what? From whom?

29:58.338 --> 30:02.259
- Verden, this is surely something...
- Of return, Christopher.

30:02.551 --> 30:04.885
Of Ligeia's return.

30:04.886 --> 30:09.592
- Verden...
- No. No pray, hear me out.

30:10.976 --> 30:15.056
These words were among the
last she ever spoke to me...

30:16.148 --> 30:18.476
"Nor lie in death forever."

30:19.776 --> 30:25.608
"Man need not kneel before the
angels nor lie in death forever,

30:25.615 --> 30:30.321
save for the weakness
of his feeble will."

30:30.370 --> 30:36.498
Ligeia's will was as fierce as her...
as her body was frail.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.371
Outwardly calm, even placid...

30:40.172 --> 30:43.174
she nevertheless pitted
herself against death

30:43.175 --> 30:46.754
with a passion words
are impotent to convey.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.386
As her body progressively wasted,

30:50.390 --> 30:55.812
she seemed to turn to the very stones
of the abbey for renewed strength,

30:55.854 --> 31:00.810
as if they could sustain that
burning desire for life...

31:01.443 --> 31:08.197
only for life, that ravaged her
as much as the fever of disease.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.161
In a sense, Ligeia became the abbey.

31:12.704 --> 31:17.580
She never entered or left a room,
never walked down the darkest passageway

31:17.584 --> 31:23.041
without somehow illuminating
it like a single moving candle.

31:24.424 --> 31:29.380
Like a blind man, I could sense her
presence, but I could not see her

31:29.429 --> 31:32.678
and even in the most
trivial objects and actions.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.185
Her voice in the rustle of draperies,

31:36.186 --> 31:39.230
the lightness of her footfall

31:39.231 --> 31:44.777
in the fluttering of a moth's wing
against a closed window pane.

31:44.778 --> 31:49.028
Even at the end, she seemed
to have vanquished death.

31:49.032 --> 31:54.489
She smiled and said,
"I will always be your wife...

31:55.372 --> 31:57.825
your only wife."

31:58.875 --> 32:01.669
"I have willed it."

32:37.122 --> 32:41.077
Have you ever tried to recall
to memory something forgotten,

32:41.084 --> 32:44.163
being upon the very
verge of rememberance

32:45.589 --> 32:49.089
and yet, in the end,
being unable to remember?

32:49.759 --> 32:51.176
No.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.718
No, if I fear, it's...

32:55.765 --> 32:58.593
it's for my mind that I fear.

32:59.811 --> 33:05.108
What, after all, is madness,
but belief in... in what does not exist?

33:06.526 --> 33:10.230
I believed in Ligeia, in her will...

33:11.072 --> 33:13.650
and I believed too well.

33:14.159 --> 33:18.037
Consider the skill and
the instruments required

33:18.038 --> 33:21.457
to cut the date of her
death from that stone,

33:21.458 --> 33:26.755
and consider my skill
with such instruments.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.384
And consider my hand

33:31.426 --> 33:34.630
guilty with marble.

33:34.638 --> 33:39.560
- I cut the date from that stone.
- And you didn't know?

33:41.311 --> 33:44.139
No, not until now.

33:45.482 --> 33:48.400
So, you see, if I fear, it's...

33:48.401 --> 33:52.947
- ...it's for my mind.
- What? Why now?

33:53.490 --> 33:55.317
Verden, you must get away.

33:55.325 --> 33:57.323
You must find something.
Your work, or someone...

34:58.096 --> 35:02.392
You're safe now, my darling.
You're safe with me.

35:45.518 --> 35:49.894
When I was a child, we stayed by
the sea in the small house on the hill.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.650
I remember very little
of my childhood.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.944
I lived with my father
in the wild country.

35:55.945 --> 36:00.651
- What was your father like?
- He was a strong man.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.988
His very manner was
formed by the landscape.

36:03.995 --> 36:08.871
In his forehead, you could see the
line of the hills against the sky.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.540
I feel I want to begin
again with you.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.254
Take me somewhere
I've never been before,

36:14.255 --> 36:16.958
somewhere new, for us.

36:17.801 --> 36:22.427
In Celtic religion, Stonehenge was
a temple to the god of healing.

36:22.430 --> 36:25.258
It was built more
than 3,000 years ago,

36:25.266 --> 36:28.060
and do you know why it
remains today, Rowena?

36:28.061 --> 36:30.978
Because it was built
with a sense of purpose,

36:30.979 --> 36:33.857
stone by stone,
like the pyramids in Egypt

36:33.858 --> 36:36.485
or like the Aztec towers in Mexico.

36:36.486 --> 36:41.283
- Like our abbey.
- Yes, my dear, yes, like our abbey.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.545
Where are we?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.669
It won't be long now.

37:01.636 --> 37:05.466
Christopher reached me by
post when we were in Rome.

37:05.473 --> 37:09.428
The papers for the sale of the
abbey are almost all in order.

37:09.436 --> 37:14.142
Tomorrow, we'll have a party
to celebrate our return,

37:14.149 --> 37:16.351
and our leaving.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.740
Well, here we are, my dear.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.700
Come along.

37:31.916 --> 37:35.120
Well for the moment,
this is your home, Rowena.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.253
Welcome home, ma'am.

37:47.432 --> 37:51.512
- Your personal maid, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

37:51.561 --> 37:55.641
Thank you. Oh, thank you.
They're simply lovely.

37:56.399 --> 37:58.693
Oh, Verden, I...

38:00.487 --> 38:04.112
As long as we have to stay here,
you will be comfortable.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.978
Verden?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.984
Verden?

40:02.567 --> 40:06.738
I tell you, it's not the fox, Doctor,
it's the hunt. The hunt.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.281
To pit your wits and that
of a pack of hounds'

40:09.282 --> 40:11.951
against sheer animal cunning;
it's more than sport.

40:12.285 --> 40:14.237
For the fox at any rate.

40:18.124 --> 40:22.420
Your bride seems in an unusually
reflective mood tonight.

40:23.212 --> 40:24.755
The journey no doubt tired her.

40:24.756 --> 40:30.383
Yes I dare say. What news
on the sale of the abbey?

40:30.803 --> 40:33.096
Something rather awkward.

40:33.097 --> 40:37.351
More difficulty over the
estate lying in two counties?

40:37.352 --> 40:40.601
- No.
- What then?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.776
The deed to the abbey
is in Ligeia's name

40:45.777 --> 40:48.362
and I can locate no
certificate of her death.

40:48.363 --> 40:52.363
- What can be done?
- Nothing without that.

40:53.242 --> 40:57.572
- There never was a certification.
- But surely...

40:57.622 --> 41:00.621
The county authorities would have insisted
on ascertaining the cause of her death.

41:00.667 --> 41:03.835
The confusion of the
two counties again.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.380
Each assumed that the other had
seen to it. It's as simple as that.

41:06.381 --> 41:12.678
It's not as simple as that. The abbey,
much of the estate is in her name.

41:12.679 --> 41:17.305
Should this be discovered,
there'll be an inquest, possibly more.

41:19.811 --> 41:25.232
No one. No one will
go near Ligeia's grave.

41:25.233 --> 41:29.609
We all hunt for different
things in our lives, Baron.

41:29.612 --> 41:35.694
A colleague of mine in Switzerland,
a charlatan really, one Franz Mesmer,

41:35.702 --> 41:38.370
claims to have brought
to ground some subtle

41:38.371 --> 41:41.456
and invisible fluid with
miraculous healing powers.

41:41.457 --> 41:43.955
Mesmer may be a charlatan, doctor,

41:44.544 --> 41:49.375
but the power which he calls
"hypnotism" is quite real.

41:49.966 --> 41:52.715
- You know the man?
- No.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.680
But I knew an interested disciple...

41:57.932 --> 42:00.601
one who sought relief
from an incurable ill.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.595
Were they cured?

42:06.065 --> 42:09.314
- I say, were they cured?
- I think not.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.737
You don't seem certain.

42:11.738 --> 42:15.240
At any rate,
hypnotism's effect on memory

42:15.241 --> 42:18.160
interests me more than
its curative powers.

42:18.786 --> 42:24.243
Through it, one is able to call
to mind things long forgotten...

42:25.460 --> 42:31.008
or to forget things...
best not called to mind.

42:32.216 --> 42:35.465
And might we see a demonstration?

42:40.516 --> 42:42.851
Remember, I can't effect
the sale of the abbey

42:42.852 --> 42:44.770
until something more is done.

42:44.771 --> 42:50.853
You see, legally, Ligeia
is still alive, still your wife.

42:50.860 --> 42:53.734
I await your pleasure, sir.

42:54.530 --> 42:57.532
Christopher, I must talk to you.

42:57.533 --> 43:01.620
Since last night, until moments before
you arrived, I had not seen Verden.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.080
And something else,
something horrible...

43:03.081 --> 43:03.955
Rowena.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.999
We mustn't keep our guests waiting.

43:06.459 --> 43:11.130
This is a very pleasant surprise.
Is Lady Rowena going to assist you?

43:11.131 --> 43:14.379
Would you mind,
my dear, assisting me?

43:15.259 --> 43:17.837
- No.
- Sit down.

43:20.348 --> 43:23.392
Kenrick, put out the candles!

43:25.228 --> 43:28.271
Milord, I shall need
your assistance too.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.725
- But...
- Please.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.275
Doctor.

43:35.279 --> 43:37.481
Christopher.

43:40.701 --> 43:43.780
Now, Rowena, just one thing...

43:43.788 --> 43:46.832
What do you remember of your mother?

43:47.792 --> 43:50.871
Well, nothing really,
other than portraits.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.088
She died when I was three.

43:55.967 --> 43:59.636
- Now, my dear...
- I missed you last night.

43:59.637 --> 44:03.637
You had but to come to me.
I never left my room.

44:05.226 --> 44:07.428
Rowena...

44:08.229 --> 44:11.273
you must trust me.

44:11.274 --> 44:14.318
Give over your will to mine.

44:15.194 --> 44:19.865
No harm...
No harm will come to you.

44:21.450 --> 44:24.620
Give over your will to mine.

44:28.332 --> 44:32.662
Your hands are melting into mine.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.872
Soon, very soon,

44:34.922 --> 44:37.750
they will be one with mine.

44:39.010 --> 44:43.056
You will try, but you
will not be able to...

44:43.097 --> 44:47.177
You will try soon...
You will try soon...

44:47.810 --> 44:54.268
You will try now, but you will not,
you cannot move them.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.814
Close your eyes.

45:03.659 --> 45:05.861
Rowena...

45:06.454 --> 45:11.410
- Yes?
- You may let loose of my hands now.

45:13.169 --> 45:18.215
Rowena, you wish to let
loose of my hands now,

45:18.216 --> 45:23.138
because when you do it, it will make
you very happy... Very young...

45:24.138 --> 45:26.306
So young...

45:27.475 --> 45:33.021
All brightness, and butterflies
are a wonder to behold.

45:33.022 --> 45:36.316
- See them? See them?
- Yes.

45:36.317 --> 45:41.444
There is one resting on a rosebush,
one whose wings you can almost touch.

45:41.447 --> 45:46.995
Reach out, Rowena. Touch those wings.
You can almost... No, it flew away.

45:48.246 --> 45:51.039
No tears, Rowena.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.619
There is no need to weep.

45:54.627 --> 45:57.455
Your mother is coming.

45:58.422 --> 46:01.216
Can you see her?

46:02.969 --> 46:04.803
What is she doing?

46:04.804 --> 46:10.056
What does your mother usually do
when you are about to cry, Rowena?

46:11.060 --> 46:14.229
She sings to me.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.314
She sings to you.

46:16.315 --> 46:21.237
What does she sing, Rowena?
Sing it for us.

46:22.697 --> 46:26.151
I have a bonnet trimmed with blue.

46:27.034 --> 46:30.579
Do you wear it? Yes, I do.

46:31.414 --> 46:39.499
I will wear it when I can.
Going to the ball with my young man.

46:46.637 --> 46:52.219
I have a bonnet trimmed with blue.
Do you wear it? Yes, I do.

46:52.268 --> 46:55.813
I will... What a...?

46:56.772 --> 46:58.974
Where...?

47:01.360 --> 47:08.239
Who knoweth the mysteries of the will?
The will herein lieth which dieth not.

47:08.242 --> 47:12.662
Man need not kneel before the angels.
Nor lie in death forever,

47:12.663 --> 47:15.707
but for the weakness
of his feeble will.

47:18.210 --> 47:22.165
I will always be your wife.

47:23.841 --> 47:26.043
Kenrick, the lights.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.724
Is it all over?

47:32.850 --> 47:35.849
Oh, I'm so sleepy.

47:42.276 --> 47:45.320
She'll rest more easily now.

47:45.321 --> 47:48.448
I confess, I am somewhat confounded
by what I have just seen.

47:48.449 --> 47:49.616
Yes.

47:49.617 --> 47:51.076
Should you require my
further assistance...

47:51.077 --> 47:52.702
Yes, thank you, Doctor.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.905
- Good night.
- Good night.

48:01.170 --> 48:05.967
Don't go. Please,
don't leave me tonight.

48:07.927 --> 48:12.928
- You need rest.
- But there are things I must ask you.

48:12.932 --> 48:13.765
Tell you.

48:13.766 --> 48:17.516
Hush, my dear.
Tomorrow will be soon enough.

48:18.896 --> 48:22.225
- Should you need me I'll be in my room.
- But, Verden, I...

48:22.233 --> 48:25.562
Good night, my dear. Good night.

53:14.441 --> 53:15.608
I...

53:17.069 --> 53:18.861
Some things appeared in my room:

53:18.862 --> 53:23.158
a dead fox, a saucer
of milk... Verden?

53:25.869 --> 53:29.369
- Yes?
- Where have you been?

53:31.166 --> 53:33.368
Alone.

53:35.295 --> 53:39.590
- I was alone.
- But where?

53:39.591 --> 53:41.793
Walking.

53:43.095 --> 53:46.424
I woke, dressed and...

53:46.432 --> 53:50.307
walked. I was resting.

53:50.728 --> 53:52.930
Verden, for whom...?

53:53.856 --> 53:56.899
Why have you got that food?

53:56.900 --> 54:00.320
- Why?
- Sir...

54:00.362 --> 54:02.530
- Yes?
- I thought I heard...

54:02.531 --> 54:06.242
Kenrick, can you explain
this plate of food?

54:06.243 --> 54:07.618
I, sir?

54:07.619 --> 54:10.997
Yes. I seem to have found
it outside of my room.

54:10.998 --> 54:12.540
Well?

54:12.541 --> 54:17.497
Perhaps one of the maids
may have mislaid it, sir.

54:17.838 --> 54:23.090
One of the maids?
Yes, well... look into it.

54:23.093 --> 54:25.295
Yes, sir.

54:26.805 --> 54:28.803
Oh, and...

54:29.475 --> 54:34.727
Kenrick, the Lady
Rowena found some...

54:34.772 --> 54:38.647
some things in her room.
Have them removed.

54:38.650 --> 54:41.277
I'll join you at breakfast, my dear.

54:41.278 --> 54:44.823
In the meanwhile... rest.

54:52.080 --> 54:56.251
Ma'am, please show me
what has disturbed you.

55:15.062 --> 55:19.733
I shan't be able to show
you what has disturbed me.

55:20.442 --> 55:22.565
Perhaps you could show me.

55:23.612 --> 55:26.406
I'm truly sorry, ma'am.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.405
I sleep alone,

55:29.993 --> 55:32.366
I eat alone.

55:33.288 --> 55:38.540
And that's as it should be.
After all, I'm not his wife. Am I?

55:39.628 --> 55:42.957
It's a... a legal technicality.

55:42.965 --> 55:48.261
Is it now? Along with the fox,
the food, the saucer of milk,

55:48.262 --> 55:52.012
my hairbrush filled with
black hair, with hers.

55:52.057 --> 55:54.559
Are they just legal
technicalities as well?

55:54.560 --> 55:58.230
But you said yourself that
these objects disappeared.

55:58.564 --> 56:01.065
Someone else besides
myself was there.

56:01.066 --> 56:04.443
Christopher, did you imagine
her words on my lips last night?

56:04.444 --> 56:07.898
- Words I have never heard before!
- No.

56:07.906 --> 56:11.409
That woman is alive. There.

56:11.410 --> 56:15.535
From somewhere in the abbey,
she comes to devil me, destroy me.

56:15.581 --> 56:20.878
Somewhere in the abbey, her abbey,
she's alive, and with her husband.

56:29.469 --> 56:32.343
Let's walk for a bit, my dear.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.970
Make me a promise.

56:38.729 --> 56:44.561
Don't ask for explanations. We must
be in a position to demand them.

56:44.568 --> 56:47.647
By tonight, we will be.

56:47.654 --> 56:49.777
Promise.

57:52.844 --> 57:55.046
Ma'am!

57:58.141 --> 58:01.390
Is there something else
I can fetch you, ma'am?

58:02.312 --> 58:04.355
Just my husband, Kenrick.

58:16.702 --> 58:19.120
I'm sorry to come
upon you unannounced.

58:19.121 --> 58:21.914
You always did stand on ceremony.

58:21.915 --> 58:25.289
Yes. Yes, quite.

58:25.293 --> 58:27.495
May I?

58:27.546 --> 58:30.374
Oh, don't leave us, please.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.128
- Kenrick...
- Sir?

58:35.137 --> 58:37.385
Where is your master?

58:37.973 --> 58:43.725
As I've told Lady Rowena, sir,
he's working over some ancient treasure.

58:43.770 --> 58:47.481
In his study? Splendid.
Then send for him.

58:47.482 --> 58:49.525
He's not there, sir.

58:49.609 --> 58:52.437
Where else might he work?

58:55.157 --> 58:59.783
- I say, where else might he work?
- I can't quite say, sir.

58:59.786 --> 59:02.830
You can't say or you won't say.
Which is it?

59:06.626 --> 59:09.670
Now sit! Go on, sit!

59:14.718 --> 59:20.514
If, Kenrick, you are unsure
of your master's whereabouts,

59:20.515 --> 59:23.059
perhaps you could answer
another question?

59:23.060 --> 59:24.261
Yes, sir?

59:25.604 --> 59:27.806
Where is Ligeia?

59:31.610 --> 59:34.859
I'd have thought the answer
to that an obvious one.

59:34.863 --> 59:40.615
She's lying beneath a white stone
and a carpet of pretty, red flowers.

59:41.536 --> 59:43.579
Isn't that the case, Kenrick?

59:43.580 --> 59:46.832
Of course, sir.
It was only that... that...

59:46.833 --> 59:51.128
- Yes?
- It was such a strange question to ask.

59:51.129 --> 59:53.331
Oh, quite.

59:53.965 --> 59:56.167
Yes, quite.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:03.846
Why do you suppose I should
ask so strange a question?

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:07.930
- I... I...
- Go on, man, speak up!

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:12.058
Perhaps...

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:18.614
Perhaps the Lady Ligeia has wearied
of her final resting place.

01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.408
Perhaps she prefers
the company of Verden

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:24.863
to the dubious comforts
of her coffin.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:28.788
Or perhaps... Look at me!

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:33.963
- Perhaps she has never left his side!
- No, no, no sir!

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:39.671
Well perhaps we shall have to
look into Ligeia's grave? And see...

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.889
Please, sir, no more. Please.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.260
I've no wish to torment you.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:52.433
Produce your master or point
the way for me to find him.

01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:01.241
Give me leave, sir.
You must give me leave.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.247
My dear, go to your room.
Lock the door.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.541
In no circumstances
leave it until I return.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:14.747
- But if Verden comes...
- I can't promise that all will be well.

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:17.582
But it will be done with. Soon.

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:32.352
- Have you another spade?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.037
Ma'am...

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:57.964
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
These want water.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:01.005
I'll take them. Thank you.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:08.016
- Anything else, ma'am?
- No. No. Thank you.

01:02:08.475 --> 01:02:10.473
Night, ma'am.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.760
- That will do.
- Right, sir.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.476
You've earned your ale tonight.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.723
It's wax!

01:06:37.744 --> 01:06:41.244
You must hurry, sir.
He's beyond my help now.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.921
Verden?

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.130
Verden!

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:43.160
It's no use, Rowena.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:46.872
He's beyond any of us now,
beyond any shock.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:50.334
Come with us now, Rowena.
He'll come alone when he can.

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:55.666
It's not his doing, ma'am.
It's hers! Hers! The Lady Ligeia's!

01:08:55.673 --> 01:08:57.170
Her eyes!

01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:59.134
Before she died,
she held him with her eyes

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.837
the way he did with you that night.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:04.470
She told him she was
not dying, would never die,

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.392
but would remain
here waiting for him,

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:09.935
and every night, he must
come and care for her.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:14.441
Be with her. And during the
day he must forget the nights.

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:15.859
And he would forget.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:18.987
And yet, sometimes, I've seen
him struggle to remember,

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.531
struggle against her madness,

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:23.658
But the night always fell.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.830
And with it her madness
always fell upon him.

01:09:27.162 --> 01:09:30.367
And did you never try to tell him?

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:34.879
When I tried,
he became still, like now.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:40.715
He wouldn't see, wouldn't listen.
He's still held by her word.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:45.389
Only she can release him,
and she's dead.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.680
Verden...

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:04.618
Verden, you must trust me.
Give over your will to mine.

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:11.534
Soon, very soon, you will see
standing before you Ligeia.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.708
Look at me, Verden.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.999
I am Ligeia.

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:22.460
Look at me now...

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:26.005
and listen...

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:28.215
and remember.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:31.476
Remember everything.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:35.272
Remember all I've ever asked of you,

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.942
and when you do remember,
you will be free.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:41.771
My will fails me, Verden.

01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:45.900
I am dying, Verden.

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.455
I am dying...

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:57.120
and when I do...

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:00.502
you will see me dead...

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:05.962
and remember it all...

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:10.675
all...

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:15.475
all.

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:39.746
It's too late, Christopher.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.422
She wants a place to rest.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.349
Please...

01:12:38.271 --> 01:12:41.224
leave me alone with my wife.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.014
Verden...

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.975
Verden...

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.199
Verden!

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.164
Verden!

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:46.826
So you murdered her after all.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:49.753
Yes, she killed Rowena
and I killed Ligeia.

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:53.299
But that's Rowena's body!
It's Rowena!

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.335
But it was Ligeia.

01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.592
It was Ligeia!

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.850
Yes, Christopher,
take her and leave.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:06.975
Think me mad, think whatever
you will, but leave this abbey now!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:10.934
I know who is responsible!
Take Rowena out of here!

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.538
Hello, Christopher.
