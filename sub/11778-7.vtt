07:40.626 --> 07:43.045

07:43.129 --> 07:44.881

A TRIPLE SEVEN WITH THE SPADES

07:54.056 --> 07:55.641

FOR THE BAD LUCK ONE.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.393

ARE A LITTLE BIT OFF.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.437
THEY'RE JUST
A STRANGE-LOOKING SEVEN.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.564

KIND OF WITCHY WOMAN,

08:10.031 --> 08:12.533

BROKEN MIRROR, MURDERED SKULL.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.243
- IT'S HARD TO READ.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.330
JUST SEEING THE OUTLINES, IT'S
GOT A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE.

08:17.413 --> 08:18.289
- JOEY.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.415
- I LIKE THE FACT
THAT THE SEVEN

08:19.498 --> 08:20.958
IS THE OBVIOUS
GOOD LUCK CHOICE

08:21.042 --> 08:23.252
BUT IT ALSO STILL
IS MORE DARK AND CREEPY.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.296
WITH THE SKULL BEING
INSIDE THE SEVEN THERE,

08:25.379 --> 08:28.883
YOU COULD STILL SHADE IT
AND GIVE IT THE DIMENSION.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.967
- WHAT'S UP, JASON?

08:30.051 --> 08:30.843

08:30.927 --> 08:31.928
- YES.
- FOR A OUIJA BOARD.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.846
- YES, I DO.
- AND I THOUGHT THAT'S

08:33.929 --> 08:35.097
A REALLY COOL IDEA
FOR SOMETHING LIKE A BAD LUCK,

08:35.181 --> 08:37.015
SO I PUT THE ALL-SEEING EYE
IN THERE.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.851
AND THEN I DID
A LITTLE ASIAN-THEMED THING

08:38.934 --> 08:40.061
FOR GOOD LUCK.

08:40.144 --> 08:41.938
- SINCERELY, I DO LIKE
THE PLANCHETTE DESIGN.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.566
YOU PAID ATTENTION TO SOME
THINGS THAT I'M INTERESTED IN.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.776
JACKIE.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
- THESE ARE GOOD LUCK ONES.
- A BROKEN WISHBONE?

08:49.195 --> 08:51.280
- AND THEN, LIKE, A 13.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.240
I DIDN'T NECESSARILY
FINISH SHADING,

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
BUT IT HAS
THE UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.202
- I LIKE THE SEVEN
AND THE RABBIT'S FOOT.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.120
ONCE AGAIN, IT'S A DESIGN
THAT COULD EASILY

08:58.204 --> 08:59.956

25:10.342 --> 25:11.426
THE SLIGHTEST LITTLE JIGGLE,
AND MY ARCHES

25:11.509 --> 25:14.721
ARE GETTING FURTHER
AND FURTHER AWAY

25:14.804 --> 25:15.222
FROM WHAT THEY SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

25:15.305 --> 25:18.016
- OH, MY JESUS!

25:18.099 --> 25:19.434
- I COULD KICK JASON RIGHT
IN HIS NUTS RIGHT NOW.

25:19.517 --> 25:24.397
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT,
SEVEN, SIX,

25:24.481 --> 25:30.862
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.863
THAT'S IT.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.240
TIME'S UP, MACHINES DOWN.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.201
NO MORE INK.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.828
- OH, MY GOD.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.248
IT LOOKS GOOD.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.125
- WOW.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.543
- TATU BABY HAS REALLY DROPPED
THE BALL ON THIS PIECE.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.338
HERE SHE IS DOING
SOME SORT OF CARTOONY,

25:48.421 --> 25:49.923
WEIRD VERSION
OF THESE STATUES.

25:50.006 --> 25:53.468
THESE ARE ROCK FORMATIONS,
AND THEY LOOK LIKE CARTOONS.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.679
I THINK SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.599
{\an8}HEY, THE WEAK NEED TO FALL OFF,
AND YOU GOT [bleep].

25:59.683 --> 26:02.852
- THIS WAS
A [bleep] TERRIBLE TATTOO.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.145
- YOU SCREWED YOURSELF.
- JUST UNACCEPTABLE.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.731
- IT WAS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK.
- CRYBABY.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.488
- DUDE.

26:13.571 --> 26:15.156
HOW DO I GIVE YOU A DRAGON,
AND YOU TURN ME

26:15.240 --> 26:17.242
INTO A COLOSSEUM
THE VERY NEXT CHALLENGE?

26:17.325 --> 26:18.535
I FEEL REALLY BETRAYED.

26:18.618 --> 26:20.745
JASON PUT ME RIGHT OUT
TO THE WOLVES.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.081
AS SOON AS HE GOT A CHANCE
TO THROW PEOPLE AROUND,

26:23.164 --> 26:23.832
HE'S DOING IT.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.667
- I WANTED TO STIR THE POT.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.961
EVERYBODY NEEDS
TO GET TESTED RIGHT NOW.

26:28.044 --> 26:28.503
- I'M LIVID.
I LOOKED OUT FOR YOU.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.505
- I KNOW THAT.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.881
- BUT YOU TRIED TO [bleep] ME
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.384
- EVERY CHALLENGE UP THERE
WAS DIFFICULT.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.719
- NO, BUT THE POINT IS

26:35.802 --> 26:37.345
THAT HE THINKS
THAT YOU [bleep] HIM OVER.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.847
- RIGHT.
- COLOSSEUM?

26:38.930 --> 26:41.725
- HOW IN THE HELL WOULD I KNOW
WHAT KYLE WANTED TO DO?

26:41.808 --> 26:44.019
- HE'S TRYING TO TALK
HIS WAY OUT OF IT.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.395
- TALK MY WAY OUT OF WHAT?

26:45.478 --> 26:46.855
- IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
TO TATTOO THAT IN SIX HOURS.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.940
- THERE WAS A LITTLE
MALICIOUSNESS GOING ON THERE.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.859
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO I HAND WHAT.

26:50.942 --> 26:54.654
NOT ONE OF THESE MOTHER[bleep]
THINGS WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO DO.

26:54.738 --> 26:55.905
- BUT IF I END UP
GOING HOME FROM IT,

26:55.989 --> 26:56.865
THEN WHAT THE [bleep]?
I MEAN--

26:56.948 --> 26:58.199
- HEY, THE WEAK NEED
TO FALL OFF.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.161
WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO THE WIRE,
AND YOU GOT [bleep].

27:01.244 --> 27:03.663
- IT'S GAME ON.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.336
{\an8}[rock music]

27:09.419 --> 27:17.302
{\an8}♪ ♪

27:20.013 --> 27:21.514
- THIS WEEK,
WE ASKED YOU TO USE

27:21.598 --> 27:24.601
DIMENSION TO TATTOO
A RECOGNIZABLE LANDMARK.

27:24.684 --> 27:28.104
CRAIG, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.566
- AT FIRST GLANCE,
I LIKE THE TATTOO.

27:31.649 --> 27:32.901
YOU HAVE NICE DARKS IN IT,
AND IT JUST READ WELL.

27:32.984 --> 27:35.445
I DO THINK THAT IT'S MISSING
THE BACKGROUND.

27:35.528 --> 27:36.738
IT'S THE LEANING TOWER.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.740
THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
REPRESENTED IN THE TATTOO.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.076
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE
A HANDHELD OBJECT.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.912
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS
TATTOO THAT MAKES IT LOOK LIKE

27:43.995 --> 27:45.330
IT'S A BUILDING
PLANTED IN THE GROUND.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.916
- LAST WEEK, IT WAS A DIFFICULT
BACKGROUND WEEK FOR ME.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.000
THIS WEEK,
I DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE

27:49.084 --> 27:51.419
WITH EVEN ATTEMPTING
TO DO A BACKGROUND.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.712
- I DIDN'T EVER WANT YOU
TO JUST SAY,

27:52.796 --> 27:54.923
"OKAY, I GIVE UP.
I'M NEVER DOING BACKGROUNDS."

27:55.006 --> 27:56.591
- I WASN'T GONNA
LET MYSELF DO IT.

27:56.674 --> 27:58.426
- I WOULD BE WAY MORE IMPRESSED
WITH SOMEONE

27:58.510 --> 27:59.761
WHO STRUGGLED WITH
THE BACKGROUND AND CAME BACK

27:59.844 --> 28:01.930
AND ACHIEVED THE PERFECT AMOUNT
OF BACKGROUND

28:02.013 --> 28:06.768
MORE THAN SOMEONE THAT ABANDONED
BACKGROUND ALTOGETHER.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.896
- JACKIE.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.231
- THIS GUY'S GOT
THIS BIG TATTOO

28:11.314 --> 28:12.774
ON HIS ARM
THAT'S THE EASTER ISLAND GUYS.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.526
THE BIG FACE--
IT TAKES A MINUTE

28:14.609 --> 28:15.485
TO, LIKE, ADJUST TO IT
AND BE LIKE,

28:15.568 --> 28:16.653
"OH, OKAY,
NOW I SEE WHAT IT IS."

28:16.736 --> 28:17.987
- WITH THE PHOTO,
I WISH

28:18.071 --> 28:20.115
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE ONE
WITH THE MOSS PATTERNS.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.449
- THE TWO HEADS
IN THE BACKGROUND

28:21.533 --> 28:23.118
ARE THE BEST PART OF THE TATTOO.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.495
THE FOREGROUND, IT'S JUST HARD
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

28:25.578 --> 28:28.790
YOU DID WAY TOO MUCH PATTERN
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.293
- JIME.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.045
- GOOD LUCK, JIME.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.213
- DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS
WAS JASON'S ATTEMPT

28:35.296 --> 28:37.632
AT THROWING YOU UNDER THE BUS?
- COMPLETELY.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.301
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I'VE SHOWN MY POTENTIAL.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.469
- OH, MAN.
- JASON?

28:41.553 --> 28:43.138
- "I'VE BEEN AT THE TOP
OF EVERY CHALLENGE,

28:43.221 --> 28:44.889
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE I GOT
TO DO ANYTHING GOOD HERE."

28:44.973 --> 28:47.642
HE GOT TO DO A CARTOON ALREADY.
CRYBABY.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.227
- IF YOU WIN
A FLASH CHALLENGE,

28:49.310 --> 28:52.480
ARE YOU GONNA JUST THROW JASON
COMPLETELY UNDER THE BUS?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.649
- I'M BEING A BUS DRIVER.

28:54.732 --> 28:56.651
I'M [bleep] EVERYBODY.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:56.734 --> 28:58.862
LET'S HEAR FROM THE JUDGES.

28:58.945 --> 29:01.823
- MAN, THE DIFFERENCE
FROM THAT PHOTO TO THE TATTOO--

29:01.906 --> 29:06.161
THE PHOTO IS SO DYNAMIC, AND THE
TATTOO IS A LITTLE LACKLUSTER.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.370
- YOU COULD HAVE MADE
THAT BACKGROUND DEEP.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.038
YOU COULD HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN US
THE SENSE OF THE WHOLE.

29:09.122 --> 29:12.500
THE BLACK THAT YOU'RE LACKING
IN THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED

29:12.584 --> 29:13.376
THE WHOLE LOOK OF THIS TATTOO.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.503
IT WAS DIMENSION DAY.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.006
YOU COULD HAVE GOT
WAY MORE DIMENSION.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.842
- JOEY.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.013
- MAN, THIS IS
A [bleep] NICE TATTOO.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.432
A LOT OF THE DETAIL IN THIS
IS SUGGESTIVE,

29:27.515 --> 29:28.308
AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT IT.

29:28.391 --> 29:29.601
A LOT OF LITTLE TRICKS
IN THERE

29:29.684 --> 29:31.352
TO SUGGEST ALL THOSE BEAMS

29:31.436 --> 29:32.854
WITHOUT ACTUALLY OUTLINING
EVERY SINGLE BEAM.

29:32.937 --> 29:34.856
- THE DARKNESS
AND THE RICHNESS IN THIS

29:34.939 --> 29:37.442
REALLY GIVES YOU
THE SENSE OF DIMENSION.

29:37.525 --> 29:41.321
GREAT JOB, MAN.
IT'S GOOD TO SEE SOMEBODY SHINE.

29:42.530 --> 29:45.241
- E.S.

29:46.534 --> 29:47.660
- THE PICTURE IS,

29:47.744 --> 29:48.786
YOU KNOW, A GOOD PICTURE
TO CHOOSE, LIKE, AS FAR AS

29:48.870 --> 29:51.706
PERSPECTIVE AND THE WAY
IT FITS THE ARM.

29:51.789 --> 29:55.043
WITH SO MUCH LINE WORK,
THERE SHOULD BE DIFFERENT SIZES.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.461
EVERYTHING'S EQUALLY
THE SAME THICKNESS,

29:56.544 --> 29:58.880
AND IT KIND OF LOSES ITSELF.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.049
- HAD YOU HAVE USED
A THIN LINER

30:01.132 --> 30:03.009
AND DONE
THOSE BRIDGE LINES LIGHTLY,

30:03.092 --> 30:04.552
IT WOULDN'T LOOK AS SIMILAR.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.720
EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME.

30:05.803 --> 30:08.056
THAT'S WHERE JOEY
DID EVERYTHING

30:08.139 --> 30:10.558
SO TINY AND FINE
AND THEN HAD THOSE HEAVY AREAS.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.560
IT'S NIGHT AND DAY.
- TWO DIFFERENT BRIDGES, THOUGH,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.020
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,

30:14.103 --> 30:15.396
HAVING TO GO APPLES TO APPLES,

30:15.480 --> 30:19.359
YOURS VERSUS HIS,
YOU SEE THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.237
- KYLE.

30:24.822 --> 30:26.282
- OVERALL, THE STRUCTURE
OF THE ENTIRE THING,

30:26.366 --> 30:29.077
IT'S VERY NICE.
IN EACH LITTLE WINDOW, DOORWAY,

30:29.160 --> 30:30.328
YOU HAVE THOSE DROP SHADOWS
GOING BACK,

30:30.411 --> 30:32.872
AND THE SHADE AND THE DIFFERENT
LIGHT COMING THROUGH

30:32.956 --> 30:34.290
THAT GIVES THIS THING
FORCED DIMENSION.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.626
BUT WHEN YOU REALLY GET CLOSE,
THESE SMALL DETAIL LINES

30:36.709 --> 30:38.419
DON'T REALLY SEEM AS CONCENTRIC
AS THEY SHOULD.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.004
- WITH THIS TATTOO,

30:40.088 --> 30:44.175
AS YOU MOVE UP IN THE LEVELS
OF THE COLOSSEUM,

30:44.259 --> 30:45.593
I JUST SEE YOU WEAR OUT.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.387
- MY INABILITY TO WORK
WITH MY CUSTOMER SEEMS

30:47.470 --> 30:48.596
TO BE SOMETHING
I STRUGGLE WITH.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.765
I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHAT JOSH HAS.

30:50.848 --> 30:52.642
HIS ABILITY TO WORK
WITH HIS CANVAS IS AMAZING.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.019
- YOU GOT DEALT A TOUGH CARD,

30:55.103 --> 30:56.437
BUT TO BE IN THE COMPETITION,

30:56.521 --> 30:58.273
GOTTA CLEAN IT UP.

30:58.356 --> 31:01.526
- JOSHUA.

31:01.609 --> 31:02.610
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU WERE

31:02.694 --> 31:05.613
GIVEN THIS CANVAS
BY JASON INTENTIONALLY?

31:05.697 --> 31:07.240
- I MEAN, THE WHOLE GROUP'S KIND
OF SAT DOWN AND SAID, "OH, YEAH.

31:07.323 --> 31:10.118
IT'S NOW A GAME OF GIVING JOSH
WHATEVER WE DON'T UNDERSTAND."

31:10.201 --> 31:13.079
SO I'VE KIND OF SLIPPED INTO
THAT ROLE OF BEING THE BAD GUY.

31:13.162 --> 31:14.622
- THE DIFFERENCE HERE, BRO,
IS I WANT A HEALTHY COMPETITION.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.207
I'M JUST TRYING
TO STIR THE POT.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.752
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, DO
[bleep] OUT OF MALICIOUS INTENT.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.546
- SO NOW YOU SEE
WHAT I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH.

31:21.629 --> 31:23.923
- THIS IS PROBABLY
THE BEST CANVAS FOR YOU.

31:24.007 --> 31:25.967
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
OUTLINE-INTENSIVE DESIGNS.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.012
YOU'VE SHOWN YOUR STRENGTH
IN OUTLINING

31:29.095 --> 31:30.305
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.889
BUT WHERE'S THE CONTRAST?

31:31.973 --> 31:34.517
WHERE'S THE DARK SHADOW?
WHERE'S THE DEPTH?

31:34.601 --> 31:38.062
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF SOLID AREA
OF THIS LIGHT GRAY COLOR.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.314
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SHADING.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.984
YOU MISSED THE MARK OF THE DAY,
WHICH IS DIMENSION.

31:46.821 --> 31:49.157
- JASON.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.492
- I FEEL LIKE YOU GOT
A LITTLE BIT SMOOTHER HERE

31:51.576 --> 31:53.703
THAN WE'VE SEEN YOU IN THE PAST,
BUT THE BIG THING THAT BUGS ME

31:53.786 --> 31:54.829
ABOUT THIS TATTOO IS

31:54.912 --> 31:55.663
THERE'S A COUPLE AREAS
ON THE PHOTO

31:55.747 --> 31:58.875
WHERE IT GOES TO SOLID BLACK,

31:58.958 --> 32:00.126
LIKE THE BACK OF HER HAIR,

32:00.209 --> 32:01.252
UNDERNEATH HER HAND
ON THE TABLET,

32:01.336 --> 32:03.963
THE ARM THAT'S OUTREACHED
WITH THE TORCH.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.840
IF YOU WOULD HAVE COPIED
THOSE SOLID BLACK AREAS,

32:05.923 --> 32:07.842
IT WOULD'VE HELPED
GIVE THIS THING

32:07.925 --> 32:09.344
THE DIMENSION
IT WAS LOOKING FOR.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.763
- I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END UP
TOO SOLID AND TOO LIGHT.

32:11.846 --> 32:14.557
- USING ALL THE DIFFERENT TONES
OF GRAY

32:14.641 --> 32:15.725
AND NOT COMMITTING
TO THE BLACK

32:15.808 --> 32:18.102
IN THIS PARTICULAR TATTOO
ACTUALLY HURT YOU.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.816
- TATU BABY.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.443
- I DO LIKE THE SHAPE
OF THIS TATTOO,

32:25.526 --> 32:26.861
THE WAY IT FITS THE SIDE
OF THE LEG.

32:26.944 --> 32:27.904
I LIKE THE FLAG.
THE COLOR WORK IS AWESOME.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.822
BUT YOU LOSE IT
IN THE FACES.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.407
ON ONE SIDE OF LINCOLN'S FACE,

32:31.491 --> 32:34.118
IT WOULD BE DARKER, AND YOU HAVE
WHITE ON BOTH EYELIDS.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.704
THAT MAKES IT UNREALISTIC.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.374
- THAT RICH BLACK SILHOUETTE
OF LINCOLN'S FACE CARRYING OVER

32:39.457 --> 32:42.585
TO THE OTHER FACE IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED IN THIS.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.961
IT WOULD HAVE MADE
THE COLOR POP.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.713
IT WOULD'VE MADE EVERYTHING LOOK
SO MUCH BETTER.

32:45.797 --> 32:48.758
YOU INVENTED A HALF A PORTRAIT
FOR NOTHING.

32:48.841 --> 32:51.010
YOU SCREWED YOURSELF
ON THIS ONE.

32:53.554 --> 32:55.014
- OKAY, ARTISTS.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.225
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

32:57.308 --> 33:00.561
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.814
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:02.897 --> 33:06.317
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.201
- YOU AND I
HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.244
- RIGHT.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.704
- YOU'RE
AN IRRITATING MOTHER[bleep],

33:17.787 --> 33:19.789
BUT AS FAR AS THE WAY
YOU'RE PLAYING THE GAME,

33:19.872 --> 33:21.290
JASON JUST DID
THE SAME [bleep] THING.

33:21.374 --> 33:22.583
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
THE WHOLE TIME.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.419
YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DO IT.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.753
EVEN JIME SAID THAT
WHENEVER HE GETS HIS NEXT CHANCE

33:25.837 --> 33:28.715
TO DRIVE THE BUS,
HE'S GONNA RUN EVERYBODY OVER.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.134
- WHEN I HEARD THAT, I WAS LIKE,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

33:31.217 --> 33:34.095
- I'VE BEEN BAFFLED,
WATCHING EVERYBODY JUST

33:34.178 --> 33:37.140
COMPLIMENT EACH OTHER AND HOLD
EACH OTHER'S HANDS AND KUMBAYA.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.433
WHEN YOU'RE IN A FIGHT,
YOU DON'T TRAIN

33:38.516 --> 33:39.892
WITH THE GUY YOU'RE FIGHTING.
- NO.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.936
IT'S CHANGING
THE WAY I SEE THE GAME.

33:42.019 --> 33:43.312
I'M BEGINNING TO SEE EVERYTHING
THAT THEY'VE--

33:43.396 --> 33:44.856
AND EVEN I--
HAVE SAID ABOUT YOU.

33:44.939 --> 33:47.358
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY ON THAT.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.484
- I DO REALLY
APPRECIATE IT, MAN.

33:48.568 --> 33:49.652
- STILL PLAYING THE GAME
IF I CAN.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.028
- FOR SURE.
- I'M GONNA DO THE SAME [bleep],

33:51.112 --> 33:52.238
BUT NOW I'VE GOT
DIFFERENT TARGETS.

33:52.321 --> 33:54.115
{\an8}- DEFINITELY.
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT KYLE

33:54.198 --> 33:57.118
{\an8}GIVES ME CREDIT FOR ACTUALLY
PLAYING THE GAME.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.245
BUT THIS IS A COMPETITION,
AND IF THAT'S A PERSON,

33:59.328 --> 34:01.873
YOU'VE STILL GOT TO SHOOT THEM
IN THE [bleep] HEAD.

34:01.956 --> 34:05.126
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT
IS THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON HERE

34:05.209 --> 34:09.505
IS TRYING TO STEAL $100,000
FROM ME THAT'S ALREADY MINE.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.382
I ALREADY HAVE DESTINED
TO HAVE THAT MONEY,

34:11.466 --> 34:13.384
AND THEY'RE TRYING
TO [bleep] ROB ME.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.137
IT'S LIKE, "GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF MY WAY!"

34:16.219 --> 34:17.847
I NEED THAT MONEY.
I NEED IT.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.139
YOU NEED IT.

34:19.223 --> 34:23.351
- YEAH, I COULD USE $100,000.
[bleep].

34:29.192 --> 34:32.487
- PHOTO-REALISTIC LANDMARKS
AND DIMENSION.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.946
HOW DID OUR FIELD DO OVERALL?

34:34.030 --> 34:35.864
- DIMENSION ALONE
IS A HARD CHALLENGE.

34:35.947 --> 34:37.992
IT'S A LOT
ABOUT THE ARTISTIC EYE.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.661
- I WAS ACTUALLY A FAN
OF THE COLOSSEUM DONE BY KYLE.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.371
GRAPHICALLY,
IT LOOKED COOL.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.373
- THIS LOOKS LIKE WHITE STONE,
'CAUSE IT'S GOT THE DEEP BLACK

34:45.458 --> 34:47.710
AND THE EXTERIOR,
IT'S NOT MUDDIED WITH GRAY.

34:47.793 --> 34:49.712
- I'M ACTUALLY GLAD
HE PUT A LOT MORE DARK

34:49.795 --> 34:52.005
AND NOT MUCH SHADING, 'CAUSE
IT'S READABLE FROM A DISTANCE.

34:52.089 --> 34:54.634
- BUT IT'S NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE
TO JOEY.

34:54.717 --> 34:57.553
IT HAS THE DEEP, RICH CONTRAST
TO GIVE IT DEPTH.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.972
- JUST THE USE OF DARK
WITH THE CONTRAST OF THE LIGHT

35:00.056 --> 35:01.849
REALLY MAKES IT
A STRONG TATTOO.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.476
- OUT OF OUR BOTTOM TATTOOS,

35:03.559 --> 35:05.645
JACKIE'S EASTER ISLAND
IS A MESS.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.854
- WHAT SHE DID IN THE BACKGROUND

35:06.938 --> 35:07.855
WOULD HAVE BEEN
A SAFER PLAY FOR HER

35:07.939 --> 35:09.315
TO JUST DO IT
IN THE FOREGROUND,

35:09.398 --> 35:12.026
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T DO
A TEXTURE, THEN DON'T.

35:12.109 --> 35:14.278
- PERSONALLY, I THINK
E.S. HAD THE WORST DIMENSION.

35:14.362 --> 35:15.363
EVERYTHING FROM THE BACKGROUND
TO FOREGROUND

35:15.446 --> 35:17.532
WAS THE EXACT SAME VALUE.
- JUST BLACK.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.866
BUT NOT EVEN SMOOTH BLACK.
- YOU KNOW?

35:18.950 --> 35:19.867
- I JUST--I HATE IT.

35:19.951 --> 35:20.868
- E.S. HAD POOR DIMENSION
FOR SURE,

35:20.952 --> 35:24.497
BUT JOSHUA'S HAS NO DIMENSION.

35:24.580 --> 35:25.998
- YEAH, JOSHUA'S WAS SUPER FLAT.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.209
THE STATUE THAT WAS UP CLOSE
WAS THE SAME LINE WEIGHT

35:28.292 --> 35:28.835
AS WHAT WAS IN THE BACKGROUND.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.878
- WHO WOULD BE SURPRISED

35:30.962 --> 35:31.963
IF THE HUMAN CANVASES
PICKED JOSHUA?

35:32.046 --> 35:33.506
- I'M SURE IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

35:33.589 --> 35:36.551
- OVER THAT MOUNT RUSHMORE?
- THAT MOUNT RUSHMORE IS UGLY.

35:36.634 --> 35:39.095
- TATU BABY TRIED TO DO
A REALISTIC PORTRAIT,

35:39.178 --> 35:41.222
BUT SHE CREATED THE OTHER HALF
OF THAT FACE.

35:41.305 --> 35:44.100
- THE WHITE IN THE EYES
IS THE ONE THING

35:44.183 --> 35:46.060
THAT'S TAKING MY BRAIN AWAY
FROM THINKING

35:46.143 --> 35:47.520
THIS IS MADE OUT OF STONE.

35:47.603 --> 35:49.021
- IT'S MY LEAST FAVORITE
OF THE DAY.

35:49.105 --> 35:49.730
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WELL, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

35:49.814 --> 35:51.941
THAT WE HAVE A DECISION.

35:52.024 --> 35:53.442
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
THIS IS IT.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.486
{\an8}WE'RE HERE TO DECIDE WHICH
ARTIST HAS THE WORST TATTOO.

35:55.570 --> 36:01.909
- MY ARTIST WAS JOSHUA, AND WHAT
I WANTED WAS A MAYAN MONUMENT.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.287
- I DON'T SEE MUCH DIMENSION.
- I DO.

36:04.370 --> 36:05.663
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,

36:05.746 --> 36:07.123
'CAUSE I'M ROCKING THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.666
- HONESTLY, AT FIRST GLANCE,

36:08.749 --> 36:11.460
I DIDN'T SEE A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE STATUE AND THE WALL.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.421
IT LOOKED LIKE
IT ALL BLENDED TOGETHER.

36:13.504 --> 36:14.839
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

36:14.922 --> 36:16.632
- I DON'T THINK IT CAPTURES
PHOTO-REALISM AS MUCH.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.259
- HAVE YOU SEEN THE MONUMENT?
- I HAVE NOT.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.927
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE MONUMENT?
- I DON'T KNOW THE MONUMENT.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.637
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

36:21.721 --> 36:25.099
- MY TATTOO ARTIST WAS E.S.,
AND HE GOT THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

36:25.182 --> 36:27.685
- THE CABLES COMING DOWN
ARE KIND OF INCONSISTENT

36:27.768 --> 36:29.270
TOWARDS THE MIDDLE
OF THE BRIDGE.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.522
IT JUST LOOKS KIND OF RANDOM.
- IT JUST--IT'S ALL BLACK.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.441
- THAT'S ALL SHADE
FROM UNDER THE BRIDGE.

36:33.524 --> 36:35.234
- I THINK THE SHADING
IS TOO MUCH.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.152
- TOO MUCH, YEAH.
- IT'S, LIKE, WAY TOO DARK.

36:36.235 --> 36:38.154
- YEAH.
- IT JUST LOOKS FLAT.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.113
- I THINK IT HAS DIMENSION.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.908
- MY TATTOO ARTIST
WAS TATU BABY.

36:41.991 --> 36:42.992
I ASKED FOR MOUNT RUSHMORE.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.494
- WHEN YOU THINK
OF MOUNT RUSHMORE,

36:45.578 --> 36:46.537
YOU SEE ALL FOUR,

36:46.621 --> 36:47.622
NOT JUST THE TWO.
- FOUR, YEAH.

36:47.705 --> 36:48.748
- IS THE GUY'S FACE ON THE LEFT

36:48.831 --> 36:50.082
SUPPOSED TO BE CUT IN HALF?

36:50.166 --> 36:51.792
- IT'S NOT CUT IN HALF.
IT'S THE SHADING.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.127
- IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
A TWO-FACED PERSON.

36:53.210 --> 36:55.171
- I THINK IT LOOKS
JUST LIKE THE PHOTO.

36:55.254 --> 36:55.963
- WAS THERE A FLAG
IN THE PHOTO?

36:56.047 --> 36:58.299
- A LOT OF PEOPLE ADD FLAGS.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.134
- BUT I THINK THE AMOUNT
OF TIME PUT INTO THE FLAG

37:00.217 --> 37:01.177
COULD HAVE BEEN PUT

37:01.260 --> 37:02.803
INTO TWO OTHER FACES.
- YEAH.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.139
- SHE DEFINITELY DON'T BELONG
IN THE BOTTOM, STRAIGHT UP.

37:05.222 --> 37:08.517
- ALL RIGHT, LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE REACHED A VERDICT.

37:12.021 --> 37:15.232
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.026
WE NEED TO SEE JOSHUA...

37:17.109 --> 37:19.904
E.S....

37:19.987 --> 37:22.823
JOEY...

37:22.907 --> 37:25.618
AND TATU BABY.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.535
SEE YOU ALL IN THE SHOP.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.204
- I FEEL SO RELIEVED
RIGHT NOW.

37:28.287 --> 37:29.497
- BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:29.580 --> 37:30.665
YOU LOOK A LITTLE "ANXIETAL."

37:30.748 --> 37:31.791
- ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

37:31.874 --> 37:34.210
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
- GOOD LUCK, GUYS.

37:34.293 --> 37:36.671
- ONE LOVE, Y'ALL.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.889
- TODAY WE TESTED YOUR ABILITY
TO USE DIMENSION

37:46.973 --> 37:49.266
TO TATTOO A FAMILIAR LANDMARK.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.686
ONE OF YOU IMPRESSED US.

37:51.769 --> 37:55.106
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

37:55.189 --> 37:57.817
[dramatic music]

37:57.900 --> 37:59.026
GOES TO JOEY.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.444
- IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.114
YOU REALLY CREATED A LOT
OF DEPTH AND DIMENSION WITH IT.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.616
CONGRATS.
- THANK YOU.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.868
- E.S., TATU BABY, JOSHUA,

38:07.952 --> 38:09.996
YOUR TATTOOS FELL FLAT,

38:10.079 --> 38:12.957
AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE PACKING
YOUR MACHINES.

38:13.040 --> 38:16.085
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY HAD
A VERY DIFFICULT DELIBERATION.

38:16.168 --> 38:19.547
ULTIMATELY, THE JURY VOTED...

38:19.630 --> 38:25.052
THAT TATU BABY HAD
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.887
- THESE FACES,
THEY'RE JUST BAD.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.557
THERE'S NO OTHER WORD OTHER THAN
"UNACCEPTABLE" FOR THIS.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.475
- WHEN I WAS DONE WITH IT,
I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY SATISFIED.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.061
BUT THEN COMING HERE
AND GETTING YOUR CRITIQUE,

38:34.145 --> 38:35.604
I'M JUST REEVALUATING IT
AND LEARNING FROM IT.

38:35.688 --> 38:39.608
- YOU'RE NOT DOING THE THINGS
THAT GOT YOU VOTED BACK.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.068
YOUR HEAD'S ELSEWHERE,
AND UNFORTUNATELY,

38:41.152 --> 38:44.739
IT REALLY SHOWS
ON THIS CLIENT.

38:44.822 --> 38:46.073
- E.S.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.408
- THIS WAS
MY LEAST FAVORITE TATTOO.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.744
I JUST DIDN'T LIKE
HOW IT FADES OFF INTO NOTHING.

38:49.827 --> 38:50.911
- IF I WOULD'VE PUT
SOME CLOUDS BACK THERE,

38:50.995 --> 38:53.205
IT WOULD'VE SMOOTHED OUT
THE WHOLE EFFECT.

38:53.289 --> 38:54.457
- IT'S NOT EVEN ONLY
ABOUT THE BACKGROUND.

38:54.540 --> 38:55.583
IT JUST WASN'T THOUGHT THROUGH,

38:55.666 --> 38:57.084
THE WAY IT WAS
JUST GONNA FADE OFF.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.837
IT JUST WASN'T UP TO PAR.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.256
- JOSHUA.
- YOU DID SUCH A FLAT PIECE.

39:02.339 --> 39:04.050
YOU OVERDID IT
WITH THE OUTLINE,

39:04.133 --> 39:06.260
LEFT YOURSELF NO TIME
TO PUT ANY SHADING IN HERE,

39:06.344 --> 39:07.845
AND TODAY IS DIMENSION DAY.

39:07.928 --> 39:10.097
IT'S A BUMMER THAT SOMEONE
WITH SUCH A TECHNICAL OUTLINE

39:10.181 --> 39:11.307
IS DOWN HERE IN THE BOTTOM.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.433
- I HAVE A FLAT WALL.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.101
LITERALLY, IT WAS
AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.603
- BABY, YOU WERE JUST SHAKING
YOUR HEAD.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.021
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

39:17.104 --> 39:18.105
- I THINK YOU COULD HAVE PUT
DIMENSION INTO THAT PIECE.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.273
- YOU GUYS DO KNOW

39:19.356 --> 39:21.442
THAT I AM THE MOST
TECHNICALLY CAPABLE PERSON

39:21.525 --> 39:24.278
IN THIS COMPETITION,
AND I'M A FEW BAD DECISIONS AWAY

39:24.361 --> 39:25.821
FROM BEING ONE
OF THE BEST ARTISTS HERE.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.281
- I DISAGREE.

39:27.364 --> 39:29.116
YOU'VE BEEN ASKING
FOR CERTAIN THINGS,

39:29.200 --> 39:30.701
AND HE HASN'T GIVEN
THOSE THINGS,

39:30.785 --> 39:32.578
AND HE'S BEEN HERE AT THE BOTTOM
A LOT OF TIMES.

39:32.661 --> 39:35.081
- UPSTAIRS IN THE HOUSE, ALL
HE DOES IS CAUSE PROBLEMS, MAN.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.791
- UP IN THE HOUSE,
ALL I DO IS DEFEND MYSELF

39:36.874 --> 39:37.958
AGAINST
ALL YOUR [bleep] ATTACKS.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.627
- WE DON'T ATTACK YOU.
WE'RE JUST--

39:39.710 --> 39:41.337
- EVERYBODY DOES.
- ALL WE HAVE DONE,

39:41.420 --> 39:42.755
INSTEAD OF TALKING
BEHIND HIS BACK,

39:42.838 --> 39:46.175
IS GIVEN HIM THE RESPECT
TO BE THERE IN FRONT OF US.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.678
- I DON'T BUST OUT EXCUSES.
WHAT KIND OF HONOR IS THAT?

39:51.388 --> 39:54.600
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:59.730 --> 40:03.776
E.S., YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.653
- IT COMES DOWN TO WHICH ONE
OF THESE TATTOOS

40:05.736 --> 40:07.029
HAS THE MOST WEAKNESSES,
AND YOU MADE

40:07.113 --> 40:08.864
SOME WRONG DECISIONS HERE.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.282
- ALL RIGHT, E.S.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.409
PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES.
CLOSE SHOP.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.995
- I THINK THE JUDGES' DECISION
WAS WRONG.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.498
IT'S LIKE A SLAP IN THE FACE.
JOSH SHOULD HAVE WENT HOME.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.167
I CAN DRAW WAY BETTER
THAN THAT KID ANY DAY.

OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:28.467 --> 40:31.804
- YOUR CANVASES THIS WEEK
MIGHT LOOK FAMILIAR.

40:31.887 --> 40:33.097
WELCOME BACK.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.683
- HOLY [bleep].

40:35.766 --> 40:37.852
YOU'RE DEFINITELY ONE PERSON
THAT I DO NOT WANT TO TATTOO.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.229

WHAT I HAD IN MIND!

40:40.312 --> 40:41.230

TO LIKE TO [bleep]

40:41.313 --> 40:42.523
WHILE I'M TATTOOING THEM.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.066
- OH, YEAH,
THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ME.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.527
- YOU TATTOO OFF YOUR EMOTIONS.
I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR WORK.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.820
- YOU HAVE TO BRING
YOUR A-GAME EVERY DAY.

40:47.903 --> 40:48.946
- 'CAUSE NOBODY'S SAFE.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.240
- MY HEART AND HEAD ARE NOT
IN THIS GAME,

40:51.323 --> 40:53.701
AND I HAVE TO GO HOME.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.286
