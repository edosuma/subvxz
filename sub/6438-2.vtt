WEBVTT

00:03.222 --> 00:06.258
Our numbers have grown
beyond wildest expectation.

00:06.326 --> 00:07.826
<i>And winter will soon be upon us.</i>

00:07.894 --> 00:10.962
Resources of the Senate
are drained by these conflicts.

00:11.030 --> 00:13.197
There is one among us

00:13.265 --> 00:15.333
<i>who could fund endeavor</i>
<i>from his own purse.</i>

00:16.568 --> 00:18.569
It would take considerable
coin and effort

00:18.637 --> 00:19.771
to raise such a force.

00:19.838 --> 00:21.873
And in return you will
be offered a command,

00:21.940 --> 00:23.908
<i>under Cossinius and Furius, of course.</i>

00:23.976 --> 00:26.878
I begin to question turning from
the calm of the ocean breeze,

00:26.946 --> 00:30.582
and the safety of my city's
walls in Sinuessa en Valle.

00:30.650 --> 00:31.917
Their terms are agreeable.

00:31.985 --> 00:33.819
Father.

00:33.887 --> 00:36.022
Spartacus, this one carried a message.

00:36.089 --> 00:37.323
You planned this.

00:37.391 --> 00:40.226
<i>It speaks of hope that</i>
<i>word finds them safe</i>

00:40.294 --> 00:43.864
within the villa.

00:46.668 --> 00:48.769
<i>Sole command and charge</i>
<i>to bring Spartacus</i>

00:48.837 --> 00:51.172
to deserved end is now yours.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.507
<i>There isn't a villa in all the land</i>

00:52.575 --> 00:54.576
that could hold such numbers.

00:54.644 --> 00:56.411
No, there is not.

00:56.479 --> 00:58.380
Only a city could hold us now.

01:18.637 --> 01:19.971
Come on, keep it up!

01:35.388 --> 01:38.824
Not as easy as butchering
a horse, is it?

01:44.397 --> 01:48.000
Their kick is considerably more gentle.

01:49.069 --> 01:50.770
Diotimus.

01:50.838 --> 01:53.139
Spartacus summons you.

02:03.217 --> 02:06.153
<i>The southern coast?</i>

02:06.221 --> 02:07.354
It will force Crassus' army

02:07.422 --> 02:10.458
to march much greater
distance to meet us,

02:10.525 --> 02:12.326
<i>sapping strength and supplies.</i>

02:12.394 --> 02:15.363
But will we not stand
as drained at journey's end?

02:15.431 --> 02:18.233
The comfort of city walls
will see us revived.

02:18.300 --> 02:21.036
A thing denied Crassus.

02:21.103 --> 02:22.537
<i>Diotimus.</i>

02:22.605 --> 02:25.741
I would have your counsel.

02:25.809 --> 02:27.109
Apologies...

02:27.177 --> 02:29.980
I am absent knowledge
concerning strategies of war.

02:30.047 --> 02:32.649
Yet you are well versed in other needs.

02:36.988 --> 02:39.624
<i>You spoke of a city protected by walls</i>

02:39.691 --> 02:42.226
and caressed by ocean's breeze.

02:42.294 --> 02:45.062
Ah...Sinuessa en Valle.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.098
Uh, home to me for many years...

02:52.938 --> 02:55.807
Then you know of its defenses.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.843
You would take the city?

02:58.911 --> 03:03.315
Mmm, that path rests upon your words.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.756
There are two gates.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.792
The main one faces
the hills to the west.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.227
Open for trade during light of day,

03:14.294 --> 03:16.429
secured as sun retires.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.698
And the other?

03:18.766 --> 03:20.533
Set against cliffs,

03:20.601 --> 03:23.102
running up to the canyons
of Melia Ridge.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.270
Impassable during winter months,

03:24.338 --> 03:27.940
which are already upon its peak.

03:28.008 --> 03:31.277
I would not find
ourselves trapped there.

03:31.344 --> 03:34.013
Nor I.

03:34.081 --> 03:36.482
How stands the main gate?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.052
Formidable, once sealed.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.820
Could a few men from
within see it opened,

03:40.887 --> 03:42.588
beneath cover of night?

03:42.656 --> 03:48.494
<i>It is well defended,</i>
<i>and you would be absent means.</i>

03:48.562 --> 03:51.130
The Aedile feared weapons
could be turned upon the guards,

03:51.198 --> 03:52.265
ordered all of note

03:52.332 --> 03:56.435
locked within a storeroom near the gate.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.305
We must give up sword upon entering?

04:01.242 --> 04:04.411
Let us turn toward more
favorable prospect.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.281
Hold a moment...

04:07.349 --> 04:09.417
<i>I had dealings with</i>
<i>a man during my travels,</i>

04:09.484 --> 04:12.453
who claimed the city his own.

04:12.521 --> 04:15.324
Attius, a blacksmith by trade.

04:15.391 --> 04:16.791
I know of him.

04:16.860 --> 04:19.027
My dominus often spoke
of his distaste for the man.

04:20.096 --> 04:22.397
Can we lay trust in the Roman?

04:22.465 --> 04:25.734
He stands Roman only by name.

04:25.802 --> 04:28.370
Weigh his purse with enough coin

04:28.438 --> 04:32.708
and he would call Thrace
or Gaul his mother.

04:32.775 --> 04:36.379
I would have you with me to break word.

04:36.446 --> 04:37.913
I would join you.

04:37.981 --> 04:39.915
Break camp and follow.

04:39.983 --> 04:42.885
<i>Remain unseen until called to purpose.</i>

04:42.952 --> 04:44.920
What of your brands?

04:44.988 --> 04:46.155
<i>If you are searched at the gate,</i>

04:46.222 --> 04:48.657
<i>effort will be short lived.</i>

04:48.724 --> 04:50.592
A point well made.

04:50.659 --> 04:54.096
My fucking dominus holds
sway with the Aedile.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.433
Speak the name of Laurus
towards meeting of trade,

04:57.500 --> 05:01.136
stand chance of avoiding entanglement.

05:01.204 --> 05:05.041
The next you greet him,
it will be Laurus who kneels...

05:05.108 --> 05:07.543
and calls you master.

05:12.764 --> 05:15.293
<i>Step forward!</i>

05:15.413 --> 05:17.519
<i>That will do.</i>

05:17.587 --> 05:19.355
Give up weapons.
Any weapons?

05:23.760 --> 05:24.860
Step forward!

05:28.965 --> 05:31.099
<i>State business within Sinuessa en Valle.</i>

05:31.167 --> 05:33.535
We come for grain.

05:33.603 --> 05:38.941
And all the pleasures
your city has to offer...

05:39.009 --> 05:43.579
Ah...you insult me.

05:43.647 --> 05:46.115
By so light a palm.

05:46.183 --> 05:51.921
Well...allow
weighted apology...

05:51.989 --> 05:55.525
I would have your brace,
and the jewels upon it.

05:55.593 --> 05:59.896
It is most treasured
possession at this time.

05:59.964 --> 06:02.365
I would not part with it.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.811
Then turn from fucking gate.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.021
Guards!

06:08.640 --> 06:11.606
As you wish.

06:11.726 --> 06:13.427
Oh, please inform Laurus that...

06:13.495 --> 06:14.628
his guests will not be able

06:14.696 --> 06:16.931
to keep intended meeting, hmmm.

06:16.998 --> 06:18.632
Wait.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.902
Ah, give over weapons.

06:21.970 --> 06:25.639
<i>And grace ear of the man that</i>
<i>Decimus saw you well treated.</i>

06:25.707 --> 06:28.842
Gratitude.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.211
<i>I shall see you well rewarded this day.</i>

06:43.358 --> 06:45.659
<i>I understand your plight, Ulpianus,</i>

06:45.726 --> 06:47.594
<i>but you must understand my husband's.</i>

06:47.662 --> 06:49.563
The Cilicians yet plague our waters

06:49.630 --> 06:52.198
and Spartacus now assaults
transport upon land.

06:52.266 --> 06:53.333
The cost
of grain --

06:53.401 --> 06:54.701
-- soars beyond reason.

06:54.769 --> 06:56.803
If I raise the price of my bread
any further to cover loss,

06:56.871 --> 06:58.471
I-I fear the crowd
will turn upon me.

06:58.539 --> 07:01.408
A matter to be taken up with my husband.

07:02.777 --> 07:05.745
I would not ask if profit
were my only concern, Laeta.

07:05.812 --> 07:07.446
My wife is with child.

07:12.619 --> 07:14.186
I will broach subject with him.

07:14.254 --> 07:15.221
Gratitude.

07:15.288 --> 07:18.791
Hold sentiment until it is deserved.

07:18.859 --> 07:21.828
I do not expect him to be moved.

07:21.895 --> 07:22.935
<i>Three denarii!</i>

07:22.963 --> 07:25.098
<i>Yeah, fresh this morning!</i>

07:31.640 --> 07:32.840
This is the one you spoke of?

07:32.907 --> 07:34.408
It is, Aedile.

07:34.476 --> 07:36.610
I warned you shackle would
not stand warning enough

07:36.678 --> 07:38.412
after Diotimus slipped from grasp.

07:39.481 --> 07:41.148
Words now heeded.

07:41.216 --> 07:42.216
<i>See it done.</i>

07:42.284 --> 07:43.450
<i>And in grim wake,</i>

07:43.518 --> 07:47.955
post notice to quell
further unpleasantness.

07:49.491 --> 07:50.691
This way!

07:50.759 --> 07:54.595
Stand up!

07:54.663 --> 07:56.564
Come on.

07:56.631 --> 07:58.766
Ennius.
<i>Forward.</i>

07:58.833 --> 08:00.267
Why are you not at the horreum?

08:00.335 --> 08:02.603
I was delayed by young Ulpianus.

08:02.671 --> 08:07.140
He has implored me to broach --
Now is place nor time.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.909
Come on, get on with it!

08:13.782 --> 08:17.117
<i>By permission of honored Aedile,</i>

08:17.185 --> 08:19.720
<i>I present yet another beloved slave</i>

08:19.787 --> 08:23.423
<i>fallen to treacherous thought</i>
<i>and whisper of rebellion.</i>

08:23.491 --> 08:26.860
And who would not fall to such
beneath heel of a toad?

08:26.927 --> 08:29.429
He was discovered
secreting scraps of food

08:29.496 --> 08:32.063
intended for journey
far from these walls.

08:32.131 --> 08:35.734
Laurus cannot be faulted
for a dog turned to madness.

08:35.802 --> 08:37.836
Show an animal kindness

08:37.904 --> 08:39.571
and it will give loyalty
until the heavens fall.

08:39.639 --> 08:41.573
<i>A journey that would lead to kinship</i>

08:41.640 --> 08:43.575
Show it nothing but the lash
<i>with like mind of untold</i>

08:43.643 --> 08:45.177
<i>mischief towards the Republic...</i>

08:45.245 --> 08:47.513
and wonder not why it bears teeth.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.049
<i>Shackles alone no longer</i>
<i>offer fair deterrent.</i>

08:51.117 --> 08:54.352
Let us add to them with
warning of weighted stone

08:54.420 --> 08:55.520
<i>and the promise of death</i>

08:55.588 --> 08:58.190
for any who dare follow in such regard.

08:59.459 --> 09:01.392
<i>Stop, and listen!</i>

09:03.362 --> 09:04.930
<i>Make him suffer!</i>

09:04.997 --> 09:06.565
<i>Finish that fucker!</i>

09:12.839 --> 09:15.507
Must make attempt to end this.

09:15.575 --> 09:17.542
It would but pair our fate with his.

09:17.610 --> 09:18.710
<i>I will not stand idle</i>

09:18.778 --> 09:20.579
while the man's life
holds in the balance--

09:20.647 --> 09:21.647
<i>Spartacus!</i>

09:23.182 --> 09:25.384
Spartacus!

09:25.452 --> 09:27.620
<i>Spartacus!</i>

09:27.687 --> 09:31.390
He will see your fucking
Republic to blood and shit!

09:31.458 --> 09:32.892
<i>Spartacus!</i>

09:32.960 --> 09:34.360
Spartacus!

09:34.428 --> 09:36.429
Spartacus!

09:36.496 --> 09:37.817
<i>Spartacus --</i>
See rebellious tongue

09:37.831 --> 09:38.931
forever stilled!

09:38.998 --> 09:40.165
<i>Spartacus!</i>

09:43.469 --> 09:45.370
Die!

09:45.438 --> 09:48.039
<i>With Spartacus that you will</i>
<i>all gonna have to lie!</i>

09:48.106 --> 09:49.106
Come on!

09:49.174 --> 09:50.107
Throw!

09:50.175 --> 09:51.275
Throw!

09:51.343 --> 09:53.878
<i>This is your time for retribution!</i>

09:53.945 --> 09:54.945
Die!

09:55.013 --> 09:56.413
Throw more!

09:59.217 --> 10:00.417
Yeah!
Die!

10:00.485 --> 10:01.685
Yeah!

10:08.493 --> 10:11.829
<i>Come on, throw!</i>

10:30.449 --> 10:32.050
You draw attention.

10:35.721 --> 10:37.989
I but end suffering.

10:38.056 --> 10:41.826
As I would for all so afflicted
by festering disease of Rome.

10:50.101 --> 10:52.302
Procure a cornicen for each centuria.

10:52.370 --> 10:54.872
I would not have command
obscured during battle.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.774
And see tesserarius tripled in number.

10:56.842 --> 10:58.809
Watch must be alert
should Spartacus attack

10:58.877 --> 11:00.511
under cover of darkness.

11:00.579 --> 11:03.180
I will not be caught unawares
as Cossinius and Furius.

11:03.248 --> 11:05.249
Another message from Senator Metellus.

11:05.316 --> 11:07.885
The man threatens to bury
us beneath a storm of parchment.

11:07.952 --> 11:10.154
The Senate grows anxious
for our troops to move

11:10.221 --> 11:13.224
from Field of Mars
in pursuit of Spartacus.

11:13.292 --> 11:15.259
They are not alone in such thought.

11:15.327 --> 11:17.795
Mmm, there are yet needs to be attended.

11:17.862 --> 11:20.564
How stand we on account of arma?

11:20.632 --> 11:24.501
<i>Sabinus and I have procured</i>
<i>what was requested.</i>

11:24.569 --> 11:26.904
You will be well pleased.

11:26.972 --> 11:29.406
Let us weigh the worth of your labor,

11:29.474 --> 11:33.975
set achievement to scale.

11:34.043 --> 11:36.104
You have exceeded expectation.

11:36.171 --> 11:39.439
He will recognize value
of all your efforts.

11:39.507 --> 11:42.142
And who most deserves
highest command beneath him.

11:52.550 --> 11:54.116
<i>Vulcan himself could not have forged</i>

11:54.184 --> 11:56.685
more glorious arma towards noble cause.

11:56.752 --> 11:57.752
It's a rare thing...

11:57.820 --> 11:58.786
for such blasphemy

11:58.854 --> 12:01.522
to be proven in execution of skill.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.024
I stand humbled
by the praise of Crassus.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.259
<i>A straighten back, and see words follow</i>

12:07.327 --> 12:09.595
<i>towards honest price.</i>

12:09.662 --> 12:11.096
Ninety denarii.

12:11.163 --> 12:15.199
My-my finest
offering.

12:15.267 --> 12:18.035
And cost of less divine spectacle?

12:18.103 --> 12:19.263
One hundred and twenty denarii

12:19.304 --> 12:21.705
per soldier, fully equipped.

12:21.773 --> 12:27.207
<i>As agreed upon by your noble son.</i>

12:27.275 --> 12:31.875
A fair price.

12:31.942 --> 12:33.776
Apologies, Dominus.

12:33.843 --> 12:35.307
He has arrived.

12:39.011 --> 12:40.812
<i>Your terms are agreeable.</i>

12:40.879 --> 12:43.614
Tiberius will conclude our business.

12:43.682 --> 12:46.816
Yes, of course,
gratitude --

12:46.884 --> 12:48.451
Did I not tell you?

12:48.519 --> 12:51.821
<i>There now stands nothing</i>
<i>between you and deserved title.</i>

13:01.531 --> 13:06.301
Am I to be kept waiting
entire fucking day?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.537
If that is my husband's wish.

13:08.605 --> 13:09.704
Huh.

13:09.772 --> 13:13.708
Well, one he shall not see granted.

13:20.902 --> 13:24.869
Caesar!

13:26.538 --> 13:28.238
Your men forget themselves.

13:28.306 --> 13:33.742
You are the one that has lost mind.

13:33.810 --> 13:37.546
Leave us.

13:37.614 --> 13:41.149
Hmm.

13:41.217 --> 13:42.851
She never did care for me.

13:42.918 --> 13:44.485
Have you ever given her reason?

13:44.553 --> 13:49.590
My apologies for not worshipping
her as Juno upon cloud.

13:49.658 --> 13:53.560
I would fall to my own wife,
too long from my arms.

13:53.628 --> 13:57.997
Cornelia has been sent
word of your delay.

13:58.065 --> 14:01.632
Delay?

14:01.700 --> 14:03.140
Is that what you term setting upon me

14:03.200 --> 14:05.132
as I return through city gate,

14:05.200 --> 14:09.858
in advance of bath or fresh robe

14:09.926 --> 14:14.202
to erase hard it necessity.

14:14.269 --> 14:16.789
Your victories abroad are well known.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.014
As is your insolence

14:19.082 --> 14:21.239
in waging battle against the allies

14:21.307 --> 14:25.389
of Mithridates absent
proconsuls' permission.

14:25.457 --> 14:26.814
The province would have been lost

14:26.882 --> 14:29.640
if I had waited on word
from those sodden fools.

14:29.708 --> 14:33.590
Ah, as I would've lost advantage
of lone voice upon ear,

14:33.657 --> 14:36.672
if I had waited to break word with you.

14:36.739 --> 14:38.067
Speak plainly.

14:38.135 --> 14:40.058
I grow tired of mystery.

14:40.126 --> 14:43.836
Ah, then let us part veil.

14:43.904 --> 14:47.023
You hold revered name
of the Julian clan.

14:47.091 --> 14:50.078
Sired from the bloodline of Venus.

14:50.146 --> 14:53.198
<i>Divine mother of Aeneas,</i>
<i>forbearer of Romulus,</i>

14:53.266 --> 14:54.889
<i>exalted founder</i>
<i>of Rome --</i>

14:54.957 --> 14:57.944
I require no lesson
in my fucking heritage.

15:00.470 --> 15:02.161
<i>Then perhaps one in mine.</i>

15:02.229 --> 15:04.086
I am descendant from no god.

15:04.154 --> 15:06.574
Nor man of lofty note.

15:06.641 --> 15:08.337
I'm tolerated within the Senate

15:08.404 --> 15:10.462
solely for the wealth I have amassed

15:10.524 --> 15:12.548
through labor and dealings

15:12.616 --> 15:16.337
<i>those with "proper"</i>
<i>lineage deem beneath them.</i>

15:16.405 --> 15:21.283
And you believe this singular
cause why they hate you, hmm?

15:23.209 --> 15:25.594
<i>Your campaign against Mithridates</i>

15:25.662 --> 15:29.411
and um other adventures.

15:29.479 --> 15:32.633
Costly, were they not?

15:35.964 --> 15:39.980
I know you stand in considerable debt.

15:40.047 --> 15:43.067
A dangerous place
for a man to find himself,

15:43.135 --> 15:46.384
when he's made enemies
of the "sodden fools"

15:46.452 --> 15:47.747
<i>who would see him to ruin.</i>

15:47.815 --> 15:50.173
Ah, I shall see it repaid.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.359
By what means?

15:52.427 --> 15:56.744
You possess name absent wealth.

15:56.811 --> 16:01.194
And you possess wealth absent name.

16:01.257 --> 16:05.640
<i>Imagine what could be wrested</i>
<i>from highest perch,</i>

16:05.708 --> 16:10.453
were Crassus and Caesar
to align themselves.

16:13.809 --> 16:15.171
My name has remained constant

16:15.233 --> 16:19.683
since falling from my mother's womb.

16:19.751 --> 16:23.402
You have been heavy with
gold for equal years.

16:23.469 --> 16:25.098
Why now suggest the pairing?

16:25.161 --> 16:29.052
Opportunity to seize
laurels and the gratitude

16:29.115 --> 16:30.844
of the Republic presents itself.

16:30.912 --> 16:34.498
And with it, first stone upon the road

16:34.566 --> 16:39.411
to greater glories.

16:39.478 --> 16:42.003
What would you have me aid you in,

16:42.065 --> 16:43.961
to see such a day hastened?

16:44.029 --> 16:47.811
Bring end to slave rebellion.

16:47.879 --> 16:50.866
And death of Spartacus.

17:03.345 --> 17:04.406
Attius.

17:04.474 --> 17:06.432
I would have words, you fucking goat.

17:06.499 --> 17:08.223
Jupiter fuck me!

17:09.420 --> 17:11.644
Have you lost wit coming
here, you mad shit?

17:11.712 --> 17:13.435
You are branded an enemy of Rome.

17:13.502 --> 17:17.423
I was told you hold
no love for the Republic.

17:18.757 --> 17:20.055
Tell me you have not brought

17:20.123 --> 17:22.977
the Bringer of Fucking Piss
and Shit to my very door?

17:23.044 --> 17:24.935
<i>Your legend precedes you.</i>

17:25.002 --> 17:27.261
<i>I bring but opportunity.</i>

17:27.329 --> 17:28.853
One that you may profit greatly from,

17:28.921 --> 17:30.116
if you are of a mind.

17:30.184 --> 17:31.842
It would have to be very considerable,

17:31.910 --> 17:34.734
<i>to outweigh risk of association</i>
<i>dragging me to depths.</i>

17:34.797 --> 17:36.225
A river shall flow in its wake,

17:36.293 --> 17:41.639
if we find ourselves lighted
upon favorable shore.

17:41.707 --> 17:43.328
What would such a journey require?

17:43.396 --> 17:47.571
Your skill, towards
the fashioning of swords.

17:47.639 --> 17:49.062
Swords?

17:49.130 --> 17:51.154
Hmm.

17:53.181 --> 17:56.268
The fucking Aedile denies
me the crafting of weapons,

17:56.336 --> 17:58.723
blame laid on fear of your rebellion.

17:58.791 --> 18:01.651
All that is struck now are fucking

18:02.710 --> 18:04.574
tools and shackles,

18:04.642 --> 18:07.703
to keep the slaves of those
privileged fucks in hand.

18:07.771 --> 18:10.209
The Aedile will not be of concern.

18:14.515 --> 18:16.082
How many would you need?

18:16.150 --> 18:18.686
Two will see our needs met.

18:18.753 --> 18:21.054
You give coin enough for many
times what you ask.

18:21.122 --> 18:23.323
The balance towards your discretion.

18:23.391 --> 18:25.359
And what purpose will silent
tongue not speak of?

18:28.363 --> 18:29.897
Do we have agreement?

18:38.645 --> 18:43.419
Two swords, and an end to involvement.

18:43.486 --> 18:45.521
Return as sun falls.

18:45.588 --> 18:46.655
I would linger,

18:46.722 --> 18:50.125
and recall joyous times
with trusted friend.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.827
I hold concern for the Roman.

19:00.895 --> 19:05.564
<i>Let us hope the weight of coin</i>
<i>anchors him to purpose.</i>

19:05.631 --> 19:06.631
Rejoin Agron.

19:06.696 --> 19:08.690
Make preparations.

19:08.758 --> 19:11.425
When moon is at its highest,
we shall see gate raised.

19:11.493 --> 19:14.887
And fucking city fall to deserved fate.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.022
<i>Attius.</i>

19:20.090 --> 19:23.058
<i>My appetite swells.</i>

19:23.126 --> 19:24.893
Where would I find holdings of grain

19:24.960 --> 19:26.694
within Sinuessa's walls?

19:42.309 --> 19:45.244
The finest quality.

19:45.311 --> 19:47.812
From the fields of Sicilia.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.081
I have mind towards large acquisition.

19:50.149 --> 19:51.649
Ah, I'll seal that for you.

19:51.717 --> 19:53.118
Apologies.

19:53.185 --> 19:58.056
My husband concludes business...

19:58.124 --> 20:02.393
No pressing concern
until moon greets night.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.204
You stand well supplied.

20:05.328 --> 20:07.596
Shipment received this day from Sicilia,

20:07.664 --> 20:09.331
with another to arrive upon the kalends.

20:09.398 --> 20:10.465
Although most of that

20:10.533 --> 20:12.013
has already been purchased by Crassus.

20:13.135 --> 20:14.635
Marcus Crassus?

20:14.702 --> 20:16.770
He favors our stores above all others.

20:16.837 --> 20:19.172
And one of the few that
can yet afford cost,

20:19.239 --> 20:20.573
ever rising in light of events

20:20.641 --> 20:22.608
concerning the rebel Spartacus.

20:22.676 --> 20:24.443
Have heard of the distress
he has caused the Republic,

20:24.511 --> 20:25.978
in my travels.

20:26.046 --> 20:28.047
What brings you to Sinuessa en Valle?

20:28.115 --> 20:29.348
<i>Slaves.</i>

20:29.416 --> 20:33.918
I find myself with ever
expanding family of them,

20:33.986 --> 20:37.854
and would ensure they
are well provided for.

20:37.922 --> 20:41.225
You have thought toward
housing them in the city?

20:41.293 --> 20:42.793
It has crossed mind.

20:42.861 --> 20:45.296
If you wish to see them
any form of comfort,

20:45.363 --> 20:46.864
I would strike from such.

20:46.932 --> 20:48.099
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.</i>

20:48.167 --> 20:52.369
I witnessed a slave stoned
in the marketplace.

20:52.437 --> 20:53.771
A common occurrence?

20:53.839 --> 20:54.772
No.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.875
Yet I fear it will become so,

20:56.942 --> 21:00.044
if this matter of rebellion
is not soon concluded.

21:00.112 --> 21:01.747
Let us pray, then.

21:01.814 --> 21:06.185
For the proper end to it.

21:06.253 --> 21:09.355
<i>He at last frees himself.</i>

21:11.525 --> 21:13.726
You were at the stoning
this morning, were you not?

21:18.998 --> 21:21.533
I was present at unfortunate spectacle.

21:21.601 --> 21:24.002
And ended it prematurely.

21:29.742 --> 21:31.877
Gratitude.

21:31.944 --> 21:34.413
The crowd pressed towards frenzy.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.716
I would not see more blood
spilled absent cause.

21:37.784 --> 21:40.119
Nor I.

21:40.187 --> 21:44.426
Absent cause.

22:02.320 --> 22:06.957
Bring knife to bear upon beard.

22:07.025 --> 22:11.428
Hmm.

22:11.495 --> 22:14.864
Why do you pause in the face of command?

22:14.932 --> 22:17.700
She but obeys a higher one.

22:17.768 --> 22:20.236
The dominus orders
you to remain unshorn.

22:20.304 --> 22:21.904
Toward what purpose?

22:21.972 --> 22:24.340
His thoughts are his own in such regard.

22:24.407 --> 22:27.209
And what are yours?

22:27.277 --> 22:31.346
I do not understand.

22:31.414 --> 22:33.781
It is a simple question.

22:33.849 --> 22:36.150
What are your thoughts?

22:36.218 --> 22:37.485
Towards what subject?

22:37.553 --> 22:40.821
The one that stands before you.

22:40.889 --> 22:43.024
How do you gauge Caesar?

22:43.091 --> 22:44.058
I do not know him,

22:44.126 --> 22:46.595
and can form no opinion of worth.

22:46.662 --> 22:48.530
Demand any question,

22:48.597 --> 22:52.066
and he shall break answer to aid you.

22:52.134 --> 22:56.004
You are taken with wife?

22:56.072 --> 22:58.140
Your eyes stand as my wife's.

23:01.822 --> 23:05.325
Mmm.

23:05.393 --> 23:09.704
As does taste upon lips.

23:09.771 --> 23:12.474
I would be reminded
of her in shadow's touch.

23:15.786 --> 23:18.020
Eyes shut towards difference...

23:22.726 --> 23:27.764
and warmed by longing remembrance...

23:34.439 --> 23:37.141
Kore.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.843
Remove yourself.

23:38.911 --> 23:40.011
Yes, Dominus.

23:44.450 --> 23:47.252
You send gift of wine and warm embrace,

23:47.320 --> 23:48.386
only to snatch
away --

23:48.454 --> 23:54.192
She was not sent for your
fucking pleasure.

23:54.259 --> 23:56.361
Apologies.

23:56.429 --> 23:58.630
I did not know the girl held meaning.

24:02.868 --> 24:07.305
You've been away too long
from civilized company.

24:07.373 --> 24:09.874
See yourself to robe,

24:09.942 --> 24:13.044
and thoughts towards
more pressing matters.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.549
<i>You present yourself</i>
<i>with breasts and ass</i>

24:18.617 --> 24:19.750
<i>formed with morning dew.</i>

24:19.818 --> 24:22.453
<i>Is it wonder that a man strong of desire</i>

24:22.520 --> 24:26.857
would not be tempted
to taste such ripe offering?

24:26.925 --> 24:30.795
Take lesson and remove
yourself from fucking sight.

24:30.863 --> 24:31.863
Yes, Domina.

24:33.368 --> 24:35.269
We have not yet procured enough horses.

24:35.337 --> 24:38.639
<i>I will not have cavalry found</i>
<i>lacking in moment of need.</i>

24:38.707 --> 24:40.041
What has happened?

24:40.108 --> 24:41.542
Nothing of concern, apologies.

24:41.610 --> 24:46.947
Break words, and find comfort
in how they are received.

24:47.015 --> 24:49.650
I was attending Caesar as commanded...

24:49.718 --> 24:51.618
Caesar?

24:51.686 --> 24:53.520
<i>Gaius Julius Caesar?</i>

24:54.589 --> 24:56.557
He laid hands upon me.

24:56.624 --> 25:00.827
If your father had not appeared, I...

25:00.895 --> 25:02.061
Where is he?

25:05.967 --> 25:06.900
<i>The man we hunt...</i>

25:06.968 --> 25:08.402
<i>was a champion at the arena,</i>

25:08.469 --> 25:10.270
<i>to rival any in the Republic.</i>

25:10.338 --> 25:14.808
Yet only a gladiator,
regardless of skill.

25:14.876 --> 25:17.211
How has he bested our legions?

25:17.278 --> 25:18.379
Spartacus knows of war,

25:18.447 --> 25:22.250
and the waging of it from
his days in Thrace.

25:22.318 --> 25:23.618
If rumor is true,

25:23.686 --> 25:26.387
he fought among the auxiliary
beneath the fool Glaber

25:26.455 --> 25:29.490
before his fall of Vesuvius.

25:29.558 --> 25:31.159
Then he's familiar with our tactics.

25:31.227 --> 25:33.628
And has used such knowledge
to the regret of those

25:33.696 --> 25:34.962
that have pressed him.

25:35.030 --> 25:35.964
Hmmm.

25:36.031 --> 25:37.132
He believes he knows

25:37.199 --> 25:42.537
what a "proper" Roman soldier will do.

25:42.605 --> 25:44.906
A thing that could
be turned toward advantage.

25:44.974 --> 25:47.776
<i>Would that my own blood</i>
<i>stood now so sharp of mind.</i>

25:47.843 --> 25:50.144
<i>Ah, years and the taste of battle</i>

25:50.212 --> 25:51.779
<i>will hone your pup's teeth.</i>

25:51.847 --> 25:54.015
<i>Of that I have little doubt.</i>

25:54.083 --> 25:59.954
Yet to bring Spartacus to ground
I must have a wolf at my side.

26:00.022 --> 26:01.422
Hmm.

26:01.490 --> 26:05.293
And let us turn gleaming fang
towards moon of full purpose,

26:05.361 --> 26:08.196
and see blood and gore matted upon fur.

26:09.264 --> 26:10.865
Curfew!
<i>Inside please.</i>

26:10.933 --> 26:13.301
<i>Make your way indoors!</i>

26:13.369 --> 26:15.637
<i>Curfew!</i>
Move, move.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.638
Move along!

26:16.706 --> 26:17.639
<i>Off the streets!</i>

26:17.707 --> 26:18.640
<i>You move along!</i>

26:18.707 --> 26:23.445
<i>Clear these streets!</i>

26:30.086 --> 26:31.854
<i>Messalina!</i>

26:33.023 --> 26:36.592
She has a habit of running wild.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.227
Here.

26:38.295 --> 26:40.296
You stay close to your mother.

26:42.265 --> 26:44.299
Gratitude.

26:44.367 --> 26:45.934
You inside.

26:56.413 --> 26:57.579
<i>You there.</i>

27:03.919 --> 27:06.154
I laid eyes upon you
in the square this morning,

27:06.221 --> 27:09.691
did I not?
As I upon you.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.359
Word has reached ear you spoke my name

27:11.427 --> 27:14.829
upon entering gate, claiming business.

27:14.897 --> 27:16.998
I fear you have been misled.

27:17.066 --> 27:19.168
You have nothing I find of worth.

27:22.906 --> 27:24.707
Then why are you within these walls?

27:24.774 --> 27:25.874
Remove hand.

27:25.942 --> 27:27.676
What is your purpose here?

27:27.744 --> 27:30.679
Put question to honored
husband, and have reply.

27:30.747 --> 27:32.047
He trades with the Aedile?

27:32.115 --> 27:36.118
He does.

27:38.154 --> 27:41.256
The mistake is mine, then.

27:41.324 --> 27:44.493
See yourself from the streets
before nightfall,

27:44.560 --> 27:47.095
to avoid further misunderstanding.

27:52.134 --> 27:54.202
<i>Come along!</i>

27:54.270 --> 27:55.603
Apologies.

27:55.671 --> 27:58.573
I assure you, not all
in the city stand as him.

27:58.640 --> 28:01.542
What he spoke of, removing
myself from the streets...?

28:01.609 --> 28:03.710
Is it not troublesome?

28:03.778 --> 28:05.980
I made attempt to dissuade my husband,

28:06.047 --> 28:07.615
but he thought it best
to have streets cleared

28:07.682 --> 28:09.083
of all but city guard,

28:09.151 --> 28:13.221
<i>until the rebellion has been quelled.</i>

28:13.289 --> 28:15.323
You have a place
to call your own this night?

28:15.391 --> 28:18.060
Yes.

28:18.127 --> 28:20.996
I have my eye towards such.

28:35.211 --> 28:38.780
<i>Move inside!</i>

28:38.848 --> 28:40.409
<i>All streets are to be cleared!</i>

28:43.152 --> 28:44.720
<i>Curfew is in affect!</i>

28:44.787 --> 28:46.788
<i>A little more securer this time!</i>

28:59.469 --> 29:01.370
<i>The streets cleared by guards?</i>

29:01.438 --> 29:03.772
By command of the Aedile.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.940
Did you know of this?

29:05.008 --> 29:06.007
Fuck yourself.

29:06.075 --> 29:09.811
News greets me with shared ear.

29:09.879 --> 29:11.946
Trust these will service need.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.953
They will.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.888
Yet there is more
we must ask of you now.

29:23.290 --> 29:24.623
I thought as much.

29:24.691 --> 29:26.959
Two hundred denarii a piece,

29:27.027 --> 29:28.747
<i>and you may lay hidden</i>
<i>here until sun crests</i>

29:28.795 --> 29:31.263
and curfew is lifted.

29:31.331 --> 29:33.399
It is not sleep we seek.

29:33.466 --> 29:35.668
What deformity of mind
do you think I suffer from,

29:35.735 --> 29:38.170
that I would give further
aid to enemies of Rome?

29:38.238 --> 29:41.140
We find ourselves heavy with Roman coin.

29:41.208 --> 29:46.379
<i>What cost would sober intent?</i>

29:46.447 --> 29:50.250
Five thousand denarii would
see me far from this city,

29:50.318 --> 29:53.654
and shores of fucking Republic.

29:53.722 --> 29:54.855
A bargain well struck.

29:57.494 --> 29:59.561
Call me Roman no more, then!

29:59.629 --> 30:00.729
How many more swords do you need?

30:00.797 --> 30:04.232
<i>Those that join us are well armed.</i>

30:06.268 --> 30:08.369
Join you?

30:08.437 --> 30:11.440
You move to take the fucking city?!

30:11.507 --> 30:13.075
We move to liberate it.

30:13.142 --> 30:15.210
The gate stands only in our path.

30:15.278 --> 30:17.012
We would to slit throats in the night

30:17.079 --> 30:18.246
and see it raised.

30:18.314 --> 30:20.582
<i>Unexpected curfew presents difficulty</i>

30:20.650 --> 30:22.384
in reaching it unnoticed.

30:22.452 --> 30:25.454
City guard would raise
clamor well in advance --

30:34.398 --> 30:37.233
I cannot aid you in this.

30:37.301 --> 30:41.971
It would mean my life.

30:42.039 --> 30:46.910
You have forged weapons
for Spartacus himself.

30:46.978 --> 30:51.047
If we are discovered with
your craft clutched in hand,

30:51.115 --> 30:54.284
then they will send you
to the afterlife all the same.

30:57.990 --> 31:01.460
Fuck the gods.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.162
What would you have of me?

31:10.671 --> 31:12.138
Gently.

31:12.205 --> 31:15.808
I should not have content
fall to ruin by rough use.

31:15.876 --> 31:17.643
Go fetch the rest.

31:17.711 --> 31:19.211
See that they are careful.

31:25.285 --> 31:27.753
You would see me weighted
with unnecessary comforts.

31:28.821 --> 31:31.690
Have I grown that heavy?

31:31.757 --> 31:32.724
These are yours?

31:32.792 --> 31:34.493
I would not be found wanting,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.730
if campaign stretches
beyond expectation.

31:37.797 --> 31:40.466
You wish to join me,
in pursuit of Spartacus?

31:40.533 --> 31:42.535
I wish no such thing.

31:42.602 --> 31:44.437
Yet I will not be removed from your arms

31:44.505 --> 31:46.372
for months threatening years.

31:47.708 --> 31:50.143
Publius and I shall travel
with you and Tiberius.

31:50.211 --> 31:53.146
You know women are forbidden
within encampment.

31:53.214 --> 31:55.548
Yet they are not banned
from followers' camp,

31:55.616 --> 31:57.651
unless rules have shifted
absent knowledge.

31:59.020 --> 32:02.089
I would not have my family
bedded among slaves and whores.

32:02.157 --> 32:03.857
Is it not better solution

32:03.925 --> 32:07.494
than having them stricken from embrace?

32:10.064 --> 32:13.199
Desire much appreciated.

32:13.266 --> 32:16.236
Yet I could not stay mind
from thought of your safety,

32:16.303 --> 32:18.104
placed so near the enemy.

32:19.806 --> 32:22.308
I would have you remain here,

32:22.375 --> 32:26.678
far from the threat of death
war so often promises.

32:28.948 --> 32:32.685
Is that sole reason?

32:36.123 --> 32:38.090
Father.

32:38.158 --> 32:39.559
All has been attended.

32:39.626 --> 32:42.228
Your army stands ready
to march upon first light.

32:42.296 --> 32:44.030
News well received.

32:44.097 --> 32:47.099
I would have word.

32:47.167 --> 32:50.336
There yet lingers issue
of what title I shall hold.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.337
I am possessed of leanings
towards the matter.

32:52.405 --> 32:55.574
Morning sun shall
see them fall to place.

32:55.642 --> 32:58.310
Have these returned
from where they sprang.

32:58.377 --> 33:01.045
I would have house in order
before we take leave from it.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.721
I thought honored position all but mine.

33:08.788 --> 33:11.624
Now I fear he favors another.

33:11.692 --> 33:14.327
Then you stand as your mother,

33:14.395 --> 33:18.365
bound by blood and inconsiderate worth.

33:35.917 --> 33:38.718
<i>It is a thing of rare beauty.</i>

33:38.786 --> 33:40.386
Is it not?

33:40.454 --> 33:42.656
Yes, Dominus.

33:42.723 --> 33:46.425
You will carry it when
you face Spartacus?

33:46.493 --> 33:49.328
I shall carry my father's sword.

33:49.396 --> 33:53.065
<i>It is not as well bred</i>
<i>or considered as this...</i>

33:53.133 --> 33:54.733
<i>yet it holds deeper meaning.</i>

33:54.801 --> 33:56.469
Caesar will carry it then?

33:56.537 --> 34:00.907
As your word and will?

34:00.975 --> 34:04.411
I should not have placed
you within his reach.

34:04.478 --> 34:06.012
He is a man of base needs.

34:06.080 --> 34:10.949
Then why honor him with title,
that above your son?

34:11.018 --> 34:14.319
Apologies, I overstep.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.856
You speak your heart.

34:17.924 --> 34:19.958
I know your concern for the boy.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.726
He no longer stands as such.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.964
But in the eyes of his father.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.436
Would my wife could
voice such simple wisdom.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.705
I saw the gathering of trunks.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.206
She goes with you?

34:35.274 --> 34:37.475
It was her intent.

34:37.543 --> 34:43.181
Yet I would find
no comfort in her presence.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.552
As I would in yours...

34:48.855 --> 34:51.223
Is such a thing possible?

34:51.290 --> 34:54.259
I will be forced to place
you within followers' camp.

34:54.327 --> 34:57.328
But yes, it is possible.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.797
If you so desire it.

34:59.865 --> 35:03.133
Yes, Dominus.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.236
I do not pose question as master,

35:05.303 --> 35:07.538
but as a man.

35:07.605 --> 35:12.343
And would have answer as one.

35:12.411 --> 35:14.812
Yes.

35:14.880 --> 35:20.985
It is something I desire, Marcus.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.354
Fuck my ass...

36:05.431 --> 36:06.364
Quickly!

36:06.432 --> 36:08.567
We must gather more men and swords!

36:08.634 --> 36:12.805
Spartacus is here!

36:18.378 --> 36:19.846
The moon nears its peak.

36:19.913 --> 36:24.517
Yet fucking gate stands firmly rooted.

36:24.585 --> 36:27.453
They will see it raised.

36:27.521 --> 36:29.855
<i>Or fall in attempt.</i>

36:29.923 --> 36:31.290
Ready the others.

36:31.358 --> 36:34.793
When gate trembles,
death follows upon heel.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.508
<i>Spartacus is within our walls!</i>

36:50.576 --> 36:51.509
<i>Move, come with me.</i>

36:51.577 --> 36:53.044
See gate protected!

36:53.112 --> 36:54.812
<i>You, open the storeroom!</i>

36:56.015 --> 36:57.415
<i>Quickly!</i>

37:03.089 --> 37:05.624
Reward will surely find hands for this.

37:05.692 --> 37:09.728
Of that I have no fucking doubt.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.243
Attius!
<i>Raise the alarm --</i>

37:25.645 --> 37:26.712
<i>Call for more men!</i>

37:29.749 --> 37:32.251
Hide yourself, I will find
you when it is over!

38:08.790 --> 38:10.191
See gate opened!

38:10.258 --> 38:13.361
<i>Clear the way!</i>

38:32.315 --> 38:33.249
Move!

38:44.294 --> 38:46.362
Arm yourselves!

38:46.430 --> 38:48.231
Forward towards the front gate!

40:14.785 --> 40:16.419
Diotimus.

40:16.487 --> 40:18.087
Where is Laurus?

40:19.723 --> 40:21.591
I am here, slave.

40:27.733 --> 40:29.894
You would turn against your
dominus and join rebellion?

40:30.903 --> 40:32.103
Fucking animals...

40:53.794 --> 40:55.361
Diotimus.

40:58.532 --> 41:00.200
The villa is taken.

41:00.267 --> 41:01.735
See yourselves free.

41:03.103 --> 41:06.172
Move.

41:06.239 --> 41:08.107
My dominus...

41:08.175 --> 41:11.444
<i>He is dead?</i>

41:11.512 --> 41:15.315
Then I shall follow
him to the afterlife...

41:15.382 --> 41:18.251
and piss upon his shadow...

41:39.873 --> 41:40.806
Ulpianus!

41:40.874 --> 41:41.974
We flee to Melia Ridge,

41:42.041 --> 41:44.409
if they have not already sealed escape.

41:44.477 --> 41:45.558
Have you seen my husband...?

41:45.578 --> 41:47.479
I have not, we must go.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.481
I will follow once I find him.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.116
May the gods protect you.

41:53.553 --> 41:54.486
The Aedile.

41:54.554 --> 41:55.988
Have you seen the Aedile?

41:58.858 --> 41:59.892
You.

41:59.960 --> 42:01.727
You aid Spartacus?

42:01.795 --> 42:03.296
No.

42:03.364 --> 42:04.697
I stand the man himself.

42:31.390 --> 42:32.324
Caesar.

42:34.527 --> 42:36.695
I had thought to find Crassus himself,

42:36.763 --> 42:38.096
the tone so matching.

42:38.164 --> 42:43.134
I am proud reflection of my father.

42:43.202 --> 42:45.003
<i>Tiberius?</i>

42:47.339 --> 42:49.107
Jupiter's fucking cock,

42:49.174 --> 42:51.709
you were but a child
since I last laid eyes.

42:56.782 --> 42:58.650
Apologies.

42:58.717 --> 43:01.253
<i>I am for my own home before we march,</i>

43:01.321 --> 43:06.191
<i>I did not wish to stain</i>
<i>it with such business.</i>

43:06.259 --> 43:09.729
Years abroad led you
to strange pleasures,

43:09.796 --> 43:14.333
worthy of the beast you appear.

43:14.401 --> 43:18.304
And your father...
he's not spoken to you of this?

43:18.372 --> 43:22.108
He finds himself preoccupied
with more pressing concerns.

43:22.176 --> 43:24.978
Well, I'm certain
he will share confidence.

43:25.046 --> 43:29.850
When he deems you deserving.

43:29.917 --> 43:31.017
You think I am not?

43:33.688 --> 43:35.490
Sleep well, young master.

43:35.557 --> 43:38.560
And dream of future glories.

43:38.627 --> 43:40.528
Under my command.

44:38.054 --> 44:38.987
Sanus.

44:42.158 --> 44:44.293
<i>Please, let my wife live!</i>

44:44.361 --> 44:48.097
The city is taken.

44:49.299 --> 44:51.834
<i>See the Romans that yet live to chains.</i>

44:51.902 --> 44:53.736
<i>Chains?</i>

44:53.804 --> 44:55.371
You let them live?

44:55.439 --> 44:56.806
They pose no threat.

44:56.874 --> 44:58.574
<i>Nor fucking use.</i>

44:58.642 --> 45:02.878
Would they show mercy
if we were beneath heel?

45:07.551 --> 45:09.218
<i>Still, cunt!</i>

45:10.553 --> 45:11.887
Spartacus!

45:11.955 --> 45:13.890
<i>The Aedile bars himself in the horreum,</i>

45:13.957 --> 45:17.226
spilling pitch and threatens
to put light to bear.

45:17.294 --> 45:18.628
Come.

45:18.696 --> 45:22.865
I will not lend aid
to you and your animals.

45:22.933 --> 45:24.433
If grain is put to fire,

45:24.501 --> 45:30.105
even I will not have voice
to calm my "animals."

45:30.173 --> 45:31.407
<i>You will do this,</i>

45:31.475 --> 45:36.278
or see your people that
yet live fall from this world.

45:40.818 --> 45:43.086
Please.
<i>Stay still!</i>

46:06.411 --> 46:09.413
You will not have my city's heart!

46:09.481 --> 46:11.315
Kill them!

46:11.383 --> 46:13.684
Kill them!
<i>Fuck the Roman man!</i>

46:16.455 --> 46:19.457
Make attempt on gate
and I will for all to torch,

46:19.524 --> 46:20.892
you fucking cunts!

46:22.862 --> 46:24.429
I can take him...

46:24.497 --> 46:26.564
Agron!

46:26.632 --> 46:27.832
Lower spear.

46:31.471 --> 46:34.773
Laeta...

46:34.841 --> 46:35.974
<i>Kill them all!</i>

46:36.042 --> 46:37.175
Go to him.

46:37.243 --> 46:39.377
And pray your words hold meaning.

46:39.445 --> 46:41.179
<i>Don't listen to his words!</i>

46:41.247 --> 46:43.315
<i>He's the reason we suffered!</i>

46:47.954 --> 46:50.889
I thought you dead.

46:50.957 --> 46:53.591
You would place our fate
in her fucking hands.

46:53.659 --> 46:57.195
I place it in what I believe in.

46:57.262 --> 47:00.765
I yet live, among a clutch of others.

47:00.833 --> 47:01.833
How many?

47:01.900 --> 47:03.501
Too few.

47:03.569 --> 47:06.571
And we will be fewer still,
if you do not stop this.

47:06.639 --> 47:08.372
You would give them
all we have worked for?

47:08.440 --> 47:12.143
<i>I would see no more death this night.</i>

47:12.211 --> 47:16.480
Open gate, let us see sun
crest upon another day.

47:16.548 --> 47:18.549
I will not bow to fucking slaves!

47:18.617 --> 47:23.354
Turn thought from them,
and towards your people.

47:23.422 --> 47:25.323
If you do this,

47:25.390 --> 47:29.060
<i>you will condemn them</i>
<i>all to the afterlife.</i>

47:29.127 --> 47:30.294
Your wife among them...

47:39.071 --> 47:40.505
Oh, no!

48:00.293 --> 48:02.995
He would have opened the gate!

48:03.063 --> 48:04.430
I know he would of.

48:04.498 --> 48:06.799
He would have opened the gate for me.

48:06.866 --> 48:09.368
I could not place faith in it.

48:17.944 --> 48:22.314
We have had our fill of blood
and vengeance this night.

48:22.381 --> 48:27.719
No Roman that yet draws breath
shall suffer further harm.

48:27.786 --> 48:29.787
The city is ours!

48:31.557 --> 48:35.160
<i>The city is free!</i>

48:35.227 --> 48:37.295
<i>Once again the Romans fall!</i>

48:38.931 --> 48:40.765
<i>Victory!</i>

48:44.803 --> 48:50.175
<i>To see one loved robbed</i>
<i>of life is a heavy thing.</i>

48:50.242 --> 48:53.845
One done lightly by Romans
many times to me.

48:53.913 --> 48:55.746
It is no balm,

48:55.814 --> 48:59.150
but know that I carry
the full weight of your loss.

49:02.322 --> 49:03.589
Place her in chains.

49:10.230 --> 49:14.400
War often carries with
it great sacrifice.

49:14.468 --> 49:16.268
None more keenly felt

49:16.336 --> 49:19.205
than threat of those
one holds closest to heart

49:19.272 --> 49:20.773
struck from this world.

49:24.577 --> 49:27.012
I would not have
my son fall to such a fate

49:27.080 --> 49:31.116
<i>because he was not ready for command.</i>

49:31.184 --> 49:33.485
Nor would I deny him opportunity,

49:33.553 --> 49:36.654
to prove himself
a man in his father's eyes.

49:43.495 --> 49:46.830
You stand as my word and my will.

49:50.768 --> 49:52.402
You honor me, father.

49:52.470 --> 49:55.272
As I shall honor the name of Crassus.

49:55.340 --> 49:58.242
<i>Ride with Caesar</i>
<i>and men of your choosing.</i>

49:58.310 --> 50:01.812
Seek out Mummius and what
remains of Cossinius' legion.

50:01.880 --> 50:04.348
Find Spartacus and send
word of his movement,

50:04.416 --> 50:06.150
but do not tempt engagement

50:06.218 --> 50:08.753
until I have arrived with proper force.

50:16.428 --> 50:21.699
<i>You fill the air with lofty promise,</i>

50:21.766 --> 50:26.069
only to command I bow to a fucking boy?!

50:26.137 --> 50:28.071
He is my son!

50:28.139 --> 50:30.774
<i>And shall be treated</i>
<i>with mirrored respect!</i>

50:38.483 --> 50:42.019
I have spread coin towards your
election as Military Tribune.

50:42.086 --> 50:46.257
<i>Formal title Tiberius</i>
<i>is yet too young to hold.</i>

50:48.927 --> 50:51.795
Wear my token to pass
unmolested through encampment,

50:51.863 --> 50:56.267
until appearance is shorn
to Roman likeness.

50:56.334 --> 50:59.337
I would prefer fancy sword
and expected position.

50:59.404 --> 51:02.506
Stay upon path I have set,

51:02.574 --> 51:07.378
and see greater glories
bestowed at journey's end.

51:07.446 --> 51:08.512
Hmm?

51:13.418 --> 51:14.418
Sound horn!

51:20.091 --> 51:21.959
<i>We advance south on Spartacus</i>

51:22.027 --> 51:24.495
<i>and those who follow him in rebellion!</i>

51:24.563 --> 51:27.731
Let our shadow fall upon them...

51:27.799 --> 51:29.467
and every man, woman, and child

51:29.535 --> 51:33.137
so touched by it struck from this world

51:33.204 --> 51:36.574
by the might and glory of Rome!

51:42.681 --> 51:53.379
