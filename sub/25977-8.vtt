13:04.201 --> 13:05.619
Great work.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.397
Go put our bags away.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.495
What are you doing?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.247
I was in the bathroom.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.338
I promise...

14:40.380 --> 14:42.007
when all this is over...

14:42.048 --> 14:44.843
we'll get your mother
and sisters.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.178
We'll be a family again.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.264
Do you trust me?

18:23.353 --> 18:26.147
You can't stop it.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.957
Where's my dad?
Why isn't he back yet?

22:54.999 --> 22:57.043
Samir, relax.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.753
He'll be here soon.

23:00.630 --> 23:07.095
20 meters down the hall
on the left, okay?

23:30.243 --> 23:32.870
You sure this is it?

23:32.912 --> 23:37.250
Same as the hospital
I worked in Riyadh.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.633
We'll use this vent
to release the cesium.

23:48.678 --> 23:51.139
With this air volume
once detonated...

23:51.180 --> 23:55.768
it will reach the president and
quarantine ward in 30 seconds.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.617
You'll press this one.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.536
With the peace of God.

24:26.757 --> 24:31.012
The detonator phone is hardwired
into the hospital's system.

24:31.053 --> 24:33.764
I've programmed the number.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.350
All you have to do
is hit "send."

24:39.979 --> 24:41.522
Let's go.

24:46.694 --> 24:48.279
All good.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.083
Someone's coming.
Let's separate. Take the stairs.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.459
What's the problem?

28:30.501 --> 28:31.794
It's not working.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.212
Try yours.

28:34.964 --> 28:37.091
Nothing.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.718
They must've turned off
the cell towers in this area.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.929
We have to get further away.

33:36.098 --> 33:37.975
I have your son!
