WEBVTT

00:42.433 --> 00:45.306
- Sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.178
I thought you left.

00:48.222 --> 00:51.486
- Not until you want me to.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.800
- Okay, we got
Sameera's tofu bacon,

01:01.844 --> 01:05.500
Harper's regular bacon,
and Raffi's turkey bacon.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.458
- Hey, if I pick up Harper
and Sameera from karate,

01:07.502 --> 01:09.547
will you grab Raffi from D&D?

01:09.591 --> 01:11.593
- Yes, that just leaves
Saleem's piano at 4:00.

01:11.636 --> 01:14.161
- No more piano.
I told you!

01:14.204 --> 01:15.727
- Well, it would save money,

01:15.771 --> 01:18.121
but, um, shouldn't we be
teaching them to stick it out?

01:18.165 --> 01:20.732
I will grab the troops.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.691
- Okay.
Thanks, babe.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.128
Hello?
- Dr. Frome? It's Roz.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.347
- All right, Raffi,
grab your homework.

01:26.390 --> 01:28.131
- Roz, hey.
Hi.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.351
- Great news.
I have a baby for you.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.527
- What?
You--you have, like, a real--

01:32.570 --> 01:35.573
uh, uh, now?

01:35.617 --> 01:37.575
- You and Martin have 24 hours
to report

01:37.619 --> 01:39.664
to Brownsville, Texas to start
the custody paperwork.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.623
- That's--that's not
a lot of hours, Roz.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.320
Uh, I, um...

01:43.364 --> 01:45.540
- Breakfast now because
we're leaving in two minutes!

01:45.583 --> 01:46.671
- You know what?

01:46.715 --> 01:48.238
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.675
- So what do you think
about piano lessons?

01:50.719 --> 01:54.549
- Oh, you know, um,
I support whatever you decide.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.551
- Hey, come on.

01:56.594 --> 01:58.205
We decide this stuff together.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.903
- Right.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.861
- Righty.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.346
- Wait.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.176
- Hey!
- Let's go.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.267
- You've got a dump and run
in the bay.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.231
- Pupil response is sluggish.

02:24.274 --> 02:26.450
- Another OD?
- It's never-ending.

02:33.327 --> 02:35.242
- She's one of ours.

02:35.285 --> 02:36.243
Shayna Davis.

02:36.286 --> 02:37.461
- Shayna?

02:37.505 --> 02:39.202
Shayna,
you're at New Amsterdam.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.899
- Oh, it hurts. Oh, God.
- Okay, where does it hurt?

02:40.943 --> 02:42.814
- It hurts everywhere.
Please, just make it stop.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.425
- I'm gonna need you
to be more specific.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.167
- Ask Dr. Sharpe.
She knows.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.648
- We need more money, Helen.

02:50.692 --> 02:52.650
My clinical trial's coming up--
- You mean our trial.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.565
Yes, you know what I mean.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.350
But the startup costs are--
- I hear you.

02:56.393 --> 02:57.873
We're not selling
the proton beam laser.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.223
- Cutting edge and cheap
don't exactly mingle.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.659
$40 million can go a long way--

03:01.703 --> 03:03.574
- We're the only hospital
in the tristate area

03:03.618 --> 03:05.228
offering proton beam therapy.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.708
Where are all those patients
gonna get treatment?

03:06.751 --> 03:08.405
- All six of them?

03:08.449 --> 03:11.278
We are trying to change
cancer treatment for millions.

03:11.321 --> 03:12.757
- We're not there yet.
- We could be.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.237
With that kind of money,

03:14.281 --> 03:15.499
we can make
the proton beam laser obsolete

03:15.543 --> 03:16.848
in a couple of years.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.459
- That is the issue.
It's not obsolete now.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.853
- I really think
you should recon--

03:32.734 --> 03:34.649
- Shayna?

03:34.692 --> 03:36.346
Look at me.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.524
Heroin?

03:40.568 --> 03:42.439
- It's the only thing
that works.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.701
The pain is just--

03:43.745 --> 03:45.399
- What about the Percocet
I prescribed?

03:45.442 --> 03:47.227
- It--it barely made a dent.

03:47.270 --> 03:49.707
After my last round
of chemo, I--

03:49.751 --> 03:52.362
I could barely get through
the day unless I tripled up.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.279
- When did you run out?

03:56.323 --> 03:58.934
- Two weeks before
my next refill.

03:58.977 --> 04:01.458
I--I tried to find some
on the street, but...

04:01.502 --> 04:03.765
Heroin was cheaper.

04:05.419 --> 04:08.813
I guess this is--
this is my life now--

04:08.857 --> 04:11.816
getting high with a bunch
of junkies at the Dalton.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.905
- Pain management is a part
of cancer treatment.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.603
There is no shame in that.
Do you hear me?

04:15.646 --> 04:17.996
I can make you comfortable
while we treat your tumor.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.564
- Can I have something now?
It just--it hurts so much.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.305
- We have to wait for
your tox screen to come back

04:22.349 --> 04:24.655
to make sure that the heroin
wasn't laced with anything.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.396
- I'm not gonna make it.
I'm...

04:26.440 --> 04:28.355
- Yes, you will.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.358
I'm gonna make sure of it.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.884
- Has Tawan had any significant
changes in his diet recently?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.364
- No.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.887
- And he's current
on all his vaccinations?

04:38.930 --> 04:40.802
- Yeah.
Absolutely.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.934
- And he's had
no dramatic weight loss?

04:42.978 --> 04:45.023
- No, he's never had
any health issues until now.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.938
- It's like everything
changed overnight.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.592
- Yeah.
His grades dropped off,

04:48.636 --> 04:50.551
his teacher said he can't
concentrate on anything

04:50.594 --> 04:51.943
for very long.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.989
- And the shivers.

04:54.032 --> 04:56.600
- The shivers?
- Yeah, he, uh,

04:56.644 --> 04:58.776
he started having these
weird muscle twitches.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.952
- We're gonna figure out
what's wrong, okay?

05:00.996 --> 05:04.347
- Well, what could
be causing this?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.610
- Well, I think
we should order an MRI

05:06.654 --> 05:07.959
and get some blood tests--

05:08.003 --> 05:10.571
- You must have
a theory or guess.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.010
- Um, well, it sounds like

05:15.053 --> 05:19.101
it could be an early onset
of MS.

05:19.144 --> 05:21.408
- MS?

05:21.451 --> 05:23.888
- We'll know more once
the tests come back.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.111
- Your leg is late
for a very important date.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.852
You were supposed to be
in pre-op 30 minutes ago.

05:30.895 --> 05:32.070
- Okay, how do you know?

05:32.114 --> 05:33.420
- Uh, because you didn't answer

05:33.463 --> 05:34.682
any of your pre-op texts
or calls,

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
so then they harassed me.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.120
- Okay, well, I have
a cardio pulling up any second,

05:38.163 --> 05:39.774
so I'm gonna have
to reschedule my surgery.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.558
- Nope, I'm here.
I can hold down the fort.

05:41.602 --> 05:44.431
- No offense, but actually--
- No buts, just legs--

05:44.474 --> 05:46.998
that leg, up to surgery.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.873
- Gabriela Alvarez, 34,
28 weeks pregnant.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.832
150/85, 130, diaphoretic.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.356
Decreased respiration
bilaterally

05:56.399 --> 05:57.574
with increased effort.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.490
- Doctor, doctor,
please save my baby.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.016
- Okay, let's get her
to Trauma 1.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.367
Where's Reynolds?
- He's on his way.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.846
- Max?

06:08.890 --> 06:11.414
Max.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.676
Max.
- What?

06:12.720 --> 06:13.938
- Maybe you let us
handle this one.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.378
- What do we got?

06:18.421 --> 06:19.770
- Right heart strain.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.990
Signs of tissue damage
in the left lung.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.122
- Dr. Duke,
what does that indicate?

06:24.166 --> 06:25.863
- Pulmonary embolism?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.430
- Ms. Alvarez?
I'm Dr. Reynolds.

06:27.474 --> 06:28.910
You have a clot in your lung.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.520
That's why you're having
trouble breathing.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.522
- What about my baby?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.959
- Dr. Goodwin?
Dr. Reynolds?

06:35.003 --> 06:37.701
- Why isn't anyone
helping my baby?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.877
- Ms. Alvarez...
- Prep me some lidocaine.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.879
-  is priority.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.884
- The fetus died en route.
- Gabriela, turn towards me.

06:46.928 --> 06:48.495
- How?

06:48.538 --> 06:50.758
- The left ventricle
was hyper plastic,

06:50.801 --> 06:53.978
and there was stenosis
in the aortic valve.

06:54.022 --> 06:57.460
Fetus wasn't viable.

06:57.504 --> 07:00.028
- We're not losing
Gabriela too.

07:00.071 --> 07:01.595
- You're gonna feel
a slight pinch

07:01.638 --> 07:03.205
and then some burning.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.815
- I'll need a central line kit.

07:04.859 --> 07:06.513
And prep an infusion of TPA.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.471
- The lidocaine is in.

07:08.515 --> 07:09.907
- Starting central line.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.692
Pay attention, Duke.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.698
- About 250 CC there.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.177
- Central line is in.

07:19.221 --> 07:21.441
-  in 20.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.446
- TPA is in.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.099
- O2 sats at 88% and rising.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.623
- Is my baby okay?

07:32.887 --> 07:34.454
- Gabriela.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.847
- Mm?

07:36.891 --> 07:40.242
- What I'm about to say is...

07:40.285 --> 07:42.766
is gonna be impossible to hear.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.224
- I'm not--I'm not sure
I understand it.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.618
I do something wrong?
- No.

08:08.662 --> 08:12.448
No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.278
It's just that--
bad genetic luck.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.106
The baby's heart never
developed properly.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.630
and there is nothing
that anyone could've done

08:20.674 --> 08:22.371
to save her.

08:24.329 --> 08:27.550
Stillbirths happen--

08:27.594 --> 08:30.292
more than anyone
ever wants to acknowledge.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.123
- What do you mean stillbirth?
She wasn't...

08:37.691 --> 08:39.519
- Gabi,

08:39.562 --> 08:43.131
we have to induce labor

08:43.174 --> 08:45.220
to get the baby out.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.008
- No.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.054
No!

08:53.097 --> 08:54.664
You mean I have to go
through all of that

08:54.708 --> 08:56.361
with no baby at the end?

08:56.405 --> 08:57.580
- It's the safest way.

09:00.670 --> 09:03.978
- I'm sorry.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.370
Is there anyone
that you'd like me to call?

09:05.414 --> 09:07.459
Family, friend, partner?

09:07.503 --> 09:10.027
- No.
There's no one else.

09:10.071 --> 09:13.378
It was just gonna
be the two of us.

09:13.422 --> 09:17.295
Just me and S...

09:17.339 --> 09:19.515
- It's okay.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.170
It's okay to say her name

09:22.213 --> 09:24.259
if you want to.

09:27.436 --> 09:29.743
- Sofie.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.623
Will you stay with me?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.112
- Are you following me?

09:51.155 --> 09:52.809
- Well, maybe.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.506
- Don't you have
lives to save

09:54.550 --> 09:56.160
or some surgery to perform?

09:56.204 --> 09:58.075
- I'm escorting you to yours.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.034
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.557
Thought maybe
you could use a friend.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.603
- Mm, thank you.

10:03.646 --> 10:06.214
But actually, I have my mother.

10:06.257 --> 10:07.563
- Jeanie knows about
your surgery?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.260
- Mm-hmm.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.610
- She doesn't even know
when your birthday is.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.308
- Well, she knows the month.
That's progress.

10:13.351 --> 10:16.833
It's one of my 12 steps
to make amends with her.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.356
I don't know.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.620
She cared enough
to show up, so...

10:24.624 --> 10:28.236
Hi, uh, have you seen a woman
who looks like me,

10:28.279 --> 10:30.586
only immediately makes
you feel bad about yourself?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.762
-  No.
You expecting someone?

10:34.808 --> 10:37.158
- Lauren...
- I am a big girl, okay?

10:37.201 --> 10:39.639
I don't need balloons
or a stuffed elephant

10:39.682 --> 10:41.815
or my mommy to send me off
to surgery.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.338
- You sure?
'Cause I can just...

10:43.381 --> 10:46.689
- I am fine, okay?
Go do your job.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.343
Go!
Go and do your job.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.432
- Okay.
- I'm fine.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.180
- Social services to the ICU.

11:01.269 --> 11:04.272
- Dr. Kapoor, I just got
Tawan's test results back.

11:04.315 --> 11:05.665
- And?

11:05.708 --> 11:09.277
- Nothing in the labs
or MRI points to MS.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.235
- I'm not surprised.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.326
I wrote down my diagnosis.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.763
- Schilder's disease?

11:16.806 --> 11:18.721
- You asked
the right questions,

11:18.765 --> 11:21.637
but you should have listened
more carefully to the answers.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.813
Tawan's behavior,
his withdrawing--

11:23.857 --> 11:25.859
- So he needs corticosteroids?

11:25.902 --> 11:27.643
- A rigorous course.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.428
In future, it's all right
to offer a hypothesis,

11:30.472 --> 11:32.430
but only if it's
an informed one.

11:37.609 --> 11:38.828
- Get them off me!

11:38.872 --> 11:40.308
Get them off!
They're on my face!

11:40.351 --> 11:41.788
- Tawan,
there's nothing on you!

11:41.831 --> 11:43.485
- He thinks there are spiders
crawling all over him.

11:43.528 --> 11:44.791
- Haloperidol.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.618
- Get them off!
Get them off!

11:46.662 --> 11:48.708
- Hold him still.
- They're on you too!

11:50.535 --> 11:51.711
Get them off!

11:51.754 --> 11:53.538
Get them...

11:53.582 --> 11:56.193
- Shh.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.330
- Hallucinations aren't
a symptom of Schilder's.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.506
Are they?
- No.

12:04.549 --> 12:07.814
-LOC is shifting.
BP dropping.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.337
- He's still.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.472
- Dr Sharpe,
did you discharge Shayna Davis?

12:14.516 --> 12:17.388
- No, why?
- I think she bolted.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.434
Should I call security?
- No.

12:19.477 --> 12:22.829
No, no.
I think I know where she is.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.837
- Hey, I got it.

13:27.937 --> 13:30.853
- Shayna.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.815
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.512
This is all I have--

13:37.555 --> 13:40.558
this or the pain,
and I cannot take the pain.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.256
I--I can't.
- Shayna...

13:42.299 --> 13:44.606
-  You're not gonna
talk me out of it.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.786
- Okay, all right.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.484
If you're gonna do this, then
at least do it somewhere safe.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.051
- Ugh.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.314
- Somewhere with clean needles
and clean works.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.055
- Oh, yeah?
And what place is that?

14:02.102 --> 14:04.452
- I'm gonna take you there.

14:05.888 --> 14:08.630
- Okay, Gabi.
This is it.

14:08.673 --> 14:09.936
Big push.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.025
- Oxytocin interval.
15 minutes.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.897
Okay.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.986
- That's it.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.293
- 2 Mu per minute dose.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.469
- You're doing great.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.735
You're doing great.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.490
- Okay.
Great job, Gabi.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.840
- You did it.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.929
You did it, Gabi.
It's over.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.976
- Pulse 92.
BP 130/90.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.419
It's so quiet.

14:58.462 --> 15:01.596
-  I know.
I know.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.864
Gabi?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.997
Do you wanna hold her?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.737
I can't.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.609
- I know.
I know.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.568
I know it's hard,

15:17.612 --> 15:20.441
but this is still
your daughter.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.008
This is Sofie,

15:22.051 --> 15:26.534
the baby you have loved
for months.

15:26.577 --> 15:30.625
And it's okay to hold her,

15:30.668 --> 15:32.714
even if it's just
to say good-bye.

15:34.890 --> 15:37.937
- I can't.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.766
- It's okay.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.464
It's okay.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.565
- Gabi?

16:00.220 --> 16:01.612
Sofie's here.

16:05.181 --> 16:08.010
- This is called a CuddleCot.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.317
It's a special bassinet that
keeps stillborn babies cool

16:10.360 --> 16:14.016
so they can stay with
their parents a little longer

16:14.060 --> 16:17.063
even after they're gone.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.456
- How can...

16:21.067 --> 16:23.547
It's so...
- Morbid?

16:25.245 --> 16:26.942
These devices
can give you something

16:26.986 --> 16:29.553
that nothing else can--

16:29.597 --> 16:32.382
time.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.385
- That thing can't
give me time with Sofie.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.344
- Not the time
you wish you had.

16:37.387 --> 16:39.041
Nothing can give you that,

16:39.085 --> 16:42.914
but it can give you
time to grieve.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.917
You know, some parents
keep a lock of hair

16:45.961 --> 16:48.572
or make a footprint
or take pictures--

16:48.616 --> 16:50.661
all the things
that you may have wanted to do,

16:50.705 --> 16:52.489
and just because she's passed,

16:52.533 --> 16:55.449
doesn't mean that
you can't have those memories,

16:55.492 --> 16:58.017
those moments.

17:11.726 --> 17:15.469
I think when you lose
someone that you love,

17:15.512 --> 17:19.951
most of us would choose
a few memories,

17:19.995 --> 17:22.476
painful as they may be...

17:24.521 --> 17:26.741
Over no memory at all.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.746
Do you want to talk
to a grieve counselor?

17:31.789 --> 17:33.269
- No.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.969
- Do you want me
to take her away?

17:38.013 --> 17:40.407
- No.

17:44.802 --> 17:48.458
I just want more time.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.460
- Yeah.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.119
- Dr. Romer, 78...

17:57.163 --> 17:59.208
- Tawan's not responding
to anything.

17:59.252 --> 18:02.124
His crit's low,
oxygenation's poor--

18:02.168 --> 18:03.691
I don't know what to say
to his parents.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.475
- I'm sorry, Agnes.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.783
This case was not the piece
of cake I was hoping it to be.

18:08.826 --> 18:10.741
- I think we should go over
his medical history with them

18:10.785 --> 18:12.134
one more time.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.266
Maybe we're missing something.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.485
- No.
Time for talking is over.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.400
We need to perform
the brain biopsy.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.447
That's the only way to get
his definitive diagnosis.

18:20.490 --> 18:22.405
- Don't you think
drilling a hole into his head

18:22.449 --> 18:23.667
is a little drastic?

18:23.711 --> 18:25.626
- We are running
out of time, Agnes.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.280
Go and book an OR,

18:27.323 --> 18:29.325
and page me when you find
Dr. Chambers, okay?

18:33.155 --> 18:34.417
- IM typical in appearance.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.594
- Fracture union normative.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.773
- No attributes...

18:42.817 --> 18:45.385
- Dr. Bloom's tibia realignment
looks good.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.343
- So she's doing okay?

18:47.387 --> 18:49.389
- I would say better than okay.

18:49.432 --> 18:52.174
Dr. Bloom should have
a relatively easy recovery.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.741
- Great.

18:53.784 --> 18:56.222
Oh, um,

18:56.265 --> 18:58.702
can you keep
my being here just between us?

18:58.746 --> 19:01.314
I don't want Dr. Bloom to know.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.185
- That you care?

19:03.229 --> 19:04.839
- No, no.
She knows that I care.

19:04.882 --> 19:08.408
She just doesn't like it
when I care.

19:09.626 --> 19:10.845
- Dr. Reynolds?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.586
Duke didn't show up
for rounds today.

19:12.629 --> 19:15.806
I can't find him anywhere.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.722
- I thought we were past this.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.857
- Outpatient pharmacy.
4401.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.338
Outpatient pharmacy.
4401.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.176
- Thank you.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.705
- Okay, nearly there.

19:44.748 --> 19:47.534
Um, I'm here to see Omar.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.101
She's with me.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.886
Thank you.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.149
- Yeah, just meet me
in half an hour.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.369
- You all right?
- Mm.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.719
Who is that?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.242
What is this?

20:00.286 --> 20:02.418
- This is a safe
consumption space.

20:02.462 --> 20:03.811
People come here to use

20:03.854 --> 20:05.552
without the threat
of assault or rape,

20:05.595 --> 20:07.380
and they're monitored
by health care professionals

20:07.423 --> 20:08.729
to minimize the risk
of overdose.

20:08.772 --> 20:11.253
- How is this legal?

20:11.297 --> 20:13.560
It's not.
- Helen Sharpe--

20:13.603 --> 20:15.257
as I live and breathe.

20:15.301 --> 20:18.739
- Omar,
thank you so much for this.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.219
- We have a cot over here
for you.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.439
- Okay.
Come.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.267
Have you had much trouble?

20:25.311 --> 20:26.834
- Oh, comes and goes,

20:26.877 --> 20:28.923
and we've gotten better
at evading the cops.

20:28.966 --> 20:30.751
This one's you.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.757
Can you, uh,
can you show me your works?

20:36.800 --> 20:38.454
- It okay.
You can trust him.

20:41.936 --> 20:43.807
- Thank you.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.250
And if you'll allow me?

21:04.698 --> 21:06.613
- Thank--thank you.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.572
- I need to test your product
for Fentanyl to be safe.

21:21.976 --> 21:24.892
I see you've not fully embraced
the value of what we do here.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.850
- I believe
your intentions are good.

21:26.894 --> 21:29.462
- Yeah, but not our methods.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.465
If people can start making
good decisions here,

21:32.508 --> 21:35.511
then we're helping.

21:35.555 --> 21:36.860
You're good to go.

21:47.784 --> 21:49.525
- I got a page.
What happened?

21:49.569 --> 21:51.614
- Room six.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:51.658 --> 21:52.963
- Don't take her away!

21:53.007 --> 21:54.487
- He's just moving her.
- What? Why?

21:54.530 --> 21:56.227
- We have another delivery
coming in,

21:56.271 --> 21:57.533
and we have to move
Ms. Alvarez to post-partum.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.013
- You said I could have
more time.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.971
- No, she gets to stay.
- But Dr. Goodwin--

22:01.015 --> 22:03.800
- No.
Out, now.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.367
- We still have to clean--

22:05.411 --> 22:08.501
- You will if she asks you to.
If not, you won't.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.764
She can use every resource
in this hospital

22:10.807 --> 22:12.722
or none of them
or anywhere in between.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.376
She is my patient,

22:14.420 --> 22:17.510
and she gets to stay
in this room with her daughter

22:17.553 --> 22:18.641
as long as she wants.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.643
Is that clear?
- Yeah.

22:22.297 --> 22:26.040
I--I mean it, Gabi.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.825
As long as you need--
days, weeks.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.740
This room is yours.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.969
- So what do I tell the OB's?

22:42.012 --> 22:44.667
- That Gabriela Alvarez
is not to be disturbed,

22:44.711 --> 22:46.452
and if anyone has
a problem with that,

22:46.495 --> 22:48.279
they can come talk to me,

22:48.323 --> 22:51.370
which'll be very easy
because I'll be right here.

23:09.344 --> 23:12.826
- Isn't she beautiful?

23:12.869 --> 23:15.350
Oh, she is.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.285
- Duke?

23:37.328 --> 23:38.808
Duke.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.506
What, you too good
to go on rounds now?

23:40.549 --> 23:42.116
- Rounds?
- Yeah, rounds.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.031
Where the hell have you been?

23:44.074 --> 23:46.773
- I was trying to--
I wanted to help,

23:46.816 --> 23:48.470
but I--I think--I think
I just made things worse.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.908
- Hey, hey, come here.
What are you talking about?

23:51.952 --> 23:53.388
What happened?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.521
- When we were in the ED,

23:55.564 --> 23:58.828
I didn't know Ms. Alvarez's
baby wasn't viable.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.527
And when I saw her so--
so scared and worried,

24:01.570 --> 24:03.398
- You didn't.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.837
- I told her we had the best
doctors in the country...

24:07.881 --> 24:09.317
and that her baby
would be fine.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.972
- Never promise a patient
everything will be fine

24:12.015 --> 24:13.495
because you never know
what might happen.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.236
- I know.
I know.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.498
I just--
- No more "I just," man.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.195
Come on, this is day one stuff.

24:18.239 --> 24:20.154
All right?
You never promise.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.503
- But you always say
patients need hope.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.026
Give them hope.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.506
Without it,
they don't get better.

24:24.550 --> 24:25.986
- That's right. They don't.
- So which is it?

24:26.029 --> 24:27.422
How am I supposed
to give someone hope

24:27.466 --> 24:28.597
without telling them
that we're going to help?

24:28.641 --> 24:30.991
- Just be there for them,
all right?

24:31.034 --> 24:32.209
When they're waking up
from surgery,

24:32.253 --> 24:33.428
when they're going under--

24:33.472 --> 24:34.821
you don't even
have to say anything.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.997
Just be there.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.870
- It makes all the difference.

25:27.917 --> 25:31.007
- How we feeling?

25:31.051 --> 25:33.227
- Oh.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.576
Better.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.668
Whew.

25:39.712 --> 25:41.975
But it never lasts.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.281
- Will you come back
to the hospital now?

25:51.550 --> 25:55.379
If you told me a year ago

25:55.423 --> 25:59.253
that I'd be jonesing for heroin

25:59.296 --> 26:03.039
to manage the pain
from a rare form of cancer,

26:03.083 --> 26:05.999
I'd have thought
you were crazy.

26:08.262 --> 26:12.353
I should--
I should've called you.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.268
I should've asked for help.

26:14.311 --> 26:17.271
- You still can.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.281
- Vijay.

26:27.324 --> 26:30.458
- So how is Ella?

26:32.591 --> 26:35.942
- Ella?
- Yes, Ella--

26:35.985 --> 26:38.031
works in Pain de Vie,

26:38.074 --> 26:40.033
is carrying
my potential grandchild.

26:40.076 --> 26:42.122
- I am aware of who Ella is,

26:42.165 --> 26:44.472
and you know that I can't
talk to you about this.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.561
- So she is a patient.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.302
- Do I look like I'm gonna
tell you anything?

26:48.345 --> 26:50.173
- I just don't understand.

26:50.217 --> 26:52.219
What I'm trying to tell
over here is...

26:52.262 --> 26:55.135
- Okay, I understand.

26:55.178 --> 26:56.615
I know, I know.
Vijay, I get it.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.442
You're feeling helpless.
You're feeling stressed.

26:58.486 --> 27:02.446
We're all stressed.
Hell, I'm stressed.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.665
- Stressed about Ella?

27:03.709 --> 27:06.102
- No, not about Ella.

27:08.191 --> 27:10.498
I did something stupid.

27:10.541 --> 27:13.588
I contacted an agency about
adopting another child,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.242
and now they have
a baby for me,

27:15.285 --> 27:18.114
and I really, really
want this baby.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.685
But I haven't told Martin
about it yet.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.252
- About any of it?

27:25.295 --> 27:28.124
- I know.
Ooh, this is bad.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.560
This is super bad.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.258
I, um...

27:31.301 --> 27:34.653
I swear.
I'm gonna tell him tonight.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.393
- Adoption.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.134
- Yes, about the adoption.

27:38.178 --> 27:39.570
- No, no, no.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.138
My patient--he was adopted.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.184
Oh, my God.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.540
- And now for
the burr hole incision.

27:52.583 --> 27:55.064
- Stop.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.718
Tawan was adopted.

27:56.762 --> 28:00.287
He has SSPE
from the measles virus.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.335
- Are you sure?

28:05.379 --> 28:07.773
- We have confirmed a high
level of measles antibodies

28:07.816 --> 28:10.253
in Tawan's bloodstream.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.779
The virus has imbedded
itself in his brain.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.606
- But we vaccinated him.

28:15.650 --> 28:18.261
- Tawan was three years old
when he came to the U.S.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.654
- He must've been exposed

28:19.698 --> 28:21.700
while living in the orphanage
in Thailand.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.397
- That was seven years ago.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.660
SSPE can lie dormant
for up to ten years,

28:25.704 --> 28:28.184
but once it becomes active,

28:28.228 --> 28:30.186
it progresses
through full stages.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.797
Tawan is in stage three.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.582
- Well--well,
what does that mean?

28:34.625 --> 28:38.238
- We will do everything we can
to help Tawan fight the virus.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.502
- But?

28:41.545 --> 28:45.201
- Every case of SSPE
I've seen has resulted in--

28:45.245 --> 28:46.725
in the child's death.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.607
- Hey.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.784
Mind if I join you?

29:02.828 --> 29:06.440
Dr. Proctor asked me to come by
and do a consult for Gabriela.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.442
- She wants to be left alone.

29:08.485 --> 29:10.487
- Yes, that is what
grieving people say they want,

29:10.531 --> 29:14.230
but it is not always
what they need.

29:14.274 --> 29:17.233
Sounds like Gabriela needs help
saying goodbye to her daughter.

29:17.277 --> 29:19.801
- She's not ready
to say goodbye.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.629
If she does,

29:21.672 --> 29:24.501
then her daughter
will be gone forever.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.810
- We still talking about
Gabriela here?

29:28.854 --> 29:31.117
- Don't do that.
- Hey, I'm not doing anything.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.814
I'm your guy, okay?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.381
Since the day you came back,

29:34.424 --> 29:35.774
I've been running
interference for you.

29:35.817 --> 29:38.428
Telling people
to give Max his space--

29:38.472 --> 29:40.822
you know, not to project
their needs onto you,

29:40.866 --> 29:42.432
that you'll open up
when you're ready.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.869
- I don't want to open up.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.567
- Yeah, I know.
I can see that.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.656
We can all see that,

29:48.699 --> 29:51.746
but that's the only way
that you get better.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.314
- Then I don't want
to get better.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.925
If I get better,
then I have to let her go.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.757
I don't want to.

30:26.737 --> 30:28.435
- Helen.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.306
Where have you been all day?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.526
- Meetings off-site.
Why?

30:32.569 --> 30:34.180
- We still haven't decided

30:34.223 --> 30:35.703
what we're doing to do
about the proton beam laser.

30:35.746 --> 30:36.965
- Yes, we did,

30:37.009 --> 30:38.706
and I'm not having
this conversation again.

30:38.749 --> 30:40.534
As long as we are co-chairs
of this department,

30:40.577 --> 30:42.362
we both have a say
on its direction.

30:43.667 --> 30:44.886
- Excuse me.
Are you Dr. Helen Sharpe?

30:44.930 --> 30:46.583
- Yes.

30:46.627 --> 30:48.716
- Please place your hands
behind your back.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.196
- Wait, what's this all about?

30:50.239 --> 30:51.719
- You have the right
to remain silent.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.547
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

30:53.590 --> 30:54.896
in a court of law.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.637
You have the right
to an attorney.

30:56.680 --> 30:59.683
If you cannot afford one,
one will be assigned to you.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.250
If you choose to answer
our questions,

31:01.294 --> 31:02.730
you have the right to stop
at any time.

31:02.773 --> 31:05.733
Do you understand these rights?

31:16.744 --> 31:20.052
- Thanks for the rescue.
- What was I going to do?

31:20.095 --> 31:23.011
Let you rot in jail
on some trumped-up charges?

31:23.055 --> 31:25.709
Don't worry.
We took care of everything.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.015
- We?

31:27.059 --> 31:28.887
- Well,
I hope you're well-rested

31:28.930 --> 31:30.845
because I certainly am not.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.412
- She got the charges dropped.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.718
- And I kept it
out of the press.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.199
Do you know how many favors
I had to call in tonight?

31:37.243 --> 31:39.898
They have photos of you
in a heroin den.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.508
- It's a safe
consumption space.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.336
And because of it,
my patient is in New Amsterdam

31:43.379 --> 31:45.033
instead of dead on the street.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.905
I am not gonna
apologize for that.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.384
- I don't care
if you apologize,

31:48.428 --> 31:50.517
but there will
be consequences for this.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.127
- What consequences?

31:52.171 --> 31:55.174
- The board will discuss
your fate in the morning.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.830
- I'm so sorry, Helen.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.964
I thought she was on our side.

32:08.361 --> 32:10.276
- Anything?
- Not yet.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.410
- I've seen so many children
die in developing countries

32:14.454 --> 32:17.109
from preventable diseases
because

32:17.152 --> 32:19.850
parents did not
have access to vaccines or--

32:19.894 --> 32:21.330
or know
they were important or--

32:21.374 --> 32:23.289
or couldn't afford them.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.073
But here?

32:25.117 --> 32:26.770
In this country,

32:26.814 --> 32:28.250
with all its wealth
and education

32:28.294 --> 32:30.339
and abundance of vaccines...

32:30.383 --> 32:31.950
- Dr. Kapoor?

32:37.303 --> 32:40.001
- There's a new treatment?
- Very new.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.221
- With a lot of anti-vaxxer
kids coming of age,

32:42.264 --> 32:45.006
SSPE is becoming more common.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.227
It's forcing doctors to try
new, untested treatments.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.403
- This one is seeing
a very limited success.

32:50.446 --> 32:54.798
It's a combination of antiviral
and immunomodulatory drugs.

32:54.842 --> 32:58.411
You need to understand.
SSPE has no cure.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.021
If this treatment works,

33:00.065 --> 33:02.110
Tawan will have to stay
on these medications

33:02.154 --> 33:03.590
for the rest of his life.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.462
I'm just happy it might work.

33:06.506 --> 33:08.116
It will work.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.944
- When can we start?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.815
- You will have to ask
your doctor.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.949
- She's the one
who discovered it.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.472
- We can start right away.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.088
- Any available IV nurse
to OR two.

33:23.131 --> 33:25.307
Any available IV nurse
to OR two.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.533
- Oh.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.884
Look who decided
to finally show up.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.147
Couldn't even be bothered
to bring me any balloons

33:39.191 --> 33:41.193
or a stuffed elephant,
could you?

33:41.236 --> 33:43.456
- Thought you didn't
want me hanging around?

33:43.499 --> 33:47.025
- Of course
I want you hanging around.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.983
You're like my best friend.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.420
- How much morphine you on?

33:51.464 --> 33:54.162
- But hey, this is what
I need you to do for me, okay?

33:54.206 --> 33:55.424
- Mm-hmm?

33:55.468 --> 33:57.426
- I need you to go down
to the gift shop

33:57.470 --> 33:59.428
and buy all the balloons

33:59.472 --> 34:02.605
so all the nurses think
that people care about me.

34:02.649 --> 34:05.043
- Come on.
People care about you.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.914
- No.
That is not true.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.177
People do not care about me.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.440
People tolerate me.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.052
People are glad
when I leave a room.

34:14.095 --> 34:15.531
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

34:15.575 --> 34:17.098
I guess it's just me.

34:17.142 --> 34:20.406
- Okay, just, uh--
first of all, stop that.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.364
And if I didn't care about you,

34:22.408 --> 34:25.237
why would I bring you this?

34:27.674 --> 34:30.198
- Peter Lugers?
- Bam!

34:30.242 --> 34:33.636
- My dad used to take me to
Peter Lugers when I was a kid.

34:33.680 --> 34:36.944
- When Jeanie
was being extra Jeanie.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.380
- You remembered.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.034
- Yeah.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.384
So now you've got
to get better.

34:42.428 --> 34:43.603
- Oh!

34:45.300 --> 34:47.955
Oh, my God.
Yes.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.524
- You're gonna save some
for me, right?

34:51.567 --> 34:53.482
- Sure.

34:53.526 --> 34:55.180
So good.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.536
- Do I have to go?
- No.

35:03.579 --> 35:06.147
I promised.
Remember?

35:06.191 --> 35:09.063
I'm just heading home
for the night,

35:09.107 --> 35:13.198
but everyone here knows
you're not to be disturbed.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.634
- Am I crazy?

35:16.766 --> 35:21.510
Keeping her close like this
even though she...

35:21.554 --> 35:24.252
Is it--is it healthy?

35:24.296 --> 35:26.167
Is it okay?

35:26.211 --> 35:28.038
- It's okay.

35:28.082 --> 35:30.084
It's more than okay.

35:32.217 --> 35:36.308
You can hold her if you want.

35:38.527 --> 35:41.313
- I want to,

35:41.356 --> 35:44.359
but my head keeps telling me

35:44.403 --> 35:46.187
that it'll make it worse,

35:46.231 --> 35:49.234
you know,
that that's not really her.

35:49.277 --> 35:52.585
She's gone.

35:52.628 --> 35:56.154
And then my heart tells me
that's my Sofie.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.331
That's my baby.

36:04.292 --> 36:07.556
What would you do?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.645
- Uh...

36:11.343 --> 36:12.692
All that matters here is you.

36:12.735 --> 36:16.174
- I feel like I'm sick.

36:16.217 --> 36:20.221
I feel like I'm not normal.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.180
Please, just help me.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.138
- Yeah, I, um...

36:27.576 --> 36:31.276
I--I lost someone...

36:31.319 --> 36:32.755
a few months ago, and it-

36:32.799 --> 36:37.107
it can't, uh, compare

36:37.151 --> 36:39.588
to what you're going through,
but, uh...

36:42.678 --> 36:47.074
I--I talk to her...

36:49.555 --> 36:51.034
All the time.

36:51.078 --> 36:55.300
I mean, full-on conversations.

36:55.343 --> 36:59.217
And I--I know that people
would say that's crazy,

36:59.260 --> 37:01.523
that it's not healthy, but I--

37:01.567 --> 37:04.222
what am I supposed to do?

37:07.877 --> 37:11.098
She--she, uh, died

37:11.141 --> 37:13.709
right after
our daughter was born.

37:13.753 --> 37:17.713
She would've loved
every second of it.

37:22.283 --> 37:26.200
But she doesn't--
she doesn't get to.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.508
She didn't get any of it.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.771
And I don't get her,

37:31.814 --> 37:34.164
and neither does--

37:34.208 --> 37:36.166
neither does Luna.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.212
So I--

37:38.256 --> 37:40.258
I tried keeping her alive.

37:40.301 --> 37:43.783
You know, to make her a part
of these memories.

37:43.826 --> 37:47.134
And I don't...

37:47.177 --> 37:50.616
I really don't care
if it's healthy.

37:50.659 --> 37:55.185
It's just what I have to do,
you know?

37:57.362 --> 37:58.667
To keep going.

38:05.631 --> 38:10.418
My worry for you, Gabi,
is that...

38:10.462 --> 38:14.292
you will never say goodbye
to Sofie...

38:16.468 --> 38:18.818
If you never say hello.

38:35.487 --> 38:36.923
Hey.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.794
- Guess who I talked to
a little while ago?

38:38.838 --> 38:40.622
- I--I don't know.
Who?

38:40.666 --> 38:41.884
The kids okay?

38:41.928 --> 38:44.191
- Our kids?
Yeah, our kids are fine.

38:44.234 --> 38:47.716
It seems that there's
an issue with another kid--

38:47.760 --> 38:51.198
a baby that,
according to Roz,

38:51.241 --> 38:53.505
we're adopting?

38:53.548 --> 38:55.289
- Babe, I can explain--

38:55.333 --> 38:57.683
- Yeah, you could if you were
coming home tonight.

38:57.726 --> 38:59.902
Iggy, I can't even
look at you right now.

38:59.946 --> 39:01.382
- Martin.
- No, don't.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.905
- Hey.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.484
- Yes?

39:22.577 --> 39:24.579
Ella.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.582
- I've been thinking
a lot about everything,

39:27.626 --> 39:30.759
and I think I finally--I--

39:30.803 --> 39:33.893
I think I figured out
what I really want.

39:33.936 --> 39:37.679
I'm...

39:37.723 --> 39:39.420
I'm keeping the baby.

39:47.863 --> 39:49.517
