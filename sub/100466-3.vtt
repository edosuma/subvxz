04:32.145 --> 04:35.063
The sun is shining,
the weather is hot...

04:35.065 --> 04:37.399
and we have got absolutely nothing.

04:37.401 --> 04:39.818
<i>Going on about three hours now.</i>

04:39.820 --> 04:45.031
- You sure about this?
- He's got a point, though, boss.

04:45.033 --> 04:49.077
If Zayef and Mahir have gone to ground,
then it's not much of a lead.

04:49.079 --> 04:53.289
The intel's patchy, but GCHQ have
intercepted an encrypted image

04:53.292 --> 04:57.002
from an associate of Mahir's
showing this pay phone with this date.

04:57.004 --> 05:00.422
Which could be a code
or deliberate misinformation.

05:00.424 --> 05:02.257
We're pinning it all
on a pretty slender thread.

05:02.259 --> 05:07.014
Well, when it's the only thread we have,
we pull it, see what unravels.

05:14.813 --> 05:17.480
Oh, I could get used
to a place like this.

05:17.482 --> 05:19.858
You're not thinking of leaving us again,
are you, mate?

05:19.860 --> 05:22.654
<i>Didn't work out so well
for you last time.</i>

05:23.905 --> 05:26.531
Stand by.
I have eyes on a possible alpha.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.785
Male, 40s, blue shirt.

05:36.293 --> 05:38.003
See him.

05:52.392 --> 05:55.896
- When are you arriving?
- Who's that? Is that Zayef?

05:57.314 --> 05:59.272
- Can you trace the call?
- I'm trying.

05:59.274 --> 06:02.525
- It's rerouting, bouncing around.
- <i>I'll be waiting at the meet.</i>

06:02.527 --> 06:05.195
Bravos, snatch Alpha.
Minimum of fuss.

06:05.197 --> 06:06.905
Our Israeli friends
don't know we're here,

06:06.907 --> 06:09.240
and Whitehall would prefer it
to stay that way.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.950
Copy that.
We'll grab him and walk him out.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.663
Copy that.

06:17.376 --> 06:19.084
We have an unknown hostile
on motorbike.

06:19.086 --> 06:21.296
Zero Alpha, we're in pursuit.

06:24.383 --> 06:27.050
Hey, sorry, bro. Back.

06:27.052 --> 06:29.596
<i>Bravo Two going mobile.</i>

06:32.683 --> 06:35.477
<i>Bravos, we need that target alive.</i>

06:49.074 --> 06:53.787
- Alpha One heading east.
- We are still covert. No guns, no noise.

07:01.128 --> 07:03.589
<i>Eyes on Tango. Right behind him.</i>

07:29.114 --> 07:31.074
<i>Shit, I've lost Alpha. I've lost Alpha.</i>

07:40.125 --> 07:43.003
<i>Zero, I have eyes on Alpha.
I'm in pursuit.</i>

07:49.593 --> 07:51.178
<i>Fuck me!</i>

08:01.063 --> 08:02.940
<i>Come on.</i>

08:05.192 --> 08:08.777
Alpha One is heading southeast.
I gotta head in pursuit on foot.

08:08.779 --> 08:12.658
- We still got a Tango on a motorbike.
- <i>Copy that, Bravo Two.</i>

08:36.682 --> 08:40.184
- You okay?
- Hold it!

08:47.109 --> 08:50.904
Go! Go! Drive, or you're dead! Go! Go!

08:57.077 --> 09:00.831
Drive, taximan! Don't stop! Go!

09:05.502 --> 09:07.877
- Get me the hell out of here now!
- Hold it!

09:07.879 --> 09:12.674
Come on, come on, come on! Move!
Move it! Move it, quickly, quickly!

09:12.676 --> 09:16.638
- Hands! Hands!
- Don't even think about it.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.853
You just fucked up my mission!

09:24.688 --> 09:28.233
And, you know... hello.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.287
- I'll drop you at the hospital.
- No hospital.

09:46.543 --> 09:50.047
Apartment. Shajara Heights.

10:03.769 --> 10:07.103
Get me a doctor.
Someone who won't ask questions.

10:07.105 --> 10:09.397
I have enough problems
in my life already.

10:09.399 --> 10:12.653
You're from across the border, huh?
Palestinian.

10:14.071 --> 10:18.408
- No, I just keep myself to myself.
- Wait, taximan. I can pay you.

10:19.701 --> 10:21.411
More than you're worth.

10:29.002 --> 10:30.837
I would need to see that money first.

10:52.651 --> 10:55.654
F-fucking thing. You get it wrong
three times and everything's wiped.

11:07.207 --> 11:09.416
What is it?

11:09.418 --> 11:13.461
I sell this, I give you 50,000,
if you help me.

11:13.463 --> 11:15.714
I'm bleeding pretty fucking badly,
friend.

11:15.716 --> 11:19.926
I need a doctor and fast. Please.

11:19.928 --> 11:25.559
This kind of money...
It could change your life.

11:31.815 --> 11:34.901
- Captain Zarkova.
- Alexander.

11:35.944 --> 11:38.528
Still hanging around
in the nicest of places.

11:38.530 --> 11:41.322
We would like to know a little more
about that man you were chasing.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.784
Yes, I bet you would, but I would like
to say hello to everybody first.

11:44.786 --> 11:50.373
- So... hello.
- Zarkova, good to see you.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.126
- Yeah, I wish I could say the same.
- Nobody's stopping you.

11:53.128 --> 11:56.632
Lance Corporal, you're still alive.
Good for you.

11:57.966 --> 11:59.549
- Thank you.
- Okay, great.

11:59.551 --> 12:01.217
Now that we have caught up,
exchanged pleasantries,

12:01.219 --> 12:04.512
I'm going to have to ask you
to stay the fuck away from my op.

12:04.514 --> 12:06.639
We had that guy before you got
in our way.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.392
You did not have shit,
and now I have a very big problem.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.479
Does your problem include
the two jihadists that are on their way?

12:12.481 --> 12:14.564
Aww, look at that.
We know more than you do.

12:14.566 --> 12:19.235
Really? Really? Do you even know
what he has, what you're chasing?

12:19.237 --> 12:22.572
No. Okay.
The man is Russian, wanted by Russia.

12:22.574 --> 12:26.495
This is none of your business,
so thank you.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.330
What is it that you want, exactly,
Colonel?

12:30.332 --> 12:32.290
We have intel. You have intel.

12:32.292 --> 12:35.418
We pool our resources,
for old times' sake.

12:35.420 --> 12:38.171
- We made a good team once.
- You ever worked with better?

12:38.173 --> 12:40.799
- Yes, many times.
- Ooh.

12:40.801 --> 12:44.427
Bit harsh. You working here alone?

12:44.429 --> 12:46.680
Again, none of your business,
but yes, I am,

12:46.682 --> 12:50.644
and I doubt whatever intel you have
will make me change that.

12:54.273 --> 12:58.527
We know where your target is.
Facial recognition just got a hit.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.197
His name is Lieutenant
Colonel Lev Kogan,

13:04.199 --> 13:07.409
Deputy Security Chief of the Combined
Arms Center for Electronic Warfare.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.161
He stole a device
from a secure facility.

13:10.163 --> 13:13.540
- Device code name, Imperiya.
- Imperiya's a myth.

13:13.542 --> 13:17.002
- Actually, it is very real.
- No fucking way.

13:17.004 --> 13:20.672
- And?
- Sorry. Imperiya is...

13:20.674 --> 13:24.426
Well, it's basically the cyber warfare
equivalent of an atomic bomb.

13:24.428 --> 13:26.344
A crypto-viral Trojan horse.

13:26.346 --> 13:28.304
It can take down a city's network
in seconds...

13:28.307 --> 13:30.640
power, security, emergency services...

13:30.642 --> 13:33.143
leaving the city utterly exposed
to an attack.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.022
You mentioned jihadists.

13:36.356 --> 13:40.859
We believe they've secured a deal
with Lieutenant Kogan for this device.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.736
Been tracking these guys for a while.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.030
We got a feeling they're ramping up
to something big.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.781
Any idea why they might have chosen
Tel Aviv?

13:46.783 --> 13:49.951
The weather, the sea,
jihadist cells on the West Bank.

13:49.953 --> 13:51.828
I have no idea.
I really don't give a shit.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.581
All I care about is Kogan
and what he's stolen from Russia.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.545
- How did you trace him here?
- That's not how we're doing this.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.681
Facial recognition picked him up
being helped

14:11.683 --> 14:13.852
into a short-stay apartment
in Shajara Heights.

14:15.270 --> 14:18.188
If we do this together, I take the lead,

14:18.190 --> 14:20.359
and Imperiya's mine
to take home to Russia.

14:26.490 --> 14:30.450
- We just want the people he's meeting.
- I will need a comms device.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.994
Comms are for 20.

14:32.996 --> 14:37.125
- Welcome back, Blondie.
- It's nice to see you too.

14:44.132 --> 14:46.841
- Here's how we're gonna play it.
- Bravo One keeps eyes on the outside.

14:46.843 --> 14:48.760
Myself, Bravos Two and Three
approach the building,

14:48.762 --> 14:50.430
and if we have to, we go loud.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.848
- You getting this, Zero?
- Copy that.

14:53.850 --> 14:57.854
Go with it for now, Bravo One,
but discretion is yours.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.027
- The doctor.
- No doctor.

15:06.613 --> 15:08.699
Not yet.

15:10.367 --> 15:14.119
So... how much is this worth, huh?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.454
He was going to give me 50,000
just for a doctor.

15:16.456 --> 15:20.836
It's worth nothing to you.
You have no idea what to do with it.

15:22.629 --> 15:26.717
Which is why you're going to tell us
what it is and who's buying it.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.723
<i>Apartment 3F was the last one
rented out, two days ago.</i>

15:34.725 --> 15:37.434
- <i>It fits the timescale.</i>
- So how was Russia?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.644
- I was expecting a postcard.
- It was good, you know?

15:39.646 --> 15:42.814
They were really grateful for
what we did, for stopping Pavel.

15:42.816 --> 15:46.234
- Oh, yeah? They throw you a parade?
- No.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.988
Just a medal.

15:58.373 --> 16:00.790
It doesn't have to be like this, huh?

16:00.792 --> 16:02.876
We have someone coming...
bandages, medical supplies.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.170
But we need to know the name
of the buyer first.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.756
Fuck you, taximan.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.134
I like this guy.

16:13.388 --> 16:17.976
I think you will start talking.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.567
Got local police out here. Nothing
I can't handle if it comes to it,

16:27.569 --> 16:30.320
<i>but remember, we don't have permission,
so the quieter, the better,</i>

16:30.322 --> 16:32.822
<i>regardless of what bloody Zarkova says.</i>

16:32.824 --> 16:37.077
Copy that. We'll do our best.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.121
You should be running your own team
by now.

16:40.123 --> 16:41.833
On the count of three.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.171
Three, two, one.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.634
Shit, we got possible contact.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.204
Tell me! The buyer!

17:27.212 --> 17:30.005
It's worth millions,
but you'll get shit.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.132
- We'll take him with us.
- He can't go anywhere in this condition.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.386
Take this.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.557
Go on, leave him. We gotta go.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.809
Give us cover. There'll be money in this
for all of us.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.272
Topal, move now! Follow me.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.152
Runners to the left!

17:54.406 --> 17:56.322
Wyatt, they may have the package!

17:56.325 --> 17:59.034
Copy that! I'll take them!
Bravo Two moving out.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.537
Stand back.

18:14.509 --> 18:16.011
-Move! Move!

18:26.396 --> 18:29.731
- Oh, God! I'm hit! I'm dying!
- It's just a scratch.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.486
- What's your name?
- Constable Yoni Spiegel.

18:34.529 --> 18:36.490
Hey!

18:39.284 --> 18:42.744
All right, listen, Constable Spiegel.
I'm gonna draw their fire.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.163
You're gonna get these people to safety,
okay?

18:45.165 --> 18:47.290
- No, no, no. I can't. I can't.
- These guys don't care who they hit.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.292
People are gonna get hurt.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.921
- Fucking <i>menyeck </i> scum!
- Give me the magazine!

18:52.923 --> 18:56.841
You've got the badge. You can do this.
Yes? Good lad.

18:56.843 --> 18:58.553
Okay, ready?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.057
Go!

19:10.899 --> 19:14.027
Go! Go! Move! Move!

19:32.921 --> 19:34.339
Fuck.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.342
Bravo Two, I got runners
heading down the east stairwell.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.930
<i>Copy that. Move in to engage.</i>

19:48.186 --> 19:51.062
Bravos, be warned.
Local police moving in.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.857
Pick up the package now.
We cannot be caught.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.736
Still engaging!

19:57.779 --> 20:00.449
Shit! Hold it!

20:02.284 --> 20:03.908
- What? What is it?
- Gas pipe!

20:03.911 --> 20:06.494
If we start shooting again,
the whole place is gonna go up.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.038
I don't think that's true.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.500
Anything that causes a spark
will ignite it.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.002
- There's not enough gas.
- Stop!

20:14.004 --> 20:16.379
Pull that fucking trigger, Zarkova,
and we're all dead.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.882
I think maybe you did not go
to university, so...

20:18.884 --> 20:21.634
- I've got a fucking engineering degree.
- From where?

20:21.637 --> 20:24.846
- The Australian Defense Force Academy.
- It's not exactly Moscow State, is it?

20:24.848 --> 20:27.476
I just need you to shut the fuck up,
Zarkova.

21:01.385 --> 21:05.303
So they sent the fucking <i>izmennik</i>
after me.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.516
Kogan...

21:12.688 --> 21:15.689
He was going for the gun.
I did not have a choice.

21:15.691 --> 21:17.985
They've taken Imperiya.
We need to stop them.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.657
- Bravo One, any sign of the runners?
- <i>Yeah, we've got them pinned.</i>

21:31.832 --> 21:34.543
Moving in!

21:41.091 --> 21:43.758
<i>Fall back.</i>

21:43.760 --> 21:46.678
Put the gun away
and keep your shit together.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.640
No, we can still get them.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.142
<i>Wyatt, we have no permissions here.
We can't be caught.</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:54.436
Zero Alpha, Bravos One and Two
withdrawing to extraction point.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.607
It's over, mate. Fall back.
They're gone.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.321
This is a misunderstanding.
We were just passing.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.366
- Oi, what are you doing?
- Cleaning up Russian fingerprints.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.828
- Boss said as quiet as possible.
- Not my boss.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.874
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.845
I think we need to talk.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.484
That was close.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.988
Open it.

22:55.165 --> 22:57.209
Let's see what this is.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.803
- What the hell is this shit?
- I think it's military.

23:10.806 --> 23:15.809
This is fucking wild, man.
How we gonna find a buyer for this?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.396
I don't know.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.358
I was thinking maybe Haim?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.901
No offense. You think Haim's
gonna talk to someone like you?

23:24.903 --> 23:27.195
If it's worth enough,
Haim will deal with anyone.

23:27.197 --> 23:31.783
Danny, this is a gift fallen
from the sky.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.621
This is a way out of all this.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.337
But I don't have your... connections.

23:45.132 --> 23:48.677
You're right.
You're not a scumbag like me.

23:52.347 --> 23:58.435
I'm in. I'll make some phone calls,
arrange a meeting.

23:58.437 --> 24:02.564
But, Topal, once Haim gets involved,
shit gets nasty.

24:02.566 --> 24:05.444
- You ready? Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

24:11.575 --> 24:15.076
Massive explosion on the streets
of Tel Aviv, four dead,

24:15.078 --> 24:16.995
and what the hell happened to Kogan?

24:16.997 --> 24:19.789
- He reached for a weapon.
- Convenient.

24:19.791 --> 24:23.084
- None of this is convenient.
- Lance Corporal?

24:23.086 --> 24:25.337
I didn't see him reach for the weapon,

24:25.339 --> 24:29.341
but I did hear him call you
the <i>izmennik,</i> which means a traitor.

24:29.343 --> 24:32.969
You didn't see shit, you were
getting your ass handed to you.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.347
Yeah, some people in Russia were not
happy I worked with the West because...

24:35.349 --> 24:38.058
Okay, who the hell initially opened fire
at the apartment?

24:38.060 --> 24:41.186
- Well, that was me, but I had to...
- You had orders to go in covertly.

24:41.188 --> 24:44.983
Orders? I did not have any orders.
This was my op.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.069
Do you think a silent takedown
would have been possible?

24:49.071 --> 24:53.948
- It's hard to say, boss, but, uh, yeah.
- Bullshit. We had no choice.

24:53.951 --> 24:55.825
I'd like to know why Russia's
sending in a lone agent

24:55.827 --> 24:57.869
rather than a squad,
not even a partner.

24:57.871 --> 25:01.081
Excuse me. Get your fucking secretary
under control, please.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.500
Well, you do seem to be struggling
for answers.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.797
Because I answer to Moscow, not you.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.217
This was a mistake.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.351
Bravo Two.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.272
Yeah, I got eyes on.

25:26.149 --> 25:27.818
Following.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.153
You were right, boss,
only way to be sure.

25:32.155 --> 25:33.697
Wind her up, and off she goes.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.993
And now we see where it leads.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.786
So... you're one of Odele's
little drug runners?

26:21.788 --> 26:25.290
Oh, no, no. That's my friend Danny.
Danny Dahan. We grew up together.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.293
Uh, he's the one who got
in touch with Odele.

26:28.295 --> 26:33.131
I, uh... I drive a taxi. Actually,
I co-own it with another driver.

26:33.133 --> 26:37.635
- Topal. Is it Topal, right?
- Yes, Mr. Haim.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.682
I've been told you have something
valuable that needs moved.

26:49.775 --> 26:52.400
- What am I looking at?
- Russian military tech.

26:52.402 --> 26:57.324
Secure lockbox. Without the correct
key code, it... it wipes the contents.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.831
Whatever this does,
people have died for it.

27:06.833 --> 27:08.543
It could be worth a lot
to the right buyer.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.132
Why come to me?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.387
Because I don't know
who the right buyer is.

27:20.639 --> 27:26.976
Uh, I have also the cell phone
of the previous owner.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.689
Maybe it will help.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.278
What is this?

27:40.242 --> 27:43.451
- Scam?
- No, no, no. I swear to...

27:43.453 --> 27:46.039
See, I, I came up from the streets.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.044
I know the shit you Arabs pull.

27:55.716 --> 27:59.009
So tell me the fucking truth.

27:59.011 --> 28:03.430
I hit the Russian with my taxi.
He wanted a doctor, but...

28:03.432 --> 28:05.183
But I stole it from him.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.858
Okay, you're a madman.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.404
So this Russian,
is he going to be a problem?

28:19.406 --> 28:21.865
- Uh, no, no, not anymore.
- Good.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.659
Then stop driving around
the fucking taxi that hit him.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.370
Leave this box with me.
I'll see what I can dig up.

28:27.372 --> 28:30.165
- I will need the pass code.
- No, not until we have a sale.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.792
I'm looking for a 50-50 split.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.170
- 70-30.
- Mr. Haim...

28:35.172 --> 28:38.256
Mr. Haim what?
Passengers ever give you shit?

28:38.258 --> 28:40.677
Tell you you don't belong here?

28:44.473 --> 28:50.395
People... know nothing.
Now, get the fuck out of here.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.280
- McAllister.
- Hey.

29:02.282 --> 29:05.241
Thanks for giving my superior
that witness statement.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.495
Didn't see any harm in giving you
the credit for saving those people.

29:08.497 --> 29:12.624
I've not had much success recently.
Some people around here, they...

29:12.626 --> 29:16.169
- They don't really respect me as a cop.
- I'm sure that's not true.

29:16.171 --> 29:20.968
Someone put superglue on my locker once.
I was stuck there for three hours.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.594
- Oh, you're serious.
- Yeah.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.723
I-I don't know how you do it,
bullets flying past.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.934
- You weren't even scared.
- The training kicks in.

29:30.936 --> 29:35.480
You press it down, get the job done.
Fight now, cry later.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.191
I will. Thank you, Thomas.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.276
Uh, if there's anything
I can ever do to help...

29:40.279 --> 29:42.195
Great. Actually, yeah.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.448
Uh, could do with IDs on the shooters,
and while we're at it,

29:45.450 --> 29:47.701
there's a couple of dodgy fellas
coming into town today or tomorrow.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.036
I wouldn't mind you seeing
if anything flags when they arrive.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.581
- When I said help, I meant...
- Spiegel, mate, come on.

29:53.584 --> 29:55.752
Don't need to tweak my statement, do I?

29:59.840 --> 30:04.759
So come on. How was it?
Seeing Zarkova again?

30:04.761 --> 30:08.263
Don't know, it was kind of like
a high school reunion, you know?

30:08.265 --> 30:13.395
Measure up where you're at in life.
Who got a medal, who didn't.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.189
How about you, sir?

30:18.191 --> 30:20.692
Well, she was a useful asset
to us before, so...

30:20.694 --> 30:24.740
- Yeah. That's one way of putting it.
- Meaning?

30:25.782 --> 30:29.286
Oh, nothing, sir. I just meant, like,
her assets were of use...

30:30.495 --> 30:33.373
To you... before.

30:36.585 --> 30:40.337
Sir, McAllister's fed through his intel
from the police station.

30:40.339 --> 30:44.090
He's got a confirmed ID on
one of the shooters, a Nadav Topal.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.760
Done some prison time for drug running,
now works as a taxi driver.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.846
- He's the guy that hit Kogan.
- It is. The plates match.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.266
A few hours ago, Topal went to
the house of one Yada Haim.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.268
Haim started out
with a shoeshine business,

30:55.270 --> 30:57.604
invested his profits
in back-alley gambling,

30:57.606 --> 31:00.899
graduated to extortion, loan sharking,

31:00.901 --> 31:03.109
now gone semi-legit
as a property developer.

31:03.111 --> 31:05.195
- And who's the cheeky babe?
- That's Rivkah Haim.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.738
They've been married for three years.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.616
Do we have any idea
why Topal was meeting him?

31:09.618 --> 31:14.371
Well, we shouldn't, but Haim's house
runs on a Wirepad Smart Home system.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.790
cameras, lights, heating, everything.

31:16.792 --> 31:19.417
You may remember Wirepad
were in the news last year

31:19.419 --> 31:21.586
for slack security in their software.

31:21.588 --> 31:24.383
Oh, yeah. I mean, the boss and I
couldn't stop talking about it.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.301
Well, some of us find
that sort of thing interesting,

31:28.303 --> 31:31.137
and it's useful, as it turns out.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.556
What, you can control
the cameras from here?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.768
- No, I can only monitor them.
- Right, well, um, good work.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.062
Try to find a way in.
Imperiya's the priority.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.066
Sir.

31:42.818 --> 31:47.153
Oh, come on. Sorry, it's running slow.
I'll take a look inside.

31:47.155 --> 31:50.534
- Bravo Two, sitrep.
- Yeah, I'm still on her.

32:08.427 --> 32:11.179
- Yeah, who's this?
- <i>You want a beer?</i>

32:18.437 --> 32:22.564
- So how did you make me?
- Your technique was fine.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.482
Wasn't looking for reassurance, kid.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.818
You need to stop following me,
Sergeant.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.323
- It was kind of a coincidence.
- What?

32:31.366 --> 32:35.329
- Us being here, you showing up.
- Or me being here and you showing up.

32:38.081 --> 32:41.291
- You look tired.
- Yeah, I'm fucking shattered.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.293
Last time I saw you,
you were planning to go home,

32:43.295 --> 32:45.255
make things right with your wife.

32:46.465 --> 32:50.925
Tried to go back.
I did, but you know what it's like.

32:50.928 --> 32:53.261
You get home and it's kind of
like home's changed.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.181
It's not really home that's changed,
though, is it?

32:56.183 --> 32:58.143
It's complicated.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.902
So what are we doing here?

33:08.320 --> 33:11.613
- Just catching up, I guess.
- No, you don't do catch-ups.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.573
You're working an angle,
making a connection,

33:13.575 --> 33:15.577
heart-to-heart, trying to gain my trust.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.581
And now you need to go, Sergeant.

33:20.874 --> 33:23.917
Whatever Zayef is planning, you know
it's gonna be some insidious shit.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.256
We're not discussing this.
You need to walk away.

33:31.718 --> 33:35.305
Sam... please.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.735
Thanks for the beer.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.587
Zero Alpha, I got some bad news.
I lost her.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.465
- Please tell me you're joking.
- <i>Why's that?</i>

34:12.467 --> 34:14.467
Because we just discovered
a back door into our system.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.428
<i>What? No, no, no, no, no.</i>

34:16.429 --> 34:17.971
It's been there since
she last worked with us.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.639
She wasn't here by coincidence.

34:19.641 --> 34:21.516
She's accessed every bit of intel
we've had.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.893
We just got boned, Wyatt.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.731
Shit.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.452
I know.

36:05.622 --> 36:09.332
Forget about Zarkova.
It was a calculated risk.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.546
We know what Zayef is after,
so we got what we needed from her.

36:15.132 --> 36:19.134
Now we grab this Imperiya device
before Mahir and Zayef.

36:19.136 --> 36:20.679
That's the mission.

36:22.180 --> 36:23.890
Nothing else matters.

36:35.986 --> 36:39.487
We're in. Haim's hosting an investment
party for his new property venture,

36:39.489 --> 36:43.199
Palm Branch Plaza,
you're on the guest list.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.577
The safe is in the basement
guarded by security,

36:45.579 --> 36:47.579
cameras, motion sensors.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.998
As it's a smart home,
everything runs on the same system,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.126
which means we just need to get
to the access in the vents there,

36:53.128 --> 36:56.379
and then I can take control
remotely of the house security.

36:56.381 --> 36:59.007
Motion sensors automatically
reset after five minutes,

36:59.009 --> 37:02.344
I'd like to volunteer McAllister
for vent-crawling duty.

37:02.346 --> 37:04.888
Uh, thank you, mate, but you're better
in tight spaces. That's your job.

37:04.890 --> 37:07.223
Novin will make her way
down to the safe

37:07.225 --> 37:10.228
and retrieve the package
using this little number here.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.273
Sick.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.108
McAllister, security will be heavy,

37:17.110 --> 37:18.902
so you'll be on man management.
Nonlethal, please.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.738
Uh, nonlethal, yeah. Copy that, boss.
I need to get this.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.866
By all means. You're only retrieving
stolen Russian military tech

37:24.868 --> 37:27.160
from a notorious Israeli gangster.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.412
Surveillance shots show
that the stolen device

37:29.414 --> 37:32.332
is in a STAVKET tech box,
key code operated,

37:32.334 --> 37:35.085
usually with a fail-safe
that wipes the contents,

37:35.087 --> 37:37.629
- but we have a bump key.
- I hate to be that guy,

37:37.631 --> 37:39.798
but if it's STAVKET-grade,
a bump key's not gonna work.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.759
But it can be tricked into reverting
to the factory default.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.845
000... anyone wanna guess the rest?

37:45.847 --> 37:48.848
- Hey, talk to me.
- My cousin at Home Front Command

37:48.850 --> 37:50.975
put those two suspects of yours
into their system.

37:50.978 --> 37:53.478
<i>They got flagged on the bus to Jordan,
crossing the border,</i>

37:53.480 --> 37:55.647
arriving Tel Aviv bus station
in an hour and a half.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.691
Oh, you're a superstar.
Send me the details.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.694
If these guys are dangerous,
shouldn't the police handle it?

38:00.696 --> 38:02.904
Look, by helping us,
you are handling it.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.906
Just got a lead on Zayef and Mahir.

38:04.908 --> 38:09.619
- Incoming, bus station, hour and a half.
- We divide forces. Secure Imperiya.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.080
- Excellent. Take Sergeant Wyatt.
- And if we get eyes on?

38:12.082 --> 38:15.208
- Capture or kill.
- Solid copy on that, boss.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.169
But that means we're two short
for the party.

38:18.171 --> 38:23.677
- Well... hmm?
- I'll do your hair.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.271
I don't feel entirely comfortable
in this.

38:35.981 --> 38:38.189
Or with how that man is looking at me.

38:38.191 --> 38:41.568
How you feel is irrelevant.
You look the part. Get to work.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.739
Nice speech, sir.

38:45.157 --> 38:49.242
Fuck me. How the other half live, eh?

38:49.244 --> 38:50.910
You'd be bored senseless.

38:50.913 --> 38:53.957
Yeah, but I'd start drinking at noon,
so...

39:07.471 --> 39:09.929
Hello, welcome. I'm Rivkah Haim.

39:09.932 --> 39:12.015
Alistair Fleming.
Fleming Mutual Investments.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.768
- And this is my wife...
- Tonia.

39:14.770 --> 39:17.687
- Tonia.
- So this is the new place, huh?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.773
The oasis in the city that you deserve.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.903
The pinnacle of luxury
and high-end living.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.071
That's quite a claim.

39:26.073 --> 39:29.699
Well, if you're going to bullshit,
might as well go big.

39:29.701 --> 39:32.412
Please enjoy yourselves,
and, uh, thank you for coming.

39:39.044 --> 39:41.086
Excuse me.

39:41.088 --> 39:45.048
- Nadav Topal.
- He make you?

39:45.050 --> 39:48.510
Not sure he'd recognize me, boss,
but I'd rather not run the risk.

39:48.512 --> 39:52.847
- Did you clock the wife's reaction?
- I did, yes.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.851
- Zero, sitrep.
- <i>Two minutes.</i>

40:02.442 --> 40:06.736
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Move into position.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.699
In and out, same route.

40:24.506 --> 40:28.466
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Business.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.137
With my husband?

40:32.097 --> 40:35.306
- Topal, is this about me?
- Of course not.

40:35.309 --> 40:38.935
Just so we are clear, I made my choice,
and I'm living with that.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.313
- Rivkah, last time we met, it was...
- Last time was a mistake.

40:42.316 --> 40:45.027
- If Haim ever knew you and I were...
- This is not about you.

40:46.361 --> 40:49.865
- Whatever this is, walk away.
- It's not worth it.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.999
- You okay?
- Yes.

41:01.543 --> 41:05.422
- Zero, sitrep.
- One moment.

41:11.887 --> 41:14.431
Don't even know why
I bothered to dress up.

41:18.936 --> 41:22.645
Bravo Three, you have your window.
Opening basement doors.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.397
Disconnecting motion sensors.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.361
<i>You have five minutes
till system auto-reboot.</i>

41:52.970 --> 41:56.765
- Bravo One, update.
- No ID yet, boss. Bus arriving now.

42:08.902 --> 42:12.072
Zero Alpha, positive ID.
We have eyes on hostiles.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.825
Looks like Zayef's
got himself a little fan club.

42:16.827 --> 42:19.663
<i>Observe and engage when ready.</i>

42:21.707 --> 42:23.834
Three minutes.

42:29.089 --> 42:32.590
- Oh?
- What do you mean, "Oh"?

42:32.593 --> 42:35.093
Well, the security system
seems to be trying to reboot.

42:35.095 --> 42:37.264
- I'm trying to stop it.
- Well, how long has she got?

42:38.390 --> 42:42.183
- Ten seconds.
- Bravo Three, get out of there now.

42:42.185 --> 42:45.353
Every alarm in the place
is about to go off.

42:45.355 --> 42:47.605
Three...

42:47.608 --> 42:49.816
Two...

42:49.818 --> 42:51.278
One.

42:54.656 --> 42:57.159
- What happened?
- Nothing.

42:58.660 --> 43:02.497
Nothing happened.
Alarm systems are down.

43:04.917 --> 43:10.378
- Everything okay, Alexander?
- Apparently, it is.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.091
Bravo Three, proceed.

43:14.134 --> 43:17.010
So you managed to neutralize
the backup security.

43:17.012 --> 43:19.179
Seemed like the smart thing to do, yes.

43:19.181 --> 43:21.431
I also may have a back door
into your systems.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.310
Thank you. We know about that.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.855
Are you working here alone?

43:28.315 --> 43:30.817
I am now, yes.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.152
And I think I need your help.

43:34.154 --> 43:38.782
<i>Bravo Three, security patrol. One Tango
inbound. Needs intercepting.</i>

43:38.784 --> 43:40.577
Follow me.

43:54.258 --> 43:56.843
Excuse me. Sorry, seem to have got lost.
I...

44:20.200 --> 44:21.910
Do you mind?

44:33.630 --> 44:37.426
- All Bravos, sitrep.
- Zero Alpha moving for exfil.

44:42.139 --> 44:46.433
Package secure. Moving for exfil.

44:46.435 --> 44:51.980
Zero Alpha,
got some unexpected company.

44:51.982 --> 44:54.899
- Yeah, it's your little cop buddy.
- Shit, what's he playing at?

44:54.901 --> 44:57.029
Get down!

45:03.619 --> 45:05.744
- Wyatt, cover me.
- No, mission comes first.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.912
- Look at him. Come on!
- You asshole.

45:07.915 --> 45:09.499
- On three. Three!
- Three!

45:15.881 --> 45:19.259
- Spiegel, come on!
- McAllister! Ah!

45:27.726 --> 45:29.519
- Come on, we gotta move!
- No!

45:34.441 --> 45:36.360
Keep your head down
and get your shit together!

45:38.987 --> 45:40.781
Move! Go! Go! Go!

45:45.369 --> 45:47.371
So, Mr. Haim...

45:48.872 --> 45:52.499
So the Russian's phone was a good idea.

45:52.501 --> 45:54.376
I need the pass code
so they can examine the product.

45:54.378 --> 45:58.004
I'll give it to them myself,
once we talk money.

45:58.006 --> 45:59.549
That's not how we're playing this.

46:05.097 --> 46:08.016
Topal, you will give me
the fucking pass code.

46:09.226 --> 46:11.520
The pass code, it is on my phone.

46:12.854 --> 46:14.731
Let me, huh?

46:24.574 --> 46:26.660
What are you playing at?

46:38.589 --> 46:42.718
Who's your lovely new friend, Alistair?

46:57.024 --> 46:58.942
Anyone else wanna be a fucking hero?

46:59.012 --> 47:04.012
