[hip-hop music playing]

00:14.597 --> 00:17.976
[Jeezy] And feel your body.
Feel your body.

00:18.059 --> 00:22.522
Move those hips,
move those hands, improvise.

00:22.605 --> 00:29.279
Move those hips and then we grind it,
bend it, grind it. Down and you pop.

00:29.362 --> 00:34.200
Arch those backs and swoop in.

00:34.284 --> 00:38.913
Six, seven, eight and finally bounce.

00:38.997 --> 00:42.167
That's it. And fan-kick.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.253
[woman 2] Hi, guys, how are you?
We're so excited to have you here.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.713
We're, like, over the moon.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.215
Um... for those of you I don't know,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.342
who I've just e-mailed
back and forth with, I'm Jo.

00:51.426 --> 00:52.844
-I'm Ly.
-And I'm Sam.

00:52.927 --> 00:58.433
And we have been wanting to do this show
for I wanna say years. A long, long time.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.685
We wanted to just feature one artist,

01:00.769 --> 01:02.854
but then we kept
looking through everything.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.439
We saw your work, too, and were like,

01:04.522 --> 01:05.857
"Nope, they gotta be there, too."

01:05.940 --> 01:06.941
[Ly] Right, right.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.904
I know you submitted stuff originally,
but as you move through the space,

01:10.987 --> 01:14.616
if you're feeling inspired, go with it.
Feel free to check in with us.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.119
We really just want
to reflect how you feel

01:18.203 --> 01:20.080
in this time as a woman,

01:20.163 --> 01:21.664
what power means to you.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.793
[Jeezy] Up, shake it and smack it.

01:24.876 --> 01:31.758
-Yes! I love the sound of booty flesh.
-[woman exclaims]

01:31.841 --> 01:34.928
We don't wanna get up like we just
picked something up off the floor.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.347
Like, "Oh, my God."

01:37.430 --> 01:40.350
Like, really take your time,
straighten your legs,

01:40.433 --> 01:43.937
arch that back, tune it up,
feel the back of your legs.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.855
Does that feel okay?

01:47.023 --> 01:48.775
All right, let's do it one more time.

01:53.613 --> 01:54.614
Hey.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.284
Hi, baby. How was class?

01:58.868 --> 02:01.329
Uh, cool. We learned a new dance.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.997
-Nice.
-Yeah.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.834
-How'd it go?
-Uh, good.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.418
I'm getting good at it.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.254
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.631
-How good?
-Real good.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.091
Can I come see it?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.926
-No.
-Why not?

02:15.009 --> 02:17.679
They don't allow spectators?
Parents don't come and watch?

02:18.263 --> 02:19.597
-Um...
-[both chuckle]

02:19.681 --> 02:23.601
No. Not unless you're dancing.
You can come dance.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.939
But I wanna see you, please?
Please, please?

02:28.022 --> 02:30.984
Maybe I can put on a show for you.

Me and Amber and the girls from class

03:33.713 --> 03:37.926
are gonna do, like,
an amateur night, you know?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.928
-Doesn't that sound hot?
-Yeah.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.932
I think people are gonna show up.
We're gonna do it for free, obviously.

03:44.515 --> 03:50.647
And I think some of us are
really considering becoming performers.

I thought this was like...

03:56.236 --> 03:58.446
I didn't even know you're
into performance.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.698
I thought this was a fitness class.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.117
Oh, no. That's what it started out as.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.787
But I mean,
you never know what's gonna happen.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.999
I mean, Jeezy's one of the most
inspiring people I have ever met.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.669
I wanna do for people
what she has done to me

04:12.752 --> 04:14.420
every time I've walked
into that classroom.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.506
You know?

04:17.590 --> 04:20.593
I don't know, man.
I did go in for, like, the workout but...

04:23.054 --> 04:27.976
I didn't go looking for burlesque.
What if burlesque was looking for me?

04:31.604 --> 04:35.066
[music playing over speakers]

04:50.623 --> 04:53.876
[woman]  What do you mean she's not down?
Did she say that she's not cool with it?

04:53.960 --> 04:58.131
No, she's not gonna say that.
But she's definitely...

04:59.215 --> 05:01.175
-How do you know that?
-Not excited.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.593
-What makes you say that?
-She wasn't excited.

05:02.677 --> 05:06.931
Jo is the most feminist, like, activist.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.560
"Yes, do what feels good.
Yes, love your body."

05:10.643 --> 05:13.646
We go to strip clubs together,
and she loves it.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.817
-Like, I can't imagine a world where--
-What if she doesn't--

05:17.900 --> 05:21.946
What if she thinks feminism is hot,
but not hot on me?

05:22.488 --> 05:26.659
-What? Maybe you just read into it wrong.
-Maybe.

05:26.743 --> 05:28.995
Maybe she was just so excited
that she got kind of quiet.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.331
-[both chuckle]
-She's just like...

05:31.414 --> 05:35.752
Hmm. For some reason, I doubt that.
Just frozen 'cause she's so excited.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.463
Okay, let's do it like a foot,
foot and a half out,

05:38.546 --> 05:41.674
and then we'll leave a little extra room
on this and we can cut it on the day.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.759
-[woman] Perfect.
-Sweet.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.762
I wanna be aware of color in here,

05:45.845 --> 05:48.056
because it's gonna be painted
for the entire thing, so...

05:48.139 --> 05:49.140
[Sam] Okay.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.392
[Jo] There's less color in here,
which I'm okay with.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.810
We have the neon sign.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.562
[Sam] You were talking about moving it
to the other room?

05:54.645 --> 05:55.646
Yeah.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.983
You're flexible. You got this.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.861
-[all laugh]
-Yeah. Nice. Cool.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.738
Sweet.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.490
[man] That was a great discussion.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.784
I think we can all say
we learned something, right?

06:07.867 --> 06:12.080
But, look, I'm not gonna be here
on Thursday for my regular office hours.

06:12.163 --> 06:16.125
So, if you haven't talked to me
about your final paper,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.253
you need to stop by my office
on Wednesday.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.717
[chuckles] Whoa.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.220
-You made it.
-Hey, dude. Mmm!

06:27.303 --> 06:29.347
Oh, I love it. All right, let's do this.

06:29.430 --> 06:32.725
-How long did those take?
-Not as long as I thought they would.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.311
-Check 'em out.
-They're so cute.

cute little ladies.

-Thank you. I'll see you soon, dude.
-Yes, definitely. Have a good one.

Hi. I'm gonna be in a burlesque show.

come be in it,

-Hi.
-Hi.

wanna talk about my show.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.532
Thinking about how you feel about it,

07:29.615 --> 07:34.662
'cause, you know,
you're kind of one of my, you know...

07:36.080 --> 07:38.249
-I look up to you.
-I'm one of your girlfriends?

07:38.332 --> 07:40.334
Since you're one of my girlfriends
I look up to,

07:40.418 --> 07:43.880
you know,
when it comes to the whole thing of the--

07:43.963 --> 07:45.756

or something?

07:45.840 --> 07:46.716
No.

-Okay. I mean, I--
-Are you?

07:50.344 --> 07:52.221
-About your show?
-Yeah.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.599
-No. Dude.
-Are you completely comfortable?

07:54.682 --> 07:57.393
-Yes, totally. 100%.
-Mm-hmm.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.022
I am behind you, and I love you,
and you're gonna be sexy

08:01.105 --> 08:04.025
and you're gonna rock it
and I'm so, so happy.

Great job in the class today.

Collect your gloves, collect your stuff.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.482
Everyone's amazing.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.943
I'll see you next week
for stocking removals.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.655
But if you're free this weekend,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.865
you should come to Jeezy's Juke Joint,

09:34.949 --> 09:38.619
a Black Burly-Q Revue, which is
an all black, queer-ass burlesque show

09:38.703 --> 09:42.039
down at the Promontory in Hyde Park
this Friday and Saturday,

09:42.123 --> 09:45.209
and we have amazing, award-winning
performers from all over the country.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.462
We got burlesque, striptease, music,

09:48.546 --> 09:52.883
male burlesque,
a pole dancer from Atlanta, okay?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.386
So, I'ma see you all there?
I'ma see you there?

09:55.469 --> 09:58.055
See your white ass there?
You're gonna be there?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.975
All right, give yourselves
a round of applause. Great job!

10:04.645 --> 10:06.606

[Chase] Should we just go over there?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.194
I'm waiting, I'm watching.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.364
-I'm waiting for her to be ready.
-No, she's chillin'. Okay, fuck it.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.783
-[Chase] Hey, Jeez.
-Hey.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.951
So...

10:19.035 --> 10:22.288
We were wondering if
you wanna come get a drink with us.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.123
Yeah, we were just gonna go down...

10:24.206 --> 10:27.001
-I don't know if that's weird to ask you.
-Um... Yes.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.503
Literally no one's ever asked me
to get a drink.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.840
-What?
-I know, but I need a tequila so bad.

10:32.923 --> 10:36.010
I need a tequila like
I need some new black friends. Okay?

10:36.093 --> 10:38.346
[shouting]

10:38.429 --> 10:40.306
-It's Friday, I can do whatever I want.
-Cheers!

10:40.389 --> 10:43.809
-Cheers to... keeping it in the family?
-Keeping it in the family.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.271
When people think burlesque,
they think pinup,

10:47.355 --> 10:51.734
-you know, a certain style, shape, size.
-[Amber] Not past a certain size.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.321
Right, exactly.
Certain skin tones, hairstyles.

10:55.404 --> 10:58.491
So, I was like,
"No, we need to have a black-ass show."

10:58.574 --> 11:02.536
-I wanna see, like, weave, dyed hair.
-Flying everywhere.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.581
-I just wanna see all types of bodies.
-[Amber] Weave everywhere.

11:05.665 --> 11:06.582
Yeah!

11:06.666 --> 11:08.417
So what about
other people that you've dated?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.419
-Is it, like, a good thing?
-Uh...

11:10.503 --> 11:12.463
Do they think it's super hot
that you strip or...

11:12.546 --> 11:14.256
Everybody wants to date a stripper
or burlesque dancer

11:14.340 --> 11:17.093
until they actually start dating
a stripper or burlesque dancer.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.097
And then they're like, "Oh, wait,
you're still gonna do it, though?"

11:21.180 --> 11:22.598
Bitch, yes.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.142
So they want you to stop
once you start dating them?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.602
Sometimes people will or they're like,

11:26.685 --> 11:29.480
"This is too much for me."
Or like...

11:29.563 --> 11:31.941

This is a feminist art show,

you not hand those out.

when they see the show.

Of course I don't have a problem,
but some people will,

15:05.070 --> 15:07.239
and I just don't want that happening
at my show.

on the floor.
