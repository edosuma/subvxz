23:17.664 --> 23:18.965
Now, how about that catch?

23:18.998 --> 23:20.066
That sounds awesome.

23:20.099 --> 23:21.200
Let's do it.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.636
Hey, have you ever heard
of a lake of fire?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.605
Lake of fire? No.
Why?

23:25.638 --> 23:28.274
Cattie says you and I are going
there in a hand basket.

23:28.307 --> 23:29.341
Huh.

23:30.843 --> 23:32.645
-[ Laughs ]
-I wasn't ready.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.246
Here you go.
Right here.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.048
* A good today

23:36.082 --> 23:38.050
* Gonna keep this smile

23:38.084 --> 23:39.919
Classic Fairbell.

23:39.952 --> 23:42.922
Well, go get the ladder,
you dumb mother[bleep]

23:42.955 --> 23:44.557
Aye, aye, sir!

23:44.591 --> 23:46.559
[ Chuckles ]
* Day today

23:46.593 --> 23:48.094
[ Sighs ]

23:48.127 --> 23:50.597
Now, students have claimed
that they saw you

23:50.630 --> 23:54.433
and Mr. Shoemaker in the library
up to something suspicious --

23:54.467 --> 23:57.770
something, oh, I don't know,
ritualistic, maybe?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.806
[ Laughs ]

24:03.342 --> 24:04.811
Principal Goodman,

24:04.844 --> 24:06.946
there is a reasonable
explanation for this.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.114
Shoemaker?

24:08.147 --> 24:09.816
[ Breathing heavily ]
She's the devil!

24:09.849 --> 24:12.118
-Abbey is the goddamn devil.
-Mm-hmm.

24:15.522 --> 24:17.456
Tammy, did you see
a black cat run in here?

24:17.490 --> 24:18.457
Hell no.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.594
Ugh, god!

24:21.628 --> 24:24.931
[ Meows ]

24:24.964 --> 24:26.533
[ Groans ]

24:26.566 --> 24:27.800
Oh, sh--

24:27.834 --> 24:30.102
Uh, you know what?

24:30.136 --> 24:32.839
Screw it.
I'm a witch.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.307
There!
Now, was that so hard?

24:35.341 --> 24:36.843
[ Scoffs ]
Well, there's that darn cat.
