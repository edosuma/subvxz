00:02.003 --> 00:03.459
Previously on Lost:

00:03.546 --> 00:05.502
You stole my kidney.

00:05.590 --> 00:09.003
You needed a father
and I needed a kidney. Get over it.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.837
[grunts]

00:10.928 --> 00:11.883
[crashing]

00:11.971 --> 00:13.927
[screams]

00:14.891 --> 00:16.631
I know you were raised in foster care,

00:16.726 --> 00:20.685
spent the four years prior to your
arrival on this island in a wheelchair,

00:20.771 --> 00:22.602
and I know how you ended up in it.

00:22.690 --> 00:28.651
What if I told you that somewhere
on this island there's a very large box,

00:28.738 --> 00:32.651
and whatever you imagined,
whatever you wanted to be in it,

00:32.742 --> 00:36.360
when you opened that box,
there it would be?

00:36.454 --> 00:40.538
I'd say I hope that box is big enough
to imagine yourself up a new submarine.

00:40.625 --> 00:41.740
[boom]

00:47.965 --> 00:50.001
You've really gone and done it now.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.129
You're not gonna start talking
about the magic box again?

00:53.221 --> 00:56.588
No, John. I'm gonna show you
what came out of it.

00:58.309 --> 01:00.425
Dad?

01:15.743 --> 01:20.533
[muffled groans]

01:22.708 --> 01:24.414
Save your breath.

01:26.796 --> 01:30.209
Nobody's gonna hear you.

01:43.646 --> 01:44.635
Dad?

01:44.730 --> 01:46.345
[panting]

01:49.860 --> 01:52.772
- What is this?
- You tell me.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.445
- You brought him here.
- I didn't bring him here.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.115
I'd be careful about
getting too close to him, John.

01:58.202 --> 02:01.694
Where did you find him?
Why did you bring him here?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.030
I've already said, we didn't.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.867
- Want me to ask him how he got here?
- Be my guest.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.919
- [growls and screams]
- Tom.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.332
I warned you, John.

02:16.679 --> 02:21.594
Don't you know, John?
Don't you know where we are?

02:26.897 --> 02:31.106
- What did he mean?
- We don't have time to deal with that.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.320
We're leaving in the morning, all of us.

02:33.404 --> 02:36.521
Where are you going?

02:36.615 --> 02:39.527
We're going to a new place.

02:39.618 --> 02:44.533
Well, an old place, actually.
Would you like to come with us?

02:51.255 --> 02:53.416
- Yes.
- Good.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.213
We're holding Kate
a few buildings over from here.

02:58.304 --> 03:01.592
Maybe you'd like to say goodbye.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.822
Hey, where you going?

03:26.916 --> 03:29.032
I can't sleep if I'm not in my own tent.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.118
Fine. Let's go to your tent.

03:38.469 --> 03:43.839
It's nothing personal,
just old habits, you know?

03:46.685 --> 03:48.721
Fine. Scram.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.100
You want me to walk you home?

03:53.484 --> 03:56.066
It's five tents. I think I'll make it.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.986
You sure? I gotta pee anyway.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.489
That is so romantic.

04:23.973 --> 04:26.715
What the hell y'all doing?

04:27.768 --> 04:31.306
- What the hell are you doing?
- Going to take a leak.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.056
Yeah, well, so are we.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.235
Well, alrighty, then.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.962
Hello, James.

05:27.411 --> 05:28.742
Wanna zip your pants up?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.581
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Looking for you, actually.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.584
OK, Tarzan, so now you're back

05:37.671 --> 05:41.289
from your "Blow up everything
that could get us off the island" tour,

05:41.383 --> 05:43.419
tell me why you joined up
with the enemy.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.628
I didn't join 'em. | infiltrated 'em.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.846
- You're undercover with the Others?
- That's right.

05:49.934 --> 05:53.426
How about you give me
one reason to believe that?

05:53.521 --> 05:57.639
Because a few hours ago, | snuck
into Ben's tent and kidnapped him.

05:59.735 --> 06:03.319
| tied him up,
dragged him off into the jungle.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.989
And you came all the way back here
to tell me this because...?

06:07.076 --> 06:12.537
Because this is the same man who
tortured you, beat you, humiliated you.

06:12.623 --> 06:16.115
And I want you to kill him.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.042
You want him dead, you kill him.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.419
- I'm not a murderer.
- Neither am |.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.173
Except for the man you killed in Sydney.

06:29.515 --> 06:33.554
They got files on us, James. All of us.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.394
Well, their files got their facts wrong.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.229
Then I made a mistake coming to you.

06:52.705 --> 06:55.492
Please don't tell anyone
that I was here.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.869
Hey, stopl

06:57.960 --> 07:00.451
I said stopl

07:02.631 --> 07:04.917
Damn it! Wait up.

07:20.024 --> 07:23.516
There. That ought to do it.

07:23.611 --> 07:28.230
Thanks. That would've taken me
hours to do myself.

07:28.324 --> 07:29.939
Glad I could help.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.862
Don't mind them.
They're all just excited you're here.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.700
- Excited?
- We've been waiting for you.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.706
John. You got a minute?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.334
- Yeah.
- Ben's asking for you.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.459
OK.

07:51.555 --> 07:55.093
[Juliet] Ben, itâ€™s 6am on
Saturday morning. Kwon is pregnant.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.893
The fetus is healthy and was conceived
on island with her husband.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.971
He was sterile before they got here.

08:02.066 --> 08:04.682
Hello, John. Thanks for coming.

08:05.861 --> 08:06.816
What's that?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.987
Juliet is gathering information
at your former camp.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.816
She's determining
if any of the women are pregnant.

08:12.910 --> 08:16.903
Then we're gonna go in and take them.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.791
Take them?

08:21.293 --> 08:25.252
This is not the first time we've done
this. Trust me, no one will get hurt.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.506
Could you pass me that, please?

08:33.514 --> 08:34.845
Thank you.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.181
I believe I have you
to thank for this, John.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.889
- Me?
- A week ago, I couldn't move my toes.

08:46.360 --> 08:52.026
But the minute you showed up,
I started to feel pins and needles.

08:52.116 --> 08:54.528
And this is only the beginning, John.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.280
I can't wait to show you
what this island can do.

08:58.288 --> 09:02.657
But, unfortunately,
you're not ready, John.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.501
- No, I'm ready.
- No, John, you're not.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.876
You're still crippled by the memories

09:09.967 --> 09:13.380
of the man you used to be
before you came to this island.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.804
You'll never be free until you release
the hold your father has over you.

09:20.144 --> 09:23.887
Why do you think you brought him here?

09:23.981 --> 09:26.063
The magic box.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.893
- OK, Ben, how about you show me the...
- Magic box is a metaphor, John.

09:29.987 --> 09:32.399
I can't show you anything
until you can show me

09:32.489 --> 09:34.320
that you're ready to be one of us.

09:34.408 --> 09:38.822
When people join us here on this island,
they need to make a gesture

09:38.912 --> 09:41.904
of free will, of commitment.

09:43.459 --> 09:46.496
That's why you're gonna
have to kill your father.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.858
Hey.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.652
- When did you get back?
- Jack, hey.

10:14.740 --> 10:18.232
Last night. Well, early this morning.

10:18.327 --> 10:23.242
So, camping, huh?
What were you guys doing out there?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.582
We figured we'd explore a bit,

10:26.668 --> 10:31.879
you know, see what was
further down the beach, male bonding.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.207
Well, next time you go out, sign me up.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.793
Yeah, next time, for sure.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.608
Thanks, Jin.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.811
- We have to tell Jack.
- Shouldn't he check out her wound?

10:55.906 --> 10:58.488
Can you give me your word
that Jack can be trusted,

10:58.575 --> 11:01.942
he spent ten days with those people
and nothing happened to him,

11:02.037 --> 11:04.528
- and that woman he's with...?
- Juliet?

11:04.623 --> 11:07.956
Aye, Juliet. Two weeks ago,
she had your friends in cages.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.412
Naomi. You heard everything
that she said.

11:14.550 --> 11:19.169
If we keep her safe,
she's our way off this island.

11:20.764 --> 11:25.724
So, given that,
do you trust Jack or don't you?

11:29.940 --> 11:34.775
Right. So we'd better bring in
someone we can trust.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.495
You should've put some shoes on.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.369
You think?

11:49.459 --> 11:52.292
So what else is in it?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.040
In what?

11:55.132 --> 11:57.123
The file they got on me.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.625
Not much.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.962
That your parents died
when you were very young.

12:04.057 --> 12:08.642
But it doesn't say
why your father shot your mother.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.181
Or why he turned the gun on himself.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.856
That must've been hard for you.

12:33.003 --> 12:36.040
- What else?
- High-school transcripts.

12:36.131 --> 12:40.841
Criminal record.
All the con jobs you were arrested for.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.260
I guess that's why
you use an alias, huh?

12:43.347 --> 12:45.087
Why did you choose the name Sawyer?

12:45.182 --> 12:46.388
[yells]

12:46.475 --> 12:50.093
How stupid do you think I am?
I already been conned by Ben once.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.929
Maybe you heard.
Bunny with a number painted on it?

12:53.023 --> 12:57.107
- You think I'm just gonna follow you?
- James, please. You have to trust me.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.027
Where are you taking me?
Tell me the truth.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.605
I'm bringing you there to do
exactly what I said, to kill Ben.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.611
- Why did you come to get me?
- I had to.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.284
- Why won't you do it yourself?
- James, please.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.956
Don't call me James.
Why won't you do it yourself?

13:12.042 --> 13:15.705
Because I can't! I can't! I can't do it!

13:19.341 --> 13:22.754
That's why I came back for you.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.687
Get up.

13:38.110 --> 13:42.103
I'll go to wherever you've got him, but
we're bringing him back to our camp.

13:42.197 --> 13:45.314
I ain't killin' nobody.
You understand me?

13:45.409 --> 13:48.492
Yeah, I understand.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.408
But you'll change your mind.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.960
When you hear what he has to say...

14:00.674 --> 14:02.460
...you'|l change your mind.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.400
Hey, dude.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.190
Hello, Hurley.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.700
Can you keep a secret?

14:45.510 --> 14:49.879
- You've already spoken to her?
- Yeah, but you're gonna wanna hear it.

14:49.973 --> 14:53.591
- And you haven't told Jack?
- No.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.676
Good.

15:07.032 --> 15:11.241
My name's Sayid Jarrah. I understand
your helicopter crashed onto the island.

15:11.328 --> 15:13.535
Actually, it crashed in the water.

15:14.748 --> 15:18.206
- What's your name?
- Naomi. Naomi Dorrit.

15:18.293 --> 15:21.410
Naomi, from where exactly
did you take off?

15:21.505 --> 15:23.746
A ship, freighter.

15:23.840 --> 15:28.425
About 80 nautical miles west of here.
I'm part of a search-and-recovery team.

15:28.512 --> 15:32.505
You told my friends the wreckage
of Flight 815 was discovered.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.682
- Did you mean the partial wreckage?
- No.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.431
They found the entire plane
off the coast of Bali,

15:38.522 --> 15:41.013
in an ocean trench four miles deep.

15:41.108 --> 15:45.477
They sent down cameras in
these little robots to survey the wreck.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.481
The bodies were all there.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.070
Well, obviously we're not dead.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.236
Obviously.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.323
So, if you weren't looking for us,
then who were you looking for?

15:59.417 --> 16:00.748
Him.

16:02.587 --> 16:03.576
Desmond?

16:03.672 --> 16:06.789
My company was hired by
a woman named Penelope Widmore.

16:06.883 --> 16:11.092
I don't know why. I never met her.
She gave us a set of coordinates.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.763
We've been conducting a differential
GPS grid search ever since.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.057
You knew about the island?

16:17.144 --> 16:21.137
Island? We were given coordinates
in the middle of the bloody ocean.

16:21.231 --> 16:25.725
We thought it was a fool's errand,
until three days ago.

16:25.819 --> 16:30.233
I was flying back for the ship
when the clouds cleared and I saw land.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.314
The instruments started spinning.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.993
I realized I was going down,
so I grabbed my chute and | bailed.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.324
Did you actually see her helicopter?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.829
- No.
- You think I'm lying, mate?

16:46.923 --> 16:50.791
You have no means of communicating
with that freighter of yours?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.174
What was your name? Sayid?

16:55.265 --> 16:56.596
Yes.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.685
Remind me not to rescue you, Sayid.

17:29.633 --> 17:31.669
[sighs]

17:36.890 --> 17:40.849
So, Ben. You said I'd kill him
when I heard what he's got to say.

17:40.936 --> 17:44.053
- That's right.
- Well, you wanna give me a heads-up?

17:44.147 --> 17:46.638
It's not really my place to tell you.

17:50.528 --> 17:53.861
Look, what you read in that file,

17:54.699 --> 17:56.781
about the guy in Sydney,

17:57.619 --> 17:59.405
I thought he was someone else.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.828
I made a mistake.
I didn't mean to kill him.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.165
Well, who'd you mean to kill?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.334
Are we almost there?

18:17.722 --> 18:19.758
Almost.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.733
Wake up, John.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.941
It's time.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.724
I know it won't be easy,
but the quicker the better.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.567
You're kidding me, right?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.988
You expect him to kill me?

19:25.540 --> 19:29.954
John, the hesitation that you're feeling
is just the part of you

19:30.045 --> 19:33.128
that still feels like he has
a perfectly good explanation

19:33.214 --> 19:37.332
for stealing your kidney, throwing you
out of an eight-story window.

19:38.136 --> 19:41.003
Don't you wanna be free from him?

19:41.097 --> 19:44.430
The hesitation he's feeling
is because he is a spineless...

19:44.517 --> 19:46.382
Shut up!

19:53.777 --> 19:56.109
- I gotta think.
- Don't think, John.

19:56.196 --> 19:59.688
You're wasting your time, Bug-Eye.
We've been through all this.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.071
- All he wants is his daddy.
- Shut up! I said shut up!

20:07.207 --> 20:10.199
You really haven't figured it out yet,
have you?

20:12.629 --> 20:15.621
Let go of him, John.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.383
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You're doing this to yourself.

20:20.470 --> 20:24.884
As long as he's still breathing,
you'll still be that same sad,

20:24.974 --> 20:28.387
pathetic little man
that was kicked off his walkabout tour

20:28.478 --> 20:31.311
because you couldn't walk.

20:55.130 --> 20:59.089
I'll be here the rest of the week, John,
if you change your mind.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.806
I'm sorry.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.270
He's not who we thought he was.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.198
Son of a...

22:25.386 --> 22:27.877
Nice place you got here, Locke.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.299
Ben's inside in the brig.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.384
You ready?

22:35.939 --> 22:37.930
Yeah, I'm ready.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.247
Friends of yours?

23:00.338 --> 23:03.876
It's an old slaving ship.
Mid 19th century.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.173
My guess is they captured the slaves,

23:13.268 --> 23:16.385
and brought them here
to try and mine the island.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.808
- What's in the boxes?
- That'd be dynamite.

23:28.116 --> 23:32.826
Son of a bitch.
You really kidnapped the little bastard.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.244
We ain't killing him, Locke.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.327
Whatever you say, James.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.640
Well, well, well.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.057
[door slams]

24:06.029 --> 24:09.521
Heyl What are you doing?
Open the damn doorl

24:09.616 --> 24:11.857
- [muffled screams]
- Shut up! Open up!

24:13.745 --> 24:15.986
I said shut up!

24:21.836 --> 24:24.293
Who the hell are you?

24:28.551 --> 24:31.588
- Is that like a radio?
- It's like a radio, yes.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.056
I've never seen equipment
this sophisticated.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.428
- But you can still make it work, right?
- I hope so.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.053
And what about the other part?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.605
The part about they found the plane
and we're all dead.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.353
One thing at a time.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.228
[squeal]

24:50.323 --> 24:53.360
[beeps and static]

24:53.451 --> 24:55.487
There's not a single audible channel.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.569
Whatever that interference is,

24:57.664 --> 25:01.498
it's blocking our ability
to send our own transmission. If we...

25:01.584 --> 25:03.870
What's that? Is that a radio?

25:05.004 --> 25:08.121
- Where'd you get it?
- The luggage.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.502
What, you just found a radio
in the luggage?

25:10.593 --> 25:15.337
Kate, if I explain,
I want you to keep this very quiet.

25:16.391 --> 25:18.006
Keep what very quiet?

25:19.102 --> 25:20.558
[Sawyer banging]

25:20.645 --> 25:25.264
[Sawyer] Locke!
Open this damn door! Open it up!

25:25.358 --> 25:27.519
I can hear you, you bald bastard!

25:27.610 --> 25:29.601
[door creaks]

25:32.740 --> 25:34.605
Rousseau.

25:35.326 --> 25:36.486
Locke.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.659
[Sawyer knocking]

25:38.746 --> 25:43.536
- What brings you to the Black Rock?
- Dynamite. And you?

25:43.626 --> 25:45.491
[Sawyer] Open this door!

25:46.629 --> 25:48.790
Open up!

25:52.176 --> 25:54.508
Crates are right over there.

25:57.432 --> 26:01.050
- [Sawyer] Open this damn door!
- [Locke] Be careful. It's unstable.

26:01.811 --> 26:04.803
[Sawyer banging]

26:07.316 --> 26:09.443
[Sawyer] Locke! Locke!

26:22.248 --> 26:26.161
[Richard] Beautiful, isn't it? No matter
how much time you spend on the island,

26:26.252 --> 26:28.243
you just never get tired of this view.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.795
We haven't been formally introduced.
I'm Richard.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.089
- You mind if I join you here?
- Sure.

26:43.144 --> 26:46.682
- He wanted to embarrass you.
- I'm sorry?

26:46.773 --> 26:49.936
Ben knew you weren't gonna
kill your own father.

26:50.818 --> 26:53.434
He put you in front
of everyone in our camp

26:53.529 --> 26:56.191
just so they could all watch you fail.

26:56.908 --> 26:57.897
VVhy?

27:01.996 --> 27:05.909
When word got back here that there was
a man with a broken spine on the plane

27:06.000 --> 27:10.118
who could suddenly walk again, well,
people here began to get very excited,

27:10.213 --> 27:16.209
because that could only happen
to someone who was extremely special.

27:18.930 --> 27:21.967
But Ben doesn't want anyone
to think you're special, John.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.764
And why are you telling me this?

27:25.228 --> 27:30.973
Ben has been wasting our time
with novelties like fertility problems.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.308
We're looking for someone to remind us

27:33.402 --> 27:35.984
that we're here
for more important reasons.

27:37.949 --> 27:41.237
- What do you want from me?
- I want for you to find your purpose.

27:41.327 --> 27:45.912
And to do that,
your father has to go, John.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.865
And since you're not gonna do it...

27:55.424 --> 27:57.551
...|'m gonna suggest someone else.

28:02.390 --> 28:07.009
Sawyer? Why would Sawyer kill my father?
He doesn't even know him.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.593
Keep reading.

28:13.401 --> 28:17.269
Open this damn door! Son of a bitch!

28:17.363 --> 28:18.978
[muffled screams]

28:26.747 --> 28:31.241
I'm pointing my gun at you, John Boy.
You got three seconds to open this door.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.210
You're not gonna shoot anyone, James.

28:35.381 --> 28:39.215
One! Two!

28:39.302 --> 28:43.636
If there were any bullets in that gun,
why would you hold a knife to my throat?

28:47.977 --> 28:52.516
- Son of a bitch!
- Guess I didn't raise no dummies.

28:52.607 --> 28:54.188
What the hell's that mean?

28:54.275 --> 28:58.018
It means that bald-headed bastard
outside the door is my son.

29:00.197 --> 29:05.191
- Come again?
- My son, as in, I'm his father.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.777
- You do speak English?
- You're his...

29:12.919 --> 29:16.958
- How did you get here, to the island?
- Island?

29:17.673 --> 29:21.257
OK. I'm driving down I-1O
through Tallahassee,

29:21.344 --> 29:24.711
when, bam, somebody slams
into the back of my car.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.932
I go right into the divider
at 70 miles an hour.

29:30.019 --> 29:33.386
Next thing I know, the paramedics
are strapping me to a gurney,

29:33.481 --> 29:35.096
stuffing me in an ambulance,

29:35.191 --> 29:39.434
and one of them actually smiles at me
as he pops the I.V. in my arm.

29:39.528 --> 29:44.113
And then nothing, just black.

29:45.660 --> 29:49.699
And the next thing I know, I wake up in
a dark room, tied up, gag in my mouth.

29:49.789 --> 29:54.453
And when the door opens, I'm looking up
at the same man I threw out a window,

29:54.543 --> 29:57.125
John Locke,

29:57.213 --> 29:59.670
my dead son.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.761
Dead 'cause you threw him out a window?

30:11.852 --> 30:14.343
No, he survived that.

30:14.438 --> 30:18.101
But it paralyzed him, permanently.

30:18.192 --> 30:22.856
He's dead because the plane
he was flying on crashed in the Pacific.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.819
Well, I got bad news for you, Pops,

30:27.910 --> 30:31.118
'cause I was on that plane
with your son.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.161
He sure as hell wasn't crippled.

30:33.249 --> 30:36.833
And we didn't crash in the Pacific.
We crashed here on this island.

30:36.919 --> 30:40.662
- You sure it's an island?
- Well, what else is it?

30:40.756 --> 30:43.668
Little hot for heaven, isn't it?

30:45.469 --> 30:48.506
Oh. OK. So we're dead?

30:48.597 --> 30:51.134
They found your plane
on the bottom of the ocean.

30:52.893 --> 30:56.932
One minute I'm in a car wreck, the next
I'm in a pirate ship in the jungle?

30:57.023 --> 31:02.234
If this isn't hell, friend,
then where are we?

31:03.612 --> 31:06.649
[sighs]

31:08.117 --> 31:11.701
- Why did you throw Locke out a window?
- He was becoming a nuisance.

31:14.623 --> 31:17.239
I conned him into giving me
one of his kidneys.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.666
He never got over it.

31:21.130 --> 31:24.213
- Conned?
- Yes, sir.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.291
Conned.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.806
What's your name?

31:34.977 --> 31:40.142
- Your name.
- A con man goes by many names, friend.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.065
I've been Alan Seward, Anthony Cooper,

31:43.152 --> 31:47.316
Ted MacLaren, Tom Sawyer,
Louis Jackson, Paul...

31:47.406 --> 31:49.692
Tom Sawyer?

31:49.784 --> 31:52.491
I was young and Huck Finn was taken.

31:53.162 --> 31:57.155
And the ladies loved that one.
Made me charming.

32:02.129 --> 32:04.506
Well, how about that?

32:05.925 --> 32:07.586
How about what?

32:10.346 --> 32:12.337
Sawyer's my name, too.

32:36.205 --> 32:39.163
Ben, what's going on?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.616
- We're moving.
- Moving? Where are we going?

32:41.710 --> 32:45.919
"We" are not going anywhere, John.
You are going to stay behind.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.463
You both are going to stay behind.

32:48.551 --> 32:51.293
What? You're not taking him?

32:51.387 --> 32:53.924
He's your mess, John.
Why would we clean it up?

32:54.014 --> 32:56.471
Ben, if you're trying to embarrass me...

32:56.559 --> 32:59.392
Where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that?

33:00.312 --> 33:02.519
You can't leave me. After everything...

33:02.606 --> 33:05.268
Don't tell me what I can't do, John.

33:08.529 --> 33:11.316
But I thought I was special.

33:13.826 --> 33:16.317
Well, everyone makes mistakes.

33:19.582 --> 33:23.370
We're leaving now.
We'll leave a trail, one you can track.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.711
And, John...

33:25.963 --> 33:29.000
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back,

33:30.092 --> 33:31.753
don't bother.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.667
What's the matter with you?

34:07.796 --> 34:10.378
You ever been to Jasper, Alabama?

34:12.176 --> 34:13.507
VVhy?

34:13.594 --> 34:16.210
Have you or haven't you?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.342
Yeah, I've been to Jasper.

34:19.975 --> 34:22.591
Don't tell me I'm your daddy.

34:23.479 --> 34:28.314
No. You killed my daddy.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.916
Read it.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.796
"Dear Mr. Sawyer..."

35:02.351 --> 35:04.967
- What is this?
- Just read it.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.185
"You don't know who I am,

35:10.276 --> 35:15.236
but I know who you are,
and I know what you done."

35:15.322 --> 35:18.405
"You had sex with my mother

35:18.492 --> 35:22.201
and then you stole
my dad's money all away,

35:22.288 --> 35:26.952
so he got angry and he killed my mother

35:27.042 --> 35:30.785
and then he killed himself."

35:30.879 --> 35:32.415
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

35:34.508 --> 35:39.593
So, what, is this supposed to be you?
You wrote this letter?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.307
Hey, wait a second.

35:43.350 --> 35:47.184
Did you take my name because you were
on some kind of revenge kick?

35:49.273 --> 35:52.060
- Keep reading.
- Easy, easy.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.483
Don't get all worked up.

35:54.570 --> 36:00.190
Look, I ran that con two dozen times.
If your mother was one of the ladies...

36:00.284 --> 36:01.899
Mary.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.820
Her name was Mary.

36:08.792 --> 36:12.330
Mary from Jasper, Alabama.

36:12.421 --> 36:15.083
Yeah, I remember her.

36:16.133 --> 36:19.921
She practically begged me
to take her $38,000

36:20.012 --> 36:22.924
and to rescue her
from her sorry little life.

36:24.933 --> 36:28.767
- Finish the letter.
- Look, I only took her money.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.015
It ain't my fault your dad overreacted.

36:31.106 --> 36:35.395
If he pulled the old murder/suicide,
then I'm sure he's down here somewhere.

36:35.486 --> 36:37.477
Maybe you could take this up with him.

36:37.571 --> 36:39.402
- Finish it!

36:42.117 --> 36:43.152
OK.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.693
OK.

36:51.251 --> 36:52.411
[growls]

36:56.298 --> 36:57.333
[chokes and gasps]

36:57.424 --> 37:00.757
You wanna go to hell?
You wanna go to hell?

37:07.976 --> 37:12.936
- [grunts]
- [chokes]

37:25.160 --> 37:27.776
[door creaks]

37:50.811 --> 37:52.472
Thank you.

37:59.778 --> 38:03.612
- You missing those cheeseburgers yet?
- Only every second.

38:06.368 --> 38:07.949
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.651
I need to talk to you.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.195
OK.

38:12.291 --> 38:14.452
- In private.
- No problem.

38:14.543 --> 38:16.955
Anything you wanna say,
say in front of her.

38:17.045 --> 38:19.206
- Not this.
- It's OK.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.710
No, no, no, no. You can stay.

38:23.385 --> 38:27.503
Yeah, you should stay. Seems only fair,
considering that she's the reason

38:27.598 --> 38:30.556
no one wants to tell you
there's a woman in Hurley's tent

38:30.642 --> 38:33.054
who parachuted
onto the island yesterday.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.727
- What?
- A woman jumped from her chopper.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.147
She says the boat she took off from
is about 80 miles off the coast

38:39.234 --> 38:42.601
and that if she can find a way
to contact it, we'll all be rescued.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.903
Why didn't anyone tell me this?

38:46.283 --> 38:49.616
Nobody told you
because they don't trust you.

38:57.753 --> 39:00.460
- How?
- How what?

39:00.547 --> 39:03.664
- How does she contact her boat?
- Did you hear what I said?

39:03.759 --> 39:06.341
Hurley, Charlie, Sayid,
your friends, are afraid...

39:06.428 --> 39:08.965
Kate! How?

39:14.019 --> 39:18.888
She had a phone-radio thing.
Sayid's trying to get it to work.

39:22.236 --> 39:23.692
We should tell her.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.523
- No.
- Tell me what?

39:28.617 --> 39:31.404
- We should tell her.
- Not yet.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.789
[coughs and gags]

39:56.436 --> 39:58.427
You can go back now.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.680
Why did you do this?

40:03.735 --> 40:07.648
He ruined my life. And he ruined yours.

40:11.243 --> 40:12.983
And he had it coming.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.411
- Juliet is a mole.
- What?

40:20.502 --> 40:24.586
She's working for Ben. He sent her back
to find out which women were pregnant.

40:24.673 --> 40:28.541
Three days from now there's gonna be
a raid, and they're gonna take them.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.047
They say they don't want anyone
to get hurt.

40:32.806 --> 40:35.764
- Why are you telling me this?
- So you can warn the camp.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.307
You warn the camp.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.226
I'm not going back.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.770
You're going back undercover?

40:44.359 --> 40:47.522
No, I was never undercover, James.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.979
I'm on my own journey now.

40:51.700 --> 40:54.487
Even if Juliet is a mole,
they ain't gonna believe me.

40:54.578 --> 40:57.035
I've been saying that
since she showed up.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.413
They'll believe you now.

41:05.589 --> 41:06.920
Hey.

41:08.967 --> 41:10.798
Is it true?

41:11.887 --> 41:15.550
- Is what true?
- That he threw you out a window.

41:18.518 --> 41:21.430
That you were a cripple.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.555
Not anymore.
