HARRY:
But the service isn't that fast.

00:06.540 --> 00:10.310
Believe me. you guys are gonna flip
over the sushi in this place.

00:10.477 --> 00:12.337
Hey. come in. everybody.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.966
Excuse me. wasn't this
a Japanese restaurant yesterday?

00:16.148 --> 00:19.678
Say. you got the sharp eye for detail.
don't you?

00:19.852 --> 00:20.982
So I've been told.

00:21.153 --> 00:25.323
My name is Panayoti Shakelaris.
but everybody call me Papa Jack.

00:25.624 --> 00:27.824
-Why?
-Why?

00:27.993 --> 00:29.653
[LAUGHS]

00:30.161 --> 00:31.651
I don't know why.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.433
Follow me. please.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.028
What an amusing anecdote.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.000
PAPA JACK:
That's a nice table for you.

00:37.168 --> 00:38.998
Sit. Eat.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.830
Sing. Dance. Enjoy.

00:42.006 --> 00:44.336
You're gonna make us have fun.
aren't you?

00:44.509 --> 00:48.069
-Boy. neat menus.
-It's all Greek to me.

00:48.246 --> 00:49.706
[LAUGHS]

00:51.114 --> 00:54.144
-Is he dangerous?
-No. we'll be fine. thanks.

00:54.317 --> 00:57.717
Guys. wait.
I'll bring special treat for you.

00:58.053 --> 00:59.923
Excuse me.

01:03.592 --> 01:05.692
Did you put a piece of lettuce
in your pocket?

01:05.861 --> 01:08.351
It's for Harvey. My new pet.

01:09.297 --> 01:12.957
Lettuce? Harvey? I get it.
Big. tough Bull's got little pet bunny.

01:13.401 --> 01:14.931
Actually. Harvey's a python.

01:16.136 --> 01:17.126
Oh.

01:17.304 --> 01:18.864
I feed him bunnies. though.

01:19.874 --> 01:22.074
-Could I watch sometime?
-Oh. fellas. please.

01:22.243 --> 01:25.583
Harry. you'd love to see a snake
eat a bunny as much as I would.

01:26.013 --> 01:30.383
-I hope that everybody's hungry.
-Oh. boy. my favorite. Fire.

01:30.551 --> 01:33.681
Hey. this must be the souvlaki.

01:33.854 --> 01:36.654
No. souvlaki doesn't throb.

01:36.824 --> 01:38.994
That's very interesting. What is it?

01:39.158 --> 01:41.678
This is the brand-new specialty
of the house.

01:42.095 --> 01:44.755
Squid swimming in an olive oil base...

01:44.931 --> 01:47.661
...dripping with kasseri and feta cheese...

01:47.834 --> 01:50.864
...bubb|ing over noodles and pine nuts...

01:51.036 --> 01:54.696
...covered in a simmering
lemon garlic sauce.

01:55.674 --> 01:57.774
I'll take scrambled eggs.

01:58.876 --> 02:01.866
Come on. everybody. eat up.

02:04.048 --> 02:08.678
Come on. guys. No reason not to try
something just because it's new. right?

02:09.787 --> 02:11.917
Oh. I can't believe what chickens
you guys are.

02:12.089 --> 02:16.029
Come on. food is not just something to eat.
it's something to celebrate.

02:17.361 --> 02:18.891
Have a ball.

02:26.870 --> 02:29.600
So. what's the verdict?

02:32.208 --> 02:35.198
IGROANINGI

03:28.597 --> 03:30.187
Tell me if this hurts.

03:30.365 --> 03:31.825
-Nope.
-This?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.090
Uh-uh.

03:33.267 --> 03:35.167
Oh. come on. that tickles.
Come on. come--

03:35.336 --> 03:37.266
Ow! Oh! Ooh. ha.

03:37.772 --> 03:39.602
Hi. guys. Hi. how you doing?
Come on in.

03:39.774 --> 03:41.264
BILLIE: How is he?
-Oh. I'm fine.

03:41.442 --> 03:44.102
The man says I got a little pain
in my tummy. that's all.

03:44.278 --> 03:48.308
That's not what I said. judge. This doesn't
sound like simple indigestion to me.

03:48.483 --> 03:52.483
In my opinion.
you should see a doctor right away.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.380
-Well. you're a doctor. aren't you?
-Gynecologist.

03:57.556 --> 03:59.116
[DAN LAUGHS]

03:59.291 --> 04:02.351
You people are lucky
I happened to be eating in that place.

04:02.528 --> 04:05.498
I appreciate that.
but you're a little of out of your league.

04:05.664 --> 04:08.104
Let's just say
his league has a lower strike zone.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.897
I'm sorry. it was so easy.

04:12.070 --> 04:15.130
-How often do you get these pains. judge?
-Oh. every now and then.

04:15.306 --> 04:16.526
Once a week? Once a day?

04:16.707 --> 04:18.767
Let him know
when they're five minutes apart.

04:18.942 --> 04:20.742
Dan.

04:20.911 --> 04:24.011
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.381
I'm afraid I can't do anything more.
Your Honor.

04:26.550 --> 04:28.750
You really should be seen by a specialist.

04:28.919 --> 04:31.939
I mean. it's been years since I--

04:32.121 --> 04:34.351
Been with a man?

04:34.757 --> 04:37.017
It is easy.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.660
If I were you. judge. I'd get myself
down to a hospital for some tests.

04:41.830 --> 04:44.700
No time. doc.
I got places to go. people to convict.

04:44.866 --> 04:47.296
I think you're making a big mistake.

04:47.469 --> 04:50.909
But. then. I just did this for free.

04:51.840 --> 04:52.930
Are you crazy?

04:53.108 --> 04:54.738
You vomited. doubled-up in pain...

04:54.910 --> 04:57.540
...a doctor tells you go to the hospital.
you do nothing.

04:57.713 --> 04:59.553
Believe it or not.

04:59.715 --> 05:02.675
-Harry. |isten--
-Come on. give me credit for some sense.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.510
I don't have to go to the hospital.

05:04.684 --> 05:07.284
What a bunch of gloomy gusses.

05:07.453 --> 05:09.083
[GROANS]

05:09.254 --> 05:11.254
Hey. nice shoes. Selma.

05:12.524 --> 05:15.964
Thanks. They're orthopedic.

05:16.128 --> 05:18.358
Let's go back to work. huh. guys?

05:18.530 --> 05:20.260
Your Honor...

05:20.598 --> 05:22.618
...if anything should happen to you....

05:23.266 --> 05:28.226
-I'll see you get my parking space.
-Oh. great. thank you. Take care. sir.

05:28.839 --> 05:31.969
The truth.
When's the last time you saw a doctor?

05:32.242 --> 05:33.612
Thirty. 40 seconds ago.

05:33.776 --> 05:36.176
-Before that?
-Third grade.

05:36.345 --> 05:37.935
I almost lost part of my ear.

05:38.113 --> 05:41.053
Showing off in school.
Got my head stuck in the heating duct.

05:41.216 --> 05:43.306
-Harry--
-Shou|d've taken off the vent.

05:43.485 --> 05:46.045
-Now. Harry. just listen to me.
-I just read a book...

05:46.221 --> 05:50.051
...by a guy who cured a serious illness
with laughter. It was terrific.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.564
He just watched
old comedy movies. cartoons...

05:52.726 --> 05:54.786
...anything that would make him laugh.

05:54.962 --> 05:58.492
You know what they say.
"Laughter is the best medicine."

05:59.733 --> 06:02.403
-See? I feel better already.
-Great.

06:03.737 --> 06:06.327
You don't wanna listen
to common sense.

06:06.839 --> 06:09.169
I'll be right there. I just--

06:09.475 --> 06:11.905
I gotta powder my nose.

06:21.554 --> 06:24.184
You okay. Your Honor?
Heard you had a little problem.

06:24.357 --> 06:27.817
-Never felt better. big guy.
-Well. good. good.

06:27.994 --> 06:29.294
Hey. Mac?

06:29.461 --> 06:32.861
-Wanna know what I've been thinking?
-Well. now you know I do. sir.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.830
I read that the Detroit Lions
have a new stadium.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.360
They got a dome. Mac.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.690
Isn't that a breath of fresh air. sir.

06:40.870 --> 06:44.070
Anyway. now you could have the Lions
hosting the Chicago Bears.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.710
Then. the Detroit baseball team
could be playing.

06:46.876 --> 06:48.936
And then you know who's all playing
at once?

06:49.112 --> 06:53.242
-Lions and Tigers and Bears.
-Oh. my.

06:54.950 --> 06:56.350
Great stuff. huh. Mac?

06:56.518 --> 07:00.508
Yeah. you just keep setting them up.
and I'll keep bringing them home. sir.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.747
You're hurting.
Why don't you recess for the evening?

07:05.926 --> 07:09.616
I saw a doctor. He said I have a little
problem with my tummy. That's all.

07:10.029 --> 07:13.399
Your Honor. my cousin had a little problem
with his tummy for six years.

07:13.566 --> 07:17.496
They finally operated. found the problem.
He's been the picture of health ever since.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.200
See? You're not alone.
It happens to a lot of people.

07:20.539 --> 07:24.999
Not really. They found out my cousin
had been carrying his unborn twin brother.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.341
-That's disgusting.
-It wasn't very big.

07:28.513 --> 07:30.383
-Stop.
-There was no reason to name him.

07:30.548 --> 07:33.518
All right. move along. people. huh?

07:34.117 --> 07:37.417
-What is that stench?
-That's our first case. Your Honor.

07:37.855 --> 07:42.015
Edward Antoine and Philip Falcone.

07:45.762 --> 07:47.032
What's the problem?

07:47.197 --> 07:50.287
Well. I just got fed up with the noise.
Your Honor. that's all.

07:50.467 --> 07:52.057
Every week. for six years...

07:52.235 --> 07:54.795
...this bozo comes by
with his lousy sanitation truck...

07:54.971 --> 07:56.271
...at 5:00 in the morning.

07:56.438 --> 07:58.738
You get a jump on the morning rush.

07:59.073 --> 08:02.013
Your Honor. they're charging each other
with aggravated assault.

08:02.176 --> 08:06.506
Your Honor. if I may.
it seems that the story unfolds as follows:

08:06.680 --> 08:09.170
-Pace. woman. pace.
-Apparently. Mr. Antoine got up...

08:09.350 --> 08:12.650
-...went outside and demanded an apology.
-He threw a dead cat at me.

08:12.820 --> 08:14.790
I didn't know what was in that shoebox.

08:14.955 --> 08:17.945
At which point. Mr. Antoine
took Mr. Fa|cone's patio furniture...

08:18.125 --> 08:20.855
...put it in his crusher.
and turned it into linguine.

08:21.028 --> 08:22.088
Mr. Antoine jumped him.

08:22.263 --> 08:25.323
When police arrived. they had been
rolling in swill for 10 minutes.

08:25.499 --> 08:29.769
They've been in the holding cell
since 7:00 this morning. fermenting.

08:29.937 --> 08:33.457
Your Honor. I've been picking filth and scum
out of my clothes all day long.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.801
Rancid dog food. used dental floss...

08:36.142 --> 08:40.102
...and this is what olive loaf turns into
after a couple weeks.

08:40.280 --> 08:45.050
Yeah. the lavender fuzz
kind of gives it away.

08:47.253 --> 08:49.283
Whoops.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.382
[GROANS]

08:53.925 --> 08:55.385
Found it.

08:55.559 --> 08:56.919
Harry. what is it?

08:57.093 --> 08:58.393
A pencil. Ever seen one?

08:58.560 --> 09:00.120
You are sick. see a doctor.

09:00.296 --> 09:02.126
Leave me alone. Miss Young.

09:02.298 --> 09:04.788
See? See? We can all get upset. huh?

09:04.967 --> 09:07.727
But while you're sitting up there.
all nice and comfy...

09:07.903 --> 09:12.343
...there's guys like me down in the trenches
who are shoveling your sludge all day.

09:12.508 --> 09:15.438
-Perhaps you could speed up--
-And then you got guys like him...

09:15.611 --> 09:19.811
...a|ways putting you down.
ripping my guts out. bit by bit.

09:20.215 --> 09:22.045
For 15 years. they've been at it.

09:22.217 --> 09:24.977
Just slowly twisting that knife
in my belly.

09:25.154 --> 09:27.184
-Mr. Fa|cone--
-You got any idea how that must feel?

09:27.355 --> 09:28.945
[YELLS]

09:29.122 --> 09:31.452
Exactly.

09:59.952 --> 10:02.282
Yeah. keep me posted on that. huh?

10:02.455 --> 10:06.945
Sure. I always keep my roommates informed
of their potential entertainment selections.

10:07.126 --> 10:08.746
-Listen. mister--
-|'m Kenny.

10:08.928 --> 10:10.898

10:11.063 --> 10:12.593
OkaY-

10:13.931 --> 10:16.161
I love these beds.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.603
They go up and down. you know?

10:19.336 --> 10:22.166
I love the sheets too.
We get them fresh every morning.

10:22.339 --> 10:25.599
And I love the doctors and nurses
who keep stopping by to say hello.

10:25.776 --> 10:27.066
And the smell of antiseptic.

10:28.511 --> 10:31.811
And the food.
Tomorrow we get muffins and juice at 6:00.

10:35.118 --> 10:37.418
I love the walls.

10:42.858 --> 10:45.728
You all have to be patient.
I'm really doing everything I can.

10:45.894 --> 10:47.594
-That's all you can tell us?
-Listen.

10:47.763 --> 10:51.723
All we know that we know is he has all
the classic symptoms of duodenal distress.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.200
-Duodenal distress?
-Possible ulcer.

10:55.370 --> 10:57.070
Thank you.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.969
The problem is
he refuses to submit to any tests.

11:00.142 --> 11:01.172
That's unbelievable.

11:01.343 --> 11:03.743
The ER specialist recommends
an immediate endoscopy.

11:03.912 --> 11:05.612
-Now that's--
-The oral insertion...

11:05.781 --> 11:09.221
...of a miniature probe
to detect specific intestina|--

11:09.384 --> 11:11.654
I'm sorry. you were saying?

11:12.788 --> 11:18.278
The oral insertion of a miniature probe
to detect specific intestinal...

11:19.194 --> 11:20.424
...things.

11:22.162 --> 11:24.532
-How old are you?
-Thirty-one.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.857
I've got underwear older than that.

11:30.669 --> 11:32.539
Oh. there'll be no smoking in this wing.

11:32.704 --> 11:35.304
-Oh. I'll be in the lounge.
-No smoking in the lounge.

11:35.740 --> 11:39.800
I'll be out front sitting in the street.

11:44.248 --> 11:46.908
You're the third person in that bed
in two days.

11:49.887 --> 11:50.907
What happened?

11:51.322 --> 11:54.222
The angel of death took them all.

11:55.626 --> 11:58.816
Here's to you
making it through the night.

12:01.899 --> 12:03.089
-Hi.
-Oh. hi. guys.

-How you feeling?

12:05.403 --> 12:06.843
Are you kidding? Never better.

12:07.004 --> 12:09.444
Then what was all that
screaming about. Harry?

12:09.607 --> 12:12.197
-Take a nap. Kenny.
-Sure.

12:12.609 --> 12:15.579
Judge Stone. you must have
the tests I've indicated.

12:15.744 --> 12:17.344
No sale. doc.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.582
Let me handle this.

12:20.515 --> 12:22.135
Handle what?

12:23.250 --> 12:25.720
When I was a child.
my mother told me this story...

12:25.886 --> 12:27.976
...and I'd like to pass it on to you.

12:28.155 --> 12:30.385
It seems there was this...

12:31.892 --> 12:33.192
...e|f.

12:33.359 --> 12:36.489
And he had to go the hospital
because he had pains in his stomach...

12:36.662 --> 12:41.462
...and he refused
to take the tests. and. uh...

12:41.634 --> 12:42.664
...he died.

12:43.970 --> 12:46.170
That stinks.

12:47.573 --> 12:50.543
Why didn't anybody stop me?
Couldn't you see I was over my head?

12:50.709 --> 12:55.409
Harry. for heaven's sakes. do what
this guy wants. and take the tests.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.210
Can't do it. Didn't study.

12:57.382 --> 12:59.372
[LAUGHING]

13:01.953 --> 13:03.923
That's very funny.

13:04.089 --> 13:05.989
-Didn't study.
-Hello. Mr. Beilin.

13:06.158 --> 13:08.178
KENNY:
Hello. hello. doctor. How are you?

13:08.359 --> 13:12.419
-And how are we feeling this evening?
-Oh. I'm in agony. doctor.

13:12.596 --> 13:16.056
-Oh?
-I think I'm having a stroke.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.870
Gosh. I'm sorry to hear that.
You want some juice?

13:20.237 --> 13:21.757
Well. if you think it would help.

13:22.839 --> 13:24.809
I'm sure it will.

13:25.041 --> 13:27.601
How about cran-apple. if you have any.

13:28.611 --> 13:30.641
Uh. what's with him?

13:30.812 --> 13:31.872
Munchausen syndrome.

13:32.047 --> 13:35.477
It's essentially a psychosomatic condition.
The patient wanders...

13:35.651 --> 13:39.211
...from hospital to hospital. claiming
to suffer from a variety of illnesses.

13:39.388 --> 13:42.448
In reality. it's merely a ploy for attention
by lonely people.

13:42.624 --> 13:45.394
I've read studies that indicate
several of these patients...

13:45.561 --> 13:48.831
...are quite intelligent.
despite their superficial histrionics.

13:48.997 --> 13:55.097
Their subconscious motivations stem from
a lack of stable interpersonal relationships.

13:56.971 --> 13:59.801
You're all like this. aren't you?

14:00.808 --> 14:05.138
Oh. hey. kid. would you get me some
of that juice out there? Thanks. babe. Hey.

14:05.713 --> 14:07.413
Hey. gang-

14:08.783 --> 14:10.273
How are you feeling. sir?

14:10.451 --> 14:14.051
Well. despite what everyone seems
to believe. I am feeling great.

14:14.222 --> 14:17.522
Terrific. Hey. look what I got
in the gift shop.

14:17.692 --> 14:18.852
Hey. nice watch.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.515
Dan. you really shouldn't have.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.155
Why the hell not?
I've always wanted one.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.954
Got you some Chiclets.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.531
So you going under the knife
or what?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.474
As a matter of fact. I'm going home.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.729
Okay. everybody out.

14:35.908 --> 14:40.568
-I would like a minute alone with him.
-You're gonna get it now. Harry.

14:40.746 --> 14:45.836
Oh. hey. guys. Come on. I found out
where the nurses change.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.988
So? What do you wanna talk about?

14:51.490 --> 14:53.890
How about nuclear arms reduction?

14:54.059 --> 14:55.119
Sir. please.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.164
Oh. gotcha. it's too heavy.

14:57.329 --> 14:59.799
How about the year
those Cubbies had. huh?

15:00.299 --> 15:02.289
-Excuse us. won't you?
-Sure.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.898
_Bye, Harry.
-Bye, Kenny.

15:06.305 --> 15:08.465
Well. you got a great bedside manner.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.660
And you got a big space
between your ears.

15:10.841 --> 15:12.001
Billie. I'm fine.

15:12.174 --> 15:14.614
That's why they brought you here
in an ambulance.

15:14.777 --> 15:17.067
Well. it was fun.
They let Bull work the siren.

15:17.245 --> 15:20.575
-Come on. Harry.
-Billie. I appreciate your concern.

15:20.749 --> 15:24.309
Really. I do. But trust me. I'm fine.

15:27.155 --> 15:29.245
-Really.
-Get back in that bed.

15:29.424 --> 15:30.764
No.

15:33.762 --> 15:36.062
Now. normally I would
consider this fun. but--

15:36.230 --> 15:39.530
-Harry. You are sick. Just say it.
-Okay. I'm sick.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.190
-Then you'll take the tests?
-No.

15:41.368 --> 15:42.728
What is it? Are you scared?

15:42.902 --> 15:45.672
-I'm scared? Come on. don't be silly.
-You are. aren't you?

15:45.838 --> 15:49.038
That is ridiculous. Why in the world
would you say I'm scared?

15:49.208 --> 15:50.838
Harry?

15:53.646 --> 15:55.406
It's getting stuffy in here.

15:55.581 --> 15:57.641
Then stop breathing.

15:58.017 --> 15:59.747
I'll try that.

16:01.385 --> 16:06.405
Okay. Okay. maybe I am a little scared.

16:06.590 --> 16:09.180
Well. it's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.329
Everybody's scared
when they come in here.

16:11.494 --> 16:13.224
I know my father was.

16:13.395 --> 16:15.915
They had him come in
for some of these same tests.

16:16.098 --> 16:17.568
He never came out.

16:19.534 --> 16:20.564
-But....
-But what?

16:20.735 --> 16:24.795
It's one of those things. cou|d've happen to
anybody? Doesn't mean it's gonna happen?

16:24.972 --> 16:26.872
I'm sorry. Harry.

16:27.542 --> 16:28.742
But you are a judge.

16:28.910 --> 16:31.970
You deal with other people's problems
every day.

16:32.313 --> 16:35.313
Now. can't you find it in yourself
to deal with your own?

16:35.483 --> 16:37.823
Well. intellectually.
that makes a lot of sense.

16:37.985 --> 16:41.315
But emotionally. I can't handle it.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.110
Take off your pants.

16:44.291 --> 16:46.061
KENNY:
What'd she say?

16:46.526 --> 16:48.046
-I'm getting out.
-No. you're not.

16:48.227 --> 16:50.487
-Billie. let go of me.
-I think I can take you.

16:50.663 --> 16:53.033
-Don't make me hurt you.
-You got no meat on you.

16:53.199 --> 16:54.559
You're a woman. be serious.

16:54.733 --> 16:59.003
-Get back in that bed.
-Okay. I warned you.

17:03.475 --> 17:05.635
All right. you stringy little magistrate.

17:05.809 --> 17:09.179
Now listen. you're hurting your friends
as well as yourself.

17:09.346 --> 17:11.175
-You know. I let you win.
-Just quiet.

17:12.249 --> 17:14.339
I'm not finished.

17:14.752 --> 17:17.021
You mean a lot to us. Harry.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.987
We all care about you.

17:21.090 --> 17:23.221
You mean a lot to me.

17:23.827 --> 17:25.017
I care.

17:26.597 --> 17:30.797
-I want a rematch when I'm healthy.
-Damn. don't you understand?

17:31.235 --> 17:33.995
I don't want you out of my life yet.

17:35.005 --> 17:36.595
You just got here.

17:38.273 --> 17:40.003
Billie.

17:40.841 --> 17:43.431
What you seem to be saying is....

17:43.610 --> 17:47.140
KENNY:
She wants to jump your bones. Harry.

17:55.655 --> 17:59.085
My God. I called that one. didn't I?

18:00.193 --> 18:02.693
Harry. I was--
Let me get that curtain for you.

18:02.862 --> 18:04.232
We were just talking.

18:04.396 --> 18:08.296
-I don't care what you have going on in--
HARRY: |'ve decided.

18:09.635 --> 18:11.225
I'm gonna have those tests.

18:11.402 --> 18:14.102
That's great news. I'll tell Bull.
He's down at pediatrics.

18:14.272 --> 18:17.072
The kids are riding him.

18:18.643 --> 18:21.273
You are gonna have the tests?

18:21.479 --> 18:22.879
Well. I suppose I should. huh?

18:23.915 --> 18:28.075
I mean. don't you wanna find out
how things turn out?

18:29.253 --> 18:30.553
Yeah. I do.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.240
KENNY:
Ditto.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.748
The walls have ears.

18:35.057 --> 18:37.787
KENNY:
I love the walls.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.835
-Mr. Beilin.
-Hello. Hello. doctor.

18:56.579 --> 18:59.709
-You're fit as a fiddle.
-Oh. no. Oh. no. no. no.

18:59.882 --> 19:03.082
Sir. we have run every test on you.
There's nothing wrong.

19:03.252 --> 19:04.452
I'm having a stroke.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.624
No. you're not. Mr. Beilin.

19:06.789 --> 19:11.319
Now. look. why don't you just get dressed.
pack up your things and go on home. okay?

19:15.397 --> 19:16.657
HARRY: So. doc?
-Mm-hm.

19:16.832 --> 19:19.272
-What's the good word?
-Surgery.

19:20.236 --> 19:22.466
That was a rhetorical question.

19:22.638 --> 19:24.498
-Well. minor surgery.
-Yeah?

19:24.673 --> 19:26.403
Yeah. we found something
on the x-ray.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.104
The sooner we pull it.
the better.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.912
-Pull what out?
-There it is. right there.

19:32.079 --> 19:34.009
-Tumor?
-Ulcer?

19:34.181 --> 19:35.651
-Whistle?
-We have a winner.

19:35.816 --> 19:37.646
-It's a whistle?
-Mm-hm.

19:37.818 --> 19:41.948
That's where it is.
I must've swallowed it.

19:42.356 --> 19:43.976
That would be my guess. yes.

19:44.591 --> 19:45.621
You know Zippy Bits?

19:45.792 --> 19:49.422
That breakfast cereal that promises
a free circus whistle in each box?

19:49.596 --> 19:52.566
Well. I bought a box. polished off
the whole thing. No whistle.

19:52.732 --> 19:57.142
I even called them. They said
there was a whistle in every box.

19:57.637 --> 20:00.267
-Guess they were right.
-You mean--

20:00.439 --> 20:05.169
You mean. he's been carrying a piece
of plastic in his stomach all these years?

20:05.344 --> 20:07.474
No. about three weeks.

20:08.748 --> 20:11.478
-What?
-Silly me. huh?

20:11.651 --> 20:13.851
-Ow.
-A whistle?

20:14.253 --> 20:17.623
I poured my guts out to you
over a whistle?

20:17.790 --> 20:20.090
Come on. you're supposed to like me.

20:20.258 --> 20:22.188
Come on. judge.
We'll get your whistle.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.260
Everyone's gonna
have to leave the room.

20:24.429 --> 20:26.919
Zippy Bits. huh?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.770
I opened myself up to him.

20:32.003 --> 20:33.533
Over Zippy Bits.

20:33.704 --> 20:38.804
I did it once for a piece of chocolate
and a pair of nylons.

20:42.913 --> 20:44.643
Get Operating Room 3 ready. okay?

20:44.814 --> 20:47.614
-Right. Hi.
-Hi.

20:47.784 --> 20:50.384
I got a day off tomorrow.

20:51.019 --> 20:52.949
I got a new watch.

-Good luck. sir.

20:56.557 --> 20:59.617
Thanks. See you. Selma.

21:08.469 --> 21:10.229
I want you to know...

21:11.539 --> 21:13.869
...I lied to you about
how I felt. Harry Stone.

21:14.742 --> 21:17.232
I just did it to get you
to take those tests.

21:18.446 --> 21:20.966
-I understand.
-You do?

21:21.148 --> 21:23.518
Probably would've done
the same for you.

21:23.684 --> 21:26.024
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

21:26.921 --> 21:31.951
So. what you're saying is you really don't
care all that much about me either. right?

21:32.126 --> 21:36.216
-I didn't say that. I care a lot about you.
-You do?

21:36.397 --> 21:39.087
I care a lot about people in general.

21:39.266 --> 21:42.326
I mean. isn't that what this
is all about. Billie? Caring?

Now. the way I see it....

22:00.053 --> 22:02.153
-Hi. Selma.
-Oh. how's Harry?

22:02.322 --> 22:05.052
Oh. he came through with flying colors.

He'll be up and around in a few days.

-Yeah.

22:08.360 --> 22:14.890

I never thought of it before.

Is this Judge Stone's room?

22:54.570 --> 22:57.630
Yeah. but he's gone.
