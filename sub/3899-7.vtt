01:16.973 --> 01:18.514
[inmate 1] You need a lot of this.

01:18.515 --> 01:21.267
The wrong place for that, my friend.

01:21.268 --> 01:22.928
[indistinct conversations]

01:23.354 --> 01:26.098
[sighs deeply]

01:35.366 --> 01:37.818
[inmate 2] Do you see my towel?

01:45.084 --> 01:47.828
- [inmate 3] I'm starving.
- [inmate 4] Yeah, me, too.

01:50.506 --> 01:52.041
[inmate 5] Hey, Norma.

01:54.135 --> 01:55.877
Morning, Norma.

01:56.888 --> 01:59.465
Hey, Norma, can I get
my morning blessing?

02:00.641 --> 02:02.843
You know, the little
arm squeeze thing you do?

02:05.771 --> 02:08.189
Yup, hits the spot.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.725
[chuckles]

02:12.153 --> 02:13.437
[inmate] Hey.

02:15.907 --> 02:17.032
[urinating]

02:17.033 --> 02:19.367
[inmate] Yo, Norma, I
know you got the magic.

02:19.368 --> 02:22.495
Banfield says she brushed
against you in the cafeteria,

02:22.496 --> 02:26.291
and when you touched her
wart, it fell off the next day!

02:26.292 --> 02:28.043
[toilet flushes]

02:28.044 --> 02:30.420
So, I got this letter I'm
sending to my guy, Rodney,

02:30.421 --> 02:33.039
and I'm a need you to hocus pocus it.

02:33.757 --> 02:36.592
You know, I hear he got
this new girlfriend, Leslie.

02:36.593 --> 02:39.554
Oh, and I don't need you to
hex her or nothing like that,

02:39.555 --> 02:41.973
'cause, you know, that
would be crazy. [chuckles]

02:41.974 --> 02:43.474
Or would it?

02:43.475 --> 02:47.638
I don't know. You know, It would be
great, actually, if you could hex Leslie.

02:55.029 --> 02:56.230
That's it?

03:00.826 --> 03:02.278
[gasps]

03:03.204 --> 03:06.532
Oh, I felt that. Seriously!

03:07.416 --> 03:10.376
Goosies on my arms! Look
at my arm hair! [gasps]

03:10.377 --> 03:13.504
Oh, that is some spooky
shit! Oh, thank you.

03:13.505 --> 03:17.376
Thank you so much! Spooky shit.

03:20.554 --> 03:23.882
Are you a good witch or a bad witch?

03:28.312 --> 03:30.063
[man on video] Two types
of sexual harassment

03:30.064 --> 03:31.814
are generally recognized.

03:31.815 --> 03:35.235
Quid Pro Quo and
Hostile Work Environment.

03:35.236 --> 03:37.988
Quid Pro Quo means,
"Something for something."

03:37.989 --> 03:41.074
For instance, a manager
promises to give you a promotion

03:41.075 --> 03:43.118
in exchange for some sexual favor.

03:43.119 --> 03:44.619
- [laughing]
- Hostile Work Environment.

03:44.620 --> 03:45.954
- This type...
- Question?

03:45.955 --> 03:47.705
- Hostile environment?
- [Tim] Yes.

03:47.706 --> 03:48.789
It's a prison.

03:48.790 --> 03:52.877
Uh, we are referring to a
co-worker's unwanted flirting,

03:52.878 --> 03:54.963
sexually suggestive looks,

03:54.964 --> 03:59.134
language, shoulder
massages, back scratching.

03:59.135 --> 04:04.347
Uh, any behavior that a reasonable
person would deem inappropriate.

04:04.348 --> 04:07.392
Using, um, offensive or degrading names,

04:07.393 --> 04:10.728
such as "honey, sweetie, baby..."

04:10.729 --> 04:12.105
- Daddy-mack.
- [Bayley chuckling]

04:12.106 --> 04:14.183
- [Ford] Cuddly-wuddly.
- [Kowalski] Sugar tits.

04:14.858 --> 04:16.776
Come on! How old are you?

04:16.777 --> 04:19.570
- Sorry, sir.
- No, really, how old are you?

04:19.571 --> 04:22.490
- Uh, 21, sir.
- Wow.

04:22.491 --> 04:25.201
Yeah, my birthday was
actually last Tuesday.

04:25.202 --> 04:28.163
- I had my first Amaretto sour.
- Good for you.

04:28.164 --> 04:30.123
Now, lose the junior
high school shenanigans

04:30.124 --> 04:31.541
and act like a fucking person.

04:31.542 --> 04:32.667
Yes, sir.

04:32.668 --> 04:35.586
And the rest of you, set
an example for the new COs

04:35.587 --> 04:38.790
and show some respect
to George over here.

04:39.466 --> 04:42.552
- [man on video] Sexual harassment...
- That's actually Tim from HR.

04:42.553 --> 04:44.304
But the majority of sexual harassment...

04:44.305 --> 04:46.639
- Who's George?
- George is PR.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.310
- Is PR the same as marketing?
- No, no, Debra's marketing.

04:50.311 --> 04:54.730
Welcome to the corporate maze.
[chuckles] Sorry for the rigmarole.

04:54.731 --> 04:58.026
It'd be nice if it also
covered inmate relations,

04:58.027 --> 04:59.860
being this is a female prison.

04:59.861 --> 05:00.986
Completely agree.

05:00.987 --> 05:05.366
But, uh, hey, anything to get folks
thinking about appropriate behavior.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.743
We've had some incidents in the past.

05:07.744 --> 05:11.164
Oh, you wouldn't believe some
of the cases we've had. Just...

05:11.165 --> 05:15.418
Employees sexting and porn
on their work computers,

05:15.419 --> 05:18.338
masturbating in the
office. Just disgusting.

05:18.339 --> 05:20.957
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, disgusting.

05:23.219 --> 05:26.387
[Flaca] Don't you think the
people buying these panties

05:26.388 --> 05:28.639
will feel weird if they knew
a bunch of felons made them?

05:28.640 --> 05:30.725
[Black Cindy] Mmm-mmm. They'd
probably think that shit was hot.

05:30.726 --> 05:33.686
Yeah, they should put that shit
on the tag, "Made in Federal."

05:33.687 --> 05:34.979
[all laughing]

05:34.980 --> 05:37.148
Dudes would be into polyester grannies

05:37.149 --> 05:40.610
if they knew they came from a
bunch of bisnotches behind bars.

05:40.611 --> 05:43.654
You know, when I was in Chicago, this
guy asked me for my dirty underwear.

05:43.655 --> 05:45.573
- To wear?
- To sniff.

05:45.574 --> 05:47.992
Oh. Yeah, that's a
thing. Panty sniffers.

05:47.993 --> 05:49.577
[Stella] In Tokyo, they
have vending machines.

05:49.578 --> 05:53.206
You can buy dirty schoolgirl panties
for, like, I don't know, 10,000 yen.

05:53.207 --> 05:55.625
- What that is in real money?
- It's like 80 bucks.

05:55.626 --> 05:56.993
Huh!

05:57.753 --> 06:00.463
One of my old boyfriends
was obsessed with noses.

06:00.464 --> 06:02.465
Always trying to suck on mine.

06:02.466 --> 06:05.218
It left a very confusing hickey.

06:05.219 --> 06:06.594
I can't believe that's a thing.

06:06.595 --> 06:08.471
Man, everything is a thing!

06:08.472 --> 06:10.973
Like them people who like
to fuck in animal costumes.

06:10.974 --> 06:12.057
[chuckles] Furries.

06:12.058 --> 06:14.227
Or those guys who are
really into My Little Pony.

06:14.228 --> 06:17.013
- Bronies.
- Look at you, Google.

06:17.606 --> 06:19.524
What are you, some
kind of fetish fangirl?

06:19.525 --> 06:21.984
[Black Cindy chuckling] See,
that's the thing with the Internet.

06:21.985 --> 06:23.819
Nobody's a freak no more.

06:23.820 --> 06:28.115
See, it used to be all these weirdoes
sitting alone in their houses,

06:28.116 --> 06:30.993
jerking it to bugs or falling
in love with their toasters,

06:30.994 --> 06:32.787
feeling all creepy and sad.

06:32.788 --> 06:35.498
Now, all they got to do is log on

06:35.499 --> 06:37.875
and find the same-minded
toaster-loving peeps

06:37.876 --> 06:41.754
and, like, bam, suddenly
shit be perfectly normal!

06:41.755 --> 06:46.176
Shawty, you could be into cannibalism
or like being tickled. It don't matter.

06:46.177 --> 06:49.011
Somebody out there
gonna like what you like.

06:49.012 --> 06:50.430
[sewing machine whirring]

06:50.431 --> 06:53.098
Damn! I sewed the leg shut again.

06:53.099 --> 06:54.593
- Shit!
- [inmates laughing]

06:55.311 --> 06:56.561
How do you even do that?

06:56.562 --> 06:58.271
Man, whatever. [clicks tongue]

06:58.272 --> 07:01.316
- This 'bout to be a headband. Yeah.
- [inmates laughing]

07:01.317 --> 07:03.018
Check it, check it.

07:03.860 --> 07:07.322
Inmate! That's official
Whispers merchandise.

07:07.323 --> 07:08.489
If you make any more mistakes,

07:08.490 --> 07:10.533
we're gonna take the full
retail price out of your pay.

07:10.534 --> 07:14.119
Ooh, what is that? Like 100 hours
of work for 25 cents of fabric?

07:14.120 --> 07:15.913
Zip it, Hayes, or that's a shot.

07:15.914 --> 07:17.332
This is not coffee hour,

07:17.333 --> 07:20.702
and there are plenty of bodies in here
who'd be happy to fill those seats!

07:35.141 --> 07:37.059
What am I supposed to do with you?

07:37.060 --> 07:38.728
You're the boss. You tell me.

07:38.729 --> 07:40.521
I don't know how you talked
your way back in here.

07:40.522 --> 07:43.566
You're like a Somali pirate
trying to get their ladder hooked.

07:43.567 --> 07:47.445
But I got the whole fucking
Coast Guard watching you.

07:47.446 --> 07:50.281
You see these girls? They're mine!

07:50.282 --> 07:51.532
Don't you try nothing.

07:51.533 --> 07:53.284
The evil eye goes both ways.

07:53.285 --> 07:55.286
I'm only happy to be back.

07:55.287 --> 07:57.580
You gonna be happy sweeping
the floor, washing dishes?

07:57.581 --> 07:59.624
Because there's no way I'm
gonna let you handle a knife.

07:59.625 --> 08:01.284
Probably wise.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.871
- Go help Norma.
- That peeler is pretty sharp, too.

08:06.840 --> 08:10.843
And no funny business, got
it? I am watching my back, Red.

08:10.844 --> 08:12.588
Yes, boss.

08:18.602 --> 08:20.144
All right, everybody, come on,

08:20.145 --> 08:21.896
I gotta get this shit
prepped before 10:00!

08:21.897 --> 08:24.064
10:00? First lunch
block isn't till 11:00.

08:24.065 --> 08:25.149
Well, Benny's coming.

08:25.150 --> 08:27.109
I'm not gonna make my kid
drive up here for two hours

08:27.110 --> 08:28.444
to sit with him for five minutes.

08:28.445 --> 08:29.820
He should come a different time.

08:29.821 --> 08:31.239
Hitchhikers can't be choosers.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.817
Sophia's wife can't drive
him later, and she's my ride.

08:40.957 --> 08:44.585
You know if you boil them first, you
could slide the skin off with your hands.

08:44.586 --> 08:45.787
I taught you that.

08:47.714 --> 08:49.583
Amateurs.

08:52.928 --> 08:55.680
Twelve years we've been
in this kitchen together.

08:55.681 --> 08:57.090
We're a good team, hmm?

09:00.894 --> 09:02.853
Thank you, Norma.

09:02.854 --> 09:05.056
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

09:24.585 --> 09:27.203
[sitar music playing]

09:31.592 --> 09:33.468
[Guru Mack] Well, I want
everything to be better.

09:33.469 --> 09:34.677
I want everything to be happier.

09:34.678 --> 09:36.721
And I keep doing the same
thing over and over again,

09:36.722 --> 09:38.556
which, to me, is the
definition of insanity.

09:38.557 --> 09:40.216
- [all laughing]
- Right?

09:41.393 --> 09:44.220
Welcome, sister. Have a seat.

09:44.813 --> 09:46.389
Join us.

09:48.775 --> 09:50.192
As I was saying,

09:50.193 --> 09:53.153
you're all here because you're
interested in transformation.

09:53.154 --> 09:56.866
And you're asking
yourself, "Do I feel happy?"

09:56.867 --> 09:58.033
[woman] Right on.

09:58.034 --> 09:59.660
[Guru Mack] "Do I feel good enough?

09:59.661 --> 10:01.371
Do I feel out of control?"

10:01.372 --> 10:03.080
[all murmuring assent]

10:03.081 --> 10:04.457
[Guru Mack] Lonely?

10:04.458 --> 10:08.503
Afraid? Why do I hate myself?

10:08.504 --> 10:09.670
[man] Choice words.

10:09.671 --> 10:13.132
[Guru Mack] Well, this
self that you speak of...

10:13.133 --> 10:14.800
it's not a fixed object.

10:14.801 --> 10:18.012
- It's a story that we're telling, right?
- Right on.

10:18.013 --> 10:21.932
And if you wanna change the
self, you gotta change the story.

10:21.933 --> 10:24.685
[laughs] Because the
desire to transform,

10:24.686 --> 10:28.648
the thing that brought you here today,
means you've already begun to change.

10:28.649 --> 10:30.149
- Right?
- Yeah.

10:30.150 --> 10:33.986
I'm not here to save you, children.
I'm just a bearded guy in white pants.

10:33.987 --> 10:35.821
[all laughing]

10:35.822 --> 10:39.950
They call me Guru Mack
because I'm a teacher.

10:39.951 --> 10:43.529
And I can teach you how
to change your story.

10:45.541 --> 10:49.035
Sister Sad Eyes, what
brings you to us today?

10:50.336 --> 10:53.665
Don't be shy, you're among friends.
Everybody here is a searcher.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.670
What is the story that you are telling?

11:00.889 --> 11:02.215
Mmm...

11:03.434 --> 11:05.267
[stuttering]

11:05.268 --> 11:06.845
My...

11:07.729 --> 11:09.855
[stuttering]

11:09.856 --> 11:12.308
Okay, okay, okay, I got it.

11:15.446 --> 11:16.821
[sighs]

11:16.822 --> 11:18.439
I feel your spirit.

11:19.407 --> 11:22.402
- [sighs]
- You don't ever have to speak with me.

11:25.413 --> 11:26.990
I hear you.

11:30.586 --> 11:31.836
[sighing]

11:31.837 --> 11:33.079
[breathes deeply]

11:34.214 --> 11:35.707
Stay with us.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.794
I'm glad you're here.

11:50.647 --> 11:51.981
I can't let you perform this in class.

11:51.982 --> 11:55.192
Oh, it's not a solo piece.
I'm gonna cast the other parts.

11:55.193 --> 11:57.027
Of course, I play Edwina.

11:57.028 --> 12:01.031
I know she has freckles and
a more... ample bosom than I,

12:01.032 --> 12:04.284
but I think we can use our imaginations.

12:04.285 --> 12:06.328
How do I put this constructively?

12:06.329 --> 12:10.500
Um, this piece of writing is...
obscene. It's pornographic.

12:10.501 --> 12:13.954
No, it's erotically inclined.

12:15.046 --> 12:17.373
"His purple love muscle?

12:18.049 --> 12:21.051
Her three holes opened, ready
to be explored by his..."

12:21.052 --> 12:22.386
[both reciting] "Swollen pangolin."

12:22.387 --> 12:23.846
I don't even know what a pangolin is.

12:23.847 --> 12:27.300
It's a mammal with scales.
And in this context, it's...

12:28.769 --> 12:32.388
Okay, yeah, I got it. This
was not the assignment.

12:33.314 --> 12:34.940
You asked us to use our imagination.

12:34.941 --> 12:38.569
I asked you to re-imagine
a primary life experience,

12:38.570 --> 12:41.155
not write a kinky sex
fantasy set in space.

12:41.156 --> 12:45.284
It's not just sex, it's love.

12:45.285 --> 12:48.453
It's two people connecting...

12:48.454 --> 12:51.541
with four other people, and aliens.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.584
- Suzanne, no.
- But it's just...

12:53.585 --> 12:56.329
It's inappropriate
and I can't support it.

12:57.088 --> 12:59.040
That's final.

13:03.344 --> 13:05.179
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

13:05.180 --> 13:08.098
Stupid! I'm stupid.

13:08.099 --> 13:11.268
She said it's dirty and
it's wrong, and she hated it!

13:11.269 --> 13:13.353
- Hated what?
- [exclaims]

13:13.354 --> 13:16.440
Your story? And you've
been working so hard, too.

13:16.441 --> 13:18.226
Yeah.

13:19.444 --> 13:23.106
Come on, now. 'Cause one
person doesn't like it?

13:26.159 --> 13:29.912
You know, Stephen King got
rejected a bazillion times

13:29.913 --> 13:31.789
before anybody looked at his shit!

13:31.790 --> 13:33.498
Fucking J.K. Rowling!

13:33.499 --> 13:36.376
Some punk-ass publisher
read Harry fucking Potter

13:36.377 --> 13:38.496
and was like... "Nope."

13:39.214 --> 13:42.592
Now, I haven't read this yet,

13:42.593 --> 13:48.013
but knowing that wacky brain of yours,
I'm sure it's got to be mad interesting.

13:48.014 --> 13:50.341
She said it was vulgar.

13:53.019 --> 13:57.189
Okay, you really did, um... go there.

13:57.190 --> 14:01.861
Look, Berdie is just trying to
protect her stupid-ass class.

14:01.862 --> 14:04.029
Chang got to do her scene,

14:04.030 --> 14:07.491
and it's all heads chopping
off and organs coming out.

14:07.492 --> 14:09.660
That's because this is America.

14:09.661 --> 14:13.914
Violence is all good and fine,
but sex? [gasps] Lord, no!

14:13.915 --> 14:15.457
Okay?

14:15.458 --> 14:20.121
Don't let her stop you,
Suzanne. You got to keep writing.

14:21.715 --> 14:24.258
- So, there's these different categories.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:24.259 --> 14:27.302
Who you're gonna marry,
what car you're gonna drive,

14:27.303 --> 14:29.138
and how many kids you're gonna have.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.849
Are you telling me you've
never played MASH before?

14:31.850 --> 14:33.100
Not since I was 12.

14:33.101 --> 14:36.596
I remember that. MASH.
Tells your future, right?

14:37.563 --> 14:39.690
Mansion, Apartment...

14:39.691 --> 14:42.484
- Shack, House. Yes! [laughs]
- Yeah.

14:42.485 --> 14:44.361
You draw your spiral...

14:44.362 --> 14:46.071
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...and then you count your lines,

14:46.072 --> 14:47.907
and you get your magic number.

14:47.908 --> 14:50.034
And there it is, your whole life!

14:50.035 --> 14:52.202
Ah. [chuckling] Yeah.

14:52.203 --> 14:54.197
I always ended up living in the shack.

14:56.917 --> 14:59.669
Chapman probably lived in a mansion.

14:59.670 --> 15:02.337
- In the game or in real life?
- In real life.

15:02.338 --> 15:04.464
Oh, no. It was hardly a mansion.

15:04.465 --> 15:06.167
How many bathrooms?

15:07.052 --> 15:13.424
Um, four? Or five. There was
a half-bath off the playroom.

15:14.517 --> 15:16.219
The playroom?

15:17.938 --> 15:20.556
It was a good-sized house.

15:21.524 --> 15:22.808
Mansion.

15:23.484 --> 15:25.854
- Did you have a maid?
- No!

15:27.072 --> 15:28.439
Housekeeper.

15:30.158 --> 15:32.451
- [chuckling]
- I was very lonely as a child.

15:32.452 --> 15:33.819
[sucks teeth]

15:38.583 --> 15:43.121
Do you hear yourself
sometimes? Like, when you speak?

15:44.673 --> 15:46.048
[Black Cindy] Mmm!

15:46.049 --> 15:49.927
Fuck, yeah! Hey, y'all, tell me
these kosher meals ain't delicious!

15:49.928 --> 15:54.098
- This broccoli still got crunch.
- Yo, y'all gotta keep your voices down.

15:54.099 --> 15:57.059
Y'all get the noodles?
Yo, mine had noodles!

15:57.060 --> 15:59.478
Mmm-mmm-mmm!

15:59.479 --> 16:02.982
- Would y'all shut the hell up?
- Yo, why you shushing me?

16:02.983 --> 16:05.943
You keep running your mouth,
everyone's gonna start asking!

16:05.944 --> 16:07.069
So?

16:07.070 --> 16:09.571
Then they're gonna find out
none of us are actually Jewish,

16:09.572 --> 16:11.073
and none of us gonna get 'em!

16:11.074 --> 16:13.075
- How do they know I ain't Jewish?
- Shh.

16:13.076 --> 16:15.911
Man, how come Jews only get
to eat this deliciousness?

16:15.912 --> 16:17.079
Shh!

16:17.080 --> 16:18.364
Now stop shushing me!

16:19.415 --> 16:23.043
That's a eye shush. And a eye shush
just as bad as a regular shush!

16:23.044 --> 16:27.214
One, two, three, four, five. Yes!

16:27.215 --> 16:28.382
So, you're gonna marry Gustav.

16:28.383 --> 16:31.135
And you're gonna be living
in an apartment in Maui.

16:31.136 --> 16:32.302
[squealing]

16:32.303 --> 16:36.056
With 13 kids!

16:36.057 --> 16:38.517
And you're gonna be driving...
you know, a Toyota Corolla.

16:38.518 --> 16:39.719
Great.

16:40.186 --> 16:43.022
Gustav. Is that the Romanian?

16:43.023 --> 16:45.315
- Yes, he's... He's very nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:45.316 --> 16:49.653
He's not the world's greatest speller,
but English is not his first language.

16:49.654 --> 16:52.531
Thirteen kids in an apartment,
that is gonna be tight.

16:52.532 --> 16:57.112
Well, you're gonna be living in Maui,
spending most of your time outside.

16:57.829 --> 17:01.415
I thought I was gonna marry
Ralph, but he's so into firearms.

17:01.416 --> 17:04.334
I guess that could be dangerous
with all the little ones around.

17:04.335 --> 17:05.544
- [Piper] Right?
- [Big Boo] Mmm.

17:05.545 --> 17:06.837
Ralph's the fatty?

17:06.838 --> 17:11.215
No, no. The fatty is
into Japanese cartoons.

17:11.217 --> 17:13.510
He has these dreamy eyes.

17:13.511 --> 17:15.630
You find the good in everyone.

17:16.222 --> 17:18.766
- It's a lovely quality.
- Lovely?

17:18.767 --> 17:21.101
She's scamming creeps
for commissary money.

17:21.102 --> 17:23.395
I mean, that is what
you're doing, isn't it?

17:23.396 --> 17:28.525
They are lonely. They just
need somebody to listen to them.

17:28.526 --> 17:30.610
And it's not like I got
something better to do.

17:30.611 --> 17:32.237
[Piper] I think that women's prison

17:32.238 --> 17:35.324
feeds into the whole '70s
exploitation fantasy for men.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.410
It's like we're all in Chained
Heat or Cellblock Sisters

17:38.411 --> 17:41.163
and all we do is have
lesbian sex and strip searches

17:41.164 --> 17:43.824
and naked cat fights in the shower.

17:49.047 --> 17:50.505
We also do other things.

17:50.506 --> 17:52.341
[chuckles]

17:52.342 --> 17:53.884
Who cares if it's a fantasy?

17:53.885 --> 17:57.346
They get what they want,
I get to make a buck.

17:57.347 --> 17:59.382
Everybody wins!

18:15.115 --> 18:16.698
What are those?

18:16.699 --> 18:20.660
They were gonna be a gift
for you, but I have an idea.

18:20.661 --> 18:23.998
Bear with me because it's,
uh... it sounds kind of crazy.

18:23.999 --> 18:25.707
Shoot.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.418
You may think that I
stole these from Whispers,

18:28.419 --> 18:32.797
but... technically... I didn't,

18:32.798 --> 18:35.217
because I made them from material
they were just gonna throw away.

18:35.218 --> 18:40.256
So, I re-purposed trash and there's...
there's no official crime happening here.

18:40.765 --> 18:42.592
You are such a good girl.

18:44.936 --> 18:48.063
These are the second pair
I've made with no one noticing.

18:48.064 --> 18:52.651
If I could get some people helping me,
I could have a pretty healthy supply.

18:52.652 --> 18:54.278
And rumor has it,

18:54.279 --> 18:57.406
there are guys out there that
like sniffing dirty underwear.

18:57.407 --> 18:59.491
And I think that they
would be extra interested

18:59.492 --> 19:02.619
if they came from lady felons.

19:02.620 --> 19:07.666
We are sitting on... a gold mine!

19:07.667 --> 19:10.585
We have captive women
and we have underwear!

19:10.586 --> 19:14.798
All we need to do is recruit a bunch
of girls with super stinky tutus

19:14.799 --> 19:16.466
and then figure out a
way to get the used goods

19:16.467 --> 19:19.379
out there to the... freaks who want 'em.

19:22.057 --> 19:26.177
No! It sounds nuts, doesn't it?

19:27.312 --> 19:30.556
- It made sense in my head.
- Are you kidding?

19:31.066 --> 19:32.267
What?

19:33.193 --> 19:34.859
This is fucking brilliant.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.312
[laughing]

19:38.323 --> 19:41.116
This is your duty belt.
It contains a walkie...

19:41.117 --> 19:43.243
- [Bayley] He said "duty."
- ...cuffs, expandable baton,

19:43.244 --> 19:46.163
sterile gloves, and pepper spray.

19:46.164 --> 19:47.331
Nice!

19:47.332 --> 19:50.334
These are not toys.
They are a last resort.

19:50.335 --> 19:54.171
If an inmate is not responding
to a reasonable command

19:54.172 --> 19:55.464
and needs to be subdued,

19:55.465 --> 19:59.084
I will demonstrate the
proper subjugation technique.

20:00.136 --> 20:02.304
CO Rikerson, if you please.

20:02.305 --> 20:07.892
The goal is to use your opponent's
own weight and inertia against her.

20:07.893 --> 20:12.106
Now, let us imagine this
is a diminutive lady inmate

20:12.107 --> 20:15.275
and not Dont'a Hightower over here.

20:15.276 --> 20:18.028
[Caputo laughing] You don't
want to hurt me, buddy, huh?

20:18.029 --> 20:21.406
I will use a combination
joint-locking technique

20:21.407 --> 20:23.818
to take my opponent to the ground.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.579
The inmate is angry.

20:27.580 --> 20:30.700
Maybe she goes to grab
me, or push me. Please.

20:32.377 --> 20:35.670
Trap her hand against my
chest with my right hand.

20:35.671 --> 20:37.589
- Turn the wrist...
- [Rikerson groaning]

20:37.590 --> 20:41.426
...apply an arm bar with my
left hand just above the elbow.

20:41.427 --> 20:43.220
And as I pivot,

20:43.221 --> 20:46.507
- easily taking my attacker to the ground.
- [Rikerson] Ow, ow, ow.

20:47.892 --> 20:49.393
[Rikerson groaning]

20:49.394 --> 20:52.187
God, that hurt. That really hurt!

20:52.188 --> 20:53.855
- Sorry.
- Shit, man!

20:53.856 --> 20:56.400
I need my inhaler. Where's my inhaler?

20:56.401 --> 20:58.068
[Caputo] Okay, as you can see,

20:58.069 --> 21:01.738
I have, uh, effectively
neutralized the prisoner.

21:01.739 --> 21:05.200
Great, great. Well done,
Jackie Chan. Thank you for that.

21:05.201 --> 21:09.788
You guys should read through those manuals
and keep practicing this karate business.

21:09.789 --> 21:12.166
It seems very effective.

21:12.167 --> 21:13.250
We're not done.

21:13.251 --> 21:15.335
Can I speak with you for a minute?

21:15.336 --> 21:19.006
Okay. Practice with your partners.

21:19.007 --> 21:22.009
CO Donaldson, take over.

21:22.010 --> 21:23.802
All right, COs, line
up with your inmates.

21:23.803 --> 21:25.012
- Let's get started.
- [officer] Okay.

21:25.013 --> 21:26.596
Half speed, no takedowns.

21:26.597 --> 21:29.183
But when you feel comfortable,
take it to the ground.

21:29.184 --> 21:33.895
All right... "Sicko-witch."
Give me your best shot.

21:33.896 --> 21:37.933
- It's Sikowitz. Like "psycho."
- Well, we'll see about that.

21:38.318 --> 21:39.484
[Sikowitz yelps]

21:39.485 --> 21:43.530
- I'm not afraid of you, Donuts.
- Stop calling me that.

21:43.531 --> 21:45.282
I know you bribed your way
in here. What'd it take?

21:45.283 --> 21:47.083
Half a dozen jellies and a cruller, huh?

21:49.079 --> 21:51.955
Hey, Joe, we're not
paying these guys do PE.

21:51.956 --> 21:53.748
They need 40 hours of training.

21:53.749 --> 21:56.460
We need to be able to assess
their physical efficiency,

21:56.461 --> 21:58.212
teach them how to convey an order.

21:58.213 --> 22:01.423
That sounds like...
on-the-job stuff to me.

22:01.424 --> 22:04.801
I can't send a bunch of
untrained COs out there.

22:04.802 --> 22:06.053
You're not.

22:06.054 --> 22:08.680
You're partnering them
with experienced guards

22:08.681 --> 22:10.591
and calling it an apprenticeship.

22:11.559 --> 22:13.602
There is an art to this.

22:13.603 --> 22:16.020
Proper levels of assertion,

22:16.021 --> 22:20.609
how to communicate
verbally and non-verbally.

22:20.610 --> 22:23.103
That's why we have the manual.

22:23.904 --> 22:25.898
They are not gonna read that.

22:27.325 --> 22:28.617
Yes, really.

22:28.618 --> 22:32.621
See what I did there?
Communicated with you non-verbally.

22:32.622 --> 22:36.075
No training here. Let's get 'em working.

22:38.378 --> 22:40.287
Motherfucker!

22:43.174 --> 22:46.551
Ay, tonta, your mother never taught
you how to reheat dinner rolls?

22:46.552 --> 22:50.722
My mother taught me to pluck my eyebrows
and to duct-tape my tits together.

22:50.723 --> 22:53.433
[chuckling] Mira, I told
you that you needed to

22:53.434 --> 22:55.560
- clean these steamers between every meal.
- [Aleida sighs]

22:55.561 --> 22:57.771
- That's some nasty shit.
- You know what's nasty?

22:57.772 --> 22:59.439
The cabbage that's been
in there for two days.

22:59.440 --> 23:02.192
You are a pain in my
ass, the both of you.

23:02.193 --> 23:05.069
- If you fill them with warm, soapy...
- No, no, no chiming in.

23:05.070 --> 23:07.197
What, you think I don't
know how to run my kitchen?

23:07.198 --> 23:10.367
All right, Maria, you're in
charge while I take my visitation.

23:10.368 --> 23:11.701
You gonna leave me
here with these clowns?

23:11.702 --> 23:14.279
Try not to fuck it all up, huh?

23:18.584 --> 23:19.668
[Red] Aw.

23:19.669 --> 23:22.212
It's good to see you back in here, Gina.

23:22.213 --> 23:24.256
Hey, Red, we've come
to see Norma, actually.

23:24.257 --> 23:27.676
A bunch of us were wondering if
you would meet with us in a group.

23:27.677 --> 23:29.803
[Gina] My Wiccan
circle is getting weird.

23:29.804 --> 23:32.597
Protchnick keeps rubbing the
energy ball on her cooter,

23:32.598 --> 23:35.058
and who wants to touch it
after that? You know, so...

23:35.059 --> 23:38.478
I think we would all benefit
from some energetic time with you.

23:38.479 --> 23:40.146
What are you babbling about?

23:40.147 --> 23:43.358
Norma's a healer. She has powers.

23:43.359 --> 23:44.609
You believe this?

23:44.610 --> 23:47.904
She's performing miracles, Red.
Everyone's talking about it.

23:47.905 --> 23:51.325
We booked some time in the chapel,
and we were hoping to meet tomorrow.

23:51.326 --> 23:54.453
Chapel? What is she, your priest?

23:54.454 --> 23:58.207
The poor woman doesn't speak, so she
can't tell you to fuck off, but I can.

23:58.208 --> 24:01.084
She doesn't want to listen to
all your snively little problems.

24:01.085 --> 24:02.294
Do you, Norma?

24:02.295 --> 24:05.214
Be careful. She can hex you!

24:05.215 --> 24:08.883
[laughs] You think she's
some kind of magical mute?

24:08.884 --> 24:11.094
There's no way she's
comfortable with this.

24:11.095 --> 24:14.138
Are you, Norma? Go, get out of here.

24:14.139 --> 24:15.307
Gina, you know better.

24:15.308 --> 24:18.052
- Stop listening to this basket case. Shoo!
- We're gonna talk.

24:19.061 --> 24:22.731
[sighs] Are they
hounding you all the time?

24:22.732 --> 24:25.650
These women are desperate
for anything to believe in.

24:25.651 --> 24:29.363
Looking to you to guide them when
you can't even guide yourself.

24:29.364 --> 24:32.657
Norma, put the drink in
first and then the sandwich.

24:32.658 --> 24:34.318
You're squishing all of them!

24:35.077 --> 24:38.489
There you go. Better.

24:40.916 --> 24:42.993
[woman playing flute]

24:47.882 --> 24:50.375
[all chanting in Sanskrit]

24:57.433 --> 25:00.018
[all] Guru Mack is our teacher.

25:00.019 --> 25:02.479
Our teacher is our father.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.356
Our father is our God.

25:04.357 --> 25:06.441
Our God is our light,

25:06.442 --> 25:10.445
the sky, the sun, the heart.

25:10.446 --> 25:14.283
My children, today we open our hearts

25:14.284 --> 25:17.236
to this woman, Norma Moon...

25:17.995 --> 25:23.493
as I join her in marriage, with
body, with speech and with mind.

25:24.794 --> 25:28.380
Norma Moon, on this blessed day,

25:28.381 --> 25:33.919
I take you as my wife,
my partner, and my light.

25:34.970 --> 25:40.510
I join my heart to your heart,
and my soul to your soul,

25:41.101 --> 25:43.478
and my flesh to your flesh.

25:43.479 --> 25:46.981
And I vow to honor you in this life

25:46.982 --> 25:49.901
and on many astral planes to come.

25:49.902 --> 25:51.228
I am yours.

26:10.214 --> 26:14.593
Kirsa Rain, on this blessed
day, I take you as my wife,

26:14.594 --> 26:17.630
my partner and my light.

26:18.431 --> 26:24.136
And I join my heart to your
heart, my soul to your soul...

26:25.270 --> 26:27.514
and my flesh to your flesh.

26:41.245 --> 26:44.414
Silver Tree, on this blessed day,

26:44.415 --> 26:46.500
- I take you as my wife...
- This is getting weird.

26:46.501 --> 26:49.127
I never should have signed
over the pink slip to my Volvo.

26:49.128 --> 26:52.839
And I join my heart to your
heart, my soul to your soul,

26:52.840 --> 26:55.793
and my flesh to your flesh.

27:08.313 --> 27:09.564
Keep an eye out for contact.

27:09.565 --> 27:13.359
Obviously, if they're playing basketball,
gonna be some hands and shoulders.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.070
But any intimacy, call it off.

27:16.071 --> 27:18.407
- Like, "No touching"?
- Right.

27:18.408 --> 27:20.534
And don't ever let them
suck you into an argument.

27:20.535 --> 27:21.701
Don't get emotional.

27:21.702 --> 27:26.164
One of my training sergeants told
me, "If it feels good, don't say it."

27:26.165 --> 27:27.957
De-escalate the situation.

27:27.958 --> 27:29.333
- De-escalate. Got it.
- Right.

27:29.334 --> 27:30.835
- Okay?
- Yeah.

27:30.836 --> 27:32.879
All right. Keep an eye on
this Uno game over here,

27:32.880 --> 27:34.749
make sure they're not gambling.

27:38.761 --> 27:42.013
So, they'll have six,
uh, extra pair. Whoa.

27:42.014 --> 27:44.008
[stammering] Hey, Lolly!

27:46.436 --> 27:47.602
I know you?

27:47.603 --> 27:50.430
Yeah. Chicago?

27:52.357 --> 27:53.558
Um...

27:54.109 --> 27:55.394
Sorry.

27:56.195 --> 27:57.904
Wow.

27:57.905 --> 27:59.906
That is weird.

27:59.907 --> 28:04.953
You know, she didn't have glasses before,
so, maybe she was blind in Chicago?

28:04.954 --> 28:09.583
Oh, that thing happened in the yard.
I wonder if she's still mad at me.

28:09.584 --> 28:13.462
Wait, she was with us in
Chicago? What is she doing here?

28:13.463 --> 28:16.874
Well, anyway. Okay, how
many girls do we need?

28:17.967 --> 28:20.009
Only a few to start. We don't
know if we have any customers.

28:20.010 --> 28:22.762
And how many days do you think
it's gonna take to get 'em, uh...

28:22.763 --> 28:24.131
pungent?

28:25.099 --> 28:26.349
- Three.
- Okay.

28:26.350 --> 28:30.269
Ah, that seems like a lot. If
it's you? I don't know, two?

28:30.270 --> 28:32.897
- What, why?
- You have a strong brew.

28:32.898 --> 28:34.023
Oh.

28:34.024 --> 28:35.399
That's not a bad thing.

28:35.400 --> 28:37.777
Some people just have
more... presence than others.

28:37.778 --> 28:39.654
Are you gonna be wearing them?

28:39.655 --> 28:41.490
- Me? No!
- Okay.

28:41.491 --> 28:45.076
Can't deal with the thought of
dudes inhaling my dried excretions.

28:45.077 --> 28:46.828
No, I will stick to being the brains...

28:46.829 --> 28:48.121
- not the bajingo.
- All right.

28:48.122 --> 28:50.331
Okay, we need a mule to
carry them out of here.

28:50.332 --> 28:51.791
Yes, panty mule.

28:51.792 --> 28:53.918
Someone gullible,

28:53.919 --> 28:58.047
and insecure enough to be
flattered that you picked them.

28:58.048 --> 29:01.300
For the record, I was not
gullible, I was trusting.

29:01.301 --> 29:04.303
And perhaps a little... inhibited.

29:04.304 --> 29:05.756
You had a flimsy sense of self.

29:06.474 --> 29:08.394
You dressed head to
toe in Urban Outfitters.

29:09.727 --> 29:11.853
There's gotta be a joker in this bunch

29:11.854 --> 29:14.898
who needs a few extra
bucks and some warm fuzzies.

29:14.899 --> 29:16.183
[Piper] Hmm.

29:19.069 --> 29:21.655
- That's the one.
- Where?

29:21.656 --> 29:23.615
- Bet he doesn't even shave yet.
- That guy?

29:23.616 --> 29:24.908
He's like a Gerber baby.

29:24.909 --> 29:26.576
[Piper] What makes you
think that we can trust him?

29:26.577 --> 29:28.578
Believe me, that kid is a bug.

29:28.579 --> 29:31.748
He'll piss off the other COs soon enough.
And then he'll be looking for friends.

29:31.749 --> 29:33.374
[Piper] So, you tell me
how this is gonna work.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.377
"Hi, Gerber, how do you feel
about marching past security

29:36.378 --> 29:38.880
with a bunch of dirty panties
shoved down your pants?"

29:38.881 --> 29:44.302
See, this is why I will handle this
part. Because you have no nuance.

29:44.303 --> 29:47.764
Oh, yeah. Got you now.
Bam! Uno, motherfucker!

29:47.765 --> 29:51.935
You cheating bitch! Those ain't the
rules! You draw two and lose a turn.

29:51.936 --> 29:53.477
What you saying, I don't know Uno?

29:53.478 --> 29:57.231
I'm saying you sitting on cards
and you're a dumb, cheating bitch!

29:57.232 --> 29:58.942
- Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, freeze!

29:58.943 --> 30:01.069
- [both screaming]
- [Donaldson] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:01.070 --> 30:04.481
- [Donaldson] Ahh!
- [Bayley coughing and screaming]

30:05.783 --> 30:08.986
- [gasping and screaming]
- [alarm blaring]

30:09.453 --> 30:10.579
[Piper] Whoa!

30:10.580 --> 30:11.788
[screaming continues]

30:11.789 --> 30:14.916
Oh, my God. He's fucking insane!

30:14.917 --> 30:16.701
He's perfect.

30:17.461 --> 30:19.838
- This is unreadable!
- What is it?

30:19.839 --> 30:23.216
Suzanne's erotica. It's
worse than Fifty Shades!

30:23.217 --> 30:25.927
Not possible. How many times
she use the word, "Jeez"?

30:25.928 --> 30:27.428
It's fucking gross.

30:27.429 --> 30:30.640
She's got a sentence that
goes on a whole paragraph

30:30.641 --> 30:34.553
about some lady's clit that
turns into a caterpillar!

30:35.104 --> 30:36.312
Mmm.

30:36.313 --> 30:40.017
Finished. Two new chapters!

30:40.693 --> 30:43.820
I eagerly await your
thoughts, Madam Editor.

30:43.821 --> 30:46.065
Peruse at your leisure.

30:46.907 --> 30:49.033
I ain't perusing shit.

30:49.034 --> 30:52.071
Well, shit, let me see it.

30:54.123 --> 30:56.540
Well, you can't blame her for
wanting to escape, all right?

30:56.541 --> 30:57.834
It's lonely as fuck in here.

30:57.835 --> 31:03.958
"The Admiral thrust his pork
sword into her squish mitten"?

31:04.967 --> 31:06.300
Oh, shit!

31:06.301 --> 31:08.094
[laughing] Mmm!

31:08.095 --> 31:09.512
What the fuck was that?

31:09.513 --> 31:13.933
You assess the situation and you respond
with the appropriate level of force!

31:13.934 --> 31:17.020
And you never, ever,
ever discharge your weapon

31:17.021 --> 31:19.397
unless it's absolutely necessary!

31:19.398 --> 31:22.483
And if you do, and that weapon
happens to be pepper spray,

31:22.484 --> 31:25.562
you better damn well
make sure you're upwind!

31:26.280 --> 31:30.324
You are a trigger-happy knucklehead
who just got out of diapers.

31:30.325 --> 31:32.326
But you, how could you let this happen?

31:32.327 --> 31:34.663
Sir, with all due
respect, I'm not a nanny.

31:34.664 --> 31:38.499
No! You are an officer with
20 plus years' experience,

31:38.500 --> 31:42.754
and your job was to impart some
wisdom on fucking Baby Huey over here!

31:42.755 --> 31:45.799
Well, this is what happens when you
put untrained officers in gen pop.

31:45.800 --> 31:49.128
You don't think I know
that? I fucking know that!

31:51.596 --> 31:54.015
- Bayley, I should be firing your ass.
- I know.

31:54.016 --> 31:58.102
But it's your first day, so I'm gonna
chalk this up to mental retardation.

31:58.103 --> 32:03.274
If you so much as look at an inmate wrong
in the next week, you're out of here!

32:03.275 --> 32:06.444
Take the stupid fucking
nametag off. Now go!

32:06.445 --> 32:09.857
Get your asses down to
medical, and get an eyewash.

32:10.407 --> 32:12.951
And read the stupid fucking manuals!

32:12.952 --> 32:14.577
I hate fractions.

32:14.578 --> 32:16.204
- I ain't never gonna use it.
- Oh, yeah?

32:16.205 --> 32:18.707
What about when the recipe
calls for you to double it,

32:18.708 --> 32:21.375
and you gotta add a cup and a quarter?

32:21.376 --> 32:23.753
You're gonna have to know how to
add those two quarters together.

32:23.754 --> 32:25.497
When I'm a prison cook?

32:27.842 --> 32:30.468
All right, let's do number five.

32:30.469 --> 32:34.055
"In Debra's class, three-eighths
of the students have brown hair.

32:34.056 --> 32:37.350
Of the students with brown
hair, half have brown eyes.

32:37.351 --> 32:39.310
What fraction of the
students in Debra's class

32:39.311 --> 32:42.105
have both brown hair and brown eyes?"

32:42.106 --> 32:45.108
Fuck Debra. Right in her brown eye.

32:45.109 --> 32:48.236
Baby, come on, you gotta graduate.

32:48.237 --> 32:50.321
This is fifth-grader math!

32:50.322 --> 32:52.949
I mean, I don't
understand it either, okay?

32:52.950 --> 32:58.705
But... we can figure this out.
All you gotta do is get a C.

32:58.706 --> 32:59.873
Psst!

32:59.874 --> 33:03.501
- Yo, Mike, you want a bag?
- Nah, man, she's not that ugly.

33:03.502 --> 33:05.204
[both laughing]

33:07.047 --> 33:08.415
What does that mean, a bag?

33:09.759 --> 33:13.462
- You selling weed again?
- No, it's part of a joke.

33:14.388 --> 33:17.382
- What joke?
- You wouldn't get it.

33:20.435 --> 33:21.560
So, you guys really getting along, huh?

33:21.561 --> 33:24.397
Oh, yeah, they've been
giggling for the last two hours.

33:24.398 --> 33:26.900
He's fucking hilarious. [laughs]

33:26.901 --> 33:28.317
Hey! Language.

33:28.318 --> 33:30.486
Benny said "fuck" in the
car, like, four times.

33:30.487 --> 33:32.655
- You didn't say anything.
- Benny doesn't live in our house.

33:32.656 --> 33:34.741
- This is censorship.
- Michael.

33:34.742 --> 33:36.868
Fuck that, I'm not a fucking baby.

33:36.869 --> 33:39.788
Knock it off! Does he talk
like this around the pastor?

33:39.789 --> 33:42.749
No, this just started.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.334
Well, cut it out. I'm serious.

33:45.335 --> 33:46.961
Fuckity fuck, fuck, fuck.

33:46.962 --> 33:49.047
[Benny laughing]

33:49.048 --> 33:51.590
Mendoza, they need you
back in the kitchen.

33:51.591 --> 33:52.675
I'm with my son.

33:52.676 --> 33:54.969
It's an emergency.
Ramos cut her finger off.

33:54.970 --> 33:57.806
What? Well, tell them to handle it.

33:57.807 --> 34:00.349
Are you in charge of
the kitchen? Let's go.

34:00.350 --> 34:02.761
Your kid can wait in the lobby.

34:04.479 --> 34:06.272
[sighs]

34:06.273 --> 34:07.682
[whispers] Sorry, baby.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.018
Whatever.

34:17.242 --> 34:19.327
- Neri wants a baby.
- Mmm.

34:19.328 --> 34:20.536
One day she's ranting about

34:20.536 --> 34:23.081
how irresponsible it is to put
more people on the planet, and now,

34:23.081 --> 34:27.418
suddenly, she's clocking her
ovulation and welding a nursery mobile

34:27.418 --> 34:30.295
that frankly, between you and me,
looks very sharp and dangerous.

34:30.297 --> 34:34.001
Well, maybe you guys should go for
it. I think you'd be great parents!

34:35.135 --> 34:39.505
You would be... [chuckles]
memorable parents.

34:41.225 --> 34:43.476
I gotta get my shit together, Pipes.

34:43.476 --> 34:46.938
We're still living with Carol and Bill
and the layers of taupe are getting to me.

34:46.938 --> 34:50.565
And suddenly, everyone and their
mother's got a job. Even Bloomer.

34:50.567 --> 34:51.943
Now that Polly's
whipping him into shape...

34:51.944 --> 34:53.895
No, no, no. No. Stop! No Larry.

34:54.989 --> 34:56.780
- He has a job? As what?
- Mmm.

34:56.781 --> 35:00.159
He's a regional editor for Zagat.
He's got an office and everything.

35:00.160 --> 35:01.736
Really?

35:02.496 --> 35:07.076
Look, all I'm saying is times are
a-changing, and I need to work.

35:09.336 --> 35:10.704
I have work for you!

35:12.464 --> 35:13.589
Really?

35:13.590 --> 35:14.798
Could you build me a website?

35:14.799 --> 35:17.676
It could be something very simple,
like a WordPress template or something.

35:17.677 --> 35:20.437
Why do you need a website? No one
even follows your blog anymore.

35:21.598 --> 35:23.766
I'm starting a used panty business.

35:23.767 --> 35:25.935
There are people

35:25.936 --> 35:29.522
[whispering] who like
to sniff dirty underwear.

35:29.523 --> 35:32.025
Oh, I know.

35:32.026 --> 35:35.069
There's a lot of sites. You've
got yourself some competition.

35:35.070 --> 35:37.488
Really? Well, then,
how much do they go for?

35:37.489 --> 35:38.781
Like, 25 bucks a pop.

35:38.782 --> 35:41.200
But the longer the wear,
the more you can tack on.

35:41.201 --> 35:44.162
And there's like a lot
of special categories,

35:44.163 --> 35:46.873
like "worn to the gym," or
"masturbated in," "peed in."

35:46.874 --> 35:47.957
What about "been to prison"?

35:47.958 --> 35:50.198
Oh, yeah, you could definitely
charge more for that.

35:50.878 --> 35:52.753
Pregnant ladies are a big thing, too.

35:52.754 --> 35:54.130
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:54.131 --> 35:57.341
I think it's because... maybe
they... they smell different.

35:57.342 --> 36:02.096
You know, Neri smells different and
she's just talking about getting pregnant.

36:02.097 --> 36:05.766
Wait, are you really gonna start a whole
criminal enterprise from behind bars?

36:05.767 --> 36:07.594
No, it's not drugs. It's underwear.

36:08.645 --> 36:10.097
I like your spirit.

36:12.066 --> 36:14.317
I am concerned that
you know all of this.

36:14.318 --> 36:16.019
I'm a generalist.

36:20.074 --> 36:23.610
- Hey. Psst. Chapman.
- Yeah?

36:24.286 --> 36:25.487
Um...

36:26.121 --> 36:29.165
You think that growing up with
all that money was good for you?

36:29.166 --> 36:30.499
In what way?

36:30.500 --> 36:33.377
Like, did being a rich
person make you better?

36:33.378 --> 36:36.630
I bet you had, like, ballet,
music lessons and shit like that.

36:36.631 --> 36:40.134
Ballet, yeah, yeah. And I did
play the flute for two years.

36:40.135 --> 36:42.511
Although "play" is a very strong word.

36:42.512 --> 36:44.888
There's this flute face
that I could never...

36:44.889 --> 36:47.516
I never quite got right.

36:47.517 --> 36:51.763
Okay, so... it's a better
life when you have money?

36:52.606 --> 36:56.734
A lot of people expect it to
fill some sort of emotional hole,

36:56.735 --> 37:00.779
- and all it really does is buy stuff.
- Yeah, but what's wrong with stuff?

37:00.780 --> 37:05.118
Stuff is good. Especially when stuff
is food or a roof over your head.

37:05.119 --> 37:06.827
You know, there was this study

37:06.828 --> 37:12.583
that said, "Money does buy
happiness, up to $75,000 a year."

37:12.584 --> 37:16.462
But after that, increasing your
income doesn't make you any happier.

37:16.463 --> 37:17.921
75 grand is a lot.

37:17.922 --> 37:21.835
Yeah, no. I guess... I guess it is.

37:22.677 --> 37:24.296
Are you worried about...

37:25.180 --> 37:26.764
Yeah.

37:26.765 --> 37:28.175
[sighs]

37:29.268 --> 37:31.220
Love is the most important thing.

37:32.562 --> 37:34.981
Yeah, but money helps.

37:34.982 --> 37:39.735
Yeah, money does help. But you
know what? We both ended up here.

37:39.736 --> 37:42.814
[sighs] All right. Thanks.

37:45.075 --> 37:46.401
Hey, Dayanara?

37:47.619 --> 37:49.696
What size panties do you wear?

37:56.836 --> 37:58.337
Ay, damn.

37:58.338 --> 38:00.464
Any Jewy movies in here? Shit.

38:00.465 --> 38:02.425
Ain't all movies Jewy?

38:02.426 --> 38:05.344
Like Fiddler on the Roof
or some shit like that.

38:05.345 --> 38:09.390
- You know, half of them don't even play.
- [scoffs] Shit!

38:09.391 --> 38:12.143
I got to get ahead of this thing.

38:12.144 --> 38:14.645
Come and try and bust me for
not being the real Jew deal,

38:14.646 --> 38:16.772
I got to throw some
knowledge back at 'em.

38:16.773 --> 38:20.359
Well, look, shouldn't you be reading...
What's it called, the Jewish bible?

38:20.360 --> 38:24.113
No, I'm going for the Jewish
experience. You feel me?

38:24.114 --> 38:27.325
Get all cultural on them,
should be mad convincing.

38:27.326 --> 38:31.613
Man, I need some,
like... Seinfeld episodes.

38:32.039 --> 38:34.415
Oh! Ka-ching!

38:34.416 --> 38:38.001
Check it out! Woody fucking Allen.

38:38.002 --> 38:39.795
Now, that's some Jew shit right there.

38:39.796 --> 38:42.298
Look, come on, you really
think they gonna test us?

38:42.299 --> 38:44.967
And if they do, you think
Woody Allen is gonna save you?

38:44.968 --> 38:49.555
Oh, mark my words, they gonna test us.

38:49.556 --> 38:52.725
Y'all gonna be looking real
stupid, but when they come for us...

38:52.726 --> 38:53.851
I'm gonna be ready.

38:53.852 --> 38:56.305
[Crazy Eyes whistling]

38:59.149 --> 39:00.559
Yo, Suzanne.

39:02.569 --> 39:05.113
- I been reading your story.
- Okay.

39:05.114 --> 39:06.530
So?

39:06.531 --> 39:10.026
Who does Edwina choose? Gilly
or Space Admiral Rodcocker?

39:10.785 --> 39:14.072
- Uh, I haven't decided yet.
- You can't leave me hanging here.

39:14.873 --> 39:16.039
[chuckles]

39:16.040 --> 39:17.791
- Yeah, well, technically...
- Okay.

39:17.792 --> 39:19.960
...they're not even
in the same timeline.

39:19.961 --> 39:23.756
Admiral is in the future.
Gilead is in the past.

39:23.757 --> 39:29.095
And Edwina, she can move through
time, but only in one direction.

39:29.096 --> 39:32.973
Yeah, see, don't nobody care about
that. Right? They just wanna get off.

39:32.974 --> 39:34.384
You know?

39:35.935 --> 39:37.019
So, you liked it?

39:37.020 --> 39:39.438
You know, it's weird as fuck, right?

39:39.439 --> 39:42.400
- But it just... It sucked me in.
- Mmm-hmm. Uh-huh.

39:42.401 --> 39:46.445
I just got to kick back with some
bootleg and just escape from this place.

39:46.446 --> 39:50.032
I even lost track of time
reading it. Or I blacked out.

39:50.033 --> 39:52.951
Look, either way, this shit is hot.

39:52.952 --> 39:54.495
[Poussey giggling]

39:54.496 --> 39:57.748
Just don't leave a bitch with blue
balls. You know what I'm saying?

39:57.749 --> 39:59.208
Yes.

39:59.209 --> 40:01.210
- All right? You got me.
- [laughing] Yes.

40:01.211 --> 40:05.289
A'ight. Get to writing. Chop, chop.

40:06.716 --> 40:07.883
Hey, Joe.

40:07.884 --> 40:11.254
I, uh... [chuckling] heard about
the little incident out in the yard.

40:11.721 --> 40:13.306
The kid panicked.

40:13.307 --> 40:15.091
- Watch the plant.
- Right.

40:17.060 --> 40:18.936
He wasn't ready.

40:18.937 --> 40:21.980
And inmates can sue over things
like that. There was a case in Maine.

40:21.981 --> 40:25.769
No, no, no. You were right. It's my bad.

40:29.281 --> 40:32.450
Thank you. That's not how
we do things. It's dangerous.

40:32.451 --> 40:33.701
I hear you. What do you want?

40:33.702 --> 40:35.453
Another two-hour class
to go over procedure?

40:35.454 --> 40:39.122
I want a proper...
40-hour training period.

40:39.123 --> 40:41.785
How about we split the
difference? Six hours?

40:44.338 --> 40:46.004
I'll take what I can get.

40:46.005 --> 40:47.715
Joe, I'm doing my best
to work the system,

40:47.716 --> 40:49.883
but there's gonna be a
lot of changes around here,

40:49.884 --> 40:51.219
and I need you to be open-minded.

40:51.220 --> 40:53.721
We've got a whole new
plan for the kitchen,

40:53.722 --> 40:55.473
work details, processing,
a whole bunch of stuff.

40:55.474 --> 41:00.853
It's actually in the packet
here and... just whenever you...

41:00.854 --> 41:03.014
- I'm not gonna read those.
- Okay.

41:06.568 --> 41:09.362
- What do you do here?
- What do you mean?

41:09.363 --> 41:12.899
- What's your official title?
- I'm the Director of Human Activity.

41:13.783 --> 41:15.444
What does that even mean?

41:16.453 --> 41:18.036
[laughing] That sounds like God!

41:18.037 --> 41:19.455
[laughing] Yeah.

41:19.456 --> 41:20.789
No, I guess it does, it's...

41:20.790 --> 41:24.042
I have to be honest, this
whole corporate structure thing,

41:24.043 --> 41:25.336
I find it confusing.

41:25.337 --> 41:26.754
It's actually really simple.

41:26.755 --> 41:29.172
So, here, you mind if I...

41:29.173 --> 41:33.261
So, you got the... board, right?

41:33.262 --> 41:36.555
And then, you got the
CEO, you got the CFO,

41:36.556 --> 41:41.852
you got the various departments,
and then here's me, here's you.

41:41.853 --> 41:43.103
See, we're on the same level.

41:43.104 --> 41:46.064
You don't seem to have to
check with me to do anything.

41:46.065 --> 41:49.728
Because it actually flows this way.

41:51.029 --> 41:54.240
Through me... to you.

41:54.241 --> 41:56.992
So you're... you're my boss?

41:56.993 --> 42:01.740
No, no, no, we're on the same
level. It's just that the flow is...

42:02.832 --> 42:04.333
this way.

42:04.334 --> 42:06.209
You're basically the warden?

42:06.210 --> 42:09.255
No, no, no, 'cause that
position doesn't even exist.

42:09.256 --> 42:11.089
No, but it's what you are.

42:11.090 --> 42:15.761
I mean, if you are my boss,
then... you're a warden.

42:15.762 --> 42:17.971
No, no, no. We don't call
it that. I'm the Director...

42:17.972 --> 42:19.924
The Director of Human Activity.

42:27.524 --> 42:31.102
It's a shame. You were
really helping people, Norma.

42:31.736 --> 42:33.404
We still have that time in the chapel.

42:33.405 --> 42:35.365
What are we supposed
to do? Meet without you?

42:37.742 --> 42:39.528
Yeah, yeah.

42:47.377 --> 42:51.540
No, I'm fine. Maybe later.
My back is acting up.

42:53.675 --> 42:55.426
Aw.

42:55.427 --> 42:57.511
You're sweet, my friend.

42:57.512 --> 42:59.763
Oh. Thank you.

42:59.764 --> 43:01.007
[groans]

43:01.475 --> 43:03.767
The pain is moving around.

43:03.768 --> 43:06.770
It travels from my back, down my arms,

43:06.771 --> 43:09.898
sometimes in my hips.

43:09.899 --> 43:13.394
Lower. Lower, Norma. There.
There, there, there, there.

43:14.446 --> 43:15.855
[sighs]

43:18.367 --> 43:21.027
Makes my joints tense being there.

43:21.745 --> 43:24.955
Watching her strut
around like it's hers.

43:24.956 --> 43:27.875
Those tacos have no
idea what they're doing.

43:27.876 --> 43:31.538
I'm meant to be in charge, Norma.

43:35.967 --> 43:40.137
[chuckling] Of who,
you? No, I'm your friend.

43:40.138 --> 43:42.716
Your bossy friend,
but still, your friend.

43:45.560 --> 43:49.062
There was this time when
Vasily was only six months old,

43:49.063 --> 43:52.232
I had to leave him with my
sister-in-law for a week.

43:52.233 --> 43:55.318
We thought Yuri had the measles.

43:55.319 --> 43:59.573
When I came to get him, he cried,
and reached for her instead of me.

43:59.574 --> 44:02.401
Like she was his mother.

44:03.370 --> 44:08.282
[voice breaking] I know it sounds
crazy... but I have that same feeling now.

44:09.125 --> 44:12.411
That kitchen is my baby!

44:24.766 --> 44:28.052
Is this the thing you do? The magic?

44:29.813 --> 44:33.524
Well, stop it. I'm not
comfortable with that.

44:33.525 --> 44:36.310
Come on, Norma, let's get
back to the real thing.

44:40.907 --> 44:42.942
[music playing on radio]

44:49.123 --> 44:50.491
What is that?

44:51.835 --> 44:54.294
Why? What's the point?

44:54.295 --> 44:56.254
- We don't have any members.
- [turns off radio]

44:56.255 --> 44:59.292
And even if they wanted to
come, where would we gather?

45:00.927 --> 45:03.721
What, along the side
of the fucking highway?

45:03.722 --> 45:06.132
What next, rest-stop bathrooms?

45:07.141 --> 45:08.634
[Guru Mack sighs]

45:08.935 --> 45:13.765
All those wives, and I'm left
with you. My one true believer.

45:14.566 --> 45:16.817
So much for sacred vows.

45:16.818 --> 45:21.314
No way I'm going down on those
trumped-up bullshit charges.

45:23.407 --> 45:26.827
Those girls were there
of their own accord.

45:26.828 --> 45:29.030
And since when is
tithing against the law?

45:31.374 --> 45:33.083
We got to get off the grid.

45:33.084 --> 45:36.037
- Get back to the woods, commune with Gaia.
- [car rattling]

45:37.756 --> 45:39.297
[car backfiring]

45:39.298 --> 45:40.917
Shit!

45:42.761 --> 45:44.670
- [Guru Mack grunts]
- [tires squeal]

45:45.514 --> 45:49.266
You fucking piece of shit! Come on!

45:49.267 --> 45:51.469
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

45:54.856 --> 45:56.064
- [door slams]
- [Norma gasps]

45:56.065 --> 45:58.267
Oh, fuck!

45:59.402 --> 46:02.738
You bitch! You bitch!
You bitch! You bitch!

46:02.739 --> 46:06.025
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

46:06.743 --> 46:07.986
Come on!

46:09.495 --> 46:12.706
Bitch! God damn it!

46:12.707 --> 46:14.207
[Guru Mack groaning]

46:14.208 --> 46:15.409
Shit!

46:17.003 --> 46:21.131
One kick if you want money.

46:21.132 --> 46:24.176
Two kicks if you want to
live on 149th with Grandma.

46:24.177 --> 46:27.171
How about I give you three kicks
if you don't shut the fuck up?

46:28.557 --> 46:31.058
You're taking advice
from a fucking fetus now?

46:31.059 --> 46:35.062
Nice. You trust a stupid
little fetus more than me.

46:35.063 --> 46:36.939
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

46:36.940 --> 46:39.392
This is the right thing.

46:40.276 --> 46:43.779
What happens when you get out of here
and you can't even live in public housing

46:43.780 --> 46:45.113
'cause you got a record?

46:45.114 --> 46:49.485
And you gotta pull change out
of a sofa for a dollar meal?

46:50.829 --> 46:53.697
Why you think I've been
in a bad mood for 24 years?

46:56.209 --> 46:57.585
You've had your good days.

46:57.586 --> 46:58.828
[scoffs]

46:59.963 --> 47:01.330
Name one.

47:04.300 --> 47:06.252
My 17th birthday.

47:06.720 --> 47:11.098
You took me to the day
spa, we sat in the hot pool,

47:11.099 --> 47:13.016
we made fun of the lady
with the big ass mole.

47:13.017 --> 47:14.593
[both laugh]

47:15.269 --> 47:17.221
And we got our toes done.

47:18.982 --> 47:21.225
I was so happy that day.

47:21.943 --> 47:25.320
Because Cesar gave me a fistful of cash.

47:25.321 --> 47:27.114
You liked me because I
was buying you things.

47:27.115 --> 47:31.235
No. You were nice to me.

47:31.911 --> 47:33.662
Most of the time, you were such a bitch.

47:33.663 --> 47:36.782
Maybe I wouldn't have been
a bitch if we had money.

47:38.042 --> 47:41.830
All I ever wanted was
to spend time with you.

47:47.218 --> 47:49.587
You were stupid to want me.

47:50.554 --> 47:53.883
Kids are dumb, you gotta
make decisions for them.

47:55.018 --> 47:57.853
You're gonna put a kid in a car seat
and they're gonna scream and scream.

47:57.854 --> 48:00.534
You're not gonna take 'em out
and put 'em on your lap, are you?

48:00.606 --> 48:02.482
You used to make Emilio
ride in the trunk.

48:02.483 --> 48:03.734
That's not the point.

48:03.735 --> 48:08.321
Imagine you had some really rich
family who could really provide for you.

48:08.322 --> 48:12.159
You probably would be a famous
artist right now, instead of in here.

48:12.160 --> 48:15.196
You keep that baby,
you're being selfish.

48:17.957 --> 48:20.167
[Gloria] I had to remake
200 dinners from scratch

48:20.168 --> 48:24.046
because the tip of your fucking pinky
was floating around the stew somewhere.

48:24.047 --> 48:27.090
If you're gonna chop your finger off,
you couldn't do it away from my food?

48:27.091 --> 48:29.002
I'm having a hard day.

48:30.136 --> 48:33.013
- Why weren't you watching her?
- I can't do nothing with stupid.

48:33.014 --> 48:37.935
How am I supposed to be a mother to my
son when my prison kids keep fucking it up?

48:37.936 --> 48:40.896
- You could start with your language.
- Excuse me, what?

48:40.897 --> 48:42.690
[Sophia] Maybe try not to curse so much?

48:42.691 --> 48:46.234
Or at least tell your son not to.
At least not around my Michael.

48:46.235 --> 48:47.778
What are you talking about?

48:47.779 --> 48:49.780
My son has never cursed before.

48:49.781 --> 48:51.614
And one ride with your kid,

48:51.615 --> 48:54.284
and suddenly, it's "Fuck
this, and fuck that."

48:54.285 --> 48:57.746
He's 15. So what? He says "fuck."

48:57.747 --> 49:00.283
We don't talk like that in our house.

49:01.209 --> 49:06.205
You think my son is your son's problem?

49:08.216 --> 49:13.804
Tell Benny... to cool it with
the dirty jokes and language.

49:13.805 --> 49:16.215
That is, if he wants to keep his ride.

49:22.605 --> 49:23.939
[yelling in Spanish]

49:23.940 --> 49:25.607
Fuck me!

49:25.608 --> 49:28.693
Somebody keeps leaving the
handle over the fucking burner!

49:28.694 --> 49:30.278
Shit.

49:30.279 --> 49:33.656
Mendoza? What's this I hear about
Ramos cutting her finger off?

49:33.657 --> 49:35.868
It was just the tip of her pinky.

49:35.869 --> 49:38.912
I would've been here... I
would've cut her head off, too.

49:38.913 --> 49:42.916
Well, why weren't you here?
Your work duty takes priority.

49:42.917 --> 49:45.710
We have entrusted you
with a huge responsibility,

49:45.711 --> 49:49.589
and that means you can't take off
whenever you get a visitor or a headache.

49:49.590 --> 49:52.885
You know what gives me
a headache? This job!

49:52.886 --> 49:56.805
I gotta be there for my son
because he needs a mother!

49:56.806 --> 50:00.183
I didn't ask for this shit. You
know that my ankles are swollen.

50:00.184 --> 50:01.559
I got callouses!

50:01.560 --> 50:05.438
And then, my hair... [inhales
deeply] smells like canola oil.

50:05.439 --> 50:08.684
I fucking hate this place! I quit!

50:10.153 --> 50:12.771
You can't quit. This is prison.

50:14.657 --> 50:15.941
[sighs]

50:17.076 --> 50:18.819
And there's nobody else to do it.

50:25.459 --> 50:27.585
Jesus.

50:27.586 --> 50:30.672
Yeah, give it to her. I'm done.

50:30.673 --> 50:35.211
She wants this so bad...
[laughing] let her have it!

50:35.594 --> 50:36.920
[speaking Spanish]

50:40.058 --> 50:41.384
Okay, Reznikov.

50:42.143 --> 50:44.303
You're up. Enjoy.

51:14.968 --> 51:18.887
You know... you can cut an extra
one from that piece of fabric.

51:18.888 --> 51:19.972
I don't want them.

51:19.973 --> 51:23.600
Well, you could wear them until they're
really dirty and then give them to me.

51:23.601 --> 51:26.353
Okay, Chapman.

51:26.354 --> 51:30.224
No, no, it's not for
me. They're to, um...

51:31.817 --> 51:33.352
They're to sell to creepy dudes.

51:34.737 --> 51:36.230
Why would I wanna do that?

51:38.992 --> 51:41.152
Because I'm asking you.

51:43.412 --> 51:46.456
This is official Whispers merchandise.

51:46.457 --> 51:48.409
[laughs]

52:08.312 --> 52:09.722
[chuckles]

52:23.869 --> 52:25.870
- Piper, right?
- Yeah.

52:25.871 --> 52:28.081
- [gasps] Oh, you're the murderer!
- No.

52:28.082 --> 52:30.167
It's a long story, but
it's fine. She's fine.

52:30.168 --> 52:33.954
She probably is the person who took
you on a tour when you first got here.

52:34.797 --> 52:36.339
I didn't kill her.

52:36.340 --> 52:37.507
Oh, the little wiry one?

52:37.508 --> 52:40.135
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you should have killed her.

52:40.136 --> 52:43.714
But it's nice to see you, man!
We're a long way from Chicago.

52:46.475 --> 52:50.846
You know, I actually wanted to
apologize to you... about Chicago.

52:52.815 --> 52:55.275
I should have stepped in
when that woman jumped you.

52:55.276 --> 52:57.694
What? Come on. What
you gonna do about that?

52:57.695 --> 53:00.572
You're supposed to get your
ass beat over some stranger?

53:00.573 --> 53:04.117
- Come on, it's all right.
- That's kind of what I was thinking, yeah.

53:04.118 --> 53:06.203
Don't worry about it.

53:06.204 --> 53:10.491
Oh, and... how great is this place?

53:11.834 --> 53:14.077
Dude, I fucking love it here.

53:15.046 --> 53:17.214
Um, I am the kosher meal, please.

53:17.215 --> 53:20.168
- Hey, no. I was next.
- Are you?

53:28.267 --> 53:30.227
Smooth like butter.

53:30.228 --> 53:31.394
You, Captain Four Fingers,

53:31.395 --> 53:35.232
get those green beans off the
burner while they're still green!

53:35.233 --> 53:36.899
Norma, where's that corn bread?

53:36.900 --> 53:39.152
You've lost your speed, woman. Let's go.

53:39.153 --> 53:42.273
You're leaving a snail
trail on my floor.

53:44.408 --> 53:46.109
You're gonna put up with that?

53:49.080 --> 53:53.992
Norma, check on the line, make
sure those trays aren't cold.

53:54.585 --> 53:56.287
I saw that evil eye.

53:57.546 --> 54:00.465
[Guru Mack] I just... want to be a crow.

54:00.466 --> 54:04.086
Why can't I be a crow?

54:04.928 --> 54:10.426
I am a speck in the
universe. A miserable speck.

54:18.276 --> 54:19.484
[sighs]

54:19.485 --> 54:22.062
Why are you still here, Norma?

54:23.947 --> 54:29.744
Why are you following me...
after all these years? Go!

54:29.745 --> 54:34.325
Run away like the rest of them.
They were right, I'm a fraud.

54:35.126 --> 54:39.372
I'm a false prophet,
Norma. I'm not your God.

54:40.173 --> 54:44.167
You have wasted your
life on a worthless man.

54:45.344 --> 54:50.258
Human. Not special.
Not honest. Not good.

54:50.974 --> 54:53.185
And now, I'm old.

54:53.186 --> 54:58.807
And you're old and childless...
and poor and damned.

55:01.860 --> 55:02.985
[sobbing]

55:02.986 --> 55:04.187
Argh!

55:05.406 --> 55:07.650
You're never gonna leave, are you?

55:09.410 --> 55:11.779
Because you are a slave.

55:13.914 --> 55:16.166
A meek little servant.

55:16.167 --> 55:18.210
And you'll never be anything else.

55:18.211 --> 55:22.714
And If I didn't tell you where to go and
what to do, you would have no self at all.

55:22.715 --> 55:24.006
- Nothing!
- [gasps]

55:24.007 --> 55:25.925
Silent nothing!

55:25.926 --> 55:27.878
Worshipping nothing!

55:31.265 --> 55:33.175
Speak, woman.

55:34.435 --> 55:36.345
Fucking speak!

55:38.522 --> 55:39.973
You won't, will you?

55:40.983 --> 55:42.234
And you know why?

55:42.235 --> 55:45.112
Because you have nothing to say!

55:45.113 --> 55:46.480
[grunts]

55:47.281 --> 55:48.732
[Guru Mack screaming]

55:49.325 --> 55:50.651
[thuds]

55:51.369 --> 55:52.945
[crow cawing]

55:55.248 --> 55:58.116
[stuttering] Son of a...

55:59.210 --> 56:00.585
bitch!

56:00.586 --> 56:02.245
[sobbing]

56:07.593 --> 56:09.427
[Red] To a meal well done.

56:09.428 --> 56:12.889
You have embraced your
new general with dignity.

56:12.890 --> 56:14.891
[speaking Spanish] Did we have a choice?

56:14.892 --> 56:18.770
[speaking English] Not really, but
you did well anyway. I toast you all.

56:18.771 --> 56:20.772
[trolley approaching]

56:20.773 --> 56:23.183
Ladies, get ready to thank me.

56:25.819 --> 56:26.944
What is this?

56:26.945 --> 56:30.023
The wave of the future.

56:31.325 --> 56:33.694
Pre-packaged...

56:35.496 --> 56:37.448
boil in the bag meals.

56:37.956 --> 56:40.208
Your lives just got a
hell of a lot easier.

56:40.209 --> 56:42.786
Dump these babies in the steamer...

56:44.087 --> 56:45.297
and call it a day.

56:45.298 --> 56:47.799
[exclaims] Tell me this is a joke.

56:47.800 --> 56:50.385
No... it was a memo.

56:50.386 --> 56:54.256
From Jeffrey in Food Services
and Linda in Purchasing.

56:55.308 --> 57:00.012
You didn't think I'd put you in charge
if you actually had any power, did you?

57:01.355 --> 57:02.765
[clicks tongue]

57:04.107 --> 57:06.018
[inmates chuckling]

57:26.714 --> 57:28.631
She's not gonna come.

57:28.632 --> 57:31.092
Maybe we should take turns
leading the prayer circle?

57:31.093 --> 57:33.678
Or we could just keep
meeting with her one on one?

57:33.679 --> 57:36.214
But I thought the whole
point of this was to organize.

57:38.601 --> 57:39.927
[gasps]

57:40.811 --> 57:43.020
I told you. What did I tell you?

57:43.021 --> 57:46.349
Non-believers, all of you.
Nobody ever listens to me.

57:52.865 --> 57:54.407
What is she doing?

57:54.408 --> 57:56.444
- Shh!
- Oh, that felt good.

57:58.996 --> 58:00.573
[inmate] Oh, yeah.

58:01.749 --> 58:03.992
[sobbing] Oh, thank you.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.963
Wow.

58:08.964 --> 58:11.208
[inmates laughing]

58:17.473 --> 58:18.966
Do you feel that energy?

58:19.892 --> 58:22.143
Oh, my gosh, I'm feeling like
I'm glowing. Am I glowing?

58:22.144 --> 58:24.096
[all laughing]

58:29.402 --> 58:31.604
[folk-rock music playing]
