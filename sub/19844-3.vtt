WEBVTT

00:01.059 --> 00:03.195
- Previously on The Originals...
- Maxine.

00:03.198 --> 00:04.755
It's Adam... he never came home.

00:04.757 --> 00:06.357
I've looked everywhere.

00:06.359 --> 00:07.391
Hope?

00:07.393 --> 00:09.226
- I had a bad dream.
- It's all right.

00:09.228 --> 00:10.228
You're safe.

00:11.297 --> 00:13.430
Why are you doing this to me?

00:13.432 --> 00:15.419
Your grandma's
maiden name was Malraux.

00:15.422 --> 00:17.295
You're the last of your pack,
that makes you special.

00:17.297 --> 00:18.836
You got my venom. When do I get to go?

00:18.838 --> 00:20.871
I barely had enough
to make the antivenom.

00:20.873 --> 00:23.941
If any of my family are ever
bitten again, we'll need more.

00:25.678 --> 00:27.911
Marcel, yeah, this city is in danger.

00:27.913 --> 00:29.413
And it might just be all my fault.

00:29.415 --> 00:32.235
I can sense Klaus is
still in New Orleans.

00:32.238 --> 00:33.676
We free Niklaus today.

00:33.679 --> 00:36.120
This spell is strong. I'll
need someone to channel.

00:36.122 --> 00:38.255
Whatever happens, don't
stop until Niklaus is free.

00:38.257 --> 00:40.424
Nik!

00:40.426 --> 00:42.192
You're ready to see your little girl?

00:42.194 --> 00:43.901
- Want me to wake her for you?
- No.

00:43.904 --> 00:46.070
Let's let her sleep.

00:48.534 --> 00:50.634
What's the holdup?

00:50.636 --> 00:52.569
All right, we rescued Nik,
we escaped mortal danger...

00:52.571 --> 00:56.073
Why are we not on a
private jet to Saint-Tropez?

00:56.075 --> 00:58.275
You can catch up on the last five years

00:58.277 --> 01:00.110
when we're on our way... I assure you

01:00.112 --> 01:01.378
you haven't missed much.

01:01.380 --> 01:02.713
Circumstances have changed.

01:02.715 --> 01:04.515
We will leave here soon enough.

01:04.516 --> 01:05.883
We have our niece to consider.

01:05.885 --> 01:07.184
Kol has a point.

01:07.186 --> 01:09.687
We need to put an ocean between us

01:09.689 --> 01:11.522
and Marcel Gerard as soon as possible.

01:11.524 --> 01:12.890
We're not going anywhere today.

01:12.892 --> 01:14.725
I want one day of peace with my daughter

01:14.727 --> 01:15.859
before we uproot her.

01:15.861 --> 01:18.929
- Any delay is a risk.
- One day.

01:18.931 --> 01:21.131
We're in the middle of
nowhere, the house is cloaked,

01:21.133 --> 01:22.800
we weren't followed, and I'm not asking!

01:27.665 --> 01:30.494
Everybody, look who's awake.

01:38.751 --> 01:40.417
Hello.

01:42.021 --> 01:44.254
Hello.

01:45.391 --> 01:48.025
Mom, can I go play in the garden?

01:48.027 --> 01:49.193
Yeah.

01:49.195 --> 01:51.295
Sure.

Irascitur detruire.

02:35.674 --> 02:37.741
Eva, come on, where you been?

02:37.743 --> 02:39.276
- I was worried.
- I picked up

02:39.278 --> 02:41.378
your favorite jambalaya for dinner.

02:41.380 --> 02:43.347
Vince...

02:43.349 --> 02:45.783
I have news.

02:45.785 --> 02:47.184
You was in the Quarter?

02:47.186 --> 02:48.652
Come on, Eva, that's...

02:48.654 --> 02:50.320
that's Marcel Gerard's territory.

02:50.322 --> 02:52.923
And you know that's not
safe for witches there.

02:52.925 --> 02:54.691
The death toll is growing by the day.

02:54.693 --> 02:56.593
It isn't safe anywhere.

02:56.595 --> 02:59.663
Even the Tremé is
crawling with vampires.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.165
Why don't we leave?

03:01.167 --> 03:03.100
We could go anywhere.

03:03.102 --> 03:05.826
There's a whole world out there
with no Marcel to worry about.

03:05.829 --> 03:08.138
Eva, baby, I... I can't keep having

03:08.140 --> 03:09.873
this conversation with you.

03:09.875 --> 03:10.908
All right?

03:10.910 --> 03:13.110
This is my home.

03:13.112 --> 03:15.620
This is bigger than
the two of us, Vince.

03:18.225 --> 03:20.859
I was in the Quarter
to see Sophie Deveraux.

03:20.861 --> 03:23.662
She has a gift, you know?

03:25.066 --> 03:27.733
She knows when a woman is pregnant.

03:31.772 --> 03:34.006
I'm gonna be a daddy?

03:34.008 --> 03:36.041
Yes.

03:36.043 --> 03:37.309
Oh...

03:42.283 --> 03:45.117
You're going to be a great dad.

03:45.119 --> 03:47.419
But not here.

03:51.525 --> 03:54.460
Look, baby, wherever we go,

03:54.462 --> 03:56.913
our baby's gonna be a
part of my bloodline.

03:56.916 --> 03:59.450
And it won't be at peace if it's
not connected to its heritage.

03:59.453 --> 04:01.300
A heritage that could get us all killed

04:01.302 --> 04:03.469
- just for being who we are?
- No. See, because when

04:03.471 --> 04:05.731
I was growing up, this place
was a paradise for witches.

04:05.734 --> 04:08.169
This was the best place in the
world to be if you were a kid

04:08.172 --> 04:09.599
and you had a little bit
of magic in your bones.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.044
That's the New Orleans
I remember, and that's...

04:12.046 --> 04:14.346
the New Orleans I want
to raise our kid in.

04:15.983 --> 04:17.916
Give me six months, Eva.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.885
Baby, give me six
months, and I promise you

04:19.887 --> 04:22.120
I will find a way to
make sure Marcel Gerard

04:22.123 --> 04:23.722
never sets foot in the Tremé.

04:23.724 --> 04:26.325
Let me do that. Please.
Let me do that for you.

04:26.327 --> 04:28.827
Baby, let me do that for my kid.

04:30.865 --> 04:33.398
Okay.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.268
I got your message about the missing boy.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.670
My guys are out searching.

04:38.672 --> 04:41.774
Now, I'm gonna need
you to shed some light.

04:41.776 --> 04:43.509
How does one missing witch mean

04:43.511 --> 04:45.244
the whole city's in danger?

04:45.246 --> 04:47.212
You remember my wife Eva, right?

04:47.214 --> 04:48.614
Eva, yeah,

04:48.616 --> 04:50.167
the child-stealing psycho.

04:50.170 --> 04:52.203
Yeah, she wasn't always
like that, Marcel.

04:53.721 --> 04:55.825
What you saw was a shell.

04:55.828 --> 04:57.156
She was everything, man.

04:57.158 --> 04:59.224
She was smart, she was beautiful.

04:59.226 --> 05:02.890
She was just full of love and light.

05:02.893 --> 05:05.489
And then something evil
got inside of her, and it

05:05.491 --> 05:07.357
twisted her up.

05:07.359 --> 05:10.561
And it left nothing but darkness.

05:10.563 --> 05:13.463
And now I think that that same
darkness has come back again.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.660
Eva was trying to
sacrifice nine children.

05:17.663 --> 05:19.703
Now, do you really think
that somebody is...?

05:19.705 --> 05:21.838
Man, Adam Folsom was only the first.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.074
Whoever is doing this...

05:24.076 --> 05:25.943
they're gonna want more.

05:31.283 --> 05:33.817
What terrible things did you tell her?

05:33.819 --> 05:38.789
I told her that you're a hybrid, like me.

05:38.791 --> 05:41.658
I also told her that you're very old.

05:41.660 --> 05:43.093
Other than that, she's seven...

05:43.095 --> 05:45.262
We can wait to share the gory details.

05:45.264 --> 05:46.930
Well, someone must have disparaged me.

05:46.932 --> 05:49.466
- Perhaps that crone, Mary...
- Stop.

05:49.468 --> 05:50.634
I've spent

05:50.636 --> 05:52.502
five years protecting
her from everything,

05:52.504 --> 05:55.405
including all the horror stories
floating around about you.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.507
She doesn't know your
history. What she does know

05:57.509 --> 05:59.076
is that you protect your family,

05:59.078 --> 06:00.677
no matter what.

06:00.679 --> 06:02.713
And yet she fears me.

06:02.715 --> 06:04.114
She's a sensitive kid.

06:04.116 --> 06:07.184
And you're not exactly calm right now.

06:13.993 --> 06:17.094
You were her fairy tale prince, Klaus.

06:17.096 --> 06:18.829
And now you're real.

06:18.831 --> 06:21.098
You have a lot to live up to.

06:27.906 --> 06:31.842
Now that our brother
has found his noble purpose,

06:31.844 --> 06:33.343
what about you?

06:33.345 --> 06:35.379
Let's give him the
day with his daughter.

06:35.381 --> 06:37.581
Tomorrow we seek sanctuary elsewhere.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.383
That's not what I meant, is it?

06:40.819 --> 06:42.786
You're no longer tethered to him.

06:42.788 --> 06:45.022
You must have thought about it. So...

06:45.024 --> 06:47.658
what will you do with your immortality,

06:47.660 --> 06:50.127
now you're not burdened
with saving Nik's soul?

06:50.130 --> 06:52.130
I don't know.

06:55.768 --> 06:57.868
And what of you?

06:57.870 --> 07:00.037
Do you still desire
a family of your own?

07:00.039 --> 07:03.907
Well, true love continues to elude me.

07:03.909 --> 07:05.776
Though certainly there's
an app for that now.

07:05.778 --> 07:08.478
I am sorry. I know the
way you felt about Marcel.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.982
We have the opportunity
for a fresh start.

07:11.984 --> 07:15.552
Perhaps we should both
use this one quiet day

07:15.554 --> 07:18.822
to decide what we want
our new beginning to be.

07:41.947 --> 07:43.714
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.

07:45.617 --> 07:48.218
Yeah, but you're just trying
to help your family. I get it.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.253
Looks like they're really suffering.

07:50.255 --> 07:53.623
Did their mimosas go flat at brunch?

07:56.389 --> 07:58.762
You're all cut up.
Why aren't you healing?

07:58.764 --> 08:00.897
You know, I never really bought into

08:00.899 --> 08:03.066
that whole wolf pack mentality.

08:03.068 --> 08:05.535
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

08:06.772 --> 08:09.539
But I'm a model citizen compared to you.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.842
A werewolf queen that
betrays her own kind

08:11.844 --> 08:15.212
for a bunch of vampires...
It's disgusting.

08:15.214 --> 08:17.447
Why is her mask off? We need

08:17.449 --> 08:20.016
- as much venom as we can get.
- She needed a break.

08:20.018 --> 08:21.985
She'll live. If we
don't get enough venom

08:21.987 --> 08:23.453
to make more of the cure,

08:23.455 --> 08:25.522
my brothers won't be so fortunate.

08:26.358 --> 08:28.325
Do what you need to do.

08:28.327 --> 08:30.393
I can'n'breathe in here.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.879
That's lovely.

08:52.050 --> 08:55.218
Mom said you like to paint, too.

08:55.220 --> 08:56.787
I do.

08:56.789 --> 08:58.421
Very much.

09:40.732 --> 09:43.233
Never gonna get used to that.

09:44.937 --> 09:46.336
Will.

09:46.338 --> 09:48.405
Thanks for coming, man.
You got some news for me?

09:48.407 --> 09:49.940
Not the good kind.

09:49.942 --> 09:51.741
Adam Folsom isn't our only case.

09:51.743 --> 09:53.810
We've got three additional
reports of missing kids.

09:55.447 --> 09:58.281
Look, Vince, maybe this
isn't your kind of case.

09:58.283 --> 09:59.517
Let me conduct my investigation.

09:59.519 --> 10:01.251
I'll let you know if
anything supernatural happens.

10:01.253 --> 10:03.597
I need for you to stay
out of this one, okay?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.555
I need you to make sure the
cops stay out of this one...

10:05.557 --> 10:07.791
I'm not gonna leave you alone
to deal with four missing kids.

10:07.793 --> 10:09.492
I'm not gonna be alone... I
got Marcel and his vampires.

10:09.494 --> 10:11.261
- I still don't trust Marcel.
- I don't...

10:11.263 --> 10:13.196
Yeah, well, that's just too bad.

10:13.198 --> 10:15.532
Because I'm the only guy
here getting anything done.

10:15.534 --> 10:17.567
One of my guys spotted some lights

10:17.569 --> 10:18.935
at the old Strix mansion.

10:18.937 --> 10:20.770
Now, the place has been
boarded up for years.

10:20.772 --> 10:23.773
All of a sudden, lock is
busted off the front gate.

10:23.775 --> 10:25.642
- I should call this in.
- Will,

10:25.644 --> 10:27.477
man, I'm trying to protect you.

10:27.479 --> 10:29.512
Fine.

10:29.514 --> 10:32.048
These kidnappings are
gonna hit the press, Vince.

10:32.050 --> 10:34.851
My guess, you have till
the end of the day, at best.

10:39.057 --> 10:41.791
Let's go to work.

10:43.228 --> 10:44.694
Hey, hold up.

10:47.623 --> 10:49.165
Weren't you just soaking this thing

10:49.167 --> 10:50.800
in lighter fluid this morning?

10:58.256 --> 10:59.822
Marcel, do me a favor.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.859
I want you to keep that
book far away from me.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.882
If I even try to come for
it, I want you to kill me.

11:21.323 --> 11:23.156
Oh, here you are.

11:23.158 --> 11:25.523
Wherever there are booze and boobs.

11:25.526 --> 11:27.926
Yeah, I came in here to
have a quiet bite alone,

11:27.929 --> 11:30.765
- thank you very much.
- Well, go and be alone somewhere else,

11:30.768 --> 11:33.136
because I have some thinking
to do, and I would like to do it

11:33.138 --> 11:34.200
near the expensive wine.

11:34.202 --> 11:37.036
After five years of being
trapped in a house together,

11:37.038 --> 11:40.240
here we are... trapped
in a house together.

11:40.242 --> 11:43.109
Well, at least this one
doesn't have imaginary blood.

11:43.111 --> 11:45.478
It's not normal.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.314
Living in each other's
pockets for a thousand years.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.683
Paranoia, betrayal,

11:50.685 --> 11:53.023
violence, repeat.

11:53.026 --> 11:56.089
Well, we're undead, so if
it's normal you're after,

11:56.091 --> 11:58.124
I don't fancy your chances.

11:58.126 --> 11:59.893
And why the sudden
melancholy? Did you expect

11:59.895 --> 12:02.128
to break out of the Chambre de Chasse

12:02.130 --> 12:04.063
and into a family cured of dysfunction?

12:04.065 --> 12:06.199
When we were in there,

12:06.201 --> 12:07.901
it felt like the world had stopped.

12:07.903 --> 12:09.269
But it didn't.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.105
It kept turning. Without Davina.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.208
You know, she would have been 23 today.

12:15.210 --> 12:18.745
And I wonder what she would
have done with the time.

12:20.048 --> 12:22.148
She would have made the
world a better place.

12:23.491 --> 12:25.157
Meanwhile...

12:25.160 --> 12:27.587
we're here, breathing.

12:27.589 --> 12:29.422
And what are we doing?

12:29.424 --> 12:32.425
Paranoia, betrayal,

12:32.427 --> 12:35.662
violence, repeat.

12:39.034 --> 12:41.034
This isn't a punishment.

12:41.036 --> 12:43.102
It's a necessary evil.

12:43.104 --> 12:46.773
Most people who do evil convince
themselves it's necessary.

12:49.277 --> 12:50.944
Relax.

12:50.946 --> 12:52.445
It's for your wounds.

12:56.685 --> 12:57.851
You're a wolf.

12:57.853 --> 13:00.620
Why aren't you healing?

13:01.590 --> 13:05.158
I dated an orthopedic surgeon.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.293
One morning, I'm trying
to impress her on a hike

13:07.295 --> 13:08.828
and I take a spill.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.598
Broke my ankle, double
compound fracture.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.234
And she was all about helping
me rehabehntil the next day,

13:14.236 --> 13:16.035
she saw that I was good as new.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.704
She freaked.

13:17.706 --> 13:21.574
Being a medical anomaly can suck.

13:21.576 --> 13:23.943
So you had a witch do a spell

13:23.945 --> 13:25.512
to slow your healing process?

13:25.514 --> 13:26.946
No. I swiped a badge,

13:26.948 --> 13:29.949
accessed the path lab.
Used my tissue sample

13:29.951 --> 13:32.685
to analyze the chemotaxis
of my body's enzymes...

13:35.624 --> 13:39.259
Look, even a monster is
still a biological organism.

13:39.261 --> 13:42.161
Exposed to the right chemicals,

13:42.163 --> 13:43.730
it can be weakened or strengthened,

13:43.732 --> 13:45.064
so I devised a treatment

13:45.066 --> 13:48.134
to help suppress my werewolf traits.

13:48.136 --> 13:50.370
It wasn't magic, it was medicine.

13:56.011 --> 13:59.512
Now, I know you've seen a
lot of crazy over the years...

14:01.516 --> 14:03.917
but I've never seen you scared.

14:03.919 --> 14:06.185
All right, you gonna tell me
what we're up against here?

14:06.187 --> 14:08.588
The past.

14:08.590 --> 14:10.890
Your past, my past.

14:12.027 --> 14:13.927
Eight years ago, you
were running this city

14:13.929 --> 14:15.628
with an iron fist.

14:15.630 --> 14:18.831
Well, you had a lot of witches
terrified at every single turn.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.199
I was protecting Davina...

14:20.201 --> 14:22.335
Yeah, well, I had
something to protect, too.

14:22.337 --> 14:24.837
And I wanted to take you down, Marcel.

14:24.839 --> 14:27.006
For my wife.

14:27.008 --> 14:30.376
For my unborn kid.

14:30.378 --> 14:32.278
So...

14:32.280 --> 14:33.947
I start looking for forms of magic

14:33.949 --> 14:36.115
that you can't defend against.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.286
Can't find anything.

14:40.288 --> 14:42.622
And then, one night,
I walk into my house

14:42.624 --> 14:45.091
and I find tnotebook
just sittingn my table.

14:46.661 --> 14:49.028
It's an instruction manual.

14:49.030 --> 14:50.663
Sacrificial magic, but it's not like

14:50.665 --> 14:53.032
anything I've ever
seen practiced anywhere.

15:00.203 --> 15:02.530
It made me feel invincible.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.681
It's not like you're the
first New Orleans witch

15:08.683 --> 15:10.483
to make a sacrifice to his ancestors.

15:10.485 --> 15:12.218
This is not to the ancestors,
Marcel, this is something

15:12.220 --> 15:14.287
different. This is something
older than the ancestors.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.989
And the book never gave it a name.

15:15.991 --> 15:18.024
Okay, so who gave you the book?

15:18.026 --> 15:20.393
- A witch must have planted it or...
- That's the thing, Marcel...

15:20.395 --> 15:22.962
The book's written in my handwriting.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.431
And I don't remember writing it.

15:40.081 --> 15:41.648
Let me guess.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.850
You want the world to disappear.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.452
Not the whole world.

15:46.454 --> 15:48.287
You can stay.

15:48.289 --> 15:50.323
Hope, too.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.292
Klaus can visit on
the weekends, I guess.

15:55.764 --> 15:59.428
I betrayed a lot of people over
the last five years, Elijah.

15:59.431 --> 16:03.478
Killed people just to cover
my tracks, keep Hope safe.

16:03.481 --> 16:05.756
I was ruthless.

16:05.759 --> 16:08.206
You were a Mikaelson.

16:08.209 --> 16:13.282
You did what you had to do.

16:13.285 --> 16:15.715
The truth is, I'd...

16:15.717 --> 16:18.151
do it all again.

16:19.421 --> 16:20.987
I told myself a hundred times

16:20.989 --> 16:22.889
that it was all for Hope, but

16:22.891 --> 16:26.392
maybe I did it for selfish reasons, too.

16:26.394 --> 16:28.127
When I wasn't with my daughter,

16:28.129 --> 16:31.197
all I thought about was you.

16:44.245 --> 16:46.913
I should be happy right now,

16:46.915 --> 16:50.850
but there's one of my kind in a barn,

16:50.852 --> 16:54.721
miserable and scared,

16:54.723 --> 16:57.423
and she doesn't deserve to be there.

16:58.793 --> 17:00.593
Release her.

17:01.441 --> 17:02.908
If Marcel finds you...

17:02.911 --> 17:05.598
You can't do this forever.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.500
Your life is more than the salvation

17:07.502 --> 17:09.868
of the Mikaelson
family. Now, trust me...

17:11.172 --> 17:13.271
...you'll lose yourself.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.214
I painted on animal skins, mostly.

17:21.215 --> 17:23.148
Bark, cave walls...

17:23.151 --> 17:25.050
You lived in a cave?

17:25.053 --> 17:26.385
I lived in a hovel,

17:26.387 --> 17:28.387
all of us crowded into two rooms.

17:28.388 --> 17:30.406
It was actually nicer than it sounds.

17:30.409 --> 17:32.309
Though your Uncle Kol snored.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.478
Loudly, I might add.

17:33.481 --> 17:36.929
I bet it was cool, always having

17:36.931 --> 17:38.898
other kids to play with.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.367
It was cool, actually.

17:41.369 --> 17:43.005
But I still felt alone.

17:43.008 --> 17:45.409
Different from my siblings.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.994
For one thing, I loved art.
I used to make my own paints

17:47.996 --> 17:49.829
from flowers and berries.

17:49.831 --> 17:52.866
These orange ones are the most vibrant.

17:52.868 --> 17:54.534
I like orange.

17:54.536 --> 17:57.504
Oh, there's a butterfly.

17:57.506 --> 17:59.539
I think it's stuck.

17:59.541 --> 18:02.776
Yeah, it has a broken wing.

18:09.284 --> 18:12.085
Shh. Don't tell my mom.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.951
You're free to go.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.560
A few parting words.

18:53.562 --> 18:55.895
As long as you're alive,
you will be hunted.

18:55.897 --> 18:58.665
You can't go back to your old
life. You need to disappear.

19:00.135 --> 19:01.768
Someone's coming. Go now.

19:08.443 --> 19:11.011
Where is she?

19:11.013 --> 19:13.647
- I had to, Freya.
- Had to what...

19:13.649 --> 19:15.281
Sentence my family to death?

19:15.283 --> 19:16.750
Yeah, I'm going after her.

19:17.953 --> 19:19.786
I don't think so.

19:23.987 --> 19:25.097
Move.

19:27.191 --> 19:29.209
I can do much worse.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.812
- Stay out of my way.
- Freya, stop.

19:31.814 --> 19:33.780
We have enough venom to make the cure.

19:33.782 --> 19:35.315
We don't need an endless supply.

19:35.317 --> 19:37.017
Let's just hit the road, avoid Marcel...

19:37.019 --> 19:39.753
Marcel could be handing out
vials of his venom to anyone.

19:39.755 --> 19:41.588
We can't avoid a threat
that could be everywhere.

19:41.590 --> 19:43.323
Keelin shouldn't suffer for that.

19:43.325 --> 19:45.325
Oh, now, suddenly you're the
arbiter of right and wrong?

19:45.327 --> 19:47.427
I've done plenty wrong
in my life, Freya.

19:47.429 --> 19:49.062
But things are different now.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.031
I have a sweet little
girl who's going around

19:51.033 --> 19:53.300
healing injured
fireflies with her magic.

19:53.302 --> 19:55.602
If we're keeping someone
captive in our barn,

19:55.604 --> 19:57.137
she's gonna have questions...

19:57.139 --> 19:58.905
Then tell her that
the world's a bad place

19:58.907 --> 20:01.374
and that sometimes we have
to do bad things to survive.

20:01.376 --> 20:02.976
She'll be safer if
she learns that early.

20:02.978 --> 20:05.412
It's not her job to keep herself safe.

20:05.414 --> 20:06.813
It's mine. It's ours.

20:06.815 --> 20:08.915
And that includes
protecting her innocence.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.284
She's a Mikaelson... she can
live without her innocence.

20:11.286 --> 20:13.086
She can't live without her family.

20:13.088 --> 20:14.955
She's a Mikaelson, and you're...

20:14.957 --> 20:17.524
Enough.

20:17.526 --> 20:20.627
Before you say something you'll regret.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.763
Thank you, brother.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.164
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:24.166 --> 20:25.499
I have a wolf to hunt.

20:28.804 --> 20:30.804
You will let her go.

20:32.140 --> 20:34.441
Fine.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.750
I didn't know you back then.

20:43.752 --> 20:45.418
- When you were with Eva.
- No.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.521
Well, I sure as hell knew you.

20:47.523 --> 20:51.892
Mm. I guess war wounds never heal.

20:51.894 --> 20:53.994
It wasn't a war, Marcel.

20:53.996 --> 20:55.695
No, it wasn't a war, it was a slaughter.

20:55.697 --> 20:57.597
You see, witches that didn't your rules,

20:57.599 --> 20:59.533
- they got slaughtered.
- Yeah, you blame me

20:59.535 --> 21:02.168
- for what happened. For losing her.
- What happened to Eva

21:02.170 --> 21:04.471
was because of me, it
wasn't because of you.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.941
Every day I try to forget that.

21:07.943 --> 21:10.076
Every day I lose.

21:18.453 --> 21:20.954
You never came to bed.

21:20.956 --> 21:25.959
I'm just trying to
figure this... o-out.

21:25.961 --> 21:28.128
I've been sacrificing goats and snakes,

21:28.130 --> 21:29.696
but it doesn't seem to be enough.

21:29.698 --> 21:31.965
It's like it needs something more.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.400
You need sleep, Vince.

21:33.402 --> 21:35.035
Eva, this is for us.

21:35.037 --> 21:36.770
All right? Imagine this.

21:36.772 --> 21:39.372
Enough power that we ain't got to worry

21:39.374 --> 21:40.640
about raising a kid in fear

21:40.642 --> 21:42.142
of Marcel Gerard.

21:42.144 --> 21:43.977
Have a kid that is learning magic

21:43.979 --> 21:46.646
because of all the right
reasons, for the joy of it

21:46.648 --> 21:48.348
and because it fulfills
the soul, instead of because

21:48.350 --> 21:49.849
it needs to protect itself.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.187
Okay.

21:54.189 --> 21:55.655
Then show me.

21:55.657 --> 21:57.657
No.

21:57.659 --> 21:59.893
No, Eva. This is too powerful.

21:59.895 --> 22:01.962
Oh, really?

22:01.964 --> 22:04.998
I hope you're not
questioning my magical skill.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.367
We're a team, right?

22:07.369 --> 22:08.935
Always.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.711
I imagine a true sacrifice

22:18.714 --> 22:21.247
must be something truly loved.

22:54.583 --> 22:57.083
Donez moi...

22:57.085 --> 22:58.451
Donez moi...

22:58.453 --> 23:00.086
...fortitudo.

23:00.088 --> 23:01.388
...fortitudo.

23:01.390 --> 23:03.556
Apporte moi...

23:03.558 --> 23:05.058
Apporte moi...

23:05.060 --> 23:07.093
...potestatem.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.628
...potestatem.

23:08.630 --> 23:11.331
Donez moi fortitudo.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.567
Apporte moi potestatem.

23:14.569 --> 23:17.771
Donez moi fortitudo.

23:17.773 --> 23:21.508
Apporte moi potestatem.

23:21.510 --> 23:23.176
Something truly loved.

23:23.178 --> 23:25.011
That's why she started sacrificing kids.

23:25.013 --> 23:28.048
Eva was committed to that power.

23:28.050 --> 23:30.850
And she was willing to go
further with it than I was.

23:30.852 --> 23:32.352
And that scared me.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.090
We both agreed to stop.

23:37.092 --> 23:38.892
And then one day...

23:38.894 --> 23:42.128
babies started going
missing from their beds.

23:48.236 --> 23:51.705
Mom says when I get bigger,
Freya will teach me real spells.

23:51.707 --> 23:54.274
I think you're doing
rather well all by yourself.

23:54.276 --> 23:57.210
I can't always control it so well.

23:57.212 --> 23:59.813
It scares me sometimes.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.583
You, luv,

24:03.585 --> 24:06.419
are the daughter of Klaus Mikaelson.

24:06.421 --> 24:09.122
You're going to be the greatest
witch the world has ever seen.

24:09.124 --> 24:10.957
And nothing will scare you.

24:10.959 --> 24:13.560
I know what you are, you know.

24:14.632 --> 24:16.966
The strongest in the world.

24:16.969 --> 24:19.332
Strong enough to keep all
of the bad things away.

24:19.334 --> 24:20.934
What bad things?

24:20.936 --> 24:23.336
Just bad guys. Monsters.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.171
People who are mean,

24:25.173 --> 24:27.874
selfish, and angry.

24:27.876 --> 24:30.710
Nothing is going to harm my little girl.

24:30.712 --> 24:32.512
Nothing will even get close.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.447
You're all that matters to me.

24:42.837 --> 24:44.357
You're trembling.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.959
Are you cold?

24:45.961 --> 24:48.595
Yeah. I've been cold a while now.

24:48.597 --> 24:50.430
Well, let's get you inside then, eh?

24:50.432 --> 24:53.099
You can show me your drawings.

25:07.254 --> 25:10.622
My daughter is an art prodigy.

25:10.624 --> 25:12.924
Well, she's far better
than you ever were.

25:12.926 --> 25:14.926
Granted, the bar is very low.

25:14.928 --> 25:17.996
True art is lost on the feeble-minded.

25:21.168 --> 25:24.369
Kol wanted me to say good-bye.

25:26.473 --> 25:29.007
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

25:29.009 --> 25:30.875
What's he chasing this time?

25:30.877 --> 25:32.310
Does it matter?

25:32.312 --> 25:33.912
He'll return.

25:33.914 --> 25:36.214
He always was a selfish git.

25:36.216 --> 25:39.017
He died twice and
spent five years trapped

25:39.019 --> 25:40.585
in Freya's beige dreamland.

25:40.587 --> 25:42.887
You can forgive him a bit of wanderlust.

25:42.889 --> 25:45.190
I don't see you packing your bags.

25:49.408 --> 25:53.465
Nik, you do not need me anymore.

25:53.467 --> 25:56.968
I know that I'm your favorite
sibling, and of course

25:56.970 --> 25:58.970
I adore you.

25:58.972 --> 26:01.673
But there's space in my
heart for something more.

26:01.675 --> 26:03.441
I want love.

26:03.443 --> 26:06.077
I want a family of my own.

26:06.079 --> 26:08.313
And wouldn't it be nice if we could part

26:08.315 --> 26:10.915
on happy terms for once?

26:10.917 --> 26:13.718
No daggers, no exile.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.087
Just... so long for now.

26:16.089 --> 26:18.523
I'll see you again soon.

26:26.409 --> 26:28.576
You were the only one

26:28.578 --> 26:32.680
who never treated me like a misfit.

26:32.682 --> 26:36.350
For centuries, my only
place was by your side.

26:37.387 --> 26:41.889
And now I belong beside my daughter.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.824
And I suppose you deserve to find

26:43.826 --> 26:45.793
your place in the world as well.

26:45.795 --> 26:47.962
Thank you.

26:59.236 --> 27:00.941
Was she asleep?

27:00.943 --> 27:04.578
With her muddy shoes on.

27:04.580 --> 27:08.182
Who else do I know that does that?

27:09.619 --> 27:11.719
Expecting company?

27:11.721 --> 27:14.622
Yeah. She should be here any second.

27:14.625 --> 27:16.816
I think you're gonna like her.

27:27.570 --> 27:29.704
You okay?

27:33.643 --> 27:36.110
Rebekah asked me something,

27:36.112 --> 27:39.246
who I might be if Niklaus
no longer needed me.

27:39.248 --> 27:42.383
Did I have any desires of my own?

27:42.385 --> 27:44.051
And I thought about it.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.553
There was a time, long ago,

27:45.555 --> 27:49.657
I do recall, I wanted more.

27:49.659 --> 27:52.526
Somehow I have...

27:52.528 --> 27:54.895
I lost the feelings

27:54.897 --> 27:57.998
- beneath blood and chaos.
- Hey.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.302
You can't let the bad things
that you did in your past

28:01.304 --> 28:02.803
define you.

28:02.805 --> 28:04.972
I know you.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.274
You are good.

28:08.878 --> 28:12.513
No, you are good.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.954
I was wrong when I said
that you were a Mikaelson.

28:19.956 --> 28:21.188
You're not a Mikaelson.

28:21.190 --> 28:24.191
You don't have a Mikaelson heart.

28:24.193 --> 28:27.728
There's just too muchmuood in you.

28:30.467 --> 28:32.667
It's why I love you.

28:36.539 --> 28:39.106
I love you, too.

29:16.612 --> 29:17.711
Please, please, please.

29:25.788 --> 29:27.922
Come on.

29:36.999 --> 29:40.468
I told you I can't let you go.

29:41.270 --> 29:42.970
So you have a choice.

29:42.972 --> 29:44.405
Come back with me,

29:44.407 --> 29:46.841
or I will make this hurt.

30:12.314 --> 30:13.713
Get away from them!

30:31.721 --> 30:33.921
I know you.

30:36.726 --> 30:38.759
Vincent Griffith.

30:38.761 --> 30:40.361
How do you know my name?

30:40.363 --> 30:42.363
Because you have been me.

30:42.365 --> 30:44.632
It is happy you're here.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.834
It wants you here.

30:46.836 --> 30:48.469
It wants me here?

30:48.471 --> 30:50.371
What are you talking about?

30:50.373 --> 30:51.739
It is that thing,

30:51.741 --> 30:54.875
the thing that resides within this city.

30:54.877 --> 30:57.378
Within all of us.

30:57.380 --> 30:58.779
It is in you.

30:58.781 --> 31:00.814
Loving you.

31:00.816 --> 31:03.784
As it loved your wife.

31:16.432 --> 31:17.998
Casser les os.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.266
Casser les os.

31:46.725 --> 31:48.592
With which eye

31:48.594 --> 31:51.428
would you most prefer to view your end?

32:04.009 --> 32:06.343
Let it be done.

32:22.728 --> 32:25.462
Dad?

32:28.934 --> 32:31.601
I think something's wrong.

32:35.407 --> 32:37.007
Let him go.

32:37.009 --> 32:38.742
Let him go right now.

32:39.778 --> 32:41.411
Did you think you were unique, Vincent?

32:41.413 --> 32:43.914
That it had chosen only you?

32:43.916 --> 32:45.749
I had a dream...

32:45.751 --> 32:48.451
about a bad man.

32:48.453 --> 32:50.954
He was hurting these kids

32:50.956 --> 32:54.658
and I think he hurt me, too.

32:54.660 --> 32:56.393
Don't you see?

32:56.395 --> 32:58.328
You freed it, Vincent.

32:58.330 --> 33:00.230
You gave it breath.

33:00.232 --> 33:02.666
And now it must be fed.

33:17.716 --> 33:19.582
I feel dizzy.

33:19.584 --> 33:23.186
And my head hurts. Hayley!

33:23.188 --> 33:25.388
Oh, Marcel, the spell
is already in motion.

33:25.390 --> 33:27.123
It's draining the
life out of these kids.

33:28.126 --> 33:29.492
They're freezing.

33:33.699 --> 33:37.267
Mom, I'm so cold.

33:41.340 --> 33:42.872
Vincent, what the hell is this?

33:44.543 --> 33:47.811
That witch, he used their personal items

33:47.813 --> 33:49.212
to bind them to the spell.

33:49.214 --> 33:51.214
Totems.

33:51.216 --> 33:54.050
I know this magic, I-I can reverse it.

33:55.320 --> 33:57.654
Nettoyer timoun sa yo,

33:57.656 --> 34:01.658
nettoyer timoun sa yo.

34:06.898 --> 34:08.697
- Vincent?
- Oh.

34:08.699 --> 34:10.833
Yeah, man.

34:10.835 --> 34:12.369
Yeah, you're okay.

34:12.371 --> 34:14.871
Can you stand for me?

34:14.873 --> 34:16.339
There you go.

34:20.545 --> 34:22.344
Marcel, we've got five totems

34:22.347 --> 34:24.179
and we got four kids.

34:24.181 --> 34:26.583
Okay, so who's the other kid?

34:47.714 --> 34:49.414
Nice car.

34:49.416 --> 34:51.116
Hey, do you mind if I borrow it?

34:55.188 --> 34:56.788
I knew you'd like this car.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.924
You're so predictable.

34:58.926 --> 35:00.084
What are you doing?

35:00.087 --> 35:01.693
Well, I'm due an adventure,

35:01.695 --> 35:04.129
and Saint-Tropez is
as good a place as any.

35:05.498 --> 35:08.366
Besides, someone's got to
keep you out of trouble.

35:27.955 --> 35:29.854
Paramedics took the kids to the hospital

35:29.856 --> 35:31.289
to get checked out.

35:31.291 --> 35:34.259
NOLA PD will notify the parents.

35:34.261 --> 35:35.460
Looks like you're a hero.

35:35.462 --> 35:37.668
Adam could have died.

35:37.671 --> 35:39.464
All those kids could have died,

35:39.466 --> 35:40.699
and I'm gonna tell you something,

35:40.701 --> 35:42.567
if Hope Mikaelson is
linked to that spell,

35:42.569 --> 35:43.802
she's gonna die.

35:43.804 --> 35:46.304
We've got to get her back here.

35:46.306 --> 35:49.074
We got to cast a cleansing
spell on New Orleans soil.

35:49.077 --> 35:50.145
I just got rid of them.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.480
Well, bring them back, Marcel.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.614
She's a kid, all right?

35:53.617 --> 35:55.547
And she's practically your sister.

35:58.385 --> 36:01.519
She's never been sick, ever.

36:01.521 --> 36:04.189
This is a magical affliction.

36:04.992 --> 36:06.358
It feels...

36:06.360 --> 36:08.693
I don't know, it's hard to explain.

36:08.695 --> 36:11.863
Almost... cold.

36:29.583 --> 36:31.616
It's from Vincent Griffith.

36:31.618 --> 36:34.853
He knows what's wrong
with Hope, he can cure her.

36:38.125 --> 36:41.026
But we have to go back to New Orleans.

36:45.632 --> 36:47.732
It's done. All right, fine.

36:47.734 --> 36:49.401
You meet them.

36:49.403 --> 36:51.312
You help them. Be discreet.

36:51.315 --> 36:52.904
All right, I don't want anyone to know

36:52.906 --> 36:54.306
that I let them come back here.

36:58.412 --> 37:00.312
Why Hope?

37:01.427 --> 37:04.762
Huh? Why choose a kid that's
probably 1,000 miles away?

37:04.765 --> 37:07.018
'Cause she's a special witch;
she's from a special bloodline.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.194
She's powerful.

37:08.197 --> 37:09.688
She was born here in the Quarter.

37:09.690 --> 37:10.855
I mean, a sacrifice like that

37:10.857 --> 37:12.377
is something that's gonna be rewarded.

37:14.194 --> 37:16.394
All right. Don't let
anything happen to her.

37:18.565 --> 37:20.131
Hey. You said you got into this

37:20.133 --> 37:21.633
for the sake of your unborn child.

37:23.737 --> 37:25.337
What happened?

37:28.475 --> 37:32.444
Well, when I found out
that Eva was responsible

37:32.446 --> 37:34.536
for taking those kids,

37:34.539 --> 37:36.581
I knew that I had to
do something about it.

37:36.583 --> 37:40.318
But she was too far gone
to answer any questions,

37:40.320 --> 37:44.456
so I got some healers and
we tried to cleanse her.

37:44.458 --> 37:47.992
I mean, I used every single
drop of power that I had.

37:57.237 --> 37:59.504
Baby.

37:59.506 --> 38:03.108
But she wasn't possessed by any demons.

38:12.786 --> 38:15.120
She had become a demon.

38:15.122 --> 38:18.289
So I don't know, I don't know
what happened to our baby.

38:19.459 --> 38:21.526
I don't know if it

38:21.528 --> 38:23.128
was the sacrificial magic.

38:23.130 --> 38:26.131
I don't know if it was
my attempts to save her.

38:27.033 --> 38:29.267
Doesn't even matter.

38:29.269 --> 38:31.636
Either way, it's my fault.

38:36.510 --> 38:39.411
I know what you're thinking.

38:39.413 --> 38:41.546
I'm the wicked witch in your story.

38:41.548 --> 38:42.981
But if I could track you down,

38:42.983 --> 38:45.150
that means plenty of
other people could, too.

38:45.152 --> 38:48.019
The only difference is,
they all want you dead.

38:48.021 --> 38:49.621
My family needs you alive,

38:49.623 --> 38:52.690
- be grateful for that.
- Oh, you want a thank you?

38:52.692 --> 38:54.559
Come closer, I'd love
to show you my gratitude.

38:54.561 --> 38:56.461
My siblings are headed
back to New Orleans,

38:56.463 --> 38:58.528
putting themselves at
risk to protect my niece.

38:58.531 --> 39:01.100
We need a cure now more
than ever, unless...

39:01.102 --> 39:03.903
Unless we destroy the disease.

39:03.905 --> 39:05.438
What are you talking about?

39:05.440 --> 39:08.808
Oh, y-you want to be free, right?

39:09.978 --> 39:12.912
Perhaps you can help
me to set us all free.

39:12.914 --> 39:17.150
You said so yourself, a monster
is just a biological organism.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.420
If you found a way to weaken yourself,

39:20.422 --> 39:22.989
maybe you can help me
to weaken someone else.

39:22.991 --> 39:24.691
My magic, your medicine.

39:24.693 --> 39:27.126
You offering me a deal?

39:27.128 --> 39:28.828
You can have your life back.

39:28.830 --> 39:30.897
But first

39:30.899 --> 39:33.967
you and I are gonna find a
way to kill Marcel Gerard.

39:40.108 --> 39:41.975
You don't need to come.

39:41.977 --> 39:44.177
You spent half a decade
as Marcel's prisoner,

39:44.179 --> 39:45.578
now let me take Hope.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.647
Hayley is distraught,
stay and comfort her.

39:47.649 --> 39:49.015
If this is indeed a trap,

39:49.017 --> 39:52.518
if Marcel is intent on killing us...

39:52.520 --> 39:55.054
your daughter needs a father.

39:55.056 --> 39:57.991
We're all going.

39:57.993 --> 40:00.727
She needs me, I need both of you.

40:02.397 --> 40:05.331
We're family, we stick together.

40:25.987 --> 40:29.322
What lives in me lives in you.

40:29.324 --> 40:31.491
Emptiness.

40:31.493 --> 40:33.092
Bitter hunger

40:33.094 --> 40:34.661
clawing at your insides.

40:37.632 --> 40:39.866
It's still there.

40:39.868 --> 40:43.269
And you'll be the one who
gives it breath.

40:45.740 --> 40:48.775
You got away because it let you.

40:48.777 --> 40:53.246
Because it needs you for later.

40:53.248 --> 40:57.483
It's still churning in
the soil of this city.

41:02.057 --> 41:04.757
It's beating in the
hearts of your people.

41:07.962 --> 41:11.331
It will be fed, and it will be set free.

41:15.036 --> 41:18.253
We will all be set free.

41:33.054 --> 41:34.587
It's okay, kids.

41:34.589 --> 41:36.022
Everything's gonna be fine.
