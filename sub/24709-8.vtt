WEBVTT

00:23.940 --> 00:25.400
CAN I HELP YOU?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.902
I'M STEVEN EGAN.
THIS IS MY WIFE SHERRIE.

00:27.986 --> 00:28.820
HOW DO YOU DO?

00:28.903 --> 00:31.072
WE THINK WE NEED TO TALK
TO A DETECTIVE.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
CAN I HELP YOU?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.616
YES. I'M STEVEN EGAN.
THIS IS MY WIFE SHERRIE.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.036
I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU NEED A DETECTIVE.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.203
OUR CHILD IS MISSING.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.955
WE WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND HE WAS GONE.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.459
HE MUST HAVE GONE OUT
AT SOME POINT
DURING THE NIGHT.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.920
WHY DON'T WE
TALK ABOUT ALL THIS
IN OUR COFFEE ROOM.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.714
THIS IS MY PARTNER
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ.

00:47.797 --> 00:48.965
HOW DO YOU DO?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.425
HOW DO YOU DO?

00:50.508 --> 00:52.093
HELLO.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.765
SOME KIND
OF REFRESHMENT?

00:56.848 --> 00:57.766
NO, THANK YOU.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.309
REFRESHMENT,
MR. EGAN?

00:59.392 --> 01:01.102
NO.

01:04.939 --> 01:08.026
HERE'S A PICTURE
OF MY SON.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.992
I'M AFRAID
THIS MAY BE MY FAULT.

01:16.076 --> 01:16.993
HOW'S THAT?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.329
NOT THAT WE HAD A FIGHT
OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.122
BRIAN AND I ARE
REALLY CLOSE.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.457
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU
BE SAYING

01:22.540 --> 01:23.958
THAT YOU THINK IT
MIGHT BE YOUR FAULT?

01:24.042 --> 01:26.711
I THINK THIS IS PART OF ME
TAKING HIM TO THE PARK,

01:26.795 --> 01:28.129
THAT HE MADE
A FRIEND THERE,

01:28.213 --> 01:31.091
AND NOW HE'S GOT SOME NAIVE
PETER PAN-ISH IDEA

01:31.174 --> 01:32.133
ABOUT TAKING CARE
OF THIS GUY.

01:32.217 --> 01:35.595
AND THAT'S WHERE
HE MAY HAVE GONE.

01:35.678 --> 01:37.305
HOW OLD IS BRIAN?

01:37.388 --> 01:38.556
HE'S JUST 8.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.934
WHAT PARK ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

01:41.017 --> 01:43.353
TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.024
I WANTED BRIAN
TO BE ABLE
TO TRUST PEOPLE.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.859
I THINK I'VE GOT
THIS FADDISH

01:49.943 --> 01:53.321
"UNDERSTAND EVERYONE
AND TEACH YOUR KID
TO UNDERSTAND EVERYONE

01:53.404 --> 01:55.240
AND SEE THE OTHER GUY'S
POINT OF VIEW..."

01:55.323 --> 01:58.159
WHAT DOES THIS ALL
HAVE TO DO WITH
TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.036
HE BEFRIENDED THIS
STRANGE HOMELESS GUY,

02:00.120 --> 02:03.123
AND INSTEAD OF SAYING, "BRIAN,
HE'S A PERFECTLY NICE GUY,

02:03.206 --> 02:05.291
"AND I'M SURE THERE'S A REASON
WHY HE IS THE WAY HE IS,

02:05.375 --> 02:08.419
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH YOUR BEING WITH HIM,"

02:08.503 --> 02:10.130
I SAY, "GREAT," YOU KNOW?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.340
"IT'S GREAT YOU'VE GOT
A NEW FRIEND."

02:12.423 --> 02:15.301
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF
IF SOMETHING'S HAPPENED.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.846
WE DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING'S HAPPENED.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.264
ALL THIS CONCERN,

02:19.347 --> 02:21.975
I EXPECT THAT YOU'VE
LOOKED FOR HIM
IN THE PARK.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.101
BELIEVE ME, WE HAVE
SCOURED THE PARK.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.645
CAN YOU GIVE US
A DESCRIPTION
OF THIS GUY?

02:25.728 --> 02:27.188
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.690
YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM AT ALL?

02:28.773 --> 02:30.525
I'M TELLING YOU,
THIS IS MY FAULT.

02:30.608 --> 02:31.693
WHY DON'T YOU STOP
SAYING IT'S YOUR FAULT

02:31.776 --> 02:34.362
AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS
MY PARTNER'S ASKING YOU.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.282
SIR, CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THIS GUY FOR US?

02:37.615 --> 02:41.202
I CAN GIVE YOU A PHOTOGRAPH
OF BOTH OF THEM.

02:41.286 --> 02:45.623
I DON'T THINK HE'S
A DRUG USER OR A DRINKER.

02:45.707 --> 02:46.875
IF I'D SENSED THAT,

02:46.958 --> 02:48.042
EVEN I WOULD HAVE
DRAWN THE LINE

02:48.126 --> 02:50.211
AT BRIAN'S HAVING
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.129
YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

02:51.212 --> 02:55.550
I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT.
I'M SORRY. ISRAEL.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.555
I JUST FEEL LIKE
EVERY SECOND BRIAN
IS NOT BEING LOOKED FOR

03:00.638 --> 03:02.348
IS WASTED TIME.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.684
HAS BRIAN EVER
RUN AWAY BEFORE?

03:04.767 --> 03:05.852
Mr. Egan: NEVER.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.353
AND NEITHER OF YOU
FEEL LIKE HE'S BEEN
UNHAPPY RECENTLY.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.689
MAYBE HE'S
JUST ACTING OUT
TO GET YOU WORRIED.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.732
HONEY?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.193
I DON'T FEEL
HE'S BEEN UNHAPPY.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.944
I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.820
RIGHT.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.281
ORDINARILY THERE'S
A 24-HOUR WAIT,

03:18.364 --> 03:19.532
BUT, UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

03:19.616 --> 03:22.243
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND
CONTACT MISSING PERSONS.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.245
AND YOU'LL START LOOKING
FOR THIS ISRAEL?

03:24.329 --> 03:25.914
YEAH,

03:25.997 --> 03:28.416
WE'LL DO THAT.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.210
CAN YOU PLEASE
GIVE ME A MINUTE?

03:30.293 --> 03:33.504
SURE. ALL THE TIME
YOU NEED.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.428
THE GUY
TALKS TOO MUCH,

03:40.511 --> 03:42.180
AND HE DON'T
TALK ABOUT
THE RIGHT THINGS.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.391
THEIR KID'S
STILL MISSING, ANDY.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.646
D.O.A. BY THE WILLIAMSBURG
BRIDGE.

03:49.729 --> 03:50.438
HOW OLD?

03:50.521 --> 03:53.358
20-YEAR-OLD FEMALE.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.570
I THINK ME AND ANDY
GOT ONE HERE, BOSS.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.447
Mr. Egan: THANK YOU.

04:02.575 --> 04:06.120
HOMICIDE BY
WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE.

04:06.871 --> 04:10.792
YOU DON'T GIVE THAT PRICK
A CHANCE BEING INVOLVED?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.753
I GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

05:50.099 --> 05:51.184
Man: OFFICER.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.061
THEY FOUND HESTER MURDERED.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.020
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

05:54.103 --> 05:54.979
HERSCHEL ROSENBLATT.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.565
IT'S LOOKS LIKE SHE'S
BEEN RAPED, ALSO.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.733
MY POOR SISTER.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.819
ALL RIGHT. GIVE US
A MINUTE, HERSCHEL.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.034
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
FOUND HER THIS MORNING.

06:08.117 --> 06:08.993
WHO TOLD THE HASIDS?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.620
THE BROTHER HADN'T
HEARD FROM HER
FOR 3 DAYS.

06:10.703 --> 06:11.704
I GUESS THEY WERE OUT
LOOKING FOR HER

06:11.788 --> 06:14.332
AND HEARD
WE FOUND HER BODY
OVER THE POLICE MONITOR.

06:14.415 --> 06:15.458
BIG GIRL.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.877
YEAH. HE SAID SHE WAS
REAL SELF-CONSCIOUS
ABOUT THAT.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.670
SHE WALKED THIS BRIDGE
EVERY DAY FOR EXERCISE.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.005
DEFENSIVE CUTS
ON THE ARMS.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.757
SHE DIDN'T GO DOWN EASY.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.925
LOOKS LIKE
A HALF-ASSED TRY

06:24.008 --> 06:25.301
AT SETTING
THE BODY ON FIRE.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.345
Uniform: YOU SAW THE BOTTLE.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.013
YEAH. YOU DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S REAL,

06:29.097 --> 06:32.266
OR THEM TRYING TO SELL
THE SEX ASPECT.

06:32.350 --> 06:35.603
Herschel:
THIS IS MY FATHER.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.525
ALL THE PICTURES.
ALL THE TOUCHING.

06:40.608 --> 06:41.859
WE'RE SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.027
WE CAN'T JUST
CLAIM HER BODY?

06:43.111 --> 06:45.780
OUR RELIGION ORDERS
PROMPT BURIAL.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.115
NO, WE CAN'T
PERMIT THAT JUST YET.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.283
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER HAS
TO LOOK OVER THE BODY.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.868
IT'S A REQUIRED PROCEDURE.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.163
I'VE DONE READING
ON YOUR BRANCH
OF JUDAISM

06:54.247 --> 06:55.206
CONNECTED WITH
ANOTHER CASE.

06:55.289 --> 06:58.000
I'LL ABSOLUTELY
REQUEST AN AUTOPSY

06:58.084 --> 06:59.377
WITH MINIMAL INTRUSION
ON HESTER

06:59.460 --> 07:01.170
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT
THE CORONER NEEDS TO DO.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.881
LET'S GET YOU IN A CAR
AND GET YOU A RIDE HOME.

07:03.965 --> 07:04.757
THANK YOU.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.384
COME WITH ME, SIR.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.052
DON'T TOUCH THEM,
DIANE.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.095
I WASN'T
GOING TO, GREG.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.930
I KNOW THEY DON'T
LIKE STRANGE WOMEN
TOUCHING THEM.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.390
I, UH, READ UP ON THEM

07:12.473 --> 07:17.103
WHEN ANDY AND I WERE
WORKING THIS TORAH CASE.

07:17.186 --> 07:23.985
UH, THE HASIDIM HAVE
SOME VERY INTERESTING
WRINKLES TO THEIR SECT.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.696
YOU DON'T WANT ME
DIPPING TOO DEEP

07:26.779 --> 07:28.239
INTO MY STRANGE
INFORMATION FUND, HUH?

07:28.322 --> 07:31.075
IT JUST DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THIS HOMICIDE

07:31.159 --> 07:32.326
HAD A BIG RELIGIOUS
ASPECT.

07:32.410 --> 07:37.248
NO, NO. THIS DON'T LOOK
FAITH-RELATED.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.380
SORRY.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.716
HEY. SOMETIMES
I BORE MYSELF.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.069
IT'S THE HOMELESS GUY

08:07.153 --> 08:09.071
THE MISSING KID'S FATHER
WAS TALKING TO US ABOUT.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.407
HASN'T SAID A WORD TO US
SINCE WE PICKED HIM UP.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.243
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT'S ABOUT?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.328
DON'T SEEM LIKE AN ACT,

08:15.411 --> 08:18.873
BUT YOU'D THINK THE FATHER
WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.251
I DON'T KNOW.

08:23.044 --> 08:27.048
YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT NOTHING TO DRINK?

08:29.383 --> 08:32.178
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU?

08:32.261 --> 08:35.056
SHOW ME WHAT I ASKED YOU.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.728
CAN YOU WRITE, ISRAEL?

08:43.397 --> 08:45.733
WRITE YOUR NAME
DOWN HERE.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.701
"ISRAEL."

08:55.785 --> 08:57.745
DID YOU PRINT THAT,
OR DID SOMEONE ELSE?

08:58.579 --> 09:00.831
HE'S ASKING YOU,
CAN YOU PRINT?

09:00.915 --> 09:02.166
IF YOU CAN PRINT,
PRINT SOMETHING.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.168
ALL RIGHT. TAKE IT EASY.
NO ONE'S GONNA HIT YOU.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.836
WE JUST WANNA KNOW
IF YOU CAN WRITE,

09:05.920 --> 09:08.756
IF YOU CAN ANSWER
OUR QUESTIONS.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.928
YOU WANT YOUR BOOK?

09:14.011 --> 09:16.305
I THINK HE HAD A BIBLE.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.477
THIS?

09:24.772 --> 09:25.731
WHAT?

09:25.815 --> 09:29.277
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S
THIS SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.322
"IT STOOD UPON 12 OXEN,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
"3 LOOKING
TOWARD THE NORTH

09:34.907 --> 09:37.034
"AND 3 LOOKING
TOWARD THE WEST

09:37.118 --> 09:38.953
"AND 3 LOOKING
TOWARD THE SOUTH

09:39.036 --> 09:40.162
"AND 3 LOOKING
TOWARD THE EAST.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.998
"AND THE SEA WAS
SET ABOVE UPON THEM,

09:42.081 --> 09:46.127
AND ALL THEIR HINDER PARTS
WERE INWARD."

09:46.669 --> 09:48.754
THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANTED US TO LOOK AT?

09:48.838 --> 09:49.922
THAT DON'T MEAN NOTHING.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.049
THIS IS ABOUT OXEN.
THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANTED US TO READ?

09:52.133 --> 09:53.175
HEY!

09:53.259 --> 09:54.552
A KID IS MISSING
NAMED BRIAN.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.762
DO YOU KNOW WHO
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.264
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE BRIAN IS?

09:58.347 --> 10:00.099
BUT YOU KNOW WHO
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.517
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.437
BRIAN'S A LITTLE BOY.
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
HE IS, ISRAEL?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.106
WHEN'D YOU SEE HIM LAST?
DID YOU SEE HIM TODAY?

10:07.189 --> 10:08.691
YESTERDAY?

10:08.774 --> 10:10.901
WHAT, 3 DAYS AGO?
YOU SAW HIM 3 DAYS AGO.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.362
WHO WAS HE WITH?

10:14.113 --> 10:15.114
WAS HE WITH HIS MOTHER
OR HIS FATHER?

10:15.197 --> 10:18.117
ONE FOR THE MOTHER.
2 FOR THE FATHER.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.495
HOW ABOUT YESTERDAY--
HIS MOTHER OR HIS FATHER?

10:25.207 --> 10:28.210
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM
YESTERDAY.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.048
ISRAEL, IS BRIAN ALIVE?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.524
I DON'T THINK
HE'S ACTING.

10:50.608 --> 10:53.736
OH, HE'S HALF WACKY,
BUT YOU GET KIND OF
A HARMLESS HIT.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.862
WHICH I DON'T THINK
HE'S ACTING.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.697
Bobby: WHAT WAS THAT
WITH THE BIBLE?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.074
NOTHING. I THINK IT'S LIKE
A SECURITY BLANKET.

10:58.157 --> 11:02.078
THIS GUY, HE POINTED
TO SOME MESSAGE
IN HIS BIBLE ABOUT OXEN,

11:02.161 --> 11:03.871
BUT NEITHER OF US FELT
LIKE IT MEANT ANYTHING.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.248
DO YOU THINK
HE'S INVOLVED
WITH THE KID?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.833
HE KNOWS THE KID.
HE SAID SO.

11:07.917 --> 11:08.626
SO HE'S NOT A MUTE.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.710
I MEAN HE INDICATED
HE KNOWS HIM.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.253
YEAH. HE HASN'T
SPOKE YET.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.422
AND WE DON'T THINK
THAT'S AN ACT?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.632
HE MAY BE ABLE
TO SPEAK,

11:14.715 --> 11:16.884
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
HE'S HIDING ANYTHING
BY NOT SPEAKING.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.845
YEAH. HE'S TRYING
TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.806
LIEUTENANT.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.184
FANCY.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.895
HE DIDN'T GRAB
THIS KID?

11:27.978 --> 11:31.315
I DON'T THINK HE DID.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.866
BODY OF
AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.952
OH, GOD. OH, GOD!

11:43.035 --> 11:45.162
I DON'T WANNA
WORK THIS.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.497
I SEEN TOO MUCH
OF THIS NOW.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.791
EVERYBODY ELSE IS WORKING
THE OTHER HOMICIDE?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.501
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

11:50.584 --> 11:52.002
I CAN TAKE SOMEBODY
OFF THE OTHER.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.212
I JUST HAD
A MOMENTARY FEELING.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.381
WHAT IS THIS,
A KANGAROO COURT?

11:55.464 --> 11:56.632

AND THEY THINK
HE HAD BEEN VIOLATED
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.706
NO SEMEN.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.207
WHEN THE PARENTS
GET HERE,

24:19.291 --> 24:22.711
YOU MAKE A SHOW
OUT OF DROPPING ME
FROM THE INVESTIGATION.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.629
YOU'RE
TELLING THE FATHER
WHATEVER I WAS THINKING,

24:24.713 --> 24:27.340
HIM MAYBE BEING
INVOLVED, BOBBY DIDN'T
FEEL THAT WAY,

24:27.424 --> 24:29.217
AND HIS POINT OF VIEW
WINS OUT.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.760
DON'T OVERSELL IT
WITH HIM.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.471
YOU KNOW HOW
TO DO IT.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.638
I TIPPED THE GUY
I LIKED HIM.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.349
YOU DON'T KNOW
IF YOU DID THAT OR NOT.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.309
WE KNOW.

24:37.392 --> 24:40.604
ANYWAY...MAYBE DIANE
SPLITS THE MOTHER OFF.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.901
DETECTIVES.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.779
FOLKS, THANKS
FOR COMING BACK IN.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.156
DANIEL DAVIS.
I'M REPRESENTING
THE EGANS.

24:51.239 --> 24:54.659
HOW DO YOU DO, SIR?
THIS IS MY BOSS
LIEUTENANT FANCY.

24:54.743 --> 24:55.577
HOW DO YOU DO?

24:55.660 --> 24:56.786
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.705
WE'RE GRATEFUL
YOU'RE CONTINUING
TO HELP US.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.664
THE EGANS
HAVE SOME IDEAS

24:59.748 --> 25:01.875
ABOUT FOLLOWING UP
ON THIS HOMELESS MAN

25:01.958 --> 25:02.918
THAT THEY FEEL
IS INVOLVED.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.295
WE'LL BRING YOU
UP TO SPEED ON THAT,
AND, UH,

25:05.378 --> 25:08.256
THIS IS DETECTIVE RUSSELL.
SHE'LL BE TALKING
WITH YOU NOW

25:08.340 --> 25:11.134
ALONG WITH, UM,
DETECTIVE SIMONE.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.052
MR. AND MRS. EGAN.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.803
DIANE RUSSELL.
HOW DO YOU DO?

25:13.887 --> 25:16.598
WHY DON'T WE GO
IN THE COFFEE ROOM.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.058
HOW YOU HOLDING UP?

25:18.141 --> 25:21.478
FINE. THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

25:22.103 --> 25:25.023
Russell: MAY I KNOW
YOUR FIRST NAME?

25:25.106 --> 25:26.024
SHERRIE.

25:26.107 --> 25:28.360
SHERRIE,
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT BRIAN.

25:28.443 --> 25:32.239
ANYWHERE YOU LIKE, FOLKS.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.617
DON'T YOU WANT
TO TALK TO US

25:35.700 --> 25:37.702
IN THAT ROOM
WITH THE CELL?

25:37.786 --> 25:39.621
WELL, MR. EGAN,
YOU KNOW, EVERY DETECTIVE

25:39.704 --> 25:41.831
HAS HIS OWN WAY
OF CONDUCTING
AN INVESTIGATION.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.876
UH, I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS 100% APPROPRIATE

25:44.960 --> 25:47.796
TO TALK WITH
YOU AND YOUR WIFE
IN THERE TO BEGIN WITH.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.715
SO I GATHER DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
IS NO LONGER IN CHARGE.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.927
I'M SURE THAT YOU'RE AWARE
IT'S BEEN, UH,
VERY DIFFICULT

25:54.010 --> 25:56.054
TO TRY AND COMMUNICATE
WITH THIS ISRAEL.

25:56.137 --> 25:59.015
BUT WE HAVE
ESTABLISHED A RAPPORT.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.058
HAVE YOU CONFRONTED HIM?

26:00.141 --> 26:02.227
NO, WE HAVEN'T
CONFRONTED HIM AS OF YET.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.854
WE'RE HOPING TO SAVE THAT
FOR SOMETHING, UH,
MORE PRODUCTIVE.

26:04.938 --> 26:08.066
BUT WE'RE BEGINNING
TO GET BACK
SOME OF THE RESULTS

26:08.149 --> 26:09.192
FROM THE LAB TESTS.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.235
WHAT DO THOSE SHOW?

26:10.318 --> 26:12.237
NO SURPRISES THERE, SIR.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.739
BEATING
AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.408
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE HOPING TO GET

26:16.491 --> 26:18.368
SOME MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS
FROM YOU

26:18.451 --> 26:19.786
SO THAT WE CAN
GO AT THIS ISRAEL WITH.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.580
HAS HE INDICATED TO YOU
WHERE HE SLEEPS?

26:21.663 --> 26:24.124
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY THROW THEM OUT
OF THE PARK AT NIGHT.

26:24.207 --> 26:27.335
YEAH, WELL,
WE PICKED HIM UP
IN THE PARK,

26:27.419 --> 26:29.087
AND HE HAD
HIS POSSESSIONS WITH HIM.

26:29.170 --> 26:32.299
IT SEEMS TO ME
BRIAN AND I
ONCE WALKED WITH HIM

26:32.382 --> 26:35.427
PAST A RESIDENCE
A BLOCK OR SO FROM...

26:35.510 --> 26:36.803
WHERE YOU FOUND BRIAN--

26:36.886 --> 26:37.887
AN UNOCCUPIED BUILDING--

26:37.971 --> 26:41.474
AND HE SEEMED TO INDICATE
HE SOMETIMES SLEPT THERE.

26:41.558 --> 26:46.021
DO YOU REMEMBER ME
MENTIONING THAT TO YOU,
SWEETHEART?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.940
YOU KNOW,
THAT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.567
EVEN IF WE DON'T
FIND ANYTHING THERE,

26:50.650 --> 26:53.445
ONE MIGHT TELL THE SUSPECT
THAT YOU DID FIND SOMETHING

26:53.528 --> 26:56.489
AND MAKING HIM THINK
THAT YOU HAVE EVIDENCE

26:56.573 --> 26:58.700
THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE HIM
TO...TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED.

26:58.783 --> 27:00.910
BEFORE YOU TRY DECEPTION,
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK

27:00.994 --> 27:03.747
AND SEE IF YOU DO FIND
SOMETHING THERE?

27:03.830 --> 27:04.748
ABSOLUTELY.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.208
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US
WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

27:07.292 --> 27:09.419
AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
WHAT WE'LL DO FIRST.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.130
MAYBE YOU AND I, SHERRIE,
COULD USE THAT TIME TO, UM,

27:12.213 --> 27:15.800
TALK ABOUT OTHER
ACQUAINTANCES BRIAN HAD--
JUST COVERING ALL THE BASES.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.552
DO YOU MIND
DOING THAT, HONEY?

27:17.677 --> 27:18.553
NO.

27:18.845 --> 27:22.641
DANIEL CAN STAY WITH YOU.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.977
GOOD.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.239
YOU SEE WHERE I MEAN,
RIGHT?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.449
THE PLACE
ON THE CORNER.

27:39.532 --> 27:40.700
Lupe:
THE TRAVEL AGENT'S PLACE.

27:40.784 --> 27:41.910
YOU THINK WE'RE DEAF,
LUPE?

27:41.993 --> 27:43.244
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GONNA TELL US?

27:43.328 --> 27:45.997
I SWEAR HE'S COMIN'.
I AIN'T TRYIN'
TO SCREW WITH YOU.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.415
WELL, IF HE
DON'T COME SOON,

27:47.499 --> 27:49.751
YOUR DEAL'S GONNA
TAKE A LITTLE TRIP.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.586
THERE HE GOES.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.546
THERE HE GOES.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.465
THERE HE GOES.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.508
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

27:56.591 --> 27:58.677
I'M MAKING HIM SHOW UP.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.473
THERE.

28:03.807 --> 28:04.808
Medavoy:
THAT'S VICTOR?

28:04.891 --> 28:07.394
YOU SAW HIM BEFORE
YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES, RIGHT?

28:07.477 --> 28:08.895
HELL IF I DID!

28:08.978 --> 28:11.314
WHAT'S SHE DOIN'
WITH HIM?

28:11.398 --> 28:12.023
Medavoy: WHO?

28:12.107 --> 28:13.900
WHO'S THE GIRL
WITH VICTOR?

28:13.983 --> 28:14.901
Lupe: THAT'S INEZ.

28:14.984 --> 28:16.403
Martinez: NOW, DON'T GET
OUT, LUPE. STAY HERE.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.487
HE'S SUPPOSED TO
KEEP AWAY FROM HER!

28:17.570 --> 28:20.949
LUPE, YOU STAY IN THIS CAR
UNTIL WE HAVE VICTOR.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.414
LET'S GO!
HEY! WHAT'D I DO?

28:27.497 --> 28:29.541
JUST RELAX. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
AT THE STATION HOUSE.

28:29.624 --> 28:31.334
VICTOR, WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING?

28:31.418 --> 28:32.419
OH, MY GOD, LUPE.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.754
I'M GONNA KICK
YOUR ASS, INEZ!

28:34.838 --> 28:36.005
AND VICTOR'S, TOO!

28:36.089 --> 28:36.965
OH, COME ON!

28:37.048 --> 28:38.550
NO, WE RAN
INTO EACH OTHER
ON COINCIDENCE.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.386
OH, AND THAT WAS
A COINCIDENTAL KISS
YOU GAVE HER, TOO, RIGHT?

28:41.469 --> 28:42.429
Martinez:
IN THE CAR, LUPE!

28:42.512 --> 28:45.849
Lupe: YOU GOT A LOT OF
EXPLAINING TO DO, VICTOR!

29:11.541 --> 29:13.126
I THINK IT'S THIS ONE.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.879
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

29:30.101 --> 29:33.313
DEFINITELY
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
WAS LIVING HERE.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.565
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING
SIGNIFICANT?

29:35.648 --> 29:39.569
YOU SAID THERE WAS
ANOTHER PLACE, TOO?

29:40.653 --> 29:42.572
WHAT'S THAT?

30:02.258 --> 30:04.719
ARE THOSE BLOODSTAINS?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.138
YEAH.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.516
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.821
TO SOME EXTENT,
MAYBE WE'RE WASTING
A LITTLE TIME

30:22.904 --> 30:25.406
ASKING MRS. EGAN
ABOUT OTHER SUSPECTS
LIKE THIS.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.826
ASKING MRS. EGAN
ABOUT OTHER POSSIBILITIES,

30:27.909 --> 30:28.910
EVEN IF ONLY
TO RULE THEM OUT,

30:28.993 --> 30:31.788
MAKES THE POSSIBILITIES
WE DON'T RULE OUT STRONGER,

30:31.871 --> 30:35.208
BUT I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY.

30:38.336 --> 30:43.007
I LOST A FAMILY MEMBER
TO AN ACT OF VIOLENCE, TOO.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.259
REALLY?

30:44.342 --> 30:46.094
MY DAD.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.346
IT WAS JUST DEVASTATING.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.931
I'M SORRY.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.767
WELL, I-I'VE HAD TIME.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.604
IF BRIAN HAS TO BE GONE,

30:56.688 --> 31:00.608
I WISH YOU'D HAD AT LAST
THE LITTLE BIT OF HEALING
TIME GIVES.

31:00.692 --> 31:05.321
NOTHING'S GOING
TO HEAL THIS.
IT'S TOO TERRIBLE.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.949
WE'RE NOT MADE
TO BURY OUR CHILDREN.

31:08.032 --> 31:08.700
OH!

31:08.783 --> 31:12.370
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

31:13.496 --> 31:15.623
I CAN'T LIVE
THROUGH THIS.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.333
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
SHERRIE.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.460
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.461
[QUIET SOBBING]

31:20.545 --> 31:22.547
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.592
THIS SICK BASTARD, SHER.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.553
HE HAD A PIECE
OF BRI'S CLOTHING.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.680
I DON'T CARE,
I DON'T CARE.

31:30.763 --> 31:33.892
I JUST WANT
BRIAN BACK.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.396
I CARE.

31:39.230 --> 31:42.400
EXCUSE ME
JUST A SECOND.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.959
THIS GUY'S A MONSTER.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.004
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

32:04.756 --> 32:06.591
THIS GUY IS
A MONSTER, BOSS.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.343
HE LEADS ME
TO THE KID'S SHIRT.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.304
I HOLD OFF SHOWING
THAT I SEE IT
FOR A SECOND

32:11.387 --> 32:12.722
SO I CAN CHECK OUT
HIS PLAY,

32:12.805 --> 32:13.681
HE CAN'T HOLD BACK.

32:13.765 --> 32:15.725
HE CAN'T WAIT FOR ME
TO BRING CRIME SCENE
OVER

32:15.808 --> 32:16.935
SO THAT THEY
CAN FIND IT.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.646
NO, HE'S GOTTA
BRING MY HAND TO IT,
TO HIS OWN KID'S BLOOD!

32:19.729 --> 32:21.481
NO WAY IT'S NOT A PLANT?

32:21.564 --> 32:22.523
NONE. NO WAY.

32:22.607 --> 32:23.566
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
YOU CAN MISTAKE
THE BUILDINGS.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.401
HE FAKES GOING INTO
THE WRONG BUILDING.

32:25.485 --> 32:29.822
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS
GOING FOR WHEN WE'RE
WALKING OUT THE CAR.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.991
I WANT THIS GUY,
BOSS.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.327
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET HIM?

32:34.994 --> 32:37.580
I GOT HER TO OPEN UP
A LITTLE.

32:37.664 --> 32:38.539
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET HIM?

32:38.623 --> 32:40.083
BRING THAT ISRAEL DOWN.

32:40.166 --> 32:45.046
MAKE THAT PRICK THINK
HE'S OFF THE HOT SEAT.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.781
DO YOU USUALLY CHANGE
YOUR MIND SO OFTEN

33:11.864 --> 33:14.617
ABOUT HOW TO CONDUCT
AN INVESTIGATION?

33:14.867 --> 33:16.077
SIR...

33:16.869 --> 33:20.915
WHAT YOU WEREN'T ALONE
IN FEELING MAY HAVE
BEEN INAPPROPRIATE

33:20.999 --> 33:26.087
IN DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ'S
DEALING WITH A GRIEVING
FAMILY MEMBER

33:26.170 --> 33:30.633
CAN BE AN ASSET
IN TALKING WITH A SUSPECT.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.471
LET ME HAVE THAT.

33:37.515 --> 33:39.726
WHAT IS THIS, ISRAEL, HUH?

33:39.809 --> 33:41.769
THIS IS BRIAN'S SHIRT
WITH BLOOD ON IT.

33:41.853 --> 33:46.024
DON'T YOU BE MAKIN'
NO GOO-GOO EYES LIKE YOU
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON!

33:46.107 --> 33:49.027
THAT'S BRIAN'S BLOOD
ON THAT SHIRT,

33:49.110 --> 33:50.820
AND WE FOUND IT
WHERE YOU SLEEP.

33:50.903 --> 33:52.822
NOW, EITHER YOU
START LETTING US
KNOW THE TRUTH HERE,

33:52.905 --> 33:56.701
OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A BIG PROBLEM WITH ME,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

33:56.784 --> 33:58.494
DO YOU UNDERSTAND,
ISRAEL?!

33:58.578 --> 33:59.328
[CRYING]

33:59.412 --> 34:00.121
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE

34:00.204 --> 34:01.706
NECESSARILY NEED
TO BE HERE, STEVE.

34:01.789 --> 34:02.790
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.709
I NEED TO GET
A SODA.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.837
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
WANT ONE?

34:07.920 --> 34:11.049
HE'S DEAD!
BRIAN'S DEAD, ISRAEL!

34:11.132 --> 34:12.717
[CRYING]

34:12.800 --> 34:14.177
ALL RIGHT,
ISRAEL.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.720
LOOK, WE GOTTA
STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.722
WE GOTTA STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT.

34:17.805 --> 34:18.681
[QUIET SOBBING]

34:18.765 --> 34:19.849
NOBODY'S SAYING THAT
YOU WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN.

34:19.932 --> 34:24.020
SO THIS WOULD BE
WHAT THEY CALL
HARD COP/SOFT COP?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.772
YES, YOU...

34:25.855 --> 34:27.440
COULD DESCRIBE IT
THAT WAY.

34:27.523 --> 34:31.277
I KIND OF THINK
THAT YOU REALLY
LIKED BRIAN.

34:31.736 --> 34:32.361
YOU DID.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.323
BUT BRIAN'S DEAD,
ISRAEL.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.282
HE'S DEAD.

34:36.365 --> 34:39.827
SOMEBODY KILLED HIM,
MIGHT NOT HAVE
WANTED TO,

34:39.911 --> 34:42.663
BUT HE LOST
HIS SELF-CONTROL.

34:42.747 --> 34:44.749
HE LOST
HIS SELF-CONTROL,

34:44.832 --> 34:46.417
AND JUST FOR
ONE MINUTE MAYBE,

34:46.501 --> 34:50.338
HE COULDN'T CONTROL
HIS EMOTIONS.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.216
NOW IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU CAN HELP BRIAN'S
MOM AND DAD

34:53.299 --> 34:55.718
GET SOME PEACE OF MIND
OVER THIS?

34:55.802 --> 34:57.595
STOP WASTIN' TIME!
YOU TREAT HIM DECENT,

34:57.678 --> 34:59.680
HE DON'T GIVE YOU
NO COOPERATION.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.599
THE DECENT PART'S OVER.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.975
BELIEVE ME...

35:03.059 --> 35:04.936
I'VE DEALT WITH GUYS
BIGGER THAN YOU,

35:05.019 --> 35:07.647
AND IT'S ALWAYS ME
THAT LEAVES WALKIN'.

35:07.730 --> 35:08.940
NOW...

35:09.023 --> 35:10.399
ME AND DETECTIVE SIMONE

35:10.483 --> 35:12.902
ARE GONNA GIVE YOU
A FEW MINUTES
TO THINK ABOUT THIS,

35:12.985 --> 35:15.029
AND THEN WE'RE
GONNA COME BACK,
AND WHEN WE DO,

35:15.113 --> 35:16.614
WE'RE GONNA ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS

35:16.697 --> 35:19.117
THAT YOU CAN NOD YOUR HEAD
TO "YES" OR "NO."

35:19.200 --> 35:22.745
AND I BETTER BE SATISFIED
THAT I'M GETTIN'
THE RIGHT KIND OF NODS,

35:22.829 --> 35:29.252
OR AFTERWARDS YOU'RE GONNA
BE LUCKY YOU CAN MOVE
YOUR HEAD AT ALL.

35:31.754 --> 35:35.216
I SEE WHAT YOU WERE
TALKING ABOUT...

35:36.092 --> 35:37.802
HIM BEING AN ASSET.

35:37.885 --> 35:38.678
YES, UM...

35:38.761 --> 35:43.891
DETECTIVE SIPOWICZ
IS A PIECE OF WORK.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.399
LUPE SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HER PART IN IT?

35:51.482 --> 35:54.902
PRETTY MUCH
PINNED IT ALL
ON YOU, VICTOR.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.070
THAT BITCH.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.029
SHE TOOK PART, MAN.

35:57.113 --> 36:00.241
SHE COVERED UP
THE--THE FAT GIRL'S MURDER.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.325
HEY!

36:01.409 --> 36:03.411
THE FAT GIRL
HAD A NAME...

36:03.494 --> 36:04.579
AND A FAMILY

36:04.662 --> 36:06.998
AND A WHOLE COMMUNITY
THAT'S GRIEVING
FOR HER RIGHT NOW.

36:07.081 --> 36:11.669
YOU, UH, YOU TAKE THAT
INTO ACCOUNT. MAYBE YOU
DO YOURSELF SOME GOOD.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.921
LUPE'S LOSING HER LOOKS.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.215
THAT'S WHY SHE'S
HATING INEZ SO MUCH.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.594
THESE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED
BECAUSE OF JUNK--

36:19.677 --> 36:21.762
JUNK THAT LUPE'S ON
SAME AS ME, MAN!

36:21.846 --> 36:25.266
IF I WAS CLEAN,
I WOULD'VE NEVER DONE IT!

36:26.434 --> 36:29.270
Martinez:
TELL US ALL
ABOUT IT.

36:30.688 --> 36:32.940
I'M TELLING LUPE'S PART, TOO.

36:33.024 --> 36:33.691
DEFINITELY.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.651
DON'T LEAVE
THAT OUT.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.948
THE WAY TO COLLAR EGAN
IS THROUGH HIS WIFE.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.075
IT MAY NOT BE CONSCIOUS,
BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.952
WE GOTTA BUY TIME
TO LET THAT WORK ON HER.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.204
CANDIDLY,
AS A PROSECUTOR,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.456
I WOULD SALIVATE OVER
GOING TO BAT AGAINST
THE HOMELESS MUTE.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.334
HAVE YOU LISTENED
TO A DAMN WORD
ANYBODY'S SAID?

36:51.417 --> 36:52.418
I LISTENED TO WHAT
EVERYONE SAID,

36:52.501 --> 36:54.462
AND I CREDIT YOUR
SUSPICIONS AGAINST
THIS GUY EGAN.

36:54.545 --> 36:55.463
I'M SAYING,
IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE,

36:55.546 --> 36:57.506
YOU COULD PRESENT
AGAINST THE MUTE TODAY,

36:57.590 --> 36:58.549
AND A GRAND JURY
WOULD INDICT.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.968
HE'S A CLEVER MAN.
THAT'S HOW THIS GUY
SET IT UP.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.304
WONDERS WHY PEOPLE
CALL HIM ASSHOLE.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.347
QUIET, ANDY.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.473
YOU WANT MY MORAL REACTION
TO THIS GUY, DETECTIVE,

37:05.556 --> 37:07.099
WE CAN HAVE A SEPARATE
CONVERSATION.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.143
YEAH, I'LL SEE CAN I
CHANGE MY DINNER PLANS.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.479
IS THERE AN ARGUMENT
THE BEST WAY TO REASSURE
THE HUSBAND

37:11.562 --> 37:12.855
IS TO GO AHEAD AND
ARREST THE HOMELESS GUY?

37:12.939 --> 37:14.982
YEAH. YOU'LL SHUT
THE CASE DOWN.

37:15.066 --> 37:15.983
WHAT'S THAT GONNA
DO TO ISRAEL?

37:16.067 --> 37:17.735
SOUNDS LIKE HE'S
SLEPT IN WORSE PLACES

37:17.818 --> 37:18.527
THAN JAIL.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.821
ACCUSE HIM
OF THIS KID'S MURDER,

37:20.905 --> 37:22.114
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
HIS HEART.

37:22.198 --> 37:24.492
IF WE HAVE TO
PUT HIM THROUGH
SOME TEMPORARY CHANGES

37:24.575 --> 37:26.744
TO GET THE FATHER
LOCKED UP, ANDY,

37:26.827 --> 37:28.829
THAT'S HOW IT HAS TO BE.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.915
THIS EGAN IS RICH,
AND HE'S GOT A GOOD LAWYER.

37:30.998 --> 37:35.419
YOU REALLY THINK ARRESTING
THIS ISRAEL'S GONNA GET
THIS GUY CHARGED?

37:36.754 --> 37:37.797
HOLD ISRAEL.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.548
COOL THE HUSBAND OUT,
SAYING THAT WE LIKE
THIS ISRAEL,

37:39.632 --> 37:42.927
BUT WE CAN'T CHARGE HIM JUST
YET BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD
HAVE TO GET HIM COUNSEL.

37:43.010 --> 37:45.263
THAT'LL GET YOU SOME TIME
WITH THE WIFE EXPLAINING IT.

37:45.346 --> 37:49.058
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT WITH
THE HUSBAND AND THE LAWYER
IN LEFT FIELD.

37:49.141 --> 37:52.270
WHO TELLS THIS ISRAEL
HE CAN'T LEAVE?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.406
THERE'S WORD,
DETECTIVE?

38:03.489 --> 38:04.365
WE ARRESTED THE MAN

38:04.448 --> 38:06.075
WHO KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER,
MR. ROSENBLATT,

38:06.158 --> 38:08.995
AND, UH, WE GOT
A CONFESSION FROM HIM.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.079
I SEE.

38:10.162 --> 38:13.666
YOU CAN REST EASY HE WON'T
BE ON THE STREET ANYMORE.

38:13.749 --> 38:14.959
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

38:15.042 --> 38:17.420
WE WERE ABLE TO GET
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

38:17.503 --> 38:18.796
TO RELEASE
YOUR DAUGHTER'S REMAINS

38:18.879 --> 38:20.589
WITHOUT AN INVASIVE
AUTOPSY.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.675
YOU CAN GET HESTER
IN THE MORNING.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.635
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO YOU.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.180
MY, UH, OUTSIDER'S
UNDERSTANDING OF
HASIDIC LAW, UH...

38:28.264 --> 38:33.352
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
OF HESTER'S REMAINS
IS TO BE COLLECTED?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.313
IF HER BLOOD
WAS SPILT, YES.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.314
THIS IS, UH...

38:36.397 --> 38:40.568
SOIL AND SUCH
FROM THE AREA
WHERE HESTER DIED.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.829
I THANK YOU FOR THIS.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.664
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.334
WE'RE SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.263
NO ONE ELSE IN THE SQUAD
WOULD'VE KNOWN TO DO THAT,
GREG.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.140
THANKS.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.661
WHAT I SAID--
HOW I WAS GONNA HURT YOU--

39:32.745 --> 39:35.873
DON'T BE AFRAID ABOUT THAT.
YOU HEAR ME, ISRAEL?

39:42.838 --> 39:45.216
[CLEARING THROAT]

39:45.800 --> 39:47.510
YOU GOTTA STAY.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.887
WE'LL, UH, WE'LL BRING YOU
FOOD TO EAT,

39:49.970 --> 39:51.680
THERE'S A LAVATORY
DOWN THE HALL,

39:51.764 --> 39:54.642
AND YOU'LL SLEEP
ON THE COT HERE.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.769
YOU LIKE THE RADIO?

39:56.852 --> 40:01.107
I'LL TRY AND GET A RADIO
BROUGHT UP HERE FOR YOU.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.111
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

40:05.194 --> 40:06.612
WE NEED TO KEEP YOU HERE,

40:06.695 --> 40:11.075
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU DID ANY HARM
TO THAT BOY.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.119
HMM?

40:17.748 --> 40:21.794
ANY FEELINGS
ON BRIAN'S DAD?

40:37.226 --> 40:41.272
WHAT DO WE GOT, MORE OXEN
AGAINST THE WALLS?

40:49.196 --> 40:53.409
"THE PROUD HAVE FORGED A LIE
AGAINST ME,

40:53.492 --> 40:58.747
BUT I WILL KEEP THY PRECEPTS
WITH MY WHOLE HEART."

41:02.126 --> 41:04.086
GIVE ME ANOTHER MESSAGE.

41:13.304 --> 41:14.430
[CLEARING THROAT]

41:14.513 --> 41:17.766
"AND SHE CALLED UNTO
HER HUSBAND AND SAID,

41:17.850 --> 41:19.351
<i>"SEND ME, I PRAY THEE,</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:24.106
<i>ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN</i>
<i>AND ONE OF THE ASSES."</i>

41:27.151 --> 41:28.068
"AND HE SAID,

41:28.152 --> 41:31.906
<i>"WHEREFORE WILT THOU</i>
<i>GO TO HIM TODAY?</i>

41:31.989 --> 41:36.243
<i>IT IS NEITHER NEW MOON</i>
<i>NOR SABBATH."</i>

41:36.702 --> 41:40.623
"THEN SHE SADDLED AN ASS
AND SAID TO HER SERVANT,

41:40.706 --> 41:42.458
<i>"DRIVE AND GO FORWARD,</i>

41:42.541 --> 41:46.545
<i>SLACK NOT THY RIDING</i>
<i>FOR ME."</i>

41:49.715 --> 41:52.468
FOR A MINUTE THERE,
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ON TO SOMETHING

41:52.551 --> 41:56.180
WITH THE PROUD LIES
AND PRECEPTS.

41:58.015 --> 42:01.435
ALL RIGHT. SOMEBODY'LL
BE UP HERE WITH YOUR FOOD.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.021
TRY AND GET SOME REST.

42:28.212 --> 42:30.839
HOW'D HE TAKE
TO BEING HELD?

42:30.923 --> 42:32.758
SHOWED ME SOME
RELEVANT SCRIPTURE,

42:32.841 --> 42:34.885
GO FORTH ON AN ASS.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.763
I SEE THE MOTHER
10:00 TOMORROW.

42:37.846 --> 42:41.308
DOES SHE TRY LETTING
HER KNOW WE DON'T
LIKE THIS ISRAEL?

42:41.392 --> 42:42.935
BACKING IT HOW, ANDY?

42:43.018 --> 42:45.312
RIGHT NOW THE EVIDENCE
POINTS HIM OUT.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.065
LOOK, ON THE OTHER SIDE,
ALL WE GOT NOW

42:48.148 --> 42:51.277
IS THE KID BEING
CHRONICALLY RAPED
ON AN AUTOPSY,

42:51.360 --> 42:53.279
WHICH THE HUSBAND
IS GONNA HAVE

42:53.362 --> 42:56.073
5 DIFFERENT DOCTORS
THAT'S GONNA ARGUE
THE OTHER WAY.

42:56.156 --> 42:57.324
SO LET'S JUST STAND ME
UP AGAINST A WALL

42:57.408 --> 42:59.243
AND PUT A BULLET
IN MY HEAD FOR
SUGGESTING AN APPROACH.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.912
NO, LET'S JUST SAY THAT I
DISAGREE WITH YOUR SUGGESTION

43:01.996 --> 43:04.164
AND NOT TRY TO TURN THIS
INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.457
GOD FORBID YOU EVER
MADE A MISTAKE.

43:05.541 --> 43:09.461
YOU KNOW, ANDY, SOMETIMES,
YOU ARE HIGH-MAINTENANCE
LIKE A BROAD.

43:09.545 --> 43:13.424
WHOA, OH, THIS IS REALLY
HELPING <i>ME </i>THINK STRAIGHT.

43:13.507 --> 43:15.718
[SIGHS IN ANGRY FRUSTRATION]

43:16.760 --> 43:19.930
YOU FEEL BAD,
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU.

43:21.098 --> 43:24.560
I GOTTA FIND A BIBLE.

43:29.231 --> 43:34.194
SHE KNOWS HE DID IT,
AND HE KNOWS SHE DOES.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.363
DON'T WAIT ON HIM
TELLING YOU.

43:36.447 --> 43:39.033
IT'S WAITING FOR HER
BEHIND A DOOR.

43:39.116 --> 43:42.328
HE'S TRYING TO GET HER
TO STAY AWAY FROM THE DOOR

43:42.411 --> 43:45.456
SO THE THING BEHIND IT DIES.

43:45.789 --> 43:48.208
AND THE THING
FRIGHTENS HER SO MUCH,

43:48.292 --> 43:50.419
SHE'S LETTING HIM DO IT.

43:51.086 --> 43:53.631
HOW DO YOU GET HER BRAVE?

43:54.465 --> 43:57.509
SHE'S GOTTA FEEL THE THING
WAITING FOR HER,

43:57.593 --> 44:00.429
NEEDING HER TO LIVE.

44:01.347 --> 44:04.642
BRIAN'S DEAD,
BUT THIS IS STILL ALIVE.

BRIAN'S BLOOD...

THE DOOR TO SAVE IT.
