01:46.914 --> 01:49.215
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:49.282 --> 01:51.350
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:54.887 --> 01:57.188
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:57.256 --> 01:59.523
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

02:01.927 --> 02:05.929
<i>Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas!</i>

02:05.997 --> 02:08.014
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

02:08.082 --> 02:12.252
<i>Merry Christmas!
Ha ha, ho ho!</i>

02:13.112 --> 02:15.252
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

02:17.383 --> 02:18.977
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

02:19.396 --> 02:21.052
<i>And a merry Christmas to you.</i>

02:21.258 --> 02:22.796
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

02:35.977 --> 02:37.077
Oh, boy.

02:43.508 --> 02:46.563
Shit. He's got kids.

02:46.752 --> 02:49.352
Dog, cat... shit.

02:49.730 --> 02:52.471
That's no good.
It's no good.

03:05.164 --> 03:07.103
I-I-I-I-I...

03:18.101 --> 03:20.389
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

03:21.007 --> 03:24.414
It has been two weeks
since my last confession.

03:25.051 --> 03:26.464
Is that Bill Firpo?

03:27.651 --> 03:29.184
Uh, yes, It's me, father.

03:29.976 --> 03:32.376
It's been five years since
you've been to confession.

03:32.432 --> 03:34.432
Is that how you're gonna
start the whole thing out?

03:34.676 --> 03:37.556
- I'm sorry, father.
- It's okay.

03:38.114 --> 03:39.038
Father...

03:40.470 --> 03:42.114
I found a wallet in the street.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.970
Did you do the right thing?

03:45.164 --> 03:45.973
Well...

03:46.264 --> 03:49.234
yes, father, I did, eventually,

03:49.451 --> 03:52.119
with great... difficulty.

03:52.395 --> 03:54.151
I dropped it in the mail.

03:54.782 --> 03:56.595
But it had over $800 in it,

03:56.701 --> 03:59.201
which I counted many times
on the subway,

04:00.232 --> 04:02.978
and I feel as if I've ruined
my karma, father,

04:03.232 --> 04:07.839
and that something bad is gonna happen
as a result of this transgression.

04:08.276 --> 04:10.114
How many letters is that?

04:11.245 --> 04:12.539
Transgression?

04:14.626 --> 04:15.648
I don't know.

04:17.139 --> 04:18.401
13. Why, father?

04:18.914 --> 04:20.220
Never mind.

04:20.845 --> 04:22.348
Did you mail the wallet back?

04:22.454 --> 04:24.870
Yes. I realized that, uh...

04:25.489 --> 04:28.332
I'm really not that much different
than my two brothers...

04:30.620 --> 04:32.614
I can easily be led astray.

04:33.282 --> 04:36.057
Speaking of which, have you seen
tonight's paper?

04:36.346 --> 04:37.551
No. Why?

04:37.621 --> 04:40.376
Well, according to the post,
they may be home for the holidays.

04:41.545 --> 04:43.589
No, that's not possible.

04:43.776 --> 04:45.382
They're not up for parole until march.

04:45.501 --> 04:48.507
According to this article,
because of overcrowding,

04:48.664 --> 04:51.707
anyone who's eligible
for parole through June...

04:51.826 --> 04:54.014
is being considered
for an early release.

05:07.845 --> 05:09.520
I'm in big trouble now.

05:09.639 --> 05:10.706
The pterodactyl.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.876
It was a lizard
back in prehistoric times...

05:14.101 --> 05:16.870
who developed an outside
digit of the forelimb...

05:16.970 --> 05:18.854
which became greatly elongated...

05:19.003 --> 05:22.080
in order to support a winged membrane.

05:22.397 --> 05:24.787
Now! He used this membrane...

05:24.899 --> 05:27.280
to fly high above his predators,

05:27.443 --> 05:28.910
which you gotta remember,

05:28.998 --> 05:31.511
was way back in the cretaceous period.

05:31.743 --> 05:34.912
And as far as periods go,
oh, it was a mother.

05:37.762 --> 05:40.080
- Mr. Firpo!
- Yes?

05:40.855 --> 05:42.387
Where's all this going?

05:43.605 --> 05:46.099
Oh. Uh... well, uh...

05:46.324 --> 05:48.918
Eh, skipping, skipping, skipping, eh...

05:49.405 --> 05:50.587
What I, uh,..

05:50.874 --> 05:54.698
I believe... is that once
released from this prison,

05:54.924 --> 05:56.998
I, much like my reptilian brother,

05:57.379 --> 05:58.833
shall take wing...

05:58.940 --> 06:01.025
and fly high above my problems...

06:04.949 --> 06:06.899
Never to return!

06:11.543 --> 06:15.130
- That's it.
- That was very moving, Mr. Firpo.

06:16.462 --> 06:18.992
But the prison psychiatry board

06:19.035 --> 06:21.374
says you're incapable
of telling the truth.

06:21.912 --> 06:23.074
Well, that's a lie.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.231
Alvin Firpo.

06:32.706 --> 06:35.738
You have been labeled a kleptomaniac.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.344
Alvin!

06:42.612 --> 06:46.669
- Are you all right, Mr. Firpo?
- Okay. How you guys doin'?

06:47.506 --> 06:49.306
My name's Alvin Firpo.

06:49.780 --> 06:50.650
And, uh...

06:51.062 --> 06:52.648
what I've learned in prison is that, like,

06:52.730 --> 06:55.068
robbin' and stealin'
and all that horseshit...

06:55.404 --> 06:57.535
There's somethin' that ain't right
about it. You know what I mean?

06:57.567 --> 07:00.025
A lot of guys in here
disagree with me, but...

07:00.151 --> 07:01.307
they're servin' time,

07:01.568 --> 07:02.481
I'm up for parole.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.544
Connect the dots.
Connect 'em.

07:06.007 --> 07:07.970
So long, fellas.
So long!

07:09.213 --> 07:09.926
Yeah!

07:11.207 --> 07:13.123
- Fresh air!
- Yes, sir.

07:15.820 --> 07:16.920
- So long, Jerry.
- Bye, boys.

07:16.977 --> 07:17.988
So long, Jerry.

07:18.913 --> 07:19.882
- Take it easy.
- Smiley.

07:19.926 --> 07:21.876
- Yeah, right.
- Smiley, I'm gonna miss ya.

07:21.967 --> 07:24.207
You want to do me a favor?
Get yourself something nice.

07:24.208 --> 07:24.959
- Thank you.
- All right.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.857
- Enjoy it, Smiley.
- You stay out of trouble.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.235
- Hey, Bill! How are ya?
- All right. All right.

07:29.292 --> 07:31.355
Let's start this off on the right foot.

07:31.528 --> 07:33.739
Whatever it is, the answer's no.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.901
"No"? "No" wha?..
What are you talking about?

07:37.184 --> 07:39.878
Whatever it is that you want me to do,
the answer's no.

07:40.128 --> 07:42.653
- Does that apply to me too, Bill?
- No. I got no beef with you.

07:42.699 --> 07:43.755
- You sure?
- Yes.

07:43.819 --> 07:45.417
'Cause I wouldn't want
you to be pissed at me.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.329
- No. You're fine.
- Really? There's no problem between us?

07:48.423 --> 07:49.479
There's startin' to be.

07:49.842 --> 07:53.180
- Well, it's nice to see you too.
- All right. Let's go see ma.

07:54.949 --> 07:55.691
Hey, Alvin.

07:56.003 --> 07:57.922
I heard the economy was in the shithouse.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.386
I had no idea.
Look at that abandoned car.

08:01.455 --> 08:03.211
- It's my car.
- What the...

08:03.274 --> 08:05.900
- Oh. Sorry.
- It's, uh... it's nice.

08:07.747 --> 08:08.911
You gotta be kiddin'!

08:11.091 --> 08:13.674
Boy, I bet the space shuttle
makes less noise.

08:14.316 --> 08:17.322
Hey, Alvin. I never seen
stalactites in a car before.

08:17.391 --> 08:19.041
Stalactites!

08:20.109 --> 08:22.153
I can see nothing's changed.

08:23.553 --> 08:25.783
Yeah, nothin's changed, huh, Dave?

08:29.516 --> 08:31.584
- Alvin, we're free.
- That's right. Free as a bird.

08:31.618 --> 08:34.359
Hey, Bill, you think this crate could
make it to Pennsylvania, do you?

08:34.395 --> 08:37.572
'Cos I got this friend in prison.
He's practically on his deathbed, you know.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.315
He asked me to do him this favor and...

08:39.371 --> 08:41.433
Well, he gave me a letter
explaining everything.

08:41.467 --> 08:43.518
Here.
You gotta read this.

08:44.673 --> 08:46.165
It'll make you cry.

08:51.016 --> 08:52.716
I detect resistance.

08:54.278 --> 08:56.141
Well, I knew you'd react like that.

08:56.278 --> 08:58.940
That's why I got another copy
for your future perusal.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.260
You two are on parole.

09:00.372 --> 09:02.679
You cannot leave the state.
You are in my custody.

09:02.735 --> 09:03.599
You cannot go.

09:03.654 --> 09:07.516
So just quiet down, my
little one, and call me dad.

09:08.479 --> 09:09.385
Hey, dad.

09:10.054 --> 09:12.510
Can we stop and get some, uh,
ring dings and milk?

09:12.535 --> 09:14.047
- Ring dings and milk?
- Ring dings and milk!

09:14.054 --> 09:18.016
Oh, yeah! Then we can get some balloons,
and we can go to the puppet show.

09:18.097 --> 09:21.929
- What are you, two years old?
- Oh, well pardonez-moi.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.679
We're not all fancy, upscale
restaurateurs like you, Bill.

09:25.741 --> 09:29.072
Fine, fine. Then we'll get some ring dings
and milk for the child in the back.

09:30.034 --> 09:31.040
Yummy, yummy.

09:45.200 --> 09:46.260
Shit!

09:51.354 --> 09:52.523
Idiot!

09:58.573 --> 09:59.967
- Come here!
- Look it! Hey!

10:00.948 --> 10:01.742
What's the problem?

10:01.792 --> 10:05.267
Come on, I... what are you... no...

10:05.410 --> 10:09.173
No, no! It's all right!
Put the money back!

10:22.684 --> 10:25.590
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

10:27.574 --> 10:29.328
¡Policia! ¡Policia!

10:32.756 --> 10:35.140
Get your hand out of your pocket!

10:37.468 --> 10:38.496
Son of a bitch!

10:38.540 --> 10:41.013
I'm not with you five minutes,
and I'm being chased by cops!

10:51.716 --> 10:54.160
Come here!
Up against the wall!

10:54.554 --> 10:56.628
Come here!
Come on! Come on!

10:56.846 --> 10:59.154
Get up against the wall!
Get up against the wall!

11:00.941 --> 11:03.475
- Come on!
- Freeze, goddamn it! I'll shoot!

11:03.973 --> 11:06.010
Sergeant Dickman, off duty, Queens!

11:06.223 --> 11:08.104
- What is your name, rookie?
- Birdie.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.066
I got the mayor up my ass
on account of punks like you!

11:11.323 --> 11:14.810
So stop jackin' off, get the car
and pick up this scum!

11:15.020 --> 11:15.520
Okay.

11:15.547 --> 11:17.091
- Move!
- Yes, sir!

11:26.880 --> 11:27.774
You know, Bill,..

11:28.161 --> 11:30.267
there are 8 billion stories
in the naked city.

11:30.336 --> 11:32.386
Not all of them revolve around you.

11:32.486 --> 11:34.533
Come on. Don't hold back, ma.
That's cream corn.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.904
Look at that stuff. One more.
Come on. That's delicious.

11:37.149 --> 11:38.705
Can't beat it with a stick.
Thank you.

11:38.868 --> 11:39.555
Yeah, warm me up.

11:39.605 --> 11:41.698
It's great to be home, ma,
I gotta tell you.

11:42.587 --> 11:45.718
- I miss this little piece of heaven.
- Yeah. I missed you, ma.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.505
I missed you boys too.

11:49.392 --> 11:51.575
You know what else I miss around here?

11:51.849 --> 11:54.042
I miss all the creature comforts
we used to have

11:54.111 --> 11:55.755
when you boys were around...

11:56.286 --> 11:59.311
VCRs, big-screen TVs.

11:59.361 --> 12:00.933
- You remember?
- Yeah.

12:01.536 --> 12:03.824
Boy, you could hardly move in here.

12:05.149 --> 12:08.611
Hardly move!
Big-screen TV!

12:08.686 --> 12:12.009
Yeah, I wonder who misses them
more - you or the original owners.

12:12.076 --> 12:13.499
Aw, baloney.

12:14.161 --> 12:15.899
Are you sayin' that stuff was stolen?

12:15.986 --> 12:19.374
No, Ma. Dave and Alvin would never
steal anything. They're saints.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.780
That car wash robbed itself.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.642
We were at the park all day.

12:23.705 --> 12:27.036
They didn't have a shred of evidence,
'cept for our fingerprints.

12:29.223 --> 12:30.391
What's this?

12:32.961 --> 12:35.411
You don't wanna read that, ma.
That's a real heartbreaker.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.567
Yeah, ma. That's wicked bad.

12:38.605 --> 12:43.674
"Dear Dave and Alvin. It's been five years
since I've seen my daughter.

12:44.436 --> 12:48.074
"As I told you before,
she refuses to visit me here.

12:48.674 --> 12:50.049
"I'm gettin' old,..

12:50.205 --> 12:53.917
"and I can't stand the thought
of another Christmas...

12:56.394 --> 12:58.795
"going by without seeing her.

12:59.961 --> 13:01.817
"Her name is Sarah,

13:02.417 --> 13:05.911
"and she's the only thing in the world
that means anything...

13:07.355 --> 13:08.399
"to me.

13:08.999 --> 13:10.399
"I know I'm askin' a lot,

13:10.462 --> 13:14.581
"but I would like for you to look her up
in that town I mentioned to you,

13:15.524 --> 13:17.832
"Paradise, Pennsylvania,

13:18.549 --> 13:21.501
"and beg her to come see me.

13:26.605 --> 13:30.809
"I know bein' on parole, you're
not supposed to leave the state.

13:31.142 --> 13:35.280
"but you two bastards owe me for
all the shit I've done for you,

13:35.394 --> 13:40.105
"and if you don't do it, I promise
I will somehow escape from this place,

13:41.267 --> 13:43.336
"track you down like dogs,

13:43.899 --> 13:47.686
"rip off your heads
and shit down your throats.

13:48.930 --> 13:51.642
"All my love this holiday season,

13:51.811 --> 13:54.192
Vic Mazzucci."

13:55.186 --> 13:57.447
Bravo.
Oh, come on!

13:57.515 --> 13:59.186
I gotta get out of this loony bin.

14:00.011 --> 14:02.355
How can you ignore a man like this?

14:02.761 --> 14:06.717
Ma, I'm sure he's the nicest killer on
"C" block, but I really got to get to work.

14:08.836 --> 14:10.324
Look, has anybody seen my wallet?

14:10.692 --> 14:12.755
If your head wasn't screwed on...

14:12.974 --> 14:14.717
Fine. I'm leaving.

14:15.442 --> 14:16.411
Good evening.

14:16.536 --> 14:19.187
May I assist you with
your specials tonight?

14:19.811 --> 14:23.036
- Yes, waiter.
- Actually, I'm the, uh, the manager.

14:23.692 --> 14:25.754
- What exactly is in the bouillabaisse?
- I'll call you back.

14:25.836 --> 14:27.492
Well, it's a variety of things, actually.

14:27.623 --> 14:31.326
It's a splendid array of fish,
shellfish, garlic, paprika...

14:31.955 --> 14:34.336
Hey! Is my brother doin' a great job?

14:34.449 --> 14:36.199
Oh, we're very proud of him.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.817
Would you please, uh... would you
please excuse me for a moment?

14:41.692 --> 14:43.717
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to save your life!

14:43.769 --> 14:45.112
You gotta get out of here.
This is where I work.

14:45.156 --> 14:46.587
- Yeah, but...
- This is where I work.

14:46.649 --> 14:48.849
Do not come down here
and screw things up, okay?

14:48.969 --> 14:50.423
Whatever it is, we'll
talk about it at home.

14:50.446 --> 14:52.655
You don't understand.
You can't go home!..

14:53.974 --> 14:55.949
Holy shit!
They're here already.

14:57.152 --> 14:59.689
Well, Bill, we gotta give these cops
one thing - they're efficient.

14:59.727 --> 15:01.783
- What are you talking about?
- Your wallet!

15:02.812 --> 15:05.802
You dropped your wallet at the scene
of the crime in the Bronx.

15:05.858 --> 15:06.979
The cops were at the house.

15:07.010 --> 15:08.822
- They're askin' ma questions.
- Cops... Did ma...

15:08.872 --> 15:11.491
That's right! I'm here to rescue you.
Just calm down!

15:11.691 --> 15:13.019
Me and Alvin borrowed a car.

15:13.057 --> 15:13.803
- Okay.
- Let's go.

15:15.288 --> 15:17.482
Hey! Come on! Let's go!

15:17.715 --> 15:20.483
- Come on! Run!
- Hurry up!

15:20.552 --> 15:22.853
Let's get outta here!

15:22.921 --> 15:25.549
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

15:38.631 --> 15:40.650
What's going on at the house?
Yeah.

15:42.937 --> 15:44.954
What?
You're kiddin'!

15:46.400 --> 15:49.619
Oh, no. You think we should stay
out of New York altogether?

15:49.637 --> 15:51.275
Ma, it's Christmas Eve, and we're...

15:52.262 --> 15:54.206
Yeah, well, we're in New Jersey now.

15:55.144 --> 15:56.637
That's not far enough away?

15:57.200 --> 16:00.143
Yeah, but, ma, we want to come home.
It's Chri...

16:00.600 --> 16:01.541
Yeah, but we...

16:03.931 --> 16:04.799
All right.

16:05.487 --> 16:07.081
All right.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

16:07.556 --> 16:09.876
Yeah. I love you too.
All right.

16:12.869 --> 16:14.062
Here, Bill.
I got you this.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.006
Something to read.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.794
Take your mind off of things.

16:20.619 --> 16:23.670
Can I play some...
Hm?

16:24.162 --> 16:25.481
Listen, I got more bad news.

16:25.669 --> 16:28.662
Ma says the cops are at the house.
They're just drivin' her nuts.

16:28.746 --> 16:31.656
Maybe we can go to Pennsylvania,

16:31.731 --> 16:34.600
and Alvin and I could do that favor
for our friend and his daughter.

16:34.650 --> 16:36.640
What I'd like to do...

16:39.500 --> 16:41.002
is go back home.

16:41.237 --> 16:42.262
You know, Bill,..

16:42.762 --> 16:44.506
maybe if we did something
for somebody else,

16:44.556 --> 16:47.324
it'd have a way of coming
back around for us.

16:49.387 --> 16:50.824
You set me up.

16:51.168 --> 16:53.105
- What?
- Is this, uh...

16:53.299 --> 16:55.694
Is this one of your elaborate schemes?

16:56.618 --> 16:57.758
Oh, no! Come on.

16:57.801 --> 16:59.743
- Now, would I do that to you?
- Dave...

17:01.664 --> 17:03.383
I know how your mind works.

17:04.638 --> 17:07.401
You know exactly what you're doin'...

17:08.170 --> 17:09.805
and the whole time...

17:10.055 --> 17:12.023
you stand there...

17:12.795 --> 17:14.601
with this "Who, me?"...

17:15.050 --> 17:16.723
expression...

17:17.090 --> 17:19.258
on your face!

17:22.362 --> 17:23.656
You're doing it right now.

17:26.106 --> 17:28.725
All right. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.496
Alvin, is it me?

17:34.194 --> 17:35.331
Move!

17:59.694 --> 18:00.992
Look, guys...

18:02.331 --> 18:04.750
I'm a sport. I'm here.
You know, and so...

18:06.062 --> 18:07.150
Do me a favor...

18:07.356 --> 18:09.731
Let's try to keep this as inconspicuous,

18:09.768 --> 18:11.287
- ...as possible.
- Oh, absolutely.

18:26.779 --> 18:27.995
Timmy!

18:30.758 --> 18:32.289
Merlin, are you okay?

18:33.289 --> 18:36.900
- Easy, Merlin. Easy. Easy.
- Very nice, very nice. Another cop.

18:36.968 --> 18:40.270
All right. Let me through there.
Timmy, what happened?

18:40.314 --> 18:42.433
- I fell, dad.
- Are you hurt?

18:42.569 --> 18:45.664
I'm all right, dad.
How about Merlin?

18:45.808 --> 18:48.582
- Merlin's fine. Merlin's fine.
- Hey, I'm real sorry, you know.

18:48.651 --> 18:50.904
It's just that, uh, he rode
right out in front of us.

18:50.947 --> 18:52.464
I didn't know what to do.

18:52.577 --> 18:55.033
- Is he retarded?
- Yeah.

18:55.838 --> 18:57.164
Come here a second.

18:59.470 --> 19:00.245
Look...

19:01.726 --> 19:04.632
My boy's a little slow.
You understand?

19:04.674 --> 19:06.875
- I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
- Anybody hurt?

19:06.943 --> 19:09.211
- No. Everybody's fine, Father Gorenzel.
- Oh, good.

19:09.287 --> 19:11.249
That'd be no way
to start Christmas Eve.

19:11.387 --> 19:12.549
Heh! Right!

19:12.639 --> 19:15.924
All right. Back up, everybody.
Just go on with your business, please.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.743
There's nothing here to watch anymore.
Thanks.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.776
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.013
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, boys.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.445
Is there anything I can do to help you?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.464
I... No, I don't think so.

19:26.876 --> 19:28.289
What are you here for, the winter-fest?

19:28.347 --> 19:31.499
Yeah, that and we're looking
for a Sarah Mazzucci.

19:32.645 --> 19:33.545
Mazzucci?

19:34.001 --> 19:36.889
I don't think there's anybody by the name
of Sarah Mazzucci in this town.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.030
As a matter of fact, the
only Sarah I know is a...

19:39.118 --> 19:40.389
Sarah Collins.

19:40.801 --> 19:42.758
- She works right there.
- Where?

19:43.776 --> 19:44.870
Right there!

19:47.226 --> 19:48.633
The town bank.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.545
- Imagine that.
- Yeah. Imagine that.

19:51.696 --> 19:55.046
Well, if you get your car out of the way,
we'll get the traffic movin'.

19:55.231 --> 19:56.333
See ya later. Thank you.

19:57.808 --> 20:01.101
- Well, let's go check it out.
- He just said her name was Collins.

20:01.589 --> 20:03.189
Maybe she got married.

21:22.151 --> 21:25.339
And the sign says "take a pen,"
not "take all the pens."

21:26.214 --> 21:28.114
- Can I have 'em back?
- The pen... it said, "take"...

21:28.262 --> 21:29.526
Come on.

21:30.881 --> 21:33.545
- It said on the sign...
- All of them. All of them.

21:34.514 --> 21:37.870

21:40.620 --> 21:42.107

21:44.414 --> 21:47.270
Okay. Okay.

21:48.426 --> 21:49.635
Sarah, honey.

21:50.029 --> 21:51.279
All the pens are gone.

21:51.342 --> 21:53.167
Yeah, I know. I have them right here,
Mr. Anderson.

21:53.168 --> 21:53.900
If you say so.

21:55.849 --> 21:56.886
New customer?

22:00.461 --> 22:01.361
Sarah?

22:03.342 --> 22:05.930
- Sarah Collins?
- Yeah?

22:06.105 --> 22:07.214
Are you married?

22:08.276 --> 22:10.714
- Why? Are you gonna propose?
- Yes.

22:13.478 --> 22:14.739
Do I know you?

22:16.545 --> 22:17.812
No. I'm Bill.

22:18.420 --> 22:21.189
I apologize for my brother.
He's, uh...

22:24.114 --> 22:25.614
...mentally retarded.

22:25.898 --> 22:27.920
You know, he's a... a diabetic,

22:28.526 --> 22:31.226
and we were afraid he was
gonna go into insulin shock.

22:32.689 --> 22:34.739
I said, "Hey, why don't you go
and find yourself...

22:35.576 --> 22:37.504
something sweet?"

22:39.595 --> 22:42.020
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yes. It was nice meeting you.

22:42.051 --> 22:44.276
Nice meeting you.
Very nice, Sarah.

22:49.339 --> 22:50.864
Wrong Sarah?

22:51.149 --> 22:54.651
Well, I guess that just depends on
how you look at it, doesn't it?

22:54.958 --> 22:56.345
Yeah.

22:56.945 --> 22:57.976
Hey, Bill!

22:59.189 --> 23:01.608
Don't you just love this old,
classic architecture?

23:02.620 --> 23:03.692
Forget it.

23:04.095 --> 23:07.489
- Forget what?
- I got eyes. I know you.

23:07.695 --> 23:08.564
Forget it.

23:08.717 --> 23:12.420
One, I ain't doin' it,
no matter how good it looks.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.136
And two, there's no money in the vault.

23:26.589 --> 23:30.051
- And what have we here?
- $275,000.

23:31.139 --> 23:33.464
<i>Would you mind signing here,
Mr. Anderson?</i>

23:35.433 --> 23:36.103
You all right?

23:36.733 --> 23:37.858
<i>See you, boys.</i>

23:37.908 --> 23:39.089
Alvin, come on.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.045
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night, sir.

23:43.595 --> 23:45.220
Where the hell are we
going in such a hurry?

23:45.283 --> 23:47.413
It doesn't matter.
Just get us out of here.

23:47.664 --> 23:48.774
What's the matter?

23:49.564 --> 23:51.339
- What's the matter?
- Yeah.

23:52.551 --> 23:55.553
I'm telling you, if I had
a gun on me right now,

23:55.621 --> 23:58.722
I'd go in that bank
and take that place over.

24:01.408 --> 24:02.526
Say, Bill.

24:03.395 --> 24:07.280
Would you be terribly upset with me
if I were to tell you...

24:07.514 --> 24:10.591
that there may possibly be guns...

24:11.333 --> 24:14.658
- ...in the trunk?
- Alvin, pull the car over.

24:14.714 --> 24:15.826
- What?
- Pull it over!

24:15.855 --> 24:18.190
All right, all right, all right!
Easy!

24:27.396 --> 24:29.001
All right.
Get out of the car.

24:32.303 --> 24:33.501
Come on.

24:36.432 --> 24:37.951
- Get out.
- All right, all right.

24:40.793 --> 24:42.308
What is your problem?

24:44.126 --> 24:46.195
There's guns in the trunk,
and I got a problem?

24:46.810 --> 24:49.729
- Hey, I borrowed the car from fast Eddie.
- Who the hell is fast Eddie?

24:49.791 --> 24:53.140
Fast Eddie, the guy... he runs... he owns
the gun shop on Morris park Avenue.

24:53.273 --> 24:56.554
Oh, terrific! So chances are,
there's an arsenal back there.

24:56.818 --> 24:59.928
There's probably a couple of
shotguns and a couple .45s.

25:00.755 --> 25:03.674
But you haven't actually seen
these guns, have you, Dave.

25:04.162 --> 25:07.714
- No. No, just an assumption.
- No, we haven't seen...

25:09.418 --> 25:11.887
Oh, my God! Guns!

25:14.176 --> 25:15.937
Big surprise, huh?

25:20.208 --> 25:22.633
Which way do you think
the mouse is headed?

25:26.608 --> 25:28.547
Start with the cheese
and move backwards.

26:33.503 --> 26:34.549
You idiot!

26:34.857 --> 26:36.493
We're about to rob a bank,
and you're gonna get us

26:36.494 --> 26:39.186
- ...pinched for stealin' hats?
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

26:39.868 --> 26:40.787
What?

26:41.993 --> 26:44.304
I was... I was...

26:45.981 --> 26:48.936
- I was...
- You gotta be kidding me?

26:49.161 --> 26:50.176
What are you doing?

26:50.605 --> 26:53.217
Hmm. What?

26:53.900 --> 26:54.999
I can't even...

27:08.144 --> 27:10.896
Oh, and, uh, however much these cost.

27:19.117 --> 27:21.874
Would you quit hoverin'
'round me like bad news?

27:22.762 --> 27:25.780
- What do you want me to do?
- Bag this stuff.

27:27.386 --> 27:28.124
All of it?

27:29.117 --> 27:32.424
No. Just what you haven't become
emotionally attached to.

27:34.092 --> 27:36.973
Oh, Christ on a crooked crutch!
Get out of the way!

27:39.155 --> 27:41.624
You boys here for the winterfest?

27:42.055 --> 27:44.786
No, we're just...
we're just passin' through.

27:46.174 --> 27:47.324
Just passin' through?

27:47.824 --> 27:49.592
Just passin' through!

27:50.666 --> 27:51.366
Passin'.

28:13.430 --> 28:14.911
- What?
- Don't shut it off.

28:15.374 --> 28:17.443
We won't have time
to hot-wire it again.

28:17.519 --> 28:21.318
Bill, you do what you do,
and I do what I do.

28:22.323 --> 28:24.474
That enhances my sense of security.

28:29.757 --> 28:31.001
All right.

28:32.057 --> 28:33.863
All right.
Let's do it!

28:44.089 --> 28:48.170
All right!
This is a goddamn robbery!

28:48.232 --> 28:50.207
- Do not move!
- Get your hands up now!

28:50.609 --> 28:51.352
Do not move!

28:51.427 --> 28:53.382
- Get 'em up!
- Get away from that phone!

28:53.738 --> 28:56.626
- Get 'em up!
- Who is talking?

28:57.363 --> 28:58.807
Who is talking?

29:00.563 --> 29:01.882
Do you boys really, um...

29:02.164 --> 29:03.776
Do you boys really want to do this?

29:03.907 --> 29:05.695
- Do what?
- Wha... um...

29:08.214 --> 29:10.616
You know... rob the bank.

29:10.734 --> 29:11.828
Absolutely!

29:12.320 --> 29:15.097
We have thought this over,
and this is the thing to do!

29:15.140 --> 29:16.111
Keep 'em up!

29:16.238 --> 29:20.018
But-but on-on Christmas Eve?
I... eh-eh...

29:20.054 --> 29:22.409
It doesn't seem right, don't you think?

29:23.290 --> 29:25.571
You're going to ruin the winterfest.

29:28.284 --> 29:29.453
The winterfest?

29:29.837 --> 29:30.978
I have a gun...

29:31.384 --> 29:33.609
And you're talkin' about the winterfest?

29:34.590 --> 29:36.640
Well, who are you?

29:37.290 --> 29:40.861
- I'm married to Mr. Anderson...
- Ooh, lucky him.

29:41.115 --> 29:43.084
The president of the bank.

29:44.328 --> 29:47.878
I... eh... the bank vault
is closed right now.

29:48.628 --> 29:49.443
It's locked.

29:49.619 --> 29:51.138
It... It's locked?

29:51.569 --> 29:53.394
All right! Who's got the key?
Raise your hand!

29:53.887 --> 29:55.115
Rai...

29:56.643 --> 29:58.094
All right. Lower your hands.

29:58.684 --> 30:00.851
Who's got a key?
Raise your hand.

30:01.844 --> 30:03.107
You got... no?

30:04.151 --> 30:06.369
- All raise your hands.
- Key! Key!

30:06.626 --> 30:09.413
All right, you fashion queen.
Who's got the key?

30:09.462 --> 30:13.519
- My husband is the only one with the key.
- Ke-e-ey! Key!

30:13.575 --> 30:17.018
My husband is the only one with a key,

30:17.087 --> 30:19.274
and I'm afraid he's out
to lunch right now.

30:19.569 --> 30:22.663
- Well, when's he get back?
- Oh, about, um...

30:24.101 --> 30:26.438
- ...45 minutes.
- Okay! Nobody move!

30:27.038 --> 30:29.257
Keep your hands up!
Stay away from the phones!

30:31.572 --> 30:33.575
Forty-five minutes ain't bad.

30:34.425 --> 30:35.938
You need a lobotomy.

30:36.519 --> 30:39.663
Don't get nasty with me.
It was just a suggestion.

30:41.957 --> 30:44.161
I'm gonna get ya.
I'm comin' at ya.

30:44.484 --> 30:45.661
Mrs. Anderson.

30:51.849 --> 30:54.518
- And gotcha!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

30:54.775 --> 30:56.977
I'm coming, I'm coming...

30:58.125 --> 30:59.281
Keep 'em up!

30:59.999 --> 31:01.262
Where are you going?

31:01.543 --> 31:04.431
- I'm going with you to get the key.
- No! You stay here!

31:04.833 --> 31:06.631
Don't you two fall in love.

31:09.537 --> 31:11.315

Bank president's in there having lunch.
Let's go.

32:28.273 --> 32:29.292

<i>Has he got a friend he wants to bring?</i>

32:35.026 --> 32:38.003
Nobody move, goddamn it!
This is a robbery!

32:38.092 --> 32:41.394
It's a robbery! It's a robbery!
It's a robbery!

32:45.372 --> 32:47.572
Where are you going?

32:48.703 --> 32:51.322
It... it's a robbery.

32:51.652 --> 32:55.090
I'm going to get you money
out of the cash register.

32:55.259 --> 32:56.840
I'm robbing the bank!

32:58.746 --> 33:01.932
Well, the bank... is across the street.

33:02.765 --> 33:05.103
I know the bank is across the street.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.303
I need to get Mr. Anderson over there
to open up the vault!

33:08.915 --> 33:10.441
Could you hold this for a second?

33:10.670 --> 33:12.260
Could ya? Thank you so much.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.485
All right. That looks tasty.
A little salt never hurt.

33:15.878 --> 33:18.128
- Yum, yum.
- What are you doing?

33:18.516 --> 33:20.760
- I'm eatin' scrapple.
- Don't touch any of that!

33:20.785 --> 33:22.921
- We're gettin' out of here!
- It's got scallions.

33:23.354 --> 33:24.342
Get your hands up!

33:28.315 --> 33:31.882
Well, well. Somebody got their
Christmas bonus early, huh?

33:31.975 --> 33:33.582
What do you think he did?
Drink it?

33:34.694 --> 33:36.988
Hey, you're not gonna leave
all these people here, are ya?

33:37.082 --> 33:40.601
I mean, any one of them will call the cops
the second we're outta here.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.950
And breathe...

33:53.693 --> 33:55.552
and let it out.

33:55.841 --> 33:56.913
Good, good.

33:57.007 --> 33:59.272
It's just your basic yoga.
I learned it in prison.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.651
It's good for tense situations
like this robbery...

34:01.738 --> 34:04.169
or if you ever do go to prison,
you're surrounded by 10 men.

34:04.288 --> 34:05.069
Helps to relax you.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.612
We're just gonna take the money,
believe me. No one's gonna get hurt.

34:11.831 --> 34:12.949
We only want your cash.

34:13.023 --> 34:16.246
Move forward. Move forward.
Go in. Move forward.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.812
Everybody come in.
Keep your hands up.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.380
Anybody who moves...

34:20.550 --> 34:23.456
will get shot, as will
the person next to you.

34:23.918 --> 34:25.150
The two-for-one thing.

34:25.221 --> 34:27.565
I just got through relaxin' 'em.
You're makin' 'em all panic.

34:27.596 --> 34:28.275
You stay here!

34:28.465 --> 34:29.969
- All right. Get in.
- Open the door.

34:30.199 --> 34:31.399
Just keep your hands up.

34:31.661 --> 34:35.237
So it's ground beef-cheese-scallion
scrapple.

34:35.587 --> 34:36.757
Thanks a lot.

34:37.897 --> 34:40.706
All right. Come on. Let's go.
Keep your hands up. Move.

34:42.487 --> 34:44.063
You bring the whole town?

34:45.056 --> 34:46.275
Move forward.

34:48.393 --> 34:50.906
- Go forward. There's plenty of space.
- It's okay.

34:51.494 --> 34:52.587
- Move!
- I'm mov...

34:52.760 --> 34:55.581
Who here, this is their first robbery?
Raise your hand.

34:56.100 --> 34:59.312
- Back off!
- Yeah, you? First one?

34:59.612 --> 35:02.271
Come on! Back off.
Okay. Back away. Back away!

35:02.327 --> 35:03.268
All right, now.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.408
This is just a robbery.
No one will get hurt.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.283
For those of you just joining us,
keep your hands up.

35:08.441 --> 35:10.452
We were doing a little yoga earlier.

35:10.796 --> 35:14.043
I see there's some people still shaking.
Let's breathe in.

35:14.455 --> 35:15.418
It's gonna be all right.

35:15.444 --> 35:17.005
<i>- And out.</i>
- Just stay out of their way.

35:19.707 --> 35:22.021
Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
Raise your hand.

35:23.396 --> 35:24.939
Huh! Tough!

35:25.502 --> 35:27.302
We'll be done here very shortly.

35:28.365 --> 35:32.671
This is something you will be able to
take home with you after this robbery...

35:33.058 --> 35:36.346
a little exercise, which it looks like
some of you could use. All right?

35:36.400 --> 35:38.802
So, let's breathe in.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.140
Breath in. Good. Hold it.
And let it out.

35:42.752 --> 35:43.383
Good.

35:43.508 --> 35:45.445
And one more deep breath in.

35:45.996 --> 35:49.483
Everybody.
And let it out. Good.

35:50.289 --> 35:51.564
What the hell did you do?

35:52.158 --> 35:54.225
Shit!
All right, back away!

35:54.492 --> 35:56.240
Everyone, keep your hands up!

36:04.693 --> 36:07.542
I'm Alvin Firpo,.. officer.

36:07.635 --> 36:09.247
I was just here...

36:09.387 --> 36:12.049
waiting to see when the meter ran out.

36:17.101 --> 36:18.327
Where's he goin'?

36:26.423 --> 36:29.266
Aw, g'wan, ya sons of bitches!

36:29.426 --> 36:31.529
You want a piece of this?
Come on!

36:32.379 --> 36:35.885
- Come on. Come on.
- Kiss my ass.

36:36.247 --> 36:37.210
Damn!

36:37.815 --> 36:40.016
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!

36:41.649 --> 36:43.969
<i>- Holy skunk!
- What?</i>

36:44.213 --> 36:45.713
<i>- Yeah, you!
- Go!</i>

36:49.339 --> 36:52.508
Hey!
Alvin!

36:54.381 --> 36:56.715
Is he gonna do it again?
Is he gonna do it again?

37:00.566 --> 37:03.490
Well, didn't go out of your way, did ya?

37:03.522 --> 37:05.096
You're here, ain't ya?

37:56.959 --> 37:58.003
What's that?

37:59.143 --> 38:02.049
Oh, shit. I still got the keys
to the vault on me.

38:06.506 --> 38:07.859
Same time next year.

38:13.520 --> 38:14.332
Hey, Mazzucci.

38:14.682 --> 38:16.245
Tell us about that bank you broke into.

38:16.295 --> 38:20.276
- I'm tired of tellin' that story.
- Aw, Victor, come on.

38:20.338 --> 38:22.432
- All right, all right.
- Tell it nice and slow.

38:22.488 --> 38:23.507
Okay.

38:24.282 --> 38:26.919
This bank...
is like a beautiful orchard.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.243
Only instead of fruit, there's
money ripening on the vine.

38:30.306 --> 38:33.362
- It's just waiting to be picked.
- I love the way he tells this story.

38:33.888 --> 38:37.425
No camera, and the security guard,
he's older than water.

38:37.921 --> 38:41.265
- Oh, this can't be true!
- Vic, what are we doin' in this joint?

38:42.801 --> 38:44.737
Ain't you worried about talkin' here?

38:45.053 --> 38:47.145
What if somebody beat ya to the punch?

38:47.213 --> 38:49.652
Are you crazy?
Who's gonna double-cross him?

38:50.103 --> 38:52.465
He's buried more people than forest lawn!

38:55.838 --> 38:56.632
Hey Vic!

38:57.288 --> 38:59.736
You know that bank job you guys
are always talking about?

38:59.819 --> 39:01.704
- Yeah. What about it?
- Was it in Pennsylvania?

39:01.761 --> 39:02.944
- Yeah.
- Paradise?

39:03.017 --> 39:05.086
- Yeah. Why?
- It just got robbed.

39:05.211 --> 39:06.367
Came over the TV.

39:06.404 --> 39:09.160
Hey, Vic. Isn't that where
your daughter Sarah works?

39:09.263 --> 39:11.998
Do you think those Firpo brothers
had anything to do with it?

39:12.039 --> 39:13.467
Those rat bastards.

39:15.729 --> 39:16.231
Vic?

39:30.469 --> 39:32.250
Welcome to Paradise, gentlemen.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.187
Agent Peyser, sir.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.419
Right this way.

39:36.694 --> 39:38.225
I want agents at every roadblock.

39:38.293 --> 39:40.090
- I don't trust these local cops.
- Okay.

39:40.106 --> 39:42.750
And I don't care what their story is.
Everybody everywhere is a suspect.

39:42.769 --> 39:44.062
- You got it!
- Got it.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.506
- Hi. I'm chief Burnell.
- Special agent Peyser.

39:48.556 --> 39:49.580
Yeah. This is my son.

39:50.261 --> 39:51.811
- He's deputy Timmy Burnell.
- Okay. Okay.

39:51.999 --> 39:53.517
- Hi!
- Hi.

39:54.681 --> 39:56.212
Move back, please.

39:58.481 --> 40:00.494
- Move it!
- Move it.

40:02.183 --> 40:04.127
Well, the first thing I want to know,
do you think...

40:04.156 --> 40:05.939
this bank was hit by locals or outsiders?

40:06.007 --> 40:09.331
I can't really say, but we've never
had a problem like this before.

40:09.462 --> 40:11.950
I can't really believe it
would be anybody from town.

40:12.056 --> 40:13.928
Anybody suspicious around
before the bank was robbed?

40:13.959 --> 40:15.897
- Oh, well...
- Jesus Christ, Bernie.

40:15.941 --> 40:17.622
- What the hell's goin' on?
- Hi, Ed. How ya doin'?

40:17.689 --> 40:20.020
I tell ya, this town is
crawlin' with tourists.

40:20.057 --> 40:21.511
That's 'cause of our winterfest.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.611
So your guess is probably
as good as mine.

40:23.686 --> 40:25.861
But there was three guys
in town this morning.

40:26.011 --> 40:28.058
Yeah. Nearly run over my kid.

40:28.336 --> 40:32.361
- I've never seen 'em before.
- This way. Watch your step.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.199
It's right through here.

40:35.505 --> 40:38.251
- What kind of car was it?
- Ah,.. an <i>Infinity</i>.

40:38.426 --> 40:39.645
Merry Christmas, gentlemen.

40:39.783 --> 40:42.501
<i>- Merry Christmas.</i>
- The snow came down pretty hard and fast.

40:42.564 --> 40:45.533
- But hopefully they're still in the area.
- Put out an APB on that car.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.285
- I've already done that.
- Good.

40:47.311 --> 40:49.115
Well, with any luck,
we ought to be able to...

40:49.352 --> 40:50.340
find 'em,..

40:50.850 --> 40:52.488
especially if they're heading north.

40:54.751 --> 40:55.913
Alvin.

40:57.834 --> 40:58.940
What?

41:00.202 --> 41:01.702
Where are we headed?

41:05.161 --> 41:06.346
North.

41:07.802 --> 41:09.161
How do you know?

41:10.246 --> 41:12.365
I swear we passed that farmhouse before.

41:12.465 --> 41:13.295
What? Oh, no!

41:13.346 --> 41:15.752
All those farm houses, they look alike.

41:15.784 --> 41:19.190
Alvin, if we're going around in circles,
I'm gonna break your neck.

41:19.615 --> 41:22.334
I just did what the map said.
I made four lefts.

41:22.783 --> 41:25.606
Four lefts is a circle, you idiot!

41:25.952 --> 41:27.415
Are you sure?

41:29.950 --> 41:33.647
- Oh, state trooper. Oh, shit! Shit!
- All right! Relax, relax.

41:34.027 --> 41:36.402
- Don't make eye contact.
- He's turning around.

41:36.490 --> 41:40.359
We're just three guys drivin' down
the road in a blizzard. That's all.

41:40.459 --> 41:42.557
Nothin' to get nervous about.
All right?

41:48.355 --> 41:49.896
He's comin' after us.

41:52.258 --> 41:53.812
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Just relax.

41:53.837 --> 41:54.887
He's gaining on us.

41:55.894 --> 41:57.250
- Yes. What?
- I see it.

41:57.475 --> 42:00.186
- He's gaining on us.
- Who cares? Alvin, step on it!

42:00.253 --> 42:04.773
- I don't have any snow chains.
- The cop is comin' after us.

42:04.841 --> 42:06.941
Are you out of your mind?
Go!

42:08.473 --> 42:11.408
- Hurry up!
- Just be cool. Lay back.

42:51.111 --> 42:51.992
That hurt!

42:54.830 --> 42:56.280
You all right?

42:58.224 --> 42:59.852
I didn't have snow chains.

43:00.149 --> 43:04.055
- You have no brain either.
- Hey! You guys all right?

43:04.182 --> 43:05.223
Who the hell is that?

43:05.455 --> 43:07.408
You two shut up, and let me
do the talking.

43:10.230 --> 43:13.194
- Wha... What happened?
- Our car ran off the road.

43:13.269 --> 43:14.919
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

43:15.019 --> 43:17.525
Well, we're not dead,
if that's what you mean, you...

43:17.556 --> 43:19.145
Didn't have snow chains!

43:19.245 --> 43:21.480
Look, you guys are gonna freeze out here.

43:21.522 --> 43:23.242
You better get in my car fast!

43:23.311 --> 43:25.614
- Can you take us to the interstate?
- No! No!

43:25.677 --> 43:28.704
- The roads to the interstate are closed.
- Can you take us anywhere?

43:28.867 --> 43:31.034
Look, you're gonna be singing
at my aunt and uncle's pretty soon,

43:31.035 --> 43:33.246
so you may as well brush up here, okay?

- Uncle Cliff.

44:13.754 --> 44:16.584
- Oh, you okay?
- I'm sorry. I just stubbed my toe.

44:16.882 --> 44:17.723
Oh, dear.

44:17.810 --> 44:19.560
I'm sorry it took me
so long getting here.

44:19.625 --> 44:22.376
This is Bill, Dave and Alvin Firpo.

44:27.529 --> 44:28.510
Geez, Ed.

44:29.048 --> 44:31.685
Those were the guys that were
in our store, aren't they?

44:32.967 --> 44:35.617
By God, Clovis, that's
very observant of you.

44:36.898 --> 44:39.742
You know, it's a good thing
they made us deputies, Clovis.

44:40.379 --> 44:42.492
Uncle Cliff, they had an
accident up at Hastings

44:42.493 --> 44:44.629
- ...and I decided I'd bring them with me.
- Oh, dear!

44:44.667 --> 44:45.623
Well, come on in.

44:45.785 --> 44:47.323
- I hope you don't mind.
- Not at all.

44:47.385 --> 44:48.555
Come on in out of the cold.

44:48.610 --> 44:51.054
- Thank you. That's very kind.
<i>- Dick's here. He brought some guests.</i>

44:51.104 --> 44:52.385
Merry Christmas.

44:52.578 --> 44:54.292
Think he'll remember us?

44:55.542 --> 44:57.779
- Hey, can I take your bag?
- No!

45:00.198 --> 45:02.442
This is Mrs. Anderson.

45:02.973 --> 45:05.848
These guys had an accident up the road.
I decided to bring 'em over here.

45:07.869 --> 45:10.787
I remember you from the bank this morning.

45:16.410 --> 45:17.304
How do you mean?

45:19.088 --> 45:19.751
I'm sorry.

45:19.787 --> 45:22.207
I don't mean to come off
like I'm interrogating you,

45:22.470 --> 45:23.063
but...

45:23.819 --> 45:25.717
the bank was robbed this afternoon...

45:26.001 --> 45:28.757
- ...by three men.
- And on Christmas Eve?

45:29.830 --> 45:30.788
Well...

45:31.120 --> 45:32.613
what's this world coming to?!

45:33.176 --> 45:35.663
Well, of course, I saw you
talking with Sarah <i>upstairs</i>,

45:35.832 --> 45:37.488
so I knew you were all right.

45:39.976 --> 45:41.345
<i>Upstairs?</i>

45:42.132 --> 45:45.288
We call her Sarah <i>upstairs</i>.
She rents a room from us.

45:45.982 --> 45:48.007
She's been here a couple of years now.

45:50.026 --> 45:50.788
That is...

45:51.738 --> 45:52.451
terrific.

45:52.632 --> 45:54.001
These poor gentlemen.

45:54.051 --> 45:55.332
First they get run off the road,

45:55.351 --> 45:58.732
and now we're practically accusing them
of being bank robbers.

45:58.816 --> 46:01.157
I think they've had enough
excitement for one day.

46:01.209 --> 46:03.832
- Don't you?
- You got that right, Mrs. A.

46:04.153 --> 46:06.747
Oh, Mrs...
I like that!..

46:07.263 --> 46:09.535
Oh, aunt Hetty, um, I'm sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

46:09.651 --> 46:11.982
I told these gentlemen I could
get 'em a change of clothes.

46:19.776 --> 46:21.468
No, no, no.
Oh, no, er...

46:21.523 --> 46:23.693
- One for you.
- Thank you.

46:25.293 --> 46:26.832
Look, you can't do this.

46:26.894 --> 46:28.807
These are from your wife, obviously.

46:29.628 --> 46:30.615
Yes, that's right.

46:30.715 --> 46:33.571
Now I'm giving them to you.
Merry Christmas, boys.

46:34.421 --> 46:36.820
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

46:37.251 --> 46:38.913
Oh, my goodness, son.

46:39.013 --> 46:40.715
Your lip is bleeding.

46:40.887 --> 46:41.957
Oh, my God.

46:42.138 --> 46:44.538
- I must need some ointment or whatnot.
- No, he's all right!

46:44.584 --> 46:46.563
You right, do you got any...
what do you call it...

46:46.607 --> 46:48.163
- ...ointment or somethin'?
- No, he's all right.

46:48.604 --> 46:51.120
- We'll take care of him right away.
- He's all right.

46:52.444 --> 46:54.794
- Don't be long.
- I need ointment!

46:56.457 --> 46:57.138
What's in it?

46:57.776 --> 46:59.748
You'll have to open it to find out.

47:00.113 --> 47:01.345
Is it clothes?

47:03.057 --> 47:04.351
I hope they fit.

47:05.720 --> 47:08.163
- Sarah <i>upstairs</i>.
- Sarah <i>upstairs</i>.

47:08.313 --> 47:10.269
I guess I should say Sarah <i>downstairs</i>.

47:10.782 --> 47:12.069
'Cause now I'm downstairs, yeah.

47:12.113 --> 47:14.194
- When you're upstairs, you're up.
- And...

47:16.382 --> 47:17.995
So what are you doing here?

47:18.832 --> 47:20.107
It's another long and...

47:20.169 --> 47:22.258
miserable story that I'd rather
not get into right now.

47:22.307 --> 47:24.620
There's a three-legged dog
over there staring at me.

47:25.722 --> 47:28.614
That's Tripod.
We named him Tripod.

47:29.982 --> 47:33.726
He was a stray, he was hit by a truck,
and, you know, we took him in.

47:34.245 --> 47:36.058
Poor doggie.

47:37.195 --> 47:38.907
Oh, you know, you look... damp.

47:38.975 --> 47:40.013
You must be cold.

47:41.426 --> 47:44.464
- Why don't you change, or...
- Three on each side? Okay.

47:44.533 --> 47:46.946
You know, wash up a little.
Get warm.

47:47.514 --> 47:51.233
<i>With Interstate 95 being the only
major road still open.</i>

47:51.508 --> 47:54.903
<i>The storm dumped 14 inches in Chicago
before moving east.</i>

47:54.970 --> 47:58.473
<i>There have been seven deaths
attributed to the weather so far.</i>

47:58.764 --> 48:00.474
What are you watchin', Marla?

48:00.871 --> 48:02.089
Oh, just a little TV.

48:02.148 --> 48:04.267
<i>A daring prison break at Long Island
state prison in New York.</i>

48:04.389 --> 48:09.277
<i>Two inmates took advantage of what is being

48:09.546 --> 48:12.821
<i>overpowering three guards

48:38.692 --> 48:40.735
In fact, I'm feeling so good,
I'm gonna call our ma.

48:40.829 --> 48:42.554
Hey Mrs. Anderson,
can we call our mother?

48:43.392 --> 48:45.463
Certainly, dear.
It's in the hall.

48:45.729 --> 48:47.751
Okay, okay. Bill, come on.
Let's call her.

48:48.013 --> 48:49.274
I'm dying to hear from her.

48:50.613 --> 48:52.176
What the hell's the matter with you?

48:52.234 --> 48:54.900
Singing at the top of your lungs,
jumping around like Fred Astaire!

48:55.617 --> 48:57.851
I got carried away by the Christmas spirit.

48:58.462 --> 49:00.987
I'm sorry I'm not a deadbeat
like you, Bill.

49:05.294 --> 49:07.294
You are really getting paranoid.

49:10.443 --> 49:11.743
- Hello, Ma?
- Dave?

49:15.049 --> 49:16.093
If you don't give me that money,

49:16.118 --> 49:17.843
I'm gonna throw your mother
out the window!

49:17.900 --> 49:19.643
I don't think she can fly, can she?

49:19.743 --> 49:21.531
Oh, no, no, no.

49:21.562 --> 49:24.087
Flying would be out of the question,
especially in this weather.

49:24.294 --> 49:26.568
- What's the problem?
- She wants to fly down here.

49:26.631 --> 49:30.075
- Did you rob that bank?
- Ah! What an imagination!

49:30.621 --> 49:32.301
- Let me talk to her.
- Wait... wait a sec.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.627
No, no no. You know what she's like
when she gets this way.

49:34.721 --> 49:36.508
- She's mad at you.
- She's mad at me?

49:36.577 --> 49:39.584
- Yeah. Let me take care of it.
- Where are you, goddamn it?

49:39.808 --> 49:41.676
Your mother said you
went to Pennsylvania.

49:41.789 --> 49:43.867
You got snowed in, didn't
you, you dumb bastard?

49:44.010 --> 49:45.565
Don't you call me...
Now, you listen to me...

49:45.566 --> 49:46.503
- Alright.
- Wait a sec.

49:46.772 --> 49:48.795
Now, ma, now, you listen to me.

49:48.850 --> 49:51.383
Now, do us both a favor.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

49:51.464 --> 49:53.635
When the road clears, we'll come down.

49:54.641 --> 49:55.960
We're not gonna hurt her,

49:56.054 --> 49:57.560
as long as you do the right thing.

49:57.666 --> 49:59.541
All right, all right.
Love you too.

50:02.091 --> 50:05.591
- Oh, did you want to talk to her?
- Yes, I wanted to talk to her!

50:05.712 --> 50:07.701
<i>I'm takin' some cranberry sauce.
It's Christmas.</i>

50:08.131 --> 50:09.393
What did that idiot say to ya?

50:10.393 --> 50:11.218
He said he loved me.

50:12.749 --> 50:14.666
That is right.
I thought so too.

50:15.629 --> 50:17.547
She is a funny lady.
How you guys doin'?

50:17.822 --> 50:18.791
You know what?

50:18.860 --> 50:20.741
They got some kinda feast
out there, I'm tellin' ya.

50:20.779 --> 50:23.510
- Wait till you see the giblet gravy.
- No, Alvin.

50:23.560 --> 50:25.010
We're going to be eating giblets

50:25.097 --> 50:26.639
in Attica if we don't get out of here.

50:26.914 --> 50:27.729
Boys!

50:27.954 --> 50:29.895
Boys, the dinner will be
ready in 10 minutes.

50:29.975 --> 50:32.933
- You better go take your showers.
- You got it, Mrs. A.

50:33.477 --> 50:34.214
Mrs. A!

50:36.308 --> 50:37.172
Oh, Mrs. A?

50:37.460 --> 50:38.852
Somethin' smells good.

50:39.489 --> 50:42.689
Nothin' better than that smell
in the whole, wide world.

50:43.379 --> 50:45.767
- It does smell good.
- Yeah. It smells good.

50:45.961 --> 50:48.029
We got the beginnings of
a real situation here.

50:48.748 --> 50:51.886
I just robbed these people.
I don't want to get to know them.

50:52.598 --> 50:53.642
Clove...

50:55.336 --> 50:57.104
I sense a conspiracy here.

50:58.611 --> 51:00.823
- Let's radio the feds.
- Hey...

51:02.104 --> 51:03.111
Clovis...

51:04.198 --> 51:05.804
You know what you are?

51:07.229 --> 51:08.236
What?

51:09.392 --> 51:11.101
- An alarmist.
- I am?

51:11.317 --> 51:12.285
Yes, you are.

51:13.085 --> 51:14.529
And that's not a good thing to be.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.211
- It's not?
- No, it's not,

51:18.517 --> 51:20.454
Especially when all this money's at stake.

51:22.161 --> 51:23.261
Bill, would you, uh...

51:24.248 --> 51:26.648
Would you please pass
me the giblet gravy?

51:29.129 --> 51:30.002
Thank you.

51:30.317 --> 51:32.361
Oh. There's some scallions in there.

51:33.854 --> 51:36.123
You know, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,

51:36.436 --> 51:39.604
I wanted to say my appreciation
for your hospitableness.

51:39.904 --> 51:41.592
'Cause I love these giblets.
Look at that.

51:42.679 --> 51:44.980
Scallions too.
But anyway,

51:45.148 --> 51:47.829
I just certainly hope we haven't
exposed ourselves upon you.

51:48.279 --> 51:49.873
No, no. Not at all.

51:49.929 --> 51:53.229
No, you know, It's been a nice
diversion having you three with us.

51:54.086 --> 51:57.319
Otherwise, we'd just be sitting around,
talking about that terrible robbery.

51:58.917 --> 52:01.461
Mr. Anderson, if you don't mind my asking,

52:02.145 --> 52:04.446
Exactly how much was taken?

52:05.017 --> 52:08.636
No. They just said they don't
want to talk about it, Dave.

52:09.217 --> 52:10.319
Well,..

52:11.268 --> 52:14.116
$275,000.

52:15.648 --> 52:18.607
See, I heard that banks
always claim, uh,

52:19.619 --> 52:21.161
that more was stolen...

52:21.245 --> 52:24.798
than actually was,
so they could claim double...

52:25.291 --> 52:26.417
on the insurance.

52:27.086 --> 52:28.892
Only a crook would do a thing like that.

52:28.998 --> 52:31.767
That would make me no different
from the people who robbed me.

52:42.288 --> 52:44.844
Yeah, but what about puttin'
all the people to work?

52:44.919 --> 52:47.463
You know, 'cause you have to have all
that extra security and everything.

52:48.113 --> 52:51.888
In fact, I heard that bank robberies
actually stimulate the economy.

52:52.282 --> 52:54.588
You're enormously misinformed, Mr. Firpo.

52:54.870 --> 52:56.432
The truth is that this robbery will,

52:56.526 --> 52:58.970
probably, put this little
bank out of business.

52:59.616 --> 53:00.751
How's that?

53:03.683 --> 53:05.157
Well, for years now, these...

53:05.263 --> 53:07.327
big-city banks have been
threatening to come in,

53:07.357 --> 53:09.171
wanting to take us over.

53:10.772 --> 53:14.163
And now with this robbery,
the FDIC will come in...

53:14.833 --> 53:18.112
and investigate, and find that
I make loans to people...

53:18.207 --> 53:19.508
just on a handshake.

53:19.895 --> 53:21.696
There's really no collateral at all.

53:22.189 --> 53:24.547
And that, gentlemen,
will be the end of that.

53:24.796 --> 53:25.538
Well...

53:26.357 --> 53:28.294
Excuse me, Mr. Anderson, but...

53:28.989 --> 53:30.858
I can't pretend to know too much
about these matters.

53:30.946 --> 53:32.857
However, if what you say is...

53:32.907 --> 53:34.858
true, which, I'm sure it is...

53:35.613 --> 53:38.389
then how could the bank
have so much cash on hand?

53:40.310 --> 53:42.982
Well, now, that's the worst part of it.

53:43.298 --> 53:45.262
That's a once-a-year deal.

53:46.000 --> 53:46.925
Over the years, I've...

53:47.081 --> 53:50.344
persuaded everybody in town to open up
a little Christmas club account.

53:50.431 --> 53:51.746
You know, nothing much, but...

53:52.446 --> 53:54.852
at the end of year, everybody
has a few extra dollars.

53:55.427 --> 53:56.427
It adds up.

53:56.958 --> 54:00.452
It gives everybody a little
extra security and pride.

54:01.158 --> 54:02.865
It kept main street alive.

54:04.564 --> 54:05.839
Not this year.

54:06.117 --> 54:08.933
No, sir.
Not this year.

54:16.161 --> 54:17.692
I just called the bus station for you.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.730
There's a road to the South
is open that's going to Philly.

54:19.801 --> 54:21.611
- Oh, that's excellent.
- Philadelphia?

54:22.336 --> 54:24.532
That's a little out of our way,
don't you think?

54:24.930 --> 54:27.820
Alvin, there's a train
from Philly to New York.

54:27.895 --> 54:30.592
It takes a couple hours.
Might get there by midnight, Alvin.

54:30.767 --> 54:32.824
Well, if you'd like to catch it,
we should probably go now.

54:32.949 --> 54:33.564
I think so.

54:34.067 --> 54:36.933
- Oh. Well, I'll make you some sandwiches.
- No, no. We're fine.

54:36.964 --> 54:38.792
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

54:38.861 --> 54:40.361
Do you need any money?

54:41.580 --> 54:43.230
- No, we couldn't.
- No, no.

54:43.661 --> 54:45.780
No. We've taken more
than our share already.

54:45.842 --> 54:48.580
No, no. Here. You take this.
You take this, and have...

54:48.630 --> 54:50.842
- ...a nice, happy, safe,..
- Mrs. A, please.

54:54.817 --> 54:56.692
- Oh, don't forget those coats.
- Thank you.

54:56.774 --> 54:58.455
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

54:58.524 --> 54:59.918
- Bye!
- Safe home!

55:00.057 --> 55:01.286
Come again any time.

55:01.411 --> 55:02.867
- Thanks for the suit.
- Thank you.

55:04.371 --> 55:07.068
Thank you for my festive sweater.

55:30.538 --> 55:32.538
Looks like they're going somewhere.

55:34.050 --> 55:35.569
Figured that out, did you?

55:37.109 --> 55:39.810
Did you see the way he was
holding that duffle bag?

55:39.878 --> 55:40.782
How?

55:42.282 --> 55:43.752
Same way I would.

55:44.175 --> 55:45.506
Close to my heart.

55:46.938 --> 55:49.382
If we're going for the money,
we're not waiting for nobody.

55:49.594 --> 55:51.202
- Right.
- What are you saying?

55:51.270 --> 55:53.975
That my boys wouldn't
come back and save me?

55:54.044 --> 55:57.957
That they'd rather have a couple of hundred
thousand bucks over a mother's love?

55:58.444 --> 56:00.369
I wouldn't pay three bucks for you.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.300
Can I ask you a personal question?

56:04.532 --> 56:06.407
What were you doing five years for?

56:06.473 --> 56:07.657
Stupidity?

56:08.033 --> 56:10.339
Hey, Edna, how'd you like to ride
in the trunk of the car?

56:10.406 --> 56:11.683
<i>Edna?
Edna?</i>

56:11.739 --> 56:13.770
Are we sleeping together?
I think not!

56:14.058 --> 56:16.458
You call me Mrs. Firpo, goddamn it.

56:16.527 --> 56:18.420
Come on, Caesar, don't
aggravate the old witch.

56:18.483 --> 56:20.185
I wish I was a witch.

56:20.426 --> 56:22.258
I'd shove my broomstick
right up your ass.

56:22.720 --> 56:25.620
I'll say whatever I want.
Do you like music?

56:26.295 --> 56:29.568
- ♪ Beautiful dreamer ♪
- Oh, Jesus!

56:29.636 --> 56:31.803
♪ Wake unto me ♪

56:45.528 --> 56:46.870
Thanks a lot.

56:53.202 --> 56:54.983
I don't see snow chains.

56:55.658 --> 56:58.427
This was very nice of you.
Please tell the Andersons...

57:01.096 --> 57:03.245
- What was that about?
- I have no idea.

57:03.764 --> 57:04.633
All right.

57:05.052 --> 57:07.445
I'll get the tickets.
You two separate.

57:07.539 --> 57:08.614
"Separate?"

57:08.689 --> 57:10.827
Just pretend like you
don't know each other.

57:12.964 --> 57:14.458
- Hey, do I know you?
- No.

57:14.520 --> 57:16.808
- Yeah? You look familiar.
- Well, I'm not.

57:17.089 --> 57:19.002
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you nut.

57:25.220 --> 57:26.914
We can't let 'em get on that bus.

57:27.695 --> 57:29.239
We're gonna take that money.

57:29.486 --> 57:31.689
You sure this is the right thing to do, Ed?

57:35.849 --> 57:38.083
Say, "Spill on aisle three."

57:40.083 --> 57:41.508
Spill on aisle three.

57:42.045 --> 57:43.833
You wanna be saying that
the rest of your life?

57:43.892 --> 57:44.792
No, I surely don't.

57:44.836 --> 57:46.773
- Then help me get that money.
- Okay.

57:51.839 --> 57:54.006
You're not gonna believe this,
but... but I don't...

57:54.348 --> 57:55.963
I don't have enough money.

57:57.887 --> 57:59.137
Wait a minute.

58:23.054 --> 58:24.237
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

58:28.731 --> 58:30.671
- Any luck?
- No.

58:30.912 --> 58:32.306
What am I...

58:34.956 --> 58:36.981
What am I gonna... do?

58:40.581 --> 58:42.163
That's my bus.

58:42.356 --> 58:46.401
- Going home to your family, huh?
- No, just my mother actually.

59:00.100 --> 59:01.287
Please...

59:02.437 --> 59:03.568
Please, I can't...

59:04.092 --> 59:06.843
I mean, I want it, but I'm sure...
I can't accept it.

59:06.970 --> 59:09.537
I do...
No, I can't.

59:10.037 --> 59:12.137
You're lucky you're in Paradise.

59:12.581 --> 59:13.868
Merry Christmas, sir.

59:22.182 --> 59:25.518
- Why don't you wait inside?
- Excuse me.

59:27.025 --> 59:28.453
He's got our money, Clovis.

59:29.672 --> 59:32.606
- Can I check your bags?
- Let's see what's in the bag.

59:32.706 --> 59:34.925
- What?
- FBI. The bag.

59:35.112 --> 59:38.100
- "The bag?"
- The bag, sir.

59:39.818 --> 59:41.887
- Hey!
<i>- Get him! Take him down!</i>

59:42.681 --> 59:44.756
<i>Freeze! Freeze!</i>

59:44.800 --> 59:47.786
- Don't move.
- Oh, shit!

59:53.291 --> 59:55.075
Oh, my God, a gun!

59:55.143 --> 59:59.113
- Oh, God, he's got a gun!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:59.181 --> 01:00:02.249
You got the wrong guy!
It's the guy with the floppy ears!

01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:05.475
- Let's go!
- What happened?

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:09.282
No! No! No!

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.137
What the hell is going on here?

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:21.615
- We may have found two of our suspects.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:24.637
Oh, shit!

01:00:24.956 --> 01:00:26.775
- What? You know him?
- Yeah, unfortunately.

01:00:26.812 --> 01:00:29.300
That's Ed Dawson and Clovis Minor.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:32.975
- They're both my deputies.
- Hey, how you doin', fellas?

01:00:44.588 --> 01:00:46.876
Now that, by God,..

01:00:47.357 --> 01:00:48.044
was close.

01:00:48.119 --> 01:00:49.397
That was close.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.775
Now our ride's gone.
Shit!

01:00:51.842 --> 01:00:54.609
- What the hell happened back there?
- I have no idea!

01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:56.338
I don't like this.

01:00:58.175 --> 01:00:59.369
We're screwed.

01:01:00.299 --> 01:01:03.039
Alright, come on. Y-Y-You gotta
think of a way to get us out of here.

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:06.127
All right!
Quit pressuring me, please!

01:01:07.689 --> 01:01:08.507
Look,..

01:01:09.988 --> 01:01:12.682
there's only one way I can think of
that's gonna get us out of here.

01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:14.851
It's a long shot.

01:01:15.176 --> 01:01:17.088
Let me get this straight.

01:01:17.163 --> 01:01:18.507
You telling me, you had no idea

01:01:18.538 --> 01:01:20.663
- ...what was going on in that bus station.
- No, sir.

01:01:20.816 --> 01:01:22.832
Your gun just happened to
go off three times in a row...

01:01:22.857 --> 01:01:25.101
- ...by itself.
- No. I thought...

01:01:25.795 --> 01:01:27.851
what I saw might be a suspect.

01:01:29.167 --> 01:01:29.995
So,...

01:01:30.194 --> 01:01:33.330
maybe my partner Clovis
and I got a little...

01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:36.530
over-... anticipatory.

01:01:37.198 --> 01:01:39.538
Agent Peyser... excuse me.
Excuse me...

01:01:39.632 --> 01:01:41.426
Will you guys knock it off, please?

01:01:41.923 --> 01:01:44.611
Just put the ball away for now.
Thank you.

01:01:45.754 --> 01:01:48.163
These kids tell me they saw three guys...

01:01:48.294 --> 01:01:50.180
push a car into the river this afternoon.

01:01:50.341 --> 01:01:52.669
They tell me they can show us
the exact spot.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:55.225
Hallelujah, huh?

01:01:58.488 --> 01:02:00.026
Are you coming along with us?

01:02:00.087 --> 01:02:02.901
No, no, no. Not you two.
You stay out of my sight.

01:02:04.092 --> 01:02:06.088
Will you just cool it?

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:34.244
You know, I just hate to ruin
this hallmark moment.

01:02:35.488 --> 01:02:38.614
Would you get over here and help me
lug this boat to the river!

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:59.532
♪ Do not hasten to bid me adieu ♪

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:04.469
♪ But remember the Red River Calley ♪

01:03:04.537 --> 01:03:06.677
♪ And a girl who has loved you true ♪

01:03:06.727 --> 01:03:09.207
That's it. We're done being nice to you.

01:03:09.275 --> 01:03:12.096
Get out, you pain in the ass.
I've had it with you.

01:03:12.157 --> 01:03:13.347
Enough is enough.

01:03:14.065 --> 01:03:15.952
- Come on. Get out.
- You call this being nice?

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:17.621
This is as nice as we're gonna get.

01:03:17.658 --> 01:03:20.190
Putting a gun to my head and dragging
me across three states

01:03:20.247 --> 01:03:21.858
on the night Christ was born.

01:03:21.918 --> 01:03:25.381
- Gag her.
- You're doing me a goddamn favor!

01:03:25.938 --> 01:03:27.740
You think this is torture?

01:03:28.002 --> 01:03:31.821
Anything's better than looking at you two
gorillas and listening to your horse shit.

01:03:32.027 --> 01:03:33.146
Just get in the trunk!

01:03:33.233 --> 01:03:35.590
You guys are dumber than a box of hair.

01:03:35.721 --> 01:03:38.815
- Gag her!
- Oh, cut it out. You can't...

01:03:38.883 --> 01:03:40.321
Good night, Edna.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.533
Hey, we made it!

01:03:46.127 --> 01:03:49.902
Come on. The harder we row,
the faster we go. Come on!

01:03:51.552 --> 01:03:53.995
Wha... wait a minute.
What?

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:57.508
- Bill, you're a genius.
- Yeah, but in the Firpo family,

01:03:57.583 --> 01:03:59.400
the man with half a brain is king.

01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:01.801
Come on. Row, row!
Like a viking, Alvin!

01:04:01.868 --> 01:04:04.237
- Row! Row!
- Like a viking!

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:07.452
Alvin!

01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:11.476
- Alvin!
- Alvin, come back!

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.597
Help! Help!

01:04:21.964 --> 01:04:25.727
Help! Help! Help!

01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:30.833
Help!

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.130
Down this side.
This side.

01:04:37.496 --> 01:04:41.284
Help! Help!

01:04:43.258 --> 01:04:44.677
- Look!
- Over here!

01:04:44.722 --> 01:04:46.052
Over by the rock.

01:04:46.971 --> 01:04:48.777
There's a man in the water.

01:04:49.821 --> 01:04:51.464
- Here! Right there!
- Hang on!

01:04:51.564 --> 01:04:53.019
We're gonna get you out of there.

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:54.771
Hold on, Alvin!

01:04:55.055 --> 01:04:56.558
I got ya!
I got ya!

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:02.019
Hang on, son.
Give me a hand.

01:05:02.087 --> 01:05:05.422
Hang on!
Grab my hand!

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:08.040
Alvin, grab his hand!

01:05:09.442 --> 01:05:12.178
Come on.
Just grab it.

01:05:14.515 --> 01:05:15.964
I got him!

01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:18.646
Right in this room.

01:05:18.777 --> 01:05:20.868
Lay him down by the fire.

01:05:26.821 --> 01:05:27.733
Oh, Christ, he..

01:05:28.071 --> 01:05:29.502
He looks like he's turning blue.

01:05:29.658 --> 01:05:32.144
- What's that mean?
- He's got water in his lungs.

01:05:32.212 --> 01:05:34.913
Just stay back there.
Give me some room here.

01:05:35.558 --> 01:05:38.796
Come on, son. Spit some
of that stuff out of there.

01:05:39.021 --> 01:05:40.946
Come on. There.

01:05:57.963 --> 01:05:59.752
That means he's going to be all right.

01:06:02.183 --> 01:06:03.119
Who are you?

01:06:03.669 --> 01:06:04.838
I'm Fred.

01:06:05.375 --> 01:06:06.858
- Flintstone?
- Yes.

01:06:08.871 --> 01:06:10.344
There.
He'll be all right now.

01:06:10.889 --> 01:06:12.945
How about a little soup and Brandy?

01:06:13.013 --> 01:06:14.108
Mix the two together?

01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:16.624
No, the Brandy's for me!

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:21.317
I think we lucked out with those kids.

01:06:22.004 --> 01:06:23.955
- Boy, the car's soaked good.
- Yeah.

01:06:23.985 --> 01:06:25.341
<i>Let's roll it over.
We gotta get it in the truck.</i>

01:06:25.379 --> 01:06:27.335
- <i>Anybody got a crowbar?</i>
- Yes.

01:06:27.391 --> 01:06:28.079
Yeah, get it.

01:06:28.104 --> 01:06:29.554
<i>We gotta get a crowbar here, okay?</i>

01:06:33.235 --> 01:06:34.798
Give me some light.

01:06:36.885 --> 01:06:38.493
Might find a walleye in there.

01:06:38.616 --> 01:06:40.293
- See anything?
- No.

01:06:40.487 --> 01:06:42.713
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:06:44.431 --> 01:06:46.000
What the hell are those things?

01:06:46.962 --> 01:06:48.037
Ski masks.

01:06:48.381 --> 01:06:50.356
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:06:50.812 --> 01:06:53.825
- Thank you. That's sweet of you.
- <i>Thank you very much.</i>

01:06:54.012 --> 01:06:56.150
That's my sister. You know.

01:06:56.687 --> 01:07:00.802
- I don't think you'll be able to smoke...
- I wanna thank you for saving my life.

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.993
- ...when we go into church.
- You know, almost drowning and everything.

01:07:03.181 --> 01:07:05.100
Oh, you don't have to put it out now.

01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:06.950
You could have puffed a little longer.

01:07:07.608 --> 01:07:09.543
Oh, this is nice.

01:07:14.894 --> 01:07:18.080
<i>Look, there's Timmy.
Merry Christmas, Timmy.</i>

01:07:19.907 --> 01:07:22.287
<i>Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you.</i>

01:07:22.557 --> 01:07:25.189
Oh, no! I thought you boys were
on your way to Philadelphia.

01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:28.217
Well, eh.. the...
bus left without us.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.228
Oh, well.
Merry Christmas.

01:07:31.332 --> 01:07:34.067
Can I talk to you a minute?
<i>Merry Christmas, father.</i>

01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:38.188
I'm going to confession.

01:07:39.451 --> 01:07:41.813
They don't have confession.
They're protestants.

01:07:42.707 --> 01:07:45.823
- Are you shitting me?
- No-o-o-o.

01:07:48.176 --> 01:07:49.545
I don't care.
I'm going in anyway.

01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:52.018
All right. I'll be out here with the...

01:07:52.424 --> 01:07:54.157
do-re-mi.

01:07:56.512 --> 01:07:58.150
Why... why are you still here?

01:07:58.454 --> 01:07:59.639
Why am I still here?

01:07:59.702 --> 01:08:01.902
What?.. You sound like you're
anxious to get rid of us.

01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:03.831
- What's the matter?
- I just wish you'd go.

01:08:04.056 --> 01:08:05.462
Why is that?

01:08:06.477 --> 01:08:07.422
You know,..

01:08:08.414 --> 01:08:10.502
I think you did something stupid today.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.821
Something you may regret.

01:08:13.683 --> 01:08:16.821
- Your last name isn't Collins, is it?
- No!

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.876
No, it's not, and...

01:08:19.064 --> 01:08:23.087
I've lied to a lot of people I care about,
so please, just go while you can.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.426
Sarah.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.819
- I can't.
- You can't what?

01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.430
I can't leave knowing what I know.

01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:44.395
What are you saying?

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:46.383
I'm saying...

01:08:46.983 --> 01:08:48.627
I'm saying, that I like these people too.

01:08:48.671 --> 01:08:50.746
I like them too.
And I wish that I could...

01:08:50.796 --> 01:08:52.926
think of something to
make this all better.

01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:56.345
Maybe you're not thinking hard enough.

01:08:59.327 --> 01:09:01.287
Look, can I ask you a question?

01:09:02.356 --> 01:09:04.071
Do you think people change?

01:09:04.852 --> 01:09:07.238
Do you believe a person can be
on one road their whole life,

01:09:07.296 --> 01:09:09.871
and then just back up and take another?

01:09:10.038 --> 01:09:12.585
- I think that all depends.
- Depends...

01:09:14.236 --> 01:09:15.267
on the road.

01:09:15.872 --> 01:09:17.354
It depends on the person.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.934
Depends on the person.

01:09:23.448 --> 01:09:25.223
Depends on the person.

01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:33.341
This headstone says Anderson.

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:37.242
Is that any relation?

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.567
It's Clifford's great-grandfather.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:46.014
1835-1892.

01:09:47.398 --> 01:09:48.460
God!..

01:09:49.535 --> 01:09:51.410
Your whole life's in that dash,
isn't it?

01:09:51.956 --> 01:09:52.904
Yeah.

01:09:56.832 --> 01:09:58.292
What are you doing?

01:09:59.804 --> 01:10:00.842
I don't know.

01:10:02.554 --> 01:10:03.986
You don't know me.

01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:07.754
Sorry.

01:10:31.573 --> 01:10:34.479
Easy, now. Easy, now, Merlin.

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:37.198
Bill, get in. Whoa!

01:10:38.023 --> 01:10:40.661
Bill, 20 years minimum.
Get in.

01:10:40.748 --> 01:10:42.223
Alvin, tell him to get in.

01:10:42.379 --> 01:10:45.079
I don't know about taking the kid's sleigh.
There's something ain't right about that,

01:10:45.117 --> 01:10:46.880
- ...you know what I mean?
- I'll get in.

01:10:46.928 --> 01:10:49.011
After all these presents and stuff.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:51.534
- Oh, no, cops!
<i>- Hey!</i>

01:10:51.591 --> 01:10:54.766
- Come on, Bill. Get in.
- <i>Hey, that's Timmy's sleigh!</i>

01:10:55.135 --> 01:10:58.036
What'd he call it?
Yahoo! Whoo!

01:10:58.685 --> 01:11:01.348
Come on, Merlin!
Come on! Come on!

01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:05.185
What do you call it? Gallop!
That's it! That's it! Come on! Come on!

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:17.643
Come on! Come on!

01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:20.588
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:25.793
Yahoo! Yahoo!

01:11:26.961 --> 01:11:30.129
Come on, Clovis.
I know a shortcut.

01:11:31.843 --> 01:11:32.793
What's going on here?

01:11:32.843 --> 01:11:36.602
I don't know, but those three guys
stole my kid's horse and sleigh.

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:41.562
Merlin! Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.909
- Merlin! Dad! They took Merl...
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:11:45.028 --> 01:11:48.195
- Stay here! I know that!
- But, dad, they took Merlin!

01:12:02.556 --> 01:12:05.660
- Good shot.
- Hey, see you guys.

01:12:06.499 --> 01:12:08.468
That wasn't fair!

01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:12.049
I hate this town.
I hate it.

01:12:12.262 --> 01:12:15.952
I hate it. Christmas Eve,
and my wife had the...

01:12:16.266 --> 01:12:19.118
I didn't get to see that thing
pop up on the Turkey.

01:12:19.273 --> 01:12:20.453
I was... I hate it.

01:12:23.574 --> 01:12:25.081
A sleigh?
Catch the sleigh!

01:12:25.568 --> 01:12:27.010
Faster! Faster!

01:12:27.078 --> 01:12:30.064
Come on! Come on! Go!

01:12:30.749 --> 01:12:32.316
Run! Run, Merlin! Run!

01:12:32.687 --> 01:12:36.386
- Whoo!
- Turn! Turn! To the right! Okay!

01:12:43.806 --> 01:12:46.711
Look out. Look out.
Jesus.

01:12:48.713 --> 01:12:50.713
Back up.
We're gonna lose them.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.834
- Oh, God!
- Go, Alvin, go!

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:00.018
Go!

01:13:00.118 --> 01:13:01.783
Alvin, do you know what you're doing?

01:13:01.852 --> 01:13:04.343
You do what you do, I do what I do!

01:13:04.877 --> 01:13:07.012
Then hurry up!

01:13:08.297 --> 01:13:12.366
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:13:23.078 --> 01:13:26.697
- Hi, officer! Bye, officer!
- Go! Yeah!

01:13:26.972 --> 01:13:28.409
Yes! Yes!

01:13:32.353 --> 01:13:33.290
Oh, my God!

01:13:37.972 --> 01:13:40.090
Unbelievable. Ow!
Unbelievable.

01:13:40.157 --> 01:13:42.899
Come on. Keep going. Go.

01:13:44.394 --> 01:13:47.113
- On 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em!
- Go! Go!

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.114
We got 'em. Come on!

01:13:49.182 --> 01:13:52.133
Run right up into them.

01:13:52.201 --> 01:13:54.369
Right up into them.

01:14:30.724 --> 01:14:32.268
Hey, Merlin.

01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:36.638
Hey, thanks a lot, okay?
We really appreciated it.

01:14:36.774 --> 01:14:38.593
I'm never gonna forget you.

01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:42.622
All right. You're a good horse.
Stay strong.

01:14:48.893 --> 01:14:51.393
Bill. Hey, Bill, wait a minute.

01:14:53.093 --> 01:14:55.024
We can't leave him here.

01:14:55.338 --> 01:14:56.382
I mean, er...

01:14:56.556 --> 01:14:58.843
I couldn't live with myself
if I froze a horse...

01:14:58.887 --> 01:15:00.606
You know what I mean, especially him.

01:15:00.668 --> 01:15:03.089
You're cracking up.
Both of you.

01:15:03.508 --> 01:15:04.681
Come on!

01:15:14.466 --> 01:15:17.600
You stay there, Merlin.
Stay there.

01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:20.796
Bill, we made it.

01:15:21.205 --> 01:15:22.818
Alvin, we made it.

01:15:23.911 --> 01:15:26.517
All right. Let's all stick our thumbs out
and look pitiful.

01:15:26.616 --> 01:15:27.939
That should be easy.

01:15:28.098 --> 01:15:30.971
Easy. Pitiful. Thumbs.

01:15:33.003 --> 01:15:36.242
- Hey, stop.
- Here we go. We're here.

01:15:37.574 --> 01:15:40.155
- I can't tell you how happy I am.
- Hi. How are you?

01:15:40.323 --> 01:15:42.524
My name is Dave, and I...

01:15:44.917 --> 01:15:46.230
Oh, man.

01:15:46.297 --> 01:15:48.727
<i>We were out here skiing,
and the back of it...</i>

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.430
Oh, man!
No, no, no.

01:15:57.974 --> 01:15:59.659
All right. All right!

01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:02.476
Oh, no!

01:16:03.117 --> 01:16:04.511
- Hold on, Merlin!
- You know what?

01:16:04.536 --> 01:16:05.692
Who needs you?
Forget it!

01:16:06.405 --> 01:16:07.315
We're coming, Merlin!

01:16:08.692 --> 01:16:10.650
- We gotta get him out.
- You're not gonna die.

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:12.786
You're not gonna die!
Cut it out!

01:16:15.527 --> 01:16:17.236
- Come on!
- Alright, hold him!

01:16:17.342 --> 01:16:19.324
He's coming! Get around his back!
Push him! Push him!

01:16:19.349 --> 01:16:23.361
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Get him out of the water!

01:16:23.429 --> 01:16:25.463
Push!
Go! Go!

01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:29.566
- Go!
- He's coming out!

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:42.461
<i>- Coffee?
- You bet.</i>

01:16:42.783 --> 01:16:46.152
<i>- Can I take your order now?
- I'm not quite sure.</i>

01:16:58.942 --> 01:17:00.080
Guys,..

01:17:01.428 --> 01:17:04.255
I still got the keys to the vault on me,

01:17:05.936 --> 01:17:06.771
and...

01:17:07.808 --> 01:17:09.255
I'm gonna go back to town,

01:17:10.574 --> 01:17:12.215
and I'm gonna put the money back.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:19.680
I know I didn't hear you right.

01:17:21.273 --> 01:17:24.230
Well, you can either come with me
or not, but that's what I'm doing.

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:28.892
Bill, I think that dunk in the lake...

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:30.394
got to your brain.

01:17:30.505 --> 01:17:35.286
- You are not thinking clearly.
- No, I'm thinking very clearly.

01:17:36.161 --> 01:17:38.624
You hear that?
Silent night, holy night.

01:17:38.717 --> 01:17:40.967
"Adeste fideles."
"God rest ye merry gentlemen."

01:17:41.067 --> 01:17:43.530
This is the best Christmas present
I could ever give to you.

01:17:43.655 --> 01:17:45.142
I appreciate the sentiment.

01:17:45.236 --> 01:17:47.693
You let me decide what
I get for Christmas, alright?

01:17:47.955 --> 01:17:50.330
This money belongs to me
and Alvin too, you know.

01:17:51.049 --> 01:17:52.986
It never belonged to us.

01:17:53.874 --> 01:17:56.480
- It belonged to the town.
- What are you telling me?

01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:59.462
That you are going to be the first
guy in history to get pinched...

01:17:59.611 --> 01:18:01.705
for putting money back into a vault?

01:18:01.822 --> 01:18:04.968
If I get pinched, I get pinched.
That's the way that one went.

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.618
I'm not gonna sit here
and argue with you about it.

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:10.555
Alvin, he's telling us what to do
with our share of the money.

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:11.902
Put my share back.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:19.805
What is wrong with you guys?

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:22.505
What you have a couple of
eggnogs with some farmers,

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:25.455
and now you wanna go back
and work for minimum wage?

01:18:27.161 --> 01:18:28.773
Make up your mind, 'cause I'm going.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:31.617
No, you're not. You're not going!
You are still a wanted man in New York!

01:18:31.661 --> 01:18:33.370
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

01:18:33.445 --> 01:18:35.026
No, he's not.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:36.920
All right?

01:18:37.749 --> 01:18:38.964
It's over.

01:18:41.095 --> 01:18:42.470
The whole thing...

01:18:43.301 --> 01:18:44.461
was a...

01:18:44.819 --> 01:18:45.950
setup...

01:18:46.678 --> 01:18:48.507
just to get you down here.

01:18:50.354 --> 01:18:52.914
Now, er... one other thing.

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.526
Does that look familiar?

01:18:58.032 --> 01:18:59.326
It's a little wet,

01:18:59.582 --> 01:19:00.920
but it's...

01:19:02.365 --> 01:19:03.545
it's yours.

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.200
You never...

01:19:08.763 --> 01:19:10.582
You never did drop it.

01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:15.674
What are you looking at?
What?

01:19:17.184 --> 01:19:19.751
But there were ten million cops
at the restaurant.

01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:25.401
I did it.

01:19:26.104 --> 01:19:27.607
I called them.

01:19:31.692 --> 01:19:33.101
I told them...

01:19:34.963 --> 01:19:37.139
I told them there was a sniper on the roof.

01:19:48.619 --> 01:19:50.101
You all right?

01:19:51.771 --> 01:19:54.673
Yeah, I'm all right.
Except...

01:19:58.193 --> 01:20:00.461
Sorry. Put the table on their tab.

01:20:00.764 --> 01:20:02.851
<i>He's got the spirit, don't he?</i>

01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:05.457
He handled that pretty well.

01:20:07.257 --> 01:20:09.353
Did you see my PEZ dispenser anywhere?

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:11.987
No. Shut up.
Check!

01:20:12.632 --> 01:20:15.245
Hey, hey! Excuse me, sir.
I've got an emergency.

01:20:15.289 --> 01:20:17.995
- Are you headed towards Paradise?
- No, I'm going to New York.

01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:21.039
Where were you five hours ago?

01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:24.351
- You going South?
- Nope.

01:20:25.389 --> 01:20:27.414
Hey, Edna, can I get you anything?

01:20:27.997 --> 01:20:30.176
Come on. Don't take all night
putting this gas in.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.370
Excuse me, guys.
Would you mind telling me,

01:20:32.407 --> 01:20:34.417
- ...which way you're headed?
- Get outta here!

01:20:34.492 --> 01:20:36.648
It's an emergency.
I've gotta get to Paradise.

01:20:37.976 --> 01:20:41.295
- We don't like to ride with strangers.
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.

01:20:41.551 --> 01:20:43.877
Ah, what the hell!
A little company might be good.

01:20:44.082 --> 01:20:44.951
Come on.
Jump in.

01:20:45.014 --> 01:20:46.151
I told you not to say anything.

01:20:46.195 --> 01:20:48.732
- I can keep a secret.
- No, I told you to shut up, and you...

01:20:48.776 --> 01:20:50.464
you're supposed to be
on my side, you know?

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.038
- Shit!
- What?

01:20:52.106 --> 01:20:55.558
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

01:20:56.693 --> 01:20:58.828
Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.873
- No, goddamn it!
- It's all right.

01:21:14.948 --> 01:21:15.873
Sons of bitches!

01:21:21.783 --> 01:21:24.127
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, guys.

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:25.745
Rough night?

01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:30.389
You have no idea what
kind of night I've had.

01:21:30.689 --> 01:21:34.424
I'm just real lucky you're
going the same way as me.

01:21:41.327 --> 01:21:44.689
- What's that banging noise?
- I don't hear nothing.

01:21:44.964 --> 01:21:46.020
Me either.

01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:51.185
Wait a minute. No, no, wait,
'cos there it goes again.

01:21:51.322 --> 01:21:53.822
It's a very distinct thumping sound.

01:21:54.122 --> 01:21:56.147
Kind of like a boom, boom, boom.
Don't you hear it?

01:21:56.396 --> 01:21:58.441
Oh, yeah. We've been
hearing that all night.

01:22:01.648 --> 01:22:03.352
Hey, can I share something with you?

01:22:03.477 --> 01:22:04.689
Yeah.

01:22:05.714 --> 01:22:07.958
Look, I know I just met you guys,
and it's kind of corny,

01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:10.021
but tonight's been a real
eye-opener for me.

01:22:10.589 --> 01:22:11.595
How's that?

01:22:12.258 --> 01:22:15.377
I just... I realized tonight
that I love people, you know?

01:22:15.445 --> 01:22:18.133
I mean... life is great.
Yeah?

01:22:18.195 --> 01:22:19.802
Huh? Isn't life great?

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.758
- You sound like you're in love.
- Well, as a matter of fact,

01:22:24.885 --> 01:22:27.989
I just met this really terrific woman.

01:22:28.452 --> 01:22:29.202
What's her name?

01:22:29.235 --> 01:22:31.291
I can really use something
like that in my life.

01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:32.910
- What's her name?
- Her name's Sarah.

01:22:33.004 --> 01:22:34.248
- Sarah?
- Yeah.

01:22:34.795 --> 01:22:35.540
You got a picture?

01:22:35.677 --> 01:22:37.252
Do you have any idea
how long it's been...

01:22:37.295 --> 01:22:39.573
since I've had a picture
of a woman in my wallet?

01:22:39.661 --> 01:22:40.786
Except my mother, of course.

01:22:41.832 --> 01:22:43.417
You got a picture of your
mother in your wallet?

01:22:43.468 --> 01:22:44.102
Oh, yeah.

01:22:44.264 --> 01:22:47.564
- I have the same thing in my wallet.
- Well, then let's compare.

01:22:48.595 --> 01:22:50.770
It's a beautiful thing.

01:22:51.707 --> 01:22:54.007
I really hope we can
all get to be friends.

01:22:55.295 --> 01:22:56.577
There she is.

01:23:09.833 --> 01:23:10.802
What are you doing?

01:23:10.839 --> 01:23:13.257
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!
- What are you doing?

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.940
Stop it! Are you crazy?
Stop it!

01:23:17.021 --> 01:23:18.763
- Put the gun down!
- Get off of me!

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:20.931
- The cops are down the street.
- He's got our money!

01:23:20.998 --> 01:23:24.134
- Just get in the car.
- I'll kill him.

01:23:48.039 --> 01:23:50.477
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Merlin!

01:23:50.552 --> 01:23:52.391
Hold on! Hold on!
Whoa!

01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:56.361
What do you call it? Whoa, Merlin!
That-a-boy. Okay.

01:23:57.108 --> 01:23:59.789
- Hey, look who it is!
- Get in, Bill.

01:23:59.846 --> 01:24:01.339
We gotta have a serious talk!

01:24:01.589 --> 01:24:03.146
- Now get me the hell outta here!
- Uh-oh.

01:24:03.208 --> 01:24:07.036
Serious talk. Come on.
Come on, Merlin.

01:24:13.389 --> 01:24:15.160
What do you call it?
Whoa.

01:24:15.357 --> 01:24:18.420
So, I guess we have a clean slate now.

01:24:19.933 --> 01:24:21.777
Good boy, Merlin.

01:24:23.008 --> 01:24:25.752
Go home now.
Stay off the interstate.

01:24:25.983 --> 01:24:27.514
There you go.

01:24:28.742 --> 01:24:29.902
Not quite.

01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:46.408
Quiet, okay?

01:24:47.806 --> 01:24:49.586
So I get into the car...

01:24:50.039 --> 01:24:51.439
with these two strangers,..

01:24:51.752 --> 01:24:54.308
and,.. now this is very funny...

01:24:56.533 --> 01:24:58.233
I show them a picture of ma,

01:24:59.114 --> 01:25:00.820
and they start shooting at me.

01:25:02.908 --> 01:25:05.445
- That's weird.
- That's weird, yeah.

01:25:05.527 --> 01:25:07.314
Do you have any idea why?

01:25:07.845 --> 01:25:09.364
Maybe it was a bad picture.

01:25:16.427 --> 01:25:17.527
Who are they?

01:25:19.583 --> 01:25:21.683
Hey, Bill, I mean, were they alone?

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.835
I said there were two of them.

01:25:23.927 --> 01:25:26.727
- There was nobody else with them?
- I just said there were two of them.

01:25:26.814 --> 01:25:27.833
They were alone.

01:25:28.673 --> 01:25:30.876
I just said there were two of them!

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.139
- Oh, good!
- What do you mean, "Oh, good"?

01:25:33.264 --> 01:25:34.197
I mean...

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:36.847
What do I mean, Dave?

01:25:37.272 --> 01:25:38.935
He... he...

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:41.185
He means that...

01:25:41.785 --> 01:25:43.360
if there were more than two,

01:25:44.191 --> 01:25:46.660
- ...you could have been hurt.
- Three's bad. That's right.

01:25:46.753 --> 01:25:48.635
I'm getting this feeling...

01:25:49.453 --> 01:25:51.558
that you're not telling me something!

01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:54.522
Yeah, well, this feeling you're
getting is paranoia!

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.030
- I don't think so!
- Well, then think again!

01:25:57.303 --> 01:25:59.603
Come on.
Let's just go.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.401
I'm almost certain this one's it.

01:26:06.878 --> 01:26:07.572
Hey, Bill!

01:26:08.272 --> 01:26:10.016
A guy in prison told me
if you use the wrong key,

01:26:10.053 --> 01:26:11.428
you could set off the alarm.

01:26:13.247 --> 01:26:15.397
Why don't you let me do the crackin'...

01:26:16.041 --> 01:26:17.631
and you do the jackin'?

01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:20.066
Hey, leave him alone, Bill.
Prison's a lonely place.

01:26:20.185 --> 01:26:21.703
- You told.
- Sure, I heard things in the night.

01:26:21.766 --> 01:26:23.041
Shut up!

01:26:26.178 --> 01:26:27.072
Shit! I told ya!

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:29.205
Stop the madness!
All right, all right, all right.

01:26:29.642 --> 01:26:31.809
It said "Nissan."
"Nissan."

01:26:31.877 --> 01:26:34.445
- "Nissan's" for a car.
- But it was round...

01:26:34.513 --> 01:26:36.553
- ...with a curve that goes like an "S."
- Okay! All right!

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.080
- Hurry up, Bill!
- Okay! Okay!

01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:40.601
You're kidding me.

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:45.972
- Agent Peyser?
- What?

01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:48.418
- Agent Peyser?
- What?!

01:26:48.655 --> 01:26:51.309
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, come on. Try me.

01:26:51.692 --> 01:26:53.612
We got another alarm at the bank.

01:26:55.617 --> 01:26:57.486
Yes! Yes!

01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:02.301
No! Shit!

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:22.835
I know what to do.

01:27:25.504 --> 01:27:28.524
That's the most money
I ever held at once.

01:27:29.505 --> 01:27:30.949
You're right, Bill.

01:27:32.415 --> 01:27:33.861
Never was ours.

01:27:35.843 --> 01:27:36.850
I tell you,..

01:27:37.343 --> 01:27:39.430
I never felt better in my life.

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.924
Where'd you go for that tire?
Palm Beach?

01:28:08.305 --> 01:28:09.492
Sorry, Ed.

01:28:15.805 --> 01:28:18.574
Holy shit. Get down, Clovis.
Get down.

01:28:18.999 --> 01:28:20.118
Boy, am I good.

01:28:22.199 --> 01:28:25.634
Get inside of the jeep,
or I'll blow your heads off.

01:28:39.249 --> 01:28:40.893
You know, every time there's a problem,

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.744
those two idiots show up.

01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:44.924
I'm telling you, they know something.

01:28:45.043 --> 01:28:47.768
Hey, listen, guys. Come on, where
are you taking us? What is this?

01:28:47.942 --> 01:28:49.805
Up to that bank president's house.

01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:52.486
Bank... bank president?
What are you talking about?

01:28:52.705 --> 01:28:54.230
What do you think, we're stupid?

01:28:54.297 --> 01:28:55.824
No, I don't think you're stupid,

01:28:55.874 --> 01:28:57.749
but I know how to keep you in suspense.

01:28:58.186 --> 01:28:58.880
How?

01:28:59.349 --> 01:29:01.192
I bet, I know how to
keep you in suspense.

01:29:01.811 --> 01:29:02.464
How?

01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:05.099
Clovis! They're bullshitting you!

01:29:05.811 --> 01:29:07.886
We know that's where the money is.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:09.599
Money? What money?

01:29:09.849 --> 01:29:10.555
Yeah, we...

01:29:10.614 --> 01:29:14.093
- We don't have any money.
- Oh, shut up, will you, for Christ sake?

01:29:14.192 --> 01:29:15.880
You don't think we know
what you're doing?

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:19.005
You and the Andersons probably
cooked this whole thing up together.

01:29:20.849 --> 01:29:23.511
Looks like they got company
with them in that Jeep.

01:29:23.793 --> 01:29:25.211
All units, this is agent Peyser.

01:29:25.255 --> 01:29:29.043
We are in pursuit of a...
1994 black "Pathfinder".

01:29:29.093 --> 01:29:32.530
- License plate D-u-h...
- Is that's appropriate?

01:29:32.836 --> 01:29:34.313
Vanity plates.

01:29:34.571 --> 01:29:36.684
D-u-h-1-7-1.

01:29:37.265 --> 01:29:41.059
Location east on main street,
heading toward river road.

01:29:43.589 --> 01:29:46.924
"So, uh, what kind of license
plate do you have?"

01:29:47.655 --> 01:29:49.317
"Duh."

01:29:58.855 --> 01:30:00.255
Come on! Move it!

01:30:02.294 --> 01:30:03.555
Come on!

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.355
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!

01:30:12.755 --> 01:30:14.442
Look at those clowns.

01:30:16.192 --> 01:30:17.786
- Why don't we just take 'em?
- No!

01:30:18.366 --> 01:30:19.893
Let's wait and see what they're up to.

01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:24.905
Hit the wipers.

01:30:28.393 --> 01:30:29.942
Am I nuts? I know those plates.

01:30:30.237 --> 01:30:32.005
Where do I know those plates from?

01:30:34.117 --> 01:30:36.124
Something came over
the wire tonight about...

01:30:36.199 --> 01:30:39.468
two escaped convicts in a...
caddy with New York plates.

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.888
That's right. Get on the horn.
Get everybody down here.

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.538
You're gonna have to kill me,

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:46.286
because I'm not dragging
those people in that house...

01:30:46.382 --> 01:30:47.232
into this.

01:30:47.707 --> 01:30:49.326
So why don't you just pull your trigger?

01:30:49.363 --> 01:30:51.718
Look! There's no money, all right?

01:30:51.825 --> 01:30:53.744
So just get it out of your head.

01:30:57.844 --> 01:30:58.918
They're here.

01:30:59.026 --> 01:31:00.507
- Yep.
- They're here.

01:31:00.632 --> 01:31:01.988
Let's take them down.

01:31:05.663 --> 01:31:07.513
Come on, pecker head!
Move!

01:31:08.226 --> 01:31:10.870
Clovis, watch these three clowns
while I check out the house.

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:11.651
Okay, Ed.

01:31:17.685 --> 01:31:18.996
Season's greetings.

01:31:19.344 --> 01:31:21.230
Santa Claus is coming to town.

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:24.894
Shut up and get inside.

01:31:24.969 --> 01:31:26.920
Well, well, well.
Doesn't that figure?

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:28.726
- Get out of my face, you psycho!
- Shut up and get in.

01:31:28.763 --> 01:31:29.576
Ma!

01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:31.313
What...

01:31:32.332 --> 01:31:34.812
- What... what are you doing here?
- I'm being held hostage,

01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:38.012
on the night baby Jesus was born.
What the hell does it look like?

01:31:38.168 --> 01:31:39.437
Get over there.

01:31:40.584 --> 01:31:42.288
Please don't tell me you knew about this.

01:31:42.388 --> 01:31:43.513
Uh, no. No, I...

01:31:45.926 --> 01:31:48.545
I'm sorry.
I know it's bad.

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.307
I'm sorry, ma.

01:31:55.738 --> 01:31:57.376
I'm sorry, everybody.

01:31:58.021 --> 01:32:00.963
- I swear I'm gonna get us all out of this.
- Oh, no. Come on.

01:32:01.191 --> 01:32:03.248
It wasn't your fault.
It was my fault, my...

01:32:03.422 --> 01:32:06.154
I... I convinced Bill that he was
a wanted man in New York

01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:08.211
and he had to come down here - no choice.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:10.957
But he resisted, every step
of the way, he did.

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:13.207
And... Sarah, he didn't know
about your father.

01:32:13.276 --> 01:32:14.844
- Yeah, sure.
- No, he didn't! He...

01:32:14.951 --> 01:32:17.282
He really thought he was dying,
and he came down here to help you.

01:32:17.356 --> 01:32:18.443
What are you talking about?

01:32:18.489 --> 01:32:20.656
Hey! Just give us the money,
and we're out of here.

01:32:20.805 --> 01:32:23.288
- That's all we want.
- You're in for a rude awakening, pal,..

01:32:23.332 --> 01:32:24.657
because there's no money! Okay?

01:32:24.808 --> 01:32:26.163
No! No!

01:32:26.269 --> 01:32:28.238
V-V-Vic, listen to me.

01:32:28.344 --> 01:32:30.038
There's no money. He's not lying.

01:32:30.394 --> 01:32:32.251
I swear... on my mother's grave.

01:32:32.301 --> 01:32:35.888
Don't say that with this lunatic
pointing a gun at my head.

01:32:35.995 --> 01:32:38.096
Are you telling me
you didn't rob the bank?

01:32:40.819 --> 01:32:42.332
Is it true?

01:32:44.132 --> 01:32:45.041
Yeah.

01:32:45.638 --> 01:32:48.338
We did it, Mr. Anderson,
and we're sorry.

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.482
But I swear we're not the same
people we were this morning.

01:32:51.519 --> 01:32:52.238
I swear it.

01:32:52.332 --> 01:32:56.232
- Oh, where's my violin?
- Vic, you gotta believe us.

01:32:56.412 --> 01:32:58.479
These people, they're good people.

01:32:58.685 --> 01:33:00.738
They took us in, and they treated us

01:33:00.788 --> 01:33:02.220
like we was one of their own.

01:33:02.283 --> 01:33:05.120
And all we could do in return
was steal from them.

01:33:10.769 --> 01:33:13.301
Vic, these people had
nothing to do with this.

01:33:13.507 --> 01:33:16.094
You gotta let 'em go!
We can solve this between us.

01:33:16.195 --> 01:33:18.213
I'll let 'em go as soon as I get my money.

01:33:18.344 --> 01:33:19.063
Vic!

01:33:20.082 --> 01:33:23.320
- We put the money back.
- Put it back? Back in the bank?

01:33:24.154 --> 01:33:25.453
No.

01:33:27.813 --> 01:33:29.607
We gave the money to the church.

01:33:29.832 --> 01:33:31.682
You expect me to believe
that horse shit?

01:33:31.844 --> 01:33:34.813
- Who wants to die first?
- Pop, will you knock it off?

01:33:44.632 --> 01:33:48.094
Who gets shot first?
Suspenders.

01:33:48.595 --> 01:33:50.212
Then maybe you.

01:33:53.274 --> 01:33:56.908
I say, get down. Get down.
Way down, boys. Get down.

01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:00.391
- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?

01:34:00.795 --> 01:34:03.808
I've got bad news.
We got a hostage situation.

01:34:04.282 --> 01:34:05.926
And your son's inside.

01:34:06.314 --> 01:34:08.657
Move! Move up!

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.307
<i>This is the FBI.</i>

01:34:12.688 --> 01:34:14.432
<i>You're completely surrounded.</i>

01:34:14.528 --> 01:34:15.807
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

01:34:15.857 --> 01:34:17.876
<i>Come out with your hands
above your head.</i>

01:34:18.008 --> 01:34:20.101
Sit down! Sit down, or I'm
gonna shoot somebody!

01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:20.795
Sit down!

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:23.988
I can't go back to prison.
I learned my lesson already.

01:34:24.051 --> 01:34:25.838
Look what you started, you big gorilla.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.945
Look what I started? I don't know,
what you're talking about.

01:34:27.992 --> 01:34:29.038
Your idiot sons!

01:34:29.113 --> 01:34:31.686
If it wasn't for them, we'd be in prison
without a care in the world.

01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:35.245
If it wasn't for your goddamn,
long-winded, piece-of-shit letter...

01:34:35.338 --> 01:34:38.476
whining about how your daughter
doesn't come visit you no more,

01:34:38.582 --> 01:34:40.838
I never would've sent my boys
down here in the first place.

01:34:40.963 --> 01:34:42.769
I never wrote any letter.

01:34:49.955 --> 01:34:51.026
Ma.

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.670
Who wrote what to whom?

01:34:54.788 --> 01:34:57.251
It's a moot point at this juncture.
Don't you think?

01:34:57.570 --> 01:35:00.201
Especially given the gravity
of the situation...

01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:02.176
out... side.

01:35:03.608 --> 01:35:05.320
It just never ends with you.

01:35:08.382 --> 01:35:09.332
No.

01:35:10.838 --> 01:35:13.450
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

01:35:13.695 --> 01:35:15.920
Nose is as long...

01:35:16.094 --> 01:35:18.326
as a telephone wire.

01:35:18.388 --> 01:35:19.995
Come on, Caesar.
We're getting out of here.

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:22.463
<i>- Come on, Caesar, let me go!
- Don't make me shoot you.</i>

01:35:22.513 --> 01:35:24.163
<i>- You're not gonna shoot me.
- Shut up. Shut up!</i>

01:35:24.238 --> 01:35:25.644
Liar, liar.

01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:28.926
- What starts in fun ends in tears.
- Liar!

01:35:29.051 --> 01:35:30.824
Caesar, I said let's get out of here.

01:35:34.423 --> 01:35:35.612
You son of a bitch!

01:35:39.833 --> 01:35:42.118
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

01:35:50.443 --> 01:35:52.162
<i>Stay on the floor!</i>

01:35:52.231 --> 01:35:54.044
Why don't you put some guns on me?

01:35:59.191 --> 01:36:00.475
Timmy!

01:36:02.478 --> 01:36:03.355
I got the guy.

01:36:03.417 --> 01:36:05.842
- I'm the one who got the guy.
- We've got it all under control, boys!

01:36:06.025 --> 01:36:08.281
- We've got it all under control, boys!
- This is a big mistake.

01:36:08.319 --> 01:36:09.606
I can explain everything.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.867
Clovis, what the hell did you do now?

01:36:12.935 --> 01:36:15.812
<i>Over here!
Move! Move!</i>

01:36:17.487 --> 01:36:18.369
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

01:36:18.405 --> 01:36:21.224
<i>Come on!
Get everybody out!</i>

01:36:24.294 --> 01:36:26.031
We didn't do that, did we?

01:36:33.175 --> 01:36:34.375
<i>Alright, let's go.</i>

01:36:35.688 --> 01:36:37.019
<i>Get him out.</i>

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.569
<i>Line them right up behind me.</i>

01:36:41.342 --> 01:36:43.827
<i>Come on. Keep moving.
Keep moving.</i>

01:36:43.944 --> 01:36:46.712
<i>Come on, guys. Let's go.
Keep it moving.</i>

01:36:47.362 --> 01:36:49.000
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

01:36:50.333 --> 01:36:52.150
Send those escaped cons back to New York

01:36:52.194 --> 01:36:53.593
before they ruin my Christmas.

01:36:55.687 --> 01:36:56.844
<i>All the way in.
Let's go.</i>

01:36:56.906 --> 01:36:58.823
Watch the shirt.
It was a present.

01:36:59.037 --> 01:37:00.662
I'm a deputy, for Christ's sake!

01:37:00.706 --> 01:37:02.505
I demand to know what the hell's
going on here!

01:37:02.628 --> 01:37:04.968
<i>Get some chairs out here.</i>
I didn't take Merlin.

01:37:05.003 --> 01:37:07.312
<i>Pull out some of those chairs.
See how many we can get.</i>

01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.993
<i>Pull out some of those chairs.
That'll be fine.</i>

01:37:21.510 --> 01:37:23.510
All right, all right, all right.

01:37:24.745 --> 01:37:26.094
Shut up!

01:37:28.462 --> 01:37:30.100
Shut... quiet, please.

01:37:31.168 --> 01:37:32.375
Thank you.

01:37:36.394 --> 01:37:38.190
Father Gorenzel, can we talk?

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:41.159
Of course, Sarah.
I'm always available to talk.

01:37:41.387 --> 01:37:43.227
Come in. Come in.

01:37:47.806 --> 01:37:50.066
You won't believe what happened.

01:37:50.442 --> 01:37:54.037
I just got back from church.
There was a knock on the door, and this...

01:37:54.424 --> 01:37:55.821
was lying outside.

01:37:55.890 --> 01:37:57.762
This note was with it.

01:38:01.169 --> 01:38:04.287
"Please take this money.
It belongs to the people of Paradise.

01:38:07.208 --> 01:38:08.631
The three wise men."

01:38:47.981 --> 01:38:49.450
What did he say?

01:38:50.984 --> 01:38:52.887
He said it's time to forgive.

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:59.356
I'm sorry, Cliff, that I didn't
tell you everything about myself.

01:39:00.933 --> 01:39:03.231
It wouldn't have mattered if you had.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.766
Uh, Mrs. Anderson,

01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:12.470
you were probably closest to the
perpetrators at the time of the robbery.

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.004
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

01:39:15.231 --> 01:39:16.000
Now!

01:39:16.144 --> 01:39:19.651
Can you identify these three men
as the men who robbed the bank?

01:39:35.218 --> 01:39:37.062
No, I don't believe so.

01:39:39.392 --> 01:39:41.287
How can you be so sure?

01:39:42.908 --> 01:39:45.050
Well, to begin with,..

01:39:45.494 --> 01:39:47.650
the robbers were wearing masks.

01:39:49.131 --> 01:39:50.587
- Deputy Timmy?
- Sir.

01:39:51.019 --> 01:39:52.575
You were in the house at the time.

01:39:53.075 --> 01:39:56.062
Why don't you tell the people
what the hell was going on?

01:39:58.881 --> 01:40:01.231
They saved us from being hurt.

01:40:02.012 --> 01:40:02.931
That's what happened.

01:40:03.106 --> 01:40:05.300
What a crock of stinking horse shit.

01:40:05.437 --> 01:40:07.831
What do you know?
You slept through the whole thing.

01:40:09.787 --> 01:40:13.731
I wanna know how exactly
you two seem to fit into all this.

01:40:13.937 --> 01:40:16.669
We're deputies, for Christ's sake.
Right, Bernie?

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:19.562
We were trying to make an arrest.

01:40:19.698 --> 01:40:22.635
These three were in my store
a half hour before the robbery,

01:40:22.723 --> 01:40:24.505
and they bought three ski masks.

01:40:24.671 --> 01:40:25.871
Well, whoa!
Wait a minute.

01:40:25.956 --> 01:40:27.962
Wait a min...
You withheld this information?

01:40:28.546 --> 01:40:30.352
Oh, Jesus, uh...

01:40:30.612 --> 01:40:32.262
Spill on aisle three.

01:40:33.462 --> 01:40:34.675
Spill on aisle three.

01:40:34.775 --> 01:40:36.862
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Spill on aisle three!

01:40:36.931 --> 01:40:41.231
Spill on aisle three!
Spill on aisle three!

01:40:41.262 --> 01:40:42.844
...and then everyone was
hustling sandals...

01:40:42.894 --> 01:40:43.881
Sit down! Sit down!

01:40:43.919 --> 01:40:46.119
- And I didn't... what?
- Sit down.

01:40:47.731 --> 01:40:51.303
This was something I didn't quite
put together till just now.

01:40:51.575 --> 01:40:53.606
If these three guys aren't the crooks,

01:40:53.831 --> 01:40:55.519
- I'd like to know...
- Sit down!

01:40:55.856 --> 01:40:58.976
Then where the hell are the three
ski masks they bought from my store?

01:41:04.494 --> 01:41:06.369
- You wanna see three ski masks?
- Yeah!

01:41:06.450 --> 01:41:07.281
Is that it?

01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:11.400
I'll show you three ski masks.

01:41:12.487 --> 01:41:13.343
Right in there.

01:41:15.625 --> 01:41:16.769
Hey, guess what?

01:41:17.298 --> 01:41:19.460
There's one,.. two...

01:41:19.806 --> 01:41:21.287
Can we make it three?

01:41:22.169 --> 01:41:23.450
- Three ski...
- Sit down, you clown!

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:24.181
Okay.

01:41:31.093 --> 01:41:33.427
Everything I got points to you three.

01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:36.981
And don't give me that "Who, me?" look.

01:41:37.744 --> 01:41:40.394
I can't believe the only thing I got
you on is some parole violation.

01:41:40.457 --> 01:41:42.126
You didn't rob the bank?
You didn't rob the bank?

01:41:42.226 --> 01:41:44.713
I wanna know exactly where you
were at the time of the robbery.

01:41:47.725 --> 01:41:49.581
They were with me Christmas shopping.

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:53.488
- What?
- It's true, agent Peyser.

01:41:53.756 --> 01:41:55.931
I saw them all go together.

01:41:56.281 --> 01:41:58.406
Now I remember.
I saw them too.

01:42:01.981 --> 01:42:05.400
All right, all right.
Shut up! Shut up!

01:42:06.418 --> 01:42:08.000
E-E-Ed, swallow that.

01:42:14.256 --> 01:42:15.837
Christmas shopping.

01:42:17.022 --> 01:42:19.587
Something tells me
I'm really getting jammed.

01:42:24.844 --> 01:42:26.169
Let me guess.

01:42:27.025 --> 01:42:29.687
- It's the money from the robbery.
- Money...

01:42:30.006 --> 01:42:31.762
Some... somebody...

01:42:32.455 --> 01:42:35.087
dropped it outside... my front door.

01:42:36.325 --> 01:42:38.410
And you have no idea
who it might have been?

01:42:38.625 --> 01:42:41.006
I don't know.
I-I was praying.

01:42:41.062 --> 01:42:43.552
Oh, well, you're a priest.
Yeah.

01:42:44.151 --> 01:42:46.418
We'll talk later.

01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:53.672
What the hell's going on in this town?

01:42:55.034 --> 01:42:57.772
What-what-what-
what-what-what...

01:43:15.165 --> 01:43:16.196
Come here.

01:43:16.851 --> 01:43:17.859
Come here.

01:43:26.541 --> 01:43:28.854
I don't know what the hell
happened in this town,

01:43:31.122 --> 01:43:34.572
and it's obvious nobody here
is gonna tell me.

01:43:35.341 --> 01:43:39.004
But I suspect that you three
are getting the break of a lifetime.

01:43:39.947 --> 01:43:42.510
Don't screw it up.
You understand?

01:43:43.716 --> 01:43:45.860
'Cause it's not gonna come around again.

01:43:46.922 --> 01:43:48.429
We won't, sir.

01:43:54.961 --> 01:43:56.541
Get out of here.

01:44:08.299 --> 01:44:09.366
Ma.

01:44:16.045 --> 01:44:17.979
Give me that.
You're gonna lose it.

01:44:20.222 --> 01:44:21.316
Well,..

01:44:22.047 --> 01:44:24.207
I know it sounds dumb, but...

01:44:26.104 --> 01:44:27.960
I'm really proud of you three.

01:44:30.722 --> 01:44:32.004
Thanks, ma.

01:44:32.872 --> 01:44:35.354
And you're through with
all this nonsense, right?

01:44:35.516 --> 01:44:38.097
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.578
You got it, ma.

01:44:44.338 --> 01:44:45.504
Hey, what?

01:44:50.979 --> 01:44:53.457
- I paid for that.
- Mine.

01:44:53.854 --> 01:44:56.225
- I paid for that.
- I didn't see nothing.

01:44:56.697 --> 01:44:58.179
- Tell her, Dave. I paid for it!
- No.

01:44:58.222 --> 01:45:00.006
- You saw me buy it.
- I saw nothing.

01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:03.173
- Tell it, Dave!
- I'm a blind man.

01:45:03.285 --> 01:45:06.952
- I... I... you're not...
- Who's lying now?

01:45:17.885 --> 01:45:19.804
I guess I just want to say good-bye.

01:45:20.210 --> 01:45:21.060
I'm glad.

01:45:22.366 --> 01:45:24.247
Did things work out between
you and your dad?

01:45:24.397 --> 01:45:25.208
Well,..

01:45:25.822 --> 01:45:27.810
I guess I got nothing to hide now, so...

01:45:28.916 --> 01:45:30.115
I don't know.

01:45:31.447 --> 01:45:32.815
Maybe there's hope for him.

01:45:33.279 --> 01:45:34.385
Good.

01:45:38.385 --> 01:45:39.089
It's my bus.

01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.633
- I guess I better get going, right?
- Yeah.

01:45:46.304 --> 01:45:49.185
Listen. How would you feel if I were to
settle down in a place like this?

01:45:49.416 --> 01:45:52.060
A place like this?
Or this place?

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:55.347
You know, maybe I could manage
some little restaurant down here.

01:45:55.429 --> 01:45:58.279
Get you half off on lunch,
free coffee with every meal.

01:45:58.741 --> 01:46:01.922
I'll see you every morning in the bank
when I'm making my deposits.

01:46:02.106 --> 01:46:05.491
- Stay out of the bank, all right?
- Give me a chance.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.229
- Bill...
- Maybe we could hit it off.

01:46:15.766 --> 01:46:16.910
Look.

01:46:54.929 --> 01:46:57.116
Check out Bill.
He's really going for it.

01:46:57.697 --> 01:47:00.880
- Hey, man, get a room!
- What for?

01:47:04.610 --> 01:47:06.752
Hey, ma, what are you so happy about?

01:47:07.191 --> 01:47:09.755
Well, your brother's
got himself a girlfriend.

01:47:10.266 --> 01:47:11.757
- Is he coming with us?
- No.

01:47:11.825 --> 01:47:13.758
- Should we go get him?
- No, you sit down.

01:47:13.826 --> 01:47:15.141
He's staying here.

01:47:16.491 --> 01:47:20.530
Speaking of which, when are
you two gonna get hitched?

01:47:20.598 --> 01:47:23.517
- "Get hitched."
- We're not even attracted to each other.

01:47:33.679 --> 01:47:34.760
Bye, mom!

01:47:35.862 --> 01:47:37.796
Bye, Dave! Bye, Alvin!

01:47:37.864 --> 01:47:39.797
