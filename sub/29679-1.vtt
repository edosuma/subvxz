30:04.933 --> 30:06.979
Alex?
- Uh uh uh uh.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.851
I've seen this one, it
is the stupid friends

30:09.895 --> 30:11.897
who go around searching
for their stupid friends

30:11.940 --> 30:16.031
in the fog alone at night
who get killed first.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.993

31:09.606 --> 31:11.391

31:48.950 --> 31:52.911

[chuckling]

31:56.566 --> 31:57.306
- Dear

31:58.568 --> 31:59.308
Penthouse.

32:03.356 --> 32:04.313
- No, uh-uh.

32:05.706 --> 32:07.664
- I wanna see you.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.276
- Come on, you'll like it.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.408
- I wanna see you.
- Yeah?

32:22.897 --> 32:26.031

32:49.010 --> 32:50.011
like a little

32:51.273 --> 32:51.970

33:00.065 --> 33:01.066

33:07.246 --> 33:08.943
What are you doing?

33:12.033 --> 33:13.034
Ted?

33:20.041 --> 33:23.566
[clanging]
What was that?

33:29.094 --> 33:31.879
[squelching]
Ted?

33:31.922 --> 33:33.315
Oh man,

33:33.359 --> 33:34.142
so soon?

33:37.276 --> 33:38.016
Ted.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.891
I don't wanna play anymore.

33:48.504 --> 33:49.288
Ted?

33:53.205 --> 33:54.206
Ted, stop.

33:56.425 --> 33:57.122
Let me go.

34:12.092 --> 34:13.094
Ew.

34:16.184 --> 34:17.577

Lorena, come on!

35:02.839 --> 35:03.927
- It's Ted!
- Ted?

35:03.971 --> 35:05.364
- Ted!

35:05.407 --> 35:07.409
- What the hell did Ted do?
- There was so much blood!

35:07.453 --> 35:09.150
Oh my god, we gotta
get outta here!

35:09.194 --> 35:11.283
- Whoa whoa whoa
whoa, calm down, okay?

35:11.326 --> 35:12.588
Calm down.
- No, Alex!

35:12.632 --> 35:15.548
- Calm down.
- There was blood!

35:15.591 --> 35:16.723
- Okay.
- My god,

35:16.766 --> 35:17.637
there was so much blood!
- What happened?

35:17.680 --> 35:19.073
Where is he?
- I don't know!

35:19.117 --> 35:20.596
I didn't see him!
- Okay, all right, all right.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.945
We'll just go back
to the shed, okay?

35:21.989 --> 35:23.512
- No!
- All right, whoa whoa!

35:23.556 --> 35:24.948
All right, all right, all right,

35:24.992 --> 35:26.646
we'll go back to
the house, okay?

35:26.689 --> 35:28.474
We'll just go back, okay?

35:28.517 --> 35:29.301
All right.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.739
Hey, Lorena, wait!

[gasping]

35:36.221 --> 35:37.961
- Nicole,

35:38.005 --> 35:38.788
Nicole!

35:40.442 --> 35:43.489
Nicole, Nicole, Nicole!

35:43.532 --> 35:44.794
Sebastian!

[rock music]

35:50.496 --> 35:51.236
Nicole?

35:53.368 --> 35:54.848
- They aren't here.

35:59.505 --> 36:02.551
Besides, Sebastian couldn't
keep that quiet anyway.

36:02.595 --> 36:04.336
- Am I losing my mind?

36:05.989 --> 36:08.775
Seb and Nicole are missing,
Ted is injured in the least

36:08.818 --> 36:10.864
and you're acting like this?

36:10.907 --> 36:12.300
There was blood everywhere!

36:12.344 --> 36:13.562
I don't think--
- Lorena!

36:13.606 --> 36:16.478
Ted's just an
asshole, all right?

36:16.522 --> 36:20.308
He's my closest friend,
but he's an asshole.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.310
He ditched you,

36:22.354 --> 36:23.790
that happened.

36:23.833 --> 36:28.751
And it's not even in Ted's top
10 douche bag things to do.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.712
Seb and Nicole are probably out
there looking for us anyway.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.280
So I'm gonna go out
there and find them

36:35.323 --> 36:37.020
and bring 'em back here.

36:37.064 --> 36:41.155
You can go upstairs,
wash up, get dressed

36:41.199 --> 36:43.462
and calm the hell down, okay?

37:02.307 --> 37:05.266
[suspenseful music]

37:18.410 --> 37:20.238
- Know what I need to do.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.414
You take another shower.

37:22.457 --> 37:23.241
Asshole.

37:25.721 --> 37:27.419
I'm gonna show you.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.947

You thirsty?

39:01.600 --> 39:02.340
Aw.

Get you some water.

39:32.413 --> 39:33.414
Stop it.

[thudding]
Would you stop it?

39:37.157 --> 39:37.940
Go!

39:40.508 --> 39:41.901
Just hide there.

39:43.032 --> 39:46.949
Please hide there.

Thank you, Nicky.

You know, last month I was
so bummed because I missed

40:47.706 --> 40:49.882
this trip to Dollywood.

Please, this totally
makes up for it.

thought it would be with--

- Yeah.

No, no.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.030
It's complicated.

I totally get complicated.

You're a fucking unicorn.

42:08.787 --> 42:13.574
- No, look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

Look, whatever, whoever
it was you think I,

Oh man.

42:27.849 --> 42:31.113
Look, I can't, I really can't.

42:31.157 --> 42:32.985
I have a girlfriend.

42:33.028 --> 42:34.769
You met her, you know?

42:36.205 --> 42:37.685
Her name is Nicole.

Look, I.

liquor to forget everything

we saw tonight.

Where did you bring us, who
are your fucked up friends?

I supposed to say?

46:13.945 --> 46:18.036
Hi, my father murdered my
family and tried to kill me?

46:18.079 --> 46:20.603
That doesn't come up
in daily conversation.

- Years, Nicole.

46:22.388 --> 46:24.216
Years of conversations.

freak, Lorena, okay?

46:28.002 --> 46:31.484
I always have been,
that Shepard Farm girl.

46:33.051 --> 46:34.835
I just,

46:44.584 --> 46:46.934

46:55.769 --> 46:57.858
- What the hell happened
to you, where's Ted?

46:57.902 --> 47:01.383
- Ted is dead and Alex is out
there, he's probably dead too.

47:01.427 --> 47:02.950
And if we don't get
the fuck out of here

47:02.994 --> 47:06.475
we're gonna be next so Memory
Lane is fucking closed.

Mother fucker!

47:42.207 --> 47:44.078
- Still think I'm overreacting?

47:44.122 --> 47:46.037
- But who would've done this?

47:46.080 --> 47:48.300
- Well it certainly
wasn't Ted and not Alex.

47:48.343 --> 47:51.390
- Fucking Daddy Deliverance
and his daughter wife.

47:51.433 --> 47:54.001
You saw the fucked up shit
they were doing, Nicky!

47:54.045 --> 47:55.873
