[Jughead] It was over,

00:03.786 --> 00:06.093
the evils of Stonewall Prep
had been vanquished,

00:06.136 --> 00:10.358
and life in Riverdale
more or less picked up
where it had left off.

00:12.099 --> 00:16.581
But at its heart,
Riverdale was and is,
"A wicked little town."

00:18.105 --> 00:20.324

Veronica told me,
that you're... sick.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.114
Well, clearly
my daughter's confused
'cause I'm perfectly healthy.

03:22.158 --> 03:24.291
But if she's concerned
for some unfounded reason,

03:24.334 --> 03:28.643
then you'll agree that
she doesn't need
to know about this.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.950
-Mr. Lodge, look
if you need help--
-What I need is privacy.

03:31.994 --> 03:35.258
This is not your business,
nor hers, frankly.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.912
Do we understand

Yes, sir, we do.

Take the plate off.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.574
So, I talked to
all your teachers
and we figured out a way

03:46.617 --> 03:49.316
-for you to catch up
on all of your classes.
-[thuds]

03:50.317 --> 03:53.363
Phew! That's not
daunting at all.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.453
-There's an index.
-Mmm-hmm, and it's color coded.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.238
Red is for American history.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.023
You missed the mid-term,
so you can catch up
by writing an essay

04:01.066 --> 04:03.504
on either the Trail of Tears
or the Salem witch trials.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.462
-Salem witch trails,
definitely.
-Mmm-hmm.

how Sisyphus must have felt.

04:20.608 --> 04:23.350
Given how far behind I am
on literally every topic,

04:23.393 --> 04:25.700
is it even worth trying
to catch up at this point?

04:26.440 --> 04:29.269
Look. I know this is a lot.

04:29.312 --> 04:32.489
It's a lot of work,
but it's only for
a couple of months.

that you graduate. With me.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.016

than that?

04:42.020 --> 04:44.936
Jughead. What a surprise.
What do you need?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.112
Something to stimulate my brain
as I plow through

04:47.156 --> 04:50.115
this pile of work
that Betty's lined up for me.

04:50.159 --> 04:52.509
I was thinking
in between writing
these mind-numbing essays

04:52.553 --> 04:57.427
I could help you review
the latest round of videotapes
from our mysterious voyeur.

04:57.471 --> 04:59.951
Absolutely, I could use
some help scrubbing
through the footage.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.345
The voyeur's stepping up
his or her game.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.999

his way inside a house.

unless she asks me directly.

I'm sorry, but you won't be
allowed to do a number

from Hedwig and the Angry Inch.
That show is...

05:49.784 --> 05:52.177
It's not appropriate
for students and families.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.744
It was on Broadway.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.312
-There's a movie version of it.
-An R-rated movie version.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.837
Look, why don't you do a number
from a classical musical

05:59.881 --> 06:02.013

06:02.057 --> 06:04.886
Instead of some niche-downtown
cabaret show
