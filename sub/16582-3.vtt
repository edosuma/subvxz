WEBVTT

00:06.060 --> 00:08.058
Previously on "Graves"...

00:08.060 --> 00:11.059
I will be your goddamn
president.

00:11.060 --> 00:14.059
News of former first
daughter Olivia Graves'

00:14.060 --> 00:16.059
marriage dissolution
has been confirmed.

00:16.059 --> 00:19.059
Jeremy's coming home in a few days,
which is to say I'm a nervous wreck.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.092
FaceTime with Jeremy,
no Treadwell, got it.

00:21.133 --> 00:23.132
I need you to tell the old man
that I'm gonna be staying

00:23.133 --> 00:24.132
at home with him and Mom
for a little while.

00:24.133 --> 00:27.132
We want you to run
for Tom Udall's Senate seat.

00:27.133 --> 00:29.132
Stop it.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.905
- Annie.
- First Lady.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.132
If you run for Senate,
this is gonna be fun.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.132
I haven't said yes yet.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.132
America's arcane detention

00:37.133 --> 00:39.132
and deportation
policies can be traced back

00:39.133 --> 00:41.132
to the Graves
administration.

00:41.133 --> 00:44.132
How many of your parents
came here illegally?

00:44.133 --> 00:47.132
Any of these
undocumented workers,

00:47.133 --> 00:50.775
if they want to come out to my compound,
they're more than welcome.

00:50.776 --> 00:52.133
What have you done?

01:09.133 --> 01:12.132
I don't fucking
believe it.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.132
President Graves.
Hi.

01:13.133 --> 01:15.132
How many are there?

01:15.133 --> 01:16.132
272.

01:16.133 --> 01:19.132
Actually, 273
to be exact, sir,

01:19.133 --> 01:22.133
if you count the baby that was born
at 4:00 A.M. this morning.

01:25.008 --> 01:26.007
A baby?

01:26.008 --> 01:28.007
Yes, sir.

01:28.008 --> 01:30.008
Boy or a girl?

01:30.446 --> 01:32.445
Oh, I have no idea, sir.

01:32.446 --> 01:34.445
Oh.

01:34.446 --> 01:38.445
You know, of course this probably
couldn't have happened on a worse day.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.445
Your son is arriving
this afternoon.

01:40.446 --> 01:43.445
You know, you say one thing,
Isaiah, in the moment

01:43.446 --> 01:45.445
to make a point
and then you...

01:45.446 --> 01:48.445
Then it blows up. I know. I know.
It's really bad.

01:48.446 --> 01:50.445
No, you're missing
the point, Isaiah.

01:50.446 --> 01:53.445
"The boisterous sea
of liberty

01:53.446 --> 01:56.445
is never without a wave."
Thomas Jefferson.

01:56.446 --> 01:58.445
It's a good thing.

01:58.446 --> 02:02.445
- Messy as hell.
- Yes, sir, but...

02:02.446 --> 02:04.446
I assume Margaret's
having a heart attack.

02:06.446 --> 02:09.445
I'm gonna have a heart attack.
We have to fix this.

02:09.446 --> 02:12.445
I'm way ahead of you. Just got
off the phone with the White House.

02:12.446 --> 02:15.445
Buenos diÂ­as, ninos.

02:15.446 --> 02:19.445
They sent Secretary Burns, Homeland
Security, to talk to Richard.

02:19.446 --> 02:22.446
- He lands in an hour.
- Inside.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.445
I want you to get out
a press release.

02:29.446 --> 02:31.446
Spinning it which direction?

02:36.446 --> 02:38.445
This was planned.
That's the spin.

02:38.446 --> 02:41.445
Right down to the refugee
camp in our driveway.

02:41.446 --> 02:45.916
And Richard Graves gave this interview
because this is exactly what he wanted.

02:45.917 --> 02:49.737
All that those oppressed people are asking
for is to come to this country,

02:49.738 --> 02:52.143
work hard, and contribute.

02:52.144 --> 02:54.445
And the Graves family
will stand proudly by them

02:54.446 --> 02:56.445
because that is what we do.

02:57.927 --> 02:58.854
Done.

03:07.446 --> 03:09.446
Senor.

03:10.446 --> 03:12.446
Mira.

03:15.446 --> 03:18.445
Mr. President, I'm gonna have
to ask you to go back to the house.

03:18.446 --> 03:19.445
Not gonna happen, Martin.

03:19.446 --> 03:21.445
These folks
are my guests.

03:21.446 --> 03:23.445
Senor Presidente!
Senor Presidente!

03:23.446 --> 03:25.445
- Whoa, whoa, back off.
- Hello.

03:25.446 --> 03:28.445
Yes, senor. Gracias.

03:28.446 --> 03:29.445
All right, easy now.

03:29.446 --> 03:31.445
This is crazy.

03:31.446 --> 03:34.445
- Hey, give me some love.
- Hey! Hey!

03:34.446 --> 03:37.445
Everybody back!
Everybody back!

03:37.446 --> 03:38.445
Everyone back away!

03:38.446 --> 03:41.445
- Everybody back.
- Oh, my God!

03:41.446 --> 03:43.803
God damn it!
I did not want this to happen.

03:45.446 --> 03:46.445
Is everyone okay?

04:20.004 --> 04:22.444
You're not firing
your Secret Service detail.

04:22.446 --> 04:24.445
The hell I'm not.
I just did.

04:24.446 --> 04:26.445
They just drove off the property
10 minutes ago, ma'am.

04:26.446 --> 04:29.445
Maggie, I need
the shackles off.

04:29.446 --> 04:32.134
- I just need them off.
- It's his right to decline.

04:32.135 --> 04:33.445
Nixon did it in '85.

04:33.446 --> 04:37.445
Yeah, there were plenty of people
that wanted to kill that psychopath.

04:37.446 --> 04:39.445
Enough, Richard, please.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.445
These people outside,
this is a problem.

04:42.446 --> 04:45.445
I understand why you did
all this, honey, I do.

04:45.446 --> 04:47.445
Your heart was in
the right place,

04:47.446 --> 04:50.445
but I need you
to focus, okay?

04:50.446 --> 04:53.445
Well, I didn't mean this to happen,
Maggie. It just happened.

04:53.446 --> 04:56.445
But it needs to be fixed
as quickly as possible.

04:56.446 --> 04:58.445
As much for those people
out there as for us.

04:58.446 --> 05:01.445
And also Jeremy
is coming home today.

05:01.446 --> 05:04.445
It's a lot to handle.

05:04.446 --> 05:05.871
Okay, what do you
want me to do?

05:05.872 --> 05:08.445
We've set a meeting with the Secretary
of Homeland Security.

05:08.446 --> 05:10.445
- Oh, he's a little shit.
- He's expecting you.

05:10.446 --> 05:12.445
Talk to him.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.445
You have the best interests
of these people in mind, honey.

05:15.446 --> 05:18.445
I just need you to be back
here before Jeremy arrives

05:18.446 --> 05:21.445
'cause we're cooking
a big family meal.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.915
I want him
to feel special.

05:23.916 --> 05:25.446
Okay, okay.

05:28.086 --> 05:29.918
You make sure he's here.

05:29.919 --> 05:31.445
Yes, he will be.
No problem.

05:31.446 --> 05:33.445
And he never should have
given that interview, Isaiah.

05:33.446 --> 05:35.445
You let that happen.

05:35.446 --> 05:37.445
Yeah, he was
so intimidating, ma'am.

05:37.446 --> 05:40.445
The president of the United
States intimidating, really?

05:40.446 --> 05:43.445
No, I know.
I tried...

05:43.446 --> 05:45.445
You need to learn
to pivot.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.445
Direct him away
from those cliffs

05:47.446 --> 05:49.445
he's so hell-bent
on going over.

05:49.446 --> 05:51.445
- Understand?
- Yes, of course.

05:51.446 --> 05:53.446
Pivot.
I'm so sorry.

05:56.446 --> 05:58.445
This is bullshit.

05:59.168 --> 06:01.445
Ramona, make sure
they have enough water.

06:01.446 --> 06:03.445
Of course, Mrs. Graves.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.445
The story's leaked, Maggie.
CNN will go with it top of the hour.

06:06.446 --> 06:08.445
- Good.
- Mother!

06:08.446 --> 06:10.445
I have 14
new Google alerts.

06:10.446 --> 06:14.900
Yeah, hop aboard the Olivia Graves
train to public humiliation.

06:14.901 --> 06:16.445
Next stop, Italy.

06:16.446 --> 06:19.446
Do you see them, Mother?
Do you see them?

06:21.446 --> 06:23.445
And I'm sorry,
why are there Mexicans

06:23.446 --> 06:25.445
literally all over
the fucking place?

06:25.446 --> 06:27.445
Actually, honey,
your father's invited a few hundred

06:27.446 --> 06:30.446
undocumented immigrants
over for asylum. Coffee?

06:31.446 --> 06:33.445
Wait, I'm so...
what are you talking about?

06:33.446 --> 06:36.445
I need you to help Ramona
feed those needy people.

06:36.446 --> 06:41.445
We're all pitching in just
like we always do. Being charitable.

06:41.446 --> 06:43.445
We're gonna need to up
your meds, Mother.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.445
There's no way
I'm going out there.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.445
Oh, yes,
you are, Olivia.

06:46.446 --> 06:50.445
And put on anything else.

06:50.446 --> 06:51.800
Start with a bra.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.845
They get amnesty.

06:56.126 --> 06:58.446
The president
appreciates your gesture.

06:58.646 --> 07:00.445
Truly, sir.

07:00.446 --> 07:03.019
A temporary work visa,
the least you can do.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.659
It's not gonna happen, sir.

07:04.660 --> 07:07.445
The president respects you
and your legacy,

07:07.446 --> 07:09.445
so it is with the utmost
highest regards...

07:09.446 --> 07:14.445
For God's sake, Burns, we're talking
a couple of hundred people here.

07:14.446 --> 07:16.445
A symbolic gesture.

07:16.446 --> 07:19.445
There was a baby born
on my property.

07:19.446 --> 07:22.445
It... what the hell
was it?

07:22.446 --> 07:25.445
Oh, it was a boy, sir.
Yeah, they named him Graves.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.445
Little Graves Martinez.

07:27.446 --> 07:29.445
Did you hear that, Burns?

07:29.446 --> 07:31.445
Mr. Graves, sir, I'm here
on behalf of the White House

07:31.446 --> 07:35.445
to formally request that you quietly ask
your houseguests to vacate your property.

07:35.446 --> 07:39.445
Or I've been assured, though it
is not the president's desire,

07:39.446 --> 07:42.445
that Immigration
and Customs Enforcement

07:42.446 --> 07:45.446
will be forced to execute
deportation notices.

07:48.446 --> 07:53.445
You tell that asshole
in the Oval Office

07:53.446 --> 07:58.446
to kiss my ass.

08:02.446 --> 08:04.446
- Here you go.
- Gracias.

08:06.446 --> 08:07.446
You're welcome.

08:11.446 --> 08:14.445
- Agua?
- Que bella.

08:14.446 --> 08:16.446
That's so sweet of you.

08:34.446 --> 08:38.445
- Agua?
- Gracias, senorita.

08:52.446 --> 08:53.446
Muchas gracias.

09:09.446 --> 09:12.446
So my car's just right
down over here, sir.

09:14.446 --> 09:16.445
Sir, you haven't been without your detail
for 40 years, okay?

09:16.446 --> 09:19.445
- Just look left and right.
- I'm not a goddamn four-year-old.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.445
Car! Car!

09:21.446 --> 09:23.445
Asshole.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.445
Former president
of the United States.

09:25.446 --> 09:28.445
You know,
vulnerability, Isaiah,

09:28.446 --> 09:32.445
is one of the most underestimated
of human emotions.

09:32.446 --> 09:35.446
Yes, sir. The square is really crowded.
My car is just there.

09:38.446 --> 09:40.241
Hey!

09:41.446 --> 09:43.445
Dude, that interview
that you gave,

09:43.446 --> 09:46.445
how George Washington
would blow his brains out

09:46.446 --> 09:50.445
if he could see how we fucked
things up, was so sick.

09:50.446 --> 09:51.983
You saw that interview?

09:51.984 --> 09:54.445
Yeah. Why is that
so surprising to you?

09:54.446 --> 09:58.445
Oh, no, that's not... today's just
been kind of a crazy day.

09:58.446 --> 10:00.445
Lots of various fires
to put out.

10:00.977 --> 10:03.445
- Are you okay?
- I'm pivoting.

10:03.446 --> 10:04.445
You on a break?

10:04.446 --> 10:06.445
My shift actually doesn't
start for a while.

10:06.446 --> 10:08.445
I just like
to hang out here,

10:08.446 --> 10:11.445
observe the normals
in their natural habitat.

10:11.446 --> 10:13.445
Sir, we're already running
behind schedule for Jeremy.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.445
I know,
for Christ's sake.

10:16.896 --> 10:18.445
Bad day?

10:18.446 --> 10:21.446
Oh, just a complicated day.

10:22.446 --> 10:25.445
Sir, this is kind
of our cue.

10:25.446 --> 10:28.445
You know, Samantha,
I've become unshackled.

10:28.446 --> 10:32.445
My new guiding principle
is total spontaneity.

10:32.446 --> 10:35.445
I'm right there with you.

10:35.446 --> 10:38.446
And it starts right now.

10:40.446 --> 10:44.445
Oh, yeah, this is
a great spontaneous idea.

10:44.446 --> 10:47.445
Passed this place
100 times,

10:47.446 --> 10:49.445
but my detail would
never let me go in.

10:49.446 --> 10:52.445
Yeah, for good reason, sir. Look at it.

10:52.446 --> 10:55.445
We've really got to work on
your anxiety threshold.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.445
You just need to learn
how to relax a little bit.

10:56.446 --> 10:58.445
Relax? Sammy,
I've got an ex-president

10:58.446 --> 11:00.445
in a biker bar
in a part of town

11:00.446 --> 11:03.445
where literally the Secret Service
would probably want their own protection.

11:03.446 --> 11:07.446
This is a moment,
be here for it.

11:08.446 --> 11:10.446
Afternoon, everybody.

11:15.446 --> 11:19.445
If you're drunk and you
know it, clap your hands...

11:19.446 --> 11:21.445
'Cause the president
of the United States

11:21.446 --> 11:24.445
is buying your fucking
drinks, y'all. Ow!

11:27.446 --> 11:28.445
To nipples.

11:28.446 --> 11:30.445
To nipples!

11:30.446 --> 11:33.445
Without 'em,
tits wouldn't have a point.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.445
Hold on, wait a minute.

11:38.446 --> 11:40.445
Stan, do the thing.
Do that thing.

11:40.446 --> 11:42.445
All right.

11:42.446 --> 11:43.445
I am not a crook.

11:43.446 --> 11:46.445
Not Nixon.
The other thing.

11:46.446 --> 11:50.002
I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

11:50.003 --> 11:52.445
No, man, your Graves.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.815
Do your Graves.

11:53.816 --> 11:56.445
My fellow Americans.

11:56.446 --> 11:58.445
All I have to say is that

11:58.446 --> 12:01.445
freedom saves
and so does Graves.

12:01.446 --> 12:04.445
No, no, no, no.
I don't do that.

12:04.446 --> 12:07.445
- No.
- Whatever that was.

12:07.446 --> 12:09.643
- You do kind of do that.
- Sort of a sustained growl, sir.

12:11.446 --> 12:15.446
Fuck all of you.

12:16.446 --> 12:17.769
Tits, mother.

12:18.984 --> 12:21.446
You're unusually
off your game.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.444
You know when
someone's on edge

12:24.446 --> 12:28.445
and it only takes
that one little whisper

12:29.009 --> 12:30.445
to push them off?

12:31.113 --> 12:32.445
Don't be that whisper.

12:38.446 --> 12:40.445
Where the hell
is your father?

12:48.446 --> 12:52.445
Screw me till I can
remember your name.

12:52.446 --> 12:55.445
I never told you
my name, ma'am.

12:55.446 --> 12:58.446
Screw me till
you tell me your name.

13:04.446 --> 13:06.445
You want to dance, Prez?

13:06.446 --> 13:08.446
No. No, thank you.

13:11.446 --> 13:12.445
What's wrong?

13:12.446 --> 13:16.445
You got the "I Fucked Up
the Middle East" blues or what?

13:18.446 --> 13:21.445
No, it's my son.

13:21.446 --> 13:24.445
- He's coming home today.
- Mmm.

13:24.446 --> 13:26.445
I don't know how
to talk to him.

13:26.446 --> 13:30.445
I seem to always
say the wrong things.

13:30.446 --> 13:34.445
Well, who hasn't fucked up their kid
in some small but significant way?

13:34.446 --> 13:36.445
It's the little cruelties.

13:36.446 --> 13:40.445
It's the things that go unnoticed
by everyone except for children.

13:40.446 --> 13:42.445
And some are bigger
than others.

13:42.446 --> 13:44.445
I mean,
take a look around.

13:44.446 --> 13:47.445
The progeny
of inattentive parents

13:47.446 --> 13:49.446
in all their glory.

13:51.118 --> 13:55.118
So, I wouldn't be too late
for soldier boy.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.445
- Isaiah.
- Yeah?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.445
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

14:01.129 --> 14:03.446
- I love you.
- Have a nice day.

14:20.446 --> 14:21.445
What the fuck?

14:26.446 --> 14:28.445
Jeremy!

14:28.446 --> 14:29.445
Hey.

14:29.446 --> 14:31.445
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

14:31.446 --> 14:32.445
Oh, my God!

14:32.446 --> 14:34.445
I missed you so much.

14:34.446 --> 14:36.445
- My sweet angel.
- Love you, too, Mom. Okay. Okay.

14:36.446 --> 14:39.446
- Hooker.
- Ass clown.

14:41.446 --> 14:43.445
So is no one going
to mention the fact

14:43.446 --> 14:46.445
that there's a Cinco de Mayo
tent party in the front yard?

14:46.446 --> 14:48.445
Your daddy's making
a statement, sweetheart.

14:48.973 --> 14:51.265
You are not going to believe
what I have been going through.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.445
My life is a hot
fucking mess.

14:53.446 --> 14:55.445
That's crazy, sis, 'cause
Afghanistan was like Candyland

14:55.446 --> 14:57.445
but with
never-ending hand jobs.

14:57.446 --> 14:59.835
Sweetheart, why don't you go ahead
and get cleaned up for dinner?

15:03.446 --> 15:05.445
- He's not here, is he?
- Your father wanted to be here.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.445
You fucking kidding me?

15:16.446 --> 15:18.446
- Welcome home, soldier.
- Hi, Dad.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.665
- You look great.
- Thank you.

15:30.446 --> 15:32.009
Where the hell
have you been?

15:32.034 --> 15:34.034
I'm here, Maggie.

15:43.446 --> 15:45.445
Hey, Iz.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.445
Iz?

15:47.446 --> 15:48.445
We're on
a nickname basis?

15:48.446 --> 15:51.445
Dude, can we talk
about today?

15:51.446 --> 15:54.445
The old man's like really
going through some shit, huh?

15:54.446 --> 15:56.446
Yeah, apparently.

15:58.446 --> 16:03.445
You know,
I think I owe you an apology.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.444
Really?

16:05.446 --> 16:08.446
Ever since we met,
I've been a bit of a jerk.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.445
More than a bit, actually.

16:11.446 --> 16:13.445
Mm-hmm. Go on.

16:14.071 --> 16:17.445
It's just this family,
the things that go on.

16:17.446 --> 16:20.016
Family, I can't imagine.

16:20.017 --> 16:22.445
No, seriously,
they are so dysfunctional.

16:22.446 --> 16:27.445
I mean, it might actually be unhealthy
for me to even be around these people.

16:27.446 --> 16:30.445
And the president,
he is nothing...

16:30.446 --> 16:35.446
I mean, nothing like I thought
he would be on any level.

16:36.446 --> 16:40.017
He urinated in the bushes
off the highway last night.

16:40.018 --> 16:41.714
Who hasn't?

16:41.715 --> 16:44.857
The president of the United
States, that's who.

16:44.858 --> 16:46.445
Or who shouldn't.

16:46.446 --> 16:48.445
Well, your bubble's burst.

16:48.830 --> 16:51.445
People disappoint.
Welcome to the world.

16:53.685 --> 16:55.445
Maybe I'm just
off my game.

16:56.412 --> 16:58.445
Oh, you've got game?

16:58.940 --> 17:01.444
Yeah, somewhere.

17:01.446 --> 17:03.446
Sorry.

17:06.445 --> 17:08.444
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

17:08.445 --> 17:09.750
- Oh, my God.
- What?

17:09.751 --> 17:11.445
I've got to go.
I'm so sorry.

17:19.940 --> 17:21.445
Thank you, Ramona.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.378
Slow down, honey.

17:28.259 --> 17:29.259
Thank you, Ramona.

17:33.446 --> 17:35.750
I don't think I slept the
entire time you were gone.

17:35.751 --> 17:38.445
Yeah? You build up
a tolerance to the Ambien?

17:38.446 --> 17:39.445
That's me.

17:39.446 --> 17:42.445
So, son,
now that you're home,

17:42.446 --> 17:46.445
you have any thoughts,
plans?

17:46.446 --> 17:49.445
Yeah, Dad, you know, I do.
I got a lot of stuff brewing.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.445
Entrepreneurial ventures.
Projects, you know?

17:51.446 --> 17:53.445
Next-gen stuff, so...

17:53.446 --> 17:56.074
Great. Well, tell me. Maybe I can help.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.445
Yeah, the thing is, right now it's
kind of in the embryonic stages.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.445
And besides, with all the crazy
shit that Liv's going through,

18:01.446 --> 18:03.099
I mean, I don't want
to step on her toes.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.445
Oh, no,
I think it's best

18:04.446 --> 18:06.445
to step outside
myself right now.

18:06.446 --> 18:08.445
Let's just focus on you.

18:08.446 --> 18:12.445
You know, Jeremy, I can
pull any strings to help you.

18:12.446 --> 18:15.445
Yeah, no, I don't know. I think
what's actually best for me right now

18:15.446 --> 18:17.445
is to just...

18:17.446 --> 18:19.045
take a break, you know?

18:19.046 --> 18:21.445
Get myself back
into the civilian lifestyle.

18:21.446 --> 18:23.445
Reentry is a bitch
after all.

18:23.446 --> 18:24.689
And with all
the incidences of PTSD...

18:24.690 --> 18:27.445
Oh, for Christ's sake,
you were slinging hash.

18:27.446 --> 18:30.445
- Food service operations.
- Richard.

18:30.446 --> 18:32.445
It's an important job,
Mr. Graves.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.043
If soldiers don't eat,
they die.

18:35.044 --> 18:37.445
They die.
Muerte, all right?

18:37.446 --> 18:38.445
And just for your
information,

18:38.446 --> 18:41.445
the most injuries happen
in the food hall, okay?

18:41.446 --> 18:42.445
Just that's a fact.

18:42.446 --> 18:45.445
Remove one cog
and the wheel won't turn.

18:45.446 --> 18:46.749
Everybody plays
their part.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.445
President Graves!
Hi. Wow.

18:49.446 --> 18:53.085
I'm so sorry to interrupt, sir,
ma'am, but there's an emergency.

18:53.086 --> 18:54.445
What is it, Isaiah?

18:54.446 --> 18:56.445
Homeland Security
is headed here

18:56.446 --> 18:57.860
to execute
deportation notices.

18:57.885 --> 18:59.446
Daddy, you have
to stop them.

19:00.984 --> 19:02.445
Those poor people.

19:02.446 --> 19:04.445
Deportation notices?
For Ramona?

19:04.446 --> 19:06.445
Damn it.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.445
- Hang on, Richard.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

19:09.446 --> 19:11.445
Ramona made you icebox pie.

19:11.446 --> 19:13.446
- Oh, icebox pie.
- Richard, wait!

19:16.446 --> 19:20.446
I missed this.
All of us together.

19:22.446 --> 19:24.445
Richard, hang on.

19:24.446 --> 19:26.445
You're speaking
to Secretary Burns again?

19:26.446 --> 19:27.763
Yes, I'm gonna call him,

19:27.764 --> 19:30.445
have another little sit-down
in a neutral place.

19:30.446 --> 19:35.445
Okay, listen to me. Earlier you
made a perfectly reasonable request

19:35.446 --> 19:39.445
and he chose to totally disregard a
former president of the United States.

19:39.446 --> 19:44.445
And that son of a bitch is sending
immigration officers here to our home

19:44.446 --> 19:46.445
to embarrass us
and our family.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.446
You need
to give him hell.

20:08.272 --> 20:09.892
This is where
you wanted to meet?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.201
Neutral.

20:12.446 --> 20:14.445
At the very least, sir,
this is false imprisonment

20:14.446 --> 20:17.084
of a member of the cabinet who
was handpicked by the president

20:17.085 --> 20:18.445
and approved by the Senate.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.445
Well, what are you
gonna do?

20:21.446 --> 20:23.445
Here's the deal,

20:23.446 --> 20:25.383
so listen up.

20:26.134 --> 20:30.133
If any immigration agent
sets foot on my property,

20:30.628 --> 20:33.133
my wife and I
will link arms

20:33.134 --> 20:37.133
with the most photogenic little
brown babies we can find.

20:37.134 --> 20:40.133
Then we're gonna
scream bloody murder

20:40.134 --> 20:42.133
about the DREAM Act,

20:42.134 --> 20:45.133
about these poor
undocumented children

20:45.619 --> 20:50.067
to every news outlet
on the planet to see.

20:51.134 --> 20:54.133
The frail old president

20:54.134 --> 20:58.515
and the beautiful
former First Lady...

21:00.134 --> 21:03.134
just wanted to help
these children.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.672
You tell that empty suit
in the White House

21:07.673 --> 21:11.133
that I'm gonna shove my bully
pulpit so far up his ass,

21:11.529 --> 21:15.135
he'll be shitting low
approval ratings for years.

21:16.694 --> 21:18.694
You think you can
do that for me?

21:22.134 --> 21:24.133
I knew you could.

21:24.921 --> 21:26.134
Isaiah.

21:34.134 --> 21:36.133
You can't leave
Santa Fe

21:36.134 --> 21:39.134
without trying
the tamales from Posa's.

21:40.134 --> 21:43.134
Love to your wife.
God bless.

21:45.134 --> 21:47.134
I am so, so,
so sorry.

21:50.134 --> 21:51.651
I'm a coconspirator.

21:51.652 --> 21:53.133
I'm gonna take
the fall for this.

21:53.134 --> 21:55.133
It'll never touch you.
It has to land on me.

21:55.134 --> 21:59.133
Isaiah,
take your tampon out

21:59.134 --> 22:00.636
and relax, okay?

22:00.637 --> 22:02.133
I'm not gonna take
the tampon out.

22:02.134 --> 22:04.133
I'm expressing serious
concerns here, sir.

22:04.134 --> 22:07.774
There is a line, sir, that you
cannot expect me to cross.

22:07.775 --> 22:11.133
With all due respect,
hazing is over.

22:11.134 --> 22:12.550
There need
to be some boundaries.

22:12.551 --> 22:15.605
I get it. You have nothing
to lose, but I do.

22:15.606 --> 22:17.606
I know I do, sir.

22:19.707 --> 22:23.134
Look, kid,
trust me.

22:23.859 --> 22:26.003
You make that
so hard, sir.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.133
Oh, hi.

22:37.134 --> 22:39.133
Don't worry,
it gets worse.

22:39.134 --> 22:41.133
Oh, yeah, well...

22:41.134 --> 22:43.697
You know, I don't think
we were properly introduced.

22:43.698 --> 22:46.729
I wanted to welcome you home and
thank you for your service.

22:46.730 --> 22:48.283
You don't need
to kiss my ass.

22:49.627 --> 22:51.134
You want to know
the weirdest thing?

22:51.865 --> 22:54.133
I just got back
from Afghanistan.

22:54.134 --> 22:57.584
This place feels like
the real war zone.

23:00.134 --> 23:02.134
I give you two days
before you quit.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.601
Gracias.

23:08.134 --> 23:10.134
Muchas gracias.
Gracias.

23:19.802 --> 23:20.934
Your Spanish is good.

23:21.134 --> 23:25.133
I had a thing with the king
of Spain's son when I was 16.

23:25.134 --> 23:27.133
He cheated on me
with a Bush twin.

23:27.583 --> 23:31.096
Not okay, but to be fair, we all
made out with the Bush twins.

23:32.134 --> 23:35.133
Your English,
you... you speak.

23:35.134 --> 23:40.134
Yes, yes,
I taught myself.

23:47.511 --> 23:50.133
I noticed
you've been watching me.

23:50.134 --> 23:52.133
God.

23:52.134 --> 23:54.133
Sorry, that's terrible,
isn't it?

23:54.134 --> 23:56.870
No, no, it's okay. I've
been watching you, too.

23:58.134 --> 23:59.134
Oh, my God.

24:01.372 --> 24:04.133
I mean,
you feel this, right?

24:04.134 --> 24:07.133
Because it's crazy.
I don't even know your name.

24:07.675 --> 24:09.134
My name
is Arturo del Rey,

24:09.976 --> 24:12.134
son of Jose
and Margarita del Rey.

24:15.511 --> 24:17.134
Oh, God.

24:50.134 --> 24:53.134
Muchas gracias, Presidente Graves.
Muchas gracias.

24:55.134 --> 24:57.133
Hello.

24:57.134 --> 25:02.133
Oh, my.

25:18.887 --> 25:21.135
So what's all this
really about?

25:24.134 --> 25:27.678
Well, happy accident.

25:30.836 --> 25:32.133
You know, Jeremy...

25:32.134 --> 25:34.133
I don't know
what I'm doing yet.

25:34.134 --> 25:37.326
You know,
I... I have no idea.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.134
I'm just happy
you're home.

25:42.134 --> 25:44.134
And I missed you.

25:47.134 --> 25:50.134
Yeah, well,
I missed you, too.

26:06.134 --> 26:07.878
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:07.903 --> 26:11.134
Sorry, let me
just get my pants off.

26:12.134 --> 26:14.134
God, I hate this part.

26:28.954 --> 26:29.954
What?

26:36.134 --> 26:38.133
And in Santa Fe
this morning,

26:38.134 --> 26:40.133
a number of undocumented
immigrants

26:40.134 --> 26:43.133
who had sought refuge
on the Graves family compound

26:43.134 --> 26:46.133
have been granted temporary
visas by the White House.

26:46.134 --> 26:50.133
A symbolic gesture from one
president to his predecessor.

26:50.134 --> 26:52.133
Buena suerte.

26:52.134 --> 26:55.134
Anyway,
who wants breakfast?

27:22.134 --> 27:23.134
Mi rey.

27:30.693 --> 27:31.693
Last night was...

27:35.134 --> 27:36.540
This is for you.

27:39.134 --> 27:41.133
I have to go.

27:41.134 --> 27:43.134
Mi vida.

27:45.134 --> 27:47.134
Be careful.

27:59.134 --> 28:01.134
I will.

28:02.134 --> 28:05.134
I will!
I will!

28:40.800 --> 28:42.723
Obviously, it's
been really busy, Annie.

28:42.724 --> 28:44.355
I'm sorry I haven't
gotten back.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.492
I get it and I'm
sorry to just show up,

28:46.546 --> 28:50.023
but I'm a pusher.
The RNC is nervous.

28:50.024 --> 28:52.545
And this is just
too important.

28:52.546 --> 28:57.545
In two days you've helped drag Republican
immigration policy into the future.

28:57.546 --> 29:00.546
Proof of concept. We need
you to run against Nash.

29:02.546 --> 29:03.817
Richard.

29:04.246 --> 29:06.245
This is Annie Novak.

29:06.270 --> 29:07.269
I know who she is.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.545
Honey, they've asked.

29:09.546 --> 29:13.545
I mean, they've asked me
to run for the Senate.

29:14.305 --> 29:20.498
