WEBVTT

00:08.576 --> 00:11.212
- Captain's Log.

00:11.279 --> 00:13.514
We've been on edge since Gwyn
showed us what happened

00:13.581 --> 00:15.449
to the last "Protostar" crew.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.186
- Mayday! Mayday!

00:18.252 --> 00:21.689
This is Captain Chakotay
of the USS "Protostar."

00:21.755 --> 00:24.692
- The mystery surrounding
our ship still haunts us...

00:24.758 --> 00:26.627
- Captain, send out
the warning.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.362
We are being board--

00:28.429 --> 00:32.666
- Janeway most of all.

00:32.733 --> 00:37.505
We are all frustrated
we can't find out more,

00:37.571 --> 00:39.707
but, in the meantime,

00:39.773 --> 00:42.943
we've discovered
a welcome distraction.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.115
Yes! Whoa!

00:47.181 --> 00:48.916
It's still hot!

00:48.982 --> 00:50.384
- Let's go farther.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.790
- That was at least 200 meters!

00:57.491 --> 00:58.859
- Mmm, floor pie.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.261
- It smells amazing!

01:00.328 --> 01:01.729
- And it's delicious!

01:01.795 --> 01:04.498
- The transporter's some kind
of teleportation machine.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.167
It converts the pie
into energy,

01:06.234 --> 01:08.869
then reconverts it back.
Wow.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.938
- We need
a living test subject!

01:11.004 --> 01:12.106
- Don't look at me!

01:12.173 --> 01:13.341
- Who?

01:13.407 --> 01:16.244
- Murf is indestructible...

01:16.310 --> 01:18.546
- Ah.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.348
- So we can keep track of you.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.251
I love you, Murf.
Don't worry.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.085
* *

01:25.153 --> 01:26.387
- Energize.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.322
[console beeping]

01:28.389 --> 01:30.258
[transporter humming]

01:30.324 --> 01:31.925
- [chirruping]

01:42.770 --> 01:44.104
- Whoa!

01:44.172 --> 01:45.038
- Open it.
- Hurry up.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
- Murf?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.308
- Murf?
- Murf?

01:47.375 --> 01:48.476
- Where's Murf?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.411
- He should be right here.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.779
- Yes.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.414
Murf?

01:53.481 --> 01:55.183
- [laughs]

01:55.249 --> 01:58.719
- [humming]

01:58.786 --> 02:00.821
- Oh, he just keeps going,
doesn't he?

02:06.059 --> 02:08.996
[dramatic music]

02:09.062 --> 02:16.204
* *

03:39.420 --> 03:41.121
- He's okay!
- Yeah!

03:41.188 --> 03:44.258
- Aw, you still look
as handsome as ever.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.959
- "Protostar" crew
to the bridge.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.762
We have
an incoming distress signal.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.899
- Please, I need
immediate transport.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.735
My warp core is compromised.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.539
I have sick orphans aboard
who need help.

03:58.606 --> 04:02.343
- We're the only ship within
two parsecs of its location.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.378
- We need to help her.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.813
- Let me guess.

04:05.879 --> 04:10.117
Your sick orphans
have a bad case of the Phage?

04:10.183 --> 04:12.786
- Why yes.
How did you know?

04:12.853 --> 04:17.325
- Out of all the sectors...

04:17.391 --> 04:18.492
- Dal?

04:18.559 --> 04:21.629
- You two-bit, crooked-tooth,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.997
no-good Ferengi!

04:24.064 --> 04:27.468
- Dal, you worthless scamp!
Holo-emitters off.

04:27.535 --> 04:31.905
Get your ship over here.
Pik-Pox will beam you aboard.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.874
- Target the "Damsel's"
location.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.744
Crew, I want you
to meet DaiMon Nandi...

04:36.810 --> 04:38.779
the captain who raised me.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.414
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh...

04:40.481 --> 04:41.915
- Uh--hi?

04:41.982 --> 04:44.184
- Don't really see
the resemblance.

04:44.251 --> 04:47.187
[sedate music]

04:47.254 --> 04:51.124
* *

04:56.397 --> 04:58.399
- [sighs]
- Ah! Ah!

04:58.466 --> 05:01.068
Oh, please, let everything be
in the right place.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.340
- It's good to be back.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.309
[gentle music]

05:09.377 --> 05:11.278
* *

05:11.345 --> 05:13.347
- [laughs]

05:13.414 --> 05:16.850
Welcome to the "Damsel"!

05:16.917 --> 05:18.285
I wouldn't touch that.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.823
Oh, my lobeling,

05:22.890 --> 05:26.126
I never forgave myself
for losing you.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.762
I searched for years.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.063
- I missed you too.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.901
- Oh, how I've missed you!
You're alive!

05:34.902 --> 05:38.171
And--you joined the Federation?

05:38.238 --> 05:39.440
- I stole it.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.709
- I taught you well!

05:41.775 --> 05:45.345
I even kept your room
just as it was.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.180
- Ah!
- Oh!

05:50.117 --> 05:53.521
- You slept under the engine?

05:53.587 --> 05:54.988
- What a dump!

05:55.055 --> 05:57.124
- All the stories
you would tell me...

05:57.190 --> 05:59.226
This is where you saw it from?

05:59.292 --> 06:03.797
The battles, the planets,
the Window of Dreams?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.799
- [laughs nervously]

06:05.866 --> 06:10.871
- Ahh, what is
this contraption?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.706
- Ooh, it looks powerful.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.675
- It's a cloaking device.

06:14.742 --> 06:18.679
- Ooh.
- Oh, she reads Klingon?

06:18.746 --> 06:21.348
A girl like that can be useful!

06:21.415 --> 06:24.117
- Cloaking?
It can make a ship invisible?

06:24.184 --> 06:26.420
- Too bad it doesn't work
without chimerium.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.321
It's impossible
to get your hands on.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.459
- Chimerium?
We have loads of that!

06:31.525 --> 06:36.530
If we're invisible,
we can hide from you-know-who!

06:36.864 --> 06:38.666
- Chimerium?
Pfft.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.333
Who said we have chimerium?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.937
- Rok did, just now.
Jeez, this guy.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.107
- We should talk.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.210
- Oh, my lobes are tingling
with opportunity.

06:52.813 --> 06:56.283
So you have a connection
to some chimerium?

06:56.349 --> 06:57.384
Who's your source?

06:57.451 --> 06:59.186
- Uh-uh-uh.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.155
Ferengi Rule of Acquisition
number 208.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.891
- "Sometimes the only thing
more dangerous

07:03.957 --> 07:06.359
than a question is an answer."

07:06.426 --> 07:08.028
You have my attention.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.330
Okay.
You want the cloaking device.

07:10.397 --> 07:13.701
I'll give it to you
if your crew does a job for me.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.537
A Federation ship
can open a lot of doors.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.971
- What's the job?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.239
- [speaks alien language]

07:19.306 --> 07:22.342
- A planet
in the Skeralyx System.

07:22.409 --> 07:27.047
An advanced civilization
that has never met alien life,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.983
with loads
of remalite crystals.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.620
Too many to handle,
in my humble opinion.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.054
I just need one.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.089
- How does one crystal
benefit you?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.558
- Ugh, I owe a hefty debt

07:37.625 --> 07:40.728
after a losing streak
at the dabo tables.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.063
- I thought
you were done with that.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.432
- I owe a lot, Dal.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.569
If I don't get them
that crystal--

07:48.636 --> 07:49.837
- I don't know, Nandi.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.040
- It's just
a diplomatic exchange.

07:53.106 --> 07:56.844
A crystal for a-a--

07:56.910 --> 07:59.246
- Really?
A Ferengi spit pan?

07:59.312 --> 08:01.314
- Not only will they meet life
from other planets,

08:01.381 --> 08:05.919
but a gift of precious metal
from outer space?

08:07.487 --> 08:11.424
And your crew is in desperate
need of a cloaking device.

08:11.491 --> 08:15.395
Let me guess: you got them
into some hot water?

08:15.462 --> 08:18.231
[uneasy music]

08:18.298 --> 08:21.835
- It's a diplomatic exchange.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.338
- We'd be the first people
from outer space to meet them?

08:25.405 --> 08:27.775
- I'd be the first person
to communicate with them?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.076
- They're not gonna know

08:29.142 --> 08:31.579
what to do
with all this handsome.

08:31.645 --> 08:35.448
- Curiously, Dal doesn't share
our excitement.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.117
I sense hesitation.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.418
- Why would you think that?

08:38.485 --> 08:40.353
I'm not hesitating.
Who's hesitating?

08:40.420 --> 08:42.022
- You should be.

08:42.089 --> 08:45.693
We need to have a serious talk
about first contact.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.128
- Ugh, where's her off switch?

08:48.195 --> 08:51.098
- Starfleet's Prime Directive
is to avoid interfering

08:51.164 --> 08:54.234
in the evolution
of other intelligent species.

08:54.301 --> 08:58.105
These are the highest priority
guidelines Starfleet abides by.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.440
I cannot stress enough
that failure to adhere

09:00.507 --> 09:03.476
to these rules could have
disastrous consequences

09:03.543 --> 09:05.779
altering the fate
of this civilization.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.115
- We'll be careful
not to interfere

09:08.181 --> 09:10.417
in their develop-lution.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.053
- What about uniforms?
To look the part.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.956
- We are representing
the Federation.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.257
- We don't need
to be that formal.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.426
Let's just do this and get out.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.895
- Okay, fine.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.064
- Your thoughts are conflicted.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.099
- You feel we need
the cloaking device,

09:26.166 --> 09:29.069
yet I sense you question
her motives.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.539
- I trust her.
She's a friend.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.115
[wondrous music]

09:42.182 --> 09:49.122
* *

10:03.704 --> 10:07.574
- Huh, how curious.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.445
- Pik-Pox's intel is good.

10:12.512 --> 10:15.315
- Oh.
No, that's strange.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.950
According to my readings,

10:17.017 --> 10:19.787
there are lifeforms
all around us.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.189
- [gasps]
Maybe they're invisible!

10:22.255 --> 10:23.556
[resonating sound]

10:23.623 --> 10:25.158
Do you hear that?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.598
Whoa!
Uh, what's happening?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.867
- Uh, the sand is dancing.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.236
- What are these murmurations?

10:36.303 --> 10:38.939
- They're communicating.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.473
- What are they trying to say?

10:40.540 --> 10:41.541
- Don't ask me.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.544
She's the communications
officer.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.614
- Something's definitely wrong.
Zero?

10:47.681 --> 10:49.349
- No, I can't read
their thoughts,

10:49.416 --> 10:51.151
but they seem upset.

10:51.218 --> 10:53.553
- I got that much.
- Do something!

10:53.620 --> 10:55.856
- Why are they mad at us?
- I don't know.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.959
Translators aren't working.
What's happening?

10:59.026 --> 11:02.095
- We're in big trouble now.
- Make it stop.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.230
- It's the hair!

11:03.296 --> 11:06.066
This is not
a good first impression!

11:06.133 --> 11:08.335
- It's murder planet
all over again.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.304
[suspenseful music]

11:11.371 --> 11:18.178
* *

11:18.245 --> 11:21.281
- Stand back!

11:21.348 --> 11:23.083
- I think they are angry.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.285
- They must think we are here
to hurt them.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.188
- I don't like this place!
- That isn't helping!

11:28.255 --> 11:29.723
- Everyone, bow.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.726
Look submissive.
Show we're not a threat.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.198
- We're trusting you.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.837
- My body's telling me
this ain't working.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.606
- Of course,
they're using harmonics.

11:47.741 --> 11:51.011
An electrical, uh, frequency
or tone.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.784
Quick, calibrate your
tricorders off this frequency.

11:56.850 --> 12:03.991
* *

12:08.295 --> 12:10.263
- Huh?

12:10.330 --> 12:13.233
[gentle chiming]

12:13.300 --> 12:15.668
* *

12:15.735 --> 12:16.970
- What's happening?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.172
- The ground...
Can you feel it?

12:19.239 --> 12:24.544
* *

12:24.611 --> 12:27.514
[wondrous music]

12:27.580 --> 12:31.584
* *

12:31.651 --> 12:35.122
- Wow, wow, wow.

12:35.188 --> 12:40.160
* *

12:40.227 --> 12:42.729
- I think they want us
to enter.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.200
- I could've translated that.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.369
- Captain,
send out the warning.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.371
We are being boarded.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.273
- Computer, pause.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.276
[mysterious music]

12:56.343 --> 12:59.646
* *

12:59.712 --> 13:03.851
Computer, frame 245 on screen.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.685
200% magnification.

13:05.752 --> 13:10.323
* *

13:10.390 --> 13:12.225
Who are you?

13:12.292 --> 13:17.164
* *

13:17.230 --> 13:20.100
- They truly are
an advanced species.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.070
Look, the symmetry
and designs suggest

13:23.136 --> 13:25.472
strong mathematical knowledge.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.774
- How is this possible?

13:27.841 --> 13:31.111
- Cymatic transmutation.
By changing the pitch,

13:31.178 --> 13:34.181
they create sound waves
that can shape matter.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.315
- Hmm?

13:35.382 --> 13:36.749
- Acoustic terra-molding.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.518
- Cymatics?

13:38.585 --> 13:42.155
Maybe we should--we should
call them the Cymari.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.224
- We can call them
anything they like

13:44.291 --> 13:47.260
as long as I get
that crystal, okay?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.032
- Hmm?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.601
Again with the walls?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.237
- Ah!

13:57.304 --> 13:58.471
- Aw...

13:58.538 --> 14:00.440
- It's getting bigger!
- What is that?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.542
- Whoa!
all: Whoa!

14:02.609 --> 14:04.978
- We're gonna die!

14:08.348 --> 14:11.351
- Ah, man.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.553
Where are we?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.655
- I can't see anything.

14:15.722 --> 14:18.758
- Why is it so quiet?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.664
[crystal chimes]

14:24.731 --> 14:27.200
[crystals gently resonating]

14:30.403 --> 14:32.739
[gentle ringing melody]

14:32.805 --> 14:38.345
* *

14:38.411 --> 14:40.880
all: Whoa!

14:40.948 --> 14:42.983
* *

14:43.050 --> 14:44.985
- Remalite crystals.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.887
- They're beautiful.

14:47.955 --> 14:55.095
* *

15:12.612 --> 15:16.649
- Each crystal is emitting
a unique frequency.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.053
That's how they're achieving
harmonic resonance.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.321
- The crystals must be

15:21.388 --> 15:24.157
the power source
of their cymatic abilities.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.094
They need them
to transform matter.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.997
Every crystal matters.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.298
- We shouldn't be here.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.434
- Don't be ridiculous!
We came to make a trade!

15:39.106 --> 15:44.844
I present you precious metals
from the stars!

15:44.911 --> 15:52.019
* *

15:57.690 --> 16:01.528
Now you give us a gift.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.599
Hmm.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.900
- [gasps]

16:07.967 --> 16:10.903
[ethereal music]

16:10.970 --> 16:18.111
* *

16:28.055 --> 16:30.257
- It's magnificent.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.193
- This is the greatest gift.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.995
- Ugh.
It's the most horrible thing

16:36.063 --> 16:38.331
Jankom's ever heard.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.100
- A song?

16:40.167 --> 16:42.869
We want a crystal!
Give it to me!

16:42.935 --> 16:44.271
[all gasp]

16:44.337 --> 16:46.439
[discordant reverberation]

16:46.506 --> 16:47.940
- They're in pain!

16:48.007 --> 16:50.943
[ominous music]

16:51.010 --> 16:52.579
* *

16:52.645 --> 16:56.015
- This isn't what we agreed to.
- Agreed to?

16:56.083 --> 16:58.651
You said this would be
a diplomatic exchange.

16:58.718 --> 17:00.053
- Did you lie to us?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.189
- Rule of Acquisition
number 21.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.391
"Never place friendship
above profit."

17:04.457 --> 17:06.893
[ground rumbling]

17:06.959 --> 17:09.096
all: Oh!

17:09.162 --> 17:13.766
* *

17:13.833 --> 17:15.835
- These don't belong to you!

17:15.902 --> 17:18.071
- The job isn't done!

17:18.138 --> 17:25.245
* *

17:33.086 --> 17:34.154
- Let's go!
We got to get out of here!

17:34.221 --> 17:35.222
- Dal, what do we do?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.556
- This isn't good!

17:36.623 --> 17:40.260
- We have to get
the crystals back.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.230
[dramatic music]

17:43.296 --> 17:45.998
* *

17:46.065 --> 17:49.669
- I'm so sorry!
Please, forgive us!

17:49.736 --> 17:52.105
- Nandi has the last crystal.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.440
- We gotta go.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.308
This whole place
is coming down!

17:55.375 --> 17:57.110
[all yelling]

17:57.177 --> 18:04.083
* *

18:07.420 --> 18:08.588
- Which way?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.390
- There! There!
Go! Go! Go!

18:10.457 --> 18:12.392
* *

18:12.459 --> 18:13.793
- Look for an exit.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.595
- Yes! Yes, hurry!
- Gotta go! Come on!

18:15.662 --> 18:17.397
- You don't have
to tell Jankom twice!

18:17.464 --> 18:24.504
* *

18:24.837 --> 18:27.274
- [yells]
- Ah!

18:27.340 --> 18:30.810
* *

18:30.877 --> 18:32.812
- Please!
We have to give it back!

18:32.879 --> 18:34.347
- Rule of Acquisition
number one,

18:34.414 --> 18:38.050
"Once you have their money,
never give it back"!

18:38.117 --> 18:42.955
Let go!
- It doesn't belong to you!

18:43.022 --> 18:46.926
- You weak, lobeless fool!
You're too soft!

18:46.993 --> 18:49.729
Not even working the mines
hardened you up!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.664
- How would you know
I was in the mines?

18:51.731 --> 18:54.601
- [growls]
- Ah!

18:54.667 --> 18:57.437
You couldn't know.
They kidnapped me.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.372
- Kidnapped? Ha!

18:59.439 --> 19:01.941
I sold you and bought a partner

19:02.008 --> 19:04.177
with an actual eye
for treasure.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.447
Pik-Pox doesn't have the mouth
to muck it up!

19:07.514 --> 19:14.687
* *

19:15.288 --> 19:19.292
- Your ship can cloak?
You stole our chimerium!

19:19.359 --> 19:20.427
- Stole?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.495
Your shields were down,

19:22.562 --> 19:24.531
so I consider it a gift.

19:24.597 --> 19:26.299
- Did you even need our help?

19:26.366 --> 19:29.202
Did you really lose
at the dabo tables,

19:29.269 --> 19:31.371
or was all of this
just another con?

19:31.438 --> 19:32.605
- I needed the crystal,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.073
but when you dropped
into my lap,

19:34.140 --> 19:37.877
I saw a way to get it
and cloak my ship too.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.447
You shouldn't be
feeling sorry for yourself.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.382
You should be taking notes!

19:42.449 --> 19:45.418
Aw, don't look so grim, my boy.

19:45.485 --> 19:49.356
We'll cross paths again
one day.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.359
[somber music]

19:52.425 --> 19:59.332
* *

20:04.371 --> 20:06.639
- I'm sorry.

20:06.706 --> 20:13.846
* *

20:18.318 --> 20:19.719
- You got him!

20:19.786 --> 20:20.887
- No thanks to Dal!

20:20.953 --> 20:22.188
The dumb-dumb lost
his combadge,

20:22.255 --> 20:24.056
so Jankom had to lock on
without it!

20:24.123 --> 20:26.659
You're welcome!
- But where's the crystal?

20:26.726 --> 20:29.329
- I didn't lose the combadge.
I used it.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.464
- He put his combadge
on the crystal

20:31.531 --> 20:36.836
so we can beam it back!

20:36.903 --> 20:38.805
- Get out of my face!

20:38.871 --> 20:41.808
[soft music]

20:41.874 --> 20:46.746
* *

20:46.813 --> 20:49.516
[gasps] No! I need that!

20:49.582 --> 20:52.785
No!
No, no, no! No!

20:55.121 --> 20:58.057
[ethereal music]

20:58.124 --> 21:04.864
* *

21:04.931 --> 21:06.566
- Well, that's done.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.000
- That was way too close.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.903
- No more diplomatic exchanges
for me, thank you.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.140
- At least we fixed it, right?

21:14.206 --> 21:15.908
- [sighs]

21:15.975 --> 21:17.510
- Fixed it?

21:17.577 --> 21:20.146
You've done irreparable harm
to this species.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.549
- But we gave
the crystals back.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.684
- That doesn't change the fact
that their first brush

21:24.751 --> 21:28.220
with alien life tried
to take advantage of them.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.590
You broke the Prime Directive.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.426
You didn't even go in
with good intentions.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.396
You acted for yourselves,
not Starfleet.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.799
You broke their trust
and mine.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.569
- I-I messed up.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.836
- Ugh.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.038
- I don't like
getting into trouble.

21:46.105 --> 21:49.075
- You did what you could.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.511
- How could Nandi
do that to me?

21:51.578 --> 21:52.912
I was like a son to her.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.115
- And I was
my father's daughter,

21:56.182 --> 21:57.417
but here we are.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.818
- I'm sorry.
I--

21:58.885 --> 22:01.421
I--because of me,

22:01.488 --> 22:05.057
we lost the cloaking device
and the chimerium.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.360
- But you learned
who your true friends are.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.596
The ones willing to go along
with you,

22:09.662 --> 22:11.598
no matter how foolish it seems.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.000
Never take that for granted.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.836
I wish I could tell you
it'll stop hurting,

22:16.903 --> 22:18.705
but I don't know that yet.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.708
[downbeat music]

22:21.774 --> 22:28.347
* *

22:28.415 --> 22:31.884
- [grunts]

22:31.951 --> 22:33.720
- [speaking alien language]

22:33.786 --> 22:35.455
- You heard what?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.256
- [speaking alien language]

22:37.323 --> 22:41.327
- A reward for information
on the "Protostar"?

22:41.394 --> 22:44.797
Don't just hover!
Open a channel to the REV-12!

22:44.864 --> 22:47.967
I want to speak
to this Diviner.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.504
My lobes are tingling
with opportunity.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.205
[laughs]
