00:09.300 --> 00:11.011
Lord, have mercy on us.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.304
Christ, have mercy on us.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.349
Lord, have mercy on us.
Christ, hear us.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.685
Christ, graciously hear us.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.854
God, the Father in heaven.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.981
Have mercy on us.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.816
God, the Holy Ghost.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.860
Have mercy on us.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.070
The Holy Trinity, one God.

00:29.529 --> 00:30.780
Have mercy on us.

00:44.502 --> 00:45.378
Good night, Joe.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.421
Good night, Father.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.703
Dennis, your minute steak's getting cold.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.705
Confession went late.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.667
Agnes Samson thought about stealing
her sister's watch.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.545
Took a good ten minutes to convince her
that wasn't a sin.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.049
Well, Dennis, this is Father Adeyemi.

01:31.132 --> 01:33.134
Visiting the archdiocese from Nigeria.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.594
My pleasure. Welcome to California.

01:34.677 --> 01:35.678
Ah, thank you.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.888
Eat up, McMurtry.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.890
<i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>
is playing at the Westmont.

01:38.973 --> 01:39.808
Ah.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.476
Will you be joining us, Father McMurtry?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.522
I'll stay in tonight, thanks.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.441
It's been raining pretty hard, and
I think I'm coming down with something.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.526
Suit yourself.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.914
Hello, ladies.

02:39.159 --> 02:39.993
Hi.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.120
Can I help you?

02:42.203 --> 02:43.037
Sorry to bother you.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.665
My car broke down up the road,
and it's getting cold out.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.459
I hate to ask,
but I wonder if I could use your phone?

02:49.169 --> 02:52.046
Oh, sure. Please, come in, dry off.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.173
Thank you very much.

02:57.719 --> 03:01.931
The… the telephone is in the parlor
if you'd like to call the garage.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.766
Can I make you a cup of coffee?

03:06.060 --> 03:07.270
That'd be nice. Thanks.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.899
Where are you coming from?

03:11.816 --> 03:12.901
Oh…

03:12.984 --> 03:14.277
All over, I guess.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.036
You're welcome to that, if you're hungry.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.290
I'll eat it later.

03:27.790 --> 03:31.377
Fantastic. Just fantastic, Monsignor.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.796
That was magical.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.048
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.218
Oh, boy.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.054
I'll put on some coffee, warm us up.

03:41.846 --> 03:42.764
Thank you.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.477
That's probably a new experience.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.898
Yes. She is magnificent.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.954
-Sleep well.
-Thank you, Monsignor.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.830
-Glad you enjoyed it.
-Good night.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.167
-Good night.
-Thanks again, Monsignor.

05:13.104 --> 05:13.980
What's going on?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.659
No! No!

05:27.744 --> 05:28.953
-No!

05:45.887 --> 05:47.263
Hello, Monsignor.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.434
Sister Margaret McGuire,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.227
you remember her?

05:55.021 --> 05:56.189
She was my mother.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.069
You're my dad, Monsignor.

06:01.152 --> 06:01.986
That's…

06:03.571 --> 06:04.655
that's nonsense.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.298
All right, all right, I knew her.

06:23.591 --> 06:27.512
W… we did things together,
but she wanted it.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.222
She ended up in a whore house.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.725
One of them shot her up with morphine…

06:32.809 --> 06:34.977
- Please forgive me!
-…and it killed her.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.188
And I got sent to an orphanage.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.148
Look, you've got to understand.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.194
I'm a sinner.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.072
I've suffered for my sins.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.284
No, no, no, no, no.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.374
Now you're gonna suffer.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.172
Here's that map you asked for, ma'am.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.173
Thank you.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.051
May I ask why
you're headed to Lucia?

07:49.135 --> 07:52.138
It seems like a rather personal question,
now, doesn't it?

07:52.221 --> 07:53.181
Sorry.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.520
Clearly your tumescence
has distracted you, sir.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.856
I recall asking for today's local paper.

08:01.939 --> 08:02.857
Oh! Sorry.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.734
Here you go.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.905
Yeah, it's big news around here.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.781
Everybody's up in arms.

08:10.865 --> 08:14.202
Fella cuts up a bunch of priests
and they ship him up to Lucia?

08:16.662 --> 08:18.539
Hey, that's where you're headed.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.167
You're not some sort of journalist
or something, are you?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.668
You should bathe more often.

08:23.461 --> 08:24.712
Your fingernails are filthy.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.518
What do I owe the pleasure?

10:04.937 --> 10:06.063
I have a reservation.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.362
What's the name?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.949
Ratched. Mildred Ratched.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.623
Vultures, all of them.

10:24.165 --> 10:27.084
<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> is offering $5,000

10:27.168 --> 10:29.754
to whoever gets the first shot
of the Clergy Killer.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.882
You're not a vulture, are you?

10:32.965 --> 10:33.966
No, ma'am.

10:34.383 --> 10:35.343
I'm a nurse.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.890
Ice machine's at the end
in the interior of the breezeway.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.602
We provide that machine as a courtesy,

10:44.685 --> 10:48.397
so I wouldn't abuse that privilege
if I were you.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.732
I pay very close attention

10:49.815 --> 10:53.694
to how much ice is in that machine
at any given time.

10:55.529 --> 10:56.781
God damn it.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.785
May I offer help with the key?

11:04.872 --> 11:08.668
Not much to look at,
but we've got a phone in the office.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.794
Thank you.

11:20.805 --> 11:24.183
And just so you know, if you happen
to have any gentlemen callers,

11:24.266 --> 11:26.227
I'm going to know about it.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.438
And I do not run a house of ill repute.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.606
Do you understand me?

11:54.213 --> 11:57.299
<i>Hello, I'm here to speak with Dr. Hanover.</i>

12:00.177 --> 12:02.012
<i>It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.</i>

12:02.596 --> 12:04.306
<i>Sir, it is a pleasure to meet you.</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:13.274
<i>I have come quite a long way</i>
<i>and would just like to speak with him.</i>

12:21.907 --> 12:23.659
Priest killer must die!

12:27.580 --> 12:29.999
I have an appointment. Thank you.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.594
Can I help you?

13:23.677 --> 13:26.180
Hello. I'm here to speak with Dr. Hanover.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.849
I'm sorry, darlin'.
He's not talking to press right now.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.061
Oh, I'm not the press.
I'm the new night shift nurse.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.397
Dr. Hanover hasn't technically
hired me yet,

13:35.481 --> 13:38.984
but I'm supposed to have
a formal interview with him at 11:00,

13:39.068 --> 13:40.694
as this letter clearly states.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.948
Okay, one second.
I'm just gonna go get a nurse.

13:44.031 --> 13:45.241
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.076
You aren't a nurse?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.160
Me? No.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.329
I'm a nurse trainee.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.748
I admire nurses more than anything.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.333
They really are God's angels.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.418
Yes. Yes, we are.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.754
Okay, be right back.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.438
Hiya.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.526
Have a nice day.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.704
My preliminary recommendation is this:

14:32.663 --> 14:38.544
that if Mr. Salvatore wants the board
to seriously consider a furlough,

14:38.627 --> 14:42.464
he must continue with
Dr. Hanover's regimen of colonics,

14:42.548 --> 14:45.217
he must attend group therapy
three times daily,

14:45.301 --> 14:48.262
and he must take his saltpeter tablets
as prescribed.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.388
Am I understood?

14:49.471 --> 14:50.723
<i>Si. Si.</i>

14:50.806 --> 14:51.765
Nurse Bucket?

14:51.849 --> 14:53.475
You're needed at nurse's station one.

14:55.686 --> 14:56.520
Excuse me.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.690
There's a letter.

15:00.149 --> 15:00.983
Oh.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.199
Where did you get this?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.119
You must be the head nurse.

15:13.162 --> 15:13.996
Mildred Ratched.

15:14.079 --> 15:15.915
I didn't ask what your name was.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.458
Where did you get the letter?

15:17.541 --> 15:18.709
Why, it was sent to me.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.377
That's where I'm confused,

15:20.461 --> 15:24.757
because there is no one in his office
except for Dr. Hanover and myself.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.091
I didn't send that.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.929
And I can assure you,
that isn't Dr. Hanover's signature.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.973
I have come quite a long way
and would just like to speak with him.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.352
Dr. Hanover is out of the office
till later this afternoon.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.937
If you'd like to leave a number--

15:38.020 --> 15:40.105
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to wait here.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.359
He'll be gone some time.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.235
You just said
he'd return in the afternoon.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.320
It could be longer.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.030
Well, then it could be shorter.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.324
By your own logic.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.577
I truly don't mind waiting.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.579
I have nowhere else to be.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.584
Very well.

16:22.564 --> 16:24.692
- I'm sorry, Dr. Hanover.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.777
The governor's going
to have to reschedule.

16:26.860 --> 16:27.736
Maybe next month.

16:35.786 --> 16:36.620
Another?

16:37.287 --> 16:39.832
No, thank you. Got a long journey back.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.561
Um…

17:00.644 --> 17:01.812
…on second thought…

17:16.869 --> 17:17.870
Good afternoon.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.622
Good afternoon, Governor.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.167
I have your booth in the back for you.
Right this way.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.424
<i>Excuse me, Gov. Wilburn.</i>

17:30.507 --> 17:31.550
Dr. Richard Hanover.

17:31.633 --> 17:33.719
-I know who you are.
-We had a meeting scheduled today.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.388
You're the guy who runs the loony bin
in Lucia.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.808
I prefer the term
"psychiatric rehabilitation facility."

17:39.892 --> 17:43.562
We had a similar meeting scheduled
last month, and the month before that.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.648
Maybe we should hear him out.

17:46.732 --> 17:49.443
Tell you what, I'll give you until
the moment our drinks are delivered

17:49.526 --> 17:50.694
for you to give me your pitch.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.446
Excuse me, do you mind?

17:52.529 --> 17:53.864
I didn't invite you to sit.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.699
You see, Governor,
I don't run a loony bin.

17:55.783 --> 18:00.037
My hospital is a bastion of recovery
and rehabilitation unlike any other.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.915
Now, as for the funding,
I'm currently constructing a barn

18:02.998 --> 18:05.459
to be used in various
therapeutic regimens.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.836
-And people are--
-And… time's up.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.800
We can maybe meet again
in a month or so, or…

18:22.893 --> 18:24.228
Thank you for your time, Governor.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.145
Yeah.

18:35.322 --> 18:36.198
Interesting.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.290
Looking good today, Miss Dolly.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.416
Thanks, Harold.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.918
Whatcha up to?

18:48.293 --> 18:49.586
Just making my rounds.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.894
Excuse me.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.063
Where can I find your restroom?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.857
Down the hall to the left.

19:11.066 --> 19:11.942
Thank you.

19:12.025 --> 19:12.860
You're welcome.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.940
Looking good today, Mildred.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.062
Is there something specific
you needed, Nurse Bucket?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.563
I'm afraid there's a woman here.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.066
She says she has a job interview with you.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.901
I didn't agree to any such thing.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.403
Get rid of her, please.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.822
I tried, she's very insistent.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.085
I'll take care of it.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.726
You. Are you the one who's here
for the interview?

21:50.809 --> 21:54.187
Yes, an interview that was
supposed to start several hours ago.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.857
Forgive me, Dr. Hanover,
I know your work is very important.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.567
But I, too, value my time.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.403
But I suppose if you were willing
to conduct the interview right now,

22:01.486 --> 22:03.780
I could try my best
to look past the insult.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.032
Your office is this way?

22:05.115 --> 22:07.034
Uh, yeah. Right this way.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.915
I apologize for the mix-up.

22:14.499 --> 22:18.503
If I'm being honest, I don't recall
consenting to any sort of an interview.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.339
That's quite all right, Doctor.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.550
With a nursing staff as unexceptional
as the one you have,

22:23.633 --> 22:25.969
certain clerical errors
are bound to happen.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.347
Nurse Bucket, a moment, please.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.858
Please, take a seat.

22:42.527 --> 22:46.031
I hope it's not inappropriate,
Doctor, to confess something,

22:46.114 --> 22:48.408
but I was a nurse in the Pacific theater
during the war.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.993
Where exactly were you stationed?

22:50.077 --> 22:52.996
I island-hopped
with Admiral Nimitz's boys,

22:53.080 --> 22:56.041
from Tarawa, to Saipan, to Okinawa.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.128
You'll see that's where I became familiar
with administering anesthetics.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.506
I'm well versed
in all the blood derivatives,

23:02.589 --> 23:05.258
oxygen therapy, and, of course,
the treatment of shock.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.053
Do you have scat throwers here?

23:09.721 --> 23:12.015
Patients who throw their feces?

23:13.141 --> 23:15.268
Oh, yes. In fact, we do.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
Well, that won't faze me.

23:18.438 --> 23:22.901
I've encountered many cases
of soldiers with battle fatigue,

23:22.984 --> 23:24.653
who lost their wits entirely.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.323
Men who would try to rape a woman
if they could get a hold of her,

23:28.407 --> 23:31.535
and when they couldn't, would content
themselves by throwing excrement…

23:32.035 --> 23:32.994
ejaculate...

23:37.958 --> 23:39.751
But I was not deterred, Doctor.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.294
In fact, I was invigorated…

23:42.212 --> 23:46.049
because I was a member of the most
unsung profession we have in this country.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.552
We had a saying in the Corps,

23:48.635 --> 23:50.929
"Save one life, and you're a hero."

23:51.555 --> 23:52.973
"Save 100 lives…

23:54.433 --> 23:56.226
…well, then you're a nurse."

23:57.394 --> 24:00.105
I must say you're a very impressive woman,
Miss Ratched.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.023
And clearly passionate.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.944
-But unfortunately--
-May I venture one last query, Doctor?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.615
Do you believe
the human mind can be cured?

24:12.033 --> 24:12.868
I do.

24:14.411 --> 24:15.912
But it's not about belief.

24:16.538 --> 24:17.998
It requires no act of faith.

24:18.081 --> 24:20.125
I've seen it with my own eyes.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.376
I have not.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.006
But I hope you'll believe me
when I tell you

24:26.089 --> 24:29.050
it is all I want in the world.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.181
Miss Ratched, you're…

24:35.474 --> 24:38.435
one of the more interesting women
I've had the pleasure of meeting,

24:39.811 --> 24:43.064
but I'm sad to say that until I can secure
more funding from the state,

24:43.148 --> 24:45.609
I simply don't have the resources
to bring you on.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.235
I'm sorry.

24:47.986 --> 24:51.490
But when there is an opening,
please trust that I will consider you.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.576
Well…

24:57.120 --> 24:59.748
if there's one thing I've learned,
Doctor…

25:02.000 --> 25:04.419
it's that life can be quite unpredictable.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.712
Thank you for your time.

25:13.261 --> 25:17.224
The sheets were not ironed
correctly, the bedpans were a disgrace,

25:17.307 --> 25:19.142
and Amelia, too much smiling.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.270
I mean, could we have less teeth
and more work?

25:23.730 --> 25:25.190
Thank you all for your help.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.820
And the towels,
were they folded by the blind?

26:06.147 --> 26:07.023
Come on.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.360
Hello.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.029
I'm looking for Amelia Emerson.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.448
She's not home,
and I'm about to head out on a sales call.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.700
Something I can help you with?

26:16.783 --> 26:19.744
Oh, I'm just an old high school friend
passing through town.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.163
Maybe you could give her a message?

26:22.539 --> 26:23.665
What was your name?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.626
Arlene. Arlene Bauer.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.880
<i>The question is, is this</i>
<i>an attempt at avoiding the death penalty,</i>

26:30.964 --> 26:33.091
<i>or is Edmund Tolleson really crazy?</i>

26:33.174 --> 26:35.385
<i>He's being transported</i>
<i>from San Quentin Prison </i>

26:35.468 --> 26:36.970
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

26:37.053 --> 26:39.556
<i>Law enforcement is keeping</i>
<i>some of the details under wraps,</i>

26:39.639 --> 26:42.434
<i>but word is that one of the victims</i>
<i>was almost beheaded.</i>

26:42.601 --> 26:45.437
<i>That concludes our special report</i>
<i>on the Clergy Killer.</i>

26:45.520 --> 26:47.522
<i>-And now…</i>
-Do you think you could do me a favor?

26:47.606 --> 26:51.443
This killer gives me the chills,
and I'm not talking Bela Lugosi chills.

26:51.526 --> 26:55.405
Although, I'd sell my soul
for a date with him.

26:55.488 --> 26:59.909
I'd let him sink his teeth into me
and suck me dry

26:59.993 --> 27:02.579
as if he really were Count Dracula.

27:02.662 --> 27:03.705
If you could just do--

27:03.788 --> 27:06.875
I read all these papers,
and none of them describe

27:06.958 --> 27:11.087
what this Edmund fella actually did
to those priests.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.637
Now, what favor can I do for you?

27:19.095 --> 27:23.391
If anyone calls asking for Arlene Bauer,
could you let me know?

27:24.559 --> 27:27.020
It's a little joke
between me and an old friend.

27:27.687 --> 27:31.274
And is Arlene Bauer paying
for another night's room,

27:31.358 --> 27:33.151
or are you two splitting the bill?

27:54.047 --> 27:56.633
A smile like that could melt ice.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.677
So I've been told.

27:59.135 --> 28:00.428
Well, I don't like it.

28:01.262 --> 28:05.016
A lady in my position could go so far
as to say you're leering.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.395
A gentleman in my position can't help it

28:08.478 --> 28:10.897
when he's staring at a beautiful woman
like yourself.

28:55.358 --> 28:56.985
No, I'm not married.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.179
I've never done this before.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.977
Do you think we could just sit?

29:40.862 --> 29:42.781
Actually, can you sit on that corner?

29:58.880 --> 29:59.964
So what do we do now?

30:04.969 --> 30:08.139
Let's pretend we're husband and wife
who've just had a fight.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.225
What was the fight about?

30:14.896 --> 30:15.772
Children.

30:16.731 --> 30:19.025
You want them, but I don't.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.446
I believe they're nothing but a burden,

30:23.530 --> 30:26.449
but you believe a family isn't a family
without them.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.084
What are you doing?

30:38.419 --> 30:39.546
So when do we make up?

30:41.881 --> 30:42.715
We don't.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.008
You leave.

30:52.141 --> 30:53.059
Why would I leave?

30:54.310 --> 30:55.311
Because…

30:57.480 --> 30:59.232
you'll think you're right,

31:00.275 --> 31:01.609
and I'll think I'm right.

31:03.027 --> 31:05.822
Then we'll both realize
it's not going to work.

31:07.448 --> 31:09.075
And then we'll get a divorce.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.829
Only to find soon after that I'm pregnant.

31:13.913 --> 31:16.416
And you will convince me to keep it.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.003
And then you'll die.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.217
I'll raise it for a few years
till I can't do it anymore,

31:26.509 --> 31:28.636
and then I will leave her on a doorstep.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.274
I'm sorry,
I don't see what the problem is.

31:47.530 --> 31:49.449
When you're ready,
you know where to find me.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.247
Is that all you got?

31:57.081 --> 31:58.082
Arlene Bauer,

31:58.166 --> 31:59.500
you have a phone call.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.699
You should take your coat off.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.284
It's warm in here.

32:33.368 --> 32:34.452
Do you need a drink?

32:36.913 --> 32:38.665
Walter is an excellent bartender.

32:39.165 --> 32:41.793
Look, I don't know what you think you saw.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.462
Oh, I know what I saw.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.509
What is it you want?

32:49.842 --> 32:50.677
Your job.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.596
And since there aren't
any positions available,

32:53.680 --> 32:57.642
I have been forced to create one myself.

32:57.725 --> 33:00.144
What makes you think
my husband will believe you?

33:02.855 --> 33:04.732
And what am I supposed to tell him?

33:04.816 --> 33:07.026
Tell him this town is poison…

33:08.653 --> 33:11.614
and that you want to get
as far away from it as possible.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.848
For your daughter.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.444
<i>How would you feel about your hospital</i>

33:49.527 --> 33:53.114
<i>being the cornerstone</i>
<i>of the governor's reelection campaign?</i>

33:53.197 --> 33:55.450
What is there to say? I'm…<i> </i>

33:55.533 --> 33:56.659
I'm speechless.

33:56.743 --> 33:57.994
Your facility,

33:59.078 --> 34:01.039
your bold new ideas,

34:01.497 --> 34:02.999
their proven results,

34:03.624 --> 34:08.296
this will force voters to see the governor
in a whole new light.

34:09.130 --> 34:13.801
Not as a musty old bureaucrat,
but as a forward-thinking progressive.

34:14.761 --> 34:20.975
A leader who can rehabilitate
a lost segment of the state workforce

34:21.059 --> 34:23.686
and move them back into the economy.

34:24.645 --> 34:30.026
I believe this will swing momentum
back to us…

34:31.569 --> 34:33.488
and the governor into his reelection.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.746
So, Doctor.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.249
What do you say?

34:46.709 --> 34:48.252
I can't believe it, sir.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.296
Our hospital. I mean, your hospital…

34:51.506 --> 34:53.883
…finally getting the recognition
it deserves.

34:53.966 --> 34:55.676
This is everything we've ever wanted.

34:55.760 --> 34:56.886
We have work to do.

34:56.969 --> 35:00.389
Nowhere do I want anything greater
than a ten-to-one patient-to-staff ratio.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.225
-Is that clear?
-That could be difficult, sir.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.644
Why is that difficult, Nurse Bucket?

35:04.727 --> 35:07.772
Well, sir, it's Amelia.
She hasn't shown up yet.

35:07.855 --> 35:08.856
What about Jackie?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.441
She's on vacation in Monterey.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.152
And who approved that? You, I imagine.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.446
Mm, Dr. Hanover, service came for you.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.633
Phone call. A Dr. Richard Hanover.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.200
This is a big day for all of us.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.995
Doctors, nurses, and low-level attendants.

36:04.078 --> 36:07.665
It is imperative
that we live up to the expectations

36:07.748 --> 36:09.500
that attracted Gov. Wilburn's attention.

36:10.501 --> 36:13.838
It is our moment to prove
why this hospital is so special.

36:15.923 --> 36:17.175
What are you doing here?

36:17.258 --> 36:18.092
Me?

36:18.467 --> 36:20.219
I'm… I'm just here to help.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.057
Mm.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.936
Every square inch of this facility
needs to be spotless.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.857
Every surface, I should be able to eat
runny eggs off of it.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.942
No!

36:35.443 --> 36:38.863
<i>Unruly patients</i>
<i>need to be humanely tamed…</i>

36:39.989 --> 36:40.948
<i>and tranquil.</i>

37:00.468 --> 37:03.429
And you must all perform your duties

37:03.512 --> 37:06.057
in the utmost
professional manner possible.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.433
Do I make myself clear?

37:07.516 --> 37:09.810
-Absolutely. Thank you so much.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.440
Good. Now let's get to it.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.902
- Governor!

37:49.475 --> 37:50.685
<i>Mio fratello…</i>

37:51.477 --> 37:52.478
<i> Mio fratello…</i>

37:52.561 --> 37:54.605
<i>voglio stare con te.</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:12.623
The new barn will become
the heartbeat of Lucia,

38:12.707 --> 38:15.626
using all the latest advances
in assisted therapy

38:15.710 --> 38:17.712
to calm even the most troubled mind

38:17.795 --> 38:20.881
before we even begin
administering a single medication.

38:20.965 --> 38:23.384
That's marvelous. That's wonderful!
Do you hear that, guys?

38:23.467 --> 38:24.302
Yes, sir.

38:24.385 --> 38:25.761
-Please, no.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.514
-I do not wish to be photographed.
-What about Edmund Tolleson?

38:28.597 --> 38:30.016
What precautions have you taken

38:30.099 --> 38:32.518
to ensure your patients'
and staff's safety when he arrives?

38:32.601 --> 38:34.687
-Where are you gonna chain him up?
-All right, come on.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.647
Well, we don't chain anyone up.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.149
He's a human being.

38:38.232 --> 38:41.444
But as for the logistical problems
of housing Mr. Tolleson,

38:41.527 --> 38:45.197
we found a solution that's both canny
and budget-conscious.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.284
As you may know,
this facility was formerly a rest spa.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.412
It actually has a wine cellar
deep underground.

38:51.495 --> 38:54.623
We've transformed that space
into a maximum-security holding area

38:54.707 --> 38:57.960
where Edmund will be housed
until he is evaluated.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.920
A wine cellar. Are you kidding me?

39:00.004 --> 39:00.838
Come on now.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.925
Edmund Tolleson is not the story
I brought you here to cover.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.802
It certainly isn't the one
you're going to run!

39:06.886 --> 39:07.970
Dr. Hanover!

39:08.679 --> 39:09.805
It's Father Murphy.

39:14.393 --> 39:17.104
Get me a blanket.
We need to make sure he stays warm.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.065
-What's going on?
-He collapsed.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.274
What are you doing?

39:20.358 --> 39:21.359
Don't touch him!

39:21.442 --> 39:23.402
Don't you ever lay a hand on me!

39:23.569 --> 39:24.779
How dare you!

39:25.279 --> 39:27.156
Just wait for it!

39:35.081 --> 39:37.666
There, there.
Keep breathing, keep breathing.

39:38.626 --> 39:39.752
Stay with us, Father.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.059
His blood pressure was dangerously low.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.685
The shock nearly killed him.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.522
Did you say shock?

40:01.982 --> 40:04.276
I think someone gave him
the wrong medication.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.738
Hey there, Mister. Gov. Wilburn,
how about a picture with me?

40:07.822 --> 40:09.824
-Come on. Let's go.
-Look this way, please.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.826
Look into the camera, there you go.
Big smile!

40:11.909 --> 40:12.910
What's wrong with him?

40:13.744 --> 40:17.331
They just told him that
his brother passed away, poor thing.

40:18.332 --> 40:20.167
Not that it would have mattered.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.838
He didn't know,
but he wasn't getting furloughed anyway.

40:24.213 --> 40:27.675
His nephew called,
said they didn't want him let out.

40:28.509 --> 40:29.427
Look here.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.845
Look up and smile.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.391
Miss Ratched,
would you come with me, please?

40:35.474 --> 40:37.435
Doctor. The governor would like a word--

40:37.518 --> 40:39.562
How is the patient? Did he pull through?

40:39.687 --> 40:40.521
Y-- yes.

40:40.604 --> 40:44.275
Fantastic. Look, I told the reporters
and the photographers to go upstairs.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.860
You'll be on one side of the bed,

40:45.943 --> 40:49.738
I'll be on the other,
handing you the check for $75,000.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.199
-The patient will be in the middle.
-Wha--

40:52.283 --> 40:53.451
I don't understand.

40:53.534 --> 40:57.872
Doctor, a dozen reporters just saw
a member of your staff save a man's life.

40:57.955 --> 41:00.207
Let's not discourage them
from putting that in the story,

41:00.291 --> 41:02.668
and let's make sure
they have a photo to go with that story.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.712
I told you, I don't do photographs.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.005
-We have--
-You're fine.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.300
She's the one that saved his life.
I choose her.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.596
All right, gentlemen,
one more shot and we're done.

41:13.679 --> 41:16.849
Great. Let's get one
with the two of us. Huh?

41:16.932 --> 41:18.976
Please don't put your hand on me
like that.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.060
Thank you.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.448
Well, I guess she works here now.

42:03.979 --> 42:05.523
Hello, Mr. Salvatore.

42:20.579 --> 42:22.289
I'm sorry about your brother.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.796
I know how you feel right now,

42:29.255 --> 42:30.839
not being able to be with him.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.011
Told that you're mad…

42:38.138 --> 42:40.182
when that's what's driving you mad.

42:42.017 --> 42:42.851
Isn't it?

42:46.897 --> 42:48.357
I know how that feels.

42:55.698 --> 42:56.615
I had a brother.

42:57.741 --> 43:00.035
He was the only family I ever had.

43:00.536 --> 43:04.206
Well, the only family I ever knew, anyway.

43:09.044 --> 43:13.716
I remember my mother and father,
but I can't picture them.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.178
All I remember is a…

43:19.888 --> 43:20.723
a feeling.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.688
You see, I was taken away from them
when I was very young…

43:29.064 --> 43:31.275
and told that someday
I would see them again.

43:33.152 --> 43:34.570
That they would come for me.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.240
But that was a lie.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.327
They never did.

43:45.164 --> 43:47.791
And so all I had was my brother.

43:51.253 --> 43:53.422
And then he was taken away from me too.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.176
And he needed me.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.346
He really needed me…

44:03.015 --> 44:04.350
and I was helpless.

44:06.060 --> 44:09.104
There was nothing I could do
to protect him anymore.

44:26.497 --> 44:30.000
Right now, there's something difficult
I have to tell you.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.089
The doctors and nurses here,

44:35.172 --> 44:36.840
they want to give you hope…

44:37.966 --> 44:41.929
that one day you can leave here
and see your family again.

44:44.431 --> 44:49.520
But you deserve someone
to show you mercy, Mr. Salvatore,

44:50.437 --> 44:52.064
and so I have to tell you

44:52.147 --> 44:56.068
that I know for a fact that
they are never going to let that happen.

44:57.277 --> 44:59.905
You are going to spend
the rest of your life in here…

45:02.700 --> 45:05.703
because your family doesn't ever
want to see you again.

45:07.913 --> 45:10.999
It's something I wish
someone had told me when I was young…

45:13.168 --> 45:15.254
so I could stop believing otherwise.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.468
How different I would be
if someone had.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.350
But I have to tell you,

45:29.059 --> 45:31.437
you have been subjected to enough pain.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.232
You deserve to be free from it.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.712
I am only gonna tell you this once…

45:59.298 --> 46:02.468
but there is a letter opener
on Dr. Hanover's desk.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.389
I can take you there right now.

46:11.643 --> 46:12.853
Would you like that?

46:14.146 --> 46:16.190
<i>-Si.</i>

46:16.273 --> 46:17.691
Fellow Californians.

46:19.318 --> 46:20.152
Hello, Jerry.

46:20.986 --> 46:22.154
Glad you could make it.

47:20.087 --> 47:21.421
Miss Ratched.

47:25.676 --> 47:27.427
Do you take me for an idiot?

47:28.428 --> 47:30.055
Nurse Bucket informed me

47:30.138 --> 47:32.599
that Father Murphy suffered
cardiogenic shock.

47:32.683 --> 47:33.517
That's right.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.229
Strange that the seal is freshly broken,

47:37.312 --> 47:40.482
considering none of our patients
are on this medication.

47:40.566 --> 47:41.984
Of course it would be dangerous

47:42.067 --> 47:44.736
for somebody with Father Murphy's
condition to take these.

47:44.820 --> 47:45.863
Wouldn't you say?

47:45.946 --> 47:46.780
Yes.

47:47.739 --> 47:50.325
I honestly don't know
what you're asking me, Doctor.

47:53.662 --> 47:55.038
Is there somebody in my office?

47:55.122 --> 47:57.082
Dr. Hanover, are you feeling all right?

48:15.517 --> 48:16.935
Oh, God.

48:17.019 --> 48:17.895
I don't…

48:18.562 --> 48:19.646
How'd he get in here?

48:19.730 --> 48:22.274
Clearly, he wasn't being supervised
closely enough.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.193
God damn that Bucket!

48:26.904 --> 48:28.739
-Dr. Hanover.
-What am I going to do?

48:28.822 --> 48:29.865
The press is here.

48:30.574 --> 48:31.825
Dr. Hanover.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.869
You are in a state of shock right now.

48:33.952 --> 48:35.787
What has happened here is a tragedy, yes.

48:35.871 --> 48:38.582
All my work. Everything,
everything I'm fighting for…

48:38.665 --> 48:40.000
I'll be exposed.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.586
-This-- this negligence will ruin me!
-Dr. Hanover.

48:42.669 --> 48:45.422
-Will ruin me!
-Dr. Hanover, you must stop!

48:46.465 --> 48:48.050
I will take care of this.

48:48.133 --> 48:50.677
You stand up tall and proud,
you walk out of this room,

48:50.761 --> 48:53.639
face the governor,
and you be quick about it. He's waiting.

48:54.431 --> 48:55.265
Yes.

48:56.391 --> 48:57.601
Thank you. Thank you.

49:00.687 --> 49:01.813
And Dr. Hanover.

49:03.857 --> 49:06.443
When you have a moment
with the governor after his speech,

49:06.526 --> 49:08.862
you tell him you've offered me
a position here.

49:10.697 --> 49:11.865
He will be pleased.

49:12.616 --> 49:14.368
Yes. Yes, of course.

49:14.826 --> 49:16.036
He'll be pleased.

49:18.956 --> 49:22.250
<i>I am a child of California.</i>

49:22.334 --> 49:26.088
I'm proud to count myself
amongst her native sons.

49:28.256 --> 49:30.759
I was raised on the promise
of this great state.

49:34.471 --> 49:36.598
What exactly are you doing in there?

49:37.683 --> 49:38.558
Hello, Nurse Bucket.

49:39.017 --> 49:42.062
Dr. Hanover asked me to wash the towels
in his private bathroom.

49:42.562 --> 49:46.108
He asked you to wash his towels together
with the linen from the patients' rooms?

49:46.191 --> 49:48.360
Maybe you haven't been listening
to his lectures,

49:48.443 --> 49:51.530
but Dr. Hanover believes
all human beings are equal.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.275
<i>I believe in the dreams of California,</i>

50:28.358 --> 50:31.319
dreams shared by every restless soul

50:31.403 --> 50:36.199
who pulled up stakes and journeyed west
to discover this land.

50:36.825 --> 50:40.787
<i>A place where our tomorrows</i>
<i>are better than our yesterdays,</i>

50:40.871 --> 50:46.501
<i>and where we do not shrink from</i>
<i>the responsibility that is our fellow man!</i>

50:46.585 --> 50:47.711
I promise you…

50:50.672 --> 50:54.468
that we shall win together!

50:55.635 --> 50:56.887
Hanover, it's been a pleasure.

50:56.970 --> 50:58.597
Exceeded expectations.

50:58.680 --> 51:00.432
Thank you, sir.  We'll be in touch.

51:01.141 --> 51:01.975
Yes.

51:02.601 --> 51:03.560
And that nurse…

51:05.645 --> 51:06.688
Ratched.

51:06.772 --> 51:07.898
Tell her I said goodbye.

51:07.981 --> 51:11.902
There's not a lot of meat on her bones,
but what's there is choice.

51:13.570 --> 51:14.404
Let's go!

52:17.342 --> 52:20.554
Edmund Tolleson, you're to be held
at Lucia State Mental Hospital

52:20.637 --> 52:22.139
for a period of 120 days,

52:22.222 --> 52:24.766
or until Dr. Richard Hanover can make
the accurate recommendation

52:24.850 --> 52:26.935
regarding your fitness to stand trial.

52:27.519 --> 52:30.188
During this time, you are still a prisoner
of the state of California,

52:30.272 --> 52:31.481
and will be treated as such.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.445
Edmund Tolleson?

53:24.659 --> 53:25.619
Is that you?

53:27.037 --> 53:28.622
It's me.

53:38.506 --> 53:39.883
I found you.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.260
I finally found you.

53:47.933 --> 53:49.184
I don't wanna die.

53:51.436 --> 53:53.230
You're not going to die, Edmund.

53:54.856 --> 53:56.024
I promise.
