00:15.116 --> 00:17.950
We go up this
beautiful mountain.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.486
This incredible town.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.722
It goes back to
the 12th century.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.557
People trudge up the hill to the

00:24.558 --> 00:25.558
beautiful church to take the

00:25.559 --> 00:31.298
walk that Michael Corleone took.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.732
Now and forever more it will be

00:32.732 --> 00:34.667
"the godfather" theme park where

00:34.668 --> 00:36.136
they are playing "the godfather"

00:36.137 --> 00:40.507
theme over and over I
think most thoughtful to

00:40.508 --> 00:43.176
say you're disgusted by this.

00:43.177 --> 00:43.344
♪

00:43.345 --> 00:46.479
Imagine not waking up every day.

As one bus after another

00:48.649 --> 00:50.350
filled with Japanese tourists go

00:50.351 --> 00:54.154
up there, oh, look, Michael

00:54.155 --> 00:55.123
Corleone got married there.

01:47.209 --> 01:50.009
It's one of the most beautiful

place whose roots are very much

01:51.479 --> 01:54.747
the roots of the town where I

01:54.748 --> 01:55.549
live, but somehow I've never

01:55.550 --> 01:58.918
been able to get it right.

01:58.919 --> 02:02.054
To tell the story,
any story of Sicily.

02:02.055 --> 02:05.024
It's the biggest island
in the Mediterranean Ann.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.895
Two main towns of Palermo and

02:08.895 --> 02:10.530
Catania on opposite sides.

02:10.531 --> 02:13.333
I'm done a show in
Palermo before.

02:13.334 --> 02:17.870
It was an goat rodeo, an
epic of humiliating scale.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.407
This time I was going
to get it right.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.041
There's the Sicily we know from

02:22.042 --> 02:24.344
films, an evocative, deeply felt

02:24.345 --> 02:26.413
history that's not quite reality

02:26.414 --> 02:28.448
but cool anyway, right?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.250
There's the simple fact of its

02:30.251 --> 02:31.518
location, tucked away under the

02:31.519 --> 02:33.220
boot of Italy, part of but not

02:33.221 --> 02:38.191
really part of that country.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.092
Its own language, culture, its

02:40.093 --> 02:45.198
own history of Norman, Arab,
Spanish, Roman, Turkish,

02:45.199 --> 02:49.436
Egyptian interlopers, all
leaving their Mark and their

02:49.437 --> 02:49.703
influence.

02:49.704 --> 02:53.206
I grew up in New Jersey which

02:53.207 --> 02:54.374
was pretty much
Sicily on the Hudson.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.042
The Italian-Americans next door

02:56.043 --> 03:00.280
weren't from Milan, I
could tell you that much.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.215
I guess what I'm telling you is

03:02.216 --> 03:08.221
I figured this will be easy.

03:08.222 --> 03:16.222
Villa Moraci, a certified hotel,

03:17.231 --> 03:19.999
working farm that in this
case produces olive oil.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.402
How many acres of
property do you have?

03:22.403 --> 03:23.304
About 40 acres.

03:23.305 --> 03:27.840
One of the oldest
organic farm mountains.

03:27.841 --> 03:32.845
This is Guido, the proprietor.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.013
Wow.

03:33.014 --> 03:36.182
So that's where
potatoes come from.

03:36.183 --> 03:37.850
How freakin' hard can it be to

03:37.851 --> 03:40.687
make an awesome show in Sicily?

03:40.688 --> 03:44.591
Eat the nice food,
drink the wine.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.627
In an idyllic village in the

03:47.628 --> 03:48.928
countryside, outside Catania.

03:48.929 --> 03:55.167
How low impact can it get?

03:55.168 --> 03:58.170
So the plan was we go fishing.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.974
We get some fresh octopus, maybe

04:01.975 --> 04:03.810
some cuttlefish and explore the

04:03.811 --> 04:05.812
bounties of surrounding waters,

04:05.813 --> 04:06.979
all while working on our tans.

04:06.980 --> 04:12.719
With a local chef,
fishermen, man of the sea.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.886
He's experienced.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.688
He knows where to get it good.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.357
You like the ocean?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.291
I love it.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.526
How do you see it in Italian?

04:19.527 --> 04:21.494
Ricci.

04:21.495 --> 04:25.998
One of my favorite
things to eat.

04:25.999 --> 04:31.203
This is Turin, my host.

04:31.204 --> 04:31.839
Who else is out this octopus?

04:31.840 --> 04:35.808
It's cuttlefish and I want to

04:35.809 --> 04:43.809
try to find some apalone and the

04:44.518 --> 04:45.518
bucce and small clams.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.354
I think they will
be really full.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.522
I'm thinking really?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.724
Are these prime fishing waters?

04:51.725 --> 04:52.925
I don't know about this.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.093
All the boat traffic and all

04:54.094 --> 04:56.195
these people and so close to the

04:56.196 --> 05:00.667
action I can't see much of
anything living down there.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.069
Okay.

05:03.070 --> 05:03.904
We anchor here.

05:03.905 --> 05:07.940
But I am famous for my
optimism so I dutifully suited

05:07.941 --> 05:15.941
up for what was advertised
as a three-hour cruise.

05:18.952 --> 05:23.923
So I get in the water,
and I'm paddling around.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.191
And splash.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.360
Suddenly there's a dead sea

05:27.361 --> 05:31.698
creature sinking slowly so
the seabed in front of me.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.965
Are they kidding me?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.034
I'm thinking can
this be happening?

05:35.035 --> 05:39.439
Splash, another rigor mortis

05:39.440 --> 05:42.542
half-frozen freakin'
octopus but it goes on.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.211
One dead cuttlefish, octopus,

05:45.212 --> 05:47.046
frozen sea urchin after another,

05:47.047 --> 05:48.715
splash, splash, splash.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.550
Each specimen drops among the

05:50.551 --> 05:53.986
rocks or along the sea floor, to

05:53.987 --> 05:56.656
be heroically discovered and

05:56.657 --> 05:57.890
proudly shown off to camera,

05:57.891 --> 05:59.992
like I'm not actually washing as

05:59.993 --> 06:02.729
the confederate in the next boat

06:02.730 --> 06:09.769
over hurls them into the
water one after another.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.938
I'm no marine biologist, but I

06:11.939 --> 06:14.507
know dead octopus
when I sea one.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.642
Pretty sure they don't drop from

06:15.643 --> 06:17.644
the sky and sink
straight to the bottom.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.679
How many do we have?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.147
Three?

06:20.148 --> 06:21.180
Yeah.

06:21.181 --> 06:21.582
Okay.

06:21.583 --> 06:29.583
I tried to get some patate
now and also small abalone.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.359
Strangely everyone believes
the hideous sham unfolding

06:33.360 --> 06:35.327
before our eyes, Doug our best

06:35.328 --> 06:39.832
to ignore the
blindingly obvious.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.668
Don't swim at it.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.135
Then they gave up and dumped

06:43.136 --> 06:51.136
the whole bag of dead
fish into the sea.

06:52.345 --> 06:56.883
At this point I begin desperately
looking for signs of

06:56.884 --> 06:58.551
life, hoping that one of them

06:58.552 --> 07:01.821
would stir, become revived.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.022
I'm frantically swimming around

07:03.023 --> 07:04.624
the bottom littered with dead

07:04.625 --> 07:05.858
things looking for one that's

07:05.859 --> 07:07.293
still twitching so can I hold it

07:07.294 --> 07:09.195
up to the camera and end this

07:09.196 --> 07:15.635
misery, but, no, my
shame will be absolute.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.369
For some reason I feel something

07:17.370 --> 07:20.206
snap, and I slide quickly into a

07:20.207 --> 07:23.676
spiral of near
hysterical depression.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.712
Is this what it's come to, I'm

07:25.713 --> 07:27.680
thinking, as another dead squid

07:27.681 --> 07:28.848
narrowly misses my head?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.483
Almost a decade later back in

07:30.484 --> 07:32.685
the same country, and I'm still

07:32.686 --> 07:35.722
desperately staging fishing

07:35.723 --> 07:37.824
scenes, creeding the oceans with

07:37.825 --> 07:38.891
supermarket seafood, complicit

07:38.892 --> 07:43.162
in a shameful, shameful
incident of fakery.

07:43.163 --> 07:48.501
But there I was, bobbing
liftlessly in the water.

07:48.502 --> 07:52.171
Dead sea life sinking to
the bottom all around me.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.573
You've got to be pretty immune

07:53.574 --> 08:01.574
to the world to not see some
kind of obvious metaphor.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.758
I've never had anerrious

08:11.759 --> 08:13.025
breakdown before, but I tell you

08:13.026 --> 08:14.761
from the bottom of my heart

08:14.762 --> 08:15.862
something took part down there,

08:15.863 --> 08:17.463
and it took a long, long time

08:17.464 --> 08:25.464
after the end of this
damn episode to recover.

08:36.750 --> 08:44.750
♪

08:56.469 --> 08:58.504
No need to boil.

08:58.505 --> 09:02.275
We'll be ready without it.

09:21.695 --> 09:29.669
Raw clams, abalone and a
heart-warming beet scene

09:29.670 --> 09:32.204
surrounded with a
gaggle of curious kids.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.875
It was at this point time
for Ture to redeem himself.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.109
You'll notice, I'm not there.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.511
I'm sitting in a nearby cafe

09:39.512 --> 09:42.649
pounding one negrone after in a

09:42.650 --> 09:46.285
smouldering miserable rage.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.688
Our evening meal will be at

09:48.689 --> 09:51.023
Ture's place which is just up

09:51.024 --> 09:55.027
the hill in Turmina, but by the

09:55.028 --> 09:59.131
time dinner is near, I'm ripped

09:59.132 --> 10:02.334
to the... did I mention
it's my birthday?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.502
Are couple hours on a boat, a

10:03.503 --> 10:05.071
couple more hours getting looped

10:05.072 --> 10:07.039
and a couple more hours on the

10:07.040 --> 10:08.741
restaurant so I'm
gone, baby, gone.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.542
So I don't remember any of this.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.545
Any of it.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.214
So how is your day today?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.482
Good.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.684
A nice boat trip.

10:17.685 --> 10:18.485
A little swim.

10:18.486 --> 10:20.920
I would be told later that a

10:20.921 --> 10:24.924
gentleman named Tomaso joined me

10:24.925 --> 10:26.225
for dinner and also someone on

10:26.226 --> 10:28.027
the crusade his wife was present

10:28.028 --> 10:29.595
and she didn't say much.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.363
Preferably because this wasn't

10:31.364 --> 10:33.499
her preferred way to
spend her birthday.

10:33.500 --> 10:33.734
Hi.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.234
Tony.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.202
This is my passion.

10:35.203 --> 10:38.738
I like to find the old variety

10:38.739 --> 10:40.840
of olive, and one
of this is white.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.074
So that's original.

10:42.075 --> 10:42.409
Original.

10:42.410 --> 10:44.010
You don't find it anyplace else.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.712
Apparently there were these

10:45.713 --> 10:48.447
white olives harvested from some

10:48.448 --> 10:50.216
secret tree only
Ture knows about.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.019
Maybe it's next to his
secret fishing hole.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.954
There was great Sicilian wine

10:54.955 --> 10:58.224
apparently, and apparently
I drank quite a lot of it.

10:58.225 --> 11:01.127
There was bread and olive oil,

11:01.128 --> 11:04.797
abalone served raw in the shell,

11:04.798 --> 11:06.933
baby sardine, also served raw

11:06.934 --> 11:11.237
with a splash of
citrus and salt.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.974
And this is the baby sardine,

11:14.975 --> 11:16.575
totally raw without no match

11:16.576 --> 11:20.212
ingredients to taste
better the fish.

11:20.213 --> 11:20.447
Salud.

11:20.448 --> 11:21.981
Thank you.

11:21.982 --> 11:26.719
If you ask a Sicilian, right,
say where you come from?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.956
The correct answer
should be I'm Italian.

11:29.957 --> 11:30.390
Right.

11:30.391 --> 11:32.725
We say I'm Sicilian.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.160
Is Sicily, Italy?

11:34.161 --> 11:34.661
Yes.

11:34.662 --> 11:35.762
Should it be?

11:35.763 --> 11:39.665
I don't know, but we used to

11:39.666 --> 11:41.968
have influence from Britains,

11:41.969 --> 11:46.238
Normans, Arab, Spanish, so
basically we are a mix.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.975
We're a blender.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.642
Oh, look, my octopus.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.745
I remember personally
catching that one.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.481
It was a mighty struggle, too.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.484
No, actually I don't.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.319
Octopus.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.621
Pretty, beautiful little shrimp.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.957
Very tender, the
octopus, very nice.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.293
And another traditional
specialty.

12:07.294 --> 12:12.031
I'm told they call
this tuna tartar.

12:12.032 --> 12:17.503
And cuttlefish, recognize
you, my friend.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.572
How traditional is
this to Sicily?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.209
I think from the part of the

12:23.210 --> 12:24.276
sea they almost eat a roll.

12:24.277 --> 12:24.677
Yes.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.213
But fish every one men only,

12:27.214 --> 12:29.648
fishing communities
only or in restaurants.

12:29.649 --> 12:30.317
If no.

12:30.318 --> 12:33.185
Always as long as you could

12:33.186 --> 12:36.455
arude, you see crudo like this?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.224
I see it in poor families.

12:38.225 --> 12:41.961
The Japanese sort of gave
everybody permission to eat

12:41.962 --> 12:44.163
traditional foods, their
own traditional foods.

12:44.164 --> 12:48.467
What are the great mother
Sicilian classic dishes?

12:48.468 --> 12:52.138
The anchovy.

12:52.139 --> 12:57.343
Anchovy and parmegiana.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.544
That's with the sardine.

12:58.545 --> 13:05.918
But it's an explosion of
flower, because it's Arab.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.921
Born in the period when
Sicily was very poor.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.022
This I like.

13:10.023 --> 13:17.329
I even remember it.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.431
Pasta, a true Sicilian classic

13:19.432 --> 13:22.869
made with fennel, pine
nuts, saffron and anchovy.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.337
Served alongside some par dines

13:25.338 --> 13:27.673
that have been curing in
chestnuts and salt for days,

13:27.674 --> 13:29.075
then lightly fried in oil.

13:29.076 --> 13:34.013
We have to use our hand, use
our hand to eat the fish.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.348
No problem.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.284
I must have shrunk back to bed

13:38.285 --> 13:42.088
somehow, collapsed in a sodden

13:42.089 --> 13:44.190
drunken heap of self-loathing.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.125
I normally would have turned on

13:46.126 --> 13:48.794
the porn challenge and turned on

13:48.795 --> 13:54.034
the TV but there is no
TV at the agri tourismo.

14:02.309 --> 14:06.145
>I love the films "godfather

14:06.146 --> 14:08.380
1" and "godfather 2" but they

14:08.381 --> 14:10.917
had nothing to do with any
organized crime from opera.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.718
They are opera, magnificent on

14:12.719 --> 14:16.155
race, but basically a morality
tale about toilety and

14:16.156 --> 14:16.924
destroying the things that you

14:16.925 --> 14:23.395
claim to love and
want to protect.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.797
Actual organized crime members

14:25.798 --> 14:27.599
and literally speaking a bunch

14:27.600 --> 14:30.169
of lazy ass sociopaths who have

14:30.170 --> 14:31.603
no problem stealing from their

14:31.604 --> 14:33.139
own harder working neighbors.

14:33.140 --> 14:37.609
Here in Sicily they are
interested and less glamorous

14:37.610 --> 14:39.278
than gambling and prostitution.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.479
They have and traditionally have

14:40.480 --> 14:43.649
been a gigantic parasitical

14:43.650 --> 14:44.850
organization, one that has now

14:44.851 --> 14:50.489
grown to be of mere
equal size as its host.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.590
Mary is originally from new

14:51.591 --> 14:53.092
York, but she's been living here

14:53.093 --> 14:55.427
in Palermo for half
a century now.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.629
She's a food writer and at one

14:57.630 --> 14:59.999
time a reformer for social

15:00.000 --> 15:05.204
justice which is a dicey
thing to be here.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.607
You've been here all this time?

15:08.608 --> 15:08.775
Why?

15:08.776 --> 15:10.776
Well, I came for a year.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.479
It was going to be a year
between college and graduate

15:13.480 --> 15:13.713
school.

15:13.714 --> 15:16.682
I just finished college.

15:16.683 --> 15:23.956
I met a man, and
therein lies the why.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.859
I mayor aid Sicilian and
have been here ever since.

15:27.860 --> 15:30.129
Piccolo Napoli, a restaurant

15:30.130 --> 15:32.164
that's been here for a lot of

15:32.165 --> 15:34.366
years and is known for
the quality of its food.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.535
Tell me about where
we are, first of all.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.237
The father and mother of the

15:38.238 --> 15:40.239
present owner opened this in

15:40.240 --> 15:41.907
1951 when there was a wonderful

15:41.908 --> 15:45.911
photograph there on the
wall of the opening day.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.247
It started as a tavern and has

15:48.248 --> 15:50.216
become a well-known and much

15:50.217 --> 15:51.517
appreciated restaurant now.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.884
It's very straightforward

15:52.885 --> 15:58.024
Sicilian cooking at its best.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.725
We start with some typical

15:59.726 --> 16:01.527
things, the kind of things I

16:01.528 --> 16:02.928
deeply love, the kind of simple

16:02.929 --> 16:06.865
good things that make me happy.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.167
Panelli which is a fritter made

16:08.168 --> 16:10.669
from chickpeas, cap nata, a

16:10.670 --> 16:12.571
sweet and sour eggplant dish,

16:12.572 --> 16:15.707
kind of like rat actually and a

16:15.708 --> 16:17.609
plate of olives and white wine

16:17.610 --> 16:18.677
produced from a small batch

16:18.678 --> 16:21.413
vineyard run by Mary
and her husband.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.116
This is a panelli?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.517
Chickpea flour that comes in

16:25.518 --> 16:27.419
with the Arabs, maybe even

16:27.420 --> 16:28.454
earlier, because chickpeas have

16:28.455 --> 16:30.689
been around for a long time.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.791
And this is the fame out cap

16:32.792 --> 16:38.297
nata and about Assisi
asilian as it gets.

16:38.298 --> 16:42.968
Capanat and cannoli are the

16:42.969 --> 16:47.039
two well known Sicilian dishes.

16:47.040 --> 16:49.475
This is what I've
been waiting for.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.477
This is what I wanted Sicily to

16:51.478 --> 16:54.746
be, something to soothe
my shattered soul.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.616
It doesn't take much,
a bowl of good pasta.

16:57.617 --> 17:05.617
In this case the famous
spaghetti Al Nero Di sepia,

17:07.127 --> 17:09.395
spaghetti and cuttlefish and

17:09.396 --> 17:14.933
pasta with swordfish,
eggplant and tomatoes.

17:14.934 --> 17:20.271
Oh, beautiful.

17:20.272 --> 17:20.807
Perfect.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.641
Perfect pasta.

17:21.642 --> 17:23.809
Very happy with that.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.344
Good.

17:24.345 --> 17:25.644
I know you've been looking

17:25.645 --> 17:31.983
forward to it so I'm
glad it's good.

17:31.984 --> 17:34.486
It's an expensive city for some

17:34.487 --> 17:37.623
things because the
consumer is paying.

17:37.624 --> 17:37.890
More.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.660
More so that the store can
afford to pay its extortion

17:41.661 --> 17:42.028
money.

17:42.029 --> 17:43.862
The big change that has happened

17:43.863 --> 17:46.698
is that up until the mid-'80s,

17:46.699 --> 17:48.467
the late '80s, there were a

17:48.468 --> 17:50.102
great many Sicilians who thought

17:50.103 --> 17:51.537
if they were honest and didn't

17:51.538 --> 17:53.505
have anything to do with the

17:53.506 --> 17:54.307
mafia, they could live without

17:54.308 --> 17:58.043
being affected by the mafia.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.179
Apparently 80% of the businesses

18:00.180 --> 18:03.615
in Palermo and 70% in the rest

18:03.616 --> 18:06.185
of Italy that pay extortion.

18:06.186 --> 18:06.653
That's a lot.

18:06.654 --> 18:07.853
That's a lot.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.156
But not everybody pays the bite.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.990
A small but growing coalition of

18:11.991 --> 18:16.995
businesses have joined a group,

18:16.996 --> 18:19.798
a grass roots organization
taking a stand against the

18:19.799 --> 18:21.667
mafia's traditional mere total

18:21.668 --> 18:24.336
control over the food
chain, from farm to table.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.738
I come out of the restaurant
business in New York.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.475
You got taxed with every laundry

18:29.476 --> 18:31.977
order every time they
took your trash away.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.147
It was built in to all
your basic services.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.749
Here it's much
more going around.

18:37.750 --> 18:38.651
Christmas and Easter.

18:38.652 --> 18:39.652
Guy comes by.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.487
The guy comes by.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.388
It's plain and simple extortion.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.356
Given that that's a pretty

18:44.357 --> 18:45.657
straightforward situation, some

18:45.658 --> 18:48.494
of these guys who banded

18:48.495 --> 18:49.895
together, what happens, the guy

18:49.896 --> 18:52.030
shows up and says
I'm not paying you.

18:52.031 --> 18:52.999
What happens next?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.602
Well, apparently now the

18:56.603 --> 18:59.505
mafia has decided that it isn't

18:59.506 --> 19:00.273
worthwhile bothering with the

19:00.274 --> 19:03.041
people who belong to the group.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.276
There's so many others out there

19:04.277 --> 19:06.212
and why look for trouble.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.279
How true it is, I don't know.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.047
Right.

19:08.048 --> 19:09.581
To belong to the group, you

19:09.582 --> 19:11.717
have to sign a pledge that you

19:11.718 --> 19:14.953
will not pay and that if you are

19:14.954 --> 19:17.523
approached, will you
go to the police.

19:17.524 --> 19:17.790
Right.

19:17.791 --> 19:18.857
Then they send you to lawyers

19:18.858 --> 19:20.692
and to another organization

19:20.693 --> 19:21.793
which deals with the people who

19:21.794 --> 19:24.630
are actually having trouble.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.097
It's incredibly complicated.

19:26.098 --> 19:30.769
I mean, there are
no easy answers.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.604
Right.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.240
What about big farm?

19:34.241 --> 19:35.774
What about some of the things

19:35.775 --> 19:37.943
that are... that are happening

19:37.944 --> 19:40.145
on a much more legitimate level?

19:40.146 --> 19:42.948
I mean, who is more
destructive worldwide?

19:42.949 --> 19:45.617
You can make a very
good argument.

19:45.618 --> 19:46.785
That's horrible.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.720
I'm upset because I sound as if

19:48.721 --> 19:51.156
I'm making apologies
for the mafia.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.558
It's just I think what has

19:52.559 --> 19:54.059
happened, that having lived 50

19:54.060 --> 19:56.328
years in Sicily, I'm much more

19:56.329 --> 19:57.429
skeptical than most Americans.

19:57.430 --> 19:57.964
Right.

19:57.965 --> 20:00.299
I don't know.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.633
I know what you're saying.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.102
You're saying you're not so sure

20:04.103 --> 20:06.672
that a mafia-free Italy would be

20:06.673 --> 20:08.574
that much more functional?

20:08.575 --> 20:09.575
Absolutely.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.142
I'm not so sure.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.444
I'm not so sure at all.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.680
But I am constantly amused by

20:14.681 --> 20:17.583
the fact that 45 years ago, if I

20:17.584 --> 20:20.151
said to Americans, oh, I live in

20:20.152 --> 20:22.187
sissy, Sicily, how did a nice

20:22.188 --> 20:24.623
girl like you end up
in a place like that?

20:24.624 --> 20:25.991
Really.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.328
Now it's oh, on a farm
in Sicily, how romantic.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.263
Oh, I envy you.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.666
So perception of Sicily
it has changed.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.802
It has changed.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.472
In 2007 there were only 160

20:40.473 --> 20:42.974
group members, and now over 800.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.009
Pretty cool considering we're

20:44.010 --> 20:45.877
talking about a group who have

20:45.878 --> 20:48.146
demonstrated no regret or

20:48.147 --> 20:54.886
hesitation in killing judges,
politicians, police,

20:54.887 --> 20:58.156
prosecutors.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.992
Back to Catania, and when you're

21:00.993 --> 21:05.030
talking late-night dining
options, you're talking one

21:05.031 --> 21:08.367
thing, the enticing smell of
smoke wafting through the

21:08.368 --> 21:11.837
streets, a smell that's
enticingly equine.

21:11.838 --> 21:15.641
I smell rainbow dash.

21:15.642 --> 21:20.145
Yes, yes.

21:20.146 --> 21:20.347
Yes.

21:20.348 --> 21:24.350
Anthony and Marco, a couple

21:24.351 --> 21:31.857
of Sicilians and aficionados.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.360
This is one of the older

21:34.361 --> 21:38.263
side, famous, you know, families

21:38.264 --> 21:41.433
of mafia that grows in
crime organization here.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.234
Oh, right here?

21:42.235 --> 21:43.835
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.606
Nowadays seems to be like a

21:47.607 --> 21:49.341
bit more quiet because they are

21:49.342 --> 21:51.343
all getting arrested so they

21:51.344 --> 21:59.017
prefer to sell meat
against drugs.

21:59.018 --> 22:02.020
So right over there you
can bet on a horse.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.455
We can bet horses, yes.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.958
Bet horses, and here you
eat the one that lose.

22:06.959 --> 22:07.394
Right.

22:07.395 --> 22:10.962
The loser goes on the fire.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.131
That's not a nice thing, but, I

22:13.132 --> 22:15.634
mean, sometimes it
happens for real.

22:15.635 --> 22:18.770
Cycle of life.

22:18.771 --> 22:22.441
All right.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.442
So why horse?

22:23.443 --> 22:27.979
Where does this
tradition come from?

22:27.980 --> 22:29.715
Maybe also Egyptians and then

22:29.716 --> 22:32.183
we have Greeks, 750
years before Christ.

22:32.184 --> 22:35.053
Then we have Romans.

22:35.054 --> 22:35.655
Because?

22:35.656 --> 22:42.093
We have to say is I
asilians are big bastards.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.563
Of course, we're being
conquered by everybody.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.731
Also our dialect.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.132
There are many words that are

22:47.133 --> 22:48.434
understood by other people.

22:48.435 --> 22:52.270
If I say is I asilian dialect
word, maybe an Arab can

22:52.271 --> 22:55.006
understand me, and the Italian

22:55.007 --> 22:56.742
language comes from Latin,
something different.

22:56.743 --> 23:02.414
We are Sicilians before
Italians, remember this.

23:02.415 --> 23:10.415
I'll never forget.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.960
Look at this side of the meat.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.295
It's yellow, it's not white.

23:17.296 --> 23:21.299
When it's yellow, it means that

23:21.300 --> 23:29.300
the horse has been
eating fresh grass.

23:43.055 --> 23:43.856
Prepare and go.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.023
You like the faith?

23:45.024 --> 23:45.692
It's good.

23:45.693 --> 23:47.025
It's a bit sweet.

23:47.026 --> 23:50.228
You don't need nothing.

23:50.229 --> 23:51.130
Horse meat.

23:51.131 --> 23:55.967
Loved by quite everybody
here, you know.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.904
Dewith have it for meat balls,

23:58.905 --> 24:00.839
and we can have a
horse meat ball.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.474
As you wish.

24:02.475 --> 24:04.309
I'll try anything.

24:04.310 --> 24:08.313
Make some different
things, you know.

24:08.314 --> 24:11.850
Bread, Parmesan
cheese, pecorino.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.151
Right.

24:12.152 --> 24:17.155
Parsley, eggs, and,
of course, horse.

24:17.156 --> 24:17.657
Horse.

24:17.658 --> 24:19.491
It is very tasty.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.527
Let's put it this way.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.895
When my daughter asks me for a

24:23.896 --> 24:27.032
pony, I'm bringing her here and

24:27.033 --> 24:30.803
asking for a grill and
saying here is your pony.

24:43.516 --> 24:47.085
>This national park and
within a free range pig farm.

24:47.086 --> 24:52.057
They breed special heritage
pigs here, the black boar.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.561
A combination of wild Sicilian

24:55.562 --> 24:56.195
boar and domesticated swine

24:56.195 --> 24:57.129
thought to be brought here from

24:57.130 --> 24:58.730
Spain long ago, this breed of

24:58.731 --> 25:04.736
pig is raising the
profile of the pig here.

25:04.737 --> 25:08.306
It's every we are.

25:08.307 --> 25:12.611
Look, look, here now, the noise.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.547
They will arrive.

25:15.548 --> 25:15.848
Fantastica.

25:15.849 --> 25:19.918
Like any good-tasting
high-quality pig, the secret is

25:19.919 --> 25:21.887
largely what were they fed?

25:21.888 --> 25:22.888
How did they live?

25:22.889 --> 25:27.325
Were they happy?

25:27.326 --> 25:29.127
I'm a hunter.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.796
I've never seen so many in once.

25:30.797 --> 25:36.401
It's like I feel... you
should be shooting something.

25:36.402 --> 25:36.669
Yeah.

25:36.670 --> 25:40.238
A poorly fed pig who lived

25:40.239 --> 25:41.573
his life in squalor, stress and

25:41.574 --> 25:43.008
fear makes for bad pork.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.076
This is why we should treat

25:45.077 --> 25:46.845
animals well, not just because

25:46.846 --> 25:48.413
that's the nice thing to do, but

25:48.414 --> 25:56.414
because it makes them
provably more delicious.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.995
Chestnuts, acorns, roots and

26:03.996 --> 26:06.264
stuff foraged from the hills,

26:06.265 --> 26:08.499
supplemented by some nice
fattening grain during the

26:08.500 --> 26:10.201
winter months when wild food is

26:10.202 --> 26:12.638
less easy and less plentiful.

26:12.639 --> 26:17.042
They catch here the animal.

26:17.043 --> 26:17.443
Right.

26:17.444 --> 26:22.047
It's a shame that they
don't let you shoot.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.882
I like pigs.

26:23.883 --> 26:25.651
Not to hang out with, to eat.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.485
I don't have a tattoo of a pig

26:27.486 --> 26:30.055
or anything, but I like them
fine, and when given the

26:30.056 --> 26:31.556
opportunity to shoot one in the

26:31.557 --> 26:33.058
brain or see one shot in the

26:33.059 --> 26:38.229
brain so that I may suck on its

26:38.230 --> 26:40.732
entrails and other
parts, I'm down.

26:40.733 --> 26:44.670
That's what is called cheering
me up from some manic

26:44.671 --> 26:44.971
depression.

26:44.972 --> 26:52.410
Bang, and this pig is like
Pauly, you won't see him no

26:52.411 --> 26:54.646
more.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.381
Even with the brain dead, the

26:56.382 --> 26:59.250
heart still goes on beating,

26:59.251 --> 27:01.386
sort of like pick a Kardashian.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.054
In the case, however, the last

27:03.055 --> 27:05.156
few beats of the heart are

27:05.157 --> 27:06.157
absolutely necessary to pump all

27:06.158 --> 27:14.158
that red, red carve in a
bucket for sanguinacco.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.711
Looking good.

27:25.712 --> 27:29.580
There's a Kardashian
joke there somewhere.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.549
Kim gets ready for the big day.

27:31.550 --> 27:36.621
It's date night
at Khloe's house.

27:36.622 --> 27:41.226
Veal housewife gets
ready for summer.

27:41.227 --> 27:47.632
Grooming tips from
Theresa Guidice.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.568
Let's hope Kanye never
has to see this.

27:50.569 --> 27:56.041
We hang now.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.042
Bye.

27:57.043 --> 28:01.146
Then get to work.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.816
Okay.

28:04.817 --> 28:07.552
Very fast.

28:07.553 --> 28:09.087
All those good bits, the

28:09.088 --> 28:13.624
lungs, kidneys, they get cooked

28:13.625 --> 28:15.727
slowly in fat with garlic, chili

28:15.728 --> 28:17.495
pepper, a little wine.

28:17.496 --> 28:21.933
Is the meat also the liver?

28:21.934 --> 28:29.934
All the interior with
a little bit of fat?

28:31.577 --> 28:33.111
With a little bit of the fat.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.847
It's a pork confit.

28:35.848 --> 28:36.948
Oh, that's pretty.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.817
Meanwhile the intestinal casings

28:38.818 --> 28:40.585
get filled with blood and gently

28:40.586 --> 28:45.791
poached until creamy
bloody delicious.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.193
And a nice spread of homemade

28:48.194 --> 28:52.964
cured meats, local cheese
and homemade wine.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.866
Let the party begin.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.335
So, what do we have here?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.038
Let's identify these products.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.873
Cap koala.

29:01.874 --> 29:09.514
Capicola, prosciutto.

29:09.515 --> 29:09.882
Pancetta.

29:09.883 --> 29:13.384
Oh, that looks good.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.521
The cheese is local, provolone.

29:16.522 --> 29:20.959
This is the ricotta and
just cooked in the oven.

29:20.960 --> 29:21.360
The bread.

29:21.361 --> 29:25.563
The bread is from the ankle,

29:25.564 --> 29:27.999
and they have also salami
and they have sausages.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.037
And this cheese?

29:32.038 --> 29:40.038
Cannistratsglo and what
do you call that dish?

29:44.383 --> 29:45.984
Just in the pan.

29:45.985 --> 29:53.985
Beautiful.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.165
Oh, it's good.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.067
Best moment of the day.

30:01.067 --> 30:01.868
Indeed.

30:01.869 --> 30:04.335
Oh, yeah.

30:04.336 --> 30:05.770
What did you think about?

30:05.771 --> 30:08.739
It's good.

30:08.740 --> 30:15.413
For me the ricotta,
it's really good.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.016
Here in Sicily, I expect that

30:18.017 --> 30:19.717
very few people know this is

30:19.718 --> 30:21.252
incredible, even the bread is

30:21.253 --> 30:23.521
the old lady that she made.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.023
Oh.

30:24.456 --> 30:26.257
You think of Sicily, you think

30:26.258 --> 30:27.558
of family, you think of food.

30:27.559 --> 30:34.733
This is more like it.

31:00.092 --> 31:05.330
We'll stop here for shrimp.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.565
Catania, the early
morning market.

31:07.566 --> 31:11.302
It's been going on for longer

31:11.303 --> 31:12.303
than America has as a country.

31:12.304 --> 31:16.942
It's old, old Italia.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.843
Do they know you here?

31:18.844 --> 31:22.113
Do you shop here often?

31:22.114 --> 31:22.414
Yeah.

31:22.415 --> 31:24.950
This is not Tomaso's first

31:24.951 --> 31:26.751
trip to the market
by a long shot.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.119
His mom is a regular.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.620
She comes here almost every day.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.989
Thanks.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.491
And this is the next stock
market you can find here

31:33.492 --> 31:33.792
everything.

31:33.793 --> 31:36.127
Each butcher, more likely they

31:36.128 --> 31:38.096
have their own specialty.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.865
Fresh ingredients, you know.

31:40.866 --> 31:41.933
They do lamb.

31:41.934 --> 31:49.708
Lamb, sauceage is and Hamburg

31:49.976 --> 31:50.142
er.

31:50.143 --> 31:52.377
This is at least six
months old, at least.

31:52.378 --> 31:52.844
Over here.

31:52.845 --> 31:55.380
This is the place where she buy

31:55.381 --> 32:03.381
the spices for her
home, and the veggies.

32:03.956 --> 32:08.026
This is what the market is
best known for, seafood.

32:08.027 --> 32:12.230
Bongiourno.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.699
This one is one of the biggest

32:14.700 --> 32:16.701
sellers that we have
in the fish market.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.405
Can you see also the variety.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.340
Yeah.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.143
We consider the tuna like a pig.

32:25.144 --> 32:29.380
We don't throw away anything.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.082
See, this is typical.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.217
You can find it here.

32:32.218 --> 32:36.021
Oh, those are the tiny,
tiny little clams.

32:36.022 --> 32:38.556
Right.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.825
Yes.

32:40.826 --> 32:48.826
You can see the shrimp
are still alive.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.601
So I see sepia.

32:50.602 --> 32:56.274
Yeah, baby sardines.

32:56.275 --> 32:56.575
Swordfish.

32:56.576 --> 32:59.177
I'm joining Tomaso
for lunch Tate.

32:59.178 --> 33:04.382
Mom's cooking, so we've
got to do some shopping.

33:04.383 --> 33:08.553
Bongiourno.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.954
They look beautiful.

33:09.955 --> 33:10.256
Yeah.

33:10.257 --> 33:16.627
The color is beautiful.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.964
And bongiourno.

33:19.965 --> 33:25.936
So we'll go have some
today, so shrimp.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.972
And baby sardines.

33:27.973 --> 33:28.907
Gracias.

33:28.908 --> 33:33.711
Bongiourno.

33:33.712 --> 33:34.480
I'll tell you.

33:34.481 --> 33:37.582
What do you want to try?

33:37.583 --> 33:43.821
Blood sausage?

33:43.822 --> 33:47.958
Just blood, no onion,
no spice, nothing?

33:47.959 --> 33:48.827
A little salt.

33:48.828 --> 33:50.061
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.130
Oh, a little pepper.

33:52.131 --> 33:52.798
Si.

33:52.799 --> 33:53.898
You squeeze it.

33:53.899 --> 34:01.899
No, no, no.

34:11.783 --> 34:15.186
Oh, man.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.121
Interesting runner up.

34:17.123 --> 34:17.789
Oh, that's good.

34:17.790 --> 34:23.128
Usually I don't like it
plain, like it in a sauce and

34:23.129 --> 34:23.329
spicy.

34:23.330 --> 34:26.630
That's very tasty.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.166
Looks like hell.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.300
Tastes like heaven.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.137
If you like this,
you're Sicilian.

34:32.138 --> 34:38.610
Very, very.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.899
>I don't have any grandparents.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.234
My mom, I guess she cooks, but

35:03.235 --> 35:04.635
last time she ever invited me

35:04.636 --> 35:07.205
for dinner was like 1972 so

35:07.206 --> 35:09.474
given that dysfunctional, tragic

35:09.475 --> 35:12.810
too much kind of history is it

35:12.811 --> 35:15.846
any mystery why I'm on
the lookout for grandma?

35:15.847 --> 35:17.582
Anybody's grandmother's
would do.

35:17.583 --> 35:21.819
I've been known to hitch-hike
highways looking for any

35:21.820 --> 35:23.688
grannies and given my fragile

35:23.689 --> 35:26.090
emotional sense it makes sense

35:26.091 --> 35:30.728
that I would dragoon Tomaso's

35:30.729 --> 35:33.898
mom into making me a lunch.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.534
Is that intriguing or sad?

35:36.535 --> 35:39.937
Smells good in here.

35:39.938 --> 35:40.206
Cheers.

35:40.207 --> 35:41.207
Cheers.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.341
Need any help chopping parsley?

35:43.342 --> 35:45.876
Oh, perfect.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.212
For lunch we've got the shrimp

35:47.213 --> 35:49.780
and sardines from earlier at the

35:49.781 --> 35:51.949
market, but first this.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.351
Just grab one?

35:53.352 --> 36:01.352
It's like arancini but with
hole owed out potatoes.

36:01.627 --> 36:07.598
Basically, and with
all the cheese.

36:07.599 --> 36:12.570
And deep in and sealed the
potatoes and then fried.

36:12.571 --> 36:19.644
My mother cooks for
everybody, even if it was

36:19.645 --> 36:21.612
so when we have to share all

36:21.613 --> 36:22.780
together and have a dinner, my

36:22.781 --> 36:25.783
mother is cooking for everybody.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.718
Because the problem is when she

36:27.719 --> 36:30.120
cook, even if she know it's only

36:30.121 --> 36:32.156
for five people, she
cooking for ten.

36:32.157 --> 36:40.157
Just in case.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.069
This is Sicily, after all.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.504
This is the classic starter.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.573
Also a bread and tomato salad.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.875
Would you like to try something?

36:50.876 --> 36:57.982
That's old school.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.984
We use bread that a harder.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.320
We usually do bread
that is two days old.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.454
It's really good.

37:03.455 --> 37:08.359
Really, really good.

37:08.360 --> 37:08.927
That's Sicily right there.

37:08.927 --> 37:09.194
Right.

37:09.195 --> 37:15.533
Yes.

37:15.534 --> 37:18.536
Fresh shrimp sautes
in butter and garlic.

37:18.537 --> 37:23.007
When they are confronted
with the shrimp, fry away.

37:23.008 --> 37:29.046
That's the way you see
if it's fresh or not.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.981
So typical day, when you were

37:30.982 --> 37:37.488
15 years old what did
you eat for lunch?

37:37.489 --> 37:40.391
Fish and pasta.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.492
Basically you have to go right

37:41.493 --> 37:44.795
behind the corner to
find your products.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.964
Whatever we could produce in

37:46.965 --> 37:49.400
Zitly, that's what
we choose to buy.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.235
Watch this.

37:50.236 --> 37:51.536
Zip the bone right out.

37:51.537 --> 37:52.203
Out comes all the bone.

37:52.204 --> 37:55.506
Who needs a knife?

37:55.507 --> 38:03.507
Sardines fileted neatly,
sauteed in garlic and oil.

38:07.819 --> 38:12.857
I'll tell you, another two hours

38:12.858 --> 38:14.825
here I'll be speaking Sicilian.

38:14.826 --> 38:15.327
You have to eat it hot.

38:15.328 --> 38:17.428
This is very nice.

38:17.429 --> 38:25.429
If you don't like this,
there's no hope for you.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.409
If you like it.

38:30.409 --> 38:30.909
Tell her.

38:30.910 --> 38:33.511
Happy.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.380
This is a delicious meal.

38:34.381 --> 38:36.747
And to eat in this beautiful

38:36.748 --> 38:40.919
home with some really
good home cooked food.

38:53.031 --> 38:58.135
>My last night in Sicily.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.770
After this I'm calling in bed

38:59.771 --> 39:02.407
and taking the fetal
position for six weeks.

39:02.408 --> 39:05.142
I may look normal...
Okay, I don't exactly.

39:05.143 --> 39:08.979
But I'm not barking or shrieking

39:08.980 --> 39:12.817
with my pants wrapped around my

39:12.818 --> 39:14.151
head which is what my instincts

39:14.152 --> 39:15.953
are telling me I
should be doing.

39:15.954 --> 39:19.156
One of life's great
joys is cheese.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.825
No, I'm eating cheese.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.993
Which makes me happy.

39:22.994 --> 39:23.294
Always.

39:23.295 --> 39:25.295
And drink wine.

39:25.296 --> 39:26.664
Good wine.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.833
And a hell of a lot of it.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.669
I'll make it over the hump
with any luck at all.

39:31.670 --> 39:39.670
We have a mozzarella
here, a pepperccino.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.689
Tori joins me for a final meal.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.424
This is not a concept that

39:53.425 --> 39:55.826
exists in America, but it is a

39:55.827 --> 39:57.361
concept that should exist.

39:57.362 --> 40:02.099
Okay, now please
explain what it is.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.836
A hotel linked to the territory.

40:05.837 --> 40:13.644
Use local product, local recipe.

40:13.645 --> 40:18.048
Penne, sun dried tomatoes
all from the farm.

40:18.049 --> 40:26.049
Oh, man that looks good.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.828
Wow.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.163
Fantastic.

40:33.164 --> 40:36.200
Some nice olive oil
also from the farm.

40:36.201 --> 40:36.468
More wine.

40:36.469 --> 40:41.472
I might just make it.

40:41.473 --> 40:45.375
This is called agridolce.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.410
It's bitter.

40:46.411 --> 40:49.747
If you talk about Italy, it is

40:49.748 --> 40:54.351
the most interesting
part of Italian cuisine.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.385
Life is too good.

40:55.386 --> 40:57.655
I need a little bitterness to

40:57.656 --> 40:58.823
remind myself of the internal

40:58.824 --> 41:01.158
tragedy of our existence.

41:01.159 --> 41:04.662
The sweet and sour of the life.

41:04.663 --> 41:07.498
One final attempt before I go

41:07.499 --> 41:08.333
to extract something meaningful

41:08.334 --> 41:11.201
on what it means to be Sicilian.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.037
What's wrong with these
people in the north?

41:13.038 --> 41:18.609
People from the south are

41:18.610 --> 41:21.879
coming from these Greek culture

41:21.880 --> 41:26.116
where the philosopher while in

41:26.117 --> 41:29.587
the north came through and
that's the meanest thing

41:29.588 --> 41:29.955
anyone can say.

41:29.956 --> 41:35.059
Oh.

41:35.060 --> 41:38.062
And the last century, the

41:38.063 --> 41:43.801
three best writers in
Italy are from Sicily.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.971
Because they consider us
a weight like problems.

41:46.972 --> 41:48.973
Yet in summers they
all come here.

41:48.974 --> 41:53.310
It's a good thing
for us, you know?

41:53.311 --> 41:58.549
In the end, it all comes
back to the godfather.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.084
We go up this beautiful

42:00.085 --> 42:02.386
mountain, this incredible town.

42:02.387 --> 42:05.890
It goes back to
the 12th century.

42:05.891 --> 42:09.560
There are few places on
earth more beautiful.

42:09.561 --> 42:14.632
But we are sitting in one of

42:14.633 --> 42:21.639
the... it was like a
godfather theme park.

42:21.640 --> 42:26.276
You know, we just look at
people with the godfather

42:26.277 --> 42:26.511
t-shirt.

42:26.512 --> 42:27.978
And say oh, my god.

42:27.979 --> 42:34.451
Why people get stuck on
this, the godfather movie.

42:34.452 --> 42:37.121
Michael had many options.

42:37.122 --> 42:38.623
He destroyed his family.

42:38.624 --> 42:39.790
And everything he touched.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.292
In a way it's fair.

42:42.293 --> 42:43.794
It's fair?

42:43.795 --> 42:47.297
A good movie.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.133
He didn't [ Mute ] it up.

42:48.134 --> 42:51.102
No.
