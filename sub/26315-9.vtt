WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:06.615
Hey, guys, a quick announcement
before we start.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.617
Uh, my firm...

00:08.660 --> 00:10.923
CLASS:
Stone, Gannon and Associates.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.056
Okay, I might have
mentioned it before.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.058
We'’re offering a summer
internship for one-L'’s,

00:15.102 --> 00:17.278
and I'’ve decided
I'’m giving it to someone

00:17.321 --> 00:19.106
in this class.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.369
So this week...CHRISTY:
Oh, my God, I want it.

00:21.412 --> 00:23.153
I'’m gonna get this.

00:23.197 --> 00:26.156
I mean, I-I'’m the best student
in this class.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.245
Who'’s better than me? Glen?

00:28.289 --> 00:33.468
Who wants a lawyer who'’s always
smelling his fingers?

00:33.511 --> 00:36.079
Susan'’s always on her phone.

00:36.123 --> 00:39.648
Joe looks like a little boy
wearing his father'’s suit.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.216
And then there'’s Nick.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.174
What'’s the deal with him?

00:44.218 --> 00:46.046
Some days, he'’s handsome,

00:46.089 --> 00:50.006
some days, he looks
like a giant marionette.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.790
Hmm, come on, focus.

00:51.834 --> 00:53.357
Who am I missing?

00:53.401 --> 00:56.447
Oh, yes. Ha. Lisa.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.841
The know-it-all
who actually knows it all.

00:58.884 --> 01:01.104
Yeah, I'’m thinking
about you, too.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.628
'’Cause I can take you.
'’Cause I'm amazing.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.282
Did I just say that to myself?

01:05.326 --> 01:06.762
Oh, my God, I have confidence
and self-esteem.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.546
When did that kick in?

01:08.590 --> 01:11.332
And I really believe it.
I'’m the best.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.724
I'’m the best.

01:14.987 --> 01:17.686
That'’s right, deal with it.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.644
♪

01:38.924 --> 01:41.753
So I am sitting in
my criminal law class today,

01:41.797 --> 01:43.581
sizing up my competition,

01:43.625 --> 01:46.367
and I realize, out of nowhere,

01:46.410 --> 01:48.108
I am brimming with confidence.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.372
Brim... ming.

01:51.415 --> 01:54.462
Excuse me, Beatrice?

01:54.505 --> 01:57.247
I asked for no mayo.
Guess what I got?

01:57.291 --> 01:58.683
Mayo?

01:58.727 --> 02:00.685
Gobs of it, Bea.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.209
Would you like me
to take it back?

02:02.252 --> 02:03.993
No. I'’m really hungry.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.864
I just wanted to be heard.

02:05.908 --> 02:09.477
Thanks for letting me
be a part of this.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.131
Look at you, taking down a woman

02:11.174 --> 02:12.915
who'’s been on her feet
for 12 hours.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.831
Brimming. No one is safe.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.268
Well, if you'’re still feeling
feisty, you can come over

02:18.312 --> 02:20.270
to my house and give my
gardener the business.

02:20.314 --> 02:23.839
I got mushrooms
on my putting green.

02:23.882 --> 02:26.146
Seems we'’ve finally
turned the corner

02:26.189 --> 02:28.278
from the usual complaints
about law school.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.715
She'’ll circle back.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.717
This week, we'’re
doing a mock trial.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.763
The professor picked
a real court case,

02:34.806 --> 02:37.113
gave us all the files and
we'’re gonna try it ourselves.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.724
Do you get to object?
I'’ve always wanted to object.

02:39.768 --> 02:42.466
What are you talking about?
That'’s all you ever do.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.251
I object.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.862
I wanted more from that.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.472
I got picked to be
the prosecutor,

02:48.516 --> 02:50.648
and this suck-up Lisa
is the defense attorney,

02:50.692 --> 02:54.043
Whoever wins the case is clearly
going to get the internship.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.524
Ooh, smart people cage fight.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.134
[shouts]

02:58.178 --> 03:00.745
Tammy'’s had a toothache
for a couple of days.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.182
It really hurts when I eat.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.401
Yummy, ow, yummy, ow.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.055
Stop eating.

03:06.098 --> 03:09.058
You don'’t stop eating a BLT.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.320
Do you want me to
give you the number

03:10.364 --> 03:12.017
to my dentist?
He'’s really hot.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.237
All your doctors are hot.
Is that how you pick them?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.283
Yeah.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.936
I already have a
dentist appointment.

03:17.980 --> 03:19.286
I was hoping one of you
could take me.

03:19.329 --> 03:20.809
We could make it a day.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.985
How is that a day?

03:23.028 --> 03:27.207
They probably have a fish tank.
Wendy, you brightened a little.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.558
Sorry, I have to work.
Can'’t Marjorie take you?

03:30.601 --> 03:32.429
Nope. Fancy Pantsuit over here

03:32.473 --> 03:34.779
is living it up in
the wilds of Canada.

03:34.823 --> 03:38.087
By "living it up," she means
I'’m speaking to 300 alcoholics.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.349
Tell them what it'’s called.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.917
The Saskatoon Sober Jamboree.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.790
You left out the word "sad."

03:47.401 --> 03:48.880
I'’ll take you
to the dentist, Tammy.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.882
Thanks, Big Sauce.

03:50.926 --> 03:55.147
You know, they don'’t let
just anyone speak at the Jam.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.246
[groans]

04:06.289 --> 04:09.379
No fish tank.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.995
Ooh.

04:17.039 --> 04:20.129
Roasted pork loin with apples.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.870
[lips smacking]

04:25.787 --> 04:27.745
[coughs]

04:31.532 --> 04:34.361
And a lovely side dish.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.277
[coughs]

04:40.192 --> 04:42.717
Some people just take a picture.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.719
I left my phone in the car.

04:44.762 --> 04:47.025
Why do you think
I'’m looking at a magazine?

04:47.069 --> 04:49.550
Let'’s get out of here.You'’re done already?

04:49.593 --> 04:51.116
They haven'’t even started.
They want to knock me out.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.031
For a toothache?

04:53.075 --> 04:56.252
Oh, no, we'’re way past that.
My mouth is a disaster.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.036
There'’s gum scraping,
root canals.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.300
They want to yank one clean out.

05:00.343 --> 05:03.215
Oh, man.I told them I'’m sober
and I can'’t be put under.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.130
Well, sure you can.
There'’s no part of the program

05:05.174 --> 05:06.915
that says you'’re supposed
to suffer.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.047
You know, unless you end up
in Canada with Marjorie.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.571
[laughs, groans]

05:10.614 --> 05:13.530
Oh, no, no.
Go tell the dentist it'’s okay.

05:13.574 --> 05:15.837
But then they want to give me
a prescription for pain pills.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.708
You can take pills,
but you got to be careful.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.797
Those things are tricky.Right, right. Uh...

05:19.841 --> 05:21.712
I'’ll just stick with the
Tylenol. I mean, it got me

05:21.756 --> 05:23.279
through getting stabbed
in the leg with a fork,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.325
it'’ll get me through this.Wow.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.152
Your time inside was rough.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.329
Oh, no, that wasn'’t prison.
I was trying to kill a seagull

05:29.372 --> 05:31.069
that landed in my lap.

05:34.377 --> 05:36.379
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

05:36.423 --> 05:38.599
the facts of this case
are clear.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.688
There is ample evidence that...

05:40.731 --> 05:42.951
[moans]

05:42.994 --> 05:45.127
Am I moving my hands too much?

05:45.170 --> 05:46.737
I didn'’t hear a word you said.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.913
I was mesmerized by how good
you look in my suit.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.873
What do you think?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.701
Well, I-I don'’t know.
Angie Harmon used to move

05:53.744 --> 05:55.267
her arms around a lot
on Law & Order.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.576
Wha-- She still on that show?

05:59.620 --> 06:02.579
No, it got canceled.
She went to Rizzoli & Isles.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.841
Well, that'’s not on anymore,
either.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.888
Should we be worried about her?

06:06.931 --> 06:10.674
Guys, can we worry about my
career and not Angie Harmon'’s?

06:10.718 --> 06:12.546
Uh, it'’s gonna be fine.
You'’re gonna do great.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.416
JILL:
Oh, my God.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.504
Angie got divorced.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.551
That woman can'’t catch a break.

06:17.594 --> 06:20.641
Tammy'’s still asleep.
She'’s a bit of a drooler.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.164
You'’re gonna need
to change your sheets.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.209
Maybe even the mattress.

06:24.253 --> 06:27.038
Great. But she better be up
before I go to bed tonight.

06:27.082 --> 06:28.562
I have a really big day
tomorrow.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.563
Eh, you say that
every day. You'’re like

06:29.606 --> 06:31.042
the girl who cried "big day."

06:31.086 --> 06:33.654
Well, this time it really is.

06:33.697 --> 06:36.308
Tomorrow'’s the mock trial
and I'’m completely unprepared

06:36.352 --> 06:38.441
and I'’m gonna lose
to know-it-all Lisa.

06:38.485 --> 06:39.964
Yesterday, you said, and
I quote, you were gonna

06:40.008 --> 06:42.706
"bitch slap her with the law."

06:42.750 --> 06:45.013
Then I remembered
she went to private school

06:45.056 --> 06:49.887
her whole life, aced her LSATs
and I'’m me, daughter of you.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.587
Oh, thank God.What?

06:53.630 --> 06:56.241
Angie got a miniseries
and a new guy.

06:58.592 --> 06:59.767
Christy,
I think you'’ve got this.

06:59.810 --> 07:00.898
That drug dealer'’s going down.

07:00.942 --> 07:02.944
Whoa, whoa.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.468
Your case is about a drug
dealer? What are the facts?

07:05.512 --> 07:08.689
The cops found the drugs
locked in a car in his driveway

07:08.732 --> 07:10.778
but his defense is
it'’s not his car.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.997
That'’s the oldest trick in
the book. Remember Oklahoma?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.869
When I bought that
beat-up old Monte Carlo,

07:14.912 --> 07:16.740
registered it
to a dead guy...

07:16.784 --> 07:18.786
And stashed your drugs in it,
so nothing could be tied

07:18.829 --> 07:20.048
to your name.
That'’s what this guy's doing.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.266
That'’s my girl.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.791
Well, this is scary.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.837
The upsetting part of the story
is they lived in Oklahoma.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.187
I mean, just move to Texas.
It'’s right there.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.493
TAMMY:
Tylenol!

07:30.537 --> 07:32.800
Tammy'’s up.Tylenol!

07:32.843 --> 07:34.715
It hurts!It'’s okay, it's right here.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.978
Ooh, hurry!

07:37.021 --> 07:39.328
Please do what she says.

07:39.371 --> 07:41.852
They don'’t make this easy.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.201
What'’s the problem?It'’s sealed so kids don't get...

07:43.245 --> 07:45.595
Oh, I know why.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.597
Ah, another seal.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.120
Oh, just jam
your finger into it.

07:49.164 --> 07:52.950
Oh, see, now I just pushed
the cotton down further.

07:52.994 --> 07:54.996
Christy, you'’ve got
the little monkey hands.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.259
Can you get it out?

07:57.302 --> 07:59.348
[sighs]
My past is an asset,

07:59.391 --> 08:01.045
my tiny hands are an asset.

08:01.089 --> 08:03.221
Everything'’s coming up Christy.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.006
No!
Tammy!

08:05.049 --> 08:06.398
What?

08:06.442 --> 08:07.835
Spit those out.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.577
Spit those out right now. Do it.

08:16.844 --> 08:17.975
All of them.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.772
Here'’s two.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.208
Might be three.
They'’re kind of stuck together.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.218
Look at all these stupid people.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.611
Why are they in front of us?

08:44.654 --> 08:46.264
Because they got here first.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.266
That doesn'’t seem fair.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.530
I'’m looking for some pain pills!

08:50.573 --> 08:52.793
Last name'’s Diffendorf!

08:52.836 --> 08:54.446
Why don'’t you go over there
and check your blood pressure

08:54.490 --> 08:56.057
on that super cool machine?

08:56.100 --> 08:57.493
How'’s that gonna
make me feel better?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.844
It won'’t, but it's over there.

09:00.888 --> 09:03.847
Diffendorf!

09:06.197 --> 09:07.416
Bonnie?

09:07.459 --> 09:08.809
Oh, thank God you answered.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.027
You'’re never happy
to talk to me.

09:10.071 --> 09:12.029
What'’s wrong? Are the cats okay?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.814
The cats are fine. It'’s the
other animal you live with

09:13.857 --> 09:15.380
that I'’m worried about.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.165
Tammy'’s mouth
is a complete teardown.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.428
She needs hardcore painkillers
to get her through the weekend.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.951
When do you get home?

09:20.995 --> 09:22.953
Not till Tuesday.What?

09:22.997 --> 09:25.303
I'’m 300/10. What does that mean?

09:27.915 --> 09:30.134
She needs a responsible
sober person

09:30.178 --> 09:32.484
to hold the pills for her.
Can'’t you come home early?

09:32.528 --> 09:35.270
No. I made a commitment
to a lot of people

09:35.313 --> 09:37.098
who are counting on me
being here.

09:37.141 --> 09:39.927
[laughs]:
Oh! Oh, Wayne, you devil.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.233
[laughs]

09:42.277 --> 09:44.192
I got to go.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.632
What? Who'’s Wayne?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.025
What are you here for?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.287
Cholesterol.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.071
Cut back on your butter.
Get behind me.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.290
You?

09:55.333 --> 09:56.204
I'’d rather not say.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.945
Got it. Boner pills.

09:57.988 --> 10:00.469
You'’re behind me, too.
And keep your eyes up.

10:00.512 --> 10:03.167
Come on, Bonnie. Everyone'’s cool
with us cutting in line.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.735
I'’m sorry, excuse me. My
friend is in a lot of pain.

10:05.779 --> 10:08.738
Excuse me. Hey, she
said eyes up, pops.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.661
Bonnie, wake up.
It'’s time. I need my pill.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.489
It-it hasn'’t been six hours.

10:20.532 --> 10:23.100
Five and a half is close enough.
My face is gonna fall off.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.754
Give her a pill or give me one.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.277
It'’s important to wait.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.627
Look,
I'’ll tell you what.

10:27.670 --> 10:29.063
I-I'’ll help you kill the time.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.673
How about we go play Clue?
You love Clue.

10:30.717 --> 10:32.327
Who did it? We don'’t know.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.329
I do love Clue.

10:34.372 --> 10:36.113
But you can'’t play
with two people.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.072
Oh, Adam can play. He'’s up.No he'’s not.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.552
But he could be.No, he couldn'’t.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.251
I'’ll go wake up Christy
and see if she wants to play.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.427
No. She'’s got a big day.Oh, she always says that.

10:47.951 --> 10:51.999
No further questions,
Your Honor.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.654
Thank you, Lisa.
Christy, your witness.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.569
Thank you, Your Honor.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.789
Good afternoon, Glen.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.573
Sup?

11:01.617 --> 11:03.663
Curious choice of hat.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.839
I thought it would
make me look street.

11:05.882 --> 11:09.712
Ha. Let the record reflect
it does not.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.627
Christy, can we move this along?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.412
It'’s your contention

11:14.456 --> 11:17.633
that you are not, in fact,
a drug dealer, correct?

11:17.677 --> 11:18.895
That'’s right.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.418
Hmm.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.682
And yet a car parked
in your driveway

11:22.725 --> 11:26.163
was found to contain
nine kilos of cocaine.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.556
It'’s my Uncle Ronnie's car.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.037
Oh. Would that be

11:30.080 --> 11:33.344
Ronald Williams,
who died in 2008?

11:34.824 --> 11:37.131
Why are you holding
onto his car?

11:37.174 --> 11:40.177
I'’m a sentimental guy, yo.

11:40.221 --> 11:41.222
Your Honor?

11:41.265 --> 11:43.050
Knock it off, Glen.

11:43.093 --> 11:46.880
Sorry, it'’s just so fun.

11:46.923 --> 11:50.753
This phone was on your person
when you were arrested.

11:50.797 --> 11:54.017
It'’s a 20-year-old Nokia 8265.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.497
Is this your phone?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.499
Yes.Hmm.

11:57.542 --> 11:59.283
I'’d think you'd have
a smartphone,

11:59.327 --> 12:01.329
cool guy like you
with a cool hat.

12:01.372 --> 12:06.203
Uh, I like to kick it
old school?

12:06.247 --> 12:09.903
Or is it because an old phone
like this has no GPS,

12:09.946 --> 12:13.776
making it impossible for the
police to track your movements?

12:13.820 --> 12:18.085
Is it because, in fact,
this phone is widely used

12:18.128 --> 12:21.479
by drug dealers everywhere
for exactly those reasons?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.481
Objection.
She'’s making an argument.

12:23.525 --> 12:27.311
Your Honor, the defendant claims
he is not a drug dealer,

12:27.355 --> 12:29.574
but he hides drugs
like a drug dealer,

12:29.618 --> 12:32.142
he uses an old phone
like a drug dealer.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.928
He rents multiple motel rooms

12:34.971 --> 12:37.931
to avoid search warrants
like a drug dealer.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.107
Where'’d she get all of this?
None of it was in the file.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.065
It was all in the file, but
your childhood was too happy

12:42.109 --> 12:43.327
for you to see it.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.809
What'’s that supposed to mean?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.420
It means this is the
world I grew up in.

12:49.464 --> 12:50.900
My mother was a drug dealer, yo.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.120
And to be honest,

12:53.163 --> 12:55.775
I'’ve had my share
of dark years, too.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.515
Do you ever wonder why I'’m
the oldest one in this class?

12:57.559 --> 12:58.908
I did.Me, too.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.911
I wondered as well,
but I'’m not allowed to ask.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.218
'’Cause it was a long road
to get here.

13:04.261 --> 13:07.047
I-I drank, I did drugs,
I was a stripper.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.440
That has nothing to do with
this, but now it'’s out there.

13:09.484 --> 13:12.530
Point is,

13:12.574 --> 13:16.447
I-I know how drug dealers work,
and this scumbag is guilty.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.710
[sighs]

13:18.754 --> 13:21.017
The prosecution rests.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.632
FYI, my parents got divorced
and they used me as a weapon,

13:27.676 --> 13:29.025
so whatever.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.857
[moaning]

13:34.901 --> 13:36.511
[sobbing]

13:36.554 --> 13:38.121
Hey, sounds like
you'’re doing better.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.776
I'’m not.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.083
Well, you'’ve got a while before
the next pill, but until then,

13:43.126 --> 13:44.911
I'’ve got ice cream,
pudding and apple sauce.

13:44.954 --> 13:46.564
Give me pudding.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.088
Chocolate or
butterscotch?

13:48.131 --> 13:50.873
Chocolate.
Don'’t ask dumb questions.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.876
Fine. More
butterscotch for me.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.662
You know, the whole
world'’s missing out.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.840
[whispering]:
Yes.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.625
No.

14:03.668 --> 14:05.192
Come on, Tammy, dig deep.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.804
Use as directed.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.155
"Every four hours"?

14:12.199 --> 14:14.418
Hey, Tammy, I took a shot
at some Cool Whip.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.246
Thought it might jazz up
your pudding...

14:16.290 --> 14:19.162
Four hours! Every four hours!

14:19.206 --> 14:21.643
Not six, not five.

14:21.686 --> 14:23.863
Four!
Okay, okay.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.343
Let'’s just keep this table
between us and I'’ll explain.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.041
While it'’s technically true

14:28.084 --> 14:29.607
you can have a pill
every four hours,

14:29.651 --> 14:31.000
I made an executive decision

14:31.044 --> 14:32.001
to see if we could
stretch it to six,

14:32.045 --> 14:33.133
and I think we'’re doing great.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.656
Why would you make me suffer?

14:34.699 --> 14:36.440
Because I love you.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.574
You do?

14:39.617 --> 14:41.184
O-Of course.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.449
[sighs]
Come here.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.974
I still think you can last
six hours.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.714
You'’re a dead woman!

14:49.758 --> 14:52.413
Stop putting furniture
between us.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.330
I'’ve done this
with cops for hours.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.944
I can go all night.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.994
I just feel so lost right now.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.562
I thought I could trust you.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.087
You'’re the closest thing
I have to a sister.

15:14.130 --> 15:17.699
You can trust me.

15:17.742 --> 15:21.485
I'’m really just trying
to protect you.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.966
These pills can be
really dangerous.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.056
I know, I'’m just-- headlock!

15:29.363 --> 15:31.104
Ow!

15:31.147 --> 15:33.410
[gasps]
That was so mean.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.543
You put me in a headlock.That was a hug.

15:35.586 --> 15:36.674
You yelled "headlock!"

15:43.029 --> 15:47.990
Tammy, a couple years
ago, I hurt my back.

15:48.034 --> 15:51.820
They gave me these things and I
was convinced I could handle it.

15:51.863 --> 15:54.997
But it wasn'’t long before
one pill every four hours

15:55.041 --> 15:57.695
became four pills
every one hour.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.046
I'’m sorry, but this disease
is a sneaky little bitch,

16:00.089 --> 16:01.786
and I just don'’t want
you to wake her up.

16:03.745 --> 16:06.095
I hate you right now.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.097
And I love you.

16:08.141 --> 16:11.013
I definitely
don'’t want to relapse.

16:11.057 --> 16:13.842
So it'’s been four hours.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.539
Do you want a pill?

16:15.583 --> 16:19.630
No. I'’m gonna try
to make it six.

16:19.674 --> 16:22.851
Five and a half.

16:22.894 --> 16:25.027
Here you go.
Thank you.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.423
You wanted to see me?

16:29.466 --> 16:31.077
Yes, Christy.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.296
Thanks for coming.
Look, you did a really great job

16:33.340 --> 16:34.863
the other day.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.344
I mean,
I think Glen is still weeping.

16:37.387 --> 16:42.610
Yeah. I think I saw
his hat in the trash.

16:42.653 --> 16:46.266
So listen, I want to talk
to you about the internship.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.050
Oh, really?

16:48.094 --> 16:50.487
The internship. I totally
forgot about that.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.881
I'’m giving it to Lisa.

16:52.924 --> 16:56.972
What? No. I destroyed her
in mock trial.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.192
I know you did, but...I know what'’s going on here.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.585
You find out I have
a sketchy past,

17:01.629 --> 17:04.414
and all of a sudden, I am not
welcome at your snooty law firm.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.676
Christy, if you would
allow me...

17:05.720 --> 17:07.374
I worked my ass off to get here.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.245
And yes, I said "ass,"
I was a stripper.

17:09.289 --> 17:12.466
I don'’t know why I
keep bringing that up.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.250
My law firm would
like to offer you

17:14.294 --> 17:16.687
a paying position this summer.

17:16.731 --> 17:21.649
Oh, my God. Thank you.

17:21.692 --> 17:25.044
I'’m not allowed to hug you back,
but congratulations.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.524
Right, right.

17:33.617 --> 17:36.577
I just want to get something
off my chest.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.579
For three years,
I have misled you all

17:38.622 --> 17:40.363
into believing
something about me.

17:40.407 --> 17:44.193
She used to be a
man. I told you.

17:44.237 --> 17:48.415
This is very difficult to say,

17:48.458 --> 17:51.635
but I, um,

17:51.679 --> 17:55.074
I never actually watched
Breaking Bad.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.337
[all oohing]I know, I know,

17:57.380 --> 17:59.469
but I just couldn'’t get into it.

17:59.513 --> 18:04.474
And every time you guys talked
about it, I-I was faking.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.085
You'’d all be like,

18:06.128 --> 18:07.825
"Heisenberg" and "Jesse,"
and I'’d say,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.566
"Yes, great episode."

18:11.568 --> 18:15.964
Anyway, weight lifted. Thanks.

18:19.185 --> 18:21.535
You better not be
lying about Cake Wars.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.494
Of course not.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.717
Would anyone else
like to share?

18:29.760 --> 18:33.460
Hey, everybody. I am awesome.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.462
Sorry, just wanted
to let you know.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.464
Now I have to go
to Gamblers Anonymous. See you.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.903
Does anybody else think

18:41.946 --> 18:44.384
confident Christy
is super annoying?

18:44.427 --> 18:47.300
I'’ll go. Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.

18:47.343 --> 18:50.129
GROUP: Hi, Bonnie.I know you don'’t
hear this a lot from me,

18:50.172 --> 18:51.913
but I am really proud of myself.

18:56.004 --> 18:59.181
I have a sober friend
who had dental work done

18:59.225 --> 19:01.314
and needed pain pills.She'’s talking about me.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.580
And I was the one
who held them for her.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.886
Now, the amazing thing is,
the whole time,

19:08.930 --> 19:11.889
I never once thought
about taking a pill myself.

19:11.933 --> 19:15.154
All I could think about was
taking care of my friend.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.895
And it led me to a discovery,
one that I have mastered,

19:17.939 --> 19:19.680
but I think the rest of you
are ready for.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.073
This program

19:22.117 --> 19:24.075
is really about helping
other people,

19:24.119 --> 19:28.428
and by helping other people,
I helped myself.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.650
Think about that.

19:37.001 --> 19:39.395
And if I'’m the first person
to recognize that,

19:39.439 --> 19:41.963
let it be my gift to you.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.707
I'’m going back to Canada.
