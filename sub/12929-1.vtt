00:26.993 --> 00:29.862
         Harvey Johnson
     came into the library,

00:29.864 --> 00:31.597
        said he saw an ad
         for Unit Four.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.699
                Mm, I rented it.

00:33.701 --> 00:34.833
          This morning.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.635
         A new professor
       at the university.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.270
         Very handsome.

00:39.639 --> 00:40.672
            I told him that, uh,

00:40.674 --> 00:41.907
                you'd stop by
                tomorrow morning

00:41.909 --> 00:44.176
          and give him his keys.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.310
  Are you trying to set us up?

00:46.446 --> 00:48.147
     Aurora, I would never.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.616
         Yes, you would.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.618
          Yes, I would.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.154
    Aw, but I'm still hoping
  that you'll get back together

00:55.156 --> 00:56.488
       with Father Aubrey.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.689
No...

00:57.691 --> 00:59.058
           Aw, I had such
           lovely visions of you

00:59.060 --> 01:00.959
           as a minister's wife.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.062
No, Scott was very sweet,

01:03.064 --> 01:04.830
but we had
nothing in common.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.932
    That's beside the point.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.568
                   A smart woman

01:09.570 --> 01:12.071
    learns to feign interest
     in what her man likes.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.041
      Oh, so then you'll be
at the Real Murders Club meeting

01:16.043 --> 01:17.743
            tonight?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.978
  Because John is giving a talk
  on the Julia Wallace murder.

01:19.980 --> 01:21.814
     I'm sure he would love
       to have you there.

01:21.816 --> 01:23.048
      I'm sure he'd rather
          pine for me.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.851
              You might actually

01:25.853 --> 01:27.853
            find it
            interesting, Mother.

01:27.855 --> 01:29.221
                   The husband
                   was convicted

01:29.223 --> 01:31.156
               even though there
               was no evidence.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.459
No, thank you.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.661
Now, don't forget
about the new tenant.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.596
I told him 9:00 a.m.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.431
      Yeah. I won't forget.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.071
                   Hi, Bankston!

01:47.474 --> 01:48.774
            Oh, hey.

01:48.776 --> 01:49.875
      Okay, see you later.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.009
         I'm just going
       to pick up Melanie.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.277
    Oh, it's Wallace tonight.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.780
             I know.
  We're looking forward to it.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.781
       I'll see you there.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.015
                      See?

01:57.017 --> 01:58.884
     Bankston and his girlfriend
     go to meetings.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.752
Real Murders Club
is a hot date, Mom.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.154
You should try it.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.123
          Clearly, I have failed
          in teaching you

02:04.125 --> 02:05.724
        what constitutes a date.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.860
        But do tell John
      I wanted to be there.

02:08.863 --> 02:10.195
        That'd be lying.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.831
       No, feigning, dear,

02:12.833 --> 02:14.133
                       feigning.

02:17.804 --> 02:18.937
           Hey, Sally.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.038
     Hey, get to the meeting
        early if you can.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.773
   I have a surprise for you.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.776
     Oh, no, Sally, you know
   how I feel about surprises.

02:24.778 --> 02:25.944
 Yeah, I know, but you're going
        to love this one.

02:27.548 --> 02:28.514
No, why don't you
just tell me?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.215
Tell me what it is.

02:30.217 --> 02:31.517
      <i> You are so stubborn.</i>

02:31.519 --> 02:32.518
      Just get there early.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.720
              Bye!

02:49.135 --> 02:51.170
        ...Well, I better
       get going, Melissa.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.938
 We have a club meeting tonight,

02:52.940 --> 02:56.141
    and LeMaster's coming by
   for the keys to the hall...

02:56.143 --> 02:58.177
    Yeah, I'll see you soon.

02:58.179 --> 03:01.280
 Gerald, it's roasting in here.

03:01.282 --> 03:05.017
        Can we turn down
       the fires, please?

03:05.019 --> 03:06.418
             Gerald?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.054
             Honey?

03:13.092 --> 03:14.860
     "You were on the phone.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.261
   "Had to meet a new client.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.830
           See you at
      the Veteran's Hall."

03:19.934 --> 03:22.201
         You know I hate
        driving at night.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.704
   Ah, LeMaster, you're early.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.741
          Okay, Gerald,
   where'd you leave the keys?

03:29.743 --> 03:30.842
               Oh.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.585
  Oh, what are you doing here?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.220
         You look awful.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.788
         Here, come in.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.190
      I'm making sandwiches
        if you're hungry.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.293
 What on earth are you holding?

03:48.295 --> 03:50.095
What are you--

04:18.692 --> 04:19.891
       He's a cute little thing.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.761
        That's a fierce watchdog
        you have there.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.264
Oh, yeah.
       Totally savage.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.875
         Gerald? Mamie?

04:36.877 --> 04:39.144
         It's LeMaster,
       here for the keys.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.782
        Mamie? Mamie? No!

04:52.692 --> 04:54.793
Hey, why haven't
you gone in?

04:54.795 --> 04:55.827
                    It's locked.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.095
LeMaster
isn't here yet?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.430
                  Nope.

04:58.432 --> 04:59.665
     Aren't you at least curious
     about your surprise?

04:59.667 --> 05:00.999
                I mean, come on,
                have a guess.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.335
   You got me a card that says

05:03.337 --> 05:04.870
           I can pass
     on your guessing games.

05:04.872 --> 05:05.771
          Guess again.

05:07.206 --> 05:09.074
   You got me a kit I can use
         to make a card

05:09.076 --> 05:10.709
that says I can pass
on your guessing games.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.010
            You know
     you're spoiling my fun.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.011
       Oh, hi, Uncle John.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.379
      Hi.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.014
        Can't wait to be dazzled
        by your talk tonight.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.082
                  My mother says

05:17.084 --> 05:17.983
                 she wishes
                 she could come,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.184
but she was only feigning.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.186
A man appreciates
a little polite pretense

05:21.188 --> 05:22.287
     now and then.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.256
And we're not going
inside because...

05:24.258 --> 05:25.457
         LeMaster hasn't
     shown up with the key.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.892
     And he's not answering.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.329
I made a copy of the key
for just such an occasion

05:30.331 --> 05:31.396
back when I was president.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.432
     But don't tell Gerald.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.200
Don't tell Gerald what?

05:38.237 --> 05:40.038
           Hi, Gerald.

05:40.040 --> 05:40.939
      Roe.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.375
Good to see you all.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.077
John, where'd you
get the key?

05:45.079 --> 05:46.611
LeMaster was supposed
to pick it up.

05:50.983 --> 05:52.818
            What's your position
            on polite pretense?

05:58.825 --> 06:00.292
 So you're really not gonna take
  a guess about your surprise?

06:00.294 --> 06:02.928
         I'm really not.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.763
        Where are
        the creamers and sugars?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.332
                   That's weird,

06:07.334 --> 06:09.368
                    that phone
                    never rings.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.435
             Hello.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.837
    <i> Is Julia Wallace there?</i>

06:11.839 --> 06:13.038
              What?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.174
        That was creepy.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.576
       Someone just asked
       for Julia Wallace.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.378
   The victim John is supposed
     to talk about tonight?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.179
            Exactly.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.914
           That wasn't
     your surprise, was it?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.015
               No.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.117
      No, that was a prank.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.058
             Dory, those cookies
             smell delicious.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.359
Chocolate chip.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.027
I had to make a bunch
for my son's class party

06:36.029 --> 06:37.062
and made extra.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.063
Have one.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.433
                     Mm.

06:41.435 --> 06:42.868
                    Oh, you two,

06:42.870 --> 06:43.802
         you have to try
     some of Dory's cookies.

06:43.804 --> 06:44.803
       They're to die for.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.271
Cookies, great.
Thanks.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.708
   The cookies are not a part
of your workout program, though.

06:56.783 --> 06:57.716
           Who's that?

07:01.822 --> 07:03.088
       I know who that is.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.123
Surprise.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.825
              What?
       That's my surprise?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.026
                  Robin Daniels?

07:08.028 --> 07:08.994
              Hey.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.228
       What, the mystery writer?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.063
And Roe's
favorite writer.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.965
At least I think he's still
your favorite writer--

07:13.967 --> 07:15.033
       Yes, yes.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.335
       He is amazing,
       brilliant.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.237
Hi.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.205
              Hi, Robin,
              thanks for coming.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.907
Sally. Thanks
for having me.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.176
So, this is the friend
that I was telling you about.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.877
Roe Teagarden.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.379
                  Roe, this is
                  Robin Daniels.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.214
             I know!
     I know. I'm a huge fan.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.215
      I mean, I'm a big...

07:30.217 --> 07:32.250
                   inspired fan.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.885
 Oh, that's nice of you to say.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.921
      Sally seems to think
     that I'll become a fan

07:35.923 --> 07:37.088
of your club here.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.057
             Oh. Yeah,
             how did you guys...

07:39.059 --> 07:40.192
          He's a friend
           of Macon's.

07:40.194 --> 07:42.027
     My editor at the paper.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.462
                 Oh.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.963
          Yeah, we went
      to college together.

07:44.965 --> 07:45.931
                      Yes,

07:45.933 --> 07:47.199
            and Robin is in town

07:47.201 --> 07:48.366
               teaching
               at the university

07:48.368 --> 07:49.901
                    for the next
                    few months,

07:49.903 --> 07:51.169
       and he asked me if I knew
       any nice places to rent,

07:51.171 --> 07:52.337
              so I gave him
              your mom's number.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.939
She got me
a short-term lease

07:53.941 --> 07:55.540
on this great townhouse.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.876
   Oh, you're the new tenant.

07:57.878 --> 07:58.877
Yeah.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.045
    I'm the property manager.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.213
            I live right nearby.

08:01.215 --> 08:03.315
         Oh. Well then,
    we were destined to meet.

08:03.317 --> 08:05.350
         Well, come meet
       our other neighbor.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.351
Sure.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.986
    This is Bankston Waites.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.254
                          Hello.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.322
And his girlfriend
Melanie Clark.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.122
              -Hi.
              -Hi.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.393
And there's Arthur.
What's he doing here?

08:15.395 --> 08:16.595
Is he rejoining
the club?

08:16.597 --> 08:17.829
        Oh, I don't know.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.531
        I'll go find out.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.032
            Who's he?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.367
  Oh, he's a police detective.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.435
          And Roe's ex.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.036
              -Hey!
              -Hey.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.204
        Please tell me you're
        coming back to the club.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.272
Uh...

08:27.274 --> 08:29.875
           We're here
    in an official capacity.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.643
              "We?"

08:31.645 --> 08:33.311
                         Lynn...

08:36.349 --> 08:38.383
     Wait, what's going on?

08:38.385 --> 08:41.052
Um, Lynn needs
to talk to Gerald.

08:44.056 --> 08:45.257
              But if you want to
              talk to him...

08:45.259 --> 08:47.526
 You're a homicide detective...

08:47.528 --> 08:49.327
      Unless you've changed
      your name to Gerald,

08:49.329 --> 08:50.562
             we have
      no business with you.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.330
        Which one is he?

08:52.332 --> 08:53.765
Um... he's right there.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.202
               Oh.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.337
Oh, Arthur, please don't tell me
   this has to do with Mamie.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.412
Mr. Wright?
Detective Liggett Smith.

09:07.414 --> 09:08.947
Do you think we could
go somewhere

09:08.949 --> 09:10.515
           and speak in private?

09:10.517 --> 09:13.218
             -Sure.
    -What is Lynn doing here?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.055
              Wait.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.257
    LeMaster was supposed to
  get the key from their house.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.225
     He hasn't shown up yet.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.259
        Is he all right?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.327
        LeMaster is fine.

09:22.329 --> 09:23.295
         He's shaken up,

09:23.297 --> 09:24.663
but fine.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.831
           Shaken up?
       Did he find the...

09:28.568 --> 09:29.668
            Arthur, you're back.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.404
                 And you brought
                 your wife.

09:35.007 --> 09:38.043
             Oh, you aren't here
             for the meeting.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.445
       Unfortunately not.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.650
               Wonder what
               that's all about.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.219
It's gotta be
about Mamie, right?

09:48.221 --> 09:49.688
                   Do you think
                   she was hurt?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.691
Whatever it is,
it seems pretty serious.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.428
      Oh gosh, I hope not.
      I really like Mamie.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.263
             Oh, no,
             look at Roe's face.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.865
                    This is bad.

10:03.035 --> 10:04.336
                            Roe?

10:08.574 --> 10:10.075
        Is there anything
      that you can tell us?

10:10.077 --> 10:11.977
        Mamie and Gerald
        are our friends.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.446
It's not my place.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.348
                What is it?
                What's going on?

10:16.350 --> 10:19.584
Mamie's been...

10:19.586 --> 10:21.486
        She was attacked.
            Homicide.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.523
                   That's awful.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.193
She was a nice lady.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.527
She certainly
didn't deserve

10:29.529 --> 10:32.230
        to get bludgeoned
 in front of her own fireplace.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.099
     That's how it happened?

10:35.801 --> 10:38.203
       It's... it's really
    not my place to divulge--

10:38.205 --> 10:39.371
  Sally, please don't quote me.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.406
Quote you? No.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.540
     Are there any suspects?

10:44.543 --> 10:46.411
        Detective Smith?

10:46.413 --> 10:47.512
Patterson's
on the radio.

10:47.514 --> 10:48.513
           What is it?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.547
He wants to know

10:49.549 --> 10:50.682
 if he should bag the raincoat,

10:50.684 --> 10:51.716
     or wait for the husband
           to I.D. it.

10:51.718 --> 10:53.284
      Wait, what raincoat?

10:53.286 --> 10:54.753
            Raincoat?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.454
  Oh, there was a raincoat
  crumpled under Mamie's body.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.456
I'll talk to Patterson.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.658
Uh, guys,

10:59.660 --> 11:01.192
you're probably gonna
wanna cancel the meeting.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.395
      Send everybody home.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.532
       Roe, do you want to
       announce we're done here,

11:07.534 --> 11:09.100
                     or shall I?

11:10.736 --> 11:12.137
    Is everything all right?

11:12.139 --> 11:13.805
Did you hear
what Arthur just said?

11:13.807 --> 11:16.675
           A raincoat
    was crumpled under Mamie.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.377
By a fireplace.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.012
     The Julia Wallace case.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.614
Yeah.

11:22.616 --> 11:24.549
         The phone call.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.518
That voice

11:26.520 --> 11:28.219
      that asked for Julia.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.120
    I have to go tell Arthur.

11:32.658 --> 11:36.127
        Is she always two steps
        ahead of everybody else?

11:36.129 --> 11:37.529
Generally, yes.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.335
           Yeah, okay.
           Copy that.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.537
    Arthur, there's something
        you need to know.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.505
What is it, Roe?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.207
           15 minutes
       before our meeting,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.643
       someone called here
  and asked for Julia Wallace.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.311
                   The victim
                   in the murder

11:53.313 --> 11:54.279
       we were supposed to
        discuss tonight.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.280
   Do you remember that case?

11:55.282 --> 11:57.148
                  England, 1934?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.316
      Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
         Vaguely, yeah.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.751
      Husband convicted of
      bludgeoning his wife?

11:59.753 --> 12:01.319
    In front of a fireplace,

12:01.321 --> 12:02.487
      on top of a raincoat.

12:03.689 --> 12:06.157
      Wait, are you saying
   what I think you're saying?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.460
    I'm saying what happened
     to Mamie was a copycat.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.661
           I'm saying

12:09.663 --> 12:11.896
    I think whoever did this
      was someone who knew

12:11.898 --> 12:13.498
        what our meeting
   was gonna be about tonight.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.700
                      Arthur,

12:15.702 --> 12:16.835
          I think Mamie's killer

12:16.837 --> 12:18.603
        could be a member
    of the Real Murders Club.

12:18.605 --> 12:19.838
     Lynn needs to know now.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.239
Call Captain Burns,

12:21.241 --> 12:22.607
get some back-up
down here.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.409
And don't let anybody
outside that building!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.077
We gotta question everyone.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.350
What in the world
did Roe tell the police

12:32.352 --> 12:34.352
   to have them round us up
    like prisoners of war?

12:34.354 --> 12:35.887
Hey, so can I get
my phone back or what?

12:35.889 --> 12:38.289
       'Cause I'm for sure
      gonna call a lawyer!

12:40.192 --> 12:41.726
           Call away.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.328
           Now, we're
       going to be asking

12:43.330 --> 12:45.296
      a few basic questions
       of you all tonight,

12:45.298 --> 12:47.432
  so if anyone else would like
      their lawyer present,

12:47.434 --> 12:49.501
     you can use that phone
   when Perry is done with it.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.809
I've never been questioned
by the police before.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.178
You can't buy
this kind of research.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.587
    Photos are coming through
           right now.

13:11.690 --> 13:13.858
     See? That. Right there.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.393
You see that?

13:15.395 --> 13:17.428
The victim's arm,

13:17.430 --> 13:18.663
it's bent

13:18.665 --> 13:21.432
just like the crime scene
photo of Julia Wallace.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.534
                  She was posed?

13:24.303 --> 13:27.705
    You know, Mamie's husband
    is an insurance salesman.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.774
        Just like
        Julia Wallace's husband.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.177
 How do you announce the subject
   of discussion of your club?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.546
Post it online,
put it in the paper, what?

13:34.548 --> 13:35.547
           I send a group email.

13:35.549 --> 13:36.948
So only club members
would have known

13:36.950 --> 13:38.917
the Wallace thing was
on your agenda tonight?

13:38.919 --> 13:41.853
  Well, anyone connected
  to a club member

13:41.855 --> 13:43.321
        might also know.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.322
     I mean, they would have
       seen a flyer maybe?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.723
  No, we don't pass out flyers.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.825
  That would require a budget.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.828
         And that would
         require a club

13:49.830 --> 13:51.663
           that wasn't
      a ridiculous exercise

13:51.665 --> 13:53.464
    in pretend investigating.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.135
        Just an opinion.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.205
      Tell me what you know
       about the husband.

14:00.207 --> 14:01.706
             Gerald?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.909
        <i> Oh, he and Mamie</i>
  <i> would never miss a meeting.</i>

14:04.911 --> 14:06.578
      <i> It was kind of cute</i>

14:06.580 --> 14:07.745
   <i> they way they'd argue over</i>
<i>who was the more likely suspect</i>

14:07.747 --> 14:08.713
           <i> in a case.</i>

14:08.715 --> 14:09.747
They argued?

14:09.749 --> 14:11.516
       No, I meant debate.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.251
       Like a fun debate.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.453
        Look, I know that
 he's the most obvious suspect.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.955
             The husbands
             usually are, right?

14:16.957 --> 14:18.790
But no, Gerald, he adored Mamie.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.258
        He would never--

14:20.260 --> 14:22.694
 We decide who our suspects are,
            not you.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.541
Oh, did you get
any sleep?

14:36.543 --> 14:37.976
            Not much.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.278
They kept us there
until almost 2:00 a.m.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.412
That's terrible.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.480
            Treating my daughter

14:42.482 --> 14:43.848
                like she's some
                common criminal.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.251
If whoever did this
to Mamie

14:46.253 --> 14:48.519
        really is someone
    from Real Murders, well--

14:48.521 --> 14:50.421
           I downloaded profiles

14:50.423 --> 14:51.756
         on everyone in the club
         last night

14:51.758 --> 14:53.758
              to try to
              figure this out...

14:53.760 --> 14:56.461
          and it's obviously not
          Sally or John.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.464
        I suppose Gerald
     has to be on the list.

14:59.466 --> 15:00.798
     Aurora, how many times
         have I told you

15:00.800 --> 15:03.401
        this club is not
    a wholesome environment?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.904
    LeMaster found the body,
  so that puts him on the list,

15:05.906 --> 15:07.939
        but I'm guessing
        he'll be ruled out soon.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.641
      And so will Bankston.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.009
    Did you hear what I said?

15:11.011 --> 15:14.012
It's not healthy to obsess
on these tragedies, Aurora.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.613
            I overheard Lynn say

15:15.615 --> 15:17.715
     that Mamie was on the phone
     at 6:10 with her sister,

15:17.717 --> 15:19.250
   and LeMaster found the body

15:19.252 --> 15:20.551
                        at 6:30,

15:20.553 --> 15:22.954
              so that pinpoints
              the time of death.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.356
        And then we saw Bankston
        leaving to his car

15:25.358 --> 15:27.325
              to pick up Melanie
              just before 6:30,

15:27.327 --> 15:28.426
        so it definitely
          can't be him,

15:28.428 --> 15:31.496
                     or Melanie.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.731
              Now, Dory, I can't
              imagine it's her,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.900
               she's such a mom.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.068
               Oh.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.803
         Now, Perry Dell
    that's a different story.

15:38.805 --> 15:42.006
          He was really
      agitated last night,

15:42.008 --> 15:43.808
     and he's been arrested
          for fighting.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.510
          He said he turned over
          a new leaf,

15:45.512 --> 15:46.611
               but I don't know.

15:46.613 --> 15:47.812
Here. Chamomile.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.314
     -It'll calm you down--
           -Benjamin!

15:49.316 --> 15:51.482
   I totally forgot about him.

15:51.484 --> 15:52.684
        You know Benjamin Greer,

15:52.686 --> 15:53.918
             the butcher from
             the gourmet market?

15:53.920 --> 15:55.653
          He was the only member

15:55.655 --> 15:57.689
      that didn't show
      to the meeting last night.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.358
             Oh, he's definitely
             on the list.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.793
        And then there's
         Robin Daniels.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.727
         The new tenant?

16:04.396 --> 16:06.130
            He writes
    murder mysteries, Mother.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.900
          And he just happens to
          show up at our meeting

16:08.902 --> 16:10.568
         right after
         what happened to Mamie?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.804
 You think that's a coincidence?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.007
    I'm supposed to give him
  his keys this morning, right?

16:16.009 --> 16:16.941
         I could ask him
        a few questions--

16:16.943 --> 16:18.643
Oh, no, you don't.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.044
   You're not going to inflict
 that suspicious nature of yours

16:20.046 --> 16:22.447
   on a tenant who hasn't even
          moved in yet.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.481
           No, no, no,
     I'll give him the keys.

16:24.616 --> 16:25.616
       Yeah, but what if--

16:25.618 --> 16:26.684
     Listen to your mother.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.034
          Oh, hey, Roe,

16:43.036 --> 16:44.635
          how ya doin'?

16:44.637 --> 16:47.071
       Not good, Benjamin.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.006
        Mamie was killed.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.810
       Yeah, no, the cops
   came by my place yesterday

16:52.812 --> 16:54.045
      to tell me about it,

16:54.047 --> 16:55.613
          asked me why
    I wasn't at the meeting.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.850
      Yeah, I was wondering
         the same thing.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.118
               Well, I got
               some stuff to do.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.919
       You know I'm going
       into politics now.

17:01.921 --> 17:04.521
  I'm the new campaign manager
     for Morrison Pettigrue.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.424
                    He's running
                    for mayor.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.492
        I think he's got
       a real shot to win.

17:08.727 --> 17:10.127
          You think so?

17:10.130 --> 17:11.462
                 Yeah,
                 and if he does,

17:11.464 --> 17:14.499
           that means
  no more bloody aprons for me.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.467
         But right now,

17:16.469 --> 17:17.535
           I've gotta
           get some chicken out.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.569
       Free range organic,

17:19.571 --> 17:20.570
           on special,

17:20.573 --> 17:22.839
       only 6.99 a pound.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.478
           You're thinking
           it's him, aren't you?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.213
          You're thinking
          Benjamin Greer did it.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.681
              I know you're not
              here for chickens.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.884
You don't know
why I'm here.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.719
     Well, I know you're not
         pushing a cart,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.187
            and I know you think

17:36.189 --> 17:37.455
     you need to solve any crime
     within a 50-mile radius.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.057
This wasn't just
any crime.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.858
It involved Mamie,
our friend.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.859
               Yes, we knew her.

17:41.861 --> 17:42.860
And we might even
know who did it

17:42.862 --> 17:44.395
  if it's someone in the club.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.499
                So you do think
                Benjamin did it.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.835
I just think it's strange

17:50.837 --> 17:52.070
that he's the only one

17:52.072 --> 17:53.738
that didn't show up
to the meeting last night,

17:53.740 --> 17:56.207
yet he's not even curious
about how Mamie died,

17:56.209 --> 17:58.042
or anything that happened
the other night.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.744
Was it was
the butcher,

17:59.746 --> 18:01.079
         in the parlor,
      with the candlestick?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.480
             Sorry.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.082
           Hi, Robin.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.817
               Hi.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.718
   Did you two come together?

18:07.720 --> 18:08.986
            Yes. He was
            complaining to Macon

18:08.988 --> 18:09.987
         about not having
         anything in his fridge,

18:09.989 --> 18:11.055
          so I said I'd show him

18:11.057 --> 18:12.590
          where all
          the gourmet stuff was.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.159
: She didn't think
   I'd take her up on it, but...

18:15.161 --> 18:16.260
               Oh, I don't mind,
               really.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.197
           But I do have to
           get back to my story,

18:19.199 --> 18:21.299
             so Roe can show you
             where to find

18:21.301 --> 18:22.533
                  whatever it is
                  that you need.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.936
            If she can stop
            looking for suspects

18:24.938 --> 18:26.104
                for two minutes.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.538
           And if you figure out
           who's guilty,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.040
              this time, can you
              call the police

18:29.042 --> 18:31.409
 before your life is in danger?

18:33.212 --> 18:34.812
Have fun, kids!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.747
              Bye.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.917
      So, do you need help
         with anything?

18:39.919 --> 18:40.918
                             No,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.286
     but I am curious about

18:42.288 --> 18:44.655
   how you plan to investigate
         these suspects.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.193
So this Greer guy
is on your list,

18:49.195 --> 18:51.529
but the husband's gotta
be on there, too, right?

18:51.531 --> 18:53.498
Especially if this is a copy
of the Wallace murder.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.833
        No. Gerald adored Mamie.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.768
          Besides, I don't think
          he'd copy a crime

18:57.770 --> 18:59.203
         that pointed to himself
         as the culprit.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.038
But, see, if this were
a plot in one of my novels,

19:01.040 --> 19:02.273
I'd have him copy it

19:02.275 --> 19:03.908
because no one would think
he'd point to himself.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.476
          Oh, that's diabolical.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.611
            Which is not Gerald.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.745
What about Mr. Sunshine?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.147
The guy who had to
have his lawyer present.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.883
   Oh, if you're talking
   about Perry Dell, I believe--

19:11.885 --> 19:13.050
         Yeah.

19:13.052 --> 19:16.120
        You know, I think
     this is club business.

19:16.122 --> 19:19.724
        So, if you don't
   need me for anything, I'm--

19:19.726 --> 19:21.526
      I'm starting to think
    that I'm a suspect, too,

19:21.528 --> 19:23.794
given the way the police
were treating me last night.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.696
   How do you feel about that?

19:25.698 --> 19:26.931
Are you kidding me?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.866
    It was the greatest night
       I've had in months.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.934
      The only problem is,

19:29.936 --> 19:30.968
          I have no one
       to confirm my alibi

19:30.970 --> 19:32.670
between 6:00
and 6:30, so...

19:36.041 --> 19:37.141
             Okay...

19:37.143 --> 19:38.876
        I know you're not

19:38.878 --> 19:39.977
                 the most
                 likely suspect.

19:39.979 --> 19:40.811
                 You did
                 just move here.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.681
       I thought you came
      for gourmet goodies.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.053
    Have you ever tried this
       with peanut butter?

19:49.055 --> 19:51.088
    It will change your life.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.059
This is very scientific.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.727
You stick it in a bowl,

19:56.729 --> 19:59.764
      you swirl it around,
  the swirl is very important.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.732
        The cereal sticks
      to the peanut butter,

20:01.734 --> 20:03.668
           and voila.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.003
      Sweet crunchy heaven.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.939
                             Mm.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.147
              Oh...

20:16.149 --> 20:18.082
        this is so wrong,

20:18.084 --> 20:19.283
       but it is so good.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.885
    All the best things are.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.019
               Mm.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.788
        So, I'm curious,

20:23.790 --> 20:26.090
       when did you first
       get into mysteries?

20:26.092 --> 20:27.358
               Mm.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.227
         When I was 12.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.761
         My parents were
       getting a divorce,

20:30.763 --> 20:32.863
      and I found this book
         at the library

20:32.865 --> 20:33.965
   about the Hall Mills case.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.866
        The choir singer
        and the minister?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.902
Yeah, it was
such a puzzle.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.070
  There were so many odd clues
           and pieces,

20:39.072 --> 20:40.304
      it was so absorbing.

20:40.306 --> 20:43.040
And it gave me something
to focus on,

20:43.042 --> 20:44.675
         just something
      that felt important,

20:44.677 --> 20:46.143
   with life and death stakes.

20:47.679 --> 20:48.980
How about you?

20:48.982 --> 20:51.816
        I was a teenager.

20:51.818 --> 20:54.051
 My brother had gone off to war,

20:54.053 --> 20:56.887
     and when he came back,
     he was a different guy.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.924
       I needed something
         to escape into,

20:59.926 --> 21:03.027
  and that's when I discovered
        "In Cold Blood."

21:03.029 --> 21:05.830
                  Truman Capote.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.832
     "The village of Holcomb

21:07.834 --> 21:10.835
"stands on the high wheat plains
of western Kansas,

21:10.837 --> 21:12.203
       a lonesome area..."

21:12.205 --> 21:13.304
"...That others call

21:13.306 --> 21:15.273
          'out there.'"

21:15.275 --> 21:17.008
                 See, nothing
                 is too terrible

21:17.010 --> 21:19.243
   if it can be wrestled into
      a pleasing sentence.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.345
 Well, you write a lot of those.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.947
Thanks.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.915
   So, why doesn't my favorite
      writer have an alibi?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.287
       Look, if you really
          want to know,

21:29.289 --> 21:30.921
             and you're not busy
             Friday night--

21:32.158 --> 21:33.324
                         Aurora?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.925
              I got your message
              about the package.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.093
                  Oh...

21:36.095 --> 21:37.762
               You have company.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.763
     Hi.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.465
                  Well, I'm glad

21:41.467 --> 21:42.667
         the two of you
         are getting acquainted.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.770
Oh, but shame
on you, Robin,

21:45.772 --> 21:47.071
       for not telling me
  you're this big famous writer

21:47.073 --> 21:48.973
            when you came to see
            my little townhouse.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.741
                     Believe me,

21:50.743 --> 21:52.777
              fame is in the eye
              of the beholder.

21:52.779 --> 21:53.978
          Here, Mother.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.213
   It was left on my doorstep
        when I got home.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.848
   I know you're busy, though.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.283
      This is your father's
         return address.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.786
Why would he be
sending it here?

22:01.788 --> 22:03.087
          I don't know,

22:03.089 --> 22:05.089
   but you can figure that out
       when you go home...

22:05.091 --> 22:06.590
   But you're opening it here.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.165
Seashell candy.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.933
              Aw...

22:15.935 --> 22:18.302
Remember when you're Aunt Neela
used to send us a box

22:18.304 --> 22:19.303
every Christmas?

22:19.305 --> 22:20.805
I always loved it,

22:20.807 --> 22:23.341
     because it reminded me
    of our time at the beach.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.376
   How thoughtful of your dad
        to remember this.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.478
      That's not like Dad,

22:27.480 --> 22:28.713
     and it's not Christmas.

22:28.715 --> 22:29.880
          "I hope you and Aurora

22:29.882 --> 22:31.282
    enjoy these chocolates."

22:31.284 --> 22:33.250
Well, I know I will.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.919
                 I hope this one
                 is a caramel.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.220
          Mother, stop!

22:36.222 --> 22:39.223
        It's not your job
 to police my calories, Aurora.

22:39.225 --> 22:42.360
        No, I don't think
   these candies are from Dad.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.928
    He never calls me Aurora.

22:43.930 --> 22:44.795
             Never.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.735
I think these chocolates
have been tampered with.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.103
              Look.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.871
         There's a hole
      right at the bottom.

22:53.873 --> 22:54.872
                     Let me see.

22:57.409 --> 22:59.677
          These candies
       have been poisoned.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.324
      I just talked to Dad.

23:13.326 --> 23:14.425
         He didn't send
         those candies.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.960
Of course he didn't
send us poisoned candies.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.194
I mean, as if what happened
with Mamie Wright

23:17.196 --> 23:18.729
wasn't bad enough,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.197
but now this attempt
on my life,

23:20.199 --> 23:21.899
     on my daughter's life?

23:21.901 --> 23:22.967
          Club members
  are obviously being targeted,

23:22.969 --> 23:24.201
       and their families.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.137
       What is she doing?

23:26.139 --> 23:29.006
   Uh, she's looking for books
     on death by chocolate.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.709
    First, we don't even know
 if this chocolate was poisoned.

23:31.711 --> 23:32.943
Yeah, we kinda do.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.311
I mean, smell them,
they're noxious.

23:34.313 --> 23:35.479
It's got to be poison.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.314
Maybe we should let
the labs determine that.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.315
You know,

23:38.317 --> 23:39.784
            I find your attitude
            very cavalier.

23:39.786 --> 23:42.286
     We could be lying dead
     on the floor right now.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.288
                 I'm sorry,
                 Mrs. Teagarden.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.390
            I guess my lack
            of sleep is showing.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.025
      My baby is teething,

23:48.027 --> 23:49.727
I have statements to go through,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.095
   and 10 alibis to pin down,

23:51.097 --> 23:52.463
        including yours.

23:52.465 --> 23:53.764
            Plus, I had to leave
            a media briefing

23:53.766 --> 23:55.099
                   to come here.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.967
           Wait, what?
        A media briefing?

23:56.969 --> 23:58.035
     Is there something new
         about the case?

23:58.037 --> 24:00.237
   Do you have a press badge?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.238
      No, I don't think so.

24:03.542 --> 24:04.975
                 Mrs. Teagarden,
                 I promise you,

24:04.977 --> 24:05.910
              if the labs
              come back positive

24:05.912 --> 24:07.077
          for a toxic substance,

24:07.079 --> 24:09.280
         I will be doing
      a full investigation.

24:14.085 --> 24:16.854
Roe, just in case,

24:16.856 --> 24:19.457
        you should warn the rest
        of your club members

24:19.459 --> 24:22.927
to stay alert.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.965
                 There's so much
                 to go through.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.266
                           Uh...

24:29.268 --> 24:30.768
                   I'll give you
                   a hand.

24:30.770 --> 24:33.037
Uh... okay.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.139
 I knew that this club of yours
      was bad for the soul,

24:35.141 --> 24:37.041
but now it's
worse than that.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.209
                 You can start
                 with these two.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.478
        That club has put
  your life in danger, Aurora.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.047
And it put
your life in danger, too,

24:43.049 --> 24:44.482
   which is making me furious.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.283
      I need to figure out
     who is going after us.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.018
          No! You need to resign
          from that club

24:48.020 --> 24:49.820
        and stay with me
  until this nightmare is over.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.956
        Mother, I am not
     walking away from this.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.958
                   You know, uh,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.159
              I'm right
              across the street.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.161
    I can keep an eye on her
    if it makes you feel better.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.395
           Thank you,

24:58.397 --> 24:59.530
         but my daughter
   is obviously not interested

24:59.532 --> 25:01.265
        in doing anything
   that makes me feel better.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.067
I'm wasting my breath.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.240
  In the "none of my business"
           department,

25:09.242 --> 25:11.575
                   shouldn't you
                   go after her?

25:11.577 --> 25:14.478
I'd just be
wasting my breath.

25:14.480 --> 25:15.813
                       Right.

25:18.984 --> 25:23.921
       What if she'd eaten
        those chocolates?

25:23.923 --> 25:26.590
But she didn't
because you stopped it,

25:26.592 --> 25:29.393
      because you're smart,
        and sharp, and...

25:29.395 --> 25:33.330
       And too emotional.

25:34.934 --> 25:38.402
         Teagarden women
      don't get emotional.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.038
         We get to work.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.239
Right.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.507
        We problem-solve.

25:43.509 --> 25:44.575
Roe?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.710
                  Yeah, in here!

25:47.946 --> 25:48.946
             Oh, hi.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.047
   Hi.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.649
    The police dropped a bomb
        at the briefing.

25:51.651 --> 25:52.917
           They found
     one of Mamie's earrings

25:52.919 --> 25:55.719
     in Melanie Clark's car.

25:59.424 --> 26:00.824
             Where is she going?

26:02.027 --> 26:03.594
            Roe, what are you...

26:03.596 --> 26:06.430
Did you know Mamie's body
was missing an earring?

26:06.432 --> 26:07.598
        No, they hadn't released
        that information

26:07.600 --> 26:09.733
                 until just now.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.571
                       Bankston!

26:13.573 --> 26:14.905
                     Bankston...

26:14.907 --> 26:16.507
    Did you know the police--

26:16.509 --> 26:17.474
Yeah,
I just heard.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.143
I'm headed to the station now.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.344
Do you have a comment
for the paper?

26:20.346 --> 26:22.947
   Sally, now is not the time
        to be a reporter.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.048
  Since when are you
  the boss of me?

26:24.050 --> 26:25.049
Know what,
I do have a comment--

26:25.051 --> 26:27.217
 It's absurd to suspect Melanie.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.186
       Okay? She left work
        just before 6:00.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.321
There's no way
she could kill Mamie

26:30.323 --> 26:31.355
and then
be home in time

26:31.357 --> 26:32.356
 for me to pick her up at 6:30.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.357
        It's impossible.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.658
                Whoever did this

26:34.660 --> 26:35.559
           is trying to set up
           a member of your club

26:35.561 --> 26:36.560
              to take the blame.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.095
  Yeah, I think that's obvious.

26:39.364 --> 26:40.264
I gotta go.

26:47.405 --> 26:48.806
               This is not good.

26:48.808 --> 26:51.008
       You don't even know about
       the poisoned candy yet.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.176
Poisoned candy?

26:52.178 --> 26:54.044
           Okay, we need to call
           a club meeting.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.316
        She was crumpled
        like a rag doll,

26:59.318 --> 27:01.285
        there in front of
         the fireplace.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.954
           I went over
        to get the keys,

27:03.956 --> 27:06.690
and then the door was open...

27:06.692 --> 27:08.125
         Does Lynn know
         we're meeting?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.226
               Yeah, I told her,

27:09.228 --> 27:10.260
                and I'll
                have to tell her

27:10.262 --> 27:11.228
               everything
               that's said here.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.363
              Good.

27:13.498 --> 27:14.632
Why'd you
bring the writer?

27:14.634 --> 27:16.767
Seems to me
he's a likely suspect.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.069
          Which is why
      he's a part of this.

27:22.407 --> 27:25.943
        Thank you all for coming
        on such short notice.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.619
                     First, I...

27:35.621 --> 27:37.421
   I just want Gerald to know
        how sorry we are

27:37.423 --> 27:38.656
                  for your loss.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.958
    Mamie was a good person.

28:00.979 --> 28:01.912
                I didn't do
                anything to her.

28:03.314 --> 28:04.314
I don't know
how that earring

28:04.316 --> 28:05.783
got in my car.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.251
         Because someone
        planted it there,

28:07.253 --> 28:08.652
that's why.

28:08.654 --> 28:09.820
                   Look, anybody
                   who knows you

28:09.822 --> 28:10.754
           knows how ridiculous
           it is to think that--

28:10.756 --> 28:13.424
This is uncomfortable
for all of us.

28:15.260 --> 28:19.196
What happened to Mamie
was horrible,

28:19.198 --> 28:21.065
and it's hard to imagine it
happening again,

28:21.067 --> 28:22.266
          but it could.

28:22.268 --> 28:25.102
A package was mailed
to Roe's house.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.237
It was a box of candy

28:27.239 --> 28:28.272
that she thinks
was poisoned.

28:28.274 --> 28:29.273
     If our lab confirms it,

28:29.275 --> 28:30.641
          then we have to assume

28:30.643 --> 28:33.510
          that all of you here
          are potential targets.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.146
  And that we're all suspects.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.147
     Why would you say that?

28:37.149 --> 28:38.182
   Why should it be one of us?

28:38.184 --> 28:39.450
: Well,
whoever killed Mamie

28:39.452 --> 28:40.484
did so in a way

28:40.486 --> 28:41.585
that replicated
the Wallace case.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.053
: Right, I mean,
who else would know

28:43.055 --> 28:45.522
   that we were talking about
    that case on that night?

28:45.524 --> 28:47.758
     Or be familiar with it?

28:47.760 --> 28:50.127
  But no one knows for certain
  how Julia Wallace was killed.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.295
Nonsense.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.063
      -She was bludgeoned.
           -With what?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.498
   The weapon was never found.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.566
                Well, every
                author I've read

28:55.568 --> 28:56.467
                 says it was
                 the fire poker.

28:56.469 --> 28:57.668
Well, actually,

28:57.670 --> 28:59.603
          Scotland Yard
     has a different theory.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.538
 Come on, the poker was missing
       from Mamie's house.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.807
                    It had to be
                    the poker.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.776
I don't know why you people
always dismiss my opinions?

29:05.778 --> 29:07.277
                           Okay,

29:07.279 --> 29:08.812
    we're getting off track.

29:08.814 --> 29:10.614
          We're also considering
          the possibility

29:10.616 --> 29:13.083
that the guilty party is someone
  connected to a group member.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.351
                          Right,

29:14.353 --> 29:16.420
     maybe someone that has
      access to our emails,

29:16.422 --> 29:19.156
          maybe someone
      one of you talked to?

29:19.158 --> 29:21.258
         Did anyone here
    discuss the Wallace case

29:21.260 --> 29:22.693
         with a friend,
        a family member?

29:22.695 --> 29:24.228
Or an enemy?

29:24.230 --> 29:25.462
                  Wait a minute,

29:25.464 --> 29:27.264
is everything we're saying going
          in the paper?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.666
               Because if it is,
               I need to leave.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.269
        These stories could
        hurt my business, Sally.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.338
  But this is the biggest story
         I've ever had.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.106
He's right.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.075
This needs to be off the record.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.212
     Okay, we need to figure out
      who could be doing this,

29:42.214 --> 29:43.547
      because if we don't,

29:43.549 --> 29:45.983
  I'm afraid that someone else
       might be targeted.

29:56.161 --> 29:57.327
        What are you all
       looking at me for?

29:57.329 --> 29:58.729
      I didn't do anything.

30:00.098 --> 30:01.732
I hate to say it,

30:01.734 --> 30:04.234
        but if this club
        is putting us in danger,

30:04.236 --> 30:06.603
           maybe we should think
           about disbanding it.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.605
Well, I don't care,

30:08.607 --> 30:09.673
      I'm quitting anyway,

30:09.675 --> 30:12.509
   I have better things to do.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.745
            So don't anyone
            come try to kill me,

30:14.747 --> 30:16.046
 'cause I'll be waiting for you.

30:32.564 --> 30:33.997
                       Gerald...

30:36.401 --> 30:40.470
   I have to trust the police
    to find the right person.

30:57.488 --> 30:58.689
After what Melanie
has been put through,

30:58.691 --> 31:01.692
I'm not sure how much faith
I have in the police.

31:01.694 --> 31:05.429
I think we've had enough
for one day, though.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.802
          Well, I guess

31:11.804 --> 31:14.338
      the Real Murders Club
          is adjourned.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.947
                  Did you see
                  Gerald's face?

31:23.949 --> 31:25.382
           I have to solve this.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.484
No, Roe,

31:27.486 --> 31:29.519
you have to let
the police handle this.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.489
Whoever did this to Mamie
is seriously twisted.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.492
I have to go.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.561
          -Bye, Robin.
              -Bye.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.729
That's the last of them.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.163
                Great.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.798
       Thanks for helping.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.334
  I haven't done anything yet.

31:45.603 --> 31:48.071
               You know,
               I figured it out,

31:48.073 --> 31:50.474
         You're like the heroine
         in one of my novels.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.010
       Smart, determined,

31:53.012 --> 31:54.578
            gorgeous.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.581
  If you think flirting with me
    is going to distract me,

31:57.583 --> 31:58.448
          you're wrong.

31:59.784 --> 32:01.618
 What am I distracting you from?

32:01.620 --> 32:03.720
 From wondering why you're here.

32:03.722 --> 32:05.188
 You, the man without an alibi.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.393
      You're really hung up
   on this whole alibi thing.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.161
    And you keep avoiding it.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.830
    Maybe you're here because
  you're keeping an eye on us,

32:13.832 --> 32:15.966
     so we don't figure out
      the truth about you.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.901
          The truth is,

32:17.903 --> 32:19.670
 is that I write mystery novels
          for a living,

32:19.672 --> 32:21.438
                  but I never
                  get to see one

32:21.440 --> 32:23.740
    carried out in real life.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.944
    Why don't I believe you?

32:28.546 --> 32:29.846
        Okay, you got me.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.148
        I'm actually here

32:31.150 --> 32:34.785
        because I really,
        really like you.

32:34.787 --> 32:35.919
    Now, I'll let you decide

32:35.921 --> 32:37.821
     whether that was meant
        to distract you,

32:37.823 --> 32:39.756
      or if it just happens
           to be true.

32:44.128 --> 32:47.898
       What if it's both?

32:50.902 --> 32:53.170
  Sally, I need to talk to you.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.839
     Oh, I knew you'd be mad
  as soon as you saw the paper.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.507
       <i> No, this is about</i>
         <i> Robin Daniels.</i>

32:57.509 --> 32:58.675
       Yesterday he said--

32:58.677 --> 33:00.310
       Wait, what would I
          be mad about?

33:00.312 --> 33:01.745
           <i> You know,</i>
    <i> I was just doing my job.</i>

33:01.747 --> 33:03.780
 The public has a right to know
    exactly what's going on.

33:17.595 --> 33:18.762
I see

33:18.764 --> 33:21.598
you're making a spectacle
of yourself again.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.800
     The reporter quoted me
     without my permission.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.103
    Hmm. "By Sally Allison."

33:26.105 --> 33:27.504
Bud Allison's
daughter?

33:27.506 --> 33:28.905
Isn't she your friend?

33:28.907 --> 33:30.774
Some "friend."

33:44.022 --> 33:45.589
Hey, Mr. Allison.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.624
            Hey, Roe.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.026
             Oh, let me help you
             with that door.

33:49.028 --> 33:50.427
Oh, thanks.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.231
                           Geez.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.632
That door
is getting worse.

33:55.634 --> 33:56.933
                         I know.

33:56.935 --> 33:59.202
       I almost got myself
   locked in there last week.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.071
       Yeah, I'm surprised
     to see you here today.

34:01.073 --> 34:02.906
        Don't you usually
    volunteer on Wednesdays?

34:02.908 --> 34:04.074
           Yeah, well,

34:04.076 --> 34:05.175
     what with Sally's story
          in the paper

34:05.177 --> 34:06.610
                   this morning,

34:06.612 --> 34:07.577
           the phone's been
           ringing off the hook.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.179
    I had to get some peace.

34:09.181 --> 34:12.248
                I see you've had
                a peek at it.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.617
Oh, yeah, I've read it.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.485
              Yeah.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.827
     I mean, why shouldn't I
     go out with him, right?

34:23.829 --> 34:24.995
       So I told Deborah,

34:24.996 --> 34:26.696
        you get that man
     over to my house pronto

34:26.697 --> 34:28.732
   before he changes his mind!

34:29.701 --> 34:30.734
                        Allison!

34:30.735 --> 34:31.701
   Yeah?

34:31.703 --> 34:32.803
        Quit socializing.

34:32.804 --> 34:33.937
          Grab Paul,
          get yourself downtown.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.206
   Something big is going on.
        Fourth and Pine.

34:50.353 --> 34:51.922
        <i> Hi, it's Sally.</i>

34:51.924 --> 34:54.024
<i> Leave a message.</i>

34:54.025 --> 34:55.625
 Hmm, so you're not picking up.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.294
       Well, call me back.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.929
         I need to know
       if I'm your friend

34:58.931 --> 35:00.030
         or your source.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.232
                    Lynn.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.268
      You must not be happy
  about the story in the paper.

35:05.270 --> 35:07.437
        Haven't seen it,
       don't wanna see it.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.339
     I'm here because we got
   the labs back on the candy.

35:09.341 --> 35:12.209
There were no
fingerprints on the box

35:12.211 --> 35:13.343
other than you
and your mother's,

35:13.345 --> 35:15.378
         but we did get
     a positive for poison.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.149
Rat poison to be exact.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.917
         You were right.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.886
   Someone was out to harm you
        and your mother.

35:23.988 --> 35:25.322
        You mean kill us,

35:25.324 --> 35:27.657
        and they could be
 going after other club members.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.360
Aurora!

35:30.362 --> 35:32.629
         Using your inside voice
         at the library

35:32.631 --> 35:33.697
                might set
                a better example

35:33.699 --> 35:34.764
for your friend.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.666
Oh, we're not friends.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.268
Well, good for you.

35:41.339 --> 35:43.140
    Anyway, I've spoken with
       my patrol sergeant,

35:43.142 --> 35:44.741
and he's agreed
to have his cars

35:44.743 --> 35:46.176
          do swings by
      your members' houses,

35:46.178 --> 35:47.544
    just to keep an eye out.

35:48.813 --> 35:49.913
           That's it?

35:51.283 --> 35:52.682
    Would you let your mother
        know the results?

35:52.684 --> 35:53.917
      I have to take this.

35:53.919 --> 35:54.818
        Liggett-Smith...

35:57.088 --> 35:59.856
What?

35:59.858 --> 36:00.757
I'm on my way.

36:07.398 --> 36:08.698
So, it was rat poison
in the candy,

36:08.700 --> 36:10.267
wasn't it?

36:10.269 --> 36:11.234
                 How'd you know?

36:11.236 --> 36:12.903
I've become
all too familiar

36:12.905 --> 36:14.371
with gruesome things--

36:14.373 --> 36:15.772
for which I blame you.

36:15.774 --> 36:16.840
Show her.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.341
      This is out of print.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.442
         I only have it

36:19.444 --> 36:22.312
    because there's a chapter
        on Lizzie Borden.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.849
  Ever hear of Cordelia Botkin?

36:25.851 --> 36:27.884
    Sounds vaguely familiar.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.219
1878.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.488
    She was having an affair,
     a wealthy businessman.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.290
  He refused to leave his wife,

36:33.292 --> 36:35.125
   so Cordelia mailed the wife

36:35.127 --> 36:37.093
a box of bonbons.

36:37.095 --> 36:38.228
     Filled with rat poison.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.863
         Now I remember.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.431
   It's such an obscure case,
 I'd almost forgotten about it.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.866
         The wife died.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.134
                     And so did
                     her mother.

36:44.136 --> 36:46.336
    That's why the chocolates
     were addressed to you.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.039
      Okay, we have to let
      the club members know

36:49.041 --> 36:51.174
       about the results.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.409
           Excuse me.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.944
           Robin, hi.

36:53.946 --> 36:55.745
         Uh, now is not
       a really good time.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.747
   <i> Are you watching the news?</i>

36:57.749 --> 36:58.815
           What news?

37:00.084 --> 37:01.418
     <i> ...Morrison Pettigrue</i>

37:01.420 --> 37:04.254
     <i> had recently announced</i>
    <i> his candidacy for mayor,</i>

37:04.256 --> 37:06.156
   <i> and police have, in fact,</i>
 <i> ruled his death a homicide...</i>

37:08.226 --> 37:09.759
Could it be
the same person?

37:09.761 --> 37:12.195
Could he be targeting people
outside of the club now?

37:12.197 --> 37:13.330
                   Look, there's
                   Benjamin.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.598
          <i> ...The body</i>
    <i> was, in fact, discovered</i>

37:14.600 --> 37:17.067
<i>by Pettigrue's campaign manager,</i>
        <i> Benjamin Greer.</i>

37:17.069 --> 37:18.535
       <i> Greer told police</i>

37:18.537 --> 37:21.571
    <i> that he found Pettigrue</i>
<i>inside a bathtub full of water,</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:24.074
      <i> apparent stab wounds</i>
          <i> in his chest</i>

37:24.076 --> 37:26.409
     <i> and a number of papers</i>
     <i> floating in the water.</i>

37:26.411 --> 37:28.078
<i>We will continue to bring you--</i>

37:28.080 --> 37:30.013
                  I can't listen
                  to any more.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.348
Papers floating on the water,

37:31.350 --> 37:32.349
             why does that sound

37:32.351 --> 37:34.351
          so familiar?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.086
    The Marat Assassination!

37:36.088 --> 37:37.053
The what?

37:37.055 --> 37:38.188
        A famous case in Europe.

37:38.190 --> 37:39.823
Oh, the one
from the painting!

37:39.825 --> 37:41.258
     The French Revolution,
        Jean-Paul Marat.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.225
      He was a politician--

37:42.227 --> 37:43.927
    Like Morrison Pettigrue.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.795
      Killed in the bathtub
    by an assassin. Stabbed--

37:45.797 --> 37:47.097
Like
Morrison Pettigrue.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.031
     John, we have got to go
      to the police station

37:48.033 --> 37:49.065
         and tell Lynn.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.936
We should stop
at my house,

37:52.938 --> 37:54.337
I have a book
on assassinations,

37:54.339 --> 37:55.905
so Lynn can see
what we're talking about.

37:55.907 --> 37:59.276
    It's the 21st Century, John,
    we can look it up online.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.418
         What do you want to bet

38:08.420 --> 38:11.521
          that's the knife
          that killed Pettigrue?

38:23.434 --> 38:26.002
     Sorry, guys. Lynn keeps
  texting me questions to ask.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.237
            It's not a good week

38:27.239 --> 38:28.171
          for her to be the only
          homicide detective

38:28.173 --> 38:29.172
         in Lawrenceton.

38:29.174 --> 38:30.273
          Two murders.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.242
And one attempted,
me and my mother.

38:32.244 --> 38:34.110
          Yeah, so, uh,
     you go out to your car.

38:34.112 --> 38:35.545
   Was it locked or unlocked?

38:35.547 --> 38:37.514
            Not sure,
     but I tend to lock it.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.017
          I didn't have
       anything to do with

38:41.019 --> 38:43.153
        what happened to
        that politician.

38:43.155 --> 38:45.655
         I was with Aida
     until 10:00 last night.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.557
 The coroner is placing the time
   of death at about midnight.

38:47.559 --> 38:51.328
Which means
John has no alibi.

38:53.230 --> 38:54.431
        I'm not offended
        to be suspected,

38:54.433 --> 38:55.632
      but I'm very offended

38:55.634 --> 38:56.800
     to be thought of doing
         such a poor job

38:56.802 --> 38:59.369
     as to leave the weapon
         in my own car.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.470
                   Okay, listen,

39:00.472 --> 39:01.905
          I'm sure that
     the knife was planted.

39:01.907 --> 39:02.739
   But I still have to ask you
  to come down to the station,

39:02.741 --> 39:04.107
     and get fingerprinted.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.108
       Roe, we've already
       got yours on file.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.343
         Why do you need
           her prints?

39:06.345 --> 39:08.678
Because they need
to make sure

39:08.680 --> 39:10.647
I'm not the one
who planted it.

39:16.554 --> 39:17.587
You know John.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.356
He would never
hurt anyone.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.324
What about Lynn,
or Captain Burns?

39:21.326 --> 39:24.461
     Well, they know someone
   is trying to run us ragged,

39:24.463 --> 39:26.796
         looking in all
        the wrong places.

39:26.798 --> 39:30.266
        A patrolman found
     rat poison in my desk.

39:30.268 --> 39:31.534
Whoever is doing this

39:31.536 --> 39:33.136
wanted to
make it look like

39:33.138 --> 39:34.304
you're trying
to poison me?

39:34.306 --> 39:36.306
 Would have been more believable

39:36.308 --> 39:38.141
    if they found the poison
           in my desk.

39:39.276 --> 39:40.443
You're funny.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.179
         Have you told them yet?

39:47.318 --> 39:48.651
                       See here,

39:48.653 --> 39:51.354
       Marat's papers were found
       floating in the tub.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.089
Same as Pettigrue.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.457
       So the question is,

39:54.459 --> 39:55.759
      was Pettigrue chosen

39:55.761 --> 39:57.327
        because Benjamin
         is in the club,

39:57.329 --> 39:59.229
or because Pettigrue
fit the profile

39:59.231 --> 40:00.563
       of a famous victim?

40:00.565 --> 40:01.865
     If it's the second one,

40:01.867 --> 40:04.401
       then anyone in town
  could be a potential target.

40:04.403 --> 40:05.635
          Well, so far,

40:05.637 --> 40:06.669
     the copycats have been
    related to club members.

40:06.671 --> 40:08.104
And I'm still
trying to figure out

40:08.106 --> 40:09.873
if there's a common thread
between the three.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.041
       Maybe they're from
         the same book.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.576
            Or the same website.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.511
               I mean, it is
               the 21st Century.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.279
I have been trying

40:16.281 --> 40:17.347
    to find a common thread,

40:17.349 --> 40:18.314
           a pattern--

40:18.316 --> 40:19.315
                          Smith!

40:19.317 --> 40:21.251
                   What is this?

40:21.253 --> 40:22.819
          Our suspects
   making themselves at home?

40:22.821 --> 40:25.255
 Actually, they've been sharing
      information with us.

40:25.257 --> 40:26.623
       Sounded to me like
   you were sharing with them.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.192
                 Did I authorize
                 consultants

40:29.194 --> 40:30.326
                   on this case?

40:30.328 --> 40:31.728
      No, sir.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.062
      Then get them out of here.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.535
        I've always loved
     his sunny personality.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.736
Yeah, okay,

40:39.738 --> 40:41.171
let's give
Detective Smith here

40:41.173 --> 40:42.505
some space.

40:48.179 --> 40:49.546
     Lynn, there's something
        I've got to know.

40:49.548 --> 40:52.315
       How high is Robin Daniels
       on your suspect list?

40:52.317 --> 40:53.550
            I am not
   discussing that with you--

40:53.552 --> 40:55.318
     I delivered your baby.

40:56.655 --> 40:58.354
    I knew you were going to
   play that card eventually.

40:59.490 --> 41:00.623
Fine.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.426
He was at the top
of the list for a while.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.395
He had a weak alibi.

41:05.397 --> 41:06.362
     Said he was buying gas
         at some station

41:06.364 --> 41:07.464
       miles out of town,

41:07.466 --> 41:08.598
            a station
   he couldn't even remember.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.800
But we found gas charges
on his card,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.936
and the security cameras
picked him up there.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.704
         Daniels wasn't
      anywhere near Mamie.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.608
             Thanks.

41:23.447 --> 41:24.547
So, this is
my favorite restaurant

41:24.549 --> 41:25.915
and candy store.

41:25.917 --> 41:28.351
           Wow. To what do I owe
           the invitation?

41:28.353 --> 41:30.653
           Besides my obvious
           obsession with sugar.

41:30.655 --> 41:32.755
A peace offering?

41:32.757 --> 41:33.857
Lynn told me today

41:33.859 --> 41:35.825
that you've been
officially cleared.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.427
Well,
                that's a relief.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.262
              Are you surprised?

41:39.264 --> 41:41.231
No, not really.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.900
Look, can we at least agree that
        I'm on your side?

41:43.902 --> 41:46.469
     I'm definitely getting
        that impression.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.470
                           Good.

41:47.472 --> 41:49.439
   So, tell your Marat theory.

41:49.441 --> 41:51.841
      I will, but first...

41:51.843 --> 41:53.276
                Salted caramels?

41:53.278 --> 41:54.244
   Yeah.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.350
               Mm!

42:01.485 --> 42:02.485
                         Uh-huh.

42:02.487 --> 42:03.353
             Mm-hmm?

42:12.830 --> 42:15.498
      Lynn ruled out Robin
          as a suspect.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.667
            You know, I think
            he really likes you.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.769
    That's what he tells me.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.538
           Oh, really?

42:21.540 --> 42:24.440
      And do you like him?

42:26.443 --> 42:28.545
         Now that I know
  he's not a devious criminal?

42:28.547 --> 42:31.748
       Yeah. I think I do.

42:31.750 --> 42:32.882
   We speak the same language.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.684
              Wow.

42:34.686 --> 42:36.486
         A famous author
   to add to your collection.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.456
          Hey, you know
      what I just told you

42:40.458 --> 42:41.624
   about my feelings for Robin

42:41.626 --> 42:42.592
       are private, right?

42:44.328 --> 42:45.595
       Roe, how could you
         even say that?

42:45.597 --> 42:49.165
         Um, because of
       your latest story?

42:50.401 --> 42:51.935
            Oh, that.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.337
                     Yeah, that.

42:54.339 --> 42:55.605
         You quoted club members

42:55.607 --> 42:57.907
        even though we asked you
        at the meeting

42:57.909 --> 42:58.942
                 to keep it
                 off the record.

42:58.944 --> 43:00.977
Look, I know,
and I'm sorry.

43:00.979 --> 43:04.013
      The Associated Press
 is picking up my articles now.

43:04.015 --> 43:05.882
    So that means you have to
    sensationalize the club?

43:05.884 --> 43:07.250
                   And quote me,
                   quote Gerald?

43:07.252 --> 43:08.751
     That's not what I was--

43:08.753 --> 43:09.953
You always talk about respecting
           the victims

43:09.955 --> 43:11.287
      and their families--

43:11.289 --> 43:13.056
         And you always
    turn them into suspects.

43:13.058 --> 43:15.024
       I see Gerald's name
on your little list right there.

43:15.026 --> 43:16.459
     He's not even that high
          on the list.

43:16.461 --> 43:18.027
        He's number five,
        right after you.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.363
     What! I'm on your list?

43:21.765 --> 43:23.433
Number four!

43:23.435 --> 43:24.834
     Roe, that's not funny!

43:24.836 --> 43:26.269
             I know,

43:26.271 --> 43:28.404
 but this isn't a suspect list.

43:28.406 --> 43:29.939
         This is a list
      of who might be next.

43:29.941 --> 43:31.374
              Oh...

43:31.376 --> 43:32.475
              What?

43:32.477 --> 43:34.377
        I'm going through
      all these old cases,

43:34.379 --> 43:35.645
        and I'm tracking
        the similarities

43:35.647 --> 43:37.981
       between the victims
      and the club members.

43:37.983 --> 43:40.717
               So, LeMaster
               is a businessman,

43:40.719 --> 43:42.085
        that bumps him up
          on the list.

43:42.087 --> 43:45.421
 John is a real estate investor,
 that bumps him up.

43:45.423 --> 43:46.923
 And I'm number four because...

43:48.459 --> 43:49.759
       Reporters do things

43:49.761 --> 43:51.494
   that get people mad enough
       to get rid of them.

43:53.063 --> 43:54.897
I wonder why.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.434
         I'd better go.

43:58.436 --> 44:00.970
            Hey, if it makes you
            feel any better,

44:00.972 --> 44:03.806
           I'm on the list, too.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.776
     I've found at least one
    librarian victim so far.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.678
       It doesn't make me
        feel any better.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.446
       I couldn't bear it
  if something happened to you.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.548
            You too.

44:12.550 --> 44:15.051
   Hey, maybe you should stay
      with your mom and dad

44:15.053 --> 44:17.053
  until they catch the bad guy.

44:17.055 --> 44:19.822
      Yeah, I think I will.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.392
       Thanks for the tea.

45:18.801 --> 45:20.568
                            Hey.

45:20.570 --> 45:21.636
               Hi.

45:21.638 --> 45:22.771
        I'm supposed to
        start teaching tomorrow.

45:22.773 --> 45:23.905
                   I was looking
                   for my bag.

45:23.907 --> 45:25.240
            but I can't find it.

45:25.242 --> 45:26.908
        I could have sworn
        it was in the back seat.

45:28.077 --> 45:29.811
                You okay?

45:29.813 --> 45:32.914
No, there was someone
in my backyard.

45:32.916 --> 45:35.183
Did you see anyone
running around here?

45:35.185 --> 45:37.886
               No, I was looking
               in my car.

45:37.888 --> 45:38.853
           Hey, guys.

45:38.855 --> 45:40.722
Hey, Bankston.

45:40.724 --> 45:43.158
Hey, did you see anyone
suspicious looking

45:43.160 --> 45:45.093
just hanging
around here?

45:45.095 --> 45:46.695
               No.

45:46.697 --> 45:47.629
         You know what,
     it wouldn't surprise me

45:47.631 --> 45:49.064
  if that creep Perry Dell was.

45:49.066 --> 45:51.266
 That guy's got a police record,
       like, a mile long.

45:51.268 --> 45:52.867
     I bet you he's the one
      doing all this stuff.

45:54.136 --> 45:56.871
            Well, it's never
            the obvious suspect.

45:56.873 --> 45:58.840
      Yeah, well, maybe not
     in your little novels,

45:58.842 --> 46:00.809
     but this is real life.

46:02.345 --> 46:04.045
Wow.

46:04.047 --> 46:05.714
             What's his problem?

46:05.716 --> 46:07.182
I think this situation

46:07.184 --> 46:09.617
is making everybody
a little bit jumpy.

46:09.619 --> 46:10.785
I don't even know
what I'm going to do

46:10.787 --> 46:12.987
from one minute
to the next.

46:12.989 --> 46:15.890
                Hey, listen, um,

46:15.892 --> 46:18.893
       now that my innocence has
       been firmly established,

46:18.895 --> 46:21.363
              you want to go
              to lunch tomorrow?

46:21.365 --> 46:25.667
Yeah. Okay.

46:25.669 --> 46:26.835
                      Great.

46:26.837 --> 46:28.136
                      All right.

46:28.138 --> 46:29.137
                     Good night.

46:29.139 --> 46:30.171
Good night.

46:37.079 --> 46:38.246
           Ma, I can't
       eat all this food.

46:38.248 --> 46:40.014
     You're too thin, honey.

46:40.016 --> 46:40.982
                    Mom's right,
                    cupcake.

46:40.984 --> 46:42.784
            You're wasting away.

46:42.786 --> 46:44.352
Daddy, I don't eat meat.

46:44.354 --> 46:45.787
      Who doesn't eat meat?

46:45.789 --> 46:46.788
         You always ate meat
         when you lived at home.

46:46.790 --> 46:48.723
     That was 15 years ago,

46:48.725 --> 46:50.125
     and you guys both know
        I'm a vegetarian.

46:50.127 --> 46:52.427
               I thought it was
               one of your fads.

46:52.429 --> 46:54.062
  You always did change hobbies
  at the drop of a hat, honey.

46:54.064 --> 46:56.698
      I have to go to work.

46:56.700 --> 46:57.699
                    You have not
                    been excused

46:57.701 --> 46:59.200
            from this table yet,
            young lady.

46:59.202 --> 47:00.969
            Sit down
     and eat your breakfast.

47:00.971 --> 47:02.003
        Come on, eat up.

47:02.005 --> 47:03.271
           We're looking forward

47:03.273 --> 47:05.607
                to meeting you
                for lunch today.

47:09.412 --> 47:12.046
             Lunch?

47:12.048 --> 47:14.182
          We planned it
      last week, remember?

47:14.184 --> 47:16.985
Are you always
this forgetful?

47:16.987 --> 47:19.254
             I don't think
             this vegetarian fad

47:19.256 --> 47:20.822
                 is good
                 for you at all.

47:20.824 --> 47:23.024
      It's not a fad, Mom.

47:23.026 --> 47:24.325
               Bud, help me fold
               Sally's clothes,

47:24.327 --> 47:25.326
                       will you?

47:25.328 --> 47:26.394
     You washed my clothes?

47:26.396 --> 47:27.462
       They weren't dirty.

47:27.464 --> 47:29.898
        They were looking
         a little dingy.

47:29.900 --> 47:31.332
    They were dry clean only.

47:34.137 --> 47:36.271
      You don't want to be
   wasting money dry cleaning.

47:47.883 --> 47:49.984
          I wanted to take home
          some true crime books,

47:49.986 --> 47:51.119
        but most of them
    are already checked out.

47:51.121 --> 47:53.254
      Well, don't complain.

47:53.256 --> 47:55.490
    It was yet another one of
          your friends

47:55.492 --> 47:57.959
who came and checked them out
in a batch a few weeks ago.

47:57.961 --> 47:59.727
                    What friend?

47:59.729 --> 48:01.196
        You should know.

48:01.198 --> 48:02.397
   He told me you were the one

48:02.399 --> 48:04.365
           who got him
   interested in the subject.

48:05.969 --> 48:08.069
Couldn't you just
       answer my question?

48:10.973 --> 48:12.340
           Of course.

48:12.342 --> 48:15.743
           Perry Dell.

48:15.745 --> 48:16.878
Perry Dell
checked out all these

48:16.880 --> 48:18.346
two weeks before
the first murder?

48:18.348 --> 48:20.014
         Yeah, he's been
         in the club for a year,

48:20.016 --> 48:22.317
          and he just now starts
          reading true crime?

48:22.319 --> 48:23.818
See, if this
were a novel,

48:23.820 --> 48:25.920
this would be
a big neon sign

48:25.922 --> 48:27.422
pointing
directly at him.

48:27.424 --> 48:29.257
             Well, the Marat
             and Wallace stories

48:29.259 --> 48:30.358
             are in those books,

48:30.360 --> 48:31.826
                 but not Botkin.

48:31.828 --> 48:32.861
You really think
all those cases

48:32.863 --> 48:34.028
are going to show up
in one book?

48:34.030 --> 48:35.997
       Well, it's one
       possibility of a pattern.

48:35.999 --> 48:37.465
        Another might be
   a common type of attacker,

48:37.467 --> 48:39.000
                   like a woman.

48:39.002 --> 48:40.768
                 With both Marat
                 and Botkin,

48:40.770 --> 48:41.803
         it was a woman.

48:41.805 --> 48:42.904
  But who knows about Wallace?

48:42.906 --> 48:44.439
     But wasn't the husband
           convicted?

48:44.441 --> 48:46.074
    Yeah, but a lot of people
     think he was innocent.

48:46.076 --> 48:47.208
    There are other theories
       in the literature.

48:47.210 --> 48:48.510
               Oh.

48:48.512 --> 48:50.845
    So your area of expertise
     is not just the crime,

48:50.847 --> 48:53.014
        but which sources
      mention which cases?

48:53.016 --> 48:55.984
          I am a menace
     on the message boards.

48:55.986 --> 48:57.819
      You're also amazing.

48:59.355 --> 49:02.056
            You talk
            just like you write.

49:02.058 --> 49:04.025
          It's always clear what
          your characters want.

49:04.027 --> 49:05.927
Well, that's
my expertise.

49:05.929 --> 49:08.329
Character,
motivation, want.

49:08.331 --> 49:12.133
    Now, what do you suppose
     a copycat killer wants?

49:12.135 --> 49:13.968
Besides attention.

49:13.970 --> 49:15.470
       Oh, I have no idea.

49:15.472 --> 49:17.071
            A person
    who takes someone's life

49:17.073 --> 49:18.206
      doesn't seem to want
         normal things.

49:18.208 --> 49:19.841
    Well, sometimes, they do.

49:19.843 --> 49:22.176
  They just have abnormal ways
        of getting them.

49:23.146 --> 49:24.379
       Heya, small world.

49:24.381 --> 49:25.880
Hey, yourself.

49:25.882 --> 49:27.148
Mr. And Mrs. Allison,

49:27.150 --> 49:28.249
     this is Robin Daniels.

49:28.251 --> 49:29.250
             Hello.

49:29.252 --> 49:30.485
    It's so nice to meet you.

49:30.487 --> 49:31.819
                    Hi. You look
                    familiar.

49:31.821 --> 49:33.555
Probably from
his book jackets, Dad.

49:33.557 --> 49:35.056
              Ah...

49:35.058 --> 49:36.391
I made a display
of your books last week.

49:36.393 --> 49:37.592
             Roe just loves you.

49:37.594 --> 49:39.160
          Does she now?

49:39.162 --> 49:40.662
    She didn't mention that.

49:40.664 --> 49:43.131
          Well, welcome
          to Lawrenceton, Robin.

49:43.133 --> 49:44.232
Thank you.

49:44.234 --> 49:45.233
                  And how have
                  you been, Roe?

49:45.235 --> 49:46.868
                      How do you
                      think, Ma?

49:46.870 --> 49:48.236
         She's terrible.

49:48.238 --> 49:49.404
       We're all terrible
with everything that's going on.

49:49.406 --> 49:51.339
      Well then, you should
       fold up that club.

49:51.341 --> 49:53.675
 You sound just like my mother.

49:53.677 --> 49:55.109
             Aida is
       a very wise woman.

49:55.111 --> 49:56.911
Why don't we
grab a seat

49:56.913 --> 49:58.580
and let them
get back to their lunch?

49:58.582 --> 49:59.981
                    Nice to meet
                    you both.

49:59.983 --> 50:00.848
              Yes.

50:01.951 --> 50:03.151
                        One day.

50:03.153 --> 50:04.619
            I've been
   staying with them one day,

50:04.621 --> 50:06.087
  and I'm already going crazy.

50:09.959 --> 50:11.526
They seem
nice enough to me.

50:11.528 --> 50:15.063
    Oh, Sally and her stepmother
    are great friends, really,

50:15.065 --> 50:17.532
      it's been a long time
      since she's lived at home.

50:17.534 --> 50:19.033
Right, of course.

50:19.035 --> 50:21.936
    Okay, you were talking about
    suspects' motivation.

50:21.938 --> 50:24.639
       Yes, so motivation
  always starts with character.

50:24.641 --> 50:29.043
     Okay, so if Perry Dell
        is my character,

50:29.045 --> 50:31.512
    then I need to figure out
         what he wants,

50:31.514 --> 50:33.348
     and why he checked out
          those books.

50:33.350 --> 50:35.516
No, no, no, wait,
you can't do that.

50:35.518 --> 50:37.919
 You can't just go and question
   a possible murder suspect.

50:37.921 --> 50:39.320
          That's crazy.

50:39.322 --> 50:42.523
    Oh, then you have no idea
  what motivates my character.

50:42.525 --> 50:43.691
           Okay, fine,

50:43.693 --> 50:45.126
         but that means
     I have to go with you,

50:45.128 --> 50:47.295
      which, in turn, means
you're endangering my life, too,

50:47.297 --> 50:49.831
     but sure, let's do it.

50:51.200 --> 50:52.767
              Okay.

50:52.769 --> 50:55.236
  I will take the list to Lynn,
 and I'll have her talk to him.

50:55.238 --> 50:57.505
          There you go,
     that's a wiser choice.

50:57.507 --> 51:00.274
  Thankfully, following reason
   is part of your character.

51:13.122 --> 51:14.489
I know what you're thinking.

51:14.491 --> 51:16.224
That someone smart enough
to pull off what this guy has

51:16.226 --> 51:18.459
isn't going to check out
books with his blueprints.

51:18.461 --> 51:21.696
      But most criminals make
      at least one dumb mistake.

51:21.698 --> 51:23.498
   Did you check Perry's alibi
         for both cases?

51:27.403 --> 51:28.903
     I'm not answering that.

51:31.040 --> 51:32.674
             He doesn't like me
             very much, does he?

51:32.676 --> 51:36.244
   It's strange how he can be
     so blind to your charm.

51:37.379 --> 51:38.746
                      Well then,

51:38.748 --> 51:39.714
     I'm just going to just
     have to answer my questions

51:39.716 --> 51:40.948
                  in my own way.

51:40.950 --> 51:41.916
         Don't do that.

51:41.918 --> 51:43.051
        Roe, I'm serious.

51:55.664 --> 51:58.499
I can't tell
who he's talking to.

51:58.501 --> 52:00.902
       I'm still trying to
       get mine in proper focus.

52:03.272 --> 52:04.972
Can't you two
find another place

52:04.974 --> 52:06.774
to play your little
spy game?

52:06.776 --> 52:08.209
                 Well, you have
                 the best window

52:08.211 --> 52:10.044
                    for where
                    Perry works.

52:10.046 --> 52:14.082
We'll try
          to use our spy voices.

52:15.451 --> 52:17.018
Looks like
they're fighting.

52:17.020 --> 52:19.087
I don't know who
the man is, do you?

52:19.089 --> 52:20.688
             I've seen him
             on the golf course.

52:22.691 --> 52:24.659
Oh, he pushed him.

52:24.661 --> 52:26.394
                 There you go,
                 violent, angry.

52:26.396 --> 52:27.729
Hotheaded.

52:27.731 --> 52:30.364
         Too hotheaded.

52:30.366 --> 52:32.100
   I don't think Mamie Wright
     and Morrison Pettigrue

52:32.102 --> 52:35.069
        were attacked by someone
        hotheaded or impulsive.

52:35.071 --> 52:36.204
The crimes do seem
to be the work

52:36.206 --> 52:37.572
of a cool
and calculating head.

52:37.574 --> 52:39.540
                It just doesn't
                feel like Perry.

52:39.542 --> 52:40.575
Excuse me,

52:40.577 --> 52:42.510
I'd like to get
to my files.

52:42.512 --> 52:44.245
 Sorry, we know
 you hate this muck.

52:44.247 --> 52:45.480
I had to promise her

52:45.482 --> 52:47.281
I'd never bring up
the Lizzie Borden case again.

52:47.283 --> 52:48.750
Oh, I looked at
the Borden case

52:48.752 --> 52:50.618
as a possible model
for a copycat.

52:50.620 --> 52:51.753
It's a good thing
that we don't have

52:51.755 --> 52:54.155
any Sunday school teachers
in the club.

52:54.157 --> 52:57.024
Or female members who still
live with her parents.

52:57.026 --> 52:58.726
               Well, just Sally,

52:58.728 --> 53:00.194
              she's staying with
              her dad and...

53:00.196 --> 53:02.296
   her stepmother.

53:02.298 --> 53:03.397
Wasn't Lizzie Borden's
stepmother

53:03.399 --> 53:05.099
 the one who got the 40 whacks?

53:08.604 --> 53:10.438
     With a hatchet.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.406
       Wait, but there are no
       other similarities there,

53:12.408 --> 53:13.374
             right?

53:13.376 --> 53:15.343
  Sally doesn't have a sister,

53:15.345 --> 53:17.478
   her father's not a banker,

53:17.480 --> 53:18.846
          and her name
   is nowhere near Elizabeth.

53:18.848 --> 53:20.681
      Well, her middle name
          is Elizabeth.

53:20.683 --> 53:21.783
              What?

53:21.785 --> 53:23.317
      How do you know that?

53:23.319 --> 53:25.119
   I got her that monogrammed
     purse for her birthday,

53:25.121 --> 53:26.020
            remember?

53:27.489 --> 53:28.523
       I gotta call Sally.

53:36.498 --> 53:38.800
      Sally, why aren't you
           picking up?

53:38.802 --> 53:40.902
   And why didn't you tell me
 your middle name was Elizabeth?

53:40.904 --> 53:42.069
        <i> Hi, it's Sally.</i>
        <i> Leave a message.</i>

53:42.071 --> 53:43.471
  Hey, do you remember my list?

53:43.473 --> 53:44.705
     You are number one now.

53:44.707 --> 53:46.707
    I mean, your parents are.

53:46.709 --> 53:47.642
     But we have to get them
           to safety.

53:47.644 --> 53:48.643
      You've gotta call me.

53:48.645 --> 53:49.710
  We have to warn the Allisons.

53:49.712 --> 53:51.145
       Mother, do you have
          a phone book?

53:51.147 --> 53:52.513
       Yeah, I believe so.

53:52.515 --> 53:53.714
I'll look online.

53:53.716 --> 53:55.817
  I know where their house is.
        I'm going to go.

53:55.819 --> 53:56.751
      Call me when you find
           the number.

53:56.753 --> 53:57.785
               Oh.

53:57.787 --> 54:00.288
     Don't let her go alone.

54:42.297 --> 54:43.497
           Yes, I know
     what "unlisted" means,

54:43.499 --> 54:44.899
    but this is an emergency.

54:46.134 --> 54:48.169
    Never mind, I can get it.

54:52.208 --> 54:54.075
       They're not listed.

54:54.077 --> 54:56.611
     City property records.

55:18.033 --> 55:19.467
        Lillian, please.

55:19.469 --> 55:21.402
 Just walk to the bulletin board
       in the break room,

55:21.404 --> 55:23.104
and get me Bud Allison's number.

55:23.106 --> 55:24.272
            You know
     it's against the rules

55:24.274 --> 55:25.339
     to leave the front desk
            unmanned.

55:25.341 --> 55:27.508
           Just do it!

55:27.510 --> 55:29.877
   Why would I break the rules

55:29.879 --> 55:33.581
           for someone
     who's screeching at me?

55:46.595 --> 55:48.095
        Addison, Akins...

55:48.097 --> 55:49.230
            Allison!

55:54.736 --> 55:56.404
    Mother, did you find it?

55:56.406 --> 55:57.872
        Yeah, I just did,

55:57.874 --> 56:00.308
    but what do I say to them
   that doesn't sound insane?

56:00.310 --> 56:01.475
    <i> Just give me the number,</i>

56:01.477 --> 56:03.210
           I'll call.
  They're used to my insanity.

56:14.356 --> 56:15.423
             Hello?

56:15.425 --> 56:16.557
   <i> Mrs. Allison, it's Aurora!</i>

56:16.559 --> 56:18.626
        I'm worried that
     you're in great danger.

56:18.628 --> 56:20.861
Carol,
call the police!

56:20.863 --> 56:24.065
    <i> Aurora, I've got to go.</i>
       <i> I'm calling 9-1-1.</i>

56:33.842 --> 56:35.109
          Oh, my gosh.

56:35.111 --> 56:36.177
          Are you okay?

56:36.179 --> 56:37.845
                  The police are
                  on their way.

56:37.847 --> 56:39.847
         What happened?

56:39.849 --> 56:41.282
            You saved Bud's life
            by calling,

56:41.284 --> 56:42.283
           that's what happened.

56:42.285 --> 56:43.150
                  And mine, too.

56:44.619 --> 56:46.120
     I just got your message
        and rushed over.

56:46.122 --> 56:47.154
      Did something happen?

56:47.156 --> 56:48.255
There's been
an incident.

56:48.257 --> 56:49.323
     But we're okay, honey.

56:51.493 --> 56:52.593
                 Here they come.

57:00.469 --> 57:02.203
Look, guys, look.

57:04.706 --> 57:06.273
                Bud Allison says

57:06.275 --> 57:07.908
      the hatchet was coming
      straight down for his head

57:07.910 --> 57:09.143
                  when the phone
                  woke him up.

57:09.145 --> 57:10.211
       Who was holding it?

57:10.213 --> 57:11.645
         He didn't see.

57:11.647 --> 57:12.880
      I sent an officer out
           to find out

57:12.882 --> 57:14.615
    if Perry Dell was working
          an hour ago.

57:14.617 --> 57:16.250
Oh, yeah, he was.
We, uh--

57:16.252 --> 57:17.351
We saw him working

57:17.353 --> 57:18.652
from Aida's office,
across the street.

57:21.190 --> 57:22.590
    Every member of your club
          has an alibi

57:22.592 --> 57:23.758
for at least one of the murders,

57:23.760 --> 57:24.859
        except for Perry,

57:24.861 --> 57:26.527
   and you just ruled him out.

57:26.529 --> 57:28.629
           So it isn't
     someone from the club?

57:28.631 --> 57:29.663
That's a relief.

57:29.665 --> 57:30.898
         Yeah, for you.

57:30.900 --> 57:32.199
       Now I have to widen
      my pool of suspects.

57:32.201 --> 57:33.701
Smith!

57:33.703 --> 57:35.736
I am so sick and tired
of this garbage--

57:35.738 --> 57:36.737
                  Hey, hey, hey!

57:36.739 --> 57:37.872
                Before you start
                to yell at me

57:37.874 --> 57:39.006
                 for talking
                 with civilians,

57:39.008 --> 57:40.674
              you should know
              that this civilian

57:40.676 --> 57:42.443
       just prevented a tragedy.

57:42.445 --> 57:44.712
           So we definitely need
           to talk with her,

57:44.714 --> 57:46.080
             at least this time.

57:47.449 --> 57:48.649
       Where's forensics?

57:48.651 --> 57:50.351
      They should be here,
     looking for footprints.

57:50.353 --> 57:51.452
                 Get this rabble
                 out of here,

57:51.454 --> 57:53.854
they're trampling
all over everything!

57:53.856 --> 57:55.156
   Don't look at me like that.

57:55.158 --> 57:56.524
This doesn't mean we're buddies.

57:56.526 --> 57:57.792
       Right, 'cause that
       would be so silly.

57:58.894 --> 58:00.327
Is it true

58:00.329 --> 58:01.429
you were almost
hacked with an axe?

58:01.431 --> 58:02.797
       Did you get a look
        at your attacker?

58:02.799 --> 58:03.931
     Do you have any kind of
       description at all?

58:03.933 --> 58:05.366
         Give them room!

58:05.368 --> 58:06.901
         After they give
        their statements,

58:06.903 --> 58:07.802
       they'll be able to
  speak with you if they want.

58:07.804 --> 58:09.904
        For now, back up!

58:09.906 --> 58:10.905
             She's the one
             you should talk to,

58:10.907 --> 58:12.173
               Aurora Teagarden.

58:12.175 --> 58:13.340
She saved us.

58:13.342 --> 58:14.875
Go, go.
Take my truck.

58:14.877 --> 58:16.844
         Miss Teagarden!
         Miss Teagarden!

58:16.846 --> 58:17.978
            I'll keep
   the marauding horde at bay.

58:17.980 --> 58:19.480
Ladies and gentlemen
of the press,

58:19.482 --> 58:22.516
    uh, how may I assist you?

58:38.800 --> 58:40.701
Mother, I'm fine, really.

58:40.703 --> 58:41.702
            I'm home,

58:41.704 --> 58:44.872
    and I'll lock the doors.

58:44.874 --> 58:47.775
     Besides, Robin's here.

58:47.777 --> 58:48.776
  Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

58:48.778 --> 58:50.344
           I love you.

58:53.448 --> 58:55.382
    It's all over the radio.

58:55.384 --> 58:58.552
    You saving the Allisons.

58:58.554 --> 58:59.553
         You all right?

58:59.555 --> 59:01.122
              Yeah.

59:04.526 --> 59:06.427
        Oh, I missed it!

59:06.429 --> 59:08.562
 I... I missed the similarities,

59:08.564 --> 59:09.630
   and I was almost too late.

59:09.632 --> 59:11.098
        But you weren't.

59:11.100 --> 59:13.901
     Now the police, they've
     ruled out the club members,

59:13.903 --> 59:16.904
     and now the list
     of suspects is so wide now,

59:16.906 --> 59:18.472
        it's impossible.

59:20.809 --> 59:23.577
    No, it's not impossible.

59:23.579 --> 59:25.079
        I did figure out

59:25.081 --> 59:27.848
      that Sally's parents
     were likely to be next.

59:27.850 --> 59:30.017
    If I can just figure out
        who's next sooner

59:30.019 --> 59:31.552
    so the police are waiting

59:31.554 --> 59:32.720
         when he tries it again.

59:32.722 --> 59:34.255
  Okay, well, I'm here to help.

59:37.959 --> 59:39.760
Okay,

59:39.762 --> 59:40.895
            we'll put
     all of the club members

59:40.897 --> 59:42.429
          at the top...

59:42.431 --> 59:44.598
       and then we'll put
  the elements of all the cases

59:44.600 --> 59:46.066
            below it,

59:46.068 --> 59:47.535
   and then we'll see how many
    connections we can make.

59:47.537 --> 59:49.403
             Right.

59:49.405 --> 59:52.640
           Okay, yeah,
     so, for example, uh...

59:52.642 --> 59:54.675
     the Laura Landry case.

59:54.677 --> 59:55.976
       We'll put it here.
              Tape?

59:55.978 --> 59:57.878
  Yeah, we'll just... do this.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.813
    See, she was a librarian,

59:59.815 --> 01:00:02.950
   so, that's the connection.

01:00:02.952 --> 01:00:04.385
        It's interesting.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.054
              What?

01:00:07.056 --> 01:00:10.124
  Oh, I just, I do all of this
 because it helps me visualize.

01:00:10.126 --> 01:00:11.592
                     No, no,
                     it's funny,

01:00:11.594 --> 01:00:12.726
   because I do the same thing
          when I write.

01:00:19.434 --> 01:00:21.335
No distracting
each other.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:23.337
             Right.

01:01:42.584 --> 01:01:44.485
          Okay, sorry.

01:01:44.487 --> 01:01:45.786
I left a message
for Dory.

01:01:45.788 --> 01:01:46.820
                    I just spoke
                    to LeMaster.

01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:47.855
I hated calling early.

01:01:47.857 --> 01:01:49.056
                      Yeah.

01:01:49.058 --> 01:01:50.824
          It's pretty clear
          who matches what case.

01:01:50.826 --> 01:01:52.593
Yeah, all the parallels

01:01:52.595 --> 01:01:54.795
        to Dory's family
       and the Hunt case--

01:01:54.797 --> 01:01:56.430
         it's got to be
        her husband next.

01:01:56.432 --> 01:01:57.531
Or LeMaster.

01:02:06.508 --> 01:02:08.142
Hi. What's the matter?

01:02:08.144 --> 01:02:09.176
Is it your parents?

01:02:09.178 --> 01:02:10.611
      Oh, no, they're fine.

01:02:10.613 --> 01:02:12.112
                      Sorry. Hi.

01:02:12.114 --> 01:02:13.747
   No, I'm just really tired,

01:02:13.749 --> 01:02:16.450
 because I've been up all night
   putting my story together.

01:02:16.452 --> 01:02:17.885
What, about
the attack?

01:02:17.887 --> 01:02:19.019
                   Yeah. Oh! No.

01:02:19.021 --> 01:02:20.954
        About the police
       finding the hatchet

01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:22.189
   that nearly killed my Dad.

01:02:22.191 --> 01:02:23.724
What! They...

01:02:23.726 --> 01:02:24.858
     They found the hatchet?

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:26.193
Yes, about a block
from my parents' house.

01:02:26.195 --> 01:02:27.594
        It was wrapped up

01:02:27.596 --> 01:02:29.096
   in one of Benjamin Greer's
        old work aprons.

01:02:29.098 --> 01:02:31.198
They dragged him in
for questioning.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.933
     It took me forever
     to get the details.

01:02:32.935 --> 01:02:34.101
           Oh, coffee.

01:02:34.103 --> 01:02:35.869
The police must be
assuming it's another plant.

01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:36.937
         Yes, they are.

01:02:36.939 --> 01:02:37.938
                     Yeah, they
                     have to be.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.606
                 I mean, whoever
                 is doing this

01:02:39.608 --> 01:02:41.075
               wants the weapons
               to be found.

01:02:41.077 --> 01:02:44.044
 So then why haven't they found
   the weapon in Mamie's case?

01:02:44.046 --> 01:02:45.612
  I mean, it has to be planted,
           too, right?

01:02:45.614 --> 01:02:48.182
             The diagram queen's
             been at it again.

01:02:48.184 --> 01:02:50.017
 Let's go look for what was used
      in that first attack.

01:02:54.789 --> 01:02:56.523
Lynn needs
to see this.

01:02:57.892 --> 01:02:59.626
Sorry.

01:03:18.313 --> 01:03:20.080
: That's Mamie
       and Gerald's house.

01:03:20.082 --> 01:03:21.915
: Got it.

01:03:35.997 --> 01:03:37.231
             Okay...

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:40.968
                 Let's split up.

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:42.236
Okay.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.808
          Oh.

01:04:22.343 --> 01:04:24.211
             Sorry!

01:04:24.213 --> 01:04:25.913
             Sorry.

01:04:50.371 --> 01:04:52.105
       We've searched two blocks
       in every direction.

01:04:52.107 --> 01:04:54.475
            I don't think
            we're gonna find it.

01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:57.578
Maybe we're
trying too hard.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.747
    If the weapon was planted
         to be found...

01:05:00.749 --> 01:05:02.883
           It would be in
           a more obvious place.

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:06.587
           Yeah, like
    that manhole right there.

01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:07.588
Oh, that's too easy.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:09.423
            It's a little askew.

01:05:16.064 --> 01:05:17.231
             Okay...

01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:36.049
     That looks like my bag.

01:05:46.561 --> 01:05:48.328
 Yeah, that's my bag, all right.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:50.230
Well, let's open it up.

01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:51.532
          I don't know if I like

01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:53.066
        being the first reporter
        on the scene.

01:05:59.707 --> 01:06:01.542
A hammer?

01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:02.709
        Most authors say

01:06:02.711 --> 01:06:04.177
        that a fire poker
      killed Julia Wallace.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.347
       The murder weapon,
        in my stolen bag.

01:06:19.528 --> 01:06:21.194
    Lynn is gonna be steamed

01:06:21.196 --> 01:06:22.696
    her team didn't find this
      after Mamie's death,

01:06:22.698 --> 01:06:26.466
 but we didn't know to look for
     a planted weapon then.

01:06:26.468 --> 01:06:27.634
          I'  happy to answer
          any questions you have

01:06:27.636 --> 01:06:28.602
                 about that bag.

01:06:28.604 --> 01:06:29.636
        No. No questions.

01:06:29.638 --> 01:06:30.604
       You haven't heard?

01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:31.638
They got a confession!

01:06:32.807 --> 01:06:35.542
    Macon says Benjamin Greer
 just confessed to the killings.

01:06:35.544 --> 01:06:38.211
 They're gonna have a briefing,
           I gotta go.

01:06:38.213 --> 01:06:39.513
       Benjamin confessed?

01:06:39.515 --> 01:06:41.815
    Yeah, about an hour into
      Lynn interviewing him

01:06:41.817 --> 01:06:44.351
about the apron
that hatchet was wrapped in.

01:06:44.353 --> 01:06:46.286
     He said he was the one,
      said he just snapped.

01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:49.656
No, these crimes were planned,

01:06:49.658 --> 01:06:51.658
       a snap doesn't fit.

01:06:51.660 --> 01:06:54.328
   And Lynn said that Benjamin
 had an alibi for Mamie's case.

01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:56.096
    Yeah, Morrison Pettigrue,

01:06:56.098 --> 01:06:57.598
       victim Number Two.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.632
He provided
a fake alibi for Greer

01:06:58.634 --> 01:06:59.800
and probably died for it.

01:06:59.802 --> 01:07:00.701
        It all fits, Roe.

01:07:03.171 --> 01:07:05.205
     Did Benjamin tell Lynn
     where he hid the weapon

01:07:05.207 --> 01:07:06.173
       used to kill Mamie?

01:07:06.175 --> 01:07:07.207
Probably not,

01:07:07.209 --> 01:07:08.175
'cause she would have
sent someone

01:07:08.177 --> 01:07:09.309
to pick it up already.

01:07:09.311 --> 01:07:10.410
          Okay, no, no,

01:07:10.412 --> 01:07:12.346
       you have to ask him
        about the weapon.

01:07:12.348 --> 01:07:15.349
       Ask him what it was
        and where it was.

01:07:15.351 --> 01:07:16.583
               Okay, Roe, I know
               how sharp you are

01:07:16.585 --> 01:07:18.151
                    and how much
                    you care,

01:07:18.153 --> 01:07:19.353
      but just 'cause you didn't
      solve the crime yourself,

01:07:19.355 --> 01:07:21.355
           doesn't mean
           it didn't get solved.

01:07:21.357 --> 01:07:22.556
No, you have to ask him.

01:07:22.558 --> 01:07:24.791
What if he didn't do it?

01:07:24.793 --> 01:07:26.193
         You're the one
        that talked about

01:07:26.195 --> 01:07:27.527
        the psychology of
 false confessions for the club.

01:07:27.529 --> 01:07:29.196
          I'll make sure
          he's asked, I promise.

01:07:29.198 --> 01:07:30.764
Because
if he doesn't know,

01:07:30.766 --> 01:07:32.799
and you don't have
the right guy,

01:07:32.801 --> 01:07:34.868
and he's still out there,

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:36.403
I think I know
the next potential victim.

01:07:36.405 --> 01:07:38.271
We made
this diagram.

01:07:38.273 --> 01:07:39.473
   Yeah, I want to
  give it to Lynn.

01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:40.307
                   Okay, I'll
                   let her know.

01:07:43.244 --> 01:07:45.379
                 I need to get
                 to my computer.

01:07:48.916 --> 01:07:50.617
              Most books say
              that Julia Wallace

01:07:50.619 --> 01:07:52.719
         was likely killed by
         the missing fire poker,

01:07:52.721 --> 01:07:53.920
               but Bankston said

01:07:53.922 --> 01:07:55.455
         that Scotland Yard
         had a different theory.

01:07:56.591 --> 01:07:58.425
              Here.

01:07:58.427 --> 01:08:00.394
      The only Wallace book
         I haven't read,

01:08:00.396 --> 01:08:02.629
 "Searching for Scotland Yard."

01:08:02.631 --> 01:08:04.798
      "A Scotland Yard detective
      told a London paper

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.267
"that he believed
the injuries were consistent

01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:09.770
with a hammer."

01:08:11.239 --> 01:08:14.541
 Robin, Bankston read that book!

01:08:14.543 --> 01:08:17.477
      He thinks the weapon
          was a hammer.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.147
          But Bankston
    can't have killed Mamie.

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:21.214
          You're his alibi.

01:08:21.216 --> 01:08:22.482
                          Right.

01:08:22.484 --> 01:08:23.850
         Yeah, I mean, I saw him
         walking to his car

01:08:23.852 --> 01:08:25.752
at the time of the murder,

01:08:25.754 --> 01:08:28.321
       so it can't be him.

01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:30.290
 Unless Bankston has a partner.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.794
             A partner,
             that's interesting.

01:08:33.796 --> 01:08:36.529
            But who?

01:08:36.532 --> 01:08:37.430
            Benjamin.

01:08:38.566 --> 01:08:40.734
      That's a possibility.

01:08:40.736 --> 01:08:42.368
        But, no, they...

01:08:42.371 --> 01:08:44.136
   they weren't really close.

01:08:44.139 --> 01:08:45.238
I mean, the only person

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.640
that Bankston
was close to in the club

01:08:46.642 --> 01:08:47.607
was Melanie.

01:08:49.277 --> 01:08:50.911
It has to be Melanie.

01:08:50.912 --> 01:08:52.845
I provided Bankston
his alibi

01:08:52.848 --> 01:08:54.814
so that he could
provide one for her.

01:08:54.817 --> 01:08:57.050
                 Right, so let's
                 call Lynn.

01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:00.020
                        No.

01:09:00.022 --> 01:09:01.787
           Lynn already has
           a confession in hand,

01:09:01.790 --> 01:09:03.756
          all we have is
          a reference in a book.

01:09:03.759 --> 01:09:05.392
           I need hard evidence.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.295
      Where are you going?
    You're making me nervous.

01:09:11.733 --> 01:09:13.265
            His car's not there.

01:09:13.268 --> 01:09:14.434
                  He's not home.

01:09:14.435 --> 01:09:15.368
                 I'm going to go
                 to his house

01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:16.569
                and see if I can
                find anything.

01:09:16.572 --> 01:09:17.604
You what?

01:09:17.606 --> 01:09:18.705
Are you allowed
to do that?

01:09:18.707 --> 01:09:20.307
    I'm the property manager.

01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:21.475
        I have the keys.

01:09:21.477 --> 01:09:22.509
              I don't like this.

01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:38.390
I respect your bravery,
but I don't know,

01:09:38.393 --> 01:09:40.060
this could be
kind of dangerous.

01:09:40.062 --> 01:09:42.295
                 This might be
                 my only chance.

01:09:42.296 --> 01:09:44.296
Just for the record,
I think this is a bad idea.

01:09:50.604 --> 01:09:54.241
       Just be my lookout.

01:09:54.243 --> 01:09:55.509
Hurry.

01:10:02.918 --> 01:10:04.384
             Okay...

01:10:22.004 --> 01:10:23.136
                 And you're sure

01:10:23.138 --> 01:10:24.538
             the clerk got
             a good look at you?

01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:25.906
      I told him we needed
  a wake-up call at 6:00 a.m.,

01:10:25.908 --> 01:10:28.408
    so as long as we're there
 to answer the phone by 6:00...

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.609
             He'll swear we were
             there all night.

01:10:29.611 --> 01:10:30.677
              Yes, now,

01:10:30.679 --> 01:10:32.712
          how do we handle
         Dory's stupid dog?

01:10:32.714 --> 01:10:34.714
         The same way we handled
         her stupid husband--

01:10:34.716 --> 01:10:36.550
Did you find anything?

01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:40.420
             Oh, no.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:43.924
                   Easy...

01:10:43.926 --> 01:10:44.925
                   Easy.

01:10:44.927 --> 01:10:47.294
            Melanie,
            lock the front door.

01:10:47.296 --> 01:10:48.361
Mm-hmm.

01:10:50.631 --> 01:10:51.698
Oh, great.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.900
               You were right.

01:10:53.902 --> 01:10:56.903
           A very bad, bad idea.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:10.851
    Well, both cars are here,
     so she should be here.

01:11:21.196 --> 01:11:22.863
Aurora!

01:11:22.865 --> 01:11:24.030
        It's me!

01:11:24.032 --> 01:11:25.899
           You left her
           a message telling her

01:11:25.901 --> 01:11:27.200
                   she still had
                   my car keys,

01:11:27.202 --> 01:11:28.568
              and we'd be coming
              back to get them?

01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:32.005
Yeah. She knows I can get in,
so maybe she left them for you.

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.779
Aurora!

01:11:45.186 --> 01:11:47.187
 Well, there's no keys in here.

01:11:48.322 --> 01:11:49.923
She's not here.

01:11:51.993 --> 01:11:54.628
But her phone
and her purse are.

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.530
              Her laptop is open
              on the table.

01:11:57.532 --> 01:11:59.900
  Maybe she's with the writer.

01:12:06.007 --> 01:12:07.140
                Detective Smith.

01:12:07.142 --> 01:12:08.174
    I need to speak with Roe.

01:12:08.176 --> 01:12:09.142
          Is she home?

01:12:09.144 --> 01:12:10.343
                        No.

01:12:10.345 --> 01:12:11.912
         Her cell phone
    and purse are here, but--

01:12:11.914 --> 01:12:13.280
             We're thinking she
             might be next door,

01:12:13.282 --> 01:12:15.815
             with Robin Daniels.

01:12:15.817 --> 01:12:16.816
Daniels didn't answer.

01:12:16.818 --> 01:12:18.018
        She's not there?

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.252
You have any idea
where she is?

01:12:19.254 --> 01:12:21.021
 It's urgent we speak with her.

01:12:21.023 --> 01:12:23.089
           She left her computer
           open on the table.

01:12:23.091 --> 01:12:24.858
              Maybe that'll
              tell us something.

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:25.759
                        Come on.

01:12:27.428 --> 01:12:30.130
      She was reading about
        the Wallace case.

01:12:30.132 --> 01:12:31.298
          I wonder why.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.866
   You've already got the man
        who killed Mamie.

01:12:32.868 --> 01:12:33.900
That's the problem.

01:12:33.902 --> 01:12:35.001
            We don't.

01:12:35.003 --> 01:12:37.003
         Benjamin Greer
        confessed, but--

01:12:37.005 --> 01:12:38.905
But he didn't know
details he should have,

01:12:38.907 --> 01:12:41.074
which Roe predicted.

01:12:41.076 --> 01:12:42.275
         You don't have
    the right person in jail?

01:12:42.277 --> 01:12:43.510
               No.

01:12:43.512 --> 01:12:44.611
         Greer confessed
          that he lied

01:12:44.613 --> 01:12:46.546
        because he liked
      being on television.

01:12:46.548 --> 01:12:47.514
   The idiot wasted our time.

01:12:47.516 --> 01:12:49.215
Now, Roe said she knew

01:12:49.217 --> 01:12:51.017
who the next victims
were likely to be,

01:12:51.019 --> 01:12:52.452
said she made
some sort of diagram?

01:12:52.454 --> 01:12:53.586
   This is just
   what I was afraid of!

01:12:53.588 --> 01:12:56.423
       She's at it again!

01:12:56.425 --> 01:12:57.891
   No, I'm not going to panic.

01:12:57.893 --> 01:12:59.960
She might be
with Robin after all.

01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:01.928
     I mean, maybe they just
     didn't hear your knock.

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:04.464
Well, I can go
bang on the door again.

01:13:04.466 --> 01:13:05.432
  Or I could give you the key.

01:13:05.434 --> 01:13:06.733
            I wonder why it says

01:13:06.735 --> 01:13:07.934
       the weapon in the Wallace
       case was a hammer?

01:13:07.936 --> 01:13:10.437
            Everyone knows
            it was a fire poker.

01:13:10.439 --> 01:13:13.673
      Though didn't someone
       at our last meeting

01:13:13.675 --> 01:13:14.908
                   argue against
                   the poker?

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:15.909
Yeah, that's right.

01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:17.010
Wait, was it LeMaster?

01:13:17.012 --> 01:13:18.044
                    No, it was--

01:13:18.046 --> 01:13:19.412
            Bankston!

01:13:19.414 --> 01:13:21.147
           That's it.

01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:23.216
            Roe's led us to him.

01:13:23.218 --> 01:13:25.452
   But how did you know that?

01:13:25.454 --> 01:13:27.287
   Bankston's key is missing.
      Roe probably has it.

01:13:27.289 --> 01:13:29.055
She's over
in Bankston's townhouse.

01:13:35.097 --> 01:13:36.196
        Police!

01:13:36.198 --> 01:13:37.797
Open the door, Bankston!

01:13:39.233 --> 01:13:40.100
         Knock it down.

01:13:41.435 --> 01:13:42.669
               Ow.

01:13:42.671 --> 01:13:43.670
              Nope.

01:13:43.672 --> 01:13:44.671
         No.

01:13:44.673 --> 01:13:46.006
                  Let him do it.

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.153
Anything?

01:14:00.155 --> 01:14:01.121
                 I'm afraid not,
                 Detective.

01:14:01.123 --> 01:14:02.288
         She's not here?

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:03.890
I got something.

01:14:05.994 --> 01:14:07.027
        It's chloroform.

01:14:14.036 --> 01:14:16.369
: Roe...

01:14:16.371 --> 01:14:17.937
: Robin...

01:14:17.939 --> 01:14:19.172
                      Bankston--

01:14:19.174 --> 01:14:20.974
He knocked us out
with something.

01:14:24.278 --> 01:14:26.479
                 Oh, chloroform.

01:14:26.481 --> 01:14:28.148
                  The Hunt case.

01:14:29.717 --> 01:14:34.287
          You were getting ready
          to copy the Hunt case.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.461
                  We were right.

01:14:41.463 --> 01:14:42.929
                  Dory's husband
                  was next.

01:14:45.066 --> 01:14:47.233
You think you're
so smart, don't you?

01:14:47.235 --> 01:14:49.302
     All of you in the club,

01:14:49.304 --> 01:14:52.038
       you think you know
    the answer to everything.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.306
         Especially her.

01:14:54.675 --> 01:14:56.509
Ah, she's not
as bad as John.

01:14:56.511 --> 01:14:58.144
              After my last talk

01:14:58.146 --> 01:14:59.345
           about the Deaton case
           in Georgia,

01:14:59.347 --> 01:15:05.018
       John sent me a three-page
       letter of errors.

01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.220
          Three pages.

01:15:08.223 --> 01:15:09.089
         Pompous idiot.

01:15:10.524 --> 01:15:12.625
  That's why you killed Mamie?

01:15:12.627 --> 01:15:14.360
         And Morrison Pettigrue?

01:15:14.362 --> 01:15:16.429
         Wounded pride?

01:15:16.431 --> 01:15:19.099
No.

01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:20.200
         It was to prove

01:15:20.202 --> 01:15:22.602
        that Bankston has
    the real mind for murder.

01:15:22.604 --> 01:15:24.104
                        Melanie.

01:15:24.106 --> 01:15:26.639
                 Remember
                 what we agreed?

01:15:26.641 --> 01:15:28.174
        No explanations,
       no justifications.

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:30.510
Right.

01:15:30.512 --> 01:15:32.145
We did.

01:15:34.482 --> 01:15:36.116
                     I'll go get
                     more books.

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:38.651
          Well, can you
        at least tell us

01:15:38.653 --> 01:15:41.654
     why your minion is off
  on a reading fest right now?

01:15:43.090 --> 01:15:44.557
          Aurora knows.

01:15:44.559 --> 01:15:45.425
         Don't you, Roe?

01:15:48.028 --> 01:15:50.663
     Remember Laura Landry,

01:15:50.665 --> 01:15:51.598
        from our diagram?

01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:54.701
      Yeah, the librarian.

01:15:54.703 --> 01:15:57.737
         She was killed
      by a spurned suitor.

01:15:57.739 --> 01:15:59.239
How'd he do it again?

01:15:59.241 --> 01:16:00.373
        Beat her to death

01:16:00.375 --> 01:16:01.808
        with the Campion
       English Dictionary,

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:05.445
    and then staged her body
     under a pile of books.

01:16:05.447 --> 01:16:07.747
          But wasn't it
        a murder-suicide?

01:16:07.749 --> 01:16:09.949
            Didn't he
    hang himself afterwards?

01:16:11.185 --> 01:16:12.352
            Exactly.

01:16:17.224 --> 01:16:20.026
 Aurora Teagarden, female, 30s,

01:16:20.028 --> 01:16:23.196
and Robin Daniels, male, 30s...

01:16:23.198 --> 01:16:25.465
    Wha... What is going on?

01:16:25.467 --> 01:16:26.766
Can you go
have a look?

01:16:26.768 --> 01:16:28.334
                    Where's Roe?
                    Is she okay?

01:16:28.336 --> 01:16:30.503
        No. I don't know.

01:16:30.505 --> 01:16:31.905
She's missing.

01:16:31.907 --> 01:16:33.239
It seems she's figured out
that Bankston is the copycat.

01:16:33.241 --> 01:16:35.108
And he took her,

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:36.442
      and maybe Robin, too,

01:16:36.444 --> 01:16:37.443
   and we have no idea where.

01:16:37.445 --> 01:16:38.478
John's going inside,

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.646
to try and
look up cases

01:16:39.648 --> 01:16:41.548
with either a writer
or librarian as a victim.

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:43.349
    But Roe already did that.

01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:44.717
       She made a diagram.

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:46.286
Yeah, we know, but it's not
in her house, not in her car.

01:16:46.288 --> 01:16:48.288
      Well, that's because
      it's in Robin's car.

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:49.622
  What?

01:16:49.624 --> 01:16:50.723
     You know, just in case

01:16:50.725 --> 01:16:52.258
it wasn't
clear enough before,

01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:53.826
               you people are
               sick in the head.

01:16:53.828 --> 01:16:56.629
: Right.

01:16:56.631 --> 01:16:58.198
   You plot murders every day
      and get paid for it.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.099
               You're a terrible
               copycat.

01:17:00.101 --> 01:17:02.569
Your first mistake
was the hammer.

01:17:02.571 --> 01:17:03.670
         Not a mistake.

01:17:03.672 --> 01:17:05.772
       Scotland Yard said
        it was a hammer.

01:17:05.774 --> 01:17:07.607
    And Laura Landry was hit
    in the back of the head,

01:17:07.609 --> 01:17:08.775
          not the side.

01:17:08.777 --> 01:17:09.776
       And not to mention,

01:17:09.778 --> 01:17:12.245
you're using
the 2010 version

01:17:12.247 --> 01:17:14.747
              of the dictionary,

01:17:14.749 --> 01:17:15.949
    when we have the version
     that was used on Laura

01:17:15.951 --> 01:17:17.684
          right there,
     in the rare book room.

01:17:17.686 --> 01:17:19.252
What are you doing?

01:17:20.521 --> 01:17:22.155
       You're helping them
    kill you more accurately?

01:17:22.157 --> 01:17:23.856
'Cause she has to be
a Know-It-All,

01:17:23.858 --> 01:17:25.625
right until the very end.

01:17:25.627 --> 01:17:26.726
                       Go ahead,

01:17:26.728 --> 01:17:28.761
           be sloppy.

01:17:28.763 --> 01:17:32.565
       The hammer was how
       I figured out it was you,

01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:33.866
      and all the mistakes
      you're about to make

01:17:33.868 --> 01:17:35.768
        is going to help
   someone else figure it out.

01:17:35.770 --> 01:17:37.237
                  Probably John.

01:17:37.239 --> 01:17:39.138
    He can spot your errors.

01:17:42.343 --> 01:17:44.277
              Fine.

01:17:44.279 --> 01:17:47.714
   It'll be... poetic justice

01:17:47.716 --> 01:17:49.415
           to kill you
   with the right dictionary.

01:17:51.218 --> 01:17:52.518
       Melanie, can you go
      to the rare book room

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:53.519
       and get the, uh...

01:17:53.521 --> 01:17:55.688
          1923 edition.

01:18:06.867 --> 01:18:08.034
Okay, just go
straight down with it,

01:18:08.036 --> 01:18:09.002
you're angling it.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.940
    You were taking too long.

01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:22.582
    Here it is, Laura Landry.

01:18:22.584 --> 01:18:23.616
      She was a librarian,

01:18:23.618 --> 01:18:25.051
        she was killed in
          the library.

01:18:25.053 --> 01:18:26.419
          The library!
  Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:18:36.897 --> 01:18:38.197
Why are you
           taunting them?

01:18:38.199 --> 01:18:39.299
    I don't think you should
   be taunting them right now.

01:18:39.301 --> 01:18:40.333
Shh, shh...

01:18:41.336 --> 01:18:42.335
                       Bankston!

01:18:42.337 --> 01:18:44.070
               The door's stuck!

01:18:44.072 --> 01:18:45.171
                 I can't get it.

01:18:45.173 --> 01:18:46.272
         Just forget it!

01:18:49.243 --> 01:18:50.810
              Sloppy...

01:18:54.982 --> 01:18:56.049
        All right, wait.

01:18:56.051 --> 01:18:57.350
                     I'm coming.

01:19:05.259 --> 01:19:07.360
       Okay, back to back.

01:19:07.362 --> 01:19:08.328
                      What?

01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:09.228
Back to back.

01:19:21.141 --> 01:19:22.141
Back to back.

01:19:22.143 --> 01:19:23.476
                Get yours first.

01:19:23.478 --> 01:19:26.179
                    Okay, hurry.

01:19:26.181 --> 01:19:27.146
      Hurry, get it. Hurry.

01:19:27.148 --> 01:19:28.181
            Hurry...

01:19:28.183 --> 01:19:29.349
             There.

01:19:29.351 --> 01:19:31.217
             Wait...

01:19:31.219 --> 01:19:32.085
         Yeah, I got it.

01:19:34.221 --> 01:19:35.388
                        Hang on.

01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:36.389
                          Hurry.

01:19:36.391 --> 01:19:37.490
                     I'm trying.

01:19:37.492 --> 01:19:38.358
  Hurry...

01:19:40.928 --> 01:19:41.961
            Finally.

01:19:41.963 --> 01:19:43.162
All right,
hurry up and get it.

01:19:43.164 --> 01:19:43.963
         There's, like,
   a thousand books in there.

01:19:45.299 --> 01:19:46.566
         I can't get it.

01:19:46.568 --> 01:19:47.867
        What?

01:19:47.869 --> 01:19:48.968
        Ouch.

01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:51.304
            Just push your feet,
            push with your feet.

01:19:51.306 --> 01:19:52.872
  Can you not help me find it?

01:19:52.874 --> 01:19:54.107
    And leave them alone? No.

01:19:54.109 --> 01:19:55.007
Hurry.

01:19:57.411 --> 01:19:59.779
Just look for
the fattest books!

01:20:01.348 --> 01:20:03.182
        Go. Go get help.

01:20:03.184 --> 01:20:04.417
       Right now, come on.

01:20:07.354 --> 01:20:08.221
         I think this is
    kind of a waste of time.

01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:21.334
                   Where is she?

01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:25.171
        Roe? Oh, she, uh,
           she's gone.

01:20:25.173 --> 01:20:27.140
She went to
call the police.

01:20:27.142 --> 01:20:29.375
     If I were you, I would
   get out of here right now.

01:20:29.377 --> 01:20:30.977
     No. The door's locked.

01:20:30.979 --> 01:20:32.044
        She can't get out
         without a key,

01:20:32.046 --> 01:20:33.679
       and I've got hers.

01:20:33.681 --> 01:20:35.114
        She's still here.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:38.084
And I'm pretty sure

01:20:38.086 --> 01:20:40.353
when put this knife
to your throat,

01:20:40.355 --> 01:20:41.554
                   she'll come
                   running back.

01:20:43.490 --> 01:20:45.625
     You see, there's no way
        Aurora Teagarden

01:20:45.627 --> 01:20:47.360
   has a better mind for mur--

01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:55.001
              Nice.

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:57.370
Okay.

01:20:59.606 --> 01:21:00.940
You have should used
the 2010 version.

01:21:00.942 --> 01:21:02.041
It's heavier.

01:21:02.043 --> 01:21:03.109
                        Come on.

01:21:07.148 --> 01:21:10.116
  Bankston, the door is stuck!

01:21:11.352 --> 01:21:13.386
            Bankston?

01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:30.736
I should have
canceled this meeting.

01:21:30.738 --> 01:21:33.506
Real murderers were in
the Real Murders Club,

01:21:33.508 --> 01:21:35.007
how can this not be
the end of us?

01:21:35.009 --> 01:21:36.309
                Let's just go in
                and find out.

01:21:48.055 --> 01:21:50.256
        What's all this?

01:21:50.258 --> 01:21:51.491
                  Well, my story

01:21:51.493 --> 01:21:53.259
           about how you stopped
           Bankston and Melanie

01:21:53.261 --> 01:21:55.461
       made people curious to
       come see what we do here.

01:21:55.463 --> 01:21:57.563
That's so great, Sally.

01:21:57.565 --> 01:21:59.365
            She even quoted us
            correctly this time.

01:21:59.367 --> 01:22:01.434
        Okay, no teasing.

01:22:01.436 --> 01:22:03.636
Especially if I'm going to write
   a story about your business

01:22:03.638 --> 01:22:05.104
           this week.

01:22:05.106 --> 01:22:06.239
                      Oh, right.

01:22:06.241 --> 01:22:07.573
              Come with me then,
              Madam Reporter,

01:22:07.575 --> 01:22:10.209
       and let me get you some
       of Dory's famous cookies.

01:22:10.211 --> 01:22:11.077
                  Shall we?

01:22:12.212 --> 01:22:14.213
            -Mother!
            -Hey, hi.

01:22:14.215 --> 01:22:15.147
       Feigning interest?

01:22:15.149 --> 01:22:16.516
            Oh, I don't need to.

01:22:16.518 --> 01:22:17.950
                 John told me
                 that Robin here

01:22:17.952 --> 01:22:20.253
           is going to be making
           some remarks tonight,

01:22:20.255 --> 01:22:22.255
        and I'm quite interested
        to hear them.

01:22:22.257 --> 01:22:23.289
Well, thank you.

01:22:23.291 --> 01:22:24.257
I hope I don't
disappoint you

01:22:24.259 --> 01:22:25.291
and everybody else.

01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:26.659
                     Impossible.

01:22:26.661 --> 01:22:27.860
      In fact, you might be able
      to convince my daughter

01:22:27.862 --> 01:22:30.730
          that fiction is more
          interesting than fact.

01:22:30.732 --> 01:22:32.565
     Oh, that's impossible.

01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:34.400
            But he is
        pretty talented.

01:22:34.402 --> 01:22:36.068
                     Yes, he is.

01:22:39.507 --> 01:22:40.706
Okay.

01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.775
        I think you have
   another fan in the family.

01:22:42.777 --> 01:22:44.110
             I'm okay with that.

01:22:47.514 --> 01:22:49.248
No distractions.

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.516
I have a speech to make.

01:22:50.518 --> 01:22:52.785
                How am I
                distracting you?

01:22:52.787 --> 01:22:54.220
Like this.
