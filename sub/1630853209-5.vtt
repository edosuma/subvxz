WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:03.520
I always thought I was coming
to <i>you</i> when Charles died.

00:03.560 --> 00:04.680
So what am I supposed to do?

00:04.720 --> 00:07.280
Just wait, yet again, for this
maybe-sometime-never event?

00:07.320 --> 00:10.320
<i>My days of solitude
are drawing to a close.</i>

00:10.360 --> 00:12.080
<i>She's in love with me.</i>

00:12.120 --> 00:14.840
<i>And with her, I could be happy.</i>

00:14.880 --> 00:16.960
- She needs a husband.
- Who?

00:17.000 --> 00:20.120
<i>I'm taking my "little friend"
to Paris.</i>

00:20.160 --> 00:22.040
<i>When we return,</i>

00:22.080 --> 00:24.440
<i>she will move into Shibden
with me.</i>

00:24.480 --> 00:26.640
<i>Could Miss Walker spare you
for one or two nights</i>

00:26.680 --> 00:27.680
<i>to visit me at Lawton?</i>

00:27.720 --> 00:28.920
Come back.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.840
Everything I'd ever pinned
any happiness or hope on

00:33.880 --> 00:35.600
is gone.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.200
And all because
of some insipid little...

00:38.240 --> 00:39.400
- Steady on.
- ...heiress,

00:39.440 --> 00:40.640
who you're not in love with.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.560
I know. I can see it.
I can hear it.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.960
I can read between the lines.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I know when you're in love,
and this isn't it.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.040
You've sacrificed everything.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.600
You've thrown everything away.
You've destroyed me.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.720
And you're not even
in love with her.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.640
You're ridiculous.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.280
And I'm even more ridiculous

01:03.320 --> 01:05.600
for still being in love
with you.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.760
Well, good heavens,
what a reception!

01:10.800 --> 01:12.280
You do know I could walk
into Halifax

01:12.320 --> 01:13.480
and get spoken to like that?

01:13.520 --> 01:15.400
I needn't cross the Pennines
for it.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.640
- Stop being glib.
- Well,

01:16.680 --> 01:19.280
it's one antidote
to melodrama.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.240
Melod...?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.400
Do you know?
I think I needed to see you

01:23.440 --> 01:25.760
because a part of me
just still thinks

01:25.800 --> 01:27.560
the whole thing
can't really be true.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.080
Has she really moved in
with you at Shibden?

01:40.320 --> 01:43.520
Good Lord,
have you taken oaths with her?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.960
Have you taken the sacrament
with her?

01:47.360 --> 01:48.680
Eight months ago, in York.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.240
I might as well be dead.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.160
Mary,

02:00.200 --> 02:03.480
I waited for you
for nearly 20 years.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.120
I always had to dance
to your tune.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.200
For 20 years.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.760
When I came back
from Hastings -

02:09.800 --> 02:11.240
and I'm not using this as
a stick to beat you with,

02:11.280 --> 02:13.960
I'm merely stating a fact -
you put an end

02:14.000 --> 02:16.120
- to everything.
- I didn't!

02:16.160 --> 02:18.080
It's how I heard it.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.880
It's unequivocally
how I heard it.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.600
- Oh!
- Which is good,

02:21.640 --> 02:22.800
and we should thank God for it.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.560
It's just perhaps
a conversation

02:24.600 --> 02:26.000
we should have had sooner.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.080
Did you really think
I wouldn't move on?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.840
Yes, yes, but...

02:29.880 --> 02:31.280
<i>...her?</i>

02:31.320 --> 02:34.920
What is she, even? I mean,
we all know she's got problems,

02:34.960 --> 02:36.720
but Charlotte Norcliffe says
she isn't ladylike.

02:36.760 --> 02:37.840
Charlotte would never say that.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.080
And Mrs Milne said
if I saw my successor,

02:39.120 --> 02:40.160
I'd be far from flattered.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.200
Oh, I know she did.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.920
"But Miss Lister won't be
without money."

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
I know she did,

02:44.000 --> 02:45.800
because she said it
in Adney's hearing,

02:45.840 --> 02:48.000
knowingly in Adney's hearing,
when we were in Paris.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.120
- Adney?
- But Adney...

02:49.160 --> 02:51.640
Yes, Adney,
being nothing but ladylike...

02:51.680 --> 02:53.000
What does she call you?

02:53.040 --> 02:55.320
...never even named it to me

02:55.360 --> 02:56.800
until nearly three weeks later,

02:56.840 --> 02:58.280
when we were
halfway up Mont Blanc!

02:58.320 --> 03:01.840
And whatever you, or anyone,
thinks about it,

03:01.880 --> 03:04.560
money had nothing to do
with it.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.840
But it is true
that she has 3,000 a year?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.960
Our fortunes, ultimately,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.760
will be about equal.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.320
And between us, we should have
5,000 a year, yes.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.440
You're fooling yourself,
Freddy, no-one else.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.120
Your little Martha Booth

04:20.160 --> 04:22.000
isn't doing very well
in the kitchens.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.160
Really?

04:23.200 --> 04:24.360
Not entirely her fault.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.960
Our new housekeeper, Mrs Duff,
who we're very pleased with,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.560
had to get rid of two cooks
in succession.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.920
So we think she may have been
damaged by their bad example

04:31.960 --> 04:34.040
in the way of laziness
and deceit.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.520
Oh, good Lord.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.600
But then her head
was rather full of novels,

04:37.640 --> 04:40.320
apparently, when she came
to us, which hasn't helped.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.280
Let me speak to this Mrs...

04:43.320 --> 04:44.840
- Duff.
- ...in the morning

04:44.880 --> 04:47.920
and try and get to
the bottom of things.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.520
By all means.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.560
How often are you
and Miss Walker connected?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.640
Well, you asked me
the same question

04:59.680 --> 05:02.040
about me and Charles
all those years ago.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.840
I can't imagine why you think
it's any different

05:03.880 --> 05:04.960
me asking you the same thing.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.080
How much does she know
about you and me?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.880
I told her
all that was necessary.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.800
Does she know of our...

05:18.120 --> 05:19.320
...connection?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.200
Not explicitly, no.
Nor will she.

05:21.240 --> 05:23.000
Nor will anyone, ever.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.360
Not from me.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.680
What if you fell out with her?

05:29.720 --> 05:30.800
I mean, with her...

05:32.280 --> 05:33.320
...problems.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.760
You don't know who she might
just blurt things out to.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.240
Miss Lister.
Ah, Charles.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.480
How was your journey?

05:43.520 --> 05:45.160
- Excellent.
- Good, good.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.440
Well, I've already eaten
and had coffee, so...

05:47.480 --> 05:49.560
Yes. Sorry I couldn't set off
from Halifax

05:49.600 --> 05:51.600
- any sooner than I did.
- Not at all.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.840
A lot of business on hand
at the moment,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.400
one way or another,
in the town and on my estate.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.240
I was just popping in
to say hello. And I dare say

05:58.280 --> 05:59.960
I will see you in the morning
at breakfast.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Perfect.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.520
Mariana.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.800
Charles.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.320
Fergus, Captain, Teddy.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.800
Come on, boys.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.400
Is everything all right?

06:11.440 --> 06:12.800
With him?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.160
We're ecstatic.
The fun never stops.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.360
I don't want to be too late
to bed.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.800
I promised everyone at home
I'd write

06:21.840 --> 06:23.640
to let them know
I arrived safely.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.640
But you take my point,
about Miss Walker?

06:26.680 --> 06:27.880
If she's not all there...

06:30.480 --> 06:33.720
Miss Walker is the soul
of discretion.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.640
She's very nicely particular
on all matters of etiquette,

06:36.680 --> 06:40.120
spoken...and unspoken.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.360
And, you know, if you met her,

06:42.400 --> 06:45.000
if you could just bring
yourself to meet her,

06:45.040 --> 06:48.120
you'd see she's really
very sweet and very kind

06:48.160 --> 06:50.520
and really very, very normal.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
And...

06:53.960 --> 06:55.160
...I'd like to think that,

06:55.200 --> 06:57.240
in the fullness of time...

06:57.280 --> 06:58.840
...the three of us could become

06:58.880 --> 07:03.840
perfectly good, kind friends.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.920
I was perfectly happy.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.840
But she dragged her
all the way to Paris.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.960
I wanted to go.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.520
Then, as soon as the militia
start shooting students,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.800
she's off to the Pyrenees
with the Stuart de Rothesays.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.960
Her poor Aunt Anne's
stuck there on her own.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.160
That wasn't it at all!

07:19.200 --> 07:20.960
She'd never have left me
if she'd thought

07:21.000 --> 07:22.520
the whole thing
was going to erupt.

07:22.560 --> 07:25.320
- It's exactly what she did.
- Are we playing this game?

07:25.360 --> 07:26.880
- Oh, is it me?
- It's you.

07:26.920 --> 07:30.160
You're giving Miss Walker
completely the wrong idea.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.560
She knows Anne would never do
something like that.

07:32.600 --> 07:37.040
I had a letter from her.
"I've left Aunt Anne in Paris,

07:37.080 --> 07:38.120
"and, oh, by the way,

07:38.160 --> 07:39.560
"it's a seething hot-bed
of insurrection."

07:39.600 --> 07:41.320
I did hear the cannons.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.320
I contemplated hiding
under a bed, briefly.

07:43.360 --> 07:44.280
Whose?

07:44.320 --> 07:46.680
But then I realised
that was an overreaction.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.480
We were on the fifth floor.
Nobody was interested in us.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.720
People think I haven't lived,
you know, Miss Walker.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.880
But I have.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.480
Have you told Miss Walker
about tomorrow?

07:55.520 --> 07:57.880
Oh.
Tomorrow, Miss Walker,

07:57.920 --> 07:58.920
my father was thinking

07:58.960 --> 08:00.800
of taking the britzka
over to Cliffe Hill,

08:00.840 --> 08:02.520
to pay a call on your aunt.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.800
Why?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.520
Would you like to come with us?

08:05.560 --> 08:07.400
- I...
- You be careful, Marian.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.480
You know she upset you
last time you were there.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.600
- My aunt? Did she?
- Briefly.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.200
She was just being difficult.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.040
- Because of...?
- Oh, no.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.840
Well, no.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.320
Anyway, Anne suggested it
before she left.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.920
And I don't do everything
she tells me,

08:21.960 --> 08:23.280
but I do agree with her

08:23.320 --> 08:25.040
that we should make
every effort we can

08:25.080 --> 08:27.400
to be on good terms
with our neighbours,

08:27.440 --> 08:29.160
even when...

08:29.200 --> 08:31.800
Well, she's just old,
isn't she?

08:31.840 --> 08:34.200
- And I do wonder...
- Well, I'm old.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.160
It isn't a licence
to be unpleasant.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.920
Whose turn is it now?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.680
- It's yours.
- Is it?

08:42.440 --> 08:44.640
And I agree, but there it is.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.040
And I do wonder

08:46.080 --> 08:47.920
how poor Mary Rawson's
getting on with her.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.600
- I can't fathom that at all.
- Neither can I.

08:50.640 --> 08:53.320
I can't imagine it's anything
other than excruciating

08:53.360 --> 08:54.360
for both of them.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.000
You don't have to come,
Miss Walker.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.480
I know it's awkward.
Anne did explain.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.400
I just didn't want you to think
you hadn't been asked.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.840
Oh.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.000
- Oh!
- Oh...

09:09.120 --> 09:11.360
At least that was yours.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.480
<i>My dearest Adney.</i>

09:14.520 --> 09:17.160
<i>We reached the Roebuck
in Rochdale at 2.38,</i>

09:17.200 --> 09:20.040
<i>changed horses and were off
again in 14 minutes.</i>

09:20.080 --> 09:22.560
<i>We stopped again
at the Manchester Royal Hotel</i>

09:22.600 --> 09:23.720
<i>at 4.20,</i>

09:23.760 --> 09:26.800
<i>and were at Wilmslow
at two minutes past six.</i>

09:26.840 --> 09:28.640
<i>We reached Congleton
at five past eight,</i>

09:28.680 --> 09:30.840
<i>stopped for six minutes,
then arrived here at Lawton</i>

09:30.880 --> 09:32.960
<i>at quarter to nine
by their clocks</i>

09:33.000 --> 09:35.440
<i>and gone nine
by my pocket watch.</i>

09:35.480 --> 09:38.760
<i>I am now happily ensconced
for the night in my own room</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:39.880
<i>with a good fire</i>

09:39.920 --> 09:41.840
<i>and thinking of you</i>

09:41.880 --> 09:44.080
<i>all cosily tucked up
at Shibden.</i>

10:10.600 --> 10:12.520
Will you welcome a visitor?

10:13.640 --> 10:16.000
Or will the door be closed
against me?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.720
You know I'd never do that.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.560
I couldn't sleep.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.400
All I can think about

10:33.440 --> 10:35.320
is what a wretched mess
I'm in here.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
With him.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.720
Oh...

10:40.840 --> 10:42.320
Mary...

10:47.080 --> 10:48.960
How did we end up like this?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.040
How could we let it happen?

10:53.080 --> 10:56.120
Have any two people ever loved
each other more than you and I?

10:57.280 --> 10:59.200
How can it all
have come to this?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.640
My life's over.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.080
Don't say that.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.760
I can't stand it.
It's impossible.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.560
Mary...

11:10.600 --> 11:11.760
We'll always be friends.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.640
Oh...

11:13.680 --> 11:16.960
The heart that's truly loved
never forgets.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.440
If you go home
the day after tomorrow, I'll...

11:21.360 --> 11:24.240
I don't know what I'll do, but...

11:24.280 --> 11:26.480
...you might never see me again.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.080
Mariana, that's...

11:31.640 --> 11:34.760
Mary,
I don't want to hear that.

11:34.800 --> 11:35.920
Mm?

11:40.080 --> 11:42.040
It's very hard

11:42.080 --> 11:43.760
to only be a friend

11:43.800 --> 11:45.840
for one who has been a wife.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
Have faith.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.320
Have hope.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.640
I believe your happiest days
are yet to come.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.520
How?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.800
Because I trust providence.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
Do you still love me?

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Anne?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.880
Do you remember in Leamington?

12:18.960 --> 12:20.480
Before we went up to London,

12:20.520 --> 12:22.040
before you went off
to Copenhagen.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.360
You said to me, you said,

12:24.400 --> 12:26.440
"She was never
one of my grand passions."

12:28.080 --> 12:31.520
It only ever really started
because you were lonely

12:31.560 --> 12:33.200
and she was there.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.800
And I worry that
that won't be enough.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.280
For you.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.520
Don't.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.640
Kiss me.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.240
No.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.040
- Kiss me.
- I can't.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.320
I won't do that to Adney.
She deserves better,

12:59.360 --> 13:02.400
cos she trusts me.
It's why she let me come here.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.040
She won't know.
No-one'll know. Only us.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.320
I took an oath,
and I shan't break it.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.160
I did. For you.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.120
Yes, well...

13:18.560 --> 13:19.560
I can't.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.120
You married for convenience,
for money.

13:24.160 --> 13:25.760
Don't pretend otherwise.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.360
You're wrong, Mary.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.400
I'm happy with my choice.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.880
She touches something
deep inside me.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.920
And the biggest thing of all...

13:39.920 --> 13:41.480
...she's moved in with me.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.160
She committed to me.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.760
She braved the world's opinion
just to be with me.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.160
And I shall respect that
above all things...

13:55.160 --> 13:56.600
...until the day I die.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.200
I'll leave you to your journal.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.160
Your crypt hand.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.200
Whatever it is
you're putting there.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.440
Goodnight.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.640
And I know
she came from a good,

15:13.680 --> 15:15.120
hard-working family
at Shibden.

15:15.160 --> 15:18.080
But there have been
a few incidents

15:18.120 --> 15:20.400
that have indicated
that she's inclined towards

15:20.440 --> 15:23.720
the easiest route
in completing any given task.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.640
And then
she'll make something up

15:26.680 --> 15:29.720
about why she hasn't had time
to make a better job of it.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.920
But you'll find her
with her nose in a book...

15:33.160 --> 15:34.280
...reading.

15:34.320 --> 15:37.280
Novels. Full of ideas.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.320
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

15:39.360 --> 15:42.360
Carelessness and deceit
are two bad faults.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.080
Make it known to her, Mrs Duff,

15:44.120 --> 15:46.640
that she has nothing more
to expect from me at Shibden

15:46.680 --> 15:48.600
if she disappoints you here.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.200
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.360
Thank you, Mrs Duff.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.760
How careless of you, Freddy,

15:58.800 --> 16:00.400
letting a dairy hand
learn her letters.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.200
Did you sleep well?

16:04.400 --> 16:06.280
Yes, very.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.000
You didn't come
and wake me up this morning.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.640
Did you expect me to?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.760
You always come and wake me up.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.840
Seriously?

16:15.880 --> 16:17.600
You thought I'd come to you
this morning?

16:17.640 --> 16:20.560
No, not for...anything...

16:20.600 --> 16:22.560
Just, you know...

16:22.600 --> 16:23.760
What?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.920
Bit of chit-chat.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.640
Before the day starts.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.880
As we always do.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.120
What?

16:30.160 --> 16:33.120
Well,
after last night's rejection,

16:33.160 --> 16:34.880
I didn't think you'd like it.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.840
I'd like us to remain friends.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.920
Good, kind, close friends.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.440
Just not that close.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.760
Where does Martha
get these novels from?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.280
Oh, I don't know.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.000
She probably pilfers
the odd little volume

16:53.040 --> 16:54.280
from the library
and then puts it back

16:54.320 --> 16:55.640
before anyone's noticed.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.880
Charles would never notice.

16:56.920 --> 16:58.720
He only uses the library
to smoke in.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.080
Well, I'll have a word
with her myself

17:01.120 --> 17:02.800
at some point before I leave.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.240
Did you sleep well?

17:08.400 --> 17:09.880
I never sleep well.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.440
I told you that yesterday.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.440
I've been telling you
the same thing in my letters

17:14.480 --> 17:15.840
for months.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.640
Well, what does Steph say
about these dizzy spells?

17:20.680 --> 17:24.320
Oh, that it's some sort
of inner-ear thing,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.160
or that I'm not eating properly.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.640
Which I'm not.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.120
Again, not for months.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.800
It's just...

17:33.840 --> 17:35.720
...when one's low,

17:35.760 --> 17:38.360
it's always hard to resist
that niggling anxiety

17:38.400 --> 17:40.720
that it could be
something worse.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.680
You need fresh air.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.240
I have more fresh air
than I know what to do with.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.200
Fresh air and exercise.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.000
That's your answer
to everything.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.120
Well, there's a good reason
for that.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.320
It works.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.880
It's all been
very unfortunate.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.560
But when did this happen,
Miss Walker?

18:08.600 --> 18:10.360
Just this morning.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.640
Well, she left
just this morning.

18:12.680 --> 18:13.760
It's been brewing for a while.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.800
Oh, no.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.400
And where has Miss Rawson gone?

18:17.440 --> 18:18.440
Back to her parents'?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.040
Back to Mill House.
Yes, back to her parents.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.600
I've said it before
and I should've stuck to it -

18:23.640 --> 18:25.960
young and old don't suit.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.280
Anyway, the good news...

18:29.320 --> 18:30.760
Oh, good news!

18:30.800 --> 18:33.600
...is that Miss Rogers
is coming to be with me.

18:33.640 --> 18:34.960
Miss Rogers?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.040
Oh, yeah, well,
you won't know her.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.320
Miss - soon to be Mrs - Rogers.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.600
Oh, is she...?
That's... Is she...?

18:41.640 --> 18:44.440
Oh, she's a lady
of more senior years,

18:44.480 --> 18:48.200
assuming the brevet "missus"
through seniority of years,

18:48.240 --> 18:50.080
not because she's marrying
someone of the same name,

18:50.120 --> 18:51.360
- no.
- No.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.080
I have met her several times
and, yes,

18:55.120 --> 18:57.720
yes, I think we'll be
better suited.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.160
It was
elderly Mrs Rawson's idea.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.080
She's, erm,

19:03.120 --> 19:06.080
she's very taken up
with your sister, isn't she?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.120
Mrs Rawson.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.840
Oh, yes. Yes.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.120
She's always been fond
of Anne's company.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.240
It's mutual.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.440
Anne's always enjoyed
the company

19:16.480 --> 19:18.920
of more senior ladies.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.800
She says they're so much wiser
than younger ladies.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.040
Of course, she does like
younger ladies as well.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.640
But in a different way. Obviously.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.600
And, er, how is my niece?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.080
Oh, she's very well.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.680
Very well indeed.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.160
Is it a good idea,
Captain Lister, a britzka?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.320
At his age?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.600
Look.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.920
What?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.240
There.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.560
What am I looking at?

20:12.600 --> 20:16.600
In the tan-coloured waistcoat.
That's the Grantham boy.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.240
Good Lord, he's grown.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.120
He has the same build
as Charles.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.760
Good heavens,
he walks like him.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.360
All the other servants know.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.320
How?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.920
Well, apart from the fact
that he looks so like him,

20:30.960 --> 20:33.080
he makes
such a conspicuous fuss of him.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.400
The other day I saw them
laughing together

20:36.440 --> 20:37.920
and then he gave him
a sovereign.

20:37.960 --> 20:40.040
Right in front of Grantham.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.160
He didn't know I'd seen.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.960
I was watching
at an upstairs window.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.320
Secrets and lies.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.000
Isn't life sordid and banal?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.400
It's a good job we get harder
as we get older,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.240
or Lord knows how we'd get
to the end of each day.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.120
I'm sorry.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.880
I wish you could stay longer.

21:06.920 --> 21:08.880
I can't.

21:08.920 --> 21:10.480
I have to attend this meeting

21:10.520 --> 21:12.840
with the shareholders
of the navigation.

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
Listen.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.440
I know it doesn't always
sound like it,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.880
but in my more equitable moments...

21:25.800 --> 21:27.600
...if it really is
what you want...

21:28.840 --> 21:32.160
...if she really does make you
feel settled and content...

21:33.240 --> 21:34.320
...well, then, how can I be

21:34.360 --> 21:35.960
anything other than thankful
for it?

21:38.760 --> 21:41.200
It's just there are
so few things in this world

21:41.240 --> 21:43.640
more important to me
than your happiness.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.800
So if I've been unable
to make you happy,

21:45.840 --> 21:47.920
then should I not rejoice
that there lives one who can?

21:49.000 --> 21:50.320
Mary.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.120
This whole thing...

22:03.080 --> 22:07.080
...need cause no interruption
to our friendship.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.560
No.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.360
No, but, erm...

22:11.800 --> 22:13.480
I think if I did come to stay
with you,

22:13.520 --> 22:14.600
that we would all be...

22:15.720 --> 22:17.520
...pleasant enough
during the day

22:17.560 --> 22:19.440
and we'd all get along
perfectly civilly

22:19.480 --> 22:20.880
with one another, but I...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.360
...don't think I could bear

22:24.400 --> 22:26.440
to see her go off to bed
with you at night.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.760
Well...

22:34.240 --> 22:35.680
...we are where we are.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.920
And it is all your own doing.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.840
There's no other
human influence...

22:42.880 --> 22:44.680
No, stop. Stop saying that.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.840
- ...but yours.
- Stop it.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.840
We're going around in circles.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.520
I just hope
that you don't forget

22:53.560 --> 22:55.040
the nights
that we had together.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.240
I'm not likely to.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.200
Do you remember that night
in Scarborough?

23:07.400 --> 23:08.880
In the thunderstorm.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.840
You made love to me all night.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.720
By the sea.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.880
And the sun came up,

23:15.920 --> 23:18.680
and we hadn't slept all night,
not for a moment.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.400
I think that was the most
blissful few hours of my life.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.840
Scarborough, sadly,

23:35.880 --> 23:39.160
for me, is marred
by other memories, too.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.520
Oh...

23:41.760 --> 23:44.560
You know, one of the things
about Miss Walker is

23:44.600 --> 23:46.600
I never once, not ever,
got the impression

23:46.640 --> 23:49.520
that she was embarrassed
by the way I look.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.840
Well, if she'd seen you
in Scarborough in 1823,

23:51.880 --> 23:53.120
you might have got
a different response.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.360
Not just what I wear,
but my manner,

23:56.400 --> 23:57.680
the way I walk, everything.

23:57.720 --> 23:58.920
I've never once heard her say,

23:58.960 --> 24:00.960
"Oh, why can't you be
more ladylike? "

24:01.000 --> 24:02.880
Do you remember that first time
that you came

24:02.920 --> 24:04.800
to my father's house
in Petergate?

24:04.840 --> 24:07.120
Yes, what was it? 1814.

24:07.160 --> 24:08.760
Oh, good Lord, 20 years ago.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.200
I had to cry myself hoarse

24:11.240 --> 24:14.360
before he'd let you
in the house, you had such a...

24:14.400 --> 24:16.720
...reputation in York.

24:16.760 --> 24:19.240
And I made myself ill,

24:19.280 --> 24:21.960
properly ill,
just so they'd let you in.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.200
I resent the fact
that you always imply

24:24.240 --> 24:25.880
that I just went along
with everything,

24:25.920 --> 24:27.040
that I never defended you,

24:27.080 --> 24:30.880
that I showed no courage,
because it's just not true.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.480
And the way that you imply
that I had any choice

24:33.520 --> 24:34.760
in marrying Charles...

24:34.800 --> 24:37.040
I mean, what young woman
in her right mind

24:37.080 --> 24:38.080
would choose that?

24:38.120 --> 24:39.720
You had a choice.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.920
- You see?
- We always have a choice.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.280
I had no choice!

24:44.320 --> 24:45.680
You could've run away with me.

24:45.720 --> 24:47.600
My family would have
disowned me.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.360
Well, perhaps you should have
disowned them

24:49.400 --> 24:52.640
for shackling you
to that...fat idiot.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.800
We'd have been penniless.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.800
Only until I inherited Shibden.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.120
Which, what, would have been
another ten years?

24:59.160 --> 25:00.360
Could well have been more
for all we...

25:00.400 --> 25:01.880
I would have conquered empires
for you.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.360
I would have made it answer.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.360
We wouldn't have starved,
not even remotely.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.640
But you doubted me.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.560
You always doubted me.

25:13.240 --> 25:16.600
Perhaps if I'd had the benefit
of a few more years,

25:16.640 --> 25:19.360
I'd have been less cowed
by them.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.800
Well...

25:23.800 --> 25:26.480
Certainly, neither of us have
got anything to thank them for.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.680
They...

25:29.280 --> 25:31.840
They treated me abysmally,
your parents.

25:33.640 --> 25:35.520
I didn't think at the time,
but looking back,

25:35.560 --> 25:37.960
they must've been terrified
of you - to make me marry him.

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
Terrified of me?
Good Lord, I was 25.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.920
I even wonder
if they didn't like him

25:43.960 --> 25:45.720
any more than I did.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.520
But he was just there.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.240
Rich, available,
hideous and willing.

26:21.360 --> 26:22.400
Ma'am,

26:22.440 --> 26:24.720
there's a Mr James Ingham downstairs,

26:24.760 --> 26:26.000
asking if you're at home.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.080
Oh.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.360
Is...? Where's...?

26:28.400 --> 26:30.960
Is Miss Marian still out
with Captain Lister?

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000
Yes, ma'am.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.480
Oh, erm...

26:34.520 --> 26:38.440
Er, well, show him
into the drawing room.

26:44.680 --> 26:46.280
Mr Ingham.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.520
Miss Walker.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.480
How...how are you?

26:49.520 --> 26:53.040
Well...enough, I think.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.560
You look well.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.480
I am.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.520
Would you like to sit down?

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
Are you...alone?

27:03.840 --> 27:06.840
Oh, well, Aunt Anne, erm,

27:06.880 --> 27:09.200
Miss Lister,
Miss Marian's Aunt Anne,

27:09.240 --> 27:11.480
is upstairs.
She has ulcers on her...

27:12.800 --> 27:16.440
She's expecting Mr Sunderland,
her doctor,

27:16.480 --> 27:18.920
- at any moment.
- Ah.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.680
And Miss Lister is in Cheshire.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.040
She's gone to spend two nights
with her friend Mrs Lawton,

27:23.080 --> 27:24.640
of Lawton Hall.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.880
So, how long
have you been here?

27:28.920 --> 27:30.680
Since September.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.880
After we returned
from travelling.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.360
Miss Lister and I,
we went to the Alps,

27:35.400 --> 27:36.400
via Paris!

27:36.440 --> 27:40.200
And any number of other
small towns and villages.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.560
It was the most extraordinary
thing I've ever done.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.360
How wonderful.

27:45.400 --> 27:48.680
It was. Oh, it really was.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.640
I-I... I'm trying to paint. Paintings.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.800
From preliminary sketches
I made.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.200
Miss Lister's really clever.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.200
She knows all the best things
to see and to do.

27:58.240 --> 28:01.080
We hope to travel more -
it's one of her passions.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.200
I don't know a lot
about Miss Lister.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.520
I know she's...

28:05.600 --> 28:08.840
Isn't she meant to be, erm,

28:08.880 --> 28:11.240
sort of eccentric?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.560
Yes, I've never found her so.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.200
I've always just found her
to be very clever

28:18.240 --> 28:20.080
and very interesting.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.800
No, you should come by
when she's here and say hello.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.760
Oh, it is nice to see you, James.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.920
Aw.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.600
And my brother got married.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.000
Yes, I think I knew that.

28:30.040 --> 28:32.640
Why weren't you there?
You and Elizabeth.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.120
I don't...

28:35.320 --> 28:37.120
You were in mourning.

28:37.160 --> 28:39.240
It was just after John died.

28:40.440 --> 28:41.760
Was it?

28:41.800 --> 28:43.720
Four years ago,
good heavens.

28:43.760 --> 28:46.200
What a tragedy. Poor fellow.

28:46.240 --> 28:47.480
I am sorry.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.080
I think it was after that I...

28:52.120 --> 28:54.120
I got so low in spirits...

28:54.160 --> 28:56.840
But you do look
very, very happy now.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.600
Oh, well, Miss Lister's been...

29:01.560 --> 29:04.480
...ridiculously kind to me.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.520
Oh.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.640
Well, I had come...

29:12.720 --> 29:14.840
What, James?

29:18.320 --> 29:20.680
People keep telling me
I ought to get married.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.240
Your name was mentioned.

29:30.160 --> 29:31.480
By who?

29:33.440 --> 29:35.600
Your cousin, Mr Priestley.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.520
He visited us in Mirfield
a few weeks ago.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.080
Did he?

29:49.760 --> 29:52.960
It would be a no, I'm afraid.

29:54.440 --> 29:57.360
I'm really very happy
where I am.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.520
What else did my cousin
Mr Priestley say?

30:09.080 --> 30:12.800
That you didn't quite know
what you'd got yourself into...

30:12.840 --> 30:14.160
...here.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.000
I'm really very happy...here.

30:20.560 --> 30:24.280
And my cousin Mr Priestley
needs to understand that.

30:34.960 --> 30:38.240
Look at it.
It's like the Bastille.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.240
Ah, there you are.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.040
There was a letter for you
in the postbag, Miss Lister.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.080
Ah.

30:54.120 --> 30:56.240
I've left it on the table
in the drawing room.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.360
I'm just popping
into the village.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.320
Don't forget we have

31:00.360 --> 31:02.840
the Reverend Ford
and Captain Mainwaring

31:02.880 --> 31:06.680
coming for dinner tonight, Mariana.

31:06.720 --> 31:10.160
Not the most rewarding company,
I'm afraid, Miss Lister.

31:10.200 --> 31:12.560
Mainwaring's a radical,
bit of a firebrand.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
Oh, dear.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.960
And Ford's just the usual sort
of irritating little clergyman

31:17.000 --> 31:18.920
they tend to inflict on us
around here.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.240
So we'll be relying on your
abundant wit and charisma

31:22.280 --> 31:23.720
to keep us entertained.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.640
Fergus, Captain, Teddy,
come on.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.320
Good boys. Hurry up. Yeah!

31:38.280 --> 31:40.200
Is it from her?

31:40.240 --> 31:41.640
Yes.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.120
Can I see the handwriting?

31:46.400 --> 31:48.640
You can read it to me
if you like.

31:52.720 --> 31:53.760
Oh! Good Lord...

31:58.400 --> 32:01.760
"My..." What is it?
"...dearest..."

32:03.320 --> 32:04.880
What does that say?

32:04.920 --> 32:07.000
Anne.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.360
"I..."

32:11.560 --> 32:13.640
Oh, I'm sorry, you're going
to have to read this to me.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.120
"My dearest Anne...

32:21.480 --> 32:24.200
"I hope you arrived safely
and not too late in the evening

32:24.240 --> 32:27.160
"and that you find
all at Lawton well

32:27.200 --> 32:29.040
"and in cheerful spirits."

32:29.080 --> 32:30.600
Aw.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.560
"I hope the weather
was kind to you

32:32.600 --> 32:34.280
"as you crossed the Pennines."

32:34.320 --> 32:35.720
It was.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.240
"It has been rather indifferent here,

32:38.280 --> 32:40.320
"with persistent showers

32:40.360 --> 32:42.560
"which persuaded me
against venturing outdoors

32:42.600 --> 32:43.720
"this afternoon

32:43.760 --> 32:46.000
"for more than five
or six minutes."

32:48.560 --> 32:51.400
'Your aunt suffered
a slight spasm

32:51.440 --> 32:52.880
"just before luncheon today,

32:52.920 --> 32:56.560
"but since Mr Sunderland
is due to visit tomorrow,

32:56.600 --> 33:00.280
"she insisted Marian
not trouble him any sooner."

33:00.320 --> 33:01.880
Mm.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.600
"She was quite low
during the day following this,

33:05.640 --> 33:07.560
"but rallied
towards the evening

33:07.600 --> 33:10.440
"when she played
four rounds of hearts

33:10.480 --> 33:13.800
"in which your father
trumped..."

33:13.840 --> 33:16.160
Trumped? "...triumphed,

33:16.200 --> 33:18.560
"much to his delight.

33:18.600 --> 33:21.240
"I think, on the quiet,
he is as..."

33:22.240 --> 33:25.760
"...competitive as you are."

33:25.800 --> 33:28.480
No, he isn't.

33:28.520 --> 33:33.440
"All else is well here,
and if the rain stay off..."

33:35.480 --> 33:38.200
I think she means
if the rain <i>stays</i> off.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.320
Or if the <i>rains</i> stay off.

33:40.360 --> 33:41.560
Who knows?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.840
"...I shall venture out tomorrow.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.760
"Please remember
to give Mrs Lawton

33:47.800 --> 33:49.560
"my very best regards

33:49.600 --> 33:52.480
"and tell her I look forward
to a time

33:52.520 --> 33:55.240
"when I can welcome her
at Shibden

33:55.280 --> 33:57.520
"in the, I hope,
not too distant future."

33:59.160 --> 34:00.400
Oh.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.560
She writes to you
like a dutiful schoolgirl.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.880
And you
with your towering intellect...

34:20.560 --> 34:22.520
She always surprises me.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.080
When we were travelling
through France,

34:26.120 --> 34:29.680
a lot of it was difficult
and the weather was bad,

34:29.720 --> 34:33.040
and she complained,
and we did fight.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.400
A little.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.480
But when we were
up in the mountains

34:37.520 --> 34:41.040
and we were really
battling with the elements...

34:42.520 --> 34:45.120
...she became so alive.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.320
It was such a delight to see...

34:48.400 --> 34:50.800
...after she'd led
such a sheltered life.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.280
I think there's
a lot more to her

34:55.320 --> 34:58.360
than anyone's yet seen.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.280
Even me.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.440
Well, let's hope
that you're right.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.680
And you say she asked after me?

35:08.720 --> 35:09.880
Mm!

35:09.920 --> 35:12.960
And I think
if you were gracious enough

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
to venture over there and offer
the olive branch again,

35:16.040 --> 35:17.800
you might meet
with a very different reception

35:17.840 --> 35:19.200
to the last.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.600
And how did you get on
with the britzka?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.840
Oh, Aunt, you've...

35:24.880 --> 35:26.640
We've got to stop him.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.840
If Anne had been with him
on that journey today,

35:28.880 --> 35:30.000
she'd have been livid.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.200
May I...?

35:31.240 --> 35:34.280
Would you mind
if I took my tea upstairs,

35:34.320 --> 35:35.600
to my little sitting room?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.800
I'd like to paint a little more
before the light goes.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.520
Yes, yes, of course.
You must do whatever you like.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.000
- No need to ask permission.
- You go up, Miss Walker.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.880
I'll ask Mrs Cordingley
to bring you a tray.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.320
Thank you.

35:49.840 --> 35:54.480
He's bruised his spine.
That's why he's lying down.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.680
He's going to cause himself
a mischief.

35:56.720 --> 36:00.360
Well, I think if he can't learn
a lesson from a bruised spine,

36:00.400 --> 36:03.160
there's very little I can say
to alter the situation.

36:05.560 --> 36:06.720
Is...

36:07.960 --> 36:12.600
Is Miss Walker comfortable
with us, do you think?

36:12.640 --> 36:15.600
I think she's fitting in
very well, don't you?

36:15.640 --> 36:18.280
It's odd of Anne

36:18.320 --> 36:22.400
to leave her alone with us
and go off to Mrs Lawton's.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.560
I don't...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.880
I've never liked Mrs Lawton.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.400
She's used Anne so much
over the years.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.360
And Miss Walker
is so devoted to her,

36:33.400 --> 36:36.440
- and I just...
- I know, I know, I know.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.720
I just hope Miss Walker is...

36:41.520 --> 36:43.160
...enough for her.

36:45.480 --> 36:46.480
Well, then!

36:46.520 --> 36:48.880
Well, no, there are references
in scripture that point

36:48.920 --> 36:50.840
to the origins
of the sign of the cross.

36:50.880 --> 36:51.920
No, no, no,
there really aren't.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.120
Oblique references, perhaps,

36:53.160 --> 36:54.440
but there they are,
for all to see,

36:54.480 --> 36:55.680
if you know how to look.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.160
Tertullian in the year 200
was the first person to say...

36:58.200 --> 36:59.280
Who?

36:59.320 --> 37:00.400
"We wear
our foreheads out

37:00.440 --> 37:01.440
"with the sign of the cross."

37:01.480 --> 37:03.160
Good old Tertullian. Absolutely.

37:03.200 --> 37:06.480
Bear with me,
and consider Ezekiel,

37:06.520 --> 37:09.480
who tells us that
the Lord said unto him,

37:09.520 --> 37:11.440
"Go through the city,
through Jerusalem,

37:11.480 --> 37:13.120
"and set a mark
upon the foreheads

37:13.160 --> 37:15.120
"of the men that sigh
for all the abominations

37:15.160 --> 37:17.120
"that have been done
in the midst thereof."

37:17.160 --> 37:18.440
Well, yes, that's...

37:18.480 --> 37:19.960
- But...
- Revelations.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.320
"They were told not to harm

37:21.360 --> 37:23.040
"the grass of the earth
or any plant or tree,

37:23.080 --> 37:25.000
"but only those people
who did not have

37:25.040 --> 37:26.560
"the seal of God
on their foreheads."

37:26.600 --> 37:28.400
"And then I looked, and behold,

37:28.440 --> 37:32.680
"on Mount Zion stood the Lamb,
and with him 144,000,

37:32.720 --> 37:34.800
"and they had his name,
and his Father's name,

37:34.840 --> 37:36.680
"written on their foreheads.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.560
"Surely, this is
all part and parcel

37:38.600 --> 37:40.160
"of the origins
of the sign of the cross.

37:40.200 --> 37:43.240
"The place on the body,
not just the symbol."

37:54.600 --> 37:56.240
Can I come in for a minute?

38:12.560 --> 38:13.840
That would have been

38:13.880 --> 38:15.960
a very dull evening
without you.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.480
Do you know,
I often think I can trace

38:21.520 --> 38:23.720
all nobility of mind
that I've ever felt

38:23.760 --> 38:25.440
back to your influence.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.840
You're flattering me.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.840
What time has Joseph ordered
your horses tomorrow?

38:30.880 --> 38:33.360
George. 12 noon.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.000
So you can come to church
with me, then, in the morning,

38:35.040 --> 38:36.120
before you leave?

38:36.160 --> 38:37.600
Of course.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.680
And then I could come with you
as far as Middlewich,

38:39.720 --> 38:41.000
if you'd like.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.640
- To keep you company.
- If you'd like to.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.320
I wasn't flattering you.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.920
Well, I was,
but only because it's true.

38:50.960 --> 38:54.280
When I think of
the tawdry day-to-day here,

38:54.320 --> 38:57.080
in contrast,
it's your influence

38:57.120 --> 38:58.720
that I hold on to in here.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.120
It's your image that stops me
giving in to despair.

39:03.160 --> 39:07.240
Mary, you must put your faith
in God.

39:07.280 --> 39:10.040
Yes, I know that. And I do.
And I will.

39:13.960 --> 39:18.520
I didn't tell you everything
this morning about Charles.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.360
And if I don't tell you now,

39:20.400 --> 39:23.440
it's not the sort of thing
you can put in a letter.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.480
He's been...

39:27.760 --> 39:28.800
His niece.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.160
His brother's youngest.

39:32.200 --> 39:35.640
Will... Poor William's sister.
He's been pestering her.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.080
Touching her.

39:37.120 --> 39:39.280
Cornering her and inflicting
himself upon her.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.560
She's 18. Just gone 18.

39:41.600 --> 39:43.520
No.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.360
They live on the other side
of the village.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.040
- No.
- She came to me.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.320
She and her mother,

39:48.360 --> 39:51.720
who I never really got on with,
but it seems, yes,

39:51.760 --> 39:54.480
he's been saying things,
lewd things.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.200
And...

39:57.240 --> 39:58.760
...he's had his tongue
in her mouth.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.800
And we all know
that's the next thing before...

40:00.840 --> 40:01.880
Has he debauched her?

40:01.920 --> 40:02.920
We don't think so, no.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.080
But the poor girl was in tears
and could barely articulate it,

40:05.120 --> 40:06.360
so who knows?

40:06.400 --> 40:07.680
Lord, I hope not.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.520
So I spoke to Charles,
and of course he denies it,

40:11.560 --> 40:14.280
says it's nonsense.
But why would she make that up?

40:14.320 --> 40:18.520
And then
the stupidest thing is

40:18.560 --> 40:22.320
he's talked about
moving her in, here.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.040
- What?
- He's deluded.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.240
Cos he's infatuated with her,
so all common sense

40:26.280 --> 40:28.520
has flown out the window
and he doesn't realise

40:28.560 --> 40:31.480
how blatant and sordid
it all looks to everyone else.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.520
Good God.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.600
So when he said he was going
to the village this morning,

40:34.640 --> 40:35.720
that's where he goes.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.440
You see, she has no father and
now no brother to protect her.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.960
And Charles is the big fish

40:41.000 --> 40:42.440
and thinks
he can do what he likes.

40:42.480 --> 40:46.160
And he <i>can</i> do what he likes,
more or less.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.800
And here I am, his wife.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.720
Redundant and ridiculous.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.280
And trapped here.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.200
Come here.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.480
If he does insist
on bringing the girl here,

41:05.520 --> 41:06.840
in whatever guise,

41:06.880 --> 41:09.280
or if anything comes out
about him and her,

41:09.320 --> 41:10.600
then you must leave.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.400
Immediately.
You must go to Steph.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.480
Or come to me at Shibden.

41:15.640 --> 41:17.040
Good Lord, Mary.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.640
I am...

41:18.680 --> 41:22.080
I am so, so sorry.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.960
It's been so nice
having you here.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.560
You do still love me,
don't you?

41:34.040 --> 41:35.920
You know I do.

41:58.120 --> 41:59.240
Don't.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.800
I-I... I can't.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.280
Why not?

42:05.360 --> 42:08.840
Why not? Can we not have
one last kiss in this life

42:08.880 --> 42:11.040
before we turn to dust?

42:26.840 --> 42:28.120
The King had no right to ask

42:28.160 --> 42:30.560
for Melbourne's resignation
in the first place.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.720
Nonsense. It's within the
constitution. He had every...

42:32.760 --> 42:33.880
No, no, no.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.960
The constitution depends

42:35.000 --> 42:36.680
upon the compliance
of the body politic.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.120
All very well
and good for those in power

42:38.160 --> 42:40.040
when the people had no voice,
but now...

42:40.080 --> 42:42.040
The King has every right

42:42.080 --> 42:45.360
to protect the institutions,
within government,

42:45.400 --> 42:47.080
that offer the country
its stability.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.440
But the country
isn't stable. It isn't stable

42:49.480 --> 42:51.280
precisely because
of those institutions of state

42:51.320 --> 42:52.320
that the working man

42:52.360 --> 42:55.520
now knows don't protect
his interests at all.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.120
The people will roar
in this election, Mr Lawton.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.360
- They will roar.
- Rubbish!

43:31.640 --> 43:35.440
She says the work's too hard
and it doesn't suit her.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.440
Work is hard, Martha.

43:39.480 --> 43:42.280
Whatever station in life
we're born into.

43:42.320 --> 43:44.680
Everyone is met
with challenges.

43:44.720 --> 43:49.600
But it's our duty, all of us,
to accept our allotted tasks,

43:49.640 --> 43:52.160
desirable or otherwise,
and perform them

43:52.200 --> 43:53.760
to the best of our abilities.

43:53.800 --> 43:56.480
She keeps saying
she just wants to go home.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.480
There's no place for you
at Shibden,

43:58.520 --> 43:59.520
if you don't do well here.

43:59.560 --> 44:02.680
All of this crying,

44:02.720 --> 44:05.040
it's a bit too clever
for my liking.

44:05.080 --> 44:06.520
I'm not falling for it.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.080
Someone like you needs
to impress

44:09.120 --> 44:11.720
the people you work for, so you
can take away good references.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.680
If Mrs Lawton was asked for
a reference now,

44:13.720 --> 44:16.560
she'd have to say
you didn't like to work,

44:16.600 --> 44:18.040
complained a lot
and were sulky.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.680
Then where would you be?

44:20.720 --> 44:23.240
What sort of work
would suit you,

44:23.280 --> 44:24.440
do you think, Martha?

44:24.480 --> 44:29.000
Milking cows. Cooking.
Like at home.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.200
Well, the Reverend Mr Wood
in Middlewich is looking

44:31.240 --> 44:32.920
for a kitchen hand.
I'm sure that he'd be...

44:32.960 --> 44:36.440
Well, if not that,
then you must stay here,

44:36.480 --> 44:37.920
promise to work hard,

44:37.960 --> 44:39.640
and endeavour to make
a good impression

44:39.680 --> 44:40.800
on Mrs Duff and Mrs Lawton.

44:40.840 --> 44:43.680
And promise me that, in future,

44:43.720 --> 44:45.960
you will take influence
only from those people

44:46.000 --> 44:48.240
who you know to be
of good character.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.960
And then, when you come home

44:50.000 --> 44:52.280
and visit your father
and your sisters,

44:52.320 --> 44:55.200
and my aunt and my father
and Miss Marian

44:55.240 --> 44:56.440
and me and Miss Walker,

44:56.480 --> 44:59.200
we needn't be ashamed of you.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.600
Go on.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.200
Oh, we'll sort her out.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.120
Are you still coming to church?

45:11.160 --> 45:15.000
Ye that do
truly and earnestly repent you

45:15.040 --> 45:16.480
of your sins

45:16.520 --> 45:20.680
and are in love and charity
of your neighbours

45:20.720 --> 45:22.480
and intend to lead
a new life

45:22.520 --> 45:26.520
following the commandments
of God and walking

45:26.560 --> 45:29.800
from henceforth
in his holy ways,

45:29.840 --> 45:32.360
meekly kneeling on your knees.

46:31.640 --> 46:33.520
I don't know why you're being
so hard on yourself, Fred.

46:33.560 --> 46:35.360
Nothing's changed.

46:35.400 --> 46:38.120
And I haven't slept so well
for months.

46:39.840 --> 46:42.840
Be aware that I show Adney
all my letters.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.440
So be careful what you put.

46:51.680 --> 46:54.120
I'm not the other woman.

46:54.160 --> 46:55.520
She is.

47:04.040 --> 47:06.880
What time do you expect
to arrive back at Shibden?

47:06.920 --> 47:11.440
11. Half past. Hopefully,
no later than midnight.

47:11.480 --> 47:14.920
Well, goodbye, then.

47:14.960 --> 47:17.240
Give my regards to your aunt
and to your father

47:17.280 --> 47:18.280
and to your sister.

47:18.320 --> 47:20.240
And Miss Walker.

47:21.280 --> 47:25.480
Oh, and for Miss Walker,
it's a little something.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.840
It's nothing particular,

47:27.880 --> 47:29.520
just a rather pretty
little pocket book

47:29.560 --> 47:31.080
I saw in Chester
a few weeks ago.

47:34.040 --> 47:35.040
What's the matter?

47:35.080 --> 47:37.920
I don't think
it's quite the thing.

47:39.640 --> 47:42.400
I thought you wanted me
and Miss Walker to be friends.

47:48.240 --> 47:52.400
- Well, safe journey.
- Mm.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.680
Hup, hup!

48:38.200 --> 48:39.920
Oh!

48:39.960 --> 48:42.800
Oh, John... John!
They're here.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.320
Ma'am.

48:57.360 --> 48:58.400
Yes. Hello.

48:58.440 --> 49:01.160
How's our little Martha
getting on at Lawton Hall?

49:01.200 --> 49:02.480
We'll discuss that.

49:02.520 --> 49:03.840
Help your brother
with the carriage.

49:12.440 --> 49:13.560
God.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.760
I missed you.

49:17.800 --> 49:19.200
Have you?

49:19.240 --> 49:22.040
How was Mrs Lawton?

49:22.080 --> 49:23.920
I've astonished myself

49:23.960 --> 49:26.040
with how little
I've thought of her,

49:26.080 --> 49:27.680
either going or returning.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.640
I shan't leave you again.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.200
Would you like some tea,
ma'am?

49:47.240 --> 49:50.480
Tea - splendid! And then bed.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.520
I love you.

51:41.720 --> 51:43.640
13 to 11, carried,

51:43.680 --> 51:46.720
in favour of the new part
of the canal being 50 feet

51:46.760 --> 51:48.800
rather than 60 feet.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.040
For the sake of £2,000...

51:51.080 --> 51:52.760
Say something, madam.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.080
I'm sure they'll listen to you.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.520
May we move on

51:56.560 --> 51:58.360
to the second resolution,
Mr Chairman?

51:58.400 --> 52:00.960
We may. Order.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.160
Order!

52:04.240 --> 52:05.600
The second resolution

52:05.640 --> 52:07.840
is that double
and parallel locks,

52:07.880 --> 52:11.240
to act as side ponds,
be adopted.

52:11.280 --> 52:13.280
Mr Rawdon Briggs?

52:13.320 --> 52:16.680
I would like to propose
an amendment to that

52:16.720 --> 52:19.440
and suggest that single locks,

52:19.480 --> 52:21.520
similar to those
we already have,

52:21.560 --> 52:22.560
be adopted.

52:22.600 --> 52:23.680
I'll second that.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.240
And I'd like to call on Mr Bull

52:27.280 --> 52:30.720
to account for why
he seems determined

52:30.760 --> 52:34.000
to mire us in unnecessary debt
and expense

52:34.040 --> 52:36.320
at such a difficult time.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.760
I have...

52:42.480 --> 52:45.040
I've written answers

52:45.080 --> 52:49.680
to this and other
anticipated objections.

52:49.720 --> 52:53.800
If-if-if anyone would like to, erm...

52:54.880 --> 52:57.360
- Mr Briggs.
- Mr Bull.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.480
Parsimony, Mr Briggs,
is not always economy.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.400
And I fear in this case,

53:12.440 --> 53:14.880
you are advocating
the former and not the latter.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.800
Mr Palmer,

53:18.840 --> 53:21.920
who we've employed
at considerable expense

53:21.960 --> 53:23.320
to draw up this plan,

53:23.360 --> 53:25.000
is a man of great ability
and credit,

53:25.040 --> 53:26.760
and I for one, one who,
by the way,

53:26.800 --> 53:29.120
has read his report,
all of it,

53:29.160 --> 53:30.960
cannot help agreeing with him
that whatever we do

53:31.000 --> 53:33.440
should be done
in the best manner possible,

53:33.480 --> 53:35.680
and that only the quantity
of our work

53:35.720 --> 53:37.360
should be limited by our means,

53:37.400 --> 53:38.640
not the quality.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.120
- Hear, hear.
- Well said.

53:40.160 --> 53:41.760
Well, then, madam,

53:41.800 --> 53:44.440
you'd have us involved
in idiotic expense.

53:44.480 --> 53:47.680
The trade in the town
does not require it,

53:47.720 --> 53:49.120
nor will it ever.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.200
Oh!

53:50.240 --> 53:52.600
Oh, so you mean to limit
the progress of improvement

53:52.640 --> 53:55.560
within the town by hindering
its capacity to transport

53:55.600 --> 53:57.200
the goods it produces?

53:57.240 --> 54:01.280
We all know
what the town is at present.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.320
But who amongst us
dares venture to say

54:03.360 --> 54:06.160
he knows how great
the town may become?

54:08.200 --> 54:11.720
Let's put it to the vote, gentlemen.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.320
And Miss Lister.

54:13.360 --> 54:16.160
Those in favour of double
and parallel locks,

54:16.200 --> 54:19.880
to act as side ponds,
show of hands.

54:24.520 --> 54:26.280
And for single locks?

54:29.040 --> 54:32.640
Double and parallel locks, carried.

54:34.520 --> 54:37.480
According to
the Act of Parliament,

54:37.520 --> 54:39.880
we have a right to ascertain

54:39.920 --> 54:43.880
whether the majority is against
us not just in a show of hands,

54:43.920 --> 54:47.080
but in the number
of shares owned.

54:47.120 --> 54:49.520
Scrutiny! Scrutiny!

54:49.560 --> 54:51.400
The committee will retire

54:51.440 --> 54:54.920
and look at which side has it
by number of shares.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.800
Well said, madam.

55:02.960 --> 55:04.160
Mr Rawson.

55:05.320 --> 55:06.600
Could I ask,

55:06.640 --> 55:08.520
with the election
almost upon us,

55:08.560 --> 55:10.560
on behalf
of Mr Wortley's committee

55:10.600 --> 55:14.040
if we may rely,
as we usually do,

55:14.080 --> 55:17.080
on the support of everyone
at Shibden Hall?

55:17.120 --> 55:18.480
Of course.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.360
Us Blues must stick together,

55:20.400 --> 55:22.600
put our differences aside -

55:22.640 --> 55:24.160
briefly -

55:24.200 --> 55:26.480
in such challenging times.

55:26.520 --> 55:29.840
Good. My brother feels the same

55:29.880 --> 55:32.280
and will be gratified
to hear it.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.520
Mm.

55:33.560 --> 55:34.840
Is this generally the way

55:34.880 --> 55:36.720
with public meetings
in Halifax?

55:36.760 --> 55:37.840
Well, it's not...

55:37.880 --> 55:39.960
We treat a great concern
like a little one,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.280
we prate like a parcel
of children.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.200
Well, thank goodness
you're here.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.360
Oh, I know my being here,
and speaking,

55:48.400 --> 55:49.720
will be talked of, but...

55:52.680 --> 55:54.880
If such be public meetings
in Halifax,

55:54.920 --> 55:57.800
I can see there is a sad want
for some mastermind

55:57.840 --> 55:59.240
to lead the multitude.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.400
Miss Lister, how do you do?
John Abbott.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.760
We meet at last,
and I'm so delighted

56:03.800 --> 56:05.000
to make your acquaintance.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.040
And well said, madam.

56:07.080 --> 56:08.880
Mr Rawson, how d'you do?

56:08.920 --> 56:10.440
Mr Abbott.

56:10.480 --> 56:12.960
Absolutely. Hear, hear.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.440
Why spend £40,000
on an indifferent job

56:16.480 --> 56:18.680
when another £10,000
would secure a good one?

56:25.360 --> 56:26.600
Order.

56:26.640 --> 56:30.640
Can we call the meeting
to order?

56:32.680 --> 56:37.520
For single locks, 176.

56:37.560 --> 56:41.880
And for double locks, 188.

56:41.920 --> 56:47.040
Double and parallel locks,
to act as side ponds, carried.

56:47.080 --> 56:51.960
Well, we'd best move a motion
to empower the committee

56:52.000 --> 56:55.760
to borrow another £60,000
from the government.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.760
Ridiculous. Short-sighted.

56:58.800 --> 57:00.520
You will regret this.

57:00.560 --> 57:04.480
In less than five years,
you will regret this.

57:06.280 --> 57:10.320
Madam. Well done.
Very well done.

57:10.360 --> 57:11.960
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.400
- Well done.
- Thank you.

57:19.760 --> 57:20.800
Miss Lister.

57:21.920 --> 57:22.960
Mr Briggs.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.400
An exciting choice -

57:25.440 --> 57:27.400
to brave public opinion,

57:27.440 --> 57:30.600
attending a meeting like this
at such a volatile time,

57:30.640 --> 57:33.360
with the country on the brink
of civil unrest,

57:33.400 --> 57:35.560
no doubt, come the election.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.240
And you with your...

57:39.320 --> 57:41.080
...unusual arrangement...

57:42.200 --> 57:44.200
...up at Shibden Hall...

57:44.240 --> 57:45.440
...with Miss Walker.

57:45.480 --> 57:46.920
I beg your pardon?

57:52.640 --> 57:54.240
You should be more careful...

57:58.400 --> 58:00.360
...Gentleman Jack.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.760
That's her, that's...
