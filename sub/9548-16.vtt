00:01.400 --> 00:04.400
Jimmy, we finally have
some good news to report.

00:04.400 --> 00:07.800
I'm downtown on the corner
of summerset and geraldi street,

00:07.800 --> 00:11.700
In front of one of the oldest and
ugliest parking garages in the city.

00:11.700 --> 00:15.400
But last month, city council
voted to tear down this eyesore,

00:15.400 --> 00:17.500
And replace it with
a beautiful playground

00:17.500 --> 00:20.400
And park for the children
of this neighborhood.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.700
Uh, hold on, jimmy,
something's happening.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.400
- Somebody's still in the garage?
- Something is happening here.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.500
There may be someone
still inside the garage.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.299
Who's this guy?

00:33.700 --> 00:35.500
What the hell you think you're doing?

00:36.000 --> 00:36.900
I don't know if you heard the news, buddy,

00:36.900 --> 00:38.700
But we gotta tear this whole place down.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.900
- You can't do that.
- I can't do that?

00:40.900 --> 00:42.800
I got two bulldozers outside says i can.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.400
I'm not leaving!

00:44.900 --> 00:45.300
All right, pal, look.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.500
I don't know what your story is, all right?

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
But you're going home.
Where's the key to the lock?

00:52.600 --> 00:53.700
Give it to me.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.800
You gotta be kidding me.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.900
Cheese and crackers, we're
tearing down a parking garage here.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.300
All right, this is a good thing.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.900
All right, we're gonna build
a playground here for the kids.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.600
What's the matter, you don't like kids?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.100
My wife died here.

01:11.800 --> 01:12.900
Right over there.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.300
Her name was trudy.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.300
She died here.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.600
You can't tear it down.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.500
Mr. Monk, mr. Monk? Mr. Monk.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.600
- Natalie, thank god.
- God, are you okay?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.400
You're all over the news.
I couldn't believe it.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.400
They were gonna tear it down.
Look, you gotta help me.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.700
You gotta. Come on.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.400
Hell, no, we won't go!

02:36.600 --> 02:38.000
Hell, no-- Come on.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.500
Mr. Monk, i'm not gonna chant with you.

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
You have to, otherwise the "we"
part doesn't make any sense.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.900
None of this makes any sense.

02:43.900 --> 02:45.500
Why didn't you call me?

02:45.600 --> 02:47.100
You would have tried
to talk me out of it.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.600
All right everybody,
let's just calm down, okay?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.400
Let's just settle down, all right?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.400
Hi. Hello, adrian.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.600
I'm eileen hill.
I'm on the city council.

02:56.900 --> 02:59.300
This parking garage
is slated for demolition.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.600
We voted on it last week.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.800
I know. I was there.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.100
Why can't we just drag this bozo out of here?

03:04.100 --> 03:06.300
Excuse me, do you know who this man is?

03:06.400 --> 03:08.100
This is adrian monk.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.000
He was a decorated police officer,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
Who's been serving this city officially
and unofficially for 20 years.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.100
Well, he sure isn't serving the city today.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.100
Adrian, i understand
you lost your wife here.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.400
Where did it happen?

03:20.400 --> 03:21.600
It was right--

03:21.800 --> 03:23.000
It was right over there.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.700
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:24.900 --> 03:25.900
I really am.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.900
But you can appreciate our situation.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.400
There are hundreds of
children in this community--

03:32.400 --> 03:35.000
Councilwoman, this is a crime scene.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
This is hallowed ground.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.700
Trudy's case is still open.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.900
There could still be clues here.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.100
Something i missed.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.500
If you tear this place down,
they'll be gone forever.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.400
I didn't consider that.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.700
You could be letting a killer go
free for a swing set or a sandbox.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.600
- What's your name?
- Robert.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.200
- Can i call you bob?
- Sure.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.000
- Bob, go home.
- What?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.300
I believe our decision here was premature.

04:05.300 --> 04:07.700
As i recall, our vote was four to three.

04:07.900 --> 04:09.600
And when the margin is that close,

04:09.600 --> 04:11.300
Any member can ask for a second vote.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.800
A second-- A second vote?

04:12.800 --> 04:15.200
Yes, it's called the confirmation vote.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.100
It's called the confirmation vote!

04:17.100 --> 04:18.300
We're gonna tap the brakes on this,

04:18.300 --> 04:20.700
Conduct a public hearing,
and vote on it again.

04:20.700 --> 04:21.700
Fine, it's your call.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.500
Yes, it is.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.900
All right, guys, pack it up, let's go home.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.600
Councilwoman hill, i--

04:28.200 --> 04:29.500
I can't thank you enough.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.400
I'm not making any promises, adrian.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.000
I can't even tell you how i'm going to vote.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.600
But i do appreciate your service to the city,

04:35.600 --> 04:38.900
And i think you deserve
the benefit of the doubt.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.300
See you next week at city hall?

04:40.300 --> 04:41.300
Yes.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.300
Natalie,

04:45.300 --> 04:49.900
I feel this tingling
in my chest and in my face.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.800
Yeah, you're happy, mr. Monk.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.100
I can't believe it. You did it.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.100
I did it.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.500
You just stopped a children's
playground from being built,

04:58.500 --> 05:00.200
And saved a parking garage.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.000
So the system works.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.700
Let's get out of here.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.100
All right, where's the key?

05:05.100 --> 05:06.100
Well, it's not in the sewer.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.100
You don't have to worry about that.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.100
I'm kidding. It's in the sewer.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.900
Looks like a married couple.
(Four days later)

05:20.700 --> 05:22.600
- Some swimmers found them.
- Swimmers?

05:22.600 --> 05:24.100
Yeah, you know, the polar bear club?

05:24.100 --> 05:25.400
They were stabbed.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.800
Two and three times. She got it twice.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.000
Detective monk, are we
keeping you from something?

05:30.200 --> 05:32.400
City council. They're voting again today.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.700
Right, the parking garage thing.
Good luck on that.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.300
Mr. Monk, we have plenty of time.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.400
We should leave early, though.
Just to be safe.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
It's only a ten-Minute drive.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.400
Look, look. You can see it from here.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.100
We should leave early, just to be sure.

05:44.100 --> 05:48.000
Okay, well, they were tourists.
Probably german.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.600
Really? Why do you say that?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.200
Because they were german.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.900
Uh, from berlin.
Mr. And mrs. Erhard helmrich.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.700
Uh, we found their wallets
and passports in their pockets.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.500
I, uh, talked to a clerk at a hotel.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.600
They were staying downtown
at the best western.

06:02.700 --> 06:05.100
He said that they were a pretty quiet couple.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.500
Yeah, they look pretty quiet.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.800
Yeah, but they weren't this quiet.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.400
I mean, before last night.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.100
They were just regular quiet,

06:13.100 --> 06:14.300
Like, when they checked in to the hotel.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.000
Yeah, randy, i know what you mean.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.100
I was trying to be wry.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.000
Oh, sorry, my bad.
Do you want to say it again?

06:22.900 --> 06:24.200
What do you got there, a bracelet?

06:24.400 --> 06:26.000
No, it's not a bracelet.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.100
It's a strap. See, it's torn.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.600
She had a camera. Did you find a camera?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
No.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.600
Then he must have taken it.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.000
He left her jewelry.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.000
This guy had a wallet?
Was there still money in it?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.900
Yeah, dollars and euros.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.700
I'm thinking they were
walking down here last night,

06:45.900 --> 06:48.200
To get a view of the skyline, maybe,

06:49.300 --> 06:51.200
See the moonlight on the water.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.600
They saw something else.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.200
And they got killed for it.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.600
What was it?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.400
Must have been pretty terrible.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.300
Something inhuman.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.900
Something so horrific-- Is that the time?

07:03.900 --> 07:05.600
We gotta go, we gotta go. Natalie!

07:05.600 --> 07:07.500
Wait, we want you to
look at some tire tracks.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.900
Yeah, take some pictures.
Just get a lot of pictures.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.000
We gotta go.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.500
Come on!

07:17.100 --> 07:19.400
All right, so where do they
hold these council meetings?

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
I don't know, we'll have to ask someone.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.200
Adrian monk. And you must be natalie.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.800
Paul crawford. San francisco dispatch.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.400
Yeah, hello, excuse me
for just one second, sir!

07:28.900 --> 07:30.200
So you're a reporter?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.300
I am the reporter.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.700
I've been following this story.

07:32.700 --> 07:35.500
I'm thinking about doing a story on
adrian monk and his parking garage.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
"Man versus playground."

07:36.500 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, i can see it now, you'd
make him out to be a monster.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.300
On the contrary, ms. Teeger,
please don't repeat this to anybody,

07:41.300 --> 07:43.100
But, uh, i'm on your side.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.400
Hope you pull it off.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.700
Wow, that's very sympathetic.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.700
Lady, sympathy's got nothing to do with it.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.500
Parking's a bitch in that neighborhood.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.400
Call me.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.000
Mr. Monk.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.200
Okay, it's just upstairs.
We're five minutes early.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.500
- Ooh.
- Oh.

08:00.700 --> 08:02.500
Hello, adrian, natalie.

08:02.500 --> 08:03.600
Hello, harold.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.700
I heard about your little
temper-Tantrum downtown.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.600
It wasn't a temper-Tantrum.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.500
Mm-Hmm, whatever it was,
it apparently worked.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.300
I have today's agenda here,

08:12.300 --> 08:15.200
And it looks like we'll be voting
on your parking garage again.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.000
That's right.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.100
You know, i voted against you last time.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.700
Yes, yes, i know that.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.300
But i've been thinking about it,

08:21.300 --> 08:24.100
And i could be persuaded to change my mind.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.500
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.500
- ????
- How shall i vote?

08:27.500 --> 08:31.400
Aye or nay? Up or down?

08:31.400 --> 08:32.900
Hmm, i don't know.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.799
It all depends on my mood.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.500
And my mood depends on how i feel.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.500
What does that mean?

08:40.700 --> 08:43.000
Your mood depends on how you feel?

08:43.000 --> 08:43.900
You know what it means.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.800
I really, really don't.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.500
Do you have any idea
what he is talking about?

08:47.500 --> 08:48.300
I'm lost.

08:48.300 --> 08:50.500
I'm talking about your new therapist.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.900
The mystery doctor.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.200
The genius you're always raving about.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.200
Who is he? Just tell me his name.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.600
I can't tell you.
It's privileged information.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.000
No, it's not.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.400
What happens in the sessions is privileged.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.200
His name isn't privileged.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.000
People recommend therapists every day.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
Am i right, natalie?

09:08.200 --> 09:10.800
I don't know, harold, i'm just waiting
for the conversation to be over.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.200
Okay, fine, fine.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.800
His name...

09:16.100 --> 09:18.000
Is doctor...

09:18.700 --> 09:19.600
Door.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.300
Doctor door?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.600
Is that the best you could do?

09:26.600 --> 09:29.000
I suppose if we were standing
over there by that alarm,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.700
You woulda said doctor bell?

09:31.500 --> 09:34.000
- Oh, god, harold. I'm so sorry!
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

09:34.000 --> 09:36.400
- Sorry, i'm sorry.
- Oh. Oh, no.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.200
You see, the truth is, harold,
i really don't need your vote.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.300
I spoke to councilwoman hill over the weekend,

09:41.300 --> 09:43.200
And she's on my side now.

09:43.200 --> 09:45.200
- She's switching her vote?
- Well, that's right.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.300
So now the vote is four to three in my favor.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.500
And i believe they call that a "majority."

09:53.000 --> 09:56.500
Oh, monk, hey, natalie--
Harold, you're all wet.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.000
You know, the councilwoman, eileen hill,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.500
The one you've been talking about?

10:00.500 --> 10:02.000
Yeah, yeah. Did something happen?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.100
We're not sure.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.700
We just talked to her sister.

10:04.800 --> 10:05.900
She's gone missing.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.500
Councilwoman hill's office,

10:11.500 --> 10:13.000
Can you hold, please?

10:14.300 --> 10:16.900
Councilwoman hill's office,
may i put you on hold?

10:17.000 --> 10:17.900
Hello?

10:18.100 --> 10:19.200
Hello, my name is--

10:19.200 --> 10:20.600
I can't talk to you right now, okay?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.000
The councilwoman is missing.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.100
It's a madhouse in here.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.400
- Thank god it's friday.
- It's not friday.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.300
Who told you that?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.100
- Well, no one told me.
- Councilwoman hill's office,

10:28.100 --> 10:29.500
Can you hold? Hello?

10:31.300 --> 10:32.000
They hung up.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.100
I-- I think you disconnected them.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.300
- Why would i do that?
- I don't know.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.800
I'm natalie teeger, this is adrian monk.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.300
We're working with the police.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.300
We're looking for councilwoman hill.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.400
You should have called first.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.300
I tried. We tried.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.600
- But you kept putting us on hold, and then...
- Councilwoman hill's office,

10:45.600 --> 10:47.700
Hello? Can i help-- Hello?

10:47.900 --> 10:49.200
Hanging up on us.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.100
Look, i already talked to the police.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.500
A sergeant or something.
I don't remember his name.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
He just had a big scar on his face.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.700
Just like yours.

10:57.400 --> 10:59.100
- I don't have a scar.
- Sure, you do.

10:59.100 --> 11:00.800
It's on your cheek. It's right there.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.500
You both do.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.600
I think you have a scratch on your glasses.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.200
Is there someone else here i could talk to?

11:12.600 --> 11:13.700
You could talk to her.

11:14.300 --> 11:16.900
I mean someone who works here.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.500
Well, you could try janet grote.

11:18.500 --> 11:19.700
She's a legislative assistant.

11:19.700 --> 11:21.800
- Thank god. Where is she?
- She's not in.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.400
Here's the thing.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.200
I'm conducting my own investigation.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.100
It's kind of personal.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.200
I need to speak with the councilwoman.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.300
There's a vote that's very important to me,

11:33.300 --> 11:36.100
And they've just postponed
it until next week.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
When was the last time you saw ms. Hill?

11:42.700 --> 11:43.800
Yesterday morning.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.300
She same in for about an hour.

11:45.300 --> 11:47.400
And then she had to leave.
She had an appointment.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.400
Great. With whom?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.900
I don't know. I'd have to check her calendar.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.300
Could you do that, please?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.900
I don't like you.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.100
There it is.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
That's her schedule for the whole week.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.100
Oh, great, can you print
that out for us, please?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.200
How am i supposed to get you a copy?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.100
There's a printer right behind you.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.800
Yeah, there's no print button.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.900
Yeah, it's right here. It says "p-N-T."

12:09.900 --> 12:11.100
- Pint?
- It's abbreviated.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.300
Print, printing, printer. Print.

12:15.100 --> 12:15.900
I'm new here.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.400
Really? I never would have guessed that.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.900
- Are you patronizing me?
- No, i'm insulting you.

12:22.600 --> 12:23.200
Great.

12:23.900 --> 12:24.800
Thank god it's friday.

12:24.800 --> 12:25.900
Take your time.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.400
I hope my water doesn't break.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.500
Chivalry is dead.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.300
I don't like you at all.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.200
So she disappeared.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.900
Her last appointment was
10:30 a.M. With paul crawford.

12:41.900 --> 12:43.000
The reporter.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.500
- Paul crawford.
- Yeah.

13:03.500 --> 13:04.500
Good morning.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.000
I'm captain leland stottlemeyer.
This is lieutenant disher.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
You know adrian monk, natalie teeger.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.600
You're a hard man to find, mr. Crawford.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.300
We were leaving messages at your house.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.400
My apologies, lieutenant.
I was out all night.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
Working on a series of articles
about police corruption.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.700
Confidential, hush-Hush. You understand.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.500
Yeah, i look forward to not reading that.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.800
- Nice car.
- Yes, it is.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.400
All it takes is hard work,
a modicum of natural talent,

13:27.400 --> 13:29.200
And marrying a billionaire's only daughter.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.100
And i'm late as usual.
Can we walk and talk?

13:31.100 --> 13:32.000
Sure.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.700
What about your crusade, mr. Monk?

13:33.700 --> 13:34.600
How did the vote go?

13:34.600 --> 13:35.900
Well, actually, there was no vote.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.300
It's been postponed.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.600
That why you're here?

13:38.600 --> 13:43.100
In a way. Councilwoman hill
has officially disappeared.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.400
She's missing?

13:45.500 --> 13:46.800
Since monday.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.700
Did you check her apartment?

13:48.700 --> 13:50.400
I think she lived with her sister.

13:50.700 --> 13:51.700
We were there last night.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.100
There were no signs of a
struggle, nothing unusual.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.100
What about her car?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.300
It was parked out front,

13:56.300 --> 13:58.000
But her wallet and her keys were gone.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.300
Not a good sign, is it?

13:59.300 --> 14:00.300
No, sir, it's not.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.800
According to her schedule, uh,
she was with you monday morning.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.800
That's true; eileen met
me here at the office.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.900
I have known eileen for years.

14:05.900 --> 14:08.600
She read an article of mine,
and, uh, had a few questions.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.200
- Did she seem depressed?
- No.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.200
Had she been drinking?

14:11.200 --> 14:12.700
No, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.300
What was the article about?

14:14.300 --> 14:15.400
The one she was interested in?

14:15.400 --> 14:17.500
It was about the food industry.
Hot dog vendors.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.400
I read that. I haven't had a hot dog since.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.000
Oh, god, the pictures.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
I take that as a compliment.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.500
That's actually a talent of mine.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.400
I can take almost anything as a compliment.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.300
Eileen read the article too.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.500
Became sort of a pet project of hers.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.000
She said that she wanted
to shut all the vendors down.

14:33.200 --> 14:36.000
In fact, she said she was meeting
a man named george gianopolous.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.900
The hot dog czar?

14:36.900 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, when she left, she said
that's where she was going.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.200
- Anything else?
- No, sir, that's it.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.000
If we need anything, we'll call you.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.300
Look forward to it.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.900
Oh, god.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.600
You missed a couple.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.900
- I was buried alive once.
- Yeah, i remember.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.700
I was in a box.

15:15.800 --> 15:18.800
I was underground for three hours.

15:19.100 --> 15:20.500
And that box is now

15:21.300 --> 15:23.700
The second-Most frightening
place i've ever been.

15:23.700 --> 15:24.600
Hey!

15:25.600 --> 15:28.100
- Can i help you?
- Yeah, are you mr. Gianopolous?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.000
You health inspectors?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.100
Homicide.

15:31.100 --> 15:35.900
Oh! Hey! It's okay,
they're only from homicide!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.300
You scared the bejeezus out of me.

15:38.300 --> 15:40.100
Are you the, uh, hot dog czar?

15:40.400 --> 15:44.000
My father was frankie gianopolous.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.700
And he was the original czar.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.400
And i was the-- The duke of dogs.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.600
And then, when he passed away--

15:51.900 --> 15:52.600
Oh.

15:55.000 --> 15:55.900
Hold on.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.900
Oh, my god, are you okay?

15:59.400 --> 16:00.100
No.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.000
No, i'm fine.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.600
Oh, boy, i'm fine.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.300
Oh, that happens to me
three or four times a week.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.700
My doctor can't figure it out.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.600
Really? His doctor can't figure it out.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.700
Anyway, when my old man passed,

16:12.700 --> 16:15.100
I inherited his kingdom, so to speak.

16:15.100 --> 16:15.900
You hungry?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.500
Yeah, yeah, sure, i'll
take one. I love hot dogs.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, take all you want.

16:20.700 --> 16:22.500
We take care of our friends in blue,

16:22.500 --> 16:24.000
And they take care of us.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.000
Boy, that's good.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.600
What is that, beef or pork?

16:27.900 --> 16:29.500
We use "meat."

16:29.500 --> 16:31.000
Why do you say it like that?

16:31.000 --> 16:34.200
Uh, we are required by law
to put it in quotes.

16:34.200 --> 16:34.900
Yeah.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.500
Mr. Dog-- Mr. Dog czar,

16:38.700 --> 16:40.900
We're looking for councilwoman eileen hill.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.100
She's been missing for two days.

16:43.100 --> 16:45.200
I heard about that. It was on the news.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.800
I can't help you.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
When was the last time you saw her?

16:48.900 --> 16:51.500
Oh, it was, like,
three weeks ago. A month, uh--

16:54.900 --> 16:55.900
No, they're good.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.500
Uh, she did call me on monday morning

17:00.500 --> 17:03.100
And said she was coming over,
but she never showed up.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.700
Which was fine with me.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.900
You don't like her?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.599
Oh, i wouldn't say that.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.000
I would say i hate her.

17:11.700 --> 17:12.599
Hate.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.200
And every vendor here
feels exactly the same way.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.099
She wants to regulate us to death.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.800
She wants us to wear gloves.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.300
- And to put lids on the condiment trays.
- Lids!

17:21.300 --> 17:23.900
And to change the water
in the pots every other day.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.500
And what's wrong with that?

17:25.500 --> 17:27.500
These dogs are like a fine wine.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.800
They need to simmer.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.600
The simmering. That's the secret.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.400
Yeah, the simmering.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.200
See, the "meat" has to simmer.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.900
Anyway, yeah, she never called to cancel.

17:38.900 --> 17:41.700
She never showed up.
That's all i know.

17:41.700 --> 17:44.900
Yeah, maybe she did show up.

17:45.700 --> 17:49.000
And maybe you had an altercation.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.800
And maybe you hit her.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
And maybe you killed her.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.200
Maybe we're gonna have to get a search
warrant and tear this place apart.

17:58.400 --> 18:00.700
You go right ahead and be my guest.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.100
Believe me,

18:03.600 --> 18:06.500
If i did what you are accusing me of,

18:07.100 --> 18:09.700
I wouldn't just leave her body lying around.

18:10.700 --> 18:13.100
She would be somewhere
where no one would find her.

18:15.100 --> 18:16.300
She would be gone.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.800
Have a good day.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.200
You hear what he said?

18:22.700 --> 18:25.400
Yeah, some place we'd never find her.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.000
Mysterious.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.900
Randy, think about it.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.000
Maybe bury her in some park somewhere.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Gah, i could eat a million of these things.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.400
There you are.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.400
Oh, thank god you're here.

18:51.700 --> 18:53.500
- Is that straight?
- Yeah, it is.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.000
- No, the left side?
- No, it's perfect.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.300
- I don't think so.
- It's perfection.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.000
- Look, i talked to the captain.
- You're blind.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.700
He just looked at the surveillance tapes.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.200
He said eileen hill never
went near that warehouse.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.400
Plus, the hot dog guy
passed a polygraph test.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.500
- Looks like a dead end.
- Yeah, it probably is.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.600
He'll still have to answer to god

19:08.600 --> 19:11.300
For that "meat" he's been serving, though.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.600
Maybe the pole is crooked.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.800
How many of these did you make?

19:14.800 --> 19:15.600
1,000.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.000
And how many have you put up?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.200
Uh, including this one,

19:19.800 --> 19:21.400
One. This'll be one.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.200
You're offering a reward?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.300
Look, i--

19:24.600 --> 19:26.300
I have to find her.

19:26.300 --> 19:28.500
There's gonna be
another vote in two days.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
I can't win without her.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.100
And you want to make sure she's safe.

19:32.100 --> 19:35.000
- What?
- And you want to make sure she's safe.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.100
Yeah-- Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:37.300 --> 19:38.300
That too, yep.

19:38.300 --> 19:40.700
Okay, that's-- That's good enough.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.200
Let's go. Let's go, let's move on.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.300
We're moving on.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.600
God, if they tear down that parking garage,

19:50.600 --> 19:52.400
I don't know what i'd do.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.700
Don't worry, mr. Monk.
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:54.700 --> 19:57.900
She's out there somewhere.
Just keep looking.

19:57.900 --> 19:59.100
We will find her.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.200
So, uh, you want me to put this up?

20:03.200 --> 20:04.900
Maybe in the waiting room.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.200
I think it might upset some of my patients.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.100
A lot of them are paranoid enough.

20:09.100 --> 20:13.600
Well, what if i write "she's
probably okay" on the bottom?

20:14.200 --> 20:15.100
Maybe.

20:15.300 --> 20:17.100
And by "maybe," you mean--

20:17.100 --> 20:20.200
I mean "no." I'm sorry.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Adrian, you've been going back to
that parking garage for 11 years.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.200
- Ever since trudy died.
- That's right.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.800
You're there two--
Maybe three times a month.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.100
The forensics people have
covered every inch of it.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.900
So here's my question.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.100
Do you believe--

20:39.200 --> 20:43.100
I mean, do you really believe,
in your heart of hearts,

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
That there's evidence in that
parking garage you haven't found?

20:55.400 --> 20:56.200
No.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.300
Still, you're determined to save it.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.100
There's a wall on the lower level.

21:03.100 --> 21:04.600
It's a gray wall,

21:05.300 --> 21:09.300
And it says "b-5" in big, red letters.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.800
What about that wall?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.800
It was the last thing that she saw.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.400
I can't live without it.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.500
All right.

21:25.100 --> 21:26.700
Here's what i think.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.500
I think you should let it go.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.800
Let the children have their playground.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.400
- I can't.
- I think you can.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.700
Five years ago, you probably couldn't.

21:38.100 --> 21:40.700
But now, i think you're ready.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.200
I'll never be ready.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.300
That's why i have to find her.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.700
They're going to vote
again tomorrow morning.

21:46.700 --> 21:50.500
Without councilwoman hill,
it's three to three.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.100
The new vote wouldn't count.
They'll tear it down.

21:53.900 --> 21:55.400
You think she was murdered?

21:55.900 --> 21:57.500
It's starting to look like it.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.600
Maybe she ran away.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.900
Maybe she couldn't stand all those meetings.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.700
I served on the city council.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.900
Not here. When i lived in tulsa.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.800
I hated it.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.800
The meetings where interminable.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.300
After a few months,
i stopped going all together.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.800
I used to send my secretary in as my proxy.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.800
Is that legal?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.100
I was in tulsa.

22:23.700 --> 22:24.800
Proxy.

22:24.900 --> 22:29.100
Adrian, you're standing up.
Why don't you sit down?

22:29.300 --> 22:31.000
I think you're a genius.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.800
Okay, you can stand.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.100
I'm gonna put you on hold.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.600
If you get disconnected,
please don't call back.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.600
- Oh, it's you again.
- Yes, it is. It's me.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.000
- Did you find her?
- Not yet.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.500
Actually, i was--
I was looking for ms. Grote.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.500
I told you, she's not in.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.600
- She's still not back?
- No, she's sick.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.100
She has pneumonia.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.700
- She won't be back for two weeks.
- Oh, god.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.900
You're a staff member.

23:03.900 --> 23:06.300
I mean, you're-- You're full-Time, right?

23:06.600 --> 23:07.300
Why?

23:07.300 --> 23:08.900
You can vote at the hearing tomorrow.

23:08.900 --> 23:09.900
You have the authority.

23:09.900 --> 23:10.900
I don't think so.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.700
No, no, no. It's in the bylaws.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.000
Look.

23:15.300 --> 23:19.300
"If a council member is absent
or incapacitated for any reason,

23:19.300 --> 23:22.600
"Any member of his or her staff-- "

23:45.300 --> 23:47.700
It's maria, isn't it?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.200
These are for you.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.200
Why were you asking about janet?

24:05.400 --> 24:06.200
I--

24:06.900 --> 24:08.900
I just wanted to make sure she wasn't here.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.700
'Cause i didn't want her
to, you know, get jealous.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.100
Are you interested...

24:16.000 --> 24:17.500
In politics?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.000
No.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.500
Hmm, fascinating.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.600
I like the way you think.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.200
Are you, um--

24:27.800 --> 24:29.300
Are you, uh, busy for lunch,

24:29.300 --> 24:31.800
Or do you have a modeling job?

24:31.800 --> 24:34.300
- I'm married.
- Yeah, no, i know, i know.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.900
Strictly business.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.000
There's a big vote tomorrow,

24:38.000 --> 24:40.700
And i just want you to hear my side of it.

24:41.700 --> 24:43.100
I only get 15 minutes,

24:43.100 --> 24:45.100
So i usually just grab a hot dog.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.900
Great, perfect.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.600
Hot dog.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.000
And some sauerkraut.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.300
Not too much.

25:01.800 --> 25:02.700
That's too much.

25:04.000 --> 25:04.900
A little more.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.100
Thank you.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.100
You're not hungry?

25:11.100 --> 25:15.200
No-- Uh, no, i'm fine. I ate yesterday.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.500
Three dollars.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.300
Oh, uh, let me get that.
It's no problem.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.000
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

25:38.500 --> 25:41.700
It was a "pleasure" seeing you again.

25:42.900 --> 25:45.700
I mean, a real "pleasure."

25:45.700 --> 25:49.000
- The "pleasure" is all mine.
- All right, i get it.

25:52.200 --> 25:55.500
So, maria, how you holding up?

25:55.800 --> 25:57.300
Oh, it's crazy up there.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.400
Reporters keep calling. And detectives.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.000
You don't have any clues
or leads or anything?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.300
Not yet.

26:06.100 --> 26:09.000
She should have told me she might
be disappearing before she hired me.

26:09.000 --> 26:09.800
Uh-Huh.

26:09.900 --> 26:10.700
It's common courtesy.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.300
She could have put it on the flyer.

26:13.700 --> 26:14.900
There was a flyer?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.000
Yeah, in my lamaze class.
That's how i got the job.

26:17.000 --> 26:17.900
Really?

26:21.800 --> 26:24.300
It was the easiest job interview i ever had.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.300
We talked for, like, five minutes.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.700
Then she gave me a drug test,
and that was it.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.200
Oh, i probably shouldn't
be eating these things.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.000
Yeah.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.000
If you ever meet my kid in, like, 20 years,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.300
- Just don't tell him, okay?
- I promise.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.500
So maria,

26:42.200 --> 26:43.500
What do you think?

26:44.200 --> 26:45.100
About what?

26:45.300 --> 26:48.900
About the parking garage,
where my wife died.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.000
Can you believe they want to tear it down?

26:52.300 --> 26:54.000
Isn't that outrageous?

26:55.000 --> 26:55.900
I guess.

26:56.500 --> 27:00.100
Although, you know, a playground
would be nice, for the kids.

27:00.300 --> 27:04.100
Yeah, but, they don't
really need a playground.

27:04.500 --> 27:07.100
They can play in the parking garage.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.100
It has ramps.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.700
- God, kids love ramps, right?
- That's true.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.300
They can pretend it's
a fort or pirate ship.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.100
They can use their imaginations,

27:19.200 --> 27:22.100
Which, i think we need more of.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.800
- Hmm. Maybe.
- Yeah, so if you agree,

27:26.000 --> 27:29.300
All you have to do is go
to that hearing tomorrow,

27:29.300 --> 27:34.800
And just raise your hand.
Just raise it up, okay?

27:34.900 --> 27:38.900
Cast your vote for imagination.

27:40.600 --> 27:41.600
I don't know.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.200
You want me to represent ms. Hill,

27:44.200 --> 27:45.400
But how do i know what she would do?

27:45.400 --> 27:46.900
She told me.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.200
We talked all about this.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.300
She's on my side.

27:50.300 --> 27:52.100
Well, she never said anything to me.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.400
I just wish we could find her journals.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.600
She used to write down
all her notes in a journal.

27:56.600 --> 28:00.100
There's no journal.
At least, nobody's found it.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.400
Did you check her apartment?

28:01.400 --> 28:04.000
Yes, we've been there all week.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.500
What about her other apartment?

28:05.900 --> 28:06.800
She has two.

28:14.300 --> 28:18.000
I can't believe the receptionist
knew about this place the whole time.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.500
I know. She even had a key.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.000
Why wouldn't she tell anybody?

28:22.000 --> 28:23.700
Because nobody asked!

28:23.700 --> 28:26.500
I'm telling you, natalie,
the woman is so stupid,

28:26.500 --> 28:28.400
It hurts me to talk to her.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.500
Physically hurts me.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.900
Do you see a journal anywhere?
She supposedly kept a journal.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.200
Huh.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.700
Looks like she had some roommates.

28:42.700 --> 28:44.200
A cheerleader,

28:45.600 --> 28:47.100
A french maid.

28:49.000 --> 28:49.700
Wait.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.300
Oh, you know what?

28:51.500 --> 28:52.900
They weren't roommates, natalie.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.900
This is a love nest.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.400
- That's what it is.
- You think?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.800
This is one of those love
nests that you read about.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.000
Yeah, but for who? That's the question.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.300
Who was she meeting?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
Oh, my god!

29:07.600 --> 29:08.400
What? What is it?

29:08.400 --> 29:09.800
Nothing. It's nothing.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.100
Mr. Monk,

29:11.600 --> 29:14.100
Don't open that drawer, you understand?

29:14.200 --> 29:16.300
Whatever happens, whatever you do,

29:17.000 --> 29:18.800
Don't ever, ever, ever...

29:20.000 --> 29:23.700
Ever... ever, ever, ever, ever,

29:23.700 --> 29:27.100
Ever, ever, ever, ever open that drawer!

29:27.100 --> 29:29.500
What if there's a clue in there?
What if it could solve the case?

29:29.500 --> 29:31.600
- I don't care!
- Okay, i won't.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.900
All righty. The plot thickens.

29:37.900 --> 29:38.800
Now what?

29:39.500 --> 29:40.800
She was pregnant.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.800
Is it-- Is it her?

30:04.900 --> 30:07.200
Yeah, it's definitely the councilwoman.

30:07.300 --> 30:08.600
Her family just i.D.Ed the body.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.300
Mr. Monk, i'm so sorry.

30:10.300 --> 30:11.300
Yeah, me too.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.900
I know about the zoning thing.
I know you were counting on her.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.800
The m.E. Says she's been in
the bay since monday night,

30:16.800 --> 30:18.500
Probably dumped off
the vinton street pier.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.200
Where those german tourists were killed?

30:20.200 --> 30:21.700
I hate that pier!

30:21.800 --> 30:23.100
So what do we do now?

30:23.500 --> 30:24.800
We do what we do.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.700
Sign on the door says "homicide."

30:26.700 --> 30:27.600
Come on.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.700
So we don't know who,
we don't know where,

30:30.700 --> 30:33.900
We don't know why,
but we do know how.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.600
She was strangled with this.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.300
A very fancy necktie.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.200
- Chalmers of london.
- Yep, very high end.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.700
They don't even sell these in the states.

30:48.800 --> 30:49.700
Let's start here.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.100
Wouldn't it be easier to get some dna

30:51.100 --> 30:52.500
And try  to find the father?

30:53.000 --> 30:54.200
There is no father.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.100
She was pregnant.

30:55.100 --> 30:56.600
Nope, she wasn't.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.600
But we found those pregnancy
tests in her apartment,

30:59.600 --> 31:00.900
And they were all positive.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.300
We told dr. Kay what you had found.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.600
We had him check twice,

31:04.600 --> 31:06.700
And the councilwoman was not pregnant.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.100
Not even close.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.600
Okay, wait, i don't understand.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.400
You know, this was her love nest.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.400
No one else lived there.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.500
Why should she have somebody
else's home pregnancy test?

31:16.500 --> 31:17.500
Is this her handbag?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.900
Yeah, we found that tangled in the rope.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.500
So then,

31:22.100 --> 31:25.300
- This has to be her journal.
- Yep.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.900
Can i get a copy of the contents?

31:26.900 --> 31:27.900
Already done.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.000
This is it. This is all i need.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.300
- A- Ha!
- You solved the case?

31:35.300 --> 31:37.300
What? Oh, no, not that.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.200
Come on, natalie,
we can still make it.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.100
- Where you going?
- City hall.

31:49.500 --> 31:53.700
As you all know,
we lost a dear friend this week.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.600
Eileen hill's body was
discovered earlier this morning.

32:00.300 --> 32:04.300
Let us pray that the san francisco
police catch her killer

32:04.300 --> 32:07.200
And bring him or her to justice.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.700
Or if they don't catch him,

32:14.700 --> 32:18.400
Let us pray that eileen's murder
was the work of a random nut job,

32:18.400 --> 32:21.100
Or frustrated ex-Boyfriend,

32:21.100 --> 32:23.900
And not some kind of a masked vigilante

32:23.900 --> 32:28.400
Who, for some reason, has a personal
vendetta against the city council,

32:28.400 --> 32:30.600
And is determined to slaughter us,

32:31.000 --> 32:32.400
One member at a time,

32:32.400 --> 32:34.800
Picking us off when we least expect it,

32:34.800 --> 32:39.000
Using a different, yet
somehow appropriate method

32:39.000 --> 32:41.600
For each of his grisly killings.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.200
Amen.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.600
So let's get started.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.400
Maria schecter is joining us.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.300
She'll be acting as eileen's proxy.

33:00.800 --> 33:02.700
I see you're well prepared.

33:03.200 --> 33:06.200
Yes, this is her journal,
so i know what she was thinking,

33:06.200 --> 33:08.400
And how she would want me to vote.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.500
Adrian monk even underlined
all the important stuff,

33:11.700 --> 33:13.400
And even made little arrows.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.200
How nice for you.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.600
Well, let's get right to it.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.100
We have some old business.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.200
Resolution 12-B.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.300
We will be voting yet again

33:29.300 --> 33:35.000
On whether to preserve or demolish
the parking garage on summerset avenue.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.600
By a show of hands,

33:36.600 --> 33:40.100
All those in favor of
demolishing the garage,

33:40.100 --> 33:42.500
And replacing it with a beautiful,

33:42.500 --> 33:47.400
Long-Overdue neighborhood
playground and park.

34:01.900 --> 34:02.900
Three.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.700
All those opposed...

34:08.600 --> 34:11.900
To the children's playground.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.199
Democracy in action.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.600
- It's a beautiful thing.
-I'm not sure it's exactly

34:46.600 --> 34:48.699
What the founding fathers had in mind.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.900
I can't believe i won!

34:50.900 --> 34:53.500
I can't remember the
last time i won anything.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.300
Did you see harold's face?

34:55.300 --> 34:56.800
Oh, that was the sweetest part.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.200
There he is, there he is.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.300
Mr. Monk.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.600
Who wants to shake my hand?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.600
I'll shake anybody's hand.

35:04.600 --> 35:08.500
No wipes, no wipes,
limited time offer.

35:08.600 --> 35:09.500
Harold?

35:09.700 --> 35:10.600
No? Paul?

35:10.600 --> 35:12.100
I'll take you up on that.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.000
Congratulations, mr. Monk.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.200
The shrine to your beloved late
trudy's still intact,

35:16.200 --> 35:17.700
And i still have my parking space.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.200
- Yeah.
- All's right with the world.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.700
- Yeah.
- Congratulations, adrian.

35:21.700 --> 35:22.600
Well played.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.800
Thank you, harold.

35:24.800 --> 35:26.300
I feel like celebrating.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.500
How do people celebrate?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.000
They take their friends
to the nearest bar,

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
And buy them some very expensive wine.

35:31.000 --> 35:31.900
There's one across the street.

35:31.900 --> 35:33.900
I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.800
Who's with me? Who's gonna come?

35:35.900 --> 35:36.600
It's my treat.

35:36.600 --> 35:37.900
Wait a minute, who said that?

35:37.900 --> 35:39.200
- Who said that?
- Did i say that?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.200
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry i don't know.

35:41.200 --> 35:42.000
Harold?

35:43.100 --> 35:44.600
- Paul?
- I'll catch up to you.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.300
Great, great. Maria, let's go.

35:46.300 --> 35:47.900
I can't go, obviously.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.100
Ah, i understand.
Well, thanks for everything.

35:50.300 --> 35:52.000
And i'll talk to you later.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.600
You can't drink,

36:04.800 --> 36:06.600
Because you're pregnant.

36:07.000 --> 36:07.900
Duh.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.000
Can i help you?

36:19.200 --> 36:21.400
- You're the guy.
- Pardon me?

36:21.700 --> 36:23.300
You killed the councilwoman.

36:23.300 --> 36:25.400
You were her sex lover.

36:26.800 --> 36:27.700
And you killed her.

36:27.700 --> 36:29.300
Oh, my god.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.800
- Why on earth would i--
- Why? To shut her up.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.300
To save your marriage.

36:34.300 --> 36:37.800
You knew you'd never be able to
explain a pregnant girlfriend.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.900
Pregnant girlfriend?

36:39.800 --> 36:41.700
I read the coroner's report, mr. Monk.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.200
Eileen wasn't pregnant.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.000
That's right.

36:44.200 --> 36:47.400
She wasn't. But you thought she was.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.700
The day she disappeared,

36:48.700 --> 36:51.000
Lieutenant disher asked you
if eileen had been drinking.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.300
Do you rember what she said?

36:52.300 --> 36:53.200
Had she been drinking?

36:53.200 --> 36:54.900
No, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.900
"She wouldn't be drinking now."

36:56.900 --> 36:58.800
Why did you phrase it like that?

36:59.200 --> 37:00.500
Only one reason.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You thought she was pregnant.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.400
You don't like the way i phrased an answer?

37:05.900 --> 37:07.000
What kind of evidence is that?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.100
Actually,

37:08.800 --> 37:12.800
The key piece of evidence was
right in front of me the whole time.

37:13.300 --> 37:14.300
It was her.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.000
Me? What?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't know how i could've missed it.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.200
Eileen hill was a well-Educated
professional woman.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.700
She was an adult.

37:22.900 --> 37:25.400
This woman, on the other hand, is a dolt.

37:25.500 --> 37:27.900
Adult, dolt. Adult, dolt.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.100
- Adult, dolt, adult dolt--
- Mr. Monk, she's right here.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.600
She knows she's an idiot.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.200
She can't even answer a phone.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.600
Have you ever tried talking to her?

37:33.600 --> 37:34.600
It's torture.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.800
Question, why would eileen hill
hire a moron like that?

37:38.800 --> 37:41.600
The answer is simple and heart breaking.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.900
To convince you that she was pregnant.

37:43.900 --> 37:47.200
To manipulate you,
to get you to leave your wife.

37:47.300 --> 37:51.300
She need to have a home
pregnancy test come out positive.

37:51.300 --> 37:54.900
And for that, she need pregnant urine.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.300
Pregnant urine?

37:58.300 --> 38:01.600
That's why she advertised in a lamaze class.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.800
She need to hire a pregnant woman,

38:03.900 --> 38:06.200
So she could give her a drug test.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.700
It was all about the drug test.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.600
It's the only possible
reason why eileen hill--

38:13.600 --> 38:16.000
Or anyone-- Would hire this person.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.200
He doesn't mean it.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.900
Of course, you did have some trouble

38:18.900 --> 38:20.700
When you were dumping the body.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.400
???

38:23.800 --> 38:25.400
?????

38:26.100 --> 38:28.500
But there were two couple
tourists on the pier(???).

38:29.400 --> 38:32.300
Did they see you?
Did they take a picture?

38:34.200 --> 38:37.000
You probably weren't sure,
but you couldn't take a chance.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.700
Still waiting for some proof, mr. Monk.

38:43.000 --> 38:43.900
Real evidence.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.800
You mean, like this?

38:51.200 --> 38:52.500
Chalmers of london.

38:52.800 --> 38:55.700
Imported. Custom made.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.500
Just like the one that was
around eileen hill's neck.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.000
Sheriff.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.000
Mr. Crawford, would you
come with us, please?

39:09.800 --> 39:10.500
Yeah.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.200
Looks like we have two
reasons to celebrate.

39:17.200 --> 39:18.100
Come on.

39:18.500 --> 39:19.900
A dolt?

39:21.100 --> 39:21.900
Sorry?

39:22.000 --> 39:23.300
Is that what you think?

39:23.800 --> 39:26.800
After i came down here and voted for you

39:26.800 --> 39:28.700
And helped save your
stupid parking garage?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.900
You think i'm an idiot?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.600
I-- I-- I didn't say that.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.600
Yes, you did. Like, 20 times.

39:33.700 --> 39:34.900
You said i was a moron,

39:34.900 --> 39:37.600
And that the only reason anyone
would hire me was for my pee.

39:37.600 --> 39:41.200
Okay, maria, i'm sorry. I got excited.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.100
You know, people say things
when they get excited.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.500
I can say things too.
I'm changing my vote.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.100
- What?
- I'm changing my vote.

39:47.100 --> 39:48.300
- What?
- I want the playground,

39:48.300 --> 39:49.500
Not the parking garage.

39:49.500 --> 39:51.000
Okay, wait a second, you can't--

39:51.000 --> 39:53.600
Harold, she can't do that.
It's too late, right?

39:53.600 --> 39:56.000
In point of fact,
it's not too late at all.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.800
This is only a recess.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.100
The meeting hasn't been
officially adjourned.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.300
So the vote isn't final.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.600
- Read the bylaws.
- I read the bylaws.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.100
Well, read them again.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.200
Let's reconvene the meeting.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.000
We're gonna be voting again.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.600
Uh, for the record,
i don't think you're a dolt.

40:16.100 --> 40:16.900
Maria.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.600
Your boss looks pretty depressed.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.200
May i suggest that you
call his new therapist?

40:23.200 --> 40:25.100
- What was his name again?
- Dr. Bell.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.700
Dr. Bell. See you in the waiting room.

40:33.700 --> 40:36.400
- Nice work.
- I'm sorry, i'm sorry.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.100
Okay?

41:38.400 --> 41:42.300
Future site of the trudy monk memorial playground
