00:45.433 --> 00:47.937
Let's, uhm... Let's not have
people come in.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.316
I'd like to do this without
anybody in here.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.844
Could everybody split, that
doesn't have to be here. Thanks.

00:52.854 --> 00:54.907
- Maybe we can keep...
- And close the door.

00:54.908 --> 00:57.582
- Keep people away from the door.
- Is that good?

00:57.602 --> 00:59.145
Yep. Thank you.

01:14.439 --> 01:17.714
"And never have I felt so
deeply at one and the same time"

01:20.099 --> 01:25.697
"so detached from myself
and so present in the world"

01:25.701 --> 01:27.951
French philosopher and writer.

01:45.227 --> 01:47.255
"For Henry"

01:56.918 --> 02:00.136
I wasn't good in school.
I didn't care for school.

02:00.675 --> 02:04.272
Uhm... It was nice socially,
my own experience, but

02:04.292 --> 02:05.600
I kinda just went along...

02:07.170 --> 02:08.668
I started off as a music major.

02:08.678 --> 02:11.106
I was gonna be
a Rock 'n' Roll star.

02:11.146 --> 02:12.705
But that didn't quite work out.

02:13.035 --> 02:14.683
In 1985,

02:15.313 --> 02:17.891
during a hurricane,
hurricane Gloria,

02:18.550 --> 02:21.627
I was walk... I was taking
a train into the city to work.

02:21.667 --> 02:25.674
I'd gotten to work and I was on
the phone with my brother-in-law,

02:25.874 --> 02:28.871
who had just started teaching,

02:29.142 --> 02:30.950
and he said that he was
off from school.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.367
Now, now, wait a second,

02:32.368 --> 02:34.167
You're off from school
for hurricane

02:34.177 --> 02:37.175
and I'm goin' into the city
to work in an Office building?

02:37.215 --> 02:40.262
"Woa, that's a
pretty good kick, right."

02:41.481 --> 02:45.727
My mom was a teacher and I knew
without a shadow of a doubt

02:45.787 --> 02:48.755
from early childhood that
the one job I would never do

02:48.765 --> 02:50.802
was become a teacher.

02:50.803 --> 02:54.429
Never ever I would take
toll cards on a turnpike.

02:54.430 --> 02:58.357
I'd be a shepard, anything,
rather than become a teacher.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.054
I decided to become a teacher
because I wanted to do

03:02.064 --> 03:03.992
something with my life besides
what I was doing

03:04.002 --> 03:06.740
which was driving a truck,
for a company and,

03:06.750 --> 03:09.537
I decided I wanted to do
a little bit better for myself

03:09.547 --> 03:10.987
so I got into teaching
a little bit.

03:10.988 --> 03:14.633
I went back to school
at the age of 37.

03:14.813 --> 03:16.701
A friend of mine from college...

03:16.702 --> 03:18.650
His aunt was the...

03:18.660 --> 03:20.948
Principle of an all-girls
inner city school

03:20.958 --> 03:24.475
in Newark, New Jersey, and
they were desperate for teachers.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.471
So, I thought "Great,
I can do this for a year",

03:27.472 --> 03:30.820
it'll keep my father from making
me get a job at Prudential,

03:30.870 --> 03:34.957
"and then I'll figure out
what I wanna do."

03:37.614 --> 03:40.113
Well, they called me up
asking me to go to an interview,

03:40.452 --> 03:42.450
and I happened to get an job

03:42.730 --> 03:44.568
in a Junior High school,
in Queens,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.047
and I ended up...

03:47.286 --> 03:51.313
starting it at my...
What's now?... my 30th year.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.397
Most of the teachers here,
at one point...

03:59.746 --> 04:02.104
they believed...,

04:02.794 --> 04:05.541
that they could
make a difference.

04:05.551 --> 04:09.338
You know, I know
how important it is to

04:09.378 --> 04:13.584
have guidance and to have

04:16.841 --> 04:20.619
someone help understand
the complexities

04:20.629 --> 04:22.357
of the world that we live in.

04:22.377 --> 04:27.243
I didn't really have that
growing up.

04:31.579 --> 04:32.258
Producers:

04:50.254 --> 04:55.750
Written by:

04:56.589 --> 05:00.585
Directed by:

05:01.345 --> 05:03.753
I am money.

05:04.392 --> 05:07.350
I change hands
like a dollar bill

05:07.380 --> 05:10.007
that's been robbed by a lamp

05:10.008 --> 05:14.464
when a genie appeared
and cried loudly, with volume.

05:14.844 --> 05:18.021
But the tears were
all for myself.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.029
And that's where it
all went wrong.

05:53.441 --> 05:55.630
Hi, Lupe, Dean Vargas here.

05:55.900 --> 06:00.176
I'm sick and I won't be
coming in today, allright?

06:05.291 --> 06:07.410
Get to the point, Dr. Heart.
I've got a school to run.

06:07.411 --> 06:10.047
The State's score have gone
down in the last three years.

06:10.048 --> 06:11.977
You're not delivering... - Don't pretend
like you don't know the game.

06:11.987 --> 06:14.184
You earmarked my school
as the transfer dome

06:14.194 --> 06:16.281
for the worst kids in
the district.

06:16.282 --> 06:17.982
Well, kids deserve an education,
don't you agree?

06:17.992 --> 06:20.319
I agree you're jerking of
and wasting my time.

06:20.329 --> 06:23.197
- Get to the point, Dr. Heart...
- We need consensus builders.

06:23.327 --> 06:26.424
- New methodology.
- You're corportizing the system.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.222
No, we're cleaning house.

06:29.272 --> 06:32.469
Our superintendent feels that
it's time your stepped down.

06:32.569 --> 06:35.867
Babe, you got some fuckin'
nerve coming into my yard

06:35.877 --> 06:37.465
with the heart fuckin' self.

06:37.475 --> 06:40.963
Carol, there was a time
when you were an educator.

06:41.342 --> 06:44.259
You were very well respected.

06:44.459 --> 06:48.156
Why don't you go out on top?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.626
Oi!

07:00.746 --> 07:03.044
Everybody sit down and shut up,

07:03.103 --> 07:06.101
or I'll start pulling out
the referrals.

07:06.321 --> 07:07.200
Sit!

07:07.510 --> 07:08.729
Sit down!

07:09.378 --> 07:11.457
I am starting the DVD.

07:12.196 --> 07:14.264
I am starting the DVD.

07:39.284 --> 07:41.572
- Barth or Barthes.
- Barth. Mr. Barth.

07:42.027 --> 07:43.484
Mr. Barth Henry.

07:44.359 --> 07:46.897
So you've taken long term
assignments at the.

07:46.898 --> 07:49.104
"Lock and McArthur"?

07:49.105 --> 07:50.524
The Fringe.

07:50.935 --> 07:52.953
Well, that's... That's...

07:53.962 --> 07:57.649
This a month-long assignment,
until I can fill it permanently.

07:57.909 --> 07:59.797
I asked to meet with you
because you come

07:59.807 --> 08:03.994
highly recommended as the
best sub on the call sheet.

08:04.093 --> 08:07.590
That's a somewhat
dubious endorsement.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.788
I agree, Mr. Barth.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.276
You'll find many of your
students functioning

08:12.286 --> 08:13.774
well below grade level.

08:13.775 --> 08:16.433
That's your task to try
and get them caught up.

08:16.453 --> 08:19.330
Teach the Curriculum,
most importantly.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.029
Understood?

08:34.951 --> 08:37.769
- Good morning.
- Good morning

08:38.166 --> 08:39.244
I'm Mr. Barth.

08:39.614 --> 08:42.481
Those of you who haven't
heard, this is English 11 A.

08:42.482 --> 08:43.530
- Yes.
- Yeah.

08:43.530 --> 08:45.359
Listen up, I have one rule.

08:46.262 --> 08:47.070
Just one.

08:48.036 --> 08:50.155
If you don't wish to be here

08:50.605 --> 08:51.804
don't come.

08:51.904 --> 08:53.652
Dude, what does that mean?

08:53.682 --> 08:56.240
It's not dude, it's Mr. Barth.

08:56.350 --> 08:57.859
The S is silent.

08:58.058 --> 09:00.056
- You're fuckin' gay.
- Marcus, shut up!

09:00.066 --> 09:01.825
No, you shut up!

09:01.826 --> 09:04.073
You diet Bitch!

09:07.731 --> 09:08.820
Hey, Marcus.

09:09.799 --> 09:10.718
Guess what.

09:10.838 --> 09:11.936
What?

09:11.937 --> 09:13.086
You're free to leave.

09:13.306 --> 09:15.184
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

09:15.194 --> 09:18.131
- Hiya...
- See you later, man.

09:18.181 --> 09:21.139
What's the fuck? You want me
to go to the Dean's Office?

09:21.140 --> 09:23.377
I don't care where you go.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.086
Everyone pull out
a sheet of paper.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.424
I'd like to assess what your
individual writing skills are.

09:27.544 --> 09:29.122
What if we got no paper?

09:29.142 --> 09:31.821
Okay here is the situation.
You're dead.

09:31.841 --> 09:34.768
Alright, write an brief
but detailed essay about...

09:34.778 --> 09:37.216
Hey jackass! I asked you
a fucking question!

09:37.217 --> 09:40.263
About what a friend or a parent

09:40.313 --> 09:43.321
might say about you
during your funeral. OK?

09:44.110 --> 09:46.488
- You have 30 minutes.
- Oh, shit...

09:48.807 --> 09:51.933
I asked you a motherfuckin'
question, didn't I?

10:00.162 --> 10:01.232
Anything else?

10:01.816 --> 10:06.472
You'd better back the fuck up
before I fuckin' wreck your shit.

10:08.670 --> 10:09.799
That bag,

10:10.068 --> 10:14.344
It doesn't have any feelings.
It's empty.

10:14.345 --> 10:17.783
I don't have any feelings
you can hurt either. OK?

10:18.182 --> 10:20.770
I understand you're angry.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.527
I used to be very
angry too, OK. I get it.

10:24.537 --> 10:27.024
You have no reason to be
angry with me, because

10:27.034 --> 10:30.422
I am one of the few people that's
here trying to give you an opportunity.

10:30.452 --> 10:32.039
Now I am going to ask you,

10:32.040 --> 10:35.768
you just sit down,
and do your best,

10:35.778 --> 10:39.764
and I'll give you a piece
of paper. How's that?

10:44.580 --> 10:47.848
Can I get a fuckin' pen too?

10:48.777 --> 10:52.253
Kids don't have any
attention span. They're bored.

10:52.254 --> 10:56.250
So how are you supposed to
reel them in with classic literature

10:56.380 --> 11:03.585
if they don't believe that you

11:04.194 --> 11:07.261
have something meaningful
to share.

11:11.488 --> 11:14.555
Thank you.

11:17.213 --> 11:20.630
Why did you throw Marcus
out of class but not Jerry?

11:20.640 --> 11:23.228
Well I had to make an
example out of somebody.

11:23.628 --> 11:25.575
You know, Marcus verbally
assaulted you,

11:25.576 --> 11:27.425
and that's not allowed
in my classroom.

11:27.435 --> 11:30.382
And, what they say to me
isn't material.

11:31.221 --> 11:33.240
What's your name?

11:33.290 --> 11:34.359
Meredith.

11:35.068 --> 11:37.346
Nice to meet you, Meredith.

11:37.835 --> 11:41.213
So you really don't care
what the kids say to you?

11:41.223 --> 11:43.441
Perhaps I've gotten used to it.

11:43.561 --> 11:45.110
I wish I could be that strong.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.407
It doesn't take strength,
Meredith. You gotta...

11:48.607 --> 11:53.203
understand that unfortunately
most people lack self-awareness.

11:53.323 --> 11:55.001
You should really keep that
in mind as you had

11:55.011 --> 11:56.970
another transient of
second period.

11:56.980 --> 12:01.046
You'll meet them again
at every age.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.412
- I want to see the Principle!
- That's her, mom.

12:06.482 --> 12:09.400
You're the bitch that expelled
my baby? And for what?

12:09.401 --> 12:12.087
- Excuse me, maybe you'd like...
- Because you can't handle it?

12:12.097 --> 12:13.616
Bitch why are you here?

12:13.626 --> 12:16.423
You wanna be at home everyday.
I don't have time for this bullshit!

12:16.424 --> 12:18.742
- Keep your voice down!
- Why are you here?

12:18.941 --> 12:21.180
Hey mam, clam down.
We'll go talk about this

12:21.190 --> 12:23.877
in the Dean's Office.
I ain't goin' nowhere with you.

12:23.878 --> 12:25.677
Look, miss, I know you're angry

12:25.687 --> 12:28.274
but they won't listen to you,
you need to talk to me.

12:28.564 --> 12:31.362
Racist bitch, I'ma sue
your ass. - Come on, ladies.

12:31.464 --> 12:32.514
This way.

12:33.350 --> 12:35.168
- Ladies.
- What happened?

12:35.308 --> 12:37.417
Bitch, if you gimme
any mo' shit in the class

12:37.427 --> 12:41.663
and I'ma getta my niggas
fuckin' gang rape your ass!

12:54.912 --> 12:59.736
Excuse me. Are you
new here? - It's, first day.

12:59.737 --> 13:02.396
Welcome. That was quite
a scene back there.

13:03.395 --> 13:07.622
I was a little stunned.
But it's actually safe here.

13:07.901 --> 13:11.188
- Sorry, I'm Miss Madison.
- I am Henry, Henry Barth.

13:31.721 --> 13:36.697
Whatever is on my mind,
I say there's a feeling.

13:36.837 --> 13:38.336
I'm truthful to myself.

13:38.835 --> 13:41.803
I am young, and I'm old.

13:41.813 --> 13:44.371
I've been bought
and I've been sold,

13:44.491 --> 13:46.808
so many times.

13:49.467 --> 13:53.134
I am hard to face. I am gone.

13:53.194 --> 13:55.482
I am just like you.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.789
Patricia!

14:02.266 --> 14:05.264
Patricia!

14:22.639 --> 14:24.657
Hello? - Henry, it's Rita,
from the hospital.

14:24.957 --> 14:27.465
He's done it again, you
need to get down here.

14:27.774 --> 14:30.652
Bastards, leave me alone!

14:30.662 --> 14:31.870
Why aren't you handling this?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.151
I can't get him out!

14:33.152 --> 14:36.717
- You come and get him.
- Patricia.

14:40.215 --> 14:42.053
Thanks.

14:43.442 --> 14:45.910
Grandpa, come on.
It's Henry, open the door.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.539
Patricia!

14:47.858 --> 14:49.537
No, it's Henry. It's Henry.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.634
- Who?
- It's Henry.

14:51.635 --> 14:56.151
Grandpa, please, open...
Open the door.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.147
Hi, sweetheart.

15:01.197 --> 15:04.215
I thought you were your mom.

15:05.514 --> 15:06.841
You're dressed okay, there...

15:06.842 --> 15:08.640
Were you going somewhere?

15:08.670 --> 15:10.598
Now I'm goin' to work.

15:10.599 --> 15:13.906
You are tired, OK?

15:14.126 --> 15:18.293
It's very, very late so I need
you to go to sleep, OK?

15:18.642 --> 15:20.931
Lets come to bed.

15:24.418 --> 15:25.936
How're you doin', huh?

15:30.952 --> 15:34.619
Some old people sleep
a lot before they die.

15:35.958 --> 15:39.466
Isn't that silly?

15:57.738 --> 15:58.557
Fuck.

16:01.797 --> 16:03.895
- Everything okay?
- You shut up!

16:04.069 --> 16:04.963
You listen

16:05.613 --> 16:07.967
I know you're just some
under-educated drone

16:07.968 --> 16:10.789
passing the time with
these old dying people.

16:11.039 --> 16:14.487
But I'm paying for his assisted
living, and you're not assisting him.

16:14.526 --> 16:18.183
I told you, take the lock
off of his bathroom door!

16:18.682 --> 16:20.600
You know how he gets
at night and forgets?

16:20.601 --> 16:24.178
So you need to be there for
him, to make him feel safe.

16:24.378 --> 16:25.777
Let me be very clear here!

16:25.827 --> 16:31.222
You stop neglecting his needs
or I'll start fucking with yours!

16:31.223 --> 16:33.271
I will have you fired!

16:33.341 --> 16:36.018
Then it's gonna be your family!

16:36.048 --> 16:37.566
Your children,

16:37.567 --> 16:39.965
are gonna be at risk!

16:40.213 --> 16:41.515
You got it?!

16:41.812 --> 16:42.907
I got it.

16:43.003 --> 16:47.459
Don't you ever make me come
down here again at this hour, OK?

17:37.827 --> 17:39.565
Gimme the fuckin' money!

17:39.615 --> 17:41.814
You heard me!
Gimmme the fuckin' money!

17:42.264 --> 17:44.531
Give me the fucking money now!

17:44.541 --> 17:46.709
You think I like you?
Give me the fucking money!

17:46.759 --> 17:48.758
- You want money?
- Now!

18:31.882 --> 18:33.821
Why are you following me?

18:33.822 --> 18:36.628
I am not. It's late, you should
be home, not to screw men.

18:36.632 --> 18:38.857
What? Are you crazy now?

18:39.236 --> 18:40.924
- What the fuck is your deal, huh?
- Get away from me.

18:40.925 --> 18:43.862
Why did you let that guy
beat the shit out of me?

18:43.912 --> 18:47.159
Huh? You just sat there, like you
were a fuckin lemon or something.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.259
Excuse me, I don't wanna
talk to you.

18:48.269 --> 18:49.227
You think there's something
wrong with that?

18:49.228 --> 18:51.156
Listen, little kid.

18:51.177 --> 18:53.324
I don't know how old you
were when it all went wrong,

18:53.325 --> 18:54.992
but this isn't
the fucking answer, OK?

18:54.993 --> 18:56.102
You'll figure it out,

18:56.112 --> 18:58.850
'cause you're gonne get
really old really quick.

18:58.850 --> 18:59.350
Know that! - Why are you
so mean to me, huh?

18:59.360 --> 19:00.868
You don't think I have feelings?

19:01.148 --> 19:03.446
Do you? Do you have feelings?

19:03.496 --> 19:04.464
Listen, pal!

19:04.465 --> 19:06.054
I mean, between you and me

19:06.274 --> 19:08.942
you look like you've got
more problems than me.

19:09.062 --> 19:10.840
- Oh really?
- Yeah, really!

19:10.990 --> 19:13.338
- So come on, I'll make you better.
- What are you doing? Get off, please.

19:13.357 --> 19:14.436
- Are you flerting with me?
- Nothing,

19:14.446 --> 19:16.256
I'm just offering to hang out,
if you know what I mean.

19:16.266 --> 19:18.183
- I don't wanna hang out with you.
- I don't know. You seem kinda lonely.

19:18.184 --> 19:21.322
Maybe we go back
to your place just relax.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.828
Afraid you'll like it?

19:24.978 --> 19:27.127
I'm afraid you've been
fucked and thrown away

19:27.177 --> 19:29.015
so many times
you've gotten used to it.

19:29.025 --> 19:30.583
Fuck you, man!

19:32.352 --> 19:33.571
Fuck off, queer.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.358
Have a good night, yeah.

19:36.438 --> 19:38.308
Yeah, yeah!
Just walk away? Hey?

19:38.807 --> 19:41.344
Where are you going?

19:56.982 --> 19:59.779
"He just fucks
their shit up, and..."

20:00.069 --> 20:02.387
"The ladies cry for me ..."

20:02.696 --> 20:04.313
"At the funeral"

20:04.415 --> 20:06.893
"'cause I aint around no more,"

20:07.174 --> 20:09.431
"to dicks that split up ..."

20:09.647 --> 20:11.711
"Raw and shit ..."

20:12.279 --> 20:14.766
"And ma boys all gets faded ..."

20:14.767 --> 20:18.793
"pleasin' that skunk shit and fuck."

20:20.073 --> 20:20.882
Toni V.

20:24.859 --> 20:26.997
You know it's funny
I spend a lot of time

20:27.576 --> 20:32.073
trying to not have to deal,
to not really commit.

20:32.492 --> 20:34.151
I am a substitute teacher.

20:34.410 --> 20:36.789
There's no real
responsibility to teach.

20:36.919 --> 20:39.666
The responsibility is
to maintain order,

20:39.676 --> 20:42.664
make sure nobody kills
anybody in your classroom,

20:42.764 --> 20:44.203
and then they get
to the next period.

20:44.213 --> 20:46.121
"She used to be a sweet girl."

20:46.680 --> 20:49.208
"She never seemed
disatisfied with her life."

20:49.209 --> 20:50.767
"And why should she have been?"

20:51.027 --> 20:53.564
"Her mother and I gave her
everything she needed..."

20:54.314 --> 20:56.252
"So why did she
become so angry?"

20:56.602 --> 20:59.479
"So miserable and mean
all of a sudden."

20:59.483 --> 21:00.698
"We don't know."

21:00.699 --> 21:02.957
"Frankly, it doesn't reflect on us."

21:03.546 --> 21:05.234
"We were good parents."

21:06.095 --> 21:08.792
"But still, she repaid us
for all we've done"

21:09.022 --> 21:10.840
"by killing herself."

21:11.820 --> 21:13.837
"Stupid selfish Child."

21:13.838 --> 21:18.085
"Now she'll never
get into Princeton."

21:18.322 --> 21:20.163
No name.

21:25.029 --> 21:26.907
"Hi Lupe, Dean Vargas again."

21:27.237 --> 21:29.286
"I can't do it anymore."

21:29.691 --> 21:32.313
" I ...um I quit!"

21:38.497 --> 21:41.985
Oh, if it isn't
the lovely Dr. Parker.

21:42.814 --> 21:45.211
Would you like a happy
help you through the day?

21:45.311 --> 21:46.200
They're yummy.

21:46.260 --> 21:50.676
I need you to fill in for Dean
Vargas in the second period.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.906
I'm worried about you, Charlie.

21:57.201 --> 22:01.198
I just, er... maybe love
watchin' you leave the room.

22:03.446 --> 22:07.253
Mr. Seaboldt. He maintained
a sense of humor.

22:09.261 --> 22:13.648
I think the sense of humor
is key. I don't posses it.

22:13.914 --> 22:15.430
I mean, I do...

22:15.927 --> 22:18.333
in a tragic sort of way.

22:18.334 --> 22:20.123
Whatcha doin' here, Mr. Sea?

22:20.124 --> 22:22.231
Uhm, filling in for
Dean Vargas.

22:22.301 --> 22:24.130
Vargas is a bitch.

22:24.559 --> 22:27.176
Talk shit, you get
slaped like a bitch.

22:27.276 --> 22:29.225
You're not gonna get me
no detention neither.

22:29.235 --> 22:32.222
I'm gonna un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

22:32.412 --> 22:36.669
Un-shit... No, un-fuck
your shit uptight, motherfucker.

22:36.679 --> 22:40.365
Wow! That is,
I mean, really poetic.

22:40.366 --> 22:42.763
I mean, that's truly...
What, lyrical.

22:42.764 --> 22:44.421
You should take that
on the stage.

22:44.422 --> 22:45.982
I mean that shit sells itself.

22:47.430 --> 22:51.604
Umm, hey who could talk
some of my thought says

22:52.047 --> 22:55.723
I am going to un-fuck your
shit uptight, motherfucker.

22:56.632 --> 22:58.390
I'll tell you what I will do, laddy.

22:58.391 --> 23:00.110
I'll un-fuck your shit uptight.

23:00.559 --> 23:04.646
And un-fuck it right uptight
up your ass, you motherfucker.

23:04.786 --> 23:12.778
I'm going to un-fuck your shit
uptight, you motherfucker!

23:13.358 --> 23:14.903
I'll tell what, um...

23:14.908 --> 23:17.635
Why don't you have a seat,
OK? And then I'll...

23:17.775 --> 23:20.333
I'll back shortly and we'll
discuss your bright future.

23:20.334 --> 23:21.909
Okay, my man?

23:21.912 --> 23:23.800
I mean, my motherfucker.

23:25.828 --> 23:27.137
Okay, Mae West?

23:32.168 --> 23:34.457
Ellen, can I see your nipples?

23:34.492 --> 23:36.332
What? No!

23:37.168 --> 23:38.237
Wrong.

23:38.238 --> 23:39.897
See I... Actually I can.

23:40.326 --> 23:42.784
See, that's the whole point,
you have to wear bra to school.

23:43.203 --> 23:44.762
Look Mr. Seaboldt,
I'm just being me.

23:44.763 --> 23:47.760
I don't tell you how to dress,
so you don't tell me.

23:47.850 --> 23:48.919
Capiche?

23:55.824 --> 23:57.602
Ellen, do you know
what that is?

23:58.181 --> 24:01.719
It's a beautiful picture
of a sunset in Hawaii.

24:02.078 --> 24:03.807
It's rather pretty, isn't it?

24:04.246 --> 24:05.505
Now, Ellen.

24:07.015 --> 24:08.322
Do you know what that is?

24:08.323 --> 24:10.791
That's a vagina
infected with gonorrhea.

24:10.851 --> 24:12.298
That's fucking grose.

24:12.299 --> 24:14.527
Yes very. So, you see,

24:14.528 --> 24:17.284
when you come to school
dressed like that, you give

24:17.285 --> 24:19.083
you give out the wrong signal.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.783
Don't you want people
treat you with respect?

24:20.823 --> 24:21.982
Yo! I get respect.

24:21.992 --> 24:23.880
I don't give it up to
every dick in my face.

24:23.970 --> 24:27.207
Every "dick" in your face.

24:28.336 --> 24:30.555
That's respectful.

24:33.872 --> 24:35.969
Put this on.
Wear that for the rest...

24:35.970 --> 24:39.018
Hey I said wear that
for the rest of the day.

24:39.392 --> 24:40.658
Okay?

24:40.940 --> 24:42.174
Can I go now?

24:43.214 --> 24:45.022
I supposed you can, I mean.

24:46.281 --> 24:48.040
If we're done. Are we done?

24:48.880 --> 24:51.217
- We're done.
- We're done.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.626
Another student saved.

24:56.743 --> 24:58.071
Come out of
the bathroom, grandma!

24:59.450 --> 25:00.820
Come on granma, open the door.

25:04.596 --> 25:05.856
Hi, grandpa.

25:07.784 --> 25:08.583
Grandpa.

25:10.731 --> 25:11.541
Grandpa.

25:12.792 --> 25:13.781
You okay?

25:13.979 --> 25:15.617
What is it, grandpa?

25:15.917 --> 25:17.546
It's Henry, grandpa.

25:18.395 --> 25:19.884
Grandpa, it's Henry.

25:19.944 --> 25:22.440
- Who?
- Are you in pain?

25:22.441 --> 25:25.739
No, no. I... I pissed myself.

25:30.735 --> 25:33.042
Come on, grandma,
open the door!

25:33.348 --> 25:34.261
Excuse me.

25:34.461 --> 25:35.522
Excuse me.

25:36.030 --> 25:38.728
- Can you come in here please?
- We have a little accident?

25:39.167 --> 25:40.907
- Yes.
- You should... haa..

25:44.593 --> 25:49.009
- Do you wanna? - No, no.
- See, we're taking care of it.

25:49.019 --> 25:50.297
See? You're okay.

25:50.298 --> 25:54.515
You right? - Are you doin'
any writing, grandpa?

25:54.715 --> 25:56.004
In journals?

25:56.005 --> 25:58.039
No, my life...

25:58.941 --> 26:02.578
My life isn't worth memoires.

26:03.427 --> 26:05.226
It's ok, it's okay.

26:06.385 --> 26:09.332
I didn't wanna to go
out like this.

26:10.062 --> 26:12.500
I hate being a burden.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.247
You're not a burden.

26:14.248 --> 26:15.575
Okay?

26:15.967 --> 26:17.665
You're not a burden.

26:17.666 --> 26:22.971
Sure. You...
You like coming here, eh?

26:24.270 --> 26:27.568
Your mother came by today.

26:27.668 --> 26:30.285
Have you spoken to her lately?

26:31.664 --> 26:32.873
No.

26:34.742 --> 26:38.558
Now, you tell her I'm fine?

26:40.257 --> 26:44.963
You always say you're fine, but
I know you hide things from me.

26:45.153 --> 26:47.351
You've always been closed off.

26:47.871 --> 26:50.178
Ever since you were a kid.

26:50.430 --> 26:52.023
Why is that?

26:55.088 --> 26:56.617
Why?

26:58.492 --> 27:02.449
Ah, you're upset. I shouldn't
say these things to you...

27:02.499 --> 27:05.945
- I don't mean to make you...
- You haven't upset me, grandpa.

27:05.965 --> 27:09.033
It's that I don't wanna
talk about the past.

27:09.283 --> 27:12.989
You and I remember it
very differently.

27:14.419 --> 27:17.416
Get rest, O.K?
Close your eyes. I'm here.

27:18.035 --> 27:22.931
- I am in here with you.
- When you stop coming, Henry

27:22.951 --> 27:24.850
I'll die.

27:28.267 --> 27:30.345
Fuck.

28:09.753 --> 28:10.792
You got a smoke?

28:11.980 --> 28:14.259
No, I don't have a smoke.

28:14.689 --> 28:16.876
Where did you go, eh?

28:18.676 --> 28:21.233
- What are you gonna do now?
- What are you gonna do, little kid?

28:21.453 --> 28:22.702
I don't know.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.258
Can you lend me ten bucks?

28:27.418 --> 28:30.676
Come on, man I'm hungry.

28:41.707 --> 28:45.733
I may have something
to eat at my place.

28:56.749 --> 28:59.377
Come in, wash your hands.

29:02.029 --> 29:04.906
There's soap over there.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.883
Sit down.

29:23.712 --> 29:26.978
Really nice place you got.

29:36.561 --> 29:38.419
Thanks.

29:42.366 --> 29:45.882
- You got anything stronger?
- Eat your sandwich.

30:07.135 --> 30:09.374
Hey, hold on man!

30:09.394 --> 30:12.371
- It's a 100 bucks.
- Relax...

30:41.287 --> 30:43.195
What?

30:44.595 --> 30:48.750
- Have you been raped recently?
- What do you care?

30:49.010 --> 30:53.007
I'm not sure
that I do particulary.

30:53.107 --> 30:57.134
Find and put something on it.

31:07.744 --> 31:10.613
Look, I gotta get back.

31:10.703 --> 31:11.893
Back?

31:12.221 --> 31:13.330
Back where?

31:14.240 --> 31:15.358
Listen, buddy,

31:15.359 --> 31:18.036
If you don't got the
money it's cool. I mean,

31:18.086 --> 31:19.345
I like you.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.083
I'll blow you for 50?

31:21.084 --> 31:22.132
Listen to me,

31:22.133 --> 31:24.990
knock off the bullsit, okay?

31:27.728 --> 31:29.557
Come in the bathroom.

31:44.914 --> 31:48.131
It's gonna sting a little bit.

31:50.110 --> 31:51.818
Why are you doing this?

31:52.099 --> 31:55.512
Take a shower.

31:56.055 --> 31:58.672
- This is fresh towel.
- Thanks.

32:29.337 --> 32:31.526
Go to sleep.

33:27.471 --> 33:28.579
Hello, this is Dr. Parker.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.975
My son's ADHD and I looked it up
online, and that's what hes' got.

33:31.985 --> 33:33.454
Now you gotta
get im a free laptop.

33:33.753 --> 33:35.511
Mr. Kevin, your son Oliver
injured a student.

33:37.171 --> 33:38.969
His problems are behavioral.

33:38.979 --> 33:41.966
Hey, my kid's got a disability
and he's not learning anything,

33:41.967 --> 33:43.145
and this is your fault!

33:43.146 --> 33:44.914
Hey, hey... What are you doing?

33:45.014 --> 33:47.312
What is the matter with you?

33:47.313 --> 33:49.610
As it is, our resources emaciated.

33:49.630 --> 33:52.628
Now, I heave real LD kids
that need my attention.

33:52.908 --> 33:56.704
He's always mad all the time because
he's not getting the services he needs.

33:56.734 --> 34:00.282
No Child Left Behind
promises me my rights.

34:00.283 --> 34:04.049
You'll be hearing from
my lawyer. - Mr...

34:42.696 --> 34:47.103
Hey, what are you doing?
What is this?

34:51.080 --> 34:55.106
What is this? Funny? Get to
class. Get to class right now.

34:56.514 --> 34:58.853
What's the joke?
I don't get the joke. Huh?

34:58.963 --> 35:01.351
Is this funny? Does that
look good to you?

35:01.391 --> 35:05.248
You like hurting animals? Huh?!
Is that what you like to do?

35:05.298 --> 35:08.385
Answer me! You like hurting
animals? You like this?!

35:08.386 --> 35:11.952
Come here. Go.
Lets go. Come on.

35:12.062 --> 35:14.131
Walk.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.733
Mr. Raymond, the studies
have shown that kids

35:22.743 --> 35:25.282
who are prone to hurting
animals at an early age

35:25.292 --> 35:28.418
eventually fall into a
high percentage of adults

35:28.428 --> 35:32.925
who may fail to develop even
the most basic feeling for people.

35:33.374 --> 35:34.673
Raven.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.362
How do you feel about this?

35:39.538 --> 35:41.131
I feel...

35:41.883 --> 35:43.404
Trapped.

35:43.704 --> 35:45.764
Like the cat.

36:23.204 --> 36:24.024
Fuck.

36:25.225 --> 36:26.726
Who are you? Why?

36:27.479 --> 36:29.328
Did you pay? Did you pay her?

36:29.368 --> 36:32.415
- Yeah alright, here...
- Pay her!

36:32.755 --> 36:36.562
- Alright, here, take...
- What are you paying me for, huh?!

36:36.812 --> 36:38.021
It wasn't in my mouth!

36:39.110 --> 36:41.958
Get fuck out of here.
Get out of here! Fuck!

36:44.196 --> 36:46.293
Don't hurt me!

36:53.893 --> 36:54.692
Here...

36:57.684 --> 36:59.633
Change your sheets!

37:10.354 --> 37:12.762
How do you do it kid?

37:17.378 --> 37:19.946
Please don't be mad at me.

37:20.026 --> 37:21.284
I am not mad at you.

37:21.965 --> 37:24.183
Don't think about leaving me.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.860
I won't do it anymore,
I promise.

37:27.870 --> 37:29.938
You don't need to promise me.

37:32.325 --> 37:34.185
Okay don't promise to me.

37:34.493 --> 37:38.852
Whatever it is, you feel
you need to do, you do it.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.699
But you don't do it here!

37:41.084 --> 37:42.307
Okay?

37:43.673 --> 37:45.364
What are you doing there?

37:45.805 --> 37:47.313
Don't you knock?

37:49.381 --> 37:52.919
What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?

37:53.079 --> 37:56.227
Why don't you paint
something cheerful?

37:56.228 --> 37:58.913
Like happy with colors.

37:58.914 --> 38:01.761
Whadya want from me dad, besides
for me to have been born with a penis.

38:01.762 --> 38:02.934
I don't work all day

38:02.935 --> 38:06.098
to have my night ruined
by your teen angst.

38:10.015 --> 38:14.370
I am not goin' to support you
and your little creative habits!

38:14.481 --> 38:17.418
Okay? I've had it with all
of all your little art projects

38:17.648 --> 38:19.315
that are going nowhere!

38:19.316 --> 38:21.845
You always know
what to say, dad.

38:21.915 --> 38:24.841
Now, if you cleared...

38:24.842 --> 38:27.131
and lost some weight

38:30.537 --> 38:33.795
you could attract
a nice boys, who knows.

38:34.804 --> 38:36.390
There should be

38:37.812 --> 38:39.410
a prerequisite,

38:40.989 --> 38:45.545
curriculum for being an parent,
before the people attempt to.

38:49.632 --> 38:51.141
Don't try this at home.

38:55.097 --> 38:56.656
Take these.

39:02.161 --> 39:03.430
What are those?

39:03.970 --> 39:05.868
You're supposed to ask me
before you take them.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.326
They're vitamins,

39:08.336 --> 39:09.585
and Aspirin.

39:09.686 --> 39:11.316
At some point

39:14.161 --> 39:15.830
you should get an HIV test.

39:18.307 --> 39:19.517
At some point.

39:33.335 --> 39:35.903
Why are you crying on the bus?

39:46.474 --> 39:47.743
Go to sleep.

40:07.174 --> 40:08.262
A friend of yours?

40:08.576 --> 40:09.955
A friend.

40:10.644 --> 40:12.014
Oh... No, no...

40:12.773 --> 40:14.721
He was...

40:15.031 --> 40:16.559
Total asshole.

40:18.079 --> 40:19.707
What was his problem?

40:20.486 --> 40:23.494
He chose a vocation that
did not choose him.

40:23.824 --> 40:25.442
And then he spent his
whole career

40:25.542 --> 40:28.709
"casting pearls before swine",
He talked like that...

40:30.318 --> 40:31.917
The child-hater, basically.

40:32.236 --> 40:37.222
He tried to purge Steinbeck and
Faulkner from required reading list.

40:37.302 --> 40:40.940
Well, let it be said from
the safety of his sabbatical,

40:41.579 --> 40:44.576
You can do no more harm.

40:45.185 --> 40:46.274
How did he die?

40:46.813 --> 40:49.142
Who knows, and who cares.

41:00.484 --> 41:01.561
"Hello."

41:01.562 --> 41:03.580
"It's drudgery, this life"

41:04.069 --> 41:05.676
"and retention"

41:05.779 --> 41:07.946
"suspension, expulsion"

41:07.947 --> 41:09.505
"staff meetings."

41:09.934 --> 41:11.432
"The Papers cuts."

41:11.433 --> 41:12.760
"The vacant parents."

41:12.963 --> 41:14.270
"Their vicious kids."

41:14.271 --> 41:16.239
"Theye're the dreads
of the pain."

41:16.240 --> 41:18.148
"They spat on my soul."

41:18.588 --> 41:20.775
"This humiliation will stop."

41:20.776 --> 41:24.922
"Discipline must be restored,
these kids have us on the run."

41:24.923 --> 41:27.049
" We're the ones on trial!"

41:27.050 --> 41:29.459
" It's fucking madness!"

41:29.789 --> 41:31.676
"Like every child has value?"

41:31.677 --> 41:34.514
"Is aware and worthy of
a private education."

41:34.515 --> 41:37.642
"Fucking kids who have
no desires,"

41:37.852 --> 41:38.950
"no fire..."

41:38.951 --> 41:40.520
"No minds to be..."

42:06.229 --> 42:07.477
" Assimilate."

42:07.577 --> 42:08.937
What does that mean?

42:11.254 --> 42:12.482
To take something in.

42:12.483 --> 42:14.162
OK, excellent. To absorb.

42:14.770 --> 42:17.415
" Ubiquitous."

42:18.275 --> 42:19.951
Anyone?

42:22.685 --> 42:24.373
Everywhere, all the time.

42:24.783 --> 42:27.031
So what...

42:27.211 --> 42:31.057
"ubiquitous assimilation."

42:32.637 --> 42:36.033
Always absorbing everything
everywhere all the time.

42:36.450 --> 42:37.980
Well done, George.

42:38.462 --> 42:40.850
How are you
to imagine anything,

42:41.239 --> 42:43.728
if the images are always
provided for you?

42:44.827 --> 42:47.904
Who here had read
"1984" last year?

42:48.323 --> 42:49.373
Good.

42:54.596 --> 42:55.877
Anyone?

42:56.477 --> 42:57.766
Meredith.

42:57.916 --> 43:01.262
Having two opposing
beliefs at once.

43:01.263 --> 43:02.941
Believing that both are true.

43:03.141 --> 43:04.410
Excellent.

43:04.820 --> 43:07.428
Why do you always suck
his dick, you fuckin' kiss-ass?

43:07.628 --> 43:11.134
To deliberately believe in lies

43:11.454 --> 43:14.092
while knowning they're false.

43:16.550 --> 43:18.669
Examples of this
in everyday life:

43:19.108 --> 43:20.417
Oh, I,

43:21.606 --> 43:24.264
need to be pretty to be happy.

43:25.743 --> 43:28.290
I need surgery to be pretty.

43:29.187 --> 43:31.397
I need to be thin.

43:31.398 --> 43:32.772
Famous.

43:32.773 --> 43:34.237
Fashionable.

43:35.504 --> 43:37.163
Our young men,

43:38.382 --> 43:39.980
today,

43:40.500 --> 43:42.578
are being told that women

43:42.579 --> 43:44.056
are whores;

43:44.057 --> 43:46.375
Bitches, things to be screwed,

43:48.414 --> 43:49.813
beaten,

43:50.582 --> 43:52.100
shit on,

43:52.850 --> 43:54.439
ashamed.

43:55.448 --> 43:58.335
This is a marketing holocaust.

43:58.954 --> 44:00.244
24 hours a day,

44:00.953 --> 44:02.202
for the rest of our lives,

44:02.941 --> 44:04.620
the powers that be

44:04.720 --> 44:05.700
are hard at work

44:06.389 --> 44:07.438
dumbing us

44:07.927 --> 44:09.806
to death.

44:10.646 --> 44:13.278
So, to defend ourselves

44:14.002 --> 44:19.508
and fight against assimilating this
dullness into our thought processes,

44:19.867 --> 44:21.536
we must learn to read

44:21.835 --> 44:24.074
to stimulate our own imagination;

44:24.334 --> 44:25.533
To cultivate

44:25.852 --> 44:28.530
our own consciousness,

44:28.731 --> 44:31.358
our own belief system.

44:32.118 --> 44:33.805
We all need these skills

44:33.806 --> 44:35.645
to defend

44:36.524 --> 44:38.122
to preserve

44:41.620 --> 44:43.318
our own minds.

44:55.508 --> 44:58.046
Very carefully, it's perfect.

44:58.985 --> 45:00.114
Great.

45:01.023 --> 45:02.302
Let me have a look.

45:05.310 --> 45:07.158
You just made your own...

45:07.758 --> 45:10.446
Wow. I don't care what
they say, you're doing great.

45:11.445 --> 45:13.483
I had hard time with
math too. It takes time.

45:14.372 --> 45:16.411
Wow, that is damn cool.

45:18.329 --> 45:19.947
Hi guys.

45:20.257 --> 45:21.876
Thank you for staying late,

45:22.426 --> 45:24.494
all 15 or 20 of you.

45:25.792 --> 45:30.564
Today we'll be presented
with a new course work

45:30.565 --> 45:33.117
engineered to boost
State exam performance,

45:33.118 --> 45:35.685
as mandated by
"No child had left behind".

45:41.740 --> 45:45.557
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to be here.

45:45.558 --> 45:48.982
I've come today with some
edifying materials

45:48.983 --> 45:53.239
to help your matriculating and
non matric students

45:53.240 --> 45:56.478
to better prepare for the
upcoming State Exams this May.

45:56.761 --> 45:58.161
Let me start by stating

45:58.166 --> 46:00.823
I love teachers.

46:01.423 --> 46:03.052
I love what you do,

46:03.272 --> 46:04.890
what you stand for.

46:05.210 --> 46:08.947
You guys are the real heroes.

46:09.137 --> 46:11.934
Now, the one thing I've learned
in all my years in the private sector,

46:12.743 --> 46:13.833
is that

46:14.033 --> 46:17.240
real estate generates revenue.

46:17.340 --> 46:20.268
And merchanting property values
will be this school's saving grades.

46:20.977 --> 46:23.944
But your school's
low test scores

46:24.763 --> 46:27.980
are bringing down the whole re-sale
value in this neighborhood

46:27.981 --> 46:30.489
during the market already in decline.

46:31.278 --> 46:33.117
We gotta get the scores up -

46:33.137 --> 46:35.155
new families in our district

46:36.873 --> 46:38.892
and more motivated
kids in the school.

46:39.672 --> 46:41.329
And I am not placing any blame.

46:41.330 --> 46:44.227
Excuse me, are you here
to sell some tests material

46:44.228 --> 46:47.565
or to air your concerns
as a property owner?

46:47.575 --> 46:50.613
Listen, umm... I am curious.

46:50.623 --> 46:53.620
Are you givin' away pop-corn with
this crap that you're pushing?

46:53.719 --> 46:57.076
This faculty has spent their lives
on the boards, and now you tell us

46:57.077 --> 47:00.565
that our careers are
about re-sale value.

47:00.569 --> 47:02.030
- Bullshit!
- Give him hell lady...

47:02.293 --> 47:04.132
- Storm the game.
- Don't oversimplify it, mam.

47:04.151 --> 47:05.509
That's a hazard you
can't afford.

47:05.510 --> 47:06.798
This sounds like a threat.

47:06.799 --> 47:08.347
Could you please sit down?

47:08.348 --> 47:09.666
That's enough.
Could you please sit down?

47:09.667 --> 47:12.335
Can we have some
order here, please.

47:14.223 --> 47:15.891
Dr. Heart was right.

47:16.351 --> 47:18.878
This school's the pride of
the district. - Can you get back, pal?

47:18.879 --> 47:20.697
Could you finish your pitch,
we'd like to go home?

47:20.817 --> 47:22.326
What's you hurry, hon?

47:22.636 --> 47:25.114
You gotta...

47:25.394 --> 47:28.360
So enjoy running this relic
for a few more months.

47:28.361 --> 47:31.918
You're a fossil when
you're fucking done.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.717
You're dread going home?

47:45.916 --> 47:50.063
Frankly, I don't know what to do
with myself when I'm not in my classroom.

47:50.064 --> 47:53.680
So, Friday afternoons
I am afraid to go home.

47:54.220 --> 47:56.498
Afraid of all that time alone.

47:58.556 --> 47:59.795
Yeah.

48:04.760 --> 48:08.078
My mother hates
my father passionately...

48:08.418 --> 48:09.856
watches a lot of TV

48:10.086 --> 48:12.704
the only time that I don't feel.

48:12.984 --> 48:15.631
- I teach for selfish reasons...
- My mother was in Mac Madisson.

48:15.721 --> 48:17.300
I need a control.

48:17.301 --> 48:19.987
I need those kids more than...

48:19.988 --> 48:22.225
Its the moments in school...

48:22.226 --> 48:24.753
It must be like

48:24.754 --> 48:25.993
best teacher I ever had...

48:30.836 --> 48:33.484
So what's your story?

48:33.986 --> 48:35.803
My story?

48:39.480 --> 48:45.804
I'm just... I'm just taking
one thing at a time.

48:46.404 --> 48:49.569
Why are you wasting your life?
You know...

48:49.570 --> 48:51.939
I teach every day, I mean...

48:53.937 --> 48:55.945
You don't really know me.

48:56.595 --> 48:58.454
So what happened to you?

49:07.026 --> 49:09.634
You don't want something
more permanent?

49:27.489 --> 49:28.890
- Hi.
- Where have you been?

49:29.478 --> 49:30.816
What? I was out.

49:31.855 --> 49:35.912
- With a colleague.
- The boy or girl?

49:36.821 --> 49:38.890
A woman.

49:39.410 --> 49:43.766
You make me feel so stupid.
Why are you treating me like a kid?

49:45.475 --> 49:47.323
Because you're a kid.

49:48.162 --> 49:51.859
I am sorry.
I wasn't expecting this.

49:51.879 --> 49:55.366
All you had to do was tell me
you were gonna be home later.

49:55.406 --> 49:57.195
Back up, alright?

50:00.791 --> 50:03.908
I'm not beholden to you, okay?

50:03.909 --> 50:06.906
I mean, you're welcome
to stay here, but

50:07.036 --> 50:09.694
you know, you don't get to
have expectations of me, alright?

50:09.824 --> 50:13.831
This is a temporary thing, you...
you're able to stay here, but...

50:14.031 --> 50:16.039
eventually you're gonna
have to go, you understand?

50:16.389 --> 50:18.257
- I think it is important...
- It's clear.

50:19.007 --> 50:20.665
I get it, you want
me to go now?

50:21.125 --> 50:24.352
I got better to do
than clean up the stuff.

50:27.749 --> 50:29.797
I can't believe you made dinner.

50:30.317 --> 50:31.896
With what?

50:32.396 --> 50:36.352
Goceries, from the goceries store.

50:39.410 --> 50:43.726
Wow, it's really nice kid.

50:44.825 --> 50:48.403
It's been long time since
somebody cooked me.

50:49.132 --> 50:50.760
Thank you Erica.

50:50.840 --> 50:55.836
We all have problems, we all
have things that we're dealing with.

50:55.837 --> 50:58.639
And we all...

50:59.542 --> 51:03.699
Take them home with us at night,

51:04.399 --> 51:07.496
take them to work
with us in the morning.

51:13.521 --> 51:21.513
I think that helplesness, that
realization, that foreboding of

51:22.903 --> 51:28.269
being a drift in the sea,
with no

51:29.309 --> 51:34.314
no bowie, no saftey, when you
thought you'd be the one.

51:35.384 --> 51:37.671
Throwing the bowie.

51:52.769 --> 51:54.647
Hi...

51:56.455 --> 52:00.791
- Anything for dinner?
- Tell me all about it from the beginning -

52:01.182 --> 52:04.699
- You don't care.
- Oh no...

52:04.799 --> 52:06.607
so much, and well.

52:07.776 --> 52:10.335
You are so condescending.

52:14.341 --> 52:15.549
Give me a kiss.

52:18.308 --> 52:22.854
Come on.
We'll solve everything.

52:23.224 --> 52:24.792
- Come on.
- Stop it.

52:32.675 --> 52:38.690
Do you remember when
I bought you this?

52:42.357 --> 52:44.615
The beautiful summer in Venice

52:44.685 --> 52:50.680
before our travells were
resigned to reviving old passions.

53:14.061 --> 53:15.880
" You suck!"

54:15.809 --> 54:17.814
- Bloody?
- Yeah.

54:53.448 --> 54:57.465
Grandpa, you doing any writing
of your journal? - No...

54:58.674 --> 55:01.262
I don't remember much.

55:02.861 --> 55:08.026
I lost the habbit. You
can't think in this place.

55:08.027 --> 55:10.524
You can't make new memories.

55:29.759 --> 55:30.988
Thank you.

57:27.101 --> 57:28.919
- You alright?
- What?

57:29.794 --> 57:32.593
- You see me?
- You see me standing here?

57:32.893 --> 57:34.767
Yes, I see you.

57:35.934 --> 57:41.929
Oh God, its so relentless.
Thank you.

58:02.642 --> 58:05.000
" Carol, there is no nice way
for me to do this."

58:05.039 --> 58:07.818
"I spoke with the Superintendent."

58:07.828 --> 58:11.775
"He's agreed to let you
out the rest of the year."

58:11.776 --> 58:12.844
" It is where it is."

58:12.944 --> 58:18.078
"Take your pension..."

58:24.114 --> 58:28.409
Haven't you ever had enough.

58:28.410 --> 58:32.487
Havent' you ever just wanted
to tell someone to fuck off.

58:32.488 --> 58:33.796
I think I am sick.

58:34.745 --> 58:36.753
- Why?
- I crossed the line today.

58:36.754 --> 58:40.979
I mean the whole...
the whole thing is fucked.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.908
Whole thing is fuck, is it not?

58:44.941 --> 58:47.153
What's up, Dr. Parker?

58:47.354 --> 58:49.793
Can we get over it?
I got shit to do.

58:52.670 --> 58:56.047
What are your plans after High School
since you're not going to college?

58:56.317 --> 58:57.776
I don't know.

58:57.985 --> 59:02.772
Hanging out with my boyfriend.
Do some modelling shit...

59:04.190 --> 59:07.087
- Be in my friend's band.
- I have your 10-week grade report.

59:07.088 --> 59:08.017
Do you know what it says?

59:08.021 --> 59:09.974
Fail, Fail, Fail.

59:10.205 --> 59:12.104
- F, F, F.
- F, F, F yah.

59:12.874 --> 59:14.752
You know what that means?
It mean you don't care.

59:14.756 --> 59:16.322
You're brilliant.

59:20.118 --> 59:22.301
Can I go now?

59:23.335 --> 59:25.932
Oh god, you are a shallow
disgusting creature.

59:27.591 --> 59:33.265
You want to know the truth?
One, you're not gonna be in a band

59:33.266 --> 59:36.734
or an Model Missy,
because you have no ambition.

59:37.433 --> 59:39.041
With no skills, you'll be competing

59:39.051 --> 59:41.899
with the 80% of the U.S. workforce
for a minimum wage job

59:41.900 --> 59:43.577
which you'll work at
for the rest of your life

59:43.578 --> 59:45.545
til you're replaced by a computer.

59:45.546 --> 59:47.354
- I don't care.
- Two...

59:47.355 --> 59:50.732
The only talent you'll ever have
is getting men to fuck you.

59:50.931 --> 59:53.309
Your life will basically
become a carnivall of pain.

59:53.310 --> 59:54.778
Now, when you can't stand it

59:54.779 --> 59:58.266
not one more day,
not one more hour,

59:59.495 --> 01:00:02.552
it will get worse, much worse!

01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:06.753
Every day I come into
this office and listen

01:00:06.766 --> 01:00:09.407
to you kids shit all
over yourselves!

01:00:10.706 --> 01:00:15.712
It's so easy to be careless. It takes
courage to take care.

01:00:16.121 --> 01:00:18.948
Not that you have any
of those qualities.

01:00:20.906 --> 01:00:25.023
Get out! Just get out!
Get out! - Fuck You!!!

01:00:30.179 --> 01:00:32.698
- I am a total burn out.
- You are not.

01:00:33.057 --> 01:00:36.754
I am. - I mean I don't know how
you make it through the day.

01:00:36.764 --> 01:00:41.019
Listen, seriously why do you
think I take these pills for?

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.688
I mean, that's a.

01:00:44.348 --> 01:00:48.993
If I didn't take these things I'd be
committing mass murder.

01:00:49.473 --> 01:00:52.011
And I'll be helping throwing their
fucking kids out of the window.

01:00:52.012 --> 01:00:54.043
Come on, you're the best.

01:00:55.162 --> 01:00:57.795
I'll tell you my opinion, the worst
thing about this job

01:00:58.736 --> 01:01:00.834
is that nobody says thank you.

01:01:02.503 --> 01:01:03.472
- No.
- No.

01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:06.878
I'm here to say thank you.

01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:09.037
You're doing the job,
that none of us can do.

01:01:09.038 --> 01:01:10.654
None of us.

01:01:11.765 --> 01:01:17.249
Grace? - Have I ever I told you
that you're the only person

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.629
I have to talk to.

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:30.326
- Hi Henry.
- What happened?

01:01:30.719 --> 01:01:32.458
They called to your house.

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.484
Your grandfather felt
some chest pains. - Yeah?

01:01:37.324 --> 01:01:39.282
The Doctor says he's stable.

01:01:40.101 --> 01:01:41.829
He doesn't have a lot of time.

01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.863
- I am so sorry Henry.
- How long...

01:01:46.865 --> 01:01:48.034
have you been here?

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:51.022
Since this morning, I didn't know
how to get a hold of you?

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:53.959
I don't know where you work.

01:01:54.489 --> 01:01:57.167
You've been here
all day with him?

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.788
Hi, Grandpa.

01:02:08.218 --> 01:02:10.516
You're still hanging
in there, I see.

01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:17.290
Oh, hi sweetheart. Your mother
was with me today.

01:02:18.042 --> 01:02:20.756
Did you see her?

01:02:23.525 --> 01:02:28.351
No. I told her I was
afraid to leave you.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:32.047
But she promised

01:02:32.048 --> 01:02:36.595
that she'd look after you.
Well, I'm sure she meant that.

01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:41.840
Patricia, darling...

01:02:43.006 --> 01:02:45.920
You've forgiven me, haven't you?

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:59.775
What do you need to be
forgiven for, daddy?

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:06.060
Well, those things.
You know, the things I did.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:10.106
All you ever did
was take care of me.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:15.122
- Always looked after me.
- Weren't you afraid of me?

01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:19.918
No, daddy, not.

01:03:19.922 --> 01:03:24.094
I know how you get sometimes
you get little mixed up.

01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:30.140
You feel responsible for the
things that you didn't do.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.417
So I wasn't the one
that hurt you?

01:03:34.057 --> 01:03:38.142
No sir, that wasn't you.

01:03:38.143 --> 01:03:41.710
I hope it wasn't true.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:48.125
Patricia, darling.
I've always loved you.

01:03:51.182 --> 01:03:59.174
Daddy, you can feel free to leave,
whenever you're ready.

01:04:03.533 --> 01:04:08.088
Do you know that? That's okay.

01:04:08.697 --> 01:04:11.645
There is nothing to fear.

01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:27.083
Come on.

01:04:27.543 --> 01:04:30.550
Let's get outa here.

01:04:32.228 --> 01:04:39.263
Is Patricia your mom?
What happened to her?

01:04:39.912 --> 01:04:41.441
She left a while ago.

01:04:42.398 --> 01:04:43.989
You mean she died?

01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:52.212
How did she die?

01:04:54.929 --> 01:04:59.166
My father left when I was a kid.
I don't really remember him.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:05.190
It was always the three of us,
mother and grandpa and I together

01:05:05.191 --> 01:05:07.779
in his house.

01:05:10.886 --> 01:05:14.104
I found her... on the floor.

01:05:18.769 --> 01:05:21.068
She'd taken enough pills...

01:05:25.185 --> 01:05:29.790
and grandpa at that moment,
kinda of lost it...

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.560
* For Henry *

01:05:31.949 --> 01:05:34.477
I sat with grandpa
on the porch, and

01:05:34.487 --> 01:05:39.523
and we watched as they
came and took her away.

01:05:40.097 --> 01:05:41.738
How old were you?

01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:49.135
Seven.

01:05:50.743 --> 01:05:53.261
I don't know for sure, but I...

01:05:54.461 --> 01:05:58.776
think my mother was young
when something happened.

01:05:58.976 --> 01:06:03.453
With her and grandpa.
Were you afraid of it?

01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:04.991
No.

01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:09.997
Did she ever say
anything to you?

01:06:13.165 --> 01:06:14.763
No.

01:06:15.762 --> 01:06:21.158
But looking back on it, I think she
protected me in her own way.

01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:23.195
How?

01:06:27.023 --> 01:06:30.241
She made me lock
my door at night.

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:00.805
The park is now empty and bare,
with an abandoned chain.

01:07:02.593 --> 01:07:06.640
The jungle Jim, the slide and
swing have rusted together.

01:07:07.909 --> 01:07:10.477
They're all so terribly alone now.

01:07:11.177 --> 01:07:12.795
Where did all the children go?

01:07:13.664 --> 01:07:15.892
Didn't they know that
the park needed them?

01:07:17.152 --> 01:07:21.827
The child's intelligent heart can find 'em
in the depth of many dark places.

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:27.223
I cannot find 'em, the delicate
moment of its own detachment.

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:45.728
- Hi Mr. Barthes.
- Hello Meredith.

01:07:46.624 --> 01:07:49.835
- How's going?
- Fine, I am alright...

01:07:50.793 --> 01:07:53.651
I made a picture for you.

01:07:54.231 --> 01:07:55.519
Come here.

01:07:56.558 --> 01:07:58.627
- You did?
- Yeah.

01:08:05.731 --> 01:08:11.157
Wow, it's beautiful, and it's a...
You're really talented.

01:08:11.986 --> 01:08:13.693
Thanks. Have you been
doing this for a long time?

01:08:13.694 --> 01:08:16.702
Yeah, I've been doing it
since I was a kid.

01:08:18.321 --> 01:08:20.868
Faceless man in an empty room.

01:08:21.078 --> 01:08:22.697
Is that how you see me, Meredith?

01:08:23.227 --> 01:08:27.264
I don't know how I see you.

01:08:27.933 --> 01:08:30.830
It's just how thought
of you in a situation.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.437
Do you ever think about who
your teachers are outside?

01:08:35.337 --> 01:08:37.424
- In real life?
- I guess so.

01:08:38.564 --> 01:08:42.140
- Does this place seem ureal to you?
- I watched you around the school,

01:08:43.629 --> 01:08:45.725
You always seem so sad.

01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:55.080
Maybe you have a hard time with things
and you need someone to talk to.

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.965
- Meredith.
- Yes Sir.

01:09:05.796 --> 01:09:09.997
- Do you need someone to talk to?
- Yes, will you talk to me?

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:16.772
When you talk to me, when you look
at me, it's like you really see me.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.180
I do see you Meredith.

01:09:21.438 --> 01:09:23.435
Do you wanna go see Dr. Parker?

01:09:23.446 --> 01:09:26.183
Oh come on, don't pull me off

01:09:26.184 --> 01:09:28.211
I am not, I am not...

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:31.420
What can I do?

01:09:32.889 --> 01:09:35.575
It's like you said, we're...

01:09:35.576 --> 01:09:40.982
There is nothing left. Nothing but
to realize how fucked up things are...

01:09:40.983 --> 01:09:43.390
It's not enough. I won't last.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.817
Listen to me. Just listen.

01:09:49.236 --> 01:09:51.813
We're all the same.

01:09:51.823 --> 01:09:54.361
We all feel pain.

01:09:54.381 --> 01:10:00.067
We all have chaos in our lives.

01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:03.473
Life is very, very
confusing, I know.

01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:07.690
I don't have the answers,
but I know if you write it out.

01:10:08.779 --> 01:10:11.227
It'll all be okay.

01:10:12.117 --> 01:10:16.392
- Mr. Barthes, do you like me?
- Of course I do.

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:28.123
Meredith, please don't.
You know I'd like to help you.

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:30.771
- Please, please.
- No, no.

01:10:30.871 --> 01:10:34.208
- You don't...
- You said you liked me, please...

01:10:35.218 --> 01:10:36.336
Please, please...

01:10:36.396 --> 01:10:38.953
Oh please, don't push me away.

01:10:38.954 --> 01:10:43.550
Please, just hold on to me, and tell
me that everything's gonna be O.K.

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.788
Everything is...
It is okay, please.

01:10:51.683 --> 01:10:56.120
- Please... no, no...
- Meredith, wait a second.

01:10:56.889 --> 01:10:58.938
- What's going on?
- What?

01:10:59.317 --> 01:11:01.235
- Meredith, Meredith.
- What were you just doing?

01:11:01.395 --> 01:11:02.897
Meredith, I am sorry.

01:11:04.075 --> 01:11:05.524
- What were you doing?
- What?

01:11:06.454 --> 01:11:08.040
What are you doing?

01:11:08.239 --> 01:11:10.448
- Excuse me?!
- You were just touching her.

01:11:10.718 --> 01:11:12.455
What do you... what are
you insinuating?

01:11:12.456 --> 01:11:15.342
It is inappropriate to be in here
alone with that young girl.

01:11:15.343 --> 01:11:17.731
It is inappropriate?!
She needed someone to talk to.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:21.159
- What do you think I'm doing, lady?
- I don't know what you're doing.

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:22.797
"Just make me close."

01:11:22.798 --> 01:11:25.345
What do you think I am fucking pervert?
Is that what you're insinuating?

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.373
She needed someone
to talk to her.

01:11:28.124 --> 01:11:30.711
- Than why were you touching her?
- I wasn't touching her.

01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:32.529
"It's alright my dear."

01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.776
"Patricia?"

01:11:37.115 --> 01:11:39.657
I'm not... not a sick old man!

01:11:41.073 --> 01:11:43.101
Is that what you think of me?

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.778
Is that what you think?

01:11:47.967 --> 01:11:50.644
I just wanted to help her!

01:11:57.710 --> 01:11:59.925
- Get out! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- What am I supposed to think?

01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:02.145
You're supposed to...
Fuck into a fucking judgment!

01:12:19.081 --> 01:12:22.464
Hello, no he's not home.

01:12:46.568 --> 01:12:48.616
Hello Mr. Barthes.

01:12:50.845 --> 01:12:56.850
Whenever you feel like you are ready
we do have some paperwork downstairs

01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:58.908
that we need you to
take care of.

01:13:04.651 --> 01:13:06.247
I am sorry.

01:13:51.564 --> 01:13:54.562
I wish things were different.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:14:03.114
I tried, you know... Fuck...
The things is... We all...

01:14:07.961 --> 01:14:10.708
We all have problems. We all
have things that we're dealing with.

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:14.744
Some days were better than others.
Somedays were not so great.

01:14:14.745 --> 01:14:19.541
Some days we have limited space

01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:21.499
for others.

01:14:37.216 --> 01:14:40.043
Hey. I made breakfast.

01:14:41.152 --> 01:14:43.000
Want some milk?

01:14:45.389 --> 01:14:49.446
These kids need something else.

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:53.878
They don't need me.

01:15:00.057 --> 01:15:02.725
- Are you O.K?
- Yeah, I'm not hungry.

01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:17.113
You know, you can't
keep living on the street.

01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:20.090
I am not. I mean, I'm staying
here with you.

01:15:20.091 --> 01:15:22.909
You can't continue
to stay here with me.

01:15:23.278 --> 01:15:25.995
- I'm not good for you.
- That's not true.

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:29.982
You're the only family
I've ever had.

01:15:30.572 --> 01:15:32.790
Well, I can't be your family.

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:42.902
I can't give you what you need.

01:15:51.954 --> 01:15:55.011
You have to understand,
you should be... - You are good...

01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:57.847
And gentle...

01:15:59.278 --> 01:16:01.356
You're the most kind.

01:16:06.432 --> 01:16:09.430
I love you Henry.

01:16:16.154 --> 01:16:18.892
- Come in. -Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:20.061 --> 01:16:21.300
Hello there.

01:16:22.859 --> 01:16:26.826
- Erica...
- Don't let them take me...

01:16:26.925 --> 01:16:28.364
Please...

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.842
- Noo...
- Listen, you should...

01:16:31.941 --> 01:16:35.748
You are all
that I have, please...

01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:39.764
- Don't let me go.
- You should go, sorry.

01:16:39.765 --> 01:16:42.597
- No, no...
- No, don't do this...

01:16:43.276 --> 01:16:44.475
- Henry! Henry!
- You should go.

01:16:44.491 --> 01:16:45.999
- Henry!
- You have to let go.

01:16:46.002 --> 01:16:48.073
- Henry!
- You have to...

01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:51.641
- Henry!
- You have to leg go now.

01:16:51.642 --> 01:16:53.729
Henry!

01:16:54.032 --> 01:16:56.241
- Her things?
- Yeah.

01:16:56.295 --> 01:16:59.165
- Henry! Henry!
- Come on.

01:17:00.937 --> 01:17:03.645
- No! No!...
- Things will be okay.

01:17:04.424 --> 01:17:06.251
Don't do this.

01:17:06.252 --> 01:17:09.969
- You gonna be okay.
- No! No! No!

01:17:10.365 --> 01:17:13.016
No!...

01:18:01.846 --> 01:18:04.074
Well... I feel
just awful for her.

01:18:05.705 --> 01:18:07.512
- For who?
- For our school.

01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:14.206
It may sound strange but I've always
felt that the school had a spirit.

01:18:14.983 --> 01:18:18.584
It's not just an budgetful buildings,
but they're alive.

01:18:23.459 --> 01:18:27.055
I just can't understand it.
Where are all the parents?

01:18:31.241 --> 01:18:32.776
I don't know.

01:18:38.426 --> 01:18:41.943
I was in my room for two
hours and saw one parent.

01:18:41.953 --> 01:18:43.951
Where are they?
Where is everybody?

01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:46.949
- We don't know.
- It's uncanny.

01:18:47.419 --> 01:18:50.815
No air raid sirensl No bombs.

01:18:51.045 --> 01:18:52.515
It doesn't happen that way.

01:18:53.044 --> 01:18:56.661
It starts in whisper,
then nothing.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.929
We had our music once,
didn't we?

01:18:59.746 --> 01:19:01.036
Yes, we did.

01:19:04.075 --> 01:19:07.042
Do you remember those nights
we only had two parents at a time?

01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:09.701
And then there were more,
there were many more

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:13.037
waiting in the waiting rooms.

01:19:13.038 --> 01:19:16.585
And halls were full of joy and
celebration. Now, it's nothing.

01:19:16.735 --> 01:19:20.421
Rememberance. The things passed.

01:19:20.631 --> 01:19:22.919
I actually felt quite at home.

01:19:23.219 --> 01:19:24.787
There were no parents.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:30.603
I thought how appropriate.
It was like, a moment of insight

01:19:31.761 --> 01:19:36.008
the reality of the fucking
problem in the first place.

01:19:41.034 --> 01:19:46.080
Some of us believe that
we can make a difference.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:49.786
And sometimes we wake up

01:19:52.714 --> 01:19:54.543
and we realize we've failed.

01:20:06.493 --> 01:20:08.991
Hi it's Gretchen
calling from the Clinic,

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:11.559
Erica Loius has her
test results back.

01:20:11.898 --> 01:20:14.637
Please give us a call
at your earliest convenience.

01:20:14.638 --> 01:20:15.449
Thank you.

01:20:40.972 --> 01:20:43.669
" - You have good parents"
" - Bitch you shut up."

01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:45.955
"A Mother of mine gave her..."

01:20:46.455 --> 01:20:50.007
" A Diet Bitch!"
" ha ha... ha ha... ha ha."

01:20:51.606 --> 01:20:53.823
" What is all this supposed to be?
Your tortured soul?"

01:20:58.490 --> 01:21:01.208
" - I won't stand that, Dad!"
" - Paint something more cheerful ..."

01:21:01.294 --> 01:21:06.082
" We have to pay us our lives ..."
" Grow like your hair, lost some weight."

01:21:06.083 --> 01:21:07.423
" It'll all be okay."

01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:11.787
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

01:21:11.788 --> 01:21:14.006
Before we take roll,

01:21:14.007 --> 01:21:19.043
I want to tell you that today
will be my last day with you.

01:21:20.092 --> 01:21:22.150
You're gonna have
a permanent teacher on Monday.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:24.898
- Where are you going, Mr. Barthes?
- I'll go to another school.

01:21:26.327 --> 01:21:30.682
- We will miss you, man.
- Yeah?

01:21:30.683 --> 01:21:33.441
All those teachers in
this place... They're dickheads.

01:21:34.218 --> 01:21:36.960
Don't you get tired of
moving around all the time?

01:21:37.158 --> 01:21:42.862
It's how my job works. I come
in here for a period of time,

01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:44.891
so you don't have twnenty
subs in and I'm outa here,

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:49.897
and then, you have a
permanent teacher come in

01:21:49.917 --> 01:21:52.185
and I leave.

01:21:53.954 --> 01:21:56.421
Attention to all teachers,
this is an special

01:21:56.434 --> 01:21:58.910
announcement from the
Principle's Office.

01:22:00.139 --> 01:22:03.126
There will an all faculty meeting
today, during nutrition...

01:22:03.795 --> 01:22:06.553
Student nutrition will be extended

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:09.800
a ten minutes, thank you.

01:22:54.553 --> 01:23:00.079
I invited you here today
to discuss the status things.

01:23:00.598 --> 01:23:04.625
I know that there wasn't...
I know that there isn't...

01:23:12.439 --> 01:23:16.126
- I am sorry...
- We all need something,

01:23:16.725 --> 01:23:23.490
to destract us from the
complexity and reality.

01:23:24.389 --> 01:23:27.287
More or less to think about
where that came from?

01:23:28.176 --> 01:23:34.680
No one wants to think about
the struggle that it takes

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:37.707
to become somebody
to get out of

01:23:41.813 --> 01:23:43.646
to get out of the...

01:23:44.313 --> 01:23:47.010
the sea of pain that,
we all have to get out of.

01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:58.600
- Hi Meredith.
- Hi.

01:24:00.718 --> 01:24:02.747
Haven't seen you
in class lately?

01:24:03.529 --> 01:24:05.053
Where have you been?

01:24:05.544 --> 01:24:07.983
- Baking.
- I see.

01:24:09.152 --> 01:24:11.689
I am happy I get to see you.
Today is my last day.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:15.456
How ironic!

01:24:16.126 --> 01:24:19.953
Listen, I was thinking,
I bought this for myself, but

01:24:20.932 --> 01:24:25.209
maybe you could make
better use of it.

01:24:37.119 --> 01:24:39.906
- I like that one the best.
- You can't have that one.

01:24:40.406 --> 01:24:42.114
It's mine.

01:24:43.643 --> 01:24:46.940
But, can you have this one?

01:24:47.330 --> 01:24:49.828
- It's better for you anyway.
- Thanks.

01:24:51.177 --> 01:24:52.815
I am sorry.

01:24:54.434 --> 01:24:57.991
If I hurt you
in any way, I um...

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:06.563
I know that its tough
right now, for you,

01:25:06.564 --> 01:25:11.559
but it's not always gonna be this...
Goodbye Mr. Barthes.

01:25:16.176 --> 01:25:18.205
Goodbye Meredith.

01:26:01.688 --> 01:26:05.955
They say that suicide is a permanent
solution to the temporary problem.

01:26:06.914 --> 01:26:08.782
I'll let you know?

01:26:11.201 --> 01:26:14.717
My name is Meredith and
I wanted to kill myself.

01:26:46.631 --> 01:26:48.250
Meredith!

01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:50.198
No!

01:26:52.546 --> 01:26:54.394
Henry!

01:26:56.742 --> 01:27:00.160
It's gonna be O.K.
It's gonna be O.K.

01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:06.494
It's gonna be O.K.

01:27:10.381 --> 01:27:18.373
We have such a responsibility to guide
our young so that they don't end up

01:27:19.633 --> 01:27:22.291
falling apart.

01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:25.548
Falling by the way side.

01:27:28.852 --> 01:27:31.429
Becoming insignificant.

01:28:52.904 --> 01:28:55.533
I realized something today.

01:28:58.661 --> 01:29:03.048
I'm a non-person, Sarah.

01:29:05.896 --> 01:29:11.951
You shouldn't be here.
I am not here.

01:29:14.258 --> 01:29:16.946
You may see me,

01:29:18.735 --> 01:29:23.731
but I'm hollow.

01:29:56.403 --> 01:30:01.429
Failing. We're failing.

01:30:04.327 --> 01:30:11.131
Failed in a sense that we
have let everyone down.

01:30:11.826 --> 01:30:13.673
Including ourselves.

01:31:23.241 --> 01:31:26.789
When you're walking down
the hallway, or in your classroom,

01:31:27.288 --> 01:31:30.685
how many of you

01:31:31.484 --> 01:31:37.750
have ever felt the weight
pressing down on you?

01:31:39.358 --> 01:31:41.616
I have.

01:31:45.043 --> 01:31:47.171
Everyone?

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:49.300
Wow!

01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:53.566
Poe wrote about these
things over a 100 years ago.

01:31:53.606 --> 01:31:57.423
So, as we read

01:31:57.673 --> 01:32:00.860
we can see that.

01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:04.257
"The House of Usher"
is not merely an old

01:32:04.777 --> 01:32:07.685
decrapped castle...

01:32:09.013 --> 01:32:12.711
It is also a state of being.

01:32:18.855 --> 01:32:22.970
" During the whole of dull,
dark and soundless day."

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:28.609
" In the autumn of that year, when the
clouds hung oppressively low in heavens,."

01:32:30.208 --> 01:32:33.489
" I had been passing
alone, on the horseback,."

01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:37.167
" Through the singularly
dreary tract of country;"

01:32:38.028 --> 01:32:42.204
