01:14.555 --> 01:19.275
Tell me a little about yourself.

01:22.155 --> 01:25.674
I do not know what to say.

01:25.754 --> 01:28.514
I am 43 and divorced.

01:29.514 --> 01:33.954
I have a son, but it
bother you not hear about.

01:34.034 --> 01:35.994
Yes I would like to.

01:36.074 --> 01:40.594
Sorry, but this is the first
time I do something here.

01:40.674 --> 01:43.994
It is okay. There is no hurry.

01:45.034 --> 01:48.874
You have a nice voice.

01:51.394 --> 01:54.594
It's sexy.

01:54.674 --> 01:58.673
- Do you think so?
- If I do.

01:58.753 --> 02:01.753
You're easy to talk to.

02:03.713 --> 02:07.953
- You're probably good at your job.
- The damage might not.

02:09.913 --> 02:13.753
- Now you tell us a little.
- What do you want to know?

02:17.513 --> 02:20.353
I do not know...

02:20.433 --> 02:22.793
What are you wearing?

02:26.273 --> 02:29.112
- Kevlar.
- Wow, how sexy!

02:31.272 --> 02:34.392
The shooter is in position.
Keep him on the line.

02:34.472 --> 02:38.952
- Haas, let me persuade him.
- We shoot as soon as we can.

02:39.032 --> 02:43.592
Are you insane?
If you shoot, so people die there.

02:44.712 --> 02:46.912
Five minutes.

02:46.992 --> 02:49.392
Team one, give me a report.

02:49.472 --> 02:53.992
- Are you there? I thought you hung up.
- Yes, I'm still here.

02:54.072 --> 02:59.391
I thought that maybe we
can meet face to face.

03:02.231 --> 03:04.391
On a date?

03:04.471 --> 03:06.431
Yes.

03:08.111 --> 03:10.031
It is a lie...

03:11.271 --> 03:15.111
This should not happen.
I would not do any harm.

03:15.191 --> 03:19.831
I just wanted my
damn tax refund!

03:20.831 --> 03:22.831
Dan, I beg you.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.391
Hold on a little longer.

03:26.831 --> 03:30.271
I do not care what
happens to me.

03:32.950 --> 03:37.230
My son deserves something
better than this.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.910
Team one, be ready to shoot.

03:47.070 --> 03:49.070
Agent Blair!

03:49.150 --> 03:51.350
Hell!

04:03.469 --> 04:08.229
Dan, tell me where
we're going on a date.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.349
What?

04:16.189 --> 04:19.469
I know an Italian place.

04:20.309 --> 04:25.989
It is a small place called
Fellini's, I think.

04:26.069 --> 04:29.109
- Do they have good food?
- Yeah, it's fantastic.

04:29.189 --> 04:32.109
It's where I proposed
to my bitch an ex-wife.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.868
So maybe we should
go somewhere else.

04:40.748 --> 04:45.668
I know not how you look.
How do I recognize you?

04:45.748 --> 04:48.468
Believe me, it will be difficult...

04:54.308 --> 04:56.148
... to overlook me.

04:57.668 --> 05:00.188
Whose side are you on, Blair?

05:04.108 --> 05:07.547
Would you take a bullet for one
of your disturbed admirers?

05:07.627 --> 05:12.307
If you want to follow your sick
female instinct, so here you go.

05:12.387 --> 05:15.227
So do us both a favor.

05:15.307 --> 05:21.147
But no one should die because
you can not follow orders!

05:21.227 --> 05:25.827
Agent Blair, I swear by
my life that you're done.

05:26.867 --> 05:31.347
You must be out of my unit,
my city and my time zone.

05:31.427 --> 05:36.107
They find you never during all
the paperwork, I bury you under.

05:36.187 --> 05:39.586
Your telefonsexdage is over.
Are you following?

05:54.786 --> 05:57.226
Good evening. Welcome on board.

05:57.306 --> 06:01.226
- Welcome on board. Lovely bag.
- Thank you.

06:01.306 --> 06:04.386
Good evening, sir. Welcome aboard.

06:34.705 --> 06:36.465
Pardon.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.304
Excuse me.

06:53.024 --> 06:55.064
Is this your place?

06:57.744 --> 07:02.024
- Unfortunately not.
- Typically. Surely a crying child.

07:02.104 --> 07:04.264
I hope not.

07:12.023 --> 07:16.623
After all, I'm already tired
of snobs in the first class.

07:16.703 --> 07:20.023
My name is Claire.
We have not worked together before.

07:20.103 --> 07:23.903
- Is this your first trip per night for D.C.?
- No.

07:23.983 --> 07:27.823
You stay here while Rick
reviewing safety procedures -

07:27.903 --> 07:32.143
- and then immediately begin
to serve food and drink.

07:32.223 --> 07:34.263
Well then. Thanks.

07:43.102 --> 07:47.862
Excuse me, but it
has been my place.

07:54.422 --> 07:57.262
I actually have the window seat.

07:59.262 --> 08:03.222
- I already strapped me down.
- Okay...

08:13.821 --> 08:17.901
- Not to be difficult, but...
- It is okay.

08:21.821 --> 08:23.901
You're sitting in my seat.

08:23.981 --> 08:27.941
It does not matter.
Sit However, just somewhere else.

08:28.021 --> 08:34.181
Listen, asshole. I do not want to.
There is actually 44A on my ticket.

08:34.260 --> 08:40.020
Move or I skinning the cat
sweatshirt you and stop it up...

08:40.101 --> 08:43.541
- Is everything all right here?
- She threatened me.

08:43.621 --> 08:46.660
I am terribly sorry.
Pardon.

08:47.940 --> 08:53.900
Sorry, but it's been a long day,
and I will not be a nuisance.

08:53.980 --> 08:58.220
I would just sit in my
seat, which he has taken -

08:58.300 --> 09:02.740
- and close your eyes and sleep for five hours.

09:02.820 --> 09:07.500
Can we offer something to
drink or a little snack?

09:09.140 --> 09:12.860
- I want a free meal.
- It comes immediately.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.900
Will you come with me?

09:18.979 --> 09:22.899
- And an extension to the safety belt.
- Of course.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.379
Sorry again.

09:25.459 --> 09:28.939
I am terribly sorry.

09:29.019 --> 09:33.739
I usually deal with people better.
It did not mean to shout.

09:34.339 --> 09:37.419
You sit probably better here.

09:37.499 --> 09:41.779
- Do you mean it?
- We can not bear trouble in tourist class.

09:41.859 --> 09:46.179
- I thought you were going to throw me off.
- Oh no. I take it there.

09:46.259 --> 09:48.578
- Thank you.
- No reason.

09:48.658 --> 09:52.658
By the way, I've always dreamed
of doing what you just did.

09:53.858 --> 09:57.298
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

09:57.938 --> 10:01.018
This is your captain.

10:01.098 --> 10:05.138
It takes a few minutes before
we roll out from the gate.

10:05.218 --> 10:09.858
So do you it convenient,
we are soon in the air.

10:10.858 --> 10:16.298
The weather is clear and the flight time
is calculated to five and a half hours.

10:16.378 --> 10:18.738
Welcome on board.

10:36.217 --> 10:38.937
- Is this your first time?
- Pardon?

10:39.017 --> 10:41.617
At the first class.

10:41.697 --> 10:45.017
- Do I look so forlorn?
- No, on the contrary.

10:45.097 --> 10:47.257
If you get this one here?

10:48.897 --> 10:51.536
You seem to belong here.

10:54.736 --> 10:56.856
Terry. Terry Lennox.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.936
Blair. Gretchen Blair.

11:02.016 --> 11:06.296
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Yes please.

11:07.936 --> 11:11.376
- Excuse me, may I ask...
- No, sit.

11:11.456 --> 11:13.416
A washcloth?

11:13.496 --> 11:15.536
Sir.?

11:20.536 --> 11:23.135
- What are you fleeing from?
- Nothing.

11:23.215 --> 11:26.255
No? Okay.

11:32.615 --> 11:38.135
Not to be rude, but I'm not so
good at small talk right now.

11:38.215 --> 11:44.495
- It is okay. I drop it like.
- It was not how I meant it.

11:44.575 --> 11:46.735
I fucked up -

11:46.815 --> 11:53.055
- and have to sit behind a desk in D.C.
rest of life. So I have no hurry.

11:53.135 --> 11:56.774
- Do not leave.
- Good thinking.

11:56.854 --> 12:01.414
Forget D.C.
and take with me to Paris instead.

12:01.494 --> 12:04.374
You were not kidding with
dropping the huddle.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.574
Why not?

12:06.654 --> 12:08.774
Because it's crazy.

12:08.854 --> 12:12.174
It's no worse than doing something
that makes you unhappy.

12:12.254 --> 12:18.734
The first class has to afford it,
but I have to stick to the rules.

12:18.814 --> 12:22.334
People follow the rules, because
they are afraid to make decisions.

12:22.414 --> 12:27.733
I work for the police, and they
go very much up in the rules.

12:32.173 --> 12:37.213
- Can I help you?
- I was wondering where you have your gun.

12:38.053 --> 12:42.533
Hello and welcome aboard
at Speedbird Airlines!

12:42.613 --> 12:47.453
May I have your attention?
Let me hear you cheer!

12:53.693 --> 12:58.252
- Let me hear you, first class.
- Shut up!

13:02.972 --> 13:04.652
Gab not!

13:09.412 --> 13:12.372
- Do you like it?
- What's happening to you?

13:12.452 --> 13:15.532
The airline, which is
your home in the air.

13:17.132 --> 13:22.172
In flies with Speedbird We
hope you enjoy the journey.

13:22.252 --> 13:24.292
Up to the table!

13:24.372 --> 13:29.371
Welcome to Speedbird, the
only thing you need to know.

13:38.011 --> 13:42.251
Hostage Dealer.
I had not guessed.

13:42.331 --> 13:45.131
- No?
- Detailed parking official.

13:45.211 --> 13:49.251
Fuck... I was good at it.

13:49.331 --> 13:53.491
Then you may encounter
some obnoxious people.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.051
Yes, constantly.

13:57.411 --> 14:00.570
Answer honestly now.
Are you ever on their side?

14:00.650 --> 14:02.810
- If the page?
- the bad guy's.

14:02.890 --> 14:05.450
No, never.

14:05.530 --> 14:11.170
In talking together and create a relationship.
You may get some sort of sympathy for them.

14:11.250 --> 14:16.050
The poor sitting locked up in a bank
with the whole world against them.

14:16.130 --> 14:19.250
While they threaten innocent with a gun.

14:19.330 --> 14:23.490
- That you have the right.
- Thank you.

14:23.570 --> 14:28.450
But sometimes, deep inside...

14:29.890 --> 14:35.689
... you hope that they will make it.
Everyone keeps with the underdog.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.328
Anything with potatoes...

15:27.408 --> 15:30.328
So easy was not to be.

15:30.408 --> 15:32.448
Nothing.

15:32.528 --> 15:34.767
Maybe we should take...

15:34.847 --> 15:38.367
- Excuse me a moment.
- Brussels sprouts sounds good.

15:41.407 --> 15:43.807
Sir...

15:43.887 --> 15:47.327
They should go back to your place.

15:51.607 --> 15:55.207
I can not decide.
They jordbærcheesecake.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.047
Should I take it or
karamelbuddingen?

15:58.127 --> 16:02.127
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine thanks.

16:34.566 --> 16:38.525
Speedbird 709
increases 1000-6000.

16:40.365 --> 16:45.125
We need to land as she sits
astride me and takes his coat.

16:45.205 --> 16:49.045
- You are joking.
- Cockburn sitting next to.

16:49.125 --> 16:53.125
He said: "Shall I take over?"

16:53.205 --> 16:56.725
So I ask:
"With the girl or the plane?"

16:56.805 --> 17:01.245
Speedbird 709, we can see
you on the radar. Idiots...

17:13.644 --> 17:16.204
Do you have a have a drink more? Terry?

17:18.124 --> 17:22.844
Want more? I did not think
you were afraid to fly.

17:22.924 --> 17:27.564
Not to fly, but more
to lose control.

17:30.204 --> 17:34.644
- Should I call the flyværtinden?
- No I...

17:34.724 --> 17:37.324
It will be fine, thank you.

17:37.404 --> 17:43.323
Do not worry. The aircraft is the most modern.
Error Security system and remote control.

17:43.403 --> 17:47.363
- As a flying tank.
- How do you know that?

17:47.443 --> 17:50.643
FBI uses it when we
practice rescue operations.

17:50.723 --> 17:54.683
We practice everything.
Stealth attack and containment.

17:54.763 --> 17:59.083
- Are you well paid?
- Not good enough to fly like this.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.043
Around 70,000?

18:01.123 --> 18:04.083
The boundary between being
eccentric and rude is subtler.

18:04.163 --> 18:08.683
Would you like to be 50 million
richer when we leave the plane here?

18:08.763 --> 18:12.322
I have plugs in your ears.
Would you repeat that?

18:12.402 --> 18:16.562
I offer you 50 million
just on the spot -

18:16.642 --> 18:19.522
- if you agree to help me.

18:19.602 --> 18:22.762
That's what I thought you said.

18:24.002 --> 18:27.242
What do you need my help?

18:27.322 --> 18:29.882
To make me live the plane.

18:46.761 --> 18:49.241
Remain open, please.

19:06.601 --> 19:10.241
What I am trying to say is that the
plane here, soon to be hijacked.

19:10.321 --> 19:16.600
They are not interested in
terrorism or politics. Only in me.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.360
- Who is it?
- One of them is a stewardess.

19:21.440 --> 19:25.600
Flyværtinde.
You do not say stewardess.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.000
She is not a real flyværtinde.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.360
She is...

19:35.360 --> 19:37.920
Who is she?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.160
My ex.

19:48.159 --> 19:52.399
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, it's okay.

19:55.919 --> 19:59.039
Maybe a little water or coffee?

19:59.119 --> 20:01.679
No, it's okay, thanks.

20:06.359 --> 20:11.639
It's a long flight, and it takes
a long time before I come back.

20:11.719 --> 20:14.639
Okay, so I take a ginger ale.

20:25.718 --> 20:28.638
Here you go.

20:30.078 --> 20:32.078
Thanks.

20:36.878 --> 20:41.198
We have not much time. I know that I
put you in a difficult situation.

20:41.278 --> 20:45.518
Are you with that I can
sign up to be a threat?

20:45.598 --> 20:48.558
I have not threatened anyone.
They're after me.

20:48.638 --> 20:52.357
If you do not stop, I
download attendants.

20:52.437 --> 20:54.437
Listen carefully.

20:54.517 --> 21:00.357
I know them and know how they act.
We can not trust anyone here.

21:00.437 --> 21:03.477
Why do you even bother?

21:04.837 --> 21:09.677
- It's about what I have to.
- I do not want to hear more.

21:09.757 --> 21:15.197
When I am back, I will pretend
we never had this conversation.

21:15.277 --> 21:18.277
- Gretchen...
- That's enough, I said.

21:18.357 --> 21:20.317
You'll have to trust me.

21:20.397 --> 21:23.996
Generate master you?

21:24.076 --> 21:29.436
No, he has just gotten a little
too much to drink. Excuse me.

21:32.396 --> 21:34.396
Champagne.

21:34.476 --> 21:37.036
What are we celebrating?

21:53.515 --> 21:55.315
Hello?

21:57.595 --> 21:59.755
Are you okay?

22:09.755 --> 22:12.715
- Have you missed me?
- If I have.

22:12.795 --> 22:15.035
What a beautiful hairstyle.

22:16.875 --> 22:21.395
- I told you it was great.
- I ask nicely.

22:21.475 --> 22:24.274
- It was not very nice?
- Where is it?

22:24.354 --> 22:29.194
The coffee machine? The I threw
out with the rest of your junk.

22:29.274 --> 22:32.514
- That's how I remember it.
- Where?

22:32.594 --> 22:37.714
Unfortunately, the aircraft not in the air
long enough for you when you find it.

22:37.794 --> 22:39.554
Terry?

22:41.834 --> 22:44.234
The plane is ours now.

23:30.552 --> 23:34.312
- Nothing.
- I'm not an idiot, Sharpe.

23:34.392 --> 23:36.912
Look here. Valentino.

23:37.632 --> 23:42.272
- Canali, Savile Row.
- doubt you my taste?

23:43.752 --> 23:49.712
Your taste is the problem itself, Terry.
You must always show you.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.512
How do you think we found you?

23:52.592 --> 23:54.912
Lesson no. 1:

23:54.992 --> 23:59.391
If you want to cheat someone, make
sure that they do not survive.

23:59.471 --> 24:01.751
It is you the expert.

24:02.871 --> 24:08.191
Realize that you were greedy. One man
can not possibly spend that much money.

24:11.751 --> 24:17.631
Congratulations, you got me. But what
is the 10,000 meters in the air?

24:17.711 --> 24:20.471
I have run out of a row.

24:24.911 --> 24:27.391
This is not a getaway car.

24:27.471 --> 24:33.670
Should I get the plane to change course,
the Air Force just shoot us down.

24:33.750 --> 24:39.190
I agree with you, but
first they must find us.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.630
What should I do with it?

25:00.830 --> 25:04.669
- Hey sweety.
- Are you old enough to fly himself?

25:04.749 --> 25:06.989
- What do you want?
- Coffee.

25:07.069 --> 25:09.109
I'll take a soda.

25:09.189 --> 25:13.469
- You have not worked here before.
- Then you would be able to remember it.

25:13.549 --> 25:15.949
I believe it.

25:37.428 --> 25:41.788
- Do you tell it?
- She should have let it go.

25:41.868 --> 25:45.228
It is difficult when there
is a billion at stake.

25:50.708 --> 25:56.108
I let you keep your legs Sharpe.
You should have taken them on the neck.

25:57.388 --> 26:00.668
Now I have to listen to
your advice and kill you.

26:00.748 --> 26:03.828
What do you imagine, Terry?

26:03.908 --> 26:07.107
But I must admit that you
are a skilled thief.

26:07.187 --> 26:10.467
Unfortunately, you do not know
how to hold on to things.

26:46.226 --> 26:51.626
The price is like for my children's schooling
stay, but you can get a glass of water?

27:00.226 --> 27:02.826
Is there anybody?

27:04.666 --> 27:09.345
Frankly? Gold Member, I just...

27:13.505 --> 27:15.705
It does not end like this.

27:15.785 --> 27:21.265
- Save it for dullen first class.
- You are still happy for me.

27:26.865 --> 27:30.505
I attack might this
from the wrong angle.

27:32.905 --> 27:37.945
- I do not even know who she is.
- That we have to find out.

27:50.144 --> 27:52.824
Pardon? Hello?

28:00.104 --> 28:02.104
Pardon?

28:20.343 --> 28:22.463
Oh God!

28:47.582 --> 28:49.542
You again.

28:50.502 --> 28:54.582
- You never told what your name was.
- Gretchen Blair, FBI agent.

28:54.662 --> 28:59.462
- My name is Luke Byres.
- You are Air Marshal.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.622
How do you know that?

29:01.702 --> 29:06.742
Be careful how you carry your weapon.
You revealed yourself.

29:06.822 --> 29:10.302
Never mind. Listen carefully.

29:12.462 --> 29:15.581
I think that the plane has been hijacked.

29:18.101 --> 29:19.941
Luke?

29:22.181 --> 29:24.901
The plane has been hijacked.

29:27.301 --> 29:31.021
- Have they threatened you?
- I do not know.

29:31.101 --> 29:34.341
There is a death flight out back.

29:41.461 --> 29:46.860
- Is this your first crisis?
- It's only my third trip.

29:51.060 --> 29:55.020
I should have secured
the cabin and cockpit.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.940
Wait, do not drink it there.

29:58.020 --> 30:01.180
There can be hijackers
between staff.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.540
What nonsense!

30:09.620 --> 30:12.260
Stop complaining you.

30:12.340 --> 30:15.060
He said nothing about
the girl uniforms.

30:15.140 --> 30:19.979
As if that makes any difference.
You look like anyway Gene Simmons.

30:26.379 --> 30:29.419
709 here. We are seeing some bad weather.

30:29.499 --> 30:33.859
- Requesting to go down to 8,500 m.
- Perceived, Speedbird 709th

30:33.939 --> 30:36.339
Go down to 8,500 and stay there.

30:44.819 --> 30:48.618
We need to provide the master
message and divert the aircraft.

30:48.698 --> 30:50.858
I will come along.

32:00.816 --> 32:03.536
I thought Sharpe could fly.

32:03.616 --> 32:05.976
He knows what he's doing.

32:09.576 --> 32:11.896
And what is it?

32:12.936 --> 32:17.096
He makes sure that
passengers collaborations.

32:27.775 --> 32:30.655
Here is your captain.

32:30.735 --> 32:36.615
We experienced a drop in cabin pressure.
There is nothing to worry about.

32:36.695 --> 32:40.375
Stay seated and keep
oxygen masks on -

32:40.455 --> 32:44.935
- then comes the staff
around and look for you.

32:46.855 --> 32:49.975
They do not belong staff.

32:52.975 --> 32:56.374
Will someone tell what
the hell is going on?

32:57.374 --> 33:00.294
Remain in your seat.

33:01.694 --> 33:04.294
- What are you doing?
- A security check.

33:04.374 --> 33:06.454
It's my bag!

33:07.054 --> 33:12.814
Sit down before I run my fist up your ass!
Understood?

33:16.734 --> 33:21.254
- What's he looking for?
- What do you think? A bomb!

33:21.334 --> 33:25.613
- Nothing happens, the captain said.
- Do you think they would tell it?

33:25.693 --> 33:30.813
- They may have explosives on board.
- No, they are not terrorists.

33:30.893 --> 33:36.053
- I'm sure the cockpit.
- They've already taken it!

33:36.133 --> 33:38.533
Listen carefully.

33:38.613 --> 33:44.613
There is nothing on the plane as they
want, and we must find it before them.

33:44.693 --> 33:49.853
The guy who sat next to me offered
me a large sum to help themselves.

33:49.933 --> 33:52.213
We'll have to find him first.

33:52.293 --> 33:55.173
Can you fix the steward?

33:56.253 --> 34:00.852
- Yes, I can. What do you want to do?
- I do not know.

34:39.291 --> 34:40.971
It was fucking...

34:41.051 --> 34:46.251
Stay calm and stay seated.
It is a routine control.

34:46.331 --> 34:48.170
Air Marshal!

35:07.210 --> 35:10.250
- Terry?
- I did not know you felt that way.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.170
We'll have to hurry.

35:15.650 --> 35:19.050
- Now I have you.
- Is that your ex?

35:19.130 --> 35:22.970
- I assume it was a tough break.
- You have no idea.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.050
Hullo!

36:04.608 --> 36:06.288
Sharpe?

36:10.608 --> 36:13.288
- What is going on?
- Partially off the power.

36:13.368 --> 36:16.608
- Okay, I'm coming out.
- Do not be silly.

36:16.688 --> 36:20.408
Stay there and lock the door.
Say, how do I turn it back on.

36:48.527 --> 36:50.647
Where is he?

36:56.167 --> 37:00.487
- I'll talk to the captain.
- Sit.

37:02.007 --> 37:06.246
- He must have slipped past.
- We're on a plane, fool!

37:06.326 --> 37:09.046
- Sit down, everyone!
- Sit.

37:10.126 --> 37:13.926
- He must be here somewhere.
- Do you think so?

37:14.006 --> 37:17.246
So find him though!

37:18.246 --> 37:21.366
I had one job, fools.

37:21.446 --> 37:25.486
- Take the stitches now!
- But the captain said we...

37:25.566 --> 37:28.606
Remove the mask now.

38:05.645 --> 38:07.725
Let's go.

38:12.204 --> 38:15.684
- Hello! Show me your face.
- She can not breathe.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.964
Leave her alone!

38:24.444 --> 38:28.764
Can you see the light on? So it goes -

38:28.844 --> 38:32.364
- when I do not get to your seats.

38:38.764 --> 38:40.643
Agent Blair.

38:42.163 --> 38:44.563
You should have a kick in the ass.

38:44.643 --> 38:48.043
I knew I could trust you.
Down!

38:51.243 --> 38:55.523
Was the agreement is not
that you had to save me?

39:04.323 --> 39:06.363
We have no deal.

39:21.122 --> 39:26.082
If you need a little time alone,
you should have just asked.

39:28.922 --> 39:31.162
What is the plan?

39:31.242 --> 39:36.362
My security is involved,
so my arms are checked in.

39:36.442 --> 39:39.482
So we have to find my bag.

39:42.202 --> 39:44.561
Give me your hands.

39:49.441 --> 39:52.321
All passengers must be checked.

39:57.801 --> 40:00.561
Up with your hands.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.320
Show me your hands.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.240
- Where is the man who sat here?
- I do not know.

40:36.320 --> 40:38.320
Where is he?

40:40.840 --> 40:45.480
Where is the man who sat here?
Who knows or has seen anything?

40:47.239 --> 40:50.079
Where the hell is he?

41:00.199 --> 41:03.199
Have you broken arms?

41:03.279 --> 41:05.759
- Oh yeah.
- Thank you.

41:06.839 --> 41:09.839
- What kind of bag is it?
- A Fendi.

41:09.919 --> 41:13.759
- You lack certainly not money.
- It is a bad copy.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.478
Matthew?

41:35.558 --> 41:38.678
- So what?
- No sign of them yet.

41:38.758 --> 41:40.918
No trace?

41:40.998 --> 41:44.758
Hell, Sadie! We're on a plane.

41:44.838 --> 41:47.598
Is that how you talk to me now?

41:49.557 --> 41:51.957
No sorry.

41:52.037 --> 41:55.797
Well. Fly the plane, so I'll do it here.

42:14.357 --> 42:17.637
Check under the seats and in the toilet.

42:17.717 --> 42:21.196
Led anywhere on the plane. Find him!

42:24.876 --> 42:27.996
What the hell is this?

42:28.076 --> 42:30.556
Move!

42:44.916 --> 42:47.756
- Fuck!
- Say it's a lie.

42:47.836 --> 42:51.316
- What happened to you?
- I do not know.

42:51.396 --> 42:54.475
- They were right here.
- Say it's a lie!

42:57.035 --> 43:00.915
- Do I have a mark here?
- No, that's fine.

43:02.715 --> 43:05.275
- Damn!
- Are you okay?

43:05.355 --> 43:09.435
- I'm just having a break.
- Did you hurt yourself? Let me see.

43:11.195 --> 43:12.955
Here.

43:23.474 --> 43:27.514
How do you think it is
to fly first class?

43:27.594 --> 43:31.674
Fantastic. Exactly as
I had imagined it.

43:37.194 --> 43:39.594
Who are you?

43:40.354 --> 43:43.034
- Pardon?
- Who the hell are you?

43:43.114 --> 43:47.394
How do you know these people from?
How are you involved?

43:51.034 --> 43:54.793
- I was their partner.
- So you worked together?

43:54.873 --> 43:56.953
With what?

43:57.033 --> 43:59.833
As freelancers, if you
have to put it nicely.

43:59.913 --> 44:05.233
- So you're all criminals.
- I prefer my description.

44:05.313 --> 44:07.513
This is not a joke.

44:07.593 --> 44:11.833
- I arrest you when we land.
- But first we countries.

44:11.913 --> 44:16.033
Should I mention all the illegal
acts you have committed on board?

44:16.113 --> 44:19.313
It is not me who is the villain here.

44:19.393 --> 44:22.633
Think that you believe in that stuff.

44:22.713 --> 44:27.072
But to be honest, you have
not told me anything.

44:33.352 --> 44:36.632
- It was the perfect plan.
- Yes, obviously.

44:36.712 --> 44:39.872
It was a damn good plan.

44:43.872 --> 44:48.272
I was the one who created the trust.
The man in the suit.

44:48.352 --> 44:53.392
I could figure out where the money
was less than five minutes.

44:53.472 --> 44:55.632
Sharpe...

44:56.712 --> 45:01.231
He looks like a bully, but
his brain is razor sharp.

45:01.311 --> 45:04.791
All machines that have
ever been built -

45:04.871 --> 45:09.591
- he can disassemble and
reassemble with his bare hands.

45:09.671 --> 45:15.231
But he lays hands on people,
the result is quite different.

45:15.311 --> 45:17.991
And as for my...

45:19.631 --> 45:21.711
... ex...

45:22.511 --> 45:25.271
... Sadie is the one who has balls.

45:25.351 --> 45:29.430
Balls? Nicely said.

45:44.470 --> 45:47.350
Go down there, Lennox.

45:47.430 --> 45:50.030
I want him alive.

45:50.110 --> 45:53.670
- And the woman?
- Hugs her.

45:55.790 --> 45:57.430
Down!

46:04.949 --> 46:08.989
- Stop, it hurts!
- Shut up or I'll kill you.

46:13.789 --> 46:16.029
Is there anyone at home?

46:16.949 --> 46:19.909
- You'll have to quit.
- With what?

46:19.989 --> 46:23.469
To finish my sentences.
People think that we're married.

46:26.509 --> 46:28.709
They saw us not shown.

46:31.149 --> 46:33.428
Thank God.

46:33.508 --> 46:36.028
I just spotted my suitcase.

46:36.108 --> 46:38.388
- Can you reach to it?
- Yes.

46:38.468 --> 46:41.348
Just keep looking.

46:43.268 --> 46:45.748
Let me know if they come.

46:52.348 --> 46:54.148
I have it.

46:56.588 --> 46:58.308
Damn...

46:58.388 --> 47:01.188
- What?
- Magazine.

47:05.187 --> 47:07.027
Wait a minute.

47:17.387 --> 47:19.347
Come on.

47:22.707 --> 47:24.587
Now I have you!

48:38.144 --> 48:42.344
I am not so easy to impress,
but it was damn cool.

48:44.864 --> 48:47.224
Gretchen?

48:48.304 --> 48:51.224
- What are you doing?
- Show it to me.

48:51.304 --> 48:56.224
- What?
- What is worth to hijack a plane.

49:41.262 --> 49:45.422
- It is here.
- What the hell is that?

49:45.502 --> 49:49.022
The last place anyone would look.

49:49.582 --> 49:52.102
WARNING! DANGEROUS GOODS!

50:00.782 --> 50:02.582
What is it taking so long?

50:17.061 --> 50:19.221
Stand still.

50:22.381 --> 50:24.781
Start walking.

50:24.861 --> 50:29.581
- What had you imagined?
- You need to get me into the cockpit.

50:33.421 --> 50:37.021
The advantage with the biological material, -

50:37.101 --> 50:41.701
- is that you do not investigate
it, because it can cause...

50:41.781 --> 50:45.020
- Tissue damage.
- Exactly.

51:00.020 --> 51:01.780
Ask him open.

51:01.860 --> 51:06.740
- You can still pull you out.
- Shut up and bit him open.

51:06.820 --> 51:11.460
- How much is he paying you?
- I mean it.

51:24.459 --> 51:28.659
You have no idea how long
I've prepared this coup.

51:30.899 --> 51:33.299
What I had to get through...

51:41.139 --> 51:45.579
... and how much dirt
I got on my hands.

51:47.578 --> 51:50.138
What's this about?

51:53.698 --> 51:57.938
- How much is it worth?
- Something with ten digits.

51:58.018 --> 51:59.778
Joe's...

52:02.258 --> 52:06.258
So you snowed your companions?
Is that how you do?

52:06.338 --> 52:09.898
You really do not have
high thoughts about me.

52:10.738 --> 52:14.138
Those up there, my companions...

52:15.138 --> 52:19.777
It was those who stuck me in my back.
Or closer to the stomach.

52:34.857 --> 52:37.297
What are you doing?

52:37.377 --> 52:41.217
Do you want to carry around a bucket shit?

52:56.056 --> 52:59.576
Open the door or I shoot!

53:06.736 --> 53:08.896
Matthew?

53:10.736 --> 53:12.656
You know what to do.

54:07.054 --> 54:09.974
- Are you okay?
- Yes i am fine.

54:10.054 --> 54:13.454
But I can not get free.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.854
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm just sitting firmly.

54:28.853 --> 54:30.973
Terry?

54:35.293 --> 54:38.253
- He'll be back.
- No, do not...

54:38.333 --> 54:40.453
You are safe here.

54:43.533 --> 54:45.373
Do not.

54:45.453 --> 54:47.453
Terry?

54:51.413 --> 54:53.733
Terry!

54:58.732 --> 55:00.812
Byres.

55:02.132 --> 55:05.932
The aircraft is secured.
It is safe to go up there.

55:10.692 --> 55:13.932
I knew you were a
good investment.

55:15.652 --> 55:20.092
I'm sorry, Terry. You are
bad at choosing partners.

56:31.169 --> 56:36.169
- Where is your little companion?
- Your goons came first.

56:36.249 --> 56:40.009
It does not matter.
She dies anyway down there.

56:41.649 --> 56:45.009
709, you are on 4500
m and wane yet.

56:45.089 --> 56:47.889
In the case of an emergency?

56:47.969 --> 56:52.969
- I redirect you now.
- No. The hydraulic system is not working.

56:55.849 --> 56:58.969
- Is that...?
- Keep your eyes on the road.

57:07.608 --> 57:09.968
It is here you will definitely like to see.

59:38.884 --> 59:41.123
It was almost as
good as bad sex.

59:49.763 --> 59:51.803
It is okay.

01:00:02.563 --> 01:00:05.763
Thank you, my God. Thank God.

01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:15.800
This is your captain.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:21.160
I regret the hard landing.
We had to stopover.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:25.200
I hope everyone is okay.
Our mechanics checking the plane now.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.960
Let them do their work, we
are soon on the wings again.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.440
We facilitate on six minutes.
Neither more nor less.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.960
I'll fix it in five.

01:01:51.719 --> 01:01:55.799
Sit down and keep your mouth shut!

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:59.359
Do not give me a reason to kill you!

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:17.157
It would have worked, Sharpe.

01:03:18.877 --> 01:03:21.196
What did you say, Terry?

01:03:22.356 --> 01:03:26.876
We could be let go.
This is unnecessary.

01:03:28.996 --> 01:03:33.996
"Even the best plan can go skewed.
- I worked for it for seven years.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:36.476
It was the perfect plan.

01:03:37.436 --> 01:03:41.876
"And yet we are sitting here.
- You no longer reach.

01:03:41.956 --> 01:03:44.596
There is no resort.

01:03:46.516 --> 01:03:52.035
Those we stole the bag from
can never go to the police.

01:03:52.835 --> 01:03:58.155
It does not exist. But you stole a
flight of 200 passengers on board.

01:04:00.355 --> 01:04:04.235
It can not be hidden.
They will look for you everywhere.

01:04:06.715 --> 01:04:08.955
They are not going to lead at all.

01:04:14.035 --> 01:04:16.715
We all want to be dead.

01:04:19.315 --> 01:04:22.954
Full speed! I will not be on
board while it facilitates.

01:04:34.554 --> 01:04:39.034
When they search the wreckage,
they find all occupants.

01:04:45.034 --> 01:04:47.194
Even Sadie and me.

01:05:01.433 --> 01:05:04.393
The black box. The recordings.

01:05:07.513 --> 01:05:11.953
- They find out what has happened.
- You know what...

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:17.753
It is the beauty of it here.

01:05:22.513 --> 01:05:24.753
The aircraft will be my chief witness.

01:05:28.152 --> 01:05:32.832
The mechanics are in the process
of installing a dummy -

01:05:32.912 --> 01:05:35.432
- that will tell something else.

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:45.872
Officially got off the plane just
problems with the hydraulics.

01:05:47.952 --> 01:05:49.992
In with it.

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:53.152
- How long time?
- Three minutes.

01:06:01.471 --> 01:06:05.351
Speed. We facilitate two minutes.

01:06:06.751 --> 01:06:11.911
Your share is located at the door. Let
it open, but seal the cargo hold.

01:06:11.991 --> 01:06:14.071
Let's get out of here.

01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:23.631
- Close the door!
- The hatch...

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:46.590
I must give you, Sharpe...

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.270
I thought I was the
cleverest criminal.

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.670
But you really...

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.350
... the wildest supervillain.

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.109
Do not try to flatter me.

01:07:47.668 --> 01:07:51.348
- Are they finished?
- We're ready to go, Captain.

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:31.947
Come on! Let's just!

01:08:38.986 --> 01:08:42.066
You are really good people.

01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:44.786
Come on. I need your help.

01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:53.706
- Press start!
- Corrects I did not stop, we can not facilitate.

01:09:05.586 --> 01:09:09.104
Come on. Flyværtinden help you.

01:09:09.185 --> 01:09:11.425
She helps you.

01:09:14.385 --> 01:09:16.505
Stand up in a row.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.745
You must help me to get
people off the plane.

01:09:27.265 --> 01:09:29.385
Keep calm.

01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:51.624
Are you kidding me?

01:09:58.224 --> 01:10:00.784
Come on! Up on the series.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.344
Give me your hand. Come on!

01:10:23.223 --> 01:10:25.063
Give me your hand.

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:39.863
Come on!

01:10:42.862 --> 01:10:44.782
You first.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.422
Spring!

01:10:57.142 --> 01:10:59.182
Come on!

01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:44.580
- It ends here, agent.
- Luke?

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.340
- Hands up.
- What are you doing?

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:53.540
Where are you going?
Looking for Terry?

01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.340
Put the gun.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.140
How much he offered you?
10 million?

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:02.780
Your asshole...

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.260
Luxury Yacht magazine?

01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:07.100
Fuck you!

01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:09.060
20 million?

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.700
More? 20 or 30?

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:14.140
- A little more.
- The bastard!

01:12:22.579 --> 01:12:26.259
Luke, we have sworn to protect people.

01:12:26.339 --> 01:12:30.099
You know as well as I do that
there is no money in it!

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:33.739
- I do not care about money.
- But I'm not.

01:12:45.459 --> 01:12:47.818
Come on, dammit!

01:13:38.937 --> 01:13:41.297
- How long time?
- Three minutes.

01:13:52.376 --> 01:13:55.776
The control tower here.
We have found the missing aircraft.

01:13:55.856 --> 01:13:57.856
In the 900 meters.

01:14:02.896 --> 01:14:05.056
Speedbird 709, came.

01:15:56.612 --> 01:15:58.612
Sadie!

01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:24.532
Sorry sweetie.

01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:31.371
You do not belong up here.

01:16:37.851 --> 01:16:40.691
You do not, bitch!

01:16:49.291 --> 01:16:51.131
Terry!

01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:57.131
- We'd better get going.
- The second parachute is gone.

01:16:57.211 --> 01:17:00.570
- Do you have a good excuse?
- Shut up.

01:17:03.810 --> 01:17:05.690
Now we slip away.

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:18.930
Here, take it.

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:22.770
- I have it.
- Ready?

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:30.009
- Yes.
- Spring!

01:17:47.409 --> 01:17:49.169
Damn!

01:18:17.608 --> 01:18:20.048
You never answered.

01:18:20.648 --> 01:18:22.688
On what?

01:18:23.528 --> 01:18:25.728
Let me take it there.

01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:31.608
- Be careful where you put your hand.
- Pardon...

01:18:32.727 --> 01:18:34.807
Never responded to what?

01:18:35.527 --> 01:18:38.127
Paris.

01:18:38.207 --> 01:18:42.567
Do you mean it?
There is a little far to walk.

01:18:42.647 --> 01:18:44.927
We have enough time.

01:18:46.007 --> 01:18:50.487
It takes weeks before they discover
that we were not on the plane.

01:18:50.567 --> 01:18:52.887
If they do it...

01:18:56.047 --> 01:18:58.447
So what do you say?

01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:08.846
Let's get down to the first.

01:20:10.564 --> 01:20:14.124
