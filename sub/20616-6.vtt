WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:13.145
It's another dimension.

00:13.147 --> 00:16.181
The energy is insane.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.350
It's attacking my kids.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.486
The threat level is high.

00:22.055 --> 00:24.189
He was found with his head
blowed off with a shotgun.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.193
He met with
an unfortunate accident.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.395
I can't sleep.
I can't do anything.

00:30.397 --> 00:33.632
This is a very bad space.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.135
This is not a good situation.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.036
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.605
There's death here.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.340
Don't wanna go down there.

00:41.342 --> 00:42.608
I see dead people.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.710
They hide in the walls
and they watch.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.379
I speak to dead people...

00:47.381 --> 00:50.215
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.084
...and they speak to me.

00:52.086 --> 00:54.219
She's going to torture them.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.956
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.092
They were all murdered.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.593
I rely on my partner.

01:01.595 --> 01:03.262
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.995
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.732
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:07.734 --> 01:11.302
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.304 --> 01:15.307
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:15.309 --> 01:17.009
It's my job to reveal them.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.644
Who do you think
possessed you?

01:18.646 --> 01:20.813
But Steve and I
never speak...

01:20.815 --> 01:22.881
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.115
...until the very end.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.717
Well, you're not gonna want
to see this.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.819
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:27.821 --> 01:29.388
<i>Hell,</i> no.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.956
Or time to get out.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.991
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:47.674 --> 01:49.141
I'm in Slaughters, Kentucky.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.276
It's a tiny town
with a strange name,

01:51.278 --> 01:53.278
about 2 hours north
of Nashville.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.947
I got a call
from a woman named Holly.

01:54.949 --> 01:56.948
Now, she says whatever
is in her house

01:56.950 --> 01:58.750
already wrecked her marriage

01:58.752 --> 02:00.953
and now it's going after
her kids.

02:00.955 --> 02:03.021
She's really praying we can
help her out.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.560
Before Amy arrives,
I clear the house

02:08.562 --> 02:11.029
of any leading information.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.967
Photographs, religious texts,

02:14.969 --> 02:18.169
even dream catchers
can influence her findings,

02:18.171 --> 02:21.707
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:21.709 --> 02:25.244
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.856
Wow.

02:38.858 --> 02:41.593
Dreams -- big issue here.

02:41.595 --> 02:45.396
There's a thing in the dreams
people experience,

02:45.398 --> 02:49.067
and it's not good.

02:49.069 --> 02:51.269
And the thing about the dreams

02:51.271 --> 02:53.872
is that you can't
fully remember,

02:53.874 --> 02:57.242
like, everything that happens,
but it's super bad.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.013
I'm not sure about this yet,

03:01.015 --> 03:05.216
but if it is taking
living energy from people,

03:05.218 --> 03:06.552
in the end, they would die.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.893
You know, Holly,
I speak to a lot of people

03:14.895 --> 03:16.361
who really want us
to come investigate,

03:16.363 --> 03:17.696
but when I spoke to you,

03:17.698 --> 03:21.633
the sound of desperation
was...through the roof.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.302
It is. We've been living
with this for a lot of years,

03:24.304 --> 03:26.804
and it's just getting worse,

03:26.806 --> 03:28.507
and it's time to do
something about it

03:28.509 --> 03:29.708
'cause I can't do it
anymore.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.643
I can't protect everybody.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.712
Now on the phone, you said
that whatever is going on here

03:33.714 --> 03:35.046
wrecked your marriage.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.614
How long have you guys
been separated?

03:36.616 --> 03:37.816
About 2 years.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.184
Who else is living here?

03:39.186 --> 03:41.953
Well, here's a picture.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.155
This is Frank.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.990
Okay. So what's the story
with Frank?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.658
He's been a good friend
of ours.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.159
You guys aren't boyfriend
and girlfriend?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.994
No, mnh-mnh. No, just
a real good friend.

03:49.996 --> 03:51.730
He's like a rock.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.032
Okay. Who else
is in the picture?

03:54.034 --> 03:55.667
That's my son, Ryan.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.536
- He's 11.
- Okay.

03:57.538 --> 04:02.474
Me, and my daughter, Tila,
she's 24, and her fiancÃ©, John.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.442
He's 28.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.744
Tell me what you guys
are going through.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.912
Well, we're hearing voices.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.682
We're seeing shadow figures.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.418
People are having
health problems, you know,

04:13.420 --> 04:17.889
physical attacks
and personality changes.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.224
When you say
personality changes,

04:19.226 --> 04:21.091
you talking about
your husband?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.296
Yes. Sean was
a very fun-loving man.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.431
He was happy.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.434
And, just, he became...

04:29.436 --> 04:31.636
mean.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.171
He'd pick fights with me.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.707
If Amy comes right out
and says,

04:35.709 --> 04:40.845
"Listen, the paranormal in this
house caused Sean to change,"

04:40.847 --> 04:44.182
would you consider, then, maybe
trying to get back with him?

04:44.184 --> 04:46.685
I still love him,
but I don't know.

04:46.687 --> 04:50.522
A lot has been said and done
that's very painful.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.723
What do you think is here?

04:51.725 --> 04:53.925
I think that there's
something very dark.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.794
I think it's something evil.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.408
This is wrong.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.743
I heard "chaos."

05:11.745 --> 05:14.146
I heard a fight in here
between two living people.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.950
And I see a male,

05:18.952 --> 05:23.020
and he's extremely upset,

05:23.022 --> 05:25.890
and he's over this...

05:25.892 --> 05:28.527
I'm assuming, a woman,
yelling at her.

05:30.097 --> 05:34.432
She's crying,
and he's just going off,

05:34.434 --> 05:36.100
yelling, yelling, yelling.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.603
Woman's freaking out,
crying, crying, crying.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.510
All right. So what's
going on in this room?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.112
One day, I walked in here.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.847
I was super frustrated,

05:48.849 --> 05:52.384
and, I said, out loud,

05:52.386 --> 05:54.286
"I sure ain't gonna
stay here,"

05:54.288 --> 05:56.321
and I heard this voice,
like, right here,

05:56.323 --> 05:58.990
right next to me, "Why?"

05:58.992 --> 06:01.126
It was a male voice,
just as plain as day,

06:01.128 --> 06:02.260
like somebody
was standing there,

06:02.262 --> 06:03.462
but there was nobody there.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.130
Was the radio on,
maybe something else

06:05.132 --> 06:06.598
that could've made
that noise?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.299
No, there was nothing on.

06:08.301 --> 06:11.002
That's a little creepy.
Have you ever heard that again?

06:11.004 --> 06:14.539
Yes. He tries to talk
to me, calls my name.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.074
All right.
So anything else?

06:16.076 --> 06:20.211
When I'm here, I feel
sickness and, um, despair.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.147
Describe the despair
you feel.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.882
The other day --
I'll give you an example.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.082
I'm cleaning in here

06:25.084 --> 06:27.819
and I started feeling
really depressed,

06:27.821 --> 06:30.288
and I just felt like,
"Jeez, what's it all worth?"

06:30.290 --> 06:32.757
and just, out of the blue,
just started to cry.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.893
You also mentioned sickness.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.362
I have pain in my stomach,
generally on the right side.

06:38.364 --> 06:41.032
It's stabbing, like I'm being
stabbed with something.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.967
And how are you feeling,
now that we're in here?

06:42.969 --> 06:44.468
It hurts.

06:44.470 --> 06:48.039
It's just pushing,
pushing real hard.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.975
Okay.

06:53.647 --> 06:54.980
Ew.

06:56.516 --> 07:00.385
Don't like this place.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.719
It's almost
like you walk in here,

07:01.721 --> 07:05.624
and it's just
squishing you down.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.058
I don't like it in there.

07:07.060 --> 07:12.096
Ä°t's <i> bad</i> in there.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.400
I feel nauseous, sick...

07:15.402 --> 07:18.370
And dizzy.

07:18.372 --> 07:21.706
Like, when I say dizzy, like,
this is...intense dizziness.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.378
There's no ground here at all.

07:26.380 --> 07:32.617
I feel like the living, if they
spend time in this area,

07:32.619 --> 07:36.821
would become
extraordinarily depressed.

07:36.823 --> 07:39.590
They would lose time in here.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.627
That's the thing here is, like,
dreams and reality,

07:42.629 --> 07:45.330
there's, like, no line here.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.799
This is a very bad space.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.107
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

07:56.109 --> 07:57.776
One night, when I come up
to go to bed,

07:57.778 --> 08:00.178
I'd seen a shadow figure,
humped out,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.780
kind of leaning over like it
was gonna get on the bed.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.216
What did it do?

08:04.218 --> 08:06.517
It turned quick to look at me
and then just disappeared.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.319
All right.
So anything else?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.987
I hear my door open,

08:09.989 --> 08:13.391
and I see this shadow
of a man peeking in.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.593
Okay, so it looks like
the shadow figure you see.

08:15.595 --> 08:16.595
Sometimes.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.863
What do you mean
"sometimes"?

08:17.865 --> 08:20.732
Sometimes, it'd look like
Sean, my husband.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.201
- Is he here?
- No, no.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.403
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.006
I went and checked.
Nobody was here.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.908
How the hell
do you sleep here?

08:29.910 --> 08:31.576
Well, I have nightmares.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.178
What kind of nightmares?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.212
Always
fighting something evil.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.214
I've always remembered
all of my dreams.

08:37.216 --> 08:41.885
These here
are very, very bad.

08:41.888 --> 08:44.355
I love my home,
but I sometimes

08:44.357 --> 08:46.091
just don't even want to
be here anymore.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.926
Okay.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.563
There's a thing that's
giving everyone nightmares.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.767
I think that thing is
on the ceiling.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.168
Can you describe it?

08:57.170 --> 08:58.703
The closest thing
would be, like,

08:58.705 --> 09:01.773
a cross between a little dragon
and a gargoyle,

09:01.775 --> 09:05.176
but it has the long arms, like,
the spider arms.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.446
How would the living experience
the dream state from this thing?

09:08.448 --> 09:10.315
Like they're having a dream,

09:10.317 --> 09:13.685
but the experiences they're
having in the dream are real,

09:13.687 --> 09:17.489
so the whole thing gets
all kinds of crazy and fuzzy

09:17.491 --> 09:20.558
in their head as far as
what's real, what's not real.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.563
I wouldn't want to stay here.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.151
So, Ryan, how old are you?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.119
-11.
- It seems like everybody

09:48.121 --> 09:49.654
is having experiences
in the house.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.289
Now what about you?

09:54.461 --> 09:57.329
He had a hat on,
like a war hat.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.530
Could you see through
this person,

09:58.532 --> 09:59.864
or was this somebody
that was...

09:59.866 --> 10:01.399
He was black.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.701
Did you think it was
a dream?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.002
No.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.203
Okay, Ryan.
Anything else?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.738
I get tired.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.339
What do you think
it could be?

10:08.341 --> 10:11.910
He's trying to make me go
to sleep and give me nightmares.

10:11.912 --> 10:15.212
Okay, so you think it could be
that man you saw.

10:15.214 --> 10:16.547
Yeah.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.616
So, Ryan, how would you feel
if we were able to get

10:18.618 --> 10:20.651
all the bad spirits
out of the house?

10:20.653 --> 10:22.821
I think it would make
my family feel better,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.289
and I think the air
would let up.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.758
Okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.664
It feels like I'm on

10:32.666 --> 10:34.766
the teacup ride

10:34.768 --> 10:36.934
when it spins like crazy.

10:36.936 --> 10:41.373
The energy
is...insane in this room.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.974
It's super bad.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.310
Nobody should go in this room.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.645
I think the living are seeing it
as a shadow person,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.047
but it's not.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.515
It's that...that thing is,

10:50.517 --> 10:53.718
the dragon/gargoyle thing.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.720
Then it gets really little

10:55.722 --> 10:59.090
and it crawls down
the closet door.

10:59.092 --> 11:03.528
It is affecting the living
here, where a child sleeps.

11:03.530 --> 11:06.197
That thing enters
people's dreams,

11:06.199 --> 11:10.068
but they don't necessarily
have to be completely asleep.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.669
It scares the kid.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.839
This thing is just
taking his energy.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.908
What is this?

11:23.150 --> 11:24.816
So, Frank, I was talking
to Holly today.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.719
She was telling me about all
the stuff going on here.

11:27.721 --> 11:30.021
Now she said that you guys
have been friends a long time.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.455
Yeah, about 6 years.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.490
Nothing romantic
with you and her.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.959
No, no, just friends.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.828
Okay, so I know everybody is
having experiences in the house.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.831
- How about you?
- I have a lot of chest pains.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.367
Can you describe how you're
feeling with these chest pains?

11:42.369 --> 11:45.302
I got a stab right here,
right through.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.438
It's funny you mention
a stabbing pain

11:47.440 --> 11:49.907
'cause Holly told me about
a stabbing pain she gets.

11:49.909 --> 11:51.442
Yeah.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.710
Do you think it's paranormal,
you having these problems?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.779
I think so, because when
I leave here, they go away.

11:54.781 --> 11:55.980
Anything else?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.849
I've been pushed down
the stairs, once.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.051
Okay. Did you get hurt?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.386
I grabbed the rail beside me

12:02.388 --> 12:04.588
and put my hand on
the wall in front of me.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.191
So you didn't make it
down the stairs.
No.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.192
So you're pretty lucky.
You could have got killed.
Yeah.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.233
I feel like I'm being hit
on the left side,

12:15.235 --> 12:17.302
in my temple,

12:17.304 --> 12:20.204
very sharp blow
to the left temple.

12:20.206 --> 12:21.339
Um...

12:21.341 --> 12:23.274
Is that
the dragon-gargoyle thing?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.176
I think so.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.112
I think it's hitting people.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.014
Does it do
anything else physical?

12:30.016 --> 12:31.382
Yes.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.694
I was talking to your mom.
She's going through a lot.

12:43.696 --> 12:47.131
She thinks that the house
changed Sean

12:47.133 --> 12:49.233
and it destroyed
the marriage.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.568
Do you agree with that?

12:50.570 --> 12:53.904
Yeah, definitely has to do
with this house.

12:53.906 --> 12:57.809
My mom and dad, all of us
have always been really close.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.910
All right.
Now what about you?

12:58.912 --> 13:00.978
Have you had any changes
in your personality?

13:00.980 --> 13:03.181
I just feel really
depressed and tired,

13:03.183 --> 13:06.384
and I'm just not me
in this house.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.554
Seems like everybody is
having experiences in the house.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.189
Pretty confident you have?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.925
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's talk about 'em.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.526
I have these nightmares.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.962
Okay. Can you
describe the dreams?

13:17.964 --> 13:20.131
I've seen this man,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.234
and he's physically
harming me.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.335
He will choke me.

13:24.337 --> 13:27.338
He will grab my ribs,
and he always says

13:27.340 --> 13:29.974
if I tell anybody,
he's going to hurt me.

13:29.976 --> 13:33.211
I've actually had time
where I have woken up before,

13:33.213 --> 13:37.148
and I had, like,
scratches all down my neck

13:37.150 --> 13:39.550
where I guess
I had been struggling back.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.819
Okay, so you think
you did the scratches,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.421
trying to stop yourself
from being choked.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.755
Yeah.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.357
And this is happening
every night?

13:46.359 --> 13:47.792
Pretty much every night.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.294
All right.
That's no way to live.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.896
No, it's not.

13:51.898 --> 13:54.665
I just
want to be able to sleep.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.834
Yeah. It doesn't sound
like you can, honey.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.203
Yeah. I feel like
I'm the target,

13:58.205 --> 14:00.438
and that just everybody
is in the way.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.872
Okay.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.709
I don't know what I did.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.610
Anything else?

14:06.612 --> 14:09.580
I've seen this thing
crawl across my bed.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.048
Okay. I know you guys got
a lot of animals here.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.785
At that point, I didn't have
no animals in my room.

14:13.787 --> 14:15.186
So what did it look like?

14:15.188 --> 14:19.424
Like a dog, but its back legs
were, like, very deformed.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.994
Okay. That must have scared
the hell out of you.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.629
Yeah.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.598
It just wasn't
a good feeling at all.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.865
Anything else happening?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.801
Just before you got here,
I tried to lay down,

14:30.803 --> 14:35.239
and I...
my heart starts racing

14:35.241 --> 14:37.342
and I lose my breath,

14:37.344 --> 14:40.144
and it feels like
a weight's on me,

14:40.146 --> 14:42.113
and I just know
he's laying on top of me.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.584
Is it the same man
from your dreams?

14:48.288 --> 14:49.587
Okay.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.556
I can't sleep.
I can't do anything.

14:52.558 --> 14:56.894
He's following me around.
He's laying on top of me.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.430
I don't know what I did.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.132
Sweetie, you didn't do
anything.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.101
We'll get through this together
and we'll figure something out.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.835
Okay?

15:04.837 --> 15:06.437
That sound like a plan?

15:06.439 --> 15:08.906
It sounds like
a really nice one.

15:14.113 --> 15:15.613
This is horrible.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.150
I'm seeing a living person,
so I don't know

15:20.152 --> 15:22.253
if this is
the kind of possession.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.521
Like, when I think
of possession,

15:23.523 --> 15:25.789
I think of, like, a demon.

15:25.791 --> 15:31.663
This is an alien-type
possession,

15:31.665 --> 15:34.732
possibly an experiment.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.800
Is the dragon-gargoyle thing
doing this?

15:36.802 --> 15:38.870
- Yes.
- So it's an alien?

15:38.872 --> 15:40.604
Yes.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.907
How is this affecting
the living person?

15:42.909 --> 15:46.811
It's erasing that person.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.880
Like, that person
and that personality

15:48.882 --> 15:52.683
before this
does not exist anymore.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.286
They're not even, like,
human anymore.

15:57.557 --> 16:01.225
To us human beings,
these things are bad.

16:01.227 --> 16:02.560
Why?

16:02.562 --> 16:04.962
Torturing children,

16:04.964 --> 16:09.067
they possibly caused somebody
to kill themselves.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.102
They try to kill people.

16:25.001 --> 16:28.069
This town is tiny --
218 people.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.538
Everybody knows
everybody's business,

16:30.540 --> 16:32.306
so when I called
the local genealogist,

16:32.308 --> 16:34.275
she knew all about
Holly's property.

16:34.277 --> 16:36.277
Turns out, a family that
used to live there

16:36.279 --> 16:37.545
suffered some tragic deaths

16:37.547 --> 16:38.946
I'm definitely gonna want
to know about.

16:45.722 --> 16:47.421
So, Mandee, this family
that suffered

16:47.423 --> 16:49.791
right around my client's
property, who were they?

16:49.793 --> 16:52.526
It was
Sally and A.J. Couch.

16:52.528 --> 16:55.463
They actually bought
the property in 1910.

16:55.465 --> 16:57.331
Okay. Now, you said
there were some deaths.

16:57.333 --> 16:58.599
When was the first one?

16:58.601 --> 17:00.868
It was actually a few years
prior to that.

17:00.870 --> 17:03.537
They had a year-old son
that passed away.

17:03.539 --> 17:04.771
Did they have
any other kids?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.339
- Yes. They had four daughters.
- All right.

17:06.342 --> 17:08.342
So what happened after they
moved onto the land there?

17:08.344 --> 17:12.413
Everything was going good
until 1933.

17:12.415 --> 17:15.648
A.J. ended up dying at 63.

17:15.651 --> 17:16.951
He had an inflamed heart.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.054
Pretty much this whole family
had heart problems.

17:22.525 --> 17:25.593
I'm seeing a male here.

17:25.595 --> 17:26.993
He lived here,

17:26.996 --> 17:29.130
and he was probably in his 60s.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.666
And I'm also getting
that choking feeling.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.968
I cannot stop it.
I cannot swallow.

17:35.238 --> 17:36.771
And then struggling.

17:40.943 --> 17:43.177
The old man died,

17:43.179 --> 17:46.948
and he's being taken in
by these gargoyle things.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.722
He's just being wrapped
and taken in to the darkness.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.627
Okay, so Sally's lost
her baby boy and her husband.

17:59.629 --> 18:01.395
- Are there any more deaths?
- Yes.

18:01.397 --> 18:05.500
In 1938, their daughter, Lockie,
dies of a hysterectomy

18:05.502 --> 18:09.937
while she was actually
on the surgery table.

18:09.939 --> 18:12.507
And then here's
her death certificate.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.908
She was
only 40 years old.

18:13.910 --> 18:15.943
Anything else?

18:15.945 --> 18:18.178
In 1947 in August,

18:18.180 --> 18:20.248
Sally actually has
a heart attack

18:20.250 --> 18:21.816
and dies as well.

18:21.818 --> 18:23.884
You know, I always expect
to see deaths on a property,

18:23.886 --> 18:25.786
especially with people
there that long,

18:25.788 --> 18:27.855
but when you said "untimely,"
you were right.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.524
I mean, a few of these
are really sooner

18:30.526 --> 18:31.892
than it should have been.

18:34.097 --> 18:35.863
Do you know where
these dragon-gargoyle things

18:35.865 --> 18:37.398
are taking the old man?

18:37.400 --> 18:41.068
They're taking him to
this hole outside.

18:41.070 --> 18:42.603
It's very large.

18:42.605 --> 18:45.273
I think the hole
is another dimension.

18:49.279 --> 18:50.945
It's been around forever.

18:50.947 --> 18:54.282
It only lets things out
that are negative.

18:56.886 --> 19:00.020
The gargoyle came
from this hole.

19:02.692 --> 19:07.228
I think that thing
within this hole

19:07.230 --> 19:09.230
can take people.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.965
It takes the souls.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.635
So far, I've got
a client who believes

19:14.637 --> 19:16.604
the paranormal destroyed
her marriage

19:16.606 --> 19:19.940
on a property where
at least two people died.

19:19.942 --> 19:22.977
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

19:22.979 --> 19:25.646
Searching through old records,
I come across Stephen Coffman,

19:25.648 --> 19:27.982
who used to own
my client's land.

19:27.984 --> 19:30.585
Turns out his nephew and his son
were brutally murdered

19:30.587 --> 19:32.987
within 6 years of each other.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.457
I've tracked down
a local crime writer

19:36.459 --> 19:37.992
who used to be a cop.

19:37.994 --> 19:39.993
Now he says the family
never saw justice

19:39.995 --> 19:41.796
for either one
of those homicides.

19:46.069 --> 19:47.268
Well, Steve, thanks
for meeting up with me.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.669
I appreciate that.

19:48.671 --> 19:49.904
What can you tell me
about the family

19:49.906 --> 19:51.138
that owned
my client's property?

19:51.140 --> 19:53.807
Stephen Osborne Coffman

19:53.809 --> 19:57.645
inherited the property
around 1896.

19:57.647 --> 19:59.680
Okay, so take me through
the first homicide.

19:59.682 --> 20:03.250
Well, the first homicide
occurred in 1899.

20:03.252 --> 20:06.754
It involved
Oz's son, William.

20:06.756 --> 20:08.990
He was 22 years of age.

20:08.992 --> 20:12.826
He's in a bar with a friend
of his in Tennessee.

20:12.828 --> 20:14.729
A guy comes out of
the bathroom.

20:14.731 --> 20:17.097
He's 25.
His name is William Morrison.

20:17.099 --> 20:20.735
Morrison had a reputation
not only as being this thug

20:20.737 --> 20:23.371
but with a real nasty temper.

20:23.373 --> 20:27.607
He feels that the Coffman boy
tripped him.

20:27.609 --> 20:30.978
Morrison pulls out a weapon,
fires three times.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.248
The Coffman boy goes down,
and he dies.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.482
Okay, so what happens?

20:35.484 --> 20:38.452
Morrison gets convicted.

20:38.454 --> 20:41.055
About 21/2 years
into his sentence,

20:41.057 --> 20:43.124
he escapes from prison.

20:43.126 --> 20:46.727
He stays a fugitive
for almost 17 to 18 years.

20:46.729 --> 20:47.961
All right.
Now there was two murders.

20:47.963 --> 20:50.197
- Right.
- What was the second one?

20:50.199 --> 20:53.900
The second homicide was
involving Stephen's son,

20:53.902 --> 20:56.470
and his son's name
was William.

20:56.472 --> 20:57.871
- Another William.
- Another William.

20:57.873 --> 21:00.741
- Okay.
- This occurred on May 6, 1905.

21:00.743 --> 21:02.143
Okay, so what happens?

21:02.145 --> 21:05.012
Well, William is riding his
horse in Slaughters, Kentucky,

21:05.014 --> 21:09.817
and he comes upon a neighbor
by the name of Paul Campbell.

21:09.819 --> 21:11.251
- Okay.
- There is an argument,

21:11.253 --> 21:14.321
and the argument,
evidently, got pretty heated,

21:14.323 --> 21:16.957
and Paul draws a weapon

21:16.959 --> 21:19.393
and shoots William.

21:19.395 --> 21:21.095
He dies.

21:21.097 --> 21:22.629
All right. So you told me
on the phone

21:22.631 --> 21:24.632
they both got away
with murder here.
Right.

21:24.634 --> 21:25.833
So what happened
with this kid, Paul?

21:25.835 --> 21:28.035
The grand jury came back
and rendered a no bill.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.437
He's not convicted.

21:29.439 --> 21:30.871
He can walk a free man.

21:30.873 --> 21:32.239
That's
a pretty messed-up story.

21:32.241 --> 21:34.041
So the guy that owned my
client's property at the time,

21:34.043 --> 21:36.577
Stephen Coffman,
loses a nephew...

21:36.579 --> 21:38.579
...and a son
within a few years...

21:38.581 --> 21:39.947
Right.
...both to murder.

21:39.949 --> 21:41.649
Right.
And neither one of
those cases

21:41.651 --> 21:43.584
really had
any justice at all.

21:43.586 --> 21:44.785
That's correct.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.557
I'm seeing a male out here.

21:50.559 --> 21:53.393
He didn't get sucked into
the hole.

21:53.395 --> 21:56.097
He gave it hell, and he won,

21:56.099 --> 21:59.667
and he's here in this reality.

21:59.669 --> 22:01.836
He was a tough...

22:01.838 --> 22:03.871
And I do get that he was
a World War II vet.

22:03.873 --> 22:07.008
Somebody says that he met
with an unfortunate accident.

22:10.413 --> 22:13.947
He has tried to protect
living people.

22:13.949 --> 22:16.417
He said he's tried to warn them
about this hole

22:16.419 --> 22:18.485
and the dragon-gargoyle things,

22:18.487 --> 22:20.220
and he said
it was a waste of his time

22:20.222 --> 22:21.355
and a waste of his energy.

22:21.357 --> 22:24.625
It made him sick, so finally,
he just stopped.

22:24.627 --> 22:27.828
Now he doesn't bother.

22:27.830 --> 22:31.031
He's like, "Trust me.
People got the...message.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.833
They just didn't bother
to listen to it."

22:39.175 --> 22:41.709
For more information
about the show,

22:41.711 --> 22:43.177

to investigate

22:43.179 --> 22:44.979
unexplained activity

and we'll help if we can.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.997
I'm heading out to meet
the local sheriff.

23:03.999 --> 23:05.866
He was digging through
old records and found a case

23:05.868 --> 23:07.734
I'm definitely interested in.

23:07.736 --> 23:11.205
Turns out, a beloved deputy
was gunned down and killed here.

23:11.207 --> 23:13.074
But then the town took matters
into its own hands

23:13.076 --> 23:14.742
and got revenge.

23:24.420 --> 23:25.819
Well, Sheriff,
thanks for meeting me here.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.121
I appreciate that.

23:27.123 --> 23:29.256
What can you tell me about
this murder you found?

23:29.258 --> 23:31.024
In December of 1898,

23:31.026 --> 23:35.463
Town Marshall William McGary
and Deputy Lorenzo Ashby

23:35.465 --> 23:38.165
went to Henry Gooch's residence,
a local farmer,

23:38.167 --> 23:41.302
to serve a warrant
for disturbing the peace.
All right.

23:41.304 --> 23:43.637
So now, how far is this place
from my client's property?

23:43.639 --> 23:46.440
Just
a few hundred yards away.

23:46.442 --> 23:48.108
Okay, so what happens next?

23:48.110 --> 23:51.378
Well, the three men were
standing out in the front lawn.

23:51.380 --> 23:53.180
Jody, the son of Mr. Gooch,

23:53.182 --> 23:57.518
walks up and shoots
both lawmen in the head.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.386
Now are they both
dead on the scene?

23:59.388 --> 24:01.789
No.
Amazingly, McGary ran off.

24:01.791 --> 24:04.158
But he had to be
injured pretty bad.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.261
- How bad was it?
- He had an eye put out.

24:07.263 --> 24:08.662
Okay. Now what about
the other guy?

24:08.664 --> 24:12.566
The partner, Mr. Ashby,
he went into a coma

24:12.568 --> 24:14.268
and lingered around
for a few days,

24:14.270 --> 24:16.136
and he died.
- Okay.

24:16.138 --> 24:21.208
And here is some information
from the local paper.

24:21.210 --> 24:22.475
All right.
So Jody is on the loose.

24:22.477 --> 24:24.844
- Does he get arrested?
- Yes.

24:24.846 --> 24:25.812
Now, Sheriff, you mentioned,
on the phone

24:25.814 --> 24:27.480
that townspeople got
revenge.

24:27.482 --> 24:28.749
What did you mean by that?

24:28.751 --> 24:32.286
In June of 1899,
Henry Gooch,

24:32.288 --> 24:34.755
he was found on the south end
of town in Slaughters

24:34.757 --> 24:37.190
with his head blowed off,
probably with a shotgun.

24:37.192 --> 24:41.228
Here's how the local newspaper
covered the story, Steve.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.563
Okay, so now
this guy is dead.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.598
- Did they arrest anybody for it?
- Yes.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.934
Eventually, they arrested
William McGary.

24:46.936 --> 24:48.635
He was the town marshal.

24:48.637 --> 24:50.103
- He's the guy that...
- Lost his eye.

24:50.105 --> 24:52.906
...lost his eye.
Okay. Did the marshal
go to trial?

24:52.908 --> 24:54.874
- Yes, he did.
- Okay?

24:54.876 --> 24:57.144
And he was found
not guilty.

24:57.146 --> 24:58.846
So what happened
with this kid, Jody Gooch,

24:58.848 --> 25:00.114
who started this whole mess?

25:00.116 --> 25:03.450
Jody was found guilty
in December of 1899

25:03.452 --> 25:06.753
and convicted of manslaughter
and sentenced to 8 years.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.556
Strangely, Steve,
a few years later,

25:08.558 --> 25:12.993
he was pardoned by the governor
and released in 1902.

25:12.995 --> 25:15.296
Okay, so this kid only serves
3 years for this whole thing?

25:15.298 --> 25:16.597
Yes.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.199
Now when he gets out,
does he stay in Slaughters?

25:18.201 --> 25:20.467
No. He leaves Slaughters
and never comes back.

25:20.469 --> 25:21.534
Well, he was smarter
than his father,

25:21.536 --> 25:23.137
that's for sure.
- That's right.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.011
What do these dragon-gargoyle
things want from the living?

25:31.013 --> 25:33.881
They seem to just be taking us

25:33.883 --> 25:36.650
and causing us to die.

25:39.555 --> 25:44.291
They're actually
taking energy of people.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.032
So how much danger
would you say

25:52.034 --> 25:54.367
people living here
would be in from this?

25:54.369 --> 25:57.704
...A lot.

25:57.706 --> 26:03.576
You have people who have been
influenced enough to die,

26:03.578 --> 26:07.180
and you have a child
who is giving its energy

26:07.182 --> 26:08.648
over to this thing,

26:08.650 --> 26:14.154
so I would say that the threat
level here is relatively high.

26:22.031 --> 26:24.798
This was
a very disturbing walk,

26:24.800 --> 26:29.536
but the dragon-gargoyle thing
is clearly the biggest threat.

26:29.538 --> 26:33.674
This thing was coming out
of the darkness.

26:35.611 --> 26:40.147
Very bulbous eyes,
daddy long leg arms.

26:40.149 --> 26:44.051
It was, like,
crawling down the closet.-

26:51.226 --> 26:55.128
Next, I described this creature
possessing a living woman.

26:55.130 --> 26:56.764
This person,

26:56.766 --> 27:01.568
their bones, everything
was turning black.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.237
Their heart has turned
fully black.

27:04.239 --> 27:05.973
They have an evil smile.

27:11.413 --> 27:13.647
Amy, is this what
you saw?

27:15.051 --> 27:16.250
Yes.

27:35.304 --> 27:38.205
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:38.207 --> 27:40.641
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:40.643 --> 27:43.377
and our clients
for the first time.

27:43.379 --> 27:47.114
Amy, this is Holly
and her daughter, Tila.

27:47.116 --> 27:49.849
Let's just say these guys
really need our help.

27:49.851 --> 27:54.154
They share this house
with three guys.

27:54.156 --> 27:56.589
This is Tila's fiancÃ©, John.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.960
This is Holly's friend, Frank,
and this is Holly's son, Ryan,

27:59.962 --> 28:01.694
who is 11 years old.

28:01.696 --> 28:04.198
Everyone is
experiencing activity,

28:04.200 --> 28:06.200
but my heart really goes out
to Tila.

28:06.202 --> 28:07.801
She's going through
a hell of a time

28:07.803 --> 28:11.004
and is convinced the activity
is all her fault.

28:11.006 --> 28:12.739
Now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

28:12.741 --> 28:14.575
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk.

28:17.346 --> 28:21.615
This was a very interesting
walk, to say the least.

28:21.617 --> 28:28.054
I was upstairs in the pretty big
bedroom, and it was really big.

28:28.056 --> 28:30.890
I encountered
a residual impression

28:30.892 --> 28:32.693
of two people arguing.

28:32.695 --> 28:36.496
One was a male, probably
in his mid-to-late 40s,

28:36.498 --> 28:39.099
and he was kind of
standing over this woman,

28:39.101 --> 28:41.167
who was seated in a chair.

28:41.169 --> 28:44.504
He was all screaming at her
because he didn't believe

28:44.506 --> 28:47.708
what she was describing,
experience-wise.

28:47.710 --> 28:49.710
She was crying
and freaking out.

28:49.712 --> 28:51.578
And it was odd to me
because I knew

28:51.580 --> 28:54.714
that the man had
had experiences himself,

28:54.716 --> 28:57.717
so that was
a little upsetting.

28:57.719 --> 28:59.520
You know, Holly,
that sounds a lot like

28:59.522 --> 29:02.523
you and your estranged
husband, Sean.

29:02.525 --> 29:04.725
He would get
extremely angry.

29:04.727 --> 29:07.361
I would try to tell him
what you just described,

29:07.363 --> 29:09.396
and he said,
"Well, call me crazy.

29:09.398 --> 29:12.132
I don't see anything.
Nothing happens here."

29:12.134 --> 29:14.968
- Did he have experiences?
- Yes.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.973
He was the love of my life.

29:19.975 --> 29:21.374
- He was just...
- I'm sorry.

29:21.376 --> 29:24.410
...so sweet, and then
just, he was mean.

29:24.412 --> 29:26.980
Wow, that's bad.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.549
- Yeah.
- Very bad.

29:32.755 --> 29:35.055
So what else?

29:35.057 --> 29:38.959
I went outside, um,
by the little sheds,

29:38.961 --> 29:41.561
and I saw this dead man,

29:41.563 --> 29:44.798
and he had on overalls
and a little cap.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.601
He used to try
and protect the living

29:47.603 --> 29:50.304
from something
dangerous outside,

29:50.306 --> 29:52.573
and then he said that
he stopped.

29:52.575 --> 29:57.578
He just stopped doing it
because nobody was listening.

29:57.580 --> 30:01.114
I got that he was
a World War II vet

30:01.116 --> 30:04.585
and that he's really tough
but overall,

30:04.587 --> 30:07.120
a really good person
at heart,

30:07.122 --> 30:09.389
and then unfortunately,
I got that he did die

30:09.391 --> 30:13.360
in a really terrible
accident.

30:13.362 --> 30:16.062
I didn't come across anybody
in my research

30:16.064 --> 30:17.263
that was a World War II vet.

30:17.265 --> 30:19.600
But does it sound like anybody
you guys know?

30:19.602 --> 30:22.135
My dad was
a World War II veteran.

30:22.137 --> 30:25.038
- Wow.
- Did he die in a bad accident?

30:25.040 --> 30:28.541
- Yes.
- Wow.

30:28.543 --> 30:30.444
My dad was on top
of the tractor,

30:30.446 --> 30:31.711
driving down the road,

30:31.713 --> 30:35.082
and the man was joking around,
swerving behind him,

30:35.084 --> 30:37.217
when he hit the back
of the tractor

30:37.219 --> 30:38.785
and went overtop of my dad.

30:38.787 --> 30:41.288
My god.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.423
So, Holly, it sounds like
your Pop is out there,

30:43.425 --> 30:45.291
looking out for you guys.

30:45.293 --> 30:48.395
It makes me want to cry.

30:48.397 --> 30:49.563
Were you close with him?

30:49.565 --> 30:51.598
Yeah, yeah.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.501
I've had a hard time forgiving
the man that hit him.

30:54.503 --> 30:57.237
This man cheated me.
It hurts.

30:57.239 --> 30:58.671
I know.

31:02.344 --> 31:04.244
So what else happened
on the walk?

31:04.246 --> 31:09.716
So the next entity that I saw
is really the main problem.

31:09.718 --> 31:11.251
It's kind of unusual.

31:11.253 --> 31:15.522
Like I said, this was
a very interesting case.

31:15.524 --> 31:17.824
It can take on
multiple forms.

31:17.826 --> 31:23.397
It looks like a cross between,
like, a little dragon

31:23.399 --> 31:28.001
and a gargoyle with
a little bit of a spider.

31:28.003 --> 31:31.572
Never thought of that,
to use as description for it.

31:31.574 --> 31:34.807
It was crawling across my bed.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.677
It had a really long face.

31:36.679 --> 31:39.279
The only way
I could describe it

31:39.281 --> 31:41.815
was like a dog
with disfigured back legs.

31:44.586 --> 31:46.920
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:49.491 --> 31:53.994
The living could also interpret
this as a shadow figure.

31:53.996 --> 31:58.731
It can cause dizziness,
sickness, and nauseous.

31:58.733 --> 32:00.767
It's also extremely physical.

32:00.769 --> 32:04.270
At one point, it hit me
on the side of my head.

32:04.272 --> 32:05.705
It felt like
I was getting punched.

32:05.707 --> 32:07.673
A lot of what you talked about

32:07.675 --> 32:10.944
is what the family
has been experiencing.

32:10.946 --> 32:12.112
Holly, just tell Amy
how everybody

32:12.114 --> 32:13.980
is getting sick in the house.

32:13.982 --> 32:16.716
I feel a stabbing
in my right side.

32:16.718 --> 32:20.554
Frank never had heart problems
until he moved into the house.

32:20.556 --> 32:22.356
Now you said this thing
gets physical.

32:22.358 --> 32:25.458
He was also telling me that
he was coming down the stairs.

32:25.460 --> 32:28.795
Out of nowhere, he felt, like,
man hands pushed him.

32:28.797 --> 32:31.531
Tila has been
physically attacked, too.

32:31.533 --> 32:37.004
Yeah. It looks like a man
around 6-foot tall.

32:37.006 --> 32:40.073
Whenever he's in my room,
he circles my bed,

32:40.075 --> 32:43.477
and he taunts me, and I could
feel him laying on me,

32:43.479 --> 32:46.046
and I can't breathe,
and I can't move.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.680
I can't sleep.

32:53.088 --> 32:56.556
The thing that was
concerning me the most,

32:56.558 --> 32:59.059
upstairs in
the blue bathroom...

32:59.061 --> 33:00.661
Okay. That's Ryan's room.

33:00.663 --> 33:04.364
...I saw the same entity
slithering down the wall

33:04.366 --> 33:08.234
to scare this kid.

33:08.236 --> 33:11.571
One of the things
that this thing is doing

33:11.573 --> 33:16.275
is draining the energy
from the child,

33:16.277 --> 33:20.714
and I did
have a sketch done.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.520
That's pretty freaky.

33:27.723 --> 33:29.556
My god.

33:32.995 --> 33:36.430
That's in Ryan's room?

33:36.432 --> 33:37.931
I was worried about my brother.

33:37.933 --> 33:41.601
I don't ever want him
going in there again.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.470
You've seen that upstairs?

33:43.472 --> 33:46.606
Yes, but it's...

33:46.608 --> 33:47.941
not just upstairs.

33:51.647 --> 33:53.146
What really freaked me out

33:53.148 --> 33:56.149
is that it can enter
people's dreams.

33:56.151 --> 33:59.553
It gives people horrible,
horrible nightmares.

33:59.555 --> 34:02.456
The people don't even
have to be asleep.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.160
I've had
some really bad dreams.

34:07.162 --> 34:09.094
Had one last week
that Tila died.

34:09.097 --> 34:10.563
I woke up.
My face was soaking wet.

34:10.565 --> 34:13.166
I was balling my eyes out.

34:13.168 --> 34:14.967
This man is always in my dream,

34:14.969 --> 34:20.106
and he's always choking me,
or he's grabbing onto my ribs,

34:20.108 --> 34:23.109
and I can actually feel
this pain when I wake up.

34:23.110 --> 34:25.878
It actually feels like
breaking bones.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.446
Now you had scratch marks.

34:27.447 --> 34:28.715
Yeah.
They were all over my neck,

34:28.717 --> 34:30.250
My mother, when I woke up,
she said,

34:30.252 --> 34:33.085
"What'd you do to yourself?"

34:33.088 --> 34:35.088
I was just trying to stop
from being choked.

34:38.627 --> 34:44.197
On your property,
I saw this vast hole.

34:44.199 --> 34:47.134
This hole has been there
since the beginning of time,

34:47.136 --> 34:52.706
and very negative things
come out of this space

34:52.708 --> 34:55.541
into our reality,

34:55.543 --> 34:59.012
including the thing
I've been talking about.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.582
This hole is basically
another dimension.

35:02.584 --> 35:04.283
I would refer to these beings

35:04.285 --> 35:09.523
as interdimensional
entities or aliens.

35:09.525 --> 35:13.493
My god.

35:13.495 --> 35:17.497
And the dreams that
you guys are having

35:17.499 --> 35:21.067
are, in fact, not really
dreams at all.

35:21.069 --> 35:25.405
It's actually happening
but in a different dimension.

35:25.407 --> 35:30.243
They're taking you
into their reality,

35:30.245 --> 35:32.979
and that's why they're
so extremely vivid

35:32.981 --> 35:36.616
and...frightening,

35:36.618 --> 35:41.054
'cause it's actually something
that is happening.

35:41.056 --> 35:44.123
Okay. And these are aliens.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.258
Yes.

35:46.862 --> 35:51.598
I'm...overwhelmed.

35:51.600 --> 35:55.535
I'm lost for words.
I don't know what to say.

35:55.537 --> 35:57.938
I'm scared it's not
going to end.

36:01.143 --> 36:03.310
Are you okay?

36:03.312 --> 36:07.747
I'm not, but I will be.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.951
To us, they're
extremely dangerous

36:10.953 --> 36:14.453
because they do torture.

36:14.455 --> 36:16.690
I'm seeing them
also kill people.

36:16.692 --> 36:20.126
They will get people
to kill themselves,

36:20.128 --> 36:21.494
and I think,
over the years,

36:21.496 --> 36:26.699
a lot of people have died
around here because of them.

36:26.701 --> 36:28.234
Now...

36:28.236 --> 36:30.370
I don't know if this has
anything to do with aliens,

36:30.372 --> 36:34.941
but there have been a lot of
strange deaths on your property.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.177
For example, the Couch family
that lived in your house,

36:37.179 --> 36:38.845
they moved in around 1910.

36:38.847 --> 36:40.180
Now while they were here,

36:40.182 --> 36:42.448
three family members died
way too young.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.984
- Wow.
- I actually have

36:43.986 --> 36:47.554
a stack of death certificates
right here for them.

36:47.556 --> 36:48.988
Then we've got Stephen Coffman.

36:48.990 --> 36:52.458
Now, in 1899,
Stephen's nephew, William,

36:52.460 --> 36:55.028
got shot by a guy
in a bar in Tennessee.

36:55.030 --> 36:57.396
This kid was 22
at the time of his death.

36:57.398 --> 37:02.735
1905, his son was also 22, got
into a fight with a neighbor,

37:02.737 --> 37:04.771
real close to where we are,

37:04.773 --> 37:06.206
and the neighbor shot
and killed him.

37:09.944 --> 37:12.011
Now, could these things
be responsible

37:12.013 --> 37:13.613
for any of these deaths?

37:13.615 --> 37:15.848
Definitely
a huge possibility.

37:19.354 --> 37:21.955
So on the ground level,

37:21.957 --> 37:24.924
the small bedroom

37:24.926 --> 37:29.062
where, when you open
the door, you hit the bed...

37:29.064 --> 37:30.830
That's Tila's room.

37:30.832 --> 37:33.767
This thing
is targeting you.

37:35.570 --> 37:38.171
And I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

37:43.779 --> 37:45.778
I don't even know if I want
to show this to you.

37:45.780 --> 37:47.414
Um...

37:56.624 --> 37:58.792
I knew it was targeting me.
I knew it.

38:01.063 --> 38:04.197
What exactly is
this thing trying to do to her?

38:04.199 --> 38:09.369
It's taking over your soul.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.174
But it's also affecting
you physically...

38:16.344 --> 38:20.580
...and it's starting to
strip you of your humanity,

38:20.582 --> 38:24.484
your personality, the you.

38:24.486 --> 38:28.888
They're working towards
making you kill yourself.

38:28.890 --> 38:32.191
My god.

38:32.193 --> 38:35.561
I used to be always happy.
I...

38:35.563 --> 38:37.096
When I'm at home,
I'm just depressed,

38:37.098 --> 38:38.364
and I don't want
to do anything.

38:38.366 --> 38:39.833
I'm so tired all the time.

38:39.835 --> 38:41.668
You don't feel
like yourself anymore?

38:44.005 --> 38:45.405
I'm sorry.

38:47.008 --> 38:49.576
This is not something that
Tila brought on herself.

38:49.578 --> 38:51.978
- Right?
- No.

38:51.980 --> 38:54.247
We'll figure this out
one way or another. Okay?

38:54.249 --> 38:57.083
Got to.
It's attacking my kids.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.893
So sorry.

39:06.895 --> 39:09.262
It's not your fault.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.597
- I love you.
- I love you.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.733
You know, I've worked with Amy
for over 6 years now,

39:29.735 --> 39:31.701
and I thought I've heard
it all, but tonight,

39:31.703 --> 39:33.636
I'm as stunned
as you guys are.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.838
Now one thing is obvious.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.706
You probably have a lot of
work ahead of you,

39:36.708 --> 39:39.442
and to find out what it's going
to take to get out of this mess,

39:39.444 --> 39:41.044
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:43.614 --> 39:45.614
Basically, this thing
is something

39:45.616 --> 39:49.419
that has just
been there forever.

39:49.421 --> 39:53.790
So given that, I think the best
thing you can do is to move...

39:55.960 --> 40:00.163
...probably as quickly
as possible.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.766
In the meantime, you should
get religious items,

40:03.768 --> 40:05.235
put them all over the house,

40:05.237 --> 40:07.904
and carry them
on yourselves as well.

40:07.906 --> 40:12.708
Have these reblessed
every week until you move.

40:12.710 --> 40:15.378
Once you vacate
the property,

40:15.380 --> 40:20.149
you need an exorcism done

40:20.151 --> 40:25.354
by the religious person
of your choosing.

40:25.356 --> 40:28.224
The second thing
that you have to do

40:28.226 --> 40:31.528
is to have a series
of 10 Reiki sessions.

40:31.530 --> 40:35.498
This is just to keep you
balanced, grounded.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.633
Okay.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.368
If she doesn't do anything,
what happens?

40:39.370 --> 40:42.005
You'll probably die.

40:45.509 --> 40:49.379
You guys have that
shocked look on your face.

40:49.381 --> 40:53.917
Honestly, I'd rather it be me
than my little brother.

40:53.919 --> 40:57.786
I knew something was wrong,
and I waited so long.

40:57.788 --> 41:02.458
So if she does all this stuff,
this alien will be out of her?

41:02.460 --> 41:04.461
Yes.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.063
Holly, are you going
to sell this house?

41:07.065 --> 41:09.265
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:09.267 --> 41:10.934
It hurts, but yes.

41:10.936 --> 41:14.470
The house is important,
but my kids are more important.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.173
Well, the big question is,
Tila, are you going to do it?

41:17.175 --> 41:18.608
I gotta.

41:18.610 --> 41:22.345
I want a family some day,
and it's worth a life.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.114
You know, I'm scared,
but I'm not going to let it win.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.688
The only way this family
can remain safe

41:31.690 --> 41:34.757
is to move as far away
as possible.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.026
If they do that and contact
a religious leader

41:37.028 --> 41:39.662
to perform an exorcism on Tila,

41:39.664 --> 41:42.365
she and her family
can leave the aliens behind

41:42.367 --> 41:44.834
and begin a peaceful life
someplace new.
