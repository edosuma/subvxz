L'Équipe à Roger

00:37.732 --> 00:40.058
Synchro: mpm

00:58.882 --> 01:01.635
I love martinis.
They heal all wounds.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.230
After about 1000 of them
I'm still amazed.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.311
But your poor liver
has had to work so hard.

01:06.436 --> 01:07.483
I know, I know.

01:07.608 --> 01:10.361
- I'm very proud of her.
- Your liver's female?

01:10.714 --> 01:13.064
All of my internal organs are women.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.835
Listen, I have an early surprise
birthday present for you.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.086
- When is your birthday, by the way?
- In about six months.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.137
Then this is very early.

01:22.559 --> 01:26.252
You know the director Jim Jarmusch...
<i>Down by Law</i>, <i>Broken Flowers</i> ?

01:26.377 --> 01:29.854
- Yeah, I love his movies.
- Well, I saw Jarmusch the other night.

01:30.144 --> 01:32.070
He has very good hair, just...

01:32.368 --> 01:35.386
Anyway, he wants to meet with you,
give you a script to read.

01:35.676 --> 01:39.044
- Why does he want me to read?
- He loves your first novel

01:39.169 --> 01:41.767
and he wants you to do a revision
of one of his screenplays.

01:42.414 --> 01:45.310
You're gonna meet him at a film
society party tomorrow sometime

01:45.435 --> 01:47.314
and I've set
the whole thing up for you.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.527
I don't know.

01:48.652 --> 01:50.462
I really should be
working on my book.

01:50.685 --> 01:53.208
And look, I don't know
how to write screenplays.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.239
You need a computer program
or something.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.712
- It's crazy.
- Don't be a milquetoast.

01:58.553 --> 02:01.829
This is a very big opportunity for you.
It could be a life changer.

02:02.007 --> 02:04.165
Can one screenplay
really change a life?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.332
Sometimes.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.001
Do I want my life to change?

02:07.169 --> 02:08.622
Most people do, Jonathan.

02:08.747 --> 02:11.054
Oh, shit,
there's Antrem and Priscilla.

02:11.833 --> 02:13.337
Don't turn around.

02:13.792 --> 02:16.569
Don't draw attention.
Just sit... Just sit there.

02:17.358 --> 02:18.508
Who are they?

02:19.293 --> 02:21.054
Damn it, I can't stand him.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.329
I can't believe this is happening.
Richard...

02:29.282 --> 02:31.302
used to work for me years ago.

02:32.676 --> 02:34.195
And that's Priscilla,

02:34.457 --> 02:36.030
my best ex-wife.

02:36.681 --> 02:38.613
They recently moved
back to New York.

02:38.738 --> 02:40.768
This is not gonna work.
Let's get out of here.

02:40.893 --> 02:42.721
Why was she your best wife?

02:45.239 --> 02:47.917
Everything with her
was as intimate as kissing.

02:49.175 --> 02:50.803
I never really got over her...

02:51.526 --> 02:54.177
the most orgasmic woman
I've ever been with.

02:55.423 --> 02:57.983
Who was the most orgasmic woman
you've ever been with?

03:00.887 --> 03:02.306
You could use my first name.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.281
But I hope I'm not the most orgasmic
woman you've ever been with.

03:05.406 --> 03:06.806
I'm not that easy.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.836
- Hello, Priscilla.
- Hello, George.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.858
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- I don't.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.777
I look like shit, but thank you.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.282
- How do I look?
- Depraved,

03:17.407 --> 03:18.447
but well-fed.

03:18.884 --> 03:21.116
Jonathan, this is Richard
and Priscilla Antrem.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.189
Richard is the new editor
of <i>Women's Wear Daily</i>.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.914
George, you know I'm editing <i>GQ</i>.
Don't be petty.

03:27.288 --> 03:30.459
- I'm sorry. I get the two confused.
- Of course you do.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.111
You ought to try
doing <i>The Times</i> crossword puzzle.

03:33.236 --> 03:35.236
It's supposed to be good
for senile dementia.

03:35.361 --> 03:36.924
Richard, George, please.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.663
Well, it's very nice
to meet the both of you.

03:39.788 --> 03:41.175
- Same here.
- So...

03:42.007 --> 03:45.099
who was the most orgasmic woman
you've ever been with?

03:45.965 --> 03:48.269
No, I wasn't talking
about me, actually.

03:48.566 --> 03:51.272
Jonathan here mentioned
a woman that he was dating

03:51.440 --> 03:52.773
that was very lively?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.391
- Lively.
- Really?

03:54.927 --> 03:56.616
You've got an awfully good grip.

03:56.741 --> 03:58.737
It's probably kind of handy
in bed, isn't it?

04:01.284 --> 04:02.533
How orgasmic was she?

04:02.839 --> 04:04.285
Thank you about the grip.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.175
Yeah, I... she was...

04:07.993 --> 04:11.091
- I don't want to be rude.
- I don't mind talking about sex.

04:11.216 --> 04:13.210
It's what everybody's
thinking about anyway.

04:13.422 --> 04:15.856
Why don't we sit down
and have a drink and be civilized?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.788
I'd love to, but we actually
were on our way out right now.

04:18.913 --> 04:20.663
So maybe some other time.

04:22.659 --> 04:23.877
So anyway,

04:24.467 --> 04:25.867
hello and goodbye.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.335
Nice to meet you.

04:30.431 --> 04:33.890
That was really weird... the way Antrem
wouldn't let go of my hand.

04:34.015 --> 04:36.260
He's a strange
and tormented creature.

04:36.385 --> 04:37.695
It really disturbs me

04:37.820 --> 04:40.720
that Priscilla loved me once
and now loves him.

04:41.439 --> 04:43.689
I'd hate to think what that means.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.473
They're very nice ladies.
Well, one of them is.

04:49.598 --> 04:51.248
I'd be doing them a huge favor.

04:51.611 --> 04:54.543
I don't feel good about this.
I don't want you to be a sperm donor.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.479
But it's flattering.
They're fans of my work.

04:57.604 --> 04:59.423
I've never had lesbian fans before.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.172
They should go to a sperm bank.

05:01.297 --> 05:02.985
You can't just give your sperm

05:03.110 --> 05:05.012
to two girls you met in a cafe.

05:05.215 --> 05:06.430
I met you in a cafe.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.046
I just feel like you
shouldn't be doing this.

05:12.171 --> 05:13.575
The world is overpopulated.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.335
You know there's an island of plastic
the size of Texas in the pacific.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.406
I know, Leah.
You told me this 1000 times.

05:20.566 --> 05:24.281
Please don't dismiss what I'm saying.
Overpopulation is important to me.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.366
Look, I don't think
that me giving these lesbians

05:27.491 --> 05:29.175
one illegitimate child

05:29.300 --> 05:31.080
is gonna add that much plastic.

05:31.528 --> 05:33.540
You have two children.
Why can't I have one?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.069
But you haven't
thought this through.

05:37.287 --> 05:38.545
You don't listen to me.

05:39.939 --> 05:42.155
I do listen.
I've heard everything you've said.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
Really?

05:43.433 --> 05:45.049
You don't listen listen.

05:45.174 --> 05:46.762
I want you to go for therapy.

05:47.479 --> 05:48.480
Oh, God.

05:55.197 --> 05:56.855
I'll trade you therapy for sex.

05:57.881 --> 05:59.502
It's been almost three weeks.

06:01.749 --> 06:04.508
I think it's sweet you
know how long it's been.

06:17.029 --> 06:18.367
Let's get a drink.

06:18.784 --> 06:21.811
- Keep an eye out for Jarmusch.
- There's a lot of good-looking women...

06:21.936 --> 06:23.507
much better than at book parties.

06:27.770 --> 06:28.770
Goodbye.

06:29.892 --> 06:31.492
- White wine?
- Yeah.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.270
Why is it wherever I go
I look for Suzanne?

06:37.755 --> 06:39.655
Because your heart's broken.

06:40.252 --> 06:43.694
You're looking for the piece
that is her to put it back together.

06:43.969 --> 06:45.804
I'll probably do the same
with Priscilla

06:45.929 --> 06:48.449
now that she's back in town,
God help me.

06:48.617 --> 06:49.986
If it works out with Jarmusch

06:50.111 --> 06:52.643
I'll be so distracted
that I'll forget about Suzanne.

06:53.087 --> 06:56.115
Movies equal money, women,
glamour...

06:56.826 --> 06:59.501
- more women.
- I like that. That's positive thinking.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.813
- But is any of it meaningful?
- No,

07:02.255 --> 07:03.255
but it's fun.

07:05.210 --> 07:07.645
There's Jarmusch.
All right, let's go. All right?

07:07.770 --> 07:09.170
Look at that hair.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.760
This is...

07:13.948 --> 07:16.192
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
We just met.

07:16.317 --> 07:17.317
Miriam.

07:17.976 --> 07:19.954
Nice to meet you.
George Christopher.

07:20.079 --> 07:21.857
And this is Jonathan ames.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.526
- The man I want to meet.
- It's very nice to meet you.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.987
Could you excuse us?
We have some business to talk over.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.238
- Sure.
- Thanks.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.158
Are those hummingbirds?

07:32.380 --> 07:34.930
They're dipping
their beaks into flowers.

07:36.866 --> 07:37.966
I love them.

07:39.095 --> 07:41.381
- What was your name again?
- Miriam.

07:44.086 --> 07:45.772
So I really loved your novel...

07:45.897 --> 07:48.021
dark, funny, perverted, beautiful.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.721
You must really suffer from
the terrifying clarity of your vision.

07:53.133 --> 07:54.833
Thank you.
I do suffer.

07:55.255 --> 07:56.255
Thank you.

07:56.798 --> 07:58.313
Take a look at this screenplay.

07:58.438 --> 07:59.935
I kind of dashed it off.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.064
It's about the New York poet
Frank O'Hara.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.275
He had a beautiful nose
like a boxer.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.944
Yeah, I know.
I love his nose.

08:07.610 --> 08:10.239
He got run over by a dune buggy
on Fire Island.

08:11.044 --> 08:13.662
Anyway, I'd like you to think
about doing a rewrite on this.

08:13.787 --> 08:16.908
- George has my number.
- Thank you for this opportunity.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.718
I love your work
and I can't wait to read this.

08:19.843 --> 08:20.724
Thanks.

08:21.430 --> 08:24.460
Did you have this script made for me?
My name's on the cover.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.993
Now when you give someone
a script to read

08:27.118 --> 08:31.122
it's kind of standard practice
to laser print their name on every page.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.469
I see.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.943
This is not a big deal,
but my name is misspelled.

08:35.068 --> 08:38.280
There's no "O" at the end.
It's "Jonathan", not "Jonathon".

08:38.611 --> 08:40.102
Yeah, man, I don't know.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.619
It's not really important.

08:41.744 --> 08:43.397
But call me tomorrow

08:44.052 --> 08:45.986
and it's really great to meet you.

08:46.111 --> 08:47.511
Great to meet you.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.632
Thank you, Jim Jarmusch.

08:51.311 --> 08:52.698
Do you know Jim Jarmusch?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.462
He's my favorite director
of all time.

08:56.587 --> 08:58.466
His films are like poems
that come to life.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.463
It's really interesting.

09:00.588 --> 09:03.876
The film that we might work on together
is actually sort of about that.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.878
You're gonna work with Jim Jarmusch?

09:13.802 --> 09:15.814
I don't want to go
to a bar on Smith street.

09:15.939 --> 09:17.810
Let's just go back to my place.

09:17.935 --> 09:20.369
I live with my dad,
but he'll be out tonight.

09:20.494 --> 09:23.645
- We can have a drink there.
- What year are you again at N.Y.U?

09:23.988 --> 09:25.838
- Senior.
- Senior? Okay.

09:25.963 --> 09:27.900
Wait, so you're 22, right?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.568
I'm going to be soon.
I'm 21.

09:29.954 --> 09:31.987
You don't think i'm too old,
do you? I'm 30.

09:32.289 --> 09:35.239
30 is cool.
I've been with guys older than you.

09:35.847 --> 09:37.747
But are you a man or a boy?

09:38.465 --> 09:40.746
Well, what's the difference?

09:41.023 --> 09:42.187
With a man...

09:42.473 --> 09:44.833
you feel like you're being taken
and you like it.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.433
And with a boy you feel like
they're stealing something from you

09:48.558 --> 09:49.796
and you don't like it.

09:55.841 --> 09:57.429
This is it.
Thank you.

10:00.823 --> 10:02.773
Shit, my dad is home already.

10:02.898 --> 10:05.698
We can go to seventh avenue
and grab a drink.

10:05.823 --> 10:08.148
We're going in his office.
It's fun in there.

10:08.967 --> 10:10.867
It's a beautiful brownstone.

10:16.057 --> 10:18.464
- Your dad's a therapist?
- Yeah, he's a pain in the ass.

10:18.589 --> 10:20.869
He thinks
he's the Carl Jung of Brooklyn.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.146
I like Carl Jung.

10:22.271 --> 10:24.267
Not when he's your dad
and he acts like your diary

10:24.392 --> 10:26.541
is part of the collective
unconscious.

10:37.185 --> 10:38.185
Wait.

10:38.559 --> 10:40.991
Sorry, I keep thinking
about people sitting on this couch

10:41.116 --> 10:42.808
talking about being sexually abused.

10:44.053 --> 10:45.435
That's what makes it fun.

10:50.504 --> 10:51.913
You're a good kisser.

10:52.038 --> 10:53.527
Am I a manly kisser?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.739
Do you want to go
to my prom with me?

10:58.151 --> 10:59.501
N.Y.U. has proms?

11:00.335 --> 11:01.885
Shit.
I'm drunk.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.872
I should be honest with you.
I don't go to N.Y.U.

11:06.075 --> 11:08.667
- Where do you go? Hunter?
- St. Anne's.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.711
The high school?
How old are you?

11:11.187 --> 11:13.037
- Old enough.
- Wait wait.

11:13.162 --> 11:15.549
You want me to go to your senior prom,
right? You're 18?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.426
- No, junior prom.
- You're 17?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.270
- 16.
- 16 years old?

11:19.395 --> 11:21.305
But I'll be 17 in two weeks.

11:21.745 --> 11:24.046
You're 16?
Oh my God, oh my God.

11:24.309 --> 11:27.519
Don't freak out. I haven't been a virgin
for almost a year.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.647
I probably know more
about sex than you do.

11:31.388 --> 11:33.509
I know plenty about sex, okay?

11:34.200 --> 11:37.073
That doesn't matter.
You said you weresn't 21.

11:37.198 --> 11:39.792
There's a big difference
between 21 and 16.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.269
Look, I'm sorry.

11:41.394 --> 11:43.358
You're beautiful,
but I have to leave.

11:43.483 --> 11:46.580
I feel really guilty.
I wish I had met you in high school.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.563
I wouldn't have liked you then.

11:49.074 --> 11:50.174
That's true.

11:51.438 --> 11:53.272
If you really have to go

11:53.901 --> 11:56.553
I want to give you something
to remember me by.

11:57.470 --> 12:00.282
And you can tell Jim
he can put me in his movie.

12:00.762 --> 12:01.928
Don't do that.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.286
- Dad!
- What the hell is going on here?

12:19.405 --> 12:21.239
That's right.
Run, you little sick.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.849
Oh, shit, the script.

13:01.387 --> 13:03.990
- You're gonna go to your mother's.
- You don't understand me.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.196
I don't want to.
You're gonna go to your mother's.

13:06.321 --> 13:09.066
You can't deal with being
attracted to your own daughter.

13:09.191 --> 13:12.502
Do not try to pull transference on me.
I invented transference.

13:17.422 --> 13:20.092
I called the girl, but she's
already in Connecticut with her mom

13:20.217 --> 13:21.758
so she can't get the screenplay.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.419
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- You gotta break into that place.

13:25.544 --> 13:27.347
I can't break into a therapy office.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.100
Why? What difference does it make?
You gotta get in there.

13:30.268 --> 13:31.868
No, it's not possible.

13:32.369 --> 13:34.813
George is gonna kill me
and so is Jim Jarmusch.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.934
Well, they can't both kill you.

13:37.059 --> 13:39.109
Just call the dad and ask for it.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.968
He will shoot me.
She's only 16 years old...

13:42.263 --> 13:44.239
Well, nearly 17. Nearly 17.

13:45.266 --> 13:47.200
- You didn't sodomize her, did you?
- No.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.608
That's too bad.

13:49.377 --> 13:52.396
You gotta be careful.
A lot of things fall under sodomy.

13:52.521 --> 13:53.915
I wonder if kissing is sodomy.

13:54.245 --> 13:55.495
Don't say that.

13:59.246 --> 14:00.983
I need to get this screenplay.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.341
I'm supposed to call Jarmusch
and tell him what I think.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.886
Ignore it. Don't answer your phone.
That's what I would do.

14:06.101 --> 14:09.001
But I don't want it to blow over.
I want this.

14:09.159 --> 14:10.909
I can't work on my novel.

14:11.407 --> 14:12.707
I need this job.

14:16.210 --> 14:19.191
What about you go to the therapist
as a patient?

14:20.328 --> 14:21.485
I don't need help.

14:21.653 --> 14:24.051
No, it's not about that.
It's about getting the script.

14:24.176 --> 14:25.946
You could act like
you've lost control

14:26.071 --> 14:28.950
and then just stick your hand behind
the couch, grab the thing and flee.

14:29.127 --> 14:32.122
- Why don't you do that?
- I'm too close to the whole situation.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.847
I'll blow it.
Please.

14:34.457 --> 14:37.255
I'll pay for the therapy,
give you 50 bucks

14:37.467 --> 14:39.707
and buy you dinner
at Sammy's Romanian.

14:39.839 --> 14:40.921
I do like Sammy's.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.658
Leah has been trying
to get me to go to therapy

14:48.783 --> 14:51.652
and maybe this way she'll get
off my back and onto hers.

14:51.777 --> 14:53.642
What?
What did I say?

14:56.083 --> 14:58.396
Jonathan found
a therapist that he likes

14:59.141 --> 15:01.191
and I'm gonna go

15:01.359 --> 15:03.885
just like you said,
so then we'll, you know...

15:04.010 --> 15:06.255
Great, 'cause once you go
for a few months

15:06.380 --> 15:08.949
and learn the language we can
go for couples' counseling.

15:13.637 --> 15:15.490
So what should I
talk about in there?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.362
The guy already thinks I'm nuts...

15:17.487 --> 15:19.547
asking for a suicidal
emergency meeting.

15:19.672 --> 15:21.544
No, that's fine.
Just throw a fit,

15:21.669 --> 15:24.297
pull back the couch,
grab the script and run out of there.

15:24.725 --> 15:28.221
That is the worst plan ever.
I gotta warm up before I flip out.

15:28.346 --> 15:31.771
I gotta lull the guy in.
If I go nuts immediately

15:32.393 --> 15:34.891
he might try to throw
a straitjacket on me or something.

15:35.438 --> 15:36.351
That's true.

15:38.017 --> 15:40.802
Maybe I'll come up
with some fake issues like I overeat...

15:44.007 --> 15:47.118
- You sort of do, don't you?
- Don't be rude.

15:47.243 --> 15:49.751
Or maybe talk about how Leah
never wants to have sex with me.

15:49.876 --> 15:51.658
That sounds like another real issue.

15:52.784 --> 15:56.550
- Do you want my help or not?
- Sorry. That's the place right there.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.940
I'll see you in an hour

15:59.078 --> 16:00.371
or 50 minutes.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.061
Thank you for saving my life.

16:09.186 --> 16:10.885
I'll wait for you here by this tree.

16:11.412 --> 16:13.362
Okay, thank you, Boo Radley.

16:46.794 --> 16:48.228
Where's the screenplay?

16:48.353 --> 16:51.023
I didn't get it.
I forgot, I'm sorry.

16:51.774 --> 16:54.054
- The session was too much.
- What happened in there?

16:54.222 --> 16:56.603
He gutted me like a fish.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.520
He said I was so cut off
from my feelings

16:59.645 --> 17:01.845
that everyone in my life would die

17:01.970 --> 17:04.021
without knowing that
I ever really loved them.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.148
God, that's terrible.
I'm sorry.

17:06.396 --> 17:07.525
I want to go home.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.442
I want a beer.
I want an ice-cream sandwich.

17:10.567 --> 17:12.972
I want to take a nap.
And then I'm going to get...

17:15.371 --> 17:17.308
I want to read a comic book.

17:17.433 --> 17:20.038
I want to watch <i>Little house
on the prairie</i> and I want a vodka.

17:21.271 --> 17:23.791
Well, this is the biggest
screw-up ever.

17:24.484 --> 17:26.791
How old was the girl?
14?

17:26.916 --> 17:28.631
No no, 16, nearly 17.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.348
That's not so bad.
Polanski was much worse.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.128
- Polanski?
- You have got to getthis.

17:35.526 --> 17:37.013
Jarmusch is gonna blame me.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.849
- I'm sorry, George.
- I think you did this on purpose.

17:40.020 --> 17:41.470
You self-sabotaged.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.687
George, are you coming back to bed?

17:44.077 --> 17:45.077
I'm lonely.

17:45.324 --> 17:47.107
In a minute.
Put on the TV.

17:47.822 --> 17:51.403
- Who's in there?
- Miriam from the other night.

17:52.989 --> 17:55.414
She's not Priscilla,
but she's wonderful.

17:56.220 --> 17:58.659
You know, I'm very oral nowadays.

17:58.784 --> 18:02.330
I feel like
I'm half man, half infant.

18:04.044 --> 18:06.594
George, please.
I watch TV all the time.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.384
I'll be right in.

18:12.093 --> 18:14.592
You look absolutely beautiful.

18:15.340 --> 18:16.340
So do you.

18:23.201 --> 18:25.261
She makes me feel like I'm 50 again.

18:25.386 --> 18:26.936
Now I'm feeling oral.

18:27.194 --> 18:31.067
All right, you gotta work this out.
I don't want Jarmusch pissed off at me.

18:31.251 --> 18:33.618
- How am I gonna get the script back?
- I don't know.

18:33.876 --> 18:37.731
I'm gonna have to give you tough love.
You did this. You clean it up.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.042
George, please.

18:54.802 --> 18:57.135
I'm proud of you
for going to therapy.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.156
I'm sorry, I can't tonight.

19:09.809 --> 19:11.690
That guy eviscerated me.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.944
My penis is totally recessed.

19:15.244 --> 19:16.244
What?

19:16.369 --> 19:18.990
When I was a little kid I used
to like to push my penis in

19:19.115 --> 19:21.185
to make it look like it disappeared.

19:22.937 --> 19:24.926
Today that happened all by itself.

19:45.616 --> 19:47.817
So I'm not the kind
that pussyfoots around.

19:47.942 --> 19:49.689
I like to dig in fast
and I give feedback.

19:49.814 --> 19:52.026
Stop fidgeting.
What are you doing with your arm?

19:52.151 --> 19:54.859
- Nothing. I'm nervous.
- Put your hands in your lap. Focus.

19:55.241 --> 19:58.175
Sit up. Good posture sends
positive messages to the brain.

19:58.300 --> 20:01.282
We're here to work.
So what are you issues? Give them to me.

20:03.214 --> 20:05.161
I am sad about this breakup
I went through.

20:05.350 --> 20:06.329
She left you?

20:06.497 --> 20:09.014
And you feel rejected and unlovable
and you can't understand

20:09.139 --> 20:10.993
why she no longer loves you?

20:11.118 --> 20:14.045
You do know that she is not the only
source of love for you in the world?

20:14.361 --> 20:17.457
- But I want her love.
- We don't get everything we want.

20:17.582 --> 20:18.977
We don't get to ever love.

20:19.102 --> 20:21.678
That's it. End of story.
Next issues.

20:28.349 --> 20:29.449
I'm a writer

20:29.687 --> 20:32.129
and I've been struggling
to write my second novel.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.108
I'm thinking about moving over
to writing screenplays

20:35.366 --> 20:36.776
- have you?
- Not yet.

20:37.117 --> 20:38.922
We'll start with
the second novel then.

20:39.047 --> 20:42.699
Was your father competitive with you,
didn't like your mum showing attention?

20:43.478 --> 20:45.474
A little.
He never complimented me.

20:45.599 --> 20:47.658
And whenever I hugged
my mother he said

20:47.783 --> 20:50.716
that it disturbed him to see
me acting like a mama's boy.

20:50.841 --> 20:53.078
Well, simple then...
you can't write a second book

20:53.203 --> 20:55.895
because you're afraid to hurt yourdad.
Classic oedipal setup.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.631
But how is writing my novel
being like Oedipus?

20:58.783 --> 21:00.916
Because in doing so you
will surpass your father.

21:01.041 --> 21:03.881
Oedipus killed his father
and slept with his mother.

21:04.006 --> 21:06.069
Success for you is like murder.

21:06.194 --> 21:07.682
But you are not a murderer.

21:08.923 --> 21:11.394
Well, thank you.
So what should I do?

21:11.562 --> 21:13.369
Know that you're allowed
to write a 2d book

21:13.494 --> 21:15.899
and your father won't be hurt.
And if he is, fuck him.

21:17.350 --> 21:19.669
- But I love my dad.
- Then don't write a second novel

21:19.794 --> 21:21.404
and don't come whining to me.

21:21.837 --> 21:22.887
Next issue.

21:23.913 --> 21:27.274
Put the hands in the lap.

21:27.915 --> 21:28.906
Focus.

21:30.403 --> 21:31.403
Next issue.

21:32.131 --> 21:33.166
All right.

21:36.830 --> 21:39.015
I put up this thing on Craigslist

21:39.140 --> 21:41.787
advertising myself
as an unlicensed private detective.

21:41.912 --> 21:43.885
- I've had a few cases.
- So what's the problem?

21:44.693 --> 21:47.013
Is it wrong?
I do say I'm unlicensed.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.997
Sounds to me like a double life.

21:49.122 --> 21:51.668
I think that I am.
I'm like a russian doll.

21:51.793 --> 21:54.729
There's all these
versions of me in me.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.737
There's only one you
and he's running away from his life.

21:57.862 --> 22:00.730
Oedipus, you know,
was the first detective in literature.

22:00.855 --> 22:03.705
He uncovered mysteries
to find out who he was.

22:04.138 --> 22:06.532
I'm sorry, so let me
just get this straight...

22:06.657 --> 22:08.404
i'm not gonna get
my girlfriend back;

22:08.529 --> 22:11.245
i'm afraid about my second novel,
and I'm a 21st-century oedipus?

22:13.521 --> 22:16.322
But there is one other thing.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.088
I know why you're really here.

22:21.904 --> 22:24.217
I'm not an idiot, you know.
Your name is on every page.

22:24.385 --> 22:26.438
I would have used a false name

22:26.563 --> 22:30.223
but my insurance are stickler...
So you know about me and Claudia?

22:30.872 --> 22:33.363
And you're not mad?
I thought she was 21.

22:33.488 --> 22:35.300
We did only kiss.
She's very mature.

22:35.425 --> 22:36.796
I promise I only kissed her.

22:36.921 --> 22:40.335
I'm not mad at you. My daughter is
precocious and wild like my ex-wife.

22:40.460 --> 22:42.475
She likes to sleep
with boys in my office...

22:42.600 --> 22:44.320
Electra complex.
So I don't blame you.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.364
Thank you, but we did only kiss.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.151
Also I don't mix my personal life
and my work life.

22:49.276 --> 22:51.411
This office
is my professional domain,

22:51.709 --> 22:53.769
a sanctuary
where clients can be safe.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.083
And you're a client, even though
you're here under false pretenses.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.776
- I'm sorry.
- But outside these doors

23:00.072 --> 23:02.070
I would cease to be a therapist.

23:02.195 --> 23:04.315
- I would become a father.
- I understand.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.125
Considering the circumstances,

23:07.017 --> 23:08.511
I want to end the session now.

23:11.430 --> 23:12.430
Thank you.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.852
So why were you so hell-bent
on getting this script back?

23:16.509 --> 23:18.544
Because I have a chance
to work with Jarmusch.

23:18.669 --> 23:20.672
And if I do, my whole life
could change.

23:21.092 --> 23:24.152
Sounds like an illusion to me.
Lives don't change.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.632
We simply become more comfortable
with our core misery,

23:26.757 --> 23:28.367
which is a form of happiness.

23:28.645 --> 23:29.645
Right.

23:36.621 --> 23:38.958
Thank you for being
so understanding about everything.

23:49.182 --> 23:50.303
One last thing.

23:50.471 --> 23:54.475
If you go near my daughter again
I'll break your fucking neck!

24:04.906 --> 24:06.406
Same time next week?

24:09.041 --> 24:11.605
Hey, Jonathan.
I'm glad you found me.

24:13.217 --> 24:15.078
This is where I do my best thinking.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.153
Yes, the place is great.

24:18.197 --> 24:20.819
Jim... Mr. Jarmusch,
your assistant said you were here.

24:21.043 --> 24:23.544
Sorry to intrude,
but I read the script...

24:23.751 --> 24:26.589
which I love... and I've got
a lot of good ideas about what to do.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.680
Oh, man, that's too bad, you know.

24:28.805 --> 24:32.053
When I didn't hear from you yesterday
I called Charlie Kaufman.

24:32.431 --> 24:33.971
He's been sitting on this script

24:34.139 --> 24:37.163
