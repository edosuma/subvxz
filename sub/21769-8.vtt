WEBVTT

00:25.459 --> 00:27.895
WELL, THAT WAS A ROUGH
DAY AT THE OFFICE.

00:29.930 --> 00:33.600
I'M GONNA SAY SPENDING
SIX HOURS HANDING OUT
COUPONS

00:33.667 --> 00:34.968
IN FRONT
OF CHUCK'S CHICKEN SHACK

00:35.035 --> 00:37.871
IS OFFICIALLY
THE WORST JOB
WE'VE EVER HAD.

00:39.306 --> 00:42.709
YEAH, WE LOOK LIKE
BIG BIRD'S ILLEGITIMATE KIDS.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.880
<i>( CELL PHONE BEEPS )</i>

00:48.115 --> 00:50.484
OH MY GOD!

00:50.551 --> 00:53.720
LOOK WHAT KELLY WEBSTER
WROTE ON MY FACEBOOK WALL.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.028
"HI, GEORGIA, I'M SURE
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT
IN N.Y.C.

01:01.094 --> 01:03.297
I MISS YOU!"

01:03.363 --> 01:06.033
OH MY GOD!
CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

01:06.099 --> 01:08.769
THAT'S A NICE MESSAGE.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.038
LET ME PUT THIS
THROUGH THE POPULAR GIRL
TRANSLATOR FOR YOU.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.675
"HEY, GEORGIA,
YOU'RE A LOSER.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.477
YOU WILL NEVER AMOUNT
TO ANYTHING IN NEW YORK.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.046
AND I AM SO MUCH
BETTER THAN YOU."

01:19.112 --> 01:21.882
HOW DID YOU GET
ALL THAT FROM--

01:21.949 --> 01:24.051
BECAUSE SHE POSTED IT
KNOWING THAT I WOULD
GO TO-- THANK YOU.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.254
KNOWING THAT I WOULD GO
TO HER FACEBOOK PAGE.

01:27.321 --> 01:29.723
SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO THROW SOMETHING UP
IN MY FACE.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.991
IT'S SO PATHETIC.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.461
"JUST SHARED A CAB
WITH KATY PERRY,

01:34.528 --> 01:37.030
SUPERCUTE NEW YORK MOMENT!"

01:37.097 --> 01:41.435
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT
YOU HAVE TO DO TO STAY ON
TOP AS A POPULAR GIRL.

01:41.502 --> 01:45.439
BEING POPULAR
SOUNDS LIKE HARD WORK.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.509
NOW YOU KNOW WHY YOU
HAD TO WRITE ALL MY
PAPERS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.112
I WAS BUSY.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.116
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:13.367
LOWER THE BRIDGE
AND RAISE YOUR SWORDS, BOYS.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.135
LET'S GET OUT
AND DECAPITATE SOME OGRES.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.173
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?

02:19.239 --> 02:21.041
I'M PLAYING
"DWARF QUEST 4."

02:21.108 --> 02:24.044
SEE, I'M A SPELL-CASTING
DWARF.

02:24.111 --> 02:27.047
WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY!

02:27.114 --> 02:29.550
DON'T I KNOW IT.

02:29.616 --> 02:32.219
JO IS GONNA DIE ALONE
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.056
AT LEAST PUT SOME
LIPSTICK ON, SWEETIE.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.926
NO NO NO.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.060
KELLY WEBSTER
JUST EMAILED ME.

02:40.127 --> 02:44.798
SHE'S COMING TO NEW YORK
AND SHE WANTS TO HANG.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.767
WHO IS KELLY WEBSTER?

02:46.834 --> 02:50.537
SHE'S GEORGIA'S
FRENEMY FROM BACK HOME.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.006
SHE PRETENDS TO BE
MY BESTIE, AUNT HONEY,

02:53.073 --> 02:56.210
BUT SHE LIVES
TO HUMILIATE ME.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.845
"HI, GEORGIA,

02:57.911 --> 03:00.747
I'M SURE YOU'RE HAVING
A GREAT TIME IN N.Y.C.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.816
I MISS YOU."

03:02.883 --> 03:04.017
OH, THAT SNAKE
IN THE GRASS.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.687
WHAT?!

03:06.753 --> 03:08.822
WHAT DO YOU NEED, BABY?

03:08.889 --> 03:11.058
I REALLY NEED
TO IMPRESS KELLY WEBSTER.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.329
OKAY, SO I WAS WONDERING,
STAY CLEAR FOR TOMORROW NIGHT

03:15.395 --> 03:17.297
SO SHE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT YOU TOOK US IN.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.234
IT'S NOT ON MY
HIGHLIGHT REEL EITHER.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.173
WELL, STAYING OUT OF YOUR
NOT BE A PROBLEM.ING WILL

03:26.240 --> 03:29.042
I'M GOING TO A VERY
HIGH-END KEY PARTY.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.678
PICK YOUR JAWS UP.

03:31.745 --> 03:35.682
WE TRADE KEYS TO EACH
OTHER'S LUXURY CARS.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.317
( SIGHS )
I JUST HOPE I DON'T GET

03:37.384 --> 03:39.820
MARTHA STEWART'S
BENTLEY AGAIN--

03:39.887 --> 03:43.323
POP-TART WRAPPERS
EVERYWHERE.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.863
SO, JO,
I KINDA TOLD KELLY

03:49.930 --> 03:51.865
THAT I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME THEATER,

03:51.932 --> 03:55.068
AND I WAS WONDERING
MY PICTURE INTO SOME PLAYBILLS.

03:55.135 --> 03:58.238
OH, AND THE ROYAL WEDDING
PHOTO TOO.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.340
I BOUGHT A HAT.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.042
OKAY, I'LL DO THAT LATER.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.711
I'VE GOTTA GET
TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW

04:04.778 --> 04:07.881
BECAUSE WE'RE NOMINATING
OUR PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
LIAISON.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.450
I'M SORRY.
I TUNED OUT AFTER "PHYSICS."
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

04:12.085 --> 04:15.389
EVERYONE THINKS
I'M A LOCK TO BE
STUDENT LIAISON

04:15.455 --> 04:19.159
BECAUSE I CAN DO ONE
SPECIAL THING THAT NONE
OF THOSE BOYS CAN DO.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.528
GETTING YOUR PERIOD
IS NOT A SUPERPOWER.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.033
IT'S JUST WHAT
YOUR MOM TOLD YOU

04:26.099 --> 04:29.469
SO YOU COULD STOP
CALLING 911 EVERY MONTH.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.039
- YEAH, NO, NOT THAT.
- OKAY.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.542
I HAVE SOCIAL SKILLS.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.044
( LAUGHS )
YEAH, THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

04:37.110 --> 04:39.346
WITH A PERSON WEARING
A SHIRT THAT SAYS,

04:39.413 --> 04:41.415
"WHAT WOULD CHEWBACCA DO"

04:43.417 --> 04:47.387
IF MORE PEOPLE ASKED THAT
QUESTION, THE WORLD WOULD
BE A BETTER PLACE.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.798
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S UP?

04:57.865 --> 05:01.301
I WAS GOOGLING SETH.
DON'T ASK WHY.

05:01.368 --> 05:04.805
AND I FOUND OUT HE WAS
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:04.872 --> 05:08.809
COULD YOU DO PUSHUPS?
BOY PUSHUPS?

05:08.876 --> 05:12.012
IT WAS A MATH
AND SCIENCE MAGNET SCHOOL,

05:12.079 --> 05:14.047
AND I WAS ONLY THE BACKUP
PUNTER ON THE PRACTICE SQUAD,

05:14.114 --> 05:18.852
ALTHOUGH WE DID GET
TO RIDE ON THE BUS WITH
THE CHEERLEADING ALTERNATES.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.922
- ( GASPING )
- NO WAY!

05:21.989 --> 05:25.259
OW, MY WRIST.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.564
I HEREBY NOMINATE SETH
FOR PHYSICS DEPARTMENT LIAISON

05:30.631 --> 05:32.866
BECAUSE SOCIALLY,
HE'S THE TOP OF OUR PYRAMID.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.035
BUT WAIT, WHAT ABOUT ME?
I THOUGHT I WAS THE TOP
OF OUR PYRAMID.

05:35.102 --> 05:39.473
- I'LL NOMINATE YOU, JO.
- REALLY? THANKS, SETH.

05:39.540 --> 05:43.010
OH MY GOD! HE JUST DID
THAT COOL GUY THING OF BEING
NICE TO AN UNCOOL PERSON

05:43.076 --> 05:46.146
BECAUSE HE'S SO SECURE
IN HIS OWN COOLNESS.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.248
I'VE NEVER NOTICED THIS,
BUT SETH IS CLEARLY

05:48.315 --> 05:50.017
THE MOST ATTRACTIVE
AMONG US.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.119
DOY!

05:54.721 --> 05:56.089
WHAT? HE HAS THE MOST
SYMMETRICAL FEATURES.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.962
HERE YOU GO, GEORGIA.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.065
ACCORDING TO THIS POSTER,
YOU'VE NOW DONE "SHAKESPEARE
IN THE PARK."

06:06.700 --> 06:08.735
THANK YOU, JO.
I'M GONNA PUT
THIS RIGHT HERE

06:08.802 --> 06:10.037
SO KELLY SEES IT.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.906
DON'T YOU WANNA
HANG IT UP SOMEWHERE?

06:12.973 --> 06:16.510
JO, IF I HANG IT UP,
THEN SHE KNOWS THAT
I WANT HER TO SEE IT.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.046
BUT YOU DO WANT HER
TO SEE IT.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.949
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
INCREDIBLE.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.652
OKAY, WHAT ELSE
YOU GOT FOR ME?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.321
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE
IN A COUPLE OF COOL
INDIE MOVIES.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.156
I DID THE POSTER
AND SOME PLAYBILLS,

06:29.223 --> 06:31.024
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO DO ANYTHING ELSE,

06:31.091 --> 06:34.394
BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO WRITE
A SPEECH FOR AN ELECTION I
SHOULD HAVE ALREADY WON.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.864
<i>( KNOCK ON DOOR )</i>

06:36.930 --> 06:38.031
OKAY, WELL, IF IT MAKES
YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

06:38.098 --> 06:41.168
I TOLD KELLY
YOU INVENTED TWITTER.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.137
JUST WORK IT IN
SOMEWHERE, OKAY?

06:49.543 --> 06:51.478
( BOTH SHRIEK )

06:51.545 --> 06:54.181
BOTH:
HUGS! MWAH! MWAH!

06:55.115 --> 06:59.353
HI, JO. I HEARD YOU
INVENTED TWITTER.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.121
THAT'S NEAT.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.460
I SURE DID.
LITTLE KNOWN FACT,

07:06.527 --> 07:10.030
THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION
IS ACTUALLY "TWITER."

07:12.299 --> 07:14.301
TWITE YOUR FRIENDS.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.939
WELL, THIS IS QUITE
THE PLACE

07:19.006 --> 07:21.008
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY BEEN
HERE A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.311
- OH, IT'S NOT MINE.
- OH?

07:24.378 --> 07:27.314
SUGAR DADDY?

07:27.381 --> 07:30.817
WELL, I GUESS IF YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.887
NO NO NO.
IT'S JUST IT'S ONE OF MY
SUPER FAMOUS FRIEND'S PLACE.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.223
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN TELL YOU.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.659
- I KNOW I CAN'T.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.827
SINCE WE'RE FRIENDS,
I WILL.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.396
LET'S JUST SAY J-LO
DIDN'T WANNA RAISE

07:42.462 --> 07:45.365
HER ADORABLE LITTLE TWINS
IN THE CITY.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.734
WOW, THAT IS...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.970
UNBELIEVABLE.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.306
YEAH, I KNOW.
I'M NOT ONE TO BRAG,

07:52.372 --> 07:54.041
BUT I AM SUPER HOOKED UP.

07:54.107 --> 07:58.712
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ACTING.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.881
GEORGIA, WHAT ELSE
HAVE YOU BEEN IN?

08:00.948 --> 08:03.050
YOU JUST MISSED
MY LEAD PERFORMANCE

08:03.116 --> 08:06.954
IN "JESUS CHRIST
SUPERSTAR."

08:10.023 --> 08:12.659
SHE WAS THE FIRST
BLACK FEMALE JESUS.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.095
SHE KILLED AND SAVED.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.400
THAT KEY PARTY
WAS A BUST.

08:20.467 --> 08:23.670
I ENDED UP WITH
DICAPRIO'S PRIUS.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.974
I DITCHED THAT THING
IN THE LINCOLN TUNNEL
AND TOOK ME A CAB.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.845
- OH, RIGHT.
- WHO'S THIS?

08:31.912 --> 08:33.046
- THIS IS MY--
SHE IS--
- I'M HER--

08:33.113 --> 08:35.983
- PERSONAL TRAINER.
- REALLY?

08:36.049 --> 08:39.987
YES, I KNOW I COULD HAVE
BEEN A THOUSAND OTHER THINGS,

08:40.053 --> 08:43.290
BUT NOPE,
I'M A PERSONAL TRAINER.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.227
THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE IS THE BEST.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.596
YOU EVER HEARD OF THE
TRAINERS TO THE STARS?

08:49.663 --> 08:52.099
WELL, SHE IS THE TRAINER
TO THOSE TRAINERS.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.471
ANYWAY,
I SEE YOU'RE BUSY.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.674
I'M JUST GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND WARM UP THE TREADMILL.

09:01.842 --> 09:02.109
FEEL THE BURN.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.047
WOW, GEORGIA.
ACTING CAREER,
PERSONAL TRAINER

09:07.114 --> 09:10.717
AND J-LO'S APARTMENT.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.520
YOU REALLY
SEEM TO BE LIVING
THE GLAMOROUS LIFE.

09:13.587 --> 09:16.056
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
I WAS TALKING TO STEPH
THE OTHER DAY--

09:16.123 --> 09:20.360
LADY GAGA--
AND SHE WAS LIKE--

09:20.427 --> 09:23.864
I HEARD THAT STEPH
IS REALLY GOOD FRIENDS
WITH JASON DERULO.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.299
SO YOU MUST KNOW HIM TOO.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.568
J-DILLO?

09:27.634 --> 09:30.404
WE ARE SUPERTIGHT.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.906
SO YOU MUST BE GOING TO
HIS CONCERT TOMORROW
NIGHT THEN.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.041
WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE?
OF COURSE I AM.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.043
GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.879
I'LL BE SITTING
IN THE FOURTH ROW.
WHERE ARE YOU SITTING?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.949
MAN, I GOT
FRONT-ROW CENTER.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.051
OBVIOUSLY.

09:44.117 --> 09:47.087
( WHISPERS )
STOP SAYING WORDS.

09:49.656 --> 09:52.092
WELL, THAT IS
GREAT TO HEAR,

09:52.159 --> 09:54.895
BECAUSE THOSE TICKETS
WOULD COST, LIKE, $600

09:54.962 --> 09:56.930
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW JASON.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.299
BUT I DO SO...

09:59.366 --> 10:02.769
HOW ABOUT I STOP BY
TOMORROW NIGHT AND WE ALL
GO TO THE CONCERT TOGETHER?

10:02.836 --> 10:06.406
( PANTING )

10:06.473 --> 10:08.709
YEAH, I LOVE IT.
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

10:08.775 --> 10:11.512
- YEAH.
- ( BOTH SHRIEK )

10:11.578 --> 10:13.614
BOTH:
MWAH! MWAH!

10:14.114 --> 10:16.984
( SHRIEKS )

10:19.119 --> 10:22.656
SHE IS GOOD.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.802
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

10:35.869 --> 10:39.506
( CLEARS THROAT )
I WILL USE MY SOCIAL SKILLS

10:39.573 --> 10:41.909
TO CONNECT
THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENT

10:41.975 --> 10:44.678
TO THE NON-NERD WORLD.

10:47.614 --> 10:51.518
I SEE YOU'RE
SMILING, MR. GIRAFFE.
I SEE YOU'RE SMILING.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.353
JO, JO, GUESS--

10:53.420 --> 10:56.423
SORRY.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD COMPANY.

10:56.490 --> 10:59.660
I NEEDED AN IMAGINARY
AUDIENCE WHILE I WORKED

10:59.726 --> 11:01.562
ON MY SPEECH.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.498
AND THE IMAGINARY TEA
IS THE REFRESHMENT

11:04.565 --> 11:06.500
TO THANK THEM
FOR THEIR TIME.

11:06.567 --> 11:10.571
THE MORE YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN,
THE WORSE IT BECOMES.

11:12.472 --> 11:16.310
SO GUESS WHAT.
I FOUND FRONT-ROW TICKETS

11:16.376 --> 11:18.645
TO THE JASON DERULO CONCERT!

11:18.712 --> 11:21.014
( SCREAMING )

11:21.081 --> 11:23.016
AND IT WON'T COST $600?

11:23.083 --> 11:26.420
- NO!
- YAY!

11:26.486 --> 11:29.256
IT'S GONNA COST $900!

11:32.826 --> 11:34.428
I KNOW, I KNOW.
OKAY, LISTEN.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.231
THE CONCERT WAS SOLD OUT,
BUT I FOUND THIS GUY ONLINE.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.000
SO DON'T WORRY,
'CAUSE I HAVE A BRILLIANT PLAN

11:40.067 --> 11:42.669
SO WE CAN PAY FOR THE TICKETS.
PACK UP YOUR THINGS.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.037
NO, I'M STILL WORKING
ON MY SPEECH.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.739
JO, IT'S NOT GONNA
TAKE THAT LONG.
I PROMISE.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.609
THE TIME IS JUST
GONNA<i>FLY</i>BY.

11:48.675 --> 11:52.045
WAIT. WHY DID YOU
SAY FLY LIKE THAT?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.849
CLUCK CLUCK!
EAT AT CHUCK'S.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.819
GEORGIA, THERE'S NO WAY
THAT WE'RE GONNA GET
ENOUGH PEOPLE IN THERE

11:58.886 --> 12:00.654
TO AFFORD THOSE TICKETS.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.656
IT'S BEEN 20 MINUTES.
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME IN?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.607
OKAY, I DON'T THINK IT COUNTS
IF THEY DON'T BUY ANYTHING.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.043
YOU KNOW WHAT DOES COUNT?
THIS THING.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.479
I KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS

12:38.158 --> 12:41.094
I GOT PEOPLE TRASHING
MY BATHROOM AND HARASSING
MY WAITRESSES.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.729
NOBODY'S BUYING ANYTHING.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.698

- CAN WE GO HOME NOW?
- NO, IF I COULD JUST
TALK TO JASON,

13:55.235 --> 13:57.137
I'M SURE
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
JASON!

13:57.204 --> 13:59.039
I DON'T THINK YOU
COULD JUST WALK UP
TO HIM LIKE THIS.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.542
IT'S OKAY.
JASON, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU PRIVATELY,

14:01.608 --> 14:05.679
- JUST YOU AND ME.
- UH-OH, CRAZY GIRL
IN A CHICKEN SUIT.

14:05.746 --> 14:07.347
I GOTTA GET OUT
OF THIS CLUSTERMESS.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.816
NO, I LOOK CRAZY
JUST BECAUSE I HAVE THIS ON,

14:09.883 --> 14:12.319
BUT I'M REALLY NOT CRAZY.
YOU SHOULD IMAGINE ME
WITHOUT IT.

14:12.386 --> 14:15.055
THAT JUST CAME OUT WRONG.
JASON, NO, LISTEN, HERE.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.690
I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, OKAY?

14:16.757 --> 14:18.926
( SHRIEKS )

14:20.761 --> 14:22.262
I'M NOT WITH HER.

14:22.329 --> 14:25.299
IT'S A TOTAL COINCIDENCE,
THE CHICKEN SUIT THING.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.607
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT
ABOUT THREE HOURS

14:33.674 --> 14:36.810
UNTIL THE CONCERT STARTS.
LET'S THINK.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.146
NO, YOU THINK.
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL

14:39.213 --> 14:40.814
AS SOON AS I CAN CHANGE
INTO SOME REGULAR CLOTHES.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.549

A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.

14:42.616 --> 14:44.551
OKAY, LISTEN, WE NEED

14:47.921 --> 14:51.525
I'VE SPENT THE WHOLE DAY
DOING YOUR STUFF.

14:51.592 --> 14:53.760
NOW I HAVE TO GO GIVE
MY HALF-WRITTEN SPEECH.

14:53.827 --> 14:56.697
NO NO, JO, NO.
JO, THIS IS REALLY
REALLY IMPORTANT.

14:56.763 --> 15:00.300
WHY IS IMPRESSING KELLY
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY
PHYSICS LIAISON ELECTION?

15:00.367 --> 15:02.736
BECAUSE SHE MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE I'M NOTHING.

15:02.803 --> 15:04.438
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE
MAKING ME FEEL RIGHT NOW.

15:04.505 --> 15:06.540
OH, STOP IT, JO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:06.607 --> 15:09.276
YOU KEEP ACTING LIKE
YOUR STUFF IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN MY STUFF,

15:09.343 --> 15:12.179
- AND THAT SUCKS.
- OKAY, I'M HEARING YOU.

15:12.246 --> 15:15.315
I AM, BUT YOU KNOW,
I GOT A TIMELINE

15:15.382 --> 15:17.451
ON THIS CONCERT THING,
RIGHT?

15:18.719 --> 15:21.688
NO, YOU ARE NOT
HEARING ME.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.390
I GOTTA GO.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.973
AND IF YOU VOTE FOR ME,

15:40.040 --> 15:43.110
I WILL BUILD A BRIDGE
TO THE NON-NERD WORLD.

15:46.180 --> 15:47.981
THANK YOU.

15:48.048 --> 15:51.618
THAT'S IT?
YOUR WHOLE SPEECH
IS ONE SENTENCE?

15:51.685 --> 15:53.754
THAT'S ALL I HAD TIME
TO PERFECT.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.823
BUT IF YOU ELECT ME,
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT.

15:56.890 --> 16:00.360
NO NO, THAT CAME OUT BAD.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.095
VOTE FOR ME.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.968
ALL I GOTTA SAY
IS THIS.

16:20.280 --> 16:23.250
MY MOM SAID THAT IT'S RUDE
TO VOTE FOR YOURSELF.

16:24.585 --> 16:27.221
WELL, THAT'S IT.
CONGRATULATIONS, SETH.

16:29.223 --> 16:31.024
SORRY YOU DIDN'T
GET ELECTED, JO.

16:31.091 --> 16:34.194
THAT'S OKAY.
JUST KIND OF BUMMED.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.063
I GUESS BEING
STUDENT LIAISON

16:36.129 --> 16:38.365
WAS A BIGGER DEAL TO ME
THAN I THOUGHT.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.768
WHY? IT'S JUST
A POPULARITY CONTEST.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.437
NERDS DON'T EVEN RESPECT
POPULAR PEOPLE.

16:43.504 --> 16:45.105
I THINK LESS
OF SETH ALREADY.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.840
ME TOO.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.976
( WHISPERS )
NOT REALLY.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.144
I GUESS I JUST LIKED IT

16:51.211 --> 16:54.114
WHEN YOU GUYS THOUGHT THAT 
I WAS THE COOLEST ONE HERE.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.884
WOW. WE DIDN'T EVEN
THINK YOU CARED.

16:56.950 --> 16:59.219
NEITHER DID I,

16:59.286 --> 17:01.855
BUT YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S
THAT ONE COOL THING
IN YOUR LIFE?

17:01.922 --> 17:04.558
IT'S JUST REALLY CRAPPY
TO HAVE IT TAKEN AWAY.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.426
I STILL THINK
YOU'RE COOL, JO.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.897
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE OF US
THAT'S REACHED LEVEL 23
ON "DWARF QUEST 4."

17:12.199 --> 17:14.568
TODAY HAS BEEN
SUCH A CLUSTER--

17:14.635 --> 17:17.905
( GASPS )
CLUSTERMESS.

17:17.971 --> 17:21.008
OH MY GOSH.
I THINK I KNOW HOW
I CAN HELP GEORGIA.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.143
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.
YOU'RE THE BEST.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.012
YOU'RE THE BEST.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.147

WE'RE THE BEST.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.184
DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP.
SMART WOMEN DON'T DATE JOCKS.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.153

17:33.220 --> 17:36.156
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
REALLY GOOD LISTENERS.

-<i>( KNOCK ON DOOR )</i>
- COME IN.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.137
GEORGIA, YOU DON'T
LOOK READY TO SEE YOUR
B.F.F. JASON DERULO.

17:50.204 --> 17:52.005
I'M NOT
GOING TO THE CONCERT.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.141
I LIED ABOUT
HAVING TICKETS.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.009
AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THAT,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.612
I REALLY SCREWED
THINGS UP WITH JO.

17:58.679 --> 18:01.815
SO THIS IS MY LIFE NOW--

18:03.283 --> 18:06.153
HARD LEMONADE,

18:06.220 --> 18:10.224
SOGGY PIZZA
IN MY AUNT'S APARTMENT

18:10.290 --> 18:12.593
IN A CHICKEN SUIT.

18:14.962 --> 18:18.498
I KNEW IT.
I TOLD THE GIRLS BACK HOME
SHE IS NOT ALL THAT,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.634
AND I WILL PROVE IT.

18:20.701 --> 18:22.269
SEEING YOU LIKE THIS,

18:22.336 --> 18:25.172
I GET WHY YOU ALWAYS HUNG OUT
WITH SOMEONE LIKE JO.

18:25.239 --> 18:27.608
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:27.674 --> 18:31.211
EVEN THOUGH MY LIFE
ISN'T THE COOLEST
RIGHT NOW,

18:33.013 --> 18:36.049
AND EVEN ON MY BROKEST,
LAMEST,

18:36.116 --> 18:37.885
MOST UNCOOL DAYS,

18:37.951 --> 18:41.188
I STILL HAVE SOMEBODY
WHO WILL RUN THE STREETS
OF NEW YORK WITH ME

18:41.255 --> 18:43.190
IN A CHICKEN SUIT.

18:43.257 --> 18:45.259
DO YOU HAVE ANYONE
TO DO THAT FOR YOU?

18:52.165 --> 18:55.869
THANKS.
HUGS.

19:00.073 --> 19:03.010
THAT SUIT'S GETTING
KIND OF GAMEY.

19:04.211 --> 19:07.147
I CAN'T WAIT TO FLY HOME
TOMORROW NIGHT

19:07.214 --> 19:10.017
AND TELL EVERYONE HOW GREAT
YOU'RE DOING, GEORGIA,

19:10.083 --> 19:13.020

19:31.805 --> 19:35.209
YEAH, WE ARE,

19:35.275 --> 19:38.612
WHY DO YOU KEEP MENTIONING
MY LAST NAME IF WE'RE SUCH
GOOD FRIENDS, GEORGIA?

19:40.080 --> 19:42.249
I DON'T KNOW,
JASON DERULO.

19:43.584 --> 19:47.254
SO YOU REALLY DO KNOW--

19:47.321 --> 19:49.890

IN THE HOUSE?

20:07.608 --> 20:11.178
WHEN I HEARD JASON SHOUTING
AT THE RADIO STATION,

20:11.245 --> 20:13.180
I KNEW THAT I'D HEARD
THAT VOICE BEFORE.

20:13.247 --> 20:15.249
HE IS NOT ONLY
AN INCREDIBLE SINGER,

20:15.315 --> 20:19.253
BUT HE'S ALSO A LEVEL 23
"DWARF QUEST 4" PLAYER.

20:21.922 --> 20:23.724
THANKS FOR DOING
ALL THIS, BUDDY.

20:23.790 --> 20:26.026
- JASON: SO LET'S GO. 
- WHAT? I'M SORRY.

20:26.093 --> 20:28.228
I ZONED OUT
AFTER "DWARF QUEST 4."
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

20:28.295 --> 20:30.097
WE'RE GOING
TO MY CONCERT.

20:30.163 --> 20:33.467
OKAY, WELL, LET ME JUST CHANGE
INTO SOMETHING A LITTLE
LESS FEATHERY.

20:33.534 --> 20:35.102
WE'RE KIND OF RUNNING LATE.

20:35.169 --> 20:37.237
NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I GOT THIS.

20:39.106 --> 20:42.509
MY NAME IS GEORGIA CHAMBERLAIN.
IF I CAN'T MAKE A CHICKEN
SUIT WORK,

20:42.576 --> 20:45.179
THEN I MIGHT AS WELL
JUST HANG IT UP AND GO HOME.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.481
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:47.548 --> 20:50.317
TRUST ME.
THEY'LL BE WEARING THIS
IN MILAN NEXT SEASON.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.329
TAG THAT ONE
SO KELLY IS SURE

21:02.396 --> 21:03.964
TO SEE US DANCING
ON STAGE WITH HIM.

21:04.031 --> 21:05.599
I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA FAINT.

21:05.666 --> 21:08.035
YOU? I WAS IN
A CHICKEN SUIT UNDER
100 LIGHTS.

21:09.937 --> 21:12.005
I TRIED TO COOL YOU DOWN
WITH MY SPRINKLER.

21:12.072 --> 21:13.674
( IMITATES WATER SPRINKLER )

21:13.740 --> 21:17.845
AT THAT MOMENT,
I WAS THE SECOND LAMEST
PERSON ON STAGE.

21:17.911 --> 21:20.814
EXCUSE US, GIRLS.
WE'RE OUT OF CHAMPAGNE.

21:20.881 --> 21:24.218
OH! TAG, YOU'RE IT.
