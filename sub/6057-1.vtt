00:45.129 --> 00:48.466
<i>This is a story from long ago,</i>

00:48.549 --> 00:52.136
<i>when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands.</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:57.892
<i>It's the story
of my two brothers and me.</i>

00:58.476 --> 01:00.352
<i>When the three of us were young,</i>

01:00.436 --> 01:04.106
<i>we were taught
that the world is full of magie.</i>

01:09.487 --> 01:13.282
<i>The source of this magic
is the ever-changing lights</i>

01:13.324 --> 01:15.576
<i>that dance across the sky.</i>

01:19.246 --> 01:21.123
<i>The shaman woman of our village</i>

01:21.165 --> 01:25.211
<i>told us that these lights
are the spirits of our ancestors,</i>

01:25.294 --> 01:29.840
<i>and that they have the power
to make changes in our world.</i>

01:33.427 --> 01:36.055
<i>Small things become big.</i>

01:38.516 --> 01:40.684
<i>Winter turns to spring.</i>

01:43.938 --> 01:47.525
<i>One thing always changes
into another.</i>

01:49.527 --> 01:52.780
<i>But the greatest change I ever saw</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:54.740
<i>was that of my brother,</i>

01:55.366 --> 02:00.371
<i>a boy who desperately
wanted to be a man.</i>

02:03.541 --> 02:05.709
- Get down.
-What?

02:06.043 --> 02:08.003
Get down! Get down!

02:14.885 --> 02:16.303
Kenai.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.742
Never try to milk a caribou.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.750
No. No, don't. No. Come on, don't. No.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.253
Hey. Will you two knock it off?

02:49.753 --> 02:52.923
That's all right.
After today, he won't treat me like that.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.135
Right, the big manhood ceremony.

02:56.552 --> 03:00.014
Doesn't matter what the spirits say,
you'll always be our baby brother.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.975
- Well, wait till I get my totem.
-Baby brother.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.770
Hey, I said knock it off.

03:06.854 --> 03:10.107
The quicker we get these fish,
the faster we getto your ceremony.

03:10.191 --> 03:14.069
Let's all just try and get along
for a few hours. Okay, Denahi?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.405
- Whatever you say.
-Okay, Ken...

03:16.447 --> 03:18.782
<i>So, what are we wamng fior'?</i>

03:28.334 --> 03:33.297
<i>When the Earth was young
and the air was sweet</i>

03:33.672 --> 03:38.135
<i>And the mountains kissed the sky</i>

03:39.470 --> 03:42.223
<i>In the great beyond</i>

03:42.306 --> 03:44.642
<i>With its man y paths</i>

03:44.683 --> 03:48.646
<i>Man and nature lived side by side</i>

03:50.481 --> 03:54.693
<i>In this wilderness of danger and beauty</i>

03:55.861 --> 03:59.990
<i>Lived three brothers bonded by love</i>

04:01.867 --> 04:04.828
<i>Their hearts full ofjoy</i>

04:04.912 --> 04:07.331
<i>They ask now for guidance</i>

04:07.414 --> 04:11.752
<i>Reaching out to the skies up above</i>

04:12.962 --> 04:16.006
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

04:16.048 --> 04:18.842
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:23.305
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

04:24.515 --> 04:27.184
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

04:27.268 --> 04:29.353
<i>We are aH the same</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:34.692
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

04:35.317 --> 04:37.778
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

04:37.861 --> 04:42.032
<i>Give us wisdom to pass to each other</i>

04:43.325 --> 04:47.204
<i>And give us strength so we understand</i>

04:49.290 --> 04:52.209
<i>That the things we do</i>

04:52.251 --> 04:54.420
<i>The choices we make</i>

04:54.503 --> 04:58.340
<i>Give direction to all life's plans</i>

05:00.217 --> 05:04.722
<i>To look and wonder
at all we've been given</i>

05:05.639 --> 05:09.977
<i>In a world that's not always as it seems</i>

05:11.603 --> 05:14.315
<i>Every corner we turn</i>

05:14.398 --> 05:16.942
<i>Only leads to another</i>

05:17.026 --> 05:21.405
<i>A journey ends but another begins</i>

05:22.740 --> 05:25.826
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

05:25.909 --> 05:28.579
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

05:28.662 --> 05:32.916
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

05:34.251 --> 05:36.962
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

05:37.046 --> 05:39.048
<i>We are aH the same</i>

05:39.840 --> 05:44.595
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

05:45.095 --> 05:47.222
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

05:47.431 --> 05:49.808
- Kenai's back.
-Kenai.

05:49.892 --> 05:53.479
Kenai, are you excited
about getting your spirit rock today?

05:53.812 --> 05:56.774
It's nota rock. It'll be my totem.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.362
I'll probably get a sabre-tooth tiger
for bravery,

06:01.445 --> 06:03.405
or strength, or greatness.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.992
- Something that fits me.
- A mammoth for your fat head?

06:07.076 --> 06:10.120
- Make sure you get that basket tied up.
- Don't worry.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.748
No stupid bear
is gonna get near this fish.

06:12.790 --> 06:14.541
Just tie it up.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.877
Just tie it up.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.839
- She's back. Tanana's back.
- Come on.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.176
- Come on, Kenai, let's go.
- Come on.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.512
Tanana's got your rock. Come on.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.979
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

06:36.063 --> 06:38.357
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

06:38.440 --> 06:42.820
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

06:43.987 --> 06:46.698
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

06:46.782 --> 06:49.535
<i>We are aH the same</i>

06:49.618 --> 06:54.164
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

06:54.873 --> 06:57.876
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

06:57.960 --> 07:02.840
<i>Brothers all the same</i>

07:03.632 --> 07:04.842
Nana.

07:04.883 --> 07:09.555
- Hey, Nana.
-Well, hello there, sweetheart.

07:09.638 --> 07:12.015
What a big girl.

07:14.268 --> 07:20.107
<i>When each of us comes of age,
the great spirits reveals us a totem</i>

07:20.190 --> 07:23.068
that helps guide us through our lives.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.697
<i>Some of us use courage to guide us.</i>

07:27.990 --> 07:29.741
Others patience.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.788
And some of us beauty.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.209
Kenai.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.465
- You nervous?
-Excited.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.593
You should be. It's a good one.

07:48.427 --> 07:53.140
Kenai, I have been to the mountain
where the lights touch the earth,

07:53.223 --> 07:58.020
and the great spirits
have revealed to me your totem.

07:58.812 --> 08:04.693
<i>To become a man, your actions
must be guided by one thing.</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:09.490
Your totem is...

08:12.576 --> 08:13.911
Love.

08:14.995 --> 08:18.081
- What?
-Yes, love.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.210
The bear of love?

08:21.251 --> 08:25.797
A love that connects
and unites all living things.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.842
- Who wants to trade?
-There is no trading.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.595
Oh, Kenai,

08:32.054 --> 08:34.640
love is the most precious of totems.

08:34.723 --> 08:37.935
It reveals itself in unexpected ways.

08:38.644 --> 08:43.440
Let love guide your actions,
then one day you'll be a man,

08:44.066 --> 08:48.904
and we'll piace your mark
next to those of our ancestors.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.388
There he is.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.723
Come here, lover boy.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.476
- Leave me alone.
-Kenai, wait.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.813
- I'm sorry.
-What?

09:22.854 --> 09:25.482
Your totem, I think it's really great.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.277
- You do?
-Yeah. And I made you something.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.611
Really?

09:29.653 --> 09:32.489
Now when you skip around
loving everybody,

09:32.531 --> 09:35.200
you'll smell so sweet.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.160
Well, isn't this nice?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.621
Instead of fighting,
you're giving each other flowers.

09:39.663 --> 09:43.500
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch with his totem already.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.837
<i>Hey, dog breath,
go take care of the flsh.</i>

09:46.878 --> 09:50.007
Sure. Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

09:50.048 --> 09:53.927
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenail loves me, he loves...

09:54.011 --> 09:57.848
- Kenai.
-Someday I'm gonna just...

09:58.390 --> 10:00.601
- He's just such <i>a...</i>
- Hey, bonehead.

10:00.684 --> 10:03.854
Just because his totem is wisdom
doesn't mean he's wise.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.232
- I mean, look at him.
-Kenai loves me, he loves me not.

10:07.566 --> 10:09.693
- Hi, Denahi.
-Hi.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.529
Let go!

10:12.571 --> 10:15.532
<i>Yeah, the spirits messed up
on both our totems.</i>

10:15.574 --> 10:18.076
I felt the same way
when Tanana gave me mine.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.037
- Get out of here.
-No, really.

10:20.078 --> 10:24.207
I said, "The eagle of guidance?
What does that mean?"

10:24.291 --> 10:27.169
But now that I'm older,
I know it's about being a leader

10:27.210 --> 10:29.046
and keeping an eye on you two.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.759
I just want to get my handprint
on that wall.

10:33.842 --> 10:38.388
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem, you will.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.557
- Really?
-Guarantee it.

10:43.644 --> 10:47.147
But come on, the bear of love?

10:47.230 --> 10:49.358
I mean, a bear doesn't love anyone.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.402
They don't think. They don't feel.
I mean, they're...

10:54.613 --> 10:57.699
- They're thieves.
-You didn't tie it up, did you?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.577
You should get the totem of pinheads.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.870
<i>Stop it.</i>

11:01.912 --> 11:04.039
- We'll just make another basket.
- We?

11:04.081 --> 11:07.709
Oh, no. It took me two weeks
to make that basket.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.713
Get lover boy to do it.
He's the one always messing things up.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.050
- Typical Kenai.
-AIl right, I'll go get your basket.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.095
Kenai, wait. Kenai!

11:20.847 --> 11:22.432
What?

11:43.829 --> 11:44.996
Kenai!

11:47.958 --> 11:49.626
Kenai!

11:49.668 --> 11:52.754
- Where'd he go?
-If we're lucky, far away.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.593
Kenai!

12:01.888 --> 12:04.850
- Kenai.
-Sitka, no, you gotta get out of here.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.768
- What?
-The bear. Behind you.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.482
Hey, bear, come on. Over here.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.860
Come on, bear, come this way.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.791
Denahi!

12:30.876 --> 12:34.087
- Hold on.
-Pull.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.953
Sitka. Sitka!

13:32.020 --> 13:33.188
Sitka.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.661
Come on!

13:51.081 --> 13:53.166
- Sitka!
-Sitka!

13:55.168 --> 13:57.254
Sitka. Sitka!

13:57.295 --> 14:00.090
- Sitka?
-Sitka, where are you?

14:01.132 --> 14:02.133
Kenai.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.688
No.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.858
Sitka!

14:19.693 --> 14:21.236
Sitka!

14:23.280 --> 14:25.448
Denahi, let's find him!

14:25.490 --> 14:26.825
Sitka.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.662
Sitka, where are you? Sitka!

15:33.183 --> 15:36.102
<i>- You ready?
- For what?</i>

15:36.186 --> 15:38.188
For going after the bear.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.860
I know what you're feeling,
but killing that bear is wrong.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.781
Wrong? Our brother is dead
and it's because of that monster.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.742
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.

15:55.538 --> 15:58.792
- I see.
- Killing the bear won't make you a man.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.210
<i>Now you're trying to be wise.</i>

16:00.251 --> 16:03.046
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you?

16:03.129 --> 16:06.216
You really think love
has anything to do with being a man?

16:06.257 --> 16:09.302
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.515
Kenai. Don't upset the spirits.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.477
<i>Spirits. Thanks for your wisdom.</i>

16:42.919 --> 16:44.546
I've got to stop him.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.390
You left too soon, Sitka.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.018
Your brothers need your guidance.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.759
Kenai.

20:38.655 --> 20:39.822
What?

21:53.313 --> 21:54.564
Sitka.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.332
No.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.140
<i>I don 't blame the bear, Kenai.</i>

23:55.518 --> 23:58.563
<i>A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.</i>

24:49.447 --> 24:53.743
So, Kenai,
you've decided to join the living.

24:54.577 --> 24:56.287
That's quite a bump you've got.

24:56.370 --> 24:59.290
<i>That must have been one heck of a flde
down the rapids.</i>

24:59.624 --> 25:00.791
Tanana?

25:06.506 --> 25:08.257
Nana, you won't believe this.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.760
I was at the top of this rock,
and all of a sudden...

25:14.430 --> 25:15.765
Kenai, honey.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.684
I don't speak bear.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.608
No.

25:26.484 --> 25:29.278
No, no! No!

25:33.366 --> 25:37.662
All right! All right! All right!
Would you settle down? Settle!

25:37.745 --> 25:40.790
Kenai! Kenai...

25:40.873 --> 25:44.835
Kenai. Kenai. This isn't going to work.

25:47.964 --> 25:51.717
<i>Kenai, listen to me. Sitka did this.</i>

25:53.636 --> 25:57.807
Strange. Spirits don't usually
make these kind of changes.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.768
Oh, my, my, my, my...

26:00.810 --> 26:04.021
Sitka must have something really big
planned for you. Yep, yep.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.774
You are going to get
a whole new perspective on things.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.320
Do you see in black and white
or colour?

26:11.362 --> 26:14.949
<i>Hey. Listen to me.
You go yourself into this mess.</i>

26:14.991 --> 26:18.327
If you want to change,
take it up with your brother's spirit.

26:20.496 --> 26:24.750
You'll find him on the mountain
where the lights touch the earth.

26:24.834 --> 26:27.503
He'll help you make up
for what you've done wrong.

26:27.587 --> 26:30.339
But I didn't do anything wrong.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.259
Tanana? Tanana!

26:33.342 --> 26:36.262
Wait. I didn't do anything wrong.

26:37.388 --> 26:40.016
- I don't even know how to get there.
-What happened to them?

26:40.057 --> 26:43.352
- I don't know.
-They were here. Now they're gone.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.396
Yeah, that's pretty weird.

26:45.855 --> 26:49.692
So you're telling me you didn't eat them
and you have no idea where they are?

26:50.693 --> 26:53.362
Hey, hey, you. You just talked.

26:53.404 --> 26:56.616
Just back away, real slow-like.

26:56.699 --> 27:00.369
- How did you do that?
-I knew you had them.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.830
<i>Are we arrrived yet?</i>

27:02.872 --> 27:05.625
Don't make me
turn this formation around.

27:06.876 --> 27:11.130
Hey. Wait. Come back.
I'm trying to find where the lights...

27:11.213 --> 27:15.843
- What's he getting worked up about?
- Maybe the goose pooped on him?

27:17.720 --> 27:20.139
He's looking over here.
Let's beat it. This way.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.309
- No, this way.
-Thank you very much.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.895
- Just stay still and...
- Hey, you two!

27:26.354 --> 27:28.064
Head down.

27:28.105 --> 27:30.066
I think he's seen us. Now what?

27:30.107 --> 27:32.902
- Act like we're not here.
- We're not here.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.237
- What are you doing?
- You said <i>to...</i>

27:35.279 --> 27:37.031
- Don't say anything.
- Okay.

27:37.073 --> 27:38.407
- I said, "Don't say anything."
- Excuse me.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.995
- Don't eat us.
- You won't like us, eh? We're gamey.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.081
Yeah. Eat hoof-for-brains over there.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.750
- Pine-cone breath.
- Crusty tail.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.294
- Twig legs.
-Big nose.

27:50.378 --> 27:52.713
- Sorry.
-You went too far that time.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.674
- Okay, I'm sorry.
-Guys.

27:54.757 --> 27:58.094
- Yours is bigger than mine.
-I'm not eating anybody.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.807
- That's mighty decent of you, eh.
-My name's Rutt.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.101
- This is my brother Tuke.
-How's it going, Bear?

28:05.851 --> 28:09.063
- Don't call me that.
-Sorry...

28:10.022 --> 28:13.818
- Mr Bear?
-I mean, I'm nota bear. I hate bears.

28:13.901 --> 28:17.947
- Well, gee, you're one big beaver.
-No kidding, eh?

28:18.322 --> 28:21.117
Do either of you know
where the lights touch the earth?

28:24.453 --> 28:27.957
No. No. Sorry, bear... Beaver.

28:27.998 --> 28:31.627
I'm not a beaver, I'm a bear...
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.921
- I'm a man.
-Excuse me.

28:33.963 --> 28:36.590
I was transformed into a bear.

28:36.632 --> 28:40.302
Magically. I was lifted into the sky
by my brother.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.098
- Crazy.
-Gesundheit.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.225
No. Fruitcake.

28:46.308 --> 28:49.228
- Are you okay?
-No. That bear. Over there.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.522
- He's crazy.
-I am not crazy.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.859
Whoever said you were?
We understand.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.111
- You do?
-Yeah, yeah.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.280
You see, we're not moose either.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.823
- We're not?
-No.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.285
We're like squirrels. Yeah.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.079
Yeah. Beauty, eh?

29:07.163 --> 29:11.959
Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.502
<i>Look at these cuspids.</i>

29:14.670 --> 29:18.632
- Give him a little room.
- Why am I talking to moose?

29:18.674 --> 29:21.218
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.346
I'll find it myself.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.767
- I wouldn't go that way.
-Why not, eh?

29:28.726 --> 29:30.853
Well, there was a reason.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.272
- You brought it up.
- I'm trying <i>to...</i>

29:41.655 --> 29:45.367
- So, you think of it yet?
-Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.052
Hey. Is the coast clear?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.888
- What?
-Are there any hunters around?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.891
- No.
- od!

30:08.933 --> 30:11.185
You didn't see the trap?

30:11.227 --> 30:15.272
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.607
Don't worry.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.069
I won't tell anyone.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.655
- What?
-You need to get down. Let me help.

30:22.738 --> 30:23.823
Oh, wait.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.992
- Hold still.
-Just... Stop that.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.161
If you just...

30:29.578 --> 30:32.122
- Stop it!
-It's no use.

30:32.498 --> 30:36.877
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

30:36.919 --> 30:40.881
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

30:40.965 --> 30:43.259
- Okay, here.
-No, I'll do it myself.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.928
<i>Put it back. No, where you found it.</i>

30:46.512 --> 30:48.889
To the left. By the little rock.

30:48.931 --> 30:50.349
- Here?
- Yes.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.809
<i>Okay! -</i>

30:52.935 --> 30:55.563
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

30:55.604 --> 30:58.691
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.025
All kinds of trees.

31:00.109 --> 31:05.865
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

31:05.948 --> 31:08.075
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

31:08.117 --> 31:11.787
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.589
See? It's all about using your head.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.511
That was funny. Do it again.

31:27.595 --> 31:31.265
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.437
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.481
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.985
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

31:43.068 --> 31:46.113
- Salmon run.
-Whatever. But if you can't...

31:46.405 --> 31:50.492
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.328
- You swear?
-Yeah.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.331
- Pinkie swear?
-Yeah, sure, fine, pinkie swear.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.334
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.502
There's no way
you're going to be able...

32:06.175 --> 32:09.094
Okay, so I'm thinking
we travel by day and sleep by night.

32:09.178 --> 32:12.014
My bedtime is an hour after sunset...

32:14.183 --> 32:15.517
<i>Rum!</i>

32:16.018 --> 32:17.811
Yeah, good riddance.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.203
Denahi.

32:34.244 --> 32:35.663
Denahi, you found me.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.500
You wouldn't believe
what a nightmare this has been.

32:41.210 --> 32:43.545
Denahi? It's me. Kenai.

33:16.704 --> 33:18.539
Is he gone?

33:18.580 --> 33:20.416
I think he was going...

33:28.632 --> 33:30.759
Hello. I can't breathe.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.652
- Why is he chasing me?
- That's what they do.

33:48.736 --> 33:52.448
- But it's not like him.
- Lucky for him, he didn't find us

33:52.531 --> 33:55.325
'cause when I get in a fight,
I go all crazy

33:55.409 --> 33:57.870
and I'm a raging ball of brown fur.

33:58.871 --> 34:02.833
I mean, I don't want to brag or nothing,
but I got some moves.

34:03.292 --> 34:06.754
- Really?
- Yep. This first one, well...

34:07.337 --> 34:10.924
It's just a little thing
I like to call "The Slasher."

34:10.966 --> 34:15.554
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death."

34:16.972 --> 34:19.141
- He's coming back.
-Where?

34:20.267 --> 34:21.894
Tvpical.

34:21.977 --> 34:25.230
Yeah, well,
the next time we run into that hunter...

34:25.314 --> 34:28.984
There is no "we."
I'm not taking you to any salmon run.

34:29.193 --> 34:31.653
<i>What? But you pinkie swore.</i>

34:31.737 --> 34:33.489
Yeah, well, things change.

34:34.323 --> 34:35.824
See you, kid.

34:37.493 --> 34:38.577
Wait...

34:42.206 --> 34:46.001
The truth is,
I got separated from my mom.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.796
And now, with this hunter around...

34:48.837 --> 34:52.925
- Kid, I got my own problems.
- Come on. Please.

34:53.008 --> 34:56.887
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears and a ton of fish,

34:56.970 --> 35:00.599
and every night we watch the lights
touch the mountain. Last year...

35:00.682 --> 35:03.685
- Wait, wait. What did you say?
-Lots of bears and fish.

35:03.727 --> 35:06.105
No. You know
where the lights touch the earth?

35:06.188 --> 35:09.149
Yeah! The top of the mountain
right by the salmon run.

35:09.191 --> 35:12.736
<i>- Are you kidding me?
- No, no, they're practically next door.</i>

35:12.820 --> 35:15.197
Come on, I'll show you. It'll be great.

35:16.240 --> 35:19.785
I promise to help you escape
from every trap you walk into.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.578
I'm not going to walk into any more...

35:22.996 --> 35:27.084
- Traps.
-Come on. What do you say?

35:28.877 --> 35:31.505
<i>Sure you can take me
to where the lights touch the earth?</i>

35:31.547 --> 35:33.382
Yeah, no problem.

35:39.012 --> 35:42.182
- If you slow me down...
-I won't, I promise.

35:43.308 --> 35:45.811
All right, we leave first thing tomorrow.

35:59.241 --> 36:02.202
And keep all that cuddly bear stuff
to a minimum, okay, kid?

36:02.244 --> 36:05.205
My name's not "kid." It's Koda.

36:13.046 --> 36:14.673
What's your name?

36:20.554 --> 36:22.264
- Good day.
-How's it going, eh?

36:22.347 --> 36:26.685
Beauty. So we gota lotto get done
today. You want to get started?

36:26.768 --> 36:28.770
- Yeah. Just give me one sec, eh?
-Okay.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.651
- Just help me crack this.
- All right.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.614
- You ready now?
- Almost.

36:40.449 --> 36:42.993
Just want to do "dog facing fon/vard."

36:44.077 --> 36:47.080
- Come on.
- Good. Okay.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.749
And go.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.419
<i>This a nice patch here.</i>

36:52.461 --> 36:55.964
Don't go near this patch here.
Something went here.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.299
<i>Skinny. Fat. Skinny. Fat.</i>

37:39.341 --> 37:42.344
Hey, I've got a mountain to get to.
Come on, kid.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.889
I told you before. My name's Koda.

37:45.973 --> 37:48.976
Say it with me. <i>Ko...</i> da.

37:49.017 --> 37:52.020
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko-duh?

38:00.529 --> 38:03.365
- Rutt.
- Go away, I'm eating twigs.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.702
- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.538
We should start running, like now!

38:09.621 --> 38:14.042
I can't. I'm still digesting. I'll get cramps.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.468
- He's after us!
- Come on, little brother.

38:24.386 --> 38:25.887
Cramp!

38:26.888 --> 38:30.350
If you really want to know
how me and my mom got separated...

38:30.392 --> 38:34.896
I was saving this story
for the salmon run, but I'll tell you.

38:36.398 --> 38:41.236
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.406
<i>Sounds good. You shold save it.
- You think so?</i>

38:44.489 --> 38:46.908
Yeah. For your friends.

38:47.576 --> 38:50.078
- Well, I have this other story.
-Tell you what.

38:50.412 --> 38:53.290
- How about no talking?
-Okay.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.709
- Then I'll sing.
- No, no, no.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.378
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

38:58.420 --> 38:59.796
Will you stop it?

38:59.880 --> 39:01.840
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

39:01.923 --> 39:03.592
<i>Come on, quit it.</i>

39:03.633 --> 39:05.469
Koda, stop singing.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.972
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

39:09.056 --> 39:13.435
<i>And there's nowhere else
that I'd rather be</i>

39:14.644 --> 39:18.565
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

39:18.607 --> 39:22.444
<i>And I'm loving every step I take</i>

39:23.111 --> 39:27.449
<i>With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

39:27.991 --> 39:31.953
<i>And I can't keep this smile off my face</i>

39:32.537 --> 39:37.167
<i>'Cause there's nothing like
seeing each other again</i>

39:37.501 --> 39:41.213
<i>No matterwhat the distance between</i>

39:42.089 --> 39:48.678
<i>And the stories that we tell
will make you smile</i>

39:49.012 --> 39:52.724
<i>Oh, it really lifts my heart</i>

39:52.808 --> 39:56.311
<i>So tell them all I'm on my way</i>

39:56.395 --> 40:00.690
<i>New friends and new places to see</i>

40:00.774 --> 40:05.695
<i>And to sleep under the stars
Who could ask for more?</i>

40:05.779 --> 40:09.324
<i>With the moon keeping watch over me</i>

40:10.117 --> 40:15.163
<i>Not the snow, not the rain
can change my mind</i>

40:15.205 --> 40:19.501
<i>The sun will come out, wait and see</i>

40:19.543 --> 40:23.338
<i>And the feeling of the wind in your face</i>

40:23.422 --> 40:27.175
<i>Can lift your heart, whoa</i>

40:27.217 --> 40:30.303
<i>There's nowhere I would rather be</i>

40:32.806 --> 40:35.517
<i>'Cause I'm on my way now</i>

40:37.769 --> 40:40.063
<i>Well and true</i>

40:42.524 --> 40:44.818
<i>I'm on my way now</i>

40:46.027 --> 40:48.363
Hey, hold on, eh?

40:48.447 --> 40:49.573
Wait up.

40:51.950 --> 40:55.162
- How's it going, bear boy?
-And smallish bear.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.581
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

40:57.664 --> 41:01.585
- Actually, he's...
-There was this hunter following us.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.880
We was thinking ifwe could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.549
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.886
- If the hunter was going to catch <i>up...</i>
- Then you'd eat him.

41:10.969 --> 41:14.556
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.516
You don't think he'll follow those?

41:17.100 --> 41:21.313
- They are quite nice.
-I've got an idea.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.899
Okay, this is really weird.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.236
- I'm driving.
-When can I have a turn?

41:28.278 --> 41:31.406
It's not as easy as it looks.
Just watch what I do.

41:31.490 --> 41:35.076
Let's get a back seat or something.
I look like you hunted me.

41:35.744 --> 41:38.788
<i>Tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

41:38.872 --> 41:40.165
Hey, come on.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.126
<i>And I just can't wait to be there</i>

41:44.920 --> 41:48.924
<i>Blue skies ahead
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

41:49.549 --> 41:54.012
<i>Nothing but good times to share</i>

41:54.095 --> 41:57.766
<i>So tell everybody I'm on my way</i>

41:58.683 --> 42:01.937
<i>And I just can't wait to be home</i>

42:03.396 --> 42:07.692
<i>With the sun beating down
Yes, I'm on my way</i>

42:08.276 --> 42:12.239
<i>With nothing but good times to show</i>

42:12.280 --> 42:15.700
<i>I'm on my way</i>

42:15.784 --> 42:19.579
<i>Yes, I'm on my way</i>

42:20.664 --> 42:22.123
Beauty, eh?

42:23.458 --> 42:27.087
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.589
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.299
I learned that one the hard way.

42:31.633 --> 42:35.971
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

42:36.054 --> 42:39.140
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.101
<i>Then 'ne started 'Lo floaî away.</i>

42:41.142 --> 42:43.979
<i>To save him
they had to cut off his tongue,</i>

42:44.020 --> 42:46.982
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

42:47.065 --> 42:48.942
Do you ever stop talking?

42:49.985 --> 42:52.487
Look. The night rainbow.

42:52.529 --> 42:56.658
- You can see the spirits from here.
-You know about the great spirits?

42:56.741 --> 42:59.995
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

43:01.162 --> 43:04.749
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

43:04.958 --> 43:08.670
Like how the leaves change colour,
or the moon changes shapes,

43:08.712 --> 43:12.382
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.

43:12.465 --> 43:17.012
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

43:17.053 --> 43:20.056
- What do you mean?
-My brother's a spirit.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.059
If it wasn't for him, <i>I...</i>

43:23.143 --> 43:25.020
I wouldn't be here.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.314
<i>You 'nave a 'orother up 'mere'?</i>

43:28.940 --> 43:32.736
- What happened to him?
- He was killed by <i>a...</i>

43:34.195 --> 43:36.197
By a monster.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.788
What's your brother's name?

43:43.872 --> 43:45.999
Sitka.

43:46.041 --> 43:50.295
Thanks, Sitka. If it weren't for you,
I would have never met Kenai.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.345
I always wanted a brother.

44:18.239 --> 44:20.408
So, you want to play "I spy"?

44:20.992 --> 44:23.411
- All right. I'll go first.
- Okay.

44:23.495 --> 44:27.290
I spy something green.

44:29.584 --> 44:30.877
Tree?

44:30.919 --> 44:32.128
- My turn?
- Yeah.

44:32.212 --> 44:35.215
Okay, I spy something tall.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.218
- Tree.
-Okay.

44:38.718 --> 44:43.348
I spy something with bark.

44:43.431 --> 44:44.766
Tree?

44:44.808 --> 44:46.851
Okay, I spy something...

44:47.560 --> 44:49.896
- A vertical log.
- Tree.

44:50.605 --> 44:53.274
- Okay, I spy something...
-Tree.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.151
- My turn.
-Tree.

44:55.235 --> 44:56.444
- No, <i>I...</i>
- It counts.

44:56.528 --> 44:58.863
- I didn't even spy anything.
-It counts.

44:58.947 --> 45:01.199
Okay. Tree.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.619
Let's play something else.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.837
Koda. Come on.

45:13.920 --> 45:17.215
- Koda, wake up.
- Two more months, Mom.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.887
So, where are we?

45:30.645 --> 45:32.689
Well, which way?

45:34.315 --> 45:37.318
- I think it's that way.
- You think, or you know?

45:38.361 --> 45:39.487
<i>That way?</i>

45:40.780 --> 45:42.991
Why wasn't I turned
into a homing pigeon?

45:43.241 --> 45:46.661
- Come on.
- Hey, riding mammoths was your idea.

45:46.745 --> 45:49.164
Thanks for the ride, guys. See you.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.750
Lucky for you,
I've been lost worse than this.

45:51.833 --> 45:55.003
- Last summer, I was with Bucky...
-Enough with the stories.

45:55.044 --> 45:57.464
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found

45:57.505 --> 46:00.049
the world's biggest pine cone ever.

46:00.133 --> 46:04.012
First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.556
<i>Second, it was not a pine come,
but was a pine nut.</i>

46:06.639 --> 46:09.684
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

46:10.143 --> 46:12.395
Our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

46:12.479 --> 46:14.856
Yeah. we'd better follow him. Come on.

46:14.939 --> 46:18.026
- Can you swing your leg...
-I can't get off.

46:18.067 --> 46:20.862
Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

46:20.904 --> 46:24.908
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys Iater, eh?

46:26.242 --> 46:27.827
- Good trip, eh?
- Beauty.

46:27.911 --> 46:31.790
You know, I was thinking now
might be a good time for me to drive.

46:31.873 --> 46:34.417
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

46:34.501 --> 46:36.211
Yeah. Okay.

46:39.088 --> 46:42.133
I'm sorry we're lost, okay?

46:42.217 --> 46:45.053
- Even though it's your fault.
- My fault?

46:45.386 --> 46:46.554
<i>That's enough.</i>

46:46.638 --> 46:50.308
Just remember, if it weren't for me,
you'd be hanging upside down.

46:50.391 --> 46:54.729
Better than being stuck nowhere
with you and your blabbering mouth.

46:54.771 --> 46:58.358
"I'm lost. I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me to the salmon run?"

46:58.399 --> 47:01.444
- Why don't you just grow up?
- Fine. I'll go on my own then.

47:01.528 --> 47:03.696
- Fine. Go ahead.
-Fine.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.073
- Fine.
- Fine.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.217
Koda?

47:24.926 --> 47:26.427
Koda?

48:31.367 --> 48:33.870
Those monsters are really scary.

48:35.121 --> 48:37.165
Especially with those sticks.

48:54.265 --> 48:56.476
Come on, let's go.

48:59.687 --> 49:01.022
So, you recognise anything yet?

49:01.439 --> 49:04.025
<i>Or maybe you can't see past
my fat head.</i>

49:07.111 --> 49:09.739
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?

49:09.822 --> 49:13.201
Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

49:13.284 --> 49:15.703
You mean like this?

49:15.745 --> 49:17.622
Or like this?

49:17.705 --> 49:19.707
How about this?

49:20.333 --> 49:22.877
<i>Oh, my, that was good.</i>

49:22.919 --> 49:25.046
Maybe they can give us directions.

49:27.215 --> 49:29.050
- That clears up the sinuses.
-Oh, it does.

49:29.092 --> 49:31.344
Okay, okay, hit me again.
I think she's looking.

49:31.386 --> 49:35.723
- Hello, sweetie.
-Yes, she's checking me out, all right.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.226
- Hey, baby.
-No, come on, you nitwit.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.603
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.

49:40.687 --> 49:43.648
Like she's looking at your ugly mug?
Come on.

49:43.731 --> 49:46.067
Excuse me, miss. It's go-time, baby.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.152
You want to go? Bring it on.

49:48.236 --> 49:49.904
- Horns up.
- Hold on.

49:50.238 --> 49:52.156
- Excuse me.
-What do you want?

49:52.991 --> 49:55.451
- What is that?
-Just a minute, bear.

49:55.535 --> 49:57.620
Hey, shut up.

49:58.246 --> 50:00.456
No, you shut up.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.750
No, you shut up.

50:02.792 --> 50:04.794
Hey, will you shut up?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.547
Just shut up.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.717
Their horns are screwed on too tight.

50:13.511 --> 50:15.096
Wait a second.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.725
- I know this place.
- You do?

50:18.766 --> 50:21.102
Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

50:22.020 --> 50:24.480
<i>We've just to go through there.</i>

50:37.785 --> 50:39.120
What?

50:42.457 --> 50:45.084
Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

50:45.126 --> 50:47.128
Yeah, yeah, follow me.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.095
Koda?

50:58.598 --> 51:00.308
Koda?

51:02.643 --> 51:04.062
Koda?

51:04.687 --> 51:06.689
Where are you?

51:14.322 --> 51:17.492
- Don't do that.
- Scared you, didn't I?

51:17.533 --> 51:21.037
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.122
And you were both.

51:35.426 --> 51:39.764
Nice try. You got a little spit right there.

51:43.518 --> 51:46.270
- Kenai!
-You're not getting me this time.

51:46.354 --> 51:47.730
No, look out.

51:52.610 --> 51:53.736
No.

51:54.487 --> 51:56.114
Come on.

52:10.586 --> 52:11.671
Kenai.

52:14.924 --> 52:16.717
Kenai, where are you?

52:27.061 --> 52:29.647
Left. Left. No, the other left.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.245
Kenai!

53:06.767 --> 53:08.436
No!

53:13.107 --> 53:15.359
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.389
<i>Why do they hate us, Kenai'?</i>

54:26.472 --> 54:28.599
- We're bears.
-So?

54:28.683 --> 54:31.852
So, you know how they are.
They're killers.

54:31.894 --> 54:34.230
Wait a minute, who's the killers?

54:34.313 --> 54:36.691
- Bears.
-What? Which bears?

54:36.774 --> 54:38.901
I'm not like that, and you're not like that.

54:38.985 --> 54:42.029
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're okay.

54:42.530 --> 54:46.492
Most bears will look for any excuse
to attack a human.

54:46.534 --> 54:49.203
<i>But Kenai, he attacked us.</i>

54:51.664 --> 54:54.208
You're just a cub.
When you're older, you'll understand.

54:54.250 --> 54:57.378
Fish! Fish! Fish!

54:57.461 --> 54:59.380
<i>We made it. We're here.</i>

54:59.463 --> 55:01.757
- Come on!
-What? Koda.

55:01.882 --> 55:05.052
- Fish! Fish! Fish!
-Hey. Get away from me.

55:05.928 --> 55:08.347
Get away from me. Go on.

55:29.952 --> 55:32.913
Hey, you're stirring up the water, dude.

55:32.955 --> 55:35.833
<i>Yeah, but try to save off
the flsh there, buddy.</i>

55:36.751 --> 55:37.793
Tug.

55:37.877 --> 55:40.546
Hey, Koda. Come here.

55:41.130 --> 55:42.590
<i>Look at you.</i>

55:43.257 --> 55:47.261
- Have you seen my mom yet?
-No, as a matter of fact I haven't.

55:48.179 --> 55:51.932
- Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
-He's with you?

55:53.392 --> 55:54.477
Hi.

55:56.228 --> 55:59.023
I've never seen you at the run before.

55:59.106 --> 56:02.902
- Where are you from?
-Well, I...

56:02.943 --> 56:05.863
There's the mountain,
just like I promised.

56:05.946 --> 56:07.990
The lights touch the top every night.

56:08.866 --> 56:11.827
<i>Gonna be harder going up there
than riding those mammoths.</i>

56:11.911 --> 56:13.621
- Mammoths?
-Are you kidding?

56:13.662 --> 56:15.456
- That's weird.
-Yeah.

56:15.498 --> 56:19.126
He does weird stuff.
Like the way he drinks water with a leaf.

56:19.210 --> 56:22.963
He never sharpens his claws on a tree.
He's never hibernated before...

56:23.047 --> 56:24.632
Koda. Koda.

56:25.633 --> 56:28.636
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.

56:30.304 --> 56:32.264
He's kind of jumpy, isn't he?

56:32.306 --> 56:34.141
Okay. Okay.

56:34.642 --> 56:36.310
<i>Koda, I...</i>

56:37.853 --> 56:41.065
- I got to get going.
-Well, when you come back...

56:42.108 --> 56:43.317
I won't be coming back.

56:43.401 --> 56:45.486
What? Why not?

56:46.946 --> 56:49.990
Because... Well, it's hard <i>to...</i>

56:50.032 --> 56:52.284
- You're leaving?
-No.

56:52.326 --> 56:54.120
Well, I mean, yes.

56:54.662 --> 56:57.039
Well, it's just that <i>I...</i>

56:57.123 --> 57:00.501
- I don't belong here.
-Don't belong?

57:00.543 --> 57:04.505
Every bear belongs here.
Come on, buddy.

57:04.547 --> 57:05.756
<i>Everyone's invited</i>

57:05.840 --> 57:07.007
<i>Let's 'nave some mm!</i>

57:07.091 --> 57:09.260

<i>There's</i> a <i>bond between us
nobody can explain</i>

58:04.982 --> 58:08.569
<i>It's a celebration of life</i>

58:08.611 --> 58:11.238
<i>And seeing friends again</i>

58:13.240 --> 58:16.368
<i>I'd be there for you</i>

58:16.410 --> 58:19.705

<i>Remembering love once departed</i>

58:40.935 --> 58:44.605
<i>Someone dear to your heart</i>

58:44.688 --> 58:48.317
<i>Finding love, planning a future</i>

58:48.400 --> 58:52.238
<i>Telling stories

58:52.279 --> 58:55.491
<i>Precious moments you'll never forget</i>

<i>This has to be the most beautiful</i>

58:59.995 --> 59:04.583
<i>The most peaceful piace
I've ever been to</i>

59:05.167 --> 59:10.130
<i>It's nothing like I've ever seen before</i>

59:11.799 --> 59:15.970
<i>When I think how far I've come
I can't believe it</i>

59:16.637 --> 59:18.180
<i>Yet I see it</i>

59:18.847 --> 59:22.643
<i>And then I see family</i>

59:22.726 --> 59:26.772

59:59.972 --> 1:00:03.934
<i>We're here to share it aH</i>

1:00:11.483 --> 1:00:15.696
AII right, settle down, everyone.
Settle down. Hey.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:18.490
Don't throw your fish bones there.
Somebody could choke on that.

1:00:18.532 --> 1:00:20.367
Look, okay, I'll go first.

1:00:20.409 --> 1:00:25.039
Okay, let's see. The most interesting
thing that happened to me this year.

1:00:26.874 --> 1:00:29.126
I know, I know, I know! Listen to this.

1:00:29.209 --> 1:00:31.629
It was when I knocked down that tree

1:00:31.712 --> 1:00:33.922
that was blocking the view
from my cave.

1:00:34.381 --> 1:00:37.509
Now I got a family of chipmunks
staying in my place.

1:00:41.055 --> 1:00:42.139
Yeah.

1:00:42.222 --> 1:00:44.975
All right, everybody,
let me see some paws in the air.

1:00:45.059 --> 1:00:48.103
- Who's gonna be next? Come on.
- Tug. I got one.

1:00:48.187 --> 1:00:51.148
Watch me. Hey, gotcha.

1:00:51.607 --> 1:00:56.111
This year I lost my dear husband Edgar.

1:00:56.195 --> 1:00:58.781
Quit telling everyone I'm dead!

1:00:58.864 --> 1:01:03.535
Sometimes I can still hear his voice.

1:01:03.577 --> 1:01:05.287
I'm getting the next one.

1:01:18.050 --> 1:01:19.968
Oh, yeah.

1:01:22.179 --> 1:01:26.558
- This is it. I got it. I got...
- I guess it's our turn.

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:29.895
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous...

1:01:29.937 --> 1:01:32.064
No, you're gorgeous.

1:01:32.106 --> 1:01:35.776
- You're gorgeous-er.
- Get a cave.

1:01:37.444 --> 1:01:39.446
If only Edgar was alive...

1:01:39.488 --> 1:01:42.116
I told you, woman, I'm right here!

1:01:42.199 --> 1:01:46.245
- I love you, buttercup.
- This has got to be it.

1:01:46.286 --> 1:01:49.790
- Here you go, Koda.
- You gotta tell it, Kenai.

1:01:49.832 --> 1:01:53.001
- What?
- Yes. You caught it, you tell it.

1:01:53.085 --> 1:01:54.962
Didn't you play when you were a cub?

1:01:56.046 --> 1:01:57.381
Come on, Keno.

1:02:00.300 --> 1:02:02.219
Okay, all right already. All right.

1:02:02.886 --> 1:02:05.305
- You want to know what I did this year?
- Yes.

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:10.477
I went on the longest, hardest, most
exhausting journey I've ever been on

1:02:10.561 --> 1:02:13.981
with the biggest pain in the neck
I've ever met.

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:18.318
What do you expect
from a little brother?

1:02:20.529 --> 1:02:22.531
<i>Okay, buddy, your turn.</i>

1:02:23.198 --> 1:02:26.201
- Let's hear it, Koda.
-Okay, okay, here we go.

1:02:27.786 --> 1:02:30.622
This year I watched my mom
in a life-and-death struggle

1:02:30.664 --> 1:02:33.500
battling the most fiercest creature ever.

1:02:33.542 --> 1:02:35.210
- Who's next?
- What?

1:02:35.294 --> 1:02:40.007
Wait a minute. I think we all want
to hear the rest of that one, Koda.

1:02:40.048 --> 1:02:43.719
I thought you might say that. Let's see.

1:02:43.802 --> 1:02:48.348
It was probably the fifth or sixth
most coldest day in my entire life.

1:02:48.432 --> 1:02:51.518
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

1:02:51.602 --> 1:02:56.565
AII of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

1:02:56.940 --> 1:03:00.486
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

1:03:01.528 --> 1:03:04.198
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:06.784
getting closer and closer.

1:03:08.535 --> 1:03:12.539
<i>And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.</i>

1:03:14.416 --> 1:03:17.336
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

1:03:17.377 --> 1:03:21.131
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

1:03:25.552 --> 1:03:29.223
<i>The monster attacks,
but Mom's is quick fior him.</i>

1:03:29.264 --> 1:03:34.853
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

1:03:35.813 --> 1:03:36.814
<i>Kenai.</i>

1:03:36.897 --> 1:03:38.649
Mom smells more of them.

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:40.734
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

1:03:41.235 --> 1:03:43.237
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:45.656
<i>She runs to stop them
before they getto me.</i>

1:03:45.739 --> 1:03:48.784
<i>They're all around her,
poking her with sticks.</i>

1:03:48.867 --> 1:03:52.663
<i>- Sitka.
- The whole thing broke and fell off.</i>

1:03:52.746 --> 1:03:54.581
There was ice everywhere.

1:03:54.665 --> 1:03:57.376
<i>She couldn't hold her breath
any longer, and pow.</i>

1:03:57.417 --> 1:04:01.421
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

1:04:01.713 --> 1:04:04.633
<i>- I'm going after the bear.
- Koda'?</i>

1:04:04.716 --> 1:04:06.593
<i>- Sitka wouldn't want it.
- Sitka's not here</i>

1:04:06.635 --> 1:04:08.720
<i>because of that monster.</i>

1:04:11.181 --> 1:04:14.434
Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

1:04:14.476 --> 1:04:15.644
<i>Can you realize?</i>

1:04:17.271 --> 1:04:19.940
<i>Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?</i>

1:04:20.023 --> 1:04:22.651
- What happened next?
- Was she okay?

1:04:23.777 --> 1:04:27.155
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

1:04:27.239 --> 1:04:30.450
<i>She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.</i>

1:04:30.492 --> 1:04:33.453
<i>After that, I met Kenai.</i>

1:04:33.495 --> 1:04:34.663
Kenai?

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:23.170
Scared you again, huh?

1:05:23.253 --> 1:05:25.130
- Yeah.
- Where have you been?

1:05:25.172 --> 1:05:26.798
- You look horrible.
- Koda...

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:29.843
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:34.264
There's something <i>I...</i>

1:05:35.265 --> 1:05:37.434
You know that story
you told me last night?

1:05:37.517 --> 1:05:40.812
- Yeah.
-Well, I have a story to tell you.

1:05:40.854 --> 1:05:43.190
Really? What's it about?

1:05:43.231 --> 1:05:46.401
Well, it's kind of about a man,

1:05:46.485 --> 1:05:49.071
and kind of about a bear.

1:05:49.154 --> 1:05:52.199
But mostly it's about a monster.

1:05:53.533 --> 1:05:55.494
A monster who did something so bad...

1:05:55.535 --> 1:05:59.915
<i>Everywhere I turn I hurt someone</i>

1:06:01.208 --> 1:06:06.880
<i>But there's nothing I can say
to change the things I've done</i>

1:06:08.048 --> 1:06:11.593
<i>I'd do anything within my power</i>

1:06:11.677 --> 1:06:14.805
<i>I'd give everything I've got</i>

1:06:14.888 --> 1:06:19.476
<i>But the path I seek
is hidden from me now</i>

1:06:19.559 --> 1:06:22.771
Koda, I did something very wrong.

1:06:22.854 --> 1:06:27.025
<i>Brother bear, I let you down</i>

1:06:27.067 --> 1:06:28.777
I don't like this story.

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:33.865
<i>You trusted me, believed in me
and I let you down</i>

1:06:33.907 --> 1:06:35.575
<i>Your mother not coming.</i>

1:06:35.659 --> 1:06:38.996
<i>Of all the things I hide from you</i>

1:06:39.079 --> 1:06:41.832
<i>I cannot hide the shame</i>

1:06:41.915 --> 1:06:43.083
<i>And I pray someone</i>

1:06:43.125 --> 1:06:44.251
No. No!

1:06:44.292 --> 1:06:49.589
<i>Something will come
to take away the pain</i>

1:06:50.298 --> 1:06:53.760
<i>There's no way out</i>

1:06:53.844 --> 1:06:57.097
<i>Of this dark place</i>

1:06:57.180 --> 1:07:00.726
<i>No, no future</i>

1:07:04.104 --> 1:07:09.443
<i>I know I can't be free</i>

1:07:11.653 --> 1:07:15.282
<i>But I can't see another way</i>

1:07:16.783 --> 1:07:21.621
<i>And I can't face another day</i>

1:07:24.374 --> 1:07:27.335
Koda? Koda?

1:07:29.379 --> 1:07:31.131
Koda!

1:07:35.343 --> 1:07:36.970
Koda, I wish I could...

1:07:38.096 --> 1:07:40.807
If there was just some way...

1:07:42.017 --> 1:07:43.560
I'd give anything <i>if...</i>

1:07:46.688 --> 1:07:49.191
If I could just...

1:08:00.994 --> 1:08:03.330
I'm sorry, Koda.

1:08:03.955 --> 1:08:05.665
I'm so sorry.

1:08:42.911 --> 1:08:44.913
I'm sorry, Kenai.

1:08:45.539 --> 1:08:47.707
I don't know what I'm doing any more.

1:08:48.750 --> 1:08:50.752
I need help.

1:09:04.933 --> 1:09:06.434
Sitka.

1:09:17.404 --> 1:09:18.864
Look, I am sorry.

1:09:18.905 --> 1:09:20.907
If I was driving
this neverwould have happened.

1:09:20.991 --> 1:09:26.329
- You never let me do nothing.
- Trample off. I said sorry. Let it go.

1:09:26.413 --> 1:09:28.707
I can't believe you totalled a mammoth.

1:09:28.748 --> 1:09:32.335
- That mountain carne out of nowhere.
- I cannot accept your apology.

1:09:32.419 --> 1:09:36.173
- It was in my blind spot...
- Look. It's that little cub.

1:09:37.215 --> 1:09:40.260
- Something's bugging him.
- What's wrong, smallish bear?

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:42.929
Nothing. I'm fine.

1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:48.393
Good. Where were we? Oh, yeah.
You're a big, selfish, reckless hoofer.

1:09:48.435 --> 1:09:50.520
- What?
- I'm fed up with it.

1:09:50.770 --> 1:09:54.274
<i>- From now on, he's my new brother.
- You can't do that.</i>

1:09:54.357 --> 1:09:57.944
Sorry, you've been replaced
with my dear brother...

1:09:57.986 --> 1:09:59.821
What's your name again?

1:09:59.905 --> 1:10:02.282
I don't want any more brothers.

1:10:02.365 --> 1:10:06.203
- See? He's had enough of you, too.
- I promise I'll change.

1:10:06.286 --> 1:10:10.040
<i>Being a brother means nothing for you.</i>

1:10:10.123 --> 1:10:12.417
- Of course it does.
- Like what?

1:10:12.459 --> 1:10:14.961
What about when your hooves
froze in the pond?

1:10:15.045 --> 1:10:18.548
- Who sat with you all winter, eh?
- You did.

1:10:18.632 --> 1:10:20.800
Who showed you
where the good grazing is?

1:10:20.884 --> 1:10:24.304
The really tender stuff
all covered in dew.

1:10:24.387 --> 1:10:27.057
Now, why do you think I did that, eh?

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:29.100
Because <i>I...</i>

1:10:29.142 --> 1:10:32.062
Because I love...dew.

1:10:32.145 --> 1:10:35.607
Excuse me?
I don't believe I heard what you said.

1:10:35.732 --> 1:10:38.735
I said, "I love dew."

1:10:39.402 --> 1:10:41.738
I love dew, too.

1:10:43.031 --> 1:10:45.492
Hey, I can change.

1:10:45.533 --> 1:10:48.954
- Go away.
-Come on, I can change.

1:10:48.995 --> 1:10:52.749
- Go away, don't touch me.
-I can change.

1:10:52.832 --> 1:10:54.584
Hey. No.

1:10:54.668 --> 1:10:56.711
<i>Not there, that's the spot.</i>

1:10:58.672 --> 1:11:00.465
Like, we'll see you later, smallish bear.

1:11:00.507 --> 1:11:04.427
Yeah, good day.
You know what this calls for?

1:11:04.511 --> 1:11:08.890
A pile of delicious barley and amber
weed on a cool bed of malted hops.

1:11:08.974 --> 1:11:10.976
I like it.

1:11:27.450 --> 1:11:30.036
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:32.831
Sitka?

1:11:34.165 --> 1:11:38.378
Please. Please, Sitka.

1:11:38.420 --> 1:11:40.422
I don't know what else to do.

1:11:44.718 --> 1:11:45.969
Sitka.

1:11:52.892 --> 1:11:54.144
Denahi.

1:11:56.229 --> 1:11:58.231
Sitka, hurry, change me back.

1:12:10.577 --> 1:12:12.579
Where are you, Sitka?

1:12:35.602 --> 1:12:36.770
Denahi.

1:12:38.313 --> 1:12:39.939
Denahi, please.

1:12:44.444 --> 1:12:45.570
Koda.

1:12:56.706 --> 1:12:58.208
No!

1:13:00.293 --> 1:13:01.878
Leave him alone.

1:13:04.964 --> 1:13:06.299
Koda!

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.827
Kenai?

1:13:51.052 --> 1:13:52.595
Sitka?

1:14:16.870 --> 1:14:21.374
Koda, don't be afraid. It's me.

1:15:09.047 --> 1:15:11.090
He needs me.

1:15:12.759 --> 1:15:16.262
You know, he did look better as a bear.

1:15:26.272 --> 1:15:29.484
<i>But, Denahi...</i>

1:15:30.193 --> 1:15:32.070
It's all right, Kenai.

1:15:39.827 --> 1:15:44.207
No matter what you choose,
you'll always be my little brother.

1:16:04.185 --> 1:16:05.520
Did I say little?

1:16:39.596 --> 1:16:41.222
Kenai.

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:12.629
<i>My brother Kenai went on to live
with Koda and the other bears.</i>

1:17:12.712 --> 1:17:16.507
<i>He taught me
that love is very powerful.</i>

1:17:17.592 --> 1:17:21.304
<i>And I passed on the wisdom
of his story to our people.</i>

1:17:22.639 --> 1:17:25.725
<i>The story of a boy who became a man</i>

1:17:26.517 --> 1:17:28.561
<i>by becoming a bear.</i>

1:17:28.978 --> 1:17:32.065
<i>Great spirits of all who lived before</i>

1:17:32.106 --> 1:17:34.901
<i>Take our hands and lead us</i>

1:17:34.942 --> 1:17:40.031
<i>Fill our hearts and souls
with all you know</i>

1:17:40.490 --> 1:17:43.201
<i>Show us that in your eyes</i>

1:17:43.242 --> 1:17:46.037
<i>We are aH the same</i>

1:17:46.079 --> 1:17:51.292
<i>Brothers to each other
in this world we remain</i>

1:17:51.376 --> 1:17:54.337
<i>Truly brothers all the same</i>

1:17:54.420 --> 1:17:59.384
<i>Brothers al! the same</i>

1:18:11.729 --> 1:18:14.565
So, like, what are you doing there,
smallish bear?

1:18:14.607 --> 1:18:17.235
I'm practising my moves.
Want to see one?

1:18:17.276 --> 1:18:19.862
<i>Sure. This ought to be good?</i>

1:18:24.951 --> 1:18:28.996
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:32.500
<i>No beaver. Man into bear. That's all.</i>

1:18:32.583 --> 1:18:36.629
Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

1:18:36.671 --> 1:18:38.965
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.

1:18:39.006 --> 1:18:42.468
<i>Look at my ears and furs feet.
Watch out to the rabbit, eh.</i>

1:18:42.510 --> 1:18:43.803
No way, eh.

1:18:43.845 --> 1:18:47.682
Okay, now, everyone, take a big inhale.

1:18:47.765 --> 1:18:49.225
<i>And then on...</i>

1:18:49.308 --> 1:18:53.521
