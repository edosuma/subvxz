00:01.960 --> 00:05.520
(theme music playing)

01:10.680 --> 01:13.760
(Angela)
<i>Maybe teachers have a hidden life.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:17.560
<i>Where they're actually like human.</i>

01:18.160 --> 01:20.080
<i>Where they have, I don't know...</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:22.160
(grunting)

01:22.240 --> 01:23.280
<i>Dignity.</i>

01:23.360 --> 01:25.520
(screen thuds)

01:25.600 --> 01:27.080
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

01:27.160 --> 01:28.480
(rock music playing)

01:28.560 --> 01:29.520
(woman) Stop it!

01:29.600 --> 01:31.080
Over this way!

01:31.160 --> 01:33.840
(indistinct chatter)

01:39.960 --> 01:41.080
All right!

01:42.440 --> 01:45.920
(door opens and closes)

01:58.440 --> 02:00.200
Oh, sorry. Uh, tooth pick?

02:01.360 --> 02:03.840
Anybody else? Tooth pick?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.680
(Daryl) Wait, wait.
What did he say?

02:05.760 --> 02:07.080
Yo. Speak up, bro.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.400
He said tooth pick.
Right? Isn't that what you said?

02:10.480 --> 02:11.760
(student) Tooth pick.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.240
(laughing)

02:15.400 --> 02:17.200
So, why you here?
You the new substitute?

02:17.280 --> 02:19.720
Why am I here?
Yes, good question.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.680
I'm the new substitute. Yes.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.960
I'm here quite simply to get paid.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.480
(man) Yes, right.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.440
Assuming all of you
can read and write...

02:30.320 --> 02:32.920
I don't perceive
any emergency situation.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.200
That's all.
Continue wasting your lives.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.600
So, um... are we dismissed?

02:47.600 --> 02:49.000
Do you want to be dismissed?

02:49.080 --> 02:53.440
No, you just said
that was all you had to say, so.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.480
No. I will be here for the next
47 minutes.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.760
Whether you will also be here for
that time is, to be candid, your decision.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.280
-What's the catch?
-No catch.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.520
You don't want to be here. Go.
I'm not going to stop you.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.760
Well, you know,
there is just one catch.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.440
We will be discussing you
in your absence.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.840
But, you know,
if you don't mind that.

03:19.920 --> 03:20.920
(students laughing)

03:21.000 --> 03:22.400
-Yes, right.
-(Racine) It's no joke.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.160
I have no lesson planned.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.680
Trashing you in your absence,
will help pass the time.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.320
(students laughing)

03:29.400 --> 03:33.720
Right? You know, it could
possibly be educational as well.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.440
So, what are we suppose to do?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.240
I've known you
all of five minutes...

03:42.320 --> 03:44.400
and you want me to tell you
what you're suppose to do?

03:45.800 --> 03:49.880
Fine, follow your hearts
and veer away from heroin.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.400
No, I meant in the next
47 minutes.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.280
I know what you meant.
That was sarcasm. What?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.560
Um, one of the things we were
suppose to do this semester...

03:59.640 --> 04:04.240
-Krakow! Shh.
-...was, uh, this issue

04:04.320 --> 04:06.400
of the literary magazine.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.400
Uh, like we each wrote something
and but Mayhew,

04:10.480 --> 04:11.880
that's our teacher...

04:11.960 --> 04:14.640
she never approved
the writing or whatever,

04:14.720 --> 04:17.240
because she just quit.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.840
So, we just never did it.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.520
That's a heart breaking tale.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.000
(students laughing)

04:24.720 --> 04:28.000
What I meant was that,
I know where they are.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.240
I mean, the stuff we wrote.
It's in there.

04:30.320 --> 04:34.480
So, could you, just, at least, read it,
so we could get credit for it?

04:38.040 --> 04:38.960
Why not.

04:39.840 --> 04:42.600
Wait, so, let's go over it
one more time.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.160
Look, you don't even have
to be there. This should be me.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.000
Fine.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.960
I'll take him out to dinner and make it
clear that we'll redo the job at cost.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.520
-Fine. Whatever.
-Castro listens to me. He trusts me.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.320
I mean, you know,
not that he...

04:57.400 --> 04:59.880
No, no, no. You're right.
You should handle it.

04:59.960 --> 05:03.640
Anyway, I need you to take Danielle to
the cookie booth and back tomorrow night.

05:04.640 --> 05:05.880
The cookie booth?

05:05.960 --> 05:09.120
It's girl scout cookie time again.
I signed her up.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.840
You sign her up. I end up
at the booth. Yes, well. Fine.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.960
I'll call Neil
and cancel our pool game.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.240
-Oh. You had plans.
-Hmm.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.600
Well, maybe you can call one
of the other moms and...

05:21.680 --> 05:24.160
What, and miss the cookie booth?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.760
Oh. I almost forgot.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.480
One of us has to call
Angela's English teacher,

05:28.560 --> 05:31.160
I think her name is Mayhew
and see if they want us

05:31.240 --> 05:32.680
to print the <i>Lit</i> magazine
again this year.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.200
I reserved the press time.
One of us should call. You should.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.640
You forgot to buy
kitty litter again.

05:39.720 --> 05:43.320
I thought you said you would.
You know what we need?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.280
A wife.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.760
Well...

05:58.840 --> 06:00.200
(clears throat)

06:01.360 --> 06:04.560
I've had the privilege of reading
your entries for the <i>Liberty Lit.</i>

06:05.360 --> 06:09.240
And, how shall I describe them?
Good question.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.160
(sniffs)

06:10.240 --> 06:12.400
Let's see. Boring.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.040
The word boring comes to mind.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.600
Fake. False.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.240
Synthetic.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.400
Bogus.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.040
What do these words
have in common?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.200
You.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.840
-Me?
-Yes, what do these words have in common?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.600
I know what you're going to say.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.360
That they're synonyms meaning
not genuine.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.160
Well, that's true,
that's absolutely true.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.480
But what else are they. I mean,
how else would you classify 'em?

06:48.640 --> 06:51.640
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

06:52.520 --> 06:53.600
You think I'm an idiot?

06:54.640 --> 06:58.240
If I tell you that the
class' work was safe, banal,

06:58.320 --> 07:03.160
homogenized, cutesy, appalling,
all of which is true by the way.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.120
What sort of words am I using?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.560
Tell me.
Don't give me that blank look.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.800
You're not fooling anyone. I'm on to you.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.800
You know this.
You know this.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.840
-Not verbs. Not nouns. But?
-Adjectives.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.800
Adjectives! Whoa. (chuckles)

07:21.400 --> 07:23.800
Don't you dare play dumb
with me again.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.960
Now, as for the rest of you...

07:28.360 --> 07:29.320
Um...

07:30.960 --> 07:33.120
-How shall I phrase this?
-I don't believe this guy.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.920
This is the most God awful crap
I've ever read in my life.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.520
(muttering)

07:44.280 --> 07:47.000
(girl)
Hey, look at that.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.120
(knock on door)

07:49.160 --> 07:50.400
(door opens)

07:50.480 --> 07:52.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.880
You want to buy
some girl scout cookies?

07:53.960 --> 07:56.840
-Um, not really.
-You can owe me the money.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.840
(Graham)
Danielle, leave him alone.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.320
(door closes)

08:05.280 --> 08:08.640
What? You've never seen someone
sew on a merit badge before?

08:09.240 --> 08:12.480
It's not a merit badge.
It's a proficiency badge.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.240
Hi, Brian. Angela. Brian's here.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.120
Well, come one, just one box.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.920
You can freeze them
and eat them later.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
-Danielle.
-Forget it.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.080
(chuckles)

08:24.560 --> 08:26.720
Sorry about that.
What have you got there?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.520
Um, just this thing
Angela wrote that I found.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.400
Her oak tree poem.
I loved that one.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.720
Why does it have this foot
print on it?

08:34.800 --> 08:37.120
Where are the others?
Weren't we going print them up?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.360
Angela didn't tell you?
He threw them out the window.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.360
Who?

08:40.440 --> 08:44.280
This new substitute
who's, like, mentally ill. Seriously.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.160
No, he's not mentally ill.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.400
He threw them out of the window?

08:48.480 --> 08:51.440
-So, do you want this? Or...
-I think that's terrible.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.040
-Mom.
-I'm serious.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.400
You worked very hard on that poem.
You put a lot of thought into it.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.600
It's true. You did.

08:57.680 --> 08:59.720
I don't know.
I don't like it that much.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.440
-Honey, that's not the point.
-Exactly.

09:01.520 --> 09:05.320
I don't care if he is your teacher,
he has to treat you with common courtesy.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.960
Haven't we always taught
you to stand up for your rights?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.800
(clicks tongue)
Thanks, Brian.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.160
(school bell rings)

09:15.640 --> 09:19.480
(students murmuring)

09:19.560 --> 09:20.600
Jordan?

09:21.720 --> 09:22.800
That's your name right.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.840
Look, I appreciate the fact, you
don't want to monopolize the discussion,

09:26.920 --> 09:28.280
but, I mean, come on.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.760
I need you. Do you understand?
I need you to talk more.

09:31.840 --> 09:35.160
-Okay. Just, okay.
-All right.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.320
Jeez.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.520
-By the way, you left this behind.
-I didn't leave that.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.320
Yes, just take it will you?
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.560
(exhales)

09:50.280 --> 09:51.400
What?

09:53.320 --> 09:55.120
-I...
-What? Say it.

09:59.240 --> 10:01.680
I just think what you did
yesterday wasn't right.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.640
I mean,
in terms of common courtesy.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.760
I just think it showed
a lack of respect.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.840
You mean when I threw your work
out of the window.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.880
Yes.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.400
I mean, that oak tree poem?
That was mine.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.720
Oh.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.600
I put a lot of thought into that.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.680
-Did you?
-Yes.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.880
I mean, why did you do it?

10:25.960 --> 10:30.600
Why did I do it? Good question.
I did it to clear the slate.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.840
I did it to wake you up.
I did it to do something.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.360
To find you. And now,
guess what, here you are.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.000
Wide awake. Right in front of me.

10:40.080 --> 10:44.480
I mean, wasn't that worth it?
I mean, that poem.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.880
That oak tree poem. (laughs)

10:50.320 --> 10:51.280
That was yesterday.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.840
What are you going to write today?

10:59.000 --> 10:59.960
Good question.

11:10.280 --> 11:11.840
Rayanne,
you're not in this class.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.480
So. Neither are half these kids.
Come on.

11:14.560 --> 11:16.120
You've been talking
about him for three days.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.800
I got to view this guy.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.200
(bell rings)

11:22.080 --> 11:23.600
-Get out your notebooks.
-(closes door)

11:26.960 --> 11:30.520
Substitute my ass.
He is the real deal.

11:30.600 --> 11:33.320
I want everyone to start over.
From the beginning.

11:33.400 --> 11:36.000
-Start over on what?
-I didn't bring a notebook.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.240
Can't you show a movie?

11:37.320 --> 11:40.000
And, uh, don't give me
anything quaint.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.320
I don't want to see any
domesticated animals

11:42.400 --> 11:44.440
or... or greenery.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.360
I want anger.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.280
I want honesty.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.120
-I want nakedness.
-I'm right here, baby.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.560
-Excuse me. Can I say something?
-Nope.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.040
Write it down.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.560
Whatever you feel like saying
write it down instead.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.080
What you never told anyone.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.680
What you never
even told yourself.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.400
(Rayanne laughs)

12:11.480 --> 12:15.400
And don't fear exposure.
No one is to put his or her name down.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.840
This will be completely anonymous.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.720
Just how I like sex.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.640
What about you?

12:22.160 --> 12:25.760
-Uh... I'm not in this class.
-You're not?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.080
Where are you?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.280
I mean, how can
you say you're not here.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.360
You're here. I see you.
Get out your notebook.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.040
I never wrote anything for the <i>Lit.</i>

12:42.120 --> 12:43.280
(laughs)

12:43.360 --> 12:46.080
Yeah. Well, then you have
an unfair advantage.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.600
-Tell him about the toothpicks.
-Tell him about the socks.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.960
You got to hear about this.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.760
He always wears one white sock
and one black sock.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.400
I've got to see the socks.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.400
(Racine) Well, I, um,
I read all your papers and...

13:04.480 --> 13:07.720
I'm beginning to see signs of life.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.600
Where do we go from here?
Good question.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.160
We go further.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.400
This 102-year-old man
has a son...

13:22.480 --> 13:26.280
(dramatic music playing)

13:33.920 --> 13:36.960
(laughing)

13:45.160 --> 13:47.360
(all laugh)

14:38.840 --> 14:40.640
Okay. We'll start over here.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.400
-Just read it?
-Just read it.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.200
(Sharon)
Um, I can't read this person's writing.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Yes, read it anyway.

14:49.560 --> 14:53.080
"In the fitting room,
price tags tickle my shoulder

14:53.160 --> 14:56.160
as I slip on another dress.
I know this one will fit."

14:56.240 --> 14:58.800
-Angela.
-"This one will make me fly.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.120
(whispers) Angela.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.400
(Racine)
Paint a picture. Just talk.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.360
Don't try and make it sound
like writing. Daryl.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.960
(Daryl) "No one knows
I come out here nights.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.960
I look up,
but you're never there."

15:08.040 --> 15:09.760
-Angela.
-"Only your horrible dog

15:09.840 --> 15:11.520
-who used to bite me..."
-He changed the socks.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.280
(whispers)
Shut up. I'm trying to listen.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.640
"And I realize I'm not angry
at you. Things change."

15:15.720 --> 15:19.840
If you don't know what you're
writing about, no one else will. Yvette.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.800
"When I'm a mother I'll get revenge. I'll
ask questions that miss the entire point."

15:24.880 --> 15:27.280
Forget grammar.
Forget spelling. Forget the rules.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.640
"My father decides
how much cars were worth

15:29.720 --> 15:31.560
before they were totaled,
that's his job."

15:31.640 --> 15:33.920
"I can forgive you,
but I want to kill your dog."

15:34.000 --> 15:37.280
Remember, it isn't just the emotion.
You have to shape the emotion.

15:37.360 --> 15:39.360
"I'll smile when you want to kill me.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.960
I'll throw away your favorite skirt
and never admit it."

15:42.040 --> 15:44.600
"If I drive myself in his car
off a bridge,

15:44.680 --> 15:46.200
what would be the estimated
damages?"

15:46.280 --> 15:48.200
Notice he didn't simply
trash his father,

15:48.280 --> 15:51.000
he found an ingenious way
to trash him.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.680
(all laugh)

15:52.760 --> 15:56.320
Uh, this one has a title.
It's called <i>A Fable.</i>

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
"Once upon a time there lived a girl.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.600
She slept in a lovely little cottage
made of gingerbread and candy.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.720
She was always asleep.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.560
One morning she woke up,
and the candy had mold on it.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.000
Her father blew her a kiss
and the house fell down.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.600
She realized she was lost.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.240
She found herself
walking down a crowded street.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.680
But the people were made
of paper. Like paper dolls.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.760
She blew everyone a kiss goodbye...

16:30.560 --> 16:32.520
and watched as they blew away."

16:33.240 --> 16:35.000
-Huh?
-(laughing)

16:35.080 --> 16:36.720
-Why are you laughing?
-(laughing)

16:36.800 --> 16:38.560
Because it doesn't make any sense.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.400
Yes, that's true. But
it does better then make sense.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.200
It... makes you feel.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.160
It makes you wonder.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.000
It wakes you up.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.760
(laughs)

16:56.080 --> 16:57.880
Okay, has everyone read?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.680
Brian. Read.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.200
-I'm not going to read this.
-Just read.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.600
-Look, I really...
-Read it!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.680
It's called "Haiku for Him".

17:17.240 --> 17:18.880
"He peels off my cloths

17:18.960 --> 17:21.480
like a starving man
would peel an orange."

17:21.560 --> 17:23.760
-(laughing and howling)
-Wow.

17:26.040 --> 17:31.520
-"His lips taste my juicy..."
-(laughing) Juicy.

17:33.280 --> 17:34.720
I refuse to read this.

17:45.400 --> 17:49.440
"His lips taste my juicy sweetness.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.880
My legs tangle with his.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.680
We become...

17:56.480 --> 17:57.520
one being.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.360
A burning furnace...

18:01.200 --> 18:02.680
in the cold cement basement...

18:05.840 --> 18:06.640
of love."

18:09.480 --> 18:10.520
Hormones.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.080
What would we do without them?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.960
Comments. Questions.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.240
Uh, who, uh, who wrote that?

18:19.320 --> 18:21.240
(laughing)

18:21.320 --> 18:22.920
Okay.
Is this a real haiku?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.720
Jordan.

18:27.560 --> 18:33.400
-I don't know.
-Find out. Look up haiku. Now.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.080
Yes, the ever popular Miss Graff.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.120
Just because it's not a real haiku,

18:41.200 --> 18:43.640
that doesn't mean you're not going
to print it in the paper, right?

18:44.400 --> 18:45.760
Because it's real...

18:46.400 --> 18:50.040
I mean,
in the sense that it's true to life.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.360
You're going to print that in the <i>Lit?</i>

18:52.960 --> 18:56.080
-I don't see why not.
-All right, Vic.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.880
(bell rings)

18:57.960 --> 19:00.800
Yeah, come on. Get out of here.
Give me your work back.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.880
Gently. One at a time.
One at a time.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.000
Don't screw them up. Gently.
Give me the work.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.320
Don't drop them on the floor.
Pick them up.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.000
(papers thud)

19:13.080 --> 19:16.480
That was mine.
Not the haiku thing.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.520
Yes, I know which one was yours.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.600
Jordan. Come here.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.280
I'm not finished with you yet.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.560
What's that word?

19:31.560 --> 19:34.600
Don't look at the window.
What's the word?

19:35.480 --> 19:36.960
-(exhales)
-Uh...

19:37.800 --> 19:38.880
What's the sound?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.280
Okay.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.000
Finish the chapter
and the next ten poems tonight.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.360
What? Are you crazy?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.840
Yeah, good question.
Look, this is haiku poetry.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.800
Haiku poetry contains only
17 syllables per poem.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.520
That ain't a lot syllables.
Don't skip any. Get out of my sight.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.720
My daughter, ahem,
is in your class.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.000
I mean, in the class
that you're substituting for.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.920
My wife and I,
we run a small printing shop.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.040
Well, actually she runs it.

20:14.120 --> 20:18.560
Uh... anyway, I've come by
for the submissions for the <i>Lit.</i>

20:19.160 --> 20:23.040
Angela, forgot to mention that they have
to be at the shop by the morning. Or...

20:23.120 --> 20:24.520
(rumbles table)

20:25.120 --> 20:28.920
You know that kid that just left
here? That extremely smart kid.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.400
It seems nobody
ever bothered to notice

20:31.480 --> 20:33.400
that he never quite
learned how to read.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.880
I mean, it pisses me off.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.000
Toothpick?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.400
Okay. We have to figure out
which one is Angela's.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.080
So, what is this
substitute person like?

20:51.160 --> 20:53.160
Is Brian Krakow right?
Is he mentally ill?

20:53.240 --> 20:54.240
Possibly.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.600
I mean, he didn't give me any Kool-Aid
to drink, or anything like that.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.760
No, actually, he's a pretty cool guy.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.360
Cool?
Cool is not what substitutes are.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.520
Substitutes have hard to pronounce
last names and bad haircuts.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.920
-Well, this substitute is cool.
-He's not a substitute.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
-Maybe he's a narc.
-Maybe you're a narc.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.600
You know what we need?
A sample of her handwriting.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.720
-Who are we? The KGB?
-God, these are weird.

21:20.800 --> 21:23.080
I don't know what was wrong
with the one about the oak tree.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.200
You don't think she wrote
the one where they kill the dog.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.600
(chuckles)

21:27.680 --> 21:31.040
-Mayday.
-Is that Angela's? Let me see.

21:32.320 --> 21:36.240
-Oh, my God.
-My juicy sweetness?

21:36.320 --> 21:38.080
It's the end of the world.

21:40.120 --> 21:42.720
No. No way.
I'm not going to print that.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.360
What happened
to freedom of expression?

21:44.440 --> 21:45.960
-Screw it.
-(laughs)

21:46.040 --> 21:48.080
I'll call this substitute
person and explain.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.280
I mean, come on.
That doesn't belong in the <i>Lit.</i>

21:51.360 --> 21:53.720
In the cold cement basement of love.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.680
(chuckles)

21:58.600 --> 22:00.480
-You don't think.
-No.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.720
We don't even have a basement.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.720
-Let me see that again.
-Hey.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.080
Get your own.

22:15.760 --> 22:21.360
Mr. Racine? We spoke earlier.
I'm Angela's mother.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.040
-Yes, yes. Hi.
-Hi.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.120
-I met your husband the other day.
-Right.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.840
Um, what I wanted
to talk about was...

22:30.920 --> 22:32.080
He's a lucky man.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.960
Oh. (laughs)

22:35.040 --> 22:36.200
Thank you.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.800
My husband and I read
the stuff that the kids wrote.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.480
I hope it didn't give him a heart attack.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.720
Well?

22:44.360 --> 22:46.560
You know, he seems a little fragile.

22:47.680 --> 22:50.680
Actually, it isn't my husband
who had the problem.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.200
Really.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.360
I just think that...

22:56.000 --> 22:56.920
(chuckles)

22:57.000 --> 22:59.600
There's this one piece in particular...

23:00.200 --> 23:04.120
that I just don't feel
comfortable printing.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.600
Oh, uh, you are... you are
afraid that Angela wrote it.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.000
(scoffs)

23:10.080 --> 23:13.520
This has nothing to do
with whether Angela wrote it.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.880
So, this is just censorship
for censorship sake.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.920
-What?
-Okay. Hand them over.

23:19.000 --> 23:23.520
No, I'll type them myself
and I'll have them Xeroxed.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.560
These are children. We are adults.
This is not censorship.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.680
This is guiding adolescents
who need...

23:32.760 --> 23:34.160
guidance.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.240
That was a very reasonable opinion.
And very clearly stated.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.280
Unfortunately, it is total manure.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.760
Excuse me?

23:41.840 --> 23:44.520
Its horse manure. I sense
you're angry. Are you angry?

23:44.600 --> 23:46.440
-Yes.
-Yes, I sensed that.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.000
-Why is it manure?
-Good question. It is manure

23:50.080 --> 23:52.680
because this should be
about giving students a voice.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.880
It's not about
having their thoughts edited.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.120
(exhales)

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
If these kids aren't afraid to
put their hearts on the page,

23:58.280 --> 23:59.760
why should we be afraid of them?

24:02.720 --> 24:04.680
You should really teach full time.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.320
We have a difference of opinion.
Fine.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.160
Do you think you should decide

24:11.240 --> 24:13.400
because you have a printing press
and I don't?

24:14.680 --> 24:17.400
-You expect me to answer that?
-Yes.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.320
(sighs)

24:21.280 --> 24:23.800
No. I don't.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Neither do I.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.160
So...

24:35.120 --> 24:36.640
did Angela write it?

24:58.520 --> 25:03.120
(theme music playing)

25:08.520 --> 25:11.040
(bell rings)

25:11.120 --> 25:13.560
(dramatic music playing)

26:07.680 --> 26:08.760
(door closes)

26:09.760 --> 26:10.960
(Mr. Foster) Shawna!

26:15.080 --> 26:16.160
(door opens)

26:17.720 --> 26:19.800
I want to see Mr. Racine
after the final bell.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.440
Yes, Mr. Foster.

26:22.720 --> 26:23.560
(door closes)

26:23.640 --> 26:26.800
First of all, whoever wrote it
has zero self respect.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.200
I know, I mean,
to do it in your basement.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.720
I know, my basement is so filthy.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.760
Plus, she has no self esteem
or she'd sign her name.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.960
Look. He said not to sign it,
okay?

26:38.040 --> 26:40.600
He said it should be anonymous,
okay?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.200
It was a rule he made in class,
okay?

26:43.800 --> 26:46.120
Excuse me.
Try your own conversation.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.520
Plus a muscle relaxer.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.200
(door opens)

26:52.280 --> 26:53.560
You?

26:55.920 --> 26:56.920
So?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.320
You wrote that haiku poem?

27:02.000 --> 27:02.920
You?

27:03.000 --> 27:05.360
Yes. Will you shut up about it?

27:05.960 --> 27:07.520
You wrote it?

27:07.600 --> 27:09.840
And you don't want people
to know that you wrote it?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.160
No. I can't wait for people
to find out.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.960
I'm looking forward to it.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.280
Why are you even talking to me?

27:16.360 --> 27:18.480
We have nothing to say
to each other.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.360
Oh, God. Do you know
how over my life will be

27:23.440 --> 27:25.880
when people find out I wrote it?

27:25.960 --> 27:29.760
Do you know how over mines going to be
when they find out that I didn't?

27:31.600 --> 27:32.480
Really?

27:34.000 --> 27:37.760
You mean...
people think you wrote it?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.680
Well, yes,
I kind of gave off that impression.

27:42.400 --> 27:46.200
So why can't we just
let them keep thinking that.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.400
-We could.
-Is this a trick or something?

27:49.480 --> 27:52.400
No, it's not a trick.
I want people to think I wrote it.

27:52.480 --> 27:54.440
I wish I had wrote it... written it.

27:55.360 --> 27:58.400
I mean, how did you write something...

27:59.840 --> 28:00.760
that good?

28:01.920 --> 28:02.840
I don't know.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.720
It just... kind of came to me.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.160
My favorite part...

28:09.920 --> 28:12.760
is when they become the furnace.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.440
-(door opens and closes)
-Rayanne, you would not...

28:17.320 --> 28:19.040
-Hi.
-Hi.

28:19.120 --> 28:20.240
Hey.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.720
Oh, my God.
You will not believe this.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.320
Actually you should hear this, too.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.600
-Spit it out.
-Foster has the <i>Lit.</i>

28:29.280 --> 28:30.360
Has it, like, every copy

28:30.440 --> 28:32.200
except a few that people stole
or something.

28:32.280 --> 28:34.880
He's refusing to allow us
to distribute it.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.480
Because of your haiku thing.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.760
Really?

28:42.320 --> 28:44.120
So Vic says
we have several options.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.600
We could file a lawsuit,

28:45.680 --> 28:48.320
sue the school for denying us
our constitutional rights.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.800
Or we could stage a walk out.

28:50.880 --> 28:55.600
You would not believe how many boxes
of thin mints Mrs. Casteo bought. Nine.

28:55.680 --> 28:58.160
Vic had the most amazing idea.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.120
We could stage a make believe
book burning.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.560
Because, you know,
Nazi's burned books.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.400
So, is that what Foster's saying?

29:05.480 --> 29:08.440
That a school should burn books
like Nazi's?

29:09.040 --> 29:12.560
Except that Mr. Foster hasn't
actually burned anything. Has he?

29:13.840 --> 29:15.640
Has he burned anything?

29:17.160 --> 29:18.480
Good question.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.680
No, but it amounts to the same thing.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.960
Vic says that if somebody called
a news station and read them our poem,

29:26.040 --> 29:27.840
we'd have camera crews,
instantaneously,

29:27.920 --> 29:29.480
all over the school.

29:30.080 --> 29:32.560
-Is there anymore brisket?
-You call your teacher Vic?

29:32.640 --> 29:36.040
-You call him Vic?
-It's his name. And I...

29:36.120 --> 29:39.840
I know I've been talking
a lot about him, but he's...

29:41.360 --> 29:45.240
I just respect him, you know.
He's smart.

29:45.320 --> 29:50.960
He's like... he's an adult
I can look up to. Finally.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.680
(dog barking outside)

29:53.760 --> 29:55.480
-What?
-(together) Nothing.

29:56.880 --> 30:00.960
Look, sweetie, don't get
carried away with this. Okay?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.560
I'm going to count my money again.

30:03.640 --> 30:06.680
I mean, I know how easy it is
to get caught up in these things.

30:06.760 --> 30:09.760
-It's exciting.
-Exciting? It's not exciting.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.720
It's important.
It's an important issue.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.880
What? You think I'm doing
this for excitement? For fun?

30:14.960 --> 30:17.600
-Angela.
-The point is, we are concerned.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.600
We can't help it. We're
concerned about your future.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.920
We don't want you doing anything
that could get you into trouble.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.920
I can't believe this.
What about all those boring stories

30:26.000 --> 30:29.440
I've had to sit through my whole life
about how committed you were in the '60s?

30:29.520 --> 30:30.960
About how you believed in things.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.760
-We did.
-Oh, right.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.920
Only now you're so terrified
of causing trouble,

30:35.000 --> 30:36.920
you can't even see
what it means to me.

30:40.040 --> 30:42.240
(footsteps)

30:42.320 --> 30:44.040
(exhales)

30:44.120 --> 30:45.440
(chuckles)

30:46.640 --> 30:47.800
It's simple.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.640
I say we go to Foster
and we tell him we want it.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.840
Technically...
it's our property.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.160
It's our class work.
He has to give it to us.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.160
So, what did you hear?
Where is he?

30:57.240 --> 30:59.360
People are saying everything.
That he was fired.

30:59.440 --> 31:02.480
That he was sleeping with a junior.
That he was thrown in jail.

31:02.560 --> 31:03.880
-Which junior?
-(bell rings)

31:03.960 --> 31:05.640
Will everyone please take their seats.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.520
(door closes)

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
Well, some of you know
I've read the <i>Liberty Lit</i>

31:16.480 --> 31:18.600
and found certain materials
in it unacceptable.

31:18.680 --> 31:22.200
Those of you who have copies
will please bring it to administration.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.400
Excuse me.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.600
Yes, the young lady right there.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.960
How can you say it's unacceptable
if nobody is allowed to see it?

31:28.040 --> 31:30.360
-Yes, what's wrong with it?
-Can I just say something?

31:30.440 --> 31:32.320
All right. That's enough.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.000
I must hold school
authorized publications

31:35.080 --> 31:36.800
to certain standards of decency.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.600
Anyone found distributing the journal

31:39.680 --> 31:42.600
will be suspended from school.
That's a promise.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.640
A new substitute will be here
in a minute...

31:44.720 --> 31:47.000
to work with you until we find
a permanent replacement.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.280
Is that clear?

31:48.360 --> 31:50.200
Hey, it's him. It's Mr. Racine.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.120
(Foster) People that's enough.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.080
(Rayanne) Mr. Racine.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.800
Please remain in your seats.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.040
-Mr. Racine.
-Mr. Racine!

32:01.120 --> 32:04.520
-Come on back! Don't leave us.
-Vic, where are going.

32:04.600 --> 32:06.880
-Mr. Racine.
-(Angela) Vic.

32:06.960 --> 32:09.080
Mr. Racine.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.080
There is nothing to see.

32:11.160 --> 32:12.360
(indistinct chatter)

32:12.440 --> 32:14.200
Kindly take your seats.

32:18.640 --> 32:22.400
All that crap about honesty and truth.
And he didn't even teach.

32:22.480 --> 32:24.640
-He did teach.
-What?

32:24.720 --> 32:27.000
He was the best teacher
I ever had.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.360
Well, he was.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.640
Hey, Vic.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.320
(footsteps approaching)

33:05.400 --> 33:07.520
We're upset, you know,
about what's been happening.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.920
Vic, is it true? Are you fired?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.400
Yes, you could say that.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.040
I can't believe this.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.880
I can't believe you were fired
because of one poem.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.520
Why? You think injustice
like that doesn't happen?

33:21.600 --> 33:24.160
It happens every day. Wake up.

33:39.400 --> 33:41.880
(bell rings)

33:43.240 --> 33:44.320
(door closes)

33:54.080 --> 33:56.160
Thank you for taking the
time to...

33:56.240 --> 34:00.840
Uh, for taking the time.
Anyway, I'll make this brief.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.800
Let me see.
You're daughter is...

34:02.880 --> 34:06.560
Angela. Angela Chase.
She's a sophomore.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.360
She had a substitute teacher
in English the past two weeks...

34:10.440 --> 34:14.680
who I met, actually, and
who actually seems kind of...

34:14.760 --> 34:17.440
Mr. Chase, there is no reason
to go any further.

34:17.520 --> 34:19.160
Mr. Racine is out,

34:19.240 --> 34:24.800
and will no longer be substitute teaching
at Liberty in the foreseeable future.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.160
Look. I don't want to make trouble.

34:33.240 --> 34:37.480
But my daughter,
he got her thinking, you know?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.920
And questioning.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.920
Which is, I mean... isn't that what all
of this is suppose to be about?

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
-Mr. Chase...
-She was really shaken up.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.440
She believes you fired him.

34:50.160 --> 34:53.240
Well, that's fascinating.
Because I didn't.

34:53.320 --> 34:56.000
-You didn't fire him?
-Never had that particular pleasure. No.

34:56.080 --> 35:00.320
I was strongly considering it,
mind you, and then he quit.

35:01.320 --> 35:05.440
Right after I showed him this.
It's a copy of a subpoena,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.680
addressed to a Mr. Theodore
Victor a.k.a. Victor Racine,

35:08.760 --> 35:10.120
stating that the aforementioned

35:10.200 --> 35:12.840
Mr. Racine must appear
in a New Hampshire court

35:12.920 --> 35:16.320
within 60 days for failure
to pay child support

35:16.400 --> 35:21.400
to a family he deserted months ago...
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.760
He took one look at that
and walked out that door.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.800
He deserted his family.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.800
So, that's the story
of Mr. Victor Racine.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.280
Whatever his name is.
God, I wish I didn't know.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.400
I wish he hadn't told me.

35:43.040 --> 35:43.920
Now, what do I do?

35:46.160 --> 35:48.960
You tell her the truth.
She can handle it.

35:49.040 --> 35:51.400
Hmm. Mmm.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.000
I remembered to buy kitty litter.

35:54.560 --> 35:55.640
My hero.

35:58.960 --> 36:05.240
(Angela)<i> It's so weird that</i>
<i>teachers actually live places.</i>

36:08.720 --> 36:10.640
I looked you up in the phone book.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.720
I couldn't believe
you were just right there.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.080
I'm sorry if that's not
the right thing to do.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.040
Well, what a waste of a Saturday.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.080
Uh...

36:22.960 --> 36:26.880
I heard you left your family.
Abandoned them.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
I see.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.520
Are you saying you didn't?
What's the truth?

36:34.600 --> 36:36.600
Well, there are a couple of truths.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.000
One truth is I left my family.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.640
The other truth is my wife...

36:48.120 --> 36:49.440
is far better off without me.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.160
(laughs)

36:52.240 --> 36:54.160
Yes, I got out. I escaped.

36:55.680 --> 36:57.200
I broke out of a prison...
of my own making,

36:57.280 --> 37:00.320
and many, many people
want to punish me for that.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.120
Maybe, including you.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.560
I don't want to punish anyone.
I'm just... I'm trying to...

37:07.640 --> 37:13.440
To what? To understand? Look.
My struggle for freedom is mine.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.400
Get your own. Get out
before it's too late, Amanda.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.360
Get out? Get out of what?

37:21.440 --> 37:25.040
That mind control factory.
That warehouse they store you in.

37:25.120 --> 37:28.000
Because they don't know
what else to do with you.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.560
You're telling me to drop
out of high school?

37:30.640 --> 37:34.760
Good question.
Yes. Run for your life.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.640
Save your life.

37:37.960 --> 37:43.800
Let the walls of your ginger bread
house come crashing down.

37:45.000 --> 37:46.680
(birds chirping)

37:46.760 --> 37:47.960
Or not.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.760
It's Angela.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.280
And I have to say...

37:58.720 --> 38:01.600
I don't think leaving
high school is the answer.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.480
I don't think leaving anything is.

38:10.840 --> 38:12.160
The thing is...

38:14.240 --> 38:16.800
Is I kind of admired you.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.720
Come on.
Uh, I'll drive you home.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.640
-What?
-Nothing.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.720
Is there anyone's car
you won't get into?

38:54.800 --> 38:57.640
Right. I live my life to annoy you,
Krakow. You're like my world.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.280
Shut up. I mean, he's old.
He's a teacher.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.320
What? You think I did
something with him? (laughs)

39:03.400 --> 39:06.600
-I don't know. How do I know?
-Are you demented?

39:06.680 --> 39:08.600
Do you just view everything
in terms of sex?

39:08.680 --> 39:09.880
Not everything.

39:11.240 --> 39:13.440
I had things to say to him.
We talked.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.240
-He drove me home. God.
-Okay.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.720
I have a right not to like him.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.880
That's true. You do.

39:31.160 --> 39:35.360
(door opens and closes)

39:38.800 --> 39:39.760
Are you okay?

39:41.680 --> 39:42.560
Pretty much.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.360
(clears throat)

39:55.560 --> 39:57.800
You know what this really
boils down to, sweetheart?

39:59.360 --> 40:03.480
Every fight is not worth fighting.
You're learning that...

40:03.560 --> 40:07.880
Exactly. It's just... part of growing up.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.280
And sometimes you have to compromise.

40:11.360 --> 40:14.600
Well... no one should have
to compromise their principles,

40:14.680 --> 40:18.360
but if you never learned
to compromise at all, then...

40:18.440 --> 40:21.360
Exactly.
Because compromise is...

40:22.720 --> 40:24.040
We all have to compromise.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.600
It's part of life.
It's a part of marriage.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.480
You're mother and I compromise
all the time.

40:30.560 --> 40:34.000
Exactly. And you can't win every fight.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.200
You just have to pick your battles.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.200
I know. You're right.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.720
And the oak tree looks down on us still.

40:47.720 --> 40:54.400
Beautiful. Concise. Excellent grammar.
Impeccable punctuation.

40:55.080 --> 40:59.200
It is a little difficult to read, of
course, with this foot print.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.800
It should probably be retyped.

41:03.880 --> 41:05.520
Still notice how the author...

41:05.600 --> 41:09.280
I had her as a substitute once.
Vic was cool.

41:10.360 --> 41:11.240
Yes, he was.

41:11.320 --> 41:15.200
All in all, an excellent example
of creative writing.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.800
Which one of you is Angela Chase?

41:21.480 --> 41:22.560
Angela Chase?

41:25.920 --> 41:28.800
(copier machine running)

41:39.920 --> 41:42.520
Want a copy of the <i>Liberty Lit?</i>
It's free.

41:43.240 --> 41:48.400
<i>Liberty Lit?</i> Want a copy?
The <i>Liberty Lit</i>? It's free.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.280
What?

41:50.880 --> 41:52.400
Nothing.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.800
I could take some of those
and hand them out upstairs.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.200
Why?

41:59.320 --> 42:02.160
Because... I think you're right.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.720
(bell rings)

42:04.800 --> 42:08.000
I mean, I also think Vic
is a complete degenerate, but...

42:08.440 --> 42:11.440
-This is freedom of speech.
-You could get suspended.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.480
So.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.000
Miss Chase.
May I speak with you?

42:14.080 --> 42:16.320
Want a copy of the <i>Liberty Lit</i>
Mr. Demitri?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.520
Maybe later.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.640
Right now Mr. Foster would
like to see you in his office.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.600
Okay.

42:20.680 --> 42:22.640
She's passing out something
that our English class wrote.

42:22.720 --> 42:24.120
Since when is that a crime?

42:24.200 --> 42:25.400
Would you like to join her,
Brian?

42:25.480 --> 42:26.760
I can go by myself.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.200
Where are you suppose to be?

42:36.480 --> 42:37.440
Computer.

42:39.440 --> 42:41.200
(Patty) Here we are?

42:42.440 --> 42:45.960
-Oh, no. They called you?
-Of course, they called us.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.400
I can see that you really took what
we talked about the other day to heart.

42:51.480 --> 42:52.800
I did.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.800
Do you know what this means?
This will go on your record.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.600
I want it to go on my record.

42:57.680 --> 43:00.040
-You want it to?
-Okay. Let's just stay calm.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.520
We're in the principal's office here.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.680
I mean, what is the point of school
if you can't say what you're thinking?

43:04.760 --> 43:08.040
Do you have to be the personal
spokesperson for the entire school?

43:08.120 --> 43:11.880
You told me to pick my battles.
Well, this is it.

43:12.480 --> 43:15.600
And it may not be a war protest

43:15.680 --> 43:18.840
or a civil rights demonstration
but it's all I've got.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.560
That's not completely true.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.680
There are a couple of truths.

43:26.760 --> 43:29.000
You said I needed
to decide what to fight for.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.120
I decided.

43:32.320 --> 43:35.800
I just think it's wrong to censor people
and I'm willing to get suspended for it.

43:40.520 --> 43:43.360
(Foster) Mr. And Mrs. Chase.
Angela.

43:46.960 --> 43:50.720
Listen. Racine. What he did.
Walking out on his family.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.280
You know that can never happen
in our family.

43:55.320 --> 43:56.720
You know that, don't you?

43:56.800 --> 44:00.640
Graham. Of course, she knows it.
Come on.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.000
Oh, God, I hate being called
to the principle.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.120
Angela, I believe I made it
clear to you and your classmates

44:14.200 --> 44:17.960
that anyone caught distributing this
issue of the <i>Lit</i> would be suspended.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.560
-Do you remember hearing that?
-Yes.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.840
And yet not only did you distribute it,

44:22.920 --> 44:27.000
you reproduced it using school equipment
and supplies. Isn't that right?

44:27.080 --> 44:28.360
Yes.

44:28.440 --> 44:30.520
And while you were suppose
to be in English class.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.200
And I also cut Bio yesterday.

44:34.480 --> 44:37.880
Well... is there anything you'd
like to say in your own defense?

44:37.960 --> 44:40.440
-No.
-Because I'm willing to listen.

44:40.520 --> 44:43.240
-If I may interject...
-Mom!

44:45.200 --> 44:47.360
There's nothing else
I want to say.

44:47.960 --> 44:48.880
I see.

44:50.680 --> 44:51.960
Well...

45:02.480 --> 45:04.040
I'm not going to suspend you.

45:05.200 --> 45:10.480
I think Mr. Racine gave you kids very
distorted ideas about right and wrong.

45:10.560 --> 45:13.720
Angela, this obviously isn't you.

45:13.800 --> 45:18.320
I'm willing to forget about
this one isolated incident.

45:19.840 --> 45:20.960
It's over.

45:31.920 --> 45:34.280
(Angela)
<i>Once upon a time there lived a girl.</i>

45:35.760 --> 45:39.520
<i>She slept In a lovely cottage</i>
<i>made of gingerbread and candy.</i>

45:41.840 --> 45:43.560
<i>She was always asleep.</i>

45:45.680 --> 45:47.440
<i>One morning she woke up.</i>

45:47.520 --> 45:50.600
(bell rings)

45:54.840 --> 45:56.160
<i>She woke up.</i>

45:57.280 --> 45:59.440
(indistinct chatter)

46:10.000 --> 46:12.560
(theme music playing)

46:49.360 --> 46:53.520
