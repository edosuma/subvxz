-Trevor, no one here

00:05.080 --> 00:06.246
needs to know that
we're related,

00:06.340 --> 00:07.822
-that you're my biological son.
-I need to talk

00:07.842 --> 00:09.324
to the state medical board.
Dr. Bell

00:09.418 --> 00:10.400
asked me to write him
a recommendation for it.

00:10.402 --> 00:11.993
He told me Robert Porter...

00:12.013 --> 00:13.737
is angling for a seat
on the board.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.088
He has to be stopped.

00:15.241 --> 00:17.474
He raped me
when I was 13 years old.

00:19.002 --> 00:20.001
Withdraw the complaint.

00:20.095 --> 00:21.428
Say you lied for Dr. Bell,

00:21.580 --> 00:22.579
and you'll never hear
from me again.

00:22.598 --> 00:23.597
You're scared.

00:23.766 --> 00:24.523
Withdraw it

00:24.750 --> 00:25.840
or I will destroy you.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.584
I'm fully aware
of your mistakes.

00:27.603 --> 00:29.177
I'll expose all of them,

00:29.196 --> 00:31.846
and I will take away the

Okay, Uncle Ishman

02:01.864 --> 02:04.289

-It's kind of an emergency.

02:06.776 --> 02:08.018

02:08.111 --> 02:10.796

-You haven't seen?

02:28.798 --> 02:30.040
It's all over Twitter.

02:30.058 --> 02:31.466
Apparently,
Dr. Sutton cut unsupervised

02:31.635 --> 02:32.634
when she was a resident.

02:32.728 --> 02:34.570
Ended up paralyzing a patient.

02:53.899 --> 02:56.175
(phone chiming)

03:21.702 --> 03:26.947
Why are we concerning ourselves
with a few inflammatory tweets?

03:27.099 --> 03:28.856
If by "a few" you mean hundreds.

03:28.951 --> 03:30.934
Are they wrong?

03:31.027 --> 03:33.069
Did you not promote Dr. Sutton
knowing full well

03:33.121 --> 03:34.862
she had been fired
for misconduct?

03:34.957 --> 03:36.122
All doctors make mistakes.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.033
Billie was promoted
because she deserved it.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.277
Did she deserve it
over our surgeons

03:40.295 --> 03:42.112
with more experience
and seniority?

03:42.130 --> 03:44.948
What you should be asking
yourself is why these reports

03:45.041 --> 03:46.725
are surfacing now, years later.

03:46.952 --> 03:48.134
Dr. Voss is right.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.379
There clearly is
an ulterior motive here.

03:51.398 --> 03:55.717
Dr. Sutton filed a complaint
against a powerful doctor.

03:55.794 --> 03:58.478
If I were to guess,
this is a smear campaign

03:58.630 --> 04:01.147
designed to turn
the public against her.

04:02.317 --> 04:04.225
Keeping Chastain under
this intense public scrutiny

04:04.245 --> 04:06.136
is not something
we can risk right now.

04:06.305 --> 04:08.247
Then what do you suggest?

04:08.398 --> 04:11.324
You know how much this board
respects you, Dr. Voss.

04:11.401 --> 04:13.643
But I think you should be
relieved of your CEO duties.

04:13.662 --> 04:16.313
Just until we get
this situation handled.

04:16.331 --> 04:19.332
-You want to fire me?
-No one's being fired.

04:19.485 --> 04:22.002
We can mute the outrage
by putting someone in your seat

04:22.154 --> 04:23.428
that can take the heat
off the hospital.

04:23.655 --> 04:27.991
Even if we were considering
this, which we are not,

04:28.010 --> 04:30.176
who would that person be?

04:30.329 --> 04:32.938
Dr. Bell
is the obvious candidate.

04:33.089 --> 04:35.348
I think we should take a vote.

04:35.501 --> 04:37.091
All in favor

04:37.111 --> 04:41.029
of putting Dr. Voss
on a temporary leave of absence.

-And allowing toxins

11:15.901 --> 11:17.550
there's usually fire.

11:18.904 --> 11:20.387
(scoffs)

11:24.000 --> 11:25.258
Hey, Hawkins.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.018
Do you know what's up
with this Sutton thing?

11:27.211 --> 11:28.502
-I assume it's getting worse.
-By the minute.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.097
I know she's your friend.
Is there anything I can do?

11:31.249 --> 11:33.525
Shut down any rumors
you hear around this place.

11:33.676 --> 11:35.527
The gossip mill
is amplifying everything.

11:35.754 --> 11:37.770
Yeah, that intern Trevor
was pretty upset.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.089
Trevor?

11:40.183 --> 11:41.925
-Why?
-I don't know.

11:41.943 --> 11:45.036
But he was defending
the hell out of her.

11:52.546 --> 11:55.271
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:55.364 --> 11:57.716
You know I care about you,
right?

11:57.867 --> 11:59.609
What is going on here?

11:59.611 --> 12:02.612
Hmm, I wish I could
tell you, Conrad.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.005
You can.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.466
Uh, you won't understand.

12:07.227 --> 12:11.454
Actually, the only person
who ever did

12:11.473 --> 12:13.148
was Nic.

12:14.142 --> 12:17.152
Times like this,
I really miss her.

12:18.554 --> 12:22.282
Nic wouldn't want you
to carry this weight alone.

12:22.984 --> 12:24.743
Talk to me.

12:33.828 --> 12:35.236
I filed an ethics complaint

12:35.404 --> 12:37.071
against a doctor
who's up for a seat

12:37.165 --> 12:39.816
on the state medical board.

12:39.834 --> 12:42.427
And now he's trying
to destroy you?

12:48.251 --> 12:51.186
What kind of ethics complaint?

12:52.922 --> 12:55.774
Uh, it was a...

12:56.001 --> 12:58.526
"Me Too" kind of a thing.

12:59.595 --> 13:02.071
I am so sorry.

13:02.932 --> 13:05.099
When did this happen?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.118
A long time ago.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.121
-Too long ago.
-Doesn't matter.

13:10.273 --> 13:12.273
We will fight back. Go public.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.418
-Out him for the monster he is.
-I can't.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.254
Why not?

13:19.466 --> 13:21.090
It's complicated.

13:23.452 --> 13:25.786
Please just keep this
between us.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.307
-Promise me.
-Of course.

13:30.869 --> 13:34.312
But if you're going into battle,
I want to be your wingman.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.998
So, our window washer, who took
an unexpected bungee jump,

13:54.150 --> 13:57.243
she has a spinal compression
and a pelvic fracture.

13:57.395 --> 13:59.170
The spinal compression
appears minor.

13:59.322 --> 14:01.397
No reason to believe
it wouldn't heal on its own,

14:01.416 --> 14:05.159
but that pelvic fracture,
that's a different story.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.595
Marshall told me what happened
with the board.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.683
We are all standing
by you and Billie.

14:11.910 --> 14:13.426
AUSTIN:
What he said.

14:13.578 --> 14:17.747
We got your back, Boss Voss.
Just let us know what you need.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.266
This.

14:20.418 --> 14:23.086
Tara needs an open reduction
internal fixation

14:23.104 --> 14:24.770
on her pelvis immediately.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.923
It will be a brutal operation.

14:26.941 --> 14:29.701
Incredibly long.

14:29.928 --> 14:32.186
And I can't wait.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.948
This is the best medicine
for Tara and me today.

14:36.101 --> 14:37.959
I'll take it from here,
gentlemen.

14:39.662 --> 14:41.254
Well, all right.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.368
-Is it true?
-Depends. Which part?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.462
Are you really a card-carrying
member of the Illuminati?

14:49.614 --> 14:51.280
That's ridiculous.
We don't carry cards anymore.

14:51.299 --> 14:53.540
I've had Internet mobs
come after me.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.042
It can happen to anyone.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.469
Oh, yeah? What did you do?

14:56.621 --> 14:58.879
Uh, something to do with
Christmas being a pagan holiday.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.289
You know, nothing to do
with baby Jesus.

15:00.308 --> 15:01.974
I didn't realize
I'd be unleashing Armageddon.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.976
Well, I could have
told you that.

15:04.129 --> 15:06.629
But this...
this is a little different.

15:06.722 --> 15:08.197
Wait, uh...

15:09.467 --> 15:11.225
So, were you really cut
from your residency

15:11.244 --> 15:13.244
for harming a patient?

15:13.914 --> 15:15.821
Mostly true.

15:15.974 --> 15:18.991
'Cause I opened and closed for
my attending on a regular basis.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.235
I'd done that procedure for him
at least a dozen times.

15:21.329 --> 15:24.571
So, when he was late,
I started without him.

15:24.707 --> 15:26.758
And it was a terrible call.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.427
I'll live with it
for the rest of my life.

15:30.838 --> 15:33.580
But I was young and arrogant.

15:33.675 --> 15:35.767
Can't really dock you
for youthful arrogance.

15:35.994 --> 15:38.828
It's kind of my signature move.

15:38.921 --> 15:42.315
But are you okay? Seriously.

15:44.352 --> 15:47.503
Like you said,
it can happen to anyone.

15:47.596 --> 15:49.322
Don't worry about me.

15:58.107 --> 16:00.016
Double shift's almost over.
How you holding up?

16:00.034 --> 16:01.709
My feet are killing me.

16:03.037 --> 16:04.687
And I'm too tired to rub them.

16:04.706 --> 16:06.798
Message received. Scoot.

16:07.025 --> 16:09.192
-Come here.
-Hmm.

16:09.285 --> 16:11.711
Another recruiter reached out.

16:11.863 --> 16:14.363
This time to talk about a travel
nurse gig in Sacramento.

16:14.382 --> 16:16.307
Did this one take no
for an answer?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.268
I, um...

16:20.963 --> 16:22.997
I might not have told her no.

16:23.057 --> 16:25.224
I thought we agreed
moving wasn't an option.

16:25.376 --> 16:26.800
Chastain is our home.

16:26.820 --> 16:30.046
It's starting to feel like
a shelter for battered nurses.

16:30.048 --> 16:32.048
You know I love Chastain,

16:32.141 --> 16:34.066
but I don't know how long
I can take pulling triple duty.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.901
This nursing shortage
has been hard,

16:35.996 --> 16:37.737
-but it's temporary.
-Which means

16:37.831 --> 16:39.956
it could be two weeks
or two years.

16:40.816 --> 16:41.774
So you're going to meet her?

16:41.926 --> 16:43.909
I won't sign anything

16:44.062 --> 16:45.728
without talking to you first.

16:45.821 --> 16:48.464
I just want to see
if the grass is any greener.

16:50.493 --> 16:51.467
Okay.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.179
(exhales) Hey, you're just
the person I wanted to see.

16:55.331 --> 16:57.164
Kit brought me up to speed
on the nursing shortage.

16:57.258 --> 16:58.574
I know you've been
stretched thin.

16:58.593 --> 17:00.259
More like flattened
to a pancake.

17:00.336 --> 17:01.502
Well, I think we found a way
to lighten the load.

17:01.596 --> 17:02.928
There's a handful
of nursing students

17:03.081 --> 17:04.096
who can start
as early as tomorrow.

17:04.249 --> 17:05.690
I appreciate the effort,
Dr. Bell,

17:05.841 --> 17:07.250
but nursing students
aren't nurses.

17:07.268 --> 17:09.009
-They're just more work
for us to train.
-(stammers)

17:09.087 --> 17:11.103
But they're extra hands
that we desperately need.

17:11.197 --> 17:12.846
Which reminds me, can you
scrub in on a pelvic fracture?

17:12.866 --> 17:14.106
Uh, I wish I could.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.925
My shift just ended
and I have an appointment.

17:15.927 --> 17:17.351
-Can't you reschedule?
-No, actually,

17:17.370 --> 17:20.496
and that's what I want
to talk to you about, Dr. Bell.

17:21.933 --> 17:24.083
I'm meeting with a recruiter.

17:26.695 --> 17:28.621
-You're leaving us?
-No.

17:28.773 --> 17:31.624
I mean, not yet.
I'm-I'm just testing the waters.

17:31.776 --> 17:34.777
Jessica, you are a crucial
member of this team.

17:34.796 --> 17:35.887
Especially to me.

17:36.038 --> 17:38.539
Of course, but I--
I know I speak

17:38.707 --> 17:43.352
for every other surgeon when
I say you hold tremendous value.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.046
I know.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.192
That's why I have
to explore my options.

17:54.465 --> 17:56.223
BILLIE:
Mrs. Wharthon? You can't leave.

17:56.317 --> 17:58.576
You're supposed to be getting
prepped for your laminectomy.

17:58.803 --> 18:00.136
IRENE:
That's cancelled.

18:00.154 --> 18:02.563
-BILLIE: I don't understand.
-Look, I would have to be

18:02.657 --> 18:04.898
a fool to allow myself
to be operated on

18:04.992 --> 18:07.993
by a surgeon
who killed a patient.

18:08.162 --> 18:10.755
At the very hospital
that turned a blind eye.

18:10.906 --> 18:13.649
Hey, Irene, Irene...

18:13.742 --> 18:15.000
I hear your concern.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.910
But neither
of those things happened.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.430
You expect me to believe that?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.859
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:33.020 --> 18:36.280
KIT:
Pelvic reduction forceps,
please.

18:38.509 --> 18:41.786
AUSTIN:
You know, this lack of support
is really killing my vibe.

18:42.013 --> 18:43.454
KIT:
With all the scrub nurses gone,

18:43.681 --> 18:46.440
who's going to remember
to feed your ego?

18:46.459 --> 18:49.610
AUSTIN:
Oh, I can tell you've had
a rough day today, Dr. Voss,

18:49.629 --> 18:51.370
so I'm gonna let that one slide.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.205
KIT:
Randolph.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.358
Did we call
for a general surgeon?

18:55.376 --> 18:57.260
BELL:
No, just filling in for Jessica.

18:58.045 --> 18:59.953
AUSTIN:
Randolph Bell.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.973
The man, the myth,
the scrub nurse.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.550
-(laughs)
-KIT: Ever think you'd gain

19:04.644 --> 19:06.144
two jobs in one day, darling?

19:06.295 --> 19:08.813
AUSTIN:
Uh, let's hold off
on the pet names for a sec.

19:08.964 --> 19:11.482
Looks like we got a problem.

19:13.728 --> 19:15.636
KIT:
Must have injured a vessel

19:15.655 --> 19:16.879
pulling the anterior
pelvis together.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.397
BELL:
Yeah, the pulse is present.

19:18.549 --> 19:20.825
But she must not be getting
any venous drainage to her legs.

19:20.976 --> 19:23.494
AUSTIN:
And here I thought
my services were not needed.

19:23.721 --> 19:25.721
Nurse Bell, scalpel.

19:25.740 --> 19:27.665
Thank you.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.667
Dissecting for proximal

19:29.818 --> 19:32.670
and distal exposure.

19:32.897 --> 19:35.364
Retractors.

19:35.366 --> 19:37.175
Huh. Hmm.

19:38.160 --> 19:40.011
KIT:
New job looks good on you.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.263
BELL:
Don't get used to it.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.429
AUSTIN:
All right.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.983
All right, well,
there you have it.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.010
All credit for the save

19:57.104 --> 20:00.031
goes to our exceptional
new scrub nurse.

20:11.285 --> 20:14.270
I'll be right back
to check on you, all right?

20:14.363 --> 20:15.862
What now?

20:15.957 --> 20:19.124
As hard as this is to say,
you were right.

20:19.277 --> 20:21.702
I shouldn't have said
anything about Dr. Sutton.

20:21.796 --> 20:23.429
Yeah, you think?

20:25.391 --> 20:27.116
Everything okay?

20:27.134 --> 20:29.618
Dr. Sutton submitted
an ethics complaint

20:29.787 --> 20:31.120
against a very powerful doctor
who's trying

20:31.138 --> 20:32.955
to get on the state
medical board

20:32.974 --> 20:34.957
and now he's retaliating.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.459
Whoa, wait,
an ethics complaint? When?

20:36.552 --> 20:37.735
Apparently it was
a long time ago,

20:37.886 --> 20:39.478
but that's not the worst part.

20:40.240 --> 20:45.076
The complaint was that
he is a sexual predator.

20:54.662 --> 20:57.046
(phone chimes)

21:10.770 --> 21:13.145
♪ ♪

21:47.882 --> 21:51.142
Give me your phone so I know
you're not recording this.

21:57.875 --> 21:58.724
Now yours.

21:58.876 --> 22:00.726
(laughs)
Okay.

22:00.803 --> 22:02.061
(clears throat)

22:02.229 --> 22:03.729
Here's the offer.

22:03.823 --> 22:04.822
You pull your name
out of the running

22:05.049 --> 22:06.324
for the state medical board,

22:06.475 --> 22:07.883
I'll say it was a case
of mistaken identity

22:07.902 --> 22:09.385
and withdraw my statement.

22:09.403 --> 22:11.236
Why do you care so much
about the state medical board?

22:11.389 --> 22:13.664
A predator like you has
no place passing judgment

22:13.816 --> 22:16.834
on the ethics of other doctors.

22:17.061 --> 22:19.061
We remember the past
very differently.

22:19.080 --> 22:22.423
I was 13. The law is clear.

22:28.163 --> 22:31.407
You're in no position
to give me ultimatums.

22:31.576 --> 22:32.999
You have no proof,
not one shred of evidence

22:33.094 --> 22:34.685
to back up your accusation.

22:34.837 --> 22:36.187
What you do have

22:36.338 --> 22:39.523
is a checkered past of your own
that includes malpractice.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.525
I was a resident,
and my attending

22:41.677 --> 22:43.752
was legally responsible.

22:43.754 --> 22:46.105
But I already paid the price
for that. It's long over.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.607
Clearly, that is not the case.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.785
Otherwise you wouldn't be here.

22:52.279 --> 22:56.098
I am one of the most prominent,
revered doctors in Georgia.

22:56.191 --> 22:58.358
Your word against mine,
you lose every time.

22:58.378 --> 23:02.955
-Then why are you here?
-I want my record cleared.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.641
Withdraw the complaint.

23:05.643 --> 23:08.386
That is enough of a bargain.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.288
(exhales)

23:19.306 --> 23:21.957
You have an impressive résumé,
Jessica.

23:21.976 --> 23:24.460
There are a dozen hospitals
that would kill

23:24.478 --> 23:25.569
to have you on their roster.

23:25.796 --> 23:28.054
Any of these hospitals
happen to be in Georgia?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.632
Atlanta, specifically?

23:29.650 --> 23:32.635
Currently, we're only looking
to fill positions in Sacramento.

23:32.728 --> 23:34.637
Which is far away.

23:34.730 --> 23:36.305
-(grunts softly)
-Look,

23:36.398 --> 23:39.417
I have the greatest respect
for nurses. My sister is one.

23:39.568 --> 23:41.994
I know all about the scut work,
the-the double shifts.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.829
You're not appreciated
as you should be.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.907
And you're certainly
not compensated as such.

23:47.001 --> 23:48.259
But that is changing.

23:48.486 --> 23:52.321
FHM will not only cover
your relocation expenses,

23:52.339 --> 23:57.176
we will pay you $7,500 a week
for only 48 hours of work.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.011
Comes out to $150 dollars
an hour.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.439
With unparalleled
health benefits,

24:01.666 --> 24:06.168
and we will pay for your housing
as long as you're with us.

24:06.187 --> 24:08.279
-Wow.
-Not to mention,

24:08.430 --> 24:10.448
in California,
nurses are unionized,

24:10.599 --> 24:12.508
so if you decide
to stay longer...

24:12.526 --> 24:13.600
(laughs)

24:13.694 --> 24:16.120
This is an intriguing offer.

24:16.347 --> 24:19.081
(clears throat)
But I need to think about it.

24:21.035 --> 24:22.701
Well, my flight leaves
in six hours,

24:22.795 --> 24:25.445
so I'll need an answer by then.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.448
Oh.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.009
Okay.

24:33.698 --> 24:35.214
(grunts softly)

24:35.308 --> 24:37.883
(strains):
Is the pain normal?

24:37.960 --> 24:39.368
KIT:
Unfortunately.

24:39.461 --> 24:41.127
You underwent
a massive pelvic repair.

24:41.296 --> 24:43.706
The harness that saved you
almost cost you your life.

24:43.724 --> 24:45.649
It may take you a while
before you're scaling

24:45.726 --> 24:47.651
the sides of buildings again,

24:47.878 --> 24:50.379
but give it time.

24:50.472 --> 24:51.563
And, until then,
we'll try to keep you

24:51.657 --> 24:52.806
as comfortable as possible.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.366
Thank you.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.977
(gagging)

24:56.996 --> 24:59.813
That's all right, dear,
just let it out.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.249
(coughing)

25:07.898 --> 25:09.414
Sorry about that.

25:09.509 --> 25:13.585
The anesthesia used in surgery
makes most people nauseous.

25:13.679 --> 25:16.905
Surgery? Who had surgery?

25:16.907 --> 25:19.183
You did. After the fall.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.002
Don't you remember?

25:22.096 --> 25:25.505
Tara, can you tell us
where you are?

25:25.599 --> 25:26.732
(rapid beeping)

25:31.179 --> 25:33.364
This might be uncomfortable.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.349
KIT:
Absent gag reflex. Confusion.

25:36.369 --> 25:40.371
This could be a sign
of cerebellar herniation.

25:41.432 --> 25:43.374
(wind whistling)

25:54.128 --> 25:57.096
<i> BELL:</i>
<i> What exactly are you saying?</i>

25:58.391 --> 26:01.058
I'm withdrawing my complaint
against Porter.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.042
Why?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.060
If he was so sure
of his position,

26:03.287 --> 26:04.562
he wouldn't have met with you.

26:04.713 --> 26:05.563
He's scared.

26:05.714 --> 26:06.805
-So am I.
-KIT: Of what?

26:06.957 --> 26:08.548
Of where this is heading.

26:08.568 --> 26:09.975
Don't let him
get into your head.

26:10.127 --> 26:12.294
Look, I am willing
to take any blow myself.

26:12.313 --> 26:13.979
I'm tough enough to handle it.

26:14.131 --> 26:16.481
But I can't inflict damage
on you or Chastain.

26:16.634 --> 26:18.558
I won't fight a battle
I can't win

26:18.727 --> 26:20.411
if it ends up hurting
the people I love.

26:20.562 --> 26:23.163
-We're not afraid.
-We're fighting with you.

26:24.992 --> 26:27.042
Billie, has something else
happened?

26:30.756 --> 26:35.134
I got pregnant when I was raped,
and I had the baby.

26:37.079 --> 26:39.930
Uh, we've reconnected.

26:40.157 --> 26:44.493
But he's starting to ask
questions and figure things out.

26:44.511 --> 26:46.437
If he finds out
how he came into this world,

26:46.664 --> 26:48.063
it might destroy him.

26:50.017 --> 26:52.701
I have to protect him.

26:52.761 --> 26:54.445
I have to put an end to this.

26:54.596 --> 26:57.406
We'll stand with you.

26:58.175 --> 27:00.451
Whatever your decision.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.688
Hey. I got your text. What's up?

27:12.706 --> 27:14.114
Did you know Billie
had filed a complaint

27:14.133 --> 27:16.616
against a state
medical board nominee?

27:16.636 --> 27:17.801
What are you talking about?

27:17.878 --> 27:19.695
He's the one coming
after her online.

27:19.788 --> 27:22.865
Because of some interaction
they had a while ago.

27:22.867 --> 27:23.974
I think I figured out who he is.

27:24.201 --> 27:26.668
Listen, Trevor,
you need to stop. All right?

27:26.670 --> 27:28.537
-If Billie didn't tell you
any of this...
-Yeah, that's the point.

27:28.555 --> 27:30.205
Why would she hide it?
Why would she...

27:30.224 --> 27:32.207
Why would she care if I know
about an ethics complaint

27:32.226 --> 27:33.984
against some-some random doctor?

27:34.211 --> 27:35.986
I am advising you,
as your mentor

27:36.213 --> 27:37.562
and your friend,
you need to drop this.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.549
There are only two nominees
to the state medical board.

27:40.567 --> 27:43.494
Bell and this guy.

27:44.889 --> 27:46.054
His name is Robert Porter.

27:46.073 --> 27:47.331
And that's not all I know.

27:47.482 --> 27:49.892
I, um, I did this deep dive.

27:49.910 --> 27:54.338
It turns out Porter lived
in the same town as Billie.

27:54.489 --> 27:55.914
Same neighborhood.

27:56.066 --> 27:59.009
Until her family moved away,
and you know when they did that?

27:59.161 --> 28:00.660
Six months before I was born.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.071
-All right, that's enough.
That's it.
-No, no...

28:03.165 --> 28:04.740
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

28:04.758 --> 28:06.517
See, that's your problem.
You don't know anything

28:06.668 --> 28:10.521
-about boundaries, Trevor.
-Boundaries?

28:10.597 --> 28:12.505
Boundaries?

28:12.525 --> 28:14.750
Really?

28:14.768 --> 28:16.418
There was no high school romance

28:16.420 --> 28:18.011
with a football player,
was there?

28:18.030 --> 28:20.197
No accidental pregnancy.

28:22.684 --> 28:24.493
You know the truth.

28:26.188 --> 28:28.997
You need to tell me, um...

28:30.209 --> 28:35.129
Robert Porter is my father,
isn't he?

28:45.783 --> 28:48.225
She was 13.

28:49.878 --> 28:51.979
He was an adult.

28:54.049 --> 28:57.192
He forced himself on her, and...

28:58.904 --> 29:02.573
I'm the product of a rape?

29:02.800 --> 29:04.390
Trevor.

29:04.410 --> 29:09.079
All this time she was
protecting me from the truth.

29:11.992 --> 29:15.294
That my biological father
is a monster.

29:18.816 --> 29:20.832
Trevor, listen to me.

29:20.926 --> 29:24.911
You are the product
of your own actions.

29:24.930 --> 29:28.581
-You hear me?
-No.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.176
Trevor. Trevor!

29:31.328 --> 29:33.586
How's Billie doing?

29:33.713 --> 29:35.939
-Is she joining us?
-KIT: I don't know.

29:36.166 --> 29:39.276
There's a lot going on.
None of it good.

29:39.427 --> 29:40.527
(door opens)

29:45.526 --> 29:46.950
What's the story?

29:47.027 --> 29:48.952
Tara made it through
an extensive orthopedic

29:49.029 --> 29:50.770
and vascular surgery.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.197
KIT:
Then she developed signs

29:52.366 --> 29:54.182
-of cerebellar herniation.
-What do you see?

29:54.201 --> 29:55.775
BILLIE:
Right here.

29:55.869 --> 29:58.020
A traumatic Chiari malformation.

29:58.113 --> 29:59.779
It's subtle.
Trauma CTs can easily miss it.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.614
But how did it happen?

30:01.634 --> 30:03.025
There wasn't any direct trauma
to her head.

30:03.043 --> 30:04.802
KIT:
She did have that

30:05.029 --> 30:06.211
spinal fracture.

30:06.363 --> 30:08.030
-It looked stable, but...
-That can cause a tear

30:08.123 --> 30:10.290
in the dura, allowing
spinal fluid to leak out.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.477
So we need to close the leak.
First with a spinal surgery,

30:13.628 --> 30:15.312
and then the brain.

30:15.539 --> 30:16.814
I can do it.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.631
KIT:
Are you sure

30:18.758 --> 30:20.317
you're in the right headspace?

30:20.468 --> 30:22.210
No doubt.

30:22.229 --> 30:25.489
Well, I'd never bet
against Dr. Billie Sutton.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.809
As Dr. Voss is aware,
I have a hard out,

30:29.829 --> 30:33.247
so I'll take Tara to the OR now.

30:37.986 --> 30:39.394
Is she gonna fight?

30:39.563 --> 30:40.562
No.

30:40.655 --> 30:42.747
The fight is already lost.

30:42.900 --> 30:47.386
All we can do is respect
her decision and her privacy...

30:48.496 --> 30:49.596
...and back her.

30:55.245 --> 30:57.855
LEELA:
Glad to have you back
in the OR, Dr. Sutton.

30:58.082 --> 30:59.982

36:28.854 --> 36:31.188
when she was 13 years old.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.691
PORTER:
Okay, this...

36:34.842 --> 36:37.435
this is a ridiculous stunt.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.362
Test my DNA against his.

36:39.514 --> 36:42.014
I am the living proof that
everything my mom says is true.

36:42.034 --> 36:44.451
PORTER'S WIFE:
Oh, my God.

36:53.861 --> 36:55.295
(sniffles)

37:04.130 --> 37:06.130
-Is this number real?
-Really real.

37:06.283 --> 37:08.516
-And Bell signed off on it?
-Uh-huh.

37:10.120 --> 37:11.469
Aren't you gonna say something?

37:11.621 --> 37:14.564
-This is more money than I make.
-I know. Are you mad?

37:14.716 --> 37:15.974
Are you kidding me?

37:16.068 --> 37:18.568
-I have a sugar mama.
-(laughs)

37:18.795 --> 37:20.628
Yes! Hello!

37:20.647 --> 37:22.405
(smooching)

37:22.632 --> 37:24.908
I'm so proud of you.

37:25.077 --> 37:26.910
We can set up
your weekly allowance.

37:27.137 --> 37:30.080
-You can buy me a new car.
-(laughs) Okay.

37:32.492 --> 37:34.476
Hey.

37:34.494 --> 37:35.643
How was work?

37:35.737 --> 37:37.645
You rushed out pretty quick
this morning.

37:37.664 --> 37:38.904
Yeah, I know.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.498
Today was weird.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.425
But I'm here now.

37:43.911 --> 37:46.054
Are you buying a house?

37:48.008 --> 37:49.841
Are you leaving me?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.269
We need to talk.

37:53.497 --> 37:55.013
Please don't go.

37:55.165 --> 37:58.516
Look, I know
I bailed on you earlier.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.002
And I'm always grumpy.

38:01.095 --> 38:03.280
And I think about strangling you

38:03.431 --> 38:04.781
every time I step
on one of your crystals.

38:04.932 --> 38:06.724
Okay, they have
to charge somewhere.

38:06.876 --> 38:09.202
Not on the floor.

38:10.347 --> 38:13.181
The point is,
I love having you here.

38:13.199 --> 38:15.458
In Atlanta, close to me,
so if you're

38:15.610 --> 38:18.277
trying to run away, please stay.

38:18.371 --> 38:21.447
I'm not running away, Leel.

38:21.541 --> 38:23.633
I'm... adulting.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.951
Okay.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.880
Well, that's great.

38:29.032 --> 38:31.808
I've been thinking
a lot about my future.

38:31.959 --> 38:34.702
And while #VanLife

38:34.796 --> 38:36.871
has its perks, it's holding me

38:36.873 --> 38:39.799
back from what I actually want.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.485
A child.

38:42.637 --> 38:44.136
I want to have a baby.

38:44.230 --> 38:46.047
But I thought
with the leukemia, it's...

38:46.216 --> 38:48.383
I can't get pregnant on my own.

38:48.476 --> 38:51.235
That's... that's why I wanted
to talk to you.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.570
(gasps)

38:52.722 --> 38:54.572
Do you want to adopt?

38:54.724 --> 38:56.074
Or look for a surrogate?

38:56.168 --> 38:59.336
I could gather resources
from Chastain.

38:59.487 --> 39:01.896
Um, no, I, um,

39:01.915 --> 39:05.066
I want this baby to be

39:05.085 --> 39:07.418
100% me.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.013
And since we're

39:10.164 --> 39:13.091
identical twins,
I was wondering...

39:13.185 --> 39:16.001
would you give me
one of your eggs?

39:16.021 --> 39:18.096
My eggs?

39:18.248 --> 39:20.615
In your body?

39:20.675 --> 39:22.025
It makes perfect sense.

39:22.252 --> 39:24.361
You and I are
genetically identical.

39:24.588 --> 39:26.921
It would be no different
than me using one of my own.

39:27.014 --> 39:28.990
I understand, it's just...

39:32.278 --> 39:35.354
It's a lot
to wrap my head around.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.098
And...

39:37.117 --> 39:40.960
in a very real way,
it would be my kid, as well.

39:42.029 --> 39:43.788
And who would
take care of it...?

39:43.940 --> 39:45.715
Adulting, remember?

39:45.867 --> 39:49.177
This is... about me growing up.

39:50.964 --> 39:52.705
(door opens)

39:52.724 --> 39:55.058
Anyone home?

39:58.121 --> 40:00.438
Just think about it.

40:04.886 --> 40:07.404
-Hey.
-Hi.

40:08.131 --> 40:10.198
Did I miss anything?

40:16.063 --> 40:18.373
(indistinct chatter)

40:25.090 --> 40:26.756
What did the
lieutenant governor say?

40:26.908 --> 40:28.650
Well, Porter's out.

40:29.502 --> 40:32.320
And, hopefully, when the results
of the DNA test come back in,

40:32.489 --> 40:33.913
he'll lose
his license to practice

40:33.932 --> 40:35.173
in the state of Georgia.

40:35.325 --> 40:37.308
I wouldn't mind seeing him
behind bars.

40:39.271 --> 40:42.305
Does this mean you'll be
on the medical board?

40:42.441 --> 40:44.499
Looks that way.

40:44.517 --> 40:47.277
Thanks to Billie.

40:59.941 --> 41:02.292
You didn't have to do that.

41:02.519 --> 41:03.776
I did.

41:03.870 --> 41:06.946
You were incredibly brave.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.614
So were you.

41:08.633 --> 41:12.135
I'm sorry I couldn't
protect you from this.

41:13.880 --> 41:16.881
But I'm proud
of how you handled it.

41:17.033 --> 41:19.701
Are you okay, Trevor?

41:19.719 --> 41:21.644
(sniffles)
I...

41:21.796 --> 41:24.272
honestly, I-I don't know.

41:25.542 --> 41:28.876
I'm sorry, I-I think
I just need some time.

41:28.970 --> 41:32.405
Away from all this.

41:33.474 --> 41:34.991
Okay.

41:43.484 --> 41:45.560
Thank you.

41:45.578 --> 41:48.746
And I'm here if you...

41:48.898 --> 41:51.132
Okay.

42:07.433 --> 42:09.275
Hey.

42:12.346 --> 42:13.921
You okay?

42:14.090 --> 42:15.606
(smacks lips)

42:15.700 --> 42:17.258
(exhales)

42:17.351 --> 42:19.260
Yes.

42:19.279 --> 42:21.996
Or, at least, I will be.

42:25.026 --> 42:26.934
You know, tomorrow's my day off.

42:26.953 --> 42:28.936
My dad has Gigi.

42:29.030 --> 42:31.196
You want to go somewhere
with me and just...

42:31.291 --> 42:33.258
talk?

42:34.201 --> 42:36.594
I don't want you to be alone.

42:38.539 --> 42:40.515
I'd like that.
