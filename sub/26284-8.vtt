<i>Since the 1970s,
home video games</i>

00:05.131 --> 00:08.259
<i>have been coveted by children
around the world.</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:11.137
<i>I was not one
of those children.</i>

00:11.220 --> 00:12.972
What do you think?
I won it bowling.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.473
It was either that
or a Crock-Pot,

00:14.557 --> 00:15.891
and I already got
three of those,

00:15.975 --> 00:18.310
so I thought I'd surprise you.

00:18.394 --> 00:20.938
No, thank you.
Video games are for children.

00:21.022 --> 00:24.025
Sheldon, you are a child.

00:24.108 --> 00:26.944
I just blew the hot
off your SpaghettiOs.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.154
I'm sorry, Meemaw.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.631
I just don't think
it's a very productive

00:29.655 --> 00:30.990
use of my time.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.743
You're a man of science.
Aren't you interested

00:33.826 --> 00:36.912
in doing a little research here?

00:38.831 --> 00:41.125
"Brave adventurer,
prepare to enter a world

00:41.208 --> 00:42.668
beyond your imagination,

00:42.752 --> 00:45.072
where the only sound you'll
hear is your own heart pounding

00:45.129 --> 00:46.756
as you race through
the dark woods."

00:46.839 --> 00:49.467
- This sounds terrifying.
- Really?

00:49.550 --> 00:51.343
You don't even want to try it?

00:51.427 --> 00:54.138
Honestly, I'd have more fun
with the Crock-Pot.

00:55.264 --> 00:58.476
Fine. I'll just
play by myself.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.686
- That's amusing.
- Why?

01:01.353 --> 01:03.981
I guess it's the juxtaposition
of an old person

01:04.065 --> 01:06.609
using new technology.
It tickles me.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.237
What if this old person
really tickles you?

01:10.321 --> 01:11.781
I'll play! I'll play!

01:11.864 --> 01:14.742
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:17.578
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:17.661 --> 01:20.122
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:20.206 --> 01:22.500
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:22.583 --> 01:27.338
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:35.346 --> 01:37.181
I'm not getting
any younger.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.101
I have to read the
instructions first.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.437
Did you know this document
gives us specific legal rights?

01:43.521 --> 01:46.690
We may also have other rights
which vary from state to state?

01:46.774 --> 01:48.317
I did not.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.028
Well, now you do.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.989
- All right, I'm ready.
- Great!

01:54.073 --> 01:56.325
To read the
manufacturer's warranty.

01:56.408 --> 01:59.411
Oh, you're killing me.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.551
Hey, George. How y'all been?

02:13.634 --> 02:16.470
Good, good. Hey, you fixed
your place up. Looking snazzy.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.639
Ah, thanks. Even got
a new water cooler.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.643
It's got those pointy cups,
look like Madonna's bra.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.273
So, what's going on
with your truck,

02:27.356 --> 02:31.485
other than the fact
that it's got 130,000 miles on it?

02:31.569 --> 02:34.238
She's been running hot.
I'm worried I need a new radiator.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.158
As your friend and neighbor,
I hope not,

02:37.241 --> 02:40.286
but as a businessman,
that'd be pretty sweet.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.621
It could just be the thermostat
not opening right.

02:43.289 --> 02:44.665
That is correct.

02:44.748 --> 02:45.958
How'd you know that?

02:46.041 --> 02:47.459
I took auto repair last year.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.128
And you actually paid attention?

02:49.211 --> 02:51.589
I'm as surprised as you are.

02:53.174 --> 02:56.635
Now we need to put in
a name before we start.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.679
What are you thinking?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.931
We should combine
the letters in our two names,

03:01.015 --> 03:02.600
Sheldon and Meemaw.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.477
Like, uh... ShelMaw?

03:05.561 --> 03:08.772
No, using all the
letters, like...

03:09.356 --> 03:10.774
Emelda Showmen.

03:11.442 --> 03:13.402
Did you just do that
in your head?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.695
Yes, why?

03:14.778 --> 03:17.698
Never mind. Just put it down.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.745
All right, here we go.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.205
I thought I was playing.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.707
You don't know how to play.
You didn't read the manual.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.710
You're in charge, Emelda.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.378
Thank you.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.340
Should I go left or right?

03:35.633 --> 03:37.551
Why don't you try going
in that cave?

03:37.635 --> 03:40.221
Why would I do that?
It's probably dangerous.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.990
Sheldon, they wouldn't
have put the cave there

03:42.014 --> 03:43.891
if they didn't
want you to go in it.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.393
Seems unnecessarily
reckless, but okay.

03:50.105 --> 03:51.273
Dark and dangerous.

03:51.357 --> 03:52.399
I told you.

03:52.483 --> 03:54.401
Just keep going.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.739
The box was right.
My heart is pounding.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.784
All right, good news.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.577
Tell me.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.038
Well, the kid was right.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.373
It's just the thermostat.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.001
Yeah, yeah.
So how long to fix it?

04:11.085 --> 04:13.128
- Nothing, 20 minutes.
- Can I help?

04:13.212 --> 04:16.298
Well, sure. Grab yourself a pair
of coveralls and have at it.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.548
Thanks.

04:18.676 --> 04:19.677
Really?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.971
I'm paying you
so my own son can fix my truck?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.931
Well, we could have
my son do it,

04:24.014 --> 04:27.142
but we know how
that's gonna end.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.104
What are you doing?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.647
- Kill him!
- I'm trying!

04:31.730 --> 04:33.190
Well, what's
the problem?

04:33.274 --> 04:34.900
I seem to have weak thumbs.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.277
Pause it.

04:38.529 --> 04:39.905
I'm a little winded.

04:39.989 --> 04:42.324
Why don't you let the old person
give it a shot?

04:42.408 --> 04:44.952
Would you like me to give
you a tutorial first?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.746
Give it to me.
I'll figure it out.

04:47.830 --> 04:50.082
We are such different
people, Meemaw.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.251
Thank you.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.009
Die, you sumbitches, die!

05:00.092 --> 05:02.970
- Very different people.
- Die, you sumbitches!

05:04.555 --> 05:07.683
When I grow up, will I be
a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader?

05:08.726 --> 05:11.353
"Not likely." Darn it.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.688
Did you tell her?

05:12.771 --> 05:13.981
Why don't you tell her?

05:14.064 --> 05:15.399
Tell me what?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.276
Herschel offered me
a part-time job.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.278
Really?

05:19.361 --> 05:22.573
Between that and football practice,
when would you do your homework?

05:22.656 --> 05:23.782
When does he do it?

05:24.575 --> 05:26.118
Are you okay with this?

05:26.201 --> 05:27.828
Yeah, I think it'd
be good for him.

05:27.911 --> 05:31.498
I don't know, I think his
education should come first.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.459
Come on, Mom. It's not like
I'm gonna graduate

05:33.542 --> 05:35.252
"val-dictator-torian."

05:36.378 --> 05:37.421
You heard him.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.383
Fine, but I want you here
for dinner every night,

05:41.467 --> 05:43.594
and if your grades slip,
you are done.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.679
- Thank you.
- Now go wash up.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.973
And don't get grease
all over my towels.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.643
He really did know his stuff
at the shop. It was impressive.

05:51.727 --> 05:54.605
All right, well,
maybe it'll be a good thing.

05:56.065 --> 05:58.817
How about a Houston
Oilers cheerleader?

05:58.901 --> 06:02.363
"Signs point to yes."
I'm gonna marry a quarterback.

06:10.621 --> 06:11.914
<i>Over the next few days,</i>

06:11.997 --> 06:13.248
<i>I ran to my meemaw's house</i>

06:13.332 --> 06:15.209
<i>so we could save
the 8-bit princess.</i>

06:15.292 --> 06:17.503
<i>And if it's unclear
how important this was,</i>

06:17.586 --> 06:20.255
<i>let me say it again: I ran.</i>

06:21.340 --> 06:22.692
Right behind you,
monster, monster!

06:22.716 --> 06:23.884
I see him!

06:23.967 --> 06:26.095
You're losing life points,
do something!

06:26.178 --> 06:28.097
Calm down, I've got this.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.240
No, no, no,
you're going to die!

06:29.264 --> 06:30.904
We're going to have
to restart this level!

06:32.518 --> 06:34.770
Okay, we need to set
a few ground rules.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.938
Rules, love 'em.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.148
Mazes, puzzles,
panic attacks,

06:38.232 --> 06:39.525
you're in charge.

06:39.608 --> 06:43.320
Whooping monster butt,
that's my purview.

06:43.404 --> 06:44.780
Understood.
However...

06:44.863 --> 06:47.199
Excuse me. Is there
a monster on that screen?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.409
Yes, ma'am.

06:48.492 --> 06:51.495
And can two players
swing the magic sword?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.372
- No.
- So...

06:53.455 --> 06:54.998
what does that mean
as we go forward?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.251
I have to shut my yap.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.503
Attaboy.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.381
Can I still have
a panic attack?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.425
If you do it quietly.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.891
No, no, no.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.103
So me and Herschel dropped
the engine on this Pacer today.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.021
It was so cool.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.524
I had a buddy in high school
had a Pacer

07:20.607 --> 07:22.484
with the flames
painted on the side,

07:22.568 --> 07:24.488
which was funny 'cause
the damn thing caught fire

07:24.528 --> 07:26.447
during the Homecoming parade.

07:26.530 --> 07:27.757
Too bad he didn't know Herschel.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.534
He can fix anything.
Guy's a genius.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.495
You mean
a car genius.

07:33.579 --> 07:36.165
Is Dad getting his
feelings hurt?

07:36.248 --> 07:37.624
"Yes."

07:38.208 --> 07:40.127
The ball don't lie.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.254
Sorry!

07:42.337 --> 07:43.589
Excuse us.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.717
Thank you.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.719
See you later.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.897
<i>There it is!
The cyclops!</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:01.106
<i>I see it!</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:02.900
- Get it, get it!
- I'm trying!

08:02.983 --> 08:03.984
Use the sword!

08:04.067 --> 08:05.944
- Use the sword!
- Your yap is open again.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.362
Hello?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.491
What?

08:10.574 --> 08:13.118
It's past his bedtime. Let's go.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.454
Oh, come on, five more minutes?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.789
No. Now say goodnight
to your grandson.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.541
You'll play with him
again tomorrow.

08:20.584 --> 08:21.793
Good night, Sheldon.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.962
Good night, Meemaw.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.633
Don't play without me.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.092
Of course not.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.971
How old are you?

08:34.640 --> 08:36.558
And I got my answer.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.858
- Hey, neighbor, what's up?
- Sorry to bother you so late,

08:44.942 --> 08:47.486
but one of my guys
called in sick tomorrow...

08:47.569 --> 08:49.255
...so we couldn't find
the key to the palace,

08:49.279 --> 08:52.491
but then I figured out it was
in the hay behind the stables.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.575
Great.

08:53.659 --> 08:55.202
- Hey, Herschel.
- Mary.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.996
I also found us extra life
points inside a demon.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.280
There are demons in this game?

08:59.331 --> 09:01.542
Don't worry,
Meemaw cut his head off.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.586
Anyhoo, uh, I was wondering

09:04.670 --> 09:07.589
if Georgie could come by after
school tomorrow and help me out.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.467
Oh, I don't know, Herschel,
he's got football practice.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.094
- Mm.
- What's going on?

09:12.177 --> 09:14.805
Herschel's asking
if you want to work after school.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.973
Great, I'll be there.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.599
- What about football?
- What about it?

09:17.683 --> 09:19.268
I mostly sit
on the bench all day.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.037
That's because
you got to earn your way

09:21.061 --> 09:22.062
onto first string.

09:22.145 --> 09:25.065
Or I can earn some money
working for Herschel.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.442
Why don't you and I talk a bit
before you make a decision?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.861
Sorry, I... I didn't mean
to cause a problem.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.947
I'll find somebody else.
Y'all have a good night.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.532
- Night, Herschel.
- Night.

09:35.867 --> 09:36.952
Thanks a lot.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.287
You really want
to quit football

09:38.370 --> 09:40.497
- to go work in a garage?
- Hell yeah.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.416
I thought you loved the game.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.961
I do, but look at me.
I weigh 125 pounds.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.130
- That's not important.
- It's not?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.233
Every time I get tackled,
somebody's got to run over

09:50.257 --> 09:52.551
with smelling salts
just to wake me back up.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.554
Well, this isn't your decision.
You're gonna play football.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.680
You can't make me.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.766
Oh yeah? Wait and see.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.436
Screw this.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.110
<i>Even while sleeping,</i>

10:10.193 --> 10:12.571
<i>my quest to save
the princess continued,</i>

10:12.654 --> 10:15.157
<i>which was quite a departure
from my usual dreams,</i>

10:15.240 --> 10:17.367
<i>such as determining
the coolest prime number...</i>

10:17.451 --> 10:19.328
<i>which, by the way, is 73.</i>

10:21.079 --> 10:22.623
Kill it, Meemaw! Kill it!

10:22.706 --> 10:25.959
What do you think I'm trying
to do? It won't die.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.363
Maybe you need
a different weapon.

10:27.878 --> 10:30.464
I already tried the
slingshot and the boomerang.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.924
All I have left is
the damn flute.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.968
It's a piccolo.
Didn't you pay attention

10:35.052 --> 10:36.678
when the old lady gave it to us?

10:43.310 --> 10:44.686
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Meemaw.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.023
I'm sorry for waking you,
but I know how to kill the cyclops.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.775
We have to play the piccolo.

10:49.858 --> 10:50.901
<i>Ooh.</i>

10:50.984 --> 10:53.320
What a great idea, moonpie.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.446
We'll try it tomorrow.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.657
Excellent... Wait.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.702
How'd you answer your phone
so fast? It's not next to your bed.

11:00.786 --> 11:04.956
Uh, well, actually,
I was on my way to the bathroom.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.501
You know us old people
and our bladders.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.378
I'll call you right back.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.302
That fibber.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.638
You're playing
the game right now.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.931
I am not.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.266
I saw you with my binoculars.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.394
Oh. How about that?

11:25.477 --> 11:27.396
You promised not to play
without me.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.023
We're a team.
Emelda Showmen, remember?

11:30.107 --> 11:33.068
I'm turning off the game
and going to sleep right now.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.653
You'd better.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.447
I love you. Good night.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.202
Binoculars for his birthday.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.287
What was I thinking?

11:51.461 --> 11:52.713
Where's Georgie?

11:52.796 --> 11:54.506
Don't worry about it.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.007
I wasn't worried.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.510
I was practicing chitchat.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.680
Your mother's taking him
to school.

12:01.763 --> 12:04.641
That's not very efficient.
Our car's already going there.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.935
Not that it's any
of your business,

12:07.018 --> 12:08.538
but I needed a break
from your brother.

12:08.603 --> 12:12.441
I certainly understand that.
He's an acquired taste.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.692
Like Grape-Nuts.

12:13.775 --> 12:16.278
The first time I tried it,
I thought I was eating gravel.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.406
But then I put a little sugar
on it and let it get soggy.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.742
Now it's in my top six cereals.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.286
I'll try soaking Georgie
in a bowl of milk.

12:25.704 --> 12:26.830
Sarcasm?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.833
- Yeah.
- I had a feeling.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.836
The clue was you don't normally
put people in bowls of milk.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.533
I'm Sheldon Cooper's grandmother

13:03.617 --> 13:05.744
and, uh, I need to take him out
of school today.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.704
Sure. What's the reason?

13:09.247 --> 13:10.791
His Aunt Emelda's
not doing well,

13:10.874 --> 13:12.751
and has asked to see him
'fore she goes.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.169
Oh, I am so sorry.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.463
Does she want to see
his older brother also?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.173
Nah. She didn't
like him as much.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.803
Okay. I'll just
track down Sheldon, then.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.267
Boy, do I love a pop quiz.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.438
<i>Will Sheldon Cooper please
come to the main office?</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:39.069
"Ooh," what?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.699
This is hooky, Meemaw.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.451
Hooky is a serious offense.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.745
You're messing with me, right?

13:48.829 --> 13:50.622
Any other kid would be
thrilled their grandma

13:50.705 --> 13:52.749
took them out of school
to play a video game.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.042
You've known me ten years.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.086
When have I ever
messed with you?

13:58.380 --> 14:01.174
I didn't see your kid
at practice today.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.176
Everything all right?

14:03.260 --> 14:04.970
Not really.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.670
That's it? You're not gonna
ask me what's going on?

14:20.694 --> 14:23.405
I just did. You shut me out.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.824
Well, it doesn't mean
you can't persist a little.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.802
You know, this is the kind
of crap I get from my wife.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.369
I do not need it from you.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.538
Sorry.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.672
You're really not gonna ask?

14:50.599 --> 14:52.058
Oh, boy.

14:54.477 --> 14:58.440
Well, moonpie, this is it.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.108
Our final dungeon.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.861
Hard to believe.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.487
Yeah.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.744
Would you like
to fight the last boss?

15:10.827 --> 15:12.329
You think I'm ready?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.331
We couldn't have gotten here
without you.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.350
Well, except for the part
you did when I was sleeping.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.085
We're having a moment here.
Don't ruin it.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.550
<i>I've fought many
digital battles in my life,</i>

15:25.634 --> 15:29.554
<i>but none are as memorable
as this first one with my meemaw.</i>

15:29.638 --> 15:31.348
<i>By handing me the controller,</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:33.725
<i>she was telling me
she believed in me.</i>

15:33.808 --> 15:38.521
<i>That inside my small, fragile
frame beat the heart of a hero.</i>

15:41.566 --> 15:43.652
Behind you, behind you!
What're you doing?

15:43.735 --> 15:45.254
Hit the A. Hit...
I know, I'm pressing it.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.589
- Hit the A button.
- I'm pressing it.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.333
- Throw a bomb, throw the bomb!
- Which way?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.574
Throw the bomb.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.996
Hey. You up for some company?

15:56.164 --> 15:57.624
Sure. Come on in.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.001
Sorry about the light beer,

16:00.085 --> 16:02.253
but Brenda's got me
on this health kick.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.672
You are melting away.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.257
Shut up. So, listen...

16:07.217 --> 16:10.595
I feel bad about Georgie
and this whole football thing.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.389
Thanks, but it's not on you.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.017
I appreciate that,
but you got to know

16:16.101 --> 16:17.852
there's an upside to this.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.312
And that would be?

16:19.396 --> 16:23.441
Your son has got a special gift.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.402
A gift?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.903
We are talking
about Georgie, right?

16:26.987 --> 16:29.906
Yeah. I mean, first off,
the kid really knows his way

16:29.990 --> 16:32.909
around an engine,
which is all well and good.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.246
But when it comes
to fixing tires,

16:36.329 --> 16:40.250
I swear, I've never seen
anything like him.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.293
Tires? How do you mean?

16:42.377 --> 16:45.338
George, I've been patching flats
for 25 years.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.257
You know,
slap some soapy water on them,

16:47.340 --> 16:48.883
look for
the air bubble.

16:49.467 --> 16:53.471
But your son,
he doesn't need any tricks.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.307
He knows
where the puncture holes are.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.475
He knows?

16:58.351 --> 16:59.769
He knows.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.856
He's got a sixth sense
for tire damage.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.333
I mean,
you got to see him in action.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.526
It... it'll give you chills.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.809
You know, now that you say it,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.194
whenever we had
a leaky football,

17:09.279 --> 17:11.196
he knew exactly
where the hole was.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.909
I am telling you, your boy's
got a future in the tire business.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.788
Goodyear, Firestone, somebody's
gonna scoop him up first round.

17:19.873 --> 17:20.915
Thanks, Herschel.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.291
That does my heart good.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.045
So I guess you got two geniuses
in the family.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.628
Guess I do.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.758
Who knows,
maybe Missy'll make it three.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.635
Or it's two.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.650
I won. I saved the princess.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.403
I knew you could do it!

17:50.487 --> 17:52.530
Yes! We saved her!

17:52.614 --> 17:54.407
We saved the princess!
We did it!

17:54.991 --> 17:56.576
- We did it.
- Yep.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.751
So now what?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.253
We just return
to our ordinary lives?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.048
I guess so.

18:12.467 --> 18:17.889
Or... we could just go to
the store and buy another game.

18:21.226 --> 18:24.521
<i>Since that night,
I've battled orcs, zombies,</i>

18:24.604 --> 18:27.774
<i>Nazis, Nazi-zombies,
