WEBVTT

02:12.843 --> 02:13.633
Hmm?

02:13.635 --> 02:16.837
Hey, I've never seen you before.

02:16.839 --> 02:19.085
Are you from here?

02:19.087 --> 02:20.458
Are you alone?

02:20.460 --> 02:21.374
Come here, with us.

02:30.159 --> 02:31.656
You must be hungry.

02:31.658 --> 02:32.197
Here.

02:35.362 --> 02:37.441
My name's Pil.

02:37.443 --> 02:39.732
The Scratcher and Fluffy.

02:39.734 --> 02:41.730
If you want, you can
be part of our gang.

02:41.732 --> 02:45.184
But first of all, what
are we going to call you?

02:47.850 --> 02:49.346
Wait, I know.

02:49.348 --> 02:50.761
Gobbly.

02:50.763 --> 02:54.382
Come on, I'll explain how
things work around here.

02:54.384 --> 02:58.004
This is our city,
called Foggyborough.

03:10.036 --> 03:12.989
The motto of the city
is, to build the kingdom,

03:12.991 --> 03:16.194
one must find where
nobility resides.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.027
You get it?

03:17.029 --> 03:18.609
Yeah, me neither.

03:18.611 --> 03:20.315
The old king came up with it--

03:20.317 --> 03:21.939
Theobald.

03:21.941 --> 03:22.854
See that guy there?

03:22.856 --> 03:24.227
That's Tristain.

03:24.229 --> 03:26.601
He's the one who governs right
now, but he's not the king.

03:26.603 --> 03:28.016
He's just the regent.

03:28.018 --> 03:30.846
That's the guy who's going
to be our next king--

03:30.848 --> 03:31.387
Roland.

03:31.389 --> 03:32.219
Prince Roland.

03:32.221 --> 03:33.177
Prince Roland.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.176
Prince Roland.

03:34.178 --> 03:35.134
Prince Roland.

03:35.136 --> 03:36.091
Prince Roland.

03:36.093 --> 03:37.049
Prince Roland.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.006
Prince Roland.

03:38.008 --> 03:39.005
Prince Roland.

03:39.007 --> 03:39.837
Prince Roland.

03:39.839 --> 03:40.421
Prince Roland.

03:40.423 --> 03:41.169
Prince Roland.

03:41.171 --> 03:42.293
Prince Roland.

03:42.295 --> 03:43.167
Prince Roland.

03:43.169 --> 03:44.002
Prince Roland.

03:51.453 --> 03:53.365
To be honest, Gobbly,
we don't really

03:53.367 --> 03:55.280
care who governs around here.

03:55.282 --> 03:56.571
We're orphans.

03:56.573 --> 03:58.486
We live on the street,
and the nobles sure

03:58.488 --> 03:59.942
aren't going to take care of us.

04:02.526 --> 04:04.563
So we've got to
fend for ourselves.

04:04.565 --> 04:06.269
OK, hold on tight, Gobbly.

04:06.271 --> 04:08.850
Woo-hoooooo!

04:29.789 --> 04:31.785
Woo-hoo!

04:31.787 --> 04:32.371
Yeah!

04:41.986 --> 04:45.022
You OK, Gobbly?

04:45.024 --> 04:48.104
When we want something
to eat, we go see Crobar.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.846
This time, that pesky
sprite won't escape me.

04:57.012 --> 05:00.131
And Crobar thinks I'm
some kind of sprite.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.005
He thinks I've got magic powers.

05:02.007 --> 05:04.003
Now watch this.

05:04.005 --> 05:08.040
That sprite won't be able
to resist this mince tart.

05:08.042 --> 05:08.832
Oh, cockerel.

05:11.373 --> 05:12.828
You see that?

05:12.830 --> 05:13.785
I'm not dreaming.

05:13.787 --> 05:15.533
I know it's that pesky sprite.

05:15.535 --> 05:18.697
Now, where's he hiding?

05:18.699 --> 05:19.405
A-ha!

05:19.407 --> 05:20.487
There you are, cockerel.

05:22.528 --> 05:25.190
I didn't see that one.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.398
Now, just you wait.

05:38.263 --> 05:39.427
Pesky little sprite.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.290
I'll catch you, cockerel.

05:51.292 --> 05:52.289
Make way.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.077
Make way for Lord Tristain.

05:59.284 --> 06:01.654
What on earth are
you doing, Crobar?

06:01.656 --> 06:03.568
It's that sprite, Lord Tristain.

06:03.570 --> 06:05.900
I'm trying to catch that
pesky little sprite.

06:05.902 --> 06:07.274
A sprite?

06:07.276 --> 06:10.187
Yes, Lord Tristain, a sprite
that loves to eat mince tarts.

06:10.189 --> 06:11.894
And if I manage
to catch him, then

06:11.896 --> 06:17.347
maybe I can become a knight,
and that would be a great--

06:17.349 --> 06:18.595
achievement?

06:18.597 --> 06:20.551
Crobar, the only
thing you're achieving

06:20.553 --> 06:25.256
is proving you're
a good-for-nothing.

06:25.258 --> 06:26.837
Crobar, a knight.

06:26.839 --> 06:27.630
What a laugh.

06:35.830 --> 06:36.909
Poor Crobar.

06:36.911 --> 06:39.032
He's not even close
to becoming a knight.

06:39.034 --> 06:42.571
Anyway, thanks to him we
have mince tarts every day.

06:42.573 --> 06:44.652
Come on, pass me the ball.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.194
Come on.

06:45.196 --> 06:46.276
Here, catch.

06:46.278 --> 06:48.815
Hey.

06:48.817 --> 06:49.731
Hey, over here.

06:49.733 --> 06:50.231
Throw it.

06:50.233 --> 06:50.855
Go on.

06:50.857 --> 06:51.520
Pass it.

06:51.522 --> 06:52.853
OK, throw it to me.

06:52.855 --> 06:54.227
Here.

06:54.229 --> 06:55.932
No, you kicked it too hard.

06:55.934 --> 06:57.099
I kicked it too hard?

06:57.101 --> 06:58.347
I can do what I want.

07:06.799 --> 07:08.337
Come inside right now, children.

07:08.339 --> 07:09.295
That's the sprite.

07:09.297 --> 07:10.294
Don't go near him.

07:14.125 --> 07:14.871
But--

07:34.688 --> 07:35.061
Yay!

07:35.063 --> 07:35.685
Yay!

07:35.687 --> 07:36.226
Yay!

07:52.835 --> 07:55.581
Prince Roland, I've
ruled over this kingdom

07:55.583 --> 07:58.578
since your father died,
and I've done very well.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.449
Since I've been regent, I've
had the commoners at my feet.

08:02.451 --> 08:04.906
They give me all their
wealth, without complaint,

08:04.908 --> 08:06.196
because they fear me.

08:06.198 --> 08:09.734
I levy more and more taxes,
and they don't oppose me.

08:09.736 --> 08:12.606
And you-- you think that
because it's your birthday

08:12.608 --> 08:14.811
I'll just hand you the throne.

08:14.813 --> 08:16.186
Never.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.184
Do you know what I'm going to
give you for your birthday?

08:18.186 --> 08:19.599
This!

08:19.601 --> 08:20.016
Ha!

08:20.018 --> 08:21.181
Ha ha!

08:21.183 --> 08:22.513
Happy birthday.

08:22.515 --> 08:24.302
Here, take that.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.051
Who's the smart one now?

08:26.053 --> 08:26.884
Here, take that.

08:26.886 --> 08:30.213
Uh, Lord Tristain?

08:30.215 --> 08:32.710
I was passing by
and heard noise.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.459
You OK?

08:34.461 --> 08:35.707
Yes, yes.

08:35.709 --> 08:39.745
I just had a little
craving for chicken.

08:39.747 --> 08:40.578
Huh?

08:40.580 --> 08:41.410
OK.

08:41.412 --> 08:43.617
Well, good night, Lord Tristain.

08:43.619 --> 08:44.866
Good night, Prince Roland.

08:47.074 --> 08:48.862
It'll be your last.

09:00.185 --> 09:04.179
Hear-- Hear ye, hear ye.

09:04.181 --> 09:06.053
Oh, come on.

09:06.055 --> 09:08.842
Enough with the tooting already.

09:08.844 --> 09:10.007
Good.

09:10.009 --> 09:13.170
Hear ye, hear ye, you
citizens of Foggyborough.

09:13.172 --> 09:17.291
Today is the 20th birthday
of our dear Prince Roland.

09:17.293 --> 09:19.831
He's henceforth of age
to take the throne.

09:19.833 --> 09:23.535
Rejoice, and bring food
for the great coronation

09:23.537 --> 09:28.363
banquet for all the
nobles of the realm.

09:28.365 --> 09:29.362
Come forward.

09:29.364 --> 09:30.652
Come no, come on.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.526
Provisions for the
banquet go over there.

09:32.528 --> 09:36.730
Cold meats go in the back,
and vegetables on the side.

09:36.732 --> 09:38.187
Ah, cheese.

09:38.189 --> 09:40.893
Put that in the shade, please.

09:40.895 --> 09:41.641
Hello, good sir.

09:41.643 --> 09:43.515
And what did you bring?

09:43.517 --> 09:46.055
Lovely mince tarts
for the banquet.

09:46.057 --> 09:46.970
Mmm.

09:46.972 --> 09:47.803
Can I see?

09:47.805 --> 09:50.133
No, no, they're for the Prince.

09:50.135 --> 09:53.172
All right, over there.

10:03.955 --> 10:04.661
Go on.

10:04.663 --> 10:05.575
Eat as much as you want.

10:05.577 --> 10:06.952
But keep it down, OK?

10:14.111 --> 10:18.438
Gentlemen, damsels, make way for
the minstrels and troubadours,

10:18.440 --> 10:21.310
who will feel this
castle with music and fun

10:21.312 --> 10:23.517
on this wondrous occasion.

10:23.519 --> 10:26.889
Joy and gaiety
will feel the air.

10:26.891 --> 10:30.135
Forget about your worries,
and enjoy a happy troupe.

10:34.924 --> 10:35.463
Wow.

10:40.003 --> 10:41.332
Come on, Jiggler.

10:41.334 --> 10:44.162
Hurry up.

10:44.164 --> 10:45.370
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

10:45.372 --> 10:46.536
I'm coming, I'm coming.

10:52.198 --> 10:53.405
I'm coming, coming.

11:01.356 --> 11:02.686
Whaaaa--

11:02.688 --> 11:03.062
Jiggler.

11:07.725 --> 11:10.511
Look, Jiggler, you've got
to put a bit of effort, OK?

11:10.513 --> 11:12.218
It's the Prince's
coronation, so we need

11:12.220 --> 11:13.675
you to give it all you've got.

11:13.677 --> 11:15.173
And try to be funny for once.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.627
Ah, in that case, I think this
is a job for Mr. Destardo.

11:19.629 --> 11:21.000
Hello.

11:21.002 --> 11:23.373
No, no, no, not that puppet.

11:23.375 --> 11:24.622
Oh, come on.

11:24.624 --> 11:26.370
Please, Lugan, just
one or two jokes.

11:26.372 --> 11:28.243
I'm sure they're going
to love Mr. Destardo.

11:28.245 --> 11:30.449
No, they will not
love Mr. Destardo.

11:30.451 --> 11:32.031
Every time you take
out that puppet,

11:32.033 --> 11:33.613
you make fun of the nobles.

11:33.615 --> 11:36.485
No, no, this time it has
nothing to do with them.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.733
It's just a little riddle.

11:38.735 --> 11:43.520
What's the difference between
a rainbow and a noble at work?

11:43.522 --> 11:45.895
You might at least see
a rainbow sometimes.

11:49.349 --> 11:50.596
He's funny, huh?

11:50.598 --> 11:52.219
Jiggler, if you
disrespect Lord Tristain,

11:52.221 --> 11:53.926
he'll lock us up
under the tower.

11:53.928 --> 11:54.509
understand?

11:54.511 --> 11:56.215
Yes, Lugan.

11:56.217 --> 11:57.339
Come on, let's go.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.212
And put away that puppet.

11:59.214 --> 12:01.419
You heard him, Mr. Destardo.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.998
I'm so sorry, but you
can't go on tonight.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.579
Lugan, you're censoring me.

12:07.581 --> 12:10.201
I'm not afraid to tell
the truth to the nobles.

12:10.203 --> 12:12.199
You-- you just bow to them.

12:12.201 --> 12:13.198
You're a coward, Lugan.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.281
A coward and a jerk.

12:14.283 --> 12:15.196
Jerk, Lugan.

12:15.198 --> 12:16.237
Jerk, Lugan.

12:16.239 --> 12:17.736
You're a jerk. J--

12:17.738 --> 12:22.189
J-- J-- jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

12:22.191 --> 12:25.353
Jingle bells,
jingle..

12:25.355 --> 12:27.768
No more puppets.

12:31.848 --> 12:33.262
Hello.

12:33.264 --> 12:34.761
Hello.

12:34.763 --> 12:37.840
Do you know how happy
I am to hear you laugh?

12:37.842 --> 12:39.880
You're the first person
to think I'm funny.

12:39.882 --> 12:41.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:41.464 --> 12:43.168
Hold your horses
there, freckles.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.833
You're not the one
she finds funny.

12:44.835 --> 12:45.750
I am.

12:45.752 --> 12:47.498
You fool, you.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.328
I love what you do with
that little sock puppet.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.327
Excuse me?

12:51.329 --> 12:52.618
What did you call me?

12:52.620 --> 12:54.449
You're the old sock.

12:54.451 --> 12:56.322
This is Mr. Destardo.

12:56.324 --> 12:57.321
My name's Jiggler.

12:57.323 --> 12:58.195
My name's Pil.

12:58.197 --> 12:59.611
Make way.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.941
Make way for Duchess Alienor.

13:13.515 --> 13:15.303
Aunt Alienor, hello.

13:15.305 --> 13:18.175
Oh, Roland, my puddins.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.757
Who is this Duchess Alienor?

13:19.759 --> 13:21.589
She's Prince Roland's aunt.

13:21.591 --> 13:23.712
Oh, you're going to be king.

13:23.714 --> 13:26.667
My brother Theobald
would be so proud of you.

13:26.669 --> 13:29.996
What a great day
for the kingdom.

13:29.998 --> 13:30.787
Come closer, dear.

13:30.789 --> 13:31.662
Come.

13:31.664 --> 13:33.244
There's something you must know.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.949
A short time before
he died, your father

13:35.951 --> 13:38.946
hid a treasure, a treasure
he bequeathed to you.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.278
A treasure?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.859
A treasure?

13:41.861 --> 13:46.064
He said, in order to find it,
you absolutely have to go--

13:46.066 --> 13:47.354
Did you hear that, Jiggler?

13:47.356 --> 13:49.519
There's a treasure
hidden in Foggyborough.

13:49.521 --> 13:52.641
Oh, it would be great
if I could find it.

13:52.643 --> 13:53.972
--nobility resides.

13:53.974 --> 13:57.136
Do you understand?

13:57.138 --> 13:57.968
No.

13:57.970 --> 13:58.926
Yeah, me neither.

13:58.928 --> 14:00.008
But do think about it.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.506
And whatever you do,
don't tell Tristain.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.712
If he knew, he might--

14:03.714 --> 14:06.044
Ah, Prince Roland
and Duchess Alienor.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.207
Oh, Tristain, guess
you're unemployed now.

14:09.209 --> 14:10.498
Yes, yes.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.829
What's with all the trunks?

14:11.831 --> 14:13.203
Are you moving?

14:13.205 --> 14:15.618
Oh, I just brought a selection
of clothes for the ceremony.

14:15.620 --> 14:20.238
I want to look presentable
for my nephew's coronation.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.487
Anyways, I'll leave you be.

14:21.489 --> 14:23.318
I'll go pick out my outfit.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.359
See you.

14:24.361 --> 14:26.440
Your aunt is charming as ever.

14:26.442 --> 14:28.022
Prince, if you
would come with me.

14:28.024 --> 14:32.018
I'd like to speak with
you before the coronation.

14:32.020 --> 14:37.013
I hope that sprite doesn't
come and bother us today.

14:37.015 --> 14:39.760
Say, aren't those the mince
tarts the old man brought?

14:39.762 --> 14:43.507
I better check to see if they're
not too salty because sometimes

14:43.509 --> 14:46.295
they put too much salt.

14:47.670 --> 14:51.249
Mince tarts that bite
and move by themselves?

14:51.251 --> 14:52.248
Cockerel!

14:58.701 --> 14:59.698
Alert!

14:59.700 --> 15:01.239
Alert!

15:01.241 --> 15:03.113
There's an intruder
in the courtyard!

15:03.115 --> 15:05.900
An intruder!

15:05.902 --> 15:07.024
Pesky sprite.

15:23.177 --> 15:25.340
We have to go up to the dungeon?

15:25.342 --> 15:28.253
Yes, what I have to say
is very confidential.

15:28.255 --> 15:32.999
Are dungeons usually
this high up?

15:54.603 --> 15:56.225
No, Gobbly, that's poison.

16:03.970 --> 16:09.046
Hey, isn't that Lord
Tristain, with a sorceress?

16:09.048 --> 16:09.921
Huh?

16:14.126 --> 16:15.165
Oh, no.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.704
Gobbly, don't touch anything.

16:16.706 --> 16:18.619
You want us to get
caught or what?

16:18.621 --> 16:19.161
Huh?

16:21.077 --> 16:22.491
What are these weird potions?

16:25.572 --> 16:27.153
I think you did something here.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.889
Going up stairs and
having armor is tiring.

16:41.891 --> 16:44.760
Yes, well, whose idea was it
to walk around in armor all day

16:44.762 --> 16:45.885
long?

16:45.887 --> 16:48.007
OK, Tristain, what do
you want to talk about?

16:48.009 --> 16:49.172
The throne.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.838
I've been governing
for 15 years,

16:50.840 --> 16:53.918
waiting for you to come of
age and succeed your father.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.208
That day has come.

16:55.210 --> 16:58.787
If you don't feel ready, if
you'd rather take more time,

16:58.789 --> 17:01.493
if you'd rather wait
another year or two,

17:01.495 --> 17:03.325
I would understand.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.489
I'd understand completely.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.154
No, Gobbly.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.652
So what do you think?

17:08.654 --> 17:09.819
Would you like that?

17:09.821 --> 17:11.359
I stay a bit longer
on the throne?

17:11.361 --> 17:12.732
Oh, no, no, don't
worry about that.

17:12.734 --> 17:16.020
It's time for me to face
my responsibilities.

17:16.022 --> 17:16.978
I'll manage.

17:16.980 --> 17:19.516
Yeah, I'll be fine.

17:19.518 --> 17:21.931
I know it doesn't
always seem like it,

17:21.933 --> 17:24.848
but I'm not as big
an idiot as I look.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.255
That's enough.

17:31.257 --> 17:32.503
Quite enough.

17:32.505 --> 17:34.336
If you really want
to take the throne,

17:34.338 --> 17:36.416
there's only one thing to do.

17:36.418 --> 17:39.496
We'll have a little
toast to celebrate, OK?

17:39.498 --> 17:41.037
A small toast.

17:41.039 --> 17:42.744
Shh, doggy, don't make a sound.

17:42.746 --> 17:46.240
I'll give you a taste of
one of my special drinks,

17:46.242 --> 17:48.322
and you can tell
me what you think.

17:48.324 --> 17:51.027
A toast to my coron--

17:51.029 --> 17:52.776
your coronation.

17:52.778 --> 17:53.941
To Foggyborough.

17:53.943 --> 17:55.025
Yes, there we go.

17:59.645 --> 18:03.431
Ah, my dear Roland, I've
got a story to tell you.

18:03.433 --> 18:06.594
I think it'll interest you.

18:06.596 --> 18:09.925
It's the story of a young
boy, a young boy who

18:09.927 --> 18:12.505
looked up to his king.

18:12.507 --> 18:14.046
Long live the King.

18:14.048 --> 18:16.334
Long live King Theobald.

18:16.336 --> 18:18.083
Long live the King.

18:18.085 --> 18:20.872
He dreamt of being
cheered by the crowd, just

18:20.874 --> 18:25.076
like him, to wear the
crowd, to sit on the throne.

18:27.743 --> 18:32.527
But his destiny was to learn
magic, like his godmother.

18:34.985 --> 18:37.855
The young boy didn't
want this as his destiny,

18:37.857 --> 18:40.435
so he altered it.

18:44.601 --> 18:48.097
He developed a potent poison
to get rid of the King.

18:50.844 --> 18:56.836
But there had to be a culprit,
so he accused his godmother.

18:56.838 --> 18:58.752
It was her.

18:58.754 --> 19:02.830
She fled and took refuge in the
scariest place in the kingdom,

19:02.832 --> 19:04.870
the Cursed Forest.

19:04.872 --> 19:07.659
Today, the only thing
standing between the boy

19:07.661 --> 19:11.488
and being crowned
king is the Prince.

19:24.103 --> 19:25.432
Hey, hey.

19:25.434 --> 19:28.638
Oh dear Roland, did it
go down the wrong way?

19:28.640 --> 19:30.844
Trouble digesting
the poison perhaps?

19:30.846 --> 19:31.968
Oh, what a pity.

19:31.970 --> 19:35.339
The Prince struck down
by a mysterious illness

19:35.341 --> 19:38.003
on the day of his coronation.

19:38.005 --> 19:41.500
And I will remain in power.

19:41.502 --> 19:42.957
Wh-- Nugget?

19:42.959 --> 19:44.246
Where are you, Nugget?

19:50.618 --> 19:53.196
Oh, well, I'd better
get going now.

19:53.198 --> 19:54.695
You're not going anywhere.

19:54.697 --> 19:57.233
I'm afraid you're in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

19:57.235 --> 19:58.941
Sorry, but I can't
leave any witnesses.

20:07.435 --> 20:09.056
Is he not dead yet?

20:15.093 --> 20:17.464
Did I mix up the ingredients?

20:17.466 --> 20:18.671
It doesn't matter.

20:18.673 --> 20:21.334
First, the urgent
and then the Prince.

20:21.336 --> 20:23.999
Pesky sprite, I know I
saw you come up here.

20:27.540 --> 20:30.867
I got to get in shape.

20:30.869 --> 20:31.450
What?

20:34.865 --> 20:35.779
Prince Roland?

20:43.024 --> 20:43.854
Prince?

20:47.894 --> 20:48.849
Oh, cockerel.

20:48.851 --> 20:50.056
You OK, Prince?

20:53.929 --> 20:56.050
Oh, the sprite.

20:56.052 --> 20:57.508
Crobar?

20:57.510 --> 20:59.921
Yes, it's the sprite, and
he's bewitched the Prince.

20:59.923 --> 21:01.420
Catch him, Crobar.

21:01.422 --> 21:02.378
Catch him.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.460
Come back here.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.121
Come here, you
pesky little sprite.

21:08.123 --> 21:11.494
I'll teach you to turn
our prince into a chicken.

21:11.496 --> 21:12.451
More stairs.

21:16.032 --> 21:17.278
No, wait, come back, Prince.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.069
It was a joke.

21:21.027 --> 21:23.359
That didn't go as well
as I'd hoped it would.

21:44.421 --> 21:45.335
Ow, ow, ow.

21:45.337 --> 21:46.500
Got a stitch in my side.

21:50.039 --> 21:50.704
Excuse me.

21:50.706 --> 21:51.287
Working.

21:51.289 --> 21:52.035
Coming through.

21:52.037 --> 21:53.076
Coming through.

21:53.078 --> 21:54.494
Like a stampede of Clydesdales.

21:58.531 --> 22:00.819
Looks like you've got a
big problem, Prince Roland.

22:00.821 --> 22:04.690
And I think I'm the only
person who can help you.

22:04.692 --> 22:06.854
Luckily, I'm willing
to help you out.

22:06.856 --> 22:10.519
But in exchange I want the
treasure your father left.

22:13.058 --> 22:15.305
It's up to you.

22:15.307 --> 22:16.636
Good luck.

22:16.638 --> 22:18.218
Tore through here and
sent everything flying.

22:18.220 --> 22:19.426
It's quite insane.

22:19.428 --> 22:22.505
What is it?

22:27.420 --> 22:30.747
Oh, get away, you beastly thing.

22:30.749 --> 22:34.992
So thought about my proposition?

22:34.994 --> 22:36.284
Tristain, thank goodness.

22:36.286 --> 22:37.989
The guard just
tore through here,

22:37.991 --> 22:39.406
sending my outfits flying.

22:39.408 --> 22:41.819
You do realize what a
scandal this could cause?

22:41.821 --> 22:43.651
You have to do
something, Tristain.

22:43.653 --> 22:46.357
That guard, the one who
manhandled my outfit.

22:46.359 --> 22:48.062
It's a deal.

22:48.064 --> 22:51.893
And then there was this beast
that was very ugly, hideous.

22:51.895 --> 22:52.850
A beast you say?

22:52.852 --> 22:54.015
Where did it go?

22:54.017 --> 22:56.679
It went that way.

22:56.681 --> 22:57.845
When Theobald was king--

22:57.847 --> 22:58.802
Yes, yes.

22:58.804 --> 22:59.927
--this would never
have happened.

23:16.870 --> 23:19.865
Tell me, milady, have
you seen a sprite go by?

23:19.867 --> 23:21.029
A sprite?

23:21.031 --> 23:21.821
No.

23:21.823 --> 23:22.653
And a chi-cat?

23:22.655 --> 23:23.237
A what?

23:23.239 --> 23:24.485
Yeah, you know.

23:24.487 --> 23:26.275
It's half cat, half chicken.

23:26.277 --> 23:27.358
So a chi-cat.

23:27.360 --> 23:28.357
Oh.

23:28.359 --> 23:29.521
Yes.

23:29.523 --> 23:30.687
And I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

23:30.689 --> 23:32.768
but the chi-cat
is Prince Roland.

23:32.770 --> 23:36.431
Oh, no, poor Prince Roland.

23:36.433 --> 23:39.262
And your furry friends,
have they seen the chi-cat?

23:39.264 --> 23:40.385
No, no, no.

23:40.387 --> 23:42.633
My friends haven't
seen it, Crobar.

23:42.635 --> 23:45.505
Wait, how do you know my name?

23:45.507 --> 23:49.710
Well, it's-- it's-- it's
because everyone knows Crobar.

23:49.712 --> 23:53.789
Everyone knows that you're the
bravest guard in Foggyborough.

23:53.791 --> 23:54.330
No!

23:54.332 --> 23:55.704
Yes.

23:55.706 --> 23:57.410
Among the nobles, everyone
says that you'll soon

23:57.412 --> 24:00.990
become a knight.

24:00.992 --> 24:01.865
Oh, the Prince!

24:04.988 --> 24:05.652
My treasure.

24:05.654 --> 24:07.775
Let the banquet begin.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.204
How am I going to find
him in all of this?

24:37.206 --> 24:38.619
I'll help you, Crobar.

24:38.621 --> 24:39.244
Really?

24:39.246 --> 24:40.160
You would do that?

24:40.162 --> 24:40.909
Of course.

24:40.911 --> 24:42.033
I am a princess.

24:42.035 --> 24:43.531
It's my job to help princes.

24:43.533 --> 24:44.862
Cockerel, is that true?

24:44.864 --> 24:46.195
You're a princess?

24:46.197 --> 24:48.484
Yes, yes, I sure am a princess.

24:48.486 --> 24:49.691
OK, look.

24:49.693 --> 24:50.856
You go that way, and
I'll go this way.

24:53.190 --> 24:57.350
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please give a round of applause

24:57.352 --> 25:01.679
for the irresistible,
the hilarious Jiggler.

25:03.346 --> 25:06.715
Please try to be funny.

25:06.717 --> 25:07.174
Hey.

25:07.176 --> 25:08.007
Hello.

25:08.009 --> 25:09.380
Do you want to laugh?

25:09.382 --> 25:10.587
I've got what you need.

25:10.589 --> 25:13.336
I have one joke with
two punch lines.

25:17.125 --> 25:18.664
Punches get it?

25:22.494 --> 25:23.993
Whoa, this is one tough crowd.

25:26.490 --> 25:28.153
More funny.

25:28.155 --> 25:29.193
More.

25:29.195 --> 25:32.982
So what is square and yellow?

25:32.984 --> 25:34.396
The sun.

25:34.398 --> 25:35.270
Yeah, I lied.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.477
The sun isn't square.

25:37.479 --> 25:40.182
Remind me again why I keep
this kid in the troupe.

25:40.184 --> 25:41.514
Because he's your nephew, Lugan.

25:41.516 --> 25:42.847
Oh, yeah, that's it.

25:42.849 --> 25:44.803
Anyway, at least he's
not using the puppet.

25:44.805 --> 25:47.800
Who would like to
pull my finger?

25:47.802 --> 25:48.341
You, madam?

25:52.131 --> 25:53.087
Give me that.

25:53.089 --> 25:54.168
Hey, hey, hey hey.

25:54.170 --> 25:56.042
Let go of that, madam.

25:56.044 --> 25:57.582
That's not him either.

25:57.584 --> 26:01.244
What is brown, soft,
and smells like poo?

26:03.161 --> 26:04.158
It's poo.

26:20.102 --> 26:21.059
Any luck, Crobar?

26:21.061 --> 26:22.098
I haven't found him.

26:25.889 --> 26:26.844
He can't be far.

26:26.846 --> 26:27.843
Keep looking.

26:36.170 --> 26:37.582
How about this one?

26:37.584 --> 26:40.040
What do you call a knight
who's sure of himself?

26:40.042 --> 26:41.620
Sir-tainly.

26:41.622 --> 26:42.120
Get it?

26:42.122 --> 26:43.411
Certainly?

26:43.413 --> 26:44.326
Sir-tainly.

26:44.328 --> 26:46.158
So bad.

26:50.989 --> 26:53.192
Jiggler.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.775
Oh, hey there, Pil.

26:54.777 --> 26:56.148
Can you help me?

26:56.150 --> 27:00.519
Can you take out Mr. Destardo
to liven up the atmosphere?

27:00.521 --> 27:03.099
OK, friends, it's time
for me to introduce

27:03.101 --> 27:06.346
my partner, Mr. Destardo.

27:06.348 --> 27:08.969
Oh, no, please not the puppet.

27:08.971 --> 27:09.552
Hello!

27:12.300 --> 27:16.128
Play some music loud, very loud.

27:16.130 --> 27:19.166
Did you hear about the
nobel who paid his taxes?

27:19.168 --> 27:20.000
No?

27:20.002 --> 27:20.915
Yeah, me neither.

27:24.038 --> 27:24.828
Don't like that?

27:24.830 --> 27:25.369
No?

27:25.371 --> 27:26.326
OK, moving on.

27:26.328 --> 27:27.950
How about a riddle then?

27:27.952 --> 27:28.533
Faster.

27:31.031 --> 27:34.193
How do you recognize a thief
who steals from the kingdom?

27:34.195 --> 27:36.358
He wears a crown on his head.

27:39.232 --> 27:40.187
Louder.

27:40.189 --> 27:41.186
Faster, louder.

27:44.102 --> 27:45.057
Let me through.

27:45.059 --> 27:46.139
Out of my way.

27:46.141 --> 27:47.680
Let me through.

27:47.682 --> 27:50.512
What's the difference between
a cushion and Lord Tristain?

27:54.342 --> 27:57.837
At least the cushion
belongs on the throne.

28:02.167 --> 28:03.372
Prince Roland.

28:03.374 --> 28:04.995
The chi-cat.

28:04.997 --> 28:05.870
My treasure.

28:09.868 --> 28:10.824
Move aside.

28:10.826 --> 28:12.363
I need to get by.

28:14.530 --> 28:16.068
Here kitty chi-cat.

28:19.358 --> 28:20.272
Move aside.

28:23.021 --> 28:24.476
Don't be scared.

28:24.478 --> 28:26.349
Come here, little prince.

28:26.351 --> 28:28.347
Don't be scared.

28:42.544 --> 28:44.165
Did you like that?

29:41.610 --> 29:43.439
They're very good, Nugget.

29:43.441 --> 29:45.187
A little too good.

29:45.189 --> 29:47.851
We're going to need some
help to eliminate the Prince.

29:50.767 --> 29:52.347
It's quiet, huh?

29:52.349 --> 29:55.427
What did you say?

29:55.429 --> 29:57.008
She said, it's quiet.

30:05.086 --> 30:06.458
Ha!

30:06.460 --> 30:10.495
We sure spoiled the
nobles' dinner, didn't we?

30:10.497 --> 30:11.661
Come on, Prince.

30:11.663 --> 30:13.159
Let me take you
back to the castle,

30:13.161 --> 30:14.616
and we'll go see Tristain.

30:14.618 --> 30:17.072
He'll know how to help you.

30:17.074 --> 30:19.070
Hey, what's gotten into him?

30:19.072 --> 30:20.859
I'll take care of him, Crobar.

30:20.861 --> 30:21.817
I'm a princess.

30:21.819 --> 30:23.773
I'm supposed to take
care of princes.

30:23.775 --> 30:26.978
You can go back to
chasing your sprite now.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.893
OK, goodbye.

30:28.895 --> 30:29.685
Oh, well.

30:29.687 --> 30:31.848
All right.

30:31.850 --> 30:32.432
You see?

30:32.434 --> 30:33.431
I kept my word.

30:33.433 --> 30:34.596
I got you out of the castle.

30:34.598 --> 30:36.011
Now we have to make
you human again.

30:36.013 --> 30:38.051
We'll go see that sorceress
in the Cursed Forest.

30:38.053 --> 30:39.840
She must really hate Tristain.

30:39.842 --> 30:40.674
She'll help you.

30:40.676 --> 30:44.545
After that, I'll
get my treasure.

30:44.547 --> 30:46.501
Princess, where are you going?

30:46.503 --> 30:49.705
You're not going to
leave without us?

30:49.707 --> 30:50.664
Yes.

30:50.666 --> 30:52.620
But after everything
that's happened,

30:52.622 --> 30:56.865
Mr. Destardo and I are, well,
unemployed and looking for work

30:56.867 --> 30:57.657
right now.

30:57.659 --> 31:00.195
Could you maybe hire us?

31:00.197 --> 31:01.236
No.

31:01.238 --> 31:03.691
Are you sure, Princess?

31:03.693 --> 31:06.688
If you don't hire
us, Princess, I

31:06.690 --> 31:09.685
might have to have a word or
two with our friend Crobar

31:09.687 --> 31:12.308
about that pesky little
Foggyborough sprite

31:12.310 --> 31:13.266
he's looking for.

31:13.268 --> 31:14.473
Oh, come on, Jiggler.

31:14.475 --> 31:15.679
You wouldn't turn
me in, would you?

31:15.681 --> 31:17.927
I wouldn't, but he would.

31:17.929 --> 31:19.051
Would you stop it.

31:19.053 --> 31:20.009
He's your puppet.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.591
Oh, no, he's my human.

31:21.593 --> 31:23.713
It's not the same.

31:23.715 --> 31:24.505
Fine.

31:24.507 --> 31:25.919
You can come with me.

31:25.921 --> 31:27.043
Where are we going?

31:27.045 --> 31:29.084
To find the sorceress
in the Cursed Forest.

31:29.086 --> 31:30.207
Woo-hoo!

31:30.209 --> 31:31.375
We're going to
the Cursed Forest.

31:33.623 --> 31:35.410
Where is that anyway?

31:35.412 --> 31:37.492
Well, I don't really know.

31:37.494 --> 31:40.405
It's due west, about
a day's journey.

31:40.407 --> 31:43.361
But you really
shouldn't go there.

31:43.363 --> 31:44.859
Why not?

31:44.861 --> 31:48.522
Because the Cursed Forest is
a forest that's been cursed.

31:50.730 --> 31:53.101
Yeah, we figured
something like that.

31:53.103 --> 31:54.558
You know the way?

31:54.560 --> 31:57.180
Yes, I used to gather mushrooms
there when I was young.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.261
Back then, it
wasn't that cursed.

31:59.263 --> 32:02.009
But now it's much more cursed.

32:02.011 --> 32:03.216
Come on, Crobar.

32:03.218 --> 32:05.505
Are you really
afraid of a forest?

32:05.507 --> 32:07.752
Not just any forest, Princess.

32:07.754 --> 32:10.417
A cursed one.

32:10.419 --> 32:13.122
You want to become a
knight, right, Crobar?

32:13.124 --> 32:14.163
Yes.

32:14.165 --> 32:16.702
What if I helped you with that?

32:16.704 --> 32:17.909
Seriously?

32:17.911 --> 32:18.492
For sure.

32:18.494 --> 32:19.782
I'm a princess.

32:19.784 --> 32:20.573
It's my job.

32:20.575 --> 32:22.322
I can make anyone a knight.

32:22.324 --> 32:24.320
I just need to do that
thing with the sword

32:24.322 --> 32:25.360
on the shoulders.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.650
What's it called again?

32:26.652 --> 32:28.940
It's called dubbing.

32:28.942 --> 32:30.314
Oh, right, that's it.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.812
Take us to the Cursed
Forest, Crobar.

32:31.814 --> 32:33.601
Help us turn the Prince
back into a human.

32:33.603 --> 32:37.348
And, boom, I'll
dub you a knight.

32:37.350 --> 32:39.346
That would be an
honor, Princess.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.262
That's great.

32:40.264 --> 32:41.012
Put it there.

32:46.674 --> 32:48.545
Onward to the Cursed Forest.

32:48.547 --> 32:51.833
My humor is at your
service, Princess.

32:51.835 --> 32:53.831
And my weapon will
protect you, Princess.

32:56.331 --> 32:57.912
Cockerel.

33:04.531 --> 33:06.610
Just think, that's
actually Prince Roland.

33:06.612 --> 33:09.859
Yeah, well, that's what you
get when nobles intermarry.

33:12.814 --> 33:14.395
Now, Jiggler, a little respect.

33:14.397 --> 33:16.850
Please remember the
princess is a noble as well.

33:16.852 --> 33:17.350
It wasn't me.

33:17.352 --> 33:18.141
It's him.

33:24.345 --> 33:25.716
Make way.

33:25.718 --> 33:28.422
Make way for Princess Pil.

33:28.424 --> 33:30.337
Step aside, good people.

33:30.339 --> 33:31.793
Make way.

33:31.795 --> 33:33.834
Crobar, do you have to do that?

33:33.836 --> 33:35.249
Yes, Princess.

33:35.251 --> 33:39.245
I have to make sure that you are
given the respect you are due.

33:39.247 --> 33:42.699
The respect that I'm due?

33:42.701 --> 33:43.490
Princess.

33:43.492 --> 33:45.155
Your respect, Your Highness.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.821
Greetings, Princess.

33:46.823 --> 33:48.361
Hello.

33:48.363 --> 33:49.360
Yoo-hoo.

33:49.362 --> 33:50.441
Wow.

33:50.443 --> 33:53.356
Wow, the Princess is beautiful.

33:53.358 --> 33:54.562
Your Highness.

33:54.564 --> 33:58.017
It's not that bad
being a princess.

33:58.019 --> 34:01.680
Looks like somebody's
getting a big head.

34:01.682 --> 34:04.635
Jiggler, your sock needs
to show some respect.

34:04.637 --> 34:06.301
Hey, did she call
me a sock again?

34:06.303 --> 34:07.342
Enough, Mr. Destardo.

34:07.344 --> 34:09.381
Now bow to the princess.

34:09.383 --> 34:11.920
No, I don't bow down to anybody.

34:11.922 --> 34:12.586
That's enough.

34:12.588 --> 34:13.460
Back in the pocket.

34:13.462 --> 34:14.376
No, not the pocket.

34:14.378 --> 34:15.958
Please not the pocket.

34:15.960 --> 34:16.957
It's dark in here.

34:16.959 --> 34:19.871
Let me out!

34:34.399 --> 34:35.855
Dash those worries.

34:35.857 --> 34:36.937
Sing out loud.

34:36.939 --> 34:37.894
The cat is a chicken.

34:37.896 --> 34:39.101
The chicken a cat.

34:39.103 --> 34:40.849
Together we're strong,
and nothing will stop us.

34:40.851 --> 34:42.017
Cockerel, beware.

34:44.847 --> 34:45.679
Your Highness.

34:45.681 --> 34:46.343
Princess.

34:46.345 --> 34:47.093
Prince--

34:52.299 --> 34:53.254
Huh?

35:12.195 --> 35:13.358
Dash those worries.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.482
Sing out loud.

35:14.484 --> 35:15.439
The cat is a chicken.

35:15.441 --> 35:16.773
The chicken a cat.

35:16.775 --> 35:18.229
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

35:18.231 --> 35:20.227
Cockerel, beware.

35:43.123 --> 35:43.995
Sing it.

35:43.997 --> 35:44.745
Sing it.

35:44.747 --> 35:45.451
Sing a melody.

35:45.453 --> 35:46.408
The catch is a chicken.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.658
The chicken a cat.

35:47.660 --> 35:49.405
Raise your head, and
keep moving forward.

35:49.407 --> 35:51.403
Nothing can stop us now.

36:15.007 --> 36:15.840
Prince Roland!

36:24.331 --> 36:27.409
Crobar, I'm hungry.

36:27.411 --> 36:29.365
Yes, Princess, I'll
be right there.

36:32.281 --> 36:34.402
Oh, it's too hot, Crobar.

36:34.404 --> 36:35.529
Oh, yes, sorry.

36:42.979 --> 36:44.350
Now it's too cold.

36:44.352 --> 36:46.141
A thousand pardons, Princess.

36:46.143 --> 36:47.389
I'll get you another bowl.

36:47.391 --> 36:50.178
Fetch them for my
weasels as well, Crobar.

36:50.180 --> 36:52.342
Yes, yes.

36:52.344 --> 36:54.091
There you are.

36:54.093 --> 36:55.341
Enjoy your meal, Princess.

36:59.879 --> 37:03.331
Poor dear, sleeping outside
when you're a princess.

37:03.333 --> 37:04.542
So sad.

37:20.026 --> 37:23.396
You have promised to make
me a knight, Princess.

37:23.398 --> 37:25.184
That has been my dream.

37:25.186 --> 37:28.349
I wanted to thank you somehow,
so I made this modest gift

37:28.351 --> 37:29.180
for you.

37:44.043 --> 37:45.831
Hey, watch it, Princess.

37:45.833 --> 37:48.663
You're becoming as
snobby as a real noble.

38:02.983 --> 38:03.565
Crobar?

38:06.438 --> 38:08.017
That's very pretty.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.056
Thank you.

38:10.058 --> 38:11.557
Glad to be of service, Princess.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.985
Pardon?

39:25.359 --> 39:28.561
I don't understand
what you're saying.

39:28.563 --> 39:30.893
What are you doing here?

39:30.895 --> 39:31.932
Ahh.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.390
I need to make some
people disappear,

39:34.392 --> 39:36.014
and I'll pay you for it.

39:41.966 --> 39:44.420
Ah, yes.

39:44.422 --> 39:47.501
Eliminating people
for a little money.

39:47.503 --> 39:49.914
We can do that for
sure, but it's a shame.

39:49.916 --> 39:50.456
Really?

39:50.458 --> 39:51.788
Why's that?

39:51.790 --> 39:56.159
Because right now we've
got a subscription plan!

39:56.161 --> 39:57.741
Subscription plan?

39:57.743 --> 40:01.154
Yes, we offer quality
service, professionalism.

40:01.156 --> 40:02.652
We adapt to each client.

40:02.654 --> 40:05.359
Satisfaction guaranteed.

40:05.361 --> 40:08.521
For example, with our
special ambassador plus,

40:08.523 --> 40:10.644
you can have unlimited
assassinations

40:10.646 --> 40:15.015
on whoever you please,
with a bonus of torture.

40:15.017 --> 40:16.846
We

40:16.848 --> 40:18.720
We plunder.

40:18.722 --> 40:19.719
We burn.

40:19.721 --> 40:21.884
And we hurt little kitty cats.

40:25.007 --> 40:27.627
Oh, no, we stopped doing that.

40:27.629 --> 40:28.501
Sorry.

40:28.503 --> 40:29.709
All right, then.

40:29.711 --> 40:31.373
I guess I'll take
the ambassador plus.

40:31.375 --> 40:32.456
Yeah!

40:32.458 --> 40:34.995
Ambassador plus,
ambassador plus.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.244
Congratulations.

40:36.246 --> 40:38.658
However, the ambassador
plus subscription,

40:38.660 --> 40:42.155
as you can imagine,
costs a little extra.

40:42.157 --> 40:43.655
Money is not a problem.

40:46.901 --> 40:49.273
Now, the four individuals
that must disappear.

40:49.275 --> 40:50.688
Four?

40:50.690 --> 40:53.186
I'm afraid four is too many
for the ambassador plus.

40:53.188 --> 40:56.099
You're going to need to sign
up for the premium plan.

40:56.101 --> 40:57.972
Yeah, premium plan.

40:57.974 --> 40:59.762
Premium plan.

40:59.764 --> 41:00.469
Oh, all right.

41:00.471 --> 41:02.509
I'll take the pre--

41:02.511 --> 41:05.506
are you trying to play
me for a fool here?

41:05.508 --> 41:07.005
Yes, I guess I am.

41:07.007 --> 41:08.461
Well, at least I tried.

41:08.463 --> 41:11.001
So who are the four individuals
you want to disappear?

41:11.003 --> 41:15.996
These guards-- will you
let me finish my sentence?

41:15.998 --> 41:17.994
What I was going to
say was, these guards

41:17.996 --> 41:19.824
will show you the
way they're headed.

41:19.826 --> 41:22.075
But now they won't be
able to do anything.

41:25.239 --> 41:27.692
Come on, follow me.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.940
I'm really tired of this lot.

41:43.345 --> 41:46.008
Be careful because from
here on in it's cursed.

41:46.010 --> 41:48.671
And over there is
really, really cursed.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.919
This isn't too bad, but
it's cursed just the same.

41:50.921 --> 41:52.334
So be careful.

41:52.336 --> 41:53.167
Yoo-hoo.

41:53.169 --> 41:54.915
Sorceress, yoo-hoo.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.663
Where are you?

41:56.665 --> 41:59.202
For 15 years, she's been
living here all alone?

41:59.204 --> 42:00.326
Maybe she's gone a little--

42:00.328 --> 42:01.492
A little what?

42:01.494 --> 42:03.490
A little nutso.

42:03.492 --> 42:06.653
And this coming from a
guy who talks to a sock.

42:06.655 --> 42:09.650
Look, we'll have a better chance
of finding her if we split up.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.772
Everybody choose a path to take.

42:11.774 --> 42:12.566
Good luck.

42:15.022 --> 42:19.224
OK, splitting up in
the Cursed Forest.

42:19.226 --> 42:21.180
Good idea.

42:21.182 --> 42:22.512
All right, be brave.

42:22.514 --> 42:24.635
You won't let some
Cursed Forest scare us.

42:24.637 --> 42:25.176
No sir.

42:29.008 --> 42:30.796
It's just a forest
that's a bit cursed.

42:36.334 --> 42:39.329
Madam sorceress, yoo-hoo.

42:39.331 --> 42:41.659
Hey, Jiggler.

42:41.661 --> 42:43.366
You want to quit
jiggling so much?

42:43.368 --> 42:45.323
I think I might have
heard something.

42:59.477 --> 43:02.015
Oh, cockerel.

43:03.932 --> 43:04.470
Hmm?

43:14.087 --> 43:15.002
Huh?

43:17.834 --> 43:19.164
Crobar.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.329
Jiggler.

43:20.331 --> 43:21.495
Over here.

43:21.497 --> 43:22.827
Did you find something?

43:25.160 --> 43:28.321
Yes, look over here.

43:28.323 --> 43:29.945
The sorceress left
her footprints.

43:29.947 --> 43:34.190
But they stop right here,
as if she flew away.

43:39.521 --> 43:41.433
Did you hear that?

43:41.435 --> 43:44.389
Yes, that sounds close.

43:44.391 --> 43:49.425
At this very moment, she
could be right behind us.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.131
Let's all turn around
at the same time.

43:52.133 --> 43:53.088
Yeah, all right.

43:53.090 --> 43:53.880
We'll turn on 3.

43:53.882 --> 43:54.837
Ready?

43:54.839 --> 43:56.835
1.

43:56.837 --> 43:58.001
2.

43:58.003 --> 44:00.831
2 and 1/2.

44:00.833 --> 44:03.328
3.

44:03.330 --> 44:04.536
I guess she's not here.

44:09.449 --> 44:11.527
You don't belong in here.

44:11.529 --> 44:13.151
Get out right now.

44:13.153 --> 44:16.817
But we need your help to save
the prince of Foggyborough.

44:20.896 --> 44:23.350
I don't care about
Foggyborough, and I

44:23.352 --> 44:25.181
don't care about the Prince.

44:25.183 --> 44:28.303
Now get out of here.

44:32.384 --> 44:34.005
Wait, what are you
doing, Princess?

45:09.681 --> 45:10.219
Huh?

45:15.300 --> 45:17.462
It's the story of a young boy.

45:17.464 --> 45:21.333
He developed a potent poison
to get rid of the King,

45:21.335 --> 45:23.914
so he accused his godmother.

45:23.916 --> 45:25.121
It was her!

45:35.655 --> 45:38.525
You're a stubborn one.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.897
I know you weren't the
one who poisoned Theobald.

45:40.899 --> 45:43.311
I know that you
are a good person.

45:43.313 --> 45:45.933
You will help us save
the Prince, right?

45:45.935 --> 45:46.849
I've changed.

45:46.851 --> 45:48.681
You don't know what
it's like to be

45:48.683 --> 45:52.843
hunted, to live alone like an
animal to avoid being captured.

45:52.845 --> 45:56.839
Yes, I know exactly
what it's like.

45:56.841 --> 45:59.504
But if you help me
save the Prince,

45:59.506 --> 46:01.752
that will all change for me.

46:15.781 --> 46:16.487
It's fine.

46:16.489 --> 46:17.111
She's going to help us.

46:17.113 --> 46:17.696
Yeah?

46:20.360 --> 46:25.269
We must act fast, or the Prince
will stay like this forever.

46:27.977 --> 46:31.264
To prepare the antidote,
I'll need one very

46:31.266 --> 46:33.262
special ingredient.

46:33.264 --> 46:35.134
And what would that be?

46:35.136 --> 46:38.048
The dung from a unicorn.

46:38.050 --> 46:39.796
Do unicorns really poo?

46:39.798 --> 46:40.713
Yes.

46:40.715 --> 46:42.835
And there's only
one place on Earth

46:42.837 --> 46:45.374
you can find the
dung of a unicorn,

46:45.376 --> 46:48.746
in the Glen of the Beast.

46:48.748 --> 46:49.869
A beast?

46:49.871 --> 46:51.327
Like a werewolf?

46:51.329 --> 46:53.408
No.

46:53.410 --> 46:58.028
This beast is much
worse than a werewolf.

46:58.030 --> 47:02.441
You will take the mountain
path until you reach the Glen.

47:02.443 --> 47:04.647
When you get there,
don't linger.

47:04.649 --> 47:07.269
Pick up the poo, and
get out of there.

47:07.271 --> 47:11.889
Whatever you do, stay
out of the shade.

47:11.891 --> 47:12.721
Hold on.

47:12.723 --> 47:14.719
Is this going to be dangerous?

47:14.721 --> 47:17.301
You came into the Cursed
Forest, looking for a sorceress

47:17.303 --> 47:20.339
to break the spell that turned
the Prince into a chi-cat.

47:20.341 --> 47:22.172
Yes, it's going to be dangerous.

47:22.174 --> 47:23.794
What did you expect?

47:23.796 --> 47:25.917
Well, if it's dangerous, we'd
better leave the Prince here,

47:25.919 --> 47:26.749
right?

47:26.751 --> 47:29.746
Yes, he'll be safe here with me.

47:29.748 --> 47:30.454
Oh, yeah?

47:30.456 --> 47:31.786
See that, Jiggler?

47:31.788 --> 47:35.865
Turns out the sorceress
isn't nutso after all.

47:35.867 --> 47:37.447
Yum, yum.

47:37.449 --> 47:38.532
Yum, yum, yum.

47:44.858 --> 47:46.313
Come on, Nugget.

47:46.315 --> 47:47.437
Find them.

48:07.835 --> 48:08.957
There you go.

48:08.959 --> 48:10.830
At least with this,
you won't catch a cold.

48:10.832 --> 48:11.829
Thanks, Crobar.

48:15.869 --> 48:17.282
That's funny.

48:17.284 --> 48:20.778
With that hood on, she reminds
me of the Foggyborough sprite.

48:20.780 --> 48:22.611
Oh, yeah, you're right, Crobar.

48:22.613 --> 48:23.859
Go on, catch her.

48:23.861 --> 48:24.858
Catch her.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.315
No, no, no, no,
it's a joke, Crobar.

48:26.317 --> 48:27.189
He's joking.

48:27.191 --> 48:28.105
Yeah, I know.

48:28.107 --> 48:30.519
I get it.

49:12.104 --> 49:13.143
This is it.

49:13.145 --> 49:14.808
We're in the Beast's territory.

49:27.797 --> 49:29.085
The Beast!

49:29.087 --> 49:30.667
It's got me!

49:30.669 --> 49:31.333
Run!

49:31.335 --> 49:32.499
Run!

49:32.501 --> 49:34.080
Hey, Shee Shee, that's enough.

49:34.082 --> 49:35.329
Stop bothering these people.

49:35.331 --> 49:36.328
Come here.

49:36.330 --> 49:37.826
Oh, don't be afraid.

49:37.828 --> 49:42.156
She's gentle, but sometimes
she gets a little hungry.

49:42.158 --> 49:43.862
Oh, no, not my mince tart.

49:43.864 --> 49:45.486
That was my last one.

49:45.488 --> 49:49.149
Well, Shee Shee sure does
love those mince tarts.

49:49.151 --> 49:51.105
So what brings you
up around here?

49:51.107 --> 49:53.477
We're looking for a unicorn.

49:53.479 --> 49:54.851
You're too funny, you.

49:54.853 --> 49:57.057
There's no such
thing as unicorns.

49:57.059 --> 49:58.181
Hey, look, Crobar.

49:58.183 --> 50:01.220
Over there.

50:01.222 --> 50:02.510
We found it.

50:02.512 --> 50:07.006
Only thing is it's in the shade.

50:07.008 --> 50:08.670
I'll go, Princess.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.960
You sure?

50:10.962 --> 50:14.290
Yes, it's my duty.

50:14.292 --> 50:15.375
Be careful, Crobar.

50:23.616 --> 50:25.154
Unicorn.

50:25.156 --> 50:27.069
I come here every
day with my sheep.

50:27.071 --> 50:30.191
If there was a unicorn around,
I'm sure we'd have seen it.

50:30.193 --> 50:31.025
Right, Shee Shee?

50:40.183 --> 50:41.847
It's clouding over, cockerel.

50:44.846 --> 50:47.382
We don't have seasons
anymore, I'm telling you.

50:52.338 --> 50:53.085
What is it?

50:53.087 --> 50:53.917
What's wrong?

50:53.919 --> 50:54.875
What's the matter?

50:54.877 --> 50:56.832
Why are you looking
at me like that?

51:07.198 --> 51:08.902
Pil, behind you!

51:15.855 --> 51:16.936
Hey, there we go.

51:16.938 --> 51:18.934
Didn't turn out to be
that hard after all.

51:25.845 --> 51:26.842
Hurry!

51:31.215 --> 51:32.461
Come on, run, Jiggler!

51:32.463 --> 51:35.209
Run for your life!

51:35.211 --> 51:36.374
You can do this.

51:36.376 --> 51:37.456
Yes, yes, that's it.

51:37.458 --> 51:39.996
You're really going fast now.

51:39.998 --> 51:42.244
Are you flying?

51:42.246 --> 51:44.824
Oh, never mind, Jiggler.

51:48.782 --> 51:49.779
Jiggler!

51:59.104 --> 52:01.183
Princess, go find shelter.

52:01.185 --> 52:02.890
I'll take care of the Beast.

52:07.138 --> 52:08.509
I'll get you out
of there, Jiggler.

52:08.511 --> 52:10.091
Thanks, Crobar.

52:23.705 --> 52:27.032
Hey, you're hitting
Jiggler, you big oaf.

52:27.034 --> 52:28.864
Cockerel.

52:28.866 --> 52:30.320
That's all right.

52:35.484 --> 52:38.063
Oh cockerel, I dropped my poo.

52:38.065 --> 52:40.852
I think I did too.

52:47.514 --> 52:51.175
Crobar, you have proven that
you deserve to be a knight.

52:53.424 --> 52:56.503
Keep the unicorn busy
while we grab the bag.

52:56.505 --> 52:57.876
Yeah, but how?

52:57.878 --> 52:58.834
Here, catch.

53:07.161 --> 53:09.074
At your service, Princess.

53:13.987 --> 53:14.943
Come on, Shee Shee.

53:14.945 --> 53:16.316
Catch that mince tart.

53:16.318 --> 53:17.273
Get it.

53:49.993 --> 53:50.990
Yes.

53:50.992 --> 53:51.906
It's OK, Crobar.

53:51.908 --> 53:52.905
We got the bag.

54:09.181 --> 54:11.136
Come on, Crobar.

54:27.997 --> 54:29.159
Hang on tight.

54:42.273 --> 54:43.521
Come back.

54:43.523 --> 54:45.060
I told you there's
nothing to be scared of.

54:45.062 --> 54:48.724
If there's a unicorn here, I
would have seen it for sure.

54:48.726 --> 54:49.598
Oh, darn it.

54:49.600 --> 54:51.056
I split my pants again.

55:15.115 --> 55:15.822
I don't believe it.

55:15.824 --> 55:17.070
We did it.

55:17.072 --> 55:18.735
We're going to save the
Prince and complete our quest.

55:18.737 --> 55:21.191
And I'm going to
become a knight.

55:21.193 --> 55:23.022
Sir Crobar the Knight.

55:23.024 --> 55:24.896
Sir Crobar the Knight.

55:24.898 --> 55:27.227
Don't you think you
should tell him the truth?

55:27.229 --> 55:30.098
Sir Crobar the Knight.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.390
Well, you coming?

55:31.392 --> 55:33.554
Sir Crobar the Knight.

55:33.556 --> 55:34.930
Yeah, we're coming, Crobar.

56:00.280 --> 56:02.066
Yeah, that's dead.

56:07.605 --> 56:10.808
Flower of hellboar,
slime of a slug,

56:10.810 --> 56:14.347
venom from a viper, and
dung from a unicorn.

56:18.427 --> 56:20.007
Sir Crobar the Knight.

56:20.009 --> 56:22.005
Sir Crobar the Knight.

56:31.498 --> 56:32.411
There we are.

56:32.413 --> 56:34.119
The antidote is ready.

56:34.121 --> 56:35.159
Drink this.

56:55.183 --> 56:55.887
Hey.

56:55.889 --> 56:57.428
It worked.

56:57.430 --> 56:59.967
Yeah, but he's buck naked.

56:59.969 --> 57:01.008
He needs undies.

57:01.010 --> 57:02.340
Undies!

57:02.342 --> 57:04.172
Undies, undies,
undies, undies, undies.

57:04.174 --> 57:05.046
Here.

57:05.048 --> 57:05.836
It's all I could find.

57:05.838 --> 57:06.421
Thanks.

57:09.002 --> 57:10.166
There we go.

57:10.168 --> 57:13.038
Looks good, huh?

57:13.040 --> 57:14.120
Mission accomplished.

57:14.122 --> 57:15.826
We saved the Prince.

57:20.615 --> 57:23.360
I swear to honor and serve
you till I die and fight

57:23.362 --> 57:25.400
for the cause of justice.

57:25.402 --> 57:27.855
I am ready to become
your loyal knight.

57:47.837 --> 57:51.000
You can't become
a knight, Crobar.

57:51.002 --> 57:53.123
Because I'm not a real princess.

57:53.125 --> 57:58.824
I stole this dress when you were
chasing me through the castle.

57:58.826 --> 58:00.448
Huh?

58:00.450 --> 58:02.988
Wait, so you're the sprite?

58:02.990 --> 58:04.154
Is that it?

58:04.156 --> 58:07.525
Yeah, I am.

58:07.527 --> 58:09.314
You lied to me.

58:09.316 --> 58:11.396
You manipulated me.

58:11.398 --> 58:14.725
Why would you do all that?

58:14.727 --> 58:18.472
To get to the treasure
that Theobald stashed away.

58:18.474 --> 58:20.428
And I thought you
were so honorable.

58:20.430 --> 58:22.510
In fact, you only want the gold.

58:22.512 --> 58:23.967
That's the only
thing you care about.

58:23.969 --> 58:27.006
It's time the nobles learn
to share their wealth.

58:27.008 --> 58:28.254
I didn't do it for pleasure.

58:28.256 --> 58:30.086
I did it to survive.

58:30.088 --> 58:33.041
You think it's easy, being an
orphan, living on the street.

58:33.043 --> 58:34.206
Doesn't matter.

58:34.208 --> 58:36.122
That's no excuse
for being dishonest.

58:36.124 --> 58:37.495
I really trusted you.

58:37.497 --> 58:41.199
I thought you respected me.

58:41.201 --> 58:42.406
I'm an idiot.

58:42.408 --> 58:43.322
An idiot.

58:43.324 --> 58:44.114
An idiot.

58:44.116 --> 58:45.694
I'm an idiot.

58:45.696 --> 58:46.319
Crobar.

58:46.321 --> 58:47.069
No, wait.

58:49.610 --> 58:51.481
Go talk to him, Pil.

58:51.483 --> 58:54.062
It's never too late to
ask for forgiveness.

58:58.018 --> 58:58.723
Crobar.

59:11.629 --> 59:14.916
Tristain, it's been a long time.

59:14.918 --> 59:17.996
My dear godmother,
I wish you no harm.

59:17.998 --> 59:19.328
I just came to get the Prince.

59:19.330 --> 59:20.993
You're too late, Tristain.

59:20.995 --> 59:23.824
I will not let you hurt him.

59:23.826 --> 59:26.946
I don't think you fully
understand the situation.

59:38.352 --> 59:40.016
We're going to burn everything.

59:40.018 --> 59:41.306
Yes, burn everything.

59:41.308 --> 59:42.305
Aim.

59:42.307 --> 59:43.262
Fire.

59:49.758 --> 59:52.545
And you, Crobar.

59:52.547 --> 59:55.375
I knew you were a
good-for-nothing but not

59:55.377 --> 59:57.041
a traitor.

59:57.043 --> 59:58.000
No, Crobar!

1:00:09.321 --> 1:00:10.902
Pil!

1:00:20.852 --> 1:00:22.848
Pil!

1:00:29.760 --> 1:00:31.172
Tristain!

1:00:44.661 --> 1:00:45.408
No, no.

1:00:45.410 --> 1:00:46.241
Leave me alone.

1:00:46.243 --> 1:00:47.240
Pil!

1:00:47.242 --> 1:00:49.196
Pil!

1:01:06.389 --> 1:01:08.427
Lord Tristain has returned.

1:01:19.335 --> 1:01:21.831
Oh, cockerel, I'm leaving.

1:01:21.833 --> 1:01:23.162
What's happened?

1:01:28.117 --> 1:01:33.110
People of Foggyborough, I have
some very sad news to announce.

1:01:33.112 --> 1:01:36.274
The horrible sorceress,
who, as you all remember,

1:01:36.276 --> 1:01:39.021
poisoned our good
King Theobald, is back

1:01:39.023 --> 1:01:43.850
and kidnapped our prince,
with her foul accomplices.

1:01:43.852 --> 1:01:46.556
She dragged Prince Roland
into the Cursed Forest

1:01:46.558 --> 1:01:48.969
and then threw
him into an abyss.

1:01:48.971 --> 1:01:50.967
Oh, my poor darling.

1:01:50.969 --> 1:01:53.715
And now he's dead.

1:01:53.717 --> 1:01:54.963
Dead.

1:01:54.965 --> 1:01:57.170
Dead, dead, dead.

1:01:59.753 --> 1:02:01.416
Duchess.

1:02:01.418 --> 1:02:03.414
These criminals
shall be executed.

1:02:03.416 --> 1:02:05.828
After that, we'll proceed
with my coronation.

1:02:05.830 --> 1:02:07.243
Oh, yes.

1:02:07.245 --> 1:02:08.659
Since the Prince can no longer
take his place on the throne,

1:02:08.661 --> 1:02:10.823
I gladly volunteer
to be your new king.

1:02:10.825 --> 1:02:12.821
It's what Roland
would have wanted.

1:02:44.999 --> 1:02:47.328
Crobar.

1:02:47.330 --> 1:02:47.954
Jiggler.

1:02:59.984 --> 1:03:01.731
Roland?

1:03:01.733 --> 1:03:07.058
Pil, I don't want to impose, but
could you please help me again.

1:03:07.060 --> 1:03:08.015
Hold on.

1:03:41.443 --> 1:03:43.439
We've got to get to
Foggyborough before Tristain

1:03:43.441 --> 1:03:44.440
hurts our friends.

1:03:49.518 --> 1:03:51.139
You kept your promise, Pil.

1:03:51.141 --> 1:03:52.680
You saved my life.

1:03:52.682 --> 1:03:54.678
You've earned my
father's treasure.

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:57.300
Look, I don't care about
your father's treasure.

1:03:57.302 --> 1:03:58.257
Really?

1:03:58.259 --> 1:03:59.506
OK.

1:03:59.508 --> 1:04:01.046
Well, that works out
well because truth

1:04:01.048 --> 1:04:04.126
is, I don't know where it is.

1:04:04.128 --> 1:04:06.249
But I thought your
aunt told you?

1:04:06.251 --> 1:04:07.456
Not really.

1:04:07.458 --> 1:04:09.204
She just said, in
order to find it,

1:04:09.206 --> 1:04:11.202
my father had left
a riddle to solve.

1:04:11.204 --> 1:04:13.824
To build-- what was it?

1:04:13.826 --> 1:04:16.821
"To build a kingdom, one must
find where nobility sits."

1:04:16.823 --> 1:04:17.987
Oh, you know it?

1:04:17.989 --> 1:04:19.569
It's the town's motto, Roland.

1:04:19.571 --> 1:04:22.316
Everyone knows it.

1:04:22.318 --> 1:04:24.439
I knew it sounded familiar.

1:04:24.441 --> 1:04:25.480
OK, hold on, Roland.

1:04:25.482 --> 1:04:27.020
This might get bumpy.

1:04:27.022 --> 1:04:29.351
Woo-hoo!

1:04:29.353 --> 1:04:30.350
Watch out.

1:04:30.352 --> 1:04:32.348
Out of the way.

1:04:32.350 --> 1:04:35.345
Excuse us.

1:04:35.347 --> 1:04:38.093
Look, the Prince in his undies.

1:04:38.095 --> 1:04:39.424
What did you say?

1:04:39.426 --> 1:04:42.879
She said, it's the
Prince in his underwear.

1:04:47.834 --> 1:04:48.582
Keep going, Pil.

1:04:48.584 --> 1:04:50.996
I'll meet you there.

1:05:01.196 --> 1:05:04.690
All right, let's get started.

1:05:04.692 --> 1:05:05.440
Stop!

1:05:09.313 --> 1:05:10.268
That's Pil.

1:05:10.270 --> 1:05:11.267
She's alive.

1:05:11.269 --> 1:05:12.225
Woo-hoo!

1:05:12.227 --> 1:05:14.181
She's alive.

1:05:14.183 --> 1:05:15.097
Huh?

1:05:15.099 --> 1:05:16.304
I thought she was dead.

1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:33.828
Jiggler!

1:05:41.156 --> 1:05:42.610
Tristain is a liar.

1:05:42.612 --> 1:05:46.524
He's the one who tried
to kill Prince Roland.

1:05:46.526 --> 1:05:47.730
What do you mean tried?

1:05:47.732 --> 1:05:50.520
I killed-- that's
not what I meant.

1:05:50.522 --> 1:05:53.434
And he's also the one who
poisoned King Theobald.

1:05:53.436 --> 1:05:54.890
That's horrible.

1:05:54.892 --> 1:05:56.514
What nonsense.

1:05:56.516 --> 1:05:59.428
Seriously, who's going
to believe this urchin?

1:05:59.430 --> 1:06:01.675
They'll believe me.

1:06:01.677 --> 1:06:05.879
Oh, cockerel, it's Prince
Roland in his undies.

1:06:05.881 --> 1:06:07.004
So he's not dead either?

1:06:07.006 --> 1:06:09.002
When I kill people and
they don't stay dead,

1:06:09.004 --> 1:06:10.417
it gets on my nerves.

1:06:10.419 --> 1:06:13.330
Listen, there's been a
terrible misunderstanding.

1:06:13.332 --> 1:06:15.995
Let me explain what
really happened.

1:06:15.997 --> 1:06:17.076
Oh, look behind you.

1:06:17.078 --> 1:06:17.784
It's horrible.

1:06:17.786 --> 1:06:18.242
What?

1:06:18.244 --> 1:06:18.992
Where?

1:06:18.994 --> 1:06:19.698
What is it?

1:06:19.700 --> 1:06:20.325
What?

1:06:22.990 --> 1:06:25.445
You lied to be king here!

1:06:28.942 --> 1:06:30.897
Don't let him get away.

1:06:30.899 --> 1:06:36.515
Crobar, I'm really
sorry I lied to you.

1:06:36.517 --> 1:06:38.347
It's all right, Princess.

1:06:38.349 --> 1:06:41.676
It's all right.

1:06:41.678 --> 1:06:45.506
You don't have to call
me Princess anymore.

1:06:45.508 --> 1:06:48.837
Whatever you want, Princess.

1:06:48.839 --> 1:06:51.708
Hey, what about me?

1:06:51.710 --> 1:06:52.335
Group hug.

1:07:01.243 --> 1:07:03.822
Catapults, ready.

1:07:13.064 --> 1:07:14.645
And fire!

1:07:25.260 --> 1:07:26.382
We can't stay here.

1:07:26.384 --> 1:07:28.172
We have to leave the city.

1:07:28.174 --> 1:07:29.838
And let Tristain win?

1:07:29.840 --> 1:07:30.919
No way on Earth.

1:07:30.921 --> 1:07:32.959
I'll teach him not to
go after my friends.

1:07:32.961 --> 1:07:35.290
And I must prevent him
from using his magic

1:07:35.292 --> 1:07:36.621
on Foggyborough.

1:07:36.623 --> 1:07:39.369
Mr. Destardo and I will
sabotage the catapults.

1:07:39.371 --> 1:07:40.617
Excuse me?

1:07:40.619 --> 1:07:42.741
All right, I'll go
get reinforcements.

1:07:42.743 --> 1:07:44.239
I'll open the
portcullis, Prince,

1:07:44.241 --> 1:07:46.279
so you can get
inside the castle.

1:07:46.281 --> 1:07:47.111
Perfect.

1:07:47.113 --> 1:07:49.026
Now let's do this.

1:08:02.057 --> 1:08:05.177
This is a rotten plan.

1:08:05.179 --> 1:08:06.466
Let's go, let's go.

1:08:06.468 --> 1:08:08.589
All right, go guard
the portcullis.

1:08:08.591 --> 1:08:10.672
George, you got the
ramparts, and try

1:08:10.674 --> 1:08:12.211
not to fall off this time.

1:08:39.977 --> 1:08:40.559
Tristain.

1:08:43.182 --> 1:08:44.428
Godmother.

1:08:44.430 --> 1:08:47.135
You must stop this madness.

1:08:47.137 --> 1:08:50.007
Why have you become so cruel?

1:08:50.009 --> 1:08:51.463
I am not cruel.

1:08:51.465 --> 1:08:54.418
I'm powerful, and I
intend to stay that way.

1:08:54.420 --> 1:08:56.001
Drink this, Nugget.

1:09:13.152 --> 1:09:13.858
Hi there.

1:09:13.860 --> 1:09:14.484
Hi.

1:09:29.969 --> 1:09:30.966
A fire!

1:09:30.968 --> 1:09:31.923
I'm on fire!

1:09:31.925 --> 1:09:32.922
Fire!

1:09:38.251 --> 1:09:42.204
People of Foggyborough, forward!

1:09:42.206 --> 1:09:43.828
Attack!

1:09:55.693 --> 1:09:56.731
Take that.

1:09:56.733 --> 1:09:57.523
That's it.

1:09:57.525 --> 1:09:59.146
Hit them hard.

1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:03.933
Throw them back.

1:10:03.935 --> 1:10:05.140
Come on, do something.

1:10:05.142 --> 1:10:06.721
Move.

1:10:06.723 --> 1:10:09.177
Hey, George, that's a mace in
your hand, not a mutton chop.

1:10:09.179 --> 1:10:11.841
And you, Alrick, are you afraid
of scratching your shield

1:10:11.843 --> 1:10:12.674
or what?

1:10:12.676 --> 1:10:14.506
Don't make me come down there.

1:10:14.508 --> 1:10:16.046
What was that?

1:10:16.048 --> 1:10:17.794
What are you doing?

1:10:17.796 --> 1:10:18.709
Me?

1:10:18.711 --> 1:10:19.667
Nothing.

1:10:19.669 --> 1:10:24.496
I was-- well, I'd
better be going.

1:10:26.912 --> 1:10:28.283
Wait right there, you.

1:10:32.989 --> 1:10:36.983
I've never seen this
guy before in my life.

1:10:36.985 --> 1:10:38.148
We're goners.

1:10:38.150 --> 1:10:39.188
Run, Jiggler!

1:10:39.190 --> 1:10:40.022
Run!

1:10:40.024 --> 1:10:41.355
Run for your life!

1:10:45.309 --> 1:10:46.681
This is bad, Mr. Destardo.

1:10:46.683 --> 1:10:48.472
No, no, we'll be safe in here.

1:10:48.474 --> 1:10:50.844
Don't worry.

1:10:50.846 --> 1:10:52.217
Maybe not.

1:10:56.508 --> 1:11:01.166
Nugget, get rid of her.

1:11:45.791 --> 1:11:49.369
Hey, what say we
just talk this over?

1:11:49.371 --> 1:11:51.119
Fire, fire, fire!

1:11:57.816 --> 1:11:58.806
Water!

1:11:58.872 --> 1:12:00.346
I need water!

1:12:08.891 --> 1:12:11.345
Jiggler, be honest with me.

1:12:11.347 --> 1:12:13.676
Do I have flaming
undies on my head?

1:12:13.678 --> 1:12:15.674
Yes, Mr. Destardo.

1:12:15.676 --> 1:12:17.589
Get them off of me!

1:12:25.291 --> 1:12:26.330
That's bad.

1:12:33.325 --> 1:12:35.488
Hey, Jiggler, I can't blow.

1:12:35.490 --> 1:12:36.987
Hold the door, Mr. Destardo.

1:12:36.989 --> 1:12:38.610
I'll take care of it.

1:12:57.135 --> 1:13:00.296
Oh, cockerel, that
was not water.

1:13:00.298 --> 1:13:02.627
What do we do now?

1:13:02.629 --> 1:13:04.043
We yell.

1:13:04.045 --> 1:13:04.835
Oh, good idea.

1:13:22.443 --> 1:13:24.813
Pil.

1:13:24.815 --> 1:13:26.811
You have to make him drink this.

1:13:34.763 --> 1:13:35.718
No!

1:13:43.922 --> 1:13:46.833
Pil needs you now.

1:13:53.245 --> 1:13:54.159
Oh, no, Pil.

1:13:58.323 --> 1:14:00.652
I need powder for the cannon.

1:14:00.654 --> 1:14:01.985
Let me in.

1:14:01.987 --> 1:14:03.983
Let me get out.

1:14:03.985 --> 1:14:05.231
Jiggler, where are you?

1:14:05.233 --> 1:14:06.938
I need powder for the cannon.

1:14:06.940 --> 1:14:08.811
I can't help you, Crobar.

1:14:08.813 --> 1:14:10.642
I'm stuck in here.

1:14:10.644 --> 1:14:14.514
Jiggler, if I hold the
door, you can go help him.

1:14:14.516 --> 1:14:15.346
Go on.

1:14:15.348 --> 1:14:17.261
But, Mr. Destardo, then you'll--

1:14:17.263 --> 1:14:19.674
yes, I won't get out of here.

1:14:19.676 --> 1:14:26.667
Mr. Destardo, what am I
going to do without you?

1:14:26.669 --> 1:14:30.373
You've got what it takes to
be a great jester, Jiggler.

1:14:30.375 --> 1:14:33.037
Me, I'm nothing but a sock.

1:14:33.039 --> 1:14:36.533
Maybe, but you're
also my best friend.

1:14:36.535 --> 1:14:40.154
You've got other friends now,
and they need you, Jiggler.

1:14:40.156 --> 1:14:43.069
I'll always be with
you in your heart.

1:14:43.071 --> 1:14:46.107
Now tie me to this
door, and finish this!

1:14:48.398 --> 1:14:49.895
See, little girl,
that's what you

1:14:49.897 --> 1:14:51.393
get for acting like a princess.

1:14:51.395 --> 1:14:53.808
No one can stop me.

1:15:16.995 --> 1:15:18.700
Hurry up, Jiggler.

1:15:26.902 --> 1:15:28.690
Goodbye, Mr. Destardo.

1:15:38.348 --> 1:15:40.344
Things are getting
hot in there, fool.

1:15:43.218 --> 1:15:44.674
Oh, mommy.

1:15:53.499 --> 1:15:54.664
I got you.

1:15:54.666 --> 1:15:55.495
I got you.

1:15:55.497 --> 1:15:56.037
I got you.

1:15:56.039 --> 1:15:56.703
I got you.

1:15:56.705 --> 1:15:58.285
I got you.

1:15:58.287 --> 1:16:00.283
I got you.

1:16:00.285 --> 1:16:01.948
Thanks, Jiggler.

1:16:01.950 --> 1:16:04.112
No problem.

1:16:11.981 --> 1:16:14.310
I've had enough of this.

1:16:21.347 --> 1:16:23.343
Guys, get out of here now!

1:16:43.367 --> 1:16:45.738
Prince Roland, raise
the drawbridge.

1:16:45.740 --> 1:16:47.069
All right, Crobar.

1:17:04.886 --> 1:17:06.050
Come on, we can make it.

1:17:06.052 --> 1:17:06.842
We can make it.

1:17:06.844 --> 1:17:07.632
We can make it.

1:17:07.634 --> 1:17:08.673
We can make it.

1:17:08.675 --> 1:17:09.674
We made it!

1:17:12.254 --> 1:17:13.585
Let her go, Nugget.

1:17:17.458 --> 1:17:18.788
No!

1:17:35.648 --> 1:17:36.687
Well done.

1:17:36.689 --> 1:17:39.225
Crobar, this potion
will slay that dragon.

1:17:39.227 --> 1:17:40.932
I'll take care of it.

1:17:40.934 --> 1:17:43.970
Come here, you filthy beast.

1:17:47.678 --> 1:17:48.675
Oh, no.

1:17:50.633 --> 1:17:52.961
Poor Crobar, did
you actually think

1:17:52.963 --> 1:17:54.876
that you could slay a dragon?

1:17:54.878 --> 1:17:56.750
You think you're knight worthy?

1:17:56.752 --> 1:17:59.913
Come on, open your eyes.

1:17:59.915 --> 1:18:01.827
You're a good-for-nothing.

1:18:04.327 --> 1:18:05.782
I'm sorry, Princess.

1:18:05.784 --> 1:18:07.988
I can't protect you.

1:18:07.990 --> 1:18:09.070
He's right.

1:18:09.072 --> 1:18:11.068
I'm a good-for-nothing.

1:18:15.316 --> 1:18:20.101
My loyal Crobar, you have
served and protected me,

1:18:20.103 --> 1:18:22.557
with honor and courage.

1:18:22.559 --> 1:18:26.678
Would you do me the
honor of being my knight?

1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:28.842
Yes, Princess.

1:18:28.844 --> 1:18:32.796
Do you swear you'll fight to
uphold justice and fairness?

1:18:32.798 --> 1:18:34.295
I swear I will, Princess.

1:18:34.297 --> 1:18:37.042
Then I hereby dub you my knight.

1:18:37.044 --> 1:18:41.663
You are Sir Crobar
of Foggyborough.

1:18:41.665 --> 1:18:44.327
I always knew you
were noble, Princess.

1:18:44.329 --> 1:18:46.824
Noble in your heart.

1:18:46.826 --> 1:18:47.823
Of course.

1:18:47.825 --> 1:18:50.903
That's the answer to the riddle.

1:18:50.905 --> 1:18:52.277
Tristain, hold on.

1:18:52.279 --> 1:18:54.774
I have something that
might interest you.

1:18:54.776 --> 1:18:58.355
"To build a kingdom, one must
know where nobility resides."

1:18:58.357 --> 1:19:01.976
Nobility is in your heart.

1:19:06.349 --> 1:19:07.178
What is that?

1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:09.052
A treasure?

1:19:09.054 --> 1:19:11.841
Yes, the Theobald treasure.

1:19:11.843 --> 1:19:14.005
You want it, don't you?

1:19:14.007 --> 1:19:16.794
Oh, yes.

1:19:16.796 --> 1:19:18.043
Then come and get it.

1:19:21.791 --> 1:19:22.331
My treasure.

1:19:26.329 --> 1:19:27.576
Gobbly, the chew toy.

1:19:37.650 --> 1:19:38.814
Just paper?

1:19:38.816 --> 1:19:41.270
What kind of treasure is that?

1:19:41.272 --> 1:19:43.601
I'll get you for
this, you little brat.

1:19:49.514 --> 1:19:51.343
You don't stand a chance.

1:19:51.345 --> 1:19:54.881
Nugget, do you want
a yummy chew toy?

1:20:40.088 --> 1:20:46.662
Princess, meeting you is the
greatest adventure of my life.

1:20:46.664 --> 1:20:47.996
Crobar!

1:21:08.517 --> 1:21:11.474
Prince Roland, you saved me.

1:21:14.678 --> 1:21:15.176
Undies!

1:21:15.178 --> 1:21:16.674
Undies!

1:21:16.676 --> 1:21:17.341
Undies!

1:21:17.343 --> 1:21:18.839
I need some undies!

1:21:18.841 --> 1:21:19.922
Come on, Nugget.

1:21:19.924 --> 1:21:21.462
Nugget, quickly.

1:21:21.464 --> 1:21:22.961
Get out of here now.

1:21:25.667 --> 1:21:28.163
And don't you ever set
foot in Foggyborough

1:21:28.165 --> 1:21:29.120
again, you scoundrels.

1:21:29.122 --> 1:21:31.243
Yeah, don't come back!

1:21:35.657 --> 1:21:37.611
Pil.

1:21:37.613 --> 1:21:38.985
Crobar.

1:21:38.987 --> 1:21:39.984
Where are you, Pil?

1:21:47.645 --> 1:21:50.473
Pil.

1:21:50.475 --> 1:21:51.223
Pil.

1:21:56.137 --> 1:21:56.967
Crobar?

1:22:00.008 --> 1:22:00.797
Crobar.

1:22:04.461 --> 1:22:05.168
Crobar.

1:22:10.123 --> 1:22:11.120
Crobar.

1:22:15.076 --> 1:22:18.071
Crobar, don't leave me.

1:22:18.073 --> 1:22:20.568
I need you here.

1:22:20.570 --> 1:22:22.608
Can you hear me?

1:22:22.610 --> 1:22:24.981
Wake up, Crobar.

1:22:24.983 --> 1:22:26.979
That's an order, you hear me?

1:22:26.981 --> 1:22:32.016
You're my loyal knight
now, and you must obey me.

1:22:32.018 --> 1:22:33.599
Don't leave me, Crobar.

1:22:37.928 --> 1:22:40.049
At your service, Princess.

1:22:40.051 --> 1:22:40.882
Crobar.

1:23:11.229 --> 1:23:12.226
Thank you.

1:23:12.228 --> 1:23:13.725
Thank you, my friends.

1:23:13.727 --> 1:23:15.972
Thanks for everything you
did for me and Foggyborough.

1:23:23.675 --> 1:23:24.672
Of course.

1:23:24.674 --> 1:23:27.044
This is it, the
Theobald treasure.

1:24:10.502 --> 1:24:12.748
Hey.

1:24:12.750 --> 1:24:13.830
I don't know you.

1:24:13.832 --> 1:24:15.204
You're not from here.

1:24:15.206 --> 1:24:16.827
Are you all alone?

1:24:16.829 --> 1:24:18.825
If you want, you can
join our little gang.

1:24:21.783 --> 1:24:23.237
This is Foggyborough.

1:24:34.604 --> 1:24:38.514
Would you like to
meet my friends?

1:24:38.516 --> 1:24:39.888
Woo-hoo!

1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:45.673
Hello, madam sorceress.

1:24:45.675 --> 1:24:48.546
So how are the
magic classes going?

1:24:48.548 --> 1:24:49.378
Great.

1:24:49.380 --> 1:24:53.000
My new pupils are fast learners.

1:24:53.002 --> 1:24:53.790
Oh, wow.

1:24:55.790 --> 1:24:59.035
Ah, Pil, have you seen how
well the construction's going?

1:24:59.037 --> 1:25:02.240
Look at that, my
father's treasure.

1:25:02.242 --> 1:25:04.696
Yeah, well, actually
the treasure is mine,

1:25:04.698 --> 1:25:08.317
but I decided to share
it with everybody.

1:25:08.319 --> 1:25:10.732
The first orphanage
in Foggyborough,

1:25:10.734 --> 1:25:14.686
and over there a library
open to every citizen

1:25:14.688 --> 1:25:19.431
to enjoy, and there a hospital
to take care of sick people

1:25:19.433 --> 1:25:20.180
in town.

1:25:20.182 --> 1:25:21.387
That's right.

1:25:21.389 --> 1:25:23.177
The treasure was a
plan, instructions

1:25:23.179 --> 1:25:26.799
for a new village King Theobald
wanted to build for his people.

1:25:26.801 --> 1:25:27.965
Hey, ho.

1:25:27.967 --> 1:25:30.504
Time to eat, cockerel.

1:25:30.506 --> 1:25:32.419
Crobar.

1:25:32.421 --> 1:25:33.875
My little princess.

1:25:33.877 --> 1:25:38.162
Come on, mince tarts
for everyone, cockerel.

1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:43.740
Hey, hey, I've got a joke.

1:25:43.742 --> 1:25:46.612
What's the difference between
King Roland and a brick wall?

1:25:46.614 --> 1:25:48.735
Hold on, let's play
some music, huh?

1:25:48.737 --> 1:25:50.317
And loud.

1:25:50.319 --> 1:25:52.815
A brick wall isn't as thick.

1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:00.307
He said, thick as a brick wall.

1:26:00.309 --> 1:26:01.139
I don't get it.

1:26:12.088 --> 1:26:13.669
Dash those worries.

1:26:13.671 --> 1:26:14.502
Sing out loud.

1:26:14.504 --> 1:26:15.667
The cat is a chicken.

1:26:15.669 --> 1:26:16.791
The chicken a cat.

1:26:16.793 --> 1:26:18.373
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

1:26:18.375 --> 1:26:20.162
Cockerel, beware.

1:26:35.524 --> 1:26:36.896
Dash those worries.

1:26:36.898 --> 1:26:37.853
Sing out loud.

1:26:37.855 --> 1:26:38.810
The cat is a chicken.

1:26:38.812 --> 1:26:40.142
The chicken a cat.

1:26:40.144 --> 1:26:41.807
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

1:26:41.809 --> 1:26:43.141
Cockerel, beware.

1:26:51.467 --> 1:26:51.922
Sing it.

1:26:51.924 --> 1:26:52.671
Sing it.

1:26:52.673 --> 1:26:53.380
Sing a melody.

1:26:53.382 --> 1:26:54.211
The cat is a chicken.

1:26:54.213 --> 1:26:55.502
The chicken a cat.

1:26:55.504 --> 1:26:57.166
Raise your head, and
keep moving forward.

1:26:57.168 --> 1:27:00.163
Nothing can stop us now.

1:27:31.759 --> 1:27:34.046
Ladies.

1:27:34.048 --> 1:27:36.170
I liked him better
in his undies.

1:27:36.172 --> 1:27:37.585
Me too.

1:28:22.874 --> 1:28:25.662
Oh, the brick wall.

1:28:25.664 --> 1:28:28.534
It isn't as thick.

1:28:28.536 --> 1:28:29.824
I get it.
