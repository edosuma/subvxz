WEBVTT

00:03.130 --> 00:03.800
Hey, buddy.

00:03.820 --> 00:04.620
Nothing!

00:04.620 --> 00:05.980
Sorry. Habit.

00:05.990 --> 00:08.290
I'm not actually
doing anything wrong.

00:08.290 --> 00:09.920
Just checking to see
if I got into a.S.U.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.320
Without us?!

00:11.320 --> 00:13.090
Guys, get in here!

00:13.090 --> 00:14.290
It's happening!

00:14.290 --> 00:15.990
Claire:
Phil saw videos online

00:16.000 --> 00:17.360
of families celebrating

00:17.360 --> 00:19.160
the moment their kid
got into college.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.100
For pure drama,
you can't beat that thing

00:21.100 --> 00:23.330
when an entire family's
nervous anticipation

00:23.340 --> 00:25.500
turns into an explosion
of utter joy.

00:25.510 --> 00:27.770
Come on!
Come on, n-y...

00:28.810 --> 00:30.140
- Notre...
- Haley:

00:30.140 --> 00:31.380
Damn.
Claire:

00:31.380 --> 00:33.780
All righty, here we go.

00:33.780 --> 00:36.510
And record and...

00:36.520 --> 00:38.720
"Welcome to Arizona state"...

00:39.990 --> 00:41.350
It's happening!
Oh, my god!

00:41.350 --> 00:43.190
"Welcome to Arizona state's
admissions portal."

00:44.290 --> 00:45.690
"We regret to inform you"...

00:45.690 --> 00:48.060
Aww, pal...

00:48.060 --> 00:49.530
Well, don't leave us
in suspense.

00:49.530 --> 00:50.530
What did they say?

01:04.879 --> 01:06.140
Hey, I just peeked in on Lily,

01:06.150 --> 01:07.850
and guess who she was
curled up with on her bed?

01:07.850 --> 01:09.680
If it's not the cat,
I'm gonna be really upset about

01:09.680 --> 01:10.880
how you're teasing this out.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.350
I love that she has a pet
that she's close to

01:13.350 --> 01:15.650
like I was with my pet pig Lily.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.560
Still no guilt, I see,
after tricking me into

01:17.560 --> 01:19.090
naming our daughter after bacon.

01:19.090 --> 01:20.890
I was very close to that pig.

01:20.890 --> 01:21.890
For heaven's sakes,

01:21.900 --> 01:23.600
I still have her ashes
in the garage.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.200
True.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.270
I recently started
exercising in the garage,

01:27.270 --> 01:28.700
and on the first day, I, uh...

01:28.700 --> 01:30.500
I dropped a couple of pounds.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.040
I knew Mitchell was lying.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.350
I was just giving him
the opportunity to come clean.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.810
I had discovered
the urn was empty.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.350
Lily?

01:49.360 --> 01:50.720
You know, I was thinking tonight

01:50.720 --> 01:52.720
maybe we could bury the ashes
in the back yard

01:52.730 --> 01:54.230
after we get back
from your dad's.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.030
It's a perfect night
to pay tribute.

01:56.030 --> 01:57.800
W-why?
The pig moon.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.760
I'm sorry?
One more time.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.230
The pig moon.

02:00.230 --> 02:03.130
Every 18 years,
the moon takes on a pink hue,

02:03.140 --> 02:05.040
and it aligns with Orion.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.300
Oh. It's a huge deal back home.

02:06.310 --> 02:07.540
There's a festival,

02:07.540 --> 02:09.910
they empty out all the jails
as a sign of goodwill.

02:09.910 --> 02:11.440
So, we're having, like,
a ceremony tonight?

02:11.440 --> 02:12.380
Yes, sweetie.

02:12.380 --> 02:13.710
But don't we have grandpa's?

02:13.710 --> 02:15.410
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Well, you know what?

02:15.420 --> 02:17.750
We're always looking for a
credible reason to leave early.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.250
So, what are we supposed to say?

02:19.250 --> 02:21.090
"No... no dessert for us.
We got to get home."

02:21.090 --> 02:22.550
We got to bury
the 25-year-old ashes

02:22.560 --> 02:23.920
"of a Brunswick king sow."

02:23.920 --> 02:24.960
Wow. Nice attitude.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.090
It's almost like
you want pig moon John

02:27.090 --> 02:28.890
to fill your hunting boot
with coal.

02:31.330 --> 02:33.330
This is so slow!

02:33.330 --> 02:35.230
If you're on
the Pritchett's closets website,

02:35.240 --> 02:36.730
we're aware of the slowdown.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.470
It's either a hack
by the Chinese

02:38.470 --> 02:40.470
or that Chinese hack
I hired to fix the website.

02:40.470 --> 02:42.010
No, I'm trying to get tickets

02:42.010 --> 02:44.280
for tonight's
Gloria Estefan concert.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.580
That's a little on the nose.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.660
Joe: Mom,
it happened again!

02:48.350 --> 02:50.620
Jay, sit down here
and pay attention.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.580
Ugh! You have to move
fast when it's your turn,

02:52.590 --> 02:54.950
or they'll move
to the next person.

02:54.950 --> 02:58.320
Joe, this is exactly why
we're not giving you a knife

02:58.330 --> 02:59.920
until you turn 6 years old.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.260
I missed the days

03:01.260 --> 03:03.430
when people stood
in actual lines.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.500
If you weren't willing
to stand in the rain,

03:05.500 --> 03:07.870
you didn't get to see
Gary Puckett & the union gap.

03:11.940 --> 03:13.340
Ow! Damn it!

03:14.770 --> 03:16.340
What?
It was one second!

03:16.340 --> 03:17.510
Gloria:

03:17.510 --> 03:19.040
Okay, give it back to me.

03:19.050 --> 03:20.010
No need. I got 'em.

03:20.010 --> 03:21.380
Oh, really? And you paid?

03:21.380 --> 03:22.680
Yeah, you got your browser

03:22.680 --> 03:24.050
filling out
your credit card info.

03:24.050 --> 03:25.120
It's not super secure,

03:25.120 --> 03:26.480
but, whoever steals them

03:26.490 --> 03:28.050
will probably spend
less than you.

03:28.050 --> 03:30.020
Oh,
what a b-u-tiful morning.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.220
I joke because
I've been accepted to b.U.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.660
Oh, Manny, I'm so proud of you!

03:34.660 --> 03:36.030
I'm six for six.

03:36.030 --> 03:38.000
So many suitors...
Not sure which to choose from.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.360
I feel like lady Mary

03:39.370 --> 03:40.900
in the last season
of "Downton Abbey."

03:40.900 --> 03:42.500
I'd avoid
the big football schools.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.170
And tonight
we're going to celebrate.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.170
We're going to a concert.

03:45.170 --> 03:46.700
I got the tickets online.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.970
Easier than buying them
at the venue, I guess.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.580
What is the venue, uh,
by the way?

03:50.580 --> 03:52.080
You can't buy them at the door.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.080
It's a private concert.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.250
It's just for the fan club.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.980
I remember our first
Gloria Estefan concert.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.480
You were so little,

03:58.490 --> 04:02.020
sitting on my shoulders,
holding the lighter.

04:02.020 --> 04:03.320
I'm gonna leave.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.520
Yes, before I know it.

04:05.530 --> 04:06.660
No, right now.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.260
I obviously need
something to wear tonight.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.430
Oh, okay.
I'll go with you.

04:09.430 --> 04:11.660
What a great idea.
Go! Make a day of it.

04:11.660 --> 04:13.330
No, wait, wait, wait...

04:13.330 --> 04:15.870
I can't go to the mall
wearing my house heels.

04:15.870 --> 04:18.000
What a good excuse to buy
a nice pair of new ones.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.670
That's why I love you.

04:21.370 --> 04:22.840
Always remember that.

04:24.210 --> 04:26.340
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Pasternak.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.110
I'm sure you're wondering why
I want these ashes.

04:28.110 --> 04:29.250
Not really,

04:29.250 --> 04:30.520
but I'm gonna need the urn back.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.120
I'm gonna turn it into a lamp.

04:40.260 --> 04:41.530
Hello, Mitchell.
Oh, god!

04:43.900 --> 04:45.130
Is everything okay?

04:45.130 --> 04:46.730
You're looking a little ashen.

04:46.730 --> 04:47.900
I'm fine.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.100
I-I... I accidentally
spilled pig Lily's ashes,

04:50.100 --> 04:51.440
and I...
I thought that I would...

04:51.440 --> 04:54.110
You would just replace them
with Morris Pasternak's?

04:54.110 --> 04:56.740
How'd you know? His class
ring is by your foot.

04:56.740 --> 04:58.910
Oh, yeah. That pig
was my best friend.

04:58.910 --> 05:00.280
Didn't you eat her mother?

05:00.280 --> 05:01.710
You know, you have no respect

05:01.710 --> 05:03.550
for anything
that's important to me.

05:03.550 --> 05:05.650
My whole upbringing
is just a big joke to you.

05:11.090 --> 05:13.790
Dad, I was thinking about
the pig moon funeral tonight

05:13.790 --> 05:15.630
and how important
Lily was to you.

05:15.630 --> 05:18.400
Aww, that is so sweet.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
You definitely inherited
her compassion.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
Remember that finger painting
that I made of her,

05:22.600 --> 05:24.800
the one that you said
that was museum quality?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.000
Can we bury it with her?

05:26.010 --> 05:28.240
I know exactly where it is.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.370
I know exactly where it <i> was.</i>

05:32.740 --> 05:34.210
Ohh.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.920
Ohh!

05:41.320 --> 05:42.620
It's an e-mail for Luke
from my Alma mater.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.790
Let's get him!
Oh, no, no!

05:43.790 --> 05:45.420
No, what if it's more bad news?

05:45.430 --> 05:46.790
Maybe you should read it first.

05:46.790 --> 05:48.590
Claire,
I am as anxious as you are

05:48.600 --> 05:50.960
to find out if he's gonna be
a bulldog like his old man,

05:50.960 --> 05:52.600
but we can't violate his trust.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.630
Sure, we could mark it as unread
to cover our tracks,

05:54.630 --> 05:55.770
but we'd know...

05:55.770 --> 05:56.770
He didn't get in.

05:56.770 --> 05:59.170
What?! He's a legacy!

05:59.170 --> 06:02.040
Bulldog drool
courses through his jowls!

06:02.040 --> 06:04.210
I know, and it's his
seventh rejection.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.010
He's gonna be so disappointed.

06:06.010 --> 06:07.380
And embarrassed.

06:07.380 --> 06:08.480
We have that dinner
at Jay's tonight.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.680
I bet Manny got in everywhere.

06:09.680 --> 06:11.480
Oh, god.

06:11.480 --> 06:12.620
Is this it?

06:12.620 --> 06:14.320
I mean, is Luke
not going to college?

06:14.320 --> 06:15.820
It's not over.

06:15.820 --> 06:17.020
Delete.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.460
What are you doing?
I'm driving up there

06:18.460 --> 06:19.860
to tell them
they made a mistake.

06:19.860 --> 06:21.290
They'd be lucky
to have a kid like Luke.

06:21.290 --> 06:23.160
Well, I guess it...
It can't hurt.

06:23.160 --> 06:25.500
I mean, it's not like
they can super reject him.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.230
Although, Michigan did use
that exact term.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.510
Man: <i> You're on Caliente 96.3 with
Diego and the donkey.</i> Hello! Yes!

06:35.510 --> 06:37.810
I'm calling about
the Gloria Estefan tickets.

06:37.810 --> 06:38.910
<i>And they're all yours</i>

06:38.910 --> 06:40.710
<i>if you can
complete this Lyric...</i>

06:40.710 --> 06:42.510
<i>"Turn the blank around."</i>
Mm...

06:42.520 --> 06:44.150
<i>One of her biggest hits
from the '90s.</i>

06:44.150 --> 06:45.550
<i>We've been playing it
all morning.</i>

06:45.550 --> 06:47.690
"Turn the car around."
<i>Nope. Two more guesses.</i>

06:47.690 --> 06:49.150
"Turn the boat around."

06:49.160 --> 06:50.590
<i>Try again.</i>

06:50.590 --> 06:51.990
"Turn the economy around"!

06:53.690 --> 06:55.330
<i>You're an ass.</i>

06:55.330 --> 06:56.730
Damn it!

06:58.200 --> 07:01.070
Wow. I just got
super accepted to Michigan.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.400
He's the second Delgado
to go to college.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.570
My cousin went to

07:04.570 --> 07:06.840
the best medical school
in Colombia.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.870
They would not just accept
any cadaver.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.940
Okay, mom, let's go.

07:09.940 --> 07:11.580
Oh, yeah, but wait.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.350
You remember when your head
was this tiny?

07:14.350 --> 07:16.710
Okay. Mom, mom,
I think I'm set for hats.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.080
Manny: I know when a female's
about to burst into tears.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.350
I've seen it enough times.

07:20.350 --> 07:21.750
I had to keep my mom away

07:21.750 --> 07:24.520
from anything that reminded her
I was moving away

07:24.520 --> 07:26.790
and keep myself away
from Williams Sonoma.

07:26.790 --> 07:27.960
I could lose an afternoon.

07:29.430 --> 07:31.460
A pet store.
These are fun.

07:31.460 --> 07:33.100
I think he misses his mommy.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.530
He'll forget about her
by the time we get to the car.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.700
On second thought,
let's catch a movie.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.970
They always help keep your mind
off of things.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.540
Oh.

07:42.770 --> 07:44.280
Wait, officer... no!

07:44.280 --> 07:46.410
My car is only here because
I was being responsible!

07:46.410 --> 07:48.110
I was babysitting my uncle Joe

07:48.110 --> 07:49.710
and got too drunk to drive home!

07:51.480 --> 07:53.580
What is this thing?!

07:53.590 --> 07:54.590
The barnacle.

07:54.590 --> 07:55.890
They stick it on your car

07:55.890 --> 07:57.660
when you have
unpaid parking tickets.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.090
I couldn't let my parents
see it,

07:59.090 --> 08:00.590
because I knew
they'd just overreact

08:00.590 --> 08:02.460
and lecture me about
being irresponsible,

08:02.460 --> 08:04.000
and I couldn't pay to remove it

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
because I just maxed out
my credit card

08:06.000 --> 08:08.070
on these insanely expensive
pair of sunglasses.

08:08.070 --> 08:09.830
I don't love 'em.

08:09.840 --> 08:12.840
Cameron: Okay.

08:12.840 --> 08:16.070
I just had to re-create
Lily's painting of pig Lily,

08:16.080 --> 08:17.780
and she'd be none the wiser.

08:17.780 --> 08:21.510
Oh, it's like painting
with sausages.

08:21.510 --> 08:24.920
Sorry, cam,
no pig painting by Lily here.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.650
I do have some random scribbles

08:26.650 --> 08:28.590
that Luke made when he was...

08:28.590 --> 08:30.290
Huh, that's a little later
than I'd hoped.

08:30.290 --> 08:31.820
Cameron: Fine.

08:31.820 --> 08:33.260
Not a word of this to Mitchell.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.289
I'm sure you're curious why.

08:34.289 --> 08:35.330
Wrong again.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.530
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

08:38.659 --> 08:40.200
Hi. You're the first one here.
Don't worry.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.330
We don't have
to make conversation.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.470
Ooh! A scrapbook!

08:42.470 --> 08:43.970
Aww, look at this.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.440
All of our
old school projects...

08:46.440 --> 08:48.370
Paintings by me and Claire.

08:48.370 --> 08:50.640
Aww! You're just a big softie,
aren't 'cha?

08:50.640 --> 08:53.210
My lawyer's secretary
put that together for my image

08:53.210 --> 08:54.550
at the divorce trial.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.780
There's the old bear.
Grr!

08:56.780 --> 08:58.550
Oh, this is from my
8th birthday.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.190
I made mom throw a party
with a whole farm theme.

09:01.190 --> 09:02.520
You know what?
I need this.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.990
Cam thinks I look down
on his farm life.

09:04.990 --> 09:07.160
This'll prove to him that... bup, bup, bup.
This comes with a price.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.030
You can get me
Gloria Estefan tickets, right?

09:09.030 --> 09:10.160
Dad, that is offensive.

09:10.160 --> 09:11.200
Not every gay person

09:11.200 --> 09:13.300
is connected to Gloria Estefan.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.030
But you are, right?

09:14.030 --> 09:16.030
It's complicated.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.540
Cam briefly dated a member

09:17.540 --> 09:20.070
of Gloria Estefan's band,
the Miami sound machine.

09:20.070 --> 09:21.840
He doesn't talk about it much.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.810
Just whenever someone
mentions her or Miami.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.640
Or humidity.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.150
Well...

09:28.150 --> 09:29.680
When I get the tickets,
you get the picture.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.220
Mean!

09:31.880 --> 09:33.220
Hey, hey!

09:33.220 --> 09:34.250
Um, how would you feel about

09:34.250 --> 09:35.750
asking cam
to use his connections

09:35.760 --> 09:37.560
to get two Gloria Estefan
tickets for tonight

09:37.560 --> 09:38.920
and then secretly
giving them to me?

09:38.930 --> 09:40.420
I'll do it,

09:40.430 --> 09:42.490
but I need you to help me
with my car first.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.830
I'd ask my parents, but...

09:43.830 --> 09:45.530
They wouldn't understand.
It's not your fault.

09:45.530 --> 09:47.600
Yeah. Okay. Let's go.
Mm-hmm.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.770
Are we sure this is
the best way to do this?

09:49.770 --> 09:51.570
All we have to do is

09:51.570 --> 09:52.900
make sure that
my parents don't see it

09:52.910 --> 09:53.940
by moving it down the street.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.070
Okay? Hold on.
I'm your eyes.

09:55.070 --> 09:56.370
Hug the curb.

09:56.380 --> 09:57.910
Haley, just...
All right. Straighten out.

09:57.910 --> 09:59.340
T-turn on your hazards.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.010
That's the windshield wiper!
Haley: You're on my leg! Move!

10:02.010 --> 10:04.250
Oh, god! I'm...

10:04.780 --> 10:06.180
Mitchell: All right.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.190
Let's just breathe,
let's take a moment...

10:08.190 --> 10:09.390
Can you just get off
my leg, please?

10:09.390 --> 10:10.590
I'm not... I'm s... I'm not...

10:10.590 --> 10:12.120
Are we going backwards?
You put us in reverse.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.620
Okay, hit the brake.

10:13.630 --> 10:15.130
That is the <i> gas!</i>

10:15.130 --> 10:16.960
How do you have a license?!

10:16.960 --> 10:18.700
I can't move! You're on my leg!

10:19.970 --> 10:22.970
Okay. Good first try.

10:24.770 --> 10:25.940
Can't believe you
didn't treat yourself

10:25.940 --> 10:27.200
to a bulldog blast.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.870
Isn't that basically
just sugar, ice,

10:28.880 --> 10:31.240
and the stuff they you use
to cover the blue man group?

10:31.240 --> 10:32.440
Hi. Hi.

10:32.450 --> 10:33.910
We're here to see the
Dean of admissions.

10:33.910 --> 10:35.480
We called. We're the Dunphys.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.980
Ah. I'll tell Dean
Hinden you're here.

10:36.980 --> 10:38.650
Um, eh... Hinden?

10:38.650 --> 10:40.220
Yes. Dean Rudolf Hinden.

10:42.090 --> 10:43.720
I have a bad feeling.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.890
Well, honey, you did just have
two of those antifreezes.

10:45.890 --> 10:47.220
No.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.160
Rudy Hinden... we
were classmates.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.630
Super annoying... always "on."

10:51.630 --> 10:54.100
We cheered together, we...
We tumbled together,

10:54.100 --> 10:55.230
we rolled around together,

10:55.230 --> 10:56.770
but we were never close.

10:56.770 --> 10:59.140
When I say "bull,"
you say "dog"!

10:59.140 --> 11:00.740
Bull! Dog!

11:00.740 --> 11:01.770
Bull! Dog!

11:01.770 --> 11:02.970
Hey, Rudy!

11:02.980 --> 11:04.410
This is my wife Claire.

11:04.410 --> 11:05.610
Hi. Pleasure.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.180
Nice to meet you. Wow.

11:07.180 --> 11:09.180
Well, please come on in.

11:09.180 --> 11:11.120
Oh! Great trampoline. Thanks.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.580
I like to bounce at
least 20 minutes a day.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.650
It's where I get my best ideas.
Okay.

11:15.660 --> 11:16.950
How quirky.

11:17.820 --> 11:18.990
Oh, hey, Phil,

11:18.990 --> 11:20.790
where were nationals
senior year?

11:20.790 --> 11:22.330
Cleveland, oh... hi-o!

11:22.330 --> 11:23.690
Can you imagine
putting up with this

11:23.700 --> 11:26.030
for years on end? It's hard.

11:26.030 --> 11:27.970
Tell you what, I'll give
it some bounce time

11:27.970 --> 11:29.530
and hit you back with an answer.

11:29.540 --> 11:31.170
Listen, you seem busy.

11:31.170 --> 11:32.540
I'll get straight to it.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.340
Our son Luke applied
and didn't get in,

11:34.340 --> 11:36.510
and I think it's
worth reconsidering.

11:36.510 --> 11:38.840
He's a great kid. He's
just a late bloomer.

11:38.850 --> 11:41.280
Okay. I think we can make
something happen for your boy.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.110
Really?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.880
Yeah, we've let in way
worse applicants than him.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.320
Rudy! Wha...

11:46.320 --> 11:49.120
Thank you! You're the b-e-s-t best!
Yeah.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.960
No problemo.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.660
I'll just, uh...

11:53.660 --> 11:54.990
Hey.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.490
While you're here,

11:56.500 --> 11:58.300
I've always wanted to
ask you something.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.300
You remember that magic
trick you used to do

12:00.300 --> 12:02.230
where you got out of a
straitjacket blindfolded?

12:02.240 --> 12:03.130
Barnum's humbug.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.470
Yeah. That one.

12:05.470 --> 12:06.540
How'd you do it?

12:06.540 --> 12:08.410
Magic. I-i feel like...

12:08.410 --> 12:09.570
No, no, no, really...

12:09.580 --> 12:11.310
I've been trying to
figure it out for years.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.180
Um, I'm sorry.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.910
It's... it's not customary

12:13.910 --> 12:16.080
for a magician to
reveal his secrets.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.550
It's also not "customary"
for a Dean of admissions

12:18.550 --> 12:20.720
to alter an applicant's
status, so...

12:22.550 --> 12:24.320
I'll go get the straitjacket
from the nurse.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.020
You're gonna do it, right?

12:27.030 --> 12:28.690
I don't know.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.230
Let me bounce on it.

12:32.530 --> 12:33.800
Phil.

12:36.670 --> 12:37.670
Claire: Sweetheart?

12:41.770 --> 12:43.040
Phil. Honey, Phil,
you can't possibly

12:43.040 --> 12:44.110
be struggling with
this decision.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.540
Do you know what
happens to magicians

12:45.540 --> 12:46.780
who reveal their
secrets, Claire?

12:46.780 --> 12:47.710
They're shunned.

12:47.710 --> 12:49.280
Doesn't that happen already?

12:49.280 --> 12:50.550
Listen, I possess knowledge

12:50.550 --> 12:52.450
passed down from the
ancient Egyptian conjurers

12:52.450 --> 12:54.250
to the prestidigitators
of the dark ages

12:54.250 --> 12:55.890
to the amateur
illusionists of today.

12:55.890 --> 12:57.390
I am worried about
another trick.

12:57.390 --> 12:59.290
I am trying to make
our son disappear

12:59.290 --> 13:01.690
to a barely accredited
four-year college.

13:01.690 --> 13:03.860
There he is. Okay, here we are.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.330
Why don't you go ahead
and put these on.

13:07.770 --> 13:09.630
No, no, no. In here.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.370
I want to make sure I get this.

13:11.370 --> 13:12.770
I want to see everything.

13:12.770 --> 13:14.610
Hm. Okay.

13:14.610 --> 13:15.610
Okay, I got it.

13:18.780 --> 13:21.080
I didn't quite grasp what
I was asking Phil to do,

13:21.080 --> 13:23.050
but, um...

13:23.050 --> 13:24.650
It got weird.

13:24.650 --> 13:26.450
Hinden: Okay.

13:26.450 --> 13:27.920
All right. Whenever
you're ready.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.890
Wait, Th-this isn't going
on the Internet, is it?

13:29.890 --> 13:30.920
No, it's just for me.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.920
The challenge with this escape

13:32.930 --> 13:36.090
is, uh, releasing the
shackles in the correct order

13:36.100 --> 13:38.460
baring yourself gradually.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.230
Okay, more upbeat. Do the patter.
What?

13:40.230 --> 13:42.070
I want to hear the old patter.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.130
Blindfold him.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.470
Take it. Yes... sir.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.010
Um...

13:50.010 --> 13:51.410
Phil.

13:51.410 --> 13:53.740
Honey, you don't
have to do this.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.810
Luke can join the army.

13:54.810 --> 13:56.110
It's okay.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.950
I may be locked up,
but my mind is free.

13:57.950 --> 13:59.120
Okay.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.190
Imagine yourself in a museum

14:01.190 --> 14:02.850
filled with the
world's oddities.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.320
No, no, no, no. Slow down.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.760
Enjoy it.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.660
And turn around

14:06.660 --> 14:08.360
so I can get a good
look at the back.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.530
Let me see the back.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.200
Behold the freak

14:14.200 --> 14:18.170
for all to see.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.270
Go get my tickets.

14:22.370 --> 14:23.470
Is my hair a mess?

14:23.480 --> 14:24.540
It's so humid out.

14:24.540 --> 14:26.010
You want to talk about humidity?

14:26.010 --> 14:27.380
I once spent a steamy weekend

14:27.380 --> 14:29.050
with a certain member of
the Miami sound machine.

14:29.050 --> 14:30.850
That's crazy!

14:30.850 --> 14:32.850
Do you know that they're
in town tonight? What?

14:32.850 --> 14:34.180
Can you get me two tickets?

14:34.190 --> 14:35.550
Oh, my god.

14:35.550 --> 14:37.120
These hands...

14:37.120 --> 14:39.190
They're so small and
delicate like a child.

14:39.190 --> 14:40.360
I know.

14:40.360 --> 14:42.630
This watch came from
an American girl doll.

14:42.630 --> 14:45.160
Are you gonna hook me up or what?
Yes, yes.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.360
Just as soon as you and
your tiny little hands

14:47.370 --> 14:48.670
re-create a painting for me.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.370
This way.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.240
What do you think?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.970
I was going for dark
and mysterious,

14:53.970 --> 14:55.410
but I'm afraid I
circled right back

14:55.410 --> 14:56.410
to cute and approachable.

14:58.010 --> 14:59.740
Oh, she's so lucky.

14:59.750 --> 15:03.180
He's always gonna
be her little boy.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.880
Mom, you're projecting
on these mannequins.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.420
For all we know, he's
a little person,

15:06.420 --> 15:08.350
and that's his wife
who's evolved enough

15:08.350 --> 15:10.020
to see how big he
is on the inside.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.320
Manny, I know what you've been

15:11.320 --> 15:12.720
trying to do the whole day.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.220
I am not about to
have a breakdown

15:14.230 --> 15:15.890
because you're going to college.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.060
I was awake last night when
you were brushing my hair.

15:18.060 --> 15:19.760
Okay, yes, it's going to be hard

15:19.770 --> 15:21.530
because you're
gonna be far away,

15:21.530 --> 15:23.930
so I'm not gonna get to
see you all the time.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.670
But we'll still
talk on the phone.

15:25.670 --> 15:26.700
Yeah, at the beginning,

15:26.710 --> 15:28.270
but then you're gonna get busy,

15:28.270 --> 15:29.710
and then I am going to get busy.

15:29.710 --> 15:31.110
Too busy to take my calls?

15:31.110 --> 15:33.080
I have made peace with it.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.750
Your childhood days are over.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.350
Justina: Guillermo,
come back here!

15:37.380 --> 15:38.380
What are you doing?

15:38.380 --> 15:39.850
Don't run away from your mother.

15:39.850 --> 15:42.420
Life is going to tear
you apart soon enough.

15:42.420 --> 15:44.520
I want to go on the
merry-go-round.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.590
Oh, you're on it.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.930
You've got 10 years
left with that woman.

15:47.930 --> 15:50.190
Cherish them. Cherish her.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.730
Thanks?

15:53.730 --> 15:56.030
I think maybe I'm freaking
out about going to school.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.400
I see that.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.400
But we're gonna be okay.

15:59.410 --> 16:02.040
Being apart is just gonna
make nights like tonight,

16:02.040 --> 16:03.910
going to a concert,
even more special.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.780
No! Guillermo!

16:05.780 --> 16:07.380
I don't want to!

16:07.380 --> 16:09.150
Okay, now it's just
bad parenting.

16:09.150 --> 16:10.780
This is excellent work.

16:10.780 --> 16:12.950
Excellent work. Really?

16:12.950 --> 16:14.890
I'm not used to hearing that.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.090
I get why people try now.

16:16.090 --> 16:17.050
Is that my painting?

16:17.060 --> 16:18.390
Why is it here?

16:18.390 --> 16:20.160
Um, oh, well, because
it was on loan

16:20.160 --> 16:21.730
to your grandma and grandpa

16:21.730 --> 16:23.930
just like they do with real art.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.000
Better than most of the
stuff in this house.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.760
Now get me those Gloria
Esteban tickets.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.430
It's Estefan.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.970
That's what I said.
I'm a huge fan.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.400
Okay.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.440
Carlos, Carlos.

16:34.440 --> 16:35.810
Hey... hey, Carlos.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.910
Um, this, uh, Cameron Tucker.

16:37.910 --> 16:39.140
I don't know if you
remember me or not.

16:39.150 --> 16:40.680
Oh, you... you do.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.010
Okay, hi.

16:42.010 --> 16:44.650
Yeah, wondering if I could
get a couple tickets

16:44.650 --> 16:46.850
for the show tonight.

16:46.850 --> 16:49.690
Gloria Estefan.

16:49.690 --> 16:52.720
Because you're in the Miami
sound machine, silly.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.590
What?

16:55.590 --> 16:58.660
It was loud in the bar
the night I met Carlos,

16:58.660 --> 17:01.300
and it turns out
he is not a member

17:01.300 --> 17:04.430
of the legendary band,
the Miami sound machine.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.300
He owns a mobile dog
grooming business

17:07.310 --> 17:10.839
called Miami's hound machine.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.040
In retrospect, I didn't
need to be as alarmed

17:13.050 --> 17:16.050
with his collection of
leashes and collars.

17:16.050 --> 17:17.880
Phil: Okay, everybody,
gather round.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.050
Luke has one more
college to hear from,

17:20.050 --> 17:21.349
and I got a good feeling
about this one.

17:21.349 --> 17:22.690
Yeah.

17:22.690 --> 17:24.190
Mom, can we not do this here?

17:24.190 --> 17:25.690
Oh, come on, have
a little faith.

17:25.690 --> 17:27.690
Okay, Cannon's ready.
And record.

17:27.690 --> 17:28.790
Record, got it.

17:28.790 --> 17:29.830
Any time, buddy.

17:29.830 --> 17:30.990
All right, everyone,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.360
get ready to tell me how
I'm my own kind of smart

17:33.370 --> 17:35.470
and how everyone takes
their own path.

17:35.470 --> 17:36.830
Wow.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.040
You're a different kind
of smart, and everyone...

17:39.040 --> 17:40.470
Jay: Kind of smart. Cameron:
Everybody takes their own path.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.840
I got in?

17:41.840 --> 17:43.570
What?! He got in!

17:47.180 --> 17:50.050
You got in! What is
wrong with this thing?

17:50.050 --> 17:52.180
Wait, this doesn't
make any sense.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.920
I got rejected by worse
schools than this.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.050
Why would they want me?

17:55.050 --> 17:56.490
Why wouldn't they want you?

17:56.490 --> 17:58.390
Honey, it's not
all about grades.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.020
I mean, you were involved in...
In...

18:00.030 --> 18:01.860
Yay!

18:01.860 --> 18:03.230
Did you talk to them?

18:03.230 --> 18:04.230
I'm sorry, what?

18:05.330 --> 18:06.400
Show me your tongue.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.100
I don't know what
that would prove.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.070
This kind of seems like an
embarrassing family moment. I'm on it.

18:12.070 --> 18:13.000
Blue!

18:13.010 --> 18:14.340
You can't go to that campus

18:14.340 --> 18:15.570
without getting a bulldog blast.

18:15.570 --> 18:17.170
We went up there to tell
them they made a mistake.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.710
They didn't make a mistake,

18:18.710 --> 18:20.110
and neither did the
other schools.

18:20.110 --> 18:21.250
I'm not going.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.910
Honey, it's your last chance.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.680
Then I'll wait until next year.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.080
If I go, I want to deserve it.
I can respect that.

18:27.090 --> 18:28.850
Nobody asked for your
opinion, thank you.

18:28.850 --> 18:30.290
You're going.

18:30.290 --> 18:31.420
You have no idea what
your father went through

18:31.420 --> 18:32.690
to get you this opportunity.

18:32.690 --> 18:36.190
He debased himself in
ways you can't imagine.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.730
You said it wasn't that bad.

18:37.730 --> 18:39.130
Gloria: What are you watching?

18:39.130 --> 18:40.700
Our neighbor sent me a video.

18:40.700 --> 18:42.130
It's of Haley and Mitchell.

18:42.130 --> 18:43.370
Oh. No, that's... okay,
we don't need to...

18:43.370 --> 18:44.940
Mitchell: <i>It's taking forever.</i>

18:44.940 --> 18:47.400
Haley: <i> I'm pushing as hard as I can.</i>
Whoa. Wait.

18:47.410 --> 18:49.570
You have one of those
things on your windshield?

18:49.580 --> 18:51.440
How many parking
tickets do you have?

18:51.440 --> 18:53.980
I think we're focused on
the wrong thing here.

18:53.980 --> 18:55.280
Luke's not going to college.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.280
Why is your finger pink?

18:57.620 --> 18:58.780
This isn't mine.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.250
I knew the perspective was off.

19:00.250 --> 19:01.220
It's cam's fault.

19:01.220 --> 19:02.890
He made me copy it from a photo.

19:02.890 --> 19:04.250
You know what?

19:04.260 --> 19:05.260
I accidentally destroyed
the original,

19:05.260 --> 19:06.720
and I couldn't live without it.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.630
Mitchell Pritchett,
parenting magazine.

19:08.630 --> 19:11.230
How is forging a child's
painting any less egregious

19:11.230 --> 19:12.600
than replacing a pig's ashes

19:12.600 --> 19:14.330
with Mrs. Pasternak's
dead husband?

19:14.330 --> 19:15.500
It's not.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.600
I'm a hypocrite. My
whole life is a lie.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.770
Carlos isn't really in
the Miami sound machine.

19:19.770 --> 19:21.610
He's just a... a
basic dog groomer.

19:21.610 --> 19:23.610
Save your money. I couldn't
get you your tickets.

19:23.610 --> 19:25.080
Claire: You're spending
money on tickets

19:25.080 --> 19:26.480
when you should be spending
money on ticket...

19:26.480 --> 19:27.740
You know what I mean.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.580
The concert tickets
were for Mitchell.

19:29.580 --> 19:31.680
So you didn't get my tickets?
No.

19:31.680 --> 19:33.520
So you didn't get <i>my</i> tickets.
The website was insane.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.790
You'd need the reflexes
of a mongoose.

19:35.790 --> 19:37.250
You lied to me.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.160
Well, look around!
Everybody's lying.

19:39.160 --> 19:40.790
Forging paintings,
driving blind,

19:40.790 --> 19:42.190
swapping ashes.

19:42.190 --> 19:43.960
I didn't want to
ruin the pig moon.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.660
There is no pig moon.

19:45.660 --> 19:48.630
How backwards do you think
grasshopper, Missouri is?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.600
Guys, guys. I've got this.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.970
Guys.

19:53.970 --> 19:55.370
I talked to judge Tager.

19:55.370 --> 19:57.310
He'll make your parking
tickets disappear

19:57.310 --> 19:59.810
in return for a
couple of Cubans.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.350
You took three.

20:01.350 --> 20:03.680
The other one is for the
security guard at the club.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.950
He moonlights where
Estefan's playing tonight.

20:05.950 --> 20:07.350
He'll meet you by
the stage door.

20:07.350 --> 20:10.390
Thank you for fixing Jay's lies.

20:10.390 --> 20:12.660
We all struggle with the truth.

20:12.660 --> 20:15.130
Like last Thursday when I
stalled Jay at the club

20:15.130 --> 20:16.790
so you could get Joe
out of the doggy door.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.960
She locked us out, and
the stove was on.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.400
And you two. You know a guy
at a club that can help us?

20:22.400 --> 20:24.370
No. Just talk more.

20:24.370 --> 20:26.300
90% of your problems
would be solved

20:26.310 --> 20:27.570
if you just discussed things.

20:27.570 --> 20:29.010
The Vanderkoff is a knock-off.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.470
I burnt a hole in the knock-off,

20:30.480 --> 20:31.980
and I had replaced
it with a real one.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.580
Okay, everything's settled here.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.610
I think the steaks are ready.
Let's go eat.

20:37.010 --> 20:38.320
Well, I guess our son

20:38.320 --> 20:40.350
isn't going to
college this year.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.550
I know, and I know we're supposed
to be worried about him.

20:42.550 --> 20:44.690
But do you see what he just did,

20:44.690 --> 20:47.390
how he solved everybody's
problems like that?

20:47.390 --> 20:50.060
It's pretty incredible, right?

20:50.060 --> 20:51.700
That's a Dunphy man, Claire...

20:51.700 --> 20:53.000
Resourceful, cool,

20:53.000 --> 20:54.830
and just the right
amount of <i> Savoir Faire.</i>

20:56.600 --> 20:58.440
I'll, uh... I'll see
you in the kitchen.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.280
So, this is a real Vanderkoff.
Yeah, yeah.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.910
It feels good to finally
be free of that secret.

21:07.910 --> 21:10.280
Yeah, it's just great to have
everything out in the open.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.550
Yeah.

21:12.550 --> 21:14.220
That expensive painting
you bought me over there,

21:14.220 --> 21:15.920
I moved it to cover up a
hole I made in the wall.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.090
I only paid 25 cents for that
painting at a garage sale,

21:18.090 --> 21:19.560
and I used
the rest of the money on shoes.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.690
I get electrolysis.
My beard grows up to here.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.060
I don't really know
how to line dance,

21:23.060 --> 21:24.390
and that's why
those cowboys laughed at you

21:24.400 --> 21:25.640
when you did what I taught you.

21:27.100 --> 21:28.460
That's not Larry.
That's not Larry.
