and rack up six figures in student loans

03:35.416 --> 03:36.750
to become a vigilante.

That is for billionaires and narcissists,

Since you saved the lives

the jury was then biased in your favor.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.333
Uh... Okay. Yeah.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.750
Pedro, Jen Walters is back, baby.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.000
(THUDS)

11:07.958 --> 11:09.458
Welcome, Miss Walters.

11:09.541 --> 11:11.666
We are thrilled to have you join the team.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.291
I'm so happy to be here.

11:14.083 --> 11:17.250
It is an exciting time at GLK and H.

11:17.333 --> 11:20.750
More and more eccentric superhumans
are coming out of the woodwork.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.875
We just started a Superhuman Law Division,

11:23.958 --> 11:27.541
and I want you, well, the She-Hulk,
to be the face of it.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.625
Oh.

11:28.708 --> 11:34.291
Uh, that means I'll expect you to be
at work and in court as the She-Hulk.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.083
Not as a normal person.

11:41.333 --> 11:42.875
-Right now?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:44.416 --> 11:47.458
-Um, well...
-Terrific.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.000
This way, please.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.500
We are the first top-tier law firm

11:56.583 --> 12:00.291
to launch an entire division
dedicated to superhuman law.

12:00.375 --> 12:02.416
Oh, my God. Is this why they hired me?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.708
Okay, this sucks.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.791
I am totally qualified, but now
everyone around here will always think

12:06.875 --> 12:09.416
this is the only reason
that I got the job. It's so unfair.

12:09.875 --> 12:13.958
I should be able to enjoy the fact that
I got an amazing new job, and I can't.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.916
(MEN LAUGHING)

12:16.083 --> 12:19.250
JENNIFER: These dodos never had to
deal with this on their first day at work.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.250
HOLLIWAY: But I'm curious...

12:21.333 --> 12:22.958
What do you you think about it?

12:23.708 --> 12:26.250
I'm, uh,

12:26.333 --> 12:28.583
a bit agnostic.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.250
HOLLIWAY: Interesting.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.875
Unprecedented, for sure.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.041
Huh. (CHUCKLES)

12:39.166 --> 12:41.958
I'll spend the rest of the year
worrying about what I just said.

12:42.041 --> 12:45.000
Ah, here we are. Your office.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.166
I'll leave you to settle in.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.750
Okay.

12:53.458 --> 12:55.500
Why are you in Hulk form? That is a look.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.333
I just found out,
the only reason they hired me

12:58.416 --> 13:01.541
is because they wanted a Hulk lawyer
in the Superhuman Law Division.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.875
Yes, but look at everything
it's getting us. Are you kidding?

13:04.958 --> 13:07.000
Big-ass windows, yes.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.583
A fully stocked mini fridge.

13:09.666 --> 13:11.625
And a desk.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.625
I mean, this is normal.
But this is a very fancy desk.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.416
I'll have to buy an entirely
new wardrobe just to come to work.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.750
Yeah. And you're making enough money
to do that now.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.458
-(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
-PUG: Knock-knock.

13:23.875 --> 13:27.208
Hi, there. I'm Pug. I'm also
in the Superhuman Law Division.

13:27.291 --> 13:28.958
Oh, I'm Jennifer Walters.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.833
I made you guys a welcome basket.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.250
-Oh!
-(GIGGLING)

13:32.333 --> 13:35.666
It's got some office supplies
to get you started. Snacks.

13:35.750 --> 13:38.791
And a map to
the best bathroom for pooping.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.625
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

13:42.541 --> 13:45.291
So, uh, let Carrington go,

13:45.375 --> 13:49.791
and then, um, tell Bob Thompson
that he's going to Minneapolis,

13:50.125 --> 13:52.250
because he hates the cold.
Just tell him that.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.541
Mr. Holliway, I'm so excited to be here.

13:54.625 --> 13:58.250
I can't wait to take on whatever case
you want to assign to me, but...

13:58.333 --> 14:01.000
Your first case
is the parole of Emil Blonsky.

14:02.666 --> 14:03.666
Oh.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.125
Also known as Abomination,

14:05.208 --> 14:08.875
Mr. Blonsky has been serving his sentence
in an ultra-high security prison...

14:08.958 --> 14:11.791
I'm very familiar with Mr. Blonsky, sir.

14:12.958 --> 14:17.041
So you know there's a lot of controversy
surrounding his possible release.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.708
This is extremely high profile.

14:19.791 --> 14:23.875
The publicity alone is worth
GLK and H taking this on pro bono.

14:23.958 --> 14:26.458
I'm sorry, but I can't represent him, sir.

14:26.541 --> 14:30.208
I have a serious conflict of interest.
This man tried to kill my cousin Bruce.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.750
Yeah, that's quite all right.

14:32.666 --> 14:35.583
Mr. Blonsky is well aware
of your familial connection

14:35.666 --> 14:38.166
and has signed a conflict waiver.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.875
He would like to retain you specifically
as his attorney.

14:42.791 --> 14:45.458
I have to say
I'm not comfortable taking this case.

14:45.541 --> 14:50.458
I would much prefer to be assigned
literally any other case at this firm.

14:51.750 --> 14:54.666
If you don't take the case,
then you don't have a job here.

14:57.291 --> 15:00.916
At the very least, you should
meet with the client before you decide.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.833
You can't come in like that.
No superpowers inside.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.083
(SIGHS)

15:29.416 --> 15:30.416
Oh!

15:31.916 --> 15:32.916
Walk through.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.708
When you enter
the visitor's safe area of the cell,

15:40.791 --> 15:42.916
do not step past the yellow line.

15:43.166 --> 15:46.875
Do not touch the glass separating
you and the prisoner, Abomination.

15:46.958 --> 15:50.958
Although we have taken every precaution,
we cannot guarantee your safety.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.625
-Do you accept these conditions?
-Yes.

15:54.791 --> 15:56.000
Sign here.

15:58.375 --> 16:02.041
In the event of injury or death,
please indicate who we should notify.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.583
It's that bad, huh?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.083
Never let your guard down.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.750
The prisoner is a very dangerous man.

16:08.833 --> 16:12.250
Is he gonna serve me up with
some fava beans and then a nice chian...

16:12.333 --> 16:13.916
Ma'am, this is a prison.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.416
-Of course.
-(DOOR BEEPS AND OPENS)

16:41.791 --> 16:43.166
Jennifer Walters.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.375
Well,

16:46.375 --> 16:49.041
first off, namaste.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.083
Mr. Blonsky, I was expecting...

16:52.166 --> 16:53.875
-Abomination, right?
-Yes.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.041
-Yeah, well...
-(ALARM BLARING)

16:55.125 --> 16:56.458
-Oh, God.
-(EMIL CHORTLING)

16:56.541 --> 16:57.958
-Sorry about that.
-No, I'm cool.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.166
No, you won't be seeing much of him about.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.333
Honestly, I've completely
transformed myself,

17:04.041 --> 17:06.875
you know, physically, obviously,

17:06.958 --> 17:09.250
but also spiritually.

17:09.333 --> 17:13.125
Does that mean that you can't turn into
the Abomination anymore, or you won't?

17:13.208 --> 17:17.125
No, no, it means that I choose not to.

17:17.208 --> 17:18.791
I'm simply Emil now.

17:18.875 --> 17:21.125
Russian born, British raised,

17:21.208 --> 17:23.166
Royal Marines commando,

17:23.250 --> 17:25.333
on loan to the US government.

17:25.500 --> 17:26.500
Okay.

17:26.583 --> 17:30.458
With seven soulmates that I met
through the prison pen pal program

17:30.541 --> 17:32.541
that I want to start a new life with.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.000
-Wow.
-So,

17:35.083 --> 17:37.666
let's talk about the elephant in the room,
shall we?

17:39.666 --> 17:41.000
Your cousin.

17:42.708 --> 17:44.875
-The Hulk.
-My cousin, Bruce.

17:44.958 --> 17:48.250
Semantics. He was the Hulk, wasn't he?

17:48.333 --> 17:51.041
You know, I tried to kill him, you know.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.791
So let's get that out of the way.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.083
It wasn't personal or anything. So...

17:56.083 --> 17:59.333
I was under direct orders
from your government.

17:59.416 --> 18:03.166
But then you went on
a destructive rampage in Harlem.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.041
That wasn't sanctioned by the government.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.500
Yeah, because they pumped me
full of that Super Soldier Serum.

18:09.958 --> 18:13.250
The serum the government gave you
caused your subsequent actions?

18:13.333 --> 18:17.166
I was a highly decorated soldier.

18:17.250 --> 18:22.333
You know, I was sent on a mission
to take out a threat,

18:22.416 --> 18:26.625
and I thought I was the good guy,
you know?

18:27.083 --> 18:29.291
I thought I was gonna be, you know...

18:30.833 --> 18:33.958
Captain bloody America or something,
you know?

18:34.041 --> 18:38.625
And now, that very threat, your cousin,

18:38.708 --> 18:43.208
is held up as some kind of hero,
and I'm locked up in here.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.166
Where's the justice in that, Jen?

18:48.625 --> 18:50.208
I understand your point.

18:50.291 --> 18:54.083
But the parole board's gonna need to know
that you feel remorse for your actions

18:54.166 --> 18:55.583
to even consider release.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.875
Absolutely, I do, you see.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.125
And I have here,

19:00.708 --> 19:04.041
-uh, various haikus I've written...
-Oh, boy.

19:04.125 --> 19:06.125
...to each of my victims

19:06.208 --> 19:08.916
expressing the sorrow.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.708
-You don't...
-If you'd like to experience them.

19:10.791 --> 19:12.208
That's okay, I get...

19:12.291 --> 19:14.708
"My tiny ears hear, so..."

19:14.791 --> 19:17.833
If I were your attorney,
I would advise you to

19:17.916 --> 19:19.541
speak truthfully, from the heart,

19:19.625 --> 19:22.375
instead of trying to gauge
what you think they might wanna hear.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.958
That's all from the heart, Jen.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.250
Look, I just wanna

19:29.583 --> 19:30.875
move on with my life,

19:31.166 --> 19:35.708
live in peace on a large piece of property
purchased for me by my seven soulmates.

19:35.791 --> 19:36.916
Right.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.250
Think you can help?

19:41.125 --> 19:42.666
Yeah, I'll think about it.

20:09.375 --> 20:13.333
Bruce, hey. Um, listen, I got a new job.

20:13.416 --> 20:16.583
Hey, congratulations. That's fantastic.

20:16.666 --> 20:18.083
JENNIFER: Yeah. But,

20:18.166 --> 20:22.458
part of the deal is, I have to
take on Emil Blonsky as a client.

20:22.541 --> 20:25.291
And I couldn't do that
without talking to you first.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.625
-Okay...
-It doesn't seem like you hold a grudge,

20:27.708 --> 20:30.125
at least you've never
talked about that before.

20:30.208 --> 20:31.875
-That's...
-And you're always saying that

20:31.958 --> 20:34.041
you know, everybody deserves
a second chance.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.416
-I think you've...
-And I'm not falling for an act here,

20:36.500 --> 20:39.583
but Blonsky did seem to have
really good arguments, you know?

20:39.666 --> 20:41.291
-Yeah...
-He was so compelling.

20:41.375 --> 20:44.250
And maybe I wanna believe
that he's reformed, you know?

20:44.333 --> 20:47.708
Isn't rehabilitation something we should
strive for as a society?

20:47.791 --> 20:49.458
-That's...
-But none of that matters

20:49.541 --> 20:51.750
-if you don't feel comfortable with it.
-Jen.

20:51.833 --> 20:54.125
You're calling me to tell me
you're taking the job.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.666
I'm calling you to tell you
I'm taking the job, yes.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.708
That's great, Jen, you should.

20:58.791 --> 21:02.125
Actually, Blonsky wrote me
a really nice letter a while back,

21:02.208 --> 21:05.583
and a really heartfelt haiku.
So we put everything behind us.

21:05.666 --> 21:09.708
That fight was so many years ago,
I'm a completely different person now.

21:09.791 --> 21:10.791

24:45.916 --> 24:47.458
But you still need it.

24:47.541 --> 24:49.916
I don't know
what I'm doing down here, I'll be honest.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.708
I've turned it left, turned it right.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.666
-Counterclockwise.
-The wheel just turns.

24:53.750 --> 24:55.083
I don't know what we're doing.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.750
-Okay, drop it down. There. Good.
-Okay.

24:57.833 --> 25:00.708
-Do not touch these wires again.
-No.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.708
I could've done that.

25:02.791 --> 25:04.541
There you go.
Yeah, watch out for the lamp.

25:04.625 --> 25:07.250
Yeah? Good, good. Come on up.
Come on. There you go.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.125
JENNIFER: I'm glad
you're staying hydrated, Dad,

25:09.208 --> 25:10.500
but this is a bit excessive.

25:10.583 --> 25:13.291
Oh! Here, I got that. Let me get that.
Yeah. Okay.
