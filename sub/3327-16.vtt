WEBVTT

00:03.977 --> 00:05.546
Sherlock, you home?

00:12.826 --> 00:15.928
I think we need a new bulb
in the foyer.

00:16.829 --> 00:18.214
Tell me where
Holmes is,

00:18.216 --> 00:19.715
and I'll let
you live.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.636
You looking for this?

00:25.021 --> 00:27.940
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

00:27.942 --> 00:30.526
Where is Holmes?

00:34.781 --> 00:36.181
That's pathetic.

00:38.034 --> 00:39.285
Sherlock?

00:44.242 --> 00:45.791
Now you hit me.
Seriously?

00:45.793 --> 00:47.326
What is your damage?

00:47.328 --> 00:48.744
Look, given that you
were held at gunpoint

00:48.746 --> 00:50.329
in this very room
little over a week ago,

00:50.331 --> 00:52.081
I thought, perhaps,
a test of your

00:52.083 --> 00:53.666
ability to defend yourself
was in order.

00:53.668 --> 00:55.367
It was.

00:55.369 --> 00:57.469
You have much to learn about
the art of self-preservation.

00:57.471 --> 00:59.555
Okay, if you ever
do that again, I swear...

00:59.557 --> 01:01.507
You'll what?
Fall over again?

01:01.509 --> 01:03.142
Look, the work I do
is dangerous.

01:03.144 --> 01:04.343
You know this,

01:04.345 --> 01:05.761
yet you insist
on accompanying me

01:05.763 --> 01:07.346
virtually everywhere I go.

01:07.348 --> 01:09.014
Last week, a violent criminal

01:09.016 --> 01:11.233
infiltrated this brownstone
while I wasn't here.

01:11.235 --> 01:13.719
Hmm? How?
You opened the door for him.

01:13.721 --> 01:15.053
He was a federal agent.

01:15.055 --> 01:17.406
Right, they never
do anything wrong, hmm?

01:17.408 --> 01:18.908
Realizing that you
were in physical danger

01:18.910 --> 01:19.992
was difficult for me.

01:19.994 --> 01:21.277
If anything ever
happened to you,

01:21.279 --> 01:23.112
I'm not sure
I could forgive myself.

01:23.114 --> 01:24.530
Okay, this is not
how you express concern

01:24.532 --> 01:26.064
for someone
that you want to keep safe.

01:26.066 --> 01:27.249
Quite right,
so I've reached out

01:27.251 --> 01:28.584
to a handful
of martial artists

01:28.586 --> 01:30.286
who reside in the city,
each one of them

01:30.288 --> 01:31.954
an expert in his
or her fighting style.

01:31.956 --> 01:33.405
My hope is some
combination of them

01:33.407 --> 01:34.590
will agree to train you.

01:34.592 --> 01:36.342
In the meantime,
you should expect

01:36.344 --> 01:38.711
more guerilla-style tests
of your ability

01:38.713 --> 01:40.713
to fight back.

01:42.048 --> 01:43.966
You have been warned.

01:43.968 --> 01:45.467
<i>This is Captain Gregson.</i>

01:45.469 --> 01:47.186
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:47.188 --> 01:49.021
<i>Hey, Captain, it's Bell.</i>

01:49.023 --> 01:50.272
Uh, sorry to call so late,

01:50.274 --> 01:51.923
but I thought you
would want to know

01:51.925 --> 01:53.442
the Rodriguez thing
is taken care of.

01:53.444 --> 01:56.695
He finally copped
to that holdup in Queens.

01:56.697 --> 01:59.031
I'm headed home now.

01:59.033 --> 02:01.367
I'll bring you up to speed
in the morning.

03:03.523 --> 03:05.617
We're still waiting
for ballistics to come back,

03:05.642 --> 03:07.249
but inital indications are

03:07.344 --> 03:10.805
that this was done
with a semiautomatic MP5.

03:10.925 --> 03:12.708
The MP5 meets
all the requirements

03:12.710 --> 03:15.044
for a good,
old-fashioned drive-by.

03:15.046 --> 03:17.379
It can be held with
one hand by a lone driver,

03:17.381 --> 03:18.714
it has
a large magazine,

03:18.716 --> 03:21.216
and in the hands
of a marksman,

03:21.218 --> 03:23.352
it's quite accurate
at close range.

03:23.354 --> 03:25.387
You, sir, were not
assailed by a marksman.

03:25.389 --> 03:27.890
Well, thank God for bad aim.

03:27.892 --> 03:29.224
And air bags.

03:29.226 --> 03:31.360
Yep, I can tell from
the pattern of the holes

03:31.362 --> 03:33.896
that the bullets were fired
in three-round bursts

03:33.898 --> 03:36.949
from a rifle barrel
as opposed to a smoothbore,

03:36.951 --> 03:39.068
which suggests that
whoever's behind the attack

03:39.070 --> 03:42.371
has access to high-level
firearm augmentation.

03:42.373 --> 03:44.156
Even if the location
of the holes

03:44.158 --> 03:46.575
reveals him
to have terrible aim.

03:46.577 --> 03:48.160
You really shouldn't
have jerked your wheel.

03:48.162 --> 03:49.828
You would've come out
without a scratch.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.213
Now you tell me.

03:51.215 --> 03:53.031
It's funny, Detective--
the second I heard

03:53.033 --> 03:56.532
about the attempt on your life,
I dove into your case history.

03:56.657 --> 03:59.057
I thought it would be
only a matter of time

03:59.059 --> 04:00.359
before the culprit's identity
presented itself.

04:00.361 --> 04:01.777
I was wrong.

04:01.779 --> 04:03.446
You've done excellent work
over the years.

04:03.448 --> 04:05.131
Made a lot of enemies.
There's no shortage

04:05.133 --> 04:06.749
of people who would like
to see you dead.

04:06.751 --> 04:08.451
You say it like
it's a good thing.

04:08.453 --> 04:09.952
Well, there is,
in my humble opinion,

04:09.954 --> 04:12.621
no greater compliment
an investigator can receive.

04:12.623 --> 04:14.740
Speaks to the quality
of your work.

04:14.742 --> 04:17.375
Well, do you think we should
dive back into the files

04:17.378 --> 04:19.577
and get more specific
about who was trying

04:19.579 --> 04:21.579
to compliment Detective Bell
last night?

04:21.582 --> 04:23.432
Uh, no need,
actually.

04:23.434 --> 04:25.968
I know exactly who did this.

04:27.270 --> 04:28.771
Curtis Bradshaw.

04:28.773 --> 04:30.639
Old-school gangster

04:30.641 --> 04:31.857
and all-around
scumbag.

04:31.859 --> 04:33.309
He was the target
of a detail

04:33.311 --> 04:34.610
I was assigned to
in '09,

04:34.612 --> 04:36.061
back when I was
still a uni.

04:36.063 --> 04:37.893
Aspiring drug kingpin, I see.

04:37.894 --> 04:38.974
At the height
of his power,

04:38.975 --> 04:40.975
he was selling product
all over the city.

04:40.977 --> 04:43.828
Had a crew of almost 100,
and they were moving in

04:43.830 --> 04:45.864
on other gangs' territories,
so it was getting bloody.

04:45.865 --> 04:47.564
Hence the detail.

04:47.566 --> 04:49.516
Says here he was suspected
of crimes

04:49.518 --> 04:51.318
ranging from racketeering
to torture

04:51.320 --> 04:52.736
and murder.

04:52.738 --> 04:54.404
Yet he was arrested in 2011

04:54.406 --> 04:57.241
on the mere charge
of possessing stolen property.

04:57.243 --> 04:59.243
Sentence to three years,
just served 18 months.

04:59.779 --> 05:03.947
Bradshaw was smarter
than your average street thug.

05:03.949 --> 05:05.499
He always flew
under the radar;

05:05.501 --> 05:07.067
kept just enough
distance between himself

05:07.069 --> 05:09.086
and the crimes that were
being committed by his crew.

05:09.088 --> 05:11.955
One of the detectives
on the detail...

05:11.957 --> 05:13.874
well, he got frustrated.

05:13.876 --> 05:15.408
Stole some heroin
from the evidence room

05:15.410 --> 05:17.344
and planted it
in Bradshaw's home.

05:17.346 --> 05:19.129
Well, Bradshaw
was arrested,

05:19.131 --> 05:20.914
but then, a few days later,

05:20.916 --> 05:22.749
someone called
with an anonymous tip,

05:22.751 --> 05:24.184
told I.A. what happened.

05:24.186 --> 05:26.804
We had no choice
but to cut Bradshaw loose.

05:26.806 --> 05:28.605
Now, I continued
to work the detail,

05:28.607 --> 05:29.807
went undercover
for a while,

05:29.809 --> 05:31.775
got to know his crew
inside and out.

05:31.777 --> 05:34.228
Still couldn't find
enough evidence to connect him

05:34.230 --> 05:35.979
to the drugs
they were trafficking, so...

05:35.981 --> 05:37.815
So you "Caponed" him.

05:37.817 --> 05:38.949
You arrested him

05:38.951 --> 05:40.200
on a less
significant charge

05:40.202 --> 05:41.869
just to get him off the street.

05:41.871 --> 05:43.987
While he was gone, we continued
to chip away at his empire.

05:43.989 --> 05:45.489
I went after his lieutenants--

05:45.491 --> 05:47.708
they weren't nearly
as careful as Bradshaw was--

05:47.710 --> 05:50.110
and I managed to put
most of them away.

05:50.112 --> 05:51.462
Six months into
his sentence,

05:51.464 --> 05:53.613
all he had left
were a few corners.

05:53.615 --> 05:55.782
Obviously you did a lot
of damage, but how can you

05:55.784 --> 05:57.751
be sure it's the same shooter
from last night?

05:59.420 --> 06:01.638
This was Bradshaw's baby.

06:01.640 --> 06:04.007
It's also the car
that pulled up alongside me.

06:04.009 --> 06:05.592
Now, he told me before his trial

06:05.594 --> 06:07.811
he was going to come
after me himself.

06:07.813 --> 06:09.513
And last night,
he finally did.

06:09.515 --> 06:11.181
Obviously, I can't
have Bell here

06:11.183 --> 06:12.649
investigating
his own attempted murder.

06:12.651 --> 06:14.902
And since we just put eyes
on Bradshaw,

06:14.904 --> 06:16.487
I thought maybe you could

06:16.489 --> 06:18.021
come with me
to question him?

06:18.023 --> 06:19.306
I suppose I could
lend my services.

06:19.308 --> 06:21.742
Thanks for not making me beg.

06:24.946 --> 06:27.364
Hey, you got a message
at the intake desk.

06:27.366 --> 06:28.815
We were on our way up,

06:28.817 --> 06:30.367
said we'd pass it along.

06:30.369 --> 06:32.836
What kind of a name
is Mr. Cheese?

06:32.838 --> 06:35.706
He's, uh, one of
my CIs; he's shy.

06:35.708 --> 06:37.374
What about last night?

06:37.376 --> 06:38.842
Yeah, it was just...

06:38.844 --> 06:40.294
Car took the worst of it.

06:40.296 --> 06:42.162
I'm glad you're doing okay.

06:44.215 --> 06:46.216
How many times
did you and her have sex?

06:46.218 --> 06:47.351
God.

06:47.353 --> 06:49.052
My over/under is ten.

06:49.054 --> 06:50.971
Officer Reyes
is an old friend.

06:50.973 --> 06:52.973
Her partner doesn't
like you very much.

06:52.975 --> 06:54.391
It's probably because
he'd like to have sex

06:54.393 --> 06:56.176
with her as well--
and when I say "as well".

06:56.178 --> 06:57.561
I mean in addition to
and separate from,

06:57.563 --> 06:59.947
not including you
as a third party.

06:59.949 --> 07:01.899
I know what you meant.

07:01.901 --> 07:03.483
She boxes.

07:03.485 --> 07:05.452
I can tell from her knuckles
and the tape residue.

07:05.454 --> 07:06.954
Perhaps she would agree
to spar with you,

07:06.956 --> 07:08.956
give me an idea of, uh,
what you might be like

07:08.958 --> 07:10.490
with an opponent
in your similar weight class.

07:10.492 --> 07:12.409
You sure this sudden
new interest in my safety

07:12.411 --> 07:14.161
has nothing to do
with watching two women

07:14.163 --> 07:15.495
engage in some foxy boxing?

07:15.497 --> 07:16.880
You think you're foxy?

07:16.882 --> 07:18.365
You two ready?

07:19.334 --> 07:20.867
<i>50 on my kid right here.</i>

07:20.869 --> 07:23.203
- Aah!
- That's all day.

07:23.205 --> 07:24.537
Let's play some "D,"
let's play some defense.

07:24.539 --> 07:25.672
Yeah, let's go,
let's go.

07:25.674 --> 07:27.307
Guys, come on,
you got to play some "D."

07:27.309 --> 07:28.842
Curtis Bradshaw.

07:28.844 --> 07:31.228
Captain Gregson, NYPD.

07:31.230 --> 07:33.880
These are my associates,
Holmes and Watson.

07:33.882 --> 07:35.599
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

07:35.601 --> 07:37.684
You're blocking my view.

07:37.686 --> 07:39.519
Oh, yeah?

07:39.521 --> 07:41.721
Imagine what the view's gonna
look like from the precinct.

07:41.723 --> 07:43.774
Can you account for
your whereabouts

07:43.776 --> 07:45.943
between the hours of 10:00
and 10:30 last night?

07:45.945 --> 07:47.560
Why would I need to?

07:47.562 --> 07:48.895
'Cause someone
took a few shots

07:48.897 --> 07:50.831
at an old friend
of yours.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.399
Detective Marcus Bell.

07:52.401 --> 07:56.119
You know, I heard something
about that on the news.

07:56.121 --> 07:59.456
Somebody fired a whole clip
into his car and didn't hit him.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.291
See, the thing
with him is,

08:01.293 --> 08:03.210
you got to aim low.

08:04.546 --> 08:05.796
Your car was seen

08:05.798 --> 08:07.914
leaving the scene
of the crime.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.800
You're going to have to be
more specific.

08:09.802 --> 08:11.018
I have a few.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.186
1968 blue
Chevy Biscayne.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.771
Get out of here.

08:14.773 --> 08:16.690
That car was stolen
two nights ago.

08:16.692 --> 08:19.226
Did you report the car stolen?
Hey, you know what?

08:19.228 --> 08:22.112
As a matter of fact,
I was going to do that today.

08:22.114 --> 08:24.781
I'm going to ask you one
more time, Mr. Bradshaw:

08:24.783 --> 08:27.150
Can you account for your
whereabouts or can't you?

08:27.152 --> 08:29.303
Yo, he was with me, man.

08:29.305 --> 08:30.621
We went to the movies.

08:30.623 --> 08:32.039
We didn't leave
till after midnight.

08:32.041 --> 08:33.123
No, man, you're wrong.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.491
He was with me last night.

08:34.493 --> 08:36.793
He was playing cards
at my cousin's place.

08:36.794 --> 08:39.996
You pick the alibi
you like the best.

08:39.999 --> 08:42.666
You a gambling man,
Mr. Bradshaw?

08:42.668 --> 08:45.618
I've been known to make
the occasional wager, but...

08:45.620 --> 08:48.088
I bet you I can put that ball
in that hoop from here.

08:49.975 --> 08:53.093
If I win, tell us where you
abandoned the car last night.

08:53.095 --> 08:54.794
You win, tell us nothing.

08:54.796 --> 08:57.981
British globetrotter here.

08:57.983 --> 09:01.301
Do you agree to the
terms of the bet or not?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.271
What you got, homey?

09:05.606 --> 09:07.807
What you got?
What you got?

09:09.110 --> 09:11.528
Look at this guy.
He's a clown.

09:11.530 --> 09:13.146
Look at this guy.

09:15.483 --> 09:16.867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:16.869 --> 09:19.336
He wasn't going to tell us
anything anyway.

09:19.338 --> 09:21.321
You gonna get
that ball, right?

09:28.846 --> 09:31.014
Marcus "Bulletproof" Bell.

09:31.016 --> 09:33.550
I take it you heard
about what happened last night.

09:33.552 --> 09:34.801
No thanks to you.

09:34.803 --> 09:37.137
I had to hear about it
on the news.

09:38.556 --> 09:41.441
So I hit you up
at the station.

09:41.443 --> 09:43.560
I wanted to make sure
you was okay.

09:43.562 --> 09:45.612
Now, I know you don't like
me calling you there,

09:45.614 --> 09:46.780
so I used a code name.

09:46.782 --> 09:47.898
Well, your old
gang name

09:47.900 --> 09:49.950
is not a code name.

09:52.036 --> 09:54.738
So, this guy, the shooter...

09:54.740 --> 09:56.156
what'd he come at you with?

09:56.158 --> 09:59.326
Modified MP5.

10:01.879 --> 10:04.030
You know, um,
I still know some people.

10:04.032 --> 10:05.749
I could ask around,
see who's strapped

10:05.751 --> 10:07.334
with that kind of hardware.

10:07.336 --> 10:09.836
Not without violating
your parole, you can't.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.757
Uh, these are for you.

10:13.759 --> 10:16.176
It's just a few things
to tide you over.

10:20.047 --> 10:21.431
Appreciate it.

10:21.433 --> 10:24.384
Been pretty sick
of the unsold burgers

10:24.386 --> 10:26.486
they let me take home
from work every night.

10:26.488 --> 10:28.188
Hoping to see
my PO next week,

10:28.190 --> 10:30.557
see if he can hook me up
with a better job.

10:30.559 --> 10:32.993
Hey.

10:32.995 --> 10:34.611
You're not him,
by the way.

10:34.613 --> 10:37.030
My parole officer.

10:37.032 --> 10:38.281
You don't have to case my place

10:38.283 --> 10:39.899
to see if I've been
up to anything.

10:39.901 --> 10:41.234
I'm not casing
anything, Andre.

10:41.236 --> 10:43.086
What, you think
I'm stupid, Marcus?

10:43.088 --> 10:45.738
You've only been
out a few weeks.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.424
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.209
You don't got to look out
for me, okay?

10:49.211 --> 10:50.343
I look out for you.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.461
I'm the big brother here.

10:51.463 --> 10:53.713
Andre...
I'm serious, Marcus.

10:53.715 --> 10:56.383
I know you're embarrassed.

10:56.385 --> 10:59.219
A cop with an ex-con
in the family.

11:00.304 --> 11:02.189
But it is what it is.

11:03.691 --> 11:05.792
When Detective Bell
said that Curtis Bradshaw

11:05.794 --> 11:07.527
was smarter
than the average thug,

11:07.529 --> 11:09.529
he was putting it mildly.

11:09.531 --> 11:11.264
He never came within 1,000 yards

11:11.266 --> 11:13.099
of the drugs
he was distributing.

11:13.101 --> 11:15.168
He allowed a small cadre
of trusted lieutenants

11:15.170 --> 11:17.487
to oversee almost
every transaction.

11:17.489 --> 11:20.740
I'm beginning to see why
the detective on his detail

11:20.742 --> 11:22.626
felt compelled to plant
evidence in his home.

11:22.628 --> 11:24.211
Mickey Hudson, right?

11:24.213 --> 11:26.279
Most of these are his notes.

11:26.281 --> 11:28.915
I was thinking he might be
a good person to talk to.

11:28.917 --> 11:30.167
Yes, he might be.

11:30.169 --> 11:32.285
If he wasn't so very dead.

11:32.287 --> 11:34.638
Hudson was brought up
on charges in 2009,

11:34.640 --> 11:37.507
committed suicide just
before the trial began.

11:37.509 --> 11:39.259
Don't you think it's weird
that Bradshaw

11:39.261 --> 11:40.727
went after Bell himself?

11:40.729 --> 11:42.929
I mean, he doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

11:42.931 --> 11:46.016
So, why not farm out the hit
to one of his lieutenants?

11:46.018 --> 11:48.568
His grudge with Bell is
very clearly personal.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.520
Nothing makes a
smart man stupid

11:50.522 --> 11:52.355
like a thirst
for vengeance.

11:52.357 --> 11:55.408
As you well know,
I speak from experience.

11:58.529 --> 12:01.281
I appreciate your help
with these files, by the way.

12:01.283 --> 12:03.316
No, Bell is family
at this point.

12:03.318 --> 12:06.503
Well, he's
an excellent resource.

12:06.505 --> 12:09.256
He's come to appreciate
the efficacy of my methods,

12:09.258 --> 12:11.291
and he shares sensitive
information when needed.

12:11.293 --> 12:13.210
Yeah. If he's murdered,

12:13.212 --> 12:16.213
I'll have to start over
with another detective.

12:16.215 --> 12:19.132
Well, I'm going to order
some Thai.

12:19.134 --> 12:21.801
Do you want anything?

12:24.004 --> 12:25.522
Ow!

12:25.524 --> 12:27.858
What the hell was that about?!
Don't be cross.

12:27.860 --> 12:29.359
It could've been a knife.

12:29.361 --> 12:31.361
I told you to expect more
tests of your reflexes

12:31.363 --> 12:33.146
while I await word from
potential trainers.

12:33.148 --> 12:35.031
Because you're afraid
I might get hurt. I remember.

12:35.033 --> 12:36.449
In case you haven't noticed,

12:36.451 --> 12:38.618
the only person
who has been hurting me is you.

12:38.620 --> 12:39.903
You're angry.
That's good.

12:39.905 --> 12:41.688
Come on, come at me.
Come on. Come on!

12:41.690 --> 12:43.573
These locks... you put them
in some special order

12:43.575 --> 12:44.991
the other day, right?

12:44.993 --> 12:47.360
They're arranged in
country of origin.

12:52.550 --> 12:55.135
Do it again.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.425
Excuse me, sir?

13:02.427 --> 13:05.445
Sir, you can't sit there.

13:07.315 --> 13:09.816
Sir!

13:10.935 --> 13:12.686
Fine, have it your way.

13:12.688 --> 13:14.437
I'm calling the police.

13:51.504 --> 13:52.971
It's Paula, correct?

13:52.973 --> 13:54.422
Officer Reyes.
Oh.

13:54.424 --> 13:56.091
You, you're
the consultant, right?

13:56.093 --> 13:57.292
Yep.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.593
We have a mutual friend.

13:58.595 --> 13:59.961
Detective Bell.

13:59.963 --> 14:01.829
Although I've never
seen him naked.

14:01.831 --> 14:03.631
Hey. Little respect.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.884
I was wondering if you might
tell me where you box.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.503
I'm looking for a gym
for my associate, Ms. Watson.

14:08.505 --> 14:10.271
How did you
know I boxed?

14:10.273 --> 14:12.307
No more talking.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.476
Not now.

14:22.218 --> 14:24.035
Captain.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.653
If you're thinking
about pulling a rabbit

14:25.655 --> 14:27.522
out of the hat,
get to it, would you?

14:27.524 --> 14:30.658
Media's already working
a "killer cops" angle.

14:30.660 --> 14:31.860
They think this is retribution

14:31.861 --> 14:33.495
for the attack
on Detective Bell.

14:33.497 --> 14:34.662
Ridiculous.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.047
Astute, actually.

14:36.049 --> 14:37.332
You think a cop did this?

14:37.334 --> 14:38.866
I'm afraid I found evidence

14:38.868 --> 14:43.037
that would suggest
that Detective Bell did this.

14:43.039 --> 14:44.973
It's a boot print.

14:44.975 --> 14:46.374
So what?

14:46.376 --> 14:47.759
It's a size ten.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.344
Pergotti.

14:49.346 --> 14:51.513
I know I'm a detective, Holmes,

14:51.515 --> 14:53.098
but part of a boot print

14:53.100 --> 14:54.849
doesn't really tell me
a whole story.

14:54.851 --> 14:57.185
I found this print
precisely where the killer

14:57.187 --> 14:58.903
was standing when they
shot Curtis Bradshaw.

14:58.905 --> 15:00.855
Then I remembered your
dark gray summer suit

15:00.857 --> 15:02.240
you favored in September.

15:02.242 --> 15:04.776
Always paired with
your brown Pergottis.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.495
You are a size ten,
aren't you?

15:08.314 --> 15:10.031
Captain.

15:10.033 --> 15:12.000
I'm confused.

15:12.002 --> 15:13.168
You guys coming at me?

15:13.170 --> 15:14.252
Of course not.

15:14.254 --> 15:15.286
But the press

15:15.288 --> 15:16.871
is just hung up on the timing.

15:16.873 --> 15:19.124
It's just an ugly piece of luck.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.708
If it's just about timing,
why is Holmes

15:20.710 --> 15:22.410
standing in my house

15:22.412 --> 15:23.762
talking about my shoes?

15:23.764 --> 15:25.463
Did you guys forget
there were two uniforms

15:25.465 --> 15:27.682
posted outside my door
all night last night

15:27.684 --> 15:29.384
in case Bradshaw
came after me again?

15:29.386 --> 15:30.918
That's not much of an
alibi, I'm afraid.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.587
I've already calculated
six different ways

15:32.589 --> 15:34.589
that you could have given
those patrolmen the slip.

15:35.858 --> 15:37.442
Fine. Four avenues of escape,

15:37.444 --> 15:39.060
plus two variations
on the fifth.

15:39.062 --> 15:40.761
There's the back balcony,
the fire escape...

15:40.763 --> 15:42.781
I know we're not the best
of friends or anything,

15:42.783 --> 15:44.949
but do you honestly believe
I would kill a man?

15:44.951 --> 15:47.285
Even one as worthless
as Curtis Bradshaw?

15:47.287 --> 15:48.536
I should think
anyone might kill,

15:48.538 --> 15:49.738
given the right circumstances.

15:51.574 --> 15:53.458
But no, I don't
think that you

15:53.460 --> 15:55.794
would shoot a man
in cold blood.

15:55.796 --> 15:57.078
Good.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.246
Nevertheless, you
will need answers

15:58.248 --> 15:59.497
rather than indignation

15:59.499 --> 16:00.915
when these questions
are being posed

16:00.917 --> 16:02.500
by someone other than us.

16:04.170 --> 16:06.137
Can you give us a minute?

16:06.139 --> 16:08.456
Water closet?

16:08.458 --> 16:11.259
If that means bathroom,
I'm sure you can find it.

16:13.979 --> 16:16.648
What's he mean,
questions being asked?

16:16.650 --> 16:19.484
You guys got a print from a boot
a thousand guys must own.

16:19.486 --> 16:22.687
We also got a perp
who took two center mass.

16:22.689 --> 16:25.190
Just like they trained us
at the academy.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.525
And nobody else with a gun
knows where to aim it?

16:27.527 --> 16:29.360
You got any real suspects?

16:29.362 --> 16:32.530
If we did, I wouldn't have to
put you on administrative duty.

16:36.486 --> 16:38.703
Hey, I don't bench you,

16:38.705 --> 16:40.338
how's it going to play?

16:40.340 --> 16:43.458
We're going to color
inside the lines on this.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.494
That way, when it's over,
everyone knows you're clean.

16:46.496 --> 16:49.464
Whenever you're ready, Captain.

16:54.169 --> 16:57.388
Whoever did this,
we're gonna find him.

16:57.390 --> 16:59.440
I promise you.

17:00.476 --> 17:02.009
You were held
at gunpoint?

17:02.011 --> 17:04.311
We both were.
Me and Sherlock's friend.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.563
His ex-dealer.

17:05.565 --> 17:06.897
There was
a struggle.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.617
Uh, the man with the gun
was incapacitated,

17:09.618 --> 17:11.368
but then Rhys was shot
in the abdomen.

17:11.371 --> 17:13.570
I was able to stabilize him
until the paramedics took over.

17:13.573 --> 17:15.740
Did he pull through,
the man who was shot?

17:15.742 --> 17:18.192
Yes, he did.
What about you?

17:18.194 --> 17:21.079
Have you noticed any post-
traumatic symptoms in yourself?

17:21.080 --> 17:22.213
Anxiety?

17:22.214 --> 17:23.414
No.

17:23.415 --> 17:24.482
Nightmares?

17:24.483 --> 17:27.385
I-I've been sleeping just fine.

17:27.387 --> 17:29.504
You know I've always
been supportive

17:29.506 --> 17:31.055
of your exploration
of Sherlock's work,

17:31.057 --> 17:34.409
but your pattern with him
has become troubling.

17:34.411 --> 17:36.261
For one thing,
you haven't told him

17:36.263 --> 17:38.713
you're no longer being paid
to serve as his sober companion.

17:38.715 --> 17:40.481
And now it sounds
as if your life

17:40.483 --> 17:41.933
is at risk in his home.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.018
Oh, he would agree with you.

17:44.020 --> 17:47.355
He's been pushing me
to learn self-defense.

17:48.908 --> 17:51.442
When's the last time you talked
about boundaries with him?

17:51.444 --> 17:54.195
Oh, I-I talk about them
all the time.

17:54.197 --> 17:55.896
He-he doesn't always listen.

17:55.898 --> 17:58.833
May I give you
my professional opinion?

17:58.835 --> 18:00.251
Please.

18:00.253 --> 18:03.755
It's time you moved on,
found a new client.

18:03.757 --> 18:05.757
It's been a
grand adventure,

18:05.759 --> 18:07.709
these last few months
with Sherlock,

18:07.711 --> 18:09.744
but it's run its course.

18:11.714 --> 18:15.266
But I'm not staying with him
for some "grand adventure."

18:15.268 --> 18:18.720
His work placed you in
real physical danger.

18:18.722 --> 18:20.905
You could have been killed.

18:23.192 --> 18:26.644
You claim he respects you,
that he cares about your safety.

18:26.646 --> 18:28.396
If he really cares,

18:28.398 --> 18:31.599
and if he's really as smart
as you say he is, tell me,

18:31.601 --> 18:34.519
why isn't he the one
telling you to move on?

18:46.298 --> 18:47.632
Is another test
of my reflexes?

18:47.634 --> 18:49.751
Because you're about
to see how quickly

18:49.753 --> 18:51.085
I can call the police.

18:51.087 --> 18:52.136
Watson, you startled me.

18:52.138 --> 18:53.454
Sorry about the din.

18:53.456 --> 18:54.973
I needed something
to obscure the sound

18:54.975 --> 18:56.624
of my ballistics exam.

18:56.626 --> 18:58.009
This is a residence.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.978
There are people that live
in this neighborhood.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.596
You don't do
a ballistics exam here.

19:01.598 --> 19:02.847
As a matter of fact,

19:02.849 --> 19:04.599
you don't do
a ballistics exam, period.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.966
You let the police
do them.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.185
Of course, you're right.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.486
But I'm afraid,
in this instance,

19:08.488 --> 19:09.737
surrendering this weapon
to the police

19:09.739 --> 19:11.305
was the last thing I could do.

19:16.912 --> 19:19.080
Glad you got
my message.

19:19.082 --> 19:21.699
I just wanted to tell you
that I reached out.

19:21.701 --> 19:24.669
Some of my old people,
they like their toys.

19:24.671 --> 19:28.589
You know how to tune up an MP5,
these boys know you.

19:28.591 --> 19:30.124
Man, what did I say?

19:30.126 --> 19:31.843
Hold up, hold up.

19:31.845 --> 19:34.545
I got a name. Tico Bettis.

19:34.547 --> 19:36.631
Out of Bed-Stuy.
If he's the one

19:36.633 --> 19:39.801
who tweaked that gun,
he might know who used it.

19:40.836 --> 19:42.303
You're welcome.

19:42.305 --> 19:43.504
You're not
allowed to be

19:43.506 --> 19:45.106
in contact with
your old people.

19:45.108 --> 19:46.274
I called a couple
of old friends

19:46.276 --> 19:47.725
'cause my brother
got shot at.

19:47.727 --> 19:50.478
You don't think the NYPD
knows about Tico?

19:50.480 --> 19:53.364
My boss talked to him
and five just like him

19:53.366 --> 19:55.566
before they pulled
my car out the gutter.

19:55.568 --> 19:57.035
He's clean.

19:57.037 --> 19:58.703
Your PO finds out
you've been talking

19:58.705 --> 20:01.289
to your old friends,
you go back in.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.623
For what? Nothing.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.827
Hey, hey, I just wanted
to help, man.

20:05.829 --> 20:09.196
Why don't you help yourself
for a change, huh?

20:09.198 --> 20:10.965
You can't understand
that I... that I...

20:10.967 --> 20:12.917
that I might want to do
something that matters?

20:12.919 --> 20:15.386
Look, I know what
you're going through.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.972
No, no, man, you got no idea.
Andre...

20:17.974 --> 20:19.874
You got no idea
what this is like.

20:21.093 --> 20:23.644
But who knows?

20:23.646 --> 20:26.314
Maybe someday...

20:26.316 --> 20:28.316
you will.

20:39.361 --> 20:41.446
So, I got a text
to be here?

20:41.448 --> 20:44.532
Yeah, he needs to talk
to you about something.

20:54.093 --> 20:56.377
Are those bullet holes
in that dummy?

20:56.379 --> 20:58.212
They are.
You know, if you fired a gun

20:58.214 --> 21:00.765
in here, I could arrest you.
I do.

21:00.767 --> 21:03.250
Someone want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

21:03.252 --> 21:05.803
Sherlock thinks that
someone's trying to frame you

21:05.805 --> 21:07.605
for the murder
of Curtis Bradshaw.

21:07.607 --> 21:10.475
Look, if this is about

21:10.477 --> 21:12.143
those Pergottis again,
we're talking about a boot

21:12.145 --> 21:14.529
you could buy in any
department store in the city.

21:14.531 --> 21:15.763
If the guy
who killed Bradshaw

21:15.765 --> 21:17.198
wanted me to
take the fall,

21:17.200 --> 21:18.933
he's the worst frame-up artist
I've ever seen.

21:18.935 --> 21:21.018
The boots were only
the first part of the plan.

21:21.020 --> 21:22.637
The gun was the second.
What gun?

21:22.639 --> 21:24.872
What are you
talking about?

21:24.874 --> 21:25.873
Where'd you get that?

21:25.875 --> 21:26.908
Your home.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.743
No sooner
had I entered

21:28.745 --> 21:30.495
your bathroom today
than I noticed

21:30.497 --> 21:33.381
the unmistakable scent
of a recently expended firearm.

21:33.383 --> 21:35.333
<i>I followed it</i>
<i>to an air-conditioning vent,</i>

21:35.335 --> 21:37.068
<i>found this nine-millimeter</i>

21:37.070 --> 21:38.553
tucked inside.

21:38.555 --> 21:40.972
I've never seen
that gun before in my life.

21:40.974 --> 21:42.623
I believe you.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.793
Yet it was the last thing
Curtis Bradshaw saw in his.

21:45.795 --> 21:48.062
I just compared the slugs
I fired into that dummy

21:48.064 --> 21:49.430
with images from the ones

21:49.432 --> 21:51.015
recovered from
Mr. Bradshaw's body.

21:51.850 --> 21:53.935
Perfect match.

22:02.550 --> 22:03.828
I just heard back
from the lab.

22:03.829 --> 22:05.162
They confirmed
this is the gun

22:05.164 --> 22:06.647
that was used to kill
Curtis Bradshaw.

22:06.649 --> 22:07.698
Do tell.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.149
I'm glad you found it.

22:09.151 --> 22:10.834
What exactly compelled you
to go poke around

22:10.836 --> 22:13.770
in Dumpsters in the neighborhood
where Bradshaw was shot?

22:13.942 --> 22:15.942
A hunch.
Oh.

22:15.944 --> 22:17.994
Well, I'm glad you found it.

22:17.996 --> 22:19.929
What I'm less glad about

22:19.931 --> 22:21.898
is that there were no prints
recovered.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.600
So, technically,

22:23.602 --> 22:26.169
you're still a suspect
in the shooting.

22:26.171 --> 22:28.571
I.A. hasn't given you
any grief yet, have they?

22:28.573 --> 22:29.956
Not yet.

22:29.958 --> 22:32.959
All right, well,
keep your cool,

22:32.961 --> 22:35.545
and we'll keep trying
to figure out

22:35.547 --> 22:37.380
who pulled the trigger.

22:37.382 --> 22:38.998
All right.

22:41.302 --> 22:43.720
You were uncomfortable with
the lie that we've told.

22:43.722 --> 22:45.388
You shouldn't be.
Easy for you to say.

22:45.390 --> 22:46.756
Why? Because I'm
a mere consultant

22:46.758 --> 22:48.141
and you're a real
policeman, huh?

22:48.143 --> 22:49.792
You think I don't
have as much respect

22:49.794 --> 22:51.094
for the captain
as you do?

22:51.096 --> 22:53.846
No, of course not.
Huh.

22:55.266 --> 22:58.017
I removed the gun from
your apartment for two reasons.

22:58.019 --> 23:00.803
Firstly, I'm absolutely certain
that you didn't shoot

23:00.805 --> 23:02.272
Curtis Bradshaw. Why?

23:02.274 --> 23:03.773
Because only an idiot
would've brought the gun

23:03.775 --> 23:05.158
back to his apartment
after he'd used it.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.526
And you, Detective,
are not an idiot.

23:06.528 --> 23:08.811
Thank you.
Secondly,

23:08.813 --> 23:10.997
I don't want to put
our friend, the captain,

23:10.999 --> 23:13.499
in the unenviable position
of having to open a case

23:13.501 --> 23:15.168
against his favored apprentice
and right-hand man.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.503
If he knew this gun
was found in your apartment,

23:17.505 --> 23:20.006
he would have no choice
but to inform Internal Affairs.

23:20.008 --> 23:22.008
The last thing our investigation
needs right now

23:22.010 --> 23:23.593
is a jaunt around
the bureaucratic maypole,

23:23.595 --> 23:24.961
wouldn't you agree?

23:24.963 --> 23:26.963
So, what now?

23:26.965 --> 23:29.299
I would like to take
a second look at your apartment.

23:31.185 --> 23:32.969
Just out of curiosity,
Detective, how many of those

23:32.971 --> 23:34.387
do you have--
keys to your apartment?

23:34.389 --> 23:35.671
Why do you want to know?

23:35.673 --> 23:37.106
Your framer obviously

23:37.108 --> 23:38.524
didn't force their way in,

23:38.526 --> 23:41.060
so they either picked the lock
or they have a key.

23:41.062 --> 23:42.862
No.

23:42.864 --> 23:44.864
You're certain?
Of course.

23:44.866 --> 23:47.367
Look, go to my place,
do that thing you do.

23:47.369 --> 23:49.185
I'll keep trying to
think of suspects.

23:49.187 --> 23:51.120
If anyone comes to
mind, I'll call you.

23:51.122 --> 23:53.356
Mmm.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.129
Andre?

24:00.131 --> 24:01.831
Over here.

24:01.833 --> 24:04.050
So what is it you couldn't
say to me over the phone?

24:04.052 --> 24:06.052
Oh, wait. I'm sorry.
Aren't you worried

24:06.054 --> 24:08.471
somebody here may
figure out we're family?

24:14.094 --> 24:16.879
I want to talk to you
about Curtis Bradshaw.

24:16.881 --> 24:19.899
Nah, see, I'm not allowed to
discuss criminal activity.

24:19.901 --> 24:22.986
You were pretty clear
about that last night.

24:22.988 --> 24:24.737
Would you please listen?

24:24.739 --> 24:27.073
Somebody's trying
to frame me for murder.

24:27.075 --> 24:30.159
That drive-by
was just a stunt.

24:30.161 --> 24:31.611
Somebody put Bradshaw's
stink on it,

24:31.613 --> 24:33.446
trying to fit me
for a motive.

24:33.448 --> 24:35.498
Then they killed the man,
and they...

24:35.500 --> 24:37.500
hid the gun in my house.

24:37.502 --> 24:38.901
Are you serious?

24:38.903 --> 24:40.203
Oh, we got a few leads.

24:40.205 --> 24:42.038
Obviously,
he knows where I live,

24:42.040 --> 24:44.540
had a way to get in
quick, quiet.

24:44.542 --> 24:47.677
And we know
he wears Pergotti boots.

24:48.745 --> 24:49.879
Just like the ones

24:49.881 --> 24:51.547
that were in
that box of clothes

24:51.549 --> 24:54.750
I gave you
when you first got out.

24:54.752 --> 24:56.469
You think it's me.
I didn't say that.

24:56.471 --> 24:58.888
Yeah, you did.
Hey, Andre...

24:58.890 --> 25:00.690
Well, that's why you brought
me down here, right?

25:00.692 --> 25:01.974
Just in case you
were right,

25:01.976 --> 25:03.393
you could throw me
in a cell somewhere.

25:03.395 --> 25:04.560
I mean, it's not
like I could

25:04.562 --> 25:06.029
bring a gun up
in here with...

25:06.031 --> 25:07.563
Hey, you stayed with me
when you first got out.

25:07.565 --> 25:09.148
You could have made a copy
of my house key.

25:09.150 --> 25:11.150
Then, last night, you said,
maybe someday I would

25:11.152 --> 25:12.402
know what it was like to be you?

25:12.404 --> 25:14.770
What, and you thought that
meant I would try to...

25:14.772 --> 25:17.407
Look, things have been bad

25:17.409 --> 25:19.876
between us
for a long time, Andre.

25:19.878 --> 25:21.327
No, things have been bad

25:21.329 --> 25:23.379
ever since you decided
to become a cop.

25:23.381 --> 25:25.882
I should have joined
a gang, like you?

25:25.884 --> 25:27.450
Gone out and run a corner?

25:27.452 --> 25:29.285
You know, I've sacrificed
everything for you.

25:29.287 --> 25:30.920
You did what came easy to you.

25:32.005 --> 25:34.640
The only thing you ever
sacrificed were years

25:34.642 --> 25:37.009
you could have shaved off
your sentence if you had rolled

25:37.011 --> 25:38.845
on your friends
when you got arrested.

25:38.847 --> 25:42.732
Years you could have
spent with me, with mom.

25:42.734 --> 25:46.152
Please, if that was you

25:46.154 --> 25:47.570
shot up my car
the other night,

25:47.572 --> 25:48.938
if you had anything to do

25:48.940 --> 25:50.323
with what happened
to Curtis Bradshaw,

25:50.325 --> 25:52.692
now is the time
to tell me.

25:52.694 --> 25:55.661
Now is the time
to let me try and help you.

25:57.482 --> 25:59.282
Andre?

25:59.284 --> 26:00.783
Hey.

26:00.785 --> 26:02.835
Andre?

26:02.837 --> 26:04.871
Bell! Bell!

26:04.873 --> 26:06.205
Hey, back.

26:06.207 --> 26:09.008
Back! Hey, it's
okay. It's fine.

26:09.010 --> 26:11.660
It's all right.
He's my brother.

26:13.764 --> 26:18.217
Oh, I take it the
bathroom is also a bust.

26:18.219 --> 26:19.668
That depends.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.137
Can you think of any reason

26:21.139 --> 26:22.855
that Bell would have
a lingerie catalogue

26:22.857 --> 26:24.307
in which your head
has been superimposed

26:24.309 --> 26:25.892
on almost all
of the models?

26:25.894 --> 26:27.727
He hasn't, but can you think
of any reason he would?

26:27.729 --> 26:29.512
Okay, you're just
frustrated because

26:29.514 --> 26:30.897
we've been here
for a few hours

26:30.899 --> 26:32.532
and we haven't
found anything.

26:32.534 --> 26:34.517
I'm <i>annoyed</i> because
we haven't found anything.

26:34.519 --> 26:36.035
I'm frustrated because,

26:36.037 --> 26:38.404
despite the recent attempt
on a colleague's life,

26:38.406 --> 26:40.823
you still haven't agreed
to learn self-defense.

26:40.825 --> 26:42.241
You know, I appreciate

26:42.243 --> 26:43.993
your concern with my safety,
I really do,

26:43.995 --> 26:45.495
but I think we need
to have a conversation

26:45.497 --> 26:47.196
about boundaries.

26:47.198 --> 26:48.697
Okay, you know, you've given me
this incredible window

26:48.699 --> 26:50.883
into what you do,
and you know what?

26:50.885 --> 26:52.885
It is fascinating,
but at the end of the day,

26:52.887 --> 26:55.054
I am not your apprentice.
I am your sober companion.

26:55.056 --> 26:56.839
No, you're not!
No, you are not.

26:56.841 --> 26:59.041
You haven't been
for quite some time.

26:59.043 --> 27:00.893
Sherlock, what are you...?
I know that

27:00.895 --> 27:02.595
you lied to me
several weeks ago when you said

27:02.597 --> 27:04.263
that my father
had renewed your contract.

27:04.265 --> 27:06.482
I found out when
I telephoned him last week.

27:07.986 --> 27:09.902
I'm not angry.

27:09.904 --> 27:12.438
If anything, I am grateful.

27:12.440 --> 27:14.607
You saw that
I was in a raw state,

27:14.609 --> 27:17.910
and you stayed
to see me through it.

27:17.912 --> 27:19.779
Now, when I learned
of the lie, however,

27:19.781 --> 27:24.534
I-I deliberately adopted
a more sanguine mood.

27:24.536 --> 27:26.669
I wanted you to see
that I was well again

27:26.671 --> 27:28.671
so you could... move on.

27:30.090 --> 27:32.542
But the most curious thing
happened.

27:32.544 --> 27:35.127
You stayed.

27:35.129 --> 27:38.681
Days passed,
then a week.

27:38.683 --> 27:40.600
It became clearer and clearer

27:40.602 --> 27:42.718
that you were not
staying for me,

27:42.720 --> 27:44.353
but for yourself.

27:44.355 --> 27:46.472
Sherlock, I...

27:46.474 --> 27:48.558
It's difficult for you
to say aloud, I know,

27:48.560 --> 27:50.109
so I won't ask you to.

27:50.111 --> 27:54.313
Rather, I would ask you
to consider a proposal.

27:54.315 --> 27:56.765
Stay on permanently.

27:56.767 --> 28:00.620
Not as my sober companion,
but as my companion.

28:00.622 --> 28:03.456
Allow me to continue
to teach you.

28:03.458 --> 28:06.325
Assist me
in my investigations.

28:06.327 --> 28:09.161
In return,
you will receive a stipend

28:09.163 --> 28:10.713
that will at least equal

28:10.715 --> 28:12.999
the salary my father
was paying you.

28:13.001 --> 28:15.918
You don't even have
a source of income.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.804
I have certain funds
set aside.

28:18.806 --> 28:22.258
You may continue
to reside at the brownstone,

28:22.260 --> 28:24.810
you may reside elsewhere.

28:24.812 --> 28:27.647
You may also consider
yourself relieved

28:27.649 --> 28:29.899
of any and all
confidentiality burdens

28:29.901 --> 28:32.518
with regards
to my sobriety.

28:33.604 --> 28:36.522
See, this is
an important decision,

28:36.524 --> 28:39.692
and I encourage you
to discuss it with others.

28:41.361 --> 28:44.163
Explain what
you have been to me...

28:44.165 --> 28:48.167
and what <i>I</i> believe
you <i>can</i> be to me.

28:48.169 --> 28:50.419
Hmm?

28:50.421 --> 28:52.988
Partner.

29:04.635 --> 29:07.803
Oh, and lest you think
that this is an act

29:07.805 --> 29:11.190
of, uh, charity, a gift
from a grateful client,

29:11.192 --> 29:14.727
let me assure you,
it is not.

29:15.946 --> 29:18.864
I am... better with you, Watson.

29:18.866 --> 29:22.451
Um, I'm sharper,
I'm more focused.

29:26.657 --> 29:29.325
Difficult to say why, exactly.

29:31.861 --> 29:34.997
Perhaps, in time,
I'll solve that, as well.

29:45.977 --> 29:47.677
Andre?

29:47.679 --> 29:50.846
Look, I know you're in there.
I can hear the TV.

29:52.232 --> 29:55.050
I just... I want to apologize
for what I said before.

29:55.052 --> 29:58.104
I never should have called you
down to the station like that.

29:58.106 --> 29:59.488
Can you just... Andre?

29:59.490 --> 30:01.557
Andre, you in here?

30:01.559 --> 30:03.793
...opening fire
with a 12-gauge shotgun...

30:03.795 --> 30:05.111
Andre!

30:13.620 --> 30:17.206
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

30:17.208 --> 30:21.043
Hold on. Hold on.

30:23.263 --> 30:25.681
Yeah. This is
Detective Marcus Bell,

30:25.683 --> 30:28.434
badge number 42819.

30:28.436 --> 30:31.220
I need an bus
at 73 Parsons Boulevard.

30:31.222 --> 30:33.939
Male shot at the scene.

30:33.941 --> 30:38.060
Be advised, the victim...
is my brother.

30:39.863 --> 30:42.431
Come here.

31:02.209 --> 31:03.592
It's interesting.

31:03.594 --> 31:05.694
We were in Detective
Bell's apartment

31:05.696 --> 31:07.629
for four hours this afternoon.

31:07.631 --> 31:09.865
I saw nothing that would
indicate he had a brother.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.533
Well, he did say before
he left for the hospital

31:11.535 --> 31:13.235
that they were not
on the best of terms.

31:13.237 --> 31:15.804
Still... I'm me.

31:19.193 --> 31:20.258
You've been staring
at that message

31:20.260 --> 31:21.943
for over five minutes now.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.111
Have I?

31:23.113 --> 31:25.397
I don't think
it's a coded message.

31:25.399 --> 31:30.068
No. No, but it's admirable,
though, isn't it?

31:30.070 --> 31:32.821
I mean, whoever tried
to frame Detective Bell

31:32.823 --> 31:34.373
clearly had the same idea here.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.908
I foiled the first
frame-up when I delivered

31:36.910 --> 31:38.443
the nine-millimeter
to the police.

31:38.445 --> 31:40.629
I said that I found it, hmm?

31:40.631 --> 31:42.831
They tried a second attempt.

31:42.833 --> 31:45.300
Detective Bell's sibling
lost consciousness,

31:45.302 --> 31:48.220
but before he did,
he makes a valiant attempt

31:48.222 --> 31:51.089
to make sure that he doesn't end
up a prop in that masquerade.

31:51.091 --> 31:52.924
How do you know
it was the same shooter?

31:52.926 --> 31:54.409
Andre is an ex-convict.

31:54.411 --> 31:57.596
His legal file
is over four inches thick.

31:57.598 --> 31:59.931
Who knows what kind of trouble
he might have been in?

31:59.933 --> 32:02.901
Obviously, Andre Bell knew
that he wasn't in any at all.

32:02.903 --> 32:05.470
Why else would he use what
might have been his last breath

32:05.472 --> 32:07.239
to try and clear his brother?

32:07.241 --> 32:09.491
He understood what this was.

32:11.244 --> 32:12.811
Look.

32:18.786 --> 32:21.536
You see the slight declivity
in the dirt?

32:23.823 --> 32:26.124
If that's not another
partial Pergotti footprint

32:26.126 --> 32:28.126
meant to implicate
Detective Bell,

32:28.128 --> 32:29.711
I'll stop throwing
tennis balls at you.

32:29.713 --> 32:31.680
You can tell what that is
all the way from here?

32:33.049 --> 32:34.716
Don't you think
it's time for us

32:34.718 --> 32:36.635
to tell Captain Gregson
about the framer?

32:36.637 --> 32:39.471
I think I would like to discuss
it with the detective first.

32:39.473 --> 32:41.807
I obviously put
certain wheels in motion

32:41.809 --> 32:44.443
when I removed the handgun
from his apartment.

32:44.445 --> 32:46.695
I don't want to make another
move without his consent.

32:48.448 --> 32:49.731
<i>I'll tell him.</i>

32:49.733 --> 32:50.982
You were
just trying

32:50.984 --> 32:52.734
to help me out,
and him.

32:52.736 --> 32:54.319
He'll understand, but...

32:54.321 --> 32:55.821
but I think he'll
take it better

32:55.823 --> 32:58.156
coming from me.

32:58.158 --> 32:59.825
Look, this
isn't right.

32:59.827 --> 33:01.660
They said they were
gonna close him up

33:01.662 --> 33:03.528
20 minutes ago.

33:03.530 --> 33:04.863
It takes time.

33:04.865 --> 33:07.048
It's a good sign
they decided to suture.

33:09.035 --> 33:11.052
You saved his life.

33:11.054 --> 33:13.088
If anyone could take

33:13.090 --> 33:15.206
two slugs to the back
and pull through,

33:15.208 --> 33:17.709
it's Andre.

33:17.711 --> 33:19.644
He's a stubborn bastard.

33:19.646 --> 33:21.313
Today that is a good thing.

33:21.315 --> 33:23.748
About time it started
working for him--

33:23.750 --> 33:25.083
ruined the last three years

33:25.085 --> 33:27.051
of his life.
What do you mean?

33:27.053 --> 33:29.354
Nothing. I just...

33:29.356 --> 33:33.024
never quite forgave him for
staying in as long as he did.

33:33.026 --> 33:35.861
A while back,
I cashed in a big favor

33:35.863 --> 33:38.196
to get him
an early parole hearing.

33:38.198 --> 33:40.398
But the dope...

33:40.400 --> 33:42.434
he wouldn't
play ball.

33:42.436 --> 33:45.504
All he had to do was identify
his gang's drug hookup.

33:45.506 --> 33:48.206
Mind you, the police already
knew who the guy was.

33:48.208 --> 33:50.709
He was serving
ten to 20.

33:50.711 --> 33:52.644
But Andre has his code.

33:52.646 --> 33:55.797
He wouldn't talk;
served his full term.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.518
It was you.

33:59.520 --> 34:02.087
You were the one
who blew the whistle

34:02.089 --> 34:03.939
on the Curtis Bradshaw detail.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.640
What?

34:05.642 --> 34:08.927
I looked at some
of Andre's files tonight.

34:08.929 --> 34:11.947
<i>His first parole hearing</i>
<i>was June 2009,</i>

34:11.949 --> 34:14.065
one month after Mickey Hudson

34:14.067 --> 34:15.900
was busted
for planting evidence.

34:15.902 --> 34:17.652
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:17.654 --> 34:19.471
It fits.

34:19.473 --> 34:21.438
Your place is immaculate.

34:21.440 --> 34:23.241
Your sock drawer
is immaculate.

34:23.243 --> 34:25.176
You're a straight shooter
in every corner of your life,

34:25.178 --> 34:27.462
and your frustration with Andre
because he wouldn't talk...

34:27.464 --> 34:28.947
I don't see why it matters.

34:28.949 --> 34:30.949
It matters, Detective.
Did you earn the favor

34:30.951 --> 34:33.083
by informing
on your boss or not?

34:33.085 --> 34:36.170
I wasn't gonna watch
some dirtbag plant evidence.

34:36.172 --> 34:38.223
That wasn't right.
Someone had to speak up.

34:38.225 --> 34:40.559
So what?
So what?

34:40.561 --> 34:42.627
We've been looking
at the wrong pool of suspects.

34:42.629 --> 34:45.597
Anyone from the old detail would
have had the requisite skills

34:45.599 --> 34:47.966
and the motive
to carry out these crimes.

34:47.967 --> 34:49.484
They'd want to see you punished.

34:49.485 --> 34:50.601
Nobody knew.

34:50.603 --> 34:52.520
Perhaps they found out.

34:56.525 --> 34:58.142
You wanted
to see me, Captain?

34:58.144 --> 35:00.144
Have a seat,
Officer Reyes.

35:11.925 --> 35:14.459
Did I do something wrong?
Oh, we have reason

35:14.461 --> 35:17.012
to believe you did
several things wrong.

35:17.014 --> 35:19.798
Shooting up
Detective Bell's car,

35:19.800 --> 35:21.349
for example.

35:21.351 --> 35:23.768
Killing Curtis Bradshaw.

35:23.770 --> 35:26.504
Planting the murder weapon
in Bell's residence.

35:26.506 --> 35:29.641
Shooting his brother when the
first frame-up went sideways.

35:29.643 --> 35:32.394
Wha... what?

35:32.396 --> 35:35.480
We recently had occasion
to take a very careful look

35:35.482 --> 35:38.733
at the members of the Curtis
Bradshaw detail who worked

35:38.735 --> 35:39.985
<i>with Detective Mickey Hudson</i>

35:39.987 --> 35:42.871
in 2009, and there you were.

35:42.873 --> 35:44.739
Yeah, and?

35:44.741 --> 35:47.325
Well, you looked up to Hudson,
you respected him.

35:47.327 --> 35:49.027
He wrote you a recommendation
when you applied

35:49.029 --> 35:50.378
for promotion to the vice squad.

35:50.380 --> 35:52.163
Yeah, he was good police.

35:52.165 --> 35:53.999
Well, there are some members
of Internal Affairs

35:54.001 --> 35:55.000
who would disagree with you.

35:55.002 --> 35:56.251
The rat squad?

35:56.253 --> 35:58.303
I never much cared
what they thought.

35:58.305 --> 36:01.056
Well, Detective Evan Carlyle,

36:01.058 --> 36:02.924
of the rat squad,

36:02.926 --> 36:05.209
would be most disappointed
to hear you say that.

36:05.211 --> 36:07.178
We know that you've been
seeing him on and off

36:07.180 --> 36:08.379
for the past few months.

36:08.381 --> 36:10.015
And we strongly suspect

36:10.017 --> 36:12.383
it had something to
with gaining access to his most

36:12.385 --> 36:13.685
sensitive files.

36:13.687 --> 36:15.820
Three years ago, when I.A. first

36:15.822 --> 36:17.522
started to investigate Hudson,

36:17.524 --> 36:20.058
they came to suspect that maybe
you had helped him steal

36:20.060 --> 36:23.078
the drugs that wended their way
into Curtis Bradshaw's home.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.897
Yeah, they questioned me.

36:25.899 --> 36:28.616
I told them I had
nothing to do with it.

36:28.618 --> 36:30.835
And Hudson backed
your story, probably

36:30.837 --> 36:33.404
because he'd already
decided to kill himself.

36:33.406 --> 36:35.573
Why's he gonna ruin your life

36:35.575 --> 36:37.459
when he'd already decided
to end his own?

36:37.461 --> 36:41.262
But you still had
a black mark against you.

36:41.264 --> 36:43.298
Department couldn't take
any real action against you,

36:43.300 --> 36:47.352
but you were told
vice was never gonna happen.

36:47.354 --> 36:48.937
You were undeterred.

36:48.939 --> 36:50.138
You applied three more times.

36:50.140 --> 36:51.923
After your most
recent rejection,

36:51.925 --> 36:52.941
I imagine you were incensed.

36:52.943 --> 36:55.060
You simply
had to know--

36:55.062 --> 36:58.730
who was it who tipped off I.A.
as to Hudson's transgressions?

36:58.732 --> 37:00.732
Must have broken your heart
when you found out

37:00.734 --> 37:02.617
that it was Detective Bell.

37:02.619 --> 37:04.486
Someone you had dated.

37:04.488 --> 37:06.571
Someone who'd given you
the key to his apartment.

37:06.573 --> 37:08.406
He must've known--
he made no mention

37:08.408 --> 37:10.075
of your name when
he filed his report.

37:10.077 --> 37:12.043
He had absolutely no clue
as to your involvement.

37:12.045 --> 37:14.796
When we told him
a short while ago-- stunned.

37:17.383 --> 37:18.750
You have a problem

37:18.752 --> 37:19.801
with me, Captain?

37:19.803 --> 37:21.953
Take it up with my union rep.

37:21.955 --> 37:24.122
So, we visited your
home this morning.

37:24.124 --> 37:27.559
Um, would you care

37:27.561 --> 37:31.012
to explain these?

37:31.931 --> 37:33.598
Shoelace eyelets.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.483
From a pair of Pergotti boots.

37:35.485 --> 37:37.102
The same boots you used

37:37.104 --> 37:39.020
<i>to plant footprints</i>
<i>that you knew would lead back</i>

37:39.022 --> 37:41.139
to Detective Bell.

37:41.141 --> 37:42.857
You torched them in your garage,
but those didn't burn.

37:42.859 --> 37:45.360
Does the name Denny Vargas
mean anything to you?

37:45.362 --> 37:48.646
Should do-- you arrested
him two months ago

37:48.648 --> 37:50.031
in his home.

37:50.033 --> 37:51.916
It was suspected
that Vargas was maintaining

37:51.918 --> 37:54.869
an arsenal of untraceable,
unregistered firearms.

37:54.871 --> 37:58.173
Strangely none of those
firearms were seized

37:58.175 --> 38:00.491
by you during the arrest.

38:00.493 --> 38:03.094
Well, not officially anyway.

38:03.096 --> 38:05.597
The assault on
Detective Bell's car was done

38:05.599 --> 38:07.048
with a modified MP5.

38:07.050 --> 38:10.552
Bradshaw was killed
with a Colt nine-millimeter.

38:10.554 --> 38:11.886
And Andre Bell was shot

38:11.888 --> 38:14.005
<i>with an as yet undiscovered</i>

38:14.007 --> 38:15.390
.22 caliber pistol.

38:15.392 --> 38:18.059
The lab ran tests,
and the bullet profiles

38:18.061 --> 38:21.529
for these attacks match
several of the crimes

38:21.531 --> 38:23.798
committed by Denny Vargas.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.650
It's interesting, no?

38:25.652 --> 38:29.495
You arrest him,
his guns disappear.

38:29.496 --> 38:32.330
Could it be, Officer Reyes,

38:32.332 --> 38:34.649
that you are stockpiling
your own personal armory

38:34.651 --> 38:37.952
of untraceable guns?

38:47.012 --> 38:49.497
Oh, why am I not surprised
he's not here?

38:50.833 --> 38:52.967
Bell.

38:52.969 --> 38:56.521
He would never say anything
like this to my face.

39:00.025 --> 39:02.477
It's not his style.

39:02.479 --> 39:04.395
Officer Paula Reyes
was arrested this morning...

39:04.397 --> 39:07.181
So even if she pleads out,

39:07.183 --> 39:11.119
that'll be life, right?

39:11.121 --> 39:13.488
Probably.

39:19.245 --> 39:21.463
You remember Sharise?

39:21.465 --> 39:23.164
Mm-hmm.

39:23.166 --> 39:25.116
She cut the spokes
on my bike

39:25.118 --> 39:28.119
when we broke up
in the seventh grade.

39:28.121 --> 39:31.973
But that's the worst thing any
of my exes tried to do to me.

39:38.481 --> 39:41.566
Andre, about what
I said the other day,

39:41.568 --> 39:42.851
asking you if you, uh...

39:42.853 --> 39:44.185
Don't.

39:44.187 --> 39:45.487
You don't have
to say anything.

39:45.489 --> 39:47.071
No, I do.

39:47.073 --> 39:49.073
I do. I'm sorry.

39:49.075 --> 39:52.193
I, uh...

39:52.195 --> 39:54.929
It's cool, Marcus.

39:54.931 --> 39:57.248
It's cool, seriously.

39:58.567 --> 40:00.568
I-I got to ask.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.620
The note you left?

40:02.622 --> 40:04.405
"Was not Marcus"?

40:04.407 --> 40:07.175
You told me someone tried

40:07.177 --> 40:08.459
to frame you for a shooting.

40:08.461 --> 40:10.428
I-I don't know.

40:10.430 --> 40:11.713
I just figured maybe

40:11.715 --> 40:13.031
it was the same guy.

40:13.033 --> 40:15.183
No, I know, but...

40:15.185 --> 40:17.919
we-we fought yesterday.

40:17.921 --> 40:19.587
You were shot in the back.

40:19.589 --> 40:21.306
No way you saw who did it.

40:21.308 --> 40:23.608
No way you could've known
for sure it wasn't me.

40:23.610 --> 40:25.727
But I did know.

40:25.729 --> 40:28.446
I know you.

40:30.065 --> 40:34.035
And you got to look out
for family.

40:34.037 --> 40:36.821
Even when they disappoint you.

40:41.744 --> 40:45.112
You're rearranging
the locks again.

40:48.283 --> 40:51.786
You're doing it by...

40:51.788 --> 40:54.088
date of manufacture,

40:54.090 --> 40:55.790
earliest to latest.
Yep.

40:55.792 --> 40:58.927
Seems like the most sensible
way to display them.

40:58.929 --> 41:00.311
This week anyway.

41:04.817 --> 41:06.484
I like to be paid
on Thursdays.

41:08.821 --> 41:10.154
And since I don't
have an apartment

41:10.156 --> 41:11.823
right now, I will
stay here rent-free

41:11.825 --> 41:12.941
until I find something else.

41:12.943 --> 41:14.325
And you will
continue going

41:14.327 --> 41:15.610
to group support
meetings with me

41:15.612 --> 41:17.829
for as long
as we work together.

41:19.982 --> 41:23.785
Congratulations
on your new career, Watson.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.610
Just one more thing
for this to work.

41:33.611 --> 41:35.209
Yes, what's that?

41:35.210 --> 41:36.694
Ow!

41:36.696 --> 41:39.080
Could have been a knife.
