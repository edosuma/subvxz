14:13.894 --> 14:18.440
THE MOST INFAMOUS PENAL COLONY
IN THE WORLD,

14:18.524 --> 14:19.441
NOT COUNTING AUSTRALIA.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.653
I AM CAPTAIN STONEWALL.

14:22.736 --> 14:27.116
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
TO SERVING THE PRISON,

14:27.199 --> 14:30.536
FIRST AS A GUARD,
AND NOW...

14:30.619 --> 14:33.747
AS A TOUR GUIDE.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.792
NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY, YOU.

14:39.378 --> 14:42.298
ENJOY YOUR VISIT.

14:42.381 --> 14:45.217
- [screaming]

14:46.927 --> 14:49.138
- AH, NOT SO FAST, MISTER.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.724
I'M TAKING YOU TO SEE SOLITARY.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.941
- HUH?

15:01.025 --> 15:04.486
SCOOTER DOOGLE
AND MARBLES MCGEE?

15:04.570 --> 15:05.946
IT CAN'T BE.

15:09.366 --> 15:13.412
- OH, SAYS HERE INMATES
NEVER CHOOSE WHAT THEY EAT.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.999
HEAR THAT, HAPPY?

15:17.082 --> 15:19.877
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TEACH YOU
NOT TO GO OFF-LEASH

15:19.960 --> 15:20.336
IF YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING OFF LEASH?

15:20.419 --> 15:23.505
- [growling]

15:23.589 --> 15:26.550
- [laughing]

15:33.599 --> 15:34.516
- [growls]

15:34.600 --> 15:36.352
- HAPPY!

15:36.435 --> 15:38.187
DO YOU THINK I AM DOING THIS
FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.396
- HMPH!

15:39.480 --> 15:41.523
- [gasps]

15:41.607 --> 15:43.150
DON'T YOU WHATEVS ME,
MISTER!

15:44.860 --> 15:47.655
- [whimpering]

15:50.199 --> 15:51.909
- THAT'S THE PRISON SPIRIT, PEN.

15:51.992 --> 15:54.703
- UH...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.246
[sighs]

15:56.330 --> 15:57.581
- WAY TO SELL THE SCARES
FOR HAPPY.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.624
THANKS, PEN.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.502
- IT IS YOU.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.879
- YUP, IT'S ME!

16:04.963 --> 16:06.548
[laughter]

16:06.632 --> 16:08.342
- SEE YOU IN THE FUNNY PAGES,
COPPER.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.887
- HEY, DO YOU WORK HERE?

16:11.970 --> 16:13.681
- "WORK HERE"?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.557
I LIVE HERE.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.558
- OH, GREAT.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.060
CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.229
MY DOG NEEDS TO BE
SCARED STRAIGHT,

16:20.312 --> 16:23.273
BUT HE'S GOING THROUGH
A "NOTHING IMPRESSES ME" PHASE.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.568
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU GIVE HIM
A SPECIAL DELUXE TOUR?

16:26.652 --> 16:30.948
LIKE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT
THE SCREAMING ALL NIGHT,

16:31.031 --> 16:33.534
THE LUNCHTIME RIOTS,

16:33.617 --> 16:35.828
THE SOUL-CRUSHING LONELINESS.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.080
YOU KNOW,
THE DOWNSIDE TO PRISON.

16:40.124 --> 16:44.378
- HOW 'BOUT I TOSS YOU IN A CELL
AND THROW AWAY THE KEY?

16:44.461 --> 16:46.422
- OOH, SO DRAMATIC.

16:46.505 --> 16:47.047
YOU REALLY KNOW HOW
TO CRIPPLE THE SPIRIT.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.511
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS
ALMOST TOO EASY.

16:52.594 --> 16:53.595
FOLLOW ME.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.889
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.725
I WILL DEFINITELY NOTE
YOUR HELPFULNESS

16:57.808 --> 16:59.101
WHEN I FILL OUT
MY VISITOR COMMENTS.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.478
AND PLEASE,
KEEP GRINDING YOUR TEETH.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.230
THAT IS SO EFFECTIVE.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.445
- EWW.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.614
- SAY, CAPTAIN STONEWALL,

17:12.698 --> 17:15.784
DID ANY PRISONERS
EVER ESCAPE ALCATRAZ?

17:18.203 --> 17:19.579
- ONLY TWO.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.958
UNDER THE COVER OF NIGHT,
BY HOT AIR BALLOON.

17:23.040 --> 17:26.670
BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT,
DON'T YOU?

17:26.753 --> 17:29.089
- I DID READ SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT IN THE PAMPHLET.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.549
EVERYBODY BLAMES THE ARCHITECT,

17:30.632 --> 17:33.051
BUT, PERSONALLY,
I BLAME THE GUARD.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.636
WHAT A NINCOMPOOP.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.554
I HOPE THEY TOOK AWAY
HIS PENSION.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.389
- THEY DID.

17:43.270 --> 17:47.357
TIME TO FINISH YOUR LIFE
SENTENCES, MCGEE AND DOOGLE.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.568
- OOH.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.861
PRISON NICKNAMES.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.322
I LOVE THIS TOUR.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.282
- I KNEW YOU'D BE BACK.

17:55.365 --> 17:58.869
ALL CRIMINALS RETURN
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.663
OF COURSE, MOST OF 'EM DON'T
BRING THEIR OWN PRISON STRIPES.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.500
- "THEIR OWN PRISON STRIPES."

18:04.583 --> 18:05.542
[chuckling]

18:05.626 --> 18:07.336
BOY, YOU ARE GOOD.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.670
SCARED YET, HAPPY?

18:08.754 --> 18:09.087
HAPPY?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.635
HAPPY!

18:14.718 --> 18:16.345
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
LOCKED UP TOO.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.680
- [laughing]

18:18.764 --> 18:21.350
- YES, I SEE THE IRONY.

18:21.433 --> 18:21.767
NOW, GET BACK HERE.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.270
- [laughing]

18:27.105 --> 18:28.524
- MR. GOVERNOR,

18:28.607 --> 18:31.318
I'VE FINALLY CAUGHT SCOOTER
DOOGLE AND MARBLES MCGEE.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.532
OH, DON'T YOU WORRY, SIR.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.574
THEY'RE NEVER GETTING OUT AGAIN.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.410
[maniacal laugh]

18:40.494 --> 18:43.080
- HUH?

18:44.706 --> 18:46.166
- OH, THAT DOG.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
HE'S REALLY TESTING THE LIMITS
THESE DAYS.

18:48.460 --> 18:51.171
WELL, AT LEAST WE GET TO ENJOY
ALL THE PERKS OF PRISON.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.424
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

18:54.508 --> 18:55.801
- WHAT?

18:55.884 --> 18:59.096
AND MISS TESTING OUT
THESE BUNK BEDS?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.431
screech!

19:01.515 --> 19:04.476
[squeaking]

19:06.103 --> 19:09.231
PLUS, AS A PRISONER, YOU START
TALKING LIKE THIS, SEE?

19:09.314 --> 19:10.566
YEAH.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.609
AND YOU'LL FINALLY HAVE TIME
TO LEARN HARMONICA

19:12.693 --> 19:14.361
AND THE ART OF CARVING SOAP.

19:14.444 --> 19:15.904
WHICH ONE
DO YOU WANT TO TRY FIRST?

19:16.989 --> 19:20.325
- HMM, SOAP DOES TASTE BETTER...

19:20.409 --> 19:21.827
SEE?

19:27.624 --> 19:29.626
[knocks on door]

19:33.046 --> 19:36.091
- ALL DELIVERIES GO THROUGH ME.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.099
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING
TO BREAK SOMEONE OUT...

19:44.182 --> 19:45.017
clank!

19:45.100 --> 19:45.183
WOULD YOU, DOG?

19:50.522 --> 19:53.525
- ♪ HERE COMES THE STORY
OF THE HONEYBEE ♪

19:53.609 --> 19:56.028
♪ ALCATRAZ IS ALL
SHE WANTED TO SEE ♪

19:56.111 --> 19:58.071
PEN, YOU GOT A GIFT
FOR WHITTLING.

19:58.155 --> 20:02.159
- I CALL THIS PIECE
<i>ME IN SOAP.</i>

20:02.242 --> 20:04.244
[knocks on door]

20:04.870 --> 20:06.622
- MR. GOVERNOR?

20:06.705 --> 20:09.499
- [barking]

20:09.583 --> 20:11.877
- YOU'RE PARDONING
ALL THE PRISONERS?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.462
ARE YOU INSANE?

20:13.545 --> 20:15.297
- [barking]

20:15.380 --> 20:17.090
- YES, SIR.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.425
YOU ARE THE GOVERNOR.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.471
WAIT A MINUTE.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.806
IF YOU'RE REALLY THE GOVERNOR,

20:24.890 --> 20:27.309
WHAT'S MY ANNUAL SALARY?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.810
- [barks hesitantly]

20:28.894 --> 20:30.354
- BEFORE TAXES.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.191
NO!

20:34.274 --> 20:35.359
NOT THE MUSTACHE!

20:36.193 --> 20:39.780
- AH, REMEMBER MY OLD DOG,
HAPPY?

20:39.863 --> 20:42.491
I WONDER WHAT HE'S UP TO
ON THE OUTSIDE.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.825
IF I KNOW HIM,

20:43.909 --> 20:45.577
HE'S PROBABLY
STILL GALLIVANTING OFF-LEASH.

20:45.661 --> 20:49.456
[groans]

20:49.539 --> 20:49.915
PHEW.

20:49.998 --> 20:52.709
[knocks on door]

20:57.547 --> 20:58.966
- I LOVE BIRTHDAYS.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.176
I'LL GRAB SOME CANDLES
FROM THE GIFT SHOP.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.306
- WELL, WELL, WELL,

21:06.390 --> 21:09.601
LOOK WHO FINALLY DECIDED
TO JOIN IN THE FUN.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.270
NOT THAT THIS IS
SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.605
OH.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.525
THE OLD NAIL FILE
IN THE CAKE ROUTINE,

21:16.608 --> 21:18.860
SO WE CAN "ESCAPE."

21:18.944 --> 21:20.904
- SHH!

21:23.573 --> 21:25.701
clang!

21:25.784 --> 21:27.911
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE SPONGE CAKE.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.373
A JETPACK?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.291
- [whimpering]

21:33.375 --> 21:36.628
- THIS'LL GET YOU ANOTHER
LIFE SENTENCE, MCGEE.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.504
YOU TOO, DOOGLE.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.135
[screams]

21:43.218 --> 21:44.511
- WHOA.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.805
WHAT IS THE BUDGET
OF THIS TOUR?

21:46.888 --> 21:48.390
- OKAY, DINNER TIME.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.975
MY DAD'S MAKING PIZZA PADOODLES.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.685
GOT TO GO.

21:51.768 --> 21:55.605
UH, ARE YOU GUYS COMING,
OR ARE YOU STILL PLAYING PRISON?

21:55.689 --> 21:57.733
- HOW DID YOU DIG THIS?

21:57.816 --> 21:59.067
WHEN DID YOU DIG THIS?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.736
- I CARVED A SHOVEL OUT OF SOAP,

22:00.819 --> 22:03.405
THEN DUG WHILE YOU
LIFTED WEIGHTS WITH SOAP ME.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.699
- PENNY, YOU NEVER CEASE
TO AMAZE ME.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.874
AH, SMELL THAT, DOLL FACES?

22:13.957 --> 22:16.251
THAT'S FREEDOM, SEE?

22:16.334 --> 22:19.755
- FREEDOM SMELLS LIKE
PIZZA PADOODLES, SEE?

22:19.838 --> 22:21.339
- DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING TODAY,
HAPS?

22:21.423 --> 22:22.049
zoom!

22:22.132 --> 22:25.802
HAPPY, LEASHES ARE THE LAW!

22:33.018 --> 22:34.978
- DON'T LOOK BACK, DOG.
