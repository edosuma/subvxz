38:42.561 --> 38:44.145
<i>that the family was doing,</i>

38:44.229 --> 38:46.397
<i>hoping that they would get
some kind of clue.</i>

38:46.482 --> 38:48.491
<i>But behind the scenes,</i>

38:48.650 --> 38:50.818
they were constantly
harassing the family.

38:50.903 --> 38:52.829
<i>When my grandmother passed away,</i>

38:52.913 --> 38:55.406
<i>of course the FBI was there
at the funeral.</i>

38:55.491 --> 38:56.991
<i>The FBI harassed the family</i>

38:57.076 --> 38:59.660
<i>all the way up
into the late '70s</i>

38:59.745 --> 39:02.589
<i>when they decided
to turn the case over</i>

39:02.673 --> 39:04.665
to the U.S. Marshall service.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.344
<i>- Neither the Anglin family
nor law enforcement</i>

39:07.503 --> 39:09.512
<i>has heard anything
from the escapees</i>

39:09.671 --> 39:11.264
<i>since the night
they pushed their raft</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:13.933
<i>off the shores of Alcatraz.</i>

39:14.018 --> 39:17.261
<i>But that hasn't
stopped the search.</i>

39:17.346 --> 39:19.606
- The investigation
is still ongoing today.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.100
<i>The authorities say
they will not close the case</i>

39:22.184 --> 39:24.944
<i>until they reach the age of 99.</i>

39:25.029 --> 39:28.689
<i>- I worked on this case
for 17 years until I retired.</i>

39:28.783 --> 39:30.691
<i>And every lead
that I ever followed</i>

39:30.776 --> 39:32.702
<i>turned out to be nothing.</i>

39:32.787 --> 39:35.455
<i>It turned out to be
dead-end on everything.</i>

39:35.614 --> 39:37.949
<i>There's a couple things that
I didn't really put out before</i>

39:38.033 --> 39:39.542
<i>but I'll put out right now is</i>

39:39.627 --> 39:40.877
they left at, like,
the worst time

39:40.961 --> 39:42.286
they could have left.

39:42.371 --> 39:43.880
<i>The currents at
10:00 that night</i>

39:43.964 --> 39:45.882
<i>just started
going out to the ocean</i>

39:45.966 --> 39:47.384
at an ever-increasing pace

39:47.468 --> 39:48.793
<i>up until midnight.</i>

39:48.877 --> 39:50.461
<i>And that's easily,</i>

39:50.546 --> 39:52.555
<i>easily enough time
for a three knot current</i>

39:52.714 --> 39:54.465
<i>to push them all the way out
into the ocean.</i>

39:54.558 --> 39:57.644
So if they had tried to paddle
towards Angel Island.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.479
<i>More than likely, they said,
"This isn't working.</i>

39:59.563 --> 40:02.473
<i>We're dumping the boat."
Boat went out to the ocean.</i>

40:02.558 --> 40:03.900
<i>And when that happened, that's
when the Anglin brothers</i>

40:04.059 --> 40:05.819
<i>lost their little packet
of information.</i>

40:05.903 --> 40:07.570
<i>Probably fell out
at the same time</i>

40:07.729 --> 40:09.739
<i>and they probably tried
to swim from that point</i>

40:09.824 --> 40:11.991
<i>'cause they were probably
in panic mode at this time</i>

40:12.151 --> 40:13.576
<i>'cause they knew they weren't
going towards Angel Island,</i>

40:13.735 --> 40:15.319
<i>they were going towards
the Golden Gate.</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:16.913
<i>And by now,
they're probably in the water</i>

40:17.072 --> 40:18.990
<i>for an hour so they're probably</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:20.491
<i>getting pretty cold
and they're starting to lose</i>

40:20.576 --> 40:22.160
<i>their functional time
from hypothermia,</i>

40:22.253 --> 40:23.828
And then they would've
finally succumbed to it

40:23.912 --> 40:26.840
and would've probably
sunk to the bottom.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.591
<i>So I can't ever say it 100%</i>

40:28.750 --> 40:31.335
because we don't have bodies
to prove they died.

40:31.420 --> 40:34.088
But I can say,
in all likelihood,

40:34.173 --> 40:36.340
they probably did not make it.

40:45.860 --> 40:48.686

40:50.856 --> 40:53.450
<i>You really don't have that
many leads, in my opinion,</i>

40:53.534 --> 40:57.120
unless some of 'em
were actually true.

40:57.279 --> 40:58.705
<i>- The scope of the investigation</i>

40:58.864 --> 41:00.114

<i>I mean, it was nationwide.</i>

41:01.950 --> 41:03.618
Thousands of leads
all around the country

41:03.702 --> 41:05.536

41:05.621 --> 41:09.549

41:13.378 --> 41:15.046
the day after they
couldn't find them, you know?

41:15.130 --> 41:16.222
"Hey, they drowned.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.466
They washed out to sea,
end of story."

41:18.550 --> 41:20.218
It was a big embarrassment.

41:20.302 --> 41:21.886
<i>If y'all really believed</i>

41:21.970 --> 41:24.314
<i>that they died

41:26.141 --> 41:28.318
<i>Why didn't you close the case?</i>

41:28.477 --> 41:32.146
So I really don't believe
