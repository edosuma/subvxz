LOUIE:
 <i>All right now, we got</i>
 <i>some cabs to get out here.</i>

00:54.234 --> 00:57.334
Ryan-- 1620.

00:57.367 --> 01:00.601
Arnie-- 214.

01:00.634 --> 01:02.868
Hey, cha-cha, get
out of that cab.

01:02.901 --> 01:04.400
Cavalucci-- 916.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.200
Wheeler-- 1136.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.200
Uh, skip Bobby.

01:09.234 --> 01:10.334
He isn't in yet.

01:10.367 --> 01:11.701
He isn't in yet?

01:11.734 --> 01:13.534
A <i>doctor</i> isn't in yet.

01:13.567 --> 01:15.167
A cabbie is late.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.400
It's all right.
He had a good excuse.

01:16.434 --> 01:19.601
I'll accept "dead."

01:19.634 --> 01:22.200
He had an important
audition this afternoon

01:22.234 --> 01:23.667
for an acting job.

01:23.701 --> 01:24.901
Hey, an audition.

01:24.934 --> 01:25.901
That's great.

01:25.934 --> 01:27.534
Well, not great.

01:27.567 --> 01:29.334
He had it this afternoon.
I figured he isn't in yet

01:29.367 --> 01:31.434
because he didn't get the part
and he's feeling depressed.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.067
Oh. The old shattered
dreams bit, huh?

01:34.100 --> 01:36.734
Well, if he thinks
he's depressed now,

01:36.767 --> 01:39.067
wait till I get through
with him.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.434
ALEX:
Hey, Bob.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.067
Wheeler. You're late

01:43.100 --> 01:46.367
and I don't want to
hear any lame excuses.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.901
I don't want to hear
about your other troubles.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.734
I got a garage to run here.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.501
Don't smile at me
when I'm yelling at you.

01:54.934 --> 01:56.567
What's the matter
with you?

01:56.601 --> 01:58.267
You on something?

01:58.300 --> 02:01.100
Why ain't he looking miserable?

02:01.133 --> 02:03.133
I got the job.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.200
You what?

02:04.234 --> 02:05.200
You got it?

02:05.234 --> 02:06.634
I got the part.

02:06.667 --> 02:08.533
They told me right there
at the audition.

02:08.567 --> 02:09.834
I'm gonna make two appearances

02:09.868 --> 02:11.767
on a soap opera
called <i>For Better For Worse.</i>

02:11.801 --> 02:12.767
Television?

02:12.801 --> 02:13.767
That is terrific.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.868
My man!

02:14.901 --> 02:17.033
Unbelievable.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
 <i>Bushgalay.</i>

02:22.801 --> 02:23.868
Being on a soap opera

02:23.901 --> 02:25.701
is not what I
always dreamed of,

02:25.734 --> 02:26.868
but it's a start.

02:26.901 --> 02:28.367
It's a chance to be seen.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.767
I can still work on my craft.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.400
I can still
develop my technique.

02:31.434 --> 02:33.734
And pick up a hell
of a lot of bread.

02:33.767 --> 02:35.067
Hey, when does this happen?

02:35.100 --> 02:36.868
I mean, when do we
get to see you?

02:36.901 --> 02:38.901
I make my first appearance
on Friday

02:38.934 --> 02:40.267
and then
I'm on again Tuesday,

02:40.300 --> 02:42.067
and then, like,
if things go real well

02:42.100 --> 02:43.701
I could maybe, well, you know...

02:43.734 --> 02:45.767
like, maybe it'll
go on longer, you know?

02:45.801 --> 02:47.167
You mean full-time?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.567
Well, I don't know yet.

02:48.601 --> 02:51.067
Let me tell you
the plot line, okay?

02:51.100 --> 02:52.734
I play this guy named Skip.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.734
I was a boyfriend
of the star's, right?

02:54.767 --> 02:56.901
We had this argument
four years ago

02:56.934 --> 02:59.734
and I left town mad,
only then I got amnesia

02:59.767 --> 03:02.167
and wandered around in a fog
somewhere the whole time,

03:02.200 --> 03:05.367
but now I'm recovered
and I'm coming back home.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.868
I just don't believe it.

03:07.901 --> 03:10.334
This is so exciting.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.667
Thrilling.

03:11.701 --> 03:13.000
Hey, Louie,
the least

03:13.033 --> 03:14.968
you can do is
congratulate the man.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.701
You got cab 1136.

03:17.734 --> 03:20.400
Congratulations.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.367
All right,
come on, you clowns.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.701
Let's get going here.

03:23.734 --> 03:26.200
Let's get some meat
behind the wheel.

03:26.234 --> 03:27.868
Bobby?

03:27.901 --> 03:30.367
I would like
to wish you bad luck.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.067
No. You mean
good luck, Latka.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.534
No, no. You see, in my country,

03:36.567 --> 03:39.901
it is bad luck
to wish a person good luck.

03:39.934 --> 03:43.400
So when we want
to wish a person good luck,

03:43.434 --> 03:45.000
we say "bad luck."

03:45.033 --> 03:47.067
Oh. That's
an interesting custom.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.234
Uh, what do you do

03:48.267 --> 03:50.868
when you want somebody
to have bad luck?

03:50.901 --> 03:53.834
We kick him in the <i>yatabe.</i>

04:00.267 --> 04:03.567
ANNOUNCER:
 <i>For Better For Worse</i>
will continue

04:03.601 --> 04:04.834
after this message.

04:04.868 --> 04:06.767
What do you think so far?

04:06.801 --> 04:08.334
You weren't in it.

04:08.367 --> 04:09.501
It's not over yet.

04:09.534 --> 04:11.467
You see, I'm on
after this commercial.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.767
What I meant was, what
do you think of the way

04:12.801 --> 04:14.367
they've been talking about me
throughout the whole show?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.534
They're giving me
a big buildup, right?

04:16.567 --> 04:18.534
It's neat just hearing
the name Skip

04:18.567 --> 04:19.934
and knowing it's you.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.033
I never thought I'd see the day

04:22.067 --> 04:25.200
when my cabbies
would be watching a TV show

04:25.234 --> 04:27.634
instead of out making big bucks.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.601
I'm ashamed.

04:29.634 --> 04:32.868
I can't help thinking
of all the people out there

04:32.901 --> 04:35.367
waiting for taxis
that ain't coming--

04:35.400 --> 04:38.868
all the old people,
and the sick, and the infirm,

04:38.901 --> 04:41.200
and the preggos.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.734
Boy, you know, that Olivia,
she's really a good actress.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.400
In that last scene where she
was supposed to be crying,

04:47.434 --> 04:49.000
those were real tears.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.567
She cries in every scene.

04:50.601 --> 04:53.567
She cries if she's happy,
she cries if she's sad,

04:53.601 --> 04:56.968
she cries if she doesn't
know if she's happy or sad.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.067
Hey, she's going to cry again.

04:59.100 --> 05:00.567
Turn up the sound.

05:00.601 --> 05:02.834
WOMAN:
Olivia, relax.

05:02.868 --> 05:04.334
You're as nervous
as a cat.

05:04.367 --> 05:07.000
I haven't seen Skip
in four years.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.501
I thought
I'd never see him again.

05:09.534 --> 05:11.167
Wouldn't you be nervous?

05:11.200 --> 05:13.601
There's so much
I have to tell him.

05:13.634 --> 05:15.901
You mean, about you and David?

05:15.934 --> 05:18.033
Hey, you can't feel guilty.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.701
You can't blame yourself
for what's happened.

05:21.734 --> 05:25.167
Skip's amnesia
wasn't your fault.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.300
OLIVIA:
I know.

05:27.334 --> 05:31.300
I just keep thinking
if we hadn't fought,

05:31.334 --> 05:33.467
all this would never
have happened.

05:34.567 --> 05:36.100
But it did happen

05:36.133 --> 05:38.701
and a lot has changed
in four years.

05:38.734 --> 05:42.801
Skip can't expect you to have
the same feelings for him.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.434
I suppose not.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.234
Unless...

05:49.734 --> 05:51.033
Unless what?

05:51.067 --> 05:52.567
Nothing.

05:52.601 --> 05:53.901
No, no. Go on.

05:53.934 --> 05:55.901
You were going to say

05:55.934 --> 05:59.934
unless I do have the
same feelings for him.

06:03.534 --> 06:06.467
Well... do you?

06:06.501 --> 06:10.300
( <i>sobbing:</i> )
I don't know.

06:10.334 --> 06:12.501
How can I tell
until I've seen him again?

06:12.534 --> 06:13.834
( <i>knock at door</i> )

06:13.868 --> 06:15.367
That's Skip now.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.634
Come in.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.634
Hello.

06:37.567 --> 06:39.467
Skip...

06:45.067 --> 06:49.200
Gee, what a heavy moment.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.701
Yeah, that was very
dramatic, you know?

06:51.734 --> 06:54.834
So, uh, you liked it then,
right?

06:54.868 --> 06:57.367
Liked it?

06:57.400 --> 06:59.734
Liked it?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.901
We loved it.

07:01.934 --> 07:03.067
Hey, how come

07:03.100 --> 07:05.267
they only let you say
one word?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.167
It makes it more
dramatic that way.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.334
This way everybody
will tune back on Monday

07:09.367 --> 07:10.767
to see what happens.

07:10.801 --> 07:11.834
What happens?

07:11.868 --> 07:13.000
I don't know yet.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.334
They actually don't get
back to us until Tuesday.

07:15.367 --> 07:18.000
I'm waiting for them
to deliver the script now

07:18.033 --> 07:19.667
so I can find out myself.

07:19.701 --> 07:20.968
Oh, wow.
Thanks, John.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.968
Hey, Bob, Bob.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.167
If she's falling
for you again,

07:23.200 --> 07:25.734
that means you get to do more
than just two shows, right?

07:25.767 --> 07:26.834
My agent says
that if they

07:26.868 --> 07:28.334
develop a thing
between her and me,

07:28.367 --> 07:30.334
I could get a season
out of it.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.434
Wouldn't that be great?

07:31.467 --> 07:33.801
I could save my money and wait
for a really good part.

07:33.834 --> 07:37.000
Oh, come on script.

07:37.033 --> 07:41.367
Hey, I don't want
to burst your bubble...

07:41.400 --> 07:43.033
but you think Olivia

07:43.067 --> 07:46.701
is going to dump
that David guy for you?

07:46.734 --> 07:48.901
No way.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.200
The girl is nuts about him.

07:52.234 --> 07:54.067
She even forgave him

07:54.100 --> 07:57.133
for having an affair
with her uncle.

07:58.234 --> 08:00.200
Hey Louie, are
you telling us

08:00.234 --> 08:02.567
that you watch this
show regularly?

08:02.601 --> 08:04.467
My mother watches it.

08:04.501 --> 08:05.801
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:05.834 --> 08:07.234
I'd make her turn it off

08:07.267 --> 08:10.834
only it's a half hour a day
I don't have to talk to her.

08:10.868 --> 08:11.934
Yap, yap, yap.

08:11.968 --> 08:13.501
MAN:
Bobby Wheeler?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.801
Over here.
Oh, boy, is that my script?

08:15.834 --> 08:17.200
Yep.
Oh, great.

08:17.234 --> 08:18.534
Just initial.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.200
I'm holding my future
in my hands.

08:26.701 --> 08:27.834
Well, come on--

08:27.868 --> 08:29.868
you going to tell
us what happens?

08:29.901 --> 08:32.833
I already told you
what's going to happen.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.833
I don't believe it.

08:36.868 --> 08:38.667
What? What? What? What?

08:38.701 --> 08:41.200
Read what Olivia says there.

08:41.234 --> 08:44.534
"Olivia, with tears
in her eyes:

08:44.567 --> 08:46.167
'I love Skip.'"

08:46.200 --> 08:48.701
She says she loves me.

08:49.734 --> 08:51.367
Look what it says over here.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.200
"Olivia, sobbing
incessantly:

08:53.234 --> 08:56.033
"'I knew it the instant
I saw him again--

08:56.067 --> 08:59.701
he's the only man in the
world I could ever love.'"

08:59.734 --> 09:01.200
Hey, Bobby, you're in!
You're in!

09:01.234 --> 09:02.133
Hey, fantastic!

09:02.167 --> 09:03.234
Let me see that.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.968
TONY:
That means you're going
to do more shows?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.033
A lot more.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.300
I'm going to be
a full-time actor.

09:08.334 --> 09:11.501
That's the first time in my life
I can say that.

09:11.534 --> 09:12.534
I'm an actor.

09:12.567 --> 09:15.868
You son of a gun, you did it.

09:17.868 --> 09:19.667
I made it, Alex.

09:19.701 --> 09:23.367
I made it out
of the garage.

09:23.400 --> 09:28.434
I hope your career
goes in the toilet.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.334
Thanks a lot,
Latka, really.

09:31.367 --> 09:32.501
See, in his country,

09:32.534 --> 09:34.434
they got this
strange custom...

09:34.467 --> 09:35.434
Don't explain.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.167
Hey, Louie.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.501
Hey, <i>Lou.</i>

09:38.534 --> 09:40.167
( <i>chuckles</i> )

09:40.200 --> 09:43.667
Here. I want you to keep this
as a remembrance of me.

09:43.701 --> 09:45.200
It's my hack license.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.534
Now you can show it
to all your friends

09:47.567 --> 09:49.734
and tell them,
"I knew him when."

09:49.767 --> 09:52.200
You better hang
on to it, Wheeler,

09:52.234 --> 09:54.701
'cause you're
going to need it

09:54.734 --> 09:57.534
when you come crawling
back in here.

09:57.567 --> 10:00.968
You got it all
wrong, Louie.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.601
When I walk out of those doors,
I ain't never coming back.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.467
Oh, you'll be back.

10:06.501 --> 10:08.367
They <i>all</i> come back.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.367
Only one guy
ever made it out

10:11.400 --> 10:14.868
in the whole history
of this garage

10:14.901 --> 10:17.367
and that was James Caan...

10:17.400 --> 10:19.334
and he'll be back.

10:21.267 --> 10:23.067
You're a loser, Wheeler.

10:23.100 --> 10:27.567
You always was,
and you always will be.

10:27.601 --> 10:28.834
Oh, yeah?

10:28.868 --> 10:29.734
Yeah.

10:50.434 --> 10:52.634
You'll be back, Wheeler...

10:53.634 --> 10:56.434
and when you come back,
I'll be waiting.

10:56.467 --> 10:59.033
Ooh, will I be waiting.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.167

( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

11:18.400 --> 11:20.033
( <i>on TV</i> ):
Wouldn't you be nervous?

11:20.067 --> 11:21.367
There's so much...

11:21.400 --> 11:23.200
What are you guys doing here?

11:23.234 --> 11:25.100
Why'd they have to come here.

11:25.133 --> 11:26.567
You can't feel guilty.

11:27.934 --> 11:29.267
You can't blame yourself.

11:29.300 --> 11:31.434
Surprise.

11:31.467 --> 11:33.501
Come on. It's freezing.

11:33.534 --> 11:34.901
How you doing, John?

11:34.934 --> 11:37.567
( For Better for Worse <i>theme</i>

11:37.601 --> 11:40.734
What are you guys
doing here anyway?

11:40.767 --> 11:42.400
Well, we were wondering

11:42.434 --> 11:45.167
why we didn't see you
around the garage

11:45.200 --> 11:46.701
for a couple
of weeks,

11:46.734 --> 11:49.000
and so we wondered
how you were.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.400
And where you were.

11:50.434 --> 11:53.067
We figure you've been busy
with the show.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.968
Yeah.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.601
Watching the show
I see, huh?

11:59.133 --> 12:01.367
Hey, Bobby,
if this is a bad time,

12:01.400 --> 12:03.601
we can leave
and come back later.

12:03.634 --> 12:06.267
Or not come back again.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.167
Listen, we realize

12:08.200 --> 12:09.467
things change.

12:09.501 --> 12:12.167
I mean, we realize that your
life is very different now

12:12.200 --> 12:14.400
and maybe there's
not enough room in it

12:14.434 --> 12:16.200
for a bunch of cabbies
like us.

12:16.234 --> 12:17.734
Is that why you guys
came over here?

12:17.767 --> 12:19.901
'Cause you thought I didn't want
to hang around anymore?

12:19.934 --> 12:21.234
Well, we didn't really
think that.

12:21.267 --> 12:22.467
Oh, yeah, you did.

12:22.501 --> 12:24.000
I didn't return
your phone calls,

12:24.033 --> 12:26.367
so you thought I got stuck up
or something, right?

12:26.400 --> 12:28.100
Why didn't you
return our calls?

12:28.133 --> 12:29.434
'Cause I didn't feel like it.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.567
Oh, well, that clears that up,
doesn't it?

12:32.767 --> 12:35.067
I didn't
feel like it

12:35.100 --> 12:38.367
because I was too depressed.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.200
Depressed? About what?

12:45.534 --> 12:48.400
OLIVIA:
Julia, you're the first one
I'm telling.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.400
Skip and I... Skip and I
are going to be married.

12:51.434 --> 12:52.734
Hey, married--
congratulations!

12:52.767 --> 12:53.901
Shh!
Shh!

12:53.934 --> 12:55.267
Olivia, I'm so
happy for you.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.267
I know it's
what you want.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.267
( <i>phone rings</i> )

12:58.300 --> 13:00.067
Hello?

13:00.100 --> 13:01.400
Yes, this is she.

13:01.434 --> 13:02.367
What?

13:02.400 --> 13:05.300
Oh, no!
Oh my God, no!

13:05.334 --> 13:06.300
Olivia, what is it?

13:06.334 --> 13:07.400
It's Skip.

13:07.434 --> 13:08.567
He's been rushed
to the hospital.

13:08.601 --> 13:09.901
He's had an accident.

13:09.934 --> 13:11.033
Accident?
When? How?

13:11.067 --> 13:12.100
What happened?

13:12.133 --> 13:13.100
When? How?

13:13.133 --> 13:14.567
What happened?

13:20.234 --> 13:22.901
( <i>sobbing:</i> )
Oh, no.

13:25.434 --> 13:30.467
Olivia... don't cry.

13:30.501 --> 13:34.801
I can't help it.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.334
I want... to...

13:37.367 --> 13:40.234
Shhh, don't try to talk.

13:41.601 --> 13:44.067
I have to.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.234
I have to.

13:46.267 --> 13:49.968
I have to.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.567
I... I... love you.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.601
Remember.

13:57.634 --> 13:59.901
It's going to be all right.

13:59.934 --> 14:01.167
You'll see.

14:01.200 --> 14:08.501
I'm... I'm just glad that...
we had time...

14:08.534 --> 14:12.701
Skip... Skip!

14:12.734 --> 14:17.400
Oh, God... no!

14:29.367 --> 14:32.033
He's dead.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.534
Skip's dead.

14:33.567 --> 14:36.234
No wonder you're depressed,
Bobby.

14:36.267 --> 14:37.667
Poor guy.

14:37.701 --> 14:40.167
Yeah, it doesn't seem fair.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.701
First amnesia and now this.

14:42.734 --> 14:44.367
He's talking about Bobby.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.367
Bobby?

14:46.400 --> 14:47.367
Bobby's young.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.067
Bobby's still got his health.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.167
What chance has Skip got?

14:55.467 --> 14:58.901
Oh, I'm really sorry, Bobby.

14:58.934 --> 15:00.968
If it makes you
feel any better,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
you really did
a beautiful job.

15:03.033 --> 15:04.234
Thanks.

15:04.267 --> 15:06.033
I take it you saw this coming?

15:06.067 --> 15:07.801
Yeah, they told me
two weeks ago.

15:07.834 --> 15:09.667
They said they liked my work
and everything,

15:09.701 --> 15:13.000
but figured Olivia needed
more tragedy in her life.

15:13.033 --> 15:18.100
Right, she hadn't had
a good cry in seconds.

15:18.133 --> 15:19.801
So when's the funeral?

15:29.067 --> 15:31.868
Anyway...

15:31.901 --> 15:35.234
That's why
I didn't call you guys.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.534
I just wasn't up to it,
you know?

15:38.567 --> 15:41.701
So, any idea what
you're going to do now?

15:41.734 --> 15:43.033
What else?

15:43.067 --> 15:45.200
I'm going to get a job.
I have to.

15:45.234 --> 15:46.901
So, fine,
come back to the garage.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.234
No way.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.367
I walked out of there
the conquering hero.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.901
What am I going to look like
if I come back now?

15:52.934 --> 15:55.601
You'll look like the rest of us.

15:55.634 --> 15:59.901
I just don't think,
I can do it, Alex.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.334
ALEX:
Why not?

16:02.367 --> 16:04.501
Oh, it's Louie,
isn't it?

16:04.534 --> 16:05.834
Mm-hmm.

16:05.868 --> 16:07.834
It sure is Louie.

16:07.868 --> 16:10.601
If I come back there now,
he is going to tear me apart

16:10.634 --> 16:12.100
in front
of the whole garage.

16:12.133 --> 16:13.234
So what, he's done that before.

16:13.267 --> 16:17.167
Yeah, but this time
he's got a right to.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.033
Maybe I should
just go back there

16:20.067 --> 16:23.033
and let him dance
all over my face

16:23.067 --> 16:24.934
and get it over with.

16:24.968 --> 16:26.901
Hey, look,
maybe it won't be

16:26.934 --> 16:28.334
so bad as you think.

16:28.367 --> 16:30.801
Look, I'll see you back
in the garage, okay?

16:30.834 --> 16:32.601
Hey, wait a minute.
It's coming back on.
Shh!

16:32.634 --> 16:34.767
OLIVIA:
Poor Skip.

16:34.801 --> 16:38.534
I didn't even get a chance
to tell him.

16:38.567 --> 16:40.501
Tell him what?

16:40.534 --> 16:43.901
I'm going to have
his baby.

16:43.934 --> 16:45.734
Way to go, Bobby.

16:56.734 --> 16:59.234
Hey, Louie, can I talk
to you for a minute?

16:59.267 --> 17:00.567
Sure, Alex.

17:00.601 --> 17:02.000
What's on your mind?

17:02.033 --> 17:03.334
Well, you know

17:03.367 --> 17:05.501
Bobby's run
into some rotten luck.

17:05.534 --> 17:08.166
I know. I saw the show.

17:08.200 --> 17:12.000
Har, har, har.

17:12.032 --> 17:15.334
Louie, Louie, look, you know,
acting is Bobby's dream.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.334
I mean, it's his soul.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.867
It's his reason
for living.

17:17.901 --> 17:19.867
You know, to have a dream
like that come true,

17:19.901 --> 17:21.467
to have it finally
within your grasp,

17:21.501 --> 17:22.666
and then to lose
it all again,

17:22.701 --> 17:24.867
do you have any idea
how he must feel?

17:24.901 --> 17:27.701
Like hell.

17:27.733 --> 17:28.868
Louie, Louie, listen,
listen to me.

17:28.901 --> 17:30.667
He's coming in
any minute.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.200
No kidding!

17:32.234 --> 17:35.067
Louie, all he wants is to have
his old job back.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.100
( <i>evil laughter</i> )

17:38.701 --> 17:40.534
Louie, Louie, Louie! <i>Louie!</i>

17:40.567 --> 17:42.834
Look, you just got to do
me one big favor, okay?

17:42.868 --> 17:44.434
Now, it's a very
hard thing

17:44.467 --> 17:46.767
for Bobby to come
back here like this.

17:46.801 --> 17:50.000
So please, don't make him feel
any worse than he does, okay?

17:50.033 --> 17:54.067
Ooh, am I going to love this.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.534
I am going to love it.

17:55.567 --> 17:57.367
Louie, come here. Sit down.

17:57.400 --> 17:58.734
Please, sit down.

18:00.901 --> 18:03.601
I don't know how
to get through to you.

18:03.634 --> 18:04.934
Look, um...

18:04.968 --> 18:07.834
Look, we all know each other
very well in this garage, right?

18:07.868 --> 18:10.834
We know you and how you act,
and we all accept that,

18:10.868 --> 18:13.000
but this is something
very special.

18:13.033 --> 18:15.033
Now I'm asking you the best way
I know how--

18:15.067 --> 18:16.634
When Bobby walks
through that door,

18:16.667 --> 18:18.267
please, just leave him alone.
Okay?

18:18.300 --> 18:21.601
You really mean this,
don't you?

18:21.634 --> 18:22.801
Yes, I do.

18:24.868 --> 18:28.834
Well then, I guess there's only
one thing I can say.

18:28.868 --> 18:31.601
Blow it out your ear,
Rieger!

18:32.734 --> 18:35.167
When Wheeler
walks through that door

18:35.200 --> 18:37.133
I am going to give it to him

18:37.167 --> 18:39.734
like I have never given it
to nobody.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.367
( <i>grunts</i> )

18:42.734 --> 18:46.000
I am going to rub
his nose in it.

18:46.033 --> 18:50.167
I am going to make him squeal
like an eel

18:50.200 --> 18:52.567
and squirm like a worm.

18:52.601 --> 18:53.868
That does it, Louie!

18:53.901 --> 18:55.534
You just got me angry.

18:55.567 --> 18:56.601
Ooh, I'm trembling

18:56.634 --> 18:57.667
in my booties.

18:57.701 --> 18:58.801
Well, you better tremble

18:58.834 --> 19:00.534
because you've just gone
too far.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.968
You think humiliating
people is fun, don't you?

19:03.000 --> 19:05.267
You think you're pretty cute
this way, don't you?

19:05.300 --> 19:06.133
I am cute.

19:06.167 --> 19:07.234
No, you're not
cute, Louie,

19:07.267 --> 19:08.300
and you're not clever.

19:08.334 --> 19:09.901
It's not hard
to humiliate people.

19:09.934 --> 19:10.968
It's not hard to make

19:11.000 --> 19:12.667
people feel rotten
about their lives.

19:12.701 --> 19:14.801
The difficult thing
is to make people feel good

19:14.834 --> 19:17.133
about their lives.
Humiliating them, that's simple.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.300
I'll show you how simple it is.
Here, take a look at this.

19:18.334 --> 19:19.868
Simple, huh?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.968
What the hell
are you doing?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.100
I was just giving you
a lesson, Louie,

19:26.133 --> 19:29.167
on how easy it is to make people
feel ridiculous.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.467
You see that?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.334
You're crazy!

19:34.367 --> 19:36.000
The man is crazy!

19:36.033 --> 19:37.200
He's a whack!

ALEX:
Louie, come here!

19:40.534 --> 19:41.868
Ha-ha-ha!

19:41.901 --> 19:44.634
Your friend, Wheeler,
is a loser, Rieger

19:44.667 --> 19:47.300
and I'm going to tell him
he's a loser

19:47.334 --> 19:49.534
and I'm going
to love telling him

19:49.567 --> 19:50.534
he's a loser.

19:50.567 --> 19:51.534
* He's a loser 

19:51.567 --> 19:54.033
* He's a loser 

19:54.067 --> 19:55.534
* Nyah, nyah, nyah 

19:55.567 --> 19:58.534
* He's a loser, he's a loser 

19:58.567 --> 20:00.400
* He's a loser 

20:00.434 --> 20:01.901
* He's a loser... 

20:13.767 --> 20:16.968
You're not finished yet?

20:17.000 --> 20:18.767
Louie, I'm warning you--

20:18.801 --> 20:21.901
Don't screw around with Bobby,
you hear me?

20:21.934 --> 20:24.567
What do you mean,
you're warning me?

20:24.601 --> 20:27.567
Are you threatening me
with physical violence, Alex?

20:27.601 --> 20:29.901
I'm not saying
it won't work.

20:29.934 --> 20:32.434
I just want to know.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.367
No, I'm not threatening you.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.501
Well, do you got
something on me?

20:37.534 --> 20:39.033
Are you
blackmailing me?

20:39.067 --> 20:41.868
I'm just telling you this
very simply, Louie.

20:41.901 --> 20:44.901
Don't do what you're thinking
of doing to Bobby.

20:44.934 --> 20:46.033
Just don't do it.

20:46.067 --> 20:47.400
Oh, yeah?

20:47.434 --> 20:49.033
Why not?

20:49.067 --> 20:51.567
Because...

20:51.601 --> 20:54.934
you shouldn't.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.868
I shouldn't?

21:02.901 --> 21:04.300
That's the reason
I shouldn't?

21:04.334 --> 21:07.367
I shouldn't?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.067
I shouldn't?

21:10.901 --> 21:12.200
I shouldn't!

21:12.234 --> 21:14.534
Oh, no, no, no, no!

21:14.567 --> 21:16.100
I shouldn't.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.868
I shouldn't!

21:19.901 --> 21:22.200
You shouldn't, you shouldn't!

21:22.234 --> 21:23.567
I shouldn't.

21:37.934 --> 21:40.200
( <i>evil laughter</i> )

21:46.667 --> 21:48.868
Nice having you back, Bobby.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.634
Hey, Louie.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.534
Listen, I got to tell you,

22:10.567 --> 22:14.567
I was really knocked out
when I came in here yesterday

22:14.601 --> 22:16.634
and you were so nice to me.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.033
Yeah?

22:18.067 --> 22:19.701
Yeah. I want to tell you,
I really appreciate it.

22:19.734 --> 22:23.267
I thought you were
going to dump on me

22:23.300 --> 22:26.300
and say things
like, uh... "Well.

22:26.334 --> 22:29.033
"If it isn't
the big movie star.

22:29.067 --> 22:32.067
"Come back
to sign autographs?

22:32.100 --> 22:36.234
"You got a movie
contract yet, bigshot?

22:36.267 --> 22:42.033
"Ooh, ooh, why, you look
just like the poor slob

22:42.067 --> 22:44.467
"who walked out of here
a few weeks ago

22:44.501 --> 22:47.133
swearing he was never
going to come back."

22:47.167 --> 22:50.567
( <i>evil laughter</i> )

22:55.267 --> 22:57.501
"What a loser!"

22:57.534 --> 22:58.567
You like that?

22:58.601 --> 23:01.334
Ooh-- oh, Bobby.

23:01.367 --> 23:05.033
I wouldn't have said
no things like that.

23:05.067 --> 23:10.367
Naw. But I probably
 <i>would</i> have said

23:10.400 --> 23:14.033
"Here comes the great ac-tor

23:14.067 --> 23:18.868
"bringing his aura
into our crummy garage.

23:18.901 --> 23:24.033
"I'm glad they finally found
a role worthy of your talents--

23:24.067 --> 23:25.734
A stiff!"

23:25.767 --> 23:30.701
And then I might have
turned on the PA like this

23:30.734 --> 23:34.100
and I might have said,
"Hey, everybody

23:34.133 --> 23:37.567
"you remember Bobby Wheeler
when he was a nobody?

23:37.601 --> 23:43.567
"Then you won't have any
problems recognizing him now.

23:43.601 --> 23:44.767
"Come on.

23:44.801 --> 23:46.734
"Gather 'round and see

23:46.767 --> 23:52.033
how a famous actor
eats crow."

23:52.067 --> 23:57.767
But I guess I'm just
too nice a guy for that.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.834
Yeah, well, thanks a lot

23:59.868 --> 24:01.334
for not doing that, Louie.

24:01.367 --> 24:03.100
Don't mention it.
