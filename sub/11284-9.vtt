HE'D ACTUALLY GO.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.956
HE CALLED FROM
MY FATHER'S HOUSE

19:51.958 --> 19:53.758
A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.626
SAID HE WOULD GO
TO THE COUNSELING,

19:55.628 --> 19:58.863
BUT THAT HE NEEDED
HIS SPACE FOR A WHILE.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.265
WHICH WAS PROBABLY
JUST AS WELL...

20:01.267 --> 20:03.367
THAT HE DIDN'T COME HOME?
WHY?

20:03.369 --> 20:05.469

I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM TOO,
BUT I DON'T.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.282

YEAH.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.119
WHAT'S THE POINT?

34:16.121 --> 34:18.588
IF YOU TELL THE TRUTH,

34:18.590 --> 34:21.158
<i> IT CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.</i>

34:22.094 --> 34:25.095
IF YOU COULD LOSE SOMEONE...

THE TEAM SUCCEEDED,
EDDIE;

36:13.305 --> 36:15.739
THAT'S WHAT

36:16.775 --> 36:19.176
(AUDITORIUM DOORS OPEN)

36:20.212 --> 36:21.912
MR. HEWSON.

36:21.914 --> 36:23.897
CARL:
THIS IS TIME-SENSITIVE,

36:23.898 --> 36:25.881
HE NEEDS POSITIVE AFFIRMATION
BEFORE HE BACKSLIDES.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.617
(IRATE, HEAVY BREATHS)

36:27.619 --> 36:29.753
YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM MY GRANDSON.

36:29.755 --> 36:31.922
HE NEARLY DIED TODAY
BECAUSE OF YOU.

36:31.924 --> 36:33.890
HE SURVIVED BECAUSE OF ME.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.542
HE CHOSE TO LIVE

36:35.543 --> 36:37.193
BECAUSE I SHOWED HIM
THE RIGHT ROAD.

36:37.196 --> 36:37.928
IF HE REALLY HAD
OF BEEN GAY,

36:37.930 --> 36:40.463
HE WOULD'VE KILLED HIMSELF.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.399
WHICH, BETWEEN US...

36:42.401 --> 36:44.301
IS THAT WHAT YOU TEACH?

36:44.303 --> 36:46.403
IF YOU'RE GAY,
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST DIE?

36:46.405 --> 36:48.305
<i>YOU'RE GONNA SHOW</i>
<i>SOME RESPECT.</i>

36:48.307 --> 36:49.540
OKAY, MR. HEWSON...

36:49.541 --> 36:50.774
HOW MANY KIDS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO FALL OVER THE EDGE

36:50.776 --> 36:52.475
BEFORE SOMEONE STOPS YOU?

36:52.477 --> 36:53.777
I'M KEEPING FAMILIES
TOGETHER.

36:53.779 --> 36:54.945
I LOST MY OWN SON-

36:54.947 --> 36:57.881
NO. YOUR SON LOST A FATHER.

BE WHO HE IS,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.901
<i> TELL IT LIKE IT IS...</i>

37:18.837 --> 37:21.404
NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT.
I COULDN'T.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.940
YOU'RE RIGHT, ARTHUR,
THE TRUTH TAKES COURAGE.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.926
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:25.927 --> 37:27.911
I COULD'VE JUST OPENED
MY MOUTH ONCE

37:27.913 --> 37:29.579
AND SAID SOMETHING.

AND SHE'S GONNA SEE ME.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.515
AND THEN WHAT?

39:13.452 --> 39:16.453
YOU THINK THAT SHE'S
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.520
WELL, SHE'S NOT.
