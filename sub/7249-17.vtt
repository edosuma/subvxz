00:03.462 --> 00:06.798
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.801
I'm tired of this ridiculous machine.
I get it every time...

00:09.843 --> 00:10.969
That was close.

00:11.053 --> 00:13.430
...Rory are always out.
What is it that you do?

00:13.514 --> 00:16.808
Is your house that awful you can't be in it?
It's too much excitement.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.769
What isn't in Emily's rules of conduct?

00:18.852 --> 00:21.146
I don't want to talk to a machine.
Call you later.

00:21.188 --> 00:25.234
If you had your way, you'd lock us up
like veal. You want veal children.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.320
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

00:28.403 --> 00:31.114
- It's me again...
- You are talking to a machine.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.825
...don't forget that
my DAR meeting's on Tuesday...

00:33.867 --> 00:36.161
It's burned into my brain.
It's there forever.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.497
...and the women
are all extremely punctual.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.834
When I'm senile and gaga
and drooling into a cup...

00:42.042 --> 00:43.961
and I can't remember my name...

00:44.044 --> 00:47.631
I'll still remember
that your DAR meeting is that Tuesday.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.008
I'll talk to you
about some other things later.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.469
I'd have to be deprogrammed
by cult deprogrammers...

00:52.553 --> 00:54.847
to get that Tuesday out of my brain.

00:54.888 --> 00:58.350
We're not in, so...
Bashed my thumb. Leave a message.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.353
- Your phone message is annoying...
- Unbelievable.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.105
...you know how annoying it is?

01:03.188 --> 01:06.024
I think I have a standard
against which to measure it.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.484
...you heard it lately?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.611
Can't because I'm amputating my ears.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.865
...don't say your name.
That thumb bashing thing, is that a joke?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.867
Why is that your jokes are always...

01:14.950 --> 01:17.244
An earless world, what a dream.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074

02:16.345 --> 02:19.932
Haven't you already tasted
that soup twice, Mom?

02:20.015 --> 02:22.559
- You keeping a running count?
- I'm morbidly fascinated.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.396
When you're tasting anything,
the first taste acclimates the palate...

02:26.480 --> 02:29.900
the second establishes a foundation,
the third is to make your decision.

02:29.983 --> 02:33.237
- Gonna be a third one.
- Isn't it what this is for, to taste the soup?

02:33.320 --> 02:36.031
Taste, yes. Not to orally deduce
their chemical structures.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.574
Everything has to be at your pace.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.537
A pace that can't be measured by the
number of times the earth circles the sun.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.038
- Actually, I've heard that.
- What?

02:43.121 --> 02:46.250
One is to acclimate, two is for foundation,
and three is to judge.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.419
- Traitor.
- The women in my group are very picky.

02:49.586 --> 02:53.173
When the paté at the meeting
Heddy Covington organized...

02:53.257 --> 02:56.426
was less chilled than appropriate,
she was ostracized for a month.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.887
- That hussy Heddy had it coming.
- Lorelai.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.306
They're on time for once. Good.

03:01.348 --> 03:04.726
- Do me a favor and tell Michel that...
- Lorelai, please.

03:04.810 --> 03:05.978
Thanks.

03:06.854 --> 03:11.191
I got a lot of other things happening.
They can't come to a grinding halt for this.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.152
Your full attention for a short period
is too much to ask for?

03:14.194 --> 03:18.532
I'm giving you more attention than I would
someone in these circumstances.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.995
No one else would get eight separate
soups to taste for a lousy DAR... Sorry.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.123
A not-lousy DAR meeting.
We only do this for weddings.

03:26.206 --> 03:30.669
- Would you like me to pay for the tasting?
- No, just decide in this calendar year.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.504
Can I... I'm sorry.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.175
The mushroom is a great choice.
It's super-popular...

03:36.258 --> 03:38.594
and it's my Jackson's favorite.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.597
- Whose?
- Jackson, my fiancé.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.516
- You're getting married?
- To the best man in the world.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.768
While we're on the subject,
bridesmaids' outfits.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.188
I'm way ahead of you.
Already got a couple of ideas.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.315
Is one of them having me design
and make them...

03:51.398 --> 03:55.194
so I don't secretly hate what you pick
and harbor a secret grudge against you?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.653
- It is now.
- I'll do it.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.905
We're a good team.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.490
That fellow's on the phone
from the restaurant.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.035
- Who?
- The flannel man with protruding ankles.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.246
I forgot his name from the desk to here.
That's how memorable he is.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.456
Okay, thank you.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.333
- Where are you going?
- To talk to Luke.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.668
- Can't you call him back?
- Have your third taste.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.047
Lorelai! Is she always this scattered?

04:15.255 --> 04:18.550
- She's the stablest person I know.
- That's very sad.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.555
- I think you're right. Mushroom.
- Great.

04:23.639 --> 04:27.935
- Tell me more about your wedding.
- Just started planning, not much to tell.

04:28.018 --> 04:32.231
Have you decided on anything yet?
Location or the music for the ceremony?

04:32.356 --> 04:35.400
We'll probably just wind up playing
something off a CD.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.945
What?

04:38.028 --> 04:41.615
CD's can be very unreliable.
They break sometimes or they skip...

04:41.698 --> 04:44.868
or the person assigned
to turn them on and off gets distracted...

04:44.952 --> 04:46.912
and the whole ceremony is ruined.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.374
- I hadn't thought of that.
- Have you thought about live music?

04:50.457 --> 04:53.585
- A nice string ensemble.
- That sounds nice.

04:53.669 --> 04:56.547
There are a couple of wonderful groups
I could recommend.

04:56.630 --> 05:00.259
- Sure. It doesn't hurt to check them out.
- No, it doesn't.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.350
- Mushroom soup.
- String quartet.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.480
- Luke?
- Yeah. Hi.

05:13.564 --> 05:16.942
- How's it going?
- Pretty good. How's things with you?

05:17.067 --> 05:20.612
Not bad. Dropped some eggs.
Hazard of the business.

05:20.696 --> 05:24.533
- Am I catching you at a bad time?
- No, it's kind of slow here.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.578
So slow that Michel and I
were about to get the tetherball out.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.663
The thing with the ball tethered to a rope?

05:29.746 --> 05:32.082
I never knew that's where
the tether comes from.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.127
Yeah, it's tied like an anchor
is tethered to a rope on a boat.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.253
Neat.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.464
- Most people don't put that together.
- Probably not.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.635
- So anything else?
- Yeah, actually.

05:43.677 --> 05:48.265
If I needed a room or two
for a couple of days, would it be possible?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.475
- You need rooms?
- Like, nine.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.520
- You need nine rooms?
- Just for a couple of days.

05:53.604 --> 05:57.482
- Wednesday and Thursday.
- I can take care of that. What's it for?

05:57.566 --> 06:01.278
- I just got some family coming in.
- Reunion? We can get the tetherball out.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.322
- No, funeral.
- What?

06:03.655 --> 06:08.118
Yeah, my uncle Louie died last night,
and I'm arranging the funeral for him.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.623
Luke, I'm so sorry.
Here I was babbling about tetherball.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.292
- You weren't babbling.
- You've got nine rooms.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.127
- Wednesday and Thursday.
- You sure?

06:17.211 --> 06:18.837
- It's a done deal.
- Thanks.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.672
I'm so sorry.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.759
It's okay. It sounds like he went peaceful.
He was 85.

06:23.842 --> 06:27.179
But it's always hard. You okay?

06:27.471 --> 06:30.516
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Can I help you with anything else?

06:30.599 --> 06:32.392
No, the rooms are help enough.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.770
Are you sure?
'Cause, I'm dealing with my mom now...

06:34.853 --> 06:37.231
and I'd be happy to rush over
and help with whatever.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.482
You'd be doing me a favor.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.067
The rooms are all I need. Thanks.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.361
- You're welcome.
- I got to go.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.030
- Call if you need anything.
- I will.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.658
That French guy is a putz.

06:47.866 --> 06:50.452
- Yeah. He knows.
- All right. See ya.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.578
Bye.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.042
- It's so sad.
- I know.

06:57.793 --> 07:00.045
Was Luke shaken over his uncle dying?

07:00.087 --> 07:02.589
I don't know. He's so unflappable.
It's hard to tell.

07:02.673 --> 07:05.175
The man definitely can't be flapped.

07:24.278 --> 07:26.488
- Can I get another cup of coffee?
- In a minute.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.365
- Is that my food?
- More coffee here, too.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.033
- In a minute.
- Is that my food?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.035
- More coffee for me, too.
- Shut up, Kirk.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.871
- Is that my food?
- Yes, that's your food.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.956
- Can I have it?
- I'm doing all I can, folks.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.875
- I asked nicely.
- Watch the cord.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.460
- Try ducking.
- You should update to a cordless.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.046
- What are you doing?
- Thanks. I'm on the phone.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.424
- We noticed.
- I can't serve and be on the phone.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.550
We noticed that, too.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.928
Your reenactment of Jerry Lewis
in The Diner Guy will wow the critics.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.264
- Where do the poached eggs go?
- Crank in the hat.

07:52.306 --> 07:55.100
- I'm not a crank. You are a crank.
- He is a crank.

07:55.184 --> 07:58.604
- And the French toast?
- The lady with the giant purse.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.648
- This is not good.
- Fall back, cowboy.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.275
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.110
Stay on the phone and give me these.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.154
- Where do they go?
- Table by the window.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.739
- Don't you number your tables?
- No.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.240
You should number your tables.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.243
If I said a number, you wouldn't know
what table's what number.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.496
- But all restaurants number their tables.
- They go to table five.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.874
- Cool. Which one is that?
- The table by the window.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.918
- By the window, Wilma.
- Got it, Gertie.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.128
- How about that coffee?
- I got it.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.421
Thanks.

08:24.755 --> 08:28.759
But mine's a quarter caf. Three-fourths
decaf, one-fourth caffeinated.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.094
- And four-fourths don't care.
- Fill it up.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.471
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.182
The world's full of people
who micromanage their lives...

08:35.265 --> 08:37.601
to the point where they can't wait
an extra second.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.977
- We're running out of coffee.
- I'll make some more.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.605
- No, I got it.
- Do you know how?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.024
Do I? I'm Cathy Coffee, mister...

08:44.107 --> 08:46.693
the bastard offspring
of Mrs. Folger and Juan Valdez.

08:46.777 --> 08:48.487
- Where's Jess?
- I don't know.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.822
- School?
- Please. Probably upstairs.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.533
Really? Excuse me.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.076
- It's too strong.
- It's not.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.662
- You're on the phone.
- Not everyone likes it strong.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.374
Then I shall convert them.
I'm the Jehovah's coffee girl.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.759
Jess, open up. I know you're in there.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.512
Aren't we bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.305
- Luke needs you downstairs.
- Why?

09:15.389 --> 09:18.976
He's on the phone, Caesar's off today,
the place is packed. He needs help.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.687
- I'll be down in a minute.
- No. Now.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.230
I'm in the middle of something.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.650
Assume that Jeanie's gonna get
Major Healey out of whatever he's in.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.360
Thanks for spoiling it for me.

09:30.946 --> 09:33.323
- I need some more Equal.
- There's one right there.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.449
I need seven.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.287
You're not squirreling these away
in your pocket for home use, are you?

09:38.370 --> 09:42.708
- No, I use seven in my coffee.
- Okay. Good. Then allow me.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.839
There you go.
Go ahead and give that a taste.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.341
- See if it's to your liking.
- Okay.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.431
- Perfection.
- Good.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.059
- You're very graceful.
- She pushed me.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.853
- Sue me.
- I could've broken my neck.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.981
As long as it's not your arm.
We need your arm.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.526
Despot.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.489
It took me 20 minutes to get past
this place's busy signal...

10:14.573 --> 10:17.409
- then they put me on hold forever.
- Who's keeping you on hold?

10:17.492 --> 10:19.494
That mortuary in Florida
where my uncle's at.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.038
I thought he was in the area.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.249
He spent most of his life here
but retired to Orlando.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.460
So I got to ship the body back here.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.337
He wanted to be buried in Stars Hollow?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.632
No. My dad wanted my uncle buried
here right next to him.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.925
That's nice.

10:32.966 --> 10:36.428
They were close, and Louie didn't have
a family to look out for things.

10:36.470 --> 10:39.056
Before my dad died,
he asked me if I'd look out for him.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.140
Good Louie.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.518
He wanted me to make sure
he got a proper funeral.

10:42.601 --> 10:45.229
- Respectful, dignified.
- No horseshoe carnation wreaths.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.022
Got it. Good man, that dad of yours.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.774
And since Louie's a war veteran...

10:48.815 --> 10:52.569
the town Revolutionary War re-enactors
will attend the service...

10:52.653 --> 10:54.238
do the salute thing.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.990
It makes me nauseous,
but my dad wanted it.

10:57.074 --> 10:59.076
Yeah. Hi. I'm still here.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.621
Yes, the deceased is Louie Danes. Right.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.834
No, Hartford's not too far.
I can do that. Thanks.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.087
Great. That's done. Okay.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.131
I should probably go
pick out a coffin before he gets here.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.258
Great. Go.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.301
- I have to close up.
- No. You're covered.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.137
- You don't have to do this.
- We don't mind. Go.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.641
- Gives me a chance to number the tables.
- Be my guest.

11:22.766 --> 11:25.352
Are they arranged like this
for any particular reason?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.855
- Don't change anything.
- It's totally not Feng Shui.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.314
- Gertie.
- Go.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.493
Excuse me, Taylor,
where are your Brussels sprouts?

11:41.535 --> 11:44.872
My supplier was out of them this week,
Mrs. Cassini. Maybe next week.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.040
- I wanted to make them tonight.
- Sorry.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.751
Okay. I'll just try across the street.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.254
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.591
Across the street?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.846
What is that?

12:00.971 --> 12:04.224
It's a farmer's market. Isn't it wonderful?

12:04.349 --> 12:07.811
It just opened this morning,
and I see sprouts.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.567
Who's the proprietor here?

12:13.650 --> 12:15.861
That would be me. What can I do for you?

12:15.944 --> 12:17.988
Wait a minute. I know you.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.366
You're that long-haired freak
that wanted to be town troubadour...

12:21.450 --> 12:25.579
even though that weird brown-corduroyed-
jacket-wearing freak was already it.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.664
That's right. Good memory. How are you?

12:27.748 --> 12:30.292
- Let go of me.
- Don't like to be touched. That's cool.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.795
Got a David and Lisa thing happening.
Made a mental note. No problem.

12:33.879 --> 12:34.880
Can I help you?

12:34.963 --> 12:37.841
I want to know what inspired you
to open a produce stand...

12:37.925 --> 12:40.093
right across the street from my market?

12:40.177 --> 12:42.846
- Is that your market?
- Yes, that's my market.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.724
It's real nice. Homey.
Bought a box of tissues there.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.726
Good stuff.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.394
Excuse me.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.773
Your parsley,
is it priced per bunch or per pound?

12:52.856 --> 12:55.025
- Per pound, beautiful.
- Good deal.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.402
- Patty.
- Hi, Taylor. How are you?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.072
You mean not counting
the knife sticking in my back?

13:00.155 --> 13:01.990
Sure, honey, whatever.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.910
There must be some mistake.
This just isn't right.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.788
It's approved by the proper authorities.
I followed the rules.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.500
It's what Dad taught me. Cop for 20 years,
got shot in the butt. Good man.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.877
Tips over sometimes when he sits,
but good man.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.755
- Beautiful sprouts.
- For a beautiful lady.

13:17.673 --> 13:18.924
Thank you.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.718
- I feel sick.
- That'll be $4.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.971
- See you, Mr. Doose.
- I want to lie down.

13:24.888 --> 13:28.767
Lorelai, good. Tell me
about the nine rooms set aside here...

13:28.809 --> 13:33.146
there's no name anywhere that I can see,
and no credit card to hold them. Mistake?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.940
- No, it's for Luke.
- For whom?

13:35.023 --> 13:38.694
- Luke from Luke's diner.
- Nine rooms for Luke from Luke's diner.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.613
- French Fry convention?
- No, just personal.

13:41.697 --> 13:45.033
- Milkshake symposium?
- No, it's personal. I'm vouching for him.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.077
- Soda pop seminar?
- Stop.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.789
- Pickle party?
- He's got nine rooms. Now stifle.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.377
- Mom, hi there.
- Lorelai, hello.

13:55.460 --> 13:59.298
I'm sorry. Did we get our signals crossed?
I don't have an appointment with you.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.550
We have to make appointments
to see each other?

14:01.633 --> 14:04.970
- No. But... good one.
- I'm not here to see you.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.890
- This isn't about the DAR meeting?
- No, that's ready to go.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.017
- I'm here to meet with Sookie.
- Sookie?

14:10.100 --> 14:13.812
I'm a little late. Traffic was awful.
Excuse me, would you?

14:19.610 --> 14:21.486
- Oh, my God.
- Aren't they beautiful?

14:21.570 --> 14:23.488
- Gorgeous. What are they for?
- My wedding.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.741
- Your wedding?
- Emily, hi!

14:25.824 --> 14:28.285
- Is this everything I said it was?
- And more.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.204
What do you mean
they're for your wedding?

14:30.287 --> 14:33.457
It's this company's sample place setting.
Emily set me up with them.

14:33.499 --> 14:36.627
They did Celine Dion's wedding
and Steven Spielberg's daughter's...

14:36.710 --> 14:40.547
- Jack Russell Terrier's 'bark' mitzvah.
- You're putting me on.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.216
I couldn't make that up.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.844
Excuse me. This one's slightly
asymmetrical. Fix, please.

14:46.136 --> 14:50.599
What is with the fancy place settings?
I thought you were gonna keep it simple.

14:50.682 --> 14:51.683
It is simple.

14:51.767 --> 14:54.353
- It lights up.
- Just flip a switch. Simple.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.940
- How did my mother get so involved?
- She's not that involved.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.984
She just mentioned the other day
that she knew some people...

15:01.068 --> 15:05.030
that could make samples of stuff for us,
like table settings, flower arrangements.

15:05.113 --> 15:08.659
- We were gonna do the flowers ourselves.
- But what a hassle that would be.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.702
It's to save money. Flowers cost a lot.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.455
But the sampling
of what they're doing today is free.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.707
- I'm not committed to any of this.
- I hope not.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.960
It's true. I say no, it all goes away.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.545
- Not a penny is spent.
- Okay.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.381
- And it's fun.
- I don't want to take away your fun.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.884
I just want you to be careful.
You've entered 'Emily-land. '

15:26.552 --> 15:29.513
It's an upside-down world
where the Horchow house is low-rent...

15:29.555 --> 15:32.391
and diamonds less than 24 carats
are Cracker Jack trinkets...

15:32.474 --> 15:34.935
and Bentleys are for losers
who can't afford a Rolls.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.895
- But I'm okay. Really.
- All right.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.398
I have to help Luke with the lunch rush,
so I gotta go.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.068
- Go. We're fine.
- Okay. Bye, Mom.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.531
Is that a fingerprint? My god!
That's a fingerprint! Who touched this?

15:47.573 --> 15:48.824
Let me see your hands.

15:49.491 --> 15:51.743
Turnips, butternut...

15:52.452 --> 15:54.788
- Turnips.
- What?

15:54.872 --> 15:57.541
- What about turnips?
- Why did you say 'turnips?'

15:57.583 --> 15:59.501
- Because you said 'turnips. '
- No, I didn't.

15:59.585 --> 16:03.297
- I think you did.
- No, but I've got turnips. Good ones, too.

16:03.422 --> 16:07.968
They're not as big as that crinite freak's,
but who needs bloated turnips?

16:08.051 --> 16:12.055
Mine are unassuming.
I have nice, humble turnips.

16:12.139 --> 16:13.515
Okey-dokey.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.560
Taylor's wigging.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.938
He's been sitting there like the final days
of Dick Nixon for an hour.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.773
Keep an eye on him.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.945
- Hello, there. How's it going?
- Very good, young lady.

16:26.987 --> 16:30.073
- Still serving breakfast?
- We serve it all day. What'll you have?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.284
- Two eggs up on toast.
- Up, huh?

16:32.367 --> 16:34.578
- Yeah.
- Wouldn't you rather have scrambled?

16:34.620 --> 16:37.748
- Nope, up's how I like them.
- Scrambled's better. Give it a shot.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.167
Say you want two scrambled eggs
on toast, please.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.003
Okay, young lady.
Two scrambled eggs on toast.

16:44.213 --> 16:47.925
Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck 'em.
That's real live diner talk.

16:47.966 --> 16:51.053
- The 'wreck 'em' is the scrambled part.
- I deduced that.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.972
- I don't believe it.
- What's the matter?

16:54.056 --> 16:56.975
That's Babette with an armload
of rutabaga.

16:57.017 --> 17:01.188
And there's Miss Patty again.
Since when does she eat so much fruit?

17:02.731 --> 17:04.316
- Hi, Kirk.
- Hello.

17:04.398 --> 17:07.236
- Where's Luke?
- He's busy with some stuff...

17:07.319 --> 17:09.530
so Rory and I are helping out.
What can I get you?

17:09.613 --> 17:12.031
I want lunch, but I'm not sure what to get.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.493
I have a suggestion: A hamburger
with some strawberry ice cream...

17:15.577 --> 17:17.746
- with chocolate sauce for dessert?
- Sounds good.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.833
Yo, burn one, then pass me a pink stick
and throw some mud on it!

17:20.915 --> 17:22.667
God, I love this business.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.212
Boy, it's freezing out there.

17:25.295 --> 17:29.007
Yes, it's quite a cold snap.
How about a hot blonde with sand?

17:29.049 --> 17:32.094
Coffee with cream and sugar
would be great. Thanks.

17:32.177 --> 17:35.848
- Make sure its foot's out the door.
- Put it in a cup to go. Got it.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.184
This icy weather hasn't
kept customers away. They keep coming.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.812
A lot of vegetable soup
being eaten tonight, yessiree.

17:41.854 --> 17:44.982
I hope I don't put the good people
at CampbelI's out of business.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.651
Hey, Taylor. Didn't notice you there.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.028
- Hello.
- Taking a little break?

17:50.070 --> 17:52.656
I don't see how if you're anywhere near
as busy as I am.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.575
Keep waiting for a lull, never get one.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.869
I say to the people, 'I'll be back in a jiff. '

17:56.952 --> 17:58.996
Look at them.
They're lining up there already.

17:59.079 --> 18:02.082
FYI, Van Halen hair, I'm plenty busy.

18:02.166 --> 18:06.378
But a good, well-groomed businessman
with properly prepared staff...

18:06.461 --> 18:08.005
can take a break now and then.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.382
Probably helped that
your store was dead, too.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.427
- It was not dead.
- I thought it was closed when I walked by.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.096
Then I saw Gabby at the cash register
reading a tabloid...

18:16.180 --> 18:17.890
- Shut up.
- Tapping on the counter...

18:17.931 --> 18:20.184
- with one of those astrological scrolls.
- Enough.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.228
- Here you go.
- Gracias. Boy, it's a mob scene.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.572
Luke, it's me.

18:34.573 --> 18:36.658
Brought you a wimpy
with a rose pinned on it.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.827
- A what?
- A turkey burger with onions.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.414
- Thanks. Come on.
- How's the money pit coming?

18:42.498 --> 18:46.418
- Just... That's it.
- What's the matter?

18:52.174 --> 18:54.426
- None of them are coming, not one.
- Who?

18:54.510 --> 18:56.637
My relatives,
the ones I booked the rooms for.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.806
- Not one is coming to Louie's funeral.
- You're kidding. Why?

18:59.890 --> 19:01.892
Which lame-o excuse
do you want to hear first?

19:01.975 --> 19:05.020
- A bunch claim they can't get out of work.
- That's not so lame-o.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.190
Randy and Barbara don't want to miss
their kid's rugby semifinal.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.859
- Rugby has semifinals?
- My sister never even called back.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.695
My cousins that
my dad helped put through college...

19:13.779 --> 19:15.989
said they were too exhausted
from a fishing trip.

19:16.073 --> 19:20.953
And slightly disturbed cousin Frannie said
she can't leave because her Petey's sick.

19:21.036 --> 19:22.287
- Son?
- Parrot.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.706
- Petey, the parrot?
- I saw the stupid thing once...

19:24.790 --> 19:26.959
flapping its wings like crazy,
banging around...

19:27.000 --> 19:31.129
squawking the only two words it knows
over and over: 'Petey' and 'gorgeous. '

19:31.213 --> 19:33.090
Gorgeous. Petey.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.759
- That's disturbing.
- My family's disturbing.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.302
I'm so sorry.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.430
This is wrong. This is not how it's done.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.808
A family member dies,
you pay your respects, period.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.561
If they don't want to be there,
you don't want them there.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.980
- My dad wanted them to be there.
- I know.

19:48.063 --> 19:52.651
Louie lived in Stars Hollow most of his life.
So people from here will be there, right?

19:52.734 --> 19:53.902
Right.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.989
I know it's upsetting,
but maybe it's better this way.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.450
Yeah, I guess. I really hate that bird.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.829
What's up? You got a herd of bulls
shopping for china?

20:03.871 --> 20:04.997
- What?
- Customers.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.623
How long have you owned a diner?

20:06.707 --> 20:09.376
Sorry. Jackson wants to talk to you.
Says it's important.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.837
- About what?
- I don't know. He seems upset.

20:11.879 --> 20:14.590
- All right. You okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.427
- You might want to study that diner talk.
- I'll do that tonight.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.597
- Where's Jess?
- Probably out playing basketball.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.682
That little punk.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.854
Can I take your order?

20:28.896 --> 20:32.107
Yes. Bacon, lettuce,
and tomato sandwich, no mayo.

20:34.151 --> 20:37.988
I need a piggy-piggy with a green bed...
Green blanket.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.866
BLT, no mayo. Rats.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.457
- I'm a miserable man.
- What's up?

20:48.540 --> 20:52.377
Remember that sweet, simple, affordable,
little wedding Sookie and I agreed on...

20:52.461 --> 20:56.381
with minimal disagreement, none in fact,
perhaps the first time in the history...

20:56.423 --> 20:59.259
of wedding planning that a couple
agreed 100% on everything?

20:59.343 --> 21:01.595
- Yes.
- Gone. Ancient history.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.348
It's the library of Alexandria,
the colossus of Rhodes.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.892
It's Pop Rocks. It's over.
And do you know why?

21:06.975 --> 21:08.644
- My mother?
- Look.

21:08.727 --> 21:11.104
- What are they doing?
- They're measuring the town.

21:11.188 --> 21:14.024
They're measuring the entire town
with tape measures.

21:14.066 --> 21:17.444
Your mother got hers at Neiman Marcus.
It's platinum with gold leaf.

21:17.528 --> 21:20.030
- Costs more than my car.
- I'm so sorry.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.575
I love Sookie, and I want her
to have what she wants.

21:23.617 --> 21:27.079
But... You see what they're doing now?

21:27.120 --> 21:30.874
According to their diagrams,
that's where the 16-piece orchestra goes.

21:30.916 --> 21:34.002
How are they gonna fit
a 16-piece orchestra in the gazebo?

21:34.086 --> 21:35.963
- They want to move the gazebo.
- What?

21:36.046 --> 21:39.341
A gazebo that's been there for 100 years,
and they want to move it.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.592
Who moves a gazebo?

21:40.676 --> 21:44.555
What kind of twisted mind even thinks
about moving a gazebo?

21:44.596 --> 21:46.932
- Okay. I'll take care of this.
- She's so excited.

21:47.015 --> 21:50.686
She's brainwashed. She's Patricia Hearst
and my mother is the SLA.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.146
- I just hope it's not too late.
- I hope so, too.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.232
- Watch the shirt.
- Cork it.

22:03.949 --> 22:07.161
- It seems the right thing to do, Taylor.
- I concur.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.454
When one gazes at Stars Hollow...

22:09.538 --> 22:12.791
one can easily overlook a vital component
of its beauty...

22:12.875 --> 22:16.336
and that's the humble,
yet spunky twinkle light.

22:16.461 --> 22:18.755
- Holy cow.
- It doesn't get fruitier.

22:18.797 --> 22:22.968
Harry's House of Twinkle Lights has been
an integral part of this town for 20 years...

22:23.051 --> 22:25.596
so it's only right
that we honor his retirement.

22:25.679 --> 22:29.224
So I hereby designate next Tuesday,
'Harry, the Twinkle Light Man...

22:29.308 --> 22:31.768
'from Harry's House
of Twinkle Lights' day.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.354
That just trips off the tongue.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.317
- Late again, are we?
- Yes. I hope I'm not pregnant.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.401
What?

22:39.484 --> 22:41.528
- Are these seats taken?
- Don't drag me in this.

22:41.612 --> 22:45.491
You have to work on your punctuality.
I banged the meeting in a half an hour ago.

22:45.574 --> 22:46.617
Dirty.

22:46.658 --> 22:50.204
I'm gonna take advantage of this
unexpected pause in our proceedings...

22:50.287 --> 22:53.040
to confer with Miss Patty
about the next item on our agenda.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.666
- What did we miss?
- Harry's retiring.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.793
What do we do for twinkle lights?

22:56.877 --> 22:58.962
- Go to any discount store.
- Blasphemy.

22:59.046 --> 23:00.631
What are you doing here, anyhow?

23:00.672 --> 23:04.343
This is a town meeting for people who
participate in and care about the town.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.095
Corky's Country Cavalcade
on public access was pre-empted.

23:07.179 --> 23:10.516
- Thought I'd check out the next best thing.
- I'm surprised to see you.

23:10.599 --> 23:13.894
I haven't been able to get any
of the war re-enactors on the phone...

23:13.977 --> 23:16.104
and I have to confirm them
for Louie's funeral.

23:16.188 --> 23:19.525
The last order of business is a matter
relating personally to me.

23:19.608 --> 23:23.028
- So I'm going to give Miss Patty my gavel.
- Again. Dirty.

23:23.070 --> 23:26.240
Stop that. Now, don't go power mad.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.868
All right. Gee.

23:31.370 --> 23:36.166
The chair recognizes Taylor Doose.
Taylor, you have the floor.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.459
Thank you, Patty.

23:37.543 --> 23:40.546
My issue, ladies and gentlemen,
is in the form of a grievance...

23:40.629 --> 23:44.758
against this hirsute hippie
who opened a produce stand in the park.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.219
- Oh, yeah. Killer veggies.
- Tasty.

23:47.553 --> 23:51.265
- His squash is beautiful.
- Sexy. It's sexy squash.

23:51.473 --> 23:55.811
Sexy or not, I demand that this man
produce his permit posthaste.

23:55.894 --> 23:57.563
Got it right here.

24:00.566 --> 24:04.611
Just what I thought. This is not the proper
permit for this kind of business.

24:04.695 --> 24:09.366
This is a Type 24B. Otherwise known
as a Cart, Kiosk, Cart/Kiosk permit.

24:09.908 --> 24:13.453
- This is not valid for your business.
- Why does it say it twice?

24:13.704 --> 24:16.081
You said, 'Cart, kiosk, cart, kiosk. '

24:16.165 --> 24:18.500
- It's repetitive.
- And redundant.

24:18.584 --> 24:21.170
- We certainly are entertaining, Mac.
- Indubitably, Tosh.

24:21.253 --> 24:24.089
It's not redundant.
It's three separate things.

24:24.173 --> 24:26.967
It's a cart, a kiosk,
and a mechanical hybrid...

24:27.050 --> 24:29.970
referred to as a cart/kiosk.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.972
Hence, cart, kiosk, cart/kiosk.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.140
He did it again.

24:33.223 --> 24:35.434
He's been stressed lately.
His store is deserted.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.810
I'll make it simple:

24:36.894 --> 24:40.939
This is for businesses that roll in
in the morning and roll out at night.

24:41.023 --> 24:42.566
Emphasis on the word 'roll. '

24:42.649 --> 24:45.736
Rolling businesses. Businesses that roll.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.863
But I carry my tables out at night.

24:47.946 --> 24:52.618
You're supposed to roll them, Rapunzel,
and carrying isn't rolling, is it?

24:52.743 --> 24:56.747
I mean, did anyone hear the word 'rolling'
come out of his mouth?

24:56.788 --> 25:00.459
Check the transcript.
You'll find one word missing: Rolling.

25:00.501 --> 25:03.378
- Transcript?
- Taylor, this isn't Charlie Rose.

25:03.462 --> 25:05.088
He's losing his marbles.

25:05.130 --> 25:08.258
- It's just a personal vendetta.
- His store is deserted.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.137
- I think we should end the meeting here.
- Wait a second.

25:13.180 --> 25:17.392
You, there, when Lady Godiva here
wanted to be town troubadour over you...

25:17.476 --> 25:20.145
I stood by your side.
Why aren't you backing me now?

25:20.229 --> 25:24.274
'Cause you left me twisting for a long time
before you did, and it didn't feel good.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.984
I wrote a song about the experience.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.904
I heard it.
It's called Taylor Left Me Twisting.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.656
- It's really good.
- You think?

25:30.697 --> 25:32.825
'Cause I'm having trouble with the chorus.

25:32.908 --> 25:36.537
Taylor left me twisting
He set my eyes a-misting

25:36.620 --> 25:40.040
- I'm not sure if it has that thing, though.
- No, I love that part.

25:40.123 --> 25:44.211
I actually thought that maybe at the end,
you could do more about the sweater.

25:44.294 --> 25:45.337
We'll talk.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.047
I'm gonna wrap this up.

25:47.506 --> 25:51.218
Patty, how would you feel
if this guy decided to open...

25:51.301 --> 25:55.973
the Longhaired Freak School of Dance?
Or the Longhaired Freak Diner, Luke?

25:56.014 --> 25:59.643
Or the Longhaired Freak Bookstore?
It's not good, right?

25:59.726 --> 26:03.689
Everybody who agrees that we would
not feel good about that, say aye.

26:04.147 --> 26:06.608
Meeting adjourned. Good night.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.027
Taylor, hold on a sec.

26:09.361 --> 26:12.865
Don't you have some cleaning up
to do over at the diner?

26:15.450 --> 26:18.162
Guys, come on.
You heard me calling you. Stop.

26:18.203 --> 26:21.540
- What is it, Luke?
- My uncle Louie's funeraI's tomorrow.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.417
I haven't heard from any of you.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.129
He was a World War II veteran,
and that's what you re-enactor freaks do...

26:27.212 --> 26:30.549
you go to vets' funerals.
So you're gonna be there, right? Hello?

26:30.591 --> 26:33.927
- You said you were gonna talk to him.
- Burt said he was gonna do it.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.221
- It's Taylor's job.
- You always pass it on.

26:36.263 --> 26:38.640
- Talk to me about what?
- You might as well know.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.851
- We don't want to go to Louie's funeral.
- What?

26:40.934 --> 26:43.645
- We all hated Louie.
- That's not true.

26:43.729 --> 26:47.357
He always had a scowl on his face,
not a kind word for anybody.

26:47.399 --> 26:50.903
He would light those hideous cigars,
blow smoke in people's faces...

26:50.986 --> 26:53.030
and then spit after each puff.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.908
- He was disgusting.
- He kicked my dog when I was a kid.

26:55.991 --> 26:59.286
- He hit on my wife repeatedly.
- Toto was always different after that.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.871
My wife was much affected as well.

27:00.954 --> 27:05.125
I'd toss her something to fetch. She'd run
after it and then forget about it.

27:05.209 --> 27:08.837
- She stopped enjoying her soap operas.
- She'd just lie down and go to sleep.

27:08.921 --> 27:11.632
- This is an exaggeration.
- We're not exaggerating.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.467
We threw a big party when he left town.

27:13.550 --> 27:16.261
I made love to my wife that night
like I never have.

27:16.303 --> 27:19.890
My Toto barked a happy bark, then quietly
stopped breathing. She was old.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.768
- I don't believe this.
- You knew the guy.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.395
This man was my uncle,
and a war veteran.

27:25.437 --> 27:29.274
He deserves a veteran's funeral.
But, if you guys are too lazy to show up...

27:29.358 --> 27:33.737
He's the lazy one. Never once
did he participate in a town function.

27:33.779 --> 27:36.532
When we re-enactors gathered,
he'd throw things at us.

27:36.615 --> 27:40.202
- And not soft things. Hard things.
- Rocks and small tools.

27:40.285 --> 27:41.453
I've heard enough.

27:41.537 --> 27:44.706
And he got meaner as he got older.
Never married, never had kids.

27:44.790 --> 27:48.126
- A real loner.
- To hell with you guys. Who needs you?

27:49.753 --> 27:53.173
I might throw rocks and small tools myself
next time I see you.

27:53.257 --> 27:56.885
- A defensive hothead just like Louie.
- Practically clones.

27:58.637 --> 28:01.265
Oh, my god. This is so high tech.

28:01.431 --> 28:02.808
What's going on?

28:02.850 --> 28:05.060
I'm downloading wedding stuff
from Prague.

28:05.143 --> 28:07.813
- You're kidding.
- It's streaming in right now.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.524
That's Internet talk. Streaming.
Did you know that?

28:10.607 --> 28:14.152
It's not called Czechoslovakia anymore.
Just Czech Republic.

28:14.236 --> 28:17.406
Slovakia is its own separate thing.
It's weird, isn't it?

28:17.489 --> 28:20.993
Like saying there's no more Connecticut.
It's just 'Connec' and 'Ticut. '

28:21.076 --> 28:25.080
- What are you downloading from Prague?
- This will much amuse you.

28:25.205 --> 28:28.750
- Color samples for the big ceramic stands.
- Stands for what?

28:28.834 --> 28:31.962
- For the giant papier-maché mushrooms.
- What are the mushrooms for?

28:32.004 --> 28:35.007
For the midgets dressed like angels
to dance under, silly.

28:35.048 --> 28:36.133
Oh, my God.

28:36.216 --> 28:39.386
Emily found the best papier-maché
mushroom maker in Paris.

28:39.469 --> 28:42.264
He's much better than the guy
in Belgium. What a hack.

28:42.347 --> 28:45.017
I need you to stop staring at the screen.
We need to talk.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.977
Please don't talk her out of these things.

28:47.019 --> 28:50.314
I do not want to die without seeing
midgets dancing with mushrooms.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.065
- Stay out of this.
- You're no fun.

28:52.149 --> 28:53.233
What is it, honey?

28:53.317 --> 28:57.821
The danger of Emily-world is that
you don't always know you're in it...

28:57.905 --> 29:02.117
- when actually you are.
- Not this Emily-world stuff again.

29:02.201 --> 29:05.329
Have you run the numbers on any of this?
What is this costing you?

29:05.370 --> 29:09.333
I don't know the full cost, but your mother
is getting me 50% off of everything.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.085
- She is so connected.
- But 50% off a load of money...

29:12.169 --> 29:14.922
is still half a load of money.
You don't have that to spend.

29:15.005 --> 29:18.509
- If I scrimp, I can afford a quarter load.
- That's still too much.

29:18.592 --> 29:23.180
- Your mother said she'd chip in a little.
- That is way inappropriate.

29:23.388 --> 29:26.350
I didn't take her up on it, but it was nice.

29:27.059 --> 29:31.730
This isn't you: The midgets, mushrooms,
and God knows what else.

29:32.856 --> 29:35.526
- And it isn't Jackson either.
- What do you mean?

29:35.567 --> 29:37.569
- We talked.
- You and Jackson talked?

29:37.611 --> 29:41.573
I'm sorry, but he came to me all upset.
And I love both of you...

29:41.657 --> 29:44.576
and it just seemed like it was time
for me to meddle.

29:44.868 --> 29:47.120
- He was upset?
- He was pretty upset.

29:47.204 --> 29:50.749
- Why didn't he just talk to me?
- Because he's Jackson.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.961
He wants you to be happy
and to give you everything you want.

29:54.044 --> 29:57.422
So what it comes down to is,
is this what you want?

30:00.050 --> 30:04.012
Maybe the midgets are a little over the top
and the mushrooms...

30:07.724 --> 30:10.477
Oh, my God. It's all sounding so silly now.

30:10.561 --> 30:14.273
- You're coming out of it. Keep going.
- No, it's not what I want.

30:14.356 --> 30:18.485
We were supposed to keep this nice
and simple. God, we had it all worked out.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.696
- So go back.
- I will go back.

30:21.446 --> 30:25.075
- That is if Jackson still wants to marry me.
- Of course he still wants to.

30:25.117 --> 30:27.828
I'm gonna call him and tell him
it's all changing back.

30:27.911 --> 30:29.121
Good.

30:29.163 --> 30:32.749
I should call and cancel some stuff first.
I've got to call Belgium, Oslo...

30:32.833 --> 30:35.919
- Copenhagen, Bora Bora.
- What did you order from there?

30:36.461 --> 30:39.423
- I'm gonna shield you from that one.
- Thanks.

30:43.010 --> 30:44.344
Slow down.

30:46.013 --> 30:48.724
Okay, I'll come right over. I got to go.

30:51.268 --> 30:54.479
- Call and... Welcome back, friend.
- Thanks.

30:54.771 --> 30:58.525
I'm gonna start with Hong Kong.
Hope those acrobats can get another gig.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.571
- There you are.
- It won't close.

31:02.654 --> 31:04.615
- What?
- The lid.

31:06.450 --> 31:08.577
Hello, Louie.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.121
- That's Louie.
- Nice tan.

31:11.497 --> 31:14.625
- Now you say the lid won't close?
- Yes.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.377
- Did you buy the right size?
- Of course.

31:17.461 --> 31:20.589
It's the model we recommend for those
of medium height and weight.

31:20.672 --> 31:23.592
- And he's of medium height and weight.
- Why won't it close?

31:23.675 --> 31:27.971
Because of the stuff. He left a list of stuff
he wanted buried with him.

31:28.013 --> 31:30.724
- It's not uncommon.
- It's a very long list.

31:30.807 --> 31:34.269
Fishing reel, bowling trophy, a flask,
his antique dueling pistols...

31:34.353 --> 31:36.230
his copy of Sherman's memoirs.

31:36.313 --> 31:38.607
- Is all the stuff in there now?
- Yes, it is.

31:38.690 --> 31:41.235
I shoved it in the best I could,
but it won't close...

31:41.318 --> 31:45.280
which defeats the purpose of having
a damn casket in the first place.

31:45.364 --> 31:47.282
- May I?
- Give it a shot.

31:54.289 --> 31:57.668
The football signed by Johnny Unitas
gives it that bounce.

31:57.709 --> 32:02.339
What if we move the gas mask
and pith helmet down towards the feet?

32:02.381 --> 32:06.218
That end already has every baseball card
he ever bought, thousands of them.

32:06.260 --> 32:08.512
Bungee cord. No.

32:09.221 --> 32:12.057
What if we got some people
from the office here...

32:12.099 --> 32:16.854
to sit on the lid and we could latch it?
Do you have anybody you could spring?

32:17.104 --> 32:18.856
- I'm out of ideas.
- So am I.

32:18.897 --> 32:21.733
You know what? To hell with this.

32:21.859 --> 32:24.862
- I can't deal with this anymore.
- It has to be dealt with.

32:24.945 --> 32:28.574
It doesn't. It's not as if he deserves
my help or my respect.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.576
- The man was your uncle.
- He was a jerk!

32:30.617 --> 32:33.287
- Don't say that.
- Taylor and the guys were right.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.873
I was cutting Louie slack out of respect
for my dad...

32:35.914 --> 32:39.501
but the man was rotten and mean
and selfish all his life.

32:39.585 --> 32:41.420
He's even selfish in death.

32:41.503 --> 32:44.256
Other people would have loved
to have those baseball cards.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.466
I would have loved to had those cards.

32:46.550 --> 32:50.804
He's got Lou Gehrig's rookie card,
Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, tons of others.

32:50.888 --> 32:55.392
But, no. My uncle, King Tut, has to take all
of them to the afterlife with him.

32:55.475 --> 32:58.061
- Sir, your voice.
- I'm done. I've had it.

32:59.062 --> 33:02.399
From now on, it's just the bare minimum
and that's it.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.277
Dig a big hole and just dump
the casket in unlatched.

33:05.319 --> 33:10.073
If stuff falls out, fine. Pile on enough dirt
and make sure nothing's showing.

33:12.701 --> 33:15.078
I'm assuming that wouldn't
be appropriate, either.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.039
- No.
- I didn't think so.

33:22.836 --> 33:26.048
Young man, where's the young lady
we heard so much about...

33:26.131 --> 33:29.843
who's using those delightful old diner
phrases to place people's orders?

33:29.927 --> 33:32.846
It sounds so fun.
Could you point her out for us?

33:32.930 --> 33:33.931
No.

33:35.015 --> 33:37.017
That's to everyone. I'll be upstairs.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.728
Thanks for doing the very least
you could possibly do.

33:39.811 --> 33:40.812
You're welcome.

33:40.896 --> 33:44.316
- There you are. I was worried.
- Sorry, I should have called.

33:44.399 --> 33:47.361
Thanks for covering again.
This'll be the last time. I promise.

33:47.444 --> 33:49.154
It's okay. Where were you?

33:49.196 --> 33:52.783
First, I walked around a bunch
trying to clear my head.

33:52.866 --> 33:56.161
- Saw a lot of Hartford. What a cesspool.
- You're not a city man.

33:56.203 --> 34:00.290
I calmed down and figured
dumping Louie's body in an open grave...

34:00.374 --> 34:02.835
with all his stuff probably
would be a little cold.

34:02.876 --> 34:03.961
A tad.

34:04.169 --> 34:07.714
I got a yellow pages and found
a big-and-tall casket shop in Hartford.

34:07.798 --> 34:08.882
- You're kidding.
- Nope.

34:08.966 --> 34:12.386
I found a casket for my 160-pound uncle
and his 140 pounds of stuff.

34:12.469 --> 34:16.348
Got the lid to shut the first time we tried.
So the funeraI's on as scheduled.

34:16.389 --> 34:19.184
- Good.
- I don't know why I'm doing this.

34:19.268 --> 34:22.103
- For your dad.
- I guess, although he's dead...

34:22.187 --> 34:24.523
so he'd never know
if I was doing it any different.

34:24.606 --> 34:25.649
He knows.

34:25.690 --> 34:30.529
He's got the big Luke picture screen on
24 hours a day, he watches and smiles.

34:30.904 --> 34:33.239
And you're doing it 'cause you're you.

34:33.322 --> 34:36.659
I'm gonna change, then you can retire
from your diner career forever.

34:36.702 --> 34:39.163
No, it's fun.
I came up with some new diner phrases.

34:39.204 --> 34:41.331
- You know what a 'lucky duck cluck' is?
- No.

34:41.415 --> 34:44.376
It's foie gras with chicken
and green shamrock frosting.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.504
- Why would anyone order that?
- If they're high.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.755
- Good grief.
- What?

34:49.840 --> 34:52.176
Bad vibe sandwich just came in.
You better retreat.

34:52.217 --> 34:53.844
I won't be long.

34:54.178 --> 34:57.306
- Hi, Mom.
- Since when do you work here?

34:57.389 --> 34:59.349
I'm just lending a hand. What's going on?

34:59.391 --> 35:01.810
I went by the inn to work with Sookie
on her wedding.

35:01.894 --> 35:02.895
Yeah?

35:02.978 --> 35:05.105
- And she fired me.
- She didn't fire you.

35:05.189 --> 35:07.691
She's changed her mind
on all the things we planned.

35:07.733 --> 35:09.401
- Maybe she did.
- No, she didn't.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.987
I know what's behind this.
That is, who's behind this.

35:12.070 --> 35:15.073
It was getting to be too much
for her and her fiancé.

35:15.157 --> 35:17.576
- I knew it.
- These are not wealthy people.

35:17.659 --> 35:20.579
Do you understand that?
They're saving for a home...

35:20.662 --> 35:24.082
and your midgets were dancing
between them and their dreams.

35:24.166 --> 35:27.127
- You say 'midgets' like it's so absurd.
- Do you hear yourself?

35:27.211 --> 35:30.506
I don't see what was wrong
with my helping Sookie plan her wedding.

35:30.589 --> 35:32.049
- Mom, come on.
- What?

35:32.090 --> 35:35.427
- You weren't planning Sookie's wedding.
- Whose wedding was I planning?

35:35.469 --> 35:37.846
- Mine.
- Don't be ridiculous.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.849
Your vision for this wedding
and all the over-the-top stuff...

35:40.933 --> 35:45.395
like flowers, bunting, champagne fountain,
and the haute-couture dress.

35:45.437 --> 35:49.441
Who's wearing that wedding dress
in your mind's eye, Mom? Sookie? Or me?

35:49.525 --> 35:53.028
- I wasn't planning your wedding, Lorelai.
- Right.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.364
The wedding I was planning
was for Sookie.

35:55.447 --> 35:59.076
The mushrooms and colors,
they all seemed like fun, a little crazy...

35:59.159 --> 36:01.912
just like she is.
It definitely was not for you.

36:02.120 --> 36:04.873
I know that you'd never let me plan
your wedding.

36:04.957 --> 36:07.668
I gave up on that dream a long time ago.

36:07.835 --> 36:11.380
Yours was going to be a Russian
winter theme, the Romanovs.

36:11.463 --> 36:14.800
- Before the firing squad, I assume?
- Snow-white roses...

36:14.883 --> 36:18.387
trees with white lights and candles.
Snow everywhere.

36:18.470 --> 36:21.640
You arriving in a silver sleigh
with white horses.

36:23.225 --> 36:25.644
- You hate the idea.
- No, I just...

36:26.812 --> 36:30.774
- It just doesn't seem like me.
- It would have been beautiful.

36:30.816 --> 36:32.860
I'm sure it would have been.

36:33.277 --> 36:35.779
It's obvious that wouldn't
be appropriate anymore...

36:35.863 --> 36:38.657
being as I'm probably standing
in your reception hall.

36:38.699 --> 36:41.368
- Excuse me?
- Burgers and fries for the dinner...

36:41.451 --> 36:44.663
the bride walks down the aisle
with a ketchup dispenser in her hand.

36:44.746 --> 36:48.041
- Tell me what you're talking about.
- I'm talking about Luke.

36:49.001 --> 36:52.212
- It's obvious, Lorelai.
- No, it's not, Mom.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.464
- You're with him constantly.
- He feeds me.

36:54.506 --> 36:57.593
- You bring up his name constantly.
- Once again, he feeds me.

36:57.676 --> 37:01.388
- The moment he calls, you run to his side.
- He's my friend. He needed me.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.974
- I had to be there.
- I know you did.

37:07.728 --> 37:09.313
- Hi.
- Hello.

37:12.274 --> 37:15.319
I have to go. I'll see you for dinner tonight.

37:15.694 --> 37:18.614
And Luke, I'm sure I'll see you again soon.

37:24.953 --> 37:28.957
- What do you think of the Romanovs?
- They probably had it coming.

37:29.041 --> 37:30.918
A match made in heaven.

37:36.298 --> 37:39.343
We're here to honor Louie,
to pay our respects...

37:39.426 --> 37:41.929
and to bid him a sorrowful goodbye.

37:42.346 --> 37:43.889
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:43.972 --> 37:47.059
- I'm not big on funerals in general.
- Nobody is.

37:47.267 --> 37:51.438
He passed away in his sleep,
so the end came peacefully for Louie...

37:51.522 --> 37:54.233
which I'm sure is a great comfort
to all who knew him.

37:54.316 --> 37:57.402
The passing-away part
was a great comfort for all who knew him.

37:57.486 --> 37:59.404
- I didn't know him.
- Good thing.

37:59.446 --> 38:03.492
But I understand he was a fine man,
destined to be missed by many.

38:03.575 --> 38:06.995
- Especially the ones that were suing him.
- Stop. Sorry, Father.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.997
- Reverend.
- Right.

38:09.081 --> 38:13.710
Now let us witness Louie Danes
as he is interred and brought to the Lord.

38:19.091 --> 38:23.178
It was a nice and intimate service.

38:23.804 --> 38:26.890
I guess everybody deserves something
at the end.

38:27.766 --> 38:30.853
- Thanks for coming.
- I wouldn't have missed it.

38:33.689 --> 38:35.482
That ain't me, is it?

38:37.109 --> 38:38.277
What are you talking about?

38:38.360 --> 38:40.404
What Taylor said about me
being like Louie:

38:40.487 --> 38:44.741
A loner, never being married and stuff?
I'm getting crankier as I get older.

38:44.783 --> 38:47.786
- He's not so far off.
- You are not your uncle.

38:50.038 --> 38:54.501
Would Louie ever build someone
a huppah or help fix things around...

38:54.585 --> 38:58.422
someone's house without being asked,
or make a special coffee cake...

38:58.463 --> 39:01.800
- with balloons for a girI's 16th birthday?
- Rory told you about that?

39:01.842 --> 39:06.471
Yes. Would Louie have taken in his sister's
kid without asking for anything in return?

39:06.555 --> 39:08.557
No one would've trusted Louie
with their kid.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.976
He probably would have forgotten
to feed him.

39:11.059 --> 39:14.104
- You get my point.
- Yeah, I get it.

39:18.984 --> 39:20.402
What's that?

39:25.282 --> 39:28.327
- Is that Andrew?
- I believe it is.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.788
Left, right, left.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.624
That's all of them.

39:39.546 --> 39:41.048
Company halt.

39:41.715 --> 39:43.300
Company salute!

39:47.012 --> 39:48.222
Thanks.

39:49.515 --> 39:52.142
- It's what your dad wanted.
- Yeah.

39:55.187 --> 39:57.523
And Louie would have hated this.

39:58.732 --> 40:00.526
That's just a fringe benefit.

40:00.609 --> 40:02.486
Present arms!

40:18.794 --> 40:20.295
Do you think he's in heaven?

40:20.379 --> 40:23.507
I hope so, just so my dad
can kick his butt around the place.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.426
- Can you kick in heaven?
- It's probably frowned upon.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.720
Yeah, plus you're
all see-through and gauzy.

40:28.804 --> 40:32.724
- Dad's foot could go right through him.
- This is a silly conversation.

40:32.766 --> 40:35.269
- What's all this?
- I have no idea.

40:41.608 --> 40:44.695
- What's going on?
- It's kind of like a wake for Louie.

40:44.778 --> 40:47.281
- I thought you set it up.
- I didn't set it up.

40:47.364 --> 40:51.160
It's going well. People brought a ton
of food, if you guys are hungry.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.203
- This is unexpected.
- Very.

40:53.245 --> 40:56.540
- Don't you have wakes for people you like?
- Think it might be for you.

40:56.582 --> 40:58.500
- Am I dead?
- Face it. People like you.

40:58.584 --> 41:01.628
- Shut up.
- How can they resist charm like that?

41:02.588 --> 41:06.842
Hey, Taylor. Cool threads.
Very 'One if by land. '

41:07.926 --> 41:11.388
- I see you're digging into the vegetables.
- Thanks for the play-by-play.

41:11.430 --> 41:13.265
Brought those myself.

41:14.016 --> 41:15.684
How was the funeral?

41:16.018 --> 41:19.062
Shouldn't you be tending
to your little stand out there, friend?

41:19.104 --> 41:21.064
- The stand's gone.
- What?

41:21.106 --> 41:24.902
- I'm all packed up. I'm out of here.
- I don't get it.

41:25.152 --> 41:28.614
I grow this stuff in my backyard,
and as of yesterday, sold it all.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.282
- You sold it all?
- Sold it all.

41:30.365 --> 41:33.368
Made enough money to do some traveling.
Have you been to Israel?

41:33.452 --> 41:37.289
Turbulent, but I thought I'd go down
and try and plant some peace down there.

41:37.331 --> 41:40.667
- See if it grows, see if it spreads.
- Shut up.

41:40.792 --> 41:43.795
Why did you put me through
all that hoo-ha at the town meeting...

41:43.879 --> 41:46.298
if your vegetable business
was just temporary?

41:46.381 --> 41:49.843
You put yourself through it, Taylor.

41:53.305 --> 41:56.225
- Nice spread.
- People have too much free time here.

41:56.308 --> 41:57.643
You did a good thing.

41:57.726 --> 42:01.522
- I thought my mom set this up. She didn't.
- So? It wasn't me.

42:01.647 --> 42:03.565
- It wasn't?
- No, no way.

42:04.733 --> 42:06.944
- It wasn't me.
- If you say so.

42:06.985 --> 42:10.697
The crazy ballet teacher asked when Luke
was getting back from the funeral...

42:10.781 --> 42:14.326
if I could unlock the door.
I did and went back to sleep.

42:14.493 --> 42:17.579
- So you did do a little something.
- I unlocked the door.

42:17.663 --> 42:20.290
So people could come in here
and put this together. Nice.

42:20.332 --> 42:22.501
- Nice for them, not for me.
- You facilitated it.

42:22.584 --> 42:25.504
You made it happen.
So you're officially part of our town now.

42:25.546 --> 42:26.713
- Wait a minute.
- Welcome.

42:26.797 --> 42:28.215
I'm not part of this town.

42:28.298 --> 42:31.009
See you for some tree planting
at the Arbor Day festival.

42:31.093 --> 42:34.388
Maybe I can knock over a liquor store
while everyone's planting trees.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.473
As long as it's a liquor store in town.

42:36.515 --> 42:41.061
It's Halloween, and we're lucky Louie
doesn't have razor wire around his yard.

42:42.062 --> 42:46.650
Finally, one of the kids gets courageous
and goes sauntering up to the door.

42:46.692 --> 42:48.193
He goes, 'Trick or treat!'

42:48.277 --> 42:52.781
Louie throws the door open and says,
'Did you get a Reese's cup tonight?'

42:52.865 --> 42:55.534
The kid looks in his bag and says,
'Yes, sir, I did. '

42:55.617 --> 42:59.663
Louie grabs it, says 'Thank you,'
and slams the door in his face.

43:01.874 --> 43:04.209
- I'm sorry I never met him.
- He was colorful.

43:04.293 --> 43:06.044
I never trick-or-treated again.

43:06.086 --> 43:10.382
One day I'm at the post office in line
when Louie just about knocks me over.

43:10.465 --> 43:13.218
He cuts in line.
I said, 'Louie, there's a line! '

43:13.260 --> 43:16.763
He says, 'Kiss my butt. '
I said, 'You mind your manners. '

43:16.847 --> 43:21.059
He says, 'Please kiss my butt,'
and drops his pants.

43:23.145 --> 43:27.065
I got one. Louie was parked outside
Al's Pancake World...

43:27.107 --> 43:29.485
and I was trying to pull
in the space behind him.

43:29.568 --> 43:32.821
All of a sudden, he starts to back up.
I honked my horn...

44:11.902 --> 44:12.903
English
