Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.541 --> 00:04.027
After talking with Lena, we
are not going to ground you.

00:04.051 --> 00:06.233
And you should have talked
to me about it first.

00:06.353 --> 00:08.837
I... I don't wanna be some
half-ass version of a dad.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.534
Brandon has three parents. Period.

00:10.574 --> 00:12.435
Hey. Hey, hey. She said no, man.

00:14.805 --> 00:16.916
So you were looking for
something permanent, for them?

00:16.948 --> 00:19.833
And we want this to be your very
last way station ever, ever, ever.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.570
What's it gonna be, Kelsey?
Where'd you get the drugs?

00:21.577 --> 00:23.830
It was me. I did it.

00:23.853 --> 00:24.940
Here.

00:34.684 --> 00:37.507
Ok. Let's go. Time's up.

00:37.531 --> 00:39.087
Mariana!

00:39.784 --> 00:41.559
My turn.

00:41.753 --> 00:44.722
- Girls take longer.
- No, no, no. But this isn't fair.

00:46.358 --> 00:48.459
- Get out.
- Just gimme a second.

00:48.493 --> 00:49.660
[Brandon] You're not supposed
to be on the computer.

00:49.695 --> 00:53.431
- If Moms find out they're gonna ream me.
- This sucks.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.499
Yeah, well you shouldn't have been
giving away your freaking pills.

00:55.534 --> 00:57.134
Come on. Let's go.

00:57.169 --> 00:58.936
[bell rings]

00:58.970 --> 01:01.338
About time.

01:01.356 --> 01:05.009
Yeah. It hasn't been like
15 extra minutes of anything.

01:05.043 --> 01:07.044
So. thank you for that. What are you doing?

01:07.062 --> 01:08.946
I gotta pee really bad.

01:13.018 --> 01:15.820
- [shower running]
- What? Jude!

01:15.854 --> 01:17.755
- I thought you were just...
- [Jude] I'll be really fast! I promise!

01:23.729 --> 01:26.330
If you wanna borrow something...

01:26.365 --> 01:29.283
- Uh, no. It's ok.
- Ok.

01:29.317 --> 01:31.435
I just thought you might be sick
of wearing the same three things...

01:51.690 --> 01:53.791
I'm not gonna steal your earrings.

01:53.825 --> 01:56.694
I mean, what am I gonna
do? Sell them at school?

01:56.728 --> 01:58.763
Don't talk about things
you don't understand.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.335
Ok. Well, what don't I understand, Mariana?

02:04.369 --> 02:07.238
I mean you stole your brother's
pills, you sold them at school,

02:07.272 --> 02:09.407
and then you let your
brother take the fall for you.

02:09.441 --> 02:11.208
I never asked him to do that.

02:11.243 --> 02:13.244
But you let him.

02:23.021 --> 02:25.089
Buddy, can you do that in the
bathroom like everybody else, please?

02:25.123 --> 02:28.692
- Come on.
- What's that?

02:28.727 --> 02:30.628
We are brown baggin' I for a little while.

02:30.662 --> 02:32.596
[Stef] It's better for you. Go spit.

02:32.631 --> 02:35.516
- I don't eat cheese.
- [scoffs]

02:35.550 --> 02:37.802
Since when? You had pizza
like two nights ago...

02:37.836 --> 02:39.787
It's really bad for you.

02:39.838 --> 02:42.339
Can I have tuna?

02:42.357 --> 02:44.542
- If you want to make it.
- Mm.

02:44.576 --> 02:47.545
All right, everyone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:47.579 --> 02:50.181
- Where's Brandon?
- [Brandon yelps]

02:50.215 --> 02:51.382
[Brandon] Cold!

02:51.416 --> 02:55.419
Oops. I guess there's no more hot water.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.012
<i>* It's not where you come from *</i>

03:05.063 --> 03:08.199
<i>* It's where you belong *</i>

03:08.233 --> 03:10.901

03:10.936 --> 03:14.205

03:37.394 --> 03:40.963
She spends like an extra 15 minutes
in the shower I'm not even kidding.

03:40.981 --> 03:42.348
It's like my turn and they...

03:42.399 --> 03:44.233
Sounds like you guys
need another bathroom...

03:44.267 --> 03:46.969
Or four less kids.

03:46.987 --> 03:49.271
I just want some privacy, really.

03:49.305 --> 03:51.240
Yeah, well I don't think my parents

03:51.274 --> 03:53.108
are going out of town again any time soon,

03:53.142 --> 03:56.245
so I'm afraid you missed your
chance for privacy, mister.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.030
Well, we can figure it out.

03:58.081 --> 04:02.284
How? It's not like we'll be
alone at your place ever again.

04:08.208 --> 04:11.159
Poor guy. How long is he in detention for?

04:11.178 --> 04:14.213
- All week.
- Oof. That's rough.

04:14.264 --> 04:16.849
What do you care?

04:16.882 --> 04:20.219
I don't. I just feel sorry
for him. What's with you?

04:21.271 --> 04:23.338
Nothing, I just...

04:23.356 --> 04:25.340
look, I feel bad enough about it, ok?

04:25.358 --> 04:28.110
Ok, but you really don't have to.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.080
Think about all the times you
covered for him. He'll be fine.

04:31.114 --> 04:33.949
It's not like he ever pays
attention in class anyway.

04:45.495 --> 04:47.530
Look, Jude seems like a good kid...

04:47.564 --> 04:48.631
He is.

04:48.665 --> 04:51.500
But the Parent Board
is all over me on this.

04:51.535 --> 04:53.636
Obviously, we're ok
giving you a little leeway,

04:53.670 --> 04:56.138
but he has to pass the proficiency exam

04:56.172 --> 04:58.140
that the other kids took to get in,

04:58.174 --> 05:00.342
or I'm afraid you're going to
have to send him somewhere else...

05:00.377 --> 05:03.212
I can't send him to another school.

05:03.246 --> 05:05.164
He would be completely lost.

05:05.198 --> 05:06.982
That's part of the reason
he's so behind right now.

05:07.017 --> 05:09.818
Because he hasn't had
anybody to look out for him.

05:09.853 --> 05:11.253
Look, I'm not unsympathetic, Lena...

05:11.288 --> 05:15.057
The only sense of security this
kid has in the world is his sister.

05:15.091 --> 05:17.059
Separating them would be terrible for him.

05:17.093 --> 05:19.695
Look, I'm trying to protect you here, too.

05:19.729 --> 05:20.946
You know how this works.

05:20.997 --> 05:22.798
Our funding is based on performance.

05:22.832 --> 05:27.536
And now I have a new seventh
grader who jumped the wait list,

05:27.571 --> 05:31.373
who isn't operating at
even close to grade level.

05:33.209 --> 05:35.377
Is it possible we could
just give him more time?

05:35.412 --> 05:37.212
Before he has to take the exam, I mean?

05:37.247 --> 05:39.348
I know if I just had a little while
to get him caught up I could...

05:39.382 --> 05:41.984
Lena. He passes the exam on Friday,

05:42.018 --> 05:43.185
or he's done at Anchor Beach.

05:45.188 --> 05:49.174
[Timothy] Now, he's guilty,
insofar as he did commit the crime,

05:49.209 --> 05:52.945
But he doesn't feel that way
until he actually gets caught.

05:52.979 --> 05:57.766
Ok. I want everyone to write about
guilt in their journals this week.

05:58.635 --> 05:59.868
Wait, write?

05:59.903 --> 06:01.737
Like with a pen? Like longhand?

06:01.771 --> 06:04.440
Yes, like longhand.

06:04.474 --> 06:07.409
And don't worry. No one's gonna read it.

06:07.444 --> 06:09.678
It's just for you to get in
the habit of writing every day.

06:09.713 --> 06:12.381
[school bell rings]

06:12.415 --> 06:15.350
Ok, guys. Seriously, I want you
to write about whatever it is

06:15.368 --> 06:18.087
that you feel weird or
ashamed or guilty about.

06:18.121 --> 06:20.356
You'll feel better about it, I promise.

06:34.104 --> 06:36.789
Weak, Foster. Very weak.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.973
And quit "nudging" me online.

06:38.008 --> 06:40.909
- Hey, meet me tomorrow.
- Meet you? Why?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.545
You're in detention all day, remember?

06:43.580 --> 06:45.681
I'm gonna have Douglas
let me go to the bathroom.

06:45.715 --> 06:48.534
So, two o'clock. I'll meet
you by the lifeguard stand.

06:49.552 --> 06:51.553
I don't know. I have to think about it.

06:51.588 --> 06:53.288
Foster!

06:53.590 --> 06:55.391
What?

06:55.425 --> 06:57.426
I'll see you tomorrow.

07:02.098 --> 07:04.900
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

07:04.934 --> 07:06.969
Talking to Lexi. What's the big deal?

07:07.003 --> 07:10.105
No classes, no extra-curricular, no fun.

07:10.140 --> 07:12.041
In school detention and home. Period.

07:12.075 --> 07:13.676
But we've got a game this week.

07:13.710 --> 07:15.678
Not my problem.

07:15.712 --> 07:17.646
Jesus, you gave away your pills.

07:17.681 --> 07:20.582
Do you not understand how serious that is?

07:20.617 --> 07:22.818
This could have been a lot worse.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.427
Use your legs, B. You're
not using your legs.

07:31.461 --> 07:35.631
The twins are both mad because Moms
moved Callie and Jude into their room

07:35.665 --> 07:38.100
and not mine, so like everyone's all...

07:38.134 --> 07:40.135
everyone's all tense all the time.

07:42.105 --> 07:43.172
[Mike] That's more like it.

07:44.407 --> 07:46.241
Nice. You want some water?

07:48.011 --> 07:49.111
Yeah.

07:54.968 --> 07:57.052
So, I was thinking,

07:57.070 --> 07:59.988
maybe you might wanna spend
some more time at my place?

08:00.023 --> 08:01.724
Maybe even move in with me.

08:04.627 --> 08:05.728
Why?

08:07.430 --> 08:09.598
Well, you know I mean,
the new kids in the house.

08:09.632 --> 08:11.600
The place is busting at the seams...

08:11.634 --> 08:14.470
I only get you the one night a week.

08:14.504 --> 08:17.473
You're going be going off
to college before too long...

08:17.507 --> 08:19.391
and I kinda feel like I'm missing out.

08:19.426 --> 08:21.510
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:21.544 --> 08:24.046
Could be fun. Why not?

08:26.082 --> 08:27.282
Look, you don't have to say anything.

08:27.317 --> 08:29.201
Just think about it and let me know.

08:41.450 --> 08:42.549
You mind?

08:44.220 --> 08:46.054
- What?
- The song. It's annoying.

08:49.108 --> 08:50.892
You're in a good mood tonight...

08:50.926 --> 08:51.993
I'm always in a good mood.

08:52.027 --> 08:54.028
You're in a really good mood tonight.

08:55.831 --> 08:57.031
Are you...

08:57.049 --> 08:59.801
is there someone you haven't told me about?

08:59.818 --> 09:02.570
What? No.

09:02.605 --> 09:06.608
Really? Nothing's going on? Nothing at all?

09:06.642 --> 09:10.545
Nothing between you and Lexi?

09:11.614 --> 09:13.348
Not at all.

09:13.382 --> 09:15.583
That's not what it looked
like this afternoon.

09:16.385 --> 09:18.286
When? At volleyball?

09:18.320 --> 09:20.121
We were just talking.

09:20.155 --> 09:21.422
I was helping her with her kill.

09:21.457 --> 09:24.125
[scoffs] With her kill, really?

09:26.295 --> 09:29.264
What can I say, I'm irresistible...

09:32.835 --> 09:36.004
Relax. You know I wouldn't date
one of your lame friends anyway.

09:36.038 --> 09:38.106
Right?

09:41.777 --> 09:43.745
So, I won't be able to go
to school with everyone else?

09:43.779 --> 09:45.546
No, no, no. Honey, listen,

09:45.581 --> 09:46.814
all we need to do is give you the test,

09:46.849 --> 09:48.850
and once you pass it,
everything's gonna be fine.

09:48.884 --> 09:50.685
If he passes it.

09:50.719 --> 09:55.390
Well, yes, but all he needs a 65
or better, and we're good to go.

09:56.425 --> 09:58.326
You can do that, right?

09:58.360 --> 09:59.560
This isn't fair.

10:01.163 --> 10:04.265
No, it's not. But this
is what I want to suggest,

10:04.300 --> 10:07.035
Jude, you and I are going to
spend this week getting you ready,

10:07.069 --> 10:09.003
and that way you will ace it for sure.

10:09.038 --> 10:10.805
Deal?

10:13.108 --> 10:16.644
Ok, remember to convert
to a fraction first.

10:16.679 --> 10:18.046
- Good.
- Hey, B.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.714
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:19.748 --> 10:22.817
- How were the batting cages?
- Oh, uh, good, you know.

10:25.788 --> 10:27.588
Yeah? What's up?

10:30.392 --> 10:33.328
Uh, bud? I think we got
some good work done tonight.

10:33.362 --> 10:35.530
So, why don't you run
upstairs and get ready for bed.

10:37.399 --> 10:40.335
- Night, Bud.
- Night Jude, we'll be up in a minute.

10:40.369 --> 10:42.270
What's up, babe?

10:42.304 --> 10:45.106
Uh, um...

10:45.874 --> 10:49.077
Uh, Dad kinda...

10:49.111 --> 10:51.946
asked me to move in with him today.

10:54.817 --> 10:57.652
Wow.

10:57.686 --> 11:00.722
Well, he never mentioned anything to me.

11:00.756 --> 11:05.326
And I really think that he
should have talked to me first.

11:05.361 --> 11:07.095
Yeah. I guess.

11:07.129 --> 11:11.332
Um. All right, well... don't
worry about it. I'll talk to him.

11:11.367 --> 11:14.235
Yeah, ok...

11:14.269 --> 11:18.206
I said, I'd think about it.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.175
Well, there's really
nothing to think about.

11:21.210 --> 11:25.613
I mean, it's not your choice.

11:25.647 --> 11:28.549
It's not really your father's
either, for that matter.

11:28.584 --> 11:31.519
What do you mean, I don't
get a choice? Why not?

11:35.724 --> 11:38.526
Because you're, um...

11:38.560 --> 11:40.361
- you're still a kid.
- I'm 16.

11:40.396 --> 11:41.462
Yes, that's exactly my point.

11:41.497 --> 11:43.131
You're 16, you're not an adult yet.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.933
[muttering] This is bull.

11:46.435 --> 11:48.202
I'm sorry?

11:48.237 --> 11:49.904
This is bull. I should get a say in this.

11:49.938 --> 11:52.140
Well, you don't.

11:52.174 --> 11:54.058
And we are done talking about this.

11:54.093 --> 11:55.977
Oh, right. Ok, we're
done talking about this.

11:56.011 --> 11:58.713
Yeah, 'cause that's, that's
your answer for everything.

11:58.747 --> 12:00.048
Ok, let's just take a deep breath...

12:00.082 --> 12:02.784
Right, B. Because you're a
prisoner being held captive

12:02.818 --> 12:04.652
in this charming Craftsman in Mission Bay.

12:04.686 --> 12:06.654
- Stef...
- What?

12:06.688 --> 12:07.855
When did I ever get to choose anything?

12:07.890 --> 12:10.691
Did I get to choose for you to divorce Dad?

12:10.726 --> 12:12.360
Did I get to choose who
I was gonna live with?

12:12.394 --> 12:14.228
You were five! Come on.

12:14.263 --> 12:17.398
How about choosing if I have two
moms... did I get to choose that?

12:19.468 --> 12:22.170
- That's enough, Brandon.
- Why?

12:22.204 --> 12:25.006
Because I'm not doing exactly
what you want me to do?

12:25.040 --> 12:27.108
No, because you're being disrespectful.

12:27.142 --> 12:28.242
Oh, I'm being disrespectful?

12:28.277 --> 12:30.945
How about you have a little
respect for someone else!

12:30.979 --> 12:32.980
You need to stop talking right now.

12:33.015 --> 12:34.949
Right, of course I do!
Because that's your answer.

12:34.983 --> 12:37.752
Anytime anyone disagrees
with you, it's stop talking!

12:37.786 --> 12:39.020
Be quiet! Do it my way!

12:39.054 --> 12:42.623
You need to watch yourself, young man.

12:42.658 --> 12:44.692
- Watch this, Mom.
- Brandon!

13:00.175 --> 13:02.110

13:02.144 --> 13:03.311

13:23.432 --> 13:25.433
I didn't sell the pills for me.

a new dress or something.

13:29.204 --> 13:31.172

13:34.042 --> 13:35.409

that. You don't walk away.

14:08.076 --> 14:12.046
I know. I'm sorry, too...

14:12.080 --> 14:15.917
for raising my voice. But
that can't ever happen again.

14:15.951 --> 14:19.086
You can get mad at me all you want to,

14:19.121 --> 14:20.955
but you are not allowed to walk away.

14:20.989 --> 14:23.824
It won't happen again. I promise.

14:23.859 --> 14:25.626
Ok.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.530
And, and... for the record,

14:29.565 --> 14:32.466
I... I love having two moms.

14:34.336 --> 14:36.304
That's good.

14:40.008 --> 14:43.311
Um, you really made your point, Brandon.

14:43.345 --> 14:48.849
I spoke with Lena and it's up
to you... where you want to live.

14:48.884 --> 14:51.752
You can stay here, or you
can move in with your Dad.

14:51.787 --> 14:54.855
It's your choice. Just let
us know what you decide.

14:54.890 --> 14:58.960
Well, don't stay up too
long. 'Cause it's late, ok?

14:58.994 --> 15:00.928
- Ok.
- All right, love.

15:11.256 --> 15:14.609
You're back. That was some fight, man.

15:17.546 --> 15:19.347
You heard that?

15:19.381 --> 15:22.283
We all did. So what happened?

15:22.317 --> 15:24.285
They're letting me decide.

15:26.221 --> 15:28.823
Really? Wow.

15:29.992 --> 15:33.060
I mean, moms are gonna
be devastated if you go.

15:33.095 --> 15:35.062
And my Dad will be
devastated if I don't go.

15:36.832 --> 15:37.932
You wanted to choose.

15:40.836 --> 15:42.737
Good luck with that.

15:51.436 --> 15:54.338
I just think, I mean, we're
gonna get a lot more time alone.

15:56.341 --> 15:59.043
I just hope my moms don't get too upset.

15:59.077 --> 16:00.378
Brandon they'll be fine.

16:00.412 --> 16:03.948
Really. You can go visit
them, you know, whenever...

16:03.982 --> 16:06.217

I doubt they'll even notice.

16:09.121 --> 16:11.138
Very good.

16:11.189 --> 16:12.857
I thought you'd have a lot of guilt.

16:12.891 --> 16:13.991
Good. Very nice.

I see some of us are still
wanting for inspiration.

16:31.610 --> 16:34.211
Tell you what, why don't
you and Wyatt come see me

16:34.246 --> 16:37.548
after school today and we can see
if we can get those juices flowing.

16:37.582 --> 16:40.351
- [students laugh]
- That's not what I meant.

16:40.385 --> 16:42.053
You're incorrigible.

16:42.087 --> 16:45.039
Look it up. Every single one of
you should know what that means.

16:45.073 --> 16:47.158
Ok, turn to page 45.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.802
So, we gonna talk about the
elephant in the car or what?

16:58.820 --> 17:01.038
Not much to say. You wanted
Brandon to have a choice. He does.

17:01.072 --> 17:03.007
You could've told him no.

17:03.975 --> 17:06.609
I tried. It didn't go well.

17:07.878 --> 17:10.781
Hey, can I have a breakfast
burrito, extra salsa, please?

17:10.815 --> 17:12.616
- You got it.
- Thank you.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.189
So what, you just gonna be mad at me?

17:18.223 --> 17:19.390
I don't know, Mike.

17:19.424 --> 17:22.326
Do I wish you had talked
to me about it first? Sure.

17:22.361 --> 17:24.462
Would I have agreed to
let B decide? Probably not.

17:24.496 --> 17:27.031
So, maybe this is for the best.

17:27.065 --> 17:29.200
But I'll tell you what you blind-side
me with something like this again

17:29.234 --> 17:31.852
I'm gonna bury you deep in the desert.

17:32.337 --> 17:34.004
Fair enough.

17:34.939 --> 17:36.173
Sucks being blind-sided, don't it?

17:38.977 --> 17:43.914
So, all of this with
Brandon is just payback?

17:43.949 --> 17:46.500
For what? Figuring out
I was gay and leaving?

17:46.535 --> 17:47.835
It's a little late for payback, Stef.

17:47.886 --> 17:50.521
I think so. Mike, come on.

17:50.555 --> 17:53.391
If you're gonna rehash our
marriage for ten hours a day,

17:53.425 --> 17:55.292
I'm going to ask Roberts for
another partner. Seriously.

17:55.310 --> 17:56.494
Stef, it's not payback...

17:57.629 --> 18:02.166
it's regret. It's me growin' up.

18:02.200 --> 18:05.169

25:52.003 --> 25:53.236
Uh, no.

25:55.139 --> 25:57.874
How come? I mean I remember
you used to brag all the time

25:57.908 --> 26:00.910
about milking those guys for beer money...

26:00.945 --> 26:03.013
Ah, you know...

26:03.047 --> 26:06.783
you do something for a
while, people get busy then...

26:06.817 --> 26:10.553
I don't know. You just let it go.

26:10.588 --> 26:12.489
Too bad.

26:12.523 --> 26:14.224
It happens, kid..

26:18.429 --> 26:19.596
I gotta get you home.

26:21.415 --> 26:27.037
I mean, I can text Mom.
So, we can finish the movie.

26:27.071 --> 26:29.072
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:30.141 --> 26:31.274
Ok.

26:38.816 --> 26:42.552
Hey, I got an idea. Let's play a game.

26:42.586 --> 26:43.787
Why don't you run up and grab everybody

26:43.821 --> 26:46.823
and get something out of the game closet?

26:52.730 --> 26:54.531
[doorbell rings]

26:56.467 --> 26:58.234
Hey, Talya. Come on in.

26:58.269 --> 26:59.402
Uh, Brandon's not here, though.

26:59.437 --> 27:01.571
Tonight's the night he has
dinner with his Dad, remember?

27:01.605 --> 27:03.340
Oh, shoot. I forgot.

27:03.374 --> 27:06.142
That's ok. You're welcome to wait
if you want. He should be here soon.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.244
And we're just about to play
a game, if you'd like to join.

27:08.279 --> 27:09.379
- Yeah, sure.
- Ok.

27:09.413 --> 27:11.398
Why don't you throw that
stuff in Brandon's room.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.334
- Hey, Callie!
- Hey...

27:15.386 --> 27:17.053
We're playing a game?

27:17.088 --> 27:19.789
Yes, we are playing a game.

27:19.824 --> 27:20.990
All of us?

27:21.025 --> 27:23.827
Yes, all of us. We used to do
this all the time, remember?

27:23.861 --> 27:24.861
We just got out of the habit,

27:24.895 --> 27:26.663
and I think now that
Callie and Jude are here,

27:26.697 --> 27:27.964
it would be fun to start
the tradition again.

27:27.998 --> 27:29.766
I'm sorry, did somebody say, "Game?"

27:29.800 --> 27:31.434
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

27:31.469 --> 27:32.635
You better get ready to lose, lady.

27:32.670 --> 27:34.604
She always loses.

27:34.638 --> 27:37.707
- See? Fun.
- Fun! Fun for everyone.

27:37.742 --> 27:41.511
They're so much fun. I'm really
gonna miss hanging out here.

27:41.545 --> 27:44.514
You know, now that Brandon's
moving in with his Dad.

27:44.548 --> 27:46.583
Um, have you talked to him lately?

27:46.617 --> 27:49.152
'Cause I just don't think that's happening.

27:51.422 --> 27:55.125
[indistinct chatter]

27:56.327 --> 27:58.962
- [Stef] A boomerang?
- [Callie] A boomerang...

27:58.996 --> 28:03.867
- Really, a boomerang?
- A weapon of some sort.

28:07.671 --> 28:10.940
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

28:10.975 --> 28:12.742
We just started, We saved room for you.

28:12.777 --> 28:14.811
You can be the top hat.

28:16.714 --> 28:17.747
So...

28:19.517 --> 28:23.253
I think I'm gonna move in with my Dad.

28:28.392 --> 28:31.961
Ok. Cool.

28:41.972 --> 28:44.073
All right. Um, before we get started,

28:44.108 --> 28:46.709
uh, does anybody want anything?

28:46.744 --> 28:48.795
I'm gonna get some tea.
Do you want anything?

28:48.846 --> 28:50.713
[Stef] Ok.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.217
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:04.235 --> 29:06.352
So, you're really leaving, huh?

29:06.387 --> 29:08.221
Yeah.

29:08.255 --> 29:10.924
Hey, uh, thanks for letting me use this.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.226
What are you doing?

29:13.260 --> 29:16.095
That wasn't a loaner.

29:16.163 --> 29:17.163
Really?

29:17.198 --> 29:19.799
Yeah, no. It's for you.

29:19.833 --> 29:22.702
I don't know what to say.

29:22.736 --> 29:23.937
You don't have to say anything.

29:23.971 --> 29:25.939
Just make sure you play it.

29:30.511 --> 29:33.613
So, I guess you decided you
need more hot water, huh?

29:33.647 --> 29:35.348
Yeah.

29:40.254 --> 29:43.223
- Well, thanks.
- Yeah. No worries.

29:55.869 --> 29:58.771
So, I'm gonna move the bed to that wall.

29:58.806 --> 30:00.757
Get like a couch in here or something.

30:00.791 --> 30:03.076
Just, really make this
place a serious bachelor pad.

30:04.778 --> 30:07.614
Settle down. This is still my room.

30:07.648 --> 30:09.916
What am I gonna do without you here, man?

30:09.950 --> 30:12.685
It's just gonna be me and a bunch of girls.

30:12.720 --> 30:13.920
And Jude.

30:13.954 --> 30:17.357
Yeah. And Jude.

30:17.391 --> 30:21.294
You'll be fine. Just stay out of trouble.

30:21.328 --> 30:23.630
Yes, you. Stop giving out all your pills

30:23.647 --> 30:25.398
to every cute girl in
school, for one thing.

30:30.504 --> 30:32.338
It wasn't me.

30:32.373 --> 30:35.241
- What?
- It was Mariana.

30:35.259 --> 30:37.210
You're joking, right?

30:37.244 --> 30:39.946
She wanted to have some money
to give to our birth mom.

30:39.980 --> 30:41.848
What the hell, man. What are you doing?

30:41.882 --> 30:45.051
Why would she do that? And why
would you take the blame for her?

30:45.085 --> 30:47.954
Mariana asked me to go with
her to tell Moms what she did.

30:47.988 --> 30:51.057
She was just about to say something.

30:51.091 --> 30:53.626
I looked over at her face,

30:53.661 --> 30:55.695
just at her stupid, scared face.

30:55.729 --> 30:59.499
It looked just like it did when we
moved into our first foster house.

30:59.533 --> 31:01.601
And I couldn't let her do it.

31:01.635 --> 31:04.270
I mean, everyone's always
mad at me all the time anyway.

31:04.305 --> 31:05.922
So, I figured, what does it matter?

31:05.973 --> 31:06.884
But at least it's over.

31:06.885 --> 31:10.410
All of this being grounded,
and In-School Suspension...

31:10.444 --> 31:13.446
it was totally worth it, now that she
knows what a loser our birth mom is.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.083
I mean, you know some day you're gonna
have to let Mariana fend for herself.

31:17.117 --> 31:18.251
[Mariana] I never touched it!

31:18.285 --> 31:20.053
[Callie] Why would you do that?

31:20.087 --> 31:21.854
- Good luck with those two.
- [Callie] It was moved!

31:21.889 --> 31:23.056
No one else has even been in here!

31:23.090 --> 31:25.141
- I never touched it!
- Hey! Enough shouting!

31:25.175 --> 31:26.826
What is going on?

31:26.860 --> 31:28.961
- She read my journal.
- No, I didn't.

31:28.996 --> 31:31.848
Well, somebody did. I left it right here

31:31.882 --> 31:33.866
second from the bottom and
when I came back, it was moved.

31:33.901 --> 31:36.636
- Well, it wasn't me.
- Mariana, tell me the truth...

31:36.670 --> 31:38.771
I am! I never touched it.

31:38.806 --> 31:42.875
Ok, Callie is it possible that it wasn't
really moved? That you just think it was?

31:42.910 --> 31:45.812
Why? Because Perfect Mariana
could never do anything wrong?

31:45.846 --> 31:49.282
Yeah, maybe you should get to
know your daughter a bit better.

31:49.316 --> 31:51.217
[Lena] Wait, what does that mean?

31:58.225 --> 32:01.427
You know what? Forget
it. Don't worry about it.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.296
You're probably right.
It was probably my fault.

32:03.330 --> 32:05.031
I just forgot or something, probably.

32:10.904 --> 32:12.972
I can't live with her.

32:13.006 --> 32:15.041
Well, you have to. So, figure it out.

32:16.043 --> 32:17.777
Why'd you have to get so mad?

32:17.811 --> 32:19.612
Why can't you just get along with her?

32:19.646 --> 32:22.515
- She read my journal.
- What do you care?

32:22.549 --> 32:25.585
- It's just a stupid journal.
- See for yourself.

32:30.391 --> 32:32.225
You wrote about Liam?

33:23.594 --> 33:26.345
He said he wants a hostile act...

33:37.257 --> 33:39.358
Time's up, Jude. You all done?

33:43.180 --> 33:45.832
I'll correct it, and I'll let you know.

33:48.936 --> 33:51.771
I only need a 65 and I can stay, right?

33:52.806 --> 33:56.809
Yes... listen to me.

33:56.844 --> 34:00.813
Whatever happens, I'm
really proud of you, ok?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.885
Go on, get to class.
I'll come find you later.

Brandon?

36:26.194 --> 36:28.062
Playing basketball? Oh, boy.

36:28.096 --> 36:30.063
He hasn't done that since
he failed that final.

36:30.098 --> 36:32.049
I think he's feeling guilty.

36:32.100 --> 36:34.735
- About what? About leaving us?
- About leaving you.

36:34.769 --> 36:36.870
Oh, please.

36:39.641 --> 36:40.908
Go talk to him, Stef.

36:40.942 --> 36:43.610
What am I supposed to say?

36:43.644 --> 36:47.714
He wanted a choice, he got
a choice. He made a choice.

36:47.732 --> 36:51.318
I'm doing the best I can...

36:51.352 --> 36:52.720
That's not good enough.

36:52.754 --> 36:55.222
- What do you mean?
- You don't get to do this.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.192
- Do what?
- You don't get to have hurt feelings and pout.

36:58.226 --> 36:59.393
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

36:59.427 --> 37:02.496
You have to step up. You
have to go help your son.

37:02.530 --> 37:06.433
You have to put away whatever
it is you might be feeling,

37:06.468 --> 37:09.103
and be the better person.

37:09.137 --> 37:11.238
'Cause that's what parents do.

37:20.982 --> 37:22.616
Oh.

37:22.634 --> 37:24.585
- Lucky.
- Oh, please.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.571
I've been known to shoot a
basketball or two, my friend.

37:29.824 --> 37:32.726
You and Dad were such
jocks. What happened to me?

37:32.761 --> 37:34.595
Oh, come on. You got
the more important stuff.

37:34.629 --> 37:37.664
You're funny and smart
and talented as hell.

37:37.699 --> 37:39.733
And more than that, you're kind.

37:39.768 --> 37:42.486
And you know who you are.

37:44.572 --> 37:46.406
You know what makes you happy.

37:46.441 --> 37:50.210
That's an amazing thing for someone
your age, B. Don't take that lightly.

37:53.515 --> 37:56.984
Just do what makes you happy, B, ok?

37:57.018 --> 38:00.187
You do that and I'll be fine, I
promise. That's the way it works.

38:00.221 --> 38:03.907
You don't, have to take care
of me or your Dad or Lena.

38:03.942 --> 38:06.160
It's the other way around.

38:11.933 --> 38:14.535
[Stef and Brandon playing basketball]

38:28.483 --> 38:30.284
I didn't read your journal.

38:32.620 --> 38:37.224
I know you don't believe
me, and that's fine.

38:37.258 --> 38:39.259
I mean, why should you?

38:39.294 --> 38:42.362
I'm just the latest girl you've
been forced to share a room with.

38:43.531 --> 38:46.300
I remember what that was like.

38:46.334 --> 38:49.169
Being passed around all the time.

38:49.237 --> 38:51.972
I don't think I ever felt
safe until I got here.

38:52.006 --> 38:55.042
It took me a long time to trust anybody.

38:56.077 --> 38:58.011
So, I get it.

39:00.148 --> 39:02.049
But I didn't read your journal.

39:09.591 --> 39:10.858
[Mike] Yeah, comin'!

39:12.861 --> 39:14.828
Hey. What's going on?

39:14.863 --> 39:18.432
I thought we weren't
moving you in till tomorrow?

39:18.466 --> 39:22.736
Um, yeah, um... about that.

39:26.441 --> 39:27.541
You ok?

39:27.575 --> 39:33.113
Yeah... I just. I, uh, I can't...

39:35.350 --> 39:37.117
You can't what?

39:39.153 --> 39:41.121
Move in with you.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.792
Ok.

39:45.827 --> 39:48.061
I just, I'm sorry.

39:49.797 --> 39:50.964
It's ok!

39:52.700 --> 39:58.038
I just, I can't leave
Mom... and everybody else.

39:58.072 --> 40:00.707
Don't worry about it.

40:00.742 --> 40:04.478
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

40:04.512 --> 40:08.782
Look, listen... this was never
supposed to be a bad thing.

40:08.816 --> 40:14.388
You do what you gotta do.
I'm gonna be all right.

40:14.422 --> 40:16.657
I mean it.

40:18.393 --> 40:19.526
Ok?

40:30.571 --> 40:32.439
Is that a, uh...

40:32.473 --> 40:34.207
is it a piano?

40:34.242 --> 40:37.444
Oh yeah, yeah. I rented it.

40:37.478 --> 40:43.050
But it's fine. You can
come play whenever you want.

40:51.192 --> 40:52.459
I'm sorry.

41:06.007 --> 41:07.975
Oh, about time.

41:09.143 --> 41:11.962
[Lexi] Sorry my parents
wouldn't let me come.

41:18.953 --> 41:22.222
- Hurry up. We've been waiting forever.
- Ok, we were making popcorn.

41:22.256 --> 41:24.057
Unless, of course, you don't want any?

41:24.092 --> 41:26.326
I don't think they want any.
We'll just have this for us.

41:26.361 --> 41:28.028
- I'll take some.
- Come on...

41:28.062 --> 41:30.931
- All right, ask nicely.
- [Stef] Pass that down.

41:30.965 --> 41:33.166
Here we go, here we go...

41:33.201 --> 41:35.185
- [Stef] This is ours.
- Jude?

41:35.236 --> 41:37.938
Pass it down, pass it down...

41:40.024 --> 41:42.376
- What you working on?
- English homework.

41:42.410 --> 41:44.211
I have to write a story,

41:44.245 --> 41:46.279
and I need a name for the bad guy.

41:46.314 --> 41:48.382
You know we busted this dealer.

41:48.416 --> 41:50.350
Uh, his name... really bad
guy. His name was Freddy.

41:50.385 --> 41:53.286
- That's a good name.
- What about Sanchez?

41:53.321 --> 41:56.957
Like your boss? No, no, no.
Jude, you cannot use that.

41:56.991 --> 41:59.993
Does it have to be a
boy? Or can it be a girl?

42:00.011 --> 42:01.294
How about Liam?

42:08.219 --> 42:10.170
Hear one you like?

42:11.906 --> 42:15.042
Good. All right, Lena.
Back in your seat. Let's go.

42:15.076 --> 42:18.345
No talking. Anybody.
Quiet. I've killed for less.

42:18.379 --> 42:20.313
Talking during the movie.

42:20.348 --> 42:22.182
- [Lena] What about you?
- [Stef] Hm?

42:22.216 --> 42:25.986
All right, here we go. Movie is starting.

42:26.020 --> 42:26.987
<i>[Peter Bradley Adams: Family Name]</i>

42:27.021 --> 42:29.222
<i>* They all end up the same *</i>

42:29.257 --> 42:33.994
<i>* So rest your hearts
on the family name *</i>

42:34.028 --> 42:37.998
<i>* And we'll find our way back home *</i>
