01:49.318 --> 01:50.851
Vic's name's Christina Hollis.

01:50.921 --> 01:52.665
She's a sales agent for the building.

01:52.815 --> 01:55.059
Neighbor said she just came
running out of her unit,

01:55.149 --> 01:56.843
delirious and hysterical.

01:57.123 --> 01:58.115
Sexual assault?

01:58.255 --> 01:59.147
Definitely.

01:59.297 --> 02:00.650
I'm gonna go with her to the hospital,

02:00.750 --> 02:01.882
see if I can get a statement.

02:07.594 --> 02:08.716
Video cameras.

02:08.906 --> 02:09.988
That's good for us.

02:10.359 --> 02:12.633
Vic probably thought it
was good for her, too.

02:13.084 --> 02:15.198
Excuse me, hi, can you identify
yourself for the camera, please?

02:15.299 --> 02:16.441
Just look right in the lens.

02:17.002 --> 02:17.854
What is this?

02:17.894 --> 02:19.076
It's a reality crime show.

02:19.176 --> 02:20.809
We're following you
for this investigation.

02:20.909 --> 02:22.503
Sheriff promised full cooperation.

02:22.703 --> 02:24.807
We got that memo. They're hard crime.

02:24.907 --> 02:25.719
That's us-

02:25.739 --> 02:26.390
we're the guys who put the folks

02:26.420 --> 02:28.584
who look in the microscopes
under the microscopes.

02:30.278 --> 02:30.899
Right.

02:31.881 --> 02:33.524
You see, it's good
P.R. For the department.

02:33.624 --> 02:35.027
Try not to bust their chops, okay?

02:35.127 --> 02:35.919
You ever see the show?

02:36.019 --> 02:37.071
It's got a lot of forensics.

02:37.121 --> 02:38.734
There's too many forensics shows on tv.

02:43.283 --> 02:46.119
The door knob, the frame, the
strike plate are all clean.

02:46.269 --> 02:47.712
No sign of a forced entry.

02:47.812 --> 02:49.545
So she might have known her assailant.

02:49.786 --> 02:52.040
Either that or he talked his way in.

02:54.284 --> 02:55.527
Hey, hey, hey.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.230
Stay behind the crime tape.

02:59.154 --> 02:59.865
Don't cut.

03:00.476 --> 03:01.549
Don't get out of that!

03:19.393 --> 03:21.317
Mr. Grissom, can you please
describe what you're seeing?

03:23.511 --> 03:24.684
A long night.

04:02.953 --> 04:04.772
I don't understand.

04:09.627 --> 04:10.567
Why am I here?

04:13.515 --> 04:16.322
Miss Hollis, you've been assaulted.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.878
Who?.. I...

04:22.427 --> 04:23.916
You don't know who did this?

04:26.544 --> 04:28.313
What was the last thing you remember?

04:38.174 --> 04:39.034
I don't know.

04:43.330 --> 04:44.879
Oh, my God.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.665
Oh, my God.

04:53.102 --> 04:54.511
Okay, this isn't right.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.708
Why isn't this right?
Why don't I look right?

04:57.998 --> 04:59.161
Christina, it's okay.

04:59.196 --> 05:00.325
No, it's not okay.

05:00.326 --> 05:02.012
It's not okay.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.070
Why don't I look right?
I don't underst...

05:07.910 --> 05:10.858
Why are they st... why
are they staring at me?

05:11.007 --> 05:12.825
Stop looking at me!

05:13.804 --> 05:15.074
Nurse, get in here!

05:15.223 --> 05:18.830
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Don't stare at me...

05:19.490 --> 05:21.029
I did a wet mount from a vaginal swab

05:21.129 --> 05:23.047
and got 4-plus motile sperm present.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.256
So she was raped within
the last few hours.

05:25.395 --> 05:27.683
No condom means he's not in the system

05:27.823 --> 05:29.422
or he doesn't care if he gets caught.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.291
Guys like this, they keep doing it.

05:31.341 --> 05:33.059
Excuse me, detective.
Can I ask you a question?

05:33.159 --> 05:34.378
Detective.

05:34.757 --> 05:36.536
You try something like
that again and you're gone.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.125
I don't a give a damn
what the sheriff says.

05:38.175 --> 05:40.423
We never put anyone on screen
without a signed release.

05:40.513 --> 05:43.330
You invaded her privacy at
her most vulnerable moment.

05:43.370 --> 05:45.299
I am trying to give the crime a face.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.117
Yeah, well, we're going to lose an hour

05:47.317 --> 05:48.526
waiting for her to calm down.

05:48.626 --> 05:49.655
That's on you.

05:49.726 --> 05:51.693
I apologize. It won't happen again.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.522
Look, can I just ask you
what you've got there?

05:53.662 --> 05:56.930
It's a sexual assault
evidence kit and blood sample.

05:57.079 --> 06:00.456
I've seen date rape victims
in similar dissociative states.

06:00.507 --> 06:02.462
We're going to run a tox
screen, see if she was drugged.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.800
You were a CSI, right?

06:03.835 --> 06:04.852
Yeah.

06:04.853 --> 06:06.053
And now you're a detective.

06:06.193 --> 06:08.024
So which side of the
fence do you prefer?

06:08.773 --> 06:10.174
It's the same side.

06:52.856 --> 06:54.597
Candles burned down.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.837
A bouquet in the trash.

06:59.278 --> 07:01.799
Flowers and candles
sure seems like a date.

07:03.629 --> 07:04.659
Some date.

07:15.932 --> 07:17.333
there's a void in the wax.

07:34.407 --> 07:36.768
Some kind of white flaky substance.

07:50.842 --> 07:52.573
This looks like blood, but...

08:01.245 --> 08:02.695
I think it's nail polish.

08:15.919 --> 08:16.949
Hey, how's it going?

08:19.950 --> 08:20.930
According to your supervisor,

08:21.030 --> 08:23.601
you were doing maintenance work
on the 11th floor at 5:00 a. m.

08:24.681 --> 08:26.791
What were you fixing
at 5:00 in the morning?

08:26.982 --> 08:28.772
I was just clocking a little overtime.

08:32.052 --> 08:33.222
Management said they wanted

08:33.352 --> 08:35.683
a few extra coats of paint
on three, seven and 11.

08:36.032 --> 08:38.283
Got to keep everything nice
a nd pretty for the tenants.

08:38.563 --> 08:40.813
You know, the security guy
didn't see you on his camera.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.703
Why is that?

08:41.804 --> 08:44.164
Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much.

08:44.254 --> 08:45.525
Service elevator's out.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.165
We have to use the stairs.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.556
God forbid the tenants ever
have to look at one of us.

08:50.216 --> 08:52.557
You got a master key
to all the apartments?

08:53.433 --> 08:54.067
Yeah.

08:54.217 --> 08:55.987
But we only go in if
a tenant specifically

08:56.128 --> 08:58.278
asks us to fix something.

08:58.428 --> 09:01.088
You ever fix anything
for Christina Hollis?

09:01.259 --> 09:02.989
No. Never.

09:13.502 --> 09:15.702
You're running a little
low on duct tape, my man.

09:16.262 --> 09:17.113
Yeah.

09:17.352 --> 09:18.893
It's holding up half the building.

09:29.745 --> 09:31.385
Two pieces of duct tape,

09:31.476 --> 09:34.006
both have been swabbed
for DNA and fingerprinted.

09:34.057 --> 09:36.117
Grissom wants you to compare adhesives.

09:36.187 --> 09:37.547
He's looking for a match.

09:38.347 --> 09:39.047
Okay.

09:39.308 --> 09:41.048
That'll take a laser ablation test.

09:41.088 --> 09:41.908
That's good.

09:42.588 --> 09:43.658
Why's that good?

09:43.758 --> 09:47.629
Well, laser ablation is
both visual and dramatic.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.780
Are you looking for the
video crew right now?

09:52.581 --> 09:54.871
I would think that they
would be looking for me.

09:55.112 --> 09:57.172
Relax, man, the show's
only an hour long.

09:57.232 --> 10:00.142
Laser ablation takes, like, six.

10:00.226 --> 10:01.966
Yeah, but when they cut it together,

10:02.056 --> 10:03.887
it'll only take 30 seconds.

10:45.228 --> 10:48.130
Ran laser ablation on
the duct tape samples.

10:48.229 --> 10:49.350
Not a match.

10:49.450 --> 10:52.121
So she wasn't tied up with
the maintenance man's tape.

10:52.211 --> 10:53.622
What about the rest of the trace?

10:53.711 --> 10:55.822
White powder was primarily biological,

10:55.872 --> 10:57.372
so I kicked it back to dna.

10:57.512 --> 10:59.583
It did contain some glassy particles.

10:59.723 --> 11:01.364
Might be industrial diamonds.

11:01.454 --> 11:03.285
And the yellow reflective flakes?

11:03.384 --> 11:05.355
My next priority.

11:07.506 --> 11:08.656
that's a waste of film.

11:08.745 --> 11:11.047
The victim came out of her
apartment around 5:00 a. m.,

11:11.146 --> 11:13.437
So I've been working
my way back from then.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.547
In the previous seven hours,

11:15.638 --> 11:18.239
37 people came and went
from the 11th floor,

11:18.359 --> 11:19.849
21 of them male.

11:20.129 --> 11:22.570
So the assailant could
be any one of them...

11:22.709 --> 11:24.670
assuming that our guy
didn't take the stairs

11:24.720 --> 11:26.270
which, of course, aren't monitored.

11:26.371 --> 11:28.472
Okay, now, here:

11:28.582 --> 11:31.712
This guy got off on the
vic's floor at 10:32 p. m.

11:31.852 --> 11:34.243
There's no footage of
him coming back down.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.463
And check this out.

11:41.975 --> 11:44.356
He brought flowers. How romantic.

11:45.156 --> 11:47.517
But I don't think this was a first date.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.391
guy had his own key.

11:59.721 --> 12:00.998
So he could've been with
the victim the whole night.

12:02.451 --> 12:04.185
Pull the best image of his face you can,

12:04.335 --> 12:05.746
and get a printout to Brass.

12:05.781 --> 12:07.029
I'm on it

12:07.030 --> 12:08.202
Ms. Willows, hold on a second.

12:08.293 --> 12:10.497
All you have is a guy's face.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.290
How do you figure out who he is?

12:13.272 --> 12:14.394
Good question.

12:28.524 --> 12:30.027
So what have you found so far?

12:30.117 --> 12:34.015
I lifted two identifiable
prints off the bouquet wrapper.

12:34.345 --> 12:36.138
How do you know they
belong to the suspect?

12:36.889 --> 12:37.731
We don't,

12:37.881 --> 12:41.068
but one matched a print
found on the duct tape,

12:41.909 --> 12:42.711
right here,

12:43.743 --> 12:45.616
used to tape up the victim.

12:46.408 --> 12:49.123
Unfortunately, that
print's not in our database.

12:49.694 --> 12:51.627
So your suspect doesn't have a record?

12:53.195 --> 12:54.403
Apparently not, no.

12:55.064 --> 12:56.978
Well, how do you find a
guy who's not in the system?

12:58.861 --> 13:01.486
you just got to get creative, you know?

13:01.627 --> 13:03.039
I mean, the flowers...

13:04.642 --> 13:07.597
came from a small shop off-strip.

13:08.529 --> 13:12.086
Took the suspect's image to
the clerk, showed it to him.

13:12.136 --> 13:13.729
He gave me a credit card receipt.

13:13.869 --> 13:15.893
From that receipt, I got a name.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.220
That name gave me a driver's license.

13:19.430 --> 13:20.693
Dwight Reynolds.

13:21.324 --> 13:22.966
Police are bringing him in now.

13:24.229 --> 13:25.201
Great, okay.

13:25.237 --> 13:26.508
Clear and concise, thank you.

13:26.733 --> 13:28.387
Thanks. Yeah, well,

13:28.497 --> 13:29.990
we have to do it in court all the time.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.403
If you can't explain it to a jury,

13:31.513 --> 13:33.306
then the bad guy usually walks,

13:33.447 --> 13:35.460
and we don't like it
when the bad guy walks.

13:36.122 --> 13:37.604
Unit picked him up at the double down.

13:37.644 --> 13:38.776
He was plastered.

13:39.247 --> 13:39.897
What'd he blow?

13:39.932 --> 13:40.812
One nine.

13:41.972 --> 13:44.407
That's almost enough
to wash away your sins.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.461
Well, we're going to have
wait until he sobers up.

13:46.611 --> 13:48.675
No, no, let's not wait,
let's move on this.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.128
I think we got a chance.

13:50.218 --> 13:53.363
Look, why don't you
come in there with me?

13:53.654 --> 13:55.568
Maybe pop a few buttons?

13:55.718 --> 13:57.221
no, seriously.

13:57.361 --> 13:58.583
See how he reacts.

14:00.076 --> 14:01.579
If he tries too hard not to look,

14:01.679 --> 14:02.795
it could be a guilty conscience?

14:02.795 --> 14:04.480
Yeah, maybe, something like that.

14:04.972 --> 14:07.509
If he is the guy, and
we interview him now,

14:07.559 --> 14:09.625
anything he says could
be thrown out of court.

14:10.938 --> 14:11.981
It's worth a try.

14:12.072 --> 14:13.565
What do you think?

14:16.715 --> 14:17.366
Let's go.

14:27.735 --> 14:28.528
How's it going?

14:30.262 --> 14:32.148
Did you know a Christina Hollis?

14:32.478 --> 14:34.725
Yeah, we used to date.

14:35.055 --> 14:36.419
You seen her recently?

14:37.171 --> 14:37.974
No.

14:38.254 --> 14:41.322
Then how come we found your prints
on some flowers at her place?

14:42.265 --> 14:43.723
I dropped some flowers off...

14:43.758 --> 14:45.182
but I didn't see her when I did.

14:45.284 --> 14:46.441
You had a key?

14:46.476 --> 14:47.366
Yeah.

14:48.302 --> 14:50.789
She likes me to come
over sometimes, you know?

14:51.261 --> 14:52.715
Help her move stuff.

15:02.141 --> 15:04.347
Oh, come on, what really happened?

15:04.487 --> 15:06.222
You went over to move some stuff,

15:06.372 --> 15:08.950
and she wasn't in the mood, is that it?

15:09.050 --> 15:11.768
I told you
- I didn't see her.

15:26.730 --> 15:28.735
She was playing Barry White.

15:29.938 --> 15:31.814
Everybody knows what that means.

15:33.358 --> 15:34.583
I guess it wasn't my night.

15:34.618 --> 15:35.647
You're lying!

15:36.993 --> 15:39.274
We found the flowers inside
her apartment, in the trash,

15:39.414 --> 15:41.671
and you didn't use
the elevator to leave.

15:42.001 --> 15:43.506
I was pissed.

15:43.787 --> 15:45.391
I tried to walk it off.

15:45.631 --> 15:47.317
I figured 11 flights down,

15:47.507 --> 15:49.753
it's better than a cold shower.

15:50.044 --> 15:51.970
Christina hollis was tied up

15:52.110 --> 15:54.437
and brutally assaulted in
her apartment last night.

15:54.587 --> 15:55.660
What?

15:55.710 --> 15:56.973
And you were there.

15:57.586 --> 15:58.183
Is she...?

15:58.218 --> 16:00.199
She's alive and talking.

16:00.453 --> 16:02.047
Last night?

16:02.327 --> 16:04.572
The guy who with her was...

16:05.795 --> 16:07.289
was doing that to her?

16:13.596 --> 16:15.100
I could've stopped it.

16:18.899 --> 16:20.443
So the powder that you
found on the bedroom floor

16:20.533 --> 16:22.278
was actually keratinized skin cells.

16:22.378 --> 16:23.270
They belong to the vic,

16:23.361 --> 16:25.757
and morphology suggests that
they're probably from her cuticles.

16:25.858 --> 16:26.799
Cuticles?

16:27.080 --> 16:29.517
Nail polish, diamond particles...

16:30.228 --> 16:33.556
maybe she was giving herself a
mani and pedi before the assault.

16:33.708 --> 16:34.549
I don't know about you,

16:34.640 --> 16:36.244
but if I could afford to live
in an apartment like that,

16:36.344 --> 16:37.557
I'd be in a spa every week.

16:37.728 --> 16:39.272
Yeah, I hear you there. Thank you.

16:42.510 --> 16:45.137
Wendy ran the semen, no hits in codis.

16:45.888 --> 16:49.357
Yeah, the, ex-boyfriend
didn't match any of the prints

16:49.508 --> 16:50.681
on the duct tape, either.

16:50.771 --> 16:54.250
Sae found oral, vaginal and
anal smears positive for semen.

16:54.390 --> 16:57.960
Degraded and intact sperm
suggests multiple deposits.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.379
Which means that he probably
raped her on and off,

17:01.479 --> 17:02.612
for a long time.

17:02.792 --> 17:07.303
Yeah, well, tox came back
- lorazepam in the vic's blood.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.599
I didn't find any prescription
bottles in her apartment.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.973
No, nor did I.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.409
Lorazepam is a hypnotic sedative,

17:13.509 --> 17:15.766
and I know in high doses,
it causes acute amnesia.

17:15.856 --> 17:18.442
Maybe that's what he was
counting on to cover his tracks.

17:18.593 --> 17:21.630
Well, it usually takes an hour
for a drug like that to kick in.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.375
How did he subdue her in the meantime?

17:24.317 --> 17:27.224
Low-profile entry,
sedatives, duct tape-

17:27.375 --> 17:30.373
I mean, if he's not a
serial, he will be soon.

17:39.988 --> 17:41.582
Hey, there, gorgeous.

17:42.213 --> 17:43.847
I'm going to be running with the trace

17:43.947 --> 17:45.171
from the victim's apartment.

17:45.311 --> 17:47.146
Would you mind bringing me up to speed?

17:47.296 --> 17:48.088
Certainly.

17:49.873 --> 17:50.956
Take your time.

17:52.310 --> 17:53.512
Did you page us?

17:54.635 --> 17:55.347
No.

17:57.432 --> 18:00.766
According to the gas
chromatograph mass spectrometer,

18:00.907 --> 18:04.954
the glossy red drop you
found on the footboard was...

18:05.004 --> 18:05.988
nail polish.

18:06.138 --> 18:09.422
Well, that's not unusual
in a woman's apartment.

18:09.663 --> 18:13.660
What is far more intriguing is
the reflective yellow flakes.

18:13.800 --> 18:17.235
Follow me to the fourier
transform infrared microscope.

18:17.325 --> 18:18.713
Hodges, what's wrong with you?

18:18.748 --> 18:19.529
Nothing.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.466
Guys... stay with the girl.

18:26.121 --> 18:29.404
As you can see, the flakes are

18:29.546 --> 18:33.019
fluorescent reflective lenses
bonded to an aramid backing

18:33.121 --> 18:34.958
by a special polymer layer.

18:35.058 --> 18:40.541
And it's used exclusively in the
reflective trim of firemen's turnouts.

18:41.944 --> 18:45.080
You're telling me there was a
firefighter in the victim's bedroom.

18:49.117 --> 18:51.697
Thanks. Thanks, Hodges.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.154
Anytime.

19:00.714 --> 19:03.138
Yeah, all right, okay, let 'em roll.

19:03.173 --> 19:04.646
But you're buying the lobster.

19:04.681 --> 19:05.580
Yeah, right.

19:06.067 --> 19:08.366
See, one of the guys gets on tv,

19:08.486 --> 19:11.249
that guy has to buy lobster
for the whole company, you know?

19:11.399 --> 19:12.563
These guys eat well-

19:12.765 --> 19:15.536
Lobster thermidor! Check it out.

19:15.716 --> 19:19.713
So, according to dispatch,
you responded to an alarm

19:19.833 --> 19:21.380
at the Omni condos last night?

19:21.481 --> 19:23.078
Yeah, at 6:58 p. m.

19:23.168 --> 19:25.146
We were on scene in about four minutes.

19:25.357 --> 19:27.114
Three smoke bombs on
three different floors,

19:27.215 --> 19:28.530
three pains in my ass.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.930
There's no major damage,
just paint and wallpaper.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.296
We were there about a half hour.

19:32.396 --> 19:33.852
What'd the arson guys find?

19:33.943 --> 19:35.409
They didn't find much.

19:35.499 --> 19:37.808
The smoke bombs were
made out of soda cans.

19:37.949 --> 19:40.299
Kids, internet, you do the math.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.825
It's all in your lab.

19:41.975 --> 19:43.893
Really? What for?

19:44.044 --> 19:45.681
A couple guys from the
day shift were gonna

19:45.782 --> 19:48.081
compare 'em to those bombs we
found a couple of weeks ago.

19:48.232 --> 19:49.356
What are you talking about?

19:49.457 --> 19:51.385
Apartment building over on Paradise.

19:51.435 --> 19:53.594
Smoke bombs started a
fire, one woman died.

19:53.694 --> 19:55.592
We still don't have a suspect in that.

19:56.435 --> 19:57.439
Were you on the scene?

19:57.540 --> 19:58.575
I saw it after.

19:58.765 --> 20:02.099
Smoke bomb was too close to
the wall, the whole place...

20:09.198 --> 20:11.417
which of your guys were up
on the 11th floor at the omni?

20:11.417 --> 20:12.313
I don't know.

20:12.403 --> 20:13.681
I'd have to ask around. Why?

20:13.833 --> 20:15.856
A woman was raped last night.

20:17.787 --> 20:19.228
You think one of my guys did it?

20:19.264 --> 20:20.342
I'm not saying that,

20:20.343 --> 20:22.799
but we found some evidence
that a fireman was near her bed.

20:22.849 --> 20:24.078
You came here

20:24.168 --> 20:26.674
to accuse my guys of this
in front of the camera?

20:26.815 --> 20:28.495
No, no, no. Settle down, settle down...

20:28.536 --> 20:29.814
The hell I will.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.997
No wonder they call you brass,
because you really got a set.

20:35.087 --> 20:36.399
come on, Sparky...

20:36.435 --> 20:37.713
Excuse me, gentlemen.

20:37.714 --> 20:39.827
Captain, which of your guys...

20:39.918 --> 20:42.283
wears a yellow reflective
stripe on their turnouts?

20:42.343 --> 20:44.517
Nobody, department's color is orange.

20:46.359 --> 20:48.291
The reflective flake we found

20:48.382 --> 20:51.210
in Christina Hollis'
apartment was yellow.

20:51.412 --> 20:53.756
Then you're not looking
for a las vegas fireman.

20:54.843 --> 20:55.929
According to surveillance,

20:56.020 --> 20:58.758
the victim came home at 6:19 p. m.

20:59.672 --> 21:03.981
And the firemen were in her
building at approximately 7:00.

21:04.182 --> 21:05.078
They took the stairs,

21:05.178 --> 21:06.829
so we don't have them on this camera.

21:07.111 --> 21:09.567
Now take a look at this...

21:11.277 --> 21:13.260
Parking stucture entrance.

21:13.441 --> 21:15.051
Well, he certainly looks the part.

21:17.466 --> 21:19.399
He touched the door with his bare hands.

21:19.922 --> 21:21.331
Might get prints.

21:23.167 --> 21:25.498
The time code says 6:36 p. m.

21:25.608 --> 21:28.205
But the alarm went out at 6:58.

21:28.556 --> 21:30.579
That's 22 minutes later.

21:30.912 --> 21:33.368
What kind of fireman
comes before the fire?

21:34.142 --> 21:35.884
Someone who knows it's coming.

21:37.434 --> 21:39.034
mr. Grissom, we may have missed that.

21:39.134 --> 21:40.976
Could you say it one
more time for camera?

21:48.725 --> 21:51.412
You ever hear the saying,
"only the dumb ones get caught?"

21:51.795 --> 21:52.680
Yeah...

21:52.972 --> 21:54.905
but we catch the smart ones, too.

21:55.096 --> 21:57.873
And this guy's definitely smart.

21:59.705 --> 22:02.201
He lights smoke bombs
on three different floors

22:02.301 --> 22:04.707
so as not to call
attention to his target.

22:04.938 --> 22:09.909
Victim sees the smoke, sees
him, and opens the door.

22:16.434 --> 22:18.395
Fire department, open up.

22:19.677 --> 22:21.509
I mean, who wouldn't
trust a fireman, right?

22:27.014 --> 22:29.496
It takes a lot of courage to do this.

22:31.108 --> 22:32.089
Thank you.

22:33.070 --> 22:34.731
And if you change your
mind about the camera,

22:34.842 --> 22:38.075
all you have to do is say so
no one ever has to see this.

22:39.256 --> 22:43.791
No, I want him to see it.
He'll watch it in jail.

22:45.382 --> 22:51.028
Okay, so, you said you were
beginning to remember what happened?

22:51.728 --> 22:52.950
Yeah, a little.

22:54.962 --> 22:56.793
Can you tell me what he looked like?

23:03.860 --> 23:05.412
No, not really.

23:06.632 --> 23:10.277
It's mostly, just feelings.

23:11.598 --> 23:12.579
Feelings.

23:13.470 --> 23:14.451
Of what?

23:17.544 --> 23:19.045
I know he raped me.

23:25.591 --> 23:27.234
What I remember most...

23:29.675 --> 23:31.637
it was, he...

23:50.285 --> 23:51.737
he kept...

23:52.448 --> 23:54.339
he kept touching my feet.

23:59.975 --> 24:01.807
he kept touching my feet.

24:12.188 --> 24:14.624
a foot fetish is a visual pathology.

24:14.764 --> 24:17.211
The suspect would have had
to be close enough to the vic

24:17.311 --> 24:19.928
to see her toes and then get aroused.

24:20.078 --> 24:21.251
We live in a desert, Gil.

24:21.341 --> 24:22.665
You want to see a woman's bare feet,

24:22.785 --> 24:24.469
all you have to do is look down.

24:34.223 --> 24:37.251
door in the parking structure was
like the arm of a slot machine:

24:37.331 --> 24:38.555
Smudge city.

24:38.795 --> 24:40.740
Anything useful from the janitor?

24:40.830 --> 24:42.685
Yeah, he gave us a full description.

24:42.825 --> 24:44.419
Said he looked like a fireman.

24:45.222 --> 24:49.562
well, between ebay, uniform
shops, and national manufacturers,

24:49.702 --> 24:51.597
there's about a hundred
different places.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.482
that you can buy
yellow-striped turnouts

24:53.572 --> 24:55.777
Maybe he was a fireman in another city.

24:56.069 --> 24:56.770
Maybe.

24:59.066 --> 25:00.099
What's that?

25:00.239 --> 25:01.753
When I was at the firehouse,

25:01.893 --> 25:03.728
all of the air tanks

25:03.818 --> 25:06.584
were rigged with the valves
on the bottom, like this one.

25:06.736 --> 25:10.815
But our guy... his valve is on top.

25:11.707 --> 25:14.334
A real fireman probably
wouldn't make that mistake.

25:14.425 --> 25:16.590
His air line isn't
even rigged to his mask.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.177
It's rigged to a
second mask on his side.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.367
Maybe he put something
in the tank to subdue her.

25:23.798 --> 25:25.342
He used lorazepam.

25:25.773 --> 25:26.896
Eventually.

25:27.046 --> 25:28.630
But this guy was somehow able to get her

25:28.730 --> 25:31.176
from the door to the
bed without a struggle.

25:33.713 --> 25:35.778
I bet he used nitrous oxide.

25:36.339 --> 25:38.264
That stuff will knock you out real fast.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.936
And it's undetectable in the
blood after a few minutes.

25:47.497 --> 25:48.770
Pretty easy to come by.

25:48.860 --> 25:51.868
And it would explain the valve on top.

25:52.059 --> 25:53.282
It's liquid under pressure.

25:53.392 --> 25:55.978
It would spill if it were upside down.

25:56.259 --> 25:57.713
All you need is a driver's license

25:57.763 --> 25:59.497
and a deposit for the tank.

25:59.647 --> 26:02.695
If this guy bought nitrous
from a local distributor,

26:02.736 --> 26:03.057
there's definitely a record.

26:03.057 --> 26:05.059
Check it out.

26:07.192 --> 26:08.014
Come on, Tina.

26:08.115 --> 26:09.991
Like, I'm the only one
working doubles here.

26:12.861 --> 26:16.404
Oh, so it's my fault that
we have strange schedules.

26:18.892 --> 26:20.868
Great. Go out with your friends.

26:20.959 --> 26:23.407
I'm sure you'll be seeing
Robert again tonight, too, huh?

26:25.144 --> 26:26.247
You know what?

26:27.231 --> 26:28.174
It's fine.

26:28.736 --> 26:30.973
I got to go. Have a fun time.

26:32.147 --> 26:33.332
This a bad time?

26:33.844 --> 26:36.001
No. Great time.

26:36.101 --> 26:37.185
What can I do for you?

26:37.466 --> 26:38.640
What are you working on?

26:39.683 --> 26:42.734
I'm examining smoke
bombs recovered from,

26:43.817 --> 26:45.603
the victim's condo,

26:45.694 --> 26:47.811
and comparing them to smoke bombs

26:47.861 --> 26:49.838
from an arson case a
couple of weeks ago.

26:50.731 --> 26:52.377
How do you know which is which?

26:52.527 --> 26:54.163
I mean, how do you tell them apart?

26:54.916 --> 26:58.769
Well, so far, I've only opened
up one item from each case.

26:59.712 --> 27:01.909
CSIs, when we work a case,

27:02.111 --> 27:04.780
we take extensive notes at the scene,

27:04.930 --> 27:07.509
and photos of each item.

27:08.632 --> 27:13.098
And, they're very similar, I know.

27:14.061 --> 27:18.004
But, based on the construction
and the components,

27:18.847 --> 27:22.600
I'd say these two bombs
were made by the same person.

27:30.146 --> 27:32.455
So I guess this is a
slow day at the morgue.

27:32.665 --> 27:34.632
You can't really predict this job.

27:34.802 --> 27:37.662
Today it's like this,
tomorrow it's a bus accident.

27:37.853 --> 27:40.060
So I am here.

27:40.211 --> 27:41.565
- Albert.
- Yeah?

27:41.716 --> 27:44.054
Did you find the blood
sample I called you about?

27:44.104 --> 27:47.365
Female arson fatality.
COD is smoke inhalation.

27:47.516 --> 27:51.179
Partial tox came back
carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide.

27:51.389 --> 27:53.597
I need a test for lorazepam.

27:53.737 --> 27:55.383
Blood's on its way to tox.

27:56.186 --> 27:58.533
You recall any other
sexual assault victims

27:58.634 --> 28:00.510
that tested positive for lorazepam?

28:00.601 --> 28:01.439
nothing comes to mind,

28:01.439 --> 28:04.657
but I'll check my files,
confer with toxicology.

28:04.748 --> 28:05.746
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:07.683 --> 28:09.661
A slow day is a good day.

28:11.084 --> 28:12.738
These people lived on the same floor

28:12.879 --> 28:15.522
as the female arson
fatality from two weeks ago.

28:15.633 --> 28:18.791
Tox on the arson victim came
back negative for lorazepam.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.778
So maybe she wasn't the target.

28:20.940 --> 28:24.198
Ms. Sidle, is this what you
guys call a "fishing expedition"?

28:24.298 --> 28:25.661
We call this following a lead.

28:25.761 --> 28:27.930
Forgive me, but it's
not very much of a lead.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.412
What's that supposed to mean?

28:30.503 --> 28:32.964
Well, this case is even
colder than the one you're on.

28:33.055 --> 28:34.195
You'd almost be better off

28:34.296 --> 28:35.991
if you had a new rape
victim and a fresh scene.

28:36.233 --> 28:38.684
That might be true,

28:38.785 --> 28:42.659
but that is definitely not the
outcome that we're looking for.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.796
I didn't really know the girl who died.

28:54.694 --> 28:56.439
I still can't believe what happened.

28:56.541 --> 28:57.721
It's just awful.

28:57.791 --> 28:59.536
Tell me what you remember.

29:01.262 --> 29:03.531
I was alone in my
apartment saturday night.

29:03.622 --> 29:04.903
Hello. What's new, right?

29:05.463 --> 29:07.082
I was reading or something.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.864
And then, suddenly, there was
someone pounding on my door.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.215
Can you describe what he looked like?

29:21.367 --> 29:22.871
Well, he was fireman.

29:23.385 --> 29:25.090
I mean, he was wearing a mask.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.885
It all happened pretty quick.

29:28.681 --> 29:30.335
Why?

29:31.193 --> 29:35.762
We're looking for a rapist
who masquerades as a fireman.

29:36.055 --> 29:41.140
He uses smoke bombs to get his
victims to open their doors.

29:42.653 --> 29:44.207
He knocked on my door.

29:44.297 --> 29:47.868
Are you saying you think
he was going to rape me?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.352
It's possible.

29:50.057 --> 29:53.739
You know, I was pretty freaked.

29:56.050 --> 29:58.370
When he was standing
there in front of me...

30:02.092 --> 30:03.979
Just before he left,

30:04.170 --> 30:06.491
I swear, for a second,

30:06.773 --> 30:07.773
it felt like he wasn't
going to let me go.

30:15.550 --> 30:16.969
Turnouts were a dead end.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.689
And there's nothing to
track off of the smoke bombs.

30:19.809 --> 30:21.398
I've got hundreds of names of people

30:21.488 --> 30:24.157
who purchased nitrous oxide
in the last six months.

30:24.358 --> 30:26.007
What? You got to narrow that down.

30:26.197 --> 30:28.117
That is narrowed down.

30:30.007 --> 30:33.096
Okay. Our rapist is a foot fetishist.

30:33.196 --> 30:34.276
That's what gets him off.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.895
He has to see his
victim's feet somewhere.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.235
If we can figure out where,

30:38.425 --> 30:40.105
maybe we can find him.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.094
What do the victims have in common?

30:44.434 --> 30:48.273
Christina Hollis,
african american, single.

30:48.363 --> 30:50.572
lives and works at the omni.

30:50.662 --> 30:52.403
She lives on the 11th floor,

30:52.502 --> 30:56.052
so there's no real way
for a peeper to see in.

30:56.241 --> 30:59.081
And she uses the gym, but not the pool.

30:59.181 --> 31:01.161
Stephanie Daniels lives across town.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.710
Caucasian. Also single.

31:02.810 --> 31:03.980
No gym membership,

31:04.079 --> 31:06.879
but she does use the pool at
her apartment complex regularly.

31:06.979 --> 31:09.688
There's a couple of adjacent buildings.

31:09.738 --> 31:12.092
It's possible that somebody could
see into her place with a telescope,

31:12.127 --> 31:15.197
but she has shades and curtains.

31:15.237 --> 31:16.737
I kind of doubt it.

31:16.847 --> 31:19.227
So they have nothing in common.

31:19.976 --> 31:21.216
Sure, they do.

31:21.316 --> 31:22.806
They both have feet.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.686
We may have a third victim

31:24.836 --> 31:27.165
who may also be our first victim.

31:27.355 --> 31:28.574
Tara Weathers.

31:28.674 --> 31:30.984
Last month, she claimed
she was drugged in a bar

31:31.134 --> 31:34.913
and woke up in her apartment
with her toes freshly painted.

31:35.004 --> 31:36.653
They did a tox on her at the time.

31:36.803 --> 31:39.183
Found lorazepam in her system.

31:43.162 --> 31:44.702
Well, she does have nice feet.

31:44.801 --> 31:47.371
And the nail polish
looks like a similar shade

31:47.471 --> 31:49.160
to Christina Hollis'.

31:49.301 --> 31:51.759
Yeah. So the pattern starts a month ago.

31:51.794 --> 31:54.219
Our guy drugs Tara Weathers in a bar,

31:54.269 --> 31:57.679
takes her to her apartment,
paints her toes, leaves.

31:57.779 --> 32:00.018
Two weeks later, he steps it up.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.338
Poses as a firefighter,

32:01.388 --> 32:03.357
places smoke bombs in
an apartment building,

32:03.457 --> 32:05.717
only things don't work out
the way that he planned.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.626
The building catches fire, and he runs.

32:08.747 --> 32:11.617
He waits a couple more
weeks, he does it again,

32:11.686 --> 32:13.567
but this time he goes all the way.

32:13.667 --> 32:15.527
Yeah. And now he's escalating.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.127
Where does he go from here?

32:22.667 --> 32:23.977
Tara Weathers?

32:24.307 --> 32:26.227
I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas police.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.777
This is Catherine Willows
from the crime lab.

32:27.827 --> 32:28.877
What do you want?

32:28.977 --> 32:31.317
Well, we're here to ask
you about the incident

32:31.387 --> 32:33.017
you reported to the police last month.

32:33.137 --> 32:34.257
The nail polish thing?

32:34.307 --> 32:35.347
Yeah, the nail polish thing.

32:35.437 --> 32:36.847
You guys said I should
consider myself lucky,

32:36.947 --> 32:38.577
that there was no real crime anyway.

32:38.767 --> 32:40.787
Well, we may have been wrong about that.

32:40.927 --> 32:43.897
I knew it, that's what I tried
to tell you the first time.

32:47.587 --> 32:50.277
The guy who drugged you
is a rapist and a murderer,

32:50.367 --> 32:52.477
and we're looking to stop
him before he does it again.

32:52.577 --> 32:53.474
Are you serious?

32:53.509 --> 32:54.379
Very.

32:54.414 --> 32:56.657
We're trying to understand
what you have in common

32:56.757 --> 32:59.367
with the other victims
that might lead us to him.

32:59.438 --> 33:00.897
Now he has a foot fetish.

33:00.988 --> 33:01.877
He's into feet.

33:01.977 --> 33:05.678
Is there any way that he
could've... seen your feet?

33:05.777 --> 33:09.887
I
- I... I don't know.

33:09.977 --> 33:11.437
Where do you buy your shoes?

33:11.527 --> 33:12.477
All over.

33:12.617 --> 33:13.735
Do you go to a gym?

33:13.770 --> 33:14.854
No, not really.

33:15.187 --> 33:15.799
Pool?

33:15.835 --> 33:17.807
No, never. I burn easily.

33:18.237 --> 33:20.667
I'm a legal secretary,
I don't get out much.

33:20.777 --> 33:22.457
My work starts early and it goes late.

33:22.618 --> 33:23.887
The firm is so conservative,

33:23.947 --> 33:25.867
we're not even allowed
to wear open-toed shoes.

33:27.327 --> 33:28.882
I notice that you do yoga.

33:29.589 --> 33:30.208
Yeah.

33:30.527 --> 33:31.396
Where?

33:31.431 --> 33:32.686
Out on the balcony.

33:32.687 --> 33:34.557
It's practically the
only fresh air I get.

33:48.898 --> 33:51.607
Anybody in those apartments has
a clear view of her bare feet.

33:52.408 --> 33:54.607
So how'd you get the warrant?

33:55.938 --> 33:58.648
The tenant's name was on
the nitrous oxide list.

33:59.488 --> 34:00.297
Las Vegas police.

34:00.397 --> 34:02.178
Open up, we have a warrant.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.708
Open up, police.

34:05.178 --> 34:05.977
Open it.

34:09.237 --> 34:09.987
Let's go.

34:10.228 --> 34:12.617
No, no, no, you're
not going in there, no.

34:12.706 --> 34:13.858
Can you please take this in,

34:13.958 --> 34:14.987
it's a flashlight cam.

34:15.038 --> 34:16.697
It'll record anything you point it at.

34:17.286 --> 34:18.507
Thanks.

34:18.786 --> 34:19.678
All clear.

34:20.608 --> 34:21.648
Thanks.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.507
Ok, get in.

34:23.947 --> 34:24.638
Zoom.

34:25.808 --> 34:26.516
Zoom.

34:38.248 --> 34:40.217
Perfect view of Tara's balcony.

34:50.318 --> 34:52.206
Yoga flyers from all over town.

34:56.558 --> 34:58.578
Guy's got everything
he needs for a pedicure.

35:15.018 --> 35:15.978
Hey, check this out.

35:18.498 --> 35:19.808
God bless the internet.

36:06.580 --> 36:08.030
Fireman's air tank case.

36:13.710 --> 36:14.729
Where's the tank?

36:23.477 --> 36:24.858
Yeah, this is Brass.

36:24.957 --> 36:27.777
I want to put a broadcast
out on Richard McQueen.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.537
That's
m-c-q-u-e-e-n.

36:33.347 --> 36:34.616
Candle wax.

37:29.018 --> 37:30.328
Stay down!

37:30.448 --> 37:31.637
Las Vegas PD!

37:31.828 --> 37:33.627
Las Vegas PD, break it up!

37:33.777 --> 37:34.756
Break it up!

37:34.947 --> 37:35.704
What the hell's going on here?

37:35.739 --> 37:36.855
Smoke bombs.

37:36.856 --> 37:39.416
We caught this creep sneaking
away. My guys tried to stop him.

37:40.046 --> 37:42.024
She wouldn't let me touch her feet.

37:42.060 --> 37:42.833
Get him out of here.

37:43.045 --> 37:44.355
You should see what he did?

38:20.695 --> 38:22.706
Women are four times
more likely than men

38:22.796 --> 38:25.137
to be the victims of
a sex-related murder.

38:25.237 --> 38:28.607
And men are ten times more likely
than women to be the murderer.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.299
It's just the way it is.

38:50.005 --> 38:50.986
Is that your daughter?

38:51.976 --> 38:54.687
Oh, yeah, these are old pictures.

38:54.838 --> 38:56.328
She's a teenager now.

38:56.888 --> 38:58.248
With all the things you see on this job,

38:58.298 --> 38:59.429
do you ever worry about her?

38:59.989 --> 39:01.209
Are you kidding?

39:01.490 --> 39:03.740
I keep a vial of her
blood in my freezer.

39:04.071 --> 39:07.451
Like as a dna sample in case
you need to identify her?

39:09.512 --> 39:10.693
Well...

39:12.473 --> 39:15.694
one thing you learn doing this job

39:15.985 --> 39:19.816
is that bad things happen to
people who never expect it...

39:20.376 --> 39:21.266
every day.

39:31.710 --> 39:33.210
Yeah, we got a confession.

39:33.731 --> 39:37.052
He didn't choose women's
feet, women's feet chose him.

39:37.352 --> 39:40.554
He lit candles, he played music,
he thought he was on a date.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.984
But did he explain,
you know, why he did it?

39:43.035 --> 39:44.305
Oh, yeah. Oh, sure.

39:44.494 --> 39:46.156
His mother was a hooker,

39:46.246 --> 39:48.687
she put him under the bed
when she did her business,

39:48.836 --> 39:51.258
her feet dangled over
the edge of the bed.

39:51.407 --> 39:54.028
He watched her feet, they were perfect.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.899
You know, I don't know if it's true.

39:56.049 --> 39:57.639
What about the fireman thing?

39:58.990 --> 39:59.979
I don't know,

39:59.979 --> 40:02.002
I guess he wanted to be
a fireman when he grew up.

40:02.092 --> 40:02.993
Didn't you?

40:04.265 --> 40:06.788
Look, juries love explanations,
they want it nice and neat.

40:06.888 --> 40:09.562
They don't want to know
we live in a random world,

40:09.753 --> 40:12.747
they want meaning. It's that simple.

40:13.408 --> 40:15.140
So how do you cope
with a day like today?

40:15.190 --> 40:16.282
What do you do?

40:18.535 --> 40:19.977
What do you want me to
tell you, that I go home,

40:20.067 --> 40:21.859
I get drunk, I go to a bar,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.293
I stay out all night, I don't sleep...?

40:26.126 --> 40:28.419
That's not the truth.
You know what happens?

40:28.559 --> 40:30.912
I take care of myself,
I sleep very well.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.454
How well did you sleep after you learned

40:32.564 --> 40:34.898
you killed that fellow officer
in that shootout last year?

40:43.510 --> 40:45.903
is this... is that... is
this what this is about?

40:46.003 --> 40:47.215
Who've you been talking to?

40:47.926 --> 40:49.468
What, you come here with your camera

40:49.568 --> 40:51.341
and you roll a little film and...

40:51.451 --> 40:53.414
what, you think you know
what it's like to be a cop?

40:53.524 --> 40:54.406
You?

40:56.398 --> 40:58.290
You're all done. You're
all done with this.

40:59.042 --> 41:00.113
Get out of here.

41:04.099 --> 41:05.971
The truth is if there
isn't any evidence,

41:06.071 --> 41:07.474
we have nowhere to go.

41:07.664 --> 41:09.116
So you feel you did the best you could?

41:09.775 --> 41:10.999
Yes, I do.

41:11.469 --> 41:12.501
Do you think forensic shows

41:12.551 --> 41:14.614
are just teaching the criminals
how to get away with crimes?

41:16.441 --> 41:17.989
Everyone learns from science.

41:18.884 --> 41:21.463
It all depends on how
you use the knowledge.

41:26.891 --> 41:29.150
