01:48.450 --> 01:50.119
Uh, howdy, pilgrim.

01:55.757 --> 01:57.059
Thought you were dead.

01:57.093 --> 01:59.929
Not hardly.

01:59.962 --> 02:02.464
Hey, hey.
Is that kid cheating?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.967
- I bet he palmed it.
- Stand up, boy.

02:05.001 --> 02:08.570
There's a kid in the saloon skinning
everybody at the poker table.

02:08.603 --> 02:11.506
Get back here.

02:11.539 --> 02:12.774
I'm talking to you.

02:25.221 --> 02:26.621
Hey, kid.

02:29.792 --> 02:30.960
You palmed that card.

02:33.495 --> 02:34.763
That's a sorry excuse

02:34.797 --> 02:36.198
for losing to a kid.

02:36.232 --> 02:37.666
Own up.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.502
I'm tired of talking.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.570
Look, mister,
if you don't know how to play,

02:42.604 --> 02:44.106
don't put up the money.

02:44.140 --> 02:47.575
If you don't draw first, I will.

03:06.661 --> 03:08.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:10.099 --> 03:11.901
Easy now.

03:30.886 --> 03:32.188
How old are you, kid?

03:33.555 --> 03:34.790
Seventeen.

03:36.125 --> 03:37.625
Seventeen.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.905
Did you palm that card?

03:54.877 --> 03:57.813
I don't think I'm gonna
let you boys kill a kid today.

03:58.948 --> 04:00.850
Who the hell are you?

04:38.120 --> 04:39.587
Is there a doc?

04:39.621 --> 04:42.158
Yeah. Grab your horse.

04:42.191 --> 04:44.226
Doc's about a quarter mile away.

05:04.413 --> 05:06.648
That bullet.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.751
Well, you're pretty lucky.

05:09.785 --> 05:14.323
Two more inches and that bullet would
have ripped through your spleen,

05:14.356 --> 05:17.793
your stomach, and your ribcage.

05:17.827 --> 05:22.764
But you just got a flesh wound.

05:22.798 --> 05:24.732
Oh, my God.

05:24.766 --> 05:28.037
It feels a lot more than
just a flesh wound.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.774
What kind of doctor are you?

05:34.076 --> 05:37.279
I'm a practitioner of dentistry.

05:39.448 --> 05:45.421
But I was a surgeon...
in the 5th Texas Infantry

05:45.454 --> 05:47.755
during the War of
Northern Aggression.

05:50.758 --> 05:53.028
I saw the amputations pile up.

05:53.062 --> 05:55.730
Chancellorsville, Gettysburg...

05:58.167 --> 06:00.970
and a dozen battles thereafter.

06:01.003 --> 06:02.238
Here, drink some of that.

06:07.376 --> 06:08.643
Yeah.

06:10.212 --> 06:15.050
I, uh, heard you say
you saved that kid's life.

06:16.352 --> 06:18.120
I'm not sure what he was up to,

06:18.154 --> 06:22.992
but nothing but moonshine
and trouble in that saloon.

06:23.025 --> 06:26.728
And I don't think that he is man
enough for either one of 'em.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.298
Yeah.

06:29.331 --> 06:31.233
Yeah, you know how kids are.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.136
They're always getting
into trouble.

06:34.170 --> 06:38.841
Yeah.
Judging by the scars on you,

06:38.874 --> 06:42.845
seems to me you might have been
the same kind of kid yourself.

06:42.878 --> 06:46.916
He's gonna have more problems
with the sheriff.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.350
Now, he saved the kid,

06:48.384 --> 06:51.787
but he shot three people,
including Ben Casey.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.688
He shot Ben Casey?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.292
Sure enough.

06:56.325 --> 06:57.927
Shot him right in the chest.

06:59.161 --> 07:01.063
Ben Casey.

07:02.431 --> 07:05.801
Well, he and that crowd
he hung around with,

07:05.834 --> 07:07.102
they were no good anyway.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.839
About time
somebody brought 'em down.

07:12.174 --> 07:14.276
Ain't nothing wrong
with taking the law

07:14.310 --> 07:16.879
in your own hands
if they're deserving.

07:18.247 --> 07:20.950
I ain't never seen
anybody faster.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.385
But that sheriff's
gonna look for him.

07:23.419 --> 07:26.889
One of the boys he shot
was kin to the sheriff.

07:28.090 --> 07:31.126
Well, you know, Lindstrom,

07:31.160 --> 07:35.231
the sheriff and I go way back
to the war of secession.

07:35.264 --> 07:37.233
We were in
Hood's Brigade together.

07:37.266 --> 07:40.202
So, I'll make it right with him
when he gets back.

07:40.236 --> 07:41.337
Don't you worry.

07:43.138 --> 07:46.008
I appreciate that.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.943
I don't want any...
I don't want any trouble.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.447
I'm just curious.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.484
What exactly were you doing
passing through town?

07:59.822 --> 08:03.392
I was just going to see
some old friends. Figured...

08:04.860 --> 08:08.564
Yeah, well, if you
keep up these gun fights,

08:08.597 --> 08:13.469
you won't be doing any visiting or
jawing with old friends, that's for sure.

08:13.502 --> 08:18.274
Accept my apologies,
but this may hurt.

08:20.976 --> 08:23.112
Oh, God!

08:28.317 --> 08:31.287
I didn't think
he'd be out for so long.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.554
Well, maybe he's just resting.

08:33.589 --> 08:37.159
Looking at all those scars,
there's a long history on that man.

08:37.192 --> 08:39.895
A lot of men
pass through this town.

08:39.928 --> 08:41.196
A lot of stories.

08:41.230 --> 08:44.566
Some true,
some worse than others.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.502
Well, I don't know
how many more stories

08:46.535 --> 08:49.038
Kansas is gonna have
if he keeps this up.

08:50.873 --> 08:52.841
Hoo... hooch is wearing off.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.446
You got some good stuff, Doc.

08:57.479 --> 08:58.947
I might have to try that.

08:58.981 --> 09:01.283
Medicinal purposes only, Lind.

09:09.491 --> 09:12.461
Where's my gun?
What did you do with my gun?

09:12.494 --> 09:13.562
Right there, right there,
right there.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.030
I-I took the liberty

09:15.064 --> 09:18.400
of cleaning it
and oiling it for you.

09:18.434 --> 09:23.539
You never know how patients
are gonna react after surgery.

09:23.572 --> 09:26.542
I'm the only doctor
within a 100 miles of here,

09:26.575 --> 09:30.312
and I don't recommend
doing surgery on yourself.

09:30.346 --> 09:33.482
I tried that once.
It didn't work out so well, I tell you.

09:33.515 --> 09:38.554
Anyway, my apologies,
my apologies. I...

09:38.587 --> 09:42.358
My pa says the only thing more important
than a man's gun is his humility.

09:42.391 --> 09:46.395
Your pa's a smart man.
You should learn to follow him.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.376
- What do I owe you, Doc?
- Owe me?

10:01.210 --> 10:03.011
You don't owe me.

10:03.045 --> 10:05.414
You took out Ben Casey
and his sons.

10:05.447 --> 10:07.516
If anything, I owe you.

10:11.420 --> 10:15.657
Listen, I don't think
you should leave

10:15.691 --> 10:17.126
until your head clears.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.363
But, ah, hell, you're not gonna
heed me anyway, are you?

10:24.533 --> 10:25.601
Mister?

10:39.114 --> 10:42.017
If you get a moment, I'd just
like to run something by you.

10:45.554 --> 10:47.189
Feeling okay?

10:47.222 --> 10:49.091
Look, look, I don't...
I don't mean to bother you,

10:49.124 --> 10:51.059
but just when-when...
when you're done,

10:51.093 --> 10:54.163
I wanted to talk to you
about something of mine.

10:54.196 --> 10:55.130
What do you want, kid?

10:55.164 --> 10:58.333
Uh, well, actually,
I got this book here.

10:58.367 --> 11:01.103
I think you might know it.
I mean, it's not... it's...

11:01.136 --> 11:02.971
it's not exactly my...
my kind of...

11:03.005 --> 11:05.507
- Oh, God.
- Kinda... kinda story,

11:05.541 --> 11:08.110
uh, but that's you there.

11:08.143 --> 11:10.946
- Help me on this horse.
- Okay.

11:16.251 --> 11:18.520
You get up there all right?
Feels okay on there?

11:21.223 --> 11:24.460
- So-so I wanted to talk to you for a moment...
- I'll see you around, kid.

11:24.493 --> 11:28.096
Hey, hey.
Did you hear what I said?

11:28.130 --> 11:30.299
Sir, I just need
a second of your time.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.436
But... it's my Pa, he's got...

11:34.470 --> 11:36.238
I know his type.

11:36.271 --> 11:39.041
He's searching for something,
but he don't know what.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.311
And he won't stop
till he finds it.

11:42.344 --> 11:46.348
Lindstrom, the next time
you bring me a patient,

11:46.381 --> 11:49.518
it'd be really nice if their
teeth needed fixing, too.

11:50.619 --> 11:52.020
Sure, Doc.

12:07.202 --> 12:08.470
Hey, mister.

12:10.672 --> 12:13.509
Mister, I don't care
sour grapes about you, but...

12:15.410 --> 12:17.346
Look, I'm broke
and I'm foot sore,

12:17.379 --> 12:18.580
and so you got to listen.

12:25.187 --> 12:26.688
Oh, God.

12:33.863 --> 12:36.799
Look, we-we got us a ranch
down in Bell's Meadow,

12:36.833 --> 12:38.667
west of Texas,
off in the foothills,

12:38.700 --> 12:42.204
and my Ma's been getting letters
from Canon City prison.

12:42.872 --> 12:44.506
Thorn Larson.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.810
Pa got real mad
and burned 'em up.

12:47.844 --> 12:50.212
I've never seen him that mad.

12:50.245 --> 12:52.548
Ma said he used to bother her
before she got married

12:52.581 --> 12:57.753
and Pa said you're the only one that can
maybe stop Larson when his time is up.

12:57.787 --> 13:02.157
But I just heard how Larson busted free
at Canon City, so we gotta warn Pa.

13:05.193 --> 13:07.229
What's your name?

13:07.262 --> 13:10.098
Cassidy. Billy Cassidy.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.468
What's your ma's name?

13:13.502 --> 13:16.405
Carol.
And my pa's name is Sam.

13:17.406 --> 13:19.675
You have any other kin?

13:19.708 --> 13:22.779
Well, my pa,
he had a brother, Jack.

13:22.812 --> 13:24.646
Seems he-he went off
to fight with Grant.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.248
Got killed.

13:26.281 --> 13:28.617
So there's no Cassidy's
left except my pa.

13:29.585 --> 13:31.153
And-and my ma she's got a...

13:31.186 --> 13:33.655
she got friend over from...
from Texas, Leslie Allen,

13:33.689 --> 13:35.792
shoots better than I do, but...

13:35.825 --> 13:37.659
Look, are you gonna
help us or not?

13:38.861 --> 13:42.197
Honest truth. You cheat?

13:42.230 --> 13:44.733
Well, yeah.
But he cheated first, so I just...

13:44.766 --> 13:49.504
You damn cheat. God.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.341
Don't-don't tell my Pa.
He'd whoop me for sure.

13:54.176 --> 13:55.912
So you gonna help us or not?

13:55.945 --> 13:57.613
How far?

13:58.915 --> 14:00.482
Three days.

14:00.515 --> 14:02.484
Quit smiling, kid.

14:24.539 --> 14:27.309
Leslie, you're my best friend,
but if I didn't know better

14:27.342 --> 14:28.945
I'd think you were a boy.

14:28.978 --> 14:32.514
The way you hold that gun.

14:32.547 --> 14:34.316
Like the love of her life.

14:34.349 --> 14:35.717
How are you supposed to
find a husband

14:35.751 --> 14:37.519
if you can outshoot
and outride them all?

14:37.552 --> 14:39.221
Come on, now. Leave her be.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.424
One of us has to meet these men
on their own terms.

14:42.457 --> 14:46.428
Lord knows you and I just
run the house for our masters.

14:46.461 --> 14:49.899
After I married Sam,
and my father died

14:49.932 --> 14:51.533
my mother moved to Texas.

14:51.566 --> 14:54.403
And Leslie's mother
sent her along

14:54.436 --> 14:56.271
to get away from
some secret admirer.

14:56.839 --> 14:58.774
A long time ago.

14:58.808 --> 15:00.509
How old were you, 15?

15:00.542 --> 15:02.577
Sixteen.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.379
Sixteen.

15:04.413 --> 15:06.481
It changed her, though.

15:06.515 --> 15:08.316
Do you even own a dress?

15:09.651 --> 15:11.888
Now what happened
to the secret admirer

15:11.921 --> 15:13.422
she was dragged away from?

15:13.455 --> 15:15.424
She will not tell.

15:34.376 --> 15:35.377
Whoa, boys.

15:36.545 --> 15:38.246
This is my property.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.916
Sam Cassidy?

15:39.949 --> 15:41.283
That's me.

15:47.756 --> 15:49.324
Oh, my God.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.726
Ladies, get to the cellar now.

15:50.759 --> 15:52.829
Now! Go! Get!

15:59.869 --> 16:01.369
Get outside!

16:02.637 --> 16:03.906
Get out!

16:19.922 --> 16:21.023
No.

16:46.648 --> 16:47.784
Thorn.

16:52.989 --> 16:54.489
Where's my husband?

16:55.490 --> 16:56.926
You're looking at him.

16:59.461 --> 17:03.498
Looks like we're gonna have to
extract that tooth, Mr. Veal.

17:03.532 --> 17:06.002
Now, if you could just say "ah".

17:06.035 --> 17:07.702
Now this ain't gonna
hurt too much.

17:07.736 --> 17:10.940
I applied enough
numbing agent to your gums.

17:10.973 --> 17:13.708
You wouldn't feel a bullet
going through your jaw.

17:15.477 --> 17:16.678
Where is he?

17:16.711 --> 17:18.781
Excuse me?

17:18.815 --> 17:20.983
You talk to
a doctor like that?

17:21.017 --> 17:24.954
You know, you may be in need
of medical attention one day.

17:24.987 --> 17:29.058
I ain't got time for your games.
Where is he?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.860
Where is who?

17:30.893 --> 17:32.995
Kansas Red.

17:33.029 --> 17:35.597
I know you treated the man
who killed my brother.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.731
Now, where is he?

17:36.765 --> 17:39.802
I don't know no Kansas Red.

17:40.837 --> 17:42.504
You are lying, Doc.

17:42.537 --> 17:43.973
And I'll shoot you.

17:45.842 --> 17:48.978
Now, why don't you point
that sidearm another direction,

17:49.011 --> 17:52.514
then maybe we can sit down
and talk calmly about this.

17:52.547 --> 17:54.917
I'm losing time, Doc,
and so are you.

17:54.951 --> 17:56.052
Now, where'd he go?

17:56.085 --> 17:59.487
I don't know where he went.

17:59.521 --> 18:02.591
I will shoot you
in your backside.

18:02.624 --> 18:06.062
Why are you protecting him?
He ain't no kin of yours.

18:06.095 --> 18:11.033
I'm not protecting anybody.
Now you need to leave my office.

18:11.067 --> 18:14.136
I ain't leaving
until you tell me where he is.

18:14.170 --> 18:16.839
And I sincerely hope I don't
have to shoot you in the leg

18:16.873 --> 18:19.108
and get the truth
to leak out of you.

18:39.896 --> 18:41.596
You really think
there's a posse coming?

18:41.630 --> 18:42.832
I don't see anybody.

18:42.865 --> 18:45.533
But we need to make tracks,
just in case.

18:48.637 --> 18:50.072
Women gonna be trouble?

18:50.106 --> 18:51.606
Men are already
fighting over 'em.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.774
Well, they can wait.

18:54.010 --> 18:56.145
I want Ms. Cassidy
to settle down.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.847
And she's my woman, you know.

18:57.880 --> 19:01.716
Yeah. I like the young one.

19:02.919 --> 19:05.687
Ms. Cassidy sees or hears
one bad act,

19:05.720 --> 19:07.056
I'll kill you.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.233
This frightens me.

19:53.903 --> 19:56.705
Don't be scared.
You're with me.

19:59.308 --> 20:00.508
You're different.

20:03.045 --> 20:08.483
All those years in prison,
and all because of Jack Cassidy.

20:09.986 --> 20:11.787
I'm gonna find him
one of these days,

20:11.821 --> 20:15.623
and I'm gonna make him pay
for ruining my life.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.560
Jack died in the war.

20:21.030 --> 20:22.264
Damn.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.168
All these years
I've been waiting.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.038
And he cheated me.

20:51.827 --> 20:54.096
Say a damn word,
I'll kill you.

20:54.130 --> 20:56.832
- Understand?
- Mm-hmm.

20:56.866 --> 20:59.001
Alright. So come with me.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.691
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!

21:23.725 --> 21:25.693
- You shut your mouth.
- No!

21:28.831 --> 21:31.033
You just shut your mouth.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.975
Oh, yeah.

21:45.948 --> 21:47.582
Let me go!

22:16.045 --> 22:17.079
Move.

22:24.220 --> 22:26.188
Leslie's gonna die out there.

22:29.792 --> 22:32.027
She's my best friend.

22:32.061 --> 22:34.363
Well, you didn't care
when she ran off to Texas.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.730
Why do you care now?

22:38.801 --> 22:41.003
Charlie will find her.
She's on foot.

22:42.238 --> 22:44.006
We'll get out of these woods
before long,

22:44.039 --> 22:46.809
and we'll drop them off
at a trading post or something.

22:46.842 --> 22:48.743
Where are you taking her?

22:48.777 --> 22:53.149
- Ah-ah, leave her be.
- Wait, no! Wait!

22:53.182 --> 22:55.750
I don't want you women
talking to each other anyway.

22:57.086 --> 22:59.021
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

23:33.489 --> 23:35.124
Well, I'll be.

23:47.069 --> 23:49.805
Billy. Where you been?

23:49.838 --> 23:51.407
Where's Pa?

23:51.440 --> 23:55.511
Well... sorry to tell you,

23:55.544 --> 23:59.714
but he's buried up
on the hill with his men.

24:01.517 --> 24:03.919
Folks has been taking turns

24:03.953 --> 24:07.356
looking after the place
till y'all got back.

24:09.425 --> 24:11.060
Wh... where's Ma?

24:13.429 --> 24:17.099
Well... she carried off...

24:18.534 --> 24:23.072
along with Leslie Allen
and Mrs. Walker.

24:24.340 --> 24:27.176
They say outlaws took 'em.

24:27.209 --> 24:29.478
Fella by the name
of Thorn Larson.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.448
Whole bunch busted out
of Canon City.

24:32.481 --> 24:35.884
Sly Walker, you know,
he's in town at the doc's.

24:35.918 --> 24:37.519
Shot up somethin' awful.

24:39.088 --> 24:40.256
Even if he make it,

24:40.289 --> 24:41.991
he ain't gonna
ever be the same.

24:43.892 --> 24:46.462
Mr. Finnegan,
this is Kansas Red.

24:48.063 --> 24:49.398
Mr. Kansas.

24:53.435 --> 24:57.006
The name Finnegan.
Glad to know you.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.942
I prospected up there.
I know that land.

25:00.876 --> 25:02.311
I can track, too.

25:03.412 --> 25:04.446
Want me with you?

25:04.480 --> 25:06.115
Can you keep up?

25:07.182 --> 25:09.018
There ain't no doubt.

25:39.148 --> 25:41.583
I'm gonna search
the lower elevation.

25:41.617 --> 25:44.119
Make camp where I tie my horse.

27:16.311 --> 27:17.479
Who's there?

27:23.685 --> 27:24.686
Come on.

27:27.523 --> 27:28.957
Come on.

27:32.227 --> 27:33.395
What do I do?

27:43.605 --> 27:45.340
Come on out.

27:48.076 --> 27:49.178
Come on out!

27:54.283 --> 27:55.350
Come out now.

27:59.288 --> 28:01.023
Oh, miss.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.195
- It's okay. Hey, hey.
- No, no.

28:06.228 --> 28:07.663
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:09.665 --> 28:11.700
Miss, you all right?

28:11.733 --> 28:12.734
Hey, hey, look at me.

28:12.768 --> 28:14.102
Come on now.

28:15.471 --> 28:16.772
Hey, come on.

28:16.806 --> 28:18.574
It's okay, hey.

28:19.441 --> 28:20.742
I ain't gonna hurt you.

28:22.211 --> 28:23.479
You're cold. Come on.

28:25.247 --> 28:28.517
Come on. You can trust me.

28:28.550 --> 28:29.618
Okay.

28:34.623 --> 28:38.060
Okay. Okay, I got you.
I got you. I got you.

28:43.499 --> 28:45.067
Okay, okay.

28:46.268 --> 28:47.503
I'll get you help.

28:48.437 --> 28:49.605
I'll get you help.

28:59.648 --> 29:00.682
Billy.

29:01.416 --> 29:02.651
Ms. Leslie!

29:06.355 --> 29:08.257
Get her down now.

29:08.290 --> 29:11.126
Hold on.
Get her by the fire.

29:12.761 --> 29:15.097
Easy.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.632
- You got her?
- I got her.

29:19.802 --> 29:21.503
Billy, we got coffee on?

29:23.739 --> 29:25.207
Have a seat.

29:27.509 --> 29:29.077
It'll be alright.

29:37.252 --> 29:38.654
We didn't...

29:40.656 --> 29:41.791
My mother...

29:43.425 --> 29:45.360
Your mother's okay.

29:46.395 --> 29:47.864
She's okay.

29:47.897 --> 29:50.332
And so is Mrs. Walker.

29:52.501 --> 29:53.836
What about Sam?

29:54.536 --> 29:55.771
He's dead.

29:57.606 --> 29:59.608
All gone, except Walker.

30:00.742 --> 30:02.277
He's gonna be crippled.

30:03.579 --> 30:04.814
Here, Billy.

30:06.214 --> 30:07.282
Give her that.

30:07.316 --> 30:10.319
Uh, Ms. Leslie,
this is Kansas Red.

30:21.831 --> 30:25.100
Have I... do I know you
from somewhere?

30:26.836 --> 30:28.403
Not likely.

30:29.806 --> 30:32.107
You have any idea
where they went?

30:33.542 --> 30:36.813
West, somewhere west,
over the ridge.

30:36.846 --> 30:39.514
You say west over the ridge?

30:39.548 --> 30:42.584
You hear 'em talk about
anywhere in particular?

30:43.685 --> 30:46.355
Mule-Mule Creek.

30:46.388 --> 30:50.492
Mule Creek? That's...
that's an old trading post.

30:50.525 --> 30:52.628
It's been abandoned years now.

30:53.629 --> 30:54.797
Alright, Billy,

30:54.831 --> 30:56.698
you take her back.

30:56.732 --> 31:00.369
No, I am staying here.
I have earned my place.

31:01.703 --> 31:03.238
And Carol is my friend.

31:04.206 --> 31:06.541
What is it with you, huh?

31:06.575 --> 31:07.810
You have a death wish?

31:07.844 --> 31:10.646
She could just ride
the pack horse.

31:10.679 --> 31:14.549
And I'm not goin' back either, so we'll
just shorten stirrups on the saddle.

31:16.284 --> 31:17.452
You goin' back.

31:28.664 --> 31:31.266
He looks so familiar to me.

31:31.299 --> 31:34.369
You've probably seen his face
on them dime novels.

31:35.637 --> 31:36.939
Pa said he's the only one

31:36.973 --> 31:38.340
who could stop Larson.

31:38.373 --> 31:41.576
No one can get Larson.

31:41.610 --> 31:44.680
He's the most vicious man
that I've ever seen.

31:48.583 --> 31:52.621
Let's just establish one thing
right now. I'm in charge.

31:52.654 --> 31:55.257
Billy, take her back.

31:55.290 --> 31:58.226
I am not going anywhere.

31:58.260 --> 32:01.296
You're not. Good luck.

32:19.414 --> 32:20.950
Larson's camp?

32:20.983 --> 32:23.585
Reckon they've been gone
since sometime this morning.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.990
Yeah, all the coals are out.

32:46.608 --> 32:47.844
Marianne's.

32:54.516 --> 32:55.985
All right,
look for hoof prints.

32:56.018 --> 32:57.787
See what direction
they were headed.

32:57.820 --> 32:59.856
They can't be that far
ahead of us.

33:15.337 --> 33:17.073
No. It's Marianne.

33:17.106 --> 33:19.008
- Don't. No.
- No. No.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.442
There ain't nothing
down here for you to see.

33:20.475 --> 33:23.045
No, no, no, no.

33:30.452 --> 33:36.926
Blessed are the pure
in heart for they shall see God.

33:36.959 --> 33:39.594
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

33:42.564 --> 33:43.732
No.

33:52.774 --> 33:54.576
Everybody find something
to get behind.

33:56.478 --> 33:57.947
I can't see anything.

34:00.983 --> 34:04.854
Leslie, stay down.
Billy, where are you?

34:08.090 --> 34:09.792
Finnegan, to your right!

34:22.704 --> 34:24.472
Finnegan, coming your way.

34:27.509 --> 34:29.411
Get ready. Shoot!

34:44.559 --> 34:46.393
Hey, stop firing.

34:50.833 --> 34:55.437
Let's get back. Regroup.
Get back, Billy.

34:56.072 --> 34:57.505
Is everyone okay?

34:59.041 --> 35:00.408
Yeah.

35:03.645 --> 35:05.647
Finnegan,
can you get the horses?

35:05.680 --> 35:07.449
We got to stay on their trail.

35:29.972 --> 35:31.040
Whoa.

35:33.943 --> 35:35.577
God dang it.

35:46.989 --> 35:48.124
Finnegan.

36:07.910 --> 36:09.211
You know him?

36:09.245 --> 36:12.747
I know him.
It's the Grossman brothers.

36:14.616 --> 36:16.751
Tom here had a wife
and two kids.

36:22.058 --> 36:23.658
Let's check this.

37:09.905 --> 37:11.974
We're just gonna
stay here tonight.

37:25.921 --> 37:27.189
Wow.

37:36.631 --> 37:38.300
Oh, my God.

37:39.268 --> 37:40.302
Oh.

37:42.071 --> 37:43.205
Oh, my God.

37:44.606 --> 37:46.208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

37:46.242 --> 37:48.844
- What's your name?
- Mavery.

37:48.878 --> 37:52.580
My name is Leslie.
Are you here alone?

37:52.614 --> 37:54.050
- Uh-huh.
- You are?

37:56.852 --> 37:59.055
Oh, my God. Come here.

37:59.088 --> 38:01.157
Come here. Are you okay?

38:04.927 --> 38:07.096
Oh, it's okay.

38:07.129 --> 38:08.663
I got you.

38:10.366 --> 38:14.070
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

38:16.806 --> 38:19.875
Mavery, Birdie!

38:19.909 --> 38:22.111
It's so good to see y'all.
How you doing?

38:22.144 --> 38:24.980
Hi, bud. Hi.

38:26.348 --> 38:30.853
You guys.
Okay, there you go.

38:30.886 --> 38:32.988
Ain't you a sight for sore eyes?

38:33.956 --> 38:35.891
You know where your ma is?

38:38.427 --> 38:40.096
Well, that settles that.

38:40.129 --> 38:42.064
You stay here with the kids

38:42.098 --> 38:44.834
until the stagecoach comes.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.303
No, no.
I'm going to find my friend.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.706
Don't worry about
it, Ms. Leslie.

38:51.739 --> 38:53.775
I'll stay here
with the children.

38:53.809 --> 38:55.878
A couple more days
the stage will come through.

38:55.911 --> 38:58.347
Now, if memory serves,
I could draw you a map

38:58.380 --> 38:59.747
of where they might be going.

38:59.782 --> 39:01.383
The direction they were going,

39:01.417 --> 39:05.921
I figured they might be heading
toward a place called Chance.

39:05.955 --> 39:10.826
Now, it's kind of
an outlaw hideout. Ain't no law.

39:10.860 --> 39:12.361
Ain't really much
of a town either.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.163
They might get there
to rest up a couple days,

39:14.196 --> 39:17.199
- and find a stage or a bank.
- Mm, yeah, okay.

39:17.233 --> 39:19.068
- See you.
- Thank you.

39:19.101 --> 39:21.769
Right now these children
need to get some shuteye.

39:21.804 --> 39:22.838
Mm.

39:37.086 --> 39:39.889
Say a damn word, I'll kill you.

39:47.897 --> 39:49.798
No.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.837
No. No.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.743
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- No.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.012
Hey.

40:04.346 --> 40:07.049
It's just me. Are you okay?

40:07.082 --> 40:09.985
It's-it's just a terrible dream.

40:10.019 --> 40:12.221
I have them a lot.

40:12.254 --> 40:15.791
Well, I'm sure they'll stop
once we find your friend.

40:15.824 --> 40:18.460
No, they won't.

40:22.965 --> 40:24.266
No.

40:27.536 --> 40:30.705
They won't stop until
I tell somebody about them.

40:34.410 --> 40:35.710
Please?

40:39.281 --> 40:42.717
I love Carol like a sister.

40:46.088 --> 40:49.425
But... when we were in Kansas,

40:49.458 --> 40:52.995
her mother was determined
to get her to marry Sam.

40:53.896 --> 40:55.864
He had a-a job.

40:55.898 --> 40:59.902
He did well for himself in town.
His father was a preacher.

41:01.170 --> 41:04.373
But Carol didn't care for Sam.

41:05.841 --> 41:10.112
And I-I was a lot younger.

41:11.547 --> 41:13.482
All of 16.

41:15.951 --> 41:18.020
Fully grown.

41:20.422 --> 41:22.958
And crazy in love with Sam.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.363
And he felt
the same way about me.

41:27.396 --> 41:31.133
And then, all of a sudden,

41:31.166 --> 41:33.869
he was running off,
marrying Carol.

41:36.338 --> 41:38.073
She was so beautiful.

41:38.107 --> 41:40.843
She could have had
anyone she wanted.

41:40.876 --> 41:44.280
But Sam had the money.

41:44.313 --> 41:45.281
I felt like...

41:47.249 --> 41:49.551
I felt like Sam had betrayed me.

41:53.522 --> 41:55.858
Oh.

41:55.891 --> 41:59.461
Then when I went back to the...
to the ranch to visit Carol...

42:01.964 --> 42:06.502
he acted like he didn't even recognize
me, like I was a stranger.

42:08.203 --> 42:11.273
And I didn't feel that love
like I remembered,

42:11.307 --> 42:13.475
but it still hurt.

42:14.977 --> 42:19.281
Now Sam's dead
and Carol's missing.

42:19.315 --> 42:24.420
And I feel worse
than I ever, ever could. Just...

42:27.923 --> 42:33.462
Just resentments,
and I just feel so bad.

42:33.495 --> 42:36.465
And I-I just wanna
find Carol now.

42:40.336 --> 42:42.838
The one thing
I don't understand...

42:44.473 --> 42:47.176
is where does Larson
fit into all this?

42:48.677 --> 42:53.248
All I know is that Larson

42:53.282 --> 42:55.351
has been in love with Carol,

42:55.384 --> 42:57.853
before she ever married Sam.

42:58.687 --> 43:01.090
And she'd always flirt with him.

43:02.491 --> 43:06.962
I've seen him a few times
but he scares me.

43:08.230 --> 43:12.000
And his men...
his men are just as bad.

43:12.034 --> 43:17.206
Thatch, that man, ooh,
he was a... he was a paymaster.

43:20.275 --> 43:22.144
Larson killed a lot of men.

43:23.345 --> 43:25.080
A lot of men.

43:25.114 --> 43:28.384
I think in that bank robbery.

43:32.721 --> 43:34.189
Thank you.

43:35.290 --> 43:37.092
I feel like I can...

43:37.126 --> 43:39.161
I feel like
I can go to sleep now.

43:43.465 --> 43:45.234
We're gonna find your friend.

43:48.737 --> 43:50.038
Okay.

44:29.278 --> 44:31.713
You take good care
of your sister, okay.

44:32.514 --> 44:33.515
Hm?

44:37.419 --> 44:38.954
Be careful out there.

44:46.295 --> 44:47.463
Look after 'em, now.

44:53.702 --> 44:55.337
Mr. Finnegan.

44:55.370 --> 44:56.472
Billy.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.975
Don't go doing nothin' stupid.

45:46.188 --> 45:47.623
Have we
really lost them?

45:48.657 --> 45:50.759
Well, they got
a lot of money.

45:50.793 --> 45:53.295
Bet they've been wantin'
to spend it.

45:53.328 --> 45:55.430
Wha... Around here?

45:55.464 --> 45:57.766
Right over that ridge
is Chase County.

46:00.269 --> 46:05.240
Hey, uh, why don't y'all
head back, you and Billy?

46:05.274 --> 46:07.844
I'll go out alone.
You'll get recognized.

46:07.877 --> 46:11.814
What about you? Your face
is all over those dime novels.

46:11.848 --> 46:14.449
It don't matter.

46:14.483 --> 46:16.418
What about Larson?
You don't know what he looks like.

46:16.451 --> 46:18.253
You don't even know
what Carol looks like.

46:20.155 --> 46:21.456
Where'd you get that?

46:21.490 --> 46:25.093
On the ranch.
Stay back.

46:52.688 --> 46:55.490
Mister, I'm looking for
a Thorn Larson.

46:55.524 --> 46:58.360
Him and his wife
left this morning.

46:58.393 --> 47:03.465
He had about a dozen or so
mean-looking hombres with him.

47:03.498 --> 47:07.302
Mean, mm-hmm, as hell.

47:08.437 --> 47:10.472
They didn't
cause no trouble though,

47:10.505 --> 47:14.376
they just bought up supplies
and had a drink.

47:14.409 --> 47:16.779
Two of 'em
still at the saloon.

47:20.616 --> 47:21.683
Hey, mister.

47:25.721 --> 47:29.191
If they ain't friends of yours,
I'd head on out of here.

47:36.799 --> 47:39.701
That army payroll paid us off pretty good.
Old Thorn...

47:39.735 --> 47:41.603
Keep us in this for a while.

48:08.697 --> 48:11.700
I don't believe this is the
kind of bar you want to be in.

48:35.992 --> 48:38.560
Don't you turn
your back on me.

48:56.278 --> 48:58.280
- Where's Larson?!
- Go to hell!

49:00.950 --> 49:02.785
Come on, boys. Get him inside.

49:14.864 --> 49:16.698
I'm Sam Gridley.

49:18.734 --> 49:19.869
Kansas.

49:21.070 --> 49:25.273
Kansas Red.
You the preacher man.

49:25.307 --> 49:29.011
Want to say something over
those two boys you just shot?

49:29.045 --> 49:31.379
No. Wherever they are,
they're already there.

49:32.748 --> 49:35.051
I have to find Larson.

49:35.084 --> 49:39.287
Well, all we know
is he headed west.

49:39.321 --> 49:43.558
That's open country out there.
He could have turned anywhere.

49:43.592 --> 49:45.928
There's a paymaster that was...

49:45.962 --> 49:49.698
that was robbed on another stage
road just up the ridge east of here.

49:49.731 --> 49:52.534
Well, if they've got
a lot of money,

49:52.567 --> 49:55.037
about the only other place
they could spend it around here

49:55.071 --> 49:56.839
would be Gold Hollow.

49:56.873 --> 50:00.910
There's about half a dozen
saloons up there.

50:01.944 --> 50:03.946
Heap of comings and goings.

50:03.980 --> 50:06.082
They could blend right in.

50:06.115 --> 50:09.651
It's about 40 miles due west.

50:15.490 --> 50:18.660
I know your face.
I know your face from somewhere.

50:18.693 --> 50:21.730
I can't...
I never forget a-a face.

50:21.763 --> 50:23.498
Forget a name.

50:23.532 --> 50:25.802
Where'd you say
you're from again?

50:26.869 --> 50:28.503
I didn't.

50:36.813 --> 50:38.080
Why don't you like me?

50:39.514 --> 50:40.649
What did I do?

50:40.682 --> 50:42.717
What is wrong with you?

50:43.418 --> 50:44.987
Ah, dames.

50:50.092 --> 50:51.560
Hey, get...

51:02.771 --> 51:04.706
Let's get one thing straight...

51:06.708 --> 51:08.610
I'm still in charge.

52:47.676 --> 52:48.978
Yeah, this will work.

52:50.212 --> 52:51.814
All right, listen up.

52:51.847 --> 52:54.516
You get hungry, bring the food
up to your room, okay.

52:54.549 --> 52:58.788
Don't leave the room.
I'm pretty sure Larson's around.

52:59.554 --> 53:00.823
I'm in charge.

53:00.856 --> 53:02.624
Stay in the room.

53:05.627 --> 53:06.761
I'm not...

53:22.912 --> 53:24.113
Come on.

53:29.718 --> 53:32.154
- Hide...
- He don't know nothing about it.

53:32.188 --> 53:33.823
Just keep your head down.

53:56.678 --> 53:58.881
Pal, if you're
looking for the sheriff...

54:01.817 --> 54:03.853
he ain't here.

54:03.886 --> 54:05.821
He done gone off
to Lake City.

54:06.355 --> 54:07.589
Vacation.

54:07.622 --> 54:10.159
I heard Thorn Larson's
in town.

54:11.794 --> 54:13.062
Sure as hell hope not.

54:13.095 --> 54:16.132
Well, there's his
wanted poster right there.

54:16.165 --> 54:20.036
Ho, ho, ho, ho. What is you?

54:20.069 --> 54:21.636
Some sort of bounty hunter?

54:21.669 --> 54:23.772
Kansas Red.

54:23.806 --> 54:25.640
No shit?

54:25.673 --> 54:27.343
You got one of those
telegraph machines?

54:27.376 --> 54:28.676
Sure do.

54:29.711 --> 54:31.881
But it's been down for weeks.

54:31.914 --> 54:34.582
We caught wind of Larson
escaping and that was that.

54:38.254 --> 54:41.924
He broke out
and rampaged the ranch

54:41.957 --> 54:43.893
down in Tyler, and, well,
he took three women.

54:43.926 --> 54:45.660
One's dead.

54:46.829 --> 54:48.663
One got away, and well,

54:49.331 --> 54:51.599
I hear tell,

54:51.633 --> 54:53.269
that he forced one
to marry him.

54:54.736 --> 54:56.172
Didn't hear nothin' about that.

54:56.205 --> 54:58.240
But we got a whole bunch
of people coming and going here,

54:58.274 --> 54:59.707
'cause of the mines.

55:00.742 --> 55:03.245
He'd be real hard to find.

55:03.279 --> 55:05.314
And he's gonna
have a lot of money.

55:06.782 --> 55:08.784
Knocked out the relay station,

55:08.818 --> 55:11.653
an army surplus,
and four dead troopers.

55:12.388 --> 55:14.156
Payroll?

55:14.190 --> 55:16.158
Didn't hear nothin'
about that neither.

55:16.192 --> 55:17.592
Hmm.

55:19.328 --> 55:20.595
Walk with me.

55:21.964 --> 55:24.166
He's got maybe a dozen men.

55:26.001 --> 55:27.803
And we got a loaded bank.

55:27.837 --> 55:30.672
Now, he could be anywhere.

55:30.705 --> 55:33.209
Now, this Larson,
he know you on sight?

55:34.310 --> 55:36.678
Not likely,
it was before the war.

55:37.780 --> 55:39.081
But you know him on sight?

55:39.115 --> 55:42.017
Oh, yeah.
He stands out in a crowd.

55:42.051 --> 55:43.185
He's a tall one.

55:44.752 --> 55:46.188
The more time
that we're out here,

55:46.222 --> 55:47.655
the more chances there are
that Kansas...

55:47.689 --> 55:49.792
- Billy, can you just...
- But also there...

55:49.825 --> 55:51.693
You need to relax, Billy.

55:53.728 --> 55:56.198
- What's wrong with your gun?
- My gun was taken from me.

55:56.232 --> 55:58.666
- I just don't think that...
- Oh, my God. That's Thatch.

56:01.971 --> 56:04.273
That's him.
That's Thatch.

56:11.780 --> 56:13.349
- Kansas.
- Kansas.

56:14.350 --> 56:16.285
We can't let him get away.

56:16.318 --> 56:20.422
Kansas. Kansas! Kansas!

56:20.456 --> 56:21.756
We just saw one of 'em.

56:22.791 --> 56:24.059
The one that hurt Ms. Leslie.

56:24.093 --> 56:25.327
He just rode out.

56:25.361 --> 56:27.662
What are you two doing out?

56:29.431 --> 56:33.435
Kansas, the way that man looked at Ms.
Leslie, he's coming back.

56:36.438 --> 56:40.742
I'ma stay here...
to watch out for ambushes.

56:40.775 --> 56:42.178
I'ma get up a posse.

56:47.950 --> 56:52.821
Unless you two wanna die...

56:55.324 --> 56:58.794
stay in your hotel! Okay?

57:52.014 --> 57:54.250
Miss me, girl? Do you miss me?

57:54.283 --> 57:55.784
- No! No!
- You miss me?

57:56.885 --> 57:58.821
- No!
- You miss me?

58:00.856 --> 58:02.992
You miss me, girl?

58:07.963 --> 58:10.165
No! No!

58:15.838 --> 58:17.772
Come on!

58:39.361 --> 58:41.297
Billy!

58:41.330 --> 58:43.966
Ms. Leslie? Ms. Leslie!

58:58.414 --> 58:59.815
Harms!

59:00.883 --> 59:02.451
Yeah, I can't sleep either.

59:03.652 --> 59:06.388
That Thatch fellow
done return.

59:06.422 --> 59:08.557
Put a knife
to the night clerk's neck.

59:08.590 --> 59:12.328
- Leslie.
- Snagged the key then slit his throat.

59:15.297 --> 59:17.032
You okay?

59:17.066 --> 59:20.402
And this one, Thatch done
started getting frisky,

59:20.436 --> 59:22.171
she blew him right away.

59:25.074 --> 59:27.042
Ah, dang it.

59:27.076 --> 59:28.977
Sick and tired of this.

59:30.179 --> 59:32.047
You all right?

59:32.081 --> 59:37.353
Listen, that stagecoach is gonna
be outside tomorrow morning.

59:37.386 --> 59:39.888
And I want you on it.

59:39.922 --> 59:41.857
And, Billy,
you're going with her.

59:42.991 --> 59:44.560
What about Carol?

59:44.593 --> 59:46.562
Carol ain't here.

59:46.595 --> 59:48.597
Yup.
They done robbed a bank, too.

59:48.630 --> 59:51.333
Left the owner half for dead.

59:51.367 --> 59:54.370
Shit. I better
get up another posse.

59:54.403 --> 59:57.373
I'm going with the posse.

59:57.406 --> 01:00:00.008
We're leaving 15 to 20.

01:00:00.042 --> 01:00:03.979
Billy, I need you
to go with Ms. Leslie.

01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:08.083
I'm gonna find my mother
with or without you.

01:00:08.117 --> 01:00:11.153
Damn it, Billy.
This isn't up for discussion.

01:00:11.186 --> 01:00:13.455
You've got no right
to order me around.

01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.290
I've got every right.

01:00:16.525 --> 01:00:21.964
Kid...
I'm your father's brother.

01:00:23.065 --> 01:00:26.969
No, Uncle Jack
died in the war.

01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:29.138
No...

01:00:34.276 --> 01:00:35.511
I'm Jack.

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.147
No.

01:00:42.317 --> 01:00:44.119
No.

01:00:44.153 --> 01:00:45.621
I told you things.

01:00:45.654 --> 01:00:50.292
Really personal things
I would have never told you.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.394
No.

01:00:53.996 --> 01:00:55.030
No.

01:00:56.465 --> 01:00:58.667
Pa teared up
when he talked about

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.671
how sweet Jack was,
how innocent Jack was.

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:07.109
And you, you are a crotchety,
miserable old...

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:15.050
See, you can't be him.

01:01:23.459 --> 01:01:26.728
There's a stagecoach
outside tomorrow morning.

01:01:33.702 --> 01:01:35.170
Be on it.

01:02:09.137 --> 01:02:10.506
Uncle Jack.

01:02:18.781 --> 01:02:21.316
I suppose I can rethink
the whole

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:25.654
you being dead thing
if I have to.

01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:29.324
Well, kid, there's...

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:32.594
there's more than
one way of being dead.

01:02:34.129 --> 01:02:37.366
Not no more.
I'm ridin' with you.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.368
No you're not.

01:02:39.401 --> 01:02:41.403
You're staying back with Leslie.

01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:47.075
We're kin.
Kin ride together.

01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:50.078
Let's go, boys. Come on.

01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:51.680
There goes the posse.

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:55.217
Hell bent to the leather.

01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:57.820
What time are we leaving?

01:03:02.257 --> 01:03:03.458
Daybreak.

01:03:12.634 --> 01:03:14.136
You all packed up, Billy?

01:03:15.137 --> 01:03:16.138
About.

01:03:23.278 --> 01:03:24.746
What the hell happened?

01:03:26.748 --> 01:03:28.717
We ran into an ambush.

01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:36.725
They popped out of some rocks,
along side a creek.

01:03:37.693 --> 01:03:40.195
We got some of 'em. but...

01:03:40.228 --> 01:03:42.664
I reckon, what,
seven of 'em got away?

01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:43.765
That's right, Deputy.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.736
- Did you see my mother?
- Hell, I don't know, kid.

01:03:47.769 --> 01:03:49.671
We'll get your ma, Billy.

01:03:54.242 --> 01:03:56.445
We've all come this far
together, I'm riding with you.

01:03:56.478 --> 01:04:00.349
Like hell you are.
It's too dangerous.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.718
You need me.
I'm a good shot.

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:04.186
No, you're not.

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:07.723
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:07.756 --> 01:04:11.226
Alright, then.
I'll tell you what, Jasper,

01:04:11.259 --> 01:04:14.596
why don't you round up the boys,
let the horses head back home.

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:18.667
Chalk this up to a loss.
My horse is pretty tuckered out.

01:04:20.937 --> 01:04:24.706
He'll make it to Letterman Ranch
about 20 miles west of here.

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.708
The same way y'all are headed.

01:04:26.742 --> 01:04:29.711
Logan made it that far,
ain't that right?

01:04:29.745 --> 01:04:34.616
That is, if you don't
mind me tagging along.

01:04:36.218 --> 01:04:37.486
Happy to have you.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.863
Billy, get up.
Let's go.

01:05:22.832 --> 01:05:24.332
What do you think, Harms?

01:05:27.502 --> 01:05:29.571
Right there's Letterman Ranch.

01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.277
We got to corral four horses.

01:05:36.745 --> 01:05:38.613
Stockpile four guns.

01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:41.349
Thorn and Thatch no doubt.

01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:46.022
What-what are you
waiting on, Kansas?

01:05:46.055 --> 01:05:47.890
I wanna make a plan, Billy.

01:05:47.924 --> 01:05:50.459
Ma is right there.

01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:52.327
Well, I ain't gettin' shot
for you again.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.662
We ain't got no more time.

01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:55.397
Keep your voice down.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:57.867
What the hell's the matter with you?
Trying out us?

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.268
If you're not going with me,
I'm going by myself.

01:06:00.302 --> 01:06:02.905
There's certain things in life
you're gonna learn the hard way.

01:06:02.939 --> 01:06:04.673
This ain't one of 'em.

01:06:04.706 --> 01:06:06.274
If you're not going,
I'm going by myself.

01:06:06.308 --> 01:06:07.476
- Billy...
- All right.

01:06:07.509 --> 01:06:08.845
- Billy, Billy!
- Billy!

01:06:08.878 --> 01:06:11.413
I'll go chaperone him.

01:06:12.614 --> 01:06:14.549
Billy.

01:06:44.546 --> 01:06:46.916
I remember when you were
just a skinny little kid.

01:06:50.953 --> 01:06:54.723
Just bashful. So quiet.

01:06:54.756 --> 01:06:57.059
And so young
when you went off to war.

01:06:59.796 --> 01:07:04.466
Yeah, and I remember you
a skirt of a girl.

01:07:04.499 --> 01:07:06.668
Chasing after Sam.

01:07:06.701 --> 01:07:07.702
Mm.

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:11.373
I wish I never told you
about me and Sam.

01:07:11.406 --> 01:07:12.407
Hm.

01:07:12.975 --> 01:07:14.811
Sam loved you.

01:07:14.844 --> 01:07:15.878
He did.

01:07:17.746 --> 01:07:19.614
But he loved Carol.

01:07:20.917 --> 01:07:22.717
That's why he didn't go to war.

01:07:24.553 --> 01:07:27.890
But then you joined up. Why?

01:07:29.992 --> 01:07:32.561
What turned you
into a gunfighter?

01:07:32.594 --> 01:07:34.663
Well...

01:07:35.965 --> 01:07:38.868
Probably talking to
women like yourself.

01:07:42.004 --> 01:07:43.806
How are they doing?

01:07:45.942 --> 01:07:48.044
They can't stay out
in the cold.

01:07:48.077 --> 01:07:50.046
Think we're gonna have to...
garden?

01:07:57.186 --> 01:07:58.653
Nah, we'll be fine.

01:08:11.067 --> 01:08:12.467
Come on, Billy.

01:08:30.086 --> 01:08:31.854
Like that, Billy.

01:08:37.692 --> 01:08:39.795
Help me get his jacket
up of him.

01:08:41.496 --> 01:08:42.564
Why?

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.734
They'll think I'm one of 'em.

01:08:46.768 --> 01:08:48.069
And they'll figure
the other's still on guard,

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:49.504
so you can't come.

01:08:49.537 --> 01:08:51.207
Sounds risky.

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.876
I got to see
if my ma's in there.

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:55.111
All right.

01:09:12.795 --> 01:09:15.865
Now go on.
I'll cover you from here.

01:09:26.541 --> 01:09:27.542
Go on.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:34.917
Sense of urgency, Billy.

01:09:53.734 --> 01:09:55.503
Thorn?

01:09:55.537 --> 01:09:56.973
I'm in here, darling.

01:10:05.147 --> 01:10:06.681
Look what I found.

01:10:06.715 --> 01:10:07.950
Oh, let's see.

01:10:08.985 --> 01:10:10.286
Feathers.

01:10:10.319 --> 01:10:11.988
- Yeah.
- I love it.

01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:13.488
Feathers.

01:10:15.057 --> 01:10:16.959
Yeah. Pretty.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.962
Like you. Come here.

01:10:45.254 --> 01:10:46.789
Well?

01:10:46.822 --> 01:10:48.623
There were just two of 'em
standing watch,

01:10:48.656 --> 01:10:49.925
and we got 'em both.

01:10:49.959 --> 01:10:52.995
If we go now,
we can finish this.

01:10:58.067 --> 01:11:02.805
If this thing goes south...
you gotta get help.

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:08.944
You be careful, Jack Cassidy.

01:12:06.936 --> 01:12:09.071
What's going on?
What's going on over here?

01:12:17.947 --> 01:12:20.316
Billy. Billy! Billy!

01:12:26.455 --> 01:12:28.390
Don't you touch my mother!

01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:30.658
- Billy!
- I don't know you.

01:12:30.692 --> 01:12:34.029
Explain yourself before I put
a bullet in your head.

01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:35.264
Thorn, no.

01:12:40.469 --> 01:12:42.304
He's your son.

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.741
What?

01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:49.245
That's my kid?

01:12:51.881 --> 01:12:53.883
Damn fine-looking boy.

01:12:55.384 --> 01:12:56.385
Why didn't you
tell me, Carol?

01:12:56.418 --> 01:12:59.288
Well, you were in jail
when I first found out.

01:13:00.722 --> 01:13:01.824
My mother arranged for me

01:13:01.857 --> 01:13:03.425
to marry Sam Cassidy
right away.

01:13:05.461 --> 01:13:07.029
I didn't have a choice.

01:13:16.372 --> 01:13:18.240
Holster your pistol, Larson.

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:23.778
Well, this just keeps
getting better and better.

01:13:27.983 --> 01:13:29.818
I thought you was dead.

01:13:30.819 --> 01:13:31.954
Not yet.

01:13:38.127 --> 01:13:39.895
Don't you know
who this is, Carol?

01:13:39.929 --> 01:13:43.132
- That's Kansas Red. That's who.
- It's all right, Billy.

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:46.168
That's Jack Cassidy.
I'd know them eyes anywhere.

01:13:47.102 --> 01:13:48.837
Jack's dead.

01:13:48.871 --> 01:13:51.941
You're gonna pay
for putting me in prison.

01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:53.842
That was just petty thefts
all that was.

01:13:53.876 --> 01:13:55.244
Petty theft and a dead man.

01:13:55.277 --> 01:13:58.380
Can we...
can we put this behind us?

01:13:58.414 --> 01:14:00.115
Get out of the way,
Carol.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:02.484
It's been years.

01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:09.858
We're together now.
We have our son.

01:14:09.892 --> 01:14:11.894
He is no father of mine.

01:14:11.927 --> 01:14:15.364
Attaboy.
Got sand. I like that.

01:14:15.397 --> 01:14:18.200
Get along just fine, me and you.

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:22.204
And to answer your question,
Carol, no.

01:14:23.572 --> 01:14:25.074
I can't put it behind me.

01:14:27.309 --> 01:14:28.877
Thorn.

01:14:32.114 --> 01:14:33.249
Thorn, no!

01:14:33.282 --> 01:14:35.985
No, no.

01:14:37.286 --> 01:14:38.554
Thorn, no.

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:40.489
Billy. Billy.

01:14:40.522 --> 01:14:42.091
Carol, thank God!

01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:51.333
Billy.

01:14:53.102 --> 01:14:54.436
You alright?

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:57.106
You just shot
the only man I ever loved.

01:14:58.907 --> 01:15:01.410
Then why didn't you marry him
instead of Pa?

01:15:02.311 --> 01:15:04.280
Because Thorn was in jail.

01:15:04.313 --> 01:15:07.783
And I was with child,
and Sam had the money to take care of us.

01:15:08.517 --> 01:15:09.952
From where?

01:15:09.985 --> 01:15:13.122
The bank robbery?
Or the payroll?

01:15:14.523 --> 01:15:17.092
All those dead men,
and Marianne,

01:15:17.126 --> 01:15:19.028
and-and a woman
from the relay station?

01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:21.330
We found them
on the side of a trail, dead.

01:15:21.363 --> 01:15:24.133
Marianne ran away,
just like you did.

01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:27.936
She just couldn't survive
on her own.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:30.839
Really?
Is that what you think, Carol?

01:15:30.873 --> 01:15:34.076
And what about the people that live here?
Where are they?

01:15:34.109 --> 01:15:36.378
I don't know, Leslie.

01:15:36.412 --> 01:15:38.914
How could you
do this to Pa?

01:15:40.549 --> 01:15:43.118
He wasn't your father.

01:15:43.152 --> 01:15:47.990
Living with Sam was like
living with a cold stove.

01:15:48.023 --> 01:15:50.993
Everything he ever did
he did for you.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.535
Everybody who's dead is dead.

01:16:01.303 --> 01:16:03.038
Well, the others
must have done that,

01:16:03.072 --> 01:16:05.307
because Thorn wouldn't have
killed those people.

01:16:06.542 --> 01:16:08.477
Where have you been
all these years?

01:16:17.019 --> 01:16:19.088
All those years.

01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:06.535
God.

01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:16.078
Here, come here.

01:17:19.515 --> 01:17:21.216
Is it bad?

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.318
Yeah.

01:17:23.352 --> 01:17:25.120
I've really got
to quit gettin' shot.

01:17:25.154 --> 01:17:27.322
Yes, you do.

01:17:29.358 --> 01:17:30.559
Ooh.

01:17:35.297 --> 01:17:38.300
Mm, we've both wasted
a lot of years.

01:17:39.368 --> 01:17:41.103
Yeah, we have.

01:17:46.008 --> 01:17:47.943
We both need to start over.

01:17:58.053 --> 01:17:59.755
- Kansas, we need you!
- No. No, no, no.

01:17:59.789 --> 01:18:02.057
The horses knocked over a fence!

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.696
Yeah, it's never too late
to start.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:33.355
Thorn was gonna be
my whole life.

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:36.058
Now he's gone.

01:18:40.362 --> 01:18:44.266
Gonna sell the ranch,
live in San Francisco.

01:18:44.299 --> 01:18:46.970
Maybe I'll meet someone
that can give me what I want.

01:18:49.671 --> 01:18:52.274
How sad Jack must have been
all these years.

01:18:53.642 --> 01:18:56.612
Going off to the war,
becoming so notorious.

01:18:57.746 --> 01:18:59.548
I really must have
broken his heart.

01:19:02.852 --> 01:19:05.420
And now he's off to Montana
with Billy.

01:19:09.691 --> 01:19:12.528
I'm sorry you have to wait
for the southbound coach.

01:19:13.863 --> 01:19:17.499
Texas is gonna seem
so tame to you now.

01:19:17.533 --> 01:19:22.037
Carol, do you know why
Mother brought me to Texas?

01:19:24.673 --> 01:19:27.209
Because I was in love with Sam.

01:19:30.379 --> 01:19:33.081
But she wanted you to have him.

01:19:33.115 --> 01:19:35.050
And now I see why.

01:19:36.786 --> 01:19:41.456
I ju... I just wish
I hadn't resented her.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:42.825
It doesn't matter now.

01:19:46.328 --> 01:19:50.232
All I want now is Montana.

01:19:52.167 --> 01:19:53.836
So, wish me luck.

01:20:07.616 --> 01:20:09.084
Ma.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.728
Safe travels, Ma.

01:20:22.431 --> 01:20:23.699
You too, son.

01:20:36.846 --> 01:20:39.114
Oh, oh.

01:20:40.182 --> 01:20:41.216
Sneaky, sneaky.

01:20:41.249 --> 01:20:42.618
So that's where it's been.

01:20:44.353 --> 01:20:48.256
Uh, you and me
got some talking to do.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:50.726
It's my money.
Thorn gave it to me.

01:20:50.759 --> 01:20:56.331
It's not your money.
This here is stolen money.

01:20:56.365 --> 01:20:57.834
All I have is my ticket.

01:20:57.867 --> 01:20:59.735
I can't even pay for
a hotel room.

01:20:59.768 --> 01:21:00.736
What would you have me do?

01:21:00.769 --> 01:21:03.372
This here is a good portion
of the reward.

01:21:05.207 --> 01:21:06.876
The rest of this is goin' back.

01:21:11.513 --> 01:21:15.550
Now, listen, why don't you
head on out to San Francisco?

01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:18.453
You write the sheriff,

01:21:18.487 --> 01:21:20.389
we'll help you sell the ranch.

01:21:29.966 --> 01:21:35.270
Now, Ms. Carol... you've been
through too much as it is.

01:21:36.605 --> 01:21:37.773
Safe travels.

01:21:57.894 --> 01:22:00.897
Well, what now?

01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:02.965
It appears this is
the end of the line for us.

01:22:04.299 --> 01:22:05.500
Thank you.

01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:07.569
Till next time.

01:22:09.504 --> 01:22:10.873
Thank you, Deputy.

01:22:10.907 --> 01:22:14.276
You're a good kid.
You'll be all right.

01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:18.547
Well, then. So long.

01:22:37.066 --> 01:22:39.668
You're a sorry-looking pair.

01:22:39.701 --> 01:22:41.971
Ms. Leslie,
why are you going to Texas?

01:22:42.004 --> 01:22:44.339
You can go
to Montana with us.

01:22:44.372 --> 01:22:46.909
I'm gonna buy a ranch
and raise horses.

01:22:46.943 --> 01:22:48.845
Billy, I don't know
about that now.

01:22:48.878 --> 01:22:51.446
She hasn't done anything else
we've asked her to.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.315
That ain't gonna change.

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:56.318
She can cook pretty good.
She rides like a man.

01:22:56.351 --> 01:22:58.020
She hits everything
she aims at.

01:22:59.956 --> 01:23:01.824
I don't want you to go.

01:23:01.858 --> 01:23:03.826
Billy...

01:23:07.864 --> 01:23:12.634
You know, I-I've had
four lives now, and, uh...

01:23:13.903 --> 01:23:15.905
Well, one in Kansas.

01:23:15.938 --> 01:23:21.576
Um, one in a war
that will haunt me forever.

01:23:25.014 --> 01:23:28.084
One wandering years and...

01:23:28.117 --> 01:23:29.484
Well, I...

01:23:31.888 --> 01:23:33.890
I got a chance
to start over now.

01:23:35.624 --> 01:23:40.062
I guess what, um,
what I'm trying to say...

01:23:40.096 --> 01:23:43.431
it just... it just wouldn't be
the same without you.

01:23:52.074 --> 01:23:53.508
I...

01:23:56.411 --> 01:23:58.848
Would you look at me
for a second?

01:23:58.881 --> 01:23:59.949
Just...

01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:08.557
I-I-I'd buy you
that new model Winchester.

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:13.361
And, uh, I'd shine it up
real nice, and..

01:24:14.729 --> 01:24:17.532
And I'd carve-carve
your name in it.

01:24:21.170 --> 01:24:22.470
Um...

01:24:22.504 --> 01:24:25.074
Oh...

01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:35.885
If you marry me.

01:24:39.554 --> 01:24:40.890
And a piano?

01:24:44.193 --> 01:24:46.062
And a wood stove
with an oven?

01:24:46.095 --> 01:24:47.362
Yeah.

01:24:49.764 --> 01:24:51.366
And lots of children?

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:53.702
Ten.

01:24:53.735 --> 01:24:55.737
Ten.

01:25:04.013 --> 01:25:06.082
Yes.

01:25:06.115 --> 01:25:09.085
Yes. Yes.

01:25:20.897 --> 01:25:24.867
She said yes, Billy.
We're going to Montana.

01:25:25.767 --> 01:25:26.836
I'm still the boss.

01:25:27.837 --> 01:25:29.771
- Yes, you are.
- Yes.

01:25:52.694 --> 01:25:55.730
Hey, there's just one
stop I need to make on the way.

01:26:12.148 --> 01:26:13.715
Oh. Oh, God.

01:26:16.852 --> 01:26:21.690
Well, if it ain't
the infamous Kansas Red.

01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:24.827
You know, I almost lost my life
on account of you?

01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.728
Yeah, how's that?

01:26:28.097 --> 01:26:31.133
Well, after you killed
Ben Casey and his boys,

01:26:31.167 --> 01:26:34.270
his brother Slim
showed up looking for ya.

01:26:34.303 --> 01:26:36.471
Well, where's he at now?

01:26:38.074 --> 01:26:41.143
Either heaven or hell.
Ain't for me to say.

01:26:42.111 --> 01:26:43.678
Did you put him there?

01:26:43.712 --> 01:26:46.481
I didn't have any other choice.

01:26:49.718 --> 01:26:52.855
Well, I hope it wasn't too much
of an inconvenience, Doc.

01:26:54.723 --> 01:26:55.724
Thank you.

01:26:57.625 --> 01:26:58.828
Well, what can I do for you?

01:26:58.861 --> 01:27:02.597
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna need
a few more stitches.

01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:07.803
Oh, my God. How many times
have you been shot, son?

01:27:07.837 --> 01:27:11.907
- Well, I lost count. I don't...
- Uh-huh.

01:27:11.941 --> 01:27:14.776
Well, you must have done
something good in your life.

01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:16.979
Otherwise you wouldn't have had
so many chances.

01:27:17.013 --> 01:27:20.615
Well, guess I'll find out
when I get there.

01:27:20.648 --> 01:27:21.884
What do you say, Doc?

01:27:21.917 --> 01:27:24.053
All right, come on,
I'll sew you up.

01:27:27.123 --> 01:27:28.924
You don't want to go
by infection.

01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:30.759
That's a bad way to go.

01:27:30.793 --> 01:27:33.762
Maybe a few ribs there, too.

01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:36.232
Oh, for God sakes.

01:27:48.018 --> 01:27:53.018
