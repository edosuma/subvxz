00:05.770 --> 00:07.897
- YES, JAWS IV.
IT WAS TERRIFYING.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.067
- SHAWN, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHY I'M CONFLICTED HERE.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.566
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO COMFORT YOU

00:11.610 --> 00:13.908
OVER WHAT IS THE WORST SEQUEL
EVER MADE.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.168
- DAD...

00:15.210 --> 00:17.747
- SHAWN, YOU ARE NOT GONNA BE
EATEN BY A SHARK.

00:17.780 --> 00:20.010
SHARKS DO NOT ATTACK PEOPLE
WILLY-NILLY.

00:20.050 --> 00:21.017
THAT'S CRAZY.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.518
SO MANY RANDOM SCENARIOS
HAVE TO LINE UP.

00:23.550 --> 00:25.017
- REALLY?
- OF COURSE.

00:25.050 --> 00:26.813
FIRST OF ALL,
THE SHARK HAS TO BE HUNGRY.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.919
HE HAS TO BE ATI'RACTED
TO JUMPING, KICKING,

00:28.960 --> 00:30.518
OR SUDDEN MOVEMENTS
IN THE WATER

00:30.560 --> 00:32.528
OR MAYBE EVEN SOMEBODY
WITH A CUT.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.822
- BUT ISN'T IT TRUE

00:33.860 --> 00:35.589
THAT MOST SHARK ATTACKS OCCUR
IN 3 FEET OF WATER?

00:35.630 --> 00:36.722
- OF COURSE IT IS.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.863
BUT THAT'S WHERE
THE SWIMMERS ARE.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.094
SO THAT'S A SKEWED SAMPLE.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.994
- DO I WATCH FOR THE FIN?

00:42.040 --> 00:44.065
- NO, THAT ONLY HAPPENS
IN THE MOVIES.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.907
YOU NEVER SEE 'EM COMING.

00:45.940 --> 00:48.932
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED
THE SILENT KILLERS.

00:48.980 --> 00:51.073
- I THOUGHT
THAT WAS HYPERTENSION.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.249
- EITHER WAY,
STOP THINKING ABOUT IT.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.440
COULD YOU DO THAT?

00:55.650 --> 00:56.582
- YEAH.

00:56.620 --> 00:58.645
OKAY.

00:58.690 --> 01:00.783
ANYWAYS, DON'T THEY SLEEP
DURING THE DAY?

01:00.820 --> 01:02.356
- NO, SHARKS NEVER SLEEP.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.449
JUST GET OUT THERE,
HAVE SOME FUN,

01:04.490 --> 01:06.492
AND REMEMBER--
SLOW, STEADY MOVEMENTS.

01:06.530 --> 01:08.851

- CARLTON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:09.690 --> 02:11.157
- NO TIME TO TALK, O'HARA.
JUST KEEP TAKING NOTES.

02:11.190 --> 02:14.353
- WHAT'S THE RUSH?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.163
- THAT.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.929
EVERY TIME WE GET
A HIGH-PROFILE CASE,

02:17.970 --> 02:19.528
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN NEXT.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.961
MAKE SOME CRAZY PROCLAMATION
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

HE'S GONNA BE RIGHT.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.700
WELL, NOT TODAY.

MCNAB?
HOLD BACK THE WONDER TWINS.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.778
- OH, COME ON.
REALLY, BUZZ?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.549
THIS IS THE THANKS I GET
FOR GIVING YOU A CAT

02:34.580 --> 02:37.219

YOUR "BAJA MEN" TATTOO?

02:37.250 --> 02:39.354
- SORRY, GUYS.
HE'S REALLY DETERMINED TODAY.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.880
- LET'S JUST GO.
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.649
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO
DOWN THERE.

02:42.690 --> 02:44.555
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT DEAD THINGS.

02:44.590 --> 02:45.750
- WHAT?
- YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE...

02:45.790 --> 02:49.999
[gagging, gasping]

02:50.030 --> 02:52.362
- NOT ONLY IS THAT AN AFFRONT
TO MY CHARACTER, SHAWN,

02:52.400 --> 02:54.368
BUT I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW,
I'M TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.061
I'M NOW HARDENED.
I'VE SEEN IT ALL.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.965
- YOU'VE SEEN IT ALL THROUGH
THE CRACKS IN YOUR FINGERS

02:58.010 --> 03:00.137
WHILE YOU'RE HIDING YOUR EYES.
- YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.704
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR FOUR YEARS.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.173
I DON'T NEED YOU
TO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.677
I HAVE A NEW NAME NOW.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.076
FOR NOW ON,
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME "GUTS."

03:07.120 --> 03:10.089
- WE ALL CALL YOU THAT.
- NO. "GUTS," SHAWN.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.815
- WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- "GUTS"!

03:11.850 --> 03:13.386
- YOU'RE SAYING "GUTS"?
- YES.

03:13.420 --> 03:15.308
- THAT'S TOO CLOSE TO GUS.
- YOU KNOW, NEVER MIND.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.124

- OLD IRON STOMACH--

03:20.160 --> 03:21.559
THAT'S ME.

- CARLTON, YOU CAN'T SOLVE
A CASE IN FOUR MINUTES.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.991
- CAN'T I? I THINK I CAN.
I'VE SEEN IT DONE.

03:26.030 --> 03:27.691
- NOT BY YOU.
- THANKS FOR THAT.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.332
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

03:29.370 --> 03:32.601
YOU ARE A GREAT DETECTIVE.
IT'S JUST THAT--

03:32.640 --> 03:35.700

- THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM.
IT'S A SHARK ATI'ACK.

NO, THIS ONE'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S CLEANER.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.850
IT'S A KNIFE WOUND.
- A KNIFE WOUND?

03:47.890 --> 03:51.189
- SPENCER WOULD SAY IT.
- YOU'RE NOT HIM.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.712

SEND THEM DOWN.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.513
- GO AHEAD.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.984
- CARLTON,
NO GOOD CAN COME OF THIS.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.988
IT CAN ONLY END DISASTROUSLY.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.726

YOU MEAN TRIUMPHANTLY,

04:25.760 --> 04:27.159
THEN, YES, I AGREE.

- CAN YOU GIVE US ANY DETAILS
ON THE SHARK ATTACK?

04:37.740 --> 04:39.503
- WELL, WE'VE GOT A
COUPLE OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.633
FIRST OF ALL,
OUR VICTIM IS A JOHN DOE.

04:41.680 --> 04:44.148
- AND WHAT'S THE OTHER PROBLEM?

04:44.180 --> 04:46.876
- WATCH HOW I DO THIS.
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

04:46.920 --> 04:51.209
- OUR VICTIM
WASN'T KILLED BY A SHARK.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.810

04:53.860 --> 04:57.250
- [chuckles]
NO, SERIOUSLY.

04:57.290 --> 04:59.258
- NO, I'M--I'M NOT KIDDING.
HE WAS MURDERED.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.895
- WHAT ABOUT THOSE THINGS
THAT LOOK LIKE SHARK BITES?

05:01.930 --> 05:03.363
- YEAH, THOSE ARE SHARK BITES.

- [wheezing]
- AND THOSE AT THE SHOULDER?

05:08.470 --> 05:09.960
- CAN YOU SPELL
YOUR LAST NAME?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.807
- ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU DON'T
KNOW HOW TO SPELL LASSITER?

05:11.840 --> 05:13.705
- NO, I DO.
I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU DID.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.571
- [laughing]
- ONE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.

05:15.610 --> 05:18.078
DOES THE SHARK HAVE AN ALIBI?

05:18.110 --> 05:20.169
- DO YOU THINK THE SHARK
CAN HAVE A FAIR TRIAL

05:20.220 --> 05:21.573
IN THIS JURISDICTION,

05:21.620 --> 05:24.009
OR WILL YOU HAVE TO PICK

- YOU SAW THE KNIFE WOUND,
DID YOU NOT?

07:29.210 --> 07:31.041
AND I'VE REGRETTED IT
EVER SINCE I SAID IT.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.570

THE BEST MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE.

YOU SHOULD FEEL LIBERATED...

YOU'RE FOLLOWING YOUR GUTS!

07:41.190 --> 07:44.227

THE PIECE THAT DIDN'T FIT,

07:44.260 --> 07:46.649
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW IT CONNECTS,

07:46.700 --> 07:49.498
YOU ANNOUNCED IT
TO THE WORLD ANYWAY.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.862
- SPENCER, ONE LOOSE END
DOESN'T MAKE IT FOUL PLAY.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.299
- IT DOESN'T?
- HOW DO YOU THINK

07:53.340 --> 07:55.661
WE'VE STAYED IN BUSINESS
THESE LAST FOUR YEARS?

07:55.700 --> 07:58.339
- BUT WHAT IF IT DOES, LASSIE?
WE'RE COMRADES NOW.

07:58.370 --> 08:01.077
I DO THIS ALL THE TIME.
I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THIS.

08:01.110 --> 08:02.668

08:19.460 --> 08:21.599
- MAKE NO MISTAKE.
THIS IS DEFINITELY YOUR FAULT.

08:21.630 --> 08:22.699
- I'VE HEARD THAT,

08:22.730 --> 08:23.822
BUT I'M TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.326
- WE ARE GOING
TO THE CORONER'S OFFICE,

08:25.370 --> 08:26.462
AND YOU'RE COMING WITH.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.492
- SWEET.
I LOVE THAT GUY.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.839
- ALL RIGHT,
I CAN TAKE IT.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.233
IT WAS A SHARK ATTACK, RIGHT?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.838
- I WAS TOLD TO WAIT.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.801
- FOR WHAT?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.943
- WOODY!

08:38.980 --> 08:41.869
- HELLO, FRIEND.
NOW WE CAN BEGIN.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.411
THE VICTIM WAS CHEWED OFF
JUST BELOW THE WAIST...

08:44.450 --> 08:45.883
- TIN TUMMY.
- IRON STOMACH.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.013
- WAS FOUND WEARING
A VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH,

08:48.060 --> 08:49.857
NOT WATERPROOF...

08:49.890 --> 08:51.755
WHICH IS NOT TYPICAL
OF A SERIOUS BOATSMAN.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.599
WE HAVE NO FINGERPRINTS,
NATURALLY,

08:53.630 --> 08:55.689
AS THERE--
THERE ARE NO FINGERS.

08:55.730 --> 08:57.698
[laughing]
[Gus wheezing]

08:57.730 --> 09:00.233
- CONTINUE.
CUT OFF AT THE WRIST, HUH?

09:00.270 --> 09:01.737
INTERESTING.

09:01.770 --> 09:03.635
- IS THERE ANYTHING
TO HELP US I.D. HIM?

09:03.670 --> 09:05.706
- DENTAL RECORDS
WERE INCONCLUSIVE.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.504
WE DO HAVE THE REMNANTS
OF A BELT,

09:08.540 --> 09:10.599
WHICH MEANS THE MAN PROBABLY
HAD A WALLET ON HIM

09:10.650 --> 09:12.299
WHICH WOULD LIKELY STILL BE
INSIDE THE SHARK,

09:12.350 --> 09:14.318
UNTIL IT'S DIGESTED.

09:14.350 --> 09:15.510
AT THE VERY LEAST,
WE COULD FIND A FINGER IN THERE

09:15.550 --> 09:16.539
WE COULD GET A PRINT
OFF OF.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.717
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- PEACHY.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.878
- ALL RIGHT, I GIVE UP.
OUR PRIME SUSPECT IS A SHARK.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.558
- WHAT? YOU'RE GIVING UP
ON THE MURDER THING ALREADY?

09:23.590 --> 09:25.182
WHAT ABOUT THE SUSPICIOUS
STAB WOUND?

09:25.230 --> 09:26.925
- WELL, NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT,

09:26.960 --> 09:28.496
YOU KNOW, IN THE LIGHTS
AND EVERYTHING,

09:28.530 --> 09:30.168
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
A SHARK-BITE WOUND.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.294
- DON'T DO IT, LASSIE.
DON'T...DO IT.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.967
STICK TO YOUR GUNS.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.604
FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.961
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF
LIKE I BELIEVE IN YOU.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.409
- DO NOT START SINGING
RIGHT NOW.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.431
- ACTUALLY, LASSIE,

09:42.480 --> 09:44.368
THAT PARTICULAR WOUND--
IT'S INTRIGUING.

09:44.410 --> 09:46.275
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S LIKELY,

09:46.310 --> 09:48.312
BUT I CANNOT,
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE,

09:48.350 --> 09:50.215
ACCORDING TO MY OATH,
SAY IT IS NOT A KNIFE WOUND.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.411
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:52.450 --> 09:54.008
- YOU SEE, IT'S...

09:54.060 --> 09:57.223
IT'S JAGGED,
LIKE A TOOTH MARK,

09:57.260 --> 10:00.252
BUT IT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
FROM THE OTHERS.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.962
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL WITHOUT
FINDING THE REST OF THE BODY,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.695
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
MADE BY A KNIFE.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.368
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
I COULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT?

10:06.400 --> 10:07.492
- WELL, THE KNIFE
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE

10:07.540 --> 10:08.996
MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF SHARK TEETH.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.530
- WHAT WOULD THIS KNIFE
LOOK LIKE?

10:10.570 --> 10:13.676
- WELL, UH, PROBABLY
SOMETHING...

10:13.710 --> 10:15.507
LIKE THIS.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.145
AND THEN WE'VE GOT,
YOU KNOW, THE TEETH...

10:18.180 --> 10:19.602
- JAGGED THERE.
SURE.

10:19.650 --> 10:22.778
- DEAR GOD,
WHAT AM I DOING?

10:22.820 --> 10:24.549
THIS IS HALF A MAN.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.989
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LOOK. LOOK AT THAT.

10:26.020 --> 10:27.556
YOU SEE THAT?
YOU SEE IT MATCH?

10:27.590 --> 10:30.058
- IT'S A REACH.
- REACH? LASSIE...

10:30.090 --> 10:31.728
DO YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF BEING WRONG,

10:31.760 --> 10:33.022
OF BEING BEATEN
TO THE PUNCH?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.254
WOULD YOU TRUST YOUR GUTS

10:34.300 --> 10:36.222
AND LET THOSE REPORTERS KNOW

10:36.260 --> 10:38.694
THAT IT IS THEM
WHO ARE ACTUALLY THE DIPSTICKS?

10:38.730 --> 10:41.460
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET A CHOPPER IN THE AIR,

10:41.500 --> 10:43.661
GET US A BOAT
AND A DECENT FISHERMEN.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.462
WE'RE GONNA FIND THIS SHARK,
SLICE IT OPEN, I.D. THE VICTIM,

10:45.510 --> 10:47.637
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO WANTED TO MURDER HIM.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.329
- YES! DO MY THEORIES
SOUND THAT INSANE?

10:49.380 --> 10:50.449
- SOMETIMES INSANER.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.846
- SO WE'RE BACK ON MURDER?
- SHUT IT.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.747
- YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,
I SHOOT YOU.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.317
- THAT IS THE SPIRIT, MAN. YOU
ARE BACK ON THE CRAZY TRAIN.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.910
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I DO IT NEXT?

11:00.960 --> 11:03.019
THAT FELT LIKE A RELUCT ANT NO.
WE SHOULD FOLLOW.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.221
[making exploding
sound effects]

11:12.070 --> 11:13.799
- WHAT IN THE WORLD
IS GOING ON HERE?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.400
- SOMEBODY PUT OUT
A $10,000 REWARD

11:16.440 --> 11:17.737
FOR THE CAPTURE
OF THE SHARK.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.431
NOW EVERY NUT JOB IN TOWN
WITH AN OUTBOARD

11:19.470 --> 11:21.006
IS HITTING THE WATER
TRYING TO FIND IT.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.871
WHOA!
- IS THAT DYNAMITE?

11:22.910 --> 11:24.047
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.719
STOP RIGHT THERE,
YOU BACKWOODS HILL PEOPLE.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.809
THERE IS EVIDENCE
IN THAT SHARK!

11:28.850 --> 11:30.010
GET BACK--

11:30.050 --> 11:31.915
HAVE YOU GOT A LICENSE
FOR THAT?

11:31.950 --> 11:34.089
- THIS IS WHERE
IT GETS HARDER.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.588
- LEAVE ME ALONE.

11:36.620 --> 11:39.054
SIR, I NEED TO COMMANDEER
YOUR BOAT.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.648
- IT'S VEGETARIAN.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.622
- OKAY, SO YOU'RE TELLING ME

11:42.660 --> 11:44.264
THAT EVERY BOAT YOU HAVE
HAS BEEN RENTED.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.268
- EVERY LURE, EVERY REEL.

11:46.300 --> 11:49.804
$10,000 REWARD
IS A LOT OF MONEY, OFFICER.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.229
- REALLY?
YOU SEE THIS?

11:52.270 --> 11:54.431
- WELL, THAT AIN'T GONNA
MAKE A BOAT SUDDENLY APPEAR.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.334
IT ISN'T GONNA FIX
MY ENGINE EITHER.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.575
- REALLY? ALL RIGHT, THEN,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

11:58.610 --> 12:00.578
- CARLTON!

12:00.620 --> 12:02.247
- CHECK WITH ME TOMORROW.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.419
I MAY HAVE THIS THING
UP AND RUNNING BY DAWN.

12:04.450 --> 12:05.940
- NO, NO, TOMORROW'S
WAY TOO LATE.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.254
I NEED YOU TO FIX
THING THING NOW!

12:08.290 --> 12:10.178
- YOU'RE WORSE THAN THAT GUY
IN THE PAPERS.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.879
WHAT'S HIS NAME,
DETECTIVE...

12:11.930 --> 12:14.353
- DIPSTICK!
- NOT ANOTHER WORD!

12:14.400 --> 12:15.890
- WHO'S THAT?

12:15.930 --> 12:17.761
- HE'S NOT WITH ME.

12:20.970 --> 12:22.597
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SUPPORTING THIS,

12:22.640 --> 12:24.335
BUT I HAVE MANAGED TO SECURE
A POLICE BOAT.

12:24.370 --> 12:26.201
- SWEET! WE CAN PUT
OUR HEADS TOGETHER--

12:26.240 --> 12:29.334
TWO MISMATCHED PARTNERS
OFF ON A HAREBRAINED ADVENTURE.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.302
- SPENCER, I WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.341
WE ARE NOT COMPADRES.
WE ARE NOT PARTNERS.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.143
WE ARE NOTHING.
- ARE WE AT LEAST AMIGOS?

12:35.180 --> 12:36.886
- HOMEBOYS?
- PLATONIC SOUL MATES?

12:36.920 --> 12:39.081
- NO.
SHOVE OFF, CAPTAIN.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.111
I'VE GOT A MAN-EATING SHARK
TO CATCH

12:41.160 --> 12:43.025
WITH EVIDENCE INSIDE.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.756
- IT'S ALMOST
AS IF WE'RE NOT INVITED.

12:45.790 --> 12:47.655
[air horn blowing]

12:47.700 --> 12:49.497
NO.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.418
OH, NO.

12:51.470 --> 12:52.960
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NOT YOU TOO.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.137
- WHAT?

12:54.170 --> 12:55.933
- YOU'RE GOING AFTER
THE SHARK REWARD?

12:55.970 --> 12:57.301
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?

12:57.340 --> 12:59.262
- WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE EQUIPMENT?

12:59.310 --> 13:00.800
- THIS STUFF BELONGS
TO A BUDDY OF MINE.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.774
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT, AND
WE'RE GONNA HUNT SOME MARLIN.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.698
- WAYANS? WELL,
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.514
GET OUT THERE, QUICK, BEFORE
THEY MAKE ANOTHER WHITE CHICKS.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.849
- WHITE CHICKS
WAS HILARIOUS, SHAWN.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.085
- LOOK, CARLTON,
SO YOU DIDN'T CATCH THE SHARK.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.156
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE A BAD COP.

13:15.190 --> 13:16.555
IT ONLY MEANS
THAT YOU'RE A BAD--

13:16.590 --> 13:19.286
- FISHERMAN?
I'M SORRY...

13:19.330 --> 13:21.423
WERE YOU ABOUT TO SAY
THAT I'M A BAD FISHERMAN?

13:21.460 --> 13:23.018
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
I AM ONLY SAYING

13:23.070 --> 13:24.799
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
IS NOT A REFLECTION

13:24.830 --> 13:26.127
ON YOUR ABILITIES
AS A DETECTIVE.

13:26.170 --> 13:28.661
I WAS BEING SUPPORTIVE.
- BY SAYING I'M A BAD FISHERMAN.

13:28.700 --> 13:30.600
- ONLY COMPARATIVELY...
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SEE

13:30.640 --> 13:32.699
ANYBODY ELSE
GET THEIR TIE CAUGHT IN A REEL

13:32.740 --> 13:34.605
OR FIRE THEIR GUN POINTLESSLY
INTO THE WATER.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.107
- IT WASN'T POINTLESSLY!

13:36.140 --> 13:38.506
I TOLD YOU, THAT DRIl-TWOOD
LOOKED LIKE A DORSAL FIN.

13:38.550 --> 13:41.519
- THEN WHY DID YOU YELL FREEZE
AND HOLD YOUR BADGE UP FIRST?

13:41.550 --> 13:42.539
- FORCE OF HABIT.

13:42.580 --> 13:43.945
AND WE BOTH KNOW
THAT WE GOT SKUNKED,

13:43.990 --> 13:45.878
BECAUSE WE GOT STUCK
WITH INADEQUATE GEAR.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.387
- IT LOOKED FINE TO ME.
- ARE YOU K--

13:47.420 --> 13:49.183
I WOULD HAVE HAD BE'ITER LUCK

13:49.220 --> 13:51.222
JUST POLITELY ASKING THE FISH
TO JUMP IN THE BOAT.

13:51.260 --> 13:53.728
TRUST ME, O'HARA,
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT FISHING.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.899
- ACTUALLY, I ONCE SPENT
THREE WEEKS WITH MY DAD

13:55.930 --> 13:57.261
ON A CHARTER OFF ISLAMORADA.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.722
WE FED TARPON BY HAND.

13:58.770 --> 14:00.692
- YOU KNOW WHAT, LI'ITLE MISS
"I OBVIOUSLY HAVE DADDY ISSUES"?

14:00.740 --> 14:03.163
IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A TRIP
DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH YOU,

14:03.210 --> 14:06.008
WHY DON'T YOU START BY NOT
INSULTING THE CORE OF MY BEING?

14:06.040 --> 14:08.474
FISHING IS ONE
OF MY TOP-FIVE SKILLS...

14:08.510 --> 14:10.774
RIGHT BEHIND PROFILING
AND SKEE-BALL.

14:10.810 --> 14:13.017
- CARLTON,
YOU ARE TAKING THIS PERSONALLY.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.814
I AM ONLY SUGGESTING
THAT WE BRING IN AN EXPERT.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.818
- WELL, MAYBE I'M SUGGESTING
THAT YOU SHUT IT!

14:17.850 --> 14:20.318
- WOW.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.056
WOW.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.887
- I AM SO SORRY.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.989
I-I'M JUST DEHYDRATED.

14:29.630 --> 14:33.259
[indistinct news report]

14:33.300 --> 14:35.336
- HEY! I HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT THING IN TWO YEARS.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.861
- MAN, I NEED TO GET
MY NUMBERS UP.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.764
WE HAVEN'T HAD A PAYING CASE
IN THREE WEEKS.

14:39.810 --> 14:40.970
- DON'T YOU WORRY.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.069
I'M ABOUT TO CRACK
THE SHARK MURDER CASE.

14:43.110 --> 14:44.145
- WHAT?
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

14:44.180 --> 14:46.478
- CHECK THIS OUT.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.047
SHARK TOOTH FI-LETTER.
- FILLETER?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.684
- THIS THING PROBABLY...
KIND OF MAKES

14:50.720 --> 14:53.086
THE SAME, EXACT WOUND WE SAW
AT THE CORONER'S OFFICE.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.816
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT--
YOU'RE DOING REAL POLICE WORK,

14:55.860 --> 14:57.555
AND LASSITER'S FOLLOWING
SOME CRAZY HUNCH?

14:57.590 --> 14:59.182
- STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

14:59.230 --> 15:00.527
- NAME ONE.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.528
- MICHELLE PFEIFFER
DATED FISHER STEVENS.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.391
AND THEN HE ACTUALLY
CHEATED ON HER.

15:04.430 --> 15:05.897
- IT REALLY WASN'T
ABOUT THE REWARD.

15:05.930 --> 15:07.158
IT'S ABOUT KEEPING
THE WATER SAFE.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.293
BUT, UH, WE GOT HIM.
WE BROUGHT HIM IN.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.500
AND, UH...

15:10.540 --> 15:12.735
WE'LL MAKE A FEW DINNERS
OUT OF HIM.

15:12.770 --> 15:14.829
[camera shutter clicking]

15:23.420 --> 15:26.014
- HA! I KNEW YOU LIED TO ME
AT THE MARINA.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.119
- I DID NOT LIE TO YOU.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.787
I WAS GOING OUT
TO HOOK A MARLIN,

15:28.820 --> 15:30.549
AND I HOOKED
A KILLER SHARK INSTEAD.

15:30.590 --> 15:33.024
NOW I'M A HERO
AND $10,000 RICHER--

15:33.060 --> 15:34.152
SERENDIPITY.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.622
- WE NEED TO SEE THAT SHARK.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.992
- OH, WHAT? OH, SO NOW
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN FISHING?

15:38.030 --> 15:39.463
- SORT OF.
GUS AND I NEED A SUBJECT

15:39.500 --> 15:40.933
FOR AN ICKY THUMP-OLOGY
EXPERIMENT

15:40.970 --> 15:42.267
WE'RE DOING
IN OUR TREE-HOUSE LAB.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.530
- THE STUDY OF FISH
IS CALLED ICHTHYOLOGY, SHAWN.

15:44.570 --> 15:45.730
- THAT'S RIGHT, GUS.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.431
REMIND ME TO PUT IT ON MY LIST
OF FUNNY WORDS,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.630
RIGHT BETWEEN AVUNCULAR
AND MANGROVE.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.079
WE JUST NEED TO SEE
THE SHARK'S TEETH

15:51.110 --> 15:52.771
TO SEE
IF THEY MATCH A WOUND.

15:52.810 --> 15:54.118
- WAIT A SECOND.

15:54.150 --> 15:56.345
ARE YOU WORKING WITH
DETECTIVE DIPSTICK ON THIS?

15:56.380 --> 15:58.541
- YOU'RE CALLING HIM THAT TOO?
- I TRIED NOT TO.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.943
IT JUST ROLLS
RIGHT OFF THE TONGUE.

15:59.990 --> 16:01.719
- WHERE IS THIS THING,
IN THE FRIDGE?

16:01.760 --> 16:03.455
- SHAWN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
IT'S 9 FEET LONG!

16:03.490 --> 16:04.752
I HAVE IT ON ICE,

16:04.790 --> 16:08.226
BUT IT'S
AT AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.420
- I'M GE'ITING SOMETHING.

16:09.460 --> 16:12.258
IT'S NOT DULL.
SHARP'S STORAGE!

16:12.300 --> 16:13.460
DISCLOSED.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.264
- DID YOU JUST PRETEND
TO BE A PSYCHIC, TO ME?

16:16.300 --> 16:18.632
- SORRY. IT'S FORCE OF HABIT.
- NOBODY IS TOUCHING THAT SHARK.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.399
- WE WILL BE IN AND OUT
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.579
- I'VE GOT A PHOTOGRAPHER
COMING DOWN TOMORROW MORNING

16:22.610 --> 16:23.941
TO TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
WITH IT.

16:23.980 --> 16:26.005
- WHAT, FOR YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE?
- NO. MAGAZINE.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.517
- FISH DIGEST?
- BALD GUYS QUARTERLY?

16:27.550 --> 16:28.778
- COOT'S LIFE?

16:28.820 --> 16:31.141
- STOP IT.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.782
- WELL, I FEARED
IT WOULD BE A SPENCER

16:32.820 --> 16:34.253
THAT GOT TO THAT SHARK
BEFORE ME.

16:34.290 --> 16:35.985
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT TURNED
OUT TO BE THE OTHER ONE.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.521
- I THINK
I SHOULD BE OFFENDED. GUS?

16:37.560 --> 16:40.028
- COMPLIMENT TO YOU.
INSULT TO YOUR DAD.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.789
WELL-EXECUTED TWO-FISTER.
- NICE, LASSIE.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.889
- THAT SHARK IS PART
OF MY ONGOING INVESTIGATION,

16:43.930 --> 16:45.363
AND I NEED TO SEE IT, SPENCER.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.867
- OH, THAT SEEMS TO BE
GOING AROUND.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.130
- HENRY, I'M APPEALING TO YOU
AS A POLICEMAN AND A FATHER.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.468
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT BEING A FATHER?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.375
- IT'S OFFICIAL!
YOU HEARD DETECTIVE DIPSTICK.

16:53.410 --> 16:54.832
LET'S DO THIS.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.378
- THERE ISN'T SOMEBODY HERE
TO LET YOU IN?

17:04.420 --> 17:06.149
- HE WAS HERE. HE WAS HERE.
HE HAD THE KEY.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.452
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU CAN DO THIS?

17:07.490 --> 17:10.357
- I CAN DO ANYTHING I WANT!

17:14.100 --> 17:16.898
- SON OF A--
- WHOA.

17:16.930 --> 17:18.761
LASSIE, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.358
BUT I AM NOT GETTING
ANY PLEASURE

17:20.400 --> 17:22.459
OUT OF YOUR "BEFLUSTERMENT"
AT THIS MOMENT.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.832
NOT TRUE--
I'M GETTING A FAIR AMOUNT.

17:24.870 --> 17:26.428
BUT I'M STILL ON YOUR SIDE.

17:26.470 --> 17:28.108
- WELL?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.074
- DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.670
THAT FISH WAS GONNA PAY
FOR MY NEW ROOF.

17:32.710 --> 17:35.474
- WELL, THIS IS JUST GREAT.
SOMEONE STEALS MY SHARK.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.317
NOW THEY'RE IMPEDING
A POLICE INVESTIGATION,

17:37.350 --> 17:39.341
AND WHAT'S MORE,
I LOOK LIKE A TOTAL FOOL.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.483
- I GET IT--ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS IS ALL ABOUT YOU.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.953
- OH, DON'T YOU GET ALL...
- LASSIE.

17:42.990 --> 17:44.685
- SELF-RIGHTEOUS ON ME, HENRY.
- FATHER!

17:44.730 --> 17:47.119
- I AM IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MURDER INVESTIGATION,

17:47.160 --> 17:48.388
AND ALL YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
IS YOUR STUPID PRIZE MONEY.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.261
- A MURDER INVESTIGATION?
- LOOK, GUYS...

17:50.300 --> 17:51.699
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

17:51.730 --> 17:55.029
BUT LET'S BE REASONABLE.
[argumg continues]

17:55.070 --> 17:56.799
- ...AND HID IT
IN A FREAKIN' STORAGE...

17:56.840 --> 17:58.705
- WHERE DID THE LOCK...
- PICK UP A TELEPHONE.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.105
SAY, "HEY, LASSITER, I"--

18:00.140 --> 18:02.973
- THE THIEF WAS HERE RECENTLY,
WITHIN THE HOUR.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.773
- I COULDN'T PICK UP MY PHONE.

18:04.810 --> 18:06.243
I DROPPED IT IN THE WATER.
- WOULD YOU CUT THE CRAP?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.713
YOU SOUND WORSE
THAN YOUR KID!

18:07.750 --> 18:09.877
- SEE THAT TRAIL OF ICE?
IT'S BARELY MELTED.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.649
THAT MEANS WHOEVER DID THIS
IS STILL NEAR.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.749
- SO WHAT, YOU'RE GONNA
TRACK A SHARK ON LAND?

18:13.790 --> 18:15.678
- SOMEHOW IT SEEMS EASIER
THAN DOING IT ON THE WATER.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.119
- I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.128
- I WILL TRACK THIS THING JUST
LIKE I TRACKED THAT SEA LION

18:19.160 --> 18:20.718
TO THE DEEPEST PART
OF THE BIG BLUE.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.024
- YOU STOLE A GUY'S OLD GPS
COORDINATES FOR THAT, SHAWN.

18:23.060 --> 18:25.528
- THAT CHANGES THE RESULT HOW?

18:25.570 --> 18:28.596
I CAN NARROW IT DOWN
TO THAT WAY.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.369
GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.
- NO.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.207
- IT'S A FEW BLOCKS AWAY.
- I DON'T CARE.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.334
- DAD!
- IT'S RIGHT THERE!

18:35.380 --> 18:36.870
- DAD!

18:36.910 --> 18:40.209
I'M SENSING YOUR SHARK.
IT'S NEARBY.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.878
WARM UP YOUR SUPER-SNIFFER.
WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.717
- I GOT IT.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.911
[inhales deeply]
- WE'LL DRIVE.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.684
THE TOOTHED BEAST IS HERE.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.958
- WHERE?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.627
- SOMEWHERE...

18:55.660 --> 18:58.265
O...O-OVER--OVER THERE.

18:58.300 --> 18:59.619
HERE.
- SHAWN...

18:59.670 --> 19:01.262
- NO, IT'S THIS GENERAL...

19:01.300 --> 19:05.100
IT'S THIS GENERAL A-AREA HERE.

19:05.140 --> 19:06.505
PROBABLY...

19:06.540 --> 19:11.568
STUFFED BACK BEHIND
THESE LARGE BEADS OF...

19:11.610 --> 19:13.146
I'M WRONG!

19:13.180 --> 19:16.047
IT'S THIS WAY.
IT'S--

19:16.080 --> 19:19.208
OH, MY GOSH. YEAH.
IT'S DEFINITELY OVER THERE.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.286
THAT'S JUST--
THAT'S JUST FOUL.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.121
-AAH!

19:25.160 --> 19:26.821
OH!

19:26.860 --> 19:29.055
AAH!

19:29.100 --> 19:31.796
[gruntin
AAH! g]

19:31.830 --> 19:33.536
OH!

19:33.570 --> 19:34.969
[groans]

19:35.000 --> 19:37.468
NO. I'M OKAY.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.761
AND THANK YOU SO MUCH

19:38.810 --> 19:43.349
FOR HELPING GET THE BIG,
DEAD SHARK OFF OF ME!

19:43.380 --> 19:45.940
- SOMEONE DIDN'T WANT US
TO FIND THE CONTENTS

19:45.980 --> 19:49.677
OF THIS SHARK'S BELLY.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.540
- WE'RE LOOKING AT A COVER-UP.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.354
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE WRONG SHARK.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.153
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- DR. KIMBERLY PHENIX.

19:56.190 --> 19:58.124
I RUN THE OCEAN STUDIES
DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY.

19:58.160 --> 20:00.822
I'M ALSO A PRETTY DECENT
SHARK EXPERT.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.452
- I DIDN'T CALL
FOR A SHARK EXPERT.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.728
- ACTUALLY, YOU DID.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.227
YOUR PARTNER CALLED ME
YESTERDAY, BUT I WAS OUT.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.636
SO YOU'RE THE ONE THEY CALL,
UM, DETECTIVE DIPSTICK?

20:08.670 --> 20:11.639
- DETECTIVE LASSITER,
CARLTON LASSITER.

20:11.670 --> 20:13.774
HEAD DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.334
- THAT'S OKAY.
I READ THE ARTICLE.

20:15.380 --> 20:18.304
HAD SOME BAD INK MYSELF TOO.
THE PRESS CAN BE SO SNARKY.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.772
- SO HOW'D YOU FIND US?

20:19.810 --> 20:21.175
- I FOLLOWED YOU
FROM SHARP'S STORAGE.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.949
I WAS THE ONE HONKING AS YOU
RAN THROUGH ALL THE RED LIGHTS.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.242
- WHOA. THAT IS
THE GOD-GIVEN RIGHT

20:24.290 --> 20:25.609
OF ANY WORKING
POLICE OFFICER, LADY.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.982
- YEAH, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT HIM.

20:28.020 --> 20:30.329
SO I SAW YOU ON TV
WHEN YOU CAUGHT THIS GUY.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.783
CAN'T SAY I WASN'T
A LITTLE IMPRESSED.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.923
- AH, WELL, THANK YOU,
MISS, I, UH--

20:34.960 --> 20:36.655
- MISS--THAT'S SWEET,
BUT IT'S DOCTOR.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.327
OR JUST KIM.
BUT NOT DR. KIM,

20:38.370 --> 20:40.759
'CAUSE I'M NOT
A RADIO SHOW HOST.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.290
- ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR--
KIM--

20:42.340 --> 20:44.205
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RESPECT FULLY
DISAGREE WITH YOU

20:44.240 --> 20:45.730
ABOUT THAT FISH.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

20:45.770 --> 20:47.328
I'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK.
THIS IS THE SHARK.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.575
IT'S A MAN-EATER,
AND IT'S RARE FOR THESE WATERS.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.146
- YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT ONLY KIND OF.

20:51.180 --> 20:53.910
THE SHARK YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
IS INDEED GALEOCERDO CUVIER--

20:53.950 --> 20:56.168
- A WHAT?
- A TIGER SHARK.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.745
- VERY GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.781
- BUT THE SHARK
THAT A'ITACKED THAT POOR MAN

21:00.820 --> 21:02.617
IS PROBABLY MORE IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD OF A 17-FOOTER,

21:02.660 --> 21:03.820
NOT THIS LI'ITLE GUY.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.749
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT IS NOT A LITTLE GUY.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.758
- DULY NOTED.
AND, YEAH, IT IS.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.392
INCIDENTALLY, I WAS, UM...

21:10.430 --> 21:12.694
GLAD TO SEE THAT IT WAS A
FORMER COP WHO CAUGHT THE SHARK

21:12.730 --> 21:13.890
INSTEAD OF A SHARK HUNTER.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.259
- MY INTENTIONS WERE GOOD.

21:15.300 --> 21:16.892
- HE WANTED THE REWARD
IN A BIG, BIG WAY.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.135
- I WAS TRYING TO KEEP THE
WATER SAFE FOR THE CHILDREN.

21:19.170 --> 21:20.603
- WERE YOU, REALLY?

21:20.640 --> 21:22.301
- ALL RIGHT, THE REWARD
CROSSED MY MIND,

21:22.340 --> 21:24.706
BUT A DIVORCED MAN
HAS TO BUILD HIS NEST EGG.

21:24.750 --> 21:27.548
- DID YOU JUST CASUALLY
SLIP THE WORD "DIVORCED"

21:27.580 --> 21:29.741
INTO A SENTENCE
TO AN APPARENTLY SINGLE WOMAN?

21:29.780 --> 21:31.919
- DID YOU JUST CASUALLY SLIP
"SINGLE WOMAN"

21:31.950 --> 21:33.212
INTO YOUR RESPONSE?

21:33.250 --> 21:35.480
- ToucHE.
[glggllng]

21:35.520 --> 21:36.782
- IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?
- YES.

21:36.820 --> 21:38.981
I THINK YOUR DAD
IS TOTALLY IN THERE.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.157
- OH, PLEASE, GUS,
WHERE'S THE DECORUM?

21:41.200 --> 21:42.428
[cell phone rings]
HE'S HITTING ON THIS POOR WOMAN

21:42.460 --> 21:43.688
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRIME SCENE.

21:43.730 --> 21:46.369
- SHAWN, YOU DID THAT
THREE TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.799
- I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.330
A LEG JUST WASHED UP
OVER ON DODD BEACH.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.702
LET'S GO.
- CARE TO JOIN US?

21:51.740 --> 21:55.335
- I'D LOVE TO.
- AFTER YOU.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.269
- MAN, HE'S GOT EVERY PLAY
IN YOUR BOOK.

21:58.310 --> 22:00.369
OR HAVE YOU BEEN USING
HIS PLAYBOOK ALL ALONG?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.445
WHAT?

22:02.480 --> 22:04.687
- IT'S NOT A BOOK.
IT'S A BINDER.

22:07.390 --> 22:10.848
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
- I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.154
- [whispers] WHO'S THAT?

22:13.190 --> 22:14.896
- MY DAD BROUGHT A DATE.

22:14.930 --> 22:16.397
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS SEEING ANYONE.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.727
- HE MET HER TODAY.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.567
- HE BROUGHT A WOMAN
HE JUST MET TO AN AUTOPSY?

22:19.600 --> 22:20.862
- YEAH, WHO DOES THAT?

22:20.900 --> 22:22.265
- SHUT UP.

22:22.300 --> 22:24.336
- MAYBE IF WE WAIT LONG ENOUGH,

22:24.370 --> 22:26.838
WE'LL BE ABLE TO PIECE THIS
POOR GUY TOGETHER OURSELVES.

22:26.870 --> 22:28.337
- [chuckles]
- [gaQSI

22:28.380 --> 22:30.029
- I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,
YOUNG MAN.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.378
YOU JUST--YOU HAVE TO BREATHE.
IN, OUT.

22:32.410 --> 22:34.048
COME ON, IN, OUT.
THAT'S IT.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.945
CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATHING.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.686
YOU'LL DO FINE.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.609
MASSIVE TISSUE LOSS.
- [wheezing]

22:40.660 --> 22:43.424
- PARTIALLY DENUDED BONE,
AND SOME ODD MARKINGS

22:43.460 --> 22:45.018
RIGHT HERE NEAR THE ANKLE.

22:45.060 --> 22:47.597
ALMOST LIKE HE WAS TETHERED
TO SOMETHING,

22:47.630 --> 22:49.655
LIKE A-A SURFBOARD.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.826
- DO WE HAVE AN I.D.
ON THIS GUY YET?

22:50.870 --> 22:52.326
- STILL PENDING.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.861
WE DO HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY
DATA, AND I-IT'S A BIT ODD.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.266
IT APPEARS IMBEDDED
RIGHT HERE.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.236
SURFACE TISSUE...
WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DNA.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.475
- THE SHARK MUST HAVE HAD
THIS TISSUE WEDGED IN ITS TEETH

23:03.510 --> 23:05.102
WHEN HE CHOMPED DOWN
ON THIS POOR GUY.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.208
- SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

23:06.250 --> 23:08.571
- IT MEANS THERE WAS
A SECOND VICTIM.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.487
[dramatic music]

23:16.220 --> 23:17.585
- THE PREVAILING WISDOM

23:17.630 --> 23:19.029
IS THAT SHARK A'ITACKS
ARE RANDOM ACTS

23:19.060 --> 23:21.790
COMMI'ITED BY A BEAST
DRIVEN ONLY BY ITS NEXT MEAL.

23:21.830 --> 23:24.719
BUT I HAVE A THEORY
THAT TH ESE ATTACKS OCCUR

23:24.770 --> 23:27.022
UNDER CONDITIONS DETERMINED
BY A NUMBER OF VARIABLES--

23:27.070 --> 23:29.061
AIR AND WATER TEMPERATURES,
CURRENTS, TIME OF YEAR,

23:29.100 --> 23:30.362
THINGS OF THAT SORT.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.539
AND THEY'RE ANYTHING
BUT RANDOM.

23:32.570 --> 23:34.970
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

23:35.010 --> 23:36.807
- WHAT? I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR EVERYONE?

23:36.840 --> 23:39.240
THE MACHINE'S
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.385
- ANYWAY, BY PROPERLY
ISOLATING THE VARIABLES,

23:47.420 --> 23:48.853
WE CAN EXTRAPOLATE THE DATA

23:48.890 --> 23:50.824
TO PREDICT AND EVEN PREVENT
FUTURE A'ITACKS.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.020
ANY QUESTIONS?

23:52.060 --> 23:53.721
- YES. HOW LONG
BEFORE THE FINGERS

23:53.760 --> 23:55.352
INSIDE THE SHARK'S STOMACH
ARE DIGESTED

23:55.400 --> 23:56.924
AND NO LONGER USABLE
FOR PRINTS?

23:56.960 --> 23:58.689
- CARLTON, THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE VICTIM NOW.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.664
THE IDEA OF MURDER
IS SEEMING LIKE A STRETCH.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.258
MAYBE WE SHOULD FOCUS
ON THE FACT

24:02.300 --> 24:03.836
THAT THERE'S A SHARK
OUT THERE EATING PEOPLE.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.007
- YES, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

24:05.040 --> 24:06.564
THAT OUR FIRST VICTIM
WASN'T MURDERED

24:06.610 --> 24:08.271
BEFORE HE FELL INTO THE WATER
AND WAS DEVOURED BY THE SHARK.

24:08.310 --> 24:09.504
SO, O'HARA--

24:09.540 --> 24:11.849
- DO NOT INVITE ME
TO SHUT IT.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.108
- I-I WASN'T GOING TO.

24:13.150 --> 24:16.017
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHERE THIS THING IS?

24:16.050 --> 24:17.608
- YEAH.
BASED ON CURRENTS

24:17.650 --> 24:19.379
AND WHERE THE BODY AND THE LEG
WASHED ASHORE,

24:19.420 --> 24:20.785
I CAN GIVE YOU
A BETTER APPROXIMATION,

24:20.820 --> 24:22.458
BUT I'LL NEED SOME TIME
TO RUN THE NUMBERS.

24:22.490 --> 24:24.253
- GREAT. O'HARA, LET'S GET
DOWN TO THAT MARINA

24:24.290 --> 24:25.587
AND GET OURSELVES
SOME REAL EQUIPMENT

24:25.630 --> 24:27.655
AND FIND THE RIGHT SHARK
BEFORE SOME IDIOT IN A SEA BUS

24:27.700 --> 24:29.452
ROLLS OVER IT
WITH A PROPELLER.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.559
- LASSIE, I HAVE NEVER BEEN
MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU

24:31.600 --> 24:32.567
THAN I AM AT THIS MOMENT.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.794
- YOU ARE VIRTUALLY INSANE!

24:33.840 --> 24:35.865
- GE'ITING REAL EQUIPMENT
IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.437
THE MAYOR JUST UPPED
THE REWARD TO $50,000.

24:38.470 --> 24:41.132
- 50,000?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.238
UH, SORRY.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.907
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE WAITING FOR?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.247
LET'S GET DOWN THERE.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.859
- IS IT TRUE THE REWARD'S
BEEN INCREASED?

24:54.890 --> 24:57.529
- YES, THE REWARD
HAS BEEN INCREASED TO $50,000

24:57.560 --> 24:59.380
IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP
THE BEACHES OPEN

24:59.430 --> 25:00.658
DURING THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.521
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE
TO IMPLORE

25:03.570 --> 25:06.198
THE OVERZEALOUS MIDDLE-SCHOOL
DROPOUTS IN THE CROWD

25:06.230 --> 25:08.164
TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.497
HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.804
I'M NOT GOING TO COMMANDEER
YOUR BOATS, PER SE,

25:11.840 --> 25:13.831
ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE I CAN.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.030
JUST KNOW THAT
YOU'LL BE PERFORMING

25:16.080 --> 25:18.298
A GREAT COMMUNITY SERVICE

25:18.350 --> 25:19.772
IF YOU TURN IT OVER US.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.175
OTHERWISE,
I WILL BE ARRESTING YOU

25:21.220 --> 25:23.279
FOR HINDERING
A POLICE INVESTIGATION.

25:23.320 --> 25:25.880
WHAT? O'HARA, I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

25:25.920 --> 25:28.286
- [whispers]
COME HERE.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.878
- DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.285
- WHAT?
WHAT, WHAT?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.651
- WE FOUND A GUY MATCHING
THE VICTIM'S DESCRIPTION.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.918
- GREAT! FIGURE OUT
WHAT HE DOES AND WHO HE IS.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.120
- WE KNOW WHO HE IS.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.593
HE'S A WEB MILLIONAIRE
FROM SEA'ITLE.

25:38.630 --> 25:39.927
HE CAME DOWN
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

25:39.970 --> 25:41.961
- OKAY, THAT'S
A REALLY STRONG MAYBE.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.865
SO PUT MCNAB ON IT AND GET
YOURSELF SOME DRAMAMINE,

25:43.910 --> 25:45.730
BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA
STAY ON THAT POLICE BOAT

25:45.770 --> 25:46.998
TILL WE FIND THE SHARK!

25:47.040 --> 25:48.598
- WE FOUND HIS CAR.
- WOW! NICE!

25:48.640 --> 25:50.699
I'M STILL KIND OF TALKING
TO THE SEA TRASH.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.570
- IT'S IN THE PARKING LOT!

25:52.610 --> 25:54.214
- THIS PARKING LOT?
- YES!

25:54.250 --> 25:55.774
IT WAS ABANDONED
THREE NIGHTS AGO,

25:55.820 --> 25:58.118
AND YOU NEED TO SEE
WHAT'S INSIDE.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.788
- OKAY, LET'S GO.
- YEAH.

25:59.820 --> 26:04.359
[crowd murmuring]

26:04.390 --> 26:07.518
HIS NAME IS DANTE PAVAN.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.994
HE HAS QUITE THE PERSONAL
CRUSADE GOING ON.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.567
HE'S AN OCEAN ACT IVIST,
BIG-TIME.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.136
OIL DRILLING,
WHALE-WATCHING EXCURSIONS--

26:14.170 --> 26:15.535
YOU NAME IT,
HE'S AGAINST IT.

26:15.570 --> 26:17.731
LOOKS LIKE HE'S BROUGHT
HIS PERSONAL CRUSADE

26:17.770 --> 26:19.465
TO SANTA BARBARA.
- DID HE BRING A BOAT?

26:19.510 --> 26:21.330
- NOPE. AND NO RECORD
OF A RENTAL OR A PURCHASE.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.598
NEVER EVEN CHECKED
INTO HIS HOTEL.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.675
- HOW DID HE GET SO FAR OUT
IN THE CURRENT

26:25.710 --> 26:28.372
WITH HIS EXPENSIVE WATCH
AND SLACKS WITHOUT A BOAT?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.741
- HE'S BEEN KNOWN TO STAGE
CRAZY, ELABORATE PROTESTS.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.417
- HOW CRAZY?

26:32.450 --> 26:34.213
- WELL, HE ONCE THREW HIMSELF
INTO A COMMERCIAL FISHING NET

26:34.260 --> 26:35.557
WHILE A LOAD
WAS BEING PULLED IN.

26:35.590 --> 26:38.559
HE CHAINED HIMSELF TO A BUOY
TO PROTEST WHALING.

26:38.590 --> 26:39.955
THAT ACTUALLY MADE THE NEWS.

26:39.990 --> 26:43.289
HE DID THE SAME THING
ON AN OIL-TANKER ANCHOR.

26:43.330 --> 26:45.628
- RATHER ODD MARKINGS
HERE NEAR THE ANKLE,

26:45.670 --> 26:48.798
ALMOST LIKE
HE WAS TETHERED TO SOMETHING.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.068
- LASSIE, WHERE'D YOU GO?

26:50.100 --> 26:51.567
WE WERE TOTALLY
VIDEOTAPING YOUR SPEECH.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.929
- AND WE NEED YOU TO SIGN
A RELEASE

26:52.970 --> 26:54.506
FOR AMERICA'S FUNNIEST
HOME VIDEOS.

26:54.540 --> 26:56.337
- WE'RE WRAPPING THINGS UP.
WE'VE IDENTIFIED OUR VICTIM.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.405
- WHAT, THAT'S IT? YOU'RE
NOT GOING AFTER THE SHARK?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.406
- THE ONLY REASON WE NEEDED
THE SHARK WAS TO I.D. THE BODY,

27:00.450 --> 27:01.917
WHICH WE'VE DONE--
DANTE PAVAN.

27:01.950 --> 27:04.145
HE'S AN OCEAN ACT IVIST
NUT JOB FROM SEATTLE.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.385
LEADS AN EXTREME GROUP
CALLED OCEANS FIRST.

27:06.420 --> 27:09.184
- THAT'S SO THIN.
YOU'RE ACTING INSANE.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.721
- NO, WHAT'S INSANE, SPENCER,

27:10.760 --> 27:12.387
IS THAT I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO
YOU FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS.

27:12.430 --> 27:15.058
THIS IS WHO I AM--
I AM COMFORTED BY THE FACTS,

27:15.100 --> 27:16.453
AND THESE FACTS SOLVE CRIMES.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.388
THIS WAS A SHARK ATTACK,
NOT A MURDER.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.068
- LASSIE, MARK MY WORDS,

27:20.100 --> 27:21.761
THERE IS SOMETHING
IN THAT SHARK.

27:21.800 --> 27:23.290
WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEBODY
STEAL MY DAD'S

27:23.340 --> 27:24.534
AND OPEN THE THING UP?

27:24.570 --> 27:25.639
- I DON'T KNOW, SPENCER.

27:25.670 --> 27:27.035
SOMEBODY WANTED
THE REWARD MONEY,

27:27.070 --> 27:29.277
AND THEY FIGURED OUT
THEY GOT THE WRONG ONE.

27:29.310 --> 27:31.505
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.506
- O'HARA, CHECK
ANY, UH, SNORKELING EXCURSIONS,

27:33.550 --> 27:34.915
WHALE-WATCHING TOURS--

27:34.950 --> 27:37.339
SEE IF ANYONE HAD A DANTE PAVAN
ON THE DOCKET.

27:37.380 --> 27:39.041
BYE, GENTLEMEN.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.149
THIS IS WHERE WE PART WAYS.

27:41.190 --> 27:42.384
- [scoffs]

27:42.420 --> 27:44.149
SO WHAT?
YOU WANT TO GO HOME,

27:44.190 --> 27:45.623
OR YOU WANT TO GO WATCH
YOUR DAD

27:45.660 --> 27:47.799
HIT ON THAT LADY DOCTOR
FOR A WHILE?

27:47.830 --> 27:49.798
- I'D RATHER DIP MY JEWELS
IN HONEY,

27:49.830 --> 27:51.593
THEN GO ON A BEAR WATCH.

27:51.630 --> 27:53.860
OUR WORK HERE IS NOT FINISHED.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.561
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THAT SHARK.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.433
WE NEED SOMEONE
TO TAKE US OUT TO SEA.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.461
- HEY, UH...

28:00.510 --> 28:02.307
EXCUSE--IF YOU COULD--

28:04.010 --> 28:07.138
[soft squeaking]

28:07.180 --> 28:10.069
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT SOUND?

28:11.320 --> 28:15.552
[shrieking]
EE! EEEE! EEEEE...

28:21.430 --> 28:23.990
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

28:24.030 --> 28:26.498
- NO, WE DON'T.

28:26.530 --> 28:30.159
- YOU KNOW
HOW I MAKE MY LIVING.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.033
- WE'RE STILL UNCLEAR
ON WHO YOU ARE.

28:33.070 --> 28:35.231
[bangs podium]
- I'M A PSYCHIC, JACK!

28:35.280 --> 28:36.975
CHECK YOUR PAPERS,
NOT THE FRONT--

28:37.010 --> 28:39.342
PAGE FIVE AND FURTHER BACK,
SOMETIMES THE PERSONALS.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.042
BUT BELIEVE ME...
IT'S ALL THERE.

28:42.080 --> 28:46.187
WE REMEMBER SHABBY, DON'T WE?
SHABBY THE SEA LION?

28:46.220 --> 28:47.585
WELL, I TRACKED HIM AT SEA,

28:47.620 --> 28:50.259
FOUND OUT WHERE
THE POOR FELLOW WAS MURDERED...

28:50.290 --> 28:51.723
IN THE ENTIRE OCEAN,

28:51.760 --> 28:53.421
THE EXACT SPOT.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.552
TELL THEM, GUS.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.090
- I'D RATHER NOT.

28:56.130 --> 28:58.792
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
I FOUND AN ABANDONED BOAT...

28:58.830 --> 28:59.990
AT SEA AT NIGHT.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.931
I HAVE KEEN SENSES.
MY SENSES ARE VERY KEEN.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.302
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GONNA LAY OUT
MY HISTORY FOR YOU PEOPLE,

29:05.340 --> 29:06.739
AND BY THE END OF IT,

29:06.770 --> 29:09.477
YOU'RE ALL GONNA BE BEGGING
FOR MY SERVICES, OKAY?

29:09.510 --> 29:11.444
FOUR MONTHS AGO,
GUY WALKS INTO OUR OFFICE,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.107
SAYS, "HELP ME.
I'M A LYCAN."

29:13.150 --> 29:14.777
GUS IS LIKE,
"YOU'RE MADE OUT OF SEAWEED?"

29:14.820 --> 29:17.471
I SAID, "NO, NO, GUS.
HE'S A WEREWOLF."

29:17.520 --> 29:19.886
WE DRESSED UP
LIKE CIVIL WAR PEOPLE,

29:19.920 --> 29:23.549
AND GUS LOOKED LIKE
DENZEL WASHINGTON IN GLORY.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.524
AND SOME GUY BUILT A TUNNEL...

29:25.560 --> 29:27.425
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO,

29:27.460 --> 29:29.621
SOME CHICK GOT HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH A TENNIS--

29:29.660 --> 29:31.298
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SCREW THAT CASE.

29:31.330 --> 29:33.093
I LOOKED AT MY PARTNER.

29:33.130 --> 29:35.496
IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT A CHILD
LOST IN A SHOPPING MALL.

29:35.540 --> 29:38.008
LUCKILY,
I'D SOLVED THE CASE.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.258
THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
WERE PROTECTING THEIR BONUSES,

29:40.310 --> 29:42.608
AND THAT IS WHY THEY LEI-T
THE DISEMBODIED FOOT

29:42.640 --> 29:44.073
ON THE PATH IN THE FOREST.

29:44.110 --> 29:46.044
- THAT'S NOT WHY THEY DID IT.
- YEAH, WELL, UH...

29:46.080 --> 29:47.342
THAT ONE STILL CONFUSES ME.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.940
THE POINT IS,
THAT IS BUT 20

29:49.980 --> 29:52.517
OF MY MANY, MANY CASES
THAT I HAVE SOLVED.

29:52.550 --> 29:55.348
YOU CAN READ THE BOOK
WHEN I LEARN HOW TO TYPE.

29:55.390 --> 29:57.255
SIR, THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVEN'T LEI-T

29:57.290 --> 30:00.054
SHOWS ME YOU'RE NOT
AFRAID OF MY GIl-T...

30:01.430 --> 30:06.163
AND ARE READY TO USE IT
TO CATCH THIS SHARK.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.430
I THINK WE HAVE OURSELVES
A BOAT.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.630
ARE WE GONNA GET TO SING
SEA CHANTEYS

30:13.670 --> 30:16.104
OR ANY OTHER KIND
OF CHANTEYS?

30:16.140 --> 30:19.246
DO YOU HAVE DRAMAMINE,
OR SHOULD I JUST BRING MY OWN?

30:19.280 --> 30:21.271
OH, GUS WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU HAVE CABLE ON YOUR BOAT,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.015
BECAUSE IT'S THE SEASON
FINALE OF LEVERAGE,

30:23.050 --> 30:24.278
AND HIS TIVO'S ON THE FRITZ.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.844
- YOUR JOB IS TO SHUT UP.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.517
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S EASY.

30:27.550 --> 30:29.086
I WAS WORRIED I WOULD DRAW
SWABBING THE DECKS,

30:29.120 --> 30:30.610
WHICH IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT
THAN REMAINING QUIET.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.082
- YOU'RE FAILING
AT YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.119
- SAYS YOU.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.219
- SAYS THE DEFINITION
OF SHUT UP.

30:35.260 --> 30:38.821
YEAH. I NEED
TO GET OFF THIS BOAT.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.930
- GUS, DON'T BE LEON FROM
THE LIKE OF PRAYER VIDEO...

30:41.970 --> 30:43.494
OR ANYTHING, FOR THAT MA'ITER.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.134
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY GET
TO SEE A WHALE.

30:46.170 --> 30:48.035
- FINE.
BUT AFTER THE WHALE.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.607
- HEY. YOU'RE
ON CHUM DUTY, PRINCESS.

30:51.650 --> 30:56.075
- [wheezing]

30:56.120 --> 30:59.988
[gagging]

31:00.020 --> 31:01.351
- NICE.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.169
- ALL RIGHT, MAGICIAN,
WHERE DO WE GO?

31:13.200 --> 31:16.931
- WELL, UH, SHARKS ARE
VERY UNPREDICT ABLE, YOU KNOW,

31:16.970 --> 31:18.938
SILENT, BUT DEADLY.

31:18.970 --> 31:21.370
IF IT IS HE WHO SMELT IT,

31:21.410 --> 31:23.037
THEN...

31:23.080 --> 31:24.843
IT IS ALSO HE WHO--

31:24.880 --> 31:26.347
WHO MOST LIKELY DEALT IT.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.541
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:28.580 --> 31:30.138
- UH...

31:30.180 --> 31:31.716
- THESE A'ITACKS OCCUR
UNDER CONDITIONS

31:31.750 --> 31:33.217
DETERMINED BY A NUMBER
OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES--

31:33.250 --> 31:35.150
AIR AND WATER TEMPERATURE,
TIME OF YEAR, CURRENTS,

31:35.190 --> 31:37.317
AND THEY'RE ANYTHING
BUT RANDOM.

31:37.360 --> 31:40.727
- I AM SENSING
A NUMBER OF VARIABLES HERE--

31:40.760 --> 31:43.456
UH, AIR AND WATER TEMPERATURES,
CURRENTS, THE TIME OF YEAR.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.627
THE SHARK IS DEFINITELY
IN A PATTERN.

31:45.670 --> 31:48.662
- ARE YOU A BIOLOGIST
OR A PSYCHIC?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.895
- [chuckling]
WELL...

31:57.110 --> 31:59.271
THE REEF!
YES.

31:59.310 --> 32:00.538
I CAN SEE IT, THE REEF.

32:00.580 --> 32:03.469
THERE IS A HAREM OF SEALS
GATHERED THERE TO MATE

32:03.520 --> 32:06.489
AND MAKE SUCCULENT FONDUES.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.785
THE SHARK IS ALSO THERE...

32:09.820 --> 32:11.128
WAITING.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.754
- I KNOW THAT SPOT.

32:13.790 --> 32:17.794
A POD SEALS HAS BEEN
SE'ITLED IN THE AREA.

32:17.830 --> 32:19.889
YOU MIGHT BE WORTH
SOMETHING AI-TER ALL.

32:19.930 --> 32:21.989
- HA!
[mutters]

32:22.040 --> 32:25.635
BUT I BELIEVE IT'S A...
IT IS A HAREM OF SEALS.

32:25.670 --> 32:28.207
- AH! I'VE HEARD IT
BOTH WAYS.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.518
- HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.338
- [sighs]
OKAY, WE NEED TO FIND OUT

32:39.390 --> 32:41.483
WHAT KIND OF PROTEST STUNT
PAVAN PULLED

32:41.520 --> 32:43.852
IN ORDER TO GET HIMSELF
ACCIDENTALLY EATEN BY A SHARK.

32:43.890 --> 32:45.858
- MAYBE IT WASN'T A STUNT.

32:45.890 --> 32:47.426
MAYBE IT WASN'T EVEN
AN ACCIDENT.

32:47.460 --> 32:49.428
MAYBE WE JUMPED OFF MURDER
TOO SOON.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.121
- YOU WITH SPENCER
ON THIS NOW?

32:51.170 --> 32:53.593
COME ON, O'HARA, I JUST GOT
MY HEAD BACK ON STRAIGHT.

32:53.630 --> 32:55.894
- LOOK AT THIS LE'ITER I FOUND
IN THE COURIER FROM LAST MONTH.

32:55.940 --> 32:57.168
- THE COURIER?
NO.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.633
I WOULD RATHER
FRENCH-KISS A HOBO

32:58.670 --> 33:00.137
THAN READ ANYTHING
IN THAT RAG.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.728
- WOW. A SIMPLE
"I DON'T LIKE THE WRITING"

33:01.780 --> 33:03.509
WOULD HAVE MADE YOUR POINT.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.100
- I'M SORRY, O'HARA--THAT PAPER
IS NOT ALLOWED IN THIS STATION.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.845
- SO YOU'RE GOING
TO IGNORE A CLUE

33:07.880 --> 33:09.472
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
A REPORTER?

33:09.520 --> 33:11.078
- HATE.
HATE IS THE WORD, O'HARA,

33:11.120 --> 33:12.985
AND, YES, NO GOOD
CAN BE FOUND IN THAT PAPER,

33:13.020 --> 33:15.488
EXCEPT MAYBE THE OBITUARY
FOR REPORTER CHAD GORSUCH.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.680
- REALLY?
- AN UNTIMELY DEATH--

33:16.720 --> 33:18.529
SELF-INFLICT ED AND PAINFUL.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.051
LATER TO BE REFERRED TO
AS GOR-SUCHING YOURSELF.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.819
NO! HE'S ON A RESPIRATOR
AND DYING SLOWLY!

33:23.860 --> 33:26.226
OH, THAT WAS VERY THERAPEUTIC.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.261
I ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE BE'ITER.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.699
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

33:29.740 --> 33:31.901
- IT'S AN OPEN LETTER TO
"THE CRIMINAL FISHING INDUSTRY

33:31.940 --> 33:33.134
OF SANTA BARBARA."

33:33.170 --> 33:35.707
IT'S FANCILY WORDED
AND A LITTLE RAMBLING,

33:35.740 --> 33:38.049
BUT IT BASICALLY SAYS, "STOP
YOUR ILLEGAL FISHING PRACTICES,

33:38.080 --> 33:39.672
OR I WILL."

33:39.710 --> 33:41.177
- SO HE WAS TAKING ON
THE WHOLE INDUSTRY?

33:41.220 --> 33:44.018
- QUESTION IS--WHO WAS
HE GOING Al-TER FIRST?

33:50.390 --> 33:52.255
- MOVE FASTER, YA PANTYWAIST!

33:52.290 --> 33:53.450
TIME'S WASTING!

33:53.490 --> 33:56.550
THERE'S 200 OTHER LINES
IN THE WATER RIGHT NOW!

33:56.600 --> 33:59.023
- OH, THAT IS
REALLY GROSS, HUH?

33:59.070 --> 34:00.264
- YOU NEED TO TAKE OVER.

34:00.300 --> 34:02.234
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
- WHY NOT?

34:02.270 --> 34:04.329
- I'VE GOT TO HAVE ONE HAND
FREE TO DO THIS.

34:04.370 --> 34:06.167
ASK TANNER TO DO IT.

34:06.210 --> 34:09.202
- HE SAYS HE HAS A BAD WING.
- WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

34:09.240 --> 34:11.105
- I DON'T KNOW!
I DON'T SPEAK SALTY FISHERMAN.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.401
- WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN HERE?

34:12.450 --> 34:14.247
WE'RE RIGHT OVER THE REEF.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.111
I NEED MORE, PSYCHIC.

34:16.150 --> 34:18.539
- WELL, I NEED, UH, QUIET...

34:18.590 --> 34:20.239
IS WHAT I NEED.

34:20.290 --> 34:23.009
IS THERE A BED IN THERE
THAT I CAN LAY DOWN ON

34:23.060 --> 34:25.221
AND A PILLOW
THAT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE FISH?

34:25.260 --> 34:28.195
WHAT THE--

34:28.230 --> 34:30.323
I'M ALSO GONNA NEED
A LITTLE BOY'S ROOM.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.464
- * CHUM, CHUM

34:42.380 --> 34:43.870
[cell phone ringing]

34:43.910 --> 34:46.378
[smooth jazz music playing]

34:46.410 --> 34:48.173
- HELLO?
- HEY, DAD, HELP ME OUT HERE.

34:48.220 --> 34:49.972
I NEED THE NUMBER
FOR THAT DOCTOR LADY.

34:50.020 --> 34:52.113
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.481
- SHAWN...

34:53.520 --> 34:57.684
- OKAY, FINE, IT, UH--IT RHYMES
WITH PFARK PUNTING.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.028
- SHAWN, PLEASE TELL ME

34:59.060 --> 35:00.789
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING Al-TER THAT SHARK.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.297
- I JUST NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR LADY FRIEND.

35:02.330 --> 35:04.218
- WELL, YOU CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

35:04.270 --> 35:05.669
- SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.622
- SHE'S THERE?
- YES.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.932
- [laughs]
OF COURSE SHE IS.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.938
FINE.
IT'S FINE.

35:10.970 --> 35:12.528
HAVE HER TELL YOU
THROUGH THE DOOR

35:12.570 --> 35:14.060
WHERE THE SHARK IS,

35:14.110 --> 35:17.034
BECAUSE INSIDE ITS BELLY
IS EVIDENCE IN A MURDER CASE.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.809
- SHAWN, I'M HANGING UP.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.477
- NO, NO, NO, WAIT A SEC.
DAD, DAD, DAD, DAD.

35:20.510 --> 35:22.319
JUST TELL HER
TO GIVE ME A PHRASE,

35:22.350 --> 35:24.147
JUST A PHRASE--ANYTHING.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.146
SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS
OCEANOGRAPHERY-ISH.

35:26.190 --> 35:29.182
- GOOD-BYE.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.949
- DAD.

35:30.990 --> 35:32.958
THAT FIGURES.

35:32.990 --> 35:35.720
WHAT DO WE GOT?
WE GOT, UH...

35:35.760 --> 35:36.727
WE GOT MAPS,

35:36.760 --> 35:39.558
CHARTS, THINGS WITH...

35:39.600 --> 35:42.364
LONGITUDE AND ALL THE 'TUDES!

35:44.070 --> 35:45.435
OH...

35:50.110 --> 35:53.273
BULL'S-EYE, BULL'S-EYE,
BU LL'S-EYE.

36:00.890 --> 36:04.053
- DANTE PAVAN, HE'S AN OCEAN
ACT IVIST NUT JOB FROM SEATTLE.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.631
- IT'S JAGGED...

36:18.670 --> 36:20.001
LIKE A TOOTH MARK.

36:20.040 --> 36:22.133
A KNIFE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE
MANY OF THE CHARACTERISTICS

36:22.180 --> 36:24.341
OF SHARK TEETH,
LIKE THIS...

36:28.780 --> 36:30.042
- WHAT ARE YOU STILL
DOING DOWN--

36:30.080 --> 36:31.445
- SHH.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.640
I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.

36:33.690 --> 36:34.952
- WHO?

36:34.990 --> 36:37.185
- WE'RE ON HIS BOAT.

36:42.130 --> 36:44.598
- HOW DO YOU KNOW TANNER--
- SHH!

36:44.630 --> 36:47.360
- [whispers] HOW DO YOU
KNOW TANNER IS THE KILLER?

36:47.400 --> 36:49.095
- TANNER HAS
A STACK OF VIOLATIONS

36:49.140 --> 36:50.789
AS DEEP
AS THE OCEAN FLOOR.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.899
PAVAN WAS
AN ACT IVIST, REMEMBER?

36:52.940 --> 36:54.635
TANNER IS JUST THE KIND
OF OLD-SCHOOL VIOLATOR

36:54.680 --> 36:56.033
THAT HE WAS RAILING AGAINST.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.604
- THAT'S JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.972
- WHO ARE YOU, LASSITER?
WH--WHAT ABOUT THESE?

37:00.010 --> 37:02.274
- SHARK-TOOTHED KNIVES?
- EXACTLY!

37:02.320 --> 37:04.288
ONE OF THOSE
COULD HAVE MADE THAT WOUND.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.982
- WAIT A SECOND...
WHERE'S THE MEDIUM ONE?

37:07.020 --> 37:09.181
- EXACTLY, GUS--
WHERE IS THE MEDIUM ONE?

37:09.220 --> 37:10.983
IT'S MISSING.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.921
BECAUSE TANNER USE_D IT TO...
[blows through lips]

37:13.960 --> 37:15.222
KILL PAVAN.

37:15.260 --> 37:16.818
- THAT'S NOTHING
BUT A WILD GUESS.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.999
- IT FITS SOMEHOW, GUS.

37:19.030 --> 37:20.964
THAT'S WHY LASSITER'S ALWAYS
A HALF A STEP BEHIND US,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.093
BECAUSE
WE FOLLOW OUR INSTINCT S,

37:23.140 --> 37:24.801
AND YOUR FIRST INSTINCT
IS PURE,

37:24.840 --> 37:26.467
AND YOU GOT TO GRAB IT--
- HEY, SHAWN!

37:26.510 --> 37:28.273
I GOT HIM!

37:28.310 --> 37:31.279
I GOT THE SON OF A BITCH!

37:31.310 --> 37:34.916
DON'T JUST STAND THERE--
HELP ME HAUL IT IN!

37:34.950 --> 37:36.679
GUSTER!
DYNAMITE.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.779
GET THAT DYNAMITE!

37:38.820 --> 37:40.447
- ARE YOU CRAZY?
WE'RE TAKING THIS THING IN.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.752
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

37:41.790 --> 37:44.281
WE'RE GONNA DESTROY IT
BEFORE IT DESTROYS US!

37:44.330 --> 37:46.025
NOW GO!

37:49.930 --> 37:53.468
- SURFACE TISSUE...
WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DNA.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.695
- SHARK MUST HAVE HAD
THIS TISSUE WEDGED IN HIS TEETH

37:55.740 --> 37:57.196
WHEN HE CHOMPED DOWN
ON THIS POOR GUY.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.208
- YOU WERE THE OTHER VICTIM,
WEREN'T YOU, TANNER?

37:59.240 --> 38:00.537
- COME AGAIN?

38:00.570 --> 38:02.709
- THAT SHARK
TOOK A BITE OUT OF YOU.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.970
IT WAS YOUR TISSUE
WEDGED IN HIS TEETH

38:05.010 --> 38:06.841
WITH YOUR DNA.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.668
YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN IN TROUBLE
WITH VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES

38:10.720 --> 38:13.018
FOR YEARS,
BUT YOU WOULDN'T CHANGE.

38:13.050 --> 38:16.053
DANTE PAVAN TRIED TO STOP YOU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

38:16.090 --> 38:18.422
THAT'S WHY YOU KILLED HIM
IN A STRUGGLE,

38:18.460 --> 38:20.724
THEN GOT RID OF THE EVIDENCE
THE BEST WAY YOU KNEW HOW--

38:20.760 --> 38:23.422
DRAWING A SHARK IN
TO DEVOUR THE BODY,

38:23.460 --> 38:25.360
STAB WOUND AND ALL.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.197
BUT SOMEHOW,
THE SHARK GOT THE KNIFE

38:27.230 --> 38:31.337
AND A PIECE OF YOU TOO.

38:31.370 --> 38:32.769
WHEN THEY CAUGHT
THAT FIRST SHARK,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.835
YOU STOLE IT
AND SLICED HIM OPEN...

38:34.880 --> 38:36.302
'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT
THE ONLY EVIDENCE

38:36.340 --> 38:39.548
THAT COULD BRING YOU DOWN
WAS STUCK IN ITS BELLY.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.047
BUT IT WAS THE WRONG SHARK!

38:41.080 --> 38:43.674
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP
UNTIL YOU FIND THE RIGHT SHARK

38:43.720 --> 38:46.041
AND GET RID OF THE EVIDENCE
INSIDE OF HIM FOR GOOD.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.887
- [grunts]

38:47.920 --> 38:50.684
- FORGET THIS!

38:52.060 --> 38:54.927
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING, BOY?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.097
- YOU'RE FINISHED, TANNER.

38:56.130 --> 38:59.725
- OH, I THINK
THIS IS GONNA GET MESSY.

38:59.770 --> 39:00.998
- I'M THE ONE
WITH THE KNIFE, MAN.

39:01.030 --> 39:03.692
- OH! IF THAT SHARK
COULDN'T TAKE ME DOWN,

39:03.740 --> 39:06.061
I DON'T THINK YOU

39:06.110 --> 39:07.509
AND THE RETCHING PANTYWAIST

39:07.540 --> 39:10.100
HERE WILL--AAH!

39:10.140 --> 39:11.778
- THAT'S FOR CALLING ME
A PANTYWAIST.

39:11.810 --> 39:14.779
THERE'S NO SHAME
IN HAVING A GAG REFLEX.

39:14.820 --> 39:16.617
IT'S A SIGN
THAT I'M HIGHLY EVOLVED.

39:16.650 --> 39:19.346
I DID A BIT OF RESEARCH,
AND WHAT I FOUND WAS--

39:19.390 --> 39:20.516
- GUS, HE'S OUT COLD.

39:20.550 --> 39:22.051
- OH.

39:22.090 --> 39:25.184
- IT WAS NICE, THOUGH.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.279
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW TO DRIVE THIS THING?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.434
- LASSIE. I'LL BE NEEDING
A FAVOR FROM YOU.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.097
WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE

39:36.140 --> 39:39.337
THAT THE CHIEF
GETS ONE OF THESE?

39:39.370 --> 39:41.873
- WELL, OF COURSE I'LL MAKE
SURE SHE GETS ONE OF THESE.

39:41.910 --> 39:43.832
I PROMISE.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.768
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WRITE THE HEADLINES,

39:45.810 --> 39:47.539
BUT IF I DID,
I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ADDED

39:47.580 --> 39:49.309
AND DOES SO
WITH FOPPISH APLOMB.

39:49.350 --> 39:50.419
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

39:50.450 --> 39:51.917
- IF YOU TAKE TIME
TO READ THE ARTICLE,

39:51.950 --> 39:53.417
YOU'LL SEE THAT
WE DID YOU JUSTICE.

39:53.450 --> 39:54.781
- IT SHOULD EFFECT IVELY QUASH

39:54.820 --> 39:56.651
ALL THAT
DETECTIVE DIPSTICK TALK.

39:56.690 --> 39:57.952
- EXCEPT IN OUR OFFICE,
OF COURSE.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.787
BUT YOU WOULDN'T BEGRUDGE
US THAT.

39:59.830 --> 40:01.559
I JUST WANTED TO SAY...

40:01.600 --> 40:03.556
YOU WERE THIS CLOSE, MAN.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.488
YOU WERE RIGHT THERE
AT THE PRECIPICE.

40:05.530 --> 40:07.327
YOU WERE NEXT TO US.

40:07.370 --> 40:09.861
BUT YOU WSOCJJLDN'T JUMP.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.765
DO THESE ACCOLADES FEEL GOOD?
YES, THEY DO.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.402
BUT IT SHOULD BE YOU
RIGHT THERE WITH US

40:13.440 --> 40:14.407
ON THE FRONT PAGE.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.579
- BEHIND ME.
- RIGHT BEHIND GUS.

40:16.610 --> 40:17.872
NOT BECAUSE
YOU'RE ANY LESS IMPORTANT.

40:17.910 --> 40:19.548
- BUT BECAUSE
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT TALLER.

40:19.580 --> 40:21.400
- AND BECAUSE MAYBE
YOU'RE SLIGHTLY LESS IMPORTANT.

40:21.450 --> 40:22.542
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

40:22.580 --> 40:24.116
THE PRESS CAN WRITE
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.287
I'M OVER IT.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.810
SERIOUSLY,
I DON'T WANT TO BE YOU,

40:26.850 --> 40:28.215
NOT FOR ONE MINUTE.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.309
I DON'T WANT TO THROW OUT
FIVE CRAZY THEORIES

40:30.360 --> 40:31.987
JUST TO GET ONE RIGHT.

40:32.030 --> 40:33.122
I AM A POLICE DETECTIVE,

40:33.160 --> 40:34.855
AND POLICE DETECT IVES
DO NOT SURMISE

40:34.900 --> 40:36.197
THAT BANKS ARE KNOCKED OVER

40:36.230 --> 40:37.857
BY GROUPS OF ANGRY CATS
WITH LASER BEAMS.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.458
- I NEVER SAID
THEY WERE ANGRY.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.865
THEY WERE SIMPLY
FOLLOWING ORDERS.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.663
- REGARDLESS,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

40:42.700 --> 40:45.464
I DO GOOD POLICE WORK,
AND PEOPLE RESPECT ME FOR IT.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.398
- NAME TWO.
- NAME ONE.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.271
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE MA'ITERS.

40:49.310 --> 40:50.277
- MA'ITERS?

40:50.310 --> 40:51.800
- IT MEANS
LEAVE BEFORE I GET RUDE.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.545
- OH!
- OH, COME ON, NOW.

40:53.580 --> 40:54.877
I THINK WE'RE PAST THAT.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.649
JUDGES?
- CONCUR.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.614
- OUT.

40:58.650 --> 41:01.858
- BYE, LASSIE.
- SEE YOU LATER, BUDDY.

41:01.890 --> 41:04.313
HERE.

41:14.870 --> 41:17.668
- HEY! SINCE WHEN
DO YOU HAVE A KEY?

41:17.700 --> 41:20.100
- I DON'T. SINCE WHEN
DO YOU NOT LOCK YOUR DOORS?

41:20.140 --> 41:21.937
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR SOME SUNSCREEN.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.333
WE'RE GOING OUT ON THE WATER,

41:23.380 --> 41:26.406
AND I NEED A LITTLE PROTECTION
FROM THE SUN...

41:26.450 --> 41:27.769
AND KIM'S SMILE.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.311
' [giggling]

41:29.350 --> 41:31.215
- NOTHING LESS THAN SPF 50.

41:31.250 --> 41:33.684
- OH, YOUR DAD IS ONE
