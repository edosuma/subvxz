00:35.560 --> 00:38.245
<i>The Earth is at peace.</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:42.602
<i>There is no hunger.</i>

00:45.800 --> 00:48.246
<i>There is no violence.</i>

00:50.120 --> 00:52.487
<i>The environment is healed.</i>

00:56.760 --> 01:01.163
<i>Honesty, courtesy and kindness
are practiced by all.</i>

01:04.040 --> 01:07.647
<i>Our world has never been more</i>

01:08.440 --> 01:09.680
<i>perfect.</i>

01:15.280 --> 01:17.851
<i>Only it is no longer our world.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:26.162
<i>We've been invaded</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:28.322
<i>by an alien race.</i>

01:31.520 --> 01:32.851
<i>They occupy the bodies</i>

01:32.920 --> 01:36.049
<i>of almost all human
beings on the planet.</i>

01:40.320 --> 01:42.971
<i>The few humans
who have survived</i>

01:43.920 --> 01:45.524
<i>are on the run.</i>

02:02.040 --> 02:03.565
Please.

02:03.640 --> 02:04.766
Come with us.

02:04.840 --> 02:05.840
We only want to help you.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.041
Please be careful.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.360
Please don't hurt yourself.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.686
We don't want to hurt you.

02:10.600 --> 02:11.840
Like hell!

02:11.920 --> 02:12.921
No!

02:23.680 --> 02:25.091
No!

03:10.640 --> 03:14.406
Barely a bone not broken
or organ ruptured.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.561
I cannot tell you
why she is not dead.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.207
This one wants to live.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.126
Welcome.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.403
I am Healer Fords.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.489
What shall I call you?

05:28.560 --> 05:32.690
You have lived many lives
on many worlds.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.888
A wanderer such as yourself,

05:34.960 --> 05:36.450
there must have been a name.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.924
Call

05:46.280 --> 05:47.770
me

05:49.320 --> 05:51.004
Wanderer.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.725
When will she be able to work?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.291
Not now.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.242
Of course, Healer.

06:48.720 --> 06:49.846
<i>No.</i>

06:50.040 --> 06:51.166
<i>No.</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:52.481
<i>No.</i>

06:52.840 --> 06:54.683
<i>I didn't die.</i>

06:55.160 --> 06:56.810
<i>I didn't die.</i>

06:58.840 --> 07:00.126
<i>That's right.</i>

07:00.320 --> 07:01.731
<i>I'm still here.</i>

07:02.640 --> 07:04.642
<i>Don't think this is yours.</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:07.048
<i>This body is mine.</i>

07:09.360 --> 07:11.681
No, mine.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.369
<i>I don't know how much
you know about this new world.</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:19.090
<i>Almost every human</i>

07:19.800 --> 07:22.041
has been successfully occupied.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.727
As with the other planets
you've inhabited,

07:25.840 --> 07:28.161
we do not change this world.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.526
But experience it.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.281
And perfect it.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.805
<i>What did you think?</i>

07:32.880 --> 07:34.211
<i>Did you think I'd just give up?</i>

07:34.280 --> 07:37.966
However, there are still
pockets of human resistance

07:38.040 --> 07:39.405
that threaten our peace.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.367
Your host was part
of that resistance.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.609
You want me to
locate her memories.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.729
Yes. From those memories,
we can locate other rebels.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.165
<i>Good luck With that.</i>

07:49.280 --> 07:50.520
But I must warn you.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.765
Most humans fade away, but a
rare few fight their occupation.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.927
Her name is Melanie Stryder.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.761
<i>She was born in Louisiana.</i>

08:13.400 --> 08:16.131
<i>Her family escaped the initial
waves of colonization.</i>

08:20.240 --> 08:22.083
<i>But it was only
a matter of time.</i>

08:32.280 --> 08:34.647
<i>Her father was
discovered alone.</i>

08:38.280 --> 08:41.044
He took his life rather than
be taken by our Seekers

08:41.120 --> 08:42.770
and risk the lives
of his children.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.009
<i>Melanie has been on the run
ever since with...</i>

08:46.120 --> 08:47.929
<i>No! Don't say it!</i>

08:48.000 --> 08:49.001
<i>Don't you say it!</i>

08:51.240 --> 08:52.401
<i>Please.</i>

08:52.480 --> 08:53.811
<i>I beg you.</i>

08:53.880 --> 08:54.881
Is she resisting?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.285
Jamie.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.802
His name is Jamie Stryder.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.490
<i>I hate you.</i>

09:09.120 --> 09:11.327
<i>If only I could hurt you.</i>

09:25.400 --> 09:28.085
I understand why
you are resistant.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.884
You believe that
the loss of your will

09:30.960 --> 09:33.008
is too great a sacrifice.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.209
But we have to think
of the common good.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.445
<i>Call it whatever you want.
This is murder.</i>

09:55.360 --> 09:57.089
One sound and you die.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.407
Do it. I'd rather die.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.845
That's impossible.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.530
You're human.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.251
<i>Come back!</i>

10:21.520 --> 10:22.521
<i>Stop!</i>

10:22.640 --> 10:23.641
Stop!

10:24.080 --> 10:25.570
Wait!

10:29.840 --> 10:32.446
Look! Look! Look at me!

10:32.520 --> 10:33.851
I'm human.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.721
Just like you.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.161
Get off me.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.850
I'm sorry.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.330
<i>My name is Jared Howe.</i>

10:43.800 --> 10:44.881
<i>I didn't mean to scare you.</i>

10:45.920 --> 10:48.366
I haven't spoken to another
human being in two years.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.244
I'm guessing you haven't been
kissed in a while either.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.610
Melanie Stryder.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.603
I've got someone
waiting for me.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.206
You're not alone?

11:10.280 --> 11:11.770
It's my kid brother.

11:12.440 --> 11:15.808
He's hungry. I ran two hours
to get to this house.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.491
I can give you a ride.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.689
Hey, it's faster than running.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.808
It's even faster
than your running.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.407
<i>Are you gonna pretend like
you didn't feel something just now?</i>

11:52.480 --> 11:54.642
<i>I know you felt that.</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:01.651
<i>Stop that!</i>

12:02.120 --> 12:03.770
<i>Stop!</i>

12:14.680 --> 12:17.001
<i>What you're doing is wrong.</i>

12:17.360 --> 12:19.044
<i>And you know it.</i>

12:22.200 --> 12:24.202
After meeting Jared Howe,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.689
Melanie and her brother
stayed with him.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.442
<i>They settled in
an abandoned place</i>

12:32.000 --> 12:34.571
<i>yet to be explored
by our souls.</i>

12:36.960 --> 12:39.691
Left, right.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.202
They could almost forget the
invasion happening around them.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.883
You haven't kissed me
since that first night.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.043
Melanie,

13:09.000 --> 13:10.729
you don't have to.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.402
We could be the last ones.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.402
And even if we are,

13:23.560 --> 13:27.610
the last man and woman
left on Earth,

13:29.400 --> 13:31.721
you still don't have to.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.251
I want to.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.321
When you touch me,

13:43.400 --> 13:44.686
it's...

13:46.720 --> 13:49.087
I don't want you to stop.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.445
You should sleep.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.121
Then sleep with me.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.449
All I'm saying is

14:25.640 --> 14:27.244
we have time.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.163
You don't know that.

14:30.960 --> 14:35.170
You don't know if we've
got months or days.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.282
We could be
taken at any moment.

14:42.120 --> 14:46.125
We only have this, now.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.408
Wanderer? Wanderer?

14:56.880 --> 14:58.484
Wanderer!

15:02.000 --> 15:03.240
Yes, Seeker.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.005
You have not spoken
for several minutes.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.205
They were lovers?

15:17.320 --> 15:22.121
These humans are not like the
other bodies you have inhabited.

15:22.200 --> 15:26.046
They have unusually
strong physical drives.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.365
You have to be vigilant.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.525
Yes.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.082
<i>They saw Seekers nearby.</i>

15:36.240 --> 15:38.561
<i>They were not found,
but knew they had to move on.</i>

15:39.840 --> 15:41.080
They were headed...

15:43.040 --> 15:44.371
I can't see where.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.926
A safe place with others.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.047
Hope...

15:57.160 --> 15:58.810
Before the long journey,

15:58.880 --> 16:01.565
they spent the night in an old
hotel they thought was safe.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.171
<i>Jared was out searching for
supplies for the trip.</i>

16:06.440 --> 16:08.568
Come on. Come on. Come on.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.649
Stay here. Don't move.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.767
I want to go with you.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.922
I'll lead them away
and come right back.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.803
I promise. Come on.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.640
No!

16:40.640 --> 16:42.085
<i>Now you know.</i>

16:42.760 --> 16:44.762
<i>I will do anything.</i>

16:45.720 --> 16:47.006
Go on.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.326
There's nothing more now.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.731
There has to be more.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.404
I will keep trying.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.724
Please do, Wanderer.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.285
<i>No! No, no! Wait! Stop!</i>

17:12.800 --> 17:15.565
<i>You were not meant to see that.
You can't know that!</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:16.681
<i>That could kill them!</i>

17:17.400 --> 17:20.722
<i>Get rid of it. Get rid of it!
Now! Please!</i>

17:20.800 --> 17:22.325
<i>You were not meant to see that.</i>
Quiet.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.050
Quiet.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.122
<i>Wanderer, please.</i>

17:49.000 --> 17:51.207
<i>After everything you've seen,</i>

17:52.120 --> 17:54.487
<i>how can you still help them?</i>

18:35.200 --> 18:36.611
<i>Surprise, surprise.</i>

18:36.680 --> 18:38.364
<i>Look who's here.</i>

18:48.680 --> 18:50.682
What a pleasant
surprise, Seeker.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.570
Did you follow me?

18:53.280 --> 18:55.089
Only in case you needed me.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.605
<i>Yeah. Right.</i>

18:56.680 --> 18:58.011
<i>She is so full of it.</i>

19:00.280 --> 19:02.282
What are you doing here?

19:03.440 --> 19:06.205
I thought a change
of scenery might help.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.605
Change.

19:09.520 --> 19:13.047
Wasn't your last planet
completely covered by water?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.731
It's been a week since
you've had new information.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.489
Do you know where they are?

19:25.160 --> 19:27.686
<i>If you can't
say no, say nothing.</i>

19:28.120 --> 19:29.804
<i>Walk away.</i>

19:39.360 --> 19:41.567
Do you pity them?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.165
The humans?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.885
Don't you?

19:46.600 --> 19:50.002
In your other lives, have you
ever felt anything like this?

19:50.720 --> 19:52.245
They were brutal.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.403
Killing each other.
Killing their planet.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.004
They're lucky they survived
as long as they did.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.291
I do have some good news.

20:03.840 --> 20:07.003
Your identification
of Jared Howe has helped.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.562
There was a sighting. I am
confident we will find him.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.766
- No!
<i>- No!</i>

20:12.920 --> 20:13.921
Ah!

20:33.520 --> 20:36.126
Seeker, I am so sorry.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.529
I don't know what I was doing.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.409
Perhaps because
you weren't doing it.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.720
We have put you through enough.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.723
Your host appears
too resistant.

20:43.800 --> 20:47.202
You are going to be re-implanted
into a more compliant host.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.282
<i>Is he saying
what I think he's saying?</i>

20:49.360 --> 20:50.885
What will happen to this body?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.566
It is time for someone else
to search her memories.

20:54.440 --> 20:55.646
<i>Her?</i>

20:56.960 --> 20:58.200
You?

20:58.280 --> 20:59.520
Yes.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.450
My body can be held for me.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.603
I will return to it when we
have the information we need.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.766
Then what will happen
to Melanie Stryder?

21:07.840 --> 21:10.411
She will have the death
she originally desired.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.964
Unlike the way humans kill,
it will be done humanely.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.965
<i>Stop her! Do something!</i>

21:17.760 --> 21:19.489
My Healer has agreed to this?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.765
No. He transferred
to Fort Worth.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.882
Don't feel bad.
You are not the only one.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.285
There are others who have not
had the strength of will.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.844
When? We make the
transfer tomorrow.

21:37.520 --> 21:39.363
We will stay outside
your door tonight

21:39.440 --> 21:41.249
so no harm will come to you.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.771
Or to others.

21:44.360 --> 21:48.445
<i>Please. I don't care if I die.
I can't have her inside me.</i>

21:48.680 --> 21:50.364
Melanie, I have to do my duty.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.569
<i>You have to do what's right.
She'll kill my family.</i>

21:53.880 --> 21:57.930
<i>Jamie, Jared, she'll kill them.
Wanderer, please.</i>

21:58.240 --> 22:00.288
<i>Your Healer.
Do you think he would help?</i>

22:00.360 --> 22:02.886
I think so. But I don't
know how to reach him.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.770
<i>We need to find him.
We have to get out of here.</i>

22:06.520 --> 22:07.567
We?

22:08.120 --> 22:09.326
<i>Yes!</i>

22:09.400 --> 22:10.925
<i>Put the chair against the door.</i>

22:14.840 --> 22:16.842
<i>No. The other way.</i>

22:22.280 --> 22:24.203
How does this help?
There's no way out.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.527
<i>Yes, there is. That way.</i>

22:28.720 --> 22:30.722
<i>Do it, Wanderer. Move.</i>

22:35.400 --> 22:37.050
<i>Open it.</i>

22:42.400 --> 22:44.641
<i>Come on.
You can do this.</i>

22:47.760 --> 22:50.843
<i>It's not so high.
This is nothing.</i>

22:54.760 --> 22:56.569
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

22:57.520 --> 22:58.567
<i>Climb up.</i>

23:03.400 --> 23:04.640
<i>Now jump.</i>

23:04.720 --> 23:06.210
I can't.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.970
<i>It's a good thing I can.</i>

23:15.760 --> 23:17.330
<i>Swim!</i>

23:21.440 --> 23:23.090
Wanderer?
Are you all right?

23:23.320 --> 23:25.641
You could have killed us.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.085
<i>Run!</i>

23:27.800 --> 23:29.450
Step aside.

23:42.800 --> 23:43.847
Wanderer?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.445
I'm sorry.

23:54.880 --> 23:56.484
<i>We need to steal a car.</i>

23:56.800 --> 23:58.723
<i>Don't worry.
I've done it before.</i>

23:58.960 --> 24:00.325
Let me handle this.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.370
<i>You?
What are you doing? Wait!</i>

24:03.520 --> 24:05.522
Shh! Quiet!

24:09.240 --> 24:10.844
Do you need help?

24:11.360 --> 24:13.124
May I borrow your vehicle?

24:13.880 --> 24:15.325
Please. it is important.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.251
Certainly.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.881
Can I be of assistance?

24:20.040 --> 24:21.485
No. Thank you.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.042
This is an extremely
reliable model.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.128
The tank is full.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.321
<i>Huh!</i>

24:35.400 --> 24:36.640
<i>That's a good trick.</i>

24:36.720 --> 24:40.520
It was no trick. We do not lie.
We trust each other.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.967
<i>You guys take
the fun out of everything.</i>

24:43.600 --> 24:45.170
<i>Where are we going?</i>

24:47.200 --> 24:49.646
I will take you to my
Healer in Fort Worth.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.610
<i>Even if your Healer agrees
to keep me inside you,</i>

24:52.720 --> 24:54.324
<i>I'll still be a prisoner.</i>

24:54.400 --> 24:56.084
You will still be alive.

24:56.160 --> 24:57.685
So will the people you love.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.922
<i>That Seeker is a lot of
things, but she's not a fool.</i>

25:00.000 --> 25:02.685
<i>Sooner or later, she'll work
out where you're going.</i>

25:02.760 --> 25:04.046
We need a map.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.246
<i>I'll show you the way.</i>

26:29.240 --> 26:30.605
<i>What's wrong?</i>

26:30.920 --> 26:32.922
<i>Are the memories too painful?</i>

26:33.960 --> 26:35.769
<i>How do you think I feel?</i>

26:35.840 --> 26:37.171
I know how you feel.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.445
That's the problem.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.206
<i>When you take the body,
the feelings come with it.</i>

26:42.280 --> 26:43.645
<i>It's a package deal.</i>

26:47.400 --> 26:48.561
Where are we?

26:48.640 --> 26:51.166
<i>You tell me. You're the one
with the steering wheel.</i>

26:52.520 --> 26:54.284
You sent us
in the wrong direction.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.769
You have been putting thoughts
in my head to distract me.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.167
The Seeker was right. You are
an unreasonable species.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.165
I try to help you and
this is how you thank me.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.924
We are going to Fort Worth.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.201
<i>No!</i>

28:02.400 --> 28:03.970
Will it still work?

28:04.520 --> 28:06.249
<i>Not anymore.</i>

28:12.040 --> 28:13.530
Now what do we do?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.011
<i>We walk.</i>

28:15.080 --> 28:17.447
Which way?
<i>You can go my way,</i>

28:17.520 --> 28:20.330
<i>or you can go your own
way and kill us both.</i>

28:23.280 --> 28:24.520
You planned this.

28:24.640 --> 28:28.406
<i>I made a promise. I promised
my brother I'd come back.</i>

28:28.760 --> 28:31.240
How could I have
been so foolish?

28:32.480 --> 28:33.601
I can never trust you again.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.404
<i>How do I know I can trust you?</i>

28:35.480 --> 28:37.608
<i>I'm giving you
exactly what you wanted.</i>

28:37.680 --> 28:39.762
<i>Taking you to my family
could get them killed.</i>

28:41.280 --> 28:42.725
<i>We head east.</i>

28:43.480 --> 28:44.970
<i>Come on.</i>

28:51.800 --> 28:53.165
<i>Don't leave tracks.</i>

28:53.520 --> 28:55.045
<i>Walk on the rocks.</i>

29:36.360 --> 29:39.045
Did you really think
you could beat me?

29:49.000 --> 29:50.286
<i>Save the water.</i>

29:50.360 --> 29:51.725
<i>We're gonna need it.</i>

29:52.080 --> 29:53.844
I need it now.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.769
We've been walking for ages.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.047
How do you think
you're going to find them?

30:05.120 --> 30:07.726
<i>My uncle had a cabin
out here in the desert.</i>

30:08.440 --> 30:10.761
<i>We were heading
out here to join him.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:13.762
<i>If he survived.</i>

30:16.240 --> 30:17.844
<i>It's farther than I thought.</i>

30:18.160 --> 30:20.811
I don't know how much
farther I can go.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.804
<i>We've walked too far
to walk back.</i>

31:13.920 --> 31:15.570
Melanie.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.649
Come on, girl.

31:25.720 --> 31:26.801
Stay with me.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.245
Uncle Jeb.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.325
You found us.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.365
Us?

31:43.720 --> 31:48.089
Jamie? Jared? Are they here?
Are they safe?

31:52.920 --> 31:54.684
I told you I saw one.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.724
Why did you give it water?

32:00.000 --> 32:02.002
On account of it was dying.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.600
<i>Uncle Jeb!
I'm in here!</i>

32:06.680 --> 32:07.681
Hold it, Kyle.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.570
Why?

32:10.640 --> 32:11.641
She's one of them.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.802
Well, yeah, she surely is,

32:15.160 --> 32:16.241
but she's also my niece.

32:16.720 --> 32:17.926
Was.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.441
I'm just saying
it's complicated, Ian.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.726
I can make it simple.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.961
Yeah, me, too.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.445
<i>Aunt Maggie!</i>

32:27.520 --> 32:28.521
Aunt Maggie!

32:30.960 --> 32:34.043
You don't fool us, parasite!

32:34.360 --> 32:37.284
<i>Oh, God. They don't see me.
They only see you.</i>

32:37.760 --> 32:38.841
Now, Maggie.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.400
Don't you "Maggie" me,
little brother.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.727
It could bring a whole
army down on our heads.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.242
I don't see anyone.

32:50.720 --> 32:53.121
<i>I'm in here.</i>

32:53.240 --> 32:54.730
This is unkind, Jebediah.

32:55.160 --> 32:56.446
Let's go.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.122
Life is unkind, Magnolia.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.411
Watch your head.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.483
<i>Where are we, Wanderer?</i>

33:33.800 --> 33:36.451
I reckon it's safe enough now.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.522
<i>So many humans alive.</i>

34:16.000 --> 34:17.286
<i>We haven't lost.</i>

34:23.159 --> 34:24.161
<i>Jared!</i>

34:24.560 --> 34:26.641
Jared!
<i>Jared's alive! Jared's...</i>

34:29.280 --> 34:30.770
Enough, Jared.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.360
Jebediah,

34:32.760 --> 34:34.284
I know it's hard.

34:34.360 --> 34:36.931
But we gotta do
what's best for everyone.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.446
She's gotta go to Doc's place.
Just like the rest.

34:39.520 --> 34:41.010
Ain't that right, Doc?

34:43.120 --> 34:44.201
No!

34:44.280 --> 34:45.360
<i>Jamie!</i>

35:28.560 --> 35:30.050
I don't see any tracks.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.091
She didn't fly away.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.049
This Wanderer is
living up to her name.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.964
We find her,
we find the resistance.

36:01.520 --> 36:03.170
Melanie?

36:06.760 --> 36:07.966
<i>Wanderer?</i>

36:08.440 --> 36:11.284
<i>They don't know a human can
stay alive in a body.</i>

36:13.120 --> 36:14.963
<i>You can't tell them
I'm in here.</i>

36:15.280 --> 36:16.770
<i>They won't believe you.</i>

36:17.240 --> 36:19.811
<i>They'll think you're
lying to save yourself.</i>

36:21.800 --> 36:23.086
<i>Oh, God.</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:25.050
<i>They're gonna kill us.</i>

36:28.560 --> 36:29.766
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

37:03.640 --> 37:05.722
Move aside, Jared.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.084
Get out of the way.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.721
We can't keep her
prisoner forever.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.600
It's gonna escape
and lead them to us.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.088
I don't want to
hurt you, Jared.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.765
But I Will.

37:31.080 --> 37:33.162
No!
I am what you want!

37:33.240 --> 37:34.685
Stay back!

37:34.760 --> 37:36.171
I am what you want!

37:36.240 --> 37:37.571
Ian! Get it!

37:38.000 --> 37:39.047
Leave him alone!

37:42.280 --> 37:45.921
<i>Keep breathing! Come on, Wanderer!
Fight him! Fight!</i>

37:46.520 --> 37:47.521
Finish it!

37:57.160 --> 37:58.730
Good evening, everyone.

37:59.320 --> 38:03.166
I hate to remind you, but this is
my place, and you are my guests.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.890
For the moment, she is, too.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.803
I don't take kindly to my
guests strangling each other.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.848
Jeb, it's got to die.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.600
We took a vote.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.848
This ain't a democracy.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.844
It's a dictatorship.

38:19.720 --> 38:23.122
It's a benign dictatorship, but
it's a dictatorship just the same.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.200
You mind telling us what
you plan on doing with it?

38:25.920 --> 38:27.410
This ain't never
happened before.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.922
One of our own coming back.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.290
For right now,
this tunnel is off limits.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.763
If I find any of you back here,
I'm asking questions second.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.281
I'll take
the next watch, Jared.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.246
Keep it away from the kid.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.881
I do not think
we are looking for Wanderer.

38:59.640 --> 39:01.642
I think we are
looking for a body.

39:01.720 --> 39:03.529
Even if she were
not hurt in the wreck,

39:03.600 --> 39:05.762
how long could she
survive in this place?

39:05.840 --> 39:08.605
From my experience, this
host has difficulty dying.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.770
There's too much
land for us to cover.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.888
I am requesting more Seekers,

39:12.960 --> 39:14.769
ground and air patrols.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.446
Are they really such a threat?

39:16.880 --> 39:19.281
We outnumber them
a million to one.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.324
He's still pissed you hit him.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.285
I told him you were sorry.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.370
I'm not.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.005
I know.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.526
No one's ever sorry
for hitting my brother.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.766
It looks like they're
calling off the search.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.404
Not that one.

40:19.600 --> 40:20.761
<i>Jamie!</i>

40:20.840 --> 40:22.285
<i>Little brother.</i>

40:34.920 --> 40:36.206
Do you know who I am?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.604
You are Jamie.

40:39.680 --> 40:40.806
But you're not Melanie.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.771
I want to know what happened
to my sister that night.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.122
She said that she
was gonna come back.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.440
<i>If he can't know I'm alive,</i>

40:50.520 --> 40:52.727
<i>he deserves to know
what happened to me.</i>

40:54.080 --> 40:55.730
I'm not a kid.

40:56.240 --> 40:57.605
Please.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.686
To protect you and Jared,
she tried to take her life.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.488
Our healers mended her
and put me in her

41:07.560 --> 41:10.484
hoping I could find out if there
were other human survivors.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.526
Do you have a name?

41:15.880 --> 41:17.564
They call me Wanderer.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.520
Where do you come from?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.605
Another planet.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.961
What the hell?
Damn it, Jeb, I told you.

41:24.040 --> 41:25.087
To keep her away from the kid.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.049
You never said nothing about
keeping the kid away from her.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.930
Jamie, that is not Melanie!
She's never coming back.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.440
It's still her body
that we've hurt.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.681
Get out of here now, Jamie,

41:32.800 --> 41:34.086
or so help me, I'll...
Jared.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.847
I'll look after Jamie.

41:39.920 --> 41:40.967
We'll watch it.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.250
I don't trust it.

41:49.640 --> 41:50.846
Could be another Seeker.

41:50.920 --> 41:51.967
She...
It

41:52.040 --> 41:54.725
is the furthest thing from
a Seeker I've ever seen.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.843
I mean, she jumped between you and Kyle.
They don't do that.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.446
It was trying to find a way
to stay alive and escape.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.727
What, by giving Kyle the
go-ahead to kill her? It?

42:02.800 --> 42:03.847
That's a good plan.

42:03.920 --> 42:06.446
What the hell has
gotten into everybody?

42:07.280 --> 42:10.204
It is the enemy.
Don't forget it.

42:10.840 --> 42:13.320
You don't feel bad at all.
I mean, I half killed her.

42:13.440 --> 42:17.604
It doesn't matter.
It's not human.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.441
So we stop acting human?

42:37.400 --> 42:39.562
This is a big planet.

42:44.440 --> 42:45.441
Yes.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.841
<i>There has been a sighting of
humans in your area.</i>

42:47.960 --> 42:51.203
<i>We are commencing a full-scale
search immediately.</i>

42:54.520 --> 42:55.681
Something, ain't it?

42:57.640 --> 42:59.847
Found this place by accident.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.684
Really, it found me.

43:01.760 --> 43:03.410
I fell through the roof.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.169
Almost died trying to find
a way out of these caves.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.844
There's only one.

43:10.240 --> 43:13.244
No one's found it on
their own since I did.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.124
Kept the place to myself.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.124
Good thing, too. Without
this, we're all dead. Right?

43:18.240 --> 43:20.004
Wanderer?

43:23.120 --> 43:25.407
Sound travels in these caves.

43:26.360 --> 43:29.364
Your name is a mouthful.
You mind if I shorten it?

43:30.200 --> 43:33.044
Life's short.
Especially right now.

43:33.880 --> 43:36.201
Mind if I call you...

43:38.120 --> 43:39.770
Wanda?

43:48.200 --> 43:54.287
We get our power from the sun, Earth.
Any place we can.

43:54.960 --> 43:59.249
It's actually an extinct
volcano not quite extinct.

44:04.880 --> 44:06.086
Watch yourself.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.682
Fall in,
you're not coming back.

44:23.240 --> 44:25.242
Afternoon, everyone.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.762
It's all yours.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.564
Don't you all look pretty?

44:34.640 --> 44:36.165
You all got your shades?

44:36.240 --> 44:37.685
Yeah, yeah.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.649
Make sure you wear them.

44:39.720 --> 44:41.449
You already look like an alien.

45:27.680 --> 45:29.640
Makes you feel like a human
being again, don't it?

45:33.080 --> 45:34.320
Bad joke?

45:55.320 --> 45:57.482
You have the resources
you wanted, Seeker.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.081
I know you must
have seen a lot,

46:08.200 --> 46:10.362
but you ain't seen
nothing like this.

46:26.120 --> 46:27.724
Nothing.

46:28.920 --> 46:29.921
How?

46:30.000 --> 46:32.810
Same way the magicians do it.
Mirrors.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.202
<i>And they all said
Jeb was crazy.</i>

46:45.200 --> 46:48.329
<i>How many crazy people
could pull this off?</i>

46:50.600 --> 46:52.602
It's almost ready to harvest.

46:53.720 --> 46:56.405
Can't come too soon.
We sure need the grain.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.722
Everyone here thinks you're going
to betray us to the Seekers.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.924
Makes sense.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.931
Why else would you be here?

47:13.240 --> 47:16.687
What I can't wrap my head around
is what kind of a plan was that?

47:17.080 --> 47:18.684
Walking into the desert
with no backup

47:18.760 --> 47:20.683
and no way
to get yourself back?

47:21.240 --> 47:23.481
So if, like you say, you weren't
coming here for the Seekers,

47:23.560 --> 47:24.846
why were you doing it?

47:24.920 --> 47:28.561
Then I started thinking, when
they put one of you in our heads,

47:28.640 --> 47:31.325
do we still exist?
Trapped in there?

47:32.080 --> 47:34.765
If our memories are
still alive, are we?

47:35.760 --> 47:38.331
You gotta believe some people
wouldn't go down without a fight.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.080
Hell, I know
I wouldn't go quiet.

47:40.120 --> 47:42.566
And I've never seen
fight like in Mel.

47:42.640 --> 47:46.804
What she'd fight for, more than
anything, is the people that she loves.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.964
I wonder

47:53.320 --> 47:56.881
if a love like that might
play on someone's mind.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.005
Heart.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.361
It might get somebody to do something
they wouldn't ordinarily do.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.126
Maybe you're here

48:07.640 --> 48:11.281
'cause you do actually care
about Jared and the kid.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.481
You.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.129
Wanda.

48:21.480 --> 48:23.164
He sees everything.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.128
He's not crazy.
He's a genius.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.850
<i>I think he's both.</i>

48:28.200 --> 48:30.248
Yeah, I wonder

48:31.240 --> 48:34.164
a lot about a lot of things.

48:35.600 --> 48:37.682
And I'm not the only one.

48:39.080 --> 48:41.321
Care to join us, Jamie?

48:48.520 --> 48:49.851
Uncle Jeb.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.849
How did you know I was here?

48:54.640 --> 48:56.005
Mirrors.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.004
Mirrors! Mirrors!

49:20.720 --> 49:22.051
Help him!

49:36.720 --> 49:37.721
<i>I saw something!</i>

49:37.880 --> 49:38.961
Now, come on!

49:39.080 --> 49:40.491
Help!

49:53.280 --> 49:54.770
<i>I saw evidence of humans.</i>

50:03.680 --> 50:05.364
<i>I see evidence of us.</i>

50:07.240 --> 50:08.810
<i>There's nothing here.</i>

50:15.000 --> 50:16.365
Thank you.

50:16.960 --> 50:18.041
They're gone.

50:18.600 --> 50:19.761
They're gone for now.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.361
Jared and the others
are still out there.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.769
Jamie, why don't you take
over guard duty for a spell?

50:34.280 --> 50:35.611
What do I do?

50:36.040 --> 50:38.441
You just keep an eye on her.
You'll figure it out.

50:40.680 --> 50:41.966
This way.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.804
You can't give
a boy a loaded gun.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.128
That's why I didn't.

51:13.560 --> 51:15.562
<i>Where is he taking us?</i>

51:16.880 --> 51:18.882
Aren't you
taking me to my cell?

51:21.720 --> 51:23.370
I miss the outdoors.

51:24.800 --> 51:27.240
And I was thinking that maybe
you're starting to miss it, too.

51:31.080 --> 51:32.844
Be real quiet.

51:38.880 --> 51:40.689
Okay. Sit here.

51:48.520 --> 51:50.284
You can open your eyes now.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.202
What stars are these?

52:00.800 --> 52:03.201
I've never seen
this constellation.

52:04.880 --> 52:06.564
They're not stars.

52:07.080 --> 52:08.605
They're glowworms.

52:09.040 --> 52:12.965
You have to be quiet or they
get scared and stop shining.

52:25.920 --> 52:28.287
When I miss the sky,
I come here.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.164
It's beautiful.

52:35.640 --> 52:36.971
Wanda?

52:39.840 --> 52:42.241
I heard what
Uncle Jeb was saying.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.930
He thinks that Melanie
might still be alive.

52:46.600 --> 52:48.011
Inside there with you, I mean.

52:48.080 --> 52:49.605
<i>Jamie!</i>

52:51.560 --> 52:53.608
Can that happen?

52:54.400 --> 52:56.209
Does it, Wanda?

52:57.920 --> 52:59.604
Why won't you answer me?

53:00.640 --> 53:02.927
Is Melanie still alive?

53:05.280 --> 53:06.770
Wanda, please.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.203
<i>Forget what I said.</i>

53:10.280 --> 53:11.770
<i>Tell him.</i>

53:20.160 --> 53:22.208
She promised she
would come back.

53:24.520 --> 53:25.806
Yes.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.962
Has Melanie ever
broken a promise to you?

53:45.200 --> 53:46.611
I love you, Mel.

53:46.680 --> 53:48.409
She loves you, too.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.643
She's so happy you're safe.

53:56.480 --> 53:59.689
Is everybody like that?
Does everybody stay?

54:00.320 --> 54:01.651
No.

54:02.680 --> 54:04.728
Not like Melanie.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.204
She's special.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.604
She's very strong.

54:10.680 --> 54:13.365
She wanted to keep her promise.

54:14.240 --> 54:16.561
She couldn't have
kept her promise

54:17.280 --> 54:19.886
if you didn't help her keep it.

54:22.520 --> 54:24.488
Thank you, Wanda.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.002
It's our secret.
Okay?

54:50.080 --> 54:51.684
Good evening, sir.

54:53.200 --> 54:54.247
Can I help you?

54:57.760 --> 54:59.762
I think you can.

55:01.040 --> 55:02.041
Come on, hurry.

55:11.280 --> 55:13.328
You guys all right?
Yeah.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.244
No racing.
Yeah, sure.

55:36.240 --> 55:37.969
It's ready.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.887
I figured it's time
you started earning your keep.

55:44.800 --> 55:47.531
I'll see you both
in the east field.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.450
Morning, Jamie.

56:08.800 --> 56:10.450
Wanda.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.691
Come on.

56:34.360 --> 56:35.441
Wanda?

56:36.920 --> 56:38.160
Yeah.

56:39.640 --> 56:40.846
Wanda.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.844
<i>Why is he looking at you?</i>

57:13.720 --> 57:16.007
<i>Why are you looking at him?</i>

57:33.360 --> 57:35.362
<i>Don't forget.
He tried to kill you.</i>

57:38.960 --> 57:42.089
<i>Did you hear me?
He tried to kill you.</i>

57:46.560 --> 57:48.483
<i>Don't you dare smile at him.</i>

58:18.960 --> 58:20.769
You better take care of that.

58:30.640 --> 58:33.962
There. That one drives
faster than the limit.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.842
<i>Please stop your
vehicle and safely exit.</i>

58:44.920 --> 58:46.331
Fire!

58:53.120 --> 58:54.201
It ain't doing any good.

58:54.280 --> 58:56.044
I don't care! Keep firing!

59:32.320 --> 59:34.163
Don't get caught.

59:35.680 --> 59:36.920
Take him out!

59:50.120 --> 59:52.566
<i>Please stop your
vehicle and safely exit.</i>

59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.011
<i>Switch off your engine
and safely exit.</i>

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.605
There are others.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.764
I always liked
science fiction stories.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.127
Never dreamed
I'd be living in one.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.850
How many planets have life?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.288
<i>Just remember, Wanda,
you're not one of them.</i>

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.850
Twelve that we know of.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.568
Four I've never been to.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.529
We've just
opened up a new world.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.886
You've conquered 12 planets?

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.090
That's not how we see it.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.130
We have always lived by
bonding with another species.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.965
It is how we survive.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.442
We try to live in harmony.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.325
Speed up! Lose it!

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.369
No! Let him catch us.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.966
Let's go!
We've got enough!

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.445
Let's go!

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.369
We almost had them.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.445
Seeker.
This is not who we are.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.280
You have killed a soul.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.682
We have to make sacrifices.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.766
This is a war.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.562
This war is over.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.767
The last of the resistance
will die out on its own.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.804
They will become extinct.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:32.804
But I think there is a war
raging in you, Seeker.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.801
We're going home.
So are you.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.446
You don't know what's going on.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.921
We are losing control.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.521
<i>Wanda.</i>

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.651
If you don't mind me
asking, how old are you?

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.925
Over a thousand of your years.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.971
I have not completed one
full revolution of your sun,

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.965
yet I have found that
Earth is more beautiful

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.607
and harder than
any place I have ever been.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.684
I've gotta say, this is the
most interesting conversation

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.489
- I've had in forever.
- What is this?

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.044
This has gone on long enough!

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.531
Out of the way!

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.045
- She's not a threat.
- No?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.647
Aaron and Brandt are dead

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.808
thanks to the Seeker
looking for it.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.130
Almost got us, too.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.849
I'm gonna end this
once and for all!

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:39.967
Jared!

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.481
You can't!

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.641
Why not?

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.042
Because if you kill Wanda...

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.610
<i>MELANIE> Oh, no, Jamie!</i>

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.288
...you'll kill Melanie.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.565
She's still alive in there.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.850
I beleve it.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.444
You're all letting it fool you!

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.808
Come on, Jamie.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.761
I'm so sorry.
I'll go back to my cell.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.605
No.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.169
This'll blow over.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.529
You can stay in my place.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.124
She'll be safe there.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.400
Mmm.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:50.203
You tried to kill me
and now you're protecting me?

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.442
Strange world, isn't it?

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.769
The strangest.

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.720
What's wrong with you, Doc?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.569
You want to try? You try.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.320
Wanda?

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.884
I just want you to know
that I trust you.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.168
And I believe you're
telling us the truth.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.651
But I... I gotta ask.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.041
What's it like for you and
her, living in there together?

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.647
It's crowded.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.083
Let me know
if you need anything.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.322
I'll just be right out here.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.160
<i>I think he likes you too much.</i>

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.129
What is too much?

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.801
<i>If I've got anything to do with
it, you'll never find out.</i>

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.647
I know it's with you.

01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:32.449
Oh, God.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.680
I'm not gonna kill it.

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:36.607
I just want to talk to it.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.811
It's okay.
I will talk to him.

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.168
Her name is Wanda,
not "it."

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.005
I'm so sorry about
what happened out there,

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.084
to your friends.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:08.523
I never meant to hurt anyone.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.561
Wanda,

01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:15.322
Jamie and Jeb believe,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.524
Ian, too,

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.761
that Mel is still
alive and kicking in there.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.365
<i>I am!</i>

01:08:23.439 --> 01:08:24.487
<i>I am!</i>

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:29.930
In fact, Jeb has this crazy notion
that you're here for Jamie and me.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.567
You brought Melanie back to us.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.448
I can't believe it.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.840
I don't want to believe it
because her being in there,

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.171
trapped,

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.087
that makes it
so much worse somehow.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.122
But I gotta know.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.205
Is Melanie in there?

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.121
<i>Whatever happens, happens.</i>

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.567
<i>Just tell him I'm here.
Tell him I love him.</i>

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.121
I'm afraid.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.287
You see, the thing is, Wanda,

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.564
I haven't stopped
dreaming about Melanie.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.569
<i>I dream about you, too.</i>

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.331
I miss everything about her.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.801
And I would do
anything to get her back.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.490
You know what makes
this so much harder?

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.769
It's still her body.

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.042
If it wasn't for those eyes...

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.162
I got to thinking.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.002
If I can't kiss her,

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.805
I can kiss you.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.645
<i>What? No!
What is he doing?</i>

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.250
<i>No! Stop it!</i>

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:40.323
<i>Stop! Now!</i>

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.046
<i>Don't do this!</i>

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.085
<i>No! No!</i>

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.685
I knew it.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.286
Mel.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.001
You're really in there.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:53.885
You hit me for kissing it.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.444
Mel, I love you.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.163
I know you can't say it
back, but I love you.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.840
<i>So now he believes it, too.</i>

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.210
<i>It doesn't help anyone.</i>

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.764
<i>Knowing I'm a prisoner in here
just hurts them more.</i>

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.086
Wanda!

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.567
<i>Hide.</i>

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:25.324
<i>Hide! Hide!</i>

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.324
Wanda.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.202
Wanda!

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.402
<i>Wanda, get out of here!</i>

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.566
<i>Run!</i>

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.205
<i>Run!</i>

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.321
Grab my hand!

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.890
<i>What are you doing? Let go!</i>

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.447
He'll die!

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.648
<i>Good! If he dies,
he can't kill us!</i>

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.405
No!

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.721
Help!

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.686
Help!

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.643
You're lucky your head's harder
than any rock in this place.

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.486
You'll live.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.924
Don't be too sure
about that, Doc.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.127
What happened?

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.967
<i>Tell him.</i>

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:19.841
It was an accident.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:21.081
<i>Like hell!</i>

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:23.089
<i>I thought you didn't lie.</i>

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.400
Kyle slipped.

01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.766
Sure he did.

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.444
If that's what
it says happened...

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.363
Oh, come on.
We all know what happened.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:34.208
He tried to kill her.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.682
And for some unknown reason,
she saved his sorry ass.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.284
If it's true, Kyle, you're out.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.285
Did he try to kill you?

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.211
It's not saying he did.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.326
You're the one who has to
live under the same roof.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.409
Kyle, I'm warning you.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.802
Don't you even
look at her wrong.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.241
I haven't shot anyone in a long time.
Kind of miss the thrill of it.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.803
We gotta get back to work.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.082
Come on, let's go.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.685
Hey, Jeb.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:22.731
We're going back out.

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:24.650
- Too many Seekers out there.
- No.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.768
We lost a lot on that last run.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.128
There are a couple
of things that I need.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.050
Take Kyle with you.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.725
Come on, Kyle.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.930
And, you,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.843
keep away from her.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.362
You want to take a walk?

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.571
Didn't Jared tell you
to stay away from me?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.411
Yeah.

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.088
<i>This is not a good idea.</i>

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.042
You can open your eyes now.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.570
I'm outside!

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.487
That really is the sky.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.250
I like you, Wanda.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.046
I like you, too, Ian.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.690
<i>You did not say that.</i>

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:08.966
No.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.560
Not like that.

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.009
<i>Get his hands off me!</i>

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.761
<i>This can't work.
What are you doing?</i>

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:18.761
Let me guess.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:21.688
You're of two minds about it.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.521
Is this about Jared?

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.840
<i>Yes, it's about Jared.</i>

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:27.849
Melanie is in love with him.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.201
And you?

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.328
<i>Tell him. Tell him!</i>

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.603
This body loves him.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.282
Since it is now my body,

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.960
so do I.

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.249
But I also have
feelings of my own.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.446
<i>No, you don't.</i>

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.925
<i>Wanda, no.</i>

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.971
<i>Stop!</i>

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.122
<i>You are not going there.</i>

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.404
<i>What about Jared?</i>

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.641
This is very complicated.

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.881
Is there any way Melanie
can give us some privacy?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.843
Look the other way a moment?

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.081
Step into the other room?

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.764
<i>You wish.</i>

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.329
I don't think that's
possible right now.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.685
You know,

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.168
it's not really me you like.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.524
It's this body.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.128
You couldn't care for me.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.002
If you could hold me,

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.325
me,

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.250
in your hand,

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.809
you'd be disgusted.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.962
You would crush me.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.643
You don't know that.

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:04.964
<i>Wanda! No!
This is so wrong.</i>

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.088
<i>You're not even
from the same planet!</i>

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:09.891
<i>I'll do something.
I'll hurt him!</i>

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.010
Strange to be in a body
that won't let me use it.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.563
I think you'd
better take me back.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.165
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.644
As you say,

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.847
I'm still of two minds.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.846
Okay.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.842
You're angry when
I kiss a man you do love

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.127
and angry when
I kiss a man you don't.

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:56.009
It's very confusing.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.649
I am not weak.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.046
I am in control.

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:31.281
<i>You will never win.</i>

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.482
Jamie.
Where is everyone?

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:13.841
I don't know.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.329
<i>Why is he lying?
He never lies.</i>

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:21.282
Your leg should be better by now.
You need to see Doc.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.925
I just came from there.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.002
He told me to go and lay down.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.049
I'm going to wash up.
I'll meet you in your room.

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.690
<i>This doesn't make sense.</i>

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:48.443
<i>What is Doc thinking?</i>

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:52.726
<i>What's more important than
getting Jamie better?</i>

01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.327
<i>Hold on.</i>

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.880
<i>Wait.</i>

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:01.440
<i>Wanda, go back. Go back!</i>

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.568
<i>Wanda, don't go in there!</i>

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.688
<i>Turn around. Go back!</i>

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.444
<i>- Oh, God!</i>
- Enough!

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.086
No!

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:37.444
Monsters!

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.846
Wait! Wanda!

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.481
Wanda!

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.244
<i>Wanda! Wanda! Stop!</i>

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.403
Get out of my head! Get out!

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.365
I'm sorry.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.885
You know, there are easier ways to
die than starving yourself to death.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.686
Yes.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.007
I could always visit Doc.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:25.250
What did you expect, Wanda?
You expect us to just give up?

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.044
This is our world.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.365
We haven't just lost a war.
We're dying out.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.768
We're trying to
get our people back.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.690
What you're trying
to do is impossible.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.242
It doesn't work like that.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:49.721
All you are going to do

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.565
is keep murdering
more of both of us.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.847
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.129
I can't stay here.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.810
Not with you slaughtering
my family in the next room.

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.090
If you say our way won't work,

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.524
I'll tell the boys
no more hostages.

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.166
It's probably for the best. I don't
think Doc could take much more.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:07.842
How can I trust you?

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.922
I trusted you.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.090
There's something else.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.968
Melanie? Are you there?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.689
Melanie, where are you? Jamie is hurt.
I need you. Talk to me.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:39.401
Melanie, please come back.
I can't do this without you.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.525
Wanda.

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.443
I want you to know about

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.246
Doc and everything.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.209
Don't worry about that now.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:04.961
We have to get you better.

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.490
You sound like Melanie.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.286
Did Melanie say that just then?

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.365
Yes.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.169
Wanda.
I need you to kiss me.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.921
What about Melanie?
Don't worry about Melanie.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.881
No. Kiss me like
you want to get slapped.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.091
What?
Was she stopping you?

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.482
No. That's the problem.
We're alone. She's gone.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.170
Ever since I told her to get
out of my head, she's...

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.049
I'm afraid I've lost her.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.691
She got so angry
before when you kissed me.

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.603
I thought she'd come back.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.125
Then I guess you'll have to
make her really angry.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.530
Kiss her.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.361
I lost Melanie.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.123
I don't know
if she's still there.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.089
You need to bring her back.
She hates me kissing you.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.531
Okay.

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:22.363
Melanie, come back.

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.282
I will not lose you.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.082
<i>Jared.</i>

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.571
Melanie?

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.968
<i>Oh. Stop!</i>

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.926
Melanie, you bit me!

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.161
<i>Wanda, what the hell?</i>

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:42.765
Melanie,
I'm so glad you're back.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:43.841
<i>Did I leave?</i>

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.126
For three days.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.964
You don't know what I've
been through to find you.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.883
<i>Yeah, you look like
you were suffering.</i>

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:51.440
We have to help Jamie.
He's hurt.

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.085
Come on.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.801
Stop.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:56.927
Stop.

01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.041
Where are you going?

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.202
It's infected. It's got
into Jamie's bloodstream.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.691
He needs medicine.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.162
There's no medicine out there.
You souls have destroyed it all.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.004
He doesn't need your medicine.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:08.128
It's too late for that.
He needs ours.

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.884
You have to take
me out of the cave.

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.405
You'll have to trust me.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.961
Cut me. I need a
wound like Jamie's.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.681
I can't do that.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.807
I'll be healed in minutes.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.808
<i>Take it from him.
Do it yourself.</i>

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:58.170
They'll be suspicious of this scar.
I can cover it with a cut.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.050
It's gonna be okay.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.441
Excuse me.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.487
Goodness.
We have an emergency.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.088
<i>You can do this, Wanda.</i>

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:22.285
I'm Healer Skye.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:24.121
What happened?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.169
<i>Tell her you tripped.</i>

01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.321
<i>Tell her you tripped!</i>

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.811
I tripped.

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.131
<i>With a knife in your hand.</i>

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.881
With a knife in my hand,
cut myself.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.651
You poor thing.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.804
Let's fix you up.

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.011
Heal.

01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.011
Seal.

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:11.526
<i>Send her away.</i>

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.729
If it is no trouble, could
I please have some water?

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:16.245
Of course.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.050
<i>Hurry! Take it!</i>

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:39.727
What do you think?

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:41.441
Perfect.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.646
Thank you.

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.810
Goodbye.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:56.211
<i>What are you doing?
We have to go.</i>

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.166
Is he alive?

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.526
Barely.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.647
What is all that?

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:28.927
Medicine.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.321
Wait! No. No. We don't
know what that'll do.

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:32.481
She knows what she's doing.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.363
We all know what will
happen if we do nothing.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:35.641
He'll die.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.407
Doc.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:38.921
It's okay.

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.725
Please.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.565
Do it.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.562
Doc, do it.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:08.967
That's it.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.408
<i>Come on, Jamie.
Open your eyes.</i>

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.171
<i>Please.</i>

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.643
Jamie.
Hey, buddy.

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.448
You're getting good, Doc.

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.161
<i>I've walked out of plenty
of stores without paying.</i>

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.645
<i>First time anyone's
been happy about it.</i>

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.763
I liked it better
when we were stealing.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:05.729
You spoil everything, Wanda.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.211
No, Wes!

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.327
Hello, Wanderer.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:48.045
Seeker.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.565
Why did you waste
the medicine on me?

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.085
Aren't you going to kill me?

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.929
Can I speak to her alone?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.843
<i>Does that include me?</i>

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.850
<i>I guess it does.</i>

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:29.968
We'll be outside, Wanda.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.284
You just say the word.

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.161
Huh!

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:42.680
Wanda?

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.043
Surely,
you go by "Melanie" now.

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.440
Did you ask to kill me
yourself, Melanie?

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:52.329
What are you waiting for?

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:55.049
I'm not here to kill you.

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:56.641
Oh.

01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:03.402
You're my interrogator.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.045
I do want to know something.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.281
Why?

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.369
Why couldn't you
just let me go?

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:23.442
Because I was right.

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:28.562
I know the threat a weak
soul like you represents.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.811
Unlike you, I am doing my duty.
I am fighting for us.

01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.962
We cannot live with them
like the other worlds.

01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.209
You, more than anyone,
know that.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:42.170
Did you come alone?

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:45.681
Other Seekers will
come looking for me,

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.087
just like I came
looking for you.

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:50.447
No one else is
coming to find you.

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.327
You die, and the
danger dies with you.

01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:58.162
The people here will be safe.

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.002
So you are going to kill me.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.923
<i>Wanda, what is this?
What are you thinking?</i>

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:19.442
<i>Don't put up walls against me.
Talk to me.</i>

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:52.405
Wanda?

01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:57.450
I never got the chance
to say how truly...

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.522
There's a way
to make up for it.

01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:02.007
I know how to do

01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:04.560
what you have been ending
so many lives trying to do.

01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.562
I can take a soul from a body.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:09.244
<i>You can do what?</i>

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.883
<i>What are you saying, Wanda?</i>

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:14.687
I will only
give you this knowledge

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.127
on the condition
you do as I ask

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:20.046
and promise that no harm
will come to any soul.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:22.684
I can promise you that.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:25.650
There's one other thing
you must promise.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.042
And you must promise
to keep it a secret.

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.811
You have to let me die.

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:38.211
<i>No! No! No!</i>

01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.763
I can't do that, Wanda.

01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.769
I... I can't.

01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.960
It's the only way I can
give you what you want.

01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:48.407
<i>Wanda.</i>

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:50.320
<i>No.</i>

01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.201
She's out.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.328
So you don't want us
to kill the Seeker.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.202
She killed Wes.
Who knows how many others?

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.569
She wouldn't blink
about butchering us.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.483
There's been too much killing.

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:17.768
Not death. Exile.

01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.648
You want us to forgive her.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.450
And let them go,
just like that?

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.726
Yes.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.529
We souls can leave
the same way we arrived.

01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.170
I will send her away.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.047
By the time she reaches
another planet,

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:52.363
your grandchildren
will have died of old age.

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.646
You have always tried
to extract it by force.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:28.369
The secret is,
you do not remove it,

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:30.525
it removes itself.

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.563
You coax it out.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.490
You have always seen it as the enemy.
It can feel the hate.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:45.650
It can only be
captured by kindness.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.965
Love.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.602
Ian, help me.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.125
Thank you.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.489
What is your name?

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.246
I'm Lacey.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.207
My name is Lacey.

01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:17.847
I've been
screaming inside for years.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:19.606
Nobody could hear me.

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.930
You're the reason why she
wouldn't leave me alone.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.446
Yes, she wasn't
just after humans.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.480
She was hoping to find
a way to fight the hosts.

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.571
Like me.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.046
And you, Melanie.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:37.608
Who fight back.

01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:07.324
Have a safe trip.

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:09.890
<i>And along one.</i>

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:20.000
<i>Always send the souls
to the most distant planets.</i>

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.205
Wanda?

01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:28.723
Do you miss it out there?

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.085
The other worlds?

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.408
I miss many things.

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.405
Don't you miss Melanie?

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.321
Don't you want
your sister back?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.002
She's here now.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.241
<i>You know he's right.</i>

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:53.400
Not the way she needs to be.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:42:58.447
I think...

01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:01.330
I think it's time to move on.

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:02.970
Leave us?

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.720
Yes.

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.767
But you can always
come back, right?

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.845
I asked you here
so no one would shout.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.725
<i>I wish I could shout loud
enough for them to hear.</i>

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.131
As soon as I knew
what to do with the Seeker,

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:42.404
I knew there was a way for all of
you to get your loved ones back.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.209
Without hurting the souls.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.450
But, of course,

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.968
I knew I had to give
Melanie back to herself.

01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:57.360
And leave.

01:43:57.440 --> 01:43:59.647
That can't happen, Wanda.
We need you.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.731
Us or you?

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.282
<i>Tell them the truth.
You're not leaving this world.</i>

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.888
<i>Tell them what
you're really gonna do.</i>

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.722
Now that you
have this knowledge

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.802
of how to extract
a soul from a body,

01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.245
you can survive without me.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.401
And what does Mel say?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.809
She's always
wanted her life back.

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:18.961
<i>Don't speak for me.</i>

01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.642
You're lying.

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:25.049
I have to go.

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.487
You don't have to
decide right now.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:35.968
Think about it.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.723
Promise me
you'll think about it.

01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:05.449
You are not leaving me.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:06.931
I can't stay.

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.566
But I love you.

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.685
I love you.

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:22.370
Don't say it like
you're saying goodbye.

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:30.651
I love you in
every way that I can.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.089
And I'll miss you the most.

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.604
I miss the future
I might have had with you.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.411
You're willing
to sacrifice that?

01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.162
Sometimes we have
to make sacrifices.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.245
No, I can't let you go. I won't.
Let me talk to Melanie.

01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:48.850
She's not there right now.

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.804
She stepped into the other
room, so I can kiss you.

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.001
I really can't
talk you out of it?

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:58.530
No. It's time.

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:02.042
I want to die.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.163
If you had lived a millennium

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:08.642
always in the body of another, you
might feel the same way yourself.

01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:17.720
<i>Wanda, my sister.</i>

01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.245
Yes, sister?

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:22.323
<i>Please don't do this.</i>

01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.805
Don't you want to be
with Jared? And Jamie?

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.321
<i>It doesn't have to be this way.</i>

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:33.329
<i>You don't have to die.</i>

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:38.569
<i>You really could
go to another world,</i>

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.808
<i>the way you've been
telling everyone.</i>

01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:45.602
Thank you,

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:50.204
but by the time I got
to the closest planet,

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.280
you, Jamie, Jared, Ian,

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:03.529
everyone on this world I care
about would be long dead.

01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:09.646
I don't want to
go on without you.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.690
I love you, Mel.

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:19.251
<i>I love you.</i>

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:26.451
<i>You are the purest soul, human
or not, that I've ever met.</i>

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.083
<i>The universe will be a
darker place without you.</i>

01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:39.489
Be happy, Mel.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.764
Be happy

01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:47.925
that after living
so many lives,

01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:52.964
I finally found
something to die for.

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:03.123
Goodbye.
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:35.890
Wanda?

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.325
Wanda.

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.130
Wanda?

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.244
Wanda, can you hear me?

01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:46.764
Where am I?

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.204
Who am I?

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.850
You're you.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.564
Hello, Wanda.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.129
Melanie?

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:04.761
You might want to see yourself.

01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:19.360
You still do that
with your hair.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.644
Doc, you broke your word.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:46.328
They broke it for me.
They made me keep you alive.

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.526
But I told you I didn't want to

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.647
take another life in any world.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:49.721
You didn't.

01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.083
We've been taking souls
out of humans for a month now.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:56.529
But when we took
the soul out of that body,

01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:57.647
she never woke up.

01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.006
The body was dying.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:02.004
The only way to save her
was to put you inside.

01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:07.002
You haven't killed a body.
You've given it life.

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:11.965
I miss you in my head.

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:17.891
What are you thinking, Wanda?

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:24.007
I'm thinking how happy I am.

01:51:51.440 --> 01:51:53.488
It's a strange world.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.930
The strangest.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.724
<i>Our world isn't like
the other worlds they came to.</i>

01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:09.242
<i>The way they see it,</i>

01:52:09.320 --> 01:52:13.689
<i>human beings are just so alien.</i>

01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:19.089
<i>But if one of them can find a
way to live with one of us,</i>

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.330
<i>I wonder.</i>

01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:46.721
Seekers.

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:56.324
No one gets taken.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.246
Everybody out.

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.083
Seeker, I can...
Everybody out.

01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:19.165
Now.

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:35.006
Hmm.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.565
Little bright out
tonight, is it?

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.081
You're human.

01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:57.445
Human

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.610
Mmm-hmm.

01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.850
Not all human.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:13.287
Are you their prisoner?

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:21.241
Yes.
No.

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:24.609
I'm not their prisoner.

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:30.371
I'm their friend.

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.325
They're human.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.043
Human as you.

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.964
We thought we were
the last survivors.

01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.690
So did We.

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:55.727
Till we found
three other groups.

01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:57.845
Now four.

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:01.888
Thought I was the only one
who switched sides.

01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:05.131
I guess you never know where
you're gonna find your home.
