ANDY: <i>Previously on </i>NYPD Blue.

00:02.919 --> 00:05.255
Did you see your dad beat up
your mom that night?

00:05.380 --> 00:07.465
-Yeah.
-Is that the last you saw of her?

00:07.674 --> 00:10.093
I came home and he was puttin'
her in that shopping cart.

00:10.218 --> 00:14.514
He saw his dad kill his mom.
He’ll do what he has to testimony-wise.

00:14.639 --> 00:17.642
Joe Brockhurst, my first partner when
I made detective.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.811
Uh... The other guy who screwed up
the Peeler case.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.271
ANDY: All right. Thanks.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.898
-Sam’s DNA don’t match.
-What?

00:24.315 --> 00:27.736
-(METAL CLANKS)
-(SIGHS) This case is a nightmare.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.947
John and I are meant to be together.
We both know it.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.657
I don’t know if this is any
of my business.

00:32.907 --> 00:34.534
Leave him alone. He’s taken.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.036
There’s plenty of other guys
out there for you.

00:36.119 --> 00:39.664
I’m sorry that you had to deal with that.
I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.167
Looking in her eyes, she wasn’t all there.

00:42.292 --> 00:46.671
She’s bipolar. The last time I saw her,
like, a month ago, she was on her meds

00:46.880 --> 00:49.382
and doin' okay. I think,
maybe she’s gone off.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.135
I don’t think I’m gonna be able
to practice medicine again, John.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.888
If I don’t have that and I don’t have you,
I don’t have anything.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.390
You need to get healthy again.
That’s all that matters right now.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.184
-Will you go with me?
-JOHN: Yes.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.407
Where you been?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.494
Jen walked out of the psych ER
last night.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.662
She’s not home.
She’s not answerin' her cell.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.831
I actually went out on the street,
lookin' for her.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.875
-Morning.
-Mornin'.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.086
Got a guy comin' in on that Clifton case.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.046
If you wanna keep lookin' for Devlin,
I’ll cover it.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.173
-JOHN: Who’s the guy?
-ANDY: Name’s David Lewis.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.551
Taught at her school.
He wrote an odd note in her yearbook.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.471
(SIGHS) "To my special, special pal."

01:37.472 --> 01:40.934
Talked to Cindy’s friend, Angela Malcolm.
She said that Lewis

01:41.059 --> 01:42.644
was a real touchy-feely type.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.814
-Were him and Cindy close?
-She couldn’t say... that ain’t much...

01:45.980 --> 01:48.149
(TELEPHONE RINGING IN DISTANCE)

01:48.358 --> 01:50.276
-John, hit the street.
-I don’t know where to start.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.404
Uh... Dave Lewis for, uh,
Detective Sipowicz.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.656
Yeah. I’m Sipowicz.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.033
Thanks for comin' in. Here, this way.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.578
Get me if Dr. Devlin calls.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.295
-Oh, yeah, here.
-I’m tryin' to quit smoking. Thanks.

02:09.671 --> 02:10.880
Yeah. Have a seat.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.428
-So, Cindy Clifton...
-Been followin' the case lately.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.723
I read about the man who was released
from jail. Tragic.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.184
Yeah, and because of that it’s an open
homicide again,

02:23.268 --> 02:24.811
so we’re talkin' to people Cindy knew.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.563
How can I help?

02:26.729 --> 02:28.398
What was your relationship, you and Cindy?

02:29.649 --> 02:31.317
She was a student at the Donner school.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.570
I taught French and Spanish there.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.780
I don’t think
she was in any of my classes, though.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.575
Then what made you call her
your "special, special pal"

02:38.658 --> 02:39.784
in her yearbook?

02:40.493 --> 02:44.289
-That’s why I’m here, the yearbook note?
-Yeah, what made her so special?

02:44.455 --> 02:46.624
Honestly, I wrote that to all the kids
in my rap group.

02:47.750 --> 02:50.211
Not like music rap. Rap sessions.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.130
Where kids would come
and talk about their issues.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.300
-This was a school thing or outside?
-After school, but sanctioned.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.178
Once a week kids get together and lay out
the stuff that’s troublin' 'em.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.138
-Personal stuff?
-Sure.

03:02.098 --> 03:06.728
By any chance, have you come across
a guy named Sam Jeffers?

03:07.228 --> 03:10.064
-Why do you ask?
-He... he was Cindy’s half-brother,

03:10.231 --> 03:13.443
but the family never recognized that.
Odd situation.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.528
Did Cindy talk about him
in these sessions?

03:15.695 --> 03:18.615
She told me once privately,
he’d done inappropriate things.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.451
-I took that to mean sex.
-Did you tell her parents?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.036
Honestly, I didn’t have the time to.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.456
She was killed three days later
and the man that they said did it

03:26.539 --> 03:29.500
was caught so fast, I didn’t see the point
in upsettin' her family.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.672
-You should talk to Sam Jeffers.
-Yeah, we have. He was ruled out.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.217
Oh... Okay.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.344
So it sounds like you and Cindy
were close.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.595
Not really.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.973
Uh... Being molested is a heavy thing
to tell a passing acquaintance.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.017
I try to be a safe zone for all the kids.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.478
I mean, if they talk about smoking pot
or feelin' alienated,

03:48.561 --> 03:51.397
I don’t freak out like their parents...
(SCOFFS) ...so they open up,

03:51.606 --> 03:54.817
like Cindy did about Sam Jeffers.
She was really upset about him.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.987
-He sounded like a weird guy.
-But like we said, he didn’t kill her.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.907
-Right.
-You still teach at the Donner School?

04:01.199 --> 04:04.452
No, I’m at Tomlinson Franz now,
better money.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.497
Speakin' of which, I have a class
in 20 minutes. So are we...

04:07.622 --> 04:09.749
All done. Thanks for your time.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.709
No problem.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.133
He was real eager to give us Sam Jeffers.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.927
Like he’s been thinkin' about it
for a while.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.973
I'm gonna get this guy's gum
over to the lab. I want his DNA.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.184
You gonna look for Devlin,
or you comin' with me? It’s your call.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.894

I know your school doesn’t want
any bad publicity, but, ma’am,

05:45.928 --> 05:48.014
do you understand this
is a homicide investigation?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.475

05:54.771 --> 05:55.938
This is that Dave Lewis?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.191
Guy’s worked at ten schools
the last 18 years.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.110
Administrators either say
that he moved on of his own accord

06:01.194 --> 06:04.447
-or his teachin' style doesn’t mesh.
-Nothing negative about the guy,

06:04.572 --> 06:06.699
like, they just don’t wanna talk
about him.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.826
Sounds like they’re coverin' their ass.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.372
Hey, boss, I’m headin' out.
Michael’s testifyin' today.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.832
-Tell him we’re all behind him.
-I will.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.253

-Hey, Joe. No, uh, come on in.

Cindy Clifton.

and a Lester Mooney.

Uh... Darnell’s dead ten years.
Mooney left the state but, uh,

06:30.223 --> 06:32.475
-they both got collared for sex with kids.
-Okay.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.185
JOE: Darnell’s more the candidate.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.145
He did a bit for rapin'
a 16-year-old girl.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.857
Mooney’s mostly into males,
it sounds like.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.317
What is it, Medavoy?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.612
Uh... Principal at the Stender School.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.030
Might be somethin'.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.741
-Uh... I’ll get out of your hair.
-Nah... Uh...

06:48.908 --> 06:51.911
We’re lookin' into an old teacher
of Cindy Clifton’s. Guy named David Lewis.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.872
There were parent complaints against Lewis
when he worked at the school

06:55.039 --> 06:57.500
Parents feelin' that he was too close
with the kids.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.128
Principal wouldn’t elaborate,
but he did give me the name

07:00.211 --> 07:03.423
-of one of the parents. Davis White.
-All right, I’ll get him in.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.301
-So, you’re likin' this guy, Dave Lewis?
-Startin' to.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.928
Might keep me up to speed,
if it’s no trouble?

07:09.095 --> 07:12.140
-Anything pops, we’ll grab you.
-I’ll be around the station house.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.726
The desk sergeant, McGinty, him and me
were at the academy 40 years ago.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.228

the blood pumpin',

07:20.940 --> 07:22.275
bein' back in the middle of it.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.125
What you got?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.752
He refused medical aid. He got robbed
and took a smack to the head.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.214
-RITA: What’s your name, sir?
-(SIGHS) Ned Applebaum.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.176
-Did you see who robbed you, Ned?
-Fella in a jogging suit.

07:48.676 --> 07:53.514
Black mustache, oily hair, he had chains
around his neck, gold chains.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.558
OFFICER: Put a description over the, uh...

07:55.975 --> 07:57.685
Might get the whole neighborhood
brought in.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.604
-Did you look at any witnesses?
-Couldn’t find anyone.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.940
It’s like nobody noticed!
They just walked past me!

08:04.192 --> 08:07.278
-What got taken from you, Mr. Applebaum?
-My wallet, cash.

08:08.529 --> 08:10.156
Oh. Jesus...

08:10.781 --> 08:13.868
A necklace. A very special necklace.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.162
-Special because?
-It’s my wife’s.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.749
It was her grandmother’s.
It’s worth 35,000 dollars.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.584
What were you doing with it out here?

08:22.084 --> 08:25.254
I don’t know, I... I didn’t wanna leave it
at the hotel.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.715
-RITA: Where are you in town from?
-Centerville.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.343
Indiana.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.386
-I’m just here for the weekend.
-Where’s your wife?

08:32.762 --> 08:35.056
Havin' a spa morning or somethin'.

08:35.973 --> 08:39.227
So I... I went for a walk.
I didn’t wanna leave it at the hotel.

08:39.810 --> 08:42.396
-She’s gonna kill me.
-But you sure about the guy you saw?

08:42.522 --> 08:44.690
-With the track suit and gold chains?
-Of course.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.692
Because that sounds like description
out of central casting.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.277
Well, that’s who did it.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.196
Could you recognize him
if you saw him again?

08:50.404 --> 08:51.614
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.076
Then track suit and gold chains.
That’s what we’ll go with.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.287
She’s gonna kill me, you understand?
You’re lookin' at a dead man.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.623
Let’s get you down to the station house
to look at some mug books.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.709
-Maybe we can clear this up quick.
-NED: Lord, I hope so.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.884
MICHAEL: My dad pushed me in my room
and hit me.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.928
He told me to stay there.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.807
Then I heard him beatin' my mom.
That went on till it got real quiet.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.518
After it was quiet awhile,
I opened the door to my room.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.937
I couldn’t hear anybody in the apartment,
so I walked out

09:23.020 --> 09:24.480
and I heard somethin' goin' on
in the hall.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.065
Did you look out into the hall?

09:26.399 --> 09:29.443
I looked in the hall and saw my dad
put my mom in a shoppin' cart.

09:29.610 --> 09:33.406
-LEO: Was your mom moving at all?
-She was dead, then he wheeled her off.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.118
-Did you see your dad again that night?
-I didn’t see him till the next day.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.411
Nothing further.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.624
(CLEARS THROAT) Morning, Michael.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.836
I’m goin' to ask you a few questions
about your dad, okay?

09:47.211 --> 09:48.337
MICHAEL Okay.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.172
ERNEST: Has your dad always been
a part of your life?

09:50.464 --> 09:54.468
-He spent seven years in jail.
-Would you call him a good provider?

09:54.844 --> 09:55.845
Nope.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.723
ERNEST: Your mom took care of you,
didn’t she? All by herself.

09:59.724 --> 10:00.850
Yes.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.352
-ERNEST: Your dad ever hit you?
-Sometimes.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.147
-Did that make you angry with him?
-I guess.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.149
-He ever hit your mom?
-Yes.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.942
ERNEST:
You didn’t like that either, right?

10:10.109 --> 10:12.278
-No.
-So it’s fair to say you’ve been angry

10:12.361 --> 10:14.280
-with your dad a lot.
-MICHAEL: I guess.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.658
Michael, before this case,
where you ever in a situation

10:17.742 --> 10:19.327
where you were questioned by the police?

10:23.080 --> 10:24.290
Could you repeat the question?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.459
ERNEST: Before this terrible thing
happened to your mom,

10:26.667 --> 10:30.421
where you ever involved in a situation
where you had to talk to the police

10:30.504 --> 10:31.797
about a criminal incident?

10:34.258 --> 10:35.593
No.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.471
I mean... I don’t remember.

10:38.638 --> 10:43.142
You don’t remember... when a friend
of yours, Shawn Farmer,

10:43.768 --> 10:47.313
broke the jaw of another schoolmate
and you were questioned

10:47.396 --> 10:48.564
by the police about it?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.401
(SIGHS) Yeah, okay.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.113
Do you remember if Shawn Farmer
admitted to the assault right away,

10:56.864 --> 10:59.116
or did he say he was with you at a movie?

10:59.700 --> 11:00.826
He said he was with me.

11:00.993 --> 11:05.873
And what did you say, when the police
asked you whether or not Shawn Farmer

11:06.248 --> 11:07.750
had been with you at a movie?

11:08.542 --> 11:13.547
You told the police, your friend,
Shawn Farmer, was with you at a movie

11:13.756 --> 11:15.883
on the afternoon,
the assault was committed...

11:18.219 --> 11:20.971
-and that wasn’t true, was it?
-Shawn was my friend.

11:21.847 --> 11:25.393
-So you lied because you cared about him.
-Yeah.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.561
And you sure cared about your mom, right?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.271
-Yeah.
-ERNEST: You loved her.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.483
You’re angry with your dad,
you love your mom...

11:33.359 --> 11:36.195
and you have lied to the police before.
Have I got that all correct?

11:36.445 --> 11:37.988
Objection to the form of the question.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.827
Withdrawn. Michael, is today your chance
to get back at your dad

11:42.910 --> 11:44.704
for everything he did to you and your mom?

11:44.912 --> 11:46.455
No. I’m tellin' the truth.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.834
I’m sure you’ve given us no reason
to think you’re not.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.671
-Nothing further.
-Redirect, your honor. Michael...

11:54.839 --> 11:57.466
What did I tell you about the importance
of being honest

11:57.550 --> 12:00.594
-when you testified here today?
-You said to just tell the truth.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.973
And is that what you’ve done,
told the complete and total truth?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.683
Yes.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.560
And that’s been hard for you to do, right?

12:07.643 --> 12:08.686
Yes.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.272
Because you love your dad too, right?

12:15.317 --> 12:16.986
Yes.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.780
Thank you. Nothing further.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.921
Thanks for comin' in, Mr. White.
Have a seat.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.382
We got some questions
regarding a complaint made

12:38.466 --> 12:42.052
about a teacher at the Stender School,
a David Lewis.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.345
That was a few years back.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.684
-What brought this up now?
-It’s part of a investigation.

12:48.851 --> 12:53.689
We understand that you felt Mr. Lewis was,
uh... too close with your daughter.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.609
-Yeah, that’s right.
-What’s that mean?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.112
Look, is Victoria gonna have to come
in and talk to you too?

13:00.237 --> 13:01.947
Because I really don’t want
that to happen.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.616
She’s dealt with enough.

13:04.283 --> 13:05.826
Dealt with enough with Mr. Lewis?

13:05.993 --> 13:08.913
She’s not testifying to anything, not now.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.916
What did David Lewis do
to your daughter? Start there.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.293
He offered her a ride home.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.630
She knew him pretty well from
an afterschool program he ran,

13:17.713 --> 13:19.882
So... she took the ride.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.051
And he wouldn’t let her out
of the car for three hours.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.929
-Did he assault her?
-She says they just drove around

13:25.012 --> 13:26.889
while he tried to convince her
to have sex with him.

13:27.097 --> 13:30.017
She refused over and over again,
until he gave up and let her go.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.354
-Is that what you told the school?
-And my lawyer.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.398
He said we should consider the pressure
on Victoria by putting her through

13:36.482 --> 13:39.026
a nearly unwinnable trial.
So she left the school.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.278
She’s been having nightmares ever since.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.948
Lewis do this to someone else?

13:44.323 --> 13:47.618
Mr. White, we’re investigating David Lewis
for the homicide of a young girl,

13:47.701 --> 13:49.703
-18 years ago.
-Oh, God!

13:49.787 --> 13:52.581
And something we’re runnin'
into at the schools that he’s worked at,

13:52.665 --> 13:56.627
and parents like yourself is that folks
have moved on from the things

13:56.794 --> 14:00.339
that David Lewis has done to them,
that might work to put him in jail.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.259
I looked into it, my lawyer said
he couldn’t make a case.

14:03.425 --> 14:07.096
But are you convinced that all
David Lewis did, with your daughter,

14:07.179 --> 14:08.848
was talk about having sex?

14:09.139 --> 14:10.891
I don’t think
I can have this conversation anymore.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.519
If we know that he did somethin' more
than talk with your daughter,

14:13.686 --> 14:16.689
it’ll go far towards convincin' us
that he’s the right guy for this murder.

14:16.897 --> 14:19.817
Victoria said, all they did was talk
about sex.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.279
-But what does your gut say?
-That you’ve got the right guy.

14:24.947 --> 14:28.450
I will not put my daughter
through a trial. No way.

14:30.744 --> 14:31.787
Leave her alone.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.169
Appreciate you comin' down Mrs. Applebaum.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.466
There’s me wearing the necklace.
My father’s 70th birthday.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.969
We’ll make sure to get this
to local pawnshops,

14:47.136 --> 14:49.305
So if anyone comes in trying
to sell the necklace,

14:49.597 --> 14:51.682
-We’ll get notified right away.
-Good.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.769
So, how are things progressing?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.815
Uh... Well, we’re gonna set
your husband up with some mug books,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.192
see if he can identify the perpetrator.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.445
He said an Italian-looking fellow
stole the necklace from him.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.656
-That’s right.
-Did anyone else see this Italian fellow?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.409
-Um... No.
-It’s my first time in the city,

15:10.868 --> 15:14.580
so I’m wondering, do things like this
normally happen in broad daylight?

15:14.788 --> 15:17.791
It wouldn’t be the first time
but uh, still, it is on the rare side.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.545
Is something bothering you, Jessica?

15:21.879 --> 15:23.631
No... no.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.174
RITA: You’re asking a lot of questions.

15:25.299 --> 15:29.136
It’s just very unfortunate
that this would happen now, on this trip.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.933
Well, not that you’d ever want it
to happen, but why this trip specifically?

15:35.184 --> 15:37.645
It was supposed to be a reconnecting
weekend for us.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.688
You’ve been having trouble at home?

15:40.606 --> 15:42.900
For a little while,
I thought there was someone else.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.029
Ned wasn’t acting like himself
and he suddenly spent a lot of money.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.157
I couldn’t really prove anything,
and he wouldn’t admit it

15:50.282 --> 15:53.577
but then he suggests this weekend
to New York to find ourselves again.

15:53.702 --> 15:57.289
And now, this happens with a necklace
I didn’t even bring.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.584
It’s your necklace,
but he brought it, secretly?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
(CHUCKLES) Can you believe that?

16:03.170 --> 16:05.673
I mean, what was he thinking?

16:05.839 --> 16:09.468
-I guess we’re gonna find out.
-’Cause I won’t stand to be made a fool.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.595
I’m not a fool.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.183
-Didn't I just say too much?
-RITA: We’ll talk to your husband.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.936
If he’s honest, maybe we can keep this
from getting too serious.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.188
I appreciate it.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.233
-I just wanna go home.
-We’ll be in touch.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.196
Moved around a lot of schools
the last 18 years, haven’t you?

16:29.321 --> 16:31.490
Hey, I could’ve told you
that over the phone.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.952
-Yeah. Why so many schools?
-I get bored easy.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.163
ANDY: Or is it more you get caught
bein' inappropriate with students?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.875
-Excuse me? One more time?
-Remember Victoria White?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.878
DAVID: From the Stender School.
What does she have to do with anything?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.923
Why don’t you tell us about the ride
you gave her?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.843
Oh... okay.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.720
The three-hour ride?

16:53.220 --> 16:55.180
-Is that what someone told you?
-No. Her father.

16:55.597 --> 16:57.891
Three hours which I can account
for being somewhere else.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.894
Three hours that she spent
with her boyfriend after I dropped her off

17:01.020 --> 17:02.563
and didn’t wanna tell her father.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.565
Did you ever give
Cindy Clifton a ride home?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.233
Oh, come on...

17:07.276 --> 17:08.610
That’s where this is goin'?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.989
-No. I never did.
-ANDY: You never drove her around...

17:12.072 --> 17:13.365
-(SIGHS)
-...askin' her to have sex with you,

17:13.532 --> 17:16.118
like she was doin' with her
half-brother, Sam Jeffers,

17:16.201 --> 17:18.287
who you were so eager to have us talk to?

17:18.454 --> 17:21.081
I didn’t know they were having sex.
I just assumed it.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.875
And no to all the rest.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.337
Then how does your DNA wind up
on Cindy Clifton’s dead body?

17:27.796 --> 17:32.384
Your DNA matches sperm found on
and inside Cindy Clifton, 18 years ago.

17:33.427 --> 17:35.554
My DNA, which just appeared to you?

17:35.679 --> 17:38.599
The piece of gum that you left
in our trash can this mornin'.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.521
Take your time.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.398
Okay.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.817
Okay.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.989
-I never hurt her.
-Molestin' her, that doesn’t count?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.657
It was an indiscretion.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.827
She was physically precocious
and she seduced me.

17:58.952 --> 18:02.748
She did tell me that she was having sex
with her half-brother and she liked it.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.374
She wanted more.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.878
I should’ve stopped her,
but she just came on so strong.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.714
-Oh, boy.
-Talk about the day she died.

18:11.632 --> 18:15.135
That’s the day I’m talkin' about.
It happened that afternoon in my car.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.763
Then she left,
and later, I heard she’d been killed.

18:17.846 --> 18:20.557
-That’s a lie.
-I swear. I swear I never hurt her.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.726
You killed Cindy Clifton
and you’re gonna admit it.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.688
-No. You’ll never hear me say that.
-We’re just gettin' started on you, Dave.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.983
-Believe me.
-I have nothin' more to say. Nothing.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.152
I think it might be time for me
to talk to a lawyer.

18:32.236 --> 18:36.406
Yeah, and you can think about it in here.
We got enough for now.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.247
-We’ll see you in a bit, Dave.
-(DOOR OPENING)

18:45.666 --> 18:48.544
What are the chances of finding
a witness to the homicide?

18:49.753 --> 18:51.922
-Slim.
-Or even someone who saw

18:52.005 --> 18:54.341
Dave Lewis and Cindy Clifton
together close to the time of the murder?

18:54.508 --> 18:56.802
He copped to the sexual assault.
That don’t mean nothin'?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.596
My office is still reeling
from the wrongful imprisonment

18:59.680 --> 19:02.182
of Leonard Peeler.
And I’ve been told explicitly,

19:02.307 --> 19:04.309
"No weak knee-jerk arrests
that could make us look

19:04.393 --> 19:05.602
"like we’re tryna save face."

19:05.894 --> 19:08.355
Is Lewis at least a collar for the sex
with a minor?

19:08.647 --> 19:12.192
The statute of limitations is five years
from the time of the incident.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.778
Even in these circumstances,
with a murdered girl?

19:14.862 --> 19:17.239
It’s time-barred. It can’t be used
against him in court

19:17.322 --> 19:20.868
and without independent evidence tying him
to the murder, there’s no case.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.995
I don’t doubt
Dave Lewis killed Cindy Clifton,

19:23.120 --> 19:24.872
but my office won’t proceed

19:24.997 --> 19:27.833
-until it’s airtight.
-We’ll call you when it is.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.924

19:40.345 --> 19:42.848

we better be able to find you,

19:45.475 --> 19:48.270
and you’re done workin' at that school
or any other school. You’re done teaching.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.189

19:52.316 --> 19:55.152

I’ll come after you personally.

I think I’ll just go about living my life.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.165
You don’t wanna mouth off, Dave.
That’ll get my fist in your stomach,

20:08.248 --> 20:09.499
because I know you’re the guy.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.419
Whether or not I’m the guy,
you’re investigatin' a crime

20:12.544 --> 20:15.464
from 18 years ago.
You have no witness, no evidence.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.841
-We got your DNA.
-DAVID: Which proves the indiscretion.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.636
And the statute of limitations on that
ran out years ago.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.680
Which I’m sure, you were just told.
Otherwise, I wouldn’t be goin' home now.

Walk outta here, or you’re gonna get
that slug in your gut.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.519

-and I’ll teach again, Detective.
-Not in New York.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.243
Does she have any family
or friends you can contact?

22:50.327 --> 22:51.620
No, there’s no family in town.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.664
I don’t think she has any friends,
but I’ll... I'll look into it.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.834
All right. Uh... Well,
it’s gonna be another hour for dialysis.

22:58.001 --> 23:00.295
-I can call you when she’s done.
-(SIGHS) All right. Thanks.

23:03.673 --> 23:06.259
-(SIGHS, SNIFFS)
-Can’t see her for a while.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.805
-You all right?
-I’m seein' my dad all over again.

23:10.055 --> 23:13.600
It’s like another... train wreck,
I can’t stop.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.143
ANDY: John, this girl’s sick.

23:15.268 --> 23:17.479
If she don’t take her medication,
that’s not on you.

23:17.562 --> 23:18.814
(SIGHS) That’s cold comfort.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.484
You want me stick around here with you?
Because I will.

23:22.734 --> 23:26.405
-No. Who called?
-Gibson. It’s official from the lab.

23:26.613 --> 23:30.534
Lewis’ DNA was definitely confirmed
to match what we got off Cindy Clifton.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.660
Oh, yeah?

23:31.785 --> 23:34.413
I was gonna call in Gerald Clifton,
see does he remember Lewis.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.748
-I can take it alone.
-No. Let’s go.

23:44.798 --> 23:46.591
-Thanks, Hank.
-No problem.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.595
Uh... Yeah, I... No one so far.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.641
I got a question, for you, Ned.
Was there anything besides vacation

23:54.850 --> 23:56.351
-that brought you to New York?
-No.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.728
Because we understand
you’ve been acting odd lately.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.480
and spendin' money you don’t have.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.274
Well. I’d like to know
where this comes from.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.568
Your wife, who thinks
you’re screwin' around

24:04.651 --> 24:06.528
and didn’t know you brought
the necklace to New York or why.

24:06.862 --> 24:11.741
I was gonna, take her to the rainbow room
for a surprise...

24:12.367 --> 24:13.410
and surprise her with it,

24:13.493 --> 24:15.829
she just keeps it sitting in a safe
at home.

24:17.205 --> 24:20.000
She told you, she thinks
I’m screwin' around?

24:20.375 --> 24:22.127
Do you wanna go to jail
for insurance fraud,

24:22.294 --> 24:24.796
or would you rather come clean
and maybe see this all go away?

24:25.005 --> 24:26.089
Oh, boy.

24:27.090 --> 24:28.091
Boy, oh, boy!

24:28.717 --> 24:31.636
Now, I was legitimately robbed
on the street.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.806
Yeah, by a cliché who no one saw
in the middle of the morning.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.892
I’m sorry, but that’s what happened!

24:38.143 --> 24:40.353
The fact is... though I...

24:41.688 --> 24:44.900
I am sorta... havin' a relationship.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.361
Which is a coincidence to you
gettin' robbed?

24:48.695 --> 24:51.448
-That what you’re sayin'?
-I was in Little Italy

24:51.531 --> 24:53.492
to give the necklace to my lady friend.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.578
But just temporarily
till she could secure a loan.

24:56.661 --> 25:00.415
But you got robbed at the appointed time
and place of this meeting.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.918
-Yes.
-Have you talked to your lady friend

25:03.001 --> 25:04.085
about this?

25:04.461 --> 25:06.546
I’ve never actually spoken to her.

25:06.713 --> 25:09.716
-Is this an internet lady friend?
-Yes.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.553
-(CHUCKLES) What’s her name?
-Pauline.

25:14.721 --> 25:17.182
She lives in Brooklyn
with her three kids.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.727
The boy was diagnosed with leukemia.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.271
She’s spent all of her savings
on treatment.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.774
They’re threatenin' to cut off her water!

25:25.982 --> 25:27.692
Is Pauline who you’ve been spendin'
money on?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.986
I sent her gifts through the mail.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.989
-To where?
-A PO box.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.493
Jessica and I’ve been married
for 15 years.

25:37.202 --> 25:41.331
-I’ve never done anything like this.
-That’s enough. The PO box.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.709
I mean, before, when I said,
I was a dead man,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.836
now, when Jess hears this...

25:48.255 --> 25:50.423
I’m really a dead man. (SNIFFLES)

25:55.428 --> 25:57.347
-I got your message.
-Thanks for comin' in.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.558
Why don’t you have a seat?

26:02.727 --> 26:03.728
(SIGHS)

26:05.855 --> 26:08.400
-How you holdin' up?
-You said you had news.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.779
This guy who used to teach
at the Donner School, David Lewis,

26:13.446 --> 26:16.575
he admitted that he sexually assaulted
your daughter the day she was killed

26:16.783 --> 26:19.035
and his DNA matches what we found
on Cindy.

26:19.119 --> 26:21.329
-This man’s in custody?
-He’s not, yet,

26:21.788 --> 26:26.668
because even though he admits to the sex,
the statute of limitations has run out.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.421
We’re still workin' on tyin' him
to the murder.

26:29.546 --> 26:33.174
Where's the chances that a man
who sexually assaults a girl who’s killed

26:33.258 --> 26:36.553
-that same day is not involved?
-None. There’s no chance. He’s our guy.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.098
But evidence-wise, we’re just not on
solid enough ground for the DA to proceed.

26:40.890 --> 26:44.853
So... we’re hopin' to find something new
to use against him.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.107
(SIGHS) I don’t know how I can help you.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.067
Have you heard the name,
David Lewis before now?

26:51.484 --> 26:53.695
-No.
-Did Cindy ever mentioned any after-school

26:53.862 --> 26:56.740
-programs she was involved in?
-She played soccer. That’s all I remember.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.075
No, this... this probably
would have been referred

26:59.159 --> 27:01.286
to as a... a teacher-student counseling.

27:01.661 --> 27:02.704
I don’t recall that.

27:03.121 --> 27:05.081
-Think your wife might?
-I doubt it.

27:05.373 --> 27:08.001
-If you could ask her...
-Detective, I can’t ask her.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.003
She can’t handle any more of this.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.131
Yeah, I understand this has been
a very difficult couple of weeks.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.508
It’s nearly torn the family apart.

27:15.634 --> 27:19.679
It’s nearly... driven us insane
from the anguish and the guilt.

27:19.971 --> 27:23.516
We’re doin' what we can to rebuild.
Now, Sam’s part of the family now.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.728
We’re tryna make up for some
of the wrong that’s been done to him.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.314
We were having lunch together,
that’s what you took me away from.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.941
-I just want this guy in jail.
-So do I.

27:32.859 --> 27:36.237
But I have to weigh that against
the damage it would cause my family

27:36.363 --> 27:38.615
to engage in another fishing expedition.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.243
-All right.
-(SIGHS) We have to get on with our lives.

27:46.414 --> 27:47.874
We have to heal.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.794
(SIGHING)

27:54.547 --> 27:55.882
Let’s keep workin'.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.225
You’re not the delivery guy.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.935
-Guess not.
-Can we talk to you a minute?

28:07.143 --> 28:08.186
Why?

28:08.269 --> 28:10.188
RITA: Do you know a guy named
Ned Applebaum, Mr. Knapp?

28:10.647 --> 28:12.857
-Never heard of him.
-Uh... Then it shouldn’t take long.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.486
-It’s a real mess in there.
-We can handle it. Let’s go inside.

28:19.781 --> 28:23.785
-You work in computers?
-Day trader, successful day trader.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.538
-So, yeah, I don’t know your guy Applebee.
-Applebaum.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.249
You haven’t been conducting
a relationship with him online

28:29.332 --> 28:31.918
-under the name "Pauline"?
-(CHUCKLES) No.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.046
KELLY: You haven’t been receivin' gifts
from him at a PO box on 2nd Avenue?

28:35.255 --> 28:38.174
-Where you gettin' this from, hon?
-A PO box registered in your name.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.969
And you’re gonna wanna lose
the shocked greenhorn bit tight about now.

28:42.429 --> 28:46.349
(SIGHS) Okay. Yes, I have a PO box.
I get my mail there.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.643
Is it possible that guys
runnin' the PO box place

28:48.727 --> 28:50.395
rippin' someone off, using my name?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.147
It’s a question for them.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.025
-What’s this?
-It’s my chill gear.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.236
It’s the outfit you used to rip off
Ned Applebaum.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.779
KELLY: All we want is the necklace back.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.574
That happens, you may find us
very cool about this.

29:02.782 --> 29:04.659
Or use the "wasn’t me" defense again,
and you’re in a line up

29:04.743 --> 29:06.202
in jail within two hours.

29:08.788 --> 29:12.834
-I sold it to a guy. I can get it back.
-Explain yourself.

29:13.251 --> 29:16.463
I went online, I put it out there,
I was a lonely, single mom,

29:16.796 --> 29:19.591
-and this hayseed responded.
-You’ve been hitting him up for gifts?

29:19.799 --> 29:22.844
-Little stuff here and there.
-He’s 20 grand in the hole.

29:23.011 --> 29:27.432
I like nice things. Then I got into a fix
on a Rockets-Lakers, Suns-Kings parlay.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.018
-So I went for the gusto.
-The necklace.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.021
I wasn’t specific,
but I laid out a big number.

29:33.563 --> 29:35.565
He said he wanted to meet me
and deliver it in person.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.443
So you dressed up as a goombah
and took him off.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.570
LEN: He said he was insured
and come on!

29:40.695 --> 29:43.948
Anybody that stupid, I mean,
don’t they sorta deserve a lesson?

29:44.407 --> 29:47.410
-The name of who’s got the necklace.
-LEN: Then I can get back to work?

29:48.077 --> 29:50.330
I wanna catch the <i>Nikkei</i>
before closing bell.

29:52.415 --> 29:55.919
KELLY: Turn around, idiot.
You are going in the system.

29:56.002 --> 29:58.880
-You said you’d be cool.
-We lied, Pauline. Let’s go.

30:05.887 --> 30:06.930
(SIGHS)

30:08.139 --> 30:12.393
Only 15 residents in the buildings
near where Cindy Clifton’s body was found

30:12.560 --> 30:15.313
-have been there for more than 18 years.
-Any of 'em remember the case?

30:15.730 --> 30:17.565
Four of 'em. But none of ’em
were any help.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.943
Thanks, Medavoy. (SIGHING)

30:20.151 --> 30:23.238
We could always call the child molester
Joe Brockhurst dug up,

30:23.321 --> 30:26.032
-uh, we know he lived in the area.
-Uh… He's a waste of time.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.534
I know.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.204
-So, how’d it go?
-Uh... we broke for a day.

30:31.579 --> 30:34.999
-How is Michael?
-He’s good… he’s good, he’s, uh, okay.

30:35.291 --> 30:38.461
Uh... Defense got in some shots
off an assault case at Michael’s school

30:38.586 --> 30:40.046
where he lied for a friend.

30:41.089 --> 30:43.800
-You know about this?
-No, no, and Michael said he never

30:43.925 --> 30:46.553
-even thought to bring it up.
-It's kind of a reach.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.471
Yeah, well, it didn’t go over that way.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.266
Maybe I’m overreactin' ’cause
Michael kept looking at me

30:51.349 --> 30:52.809
for help and I couldn’t give it to him.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.436
It’s not overreactin'.
It’s bein' a good parent.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.398
Yeah, I guess.
We’ll be back at it tomorrow.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.236
Sergeant downstairs just called.
Dave Lewis is DOA at his apartment.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.003
-She found him?
-OFFICER: Heard movin' around in here,

31:20.086 --> 31:21.212
which normally don't during the day.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.548
-So she checked the door. It was open.
-(JOHN SIGHING)

31:23.631 --> 31:24.632
(SIGHS)

31:26.134 --> 31:28.803
-You heard people in here earlier?
-I... I just heard noise.

31:28.970 --> 31:32.015
-You hear a scuffle?
-Just... just moving around.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.393
-More than one person or just him?
-I just heard moving around.

31:35.768 --> 31:39.314
H... he’s normally at school
during the day, so I checked the door.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.316
-ANDY: You see anyone come or go?
-SELMA: No.

31:41.441 --> 31:43.818
-ANDY: He ever have company?
-SELMA: Not that I’ve seen.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.822
-ANDY: You know him to use drugs?
-No, but... (SCOFFS) Who can tell?

31:48.740 --> 31:49.782
Thanks.

31:52.285 --> 31:53.995
Doesn’t look like
there’s any other tracks on him

31:54.078 --> 31:58.041
-but no signs of struggle, either.
-Yeah. The apartment is totally intact.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.209
(SIGHS) What was he like
when you kicked him?

32:00.335 --> 32:03.212
-(SCOFFS) Cocky.
-So, he picks today to try heroin?

32:03.880 --> 32:06.633
Maybe he’s been smokin' or snortin' it
and he decided to shoot up.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.345
(SIGHS)

32:11.054 --> 32:12.555
All right, it’s a suicide for now.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.350
And it stays that way
until somethin' proves it’s not.

32:16.309 --> 32:17.560
(SIGHS)

32:33.284 --> 32:35.703
Could use a cleaning, but it’s intact.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.082
Your husband may be needed down the line
for testimony and so forth,

32:39.165 --> 32:40.667
but he’s free to go.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.253
So this whole weekend was about him
giving my necklace to his girlfriend

32:44.379 --> 32:45.880
that turned out to be a man?

32:46.673 --> 32:49.133
He said he was loaning it out
for collateral.

32:50.176 --> 32:51.469
You buy that?

32:51.678 --> 32:54.097
He was fed a lot of lies
by this phony Pauline.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.598
He seemed to honestly believe him

32:55.682 --> 32:58.518
Or he’s playin ignorant to keep
from getting thrown out of the house.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.562
-Has he got a reputation for that?
-(SIGHS) No.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.524
KELLY: If I was his wife, I probably
wouldn’t believe him either,

33:04.649 --> 33:07.026
but from the way he’s been acting,
it could be true.

33:08.069 --> 33:11.614
-How’s he been acting?
-Contrite, honest, shamed.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.243
He was actually free to go hours ago,
but he was scared to face you.

33:15.618 --> 33:17.161
As he damn well should be.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.999
Jessica, there are two kinds of folks
we deal with a lot.

33:21.374 --> 33:25.878
The first are bad people doing bad things
who we lock up and wash our hands off.

33:26.629 --> 33:30.299
The second are good people
who do stupid things, in those cases,

33:30.383 --> 33:33.553
we try to help out as best we can
to avoid further damage.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.931
Your husband falls
into the second category.

33:37.223 --> 33:40.727
-You think he was just bein' stupid?
-Might be worth a conversation.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.439
Or not, and we’ll get him a cab.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.065
Well...

33:47.066 --> 33:50.611
I did just start a mail-order catalogue
business a few months ago...

33:51.362 --> 33:54.449
and maybe he hasn’t been
getting the attention he’s used to.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.159
Still, that’s no excuse.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.996
You wanna talk to him?
He’s... he’s right down the hall.

-EDDIE: And nothin' from the neighbors?
-Lady next door heard movin' around,

34:48.795 --> 34:52.048
-but she didn’t see anyone.
-I, uh, I notified Lewis’ brother.

34:52.256 --> 34:54.008
He said there was no history
of drug problems.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.177
But, uh, Lewis was kind of a loner.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.847
-So maybe the guilt got to him.
-Yeah, maybe.

EDDIE: Or what?
Clifton’s worth a conversation?

35:02.975 --> 35:05.228
I can’t go to them again.
They’ve been through too much already.

35:05.311 --> 35:08.898
-If it’s indicated, you got to.
-It’s not. The father, Gerald...

35:09.649 --> 35:11.317
he was in no frame of mind to do this.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.237
What about the guy you had in earlier,
Davis White?

35:14.904 --> 35:17.657
Well, he was at work all day.
Three co-workers confirmed it.

-She calmed down enough to ask for you,

36:49.081 --> 36:51.209

-More than anyone.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.340
Then do it for me.

37:41.175 --> 37:44.053
-Okay.
-Because I can’t lose you like this.

you care for me and want me to get well.

what he’s talking about.

a rohypnol shot earlier, John.

To knock me out so they can rape me.
