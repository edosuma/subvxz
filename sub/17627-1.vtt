AND WE'LL JUST FIND THE LIGHT

59:33.337 --> 59:36.306
SO WE CAN TELL WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON AROUND HERE.

59:38.976 --> 59:40.144
OF COURSE.

59:40.210 --> 59:41.912
[clattering]

59:41.979 --> 59:46.216
NATHAN, NATHAN, HEY, HEY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS.

59:46.283 --> 59:47.952
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

59:49.219 --> 59:53.157
[Johnny C yelling]

59:53.223 --> 59:55.660
[Johnny C groaning]
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT IT,
ALL RIGHT.

59:55.726 --> 59:57.294
(Nathan)
YOU OK?

59:57.361 --> 59:59.797
NEVER BETTER. THANKS.

59:59.864 --> 01:00:03.167
GOOD. NOW, LOOK,
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY OUT.

01:00:03.233 --> 01:00:04.434
(Eli)
COME ON.

01:00:04.501 --> 01:00:06.336
COME ON, OPEN.

01:00:06.403 --> 01:00:08.673
OPEN, 'CAUSE I'M HERCULES,
I'M STRONG.

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.476
OR NOT.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.252
LOOK, IF YOU GUYS
DON'T WANNA TALK TO ME

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.988
AFTER THIS WEEKEND,
I UNDERSTAND.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:26.390
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:29.393
THIS WEEKEND AND
EVERYTHING ELSE
I SCREWED UP.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:33.163
I MEAN, IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T WANNA BE
FRIENDS WITH ME, EITHER.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.398
WELL, YOU'RE NOT US.

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:36.200
IF WE WOULD'VE
STOPPED BEING FRIENDS

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.702
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
YOU SCREWED UP,

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:39.336
WE WOULD'VE DONE IT
A LONG TIME AGO.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.138
YEAH, BUT I'M A TOTAL LOSER.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.306
WHAT AM I?

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:49.113
LOOK, NATHAN,
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:52.049
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D DO IT, TOO.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:55.820
MAYBE I'M SCARED
I'D NEVER MEET MY LISA,
OR MY HALF-AS-COOL-AS-LISA.

01:00:59.256 --> 01:01:01.091
MAYBE I'M SCARED
OF BEING ALONE.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:04.294
WHO ISN'T, BRO, YOU KNOW?

01:01:04.361 --> 01:01:07.898
TO TELL THE TRUTH,
I'VE ALWAYS KIND OF
EXPECTED TO END UP ALONE.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:12.502
I MEAN, I'M NOT THE MOST
STUDLY GUY IN THE UNIVERSE.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.471
YOU'RE SMART THOUGH, MAN.
WOMEN LIKE THAT.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:15.940
HE'S NOT THAT SMART.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:18.042
WELL, AT LEAST I DIDN'T
CHEAT ON MY S.A.T.s.

01:01:18.108 --> 01:01:19.376
NEITHER DID I.

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:22.880
WHY LIE?

01:01:22.947 --> 01:01:25.082
SAME REASON YOU TRIED TO JOIN
THE MILE HIGH CLUB.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:26.817
WE ALL TRY TO BE
SOMETHING WE'RE NOT.

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:28.552
THAT DID COUNT.
NO.

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:29.720
YOU KNOW IT DID.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.488
NO.
IT DIDN'T?

01:01:31.555 --> 01:01:34.058
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

01:01:36.961 --> 01:01:39.263
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX
EARLIER TONIGHT.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:42.332
I ONLY PRETENDED TO
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT YOU GUYS.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.968
YOU MEAN TO TELL US
THEN YOU DIDN'T EVEN

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.903
TAKE THE LITTLE 2 FINGERS
DOWNSTAIRS

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:48.505
AND PLAY WITH
THE LITTLE BATHING SUIT AREA?

01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:51.208
WE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME.

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:52.442
WE DID?

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:53.778
YEAH, WE DID.

01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:56.180
BUT WE APPRECIATED THE EFFORT,

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:57.848
SO WE WEREN'T
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

01:01:57.915 --> 01:01:59.149
YOU KNOW, MAYBE THIS WASN'T

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.585
SUCH A BAD BACHELOR PARTY
WEEKEND AFTER ALL, HUH?

01:02:01.651 --> 01:02:03.287
NO, LET'S BE HONEST.
IT SUCKED.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:04.454
OK.

01:02:06.190 --> 01:02:09.860
MAN, I'M STARVING.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:12.963
FIRST THING I'M GONNA EAT
WHEN WE GET OUT OF HERE

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:16.500
IS PRIME RIB, MASHED POTATOES,

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:20.704
CANDIED YAMS,
SMOTHERED WITH GRAVY. YES.

01:02:20.771 --> 01:02:22.840
I'M GONNA TOP THAT.
I'M GONNA HAVE MYSELF

01:02:22.907 --> 01:02:24.975
A GALLON OF
COOKIE-DOUGH ICE CREAM

01:02:26.443 --> 01:02:28.545
WITH A NICE BIG CHOCOLATE
CHIP COOKIE ON TOP.

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.147
OK.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:31.949
I'M GONNA DIP IT
IN THE COOKIE DOUGH--
IT'S MY TURN.

01:02:32.016 --> 01:02:33.417
OH, MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW.

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:34.819
YOU DON'T KNOW.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:39.089
$0.99 SHRIMP COCKTAIL,
6 TINY LITTLE SHRIMPS

01:02:39.156 --> 01:02:41.725
THE LITTLE
FACTORY-PROCESSED ONES?

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:46.096
(Johnny C)
SHRIMP.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:53.537
[snoring]

01:03:00.811 --> 01:03:03.547
(Z Bob)
I MAY HAVE SCREWED UP A LOT
OF THINGS IN THE LAST 4 YEARS

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.816
[echoing]
BUT THIS WEEKEND
WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM.

01:03:09.053 --> 01:03:11.521
HEY, EXCUSE ME.
THIS IS MY BUDDY NATHAN.

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.523
AND IT'S HIS LAST WEEKEND
AS A SINGLE GUY.

01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:15.125
SAY NO MORE.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:22.366
(Nathan)
YES! YES!

01:03:22.432 --> 01:03:26.070
WELL, THANKS FOR
THE GREAT BACHELOR PARTY.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.204
I'M GOING HOME NOW.

01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:28.372
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:03:28.438 --> 01:03:29.606
(Z Bob)
YES.

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.241
OH, NO, NO, NO, HEY.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.777
EXCUSE ME,
WHY ARE WE SHIFTING TO HIM?
THIS IS MY DREAM.

01:03:33.844 --> 01:03:37.848
ALL RIGHT, THE PANTIES,
BUT CAN WE SEE WHAT THEY
CAME OFF OF?

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.016
(Nathan)
WAKE UP.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.150
NO, NO, DON'T WAKE ME UP.

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.019
NO. NO,
I HAVEN'T GOT LAID YET.

01:03:42.086 --> 01:03:43.820
YOU CAN'T WAKE-- DON'T
WAKE-- DON'T WAKE ME UP.

01:03:43.888 --> 01:03:46.123
WAKE UP. WAKE UP.

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:47.724
(Nathan)
COME ON, WAKE UP.

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.293
GET YOUR ASS UP. COME ON.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.595
GET YOUR... WAKE UP.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.130
COME ON. WAKE UP.
(Nathan)
WAKE UP, COME ON.

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:56.200
WHOEVER IS PISSING ON ME
IS A DEAD MAN.

01:03:57.767 --> 01:03:58.969
GET UP.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.538
WHERE'D YOU GET A MOP?

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:02.907
I FOUND A BUCKET OUTSIDE.

01:04:02.973 --> 01:04:04.108
OUTSIDE?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.309
(Nathan)
ASH, WAKE UP.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.978
ASH, WAKE UP.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:09.146
I'M UP.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:10.414
LOOK, I FOUND A BACK DOOR.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.648
LET'S GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:14.151
HEY, ELI.
I FOUND A WAY OUT.

01:04:15.052 --> 01:04:16.520
YOU'RE CLEAN.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.989
YEAH, THERE'S A MOP
AND BUCKET OUT BACK.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.458
[spluttering]

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.493
OH, GOD.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.561
[moaning]

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.168
HEY, WHAT THE--

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.613
OH, MY GOD.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.383
NO, NO, IT'S A MOP, DUDE.
IT'S A MOP, MOP.

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:48.685
ALL RIGHT.

01:04:48.752 --> 01:04:51.855
JESUS. FOR A SECOND,
MAN, I THOUGHT...

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:53.657
I THOUGHT FOR A SECOND...

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.891
RIGHT HERE.
YEAH, HERE WE GO, DUDE.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:04:56.093
THERE WE GO.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.827
OH, YEAH.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.629
RELAX, E,
THERE'S NO DOG.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:01.265
THERE WE GO.

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:05.002
[growling]

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:08.738
SO, ELI, YOU FIGURED OUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA
GET OUT OF HERE?

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:12.242
WE'RE COMPLETELY FENCED IN,
AND WE'RE SURROUNDED
BY RAZOR WIRE.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.643
YOU'RE NOT THINKIN'
WE'RE ACTUALLY

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:15.412
GONNA CLIMB THAT FENCE,
DO YOU?

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.147
NO.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.423
JOHNNY?

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.325
(Z Bob)
HEY, JOHNNY C,

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:29.659
JOHNNY,

01:05:29.726 --> 01:05:30.995
DUDE, ARE YOU OK?

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:34.231
[Johnny C screaming]

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:35.332
[all screaming]

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:39.203
[laughs]

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.337
YOU GUYS ARE PATHETIC.

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:41.571
THAT'S NOT FUNNY!

01:05:41.638 --> 01:05:42.739
(Johnny C)
COME ON.

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.046
(Eli)
HEY, YOU GUYS,
YOU DON'T THINK

01:05:49.113 --> 01:05:50.914
THERE'S ANY RATS
DOWN HERE, DO YOU?

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:54.951
(Ash)
ELI, FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE,
COULD YOU JUST NOT BE A GIRL?

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:57.587
(Z Bob)
WHAT THE FUCK IS...

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:10.367
PLEASE,
DON'T TELL ME THERE'S
ANY HEADS IN THERE, OK?

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.203
WELL?

01:06:16.906 --> 01:06:19.443
YOU CAN RELAX, ELI.
IT'S NOT SEVERED HEADS.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:21.845
HOLY...
SHIT!

01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.180
OH, MY GOD!

01:06:23.247 --> 01:06:24.581
YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT THIS IS, RIGHT?

01:06:24.648 --> 01:06:27.084
THAT'S THE MONEY
THAT WAS STOLEN
FROM THE CASINO LAST NIGHT.

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:29.186
THAT'S $5 MILLION.

01:06:29.253 --> 01:06:30.487
THE PEOPLE
THAT STOLE THIS--

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:31.821
THEY'RE ALL DEAD!

01:06:31.888 --> 01:06:34.091
WHICH MEANS
WE'RE THE ONLY ONES
WHO KNOW WHERE THIS IS.

01:06:34.158 --> 01:06:36.060
YES!
HOLY SHIT!

01:06:36.126 --> 01:06:37.261
OH, MY GOD!

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.596
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS MEANS?
WE'RE RICH!

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:40.897
CALM DOWN.
WE'RE RICH!

01:06:40.964 --> 01:06:42.032
(Ash)
WHOA!

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:43.867
(Eli)
WHOA!
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHAT?

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.069
HOLD UP.

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:47.003
JUST, LET'S THINK
ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND.

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:49.339
JUST CALM DOWN
AND JUST TRY TO
THINK ABOUT IT.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.808
OK?
OK. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:54.711
THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.246
THAT WOULD KILL
FOR THIS MUCH MONEY.

01:06:56.313 --> 01:06:57.981
AM I RIGHT?
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

01:06:58.048 --> 01:06:59.283
WHAT THE--

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:00.584
WHOEVER'S NOT COMFORTABLE
TAKING THE MONEY

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.752
SHOULDN'T BE
FORCED INTO TAKING IT.

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.888
I'M SURE THE REST OF US
WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY
TO SPLIT UP YOUR SHARE

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.157
OF $5 MILLION!

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:08.758
$5 MILLION!
HOLY SHIT!

01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:10.327
[screaming]

01:07:12.896 --> 01:07:15.599
(Ash)
THERE IS $1 MILLION HERE
FOR EACH OF US.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.767
LET'S KEEP MOVING.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:21.105
1, 2, 3.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.206
[groans]

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:23.340
(Johnny C)
COMING UP.

01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:24.574
COMING UP.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:25.642
[grunting]

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:29.313
MAN.
GOT HIM.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.119
(Z Bob)
YOU KNOW, IF SOMEBODY
HAD ASKED ME YESTERDAY,

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:36.653
IF I'D GO THROUGH EVERYTHING

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:39.656
THAT WE WENT THROUGH
FOR $1 MILLION,
I'D SAY, HELL, YES.

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:42.392
AND THE THINGS
THAT I'M GONNA DO
WITH THIS MONEY.

01:07:42.459 --> 01:07:44.494
2 WORDS FOR YOU FELLAS,

01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:46.530
MUTUAL FUNDS.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:48.898
(Johnny C)
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO
WITH MY SHARE OF THE MONEY?

01:07:48.965 --> 01:07:53.870
ON RUSH STREET
I'M GONNA OPEN UP
THE--THE JOHNNY C'S BRA SHOP.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.340
BUT IN THE BACK,
IT'LL BE LIKE A STRIP CLUB.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.375
(Ash)
WITH THIS MONEY
I'M MOVING TO JAMAICA

01:07:58.442 --> 01:07:59.976
AND BUY A BIG-ASS FIELD.

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:01.811
I AIN'T GONNA
WASTE MY PLANTS.

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:03.847
FUCK IT, THE MALE
PLANTS GET SMOKED, TOO.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.815
(Nathan)
I'M GONNA GIVE LISA
THE BEST WEDDING EVER.

01:08:05.882 --> 01:08:08.084
AND SCREW OUR HONEYMOON.
I MEAN, HAWAII? SCREW THAT.

01:08:08.152 --> 01:08:09.619
I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA
TAKE A WEEK OFF WORK,

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:11.087
AND WE'LL GO TO...
NO, I'LL TAKE A YEAR OFF.

01:08:11.155 --> 01:08:12.656
OH, SHIT.

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:14.824
YEAH, IT'S OFFICIAL.
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

01:08:14.891 --> 01:08:15.992
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:17.527
NOT IF I'M IN PRISON.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.662
HEY, FOR THE RECORD,
MEN IN PRISON
GET MARRIED EVERY DAY.

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:21.131
IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO BE COMFORTING?

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.700
RELAX. RELAX GUYS.
NOBODY'S GOING TO JAIL.

01:08:26.170 --> 01:08:28.138
WELL, THAT'S ALL
I'M DOING IS WALKING.

01:08:28.205 --> 01:08:31.006
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
ALL I'M DOING IS WALKING
RIGHT NOW.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:32.609
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I'M JUST WALKING.

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.010
JUST WALKING.
WALKING.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:35.345
[siren wailing]

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:37.814
WE'RE RUNNING.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:40.684
ALL RIGHT, RUN!
I LIED, RUN!

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.219
GUYS!

01:08:42.286 --> 01:08:44.220
YOU CAN'T RUN
FROM THE POLICE!

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.224
OH, MY GOD!

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.430
OK, GET DOWN.

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:54.663
DON'T MOVE!

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:55.765
STAY RIGHT THERE.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.167
(officer #1)
OK. OK. DON'T MOVE.

01:08:57.234 --> 01:08:58.535
FACE-DOWN.
(officer #2)
STAY RIGHT THERE.

01:08:59.736 --> 01:09:00.804
(Johnny C)
MAN--

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:03.340
(boys)
WE KNOW. FUCK OSAMA BIN LADEN.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:25.060
YOU SAID YOUR IDENTIFICATION
IS WHERE AGAIN?

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:28.163
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
MY WALLET WAS STOLEN.

01:09:28.232 --> 01:09:30.899
BY A FEMALE
ELVIS IMPERSONATOR?
YES.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.502
SHE'S ALSO
A SPAGHETTI WRESTLER.

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:34.738
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID,
A VERY FAMOUS ONE.

01:09:34.804 --> 01:09:36.340
UH-HUH.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:39.443
SHE'S SO FAMOUS,
HOW COME I HAVEN'T
HEARD OF HER?

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.278
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN THAT PART OF TOWN?

01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:43.412
WE GOT LOST.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:46.283
YOU DIDN'T STOP BY
THE SET OF A PORNO MOVIE,
DID YOU?

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:50.520
US? NO.
JEEZ, I MEAN, I WISH.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.391
[stammering]
WHY DO YOU ASK?

01:09:54.458 --> 01:09:57.026
BECAUSE THE PRODUCER,
NAMED HARRY HARD

01:09:57.093 --> 01:10:01.731
AND HIS SECURITY GUARD,
WERE BEATEN TO DEATH
BY A MANIAC.

01:10:01.798 --> 01:10:04.534
ARE YOU HONESTLY
GONNA TRY TO TELL ME
THAT YOU GUYS ARE IN TOWN

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:06.470
FOR A BACHELOR PARTY WEEKEND?

01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:11.641
WHICH ONE OF YOU
WAS SUPPOSED TO
BE GETTING MARRIED?

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.544
I AM. AT LEAST, I WAS.

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:17.046
WELL, TELL ME ABOUT HER,
YOUR FIANCEE.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:21.918
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
SHE'S--SHE'S SMART,
SHE'S FUNNY.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.222
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER
THE FIRST TIME I MET HER.

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:30.627
SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT GIRL.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:33.697
SHE IS.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:37.801
TRUTH IS,
LISA DESERVES BETTER THAN ME.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:41.938
WELL, I'VE NEVER MET HER,
BUT I--I GOTTA SAY,
I AGREE WITH YOU.

01:10:44.207 --> 01:10:46.810
DO YOU MIND EXPLAINING TO ME
HOW A SUPPOSED BACHELOR PARTY

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.347
TURNED INTO ONE OF
THE BIGGEST ROBBERIES
IN THE HISTORY OF LAS VEGAS?

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:51.548
WE FOUND THE MONEY.

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:52.916
WE HAD NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH THE ROBBERY.

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:55.018
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE OWNERS
OF THE GOLDEN NUGGET SAY.

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.119
WHAT?

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.521
HE SAID THE 5 OF YOU

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.324
INTENTIONALLY TRIED
TO DISTRACT HIM
AND HIS SECURITY STAFF.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:03.026
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:06.563
IS IT? 12 PEOPLE
ID'D YOU AT THE SCENE.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:08.598
12 PEOPLE MAKE A JURY.

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:10.199
YOU BETTER THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.436
HE SAID HIS NAME
WAS CARMINE T. ANGELO.

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:15.439
AND YOU HAD NO IDEA
THAT IT WAS DOMINIC CALCUTTA?

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:18.442
HE SAID HE WAS
AN ASSOCIATE OF MR. KIDD.

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.377
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.178
YOU KNEW HIM?

01:11:22.245 --> 01:11:25.349
MR. KIDD THREW MY
BACHELOR PARTY WEEKEND.

01:11:25.415 --> 01:11:26.950
THAT'S GREAT.

01:11:27.016 --> 01:11:29.419
IT WAS ONE HELL
OF A GREAT TIME.

01:11:29.486 --> 01:11:30.920
I'M SURE IT WAS.

01:11:30.987 --> 01:11:34.924
I GOTTA SAY THAT IT WAS
PROBABLY THE GREATEST
WEEKEND OF MY LIFE.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:38.728
HE MADE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
AND EVERYTHING.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:42.566
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE
BACKSTAGE PASSES
TO SEE WAYNE NEWTON.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.369
DID YOU GET TO
SEE WAYNE'S SHOW?

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:46.703
NO.

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:49.138
THAT'S TOO BAD.

01:11:49.205 --> 01:11:53.276
FOR MY MONEY,
WAYNE PUTS ON
THE BEST SHOW IN TOWN.

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:57.080
ALL RIGHT, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I BELIEVE YOU
FOR A SECOND.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:01.585
NOW YOU TELL ME,
WHY WOULD SOMEONE
PLANNING TO ROB A CASINO

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:04.354
PRETEND TO BE
A BACHELOR PARTY PLANNER?

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:08.224
TO SET US UP, I GUESS.

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.794
WELL, I GUESS IT WORKED,
DIDN'T IT?

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:14.564
THAT'S IT, MAN.
I'M DONE TALKING.

01:12:14.631 --> 01:12:17.100
I'M NOT SAYING ANOTHER THING
WITHOUT MY LAWYER.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.403
ALL RIGHT,
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:22.105
BUT I'M SURE
YOU'LL TALK TO THE FEDS.

01:12:23.306 --> 01:12:25.174
LOOK, I SAID...
WAIT.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:26.943
WHY WOULD I BE
TALKING TO THE FEDS?

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.878
I GUESS YOU DIDN'T HEAR.

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:31.481
F.B.I. AGENT WORKING
UNDERCOVER INSIDE
THE GOLDEN NUGGET

01:12:31.548 --> 01:12:34.150
WAS KILLED LAST NIGHT
IN THE ROBBERY.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:39.623
YOU FELLAS ARE LOOKING
AT A MINIMUM

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:43.460
OF CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT MURDER
OF A FEDERAL OFFICER.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:46.630
THAT'S MANDATORY TIME
IN A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.

01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:49.866
THIS JUST CAN'T
GET ANY WORSE.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:51.635
OH, YEAH?

01:12:51.701 --> 01:12:53.570
YOU EVER DONE ANY TIME?

01:12:53.637 --> 01:12:55.939
[stammering]
CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE, NO.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.644
YOU EVER BEEN FUCKED
IN THE ASS?

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.178
EXCUSE ME?

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.715
I HAVE.

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:08.452
OH, YOU BLEED LIKE SHIT
THE FIRST TIME.

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.354
BUT YOU GET USED TO IT.

01:13:11.421 --> 01:13:15.091
YOU GET USED TO A LOT
OF THINGS IN PRISON.

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:17.861
LIKE HEARING
THE SCREAMS OF DEATH
OF SOME POOR FOOL

01:13:17.927 --> 01:13:21.364
ECHOING THROUGH
THE COLD NIGHT AIR.

01:13:21.431 --> 01:13:23.967
WHILE YOU TRYING
TO JERK OFF

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:27.504
FOR THE 3RD TIME THAT DAY.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:29.773
WONDER WHY EVERY NOW AND THEN

01:13:29.839 --> 01:13:33.276
YOU FIND YOURSELF
THINKING ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

01:13:42.686 --> 01:13:44.320
YOU BOYS EVER DONE ANY TIME?

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:47.023
JUST SAY YES.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.825
[phone ringing]

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:51.761
STONE.
CHUCK LIDDELL, HOW ARE YOU?

01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:54.130
LISTEN,
THANKS FOR THOSE SEATS
THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE FIGHT.

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:56.265
LOIS AND I HAD A GREAT TIME.

01:13:56.332 --> 01:13:57.934
YOU SMELL GOOD.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:00.069
YOU SO PRETTY.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.307
BACHELOR PARTY T-SHIRTS, HUH?

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:09.713
OK. THANKS FOR
THE INFORMATION, CHUCK.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.948
WE'RE JUST ONE HAPPY FAMILY.

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.721
OK, BOYS, IT'S TIME TO GO.

01:14:19.255 --> 01:14:20.857
TIME TO GO.
NO.

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:23.693
SEE YOU.

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.130
LET HIM GO!

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.498
(Eli)
NO!

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.967
YOU CAN RUN,
BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.

01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:35.138
YOU COME ON BACK
AND SEE GOLD TOOTH REAL SOON!

01:14:35.204 --> 01:14:37.173
GOLD TOOTH GONNA FIND YOU!

01:14:40.276 --> 01:14:41.711
NO, OFFICER STONE,
I DON'T WANNA TALK TO YOU.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:43.179
WHY WOULD I WANNA
TALK TO YOU?

01:14:43.246 --> 01:14:44.648
I WANNA TALK TO MY LAWYER.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.016
WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
IS YOU'RE GONNA TALK
TO YOUR DADDY'S LAWYER.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:49.452
WELL, HERE'S THE NEWS
FOR YOUR DADDY'S LAWYER.

01:14:49.519 --> 01:14:52.488
HE'S GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE
WHEN HE HAS TO TALK TO
THE F.B.I.

01:14:52.556 --> 01:14:55.124
DADDY'S NOT GONNA LIKE THAT.
SO GOOD LUCK.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.693
NEXT CUSTOMER.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.105
(Z Bob)
HOW THE HELL DID THINGS
GET THIS BAD?

01:15:09.172 --> 01:15:10.574
(Johnny C)
I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.642
IF I'D HAVE LET NATHAN
GO TO THE AIRPORT
WHEN HE WANTED TO,

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:13.877
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

01:15:13.943 --> 01:15:15.378
(Nathan)
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:17.246
I GUILTED YOU INTO STAYING.
YOU KNOW THAT.

01:15:17.313 --> 01:15:19.015
(Ash)
WE ALL DID.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:20.917
(Nathan)
HEY, IF THIS IS
ANYBODY'S FAULT, IT'S MINE.

01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:22.485
(Z Bob)
HOW EXACTLY
IS THIS YOUR FAULT?

01:15:22.552 --> 01:15:25.488
BECAUSE,
IF YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH,

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:27.891
I DIDN'T WANT
A WILD AND CRAZY
BACHELOR PARTY WEEKEND.

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.859
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?

01:15:29.926 --> 01:15:33.362
SAME REASON YOU LIED ABOUT
CHEATING ON YOUR S.A.T.s.

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:36.032
I WAS TRYING TO BE
SOMETHING I'M NOT.

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:38.401
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.743
OH, MY GOD.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:48.812
PLEASE, DON'T TELL ME
THAT'S WHO I THINK IT IS.

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.784
OK, I NEED WEED, NOW!

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:00.657
(guard)
TRANSPORT 1-9, WE HAVE
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.

01:16:00.724 --> 01:16:02.726
REPEAT, EMERGENCY.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:05.561
TRAVELING WITH 5 SUSPECTS
IN A CASINO ROBBERY
EAST ON HIGHWAY--

01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:07.130
[gun firing]

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:08.598
[tires screeching]

01:16:10.634 --> 01:16:13.002
(Eli)
IT'S A FUCKING SHOTGUN!

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.570
[gun firing continues]

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.842
WE'RE GONNA DIE.
WE'RE GONNA DIE, GUYS.

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.544
WE'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
SHUT THE FUCK UP.

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:30.086
HOW'S IT GOING
BACK THERE, FELLAS?

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:33.156
GUESS YOU FIGURED OUT
WHO REALLY KILLED HARRY.
HAVEN'T YOU?

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:34.590
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:35.992
I GOTTA FRAME SOMEBODY.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:37.761
RELAX.

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:39.796
THE ONLY THING EACH OF YOU
HAS TO DECIDE

01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:41.430
IS HOW YOU WANNA DIE.

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.132
WHAT?

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.168
UH, I'LL TAKE
OVERDOSING ON VIAGRA

01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:46.903
WITH TEENAGE NYMPHOS
WHEN I'M 90, PLEASE.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:48.271
NOT ONE OF YOUR OPTIONS.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:50.439
OK, HOW ABOUT THIS?
HOW ABOUT JUST
A STRAIGHT-UP OVERDOSE?

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:51.574
NO.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:54.744
OK, FINE. WHAT THE HELL
ARE OUR CHOICES?

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:57.180
GETTING CHOPPED UP
INTO BITTY PIECES,

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:58.748
BEING BURNED ALIVE,

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:01.584
BEING BURIED ALIVE,
GETTING EATEN ALIVE

01:17:02.618 --> 01:17:04.087
AND DROWNING.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.155
YOU'RE GONNA EAT US?

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:08.958
NOT ME, YOU SICKO.
MY DOGS ARE.

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.359
AND ONLY ONE OF YOU.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:12.729
EACH OF YOU GETS TO DIE
A DIFFERENT WAY.

01:17:12.796 --> 01:17:15.198
YOU CHOOSE.
OR I'LL DO IT FOR YOU.

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:16.632
OH, GOD.

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:24.073
WONDER WHAT KIND
OF DOGS HE HAS.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:08.617
JESUS.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.286
IT'S ABOUT TIME.

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.858
I GUESS THIS IS IT.

01:18:14.924 --> 01:18:16.325
WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

01:18:17.493 --> 01:18:20.596
HELL WOULD BE A FAIR GUESS.

01:18:20.663 --> 01:18:22.999
(man)
WHEN I OPEN THIS DOOR,
COME OUTSIDE.

01:18:23.066 --> 01:18:24.233
GET OUT OF THERE.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.936
(Z Bob)
TAKE IT EASY, MAN.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:28.271
(Ash)
OK, I'M GETTING OUT.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:29.572
TAKE THIS OFF.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:30.940
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.608
[groaning]
SHUT YOUR HOLE.

01:18:32.675 --> 01:18:34.110
(Eli)
FOR THE RECORD,
WE'VE ALREADY SEEN YOUR FACES

01:18:34.177 --> 01:18:35.979
SO THE HOODS ARE KIND
OF POINTLESS, RIGHT?

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:38.581
WE'RE NOT GONNA KILL YOU.
WE'RE JUST GONNA WATCH.

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:40.283
(Z Bob)
DUDE, YOU LIKE TO WATCH?
I LOVE TO WATCH.

01:18:40.349 --> 01:18:42.218
THAT MEANS WE TOTALLY HAVE
SO MUCH IN COMMON.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:43.519
THE MORE YOU OPEN YOUR MOUTH,

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:45.188
THE LONGER
I'LL MAKE YOU SUFFER.

01:18:46.055 --> 01:18:47.290
(Eli)
ARE WE IN AN ELEVATOR?

01:18:47.356 --> 01:18:48.591
(Z Bob)
WE'RE GOING UP.

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.393
I DECIDED TO SEE IF
ONE OF YOU COULD FLY.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.495
(Nathan)
THAT WASN'T
ONE OF THE CHOICES.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.763
CHANGED MY MIND.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:55.098
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.866
UNCUFF ME AND FIND OUT.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:58.601
IS THAT SO,
BACHELOR BOY?

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.870
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.471
LET'S FIND OUT.

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:05.074
(Eli)
OH, SHIT.

01:19:08.611 --> 01:19:10.379

COME ON,
TAKE THIS FUCKING HOOD OFF.

[boys yelling]

01:19:11.547 --> 01:19:12.782
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

01:19:55.258 --> 01:19:58.094
ABSOLUTE FUCKING GENIUS!

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.650
I KNEW IT. I DID.
NO, THIS IS AWESOME.

01:20:36.132 --> 01:20:38.001
THAT'S INSANE.
JAIME PRESSLY'S HERE.

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:49.212
GENTLEMEN.

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:51.280
MY REAL NAME IS MR. KIDD.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.484
WELCOME TO NATHAN'S
BACHELOR PARTY WEEKEND.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.586
YOU ARE NOW PART

01:20:57.653 --> 01:21:01.757
OF ONE OF
THE LONGEST-RUNNING SECRETS
IN THE HISTORY OF LAS VEGAS.

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:04.260
THE FIRST THING YOU
SHOULD KNOW IS THAT

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:06.762
NONE OF YOU WERE EVER
IN ANY REAL DANGER.

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.364
NO ONE ACTUALLY DIED.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.599
NO ONE WAS EVER EVEN HURT.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.969
ME OR SOMEONE
FROM OUR STAFF WAS

01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:15.771
IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION
WITH EVERYONE

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:18.274
YOU ENCOUNTERED
ALONG THE WAY.

01:21:18.341 --> 01:21:21.710
THE 2ND IS A MESSAGE
FROM Z BOB'S BROTHER.

01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:23.279
AND IT READS...

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:29.185
HOW WAS WAYNE NEWTON,
BY THE WAY?

01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:31.988
"WE CAN ONLY HOPE
YOU ENJOYED YOURSELVES
AS MUCH AS WE DID

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:34.057
"WHEN WE WERE IN YOUR SHOES.

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:36.259
"EACH OF YOU IS
NOW ONE OF US.

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:40.763
"FOR THE SAKE OF
THOSE WHO WILL FOLLOW,
PLEASE NEVER FORGET

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.431
COMMANDMENT NUMBER ONE."

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:44.000
THANK YOU.

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:45.368
I KNOW.
(Ash)
Z?

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:46.936
(Z Bob)
YEAH?
YO.

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:49.939
YOUR BROTHERS ARE COOL.
I TAKE IT BACK.
THEY'RE COOL.

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.841
EVERY BACHELOR PARTY
THAT I ORCHESTRATE
IS DIFFERENT.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:56.145
BUT WE COULD NOT DO IT
WITHOUT THE FULL COOPERATION

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:58.114
OF THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF LAS VEGAS

01:21:58.181 --> 01:22:00.916
AND MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,
THE MAYOR.

01:22:03.686 --> 01:22:07.923
WHILE EVERY ADVENTURE
IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER,
THE POINT IS ALWAYS THE SAME.

01:22:07.991 --> 01:22:11.094
YOUNG MEN COME HERE,
THINKING THAT
A BACHELOR PARTY WEEKEND

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.529
IS ALL ABOUT PUSHING
THE BOUNDS OF DECENCY

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.731
AND STRETCHING
THEIR MORAL CODES.

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.233
AND WHILE IT IS,

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.503
WHAT IT REALLY IS ABOUT,
IS FRIENDSHIP.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.705
THE FRIENDSHIP
AMONG THE 5 OF YOU,

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.373
THE BONDS
THAT YOU HAVE FORGED,

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:26.542
THAT YOU ARE SO WORRIED
THAT WILL CHANGE

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.544
NOW THAT ONE OF YOU
IS GETTING MARRIED.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:31.114
AND THE REALITY IS,
THE BONDS WILL CHANGE.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.748
THAT'S LIFE.

01:22:32.815 --> 01:22:35.251
A WEDDING IS
WHEN A FATHER GIVES
AWAY HIS DAUGHTER.

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:36.952
BUT A BACHELOR PARTY

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:40.623
IS WHEN A GROUP OF GUYS
GIVE AWAY THEIR BEST FRIEND.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:44.793
WELL, NOW YOU CAN,
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SHARED
ONE FINAL ADVENTURE.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.996
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:51.134
BECAUSE YOU
HAVE ALREADY SHARED
THE GREATEST THING THERE IS.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.568
FRIENDSHIP.

01:22:58.774 --> 01:23:00.543
LET ME REMIND YOU THAT,
OFFICIALLY,

01:23:00.609 --> 01:23:02.578
THE MAIN EVENT HAS
NOT EVEN STARTED YET.

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:05.848
YOU STILL HAVE
A PARTY TO ATTEND,
WHICH WILL BEGIN SHORTLY

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.916
AS SOON AS YOUR
FRIENDS ARRIVE.
ALL RIGHT.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.753
FOR NOW, I SUGGEST YOU GUYS
GO TAKE A SHOWER.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.521
TRUST ME, YOU NEED IT.

01:23:12.588 --> 01:23:14.823
WHEN YOU RETURN, JOHNNY C...
HUH?

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:17.326
...PRIME RIB,
MASHED POTATOES, GRAVY.
OH.

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:18.594
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:21.697

COOKIE-DOUGH ICE CREAM.

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:25.000
ELI, SHRIMP COCKTAIL.
ALL YOU DESIRE.

01:23:25.068 --> 01:23:27.070
AND Z BOB,
GUESS WHAT I GOT FOR YOU.

01:23:27.136 --> 01:23:28.404
WHAT?

HERE THE WHOLE TIME?

01:24:49.752 --> 01:24:51.086
WHAT?

01:24:51.954 --> 01:24:53.422
THIS CAMERA.

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:54.923
WHAT CAMERA?

01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:08.003
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:09.205
ALL RIGHT.

01:25:43.706 --> 01:25:45.774
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:49.077
[laughing]
TO WATCH ME DO TO HER FIRST?

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:51.814
VERY GRACEFUL.
THOSE DANCE LESSONS
ARE REALLY PAYING OFF.

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.249
I JUST, UM...

01:25:53.316 --> 01:25:55.551
