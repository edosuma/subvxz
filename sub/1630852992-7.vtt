00:08.383 --> 00:11.053
Dear sisters and brothers.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.764
On the 9th of October 2012,

00:14.681 --> 00:19.144
the Taliban shot me
on the left side of my forehead.

00:21.563 --> 00:25.275
The terrorist thought that
they would stop my ambitions,

00:25.359 --> 00:28.612
but nothing changed
in my life except this:

00:29.780 --> 00:34.409
Weakness, fear and hopelessness died.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.871
Strength, power and courage was born.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.587
I have never been angry
at the guy who fired the bullet.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.550
And for me, like, you know,
even if I think about revenge,

00:49.633 --> 00:52.803
the best revenge is to promote education.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.222
- Dear Malala…
- Dear Malala…

00:55.305 --> 00:56.682
Dear Malala…

00:56.765 --> 00:59.768
You are an inspiration to us all.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.855
I'm not fighting against a terrorist.

01:02.938 --> 01:05.899
I'm fighting against
the ideology of terrorism and extremism

01:05.983 --> 01:07.609
through education.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.070
And now it's not just me,

01:10.153 --> 01:13.991
but it's so many people around the world
who are speaking out

01:14.074 --> 01:16.368
and things have changed.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.830
But for me, the fight is still on,
and it will continue

01:19.913 --> 01:24.168
till the day when every child has
access to safe and quality education.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.711
Dear Malala…

01:55.449 --> 01:59.077
My father had decided my name
before I was born.

01:59.161 --> 02:02.789
And he decided to name me
after Malalai of Maiwand

02:02.873 --> 02:06.668
who is this Afghan heroine,
and she participated in

02:06.752 --> 02:10.130
the Second Anglo-Afghan War
in the late 1800s.

02:10.964 --> 02:16.220
And my father wanted to name me after her
because she was known by her own name.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.014
Most of the times in our culture,

02:19.097 --> 02:24.061
women are referred to as "this man's wife,
this man's daughter, this man's mother,"

02:24.144 --> 02:26.647
and my father wanted me
to have my own identity,

02:26.730 --> 02:28.732
to have my own name, to be able to speak.

02:29.816 --> 02:34.655
My father became a feminist
before he even knew the word "feminism."

02:37.950 --> 02:40.244
I grew up in Swat Valley.
That's where I was born.

02:41.662 --> 02:45.999
It is a beautiful valley surrounded
by mountains in the north of Pakistan.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.128
That region, it's known as
the "Switzerland of the East."

02:51.004 --> 02:54.967
A lot of people used to visit, you know,
this, sort of, tourist spot.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.134
And it's just beautiful.

02:56.218 --> 02:59.346
You are living in this cradle of nature

02:59.429 --> 03:02.349
and it's-- it's incredible.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.020
I have a very long connection to schools.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.481
After my dad finished his master's

03:09.565 --> 03:12.442
and he was figuring out
what to do for a job,

03:12.526 --> 03:15.988
he always wanted to become a teacher.
That was his passion.

03:16.822 --> 03:20.200
He started a school.
And the school he started

03:20.284 --> 03:24.538
was right next to our house
so I, sort of, grew up in that school.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.665
Sometimes when I was, like,
literally a toddler,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.543
my mom would take me
downstairs to the school areas,

03:29.626 --> 03:32.421
and I would, sort of in my own language,

03:32.504 --> 03:35.174
try to give lectures
to the empty classrooms.

03:35.757 --> 03:40.095
I was the first child in my family
who started her education,

03:40.179 --> 03:43.473
and I was sort of
a nerdy student initially.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.435
I always used to get, you know,
ten out of ten in my tests,

03:46.518 --> 03:49.605
and always used to get
the first position in the class.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.774
And I really enjoyed learning new things.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.777
But for me,
I feel like my childhood was very short.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.906
And I think at age ten was
when things changed in Swat Valley.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.911
You know, there was this group of men,

04:03.994 --> 04:07.080
and then they started preaching
on local radios,

04:07.164 --> 04:09.082
and they called themselves the Taliban.

04:09.166 --> 04:13.587
And they said that, like, you know,
they want to implement their Islamic laws,

04:13.670 --> 04:15.214
and they want to change the system.

04:15.297 --> 04:20.260
And they believe that only the men,
as in them, should be making decisions.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.932
In the Taliban system,
there was no place for women.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.934
They literally changed everything.

04:27.017 --> 04:30.646
Like, they changed police stations
to Taliban stations.

04:30.729 --> 04:34.942
They started their own courts,
and we would see Taliban on the streets.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.820
If you were traveling somewhere,
they would stop your car with huge guns,

04:38.904 --> 04:42.991
and they would ask you
if you had any cassettes,

04:43.075 --> 04:45.827
any music CDs or anything,

04:45.911 --> 04:47.371
because they were against music.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.414
And then they would also check

04:49.498 --> 04:53.001
if the women were covering
their faces properly or not.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.838
And even I would get so scared
that I would cover my face.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.675
So that was the life
during Talibanization.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.847
Things changed for me
when they banned girls' education.

05:05.472 --> 05:09.059
They announced that
on the 15th of January 2009,

05:09.142 --> 05:11.520
girls' education will be
completely banned.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.864
More than 400 schools were destroyed.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.949
Many girls were flogged.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.035
There would be curfews.

05:27.119 --> 05:30.330
And that was the first time
that I realized, like, what it was.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.790
I was like, "What is a curfew?"

05:32.749 --> 05:35.544
And I remind people
that education is crucial.

05:35.627 --> 05:38.797
Education is crucial
for the empowerment of women

05:38.881 --> 05:41.592
that even the Taliban recognized it.

05:41.675 --> 05:45.012
And they knew that if they did not want
to see women being empowered,

05:45.095 --> 05:47.389
they had to deprive them of education.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.726
When girls' education was banned,

05:50.809 --> 05:55.272
that was the time when I felt that
my future was taken away from me.

05:56.899 --> 06:00.027
I was sitting at home,
and there was nobody to teach me.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.364
I just could not imagine
that future for myself

06:04.448 --> 06:06.074
that many girls had already seen

06:06.158 --> 06:09.953
where they're forced into
early child marriages, child labor,

06:10.037 --> 06:13.999
or into other unrecognized work,
unpaid work,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.126
and they're told that
that is their life now.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.963
And I did not want to see
that future for myself

06:20.047 --> 06:23.300
where I also lose my sense of identity.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.304
So I think that's when I decided that,
you know,

06:27.387 --> 06:32.851
that we have to continue fighting
for truth, human rights and dignity.

06:33.769 --> 06:38.315
So I started speaking to local
and national televisions and newspapers.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.318
I will be a social activist till my death.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.822
And my father and I, we were marching
and participating in different protests

06:45.906 --> 06:49.243
to raise attention and to remind
our government to take action.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.704
I also volunteered to participate,

06:52.788 --> 06:55.582
you know, in New York Times,
in this documentary.

06:55.666 --> 06:59.461
And I decided to, like,
share my voice and share my story.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.353
The Taliban, they believe in using force.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.981
But I was more worried about my dad.
I thought, you know,

07:19.064 --> 07:21.149
the Taliban might have
some level of sympathy

07:21.233 --> 07:24.778
that they would not attack a child,
but, you know, I was wrong.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.406
But they just got scared of

07:27.489 --> 07:30.909
an individual who had
nothing but her voice.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.879
Dear Malala, I'm from New York City,
and I'm 13 years old.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.798
I've always loved learning,
and I used to assume

07:44.882 --> 07:48.510
that kids all over the world went to
school every day just like I did.

07:49.386 --> 07:53.724
But then, one day in second grade,
I found this book in the library.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.767
It was a picture book about you.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.397
This is when I first started learning
about your fight for girls' education.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.065
I thought you were so brave.

08:02.149 --> 08:05.235
After everything you went through,
you just came back stronger.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.529
"I was especially drawn to your story

08:07.613 --> 08:10.574
because you started your activism
when you were so young."

08:10.657 --> 08:12.492
So, later that year,

08:12.576 --> 08:14.745
when my class did this project
where we each picked

08:14.828 --> 08:17.122
a different influential figure
to research,

08:17.664 --> 08:19.416
I chose you.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.127
As I read more about your story,

08:22.211 --> 08:26.089
I learned that 130 million girls
around the world are not in school.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.218
And if all of those girls made up
a single country,

08:29.301 --> 08:31.595
it would be the 10th
most populated country in the world.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.097
I was just like, "Wow."
It was honestly shocking

08:35.182 --> 08:39.311
to imagine so many girls not being
able to do something that I do every day.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.355
And the reasoning behind it,

08:41.438 --> 08:44.858
gender discrimination,
was especially disturbing to me.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.321
Our projects ended
with a wax museum presentation

08:49.404 --> 08:52.199
where we all dressed up
like the people who had researched.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.909
And after everything I'd learned,

08:53.992 --> 08:56.828
I wanted to do more than
just dress up like you.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.998
You inspired me to become
an education activist myself.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.001
At the time, I was only seven years old,

09:03.085 --> 09:05.462
and I didn't know
what to do or how to help.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.382
But I kept thinking about you
and how you said,

09:08.465 --> 09:12.719
"One child, one teacher, one book
and one pen can change the world."

09:12.803 --> 09:17.182
I thought, "If Malala could do so much
at a young age, maybe I can too."

09:17.266 --> 09:20.602
"My dad helped me
reach out to the Malala Fund.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.272
It literally changed my life."

09:24.106 --> 09:26.441
"I talked with the organizers
and activists,

09:26.525 --> 09:30.195
and I learned that
no fundraising effort is too small."

09:30.279 --> 09:33.574
So I decided to organize something myself.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.784
The first thing I did was start
a fundraising page

09:35.868 --> 09:37.536
to support your foundation.

09:37.619 --> 09:41.582
Then the summer after fourth grade,
I started holding lemonade stands.

09:41.665 --> 09:44.918
My sister Aisha and I gave out information
about your foundation

09:45.002 --> 09:47.212
and its work to promote
girls' education worldwide.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.133
From there,
I started organizing more and more.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.887
I put together bake sales,
clothing drives and birthday donations.

09:56.388 --> 09:59.558
I write for Assembly,
Malala Fund's digital newsletter.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.477
And I partnered with them to make
a series of short videos

10:02.561 --> 10:04.563
to inspire other people to donate.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.191
"Young people have strong voices,

10:07.274 --> 10:10.694
and it's never too early for us
to start using them."

10:10.777 --> 10:13.155
Girls' education is just so important.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.783
Every girl throughout the world deserves
the opportunity to go to school

10:16.867 --> 10:19.828
and study whatever she wants to
just like I can.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.957
Malala, I'm so grateful to you
for showing me

10:24.041 --> 10:26.960
that you can be a changemaker
no matter how old you are.

10:35.427 --> 10:40.599
The Taliban terrorism
in Swat Valley was from 2007 till 2009.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.103
During that time, schools were bombed,

10:45.187 --> 10:48.315
and government officials
and police officials were killed.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.068
Activists who were
speaking out were killed,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.529
and you would hear, sort of,
fighting all the time.

10:54.655 --> 10:58.033
Pakistani soldiers
head deep into the Swat Valley.

10:58.825 --> 11:03.247
The military is waging a major offensive
to try and eliminate Islamist militants.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.252
The military had come
to Swat Valley to fight the Taliban.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.631
And we, the people of Swat,
had to leave our own homes

11:12.714 --> 11:15.092
in order to reduce civilian casualties.

11:15.592 --> 11:18.804
This picturesque valley
was torn up by panic.

11:18.887 --> 11:23.809
An estimated 200,000 fleeing
the army's advance against the militants.

11:24.852 --> 11:28.230
There were so many people
on the roads without shoes,

11:28.313 --> 11:30.816
with a few bags of clothes in their hands,

11:30.899 --> 11:33.110
and they just did not know
where they were going.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.029
And that was one of
the most difficult times

11:36.113 --> 11:39.241
because we just did not know
for how long it was gonna last

11:39.324 --> 11:42.077
or if we were ever gonna see
Swat Valley again.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.415
And what happens is
that you start questioning your identity

11:46.498 --> 11:49.710
and, like, what is the place
that you can call home now.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.922
It is that dilemma

11:54.006 --> 11:57.843
to decide whether you want to build
a new home in a new place

11:57.926 --> 11:59.887
or whether you want to go back
to your home.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.474
Here the Pakistani army
is taking on the Taliban

12:04.558 --> 12:06.935
and, for the first time in years, winning.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.647
We were glad that
we were able to go back to Swat Valley

12:10.731 --> 12:12.232
after three months.

12:12.316 --> 12:18.322
But it takes so long to restore
a place from conflict

12:18.405 --> 12:21.867
because so many buildings
and places are just bombed and destroyed.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.704
And there are literally bullets,
you know, in every wall.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.915
Even our school was used
as an army bunker.

12:29.750 --> 12:33.629
But that is the reality of living in war,
living in a conflict.

12:35.589 --> 12:39.218
So we were in that period
of sort of recovering from it.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.845
My Pakistan is a very peaceful Pakistan.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.764
And we all know
that war is not a good thing,

12:43.847 --> 12:47.476
and we all know
the importance of peace.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.896
The Taliban targeted me
just because of the fear

12:50.979 --> 12:55.734
that I and my dad, you know,
were speaking the truth.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.819
And they saw us as a threat.

12:58.529 --> 13:03.367
And then, as soon as, like, you know,
I was 15, I was attacked on my school bus.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.163
I had my school exams on that day.

13:10.541 --> 13:14.211
And school finished a bit earlier
because of examinations,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.839
and I did quite well.
So, I was happy with my performance.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.760
And I was talking to my friends,
and we got into our school bus.

13:21.844 --> 13:25.514
And there were like, I don't know,
20-something of us in their school bus.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.475
Like, in Pakistan,
you can fit in as many people as you want.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.728
And then the driver started driving.

13:31.812 --> 13:32.813
And…

13:34.189 --> 13:35.941
then I don't remember anything.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.820
Everything just goes blank.

13:43.282 --> 13:46.201
I just remember waking up
in a hospital in Birmingham.

13:47.411 --> 13:51.331
So, for me, the story is, like,
very short, based on what I remember.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.502
But then I also asked my best friend,
like, what happened on that day.

13:55.586 --> 13:56.837
And she said that

13:56.920 --> 14:00.007
a guy was talking at the front
to the driver to keep him busy.

14:00.090 --> 14:04.094
And this one guy was at the back,
and he asked, like, "Who is Malala?"

14:04.178 --> 14:07.639
And that then
the guy sort of fired some bullets,

14:07.723 --> 14:10.434
and one bullet hit me on my forehead.

14:13.061 --> 14:15.731
And I was curious. Did I even say a word?

14:15.814 --> 14:21.236
And my friend was like, "No. Like,
you were completely quiet and still."

14:21.320 --> 14:23.197
And that I was holding her hand,

14:23.280 --> 14:25.157
and I squeezed it, like, so tight

14:25.240 --> 14:28.327
that she felt the pain
for many, many days.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.787
And then I fell in her lap.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.539
And sort of there was, you know, blood,

14:32.623 --> 14:34.208
you know, everywhere in the school bus.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.753
And the driver-- as soon as he, like,
realized this had happened,

14:37.836 --> 14:41.673
he, you know, drove the school van
straight to a hospital.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.802
The doctors then figured out that

14:45.886 --> 14:49.640
the bullet went straight down
through my neck into my back.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.225
And the bullet got stuck in there.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.394
It also completely destroyed my eardrum

14:54.478 --> 14:57.439
and also my facial nerve
for the left side.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.777
I was flown from one hospital
to another for a week.

15:02.361 --> 15:05.864
Then, because my other organs
in the body were, like, literally failing,

15:05.948 --> 15:07.699
that's when I was moved to the UK.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.830
With her family by her side,
she was flown out of Rawalpindi

15:13.914 --> 15:16.291
in a specially equipped medical plane.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.669
She will now be treated
at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital

15:18.752 --> 15:20.212
in Birmingham, Britain

15:20.295 --> 15:24.508
to repair and replace
some of the bones in her shattered skull.

15:25.217 --> 15:29.304
The bullet had been, you know,
a centimeter closer, like,

15:29.388 --> 15:31.431
you know, things would have been
completely different.

15:31.515 --> 15:34.893
So, it's just a miracle.
You're like, how did I survive?

15:45.362 --> 15:47.281
Dear Malala,

15:47.364 --> 15:50.617
You never take for granted
the power of your voice…

15:50.701 --> 15:55.122
"…and you're not afraid to wield it.
Even when it puts you in danger."

15:55.205 --> 15:57.833
My name is Fatimata.

15:57.916 --> 16:02.296
I am a first-generation college student
and environmental activist.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.882
I grew up in the South Bronx.

16:04.965 --> 16:08.635
As a child, my father would take me
on so many trips to the park.

16:09.511 --> 16:12.848
And pretty early on, I noticed that
my neighborhood was subject

16:12.931 --> 16:16.768
to environmental inequality,
high levels of air pollution…

16:16.852 --> 16:20.189
"…lack of sanitation,
and dilapidated buildings."

16:20.272 --> 16:24.109
I began wondering if the lack of care
for these neighborhoods

16:24.193 --> 16:27.529
has something to do with
the color of their inhabitants.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.617
I was a pretty outspoken
middle school student.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.203
I was constantly speaking up
about the injustice,

16:34.912 --> 16:38.415
organizing protests,
and I even wrote a letter to the mayor.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.876
On the last day of school,

16:40.959 --> 16:43.962
one of my classmates signed my yearbook,
saying that I was going to be…

16:44.046 --> 16:46.465
"…was going to be
the next Malala Yousafzai.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.592
I was completely floored."

16:49.510 --> 16:52.387
My parents are Senegalese-Gambian,

16:52.471 --> 16:55.182
and they brought
a great deal of their culture with them

16:55.265 --> 16:57.142
when they immigrated to the US.

16:57.726 --> 17:03.649
And although my parents encourage me,
many of the men in my community do not.

17:03.732 --> 17:07.444
I've been told things like,
"You shouldn't be in college.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.780
And your place is at home in the kitchen."

17:10.739 --> 17:13.157
But I'm not the least bit discouraged.

17:13.242 --> 17:18.704
Being one of the few Muslim women
I see speaking out for climate justice,

17:18.789 --> 17:23.210
I have made it my duty to fight
the stereotypes and hold my ground.

17:23.292 --> 17:28.173
"All people should be allowed to pursue
their purpose regardless of gender."

17:28.257 --> 17:32.261
And I'm holding my ground
until I see the change I want to happen.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.348
I have organized
against environmental inequality

17:36.431 --> 17:39.685
by interning with the district campaign
in the South Bronx.

17:40.811 --> 17:44.481
Recently, I learned of the plan
to cut the district sanitation budget.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.651
Anticipating the detrimental impact
that would have,

17:47.734 --> 17:51.154
I helped set initiatives in place
which will fill in the gap.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.866
And I have you to thank for that, Malala.

17:53.949 --> 17:57.160
"You helped change the mindset
of a generation of people

17:57.244 --> 18:01.999
and the perception of Muslim women
because of your courage and selflessness."

18:02.082 --> 18:03.083
My native…

18:03.166 --> 18:06.712
Hopefully, I can make an impact
on environmental injustice

18:06.795 --> 18:12.009
and be an inspiration to young Muslim
women around the world. Just like you.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.268
Doctors say the bullet grazed her brain.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.938
Just a tiny difference in the
bullet's trajectory would've been fatal.

18:25.022 --> 18:29.484
Instead, she now seems on
the long road to recovery.

18:29.568 --> 18:34.031
When I woke up in a hospital
in Birmingham, I asked two questions.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.867
My first question was,
"Where's my father?"

18:36.950 --> 18:40.078
And my second question was,
"Who's gonna pay for this?

18:40.162 --> 18:43.165
I do not have money
to afford my hospital bills."

18:44.374 --> 18:46.460
I was quite pragmatic.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.963
I'm feeling all right,
and I'm happy that the operations--

18:50.047 --> 18:52.841
both the operations are successful.

18:52.925 --> 18:56.386
Well, my parents, you know--
they visited me after ten days.

18:56.470 --> 18:59.264
And that was the first time that I cried.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.517
I had not cried before that.

19:02.601 --> 19:06.772
And that was also when they saw,
you know, the new me.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.400
In a way, it's like you're reborn.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.696
My voice changed,
and I was speaking much slower.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.740
And I could not walk initially.

19:17.533 --> 19:20.160
I had to learn to do everything again.

19:20.244 --> 19:24.831
It was like that whole period
of childhood and growth coming back.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.834
Literally felt like a new life.

19:28.544 --> 19:33.006
But I recovered very quickly,
and that made me feel empowered.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.636
Because you realize that
you have literally survived

19:37.719 --> 19:40.264
a bullet going this close to your brain.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.725
And you are alive.
And you are just grateful that you have--

19:43.809 --> 19:46.228
you have a chance to, sort of, live again.

19:46.311 --> 19:47.646
Live for another life.

19:50.232 --> 19:54.111
After this incident,
my faith strengthened,

19:54.194 --> 19:57.739
and I realized that
if you are on the right path,

19:57.823 --> 20:00.742
and if you are fighting for truth

20:00.826 --> 20:04.413
and fighting for, you know,
human rights and dignity,

20:04.496 --> 20:07.040
then there is that force
of nature with you.

20:07.124 --> 20:10.961
I want every girl,
every child to be educated.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.173
And for that reason,
we have organized Malala Fund.

20:14.756 --> 20:17.134
She announced an education fund

20:17.217 --> 20:20.971
that will start by sending girls
to school in Pakistan.

20:21.054 --> 20:25.392
And let us turn the education
of 40 girls into 40 million girls.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.814
Many have rallied to her cause:
education for girls.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.691
Because girls' education is related

20:32.774 --> 20:37.237
to issues like gender equality,
reducing poverty,

20:37.321 --> 20:41.241
you know, ethnic cleansing
and genocides and wars and conflicts.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.579
And the Islam that I understand says that,

20:45.662 --> 20:48.207
you know,
women should be treated as humans.

20:49.625 --> 20:53.962
I believe that there is room
for feminism and equality in Islam.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.341
The girl who once wanted to be a doctor

20:57.424 --> 21:00.552
now wants to be a world leader.

21:00.636 --> 21:04.097
Let us pick up our books and our pens.

21:04.181 --> 21:07.100
They are our most powerful weapons.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.730
What is crucial is doing work together

21:11.813 --> 21:14.942
and recognizing how we are
collectively helping

21:15.025 --> 21:16.902
the bigger cause that we are fighting for.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.570
The president and first lady

21:18.654 --> 21:21.740
invited Malala Yousafzai
to the Oval Office.

21:21.823 --> 21:26.703
For bravely lending your voice to so many,
we thank you.

21:26.787 --> 21:30.832
And especially in this country as well,
I have heard about many children

21:30.916 --> 21:32.417
that cannot go to school.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.295
So, I hope we can continue
our work with empowerment.

21:35.379 --> 21:36.380
That's wonderful.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.675
We need to play a responsible role

21:39.758 --> 21:42.886
in pushing our leaders
to make more responsible decisions.

21:42.970 --> 21:48.517
And make decisions that can ensure equity,
equality and inclusivity in our society.

21:48.600 --> 21:52.062
And I believe that there is no difference
between a man and a woman.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.940
I even believe that a woman
is more powerful than man.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.024
What? Wait.

21:56.108 --> 21:58.110
Wait. What? What?

21:58.193 --> 22:00.612
We should not
take investment in education,

22:00.696 --> 22:02.364
investment in learning,

22:02.447 --> 22:05.158
investment in technology
and knowledge for granted.

22:05.242 --> 22:06.910
These are crucial--

22:06.994 --> 22:09.538
these will define the future
of our countries.

22:10.289 --> 22:13.292
My dream is to work for education.

22:13.375 --> 22:18.422
To see every child going to school,
getting quality education.

22:18.505 --> 22:22.968
And I dream for a bright future,
for a better world. Thank you.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.014
Thank you.

22:36.398 --> 22:37.774
Dear Malala,

22:38.400 --> 22:41.486
When I was born in Syria,
it was a peaceful place.

22:42.154 --> 22:46.491
But in 2011, war broke out in my country.

22:49.036 --> 22:51.872
There was no safety, no peace.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.541
We lived under siege for two years

22:54.625 --> 22:59.421
before my family made the difficult
decision to flee our beloved homeland.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.675
Just as you and your family fled yours.

23:04.676 --> 23:08.138
"When we arrived at
the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan,

23:08.222 --> 23:10.641
we were so grateful to have shelter.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.477
But the transition was shocking."

23:13.560 --> 23:17.397
We were living in a tent
with no furniture or electricity.

23:17.481 --> 23:21.276
"And we had to walk
a very long way for water.

23:22.110 --> 23:25.697
There was one bright spot
for me in all of this."

23:26.281 --> 23:27.866
The camp had a school.

23:28.575 --> 23:34.248
But my first day I couldn't understand
why the class was so empty.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.334
A few girls my age told me
their parents believed…

23:37.417 --> 23:41.839
"…their parents believed marriage was
the best future for their daughters.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.966
I know this wasn't right…"

23:45.092 --> 23:49.012
…and I wasn't going to
let my circumstances defeat me.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.931
I wanted to make a change.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.602
So, I started telling girls
we can choose anything,

23:55.686 --> 23:57.312
but before we get married…

23:57.396 --> 24:00.566
"…we must first get an education."

24:01.441 --> 24:03.110
I went from tent to tent,

24:03.193 --> 24:06.363
encouraging parents
to educate their daughters

24:06.446 --> 24:08.991
rather than marry them off.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.410
And when you speak from your heart…

24:11.493 --> 24:13.829
"…it calls to the hearts of others."

24:13.912 --> 24:16.748
So they started listening to me.

24:16.832 --> 24:18.625
"But after a year of advocacy work,

24:18.709 --> 24:22.379
I became discouraged by
the uncertainty of life in the camp."

24:22.462 --> 24:26.592
It was around this time
that you came to Zaatari.

24:28.343 --> 24:31.889
It is my responsibility
and our responsibility

24:31.972 --> 24:35.309
to go and tell the world
what is happening here.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.394
When I met you, I thought,

24:37.477 --> 24:42.024
"This is the most remarkable young person
I have ever known in my life."

24:42.107 --> 24:44.526
And you and I had so much in common.

24:46.153 --> 24:51.366
My father is also a teacher,
and we both have struggled in our lives.

24:51.867 --> 24:54.578
"Malala, you became such an inspiration.

24:54.661 --> 24:58.498
You helped me remember that
I didn't choose to become a refugee.

24:58.582 --> 24:59.791
None of us did."

24:59.875 --> 25:03.921
But I could choose
how I would face these challenges.

25:04.004 --> 25:07.216
"I pressed on with my advocacy
within the camps,

25:07.299 --> 25:11.637
and in 2015,
my family and I settled in the UK."

25:12.304 --> 25:14.306
I continued to speak,

25:14.389 --> 25:18.352
and I have helped many girls
realize their own dreams of an education.

25:19.853 --> 25:25.484
Now I have returned to Jordan
to speak with other Syrian refugees there.

25:28.028 --> 25:32.241
I became a UNICEF goodwill ambassador
at the age of 19.

25:32.324 --> 25:35.160
Education is the lifeline
which can help them

25:35.244 --> 25:37.746
and protect them of--
so many problems such as--

25:37.829 --> 25:41.375
It has given me hope
to someday return to Syria…

25:41.458 --> 25:44.336
"…with a strong, educated young generation

25:44.419 --> 25:46.255
who can rebuild our country."

25:47.589 --> 25:52.052
My story is the story
of millions who are voiceless,

25:52.135 --> 25:54.513
and when I speak, I am them.

25:54.596 --> 25:59.434
Thank you, Malala.
You are an inspiration to us all.

26:05.274 --> 26:06.692
There was a lot of news,

26:06.775 --> 26:10.362
and things going on
about Nobel Peace Prize in 2013.

26:10.445 --> 26:11.989
And that year, I did not win.

26:12.072 --> 26:15.909
And I did not even expect to, like, win.
I just never thought I'll win it.

26:15.993 --> 26:20.122
But then the year after, in 2014,
again this thing started, like,

26:20.205 --> 26:23.208
"Malala is nominated,
and she might win again and--"

26:23.292 --> 26:26.920
We were told that the Nobel Prize
would make the announcement at 10:00 a.m.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.590
I just went to school.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.301
I'm like, "I'm not going to
listen to any announcement."

26:32.384 --> 26:33.927
So then it was 10:00 a.m.

26:34.011 --> 26:36.889
and, like, you sort of feel
like you should know by now,

26:36.972 --> 26:38.724
like, they would have called somebody.

26:38.807 --> 26:42.519
And I did not have
a mobile phone myself yet.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.354
And so, I just did not hear anything.

26:44.438 --> 26:46.982
And I was like,
"Okay, it's announced, and it's not me."

26:49.318 --> 26:53.405
And then my school's deputy head teacher
came into my classroom,

26:53.488 --> 26:55.199
and she called me.

26:55.282 --> 26:59.077
And I got worried because she always calls
you when you are in trouble.

26:59.161 --> 27:01.955
And she took me outside the class,
and she said,

27:02.039 --> 27:04.458
"Malala,
you have won the Nobel Peace Prize."

27:04.541 --> 27:06.627
And I was just in-- in a complete shock.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.754
I did not know what to say,
and I was like,

27:08.837 --> 27:11.632
"Thank you so much."
That's all I could say.

27:11.715 --> 27:15.636
And then, I decided that
I will go back to my classroom

27:15.719 --> 27:19.389
and enter my physics class because
I received a prize for education,

27:19.473 --> 27:21.016
so I cannot leave my education.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.809
I have to finish my school day.

27:22.893 --> 27:24.061
So, I finished my school day,

27:24.144 --> 27:25.938
and then I went,
and we did a press conference.

27:26.021 --> 27:29.441
This award is not just a piece of metal
or a medal that you would wear

27:29.525 --> 27:31.860
or an award
that you would keep in your room.

27:31.944 --> 27:36.198
But this is really an encouragement for me
to go forward and to believe in myself.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.574
To know that there are people--

27:37.658 --> 27:39.952
It would be
a crowning achievement at any age,

27:40.035 --> 27:42.996
but for a 17-year-old
to win the Nobel Peace Prize,

27:43.080 --> 27:46.792
that was completely unheard of,
that is until today.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.086
I felt like children received that prize.

27:49.169 --> 27:53.590
I felt that girls received that prize and
that I was receiving it on their behalf.

27:54.883 --> 28:00.639
Though I appear as one girl,
I'm not a lone voice. I am many.

28:01.598 --> 28:05.143
I am Malala, but I am also Shazia.

28:05.227 --> 28:08.188
I am Kainat. I am Muzoon.

28:09.147 --> 28:12.860
I am those girls
who are deprived of education.

28:14.778 --> 28:18.657
And today, I'm not raising my voice.

28:19.241 --> 28:21.326
It is the voice of those girls.

28:24.496 --> 28:27.916
Oftentimes children are told that they
have to grow older to change the world,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.418
and I completely disagree with that.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.672
Children see things
in a new way, in a different way.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.340
And they believe in change.

28:35.424 --> 28:37.676
They believe in all forms
of possibilities.

28:37.759 --> 28:42.264
And I hope to see more and more of them
make their dreams a reality.

28:42.347 --> 28:48.437
Let this be the last time
that we see a child out of school.

28:49.146 --> 28:51.106
Let this end with us.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.733
Thank you so much.

28:54.276 --> 28:55.360
Thank you.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.163
Dear Malala,

29:06.872 --> 29:10.417
My name is Ryann, and I'm a writer
and student concerned about human rights.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.336
I grew up in Los Angeles

29:12.419 --> 29:15.339
and became immersed
in the world of poetry in high school.

29:15.422 --> 29:19.593
My passion for poetry fueled my passion
to research topics thoroughly,

29:19.676 --> 29:22.846
and everything changed
when my research led me to you.

29:23.764 --> 29:26.600
When you were told what a woman is
and isn't supposed to do,

29:26.683 --> 29:28.727
you refused to accept it.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.563
I felt an instant kinship with you.

29:31.647 --> 29:34.358
"You have never
accepted inaction as an option.

29:34.441 --> 29:37.027
In a time of great need,
you risked your life

29:37.110 --> 29:40.155
and demonstrated the weight
of a single voice."

29:40.239 --> 29:43.575
You recognized when something
with the status quo wasn't working

29:43.659 --> 29:47.204
and took steps to disrupt the system
and make radical change.

29:47.913 --> 29:51.041
I am now a pre-law student
at American University.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.962
I was very active in my studies
and on-campus organizations,

29:55.045 --> 29:58.882
and then everything came to a halt
when the pandemic hit.

29:58.966 --> 30:02.970
As I navigated through quarantine,
I felt stagnant and powerless.

30:03.720 --> 30:07.641
It felt as if the very systems
that were in place to help and protect us

30:07.724 --> 30:10.602
were failing us
in our time of greatest need.

30:11.353 --> 30:13.814
In that moment, I thought of you, Malala,

30:13.897 --> 30:16.358
and one of the most important
life lessons you taught me.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.319
"When you are told
there's nothing you can do,

30:19.403 --> 30:21.822
there's usually something you can do.

30:21.905 --> 30:26.410
So, I decided I would take matters
into my own hands

30:26.493 --> 30:29.371
and help get resources to people."

30:29.454 --> 30:31.206
I started off small.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.083
I did some research and compiled the names

30:33.166 --> 30:36.420
of a few financial resources
available to California residents

30:36.503 --> 30:39.131
and put them into
an online open-source doc.

30:39.715 --> 30:43.427
I posted the doc on my Twitter and asked
people to add any information they had.

30:43.510 --> 30:47.681
And I never would have imagined
what I would wake up to the next morning.

30:47.764 --> 30:51.727
My two-page doc had become
a 20-page extensive amassment

30:51.810 --> 30:55.063
of information and resources
added by people from all over the world.

30:56.106 --> 30:57.441
The document went viral

30:57.524 --> 31:00.736
and continued to grow as it circulated
and more communities added to it.

31:00.819 --> 31:01.945
And it didn't stop there.

31:02.654 --> 31:05.157
I was approached by Charles Reed,
a leader in the tech industry,

31:05.240 --> 31:09.077
who took an interest in my document
and wanted to help turn it into an app.

31:09.161 --> 31:10.787
Charles and I worked together

31:10.871 --> 31:14.374
to create a fully functional app called
the COVID-19 Resource App

31:14.458 --> 31:18.170
with hundreds of crowd-funded
and personally researched resources.

31:18.670 --> 31:20.339
Strange to think that I,

31:20.422 --> 31:23.884
a college student frustrated
with the conditions of a global tragedy,

31:23.967 --> 31:26.929
could do something that might galvanize
and unite my country…

31:27.012 --> 31:30.974
"…in a way that my very own government
failed to do at the time.

31:31.058 --> 31:33.727
I'm completely humbled by the experience.

31:33.810 --> 31:37.064
And in it all, I look to you, Malala."

31:37.147 --> 31:40.984
Your courage, strength, grace,
and wisdom continue

31:41.068 --> 31:44.238
to inspire a generation of people
to enact change

31:44.321 --> 31:46.532
and empower others to save themselves.

31:46.615 --> 31:49.326
May we both continue
to make an impact with our words

31:49.409 --> 31:51.828
and with our commitment
to serving our communities,

31:51.912 --> 31:54.331
both locally and in the world at large.

31:58.210 --> 32:01.088
There's this,
sort of this public picture of me,

32:01.171 --> 32:04.550
but I have not, like, changed at all.

32:05.884 --> 32:09.137
There is some part of you that--
that is so hard to define,

32:09.221 --> 32:11.014
but there is that self within you,

32:11.098 --> 32:16.186
and that part has been consistent
inside me for all these years.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.273
You know, I have graduated recently,

32:19.356 --> 32:24.653
and I want to make sure that I continue my
advocacy and my work for girls' education

32:24.736 --> 32:26.989
because if I don't do my part,

32:27.072 --> 32:31.118
and if everybody else don't do their part,
then things will remain the way they are.

32:31.201 --> 32:35.163
I am so grateful to you for
showing me no matter how young you are,

32:35.247 --> 32:36.915
you can always make a difference.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.959
Yours truly, Anya.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.961
Sincerely, Ryann.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.046
Sincerely, Fatimata.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.424
In solidarity, Muzoon.

32:45.507 --> 32:48.844
I hope that, I don't know,
50, 60 years later or something,

32:48.927 --> 32:51.722
you know,
when people talk about me, they'll say,

32:51.805 --> 32:55.934
"Remember that time when there
were 130 million girls out of school,

32:56.018 --> 32:57.227
how crazy was that?

32:57.311 --> 32:59.646
But that is no longer happening.

32:59.730 --> 33:02.566
And no girl is discriminated
from access to education,

33:02.649 --> 33:05.569
access to opportunities
because of our gender."

33:06.069 --> 33:07.905
I want to see this in my lifetime.

33:07.988 --> 33:11.617
I want to see this very soon,
and I will keep on fighting for it.
