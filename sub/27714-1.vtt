02:03.760 --> 02:04.876
<i>Quick. Pow, pow, pow.</i>

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
They're coming.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.679
No one gets past Electric Elie.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.314
Or me, Samurai Sam.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.278
Oh, no! An "in-surgeon"!

02:11.440 --> 02:12.794
Secure the gate!

02:12.920 --> 02:14.560
Okay, guys, send the commander
back to HQ.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.478
He still has three boxes
to unpack.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.736
He doesn't have time for boxes.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.319
Fort Bumblefoot
is taking fire.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.830
And stop calling Meribeth
an insurgent, okay?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.080
Pull back.

02:23.120 --> 02:24.873
Pull back. Pull back!

02:26.800 --> 02:29.031
Shh.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.913
Oh, sneak attack!

02:31.040 --> 02:32.554
Evacuate! Run!

02:32.680 --> 02:35.559
- Don't tear my sheets.
- Run. Run.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.880
Oh, I'm trapped.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.996
Save yourselves.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.873
No, don't come back
for 15 minutes!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.360
Tonya!

02:41.440 --> 02:44.399
Tonya!

02:44.560 --> 02:46.040
Tonya, open up.

02:46.160 --> 02:47.880
If you changed the locks
on our house again,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.117
- I swear, I'll...
- Really?

02:50.240 --> 02:51.936
This is what "I promise
to do better" looks like?

02:51.960 --> 02:53.189
Just let me in.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.874
You smell like a whiskey plant.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.276
Yeah, well, don't worry
about it, I'll sleep it off.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.596
You know I have your commander
on speed dial, right?

02:59.720 --> 03:03.760
So help me, Michael,
you could quit caring about me,

03:03.880 --> 03:05.553
but you better find a way
to be the man

03:05.680 --> 03:07.056
those girls in there
need you to be...

03:07.080 --> 03:09.470
no, deserve for you to be.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.833
Stupid.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.674
Gon' mind your own business?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.996
Yes.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.031
Well, we met the neighbors.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.480
<i>Tac unit nine,</i>

03:30.600 --> 03:32.034
<i>shots fired call.</i>

03:32.160 --> 03:34.311
<i>Lanier and Kennesaw.
Lanier and Kennesaw.</i>

03:34.480 --> 03:36.358
<i>Suspect believed to be
in the house.</i>

03:36.480 --> 03:39.917
Suspect mid-30s,
six-one, 200 pounds.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.076
We need one in the back!

03:50.640 --> 03:53.439
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

03:57.720 --> 03:59.359
All right, give me
your other hand.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.376
- Papi!
- You're gonna get up slowly.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.077
He just fell back to sleep.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.354
There's my girl.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.314
How you doing, sweetie? Huh?

04:44.440 --> 04:46.113
There's my girl.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.197
Hey, baby.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.436
Amanda, what you doing?

04:49.600 --> 04:50.875
You haven't heard?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.276
- Or seen the news?
- What's wrong?

04:53.400 --> 04:54.896
We're going to stay with my mom
and Herb in Savannah

04:54.920 --> 04:55.956
until you get back.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
What?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.600
...joining our newscast.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.949
It was announced

05:02.080 --> 05:03.833
a short time ago
that Fort Stewart

05:03.960 --> 05:05.838
will be deploying
more than 1,000...

05:05.960 --> 05:07.856
Baby, we don't even know
if that's my unit, all right?

05:07.880 --> 05:09.314
Julie and Amy
already called me.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.336
I just... I don't know
what I'm gonna do

05:12.360 --> 05:13.555
with her and with work

05:13.680 --> 05:14.816
- and nobody to watch her.
- Hey, hey.

05:14.840 --> 05:15.856
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.075
Hey, look at me.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.680
Slow down, baby.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.256
You don't have to worry
about a thing.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.475
You can stay here.

05:21.600 --> 05:23.478
Near the base,
near the other wives,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.080
the other kids.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.416
You're gonna have more
of what you need here

05:26.440 --> 05:28.159
than at your mom's.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.431
All right? Trust me.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.176
<i>So I've committed</i>

05:35.200 --> 05:37.271
more than 20,000 additional
American troops to Iraq.

05:37.440 --> 05:40.751
The vast majority of them...
five brigades...

05:40.880 --> 05:43.190
will be deployed to Baghdad.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.953
If we increase our support

05:45.080 --> 05:47.197
at this crucial moment
and help the Iraqis

05:47.320 --> 05:50.518
break the current cycle
of violence...

05:50.640 --> 05:53.553
Mom, what's a prime number
again?

05:53.680 --> 05:55.160
Mom?

05:55.280 --> 05:59.035
Mm, numbers only divisible
by one and themselves.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.360
Hey, Mom, sorry, I'm back.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.936
Well, I know you're busy

06:16.960 --> 06:18.553
so I won't keep you, dear.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.275
But I'm telling you,
it's the reason he can't sleep.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.591
Your boy needs his mother.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.076
Ma, Ma.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.677
I, um...

06:33.640 --> 06:35.871
I'm getting deployed to Iraq.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.480
<i>I just came from seeing</i>

06:40.600 --> 06:41.600
<i>Colonel Smith, sir.</i>

06:41.720 --> 06:43.598
I'm on the list.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.074
I know.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.032
The timing is not ideal, son.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.160
You just finished basic.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.158
I'd like for you to have

06:50.280 --> 06:52.431
more non-combat experience
first, but, uh,

06:52.560 --> 06:56.236
a military-wide shortage
of chaplains says otherwise.

06:56.360 --> 06:57.760
Infantry battalion, he said.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.200
Surge unit.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.549
They're the tip of the spear.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.514
Moving headlong every day
into trip wire, snipers,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.791
driving roads laced with IEDs.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.675
Well, I signed up to be
where the need is, sir.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.871
12 months will go by fast.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.720
A bit faster than 15,
for sure.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.559
15, Chaplain.

07:16.680 --> 07:18.160
Fifteen.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.195
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay,
time-out.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.471
Ah, time-out, time-out.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.000
- Gotcha.
- You missed!

07:27.120 --> 07:28.936
- You missed.
- What do you mean I missed? - ELIE: Daddy.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.920
I just hit you.
I totally hit you... miss?

07:30.960 --> 07:32.314
- Daddy. Daddy.
- What's up?

07:32.440 --> 07:33.669
Sweetie?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.320
- To cheer...
- Elie.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.431
...us up.
- Honey. Honey. Where's your inhaler?

07:37.600 --> 07:39.216
- Sweetie, sweetie, sweetie.
- Where's your inhaler?

07:39.240 --> 07:41.176
Where is it?
You don't have it? Okay.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.839
Um, I'm gonna go get
the spare...

07:42.960 --> 07:44.136
I'm gonna go get the spare.
Hang on a second.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.616
Hey, whoa, whoa, here it is.
I got it. I got it.

07:45.640 --> 07:46.856
- You got it?
- I got it. I got it.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.856
Come on, bug, up, up, up, up.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.314
You ready? One. Ready?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.990
- Huh? You okay?
- Ready, one more?

07:54.160 --> 07:56.231
Just breathe.

07:56.360 --> 07:57.635
- Good. Okay.
- Okay?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.256
- All right, come here.
- Okay, sweetheart.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.416
- Let's lie down, honey.
- You're okay.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.512
All right, we are good.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.960
- We are good.
- Good, good, good.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.117
- You okay?
- We're good.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.640
You good? Yeah.

08:15.720 --> 08:17.313
Ah. Yeah. Y-Y-Y-Yeah.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.238
Okay, go. Go.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.396
Hey.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.835
Thanks for coming, guys.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.440
- Heather, look who it is.
- Yeah.

08:25.560 --> 08:26.755
Oh.

08:26.880 --> 08:27.950
Oh. Hi.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.309
Darren Turner.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.640
Uh, Chaplain Turner, actually.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.720
It's nice to meet you.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.558
Major Michael Lewis.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.193
Oh.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.958
Uh, Tonya. Nice to meet you.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.157
- You, too.
- Properly, this time.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.953
I'm Heather.
It's so nice to meet you.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.120
You, too.

08:42.159 --> 08:43.309
Do you want to get a drink?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.954
- Uh, yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Yeah.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.754
Got a cold one?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.111
Yeah, man, I've been
icing them since dawn.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.154
There you go.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.115
Chaplain, huh?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.510
So I guess you really enjoyed
the show the other day.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.994
Oh, look, man, all I know is

09:06.120 --> 09:07.680
we all got lives going on
in our houses,

09:07.800 --> 09:10.872
and family or not,
life's just plain hard.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.310
The family I got in Iraq
is a crazy bunch,

09:13.440 --> 09:15.216
but they're easier
to deal with than this one.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.472
Well, it's

12:55.960 --> 12:58.839
Welcome to Baghdad, people,

12:58.960 --> 13:00.599
within 30 miles of which

13:00.720 --> 13:04.077
80% of all of Iraq's
sectarian violence takes place.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.795
Now, here at Forward
Operating Base Falcon,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.037
we are 8.1 miles south
of the Green Zone,

13:09.160 --> 13:10.674
but a nine iron away
from a freeway

13:10.800 --> 13:12.000
we are not allowed to control,

13:12.040 --> 13:13.918
and neighborhoods
full of people

13:14.040 --> 13:15.269
we're both here to protect

13:15.440 --> 13:17.511
and those who will try
and kill us.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.518
It's your job to know
the difference.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.518
Head on a swivel.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.359
Watch your six.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.997
At ease.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.119
Major North,
Chaplain Darren Turner.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.197
Good to meet you, Chaplain.
Welcome to camp.

13:36.320 --> 13:37.560
Nice to meet you, too,
Chaplain.

13:37.640 --> 13:39.438
Sit, sit.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.038
Master of Divinity, huh?

13:43.160 --> 13:45.391
How's that working out
with your kids?

13:46.480 --> 13:47.516
Sir?

13:47.680 --> 13:49.478
Your kids, Chaplain.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.616
'Cause North here, he's
got grand accreditation, too,

13:51.640 --> 13:53.916
but he'll be the first
to tell you that, uh,

13:54.040 --> 13:55.872
in the real world,
much less this one,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.136
theory and master's
dissertation

13:57.160 --> 13:58.674
just goes right out the window,

13:58.800 --> 14:00.837
kind of like at home
with three kids.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.953
Well... they're ten months
to eight years,

14:04.080 --> 14:06.231
so... so far they're on board.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.635
Well, it's
always a bonus having

14:07.760 --> 14:10.150
a chaplain who's a family man.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.075
Divorces filed
in the last three months.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.999
And, hey, mine didn't last
either, so I'm not judging.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.600
But I do know that soldiers

14:22.720 --> 14:25.280
losing families and having
nothing to go home to

14:25.400 --> 14:27.995
is not the stabilizing force
we need around here.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.998
Which goes
for you and yours, too.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.589
Oh, uh, understood, sir,

14:32.720 --> 14:35.076
but... Heather and I
are called to this.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.556
I mean, she even volunteered
for the family support team.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.637
It's what it's about for us.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.672
Well, all right, then.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.596
- Welcome to Falcon, Chaplain.
- Thank you, sir.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.360
<i>So...
the Casualty Response Team</i>

14:48.480 --> 14:51.791
is a part
of Family Readiness Group,

14:51.920 --> 14:53.752
and, um...

14:56.040 --> 14:58.350
I... I'm...

14:58.480 --> 15:00.597
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.599
I'm listening to myself, and...

15:03.720 --> 15:05.712
they can call it
the Family Readiness Group,

15:05.880 --> 15:08.395
but... this is
our third time out,

15:08.520 --> 15:12.673
and nobody's ever really ready
for this job.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.231
I imagine it's a hard job,

15:16.360 --> 15:19.159
but I really do feel
called to it.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.000
Um...

15:25.240 --> 15:27.630
Maybe I shouldn't
ask you this, but...

15:29.560 --> 15:32.155
Every time
Michael comes home...

15:32.280 --> 15:35.432
he's more... angry.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.119
Distant.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.234
Do you think you can ask Darren
to look out for Michael?

15:41.360 --> 15:44.353
I don't know,
maybe talk to him?

15:44.480 --> 15:47.837
- Of course.
<i>- Gun range</i>

15:47.960 --> 15:49.314
is down that road.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.000
Hospital's on the right.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.077
Chow's on the left,

15:54.200 --> 15:58.114
and the chaplain's tent's
right down there.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.032
- Can I speak with you, Chaplain?
- Certainly.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.072
Darren, why don't you go
to the range

16:07.200 --> 16:09.157
and meet your assistant,
Sergeant Peterson?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.118
I'll take your gear for you.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.320
Cease fire!

16:21.440 --> 16:23.750
- Excuse me, Captain.
- Huh?

16:23.920 --> 16:26.674
Know where I can find
a Sergeant Peterson up here?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.439
You found her, sir.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.918
No offense taken,

16:33.040 --> 16:34.536
but if there's a guy here
who can keep you alive

16:34.560 --> 16:36.836
and run your office like I can,

16:36.960 --> 16:38.360
I'll eat my helmet.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.073
Ready!

16:41.360 --> 16:42.680
Aim!

16:42.800 --> 16:43.950
Fire!

16:49.320 --> 16:50.936
If you get any better,
you're gonna embarrass

16:50.960 --> 16:53.794
the snipers around here,
Sergeant.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.158
Six years Atlanta PD.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.192
Here by way of National Guard.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.596
Here by the way of Fort Stewart

17:01.720 --> 17:03.598
and six years
of college campus ministry...

17:03.720 --> 17:05.551
so it was pretty much
the same thing.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.630
<i>Don't forget, Daddy, send us</i>

17:49.760 --> 17:52.275
- goofy-face photos, okay?
- Aye, aye, Cap.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.960
- Mommy wants her turn now.
- Thank you. - Phone hog!

17:55.080 --> 17:56.639
I only got to talk

17:56.800 --> 17:59.315
for one minute!
- Oh, they were so excited to talk to you.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.830
- It is so great to hear your voice.
- You, too.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.795
Man, two weeks feels like one
and a hundred at the same time.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.434
A hundred?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.995
Wow. How you holding up?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.589
Well, I am enjoying sleeping
on your side of the bed.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.598
- Is that bad?
- Hardly.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.473
I have a one-man cot
all to myself...

18:16.600 --> 18:18.717
you should live it up, too.

18:18.840 --> 18:22.470
But I really think
I can make a difference here.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.353
Yeah, of course you can.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.870
Oh, hey, okay,
so the website is up,

18:27.040 --> 18:29.680
and our plan is just
to post pictures every day

18:29.800 --> 18:31.439
so you don't miss a thing.

18:32.960 --> 18:35.236
Oh, um,
I'm out of time already.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.760
What?

18:36.880 --> 18:38.997
Okay, next time
the kids'll have to wait.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.033
I love you so much.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.511
I love you, too.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.230
Oh. Hey...

19:18.360 --> 19:19.714
Shonda.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.116
Sergeant. Just... come in.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.277
Jacobsen moved up
the meet and greet,

19:24.400 --> 19:27.552
but deliveries
from the family come first.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.635
Official
army business there, Chaplain?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.877
Uh, keep a family together,
keep a soldier together.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.834
- Darn right.
<i>- So, today,</i>

19:44.960 --> 19:45.976
third and fourth platoons
are gonna sweep

19:46.000 --> 19:46.877
our next-door neighbors again,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.480
see if we can slow down

19:48.600 --> 19:51.274
the welcome gifts
coming over the wall.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.198
- Hooah?
- Hooah!

19:53.320 --> 19:55.676
Chaplain Turner,
mind sending them out?

19:59.880 --> 20:03.396
It's been an honor meeting
such amazing men and women,

20:03.520 --> 20:04.920
committed to our country

20:05.040 --> 20:07.236
and defending the defenseless
here in Iraq.

20:07.360 --> 20:11.320
I hope it goes without saying
that my tent is open 24/7.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.119
I'd like to meet you all.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.996
Lord...

20:18.120 --> 20:20.715
be with these men and women
as they go out today.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.593
Please protect them.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.754
<i>So...</i>

20:25.880 --> 20:28.270
did I sound okay
out there today?

20:28.400 --> 20:31.234
Sorry, I used to be on staff
at a church, and...

20:31.360 --> 20:34.159
now that I'm here I don't want
to sound like I'm at a pulpit.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.990
Otherwise, you know,
nobody'll come by.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.874
Just leave that box of snacks
on your desk.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.595
Word'll travel.
They'll come.

20:44.920 --> 20:47.515
Oh, I saw a glimpse
of your delivery today.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.357
Ma told me to bring it.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.520
Apparently went through
my nightstand to make sure.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.155
Ah, one of those moms
that loves their daughters...

20:57.280 --> 20:59.556
- I hate those.
- Ah, more like one

20:59.680 --> 21:02.798
that thinks getting me back
on track is her job, not mine.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.150
You on that, Gonzalez?

21:09.680 --> 21:11.353
Take that as a yes.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.517
I have a son.

21:21.640 --> 21:24.394
Wow, look at that handsome guy.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.160
You, uh, talk to him yet,
since...?

21:27.280 --> 21:30.034
He's three,
so not much of a talker.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.197
So, does he take after you
or his father?

21:32.320 --> 21:34.915
Huh! You mean the guy
that saw the double lines

21:35.040 --> 21:37.316
on the pregnancy test,
left and never looked back?

21:37.480 --> 21:38.800
That guy?

21:38.920 --> 21:41.230
No, he does not get that title.

21:41.400 --> 21:45.076
And no, he wasn't my husband,
so save the lecture.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.278
My mama got that covered.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.517
Well, he's a gift from God.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.836
That's all that matters now.

21:56.480 --> 21:59.712
It was long but fine.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.599
I mean, long.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.473
Your prayer.

22:03.600 --> 22:06.559
Sounded like you cared.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.919
Hey, Chaplain,
you almost finished?

22:33.440 --> 22:36.194
So, talked to my family
the other day.

22:36.320 --> 22:38.471
Yeah?

22:38.600 --> 22:41.320
Sounds like yours and mine
have been hanging out.

22:41.440 --> 22:43.671
Great.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.036
Well, it sounds like Tonya
would love to hear from you.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.231
What's your deal, man?

22:48.360 --> 22:49.555
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

22:49.720 --> 22:51.336
messing with other people's
lives just part

22:51.360 --> 22:52.800
of your job description
or something?

22:52.880 --> 22:55.679
I mean, kind of.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.712
Okay, well, my marriage...

22:57.840 --> 22:59.513
is none of your business.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.552
You don't know anything
about me

23:01.680 --> 23:04.354
or my family.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.915
I know your family loves you.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.078
And I know they'd love
to hear it back.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.550
You know what? I'm-I'm-I'm
gonna tell you how it works.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.160
'Cause you never been
to Iraq before,

23:15.280 --> 23:17.431
so you don't know
what it's like to come home.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.315
You... ain't never
gonna be the same.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.636
And neither is your little
picture-perfect marriage

23:23.760 --> 23:26.070
that you probably think
you have.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.669
Stay out of my business.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.240
Tell you what.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.120
You call, they hang up...

23:39.240 --> 23:41.197
I'll never bother you again.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.637
That a promise?

23:44.760 --> 23:47.116
Yeah, that's a promise.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.238
Hello.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.956
Hey. Hey, it's, uh...

24:09.080 --> 24:10.673
It's me.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.797
- Michael?
- Yeah. No, it was...

24:12.920 --> 24:15.389
It was a different number.
It's a...

24:15.520 --> 24:17.398
I'm on the chaplain's phone,
but...

24:17.560 --> 24:20.359
- Our neighbor.
- Yeah, the neighbor.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.354
One... more.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.591
And... I think I got it.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.677
Looks great, guys.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.040
I will get those proofs to you next week, and...
- Okay.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.056
- Yeah, they look great, everything.
- Thank you.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.192
Excuse me.

24:36.320 --> 24:39.199
I think I saw you at the base
when our husbands deployed.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.277
- Oh.
- I'm Heather Turner.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.551
- Hi. I'm Amanda.
- Hi. Who is this?

24:43.680 --> 24:46.320
This is Alexis.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.954
She's so sweet.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.595
Most of the time...
she won't stop crying.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.234
She knows her daddy's gone.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.273
She was up all night,
so I was up all night.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.120
I had to take work off today,
which I can't afford.

24:58.240 --> 25:01.631
Amanda, I don't know about you,
but this is by far

25:01.760 --> 25:03.479
the hardest thing
I've ever done.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.991
It is okay to feel overwhelmed.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.840
You're not the only one
who feels this way, I promise.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.917
You-you know, um,

25:12.040 --> 25:14.555
my number is on the Readiness
Group contact sheet

25:14.680 --> 25:19.391
if you ever want to talk
or hang or, you know, whatever.

25:22.680 --> 25:25.639
I'm pregnant.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.992
I don't know
how I'm supposed to tell him.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.235
Oh.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.237
Med Unit
Bravo, I need all medics.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.714
I've got four wounded inbound.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.416
- Two green critical...
- Hey, let's get

25:46.440 --> 25:49.478
another stretcher over here.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.910
All medics to the hospital.
Severe chest injury.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.952
That your blood, Corporal?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.434
They hit us with two RPGs, sir.

25:55.560 --> 25:57.336
- Let's go! Let's go!
- First grenade missed,

25:57.360 --> 25:59.400
but second one hit Cosgrove's
vehicle, and we, uh...

25:59.480 --> 26:01.233
Who exactly is injured,
Corporal?

26:01.360 --> 26:03.376
- Cosgrove, Mitchell, and...
- Abdomen wound.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.119
Get her down!

26:05.240 --> 26:07.118
Hurry up, please, hurry up!

26:07.240 --> 26:09.357
His two daughters, sir.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.274
Hey, who's gonna take this one?

26:25.560 --> 26:28.758
We couldn't save her, Chaplain.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.999
So I guess, you know...

26:33.120 --> 26:36.318
you do whatever it is you do.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.557
Specialist?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.400
Yeah.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.716
What's your name?

26:45.840 --> 26:49.311
It's Bradley.
Lance Bradley.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.716
I'm sure you did
everything you could.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.000
Get me a gurney out here now!

27:24.120 --> 27:25.496
I got to get ahold of my wife.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.936
- No, you need, you need to lay down, sir.
- My wife.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.360
Lay down, sir.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.517
Three more. Call the coroner.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.597
Got it.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.896
Tragically, officials confirm

27:45.920 --> 27:49.596
two soldiers from Fort Stewart
were killed by Iraqi insurgents

27:49.720 --> 27:51.439
today while conducting a patrol

27:51.560 --> 27:53.472
during combat operations
in Baghdad.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.990
The troops were part
of the deployment that left

27:56.120 --> 27:58.635
Fort Stewart in April
as part of the troop surge.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.352
- I am... so sorry.
- Oh, God. It's okay.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.040
I wasn't thinking.
I should have called.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.112
No, it's okay. It's okay.
I'm just so relieved

28:13.240 --> 28:15.436
that you are not a chaplain
in uniform right now.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.031
Oh. Okay. So we're up?

28:19.160 --> 28:22.198
The notifying chaplain
and casualty officer are

28:22.320 --> 28:24.471
at the house now,
and we're next

28:24.640 --> 28:26.677
till family arrives.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.192
Hello. Tanner residence.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.960
- Hey, bug.
- Daddy!

29:04.080 --> 29:07.437
It's so good
to hear your voice.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.677
I miss you so much.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.190
I miss you, too.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.960
Is everything okay?

29:15.080 --> 29:17.879
Mommy looked worried when she
left with Miss Tonya, and...

29:18.000 --> 29:20.720
I'm okay... I promise.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.071
Are you wearing
your special armor?

29:26.880 --> 29:29.839
I sure am, bug.
Are you?

29:29.960 --> 29:31.519
Every day.

29:31.640 --> 29:33.313
When I remember.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.914
Give everyone a great big hug
for me, okay?

29:41.040 --> 29:42.679
Bye, baby.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.991
Bye, Daddy.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.111
Okay. Here goes.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.440
You ready to do this?

30:08.240 --> 30:10.596
Oh, Lord,
we have to do this well.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.597
We've got this.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.836
You okay, Chaplain?

30:17.000 --> 30:18.639
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.216
'Cause there are some folks
around here

30:20.240 --> 30:22.675
that could probably use
a visit right about now.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.677
Turner?

30:50.440 --> 30:52.750
Sorry, sir.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.630
Standing here now, I'm...

30:56.760 --> 30:59.320
not quite sure
what I should say.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.237
Well,

31:04.360 --> 31:08.559
I'm-I'm no expert
in your line of work, but...

31:08.720 --> 31:10.680
how about you just leave
that Master's of Divinity

31:10.800 --> 31:12.837
back in your tent, and...

31:12.960 --> 31:14.917
just go give a few boys
your heart?

31:16.520 --> 31:21.072
As it stands now,
it'd probably go a long way.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.156
Third platoon, Alpha?

31:45.280 --> 31:47.237
You found it, Chaplain.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.034
Come on in.

31:50.160 --> 31:53.471
Well, I'm sorry
to interrupt you guys.

31:53.640 --> 31:55.518
This is my first memorial here,

31:55.680 --> 31:59.435
so I could use your help

31:59.600 --> 32:02.752
if you don't mind telling me
about your friends.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.630
Civvies were all around us
as we came off the last bridge.

32:09.760 --> 32:14.039
Two blasts, one right after
another behind us,

32:14.200 --> 32:16.556
and we ran back, you know,

32:16.680 --> 32:18.512
pulled, pulled Mitchell
out of the fire, but

32:18.640 --> 32:21.474
he was already gone.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.034
And Cosgrove
was already inside,

32:23.160 --> 32:25.311
getting the two girls out.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.636
The flames just took him.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.398
Mitchell was engaged.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.876
Cosgrove's wife is pregnant.

32:36.040 --> 32:38.475
I've been with them both
since basic.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.599
And when my fiancée
decided that

32:41.720 --> 32:45.600
military life wasn't for her,
those two guys

32:45.720 --> 32:47.712
didn't leave my side
till we shipped out.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.275
Probably kept me
from losing it.

32:50.400 --> 32:54.394
What'd you do
with the girl, Chaplain?

32:58.600 --> 33:00.478
Medics finally took her.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.910
So, uh...

33:05.320 --> 33:07.391
What, do you have
a Bible verse to explain

33:07.520 --> 33:10.558
why a girl's life was taken
before it even began?

33:12.360 --> 33:14.272
No.

33:14.400 --> 33:15.993
No, I do not.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.998
Okay.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.476
But I have daughters, too.

33:20.640 --> 33:25.351
And the thought of losing them
is beyond what I can imagine.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.638
Yeah, I have a daughter, too.
So what?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.956
You're peddling a God
that'll take mine tomorrow,

33:31.080 --> 33:32.560
maybe yours the next day.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.957
Look, you're angry.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.914
I get it. I mean,
we all rage at death, right?

33:40.360 --> 33:42.272
I think
there's a reason for that.

33:42.400 --> 33:46.110
I think... it's because
we were made for life.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.437
And I believe in a God who came

33:49.560 --> 33:52.359
to rescue us from death
and bring us into life.

33:54.560 --> 33:58.793
Who gave us all life
to begin with.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.470
For a specific time
and a specific purpose.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.872
Until He chooses
to bring us home with Him.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.896
You want to know
what that little girl said

34:10.920 --> 34:12.320
when we first picked her up?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.909
She told me
through the translator.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.192
She just wanted to live
to do two things...

34:18.320 --> 34:20.676
fly in an airplane
and climb a mountain...

34:23.360 --> 34:24.793
...to be closer to God.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.536
Little innocent girl didn't do
anything to deserve to die.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.279
She wanted
to be closer to God.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.800
And she believed in a God

34:33.920 --> 34:36.230
that didn't do anything
to save her life.

34:37.840 --> 34:39.877
You got a Bible verse for that?

34:43.719 --> 34:45.916
I wish I did.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.672
Yeah.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.074
I hear you.

34:54.199 --> 34:56.317
I do.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.478
Sorry about your friends.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.037
And I'm sorry
about your fiancée.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.879
Thanks, Chap.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.670
Okay.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.078
Uh... hi, babe.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.833
Man, I hope
there's never a reason

35:33.960 --> 35:35.792
for you to watch this video.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.155
But if you are,

35:48.280 --> 35:50.715
I suppose there's no use
in covering that up.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.990
I mean, I feel so wrong
not sharing everything

35:55.120 --> 35:57.715
that's going on over here,

35:57.880 --> 35:59.917
like we do at home.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.837
Sir.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.997
At ease.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.476
So, how much for the jerky?

36:30.600 --> 36:33.274
- 20 bucks a pop.
- Ooh!

36:33.400 --> 36:36.359
Smart man.
I'd clean you out.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.474
Unless you do that.

36:44.600 --> 36:45.750
Then they're free.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.640
Um, you know, I was a bit rough
on you last night.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.989
Sorry about that.

36:52.120 --> 36:53.440
No, it's fine.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.677
Kind of comes
with the territory.

36:55.800 --> 36:59.077
Oh, that's, uh, Sam, six,
Elie, eight,

36:59.200 --> 37:00.873
and-and Heather
holding Meribeth,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.834
- who is all of... ten months.
- Yeah.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.599
Daughter Alexis, wife Amanda.

37:10.720 --> 37:13.076
- She's cute.
- Who just told me

37:13.200 --> 37:16.989
five minutes ago we got
to come up with another name.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.157
Man, that's great.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.351
Congratulations.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.519
Is there something
on your mind, Bradley?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.957
You said something
the other day.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.878
You said, uh, God gives us life

37:33.000 --> 37:35.310
for a specific time
and purpose,

37:35.480 --> 37:39.190
and then takes us home safely.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.955
Yeah.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.037
Home safe in heaven.

37:44.160 --> 37:46.595
All right, see,
that's the part that got me.

37:46.720 --> 37:47.949
All right, so let's say

37:48.080 --> 37:50.072
I buy in
and something happens to me,

37:50.200 --> 37:51.839
and I'm safe in heaven.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.555
Where does that leave
my wife and kids?

37:54.680 --> 37:58.230
I mean, if there's no guarantee
of safety here,

37:58.360 --> 38:00.317
what happens to them?

38:00.440 --> 38:03.080
Do my kids go off the rails
without a father?

38:03.200 --> 38:05.351
Does Amanda lose it,
let some drunk loser

38:05.480 --> 38:07.073
move in, start hurting them,

38:07.200 --> 38:08.873
making their lives
a living hell

38:09.000 --> 38:11.993
while I'm all cozy
and warm in heaven?

38:12.120 --> 38:15.079
Tell me my kids won't ever
go through what I did.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.113
When my dad left,

38:20.240 --> 38:22.197
I knew he wasn't coming back.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.192
I mean, he said
he stopped loving my mom,

38:24.360 --> 38:29.037
but it felt clear as day
that he stopped loving me, too.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.874
Okay, is that it?
That's not helping.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.435
I didn't have a dad...

38:34.560 --> 38:38.031
but I had... I still have

38:38.160 --> 38:40.038
another Father.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.879
One who has never left me.

38:42.000 --> 38:45.072
One who has
never abandoned me.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.034
One who won't abandon you
orAmanda orAlexis

38:48.160 --> 38:50.152
or that new little one
you got coming.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.280
No matter what comes next.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.836
All right.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.400
Don't get any ideas.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.477
I just like free stuff.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.317
<i>Mm, the kids made me</i>

39:20.440 --> 39:22.875
a cake for our anniversary,
at least, so that was nice.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.196
Kids remembered, and I didn't.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.834
Don't worry, I saved a piece

39:26.960 --> 39:28.792
to put in
your next care package.

39:28.920 --> 39:32.072
Um, this is a wild idea, but

39:32.200 --> 39:34.874
would you be up to coordinating
some Christmas stockings

39:35.000 --> 39:36.593
for the soldiers?

39:36.720 --> 39:38.552
You could fill them
with gifts and snacks

39:38.680 --> 39:40.034
like you've been sending me.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.631
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
How-how many do you need?

39:43.760 --> 39:46.832
Uh, give or take, a thousand.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.077
O-kay.
So, reinforcements then?

39:49.240 --> 39:50.959
Yeah.

39:51.080 --> 39:56.439
Um... I guess I could get
some other wives involved.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.076
I could actually, like,
turn it into a community thing.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.760
Get some churches
and schools in on it.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.912
That's a great idea.

40:05.040 --> 40:07.600
Man, can you believe
school starts in a week?

40:07.720 --> 40:10.440
No, I can't.
How are they?

40:10.560 --> 40:12.313
They're good.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.760
Sam was so excited

40:13.880 --> 40:15.519
about getting
the green belt in karate.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.399
Wait. Already?

40:17.560 --> 40:21.031
Uh, yeah. I posted those pics,
like, two weeks ago.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.794
Right. Shoot, I... I got to

40:25.920 --> 40:28.230
look at that thing more.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.313
Babe... is everything okay?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.791
You just...
you sound different.

40:36.920 --> 40:39.037
Uh, no, no, I'm fine.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.551
Sorry. Uh, really,
it's just...

40:44.440 --> 40:47.831
...maybe a little harder
than I expected here.

40:47.960 --> 40:50.031
♪ Yeah ♪

40:50.160 --> 40:51.640
♪ What's the plan,
what's the plan? ♪

41:03.280 --> 41:05.749
All right,
gentlemen, that's game.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.473
Shower up...
we're moving out in 30.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.016
Next time,
next time I got Chappy.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.440
All right.

41:11.560 --> 41:12.835
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.758
I told you I was open, man.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.440
Yeah, but we didn't need two,
boss, we needed three for 21.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.416
Oh, come on, that was
a lucky shot and you know it...

41:19.440 --> 41:21.875
- unless you had a little bit of help.
- Mm, maybe.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.110
Yeah. Come on.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.038
Hey, before you head out, uh,

41:25.160 --> 41:26.719
I've been meaning
to give you this.

41:26.880 --> 41:30.317
Yeah, dude, I-I-I'm good.
I don't do lucky charms.

41:30.440 --> 41:32.600
It's not about luck.
- Look, if it don't stop a bullet

41:32.760 --> 41:34.513
or diffuse a bomb,
I don't need it, okay?

41:34.640 --> 41:36.552
But, look, if it makes you
feel any better,

41:36.720 --> 41:38.598
I... I've been talking
to Tonya a lot more.

41:38.720 --> 41:39.995
Yeah, yeah, don't get excited,

41:40.120 --> 41:42.112
all right?
It's not that deep and stuff.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.993
Look, I don't know
what that wife of yours

41:44.120 --> 41:46.237
has got her thinking
you're gonna do for me, but...

41:46.360 --> 41:47.999
she keeps telling me
to talk to you.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.554
So, uh...

41:49.680 --> 41:51.399
mm, good talk.

41:51.520 --> 41:52.397
Oh!

41:52.520 --> 41:53.556
Thank you.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.831
- Was a lucky shot.
- That's great.

41:55.960 --> 41:58.839
Out here,
you put your lives on the line

41:58.960 --> 42:01.600
every second of every day.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.598
You risk everything

42:03.720 --> 42:05.951
to make this world on Earth
a better place.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.514
And let me tell you something,

42:07.640 --> 42:10.599
God is no stranger
to the battlefield.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.633
And that's why I'm here today.

42:18.320 --> 42:20.960
The body of our Lord
broken for you.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.549
The blood of our Lord
shed for you.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.599
Long day, huh?

42:40.720 --> 42:43.110
Yeah.

42:47.240 --> 42:50.199
You're doing a great job,
Shonda.

42:50.320 --> 42:52.630
You know that, right?

42:52.760 --> 42:55.320
Does it matter?

42:55.440 --> 42:58.831
If I'm a failure as a mom?

43:00.360 --> 43:02.352
It's true.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.278
A few months
after Colby was born,

43:05.400 --> 43:10.600
I started finding any excuse
not to go home.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.071
Acting like it was
to provide for him,

43:14.200 --> 43:16.431
but...

43:20.520 --> 43:22.796
I got so used to it

43:22.920 --> 43:26.994
that I realize now that I don't
even know where to start

43:27.120 --> 43:29.954
to show up for that boy.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.436
And I want to, and...

43:38.000 --> 43:39.878
Well...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.276
I got news for you.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.234
We can work on that.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.039
Sam, hurry.

43:54.800 --> 43:56.120
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Hurry.

43:56.240 --> 43:58.596
Hurry. We need
to pray for Daddy.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.440
Dear God,

44:01.560 --> 44:04.792
please protect Daddy,
wherever he is right now.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.832
- Please?
<i>- All right, guys,</i>

44:06.960 --> 44:08.030
let's go.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.830
Let's go! Now.

44:30.960 --> 44:31.996
This is Oscar 2!

44:32.120 --> 44:34.760
We are pinned down
on the northeast corner!

44:34.880 --> 44:36.633
Head for the bunker!

44:36.760 --> 44:37.760
Where?!

44:37.840 --> 44:39.399
I don't see a bunker! Over!

44:39.520 --> 44:41.796
- I'm coming to you!
- Chaplain, when I move,

44:41.920 --> 44:42.797
you move!

44:45.240 --> 44:47.835
Right now, God, watch over him.

44:47.960 --> 44:51.715
Keep Daddy safe
from the enemy now.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.069
- Guys?
- Mommy,

44:53.200 --> 44:56.113
- hurry!
- Okay, okay.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.436
All right,
we got to move! We got to move.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.677
Get up! Get up!

45:00.840 --> 45:02.354
Go, go! Come on!

45:03.440 --> 45:04.999
Come on. Get up!

45:05.120 --> 45:07.760
Get up! We've got to move!

45:18.040 --> 45:19.918
Hey, hey, hey,

45:20.040 --> 45:21.918
hey, hey, you're gonna be okay.

45:22.040 --> 45:23.952
Neighbor, neighbor.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.470
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

45:26.600 --> 45:28.000
All right.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.992
Props for the help, Major.

45:42.760 --> 45:44.353
<i>And bring Daddy home safe,</i>

45:44.480 --> 45:45.709
Jesus.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.435
And Mia and Nia's daddy, too.

45:48.560 --> 45:51.155
In Jesus' name, amen.

45:58.080 --> 46:00.390
I have never seen
Elie pray like that.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.636
It was intense,

46:01.760 --> 46:04.559
like she sensed
something specific.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.720
What? What is it?

46:07.840 --> 46:09.896
I'm gonna give that girl
a list of things to pray for...

46:09.920 --> 46:11.274
that's what.

46:11.400 --> 46:13.119
Why?

46:13.240 --> 46:15.118
There was a mortar attack.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.675
- What? Wait, when? I...
- Yeah.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.560
- Are they okay?
- W-Well, they were visiting

46:19.600 --> 46:20.716
other bases for officer...

46:20.880 --> 46:22.280
- Tonya, are they okay?
- Yes.

46:22.400 --> 46:25.074
Yes. They are okay.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.276
Why didn't he tell me?

46:29.400 --> 46:31.517
Oh, girl,
something like that happens,

46:31.680 --> 46:33.433
- your man is busy.
- No,

46:33.600 --> 46:35.956
I know, but he...

46:36.080 --> 46:37.799
I know.

46:41.080 --> 46:42.958
I just feel
like there's something more

46:43.080 --> 46:44.958
that's happening between us.

46:45.080 --> 46:47.197
Between you two?

46:47.320 --> 46:48.515
Honey, trust me.

46:48.640 --> 46:51.030
It's not between you two.

46:51.200 --> 46:55.160
It's between you two
and that war.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.755
Thanks, I think.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.435
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.438
Amanda!

47:03.560 --> 47:06.120
- Hi. I thought you would be here.
- Hey.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.357
I heard you guys needed help
with the stockings

47:08.480 --> 47:10.358
- for the soldiers.
- Well, yeah, but, come on,

47:10.480 --> 47:12.790
- you got your plate full.
- I know.

47:12.920 --> 47:15.040
Honestly, I just kind of wanted
to have a conversation

47:15.160 --> 47:16.879
about something
other than Elmo.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.878
I totally hear you.
Hey, come with me.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.056
I want to introduce you to somebody, okay?
- All right.

47:36.320 --> 47:37.754
Take this one!

47:37.880 --> 47:39.951
Don't leave me!

47:46.320 --> 47:48.960
Starting to see
a pattern here, sir.

47:49.080 --> 47:51.754
I leave, you taking

47:51.880 --> 47:55.271
silly photos or looking at 'em,
and on and on it goes.

47:55.400 --> 47:57.551
Yeah.

47:57.680 --> 48:00.593
How much
can you miss somebody, huh?

48:00.720 --> 48:02.996
Oh, don't look now,
but I think the chaplain

48:03.120 --> 48:05.589
might need a pep talk
of his own.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.996
Maybe later. Right now
the chair is all yours.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.873
What do you mean?

48:10.000 --> 48:11.719
Special assignment.

48:14.640 --> 48:16.393
You said it was
Colby's favorite, right?

48:18.120 --> 48:19.856
Hit record on the remote
whenever you're ready and...

48:19.880 --> 48:22.679
read to your boy.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.679
I don't know what to say.

48:27.520 --> 48:29.000
Don't just read.

48:29.120 --> 48:31.271
Pretend he's sitting
right there in your lap.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.119
'Cause when your mom plays it
for him,

48:33.240 --> 48:34.879
he'll feel like he is.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.040
Hi, Colby!

49:09.160 --> 49:13.518
Mama misses you so much,
my boy.

49:13.640 --> 49:17.156
And I miss you
more than anything

49:17.280 --> 49:20.398
in the whole wide world.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.836
So...

49:22.960 --> 49:25.680
I wanted to read you a story,

49:25.800 --> 49:28.395
one we both love.

49:34.440 --> 49:37.319
"When you arise

49:37.440 --> 49:40.638
"with sleepy eyes,

49:40.760 --> 49:45.198
"my smiling face you see.

49:45.320 --> 49:46.436
"I love you high.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.677
"I love you low.

49:48.800 --> 49:50.917
"I love you deep.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.271
"I love you wide.

49:53.400 --> 49:57.519
I love you this much."

50:15.000 --> 50:16.514
<i>I noticed you haven't updated</i>

50:16.640 --> 50:18.950
the photos
on the website lately.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.096
Well, seemed like you weren't
really looking at the pictures,

50:21.120 --> 50:23.237
so...

50:23.360 --> 50:24.396
You there, babe?

50:24.520 --> 50:25.715
Uh, yeah.

50:25.840 --> 50:27.080
Just, you know, cooking dinner.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.157
And the kids are in a mood.

50:30.480 --> 50:32.517
We lost three more soldiers
today.

50:34.480 --> 50:37.359
Guess that means Tonya and I
have our work cut out for us.

50:37.480 --> 50:40.120
Mom, Sam's using your camera!

50:40.240 --> 50:42.277
Sam, put it down!

50:42.400 --> 50:44.631
I'm taking pictures for Daddy!

50:44.760 --> 50:47.275
Guys! I can't hear your dad!

50:47.440 --> 50:50.592
Oh, hey, um,
did the stockings arrive?

50:50.720 --> 50:53.679
Yeah.
They-They're amazing, babe.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.598
I can't wait for Christmas.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.189
My parents will be here.
Still can't believe you won't.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.120
Guys!

51:01.240 --> 51:02.594
You know what, honey, I can't...

51:02.720 --> 51:04.791
I got to...
I can't talk right now, okay?

51:04.920 --> 51:06.718
No, no, I get it.
I get it. It's okay.

51:06.840 --> 51:08.576
I get it. Totally fine...

51:08.600 --> 51:10.717
Um... Bye!

51:10.880 --> 51:13.714
Bye.

51:13.880 --> 51:16.395
<i>We're going to be transporting</i>

51:16.520 --> 51:17.776
former Sunni insurgents
fighting with us now

51:17.800 --> 51:19.678
against al-Qaeda.

51:19.800 --> 51:21.519
We are not the only ones
who know.

51:21.680 --> 51:24.673
So, from Al Sakhar province
here,

51:24.800 --> 51:26.757
Bravo will neutralize
opposition out front

51:26.880 --> 51:28.599
forAlpha running escort

51:28.720 --> 51:30.552
to get these civilian forces
in for training

51:30.680 --> 51:31.955
to Patrol Base Hawkes here.

51:32.080 --> 51:33.878
Any questions?

51:35.520 --> 51:36.920
Sir, before we head off,

51:37.040 --> 51:38.759
mind if I send us out?

51:38.880 --> 51:41.270
Knock it out of the park.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.114
Hey. Lance.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.879
Fuel for the road.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.640
Oh, what, you're not
gonna charge me this time?

51:55.800 --> 51:56.870
Thank you.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.071
- You're welcome.
- And, uh,

51:59.200 --> 52:01.317
you know, thanks for what
you're doing here, too.

52:01.440 --> 52:02.920
I think it's really helping.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.235
For me, at least.

52:04.360 --> 52:05.635
Yeah, man, of course.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.638
Oh, check it out... I, uh...

52:07.760 --> 52:11.276
I've been taking this with me
on all my trips out of Falcon.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.079
I must say,
for such a tiny little book,

52:13.200 --> 52:14.919
there sure is a lot to read.

52:16.480 --> 52:18.597
Dang, there's a lot
that I don't understand in it.

52:18.720 --> 52:20.996
- You know, I can help you with that.
- Yeah?

52:21.120 --> 52:23.157
Yeah.
- Bradley, one. Turner, two with me.

52:23.280 --> 52:26.079
All right, hey, we'll see you out there.
- Yeah.

52:26.200 --> 52:29.113
Hey, uh, why don't you
hold on to this?

52:29.240 --> 52:31.471
What the heck is that?

52:31.600 --> 52:33.080
Oh.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.317
Yeah, you're a closer, huh?

52:35.440 --> 52:37.875
It's just a reminder that
you don't have to be afraid.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.038
- God's got your back.
- All right, moving out!

52:47.240 --> 52:48.356
All right.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.517
I told you,
I just like free stuff.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.439
Bradley, let's go!

52:58.160 --> 53:00.038
We're about five klicks north

53:00.160 --> 53:01.753
of Al Sakhar. Over.

53:01.880 --> 53:02.880
Roger that, Alpha.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.440
Yeah.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.320
Stevie Wonder drives
better than you, Carter.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.556
Hey, Turner, doesn't the
Good Book say

53:12.680 --> 53:13.760
"Be kind to your neighbor"?

53:13.840 --> 53:15.433
- Uh-huh.
- Sitting next to you,

53:15.560 --> 53:17.677
Major, that makes me
your neighbor.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.832
No, no, no, no, no.

53:19.960 --> 53:21.838
Tell me I did not do it, I...

53:23.560 --> 53:25.517
Forgot my ChapStick!

53:26.840 --> 53:29.036
Gonna have to bum yours,
Stevie. Come on.

53:29.160 --> 53:33.313
- No. Nobody bums ChapStick.
- Come on, man, you were just

53:33.480 --> 53:34.936
talking about being kind
to your neighbor.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.031
Look, look, I'll pay you
for it, all right?

53:37.160 --> 53:38.640
Just, m-my lips
are cracked bad.

53:38.760 --> 53:39.989
Tell you what.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.510
We pass a Walmart,
I'll stop, okay?

53:42.640 --> 53:44.120
Ha!

53:58.400 --> 54:01.199
I've got three balls
for a dollar.

54:03.680 --> 54:06.036
Three balls for a dollar, and you can do it!
- Come on.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.160
You can do it!

54:16.840 --> 54:18.991
I won it! I won it!

54:19.120 --> 54:21.157
Hey, can we take Sam and Elie

54:21.320 --> 54:24.040
- to the maze, Mommy?
- Um... - Please...

54:24.160 --> 54:26.056
Yeah.
- Go ahead, sure, we'll wait at the front entrance,

54:26.080 --> 54:28.470
- where the funnel cake booth is.
- Oh, Lord help us.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.680
- Hey, guys, stay together, okay?
- Yeah, be careful.

54:30.720 --> 54:33.713
- Um, it's over here. Okay.
- Over here.

55:13.200 --> 55:16.159
Looks like our objective,
gents. Eleven o'clock.

55:16.280 --> 55:18.317
I got one male.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.750
One male.

55:20.920 --> 55:21.990
That's our escort.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.191
We're looking for a 12-pax bus.

55:24.320 --> 55:26.835
Bradley, what you see up top?

55:26.960 --> 55:28.314
Looking good.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.919
Rooftop's clear.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.550
Sam?

55:49.560 --> 55:50.914
Sam?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.430
Sam?

56:02.680 --> 56:04.160
Sam?

56:19.400 --> 56:21.551
Ho! We got two on a rooftop,
one o'clock.

56:23.400 --> 56:26.837
- One of 'em has a cell.
- One o'clock.

56:29.200 --> 56:31.920
Come on, faster! Let's go!

56:34.600 --> 56:36.876
No sign of a 12-pax, gentlemen.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.514
I think we got a problem.

56:38.640 --> 56:39.710
Stay alert.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.071
Bradley, give me an update.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.199
Yeah, bogeys are gone.

56:50.120 --> 56:53.716
Oh, hey, look,
there's our bus. Ha.

56:56.040 --> 56:57.760
Where'd our escort go?

56:59.120 --> 57:00.998
Dude...

57:01.120 --> 57:02.236
he's gone.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.434
Get down! Get down!

57:15.280 --> 57:18.193
Bradley! Take them out!

57:18.320 --> 57:20.039
My gun's jammed!

57:37.360 --> 57:38.635
Get out of here now!

57:42.720 --> 57:43.870
Mom! Come quick!

57:44.000 --> 57:46.151
It's Elie! She can't breathe!

57:46.280 --> 57:48.237
This way! This way!

57:48.400 --> 57:50.392
Call a medic now!

57:59.680 --> 58:00.909
We got multiple shooters!

58:02.800 --> 58:04.040
Lance, watch your head.

58:04.160 --> 58:06.356
Whit, get us out of here!

58:16.880 --> 58:17.996
Elie? Elie?

58:19.960 --> 58:21.679
Elie? Elie? Baby.

58:21.800 --> 58:23.837
Can you breathe?
Can you breathe?

58:23.960 --> 58:26.031
Where's your inhaler?
Where is it?

58:26.160 --> 58:28.755
Did you see an inhaler?
A little plastic thing?

58:28.880 --> 58:31.031
Did you see an inhaler?

58:31.160 --> 58:33.152
Where is it? Okay.
Okay, come on.

58:33.320 --> 58:35.391
Come on. Let's go.

58:38.200 --> 58:40.112
Okay. Sam, where's the exit?!

58:40.240 --> 58:41.560
Honey?

58:41.680 --> 58:43.239
Honey, wake up. Please.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.113
Honey, wake up.
Oh, God.

58:45.240 --> 58:46.833
Where's the exit?!

58:47.000 --> 58:49.720
Contact left! Engaging!

58:50.960 --> 58:51.996
Whit, punch it!

59:02.680 --> 59:03.680
I got you.

59:03.720 --> 59:04.720
Lord.

59:04.840 --> 59:05.840
Where is it?

59:05.920 --> 59:07.240
Can someone get me...

59:07.360 --> 59:09.352
Do you know where the exit is?

59:09.520 --> 59:11.432
Where's the exit?

59:15.840 --> 59:17.354
RPG! RPG!

59:25.880 --> 59:27.872
Oh!

59:33.400 --> 59:34.595
Bradley!

59:46.440 --> 59:49.035
Whew, boys!

59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.116
It's okay, honey.
It's gonna be okay.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:03.192
It'll be okay, honey.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.750
Hey, Chappy, you can relax now.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.394
Chap!

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:29.711
Yeah, I'm good.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.719
Hey.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.911
- Found your ChapStick.
- Oh-ho-ho-ho!

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.554
Oh, Chappy,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.911
you are the man!

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.271
Mmm. Mmm, ah.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.594
Almost died
with cracked lips. Ha-ha!

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:48.394
Oh, that ain't even right.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.398
All right,
Whitsett, take us home.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.755
Whew!

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.200
Chaplain! Chaplain Turner.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.480
Falcon's trying to reach you.

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.557
It's an emergency at home, sir.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.998
- Darren?
- Heather?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.600
What took you so long?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.313
I'm sorry, babe. I-I was...

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:15.233
I was off-base,
and they couldn't reach me.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.518
Oh. It was horrible. Um...

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.916
- our little Elie...
- Elie?

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.077
E-Elie? What happened to Elie?
Is she okay?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.277
Yes. Yeah.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:26.880
She's fine. She's fine.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.400
She's stable now, thank God.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:29.840
Okay, what happened?

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.633
We were at the, uh,
at the Fall Festival,

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.797
and the kids
went through the maze,

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.680
and apparently
there was hay in there,

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.632
and I can't believe
I didn't check.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.798
- Where was her inhaler?
- I don't...

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.357
I don't know. I c...
can't really ask her right now.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.675
I'm sorry, it...

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.790
She's okay.
That's all that matters.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.992
- How are you?
- I am not okay.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.840
I can't stop shaking.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.555
Babe,
I really thought we lost her.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.353
But we didn't.

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.278
- She's okay.
- Look, I know.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.312
I know, honey.
This is just, like...

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:08.956
this was, like,
the hardest day by far

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.793
not to have you here.

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:12.070
Yeah, it sounds brutal.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.536
Th-There's someone there
with you, right?

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.176
Yeah. Yeah, I mean,
Tonya's here with the kids,

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.429
but, you know, she's not you.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.598
She's not Elie's dad,
and I just, I...

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.936
Babe, b-babe,
I understand, okay?

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.235
...feel so alone

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.034
in this right now,
and I just need...

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.753
Babe, I get it! Okay?

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.473
Okay.

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.279
Uh, what was that? I'm not...

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.871
I was just trying to tell you
that I... that I miss you.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.376
Well, if you knew
what happened to me today,

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.710
- if you had any idea...
- Okay.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.595
Then, um, why don't you
give me an idea for once?

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.359
I'm all ears.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.676
I have to... I got to go.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.473
What?

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.718
Darren, I just got you
on the phone!

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:51.956
I just got...

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.873
I'm sorry, I got to go.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.198
Babe?

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.152
Yeah, no, I mean, I have to go

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.112
check on Elie, too,
so I got to go, too.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.278
Okay. Keep me posted. I love...

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.834
All right, all right.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:47.749
Lieutenant Colonel Jacobsen
sprang to his sleigh

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:51.840
to unload a few rounds
of his M249 SAW.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.431
And the insurgents ran away

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.796
from his Yuletide shock
and awe.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.800
Come on now! Come on!

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.593
You know where it's at.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.599
But I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.394
"Merry Christmas to all,

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.513
and to all a good night!"

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.158
Ho ho ho ho!

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.557
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.034
Merry Christmas.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.640
Yeah!

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.479
- Troops! Troops!
- Yeah.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.116
Thank you. Thank you all
for your hard work,

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.833
your sacrifice,

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.599
and your service.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.080
- Hooah?
- Hooah!

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.034
Come and get it!

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.833
Merry Christmas. Here you go.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.713
Merry Christmas.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:41.593
Thank you, troops.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.679
Merry Christmas. Ho ho ho...

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.437

Hey, Chaplain.
This a good time?

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.317
Hey, Lance, come on in.

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.840
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.640
- How are you?
- I'm good. Good to see you.

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:21.234
Uh, for your generosity.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.272
I heard it was your wife
who set me up

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.800
with all those pictures
of Elijah.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.354
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:28.233
Man, can't wait to see my boy.

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.591
Won't be long now,
brother. Wow.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.915
More beef jerky.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.474
- I love it.
- I know, right?

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.239
- Really?
- Had to resist the whole way.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.720
What's that?
What you got going there?

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.240
- Easter service?
- Yep.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.874
You coming, man?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.719
You kidding me?

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.991
I am a genuine, 100%

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.520
bona fide believer, baby.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.154
I'm all in.
Of course I'm coming.

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:51.431
- All in?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.029
You just gave me a great idea.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.389
<i>Far more than me,</i>

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.319
you men and women know

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.794
what it is
to offer up your lives

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.195
for the good of others.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.551
And one of the many
challenges here

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:06.240
and at home
is that unless you've done it,

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.158
actually lived it,

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.511
it's hard to appreciate
what it takes

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.996
to make that sacrifice.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.238
Well, you know who else
actually lived it?

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.477
Who willingly
sacrificed His life

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.080
so that others could live?

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.954
Jesus.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.152
He came, He laid it down,

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:29.478
and He rose again
for me and for you

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:32.991
so that you and I can live.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.998
And if that act

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.520
doesn't give you hope
and confidence

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.114
in a God that loves you

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.590
and is willing
to do anything for you,

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.949
I don't know what will.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.114
And that's what this day,
Easter, is all about.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.118
Hope.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.118
For all of us.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.880
Now, if I've learned anything
about you guys,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.993
it's that you know how
to go all in.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.555
And there is no better day
than Easter to go all in

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.279
for Jesus.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.031
Army Specialist Lance Bradley,

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.791
I baptize you in the name
of the Father, the Son

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.399
and the Holy Spirit.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.069

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.559

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.792
All right, gather round.

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.319
Let's go!

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.160
All right.

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.760
Eyes alert.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.111
Scan the rooftops, windows.

01:09:00.279 --> 01:09:03.273
Watch the road,
grandmothers, kids,

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:05.915
livestock, bumps in the field.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:09.590
Follow the ROE, stay alive.

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.837
- Hooah?
- Hooah!

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.992
All right, hey, uh, Chaplain.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.350
Why don't you, uh,
why don't you do what you do?

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.357
- Give it to 'em, Chaplain.
- Here we go.

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:27.477
"The proud

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:29.871
"have laid their snares,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.754
"and along the path,
they have set traps

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.599
"to catch me.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.598
"But You...

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.871
You are my strong deliverer."

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.354
- All right, Chaplain.
- Yep.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:41.856
"You shield my head
in the day of battle."

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.029
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.710
"Do not grant the wicked
their desires.

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:48.796
"Do not let
their plans succeed.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.194
Amen."

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.470
Amen.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.557
Let's get it!

01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.518
Oh, hey, Chaplain.

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:59.040
You're not coming. What gives?

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.600
Not today.
I got a bunch of meetings.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.194
They want me
to start packing up.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.754
Hey, man, you don't need me.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.155
You got something better.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.555
See you tonight.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.155
Yes, sir.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.756
Bit too real?

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:25.839
Yeah, even for me.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.880
Didn't want to sugarcoat it.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.196
This is gonna have to wait
a few years.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.391
About ten before Sam reads it.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.439
And I am so glad that Heather
never has to watch these.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.837
Yeah.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.077
You know,
I've been worried about you.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.318
And before I forget,

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.875
thank you.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.469
You being here
has made a big difference

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.193
in where I'm heading
when I get back.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.391
As in...?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.830
Oh, I don't know.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:08.193
Thinking maybe I won't be
a half bad mom, after all.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.518
Probably won't fight
my mom as much.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.536
Wouldn't mean you want
to start carrying one of these,

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.472
would it?

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.551
I'm gonna miss you, Chaplain.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.831
You, too.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.429
Okay.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.600
Chicken Milanese.
- I don't even know what that is.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.016
I don't even know
about how you say that.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.872
We need to take a walk,
Chaplain.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.474
Just got the call
that Alpha and Bravo

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.816
were on their final
transition patrol,

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.719
and they hit an IED.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.799
All due respect, sir,
get to the point.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.392
I'm sorry.
I know he was a friend.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.193
We lost Lance Bradley.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.550
Anyone else?

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.240
Man nearest the blast,
Michael Lewis,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:09.113
went to pull Lance out
of the wreckage,

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.960
and there was
a second explosion.

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.879
From what I'm told,
he's gonna make it, but...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.674
I'm not too sure
about his legs.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.398
<i>Afraid.</i>

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.512
But you have told us

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:30.235
that we do not
have to be afraid.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:31.555
You're strong.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.672
You're brave.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.157
You are brave,
and you will weather this.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.158
You will weather this, okay?

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.840
- God.
- Okay, okay. Okay.

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.591
<i>Chaplain Turner,</i>

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.189
<i>sorry you lost your dad, too.</i>

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.233
<i>But believe me,
he had to love you.</i>

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.238
<i>And he'd be proud,</i>

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.000
<i>as proud
as any father could be.</i>

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.998
<i>Lance.</i>

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.032
<i>P.S. Enjoy the jerky.</i>

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.117
<i>You can pay me later.</i>

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.234
Medevac's here, Chaplain.
Ready in five.

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.479
<i>"The Lord is
the strength of my life;</i>

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.513
<i>"of whom shall I be afraid?</i>

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.111
"I remain confident of this,

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.200
and I will see the goodness
of the Lord..."

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.231
"...in the land of the living."

01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:07.670
You got this, Chaplain.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.474
We are blessed
to be among the living,

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.956
but going home,

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.278
we must prepare
for new challenges.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.720
Anxiety.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.675
Anger. Depression.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:28.317
Even ideas that somehow
not going on would be better.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.195
Reject these enemies
and ask for help.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.511
Just ask.

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.029
<i>Remember your armor,</i>

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.470
<i>guard your spirit,</i>

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.472
<i>and you will prevail.</i>

01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.199
<i>Welcome to Baghdad, people,</i>

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.074
<i>and your first day at
Forward Operating Base Falcon.</i>

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:07.432
<i>Today you join our fight</i>

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.756
<i>to destroy al-Qaeda
and her offspring,</i>

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.758
<i>to stabilize this nation</i>

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.879
<i>and keep America safe.</i>

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.199
You see him?

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.314
Daddy!

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.875
Yes.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.834
Mmm. You guys.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:07.873
When did you get so big, huh?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.311
Hi, baby. Hi. Hi.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.558
Hi.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.913
- Hey. Hey, Meribeth.
- Hey, Meribeth.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.111
- You see Daddy?
- Look at you.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.237
I love you.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.277
Look, your ribbon, Dad.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.397
Yellow means "welcome home."

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.496
Okay, honey,
when you're done with that,

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.696
- can you get your sister?
- Okay.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.359
Darren, dinner's ready!

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.960
Thanks, bud.
Can you get the bread?

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.958
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
- Darren!

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.833
Hey. Did you hear me?

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.917
Dinner's ready.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.634
Oh, yeah, Tonya and the girls
left last night

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:36.116
to join Michael at Walter Reed.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:41.917
Neighbor.

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:43.713
You're gonna be okay.

01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.799
Babe. Sorry. I...

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.917
Dinner's ready.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.191
Darren?

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.797
Babe?

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:23.554
Did I take up too much
of the bed?

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.637
No.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.240
Is there anything
I can do for you?

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.194
Just let me stay awake.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.554
That is really good news.

01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.592
I'm so glad
that you're doing okay.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.878
Maybe I'm still in shock.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.550
I don't know, but, yeah, okay.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.831
How about you?

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.270
Um...

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.153
a-another time.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.600
Hey, just keep me posted,

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.677
okay?

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.912
Tonya?

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:24.680
Uh... I will.

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.116
Bye.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.959
I love you girls so much.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.680
I'm so sorry.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.029
Look, I promise you both,

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:39.391
I-I'm gonna do things right
this time.

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.995
I mean it.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.555
I'm gonna be
the kind of man that...

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.552
I'm gonna be the kind of man

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.718
that all three of you
can be proud of.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.797
It's okay, Daddy.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.191
We already are.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.997
And to the Republic

01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:25.396
for which it stands,

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.557
one nation,

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.909
under God,

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.520
indivisible,

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.120
with liberty

01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.078
and justice for all.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.118
Take a seat, everyone. Thank you.
- Hi.

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.435
- Hi, hi. Sorry.
- Hey, Colby.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.836
- How you doing?
- So sorry we're late.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.555
It's just a little separation
anxiety happening today.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.194
- Colby.
- Oh, no.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.152
Not-not him. Me.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.715
Oh, Mom.
Oh, Mom's gonna be great.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.376
- Isn't she? Come on in, Colby.
- Yeah.

01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:51.834
I'm glad you're here today.

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.838
You know, it wouldn't
have been the same thing

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.235
without you being here.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.829
Okay.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:00.111
Okay.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.553
Darren?

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.195
Darren? What's going on?

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.678
- Is everything okay?
- Shh!

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.576
- Is there someone outside?
- I said stop talking.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.751
You're scaring me.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.952
Baby. Baby, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.793
- Don't touch me!
- Okay.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.752
Okay.

01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.240
Please, just go to bed.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.830
It's 3:00
in the morning, Darren.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.111
Where have you been?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.153
One of the guys at the base
had a crisis.

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:04.317
You missed dinner
and bedtime again.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.680
Darren!

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:13.553
Are you kidding me with this?

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.990
- Shh! I just got the kids down!
- Does anyone ever run

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.120
this thing?

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:18.355
- Let me see that.
- No.

01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:19.696
I'm going to the base
to get stitches.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:21.393
Fine, yeah, whatever.
Walk away.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.638
I've been doing just fine on
my own for the past 17 months.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.880
I'm sorry, what-what
is that supposed to mean?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.315
- I'm back, I'm here.
- No.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.318
No, you're not... here.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.159
Not with me.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.397
Not with the kids.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:38.398
I've been patient...

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:39.590
and compassionate.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.240
I've given you space.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.480
I have run interference
with the kids to protect them.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.600
- Oh, God, protect them from what?
- I don't know!

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:48.360
That's the point, because I
don't recognize you like this.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.195
You're angry...

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.754
and distant...

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.200
and mean.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:56.357
And-and what kills me
is that I know you know

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.517
how to show up, because
Tonya won't stop talking

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.472
about how you keep
showing up for Michael.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.193
'Cause he's been
through something.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.233
- I've been through something!
- Really? What? Hmm?

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.999
Oh, I don't know,
maybe just raising

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.470
our three small children alone,

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.159
partner-less.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:14.193
And on top of that, Darren,

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.993
I have been holding

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.476
wailing, sobbing wives,

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.240
mothers, and their babies
in my arms.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.956
I have seen and I have felt
their hearts torn to shreds,

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.720
and you don't think that
I've been through something?

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.514
- So you want to make this a competition?
- No! I just...

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.552
I want to know why.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.434
I want to know why
you somehow have it in you

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:39.474
to show up for those men
when you refuse to do it

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.000
for your own wife and kids.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.998
Because those men need me!

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.351
I need you!

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.475
Your children need you.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.750
You don't get it.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.519
You will never get it.

01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.592
I can't even look at you
right now, and I can't do this.

01:25:57.720 --> 01:25:59.996
I need stitches.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.480
Wow.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:12.512
I see the word "dead."

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.711
But who is

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.240
Cosgrove?

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.110
What in the world
are you doing?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.760
We just wanted to read it.
- It doesn't matter what you wanted.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:26.390
- But I gave it to you so we...
- So it's mine!

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.910
And you can read it
when I say you can.

01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:30.720
What is going on?!
What did you do to them!

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.256
- I didn't do anything!
- Please, don't fight

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.033
- 'cause of us.
- I told them

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.355
to stay out of my stuff!

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.994
Enough, Darren! Get out!

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.158
Go! You are no longer welcome
in this house.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:43.000
No,
I am not leaving my family.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.520
You need help.

01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:47.394
And I can't give it to you.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.479
Go to the base
and get some help.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.710
Get out!

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.240
<i>I mean, by the end,</i>

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.113
<i>I couldn't even stand
to listen to myself.</i>

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.674
Dishing out faith as reality

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:42.235
just kept cutting
the legs out from under me.

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.275
Oh, what is wrong with me?

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:50.193
What if Michael were here?

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.720
Relax, Darren.
He's not here.

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.616
And you wouldn't have said it
if he were here.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:55.472
Wouldn't I?
I can't believe half the things

01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:56.829
I said to my family.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.434
Everything
that Lance and Michael

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.472
started to buy into,
and now one's dead

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.274
and one's a dad
with his leg blown off.

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.915
Why would Michael
ever believe me now?

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.111
Let me just see
if you hear what I just heard.

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.959
You...

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:12.072
stopped liking hearing you
talk about God.

01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:15.796
And you were afraid reality
would undercut your message

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.912
and Michael's ability
to believe in you.

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.560
Give me a break.
You know what I meant.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.193
I think I do.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.314
And like any of us who have
tried to help anyone trust God,

01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:27.511
the enemy got you
trusting you and...

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.871
No, I trusted in God
to protect those men,

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.595
- and He didn't!
- No.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.279
No, you trusted in God

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.676
to do what you thought
He ought to do.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.510
You show me a believer,
and I'll show you someone

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.439
who's done the exact
same thing, or is about to.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.951
All of us have doubted, son.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:52.196
I'm not sure there is faith
without some doubt.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.072
Had a number of vets work
for us in the past, but...

01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.318
never a chaplain.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.949
After 15 months in the desert,

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:09.197
are you sure you want to...

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:11.636
come work in the dirt?

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.069
It's a different kind
of dirt, sir.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.352
Different kind of dirt.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:32.633
I'll never forget what Michael
did, trying to save him.

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.838
And Michael would do it again.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.917
Ten times over.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.351
Especially where
his heart's at now.

01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:44.637
It's so...

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:47.116
bittersweet.

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.558
Hey.

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:55.194
Hmm?

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.312
It's gonna be okay.

01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.352
Oh. Don't worry about me.

01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:02.672
Why not?

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.678
Pain is pain.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.077
And ours doesn't make yours
any less real.

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.440
What is it?

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.072
The three of us
are just carrying

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.396
so much of it, you know?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.196
Having a real hard time
seeing God's goodness

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.277
in all of it.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:31.998
Here's what I know, honey.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.319
That IED returned
my Michael to me

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.433
and to our girls.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.870
He's a different man now.

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.474
And if that's not evidence

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.671
that there's a good God
working here,

01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.554
bringing us something better
through pain...

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.399
what is?

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:55.754
So all I got to do is trust
He knows what He's doing.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.997
Which better be true

01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:01.875
because it's all that's
keeping this girl together.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.676
I think the kids understand

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.554
that you're sorry
about the way you treated them.

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.400
But as for the two of you,

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:23.079
I'd like to recommend

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.556
you start reliving
good memories.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.320
Remind one another
of what you had

01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:30.909
before you try to build
something new.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:33.635
Heather, can you pick one?

01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.280
One?

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.198
Sure. Um...

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:41.476
I guess the day we met.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.589
I was taking photos on campus,

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:48.280
and he drove by, staring at me

01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:50.716
and crashed his motorcycle

01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.435
straight into my shot
of the chrysanthemums.

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:55.677
Ruined them both.

01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:59.636
But then turned out later
he was the guest speaker

01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.240
at my campus ministries, and...

01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.432
I saw this man
with a heart for God.

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.916
Darren?

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:10.317
What you got?

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:14.110
Well, this is where we are.

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:16.596
Anything that truly matters...

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.513
shutdown.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.996
Memories are just...

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.273
I mean, every time
I try to think back,

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.519
the... the things that I don't
want to remember take over.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:34.235
Like there's... there's a wall

01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:36.551
in my timeline...

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.592
That's normal, Darren.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.474
It's normal.

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.829
And, Heather,

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.952
post-traumatic stress is a...

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:46.600
it's a mind inhibitor.

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.234
You'll want to think
of one thing,

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.760
and it gets slammed
by something

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.236
you don't want
to ever see again.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.955
It takes time...

01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.436
and intentional rebuilding
of tools and muscles

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.916
that we use
to control our thoughts.

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.509
- I'm pretty much out of time.
- Darren...

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:05.593
I'm not putting a clock
on this; that's not fair.

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.200
Well, what do
you want me to say?

01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:12.033
I was angry.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.753
At God.

01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:16.236
At myself.

01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.754
Afraid of the pain.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.712
Afraid that I was some imposter

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:23.629
because... my faith
had let us down.

01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.116
So just tell me
that stuff, then.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:28.471
Fear,

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.672
anger, pain...
I can handle that stuff.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.474
I can.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.671
What I can't handle
is the distance.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:40.436
You shutting me out
and pushing me away.

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.279
I mean, that's what hur...

01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.710
that's what hurts.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.320
That's what scares me to death.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.159
You're my best friend,

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.033
and you've been treating me
like a stranger,

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.039
and I don't get it. Why?

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:58.516
Why the distance
and the silence with me

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:02.156
when you can just come in here
and lay it all out for him?

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.516
Because I'm ashamed.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.437
I know I'm failing you.

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:12.555
And I want to make it better,
but I just...

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.479
I don't know how.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.910
I loved those men,

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:20.111
and He took 'em away,

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.995
and I'm supposed to get that
and be okay, but I'm not.

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.840
I'm terrified...

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.433
...because I love you
and the kids so much more.

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:44.354
Well, that was fun.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.755
Some, uh...

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.952
Light reading
and viewing material.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.030
When you're up for it.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:21.113
Thank you.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.155
Still living
on your knees, I see.

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.397
Hey, man.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.398
Didn't hear you coming.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.994
Yeah, well...

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.351
set it to stealth mode.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.637
Standard military issue.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.759
I'm glad you're back.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.156
Yeah, see, that's...
that's the problem.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:10.358
I'm back, but...
my neighbor's gone.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.393
Chaplain Rodgers
has been helpful,

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.830
helping me see
what I lost track of.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.276
Your armor, brother,
that's what.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.960
It's a bit more complicated
than that.

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:25.912
Oh.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.191
Okay. So, uh...

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.516
why are you so angry?

01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:32.911
Yeah, our wives are friends,
man, I heard all about it.

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.952
Well, then you
don't need me to tell you.

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:36.912
- Hey, I'm not the angry one.
- Come on, man.

01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:38.640
- What, are you angry at your wife?
- No.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:39.760
- Or at me?
- No.

01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:40.836
Well, then who? Yourself?

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:42.838
- Darn right.
- No, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:44.440
That's not it.
Now, come on, Chaplain,

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:46.079
"belt of truth" me up.

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.715
All right, 'cause you been in
my face since the day we met.

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:56.355
It's a coin for a con man.

01:36:56.480 --> 01:36:58.392
'Cause you can't tell me,
that's what you are.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.034
I'm afraid, all right,

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.456
of exactly...
- Oh, I didn't ask if you were afraid!

01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.675
I asked why you're so angry!

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:05.031
Are you... are you kidding me?

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.674
Look at you.

01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:09.071
Look at Lance.
Look at me.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.079
God is my life.

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.476
And what was He thinking, huh?

01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.996
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:19.351
Listen to me, brother.

01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:22.513
When I picked that piece
of tin up out the dirt,

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.440
I never thought that
it promised I'd come back

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.233
in one piece...
neither did Lance.

01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.995
A few minutes after the blast,

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.680
Lance knew
he was slipping away.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.679
His head was bleeding,
he was fading.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.110
But you know
what he said to me?

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.755
He said he was glad

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.112
he wore... His helmet.

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.078
Yeah. Yeah, he wasn't talking

01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.998
about government issue.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.873
His helmet of salvation.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.320
Yeah.

01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:53.750
You gave that to him, Darren.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:55.837
All right? I...
I watched him go

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.794
with a peaceful smile
on his face.

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.913
Because of you,
he was prepared.

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.271
Because of you, I got prepared.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.239
The only reason why
I'm still here is because...

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.631
I got to do things right
this time.

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.032
So, no, look...

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:17.279
don't you go losing your faith
on account of me and Lance.

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.831
I don't want that on my head.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.878
Yeah.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.595
So, listen, um...

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:36.400
what you gonna do
about that woman of yours?

01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.078

you gave her a call?

I especially love
photographing people,

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.073
capturing expressions
and smiles,

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.351
memories, moments that they'll

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.711
never live exactly
the same way ever again,

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.349
and just saving them forever.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.674
Because you never know,

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:05.235
when you take someone's photo,

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.114
what it might mean
to someone someday.

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.517
And that's why
I love being a photographer.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:12.960
Thank you so much
for listening.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.037
Thank you, Mrs. Turner.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.311
And next to share,
we have Elie's dad,

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:19.875
Darren Turner.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.231
Thank you for accepting
my invitation, Mr. Turner.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.320
It's my pleasure.
Um... hi, guys.

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:29.114
Uh, so I work
at the Digger O'Dell Nursery,

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:34.076
and I'm in charge of the trees
and plants and flowers.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:37.318
Like... chrysanthemums.

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.600
Until a few months ago, I was
a chaplain for the U.S. Army.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:56.677
A, uh, true soldier
feels so deeply

01:40:56.800 --> 01:40:58.871
that good people deserve
to be safe and free,

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.639
that he is willing

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.070
to risk losing
the most valuable of things

01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.550
just to go and help them.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.471
And every soldier who serves in
a war comes back with a medal.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:13.478
It's just that
sometimes you can't see it,

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.319
'cause it's on the inside.

01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.274
I don't feel like a hero,

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.474
'cause to me...

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.678
the true heroes
are the soldiers' families

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.157
who also have medals
on the inside

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.511
pinned to their hearts.

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:41.151
Like I know my family does.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:14.478
Heather, please...

01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:16.478
know that I love you,

01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:19.434
and I have
since the first day we met.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:22.871
When I ruined those flowers

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.560
you were taking pictures of.

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:28.354
Chrysanthemums, right?

01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:30.915
Who the heck
names flowers, anyway?

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.797
I miss you more
than you can imagine.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.677
And love you just the same.

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.399
Oh, God.

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:56.038
I am hurting.

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.630
But so is the man that I love.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:06.598
Please forgive me

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:09.872
for judging
what I don't understand

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:14.631
and for leaning on him when
I should be leaning on You.

You did all this?

01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:07.880
I wanted to do
something special for you.

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.715
So I enjoyed
some light reading

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:29.196
and viewing materials
the other night.

01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:34.389
Babe, I thought I knew,
but I had no idea.

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:36.398
What you lived through.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.318
What you had to carry.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.274
What you're still
carrying right now.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.392
I'm so sorry.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:47.318
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:51.719
And I get it now. You know,
you did want to talk to me.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.959
It was that moment before
we got married, you know?

01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.478
You were standing in the rain
as I changed your tire.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.637
What about it?

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.275
One of my favorite memories.

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:15.596
What?

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:18.792
I had just broken up with you
for a second time.

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.798
Yeah.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:23.276
But you called me.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:28.080
So I knew it wasn't over.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.799
I missed you.

01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.994
Military's missing a good man.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.079
Chaplain Rodgers, sir.

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.157
- It's good to see you, Darren.
- You, too.

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.670
I hear things have really
turned around for you guys.

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:12.837
Yeah, and I plan
to keep it that way.

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.952
Home is the best place to be.

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:17.037
Hmm.

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.039
I got a call from a good friend

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.072
at Fort Campbell.

01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.796
Their Special Forces team needs
a chaplain.

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:30.152
Now, Special Forces deployments
are limited and brief.

01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:32.078
You'd even get the promotion

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.477
to Captain
that Jacobsen wanted for you.

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.998
I'm honored, sir.

01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.351
I truly am.

01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.040
But I'm sorry.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:47.837
Like I said...

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.957
military's missing a good man.

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:53.556
Hey, guys.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.070
I think I hear some action
brewing at Fort Bumblefoot.

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.590
Meet you there in 2.5 seconds!

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:01.150
- Wow.
- Last one there's a rotten egg!

01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:06.759
You know, I think we should
probably bring the fort with us

01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.190
when we move.

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.710
When you take the job.

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.590
What are you talking about?

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.791
I heard it
through the grapevine,

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.435
so I called Chaplain Rodgers
myself.

01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.029
Who are you,

01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:25.271
and what have you done
with my wife?

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.079
Look, we know
what to expect now.

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.157
We know how to prepare.

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:38.274
Look, you and I both know

01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:41.757
this is what
we're called to... Captain.

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:47.198
It's who we're called to.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.312
Right?

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.000
Hmm?

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.474
<i>To all who shall see</i>

01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.159
<i>these presents, greeting.</i>

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.476
This is to certify

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:01.115
that the president of
the United States of America,

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:03.715
authorized by executive order,

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.958
has awarded
the Bronze Star medal

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:11.239
to Captain Darren A. Turner,
United States Army.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.517
You may be seated.

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.352
Thank you very much.

01:50:47.480 --> 01:50:51.360
This is, uh... deeply humbling.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:58.200
It is with great honor
that I have served my country.

01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.596
But I only stand
before you today

01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:03.838
because Jesus is my rock.

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:07.510
And because I have a family
who loves and believes in me,

01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:11.594
and friends
that never gave up on me.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.792
And it's also why I can
and will continue

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:19.278
to serve as I've been asked,
to the very best of my ability.

01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.911
My family and I...

01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.271
we made a promise to each other

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.754
to protect ourselves
from anything

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.280
that might try to divide us.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.757
And we've found
that the best way to do that

01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:33.758
is to put on the Armor of God.

01:51:33.880 --> 01:51:36.839
<i>So today I encourage you</i>

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.072
<i>to wear, by faith,</i>

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.954
<i>the belt of God's truth.</i>

01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:46.198
<i>The breastplate
of His righteousness.</i>

01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.397
<i>Sandals of His peace.</i>

01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:52.440
<i>The shield of faith
in His power</i>

01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:54.159
<i>against all enemies.</i>

01:51:56.040 --> 01:52:00.000
<i>The helmet of salvation,
found in Him.</i>

01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.751
<i>And the sword of His powerful
and gracious spirit.</i>

01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:09.792
Before I left for Iraq,
I thought I knew

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.479
what it meant
to put on that armor.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.990
Here's what I learned.

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:18.796
No one is promised tomorrow.

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.316
So I'm choosing to put my faith
in the one who holds

01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:24.194
all my tomorrows.

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:26.551
As for me and my family...

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.592
it's the only way to live.

01:52:52.680 --> 01:52:54.512
- Hey, buddy. You must be Colby.
- Hi.

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:56.438
- Shonda, hi.
- Hi. Yes.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:58.336
- So nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

01:52:58.360 --> 01:52:59.714
Pleasure.

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:00.840
What's this?

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:04.592
Bars look good on you, sir.

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.439
Yeah. Look taller, right?

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.233
Yeah, a little bit.
Little bit.

01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:14.512
I had my eye on you, Captain.

01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:18.310
It's why I'm here,
why... we're here.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.557
