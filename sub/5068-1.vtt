I got the Strangler. Wabash and Van Buren.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.654
Oh, shit.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.511
Oh, shit!

01:17.595 --> 01:19.305
Jack, get the van.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.507
Eddie, help me!

01:21.590 --> 01:25.152
Eddie, Eddie, don't leave me! God, no!

01:42.244 --> 01:44.330
Give it up, Ray. It's over.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.164
Oh, God, I'm dying.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.670
You hear this, you son of a bitch?

03:16.630 --> 03:18.591
I'm gonna get you for it!

03:20.676 --> 03:22.845
I'm gonna get you,

03:22.928 --> 03:28.008
and I'm gonna get Eddie, no matter what!

03:41.864 --> 03:43.983
I gotta find somebody.

03:45.201 --> 03:47.277
I gotta find somebody.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.293
I don't know. I gotta find somebody.

03:56.128 --> 03:57.922
Gotta find somebody.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.507
Give me the power, I beg of you!

06:23.859 --> 06:27.238
<i>I have no friends. No one will play with me.</i>

06:28.155 --> 06:31.575
<i>Uh-oh. There's a friend in need.</i>

06:32.284 --> 06:33.828
<i>Hey, cheer up.</i>

06:33.911 --> 06:36.914
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- <i>I'm a Good Guy.</i>

06:36.997 --> 06:41.877
<i>I've just come from the Good Guy Clubhouse,
and I'll be your friend to the end.</i>

06:41.961 --> 06:45.256
<i>You will? You mean you'll be my friend now?</i>

06:46.173 --> 06:47.762
<i>Sure, I will.</i>

06:47.842 --> 06:49.476
<i>Hidey-ho.</i>

06:50.928 --> 06:52.721
I saw this one.

06:55.891 --> 07:00.149
<i>Hidey hidey ho
Best friends till the end</i>

07:00.229 --> 07:03.444
<i>When you're feeling down or feeling blue</i>

07:03.524 --> 07:06.280
<i>A Good Guy will always be there for you</i>

07:06.360 --> 07:09.822
<i>Because a Good Guy is your true blue friend</i>

07:09.905 --> 07:12.366
<i>He's your best friend till the end</i>

07:13.617 --> 07:16.787
<i>All right, good guys,
that's our Good Guys show for today,</i>

07:16.871 --> 07:18.247

Good Guy message just for you.</i>

07:25.212 --> 07:28.716
<i>Hi, Good Guys. Boy, have I got news for you.</i>

<i>Now you can have your very own Good Guy doll.</i>

<i>You can have all the adventures
we have on TV in your very own home.</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:41.812
<i>Good Guys say three different sentences.</i>

07:41.896 --> 07:45.653
<i>We even turn our heads
and blink our eyes when you talk to us.</i>

07:45.733 --> 07:47.234
<i>Right, Oscar?</i>

07:47.735 --> 07:52.339
<i>Hi, I'm Oscar, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.</i>

07:53.407 --> 07:55.242
Wow!

07:55.701 --> 07:58.666
<i>Every Good Guy has a name all his own,</i>

07:58.746 --> 08:01.415
<i>so he can be your very own best friend.</i>

08:01.957 --> 08:05.294
<i>So remember to tell Mom and Dad
you want a Good Guy.</i>

08:05.795 --> 08:09.215
<i>Perfect for birthdays or just any old time.</i>

08:10.216 --> 08:15.221
<i>And remember, you can buy
all of our Good Guy accessories, too.</i>

08:15.763 --> 08:18.318

08:32.488 --> 08:34.030
Mommy, wake up.

08:37.118 --> 08:38.327
Mommy.

08:41.914 --> 08:43.666
Mommy, wake up.

08:48.129 --> 08:50.089
Mommy, wake up.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.259
- Wake up, Mommy. Wake up.
- Andy.

08:56.679 --> 08:58.559
What time is it, Andy?

08:58.639 --> 09:02.518
- Wake up.
- 6:30. It's only 6:30 in the morning.

09:06.397 --> 09:09.817
But it's a beautiful day outside. See?

09:11.819 --> 09:13.446
It certainly is.

09:13.821 --> 09:17.158
- How long you been up, birthday boy?
- Since forever.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.744
I made you breakfast in bed.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.496
You did? Oh, God.

09:23.789 --> 09:25.291
Well, thanks.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.544
Well, this looks just excellent.

09:31.589 --> 09:33.469
I'll tell you what.

09:33.549 --> 09:35.759
Why don't I eat this
just a little later, okay?

09:35.843 --> 09:36.802
Mmm-hmm.

09:37.470 --> 09:42.186
But first, I gotta give you
your super-duper birthday tummy-gummy.

09:42.266 --> 09:44.894
Come here. Come here. Come here.

09:47.229 --> 09:50.399
That's one.
How many years old are you today? Two.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.822
Happy birthday, pumpkin.

09:52.902 --> 09:56.906
Thanks. Can we open my presents now, Mommy?

09:57.156 --> 09:59.533
- Yes, we can.
- Terrific!

10:01.702 --> 10:04.246
<i>Good morning, Chicago.
Leading off at this hour,</i>

10:04.330 --> 10:08.125
<i>Charles Lee Ray, the notorious
Lake Shore Strangler was shot and killed</i>

10:08.209 --> 10:11.507
<i>shortly before 3:00 a.m.
this morning on Wabash Avenue.</i>

10:11.587 --> 10:14.844
Can I open this first, Mommy? Can I, can I?

10:14.924 --> 10:18.427
Andy, don't you want to start
with the smaller one first?

10:19.428 --> 10:21.180
Okay, go ahead.

10:27.686 --> 10:31.273
Well, what do you think?
You need these clothes so badly.

10:31.690 --> 10:35.820
I think they're gonna be okay. We'll just
have to take them up just a couple of inches.

10:38.614 --> 10:40.825
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

10:42.159 --> 10:44.620
Oh, I know. You want some toys, don't you?

10:44.703 --> 10:46.580
Not boring old clothes.

10:48.207 --> 10:49.792
Try the other one.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.885
Well, what do you think?

10:55.965 --> 10:59.889
- I want a Good Guy to go with it.
- I know you do, Andy.

10:59.969 --> 11:03.055
But I didn't know about it
in time this month to save up for it.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.024
- Karen.
- Hi.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.780
You know that doll that you wanted for Andy?

11:15.860 --> 11:17.653
- The one that costs 100 bucks?
- Yeah, the Good Guy doll.

11:17.736 --> 11:20.990
There is a peddler in the alley behind
the store, and I think he's got one.

11:21.073 --> 11:22.370
What? What would a peddler
be doing with a doll?

11:22.450 --> 11:24.994
Who cares? Would you grab your purse
and come on? We can get a deal on it.

11:25.077 --> 11:27.458
- But I can't just leave my counter.
- Do you want the damn doll or don't you?

11:27.538 --> 11:29.543
- Of course I do.
- Well, then, come on.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.833
- Come on.
- All right.

11:34.378 --> 11:35.796
There he is.

11:39.842 --> 11:41.385
Okay, show her.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.932
Well, is it a Good Guy or not?

11:47.308 --> 11:49.143
It is. It is.

11:49.226 --> 11:51.771
- Yeah, well, I told you.
- How much do you want for it?

11:51.854 --> 11:52.855
50 bucks.

11:52.938 --> 11:54.398
- 10 and not a penny more.
- 30.

11:54.482 --> 11:56.570
What, are you kidding?
That thing is not worth $30.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.903
Enough. Take it or leave it.
Somebody else will buy it.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.988
- I'll take it.
- Karen, it's too much money.

12:01.071 --> 12:03.365
No, it isn't. You have no idea
how much Andy wants this doll.

12:03.449 --> 12:05.201
But we don't even know
if the damn thing works.

12:05.284 --> 12:08.207
Here you go, lady.
May it bring you and your kid a lot of joy.

12:08.287 --> 12:11.127
- Thank you.
- Hey, hold on, you!

12:11.207 --> 12:13.918
How do we know the damn thing isn't stolen?

12:14.168 --> 12:16.754
- Steal this.
- Steal this yourself.

12:17.046 --> 12:19.256
- Maggie.
- I think I dated him.

12:19.965 --> 12:22.468
Come on. We gotta get back to work.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.644
Andy's gonna love it!

12:28.724 --> 12:31.852
Mrs. Barclay, so nice of you to drop by.
Have a nice break?

12:31.936 --> 12:33.437
I'm sorry, Mr. Criswell.
I was only gone for a minute.

12:33.521 --> 12:37.108
Have a heart, Criswell. We were just downstairs
buying her little boy a birthday present.

12:37.191 --> 12:40.528
We have specified break times
for activities like that, Miss Peterson.

12:40.611 --> 12:43.114
Mrs. Howe has taken sick,
and we're shorthanded tonight.

12:43.197 --> 12:44.782
You'll have to fill in for her.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.288
I can't. I have to pick up my son
at the day care center in an hour.

12:47.368 --> 12:50.458
- I'm sorry, this is an emergency.
- Wait a second. I'll take over for her.

12:50.538 --> 12:54.208
Miss Peterson, you work in shoes,
not in jewelry.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.835
You'll just simply have to do it.

12:55.918 --> 12:59.338
Now, you can take off at 5:00,
but you'll have to be back at 9:00.

12:59.630 --> 13:00.798
It's my son's birthday.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.801
Mrs. Barclay,
are you happy with your job here?

13:03.884 --> 13:04.844
Yes, of course I am.

13:04.927 --> 13:09.014
- Then I suggest that...
- Hey. Chill out, would you, Walter?

13:10.099 --> 13:12.476
- I'll take care of Andy for you.
- Maggie, you can't do it again.

13:12.560 --> 13:15.691
Don't be silly.
It'll be the hottest date I've had in months.

13:15.771 --> 13:17.565
I can't imagine why.

13:26.949 --> 13:30.411
- Hey, where are you going?
- <i>Good Guys</i> are on TV.

13:30.494 --> 13:33.247
Well, I may have something better for you.

13:33.497 --> 13:34.582
What?

13:36.667 --> 13:38.461
This isn't groceries.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.563
A Good Guy! I knew it!

13:54.643 --> 13:56.899
I knew you'd get me one.

13:56.979 --> 13:59.064
Show me how he works, okay?

13:59.356 --> 14:03.277
Hi, I'm Andy. What's your name?

14:04.320 --> 14:09.366
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.

14:10.993 --> 14:13.287
Wow! He's something, isn't he?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.040
Oh, Mom, thanks.

14:18.209 --> 14:20.085
You're welcome, honey.

14:39.730 --> 14:41.569
See, that's how you build things.

Hey, wanna play?

Aunt Maggie,
Chucky wants to watch the 9:00 news.

15:28.529 --> 15:30.030
Sure he does.

15:32.908 --> 15:34.785
Okay, kid, off we go.

15:34.869 --> 15:36.704
Come on. There we go.

15:39.165 --> 15:42.084
- Chucky.
- Oh, yes, Chucky.

15:43.461 --> 15:45.754
You, too. Off we go.

15:48.924 --> 15:52.553

15:54.972 --> 15:56.682
Okay? Agreed?

15:57.224 --> 15:59.310
Good. Okay.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.521
You yell when you're ready

16:04.523 --> 16:08.051
Hey, Chucky, want to see my room?

16:23.459 --> 16:25.920
Andy, are you brushing your teeth?

16:26.086 --> 16:27.838

17:18.138 --> 17:20.683
- About what?
- Come on. Come on.

17:22.518 --> 17:26.689
You know, you have to learn
that when I say something, I mean it.

17:26.939 --> 17:30.404
- But what did I do?
- You know what I'm talking about.

17:30.484 --> 17:33.028
Turning the TV on
and putting Chucky in front of it

17:33.112 --> 17:35.489
when I told you it was time to go to bed.

17:35.573 --> 17:38.117
- I didn't do that.
- Oh, no? What did Chucky do?

17:38.200 --> 17:41.412
Walk into the living room
and turn it on all by himself?

17:41.495 --> 17:43.250
Did you do that, Chucky?

17:43.330 --> 17:46.667
Andy, stop it.
Now, come on, under the covers. Hurry.

17:47.585 --> 17:51.422
- But, Auntie...
- Under the covers and not another word.

17:51.755 --> 17:55.009
But I didn't put Chucky in front of the TV.

17:55.593 --> 17:57.344
Enough. Okay?

17:58.471 --> 18:00.014
Give me a kiss.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.225

18:03.309 --> 18:05.269

<i>I missed you, my dear.</i>

18:52.274 --> 18:54.568
<i>I was afraid you weren't going to show up.</i>

18:55.236 --> 18:56.987
<i>Too bad about the accident.</i>

18:57.321 --> 18:59.490
<i>Yes. Papa told us they just found it.</i>

19:00.407 --> 19:01.662
<i>How did you know?</i>

19:01.742 --> 19:03.119
<i>I must have heard it somewhere.</i>

19:03.202 --> 19:04.995
<i>I haven't seen you in so long, darling.</i>

19:05.079 --> 19:07.331
<i>I mean, couldn't we take a little walk,
or something?</i>

19:07.414 --> 19:09.792
<i>It looks as though you haven't had
a breath of fresh air in days.</i>

19:09.875 --> 19:11.172
- <i>A walk?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

19:11.252 --> 19:14.588
<i>The air outside will do you good.
Besides, you'll work up an appetite.</i>

19:14.672 --> 19:15.798
<i>Please.</i>

19:15.881 --> 19:17.424
<i>But, Janice, surely it's going to rain.</i>

19:42.366 --> 19:43.451
Andy?

19:44.285 --> 19:45.995
<i>Depends on whether there's an indictment.</i>

19:46.078 --> 19:48.247
<i>Well, they don't always...</i>

20:20.404 --> 20:22.072
Andy, is that you?

21:58.085 --> 21:59.870
How did that happen?

22:00.880 --> 22:02.343
Uh... Hello?

22:02.423 --> 22:04.717
Hi. How's it going? How's Andy?

22:05.593 --> 22:06.594
<i>Karen?</i>

22:06.677 --> 22:09.221
Yeah. Who else would it be?
Is something wrong?

22:09.722 --> 22:10.723
Uh...

22:10.806 --> 22:12.391
No.

22:13.851 --> 22:15.519
Everything's fine.

22:16.812 --> 22:19.110
Are you sure?
You don't sound like everything's fine.

22:19.190 --> 22:23.861
No, I just had a bit of
the alone-at-night willies. You know?

22:23.944 --> 22:26.701
Now, would you stop worrying

22:26.781 --> 22:29.392
and give Criswell a kick in the pants for me?

22:30.701 --> 22:31.952
You got it.

22:32.036 --> 22:34.330
Hey, listen, Maggie.
Thank you for everything.

22:34.413 --> 22:35.956
You're a real pal.

22:36.332 --> 22:37.500
Oh, yeah?

22:37.583 --> 22:41.378
Yeah, yeah. Give Andy a kiss for me,
will you? See you soon. Bye.

23:20.501 --> 23:22.378
What is wrong with me?

23:23.003 --> 23:25.422
I'm scaring myself half to death.

23:55.661 --> 23:57.413
Step away from this barricade.

23:57.496 --> 24:00.336
Come on, move it back.
There's nothing to see.

24:00.416 --> 24:02.418
Now, let's move this police line back here.

24:02.501 --> 24:04.545
Go on home, folks, please.

24:15.681 --> 24:17.767
She was on the sixth floor.

24:28.944 --> 24:30.866
Miss, what do you think you're doing?

24:30.946 --> 24:32.364
I live here.

24:38.913 --> 24:39.997
Andy?

24:41.749 --> 24:43.793
Oh, no. Andy?

24:45.377 --> 24:46.504
Andy?

24:47.421 --> 24:48.718
Andy!

24:48.798 --> 24:49.965
Mommy!

24:50.758 --> 24:52.259
Oh, thank God.

24:53.427 --> 24:55.137
Are you all right?

24:55.221 --> 24:57.852
Oh, I'm so glad. I got so scared when I...

24:57.932 --> 25:00.184
What's wrong? Where's Maggie?

25:00.684 --> 25:04.688
- She had an accident.
- Accident? What kind of an accident?

25:04.772 --> 25:07.862
Mrs. Barclay,
I'm Detective Mike Norris, Homicide.

25:07.942 --> 25:10.031
Could I talk to you out in the hall?

25:10.111 --> 25:12.863
- Why? What's happened to Maggie?
- Please?

25:15.157 --> 25:16.909
I'll be right back.

25:25.209 --> 25:27.002
Look, Mrs. Barclay...

25:34.301 --> 25:35.386
What?

25:36.011 --> 25:38.848
- Miss Peterson's dead, Mrs. Barclay.
- What?

25:42.017 --> 25:44.770
- How?
- She fell from your kitchen window.

25:45.271 --> 25:46.814
Oh, no.

25:49.358 --> 25:50.901
You all right?

25:51.902 --> 25:53.362
- Yes.
- All right.

25:53.654 --> 25:54.864
Come on.

25:59.410 --> 26:00.870
Oh, Maggie.

26:01.412 --> 26:02.872
Did you check over here?

26:06.459 --> 26:07.835
Oh, Maggie.

26:12.631 --> 26:14.967
You got any idea what these are?

26:20.055 --> 26:21.140
No.

26:21.599 --> 26:25.394
They look like footprints, don't they?
Very small footprints.

26:26.312 --> 26:28.189
What are you implying?

26:28.564 --> 26:30.111
I don't know.

26:30.191 --> 26:32.067
What would Andy be doing
up on the counter, right?

26:32.151 --> 26:33.114
- What?
- Besides,

26:33.194 --> 26:36.784
I already checked his closet.
None of his shoes matched these prints.

26:36.864 --> 26:39.787
Mommy? Mommy?

26:39.867 --> 26:42.832
Chucky wanted to know what was going on.

26:42.912 --> 26:45.623
Andy, I want you to go to bed.
The detective and I are very busy.

26:45.706 --> 26:48.209
- But, Mom...
- Right now, please.

26:50.377 --> 26:51.504
Andy.

26:52.213 --> 26:54.048
What do you got on your feet?

26:54.924 --> 26:57.760
Good Guy PJ sneakers.

26:57.843 --> 26:59.804
Wow. Come here.

27:02.556 --> 27:05.184
- Can I see the bottoms of them?
- Sure.

27:06.185 --> 27:09.480
Look at this. There's a gun.
Is that a cowboy hat?

27:09.563 --> 27:12.695
Andy, get into bed. I'll be in
in a minute to tuck you in.

27:12.775 --> 27:14.693
- But, Mom...
- Right now.

27:20.282 --> 27:22.159
Why are you treating Andy like this?

27:22.243 --> 27:25.746
If he says he doesn't know how those
footprints got there, then he doesn't.

27:25.830 --> 27:28.878
Look, Mrs. Barclay, somebody made those
footprints. If not Andy, then who?

27:28.958 --> 27:30.921
I don't know, and I don't care.

27:31.001 --> 27:33.841
All I know is that I've just lost my best
friend tonight to a horrible accident

27:33.921 --> 27:35.423
and I would like some time alone with my son,

27:35.506 --> 27:37.595
who I'm sure is just as upset
about this as I am.

27:37.675 --> 27:40.344
Okay. Sorry. I'm sorry.

27:40.428 --> 27:43.559
I'll clear everybody out of here
right away. Okay?

27:43.639 --> 27:46.517
Hey, guys, you done? Let's go. Chop-chop.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.689
Let's go, everybody. Out of here.

27:48.769 --> 27:50.566
Let's clear this up over here. Come on.

27:50.646 --> 27:51.814
Okay.

27:51.897 --> 27:53.566
Let's go, Sid.

27:59.029 --> 28:03.993
What do you think was so important
about my sneakers, Chucky?

28:04.827 --> 28:07.371
You don't know either, do you?

28:28.142 --> 28:30.561
Well, let me know if you find out
anything about those footprints.

28:30.644 --> 28:32.146
Mommy, Mommy.

28:32.229 --> 28:34.819
Mommy, I know who was
on the kitchen counter. I know, I know.

28:34.899 --> 28:37.113
- Andy, I thought I...
- Who, Andy? Who?

28:37.193 --> 28:38.444
Chucky!

28:38.986 --> 28:40.321
Your doll?

28:41.322 --> 28:42.618
Andy, that's enough stories for tonight.

28:42.698 --> 28:45.579
Now, come on, back to bed. Now I mean it.

28:45.659 --> 28:47.036
But, Mom...

28:51.332 --> 28:53.209
Good night, Detective.

28:56.504 --> 28:58.092
- What?
- Are you gonna call me?

28:58.172 --> 29:02.138
- You don't give up, do you?
- I just... I hate loose ends.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.878
And I hate people
who don't know when to stop.

29:06.013 --> 29:07.056
Ouch.

29:07.139 --> 29:09.812
- A spirited lady.
- No kidding.

29:09.892 --> 29:11.519
I want that autopsy report on my desk

29:11.602 --> 29:12.940
- first thing tomorrow.
- Yeah.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.731
And anything you can find out
about Mrs. Barclay and her son.

29:15.815 --> 29:18.487
You got it.
Anything else I can do for you, sir?

29:18.567 --> 29:22.324
Oh, yeah. Here. Get this to the lab.

29:22.404 --> 29:23.989
I found it in the corner of the kitchen.

29:24.073 --> 29:26.534
- What is this?
- Possible murder weapon.

29:26.617 --> 29:27.618
No.

29:28.702 --> 29:30.830
Come on. You're kidding me.

29:32.540 --> 29:35.084
Hey, you are kidding me, aren't you?

29:39.880 --> 29:42.925
'Cause she saw you walking and talking?

29:55.396 --> 29:59.400
I guess there was no hiding from her.

30:03.571 --> 30:05.493
Andy, who are you talking to?

30:05.573 --> 30:06.782
Chucky.

30:18.669 --> 30:20.129
Chucky, huh?

30:20.296 --> 30:22.218
Yeah, sure, Chucky.

30:22.298 --> 30:24.592
He's sitting right over there.

30:28.012 --> 30:30.893
Chucky's been talking to you, too, hasn't he?

30:30.973 --> 30:34.772
- What's he been saying?
- All kinds of things.

30:34.852 --> 30:38.272
His real name is Charles Lee Ray,

30:38.355 --> 30:43.486
and he's been sent down from heaven
by Daddy to play with me.

30:48.115 --> 30:51.160
He has, has he? Anything else?

30:51.494 --> 30:55.251
Yes. He said Aunt Maggie was a real bitch

30:55.331 --> 30:57.374
and got what she deserved.

30:57.958 --> 31:01.337
Andy, how can you say something so horrible?

31:01.921 --> 31:04.093
I didn't say it. Chucky did.

31:04.173 --> 31:08.260
Andy, stop it. You know perfectly well
that you're making this up.

31:09.053 --> 31:15.226
- But I'm not. Chucky's alive. Really, he is.
- Andy, Chucky... Chucky's a doll.

31:15.768 --> 31:17.853
He's made of plastic and stuffing.

31:17.937 --> 31:19.480
Look at him. Look at him.

31:19.563 --> 31:21.527
Now, does he look like anything else to you?

31:21.607 --> 31:23.237
Don't, you'll hurt him.

31:23.317 --> 31:24.735
Andy, look!

31:25.694 --> 31:28.993
Now you don't really think
that Chucky is alive, do you?

31:29.073 --> 31:30.494
But he is.

31:30.574 --> 31:33.119
Andy, stop it. Please.

31:34.161 --> 31:38.916
It's 'cause of Aunt Maggie
you're yelling at me, isn't it?

31:41.836 --> 31:45.256
Yes. Yes, I guess it is.

31:45.673 --> 31:47.303
I'm sorry.

31:47.383 --> 31:50.177
I'll stop making up stories.

31:55.516 --> 31:57.017
Thanks, champ.

31:58.769 --> 32:00.816
Do you wanna sleep in with me tonight?

32:00.896 --> 32:02.898
No, it's all right.

32:03.274 --> 32:05.151
I've got Chucky.

32:08.863 --> 32:10.573
Come on, into bed.

32:15.953 --> 32:17.913
Good night, sweetheart.

32:19.957 --> 32:21.375
I love you.

32:27.381 --> 32:28.507
Good night.

32:38.017 --> 32:42.271
You're right, Chucky. She didn't believe me.

32:49.111 --> 32:51.113
Hi. I like to be hugged.

32:51.530 --> 32:55.451
Good. I'd love to hug you, too.

33:09.799 --> 33:11.008
Hey.

33:11.801 --> 33:14.015
You sure you're all right about last night?

33:14.095 --> 33:16.472
No bad dreams about Aunt Maggie?

33:17.098 --> 33:19.475
And Chucky's only a doll, right?

33:21.435 --> 33:24.313
All right, off to school with you, then.
I love you tons.

34:39.847 --> 34:42.891
<i>43rd street. Next stop, 47th.</i>

35:35.194 --> 35:36.821
Is that Eddie's?

35:41.075 --> 35:45.121
Look, you stay here. I have to go tinkle.

35:56.424 --> 35:58.592
I'll be right there, Chucky.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.002
Chucky?

37:15.920 --> 37:17.171
Chucky?

38:09.640 --> 38:10.850
Chucky?

38:17.148 --> 38:18.441
Chucky?

38:19.525 --> 38:20.734
Chucky?

38:21.861 --> 38:23.028
Chucky?

38:37.042 --> 38:38.252
Chucky?

38:42.548 --> 38:43.966
Chucky?

39:07.782 --> 39:08.991
Mrs. Barclay.

39:09.074 --> 39:11.956
Detective Norris,
I came as soon as I got your message.

39:12.036 --> 39:13.541
You haven't been to the school
to pick up your son yet?

39:13.621 --> 39:17.625
- No. No, I came directly from work. Why?
- Let's go into my office.

39:19.168 --> 39:21.837
- Is something wrong with Andy?
- Please.

39:24.340 --> 39:25.424
I...

39:29.678 --> 39:31.767
I don't know how to tell you this,
Mrs. Barclay.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.307
Tell me what?

39:33.390 --> 39:36.772
Do you have any idea why
your Aunt Maggie fell out of that window?

39:36.852 --> 39:39.021
- Yes.
- Could you tell me why?

39:40.606 --> 39:45.489
'Cause she saw Chucky,
and it scared her so much, she fell out.

39:45.569 --> 39:47.196
Oh, she did, huh?

39:47.655 --> 39:50.619
So why did Chucky go to see Eddie Caputo?

39:50.699 --> 39:51.954
Mommy!

39:52.034 --> 39:53.661
Oh, Andy.

39:57.623 --> 39:59.917
All right, sweetheart. Come on.

40:02.169 --> 40:04.088
Now listen to me, okay?

40:05.339 --> 40:07.800
Nobody believes you about Chucky.

40:08.801 --> 40:11.720
Unless you start telling the truth right now,

40:13.180 --> 40:15.891
they're going to take you away from me.

40:18.477 --> 40:20.107
You hear that, Chucky?

40:20.187 --> 40:23.315
They're taking me away
unless you say something.

40:26.068 --> 40:27.987
Please, say something.

40:29.572 --> 40:32.328
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

40:32.408 --> 40:35.953
Tell me why you lied to me about everything.

40:36.036 --> 40:39.248
Come on, Chucky. Say something.

40:39.582 --> 40:41.167
Tell me.

40:41.250 --> 40:45.596
Hi, I'm Chucky, and I'm your friend
to the end. Hidey-ho.

40:48.257 --> 40:51.051
Mommy, he's doing it on purpose.

40:51.135 --> 40:55.518
He told me never to tell about him
or he'd kill me.

40:55.598 --> 40:59.351
<i>Mrs. Barclay, my name is Dr. Ardmore.
I'm from County General.</i>

40:59.518 --> 41:01.604
<i>I've seen more than enough.</i>

41:01.896 --> 41:05.065
Maybe Andy should spend
a couple of days with us.

41:42.603 --> 41:47.024
Well, say something, you little bastard.

41:48.901 --> 41:50.778
Say something, damn it!

41:51.987 --> 41:54.156
Hi. I like to be hugged.

42:35.990 --> 42:38.367
"He wants you for a best friend."

42:38.659 --> 42:40.077
Yeah, sure.

43:39.386 --> 43:41.833
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?

44:45.119 --> 44:46.495
Talk to me.

44:47.913 --> 44:49.457
Come on, talk.

44:51.250 --> 44:53.878
I said, talk to me, damn it. All right.

44:54.545 --> 44:56.714
Then I'm gonna make you talk!

45:09.477 --> 45:13.189
I said talk to me, damn it,
or else I am gonna throw you in the fire!

45:13.272 --> 45:15.945
You stupid bitch! You filthy slut!

45:16.025 --> 45:19.361
- I'll teach you to fuck with me!
- No! No!

45:57.691 --> 45:58.776
Stop!

46:32.893 --> 46:33.894
No.

46:36.439 --> 46:37.440
No.

46:40.901 --> 46:41.944
No!

46:51.912 --> 46:53.831
Detective Norris!

46:53.914 --> 46:55.586
Mrs. Barclay, what are you doing back here?

46:55.666 --> 46:59.670
Andy was telling the truth.
Chucky is alive and he killed Eddie Caputo.

46:59.754 --> 47:01.714
- What?
- I took him home to my apartment.

47:01.797 --> 47:05.680
I was about to throw away the box that
he came in when the batteries fell out.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.847
Don't you see?

47:06.927 --> 47:10.226
He's been moving and talking for days
without any batteries in him.

47:10.306 --> 47:13.350
- What are you talking about?
- How I found out the doll was alive.

47:13.434 --> 47:15.773
See, I threatened
to throw him into the fireplace,

47:15.853 --> 47:18.442
when all of a sudden,
he came alive in my hand.

47:18.522 --> 47:21.609
I dropped him, and he got up
and ran out of the apartment.

47:22.401 --> 47:24.073
Good night, Mrs. Barclay.

47:24.153 --> 47:27.239
Wait a minute. I am telling you the truth.

47:27.323 --> 47:30.493
- He killed Maggie. He killed Eddie Caputo.
- Look, Mrs. Barclay.

47:30.576 --> 47:32.415
I sympathize with you. I really do.

47:32.495 --> 47:34.330
I hated what happened in there today.

47:34.413 --> 47:38.334
- But lying is not gonna help your son.
- Lying? Does this look like I'm lying?

47:40.169 --> 47:42.425
- How did you get those?
- Chucky bit me.

47:42.505 --> 47:45.261
Oh, for God's sake.

47:45.341 --> 47:47.510
All right, don't believe me.

47:48.969 --> 47:51.430
- Where you going?
- To find Chucky.

47:51.514 --> 47:52.727
How you gonna do that?

47:52.807 --> 47:55.146
I bought him from a peddler where I work.
I'll start there.

47:55.226 --> 47:57.770
That isn't a good part of town
to be in at this time of night.

47:58.187 --> 47:59.730
Mrs. Barclay, do you hear me?

47:59.814 --> 48:02.733
You don't want to go down there
at this time of night.

48:07.363 --> 48:09.198
God damn it.

49:24.190 --> 49:26.066
What's she doing here?

49:30.070 --> 49:32.156
Hey, excuse me.

49:32.239 --> 49:33.407
Mister.

49:36.202 --> 49:37.453
Mister.

49:37.578 --> 49:40.289
I'm not gonna hurt you. Do you remember me?

49:40.372 --> 49:42.545
- No, no.
- I'm sorry. I bought a doll from you

49:42.625 --> 49:44.794
in back of Carson's department store
with my friend yesterday.

49:44.877 --> 49:46.754
- Doll?
- Yes, a Good Guy doll.

49:46.837 --> 49:50.466
- You sold it to me. Do you remember?
- Oh, yeah, a doll. What about it?

49:50.549 --> 49:54.348
- Where did you get it?
- What will you give me if I tell you?

49:54.428 --> 49:59.308
I don't have much,
but you're welcome to whatever I have.

50:01.936 --> 50:04.438
It's not enough. What else you got?

50:05.356 --> 50:07.817
- That's all I've got.
- All you got?

50:08.109 --> 50:11.028
- What are you... Yes.
- That's not all you got.

50:11.112 --> 50:12.533
- Wait a minute.
- No, you got a lot.

50:12.613 --> 50:14.782
No. No, no.

50:14.865 --> 50:17.952
No. Wait. No, no!

50:18.035 --> 50:19.078
Pig!

50:19.912 --> 50:23.165
- Christ, he's a cop!
- All right. What about the rest of you?

50:23.249 --> 50:25.000
You wanna party, too?

50:31.507 --> 50:33.968
All right. Now, you want to answer
the lady's question now?

50:34.051 --> 50:37.725
- Where did you get the doll from?
- I don't know nothing about no doll.

50:37.805 --> 50:39.557
You're not gonna know nothing
about nothing in a minute,

50:39.640 --> 50:41.016
unless you talk to me. Now talk!

50:41.100 --> 50:44.687
A burned-out toy store on Wabash.
That's where I got it.

50:46.856 --> 50:48.399
Get out of here.

50:50.484 --> 50:51.986
What's wrong?

50:53.404 --> 50:54.447
Nothing.

50:56.365 --> 50:58.909
Well, wait a minute. Something
the peddler said upset you. What was it?

50:58.993 --> 51:00.953
I just told you, nothing.

51:02.163 --> 51:05.458
God damn it. My son's life is at stake.
Now, what was it?

51:06.751 --> 51:10.713
The place where he said he got the doll,
Charles Lee Ray died there.

51:10.796 --> 51:11.922
Who?

51:12.006 --> 51:16.135
The Lake Shore Strangler. The man
who's partners with Eddie Caputo.

51:17.136 --> 51:19.638
- Hey. Where are you going now?
- Wabash and Van Buren.

51:19.722 --> 51:22.144
There's nothing there.
It's an abandoned wreck of a store.

51:22.224 --> 51:23.270
Why don't you believe me?

51:23.350 --> 51:26.645
It was struck by lightning
the night that Charles Lee Ray died.

51:28.689 --> 51:29.774
How do you know that?

51:29.857 --> 51:33.068
Because I was there.
I was the man who killed him.

51:39.742 --> 51:41.660
Why didn't you tell me?

51:42.536 --> 51:45.873
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you tell someone.

51:46.373 --> 51:49.627
Come on, let me take you home.
You need some sleep.

51:49.919 --> 51:51.462
Did he say anything? Anything at all?

51:51.545 --> 51:52.675
- Who?
- Charles Lee Ray.

51:52.755 --> 51:55.841
Yeah. He threatened
to kill me and Eddie Caputo.

52:09.480 --> 52:12.445
I'm sorry you couldn't find anything
to help Andy.

52:12.525 --> 52:14.110
I really am.

52:14.193 --> 52:17.613
But I did.
I found out that Chucky is Charles Lee Ray.

52:18.239 --> 52:21.367
The only thing I don't know
is how he got inside the doll.

52:22.868 --> 52:25.913
- Good night, Mrs. Barclay.
- Where did Charles Lee Ray live?

52:26.622 --> 52:29.003
Look, please,
will you just get out of the car?

52:29.083 --> 52:30.880
Hey, just tell me where he lived.

52:30.960 --> 52:34.088
Don't you understand?
Andy's life depends on it.

52:34.296 --> 52:36.927
930 Stoney Island, the south side.

52:37.007 --> 52:40.886
But I've already checked the place out.
There's nothing there. Now, good night.

52:41.137 --> 52:43.639
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

52:44.014 --> 52:46.103
- Home, to get some sleep.
- No, you can't do that.

52:46.183 --> 52:48.686
Don't you see? You just said it.

52:48.769 --> 52:51.147
Chucky killed Caputo. That leaves you.

52:51.230 --> 52:53.732
- That does it.
- Please listen to me.

52:58.070 --> 53:00.531
- Out.
- I am telling you the truth.

53:00.614 --> 53:01.657
Why won't you believe me?

53:01.740 --> 53:04.702
Because I'm sane, Mrs. Barclay.
Sane and rational.

53:06.829 --> 53:08.706
All right. All right.

53:08.789 --> 53:11.125
Do you remember what you said
the first night you met me in my apartment?

53:11.208 --> 53:13.002
- What about it?
- You said you didn't like loose ends.

53:13.085 --> 53:14.086
Well, I'm a loose end.

53:14.170 --> 53:16.964
You can't just let go what I said tonight
without checking it out.

53:17.089 --> 53:19.800
For the last time, Mrs. Barclay, good night.

54:17.566 --> 54:19.360
Good night, asshole.

55:15.916 --> 55:17.543
Jeez, look out!

56:08.010 --> 56:09.345
Hi, Mikey.

56:18.312 --> 56:21.440
Won't do you any good, Mikey.
You can't hurt me.

58:44.157 --> 58:45.325
Karen.

58:49.964 --> 58:52.066
What are you doing here?

58:53.509 --> 58:55.177
After I talked to you last night,

58:55.261 --> 58:58.764
I decided to go back to the station
and pull Ray's file.

58:59.140 --> 59:02.601
I learned a couple of things.
His nickname was Chucky,

59:04.103 --> 59:06.897
and he spent a lot of time with this man.

59:12.987 --> 59:16.115
Now, all we have to do is find him
before Chucky does.

59:24.999 --> 59:26.375
Hello, John.

59:28.502 --> 59:29.879
Over here.

59:30.921 --> 59:31.922
Hi.

59:32.882 --> 59:34.467
It's me. Chucky.

59:34.675 --> 59:38.471
What do you think? The grigri work?

59:40.139 --> 59:44.226
You know, when I came here learning
all that stuff about how to beat death,

59:44.351 --> 59:46.937
I thought maybe you were pulling my chain.

59:47.021 --> 59:49.231
But not now. Not now.

59:50.357 --> 59:52.735
- Only one problem.
- What?

59:53.944 --> 59:56.864
This. I didn't think anybody could hurt me.

59:57.364 --> 59:59.325
But last night, I got shot.

01:00:00.076 --> 01:00:02.244
You know something? It hurt.

01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:05.247
It hurt like a son of a bitch. It even bled.

01:00:05.706 --> 01:00:07.500
Now why's that, John?

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:10.169
- You're turning human.
- What?

01:00:11.504 --> 01:00:14.131
The more time you spend in that body,

01:00:15.424 --> 01:00:17.635
the more human you'll become.

01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:22.264
You mean I have to live out
the rest of my life in this body?

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:26.435
No fucking way.
You got me into this, you get me out.

01:00:28.145 --> 01:00:30.648
- I can't do that, Chucky.
- Why not?

01:00:31.565 --> 01:00:37.238
Because you're an abomination,
an outrage against nature.

01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:42.330
You perverted everything
I've taught you and used it for evil.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.245
And you have to be stopped.

01:00:48.082 --> 01:00:50.963
You know, I thought
something like this might happen.

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:54.296
- That's why I prepared for it.
- What are you talking about?

01:00:54.839 --> 01:00:56.966
Your own personal mojo, doc.

01:00:58.342 --> 01:01:01.720
- Give me that.
- Sure. How do you want it? Broken leg?

01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:09.353
Shouldn't tell your customers
where you hide things like this, John.

01:01:09.437 --> 01:01:11.814
Gets you in trouble every time.

01:01:11.897 --> 01:01:14.400
Now how do I get out of this body?

01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:17.194
- No, I won't tell you.
- Yeah?

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:23.701
Tell me or die, John. Your choice.

01:01:23.784 --> 01:01:25.953
No, I'll tell you.

01:01:28.372 --> 01:01:31.709
You have to transfer your soul
out of the doll

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:35.838
into that of the first human being
you revealed your true self to.

01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:40.634
You mean the first person I let in
on the fact that I was really alive?

01:01:43.012 --> 01:01:45.935
I don't believe it. I just don't believe it.

01:01:46.015 --> 01:01:50.147
The first person I let in on my little secret
was a six-year-old kid.

01:01:50.227 --> 01:01:52.646
I'm gonna be six years old again.

01:01:52.897 --> 01:01:56.525
Well, John, it's been fun, but I gotta go.

01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:59.779
I have a date with a six-year-old boy.

01:02:00.863 --> 01:02:03.824
And you have a date with death.

01:02:07.411 --> 01:02:09.205
So long, John.

01:02:34.313 --> 01:02:36.273
Hold it. Wait, wait.

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:45.408
Oh, my God.

01:02:48.911 --> 01:02:50.496
- Too late.
- What?

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.916
Must save the boy. Must...

01:02:56.877 --> 01:02:58.712
Must get his soul...

01:02:59.713 --> 01:03:02.550
into him like he got into doll.

01:03:02.925 --> 01:03:04.051
What?

01:03:04.718 --> 01:03:08.055
You must stop him
before he can say the chant.

01:03:08.764 --> 01:03:11.475
Kill him before he can say it.

01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:13.352
But how? How?

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:18.399
The heart. His heart is almost human.

01:03:20.901 --> 01:03:24.071
It's the only way. Through the heart.

01:03:42.047 --> 01:03:45.843
Help me! Help me! Dr. Ardmore, Chucky's here!

01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:00.483
Help me! He's coming to kill me!
He's here. Chucky's here.

01:04:00.566 --> 01:04:02.443
I don't see anybody.

01:04:04.028 --> 01:04:06.530
But, Doctor, Chucky's here,

01:04:06.614 --> 01:04:08.741
and he's going to kill me.

01:04:12.036 --> 01:04:16.207
But Chucky is here,
and he's going to kill me!

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:22.171
He's going to kill me.

01:04:22.254 --> 01:04:25.341
Please don't leave me. Please.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:19.353
No!

01:05:22.064 --> 01:05:25.192
- Andy, stop.
- Hey, wait a minute.

01:05:25.276 --> 01:05:26.569
Stop him!

01:05:39.623 --> 01:05:41.625
Check the north corridor.

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:29.673
Easy. Easy, it's all right, Andy.
It's all right.

01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:32.551
You're not gonna
need this anymore, all right?

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.764
But I do. Chucky's in the room,
and he's trying to kill me.

01:06:36.847 --> 01:06:39.266
No, Andy. It's gonna be all right.
I'm here now.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:41.060
And I'm gonna protect you.

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:44.146
Andy. Easy, boy. Easy.

01:06:44.605 --> 01:06:46.315
Come on, nobody's here.

01:06:46.398 --> 01:06:49.151
- No, please. He'll kill you, too.
- Andy, now...

01:06:49.235 --> 01:06:52.283
No, please. Listen to me. Please.

01:06:52.363 --> 01:06:55.783
Andy, now this is just gonna
sting you for one second.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.593
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:07:19.432 --> 01:07:20.474
Stop.

01:07:37.992 --> 01:07:39.160
What happened?

01:07:39.243 --> 01:07:41.499
Look, miss, could you just
excuse us for a minute here, all right?

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:42.705
What?

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:46.962
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:50.299
Fried him to a crisp with the electric
shock machine and then he escaped.

01:07:50.379 --> 01:07:52.006
Escaped? Where?

01:07:52.089 --> 01:07:55.301
We don't know, but I bet she does.

01:08:00.598 --> 01:08:03.017
Chucky. You seen Chucky anywhere?

01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:05.648
- Who's Chucky?
- Kid's doll.

01:08:05.728 --> 01:08:08.814
The same one that was at the station house.
Have you seen him anywhere?

01:08:08.898 --> 01:08:11.692
What am I gonna know about a doll?
Where are you going?

01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:16.363
They think Andy did it.

01:08:16.447 --> 01:08:19.828
I know, the girl said that Chucky was here,
and that he was looking for Andy.

01:08:19.908 --> 01:08:21.663
- But where would Andy go?
- He'd go home.

01:08:21.743 --> 01:08:23.370
I always told him to go there
if he was in trouble.

01:08:23.453 --> 01:08:25.334
- Does he have a key?
- It's under the mat.

01:08:25.413 --> 01:08:26.582
Come on. Come on. We don't have much time.

01:08:52.858 --> 01:08:54.026
Look, George.

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:57.154
- Some child left their doll in the elevator.
- Leave it alone.

01:08:57.238 --> 01:09:00.032
Whoever left it there
will come back looking for it.

01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:06.747
Ugly doll.

01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:10.000
Fuck you.

01:10:54.355 --> 01:10:55.648
Surprise!

01:11:27.096 --> 01:11:28.225
Batter up!

01:12:12.349 --> 01:12:15.060
Give me the power, I beg of you.

01:12:32.828 --> 01:12:33.954
Andy!

01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:40.131
Andy!

01:12:40.211 --> 01:12:41.924
- Andy!
- Andy!

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.798
Andy, can you hear me?

01:12:50.137 --> 01:12:51.097
Andy!

01:12:52.348 --> 01:12:53.474
Andy!

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:02.399
Andy.

01:13:02.942 --> 01:13:05.444
Karen, Karen, are you all right?

01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:10.449
Oh, Mike.

01:13:10.574 --> 01:13:12.535
Just take care of Andy.

01:13:16.705 --> 01:13:18.165
Karen, Karen.

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:20.918
- Take this. Take it.
- Mike!

01:13:23.504 --> 01:13:24.755
Mommy.

01:14:24.857 --> 01:14:26.984
What's wrong? Gun jammed?

01:15:05.564 --> 01:15:06.690
Andy!

01:15:06.774 --> 01:15:09.151
Andy, help me. The matches.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:11.153
Andy!

01:15:11.237 --> 01:15:12.655
Please! Now!

01:15:24.583 --> 01:15:26.460
Andy, no, please.

01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:30.131
We're friends to the end. Remember?

01:15:30.548 --> 01:15:33.676
This is the end, friend.

01:16:18.345 --> 01:16:19.722
Oh, my baby.

01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:21.599
Karen? Andy?

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:23.684
You all right?

01:16:31.025 --> 01:16:34.695
Andy, go get me the first-aid kit
under the kitchen sink really fast. Okay?

01:16:34.779 --> 01:16:38.282
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Chucky's dead.

01:16:50.836 --> 01:16:53.339
Mommy, Chucky's gone.

01:16:54.548 --> 01:16:56.258
Andy, hurry up.

01:16:57.635 --> 01:16:58.761
Andy.

01:17:13.109 --> 01:17:14.568
Hello, Andy.

01:17:17.238 --> 01:17:18.406
Mommy.

01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.908
Mommy.

01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:23.661
Mommy!

01:17:27.665 --> 01:17:32.294
Give me the boy, and I'll let you live.
Do you hear me? Give me the boy.

01:17:56.026 --> 01:17:57.236
Mommy!

01:18:30.019 --> 01:18:32.021
Give me the boy.

01:19:41.674 --> 01:19:43.012
What the hell's going on here?

01:19:43.092 --> 01:19:45.886
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
- Karen.

01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:55.396
Oh, Jesus.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.277
Yeah, I got a cop down here.
Multiple stab wounds.

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:04.113
The Brewster Apartments
on North Grand Street. Make it fast.

01:20:05.072 --> 01:20:07.616
All right, they're gonna be here in
10 minutes. Now, tell me what happened.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.202
The kid was right. The doll's alive.

01:20:10.619 --> 01:20:14.582
- He almost got the three of us.
- Come on, what are you talking about?

01:20:14.915 --> 01:20:18.335
You don't believe me? All right,
well, go on. Check it out in the hall.

01:20:18.419 --> 01:20:22.465
It's scattered all over the place.
But don't touch it. Do you understand me?

01:20:22.548 --> 01:20:25.843
- Don't you touch one part of it!
- All right, look. Take it easy, okay?

01:20:25.926 --> 01:20:28.471
Just relax yourself, all right? All right.

01:21:06.926 --> 01:21:09.553
Okay, Mike. I'd like you to take a look
at this thing, okay?

01:21:09.637 --> 01:21:12.098
Because there's no way this thing's alive.

01:21:13.641 --> 01:21:16.811
- I thought I told you not to touch it.
- Mike, will you be sensible?

01:21:16.894 --> 01:21:19.146
Come on, look.
It's as dead as they come. It's dead.

01:21:21.065 --> 01:21:23.192
Choke him! Kill him!

01:21:23.275 --> 01:21:25.820
I'll rip his throat out.

01:21:25.903 --> 01:21:26.904
Kill him!

01:21:30.491 --> 01:21:31.784
Kill him.

01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:40.793
Kill him now! Strangle him! Don't let go!

01:21:46.132 --> 01:21:47.216
God.

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:58.602
Kill them! Kill them! Kill them all!

01:21:58.894 --> 01:22:01.397
The heart. Shoot him in the heart.

01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:28.632
Hi, I'm Chucky.

01:22:29.008 --> 01:22:33.471
Wanna play?

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:45.524
- You believe me now?
- Yeah.

01:22:48.402 --> 01:22:50.759
But who's gonna believe me?

01:22:55.618 --> 01:22:56.869
Come on.

01:22:58.871 --> 01:23:01.165
All right. Ready? Here we go.

01:23:07.046 --> 01:23:08.297
Come on.

01:23:21.519 --> 01:23:22.686
Andy.

01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:26.107
Come on.
We're gonna go to the hospital with Mike.

01:23:26.315 --> 01:23:27.608
Let's go.
