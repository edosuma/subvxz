00:11.220 --> 00:14.681
Could you draw a picture
of where you last saw Doyoon?

00:50.968 --> 00:55.639
DR. BRAIN

01:17.452 --> 01:18.704
Heejin.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.040
Do you know who this woman is?

01:23.959 --> 01:26.879
Where is this? Have you been there?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.968
Sir, Heejin needs to rest.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.219
One moment, please.

01:36.054 --> 01:41.602
Heejin, can I take this drawing with me?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.439
Thank you very much.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.906
I am certain that my son is alive.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.702
And this drawing is proof?
Are you absolutely certain?

01:59.119 --> 02:01.205
The fire happened this summer.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.374
This drawing has
fallen leaves on the ground.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.294
It could be last autumn.

02:08.377 --> 02:10.088
They only met a few months ago.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.051
She could have drawn something
from her imagination,

02:14.718 --> 02:16.970
or it could be that she misunderstood
what she saw.

02:17.054 --> 02:20.974
No, Heejin drew exactly what she saw.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.060
She has a very rare gift.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.646
She has a photographic memory,

02:25.729 --> 02:28.440
meaning she has the ability
to remember

02:28.524 --> 02:30.776
and recreate things
she has seen perfectly.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.902
Dr. Koh,

02:33.153 --> 02:36.907
I'm very grateful
that you helped us find Heejin.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.203
I also want to apologize
for treating you as a suspect, but--

02:41.286 --> 02:42.496
You have to reopen my son's case.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.374
The police recovered Doyoon's body
at the scene,

02:45.457 --> 02:47.543
and you even held a funeral for him.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.711
We can't reopen
a missing person's case

02:49.795 --> 02:50.838
when the person is dead.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.091
But the brain sync that I did to find
Heejin wasn't authorized either.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.219
I'm not going to continue
breaking protocol like this.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.598
Never mind.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.935
If you want to find your son,

03:06.937 --> 03:08.981
you need to consider
your own safety.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.108
We need to go after
the real suspects.

03:11.942 --> 03:13.443
Please don't do this on your own.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.573
Come on.
I'll take you home.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.170
You see that car?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.462
Those are my colleagues,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.339
and they were put there
for your protection.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.633
You mean to keep an eye on me.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.843
That's right.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.929
Regardless of what I think of you,

03:41.388 --> 03:44.433
officially,
you're still the primary suspect

03:44.516 --> 03:46.143
in Junki Lim's murder.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.187
I hope you understand.

03:53.150 --> 03:56.445
Hey, can you please help me
find Dr. Hong?

03:57.362 --> 04:00.949
The day you saw me at the mall
I was supposed to meet up with him.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.368
I'm not exactly sure how,

04:04.119 --> 04:06.330
but it's possible
that Dr. Hong is involved.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.831
If that's the case,

04:08.498 --> 04:12.586
he could have some information
about the guy that got away.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.047
But I haven't been able to reach him.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.507
OK. I'll look into it.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.550
Thanks.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.315
This is very disappointing.

04:34.316 --> 04:35.817
The girl's alive,

04:35.901 --> 04:38.570
and Dr. Koh continues
to cause problems.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.868
The most infuriating thing, though

04:52.209 --> 04:54.920
is that Dr. Hong
is nowhere to be found.

04:56.255 --> 05:00.801
I get it. There's a lot to do.
I'll take care of it right away.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.572
One person came in,
and the three left together?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.323
Yes, they came separately
but left together.

05:23.407 --> 05:27.369
-Around what time was that?
-Around 10:20 p.m., I think.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.745
Thank you.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.379
Maybe those guys took the elevator
instead of the escalator,

05:37.921 --> 05:40.257
because they were heading
to the parking lot in the basement.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.219
Or maybe they just didn't want
to be seen.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.096
So, check this out.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.474
This is the last time
the suspect was caught on camera.

05:50.309 --> 05:53.145
If he came in a car,
wouldn't he have left in it?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.731
He must have known
where the cameras were.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.192
So he stuck to the alleyways
and sidewalks.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.363
He knew his way around.
Get any witness statements yet?

06:03.989 --> 06:05.991
Well, I checked with the employees.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.951
I'll check the license plates
in the parking lot as well.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.996
What do we do about Dr. Hong?

06:11.496 --> 06:13.790
-We still don't know where he is?
-No.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.085
You need to go to the BC Research Center

06:17.169 --> 06:18.754
and see if you can find out
anything more.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.631
Then send that footage out
for analysis.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.590
Hang on,

06:21.673 --> 06:23.592
do I look up the plates first
or do I go to the BC?

06:23.675 --> 06:24.676
Both.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.389
Jaeyi.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.434
Doyoon is alive.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.729
He's the boy in this drawing.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.186
I'm all over the place right now.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.857
I can't tell if I'm holding your hand

07:21.149 --> 07:23.694
because of my feelings for you or his.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.576
Is this how Junki felt?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.645
I'm so confused.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.609
How were you so sure
that Doyoon is still alive?

08:05.736 --> 08:08.238
I don't think your wife can answer
that question.

08:09.364 --> 08:13.243
You've been out of sorts lately.
That's very unlike you.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.790
I don't know how to find Doyoon.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.882
Every investigation hits
a point like this.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.220
You're backed into a corner,
and everything goes haywire.

08:33.096 --> 08:35.849
That's when you go back to basics
and start over.

08:36.725 --> 08:37.643
So,

08:38.309 --> 08:40.770
what information do we already have?

08:41.688 --> 08:45.359
Where was your son
the last time you saw him alive?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.402
Meaning I should go back
to the cabin?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.404
Got any other ideas?

08:52.366 --> 08:54.493
The cops are keeping watch
outside the house.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.288
Then I guess you can't do anything.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.042
You'll just have
to sit around and kill some time.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.685
-Someone's coming.
-Who?

09:20.686 --> 09:24.189
-I think it's the caregiver.
-Oh, yeah, it is.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.151
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

09:28.318 --> 09:32.406
The doctor asked me to give this to you
for all your hard work. Here you go!

09:32.489 --> 09:34.157
Thank you. You didn't have to.

09:34.491 --> 09:37.369
We've been feeling
so much safer thanks to you.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.453
-No, no.
-We're just doing our job.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.330
-We're just thankful.
-Appreciate it.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.374
-Here, have some oranges.
-We will. Thank you so much.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.042
Oh, thank you.

09:44.293 --> 09:46.170
-Hey, that's Dr. Koh. We have to go!
-Since you're staying,

09:46.253 --> 09:48.380
-Sorry, watch out!
-where are you having your meals?

09:48.463 --> 09:49.590
Hurry! Follow him!

10:08.358 --> 10:11.236
What? Did something happen
at Koh's place?

10:11.403 --> 10:12.654
He drove out of there so suddenly.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.072
We're following him now.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.659
Don't lose him. See what he does.

10:17.743 --> 10:21.246
Protect him if you have to.
Call me if anything changes.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.497
Copy that.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.131
Send that to me
as soon as you're done.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.050
And wire them
to all the other precincts.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.436
What's wrong with him?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.632
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell?

11:17.553 --> 11:19.096
Ah, shit.

11:21.431 --> 11:25.394
Dr. Hong hasn't called in
and hasn't been here the last two days.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.272
He's never done this before.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.065
He's not usually this irresponsible.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.443
We're all so worried about him.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.947
When's the last time you saw him?

11:39.408 --> 11:42.995
I think 9:00 p.m. on Monday.
when he was leaving work.

11:43.078 --> 11:46.790
Did you notice anything strange
or unusual?

11:49.626 --> 11:53.797
Well, it was like any other night.
We just said good night.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.513
Do you mind
if I look at his employee file?

12:01.597 --> 12:03.765
He must have an emergency contact
or something like that.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.517
I think his mother is the contact,

12:05.601 --> 12:08.061
but she hasn't seen him in a while.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.856
So, you've reached out to her?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.528
Yes, well,
we can't get ahold of him at all.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.780
I see what you mean.

12:42.137 --> 12:43.805
There's even a lake next to the cabin.

12:44.848 --> 12:45.682
Hmm?

12:47.601 --> 12:48.644
Oh.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.271
Actually, I can't go.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.363
Doyoon was really excited
you were going.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.491
So was I.

13:03.325 --> 13:07.037
The lab scheduled an approval review
for early next week.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.876
I don't understand.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.215
Why are you always working?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.884
Is that really your only priority?

13:23.595 --> 13:25.222
What can't you understand?

13:25.931 --> 13:28.308
You used to be consumed
by your own research as well.

13:28.392 --> 13:30.310
You're right. I really was.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.814
I still think about it sometimes,

13:35.566 --> 13:38.235
and I really do miss
that part of my life.

13:41.238 --> 13:47.327
But I made the choice to put it aside
for you and for Doyoon.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.498
Can't you do the same for us?

13:52.958 --> 13:55.419
Sacrificing work won't make me
a better father.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.088
I don't want you to sacrifice work.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.259
I just want to know
when we'll be a priority.

14:03.719 --> 14:04.887
Soon, I promise.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.181
But not now.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.395
You'll both have to go without me.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.508
Look, it's Doyoon!

14:43.800 --> 14:44.968
Hey!

15:08.242 --> 15:10.244
-Sorry we're late.
-It's okay.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.621
-You must be tired.
-I'm fine.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.623
Want me to give you a push?

16:01.211 --> 16:02.921
This place is beautiful.

16:05.841 --> 16:06.925
Thank you for inviting us.

16:07.384 --> 16:09.928
Thank you both for coming
all this way.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.313
I think Doyoon is so happy
now that Heejin is here.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.785
Mom and Dad are gone

16:33.952 --> 16:36.121
-Oh, thanks much!
-Oh, be careful.

16:36.205 --> 16:37.331
-I got it. I got it.
-Looks good!

16:37.414 --> 16:40.042
-You guys want snacks?
-Looks yummy!

16:44.129 --> 16:46.423
-Are you having fun?
-So good.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.509
-Are you happy Heejin is here?
-Yes.

16:52.763 --> 16:54.806
Is Dr. Koh OK with this?

16:56.308 --> 16:57.392
What do you mean?

16:57.768 --> 16:59.394
Well, with me and Heejin…

17:00.354 --> 17:02.439
being here with you.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.653
It's fine really.

17:09.112 --> 17:13.116
He's too preoccupied
to care about you guys being here.

17:14.034 --> 17:18.413
He also doesn't even know
how to be jealous.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.375
There are times

17:23.210 --> 17:26.713
I wonder if he's capable
of having emotions at all.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.302
I wish he would

17:34.388 --> 17:36.348
just once try to understand me

17:36.431 --> 17:38.225
or how I'm feeling.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.979
What did you see?

17:52.698 --> 17:53.740
Without me…

17:56.076 --> 17:58.662
they looked more like a family.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.755
It's that sort of insecurity

18:09.882 --> 18:11.592
that tears relationships apart.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.679
What am I doing here?

18:17.181 --> 18:18.724
The only thing I've learned

18:19.308 --> 18:21.560
is that I was a terrible husband,

18:23.145 --> 18:25.439
and that my wife was seeing someone else.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.944
None of this is going
to help me find Doyoon.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.370
I have no idea
what else I should be doing.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.706
Then stop trying so damn hard.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.127
And maybe wait for your eyes
to adjust to the darkness.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.327
Who is it?

20:03.453 --> 20:06.832
Hello, ma'am. I'm Namil's friend.
I came by because I was worried.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.625
What do you mean? Why?

20:08.709 --> 20:11.211
We were supposed
to have drinks last night,

20:11.587 --> 20:13.505
but he never showed up at the bar.

20:13.589 --> 20:17.134
Oh, is that so?
That's just terribly rude of him.

20:18.510 --> 20:22.389
Do you also work
at the research center?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.340
Ah, well, I'm so sorry,

20:56.507 --> 21:00.344
but Namil is visiting relatives
and won't be back for a while.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.138
But I'll let him know you stopped by.

21:03.597 --> 21:06.266
And I'll give him a piece of my mind
for breaking a promise like that.

21:17.653 --> 21:19.321
Where is your son, that bastard?

21:29.373 --> 21:31.500
STOP IMMEDIATELY.
LEAVE NO EVIDENCE AND RETURN.

24:56.914 --> 24:57.998
Mika.

25:04.588 --> 25:05.797
Mika?

25:09.259 --> 25:12.387
Oh, no! How did you get outside?

25:14.890 --> 25:15.974
Mika?

25:56.473 --> 25:57.516
Mommy?

26:05.524 --> 26:06.650
Come here, Mika!

26:07.276 --> 26:09.194
Mika!

26:20.080 --> 26:20.998
Mika?

26:23.125 --> 26:25.377
Come back.
It's dangerous out here.

26:31.508 --> 26:33.135
Mika, where are you?

26:34.261 --> 26:35.262
Mika?

26:39.558 --> 26:40.559
What the hell is that?

26:40.976 --> 26:44.479
We have to give the cops
something to find.

27:04.291 --> 27:07.044
That's enough. Go get the car.

27:20.724 --> 27:21.850
Mika!

27:22.726 --> 27:25.437
Mika, what are you doing here?

27:27.189 --> 27:28.690
How did you get out?

27:35.822 --> 27:39.284
Imagine how sad Doyoon would be
if you disappeared.

27:53.006 --> 27:53.841
Doyoon.

27:54.007 --> 27:54.800
Doyoon!

27:56.218 --> 27:57.261
Doyoon!

27:57.344 --> 27:58.303
Doyoon!

28:05.102 --> 28:06.144
Doyoon.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.651
Doyoon!

28:14.319 --> 28:16.154
Doyoon!

28:18.657 --> 28:20.075
Doyoon!

28:46.101 --> 28:47.019
Let's go!

28:53.859 --> 28:55.110
It wasn't Doyoon.

28:56.945 --> 29:00.199
The child in that coffin
is not my son.

29:01.658 --> 29:05.746
He's alive,
and I can finally prove it.

29:06.455 --> 29:10.375
You were right. They drove a car
into the mall parking lot.

29:10.459 --> 29:12.753
Detective Nam is looking
for fingerprints.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.922
-He'll tell me if he finds anything.
-And Dr. Hong?

29:15.005 --> 29:18.133
I found some websites
in his search history.

29:18.217 --> 29:23.055
He looked up rental cars, sea fare,
and train tickets. He's on the run.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.516
-Where did he log in from?
-Dobong-dong.

29:25.599 --> 29:28.143
His mom lives there,
so I'm heading over.

29:28.227 --> 29:30.562
I'll meet you there.
Send me the address.

29:30.646 --> 29:31.480
Yes, ma'am.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.232
DOYOON KOH, OUR BELOVED SON

31:14.750 --> 31:18.420
Hey! You trying to shoot
a horror movie?

31:20.339 --> 31:22.090
I'm taking a video for proof.

31:23.342 --> 31:24.301
Proof?

31:25.886 --> 31:27.179
Wait a minute…

31:28.597 --> 31:29.389
Dr. Koh.

31:39.191 --> 31:43.070
This video will also prove
that you desecrated a grave site.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.762
I don't think anyone is here.

32:14.101 --> 32:16.144
-You saw that?
-Someone's inside.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.662
Anyone home?

32:35.831 --> 32:38.917
Wait. That door's open.

32:57.477 --> 32:58.604
Anyone here?

33:01.481 --> 33:03.984
We can see you.
Can you open the door?

33:07.404 --> 33:08.488
Anyone there?

33:12.993 --> 33:13.994
Who is it?

33:17.831 --> 33:19.875
Are you Namil's mother?

33:20.542 --> 33:22.085
Yes, I am.

33:22.169 --> 33:25.589
Do you know where your son is?

33:25.672 --> 33:30.469
I haven't been able to get
in touch with him.

33:31.261 --> 33:34.556
We knocked several times.
I guess you were busy.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.600
Sorry, I just woke up.

33:37.893 --> 33:41.271
Are you OK? You don't look well.

33:41.355 --> 33:43.565
I don't feel well.

33:49.821 --> 33:54.159
Tell me, do you know
where your son could have gone?

33:54.910 --> 33:56.954
Or if there's a way to contact him?

33:57.579 --> 34:00.165
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.544
Just one more thing before we go.

34:05.254 --> 34:07.130
We're looking for someone.

34:09.925 --> 34:14.972
Can you tell us if you've seen this man?

34:16.139 --> 34:19.643
SAY NO.
WHEN I COUNT TO THREE, STEP ASIDE.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.148
I haven't seen him, no.

34:31.071 --> 34:31.864
One…

34:34.408 --> 34:35.409
Two…

34:37.244 --> 34:38.036
Three.

35:18.619 --> 35:23.415
I have Dr. Hong's location.
I'm on my way over there.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.835
I'll call you as soon as
I take care of him.

35:26.919 --> 35:28.420
TAXI
FREE

35:28.587 --> 35:29.630
Hello.

35:31.423 --> 35:32.633
Let's go to Hapcheon.

35:54.696 --> 35:55.447
Yes?

35:55.864 --> 35:58.617
He was torturing her
to get Dr. Hong's location.

35:59.618 --> 36:03.664
And he took one of her fingers.

36:04.414 --> 36:06.375
That psychotic son of a bitch.

36:06.959 --> 36:08.669
If they find out where he is,
Hong is dead.

36:08.752 --> 36:10.128
We have to find him first.

36:10.212 --> 36:13.841
Dr. Hong took his mother's card
and bought a train ticket.

36:14.299 --> 36:17.135
He arrived in Jinju two hours ago.

36:17.219 --> 36:19.888
He took a bus from Jinju station
to Hapcheon.

36:20.264 --> 36:23.433
Hapcheon?
What's he doing over there?

36:24.810 --> 36:27.896
Ask his mother what he might be
looking for in Hapcheon.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.607
I realize she's in a lot of pain,
but tell her that her son's in danger.

36:32.901 --> 36:33.777
Yes, ma'am.

36:34.236 --> 36:35.195
Wait.

36:40.492 --> 36:42.327
A HEALING JOURNEY
TONGINSA TEMPLE STAY

38:05.118 --> 38:05.953
What's that?

38:07.037 --> 38:08.372
What are you gonna do?

38:08.914 --> 38:11.333
To obtain DNA from a burnt body,

38:12.209 --> 38:14.545
I need to extract a sample
from deep in the bone.

39:04.303 --> 39:05.596
Dr. Koh's back.

39:10.726 --> 39:12.060
What's he doing?

39:13.645 --> 39:15.230
I think he's trying to be stealthy.

39:31.205 --> 39:32.080
You're right.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.796
-ALL GOOD WITH DR. SEWON KOH.
-OK.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.256
DR. KOH HOME SAFE.

39:56.813 --> 39:58.857
PROBABILITY OF PATERNITY
TEST RESULTS: NO MATCH

40:01.026 --> 40:02.027
I have regrets.

40:06.073 --> 40:07.658
I shouldn't have ignored you

40:09.535 --> 40:11.662
at Doyoon's funeral.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.667
Even if I wasn't able to grieve,

40:20.587 --> 40:23.006
I could have held you.

40:25.175 --> 40:26.552
But you were right,

40:28.762 --> 40:30.556
the child they found at the cabin,

40:34.309 --> 40:35.936
it was not our son.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.821
I wish that…

40:49.491 --> 40:51.326
I had believed you.

41:48.634 --> 41:51.094
I don't know who took Doyoon's place,

41:52.846 --> 41:54.806
or where the body came from.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.769
The DNA only says

42:01.063 --> 42:02.814
that this was not Doyoon.

42:07.569 --> 42:08.987
If it were you,

42:10.531 --> 42:12.449
you'd worry for the boy's parents.

42:14.743 --> 42:16.995
You'd say someone lost their child,
like us.

42:52.155 --> 42:53.282
What are you doing?

42:54.283 --> 42:58.161
That child had surgical scars on his head.

42:59.079 --> 43:01.957
It could have been brain cancer
or epilepsy.

43:02.541 --> 43:06.795
If I can figure out
what kind of surgery he had and why,

43:07.296 --> 43:09.089
I can figure out who he was.

43:12.634 --> 43:15.387
It's 78% likely that he was
somewhere on the autism spectrum.

43:17.097 --> 43:18.390
An abnormal brain.

43:20.559 --> 43:23.228
Doyoon could seriously benefit
from a program like this.

43:23.312 --> 43:24.813
Doyoon, let's go.

43:29.109 --> 43:29.943
I found him.

43:41.538 --> 43:42.414
Dr. Koh?

43:42.497 --> 43:45.000
I can prove that Doyoon is alive.

43:46.001 --> 43:47.085
What was that?

43:47.794 --> 43:48.629
Dr. Koh--

43:48.712 --> 43:50.172
I need to see you right away.

43:50.672 --> 43:55.302
I can't right now.
I'm down south looking for Dr. Hong.

43:55.636 --> 43:57.137
Do you know where he is?

43:57.596 --> 43:59.848
I'll let you know
as soon as I get back to Seoul.

44:00.599 --> 44:01.558
Hello? Hello?

44:13.237 --> 44:15.531
Hey! Now he's not even hiding it.

44:15.614 --> 44:18.158
-Dr. Koh. Dr. Koh.
-What?

44:18.242 --> 44:20.577
Dr. Koh!
Who else would I be talking about?

44:20.661 --> 44:21.703
Where's he off to?

44:33.465 --> 44:34.550
Wow.

44:35.634 --> 44:37.636
Shit, we lost him again. Damn it.

44:37.719 --> 44:40.264
What kind of doctor drives like that?

44:40.973 --> 44:42.975
He's like a racer. Damn it.

45:14.548 --> 45:16.550
I'm Doyoon Koh's father.

45:16.842 --> 45:18.051
One moment, please.

45:18.135 --> 45:20.179
I would like to speak
to his primary doctor.

45:20.554 --> 45:21.513
Yes, of course.

45:35.110 --> 45:38.155
DR. SOOJUNG HYUN, DIRECTOR,
CHILDREN / TEEN SPECIALIST COUNSELOR

45:45.078 --> 45:46.413
Excuse me, sir.

45:47.414 --> 45:50.626
If you'll please take a seat,
we'll assist you shortly.

45:51.543 --> 45:54.713
-Sanghee, could you help him?
-Please, follow me, sir.

45:59.510 --> 46:01.053
Please have a seat.

46:06.767 --> 46:10.229
Dr. Hyun, Doyoon Koh's father
is waiting for you.

46:34.169 --> 46:35.212
Heejin.

46:37.214 --> 46:38.507
What are you doing here?

46:39.049 --> 46:40.759
Doyoon was over there.

47:15.294 --> 47:17.421
OK, yes, ma'am.

47:45.657 --> 47:49.161
Excuse me.
Sir, you can't just walk in.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.205
Dr. Hyun, I'm sorry.

47:51.288 --> 47:52.831
He let himself in
while I was on the phone.

47:53.498 --> 47:55.459
It's all right. We'll be fine.

48:03.050 --> 48:04.259
Please, have a seat.

48:11.475 --> 48:13.018
I've always wanted to meet you,

48:13.101 --> 48:15.145
so thank you for coming here.

48:15.229 --> 48:17.981
Meet me? Why?

48:18.982 --> 48:21.777
Your book had quite an impact on me.

48:21.860 --> 48:24.196
I know that my son was here
receiving treatment.

48:24.655 --> 48:28.700
Obviously, I wanted to meet you
as Doyoon's father as well.

48:29.201 --> 48:33.247
I'd like to review
his medical records. May I?

48:34.414 --> 48:36.959
Of course. Just one minute.

48:44.758 --> 48:45.884
Doyoon…

48:46.218 --> 48:47.553
Doyoon…

48:50.848 --> 48:53.851
DR. KOH IS IN MY OFFICE

49:10.868 --> 49:12.452
DR. M: WHAT DOES HE WANT?

49:15.622 --> 49:20.127
Doyoon's file number is…

49:21.253 --> 49:22.838
REQUESTED DIAGNOSTIC RECORDS

49:44.610 --> 49:45.319
CALL ME

49:51.074 --> 49:52.159
No, this is unfortunate.

49:52.534 --> 49:54.912
I think his records
have been archived already.

49:54.995 --> 49:58.040
I'll go ask the manager.
I'll be right back.

50:22.606 --> 50:25.734
Yeah, he's in my office right now.
What should I do?

50:28.278 --> 50:29.613
I'll take care of it.

50:39.248 --> 50:40.832
DOYOON KOH: NO RECORD FOUND

50:50.092 --> 50:51.385
DOYOON KOH: NO RECORD FOUND
