00:02.503 --> 00:03.587
Previously on
<i>"The Girl From Plainville"...</i>

00:03.587 --> 00:04.713
- What do you think
dying is like?

00:04.713 --> 00:06.506
- Just like floating on water.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.717
- Your client sent those
text messages, Mr. Cataldo.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.761
It's all right there
in the indictment.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.346
A grand jury
<i>has indicted Michelle</i>

00:12.346 --> 00:13.805
<i>for involuntary manslaughter.</i>

00:13.805 --> 00:17.768
- Can you read that for me
out loud, please?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.562
- "Why don't you just
drink bleach?"

00:20.562 --> 00:22.564
- Natalie Gibson
and Cassie Wilkins

00:22.564 --> 00:24.149
on the witness list,
all relevant?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.275
- Yes, Your Honor.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.527
- The lawyer said
we can't talk to you.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.363
- We'd like you
to testify at trial.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.615
- What about Co?
He'll testify too?

00:31.615 --> 00:33.325
- Defense would
bring up the incident--

00:33.325 --> 00:35.536
<i>the assault on your son.</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:37.788
I just have
<i>all these issues</i>

00:37.788 --> 00:40.290
<i>with my body image.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:42.626
<i>I'm thinking I need</i>
<i>to go somewhere to get help.</i>

00:44.127 --> 00:45.963
<i>It's consuming my life.</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:24.626
Lynn, do you
believe Michelle Carter

01:24.626 --> 01:25.961
murdered your son?

01:27.462 --> 01:28.964
Lynn!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.761
What are your hopes
for the trial?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.555
Can you tell us anything?

01:37.723 --> 01:39.182
Jesus.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.187
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.323
"Hopes for the trial."

01:54.323 --> 01:56.283
Who asks something like that?

02:06.918 --> 02:09.338
- Hey, honey.
You okay?

02:14.760 --> 02:16.762
All rise.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.060
- Please sit.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.815
Um, before we begin,
is there any business

02:28.815 --> 02:31.693
either counsel would like to
handle before jury selection?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.280
- No, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.161
Your Honor, uh,
we would like to request

02:41.161 --> 02:43.413
a motion for a bench trial.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.666
You're sure, Counselor?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.042
Yes, Your Honor.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.627
- Miss Carter,
could you approach the stand?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.712
I'd like to hear this
for myself.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.283
Go ahead
and raise your right hand.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.119
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

03:22.119 --> 03:24.121
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.122
- I do.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.123
- You can lower your hand.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.666
Take a seat.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.714
Could you state
your full name and age?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.636
- Michelle Diana Carter, 20.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.179
- So you understand,
Miss Carter,

03:41.179 --> 03:43.890
that you're fully entitled
under the Constitution

03:43.890 --> 03:46.893
to a jury of your own peers
to decide whether or not,

03:46.893 --> 03:49.354
in fact,
you're guilty of this crime?

03:52.107 --> 03:53.483
- Yes.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.901
Has anyone
promised you anything

03:54.901 --> 03:56.111
or threatened you in any way

03:56.111 --> 03:58.780
to make you forgo your right
to a jury trial?

04:01.992 --> 04:03.827
- No, Your Honor. No.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.745
- Thank you.
You may step down.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.091
- The judge is now going
to exclusively decide the case.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.968
- What about the jury?

04:19.968 --> 04:22.471
- She just decided
there isn't one.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.724
The prospective
jurors are dismissed.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.893
The court thanks you
for your time.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.145
Unless there's any other
outstanding business

04:30.145 --> 04:31.646
to take care of?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.731
Okay.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.361
- How much does this affect
your opening statement?

04:38.361 --> 04:42.449
- Well, it starts with ladies
and gentlemen of the jury, so...

04:43.825 --> 04:46.161
- Did I do okay?

04:46.161 --> 04:48.330
- Yeah. Yeah, you did
just fine, Michelle.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.958
We will reconvene
here tomorrow at 9:00 a. m.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.643
- This is Conrad Henry Roy III.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.646
Conra--

05:27.786 --> 05:31.289
This is Conrad Henry Roy III...

05:33.416 --> 05:34.793
Reporting to you live

05:34.793 --> 05:36.962
right here
from Mattapoisett, Mass.

05:40.298 --> 05:42.551
I'm 5'10", 165 pounds,

05:42.551 --> 05:45.387
and I struggle with anxiety
almost all the time.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.636
You're set.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.597
Breakfast is served
at 8:00 a. m. sharp.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.015
After that,
you see your therapist,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.767
then you spend time outside--
monitored, of course.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.728
Lunch is at 1:00.
Dinner at 6:00.

06:34.728 --> 06:39.232
Lights out at 9:00.
Doors stay open always.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.152
You do your own laundry
and clean your own room.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.362
Your mother does not live here.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.947
Your phone.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.534
- Really?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.620
Yes, ma'am. Protocol.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.705
We give it to your parents
on visiting day.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.999
You get it back from them
when you go home.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.676
You've been restricting
and binging since 2011?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.973
No laxatives,
no purging, no diet pills.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.933
Excessive exercise?

07:19.230 --> 07:22.275
<i>Still taking the Celexa daily?</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:23.777
<i>No.</i>

07:23.777 --> 07:26.237
<i>What are you taking now?</i>

07:26.237 --> 07:27.906
<i>Nothing.</i>

07:41.002 --> 07:43.713
As each of you draw
how you see yourself,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.507
tell me how it makes you feel.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.114
<i>"He got scared,</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:11.700
<i>and I fucking told him</i>
<i>to get back in."</i>

08:11.700 --> 08:14.994
The defendant's own words,
Your Honor--

08:14.994 --> 08:18.832
17-year-old Michelle Carter,
who, for weeks,

08:18.832 --> 08:22.127
badgered and berated
her depressed boyfriend,

08:22.127 --> 08:24.879
Conrad Roy, 18 years old,

08:24.879 --> 08:27.215
into killing himself.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.676
Your Honor,
<i>this is not a homicide case.</i>

08:29.676 --> 08:32.429
This is a suicide case
on Mr. Roy's

08:32.429 --> 08:35.056
ultimately successful
second suicide attempt.

08:35.056 --> 08:38.184
When Conrad tried
to take his life the first time,

08:38.184 --> 08:42.605
he called a friend
and lived to see another day.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.525
When he tried to kill himself
the second time,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.360
he called the defendant,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.362
who ordered him
back in the truck

08:49.362 --> 08:53.908
and listened as he took
his last breath and died.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.702
- Conrad Roy's
internet searches will prove

08:55.702 --> 08:57.787
that he was suicidal,

08:57.787 --> 08:59.831
that he wanted to take
his own life,

08:59.831 --> 09:01.416
and that it was his choice.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.626
- She put him
in that car that night.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.755
- She was 30 miles away.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.507
- Her behavior
was wanton and reckless,

09:09.507 --> 09:13.094
and as a result,
Conrad Roy is dead.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.388
Now if somebody
wants to support

09:15.388 --> 09:17.098
an individual in a suicide,

09:17.098 --> 09:18.767
in the state of Massachusetts,
that's not a crime.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.727
Your Honor,
<i>by the end of this trial...</i>

09:20.727 --> 09:21.936
<i>We ask...</i>

09:21.936 --> 09:23.396

<i>That you find Michelle Carter</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:25.940
guilty of
involuntary manslaughter.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.693
- Not guilty
of involuntary manslaughter.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.528
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.912
- The Commonwealth
may call their first witness.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.919
- Stop.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.296
- It's nice.
We should do the photo.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.547
- On the count of three,
say Brady.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.425
- Smile.
- One, two, three.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.135
- Brady!
- Tommy boy!

09:54.135 --> 09:57.347
- Ha ha ha.
Let's get outta here.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.057
- Here, you can hold onto that?

09:59.057 --> 10:01.101
'Cause you'll never get one.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.605
- Uh--upp, upp, upp.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.233
So?

10:08.233 --> 10:12.153
- I was actually--
I was gonna hold off.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.324
- There's no time
like the present.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.034
Come on, it's your family.

10:22.247 --> 10:25.041
Everybody,
Coco has an announcement

10:25.041 --> 10:26.709
that he'd like to make.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.672
- Yeah, um...

10:33.133 --> 10:35.927
I got my
captain's license from NMI.

10:35.927 --> 10:36.970
Oh, jeez!

10:36.970 --> 10:39.264
Are you shitting me?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.099
Captain!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.059
- Did you know about this?
- Ha ha ha!

10:43.059 --> 10:44.394
- Of course not.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.994
Where'd he go?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.781
- Why didn't you tell me?

11:40.074 --> 11:43.786
- I'm didn't want to make a big
deal of it in case I failed.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.622
- When'd you find out?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.542
- Couple weeks ago.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.296
- Hey, I'm proud of you.

11:53.296 --> 11:55.632
I ain't been this proud
since we built

11:55.632 --> 11:57.759
this fucking thing, huh?

12:00.887 --> 12:03.348
- I guess I can retire now, huh?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.350
Leave the business
in good hands?

12:05.350 --> 12:07.894
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.854
- What?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.940
You don't know what?

12:11.940 --> 12:15.068
- I'm not sure I wanna live
in Mattapoisett my whole life.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.572
- What does that mean?

12:19.572 --> 12:22.450
- I don't know.
It's just...

12:22.450 --> 12:24.577
it's just an idea.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.621
Where you gonna go, Coco?

12:26.621 --> 12:28.456
What're you gonna do?
- I-I don't know, okay?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.417
I'm just--
I'm figuring it out, okay?

12:32.710 --> 12:33.711
- Okay.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.548
All right, come on,
let's get back inside.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.010
All these people
are here for you.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.846
Come on, it's embarrassing,
you sitting out here.

12:43.846 --> 12:44.847
Come on.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.324
Good morning.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.034
How you doin'?

13:05.034 --> 13:06.202
Morning.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.830
Please wait.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.214
- Let's go.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.509
Can you please lift your arms?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.390
Do you see Michelle Carter

13:27.390 --> 13:29.309
present in the courtroom today?

13:29.309 --> 13:31.019
- Yes.
- Could you point to her,

13:31.019 --> 13:32.979
identify something
that she's wearing?

13:36.691 --> 13:39.944
- I don't know, it looks like
a red shirt or something.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.195
- Your Honor,
may the record reflect

13:41.195 --> 13:44.032
identification of the defendant.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.367
On October 27, 2012,

13:46.367 --> 13:48.411
Conrad tried to kill himself

13:48.411 --> 13:50.538
by overdosing
on a bottle of medication.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.708
He was found in time
and treated.

13:53.708 --> 13:56.753
What was his demeanor like when
he was at Boston Children's?

13:58.421 --> 14:00.006
- He was scared.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.552
He said he would never
do anything like that again.

14:06.054 --> 14:09.557
He knew he had a lot
of family and support,

14:09.557 --> 14:12.643
friends, people who loved him.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.480
He was playing sports,
going to school.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.356
He even got accepted
to Fitchburg State

14:17.356 --> 14:18.566
on scholarship, right?

14:18.566 --> 14:21.694
- Yes, initially,
he was very excited.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.906
He went to visit his friend
Rob there to check it out.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.408
And that
would be June of 2014?

14:27.408 --> 14:30.286
- Yes, and he had just
gotten his captain's license.

14:31.412 --> 14:35.458
- I'm going to direct your
attention to July 12 of 2014.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.753
That was the last day
you saw your son alive.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.797
How was he that day?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.343
- We went to the beach.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.471
We stopped at Stop and Shop,
and...

14:48.471 --> 14:51.182
he was eating tortilla chips
and guacamole.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.521
My son had never
had guacamole before.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.982
He really liked it.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.692
And during that time,

15:01.692 --> 15:04.695
were you constantly
in Conrad's presence?

15:04.695 --> 15:05.863
Yes.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.826
What did you talk about?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.953
- Life,

15:11.953 --> 15:14.122
what was gonna happen next.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.292
We made some jokes
about some people on the beach

15:18.292 --> 15:19.836
wearing little swimsuits.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.132
He was fine.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.887
Yes, he had tried
to kill himself before,

15:29.887 --> 15:33.015
but I know my son,

15:33.015 --> 15:35.309
and he didn't want to die.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.062
Not that day.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.408
Today's your last day
with us, Michelle.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.618
We're all sad that
you're leaving so soon,

15:52.618 --> 15:55.538
but before you go,
can you tell us about

15:55.538 --> 15:57.832
the images on your vision board?

16:02.295 --> 16:06.257
- Every image helps me
to look to the future

16:06.257 --> 16:09.343
and not
to get stuck in the past.

16:10.761 --> 16:13.347
I really wanna go to California.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.060
Life seems different there.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.854
- That's great, Michelle,

16:19.854 --> 16:22.565
but make sure you're focusing
on what <i>you</i> can control.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.655
I can't control everything,
everyone,

16:29.655 --> 16:32.575
but...I'll be prepared.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.827
I know my triggers
and I'm gonna do better

16:34.827 --> 16:36.954
at continuing to identify them.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.383
I try to fix people
too much sometimes...

16:51.677 --> 16:53.888
Everyone, really.

16:56.474 --> 17:01.062
I have to remember to focus
on myself for a change.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.069
I found a stray.

17:10.655 --> 17:13.032
Welcome home, sweetie.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.578
- It's...it's only
been a couple weeks.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.082
We didn't know
what you'd want,

17:21.082 --> 17:22.959
so we made a bunch
of different things,

17:22.959 --> 17:24.961
but, you know,
we can always go out too.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.713
- Well, the doctor said
maybe it would be best

17:27.713 --> 17:29.131
to eat at home first,

17:29.131 --> 17:31.300
but we could go out if you want.

17:31.300 --> 17:35.346
- I'm okay, guys.
This looks really good, thanks.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.515
Great. Okay.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.937
- So what was it like there?

17:42.937 --> 17:46.440
- It wasn't that bad actually.
It was kinda like a vacation.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.568
- Did they throw you
in a padded room?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.986
- Hayden.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.862
- That's what they did
to Angelina Jolie.

17:51.862 --> 17:55.032
- Okay,
we need to get you out more.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.201
- It's okay.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.246
My therapist says talking
is healing.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.212
I like that movie.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
- Me too.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.092
Oh, now that you're home...

18:15.469 --> 18:17.096
You probably want this back.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.146
- So what else?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.659
I just got all your texts.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.577
You okay?

19:21.577 --> 19:23.621
- It's fine.
You just disappeared again.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.957
I'm getting used to it.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.086
- I got my phone taken away.
I was in the hospital.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.880
- For what?
You're not dying.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.924
- Can you be nice
for one second?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.928
I actually feel better.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.889
As my boyfriend,
you should be happy.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.225
- Sure, I'm happy.

19:45.768 --> 19:49.522
I got my captain's license,
not that you care.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.120
I'm sorry.

20:06.288 --> 20:07.998
I hate myself.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.501
- Don't say that.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.839
It's okay. I love you.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.643
I hate when you do that.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.146
You just type
and then erase things.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.317
Just talk to me.

20:38.904 --> 20:42.032
Or don't. Whatever.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.544
- I wish I could just
see myself

20:53.544 --> 20:55.963
as the person
I wanna be, you know?

20:57.298 --> 21:00.593
Not as this person
that's just always miserable.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.847
I know that I'm wanted.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.308
I know that I'm...

21:09.435 --> 21:10.770
Loved.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.649
I hate that I'm shy.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.569
I h-- I hate that I'm dumb.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.241
And I hate
that I'm always worrying

21:24.241 --> 21:26.035
and regretting about the past

21:26.035 --> 21:29.455
and I'm...I'm pessimistic
about the future.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.667
- You don't have to
feel that way.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.756
The hospital worked for me.
You could talk to someone.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.883
- Yeah, what's the point?

21:42.176 --> 21:44.261
I just feel like
I'm never going to be happy

21:44.261 --> 21:46.639
because I feel like
I'm a failure.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.100
And that--

21:50.100 --> 21:51.727
that's just
a minute's worth of ideas

21:51.727 --> 21:53.479
that pop through my head
on a regular basis.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.607
There's way, way more.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.785
Are you still there?

22:09.411 --> 22:11.664
- Yeah.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.959
It's just a lot to take in.
- I'm sorry.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.794
It's too much. I shouldn't--

22:16.794 --> 22:19.964
- No, I'm happy you did.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.319
- See ya, Kenny.

22:46.657 --> 22:47.908
Here you go.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
Where you going? It's 10:00 a. m.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.378
- Got plans.
- No, you don't.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.797
You did a shit job
cleaning those fuel oil tanks.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.173
I need you to do it again.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.676
Texted Bobby.
He said he'd cover me.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.261
He'll finish it up.

23:07.261 --> 23:08.804
- You texted Bobby,
so where the hell's Bobby?

23:08.804 --> 23:11.932
- I don't know.
Said he'd be here.

23:11.932 --> 23:15.102
- What, so that's it?
You're done here?

23:15.102 --> 23:17.229
- Sorry.
- Coco!

23:19.565 --> 23:21.191
Hey!

23:22.902 --> 23:24.194
Fuck.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.113

<i>And what did you do next, sir?</i>

23:26.113 --> 23:28.115
- I contacted
the District Attorney's office.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.619
Things were put in motion
to have the phone extracted.

23:31.619 --> 23:34.997
Then I interviewed Miss Carter
at King Philip's High School.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.041
- And then you got her phone
with the password,

23:37.041 --> 23:38.751
you spoke to her parents,

23:38.751 --> 23:40.461
and then you got her laptop,
correct?

23:40.461 --> 23:42.046
Yes.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.422
- Why?

23:43.422 --> 23:45.507
- The messages from
Michelle Carter to the victim

23:45.507 --> 23:47.384
encouraged him
to commit suicide.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.637
Once?

23:49.637 --> 23:52.473
- No, dozens of times.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.227
Thank you.
No further questions.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.820
- Mr. Gordon,

24:06.820 --> 24:08.739
did you find anything
of any substance

24:08.739 --> 24:10.866
on Conrad's laptop?

24:12.493 --> 24:15.496
- Yes, we found videos.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.040
- Can you explain what
those videos were about?

24:18.040 --> 24:20.918
- They were of Conrad,
three of 'em.

24:20.918 --> 24:26.131
He was alone making some sort
of video diary on his issues--

24:26.131 --> 24:28.008
social anxiety,

24:28.008 --> 24:31.095
lack of friends, his depression.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.348
He believed he wasn't
really normal, I guess,

24:34.348 --> 24:38.018
or like everybody else.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.146
Thank you. Your Honor,
no further questions.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.400
- You were
the officer that took

24:44.400 --> 24:46.443
the missing person's report,
correct?

24:46.443 --> 24:47.653
- I was.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.488
- Your Honor,
I would like to display

24:49.488 --> 24:53.325
on the court monitor
exhibit six, number five.

24:59.123 --> 25:02.084
Conrad's black F-250 truck.

25:02.084 --> 25:04.712
When you approached it,
what did you see?

25:04.712 --> 25:07.214
Well, the deceased
was wearing sunglasses.

25:07.214 --> 25:09.675
There's a general redness
to his skin,

25:09.675 --> 25:12.636
typical of
carbon monoxide poisoning.

25:12.636 --> 25:16.265
There was blood
from a supposed nosebleed.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.934
When do you estimate
the time of death for Conrad?

25:18.934 --> 25:20.436
The physical
evidence indicated

25:20.436 --> 25:21.979
that at the end
of the second call

25:21.979 --> 25:24.690
with Michelle Carter,
Roy was still alive.

25:42.958 --> 25:45.377
- Hey, I'm gonna head to bed.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.421
- Hey, are you okay?

25:50.758 --> 25:52.342
Okay, good night.

25:52.342 --> 25:53.802
- Night.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.060
- I wish she wouldn't
go to the trial.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.604
It's not good for her.
- Well, she's stubborn.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.524
Wonder where she gets that.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.526
- Co send you?

26:09.526 --> 26:11.695
- Everyone's worried about you.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.581
She looks skinnier
than I remember.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.168
- I can't
stop thinking about her.

26:27.086 --> 26:29.505
I don't wanna be
thinking about her.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.966
- You seen those videos
they're talking about?

26:32.966 --> 26:34.843
The ones Coco did?

26:34.843 --> 26:37.429
- I can never bring myself
to watch, you know?

26:39.306 --> 26:41.058
- You did good today.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.603
- I don't know what the hell
that even means.

26:49.691 --> 26:52.236
"48 Hours" wants to talk to me.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.737
- You gonna do it?

26:53.737 --> 26:57.449
- He's not just a dead kid
on the news, you know?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.326
He's Coco.

27:02.204 --> 27:05.207
I want people to know...

27:05.207 --> 27:08.502
to know him how we knew him
and who he was.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.843
Well,
that's the thing, isn't it?

27:15.843 --> 27:18.011
You don't know.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.513
I mean

27:19.513 --> 27:22.933
because sometimes people seem
like they're getting better,

27:22.933 --> 27:25.936
and they tell everyone around
them they're getting better.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.605
They seem happy.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.983
They seem good at home.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.280
They get
their captain's license.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.658
But you just can't know.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.958
- Yeah.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.507
- Ha ha ha.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.384
Did you see that shit?

27:57.384 --> 27:59.052
Did you see that headshot?

27:59.052 --> 28:00.429
Jesus Christ.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.681
Yeah, man,
I just sniped him!

28:02.681 --> 28:04.308
Yeah, dude, I just

28:04.308 --> 28:06.351
sniped him from like 100 yards.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.644
- Hey, hey!

28:07.644 --> 28:09.146
- I'm gonna try no-scope
this time.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.106
Fuck it.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.108
360.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.902
What the fuck, man?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.070
- This is why you come home
from work early, huh?

28:17.070 --> 28:18.780
Play fucking video games?

28:18.780 --> 28:19.948
- Yeah.
- You gotta be kidding me.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.366
Come on. Clean this shit up now!

28:21.366 --> 28:22.993
- Get the--back off!

28:22.993 --> 28:24.328
- Ugh--

28:24.328 --> 28:25.412
- Wait--wait--

29:20.175 --> 29:22.719
- Go get your stuff.
I'll see you at home.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.348
- It wasn't his fault.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.774
- God damn it.
- Lynn...

29:35.774 --> 29:38.986
I don't know what happened.
God damn it.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.904
God damn it, Co!

29:47.285 --> 29:49.371
- I know. I know.

30:05.095 --> 30:07.264
- Any comment?
- Lynn!

30:09.975 --> 30:11.727
- We can go.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.315
Would it be fair to say

30:17.315 --> 30:18.400
that you and Michelle Carter

30:18.400 --> 30:20.277
texted hundreds of times

30:20.277 --> 30:22.070
on a sort of day-to-day basis?

30:22.070 --> 30:23.947
- That sounds right, yeah.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.992
- April 23, 2014,

30:26.992 --> 30:28.577
10:05 a. m.

30:28.577 --> 30:31.872
Can you read the highlighted
section, please?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.751
- "Yeah, I have school friends

30:35.751 --> 30:37.669
"that all say they love me,
but that doesn't mean shit

30:37.669 --> 30:40.088
"when no one ever asks
to hang out with me.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.798
"No one ever calls me
or texts me.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.842
"It's always me
that has to do it.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.218
"I don't even remember
the last time

30:45.218 --> 30:48.346
someone asked me to hang out
with me before you did."

30:48.346 --> 30:49.765
Can you please describe

30:49.765 --> 30:51.308
your relationship
with Michelle Carter?

30:51.308 --> 30:53.727
- It was mostly
an in-school friendship,

30:53.727 --> 30:56.396
just, like,
talking in school and stuff.

30:56.396 --> 30:59.941
I didn't socialize with her
or anything.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.818
- How often
would Miss Carter ask

31:01.818 --> 31:04.488
to socialize with you
and Natalie outside of school?

31:05.739 --> 31:07.991
- Probably a few times a week.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.826
- During those years,
do you remember

31:09.826 --> 31:13.246
wanting to hang out with
Michelle outside of school?

31:13.246 --> 31:15.123
Um, no.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.917
"But I don't know
<i>what I was thinking.</i>

31:16.917 --> 31:19.544
"I knew I was just gonna make
it all come crashing down.

31:19.544 --> 31:20.962
"I always do.

31:20.962 --> 31:23.924
"I text them too much
or try talking to them too much

31:23.924 --> 31:26.802
"and they leave--
every single one.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.512
"Then I am left crying
in bed at night

31:28.512 --> 31:30.847
"because I have
no one, no friends,

31:30.847 --> 31:32.265
"barely any family.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.351
"Like, they don't even
like me half the time

31:34.351 --> 31:36.686
"and I have no plans, no future.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.147
I am nothing."

31:42.067 --> 31:45.904
July 10, 2014, 5:23 p. m.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.365
Can you read that message
from Michelle for us?

31:48.365 --> 31:50.033
- "Thank you so much
for coming over

31:50.033 --> 31:51.910
"and hanging out with me,
Cassie.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.745
"It really made me feel happy.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.497
"You and Natalie
are the only people

31:55.497 --> 31:57.040
"who actually make me forget

31:57.040 --> 31:59.167
"I have issues
and stuff for a while.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.503
"And, like,
you guys make me feel normal.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.463
"I can't thank you enough
for that.

32:03.463 --> 32:06.091
"I hope you want to hang
again sometime soon.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.510
I had a good time
and hope you did too."

32:08.510 --> 32:10.303
- And did you respond to that?

32:10.303 --> 32:13.390
- I don't believe I did, no.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.142
- "And I'll be honest--
I cried when you said

32:15.142 --> 32:17.561
"you wanted to help me
and hang out and stuff.

32:17.561 --> 32:21.690
It just meant so much to me,
like I finally found a friend."

32:22.357 --> 32:27.028
- Do you remember anything
about that particular sleepover

32:27.028 --> 32:30.740
on July 9th that might
stick out in your mind?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.534
No.

32:32.534 --> 32:35.370
- How did she seem,
if you can remember?

32:35.370 --> 32:36.955
- Fine.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.748
- Totally fine.

32:38.748 --> 32:40.542
- Do you remember the defendant

32:40.542 --> 32:42.961
using her cell phone
the night you slept over?

32:42.961 --> 32:44.880
- I don't remember.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.257
And when
you didn't respond,

32:47.257 --> 32:49.384
you received another
text message from Michelle.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.387
Do you mind reading that
for me, please?

32:52.387 --> 32:55.223
- "Conrad's missing.
They can't find him anywhere.

32:55.223 --> 32:56.975
"He's been missing
since Wednesday night

32:56.975 --> 32:58.727
"when you guys slept over.

32:58.727 --> 33:02.105
He hasn't called or talked
to me or anyone since."

33:02.105 --> 33:04.816
- "He's missing, like,
they don't know where he is."

33:07.319 --> 33:10.739
- July 12th, 9:24 p. m.

33:10.739 --> 33:14.868
Can you read that message
from Michelle Carter?

33:14.868 --> 33:17.329
- "He called me and I heard
like muffled sounds

33:17.329 --> 33:19.206
"and some type of motor running

33:19.206 --> 33:21.124
"and it was like that
for 20 minutes,

33:21.124 --> 33:22.834
and he wouldn't answer."

33:23.835 --> 33:25.879
"I think he killed himself."

33:28.215 --> 33:33.470
- Can you now read this text
from September 16, 2014,

33:33.470 --> 33:36.181
two months after Conrad's death?

33:39.434 --> 33:42.437
- "I fucking told him
to get back in."

33:46.191 --> 33:48.944
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

34:31.695 --> 34:35.198
- Thanks for meeting me.
- 'Course.

34:35.198 --> 34:37.367
He's just such a dick sometimes.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.994
I try to talk to him,
and it's, like...

34:40.287 --> 34:42.706
It's like we speak
different languages.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.044
- Maybe you should start
living your life

34:48.044 --> 34:50.714
for you, not for them.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.676
- What do you mean?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.885
- I don't know.

34:55.885 --> 34:58.888
Your Mom and Dad,
they're simple.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.851
I'm surprised
you haven't left already.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.644
You're above them.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.106
- Don't do that.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.651
- Do what?
- Don't talk shit

35:11.651 --> 35:13.028
about my family like that.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.904
You don't know them.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.950
- No, I wasn't.
I was agreeing with you.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.745
I was saying you deserve better.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.830
- You--

35:23.830 --> 35:25.457
You're just like everybody else.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.418
You just fucking...
you just talk.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.879
You just say shit that
you think I want to hear,

35:30.879 --> 35:34.174
but you don't actually listen
to anything I say.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.759
- Yeah, I do.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.637
I get you.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.722
- How?

35:40.722 --> 35:43.767
How could you possibly get me?
You don't even know me.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.063
- Okay, I'm...sorry.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.398
Just forget what I said. Ah.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.567
Let's start over.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.861
Come here.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.071
Come here.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.219
- I live in a different world.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.428
Okay?

36:22.180 --> 36:23.973
Not like you,
not like everybody else.

36:23.973 --> 36:27.102
So when you go to bed at night

36:27.102 --> 36:29.479
and you dream about

36:29.479 --> 36:32.440
puppies and rainbows,

36:32.440 --> 36:35.527
I dream about killing myself...

36:37.362 --> 36:40.407
Because that is the only way

36:40.407 --> 36:42.534
that my pain is gonna end, okay?

36:42.534 --> 36:44.494
I know that.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.708
So next time,
I'm not gonna screw up.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.836
Next time, I'll be dead...

36:52.836 --> 36:56.047
and then, maybe then,

36:56.047 --> 36:58.299
all of you

36:58.299 --> 37:01.720
will just fucking listen.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.183
- Maybe I should call your mom.

37:15.859 --> 37:20.280
- If you ever tell anyone
about me,

37:20.280 --> 37:26.119
I will never, ever
fucking talk to you again!

37:26.119 --> 37:27.746
You got it?

37:29.330 --> 37:32.709
Let's go, come on.
I'm taking you home.

37:32.709 --> 37:33.918
God.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.366
Hazel Grace,
<i>I hope you realize</i>

38:46.366 --> 38:48.660
<i>that you trying</i>
<i>to keep your distance from me</i>

38:48.660 --> 38:51.830
<i>in no way lessens</i>
<i>my affection for you.</i>

38:51.830 --> 38:54.499
<i>All your efforts to keep me</i>
<i>from you are gonna fail.</i>

38:56.167 --> 38:57.585
<i>Look...</i>

39:17.063 --> 39:19.524
Yo, you got me.
<i>Leave a message.</i>

39:19.524 --> 39:23.653
- Hey, your text freaked me out.

39:23.653 --> 39:25.655
I hope you're okay.

39:25.655 --> 39:27.448
Call me back.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.956
Yo, you got me.
<i>Leave a message.</i>

39:34.956 --> 39:37.166
- Hey, it's me again.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.210
Just text me back.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.909
Yo, you got me.
<i>Leave a message.</i>

40:58.456 --> 41:01.876

<i>This is Conrad Henry Roy III</i>

41:01.876 --> 41:05.129
reporting about social anxiety.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.633
Social anxiety, to me,

41:08.633 --> 41:11.719
is the inability
to function properly

41:11.719 --> 41:16.099
in a manner you want to
in a social situation.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.852
<i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that I realized is that</i>

41:19.852 --> 41:23.481
<i>not all eyes are on you</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

41:25.858 --> 41:30.154
Just gotta get
the cobwebs out.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.532
Turn the gears.

41:32.532 --> 41:36.786
The gears need to be turning.
Turn the gears.

41:36.786 --> 41:40.999
<i>That's what I gotta do,</i>
<i>because look at me.</i>

41:43.960 --> 41:47.338
<i>I got nice teeth.</i>

41:47.338 --> 41:49.424
<i>Got a nice smile.</i>

41:51.426 --> 41:52.844
It's pretty nice.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.517
<i>There's a lot of people</i>
<i>that love me.</i>

41:59.517 --> 42:02.145
I have a great mom.

42:02.145 --> 42:05.523
A great dad-- for the most part.

42:05.523 --> 42:08.109
Great parents.

42:08.109 --> 42:11.195
<i>I have all my grandparents,</i>

42:11.195 --> 42:14.657
<i>but I'm still depressed.</i>

42:16.242 --> 42:17.952
One of them
<i>is gonna pass away.</i>

42:17.952 --> 42:20.997
<i>I don't know when, but...</i>

42:20.997 --> 42:22.540
<i>when they do,</i>
<i>I'm gonna have to be there</i>

42:22.540 --> 42:25.251
for my parents,

42:25.251 --> 42:27.795
to be there for my mom and dad

42:27.795 --> 42:31.966
whenever their parents
pass away...

42:31.966 --> 42:35.261
<i>because I can't imagine</i>
<i>my parents passing away.</i>

42:37.472 --> 42:40.516
<i>How I'm gonna feel.</i>

42:40.516 --> 42:44.479
<i>The person that raised you</i>
<i>is not present.</i>

42:44.479 --> 42:47.857
<i>And this is what</i>
<i>I have to realize.</i>

42:47.857 --> 42:52.320
<i>Like, I am a lot better off</i>

42:52.320 --> 42:55.490
<i>than a lot of people.</i>
