19:38.002 --> 19:40.179
Any chance you can
give a gal a break?

19:40.222 --> 19:41.571
I could still make you a tooth.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.356
How hard could it be?

19:43.399 --> 19:46.663
-Actually, I just learned the
apartment's no longer available.

19:46.707 --> 19:47.925
-You just learned that?

19:47.969 --> 19:50.580
-Yeah. Just now.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.191
I'm gonna go.

19:56.282 --> 19:57.500
-I'd like the room, please.

19:57.544 --> 20:00.503
-Oh. [ Murmurs ]

20:00.547 --> 20:01.939
Just --

20:01.983 --> 20:04.812
[ Abby screams, objects crashing
and shattering ]

20:09.599 --> 20:11.253
-See you tomorrow.

20:18.478 --> 20:21.698
-I believe
we unleashed something.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.439
-What you mean, "we"?

20:23.483 --> 20:26.094
♪♪

20:26.137 --> 20:27.487
Sorry about
the apartment, Judge.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.359
-Mm. Me, too,
but it's totally fine.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.492
-Don't do it.

20:32.535 --> 20:35.277
-Okay, it's not totally fine.
It's bad.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
See? I'm getting better.
-And you're gonna tell Rand

20:37.279 --> 20:39.586
you want him
to move down here now?

20:39.629 --> 20:41.196
-Not quite ready for that yet,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.590
but I am feeling good
about finding a new place,

20:43.633 --> 20:46.636
and I may be willing
to play the game a little bit.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.857
-Perfect, because Sandy just
got a big batch of leads in.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.641
Now, I don't want to think
that he's responsible

20:51.685 --> 20:53.948
for these deaths,
but I honestly don't know.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.255
He's an interesting guy.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.169
-I think I'm gonna
try it my way.

20:58.213 --> 21:01.216
I'm gonna bring muffins
to the marriage license office.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.305
Like with me and Rand,
marriages often mean

21:03.349 --> 21:05.438
one person giving up
their old apartment,

21:05.481 --> 21:07.657
and I'd rather capitalize
on people's happiness

21:07.701 --> 21:08.919
than their misfortune.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.443
-Leave it to you
to take all the fun

21:10.486 --> 21:14.055
out of bending a corrupt system
to your will.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.318
-Alright, but you gonna have to
break the news to Sandy.
