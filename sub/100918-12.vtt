[Dr. McNider] I'm still

There has been a massive

22:48.000 --> 22:48.138
[Beth] What do you mean?

22:48.138 --> 22:49.840
[Dr. McNider] There was
an energy release
when Henry died.

22:49.874 --> 22:50.000
That energy was absorbed
by Brainwave.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
That energy was absorbed
by Brainwave.

22:52.000 --> 22:52.243
That energy was absorbed

They killed him.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.284
They killed him.

24:07.317 --> 24:08.000
And my mom.

And my mom.

24:09.487 --> 24:10.000
They sent Solomon Grundy

after them.

24:14.491 --> 24:15.894
And I think...

24:15.926 --> 24:16.000
that that's because
my dad found out exactly

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
that that's because
my dad found out exactly

24:18.000 --> 24:18.028

26:03.733 --> 26:04.000
I wonder, if I would have

26:06.000 --> 26:07.904
I wonder, if I would have

26:07.939 --> 26:08.000
maybe it would've picked me.

Uh, some sort of machine.

33:14.000 --> 33:14.798
Uh, some sort of machine.

33:14.832 --> 33:16.000
What machine?

33:16.000 --> 33:16.468
What machine?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.000
The equipment they stole,
the satellite codes...

33:18.000 --> 33:18.737
The equipment they stole,
the satellite codes...

33:18.769 --> 33:20.000
They must have used those
to build something.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.771
They must have used those
to build something.

33:21.806 --> 33:22.000
[Beth] Something big.

[Beth] Something big.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.478
[Beth] Something big.

33:26.510 --> 33:28.000
Chuck thinks they built
something he calls
a "synaptic amplifier."

33:28.000 --> 33:29.980
Chuck thinks they built
something he calls
a "synaptic amplifier."

33:30.013 --> 33:32.000
It's meant to transmit...

33:32.000 --> 33:32.715
It's meant to transmit...

33:32.750 --> 33:33.751
Brainwaves.

33:33.785 --> 33:34.000
So Henry's dad can reach
somebody else's mind?

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
So Henry's dad can reach
somebody else's mind?

33:36.000 --> 33:36.253
So Henry's dad can reach

33:36.287 --> 33:38.000
Millions of somebodies.

33:38.000 --> 33:38.555
Millions of somebodies.

33:38.588 --> 33:39.825
But why?

33:39.857 --> 33:40.000
Maybe those creepy guys
in the tunnel were
just a test run.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Maybe those creepy guys
in the tunnel were
just a test run.

33:42.000 --> 33:42.527
Maybe those creepy guys
in the tunnel were
just a test run.

33:42.559 --> 33:44.000
Right. And now
they're getting ready
for the big rollout.

33:44.000 --> 33:44.930
Right. And now
they're getting ready
for the big rollout.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.000
Are they gonna try to make
everyone else zombies or--

33:46.000 --> 33:46.798
Are they gonna try to make
everyone else zombies or--

33:46.798 --> 33:48.000
No. I don't think
that's their American Dream.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
No. I don't think
that's their American Dream.

33:50.000 --> 33:50.835
No. I don't think
that's their American Dream.

33:50.867 --> 33:52.000
Like Blue Valley, they wanna

33:52.000 --> 33:52.604
Like Blue Valley, they wanna

33:52.636 --> 33:54.000
have people follow their vision
and join them and...

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
have people follow their vision
and join them and...

33:56.000 --> 33:56.540
have people follow their vision
and join them and...

33:56.574 --> 33:58.000
I guess
follow without question.

33:58.000 --> 33:58.742
I guess
follow without question.

33:58.777 --> 34:00.000
Right, but not if we destroy
their machine.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.712
Right, but not if we destroy
their machine.

34:01.746 --> 34:02.000
Rick, is there a tunnel
that STRIPE could get through?

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Rick, is there a tunnel

The river. But don't think
I'm not coming with you.

34:10.188 --> 34:12.000

the opposite side of town.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.923
No. You, Yolanda and Justin
should enter from
the opposite side of town.

34:13.958 --> 34:14.000
You want us to split up?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.126
You want us to split up?

34:15.159 --> 34:16.000
Only to try to avoid detection.

34:16.000 --> 34:16.994
Only to try to avoid detection.

34:17.027 --> 34:18.000
But we'll meet back up
at the machine.

34:18.000 --> 34:18.697
But we'll meet back up
at the machine.

34:18.697 --> 34:20.000
[Beth] While you guys
go destroy the amplifier,

34:20.000 --> 34:20.532
[Beth] While you guys
go destroy the amplifier,

34:20.532 --> 34:22.000
Chuck and I can take down
