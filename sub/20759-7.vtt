09:09.174 --> 09:11.801
Please, everybody knows
I'm always saying "Patti" like that.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.011
Patti! Patti!

09:13.094 --> 09:14.429
Bladdy!

09:14.512 --> 09:16.723
<i>Foop! We're not doing this.</i>

09:16.806 --> 09:18.558
<i>It's time to go, girl.</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:20.560
<i>Move it.</i>

09:20.643 --> 09:22.145
Did that bladder just say "foop"?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.772
And that scarf and the face?

09:23.855 --> 09:25.607
And that thigh gap?

09:25.690 --> 09:29.486
[woman] <i>Is your overactive bladder</i>
<i>acting like a gay black diva?</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:31.571
Titus, it's you.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.031
But how?

09:33.114 --> 09:35.158
Before the cruise-- What cruise? Shut up!

09:35.241 --> 09:37.911
I did audition for a drug commercial.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.497
But I read for the part of "white doctor."

09:40.580 --> 09:42.123
[sighs] I nailed it, by the way.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.918
That must be how they heard your voice.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.544
Those bastards.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.380
Now I know
how Kimmy's kissing potato felt...

09:49.464 --> 09:51.216
used and thrown away.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.218
[sighs] I need to take a walk.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.636
-Oh.
-Titus.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.221
-Don't do it.
-No, please!

09:56.304 --> 09:57.388
[Lillian] You'll never make it.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.848
[cartoon bladder] <i>Don't listen to them!</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:00.225
<i>You best get going, bitch.</i>

10:00.308 --> 10:02.143
I will, but not because you said so.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.312
<i>Whatever. You're doing it.</i>

10:05.855 --> 10:07.065
[man on TV]
<i>Let's go to Drench...</i>

10:07.148 --> 10:08.817
[Lillian sighs]

10:08.900 --> 10:10.235
He's on his own.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.237
I've got a city to save.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.493
A bladder? Please.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.667
It's time to go, girl.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.460
Titus! I knew it.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.503
That's you, right?

10:28.586 --> 10:31.673
Ha! Man, those pee-pee commercials
are all up in my porns.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.299
You must be rich now!

10:33.383 --> 10:35.969
Wait. Should I be mugging you?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.972
Sir, if I were rich, do you think
I'd be talking to you right now?

10:39.055 --> 10:41.516
I'd be eating real mayonnaise
with a metal spoon.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.144
But Big Pharma just prints money, man.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.062
Yeah, they spend a lot on R&D,

10:46.146 --> 10:48.314
but once the drug gets approved
by the FDA,

10:48.398 --> 10:50.066
they got a 20-year patent.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.860
I know 'cause I'm also in the drug biz.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.111
Take a pen.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.866
Well, Big Pharma, I'm gonna make you wish

10:57.949 --> 11:00.368
you ripped off someone
with less time on their hands.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.752
I got your texts, Goodman.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.045
Thanks for coming.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.463
Care for a water?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.674
A handful of loose tuna?

11:15.425 --> 11:17.427
Please, sit.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.809
I have just one question.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.394
What is wrong with you?

11:26.477 --> 11:28.229
You're what's wrong with me.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.106
'Cause you're a traitor, Joe,

11:30.189 --> 11:32.984
who thinks that just because
he has real mayonnaise--

11:33.067 --> 11:35.528
No, no, no, no. I'm asking about you.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.781
What is wrong with <i>you</i> as a human being?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.159
'Cause this isn't really about me.

11:41.242 --> 11:44.996
You know I wasn't born
with a silver spoon in my mouth.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.623
Well, I was, but only because my mother

11:46.706 --> 11:49.542
wanted to smuggle the family spoon
out of Poland.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.587
I grew up poor, right here in the city.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.797
My father was a bricklayer.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.675
"Brick" was slang for a certain type
of wealthy, older woman.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.093
Yeah?

11:59.177 --> 12:03.890
My family was a living diorama
in the Tenement Museum.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.142
It's not a contest, Lillian.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.727
I'm saying we're the same.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.562
We fought for the same ideals.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.940
And then you sold out.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.651
No! I succeeded.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.653
And now I get to bring good jobs

12:16.736 --> 12:18.988
and great food to millions of Americans.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.324
Look, I'm one of the good guys.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.451
My employees get health care.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.996
Our food animals all get to meet
Michael Jordan before they die.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.791
-[scoffs]
-And your neighborhood is a dump.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.334
I can only make it better.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.922
My late husband is rolling over
in my wall right now.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.675
He loved East Dogmouth.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.551
And we were happy there.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.553
I'm sorry.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.224
My wife died five years ago.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.726
When did you lose your husband?

12:48.810 --> 12:50.395
September...

12:50.478 --> 12:51.980
1976.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.273
Forty years ago?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.901
Oh, my God! Get over it!

12:56.985 --> 12:58.611
People die!

12:58.695 --> 13:00.238
Allen Ginsberg is dead.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.031
Richard Pryor is dead.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.282
Bob Dylan is dead...

13:03.366 --> 13:04.200
to me.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.452
Can't show up and get a Nobel Prize?

13:06.536 --> 13:07.537
Rude.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.331
How could you be stuck in the '70s?

13:10.415 --> 13:13.126
Everything we fought for back then
was about change.

13:13.209 --> 13:17.922
Yeah, but then some of us realized
that change sucks eggs.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.757
There is such a thing as good change.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.050
It's called progress.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.844
Oh, what a crock.

13:22.927 --> 13:26.472
Ooh, jet packs, a decent Tupac hologram.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.767
And please don't get me started
on the Second Avenue Subway.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.728
It was just a lie

13:31.811 --> 13:35.231
told by <i>good guys</i> like you.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.027
Well, I guess
you've got it all figured out.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.820
And me...

13:41.779 --> 13:43.948
a guy with a monogrammed stapler,

13:44.032 --> 13:45.491
knows nothing.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.285
Oh, you know something--

13:47.368 --> 13:49.245
how to be a real schmuck.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.749
I talked last.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.586
[quirky dramatic music]

14:02.967 --> 14:04.093
[laughs]

14:04.177 --> 14:06.512
That was a productive lunch, Sharon.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.722
So what's the weekend looking like?

14:07.805 --> 14:09.682
Schlepping the twins
around Westchester, I bet.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.808
[laughs]

14:10.892 --> 14:12.101
Can I help you, sir?

14:12.185 --> 14:13.311
Oh, please.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.979
"Sir" is Sir Anthony Hopkins' name.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.564
Call me someone who works here.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.690
Step aside, sir.

14:17.774 --> 14:21.652
Look, I just need to talk to someone
about the money you guys owe me.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.196
Unrelated question:

14:23.279 --> 14:26.407
how often do you receive big cakes
that a person could fit in?

14:28.534 --> 14:30.578
Good afternoon, Mr. Bortz.
Are they expecting you?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.621
Oh, call me Dale.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.790
I'm just going in to record
a couple radio spots.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.541
Shouldn't take long, and then...

14:35.625 --> 14:37.043
[in cartoon bladder's voice]
it's time to go, girl.

14:37.126 --> 14:39.837
[both laugh]

14:42.173 --> 14:45.134
[indistinct, panicked chatter]

14:48.012 --> 14:50.640
[spluttering]

14:50.723 --> 14:52.642
Ugh! Whistle noise!

14:53.393 --> 14:55.436
You guys are being lied to!

14:55.520 --> 14:57.563
You don't need to stock up on

14:57.647 --> 14:59.440
Vaseline or...

14:59.524 --> 15:00.566
more Vaseline?

15:00.650 --> 15:04.487
I'd also love to buy your shoes, you know,
if you've ever worn them without socks.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.365
Seriously, don't listen to the news!

15:07.448 --> 15:08.699
It's all lies!

15:08.783 --> 15:11.244
[cell phone ringing]

15:11.327 --> 15:13.704
Titus, no one will listen to me.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.915
I'm glad you asked, Kimmy.
I found him. Me.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.125
I'm white.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.292
Wait. Who?

15:18.376 --> 15:20.002
The monster masquerading as "moy."

15:20.086 --> 15:20.920
Keep up.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.213
<i>But no one here will listen to me,</i>

15:22.296 --> 15:24.215
so I have to find that phony
and make him tell the truth.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.176
Titus, you're a genius!

15:27.260 --> 15:29.429
[chuckles] Almost a perfect 100 IQ.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.390
Drench Thunderman's on TV
saying the world is ending,

15:32.473 --> 15:35.017
but I can't convince everyone in New York
that he's a liar.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.354
So I have to find him
and make him fess up.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.149
Oh, but you don't want to go
confronting him without practicing first.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.567
<i>What if you mess up?</i>

15:42.650 --> 15:46.654
Ugh! If only there were another TV liar
you could confront first.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.073
But, Titus, there is!

15:49.157 --> 15:51.159
Your liar guy!

15:51.242 --> 15:53.411
Is there any chance I can come--

15:53.494 --> 15:55.705
Fifty-third and Sixth,
across from the Sbarro's.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.082
Sbarro's: let the airport come to you.

15:59.459 --> 16:04.297
Artie Goodman and his progress
and his dolphin-safe tuna.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.299
I mean, why do we have to keep them safe?

16:06.382 --> 16:08.092
They're riddled with STDs.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.385
Just look it up.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.511
Whoa, whoa.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.846
Be careful, lady.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.639
Oh, what is this,

16:13.723 --> 16:16.309
one of those fake subway stations
that creeps build

16:16.392 --> 16:21.439
where the stairs just lead to a room
with a dirty parasol and a video camera?

16:21.522 --> 16:23.941
You would think that, being so far uptown.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.402
This is the South Doggypaws stop
on the T train.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.488
The T train? That's the--

16:28.571 --> 16:30.406
Second Avenue Subway. I know!

16:30.490 --> 16:31.782
It's finally happening.

16:31.866 --> 16:34.744
I guess jet packs are next.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.623
Oh. I'm not invited
to your fancy rooftop party, Stacy?

16:38.706 --> 16:43.336
Oh. I gave up on the Second Avenue Subway
40 years ago.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.670
Am I dreaming?

16:44.754 --> 16:46.255
Hey, punch me in the face.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.633
You know they were
supposed to stop at 125th,

16:48.716 --> 16:50.676
but now they got that
big sludgefront development

16:50.760 --> 16:52.178
with the fancy grocery store.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.804
Progress, I guess.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.891
[rousing orchestral music]

16:58.935 --> 17:01.270
It's time to go, girl.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.611
[car beeps]

17:08.694 --> 17:11.696
[Titus] It's time to stop, Mr. Dale Bortz.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.949
Oh, God, it's you.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.826
Look, man, I don't want any trouble.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.453
Too bad,

17:17.537 --> 17:20.080
'cause I'm like the game closet
at Jeanie Shamanski's house.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.332
All I got is Trouble!

17:21.415 --> 17:22.625
[Dale] Please, please, don't hurt me!

17:22.708 --> 17:24.042
I have ferrets at home!

17:24.126 --> 17:27.171
You better make like me eating beans drunk
and spill the beans.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.339
And then eat them off the floor!

17:28.422 --> 17:29.674
Shut up, girl.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.093
How'd you steal my voice?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.595
How do you think?
He's an Ursula the Sea Witch, Titus.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.389
No. No. I'm an impressionist.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.974
They showed me your audition.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.392
It's on my phone in my pocket.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.065
Oh.

I said no throwing!

17:47.650 --> 17:49.193

17:49.277 --> 17:51.070
That's why they call me Catchin' Titus.

ferret wedding.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.742

-[men grunting]

18:34.447 --> 18:37.491
[Richard] <i>Damn it, it's like that time</i>
<i>a bear drowned in my pool.</i>

18:37.575 --> 18:40.161
[sighs] <i>Rule one: make them remember you.</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:44.123
<i>Foop. It's time to go, girl.</i>

18:46.417 --> 18:48.544
They used every part of the Titus,

18:48.628 --> 18:50.880
including my ability
to make up catchphrases at will.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.298
"Get small, <i>muchachos.</i>"

18:54.383 --> 18:55.551
[Kimmy] Titus, wait.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.053
There's more videos of you on there.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.679
What? How?

18:58.763 --> 19:01.182
This is Big Pharma
we're talking about, man.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.266
They're everywhere.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.019
They've had a P.I.
following you around for months,

19:05.102 --> 19:07.772
taping you so I could learn your voice.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.691
<i>Excuse me. You only gave me a bun.</i>

19:10.775 --> 19:11.776
<i>No, sir.</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:13.486
<i>You turn around and eat hot dog.</i>

19:13.569 --> 19:14.987
<i>You still chewing it!</i>

19:15.071 --> 19:17.823
<i>Oh, so that's why</i>
<i>you run a hot dog cart--</i>

19:17.907 --> 19:19.742
<i>because you're a mouth expert!</i>

19:19.825 --> 19:22.286
[Kimmy] <i> So Black History Month</i>
<i>is every other month</i>

19:22.370 --> 19:23.913
<i>and you're not allowed to walk?</i>

19:23.996 --> 19:26.248
<i>That's the rules they did</i>
<i>while you were in the bunker.</i>

19:26.332 --> 19:29.126
[Titus] <i>Okay, nerd,</i>
<i>let's get something straight.</i>

19:29.210 --> 19:32.505
Well, the joke's on them,
'cause now I have proof.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.840
Let me just email this to myself.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.219
Titus@turkishhackers.con...

19:38.302 --> 19:39.345
with an N.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.389
[yelps]

19:42.598 --> 19:45.101
You've got to give me a high five
after that.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.103
I can't. It's Black History Month.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.229
Can I go now?

19:48.312 --> 19:49.939
I have to leave before the storm hits.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.565
Mini Coopers shrink when they get wet.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.492
Time to go fudge up a weatherman.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.620
[Kimmy] Come on, Drench.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.123
Come outside and see your storm.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.458
You know, someday a real rain will come

20:09.542 --> 20:12.336
and wash all the scum off the streets.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.548
-[banging and whirring]
-[crunches]

20:15.631 --> 20:18.759
You know, that is
a very advanced question, YUKO.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.720
I love your curiosity.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.389
But, in fact, no,
rain and tears are different.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.432
See, the--

20:24.515 --> 20:26.642
You're gonna rot in heck
for tricking people!

20:26.726 --> 20:30.688
'Cause tricks are for kids,
and I'm all out of kids.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.064
Is this about the money I owe?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.941
I thought all parts of the buffet
were unlimited!

20:34.024 --> 20:36.610
Admit there's no storm, Drench Thunderman.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.529
[grunts] What?

20:38.612 --> 20:40.573
You're just scaring people
so they'll keep watching.

20:40.656 --> 20:43.325
Okay, maybe I go a little overboard.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.326
A little?

20:44.410 --> 20:47.163
You make the movie <i>Overboard</i>
look like a lighthearted comedy

20:47.246 --> 20:48.914
instead of a messed-up story
about a handyman

20:48.998 --> 20:51.083
enslaving a woman with a brain injury.

20:52.042 --> 20:52.960
You lied.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.171
No, I just need people to listen.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.007
The data says Tammi-with-an-I
is gonna hammer New York.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.094
Yeah, sometimes I'm wrong,
like with Hermine and Matthew.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.929
But Sandy was terrible.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.848
Every weather system is unique,

21:05.931 --> 21:07.892
but today the barometer is falling,

21:07.975 --> 21:09.101
the Atlantic is too warm,

21:09.185 --> 21:11.604
and my calf implants are killing me.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.397
There is a storm coming.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.609
Okay.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.444
Maybe you're not lying.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.945
Only about my name.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.864
It's actually Ricky Ann Sprinkles.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.783
And every storm is different.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.952
Exactly, just like snowflakes
or Subway sandwich artists.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.996
Or bunkers.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.333
Maybe a bunker can be a good thing,

21:32.416 --> 21:34.043
a safe place.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.297
I've got a bunker to build.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.094
Well, you were a lot of help!

21:44.178 --> 21:46.138
What if that had been the guy
from Golden Corral?

21:46.222 --> 21:47.097
[YUKO whirs and clicks]

21:49.934 --> 21:51.602
All right, Titus, you got us.

21:51.685 --> 21:55.189
We based the Urethrex bladder on you.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.315
Mm-hmm.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.691
Bitch better have my money.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.819
The thing is, bitch doesn't have to have
your money.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.238
See, you signed a blanket release
at your audition.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.699
We own your voice, your likeness,
and your unique sense of style.

22:05.783 --> 22:06.867
You mean Uptown Gayby?

22:06.951 --> 22:09.453
We call it Dumpster Sassy, but, yes.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.539
I don't overstand.
I don't even understand.

22:11.622 --> 22:14.333
If you liked me so much,
why didn't you hire me?

22:15.251 --> 22:16.085
[both laugh]

22:16.168 --> 22:18.879
Titus, after that audition,
we knew two things.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.756
There was no way we were gonna hire you.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.467
And we had a whole new concept
for the Urethrex campaign.

22:23.551 --> 22:26.262
You see, the original bladder
was more of an Urkel,

22:26.345 --> 22:28.931
a sweet nerd who shows up
whenever he isn't wanted.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.849
Nerds are the worst. I shove them.

22:30.933 --> 22:32.560
Your nonsense made us realize

22:32.643 --> 22:35.354
that the bladder could be
much more effective as a villain.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.272
[Titus] Villain?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.649
But Titus the bladder is a hero.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.902
He keeps that lady from getting
on a smelly outdoor horse.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.738
He stops her from hanging out
with a child.

22:44.822 --> 22:48.200
He saves her from dancing
with that basic husband of hers.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.203
That guy puts the "no thanks"
in "thanks, but no thanks."

22:51.287 --> 22:52.246
No.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.373
Those are all things
the woman wants to do.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.541
The bladder isn't a hero.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.501
It's ruining that woman's life,

22:57.585 --> 22:59.295
like you ruined your audition.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.882
So I'm the bad guy?

23:05.884 --> 23:08.804
[bittersweet music]

23:11.056 --> 23:14.727
There was a hot dog in that bun.
I was just trying to get another one.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.522
We know, Titus.

[men] Hey, hey, ho, ho!

23:37.416 --> 23:39.752

-[Tony] You're a scab!

23:41.920 --> 23:44.256
[men] It takes five guys to watch a hole.

23:44.340 --> 23:45.591
[Lillian] Hey.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.968
You want to know what's wrong with me?

23:48.052 --> 23:49.845
I hate change,

23:49.928 --> 23:53.349
'cause every change in my life
has been rotten--

23:53.432 --> 23:57.770
my husband dying,
me constantly getting hit by Citi Bikes,

23:57.853 --> 24:00.356
caller ID ruining my crank yanking,

24:00.439 --> 24:01.982
and this mole.

24:02.066 --> 24:03.317
Looks like a skull.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.778
This morning, it was Michigan.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.946
It's changing too fast.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.948
[men chanting indistinctly]

24:10.032 --> 24:11.367
But then...

24:11.450 --> 24:15.496
I saw the South Doggypaws subway station.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.416
All my life, progress has been a lie.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.879
But then you put your money
where your mouth is.

24:23.962 --> 24:29.218
And now I'd like to put my mouth
where your mouth is.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.473
[dramatic music]

24:37.685 --> 24:39.395
[Lillian gasping] Whoa.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.647
-You taste like Velamints.
-Oh.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.191
-Oh! Oh, brother.
-[thunder rumbles]

24:44.274 --> 24:45.693
Oh, w-we better get out of here.

24:45.776 --> 24:46.735
We'll catch our death.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.237
We better get inside.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.614
We can't be out in the rain at our age.

24:50.698 --> 24:51.782
My sister-in-law, Phyllis--

24:51.865 --> 24:54.535
very active, tennis group,
the whole thing--

24:54.618 --> 24:57.121
goes outside one time with wet hair...

24:57.204 --> 24:58.038
dead!

24:58.122 --> 25:00.040
-Dead? Oh.
-We'll get a cab.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.001
But they charge two bucks
just to turn on the meter.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.004
And do I swipe my charge card,
or is it this business with the chip?

25:06.088 --> 25:07.965
Oh, the amazing chip.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.968
-[dreamy music]
-[thunder rumbling]

25:14.471 --> 25:16.765
-[men cheering]
-I love love.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.855
Titus, I'm building a bunker,

25:22.938 --> 25:24.022
here in this apartment.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.692
But it's gonna be my bunker this time.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.110
So it's gonna be fair.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.737
People don't get extra beans

25:29.820 --> 25:31.822
just because they went as the Reverend
for Halloween.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.115
It's gonna be fun.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.451
We're gonna play those board games
I found in the trash.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.997
Wait.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.166
Why are you doing the Barbies' hair?

25:42.249 --> 25:45.085
You only do Salon de Titus
when you're upset.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.630
I'm a villain, Kimmy.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.966
Maybe that's why I love capes so much.

25:51.049 --> 25:54.762
[mysterious musical flourish]

25:54.845 --> 25:57.723
All these years,
I blamed a cruel and jealous world

25:57.806 --> 25:59.975
for my lack of success, but it's my fault.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.686
Because like that little bladder,
I only care about number one.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.772
Come on. That's not true.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.649
I've ruined every opportunity
I've ever been given.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.276
But you got that part in <i>Mahogany.</i>

26:09.359 --> 26:10.569
By accident.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.322
And they loved you.
You were the star of the show.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.991
-I bet they'd hire you again in a--
-Never.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.951
They'll never hire me again
in a million years!

26:18.035 --> 26:19.119
Why?

26:19.203 --> 26:20.412
What did you do?

26:21.371 --> 26:24.083
The worst thing Titus has ever done...

26:24.166 --> 26:25.667
the unthinkable.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.419
What are you saying, Titus?

26:27.503 --> 26:29.087
What haven't you told me?

26:29.171 --> 26:30.631
-Everything!
-[thunder crashes]

26:30.714 --> 26:33.342
But like an overactive bladder...

26:33.425 --> 26:35.511
I got to let it out, girl!

26:35.594 --> 26:37.429
[dramatic musical flourish]
