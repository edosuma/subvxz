02:00.588 --> 02:03.155
Goddamn it! Careful.

02:06.594 --> 02:07.793
It's gotta be here
somewhere.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.662
Give me your knife.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.571
Damn it!

02:25.312 --> 02:26.645
[chuckles]

02:34.321 --> 02:35.387
We're in business.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.456
Let's go.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.229
And this is for you,
asshole.

[bell dings]

03:00.314 --> 03:02.214
[people chattering]

03:04.652 --> 03:05.951
Here's for you.
Thank you.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.356
Here's for you.
<i> Gracias.</i>

03:15.362 --> 03:16.595
Your dessert, sir.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.964
What is this?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.832
The special pie
you ordered.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.269
Apple pie.
I ordered apple pie.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.308
I'll fix that right away
for you, sir. Sorry.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.813
-Hey.
-Oh. Hey.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.248
So, are you coming tonight?

03:38.953 --> 03:41.787
Dude, she's not your mom.
She can't tell you what to do.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.356
She's not gonna even know.
Besides...

03:45.659 --> 03:47.759
I raided my parents' cabinet.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.695
We'll have real fun tonight.

03:49.697 --> 03:52.531
I'll see
if I can sneak out.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.440
Hey, girl. You good?

04:01.442 --> 04:05.777
Yeah. Sorry.
Just daydreaming.
[chuckles]

04:06.647 --> 04:07.813
How's she treating you?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.884
She's a good kid.
There's no problems.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.321
She hates me.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.858
Well, you're her sister.
That's her job.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.463
Everything's gonna
be okay, Maddie.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.866
But she's going through
a really hard time
right now, you know.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.670
I don't know why I said that.
Of course you know.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.007
All right.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.319
What's that?

04:47.321 --> 04:49.621
It's pie. You eat it.

04:52.426 --> 04:53.425
You're welcome.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.765
Honey, you know
you can talk to me.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.734
Like he did?

05:04.538 --> 05:07.572
The customer?
Honey, some people
are just rude.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.374
He's an asshole.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.410
Don't use that language,
honey.
Why not?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.312
'Cause you don't?

05:14.448 --> 05:16.581
Maybe we shouldn't have
moved here.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.785
Maybe you should quit
this crappy job where assholes
get to push you around--

05:19.787 --> 05:21.653
Somebody has to
pay the bills, Emmy.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.824
I want to go home.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.695
Okay.
My shift is nearly over.
Oh, come on.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.797
I'm already a teenager.
I can take care of myself.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.732
You're 16.
Whatever.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.701
Lori is 16,
and she can do
whatever she wants.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.569
She is not you.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.372
Well, you're not Mom.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.581
Okay, let me get you
some milk.

05:49.583 --> 05:50.615
Finish your homework.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.384
[wheezing gasps]

05:54.588 --> 05:55.987
Hey, you okay?

05:55.989 --> 05:57.022
Emmy.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.125
Emmy, you okay?

06:01.495 --> 06:02.794
[wheezing]
Hey.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.363
Where's your inhaler?

06:04.365 --> 06:06.465
It's at home.
It's okay.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.767
[wheezing gasp]
It's okay.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.482
We got bigger problems
than your face.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.152
This thing
needs a pass code.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.856
Well, what about this?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.592
I don't know. Toss it.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.465
About that phone--

06:40.467 --> 06:42.100
Good thing
I got an app for that.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.172
-[device beeps]
-Boom, boom...

06:47.174 --> 06:48.807
Unlocked.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.910
The hell?
All this shit's in code.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.746
Nothing but initials.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.781
Look.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.116
You see? There.

06:58.118 --> 07:02.754
He sent the message
to a 596 prefix.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.589
That's the police department.
Fuck!

07:05.893 --> 07:07.726
Motherfucking snitch!

07:08.729 --> 07:10.462
What's it say?

07:10.464 --> 07:12.464
I don't know.
It's just an address.
Maybe a meeting spot.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.467
We need to find him

07:15.469 --> 07:17.836
before that son of a bitch
lets them know where we are.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.038
Maybe we should let him.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.039
What?

07:22.910 --> 07:25.744
Look, I'm gonna send him
a new meeting spot.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.515
That way,
we don't have to find him.
He'll find us.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.132
[man] Hey, Steve.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.634
Lieutenant, come on.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.939
-I'm ignoring you, Tony.
-Not today, Steve.

07:53.941 --> 07:57.242
What are you, my stalker?
I just finished a double.
Can't this wait?

07:57.244 --> 08:00.245
It can't.
I just got a text from Gonzales,
our CI in the flatlands.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.148
Jimmy fucking Gonzo?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.150
It doesn't make sense.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.785
I talked to him today.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.021
He said
he was going radio silent.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.191
He's not radio silent.
He just sent me a text
to a meeting place.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.993
And why was he
going off-grid?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.662
-He wanted to lie low.
-Do you believe him?

08:20.968 --> 08:23.869
Of course not.
He's a dealer and a CI.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.705
Paranoia
is his second nature.

08:26.707 --> 08:29.074
He reached out.
Maybe it's an emergency.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.042
[chuckles] Maybe.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.545
Yeah, maybe
he was really made.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.280
Well, we need to
check it out, Steve.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.018
You check out
the meeting.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.187
I'm gonna run by
his place.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.264
[woman speaking in Spanish
over PA]

08:58.005 --> 09:00.772
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I had no idea that she
had left it at home.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.909
You've got to double-check.
This is the third time
she's been in this month.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.747
Uh, yes. No, I'm sorry.
I won't let it happen again.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.181
Your sister's young.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.019
Too much excitement or trauma
can make her hyperventilate.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.288
That will trigger
the asthma.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.758
The more mature she is,
the less prone she'll be
to triggering these attacks.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.794
Until then, she depends
on you. Okay?
Yes.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.631
So how are you doing?
Are you enjoying
Puerto Rico?

09:26.633 --> 09:28.967
Yeah.
Keeping busy? Work?

09:28.969 --> 09:32.771
I just want you to know,
if you're overwhelmed,

09:32.773 --> 09:35.340
you need someone to speak to,
we've got professionals here.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.109
Thank you, Doctor. I'm good.
I just want to make sure
my sister's okay.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.650
[breathing deeply]

09:49.590 --> 09:51.256
This is stupid.

09:51.258 --> 09:55.860
No, stupid is
leaving your inhaler at home.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.964
I hate it. All the other kids
make fun of me because of it.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.198
Why do they make fun
of you?

10:01.602 --> 10:03.668
They're kids.
What kids do.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.670
[sighs]

10:05.672 --> 10:10.742
-When do we get to go home?
-They want to keep you
overnight.

10:10.744 --> 10:11.810
Again?

10:12.980 --> 10:14.079
Yeah.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.083
Stay with me.

10:18.085 --> 10:22.287
Honey, I can't.
I've got to get back to work.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.190
Visiting hours are already over,
and I've gotta get back
to my second shift.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.860
I don't want to stay here
alone.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.063
You'll be okay.
I'll be back in the morning,
and you've got this.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.169
Hey. Hey, hey.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.673
Please?

10:54.354 --> 10:57.188
Honey, I... Honey, I can't.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.859
Just because
you hate hospitals.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.094
Nobody likes hospitals.

11:04.398 --> 11:06.164
Except maybe sick people.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.167
Sick people
hate them the most.

Yeah, baby. No rush.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.312
<i>Are you doing okay?</i>
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.947
They're, uh...
They're keeping her overnight.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.249
And you're not gonna stay?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.720
[sighs] I don't know.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.788
Just, after my mom's accident,
it just...

12:05.025 --> 12:07.425
Spending time in hospitals,
you know?

12:07.427 --> 12:12.263
Well, if you're not doing
anything after your shift,
come over to my place.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.265
We could drink some boxed wine,

12:14.267 --> 12:16.234
<i>maybe watch some trash TV.</i>

12:16.236 --> 12:17.769
Okay.
I'll see how I feel.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.476

<i>I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

It's actually not much more
than a puncture wound.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.692
All things considered,
it could've been much worse.

18:14.694 --> 18:19.397
You could've shattered
your femur or severed
your femoral artery or--

18:19.399 --> 18:21.599
Okay, I... I get it. Um--

18:21.601 --> 18:24.469
When are you taking this
out of me?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.671
Not tonight.
Everything else
checks out okay.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.409
Our surgeons
are out for tonight.
We're trying to fit you in.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.446
Probably in a day or two.
How are you feeling?

18:35.448 --> 18:36.614
Uh...

18:37.784 --> 18:40.218
A little sore.
Mostly tired.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.620
Um...

18:42.622 --> 18:45.323
What happened
to the other man?

18:47.327 --> 18:49.861
We did all we could.

18:49.863 --> 18:53.231
Which reminds me--
Are you up for a visitor?
The police are here.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.867
I-I really don't
remember anything.
I know.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.503
They still want
to speak with you.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.805
The detective
is quite insistent.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.190
Hi, Madison.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.459
I'm Lieutenant Wakes.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.163
Heard you had
a pleasant night.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.231
Ah.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.433
Yeah, it was wonderful.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.206
You feeling up to this?

19:36.476 --> 19:37.742
Up to what?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.710
Just a few questions.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.446
Just about what you saw,
who you might have seen,

19:42.882 --> 19:44.649
and what happened.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.418
Uh, I really don't
remember anything.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.354
Nothing?

19:50.356 --> 19:53.691
I have to ask.
It's my job.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.661
I blacked out,
so I-I really can't help you.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.430
I'm so sorry. I-I...
I don't remember anything.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.503
[sighs]
Madison, you have to try.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.371
You have to help me.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.775
I can't help you
unless you help me.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.677
I know it's frightening.
I'm sorry.

20:14.614 --> 20:15.846
[yelps]

20:17.350 --> 20:18.816
[gasps]

20:18.818 --> 20:21.319
-Madison?
-Jesus, someone tried
to kill me.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.291
Did you see the shooter?

20:27.293 --> 20:29.594
No, um--

20:29.596 --> 20:33.297
There were just some shadows
in the dark.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.834
Shadows?

20:37.937 --> 20:39.870
As in plural?

20:39.872 --> 20:41.472
Yeah.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.673
You sure?

20:44.244 --> 20:47.945
Mm-hmm.
I only saw one guy
by the Dumpster.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.881
No. Um--

20:52.652 --> 20:54.885
No, there were two of them.
There was...

20:54.887 --> 20:58.356
one at the, um--
at the end of the alley.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.392
Did you hear anything?
Any voices?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.893
Anything, really.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.996
I just heard, um--
heard gunshots.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.867
They sounded, um,
really sharp, small.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.438
That's a .40-caliber bullet.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.877
Doc confirmed it.
You're a very lucky girl.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.349
Do you remember
anything else at all?
A name?

21:26.819 --> 21:28.319
You can help me.

21:29.856 --> 21:30.955
I'm sorry.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.391
Can I ask...

21:34.994 --> 21:37.461
Who was that guy?
What is this about?

21:39.866 --> 21:41.532
He was my partner.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.837
These guys
killed a cop.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.540
They're dangerous,

21:49.542 --> 21:51.575
and you're a witness.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.378
Are they gonna
come after me?

21:55.615 --> 21:56.714
Possible.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.821
[siren chirping]
[people chattering]

22:11.397 --> 22:13.464
[woman speaking in Spanish
over PA]

22:17.904 --> 22:21.038
<i> Members of the Wi family,</i>
<i> please report to reception,</i>

22:21.040 --> 22:23.341
<i> located on the first floor.</i>

22:32.785 --> 22:34.719
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.789
Sergeant Tull, Vice Division.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.791
What happened to the girl
that was here earlier,

22:40.793 --> 22:42.727
the one that was shot
in the leg?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.028
I'm not sure.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.063
They rushed her
out of here,

22:46.065 --> 22:49.033
took her somewhere else,
all hush-hush.

22:50.503 --> 22:51.769
Take us to Security.

23:00.446 --> 23:04.014
This is the seventh floor.
Infectious diseases.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.550
Not as bad as it sounds.

23:07.987 --> 23:11.789
Half the floor
is disease labs.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.658
The other half
is the isolation ward.

23:14.660 --> 23:17.995
Isolation ward?
This just gets
better and better.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.030
It's where they quarantine
those patients.

23:22.001 --> 23:26.570
Don't worry. We haven't had
any outbreaks of Ebola. Yet.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.740
Am I the only one
on this floor?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.709
Yes.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.145
This is the safest
place for you.

23:34.147 --> 23:37.548
Sorry, sir.
I, uh, just finished
clearing the floor.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.750
This is Officer Jacobs.

23:39.752 --> 23:43.921
He'll be keeping
an eye on you tonight,
just in case.

23:45.491 --> 23:47.825
You sure I'm gonna
be safe here?

23:47.827 --> 23:50.861
We gave you an alias.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.864
Even if the killer
could find you,

23:53.866 --> 23:57.802
there's a cop, an armed cop,
right outside your door.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.704
Wait, what about my sister?

24:00.706 --> 24:03.707
I dropped her here
earlier at the hospital
before everything happened.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.477
She'll be fine.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.216
I'm really sorry
I'm a lousy witness.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.019
Oh, no, don't be.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.222
You've been a great help.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.457
Really?

24:21.561 --> 24:22.693
Well, yeah.

24:22.695 --> 24:25.629
[laughs]

24:25.631 --> 24:29.600
But you did get me
out of poker night,
which is really cool.

24:32.772 --> 24:36.807
Detective, can I ask
what you're doing
in San Juan?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.077
Why everybody comes
to the island.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.013
Running from ghosts.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.816
You didn't know that?

24:47.553 --> 24:50.554
So, no family, huh?

24:51.757 --> 24:53.157
Guys like me...

24:56.262 --> 24:57.795
don't stick around.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.202
The officer
will be outside the door.

25:06.772 --> 25:08.873
If you need anything,
the nurses will be on duty.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.274
Just hit the button.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.178
That your phone?

25:14.914 --> 25:16.180
Uh, yeah.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.984
I'll put my phone in, okay?

25:21.254 --> 25:24.054
Um, my cell's on here.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.657
If you have any problems,
just call me directly.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.660
Yeah.

25:30.763 --> 25:33.531
Call Lieutenant Wakes,
not 911.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.066
Perfect.

25:36.836 --> 25:37.902
Except one thing.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.238
I'd like you
to call me Steve.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.175
"To serve and protect."

25:47.213 --> 25:49.313
Let's see. Madison Taylor.

25:50.149 --> 25:53.317
And, uh, Emily Taylor.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.086
Her sister, I believe.
Staying at the children's ward.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.989
Uh, no, just-- just Madison.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.592
And the officer that,
uh, came by

26:01.594 --> 26:03.594
and wanted to move her,
his name was?

26:03.596 --> 26:06.630
Uh, Wakes. Lieutenant Wakes.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.098
Wakes.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.968
And you said they moved her
to the seventh floor?

26:10.970 --> 26:13.270
Yes. Quarantine room 707.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.206
That's been closed
due to Hurricane Maria's damage.

26:16.208 --> 26:19.677
Is she some kind of
witness or something?
Not exactly.

26:19.679 --> 26:23.047
We believe she's a person
of interest with new
information that came in.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.885
Well, I can round up staff
if you need backup.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.753
No, no,
we can't involve civilians.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.990
But what you can do
is lock down
that seventh floor.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.325
Well,

26:34.327 --> 26:37.094
I can initiate
an elevator lockdown

26:37.096 --> 26:41.832
that will restrict the elevators
to key-card access only.

26:41.834 --> 26:45.135
Now, the stairs,
I can lock those from here
only on the stairwell side.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.837
Thanks.

26:46.839 --> 26:50.140
And do me a favor.
Alert the staff.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.977
Let them know to report
anything that's suspicious.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.679
And keep them out of our way
for their own safety.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.851
Wakes is in charge
of special projects
for major crimes, right?

27:00.853 --> 27:02.653
Now we know
who's pulling the strings.

27:02.655 --> 27:05.155
Marcos and Williams
clean up the scene?

27:06.993 --> 27:08.726
Yeah.

27:08.728 --> 27:11.028
You know, Wakes is one
of those diligent fucks.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.130
He's not gonna stop at this.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.766
I'm gonna put Marcos
and Williams on him.

27:15.768 --> 27:16.834
Good idea.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.938
[phone chimes]

27:34.987 --> 27:38.222
Yeah, we see him posted.
We'll let him know
we're taking over.

27:38.224 --> 27:42.893
Whoa, hey.
You guys can't be up here.
This area is off limits.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.929
Hey, relax, kid.
We're here to relieve you.

27:45.931 --> 27:49.066
Lieutenant Wakes
didn't say anything
about a relief shift.

27:49.068 --> 27:52.202
Consider yourself lucky.
Why don't you take a break?

27:52.204 --> 27:54.438
I, uh, got to check with Wakes.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.441
Yeah, <i> no problemo.</i>
I have him right here.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.016
You should've taken
the night off, kiddo.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.052
Let's go.

28:12.725 --> 28:15.392
[inhales sharply, groans]

28:20.266 --> 28:22.800

[groans]

28:33.412 --> 28:35.345
[footsteps]

28:44.423 --> 28:46.457
I'll lock up the stairwells.
You disable the switchboard.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.297

29:43.916 --> 29:45.249

31:24.450 --> 31:25.649

31:30.322 --> 31:33.457
Yeah. This is it.
Then where in the hell
is she?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.626
[door opens]
That door's locked
from the inside.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.431
Goddamn it!
There's another door!

33:36.215 --> 33:38.115
Did you...
Yeah.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.216
Locked them out.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.087
She's near the elevator.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.061

No one's gonna help you,

36:59.818 --> 37:03.486
[pounding on door]
I've already called the police.

37:03.488 --> 37:05.589
We are the fucking police.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.257
Open the door!

37:12.331 --> 37:14.497
Pierce, put that down.

37:24.309 --> 37:25.408
<i>Madison?</i>

37:29.948 --> 37:31.748
How do you know my name?

37:31.750 --> 37:34.351
We are the police, Madison.
We're the good guys.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.853
Everything is okay.
It's just a misunderstanding.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.855
But he was chasing me
with a gun.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.393
<i>Yeah, that was a mistake.</i>

37:43.395 --> 37:45.762
You see, my partner here
thought that you were, um...

37:46.498 --> 37:47.664
someone else.

37:48.834 --> 37:52.269
Listen.
My name is Sergeant Tull.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.338
We were responding to a call
made by Protective Services.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.574
<i>That's the police guard</i>
<i>that was protecting you earlier.</i>

37:57.576 --> 38:01.411
When we arrived to the scene,
we found him dead
and you missing.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.281
<i>Somebody killed him.</i>

38:05.784 --> 38:08.718
-It was you. You killed him.
-No.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.554
<i>It was someone</i>
<i>who was after you.</i>

38:14.660 --> 38:16.760
We secured the floor
room by room,

38:16.762 --> 38:19.296
<i>and that's when you popped up</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

38:19.298 --> 38:21.931
My partner... [chuckles]

38:21.933 --> 38:25.935
Detective Pierce, well,
you can tell that you
spooked him pretty bad.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.604
<i>He thought you were the perp.</i>

38:28.407 --> 38:29.973
You know, it's dark,

38:29.975 --> 38:33.476
the adrenaline is pumping,
you're not thinking straight.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.580
<i>Now, yes, he did</i>
<i>have his gun out, but we</i>
<i>were looking for the perp.</i>

Hundred bucks says
there's a gallon in the trunk.

1:06:54.144 --> 1:06:56.077
Along with Jimmy's body.

1:07:09.159 --> 1:07:12.260
I need units
at Midtown General.

Repeat, Code Three.

1:07:17.167 --> 1:07:18.800
<i> Ten minutes ETA. Over.</i>

1:07:18.802 --> 1:07:20.235
Ten minutes?

1:07:27.611 --> 1:07:29.577
[sirens wailing in distance]

1:07:48.698 --> 1:07:50.532
She's here. I know it.

1:07:51.701 --> 1:07:53.601
[Tull]
<i> Perfect. Put her on.</i>

1:07:55.806 --> 1:07:57.205

1:07:58.475 --> 1:07:59.741
<i> Madison.</i>

1:08:03.213 --> 1:08:05.613
I have someone here who, um,

1:08:05.615 --> 1:08:07.115
wants to say hello.

1:08:14.324 --> 1:08:16.591
Maddie,
why are the police here?

1:08:20.497 --> 1:08:22.097
It's real simple, Maddie.

1:08:23.166 --> 1:08:25.467
Come on out,
and I'll let her go.

1:08:27.604 --> 1:08:30.839
<i> Madison,</i>
<i> this is your last chance.</i>

1:08:32.542 --> 1:08:35.110
<i> Don't make this harder</i>
<i> than it already is.</i>

1:08:37.114 --> 1:08:39.114

1:09:10.914 --> 1:09:13.348
[screaming]

1:09:16.219 --> 1:09:17.752
It's okay.

1:09:17.754 --> 1:09:19.454
Everything is just fine.

1:09:28.498 --> 1:09:29.564
[woman] <i> Madison?</i>

1:09:41.478 --> 1:09:44.512
We're keeping
her body alive, but...

1:09:44.514 --> 1:09:45.947
but it's just her body.

1:09:47.350 --> 1:09:49.317
How, uh-- How long?

1:09:49.319 --> 1:09:54.389
Your parents' insurance
only covers 30 days

1:09:54.391 --> 1:09:56.424
of life support
in these situations.

1:09:56.426 --> 1:09:59.260
But you're gonna have to
make a decision soon.

1:10:05.569 --> 1:10:07.202
I'm so sorry, Madison.

1:10:11.408 --> 1:10:12.941
Did you ask him,
Maddie?

1:10:14.878 --> 1:10:16.978
Did you ask him
if she's gonna wake up?

1:10:31.294 --> 1:10:32.360
Wake up.

1:10:34.397 --> 1:10:35.830
Maddie, wake up.

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:39.634
-Wake up!

1:10:44.808 --> 1:10:46.374
I think that one worked.

1:10:52.549 --> 1:10:54.582
What do you want from me?

1:10:54.584 --> 1:10:57.285
Well, at first
we wanted that bullet
out of your leg.

1:10:59.522 --> 1:11:02.423
But, you see,
my partner here, the genius,

1:11:02.425 --> 1:11:05.593
he shot you
with his service gun,
and he's a cop.

1:11:05.595 --> 1:11:07.595
Which means his ballistics
are in the system,

1:11:07.597 --> 1:11:09.631
which puts us
at the scene of the crime.

1:11:12.302 --> 1:11:16.671
We really need to know,
where did you put
that video card?

1:11:16.673 --> 1:11:19.474
-If you touch my sister--
-Shh. Stop.

1:11:19.476 --> 1:11:21.776
You are in no position
to make any threats.

1:11:23.546 --> 1:11:25.713
I've already called the cops.
They're on their way.

1:11:25.715 --> 1:11:27.649
You mean your buddy,
Wakes?

1:11:28.885 --> 1:11:30.785
He ain't coming
to save you.

1:11:32.789 --> 1:11:34.355
There's no one coming.

1:11:34.357 --> 1:11:36.491
It's just you and us.

1:11:37.994 --> 1:11:39.794
Come on, Madison.

1:11:39.796 --> 1:11:44.299
Tell us where the card is,
and I promise
I'll make this quick.

1:11:44.301 --> 1:11:47.502
It'll only hurt
a little bit.
Scout's honor.

1:11:47.504 --> 1:11:49.737
[chuckles] Fuck you.

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.907
Still need to
get that bullet out.

1:11:52.909 --> 1:11:54.942
Why don't we start
by digging?

1:11:57.047 --> 1:11:58.613
[Tull] Wait.

1:11:58.615 --> 1:12:01.049
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:12:01.051 --> 1:12:04.319
If you do that, we're not
gonna be able to find it.
She's gonna bleed out.

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:10.358
Madison, I have to say
I'm very,
very disappointed in you.

1:12:12.362 --> 1:12:14.362
But maybe
I should go get your sister.

1:12:14.364 --> 1:12:16.898
Maybe that
will speed the process up
a little bit.

1:12:18.068 --> 1:12:19.934
I'll be right back.

1:12:19.936 --> 1:12:21.969

-The shooter?
-What? Not--

No. No, no.
The girl, Madison.

1:12:44.961 --> 1:12:48.830
The other cops are searching
for her now. They said
she was the shooting suspect.

1:12:48.832 --> 1:12:50.998
Security had to close off
most of the floors.

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.469
-Close off what?
-All of it. Come with me.

Stop it. Leave her alone.
That's an order.

Damn it.
I had the information
almost from her.

Oh. Now, you're no fun.
