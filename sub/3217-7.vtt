I have one just like it.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.543
Pete gave it to me.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.177
-Now this all makes perfect sense.
-I'm sorry?

34:57.386 --> 34:59.596
Yeah, you see,
Claire is not a vengeful spirit.

34:59.806 --> 35:00.847
She's a death omen.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.849
Excuse me?

35:03.017 --> 35:05.393
Claire's not killing anyone.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.020
She's trying to warn them.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.359
See, sometimes spirits don't
want vengeance, they want justice.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.236
Which is why she led us here.

35:14.403 --> 35:16.571
She wants us to know
who her killer is.

35:21.577 --> 35:23.745
How much do you know
about your partner?

35:27.458 --> 35:30.127
-Oh, my God.
-What?

35:31.087 --> 35:35.882
About a year ago, some heroin
went missing from lockup.

35:36.092 --> 35:38.051
Obviously it was a cop.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.846
We never found out who did it.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.641
But whoever did it would need
someone to fence their product.

35:44.892 --> 35:46.893
Somebody like a heroin dealer.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.397
Somebody like Claire.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.405
DEAN: So I'm being extradited
to St. Louis, huh?

36:00.366 --> 36:04.244
And you just decided to transfer me
yourself, 800 miles at 2 in the morning?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.418
This can't be good.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.670
All right, thanks.

36:13.880 --> 36:16.298
-What is it?
-Pete just left the precinct.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.924
-With Dean.
-What?

36:18.092 --> 36:21.428
He said the prisoner had to be
transferred, and he just took him.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.139
Dispatch has been calling.
He won't answer the radio.

36:24.515 --> 36:27.434
-Radio? He took a county vehicle?
-Yeah.

36:27.602 --> 36:30.312
It should have a LoJack.
You just gotta get it turned on.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.204

get your prostate checked.

You go do what you gotta do.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.480
You're a cocky son of a bitch.

37:13.940 --> 37:16.983
You think those people in St. Louis
are gonna buy that crap?

37:18.194 --> 37:21.655
Here's the thing.
You're not gonna make it to St. Louis.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.743
You're gonna die trying to escape.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.538
Wait. Wait.

37:31.707 --> 37:35.168
Let's talk about this. You don't wanna
do something you're gonna regret.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.088
-Or maybe you do.
BALLARD: Pete.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.466

-Diana?

37:41.676 --> 37:42.717
How'd you find me?

37:43.177 --> 37:44.511
I know about Claire.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.555
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Put the gun down.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.599
Oh, I don't think so.

37:50.017 --> 37:53.103
You're fast. Pretty sure I'm faster.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.232
-Why are you doing this?
-I didn't do anything, Diana.

37:57.692 --> 37:59.734
It's a little late for that.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.362
It wasn't my fault.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.031
Claire was gonna turn me in.
I had no choice.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.534
And Tony? Karen?

38:07.743 --> 38:09.119
Same thing.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.746
Tony scrubbed the money.
Then he got skittish...

38:11.914 --> 38:16.042
...and then he wanted to come clean.
I'm sure he told Karen everything.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.503
It was a mess, I had to clean it up.

38:19.297 --> 38:20.380
I just panicked.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.882
How many more people
are gonna die over this?

38:23.050 --> 38:25.552
There's a way out.

This Dean kid's a frigging gift.
We can pin the whole thing on him.

Okay? No trial, nothing,
just one more dead scumbag.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.813
Hey.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.400
No one will question it.

The death omen, Claire.

-What happens to her now?
-It should be over.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.453
She should be at rest.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.041
So, what now, officer?

40:20.251 --> 40:24.337
Pete did confess to me,
he screwed up both your cases royally.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.757
I'd say there's a good chance
that we can get your cases dismissed.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.468
-You could take care of that for us?
-I hope so.
