WEBVTT

00:02.166 --> 00:03.932
Hey, uh, who's
free tonight?

00:03.934 --> 00:05.667
- Oh, I think I'm...
- Hang on.

00:05.669 --> 00:06.935
We've made this
mistake before.

00:06.937 --> 00:08.470
It's how we
wound up at

00:08.472 --> 00:12.040
his cousin Deepak's
Tupperware party.

00:12.042 --> 00:13.942
Hey, you use that
collapsible bowl all the time,

00:13.943 --> 00:15.010
and you know it.

00:15.012 --> 00:16.478
And it's not
like that.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.815
I just thought we could, you
know, hang out and go to a bar.

00:19.817 --> 00:21.082
- Sure. - Very well.
- Sounds fun.

00:21.084 --> 00:22.818
And watch cricket.

00:23.754 --> 00:27.389
That sound you hear,
ironically, crickets.

00:28.859 --> 00:30.292
Hey, guys.

00:30.294 --> 00:31.493
Hey, Bert,
how you doing?

00:31.495 --> 00:32.994
Well, you know, we geologists

00:32.996 --> 00:35.964
always get a little sad
when Rocktober's over.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.900
- Wordplay?
- Yes.

00:38.902 --> 00:39.868
Funny wordplay?

00:39.870 --> 00:41.436
- What do you think?
- Eh.

00:41.438 --> 00:44.706
Trust your gut.

00:44.708 --> 00:45.841
Sheldon, I've got these

00:45.843 --> 00:47.442
four-billion-year-old
meteorites.

00:47.444 --> 00:51.046
I thought maybe they'd show
signs of neutrino interactions.

00:51.048 --> 00:53.782
I could really use someone like
you to help me with the math.

00:53.784 --> 00:58.553
Oh, so they would act as
natural dark matter detectors.

00:58.555 --> 00:59.654
That sounds interesting.

00:59.656 --> 01:02.457
It does, but it's still geology.

01:03.927 --> 01:06.595
Sorry, Bert, I don't have time
to play rocks with you.

01:06.597 --> 01:08.129
I'm not asking you
to play rocks.

01:08.131 --> 01:10.499
I'm asking you to collaborate
on a research project.

01:10.501 --> 01:11.466
Although, if
there's time,

01:11.468 --> 01:13.134
I guess we could play a round

01:13.136 --> 01:15.537
of zinc, zinc, piece of quartz.

01:16.673 --> 01:18.807
Does sound better
than cricket.

01:20.444 --> 01:21.543
Thank you for asking.

01:21.545 --> 01:23.645
Unfortunately, I have
real science to do.

01:23.647 --> 01:25.514
But you feel free
to rock on.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.782
That's how you do it.

01:27.784 --> 01:29.651
All right.

01:29.653 --> 01:30.685
Sheldon, what are you doing?

01:30.687 --> 01:32.420
Bert's one of
the top guys in his field.

01:32.422 --> 01:36.691
And somewhere there's a mime
who's top in his field,

01:36.693 --> 01:38.994
but you don't see me rushing
to collaborate with him

01:38.996 --> 01:42.397
on new ways to be
stuck in a box.

01:42.399 --> 01:46.568
Also something I would
watch instead of cricket.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:57.214 --> 01:58.213
Oh. (chuckles)

01:58.215 --> 01:59.514
Hello.

01:59.516 --> 02:01.216
Hey, Sheldon.

02:01.218 --> 02:04.286
I've been thinking
about it, and I suppose

02:04.288 --> 02:07.355
I-I could help you
with your research.

02:07.357 --> 02:08.556
What changed your mind?

02:08.559 --> 02:10.191
Bert, I'm a gift horse.

02:10.193 --> 02:12.260
Don't look me in the mouth.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.262
Sorry. I'm happy
you want to help out.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.932
If it's easier for you, we could
just work at your office.

02:16.934 --> 02:19.034
No, no, no,
not my office, no.

02:19.036 --> 02:20.869
Uh, let's-let's
do it here,

02:20.871 --> 02:24.839
in-in the evenings,
after everyone's gone home.

02:24.841 --> 02:27.542
I just have to see
if my evenings are free.

02:27.544 --> 02:29.844
That's a joke. They are.

02:29.846 --> 02:31.046
Okay.

02:31.048 --> 02:32.847
Well, then I will
see you tonight.

02:34.785 --> 02:36.017
(gasps)

02:36.019 --> 02:37.953
Well, you know what?

02:37.955 --> 02:40.655

(sportscast playing over TV)

03:10.591 --> 03:12.992
I don't get how you can
enjoy cricket.

03:12.994 --> 03:14.427
It makes no sense.

03:14.429 --> 03:16.462
Did you just come
here to complain?

03:16.464 --> 03:19.231
Yeah. That's the sport
of my people.

03:19.233 --> 03:23.536
Ooh, that's Ravichandran
Ashwin. He's amazing.

03:23.538 --> 03:27.573
He makes Hardik Pandya look
like Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

03:27.575 --> 03:31.477
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, save some
syllables for the rest of us.

03:31.479 --> 03:34.647
Hey, I think that's
Bernadette's friend over there.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.615
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, yeah.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.117
Hey, Ruchi!

03:39.487 --> 03:41.420
I-I hope this
isn't awkward.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.622
The last time we met, I
kind of embarrassed myself.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.558
Let's see if you can
go two for two.

03:45.560 --> 03:48.094
Hey, guys.
Hey.

03:48.096 --> 03:50.529
- Hi.
- Are you here by yourself?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.798
Yeah, I couldn't convince anyone
to come watch cricket with me.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.167
(chuckles) Tell me about it.
I had to drag this guy.

03:56.504 --> 03:59.071
You're more than welcome
to join us if you'd like.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.006
Thanks.

04:00.008 --> 04:02.008
(crowd groans)

04:02.010 --> 04:04.710
<i>Arre uske taang
pay ball kar!</i>

04:04.712 --> 04:05.878
What'd she say?

04:05.880 --> 04:10.016
<i>Uske taang</i>
<i>pay ball kar.</i>

04:10.018 --> 04:12.451
Oh, that clears that up.

04:12.453 --> 04:15.021
Well, no, she's telling the
bowler to bowl a yorker.

04:15.023 --> 04:17.423
It's the most brutal
ball in cricket.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.625
I was at the match when Shoaib
bowled back-to-back yorkers.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.561
Well, I was there, too!
What a coincidence!

04:22.563 --> 04:26.499
Well, there were 120,000 people
at that match, so...

04:26.501 --> 04:28.134
Yeah, India, right?
Everywhere you go,

04:28.136 --> 04:30.669
there's, like, 120,000 people.
(chuckles)

04:31.539 --> 04:32.705
So what do
you think of

04:32.707 --> 04:33.939
our chances at
the World Cup?

04:33.941 --> 04:35.207
Ah, World Cup.

04:35.209 --> 04:36.475
You know, it'll all depend

04:36.477 --> 04:38.577
if Kohli's batting in form.
I know.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.880
It doesn't even matter
how many all-rounders you have.

04:40.882 --> 04:42.348
Isn't that the truth?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.750
You know, I was the best
leg spinner in my high school?

04:44.752 --> 04:46.886
Yeah, like, I bowled
the meanest googly.

04:46.888 --> 04:49.855
Speaking of googlies,
I'm gonna go.

04:52.927 --> 04:55.828
I've been modeling different
types of dark matter

04:55.830 --> 04:57.096
and the traces they would leave

04:57.098 --> 04:58.798
on the zircon
inside your meteorite.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.067
What's this one here?

05:01.069 --> 05:03.969
That's actually a dark matter
model of my own creation.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.838
I call it the Cooper Boson.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.741
Cool. I got to name a rock once.

05:08.743 --> 05:11.644
I named it
Moderately Sedimented Shale.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.215
Guess I kind of
pooped the bed on that one.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.653
You know, Bert,
I've got to say,

05:20.655 --> 05:23.456
this work has been
surprisingly engaging.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.458
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

05:25.460 --> 05:27.893
(ringtone playing)

05:27.895 --> 05:29.261
Hello, Amy.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.496
(stammers)

05:30.498 --> 05:32.364
What do you mean,
where am I?

05:32.366 --> 05:33.766
I'm in my office.

05:33.768 --> 05:37.436
No, I'm at your office
and you're not here.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.238
I thought I'd surprise you
with dinner.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.941
For future reference,
the best surprises

05:41.943 --> 05:45.311
are the ones I know about
three days in advance.

05:45.313 --> 05:47.313
Where are you?

05:47.315 --> 05:48.747
It's a surprise.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.183
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

05:51.185 --> 05:52.551
Well, I have food.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.819
I thought we could eat together,

05:53.821 --> 05:55.654
but I guess if you have
other plans...

05:55.656 --> 05:57.723
What?! I'm here!

06:00.461 --> 06:02.328
Exactly where
I said I was.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.496
(panting)

06:03.498 --> 06:05.498
Let's eat.

06:07.702 --> 06:09.068
Hello.

06:09.070 --> 06:10.503
- Hey, buddy, what's up?
- Hey.

06:10.505 --> 06:13.372
Um, I need to talk
to Penny alone.

06:13.374 --> 06:15.474
(laughs)

06:18.212 --> 06:19.678
What can I do for you?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.481
Just a minute, I want to make
sure Leonard can't hear us.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.850
(loudly): I've got
a box of cupcakes.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.256
Okay, we're good.

06:30.258 --> 06:34.827
I'm working with Bert, but I
don't want anyone to find out.

06:34.829 --> 06:37.997
Well, you just told me,
so strong start.

06:37.999 --> 06:40.766
Penny, this is serious.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.968
My reputation
is on the line.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.938
What are people gonna think
when they see us collaborating?

06:45.940 --> 06:48.240
I don't know. Poor Bert?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.745
I am a respected
theoretical physicist.

06:52.747 --> 06:55.414
I aspire to win a
Nobel Prize someday.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.116
But nobody's gonna
take me seriously

06:57.118 --> 06:59.451
if they find out I've
been dabbling in geology.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.353
Well, why not?
They're both sciences.

07:01.355 --> 07:02.955
And I know because
they're classes

07:02.957 --> 07:07.092
my high school counselor said
“weren't for me.”

07:07.094 --> 07:10.196
They're very different.

07:10.198 --> 07:12.031
Physics answers
the question:

07:12.033 --> 07:13.999
what is the nature
of the universe?

07:14.001 --> 07:17.770
Geology answers the question:
what'd I just trip over?

07:19.574 --> 07:21.473
All right, well,
then don't work with Bert.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.709
Oh, but I like the work.
Then work with him.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.277
Yeah, but I'm ashamed
of the field.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.680
- Then don't work with him.
- Yeah, but we could prove dark matter.

07:27.682 --> 07:29.181
Then work with him.
But I just think that people...

07:29.183 --> 07:31.116
How many times are
you gonna do this?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.952
My record is 14.

07:32.954 --> 07:35.721
Okay, this is about science.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.022
Why'd you come to me?

07:37.024 --> 07:40.059
Well, because it's also
about my reputation.

07:40.061 --> 07:43.128
And somehow you manage
to hold your head high

07:43.130 --> 07:45.631
despite your checkered past.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.001
Checkered past?

07:49.003 --> 07:50.869
It's a figure of speech

07:50.871 --> 07:54.106
referring to how
sexually promiscuous you were.

07:54.108 --> 07:56.141
Really?

07:56.143 --> 07:58.010
Well, I've got
a figure of speech about

07:58.012 --> 08:01.280
how sexually promiscuous
you can go be with yourself.

08:04.185 --> 08:07.052
And what is it?

08:09.423 --> 08:11.257
Look, while Bernadette's
on bed rest,

08:11.259 --> 08:13.926
we're gonna have to
divide and conquer.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.595
I've got one monitor for her,
one for the baby.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.030
Which do you want?

08:18.032 --> 08:21.066
I'll take the baby.
She's less emasculating.

08:22.203 --> 08:24.570
Good morning!

08:24.572 --> 08:26.538
Scones?
Ah, thanks.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.808
They're all for you; I already
had breakfast at Ruchi's.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.044
You're kidding.
You slept with her?

08:32.046 --> 08:33.879
Well, there wasn't
a lot of sleeping involved.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.847
I mean, she slept,
I stayed awake.

08:35.850 --> 08:39.652
I was afraid of snoring 'cause
I didn't have my special pillow.

08:39.654 --> 08:40.653
BERNADETTE:
Howard!

08:40.655 --> 08:43.621
Can you help me
to the bathroom?!

08:43.624 --> 08:46.525
Well, at least the romance
is still alive.

08:50.131 --> 08:53.799
So, you and Ruchi?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.401
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I know you liked her, too,

08:55.403 --> 08:57.803
but we just bumped into each
other last night and hit it off.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.104
No, that's fine.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.006
You're my friend and
I'm happy for you.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.408
Oh, thank you, Stuart.

09:02.410 --> 09:04.143
Plus, I don't know
how you're gonna screw it up,

09:04.145 --> 09:05.244
but I know you will.

09:05.246 --> 09:07.379
What's there to screw up?

09:07.381 --> 09:09.181
She just wants
to keep things casual.

09:09.183 --> 09:11.016
Oh, great, that's how
you're gonna screw it up.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.986
Hey, I can be casual.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.321
Mm-hmm.

09:15.323 --> 09:17.723
I should get a haircut;
this thing's going south fast.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.827
So Ruchi and I decided
to keep things casual.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.163
(scoffs)

09:24.165 --> 09:26.999
What? What?

09:27.001 --> 09:28.600
I can handle casual.

09:28.602 --> 09:30.469
(scoffs):
Oh...

09:30.471 --> 09:33.439
Why do you keep doing that
with your face?

09:33.441 --> 09:36.141
Because you keep saying
stupid things with yours.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.277
Okay, fine.

09:38.279 --> 09:39.778
I'm not great
at casual relationships,

09:39.780 --> 09:41.847
and I don't want
to scare her off.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.282
All right, just give her
some space, all right?

09:43.284 --> 09:44.316
Don't call, don't text,
don't e-mail.

09:44.318 --> 09:45.551
That's crazy.

09:45.553 --> 09:49.154
What if I see a sunset
that reminds me of her?

09:50.925 --> 09:53.025
All right, when do you
see her next?

09:53.027 --> 09:54.393
Uh, we're having dinner tonight.

09:54.395 --> 09:57.730
Okay, put a rubber band
around your wrist,

09:57.732 --> 09:59.965
and any time you start
planning your wedding

09:59.967 --> 10:01.233
or naming your children,

10:01.235 --> 10:05.070
I want you to stab yourself
in the hand with a fork.

10:08.376 --> 10:10.376
What's the rubber band for?

10:10.378 --> 10:11.744
To slow the bleeding.

10:14.682 --> 10:17.449
Hey, how's Bernadette
handling bed rest?

10:17.451 --> 10:21.286
She lies around all day eating
Mallomars and hollering at me,

10:21.288 --> 10:26.892
so her transformation from my
wife to my mother is complete.

10:29.130 --> 10:32.398
Congratulations. I know
that's what you were hoping for.

10:34.168 --> 10:37.336
Sheldon, you left your jacket
in my office last night.

10:37.338 --> 10:38.971
Uh, oh. No-no, I didn't.

10:38.973 --> 10:40.372
That's-that's not my jacket.

10:40.374 --> 10:41.540
Then why does it say,

10:41.542 --> 10:43.809
“Property of S. Cooper.
Stop touching it”?

10:45.012 --> 10:46.378
It sounds like
someone named Scooper

10:46.380 --> 10:48.580
doesn't want you
touching his jacket.

10:49.550 --> 10:50.949
Are you guys
working together

10:50.951 --> 10:52.551
on that meteorite
project?

10:52.553 --> 10:53.485
(sighs)

10:53.487 --> 10:55.187
Yes, fine, you
found me out.

10:55.189 --> 10:56.488
I'm doing geology.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.223
Just, please, don't tell anyone.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.659
Are you embarrassed of me?

11:00.661 --> 11:02.561
Oh, no, no, no,
not you.

11:02.563 --> 11:05.998
No, just the work that you've
devoted your entire life to.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.333
If you're ashamed to be
working with me,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.502
then I don't want
to work with you.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.406
Sheldon, that was pretty rude.

11:14.408 --> 11:17.810
Well, what do you expect?
He's a geologist.

11:21.395 --> 11:23.194
This place seems nice.

11:23.196 --> 11:24.529
Uh, but not too nice.

11:24.531 --> 11:26.631
Yelp called it
“good for groups.”

11:27.467 --> 11:29.601
Would you care to buy
the lady a...?

11:29.603 --> 11:31.903
No! Get out of here!

11:32.939 --> 11:34.506
Sorry about that.

11:34.508 --> 11:37.175
I just, I hate when someone
assumes two people are dating

11:37.177 --> 11:38.443
just because they look like

11:38.445 --> 11:40.679
they would make
beautiful babies together.

11:40.681 --> 11:43.281
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

11:43.283 --> 11:46.551
Honestly, Ruchi, I don't
have a lot of experience

11:46.553 --> 11:48.586
with casual relationships.

11:48.588 --> 11:50.388
I have some experience
with serious relationships

11:50.390 --> 11:53.925
and a ton of experience
with no relationships.

11:55.762 --> 11:56.795
You're funny.

11:56.797 --> 11:59.397
Glad it came off that way.
(chuckles)

11:59.399 --> 12:02.233
Uh, so tell me about your day.

12:02.235 --> 12:03.735
How's work going?

12:03.737 --> 12:05.603
Well, I spent the morning
reviewing side effects

12:05.605 --> 12:08.440
for our fungal cream,
so it was a lot of ooze and pus.

12:08.442 --> 12:13.044
♪ Oh, almost paradise ♪

12:13.046 --> 12:17.248
♪ We're knocking on
heaven's door ♪

12:17.250 --> 12:18.350
♪ Almost paradise... ♪

12:18.352 --> 12:22.354
And then I had to catalog it

12:22.356 --> 12:26.658
by color, viscosity

12:26.660 --> 12:30.395
and percentage of blood.

12:33.133 --> 12:36.034
♪ Paradise. ♪

12:36.036 --> 12:38.470
Sounds wonderful.

12:41.775 --> 12:43.141
Hey.

12:43.143 --> 12:44.609
Hmm.

12:44.611 --> 12:46.845
What you got there?

12:46.847 --> 12:48.546
A rock.

12:50.317 --> 12:54.352
Did some mean boys
throw it at you?

12:54.354 --> 12:57.155
It turns out I'm the mean boy.

12:57.157 --> 13:01.393
Although I did drop it
on my own foot, so kind of.

13:01.395 --> 13:02.927
What's going on?

13:02.929 --> 13:06.331
What if there was
something I wanted to do,

13:06.333 --> 13:10.201
but I was worried other people
would think less of me?

13:10.203 --> 13:12.837
Is that other person me, and
does it happen in the bedroom,

13:12.839 --> 13:16.241
in which case
I think I'm cool with it?

13:19.079 --> 13:21.045
No.

13:21.047 --> 13:23.782
It's about working
with Bert on...

13:23.784 --> 13:25.450
You know what?
I'm not even gonna say it.

13:25.452 --> 13:27.952
I am just gonna say
the letter it starts with

13:27.954 --> 13:29.287
and “ology.”

13:29.289 --> 13:31.923
“G”-- Oh, no,
that's not gonna work.

13:33.794 --> 13:35.093
Geology?

13:35.095 --> 13:37.595
Yes. But we parted ways

13:37.597 --> 13:40.398
because I was worried
about my reputation.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.701
Sheldon, you've never
cared what people thought,

13:43.703 --> 13:47.105
even when you really,
really should.

13:48.842 --> 13:51.142
That dinner with my
parents comes to mind.

13:51.144 --> 13:54.245
If I'm not gonna use
“your momma” jokes

13:54.247 --> 13:57.949
when I meet your mother,
why'd I bother to learn them?

13:59.753 --> 14:03.588
I'm just saying, if you think
the work is interesting,

14:03.590 --> 14:05.590
nothing else
should matter.

14:05.592 --> 14:08.726
You're right, Amy.

14:08.728 --> 14:10.862
That is sage advice.

14:10.864 --> 14:13.731
Which is surprising, considering
your momma is so dumb, she...

14:13.733 --> 14:15.533
Nope.

14:18.338 --> 14:20.872
She studied for a urine test.

14:25.912 --> 14:28.813
I was supposed to go back
to India and get married,

14:28.815 --> 14:30.548
but I realized
it wasn't what I wanted.

14:30.550 --> 14:33.117
So I called off the engagement
and moved out here.

14:33.119 --> 14:35.787
Well, if he wasn't your soul
mate, he wasn't your soul mate.

14:35.789 --> 14:39.324
Oh, God, please tell me
you're not one of those.

14:39.326 --> 14:40.925
One of whats?

14:40.927 --> 14:45.997
I want to say teenage girls,
but that sounds mean.

14:45.999 --> 14:48.700
Come on, you don't believe that
everyone has one perfect match?

14:48.702 --> 14:51.302
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.437
I mean, what if

14:52.439 --> 14:54.105
your soul mate lived
halfway across the world?

14:54.107 --> 14:55.240
You'd never meet.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.174
Yes, you would.

14:56.176 --> 14:57.575
I can give you,
like, 20 examples

14:57.577 --> 14:59.177
where that happened
to Kate Hudson alone.

14:59.179 --> 15:01.179
You know what?

15:01.181 --> 15:03.281
People get upset
when I talk about this.

15:03.283 --> 15:04.482
Let's just change the subject.

15:04.484 --> 15:06.184
No, no, no.
No, it's-it's fine.

15:06.186 --> 15:10.188
Are you saying that you don't
believe two people fall in love?

15:10.190 --> 15:11.256
Of course they do.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.924
It's just that
what people call “love”

15:12.926 --> 15:14.692
is actually a series
of biochemical reactions

15:14.694 --> 15:18.096
in the brain
that fade over time.

15:18.098 --> 15:20.431
Yes. Like the old song,

15:20.433 --> 15:24.903
“When a man has a biochemical
reaction for a woman.”

15:24.905 --> 15:26.070
Raj, we're scientists.

15:26.072 --> 15:27.739
We don't need to feel threatened

15:27.741 --> 15:29.707
just because we understand
the mechanisms

15:29.709 --> 15:31.476
that give rise
to romantic feelings.

15:31.478 --> 15:34.412
It doesn't take anything away
from the experience.

15:34.414 --> 15:35.847
Yes, it does.

15:35.849 --> 15:37.982
Actually, it takes
everything away from it.

15:37.984 --> 15:39.918
Love isn't
just science.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.853
Okay? It's-it's spiritual.

15:41.855 --> 15:43.488
It's an acknowledgment
of a mystery

15:43.490 --> 15:44.956
that's greater than ourselves.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.692
It's what makes people
write songs and poems,

15:47.694 --> 15:51.930
and what has kept <i>The Bachelor</i>
on TV for 21 magical seasons.

15:51.932 --> 15:55.934
Don't you think the fact that
love is given away as a prize

15:55.936 --> 15:58.369
on a game show slightly
undermines your argument?

15:58.371 --> 16:00.071
Uh, yes.

16:00.073 --> 16:01.606
But I've never
missed an episode,

16:01.608 --> 16:04.409
and I dare science
to explain that.

16:06.947 --> 16:08.880
Bert.

16:08.882 --> 16:10.415
Bert, Bert.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.383
Bert, Bert, Bert.

16:12.385 --> 16:14.986
What do you want, Sheldon?

16:14.988 --> 16:17.522
I would like us to
work together again.

16:17.524 --> 16:20.992
I promise to keep my
geology comments to myself,

16:20.994 --> 16:24.829
because while some of them are
funny, all of them are mean.

16:26.466 --> 16:29.167
Well, this is awkward.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.674
Leonard, what are you
doing here?

16:36.676 --> 16:38.109
Bert asked for my help.

16:38.111 --> 16:39.143
BERT: Yeah,
he's an excellent scientist,

16:39.145 --> 16:40.645
and he doesn't tell me

16:40.647 --> 16:43.715
what time I can
go to the bathroom.

16:43.717 --> 16:46.250
It's called bladder training.

16:46.252 --> 16:48.720
When you're in your 80s,
you'll thank me for it.

16:48.722 --> 16:51.389
Look, Sheldon,
you were a jerk to Bert,

16:51.391 --> 16:52.857
and he walked
away from you.

16:52.859 --> 16:56.761
So I feel like there's
a lot he could teach me.

16:56.763 --> 16:59.030
Bert, please. (stammers)

16:59.032 --> 17:00.999
I know I behaved poorly
in the past,

17:01.001 --> 17:02.867
but things will be
different this time.

17:02.869 --> 17:04.202
You'll see.

17:04.204 --> 17:07.438
Come on, let me in.

17:08.675 --> 17:10.340
We'll have some laughs,

17:10.343 --> 17:13.243
we'll calculate
some isotope ratios.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.683
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

17:22.454 --> 17:24.188
So you just shut the door
in his face?

17:24.190 --> 17:26.190
I got to start
writing this stuff down.

17:28.828 --> 17:30.995
I mean, Ruchi's nice.

17:30.997 --> 17:32.163
We're just so different.

17:32.165 --> 17:33.631
I know.
Sometimes when you're dating,

17:33.633 --> 17:34.832
you meet weird people.

17:34.834 --> 17:37.168
I once met a girl
who didn't like juggling.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.971
And she still doesn't.

17:41.641 --> 17:44.008
So you're not gonna
see her again?

17:44.010 --> 17:45.209
What's the point?

17:45.211 --> 17:47.111
We're never gonna be
in a real relationship.

17:47.113 --> 17:48.913
Right, so you'll only be
in a physical one?

17:48.915 --> 17:50.148
Exactly.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.250
Why would I want to spend time
with someone like that?

17:52.252 --> 17:54.852
Someone who is
just interested in sex?

17:54.854 --> 17:57.422
Yeah.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.323
Raj, do you real...
Whoa, hold on.

17:59.325 --> 18:02.226
Give him a chance.
He's gonna get this.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.563
I don't think he is.

18:06.900 --> 18:07.899
What is there to get?

18:07.901 --> 18:09.167
She doesn't want
to fall in love.

18:09.169 --> 18:10.168
At that point,

18:10.170 --> 18:11.669
all we are is two single people

18:11.671 --> 18:13.371
who find each other attractive
and enjoy having--

18:13.373 --> 18:14.572
Oh, got to go!

18:19.078 --> 18:20.778
So how was
your night with Ruchi?

18:20.780 --> 18:21.912
Oh, great.

18:21.914 --> 18:24.281
We ordered in some food,
we had sex, I left.

18:24.283 --> 18:26.517
I didn't even ask
if she enjoyed it.

18:26.519 --> 18:28.019
(chuckles)

18:28.021 --> 18:30.855
I can field that one for her.

18:30.857 --> 18:33.891
I mean, I did get a little misty
when we said good-bye,

18:33.893 --> 18:35.493
but I played it off
as allergies.

18:35.495 --> 18:37.061
I don't know if she bought it.

18:37.063 --> 18:39.030
Again, I know.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.767
Sheldon?

18:42.769 --> 18:44.101
You okay?

18:44.103 --> 18:45.369
