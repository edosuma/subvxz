00:03.421 --> 00:06.413
( record playing )

00:11.679 --> 00:16.719
- J‘ Maybe... J‘
- ( girl laughing)

00:16.893 --> 00:21.011
J‘ You'll think of me J‘

00:22.315 --> 00:28.936
J‘ When you are all alone... J‘

00:31.324 --> 00:32.780
Griselda.

00:32.950 --> 00:36.067
- ( walker snarling )
- J‘ Maybe the one J‘

00:36.245 --> 00:40.079
- J‘ Who is waiting... J‘
-( kettle whistling )

00:40.249 --> 00:43.241
J‘ For you J‘

00:43.419 --> 00:47.753
J‘ Will prove untrue J‘

00:47.924 --> 00:52.793
J‘ Then what will you do? J‘

00:52.970 --> 00:54.961
(theme music playing )

01:31.509 --> 01:33.500
( crickets chirping )

01:46.983 --> 01:49.190
You can sleep, Lizzie.
I'm okay.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.396
If there's trouble,
I can take Judith.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.231
I can help.

01:53.406 --> 01:55.692
You really think
you can help me?

01:55.866 --> 01:57.857
I know I can, ma'am.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.290
Do you think there'll
be kids there?

02:06.460 --> 02:08.576
At Terminus?

02:08.754 --> 02:11.040
If their parents
kept them safe.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.376
Like Tyreese kept
all of you safe.

02:13.551 --> 02:16.384
I saved Tyreese.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.886
There were people
shooting at him.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.047
I shot them.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.351
First a man,
then a woman.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.225
I didn't mean
to shoot her in the head.

02:32.403 --> 02:34.394
You had to.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.647
You saved Tyreese.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.235
Maybe there'll
be kids there,

02:42.413 --> 02:45.075
even if their parents
couldn't keep them safe.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.581
Maybe the kids kept
their parents safe.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.788
Yeah.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.421
Did you have kids?

02:54.592 --> 02:56.332
Idid.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.091
A kid.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.048
A daughter.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.837
What was she like?

03:03.768 --> 03:05.759
She was sweet.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.101
She didn't have
a mean bone in her body.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.230
Is that why
she isn't here now?

03:17.114 --> 03:19.105
Yeah.

03:22.286 --> 03:25.073
Do you miss her?

03:25.247 --> 03:27.283
Every day.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.163
Would you miss me?

03:34.590 --> 03:36.672
I'm not gonna
have to miss you.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.384
You're dead on your feet.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.885
Go sleep next
to your sister, okay?

03:42.056 --> 03:43.387
But, ma'am,
I can help.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.516
Go to sleep, okay?

03:56.654 --> 03:58.519
Go.

04:03.327 --> 04:05.158
No.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.074
( grunts )
No.

04:08.249 --> 04:11.036
(Tyreese murmuring)

04:11.210 --> 04:13.576
No, no.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.540
No, no. No.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.132
Found some.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.048
There you go.
Good job.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.023
Ow.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.485
- It hurts, right?
- Oh, yeah. It hurts.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.025
This will fight
the infection.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.285
Might even bring
down your fever.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.662
What do you think?

04:53.836 --> 04:56.873
Three days out?
Fourdays?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.538
We haven't seen any of those maps
at the crossings.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.673
I'm not sure.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.803
Lizzie's tough.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.049
When it comes
to people.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.388
What do you mean?

05:12.563 --> 05:15.475
You haven't seen it?

05:15.649 --> 05:18.857
How she's confused
about them, the walkers.

05:19.028 --> 05:21.269
She doesn't see
what they are.

05:21.447 --> 05:23.733
She thinks
they're just different.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.622
Tyreese:
Mica the same way?

05:33.792 --> 05:35.748
No, she's worse.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.128
She doesn't have
a mean bone in her body.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.587
Mica:
Did "Tom Sawyer" have a happy ending?

05:44.762 --> 05:47.094
We never
got to finish it.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.926
Well, Tom and Huck,

05:50.100 --> 05:52.591
they stop lnjun Joe
and his partner

05:52.770 --> 05:54.556
and wind up
getting all his gold.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.937
- So they wind up rich?
- Mm-hmm.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.234
And the Widow Douglas
adopts Huck.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.902
Like you adopted us?

06:01.070 --> 06:03.903
Yeah, I'm just like
the Widow Douglas.

06:04.073 --> 06:06.280
And I'm Huck Finn.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.157
I think you're more
like Tom Sawyer.

06:09.328 --> 06:11.444
Yeah, you're right.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.408
You're way more
like Huck Finn.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.244
You're not even grossed out
by dead rabbits.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.830
Forgot you used
to read to them.

06:20.798 --> 06:22.379
Idid.

06:24.969 --> 06:27.836
Terminus.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.220
Terminus.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.474
(giggles)
Terminus.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.760
I am a robot.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.055
Come live with me
at Terminus

06:39.233 --> 06:41.895
where we have
robot parties

06:42.069 --> 06:44.902
and dance
with our robot friends.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.233
Terminus.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.275
(laughing)

06:57.543 --> 06:59.750
(snarling )

07:03.757 --> 07:06.294
Lizzie, don't.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.845
- What?
- Eyes forward.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.190
- You smell that?
- Yeah.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.521
There's a fire somewhere.

07:25.696 --> 07:28.563
Must be a big one.
It isn't anywhere around here.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.867
We should stop here.
We need to look for water.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.029
I can do it.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.993
No, you need to rest.
Rest your arm.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.033
Mica will help me.

07:48.302 --> 07:51.385
l spy trees and weeds.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.546
Yourturn.

08:03.359 --> 08:06.271
Here.
You stay here.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.678
(snarling )

08:52.282 --> 08:54.238
Ty reese.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.199
Sometimes we have
to kill them.

08:59.373 --> 09:02.331
I know that.
But sometimes we don't.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.833
(Judith crying)

09:05.003 --> 09:08.131
(growling)

09:08.298 --> 09:11.540
You know Lizzie can carry
a lot more than me.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.631
I had you come because
I wanted to talk to you.

09:14.805 --> 09:16.136
Why?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.046
Because you're little
and you're sweet

09:18.225 --> 09:20.682
and those are two things
that can get you killed.

09:20.853 --> 09:23.094
You can't change
how big you are...

09:23.272 --> 09:24.978
| wish I could.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.639
...but you can
toughen up.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.149
I don't have
to be tough.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.810
I can run.
I'm good at that.

09:31.989 --> 09:34.071
No.

09:34.241 --> 09:38.359
My daughter ran
and it wasn't enough.

09:40.831 --> 09:43.413
That's why I taught the kids
at the prison to do more than that.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.700
I can kill walkers.

09:45.878 --> 09:47.869
I mean, I've tried.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.248
I'm not like my sister.
I'm not messed up.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.712
I know what they are.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.094
But I can't kill people.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.845
I could never do that.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.600
When the bad people
were at the prison,

10:03.771 --> 10:05.602
they were right
in front of us

10:05.773 --> 10:08.264
and I held up my gun,

10:08.442 --> 10:10.478
but I couldn't
pthhetﬁggen

10:10.652 --> 10:13.860
Killing people is wrong.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.272
Someone killed
Karen and David.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.192
They just killed them.
They were nice.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.200
What about people
who try to kill you?

10:21.371 --> 10:24.238
I don't even
wish I could.

10:26.919 --> 10:31.162
People came in
and killed our friends.

10:31.340 --> 10:34.298
And | feel sorry
for them.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.709
Why?

10:36.887 --> 10:40.175
Because they probably
weren't like that before.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.761
Sooner or later
you're gonna have to do it.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.142
You'll have to do it
or you'll die.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.473
So you're gonna change
the way you think about it.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.764
You have to change.
Everyone does now.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.682
Things don't
just work out.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.566
Look.

11:04.039 --> 11:08.578
My mom used to say everything
works out the way it's supposed to.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.721
Mica:
What are these?

11:26.895 --> 11:30.137
- Carol: Pecans.
- Oh, I love pecans.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.897
You know, maybe we could
catch our breath here for a while.

11:37.781 --> 11:39.692
We're still going
to Terminus, right?

11:39.867 --> 11:42.449
We'll just stay
a day or two.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.450
There's a well
full of water.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
Fences.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.655
They're not big,
but they're something.

11:47.833 --> 11:49.414
And we saw deer.
They eat pecans.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.041
We should be able
to kill one to eat.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.826
We can eat these,
too, right?

11:53.005 --> 11:54.336
You can eat your fill
and then some.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.586
Look.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.464
Bet that's what
we were smelling.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.094
Looks far enough away.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.426
I wonder
how it started.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.434
Maybe lightning.
Maybe a campfire.

12:08.604 --> 12:10.094
I can patch that fence.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.012
It's probably where
the deer are coming from.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.853
We should leave it.
Just play it really safe in here.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.768
( knocking )

12:20.449 --> 12:23.566
If there's one in there,
it's not moving much.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.827
Let's just stay close,
go slow room to room.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.783
Girls, you sit tight.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.994
You don't come in until we come out
no matter what you hear.

12:32.169 --> 12:33.454
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.166
Lizzie's got Judith.
Mica, get out your gun.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.376
You're gonna need
to stand watch.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.338
Stand strong,
little lady.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.764
They're gonna be okay.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.854
It's not that.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.031
Is it that
there was a baby?

13:05.202 --> 13:06.817
No.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.451
They're gonna find one in there
and they're going--

13:11.625 --> 13:13.161
Stop it.
They aren't people.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.327
But you're wrong.
All of you.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.791
They aren't people, Lizzie.
They're just dead.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.207
- ( snarling)
- ( girls gasp)

13:23.887 --> 13:26.003
(Judith crying)

13:28.767 --> 13:31.099
(gunshot)

13:31.269 --> 13:34.511
(screaming )
Stop! Stop! Stop!

13:35.816 --> 13:38.102
(Judith crying)

13:40.404 --> 13:42.110
- Are you okay?
-( hyperventilating )

13:42.280 --> 13:45.568
All right, come on.
Come on.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.233
Tyreese: Come on, come on.
I got you, little girl.

13:48.412 --> 13:49.948
- Come on. Come here.
- Got her? Mica.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.238
Mica, lower the gun.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.408
You did it.
You saved them.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.082
Why are you upset, Lizzie?
Were you scared?

14:00.257 --> 14:02.248
No.

14:02.426 --> 14:05.088
Then why
are you crying?

14:05.262 --> 14:07.423
I don't want to say.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.345
- I want to bury him.
- We can burn him.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.760
This is probably
his house.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.271
If we're gonna use it,
we should do the right thing.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.933
He should be
with his family.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.611
Fine, you can
bury him yourself.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.158
No help from me,
no help from Tyreese.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.778
I think you're
gonna help me.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.448
(Judith crying)

14:38.754 --> 14:40.460
Lizzie.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.042
I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

14:43.216 --> 14:47.004
Just look at the flowers
like you're supposed to.

14:47.179 --> 14:48.419
Count one, two, three.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.303
Come on,
let's count together.

14:50.474 --> 14:52.135
Look at the pink ones
over there. You see?

14:52.309 --> 14:54.766
Both:
One, two, three.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.149
We got peaches,
oatmeal, baby food.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.365
There's a crib,
baby clothes, toys.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.656
And look.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.496
Gas.
Can you believe this?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.164
Everything always works out
like it's supposed to.

15:48.657 --> 15:50.488
Take a break.

15:50.659 --> 15:52.149
Thanks.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.383
How are you gonna
get the body over here?

16:10.554 --> 16:13.216
You're gonna help me.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.934
( cracks )

16:27.487 --> 16:29.478
You still upset?

16:32.117 --> 16:34.403
Sometimes
I don't understand,

16:34.578 --> 16:36.409
but I'm trying to, ma'am.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.536
lam.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.414
Look what I found.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.497
I'm gonna name her
Griselda Gunderson.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.461
Well, we got
plenty of water.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.718
Now all we got to do is bag
one of them deer and we're all set.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.301
- Then we'll get one.
- Yeah.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.186
- What's wrong?
- I'm not used to this.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.858
Used to what?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.735
We're in a living room
in a house.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.106
Yeah, so relax.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.304
We should live here.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.985
( pecans crack )

18:10.382 --> 18:12.998
( Lizzie laughing )

18:13.176 --> 18:15.883
Griselda.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.591
-( laughing )
- Lizzie.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.630
Come on.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.674
(snarling )

18:22.852 --> 18:24.763
- You get away from it!
- No, no, no!

18:24.938 --> 18:26.894
- Right now, Lizzie.
- No, no, no, no, no.

18:27.065 --> 18:29.602
- No, no, no, no.
- Lizzie! Lizzie!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.607
No! No!

18:33.989 --> 18:36.480
She was playing with me.
She wanted a friend.

18:36.658 --> 18:37.989
She wanted to kill you.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.821
- l was gonna lead her away.
- You could have died.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.657
It's the same thing!
You killed her!

18:42.831 --> 18:45.664
- You killed her! It's the same thing!
- Lizzie.

18:45.834 --> 18:48.041
What if I killed you?!
What if I killed you?!

18:48.211 --> 18:51.453
Lizzie. Lizzie.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.667
You don't understand.
You don't understand.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.833
You don't understand.
You don't understand!

18:56.011 --> 18:58.218
Lizzie. Lizzie.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.504
( gasps )
You didn't have to.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.593
You didn't have to.
She didn't want to hurt any...

19:02.767 --> 19:04.803
( kettle whistling )

19:06.021 --> 19:08.182
She didn't want
to hurt anybody!

19:08.356 --> 19:10.597
She was my friend
and you killed her!

19:11.693 --> 19:12.853
You killed her!

19:13.028 --> 19:15.360
You killed her!

19:17.032 --> 19:19.068
She was my friend.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.779
(crying)

19:57.530 --> 19:59.066
Carol:
Is it too heavy?

19:59.240 --> 20:02.027
Nah, I'm good.

20:04.913 --> 20:07.279
The fire's
still burning.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.163
Carol:
It could have gone out.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.450
Nope.
The smoke's black.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.495
If it was white, the fire wouldn't
be burning anymore.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.165
I miss science class.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.459
Except for when
we had to do stuff like

20:20.637 --> 20:23.470
cut up planaria worms.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.507
You've got to do worse
than that nowadays, Mica.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.471
- I don't gotta.
- You do.

20:29.646 --> 20:32.308
Lizzie's bigger than you
and in some ways she's stronger.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.768
But you're smarter

20:34.943 --> 20:37.935
and you understand
these... things.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.690
You've got to
look out for her.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.446
You have to--

20:47.163 --> 20:48.994
No, go ahead.
You do it.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.451
Just like I showed you at the prison.
Go ahead.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.560
I can't.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.066
We have peaches.

21:37.797 --> 21:41.039
You think
I'm too hard on them?

21:42.427 --> 21:45.260
No. | get it.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.803
One of them
can't kill walkers

21:50.977 --> 21:53.593
and the other one
can't hurt a living thing.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.309
They're both gonna have
to do both sooner or later.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.063
l have to get them there
before we get to Terminus.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.575
Maybe we don't need
to go to Terminus.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.791
I've been thinking.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.751
Mica's right.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.042
We can stay here.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.802
We can live here.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.591
I know Lizzie and Mica.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.103
I know Judith.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.138
I know you.

22:39.317 --> 22:41.399
I trust you.

22:41.569 --> 22:44.026
And I don't know
if I can get that anywhere else.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.818
We could stay.

22:47.992 --> 22:50.608
We can live here.

22:58.795 --> 23:00.751
Lizzie?

23:02.090 --> 23:03.626
Lizzie?

23:10.306 --> 23:11.967
(walker snarling )

23:12.141 --> 23:14.518
(squeaking )

23:23.695 --> 23:25.526
Don't worry.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.312
I'll get you more.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.105
Mica:
Lizzie.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.579
When we were giving
them names,

23:33.746 --> 23:35.998
we were just pretending
things weren't bad.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.905
Things are bad.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.996
Those things, they're bad.
They are.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.582
We can't pretend anymore.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.169
I'm not pretending.
You were.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.676
I know.
I can hear them.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.838
(growling)

23:54.851 --> 23:57.593
They want to kill you.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.352
They just want me
to change.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.060
To make me be like them.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.475
Maybe I should change.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.359
(growling)

24:07.530 --> 24:08.815
Stop it.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.197
I can make you
all understand.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.528
- Lizzie.
-( leaves rustling )

24:13.703 --> 24:15.864
( girls gasp )

24:17.415 --> 24:20.498
Lizzie, they're coming.
Lizzie!

24:28.760 --> 24:30.375
Carol!

24:36.392 --> 24:38.804
(girls screaming )

24:39.979 --> 24:41.890
(screaming )
Help!

24:42.065 --> 24:44.556
Help, Carol!
Lizzie!

24:44.734 --> 24:46.565
- Lizzie!
- Mica!

24:46.736 --> 24:48.727
- Mica!
- Lizzie!

24:48.905 --> 24:51.146
- Let me go! Help me!
- ( gunshot)

24:51.324 --> 24:54.236
- ( Mica screams) Help!
- Get behind us!

25:30.029 --> 25:31.815
It's okay.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.701
You did it.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.803
I had to help stop them.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.600
Do you understand
what they are now?

26:05.815 --> 26:08.352
I know--

26:08.526 --> 26:10.892
I know what I have
to do now.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.776
I know.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.190
lt's ugly
and it's scary

26:17.368 --> 26:19.575
and it does change you.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.325
That's how
we get to be here.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.367
That's the cost.
That's growing up now.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.204
Mica:
I don't want to hurt anyone.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.007
I don't want
to be mean.

26:35.178 --> 26:38.011
You have to be sometimes.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.263
But just sometimes.

26:43.186 --> 26:46.178
No. No.

26:48.649 --> 26:51.561
Now we have a lot
of pecans here.

26:51.736 --> 26:53.317
Aton.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.854
- You getting sick of them yet?
- Nope.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.528
( laughs)

27:00.703 --> 27:03.240
| used to make these
with my grandma when l was little.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.405
They smell good.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.658
There you go.
All right.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.703
I think you guys are ready to start
doing the cooking around here.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.837
Who wants to put 'em in?

27:14.008 --> 27:16.374
Me.

27:19.639 --> 27:22.221
The girls like it here.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.803
We could build it up,
plant more food.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.060
We could find a car
for an escape route just in case.

27:32.693 --> 27:35.685
If you don't want to go to Terminus,
we could stay.

27:39.283 --> 27:41.399
We could.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.492
It doesn't mean
we can't go someday.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.410
It's just...

27:54.215 --> 27:55.876
when we were getting
closer and closer,

27:56.050 --> 27:58.132
lreaHzed

27:58.302 --> 28:01.590
I'm just not ready to be
around other people yet.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.755
You don't have to.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.733
I dream about Karen.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.071
| see her every night.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.109
And every time
I forget she's dead.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.623
Sometimes...

28:33.462 --> 28:35.874
we just talk.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.459
And sometimes

28:40.636 --> 28:42.752
| see her in the crowd...

28:45.725 --> 28:47.966
in a city
I've never been to.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.387
And it's back before
everything happened.

28:58.154 --> 29:00.110
And then...

29:01.449 --> 29:04.941
some nights,
the bad ones...

29:06.829 --> 29:09.241
| see someone kill her.

29:12.001 --> 29:16.620
Some stranger.

29:20.843 --> 29:24.176
Then I lose her
all over again.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.848
But that's the deal, right?

29:34.023 --> 29:36.685
The people who are living
are haunted by the dead.

29:38.778 --> 29:41.360
We are who we are.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.862
And we do what we do

29:44.033 --> 29:46.445
'cause they're still here.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.202
In our heads.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.284
In the forest.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.999
The whole world
is haunted now.

29:57.713 --> 30:00.329
And there's no
getting out of that.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.795
Not until we're dead.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.345
Ty reese.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.941
Maybe they're not
haunting us.

30:27.410 --> 30:32.074
Maybe they're
just teaching us.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.411
Helping remind us so--

30:38.504 --> 30:41.746
so that we can live
with what we have to do.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.381
Hey.

30:53.686 --> 30:56.849
Don't you ever be ashamed
of who you are, Carol.

30:58.441 --> 31:01.353
You did right
by those girls.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.735
You did right
by everyone.

31:19.170 --> 31:21.377
We'll get one yet.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.879
Probably not even
deerseason.

31:26.844 --> 31:29.426
My husband
used to hunt.

31:29.597 --> 31:33.260
He'd tell the same
stupid joke every year.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.638
You gonna tell it?

31:36.812 --> 31:38.973
Well, I guess
I have to now, right?

31:39.148 --> 31:40.888
You do.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.183
Okay.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.319
What's the difference between
beer nuts and deer nuts?

31:49.450 --> 31:52.658
Beer nuts
are around 1.79,

31:52.828 --> 31:54.864
deer nuts are just
under a buck.

31:55.039 --> 31:58.156
( laughs )
That's good stupid,

31:58.334 --> 32:00.575
but in no way
is it stupid good.

32:00.753 --> 32:04.120
Yeah, I told you.
There's more where that came from.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.467
Don't worry.
She'll come back.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.386
I didn't hurt her brain.

32:44.672 --> 32:47.163
No, no, no!
We have to wait.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.706
I need to show you.
You'll see.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.876
You'll finally get it.
We have to wait.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.589
Lizzie,
put the gun down.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.974
| just want us to wait.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.227
We can wait.

33:01.397 --> 33:04.355
We can wait.
You just give me the gun.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.565
We can wait, I swear.

33:16.829 --> 33:20.321
You and Tyreese
should take Judith back.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.660
It's not safe for her.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.076
But Judith can change, too.

33:25.254 --> 33:28.337
- l was just about to--
- She can't even walk yet.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.178
Yeah, you're right.

33:36.557 --> 33:38.673
So you two take Judith
back to the house

33:38.851 --> 33:41.183
and we'll have lunch.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.140
And I'll just tie Mica up.

33:44.315 --> 33:46.476
You know, just so
she won't go anywhere.

33:46.650 --> 33:49.141
Promise that's
what you'll do?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.276
Mm-hmm.

33:51.447 --> 33:53.438
I promise.

33:53.616 --> 33:56.198
I'll use
her shoelaces.

34:05.461 --> 34:09.545
(Judith crying)

34:16.847 --> 34:19.884
Let's--
let's go, Lizzie.

34:37.785 --> 34:40.492
(crying)

35:02.309 --> 35:04.391
I brought her
some food.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.432
Cleared out her room.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.644
Made sure she didn't
have any knives,

35:11.819 --> 35:13.810
anything like that.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.952
She has a shoe box
full of mice.

35:26.125 --> 35:29.538
| asked her if she was the one
feeding the walkers at the prison.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.203
That was her.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.718
And at the tombs,

35:39.888 --> 35:42.630
we found this rabbit

35:42.808 --> 35:46.141
pulled apart and nailed
to a board.

35:47.688 --> 35:49.804
That was her, too.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.557
Said she was
just having fun.

35:59.283 --> 36:01.114
lwas thinking,

36:01.285 --> 36:04.869
maybe she killed
Karen and David.

36:05.039 --> 36:08.202
But I don't know how
she could drag them away.

36:09.543 --> 36:12.410
She would have
let them turn.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.579
It wasn't her.

36:20.888 --> 36:23.174
So what do we do?

36:23.349 --> 36:25.761
I could leave with her.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.515
What?

36:29.438 --> 36:32.020
We can't sleep with her and Judith
under the same roof.

36:32.191 --> 36:35.934
You wouldn't make it.
Not on your own.

36:36.111 --> 36:39.103
She can't be around
other people.

36:39.281 --> 36:42.318
Maybe we could try
to help her.

36:42.493 --> 36:44.700
Talk her back somehow.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.202
This is how she is.

36:49.124 --> 36:51.456
It was already there.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.168
I didn't see it.

36:55.339 --> 36:58.046
- How could you?
- I should have seen it.

37:03.180 --> 37:05.466
So maybe we go.

37:05.641 --> 37:07.381
Me and Judith.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.550
You won't make it either.

37:15.109 --> 37:17.771
She can't be around
other people.

37:41.802 --> 37:44.885
You should pick
some wildflowers for Mica

37:45.055 --> 37:47.467
to give her
when she comes back.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.973
Yeah, she'd love that.

37:57.484 --> 37:59.975
The fire's still burning.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.236
No.

38:02.406 --> 38:03.987
The smoke's white.

38:04.158 --> 38:05.898
It's out.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.785
You know
everything, ma'am.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.446
No, I don't.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.998
What is it?

38:17.671 --> 38:19.707
What is it?

38:22.050 --> 38:24.541
Are you mad at me?

38:24.720 --> 38:27.712
Is that what you wanted
to talk to me about?

38:30.225 --> 38:33.092
I'm sorry I pointed
my gun at you.

38:33.270 --> 38:35.727
ljust needed you
to wait.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.015
I know.

38:41.904 --> 38:43.895
I'm sorry.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.696
You're mad at me.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.409
I love you, Lizzie.

38:51.580 --> 38:54.697
(crying)

38:54.875 --> 38:58.083
And everything works out
the way it's supposed to.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.582
I'm sorry.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.998
Please don't be
mad at me.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.258
I'm sorry.

39:06.428 --> 39:09.465
You just-- just look
at the flowers, Lizzie.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.256
(crying)

39:15.646 --> 39:18.308
Just look
at the flowers.

39:25.364 --> 39:29.198
Just-- just look
at the flowers.

39:40.546 --> 39:43.288
(gunshot)

41:29.821 --> 41:32.153
I killed Karen
and David.

41:36.995 --> 41:39.236
I had to stop the illness
from breaking out.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.905
I had to stop
other people from dying.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.580
It wasn't Lizzie.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.549
It wasn't a stranger.

41:57.599 --> 42:00.306
Tyreese, it was me.

42:08.151 --> 42:10.267
You do what
you have to do.

42:26.336 --> 42:28.952
Did she know
what was happening?

42:31.633 --> 42:33.624
Was she scared?

42:44.020 --> 42:46.011
It was quick?

42:48.191 --> 42:50.352
Yes.

43:07.002 --> 43:09.334
Do what you have to do.

43:30.859 --> 43:32.850
I forgive you.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.564
I'm never gonna forget.

43:40.368 --> 43:42.529
lthappened.

43:42.704 --> 43:45.116
You did it.

43:45.290 --> 43:47.747
You feel it.

43:47.918 --> 43:50.204
I know you do.

43:51.546 --> 43:53.537
It's a part of you now.

43:55.425 --> 43:57.290
Me, too.

44:01.598 --> 44:05.216
But I forgive you.

44:11.942 --> 44:14.149
Thank you.

44:19.783 --> 44:22.024
We don't need to stay.

44:26.039 --> 44:28.246
We can't stay.

44:54.109 --> 44:57.772
Lizzie's voice:
I'm not afraid to kill.

44:57.946 --> 45:00.528
I'm just afraid.

45:02.284 --> 45:04.240
Carol's voice:
You can't be.

45:04.411 --> 45:06.493
Lizzie's voice:
How?

45:06.663 --> 45:08.949
Carol's voice:
You fight...

45:09.124 --> 45:11.115
and fight it.

45:12.127 --> 45:14.118
You don't give up.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.913
And then one day,

45:18.091 --> 45:21.083
you just change.

45:25.307 --> 45:27.673
We all change.

45:49.497 --> 45:52.489
