-[laughs] Mariner,

08:59.756 --> 09:01.845

to judge the menagerie.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.673
We're just here
to collect the humans.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.066
No, you're here
to collect humans.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.111

in my head.

Moopsy.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.656
And I can't wait until we're
the same rank again because then

people behind their backs.

yourself to get a promotion

Of course, Mr. Rutherford.
What's up?

09:47.804 --> 09:49.197
For the past year,
I've been working

09:49.240 --> 09:50.938
to decrease vibration
in the warp manifold

09:50.981 --> 09:53.201
by a factor of .05.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.116
.05? That can't be right.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.640
Well, it wasn't easy, but with
a little ingenuity... [chuckles]

09:57.684 --> 09:58.946
BILLUPS:
No, I mean it can't be right

09:58.989 --> 10:00.904
because, a few minutes ago,
Ensign Livik

10:00.948 --> 10:03.646
decreased the vibration
by a factor of .06.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.082
Ensign Livik? Who's that?

10:05.126 --> 10:06.344
-The new guy.
-[whooping, cheering]

10:06.388 --> 10:07.911
[chanting]:
Livik! Livik!

10:07.955 --> 10:09.521
Livik! Livik!

10:09.565 --> 10:10.697
Livik.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.742
[groaning]

10:17.225 --> 10:19.836
Ha! Stupid bussard light.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.316
You ain't so tough now.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.926
I'll tell you,
if Livik keeps this up,

10:22.970 --> 10:24.232
he'll have a promotion
in no time.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.537
Let's fire up
his protocol right now.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.844
I want to see
that .06 in action.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.064
[screaming]

10:31.326 --> 10:32.806
Help.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.115
And right this way.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.030
Hello, humans.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.554
Narj hopes you have enjoyed
your stay in the "menage."

10:42.598 --> 10:45.775
Now, it is time for you to
return to your natural habitat.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.734
I know you're taking a hit
losing these guys.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.126
We appreciate
the positive attitude.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.781
Not to worry.
My real moneymakers

10:51.825 --> 10:53.914
are the Pyrithian
Swamp Gobblers over there.

10:53.957 --> 10:56.046
[roars]

10:56.090 --> 10:57.526
[whines]

10:57.569 --> 10:58.875
Moopsy.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.224
Hm?

11:00.268 --> 11:01.965
Oh, [bleep]!
The Moopsy is free!

11:02.009 --> 11:03.967
Oh, no, your cuddliest
prisoner is loose.

11:04.011 --> 11:05.360
Whatever shall we do?

11:05.403 --> 11:06.970
NARJ:
You don't understand.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.580
Everything here
is incredibly dangerous.

11:08.624 --> 11:09.930
MOOPSY:
Moopsy.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.540
RANSOM: Can't be worse
than the Swamp Gobblers.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.456
Of course it's worse!
They only gobble you.

11:14.499 --> 11:16.197
The Moopsy drinks your bones!

11:16.240 --> 11:17.938
How does something drink bones?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.680
[roars]

11:21.681 --> 11:22.899
Holy [bleep]!

11:22.943 --> 11:24.596
NARJ:
Run! Run for your lives!

11:24.640 --> 11:27.295
[others screaming]

11:30.428 --> 11:32.430
[fussing]

11:32.474 --> 11:34.302
Moopsy.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.347
RUTHERFORD:
Come on, come on, come on,
show me that sweet

11:36.391 --> 11:37.914
incremental improvement.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.220
Yes!

11:39.263 --> 11:41.265
Commander Billups?
You might want to sit down.

11:41.309 --> 11:43.006
I increased the power output

11:43.050 --> 11:45.661
of the Tucker Tubes
by seven pico-cochrans.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.271
That's great, Rutherford.

11:47.315 --> 11:49.273
I just hope those adjustments
can apply to the Billups Tubes.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.361
The what now?

11:50.405 --> 11:52.320
Ensign Livik figured out
how to add

11:52.363 --> 11:54.975
a third tube without triggering
a Heisenberg collapse.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.193
A third tube?

11:56.237 --> 11:58.979
Yeah, and he named it
the Billups Tubes.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.545
[laughs] Classic Livik.

12:00.589 --> 12:01.982
-I-I don't even know
what we use these for,
-[grunts]

12:02.025 --> 12:02.939
but I love them.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.811
-GROUP [chanting]: Livik! Livik!
-Livik.

12:06.116 --> 12:09.598
Wow, so close to the holodecks.
This is gonna be awesome.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.862
[sighs] That's more like it.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.951
Thanks for helping me
get my new quarters, sir.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.605
Happy to help, baby bear.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.129
Well, have fun getting
settled in. I've got to run.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.697
Dr. T'Ana and I have a date
on the holodeck.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.133
Have fun.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.483
You ready to get disgusting?

12:25.527 --> 12:28.182
Has that ever
stopped you before?

12:31.228 --> 12:33.491
T'ANA:
Computer, activate
T'Ana program 35.

12:33.535 --> 12:36.973
Uh, how thin are these walls?

12:37.017 --> 12:38.192
ROBIN HOOD:
With me, my merry men.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.933
We must make haste to the castle

12:39.976 --> 12:41.717
to save the Maid Marion.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.458
Ow! What are you doing?

12:43.501 --> 12:46.069
T'ANA:
Shut your [bleep] face.
I'm Robin Hood now.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.593
Toodley doo!
Shaxs, hold him down.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.378
SHAXS:
You've already hurt him
pretty bad.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.815
-T'ANA: Kick his head!
-ROBIN HOOD: Help! A cat

12:52.859 --> 12:56.253
-has stolen my hat and arrows.
-[thumping]

12:56.297 --> 12:58.603
SHAXS:
Can't we just do the program
as intended for once?

12:58.647 --> 13:00.388
T'ANA:
Oh!

13:00.431 --> 13:02.520
-[loud banging]
-[sighs, clears throat]
-[microphone feedback]

13:02.564 --> 13:05.045
FREEMAN:
And now that I am president

13:05.088 --> 13:06.481
-of all Starfleet,
-[groans]

13:06.524 --> 13:08.091
allow me to present

13:08.135 --> 13:10.877
my inaugural scatting.
[scatting]

13:10.920 --> 13:13.618
Why is there a room
between two holodecks?

13:13.662 --> 13:15.229
-T'ANA: Don't make me arrow you!
-[scatting continues]

13:15.272 --> 13:16.491
SHAXS:
Ow! Stop that.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.232
-T'ANA: Make me!
-SHAXS: Ow!

13:18.275 --> 13:20.060
T'ANA:
I steal from the [bleep]
and give to my [bleep]!

13:20.103 --> 13:22.062
[Narj screaming]

13:25.108 --> 13:26.240
[fussing]

13:26.283 --> 13:27.937
Moopsy.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.460
[all panting]

13:29.504 --> 13:30.984
[screams]

13:32.986 --> 13:34.422
[thud]

13:34.465 --> 13:36.728
[grunts]

13:36.772 --> 13:39.731
So much... [gasps]
for these new pants.

13:39.775 --> 13:40.907
MARINER:
Uh, no-weapons policy

13:40.950 --> 13:42.952
in a death-trap zoo?
[bleep] genius.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.999
-What's your problem?
-Do I really have to say it?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.696
Wait, you think
I let that thing out?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.393
You've been pulling
insubordinate crap all day.

13:49.437 --> 13:50.568
Oh, that is rich.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.613
You're the one who let

13:51.656 --> 13:53.223
a bone-eating monster
out of its cage.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.529
Uh, Narj will
make sure the Moopsy

13:54.572 --> 13:56.096
is still attacking the door.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.488
Yeah, I've been pushing
your buttons, because

13:57.532 --> 13:59.316
I knew you were looking
for a reason to demote me,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.057
and of course it's for something
I didn't even do.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.580
Wait, why would I want
to demote you?

14:02.624 --> 14:05.714
Gee, I don't know, how about
our entire working relationship?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.194
What? I'm a good boss.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.065
You stabbed me in the foot
with a battle blade,

14:09.109 --> 14:12.286
you-you turned into a giant head
and tried to eat me,

14:12.329 --> 14:13.722
you tried to trick me
into messing up

14:13.765 --> 14:15.506
-on that space elevator...
-That was an orbital lift.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.813
And then, after you promised
you would believe in me,

14:17.857 --> 14:19.032
I heard you tell Shaxs
in the gym

14:19.075 --> 14:20.903
that I wasn't gonna
be your problem anymore.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.036
W-What? The gym?
You heard that?

14:23.079 --> 14:24.559
Ha! You admit it.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.127
All I meant is that
you're not gonna be my problem

14:27.170 --> 14:29.390
because I'm not gonna take the
bait with your insubordination.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.174
Bait? What-what are you
talking about?

14:31.218 --> 14:32.219
Ugh, it's all in your file.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.003
You've been promoted
a dozen times,

14:34.047 --> 14:36.136
then you always get demoted
for acting out.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.051
-Yeah, 'cause I'm a, you know,
I'm a free spirt.
-No.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.401
Because you're manipulating
your commanding officers.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.403
I'm gonna be the first one
who doesn't fall for it.

14:42.446 --> 14:43.970
Trust me, it's not easy.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.407
[scoffs]
I do not try to get demoted.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.409
What have you
been doing all day?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.411
No. I... I was... You...

14:50.454 --> 14:52.369
Uh... Okay, fine,
that was just today.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.763
-You always do.
-No, I don't. I...

14:54.806 --> 14:57.113
Shut up. [sighs]

14:57.157 --> 14:59.115
-Why would I do that?
-I don't know.

14:59.159 --> 15:02.031
But I'm sorry to say you still
have my unwavering support,

15:02.075 --> 15:03.598
no matter how hard you make it.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.382
[sighs]

15:05.426 --> 15:06.818
I didn't let the Moopsy out.

15:06.862 --> 15:08.559
I believe you.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.518
Okay. Thank you.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.868
I'm glad you two worked
your whole thing out,

15:12.912 --> 15:15.262
but can we maybe focus
on the bone-drinking monster

15:15.305 --> 15:17.307
this plant guy
probably set loose?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.527
You accuse Narj
of Moopsy freeing?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.268
Narj would never
do such a thing.

15:21.311 --> 15:24.184
Not even if we got killed and
you kept your valuable humans?

15:24.227 --> 15:26.490
Plus, you're a tree-- you
probably don't even have bones.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.971
Ridiculous!
Narj is ossified. Narj...

15:29.015 --> 15:30.103
-[gasps]
-Hm?

15:30.146 --> 15:32.235
Moopsy.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.540
-[growls]
-[screaming]

15:34.411 --> 15:37.197
GARY:
It's chugging him!

15:39.939 --> 15:41.679
Wait, the door.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.466
-[yawns]
-Phew, no ladders.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.120
Now it can't get back
through those vents.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.774
Yeah. Now it's trapped in the...

15:49.818 --> 15:52.864
station's main control room.

15:54.344 --> 15:55.955
Moopsy.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.752
Ah, this is perfect.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.841
A nice, dark Jefferies Tube

16:12.884 --> 16:15.670
where we can't hear anyone
decapitate Peter Pan.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.889
Ah, this is much better
than the bunks.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.239
-Hey, Boimler.
-Aah!

16:19.282 --> 16:20.240
What you doing in here?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.545
Hey, Rutherford.

16:21.589 --> 16:25.245
Uh, I live here now.
You doing a systems check?

16:25.288 --> 16:26.855
Nah, I'm trying to find a way
to diffuse heat conduction

16:26.898 --> 16:28.248
by a few nanojoules.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.380
Oh, some ensign
just came through here

16:30.424 --> 16:32.382
doing the exact same thing.

16:32.426 --> 16:34.123
Seemed like a real wunderkind.
I was impressed.

16:34.167 --> 16:35.516
[scoffs] Livik.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.432
Leave some minor improvements
for the rest of us, guy!

16:38.475 --> 16:40.042
-Dinner later?
-Sure.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.698
[Gary screaming]

16:43.741 --> 16:45.265
Hey, calm down.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.876
You calm down! If you two
hadn't been bickering,

16:47.919 --> 16:50.313
we wouldn't be falling
into a planet!

16:50.357 --> 16:51.923
Nobody's dying today

16:51.967 --> 16:54.274
because I'm gonna crawl through
the vents, unlock the door,

16:54.317 --> 16:55.405
and get the Moopsy
to chase me out,

16:55.449 --> 16:56.711
so you two can rush in
and stabilize

16:56.754 --> 16:58.582
the orbit
while it drinks my bones.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.280
-[grunts]
-Stand down, Mariner.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.455
Jack, we are plummeting.

17:01.498 --> 17:03.457
Even if this works,
we'll only stop re-entry

17:03.500 --> 17:05.198
by the skin of our teeth.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.722
Wait, that's it. Mariner,

17:07.765 --> 17:09.028
punch me in the face.

17:09.984 --> 17:11.377
That's an order, Lieutenant.

17:11.421 --> 17:12.944
Okay. [grunts]

17:12.988 --> 17:15.338
Come on, as hard as you can.
[grunts]

17:15.382 --> 17:17.297
[grunts]

17:17.339 --> 17:18.646
-That thing wants bones?
-[exclaiming]

17:18.689 --> 17:19.820
We'll give it bones.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.300
MARINER:
Oh, you're a genius.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.346
-[grunting]
-[both laughing]

17:24.739 --> 17:28.176
I should have been
an outpost scientist.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.310
-[panting]
-Wait, Rutherford,

17:30.353 --> 17:31.876
you've been working yourself
to death all day.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.661
-You don't have to do this.
-No.

17:33.704 --> 17:35.315
This time I nailed it.

17:35.358 --> 17:37.143
I sped up the replicators
by nine whole femtoseconds.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.883
I'm definitely getting
a promotion now.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.451
You and I'll be the same rank
and stay friends forever.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.931
Billups. Whew.
It took an unbelievable

17:42.974 --> 17:44.802
amount of engineering,
but I finally

17:44.846 --> 17:46.717
managed...
-I'm sure whatever you did
is great, Mr. Rutherford,

17:46.761 --> 17:49.329
-but it'll have to wait
until after the pip ceremony.
-Huh?

17:49.372 --> 17:50.112
[cheering]

17:52.158 --> 17:53.855
Livik!

17:56.379 --> 17:58.381
I'm sorry, Tendi.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.688
I let you down.

18:00.731 --> 18:03.256
-Mr. Rutherford,
stand at attention.
-What?

18:03.299 --> 18:05.736
I am your superior, Ensign.
Do it.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.651
We'll be friends
no matter what our ranks are.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.392
We're going to spend
tons of time hanging out

18:09.436 --> 18:11.612
and talking about science
and telling jokes and, you know,

18:11.655 --> 18:13.831
do all the things we used to do.
And that's an order.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.443
-Yes, ma'am.
-[both laugh]

18:16.486 --> 18:18.358
Oh, my gosh,
I just gave my first order.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.925
-Oh.
-Man, now I wish

18:20.969 --> 18:23.580
I hadn't turned down
all those promotions.

18:23.624 --> 18:24.625
Sorry, what?

18:24.668 --> 18:26.061
You know,
for saving the Cerritos

18:26.105 --> 18:27.236
from the Pakleds

18:27.280 --> 18:28.890
and the Rubidoux
from the space jellyfish,

18:28.933 --> 18:29.934
stuff like that.

18:29.978 --> 18:32.023
Wait, why did you
turn them all down?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.635
[sighs] Because I didn't
want my own room

18:34.678 --> 18:36.202
where I wouldn't be near you.

18:36.245 --> 18:39.814
Aw, Rutherford, but can't you
just go accept one right now?

18:39.857 --> 18:42.251
Nah, they took it really
seriously in engineering.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.384
-You have to earn it
with a scientific...
-Hey, Billups!

18:44.427 --> 18:45.428
Can Rutherford
have his promotion

18:45.472 --> 18:47.256
for that time
he removed the hull?

18:47.300 --> 18:50.694
Oh, sure. Ah, sorry, Livik,
maybe next time.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.438
Wait, I can just ask
for stuff I deserve?

18:55.482 --> 18:58.659
-I guess.
-[chanting]: Rutherford!
Rutherford!

18:58.702 --> 19:01.836
Hooray! [laughs, whoops]
Thanks, everyone.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.447
Rutherford.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.406
And also Tendi.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.147
[alarm blaring]

19:11.933 --> 19:13.413
Moopsy.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.505
[grunting]

19:23.118 --> 19:24.511
Moopsy.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.601
[grunts] Got you,
you cuddly little murderer.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.821
[laughs] We say-bih-eye
da say-sa orbih!

19:30.865 --> 19:32.475
[snorts] What's that, Gummy?

19:32.519 --> 19:34.260
We stabilized
the station's orbit.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.567
Oh, man, victory
really is that much sweeter

19:37.611 --> 19:39.265
when you almost got killed.

19:39.308 --> 19:40.614
I just wish
we could have figured out

19:40.657 --> 19:42.703
how this little guy got out
in the first place.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.966
I mean, it clearly wasn't Narj,
dude was brimming with bones.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.402
[lisping]:
Let's get these humans

19:46.446 --> 19:48.535
out of here. Starfleet security
can figure it out.

19:48.578 --> 19:50.798
Well, at least
it wasn't our fault.

19:50.841 --> 19:52.626
You know, humans
are always being blamed

19:52.669 --> 19:55.716
for being dangerous,
but we don't have claws or fangs

19:55.759 --> 19:57.021
-or...
-Hey, that umbrella

19:57.065 --> 19:58.632
is upside down, yeah?

20:03.854 --> 20:06.074
Did you [bleep] rewire
the Moopsy door?

20:06.117 --> 20:08.163
-You could've got us all killed.
-RANSOM: Wow.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.340
I guess humans really are
the most dangerous game.

20:11.384 --> 20:13.299
Damn it.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.128
MARINER:
Lieutenant junior grade's log..

20:17.172 --> 20:20.001
Nope, no, too weird.
Uh, let's go with

20:20.044 --> 20:22.917
Mariner's log.
So, yeah, of course

20:22.960 --> 20:24.310
it was the humans
in the menagerie

20:24.353 --> 20:25.963
that set the Moopsy free.

20:26.007 --> 20:28.052
They'd seen how profitable
they were as an attraction,

20:28.096 --> 20:31.186
so they wanted to kill Narj and
keep the station for themselve.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.493
Humans-- we really
are the worst.

20:33.536 --> 20:34.885
-[laughs]
-MARINER: So, anyway,

20:34.929 --> 20:37.366
instead of bringing them
to theCerritos, we left them

20:37.410 --> 20:39.934
in the menagerie until somebody
else has time to pick them up.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.327
Could take a while.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.503
As for Ransom,
it took some doing,

20:43.546 --> 20:45.505
but Dr. T'Ana was able
to fix him up

20:45.548 --> 20:46.897
with a new set of chompers.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.595
Just don't eat any hard stuff
for a few days

20:48.638 --> 20:51.119
while the veneers set.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:51.162 --> 20:53.034
I have to go kill
the sheriff of Nottingham

20:53.077 --> 20:54.427
for being a little [bleep] face.

20:54.470 --> 20:55.689
[laughs]

20:55.732 --> 20:57.995
So, uh, sorry I knocked
all your teeth out.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.736
I ended up only needing,
like, ten of them.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.130
I was just happy
you were following my orders.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.175
I'm sorry I doubted you, sir.

21:04.219 --> 21:06.308
I haven't always been the
most supportive over the years,

21:06.352 --> 21:08.354
but at least now you know
I'm definitely not gonna let you

21:08.397 --> 21:09.920
self-sabotage anymore.

21:09.964 --> 21:12.358
So, maybe we can cool it
on the reign of terror.

21:12.401 --> 21:15.056
Yeah. Yeah.
That'll be, uh, interesting.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.144
Trust me, Mariner,

21:16.187 --> 21:18.146
you're gonna be a great officer.

21:18.189 --> 21:19.887
Just like me.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.195
-Congrats on the promotion, man.
-Thanks.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.806
And great call on us
being roommates.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.982
We're gonna get even better
quarters than if we were alone.

21:28.025 --> 21:30.550
Oh, really? No way.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.768
[chuckles]
Aah!

21:31.812 --> 21:34.205
No! Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
this can't be happening.

21:34.249 --> 21:35.468
Whoa! That's bright.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.209
Just got to dim the view ports,

21:38.253 --> 21:40.168
and we're all set.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.822
[whimpers]

21:41.865 --> 21:44.215
Hope you don't mind me tinkering
on projects all night. Ow!

21:44.259 --> 21:47.131
[chuckles] If you see any
sparks, just stamp them out.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.350
[sighs]

21:48.394 --> 21:50.134
Ooh! Ah...

21:52.572 --> 21:53.921
Huh.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.270
You know what?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.925
This is already starting
to feel like home.
