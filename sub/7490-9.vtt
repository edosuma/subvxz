WEBVTT

00:07.375 --> 00:09.750
- Winner!
-

00:11.709 --> 00:14.834
Kim, you just won a match
in the All Wasabi Invitational.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.125
This has to be the most
amazing moment of your life.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.500
Well, actually,
witnessing my sister's birth--

00:19.583 --> 00:20.583
Boring!

00:23.875 --> 00:25.000
It's all tied up.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.500
If we win the last match,

00:26.583 --> 00:29.125
we're the number 1 dojo
in the Bobby Wasabi chain.

00:29.625 --> 00:31.208
Jack, you're up. Are you ready?

00:31.834 --> 00:35.000
Well, yeah, but I thought Bobby Wasabi
was going to be here.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.291
People, Bobby can show up
whenever he wants.

00:38.750 --> 00:39.917
Or he's here now.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.959
- Bobby, welcome.
- I'm sorry.

00:44.041 --> 00:47.041
I... was hoping to slip in unnoticed.

00:49.250 --> 00:54.166
S, how much is my Pittsburgh dojo
winning by, hmm?

00:54.250 --> 00:55.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.083
For your information, we're kicking butt.

01:00.208 --> 01:01.041
Oh, that's rich.

01:01.125 --> 01:04.291
Almost as rich as my labradoodle
will be when I die.

01:08.458 --> 01:10.750
Seriously, you're-- you're winning?

01:11.542 --> 01:13.166
If we win this last match.

01:13.625 --> 01:15.583
Well, let's do this!

01:17.000 --> 01:18.875
Jack, you can do this.

01:18.959 --> 01:21.166
You want to know why
there's a heat wave outside?

01:21.250 --> 01:23.542
Because you're on fire!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.750
Fire! Celebrities first!

01:25.834 --> 01:27.250
Wait, wait, wait! No fire.

01:27.333 --> 01:28.375
Just a pep talk.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.583
Oh, well...

01:31.417 --> 01:34.834
Before the match begins,
I have an announcement.

01:34.917 --> 01:39.542
This month, there will be an article
on the principles of the Wasabi code

01:39.625 --> 01:43.208
in <i>Karatefancy</i> Magazine!

01:43.834 --> 01:47.333
The winning dojo will receive
a gift from me,

01:47.417 --> 01:51.166
and the winning sensei will appear
on the cover with me.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.250
-
- Do you guys know what this means?

01:53.333 --> 01:54.458
If I'm on the cover with Bobby,

01:54.542 --> 01:56.709
people will finally know how great I am.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.291
And humble.

02:01.083 --> 02:04.500
Ho-ho, this is going to be exciting.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.875
Evan, sausage me!

02:12.000 --> 02:12.959
<i>You got this, Jack.</i>

02:13.041 --> 02:14.417
<i>Let's go, Jack!</i>
- Fight!

02:21.208 --> 02:23.208
<i>It's all right, Jack.
Yeah, come on, Jack.</i>

02:31.542 --> 02:33.208
- Winner!
-

02:33.291 --> 02:34.291
We did it, we won!

02:34.375 --> 02:36.458
We're number 1! Whoo!

02:36.542 --> 02:38.542
Come on, Rudy. On our shoulders.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.458
- Once around the dojo.
- Uh, no, no, guys!

02:40.542 --> 02:43.291
At no point should my head be higher
than Bobby Wasabi.

02:43.375 --> 02:45.959
Ooh, I love shoulder rides.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.542
Okay, kids, let's lift with the legs.

02:52.792 --> 02:56.083

03:38.250 --> 03:40.375
What do you think Bobby's special gift
Is going to be?

03:40.458 --> 03:41.959
Oh, I wish it was cash.

03:42.041 --> 03:43.625
My parents turned my cell phone off

03:43.709 --> 03:45.417
because I went over my limit by a few...

03:46.208 --> 03:47.500
thousand texts.

03:50.125 --> 03:52.250
You realize I have to go back
to speaking to people?

03:52.625 --> 03:54.458
I don't want to speak to people.

03:54.542 --> 03:55.875
I can't. I won't.

03:58.834 --> 03:59.917
I'm sorry, what?

04:01.625 --> 04:02.500
Forget it.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.709
Hey, Phil, it's a thousand degrees out.

04:04.792 --> 04:06.166
Can you turn the air conditioning up?

04:06.250 --> 04:07.792
It is as up as it goes.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.041
I wish I could close and go to the beach.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.834
Today would be a perfect day for me

04:11.917 --> 04:13.458
to be wearing my mankini.

04:15.083 --> 04:16.875
- You wear a--
- Yes, of course!

04:16.959 --> 04:18.667
All the men in my village, we wear them.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.500
The sight of us is the only thing

04:20.583 --> 04:22.959
that drives the seals back into the sea.

04:24.959 --> 04:28.583
I bet a lot of people working here
would love to go to the beach.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.792
Well, why don't we bring
the beach to them?

04:31.875 --> 04:34.625
All we need is a little sand,
the sound of waves...

04:34.709 --> 04:37.834
A wading pool, some beach chairs,
some spray misters.

04:38.458 --> 04:41.166
People would pay for a quick
little beach experience.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.875
And I can make enough money
to turn my phone back on!

04:44.417 --> 04:46.083
What do you say? Partners?

04:46.583 --> 04:47.542
Partners.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.000
Hey, I couldn't help but eve-dropping.

04:51.083 --> 04:54.583
If you guys have a problem
with seals on the beach,

04:54.667 --> 04:56.583
- I can--
- Not gonna happen, Phil.

04:57.959 --> 04:58.875
Fine.

04:58.959 --> 05:01.750
But when the seals take over,
don't come crying to Phil.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.834
It will happen.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.750
Just set it on the mat.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.959
Guys, the gift that Bobby sent us

05:13.041 --> 05:14.834
for winning the tournament
is finally here.

05:14.917 --> 05:16.750
- I'll get a crowbar.
- Oh, no need.

05:16.834 --> 05:17.959
Third-degree black belt.

05:18.041 --> 05:20.291
I'm always packing two.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.041
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.458
Um, what is it?

05:40.375 --> 05:41.250
It's a dude.

05:42.834 --> 05:46.542
It's not a dude.
It's a piece of film history.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.875
This is a statue of Bobby Wasabi

05:48.959 --> 05:52.500
from his classic 1974 movie <i>Dojo of Wax.</i>

05:53.083 --> 05:54.667
Okay, so it's a dude made of wax.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.458
I don't get it. How is this stupid statue

05:58.542 --> 06:00.667
supposed to show everyone
that we're his number 1 dojo?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.333
Don't you dare talk in that tone!

06:03.542 --> 06:05.291
And when Bobby comes here
for the picture tomorrow,

06:05.375 --> 06:06.500
you'd better act grateful.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.667
Yo, this thing's kinda creeping me out.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.834
Its eyes are following me
everywhere I go-- oh!

06:20.667 --> 06:22.333
Milton, we need to be more aggressive.

06:22.417 --> 06:25.000
Go drum up some business. Try, um...

06:25.625 --> 06:27.083
<i>Hey, that woman over there.</i>

06:28.875 --> 06:31.417
Since we're partners
and I'm in the middle of folding towels,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.208
why don't you go do it?
You're just standing there.

06:35.208 --> 06:38.583
Look, this is our beehive.

06:39.083 --> 06:43.000
And in a beehive, there are workers
and there's the queen.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.500
Why can't I be the--

06:47.792 --> 06:48.875
Fine.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.291
I'll be the worker.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.458
Hello, ma'am.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.625
I noticed you from across the courtyard

06:59.709 --> 07:02.375
and I must say, you look really hot.

07:03.792 --> 07:06.333
I'd like to take you to the beach,
lay you down,

07:06.417 --> 07:09.667
rub oil all over you-- Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:09.750 --> 07:11.458
This is only making you hotter!

07:11.542 --> 07:13.625
Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:19.125 --> 07:21.625
Guys. Guys, I've asked you
a hundred times.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.959
Keep the door closed, all right?

07:24.542 --> 07:26.917
I'm trying to keep
the air conditioning in, all right?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.917
The statue's made of wax.
I need to keep it cool in here.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.917
Okay.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.208
What's that?

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
Oh, it's a sign we got
from my uncle's junkyard.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.834
It used to hang over
the men's store downtown.

07:36.917 --> 07:38.125
"We're number 1"?

07:38.208 --> 07:40.834
We didn't take the part that said
"In men's underpants."

07:42.041 --> 07:43.792
I never understood why that store closed.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.500
They sold great underpants
at a fair price.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.875
Okay. Well, what's the sign doing here?

07:48.959 --> 07:51.875
That dumb statue isn't going
to show anyone we won the tournament.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.709
Yeah, it's our way
of letting people know we're number 1.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.917
Oh, especially cute girls who can read.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.166
That's right. I have a type.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.125
Come on, at least let us turn it on.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.333
- Let's see what it looks like lit up.
- Okay, fine.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.333
- Yes! Go to the other side.
- Go ahead and plug it in.

08:07.417 --> 08:08.917
- All right.
- <i>Hold up, hold up, ready?</i>

08:12.375 --> 08:15.125
Oh, great. Your cruddy sign
blew our power out.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.333
I think our cruddy sign
blew the power out.

08:19.041 --> 08:21.458
And it's not just us.
The power's out in the whole mall.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.709
- What?
- Yeah.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.917
Oh, no. No, no, no!

08:26.000 --> 08:27.750
Oh, there's no air conditioning.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.125
And it's already getting warmer in here.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.000
Oh, no. Oh, this isn't good.

08:33.083 --> 08:37.667
"Exposure to temperatures above 74 degrees
will cause statue to soften

08:37.750 --> 08:39.834
and result in permanent disfigurement."

08:39.917 --> 08:42.625
That's it. My life is over.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.917
Bobby's going to be here in four hours
for the photo shoot,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.375
and when he gets here,
he's going to meet blobby.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.917
- Blobby Wasabi, that's--
- Shut it, Jerry!

08:52.792 --> 08:55.875
I can just kiss goodbye my cover
of <i>Karatefancy</i> magazine.

08:57.458 --> 09:00.750
This heat wave is going
to kill Bobby Wasabi!

09:04.792 --> 09:07.125
Rudy, you've gotta calm down.
We've just gotta figure this out, okay?

09:07.208 --> 09:08.834
Don't you dare tell me what to do!

09:08.917 --> 09:10.542
All right, just keep fanning Bobby.

09:11.583 --> 09:14.583
Man, this is the worst heat wave
this city's ever had.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.792
And because of us,
everyone's air conditioning's out.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.792
At least no one knows it's our fault.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.959
I know it was your fault!

09:22.041 --> 09:24.625
You karate people, you did this!

09:24.709 --> 09:28.041
Because of your fancy underpants sign,
my meat is going bad,

09:28.125 --> 09:30.333
and my goat is drinking out
of the toilet bowl.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.959
Phil. Phil, I tried calling
an electrician, but they're all busy.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.291
Okay, you come with me to the roof.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.834
If i don't get the power back on,

09:38.917 --> 09:41.375
my wife will go crazy
and miss the latest episode

09:41.458 --> 09:43.583
of <i>The Real Housewives
of Hakmakistan.</i>

09:44.834 --> 09:46.709
Rudy, what about the statue?
What should we do?

09:46.792 --> 09:48.792
Just take him someplace cold.

09:48.875 --> 09:49.834
All right, if it melts,

09:49.917 --> 09:52.542
my dream of being on the cover
of <i>Karatefancy</i> melts with it.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.500
Don't worry, nothing's gonna happen
to this statue.

09:55.583 --> 09:58.625
All we gotta do is take it someplace cold.
Let's go, come on.

09:59.709 --> 10:02.667
Whoa, we should probably
bring Bobby with us.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.875
<i>♪ And no matter how much
I chop and punch ♪</i>

10:04.959 --> 10:07.542
<i>♪ It's not as cool
As kickin' it with you. ♪</i>

10:07.834 --> 10:10.667
This blackout is the best thing
that ever happened to us.

10:10.750 --> 10:11.959
With no air conditioning,

10:12.041 --> 10:15.166
people can't wait to get their hot feet
into our cool water.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.417
Now go squeegee off the sweaty guy.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.500
I just squeegeed him twice.
I think he likes it too much.

10:23.583 --> 10:26.000
Just do it. Towels are expensive.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.709
And when you're done,
sell some of this fancy imported water.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.041
It's from the French Alps.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.417
It's from the hose behind Reptile World.

10:35.458 --> 10:37.667
It's called maximizing profits.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.250
Every dime brings me closer
to getting my cell phone back on.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.458
This is Dale "Heatwave" Davis,

10:56.542 --> 10:58.583
coming to you live from the Bay view mall.

10:58.667 --> 11:02.500
It is so hot, I literally have
a swamp in my pants.

11:03.166 --> 11:05.208
But two young entrepreneurs
have found a way

11:05.291 --> 11:09.041
to turn a record-breaking heat wave
into cold hard cash.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.667
Oh, it's not just cash, Dale.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.667
We also accept checks and credit cards.

11:13.458 --> 11:15.542
And if you come down between
the hours of 5:00 and 6:00,

11:15.625 --> 11:16.875
I'll have the boy fan ya.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.375
I told you I'm not fanning people anymore.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.792
It makes me feel cheap.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.834
I'm sorry. Uh, is this your partner?

11:23.917 --> 11:27.250
Uh, yes, my, uh, silent partner,

11:27.333 --> 11:29.291
who should be fluffing towels right now.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.250
You know, I'm sick and tired
of you bossing me around.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.166
Hm. We'll talk about this later.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.417
The man is trying to do a story.

11:37.458 --> 11:38.875
Yeah? You want a story?

11:38.959 --> 11:42.000
- Our sunblock is just mayonnaise.
-

11:42.083 --> 11:45.000
And we made our lemonade with pool water.

11:45.083 --> 11:47.500
I-- that's it! This interview is over!

11:48.208 --> 11:49.625
Head on down. Free fans.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.667
This is Dale Davis reporting live
from the Bay view mall.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.083
And we're out.
I had some of that lemonade.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.250
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

11:59.625 --> 12:00.583
Trust me, Rudy.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.834
In my country,
I am the village electrician.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.959
I know all about the new technologies.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.667
Okay.

12:11.792 --> 12:13.250
There is your problem.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.500
Where is the goat?

12:15.709 --> 12:16.792
<i>Where is the treadmill?</i>

12:16.875 --> 12:20.291
Where is the carrot on a stick
that the goat chases on the treadmill

12:20.375 --> 12:21.542
to make the power happen?

12:21.625 --> 12:22.959
Get out of the way, please.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.834
Well, maybe if I reset
the circuit breaker,

12:26.917 --> 12:28.291
the power will go back on.

12:32.125 --> 12:33.375
That's your problem.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.166
You can't send a cat to do a goat's job.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.208
That's Tip-tip.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.333
He probably just climbed in there
to get out of the heat.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.792
It worked! The air conditioner's back on.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.375
Our problems are over!

12:53.792 --> 12:57.083
Hey, Rudy, be careful there, okay?
The compressor just kicked in.

12:57.166 --> 12:58.709
It's going to send out a blast of air.

12:58.792 --> 13:00.834
I think I can handle a little air, Phil.

13:06.375 --> 13:09.166
Rudy? Rudy?

13:09.542 --> 13:10.750
Where's Rudy?

13:12.291 --> 13:14.083
Oh!

13:15.542 --> 13:18.125
These are some fancy shoes.

13:20.083 --> 13:23.667
Rudy, I found some great shoes!
You want one?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.333
<i>♪ Come kick it with me ♪</i>

13:33.333 --> 13:35.834
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, it's okay, it's okay.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.667
I put him there. He's not alive.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.959
-
<i>Blizzards' Mancini</i>

13:51.041 --> 13:53.250
<i>goes to the box
for a two-minute penalty.</i>

13:58.709 --> 14:02.959
Hey, puckweed, find another penalty box.
This one's taken.

14:04.917 --> 14:06.875
Whoa! Whoa!

14:06.959 --> 14:09.750
-
<i>Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow!</i>

14:14.625 --> 14:16.291
I don't think
you should be eating that fish.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.417
It's for the penguins.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.166
Oh, no, this little guy doesn't mind.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.250
See, that's the thing about penguins.
They're very generous.

14:22.333 --> 14:25.250
- Right, little cutie?
- His mother doesn't seem too happy.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.166
No, no, dude, trust me.
These penguins are really--

14:31.250 --> 14:33.834
<i>♪ Hey, hey ♪</i>

14:33.917 --> 14:36.208
<i>♪ Come on, kickin' it with you ♪</i>

14:39.625 --> 14:41.083
It sure is hot.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.250
You know, a lot of stores in this mall
give me a discount

14:47.375 --> 14:50.250
on account of I'm mall security and all.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.125
Uh, sorry, Joan, we don't give discounts.

14:54.208 --> 14:56.750
Oh. Oh, okay,
I see how we're gonna play it.

14:56.834 --> 14:57.834
Game on.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.542
I'm gonna need to see your sand permit.

15:03.125 --> 15:06.875
Uh, please enjoy your free
beach experience.

15:06.959 --> 15:09.000
Mm-hm, that's what I thought.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.291
Ah!

15:20.166 --> 15:22.375
Milton, okay, I had an idea,

15:22.375 --> 15:24.250
and put together a beach value pack.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.917
It has seaweed necklaces
and sun reflectors.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.625
Now I want you to push them,
push them hard!

15:30.709 --> 15:32.000
I'm not selling these!

15:32.250 --> 15:35.083
First of all,
sun reflectors are dangerous.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.959
Second of all, these seaweed necklaces
are just wilted lettuce.

15:39.041 --> 15:42.333
It's called maximizing profits.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.208
It's called ripping people off.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.792
- I quit.
- What? Get back here!

15:50.875 --> 15:53.041
- Don't you dare!
- Ugh.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.750
It's little Tip-tip. Hi.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.083
Aww.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.375
Wait, why is he turning around like that?

16:04.709 --> 16:07.083
Oh, he thinks that the sand
is a litter box.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.333
Oh, no! Oh, dear!

16:09.417 --> 16:11.250
Everybody--

16:11.375 --> 16:13.458
- Evacuate the beach!
-

16:13.542 --> 16:16.000
Evacuate the beach! This is not a drill!

16:16.083 --> 16:19.000
We've got a code brown!
Doody on the beach!

16:19.083 --> 16:20.917
- Doody on the beach!
- Come back!

16:21.000 --> 16:22.667
I'll have the boy clean it.

16:26.834 --> 16:28.291
They're not coming back, are they?

16:29.709 --> 16:30.792
Would you?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.166
No.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.291
Okay, you guys, this way.

16:35.375 --> 16:37.291
<i>Open the door. Yeah, there we go.</i>

16:38.166 --> 16:40.583
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!

16:42.000 --> 16:44.041
Oh, Bobby, you're back.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.333
I'm so happy.
I never thought I'd see you again.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.500
You're limping. What happened?

16:48.583 --> 16:51.500
Nothing much. Just fixed the power,
got blown off the roof,

16:51.583 --> 16:53.458
landed in front
of the veterinary hospital.

16:53.542 --> 16:57.250
Nice people. They patched me up
and gave me a coupon for a free flea bath.

16:58.375 --> 16:59.834
Hey, where's your shoes?

17:01.375 --> 17:02.625
I have no idea.

17:03.709 --> 17:04.625
What happened to him?

17:05.208 --> 17:07.959
- Oh.
- Old lady, hockey player, angry penguin.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.166
We've all been there.

17:09.834 --> 17:12.709
Guys, Bobby's going to be here
in one hour for the photo shoot.

17:13.291 --> 17:14.959
He's right. Everyone put on your gi's.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.750
I want you all sparring
when Bobby gets here.

17:19.583 --> 17:22.000
Why don't you go next door
and get yourself a flea bath?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.500
You smell like fish.

17:23.583 --> 17:26.041
Oh, swag!

17:40.041 --> 17:42.000
I can't believe it. How did this happen?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.083
Oh, oh, Bobby.

17:44.667 --> 17:47.625
Oh, Bobby. It's not so bad.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.375
Your legs just got
a little soft, that's all.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.417
We'll just go call the doc.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.959
He'll fix you up.
He'll fix you up real good.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.458
I can't tell if I'm talking
to his face or his butt.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.250
I think it's a little bit of both.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.500
I don't get it. It's cool in here.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.125
The air conditioning is back on.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.834
That reflector out on the beach
is shooting a beam of sun in here.

18:11.458 --> 18:14.208
There's nothing left
but a melted mound of man.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.083
It should have been me! It should've--

18:17.166 --> 18:19.583
- Bobby, you're early.
-

18:19.667 --> 18:22.166
How is my number 1 dojo?

18:22.709 --> 18:24.959
Rudy, are you ready for our picture?

18:30.458 --> 18:34.125
Is that the statue that I gave you?

18:35.375 --> 18:38.083
I honor this dojo with a gift,

18:38.166 --> 18:42.083
and this, this is how you repay me?

18:44.375 --> 18:47.458
I thought you'd turned this dojo around,

18:47.959 --> 18:50.583
but I was wrong.

18:51.959 --> 18:55.208
There will be no cover
of <i>Karatefancy</i> for you.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.333
Wait!

19:00.834 --> 19:03.250
It wasn't Rudy. It was me.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.959
I put up a weird number 1 sign

19:06.041 --> 19:08.291
because I wanted everyone to know
that we won the tournament.

19:08.625 --> 19:09.709
And it caused a blackout.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.250
It was me too.

19:12.667 --> 19:15.041
Rudy taught us true champions
don't have to brag.

19:15.917 --> 19:17.917
Especially with a second hand
underpants sign.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.625
It was my fault. I was angry at Kim,

19:21.709 --> 19:24.375
so I threw down the sun reflector
which melted the statue.

19:24.917 --> 19:28.208
I love science,
but she can be a cruel mistress.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.667
No, Milton, I'm to blame.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.709
I was so obsessed with getting my phone
turned back on

19:35.166 --> 19:37.125
that I went all psycho boss on you.

19:38.583 --> 19:39.583
I'm sorry.

19:39.667 --> 19:43.792
I'm confused!
Who is responsible for melting me?

19:43.875 --> 19:45.250
I am.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.041
Guys, thanks,

19:49.667 --> 19:52.583
but this is my dojo, and I'm responsible
for what happens here.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.917
Bobby, with all due respect,

19:55.875 --> 19:57.458
Rudy is a great sensei.

19:58.375 --> 20:00.875
Boo-hoo, we melted your man candle.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.333
Get over it!

20:03.500 --> 20:05.291
Well, maybe you're right...

20:05.959 --> 20:08.250
little cute, terrifying girl.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.917
But what i just saw here...

20:12.125 --> 20:14.500
is what the Wasabi code is all about.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.625
Honor...

20:20.250 --> 20:21.458
Friendship...

20:23.917 --> 20:25.375
And loyalty.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.083
I'm not quite sure
how the underpants fit in

20:29.208 --> 20:31.417
or why that one has a dog bow in his hair.

20:32.917 --> 20:34.834
But I do know...

20:36.000 --> 20:40.208
this dojo is number 1.

20:41.375 --> 20:42.750
And you're right, Jack.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.834
Everyone should see that.

20:46.125 --> 20:47.417
- Uh...
- No! No, no, no.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.375
<i>I don't think you should--</i>

20:52.375 --> 20:54.709
Looks like your cruddy sign
blew out the power.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.125
Bye.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.959
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

21:03.417 --> 21:04.417
Hey, guys.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.500
Hey, how was the photo shoot
for <i>Karatefancy</i> ?

21:06.583 --> 21:08.375
Only the highlight of my life.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.375
Oh. Hey, I don't get it.

21:10.458 --> 21:13.375
The power's out in the rest of the mall,
but Phil has power.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.208
Okay, tootsie,

21:15.291 --> 21:16.917
- time to turn on the blender.
-

21:17.000 --> 21:21.041
Get on your treadmill and run, baby,
run like the wind.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.333
Yeah, you like your new shoes, huh?

21:24.667 --> 21:26.041
My shoes!

21:26.834 --> 21:28.500
Hey, finder keeper!
