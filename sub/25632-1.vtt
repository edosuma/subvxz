01:25.320 --> 01:26.255
Okay.

01:27.089 --> 01:28.756
I'm leaving.

01:28.758 --> 01:29.827
Rosy...

01:30.726 --> 01:31.862
Wait.

01:55.152 --> 01:57.188
I'll get off just here
in the corner.

02:03.259 --> 02:04.428
There you go.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.265
Thank you.

02:51.811 --> 02:53.914
- What's your name?
- Rosy.

02:54.613 --> 02:56.013
I'm James.

02:56.015 --> 02:57.750
So you're the girl
in the photos?

02:58.985 --> 03:01.453
Yes.
That's me.

03:01.455 --> 03:03.457
Well, I'm honored.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.189
Don't be.

03:05.191 --> 03:07.459
Marty's really not that good.

03:07.461 --> 03:09.394
Well, I won't
tell him you said that,

03:09.396 --> 03:11.195
because he's my best friend.

03:11.197 --> 03:12.963
He's mine, too.

03:12.965 --> 03:14.569
But he's never
mentioned you.

03:15.101 --> 03:16.837
Come on, why
would he?

03:20.040 --> 03:21.608
Where is he anyway?

03:22.541 --> 03:23.875
Marty.

03:27.982 --> 03:29.748
Are you a model?

03:29.750 --> 03:31.583
God, no. No.

03:31.585 --> 03:32.720
I'm an actress.

03:32.987 --> 03:34.119
Oh.

03:34.121 --> 03:35.888
Unofficially.
I'm in school for it.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.156
It's a tough business.

03:37.158 --> 03:38.690
Yeah, I can handle it.

03:38.692 --> 03:40.325
I'm feisty.

03:41.896 --> 03:42.898
Yeah, I got that.

03:45.198 --> 03:46.767
Can I say something?

03:47.734 --> 03:48.635
Yes.

03:48.637 --> 03:50.639
You are absolutely beautiful.

03:51.507 --> 03:52.873
He's married.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.074
- Mart.
- He's married.

03:54.076 --> 03:55.342
We were just
looking for you.

03:55.344 --> 03:57.246
- Yeah.
- Well, just in time.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.846
So, is this your girlfriend?

04:00.848 --> 04:02.214
This is my muse.

04:02.216 --> 04:03.852
Oh. Oh, okay.

04:05.586 --> 04:07.457
Is that gonna make
this awkward?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.157
Make what awkward?

04:10.159 --> 04:11.594
Our friendship.

04:12.696 --> 04:13.861
Get out of here.

04:13.863 --> 04:14.962
Where?

04:14.964 --> 04:15.963
Scram.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.165
Come on, now.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.266
Settle down.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.067
I loved the show.
Great job.

04:20.070 --> 04:21.134
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.636
Thank you for Rosy.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.504
You're welcome.

04:24.506 --> 04:26.441
Did you check out the
miniatures by the corner there?

04:26.443 --> 04:27.408
Yeah, I loved them.

04:27.410 --> 04:28.576
- Check 'em out.
- I will.

04:28.578 --> 04:29.744
They're worth revisiting.

04:29.746 --> 04:30.778
Oh, okay. Okay.

04:30.780 --> 04:33.013
Thank you, James.
See you soon.

04:33.015 --> 04:34.014
See you around.

04:34.016 --> 04:35.116
Come on.
Don't look back.

04:35.118 --> 04:36.118
I'm not.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.452
You do not wanna
be talking to that guy.

04:37.454 --> 04:38.519
Who is he?

04:38.521 --> 04:39.755
He's a recovering alcoholic,

04:39.757 --> 04:42.026
- gambler, sex addict...
- Stop.

06:08.548 --> 06:09.983
Help!

06:10.616 --> 06:11.753
Help!

06:14.888 --> 06:16.391
Help!

06:17.658 --> 06:19.093
Help!

06:51.827 --> 06:52.959
Don't be scared.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.231
I'm sorry.
That's the chloroform.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.466
No! Get away!

07:02.205 --> 07:03.507
Who are you?

07:04.073 --> 07:05.175
Help!

07:06.208 --> 07:09.045
Please! Somebody help me!

07:09.746 --> 07:10.612
Somebody!

07:10.614 --> 07:12.814
Here's your purse
and your jacket.

07:12.816 --> 07:16.186
And I left a few things of
mine in the dresser for you.

07:17.820 --> 07:20.020
Here's a monitor
with a built-in camera.

07:25.329 --> 07:26.562
So that if you ever
need anything,

07:26.564 --> 07:27.732
you can just let me know.

07:29.901 --> 07:32.000
You seem upset.

07:32.002 --> 07:34.569
So I'm gonna go get you
something to eat,

07:34.571 --> 07:36.872
and I'm sure you're gonna
feel better.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.207
Just, you know...
Just calm down,

07:39.209 --> 07:40.778
make yourself at home.

07:41.545 --> 07:42.947

09:13.207 --> 09:14.208
I'm a good person,

09:16.378 --> 09:17.879
and I brought you here

09:19.214 --> 09:20.215

Uh-huh.

11:25.612 --> 11:27.579
You play those instruments?

11:27.581 --> 11:30.185
No, those are for decoration.

11:32.418 --> 11:34.321
Sorry, I'm just being shy...

11:37.390 --> 11:38.791
Mm-hmm.

11:38.793 --> 11:41.196
So, you're a musician.

11:42.395 --> 11:43.427
No.

11:43.429 --> 11:45.399
I make documentaries.

11:49.103 --> 11:51.773
You never told me you were
in the movie business.

11:52.573 --> 11:54.109
Well, you never asked.

11:56.044 --> 11:56.912
True.

11:57.913 --> 11:59.448
Documentaries about what?

12:01.082 --> 12:01.984
Music...

12:02.317 --> 12:03.486
Oh.

12:04.119 --> 12:05.020
There you go.

12:09.356 --> 12:10.492
Wow.

12:12.895 --> 12:15.531
So... what's wrong
with me?

12:16.665 --> 12:18.200
What do you mean?
Nothing.

12:20.703 --> 12:22.238
Are you unhappily married?

12:24.239 --> 12:26.442
Oh... Where is she,
by the way?

12:30.079 --> 12:33.413
I didn't expect you to
be so forward. I...

12:33.415 --> 12:35.786
just liked you and was
curious to see you again.

12:39.989 --> 12:41.825
You didn't answer my question.

12:45.661 --> 12:46.797
I...

12:47.830 --> 12:49.197
think I made a mistake.

12:49.199 --> 12:50.799
You're just making fun of me.

12:50.801 --> 12:54.205
And I know this whole age thing
is not supposed to matter, but...

12:54.937 --> 12:56.373
So you want to fuck me?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.213
I'm sorry.
I think you should go.

13:08.219 --> 13:09.121
James...

13:10.855 --> 13:12.224
Let's start over.

13:25.336 --> 13:28.137
Rosy, it's been two days.

13:28.139 --> 13:30.610
I wasn't counting on this.
I know you must be hungry.

13:33.511 --> 13:34.913
Will you just try
one bite?

13:35.547 --> 13:37.050
Please, just try
one bite.

13:38.683 --> 13:39.952
Don't do this to me.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.622
It's good.

13:44.523 --> 13:45.490
Look...

13:46.792 --> 13:49.196
you seem nice.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.730
And I get it.

13:53.732 --> 13:58.072
You think you can't let me go because
I'll go straight to the police.

13:59.572 --> 14:00.474
But I won't.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.410
We can fix this.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.280
It'll be like
it never happened.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.915
I mean that.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.183
You can just
drive me home

14:12.185 --> 14:14.555
and no one will ever notice
that I was gone.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.224
It'll be our secret.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.360
Please?

14:21.362 --> 14:23.899
Sorry. It's just...

14:26.633 --> 14:27.568
I'm sorry.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.306
I can't eat your
fucking food!

14:33.473 --> 14:34.376
Hmm?

14:35.477 --> 14:36.445
I'm a vegan.

14:59.701 --> 15:01.071
What's your name?

15:02.105 --> 15:03.340
Thanks for asking.

15:04.474 --> 15:05.509
My name's Doug.

15:07.042 --> 15:08.378
And you're Rosy?

15:11.947 --> 15:13.316
How'd you know
my name?

15:14.850 --> 15:16.119
Here.

15:27.664 --> 15:29.100
Where are you going?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.269
- I have to pee.
- Oh.

15:33.770 --> 15:34.705
Oh.

15:35.505 --> 15:36.707
Go ahead.

15:38.274 --> 15:39.209
Okay.

15:44.048 --> 15:46.216
So you took
the bathroom door away?

15:46.850 --> 15:48.250
Yes, I did.

15:48.252 --> 15:49.988
So you wouldn't
lock yourself in.

15:52.256 --> 15:53.157
Why me?

15:53.791 --> 15:54.692
Pardon?

15:56.160 --> 15:58.097
Why'd you pick me
to kidnap?

16:03.367 --> 16:05.470
Because I think
we have a connection.

16:05.737 --> 16:06.671
A what?

16:07.605 --> 16:08.607
A connection.

16:11.377 --> 16:14.247
How can we have a connection if
we don't even know each other?

16:17.650 --> 16:19.883
People see each other
in places every day

16:19.885 --> 16:22.155
and they think, "That could
be the person for me."

16:26.157 --> 16:28.027
You know, people are
gonna be looking for me.

17:00.661 --> 17:01.797
<i>Hi, Rosy.</i>

17:03.797 --> 17:05.731
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.667
<i>Hi.</i>

17:09.069 --> 17:10.801
<i>Uh...</i>

17:10.804 --> 17:13.174
<i>I'm gonna leave and
I'm gonna be gone for a while.</i>

17:14.840 --> 17:16.143
Where are you going?

17:17.109 --> 17:18.511
<i>I'm heading out to work.</i>

17:18.512 --> 17:20.448
<i>I'll be back
late tonight though.</i>

17:23.151 --> 17:24.286
I'll be here.

17:25.753 --> 17:26.755
<i>What did you say?</i>

17:41.770 --> 17:42.738
Hello.

17:56.318 --> 17:57.553
Do you work here?

17:57.954 --> 18:00.021
Yeah.

18:00.023 --> 18:01.792
May I speak
to your manager, please?

18:12.068 --> 18:13.704
We're investigating
a missing girl.

18:59.852 --> 19:00.787
Uh, hello?

19:02.020 --> 19:03.455
<i>This is Dr. Godin here.</i>

19:04.323 --> 19:06.122
Hello, Dr. Godin. Hi.

19:06.124 --> 19:08.025
<i>Hi. I'm glad I finally
reached you.</i>

19:08.027 --> 19:09.994
<i>I've left several messages.</i>

19:09.996 --> 19:12.332
Well, I've been staying
at my grandmother's house.

19:12.897 --> 19:14.433
<i>I have an update.</i>

19:15.934 --> 19:18.936
<i>Your grandmother's vitals
have been improving a lot.</i>

19:18.938 --> 19:22.676
<i>I'm confident that she could
very well regain consciousness.</i>

19:25.712 --> 19:27.245
What?

19:27.247 --> 19:30.785
<i>It's not a promise, it's just that...
It could go that way.</i>

19:31.718 --> 19:34.786
<i>Now, there has been
some damage.</i>

19:34.788 --> 19:35.854
<i>The oxygen...</i>

19:35.856 --> 19:37.721
What's the damage?

19:37.723 --> 19:41.558
<i>I'm not sure if she'll
ever be able to walk again.</i>

19:41.560 --> 19:45.697
<i>And she will certainly have
difficulty speaking.</i>

19:45.699 --> 19:49.835
<i>You should come meet with us
to discuss the prospects.</i>

19:49.837 --> 19:53.405
<i>Following rehabilitation, you have
to think about things like...</i>

19:53.407 --> 19:54.539
Wait, you're saying...

19:54.541 --> 19:56.842
<i>...your home to be
wheelchair accessible.</i>

19:56.844 --> 19:59.444
You're saying that
I could have her back?

19:59.446 --> 20:02.751
<i>It's looking a lot more likely.
That's all I can say.</i>

20:07.789 --> 20:08.857
Can I ask you something?

20:09.190 --> 20:10.556
<i>Yep.</i>

20:10.558 --> 20:11.527
Um...

20:12.994 --> 20:14.360
It's...

20:14.362 --> 20:16.296
Would she be like, um...

20:16.298 --> 20:18.568
cognizant of things
going on around her?

20:19.033 --> 20:20.270
<i>How do you mean?</i>

21:41.018 --> 21:42.454
Oh, come on!

22:00.739 --> 22:01.842
Fuck!

23:12.013 --> 23:13.346
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:13.348 --> 23:14.748
I picked you up
some takeout,

23:14.750 --> 23:16.682
and I got you some healthy
snacks to have down here.

23:16.684 --> 23:19.419
Oh, thanks. Can you just put
them over there on the dresser?

23:19.421 --> 23:21.458
I'm actually not that hungry
right now.

23:30.634 --> 23:32.400
- What's this?
- What?

23:32.402 --> 23:34.168
Here. What is this?

23:34.170 --> 23:36.637
Oh. That. Hah!

23:36.639 --> 23:40.674
Um, that's... That's how
long I've been here for.

23:40.676 --> 23:42.011
I hope you don't mind.

23:43.413 --> 23:44.781
I'm just keeping track.

23:46.716 --> 23:47.918
Hmm.

23:51.989 --> 23:53.191
Where's the vase?

23:54.392 --> 23:57.062
Just there on the floor.
I moved it.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.877
How was your day?

24:11.208 --> 24:12.210
Good.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.146
I'm pretty tired.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.947
I think I'm just gonna
go to bed tonight.

24:17.949 --> 24:19.848
You look pretty spent
yourself.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.686
Yeah, you could say that.

24:23.855 --> 24:24.891
Good night.

24:26.358 --> 24:27.527
'Night.

24:51.484 --> 24:52.886
I forgot to grab this.

24:59.525 --> 25:01.629
My grandmother may be
moving in with us.

25:05.062 --> 25:05.065
Great.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.368
What is she like?

25:09.370 --> 25:10.338
She's great.

25:11.271 --> 25:12.674
I'm sure.

25:14.541 --> 25:16.608
Does she know
that I'm here?

25:16.610 --> 25:18.880
I haven't quite worked
all that out yet, but...

25:20.480 --> 25:21.782
What the fuck?

25:27.054 --> 25:28.958
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

25:31.558 --> 25:32.827
Please don't hurt me!

25:36.131 --> 25:37.900
Please don't hurt me.

25:40.701 --> 25:42.136
What were you
trying to do?

25:42.903 --> 25:44.036
Huh?

25:44.038 --> 25:45.873
What were you
trying to do?

25:46.641 --> 25:48.207
I was trying to get out.

25:48.209 --> 25:50.343
What does it look like?

25:50.345 --> 25:52.579
You can't get out. Those
windows don't even open.

25:52.581 --> 25:53.947
What?

25:53.949 --> 25:55.682
Why'd you
board them up, then?

25:55.684 --> 25:57.216
I've had a really
hard day.

25:57.218 --> 25:59.753
And the last thing I need is for
you to pull shit like this.

25:59.755 --> 26:02.322
Oh, you've had
a hard day?

26:02.324 --> 26:06.427
You get to go out there
and do whatever you want,

26:06.429 --> 26:07.527
whenever you want.

26:07.529 --> 26:09.429
I? I am stuck here,

26:09.431 --> 26:11.198
all day long.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.168
And the only good part of my
day is when I go to sleep,

26:13.170 --> 26:16.137
because then, then I know that
I'm gonna make it till tomorrow.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.871
All right. For the last time.
I'm not trying to hurt you.

26:17.873 --> 26:19.440
I'm just trying to
take care of you.

26:19.442 --> 26:20.441
I think that's
pretty clear.

26:20.443 --> 26:22.209
- Take care of me?
- Yes.

26:22.211 --> 26:23.878
Look at me!

26:23.880 --> 26:26.413
I haven't had a shower
in forever.

26:26.415 --> 26:27.582
I smell like shit.

26:27.584 --> 26:29.719
Do you see how greasy
my hair is?

26:30.319 --> 26:31.585
Huh?

26:31.587 --> 26:33.657
There's only a sink
in that bathroom.

26:39.529 --> 26:41.596
I... I could give you soap.

26:41.598 --> 26:43.431
But, yeah, I didn't
think of that.

26:44.669 --> 26:46.835
I didn't think of that.
Just, you know...

26:46.837 --> 26:48.738
Yeah, it didn't occur to you
that while you were having

26:48.740 --> 26:50.573
your nice, warm,
little cozy showers

26:50.575 --> 26:52.141
that I might be
needing them, too?

26:52.143 --> 26:54.809
I've been very overwhelmed, and
I've been dealing with a lot,

26:54.811 --> 26:56.879
and a lot has happened really fast.

26:56.881 --> 26:59.216
So it has something
to do with that, probably.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.353
I don't care.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.085
When you think about
your needs,

27:03.087 --> 27:04.891
you need to try
and think about mine.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.364
All right, yeah.

27:12.530 --> 27:13.465
I'm sorry.

27:17.035 --> 27:17.970
I'm sorry.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.646
The best way to
get through your day

27:29.648 --> 27:31.649
is to focus on
the good things you have,

27:31.651 --> 27:32.853
not the bad.

27:36.289 --> 27:37.555
The seven steps.

27:37.557 --> 27:38.855
Who am I?
Where am I?

27:38.857 --> 27:39.824
Who am I with?

27:39.826 --> 27:40.791
What do I want?

27:40.793 --> 27:42.359
What do I do to get
what I want?

27:42.361 --> 27:44.430
And what just happened?
Okay?

27:45.397 --> 27:46.632
I am an enigma.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.933
You're an enigma?

27:48.935 --> 27:51.235
- I am an enigma.
- You're an enigma.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.805
You're nervous.

27:52.807 --> 27:53.806
I'm nervous?

27:53.808 --> 27:55.173
You're nervous.

27:55.175 --> 27:56.176
I'm nervous.

28:04.618 --> 28:05.919
Say something sexy.

28:08.489 --> 28:09.858
What time's the show?

28:10.358 --> 28:11.226
9:00.

28:13.294 --> 28:14.863
I'm really excited.

28:17.365 --> 28:20.532
Well, we're gonna be busy
shooting all night.

28:20.534 --> 28:21.901
I don't think
it'd be appropriate

28:21.903 --> 28:23.403
for me to bring
a girl along.

28:23.405 --> 28:26.505
I'll give you my credit card,
and you can walk around town.

28:26.507 --> 28:28.343
What am I gonna do
in Jersey?

28:30.311 --> 28:31.847
Is she pretty?

28:33.180 --> 28:34.615
She's a kid.

28:34.617 --> 28:38.985
The label picked her up from some
televised dance competition in Canada.

28:38.987 --> 28:40.553
Why? How old is she?

28:40.555 --> 28:42.292
I think she's 15.

28:42.859 --> 28:44.724
That's obscene.

28:44.726 --> 28:47.761
She has a career that you're
making a documentary about,

28:47.763 --> 28:50.167
and I'm like a total nobody.

28:50.632 --> 28:51.901
Come on.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.907
I have a pretty good friend
who's a talent rep,

28:59.909 --> 29:03.744
and I can introduce you
when we get back.

29:03.746 --> 29:05.182
He's a pretty
straight shooter.

29:09.887 --> 29:11.956
James, do you think of me
as your girlfriend?

29:13.823 --> 29:15.058
You want to be?

29:15.792 --> 29:17.061
Yeah.

29:54.900 --> 29:57.570
You're gonna have to let me cuff your
ankles if you're gonna go upstairs.

29:59.971 --> 30:01.340
I think that's ridiculous.

30:04.642 --> 30:07.945
Will you at least take these
off when I'm down here?

30:07.947 --> 30:09.979
It will be much easier for me
to maintain my sanity

30:09.981 --> 30:11.349
and to use the bathroom.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.316
We'll see.

30:12.318 --> 30:13.317
Come on.

30:13.319 --> 30:15.422
You've got a monitor
to watch me.

30:17.856 --> 30:18.992
Maybe.

30:21.995 --> 30:24.465
Well, can I at least
take them off while I shower?

30:26.098 --> 30:28.301
I'm not gonna run away
with my legs cuffed.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.476
Does it turn you on
to restrain me?

30:35.675 --> 30:36.644
Hmm?

30:59.233 --> 31:00.700
Does that record player work?

31:00.702 --> 31:01.636
Mm-hmm.

31:03.739 --> 31:05.007
Wow.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.243
This is a pretty big house.

31:12.013 --> 31:13.549
What, are you gonna
wash me now?

31:22.724 --> 31:24.924
You're locking the door
from the outside?

31:24.926 --> 31:26.128
Correct.

31:29.098 --> 31:31.635
How do I know you're not gonna
come in once I'm naked?

31:41.877 --> 31:43.045
Rosy?

31:44.880 --> 31:46.116
Rosy?

31:47.684 --> 31:49.116
Yes.

31:49.118 --> 31:51.987
Do I need to worry about
you killing yourself in there?

31:51.989 --> 31:54.559
I'm not suicidal,
arsehole.

32:02.299 --> 32:04.266
Is your grandmother coming?

32:04.268 --> 32:05.603
I don't know yet.

32:08.472 --> 32:12.274
Isn't she gonna wonder why all
the windows are boarded up?

32:12.276 --> 32:15.413
Um, I'll tell her that
the doctor ordered it.

32:16.613 --> 32:17.746
What do you mean?

32:17.748 --> 32:18.750
Is she sick?

32:24.121 --> 32:27.056
Well, how are you gonna
explain the handcuffed girl

32:27.058 --> 32:28.758
that's not allowed to
stroll the garden?

32:28.760 --> 32:30.362
You'll have to stay
downstairs.

32:30.928 --> 32:32.261
What about my baths?

32:32.263 --> 32:33.665
I'll figure it out.

32:39.170 --> 32:40.506
Also, Doug...

32:40.939 --> 32:42.074
Yes?

32:42.640 --> 32:45.041
I... I really appreciate

32:45.043 --> 32:47.276
the toothbrush and toothpaste
you gave me,

32:47.278 --> 32:49.612
and the horrific hairbrush.

32:49.614 --> 32:50.548
Mm-hmm.

32:50.550 --> 32:52.081
But since I'm gonna be
here for a while,

32:52.083 --> 32:54.685
I'm gonna need
a few more things.

32:54.687 --> 32:55.886
Like tampon.

32:55.888 --> 32:58.122
And I need my inhaler.

32:58.124 --> 33:00.190
I'd like a blowdryer,

33:00.192 --> 33:03.160
and I definitely need
more clothes,

33:03.162 --> 33:05.897
like a few pair of panties,
some shoes.

33:05.899 --> 33:07.831
Oh, some books
would be nice.

33:07.833 --> 33:09.766
My favorite author
is Mary McClain.

33:09.768 --> 33:13.071
And would it be possible
to get some makeup as well?

33:13.073 --> 33:16.373
Having reviewed the
personal and legal ramifications

33:16.375 --> 33:18.475
regarding the end
of life decision,

33:18.477 --> 33:22.214
let's now discuss the much
preferred alternative outcome,

33:22.216 --> 33:23.616
and the measures
you'll have to take

33:23.618 --> 33:26.418
if Katherine does indeed wake
up from her vegetative state.

33:26.420 --> 33:28.153
Which I personally
think could be any day now.

33:28.155 --> 33:30.956
One option is setting
her up in a nursing home.

33:30.958 --> 33:32.127
No.

33:36.096 --> 33:37.897
Well...

33:37.899 --> 33:40.166
if you'd rather
bring her home, I...

33:40.168 --> 33:43.068
I recommend that you hire
a caretaker or a nurse

33:43.070 --> 33:46.275
to administer her medication.

33:48.677 --> 33:50.813
Here's some information
you might find helpful.

33:51.613 --> 33:52.815
Basic preparations,

33:53.248 --> 33:54.549
expected costs.

33:56.184 --> 33:58.453
I'm seeing that girl
that I told you about.

34:01.823 --> 34:03.793
She's... She's...

34:05.259 --> 34:07.229
She's a handful.
But...

34:10.866 --> 34:12.335
I'm in love with her.

34:13.467 --> 34:16.172
I'm scared I'm not doing this
in the right way.

34:19.042 --> 34:20.643
I wish you could
tell me.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.295
Thank you for everything,
Dr. Godin.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.764
Are you sure

34:43.766 --> 34:46.737
you don't need some more
time to think this through?

34:47.804 --> 34:49.137
I've thought it through.

34:49.139 --> 34:50.407
Turn it off.

35:56.209 --> 35:57.945
Jesus! Could you knock?

36:01.013 --> 36:02.015
Sorry.

36:03.015 --> 36:04.318
What's wrong?

36:05.318 --> 36:06.720
My grandmother died.

36:07.153 --> 36:08.455
What?

36:10.458 --> 36:11.460
How?

36:13.161 --> 36:14.596
She got a stroke.

36:23.203 --> 36:24.472
What's the matter
with you?

36:28.743 --> 36:29.811
Nothing.

36:34.249 --> 36:35.985
So, do I still have to
stay down here?

36:36.651 --> 36:38.287
That's all you have to say?

36:38.887 --> 36:39.885
Really?

36:39.887 --> 36:41.988
I'd hug you, except that
you should probably

36:41.990 --> 36:43.890
think about the way
you're feeling right now

36:43.892 --> 36:46.296
is how my parents
are feeling about me.

36:47.796 --> 36:49.696
Wait, come back!

36:49.698 --> 36:51.330
Goddamn it!

37:00.710 --> 37:01.879
Are you okay?

37:05.315 --> 37:07.415
Look, I really

37:07.417 --> 37:09.717
wanted honestly to meet her.

37:09.719 --> 37:11.953
It's just I feel like
I'm suffocating down here.

37:11.955 --> 37:12.989
It's so dark.

37:14.324 --> 37:15.723
Have you never had
a feeling for someone

37:15.725 --> 37:17.393
from the second
you met them?

37:17.794 --> 37:19.192
Yes.

37:19.194 --> 37:21.161
But it has to be
both ways.

37:21.163 --> 37:23.701
How do you know if you never
get a chance to find out?

37:24.334 --> 37:25.534
What do you want?

37:25.536 --> 37:28.870
You wanna date me?
Here in the basement?

37:28.872 --> 37:32.844
I don't know what you call it,
but I just want a chance.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.445
Fine.

37:35.945 --> 37:37.081
But I want a chance, too.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.049
For what?

37:40.284 --> 37:41.586
Your trust.

37:45.890 --> 37:48.626
I don't wanna be stuck
down here all the time.

37:49.493 --> 37:51.493
We can hang out,

37:51.495 --> 37:52.997
but I wanna do it upstairs.

37:54.131 --> 37:55.964
Let me think about it.

37:55.966 --> 37:58.436
You can't have a relationship
without trust.

38:11.349 --> 38:13.652
So, have you ever
had a girlfriend?

38:15.454 --> 38:16.789
Uh...

38:17.255 --> 38:18.255
No.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.425
Why?

38:21.327 --> 38:22.696
I'm, uh...

38:23.563 --> 38:25.796
not the best at socializing,

38:25.798 --> 38:29.403
and I've just never met anyone
that I liked.

38:30.536 --> 38:32.873
So you've never done
anything like this before?

38:36.477 --> 38:37.678
You're doing it wrong.

38:39.912 --> 38:40.814
Can I do it?

38:41.982 --> 38:43.584
I love building fires.

38:44.051 --> 38:44.952
Okay.

38:46.118 --> 38:47.154
Sure.

38:55.796 --> 38:57.498
Do you have
a boyfriend?

39:00.235 --> 39:01.503
What if I did?

39:06.875 --> 39:10.510
There are other ways of meeting
people, you know, besides going out.

39:10.512 --> 39:12.844
It's not that simple
for me.

39:12.846 --> 39:16.184
I'm really far behind from where I
thought I'd be in my life by now.

39:18.686 --> 39:19.755
Me too.

39:21.523 --> 39:22.859
So what do you do?

39:23.725 --> 39:25.727
Uh, I work in a restaurant.

39:27.095 --> 39:29.798
So that's where you go
when you leave me here alone.

39:34.403 --> 39:37.207
My grandmother wanted me
to be with a nice girl.

39:42.176 --> 39:44.578
She could have survived,

39:44.580 --> 39:47.618
and I told them to
take her off life support.

39:48.552 --> 39:50.351
Why did you do that?

39:50.353 --> 39:52.786
If it were up to me, I would
have kept her alive, of course.

39:52.788 --> 39:55.158
But she wouldn't want to come
back like that. I know her.

39:58.261 --> 39:59.563
Then you did the right thing.

40:06.936 --> 40:07.904
Okay, good night.

40:09.941 --> 40:10.976
Also, Doug.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.341
Mm-hmm?

40:13.343 --> 40:16.010
Even though
we're very different,

40:16.012 --> 40:18.582
I do know what it's like
to feel alone.

40:22.887 --> 40:24.689
I've never done this before.

40:25.957 --> 40:26.892
What?

40:30.428 --> 40:31.830
Uh...

40:32.863 --> 40:36.769
You asked if I've never
done this before.

40:44.342 --> 40:45.645
Okay.

40:46.511 --> 40:47.813
Good night.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.618
Good night.

40:59.191 --> 41:00.793
I had an audition today.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.931
I think I made
a fool of myself.

41:06.499 --> 41:07.968
Aren't acting classes helping?

41:09.135 --> 41:10.237
Mm.

41:11.704 --> 41:13.740
It makes you feel guilty
about school.

41:15.907 --> 41:16.842
Why?

41:19.177 --> 41:20.313
I don't know,
I just...

41:21.814 --> 41:24.116
I just don't know
if I want it badly enough.

41:24.118 --> 41:25.951
Like, what's the point

41:25.953 --> 41:28.989
of racking up all this debt
in tuition?

41:29.890 --> 41:31.625
You know, it's gonna
get better.

41:33.359 --> 41:34.328
Well, I...

41:36.163 --> 41:38.032
What's the point?

41:44.303 --> 41:45.303
You done?

41:45.305 --> 41:46.374
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.987
You know, honey,
all you ever do is whine

42:00.989 --> 42:03.889
and have anxiety over
making it in the business.

42:03.891 --> 42:05.960
It's 99%
out of your control.

42:06.827 --> 42:08.162
That's not what I do.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.169
Did you read that book
I gave you?

42:15.604 --> 42:16.839
Not yet.

42:18.607 --> 42:19.976
Can I ask you something?

42:22.310 --> 42:23.212
Yes.

42:27.515 --> 42:29.582
Do you love me?

42:29.584 --> 42:31.186
I love spending time
with you.

42:36.625 --> 42:37.927
Do you love your wife?

42:40.963 --> 42:43.701
I've said "I love you"
in plenty of relationships.

42:45.634 --> 42:47.237
My problem is, uh...

42:49.873 --> 42:51.409
we eventually
get sick of people.

42:53.242 --> 42:55.311
That's a really
cynical thing to say.

42:59.649 --> 43:01.185
Why don't you get
sick of me?

43:38.690 --> 43:40.059
Come in.

44:10.324 --> 44:12.226
- Doug?
- Yes?

44:15.563 --> 44:16.898
Come here.

44:36.818 --> 44:38.521
You think you're
the guy for me?

44:39.588 --> 44:40.823
Mm-hmm.

44:43.691 --> 44:46.392
Then I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

44:46.394 --> 44:47.796
And we're gonna
find out.

44:49.097 --> 44:50.566
What do you mean
by that?

44:51.532 --> 44:53.401
You're gonna take me out
on a date.

44:53.901 --> 44:55.436
On a proper date.

44:56.704 --> 45:00.241
And we're gonna
talk to each other.

45:00.243 --> 45:03.243
And we're gonna
tell each other everything.

45:03.245 --> 45:05.948
And I want you
to get me something.

45:06.882 --> 45:08.482
A present.

45:08.484 --> 45:09.553
What kind of present?

45:10.386 --> 45:11.855
Stockings.

45:13.189 --> 45:14.891
The kind that

45:15.457 --> 45:17.893
come up to here.

45:20.596 --> 45:22.396
And that are
loose at the top.

45:22.398 --> 45:24.335
The vintage kind.

45:26.003 --> 45:28.239
And I want some garters
with them as well.

47:44.178 --> 47:45.315
Hi.

47:47.516 --> 47:48.616
Thank you.

47:48.618 --> 47:49.552
You're welcome.

47:55.290 --> 47:57.958
Sorry, my place is
such a mess.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.329
That's fine.

48:07.770 --> 48:11.743
Oh, I only covered that so that the
way that I looked is a surprise.

48:13.242 --> 48:15.112
I figured.
Don't worry about it.

48:17.014 --> 48:18.483
I knew why you did it.

48:21.318 --> 48:24.522
So... where are you
taking me?

48:25.555 --> 48:28.122
Uh, to the dining room.

48:28.124 --> 48:29.925
Ah! Fantastic.

48:29.927 --> 48:31.926
Never been.

48:48.212 --> 48:50.446
I do miss meat sometimes.

48:50.448 --> 48:52.750
Do you want a bite?
The cut here is fantastic.

48:55.486 --> 48:57.553
Okay. I'll try it.

48:57.555 --> 48:58.724
But don't tell anyone.

49:09.635 --> 49:11.104
Mmm.

49:11.836 --> 49:13.139
It's good.

49:15.541 --> 49:17.039
I just...

49:17.041 --> 49:19.276
I just love animals too much.

49:19.278 --> 49:21.980
Then you should definitely be
a proponent of meat eating,

49:21.982 --> 49:23.214
because once we
ruin our planet,

49:23.216 --> 49:24.915
we'll have to move
to another one.

49:24.917 --> 49:27.986
And the only thing that'll convince
people to make room for the animals

49:27.988 --> 49:29.556
is their chance
to eat them.

49:33.426 --> 49:35.162
So where do
your parents live?

49:37.663 --> 49:40.468
My father was never around
growing up, and my mother...

49:40.933 --> 49:42.202
killed herself.

49:42.669 --> 49:43.737
Why?

49:44.571 --> 49:46.374
I don't know.
I was very young.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.340
I think I'm lucky.

49:48.342 --> 49:49.941
It might have been
very painful otherwise.

49:49.943 --> 49:51.510
Hmm.

49:51.512 --> 49:54.246
My parents probably don't
even know that I'm missing.

49:54.248 --> 49:55.650
I doubt that.

49:57.585 --> 49:59.318
I mean,
they have some money.

49:59.320 --> 50:00.719
They're not filthy rich
or anything,

50:00.721 --> 50:04.190
but they could have
put me through school.

50:04.192 --> 50:07.362
I just... I just don't think
they like me very much.

50:08.128 --> 50:09.529
And to put it kindly,

50:09.531 --> 50:11.931
my mom is simple,
my father's a narcissist,

50:11.933 --> 50:14.634
so I've had to do
everything myself.

50:14.636 --> 50:16.506
And I find it
pretty exhausting.

50:25.013 --> 50:27.350
So, you think the police
are looking for me?

50:31.720 --> 50:32.922
Do you want them to be?

50:42.098 --> 50:43.467
You're a pretty good cook.

50:45.969 --> 50:47.934
Are you the chef
at your restaurant?

50:47.936 --> 50:51.038
Um, I'm sort of an everything man.
I'm a sous-chef,

50:51.040 --> 50:52.806
and I help serve.

50:52.808 --> 50:56.412
But my manager said that he'll
move me into the kitchen in time.

50:57.814 --> 50:59.684
What do you do?

51:01.818 --> 51:04.388
Oh... I'm an actress.

51:06.724 --> 51:08.923
- An actress?
- Mm-hmm.

51:08.925 --> 51:11.660
I can see that. You'd be a
really fantastic actress.

51:11.662 --> 51:14.198
I'd love to see your face
on a movie screen.

51:16.432 --> 51:17.334
Wow.

51:19.236 --> 51:20.801
I mean...

51:20.803 --> 51:23.273
Why don't you open
your own restaurant?

51:23.275 --> 51:26.412
You're too good of a cook
to just be serving people.

51:27.779 --> 51:29.982
I've just had a piece
of steak, for Christ sake.

51:30.815 --> 51:32.181
It's not that simple.

51:32.183 --> 51:36.052
Mm... Stealing a person
is not simple,

51:36.054 --> 51:38.221
yet you've done that.

51:38.223 --> 51:40.226
You just have to
want it badly enough.

51:40.625 --> 51:42.224
Fear is stupid.

51:42.226 --> 51:44.898
And so are most regrets.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.633
You know, I was scared
to take you at first,

51:50.635 --> 51:53.472
but then I thought, if it's
meant to be, it'll be.

51:56.575 --> 51:58.011
Well, you never tell me
I'm pretty.

51:59.512 --> 52:02.849
- Uh, I think you're...
- No, don't. Don't.

52:04.816 --> 52:08.117
Because if you say it now, it
means that you don't mean it.

52:08.119 --> 52:09.556
So it's not gonna count.

52:11.391 --> 52:13.461
You need to tell me
how to do these things.

52:15.261 --> 52:16.627
Okay.

52:16.629 --> 52:19.764
Not to be brash, but how
much money do you make?

52:19.766 --> 52:21.866
How far have you
thought this through?

52:21.868 --> 52:24.235
Are you gonna be able
to financially support me?

52:24.237 --> 52:26.337
Because if you're
gonna be my man,

52:26.339 --> 52:28.473
assuming that I'm not
gonna be able to work,

52:28.475 --> 52:30.611
and I really want children.

52:31.243 --> 52:32.345
Do you?

52:33.847 --> 52:35.847
Um...

52:35.849 --> 52:39.621
Well, I'm inheriting a good sum
of money from my grandmother.

52:40.787 --> 52:41.657
How much?

52:42.155 --> 52:43.324
Um...

52:44.124 --> 52:45.893
About $800,000.

52:47.795 --> 52:49.063
Wow, that's, uh...

52:49.930 --> 52:51.497
That's a lot.

52:51.499 --> 52:53.298
That's a seriously good life.

52:53.300 --> 52:54.969
Well, it's...

52:56.904 --> 52:58.508
Well, I'd rather have her.

53:02.810 --> 53:03.745
You know...

53:04.779 --> 53:06.883
I do believe that
you're a good guy.

53:08.216 --> 53:09.352
I am.

53:10.352 --> 53:11.721
I'm glad we're doing this.

53:16.158 --> 53:17.790
What do we do next?

53:17.792 --> 53:19.361
Mm. Well...

53:20.161 --> 53:21.796
Next you would fuck me.

53:21.798 --> 53:23.967
And then over the next few
weeks, you would fuck me again,

53:24.566 --> 53:25.733
and then you'd get bored,

53:25.735 --> 53:27.534
or you wouldn't want
to get serious,

53:27.536 --> 53:28.971
so you would just
start easing out.

53:34.476 --> 53:36.079
I'm never gonna
lose interest in you.

I have to tell you
something.

57:27.053 --> 57:28.922
So what's it like
being a hooker?

57:31.723 --> 57:34.558
Uh, I'm not a hooker.

57:34.560 --> 57:36.196

Um...

Rosy...

57:43.468 --> 57:44.771

57:45.706 --> 57:46.874
There you go.

57:50.911 --> 57:52.179
What do you
consider yourself?

57:56.817 --> 57:59.583
I'm more of a hostess,
I guess.

57:59.585 --> 58:01.820
You can pay me
for my company,

58:01.822 --> 58:03.755
or you don't have to
pay me at all,

58:03.757 --> 58:07.059
but I appreciate
the encouragement.

58:07.061 --> 58:09.294
You could pay for
a class or something

58:09.296 --> 58:10.863
if you believe in me.

58:10.865 --> 58:15.069
And if you don't like me walking home
alone at night, you can buy me a car.

58:16.104 --> 58:17.640
Sounds like a hooker to me.

58:19.540 --> 58:21.006
Is it, though?

58:21.008 --> 58:24.743
Because I'm not necessarily
gong to sleep with a person.

58:24.745 --> 58:26.981
Not unless they make it
worth your while?

58:29.917 --> 58:31.417
No.

58:31.419 --> 58:34.021
I only go out with the men
I want to go out with,

58:34.023 --> 58:37.523
and I only sleep with
the men I want to sleep with,

58:37.525 --> 58:39.795
whether or not
they're giving me gifts.

58:41.864 --> 58:44.134
What's the most you made
in one night?

58:52.607 --> 58:54.108
Ten grand.

58:55.478 --> 58:56.910
Really?

58:56.912 --> 58:59.182
Wow! What did you have to do
to deserve that?

59:00.450 --> 59:01.850
Okay.

59:01.852 --> 59:03.618
I don't wanna do this
anymore.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.718
Rosy, take a seat.

59:04.720 --> 59:06.956
You wanted to do this.
Let's do it.

59:07.591 --> 59:08.759
Please.

59:09.725 --> 59:11.693
All I want is to be with you.

59:11.695 --> 59:13.030
Rosy...

59:15.465 --> 59:17.434
- Come on.
- Why not?

59:18.234 --> 59:19.303
I pay you.

59:19.936 --> 59:21.603
What I like about this

59:21.605 --> 59:25.507
is that we don't have to worry
about what it's gonna become.

59:25.509 --> 59:28.212
But you left your wife
for me.

59:29.614 --> 59:31.614
I'm sorry.

59:31.616 --> 59:34.820
That didn't have anything
to do with us.

59:40.891 --> 59:43.728
I can't take you home
to meet my daughter.

59:47.298 --> 59:48.735
Do you understand me?

59:53.639 --> 59:54.740
No.

59:55.606 --> 59:56.842
Look...

01:00:07.519 --> 01:00:08.822
Why do you do it?

01:00:10.256 --> 01:00:11.458
Because I can.

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.058
Right now, everything
is open to you,

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.694
but you're not
choosing anything.

01:00:17.696 --> 01:00:19.532
You're just waiting
to be chosen.

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:22.266
As an actress,

01:00:22.268 --> 01:00:25.205
as whatever else
that you're out there doing.

01:00:57.705 --> 01:00:58.908
Okay.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.009
I'm leaving.

01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:03.244
Rosy, wait.

01:01:05.413 --> 01:01:07.516
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

01:01:13.888 --> 01:01:14.989
No.

01:01:23.932 --> 01:01:28.905
Just before you go,
put these on.

01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:31.070
I don't need them.

01:01:31.072 --> 01:01:32.341
They make me feel better.

01:01:33.275 --> 01:01:35.541
We've taken
a huge step forward.

01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:38.114
Me putting those on would
just be going backwards.

01:01:39.282 --> 01:01:40.383
Please.

01:01:42.451 --> 01:01:45.122
Why didn't you ask me out
in the first place?

01:01:48.825 --> 01:01:50.627
You would have never
given me a chance.

01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:52.330
Mm.

01:01:54.397 --> 01:01:55.466
What's wrong?

01:01:58.968 --> 01:02:00.337
You're being weird.

01:02:02.906 --> 01:02:05.308
Are you upset
about what I told you?

01:02:07.276 --> 01:02:08.211
No.

01:02:12.784 --> 01:02:14.186
What's wrong, then?

01:02:19.623 --> 01:02:21.190
What are other men like?

01:02:21.192 --> 01:02:22.527
What did they make
you do?

01:02:25.996 --> 01:02:27.665
Did anyone ever hurt you?

01:02:32.771 --> 01:02:35.575
Look,
it's in the past.

01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:50.290
You are upset.

01:02:51.823 --> 01:02:55.392
It's not the easiest thing
to swallow.

01:02:55.394 --> 01:02:57.328
You must have been going
through some pretty hard stuff

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:59.998
to go through
something like that.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.467
I don't know. I just...

01:03:02.768 --> 01:03:04.534
It's a lot for me to process
right now.

01:03:05.804 --> 01:03:07.040
Fuck you!

01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:09.643
Rosy!

01:03:12.846 --> 01:03:15.349
Damn it, Rosy!
Get the fuck back here!

01:03:18.618 --> 01:03:19.750
Ow!

01:03:29.963 --> 01:03:31.629
Wait! Wait!

01:03:31.631 --> 01:03:33.300
Please!

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:36.037
Help!

01:03:39.939 --> 01:03:41.208
No!

01:03:50.752 --> 01:03:51.754
Help!

01:04:21.818 --> 01:04:22.916
Help!

01:04:22.918 --> 01:04:24.487
Help! Help!

01:04:28.423 --> 01:04:30.494
- No!
- Shh!

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.370
I trusted you.

01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:43.237
No, you didn't.

01:04:43.239 --> 01:04:44.575
Flat or sparkling?

01:04:45.142 --> 01:04:46.576
Sparkling, please.

01:04:48.912 --> 01:04:50.781
You look fetching.

01:04:56.653 --> 01:04:57.789
You know that guy?

01:04:58.722 --> 01:04:59.690
Who?

01:05:00.657 --> 01:05:03.325
The guy right over there
who you just looked at.

01:05:03.327 --> 01:05:05.431
I, uh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:05:06.097 --> 01:05:07.796
Oh, so that's a yes.

01:05:07.798 --> 01:05:09.831
Here's the menus
for you.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:11.867
- Thank you.
- Here you go, miss.

01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:13.072
Thank you.

01:05:23.314 --> 01:05:24.614
- Oh! Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa!

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:26.517
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:05:26.519 --> 01:05:27.984
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

01:05:27.986 --> 01:05:29.752
Don't worry.
Accidents happen, and...

01:05:29.754 --> 01:05:32.189
You know what? I love the
sound of breaking glass.

01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:33.589
I'll get someone
to clean that up.

01:05:33.591 --> 01:05:35.459
I also like the sound
of breaking glass.

01:05:35.461 --> 01:05:37.529
What the fuck does that mean?

01:05:38.096 --> 01:05:39.328
I'm so sorry.

01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:41.300
Just get some stuff
to clean this up, please.

01:05:44.704 --> 01:05:45.836
What's wrong?

01:05:45.838 --> 01:05:47.338
Can I take you
somewhere else?

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.106
This place is ridiculous.

01:05:49.108 --> 01:05:51.545
Why? I like this place.

01:05:53.547 --> 01:05:55.749
You're just jealous
that my ex is here.

01:05:57.317 --> 01:05:59.887
An ex isn't the same thing
as a client.

01:06:01.788 --> 01:06:03.389
He wasn't my client.

01:06:03.822 --> 01:06:05.657
He's my ex.

01:06:05.659 --> 01:06:08.627
Why did you pretend
not to know him?

01:06:08.629 --> 01:06:11.133
Because I knew that
you would be upset.

01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:14.669
Great.
An escort and an actress.

01:06:14.968 --> 01:06:16.135
Hey!

01:06:16.137 --> 01:06:18.203
Either I'm paranoid
or I'm right.

01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:20.039
Now you look jealous.

01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:21.809
That just means
that you care.

01:06:23.644 --> 01:06:26.111
No, I'm not jealous.

01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:28.750
And there's nothing
to talk about. It's fine.

01:06:29.783 --> 01:06:30.982
- Really?
- Really.

01:06:30.984 --> 01:06:32.154
It's fine?

01:06:33.855 --> 01:06:35.154
Fine.

01:06:35.156 --> 01:06:36.391
What's his name?

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.659
Peter.

01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:43.862
Why don't we invite Peter over
here to join us for dinner?

01:06:43.864 --> 01:06:45.063
Stop.

01:06:45.065 --> 01:06:46.565
If he's not a client,
then what's the big deal?

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:47.701
Why are you always
being so horrible to me?

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.969
He's your friend.
You guys should talk.

01:06:49.971 --> 01:06:51.271
- Catch up.
- No. No.

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:52.938
- Peter?
- Seriously?

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.343
Peter. Look, I didn't realize
you were a good pal of Rosy's,

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:58.546
and why don't you come over
here and join us for a drink?

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.350
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.253
I'm really sorry.

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.897
Please! I didn't mean to.

01:07:17.899 --> 01:07:19.300
I didn't mean to do this.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.703
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry!

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.908
I'm so sorry. Please.

01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:51.099
You really did clip yourself.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:54.637
I think you should wait a while
before you go back to chopping wood.

01:07:54.639 --> 01:07:57.807
Is there any way I could take
off a few more dinner services?

01:07:57.809 --> 01:08:01.611
I don't have time for people
who don't take work seriously.

01:08:01.613 --> 01:08:03.845
I just don't feel like this
is what I wanna keep doing,

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:07.149
and when you hired me, you said that
you'd work me up to being a cook.

01:08:07.151 --> 01:08:10.853
Yeah. Well, considering how things have
been going for the past couple of months,

01:08:10.855 --> 01:08:12.422
that's pretty rich.

01:08:12.424 --> 01:08:13.993
Sir, I think I quit.

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:17.696
<i>Doug.</i>

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:19.499
<i>Doug.</i>

01:08:20.066 --> 01:08:20.934
<i>Doug.</i>

01:08:22.067 --> 01:08:23.969
<i>I can explain everything.</i>

01:08:25.069 --> 01:08:26.372
Look at me, Doug.

01:09:12.853 --> 01:09:14.219
Oi!

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:17.154
I'm here! You can't
ignore me forever!

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:20.629
I'm gonna scream
all day long!

01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:24.701
Fuck!

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:27.401
Fuck you! Fuck!

01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:30.469
Come on!

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.205
Why don't you grow
some balls for once!

01:09:33.207 --> 01:09:34.609
You're gonna listen to me!

01:09:35.711 --> 01:09:37.977
You motherfucking arsehole!

01:10:15.084 --> 01:10:16.652
Who were you
talking to?

01:10:16.654 --> 01:10:19.857
Oh. I...

01:10:22.793 --> 01:10:25.359
All right. Let me see your hand.
Let me see your hand.

01:10:28.965 --> 01:10:33.104
Please. Please help me. I have a fever.
I'm not feeling very well.

01:10:33.804 --> 01:10:35.073
I need help.

01:10:35.506 --> 01:10:36.908
I need a doctor.

01:10:39.244 --> 01:10:40.813
Please.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:46.986
Rosy...

01:10:49.019 --> 01:10:50.054
Rosy...

01:10:59.332 --> 01:11:00.897
Rosy. Rosy?

01:11:05.738 --> 01:11:09.476
You like the sound
of breaking glass.

01:11:15.515 --> 01:11:16.914
All right,
if I get you a doctor,

01:11:16.916 --> 01:11:18.516
you gotta play along
that you're my girlfriend, okay?

01:11:18.518 --> 01:11:20.384
There's gonna be some
serious issues.

01:11:20.386 --> 01:11:23.522
I am your fucking girlfriend!

01:11:39.206 --> 01:11:42.043
Hey, hey, hey! What the
hell's the matter with you?

01:11:45.879 --> 01:11:48.447
Doug? What the hell
are you doing?

01:11:48.449 --> 01:11:50.949
You scared...
You scared me half to death.

01:11:50.951 --> 01:11:52.484
I really need your help
with something.

01:11:52.486 --> 01:11:54.086
It's a medical thing.

01:11:54.088 --> 01:11:55.955
And, uh...

01:11:55.957 --> 01:11:57.124
It's my girlfriend.

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:21.951
Hello.

01:12:24.152 --> 01:12:25.153
Hello there.

01:12:25.653 --> 01:12:26.986
I'm Dr. Godin.

01:12:26.988 --> 01:12:28.023
Hi.

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:30.026
I'm Rosy.

01:12:31.026 --> 01:12:32.563
Are you all right, Rosy?

01:12:33.563 --> 01:12:36.033
Uh, let's see
what we have here.

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.205
Ah, well, this...

01:12:42.772 --> 01:12:45.973
This is terribly infected.

01:12:45.975 --> 01:12:49.509
Why haven't you brought this
girl to the hospital, Doug?

01:12:49.511 --> 01:12:51.279
This is very serious.

01:12:51.281 --> 01:12:52.917
- Um...
- I didn't wanna go.

01:12:53.282 --> 01:12:54.285
I refused.

01:12:55.218 --> 01:12:56.755
I'm afraid of hospitals.

01:12:58.154 --> 01:13:00.254
And I don't have insurance.

01:13:00.256 --> 01:13:05.193
Well, you know, infections are
the leading cause of death in this country.

01:13:05.195 --> 01:13:06.898
You don't wanna
lose this leg.

01:13:07.198 --> 01:13:08.166
Mm-mmm.

01:13:09.833 --> 01:13:11.500
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:13:11.502 --> 01:13:13.038
We're gonna take care of it.

01:13:14.771 --> 01:13:18.676
What... What exactly
happened here?

01:13:19.443 --> 01:13:21.047
I slipped in the forest.

01:13:21.579 --> 01:13:22.711
Yeah.

01:13:22.713 --> 01:13:23.982
Oh.

01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:26.549
Are you afraid of needles too?

01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:27.651
No.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:28.954
Hold that.

01:13:29.654 --> 01:13:30.956
All right.

01:13:38.062 --> 01:13:39.328
All right.

01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:40.365
Deep breath.

01:13:47.539 --> 01:13:49.039
There.

01:13:49.041 --> 01:13:50.106
I'll take that.

01:13:50.108 --> 01:13:51.344
Oh, what...

01:13:52.745 --> 01:13:54.948
What are the bruises
on your wrists from?

01:13:55.981 --> 01:13:57.049
Sex.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:13:59.018
It's from sex.

01:14:01.987 --> 01:14:05.092
How long
have you two been together?

01:14:06.592 --> 01:14:07.795
Uh, a few months.

01:14:09.329 --> 01:14:10.628
But we're very serious.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:14.365
Well, my wife and I
got engaged

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:15.937
after five months.

01:14:18.405 --> 01:14:20.041
- Are you still together?
- Oh...

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:23.208
Nineteen years
this June.

01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:25.444
Ain't it the happiest years
of my life?

01:14:25.446 --> 01:14:26.714
It's a joke.

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:28.547
I was just joking.

01:14:28.549 --> 01:14:29.850
The love of my life.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.752
She is the love
of my life.

01:14:32.754 --> 01:14:33.785
Do you have children?

01:14:33.787 --> 01:14:36.489
Yes, two daughters
and my boy.

01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:37.990
Rosy wants children.

01:14:37.992 --> 01:14:40.560
Most women do.

01:14:40.562 --> 01:14:43.663
I am going to write
some prescriptions

01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:46.465
for you to pick up
right away.

01:14:46.467 --> 01:14:47.834
What is your last name, Rosy?

01:14:47.836 --> 01:14:50.069
Is there any way you could
just make them out to me

01:14:50.071 --> 01:14:52.405
instead of her?
Because my pharmacist is

01:14:52.407 --> 01:14:55.675
really crazy about letting me pick
up medication that's not mine.

01:14:55.677 --> 01:14:57.243
- Uh...
- Yes.

01:14:57.245 --> 01:14:58.579
And I can't go,

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:00.083
because I'm too ill.

01:15:01.316 --> 01:15:02.718
I can't walk.

01:15:03.351 --> 01:15:04.720
I really can't do that.

01:15:05.386 --> 01:15:06.585
Last name?

01:15:06.587 --> 01:15:08.691
It's not a big deal. You could
just make it out to me.

01:15:09.624 --> 01:15:10.827
Just do it.

01:15:11.627 --> 01:15:13.160
Just do it.

01:15:13.162 --> 01:15:15.094
I'll tell you what.

01:15:15.096 --> 01:15:19.433
If they give you a problem,
you just give me a call.

01:15:19.435 --> 01:15:20.969
All right?
What is your last name?

01:15:20.971 --> 01:15:22.470
Well, she actually
took my last name,

01:15:22.472 --> 01:15:25.810
'cause we just got married and
we haven't told anybody yet.

01:15:27.043 --> 01:15:28.813
You know,
break the big news.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.015
Well...

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.819
congratulations.

01:15:35.685 --> 01:15:37.053
That's great.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:41.025
So, Rose Landver?

01:15:41.624 --> 01:15:43.626
Rosy Lanver.

01:15:43.628 --> 01:15:46.098
- Landver.
- Landver.

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:49.267
Landver.

01:15:50.601 --> 01:15:51.836
All right.

01:16:01.411 --> 01:16:02.513
Just let it ring.

01:16:07.586 --> 01:16:08.821
All right.

01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:11.256
Here we go.

01:16:11.889 --> 01:16:14.391
You ready to drive me back?

01:16:14.393 --> 01:16:15.859
What is that on your pad?

01:16:15.861 --> 01:16:17.660
- What?
- I just saw something written on your pad.

01:16:17.662 --> 01:16:19.297
I just... I...

01:16:20.532 --> 01:16:22.201
Prescription receipt.

01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:25.668
Shall we... Shall we go?

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:26.872
Yeah, Dr. Godin?

01:16:27.538 --> 01:16:28.808
Yeah, Doug.

01:16:30.742 --> 01:16:32.146
Can I ask you something?

01:16:32.979 --> 01:16:34.515
- Shoot.
- Here's...

01:16:48.728 --> 01:16:50.230
Do you think I'm a strange guy?

01:16:53.399 --> 01:16:55.369
I do, as a matter of fact.

01:16:58.038 --> 01:16:59.438
Do you think there's
something wrong with me?

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.542
Should I see a therapist?

01:17:01.875 --> 01:17:04.742
Would you like me to
recommend you someone?

01:17:04.744 --> 01:17:05.979
Um...

01:17:06.646 --> 01:17:07.712
I mean, I just...

01:17:07.714 --> 01:17:09.583
I want you to guess
what's my issue.

01:17:11.651 --> 01:17:13.354
I really couldn't say.

01:17:14.922 --> 01:17:16.889
I'm happy to refer you
to someone...

01:17:16.891 --> 01:17:19.425
I have this fear of what
people are thinking of me

01:17:19.427 --> 01:17:23.596
and I have things like just this
fucking spirals of thought.

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:25.331
And, uh...

01:17:25.333 --> 01:17:28.467
And it just happens to me every time
I leave the house every fucking day.

01:17:28.469 --> 01:17:30.203
This really fucks me up.

01:17:30.205 --> 01:17:32.074
I'm just trying to
figure out what it is.

01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:37.012
I'll find you someone good.

01:17:40.949 --> 01:17:42.183
Dr. Godin...

01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:44.521
Yeah?

01:17:47.924 --> 01:17:50.391
You got any
marriage advice for us?

01:17:50.393 --> 01:17:52.959
Oh...

01:17:52.961 --> 01:17:55.264
They say it helps
to have a short memory.

01:17:56.432 --> 01:17:58.868
Mm-hmm. Anything else
besides that?

01:18:01.202 --> 01:18:02.238
Honestly...

01:18:03.539 --> 01:18:04.608
I think, uh,

01:18:05.774 --> 01:18:09.145
the most important thing
I have learned is

01:18:10.212 --> 01:18:13.848
relationship is hard work.

01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:15.119
How do you mean?

01:18:15.585 --> 01:18:16.921
Uh, people...

01:18:18.689 --> 01:18:22.927
You know, people expect
love to make things easy.

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:24.395
Life's not easy.

01:18:25.628 --> 01:18:29.132
But it feels good
when you...

01:18:33.236 --> 01:18:37.242
get through
hard stuff together.

01:18:40.177 --> 01:18:41.345
So...

01:18:42.814 --> 01:18:43.981
Thank you.

01:18:45.749 --> 01:18:47.386
Thanks. Thank you.

01:18:49.052 --> 01:18:52.925
Really. I have to
go home now.

01:18:56.027 --> 01:18:58.063
After you. Let's go.

01:19:04.703 --> 01:19:06.239
Take care, Rosy.

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.080
Doug...

01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:16.415
Doug!

01:19:20.853 --> 01:19:22.520
Hey, Doc.
One more thing.

01:19:22.522 --> 01:19:23.520
Yeah?

01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:36.967
What have you done?

01:19:36.969 --> 01:19:38.368
You see what you did?

01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.637
- What did I do?
- You tried to fuck me over again.

01:19:40.639 --> 01:19:42.172
What are you
talking about?

01:19:42.174 --> 01:19:43.609
You tried to turn me in.

01:19:43.611 --> 01:19:44.509
No, I didn't.

01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:46.011
It says "captive"
on one of these papers.

01:19:46.013 --> 01:19:48.246
I saw, you wrote "captive"
on one of these papers,

01:19:48.248 --> 01:19:50.048
and it's somewhere in here
and I'm gonna find it.

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:52.151
No, I didn't.

01:19:52.153 --> 01:19:53.418
Where is it?
What did he do with it?

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.753
Where is it? Where is it?

01:21:14.338 --> 01:21:16.174
I need you to help me
bury the body.

01:21:20.245 --> 01:21:21.845
Does anyone know
that he came here?

01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:27.016
One, two, three...

01:21:27.018 --> 01:21:28.654
Up, up.

01:21:35.859 --> 01:21:37.994
All right, listen.
I'm sorry

01:21:37.996 --> 01:21:39.928
about what happened
with me and you.

01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.497
I got really upset,

01:21:41.499 --> 01:21:44.500
because you said that you needed
to process what I told you.

01:21:44.502 --> 01:21:45.637
What?

01:21:47.038 --> 01:21:50.107
Which means you,
you don't trust me.

01:21:50.109 --> 01:21:52.409
And I, I am
a trustworthy person.

01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:54.544
You hit me in the head
with an ax.

01:21:54.546 --> 01:21:56.812
- No. technically I...
- Yeah, yeah. You did.

01:21:56.814 --> 01:21:58.382
You hit me straight in
in the head with an ax.

01:21:58.384 --> 01:22:00.950
No, I jabbed you in the head
with the ax handle.

01:22:00.952 --> 01:22:03.419
I know. Wrong move.

01:22:03.421 --> 01:22:05.989
It's just I got over-anxious and
I jumped the gun. I'm sorry.

01:22:05.991 --> 01:22:07.325
What are you talking about?

01:22:07.327 --> 01:22:08.725
How could you
do this to me?

01:22:08.727 --> 01:22:10.995
My brain tells me to run,
and my heart tells me to stay.

01:22:10.997 --> 01:22:14.499
I mean, how do you expect me to
navigate a situation like this?

01:22:14.501 --> 01:22:16.166
Keep your
fucking voice down.

01:22:16.168 --> 01:22:18.202
It's just I have to wait
for you to be ready.

01:22:18.204 --> 01:22:20.237
I just...

01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:25.108
felt that I had come so far,
and then you rejected me!

01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:27.812
I also felt that you
judged me about my past.

01:22:27.814 --> 01:22:28.746
I never judged you.

01:22:28.748 --> 01:22:29.781
That's your issue.

01:22:29.783 --> 01:22:31.216
You said that
you had to process things

01:22:31.218 --> 01:22:32.850
before you knew
if you could still love me.

01:22:32.852 --> 01:22:37.758
No, I needed to process the
idea that you could actually love me.

01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:53.441
Uh... I'm not this
kind of person.

01:22:55.777 --> 01:23:00.183
- I know.
- I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

01:23:01.683 --> 01:23:02.785
I'm just...

01:23:04.385 --> 01:23:05.718
I'm just a guy who...

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:09.659
who, you know, has a really
hard time with things.

01:23:11.026 --> 01:23:12.124
And...

01:23:12.126 --> 01:23:15.328
It's okay.
Come on, just...

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:16.829
Just cry and get it over with.

01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:17.767
Uh...

01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:41.858
Doug...

01:23:48.998 --> 01:23:50.367
Did you ever like me?

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:54.472
Yes.

01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.809
I love you.

01:24:25.035 --> 01:24:26.971
Fuck!

01:24:28.205 --> 01:24:30.575
Rosy!

01:24:32.977 --> 01:24:34.013
Rosy!

01:24:37.849 --> 01:24:40.283
Oh, here we go again!

01:24:40.285 --> 01:24:42.552
Round and round we go!

01:24:42.554 --> 01:24:44.121
Why am I not surprised?

01:24:44.123 --> 01:24:46.155
Another time you
stabbed me in the back!

01:24:46.157 --> 01:24:48.958
You stabbed me
in the fucking back.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.560
I saw your gun!

01:24:50.562 --> 01:24:52.298
You were gonna shoot me.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.866
Oh, that's right.

01:24:55.868 --> 01:24:59.303
Everything is a reaction
to what I do, huh?

01:24:59.305 --> 01:25:00.808
It's all my fault.

01:25:02.142 --> 01:25:04.444
It's all my fault!

01:25:06.545 --> 01:25:07.647
Rosy!

01:25:10.216 --> 01:25:11.882
Rosy.

01:25:11.884 --> 01:25:13.853
You know, I like it
when you hurt me.

01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:18.522
I like it because it makes me
less and less attracted to you,

01:25:18.524 --> 01:25:20.825
which makes this
a whole lot easier for me.

01:25:20.827 --> 01:25:22.762
Because you're not
who I thought you were.

01:25:22.764 --> 01:25:24.897
You know, the police won't
stop calling me.

01:25:24.899 --> 01:25:27.366
I killed a guy for you,
he's in the ground.

01:25:27.368 --> 01:25:28.467
I did that for you.

01:25:28.469 --> 01:25:31.337
I even killed
my grandmother for you.

01:25:31.339 --> 01:25:33.406
And you broke my heart!

01:25:33.408 --> 01:25:35.241
You broke my heart!

01:25:35.243 --> 01:25:37.575
And even though
you broke my heart,

01:25:37.577 --> 01:25:40.713
I can't stop
thinking about you.

01:25:40.715 --> 01:25:42.948
I cannot sleep,
I cannot eat.

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:44.417
I can't do anything.

01:25:44.419 --> 01:25:46.152
I'm a mess.

01:25:46.154 --> 01:25:47.586
I'm in love with you!

01:25:47.588 --> 01:25:48.990
I'm in love with you.

01:25:50.292 --> 01:25:51.593
Goddamn it.

01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:02.472
I knew what you were
doing with those men.

01:26:03.204 --> 01:26:05.140
I looked you up.
I followed you.

01:26:06.675 --> 01:26:09.045
I just wanted to
protect you from yourself.

01:26:11.481 --> 01:26:12.950
I knew that I would
never hurt you.

01:26:15.285 --> 01:26:16.687
Ah, fuck.

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:23.491
I deserve better
than all of this!

01:26:23.493 --> 01:26:25.626
You don't care
about me.

01:26:25.628 --> 01:26:27.865
You just took me
for yourself.

01:26:28.697 --> 01:26:31.035
You don't give a shit
about my life.

01:26:32.503 --> 01:26:33.838
Did you like your life?

01:26:34.938 --> 01:26:37.441
Oh! How dare you?

01:26:39.543 --> 01:26:41.179
I'm still figuring it all out.

01:26:42.112 --> 01:26:43.081
Just shoot me.

01:26:44.948 --> 01:26:45.916
Do it.

01:26:48.117 --> 01:26:49.117
Shoot me.

01:26:49.119 --> 01:26:50.785
You sorry...

01:27:03.367 --> 01:27:05.004
I love you, Rosy.

01:27:13.345 --> 01:27:14.613
You ready?

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.517
Mm-hmm.

01:27:22.616 --> 01:27:27.616
