(sirens wailing)

00:16.058 --> 00:19.667
Shares at lancaster holdings
dropped 62 percent today

00:19.937 --> 00:23.513
After a court awarded former
lancaster employee vera quaid

00:23.774 --> 00:26.700
$10 million
in a sexual harassment judgment

00:26.777 --> 00:30.437
Against ceo roger lancaster.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.657
(grunting, smashing)

00:42.835 --> 00:44.918
Mr. Lancaster, I need you
to open this door

00:45.129 --> 00:53.594
And vacate the premises
immediately.

00:53.763 --> 00:54.702
(banging on door)

00:54.889 --> 00:58.465
Mr. Lancaster, you have
five seconds to comply.

00:58.601 --> 00:59.466
Five,

00:59.602 --> 01:01.435
Four,

01:01.595 --> 01:02.819
Three,

01:02.855 --> 01:03.378
Two...

01:03.481 --> 01:05.547
...One!

01:05.649 --> 01:08.734

01:26.295 --> 01:27.436

01:27.505 --> 01:28.845
When I was younger,

01:28.964 --> 01:31.322
I used to wish every night
for a sister.

01:31.550 --> 01:35.769
For now, I have more sisters
than I ever thought possible.

01:35.888 --> 01:39.597
But tonight, myself
and my fellow sisters

01:39.683 --> 01:42.192
Will form a special bond
with the new pledges

01:42.353 --> 01:45.937
We've picked to be
our official little sisters.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.530
On my signal, run upstairs

01:47.691 --> 01:49.440
And find the door
with your name on it.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.335
Behind the door will be
your big sister

01:51.487 --> 01:54.779
Who has picked you to be
her little for life.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.691
Ready, set...

01:57.868 --> 02:00.785
Go, thetas!

02:00.787 --> 02:01.829
(laughter)

02:02.039 --> 02:08.877
Guys, come on, let's go!

02:09.046 --> 02:12.405
(knocking)

02:12.550 --> 02:15.776
(screaming)

02:15.886 --> 02:17.560
I'm so happy you picked me!

02:17.596 --> 02:18.862
I adore you!

02:19.014 --> 02:20.514
Besides, you're the only girl
in the house

02:20.724 --> 02:22.015
Who doesn't make fun of me
when I play

02:22.226 --> 02:23.550
My mom's old van halen vinyls.

02:23.686 --> 02:32.559
Come on!

02:32.862 --> 02:35.303
Is that the reason you like me,
because I know the difference

02:35.447 --> 02:37.381
Between david lee roth
and sammy hagar?

02:37.491 --> 02:40.058
That, and you remind me
of myself

02:40.202 --> 02:41.401
When I first joined theta.

02:41.579 --> 02:42.952
I can tell
you're not really sure

02:43.038 --> 02:48.575
What this whole
sisterhood thing means.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.911
They're trust bands.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.246
One for you...

02:53.382 --> 02:54.856
And one for me.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.218
That way, we know we'll always
have each other's backs.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.252
(phone ringing)

02:59.430 --> 03:00.721
Oh, hang on.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.439
(phone ringing)

03:02.474 --> 03:04.015
Hey, wally.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.493
Yeah, I'm here
with my new little.

03:06.604 --> 03:09.504
No, not jessica,
it's winter.

03:09.732 --> 03:14.359
"fifteen years ago, vera quaid
took down a business empire."

03:14.361 --> 03:15.343
(kaylee sighs)

03:15.446 --> 03:16.069
Sorry about that.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.404
My boyfriend plays baseball,

03:17.615 --> 03:18.621
And he just got back, so...

03:18.699 --> 03:20.574
Is your mother vera quaid?

03:20.743 --> 03:22.242
The one and only.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.077
Do we look too self-righteous?

03:24.330 --> 03:26.446
It's just a preview issue,
it comes out next week.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.631
Do you think she'd sign
a copy for me?

03:28.751 --> 03:30.041
Your mom was
the #metoo movement

03:30.127 --> 03:31.601
Before anyone
even used hashtags.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.937
We read about her in my
women's studies class last week.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.756
Yeah, I'm sure
I could introduce you guys.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.441
She lives here in louisville.

03:37.635 --> 03:39.809
That is, if I can ever get her
to actually come visit.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.370
Hello, did everyone forget
about the ice cream social

03:42.556 --> 03:43.797
We're hosting
for the new littles?

03:43.974 --> 03:45.131
That's right.
Come on, winter.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.709
There's one problem:
No ice cream.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.319
Shoot, I forgot to buy some.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.121
That's why we need
a new house mom asap.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.048
The kitchen's been falling apart
ever since liz left last month.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.992
Yeah, I know,
the advisory board swore

03:56.153 --> 03:58.278
That they'd have a new house mom
for us any day now.

03:58.489 --> 04:00.330
Let's just go out
for ice cream instead.

04:00.449 --> 04:05.118
Okay, but not before winter
opens this!

04:05.371 --> 04:07.504
This will help you deal
with certain expectations

04:07.665 --> 04:10.999
We have for you
now that kaylee is your big.

04:15.305 --> 04:16.830
(laughing)

04:16.966 --> 04:18.923
Ha-ha.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.866
Good one.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.001
Come on, oh my god.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.486
Are you guys making fun of me?

04:22.596 --> 04:24.337
No, she's making fun of me.

04:24.622 --> 04:27.616
The cradle-robbing jokes
are getting a little old.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.583
Are they?

04:28.686 --> 04:29.859
(laughing)

04:30.062 --> 04:32.996
Look, we're all expecting you
to follow in kaylee's footsteps

04:33.065 --> 04:34.347
And date someone younger too.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.033
Um, if I did that,
it would be illegal.

04:37.194 --> 04:42.172
No, pay this evil, jealous,
and sad woman no mind.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.858
Besides, wally isn't even
that much younger than me.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.159
How old is he?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.178
He's only 18 years old?

04:48.289 --> 04:50.605
Mom, he's more than his age.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.465
He's on a baseball scholarship,

04:52.543 --> 04:54.667
And we're both pre-law.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.027
He understands me.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.537
His dad died
when he was young too.

04:57.715 --> 04:58.796
Yeah, yeah, back up.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.507
I'm still not quite past
the fact

05:00.676 --> 05:02.892
You're three years older.

05:03.012 --> 05:05.303
Dad was seven years older
than you.

05:05.389 --> 05:08.231
I was 30 and he was 37
when we met.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.202
That is a big difference
between a 21-year-old woman

05:12.271 --> 05:14.237
And an 18-year-old boy.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.406
Well, if the gender roles
were flipped,

05:16.483 --> 05:18.041
It wouldn't be a big deal.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.694
Besides, you always wanted me
to be more of a feminist.

05:20.863 --> 05:21.895
You should be thrilled.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.031
Not only am I president
of the sorority,

05:24.199 --> 05:25.306
But now I'm also dating--

05:25.409 --> 05:26.533
Yeah, wait, stop.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.493
You're the president now?

05:28.579 --> 05:30.720
Yeah, I told you this
months ago.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.756
Well, I thought you were
president of the keg committee,

05:33.792 --> 05:36.000
Not the whole house.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.412
You know, when I was in college,
I didn't have to pay friends

05:39.590 --> 05:40.763
To hang out with me.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.550
I should get back to the house.
Let's just do lunch another day.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.069
Oh, no, no. Okay, okay, okay.

05:46.221 --> 05:49.497
Let's just...Start the day
all over again.

05:49.767 --> 05:53.501
I didn't invite you to lunch
so we could have an argument.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.020
We usually do that
over breakfast.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.248
(laughing)

05:58.442 --> 06:00.858
Look, will you at least come
to my sorority house

06:00.944 --> 06:02.785
And see why it means
so much to me?

06:02.946 --> 06:05.696
And my little sister winter
really wants to meet you.

06:05.783 --> 06:08.441
She studies you
in her feminist studies class.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.443
How ironic.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.597
When I blew the whistle
on lancaster 15 years ago,

06:13.791 --> 06:16.750
Barely one other woman would
stand in solidarity with me.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.212
Now, I'm a pop quiz question.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.124
When roger lancaster
killed himself,

06:24.343 --> 06:26.551
People acted like I was
the one that shot him.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.145
I still get crazy letters
in the mail.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.813
You never told me that.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.101
Well, that's because you have
other things to worry about,

06:34.269 --> 06:36.302
Like the lsats.

06:36.480 --> 06:40.774
How'd your exam go?

06:40.984 --> 06:43.442
Hey, go greek, let's go.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.778
Where are the chi boys?

06:44.988 --> 06:46.053
Don't you mean, where's wally?

06:46.323 --> 06:48.632
He's probably getting plastered
with chase and the others.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.117
Uh, he better not be.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.986
I'm counting on him
to help us win.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.912
He's supposed to--

06:54.915 --> 06:56.790
Supposed to what?

06:56.950 --> 06:57.915
Do this?

06:57.917 --> 06:58.825
(laughing)

06:58.961 --> 06:59.659
-Hi!
-Hey!

06:59.837 --> 07:00.977
-I missed you.
-Missed you too.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.130
Can you two find like
a romance novel to pose for

07:03.382 --> 07:05.740
Before I literally barf
and ruin my new outfit?

07:05.843 --> 07:06.849
Oh, hey, don't worry.

07:06.969 --> 07:10.428
I'll hold your hair back
while you're puking.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.472
Wally, where are
your manners, buddy?

07:12.683 --> 07:15.492
Come on, get these ladies
some waters.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.478
You got it, boss.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.272
(football smacks, laughter)

07:21.275 --> 07:23.032
-Really?
-What?

07:23.193 --> 07:25.368
Oh, he's my pledge
to boss around for the year.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.003
Oh, look, besides,
come on, he loves it.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.429
Okay, well, for the record,

07:28.574 --> 07:31.024
I'll never make you
fetch my water.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.510
Um, are you kids just
gonna stand around here,

07:33.704 --> 07:36.120
Or are we gonna go out there
and win this thing?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.289
Come on, now!

07:37.541 --> 07:39.540
Let's go,
everybody say, "go greek!"

07:39.543 --> 07:40.775
Go greek!

07:40.878 --> 07:41.943
(cheering, clapping)

07:42.045 --> 07:43.369
All right. Go, team.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.112
-We'll see you out there.
-Go.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.539
(laughter)

07:46.717 --> 07:48.191
(indistinct chatter)

07:48.218 --> 07:49.617
Wow!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.711
Kaylee's boyfriend's
a lot cuter in person

07:51.847 --> 07:53.046
Than I thought he'd be.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.231
And very much off-limits,

07:55.350 --> 08:00.903
So maybe turn your eyes
to another prize.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.555
(shouting, cheering)

08:02.733 --> 08:04.324
Let's go, come on, pull!

08:04.359 --> 08:05.558
Pull!

08:05.569 --> 08:13.383
(indistinct shouting)

08:13.410 --> 08:15.485
(grunting)

08:15.579 --> 08:17.679
(cheering)

08:17.748 --> 08:20.256
(laughter)

08:20.258 --> 08:22.108
Oh my god.

08:22.211 --> 08:23.168
Come on.

08:23.328 --> 08:24.878
Oh my god.

08:25.088 --> 08:29.582
Um, I have something for you.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.052
Happy anniversary.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.164
Well, six-month anniversary,
anyway.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.359
We're lavaliering already?

08:39.436 --> 08:41.444
Is that what it's called?

08:41.605 --> 08:44.097
'cause...I just wanted
to let you know

08:44.107 --> 08:46.266
How special I think you are.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.843
I already do.

08:48.946 --> 08:49.903
No, wally!

08:50.072 --> 08:51.604
-What?
-I'm all sweaty!

08:51.782 --> 08:55.124
Who cares? So am I.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.126
Well, you're right.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.913
Greek life sure isn't
what I thought it was.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.164
Mom?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.957
What are you doing here?

09:03.085 --> 09:05.618
Well, you told me to come
visit you at your sorority.

09:05.879 --> 09:09.256
The girl at the house
said you'd be down here.

09:09.508 --> 09:14.444
Uh, well, I'd like for you
to meet my boyfriend.

09:14.513 --> 09:17.280
Hi, I'm wally lancaster.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.540
Um...Nice to meet you.

09:19.643 --> 09:23.286
I'm vera quaid.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.471
You're vera quaid?

09:25.649 --> 09:29.809
My mom is that vera quaid.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.902
Uh...

09:31.989 --> 09:35.615
Kaylee, why did you never
tell me who your mom was?

09:35.826 --> 09:37.317
I didn't think it mattered.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.968
Um, wait a minute.

09:39.162 --> 09:44.808
Wally, did you say
your last name was lancaster?

09:45.002 --> 09:49.420
Well, you're not related
to that roger lancaster, right?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.164
I mean, just because
you have the same--

09:51.341 --> 09:53.407
He's my dad.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.575
(he sighs)

09:54.678 --> 09:58.020
Or he was, um...

09:58.140 --> 10:00.748
He killed himself
when I was three.

10:00.934 --> 10:05.528
But...You both probably
already know that.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.180
I'm sorry, kaylee,
I have to go.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.589
-Wally...
-I'm sorry.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.333
Wally, don't go.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.518
(footsteps departing)

10:12.654 --> 10:13.803
(kaylee sighs)

10:13.905 --> 10:20.193
(crickets chirping)

10:20.370 --> 10:32.338
(phone keys tapping)

10:32.341 --> 10:35.041
(phone clicks)

10:35.218 --> 10:36.843
(lights click off)

10:37.054 --> 10:38.845
Hey, I'm still studying!

10:39.014 --> 10:42.048
Don't lock me in.

10:42.184 --> 10:45.902
(lights click on)

10:45.979 --> 10:48.721
(lights click off)

10:48.723 --> 10:50.064
(door creaking)

10:50.067 --> 10:55.236
(footsteps echoing)

10:55.405 --> 10:57.138
Is anybody here?

10:57.240 --> 11:01.751
(door closes)

11:01.787 --> 11:05.813
Who's there?

11:05.916 --> 11:15.006
(panting)

11:15.175 --> 11:23.589
(panting)

11:23.833 --> 11:25.591
(door knob rattling)

11:25.727 --> 11:26.926
Anyone?!

11:27.062 --> 11:28.061
Open the door!

11:28.230 --> 11:30.204
(smacking door)

11:30.206 --> 11:31.231
Kaylee?

11:31.441 --> 11:32.615
Why are you screaming?
What's happening?

11:32.734 --> 11:34.234
Somebody locked me
in the building.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.935
They were breaking stuff and--

11:36.071 --> 11:37.178
(janitor grunts)

11:37.280 --> 11:39.939
(panting)

11:40.200 --> 11:43.701
You know raleigh hall
closes at 8:00, right?

11:43.704 --> 11:45.536
Sorry, I just...

11:45.622 --> 11:46.946
I haven't been acting
like myself

11:47.124 --> 11:49.131
Since wally and I broke up...

11:49.209 --> 11:52.042
Or I think we broke up.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.938
He hasn't been answering
my calls or texts.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.806
The guy sure is a real mess.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.642
I mean, it's starting
to piss me off, actually.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.929
Wally hasn't--he's been
a real downer lately.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.723
Has he said anything about me?

12:04.975 --> 12:08.651
No, he barely talks to anybody.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.561
And he still
hasn't asked anybody

12:10.605 --> 12:13.606
To our toga formal
on Saturday.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.310
You think winter
would go out with him?

12:17.487 --> 12:20.547
You want him to ask out winter?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.406
I mean, they're both pledges.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.468
Sounds like
a perfect match to me.

12:25.537 --> 12:29.413
And I'm not because I'm older?

12:29.499 --> 12:31.891
You're the president
of your sorority.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.295
Wouldn't be appropriate
for you to date a new pledge.

12:35.464 --> 12:37.630
And who is appropriate?

12:37.791 --> 12:41.684
You?

12:41.720 --> 12:43.503
Why not?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.306
Be my date to the formal.

12:46.600 --> 12:53.437
You know, you can't come unless
a chi officially invites you.

12:53.482 --> 12:57.000
Fine, but only as friends.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.760
And it'll give me a chance
to talk to wally.

12:59.863 --> 13:09.345
(birds chirping)

13:09.372 --> 13:10.288
(laughter)

13:10.540 --> 13:12.098
I'll do it with you, it's okay.

13:12.209 --> 13:14.367
You guys are embarrassing me.

13:14.503 --> 13:15.685
(chase gasps)

13:15.754 --> 13:17.036
You actually showed up.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.671
Here you go, birthday boy.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.723
You better drink every drop.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.675
What is it?

13:22.886 --> 13:24.360
What's up with the bourbon?

13:24.513 --> 13:26.379
A million years ago,
someone came up with the idea

13:26.640 --> 13:28.531
That the thetas have to give
the chi president

13:28.683 --> 13:30.624
A bottle of bourbon
on his 21st birthday.

13:30.727 --> 13:31.684
And vice versa,

13:31.978 --> 13:35.813
'cause last year I had to give
kaylee a bottle, and I...

13:35.816 --> 13:36.964
Wait...

13:37.067 --> 13:38.899
Are you re-gifting me?

13:38.902 --> 13:39.943
(laughter)

13:40.111 --> 13:42.028
Get in here, you cheapskates.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.413
Hey, chase, I just finished
setting up the dj equipment

13:44.491 --> 13:46.807
By the hot tub, but, um...

13:46.910 --> 13:48.901
Oh, uh...

13:49.079 --> 13:53.206
Hi, kaylee.

13:53.458 --> 13:57.193
Wally, why don't you get
in the hot tub with winter

13:57.254 --> 14:00.880
And do something you'll both
regret in the morning?

14:01.174 --> 14:03.824
Listen, chase, I don't know if I
really wanna do that right now.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.718
You want what I want.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.237
Don't cop an attitude.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.224
You gotta do whatever I say
until your sophomore year.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.334
-Okay?
-Okay.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.562
Now go!

14:15.772 --> 14:19.916
Chase, can I talk to you? Alone?

14:20.110 --> 14:29.609
Wally, why don't you show
both of us the hot tub?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.368
So...

14:31.454 --> 14:33.262
How alone with me
do you want to get?

14:33.331 --> 14:34.855
Stop the douche boy act.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.633
Why are you trying to get
in the way of me and wally?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.544
Actually, you're the one
in wally's way.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.755
I want the kid
to sow his oats.

14:42.966 --> 14:46.125
So, why don't you have a drink

14:46.303 --> 14:49.429
And get off my back?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.631
You know, you used to be fun.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.874
(birds chirping)

14:53.977 --> 15:03.776
(chatter)

15:03.987 --> 15:05.278
People are having a good time.

15:05.488 --> 15:06.629
What a great turnout.

15:06.698 --> 15:07.880
Yeah, I like it here.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.740
Yeah, your hair looks great.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.634
Oh, thanks.
Is it a mess right now?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.652
...Get something out.

15:12.895 --> 15:14.587
No, it looks great.

15:14.589 --> 15:15.788
Okay.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.955
I was working on it.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.666
Yeah, I get it, I'm the new guy.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.878
It's okay, I am too.

15:22.038 --> 15:23.262
Oh, thanks.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.488
Cleaning your hair.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.932
Act like you're not
much of a dancer!

15:27.010 --> 15:29.426
What gives it away? Thanks.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.346
Actually, it was just
an excuse to touch you.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.589
(chatter)

15:33.808 --> 15:36.676
It didn't winter long
to move in on him.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.770
I told you not to pick her
to be your little sister.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.364
Yeah, I know, but...
I don't know,

15:42.525 --> 15:45.485
I felt bad when I found out
no one wanted to be her big.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.670
Besides, go easy on her.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.763
She's young.

15:49.866 --> 15:51.857
So is he.

15:51.993 --> 15:56.512
Maybe too young.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.605
Uh, well, I'm gonna head off.

15:58.708 --> 16:01.442
See you at home. Bye.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.544
Be right back, okay?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.204
(chatter)

16:05.340 --> 16:06.631
Wait.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.875
Hey, listen,
I don't want you to go, okay?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.377
Winter's cute.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.029
I don't blame you.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.097
You can give her this.

16:14.257 --> 16:15.564
No, listen.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.475
I'm sorry
I didn't call you back.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.236
Okay, I just...

16:20.397 --> 16:22.371
I've been trying
to figure all this out.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.630
It's okay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.132
I understand.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.726
You don't want to be
together anymore.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.561
No, that's not it at all, I...

16:28.738 --> 16:32.322
Well, then,
what did you figure out?

16:32.325 --> 16:34.491
That I love you.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.252
Kaylee, all my life,
my mom told me

16:36.413 --> 16:40.540
About how vera quaid destroyed
our family's reputation,

16:40.750 --> 16:43.392
And I was too ashamed
to talk about it.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.669
That's why I never told you
what happened.

16:45.755 --> 16:47.596
Well, what happened
between our parents

16:47.674 --> 16:49.081
Has nothing to do with us.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.550
My mom was furious

16:50.760 --> 16:52.593
When she found out I met you.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.588
And last night over the phone,
she told me

16:55.807 --> 16:59.242
I had to decide
who I wanted more in my life,

16:59.269 --> 17:00.834
You or her.

17:00.979 --> 17:04.664
I won't come
between you and your mom.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.767
Because I chose you, kaylee.

17:07.944 --> 17:12.104
That is, if you still want me.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.514
Yeah.

17:13.616 --> 17:19.512
(chatter)

17:19.581 --> 17:25.692
(both laughing)

17:25.795 --> 17:30.423
Oh, what's the rush?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.925
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

17:33.136 --> 17:34.761
That's what I'm talkin' about!

17:34.971 --> 17:36.428
I knew you two would make up.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.597
Give me some.

17:37.807 --> 17:38.931
The guys are gathering
downstairs

17:39.142 --> 17:40.149
For my birthday shots,
you ready?

17:40.310 --> 17:43.803
Time to go, let's do this thing,
man, come on.

17:44.046 --> 17:46.213
Oh, sorry, kaylee.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.140
Guys only.

17:48.276 --> 17:52.903
Wally's only 18.

17:52.906 --> 17:59.059
So, he's a minor.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.577
Birthday shots?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.229
Don't get crazy
with him in there.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.656
You know what happened
to the omegas

18:03.917 --> 18:05.324
When they were busted
for underage drinking.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.793
Don't worry.

18:07.045 --> 18:13.907
I'll have your boy toy back
before you know it.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.301
(sighs)

18:15.512 --> 18:18.579
So, uh, how did things go
with ryan 2.0?

18:18.681 --> 18:20.430
His name wasn't ryan.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.174
(laughing)

18:22.352 --> 18:23.993
This party's dying.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.145
Everybody's going to pike's.
Should we go?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.922
Uh...No,
I'm gonna wait for wally.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.758
He's been inside with chase and
the other guys for a while now.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.687
They're doing some sort
of secret initiation thing.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.021
Initiation?

18:36.199 --> 18:37.447
Pledge week is over.

18:37.534 --> 18:38.991
Yeah, these guys look
for any excuse

18:39.202 --> 18:40.450
To get naked with a goat

18:40.537 --> 18:43.195
Or whatever they do
in the basement.

18:43.373 --> 18:44.713
Ew. Really?

18:44.874 --> 18:46.790
-You're crazy!
-Oh, you did good, man.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.668
-I did? You swear?
-I'm proud of you.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.202
It's the best party ever, bro!

18:50.380 --> 18:51.445
The best party ever!

18:51.548 --> 18:53.172
(cheering)

18:53.383 --> 18:54.631
Where'd everybody go?

18:54.676 --> 18:57.526
-Hey.
-Hey, handsome.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.120
I'm so happy
we're back together.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.897
How much did you have to drink?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.066
Why, you want some?
Here, catch. Oh...

19:04.102 --> 19:05.326
(splashing, laughing)

19:05.395 --> 19:06.644
Man overboard!

19:06.896 --> 19:08.937
I told you to take care of him.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.706
I'm not his dad, so,

19:10.775 --> 19:12.966
Why are you acting like his mom?

19:13.111 --> 19:15.469
Uh, he's blitzed
out of his mind.

19:15.572 --> 19:16.362
I'm fine.

19:16.531 --> 19:17.530
Come on, wally.

19:17.740 --> 19:18.865
Let's get up, come on.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.217
Okay.

19:21.411 --> 19:24.845
You know, the only person
not having any fun around here

19:24.914 --> 19:26.313
Is you.

19:26.499 --> 19:30.743
So the only person
that should leave is you.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.378
Chase, stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:32.547 --> 19:33.837
Come on, wally.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.581
I'm sick of you
bossing him around!

19:35.675 --> 19:36.357
Hey!

19:36.467 --> 19:38.859
Chase, chase, let her go, stop!

19:38.861 --> 19:41.036
(crashing, splashing)

19:41.038 --> 19:42.688
Wally!

19:42.765 --> 19:43.906
(electricity zapping)

19:43.975 --> 19:45.758
Don't touch the water!

19:45.894 --> 19:47.059
Wally!

19:47.303 --> 19:49.086
You'll get electrocuted too.

19:49.189 --> 19:59.104
(kaylee gasping)

20:05.455 --> 20:07.954
(birds chirping)

20:07.957 --> 20:11.751
Kaylee.

20:11.994 --> 20:15.554
The service starts soon.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.607
I never told him I loved him.

20:18.801 --> 20:22.595
He told me he loved me,
but I never said it back.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.888
Why didn't I say it back?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.891
Wally knew
how you felt about him.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.786
No, he didn't.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.622
And now he never will.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.734
This has to be a bad dream.

20:37.820 --> 20:42.131
Gosh darn, that's a nasty gate.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.166
Y'all need to get
that mess fixed.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.243
I don't mind cookin'
and cleanin' for y'all,

20:46.329 --> 20:48.162
But outdoor repairs
are not my thing.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.826
Uh, this is
the theta house, right?

20:54.045 --> 20:55.995
I'm carolyn,
your new house mom.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.646
You are?

20:57.757 --> 21:00.090
But you're, like, so young.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.683
Well, thank you.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.261
You're just not what
we were expecting.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.988
Our last house mom was 80.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.248
Well, honestly,
you're not what I expected

21:08.434 --> 21:10.159
Sorority gals
to look like either.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.085
Is the goth look back in?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.513
'cause y'all look like
you're dressed for a funeral.

21:14.691 --> 21:18.167
Yeah, we...We are.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.186
Oh my word, I'm so sorry, I...

21:21.447 --> 21:25.341
I just--I wanna drop dead
right now from bad manners.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.692
And that sounds even worse.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.360
No, it's--it's okay.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.329
You didn't know.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.622
Welcome to the theta house.

21:32.709 --> 21:35.351
We're happy to have
a new house mom.

21:35.420 --> 21:44.268
Well, this'll be fun!

21:44.270 --> 21:46.953
Mom? You came?

21:47.056 --> 21:48.722
(people sobbing)

21:48.725 --> 21:50.516
You barely knew wally.

21:50.685 --> 21:51.992
You met him once.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.186
I know how much
he meant to you,

21:54.397 --> 22:04.313
So he means a lot to me.

22:04.449 --> 22:13.980
So he means a lot to me.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.575
Why was I such a jerk to wally?

22:16.711 --> 22:18.760
(birds chirping)

22:18.880 --> 22:22.339
I hope he knows
I never meant it,

22:22.425 --> 22:25.601
'cause he was like
a real little brother to me.

22:25.762 --> 22:29.755
Why did I let him put the
speakers so close to the water?

22:29.932 --> 22:32.433
It's not anybody's fault.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.429
Then whose fault is it?

22:37.607 --> 22:39.565
You're wally's mom?

22:39.776 --> 22:42.068
I hoped we would meet one day,

22:42.278 --> 22:44.436
Under better circumstances.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.238
But this is par for the course

22:46.449 --> 22:49.124
When it comes
to your family and mine.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.778
First, your mother
got rid of my husband,

22:52.955 --> 22:55.797
And now you got rid of my son.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.917
Don't take your anger out
on my daughter.

22:58.127 --> 23:01.770
Why don't you stay out of--

23:01.798 --> 23:04.973
Vera?

23:05.093 --> 23:10.370
I didn't recognize you
with the new hair.

23:10.556 --> 23:20.456
My sympathies go out
for you and your family.

23:20.608 --> 23:28.321
My sympathies go out
for you and your family.

23:28.324 --> 23:30.165
(slaps, all gasping)

23:30.201 --> 23:32.075
(breathing heavily)

23:32.078 --> 23:35.187
(chatter)

23:35.331 --> 23:37.089
It's okay, everyone.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.624
I'm sure she'll sue me,

23:38.835 --> 23:40.809
Just like she sued my husband.

23:40.878 --> 23:43.495
In fact, why don't I...

23:43.714 --> 23:45.739
Why don't I save ms. Quaid
the trouble

23:45.967 --> 23:49.242
And write her a check right now
for all the pain and anguish

23:49.387 --> 23:51.320
My slap surely put her through.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.597
Sabrina, please don't do this.

23:53.683 --> 23:56.082
Oh, would you rather have cash?

23:56.185 --> 23:57.810
(rustling)

23:58.020 --> 23:59.695
Take it, take it all!

23:59.856 --> 24:02.665
You might as well,
because I have nothing left!

24:02.817 --> 24:05.818
What your husband did to me
was settled years ago.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.777
-It's over!
-If it was,

24:07.864 --> 24:09.838
Then your daughter
wouldn't have targeted my son

24:09.949 --> 24:11.857
As soon as he enrolled
on campus.

24:12.034 --> 24:14.543
I want you out of here!

24:14.620 --> 24:15.661
Mrs. Lancaster, please...

24:15.872 --> 24:17.454
This is a day for wally,

24:17.540 --> 24:19.698
And I refuse to have
you lecherous women

24:19.834 --> 24:22.792
Be a part of it.

24:22.794 --> 24:26.038
Now leave.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.340
Get out!

24:28.509 --> 24:30.192
Come on, honey.

24:30.219 --> 24:34.371
It's okay.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.680
(snipping)

24:35.725 --> 24:43.647
(crickets chirping)

24:43.649 --> 24:47.467
(branch snaps)

24:47.570 --> 24:51.522
(sighs)

24:51.524 --> 24:54.975
(snipping)

24:55.077 --> 24:56.719
(rustling)

24:56.787 --> 24:58.570
What story are you gonna tell?

24:58.706 --> 24:59.905
Chase!

25:00.041 --> 25:03.584
You scared me.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.894
Why are you gardening at night?

25:06.088 --> 25:09.431
I wanted to pick a bouquet
of roses for wally's grave.

25:09.592 --> 25:11.416
Since I was kicked out
of his service today,

25:11.594 --> 25:14.102
I thought I'd go back tomorrow.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.997
That's nice.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.558
But you still haven't answered
my question.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.894
What story are you gonna tell?

25:22.054 --> 25:23.503
Story?

25:23.606 --> 25:26.248
About how wally died.

25:26.442 --> 25:29.235
You sound like you want me
to make something up.

25:29.403 --> 25:32.321
Do you plan to?

25:32.490 --> 25:34.514
Chase, you're shaking.

25:34.617 --> 25:38.944
Are you okay?

25:39.205 --> 25:43.398
A detective came by
asking questions about wally.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.934
Yeah, he's from some
insurance company.

25:46.128 --> 25:48.470
Apparently his mom had
a life insurance policy on him.

25:48.631 --> 25:51.123
What, his mom took out
a life insurance policy

25:51.300 --> 25:53.442
On her 18-year-old son?

25:53.636 --> 26:01.633
That's weird. My mom
doesn't have a policy on me.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.476
Did...

26:03.479 --> 26:06.605
You and wally ever do...

26:06.765 --> 26:09.658
Ghb?

26:09.735 --> 26:12.294
Ghb? No, of course not.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.280
That's like a date-rape drug.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.115
Why would you even think that?

26:16.367 --> 26:21.470
Because it was in wally's system
the night he died.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.897
His mom told me today.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.825
I guess she ordered
an autopsy on him or something.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.918
An autopsy?

26:29.005 --> 26:31.814
But it's so obvious
how wally died.

26:31.841 --> 26:35.000
(rustling)

26:35.094 --> 26:37.218
Hey!

26:37.221 --> 26:38.687
Who's there?

26:38.764 --> 26:50.757
Chase, wait, calm down.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.851
I was just taking out
the garbage.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.186
I'm on trash detail.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.862
Then why were you eavesdropping?

26:55.865 --> 26:57.940
Chase, stop it.

26:57.942 --> 26:58.857
Sorry.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.283
You gave us a scare.

27:00.328 --> 27:02.694
Yeah, you gave me one too.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.663
(crickets chirping)

27:05.708 --> 27:08.250
Why are you acting like this?

27:10.212 --> 27:12.537
Because if that detective
keeps coming by,

27:12.673 --> 27:14.857
Asking questions,

27:15.051 --> 27:18.010
Then everything I've ever worked
for could blow up in my face.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.678
You didn't do anything wrong.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.288
But it looks like I did.

27:22.433 --> 27:25.517
My fraternity brother died,
kaylee.

27:25.728 --> 27:27.686
Right in front of us.

27:27.897 --> 27:32.191
It was just a terrible accident.

27:32.401 --> 27:35.243
I keep telling myself that,

27:35.363 --> 27:39.281
But the more I do,
the less I believe it.

27:43.579 --> 27:48.207
You make it sound like wally
was killed on purpose.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.251
Was he?

27:59.679 --> 28:01.011
(kaylee gasps)

28:02.556 --> 28:04.256
Everything okay?

28:04.499 --> 28:06.441
Yeah, um...

28:06.602 --> 28:09.094
I think I'm just gonna go
take a shower.

28:09.230 --> 28:11.112
It's been a day.

28:11.148 --> 28:13.189
Good night.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.508
Kaylee!

28:15.611 --> 28:17.695
Don't forget these.

28:22.960 --> 28:33.010
Thanks.

28:33.012 --> 28:42.794
(shower running)

28:42.930 --> 29:03.632
(shower running)

29:03.701 --> 29:13.625
(curtain rattles closed)

29:13.836 --> 29:40.352
(curtain rattles closed)

29:40.488 --> 29:50.436
(water running)

29:50.539 --> 30:05.969
(water running)

30:25.491 --> 30:26.715
Okay, everybody.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.550
Out with it.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.552
Who wrote that sick message
on the bathroom mirror

30:30.579 --> 30:34.330
Last night?

30:34.416 --> 30:36.174
What makes theta different
from the other houses

30:36.210 --> 30:37.901
Is our honesty

30:38.045 --> 30:41.930
And how we all
stand together.

30:42.049 --> 30:45.100
Unless...You're all standing
together in the belief

30:45.219 --> 30:46.993
That what happened to wally
is my fault.

30:47.096 --> 30:50.238
Kaylee, of course not!

30:50.266 --> 30:51.606
Fine.

30:51.767 --> 30:52.891
Then, one by one,
I want you to tell me

30:53.102 --> 30:54.851
If you wrote the message

30:54.854 --> 30:56.728
Or know who did.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.347
Jessica?

30:59.441 --> 31:03.718
Sam?

31:03.779 --> 31:04.886
Winter?

31:05.072 --> 31:07.113
I'd never do
something like that.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.207
I know it wasn't lori.

31:09.285 --> 31:10.592
Why couldn't it be lori?

31:10.661 --> 31:12.560
Uh, because I'm her best friend.

31:12.663 --> 31:13.561
And I'm her little,

31:13.789 --> 31:15.581
But that didn't stop her
from accusing me.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.583
Maybe because you haven't
stopped glaring at her.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.751
I'm sorry I'm not doing
jumping jacks.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.103
Wally was my friend too.

31:21.297 --> 31:23.638
You knew him for literally,
like, less than two minutes.

31:23.799 --> 31:25.591
And I could have gotten
to know him much better,

31:25.801 --> 31:26.866
But now I never will.

31:27.136 --> 31:29.461
We all know you wanted to be
more than just friends with him.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.946
Okay, fine.

31:31.015 --> 31:32.480
Winter, you're right.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.066
I shouldn't assume
anyone here is innocent.

31:35.102 --> 31:39.754
Lori, did you write it?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.857
And it really hurts that you
would even think that I could.

31:42.151 --> 31:44.817
Kaylee, why are you only asking
us and not the other sisters?

31:44.987 --> 31:46.494
'cause we were the only ones
in the house when it happened.

31:46.655 --> 31:48.663
That doesn't mean
someone else couldn't get in.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.015
It's not like we have
a guard dog at the door.

31:51.160 --> 31:52.567
(cell phone rings)

31:52.786 --> 31:53.952
(kaylee, exclaiming)
hang on, lemme get this.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.403
No, I think we're done here.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.422
It's pretty obvious
where your loyalties lie,

31:57.499 --> 31:59.658
And they're not with us.

31:59.901 --> 32:02.127
(phone continues to ring)

32:02.296 --> 32:03.587
Lori, wait, don't be mad.

32:03.839 --> 32:06.739
I had to ask everyone,
to be fair.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.049
(exclaims)

32:08.177 --> 32:11.345
Hey, chase, it's really
not a good time.

32:11.555 --> 32:14.430
We're packing up wally's stuff.

32:14.516 --> 32:15.674
I thought maybe
you'd like to come

32:15.851 --> 32:17.659
And take a memento of wally's

32:17.811 --> 32:22.530
Before his mom comes
and takes it all away.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.274
Man, I didn't think
it was gonna be this hard.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.426
It's like wally's
dying in front of me

32:26.528 --> 32:28.703
All over again.

32:28.739 --> 32:30.680
I'll be right there.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.708
Thanks, kaylee.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.309
(sighs)

32:35.537 --> 32:38.454
I don't know if I can
get through any of this.

32:38.499 --> 32:41.958
Each day's harder
than the next.

32:42.044 --> 32:44.293
It's just nice to know
I can reach out to you.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.837
I feel the same.

32:46.090 --> 32:47.798
Things at the house here
haven't exactly felt

32:47.967 --> 32:50.208
Warm and cheery.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.827
I'll see you soon.

32:53.055 --> 32:56.047
I'm not letting you leave
until you have five bites.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.683
At least five.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.702
It looks delicious, but
I'm not very hungry right now.

33:00.854 --> 33:04.022
Well, you weren't hungry
yesterday or the day before.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.358
I know what's going on here.

33:06.527 --> 33:08.727
I'm not anorexic.

33:08.904 --> 33:11.154
But you're in grief,

33:11.240 --> 33:16.401
And that is just as hard
on the body.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.361
Okay. I'll take a leg to go.

33:18.455 --> 33:22.891
Kaylee, about that message
written on the bathroom mirror.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.484
Maybe it wasn't meant for you.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.411
But I was in the shower.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.337
But the girl who wrote it,

33:28.424 --> 33:31.507
Did she know
it was you in the shower?

33:31.552 --> 33:40.266
Just something
to think about.

33:40.269 --> 33:44.270
Good girl.

33:44.273 --> 33:54.389
(sighs)

33:54.391 --> 34:24.469
(sighs)

34:24.605 --> 34:36.481
(faint jangling)

34:36.658 --> 34:38.724
His phone is toast.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.319
You sure?

34:41.538 --> 34:44.790
He always took
so many pictures of us.

34:45.033 --> 34:48.317
He never sent me
the last one he took.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.570
There must be some way
to recover it.

34:50.672 --> 34:52.180
I already tried.

34:52.216 --> 34:54.065
It's broken.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.425
Maybe the case protected it,

34:56.512 --> 34:58.336
Or maybe he backed it up
to the cloud?

34:58.514 --> 35:00.188
I already checked.

35:00.307 --> 35:03.691
Wally was lousy
about backing stuff up.

35:03.852 --> 35:08.847
So, all his last photos
and videos are gone.

35:08.982 --> 35:12.734
(faint birdsong)

35:17.950 --> 35:19.115
(chase sighs)

35:19.118 --> 35:22.844
(kaylee inhales)

35:22.913 --> 35:25.713
Still smells like him.

35:25.833 --> 35:28.941
His terrible, cheap
dollar-store cologne

35:29.128 --> 35:32.220
That somehow still made him
smell so good.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.856
It's like he just
went out to get a burger,

35:35.050 --> 35:39.210
And if we wait long enough,
he'll be right back.

35:39.388 --> 35:44.182
But he's not coming back.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.459
You should keep that jacket.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.387
No. I couldn't.

35:49.523 --> 35:51.389
Why not?

35:51.400 --> 35:52.991
His mom'll just
bury it in a closet

35:53.026 --> 35:57.696
Or donate it.

35:57.906 --> 36:03.034
Wally would want you to have it.

36:03.245 --> 36:06.421
I asked him out first, you know?

36:06.498 --> 36:08.089
He kept saying no,

36:08.208 --> 36:12.001
But lori dared me
to keep trying.

36:12.045 --> 36:15.246
He always laughed
at my bad jokes.

36:15.424 --> 36:18.766
He was so easy to talk to.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.252
It was like
he had been waiting for me

36:21.430 --> 36:24.739
His entire life
to find him,

36:24.766 --> 36:28.000
But now he's gone.

36:28.103 --> 36:33.264
I miss him so much.

36:33.442 --> 36:46.928
(sniffling)

36:46.997 --> 36:50.706
Have you two no shame?

36:50.751 --> 36:53.084
Right here
in his own bedroom?

36:53.295 --> 36:54.786
It's not what it looks like.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.621
I just came by to--

36:56.798 --> 36:59.048
To steal my son's things?

36:59.051 --> 37:00.592
Give me that!

37:00.761 --> 37:02.218
Wally was my boyfriend.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.369
For how long?

37:03.472 --> 37:04.537
A few months?

37:04.806 --> 37:08.040
I was married to my husband
for ten years before he died,

37:08.185 --> 37:10.618
But no one ran
to comfort me.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.561
They just jeered,

37:12.648 --> 37:17.216
Said it was justice
that he died.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.811
So if you've come to me
for sympathy...

37:19.988 --> 37:21.446
(sarcastic chuckle)

37:21.657 --> 37:23.239
...I'm afraid I'm clean out.

37:23.325 --> 37:26.225
Kaylee, come on,
let's get out of here.

37:26.453 --> 37:29.679
I'm tired of walking on
eggshells around this woman.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.807
What you say really hurts,
you know that?

37:32.876 --> 37:36.311
Good. I hope it hurts...

37:36.380 --> 37:38.738
Just as much as you hurt him.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.239
I never hurt him!

37:40.425 --> 37:42.968
Well, somebody put that ghb
in his system.

37:43.136 --> 37:45.503
My boy never did drugs.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.930
And the alcohol?

37:47.975 --> 37:50.191
What 18-year-old
drinks bourbon?

37:50.352 --> 37:52.527
Wally never should have
been drinking.

37:52.688 --> 37:56.605
I told chase that
when I gave him the bottle.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.775
The bourbon
my son got so drunk on

37:59.778 --> 38:01.152
Came from you?

38:01.321 --> 38:02.928
It's--it's a tradition.

38:03.073 --> 38:06.615
I--we were taking shots,
and, uh,

38:06.702 --> 38:09.043
Wally must have snuck some
when I wasn't looking.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.663
To impress the older woman
in his life?

38:11.873 --> 38:13.331
I'm not that much older.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.034
But you are
in a position of power.

38:16.295 --> 38:20.955
You, the confident, overbearing
sorority president,

38:21.174 --> 38:23.632
With her eyes on
an impressionable young man

38:23.719 --> 38:25.510
Here on a baseball scholarship.

38:25.721 --> 38:28.304
Did my son really
want to date you?

38:28.348 --> 38:30.198
Or was he afraid
what would happen

38:30.309 --> 38:32.458
If he refused your advances?

38:32.602 --> 38:34.869
No. You have it all wrong.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.038
Do I?

38:37.232 --> 38:43.361
Because you may have
to prove I'm wrong one day.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.248
Now, if you'll excuse me,

38:47.409 --> 38:52.887
I want to pack up
my dead son's things.

38:52.914 --> 39:03.005
By myself.

39:03.007 --> 39:07.827
By myself.

39:08.071 --> 39:10.279
I think it's time for a lawyer.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.140
Could I be charged
with something?

39:12.434 --> 39:15.835
Well, if you supplied the
alcohol wally got drink with,

39:15.937 --> 39:17.612
Possibly.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.522
Well, sabrina isn't
the only one who thinks

39:19.566 --> 39:21.449
I had a part in his death.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.068
One of the girls in the house
wrote a message

39:23.278 --> 39:24.844
On my bathroom mirror.

39:25.030 --> 39:30.742
It said, "we know
you killed wally."

39:30.952 --> 39:33.018
Oh, that's just a sick joke.

39:33.121 --> 39:34.779
Who makes a joke like that?

39:35.040 --> 39:37.615
People who can't properly handle
their own grief.

39:37.793 --> 39:40.868
Especially jealous girlfriends.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.287
Wally didn't have
any other girlfriends.

39:43.548 --> 39:46.699
What about the girls
that he dated before you?

39:46.802 --> 39:48.551
You mean in high school?

39:48.637 --> 39:50.612
I mean, yeah,
he dated other girls,

39:50.764 --> 39:53.814
But I was his only girlfriend
in college.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.101
A loyal fraternity boy.

39:56.269 --> 40:03.491
Isn't that an oxymoron?

40:03.568 --> 40:04.984
He wasn't like other guys.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.386
No? Perhaps he was
worse than you thought.

40:07.489 --> 40:08.947
The ghb in a drink?

40:09.157 --> 40:11.132
I mean, wake up, kaylee.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.350
Maybe he wasn't the knight
in shining baseball ar--

40:13.495 --> 40:15.637
(car screams past)

40:15.705 --> 40:17.121
Quick! Get the license plate!

40:17.165 --> 40:18.331
Is that guy crazy?

40:18.616 --> 40:20.825
He could have
accidentally hit us.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.752
Was it an accident?

40:23.755 --> 40:25.480
I don't get it.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.340
Why would someone
try to hurt me?

40:45.152 --> 40:55.100
(doorbell rings)

40:55.203 --> 41:13.786
(doorbell rings)

41:13.972 --> 41:16.547
Oh, uh, kaylee,
you got a package.

41:16.725 --> 41:22.053
Oh. I wasn't expecting anything.

41:22.230 --> 41:23.904
Let's open 'er up.

41:24.024 --> 41:30.578
I really wanna do this
right now.

41:30.580 --> 41:31.729
(gasps)

41:31.907 --> 41:33.806
What? What's wrong?

41:33.992 --> 41:36.718
I know I shouldn't have
opened it.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.587
I forgot I ordered these
costumes for me and wally.

41:39.706 --> 41:41.146
We were gonna go
as an '80s hair metal band

41:41.374 --> 41:42.998
For the masquerade formal
we're supposed to have here

41:43.000 --> 41:44.342
Next week.

41:44.419 --> 41:45.818
What do you mean "supposed to"?

41:45.921 --> 41:47.378
You wanna cancel the formal?

41:47.422 --> 41:49.147
We host the masquerade
every year.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.465
Well, how can we throw a party

41:50.759 --> 41:53.651
When we've been
at each others' throats lately?

41:53.762 --> 41:56.495
Uh, we haven't been that bad.

41:56.598 --> 41:57.605
Really?

41:57.766 --> 41:59.164
You two have been
giving me the cold shoulder

41:59.267 --> 42:02.393
For weeks now.

42:02.604 --> 42:03.761
I'm sorry about that.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.112
Okay, we shouldn't
have gotten so upset

42:05.273 --> 42:07.506
When you questioned us about
that message on your mirror.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.917
Yeah. And we don't know who
the witches are who did that,

42:10.070 --> 42:12.528
But once we find out,
we're gonna kick their butt.

42:12.531 --> 42:13.537
Right on!

42:13.698 --> 42:15.923
Now, that's the kind
of sisterhood I can get into.

42:16.117 --> 42:19.518
No. The last thing this house
needs is more conflict.

42:19.788 --> 42:23.122
Which is exactly why we need to
go forward with the masquerade.

42:23.375 --> 42:26.233
Wally wouldn't want us
just moping around.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.919
He did like a good party.

42:28.129 --> 42:29.862
We can hold it in his honor.

42:29.965 --> 42:32.807
So...The formal is still on?

42:32.968 --> 42:36.368
Yes. But no drinking
and no drugs of any kind.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.721
The pan-hellenic council is
cracking down on all the houses

42:38.807 --> 42:41.449
After what happened
at the chi house.

42:41.560 --> 42:44.285
A sorority formal
with no drinking?

42:44.312 --> 42:45.636
(inaudible)

42:45.814 --> 42:47.288
Lori, I'm serious.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.440
Yeah, especially if we want
to do this in his honor.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.717
Lori, you'll cooperate?

42:51.861 --> 42:54.161
Yeah, yeah, I'll try to behave.

42:54.281 --> 42:56.071
Do house moms get
to come to these things

42:56.157 --> 42:58.283
Or do I have to stay
locked up in my room?

42:58.451 --> 43:00.501
Of course you can come.

43:00.662 --> 43:04.146
Oh! I used to wear that stuff
for real.

43:04.332 --> 43:06.391
Now my old clothes
are your costume.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.083
Oh. Poor carolyn.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.660
No, poor you.

43:09.879 --> 43:12.647
Poor you, girl.
You just wait and wait

43:12.841 --> 43:15.333
Until all the ladies are wearing
what you're wearing right now

43:15.468 --> 43:16.984
For Halloween.

43:17.012 --> 43:27.102
(laughter)

43:27.104 --> 43:39.190
(laughter)

43:39.367 --> 43:41.542
Maybe drinking is overrated.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.861
Everyone's having way more fun
than I thought they would.

43:43.997 --> 43:44.787
Yeah, so am I.

43:44.873 --> 43:47.272
I'm glad
you talked me into this.

43:47.459 --> 43:48.866
I know it's too soon
for you to date again,

43:49.085 --> 43:51.519
But I'm glad that you're
not hiding yourself away.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.612
Yeah. Well, it's definitely
too soon for me to date,

43:53.757 --> 43:56.190
But it does feel good
to be social.

43:56.301 --> 43:59.010
Avoidance is not the answer.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.303
So, who do you think it was?

44:01.348 --> 44:03.197
The message on the mirror?

44:03.266 --> 44:05.700
Surely you must suspect someone.

44:05.894 --> 44:09.570
No. I mean, I love everyone
at the theta house.

44:09.731 --> 44:11.356
I can't imagine who would do
something so mean.

44:11.566 --> 44:13.465
You guys are all like
my real sisters.

44:13.693 --> 44:16.903
But even real sisters stab each
other in the back sometimes.

44:46.768 --> 44:50.895
Uh, why are you wearing
the costume I bought for wally?

44:51.106 --> 44:52.763
-I--
-it's my fault, um...

44:52.941 --> 44:54.432
We were gonna match.

44:54.693 --> 44:58.118
Yeah, and I just refused
to wear a suit, 'cause, uh,

44:58.279 --> 45:00.195
That's what everyone else
is gonna wear.

45:00.281 --> 45:04.575
So, uh, lori loaned me this
instead.

45:04.744 --> 45:05.660
Was it a mistake?

45:05.912 --> 45:07.795
I mean, you said it yourself,
you need to move on.

45:07.872 --> 45:09.463
I'll change, yeah.

45:09.624 --> 45:10.581
No, I'll just run
back to the chi house

45:10.750 --> 45:12.099
And grab my toga.

45:12.168 --> 45:14.101
No, it's...It's fine.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.771
You just surprised me.

45:16.923 --> 45:19.273
Come on inside, we'll get you
something to drink.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.817
Drink what?

45:20.969 --> 45:22.652
I heard about
the no-alcohol rule.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.095
Yeah, exactly,

45:24.347 --> 45:25.679
Which is why I will be
keeping an eagle eye

45:25.681 --> 45:27.389
On everything
you drink tonight.

45:27.475 --> 45:30.743
Oh! Is this a party
or a day care?

45:30.812 --> 45:32.303
Oh, ha-ha.

45:32.480 --> 45:33.654
Yeah, just kidding.

45:33.773 --> 45:35.322
I can't wait
to have a juice box.

45:35.358 --> 45:38.550
All right. Let's go.

45:38.653 --> 45:40.736
Pineapple.

45:40.822 --> 45:45.649
(faint music,
indistinct chatter)

45:45.827 --> 45:48.786
It's a nice turnout.

45:48.997 --> 45:49.987
Come on, let's party it up,

45:50.248 --> 45:53.732
Since this will most likely be
my last greek formal ever.

45:53.918 --> 45:57.085
Why? You don't graduate
till next year.

45:57.088 --> 45:58.587
Yeah, about that.

45:58.631 --> 46:00.255
We got a notice
from our advisor

46:00.341 --> 46:02.349
That they are auditing
the chi house

46:02.351 --> 46:05.102
And may ban us
from the college.

46:05.180 --> 46:06.437
They can't do that.

46:06.514 --> 46:07.989
Of course they can.

46:08.183 --> 46:11.917
I mean, they got to set
an example for what happened.

46:12.103 --> 46:15.980
And they are practically
executing me for it.

46:16.191 --> 46:17.348
I could be suspended.

46:17.484 --> 46:21.260
What?

46:21.446 --> 46:28.283
Kaylee, um...
Wally died under my watch.

46:28.328 --> 46:29.877
I mean,
I'm the one responsible.

46:30.038 --> 46:34.873
I mean, kicking you out
won't bring him back.

46:34.876 --> 46:37.201
I mean, I deserve it.

46:37.462 --> 46:41.797
I mean, I mean...I was acting
like an arrogant jerk,

46:41.883 --> 46:45.801
And now I'm being
called out for it.

46:45.887 --> 46:48.745
So, here's to
the cancel culture.

46:48.932 --> 46:51.790
I won't just sit back
and let them crucify you.

46:51.935 --> 46:54.852
Okay?
Who do I need to talk to?

46:55.063 --> 46:56.354
You'd stand up for me?

46:56.564 --> 46:58.039
Yeah, of course I would.

46:58.107 --> 47:00.649
I know you'd do the same for me.

47:00.652 --> 47:03.135
(siren wailing)

47:03.279 --> 47:05.579
What are the police doing here?

47:05.615 --> 47:07.064
Not just the police.

47:07.242 --> 47:09.157
Look who's leading the charge.

47:09.244 --> 47:10.951
All right.
If the noise is too loud,

47:11.079 --> 47:13.246
I can--I can just get the kids
to turn it down for you.

47:13.498 --> 47:14.922
I'm more interested
in the alcohol

47:14.999 --> 47:16.740
You're serving to minors.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.076
No, ma'am,
it's not what you think.

47:19.212 --> 47:19.985
There she is.

47:20.129 --> 47:22.654
That's the one
I was telling you about.

47:22.882 --> 47:26.258
Uh, mrs. Lancaster,
we aren't doing anything wrong.

47:26.261 --> 47:27.159
Can we come inside?

47:27.387 --> 47:30.521
We received a report
about alcohol consumption.

47:30.557 --> 47:32.106
Who reported us?

47:32.183 --> 47:34.559
Kaylee, it's fine.

47:34.727 --> 47:36.227
Be my guest. Come inside.

47:36.387 --> 47:37.687
Wait.

47:37.939 --> 47:40.114
We won't just let you do
a witch hunt on our house.

47:40.233 --> 47:42.083
So you do have
something to hide.

47:42.110 --> 47:43.283
Hide what?

47:43.444 --> 47:46.571
My nephew's birthday party
was more scandalous than this

47:46.781 --> 47:49.181
And he's only five years old.

47:49.367 --> 47:51.868
Come on in,
I'll show you around.

48:07.635 --> 48:09.977
This war that you're
trying to start with me

48:10.054 --> 48:11.629
Has to stop, okay?

48:11.890 --> 48:14.098
It's one thing to attack me,
but now my house too?

48:14.392 --> 48:16.800
I'm surprised the house
isn't made out of gingerbread.

48:17.061 --> 48:20.121
Isn't that how witches like you
lure impressionable young boys

48:20.189 --> 48:22.123
Into your domain?

48:22.233 --> 48:24.792
Mrs. Lancaster,
this is hardly fair.

48:24.861 --> 48:26.160
And you, chase.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.661
My boy adored you,

48:27.739 --> 48:29.614
And to see you take her side...

48:29.782 --> 48:31.982
There's no side to take.

48:32.243 --> 48:35.277
What happened to wally
was a terrible accident.

48:35.330 --> 48:40.157
And that's all it was,
an accident.

48:40.418 --> 48:44.145
And how did the ghb
get in his system?

48:44.213 --> 48:46.338
Did you give it to him?

48:46.424 --> 48:49.583
Why are you so insistent
that wally was drugged?

48:49.886 --> 48:52.411
Because wally would never take
something like that on his own.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.305
And if you knew him
as well as you say you do,

48:54.474 --> 48:57.158
You'd already know that.

48:57.352 --> 49:01.646
Well, I also knew he was a guy
who sometimes took risks.

49:01.940 --> 49:07.926
Isn't that what college is for,
to make mistakes?

49:08.112 --> 49:12.006
The only risk he took
was meeting you.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.341
Mrs. Lancaster, that's enough.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.160
I'm only gonna warn you once.

49:16.371 --> 49:17.845
You cannot make
false accusations

49:17.956 --> 49:20.455
About other people like this.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.958
I had every reason to suspect
this woman was preying

49:23.002 --> 49:25.703
On more young men
like my son.

49:25.964 --> 49:28.355
Don't bring the law into it
unless you have proof,

49:28.424 --> 49:30.966
Legitimate proof.

49:31.010 --> 49:34.095
So there's no alcohol in there?

49:34.305 --> 49:36.597
No drugs of any kind?

49:36.808 --> 49:38.099
I think you should be happy.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.350
Obviously,
these kids are making sure

49:39.644 --> 49:42.895
Whatever happened to your son
doesn't happen to anyone else.

49:43.147 --> 49:44.438
I'm sure if you
give 'em a chance,

49:44.691 --> 49:50.144
You'll see these kids aren't
as bad as you think.

49:50.196 --> 49:53.497
Did wally really
take those drugs on his own?

49:53.658 --> 49:55.891
If he did, he wasn't
the son I thought he was,

49:56.160 --> 50:04.041
Just like my husband wasn't
the man I thought he was either.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.076
Sorry to bother you all.

50:06.295 --> 50:08.428
Please, carry on
with your evening.

50:08.464 --> 50:12.858
Mm-hm.

50:13.052 --> 50:15.510
Well, I'm gonna see if that
stone oven was worth repairing

50:15.513 --> 50:16.937
And make some pizza.

50:17.015 --> 50:19.848
You hungry?

50:19.851 --> 50:22.243
(indistinct chatter)

50:22.353 --> 50:26.622
(siren whoops, wails)

50:26.774 --> 50:31.418
Don't let mrs. Lancaster
get to you.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.587
She's just letting off steam.

50:33.781 --> 50:37.791
Well, it's hard when she's
trying to have me arrested.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.360
Come on. Let's go inside
and have an energy drink

50:40.496 --> 50:41.786
And get crazy.

50:41.831 --> 50:43.355
You can leave if you want.

50:43.541 --> 50:45.707
I know you think
this party is lame.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.034
Well, trust me.

50:47.253 --> 50:50.545
Any party that you're at
is definitely not lame.

50:50.548 --> 50:51.713
In fact, I'm gonna--

50:51.716 --> 50:53.240
(crash)

50:53.384 --> 50:55.042
Oh my god! Kaylee!

50:55.244 --> 51:03.017
Are you okay?

51:03.260 --> 51:14.779
I don't think anything
will ever be okay again.

51:14.939 --> 51:16.330
Bye!

51:16.365 --> 51:17.648
No! Don't leave.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.633
We're gonna make popcorn
and play games.

51:19.744 --> 51:21.168
Play games and make popcorn?

51:21.245 --> 51:22.744
When did you become my grandma?

51:22.747 --> 51:24.254
Come on! It'll be fun.

51:24.373 --> 51:26.173
The bars on congress street
are also fun.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.491
Come on, the night's young

51:27.752 --> 51:29.343
And I can't let
this outfit go to waste!

51:29.420 --> 51:31.645
All right. Have fun. Be good.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.847
I won't.

51:33.883 --> 51:47.144
-Bye!
-Bye.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.863
Looks like it's just you and me.

51:49.899 --> 51:51.031
It's only 10.

51:51.192 --> 51:55.035
I though people would
at least stay until midnight.

51:55.154 --> 51:57.838
Yeah, the alphas are
throwin' a kegger,

51:57.949 --> 52:02.367
And so are the sigmas
and the deltas.

52:02.495 --> 52:05.679
Well, I refuse to believe
that all anyone wants to do

52:05.790 --> 52:07.698
On greek row is drink beer.

52:07.875 --> 52:09.516
No, of course not.

52:09.627 --> 52:12.944
They also wanna smoke weed.

52:13.047 --> 52:14.188
Are you crazy?

52:14.298 --> 52:16.556
The cops were just here.

52:16.717 --> 52:19.710
So the chances of them
coming back are zero.

52:19.971 --> 52:22.513
Besides, it's only
a couple grams, it's legal.

52:22.723 --> 52:24.456
Oh, and since we're both 21,

52:24.642 --> 52:26.733
We can also partake
in some of this.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.476
No. No way.

52:28.604 --> 52:31.813
I don't wanna give sabrina any
reason to question my motives.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.466
Stuff like this
just gives her ammunition.

52:34.669 --> 52:38.386
(sighs)

52:38.489 --> 52:40.914
So...What?

52:41.033 --> 52:44.568
Am I just supposed
to drink more punch?

52:44.704 --> 52:46.537
Yeah.

52:46.697 --> 52:49.540
Fine.

52:49.709 --> 52:50.708
(liquid sloshing)

52:50.868 --> 52:52.543
Okay.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.061
Whoa!

52:54.088 --> 52:57.347
Mm-hm.

52:57.425 --> 52:59.491
-That's good.
-Okay.

52:59.594 --> 53:02.386
(glugging noises)

53:02.597 --> 53:04.254
Mm. This is what you wanted?

53:04.390 --> 53:05.739
Yeah.

53:05.850 --> 53:08.500
It is, actually, yeah.

53:08.561 --> 53:12.980
(giggling)

53:13.149 --> 53:14.531
My grandpa used to say,

53:14.692 --> 53:18.693
"you are nuttier
than a squirrel in heat."

53:18.821 --> 53:21.572
Uh, I'll just come back later
and clean up in here.

53:21.732 --> 53:24.758
(exclaims)

53:24.869 --> 53:27.328
(retreating footsteps)

53:35.213 --> 53:40.715
Uh...I thought...

53:40.718 --> 53:44.386
Do you like me?

53:44.472 --> 53:46.388
Yeah, I mean, we've been friends
for years.

53:46.390 --> 53:51.126
You know what I mean.

53:51.312 --> 53:54.154
I can't think about another guy
right now.

53:54.190 --> 53:57.657
It's too soon.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.068
Do you think

54:00.112 --> 54:03.054
If you and wally
had never met

54:03.241 --> 54:13.915
That you and I
would have a chance?

54:13.918 --> 54:15.008
(exclaims)

54:15.086 --> 54:16.584
Is it hot in here?

54:16.587 --> 54:18.586
Wow. That's original.

54:18.756 --> 54:21.072
No, really, are you--are you,
like, really hot right now?

54:21.259 --> 54:22.499
Mm-kay. If you think that's how

54:22.760 --> 54:24.318
You're gonna get me
out of my clothes, then--

54:24.428 --> 54:27.354
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?

54:27.390 --> 54:31.024
Yeah, just...

54:31.060 --> 54:33.010
Come on, kaylee.

54:33.229 --> 54:36.647
Why'd you never
give us a shot?

54:36.816 --> 54:39.032
Are your pupils dilated?

54:39.110 --> 54:42.002
Oh, you wanna play doctor now?

54:42.113 --> 54:43.837
I told you not to drink.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.613
I didn't drink.

54:45.741 --> 54:48.708
All I had was the punch
that you served me, kaylee.

54:48.744 --> 54:50.344
Promise.

54:50.413 --> 54:54.014
Been a good boy, I swear.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.607
Chase?

54:55.751 --> 54:57.884
Chase? Oh my god.
Chase. Chase!

54:57.962 --> 54:59.294
Help! Help!

54:59.297 --> 55:01.171
Chase, chase, chase.

55:01.332 --> 55:02.797
Call an ambulance!

55:02.800 --> 55:03.723
Oh my god.

55:03.759 --> 55:06.110
Chase?

55:06.220 --> 55:08.620
-What happened?
-I don't know.

55:08.764 --> 55:09.796
You're gonna be all right.

55:09.890 --> 55:19.839
Help!

55:20.042 --> 55:35.814
Help!

55:36.000 --> 55:38.742
I had no idea
chase was epileptic.

55:38.919 --> 55:40.985
I mean, that has to be it,
right?

55:41.172 --> 55:42.654
Unless he's allergic
to something.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.339
I mean, we did have crawfish
today.

55:44.342 --> 55:45.899
No way.

55:46.052 --> 55:49.419
I've seen chase eat way more
shellfish than that.

55:49.597 --> 55:51.722
Oh god, what is happening?

55:51.974 --> 55:55.075
I can't take it if something
happens to chase too.

55:55.186 --> 55:58.412
He'll be okay. He's strong.

55:58.481 --> 56:00.947
He'll get through this.

56:00.983 --> 56:01.915
Well, carolyn.

56:02.026 --> 56:05.619
You're just as worried
about chase as we are.

56:05.654 --> 56:07.754
'course I am.

56:07.865 --> 56:12.259
I'm part of this family too now,
aren't I?

56:12.370 --> 56:13.927
I need to get to the hospital.

56:14.038 --> 56:16.871
What, and sleep
on the hospital floor?

56:16.916 --> 56:18.082
There's nothing
you can do for chase

56:18.250 --> 56:20.784
That you can't do right here.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.027
Pray.

56:23.214 --> 56:26.790
It's better than
any prescription I know.

56:27.051 --> 56:29.126
I'll make some tea
to calm our nerves.

56:29.387 --> 56:35.148
I'll bet you by morning,
chase'll be good as new.

56:35.184 --> 56:37.184
(kaylee sighs)

56:49.990 --> 56:52.132
I'm sorry.

56:52.201 --> 56:54.952
I don't wanna wake up.

56:55.162 --> 56:58.730
Just be careful, kaylee.

56:58.874 --> 57:08.740
She's not who you think she is.

57:08.884 --> 57:24.772
She's not who you think she is.

57:24.774 --> 57:27.276
(birdsong)

57:35.202 --> 57:37.010
Kaylee! The police are here.

57:37.037 --> 57:38.269
What? Why?

57:38.372 --> 57:39.562
Something to do with chase.

57:39.748 --> 57:41.122
-Is he dead?
-No, he's in the hospital,

57:41.208 --> 57:43.466
But ryan said
he overdosed on ghb.

57:43.502 --> 57:44.501
(knocks)

57:44.712 --> 57:46.052
Excuse me. I need you

57:46.172 --> 57:47.629
To step out
so we can search this room.

57:47.715 --> 57:49.055
Why? She didn't do
anything wrong.

57:49.216 --> 57:51.717
Just do what he says.
He has a warrant.

58:00.686 --> 58:02.235
Why are you doing this?

58:02.396 --> 58:03.645
It's all right.
It will be over soon.

58:03.689 --> 58:13.638
What are they looking for?

58:13.782 --> 58:30.147
What are they looking for?

58:30.216 --> 58:32.432
What's in here?

58:32.551 --> 58:43.727
I don't know,
I've never seen that before.

58:43.896 --> 58:46.596
Positive for ghb.

58:46.774 --> 58:56.757
Is this your room?

58:56.784 --> 59:11.462
Is this your room?

59:11.549 --> 59:13.881
Kaylee quaid,
you're under arrest.

59:13.968 --> 59:17.611
You have the right
to remain silent.

59:17.763 --> 59:19.646
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

59:19.723 --> 59:21.539
In a court of law.

59:21.725 --> 59:22.966
You have the right
to an attorney.

59:23.185 --> 59:24.134
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

59:24.311 --> 59:29.989
One will be provided for you.

59:30.150 --> 59:40.074
Do you understand your rights
as I've read them to you?

59:40.160 --> 59:56.483
Do you understand your rights
as I've read them to you?

59:56.552 --> 59:59.319
Who did this to me, huh?

59:59.388 --> 1:00:01.412
I know it was one of you!

1:00:01.473 --> 1:00:02.856
Why?

1:00:03.017 --> 1:00:12.866
I love all of you,
I would never do anything!

1:00:13.027 --> 1:00:23.935
I love all of you,
I would never do anything!

1:00:24.038 --> 1:00:34.020
(faint wail of siren)

1:00:34.089 --> 1:00:52.372
(faint wail of siren)

1:00:52.399 --> 1:01:00.030
Mom.

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:06.152
I didn't do anything wrong.

1:01:06.288 --> 1:01:07.663
I believe you.

1:01:07.915 --> 1:01:09.923
Someone put
that stuff in my room.

1:01:10.084 --> 1:01:12.316
I told you not to join
that place, didn't I?

1:01:12.419 --> 1:01:14.928
(sobbing)

1:01:15.089 --> 1:01:18.431
You'll listen to me now,
follow my advice?

1:01:18.592 --> 1:01:22.010
I bailed you out,
so now we do things my way.

1:01:23.972 --> 1:01:30.702
But I brought you some clothes.

1:01:30.854 --> 1:01:32.896
So nothing will show
on your record

1:01:33.107 --> 1:01:35.065
And the evidence
is inadmissible

1:01:35.275 --> 1:01:37.024
Since it was found
in a room that

1:01:37.111 --> 1:01:38.402
All the girls
who live in that house

1:01:38.570 --> 1:01:40.529
Have access to.

1:01:40.781 --> 1:01:43.155
So I'm not being charged
with anything?

1:01:43.242 --> 1:01:44.699
If they wanna to charge you,
they have to

1:01:44.785 --> 1:01:46.743
Charge every sorority sister
in your house.

1:01:46.954 --> 1:01:49.871
It's an impossible case
to prove.

1:01:49.957 --> 1:01:53.541
So, who put the ghb in my room?

1:01:53.627 --> 1:01:55.543
-Who knows?
-And who cares?

1:01:55.587 --> 1:01:57.712
-I do.
-Not after today.

1:01:57.798 --> 1:01:59.622
Your days at that sorority
are over.

1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:02.717
Mom, someone tried to hurt me,

1:02:02.803 --> 1:02:04.310
And they did,
they got me arrested.

1:02:04.471 --> 1:02:06.045
Yeah, exactly,
which is why you should

1:02:06.265 --> 1:02:08.298
Stay clear
of that place forever.

1:02:08.559 --> 1:02:10.600
I have to agree with your mother
on this, kaylee.

1:02:10.811 --> 1:02:12.043
Out of sight and out of mind

1:02:12.229 --> 1:02:15.213
Is the best advice
I could give you.

1:02:15.315 --> 1:02:18.124
What about chase?

1:02:18.193 --> 1:02:19.443
You think he set you up?

1:02:19.653 --> 1:02:22.328
No, I--I wanna know how he is.

1:02:22.489 --> 1:02:24.664
Well, he's not dead,
which is good news for you

1:02:24.825 --> 1:02:28.226
Because a fatality could
crack this wide open again,

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:30.061
And then the prosecutor
wouldn't hesitate

1:02:30.205 --> 1:02:32.505
To go after every girl
in that house.

1:02:32.583 --> 1:02:34.916
So could he press charges?

1:02:35.002 --> 1:02:37.978
Possibly, although
he did make a statement

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:39.829
Swearing that
he believes you're innocent

1:02:40.007 --> 1:02:41.982
Of any wrongdoing.

1:02:42.050 --> 1:02:43.967
It's because he's a good friend.

1:02:44.178 --> 1:02:46.436
At least he has my back.

1:02:46.513 --> 1:02:48.138
Which he could stab at any time.

1:02:48.307 --> 1:02:49.689
-Mother.
-I'm just trying

1:02:49.850 --> 1:02:52.358
To spare you the pain
I went through when--

1:02:52.478 --> 1:02:54.418
When I dealt with
this kind of situation.

1:02:54.521 --> 1:02:55.479
What, how?

1:02:55.689 --> 1:02:57.588
I wasn't sexually harassed.

1:02:57.816 --> 1:03:00.984
Well, not yet, but maybe chase
was trying to give you the ghb

1:03:01.195 --> 1:03:02.936
And accidentally
drank it himself.

1:03:03.197 --> 1:03:06.022
Just because he's a man
doesn't mean he's a monster.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.991
I'm only trying to protect you.

1:03:08.202 --> 1:03:09.784
By making me think
that everyone I know

1:03:09.787 --> 1:03:10.860
Is out to get me?

1:03:11.038 --> 1:03:12.829
Well, somebody is.

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:15.790
I have told you,
"never trust anyone."

1:03:15.876 --> 1:03:17.775
Well, I don't wanna
live like that.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:21.946
Well, maybe
you don't have a choice.

1:03:22.049 --> 1:03:23.723
Kaylee?

1:03:23.884 --> 1:03:25.525
I came as soon as I heard
your mom bailed you out.

1:03:25.594 --> 1:03:27.177
I thought everyone abandoned me.

1:03:27.387 --> 1:03:29.303
No, all the girls
are worried sick.

1:03:29.389 --> 1:03:30.872
Even carolyn's a nervous wreck.

1:03:31.058 --> 1:03:33.049
But lori, not everyone
at the theta house

1:03:33.227 --> 1:03:34.308
Is worried about me.

1:03:34.394 --> 1:03:36.853
I mean, who tried
to set me up like that and why?

1:03:37.064 --> 1:03:38.355
Someone tried to kill chase.

1:03:38.565 --> 1:03:39.739
I don't know who is responsible,

1:03:39.900 --> 1:03:41.273
But we're all
about to pay the price.

1:03:41.318 --> 1:03:43.109
Did someone else get sick?

1:03:43.237 --> 1:03:45.653
No, the college is trying
to kick us off campus.

1:03:45.739 --> 1:03:47.305
The council called
an emergency meeting tonight

1:03:47.533 --> 1:03:49.366
To have theta's recognition
as an official sorority

1:03:49.576 --> 1:03:52.886
Of southern u
be pulled permanently.

1:03:52.996 --> 1:03:53.903
Chase said
they were trying to do

1:03:54.081 --> 1:03:55.588
The same thing to the chi house.

1:03:55.749 --> 1:03:57.207
The chis are fine now,
the pressure's off them

1:03:57.417 --> 1:03:59.834
And now all eyes are on us.

1:03:59.837 --> 1:04:01.260
Because of me.

1:04:01.338 --> 1:04:02.837
What time is the meeting?

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:04.597
Tonight at 6:30.

1:04:04.758 --> 1:04:06.099
Okay, we still have time--
did you drive here?

1:04:06.176 --> 1:04:07.934
Yeah, my car's in the lot.

1:04:08.095 --> 1:04:10.177
Let's go, we can't let
whoever's manipulating this

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:11.905
Get away with it.

1:04:12.057 --> 1:04:13.998
The only place you're going
is home with me.

1:04:14.101 --> 1:04:15.758
We had a deal.

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:18.595
Mom, I'm still the president
of my sorority.

1:04:18.856 --> 1:04:20.897
Okay, my sisters
are counting on me to help them.

1:04:21.149 --> 1:04:24.568
You don't have any sisters
and I count on you, too.

1:04:24.778 --> 1:04:26.936
I want you home with me.

1:04:27.114 --> 1:04:28.922
I can keep you safe.

1:04:29.116 --> 1:04:32.425
Well, and let whoever
did this to me get away with it

1:04:32.619 --> 1:04:36.187
And let my sisters pay for it
by being kicked off of campus?

1:04:36.373 --> 1:04:38.915
Mom, you didn't teach me
to give up.

1:04:39.126 --> 1:04:40.524
You taught me to fight back.

1:04:40.711 --> 1:04:43.544
Someone in that sorority
wants to hurt you.

1:04:43.630 --> 1:04:44.754
But a lot of people
in that sorority

1:04:44.923 --> 1:04:46.606
Also wanna protect her.

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:49.700
The sorority is strong,
we watch over each other,

1:04:49.803 --> 1:04:52.128
While we still have one.

1:04:52.306 --> 1:04:54.964
Mom, please,

1:04:55.225 --> 1:04:59.969
I have to go to this meeting
and fight for my sisters.

1:05:00.188 --> 1:05:01.971
Only person I thought
was more stubborn than me

1:05:02.107 --> 1:05:03.773
Was your father,

1:05:03.984 --> 1:05:06.793
But I can't say that anymore.

1:05:06.987 --> 1:05:08.903
You got more conviction
than both of your parents

1:05:08.906 --> 1:05:12.115
Put together.

1:05:12.284 --> 1:05:14.910
Well, go get 'em.

1:05:23.670 --> 1:05:26.846
Your grievance
isn't with the thetas.

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:29.482
Your grievance is with me,

1:05:29.676 --> 1:05:32.969
And while nothing in my life
has brought me as much joy

1:05:33.180 --> 1:05:36.306
As being a member of the thetas,

1:05:36.558 --> 1:05:39.358
I will revoke my sisterhood
if it will guarantee

1:05:39.478 --> 1:05:41.427
The rest of my sisters
can stay on campus

1:05:41.688 --> 1:05:44.188
And the sorority
won't lose its accreditation.

1:05:44.191 --> 1:05:45.982
What, kaylee?

1:05:46.193 --> 1:05:48.168
I won't let you do that.

1:05:48.362 --> 1:05:51.671
If me leaving means
you all get to stay, then--

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:54.340
Then I don't want to,

1:05:54.451 --> 1:05:57.844
Because that's not
the theta way.

1:05:57.955 --> 1:06:00.454
We have each others' backs,

1:06:00.457 --> 1:06:02.365
No matter what.

1:06:02.542 --> 1:06:04.459
You taught me that.

1:06:06.213 --> 1:06:08.630
I agree, if kaylee goes, I go.

1:06:13.679 --> 1:06:21.375
(indistinct whispering)

1:06:21.478 --> 1:06:23.986
(clearing throat)

1:06:24.064 --> 1:06:25.729
While the council appreciates

1:06:25.774 --> 1:06:30.185
The strong sense
of sisterhood...

1:06:30.237 --> 1:06:32.578
...We must also
take this as a sign

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:35.882
That you agree with
the unfortunate actions

1:06:35.993 --> 1:06:37.917
Kaylee quaid has committed,

1:06:38.036 --> 1:06:41.170
Specifically against
the chi fraternity.

1:06:41.248 --> 1:06:43.431
While this is not
criminal court,

1:06:43.583 --> 1:06:50.029
We must make an example
for our community.

1:06:50.090 --> 1:06:53.775
As of today, southern u
no longer recognizes theta house

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:56.018
As an accredited sorority.

1:06:56.179 --> 1:06:59.080
Every member of the theta house
must vacate within the next week

1:06:59.266 --> 1:07:02.224
Before the next sorority
takes ownership.

1:07:02.269 --> 1:07:04.644
This meeting is adjourned.

1:07:04.804 --> 1:07:06.445
(clacking)

1:07:06.447 --> 1:07:08.314
(shuffling)

1:07:08.442 --> 1:07:11.434
Do you all have any idea
what you just gave up?

1:07:11.695 --> 1:07:15.321
Do you know what we all gained
by standing with you?

1:07:15.482 --> 1:07:19.575
(sniffling)

1:07:19.578 --> 1:07:21.244
Don't.

1:07:21.455 --> 1:07:24.080
You'll just make things worse.

1:07:24.291 --> 1:07:28.634
I don't think that's possible.

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:31.304
Did you enjoy the show?

1:07:31.465 --> 1:07:32.805
Was it everything
you hoped it would be

1:07:32.966 --> 1:07:37.293
Or do you still want
a pound of flesh from me?

1:07:37.471 --> 1:07:40.588
I know you think I hurt wally,

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:42.215
But you are the one
who hurts him

1:07:42.350 --> 1:07:43.683
By standing there and gloating

1:07:43.977 --> 1:07:46.436
While the people who loved him
are being punished

1:07:46.646 --> 1:07:50.481
For a terrible accident.

1:07:50.484 --> 1:07:59.991
Let's go.

1:08:00.193 --> 1:08:02.560
(crickets chirping)

1:08:02.662 --> 1:08:12.653
(car beeping)

1:08:12.756 --> 1:08:24.765
(car beeping)

1:08:24.768 --> 1:08:34.684
(purse clinking)

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:45.436
(purse clinking)

1:08:45.539 --> 1:08:52.776
(purse clinking)

1:08:52.879 --> 1:08:55.129
(panting)

1:08:55.132 --> 1:09:00.042
Oh, god, oh, god.

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:01.619
Ah! Oh, oh.

1:09:01.721 --> 1:09:03.596
I--I think some--

1:09:03.798 --> 1:09:08.217
I--somebody was just--

1:09:08.353 --> 1:09:10.311
I'm sorry, I--

1:09:10.397 --> 1:09:20.229
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1:09:20.407 --> 1:10:08.452
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

1:10:08.496 --> 1:10:11.355
I guess this is goodbye,
for now.

1:10:11.458 --> 1:10:13.449
Yeah, I love you.

1:10:13.585 --> 1:10:15.042
I know, you too.

1:10:15.044 --> 1:10:16.360
Bye, girl.

1:10:16.463 --> 1:10:17.954
Wait, group hug.

1:10:18.197 --> 1:10:21.524
(chuckling)

1:10:21.635 --> 1:10:27.146
-Love you, guys.
-Love you.

1:10:27.265 --> 1:10:28.722
We don't need a sorority
to tell us

1:10:28.808 --> 1:10:30.407
How much we mean to each other.

1:10:30.409 --> 1:10:31.850
And if that council
doesn't like it,

1:10:31.978 --> 1:10:34.771
I can give 'em directions
on where to shove it.

1:10:34.981 --> 1:10:36.489
Aren't you leaving, too?

1:10:36.650 --> 1:10:38.399
Uh, I have some more stuff
to pack up,

1:10:38.485 --> 1:10:40.944
Plus, I wanna help carolyn
close up the house.

1:10:41.154 --> 1:10:43.470
I am still theta president
after all.

1:10:43.657 --> 1:10:45.739
You've always been
loyal to a fault.

1:10:45.825 --> 1:10:47.992
This house did not deserve you.

1:10:51.289 --> 1:10:53.248
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:10:59.798 --> 1:11:06.994
Mrs. Lancaster?

1:11:07.180 --> 1:11:09.639
You weren't
supposed to catch me.

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:11.857
What are you doing here?

1:11:11.893 --> 1:11:13.192
It's wally's phone.

1:11:13.270 --> 1:11:14.677
I was able to salvage it.

1:11:14.854 --> 1:11:16.420
I wanted the pictures off of it,

1:11:16.564 --> 1:11:18.164
But when I started
to go through them

1:11:18.358 --> 1:11:20.650
And saw that the main photo
was the two of you,

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:25.004
I realized it wasn't my place.

1:11:25.156 --> 1:11:27.991
I can't take his phone,
it's too personal.

1:11:28.201 --> 1:11:30.159
What's on here
was private to wally.

1:11:30.370 --> 1:11:31.828
Which is why
if anyone should have it,

1:11:31.997 --> 1:11:33.846
It should be you.

1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:36.790
I think now I know
why he was so special to you.

1:11:36.876 --> 1:11:39.836
I can see it
in the pictures he took.

1:11:40.088 --> 1:11:43.172
Anyway, I think you knew my son
better than I did

1:11:43.341 --> 1:11:45.374
This past year,

1:11:45.593 --> 1:11:48.210
And so whatever memories
are on that phone

1:11:48.388 --> 1:11:50.396
Of the two of you,

1:11:50.432 --> 1:11:52.806
They belong to you,

1:11:52.809 --> 1:12:02.800
Not me.

1:12:02.902 --> 1:12:09.973
Not me.

1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.368
Chase,
you're out of the hospital?

1:12:12.579 --> 1:12:13.736
Got out two days ago.

1:12:13.913 --> 1:12:15.813
How are you feeling?

1:12:15.999 --> 1:12:19.742
Still a bit dizzy,
but doc says it'll pass.

1:12:19.919 --> 1:12:21.744
How are you?

1:12:21.921 --> 1:12:24.714
That's a loaded question.

1:12:24.924 --> 1:12:26.749
I know you got arrested.

1:12:26.885 --> 1:12:28.492
Was it scary?

1:12:28.595 --> 1:12:29.919
Terrifying

1:12:30.055 --> 1:12:32.513
And humiliating.

1:12:32.599 --> 1:12:34.498
Well, at least
they didn't convict you.

1:12:34.726 --> 1:12:36.667
That detective tried to get me
to press charges against you,

1:12:36.853 --> 1:12:40.730
But I know you'd never
drug me on purpose.

1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:45.902
I'm just glad it's over.

1:12:46.071 --> 1:12:47.753
Can I help you pack up?

1:12:47.822 --> 1:12:50.423
That's nice, but why?

1:12:50.617 --> 1:12:52.909
You don't get volunteer points
for packing up a sorority

1:12:53.119 --> 1:12:55.778
That just lost
its accreditation.

1:12:55.997 --> 1:12:57.580
Wasn't that long ago
I thought my house

1:12:57.874 --> 1:13:00.750
Would be the one shutting down
and I'd be kicked off campus,

1:13:00.919 --> 1:13:03.861
But...Instead it's you.

1:13:03.963 --> 1:13:06.547
(birds chirping)

1:13:06.591 --> 1:13:09.258
Well, what's done is done,

1:13:09.469 --> 1:13:12.811
And dwelling on it
won't fix anything.

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:14.764
I'm just glad you're okay.

1:13:14.974 --> 1:13:16.516
That's all that matters.

1:13:30.490 --> 1:13:34.833
Ah, isn't moving depressing?

1:13:34.994 --> 1:13:36.652
I'm gonna make some tea
to lighten the mood.

1:13:36.788 --> 1:13:37.895
You want some?

1:13:38.039 --> 1:13:39.913
Sure, and put this guy to work.

1:13:40.041 --> 1:13:42.975
He came by to help us
pack up the rest of the house.

1:13:43.128 --> 1:13:44.627
Chase, are you sure
you're in the right condition

1:13:44.838 --> 1:13:46.178
To help us play moving day?

1:13:46.339 --> 1:13:50.015
Oh, yeah, um,
doc says that I'm fine,

1:13:50.176 --> 1:13:52.985
And besides, I mean,
I owe you ladies my life.

1:13:53.179 --> 1:13:54.578
If you hadn't called
the ambulance when you did--

1:13:54.764 --> 1:13:56.973
I can't handle
any more "what ifs."

1:13:57.183 --> 1:13:58.749
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

1:13:58.893 --> 1:14:00.326
Oh, you need help
boxing your things?

1:14:00.437 --> 1:14:02.936
No, just let me cry in peace

1:14:03.022 --> 1:14:05.347
As I pack away
my special memories.

1:14:05.525 --> 1:14:08.091
(footfalls thudding)

1:14:08.236 --> 1:14:20.362
So, what else needs to be done?

1:14:20.540 --> 1:14:26.702
(exhaling heavily)

1:14:26.921 --> 1:14:32.675
You always took
the best pictures of us, wally.

1:14:32.927 --> 1:14:35.536
Chase, come up here,
I wanna show you something.

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:38.139
Okay, I'll be up in a sec.

1:14:43.062 --> 1:14:46.480
Oh, careful, oh, my god.

1:14:46.566 --> 1:14:50.300
Get that out of here, man,
get that thing--

1:14:50.403 --> 1:14:52.561
Where are we going, man?

1:14:52.697 --> 1:14:55.322
You're crazy.

1:14:55.325 --> 1:14:56.640
Not in your face.

1:14:56.743 --> 1:14:58.308
What the heck?

1:14:58.495 --> 1:14:59.535
I said get that thing
out of here!

1:14:59.746 --> 1:15:01.220
All right, all right.

1:15:01.289 --> 1:15:03.313
Jesus, man, that hurt.

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:05.057
You don't trust me.

1:15:05.168 --> 1:15:06.316
What are you talking about?

1:15:06.461 --> 1:15:07.743
I said you don't trust me.

1:15:07.921 --> 1:15:10.337
I trust you, chase.

1:15:10.340 --> 1:15:12.322
Okay, prove it.

1:15:12.425 --> 1:15:14.083
-Prove it?
-Yeah.

1:15:14.260 --> 1:15:16.235
Isn't that why I'm down here?

1:15:16.429 --> 1:15:18.604
You're making me wonder why--
why you're even here, man.

1:15:18.723 --> 1:15:21.090
-You committed?
-Yeah, of course.

1:15:21.267 --> 1:15:22.575
Dude, what are you doing?

1:15:22.685 --> 1:15:24.093
I wanna show you something.

1:15:24.270 --> 1:15:27.854
Oh, what do you have in store?

1:15:27.857 --> 1:15:28.931
What the heck?

1:15:29.108 --> 1:15:35.621
Going into your dungeon, man.

1:15:35.657 --> 1:15:38.107
(clattering)

1:15:38.284 --> 1:15:40.409
What the hell
is happening?

1:15:40.620 --> 1:15:44.021
You may as well trust me, man.

1:15:44.207 --> 1:15:46.799
Chase, chase,
where is everybody?

1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:50.603
Isn't this supposed to be
some initiation thing?

1:15:50.713 --> 1:15:52.621
-Try some of this.
-What's that?

1:15:52.799 --> 1:15:54.123
Oh, you'll like it.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:55.958
What is it?

1:15:56.094 --> 1:15:57.384
I don't want it.

1:15:57.387 --> 1:15:58.611
(bottle clinking)

1:15:58.721 --> 1:16:00.096
It'll make you feel better.

1:16:00.306 --> 1:16:00.946
-No, I don't want it!
-It'll make me

1:16:01.015 --> 1:16:02.314
Feel better, come on!

1:16:02.350 --> 1:16:03.816
Dude!

1:16:03.851 --> 1:16:06.893
(shuffling)

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:08.637
Hey, stop!

1:16:08.773 --> 1:16:10.289
Stop!

1:16:10.316 --> 1:16:17.813
(clattering)

1:16:17.949 --> 1:16:24.287
Stop!

1:16:24.497 --> 1:16:30.584
Kaylee, what are you looking at?

1:16:30.670 --> 1:16:32.795
What are you doing
on wally's phone?

1:16:33.006 --> 1:16:35.231
Thought it was broken.

1:16:35.341 --> 1:16:37.591
How could you do that to him?

1:16:37.677 --> 1:16:40.469
Kaylee, you need to
give me that phone.

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:42.763
That video shouldn't even exist.

1:16:42.849 --> 1:16:46.008
I didn't know he was recording.

1:16:46.185 --> 1:16:48.602
You gave him the ghb

1:16:48.605 --> 1:16:51.147
So you could--

1:16:51.357 --> 1:16:53.031
How could you do that to him?

1:16:53.192 --> 1:16:55.351
We got out of control,
it's not what you think.

1:16:55.528 --> 1:16:58.370
And what do I think?

1:16:58.406 --> 1:17:00.339
It was you.

1:17:00.491 --> 1:17:02.449
You set me up,
you put the ghb in the punch

1:17:02.493 --> 1:17:04.042
And you hid it in my room!

1:17:04.203 --> 1:17:05.511
They were gonna
kick me out of school

1:17:05.663 --> 1:17:08.364
If they found out
that I gave wally the ghb!

1:17:08.541 --> 1:17:11.000
And sabrina, if she found out,

1:17:11.252 --> 1:17:12.701
She would think
that was the reason why he died

1:17:12.879 --> 1:17:14.337
And try to throw me in prison!

1:17:14.547 --> 1:17:15.871
Are you the reason he died?

1:17:16.049 --> 1:17:17.723
'course not!

1:17:17.884 --> 1:17:19.558
You were there, it was just
some stupid accident!

1:17:19.677 --> 1:17:21.059
An accident
that wouldn't have happened

1:17:21.220 --> 1:17:23.512
If wally's judgment
wasn't impaired by you!

1:17:23.723 --> 1:17:25.348
What you made him drink
made him do!

1:17:25.558 --> 1:17:27.641
I didn't want wally to die!

1:17:27.727 --> 1:17:31.387
I loved that kid
like my own brother!

1:17:31.522 --> 1:17:34.907
This is love?

1:17:34.942 --> 1:17:36.983
You're sick, chase.

1:17:37.070 --> 1:17:38.577
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:41.030
Just what you did to him!

1:17:41.324 --> 1:17:43.114
Where you going, kaylee?
You need to give me that phone!

1:17:43.117 --> 1:17:50.656
Stop!

1:17:50.816 --> 1:17:54.676
(panting)

1:17:54.712 --> 1:17:55.795
Call the police.

1:17:55.955 --> 1:17:57.213
What?

1:17:57.423 --> 1:17:58.673
Chase is the one
who gave wally the ghb.

1:17:58.925 --> 1:18:00.082
He's the one
who put it in my room,

1:18:00.259 --> 1:18:01.417
It's been him all along.

1:18:01.594 --> 1:18:04.937
-You sure?
-Kaylee!

1:18:04.939 --> 1:18:06.155
Don't go.

1:18:06.224 --> 1:18:07.689
I'm calling the police.

1:18:07.809 --> 1:18:09.274
In fact, I'm gonna
go to the station right now

1:18:09.352 --> 1:18:11.443
And show them this myself.

1:18:11.479 --> 1:18:15.698
(shattering)

1:18:15.700 --> 1:18:18.100
Carolyn, move,
I need to get to the police.

1:18:18.277 --> 1:18:19.785
I'm sorry, kaylee,

1:18:19.946 --> 1:18:23.121
But that would get my brother
in a lot of trouble,

1:18:23.282 --> 1:18:26.801
And I've worked too hard
to let that happen now.

1:18:26.828 --> 1:18:27.952
(grunting)

1:18:41.926 --> 1:18:51.875
(water burbling)

1:18:51.978 --> 1:19:05.647
(water burbling)

1:19:05.783 --> 1:19:07.666
Chase.

1:19:07.744 --> 1:19:10.486
Chase, help me, please.

1:19:10.621 --> 1:19:13.122
I'm so sorry.

1:19:13.291 --> 1:19:15.732
I wish I could,

1:19:15.918 --> 1:19:19.462
But she would
get so mad at me if I did.

1:19:19.622 --> 1:19:21.814
Who?

1:19:21.841 --> 1:19:27.419
My sister.

1:19:27.680 --> 1:19:33.309
Go downstairs
and don't let anybody in.

1:19:33.519 --> 1:19:35.661
What are you gonna do?

1:19:35.730 --> 1:19:37.513
Are you questioning me?

1:19:37.690 --> 1:19:39.589
-No, no.
-Chase,

1:19:39.692 --> 1:19:41.517
Are you still in the school?

1:19:41.736 --> 1:19:44.953
Did I make sure
you didn't get arrested?

1:19:45.031 --> 1:19:48.206
So show some gratitude.

1:19:48.367 --> 1:19:50.342
If you want your life
to remain the way it is

1:19:50.495 --> 1:19:52.161
And not spend
the next 10 years in prison,

1:19:52.371 --> 1:19:55.297
You'll leave, close the door,

1:19:55.374 --> 1:19:56.965
And not worry about
what I have to do in here

1:19:57.043 --> 1:19:58.250
To keep you out of trouble.

1:19:58.461 --> 1:20:00.335
Isn't that why I came here?

1:20:00.379 --> 1:20:10.362
To help you?

1:20:10.389 --> 1:20:16.519
To help you?

1:20:16.687 --> 1:20:23.876
(door latching)

1:20:24.028 --> 1:20:28.564
Why didn't you tell me
you were his sister?

1:20:28.741 --> 1:20:30.199
And let all my kittens
out of the bag

1:20:30.409 --> 1:20:32.384
Just to raise suspicion?

1:20:32.411 --> 1:20:34.887
(chuckling)

1:20:34.914 --> 1:20:36.321
Come on.

1:20:36.582 --> 1:20:40.242
The thick accent,
the whole southern belle act.

1:20:40.503 --> 1:20:43.987
I'm actually surprised
you didn't figure it out sooner.

1:20:44.173 --> 1:20:46.415
You don't have
the same last name.

1:20:46.592 --> 1:20:48.584
Mm, I was married.

1:20:48.761 --> 1:20:50.219
But you're so much--

1:20:50.388 --> 1:20:52.421
So much older than him.

1:20:52.598 --> 1:20:55.224
Different mothers.

1:20:55.434 --> 1:20:59.019
I practically raised chase.

1:20:59.105 --> 1:21:01.914
Promised I'd always
look out for him.

1:21:02.024 --> 1:21:03.749
Lordy, did he ever
test my patience

1:21:03.818 --> 1:21:07.619
And put that vow to the test.

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:14.243
Be careful what you promise
to do for others.

1:21:14.453 --> 1:21:18.447
You were in on this
the whole time?

1:21:18.624 --> 1:21:20.540
And it was working,

1:21:20.626 --> 1:21:22.918
Until you kissed and made up
with wally's mother

1:21:23.129 --> 1:21:27.256
And she gave you that phone.

1:21:27.416 --> 1:21:29.625
You see,

1:21:29.844 --> 1:21:33.596
Just as wally
was very precious to you,

1:21:33.806 --> 1:21:36.448
Chase means everything to me.

1:21:36.559 --> 1:21:37.983
He is the only family I have

1:21:38.144 --> 1:21:40.135
And I won't let
anything bad happen to him.

1:21:40.313 --> 1:21:41.954
Do you understand?

1:21:41.981 --> 1:21:44.023
You're sick.

1:21:44.183 --> 1:21:45.916
No, honey,

1:21:45.985 --> 1:21:48.310
I'm smart.

1:21:48.446 --> 1:21:50.570
Unfortunately you're not,

1:21:50.656 --> 1:21:54.399
And that's why
we have to do this.

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:58.454
Do you wanna make the first cut
or should I?

1:21:58.664 --> 1:22:01.064
I never did anything to you.

1:22:01.167 --> 1:22:03.626
I know.

1:22:03.836 --> 1:22:05.677
That's why I feel really bad.

1:22:05.796 --> 1:22:07.763
You really are
such a sweet girl.

1:22:07.798 --> 1:22:10.073
Come on.

1:22:10.176 --> 1:22:12.267
(spitting)

1:22:12.269 --> 1:22:13.660
Bitch!

1:22:13.763 --> 1:22:16.171
(sobbing)

1:22:16.349 --> 1:22:17.506
Need you to take this knife

1:22:17.683 --> 1:22:20.433
And I need you to kill yourself.

1:22:20.519 --> 1:22:22.344
A suicide makes the most sense.

1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:23.829
-No.
-Yes.

1:22:23.940 --> 1:22:26.665
You don't have to
be alone anymore.

1:22:26.734 --> 1:22:29.501
You can be with wally.

1:22:29.695 --> 1:22:32.095
Come on, this is just easy
for everyone involved.

1:22:32.198 --> 1:22:34.523
Don't you agree?

1:22:34.659 --> 1:22:35.949
Come on.

1:22:35.952 --> 1:22:38.360
-Come on!
-No.

1:22:38.496 --> 1:22:41.062
Fine, I'll help.

1:22:41.064 --> 1:22:42.864
Hold still.

1:22:43.042 --> 1:22:45.233
(shrieking)

1:22:45.378 --> 1:22:47.027
(indistinct remarks)

1:22:47.088 --> 1:22:50.046
(grunting)

1:22:50.049 --> 1:22:55.902
(panting)

1:22:55.904 --> 1:23:00.491
(panting)

1:23:00.559 --> 1:23:03.059
(grunting)

1:23:03.062 --> 1:23:12.569
(panting)

1:23:12.571 --> 1:23:15.472
(panting)

1:23:15.574 --> 1:23:17.974
(grunting)

1:23:18.077 --> 1:23:28.093
(groaning)

1:23:28.095 --> 1:23:34.591
(groaning)

1:23:34.593 --> 1:23:37.093
(grunting)

1:23:37.096 --> 1:23:46.812
(panting)

1:23:46.972 --> 1:23:49.839
(grunting)

1:23:50.042 --> 1:23:51.858
(thudding)

1:23:51.861 --> 1:24:01.985
(panting)

1:24:01.987 --> 1:24:11.044
(panting)

1:24:11.047 --> 1:24:19.477
(panting)

1:24:19.513 --> 1:24:30.806
(labored breathing)

1:24:30.983 --> 1:24:33.658
-Ah!
-Kaylee, are you here?

1:24:33.736 --> 1:24:35.586
We're going to get drinks.

1:24:35.738 --> 1:24:37.813
Did you text this,
did you text her?

1:24:37.990 --> 1:24:39.615
Yeah, two hours ago, nothing.

1:24:39.825 --> 1:24:40.949
Maybe her phone died and she's--

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.725
But her car's parked outside.

1:24:42.912 --> 1:24:44.586
So? My car's parked
at my parents' house

1:24:44.663 --> 1:24:46.079
And I'm not there.

1:24:46.165 --> 1:24:48.414
Come on, I wanna
go down to mcward's.

1:24:48.501 --> 1:24:54.671
Okay, fine, whatever, her loss.

1:24:54.873 --> 1:24:57.565
(grunting)

1:24:57.567 --> 1:25:01.753
(shrieking)

1:25:01.913 --> 1:25:08.952
(thudding)

1:25:09.021 --> 1:25:21.115
(panting)

1:25:21.275 --> 1:25:22.925
(clanking)

1:25:22.952 --> 1:25:24.125
Help!

1:25:24.161 --> 1:25:36.705
Someone help me!

1:25:36.841 --> 1:25:38.172
Ahh, no!

1:25:38.217 --> 1:25:40.141
(labored breathing)

1:25:40.177 --> 1:25:41.677
No, ahh!

1:25:41.887 --> 1:25:43.779
You crossed the line, kaylee.

1:25:43.889 --> 1:25:45.864
You killed my sister.

1:25:45.933 --> 1:25:48.233
You ruined everything!

1:25:48.352 --> 1:25:50.735
We could've been
so happy together.

1:25:50.813 --> 1:25:52.187
We could've had it all,

1:25:52.398 --> 1:25:54.314
And now we have nothing!

1:25:54.316 --> 1:25:55.965
(grunting)

1:25:56.068 --> 1:25:57.800
(gasping)

1:25:57.903 --> 1:25:59.469
(panting)

1:25:59.530 --> 1:26:00.970
You?

1:26:01.157 --> 1:26:02.881
You screwed
with the wrong sister.

1:26:02.908 --> 1:26:04.557
(thudding)

1:26:04.618 --> 1:26:06.985
(groaning)

1:26:07.121 --> 1:26:09.905
(labored breathing)

1:26:10.082 --> 1:26:11.848
Stop, chase, enough!

1:26:11.917 --> 1:26:14.059
(panting)

1:26:14.170 --> 1:26:16.486
-You saved me.
-Of course I did.

1:26:16.672 --> 1:26:17.746
Isn't that what
a little's supposed to do

1:26:17.923 --> 1:26:19.322
For her big sister?

1:26:19.425 --> 1:26:21.024
(panting)

1:26:21.093 --> 1:26:31.109
(grunting)

1:26:31.111 --> 1:26:35.939
(grunting)

1:26:36.275 --> 1:26:39.276
Speech, speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech, speech,

1:26:39.612 --> 1:26:42.303
Speech, speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech, speech,

1:26:42.305 --> 1:26:43.429
Speech, speech, speech, speech--

1:26:43.574 --> 1:26:46.524
Hey, hey, hey, quiet down!

1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:48.026
That's more like it.

1:26:48.287 --> 1:26:51.871
It's about time you respected
your new house mom.

1:26:51.916 --> 1:26:53.856
So now can we all
hear my daughter

1:26:53.959 --> 1:26:55.617
Give her speech?

1:26:55.753 --> 1:27:00.188
(birds chirping)

1:27:00.299 --> 1:27:02.223
"sorority sisters
are the siblings

1:27:02.259 --> 1:27:04.151
God forgot to give us."

1:27:04.303 --> 1:27:05.928
Now I didn't
come up with that saying,

1:27:06.096 --> 1:27:07.720
But it holds true

1:27:07.806 --> 1:27:10.465
To how I feel about all of you.

1:27:10.643 --> 1:27:13.134
Last year
we almost lost our sorority,

1:27:13.270 --> 1:27:15.804
But we fought, literally,

1:27:15.981 --> 1:27:17.655
To keep it.

1:27:17.775 --> 1:27:20.233
Thank you
for giving me a family.

1:27:20.319 --> 1:27:23.052
I will cherish
all of you forever.

1:27:23.239 --> 1:27:25.905
Now before I run off
to law school,

1:27:25.991 --> 1:27:29.051
Can we say our theta chant
one more time?

1:27:29.161 --> 1:27:31.152
Because it's not just a rhyme,

1:27:31.330 --> 1:27:35.198
It's a battle cry.

1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.151
Ahh!

1:27:38.312 --> 1:27:40.003
T-h-e-t-a,

1:27:40.172 --> 1:27:41.988
One heart, one way!

1:27:42.049 --> 1:27:43.573
T-h-e-t-a,

1:27:43.717 --> 1:27:45.650
We are thetas all the way!

1:27:45.678 --> 1:27:47.201
T-h-e-t-a,

1:27:47.346 --> 1:27:49.078
One heart, one way!

1:27:49.181 --> 1:27:50.672
T-h-e-t-a,

1:27:50.849 --> 1:27:52.516
We are thetas all the way!

1:27:52.685 --> 1:27:55.018
Go-o-o-o!
