WEBVTT

00:02.455 --> 00:03.831
I love the scholastic decathlon.

00:03.914 --> 00:05.414
It's the only
event where knowing

00:05.497 --> 00:06.789
the blood type of
all the presidents

00:06.872 --> 00:09.747
doesn't make me a freak,
it makes me an athlete.

00:09.872 --> 00:11.580
And I love the
athletic decathlon

00:11.664 --> 00:13.622
because, you know,
I'm an actual athlete

00:13.706 --> 00:15.956
who doesn't know the
blood types of presidents.

00:16.039 --> 00:19.455
[Milo] "Athledecamathelon?"
What is that?

00:19.539 --> 00:20.998
Well, "Athle-" means sports,

00:21.081 --> 00:23.289
but then "math"...

00:23.372 --> 00:25.914
[imitates explosion]
Mind blown, man.

00:25.998 --> 00:27.372
Let's ask Mr. Drako.

00:27.455 --> 00:28.914
Mr. Drako is a...

00:30.372 --> 00:32.789
-Vampeer.
-Chad, he's not a vampire.

00:32.872 --> 00:34.789
No. Vampeer.

00:34.872 --> 00:36.998
-He just has a widow's peak.
-And he's pale.

00:37.081 --> 00:38.622
And he has that accent.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.956
And we've never seen his
reflection in the mirror.

00:41.039 --> 00:43.248
I've never seen your
reflection in a mirror, Chad.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.706
Oh, no! I'm a vampire!

00:44.789 --> 00:45.789
[screaming]

00:53.747 --> 00:54.580
Hello, children.

00:58.664 --> 01:00.206
[whispering] Psst!
Chad was right.

01:00.289 --> 01:01.664
He has all his mirrors covered.

01:01.747 --> 01:03.914
[Melissa] He's not a vampire.

01:03.998 --> 01:06.831
Mr. Drako, why do you have
all your mirrors covered?

01:06.914 --> 01:08.206
Oh, those aren't mirrors.

01:08.289 --> 01:09.872
They're pictures of my ex-wife.

01:09.956 --> 01:11.622
Stop looking at me, Agnes!

01:11.706 --> 01:12.747
Why don't you just
take them down?

01:12.831 --> 01:14.664
Then where would
I hang my sheets?

01:14.747 --> 01:18.998
Um, we wanted to find out
about this Athledecamathelon.

01:19.081 --> 01:20.747
Funny story. The school district

01:20.831 --> 01:22.580
wasted a lot of money
buying that yacht.

01:23.747 --> 01:24.872
So now we have to combine

01:24.956 --> 01:28.039
your scholastic and athletic
decathlons into one event.

01:28.123 --> 01:29.664
Which shouldn't be a problem

01:29.747 --> 01:32.497
if you're great at all
sports and all academics.

01:32.580 --> 01:35.789
No fair! Who's good at
academics and sports?

01:35.872 --> 01:37.747
-Abraham Lincoln.
-Blood type A.

01:39.998 --> 01:41.914
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy,

01:41.998 --> 01:43.455
is this a legal, medical,

01:43.539 --> 01:45.248
or state emergency
level problem?

01:45.330 --> 01:47.580
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
Milo just forgot his lunch.

01:47.664 --> 01:48.998
And his body armor.

01:49.081 --> 01:50.622
I thought he looked
svelter today.

01:51.789 --> 01:53.831
-Ah, memories.
-Little help!

01:53.914 --> 01:56.248
You know, they put in those
reinforced steel beams because of me.

01:56.330 --> 01:57.914
And these unbreakable windows.

01:57.998 --> 02:00.330
Hey, I wonder if they've still
got my old trophy around here.

02:00.414 --> 02:02.956
You never told me
you won a trophy.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.289

was a rock band on the field?

that Mr. Drako really is a vampire.

How can he be a vampire?

02:45.039 --> 02:46.747
He's outside in the daylight.

With an umbrella hat and a
huge amount of sunscreen.

You can't be too
careful about the sun.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.956
Mr. Drako,
combining these two events

as you are.

You are going down, Geckos.

What do you know?

Murray the Middleman,

that sounds kind of impressive.

03:23.998 --> 03:26.622
They're totally prepared.
How is that possible?

03:26.706 --> 03:28.330
Well, the Athledecamathelon

03:28.414 --> 03:29.622
was announced three months ago.

03:29.706 --> 03:32.706
You've known about this for three
months and you didn't tell us!

I didn't want you
to be freaking out.

03:34.664 --> 03:35.789
Like you obviously are.

03:35.872 --> 03:37.956
And you just found out about
it, just now!

to show me the trophy.

But I'll accept the answer.

05:30.081 --> 05:32.455
And now for the physical
portion of your challenge.

Mmm, that can happen. Yeah.

And that's gonna leave a mess.

Yep. Yep.

You can't possibly
expect us to continue!

06:05.956 --> 06:07.956
All right,
everyone in favor of giving up,

06:08.039 --> 06:09.872
give me five dollars
then walk off the field.

06:09.956 --> 06:11.330
What's the five dollars for?

06:11.414 --> 06:13.664
Are you gonna ask questions
or are you gonna walk?

06:13.747 --> 06:16.081
No. Everybody, wait!
Don't you see?

06:16.164 --> 06:19.081
Before, we were playing
on a uneven playing field,

06:19.164 --> 06:20.831
it was physically even,

06:20.914 --> 06:22.539
but it was figuratively uneven

06:22.622 --> 06:25.206
because the Middlemen had time
to practice and we didn't.

06:25.289 --> 06:27.872
But now the field
is literally uneven,

06:27.956 --> 06:30.081
which makes it
figuratively even for us

06:30.164 --> 06:32.622
because I've spent
my entire life

06:32.706 --> 06:35.164
learning to deal with
things that are uneven.

06:35.248 --> 06:36.330
Physically!

06:36.414 --> 06:38.664
None of these guys have had
to deal with Murphy's Law.

06:38.747 --> 06:39.747
I have!

06:39.831 --> 06:41.206
Which means that we have!

06:41.289 --> 06:43.081
Are you with me?

06:43.164 --> 06:45.206
I didn't really get all of that,
but you look really confident,

06:45.289 --> 06:47.081
so I'm willing to give it a try.

06:47.164 --> 06:47.998

money for all that,

[all] Oh!

09:41.248 --> 09:43.706
My trivial knowledge
may seem selective.

Aw, man.

09:47.164 --> 09:48.164

10:00.455 --> 10:02.372
You don't want to keep
looking for your trophy?

10:02.455 --> 10:04.580
Nah, I think we have a
new hero in the family.

10:04.664 --> 10:07.831
Aw. You'll always be my hero.
