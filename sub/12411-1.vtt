- The commission's gonna vote next March.

except Senator Calvin Baynard.

I tried to bribe that son of a bitch, Joe.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.843
He gave it back because it wasn't enough.

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.930
- What's he want?
- Six million.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:48.767
Or he'll go straight to the police.

to kill that son of a bitch.

for the senator's murder.

my firm belief in what's best for the sport.
