(  roaring  )

00:05.208 --> 00:07.208
(  dramatic music playing  )

00:16.250 --> 00:18.458
Will someone please explain

00:16.250 --> 00:18.458
to me why we have to watch

00:18.500 --> 00:20.959
some silly monster movie

00:18.500 --> 00:20.959
at the drive-in?

00:21.041 --> 00:22.500
It is freezing outside.

00:22.542 --> 00:24.417
Excuse me.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.208
Attack of Humungado  is not

00:24.458 --> 00:28.208
just any silly monster movie.

00:28.250 --> 00:29.875
It's a kaiju classic.

00:29.917 --> 00:32.125
Which means it was made

00:29.917 --> 00:32.125
to be seen in a drive-in.

00:32.166 --> 00:35.250
Big screen, lots of snacks

00:32.166 --> 00:35.250
and no talking!

00:36.583 --> 00:38.542
Nothing better

00:36.583 --> 00:38.542
than movie popcorn.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.125
Just be sure none of it

00:38.583 --> 00:41.125
falls under my seat.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.417
Sometimes old technology

00:41.166 --> 00:43.417
is the best.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.834
Watching on film,

00:43.458 --> 00:45.834
run through a projector.

00:45.875 --> 00:49.125
Yep. Makes you feel connected

00:45.875 --> 00:49.125
with the movie's history.

00:49.166 --> 00:51.667
BLADES:

00:49.166 --> 00:51.667
Ha, ha, ha. Ancient history.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.834
Look at how fake

00:51.709 --> 00:53.834
the monsters look.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.542
I've cleaned scarier stuff

00:53.875 --> 00:56.542
off of my windshield.

01:01.291 --> 01:03.750
he doesn't have to go toe to toe

01:01.291 --> 01:03.750
with Humungado.

01:03.792 --> 01:05.375
His yellow belly would be

01:05.417 --> 01:07.542
the perfect target

01:05.417 --> 01:07.542
for a fireball.

01:07.583 --> 01:09.166
My belly's not yellow!

01:09.208 --> 01:11.208
It's sky blue,

01:09.208 --> 01:11.208
thank you very much.

01:11.250 --> 01:13.667
Guys, If you all

01:11.250 --> 01:13.667
don't stop bickering,

you're gonna miss the movie.

Oh...

03:40.709 --> 03:44.208
Come on, Mr. Bunty,

03:40.709 --> 03:44.208
we'll get you to a doctor.

Hard to tell

03:59.083 --> 04:00.792
there was even a fire.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.542
Good work, Cody.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.542
All right, ready for the roof.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

04:11.250 --> 04:14.917
Thank you. The old girl's

04:11.250 --> 04:14.917
never looked better.

04:14.959 --> 04:17.709
Wish I could say the same

04:14.959 --> 04:17.709
for my projector.

Sorry, Mr. Bunty.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.542
Using the same technology

04:26.667 --> 04:29.542
as the imaging chamber,

04:29.583 --> 04:32.542
I've created

04:29.583 --> 04:32.542
a holomorphic projector.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.792
It recalibrates

04:32.583 --> 04:34.792
the polarized light

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
from any regular

04:34.834 --> 04:37.333
two-dimensional movie,

converts it

using the holo-lens--

04:39.792 --> 04:44.250
Trademark pending-- and Voila.

04:39.792 --> 04:44.250
A holographic movie.

04:44.291 --> 04:47.458
You mean the monsters can

04:44.291 --> 04:47.458
stomp around in the audience?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.208
They'll look close enough

04:47.500 --> 04:50.208
to grab your popcorn.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.375
Sweet.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.375
Hey, Doc,

04:52.417 --> 04:54.125
if I can find another

04:52.417 --> 04:54.125
print of  Humungado,

04:54.166 --> 04:55.625
do you think

04:54.166 --> 04:55.625
we can screen it?

04:55.667 --> 04:58.959
Indubitably. And it will

04:55.667 --> 04:58.959
look more life-like

04:59.000 --> 05:01.458
than you could ever imagine.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.375
As soon as I get

05:03.583 --> 05:05.375
this reel threaded,

05:05.417 --> 05:07.208
we'll test Doc's

05:05.417 --> 05:07.208
new hologram lens

05:07.250 --> 05:09.333
for tomorrow's

05:07.250 --> 05:09.333
grand reopening.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.542
I knew we could count

05:09.375 --> 05:12.542
on our fellow Humungadorks.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.333
Tracked down this new print

05:12.583 --> 05:14.333
in no time.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.917
They threw in the sequels

05:14.375 --> 05:15.917
for nothing.

05:15.959 --> 05:18.125
Hm. Exactly

05:15.959 --> 05:18.125
what they're worth.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.458
Ready?

it was like it was right there

in front of you.

from a movie

be running loose

07:29.333 --> 07:31.083
in Griffin Rock?

07:31.125 --> 07:33.041
Is there any other place

07:31.125 --> 07:33.041
that could happen?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.500
It must have

07:33.083 --> 07:34.500
something to do with

Doc's holomorphic

07:34.542 --> 07:36.333
projector.

07:36.375 --> 07:39.166
Whatever its origins, we have

07:36.375 --> 07:39.166
to bring it down immediately.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.583
"Have to" is

07:39.208 --> 07:41.583
a strong phrase.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.417
Why don't we just

07:41.625 --> 07:43.417
let it fly away?

07:43.458 --> 07:46.041
Maybe to another island,

07:43.458 --> 07:46.041
where we aren't?

Don't worry,

07:46.083 --> 07:48.542
I got this, blue belly.

I told you,

it's sky blue.

any creepier.

We'll need to go after him.

of the tunnels

under the Mayor's house?

08:14.083 --> 08:16.208
into a deep dark tunnel.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.750

we have options.

to listen to the options.

In the movie, Rayvenous's eyes

08:29.583 --> 08:32.417
are his weak spot.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.834
Hit him with a beam of light.

08:32.458 --> 08:34.834
It temporarily knocks him out.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.375
BURNS:

08:34.875 --> 08:37.375
All right, Team.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.375
Let's split up.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.208
We'll each take a quadrant.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.250
( snarls )

08:51.291 --> 08:52.625
Uh...

08:52.667 --> 08:54.583
Good Rayvenous.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.834
( snarls )

08:55.875 --> 08:58.291
Good creepy thingy.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.750
( screeches )

08:59.792 --> 09:02.542
( grunts )

09:02.583 --> 09:05.208
Uh, guys? Found our monster.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.959
BLADES:

09:05.250 --> 09:06.959
And he's eating me!

09:07.000 --> 09:09.333
Aah! Help!

09:09.375 --> 09:11.125
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:13.667 --> 09:16.000
What was it you were saying

09:13.667 --> 09:16.000
before, Blades?

09:16.041 --> 09:19.458
About picking scary stuff

09:16.041 --> 09:19.458
off your windshield?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.500
( snarls )

09:23.250 --> 09:24.959
( screams )

09:25.000 --> 09:28.667
Why me every time? There are

09:25.000 --> 09:28.667
others in the room, you know.

09:28.709 --> 09:30.250
( screeches )

09:33.583 --> 09:35.000
Cody, call up Doc Greene

09:35.041 --> 09:36.875
and tell him to meet us

09:35.041 --> 09:36.875
at the drive-in.

09:36.917 --> 09:40.333
Let him know we've got a movie

09:36.917 --> 09:40.333
monster who's ready to go home.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.625
( screeches )

09:44.667 --> 09:47.125
GREENE:

09:44.667 --> 09:47.125
I believe

09:44.667 --> 09:47.125
a power fluctuation

09:47.166 --> 09:50.000
caused the lens' photonic

09:47.166 --> 09:50.000
component to overload.

09:50.041 --> 09:53.375
The surge of energy turned

09:50.041 --> 09:53.375
the hologram of Rayvenous

09:53.417 --> 09:54.917
into a solid creature,

09:54.959 --> 09:57.250
an embodiment

09:54.959 --> 09:57.250
of the movie monster,

09:57.291 --> 09:59.959
Complete with

09:57.291 --> 09:59.959
the original's instincts.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.917
Doc, how do we

10:00.000 --> 10:01.917
send it back?

10:01.959 --> 10:03.792
Daddy and I

10:01.959 --> 10:03.792
hooked up a dynama-pak

10:03.834 --> 10:06.458
to duplicate the conditions

10:03.834 --> 10:06.458
of the power surge.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.291
When the power reaches

10:06.500 --> 10:09.291
critical level,

10:09.333 --> 10:11.125
we'll reverse polarity.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.792
Which should return

10:12.792 --> 10:14.792
the solid creature

10:14.834 --> 10:16.583
to its holographic state,

10:16.625 --> 10:20.375
which we can then send back

10:16.625 --> 10:20.375
into any moment of the movie.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.709
Like so.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.667
Oh, dear.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.333
That wasn't in the plan.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.792
Find it! Quickly!

10:34.750 --> 10:37.083
Uh-oh.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.083
That music usually means...

Whoa!

10:52.667 --> 10:55.000
Watch out!

Take cover!

Fictional beast, you are

11:17.333 --> 11:21.250

I don't got him.

( Boulder grunts )

11:38.583 --> 11:41.583
All right, big fella.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.583
Time to settle down.

11:43.333 --> 11:44.750
Aah!

11:44.792 --> 11:46.125
( grunts )

11:47.875 --> 11:50.834
Meant to tell you, B.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.834
Watch out for his tail.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.083
Thanks.

11:52.125 --> 11:53.458
( Humungado roaring )

11:56.834 --> 11:59.959
We can't let him reach

11:56.834 --> 11:59.959
downtown.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:01.917 --> 12:04.166
Doc, we need to go

12:01.917 --> 12:04.166
after Humungado.

12:04.208 --> 12:05.792
Can you handle Rayvenous?

12:05.834 --> 12:07.750
Now that he's caged,

12:05.834 --> 12:07.750
he shouldn't be any trouble.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.166
Of course, Chief.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.333
And once

12:09.208 --> 12:11.333
I've fixed the projector,

12:11.375 --> 12:13.625
I'll send him straight back

12:11.375 --> 12:13.625
into his movie.

Blades, can you snag him

12:40.125 --> 12:41.709
with your winch?

I caught him!

Whoa! Humungado must really hate

13:18.667 --> 13:23.583
dinosaurs. Or billboards.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.166
Dinos.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.166
Everybody knows that.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.458
From the second sequel,

13:26.208 --> 13:28.458
where Humungado and Rayvenous

13:28.500 --> 13:30.333
team up to fight

13:28.500 --> 13:30.333
the Supersaurus.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.166
That's it.

13:30.375 --> 13:33.166
Kade, you're a genius.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.834
Yeah. But why now

13:33.208 --> 13:35.834
especially?

13:35.875 --> 13:37.583
Dad, if the Bots turn Dino,

13:37.625 --> 13:40.625
maybe Humungado will go

13:37.625 --> 13:40.625
after them and not the town.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.917
It's worth a try.

13:40.667 --> 13:43.917
No one on the streets, so...

the Dino Bots

are back in town.

than we are.

back onto celluloid

14:53.250 --> 14:56.041
where he belongs.

( muffled screech )

15:02.166 --> 15:04.667

15:04.709 --> 15:07.417
Just a little more power,

15:07.458 --> 15:09.583
and we'll be able

to reverse polarity.

Humungado must still want

15:33.083 --> 15:35.125
a piece of him.

15:35.166 --> 15:38.000
Then why not give old

15:35.166 --> 15:38.000
Fire Breath the opportunity?

15:38.041 --> 15:40.000
Use Rayvenous as bait.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.417
A sound strategy.

15:41.458 --> 15:44.041
Lead Humungado straight

15:41.458 --> 15:44.041
to the outdoor cinema...

15:44.083 --> 15:45.959
And send him back

Try blockbuster.

something to fight about.

No, the lights.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.333
We're going down.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:12.166 --> 18:14.125
( Blades transforms )

18:16.000 --> 18:17.583
Blades! Dani!

18:16.000 --> 18:17.583
Talk to me!

18:17.625 --> 18:19.750
Are you okay?

18:17.625 --> 18:19.750
I'm fine, I'm fine.

18:19.792 --> 18:22.458
He barely missed

18:19.792 --> 18:22.458
my swashplate.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.959
( Rayvenous screeching )

18:25.000 --> 18:27.458
BLADES:

18:25.000 --> 18:27.458
Rayvenous is loose again.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.834
That's good. They'll keep

18:27.500 --> 18:29.834
each other busy fighting.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.250
Doc, roll 'em to the rescue.

18:32.291 --> 18:34.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:36.166 --> 18:38.208
GREENE:

18:36.166 --> 18:38.208
Just another few minutes.

18:38.250 --> 18:41.041
( roars )

18:41.083 --> 18:44.458
Um, I thought you said

18:41.083 --> 18:44.458
they'd fight each other.

18:44.500 --> 18:48.917
He also said they teamed up

18:44.500 --> 18:48.917
to fight the Supersaurus.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.875
And the Rhinoctopus.

18:50.917 --> 18:53.083
GRAHAM:

18:50.917 --> 18:53.083
And now, apparently, us.

18:53.125 --> 18:55.291
So before when Humungado

18:53.125 --> 18:55.291
was attacking the box

18:55.333 --> 18:57.625
Rayvenous was in,

18:55.333 --> 18:57.625
he was trying to free him?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.750
These guys are...friends?

18:59.792 --> 19:03.917
No way. That just--

18:59.792 --> 19:03.917
Makes a lot of sense, actually.

19:03.959 --> 19:05.917
CHASE:

19:03.959 --> 19:05.917
And we are their common enemy.

19:05.959 --> 19:07.458
( both roaring )

19:07.500 --> 19:09.709
Chief, you have

19:07.500 --> 19:09.709
to keep them contained

19:09.750 --> 19:12.291
within

19:09.750 --> 19:12.291
the holographic field.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:14.458 --> 19:16.542
( screeches )

19:16.583 --> 19:20.208
Okay, spike gut,

19:16.583 --> 19:20.208
enough is enough.

19:20.250 --> 19:23.959
I've had it with you.

19:20.250 --> 19:23.959
Aah!

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
( Rayvenous screeching )

19:27.375 --> 19:29.375
( grunting )

19:30.583 --> 19:32.709
( Humungado roaring )

19:36.041 --> 19:37.792
( grunts )

19:37.834 --> 19:40.458
Don't have anything

19:37.834 --> 19:40.458
nice to say,

19:40.500 --> 19:42.917
don't say anything.

19:47.834 --> 19:51.000
( Bots grunting )

19:52.667 --> 19:53.875
Ready, daddy.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.125
We only have

19:53.917 --> 19:56.125
one shot at this.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.500
We need both creatures

19:56.166 --> 19:58.500
inside the field.

19:58.542 --> 20:00.083
Where's Blades?

20:00.125 --> 20:02.500
BLADES:

20:00.125 --> 20:02.500
Whoo-hoo! Hyah!

20:02.542 --> 20:04.166
Yee-haw!

20:04.208 --> 20:06.125
( Rayvenous screeching )

20:06.166 --> 20:07.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:17.792 --> 20:19.667
( hands clap )

20:19.709 --> 20:23.583
Now, that's what the sequel

20:19.709 --> 20:23.583
should've looked like. Ha!

20:23.625 --> 20:26.834
Ah, I think maybe you'd better

20:23.625 --> 20:26.834
retire that lens, Doc.

20:26.875 --> 20:30.333
Or only use it

20:26.875 --> 20:30.333
on cute little animal movies.

20:30.375 --> 20:32.792
Humungado and Rayvenous,

20:30.375 --> 20:32.792
friends.

20:32.834 --> 20:34.500
This adds a whole new layer

20:32.834 --> 20:34.500
of meaning.

20:34.542 --> 20:36.667
I'll have to rewatch

20:34.542 --> 20:36.667
the entire series.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.542
But the two creatures

20:36.709 --> 20:39.542
fight as well.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.166
How can they be

20:39.583 --> 20:41.166
friends?

20:41.208 --> 20:43.291
Just like a few humans

20:41.208 --> 20:43.291
I know.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.333
Not mentioning any names.

20:43.333 --> 20:46.333
Dani and Kade.

20:46.375 --> 20:49.000
Us? How about you

20:46.375 --> 20:49.000
and Heatwave?

20:49.041 --> 20:50.959
Oh, Heatwave and I don't--

20:49.041 --> 20:50.959
We don't--

20:51.000 --> 20:52.875
Actually,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.875
I guess we do.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.750
Yeah, you're right.

20:54.792 --> 20:56.917
Okay, tomorrow night,

20:56.959 --> 21:00.166
we screen  Humungado

20:56.959 --> 21:00.166
and all the sequels,

21:00.208 --> 21:02.625
this time without

21:00.208 --> 21:02.625
Doc's special lens.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.083
Who's up for it?

21:06.041 --> 21:08.083
I guess I'll call Bunty.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.709
(  dramatic music playing  )

21:09.750 --> 21:13.500
Thanks, guys. It means a lot

21:09.750 --> 21:13.500
more with all of you here.

21:13.542 --> 21:16.583
That's what family does.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.208
We can still complain too,

21:16.625 --> 21:18.208
right?

21:18.250 --> 21:20.458
'Cause it hasn't gotten

21:18.250 --> 21:20.458
any warmer.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.750
BLADES:

21:20.500 --> 21:22.750
And where are

21:20.500 --> 21:22.750
the cute little animals?

21:22.792 --> 21:24.458
Heatwave,

21:22.792 --> 21:24.458
you told me--

21:24.500 --> 21:26.291
( Heatwave chuckles )

21:26.333 --> 21:28.333
(  roaring  )

21:30.667 --> 21:32.792
