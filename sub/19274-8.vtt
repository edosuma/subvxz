00:17.039 --> 00:18.953
Previously on APB...

00:18.978 --> 00:21.538
The Reeves TK421.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.137
If you have an oil fire, it can do this.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.711
Give me the 13th district to run.

00:28.758 --> 00:29.891
I will upgrade the 13th

00:29.926 --> 00:31.740
to the best technology money can buy.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.875
I'm here to make it possible with this.

00:33.930 --> 00:36.244
It allows citizens to call in

00:36.269 --> 00:38.136
GPS located crime reports.

00:38.161 --> 00:40.100
You know those people you're
trying to serve and protect?

00:40.163 --> 00:41.729
They just became your partners.

00:41.765 --> 00:44.632
You are bleeding money with
this new little cop hobby.

00:44.668 --> 00:46.000
We are here to drum up new business

00:46.036 --> 00:47.967
- and increase revenue, period.
- Please.

00:47.992 --> 00:50.051
Remember the strategic
partnership with MilliScan?

00:50.076 --> 00:52.537
Those boring gray boxes find guns.

00:52.562 --> 00:54.842
We could own privatized policing.

00:54.878 --> 00:57.951
I mean, this is not some
small Chicago experiment.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.013
I mean, this could go global.

00:59.049 --> 01:01.459
This could be a billion dollar business.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.454
Every 15 seconds,

01:06.489 --> 01:09.157
an American home is broken into.

01:09.192 --> 01:11.626
But with the innovations
of Reeves Security,

01:11.651 --> 01:14.904
you don't need to live
or work in fear anymore.

01:14.939 --> 01:17.384
For both residential
and corporate clients,

01:17.409 --> 01:19.368
Reeves Security is always there,

01:19.393 --> 01:21.812
keeping you safe no matter where you go.

01:21.837 --> 01:23.604
And now, for the first time ever,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.562
Reeves Security is allowing subscribers

01:25.587 --> 01:27.998
to select their own
levels of protection,

01:28.023 --> 01:29.310
working directly with police

01:29.346 --> 01:31.479
to customize patrols in your area.

01:31.514 --> 01:32.725
Whether you need them

01:32.750 --> 01:35.250
or you just need peace of mind.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.694
So, what do you think?

01:40.657 --> 01:42.757
Do they all have to smile so much?

01:42.792 --> 01:44.025
Oh, Gideon,

01:44.060 --> 01:45.843
this is everything that we talked about.

01:45.868 --> 01:48.029
No, no, no, it's everything
that you talked about.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.131
Ah, the subscribers

01:50.166 --> 01:51.899
and levels of protection?

01:51.935 --> 01:54.288
You can't make people
pay to call the police.

01:54.313 --> 01:56.304
All right, can we just skip this part?

01:56.339 --> 01:57.572
We don't have time for it.

01:57.607 --> 01:59.807
You have your annual
shareholders meeting in two days.

01:59.843 --> 02:01.142
So? I know the drill.

02:01.177 --> 02:03.111
I go in and I give one
of my classic speeches,

02:03.146 --> 02:05.146
shake a few hands, see
everybody next year.

02:05.181 --> 02:07.148
No, no, this is not of your TED Talks,

02:07.183 --> 02:09.150
where you can just "Gideon"
your way through it.

02:09.185 --> 02:11.185
You have to release your
quarterly statements.

02:11.221 --> 02:14.675
So, you can either show
a $400 million write-down,

02:14.700 --> 02:17.268
or a billion dollar...

02:17.293 --> 02:18.760
new business.

02:22.992 --> 02:24.545
It's just...

02:24.734 --> 02:26.467
when I started all this, I thought

02:26.503 --> 02:28.436
I was making the world a
better place for everybody,

02:28.471 --> 02:32.357
not just rich people like me.

02:32.662 --> 02:35.042
Well, I knew you when
you were just a scared,

02:35.078 --> 02:36.878
scrawny little freshman at MIT.

02:36.913 --> 02:38.279
Everyone knew that you were smart,

02:38.304 --> 02:42.130
but I knew that there was
more to you than just that.

02:42.215 --> 02:43.848
Gideon, this...

02:43.873 --> 02:45.386
this is the fix to our problem.

02:45.422 --> 02:46.654
One second.

02:46.679 --> 02:48.234
_

02:48.259 --> 02:50.358
They need me at a crime
scene. It sounds urgent.

02:50.393 --> 02:52.367
Yeah, sounds familiar.

02:52.392 --> 02:54.228
Will you promise me that
you will think about it?

02:54.264 --> 02:55.396
If you promise to wear that...

02:55.432 --> 02:57.398
that thing with the
leather and the straps.

02:57.434 --> 02:58.666
Yeah, make it happen,

02:58.701 --> 03:00.972
and you can have anything you want.

03:09.464 --> 03:11.179
Thank you for coming down, Mr. Reeves.

03:11.205 --> 03:12.951
Hate to bother you, I know you
had a big meeting today, but...

03:12.985 --> 03:14.031
No, no, no.

03:14.056 --> 03:16.161
... we got a real nasty situation here.

03:16.186 --> 03:18.419
I need you to get on
the horn with the mayor,

03:18.455 --> 03:20.988
see if you can get him to shut
down the streets of the 13th.

03:21.024 --> 03:23.578
Oh, time for a block party or...

03:23.603 --> 03:25.927
I wish. We need to impose curfew.

03:26.259 --> 03:28.763
Well, not that I don't
enjoy talking to the mayor,

03:28.805 --> 03:31.506
but wha... why am I talking
to the mayor, exactly?

03:31.534 --> 03:33.601
Aren't fires the fire
department's problem?

03:33.636 --> 03:36.504
It's not about the fire.
It's about the gang war.

03:36.539 --> 03:38.206
See that guy in the red flannel?

03:38.241 --> 03:39.507
That's Andre Coates,

03:39.542 --> 03:40.908
leader of the Green Street Kings,

03:40.944 --> 03:43.678
one of the two biggest
gangs in the 13th district.

03:43.713 --> 03:46.080
- Who's the other?
- 38th Street Hustlas.

03:46.115 --> 03:48.855
They had a building torched
in their hood two weeks ago.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.117
Couple of 'em still in the hospital.

03:50.153 --> 03:52.348
So, this is retaliation.

03:52.373 --> 03:54.856
That body in the bag,
that's one of Andre's boys.

03:54.891 --> 03:56.657
So, yeah, I'd say that's a safe bet.

03:56.693 --> 03:58.418
There's nothing safe
about this situation.

03:58.443 --> 03:59.594
We need to get out in front of it

03:59.629 --> 04:01.529
before someone else is hurt or killed.

04:01.555 --> 04:04.389
Okay, but I... shutting
down the district?

04:04.434 --> 04:05.766
I don't like it, either,

04:05.802 --> 04:07.935
but we can't round up
every banger in a day.

04:07.971 --> 04:09.437
And as hot as this situation's getting,

04:09.472 --> 04:11.072
one day might be all we have.

04:11.107 --> 04:13.407
These boys are out for
blood. We need answers.

04:14.226 --> 04:16.410
All right, let's get some.

04:16.446 --> 04:18.857
- Gideon, we can't go in there.
- To look.

04:19.632 --> 04:22.445
- Gideon...
- Just give me one second.

04:24.087 --> 04:26.496
- Oh, yeah.
- This is an active scene.

04:26.521 --> 04:29.890
We can't be here unless
fire gives us the all-clear.

04:31.661 --> 04:33.561
Relax. Got what I need.

04:37.590 --> 04:39.906

www.addic7ed.com

04:40.093 --> 04:41.402
What's this?

04:41.437 --> 04:43.709
It performs a chemical analysis,

04:43.734 --> 04:46.101
telling us what was
used to start the fire.

04:46.126 --> 04:48.637
Well, it's acetone and petrolatum.

04:49.470 --> 04:52.851
Basically nail polish
remover and petroleum jelly.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.031
That's great.

04:54.056 --> 04:56.719
Can we get the molarity of
the acetone before ignition?

04:56.744 --> 04:57.943
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:57.968 --> 04:59.312
Gideon, we're supposed to figure out

04:59.337 --> 05:01.185
how to stop the fires, not start them.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.495
That's exactly what we're doing.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.061
- By doing a science project?
- Yes.

05:04.086 --> 05:07.531
When the going gets tough,
the smart work backwards.

05:07.556 --> 05:09.623
If we can identify the accelerant,

05:09.650 --> 05:12.507
we could use our cars to sniff it out.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.795
- Sniff it out?
- Well, each of the D13 Caddies

05:15.820 --> 05:18.273
is equipped with a chemical
olfactory trace technology.

05:18.298 --> 05:20.867
So, it can actually
detect minute measurements

05:20.903 --> 05:23.103
of TATP and TPH in the air.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.828
Bomb stuff, they smell bomb stuff.

05:24.852 --> 05:26.990
We're gonna me 'em smell fire stuff.

05:27.015 --> 05:29.021
Can it sniff out a good
Cuban restaurant, too?

05:29.056 --> 05:30.572
I'm gonna work on that.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.926
Then he hit me here,
then he kicked me there,

05:34.954 --> 05:36.384
and then he held me
down and hit me again,

05:36.417 --> 05:38.196
here, here and here.

05:38.231 --> 05:39.698
And this was before or after

05:39.733 --> 05:41.353
your altercation on the dance floor?

05:41.378 --> 05:43.134
After, but I told you,
that was a misunderstanding.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.547
- The bastard you should be arresting...
- The bouncer.

05:45.572 --> 05:48.502
Yeah, you said that already.

05:49.001 --> 05:50.329
I think we get the picture.

05:50.394 --> 05:52.336
We'll look into it and
let you know what we find.

05:52.361 --> 05:53.478
That's it?

05:53.513 --> 05:55.246
You'll look into it?

05:55.282 --> 05:56.948
I was assaulted and
I've been sitting here

05:56.984 --> 05:58.216
all morning, telling the same story.

05:58.251 --> 05:59.718
Hey, I understand that you're upset.

05:59.753 --> 06:01.586
But see everybody running around here?

06:01.622 --> 06:04.255
There was a quadruple homicide
last night and right now...

06:04.291 --> 06:06.159
I'd like a copy of that report.

06:06.184 --> 06:08.614
We'll send it to you when
we finish writing it up.

06:08.639 --> 06:12.374
Yeah. Officer DeVoll
here will show you out.

06:13.816 --> 06:15.221
We'll be in touch.

06:15.246 --> 06:16.968
Follow me, please, sir.

06:22.267 --> 06:23.533
Hey.

06:23.558 --> 06:24.891
What you doing?

06:25.546 --> 06:27.754
Saving us time.

06:27.785 --> 06:29.676
That crap about the report?

06:29.701 --> 06:31.449
Kid's just looking for a lawsuit.

06:31.485 --> 06:33.318
What, you think he did
that to his own face?

06:33.353 --> 06:34.785
No.

06:35.555 --> 06:38.189
I think the guy he was
talking crap to did it,

06:38.225 --> 06:40.258
but he was too drunk to I.D. anyone,

06:40.293 --> 06:41.826
so he's going after the bar.

06:41.862 --> 06:43.561
Yeah, but he said the
bouncer attacked him.

06:43.597 --> 06:45.664
Yeah, and see, that's my other problem.

06:45.699 --> 06:48.159
I know the bouncer,
he's a friend of mine.

06:48.184 --> 06:50.268
Guy named Vic Evans, we served together.

06:50.303 --> 06:51.803
And I'm not buying
that Vic couldn't handle

06:51.838 --> 06:54.190
some entitled rich kid with a big mouth.

06:54.215 --> 06:57.364
Yeah, well, you can't
just throw out the report.

06:57.389 --> 07:00.395
Might be nothing, but we
still got to check it out.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.058
I'm sorry, I know
you're a genius and all,

07:13.093 --> 07:14.359
but I don't like this.

07:14.394 --> 07:15.927
What are you talking about?

07:15.962 --> 07:17.996
I got half the guys in the
department driving around

07:18.031 --> 07:19.597
looking for fires and all we've found

07:19.633 --> 07:20.865
is some guys stripping paint.

07:20.901 --> 07:22.300
Yeah, technically, that means it's...

07:22.335 --> 07:23.568
it's working.

07:23.603 --> 07:26.882
Yeah, but I can lower the
detection threshold a little bit.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.318
I don't know anything
about detection threshold,

07:30.343 --> 07:31.676
but we're running out of time.

07:31.712 --> 07:33.111
I feel like we're one fire away

07:33.146 --> 07:35.080
from the whole district
going up in flames.

07:35.115 --> 07:37.682
It's a balance, okay? We
just need to calibrate it

07:37.718 --> 07:40.652
until we come up with the exact
right combination of smells.

07:40.687 --> 07:42.320
But an active gang war is not the time

07:42.355 --> 07:43.788
to be working out the kinks.

07:43.824 --> 07:46.091
I know, just give it a chance.

07:46.126 --> 07:48.026
I promise you're gonna love this.

07:49.317 --> 07:50.583
Ah, we got a hit.

07:50.608 --> 07:53.732
Cobb and Reyes, on a residential
street, outside Canaryville.

07:55.607 --> 07:57.365
All right, let's go.

07:58.638 --> 08:01.239
Squad, we got any idea which
address it's coming from?

08:01.274 --> 08:03.108
Not unless you can drive your Caddy

08:03.143 --> 08:04.275
into all those houses.

08:04.311 --> 08:05.977
That's actually something
I should be working on.

08:06.012 --> 08:07.615
Looks like we're knocking.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.417
CPD!

08:12.452 --> 08:13.985
Can I help you?

08:14.020 --> 08:16.385
Sorry, wrong address.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.627
CPD, open up.

08:19.652 --> 08:20.901
Yeah?

08:21.286 --> 08:23.018
Never mind. Sorry to bother you.

08:28.390 --> 08:29.862
You smell that?

08:30.882 --> 08:32.313
CPD!

08:38.708 --> 08:40.346
CPD, open up!

08:46.433 --> 08:48.233
- Squad, unless our firebug
- Manicure...

08:48.258 --> 08:50.307
is also giving mani-pedis
without a permit,

08:50.332 --> 08:52.065
I'd say this one is a miss, too.

08:52.090 --> 08:54.549
All right, Murphy,
that's it, I'm calling it.

08:54.574 --> 08:56.240
It's time to start
combing through the SSL,

08:56.265 --> 08:57.264
see who comes up.

08:57.289 --> 08:58.448
Copy, Squad.

08:58.473 --> 08:59.745
Sorry, Gideon.

09:05.159 --> 09:06.512
Captain, Captain!

09:06.559 --> 09:07.792
One more, one more, one more.

09:07.827 --> 09:10.294
Murph, we got one more.
You getting that reading?

09:12.871 --> 09:14.665
It's pretty weak.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.934
Well, check out the
building on the corner.

09:16.969 --> 09:20.527
The chemical signature is a
little bit different this time.

09:20.573 --> 09:22.434
Is that supposed to mean something?

09:22.459 --> 09:24.870
Uh, yeah, it might.

09:24.895 --> 09:27.054
You want me to explain the science
or can I just let her check it out?

09:27.079 --> 09:28.279
Last one.

09:28.314 --> 09:29.995
Murphy, it's coming from somewhere

09:30.020 --> 09:32.100
in the south side of the street.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.918
Okay, I'll take a look.

09:42.121 --> 09:43.320
Hey, check this out.

09:43.396 --> 09:46.000
That's the Green Street Kings tag.

09:48.334 --> 09:49.667
Make sure, Murphy.

09:49.692 --> 09:51.766
I'm sick of false alarms.

09:51.791 --> 09:53.234
Captain?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.292
This is not a false alarm.

10:02.626 --> 10:04.157
Fire! Everybody out, come on!

10:04.182 --> 10:05.288
Everybody out!

10:05.313 --> 10:06.438
Gideon, I need backup.

10:06.463 --> 10:07.704
Fire, police, everything.

10:07.729 --> 10:09.329
All right, who can you get over there?

10:09.354 --> 10:11.088
Cobb and Reyes, but
they're not that close.

10:11.113 --> 10:13.204
Fire department's on the
way, three minutes out.

10:13.229 --> 10:15.938
_

10:15.978 --> 10:17.110
_

10:17.135 --> 10:20.001
_

10:22.633 --> 10:23.930
Señora...

10:23.955 --> 10:25.989
Okay?

10:26.014 --> 10:27.212
Grab me that towel.

10:27.237 --> 10:28.570
Okay?

10:29.016 --> 10:30.555
It's okay, come on, follow me.

10:31.727 --> 10:33.293
What the hell?

10:35.377 --> 10:37.305
Hey, Murphy, head left.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.596
We got your back.

10:38.621 --> 10:40.855
Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go.

10:43.340 --> 10:45.441
Gideon, I can't see.
The smoke is too thick.

10:45.466 --> 10:48.038
Uh, can you... can you put a
digital filter on the body-cam?

10:48.063 --> 10:49.096
Yeah, I can throw out
the visual spectrum

10:49.131 --> 10:51.297
and I can turn on the IR.

10:52.438 --> 10:54.749
Hug the right, there's a hot spot

10:54.774 --> 10:56.470
- on the left side of the hall.
- Okay.

10:58.307 --> 10:59.573
Come on, stay against the wall, okay?

10:59.608 --> 11:00.741
Good, good, good.

11:00.776 --> 11:01.821
Stay close.

11:01.846 --> 11:03.031
You got it.

11:05.036 --> 11:06.646
Move, move, move, move!

11:06.682 --> 11:07.973
Move!

11:08.350 --> 11:09.816
All right, I see a clearing. Come on.

11:09.852 --> 11:11.284
Follow me, okay?

11:11.320 --> 11:12.981
Good, you got it. You got it.

11:13.022 --> 11:14.270
Yes.

11:15.422 --> 11:16.645
Mima!

11:19.980 --> 11:21.312
You got her?

11:21.337 --> 11:23.340
Good? All right.

11:23.365 --> 11:25.317
Gracias, Adriana.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.751
Hey.

11:46.731 --> 11:48.462
Do you have anywhere to stay?

11:48.487 --> 11:50.326
Do you have family around here?

11:50.365 --> 11:53.026
No, they're all back in Honduras.

11:53.062 --> 11:54.728
I'll figure something out.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.473
Why don't you stay with me?

11:56.498 --> 11:58.198
No, I'll be fine. I'm just...

11:58.233 --> 12:00.224
Argue with a police officer?

12:00.271 --> 12:01.802
I got a guest room you can use

12:01.837 --> 12:03.870
until you get back on your feet.

12:05.374 --> 12:06.506
Come on.

12:14.268 --> 12:16.149
- Vic.
- Brando.

12:16.185 --> 12:18.351
What's your ugly mug doing
in here before 6:00, huh?

12:19.621 --> 12:21.555
Hey, let's get this guy a
beer, he's a buddy of mine.

12:21.590 --> 12:23.623
- As much as I'd love to...
- Okay.

12:23.659 --> 12:24.991
Yeah. There's a little something

12:25.027 --> 12:27.027
we got to clear up about last night.

12:27.062 --> 12:28.161
That happened here?

12:28.197 --> 12:29.529
Yeah. You got a sec?

12:29.565 --> 12:31.609
Of course. I mean, not much to tell.

12:31.634 --> 12:33.300
It was just a regular day at the office.

12:33.335 --> 12:35.335
Yeah, some college kid,
he came in this morning

12:35.370 --> 12:37.070
with a busted-up face,
said he got attacked

12:37.106 --> 12:38.444
on his way out of here.

12:38.469 --> 12:40.373
- By who?
- By you.

12:40.409 --> 12:42.342
It's probably nothing, but, uh, the kid,

12:42.377 --> 12:45.278
he's talking a big game, like
he wants to sue or something.

12:45.314 --> 12:47.364
We just need to hear
your side of the story.

12:47.389 --> 12:49.202
You remember what happened?

12:49.393 --> 12:50.626
Yeah, of course I do.

12:50.651 --> 12:52.452
He's a frat boy, right?

12:52.488 --> 12:53.920
Yeah.

12:53.956 --> 12:55.155
He got rowdy on the dance floor.

12:55.190 --> 12:56.690
He had tequila coming out of his ears.

12:56.725 --> 12:58.091
He stepped on some girl's toe,

12:58.127 --> 12:59.663
got into it with her boyfriend.

12:59.725 --> 13:01.261
So I had to show him the door.

13:01.296 --> 13:02.863
I didn't attack anybody.

13:02.898 --> 13:04.428
So you threw him out?

13:04.530 --> 13:06.500
Yeah. You know, I end up tossing, like,

13:06.535 --> 13:08.153
three or four drunks a night.

13:08.178 --> 13:11.171
But this... this guy can't
actually sue me, right?

13:11.206 --> 13:12.538
Well, not if I got a say in it.

13:12.563 --> 13:14.288
Do you have cameras in this place?

13:14.313 --> 13:16.366
- Anything out front, maybe?
- Yeah.

13:16.391 --> 13:18.478
But troublemakers don't
go out the front door.

13:18.514 --> 13:20.497
The owner doesn't want
'em scaring away customers.

13:20.522 --> 13:21.788
What about cameras out back?

13:21.867 --> 13:23.866
They don't have any
cameras by the rear exit.

13:24.019 --> 13:25.388
Mind if we take a look?

13:25.413 --> 13:27.087
Sure thing. The gate's unlocked.

13:27.122 --> 13:28.955
Look, I got a few more cases to stock.

13:28.991 --> 13:31.325
Do your thing, Vic, we're all good.

13:31.350 --> 13:35.228
Oh, we got some sick new
flat-screens in the VIP room.

13:35.264 --> 13:36.963
I'm not working tonight... you
want to watch the Bulls game?

13:36.999 --> 13:38.398
Uh...

13:39.168 --> 13:40.811
yeah, sounds fun.

13:44.778 --> 13:46.680
Sounds fun?

13:46.867 --> 13:49.009
What, you don't like free beer?

13:50.766 --> 13:52.979
Would you just, like,
relax a little bit, please?

13:53.015 --> 13:54.915
There's nothing to investigate here.

13:54.950 --> 13:56.716
It's just some rich drunk
kid's word against Vic's,

13:56.752 --> 13:58.818
and I've known him for years.

13:58.854 --> 14:00.520
And the guy got me through boot camp.

14:00.556 --> 14:01.688
If it wasn't for him, I'd still be

14:01.723 --> 14:03.447
face down in a ditch.

14:03.472 --> 14:04.976
Now let's go.

14:11.177 --> 14:13.029
Okay, here you go.

14:13.054 --> 14:14.982
This one's really soft.
You should take this one.

14:15.007 --> 14:17.390
- I'm sorry, I can't take it.
- No, please, I want you to.

14:17.415 --> 14:18.872
Go on, try it on.

14:19.228 --> 14:20.711
You know what, I used to always

14:20.736 --> 14:23.343
dress my little brother
up in my old clothes.

14:23.512 --> 14:25.155
I always wanted a little sister.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.080
- I have a little sister.
- Yeah?

14:27.115 --> 14:28.882
Yeah, back in Honduras.

14:28.917 --> 14:30.411
I should have stayed there.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.618
Why didn't you?

14:31.653 --> 14:34.955
My mom got sick, so I
came here to find work.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.194
And for five months I sent money home.

14:39.624 --> 14:42.729
When she died, I didn't even
get to go to her funeral.

14:43.436 --> 14:45.216
I was trying to make it here alone.

14:45.241 --> 14:47.444
But then the fire took everything.

14:47.836 --> 14:49.502
It just happened so fast.

14:49.538 --> 14:51.757
Yeah, those old buildings,
they burn pretty quick.

14:51.782 --> 14:53.949
But I've never seen
a fire move like that.

15:12.261 --> 15:14.380
Hey, uh...

15:14.755 --> 15:16.655
can I ask you something?

15:16.783 --> 15:18.333
Yeah.

15:19.268 --> 15:20.934
Do you ever feel unsafe?

15:20.969 --> 15:22.068
Like from you or...

15:22.104 --> 15:24.137
That's funny. No, I
mean in your daily life,

15:24.172 --> 15:27.173
do you ever... find yourself wishing

15:27.209 --> 15:29.776
that you had more protection?

15:29.811 --> 15:32.312
Now I do. What's this about?

15:32.347 --> 15:34.514
Well, Lauren has an idea for how we can

15:34.549 --> 15:36.396
save the future of Reeves.

15:36.421 --> 15:39.052
Ah. By asking vague questions?

15:39.087 --> 15:41.087
By selling our police tech to civilians.

15:42.424 --> 15:44.124
Private security, right?

15:44.159 --> 15:45.392
There's a lot of money there.

15:45.427 --> 15:48.282
Pricey condos and gated communities.

15:48.329 --> 15:50.764
Yeah, that sounds awesome.
It sounds like, uh,

15:50.799 --> 15:52.329
like Disneyland.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.906
Or, you know, North Korea.

15:53.931 --> 15:56.770
Can't exactly fund every
district in the country.

15:56.805 --> 15:58.548
Even billionaires don't
have that kind of money.

15:58.573 --> 16:00.040
Oh, my God.

16:00.075 --> 16:02.142
You sound just like Lauren.

16:02.177 --> 16:04.778
Man, it is crazy how quickly
she gets in your head.

16:04.813 --> 16:06.579
But by all means, you guys
want to turn this world

16:06.615 --> 16:08.181
into a police state,
that's fine with me.

16:08.216 --> 16:09.843
Just don't ask for my help.

16:11.653 --> 16:13.672
What does she think about all this?

16:16.881 --> 16:18.338
Hasn't really come up.

16:19.394 --> 16:21.628
- Huh.
- What?

16:21.663 --> 16:23.229
Well, if you can't
talk to Murphy about it,

16:23.265 --> 16:24.898
it's probably a really dumb idea.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.226
We need to talk.

16:26.251 --> 16:28.266
Sounds serious.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.423
I've got a hunch.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.271
Oh, how Scooby-Doo of you. What is it?

16:31.306 --> 16:34.040
I can't explain it, but I
can't shake this-this feeling

16:34.065 --> 16:35.531
that this isn't a real gang war.

16:35.556 --> 16:37.907
I mean, if the Hustlas and Kings
really wanted to kill each other,

16:37.932 --> 16:39.979
all it would take would
be, like, some drive-bys.

16:40.015 --> 16:42.082
Both of those gangs
are armed to the teeth.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.184
Why burn down a building
full of immigrant families?

16:44.209 --> 16:46.906
I just combed through the
records, and before last month,

16:46.931 --> 16:49.668
there's never been any history
of arson with either one of them.

16:50.268 --> 16:52.635
Maybe they decided to turn up the heat.

16:53.245 --> 16:54.792
See what I did there?

16:54.817 --> 16:57.301
There's only one way
to find out for sure.

16:57.326 --> 16:59.801
- What's that?
- It's time to have dinner with Andre.

17:12.375 --> 17:15.041
There's always some kind of
beef between us and the Hustlas,

17:15.585 --> 17:18.569
but killing grandmas,
that ain't how we get down.

17:18.924 --> 17:21.515
We want new turf, we need
customers, not corpses.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.173
Right.

17:23.419 --> 17:25.486
Don't you think the
Hustlas feel the same?

17:25.521 --> 17:27.221
I don't give a damn how they feel.

17:28.137 --> 17:31.398
You still think they set the
fire that killed your boy?

17:33.716 --> 17:35.216
- Probably not.
- Good.

17:35.241 --> 17:36.430
So you're not gonna hit back?

17:36.466 --> 17:37.856
I didn't say all that.

17:37.881 --> 17:39.300
I still got to do what I got to do.

17:39.335 --> 17:40.661
You just said that they didn't do it.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.183
I know what I said.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.786
I'm a CEO, just like you.

17:45.228 --> 17:47.929
End of the day, I got a bottom line.

17:48.231 --> 17:49.944
Situation like this creates

17:49.979 --> 17:52.208
what you might call a
leadership challenge.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.895
I can't let my people see me
taking, and not giving it back.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.888
Andre, please, just hold off a day.

17:58.113 --> 17:59.279
Okay?

17:59.304 --> 18:00.688
Give us a chance.

18:00.723 --> 18:02.341
What the hell you gonna do with a day?

18:02.366 --> 18:03.891
Get the guy who really did this,

18:03.926 --> 18:05.760
and put his ass in jail.

18:08.803 --> 18:10.236
Fine.

18:11.427 --> 18:13.583
I'll tell my boys to chill,

18:13.970 --> 18:17.388
but you and Richie Rich
over here... better hurry.

18:17.658 --> 18:20.122
By the way, dinner's on you.

18:29.252 --> 18:30.985
If this wasn't the
Hustlas and the Kings,

18:31.020 --> 18:32.119
we're back at square one.

18:32.155 --> 18:34.789
Or... and I'm just
throwing this out there...

18:34.824 --> 18:38.149
maybe the career
criminal was lying to us.

18:38.427 --> 18:40.661
Andre knows he's better
off telling me the truth.

18:40.696 --> 18:42.830
If he says he didn't
do it, he didn't do it.

18:42.865 --> 18:44.265
But he's not gonna
keep the peace for long

18:44.300 --> 18:46.258
unless we can figure out who did.

18:46.283 --> 18:47.735
Anything else on the fire report?

18:47.770 --> 18:50.204
No, no. I read it. It's pretty useless.

18:50.239 --> 18:53.140
They had to come up with new
ways to say "catastrophic."

18:53.176 --> 18:54.475
Damn it.

18:54.510 --> 18:56.985
How did those fires spread so quick?

18:57.146 --> 18:59.446
I wish I could just go back in time

18:59.482 --> 19:01.549
and pay more attention
when I was in there.

19:03.326 --> 19:05.837
Go back in time to when you were there.

19:05.862 --> 19:07.261
Murphy...

19:07.824 --> 19:10.000
you're a genius.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.600
I'm-I'm... I'm the genius,

19:12.628 --> 19:15.330
but you're very smart.

19:15.965 --> 19:17.798
Let's get back to the station.

19:17.834 --> 19:19.233
I got an idea.

19:19.268 --> 19:22.058
So I was able to use the
footage from Murphy's body-cam,

19:22.104 --> 19:24.238
along with some that
Ada pulled off her phone

19:24.273 --> 19:26.547
to reconstruct the
fire in this 360-degree

19:26.572 --> 19:29.443
- virtual view of what happened.
- Hell yes!

19:29.478 --> 19:32.213
It's great. So the full-size one,

19:32.248 --> 19:33.946
it'll have the same resolution?

19:33.971 --> 19:36.150
Full-size? What, you want it bigger?

19:36.185 --> 19:38.940
Oh, yeah, I got to be able to
walk around in it with Murphy.

19:38.965 --> 19:40.455
I'm thinking, like, ten or 12 feet.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.655
How big is this room?

19:41.691 --> 19:43.724
Gideon, that's not gonna be cheap.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.600
No. Good thing you're not paying.

19:45.628 --> 19:46.827
When can you have it done?

19:46.863 --> 19:48.863
Uh, four hours, I guess.

19:48.898 --> 19:50.531
Cool, I'll be down there in two.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.635
Good work.

19:53.703 --> 19:54.935
Oh, come... come on!

19:54.971 --> 19:56.526
What are you calling a foul?

19:56.551 --> 19:58.315
Just let these guys play.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.627
Ah, we never should
have got rid of Noah.

20:00.910 --> 20:02.977
Man, I still haven't gotten over Jordan.

20:04.403 --> 20:07.481
Yeah. Well, you got to
love the Bulls, you know...

20:07.516 --> 20:09.674
Hey, uh, I've been meaning to ask you.

20:09.699 --> 20:11.986
What do you think it would
take for me to get on the force?

20:12.021 --> 20:14.622
The force? You want to be a cop?

20:14.657 --> 20:16.776
Why not? I mean, I got
the training for it.

20:16.801 --> 20:18.359
You can vouch for me.

20:18.394 --> 20:20.251
Plus, I figure, if they
let you do it, anyone...

20:20.276 --> 20:21.604
Ah, right, right.

20:21.629 --> 20:24.765
Look, I just want to do
something I'm proud of.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.260
You know, bouncing's
no way to make a living.

20:26.285 --> 20:28.213
It's late night, crappy food,

20:28.238 --> 20:29.604
drunks in your friggin'
face all the time.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.716
You know that cops have
all that, too, right?

20:31.741 --> 20:33.941
Yeah, but you get
decent pay and benefits.

20:33.976 --> 20:37.111
Well, there's a lot more
politics involved with it.

20:37.146 --> 20:39.747
I mean, just getting a badge, you got
to jump through all kinds of hoops.

20:39.782 --> 20:42.349
My partner, she's got this
friend at the personnel division,

20:42.374 --> 20:43.984
and they just straight deny
applications all day long.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.552
Whoa, whoa, whoa, she's
got a friend in personnel?

20:45.588 --> 20:46.854
Yeah.

20:47.255 --> 20:49.623
Then call her, put in a word for me.

20:50.442 --> 20:51.829
Oh, come on, man.

20:51.854 --> 20:54.221
I-I just, I need a shot.

20:55.431 --> 20:57.028
All right.

20:57.433 --> 20:59.733
Yeah, I'll give her a call.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.740
What, you want me to call her right now?

21:03.765 --> 21:06.273
Yeah! Come on. Look, I'll
get us some shots, all right?

21:06.309 --> 21:07.608
All right.

21:22.369 --> 21:24.325
Hey. Hey! Get a room.

21:24.360 --> 21:25.877
Aah...

21:52.059 --> 21:53.520
Ha, ha!

21:53.556 --> 21:54.941
Wow, I mean,

21:54.966 --> 21:58.500
I can't believe that Pete
built this in one day.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.090
It's pretty cool, right?

22:00.129 --> 22:02.896
It's like being inside a KISS concert.

22:02.932 --> 22:04.365
Oh, yeah.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.832
Are you people ready to rock and...

22:06.857 --> 22:08.435
You...

22:08.471 --> 22:10.371
What? Never been to a KISS concert?

22:10.406 --> 22:12.387
Sorry, I'm not a hundred years old.

22:12.676 --> 22:15.542
So is this everything from my body-cam?

22:16.050 --> 22:17.939
Can you loop it back?

22:17.964 --> 22:19.813
Stop. Frame zero,

22:19.849 --> 22:23.384
play speed standard,
smooth interpolation,

22:23.419 --> 22:25.113
no blur.

22:25.988 --> 22:28.522
Every time that I look at this,

22:28.557 --> 22:31.051
it just feels like the
fire's coming out of nowhere.

22:31.761 --> 22:33.227
What's that?

22:33.262 --> 22:34.695
Take it back ten seconds.

22:34.730 --> 22:37.043
Frame 455.

22:37.706 --> 22:40.168
Pay attention to the
ducts as we walk by.

22:42.537 --> 22:44.203
That's how it spread so fast.

22:44.228 --> 22:46.762
You can't get into those ducts
without anyone seeing you.

22:46.787 --> 22:49.722
Whoever did this, had access and
knew exactly what they were doing.

22:49.761 --> 22:51.278
So unless Chicago's gangs

22:51.313 --> 22:53.814
have gotten into the heating
and air conditioning business...

22:53.849 --> 22:55.549
We're looking in the wrong place.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.317
Here's the problem, Gideon.

22:57.353 --> 23:00.815
If we don't find this guy fast,
then the Green Street Kings

23:00.840 --> 23:02.909
are gonna burn this
district to the ground.

23:14.837 --> 23:16.170
I'm sorry, Detective.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.040
I don't understand what you mean.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.445
We've been looking
into a series of fires

23:19.470 --> 23:21.141
that've been going on
in the 13th district,

23:21.166 --> 23:22.495
trying to find some kind of a link.

23:22.531 --> 23:23.897
So what do you want with me?

23:23.932 --> 23:25.999
Well, it turns out that
your company has had jobs

23:26.034 --> 23:29.195
for every single one of those
buildings that've been burned.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.637
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:30.672 --> 23:31.972
Are you suggesting I'm involved
in this in some way? I...

23:32.007 --> 23:33.780
No. No, no. Of course not.

23:33.805 --> 23:36.505
But we do think that someone
that works for you might be.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.441
So with your permission,
we'd really like to look

23:38.466 --> 23:39.889
at your employment files.

23:39.914 --> 23:41.944
No. Not gonna do it.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.219
Why not?

23:43.244 --> 23:45.164
Well, I'm not gonna be
railroaded without a warrant.

23:45.189 --> 23:47.266
- I know my rights.
- That's good.

23:47.291 --> 23:48.824
You're a smart man.

23:48.953 --> 23:50.195
How much?

23:50.220 --> 23:51.485
How much for what?

23:51.510 --> 23:54.641
All of it, Mr. Kim. I
want to buy your business.

23:54.666 --> 23:55.758
Oh, it's not for sale.

23:55.793 --> 23:57.414
Well, maybe not, but
I need your records.

23:57.439 --> 23:59.295
So from a negotiation standpoint,

23:59.330 --> 24:00.595
you're in the catbird seat.

24:00.643 --> 24:02.076
Does 300 grand cover it?

24:02.111 --> 24:03.377
Wha... look, this is crazy.

24:03.412 --> 24:05.246
I don't even know how
much my business is worth.

24:05.271 --> 24:06.904
Half a million. Final offer.

24:09.533 --> 24:11.111
Sold.

24:11.855 --> 24:13.463
Here you go.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.826
Uh...

24:16.851 --> 24:19.318
so, s-should I just go, then?

24:19.343 --> 24:21.424
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

24:22.289 --> 24:23.650
Thanks.

24:26.478 --> 24:28.102
Do we need that?

24:28.137 --> 24:29.947
You're unbelievable.

24:34.735 --> 24:38.907
I'd help, but I think you're
better at this than me.

24:39.182 --> 24:40.881
I think you're right.

24:40.917 --> 24:42.750
You and your computer screens.

24:42.785 --> 24:44.752
I mean, can you even read handwriting?

24:44.787 --> 24:46.754
Come on, I bought all the files.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.422
You expect me to read them, too?

24:50.133 --> 24:51.559
Shh.

24:52.789 --> 24:55.129
- Boom.
- What? Find something?

24:55.703 --> 24:58.003
This guy, Duke Johnson.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.238
He was the Lakefront H-VAC
supervisor for both buildings.

25:01.263 --> 25:03.196
I mean, if anybody can
tell us about the guys

25:03.231 --> 25:04.747
that worked there, it's this guy.

25:04.772 --> 25:06.332
But this file's ancient, though.

25:06.368 --> 25:09.208
I mean, there's no
address, there's no number.

25:10.294 --> 25:13.173
It's gonna be impossible
to track him this way.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.341
How about that way?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.380
Well, look at that.

25:23.405 --> 25:25.036
You can read after all.

25:27.708 --> 25:29.241
Hey, Cap, you got a sec?

25:29.266 --> 25:31.601
Well, if I didn't,
it doesn't matter now.

25:31.626 --> 25:33.760
I wanted to talk to you
about a new potential recruit.

25:33.795 --> 25:36.013
Vic Evans. Yeah, I
already got your e-mail.

25:36.038 --> 25:37.604
Oh, good, good.

25:37.833 --> 25:39.766
So you know he was a great soldier.

25:39.801 --> 25:41.482
He's gonna make a great cop.

25:41.507 --> 25:44.542
Not while he's the subject
of an active investigation.

25:44.806 --> 25:46.206
Active?

25:46.241 --> 25:47.507
What do you mean?

25:48.711 --> 25:50.845
Maybe you should talk to your partner.

25:55.779 --> 25:57.946
Tell me you didn't
poison the well for Vic.

25:57.977 --> 25:59.352
I didn't poison anything.

25:59.387 --> 26:01.430
Just not drinking this
dude's Kool-Aid yet.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.940
- Goss, you got to trust me.
- I do trust you.

26:03.976 --> 26:06.309
- I also want to protect you.
- From what?

26:06.345 --> 26:08.345
Look, I know you think you
owe Vic from helping you out

26:08.380 --> 26:10.780
back in the Army, but what if
you get this guy on the force

26:10.816 --> 26:12.663
and he loses his cool on someone?

26:12.688 --> 26:14.184
You really want to put
your ass on the line

26:14.219 --> 26:15.452
for somebody you used to know?

26:15.477 --> 26:16.897
Hey. I'm telling you.

26:16.922 --> 26:19.048
- He's not what you think.
- Good.

26:19.073 --> 26:21.624
Then I'm sure we won't
find anything on this.

26:21.649 --> 26:23.649
It's the alley behind your friend's bar,

26:23.674 --> 26:25.532
where he says he doesn't beat anyone up.

26:25.755 --> 26:27.586
- Oh, hell no.
- Hey.

26:27.611 --> 26:29.477
If he's really the angel you say he is,

26:29.509 --> 26:32.100
you have my word and I'll call
the personnel division myself

26:32.125 --> 26:34.545
and recommend Vic for the academy.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.657
But if I'm right, we arrest his ass

26:36.735 --> 26:39.517
and you buy my iced tea
for the next six months.

26:39.552 --> 26:41.485
You want me to spy on my friend?

26:41.521 --> 26:43.164
No, Brandt.

26:43.963 --> 26:46.664
I want you to back up your partner.

26:55.064 --> 26:58.864
Look, it's not like I wanted
to buy the place, Lauren.

26:58.889 --> 27:00.822
It was just a means to an end.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.003
Okay, well, the only end that
you need to be worried about

27:03.038 --> 27:06.579
is convincing the shareholders
that you are in control of Reeves.

27:06.604 --> 27:08.108
I just finished with the board,

27:08.143 --> 27:10.210
and we have a meet-and-greet
tonight at Gibson's.

27:10.245 --> 27:11.545
Mm. No, no.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.173
I-I don't think I can make that.

27:13.198 --> 27:16.345
All right. Well, I'll cover
for you, like I always do.

27:16.471 --> 27:18.304
But listen, it is very important

27:18.339 --> 27:20.606
that you are prepared
tomorrow. This is a big deal.

27:20.642 --> 27:22.008
Yeah. I've been thinking.

27:22.043 --> 27:24.143
What if I don't give a speech this year?

27:24.178 --> 27:26.879
You could spin it as a good PR move.

27:26.915 --> 27:29.048
Intrigue the shareholders.

27:29.259 --> 27:30.950
You're nervous. I get it.

27:30.985 --> 27:33.586
But just give the speech that I wrote.

27:33.621 --> 27:35.454
You are gonna do great.

27:39.994 --> 27:41.160
You good?

27:42.397 --> 27:44.163
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:44.699 --> 27:48.011
What do you think about
privatized policing?

27:49.604 --> 27:51.237
Like rent-a-cops?

27:51.272 --> 27:52.939
Mm. No, more like actual police.

27:52.974 --> 27:54.838
Like if people could pay

27:54.863 --> 27:57.877
for some of the stuff that
the 13th District does now.

27:59.147 --> 28:00.346
What, what, what?

28:00.381 --> 28:01.847
People want more security.

28:01.883 --> 28:03.683
I'm just supposed to ignore their money?

28:03.718 --> 28:06.997
Gideon, the people who
need our help the most

28:07.022 --> 28:08.597
can't pay for it.

28:09.559 --> 28:12.035
There's this girl, Adriana, from
the last building that burned.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.360
She lost everything in that fire.

28:14.395 --> 28:16.462
If we start protecting rich
people from their shadows,

28:16.497 --> 28:18.698
who's gonna protect people like Adriana?

28:20.316 --> 28:21.534
Fair point, yes.

28:21.569 --> 28:25.004
But I do have a responsibility
to my shareholders

28:25.039 --> 28:26.906
as Lauren reminds me twice a day.

28:26.941 --> 28:29.742
Well, I'm one of those shareholders.

28:29.777 --> 28:31.824
And I don't think it's a good idea.

28:32.227 --> 28:33.893
What are you talking about?

28:33.918 --> 28:36.415
I bought a couple shares
in Reeves Industries.

28:36.451 --> 28:38.150
Mateo's college fund.

28:38.186 --> 28:40.720
So, do I want you to make money? Yeah.

28:40.755 --> 28:43.214
But not if it means selling my badge.

28:46.327 --> 28:48.127
The job site's up here.

28:48.162 --> 28:49.628
Okay.

28:49.664 --> 28:50.997
If Duke can tell us
who we're looking for,

28:51.032 --> 28:52.732
then we might beat Andre to the punch.

28:52.767 --> 28:55.035
... And now they're telling
us that we have to be

28:55.060 --> 28:57.547
some kind of sanctuary
city? Can you believe that?

28:57.572 --> 28:59.205
We need to march on city
hall and tell the mayor

28:59.240 --> 29:01.407
that Chicago is for Americans.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.349
I've had enough of
this liberal, multi...

29:03.378 --> 29:04.910
Duke Johnson?

29:04.946 --> 29:07.691
Yeah, that's me.

29:07.716 --> 29:10.205
Detective Murphy, CPD.

29:10.230 --> 29:12.485
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

29:12.510 --> 29:14.562
... The immigrants come in...

29:14.587 --> 29:15.980
Hey!

29:24.858 --> 29:26.190
Stop!

29:27.417 --> 29:28.467
Gideon, move!

29:30.969 --> 29:32.402
Damn it!

29:34.142 --> 29:35.741
It's okay.

29:35.777 --> 29:37.143
It's just my ankle.

29:37.178 --> 29:38.589
We lost him.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.592
Well...

29:45.680 --> 29:47.264
not entirely.

29:55.875 --> 29:57.179
Hey.

29:57.445 --> 29:58.794
How's the foot?

29:58.819 --> 30:01.112
It'd be better if you told me we
got something out of that phone.

30:01.148 --> 30:03.615
Well, then get ready for
a miraculous recovery.

30:03.651 --> 30:05.817
We checked the cell's location history.

30:05.853 --> 30:07.853
Turns out Duke the Supervisor

30:07.888 --> 30:09.888
has been spending a lot of
time in an old warehouse.

30:09.923 --> 30:12.187
Yeah, it's a place he
used to own in Fuller Park?

30:12.212 --> 30:14.656
It's been abandoned since he
filed for bankruptcy in '08.

30:14.681 --> 30:16.257
Send the address to my car.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.563
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Are you sure?

30:18.599 --> 30:20.825
I can still kick ass with my good foot.

30:21.306 --> 30:23.640
- I actually believe her.
- I do, too.

30:27.441 --> 30:29.741
This is a complete waste of time.

30:29.777 --> 30:31.943
Yeah. You mentioned that.

30:31.979 --> 30:35.113
And told me I was full
of crap at least twice.

30:35.149 --> 30:37.508
Well, you know. If the poo fits.

30:37.533 --> 30:38.966
Shut up.

30:39.119 --> 30:41.422
Uh... he's coming out again.

30:41.868 --> 30:43.522
Come on, man.

30:43.557 --> 30:45.766
Kicking me out over a
little spilled drink?

30:45.791 --> 30:47.946
You spilled three drinks
on two girls, all right?

30:47.971 --> 30:50.594
All right, you've had
enough. Just head home, pal.

30:50.864 --> 30:52.064
There.

30:52.099 --> 30:53.098
Do you see that?

30:53.133 --> 30:55.567
One more politely escorted drunk.

30:56.001 --> 30:58.704
How much longer do we need to do this?

30:59.172 --> 31:01.907
Yeah, what if I don't want to go? Huh?

31:01.932 --> 31:04.391
What you gonna do then, bouncer boy?

31:12.490 --> 31:14.313
Oh, damn it.

31:19.229 --> 31:21.072
- Hey, hey.
- Vic!

31:21.097 --> 31:22.292
Chicago Police.

31:22.317 --> 31:23.783
Put him down, Vic!

31:28.613 --> 31:30.908
Hey, Hey, hey, hey, hey, bud.

31:30.933 --> 31:32.565
What the hell's wrong with you, man?!

31:32.605 --> 31:34.034
Squad, we need an ambulance.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.792
Just stay still, just stay still...

31:36.109 --> 31:38.081
Calm down, just calm down.

31:42.949 --> 31:45.424
Got Murphy, Cobb and
Reyes at the warehouse

31:45.449 --> 31:47.343
we found on Duke Johnson's phone.

31:47.368 --> 31:50.141
Great, great, great. Let's
just hope he's in there.

31:59.509 --> 32:01.573
Welcome to Hatefest.

32:01.968 --> 32:04.542
What kind of sicko is this guy?

32:05.550 --> 32:08.406
The kind that spells
America with three "K" 's.

32:08.441 --> 32:10.691
This bastard just
wanted to hurt immigrants

32:10.745 --> 32:13.087
and let Andre and his
boys take the heat.

32:13.112 --> 32:14.363
Let's go see if we can find him.

32:21.845 --> 32:23.078
Need more backup.

32:23.103 --> 32:26.171
Yeah, especially with a
Nazi firebug on the loose.

32:31.864 --> 32:33.712
Freeze. Police.

32:34.525 --> 32:36.834
Drop the can and put
your hands over your head.

32:36.869 --> 32:38.903
Easy, chica.

32:38.938 --> 32:40.814
This stuff's very flammable.

32:40.839 --> 32:43.341
Do what I told you, you
racist son of a bitch.

32:43.376 --> 32:45.103
It's not a problem.

32:45.128 --> 32:46.828
No problemo.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.779
Squad, offender on the move and
he set the damn place on fire.

32:57.423 --> 32:58.889
Gideon, they need help.

32:58.925 --> 33:00.739
Yeah, I can see that.

33:08.956 --> 33:10.154
Let him go, Murph.

33:10.179 --> 33:11.810
Just get out of there.

33:15.975 --> 33:18.075
Squad, the offender's exiting

33:18.111 --> 33:19.911
from the east side of the building.

33:22.915 --> 33:24.489
Reyes, they're headed your way.

33:24.514 --> 33:26.044
Try and cut him off.

33:27.487 --> 33:28.630
Chicago Police.

33:28.661 --> 33:30.450
You're under arrest, you son of a bitch.

33:31.818 --> 33:33.591
Well done, guys.

33:33.616 --> 33:35.141
Offender's in custody.

33:35.166 --> 33:37.733
Good, now let's get Murphy out of there.

33:47.513 --> 33:49.440
Uh, guys?

33:49.475 --> 33:51.052
Hang on, Murphy.

33:52.436 --> 33:54.102
I'm coming.

33:59.694 --> 34:01.069
Yeah, thanks.

34:01.094 --> 34:02.890
Fire department's a ways out,

34:02.915 --> 34:04.296
at least another eight, ten minutes.

34:04.321 --> 34:06.072
I'll be there in two, tops.

34:06.097 --> 34:07.497
What the hell's a drone gonna do?

34:07.532 --> 34:09.098
This is not an ordinary drone.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.234
This is the TK421.

34:11.268 --> 34:13.670
This one uses a concussive
charge to extinguish flames.

34:13.705 --> 34:15.913
You're gonna blow up the fire?

34:19.641 --> 34:21.524
Murph. Stay low.

34:21.549 --> 34:23.657
Short, shallow breaths.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.722
There's no way back in.

34:32.757 --> 34:35.123
Which means there's no way back out.

34:42.217 --> 34:43.697
Okay, drone's on site.

34:43.722 --> 34:44.721
Talk to me, Ada.

34:44.746 --> 34:46.803
There's got to be
some way to get inside.

34:46.828 --> 34:49.100
There's an opening in
the roof on the east wall.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.272
Okay. Big enough for this drone?

34:51.297 --> 34:52.780
I don't know. It's
about eight feed wide.

34:52.804 --> 34:54.030
It's gonna be pretty difficult.

34:54.054 --> 34:56.021
Well, I do love a challenge.

34:56.045 --> 34:58.358
- Murph, you still with me?
- Yeah, but...

34:58.383 --> 35:00.149
I don't know how much longer.

35:08.388 --> 35:09.640
Murph,

35:09.665 --> 35:12.338
I'm gonna clear a path for
you and you're gonna run, okay?

35:12.363 --> 35:14.044
Okay, okay.

35:14.069 --> 35:15.872
Murph, one more thing.

35:16.099 --> 35:17.771
This could get a little loud.

35:17.796 --> 35:19.396
Go now!

35:31.259 --> 35:34.360
You got this, Murph.
Just a little bit further.

35:34.842 --> 35:36.441
Almost there.

35:41.943 --> 35:43.629
Go!

35:51.565 --> 35:53.265
Hey, hey. We got, we
got you, we got you.

35:53.290 --> 35:54.356
She's out!

35:55.249 --> 35:56.697
Thank God.

35:58.374 --> 35:59.740
And me.

36:00.379 --> 36:02.003
And-and God.

36:13.601 --> 36:15.264
Hey, bro.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.603
Hey.

36:18.119 --> 36:20.015
Sorry about last night.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.839
Just got a little amped up.

36:27.482 --> 36:29.850
Why don't you just let me
go home and sleep it off?

36:30.277 --> 36:32.414
I can't do that, Vic.

36:34.236 --> 36:35.916
You lied to us.

36:41.414 --> 36:44.340
Someone comes at me, I just suddenly...

36:45.235 --> 36:46.762
black out.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.681
Yeah, well, um...

36:54.142 --> 36:56.361
now, listen, I'll, uh...

36:57.412 --> 36:59.545
I'll talk to the prosecutor.

37:00.743 --> 37:03.399
I'll see if he'll consider
your service record.

37:03.718 --> 37:06.020
See about getting you some real help.

37:10.817 --> 37:12.100
Brando.

37:14.595 --> 37:16.295
Thanks, brother.

37:25.239 --> 37:27.119
You talk to him?

37:28.324 --> 37:29.641
Yeah.

37:34.215 --> 37:36.415
Sorry I was such a jerk.

37:36.939 --> 37:39.794
Listen, I know he's your buddy, and...

37:39.819 --> 37:42.408
Yeah, but you're my partner.

37:43.026 --> 37:44.826
Next time I'll listen.

37:47.916 --> 37:49.493
Needs more sugar.

37:57.732 --> 37:59.472
In light of Johnson's arrest,

37:59.497 --> 38:02.098
the gang conflict that has
plagued the 13th district

38:02.123 --> 38:04.256
is rumored to be nearing a truce.

38:04.415 --> 38:05.694
Leaders from both sides...

38:05.719 --> 38:07.513
I hate the way I look on TV.

38:07.548 --> 38:08.627
You looked amazing.

38:08.652 --> 38:10.359
I can't believe you actually caught him.

38:10.384 --> 38:13.165
Well, it takes a special
kind of crazy to do that job.

38:14.098 --> 38:15.864
I was thinking...

38:16.524 --> 38:19.725
maybe I'd like to be that kind of crazy.

38:19.760 --> 38:21.193
You want to be a cop?

38:21.229 --> 38:22.736
Do you think I could do it?

38:22.761 --> 38:25.297
Yeah, I think you can do
anything you want to do.

38:27.335 --> 38:28.667
Shoot, I'm late.

38:28.703 --> 38:29.935
Um, do you mind waiting

38:29.971 --> 38:32.004
until Mateo and Mita
come back from the store?

38:32.039 --> 38:33.205
She's an awesome cook.

38:33.241 --> 38:35.197
Don't worry. I'm happy.

38:35.222 --> 38:36.809
Okay, good.

38:37.807 --> 38:39.907
As you all know,

38:39.932 --> 38:44.103
I have solved a lot of
tough problems in my life.

38:44.232 --> 38:47.196
Reusable rocket stages,

38:47.221 --> 38:50.019
asteroid hunting telescopes,

38:50.044 --> 38:53.528
you name it, but, uh, you know what?

38:53.895 --> 38:57.377
I never faced a problem
tougher than law enforcement.

38:58.563 --> 39:02.974
In engineering, math,
problems have solutions.

39:02.999 --> 39:04.231
Once you figure them out, you're done.

39:04.256 --> 39:06.603
You're ready for a new challenge.

39:07.542 --> 39:09.608
But as long as one person in the world

39:09.644 --> 39:13.550
still wants to take unfair
advantage of another,

39:13.848 --> 39:16.306
there's no real solution to crime.

39:17.118 --> 39:21.775
Now, fortunately, a
problem being unsolvable

39:21.800 --> 39:24.339
does not mean that it can't make money,

39:24.433 --> 39:28.235
which is why in the next fiscal quarter,

39:28.260 --> 39:31.917
Reeves Industries will
proudly introduce...

39:31.942 --> 39:34.043
APB Prime.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.074
Bravo!

39:47.036 --> 39:50.394
This revolutionary approach...

39:50.419 --> 39:53.313
to privatized policing...

39:53.688 --> 39:56.239
will offer Reeves customers...

39:57.077 --> 40:00.202
a new level of personal security...

40:00.995 --> 40:02.922
on a pay-as-you-go...

40:02.947 --> 40:06.885
or subscription basis.

40:09.046 --> 40:13.523
So, uh, whether we are
working in tandem...

40:13.548 --> 40:15.582
with local law enforcement...

40:17.820 --> 40:20.713
or offering our services à la carte...

40:20.748 --> 40:23.537
to an elite clientele...

40:24.620 --> 40:26.387
um...

40:27.611 --> 40:29.777
yeah, we're not doing any of that.

40:31.287 --> 40:33.627
♪ Get up slow ♪

40:34.724 --> 40:37.058
♪ Come down... ♪

40:37.611 --> 40:39.537
Here's the deal.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.912
I started this company from
a South Side storage space

40:42.937 --> 40:46.171
and turned it into the global
powerhouse that it is today.

40:46.207 --> 40:49.408
Seven divisions, 28,000 employees,

40:49.453 --> 40:51.894
48 billion in the bank,
and I used to think

40:51.919 --> 40:55.235
that making those numbers
bigger was all that mattered.

40:55.260 --> 40:57.064
But in the last few months,

40:57.526 --> 40:59.529
I've looked at some new numbers.

41:00.755 --> 41:04.323
3,248 shootings.

41:06.024 --> 41:08.468
564 homicides.

41:08.901 --> 41:11.249
14 cases of deadly arson.

41:11.274 --> 41:13.156
That's just Chicago.

41:13.744 --> 41:16.278
So, all that matters to me now

41:16.303 --> 41:18.355
is making those numbers smaller...

41:19.707 --> 41:21.106
no matter what the cost.

41:21.291 --> 41:23.255
Listen...

41:23.375 --> 41:25.151
I've made each and
every one of you folks

41:25.184 --> 41:26.849
a crap-load of money.

41:26.874 --> 41:28.574
So, like it or not,

41:29.016 --> 41:31.366
you're just gonna have
to trust me on this one.

41:36.017 --> 41:37.249
Gideon out.
