our Italian plumber.

that are small enough

- Eeeaaa eeewww.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.274
- He died?!

10:08.341 --> 10:10.443
- Look, let's stop talking about
dead chimps

10:10.509 --> 10:14.080
and just be thankful that we got
really lucky this time.

10:14.146 --> 10:16.949
KID DANGER: Hey, is everything
okay out there?

10:17.016 --> 10:19.852
- Yeah, yeah, no one's surprised
you're alive.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.620
- I am.
KID DANGER: What?

10:21.687 --> 10:24.690
- Nothing! We're going to put
you inside Ray's head now.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.225
KID DANGER: Okay.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.194
- Hi, Raayyyy...

10:29.495 --> 10:31.430
Just gonna put
a liiiiiittle drop of water

10:31.497 --> 10:34.133
{\an5}in your earrr...
- What's that?
I don't want that.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.268
I don't know what that is
but I know I don't want it.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.404
Get away from that part of me
that I can't name!

10:38.471 --> 10:40.106
You don't even know what it is,
hey, come on hold still...

10:40.172 --> 10:43.642
- Hey! Ray!
Look at this guy on my phone!

10:43.709 --> 10:47.947
- Well, hello handsome...

10:48.014 --> 10:51.751
Oh, oh, oh. Where you goin'?

10:51.817 --> 10:54.487
- Whhoooooooooaaaaaaaaaa!

10:54.553 --> 10:56.956
- Oo, that tickles...

10:57.023 --> 11:01.460
Don't take him away from me!
- Ohhhh-kay...

11:01.527 --> 11:04.030
- Missed you.

11:05.364 --> 11:06.832
[ music ]

11:06.899 --> 11:08.401
- And that's everything
that's happened

11:08.467 --> 11:10.836
since I found out
Henry's secret.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.172
- Wow...No way...

11:13.239 --> 11:15.908
- I know crazy story, eh?

11:18.744 --> 11:20.813
You're not Piper.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.082
- What?
- You're not Piper.

11:23.149 --> 11:25.184
- I know. I'm Mandy.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.787
- What happened to Piper?

11:27.853 --> 11:30.022
- She sent me twenty bucks to
walk behind you and say,

11:30.089 --> 11:35.828
"Wow..." and "No way..."
every thirty seconds.

11:35.895 --> 11:39.532
Wow. No way.

11:47.673 --> 11:51.377
{\an5}- Okay Henry, in twenty
seconds you have to push
the pink button.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.379
Starting countdown...
now.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.481
- Okay...
where's the pink button?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.050
- It's on the navigation panel
on your right hand side.

11:58.117 --> 12:01.387
Now press the pink button only.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.223
- This is where
Handsy messed up.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.229
- Dude, they're all pink!
- No, they're not.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.399
One is salmon, one is
bubble gum, one is flamingo...

12:13.466 --> 12:14.967
[ alarm goes off ]

12:15.034 --> 12:17.903
- Running out of time here...
- Hit the pink button now!

12:17.970 --> 12:19.238
- Which one is pink?!
Tell me where!

12:19.305 --> 12:21.006
Pick a corner, left, right
or down or--

12:21.073 --> 12:23.576
- It's this one!

12:23.642 --> 12:25.644
- That's pink.

12:25.711 --> 12:26.846
- Piper?!

12:26.912 --> 12:28.414
- Piper?!
- Henry's sister?!

12:28.481 --> 12:31.183
- Ugh, why are boys
so bad with colors?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.586
Am I right, Charlotte?

12:33.652 --> 12:35.921
- What are you doing here?!
- What is she doing there?!

12:35.988 --> 12:37.490
- Yeah what are you doing here?!

12:37.556 --> 12:39.558
- Well, I ditched Jasper,
came back to the Man Cave

12:39.625 --> 12:42.928
and snuck on board.
This ship is bananas.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.697
Do you do stuff
like this all the time?!

12:44.763 --> 12:46.832
- I don't know maybe not all
the time like once a week.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.434
I can't believe
you snuck on board!

12:48.501 --> 12:50.603
- You put Jasper in charge of
taking me home,

12:50.669 --> 12:52.438
what did you think
was gonna happen?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.340
{\an5}- Uh, guys?
- You're not trained
for this, Piper.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.609
Okay? This is not okay.
- Oh you are so trained.

12:56.675 --> 12:58.611
{\an5}- Oh, I am trained.
- You think it's okay to lie
to your whole family?

12:58.677 --> 13:00.746
You can't even find
a pink button!

13:00.813 --> 13:02.748
{\an5}- What do you mean? Oh, how am
I supposed to know
which one's pink, Piper?

13:02.815 --> 13:04.717
- Well that one's Cerise.
- They're all pink!

13:04.783 --> 13:07.119
- That's French Rose.
I can go all day, Henry.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.120
All pinkin' day!
- YOU GUYS!

13:08.187 --> 13:09.688
- What?!
- Ugh, what?

13:09.755 --> 13:11.957
- You're at the hippocampus!
SCHWOZ: Emergency stop!

13:12.024 --> 13:14.193
- No, no, no, Piper,
don't touch anythi--

13:16.829 --> 13:19.465
COMPUTER: You have arrived
at your destination.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.468
- How did you...
know how to...

13:22.535 --> 13:24.303
- I know what
an emergency brake is.

13:24.370 --> 13:27.940
I have a driver's license.
- Established.

13:28.007 --> 13:29.408
- We get it.
- Even I know that.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.143
- What do we do now, Schwoz?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.879
- Give me that, you don't know
Schwoz like I do.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.915
What do we do now, Schwoz?

13:35.981 --> 13:40.119
{\an5}- Okay, you have to arm
the electrical pulse inducer
before you set it...

13:40.186 --> 13:41.754
- Okay, how do we do that?

13:41.820 --> 13:45.391
- ...so press the light blue
button on your left hand side.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.930
- Are you kidding me right now?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.666
- That's Summer Sky.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.268
Swiss Ocean.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.971
Theeeere you go...

13:59.038 --> 14:00.272
- There are no oceans
in Switzerland

14:00.339 --> 14:01.674
who even comes up
with these color names--

14:01.740 --> 14:02.908
- We're armed.

14:02.975 --> 14:05.344
- Nooo, I could stare at you
all day.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.681
Nooooo,
I could stare at you all day.

14:08.747 --> 14:11.183
What's a day?
Awwww...

14:11.250 --> 14:14.587
SCHWOZ: You to locate the--

14:18.090 --> 14:19.758
- Okay, the charge is set.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.861
- Great! Now you have two
minutes to get out of Ray's head

14:22.928 --> 14:24.496
before that charge goes off.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.032
- Wait -- what? Why do we have
to get out in two minutes?!

14:27.099 --> 14:28.367
- Well, you don't have to...

14:28.434 --> 14:30.202
...but if you don't get out
of there

14:30.269 --> 14:32.438
before the electrical pulse
inducer goes off,

14:32.504 --> 14:34.506
the blast will short out
the capsule

14:34.573 --> 14:36.275
and you'll be stuck
in Ray's head.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.378
- Forever?!
- Welllll... no...

14:39.445 --> 14:43.382
I meannn...
yes... Yes.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.988
- Dude, why didn't you just make
a pulse inducer

14:49.054 --> 14:52.725
that detonates remotely?
- Yeah!

14:52.791 --> 14:54.326
- That's a great idea.

14:54.393 --> 14:58.030
I'll do that the next time
you wipe Ray's memories.

14:58.097 --> 14:59.498
- Waahhh!

14:59.565 --> 15:01.066
- Whatever,
we're on our way.

15:01.133 --> 15:04.236
Meet me at Ray's left ear.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.804
- You should have
plenty of time, Henry.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.340
- Yeah, you'll be fine.
As long as nothing goes wrong.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.242
- Come on, Man!
- Dude!

15:10.309 --> 15:11.710
- Why would you say that?!

15:11.777 --> 15:13.912
- Relax, nothing bad's
going to happen.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.648
- Meew, meew!

15:15.714 --> 15:18.350
- Ahhh what's happening?!
- I knew it.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.720
[ alarms go off in the capsule ]

15:21.787 --> 15:23.589
- I never thought
I'd see you again.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.091
KID DANGER: Schwoz! There's a
bunch of alarms going off

15:26.158 --> 15:28.827
and lights blinking!
- What color lights?

15:28.894 --> 15:30.362
- Uh...
Swiss Sky...

15:30.429 --> 15:32.731
Flamingo Ocean...
THEY'RE ALL BLINKING, SCHWOZ!

15:32.798 --> 15:35.567
- Don't worry...
there's no need to panic...

15:35.634 --> 15:38.737
- Uh, there's a tube hanging
off the ship,

15:38.804 --> 15:41.273
and it's leaking something
all over the place.

15:41.340 --> 15:46.011
- What?
- That's the fuel line.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.946
- Is that bad?

15:48.013 --> 15:50.349
- Welllll...
no...

15:50.416 --> 15:53.218
I meannn...
yes...

15:53.285 --> 15:54.953
Yes. Panic.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.455
- Aaahhhh!

15:56.522 --> 15:58.223
- Schwoz, what are they
supposed to do?!

15:58.290 --> 16:00.492
- I got this!
- I don't know what to do!

16:09.702 --> 16:12.538
- Try pushing other buttons!
- I don't think that will work.

16:12.604 --> 16:13.939
- Try the Cerulean one.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.874
- That's not a real color.
- Yes it is.

16:15.941 --> 16:19.611
- God this guy's so frustrating!
What'd you say about me?!

16:19.678 --> 16:23.649
- Okay, everyone shut up!

16:23.716 --> 16:25.417
- Wow he sounds mean.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.819
He does sound mean.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.388
Ulch, I love you
let's never fight again.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.159
- Now, Schwoz, there's gotta be
something we can do to fix this.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.829
- Well... there is but you
have to go outside the capsule

16:36.895 --> 16:38.397
and plug the fuel line
back in.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.832
- Okay, so how do we do that?

16:39.898 --> 16:43.102
- First press the "Release
Emergency Suit" button.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.671
It's baby bunny pink.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.439
- How many stinkin'
colorful buttons are there

16:47.506 --> 16:50.542
in this stupid capsule...
- Found it!

16:57.416 --> 17:00.519
- Uhh... something's
going on with Ray.

17:00.586 --> 17:03.856
- I just think you're real--
mmphmmphth.

17:03.922 --> 17:06.992
I also find you very--
mmphmmphth.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.794
- Uh oh.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.630
The fuel leak from the capsule
is affecting Ray's brain.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.133
Go get him to hold still.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.602
- Hate this job...

17:17.536 --> 17:19.538
- Ahh!
- Ahhh!

17:19.605 --> 17:20.772
- Stop it! Come on!

17:20.839 --> 17:22.808
- Okay, now, Henry...
put on the suit

17:22.875 --> 17:24.877
and crawl outside the capsule--

17:24.943 --> 17:26.545
- Uh yeah, about that...

17:26.612 --> 17:28.547
This suit is way too small
for me.

17:28.614 --> 17:31.383
- Well it fit Handsy
perfectly.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.051
- I can fit inside...

17:33.118 --> 17:35.187
- What, no, you're not going
outside this capsule, Piper.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.389
End of story.
- Well, that story is lame,

17:37.456 --> 17:38.791
and I'm goin' out there.
- No you're not.

17:38.857 --> 17:40.192
Schwoz, is there any way for me

17:40.259 --> 17:42.294
to go outside
this capsule without the suit?

17:42.361 --> 17:44.029
- Yeah, lotsa ways.
- Nice!

17:44.096 --> 17:45.831
- But they all result
in you being dead.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.299
- Gaaahhh!

17:47.366 --> 17:50.903
- Calm down, Ray, you're gonna
kill Henry and Piper!

17:50.969 --> 17:54.840
- WHO IS RAY?!
- Ahh! No!!

17:54.907 --> 17:57.976
- Henry, just let your sister go
outside and fix the fuel line!

17:58.043 --> 17:59.745
KID DANGER:
No, it's too dangerous!

17:59.812 --> 18:02.581
Okay, I'm the sidekick,
I'm gonna risk my life by--

18:02.648 --> 18:04.583
PIPER: Done!
- What?

18:04.650 --> 18:07.586
- I fixed it.
Let's go.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.421
- Did you seriously
just fix that?

18:09.488 --> 18:10.722
Because that would be
impressive.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.091
- Get me outta this guy's head,
Schwoz!

18:13.158 --> 18:16.261
Ahh!

18:16.328 --> 18:19.064
{\an5}SCHWOZ: Okay, there's
not enough time for you
to get to Ray's ear.

18:19.131 --> 18:21.066
So you have to go out
of a different hole.

18:21.133 --> 18:23.535
The one that smells.
- Oh god no!

18:23.602 --> 18:26.572
- Yeah, that's gonna be
a no from me, dog.

18:26.638 --> 18:28.540
- I'm talking about his nose.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.777
{\an5}- Ohhhh, the one that smells.
- Oh yeah, I can go through
a nose any day.

18:31.844 --> 18:34.379
- Just turn when I tell you
and you might get out on time!

18:34.446 --> 18:38.016
{\an5}- Got it.
- Okay move over, Piper,
I'm drivi--

18:38.083 --> 18:40.786
- Left! Right!

18:40.853 --> 18:44.890
Left! Left right left right
left right!

18:44.957 --> 18:46.358
- I love this!

18:46.425 --> 18:48.861
- I... hate...
this...

18:51.530 --> 18:57.603
- Now stop!

18:57.669 --> 18:59.738
They're in his nose.
You have to get them out!

18:59.805 --> 19:03.575
- How?
- Use this!

19:03.642 --> 19:05.143
- What do I do with this?!

19:05.210 --> 19:08.280
- Shove it up his hole that
smells and suck them out!

19:08.347 --> 19:11.550
- Just say nose!
- Do it now!

19:11.617 --> 19:14.820
KID DANGER: Hello?
What's taking so long?

19:14.887 --> 19:16.488
PIPER: Get us out of here,
Schwoz!

19:16.555 --> 19:20.325
- ...six, five, four, three...

19:20.392 --> 19:23.495
two, one...
pulse.

19:23.562 --> 19:29.067
- Dtt! Dtt! Daaahh!
Gaahhh!!

19:38.877 --> 19:42.514
Schwoz.
Charlotte.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.183
{\an5}What happened to Henry
and his awful sister?
KID DANGER: Hello?!

19:45.250 --> 19:46.919
PIPER: Get us out
of this snot bubble!

19:46.985 --> 19:51.757
- They're alive!
- Yeah, they're alive!

19:51.823 --> 19:56.028
- Yeah!!
Why are we cheering?!

20:00.566 --> 20:01.934
- ...and that's how we all
worked together

20:02.000 --> 20:05.470
to restore your memory.
- Mm-hmm. That's right.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.838
Ray?

20:06.905 --> 20:07.973
- Yeah?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.175
- Were you listening
to any of that?

20:10.242 --> 20:12.544
- Oh. No. I've been staring at
my face in my phone

20:12.611 --> 20:14.813
for the past ten minutes.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.017
You guys, I'm so good looking.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.953
- Good to have you back, buddy.
- What is wrong with you?

20:21.019 --> 20:22.654
- Some things never change.
- Is he always like this?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.023
HENRY: Yes.
- Hey, why do I have to

20:25.090 --> 20:27.059
wash the capsule?
I wasn't even here.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.894
- Because you were supposed to
take Henry's sister

20:28.961 --> 20:31.029
back to her house.
And you failed.

20:31.096 --> 20:33.565
- Well why do I have to wear
these jean shorts while I do it?

20:33.632 --> 20:35.801
{\an5}- You don't have to.
- We begged you
not to wear them.

20:35.867 --> 20:37.869
- Hey!
We should be going.

20:37.936 --> 20:40.205
- Oh! That reminds me.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.341
Juuuuuuuust stare into
the barrel for me.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.575
- Dude!
- Ah!

20:43.642 --> 20:44.977
- What?!

20:45.043 --> 20:46.812
- You can't wipe
my sister's memory!

20:46.878 --> 20:49.081
- Yeah, I'm the only reason
you got your memory back.

20:49.147 --> 20:50.749
- And you're also
the only reason

20:50.816 --> 20:52.484
I got my memory got wiped
in the first place.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.586
{\an5}- So we're even!
- Don't you point
your finger at me.

20:54.653 --> 20:55.887
- What are you
going to do about it?

20:55.954 --> 20:57.255
- Uh, I'm gonna wipe
your memory.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.759
- No! You're not!
- Oh like you think--

21:00.826 --> 21:02.227
[ alarm goes off ]

21:02.294 --> 21:04.363
- Ooh, what's that?

21:04.429 --> 21:08.700
- Emergency alarm.
- Yes! Where are we going?

21:08.767 --> 21:10.769
- You're going home!
- What?!

21:10.836 --> 21:12.270
- Jasper, walk her home.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.406
- I think we all know I can not
be trusted to do that.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.142
[ sighs ] - C'mon.
I'll walk both of you home.

21:19.177 --> 21:20.879
- Hey Charlotte, have I ever
told you the story

21:20.946 --> 21:22.714
of how I found out
Henry was Kid Danger?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.549
- I was there.
- It all just kinda happened...

21:24.616 --> 21:26.184
- Oh my god.
- I was there!

21:26.251 --> 21:29.254
- Do you still remember
how to do this, buddy?

21:29.321 --> 21:30.922
- Yes.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.994
I'm just gonna place it.
- Okay.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.701
[ music ]

21:44.336 --> 21:46.905
- Glad to be part of the team
byeeeee!

21:46.972 --> 21:48.707
- You're not part of the team!

21:48.774 --> 21:51.143
Tell her
she's not part of the team!

21:51.209 --> 21:52.944
Well hello handsome.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.480
- Where are you going?
Where are you going, dude?

21:55.547 --> 21:56.948
That's my phone!
- I'm busy, Henry.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.051
There's an emergency.

21:59.117 --> 22:00.452
Where are you
going with that?!

22:00.519 --> 22:02.220
- That's right. You got this.
