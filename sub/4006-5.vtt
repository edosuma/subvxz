12:58.083 --> 12:59.917
JUST WANT TO CONFIRM
WE'RE STILL ON

12:59.917 --> 13:02.000
FOR 1:00
AT SCHOONER OR LATER

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
AT TWELFTH AND BAYSHORE DRIVE.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.250
SEE YOU THERE.
[cell phone beeps]

13:23.625 --> 13:24.875
[door opens]

13:24.875 --> 13:28.500
I'VE MET HIM BEFORE AT THE BAR
AT THE FOX HOLE--

13:28.500 --> 13:31.250
OWNED BY
THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.667
THE MAN WHO KILLED
MIKE ANDERSON,

13:32.667 --> 13:35.291
VIKTOR BASKOV,
WAS ONE OF THE KOSHKAS.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.083
COULD THEY HAVE FIGURED OUT
I KILLED VIKTOR

13:37.083 --> 13:39.750
AND SENT A HIT MAN
AFTER ME?

13:41.625 --> 13:44.750
[indistinct chatter]

13:58.458 --> 13:59.959
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES.

13:59.959 --> 14:02.500
- I THINK I HAVE A PHONE CALL
FOR YOU.

14:02.500 --> 14:06.250
- A SMALL COFFEE, PLEASE.

14:06.250 --> 14:07.750
HELLO?

14:07.750 --> 14:10.083
- WHY WERE YOU
IN MY APARTMENT?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.417
- WELL, AREN'T YOU
MR. SMARTY-PANTS?

14:12.417 --> 14:13.458
[camera shutter clicks]

14:13.458 --> 14:14.750
- ANSWER THE QUESTION.

14:14.750 --> 14:16.667
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
IN MY PLACE?

14:16.667 --> 14:18.583
- I WAS LOOKING TO HAVE
A DISCUSSION

14:18.583 --> 14:21.709
ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO'S GONE MISSING--VIKTOR.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.458
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER HIM.

14:23.458 --> 14:25.375
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.834
- I DON'T CARE FOR LIES.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.458
- I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.000
- YOU'RE WASTING BOTH OUR TIME.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.125
LOUIS GREENE--
WHO I FOUND ON YOUR BOAT,

14:34.125 --> 14:37.458
THE BOAT THAT WAS USED TO DUMP
VIKTOR IN THE OCEAN--

14:37.458 --> 14:38.834
GAVE ME YOUR NAME.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.792
- SO YOU KILLED LOUIS.

14:41.792 --> 14:45.709
- WE HAD A CONVERSATION
THAT ENDED RATHER ABRUPTLY, YES.

14:45.709 --> 14:47.750
- WHAT ELSE DID LOUIS SAY?

14:47.750 --> 14:50.166
- I BELIEVE
HE MAY HAVE REFERRED TO YOU

14:50.166 --> 14:51.750
AS A DOUCHE BAG.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.542
- YOU THINK YOU'RE VERY CLEVER.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.792
- I DO, ACTUALLY, YES.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.125
- YOUR BOSSES
AT THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD--

14:57.125 --> 14:59.375
THEY SENT YOU?
- AH...

14:59.375 --> 15:02.875
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.917
THERE ARE NO BOSSES
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

15:04.917 --> 15:07.375
VIKTOR WAS A FRIEND OF MINE.
THIS IS PERSONAL.

15:07.375 --> 15:08.959
- SO AN EYE FOR AN EYE, HUH?

15:08.959 --> 15:11.583
YOUR FRIEND VIKTOR KILLS
AN INNOCENT WOMAN AND A COP,

15:11.583 --> 15:14.542
AND KILLING ME
SOMEHOW SETTLES THE SCORE?

15:14.542 --> 15:16.083
- OH, YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.542
I'M NOT STOPPING WITH YOU.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.625
I ALSO WANT ANY
OF YOUR POLICE OFFICER FRIENDS

15:20.625 --> 15:22.208
INVOLVED
IN THIS LITTLE VENDETTA...

15:22.208 --> 15:23.291
- WAIT.

15:23.291 --> 15:25.291
- INCLUDING
YOUR LIEUTENANT SISTER.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.208
I'VE DONE MY HOMEWORK TOO.

15:27.208 --> 15:30.875
- IT WAS JUST ME.
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.375
- HELLO, HANDSOME.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.709
- I WORK ALONE.

15:35.709 --> 15:37.959
I KILLED VIKTOR--ONLY ME.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.375
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.083
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.750
- WHY IN FUCK-VILLE
ARE YOU TELLING ME

15:45.750 --> 15:47.250
TO MEET YOU
IN THE PARKING GARAGE?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.917
- BECAUSE OF HIM.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.583
- DO YOU WANT TO BE
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC?

15:50.583 --> 15:51.792
- HIS NAME IS ISAAK SIRKO.

15:51.792 --> 15:54.667
HE'S PART
OF THE KOSHKA BROTHERHOOD.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.333
HE'S AFTER ME.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.667
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.875
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.458
- BUT YOU COULD BE
IN DANGER TOO.

16:01.458 --> 16:02.834
THAT'S WHY YOU ND TO KNOW.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.417
THAT'S WHY WE'RE MEETING HERE
AND WHY--

16:04.417 --> 16:06.583
- DEX.
- BUT I'M GONNA HANDLE THIS.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.125
- WHY IS HE AFTER YOU?

16:08.125 --> 16:09.458
- [sighs]

16:09.458 --> 16:12.667
VIKTOR BASKOV.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.500
- VIKTOR BASKOV DISAPPEARED.

16:18.417 --> 16:20.291
YOU KILLED HIM.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.667
- HE KILLED MIKE ANDERSON.

16:22.667 --> 16:25.375
- WHAT ABOUT THE GUY
THAT SAID HE KILLED MIKE--

16:25.375 --> 16:28.000
THE--THE BARTENDER THAT BLEW
HIS FUCKING BRAINS OUT?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.375
- SOMEONE PUT HIM UP TO IT--
ISAAK PROBABLY--

16:30.375 --> 16:32.917
SO THAT YOU WOULD CLOSE THE CASE
AND MOVE ON.

16:32.917 --> 16:35.583
- THIS IS UN-FUCKING REAL.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.625
- VIKTOR BASKOV WAS ON HIS WAY
BACK TO KIEV.

16:37.625 --> 16:38.959
I HAD TO KILL HIM.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.750
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.083
THERE WASN'T--
- TIME? YOU DIDN'T--

16:42.083 --> 16:43.500
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TIME
TO MAKE A PHONE CALL

16:43.500 --> 16:44.959
SO THAT I COULD--I DON'T KNOW--
FUCKING ARREST HIM

16:44.959 --> 16:46.792
OR SOMETHING?
- HIS FLIGHT WAS LEAVING.

16:46.792 --> 16:48.000
- HIS--

16:48.000 --> 16:52.750
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE KILLED MIKE?

16:52.750 --> 16:55.125
- I FOUND HIS FINGERPRINT
AT THE SCENE.

16:57.458 --> 17:00.417
- AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

17:00.417 --> 17:03.125
YOU KEPT IT
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?

17:06.333 --> 17:08.959
DEX, SO WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
ONLY TAKING CARE

17:08.959 --> 17:10.792
OF PEOPLE THAT SLIP
THROUGH THE CRACKS

17:10.792 --> 17:12.250
OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM?

17:12.250 --> 17:14.333
YOU CAN'T RIP A CASE WIDE OPEN

17:14.333 --> 17:17.000
SO THAT IT CONVENIENTLY FALLS
INTO YOUR FUCKING LAP!

17:17.000 --> 17:18.166
- I KNOW.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.834
- OBVIOUSLY
YOU DON'T KNOW, DEXTER,

17:19.834 --> 17:22.667
BECAUSE THIS IS NORMAL
FOR YOU.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.125
BUT TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT
FUCKING NORMAL FOR ME,

17:25.125 --> 17:26.375
NOT AT ALL.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.417
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
MY FUCKING JOB?

17:28.417 --> 17:30.917
WHICH AT THIS POINT IS THE
BE-ALL, END-ALL OF HYPOCRISY,

17:30.917 --> 17:33.125
BECAUSE I AM THE LIEUTENANT
OF FUCKING HOMICIDE,

17:33.125 --> 17:36.875
AND I HAVE ALREADY HELPED YOU
COVER UP TWO MURDERS.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.625
THREE--
THIS MAKES THREE.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.250
AND THE FUCKING BARTENDER--
OH, MY FUCKING GOD.

17:41.250 --> 17:43.834
OH, MY GOD.

17:43.834 --> 17:47.834
HOW DID THIS BECOME MY LIFE?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.041
- DEB, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M GONNA ARREST ISAAK!

17:50.041 --> 17:51.834
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM
TO FUCKING JAIL.

17:51.834 --> 17:53.542
- ON WHAT CHARGE?
- I'LL FIND SOMETHING!

17:53.542 --> 17:55.083
- NO!
WE CAN'T--

17:55.083 --> 17:59.208
I CAN'T AFFORD TO RISK HIM
TALKING.

18:00.750 --> 18:03.667
LOOK, I WILL HANDLE THIS,
BUT UNTIL I DO,

18:03.667 --> 18:06.333
WE NEED TO TAKE
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS.

18:06.333 --> 18:10.250
ISAAK IS CONVINCED THAT
THERE'S SOME POLICE CONSPIRACY.

18:10.250 --> 18:15.041
HE THINKS WE ALL KILLED VIKTOR,
SO YOU'RE AT RISK TOO.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.083
- WHAT?

18:16.083 --> 18:19.166
- BUT I CAN KEEP YOU SAFE.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.041
WE'RE GONNA GO TO A HOTEL...
- [scoffs]

18:21.041 --> 18:23.417
- A PLACE WHERE NO ONE KNOWS
WHO WE ARE,

18:23.417 --> 18:25.542
WHERE NO ONE
ASKS ANY QUESTIONS,

18:25.542 --> 18:27.375
A PLACE WHERE
WE'LL BOTH BE SAFE.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.417
- THIS IS FUCKING FANTASTIC.

18:29.417 --> 18:33.250
HE MIGHT BE WATCHING
THE PRECINCT, YOUR HOME.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.458
I NEED YOU TO TAKE A CAR
FROM THE MOTOR POOL,

18:35.458 --> 18:37.667
MAKE SURE YOU NEVER LEAVE
THE SAME WAY TWICE.

18:37.667 --> 18:41.083
MAKE SURE NO ONE FOLLOWS YOU.
I'LL DO THE SAME.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.959
- I NEED YOU
TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.000
- WHAT?

18:45.000 --> 18:48.625
- THAT YOU WILL NEVER TAKE
A CASE

18:48.625 --> 18:52.083
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
AGAIN, FROM ME, EVER.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.500
- OKAY.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.750
- ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

18:56.750 --> 18:58.458
- I DON'T THINK SO.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.583
- YOU DON'T THINK SO?
YOU DON'T FUCKING THINK SO?

19:00.583 --> 19:04.083
- I'M NOT LYING.

19:04.083 --> 19:07.250
- I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING,
DO I?

19:19.083 --> 19:22.083
- WHEN YOU BEGIN A STALK,
YOU START WITH WHAT YOU KNOW.

19:22.083 --> 19:25.250
AND WITH ISAAK,
THAT ISN'T MUCH.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.834
ISAAK ISN'T JUST SOME HIT MAN.

19:46.834 --> 19:48.291
HE'S A BOSS.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.834
[cell phone rings,
engine turning]

19:57.834 --> 19:59.500
DAMN.
[car departing]

19:59.500 --> 20:00.542
YES?

20:00.542 --> 20:03.875
- DEXTER, HANNAH MCKAY
IS ON HER WAY IN.

20:03.875 --> 20:06.500
- I'M KIND OF TIED UP
WITH SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.750
- DEXTER,
HANNAH IS GONNA TALK US

20:08.750 --> 20:10.625
THROUGH HER ROAD TRIP
WITH WAYNE RANDALL

20:10.625 --> 20:12.542
AND HELP US FIND THE REST
OF THE BODIES.

20:12.542 --> 20:14.959
THIS IS IMPORTANT.
GET HERE NOW.

20:14.959 --> 20:19.208
- RIGHT.
I'M ON MY WAY.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.959
[cell phone thuds]

20:20.959 --> 20:22.709
[engine turning]

20:25.875 --> 20:27.333
- IN THAT FIRST WEEK,

20:27.333 --> 20:29.333
WAYNE SHOT
A GAS STATION ATTENDANT

20:29.333 --> 20:31.208
IN ASHFORD, ALABAMA.

20:31.208 --> 20:34.083
- THAT'S WHERE THESE ARE FROM.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.208
- AND WAYNE SHOT
ANOTHER ATTENDANT

20:37.208 --> 20:40.250
IN LAKE CITY, FLORIDA.

20:47.417 --> 20:51.083
AND THEN HE SHOT A GUY
OUTSIDE OF SARASOTA

20:51.083 --> 20:54.041
WHO STOPPED TO HELP YOU
FIX A FLAT.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.375
[pen clicks]

20:57.375 --> 20:59.250
YOU THEN GET PICKED UP
IN MIAMI

20:59.250 --> 21:02.417
TRYING TO SNEAK ON BOARD
A CRUISE SHIP.

21:02.417 --> 21:05.542
THAT WEEK YOU GUYS WERE
IN MIAMI--

21:05.542 --> 21:08.500
THAT'S THE STORY
WE DON'T KNOW...

21:08.500 --> 21:10.083
THE PEOPLE WAYNE KILLED,

21:10.083 --> 21:12.959
THE BODIES WE'D LIKE TO FIND.

21:12.959 --> 21:16.500
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT STARTS HERE.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.417
- UH...

21:18.417 --> 21:20.166
UH, WE GOT TO MIAMI,

21:20.166 --> 21:23.500
AND WE WERE THE ONLY THING
ON THE NEWS.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.208
WE WERE DESPERATE--
NO MONEY,

21:25.208 --> 21:27.542
COPS EVERYWHERE.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.667
WAYNE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD
HIDE OUT IN THE MOTELS

21:29.667 --> 21:33.458
UNTIL WE COULD MAKE IT
TO THAT CRUISE SHIP.

21:36.208 --> 21:41.041
HE KILLED PEOPLE
SO WE COULD TAKE THEIR ROOMS.

21:41.041 --> 21:44.709
WE BURIED THE BODIES
CLOSE TO THE MOTELS.

21:44.709 --> 21:46.166
- WHERE WERE THE MOTELS?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.875
- ONE WAS BY A FROSTY SWIRL--

21:47.875 --> 21:50.375
UH, WAYNE'S FAVORITE.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.917
- THAT'S WHERE MISS DUBOIS
WAS FOUND.

21:51.917 --> 21:53.917
WHAT ABOUT THESE?

21:53.917 --> 21:55.667
- THOSE TWO GO TOGETHER.

21:55.667 --> 21:56.959
- TOGETHER?

21:56.959 --> 21:59.125
- THEY WERE A COUPLE--

21:59.125 --> 22:02.041
HUSBAND AND WIFE,
I GUESS.

22:02.041 --> 22:05.583
- WHERE ARE THEY BURIED?
- CLOSE TO ONE OF THE PORTS.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.792
I REMEMBER
BIG SHIPS UNLOADING.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.750
- AND THE MOTEL?

22:09.750 --> 22:11.792
- SMALL...

22:11.792 --> 22:13.458
UM, ONE-STORY--

22:13.458 --> 22:14.667
I THINK I WOULD RECOGNIZE IT,

22:14.667 --> 22:18.500
BUT SO MUCH OF THAT TIME
IS JUST A BLUR, YOU KNOW?

22:20.667 --> 22:23.875
EVERYTHING CHANGED IN MIAMI--
WAYNE, MOST OF ALL.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.875
I WAS SO SCARED.

22:25.875 --> 22:29.792
I THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

22:29.792 --> 22:31.166
HE FORCED ME TO HELP HIM
DIG THOSE HOLES,

22:31.166 --> 22:33.500
AND EVERY TIME
THAT I DUG ONE OF THEM,

22:33.500 --> 22:37.333
I-I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS DIGGING
MY OWN GRAVE OR NOT.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.375
- I UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFICULT
THIS IS FOR YOU,

22:39.375 --> 22:41.041
BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

22:41.041 --> 22:44.000
I'M GONNA GET THE BALL ROLLING
ON THE NEXT DIG--

22:44.000 --> 22:46.375
TOMORROW IF POSSIBLE.

22:46.375 --> 22:49.625
- SURE. I'D LIKE TO GET
THIS OVER WITH.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.250
[toy creaking]

23:04.250 --> 23:07.458
- THAT TOY ISN'T BRINGING BACK
MEMORIES OF BEING SCARED.

23:07.458 --> 23:09.542
SHE'S NOSTALGIC.

23:09.542 --> 23:12.083
NO TOUCHING.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.875
CAN I HAVE
YOUR GIRAFFE BACK, PLEASE?

23:18.875 --> 23:22.375
- IT'S WAYNE'S...

23:22.375 --> 23:24.750
WAYNE'S GIRAFFE.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.041
- IT WAS WRAPPED
IN YOUR SHIRT.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.917
- WHAT, ARE YOU
A DETECTIVE NOW TOO?

23:36.875 --> 23:41.959
- SERGEANT BATISTA WILL GIVE YOU
THE DETAILS FOR TOMORROW.

23:41.959 --> 23:43.792
- WILL YOU BE THERE?

23:46.417 --> 23:49.125
- I HOPE SO.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.208
[sighs]

23:57.208 --> 24:02.125
KILLING ISAAK WOULD MAKE
A LOT OF KOSHKAS VERY ANGRY...

24:06.250 --> 24:08.667
BUT A LOT OF COLOMBIANS
VERY HAPPY.

24:08.667 --> 24:10.917
- THE GODDAMN SHOWER
HAS TWO SETTINGS--

24:10.917 --> 24:13.125
SCALDING AND FREEZING.

24:13.125 --> 24:17.041
- IT'S A CHEAP MOTEL.
THAT'S THE POINT.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.750
- I'M NOT DOING THIS
ANOTHER NIGHT.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.458
- HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO.

24:22.458 --> 24:25.959
- DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE WORKING
ON A SOLUTION?

24:25.959 --> 24:28.750
- I HAVE A PLAN, YES.

24:28.750 --> 24:33.125
- DOES IT INVOLVE YOU
KILLING SOMEONE?

24:33.125 --> 24:36.000
- I'M NOT KILLING ANYBODY.

24:39.125 --> 24:40.959
THAT'S MY BED...

24:40.959 --> 24:44.000
CLOSEST TO THE DOOR.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.875
- TELL ME YOUR PLAN.

24:54.875 --> 24:56.709
- NO.

24:56.709 --> 24:59.083
- DEXTER, I'M HIDING OUT
IN THIS FUCKING MOTEL ROOM.

24:59.083 --> 25:01.250
I'M A PART OF THIS.

25:01.250 --> 25:05.625
- NOT ANY MORE
THAN YOU NEED TO BE.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.041
- [sighs]

25:12.250 --> 25:16.250
THIS IS NOT HOW I EVER IMAGINED
SPENDING TONIGHT.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.000
- WE'VE STAYED
IN HOTEL ROOMS BEFORE.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.208
- YEAH, WHEN WE WENT
TO MYRTLE BEACH

25:24.208 --> 25:25.959
TO VISIT MOM'S SISTER.

25:28.333 --> 25:32.041
- THERE WERE SEA SHELLS EMBEDDED
IN THE PLASTER ON THE WALLS...

25:33.792 --> 25:38.000
NO AIR-CONDITIONING,
JUST CEILING FANS.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.792
- THERE WAS SAND
FROM THE BEACH EVERYWHERE,

25:40.792 --> 25:43.458
EVEN IN THE BEDS.

25:46.333 --> 25:49.375
YOU KEPT YOUR EYES ON ME
ALL DAY.

25:51.333 --> 25:55.667
- I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO DROWN.

25:59.083 --> 26:02.208
- YOU WERE MY HERO.

26:11.125 --> 26:13.375
- GOOD BOY.
GOOD.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.792
- HOT AS HELL OUT HERE...

26:19.792 --> 26:22.041
EVEN WITH THE OCEAN BREEZE.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.000
- [sighs]
- THINK WE'LL FI ANYTHING?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.500
[dog barks]

26:26.500 --> 26:29.417
- THE MOTEL HANNAH AND WAYNE
STAYED AT IS STILL HERE.

26:29.417 --> 26:31.875
NOTHING'S CHANGED MUCH...

26:31.875 --> 26:34.250
SINCE THEIR SPREE.

26:34.250 --> 26:37.542
PRETTY GOOD ODDS.
- HMM.

26:40.959 --> 26:43.750
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

26:45.834 --> 26:48.792
THIS BARTENDER
WHO SHOT HIMSELF--

26:48.792 --> 26:50.709
ALEX DUBROZNY...

26:53.250 --> 26:55.083
DO YOU THINK IT'S A SUICIDE?

26:55.083 --> 26:59.375
- MASUKA MATCHED HIS HANDWRITING
TO THE NOTE HE LEFT.

26:59.375 --> 27:02.250
HIS FINGERPRINTS WERE
ON THE GUN, GSR ON THE HAND.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.750
HE DEFINITELY PULLED
THE TRIGGER.

27:04.750 --> 27:06.709
- [exhales deeply]

27:06.709 --> 27:10.750
OW.
FUCKING BUGS.

27:10.750 --> 27:13.041
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME SPRAY
FROM THE CAR.

27:13.041 --> 27:16.250
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

27:18.959 --> 27:22.291
- THIS PART OF THE JOB...

27:22.291 --> 27:24.041
STAND AROUND AND STARE?

27:24.041 --> 27:28.291
- I'M NOT NEEDED UNLESS
THERE'S A BODY OR BLOOD.

27:28.291 --> 27:31.458
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.083
FIRST TIME WAYNE KILLED
SOMEBODY,

27:33.083 --> 27:37.291
HE SHOT HIM
RIGHT IN THE CHEST, AND I...

27:37.291 --> 27:38.959
COULDN'T MOVE.

27:38.959 --> 27:42.125
I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT MUCH BLOOD
IN MY LIFE.

27:42.125 --> 27:45.041
[indistinct chatter continues]

27:45.041 --> 27:46.834
- FIRST CRIME SCENE
I EVER WORKED,

27:46.834 --> 27:51.709
A WOMAN STABBED HER HUSBAND
AFTER FIXING HIM A SANDWICH.

27:51.709 --> 27:54.500
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,
HE LOOKED LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP,

27:54.500 --> 27:56.542
JUST FLOATING ON A SEA OF RED

27:56.542 --> 28:01.125
AND THE SANDWICH NEXT
TO HIS HEAD.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.875
SEEMED SO SAD THAT NO ONE
WAS GONNA EAT IT.

28:05.959 --> 28:07.500
- LOOK AT US
TALKING BLOOD AND GORE

28:07.500 --> 28:08.709
LIKE WE'RE ON A DATE,

28:08.709 --> 28:11.125
SHARING OUR
FIRST SEXUAL EXPERIENCE.

28:11.125 --> 28:14.959
[dog barking]

28:14.959 --> 28:17.333
- I'VE GOT WORK TO DO.

28:25.625 --> 28:27.500
- THERE YOU ARE.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.709
- AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
TALKING TO THE CONNORS?

28:29.709 --> 28:31.458
- THEY WERE LESS
THAN COOPERATIVE.

28:31.458 --> 28:33.291
THIS WAS ON MY WAY BACK
TO THE STATION,

28:33.291 --> 28:35.208
SO I THOUGHT I'D SIT IN.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.166
- GREAT.

28:37.166 --> 28:40.834
[doorbell rings]

28:43.208 --> 28:44.291
- HI.

28:44.291 --> 28:47.208
I'M CAPTAIN MARIA LAGUERTA,
MIAMI METRO,

28:47.208 --> 28:48.709
AND THIS IS
LIEUTENANT DEBRA MORGAN.

28:48.709 --> 28:50.875
- I TALKED TO YOUR MOM,
PATRICIA. IS SHE HOME?

28:50.875 --> 28:52.917
- NO, UH, SORRY.
SHE GOT CALLED INTO WORK.

28:52.917 --> 28:54.750
- OH, THAT--
WE'LL COME BACK.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.583
- IS THIS ABOUT MY DAD?

28:56.583 --> 28:58.250
SHE SAID YOU GUYS HAD CALLED.

28:58.250 --> 29:01.083
I COULD TRY TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT.

29:01.083 --> 29:04.000
- THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.208
- YEAH.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.792
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR FATHER?

29:15.792 --> 29:18.583
- MAY 19, 2007--

29:18.583 --> 29:20.750
THE BEST FUCKING DAY
OF MY LIFE.

29:20.750 --> 29:22.875
- HOW SO?

29:22.875 --> 29:26.792
- 'CAUSE HE NEVER CAME BACK.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.583
- SO WASN'T IT HARD GROWING UP
WITHOUT A FATHER?

29:29.583 --> 29:30.959
- IT WAS A HELL
OF A LOT BETTER

29:30.959 --> 29:33.291
THAN GROWING UP WITH A FATHER
WHO BEAT ME AND MY MOM

29:33.291 --> 29:35.166
EVERY CHANCE HE GOT.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.000
- I'M SORRY.

29:37.000 --> 29:39.709
- THEN ONE NIGHT,
HE DIDN'T COME HOME.

29:39.709 --> 29:41.750
I SWEAR,
EVERYTHING GOT BETTER.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.417
MY MOM WASN'T CRYING
ALL THE TIME,

29:44.417 --> 29:47.709
AND I WASN'T CONSTANTLY LOOKING
OVER MY SHOULDER.

29:47.709 --> 29:48.875
- TY, YOU MENTIONED
THE LAST TIME

29:48.875 --> 29:52.083
YOU SAW YOUR FATHER--
HE WAS WORKING A WEDDING?

29:52.083 --> 29:53.917
- YEAH, UH,
MY MOM PRINTED OUT

29:53.917 --> 29:55.542
SOME PICTURES FOR YOU
FROM THAT NIGHT.

29:55.542 --> 29:57.250
SHE--SHE THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT WANT THEM.

29:57.250 --> 29:59.250
- GREAT.

30:00.834 --> 30:04.166
- WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO FIND
IN THESE PICTURES?

30:04.166 --> 30:06.000
- SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY
HAD THIS THEORY

30:06.000 --> 30:08.583
THAT THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER
WAS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

30:08.583 --> 30:11.000
IF BARNES WAS KILLED
BY THE BUTCHER...

30:11.000 --> 30:12.792
- THEN HIS FACE MIGHT BE
IN ONE OF THE PICTURES.

30:12.792 --> 30:15.291
- WE MIGHT EVEN KNOW HIM...
OR HER.

30:15.291 --> 30:16.750
[footsteps approaching]

30:19.542 --> 30:21.917
YOU MIND?
- YEAH. NO.

30:27.375 --> 30:29.083
- OKAY.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.667
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR EXACTLY?

30:35.667 --> 30:36.834
- WE THINK YOUR FATHER

30:36.834 --> 30:39.667
MAY HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED
AND MURDERED

30:39.667 --> 30:41.000
THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED,

30:41.000 --> 30:45.709
AND THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE
COULD BE IN THESE PICTURES.

30:45.709 --> 30:48.834
- MOM WOULD FINALLY KNOW
HE'S NOT COMING HOME.

30:48.834 --> 30:51.250
- THIS IS A BIG WEDDING--
A LOT OF PICTURES.

30:51.250 --> 30:55.166
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE
THESE BACK TO THE STATION

30:55.166 --> 30:58.333
AND SPEND THE DAY
GOING OVER THEM.

31:00.834 --> 31:03.083
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:03.083 --> 31:05.291
WE SHOULDN'T RUSH THIS.

31:05.291 --> 31:07.792
THANK YOU, TY.
THANKS.

31:09.792 --> 31:12.792
- RIGHT HERE--
PUT IT DOWN.

31:12.792 --> 31:15.792
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

31:18.417 --> 31:22.458
GO AHEAD, DETECTIVE.

31:22.458 --> 31:27.291
[indistinct chatter continues]

31:27.291 --> 31:28.625
- [chuckles]

31:28.625 --> 31:29.792
"TILL DEATH DO US PART"

31:29.792 --> 31:31.375
DIDN'T QUITE WORK OUT
FOR THESE GUYS.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.583
[laughs]
GET IT?

31:33.583 --> 31:36.750
'CAUSE THEY'RE DEAD,
BUT THEY'RE STILL TOGETHER?

31:36.750 --> 31:38.375
OKAY, MOVING ON.

31:38.375 --> 31:40.542
- THE SHOWER CURTAIN
HELPED PRESERVE

31:40.542 --> 31:42.709
THE BODIES AND THE CLOTHES.

31:42.709 --> 31:45.041
- OUR LUCKY DAY.

31:51.667 --> 31:54.917
- IT'S A SAFE ASSUMPTION
THAT WAYNE STARTED

31:54.917 --> 31:56.166
WITH THE MALE.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.208
IT WOULD'VE BEEN IMPORTANT
TO IMMOBILIZE HIM FIRST,

31:59.208 --> 32:03.667
'CAUSE HE PRESENTED
THE BIGGEST THREAT.

32:03.667 --> 32:06.041
THERE ARE DEFENSIVE WOUNDS
ON THE ARMS AND THE HANDS.

32:06.041 --> 32:07.083
HE PUT UP A FIGHT.

32:07.083 --> 32:10.041
JUDGING FROM THE CUTS
IN THE FABRIC,

32:10.041 --> 32:13.417
WE'RE LOOKING AT PERHAPS
A SIX-INCH KNIFE.

32:13.417 --> 32:16.625
NUMEROUS SHALLOW WOUNDS

32:16.625 --> 32:20.000
UNTIL WAYNE WAS ABLE
TO INFLICT THIS--

32:20.000 --> 32:22.834
THE FATAL WOUND.

32:22.834 --> 32:26.083
ONCE HE WAS DONE WITH HIM,

32:26.083 --> 32:30.041
HE MOVED ON
TO THE FEMALE VICTIM.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.041
STABBED NUMEROUS TIMES.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.917
THE SPATTER PATTERN

32:35.917 --> 32:39.959
SUGGESTS
THE VICTIM FELL ON HER BACK.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.709
AND THESE VOIDS HERE
LIKELY INDICATE

32:42.709 --> 32:46.375
THAT SHE WAS STRADDLED
BY HER ASSAILANT...

32:46.375 --> 32:49.959
WHO WAS MUCH SMALLER
THAN WAYNE.

32:49.959 --> 32:51.792
IF WAYNE DIDN'T KILL
THIS PERSON...

32:51.792 --> 32:54.917
[indistinct chatter continues]

32:57.375 --> 32:59.458
- DEXTER...

32:59.458 --> 33:02.959
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

33:02.959 --> 33:05.417
- I'M NOT SURE.
IT COULD MEAN A LOT OF THINGS.

33:05.417 --> 33:08.959
I WON'T KNOW UNTIL I GET BACK
TO THE LAB AND RUN SOME TESTS.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.083
I GUESS WE'RE DONE HERE.

33:26.250 --> 33:29.000
- WHY'D YOU STOP?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.291
- STOP WHAT?

33:30.291 --> 33:33.208
- YOU STARTED TO DESCRIBE
HOW WAYNE KILLED THAT GIRL.

33:33.208 --> 33:37.333
AND YOU GOT HALFWAY THROUGH,
AND THEN YOU STOPPED.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.291
- I DID.

33:39.291 --> 33:41.667
- AND THEN YOU LOOKED
RIGHT AT ME.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.291
- I DID.

33:43.291 --> 33:46.834
- WHY?

33:46.834 --> 33:48.500
- THE SPATTER TOLD ME A STORY

33:48.500 --> 33:51.959
THAT CONFLICTS
WHAT YOU SAY HAPPENED.

33:51.959 --> 33:54.125
- REALLY?

33:54.125 --> 33:56.125
HOW SO?

33:59.166 --> 34:02.041
- HOW'D YOU GET THIS?

34:02.041 --> 34:07.000
- IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING I GOT
FOR TALKING BACK TO WAYNE.

34:08.166 --> 34:10.417
HE GOT ANGRY
AND SLASHED AT ME.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.041
- BULLSHIT.

34:12.041 --> 34:14.458
- DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
THAT I DON'T?

34:14.458 --> 34:17.208
- WAYNE DIDN'T KILL
THAT WOMAN.

34:17.208 --> 34:20.750
HE WAS TOO BUSY WITH THE MALE.
IT WAS SOMEONE SMALLER--

34:20.750 --> 34:23.542
SOMEONE
WITH A DIFFERENT KNIFE

34:23.542 --> 34:25.709
WHO WAS...

34:25.709 --> 34:28.083
INEXPERIENCED...

34:28.083 --> 34:31.750
GOT CARRIED AWAY
WITH THE FRENZY OF THE MOMENT,

34:31.750 --> 34:33.542
STABBED THE WOMAN OVER
AND OVER

34:33.542 --> 34:34.875
UNTIL THE KNIFE GOT SO BLOODY,

34:34.875 --> 34:38.542
HER HAND SLIPPED ALONG
THE EDGE OF THE SHARP BLADE,

34:38.542 --> 34:42.792
CUTTING HER PALM VERY DEEPLY,
EXACTLY LIKE YOURS,

34:42.792 --> 34:47.417
LEAVING A PASSIVE SPATTER STAIN
ON THE VICTIM'S DRESS.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.083
EVERYTHING YOU SAID
IS A LIE.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.583
- THAT'S MY STORY...

34:57.583 --> 35:00.166
AND I'M STICKING TO IT.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.625
- AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

35:06.208 --> 35:07.750
YOU HAVE IMMUNITY,
DON'T YOU?

35:07.750 --> 35:11.875
THE D.A. GAVE YOU IMMUNITY
FOR COOPERATING WITH US.

35:11.875 --> 35:15.542
- FROM ANY CRIME COMMITTED
WITH WAYNE, YEAH.

35:15.542 --> 35:17.500
YEAH.

35:17.500 --> 35:22.250
A GIRL'S GOT
TO PROTECT HERSELF.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.875
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND,
DEXTER MORGAN.

35:29.083 --> 35:32.125
- [exhales deeply]

35:44.917 --> 35:48.500
- ISAAK...
I KNEW YOU'D SHOW UP EVENTUALLY.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.333
[engine turning]

36:01.792 --> 36:05.750
[engine revs]

36:19.000 --> 36:23.041
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA LOSE YOU.

36:57.625 --> 37:01.667
WELCOME TO THE WRONG SIDE
OF TOWN, ISAAK.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.542
NOT USED TO STRANGERS HERE.

37:11.542 --> 37:13.250
KOSHKAS.

37:13.250 --> 37:15.709
AND CERTAINLY NOT USED
TO THEIR SWORN ENEMIES

37:15.709 --> 37:18.000
WALKING IN.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.959
BUT ISAAK,
BEING FROM OUT OF TOWN,

37:20.959 --> 37:24.083
WON'T KNOW ANY OF THIS.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.792
- [speaking Spanish]

37:48.375 --> 37:50.750
- [speaking Spanish]

37:55.792 --> 37:58.166
- DEFINITELY NOT
AS MUCH FUN

37:58.166 --> 38:01.291
AS PUTTING ISAAK
ON MY TABLE...

38:01.291 --> 38:04.375
BUT IT DOES MASK HIS DEATH
AS THE RESULTING WAR

38:04.375 --> 38:06.542
BETWEEN RIVAL HEROIN DEALERS.

38:10.083 --> 38:13.417
- WHO'S SAVING WHOSE ASS NOW?

38:24.125 --> 38:25.834
[knock at door]

38:25.834 --> 38:28.041
- WHAT'S UP?
- I KNOW YOU'RE BUSY.

38:28.041 --> 38:29.250
AND ALSO WANT YOU TO KNOW

38:29.250 --> 38:30.875
THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO STIR UP
ANY SHIT.

38:30.875 --> 38:33.417
- OF COURSE NOT.

38:33.417 --> 38:36.917
- IT'S ABOUT
THIS ALEX DUBROZNY SUICIDE.

38:42.083 --> 38:43.959
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS GUY

38:43.959 --> 38:45.792
BEING ANDERSON'S KILLER
THAT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.

38:45.792 --> 38:47.875
[cell phone rings]

38:47.875 --> 38:49.959

- I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE.

52:52.875 --> 52:54.625
- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP.

52:54.625 --> 52:56.208
- [sighs]

52:56.208 --> 53:00.333
- BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT IT.

53:00.333 --> 53:02.500
- OKAY.

53:04.166 --> 53:07.291
- I HAD TO LIE TO BATISTA...

53:07.291 --> 53:11.875
[voice breaking]
BATISTA FOR YOU.

53:11.875 --> 53:13.917
AND THAT WAS THE MOMENT
THAT I REALIZED

53:13.917 --> 53:16.375
THAT I DON'T WANT TO BE
A PART OF THIS.

53:16.375 --> 53:18.333
I CAN'T DO IT.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.875
IT TOOK ME FOREVER
TO WRAP MY BRAIN

53:22.875 --> 53:25.166
AROUND THE IDEA THAT...

53:25.166 --> 53:27.792
YOU'RE NOT
WHO I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

53:30.166 --> 53:32.333
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO CHANGE.

53:36.208 --> 53:38.125
ALL OF YOUR STEALING
AND YOUR LYING

53:38.125 --> 53:41.291
AND YOUR COVERING UP...

53:41.291 --> 53:44.375
THAT'S NOT ME.

53:52.875 --> 53:55.917
- SO YOU THINK LAGUERTA'S
INVESTIGATION IS...

53:55.917 --> 53:58.208
CLOSED?

53:58.208 --> 54:00.750
- [sighs]

54:03.166 --> 54:05.500
NO.

54:05.500 --> 54:09.208
- LUNDY COULDN'T FIGURE ME OUT.

54:09.208 --> 54:13.000
NO REASON TO THINK
LAGUERTA WILL.

54:18.834 --> 54:20.250
[bottles clinking]

54:20.250 --> 54:22.583
- OH, IF LUNDY
COULD SEE ME NOW...

54:22.583 --> 54:26.583
[chuckles]

54:26.583 --> 54:28.583
AND YOU.

54:37.792 --> 54:39.792
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT OUR VACATION

54:39.792 --> 54:42.542
TO MYRTLE BEACH A LOT...

54:42.542 --> 54:44.750
HOW WE SPENT OUR DAYS.

54:44.750 --> 54:48.083
- ON THE BEACH.

54:48.083 --> 54:51.417
- RUNNING UP AND DOWN
THE SHORE...

54:51.417 --> 54:53.458
AND AT LOW TIDE,
RUNNING IN AND OUT OF THE WATER.

54:53.458 --> 54:57.792
I WAS ALWAYS CHASING YOU.
I COULD NEVER CATCH YOU.

54:57.792 --> 55:00.750
- YOU WOULDN'T TAKE OFF
YOUR FLIPPERS.

55:00.750 --> 55:02.792
[chuckles]

55:05.333 --> 55:08.041
- EVEN IF I DID,
YOU WERE ALWAYS...

55:08.041 --> 55:09.583
[clicks tongue]

55:09.583 --> 55:12.250
JUST OUT OF REACH.

55:14.041 --> 55:17.834
- MAYBE WE'RE LEARNING
IT'S BETTER THAT WAY.

55:23.667 --> 55:26.125
- DID YOU GET
THE BLOOD REPORT BACK

55:26.125 --> 55:28.792
ON THE BODIES FROM THE DIG?

55:28.792 --> 55:32.125
- YEAH.

55:32.125 --> 55:35.041
- AND?

55:35.041 --> 55:37.500
ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW?

55:40.458 --> 55:43.500
- NOPE.

55:51.834 --> 55:54.125
[sighs]

55:56.083 --> 55:58.542
[drawer opens]

56:08.834 --> 56:13.291
AS KIDS, DEB AND I WOULD TRY
TO OUTRUN THE WAVES,

56:13.291 --> 56:15.959
BUT I WOULD ALWAYS END UP
DIVING UNDER THEM.

56:15.959 --> 56:17.667
I'D SWIM DEEP

56:17.667 --> 56:21.917
BECAUSE I COULD WITHSTAND
THE PULL OF THE TIDE.

56:29.375 --> 56:34.000
BUT DEB WAS ALWAYS SAFEST
AT SHORE.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.166
FROM HERE ON OUT, I'LL FACE
THE DEPTHS BY MYSELF.
