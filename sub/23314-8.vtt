WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.294
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:01.296 --> 00:03.655
Anissa came by with a
box of Alvin's research.

00:03.657 --> 00:05.256
I didn't have a chance
to look through it,

00:05.258 --> 00:08.351
but I did come across some pretty
advanced biochemical formulas.

00:08.354 --> 00:10.794
Dr. Lynn Stewart is highly capable.

00:10.797 --> 00:13.464
And she's been doing
research that's off-limits.

00:13.466 --> 00:16.200
It's either her or you.
You understand that?

00:16.202 --> 00:18.770
If I kill Lady Eve without
the Shadow Board's permission,

00:18.772 --> 00:20.872
I might as well bury myself with her.

00:20.874 --> 00:22.473
Not necessarily.

00:22.475 --> 00:25.546
Evelyn Stillwater-Ferguson
was killed by electrocution,

00:25.549 --> 00:28.016
making Black Lightning
their prime suspect.

00:28.019 --> 00:29.652
Latavious, that is enough!

00:29.655 --> 00:31.648
You know my damn name!

00:39.294 --> 00:42.195
Do you believe in the
Resurrection, Latavious?

00:49.505 --> 00:51.356
Anissa?

00:51.359 --> 00:53.343
You can't afford to lose your head.

00:53.346 --> 00:54.572
That's when people get hurt.

00:54.575 --> 00:57.142
Then train me. Show me how to do this.

00:57.145 --> 00:58.183
You're clearly not ready.

00:58.186 --> 01:01.080
Eventually, she will go back out
there, whether we like it or not.

01:01.082 --> 01:03.109
Training her is the right thing to do.

01:04.992 --> 01:06.352
And our search for Black Lightning

01:06.354 --> 01:08.586
has expanded to include
another five officers.

01:08.589 --> 01:11.921
Freeland PD won't rest until Lady
Eve's murderer is brought to justice.

01:11.924 --> 01:14.293
She was a good woman, did a lot for us.

01:14.295 --> 01:15.928
I told people when Black
Lightning came back,

01:15.930 --> 01:18.331
all he's doing is beating
up on young black men.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.343
Now he's out here killing black women?

01:20.346 --> 01:22.609
What's next? Little kids and babies?

01:23.848 --> 01:25.438
Why you think he
hiding behind that mask?

01:25.440 --> 01:26.839
'Cause he know he trippin', man.

01:26.841 --> 01:29.070
Like, I understand
fighting The Hundred...

01:29.931 --> 01:31.464
but Lady Eve?

01:31.467 --> 01:32.666
That's wrong, man.

01:32.669 --> 01:34.013
I got you, old man.

01:35.950 --> 01:37.171
Yeah.

01:37.174 --> 01:38.373
Urban mix.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:54.226 --> 01:56.302
I don't see him as no damn hero.

01:56.304 --> 01:58.938
He's worse than these
crooked-ass police in Freeland.

02:00.975 --> 02:03.342
I feel like wherever he
was before he came back,

02:03.344 --> 02:04.710
that's where he should've stayed.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.517
Freeze.

02:11.519 --> 02:12.852
Freeze?

02:14.914 --> 02:17.857
He might be racist,
but he wasn't a threat.

02:17.859 --> 02:21.109
And you probably broke his ankle
and maybe gave him a concussion.

02:21.112 --> 02:22.295
The flag on the T-shirt.

02:22.297 --> 02:23.563
No, I know why it happened.

02:23.565 --> 02:25.570
You looked and you
assumed he was a threat,

02:25.573 --> 02:27.934
so you didn't actually
see that he wasn't.

02:30.695 --> 02:34.173
Look, our goal is to
stop crime and violence

02:34.175 --> 02:38.309
with no harm to civilians, even if...

02:38.312 --> 02:41.013
we don't appreciate their worldview.

02:41.016 --> 02:42.115
You...

02:46.570 --> 02:50.105
You can't be reactive,

02:50.108 --> 02:52.976
going around smashing
whatever statues you feel like.

02:52.979 --> 02:54.678
Picking fights with punks from Garfield.

02:54.681 --> 02:56.875
No. You have to be in control.

02:56.878 --> 02:57.984
Every minute.

02:57.987 --> 02:59.921
I'm not perfect, nobody is.

03:03.517 --> 03:04.783
All right, you ready?

03:04.785 --> 03:06.218
Brace yourself.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.252
Hold your breath.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.456
This attempt at framing
me, you know what it proves?

03:11.458 --> 03:12.824
I'm getting under someone's skin.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.960
I'm guessing it's about Green Light.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.094
Mmm-hmm.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.241
And we are getting close
to shutting it down.

03:20.635 --> 03:23.502
And since the police
will be looking for me...

03:23.504 --> 03:24.803
What... Hey.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.304
You can't be startled.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.562
Ever.

03:27.565 --> 03:30.541
You have to see into the
shadows, look around corners,

03:30.544 --> 03:35.215
because if you breathe
at the wrong time,

03:35.218 --> 03:36.748
you die.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.117
Got it?

03:40.291 --> 03:41.852
Yeah, I got it.

03:41.855 --> 03:46.158
All right, well, since the
police are looking for me,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.360
I'm sure with a shoot-to-kill mentality,

03:48.362 --> 03:50.762
so we have to clear Black Lightning

03:50.764 --> 03:52.107
before I can get back in the suit.

03:52.109 --> 03:55.133
- Okay.
- Okay, first training mission,

03:55.135 --> 03:58.136
we find whoever killed Lady Eve.

03:58.138 --> 04:00.038
Now you listen to me,
do whatever I tell you,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.073
and hopefully you will
learn a few things.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.011
- You ready?
- Yep. Ready.

04:07.546 --> 04:08.778
Urban crowd.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.186
We was just using the stage because...

05:02.669 --> 05:05.036
Nobody was.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.405
Ever since that shootout,
Tobias ain't been around,

05:07.407 --> 05:10.308
- so we weren't sure if we was...
- That sounded good.

05:12.289 --> 05:13.822
And that's what's up.

05:16.091 --> 05:17.649
Where you been at, Lala?

05:19.786 --> 05:21.353
They told us you wasn't coming back.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.880
Who's "they"?

05:22.883 --> 05:24.416
There were rumors.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.662
"Rumors"?

05:31.465 --> 05:34.684
Yeah, like, you were in jail or...

05:34.687 --> 05:36.020
Or what?

05:41.742 --> 05:43.380
That you were dead.

05:43.383 --> 05:45.035
"Dead"?

05:48.466 --> 05:50.382
Yeah, I think I was.

Damn.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.326
I regret not killing Black
Lightning the minute he returned.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.395
It was the logical choice
based on what we knew.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.294
And now Lady Eve is dead.

06:39.297 --> 06:40.832
We can't be sure he killed her.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.134
She and her bodyguards
were fried with electricity.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.497
What other proof do you need?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.804
Someone could have set him up.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.606
- Who would do that?
- I don't know, I just...

06:47.608 --> 06:49.492
I value your counsel,
Peter, and I usually

06:49.495 --> 06:52.711
appreciate your measured approach,

06:52.713 --> 06:54.212
not today.

06:54.214 --> 07:00.185
He was a nuisance, now he's a
danger to me, to you, to the ASA.

07:02.389 --> 07:04.255
I've put a price on his black ass.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.757
That's a mistake, Martin.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.493
If we catch him, who knows how
he could advance our understanding

07:08.495 --> 07:09.861
of enhanced human abilities?

07:09.863 --> 07:10.962
We should just wait...

07:10.964 --> 07:12.764
ASA's dissected enough metas.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.433
One more isn't going to
help us create our own.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.345
Lady Eve was the liaison
between us and The One Hundred.

07:18.348 --> 07:21.139
She got Green Light on the streets
faster than anyone in the country.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.895
Her murder sets the
Freeland experiment back.

07:23.898 --> 07:25.631
Yes, that's true,

07:25.634 --> 07:27.512
but there's no harm in making sure

07:27.514 --> 07:30.645
that killing Black Lightning is the
right thing to do before we do it.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.988
I don't like power I don't control.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.623
When Black Lightning returned,

07:38.625 --> 07:41.259
you said you would figure out
who he was and take care of him.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.293
You didn't,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.562
so I'm bringing ASA operatives into town

07:44.564 --> 07:46.631
to kill him, plain and simple.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.739
Give me any information you have
that will help them track him down.

07:49.742 --> 07:51.836
- Martin...
- I'm sick of this neighborhood, Peter.

07:51.838 --> 07:55.340
They don't take care of
it, the food is all fried.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.409
The only thing the people here
are good for is experimentation.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.144
They should be happy we're here.

07:59.146 --> 08:02.047
Green Light will give their
lives purpose, direction.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.247
We're doing God's work, Peter.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.750
God's work.

08:22.290 --> 08:23.960
Jennifer already eat?

08:23.962 --> 08:25.896
No, I don't think so.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.898
She's upstairs moping.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.048
I told her that

08:29.051 --> 08:32.101
until she finds an appropriate
after-school activity,

08:32.104 --> 08:35.071
she'd have to do an unpaid
internship at my lab.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.240
Ouch.

08:36.243 --> 08:38.308
Well, I figured cleaning
up after the break-in

08:38.309 --> 08:39.708
might drive her back to track.

08:39.711 --> 08:42.178
Yeah, or teach her how
to pick up after herself.

08:42.181 --> 08:43.712
I'd settle for that one.

08:43.715 --> 08:44.915
Yeah.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.000
How was training?

08:51.957 --> 08:53.189
It's good.

08:55.594 --> 08:57.027
It's okay that I asked, right?

08:57.029 --> 09:00.664
And there's no code that
says a mother can't know

09:00.666 --> 09:02.666
how her daughter's
doing with her powers.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.946
No, no. Look, I know...

09:04.949 --> 09:06.616
I know how hard this is for you.

09:06.619 --> 09:09.471
A million times worse than watching
our kids learn how to ride bikes.

09:09.474 --> 09:11.759
Scraped foreheads I can handle,

09:11.762 --> 09:14.110
but the thought that she might not...

09:14.112 --> 09:15.812
No. Uh-uh, uh-uh.

09:15.814 --> 09:18.148
No catastrophic thoughts.

09:18.151 --> 09:20.050
Hmm?

09:22.020 --> 09:24.185
Besides, she is really
taking it seriously.

09:24.188 --> 09:27.056
'Cause she wants an A or because
she thinks it's important?

09:28.260 --> 09:30.226
Well, I think because she knows

09:30.228 --> 09:32.062
I won't let her go out
with me if she doesn't.

09:34.066 --> 09:35.894
Look, right now, I'm just trying to help

09:35.897 --> 09:37.767
her understand that
she's not invincible,

09:37.777 --> 09:40.111
so she doesn't hurt
herself or someone else.

09:42.073 --> 09:44.706
You know Anissa's problem,
it's the same as it always is.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.592
She reacts, usually
from an emotional place,

09:47.595 --> 09:49.512
without thinking about the consequences.

09:49.514 --> 09:51.681
- Do you remember in second grade...
- Hmm.

09:51.683 --> 09:53.083
When she got suspended...

09:53.085 --> 09:54.451
- Oh.
- For kicking her teacher

09:54.453 --> 09:56.553
'cause she thought he
made her friend cry?

09:56.555 --> 09:59.456
Yes. Oh, yes.

10:01.671 --> 10:02.870
Yeah.

10:05.764 --> 10:08.298
The stakes are different now.

10:08.300 --> 10:11.101
How do you train someone
to be what they're not?

10:13.271 --> 10:14.938
She has her mother's brains.

10:14.940 --> 10:19.676
It won't take her long to realize
that if she wants to change the world,

10:19.678 --> 10:21.444
she has to change herself.

10:30.055 --> 10:32.255
Why can't Kam help us?

10:32.257 --> 10:34.392
Because Kam has a PhD and better things

10:34.395 --> 10:36.528
to do than clean up after the break-in.

10:37.712 --> 10:40.232
Okay, well, you have a PhD and an MD.

10:40.235 --> 10:43.202
That's true. Maybe I should
let you do it yourself.

10:43.205 --> 10:44.407
That's not what I meant.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.701
No, I know what you meant.

10:45.704 --> 10:47.181
What you meant is this is boring

10:47.184 --> 10:49.350
and you'd rather be
doing something else.

10:49.353 --> 10:51.134
Right. That's... That's what I meant.

10:51.137 --> 10:53.109
Look, just because you
dropped your activities

10:53.111 --> 10:54.404
does not mean your father and I

10:54.407 --> 10:57.653
are going to let you spend all your
free time texting with your friends.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.084
So, what's up with Dad and Anissa?

11:02.790 --> 11:04.865
- What do you mean?
- You haven't noticed?

11:04.868 --> 11:08.291
They've been acting really
weird, at least around me.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.803
They were mad at each other,
and wouldn't tell me why.

11:10.806 --> 11:13.038
And now it seems like they're 98 and

11:13.041 --> 11:15.333
two, but sharing some kind of secret.

11:16.418 --> 11:17.684
Something's going on.

11:17.687 --> 11:19.069
Look, everything's fine.

11:19.071 --> 11:21.638
Families go through stuff. It's normal.

11:23.075 --> 11:26.282
Wait, did... did you see
any old papers in here?

11:26.285 --> 11:27.484
No.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.788
On yellow legal pages?
They were kinda crumpled.

11:31.550 --> 11:32.649
Still no.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.383
They're all gone.

11:34.386 --> 11:35.718
What's gone?

11:35.721 --> 11:37.520
Uh...

11:37.522 --> 11:40.090
I have to pick something up.

11:40.092 --> 11:41.891
You're free to go home.

11:42.794 --> 11:43.993
Yes.

11:45.063 --> 11:46.229
Oh, um...

11:46.231 --> 11:48.631
Can I hang up posters
with Kiesha at the school?

11:48.633 --> 11:50.196
Yeah, but then go home.

11:50.199 --> 11:53.103
Um, it'll be sort of late.

11:53.105 --> 11:55.605
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:04.837 --> 12:07.217
Okay, what are you hoping to find?

12:08.453 --> 12:09.819
I don't know.

12:09.821 --> 12:12.422
But the police have already
cleaned up the crime scene,

12:12.424 --> 12:15.091
and Gambi said the official
report is short on details,

12:15.093 --> 12:16.493
so Lady Eve's body

12:16.495 --> 12:18.390
is the only evidence we
have to look at right now.

12:18.392 --> 12:20.130
Which doesn't mean this is a good idea.

12:20.132 --> 12:22.146
Look, you said the building was empty

12:22.149 --> 12:25.135
and you picked a route that would
keep us off camera surveillance, so...

12:25.137 --> 12:27.537
I did say those things,
but I just meant in general.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.053
I heard a rumor that there's a big

12:30.056 --> 12:32.008
reward out for Black
Lightning's capture.

12:32.010 --> 12:35.438
Oh, yes, this is the perfect time
to give me that bit of information.

12:35.441 --> 12:37.443
Who's putting up the money?

12:37.446 --> 12:39.449
I don't know.

12:39.451 --> 12:42.185
We're at the janitor's closet. Now what?

12:42.187 --> 12:45.155
The spot you want is just
ahead, below the vent.

12:49.661 --> 12:50.860
Okay.

12:52.063 --> 12:54.764
And this is where Gambi says
is the best place to break in.

12:54.767 --> 12:55.966
All right.

12:58.103 --> 12:59.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:01.206 --> 13:02.772
How much force do you need?

13:06.011 --> 13:07.977
Uh... enough to get through the wall.

13:07.979 --> 13:10.046
And how much is that?

13:12.417 --> 13:13.650
I don't know.

13:15.987 --> 13:17.353
Tap it with your finger.

13:20.102 --> 13:21.368
Okay.

13:25.497 --> 13:26.850
Okay.

13:26.853 --> 13:28.798
Clearly, that wasn't it.

13:30.535 --> 13:31.734
Whatever you think.

13:44.119 --> 13:48.638
Okay, maybe I could've
used a little less.

13:48.641 --> 13:50.186
You think?

14:10.141 --> 14:11.908
Twins?

14:15.113 --> 14:16.779
All right, let's see.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.618
- A-ha!
- Yeah?

14:21.620 --> 14:23.319
Looks like they'll pick her up tomorrow.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.887
Good thing we came tonight.

14:27.225 --> 14:28.424
Oh.

14:32.464 --> 14:34.631
All right, Gambi, you seeing this?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.400
Yeah, I got it.

14:37.402 --> 14:38.701
Pick up her arm.

14:39.537 --> 14:41.136
Her arm?

14:41.139 --> 14:42.538
Gently.

14:42.541 --> 14:43.741
Go on.

14:45.644 --> 14:47.674
When you work with cadavers in school,

14:47.677 --> 14:49.188
do you ever think about who they were?

14:49.190 --> 14:50.113
No.

14:50.115 --> 14:54.217
Yeah, well, she had a life, family.

14:54.219 --> 14:57.654
You know, yesterday, she might
have been making a grocery list,

14:57.656 --> 14:58.988
planning a family get-together,

14:58.990 --> 15:01.375
and then someone killed her,
for whatever their reasons,

15:01.378 --> 15:02.951
not caring about who would be left

15:02.954 --> 15:04.794
behind to mourn the loss of her passing.

15:04.796 --> 15:06.367
And even if you do care,

15:06.370 --> 15:08.203
people are gonna die just the same

15:08.206 --> 15:10.533
if you don't learn to
modulate your powers.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.902
More importantly, your
mother, Jennifer and myself

15:12.904 --> 15:14.476
will mourn the loss if you get killed

15:14.479 --> 15:16.706
- because you weren't vigilant.
- Jefferson.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.775
So you need to stay
woke, and as always...

15:18.777 --> 15:20.376
- Jefferson.
- What?

15:20.378 --> 15:23.046
Oh... If she had been
killed by a lightning strike

15:23.048 --> 15:24.881
or a Black Lightning strike,

15:24.883 --> 15:27.450
Dad, there'd be a tree
pattern on her skin.

15:28.853 --> 15:32.055
What she said. It's called
Lichtenberg scarring.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.010
It's a fractal pattern that occurs

15:34.013 --> 15:36.609
when electricity passes
through an insulating material.

15:36.612 --> 15:40.863
This is more of a burn, like it
was caused by a high-voltage flash.

15:40.865 --> 15:43.166
So this was caused by
some kind of a weapon?

15:43.168 --> 15:44.300
I believe so.

15:44.302 --> 15:45.702
Black Lightning's never killed anyone,

15:45.704 --> 15:47.503
so I understand how the
coroner wouldn't know

15:47.505 --> 15:49.305
what kind of wound
pattern he might create.

15:49.307 --> 15:51.708
How much power would a
weapon like this take?

15:53.111 --> 15:54.377
A billion joules.

15:55.980 --> 15:58.314
Well, how would you do
that in something portable?

15:59.851 --> 16:01.351
With nuclear power.

16:03.054 --> 16:04.617
You can track radiation, right?

16:04.620 --> 16:07.657
Which means we might be able to
find the weapon that killed her?

16:09.094 --> 16:10.298
Yes.

16:10.301 --> 16:11.767
Okay, we're done here.

16:12.597 --> 16:13.823
Um...

16:13.826 --> 16:17.166
All right, brains, not brawn.

16:17.169 --> 16:19.436
Good job, Anissa. Let's go.

16:31.288 --> 16:32.504
Hey.

16:32.507 --> 16:33.635
We are closed.

16:33.638 --> 16:34.965
Please. It's important.

16:34.968 --> 16:36.601
I can't accept any samples.

16:36.604 --> 16:39.613
Well, I'm here for a report on
something I dropped off a few days ago.

16:39.616 --> 16:41.429
We had a break-in.

16:41.432 --> 16:42.765
- What?
- Yeah.

16:42.768 --> 16:45.198
Got some equipment stolen,
a whole bunch of samples.

16:45.201 --> 16:46.668
They screwed up our computers.

16:46.670 --> 16:50.238
Cops think it was junkies looking
for drugs and stuff to sell.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.739
We just started notifying people,

16:51.741 --> 16:53.975
but I might not have what you came for.

16:53.977 --> 16:56.144
Can you check to see if
my sample was affected?

16:56.146 --> 16:57.972
- Yeah.
- It's for Doctor Lynn Stewart.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.036
It was a powder.

16:59.039 --> 17:01.006
I asked you to do an
X-ray crystallography.

17:05.121 --> 17:07.488
Yeah, it looks like your sample
was one of the ones taken,

17:07.490 --> 17:10.992
and the results file was corrupted
when they trashed our computers.

17:10.993 --> 17:12.226
You must have a backup.

17:12.228 --> 17:14.519
Partitioned on the same
drive. I'm really sorry.

17:14.521 --> 17:15.576
There must be a printout.

17:15.579 --> 17:18.066
I always print a hard copy when
I'm double-checking my results.

17:18.068 --> 17:20.867
These guys made a real
mess. It could take...

17:22.105 --> 17:23.404
What?

17:23.406 --> 17:25.772
We've had someone on maternity
leave for the last month.

17:25.775 --> 17:27.407
I'm really behind.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.978
Maybe there's a copy in
the "to-be-filed" folder.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.512
Oh, could you check? Please.

17:31.514 --> 17:33.247
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

17:35.952 --> 17:39.121
You know, I'm not one to judge a
person's extracurricular activities,

17:39.124 --> 17:42.190
but I don't know how you ended
up with student government.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.625
Whoever controls the money
controls the school, so...

17:44.627 --> 17:46.427
Oh, so, this is a power play?

17:46.429 --> 17:49.285
Yeah. Just like your mama
making you work in her lab.

17:49.288 --> 17:51.599
Nah, she's just worried
I won't get into Harvard

17:51.601 --> 17:53.762
if I'm sitting around texting you.

17:53.765 --> 17:55.737
- Oh, That's cute.
- Ah, thank you.

17:55.739 --> 17:57.338
Wait, you're applying to Harvard?

17:58.291 --> 17:59.691
Not the point.

17:59.694 --> 18:00.972
Okay.

18:00.975 --> 18:02.643
Send it to me.

18:02.645 --> 18:03.845
Okay.

18:04.848 --> 18:06.047
Ooh.

18:09.138 --> 18:10.304
Hey, what you doing?

18:10.307 --> 18:13.053
I'm gonna put one up here
so nobody takes it down.

18:13.056 --> 18:14.389
No, Kiesha, that's dumb.

18:14.391 --> 18:15.590
Get down before you kill yourself.

18:15.592 --> 18:17.301
Getting kidnapped made you so emo.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.726
Getting kidnapped didn't make
me emo. You're making me emo.

18:19.729 --> 18:20.995
Kiesha, I'm serious.

18:20.997 --> 18:22.330
Oh, my God.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.308
That's really unsafe,
you need to get down.

18:27.783 --> 18:29.149
I'm serious.

18:29.939 --> 18:31.722
Kiesha, please.

18:31.725 --> 18:32.974
Kiesha!

18:48.109 --> 18:49.408
Okay, I'm fine.

18:52.495 --> 18:54.529
Damn, girl, you dropped your phone.

18:57.067 --> 18:59.734
Yeah, scared you were
gonna break your neck.

18:59.736 --> 19:02.970
Ah, no. Hey, now you got
an excuse to get a new one.

19:02.972 --> 19:05.640
I'm thinking maybe I
should change my slogan.

19:05.642 --> 19:08.810
"I bounce, so our class
money won't have to."

19:32.836 --> 19:36.504
So, now that you're
back, what's your plan?

19:38.875 --> 19:40.408
I don't know yet.

19:41.285 --> 19:43.044
The man without a plan.

19:43.046 --> 19:45.880
You know word on the street
is you're dead, right?

19:45.882 --> 19:48.316
And that one's trying to take your spot.

19:49.052 --> 19:51.052
Ain't nobody can take my spot.

19:51.054 --> 19:52.954
Dead or alive.

20:01.037 --> 20:04.139
I can't believe you letting
these dudes drive you home.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.869
You do understand they'll
know where you live, right?

20:07.872 --> 20:09.370
They cool.

20:09.372 --> 20:11.973
How can you know that for sure?

20:11.975 --> 20:14.041
You killed me for putting
a camera in your face.

20:14.043 --> 20:17.245
I told you to take your ass home.

20:17.247 --> 20:19.614
So when they come for you,
you going to kill them, too?

20:19.616 --> 20:21.082
I don't know yet.

20:21.085 --> 20:22.449
I might.

20:23.379 --> 20:24.819
But they won't come for me.

20:24.828 --> 20:27.672
Nah. I don't think you should wait.

20:27.675 --> 20:29.241
I don't trust them.

20:29.244 --> 20:31.592
Especially that one.

20:31.594 --> 20:34.128
You definitely should
kill him right now.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.463
Kill my dude?

20:35.465 --> 20:36.831
Yeah.

20:38.301 --> 20:41.068
He's driving the car. You want to crash?

20:43.006 --> 20:45.406
LaWanda, you crazy.

20:46.009 --> 20:47.608
I'm good.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.977
I'm just saying, people turn.

20:49.979 --> 20:51.479
I said I'm good.

20:54.083 --> 20:55.983
Everything cool, Lala?

21:01.381 --> 21:02.747
Yeah.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.271
So, this satellite tracks radiation?

21:09.274 --> 21:11.274
- Yes.
- Everywhere in the world?

21:12.163 --> 21:14.926
The two of you continuing this
investigation is a bad idea,

21:14.929 --> 21:17.571
even if you're not dressed as
Black Lightning and Thunder.

21:17.574 --> 21:19.373
We have to clear Black Lightning's name.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.708
- Yes.
- I agree,

21:20.710 --> 21:21.976
but please, let me do it.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.445
If you get caught digging
into Lady Eve's murder,

21:24.447 --> 21:27.281
someone could put two and two
together and realize who you are.

21:27.283 --> 21:28.983
Then I will make sure
that doesn't happen.

21:28.985 --> 21:30.585
Yes, let's go then.

21:30.587 --> 21:33.654
Yo, wait. Wait. When you power up,
are you susceptible to radiation?

21:34.958 --> 21:35.969
I don't know.

21:35.972 --> 21:38.129
- Chemicals?
- I don't know.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.465
Okay, what about water?

21:39.468 --> 21:41.594
Are you like a witch? Do
you sink or can you swim?

21:41.597 --> 21:43.698
- I don't know.
- You don't know a lot.

21:46.102 --> 21:47.368
What are you waiting for?

21:47.371 --> 21:50.404
You, to come to your senses.

21:54.465 --> 21:56.517
Wait, that's Lady Eve being killed.

21:58.406 --> 22:01.790
Oh, that's Hampton Woods.
What are they doing out there?

22:01.793 --> 22:03.985
I don't know. But please,
let me go check it out.

22:03.987 --> 22:05.720
You're not putting me in any danger.

22:05.722 --> 22:07.922
There's no bounty on me, and
I can take care of myself.

22:07.924 --> 22:10.113
No, I need to train Anissa, Gambi.

22:10.116 --> 22:11.926
Besides, I can take care of myself, too.

22:11.928 --> 22:14.562
So, unless you can tell me a
reason why this is more dangerous

22:14.564 --> 22:16.998
than all the other crazy things
you let me do over the years...

22:17.000 --> 22:18.399
I'm just trying to help you.

22:18.401 --> 22:20.935
Which I appreciate, but I can handle it.

22:24.741 --> 22:27.141
You're just so damn stubborn, Jefferson.

22:27.143 --> 22:28.342
Gambi!

23:15.953 --> 23:18.176
Dad, you know how I
feel about the woods.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.856
No. Black people die in the woods.

23:20.858 --> 23:24.326
Yes, in horror movies,

23:24.328 --> 23:27.329
but only after the monster
kills the white nerd.

23:27.331 --> 23:30.298
And we don't have one of
those with us, so you're good.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.559
Okay.

23:32.562 --> 23:33.609
Wait, hold on.

23:35.672 --> 23:37.105
- Hey, Lynn.
- Hi.

23:37.107 --> 23:42.794
I found something disturbing,
I guess is the right word.

23:42.797 --> 23:43.996
Are you okay?

23:43.999 --> 23:45.203
I'm fine.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.285
That sample Anissa brought over
from your father's investigation,

23:48.288 --> 23:51.273
I analyzed it, and it's a vaccine.

23:51.276 --> 23:52.842
A vaccine?

23:52.845 --> 23:54.311
- For what?
- I'm not sure.

23:54.313 --> 23:56.780
But what I am sure about is
the components of the vaccine

23:56.782 --> 23:59.750
are the same active
ingredients in Green Light.

23:59.752 --> 24:03.420
Wait, the sample Anissa
found was from 1986.

24:03.422 --> 24:06.523
Are you saying someone's been
working on Green Light for 30 years?

24:06.525 --> 24:07.824
It looks like it.

24:10.562 --> 24:14.064
Okay, well, if we figure
out who produced the vaccine,

24:14.066 --> 24:16.333
then maybe we can find
out who's behind all this.

24:16.335 --> 24:17.247
Well, I tried,

24:17.250 --> 24:19.918
but I've struck out with my pool
of doctors and health officials.

24:19.921 --> 24:21.838
Thirty years is a long time ago.

24:21.840 --> 24:23.807
You know what, talk to Gambi.

24:23.809 --> 24:25.676
He's been in Freeland almost as long.

24:25.678 --> 24:29.346
He may not know anything, but he'll
know someone who knows something.

24:29.349 --> 24:31.437
- And, Lynn?
- Yeah?

24:32.451 --> 24:34.017
Please be careful.

24:35.054 --> 24:36.286
Of course.

How was your daughter's wedding?

25:10.255 --> 25:12.222
Oh, she was beautiful.

25:12.224 --> 25:13.757
And so was I, thanks to you.

25:17.396 --> 25:19.262
Is there anything I can do for you?

25:39.917 --> 25:42.118
That the good Lord delivers
us from our troubles?

25:42.121 --> 25:43.186
Yes.

25:43.188 --> 25:44.388
I do.

25:44.390 --> 25:47.057
He expects us to do our part,

25:53.632 --> 25:57.601

26:00.639 --> 26:02.539
I see the wisdom in that.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.976
You will be in my prayers, Mr. Gambi.

26:05.985 --> 26:07.818
You will be in my prayers.

So, once you realized you had powers,

26:21.760 --> 26:24.132
how long until you decided
to become Black Lightning?

26:24.135 --> 26:26.395
Uh, I did a few things here and there,

26:26.398 --> 26:30.434
but it took me a while before
I committed and got the suit.

26:30.436 --> 26:32.179
Why'd you stop all those years?

26:33.663 --> 26:35.504
That's complicated.

26:35.507 --> 26:36.540
Mom, right?

26:36.542 --> 26:38.559
That's between me and her.

26:38.562 --> 26:40.110
- Which is a "yes."
- Yeah.

26:40.112 --> 26:42.332
But an "ask your mother" yes.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.947
So, who trained you?

26:43.949 --> 26:45.934
- Gambi. Fighting and tactics.
- Oh.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.695
Even before I knew I had powers.

26:47.698 --> 26:49.317
And why is so he mad at you right now?

26:49.320 --> 26:51.621
No, no. He's not mad. He's worried.

26:51.624 --> 26:54.424
That's how he gets when I
don't do what he wants me to.

26:54.426 --> 26:56.793
Sarcastic Italian, that's
how he shows his love.

26:58.030 --> 27:02.132
Wait, hold on. It should
be right around here.

27:02.134 --> 27:03.734
Right there.

27:17.382 --> 27:19.328
I guess we can be
grateful for the second

27:19.331 --> 27:21.920
rule of high-profile assassinations.

27:23.522 --> 27:25.388
Always kill the killer.

27:30.333 --> 27:32.967
Okay. What now?

27:32.969 --> 27:34.068
I call Henderson.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.069
This is evidence.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.004
Black Lightning doesn't get exonerated

27:37.006 --> 27:40.608
unless Freeland PD conducts an
investigation and clears him.

27:41.719 --> 27:43.218
Whoa, you call him on that?

27:43.221 --> 27:46.047
I mean, was carrying a tin can
attached to a string too bulky?

27:47.617 --> 27:50.239
This is current technology.

27:50.242 --> 27:51.919
Okay.

27:51.921 --> 27:53.287
Let me see that.

27:55.825 --> 27:57.218
Yo, Henderson.

27:57.221 --> 27:59.494
You got a pencil and paper?

27:59.496 --> 28:06.033
Hampton Woods,
coordinates 33, 47, 84, 43.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.404
You'll find a shallow grave, a body,

28:10.406 --> 28:12.940
and the weapon that
actually killed Lady Eve.

28:12.942 --> 28:16.177
Heyo, tell the morgue to hold the
body so you can match the wound.

28:16.179 --> 28:18.038
You're welcome.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.906
I know you didn't say thank you.

28:19.909 --> 28:22.116
It's implied in your
loud-ass questions.

28:26.456 --> 28:27.955
Does he know you're Black Lightning?

28:27.957 --> 28:31.507
No. That would put him
in an impossible position.

28:31.510 --> 28:33.594
Yeah, because of that lame cell phone.

28:43.873 --> 28:45.072
Okay.

29:36.993 --> 29:38.796
I'll be right there.

29:38.799 --> 29:40.663
Gambi, it's Lynn.

29:40.666 --> 29:42.295
Take your time.

29:42.298 --> 29:44.665
I was hoping you could
help me with something.

29:56.273 --> 29:58.145
I, uh...

29:58.148 --> 30:01.449
I hope your help
involves the silk damask

30:01.451 --> 30:04.819
because my supplier accidentally
left me two bolts of it.

30:04.822 --> 30:06.355
I'm afraid not.

30:06.358 --> 30:09.456
Yeah. Well, then let's pray purple
suits come back into fashion.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.359
What do you need?

30:11.361 --> 30:16.230
Well, I've been doing some analysis
of a vaccine from 30 years ago.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.566
That's a long time ago.
Why the interest now?

30:18.568 --> 30:20.203
Well, I just got the sample.

30:20.206 --> 30:22.175
It was in a box of research for a series

30:22.178 --> 30:23.906
of articles that Alvin was writing.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.624
Alvin Pierce?

30:29.627 --> 30:31.879
Yeah.

30:31.881 --> 30:34.649
Turns out that the vaccine's
related to Green Light.

30:34.651 --> 30:36.951
But I want to know where it came from.

30:36.953 --> 30:38.382
Problem is, it's so old,

30:38.385 --> 30:41.084
there's no information about the
drug company that developed it.

30:41.087 --> 30:43.355
Do you remember a doctor
or a clinic director

30:43.358 --> 30:45.234
who was working in the
community back then?

30:45.237 --> 30:46.249
No.

30:46.252 --> 30:48.095
Well, a vaccine has to
be government-approved.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.563
Did you have any contacts that maybe

30:49.565 --> 30:51.432
- might be able to answer...
- Lynn.

30:53.836 --> 30:55.636
I can't talk about this.

31:02.645 --> 31:04.111
Thirty years ago.

31:05.848 --> 31:08.983
You moved here around the time
the vaccine came to Freeland.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.721
You never talk about
your life before Freeland.

31:14.824 --> 31:16.824
- No.
- You never wanted to share anything.

31:16.827 --> 31:20.794
We assumed you had your reasons.

31:20.797 --> 31:22.797
- I did.
- Gambi,

31:23.734 --> 31:26.648
Jefferson trusts you.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.469
I know.

31:31.486 --> 31:33.052
I think...

31:34.811 --> 31:37.378
I think it's time for me
to have a talk with him.

31:42.749 --> 31:44.452
Excuse me, Lynn.

31:49.192 --> 31:53.260
Okay, I've finally realized the
most important part of a stakeout.

31:54.564 --> 31:55.763
Go to the bathroom first?

31:55.765 --> 31:57.732
Uh, that would have helped a lot more

31:57.734 --> 32:01.235
than all of your "you're
going to die" talk.

32:05.842 --> 32:06.903
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:06.906 --> 32:08.977
Dad. There's somebody over there.

32:12.448 --> 32:14.081
Wait, wait, wait. That's not right.

32:14.084 --> 32:15.717
What's not?

32:15.720 --> 32:17.198
Well, Henderson would have sent

32:17.201 --> 32:19.153
uniformed officers to secure the scene,

32:19.155 --> 32:23.050
a crime scene unit, not a
lone person in street clothes.

32:23.053 --> 32:24.819
Okay, well, then who is he?

32:26.458 --> 32:29.038
Freeland PD is full of dirty cops.

32:29.899 --> 32:31.632
So, I'm guessing someone must've

32:31.634 --> 32:34.235
intercepted Henderson's
dispatch and sent him first.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.254
All right, stay here.

32:37.257 --> 32:39.673
- Stay here? Dad, I should go with you.
- No, no. Stay here.

32:39.675 --> 32:41.809
- I'm just going to see what he's doing.
- I...

32:41.811 --> 32:44.044
I can disable him from
a distance if I have to.

32:44.046 --> 32:45.479
Stay here.

33:09.316 --> 33:10.624
Wait.

33:16.679 --> 33:18.279
- Dad!
- I told you...

33:29.826 --> 33:33.327
Dad, I could tell he didn't know
that those weapons were dangerous.

33:35.531 --> 33:37.898
Whoever sent him, they
thought he was expendable.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.300
He just didn't know.

33:52.237 --> 33:53.636
I spent all this time

33:53.638 --> 33:56.706
telling her she had to
anticipate danger or she'd die,

33:56.708 --> 34:00.176
and then I failed to anticipate
danger and almost get myself killed.

34:01.549 --> 34:04.513
She has to understand her powers,
and I can help her with that.

34:04.515 --> 34:05.942
Mmm.

34:05.945 --> 34:08.150
But I was trying to change her.

34:08.152 --> 34:12.121
Her understanding of people,
her desire to protect.

34:12.123 --> 34:16.659
No, no, no. I have to be very
careful not to screw that.

34:16.661 --> 34:19.059
Not just because she saved my life.

34:19.062 --> 34:20.963
She saved my life.

34:23.735 --> 34:25.635
I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:25.637 --> 34:29.237
I'm... rambling. Endorphins.

34:33.411 --> 34:34.844
Are you waiting for Jennifer?

34:36.484 --> 34:37.746
No.

34:40.451 --> 34:42.851
You got your sad eyes.

34:42.855 --> 34:44.887
What's going on?

34:47.025 --> 34:48.858
I went to see Gambi, like you suggested,

34:48.860 --> 34:51.487
to see if he could help me
find the source of that vaccine.

34:51.489 --> 34:52.688
Yeah.

34:54.085 --> 34:57.273
It turns out, he knows
more than I thought.

34:59.976 --> 35:01.322
What do you mean?

35:03.408 --> 35:05.942
Jefferson, you need to talk to Gambi.

35:05.944 --> 35:09.211
Ask him the questions we've never asked.

35:09.220 --> 35:13.256
To find out who he is...
and where he came from.

35:15.267 --> 35:16.800
What did he tell you?

35:18.957 --> 35:21.958
Just... go talk to Gambi.

35:37.675 --> 35:39.241
I have so many questions.

35:39.243 --> 35:41.077
If I was dead, then how did I die?

35:49.546 --> 35:51.146
How did I come back?

35:56.794 --> 35:58.227
Why did I come back?

36:01.866 --> 36:04.900
I know, baby. I know.

36:07.627 --> 36:09.861
But it's all going to be okay.

37:08.733 --> 37:11.133
Lynn said I needed to talk to you.

37:18.243 --> 37:22.489
I was just... trying to protect you.

37:22.492 --> 37:24.747
Protect me from what?

37:24.749 --> 37:26.215
All these years...

37:28.453 --> 37:30.086
I've kept secrets from you.

37:31.122 --> 37:32.822
I had to.

37:32.824 --> 37:38.227
But now the only way to protect
you is to tell you the truth,

37:38.229 --> 37:39.898
tell you everything.

37:39.901 --> 37:41.634
What are you talking about?

37:44.168 --> 37:46.869
My real name is Peter Esposito.

37:48.139 --> 37:49.839
Thirty years ago, I came to Freeland

37:49.841 --> 37:53.375
as an agent for a government
organization called the ASA.

37:53.377 --> 37:55.544
They were conducting an
experiment in Freeland,

37:55.546 --> 37:58.781
giving the people a
vaccine to make them passive

37:58.784 --> 38:00.583
and keep them docile

38:00.585 --> 38:03.219
in what was a very
politically-explosive environment.

38:04.322 --> 38:08.239
But their vaccine inadvertently
created metahumans.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.825
People with special powers.

38:10.828 --> 38:13.062
And it was my job to find them.

38:14.465 --> 38:18.434
But when I realized that the ASA's
vaccine was killing children...

38:22.049 --> 38:24.016
I leaked the information...

38:25.826 --> 38:27.226
to your father...

38:28.621 --> 38:30.954
and his investigation got him killed.

38:32.802 --> 38:34.201
Murdered.

38:37.243 --> 38:41.910
My father... was murdered.

38:41.913 --> 38:43.718
Yes, he was.

38:46.164 --> 38:50.032
And you turned me into Black Lightning?

38:50.034 --> 38:51.233
No.

38:52.670 --> 38:55.337
I know it doesn't make
what I've done better,

38:55.339 --> 38:57.606
but I had nothing to
do with that experiment.

38:57.608 --> 39:00.762
As soon as I realized
that you had powers,

39:00.765 --> 39:02.278
Alvin's kid,

39:03.347 --> 39:05.145
I knew I could never let them get you.

39:05.148 --> 39:11.293
And so all these years, I've tried
to protect you the best I could.

39:11.296 --> 39:13.722
- But now...
- But now, what?

39:15.826 --> 39:17.359
I can't anymore.

39:19.530 --> 39:21.497
Martin Proctor...

39:22.766 --> 39:24.973
the head of the ASA for this area,

39:24.976 --> 39:28.270
is looking for you,
and I can't stop him.

39:29.707 --> 39:33.531
If you use your powers or you go
out in the suit, he will find you,

39:33.534 --> 39:35.446
and they will kill you.

39:36.881 --> 39:42.518
And they will find Anissa...
and they will kill her, too.

39:42.520 --> 39:45.402
I'm sorry, Jefferson, but you
have to stop being Black Lightning.

39:45.405 --> 39:47.004
Stay away from me.

39:49.627 --> 39:51.794
Stay away from me.

39:52.697 --> 39:54.430
Stay away from my family.

40:02.129 --> 40:03.362
Must be here.

40:03.365 --> 40:06.275
Ah, Jen, whatever it is,
I don't have time for it.
