02:24.667 --> 02:30.667
<i>In 1931, the Russian film director
Sergei Eisenstein</i>

02:30.876 --> 02:33.417
<i>travelled to Mexico to make a film.</i>

02:33.917 --> 02:38.626
<i>It was tentatively to be called</i>
iQue viva Mexico!

02:39.667 --> 02:42.542
<i>Eisenstein had a worldwide fame</i>

02:42.626 --> 02:46.626
<i>based on the reputation of only three films,</i>

02:46.709 --> 02:48.917
<i>all made in Soviet Russia.</i>

02:50.584 --> 02:54.709
Strike, <i>a violent tale of civilian unrest</i>

02:54.834 --> 02:57.084
<i>viciously crushed by authority,</i>

02:58.584 --> 03:01.417
The Battleship Potemkin,<i> a violent account</i>

03:01.501 --> 03:04.876
<i>of a naval mutiny over rotten meat,</i>

03:05.917 --> 03:08.751
<i>and</i> October, <i>a violent celebration</i>

03:08.834 --> 03:10.709
<i>of the Russian Revolution.</i>

03:12.626 --> 03:15.209
<i>In the West, the film</i> October

03:15.292 --> 03:18.001
<i>was called</i> Ten Days That Shook The World.

03:19.501 --> 03:21.626
<i>This present film might be called</i>

03:21.709 --> 03:25.126
Ten Days That Shook Eisenstein.

04:15.292 --> 04:17.541
I arrive accompanied by flies.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.584
They have been with me ever since
I crossed the Mexican border.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.167
I brought them with me from Moscow.

04:32.751 --> 04:33.751
I recognise them.

04:34.209 --> 04:37.751
They are Soviet flies, spy flies...
Russian accents,

04:37.834 --> 04:40.626
a growling, gruff, ill-mannered buzz.

04:40.751 --> 04:42.334
They have bloodshot eyes, like me.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.209
Do I have bloodshot eyes?
Do I have bloodshot eyes?

04:44.292 --> 04:46.001
Do I have bloodshot eyes?
Do I have bloodshot eyes?

04:46.084 --> 04:48.001
Of too much looking. Too much...

04:48.084 --> 04:49.626
<i>Too much looking.</i>

04:49.709 --> 04:53.209
- Diego.
- Sergei, my friend!

04:53.834 --> 04:56.251
- You're welcome.
- <i>Grazie.</i>

04:56.792 --> 04:58.751
- Frida.
- Sergei.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.876
- <i>Bienvenido.</i>
- <i>Encantado.</i>

05:02.626 --> 05:05.126
Jorge Palomino Cañedo.
Your Guanajuato guide.

05:05.584 --> 05:06.959
Sergei Eisenstein.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.876
Sometimes a Russian film director

05:09.001 --> 05:11.084
or Russian film director retired.

05:12.751 --> 05:14.334
This is Aleksandrov.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.417
Always an actor.

05:17.292 --> 05:19.001
- Frida.
- Grisha.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.709
And this is Eduard Tisse, cameraman.

05:20.792 --> 05:22.209
The cameraman.

05:22.292 --> 05:23.292
- Frida.
- Tisse.

05:23.376 --> 05:24.584
Please take the suitcases.

05:25.584 --> 05:27.334
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.459
Hey, look.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.376
Put all the red books over there.

06:36.459 --> 06:39.376
All the books with the blue markers
over there.

06:39.459 --> 06:40.959
All English books by the bed.

06:42.626 --> 06:45.584
All American books under the bed.

07:17.626 --> 07:20.834
- Can I help?
- There is a trick, isn't there?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.376
What am I doing wrong?

07:22.459 --> 07:23.501
I expect nothing.

07:24.709 --> 07:27.167
We don't have showers in Moscow.

07:27.251 --> 07:28.959
In fact, we don't have showers in Russia.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.917
Baths, Turkish baths.

07:32.042 --> 07:34.001
And wash basins.

07:34.084 --> 07:37.459
Sometimes we have running water.
Sometimes we have water.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.626
Sometimes we have just the empty taps.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.042
Sometimes we have
to break the ice in the tank.

07:42.126 --> 07:43.126
Often...

07:43.917 --> 07:45.459
We don't wash.

07:58.317 --> 08:00.167
What are you laughing about?

08:00.251 --> 08:02.292
A Russian body. Very white.

08:02.376 --> 08:04.709
We rarely see the Sun in Moscow,

08:04.792 --> 08:07.292
and we never undress in public.

08:07.376 --> 08:09.751
- Then I can't be public.
- Public enough.

08:12.417 --> 08:13.626
That's his.

08:13.709 --> 08:16.209
And a very well-fed body.
Pea-soup, pickled cabbage,

08:16.292 --> 08:18.126
salty bacon, sour milk, turnips?

08:19.334 --> 08:20.376
When we can get it.

08:24.084 --> 08:25.751
See you at breakfast?

08:25.834 --> 08:29.042
Tortillas, tamales, chicken burritos,

08:29.126 --> 08:33.833
chimichangas, sopecitos,
huarachitos, pan de muerto...

08:33.917 --> 08:36.333
Hey! Warm water?

08:37.833 --> 08:39.208
Being naked in public?

08:40.167 --> 08:42.583
Or a response to an amiable young man?

08:44.167 --> 08:45.709
Signor Prick, behave!

08:46.584 --> 08:49.334
He's handsome, it's true.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.709
And he's seen you, it's true.

08:52.792 --> 08:57.042
But you are a foreigner
with a Russian passport,

08:57.126 --> 08:58.667
a limited visitor's visa,

08:58.751 --> 09:00.917
and very little sexual experience.

09:01.001 --> 09:02.667
You would be woefully disadvantaged.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.959
Besides, you are here to make a film with me,

09:06.042 --> 09:08.834
and I need your frustrations
to feed my imagination.

09:09.501 --> 09:10.501
No dissipation.

09:11.126 --> 09:13.834
It leads to a dilution of energy.

09:16.084 --> 09:18.626
<i>I am a boxer</i>

09:19.084 --> 09:22.792
for the freedom of cinematic expression.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.417
I have never had my shoes shined for me.

09:31.501 --> 09:33.917
We don't do those sorts of things
any more in Soviet Russia.

09:34.959 --> 09:36.542
You're in México.

09:36.626 --> 09:38.042
Why don't you try it?

10:00.542 --> 10:02.834
I'm behaving like a colonial grandee.

10:03.251 --> 10:06.084
Shining shoes is tantamount to kissing feet.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.959
Who kisses feet any more?

10:08.042 --> 10:10.667
Do I tip him heavily
to cover up my bourgeois guilt?

10:10.751 --> 10:11.751
No.

10:11.834 --> 10:14.376
If you tip him, news of your generosity

10:14.459 --> 10:16.417
will be around the town in five minutes.

10:16.501 --> 10:19.167
And your shoes will never be yours again.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.084
They will be a host to fortune.

10:23.084 --> 10:25.834
You have come here for something other
than shiny shoes.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.376
What are you looking for?

10:29.834 --> 10:32.251
I came to Mexico to make a movie.

10:33.126 --> 10:35.126
I came to Mexico

10:35.209 --> 10:37.751
because my very first
theatre production in Moscow

10:37.834 --> 10:40.042
was called <i>The Mexican.</i>

10:40.126 --> 10:44.542
I came to Mexico because
you had a successful revolution

10:44.626 --> 10:45.876
five years before we did.

10:45.959 --> 10:47.584
I came to Guanajuato

10:47.667 --> 10:49.459
because you have here
a Museum Of The Dead.

10:49.542 --> 10:52.167
Maybe I have to make a film called
<i>Museum Of The Living.</i>

10:52.251 --> 10:55.167
Those are my excuses.
What are your excuses?

10:56.126 --> 10:58.751
I live here. I have a family here.

10:58.834 --> 11:01.251
I teach in Mexico City, and I teach here.

11:01.334 --> 11:02.542
And what do you teach?

11:02.626 --> 11:04.959
I studied as an anthropologist.

11:05.042 --> 11:08.001
And now I teach comparative religion.

11:09.626 --> 11:11.209
This is a Roman Catholic country.

11:11.751 --> 11:14.251
How come you are allowed
to talk about other religions?

11:17.292 --> 11:20.667
Roman Catholicism of México
is generous and all-embracing.

11:21.209 --> 11:22.334
Pantheistic.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.792
A bit of everything. Old and new.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.042
They just take what they need.

11:26.584 --> 11:29.667
<i>So much so, we should call it
Mexican Catholicism.</i>

11:30.459 --> 11:32.084
<i>They customised it.</i>

11:32.167 --> 11:33.792
<i>We have pre-Columbian equivalents</i>

11:33.876 --> 11:36.376
<i>for everything the Roman Catholics dreamed up.</i>

11:36.459 --> 11:40.126
<i>Certainly, we invented blood sacrifices
before you did.</i>

11:40.751 --> 11:44.084
<i>Christianity adopted us.
We did not adopt Christianity.</i>

11:52.417 --> 11:54.959
It's Gideon. His name is Gideon.

11:57.251 --> 11:58.751
He was born blind.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.167
And the bells have made him deaf.

12:04.417 --> 12:05.709
There is a problem.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.209
They have been searching
through your books

12:07.292 --> 12:08.292
and found pornography.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.626
Are you a pornographer?

12:12.709 --> 12:14.001
I didn't think so up till now.

12:18.251 --> 12:20.001
One of the hotel maids arranging your books

12:20.084 --> 12:23.709
has taken some photographs,
but she is underage.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.584
Her mother found the photographs
and complained to the hotel.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.209
I am sure it can be sorted out.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.042
Stay in sight of your bodyguards.

14:34.459 --> 14:35.626
It's OK, boys.

14:38.376 --> 14:40.167
Sergei!

14:42.626 --> 14:44.459
Sergei!

14:55.834 --> 14:58.292
México!

14:58.376 --> 14:59.667
México!

15:05.501 --> 15:08.417
Guanajuato!

15:32.959 --> 15:34.959
Vomit and shit pour out of you in floods.

15:35.042 --> 15:36.126
I should not be here.

15:37.209 --> 15:39.334
I should be back in Russia,
being constipated.

15:39.417 --> 15:42.709
In Moscow, you can go for a week
without shitting once.

15:56.334 --> 15:58.751
Sergei? It's me. It's me, Cañedo. It's me.

16:04.417 --> 16:06.417
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.867
It's just me, Cañedo.
Hey, it's OK.

16:11.334 --> 16:12.084
Come on.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.001
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

16:28.959 --> 16:30.709
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.584
You know...

16:37.334 --> 16:40.501
You know, I sat like the Tsar

16:40.709 --> 16:43.876
on the throne of the Winter Palace.

16:45.584 --> 16:47.834
But the Tsar did not have running water.

16:48.251 --> 16:50.251
You Mexicans don't have tsars,

16:50.334 --> 16:52.167
but you do have running water.

16:53.501 --> 16:55.709
What is that noise?

16:55.792 --> 16:57.334
Someone banging on the pipes.

17:03.042 --> 17:04.126
Come on.

17:18.084 --> 17:19.709
OK. OK, hey.

17:20.084 --> 17:21.151
Wake up.

17:24.166 --> 17:25.376
Come on, come on.

17:32.542 --> 17:34.751
It's the 22nd of October.

17:35.501 --> 17:38.167
Someone is banging on the pipes

17:38.251 --> 17:42.709
to commemorate the start
of the Russian Revolution.

17:44.834 --> 17:48.501
No. It's the hotel plumber fixing the hot water.

17:48.751 --> 17:50.167
Go to sleep.

17:50.251 --> 17:52.876
The hot water of the Revolution.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.001
We shall all be cleansed

17:56.084 --> 18:00.209
with the hot water of the Revolution.

18:03.209 --> 18:04.334
Watch him carefully.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.792
Or you'll have Stalin on your backs.

18:06.876 --> 18:08.667
Stalin's reach is very long.

18:08.751 --> 18:10.751
If anything happens to him,

18:10.834 --> 18:13.042
you'll be picking ice
out of your asses in Siberia

18:13.126 --> 18:15.542
or have an ice-pick lodged in your brain!

18:32.959 --> 18:35.167
Here, your photographs.

18:35.876 --> 18:38.459
Put them away somewhere safe.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.042
Don't leave them lying around
for innocent chambermaids

18:41.126 --> 18:43.067
to steal and show to their mamás.

18:44.501 --> 18:46.042
But they are paintings.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.709
Mexican mothers
protecting their innocent daughters.

18:49.792 --> 18:52.042
We countered by accusing the maid
of stealing from guests.

18:52.626 --> 18:54.792
Is thievery worse than voyeurism?

18:55.876 --> 18:57.959
She should not be sacked for curiosity.

18:58.042 --> 18:59.584
You must get her reinstated.

19:01.042 --> 19:02.834
She's in the bar
with her mother and her father.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.751
- You could tell her yourself.
- No, you tell her.

19:04.834 --> 19:07.667
And tell her mother
her daughter's forgiven for stealing,

19:07.751 --> 19:09.709
and from now on, she's the only one

19:09.792 --> 19:11.626
to bring me my breakfast in bed
in the morning.

19:37.376 --> 19:40.542
The manager says it's a good job
she didn't take a look

19:40.626 --> 19:42.042
in your red suitcase.

19:42.126 --> 19:44.542
Oh? What's in the red suitcase?

19:44.626 --> 19:46.709
Enough to have you thrown in jail.

19:47.876 --> 19:50.626
And how did the manager

19:50.709 --> 19:52.792
know what was in the red suitcase?

19:53.876 --> 19:55.459
After the complaint, he searched everything.

19:56.667 --> 19:57.709
God, he has no right to do that.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.792
That's invasion of privacy!

20:00.676 --> 20:02.417
Look, he's winking at you.

20:03.376 --> 20:04.501
Curiously, it's a mark in your favour.

20:04.876 --> 20:07.417
But if you offend him,
he could use it against you.

20:08.084 --> 20:09.334
Tread carefully.

20:25.126 --> 20:26.959
The Camorristas.

20:27.042 --> 20:29.667
They are looking for
wealthy foreigners to prey on.

20:29.751 --> 20:31.501
They wait outside all the big hotels.

20:31.584 --> 20:34.501
And you are giving them
good reason to prey on you.

20:34.584 --> 20:36.376
That's why you have bodyguards.

20:39.792 --> 20:41.167
These are the small-time guys.

20:41.251 --> 20:43.001
We don't worry so much about them.

20:43.084 --> 20:46.126
They are posing as tough guys,
but they are lazy.

20:46.209 --> 20:48.167
The big guys are much tougher.

20:48.251 --> 20:50.959
And the real big guys, you'll never see.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.167
That's why you should try
and stop attracting attention.

20:56.251 --> 20:59.042
Don't get yourself photographed
and in the newspapers.

21:00.251 --> 21:02.292
If they smell a ransom possibility,

21:02.376 --> 21:04.751
they will be in and kidnap you.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.292
How much do you think you are worth?

21:07.709 --> 21:08.751
Not much.

21:10.667 --> 21:13.334
What will your government pay
to keep you alive?

21:13.417 --> 21:14.751
Nothing.

21:14.834 --> 21:18.167
Just trust that we are looking
after you properly.

21:18.251 --> 21:21.001
But maybe you are a Camorrista?

21:23.751 --> 21:27.376
If I am, then you are lost.

21:30.792 --> 21:32.126
You ought to make a film about them.

21:37.751 --> 21:39.667
The corpse at the door is wearing a red shirt,

21:39.751 --> 21:41.542
as you can see.

21:41.626 --> 21:45.001
Even among the dead,
the Camorristas have influence.

21:45.917 --> 21:48.334
Ransoming a corpse
is not uncommon in México.

23:36.376 --> 23:37.417
<i>Míralo.</i>

23:53.459 --> 23:55.876
Do you only have one suit?

23:55.959 --> 23:58.292
Well, I left Moscow with only $25.

23:58.376 --> 24:00.126
Russia has very little foreign currency,

24:00.209 --> 24:02.459
and that was all they could afford to give us.

24:02.542 --> 24:04.459
I get paid expenses here in Mexico.

24:04.542 --> 24:05.751
Or I get paid expenses,

24:05.834 --> 24:08.126
and I have to share with Tisse and Grisha.

24:09.251 --> 24:11.334
That suit is taking some punishment.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.001
You should buy yourself another.

24:13.084 --> 24:15.834
<i>It's my first American suit.
I bought it to walk down Sunset Boulevard</i>

24:15.917 --> 24:17.042
<i>with Charlie Chaplin.</i>

24:17.126 --> 24:20.001
<i>It's a sentimental matter.
I could not part with it.</i>

24:20.167 --> 24:23.167
This is my wife, Concepción.

24:26.667 --> 24:29.334
- This is Rolando.
- Good evening, sir.

24:29.417 --> 24:30.417
Good evening.

24:30.626 --> 24:32.584
The eldest was born
when I was studying troubadours

24:33.126 --> 24:36.667
and the second, Pascal,
when I reluctantly gave up God.

24:36.751 --> 24:39.167
Now I don't believe in God,
but I miss him,

24:39.251 --> 24:40.501
as did Pascal.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.501
I'm sorry. I have no Russian buttons.

24:43.584 --> 24:45.792
But these are curious.
What are they made of?

24:46.576 --> 24:47.792
Gun metal.

24:48.126 --> 24:51.626
They are stamped out
of discarded cartridge cases,

24:51.709 --> 24:53.167
pierced with two holes

24:53.251 --> 24:55.334
and glued to a piece of army blanket,

24:55.417 --> 24:57.501
which usually very quickly becomes unglued.

24:59.084 --> 25:00.876
A Russian soldier is told

25:00.959 --> 25:02.792
never to let his shoes out of his sight,

25:02.876 --> 25:04.084
if not out of his hand.

25:04.167 --> 25:07.459
Better still, always keep them on your feet.

25:07.542 --> 25:11.501
Shoes are the most precious item of clothing.

25:11.584 --> 25:14.126
Won't help your modesty,
scarcely keep you warm,

25:14.209 --> 25:18.376
but you will simply not be able
to function without shoes

25:18.459 --> 25:20.209
in any way at all.

25:23.417 --> 25:26.834
Don't worry. I'm a foreigner.
I'm a child abroad.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.667
Russia's so big
that nobody thinks about abroad.

25:29.751 --> 25:31.667
It's always too far away and well out of sight.

25:32.292 --> 25:33.792
We believe most of the time

25:33.876 --> 25:36.042
that "abroad" does not really exist.

25:36.126 --> 25:37.751
Does not really exist.
Does not really exist.

25:41.334 --> 25:43.792
I was earning money
from American publishers,

25:43.876 --> 25:46.292
<i>and I bought an old battered Ford car.</i>

25:46.376 --> 25:48.917
Mayakovsky had a Renault,
and we raced around Moscow

25:49.001 --> 25:51.667
at 40 miles an hour with our windows down,

25:51.751 --> 25:53.042
shouting, singing,

25:53.126 --> 25:54.826
and mooning.

25:55.209 --> 25:58.084
He had a nice arse.
My arse was way too fat.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.959
He got his car impounded for moral turpitude.

26:01.042 --> 26:02.376
Mayakovsky, that is, not his car.

26:02.459 --> 26:03.584
His car was innocent.

26:03.834 --> 26:06.709
Is this car, with Death in the driver's seat,

26:06.792 --> 26:07.834
completely innocent?

26:08.001 --> 26:09.501
No fat on his backside.

26:09.626 --> 26:13.001
In 1927, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks

26:13.126 --> 26:15.417
of Universal Pictures,
Charlie Chaplin's company,

26:15.501 --> 26:18.251
<i>saw Potemkin and invited me
to come to Hollywood</i>

26:18.334 --> 26:20.209
to make a film! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

26:21.584 --> 26:24.417
I met them all. All those Hollywood guys.

26:24.501 --> 26:26.209
They all came to Moscow.
Would you believe it?

26:26.417 --> 26:28.167
<i>Joseph Schenck lost in Russia,</i>

26:28.292 --> 26:30.376
but he looked like a Russian smoothie.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.792
All Jews look lost in Russia,

26:31.876 --> 26:33.626
but there is never a better home for them.

26:33.709 --> 26:36.709
He fast-smoked big cigars.
He was a caricature.

26:36.834 --> 26:38.626
It was to make sure no one took him seriously

26:38.709 --> 26:41.042
so he could take everyone else seriously
when they weren't looking.

26:41.459 --> 26:44.126
I am a caricature. I don't smoke fast,

26:44.209 --> 26:45.709
but I can talk fast, don't you think?

26:45.792 --> 26:48.417
Joseph Schenck came
with a Hollywood contract

26:48.501 --> 26:51.251
in his pocket, which was soon in my pocket.

26:51.376 --> 26:55.126
And then my pockets were filled
with Hollywood happiness.

26:55.709 --> 26:57.792
<i>Felicidad Hollywoodus.</i>

27:03.917 --> 27:06.501
To get to Hollywood,
you must first pass through Europe,

27:06.584 --> 27:08.709
and then you have to pass through America

27:08.792 --> 27:12.376
because Hollywood is a separate country
all on its very own.

27:12.792 --> 27:14.626
So like bug-eyed cultural tourists,

27:14.709 --> 27:18.792
we went through Europe,
looking, seeing, shaking hands.

27:18.876 --> 27:20.876
Although it was more like
shaking hands and looking.

27:20.959 --> 27:24.042
I had eyes in my hands,
and they never stopped shaking.

27:24.126 --> 27:29.084
We met George Grosz and Man Ray
and Dos Passes.

27:29.167 --> 27:30.751
Oh, Käthe Kollwitz.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.667
She had at least half a way
for social conscience,

27:32.751 --> 27:34.876
though her droopy face and sagging breasts

27:35.001 --> 27:36.626
were overplayed as a sort of trademark.

27:36.709 --> 27:39.626
And Le Corbusier,
who said I reminded him of Donatello.

27:39.709 --> 27:41.417
All architects love cinema.

27:42.459 --> 27:46.709
We met Léger and Cocteau and Marinetti,
who was a fool.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.459
Terrible poetry, worse painting.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.501
Oh, we met James Joyce,

27:50.584 --> 27:52.376
who sat through <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>

27:52.459 --> 27:53.876
in his dark blind glasses.

27:53.959 --> 27:55.126
I imagine he did not see a thing.

27:55.209 --> 27:57.542
We met Abel Gance and Buñuel.

27:57.626 --> 28:01.792
And Al Jolson, the blacked-up
singing son of a Russian rabbi.

28:01.917 --> 28:03.059
This one.

28:04.542 --> 28:09.084
We saw Dalí's <i>Le Chien Andalou</i>
and Dreyer's <i>Joan of Arc.</i>

28:09.167 --> 28:11.876
I went to Holland, where a crowd of reporters

28:11.959 --> 28:13.292
<i>met me at Rotterdam airport.</i>

28:13.376 --> 28:14.542
They were all very excited.

28:14.751 --> 28:18.001
They had come expecting to meet Einstein.

28:19.834 --> 28:22.501
We had von Sternberg in Babelsberg.

28:22.584 --> 28:25.001
And he was shooting <i>The Blue Angel</i>
with Marlene Dietrich.

28:26.709 --> 28:29.084
We were all the time
being watched and followed

28:29.167 --> 28:32.667
by two Russian agents.

28:32.751 --> 28:34.542
One looked like Fatty Arbuckle

28:34.626 --> 28:36.292
and the other one looked like Buster Keaton.

28:36.376 --> 28:38.792
One was rosy and laughing
and always fingering his backside,

28:38.876 --> 28:40.084
the other solemn and sad,

28:40.167 --> 28:42.134
as though he had wet his trousers.

28:42.959 --> 28:46.376
Dorothy Gish and her sister
wanted me to make a film,

28:46.459 --> 28:48.876
but sentimental melodrama is not my hat.

28:48.959 --> 28:51.126
Too much gushing and gishing, no irony.

28:51.209 --> 28:54.626
I sent them to Pudovkin.
He is good at tears and whey.

28:54.709 --> 28:57.876
He said, "If I was no good
at treating American ladies well,

28:57.959 --> 28:59.709
"I was nothing. What are you?" he said.

28:59.792 --> 29:04.126
I replied, "I am a scientific dilettante
with encyclopaedic interests."

29:31.001 --> 29:33.834
We left Moscow
just as the ceiling was falling in.

29:33.917 --> 29:36.917
Pasternak and Mayakovsky
were forbidden to leave.

29:37.001 --> 29:38.667
Passports forbidden.

29:38.751 --> 29:40.501
Trotsky was deported to Turkey.

29:40.626 --> 29:42.626
Poets, painters, and publishers

29:42.709 --> 29:45.584
were sacked, spitted,
sat upon, and spat upon.

29:45.667 --> 29:48.459
We felt the flames up our bums,
red-hot pokers up our asses

29:48.542 --> 29:51.834
as we fled to America.
It scorched us out of Russia.

29:51.917 --> 29:55.959
And I had Joey Schenck's invite
in my back trouser pocket,

29:56.042 --> 29:58.209
resting against my right buttock.

29:58.292 --> 30:01.251
An invite to Hollywood.

30:07.626 --> 30:09.001
Excuse me, sir,

30:09.084 --> 30:12.126
I see you are being protected by grandmothers.

30:21.459 --> 30:23.626
And then came the bad news.

30:23.709 --> 30:25.501
Keep out the Red Peril!

30:25.584 --> 30:28.459
These Russians will rape and abuse
our American children!

30:28.584 --> 30:30.751
The biggest shark in the shark tank

30:30.834 --> 30:33.167
was an American Senator, Hamilton Fish,

30:33.251 --> 30:34.876
Redneck Extraordinaire.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.459
And behind sharkman Senator Fish

30:37.542 --> 30:39.334
was the riot-master Major Frank Pease.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.876
<i>The bad meat-man in</i> Battleship Potemkin.

30:41.959 --> 30:45.042
I could well have been accused
of sacrilege, insulting God.

30:45.126 --> 30:47.834
I was the "Roosian" Eisenstein,
the Messenger from Hell.

30:48.001 --> 30:49.001
And they won.

30:49.626 --> 30:53.292
Paramount Pictures
could not afford the bad publicity.

30:54.084 --> 30:56.292
Paramount Pictures pictured me

30:56.376 --> 30:59.334
<i>with everyone American
American they could find</i>

30:59.417 --> 31:02.751
to bolster me up,
to keep my image squeaky clean.

31:02.834 --> 31:05.584
I shook hands with Walt Disney,

31:05.667 --> 31:07.626
the greatest and only true filmmaker

31:07.709 --> 31:09.417
who starts from an absolutely clean slate.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.751
Oh, and I met his apprentice-assistant

31:11.834 --> 31:13.959
and protégé, Mickey Mouse

31:14.042 --> 31:16.376
and I rubbed wet noses with Rin Tin Tin.

31:16.459 --> 31:17.667
But in the end...

31:18.834 --> 31:20.542
They could not afford to hold out.

31:20.626 --> 31:22.417
They gave in. They caved in.

31:22.542 --> 31:25.042
They were getting jumpy and jittery.

31:25.126 --> 31:26.501
Said it was the Depression.

31:26.584 --> 31:28.376
Said they had to weather the storm.

31:28.459 --> 31:29.501
Said it was the rains.

31:29.584 --> 31:31.501
And when the rains had passed,
they would call me back.

31:31.584 --> 31:33.876
So exit Eisenstein.

31:33.959 --> 31:37.917
Jew. Red. Troublemaker. Communist.

31:38.459 --> 31:40.834
And then I met Upton Sinclair

31:40.917 --> 31:43.167
and came here to Mexico
to meet you, Palomino,

31:43.251 --> 31:44.501
and Palomino's wife

31:44.584 --> 31:46.792
and Palomino's two small children.

31:46.876 --> 31:48.792
Who should be in bed.

31:48.876 --> 31:50.709
So where do I sleep tonight?

31:50.792 --> 31:52.751
- I cannot sleep naked.
- Why not?

31:52.834 --> 31:54.042
Because I have never slept naked,

31:54.126 --> 31:55.709
except last night when you stole my clothes.

31:55.792 --> 31:57.584
My mother didn't like it.
I didn't like it.

31:57.667 --> 31:59.167
Someone could have stolen my virginity

31:59.251 --> 32:00.959
when I lay there sleeping naked.

32:01.042 --> 32:03.042
- Virginity?
- I was joking.

32:04.584 --> 32:06.959
- Do you have a nightshirt?
- No.

32:07.042 --> 32:08.876
My wife has a nightgown.

32:08.959 --> 32:10.292
Let me borrow your nightgown.

32:11.076 --> 32:12.042
Why not?

32:12.126 --> 32:15.876
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

32:15.959 --> 32:19.084
<i>How I wonder where you are</i>

32:19.667 --> 32:23.459
<i>Up above the world so high</i>

32:23.542 --> 32:26.292
<i>Like a diamond in the sky</i>

32:34.292 --> 32:35.417
Good, Pascal.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.584
There are no flies on me.

32:57.876 --> 33:00.584
Those flies again.
Are they still Russian flies?

33:02.709 --> 33:05.667
They are preparing themselves, getting ready,

33:05.751 --> 33:08.251
assembling to devour my putrefying flesh.

33:09.584 --> 33:12.292
<i>Flies and maggots.</i>

33:12.376 --> 33:16.626
<i>I'm familiar with maggots,
Battleship Potemkin maggots.</i>

33:16.709 --> 33:19.251
- Knock, knock, who's there?
- Only Death.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.001
Death is so close here in the hot sun.

33:25.084 --> 33:26.751
He's tapping me on the shoulder.

33:27.167 --> 33:29.209
In Russia, we hide Death away.

33:29.959 --> 33:31.459
Make him a distant villain.

33:32.626 --> 33:35.584
Here, Death is very close,

33:35.667 --> 33:37.542
and a friendly hero.

33:37.626 --> 33:39.709
She greets us at the cemetery gate

33:39.792 --> 33:41.709
and walks with us politely.

33:43.126 --> 33:45.042
We walk with Death in the cemetery

33:45.126 --> 33:46.417
under the same parasol.

33:46.501 --> 33:48.167
We benefit from the same shadow.

33:48.792 --> 33:50.917
Better that Death is a friend,

33:51.001 --> 33:52.376
not a stranger.

33:58.001 --> 33:59.126
Lenin is dead.

34:00.751 --> 34:02.751
So is Karl Marx.

34:02.834 --> 34:05.417
Both died in their beds.

34:07.876 --> 34:11.458
Jesus Christ is dead. 
He was crucified.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.251
And Saint Peter,
he was crucified upside down.

34:15.876 --> 34:19.876
And Cortés and Pizarro

34:19.958 --> 34:21.751
and Torquemada is dead.

34:24.626 --> 34:26.083
Moctezuma is dead.

34:29.126 --> 34:31.333
And George Washington is dead.

34:31.417 --> 34:34.667
And Abraham Lincoln is dead. 
He was shot.

34:37.251 --> 34:39.751
Pancho Villa is dead. 
He was shot.

34:41.458 --> 34:43.501
And Zapata is dead. 
He was shot.

34:45.792 --> 34:48.126
And Benito Pablo Juárez is dead.

34:50.542 --> 34:53.542
Miguel Hidalgo, he is dead. 
He was shot.

34:55.626 --> 34:58.542
I once played Leonardo da Vinci

34:58.626 --> 35:02.792
dying in the arms of Francois I at Amboise.

35:04.334 --> 35:05.917
Eisenstein will die...

35:07.792 --> 35:08.917
Like Leonardo.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.042
I'm not so sure

35:12.126 --> 35:14.251
that filmmakers will be remembered.

35:16.667 --> 35:19.751
We have made a procession
of the mighty dead.

35:23.126 --> 35:24.709
Aren't you surprised that we spend

35:24.792 --> 35:27.417
so much time making people die in films?

35:28.042 --> 35:32.584
All actors, sooner or later,
and sooner rather than later,

35:32.667 --> 35:35.167
in theatres and cinemas around the world

35:35.292 --> 35:37.751
are asked to fuck or die.

35:38.876 --> 35:43.501
Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth,

35:43.584 --> 35:47.667
<i>Juliet, Madame Butterfly,
Joan of Arc, Yevgeniy Onegin,</i>

35:47.751 --> 35:51.584
<i>Cleopatra, Julius Caesar,
Savonarola, Helen of Troy,</i>

35:51.667 --> 35:52.751
<i>Ivan the Terrible...</i>

35:52.834 --> 35:56.751
We give you licence to show us
people fucking and dying,

35:56.834 --> 35:59.126
and we know they are not.

35:59.209 --> 36:00.959
And you know they are not.

36:01.042 --> 36:04.376
And we know that you know
that we know they are not.

36:06.292 --> 36:09.834
It's all to prove we are alive twice over.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.626
First as an affirmation

36:12.709 --> 36:15.584
and then as a challenge

36:15.667 --> 36:17.167
to Death itself.

36:18.001 --> 36:20.709
The willing and very necessary

36:20.792 --> 36:23.417
suspension of disbelief.

36:25.751 --> 36:28.334
In modern-day Russia,

36:28.417 --> 36:32.417
Death comes drunk in a crumpled
dark-grey suit with no underwear

36:32.501 --> 36:35.376
because no one has money
for vests and underpants in Russia.

36:36.084 --> 36:39.417
He wears a second-hand grubby white shirt

36:39.501 --> 36:41.834
with no collar and dirty cuffs.

36:41.959 --> 36:44.959
Death in Russia
is a shabby meeting at life's end.

36:45.959 --> 36:47.751
Here in Mexico,

36:47.834 --> 36:51.792
Death comes bright-eyed
and laughing, totally sober,

36:52.376 --> 36:54.376
beginning his greatest adventure,

36:54.459 --> 36:55.626
kissing the air.

36:57.209 --> 36:59.501
His head, his heart,

37:00.876 --> 37:03.334
and his cock held high.

37:03.459 --> 37:07.501
Sex and death, the two non-negotiables.

37:07.917 --> 37:10.167
Eros and Thanatos.

37:11.084 --> 37:13.917
We are never aware of our own conception.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.459
Can we really be a witness to our own death?

37:19.292 --> 37:21.751
You have introduced yourself
to Death in México.

37:22.542 --> 37:25.209
Indeed, you seem to me
to have introduced yourself

37:25.292 --> 37:26.501
to Death in México.

37:27.042 --> 37:28.126
Perhaps now you need

37:28.209 --> 37:29.834
to introduce yourself to sex in México?

37:31.751 --> 37:34.376
Well, perhaps now I need to introduce myself

37:34.459 --> 37:35.501
to sex in the world.

37:38.167 --> 37:39.834
Perhaps, Cañedo, you could introduce me

37:39.917 --> 37:41.876
to sex in Mexico and the world?

37:46.459 --> 37:49.334
<i>Another subject matter
could be money.</i>

37:50.001 --> 37:51.001
Money?

37:52.334 --> 37:54.292
I am not so sure at all about money.

37:55.209 --> 37:58.167
It has not been around for so very long.

37:58.251 --> 38:01.501
And now so many fools have it
and so many wise men do not.

38:01.584 --> 38:03.084
It cannot be very important.

38:03.834 --> 38:06.876
And money can be so easily subsumed

38:06.959 --> 38:09.334
into death and sex,

38:09.417 --> 38:13.126
if only to delay one and pay for the other.

38:16.126 --> 38:19.126
Another subject matter could be power.

38:20.417 --> 38:22.959
You will have to go back to Russia
sooner or later.

38:23.042 --> 38:26.292
And in Russia,
you will witness power unlimited.

38:28.084 --> 38:32.334
Every morning there is a flood
of yellow telegrams

38:32.417 --> 38:34.376
pushed under my door.

38:34.459 --> 38:36.751
<i>They want me back in Russia.</i>

38:36.834 --> 38:40.001
<i>Russian power reaches its huge hand</i>

38:40.084 --> 38:41.584
<i>here to me in Mexico.</i>

38:43.667 --> 38:44.876
<i>Can anyone escape it?</i>

38:46.667 --> 38:48.501
Now we sleep for one hour.

38:52.626 --> 38:53.834
Enjoy your siesta.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.792
A siesta splits the day in two.

38:57.876 --> 39:00.001
Makes two days out of one.

39:00.084 --> 39:02.292
But really, you must do it properly.

39:02.376 --> 39:03.417
Undress,

39:03.501 --> 39:04.959
and the most important thing of all,

39:05.667 --> 39:08.334
sleep between cool sheets.

39:08.417 --> 39:09.959
No snoozing in your day clothes.

39:10.917 --> 39:14.334
You must be naturally drowsy.

39:14.417 --> 39:18.251
Give in. The best sleep of the day.

39:22.042 --> 39:23.292
Drift away.

39:26.709 --> 39:28.209
Then you go to bed.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.084
And pretend you are dead.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.167
Silent.

39:38.542 --> 39:39.542
Still.

39:41.084 --> 39:44.542
The best sleep you will know
when you are not dead.

39:44.709 --> 39:46.126
And you are cheating death.

39:50.042 --> 39:51.792
Go on, take your clothes off.

40:11.792 --> 40:14.334
I have a clumsy, unattractive body.

40:14.667 --> 40:17.542
It's not unattractive. I have seen it.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.084
You make it unattractive.

40:20.167 --> 40:24.459
Your belief in your ugliness
is a sort of exhibitionism.

40:24.542 --> 40:26.459
You are vain about your ugliness.

40:26.542 --> 40:28.626
I have a coward's bravery.

40:30.751 --> 40:32.917
Short arms, big head,

40:34.209 --> 40:35.292
big feet.

40:36.501 --> 40:40.001
I have the correct physiognomy for a clown.

40:41.167 --> 40:43.709
No woman could ever take
a delight in my body.

40:43.792 --> 40:46.167
Why not? Clowns are loved by women.

40:47.001 --> 40:50.959
Their helpless foolishness is appealing.

40:53.292 --> 40:55.792
Is that really the problem, do you think?

40:55.876 --> 40:58.834
That you have believed that no woman
could approve of your body?

40:59.834 --> 41:00.834
Or your prick?

41:02.251 --> 41:03.792
So you have denied them.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.501
I have a prick only fit for peeing.

41:21.001 --> 41:23.376
That could be very usefully true.

41:23.459 --> 41:24.876
But it cannot be all.

41:26.126 --> 41:27.376
Make it rise.

41:33.459 --> 41:36.209
You see? It takes on a brand-new life.

41:36.834 --> 41:37.834
Respect it.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.667
I am not going to deny myself sleep any more.

41:47.792 --> 41:50.792
We will discuss your prick later
when we wake up.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.584
Now take a shower and lay down.

41:57.167 --> 42:00.084
I am already falling over the cliff

42:00.167 --> 42:01.667
into the abyss of sleep.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.376
This is really the way to fall into this.

42:07.334 --> 42:08.376
Delightful.

42:09.917 --> 42:11.209
Guiltless.

42:13.792 --> 42:15.042
Unfatigued.

42:16.459 --> 42:19.459
This way, you will not dream.

42:23.042 --> 42:25.334
I never dream during a siesta.

42:43.167 --> 42:45.334
Pera? Pera?

42:45.417 --> 42:46.501
Is that you?

42:46.584 --> 42:50.084
- <i>What's that noise?</i>
- I'm in the shower.

42:50.167 --> 42:51.376
Water. Warm rain.

42:52.167 --> 42:56.542
I am in Guanajuato,
and there is a man in my bed.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.834
- <i>What is he doing there?</i>
- Sleeping.

42:59.917 --> 43:02.126
It's early afternoon. Siesta time.

43:02.209 --> 43:04.542
We should learn to take siestas in Moscow.

43:04.626 --> 43:06.167
What are you doing?

43:06.251 --> 43:08.209
<i>What should I be doing here in Moscow?</i>

43:08.292 --> 43:10.959
<i>Nothing much, writing invoices,</i>

43:11.042 --> 43:12.917
<i>typing scripts for the publisher,</i>

43:13.001 --> 43:14.584
<i>being your secretary,</i>

43:14.667 --> 43:17.709
<i>looking after your interests
whilst you're away,</i>

43:17.792 --> 43:20.417
<i>refusing chocolates and visits
to the cinema from Boris.</i>

43:20.501 --> 43:23.584
Pera, why don't you drop everything

43:23.667 --> 43:24.876
and come to Mexico

43:25.334 --> 43:28.334
and rescue me from men
falling asleep in my bed?

43:28.417 --> 43:29.959
<i>I could never get a visa.</i>

43:30.042 --> 43:31.959
<i>And there is no money for foreign visits.</i>

43:32.042 --> 43:34.959
We have shot over 70 miles of film, 20 hours.

43:35.042 --> 43:36.792
I have a lot of ideas,
though they keep changing.

43:36.876 --> 43:39.251
Usual stuff. It's gonna be a great film.

43:39.334 --> 43:41.459
<i>People here are saying you won't come back.</i>

43:42.126 --> 43:44.334
Of course I'm coming back.

43:44.417 --> 43:46.751
<i>Sergei, be careful.</i>

43:46.834 --> 43:49.084
<i>Don't get mad at me,
but your American experience</i>

43:49.167 --> 43:50.542
<i>could act against you.</i>

43:50.667 --> 43:52.334
<i>They've stopped paying your mother.</i>

43:52.667 --> 43:55.251
<i>Don't worry,
I'm getting something through to her,</i>

43:55.334 --> 43:58.501
<i>though she continues to be very rude
and condescending to me,</i>

43:58.584 --> 44:00.084
<i>the bitch.</i>

44:00.167 --> 44:01.209
<i>Sorry.</i>

44:01.292 --> 44:03.501
<i>You know there is no love lost between us.</i>

44:04.084 --> 44:07.126
His name is Cañedo.

44:07.209 --> 44:08.834
<i>Whose name?</i>

44:08.917 --> 44:10.917
The man in my bed. He's my guide.

44:11.792 --> 44:13.709
<i>And what else is he to you?</i>

44:13.959 --> 44:16.084
He's an instructor

44:16.167 --> 44:18.876
of comparative religion.

44:18.959 --> 44:21.751
<i>Since when have you needed
instruction in religion?</i>

44:22.417 --> 44:26.126
We talk about Mexico and death.

44:26.334 --> 44:28.084
He's my guide to the Underworld.

44:30.251 --> 44:33.209
Pera? Pera? Are you still there?

44:33.292 --> 44:34.334
The line is very bad.

44:34.501 --> 44:36.459
<i>I hear all sorts of noises,</i>

44:36.542 --> 44:39.167
<i>like someone banging a hammer on metal.</i>

44:39.251 --> 44:40.959
<i>A spanner on a radiator.</i>

44:41.209 --> 44:43.417
No, that's here, upstairs or somewhere.

44:44.042 --> 44:47.292
<i>Sergei, think of yourself.
Think of coming back soon.</i>

44:47.876 --> 44:49.501
<i>They are starting to ask even little me</i>

44:49.584 --> 44:51.334
<i>all sorts of questions, like,</i>

44:51.417 --> 44:54.001
<i>"What do the Americans think of Sergei?"</i>

44:54.084 --> 44:57.084
<i>Using your first name,
suggesting we are intimate.</i>

44:57.584 --> 44:59.001
I'm not with Americans any more.

44:59.084 --> 45:02.292
I'm with Mexicans,
an entirely different race of people.

45:04.209 --> 45:07.001
Pera? Pera? Pera, are you there?

45:07.084 --> 45:08.792
<i>You are a long way off.</i>

45:09.876 --> 45:12.334
You're right. I'm in Mexico.

45:26.584 --> 45:28.417
It is 9:45,

45:28.501 --> 45:31.417
a quarter to 10:00 on the 25th October.

45:31.501 --> 45:34.209
The official time we stormed
the Winter Palace.

45:34.292 --> 45:37.584
14 years to the minute
when the Revolution began.

45:37.667 --> 45:40.542
Ten days that shook the world.

45:41.959 --> 45:44.042
Except we have now changed calendars,

45:44.126 --> 45:45.667
and it's all happening in November.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.542
And anyway, if it's 9:45 here in Mexico,

45:48.626 --> 45:51.126
it can't be 9:45 in Moscow.

45:51.209 --> 45:54.251
The anniversary was over ten hours ago.
We missed it.

45:54.334 --> 45:56.501
Then Eisenstein did it all over again.

45:57.126 --> 45:59.167
He recreated the Russian Revolution

45:59.251 --> 46:00.417
all over again on film.

46:01.292 --> 46:03.459
Though much bigger and much better

46:03.542 --> 46:04.584
<i>than the first time round.</i>

46:04.751 --> 46:07.667
And twice as expensive.

46:08.084 --> 46:10.959
With Eisenstein's version,
the street cleaners complained.

46:11.251 --> 46:15.292
<i>They took three days
cleaning up the broken glass.</i>

46:15.376 --> 46:16.626
"The first time around," they said,

46:16.709 --> 46:19.084
"People were more considerate.

46:19.167 --> 46:20.834
<i>"They made far less mess."</i>

46:20.917 --> 46:23.042
They thought the first revolution

46:23.126 --> 46:24.709
<i>was, was better choreographed.</i>

46:24.792 --> 46:27.334
They thought Eisenstein's version
wasn't worth filming.

46:27.417 --> 46:30.209
It was a waste of film, they said.

46:30.292 --> 46:33.084
<i>With Eisenstein, there were
much more windows broken,</i>

46:33.167 --> 46:35.501
more statues chipped by ricocheting bullets,

46:35.584 --> 46:36.834
and much more noise.

46:37.501 --> 46:40.126
The original revolution had apparently been

46:40.209 --> 46:41.417
a fairly quiet affair,

46:41.792 --> 46:44.376
with no swearing and no bad language.

47:05.959 --> 47:09.626
Eisenstein is very equivocal about women.

47:10.959 --> 47:13.792
And he really is a vulgar, fat little chap.

47:14.959 --> 47:17.834
Any opportunity to pass on obscenity,

47:17.959 --> 47:19.751
he will fart it through.

47:19.834 --> 47:21.584
Sublimated sexual frustration.

47:23.042 --> 47:24.751
He can be very crude about women.

47:26.292 --> 47:28.751
He can't do the sex, so he'll talk it.

47:29.501 --> 47:32.459
Come on, let's take the young woman home.

47:46.251 --> 47:47.667
A present,

47:47.751 --> 47:49.834
so you can celebrate your Russian Revolution

47:49.917 --> 47:51.334
far from home.

47:51.417 --> 47:54.626
Congratulations, Mr Russian Film Director.

47:55.209 --> 47:56.376
Thank you.

47:56.459 --> 47:58.876
I will wave it and remember.

50:02.167 --> 50:03.251
Turn around.

50:33.001 --> 50:34.667
Initiation ceremony.

50:38.209 --> 50:42.001
Formal initiation into life
was essential for the Aztecs,

50:42.084 --> 50:43.292
a full ritual.

50:44.334 --> 50:46.626
You have left it a little late, Sergei.

50:46.709 --> 50:49.584
But doesn't matter. 
Better late than never.

50:50.667 --> 50:52.084
Better never late.

50:53.542 --> 50:55.292
You are far from home

50:55.376 --> 50:57.459
and off your home initiation ground.

50:59.042 --> 51:00.084
I cannot.

51:00.167 --> 51:01.667
Cannot what?

51:03.042 --> 51:04.042
Why not?

51:04.917 --> 51:07.001
Because I have argued with myself repeatedly

51:07.084 --> 51:08.751
that this cannot be the way.

51:10.167 --> 51:12.834
I have reached my accustomed point,

51:12.917 --> 51:14.251
and this is where I stop.

51:15.542 --> 51:19.084
It used to be where you may have stopped.

51:20.667 --> 51:22.084
It isn't any longer.

51:23.751 --> 51:25.542
This is where I get off the train.

51:25.926 --> 51:27.792
Sorry, no station.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.251
Well, then I will have to jump.

51:31.292 --> 51:34.042
Jumping off a moving train
could be dangerous.

51:35.292 --> 51:38.001
And your prick tells you

51:38.084 --> 51:41.417
you have a first-class ticket
to continue the journey.

51:42.501 --> 51:47.417
My prick is a stowaway,
an even sadder clown than me.

51:47.501 --> 51:49.292
He wears a sad clown's helmet.

51:50.792 --> 51:53.542
He's a wiser clown than you.

51:53.626 --> 51:55.209
Follow where he leads.

51:56.709 --> 51:58.126
And if you won't lead,

51:59.334 --> 52:00.334
let me.

52:02.084 --> 52:03.292
I am the guard.

52:05.126 --> 52:07.751
I will be at the back of the train.

52:58.167 --> 52:59.626
It hurts, it stings!

52:59.709 --> 53:00.792
I'm going to vomit!

53:04.834 --> 53:06.542
That's what every virgin must say.

53:07.626 --> 53:09.917
That's what the virginal New World said.

53:13.292 --> 53:15.667
- I'm bleeding.
- So you are.

53:16.709 --> 53:18.376
Every virgin is supposed to bleed,

53:18.459 --> 53:21.167
so you were perhaps telling me the truth.

53:22.126 --> 53:23.351
Don't worry.

53:23.834 --> 53:25.959
Small, broken, injured capillaries

53:26.626 --> 53:29.709
in the sensitive anal interior sphincter.

53:29.792 --> 53:31.834
Recovery almost immediate.

53:32.084 --> 53:35.709
- Bleeding makes me vulnerable.
- It does.

53:36.834 --> 53:39.292
But you have no reason to feel concerned.

53:39.376 --> 53:40.876
Unless you are a haemophiliac.

53:41.959 --> 53:43.876
You are not a member
of the Russian royal family,

53:43.959 --> 53:45.167
are you?

53:45.251 --> 53:46.459
Are you a Romanov?

53:48.876 --> 53:52.084
Europe gave México many things.

53:52.167 --> 53:55.459
And perhaps México
gave only one thing back,

53:56.042 --> 53:57.042
syphilis.

53:58.667 --> 54:01.334
It was known for a time
as the "Mexican disease."

54:01.417 --> 54:03.084
Then as the "Spanish disease."

54:03.167 --> 54:06.042
The Spanish gave it to Italians
in southern Italy.

54:06.126 --> 54:10.334
The French army of Francis I
caught it from the Italians.

54:11.417 --> 54:12.917
Then it was the "French Disease."

54:13.334 --> 54:15.667
The French soldiers took it back to France.

54:15.751 --> 54:18.709
And then it was everybody's.

54:19.792 --> 54:22.292
The Mexicans had a natural immunity?

54:22.376 --> 54:24.334
Is that really true?

54:24.459 --> 54:26.917
The Old World, the New World.

54:27.001 --> 54:29.417
You are the Old World. I am the New World.

54:30.501 --> 54:33.042
But we have it all the wrong way round.

54:33.126 --> 54:34.251
México,

54:34.334 --> 54:35.959
pre-Columbian Middle America,

54:37.292 --> 54:38.501
is the Old World.

54:39.167 --> 54:41.542
Where you come from is the New World.

54:41.626 --> 54:43.417
And you tell me all these things

54:43.501 --> 54:45.959
while your prick is in my arse?

54:49.334 --> 54:50.542
Could be the reason.

54:52.334 --> 54:54.376
Could be an excuse.

54:55.917 --> 54:57.876
Could be a justification

54:57.959 --> 55:00.084
to remind you about subjugation.

55:03.126 --> 55:05.417
But it could be none of those things at all.

55:05.834 --> 55:06.917
And it isn't.

55:09.292 --> 55:11.126
And you are not entirely unwilling.

55:13.709 --> 55:16.376
Curiously, neither were the Aztecs.

55:18.126 --> 55:20.709
The European invasion had been prophesied.

55:20.792 --> 55:24.542
They were God-fearing, superstitious people.

55:24.626 --> 55:27.126
They did not resist.

55:27.209 --> 55:30.709
The new New World should learn from the old.

55:33.751 --> 55:37.209
They say all Americans, north and south,

55:37.292 --> 55:40.792
originally came across
the Bering Straits to Alaska

55:40.876 --> 55:44.459
and then all the way down

55:44.542 --> 55:46.001
to Tierra del Fuego.

55:47.751 --> 55:51.126
If the original Americans came that way,

55:52.667 --> 55:56.042
they must have travelled
originally from Siberia,

55:56.126 --> 55:58.667
which means all Americans,

55:59.209 --> 56:01.751
and that also means all Mexicans,

56:01.834 --> 56:04.926
were once upon a time Russians.

56:06.626 --> 56:07.876
And now, Sergei,

56:09.501 --> 56:13.834
I want to enjoy your virginal Russian arse.

56:43.417 --> 56:44.709
At 2:00,

56:45.251 --> 56:48.876
on the 26th of October, 1917,

56:50.709 --> 56:52.834
the Russian Revolution was over.

56:54.042 --> 56:56.917
The Winter Palace had been taken.

56:58.584 --> 57:00.959
I was 19.

57:01.751 --> 57:05.334
Congratulations, Eisenstein, on a revolution.

57:07.292 --> 57:11.792
14 years ago, Russia lost its virginity.

57:12.917 --> 57:17.959
I was 14 years too late.

58:43.751 --> 58:45.709
Sergei, there has been a mudslide

58:45.792 --> 58:46.917
to the south of the city,

58:47.001 --> 58:48.209
the heavy rains last night.

58:48.292 --> 58:50.042
There are many dead, many injured.

58:50.126 --> 58:51.292
We should go there

58:51.376 --> 58:53.917
and film a natural Mexican disaster.

58:54.001 --> 58:55.334
Is there such a thing?

58:55.417 --> 58:57.334
Aren't all disasters natural?

58:57.501 --> 58:59.834
Hey, come on, get your clothes on.

59:00.792 --> 59:02.667
It's not time for idle philosophy.

59:03.376 --> 59:04.834
Hey, come and help.

59:05.334 --> 59:06.876
Come and tell us how we should film it.

59:06.959 --> 59:08.792
No, you do it. You know what to do.

59:08.876 --> 59:11.084
I'm not so good with reality.
I'm going back to bed.

59:11.167 --> 59:14.209
We have the car outside.
We can be there in 20 minutes

59:14.292 --> 59:15.626
if the roads are not washed away.

59:15.709 --> 59:18.917
The local people will not like
you seeing them distressed.

59:19.001 --> 59:21.167
You are vultures. 
You will not be popular.

59:21.251 --> 59:24.751
Sergei, we can record it,
show what happened.

59:24.917 --> 59:25.917
You go, I'll come later.

01:00:17.001 --> 01:00:18.959
Having children of my own

01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.876
has just not occurred to me as a possibility.

01:00:20.959 --> 01:00:21.959
Is that strange?

01:00:23.334 --> 01:00:24.334
No.

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:28.209
It seems to be so very, very far

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.084
from what I have ever thought.

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:34.542
You really do have to have
the thought in your head,

01:00:34.626 --> 01:00:35.834
and I never have.

01:00:35.959 --> 01:00:37.292
You need to find the desire.

01:00:37.376 --> 01:00:39.459
And the desire needs to be consummated.

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:43.126
We stake a claim to be human

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:45.376
by continuing the inexorable chain

01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:48.792
on and on and on,
generation after generation,

01:00:48.876 --> 01:00:51.376
father, son, and grandson,

01:00:51.459 --> 01:00:56.042
which means we simply are
in a hopeless relay race,

01:00:56.126 --> 01:00:57.542
permitted to hold the baton

01:00:57.626 --> 01:00:58.959
for a few yards of hectic running,

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:02.417
with me thinking and feeling all the time
that I will default,

01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.376
that I will drop the baton

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:06.584
and disgrace myself

01:01:06.667 --> 01:01:09.751
and the team of an extended family

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:13.001
and, not least, betray the woman
who is bearing the child

01:01:13.084 --> 01:01:14.459
at my request

01:01:14.542 --> 01:01:17.501
and who is far more exhausted than me.

01:01:17.584 --> 01:01:19.334
So better not to enter the race,

01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:21.876
humiliate myself,
and embarrass all around me.

01:01:21.959 --> 01:01:24.251
No, no fotos.

01:01:27.126 --> 01:01:29.626
Cañedo? Cañedo, help me!
This baby is bleeding.

01:01:29.709 --> 01:01:31.376
I thought she was peeing down my leg,
but it's blood.

01:01:31.459 --> 01:01:32.667
Look! Help me.

01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:35.042
I could not face a child
bleeding to death in my lap.

01:01:35.126 --> 01:01:37.501
I only... I only construct death in the cinema.

01:01:37.584 --> 01:01:39.459
I don't make it, cause it.
Get the mother.

01:01:39.542 --> 01:01:41.251
Where is the mother of this child?

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:55.001
I came to Mexico

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.292
a virgin.

01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:02.126
And I leave it debauched.

01:02:06.084 --> 01:02:07.584
My body was a stranger.

01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:12.167
And now it becomes familiar in its...

01:02:13.417 --> 01:02:15.167
sheer vulnerability.

01:02:19.751 --> 01:02:21.334
Come with me to Moscow.

01:02:30.959 --> 01:02:32.459
Impossible.

01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:42.542
I brush away my tears.

01:02:44.626 --> 01:02:46.584
Am I weeping for that child?

01:02:49.209 --> 01:02:50.667
For you?

01:02:52.751 --> 01:02:54.167
For myself?

01:03:04.084 --> 01:03:05.251
You are a hero!

01:03:05.334 --> 01:03:06.376
Mercedes.

01:03:07.751 --> 01:03:09.209
Are you not disturbed

01:03:09.292 --> 01:03:11.001
by the Russian film-director's nakedness?

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:14.626
Not at all. He is not interested in women.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.251
Besides, his photograph is in the papers.

01:03:18.959 --> 01:03:21.459
He does not have long to live now.

01:03:21.542 --> 01:03:24.334
Unless he has a great deal of money.

01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:27.709
And unless he is very lucky.

01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:34.209
Some papers say you are a hero.

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:39.667
This paper says you are responsible

01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:41.084
for a child's death.

01:03:42.709 --> 01:03:44.376
<i>This one says</i>

01:03:44.459 --> 01:03:46.417
you and your wife have just had a row

01:03:46.501 --> 01:03:49.042
about her mother, your mother-in-law.

01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:51.459
And this paper offers you condolences

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:52.584
on the death of your daughter.

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:56.209
<i>It's amazing how you have suddenly acquired</i>

01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:57.917
<i>a Mexican family,</i>

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.792
and the Camorristas don't normally like

01:04:00.876 --> 01:04:01.917
to get their hair wet.

01:04:02.001 --> 01:04:03.667
But they can get nothing out of me.

01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:08.001
There are two people downstairs

01:04:08.084 --> 01:04:09.584
waiting to talk to you.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.042
Shall I ask them to come up?

01:04:11.126 --> 01:04:14.126
Mrs Upton Sinclair and her brother.

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:17.876
Upton Sinclair is famous in Russia.

01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:20.376
All his books have been translated.

01:04:20.459 --> 01:04:24.959
One hundred thousand available
Upton Sinclair books in Moscow.

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:29.334
Read largely by literature snobs.

01:04:31.376 --> 01:04:33.751
Well, when they chopped
my Hollywood contract,

01:04:33.834 --> 01:04:36.042
I couldn't go back to Moscow empty-handed.

01:04:36.126 --> 01:04:38.376
And I'd met the film-director Flaherty,

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:40.376
who made <i>Nanook Of The North,</i>

01:04:40.459 --> 01:04:42.334
and he got me interested in going to Mexico,

01:04:42.417 --> 01:04:43.792
which I must admit wasn't difficult.

01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:45.626
Well, Flaherty makes films

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:47.959
with people who are not actors, like me.

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:49.542
And he convinced me

01:04:49.626 --> 01:04:52.167
I could make a film independently in Mexico

01:04:52.251 --> 01:04:53.334
without actors.

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.584
And when I was in Hollywood,

01:04:58.751 --> 01:04:59.959
and I was lonely,

01:05:01.459 --> 01:05:02.626
and miserable,

01:05:03.792 --> 01:05:05.042
and homesick,

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:09.917
I spent a great deal of time
in the Hollywood bookstore

01:05:10.001 --> 01:05:12.376
and practically bought up
their entire stock of books

01:05:12.459 --> 01:05:13.459
on Mexico.

01:05:14.792 --> 01:05:16.126
The owner of the bookstore,

01:05:16.209 --> 01:05:19.084
who had fought in the Mexican Civil War,

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:22.876
said I could make a film in Mexico for $25,000.

01:05:23.001 --> 01:05:24.209
And I talked to Chaplin,

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:27.501
and he agreed it was a good idea.

01:05:27.584 --> 01:05:30.792
Mexico is fashionable amongst
all Chaplin's left-wing friends

01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:32.126
in California.

01:05:32.209 --> 01:05:34.001
They all have second homes here.

01:05:35.084 --> 01:05:36.584
And Upton Sinclair

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:40.834
was one of these left-wing,
fashionable friends.

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:45.417
He and his horse-riding,

01:05:45.501 --> 01:05:47.709
name-dropping,

01:05:47.792 --> 01:05:50.709
faded Southern belle wife were very excited

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:52.959
that they could assist a Russian filmmaker

01:05:53.042 --> 01:05:54.459
with all the right credentials.

01:05:54.542 --> 01:05:57.084
With all the right credentials.
With all the right credentials.

01:05:57.167 --> 01:06:00.501
Sergei! How are you?

01:06:00.584 --> 01:06:02.876
We have been waiting to see you.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.417
Hunter is worried.

01:06:04.501 --> 01:06:07.584
Palomino, this is Mary Craig Sinclair,

01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:10.084
the wife of Upton Sinclair,
famous American author,

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.334
much published in Russia.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:14.751
Mary, this is Palomino Cañedo.

01:06:14.834 --> 01:06:19.626
My, you're handsome, Mr Palomino.

01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:24.876
Palomino! Sounds like a horse.

01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:30.751
I used to have a beautiful
palomino mare two years ago.

01:06:30.834 --> 01:06:33.792
Tennessee Walking Horse
out of an Appaloosa.

01:06:35.001 --> 01:06:37.709
Are you a stud, Mr Palomino?

01:06:38.709 --> 01:06:41.001
Are you registered at the Jockey Club

01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:43.626
like my palomino, Mr Palomino?

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:48.751
Hunter, shake hands with a beautiful man

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.709
who could have been a horse.

01:06:51.709 --> 01:06:53.792
Oh, we could have some coffee, too.

01:06:55.126 --> 01:06:57.209
Oh, are you the maid?

01:06:57.292 --> 01:06:59.501
Or are you doing for Mr Palomino

01:06:59.584 --> 01:07:03.334
what my Appaloosa did for
the Tennessee Walking Horse?

01:07:04.917 --> 01:07:06.584
Bring us some coffee, will you, dear?

01:07:07.376 --> 01:07:11.459
Sergei, Hunter and I wanted
to know how you are doing,

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.667
how you are getting along.

01:07:15.292 --> 01:07:19.251
We have put your latest film rushes

01:07:19.334 --> 01:07:22.376
through the laboratory in California,

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:23.917
and I must say...

01:07:24.242 --> 01:07:25.834
We all say...

01:07:26.417 --> 01:07:28.417
They are truly splendid.

01:07:30.001 --> 01:07:33.126
Albert says so, and George says so, too.

01:07:34.834 --> 01:07:36.251
I'm sorry.

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:40.501
Albert Einstein and George Bernard Shaw.

01:07:41.376 --> 01:07:45.126
You have shown my rushes
to all these people

01:07:45.209 --> 01:07:46.876
when I have not yet seen them myself?

01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:48.667
Well, you couldn't, could you?

01:07:48.917 --> 01:07:51.792
There are no Mexican laboratories

01:07:51.876 --> 01:07:53.542
worth knowing, are there?

01:07:53.626 --> 01:07:59.001
And we didn't want to disturb
you in your good works

01:07:59.084 --> 01:08:01.867
and your long hours.

01:08:02.667 --> 01:08:06.459
Though, Sergei, it is 10:00 in the morning,

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:08.626
and you are still in your pyjamas.

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:11.267
Yellow pyjamas, no less.

01:08:11.751 --> 01:08:13.876
And in bed having breakfast?

01:08:15.334 --> 01:08:17.001
With your friend.

01:08:19.334 --> 01:08:22.417
Cañedo is my official Guanajuato guide.

01:08:22.501 --> 01:08:24.834
He intends to take me
to Diego's favourite restaurant,

01:08:24.917 --> 01:08:26.084
and I am to meet Frida.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.959
Oh, I'm sorry. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo.

01:08:29.684 --> 01:08:30.709
And then,

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:33.959
since I have been introduced
to the siesta by Cañedo,

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.209
I intend to spend a large part

01:08:36.292 --> 01:08:39.126
of the afternoon in bed, practising it.

01:08:39.209 --> 01:08:42.626
Well, it is good to know
that you are in such safe hands.

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:46.292
But Hunter here has to speak
to you about budgets

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:49.251
and finances and money.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:53.126
You know, you have been
in Mexico for eight months now,

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:55.542
and we only budgeted, as you know, for 12.

01:08:55.626 --> 01:08:57.001
Oh, shall I get the invoices to check?

01:08:57.084 --> 01:08:58.251
Oh, good Lord.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:00.959
Oh, well...

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:03.001
I see it is still quite early for you.

01:09:03.084 --> 01:09:06.251
Oh, yes. I am acclimatizing myself
to local practices,

01:09:06.334 --> 01:09:08.167
many of them imported
from across the border.

01:09:08.251 --> 01:09:10.251
You know? The border with America?

01:09:11.417 --> 01:09:13.792
Russians don't wear pyjamas.

01:09:13.876 --> 01:09:15.959
Even Stalin doesn't wear a pyjama,

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:19.334
but I'm sure that before long,
he might very well do, red ones.

01:09:19.626 --> 01:09:22.626
I am used to wearing a Russian nightshirt

01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:25.126
which can be a cast-off daytime shirt.

01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:27.084
It is usually genderless, and usually,

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:29.959
if you tug it well,
can reach down to your knees

01:09:30.042 --> 01:09:33.251
and even, with some sewing
and some adjustments,

01:09:33.334 --> 01:09:35.167
can be made, when it's really cold,

01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:37.584
to reach down to your ankles.

01:09:38.667 --> 01:09:41.292
Well, we will be going now.

01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:43.417
Hunter can make an appointment with you

01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:46.459
to talk finances and... and rushes.

01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:48.501
Is, is that the right word?

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:51.084
And maybe you could do it
over dinner, Hunter?

01:09:51.167 --> 01:09:52.376
Is that all right?

01:09:54.792 --> 01:09:56.501
Infantile behaviour.

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:06.876
- Something else?
- No, thank you, Mercedes.

01:10:06.959 --> 01:10:08.042
<i>Gracias</i>, Mercedes.

01:10:09.001 --> 01:10:10.667
However, Mercedes,

01:10:11.709 --> 01:10:14.917
you could put your naked elbow

01:10:15.001 --> 01:10:19.334
under the shower
to test the water temperature.

01:10:19.417 --> 01:10:20.576
And...

01:10:20.959 --> 01:10:24.417
Perhaps you could warm up
the lavatory seat for me again.

01:10:24.501 --> 01:10:26.167
Take your knickers down,

01:10:26.251 --> 01:10:28.667
sit on the seat the wrong way around,

01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:32.042
take a pee, and wriggle around a bit.

01:10:33.042 --> 01:10:35.709
Do you really want me to translate that?

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:56.459
Was that wise?

01:10:56.542 --> 01:10:58.751
Wise? Wisdom?

01:11:00.334 --> 01:11:01.417
What is that?

01:11:03.001 --> 01:11:06.042
Learning how to live
with a modicum of happiness

01:11:06.126 --> 01:11:07.667
and no harm to others?

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:14.917
Freud says that there are five things

01:11:15.001 --> 01:11:17.001
essential to a man's happiness

01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:20.001
and if you can get them all perfectly aligned,

01:11:20.084 --> 01:11:22.209
you are extremely fortunate indeed,

01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:27.792
health, work, money,

01:11:27.876 --> 01:11:30.709
sex, and love.

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:33.959
I have my health.

01:11:34.459 --> 01:11:36.834
I have unbounded amounts of work.

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:39.459
Money? As you just heard,

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:40.917
I have a banker, and he has money.

01:11:41.001 --> 01:11:43.751
It's not mine,
but it's in their bank under my name.

01:11:43.834 --> 01:11:45.084
Sex? Well...

01:11:46.501 --> 01:11:49.792
I'm more than agreeably accounted for there.

01:11:49.876 --> 01:11:51.626
And love.

01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:54.834
I have the love of a centaur.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:57.834
Obviously a half a man, half a horse.

01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:58.917
A palomino.

01:11:59.334 --> 01:12:01.792
"A Tennessee Walking Horse.

01:12:01.876 --> 01:12:03.917
"A stud out of an Appaloosa."

01:12:05.084 --> 01:12:09.959
Can you whinny and neigh and snort

01:12:10.042 --> 01:12:12.667
and trample the earth with your hooves?

01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:15.667
I can.

01:12:23.834 --> 01:12:25.084
Stop!

01:12:26.584 --> 01:12:27.917
Stop.

01:13:20.376 --> 01:13:21.417
<i>I am 33,</i>

01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:27.084
<i>the age of Christ and Alexander at death,</i>

01:13:29.751 --> 01:13:33.459
<i>the age St Augustine said
we all go to Heaven.</i>

01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:38.417
It is obvious.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:43.292
I had to come to Mexico to go to Heaven.

01:13:47.626 --> 01:13:49.126
You could have found this

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:54.834
ordinary heaven like most other people at 17.

01:13:55.834 --> 01:13:56.917
I doubt it.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.292
I doubt it very much.

01:13:59.626 --> 01:14:02.917
<i>I doubt that there are many 17-year-olds</i>

01:14:03.001 --> 01:14:05.292
<i>that found Heaven that very first time.</i>

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:08.209
<i>I am certain that I would not have.</i>

01:14:08.292 --> 01:14:10.501
<i>I was callow in all ways,</i>

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:12.584
<i>and it would have been a wasted experience.</i>

01:14:13.251 --> 01:14:15.376
33 is the ideal age,

01:14:15.459 --> 01:14:18.959
old enough to be wise enough to know that 33

01:14:20.334 --> 01:14:22.417
is the probable limit of promise.

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:24.626
After 33, you can no longer claim

01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:27.417
to be a young person of promise any more.

01:14:31.459 --> 01:14:33.209
And at 33, you are still young enough

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:34.376
to have your...

01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:37.459
physical attributes,

01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:38.876
but old enough

01:14:38.959 --> 01:14:42.209
to no longer have them
with vanity or triumphalism.

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:43.376
And...

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:47.751
33 is still young enough
not to be hopelessly cynical

01:14:47.834 --> 01:14:49.584
and resigned to your fate.

01:14:51.584 --> 01:14:54.209
<i>I am discovering everything all at once.</i>

01:14:54.292 --> 01:14:55.542
<i>And the catalyst,</i>

01:14:57.084 --> 01:14:58.667
<i>the catalyst is sex.</i>

01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:04.251
I am just stupidly living

01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:05.709
now in the present.

01:15:07.876 --> 01:15:10.376
I could be fodder for
the Camorrista and not care.

01:15:17.792 --> 01:15:19.042
Someone...

01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:22.459
has opened a door to a...

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:24.834
wet

01:15:24.917 --> 01:15:26.084
and weeping...

01:15:27.751 --> 01:15:29.376
dirty...

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:30.501
hurricane.

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:34.251
Look after little Sergei.

01:15:34.917 --> 01:15:36.709
He is a Russian innocent,

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:38.667
and Russian innocents are the most innocent

01:15:38.751 --> 01:15:40.042
of innocents in the world.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:43.876
You should be in that car, Sergei.

01:15:44.542 --> 01:15:46.126
Keep them under control.

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.709
Stop them from spending needless finances.

01:15:48.792 --> 01:15:50.834
Oh, don't worry. I'm following later.

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:52.167
<i>Señor.</i>

01:15:52.251 --> 01:15:53.959
And they could be better off without me.

01:15:54.042 --> 01:15:57.001
Tisse is a Capuchin monk
with money, doesn't eat.

01:15:57.126 --> 01:15:59.251
And Aleksandrov is so charismatic

01:15:59.334 --> 01:16:01.376
that everyone else pays for his bed and board.

01:16:01.459 --> 01:16:03.584
He could scarcely be a drain
on anyone's resources.

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:06.251
We need to talk.

01:16:10.376 --> 01:16:11.751
Salud!

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:15.834
Sergei, with over 100 miles of film,

01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:19.376
you're going to make a film 20 hours long,

01:16:19.459 --> 01:16:22.042
which is stupid and intolerable.

01:16:23.459 --> 01:16:28.542
Griffith shot 200 miles on <i>Intolerance.</i>

01:16:28.626 --> 01:16:32.626
Von Stroheim shot 100 miles on <i>Greed.</i>

01:16:33.334 --> 01:16:35.126
It is normal to shoot that much,

01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:39.792
and we have a project here
covering the whole of Mexico.

01:16:42.917 --> 01:16:44.626
We are not at all doing badly,

01:16:44.709 --> 01:16:47.251
considering all the language difficulties,

01:16:47.334 --> 01:16:49.876
the extras that don't turn up
or turn up too late,

01:16:49.959 --> 01:16:52.042
the Mexican authorities who, out of the blue,

01:16:52.126 --> 01:16:54.751
when we are all prepared,
deny us permission,

01:16:54.834 --> 01:16:57.584
the exceptional heat
that is making everyone sick,

01:16:57.667 --> 01:17:00.709
then, then the heavy rains,
not known for 20 years,

01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:03.042
and then I fall sick with some mystery disease

01:17:03.126 --> 01:17:06.001
that no one can find a name for, even in Aztec.

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:08.542
And what about this letter

01:17:08.626 --> 01:17:11.251
that Upton sent to the Russians in America,

01:17:11.334 --> 01:17:13.709
saying that the hacienda story's
the only one that makes a film

01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:15.667
that anyone could understand in Hollywood

01:17:15.751 --> 01:17:18.459
and that the rest is just
aimless pretty pictures?

01:17:19.834 --> 01:17:23.209
Upton does not simply understand

01:17:23.292 --> 01:17:27.042
that the film needs to be edited the right way.

01:17:27.126 --> 01:17:29.667
Well, he says the rushes are the same thing

01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.626
- over and over again.
- Jesus!

01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:33.126
That's the way you make a film, god damn it!

01:17:33.209 --> 01:17:34.417
Where have you been?

01:17:34.501 --> 01:17:36.792
We keep shooting till we get it right.

01:17:36.876 --> 01:17:40.542
Not every single retake
is in the goddamn film!

01:17:40.626 --> 01:17:42.917
He said, anyway, at the end of his letter

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:45.084
that he was convinced that it would be

01:17:45.167 --> 01:17:47.709
a beautiful and magnificent work of art.

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:52.334
And, and look what he wrote
to Stalin, "Dear Stalin..."

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:55.542
You don't address the Premier
of the USSR like that.

01:17:55.626 --> 01:17:58.417
Upton did, and he's a writer.

01:17:58.501 --> 01:17:59.917
"You may have heard

01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:03.667
"that I have taken the job
of financing a moving picture,

01:18:03.751 --> 01:18:06.917
"which the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein

01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:08.542
"is making in Mexico.

01:18:08.626 --> 01:18:12.084
"It is going to be extraordinary work

01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:15.042
"and I think will be a revelation

01:18:15.126 --> 01:18:18.167
"of the moving-picture art.

01:18:18.251 --> 01:18:20.042
"Someday you will see the picture

01:18:20.126 --> 01:18:21.626
"which Eisenstein is making

01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:23.917
"and realise that Soviet technique

01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:26.292
"has advanced another step

01:18:26.376 --> 01:18:30.376
"and been crowned with fresh laurels."

01:18:30.459 --> 01:18:32.542
Well, I'm not sure what else
he wrote in that letter,

01:18:32.626 --> 01:18:34.334
but he must have provoked Stalin somehow,

01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:36.459
because this is what he telegrammed

01:18:36.542 --> 01:18:38.584
back to your husband.

01:18:42.626 --> 01:18:45.709
"Eisenstein lose his comrade confidence
in Soviet Union.

01:18:45.792 --> 01:18:47.876
"Stop. He is thought to be a deserter

01:18:47.959 --> 01:18:49.751
"who broke off with his own country. Stop.

01:18:49.834 --> 01:18:51.084
"I'm afraid the people here

01:18:51.167 --> 01:18:52.834
"would have no interest in him. Stop.

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:56.001
"I'm very sorry,
but all assert it is the fact. Stop.

01:18:56.084 --> 01:18:57.501
"My regards, Stalin."

01:18:57.584 --> 01:19:01.167
How did you get hold of a private telegram

01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:03.042
from Stalin to my husband?

01:19:03.126 --> 01:19:04.334
Well, from those very people

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.001
who apparently have no interest in me.

01:19:06.084 --> 01:19:07.459
So who's lying?

01:19:11.167 --> 01:19:14.709
And my husband wrote back at once,

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:18.542
saying he had never,
ever thought you were a deserter

01:19:18.626 --> 01:19:20.542
and had never been disloyal

01:19:20.626 --> 01:19:23.042
and that you were ferociously attacked

01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:25.751
by the American rednecks in California

01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:28.584
and that you stood firm in your principles

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.959
and had every intention of returning

01:19:31.042 --> 01:19:32.709
when the film was completed.

01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:34.959
There are so many contradictions
flying around

01:19:35.042 --> 01:19:36.417
to your advantage,

01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:39.584
it is hard to believe
that you want us to succeed.

01:19:39.667 --> 01:19:41.792
And I wonder what you have not contributed

01:19:41.876 --> 01:19:43.667
to all these contradictions.

01:19:43.751 --> 01:19:45.251
You have been nothing but trouble

01:19:45.334 --> 01:19:46.959
from the moment we started.

01:19:47.042 --> 01:19:49.334
Even on the train leaving Los Angeles,

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.042
you get into a fight with the brother

01:19:51.126 --> 01:19:52.751
of the Mexican Chief of Police.

01:19:52.834 --> 01:19:54.167
Well, we weren't to know who he was!

01:19:54.251 --> 01:19:56.209
He was ravishing some woman
on my couchette!

01:19:57.376 --> 01:20:00.667
With nights under hotel arrest
until Sinclair phoned Chaplin

01:20:00.751 --> 01:20:02.834
to persuade them to release you.

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:04.917
Well, see how popular we are.

01:20:05.001 --> 01:20:07.292
In the end, we had 12 American senators,

01:20:07.376 --> 01:20:08.542
Douglas Fairbanks,

01:20:08.626 --> 01:20:10.709
and Albert Einstein rooting for us.

01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:13.376
And the Mexican President apologised.

01:20:13.459 --> 01:20:15.334
What about that business with the young man

01:20:15.417 --> 01:20:18.584
stealing your gun and shooting his sister?

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:21.042
That was an unhappy accident,
which you well know.

01:20:21.126 --> 01:20:22.459
And it wasn't my gun.

01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:24.334
This troublemaker, your brother,

01:20:24.417 --> 01:20:26.001
is being very far from helpful.

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:27.834
His poor, not to say, bad management,

01:20:27.917 --> 01:20:30.167
and his not knowing anything
about film production

01:20:30.251 --> 01:20:33.292
has wasted hundreds of dollars
that we could do well with.

01:20:33.376 --> 01:20:35.709
He has presented me to your husband

01:20:35.792 --> 01:20:38.501
as a liar and a blackmailer
and God knows what else.

01:20:38.584 --> 01:20:41.417
It is impossible to work
under such an ignorant tyrant.

01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:43.834
What the hell does he know
about film production?

01:20:43.917 --> 01:20:46.792
He's just a stockbroker salesman
from the provincial South.

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:48.959
You have to get him off my back.

01:20:50.876 --> 01:20:53.001
- I wouldn't be at all surprised...
- <i>Señor!</i>

01:20:53.084 --> 01:20:54.542
If he was spending the film money

01:20:54.626 --> 01:20:56.459
on women, drink, and gambling.

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:58.001
We all know he was jailed in Mérida

01:20:58.084 --> 01:20:59.542
for public indecency at a brothel,

01:20:59.626 --> 01:21:02.917
throwing whores into a... swimming pool.

01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:05.334
You are a liar and a slanderer.

01:21:05.417 --> 01:21:07.917
I am a respectable businessman,

01:21:08.001 --> 01:21:10.334
and you and your company
are just a bunch of homos.

01:21:10.417 --> 01:21:11.626
Ah, what have we provoked?

01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:13.376
I think Mary, Mrs Upton Sinclair,

01:21:13.459 --> 01:21:15.584
we have all said more than
we intended, Kimbrough?

01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:18.417
I think not, Mr Sergei Eisenstein.

01:21:18.501 --> 01:21:19.667
I think not.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:22.876
Well, how am I to arrive
in this skeleton state for real?

01:21:22.959 --> 01:21:24.167
You have four options.

01:21:24.459 --> 01:21:26.876
One. The Stalin option,
an assassin from Moscow.

01:21:27.159 --> 01:21:28.601
Poisoned coffee.

01:21:29.292 --> 01:21:30.709
Machete in the desert.

01:21:30.792 --> 01:21:32.926
Pig falling down from balcony.

01:21:34.209 --> 01:21:36.084
Car without brakes. Eight out of ten.

01:21:36.167 --> 01:21:38.209
Oh, or two, wasting away

01:21:38.292 --> 01:21:40.667
in a Mexican jail for moral turpitude,

01:21:40.751 --> 01:21:44.167
either for the seduction
of the young and under aged or...

01:21:44.451 --> 01:21:45.917
Or, or for sodomy,

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:48.834
in which case expect perhaps
a red-hot poker up your arse

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:50.417
like Edward II.

01:21:50.501 --> 01:21:51.876
Six out of ten.

01:21:51.959 --> 01:21:53.751
Or three, Sinclair's revenge.

01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:55.417
He sets light to my film.

01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:57.542
And throws you on the pyre.
Two out of ten.

01:21:57.626 --> 01:21:59.709
Or four, the Camorrista kidnap me

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.251
and cut me up into little pieces,

01:22:01.334 --> 01:22:03.376
mailing me off on the slow boat
to Saint Petersburg.

01:22:03.459 --> 01:22:06.001
500,000 rubles for every pound of flesh.

01:22:06.084 --> 01:22:08.209
- Zero out of ten.
- Which is it going to be?

01:22:08.376 --> 01:22:11.251
Well, I think the Camorrista
are the most deserving.

01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:13.084
We don't want to disappoint them.

01:22:13.167 --> 01:22:15.251
We just have to take
Hunter Kimbrough's photograph

01:22:15.542 --> 01:22:16.876
and give it to the newspapers.

01:22:16.959 --> 01:22:18.101
That will do nicely.

01:22:18.751 --> 01:22:19.751
Camorrista!

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:23.559
No! No! No!

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:10.834
Come on, try it.

01:23:20.917 --> 01:23:23.417
Right. Come on.

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:27.001
Right, left.

01:23:50.292 --> 01:23:51.292
Hey.

01:23:54.917 --> 01:23:58.209
Well, I have to teach from 11:00
for three hours.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:00.584
See you later.

01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:55.292
Pera? ls that you?

01:24:56.126 --> 01:24:59.167
<i>Sergei, it's the middle of the night.</i>

01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:01.209
Oh, I'm sorry, were you asleep?

01:25:01.292 --> 01:25:02.501
Did I wake you?

01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:04.751
Do you have anyone with you?

01:25:05.251 --> 01:25:06.876
<i>Sergei, is that likely?</i>

01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:12.584
I was wondering
if you had finally given in to Boris.

01:25:12.667 --> 01:25:16.042
<i>Things are heating up here
about your long absence.</i>

01:25:16.126 --> 01:25:18.542
<i>They are threatening
to take away your apartment.</i>

01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:20.751
What? They can't do that.

01:25:20.834 --> 01:25:22.876
<i>Sergei, I'm afraid they can.</i>

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:25.334
<i>Do you want me to start
packing up your books?</i>

01:25:25.417 --> 01:25:27.501
<i>My God, it will take me months.</i>

01:25:27.584 --> 01:25:29.334
Listen, Pera, listen,

01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:34.251
I have something extraordinary
to tell you.

01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:36.584
This country...
This country is astonishing.

01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:39.417
All the large things in life
constantly hit you on your head,

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:41.834
in the pit of your stomach,
and in your heart.

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:43.834
Nothing can be superficial.

01:25:45.584 --> 01:25:46.751
You know how I work...

01:25:46.834 --> 01:25:49.334
Timid with affairs
of the heart and body.

01:25:49.417 --> 01:25:52.751
My prick always safely tucked up
in my trousers.

01:25:52.834 --> 01:25:54.126
<i>Sergei!</i>

01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:55.751
You know I'm a work automaton.

01:25:55.834 --> 01:25:58.709
Well, suddenly my timidity collapsed.

01:25:59.626 --> 01:26:01.042
My defences fell down.

01:26:03.084 --> 01:26:06.417
I shocked myself.
I behaved without reserve.

01:26:06.501 --> 01:26:08.876
You would have been
both shocked and amazed.

01:26:08.959 --> 01:26:10.626
And I would have wanted you to be.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:15.709
Everything we ever talked about
has been bowled over.

01:26:17.309 --> 01:26:19.209
I have been moaning
and complaining to you

01:26:19.292 --> 01:26:20.626
that I could not go the distance.

01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:22.009
Well, now I have...

01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:25.542
And beyond.

01:26:27.584 --> 01:26:29.667
I have got everything
that I desired.

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:32.792
And not just
the satisfaction of lechery.

01:26:33.084 --> 01:26:36.167
<i>Sergei, your secrets are safe with me.</i>

01:26:36.251 --> 01:26:38.917
<i>And you can tell me everything
later in every detail,</i>

01:26:39.001 --> 01:26:40.959
<i>but you must be careful.</i>

01:26:41.042 --> 01:26:43.417
<i>Now, hold your excitement
and tell me things</i>

01:26:43.501 --> 01:26:45.292
<i>our listener might want to hear.</i>

01:26:45.792 --> 01:26:50.209
Pera, I am sure
there is no secret listener.

01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:54.126
It is you, Pera,
you are the secret listener.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.376
You are two people.

01:26:55.459 --> 01:26:57.667
<i>Sergei, you might be right.</i>

01:26:57.751 --> 01:27:00.001
<i>I have probably
always been two people...</i>

01:27:00.084 --> 01:27:03.084
<i>Your secretary, nurse, and bum-wiper.</i>

01:27:06.251 --> 01:27:09.917
Pera, you have never wiped my backside,

01:27:10.001 --> 01:27:11.667
but Cañedo...

01:27:11.751 --> 01:27:13.209
<i>But Cañedo has?</i>

01:27:13.834 --> 01:27:15.667
<i>Sergei, shut up!</i>

01:27:15.751 --> 01:27:19.167
Pera, you are the only person
in the world

01:27:19.251 --> 01:27:23.042
that I can tell
without holding anything back.

01:27:23.126 --> 01:27:27.126
<i>That is both the best and the worst thing
you can tell me,</i>

01:27:27.209 --> 01:27:30.959
<i>especially on a cold October morning
at five degrees below zero.</i>

01:27:32.126 --> 01:27:35.584
<i>Now that I know you are well
and happy and working hard,</i>

01:27:35.667 --> 01:27:37.459
<i>I wait for your next call.</i>

01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:41.126
<i>I'm now going to cry myself to sleep.</i>

01:27:41.501 --> 01:27:42.751
<i>Good night, Sergei.</i>

01:27:43.209 --> 01:27:45.001
<i>Take very good care of yourself.</i>

01:28:36.501 --> 01:28:37.626
Death...

01:28:38.542 --> 01:28:41.876
Should always be ready
to take a call.

01:29:09.292 --> 01:29:12.084
Found you, Eisenstein.
Is this filmmaking?

01:29:12.209 --> 01:29:13.459
Of a kind.

01:29:13.834 --> 01:29:15.626
Looking after your feet is important.

01:29:16.417 --> 01:29:20.042
Did you know that ignoring
your feet in old age

01:29:20.126 --> 01:29:22.001
statistically brings on death?

01:29:22.084 --> 01:29:24.251
Corns, chilblains, blisters.

01:29:24.667 --> 01:29:26.834
In-growing toenails
cause walking problems.

01:29:26.917 --> 01:29:28.834
Problems of balance create falls,

01:29:28.917 --> 01:29:31.084
which mean damaged hips,
broken bones,

01:29:31.167 --> 01:29:32.626
which don't mend so good after 60.

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:34.001
How old are you, Mr Kimbrough?

01:29:34.084 --> 01:29:36.709
Eisenstein, I have a chiropodist

01:29:36.792 --> 01:29:38.126
to tell me all that.

01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:40.084
Oh, another mark of American affluence.

01:29:40.167 --> 01:29:43.542
Your average Russian wouldn't know
what a chiropodist was.

01:29:43.626 --> 01:29:45.417
So look after your feet, Kimbrough.

01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:47.542
If not, collapse of mobility,

01:29:47.626 --> 01:29:51.542
a downhill slide to permanent horizontality
without sex.

01:29:51.959 --> 01:29:55.292
Pneumonia, bedsores, depression, death.

01:29:55.834 --> 01:29:57.792
Stay vertical as long
as you can, Kimbrough.

01:29:57.876 --> 01:30:00.417
Look after your shoes
and look after your feet.

01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:02.876
Upton has sent me with an ultimatum.

01:30:03.417 --> 01:30:06.209
You have 20 days left
on your visa, Mr Eisenstein.

01:30:10.126 --> 01:30:11.126
God, Kimbrough!

01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:13.417
Have you brought along
the Mexican Passport Office?

01:30:13.501 --> 01:30:15.709
I'm afraid you'll have
to leave Mexico, sir.

01:30:15.792 --> 01:30:18.667
In that time, you have enough raw stock
to finish the film

01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:20.501
and a budget of $8,000.

01:30:20.584 --> 01:30:23.001
That's 20 minutes a day for 20 days.

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:24.709
Enough is enough.

01:30:24.792 --> 01:30:26.792
We have to bring this thing to an end.

01:30:26.876 --> 01:30:27.876
"This thing?"

01:30:27.959 --> 01:30:31.001
What to you, Mr Kimbrough,
is "this thing"?

01:30:31.084 --> 01:30:35.167
A long, protracted, irresponsible adventure

01:30:35.251 --> 01:30:36.584
leading to nowhere.

01:30:36.667 --> 01:30:38.917
Mary says Upton has to tame

01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:41.167
your disobedience and extravagance.

01:30:41.251 --> 01:30:44.751
Upton has collapsed and is sick
in hospital in Pasadena.

01:30:44.834 --> 01:30:47.209
The doctors say
too much unnecessary stress.

01:30:47.292 --> 01:30:49.292
He's been running around
on your behalf,

01:30:49.376 --> 01:30:52.834
forever raising money to satisfy
your exorbitant demands.

01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:55.751
I now take over.

01:30:56.334 --> 01:30:59.917
Upton has lost his faith in you
and your integrity.

01:31:01.459 --> 01:31:04.417
You have manoeuvred him, used him.

01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:07.751
He has empowered me to close it down,

01:31:07.834 --> 01:31:10.709
wrap it up, the end, full stop.

01:31:12.001 --> 01:31:13.751
You're like a Negro.

01:31:13.834 --> 01:31:16.959
Kind words and consideration
are not enough.

01:31:20.292 --> 01:31:22.084
I thought I was a Red.

01:31:23.084 --> 01:31:24.584
Now I'm also a Black?

01:31:25.167 --> 01:31:26.959
And you also forgot, a Jew.

01:31:27.292 --> 01:31:30.542
Being Russian is the mildest of concerns.

01:31:31.209 --> 01:31:35.459
You wear your prejudices
proudly on your sleeve, Mr Kimbrough,

01:31:35.542 --> 01:31:37.334
a true Southern gentleman.

01:31:37.501 --> 01:31:40.292
Upton is exhausted by your hesitations

01:31:40.376 --> 01:31:42.626
and delays and changes of plan

01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:45.042
and the dubious company you keep.

01:31:45.376 --> 01:31:47.709
You have deliberately
packed filth in our luggage

01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:50.542
sent through
United States Customs Authorities.

01:31:50.626 --> 01:31:53.376
The police said it was the
vilest thing they'd ever seen...

01:31:53.459 --> 01:31:56.459
Obscene and blasphemous drawings
of the Crucifixion.

01:31:56.542 --> 01:31:58.584
I leave for Hollywood on Wednesday.

01:31:59.084 --> 01:32:02.251
The last of the rushes
have to be in by the 21st of December

01:32:02.334 --> 01:32:03.834
when the contract terminates.

01:32:04.917 --> 01:32:06.876
Amkino and Moscow

01:32:06.959 --> 01:32:09.376
have said you must return to New York.

01:32:11.126 --> 01:32:14.126
You sail from New York
on the 17th of January.

01:32:15.084 --> 01:32:18.251
You'll be arriving in Europe
by the 23rd.

01:32:18.626 --> 01:32:20.334
Perhaps you can be back in Moscow

01:32:20.417 --> 01:32:22.042
by the 2nd of February.

01:32:23.167 --> 01:32:25.792
You miss the connection,
you are on your own.

01:32:25.876 --> 01:32:28.876
Mr Cañedo is no longer
your guide here in Guanajuato.

01:32:29.251 --> 01:32:30.459
He has been dismissed.

01:32:30.626 --> 01:32:31.667
Mr Cañedo,

01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:34.292
in Mexico City, they talked
about ending your contract

01:32:34.376 --> 01:32:36.001
at the end of this period.

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:37.834
It's best for his sake, Eisenstein,

01:32:37.917 --> 01:32:40.084
you should leave Guanajuato immediately.

01:32:40.167 --> 01:32:41.959
He has a wife and children.

01:32:42.042 --> 01:32:43.751
I suggest tomorrow morning!

01:32:45.292 --> 01:32:46.584
<i>Allí, cabrón.</i>

01:32:46.667 --> 01:32:48.459
<i>Quieto, cabrón, hijo de la chingada.</i>

01:35:10.334 --> 01:35:11.709
All right, Sergei.

01:35:12.251 --> 01:35:14.959
Now you have to give them back.

01:35:45.126 --> 01:35:47.042
What were you thinking of doing,

01:35:47.126 --> 01:35:49.292
opening a restaurant in Red Square?

01:35:50.917 --> 01:35:52.709
Don't you have forks in Moscow?

01:35:54.667 --> 01:35:56.459
It was my insurance policy...

01:35:58.709 --> 01:36:00.876
An excuse to be arrested.

01:36:27.542 --> 01:36:28.584
There.

01:36:29.459 --> 01:36:30.959
Now I cannot leave Guanajuato.

01:36:32.001 --> 01:36:34.001
I cannot go home.

01:36:35.959 --> 01:36:38.167
You must never separate
a Russian from his shoes.

01:36:40.167 --> 01:36:41.584
I cannot leave you.

01:36:42.667 --> 01:36:44.709
I cannot.

01:38:08.917 --> 01:38:10.667
Palomino loves well.

01:38:29.167 --> 01:38:30.417
You were lonely.

01:38:33.501 --> 01:38:35.001
You needed comforting.

01:38:38.167 --> 01:38:39.751
You were like a lost child.

01:38:55.834 --> 01:38:57.126
I love him.

01:39:06.501 --> 01:39:07.959
I love him, too.

01:39:50.376 --> 01:39:52.792
We will come to say good-bye.

01:39:55.084 --> 01:39:56.292
We want peace...

01:39:57.542 --> 01:39:58.667
All of us.

01:40:00.417 --> 01:40:03.126
And I am the one
to seal that peace.

01:40:04.959 --> 01:40:07.126
You have to go now, Sergei.

01:40:07.917 --> 01:40:09.209
Your time is up.

01:40:11.417 --> 01:40:12.917
We want Palomino back.

01:40:15.084 --> 01:40:18.292
He is not gonna spend
his time dreaming of Moscow.

01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:32.501
Drive away.

01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:36.792
This is the Day of the Dead,

01:40:36.876 --> 01:40:39.876
and I am a dead man.

01:40:42.251 --> 01:40:44.334
Drive slowly to the edge of town.

01:40:44.792 --> 01:40:46.417
This is a funeral cortege.

01:40:48.667 --> 01:40:51.084
And when you reach the edge of town,

01:40:51.876 --> 01:40:53.709
drive like the Devil.

01:40:53.792 --> 01:40:56.209
I need to leave Heaven in a hurry.

01:41:10.084 --> 01:41:14.251
<i>Eisenstein left Mexico
two months later.</i>

01:41:15.626 --> 01:41:19.709
<i>He had shot some 250 miles of film,</i>

01:41:19.792 --> 01:41:23.459
<i>which he was never allowed to edit.</i>

01:41:23.542 --> 01:41:30.042
<i>Soviet laws made homosexuality
a punishable offence in 1936.</i>

01:41:30.126 --> 01:41:33.334
<i>Homosexuals were sent to Siberia.</i>

01:41:33.417 --> 01:41:37.167
<i>Ten years' hard labour for sodomy.</i>

01:41:37.251 --> 01:41:42.667
<i>Eisenstein dies of heart attack
aged 50 in 1948,</i>

01:41:42.751 --> 01:41:46.292
<i>banging on the radiator pipes
for over three hours</i>

01:41:46.376 --> 01:41:48.376
<i>to arouse his neighbours,</i>

01:41:48.459 --> 01:41:50.542
<i>a prearranged signal,</i>

01:41:50.626 --> 01:41:53.084
<i>but they never heard him.</i>

01:41:55.584 --> 01:41:58.917
Day ten of my stay in Guanajuato

01:42:00.376 --> 01:42:02.292
is the 31st of October

01:42:03.126 --> 01:42:04.459
and the eve

01:42:05.417 --> 01:42:07.209
of the Day of the Dead.

01:42:09.292 --> 01:42:11.709
In the West, my film <i>October</i> is called

01:42:13.334 --> 01:42:15.417
<i>The Ten Days That Shook The World.</i>

01:42:16.417 --> 01:42:17.626
I...

01:42:18.709 --> 01:42:20.834
shall consider these ten days

01:42:21.584 --> 01:42:24.292
as the ten days that shook...

01:42:24.917 --> 01:42:27.042
Eisenstein.
