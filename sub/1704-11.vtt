PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:08.900 --> 00:11.695
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:11.762 --> 00:14.322
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.389 --> 00:16.029
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:16.030 --> 00:17.550
<i>in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.</i>

00:17.551 --> 00:19.231
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W.
BUSH: <i>This will not</i>

00:19.232 --> 00:20.737
<i>stand, this aggression
against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.804 --> 00:22.339
REAGAN: <i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.340 --> 00:24.620
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.621 --> 00:26.061
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:26.062 --> 00:27.502
<i>while refueling in the port of Aden.</i>

00:27.503 --> 00:28.663
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.664 --> 00:31.096
It was a despicable and cowardly act.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.248
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.249 --> 00:34.569

00:34.637 --> 00:37.071

00:44.948 --> 00:47.118
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

00:59.968 --> 01:01.904
Fuck!

01:01.972 --> 01:03.907
CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:03.974 --> 01:06.710
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:08.012 --> 01:10.314
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.381 --> 01:11.849
<i>Everyone missed something that day.</i>

<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:31.441 --> 01:32.881
Listen, Jessica, about last night...

01:32.882 --> 01:34.610
Hey, I loved last night.

01:34.678 --> 01:39.516
I felt happier
than I felt in a long time.

01:39.584 --> 01:42.052
Who does know the plan
to attack America?

01:42.120 --> 01:43.187
Roya Hammad.

01:43.255 --> 01:44.288
She's at a window counter

01:44.356 --> 01:45.756
with her camera crew.

01:45.824 --> 01:49.460
<i>If that's the device,</i>
<i>it's at least 200 pounds.</i>

01:49.527 --> 01:51.729
Tac one, Tac two, Tac three,
move now. Over.

01:51.797 --> 01:53.531
(tires screeching)

01:54.533 --> 01:55.633
FBI!

01:55.701 --> 01:57.668
Show your hands!

01:57.735 --> 01:58.702
CARRIE:
It's not him.

01:58.770 --> 02:00.037
It's not Abu Nazir.

02:02.574 --> 02:05.243
ESTES (over radio): Stand down.
We still need him. I say again,

02:05.311 --> 02:06.578
stand down.

02:06.646 --> 02:07.966
What the hell are you doing here?

02:07.967 --> 02:09.002
ADAL:
<i>Peter Quinn</i>

02:09.002 --> 02:10.683
- is one of mine.
- Why would Estes put a

02:10.684 --> 02:12.164
off-the-book
black ops guy in charge

02:12.185 --> 02:14.020
of a straight-up
intelligence operation?

02:14.088 --> 02:15.388
He just asked for a soldier.

02:15.456 --> 02:16.489
Soldiers kill people.

02:19.029 --> 02:21.149
Carrie's been in accident...
DC police found her car

02:21.150 --> 02:23.230
on 17th Street all smashed up...
it was broadsided.

02:23.297 --> 02:24.817
- Is she hurt?
- They can't find her.

02:24.870 --> 02:26.390
What the fuck have you done to Carrie?

02:26.391 --> 02:28.791
If you want to help her, you
will do exactly as I tell you.

02:28.837 --> 02:30.138
Walden has a bad heart.

02:30.205 --> 02:32.741
<i>His pacemaker can be</i>
<i>accessed wirelessly.</i>

02:32.808 --> 02:33.908
Send me the number,

02:33.976 --> 02:35.410
or I will kill her.

02:35.477 --> 02:37.445
(groaning)

02:37.513 --> 02:38.846
Call a doctor.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.351
I'm killing you.

02:44.054 --> 02:45.388
Saul, it's Carrie.

02:45.455 --> 02:47.624
- Carrie, where the fuck are you?
- Abu Nazir is in

02:47.691 --> 02:48.625
an abandoned mill.

02:48.692 --> 02:49.692
We'll find you. Stay put.

02:49.727 --> 02:50.727
Do not go after Nazir.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.762
- Saul Berenson?
- Yes.

02:51.829 --> 02:52.929
You're wanted upstairs.

02:52.997 --> 02:54.397
I'm on my way to catch a terrorist.

02:54.464 --> 02:56.024
What could be more important than that?

02:56.025 --> 02:56.665
They didn't say.

03:09.282 --> 03:11.183
(breathing heavily)

03:40.716 --> 03:43.351
(exhales)

03:43.419 --> 03:46.255

03:53.530 --> 03:55.365

MAN (distantly):
Show your hands!

04:37.441 --> 04:38.741
Show your hands!

04:38.809 --> 04:40.929
QUINN (normal): Lower your
weapons... she's with us!

04:40.997 --> 04:42.237
MAN:
All right, leaders on me.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.180
- Stand down, weapons set.
- Carrie?

04:44.248 --> 04:45.348
He was there.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.415
He was right in front of me,
we go to go get him.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.118
We will, but you stay here.

04:49.185 --> 04:50.705
- Bravo team. Make entry.
- Yes, sir!

04:50.706 --> 04:52.422
- Alpha team!
- We're on it.

04:52.489 --> 04:54.569
- Secure the perimeter.
MAN: - Bravo team, move in!

04:57.127 --> 04:59.229
Carrie...

04:59.296 --> 05:01.397
- I'm taking you to the medic.
- N-No.

05:01.465 --> 05:03.299
It's not for discussion;
you're shaking.

05:05.936 --> 05:07.771
He was right in front of me.

05:07.838 --> 05:09.139
I-I don't know
how I lost him.

05:09.206 --> 05:11.074
- You sure it was Nazir?
- Yeah.

05:11.142 --> 05:13.510
I followed him into the tunnels
right after I called Saul.

05:13.578 --> 05:16.146
- From where?
- Uh...

05:16.213 --> 05:17.947
somewhere here, right...

05:18.015 --> 05:20.417
right by where he was holding me.

05:20.484 --> 05:22.252
By a road.
Close by, then?

05:22.320 --> 05:25.088
Yeah. I-I wasn't
below ground that long.

05:25.156 --> 05:26.556
How did you get away?

05:29.693 --> 05:31.628
I escaped.

05:31.696 --> 05:32.729
How?

05:32.797 --> 05:34.164
I was lucky.

05:34.231 --> 05:35.898
(gasping breath)

05:35.966 --> 05:38.067
I-I'm freezing.

05:40.871 --> 05:42.606
Come on.

05:45.043 --> 05:46.610
Where's Saul?

05:46.678 --> 05:48.512
He's stuck at Langley.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.914
Probably tied up with the
vice president situation.

05:50.982 --> 05:53.451
What situation?

05:53.518 --> 05:55.486
Oh, right, you missed it.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.961
Walden died.

06:05.430 --> 06:07.198
How?

06:07.266 --> 06:10.101
Heart attack, in his house.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.971
Apparently,
his pacemaker malfunctioned.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.408
So sit, do whatever this guy tells you.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.445
I'll be right back,
hopefully with Nazir, okay?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.456
JESSICA:
Can't sleep?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.429
Me, either.

06:37.198 --> 06:39.132
I spoke to Cynthia.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.735
- How's she holding up?
- Barely.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.203
Whatever else,

06:43.271 --> 06:45.705
they were married for 30 years.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.907
She said she was glad you were with him

06:47.975 --> 06:49.910
when he died.

06:54.816 --> 06:58.586
It's all changed, hasn't it?

06:58.653 --> 07:00.587
Now that Bill's gone.

07:00.655 --> 07:01.788
Well, I'm not

07:01.856 --> 07:04.257
gonna be vice president,
if that's what you mean.

07:04.325 --> 07:06.726
That's not what I meant.

07:08.996 --> 07:12.365
I mean, it's <i>all</i> changed.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.469
Everything.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.841
I keep asking myself
how we even got here.

07:21.908 --> 07:23.910
Things just happened.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.544
Opportunities they seem like.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.816
We just went along,
one thing to the next.

07:38.225 --> 07:42.729
I think maybe this is a time
to stop and think.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.637
(sighs)

07:56.674 --> 07:59.275
(sighs) What is it?

08:01.178 --> 08:03.480
Just tell me.

08:07.719 --> 08:09.653
(phone buzzing)

08:16.128 --> 08:18.529
(phone continues buzzing)

08:18.597 --> 08:20.364
I think I should probably...

08:20.432 --> 08:22.132
Yeah.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.143
Hello?

08:32.211 --> 08:33.645
It's me.

08:33.712 --> 08:34.946
So you're okay?

08:35.014 --> 08:36.081
Yeah.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.082
(sighs) Where are you?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.751
Near where he had me.

08:39.818 --> 08:40.985
They're looking for him.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.820
- Who is?
- Everyone.

08:42.886 --> 08:45.690
Nearly half a dozen Tac teams.

08:45.757 --> 08:48.593
There's no way out;
we'll get him this time.

08:52.497 --> 08:54.432
Quinn already asked me, uh...

08:54.500 --> 08:56.467
how I got away.

08:56.534 --> 08:58.836
What did you tell him?

08:58.903 --> 09:01.438
That I escaped.

09:01.506 --> 09:02.706
Good.

09:02.774 --> 09:05.676
But what's Nazir gonna say
when we get him?

09:05.743 --> 09:07.511
- It doesn't matter.
- It does.

09:08.613 --> 09:10.914
(whispers):
Walden's dead.

09:10.982 --> 09:14.785
Look... all that
matters to me right now

09:14.852 --> 09:16.853
is that you're safe.

09:25.563 --> 09:27.564
I got to go.

09:50.388 --> 09:51.754
(sighs)

10:09.140 --> 10:10.340
Larry.

10:10.408 --> 10:12.842
Saul.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.612
So this is what Estes is up to.

10:15.679 --> 10:17.614
- What's that?
- This. You.

10:17.682 --> 10:19.282
- A polygraph.
- Calm down.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.250
Which he's using for one reason...

10:21.318 --> 10:23.219
to keep me locked away in a room.

10:23.286 --> 10:26.288
- I wouldn't know.
- You do know; I just told you.

10:26.356 --> 10:29.892
Saul... we all
agree to this.

10:29.959 --> 10:33.094
Section 17-dot-three of
your employment contract.

10:33.162 --> 10:34.429
Fine.

10:34.497 --> 10:36.431
You really have to <i>calm down.</i>

10:36.499 --> 10:38.433
Why the fuck should I?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.634
You'll fail the test.

10:39.702 --> 10:41.469
Fail the test?
What is this, middle school?

10:41.537 --> 10:43.071
Of course I'm gonna fail the test.

10:43.138 --> 10:44.739
The test is a goddamn farce.

10:44.807 --> 10:47.542
Not to Estes it's not.

10:47.610 --> 10:49.377
He seemed very serious about it.

10:49.445 --> 10:51.146
Could you stand up for me?

10:52.915 --> 10:54.182
Mm-hmm.

10:54.250 --> 10:57.452
Just hold that there.

10:57.519 --> 10:59.087
So, what's the pretext?

10:59.154 --> 11:00.839
What do you mean?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.680
I mean, what are you
even gonna ask me about?

11:02.681 --> 11:03.992
Company vehicles?

11:04.060 --> 11:06.095
Excessive use of office supplies?

11:06.163 --> 11:07.997
I'm just here to set up the machine.

11:08.065 --> 11:11.166
(door opens) He'll be
asking all the questions.

11:15.472 --> 11:17.440
Who the fuck are you?

11:22.946 --> 11:24.881
NEWSWOMAN:
He was Director of the CIA

11:24.948 --> 11:26.716
for three and a half tumultuous years

11:26.783 --> 11:28.551
before being elected vice president.

11:28.619 --> 11:31.220
Walden attended Notre Dame,
where he was

11:31.288 --> 11:34.223
- an All-American running back.
- Vice President of the United States...

11:34.291 --> 11:36.531
you'd think they could find
something more vivid to say

11:36.532 --> 11:37.932
than he played football in college.

11:40.298 --> 11:41.798
Tac teams completed

11:41.866 --> 11:43.834
the initial sweep... no Nazir.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.639
That's not possible.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.575
I was right on his heels.

11:50.643 --> 11:53.411
I know. But I think
we've got to concede

11:53.479 --> 11:55.714
that he might have gotten out of here.

11:55.782 --> 11:58.170
We've got two members of Nazir's
network back at Langley

11:58.171 --> 11:59.251
waiting to be interrogated.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.153
You really think he got out of here

12:01.221 --> 12:02.321
past all of <i>this?</i>

12:02.389 --> 12:03.756
I'm saying it looks that way.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.461
Then he had help;
he must have.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.270
- From whom?
- Well, why did we put

12:11.271 --> 12:13.031
this operation off grid
in the first place?

12:13.099 --> 12:14.819
Because we've had leaks
all along the way.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.101
So you think

12:16.169 --> 12:17.903
one of our people
is working against us?

12:17.970 --> 12:20.138
- What, you have another explanation?
- Yeah, Nazir

12:20.206 --> 12:22.374
- got away before we even got here.
- I told you,

12:22.442 --> 12:23.609
he was right there!

12:23.676 --> 12:25.778
I heard him!

12:29.950 --> 12:32.218
Okay, we'll take another look.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.287
Hey, guys, let's go.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.257
We're going back in.

12:42.296 --> 12:44.898
Let's try again.
(clears throat)

12:44.966 --> 12:47.467
- Is your name Saul Berenson?
- Yes.

12:47.535 --> 12:48.802
Are you sometimes

12:48.870 --> 12:52.005
- called "The Bear"?
- Fuckin' hope not.

12:52.073 --> 12:53.941
No.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.211
Are you presently in Alabama?

12:57.279 --> 12:59.280
No.

12:59.348 --> 13:00.648
Do you intend

13:00.716 --> 13:02.250
to answer truthfully here today?

13:02.317 --> 13:04.218
(sighs)

13:06.009 --> 13:07.889
Do you intend to answer
truthfully here today?

13:07.956 --> 13:09.023
Yes.

13:09.091 --> 13:11.560
I'd prefer this not take all night.

13:11.627 --> 13:13.929
See, I think you'd prefer that it did.

13:13.996 --> 13:16.431
Are you acquainted with Aileen Morgan?

13:16.499 --> 13:18.000
Yes.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.568
I was.

13:19.636 --> 13:21.870
- Are you aware that she killed herself?
- Yes.

13:21.938 --> 13:24.540
Were you with Aileen when she died?

13:24.608 --> 13:25.541
Yes.

13:25.609 --> 13:27.343
Was Aileen a terrorist?

13:27.410 --> 13:29.045
She said she was.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.080
- Yes or no.
- Yes.

13:33.183 --> 13:34.851
Do you live on Tripoli Lane?

13:34.918 --> 13:36.552
No.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.055
Did you provide the weapon

13:39.122 --> 13:41.224
Aileen Morgan used to kill herself?

13:42.326 --> 13:43.760
What?

13:43.828 --> 13:46.263
Answer the question.

13:46.330 --> 13:49.733
Is that what this is about?

13:49.801 --> 13:52.102
I provided the weapon?

13:52.170 --> 13:53.210
Did you provide the weapon

13:53.211 --> 13:55.411
- Aileen Morgan used to kill herself?
- You tell Estes

13:55.412 --> 13:57.774
no matter how many bullshit
charges he trumps up,

13:57.842 --> 13:59.109
I'm onto him.

13:59.177 --> 14:01.912
He wants to frame me for her death?

14:01.980 --> 14:04.481
Go ahead, try.

14:04.549 --> 14:06.717
You know what this is really about?

14:06.785 --> 14:09.753
Do you?

14:09.820 --> 14:12.756
A plan to assassinate
a U.S. Congressman

14:12.824 --> 14:15.058
the second Abu Nazir
is out of the picture.

14:15.126 --> 14:16.593
Why don't you ask me

14:16.661 --> 14:18.628
a few questions about that?

14:24.335 --> 14:25.970
Did you provide the weapon

14:26.037 --> 14:28.806
Aileen Morgan used to kill herself?

14:32.244 --> 14:33.945
CARRIE:
...five, six, seven.

14:34.013 --> 14:35.247
Okay, who else?

14:35.315 --> 14:37.316
A team is eight members, right?

14:37.384 --> 14:38.517
Yes.

14:38.585 --> 14:40.452
Could you join us, please?

14:40.520 --> 14:42.921
Over here?

14:42.989 --> 14:45.469
Okay, so who was responsible for
directing the actual search?

14:45.470 --> 14:48.159
Carrie...
Excuse me, please.

14:48.227 --> 14:49.427
What are you doing?

14:49.495 --> 14:51.697
I want to talk to the people
who cleared the tunnel.

14:51.764 --> 14:53.644
- Talk to them?
- To ask them a few questions.

14:53.712 --> 14:55.712
Like what? If they're working
for the other side?

14:55.713 --> 14:57.669
- They are all ex-military.
- So?

14:57.737 --> 14:59.777
So you do not want to be
questioning their loyalty

14:59.778 --> 15:00.218
on a hunch.

15:00.219 --> 15:01.506
I told you, if Nazir got away

15:01.574 --> 15:03.108
someone must have helped him.

15:04.397 --> 15:06.277
These guys work in pairs,
you know that right?

15:06.345 --> 15:08.385
So do you want to explain
to me how one of them is

15:08.386 --> 15:10.746
helping Nazir while his buddy's
looking over his shoulder?

15:10.747 --> 15:12.787
Or is it more than one?
Or all of them? Or one big

15:12.788 --> 15:14.588
- conspiracy?
- Who was there from our side?

15:14.589 --> 15:16.823
Who was directing the search?
Which of our people?

15:16.890 --> 15:18.824
- Me.
- (sighs) Who else?

15:18.892 --> 15:20.526
Does that mean you trust me?

15:20.594 --> 15:22.094
Who else?

15:23.196 --> 15:24.630
Galvez.

15:29.536 --> 15:31.069
Uh, Danny Galvez.

15:31.137 --> 15:32.638
Where is he?

15:32.705 --> 15:33.739
I'll poll security.

15:33.806 --> 15:35.907
Galvez... does it even
make sense?

15:35.975 --> 15:37.342
I don't know. I...

15:37.409 --> 15:39.344
He took a bullet in the tailor shop.

15:39.411 --> 15:42.514
Well, Nazir has a history
of sacrificing his own people.

15:42.582 --> 15:44.683
Did he even have
access? The leaks

15:44.750 --> 15:46.751
over the past year,
does Galvez make sense?

15:47.887 --> 15:49.755
It might.
(sighs)

15:49.822 --> 15:51.757
What?

15:53.560 --> 15:55.828
He is a Muslim.

15:57.864 --> 15:59.665
MAN: Galvez cleared security

15:59.733 --> 16:01.767
at main gate two minutes ago.
He's driving north.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.068
He has Nazir.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.336
Shut the outer perimeter.
I want that car stopped now.

16:05.337 --> 16:07.039
- Bravo team, with us!
- Bravo, mount up.

16:07.107 --> 16:08.987
(siren wailing)
MAN: Eagle, this is Unit Four.

16:08.988 --> 16:10.275
We have target vehicle in sight.

16:10.343 --> 16:13.211
(over radio): Approaching
blockade and counting five.

16:13.279 --> 16:14.519
(indistinct radio transmission)

16:14.520 --> 16:16.848
(siren wailing)

16:27.960 --> 16:29.620
Put your hands on the wheel

16:29.621 --> 16:31.061
where we can see them!
Do not move!

16:33.765 --> 16:35.966
CARRIE:
Can you see him? Nazir?

16:36.033 --> 16:38.502
QUINN:
Not yet.

16:41.639 --> 16:43.340
- Is he armed?
- Can't tell.

16:45.376 --> 16:47.277
Let's get them out of there.

16:47.345 --> 16:48.211
Let's go!

16:53.384 --> 16:55.518
- Out of the car.
- (grunts) What the?

16:55.586 --> 16:57.687
On the ground. Get down.
Now. (grunting)

17:00.291 --> 17:02.058
GALVEZ:
Carrie.

17:02.126 --> 17:03.766
- What are you doing?
CARRIE: - Shut up.

17:03.767 --> 17:06.229
- No weapons. He's clean.
- Clear!

17:08.833 --> 17:10.599
There's no one else in the vehicle!

17:11.703 --> 17:13.502
Where is he?

17:13.570 --> 17:15.338
(groans) Goddamn it, Danny,

17:15.406 --> 17:16.506
where did you take him?

17:16.574 --> 17:17.894
- Who?
- Abu Nazir, where is he?

17:17.909 --> 17:18.976
QUINN:
Carrie.

17:19.042 --> 17:20.163
- Tell me!
QUINN: - Carrie!

17:20.164 --> 17:22.744
He's bleeding.

17:22.813 --> 17:24.981
My stitches ripped open.
I was going to the hospital.

17:25.048 --> 17:26.816
All right, let him up.

17:26.883 --> 17:29.151
MAN: Yes, sir.
(Galvez groaning)

17:29.219 --> 17:31.353
Let's get a medic.

17:31.421 --> 17:33.155
Ah, Jesus.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.157
(Galvez groaning, panting)

17:38.094 --> 17:39.795
(Carrie sighs)

17:56.145 --> 17:57.446
Morning.

17:57.513 --> 17:59.681
(scoffs)

18:03.185 --> 18:05.487
You have any idea where your mother is?

18:05.554 --> 18:06.688
(scoffs)

18:06.756 --> 18:08.690
Probably in the bathroom crying.

18:08.758 --> 18:11.159
I mean, if last night
is any indication.

18:11.227 --> 18:13.161
(pours cereal)

18:20.169 --> 18:22.103
(sighs)

18:22.171 --> 18:23.872
Here, take mine.

18:23.939 --> 18:25.873
- No, thanks.
- I didn't touch it.

18:25.941 --> 18:28.543
Yeah, well, I'm not going to either.

18:28.610 --> 18:31.212
You know, there's a 7-Eleven
half a block away.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.680
They have milk.

18:32.748 --> 18:34.915
It's too bad we can't go there.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.550
Want to tell me what's bugging you?

18:36.618 --> 18:37.652
Nothing is

18:37.719 --> 18:41.255
"bugging me." I just want
to go to school.

18:41.323 --> 18:43.357
Most parents would be thrilled.

18:43.425 --> 18:46.061
I thought we were doing better.

18:46.128 --> 18:47.929
Yeah, well, I guess not.

18:53.268 --> 18:54.836
I swear to God, if I have

18:54.904 --> 18:57.038
to listen to another
minute of <i>Kuma War,</i>

18:57.106 --> 18:59.174
I am going to kill someone.
(game stops)

18:59.242 --> 19:00.575
- Dad!
- Dana.

19:00.643 --> 19:02.177
What are we doing here?

19:02.245 --> 19:04.279
Could someone please tell me that?

19:04.347 --> 19:06.627
- I told you.
- Yeah, you told me something that did not

19:06.628 --> 19:07.788
make any sense.
(door opens)

19:07.789 --> 19:09.184
(door closes)

19:09.252 --> 19:11.186
I got more milk.

19:11.254 --> 19:13.522
They actually let you leave?

19:13.589 --> 19:15.657
Major Mendez got it for me.

19:15.725 --> 19:16.959
BRODY:
Okay now? Dana?

19:17.026 --> 19:17.993
Why? What's wrong?

19:19.095 --> 19:21.029
DANA:
Nothing.

19:22.832 --> 19:23.898
Oh, fuck!

19:23.966 --> 19:24.966
JESSICA:
Dana.

19:25.034 --> 19:27.201
This is leaking.
It's disgusting!

19:27.269 --> 19:28.703
- Oh!
- I am so sick

19:28.770 --> 19:30.138
- of this!
- Dana.

19:30.205 --> 19:31.372
What are we

19:31.440 --> 19:32.907
even doing here?!

19:32.974 --> 19:35.042
- We're only here a while longer.
- Why are

19:35.110 --> 19:36.710
<i>you</i> even here?!

19:36.778 --> 19:37.811
Why do you not just go

19:37.879 --> 19:39.613
live with that crazy woman

19:39.680 --> 19:41.448
- and leave us alone!
JESSICA: - Hey.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.149
CHRIS:
No, Dana, shut up!

19:43.217 --> 19:44.551
We're better off with Mike,

19:44.618 --> 19:45.952
all of us.

19:46.020 --> 19:48.054
He has been a better father to us

19:48.122 --> 19:50.057
- than you ever were!
JESSICA: - I don't think

19:50.124 --> 19:52.025
we should be making any
decisions right now.

19:52.093 --> 19:53.093
DANA:
Yeah.

19:53.161 --> 19:54.128
Any of us.

19:55.230 --> 19:57.098
We need to just stop.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.100
Until we get home.
To our house.

19:59.168 --> 20:01.569
And then we'll figure everything out.

20:04.807 --> 20:06.742
(sighs)

20:08.878 --> 20:10.312
QUINN:
<i>You can't blame yourself.</i>

20:10.380 --> 20:12.140
- Sure.
- If communication had been better,

20:12.141 --> 20:14.984
we would've known Galvez was
on his way to the hospital.

20:15.051 --> 20:16.652
ESTES:
Hey.

20:16.720 --> 20:18.654
I heard about the ugliness out there.

20:18.722 --> 20:20.256
It was my fault.

20:20.324 --> 20:21.591
It's done.

20:21.659 --> 20:23.426
So, where are we now?

20:24.528 --> 20:26.429
I just want to get Nazir.

20:28.599 --> 20:31.769
Excuse me, I've waited
two days to wash my face.

20:35.741 --> 20:38.743
I'm, uh, having Roya Hammad
moved to Interrogation B

20:38.811 --> 20:39.944
like you asked.

20:40.012 --> 20:41.579
Good. We'll get on her.

20:41.647 --> 20:42.613
Not "we."

20:42.681 --> 20:43.848
I want you to question her.

20:43.916 --> 20:45.817
Well, Carrie knows more
about her network.

20:45.885 --> 20:46.884
Agreed, but...

20:46.952 --> 20:48.319
Nazir could be anywhere.

20:48.387 --> 20:50.722
We're not gonna find him
without some help.

20:50.789 --> 20:52.309
We need to take our best shot at this,

20:52.310 --> 20:54.192
and after what Carrie's just pulled,

20:54.260 --> 20:55.794
I doubt that's her.

20:55.861 --> 20:57.796
Okay.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.402
Let me know how it goes.

21:04.871 --> 21:06.805
(door opens)

21:13.613 --> 21:15.314
(moans)

21:16.416 --> 21:18.350
(hisses)

21:21.821 --> 21:23.723
(sighs)

21:25.559 --> 21:26.992
(softly):
Oh, God.

21:30.464 --> 21:32.365
(sighs)

21:35.670 --> 21:37.605
(sighs)

21:43.478 --> 21:45.412
(gasps)

21:46.515 --> 21:48.148
(gasps)

21:50.786 --> 21:52.720
(sighs)

21:54.355 --> 21:56.557
(exhales)

21:56.624 --> 21:58.559
(sniffles)

22:01.897 --> 22:03.831
(sighs)

22:05.167 --> 22:07.101
(chains clanking)

22:09.471 --> 22:11.372
(beep)

22:38.168 --> 22:40.102
(door closes)

22:46.108 --> 22:48.376
CARRIE: I spent an
afternoon with him.

22:50.145 --> 22:52.280
Abu Nazir.

22:52.347 --> 22:53.881
He put a gun to my head

22:53.949 --> 22:56.483
and came very close
to pulling the trigger.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.854
He did this to me, and, uh,

23:00.922 --> 23:02.289
he did this.

23:11.032 --> 23:13.167
(scoffs)

23:13.235 --> 23:15.502
He was surprisingly frank.

23:15.570 --> 23:17.772
He told me it would take centuries

23:17.839 --> 23:19.507
to defeat the unbelievers, and

23:19.575 --> 23:23.412
he didn't care how many
casualties there would be.

23:23.479 --> 23:26.415
On either side, how many people died...

23:27.517 --> 23:30.186
...it's of no concern.

23:32.156 --> 23:34.591
I think that's him.

23:34.659 --> 23:36.593
Not you.

23:37.696 --> 23:39.630
You were a student

23:39.698 --> 23:43.768
and then a reporter, but
you were never a soldier.

23:44.903 --> 23:47.705
You've never been there,
at ground zero,

23:47.772 --> 23:48.973
when the bomb goes off,

23:49.040 --> 23:51.875
knowing all that death is on you.

23:54.078 --> 23:57.013
The naval base attack
would have been the first time.

23:58.816 --> 24:02.685
300 men and women coming home.

24:02.753 --> 24:06.756
Their families waiting for them.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.958
Their children.

24:10.060 --> 24:11.995
All just...

24:12.063 --> 24:14.698
blown to pieces.

24:18.736 --> 24:20.670
But it didn't happen.

24:20.738 --> 24:22.672
(sighs)

24:24.876 --> 24:27.777
And now you have a second chance.

24:30.982 --> 24:33.249
Take it.

24:35.353 --> 24:37.788
Because I think there's
some part of you

24:37.855 --> 24:41.758
that's relieved that
bomb never went off.

24:45.863 --> 24:47.630
Shit.

24:47.698 --> 24:49.565
CARRIE (over speaker):
Roya,

24:49.633 --> 24:51.100
what he does,

24:51.167 --> 24:53.435
which is kill innocent people...

24:56.139 --> 24:58.540
...it's justified
by a future which...

24:58.607 --> 25:01.142
(sighs)

25:01.209 --> 25:05.412
...for the life of me I can't
believe you actually want.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.415
How could you know what I want?

25:14.688 --> 25:17.790
I know it's not that.

25:22.997 --> 25:26.599
I-I understand that this is
personal for you.

25:27.902 --> 25:32.004
That your family lost
land to the occupation.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.008
That your grandfather was killed.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.812
But Nazir can't change that.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.816
His only answer is perpetual war.

25:45.018 --> 25:46.919
(sighs)

25:49.355 --> 25:51.923
Roya.

25:57.129 --> 25:59.997
Have you ever...

26:00.065 --> 26:03.134
have you ever had someone who

26:03.202 --> 26:07.839
somehow...

26:07.906 --> 26:09.874
takes over your life,

26:09.942 --> 26:12.310
pulls you in...

26:12.377 --> 26:16.780
gets you to do things
that aren't really you?

26:16.848 --> 26:19.249
That you know are wrong...

26:22.621 --> 26:25.022
...but you can't
help yourself?

26:28.260 --> 26:31.995
Do you have anyone like that?

26:39.837 --> 26:41.804
Yes.

26:45.241 --> 26:47.008
Well...

26:47.076 --> 26:50.546
I've never been that stupid.

26:51.648 --> 26:54.517
You idiot whore,

26:54.584 --> 26:56.285
you think you understand me?!

26:56.353 --> 26:59.155
Or what my family,
have lost and suffered?!

26:59.223 --> 27:02.492
You think this is just
some fucking game?

27:03.661 --> 27:06.996
Nazir's not afraid of you, I'm not.

27:07.063 --> 27:09.231
I don't need your help,
I don't want it.

27:09.299 --> 27:11.667
(speaks Arabic)

27:16.072 --> 27:18.106
(continues in Arabic)

27:30.607 --> 27:32.087
I'm gonna have someone take you home.

27:32.154 --> 27:33.255
- No.
- I'm not asking.

27:33.322 --> 27:34.890
You've been up for a day and a half.

27:34.957 --> 27:38.159
I fucked it up in there.

27:38.227 --> 27:40.295
Our chance to get
Nazir. Fuck.

27:40.363 --> 27:41.796
We'll see.

27:41.864 --> 27:44.299
Go home and get some rest, okay?

27:44.366 --> 27:47.836
I'm gonna deal with Roya
and I'll keep you posted.

27:47.903 --> 27:50.305
Nothing's gonna happen
without you, I promise.

27:58.649 --> 28:00.650
Thanks for getting this done
so quickly.

28:00.718 --> 28:02.451
My pleasure.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.053
How'd it go?

28:04.121 --> 28:05.641
It's all there, everything you wanted.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.524
I quizzed him on the main
topics we discussed.

28:08.591 --> 28:11.092
The illegal surveillance
of Sergeant Brody,

28:11.160 --> 28:14.596
the death of Aileen Morgan,
general insubordination.

28:14.664 --> 28:19.401
Plus a couple of detours
I found along the way.

28:19.469 --> 28:20.635
So we're done.

28:20.703 --> 28:22.503
You've got enough there
to do what you want.

28:22.504 --> 28:25.340
You can fire him, tie him up
in administrative proceedings

28:25.408 --> 28:28.543
for the next decade, refer him
to harsher interrogations.

28:28.611 --> 28:30.845
I'm hoping none of that
will be necessary.

28:30.913 --> 28:34.215
Yeah, sure, goes without saying.

28:36.751 --> 28:39.119
Funny detail, though.

28:39.187 --> 28:40.821
He went on this crazy rant

28:40.889 --> 28:45.860
about an assassination plot
against a U.S. Congressman.

28:45.928 --> 28:47.648
The machine said he was telling
the truth.

28:52.569 --> 28:55.504
I'm calling it an anomaly.

28:55.572 --> 28:58.240
Thought it was best to leave it out.

29:18.695 --> 29:20.262
(exhales)

29:41.551 --> 29:43.719
(horn honks)

29:47.157 --> 29:49.826
(horn blaring)

30:02.840 --> 30:05.375
(horn blares)

30:09.180 --> 30:11.181
(phone ringing)

30:16.254 --> 30:17.388
You home yet?

30:17.455 --> 30:18.689
CARRIE:
I'm not going home.

30:18.757 --> 30:19.857
Carrie...

30:19.925 --> 30:21.059
Listen to me.

30:21.126 --> 30:22.606
Something Roya said was bothering me.

30:22.607 --> 30:24.495
She said Nazir wouldn't run.

30:24.563 --> 30:26.464
From you, she said.

30:26.532 --> 30:28.733
(speaks Arabic)

30:28.801 --> 30:32.837
From me, from whomever,
it means run, literally.

30:32.905 --> 30:36.474
Not back down, not be afraid of.
Run. As in movement.

30:36.542 --> 30:38.510
What if Nazir didn't run
and we're looking in

30:38.578 --> 30:39.511
all the wrong places?

30:39.579 --> 30:40.813
So what are the right places?

30:40.881 --> 30:42.082
Back in the tunnels.

30:42.150 --> 30:44.785
Nazir never left.

30:44.853 --> 30:46.487
- We searched the tunnels.
- I know.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.922
With multiple teams.

30:47.989 --> 30:50.658
If Nazir was hiding in there,
we'd have found him.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.126
This has happened before.

30:52.194 --> 30:55.596
His just vanishing right under
our noses like a magic trick.

30:55.664 --> 30:58.232
I'm heading back there.

30:58.300 --> 31:02.403
Quinn, I'm heading back.

31:02.471 --> 31:04.573
I'll be there soon.

31:14.518 --> 31:15.785
Where is everyone?

31:15.853 --> 31:17.020
All done.

31:17.088 --> 31:18.621
Where are the Tac teams?

31:18.689 --> 31:20.623
Them, too.
Left a while ago.

31:20.690 --> 31:22.958
There might be one crew still here,

31:23.026 --> 31:24.259
over behind that building.

31:24.327 --> 31:25.894
Stay here.
Don't go anywhere.

31:25.962 --> 31:27.495
Don't let anyone else leave!

31:32.434 --> 31:35.269
Stop! Stop!

31:35.337 --> 31:36.870
(tires screeching)

31:37.672 --> 31:38.705
Thank God.

31:38.773 --> 31:40.807
- What is it?
- We need to sweep the tunnels.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.842
- We did.
- One last time.

31:42.910 --> 31:45.011
Ma'am, we've been
called back to Langley.

31:45.079 --> 31:49.649
Tell Peter Quinn. He'll give you
whatever authorization you need.

31:49.717 --> 31:52.586
Please. Our target,
I think he's still here.

32:10.506 --> 32:13.207
The results of your polygraph session.

32:13.274 --> 32:14.408
Open it, take a look.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.944
I don't need to.
I know what's in there.

32:17.011 --> 32:18.646
I also know why you did it.

32:18.713 --> 32:19.880
And why's that?

32:19.948 --> 32:21.181
Because I was right...

32:21.249 --> 32:24.051
you're planning a hit on Brody.

32:24.118 --> 32:27.054
You want me out of the way

32:27.122 --> 32:28.255
where I can't interfere.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.857
So you trumped that up.

32:29.925 --> 32:32.393
There's nothing trumped up there, Saul.

32:32.461 --> 32:33.662
That's a product

32:33.729 --> 32:34.996
of standard agency procedures.

32:35.064 --> 32:36.765
Fuck you.

32:36.832 --> 32:39.000
How you going to do, huh?

32:39.068 --> 32:41.108
How you going to do
on the polygraph when they ask

32:41.109 --> 32:43.204
if you ever executed
a member of Congress?

32:43.272 --> 32:47.943
We both know what Brody is, and
congressman is the least of it.

32:48.010 --> 32:49.711
We have a deal with him.

32:49.779 --> 32:51.813
We don't make deals with terrorists,

32:51.881 --> 32:54.382
and if he's confused about that,
or you are,

32:54.450 --> 32:56.418
that's not my problem.

32:56.485 --> 33:00.355
What is my problem is the way
you continually undermine me.

33:00.423 --> 33:02.391
I can't allow it.

33:02.459 --> 33:04.360
You're through here.

33:06.029 --> 33:07.797
I want you gone.

33:07.864 --> 33:10.132
What the official story is,
that's up to you,

33:10.200 --> 33:13.703
but I will use this to tie you up

33:13.770 --> 33:15.738
in hearing after hearing for the rest

33:15.806 --> 33:18.574
of your natural life if I have to.

33:18.642 --> 33:20.643
You think about that.

33:28.319 --> 33:30.554
(door closes)

33:48.372 --> 33:50.273
Mind if I ask?

33:51.408 --> 33:53.343
What happened to your face?

33:54.812 --> 33:57.647
This guy we're looking for...
he did that.

33:57.715 --> 34:00.217
You're the one he held hostage.

34:00.284 --> 34:01.885
Yeah.

34:01.953 --> 34:03.887
Why you?

34:07.024 --> 34:09.126

34:36.388 --> 34:39.090
These conduits are passing
right through it.

34:40.192 --> 34:42.126
Yeah.

At ceiling height,
like there's a room back there.

34:55.873 --> 34:57.775

45:06.489 --> 45:08.825
I don't want to fight any more.

45:10.928 --> 45:13.997
Even <i>for</i> something.

45:14.065 --> 45:16.600
I'm tired of fighting.

45:16.668 --> 45:18.569
Me, too.

45:24.509 --> 45:26.677
We were okay for so long.

45:26.745 --> 45:28.846
You know?

45:28.914 --> 45:31.849
Since we were 16,

45:31.917 --> 45:34.685
and all we wanted was to be together,

45:34.753 --> 45:37.388
we were so okay.

45:37.455 --> 45:39.389
I know.

45:42.727 --> 45:44.861
Was it Mike?

45:44.929 --> 45:46.496
- No.
- Because...

45:46.564 --> 45:49.299
No, it wasn't.
You know that.

45:53.370 --> 45:55.571
I tried, Brody.

45:55.639 --> 45:57.573
(sighs)

45:57.641 --> 46:00.209
I really tried.

46:00.276 --> 46:04.647
I just keep wishing
that I'd been bigger somehow,

46:04.715 --> 46:06.716
able to give you...

46:06.784 --> 46:09.585
what you needed to be okay again
after you got back,

46:09.653 --> 46:11.054
but I couldn't.

46:11.122 --> 46:12.589
You did fine.

46:12.657 --> 46:16.060
It was just... beyond me.

46:16.127 --> 46:18.596
Jess...

46:18.664 --> 46:21.099
(sighs)

46:21.167 --> 46:23.468
There was nothing
<i>anyone</i> could have done.

46:26.606 --> 46:28.540
Even me.

46:28.608 --> 46:30.509
Because I tried, too.

46:33.613 --> 46:36.715
To deal with everything that happened.

46:36.783 --> 46:39.217
But th...

46:39.285 --> 46:41.219
that was beyond me.

46:45.491 --> 46:49.060
I was fucked up when I left for Iraq.

46:53.032 --> 46:55.567
We all were.

47:11.416 --> 47:13.351
(sniffles)

47:16.955 --> 47:19.422
The time Carrie came...

47:19.490 --> 47:22.259
came over here to the house...

47:24.296 --> 47:26.931
...on the day that
Elizabeth Gaines was shot

47:26.999 --> 47:28.700
and Tom Walker died...

47:32.205 --> 47:34.440
...Carrie said some...

47:34.508 --> 47:36.743
some crazy things

47:36.810 --> 47:40.513
to Dana and to you.

47:40.581 --> 47:42.115
(sighs)

47:42.183 --> 47:44.518
She said things about
what I was going to do.

47:44.585 --> 47:48.288
Don't. Not now.

47:48.356 --> 47:51.491
(cries)

47:51.559 --> 47:53.627
For the longest time,

47:53.695 --> 47:56.730
all I wanted was for you
to tell me the truth.

47:56.798 --> 47:59.099
I wanted to know it all.

48:01.236 --> 48:04.238
I don't have to know anymore.

48:04.305 --> 48:07.374
I just don't want to.

48:21.824 --> 48:24.559
Carrie knows, right?

48:25.594 --> 48:27.528
She knows everything about you.

48:31.566 --> 48:33.466
She accepts it.

48:40.674 --> 48:42.741
(voice breaking):
You must love her a lot.

49:01.996 --> 49:03.997
What will we tell the kids?

49:04.065 --> 49:06.399
(sighs)

49:06.467 --> 49:10.103
Nothing they don't already know.

49:35.128 --> 49:37.029
(crickets chirping)

49:45.105 --> 49:47.040
(door closes)

49:50.311 --> 49:52.212
(sighs heavily)

50:02.857 --> 50:04.759
(doorbell rings)

50:07.229 --> 50:09.130
(doorbell rings)

50:25.814 --> 50:28.315
(sighs)

50:28.383 --> 50:30.317
He's dead.

50:30.385 --> 50:31.886
I know.

50:34.690 --> 50:37.191
Can't do any more damage.

50:37.259 --> 50:39.160
To anyone.

50:43.398 --> 50:45.800
What I did

50:45.867 --> 50:48.603
to get Nazir to let you go...

50:53.508 --> 50:55.609
It was you or Walden, Carrie.

51:09.092 --> 51:12.527
It wasn't even close.

51:30.813 --> 51:32.713
(door closes)

51:33.848 --> 51:35.783
(sighs)
