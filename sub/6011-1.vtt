01:46.679 --> 01:49.039
I'll have to go.
Of course you must go.

01:49.079 --> 01:53.399
Oh, but who'll give the letter
to her ladyship?

01:53.439 --> 01:57.439
Oh, I can do that and I'll take
her breakfast and dress her today,

01:57.479 --> 02:00.399
but I haven't got time
to make it a regular thing.

02:00.439 --> 02:03.839
No, I can do it until she finds
someone else. Lady Mary won't mind.

02:07.679 --> 02:10.719
What's the matter with you?
Miss O'Brien's upped and left!

02:10.854 --> 02:12.174
Never!

02:14.774 --> 02:16.174
Jimmy!

02:16.214 --> 02:18.214
Jimmy. Miss O'Brien's gone!

02:18.254 --> 02:20.454
What? Gone where?
How should I know?

02:20.494 --> 02:23.654
Madge, O'Brien's gone.

02:25.094 --> 02:27.374
- Have you heard?
- Heard what?

02:27.414 --> 02:30.734
- Miss O'Brien? She's gone.
- What do you mean gone?

02:30.774 --> 02:32.134
She's left.
Left?

02:32.174 --> 02:33.374
She's packed up.

02:44.494 --> 02:46.414
I can't believe it.

02:46.454 --> 02:50.494
I can. Sneaking off like a thief
in the night, that's O'Brien to a T.

02:50.534 --> 02:52.974
I just can't believe
Susan has done this to me.

02:53.014 --> 02:57.014
Miss O'Brien did say that she got on
very well with Lady Flintshire

02:57.054 --> 02:58.494
when she was up in Scotland.

02:58.534 --> 03:00.454
So I gather!

03:00.494 --> 03:03.734
"Lady Flintshire has booked
my ticket for India

03:03.774 --> 03:05.934
"and it seems too good
a chance to miss."

03:07.534 --> 03:08.814
Was there really no warning?

03:08.854 --> 03:12.734
Now I think of it,
she'd a telegram yesterday.

03:12.774 --> 03:15.254
That must have been it.

03:15.294 --> 03:17.294
So what happens now?

03:17.334 --> 03:19.494
I'll dress you today, m'lady,

03:19.534 --> 03:23.614
and Anna will take over tomorrow,
until you find a replacement.

03:26.174 --> 03:28.374
And she really gave no clue?

03:28.414 --> 03:31.094
She didn't say anything to me,
Mr Carson, not a word.

03:31.134 --> 03:32.894
As long as she didn't.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.974
I know you all think she must have
said summat, but she didn't.

03:38.014 --> 03:39.974
I believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

03:40.014 --> 03:42.214
She may be my aunt
but she's a dark horse.

03:42.254 --> 03:44.854
No-one will contradict you there.

03:49.414 --> 03:52.054
Susan Flintshire
has stolen Mama's maid

03:52.094 --> 03:54.294
whilst her daughter's
a guest in this house?

03:54.334 --> 03:56.254
I'm sure she wouldn't
put it like that.

03:56.294 --> 03:58.974
I don't care how she puts it.
It's absolutely disgraceful.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.614
It's all right. Madge told me.
It is NOT all right.

04:04.654 --> 04:07.254
Did you have any idea?
No. Not really.

04:07.294 --> 04:11.734
I knew, I knew that Mummy thought
O'Brien was very good at doing hair,

04:11.774 --> 04:14.054
and they talked about her
wanting to travel...

04:14.094 --> 04:17.014
What? When?
When you were all at Duneagle.

04:18.053 --> 04:19.733
And you didn't think to inform us?

04:19.774 --> 04:23.334
I'm in London tomorrow. I can put
an advertisement in The Lady.

04:23.374 --> 04:24.654
Good.

04:24.694 --> 04:28.374
Won't it take forever, waiting for
the magazine to come out?

04:28.414 --> 04:30.054
It can't be helped.

04:30.094 --> 04:31.574
We're meeting Trent at eleven.

04:31.614 --> 04:34.654
I'll see you there. I want to walk
the plantations first.

04:34.694 --> 04:37.174
I was wondering if Mary
might like to come.

04:37.214 --> 04:40.574
Don't bother Mary.
She's got enough on her plate.

04:43.374 --> 04:45.414
Did you really not know anything?

04:46.734 --> 04:48.734
I never thought
she'd go through with it.

04:53.614 --> 04:56.254
I thought you might like
to take this down with you.

04:56.294 --> 04:58.894
In case you want a walk.
It's quite chilly.

04:58.934 --> 05:00.374
Where's the black one?

05:07.654 --> 05:10.414
I'm taking Master George out
for some air, m'lady,

05:10.454 --> 05:12.534
and I wondered if you'd
like to come with us.

05:12.574 --> 05:16.094
I don't think so, but thank you.

05:16.134 --> 05:18.254
Poor little orphan.

05:20.494 --> 05:22.214
Thank you, Nanny.

05:28.014 --> 05:30.734
He's not an orphan.
He's got his mother.

05:30.774 --> 05:32.374
Orphans haven't.

05:32.414 --> 05:34.694
He isn't poor either, come to that.

05:37.054 --> 05:40.214
And you don't mind
my seeing to her ladyship?

05:40.254 --> 05:44.334
Why would I mind? I'm not planning
a trip round the world.

05:54.094 --> 05:58.214
Mr Molesley. Have you seen Mr Travis?

05:58.254 --> 06:01.894
I need to speak to him about
the Bring and Buy Sale.

06:01.934 --> 06:04.694
I'm afraid not, your ladyship.

06:04.734 --> 06:06.654
Never mind.

06:08.534 --> 06:11.014
This were a sad business.

06:11.054 --> 06:13.214
Very, very sad.

06:13.254 --> 06:16.094
I can't believe it's time
for the stone already.

06:16.134 --> 06:17.614
Six months.

06:17.654 --> 06:20.414
They always leave six months
for the grave to settle.

06:23.534 --> 06:26.694
Tell me has, has your son
found another job, yet?

06:26.734 --> 06:28.054
No, m'lady.

06:28.094 --> 06:31.974
They've let him stay on and he
always tries to make himself useful,

06:32.014 --> 06:35.974
but it can't go on forever
and anyway, he's lost his wage.

06:36.014 --> 06:39.534
But he's a properly trained valet!
He could even be a butler.

06:39.574 --> 06:41.214
I hope so, m'lady...

06:43.254 --> 06:46.094
..but it's a changing world.

06:46.134 --> 06:48.454
You don't have to tell me.

06:57.054 --> 06:58.894
Hello.

07:00.254 --> 07:03.614
It'll soon be time for you
to get out and walk, young lady.

07:03.654 --> 07:06.534
Please don't touch the children,
not without my permission.

07:06.574 --> 07:07.734
What?

07:07.774 --> 07:10.694
They are in my charge
and I cannot be too careful.

07:12.094 --> 07:15.214
I would remind you that I knew
this young girl's mother,

07:15.254 --> 07:16.574
which you never did.

07:16.614 --> 07:18.734
That doesn't make you her friend.

07:18.774 --> 07:20.774
As a matter of fact, it does.

07:20.814 --> 07:24.694
Well, I can't stay here
to bandy words.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.414
Will you ask Mrs Patmore

07:26.454 --> 07:29.054
to send up the children's luncheon
in half an hour?

07:29.094 --> 07:31.694
Ask her yourself, why don't you?

07:37.974 --> 07:40.334
Was her ladyship very disappointed?

07:40.374 --> 07:44.654
She was, and it'll take quite
a while to find a replacement.

07:44.694 --> 07:47.294
I can't believe Miss O'Brien
would be so thoughtless.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.134
Can't you? I can.

07:49.174 --> 07:51.414
She wants an adventure.
What's wrong with that?

07:51.454 --> 07:52.854
I don't blame her.

07:52.894 --> 07:55.774
Not for wanting to go, but why
run off and leave us in the lurch?

07:55.814 --> 07:58.974
You're talking like that
so we'll think you didn't know.

07:59.014 --> 08:00.694
That's not kind!

08:00.734 --> 08:03.334
What's the good of a month
of sour looks? Good luck to her.

08:03.374 --> 08:06.054
How was Lady Mary this morning?
The same.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.934
But, I suppose she must
come out of it eventually.

08:08.974 --> 08:11.374
For Master George's sake,
if for no other reason.

08:11.414 --> 08:15.054
I hope so. Right now, she prefers
to leave it all to Nanny West.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.774
I couldn't be a nanny.

08:16.814 --> 08:19.894
Why not? Don't you like children?
No, I do.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.254
Being a nanny you're not one of
the family but not one of us either.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.014
What are you talking about?
Being a nanny.

08:26.054 --> 08:28.734
Daisy was saying she thinks
it must be a lonely life.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.374
I don't know about that.

08:30.414 --> 08:33.254
But if you ask me, that Nanny West
thinks too much of herself.

08:33.294 --> 08:36.254
Why? What's she done?
She always seems nice to me.

08:36.294 --> 08:38.254
She only tried to give me orders.

08:38.294 --> 08:40.374
You mean she mistook you
for a servant?

08:40.414 --> 08:43.933
But he IS a servant. Don't tell him.
He'll never get over the shock!

08:47.334 --> 08:49.414
Thank you, Mr Marsh.

08:51.454 --> 08:53.974
He was bound
to be disappointed.

08:54.014 --> 08:56.254
You're sure you want to
abandon the whole plan?

08:56.294 --> 08:57.974
We don't have a choice.

08:58.014 --> 09:00.574
We have to find the death duties
on half the estate.

09:00.614 --> 09:02.534
They'll be merciless.
I know.

09:02.574 --> 09:05.414
But, I wish we could wait for Mary
to come back into play.

09:05.454 --> 09:06.894
She isn't a player.

09:06.934 --> 09:10.294
She has a life interest in one third
of Matthew's share of Downton,

09:10.334 --> 09:12.414
and a third of his
other possessions,

09:12.454 --> 09:14.814
but everything else
belongs to little George.

09:14.854 --> 09:18.054
And that's all the law gives her?
He should have made a will.

09:18.094 --> 09:20.054
But, Mary's George's guardian.

09:20.094 --> 09:22.294
Surely that gives her
some sort of say?

09:22.334 --> 09:23.814
It's a moot point.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.094
Since I own the other
half of everything,

09:26.134 --> 09:29.654
isn't it more appropriate for me
to manage the boy's fortunes?

09:29.694 --> 09:33.054
Besides, she's in such
a fragile state,

09:33.094 --> 09:36.014
the last thing I want is for her
to start worrying about money.

09:36.054 --> 09:39.494
Of course. But you don't think...?
You've seen her!

09:39.534 --> 09:42.814
She hardly has the energy
to lift a fork to her mouth.

09:42.854 --> 09:44.454
She loved him very much.

09:44.494 --> 09:47.774
And the price of great love is
great misery when one of you dies.

09:49.374 --> 09:51.574
I know that.
Of course you do.

09:51.614 --> 09:53.454
I'm so sorry.

09:53.494 --> 09:56.334
We better get back
or we'll be late for lunch.

10:01.454 --> 10:04.694
I've placed advertisements,
Mr Carson, you know I have.

10:04.734 --> 10:08.094
But the answers weren't suitable?
I didn't get any answers.

10:08.134 --> 10:11.494
Well, I did, but when I wrote back,
I heard nothing more.

10:11.534 --> 10:14.174
Well, I don't know what to suggest.

10:15.654 --> 10:19.054
Because, I can't stay here?

10:19.094 --> 10:23.454
Mr Molesley, I should hate us
to appear inhospitable.

10:23.494 --> 10:25.014
But I can't stay here.

10:25.054 --> 10:29.214
Is it fair on his lordship?
It has been six months.

10:30.534 --> 10:34.214
I suppose I could go to my dad's
until I get something sorted.

10:34.254 --> 10:35.774
What a good idea.

10:35.814 --> 10:39.014
Servants' lunch is on the table.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

10:43.334 --> 10:47.054
Oh cheer up, Mr Molesley.
It may never happen.

10:47.094 --> 10:48.774
It already has.

10:51.494 --> 10:54.614
I'm going into Thirsk after lunch.
Do you want to come?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.934
I'm walking down to the village
to see how Isobel's getting on.

10:57.974 --> 11:01.054
Remind her it's an open invitation,
if she wants to see her grandson

11:01.094 --> 11:03.214
or feels like company,
she just has to turn up.

11:03.254 --> 11:04.454
I'll tell her.

11:04.494 --> 11:06.814
I might come with you.
I don't think so.

11:06.854 --> 11:09.214
I don't think she's up
to seeing many people.

11:09.254 --> 11:10.894
I only meant into the village.

11:10.934 --> 11:13.254
Edith, are you really going
to London tomorrow?

11:13.294 --> 11:15.534
I have a couple of errands
if you are.

11:15.574 --> 11:19.494
I'm seeing Michael Gregson.
He must have missed you.

11:19.534 --> 11:23.494
He's giving a party to introduce me
to his literary friends.

11:23.534 --> 11:26.254
How exciting. Isn't it, Robert?

11:39.454 --> 11:43.134
I... I was wondering if I might
put a card in your window.

11:43.174 --> 11:46.614
A card, m'lady?
For a job asking for applicants.

11:46.654 --> 11:50.134
And what sort of job might this be?
Why? Does it make a difference?

11:50.174 --> 11:52.974
No, I suppose not.
Thank you.

11:53.014 --> 11:56.254
Erm, how much will that be?
Sixpence should cover it.

12:01.814 --> 12:04.614
You ought to see more of George.

12:04.654 --> 12:06.574
Poor George.

12:06.614 --> 12:09.374
What a burden he is born into.

12:09.414 --> 12:13.734
A baby rich as Croesus
and a mother almost passed over.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.534
That's the law.

12:15.574 --> 12:17.534
It seems so strange.

12:18.534 --> 12:21.654
Matthew was always so meticulous.

12:21.694 --> 12:25.454
He thought that death
was many years away.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.974
And so it should have been.

12:29.014 --> 12:33.334
If there's anything I can do to help,
please let me do it.

12:34.934 --> 12:36.294
I'm grateful.

12:41.654 --> 12:44.374
But you see,
when your only child dies...

12:46.974 --> 12:48.974
..then you're not a mother any more.

12:50.534 --> 12:52.254
You're not anything, really.

12:54.014 --> 12:56.294
That's what I'm trying
to get used to.

12:56.334 --> 12:58.094
You're a grandmother.

12:59.294 --> 13:01.894
And I know you're going to be
a wonderful one.

13:11.854 --> 13:14.414
Afternoon post.
Ah, thank you.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.734
Oh, not this again.

13:18.774 --> 13:20.574
Not what?

13:22.054 --> 13:24.694
Oh... nothing!

13:25.854 --> 13:28.054
Let me know when
the upholsterer arrives.

13:28.094 --> 13:30.694
I want to be there when you
explain the job in hand.

13:30.734 --> 13:32.774
Very well, but I can easily manage.

13:32.814 --> 13:36.494
He needs to grasp the quality
of the tapestry on the chairs,

13:36.534 --> 13:38.814
before he starts
slamming nails into them.

13:38.854 --> 13:41.054
And I couldn't make him see that?

14:15.134 --> 14:17.174
Just closing, love.

14:17.214 --> 14:20.374
I only wanted to know who was
looking for a lady's maid.

14:20.414 --> 14:23.014
There's not too many in Downton
who need a lady's maid.

14:23.054 --> 14:24.854
You mean the Abbey?

14:24.894 --> 14:27.294
Didn't you used to work there?

14:27.334 --> 14:30.454
I did, but I've been
studying since then.

14:30.494 --> 14:34.254
Studying for what?
To become a lady's maid.

14:37.030 --> 14:41.510
Madge says that Lady Edith
saw Mrs Crawley this afternoon.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.630
How is she?
In a very dark place, I'm afraid.

14:45.670 --> 14:47.550
And no wonder.

14:47.590 --> 14:50.750
For a widowed mother
to lose an only son...

14:50.790 --> 14:53.670
There's no more fit person
to comfort her than you.

14:53.710 --> 14:55.470
I wonder.

14:55.510 --> 14:59.030
If Lady Sybil had been an only child
I believe I'd have died.

14:59.070 --> 15:03.070
No, m'lady.
You would have lived on for the baby.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.390
And so must she.

15:08.790 --> 15:12.710
Thank you so much, Mrs Hughes,
and good night to you.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.350
Good night, m'lady.

15:14.390 --> 15:15.590
M'lord.

15:18.630 --> 15:19.750
Are you all right?

15:19.790 --> 15:23.630
I feel we must settle the question of
who is to manage the baby's property.

15:23.670 --> 15:26.670
I don't want to hurry Mary
before she's ready.

15:26.710 --> 15:31.030
What question? She's George's
mother and his guardian.

15:31.070 --> 15:35.750
Of course she is, but when it comes
to decisions about the estate,

15:35.790 --> 15:37.350
shouldn't it be me?

15:37.390 --> 15:38.670
Why?

15:38.710 --> 15:42.670
Because, together, my grandson and I
own five sixths of Downton.

15:42.710 --> 15:44.550
Mary's share is only for her life.

15:44.590 --> 15:46.870
She couldn't do much with it
even if she wanted to.

15:48.350 --> 15:51.910
The point being that with
the death duties we're facing,

15:51.950 --> 15:53.950
there are some big decisions ahead.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.430
You want to push Mary out.

15:55.470 --> 15:58.030
I'm not pushing her out.
She was never "in."

15:58.070 --> 16:01.070
Matthew was co-owner
and now his son is.

16:01.110 --> 16:05.550
I worked with Matthew.
I must work for his boy.

16:17.030 --> 16:18.310
Thanks.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.870
A lot of letters for a Tuesday.

16:21.910 --> 16:25.470
How do people have time to write
when the week is just beginning?

16:25.510 --> 16:27.590
It's Saint Valentine's Day.

16:27.630 --> 16:31.390
Oh, imagine your remembering that
and my forgetting it.

16:31.430 --> 16:33.190
Who would have thought such a thing?

16:33.230 --> 16:35.630
I am not a complete stranger
to romance

16:35.670 --> 16:37.230
if that's what you're implying.

16:38.270 --> 16:41.830
Maybe I am now, but I wasn't always.

16:43.790 --> 16:46.950
Hold on.
I thought these were all bills.

16:46.990 --> 16:49.230
Daisy! This one's for you.

16:51.390 --> 16:54.790
Daisy? Who's that from?
Don't tease her, Mr Barrow.

16:58.390 --> 16:59.870
Who sent you a card?

16:59.910 --> 17:02.870
I don't know. It's not signed.

17:02.910 --> 17:06.470
Nor's mine.
We both must have secret admirers.

17:06.510 --> 17:08.550
Which is no more than we deserve.

17:14.109 --> 17:17.470
That's enough of that, Mr Bates.
We've work to do.

17:31.870 --> 17:33.590
What's that?

17:33.630 --> 17:35.790
Nothing.

17:37.350 --> 17:40.390
Of course. It's Valentine's Day.

17:42.630 --> 17:46.030
When are you leaving for London?
I'm catching the ten o'clock.

17:50.910 --> 17:52.630
I ought to pack.

17:55.310 --> 17:57.190
Have a happy time.

18:27.590 --> 18:29.230
Just down there.

18:39.670 --> 18:41.350
Mr Grigg?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.470
Do I know you?

18:51.710 --> 18:54.830
You wrote to Charlie Carson
at Downton Abbey.

18:56.910 --> 18:58.670
I work with him.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.750
Did he send you?

19:00.790 --> 19:03.670
Not exactly. In a way.

19:11.670 --> 19:14.990
What... What did he say about me?

19:15.030 --> 19:16.910
What does he plan to do?

19:16.950 --> 19:21.830
Mr Carson is very busy.
He wanted me to find out how you are.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.590
Then, I think
he'll come up with a plan.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.630
I knew it.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.470
He said some harsh things
when we last met,

19:30.510 --> 19:33.990
but, we go back a long way,
Charlie and me.

19:34.950 --> 19:36.830
And whatever's happened,

19:36.870 --> 19:40.990
to theatre folk like us,
that means something.

19:42.070 --> 19:44.910
Yes, I'm sure it does.

20:13.830 --> 20:15.990
Thank you, Madam.
Thank you.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.430
This is very lovely.

20:18.470 --> 20:21.950
Shouldn't you be at the office?
Aunt Rosamund's sending her car.

20:21.990 --> 20:25.910
I've missed you. I haven't stopped
thinking about you for one moment.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.510
Well, I'm here now.

20:27.550 --> 20:30.830
I couldn't be more thrilled
because I've got some news...

20:30.870 --> 20:34.510
Well, not news, more an idea.
Go on.

20:34.550 --> 20:35.830
I've done some research,

20:35.870 --> 20:38.470
and discovered not every country
is the same as England.

20:38.510 --> 20:39.750
You amaze me!

20:39.790 --> 20:43.270
No, I mean there are places where
lunacy is grounds for divorce,

20:43.310 --> 20:46.430
Portugal and Greece
and even Germany.

20:46.470 --> 20:49.190
But, wouldn't you have to live there?

20:49.230 --> 20:51.790
No, no, I'm just finding out
what's involved.

20:51.830 --> 20:55.430
But if I did live in Germany,
would you come with me?

20:57.270 --> 20:59.230
Oh. Hello, Burns.

21:00.270 --> 21:02.670
This is Burns,
Aunt Rosamund's chauffeur.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.630
Good afternoon, m'lady.

21:07.150 --> 21:08.710
Can I give you a lift?

21:08.750 --> 21:11.030
I'll take a taxi.
It's the opposite direction.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.950
I'll see you tonight.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.430
Oh. Am I too early?

21:21.470 --> 21:23.910
No. I'm afraid tea
was a little late.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.110
Oh, dear. Can you manage?
Should I give you a hand?

21:27.150 --> 21:29.430
I can manage, thank you, Miss West.

21:29.470 --> 21:31.510
Come to me, darling.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.030
Hello.

21:33.070 --> 21:37.710
Now, here's the little Prince,
m'lady.

21:40.110 --> 21:43.470
See how happy he is to see his
beautiful Mama?

21:43.510 --> 21:45.430
God bless him.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.870
Thank you, Nanny.

21:49.390 --> 21:52.630
You say you have no purpose,

21:52.670 --> 21:55.230
but what about little George?

21:55.270 --> 21:57.030
Surely you're interested in him?

21:57.070 --> 22:01.430
Of course, but I'm not going to
drive Mary mad by interfering.

22:01.470 --> 22:04.430
It's the job of grandmothers
to interfere.

22:05.710 --> 22:07.910
Oh, that's Molesley.

22:07.950 --> 22:11.110
He asked to see me and I told him
when he could come.

22:11.150 --> 22:13.390
Oh? Well, may I stay?

22:13.430 --> 22:15.990
Or is it a secret assignation?

22:18.910 --> 22:21.990
Oh. I'm very sorry to interrupt
your ladyship.

22:22.030 --> 22:23.790
What is it, Molesley?

22:25.230 --> 22:29.150
I came to ask if you'd consider
giving me my old job back.

22:31.190 --> 22:34.830
I apologise for forcing myself
on a private conversation.

22:34.870 --> 22:36.070
I will go.

22:36.110 --> 22:38.550
No please, m'lady.
There's no mystery.

22:38.590 --> 22:43.110
I've lost my job, because,
well, for obvious reasons

22:43.150 --> 22:45.870
and I thought I'd ask here.

22:48.270 --> 22:51.510
The trouble is,
I have no need for a butler.

22:51.550 --> 22:55.270
These days I'm just an old widow
who eats off a tray.

22:55.310 --> 22:56.350
I see.

22:56.390 --> 23:00.590
Just because you're an old widow,
I see no necessity to eat off a tray.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.470
You and I are different.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.710
Yes, that is very true.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.110
I'm wasting your time.

23:06.150 --> 23:08.790
Should, should we hear
of an opening...

23:09.790 --> 23:11.150
..where would we find you?

23:11.190 --> 23:13.070
I'm moving to
my father's house, m'lady.

23:37.030 --> 23:40.190
Have you had any more time
to think about what I said?

23:40.230 --> 23:42.870
You mean our living in sin?

23:42.910 --> 23:46.190
We'd only live in sin as you call it,
until the divorce.

23:47.390 --> 23:49.150
Don't you want to be with me?

23:50.030 --> 23:53.670
You know I do. More than anything.

23:59.830 --> 24:03.710
Erm, is there any more gin, sir?
We're running rather low.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.670
Yes, I'll er, I'll have a look.

24:30.110 --> 24:31.830
Oh, my Lord!

24:38.590 --> 24:42.070
This is an honour, your ladyship.
I have a message for your son.

24:42.110 --> 24:45.390
Lady Shackleton is
joining me for luncheon.

24:45.430 --> 24:47.310
I want him to come and help.

24:47.350 --> 24:49.470
But, what about Mr Spratt?

24:49.510 --> 24:51.910
Well, Spratt will be there,
of course,

24:51.950 --> 24:54.990
but Molesley can still
take an active part.

24:56.110 --> 25:00.750
Lady Shackleton tells me
her butler is retiring.

25:00.790 --> 25:03.150
Won't she have made arrangements
to find another?

25:03.190 --> 25:04.670
But that is the point.

25:04.710 --> 25:07.710
She hasn't yet decided
whether to replace him or not,

25:07.750 --> 25:11.830
so if Molesley can
demonstrate his skills...

25:12.790 --> 25:14.830
Mr Spratt won't mind?

25:14.870 --> 25:17.190
It is not his business to mind.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.030
No. Well...

25:19.070 --> 25:21.750
Very good, m'lady.
Thank you very much.

25:31.339 --> 25:33.959
You took a letter out
of my waste paper basket

25:33.980 --> 25:36.560
when I had clearly crumpled it
and thrown it away?

25:36.613 --> 25:39.373
I could see it had upset you.
I wanted to know why.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.653
I'm sure.

25:40.693 --> 25:45.133
But it didn't occur to you it might
not be your concern WHY I was upset?

25:45.173 --> 25:47.973
Well, anyway, I did it and I read it
and I went to see him!

25:50.133 --> 25:52.053
Don't you want to know how he is?

25:52.933 --> 25:56.373
If I wanted to know how he is,
I would have answered his letter.

25:56.413 --> 25:59.133
Mr Carson, he's in the workhouse!

26:01.573 --> 26:03.973
And in case you're wondering,

26:04.013 --> 26:08.373
it's as bad as if we were reading
about it in a novel by Dickens.

26:08.413 --> 26:10.373
Haven't they closed the workhouses?

26:10.413 --> 26:13.173
No. They haven't. Not all of them.

26:14.333 --> 26:18.133
Well, at least he's in the dry.

26:18.173 --> 26:22.693
If you can call it dry when there's
mould in the very air you breathe.

26:22.733 --> 26:25.493
This is a man
you sang and danced with.

26:25.533 --> 26:27.853
Do you feel nothing?

26:27.893 --> 26:30.893
I don't feel I could be helpful, no.

26:30.933 --> 26:33.293
And I would thank you
not to remind me

26:33.333 --> 26:36.493
of a time in my life
I prefer to forget.

26:38.333 --> 26:40.533
But why would we need it?

26:40.573 --> 26:43.973
It's a mixer. It beats eggs
and whips cream and all sorts.

26:44.013 --> 26:45.573
But you and Ivy do that!

26:45.613 --> 26:47.773
And we'd be glad not to,
thank you very much.

26:47.813 --> 26:51.093
Did Lady Edith say why she got it?
Her ladyship asked her to.

26:51.133 --> 26:55.053
She wants to save us a bit of
elbow grease. You don't understand!

26:55.093 --> 26:56.613
Before too long,

26:56.653 --> 27:00.093
her ladyship could run the kitchen
with a woman from the village.

27:00.133 --> 27:04.733
What with these toasters and mixers
and such like, we'd be out of a job.

27:04.773 --> 27:08.093
I want to try it.
Then on your own head be it!

27:10.333 --> 27:12.813
Did you like your card, Ivy?
What's it to you?

27:12.853 --> 27:14.413
That'd be telling.

27:14.453 --> 27:16.493
Don't listen. He's just teasing.

27:16.533 --> 27:20.453
Come on. Clear out, you two.
There's work to be done.

27:20.493 --> 27:23.213
Do you think that means
that Jimmy sent it?

27:23.253 --> 27:25.293
Maybe he thinks it fun to tease.

27:25.333 --> 27:27.053
But, don't you see?

27:27.093 --> 27:29.973
If Jimmy sent mine,
then who sent yours?

27:36.093 --> 27:39.253
Thomas?
Mr Barrow to you.

27:39.293 --> 27:41.013
Can you tell Mrs Patmore

27:41.053 --> 27:43.813
I won't want the scrambled egg
for Miss Sybbie's tea.

27:43.853 --> 27:47.013
If you go through here and down the
stairs, you can tell her yourself.

27:47.053 --> 27:50.813
Do it. Please. I can't stop.
The children are on their own.

27:52.173 --> 27:55.773
Why did I struggle across London
if Rose was going to sort it out?

27:55.813 --> 27:57.453
You had other things to do.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.813
It doesn't explain why Rose put
the card in the Post Office window.

28:01.853 --> 28:03.493
I just thought how much quicker

28:03.533 --> 28:05.853
it would be if we could
find someone local.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.453
I do feel responsible.

28:07.493 --> 28:08.893
Have you had any answers yet?

28:08.933 --> 28:12.693
We've had three and one's promising,
so we'll see her in Ripon on Friday.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.853
Why isn't she coming here?

28:14.893 --> 28:17.253
She's looking after her aunt,
she can't get away.

28:17.293 --> 28:19.573
It's time for you
to come back to us.

28:19.613 --> 28:21.413
What would you suggest?

28:21.453 --> 28:25.013
Take an interest in something,
doesn't matter what.

28:25.053 --> 28:29.093
Poetry... or carpentry.

28:29.133 --> 28:32.333
History or hats.
I'm interested in George.

28:33.333 --> 28:34.813
Are you?

28:34.853 --> 28:36.333
I will be.

28:37.813 --> 28:39.933
What have you been doing today?

28:39.973 --> 28:43.293
Well, it's this whole business
with the repair shop.

28:43.333 --> 28:46.493
Tom, don't bore her
with all that nonsense.

28:46.533 --> 28:48.933
It's my fault. I asked.
Even so.

28:48.973 --> 28:51.013
You concentrate on feeling better.

28:51.053 --> 28:53.853
You mustn't worry about
anything else.

28:59.053 --> 29:01.253
Did you send a Valentine's card?

29:01.293 --> 29:02.493
Suppose I did.

29:02.533 --> 29:04.693
Was it to Ivy?
That's my business.

29:04.733 --> 29:07.133
You didn't really
send Ivy a card?

29:07.173 --> 29:08.653
Is it likely?

29:08.693 --> 29:10.693
I sent one to Lady Anstruther.

29:10.733 --> 29:13.173
I worked for her and
she's coming back from France.

29:13.213 --> 29:14.733
She might be useful.

29:14.773 --> 29:19.333
Wasn't that a bit forward?
Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

29:20.413 --> 29:22.493
To be honest, Mrs Hughes,

29:22.533 --> 29:24.813
I don't see that
it's any of my business.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.933
That's something I never thought
I'd hear you say, ma'am.

29:30.213 --> 29:34.773
A wretched man is in the workhouse
and he reaches out to us for rescue.

29:34.813 --> 29:38.813
Well, he reached out to Carson.
I don't see what you want me to do.

29:38.853 --> 29:41.053
Mrs Crawley, I...

29:41.093 --> 29:43.173
I wondered
if I could bring him here.

29:43.213 --> 29:44.693
Here?

29:44.733 --> 29:47.933
If you and I were to vouch for him
to the authorities,

29:47.973 --> 29:50.293
I'm sure we could get him
away from that place.

29:50.333 --> 29:55.053
But why here? Why not the Abbey?
Isn't he Carson's responsibility?

29:55.093 --> 30:00.173
I'm sorry to say it, but, Mr Carson
has turned his back on his old pal.

30:00.213 --> 30:02.133
I see.

30:02.173 --> 30:06.613
So you want to risk Carson's wrath
by rescuing this Mr Grigg?

30:06.653 --> 30:11.293
He's a pitiful being,
but he's not beyond work.

30:11.333 --> 30:15.293
He's not beyond a decent life,
if he could find it.

30:16.813 --> 30:21.373
You see, in my present state,
I don't think I'm strong enough...

30:21.413 --> 30:22.733
But you are, ma'am!

30:22.773 --> 30:25.933
If you could just
set aside your grief,

30:25.973 --> 30:28.693
and use that strength
for another's good.

30:36.933 --> 30:39.093
Mr Branson.
Mr Carson.

30:40.813 --> 30:43.093
I know you won't think it correct,

30:43.133 --> 30:46.413
but I need to ask your help
in a difficult situation.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.373
My help, sir?
Lord Grantham is against me in this.

30:49.413 --> 30:51.573
With Matthew gone,
I've no-one else to turn to.

30:52.773 --> 30:57.533
Mary, that is, Lady Mary,
is not improving.

30:57.573 --> 31:00.773
She's suffered a terrible tragedy.
Of course.

31:00.813 --> 31:02.453
But it's six months now,

31:02.493 --> 31:05.013
and she's no better than she was
a week after he died.

31:05.053 --> 31:09.133
The only way is for her to find
an interest outside of herself,

31:09.173 --> 31:12.053
and I know that should be
in the running of the estate.

31:12.093 --> 31:14.253
What does his lordship think?

31:14.293 --> 31:17.533
Lord Grantham thinks his duty
is to protect Mary and her son

31:17.573 --> 31:19.253
by managing everything himself.

31:19.293 --> 31:21.733
And he won't listen to you
on the subject?

31:21.773 --> 31:23.813
He sees her as a little woman,

31:23.853 --> 31:26.933
who shouldn't be troubled by
anything so harsh as reality.

31:31.613 --> 31:35.293
And even were I to agree with you...

31:36.493 --> 31:37.933
..how could I help?

31:39.253 --> 31:42.253
Give her advice.
She'd take it from you.

31:42.293 --> 31:44.573
What makes you say that?

31:44.613 --> 31:47.813
Because she knows you only
want the best for her.

31:52.613 --> 31:54.973
I'm going down to the pub tonight.
When?

31:55.013 --> 31:57.533
After our supper. I'm bored.
I want to stretch my legs.

31:57.573 --> 31:59.933
You can't. It's not your day off.

31:59.973 --> 32:01.573
I can go for a walk, can't I?

32:07.533 --> 32:10.533
- I could never do that.
- Don't be so soft.

32:10.573 --> 32:13.413
I couldn't. I'd keep thinking
I were going to be electrocuted.

32:13.453 --> 32:15.653
You should have more faith.
More courage!

32:15.693 --> 32:19.613
How about some Dutch courage, Ivy?
Why not come with me, tonight?

32:19.653 --> 32:22.973
What? Me go to a pub?

32:23.013 --> 32:25.293
Without leave? You must be mad.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.653
Don't you ever want to
take a chance in life?

32:27.693 --> 32:28.933
When would we be back?

32:28.973 --> 32:31.813
You're not thinking of going?!
I don't know.

32:31.853 --> 32:33.853
I never do anything
I'm not supposed to.

32:33.893 --> 32:36.533
What are you not supposed to do?
Nothing.

32:36.573 --> 32:39.733
What's going on there?
I'm making the mousse for tonight.

32:39.773 --> 32:43.133
Oh, my God. Well, we'd better have
some soup put by.

32:43.173 --> 32:45.253
I'd rather not rely on
that contraption.

32:53.893 --> 32:57.093
Can I help you?
I doubt you would if you could.

32:57.133 --> 32:58.533
I'm sorry?

32:58.573 --> 33:03.013
Why didn't you give my instructions
to Mrs Patmore about the eggs?

33:03.053 --> 33:05.933
Because I didn't feel like it.

33:05.973 --> 33:10.253
Besides, why can't Miss Sybbie
have an egg to her tea?

33:10.293 --> 33:13.333
I don't have to explain
my decisions to you.

33:13.373 --> 33:15.653
You're a member of staff,

33:15.693 --> 33:18.733
and the orders I give
are to be obeyed.

33:18.773 --> 33:20.573
And aren't you a member of staff?

33:20.613 --> 33:22.573
Not in that way.

33:22.613 --> 33:27.093
Now, I believe I'm needed upstairs.

33:32.773 --> 33:34.733
May I come in?

33:34.773 --> 33:36.293
Carson?

33:37.373 --> 33:38.853
Of course.

33:40.613 --> 33:43.133
I'll leave you now, m'lady.

33:48.053 --> 33:50.133
What can I do for you?

33:50.173 --> 33:53.333
Well, I'm not sure how to start,

33:53.373 --> 33:55.573
but before I do,

33:55.613 --> 33:58.813
you must know that I would only
be as bold as this

33:58.853 --> 34:00.853
if I felt it was for your benefit.

34:01.693 --> 34:04.093
Now you're frightening me.

34:07.973 --> 34:09.333
Your ladyship...

34:10.453 --> 34:12.652
Do you have a moment?
What is it, Barrow?

34:13.693 --> 34:16.413
There's something's worrying me,
m'lady and I...

34:16.453 --> 34:19.413
I can't hold it in any more.
Why? What's happened?

34:19.453 --> 34:21.373
It's Nanny West.

34:21.413 --> 34:24.973
It seems she's been leaving
the children to their own devices.

34:25.013 --> 34:27.572
What? You mean she's
neglecting them?

34:29.253 --> 34:32.092
I wouldn't have spoken up
if it weren't for a...

34:32.132 --> 34:35.693
..a little girl and a baby boy
being put at risk.

34:39.652 --> 34:43.013
Carson, this is my fault.
My lady?

34:43.053 --> 34:45.213
I'm afraid I may have
encouraged you to feel

34:45.253 --> 34:47.333
you have the right
to address me in this way.

34:47.373 --> 34:49.773
His lordship has made a decision

34:49.813 --> 34:53.132
and I find it hard that his butler
should criticise him for it.

34:53.172 --> 34:54.652
No, I never meant...

34:54.693 --> 34:56.253
You do not seem to understand

34:56.293 --> 34:58.893
the effect Mr Crawley's death
has had on me.

34:58.933 --> 35:02.733
As for managing the estate,
I wouldn't know where to start.

35:02.773 --> 35:06.453
But Mr Branson believes you could be
very helpful, my lady,

35:06.493 --> 35:08.493
and as the agent, he should know.

35:08.533 --> 35:11.893
He's just nervous that his lordship
will retreat to his old ways

35:11.933 --> 35:14.213
and abandon all
Mr Matthew's reforms.

35:14.253 --> 35:17.973
And will he?
If he did, wouldn't you approve?

35:18.853 --> 35:20.453
Anyway, whether you approve or not,

35:20.493 --> 35:23.413
I'm sorry you feel entitled
to overstep the mark.

35:24.973 --> 35:26.093
My lady?

35:26.133 --> 35:28.453
We're old friends,

35:28.493 --> 35:33.173
and as I said, I'm sure this lapse
is as much my fault as yours.

35:35.253 --> 35:38.373
But, I suggest we don't
mention it again.

35:38.413 --> 35:40.933
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's time to go down.

35:51.493 --> 35:53.853
You're letting yourself be defeated,
my lady.

35:53.893 --> 35:57.453
I'm sorry if it's
a "lapse" to say so,

35:57.493 --> 35:59.693
but someone has to.

36:09.253 --> 36:11.893
How is the luncheon
for the tenant farmers coming along?

36:11.933 --> 36:13.333
Well, I think. Tom?

36:13.373 --> 36:16.533
They've all accepted except
for Barnes at Wheelers Wood.

36:16.573 --> 36:19.893
- He's sworn to his sister's wedding.
- I think we can forgive him.

36:19.933 --> 36:23.293
I have a feeling I've double booked.
It's this Saturday, isn't it?

36:23.333 --> 36:25.373
Don't worry.
We're not having the wives.

36:25.413 --> 36:26.613
Edith can preside.

36:26.653 --> 36:29.413
I can't I'm afraid.
I'm going up to London.

36:30.053 --> 36:32.213
Mary, then.
Me?

36:32.253 --> 36:35.573
Well, if George is owner
of half the estate now,

36:35.613 --> 36:37.213
shouldn't you represent him?

36:37.253 --> 36:39.253
Well, I...
I don't want to bother Mary.

36:39.293 --> 36:41.533
They'd like to see you.
I'm sure they would but...

36:41.573 --> 36:44.933
After all, you'll have to run it
if anything happens to Robert.

36:44.973 --> 36:47.213
Until George is of age, or longer.

36:47.253 --> 36:51.733
For heaven's sake! Why does everyone
keep nagging and nagging?

36:51.773 --> 36:56.333
My husband is dead!
Can't you understand what that means?

36:56.373 --> 37:00.413
After all he suffered in the war,
he's killed in a stupid car crash!

37:01.493 --> 37:04.733
Matthew is dead,
50 years before his time!

37:04.773 --> 37:06.573
Isn't that enough
for me to deal with?

37:06.613 --> 37:08.333
Just leave me alone!

37:11.333 --> 37:13.333
Exactly what I was afraid of.

37:14.893 --> 37:16.613
She is living a nightmare.

37:16.653 --> 37:20.413
We must all step back and allow her
to come through it in her own time.

37:20.453 --> 37:25.013
Aren't I right, Mama?
No. We can't discuss it now.

37:26.693 --> 37:31.133
This mousse is delicious, Carson,
is it the work of Mrs Patmore?

37:31.173 --> 37:32.973
I suppose she hasn't bought it in?

37:33.013 --> 37:36.013
I don't think so, your ladyship, no.

37:36.053 --> 37:39.013
Then you must be sure
to send her our compliments.

37:52.993 --> 37:57.193
What's the matter, lad?
Are you not feeling well?

37:58.633 --> 38:00.593
No, it's not that.

38:02.593 --> 38:04.953
Oh, I don't know, Dad. It's just...

38:06.473 --> 38:08.033
It's just lately I...

38:08.073 --> 38:11.793
I can't seem to see
where I'm going, I'm...

38:13.033 --> 38:16.633
You've had a shock, and no wonder.

38:16.673 --> 38:20.793
You should have been working for
Mr Matthew until you were old,

38:20.833 --> 38:23.353
maybe been butler at the Abbey
before you were done.

38:23.393 --> 38:27.433
Now all that's gone,
and your wages with it.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.833
He were a nice chap, Dad.

38:31.873 --> 38:34.273
You know, whatever
the difference between us,

38:34.313 --> 38:36.153
he were always polite, always kind.

38:36.193 --> 38:37.553
I'm glad to hear it.

38:37.593 --> 38:40.393
But, it's raised my standards,
do you see?

38:40.433 --> 38:42.553
I mean, who is this old... bat

38:42.593 --> 38:44.793
her ladyship wants me
to meet on Friday?

38:44.833 --> 38:46.593
Now, listen.

38:46.633 --> 38:51.073
In your game, if you want the best,
you've got to BE the best.

38:51.113 --> 38:52.433
And work at it!

38:53.553 --> 38:56.793
Get yourself back into service,
in a good post...

38:57.833 --> 39:00.793
..and you'll soon find your way
to where you'd like to be.

39:21.193 --> 39:23.153
I'm leaving.

39:25.833 --> 39:28.793
I didn't want to run off
without saying good night.

39:28.833 --> 39:32.113
I suppose you think I behaved
very badly down there.

39:32.153 --> 39:35.153
My dear, I'm not really
very interested

39:35.193 --> 39:37.633
in whether you behaved badly or well.

39:37.673 --> 39:40.153
No?
No.

39:40.193 --> 39:44.593
I am not your governess.
I'm your grandmother.

39:45.793 --> 39:49.313
And the difference is?
The difference is...

39:52.233 --> 39:53.433
I love you.

40:00.873 --> 40:02.713
Of course you do.

40:03.793 --> 40:05.353
I'm sorry.

40:05.433 --> 40:08.873
Mary, you've gone through
a hideous time.

40:09.753 --> 40:12.513
But now you must remember your son.

40:12.553 --> 40:15.153
He needs you... very much.

40:15.193 --> 40:16.913
I know.

40:18.193 --> 40:21.473
The truth is, I don't think
I'm going to be a very good mother.

40:22.553 --> 40:23.793
Why not?

40:23.833 --> 40:27.473
Because somehow,
with Matthew's death,

40:27.513 --> 40:29.873
all the softness that he found in me

40:29.913 --> 40:33.833
seems to have dried up
and drained away.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.193
Maybe it was only ever there
in his imagination.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.153
Now, my dear...

40:42.193 --> 40:44.753
..there's more than
one type of good mother.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.473
The fact is,

40:48.553 --> 40:52.393
you have a straightforward choice
before you.

40:56.433 --> 40:58.193
You must choose...

40:59.753 --> 41:03.633
..either death... or life.

41:03.673 --> 41:06.473
And you think I should choose life?

41:16.953 --> 41:21.673
Charlie Grigg is going
to stay with Mrs Crawley?

41:21.713 --> 41:24.353
The authorities have released him
into her charge.

41:24.393 --> 41:26.033
I'm collecting him on Friday.

41:26.073 --> 41:28.753
But why has she agreed to this?

41:28.793 --> 41:32.553
Because she is a kind woman,
and he is a man in need.

41:32.593 --> 41:37.113
I cannot believe you are imposing
on Mrs Crawley at a time like this,

41:37.153 --> 41:39.833
when she is almost broken by grief.

41:40.953 --> 41:44.833
It's BECAUSE of her grief
I am imposing.

41:45.873 --> 41:48.473
I don't understand you.
No.

41:49.473 --> 41:50.833
You wouldn't.

41:51.833 --> 41:54.033
You must forgive Mary.

41:54.073 --> 41:55.353
I do forgive her.

41:55.393 --> 41:57.553
She is broken and bruised
and it is our job

41:57.593 --> 41:59.993
to wrap her up and keep her
safe from the world.

42:00.033 --> 42:02.153
No, Robert.

42:02.193 --> 42:05.913
It is our job to bring her
back to the world.

42:05.953 --> 42:08.873
I'm afraid that is not how I see it.
Really?

42:08.913 --> 42:14.193
Then I can only say that while I will
overlook Mary's poor judgement,

42:14.233 --> 42:17.153
I find it hard to overlook yours.

42:17.193 --> 42:18.833
Goodnight.

42:19.873 --> 42:23.713
Oh, Edith, Edith,
come to luncheon on Friday.

42:23.753 --> 42:25.313
I...
I mean it.

42:25.353 --> 42:28.873
I need your help
to make things a success.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.673
Why? What are we doing?

42:30.713 --> 42:34.033
We are selling Molesley
to Lady Shackleton.

42:34.073 --> 42:35.873
You mean as a servant?

42:36.953 --> 42:40.673
No. As a Chinese laundryman!

42:46.993 --> 42:50.113
Thank God you're alone.
You've got to help me.

42:50.153 --> 42:51.993
What's the matter with you two?

42:52.033 --> 42:54.873
I don't know, but I'd better
go with him if I want to find out.

42:59.633 --> 43:03.593
Oh, my Lord, what have you done?
She got a bit tiddly down the pub.

43:03.633 --> 43:06.513
She's not tiddly. She's drunk!
He kept buying them.

43:06.553 --> 43:09.073
What were you trying to do?
Nothing.

43:09.113 --> 43:11.033
She's just not used to it.

43:11.073 --> 43:12.393
Come on.

43:14.833 --> 43:17.553
What on earth?!
Ivy's not very well.

43:17.593 --> 43:20.393
That's the understatement
of the year. Bring her inside.

43:29.753 --> 43:32.913
Has Mrs Patmore gone to bed?
She must have, thank goodness.

43:32.953 --> 43:35.633
What were you trying to do?
I wasn't trying to do anything.

43:35.673 --> 43:37.393
As long as you weren't.

43:39.273 --> 43:40.913
Here.

43:45.073 --> 43:47.633
How are you feeling?
A bit better, thank you.

43:47.673 --> 43:49.153
You could have done real damage.

43:49.193 --> 43:52.433
You come along with me now.
What about Mr Bates?

43:52.473 --> 43:54.713
Won't he be missing you?

43:54.753 --> 43:57.713
Mr Bates must wait his turn.

43:57.753 --> 43:59.993
Meant no harm, Ivy, honest.

44:00.033 --> 44:02.473
You won't say anything about this,
will you?

44:02.513 --> 44:03.833
'Course not.

44:03.873 --> 44:05.153
Come on.

44:05.193 --> 44:08.233
It wasn't deliberate, you know.

44:08.273 --> 44:11.073
I know you only pretend
to like her to tease me.

44:12.193 --> 44:14.513
Why don't you tell her
you didn't send that card?

44:22.153 --> 44:25.993
Oh good morning, Mrs Crawley.
I didn't know you were here.

44:26.033 --> 44:28.193
Alfred let me in.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.993
I wanted to see Master George,

44:31.033 --> 44:36.073
but I'm afraid... Nanny West
didn't think it a good time.

44:36.113 --> 44:38.433
Oh, er, Mrs Crawley...

44:38.473 --> 44:41.913
I understand you are offering shelter
to Mr Grigg.

44:41.953 --> 44:43.833
Yes. He's arriving this afternoon.

44:43.873 --> 44:45.993
Only I should hate to feel
you were doing this

44:46.033 --> 44:47.873
out of consideration for me.

44:47.913 --> 44:50.993
Mr Grigg is perfectly capable
of managing his own affairs.

44:51.033 --> 44:53.953
Not very successfully
if he ends up in a workhouse.

44:53.993 --> 44:57.353
I just don't want you to waste
your energy and kindness

44:57.393 --> 44:59.753
on an unworthy recipient.

44:59.793 --> 45:02.033
Not at such a time.

45:02.073 --> 45:03.313
I understand.

45:04.353 --> 45:06.113
But you see, Carson,

45:06.153 --> 45:09.953
I'd almost forgotten I had either
energy or kindness in me.

45:11.233 --> 45:13.553
So that's something, isn't it?

45:18.353 --> 45:21.713
Why is she seeing her in Ripon?
I don't know.

45:21.753 --> 45:24.193
Her ladyship won't wait for
the advertisement?

45:24.233 --> 45:27.793
She will if this one's no good,
but she wants to get on with it.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.033
How are you, Ivy?

45:32.153 --> 45:34.033
Not wonderful.

45:39.593 --> 45:41.873
I suppose we were all young once.

45:41.913 --> 45:44.473
Yes, but you stayed young.

45:44.513 --> 45:46.513
That's the difference.

45:48.793 --> 45:50.873
Forgive me, Miss Braithwaite,

45:50.913 --> 45:53.593
but I have the strangest feeling
I've seen you before.

45:53.633 --> 45:56.433
Well, yes.
I was just coming to that.

45:56.473 --> 46:00.113
You see, I worked at Downton Abbey,
but only for a short time.

46:00.153 --> 46:01.393
Why was that?

46:01.433 --> 46:03.153
I was a housemaid then, m'lady,

46:03.193 --> 46:05.633
and I was starting to feel
it was time to move on.

46:05.673 --> 46:06.713
I see.

46:06.753 --> 46:10.033
So, I took a course in hairdressing,
and I could always sew.

46:10.073 --> 46:12.233
And you got a job as a lady's maid.

46:12.273 --> 46:15.873
I did, m'lady, but it only
lasted for a few months

46:15.913 --> 46:18.233
because the old lady
I was working for died.

46:18.273 --> 46:19.873
I am sorry.

46:19.913 --> 46:23.273
I know I don't sound
very experienced, m'lady,

46:23.313 --> 46:27.313
but I'm a very hard worker and
I've practised what I've learned.

46:27.353 --> 46:31.073
Well, I shall obviously
have to talk to Mrs Hughes

46:31.113 --> 46:32.953
if you've worked for us before.

46:32.993 --> 46:35.833
She gave me a wonderful reference.

46:35.873 --> 46:37.233
When I left.

46:37.273 --> 46:41.113
That does seem very encouraging.
Please say yes, Cousin Cora.

46:43.793 --> 46:45.753
You definitely want the position?

46:45.793 --> 46:49.193
Oh, I do, m'lady.
I enjoyed Downton ever so much.

46:49.233 --> 46:52.153
It was just that the work wasn't
sufficiently demanding.

46:52.193 --> 46:53.753
When would you be able to start?

46:54.753 --> 46:56.713
Whenever you want me, your ladyship.

46:56.753 --> 46:59.993
You can make arrangements
for your aunt? My aunt?

47:00.713 --> 47:03.953
I thought that was why you couldn't
come to Downton for the interview.

47:03.993 --> 47:06.873
I'm sorry. Of course it was.
I'm quite dizzy I've got the job.

47:06.913 --> 47:09.673
Erm, yes,
I can make arrangements for my aunt.

47:09.713 --> 47:12.673
Don't worry about that.
It's settled, then.

47:19.513 --> 47:22.513
I'm perfectly capable
of serving luncheon to three ladies.

47:22.553 --> 47:24.513
So, why are you here?

47:24.553 --> 47:28.993
I've an idea that she wants to
introduce me to Lady Shackleton.

47:30.713 --> 47:33.353
Are you sure this isn't your idea?

47:34.593 --> 47:37.433
I wonder if you haven't pushed
her ladyship into it,

47:37.473 --> 47:40.073
so you could just show off
in front of her.

47:40.113 --> 47:41.953
Certainly not!

47:41.993 --> 47:44.713
I think it's my job you're after!

47:44.753 --> 47:47.913
Nothing to do with Lady Shackleton.
No!

47:47.953 --> 47:49.873
So you say.

47:54.353 --> 47:57.066
Well, I'm going to announce luncheon.

48:02.079 --> 48:05.850
But I'm warning you. That's all.

48:14.017 --> 48:17.445
My son tells me that this decision
to remove the farm subsidies

48:17.465 --> 48:21.465
has dealt a terrible blow to landed
estates up and down the country.

48:21.503 --> 48:23.554
That awful Mr Lloyd George.

48:23.719 --> 48:25.483
I agree.

48:25.525 --> 48:28.635
You know, I sometimes wonder
if he isn't really German,

48:28.675 --> 48:30.669
just pretending to be Welsh.

48:33.581 --> 48:36.612
It's nice to see you here, Molesley.

48:36.652 --> 48:40.680
Molesley's always been a great
supporter of the family.

48:40.720 --> 48:41.996
That's good to hear.

48:42.036 --> 48:44.109
Oh, yes, Granny and I
are always saying

48:44.150 --> 48:46.582
there's no-one more
reliable than Molesley.

48:46.623 --> 48:47.659
No-one.

48:47.699 --> 48:49.254
Careful, Mr Molesley!

48:49.295 --> 48:51.767
Oh? Are you quite well, Molesley?

48:51.807 --> 48:53.482
Yes, your ladyship.

48:53.522 --> 48:54.997
Oh.

48:55.038 --> 48:58.069
What are you doing
in London, Edith dear?

48:58.109 --> 49:00.741
Oh you know, seeing people.

49:00.781 --> 49:03.612
There's no need to shout!
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

49:03.653 --> 49:06.125
It looked to me as if you were
about to drop it.

49:06.165 --> 49:08.278
Well, I wasn't.
Very well.

49:08.319 --> 49:10.791
Here, take this.

49:13.424 --> 49:15.099
Molesley?

49:15.139 --> 49:16.614
I'm sorry, m'lady.

49:16.654 --> 49:18.887
I didn't realise
the plate was so hot.

49:20.124 --> 49:22.955
Poor man. He seems quite new
to this kind of work.

49:22.996 --> 49:24.391
Does he?

49:24.432 --> 49:28.181
Oh, but that is, no dear no,
that is Molesley's strength.

49:28.221 --> 49:31.411
You see he is always
ready for a challenge.

49:31.451 --> 49:34.123
I think it was very kind of you
to allow him to have a go at it.

49:35.479 --> 49:37.951
Yes well, we, we try to do our best.

49:37.992 --> 49:40.544
I do find it very hard these days
to see how many men

49:40.584 --> 49:44.213
are forced to take employment
for which they are quite unsuited.

49:44.254 --> 49:48.769
I hope you'll soon get back to
whatever it is you're trained for.

50:19.139 --> 50:22.935
Come in, Mr Grigg.
Mrs Hughes has told me all about you.

50:22.975 --> 50:25.292
Thank you, Mrs Crawley.

50:25.333 --> 50:26.731
Oh.

50:28.370 --> 50:32.485
I was er... I was wondering
if Charlie might be here.

50:32.526 --> 50:36.122
Charlie Carson.
No. Mr Carson's very busy.

50:36.162 --> 50:39.079
But, I'll tell him
that you've arrived safely.

50:39.119 --> 50:40.957
But, he does know I'm coming here?

50:40.997 --> 50:42.955
We talked of it yesterday.

50:42.995 --> 50:44.753
Now, I've run a bath

50:44.794 --> 50:47.631
and dug out some clean clothes
from the missionary barrel.

50:47.671 --> 50:50.628
They should fit you, at least until
we can find something better.

50:50.668 --> 50:54.584
You're very kind.
Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

50:59.379 --> 51:02.695
While I'm sorting him out, I wondered
if you'd look in at the kitchen

51:02.736 --> 51:06.172
and tell Mrs Field he's arrived
and to put his luncheon on a tray.

51:06.213 --> 51:10.174
I think he should stay in bed today
and then we can see where we are.

51:10.220 --> 51:12.806
He's right. You're very kind.

51:12.841 --> 51:15.764
No, no. We must all do what we can.

51:44.062 --> 51:45.852
Hello.

51:45.891 --> 51:48.516
You look... very glamorous.

51:48.557 --> 51:50.983
I thought I'd make
a bit of an effort.

51:51.023 --> 51:53.051
I'm glad you did.

51:53.092 --> 51:55.240
I've ordered some wine for us.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.905
Heavens, how spoiling.

52:01.287 --> 52:03.475
I love the Criterion.

52:08.249 --> 52:10.357
It feels so wild.

52:10.397 --> 52:15.051
To be out with a man, drinking and
dining in a smart London restaurant.

52:15.092 --> 52:18.149
Can you imagine being allowed
to do anything of the sort

52:18.190 --> 52:20.007
five years ago, never mind ten?

52:20.049 --> 52:22.280
The war changed everything.

52:22.322 --> 52:25.337
Mama used to say we could
never eat anywhere public,

52:25.379 --> 52:27.610
except an hotel we were staying in.

52:27.651 --> 52:30.584
She might cheat and take us to
the Ritz, but that was about it.

52:32.403 --> 52:33.975
I do love you so.

52:34.014 --> 52:36.008
Do you?
Hmm.

52:36.399 --> 52:38.163
I'm glad.

52:39.314 --> 52:43.341
Is that what we're celebrating?
That, and my progress.

52:45.605 --> 52:49.325
I've found out I can
divorce Lizzie in Germany,

52:49.365 --> 52:51.935
if I become a German citizen.

52:54.303 --> 52:58.431
You're willing to become
a German citizen, for me?

52:58.703 --> 53:00.186
You'd do that?

53:00.226 --> 53:02.711
I'd become an Eskimo
if it meant I could marry you.

53:02.751 --> 53:05.276
But... Germany?

53:06.679 --> 53:08.482
After four years of fighting,

53:08.523 --> 53:11.489
you'd join the most hated race
in Europe for me?

53:19.145 --> 53:20.564
Can I kiss you?

53:20.602 --> 53:22.290
What, here?

53:23.288 --> 53:26.510
In front of all these people?
I don't care.

53:27.624 --> 53:30.603
Kiss me. Now.

53:39.834 --> 53:41.988
Edna Braithwaite is coming back?

53:42.028 --> 53:45.100
I would have talked it over
with you first but...

53:45.141 --> 53:47.535
When I saw that wonderful
reference you wrote her.

53:47.575 --> 53:49.650
Yes, but that was because...

53:51.007 --> 53:55.875
I wrote her a good reference because
I thought she was a good worker,

53:55.916 --> 53:58.869
but I don't see her as a lady's maid.

54:00.625 --> 54:03.697
Couldn't you wait for the replies
to the advertisement, m'lady,

54:03.738 --> 54:05.733
before coming to a decision?

54:07.250 --> 54:09.843
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

54:12.917 --> 54:16.397
Do you want to prevent my giving a
hard-working woman a helping hand?

54:25.039 --> 54:28.879
You know, it WAS Jimmy
sent that card to Ivy.

54:29.840 --> 54:31.360
You don't know that.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.040
I think I do.

54:33.081 --> 54:37.441
But, if it were him,
then Alfie must have sent mine.

54:41.002 --> 54:42.442
Alfred. Come with me.

54:42.483 --> 54:45.123
Why?
Never you mind. Just come along.

54:48.684 --> 54:52.724
Mr Molesley? Can I get you anything?

54:52.765 --> 54:55.085
A cup of tea?
No. I don't want to be a bother.

54:55.125 --> 54:58.765
How was the famous luncheon?
Lady Edith told me all about it.

54:58.806 --> 55:02.006
Was that before or after?

55:02.047 --> 55:03.047
Before.

55:03.087 --> 55:05.647
Right. Let's just leave it at that,
shall we?

55:08.048 --> 55:09.808
Mrs Hughes was looking for me.

55:09.848 --> 55:12.528
I saw her go into her sitting room.
Shall I fetch her?

55:12.569 --> 55:13.649
No need.

55:13.689 --> 55:15.689
I'm sorry not to have mentioned it.

55:15.729 --> 55:17.969
I sent the card to Ivy.

55:18.850 --> 55:21.170
But... Jimmy said...

55:21.210 --> 55:22.410
He didn't send one.

55:22.451 --> 55:25.651
Or, if he did,
it wasn't to anyone at Downton.

55:28.332 --> 55:30.452
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

55:38.174 --> 55:40.614
If it weren't him,
then who did send my card?

55:42.295 --> 55:43.935
I won't sleep now.

55:43.975 --> 55:46.495
Oh, for heaven's sake! I sent it.

55:47.456 --> 55:49.416
You?!
Yes.

55:51.057 --> 55:54.657
I thought Alfred
would buy one for Ivy,

55:54.697 --> 55:57.777
and I didn't want you to
have nothing to open if he did.

55:59.418 --> 56:01.258
I'm sorry if I did wrong.

56:01.299 --> 56:03.699
No, don't be sorry.

56:03.739 --> 56:07.059
I may not have a follower,
but at least I've got a friend.

56:09.140 --> 56:11.500
Goodnight, Mrs Patmore.

56:16.982 --> 56:20.902
I didn't know what else to say.
I had written her a good reference.

56:20.943 --> 56:22.543
Only because I asked you to.

56:22.583 --> 56:26.823
And was I to tell her that,
Mr Branson, and why you asked me?

56:26.864 --> 56:28.704
It's up to me to tell her.

56:28.744 --> 56:30.624
I'm the one who got us
into this fix.

56:30.665 --> 56:32.265
No.

56:32.305 --> 56:35.145
Her ladyship has lost a daughter
and a son-in-law.

56:35.186 --> 56:39.626
I cannot now let her think that
Lady Sybil's husband was unworthy.

56:39.667 --> 56:41.747
It's too much.

56:42.987 --> 56:45.067
Then what are we to do?

56:45.108 --> 56:46.908
We can't have her here.
We must.

56:46.948 --> 56:50.788
We'll let her come back and we'll
make sure that she behaves herself.

56:50.829 --> 56:52.589
And if she doesn't?

56:52.629 --> 56:54.949
We must keep a firm eye on her,

56:54.990 --> 56:59.030
and I hope we may rely on you to see
that Edna doesn't step out of line.

56:59.071 --> 57:00.751
Of course.

57:00.791 --> 57:04.511
After all, she does appear to have
acquired some proper training.

57:04.552 --> 57:06.552
I don't think that's a lie.

57:06.592 --> 57:09.072
Maybe she's moved
into the real world.

57:11.953 --> 57:14.973
Well, it all sounds like
a ticking bomb to me.

57:30.176 --> 57:33.936
There, there, my precious boy,

57:33.977 --> 57:39.658
and don't let that chauffeur's
daughter disturb you any more.

57:43.059 --> 57:44.939
Go back to sleep,

57:44.979 --> 57:48.459
you wicked little cross-breed.

57:51.660 --> 57:54.980
Your ladyship...
I didn't see you there.

57:55.021 --> 57:56.381
Obviously not.

57:56.421 --> 57:58.141
I was just er...

57:58.182 --> 58:00.802
I was just having a game
with Miss Sybbie.

58:00.810 --> 58:04.290
I want you to pack tonight and
leave first thing in the morning.

58:04.331 --> 58:05.771
But, your ladyship...

58:05.811 --> 58:08.411
Please put Master George
back into his crib.

58:08.452 --> 58:11.052
You are not to touch
the children again.

58:12.133 --> 58:14.973
Oh. I thought it was
Nanny West ringing.

58:15.013 --> 58:18.133
No, Mrs Hughes, Nanny West
is leaving in the morning.

58:18.174 --> 58:20.294
Can you find her a bed for the night

58:20.334 --> 58:23.014
and ask one of the maids
to sleep with the children?

58:23.055 --> 58:26.175
But, your ladyship,
I was only joking.

58:26.215 --> 58:27.815
I prefer not to discuss it,

58:27.856 --> 58:31.376
except to say that your values
have no place in a civilised home!

58:32.537 --> 58:34.137
Now, Mrs Hughes...

58:35.857 --> 58:38.177
I'll wait here
while Nanny West packs.

58:39.658 --> 58:42.258
You will fetch a maid
and prepare a room.

58:42.299 --> 58:45.899
You understand, Miss West is not to
be left alone with the children.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.139
Not for one minute.

58:49.140 --> 58:52.620
I wonder how Edith's getting on.
She has quite a London life.

58:52.661 --> 58:55.941
She's seeing that publisher.
Is it serious?

58:56.862 --> 59:00.902
Well, he's not bad looking
and he's still alive,

59:00.943 --> 59:04.503
which puts him two points ahead
of most men of our generation.

59:05.583 --> 59:08.543
Which doesn't alter the fact
she could do a great deal better.

59:08.584 --> 59:11.744
Do you know anything about him?
Not really.

59:12.785 --> 59:15.265
He talked to Matthew a bit
when we were at Duneagle...

59:22.027 --> 59:23.667
Go to bed.

59:23.707 --> 59:26.027
You look done in.

59:33.069 --> 59:35.789
Do you want me at the tenants'
luncheon tomorrow?

59:35.830 --> 59:37.950
No, there's no reason for you to be.

59:37.990 --> 59:41.510
I know you're trying to shield me...
Let me manage things in my own way.

59:41.551 --> 59:43.911
Please. It'll be for the best.

59:45.992 --> 59:49.632
I have ideas, you know.
Matthew and I used to talk...

59:49.673 --> 59:52.433
My dear, I know I'm right in this.

59:53.793 --> 59:55.593
Now, go to bed.

01:00:19.399 --> 01:00:20.839
My lady?

01:00:20.879 --> 01:00:23.599
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

01:00:23.639 --> 01:00:26.199
but I think you know why I've come.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.920
To apologise.
You have nothing to apologise for.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.801
I pushed into your room
and I spoke impertinently.

01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:36.682
I suppose you know my grandmother
agrees with you.

01:00:36.722 --> 01:00:38.922
That doesn't surprise me.

01:00:40.483 --> 01:00:44.523
So, does this mean you've decided to
return to the land of the living?

01:00:46.244 --> 01:00:49.524
Because, if so, I'm glad.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:55.806
It means that I know that I've spent
too long in the land of the dead.

01:00:57.006 --> 01:01:00.166
We were very fond of Mr Crawley,
you know, my lady.

01:01:00.207 --> 01:01:02.127
All of us.

01:01:06.048 --> 01:01:07.528
I...

01:01:25.092 --> 01:01:27.452
You cry, m'lady.

01:01:28.453 --> 01:01:31.493
You have a good cry.

01:01:31.533 --> 01:01:34.293
That's what's needed now.

01:01:36.774 --> 01:01:38.494
And when you're ready...

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:42.055
..you can get to work.

01:01:42.096 --> 01:01:44.816
Because you are strong enough.

01:01:50.537 --> 01:01:53.297
You're strong enough for the task.

01:01:53.338 --> 01:01:55.738
But am I, Carson?

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.858
That's the point.
Papa doesn't seem to think so.

01:01:58.899 --> 01:02:03.339
Don't you owe it to Mr Crawley,
to protect his work?

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.820
To fight for the changes he made?

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.900
To steer Downton
in the right direction?

01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:10.901
I know I can always count on you

01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.141
for a draught of self-confidence
whenever I start to doubt.

01:02:14.182 --> 01:02:17.262
And you will always find one here.

01:02:20.944 --> 01:02:22.684
Good night, Carson.

01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:26.661
Good night, m'lady.

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:40.293
Oh my gosh.

01:02:43.816 --> 01:02:46.923
Ohh...
What in God's name...?

01:02:46.966 --> 01:02:49.876
I must have put those
ruddy prongs in wrong.

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:52.558
You did something wrong.

01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:54.752
What a day this has
turned out to be.

01:02:54.783 --> 01:02:56.111
Why?

01:02:56.148 --> 01:02:58.140
Nanny West has been sacked.

01:02:58.177 --> 01:03:00.022
So, that's fun for tomorrow.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.236
Well, I'll get the sack
if anyone sees this!

01:03:03.276 --> 01:03:06.090
Let Daisy and Ivy clean it up
in the morning.

01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:08.945
But Daisy mustn't find out
I don't know how to work it.

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.110
Why ever not?

01:03:10.152 --> 01:03:11.664
Because it makes her
part of the future

01:03:11.697 --> 01:03:14.469
and leaves me stuck in the past,
don't you see?

01:03:17.606 --> 01:03:21.358
Oh... Fetch me an apron.
We'll do it together.

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:24.161
Would you, really?
Why not?

01:03:24.202 --> 01:03:26.038
Who needs sleep?

01:03:26.717 --> 01:03:28.034
Thank you.

01:03:34.301 --> 01:03:37.494
I was never sure I liked her.
Nanny West?

01:03:37.535 --> 01:03:39.690
It's not for me to have an opinion,

01:03:39.731 --> 01:03:41.886
but I will say this...

01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:02.166
Where did you get to last night?

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:06.397
I was fast asleep before you came in
and you were sleeping when I left.

01:04:06.438 --> 01:04:08.114
I'm afraid it was very late.

01:04:08.154 --> 01:04:11.028
But I'm glad you're here now
because I want you to know

01:04:11.068 --> 01:04:15.339
that we owe a great debt
to Barrow, here.

01:04:17.056 --> 01:04:20.010
It turns out Miss West is quite
unsuited to the role of Nanny.

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:22.405
She is leaving today.
What? Not another one.

01:04:22.446 --> 01:04:25.080
Trust me. We'll talk later.
I must run or I'll be late.

01:04:26.597 --> 01:04:30.149
Barrow, I meant what I said.
Thank you.

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.265
I'm glad, your ladyship.

01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:36.657
I just had a hunch that she
wasn't quite all Sir Garnet.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:54.023
I've no problem,
as long as you test them first.

01:04:59.891 --> 01:05:01.487
I'm so sorry to miss your arrival.

01:05:01.528 --> 01:05:03.803
That's all right, m'lady.
We've not begun to eat.

01:05:03.843 --> 01:05:06.916
Come and sit here.
I'll manage very well at the end.

01:05:06.957 --> 01:05:08.434
Carson can find me a chair.

01:05:09.233 --> 01:05:11.987
No. Sit here. I'll go to the end.

01:05:14.662 --> 01:05:16.418
This is your place.

01:05:17.297 --> 01:05:20.410
Are you sure you have time for this?
Quite sure.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:21.887
I've been looking forward to it.

01:05:22.925 --> 01:05:26.717
Now, Mr Taylor. What's all this
I hear about your giving up sheep?

01:05:26.758 --> 01:05:30.031
Well, m'lady, it's not
quite as simple as that.

01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:33.863
If truth be told,
I'd rather be farming livestock...

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:36.777
And why is that?
