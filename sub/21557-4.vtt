00:00.090 --> 00:03.305
What's up, Internet fam?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:03.306 --> 00:05.240
I spent 16 years of my life

00:05.241 --> 00:07.375
learning how to speak Married Woman.

00:07.376 --> 00:11.413
But when I got divorced,
I had to relearn Single Lady.

00:11.414 --> 00:15.984
For example, when a girl goes
"Hi, it's nice to meet you,"

00:15.985 --> 00:17.485
what she really is saying is,

00:17.486 --> 00:20.655
"So uh, where is this
relationship going?"

00:20.656 --> 00:22.390
And when a girl says,

00:22.391 --> 00:24.726
"Um, do you mind if I leave this
little toothbrush here?"

00:24.727 --> 00:26.428
What she's really saying is,

00:26.429 --> 00:28.396
"Um, so, when
are we turning this office

00:28.397 --> 00:29.731
into a baby nursery?"

00:29.732 --> 00:32.601
And when a girl says,
"No, I'm perfectly cool

00:32.601 --> 00:34.769
having sex with no
emotional attachment,"

00:34.770 --> 00:36.638
what she really means is...

00:38.574 --> 00:41.409
Marlon, why haven't you called me?

00:41.410 --> 00:43.578
That's what they really mean.

00:43.579 --> 00:45.580
I hear you crawling!

00:50.987 --> 00:56.223
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

00:59.528 --> 01:02.597
Okay, okay, okay, what did I miss?

01:02.598 --> 01:05.333
Okay, you're going to have to drink.

01:05.334 --> 01:08.702
The card said "Never have I
ever had sex in a church."

01:12.275 --> 01:15.710
Well, they say to lay
your all on the altar, so...

01:15.711 --> 01:20.482
I knew I heard her voice
coming from the pastor's pulpit.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.784
Talking about, "Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!"

01:22.785 --> 01:26.454
I thought she was
catching the Holy Ghost.

01:26.455 --> 01:28.622
She caught it.

01:30.359 --> 01:32.627
All right, "Never have I ever

01:32.628 --> 01:36.298
used my sexuality to get out
of a traffic ticket."

01:36.299 --> 01:38.066
Okay.

01:38.067 --> 01:40.502
Oh, okay.

01:40.503 --> 01:43.471
Stevie, you're only supposed to drink

01:43.472 --> 01:45.073
if you've done what's on the card.

01:45.074 --> 01:47.809
The officer thought I was very sexy.

01:47.810 --> 01:49.511
Nice guy, he liked my beard.

01:49.512 --> 01:51.813
He let me off with a warning.

01:51.814 --> 01:53.648
Your beard's sexy?

01:53.649 --> 01:58.353
It must be all
of the jojoba oil you use.

01:58.354 --> 01:59.821
- Okay.
- All right.

01:59.822 --> 02:03.391
"Never have I ever killed a man."

02:03.392 --> 02:05.694
Who writes these? These are so dumb.

02:05.695 --> 02:07.862
They need to come up with
a ghetto version of this game.

02:07.863 --> 02:11.066
"Never have I ever named my children

02:11.067 --> 02:15.537
after expensive stuff I can't afford."

02:15.538 --> 02:17.105
"Come here, Cartier.

02:17.106 --> 02:19.107
"Get over here, Cartier.

02:19.108 --> 02:23.611
"Now where is your brother,
Yeezy Boost?

02:23.612 --> 02:25.513
Get over here, Rent."

02:25.514 --> 02:28.683
Stop it.

02:28.684 --> 02:31.353
I mean, who kills somebody?

02:31.354 --> 02:33.720
I don't know.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.459
I was a young candy-striper,

02:37.460 --> 02:40.628
and he was an old guy on life support.

02:40.629 --> 02:43.597
I needed to charge my phone.

02:44.834 --> 02:47.801
What? They brought him back.

02:50.473 --> 02:52.140
You know, I need to get a life.

02:52.141 --> 02:53.742
I'm going to die of thirst

02:53.743 --> 02:56.144
before something I've done
comes up on these cards.

02:56.145 --> 02:57.812
My turn.

02:57.813 --> 03:02.917
Oh, "Never have I ever
had sex with an ex."

03:02.918 --> 03:04.552
Cheers.

03:04.553 --> 03:07.588
Hmm?

03:09.392 --> 03:12.427
Um, drink, bitch.

03:12.428 --> 03:14.596
I've never slept with an ex.

03:14.597 --> 03:16.364
Uh, hold up.

03:16.365 --> 03:20.535
You mean, since the divorce,
you and Marlon-never?

03:20.536 --> 03:23.605
Never have we ever.

03:23.606 --> 03:25.140
Well, I assumed the only reason

03:25.141 --> 03:26.908
you let Big Head hang around here

03:26.909 --> 03:30.812
was because he was breaking
you off every now and then.

03:30.813 --> 03:33.481
Yvette, we are divorced.

03:33.482 --> 03:34.582
So?

03:34.583 --> 03:36.751
I read an article on BuzzFeed

03:36.752 --> 03:38.787
that said something like

03:38.788 --> 03:41.923
38% of divorced couples have
occasional sex,

03:41.924 --> 03:44.192
and it's perfectly healthy.

03:44.193 --> 03:47.528
And they keep your numbers low.

03:48.697 --> 03:52.500
Yvette, if we wanted
to have occasional sex,

03:52.501 --> 03:55.637
we would have stayed married.

03:55.638 --> 03:58.173
Hello.

04:00.443 --> 04:02.977
So what'd you think
about what Yvette said?

04:02.978 --> 04:05.447
Yeah, I know, that was crazy, right?

04:05.448 --> 04:08.650
I mean, I always knew there was
something off about that girl,

04:08.651 --> 04:12.454
but I didn't know she was a killer.

04:12.455 --> 04:14.656
You better watch your back.
She got the taste, you know?

04:14.657 --> 04:16.690
They don't just stop at one.

04:16.692 --> 04:18.959
Maybe she got a thing for
killing light-skinned girls.

04:18.961 --> 04:22.464
She might be like
the light-skinned strangler.

04:22.465 --> 04:25.900
The mulatto mangler. Watch out.

04:25.901 --> 04:29.504
Marlon, I'm talking about the article.

04:29.505 --> 04:31.473
You know, ex sex?

04:31.474 --> 04:35.743
Oh, I mean, 38% of divorced
couples hooking up, whatever.

04:35.744 --> 04:37.512
It must be nice.

04:37.513 --> 04:38.913
It's been a pretty long time for me.

04:38.914 --> 04:42.250
You mean, you ain't got
no "break glass?"

04:42.251 --> 04:44.486
Marlon, you know that I'm not

04:44.487 --> 04:46.688
a "hit it and quit it" kind of girl.

04:46.689 --> 04:47.755
I'm the opposite.

04:47.756 --> 04:50.525
I be like, "Slam, bam."

04:50.526 --> 04:54.562
She be like, "Damn."

04:54.563 --> 04:56.030
I be like, "Thank you, ma'am."

04:56.031 --> 04:58.666
And she be like,
"So when do I move in?"

04:58.667 --> 05:00.969
And I be like, "Chill."

05:00.970 --> 05:03.771
And she be like,
"So it's gonna be one night?"

05:03.772 --> 05:07.709
And I be like,
"Why'd I hit this crazy girl?"

05:07.710 --> 05:10.578
And she be like,
"Oh, I know where you live."

05:10.579 --> 05:14.048
And I be like, "Damn, Stevie,
we gotta change the locks."

05:14.049 --> 05:17.485
Yeah, so it's been a while for me too.

05:17.486 --> 05:18.686
No way.

05:18.687 --> 05:20.588
I'm serious, I had to take a break.

05:20.589 --> 05:23.591
You know, the locksmith was at
my house at least once a week?

05:23.592 --> 05:25.093
You had to change your locks that much?

05:25.094 --> 05:28.763
I was dating a locksmith.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.798
The girl kept letting herself in.

05:30.799 --> 05:33.268
Okay, so what about us?

05:33.269 --> 05:36.704
Do you think we could, um,
be 38-percenters?

05:36.705 --> 05:38.039
Are you drunk?

05:38.040 --> 05:41.609
No, I only had one drink
the whole damn game,

05:41.610 --> 05:43.711
and that was for something you did.

05:43.712 --> 05:46.047
Seriously, Marlon,
I want to live a little.

05:46.048 --> 05:47.815
Take a walk on the wild side.

05:47.816 --> 05:49.317
So why can't we do this?

05:49.318 --> 05:50.919
Because you're Ashley.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.820
This is not the way you're wired.

05:52.821 --> 05:55.623
I mean, you're going to get
all caught up in your feelings.

05:55.624 --> 05:58.826
Pssh. Not with you.

05:58.827 --> 06:01.896
Marlon, I was already
married to you, okay?

06:01.897 --> 06:03.765
And I never want to do that again.

06:03.766 --> 06:06.067
Sex was the one part
of our relationship

06:06.068 --> 06:07.068
that kind of worked.

06:07.069 --> 06:08.903
Yeah.

06:08.904 --> 06:12.340
I did tear it up.

06:12.341 --> 06:15.777
Oh, boy.

06:15.778 --> 06:18.580
Oh, I'd make your little toes do this.

06:18.581 --> 06:21.082
They'd be like.

06:21.083 --> 06:24.152
They twinkle, twinkle little star.

06:24.153 --> 06:26.621
And then they'd curl up,
and you looked like you was

06:26.622 --> 06:28.690
throwing up gang signs with your feet.

06:28.691 --> 06:30.091
Let's just do this, okay?

06:30.092 --> 06:33.628
No feelings, no romance,
just down and dirty.

06:33.629 --> 06:35.029
I won't even shave my legs.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.495
You really think you could do this?

06:36.496 --> 06:37.632
Oh, I know I could.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.100
I know I could.

06:39.101 --> 06:40.068
Okay.

06:40.069 --> 06:41.502
Okay.

06:41.503 --> 06:43.004
Let's do it.

06:43.005 --> 06:44.806
So this Friday night,

06:44.807 --> 06:47.141
I'll ask Yvette to take
the kids for a sleepover,

06:47.142 --> 06:51.112
and you and I will join the 38% club.

06:51.113 --> 06:52.180
Cool.

06:52.181 --> 06:53.881
Let's do it.

06:53.882 --> 06:55.950
We'll knock it out
like a couple of strangers,

06:55.951 --> 06:57.291
and then I'll call you an Uber.

07:00.055 --> 07:02.056
Is that what you do for your jump-offs?

07:02.057 --> 07:05.960
Hey, hey, hey, "jump-offs"
is a derogatory term.

07:05.961 --> 07:07.862
Mm-hmm, uh-uh.

07:07.863 --> 07:10.131
Okay, they prefer "side pieces."

07:10.132 --> 07:11.799
Oh, okay.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.867
Yes, or "thots."

07:12.868 --> 07:15.737
Okay.

07:15.738 --> 07:17.972
And then I call them all an Uber.

07:17.973 --> 07:19.040
UberX?

07:19.041 --> 07:21.743
UberPOOL.

07:21.744 --> 07:23.011
And they still want to move in?

07:23.012 --> 07:26.914
Girl, I'm Uber-special.

07:26.915 --> 07:30.018
You better get your stretch on.

07:30.019 --> 07:32.220
I got this one move
I call "The Superman."

07:32.221 --> 07:34.921
I just hop up. Oh!

07:38.661 --> 07:40.161
It's crazy.

07:40.162 --> 07:42.697
Then I got this one called
"The Roasted Pig."

07:42.698 --> 07:45.098
I put an apple in your mouth.

07:52.975 --> 07:55.075
You won't know.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:04.084 --> 08:05.451
Hey.

08:06.354 --> 08:08.072
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

08:08.073 --> 08:09.774
You know, something like this

08:09.775 --> 08:11.776
could really put a strain
on a relationship.

08:11.777 --> 08:13.911
You think Marlon and I
are making a mistake?

08:13.912 --> 08:16.814
No, I'm talking about me
watching your kids.

08:16.815 --> 08:19.584
You know kids do not fit
into my life plan.

08:19.585 --> 08:22.086
Everything is so white
and breakable in here!

08:22.087 --> 08:23.654
You're damn right it is.

08:23.655 --> 08:26.090
Put your hands in your pockets.

08:26.091 --> 08:28.793
Jesus, boo, please give me the strength

08:28.794 --> 08:32.697
to not dropkick these... babies.

08:32.698 --> 08:35.099
Yvette, I know this isn't your scene,

08:35.100 --> 08:38.001
and I really appreciate this.

08:38.003 --> 08:39.937
I'm kind of excited about tonight.

08:39.938 --> 08:41.938
I mean, as impossible as he is,

08:41.940 --> 08:43.707
Marlon does know
his way around the bedroom.

08:43.708 --> 08:45.141
Eww!

08:47.579 --> 08:50.681
Girl, are you sure
you're not going to get hurt

08:50.682 --> 08:51.949
fooling around with Marlon?

08:51.950 --> 08:53.918
You do get attached pretty quickly.

08:53.919 --> 08:55.820
When that barista
put a heart on your cup,

08:55.821 --> 09:00.391
you sent his nephew to Space Camp.

09:00.392 --> 09:02.960
I chipped in.

09:02.961 --> 09:06.197
All right, I do tend
to get emotionally invested.

09:06.198 --> 09:08.399
But this is Marlon we're talking about,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.801
so I think I can remain
emotionally detached.

09:10.802 --> 09:13.404
Ahh! Zach, put that down!

09:13.405 --> 09:17.842
But it's a ball.
I got to know if it bounces.

09:17.843 --> 09:20.912
Girl, you better get out of
here before I change my mind.

09:20.913 --> 09:22.813
Okay, kids, listen to Aunt Yvette.

09:22.814 --> 09:23.981
Thank you so much. I love you.

09:23.982 --> 09:24.982
Love you.

09:27.686 --> 09:31.022
Marlon, trust me, you're
making a life-altering mistake.

09:31.023 --> 09:33.224
You know, you got a
lot of relationship advice

09:33.225 --> 09:36.060
for a guy who got
a "sorry, we're stumped" email

09:36.061 --> 09:39.030
from Match.com.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.731
You and Ashley have
a great thing going.

09:40.732 --> 09:42.033
You see your family whenever you want,

09:42.034 --> 09:43.868
and you still get to date.

09:43.869 --> 09:46.938
If you go through this, you
will destroy a perfect divorce.

09:46.939 --> 09:50.374
I'm just going to make
a perfect divorce perfecter.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.777
That's what you think,
but it's different for women.

09:52.778 --> 09:55.246
Once you make love,
she'll fall right back in,

09:55.247 --> 09:59.183
and life as you know it is donesville.

09:59.184 --> 10:03.721
You never say "donesville" again.

10:03.722 --> 10:06.724
It is disrespectful to black people.

10:06.725 --> 10:09.126
Barack Obama did not do
eight years in office,

10:09.127 --> 10:13.030
getting hated on by Republicans

10:13.031 --> 10:17.134
for your ass to say "donesville."

10:17.135 --> 10:18.769
It wasn't like he finished office like,

10:18.770 --> 10:21.104
"I'm donesville." No!

10:25.177 --> 10:27.911
Barack said, "I'm out, bitch."

10:31.850 --> 10:33.884
I know what I'm talking about, Marlon.

10:33.885 --> 10:35.753
And I'm telling you this,

10:35.754 --> 10:38.122
women can't do it without
getting emotionally attached.

10:38.123 --> 10:40.891
If you're not going to think
of yourself, think of me.

10:40.892 --> 10:43.060
The hot girls you date
almost always have

10:43.061 --> 10:47.798
a less-attractive friend
who needs to be occupied by me.

10:47.799 --> 10:52.270
If I lose that,
my love life is donesville.

10:52.271 --> 10:56.073
You gonna make me violent.

10:56.074 --> 10:57.842
You stop with "donesville."

10:57.843 --> 11:03.080
Rosa Parks did not sit in
the front of the bus and say,

11:03.081 --> 11:05.149
"Uh-uh, I ain't moving nowhere,"

11:05.150 --> 11:08.085
for you to say "donesville."

11:08.086 --> 11:10.221
Listen, Stevie, I know women, okay?

11:10.222 --> 11:13.124
Me and Ashley agreed, this is
not going to be all romantic.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.925
We're not making love.

11:14.926 --> 11:16.527
This is going to be hit it and quit it.

11:16.528 --> 11:18.829
Smash it and dash it.

11:18.830 --> 11:21.232
Beat it and street it.

11:21.233 --> 11:24.000
Sex it and exit.

11:26.805 --> 11:29.205
Lube her, then Uber.

11:35.714 --> 11:39.015
And you have a problem
with "donesville."

11:42.054 --> 11:43.854
You've got to trust me on this, Stevie.

11:43.855 --> 11:47.123
Listen, she's not even
going to shave her legs.

11:48.694 --> 11:51.227
Hi, Marlon.

11:52.964 --> 11:55.366
Oh, wow.

11:55.367 --> 11:58.169
You shaved your legs.

11:58.170 --> 12:00.403
That's not all I shaved.

12:02.107 --> 12:04.075
Stevie, you was right.

12:04.076 --> 12:05.843
This isn't hit it and quit it.

12:05.844 --> 12:08.044
It's tap it and trap it.

12:09.037 --> 12:10.905
Okay, okay, where are you?

12:10.906 --> 12:12.040
I'm in the bathroom.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.708
I told her I had to freshen up.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.877
Hold up, let me splash
some water around,

12:15.878 --> 12:19.179
so this way she thinks
I'm washing my privates.

12:19.982 --> 12:23.684
Listen, man, this isn't the
uncomplicated down and dirty

12:23.685 --> 12:25.052
that she promised me.

12:25.053 --> 12:26.821
If I leave, I hurt her.

12:26.822 --> 12:29.724
If I stay, she winds up
falling back in love,

12:29.725 --> 12:31.559
and then I have to break her heart.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.328
- You got to get out of there.
- Oh.

12:34.329 --> 12:37.064
Either way it goes, I messed
up the perfect divorce.

12:37.065 --> 12:38.766
Why didn't you warn me, Stevie?

12:38.767 --> 12:41.068
I did. I used those exact words.

12:42.571 --> 12:44.906
Hurry up, Tiger.

12:44.907 --> 12:47.842
Did you hear that?
She just called me Tiger.

12:47.843 --> 12:50.611
She's throwing '70s sexy at me.

12:50.612 --> 12:55.583
She knows how much I
dig that jive, baby.

12:55.584 --> 12:58.019
Marlon, who are you talking to?

12:58.020 --> 12:59.954
Uh...

12:59.955 --> 13:01.822
No one, Mama.

13:01.823 --> 13:05.793
I'm just in here picking out
my nappy chest hairs,

13:05.794 --> 13:08.396
throwing on a little Aqua Velva,

13:08.397 --> 13:12.366
and I'ma come in there and lay
the skinny down on that thing.

13:12.367 --> 13:15.069
Aww, sookie, sookie.

13:15.070 --> 13:18.105
And I should not be hearing this.

13:18.106 --> 13:19.907
There's no sauce on this pizza.

13:19.908 --> 13:21.609
That's because I've seen what you do

13:21.610 --> 13:23.144
with sauce at your mama's house.

13:23.145 --> 13:24.779
Can I have some grape juice?

13:24.780 --> 13:26.881
Oh.

13:26.882 --> 13:31.786
You can have some water juice.

13:31.787 --> 13:35.389
I'm the only one allowed to
drink grapes up in here, okay?

13:35.390 --> 13:38.125
Haven't you ever watched kids before?

13:38.126 --> 13:39.827
Yes.

13:39.828 --> 13:42.897
I've watched them ruin people's lives.

13:42.898 --> 13:44.432
So you never want to have a baby?

13:44.433 --> 13:46.767
Babies make your boobies droop.

13:46.768 --> 13:51.239
They jack your uterus, and they
stretch your...

13:51.240 --> 13:53.841
finances.

13:53.842 --> 13:57.144
I like my life way too much
to waste it on kids.

13:57.145 --> 13:59.098
Well, who's going to take care
of you when you're old?

13:59.099 --> 14:00.948
Say what now?

14:00.949 --> 14:02.950
My parents always have
me and Zach, and someday

14:02.951 --> 14:05.119
they'll have grandkids and
people to look after them.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.188
Who will you have?

14:07.189 --> 14:10.157
I wouldn't want to be old
and alone in this place.

14:10.158 --> 14:13.160
Your bad knee locks up on
that stairway with no railing,

14:13.161 --> 14:14.996
and bam!

14:14.997 --> 14:17.765
They won't find your
corpse for two months.

14:17.766 --> 14:21.035
By then, your cats will have eaten you.

14:21.036 --> 14:22.770
I don't have cats.

14:22.771 --> 14:24.337
You will.

14:34.783 --> 14:36.050
Oh.

14:36.051 --> 14:37.852
Oh, my God.

14:37.853 --> 14:40.955
I have such a headache.

14:40.956 --> 14:42.823
Would you mind turning that music down?

14:42.824 --> 14:45.293
Ugh.

14:45.294 --> 14:47.495
And I feel so bloated.

14:47.496 --> 14:49.697
It must have been
all the food we had today.

14:49.698 --> 14:52.867
Okay, first of all, we didn't eat.

14:52.868 --> 14:56.203
And secondly, you love doing it
on a full stomach.

14:56.204 --> 14:58.039
Don't you remember how we celebrated

14:58.040 --> 15:00.174
you winning the pancake-eating contest?

15:00.175 --> 15:02.009
Oh, yeah.

15:02.010 --> 15:04.278
That's right, we came up
with a new move that day.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.814
The IHOP.

15:06.815 --> 15:09.216
Hop from there all the way over there.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.185
Why don't you, um...

15:11.186 --> 15:13.954
Why don't you come over here?

15:13.955 --> 15:17.058
Uh, no, I think I'll sit right here.

15:17.059 --> 15:19.060
It's much more comfortable.

15:19.061 --> 15:21.195
And I have a nice northeasterly breeze

15:21.196 --> 15:23.230
coming from that vent over there.

15:23.231 --> 15:24.932
It's really refreshing.

15:24.933 --> 15:27.535
Okay, well, I will come to you,

15:27.536 --> 15:29.837
'cause you're nice and clean.

15:29.838 --> 15:32.006
Well, no, no, no, I'm not...
I'm actually not clean.

15:32.007 --> 15:35.976
I didn't get to wash in there.
I just took a ho bath.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.545
I didn't get to really wash

15:37.546 --> 15:39.080
because I don't like your body wash.

15:39.081 --> 15:40.848
I like bar soap.

15:40.849 --> 15:44.018
Yeah, because I get all up
in my nooks and my crannies.

15:44.019 --> 15:46.954
And I'm skinny,
so I got really deep nooks

15:46.955 --> 15:49.023
and really long crannies.

15:49.024 --> 15:51.058
You know, I think I'm going
to go to my house and shower,

15:51.059 --> 15:52.259
and I'll just come right back.

15:52.260 --> 15:55.062
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.531
Ain't nobody got time for that.

15:57.532 --> 16:01.268
Wow, that's the "freak
'em nightie" right there.

16:01.269 --> 16:04.872
Yeah, I know that it was your favorite.

16:04.873 --> 16:06.574
Oh, yeah, it is.

16:06.575 --> 16:08.576
Well, it used to be my favorite,

16:08.577 --> 16:10.244
you know, back when we were married,

16:10.245 --> 16:12.880
and in a committed relationship,
you know, so it's...

16:12.881 --> 16:16.117
So, um, have you seen "This Is Us?"

16:16.118 --> 16:17.985
It's really good.

16:17.986 --> 16:20.554
You know, I'm surprised I
like it as much as I do.

16:20.555 --> 16:21.822
The critics love it.

16:21.823 --> 16:23.224
Shh-shh.

16:23.225 --> 16:26.861
How about a little less talking

16:26.862 --> 16:31.899
and a little bit more
of taking off this towel?

16:31.900 --> 16:33.601
Hey, hey, hey, hey, woman.

16:33.602 --> 16:35.102
What is wrong with you?

16:35.103 --> 16:36.270
Okay?

16:36.271 --> 16:40.408
I'm not just a piece of meat.

16:40.409 --> 16:42.309
How about we have a
little small talk, like,

16:42.310 --> 16:45.079
"Hey, Marlon, how was your day?"

16:45.080 --> 16:47.281
Hey, Marlon, how was your day?

16:47.282 --> 16:48.582
Drop that towel.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.285
Wait!

16:51.286 --> 16:54.622
No means no, Kobe.

16:54.623 --> 16:57.992
Marlon, what is going on?

16:57.993 --> 17:01.162
All right, look, you're
not ready for all of this.

17:01.163 --> 17:02.363
Okay?

17:02.364 --> 17:04.298
You may think you are, but you're not.

17:04.299 --> 17:06.333
I mean, look at you.

17:06.334 --> 17:10.271
You got on my favorite nightie,
you shaved your legs,

17:10.271 --> 17:13.941
you've got Egyptian Musk and Blue Nile,

17:13.942 --> 17:15.608
and frankincense and myrrh burning.

17:15.609 --> 17:19.346
That's the black love
trifecta right there.

17:19.347 --> 17:21.348
And you got that
baby-making music playing.

17:21.348 --> 17:23.217
You want to have animal sex,

17:23.218 --> 17:26.854
put on some southern
rappers that says, "Ahh!"

17:26.855 --> 17:28.388
You make it thug,
but you don't do this.

17:28.390 --> 17:30.124
This is making love.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.892
That's not what this
agreement was about, okay?

17:31.893 --> 17:33.627
You're going to get hurt.

17:40.001 --> 17:41.402
What-what-what...

17:41.403 --> 17:44.205
What's with the villain laugh?

17:44.206 --> 17:48.075
Marlon, I'm not all up
in my feelings, okay?

17:48.076 --> 17:49.677
This is all for me.

17:49.678 --> 17:51.912
I've never hit it and quit it,

17:51.913 --> 17:54.482
and when I have sex,
I like to set a mood.

17:54.483 --> 17:56.183
I'm not going to get hurt.

17:56.184 --> 17:57.418
This is a transaction.

17:57.419 --> 18:00.321
I'm just trying to get her done.

18:00.322 --> 18:03.390
So you're not going to get
all caught up and get hurt?

18:03.391 --> 18:06.227
I divorced you. I'm fine.

18:06.228 --> 18:09.230
So all the history you
and I have together

18:09.231 --> 18:11.098
is not going to come
creeping into your mind

18:11.099 --> 18:12.233
the moment we kiss?

18:12.234 --> 18:14.034
Hell no.

18:14.035 --> 18:19.006
In that case, then let's
get it popping, hot mama.

18:19.007 --> 18:21.909
It's time to get it on.

18:21.910 --> 18:24.444
Aww, sookie sookie now.

18:33.889 --> 18:35.956
I can't do this.

18:35.957 --> 18:37.091
Marlon.

18:37.092 --> 18:39.193
I'm not gonna get hurt.

18:39.194 --> 18:42.363
It's not you I'm worried about.

18:42.364 --> 18:44.131
It's me.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.775
Yeah, I'd like to get an
estimate on installing

18:50.776 --> 18:53.068
some railing on a very
dangerous staircase.

18:53.069 --> 18:55.790
Yeah, call me back. ASAP.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.856
Hey, Aunt Yvette.

19:13.857 --> 19:14.957
Yes?

19:14.958 --> 19:16.959
You don't need to have kids.

19:16.960 --> 19:20.761
When you get old,
I'll take care of you.

19:23.733 --> 19:26.801
You're all right for a kid.

19:27.637 --> 19:31.473
I broke that glass ball.

19:39.649 --> 19:40.816
You know, when I kissed you,

19:40.817 --> 19:43.552
I realized I don't think

19:43.553 --> 19:45.788
I could do this without
getting caught up.

19:45.789 --> 19:49.892
But you've slept with lots
of women since we separated.

19:49.893 --> 19:52.194
Yeah.

19:52.195 --> 19:53.962
A lot.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.998
Like a lot, a lot.

19:55.999 --> 19:59.468
And you didn't feel anything for them.

19:59.469 --> 20:01.602
It's because they're not you.

20:03.606 --> 20:06.508
I'm kind of surprised you
could go through with it.

20:06.509 --> 20:09.511
I know, me too.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.748
I just... I wanted to take
a walk on the wild side,

20:12.749 --> 20:14.683
and I think the only reason I could

20:14.684 --> 20:17.920
is because I feel so
comfortable with you.

20:17.921 --> 20:22.658
So I guess we're not capable
of joining the 38% club.

20:22.659 --> 20:24.759
At least you're not.

20:26.696 --> 20:29.164
Maybe we could cuddle?

20:29.165 --> 20:31.667
- Fine.
- Okay.

20:31.668 --> 20:34.937
But then I'm putting you in an Uber.

20:34.938 --> 20:36.605
UberX?

20:36.606 --> 20:38.607
You didn't put out. UberPOOL.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.442
Wow.

20:40.443 --> 20:42.122
You're going to put your baby daddy

20:42.123 --> 20:44.613
in an UberPOOL with strangers?

20:44.614 --> 20:46.014
Yep.

20:46.015 --> 20:48.417
- Want to spoon?
- Okay.

20:48.418 --> 20:50.618
- I got little spoon.
- All right.
