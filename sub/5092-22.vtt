00:05.406 --> 00:08.276
FRANK: "There is
no place like it,

00:08.309 --> 00:10.511
"no place with an atom
of its glory,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.813
pride, and exultancy."

00:12.846 --> 00:15.383
Walt Whitman.
Mom's favorite.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.617
You remember.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.352
Well, she used to say it

00:18.386 --> 00:20.154
every time
we went over a bridge.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.090
Your mother was
a true New Yorker.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.325
Her first love
was her city.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.394
Well, she may have
loved the city,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.762
but she was
only nuts about you.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.767
Do you really need
to go in on a Saturday

00:33.801 --> 00:35.303
or are you just keeping busy?

00:35.336 --> 00:36.837
I am not just
keeping myself busy.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.639
I am busy.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.208
And it has nothing to do

00:40.241 --> 00:42.110
with tomorrow
being Mother's Day.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.346
It's okay, Dad.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.315
The weekend's
gonna be hard for all of us.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.419
You know, a little
birdie told me

00:51.452 --> 00:52.720
that Linda and your
girlfriends

00:52.753 --> 00:55.223
want to take you
out dancing.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.724
Yeah? What about Nicky?

00:56.757 --> 00:58.826
Do you want me to take
your only granddaughter

00:58.859 --> 01:00.494
to the Boom Boom Room?

01:00.528 --> 01:02.296
I can watch Nicky.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.466
She can help me make
my famous Mother's Day Mash.

01:07.268 --> 01:10.204
Maybe some other time.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.805
Erin, I'm the dad.

01:11.839 --> 01:13.741
It is my job
to worry about you,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.376
not the other way around.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.145
Okay, and who's
gonna worry about you?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.447
What do you think
I have Garrett for?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.149
(chuckles)

01:21.182 --> 01:23.351
RENZULLI:
Next item.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.818
Please give a warm welcome

01:24.852 --> 01:26.387
to a very special guest.

01:26.420 --> 01:29.790
My good friend,
Detective Danny Reagan.

01:29.823 --> 01:32.393
(applause, cheers)

01:33.494 --> 01:35.396
All right, fellas, ladies,

01:35.429 --> 01:38.566
I'm looking for your help
on, uh, case I'm working here.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.234
Whoa. Detective Reagan
needs our help?

01:40.268 --> 01:41.835
What next?
We all getting raises?

01:41.869 --> 01:42.803
(laughs)

01:42.836 --> 01:43.904
That's good.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.439
Especially coming from a guy

01:45.473 --> 01:47.341
who couldn't find a collar
in a shirt factory.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.377
(laughter, jeers)

01:49.410 --> 01:51.645
All right, seriously,
I need your eyes and ears

01:51.679 --> 01:53.881
out there on the street today
looking for this guy.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.449
His name is Leo Packer.
All right?

01:55.483 --> 01:57.451
We like him for a string
of push-in robberies

01:57.485 --> 01:59.787
on the east side.
He's a real charmer this guy.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.190
Targets sweet, old ladies.
Offers to help them

02:02.223 --> 02:04.458
with their bags then helps
with everything they got.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.760
His latest victim is in the
hospital with a broken jaw.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.429
So he's no joke, all right?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.797
See him out there,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.899
scoop him up,
give me a holler.

02:11.932 --> 02:12.866
Thanks.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.435
You got it.
That's a wrap.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.404
Let's go to work.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.938
Hey, kid, take one of those.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.840
I need to talk
to you for a second.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.709
Hand those out, please.
Thank you.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.177
You pick up the roast?

02:23.211 --> 02:24.645
I couldn't;
they changed my tour today.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.946
You said you were
gonna get it.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.781
Actually, you said
I was gonna get it.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.749
I said I would try.
So what?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.951
I got to go pick it up now?
Come on, kid,

02:30.984 --> 02:32.186
I got to work, too.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.421
Well, maybe
Erin can do it.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.555
Erin can't do it.
She's a mother.

02:34.588 --> 02:35.889
We can't send her out
to buy her own

02:35.923 --> 02:37.191
Mother's Day dinner.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.893
Sure you went to Harvard,
numb nuts?

02:43.731 --> 02:45.266
Trouble in Reagan land?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.201
No, just Danny
being Danny.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.210
Come on, come on, come on.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.578
Look, give me a break,

02:57.611 --> 02:58.946
I was only gone for,
like, a second.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.581
Nothing I can do,
I already wrote the ticket.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.316
You know what you could do?
You could bite me.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.851
TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT AGENT:
Sir, there's really no reason

03:03.884 --> 03:04.918
to use that language.
Uh-huh.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.520
And what are you
gonna do about it?

03:06.554 --> 03:07.855
MAN:
You ain't even
a real cop.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.391
Am I crazy or does
that look like Danny's guy?

03:10.424 --> 03:11.859
Have a nice day.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.495
You're a real credit
to society, you know that?

03:15.763 --> 03:17.365
Hey.
Hey-hey, guy.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.368
Hey.
Hey, get over here.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.702
Come on. Get out.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.304
Come on. Where's
the fire? Let's go.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.306
Come on, come on.
Get out of the car.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.940
Let's see some I.D.
Look, I'm gonna
pay the ticket.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.242
Your I.D.
Get it out.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.914
What'd I tell you?
Leo Packer.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.949
Good eye, Reagan.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.251
Up against the car.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.652
Hands behind your back.
Good eye.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.954
Jackpot, kid.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.557
This can't be right.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.259
What's that, sir?

03:45.293 --> 03:48.262
15,000 for postage?
You mean 1,500, right?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.931
Yeah, I'm afraid not.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.434
We're spending more on postage

03:53.467 --> 03:55.669
than I did
on my first house, Ed.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.904
Times they are a-changing.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.006
Cut it in half,
and I'm being generous.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.774
Morning.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.679
I need a minute.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.652
You're late.
It's Saturday.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.587
Technically I'm a day
and a half early.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.923
Some remarks for
your speech Monday.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.292
"It is with great honor
and swelling pride

04:18.326 --> 04:19.226
that I announce..."

04:19.259 --> 04:21.429
Councilman Singer
suggested some language.

04:21.462 --> 04:22.496
"Swelling Pride"?

04:22.530 --> 04:24.865
I'll give it a polish.
Good idea.

04:24.898 --> 04:28.602
Excuse me, Commissioner.
(whispering):
Commissioner...

04:28.636 --> 04:30.304
the secretary from
Homeland Security's

04:30.338 --> 04:32.406
here to see you.
He says it's urgent.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.974
Where do you have him?

04:34.007 --> 04:35.509
In the situation room, sir.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.889
(fingerprint reader beeps)

04:48.922 --> 04:50.290
(door unlocks)

04:59.600 --> 05:00.768
Secretary Price.

05:00.801 --> 05:01.902
Commissioner.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.804
How bad?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.607
Homeland Security has received
credible information

05:06.640 --> 05:09.610
that New York City will
come under attack

05:09.643 --> 05:11.845
in less than 24 hours.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.688
*

05:41.709 --> 05:43.411
Are you raising
the threat level?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.945
Not at this time.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.014
The three sleepers
who have gone missing

05:47.047 --> 05:48.582
are the main focus...
Lost.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.017
Excuse me?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.552
They have not gone missing.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.821
You have lost three
al-Qaeda sleepers.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.924
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.892
And now they are coming here.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.394
We believe so.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.696
In the next 24 hours.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.832
But you can't tell me where.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.400
Commissioner,
I can assure you

06:06.434 --> 06:07.901
Homeland Security,
the FBI,

06:07.935 --> 06:10.604
we are expending
every resource to ascertain

06:10.638 --> 06:12.606
that information.
That's not true.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.607
Sir?

06:13.641 --> 06:14.942
I didn't see the 82nd Airborne

06:14.975 --> 06:17.811
marching down Fifth Avenue--
that's a resource.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.879
Commissioner, we are doing...

06:18.912 --> 06:20.781
JFK and La Guardia
are still open,

06:20.814 --> 06:23.451
so the attack
isn't coming from the air.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.919
If it was a car bomb,
you would be asking me

06:25.953 --> 06:28.055
to close my bridges and tunnels.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.594
Good God, it's biologic.

06:46.674 --> 06:47.941
That's him.
Good job, kid.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.511
Just glad we got
a bad guy off the street.
Yep.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.880
You know, just for this,

06:52.913 --> 06:54.782
I may go pick up the roast.
Come on.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.149
Hey, hold on a second.
Where you taking him?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.751
What do you mean?
I got to process him.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.919
What do you mean?
This is my collar.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.054
Excuse me?
I brought him here for you to do

07:01.088 --> 07:02.490
interviews and run your
line ups,

07:02.523 --> 07:03.824
but this is my collar.
I arrested him.

07:03.857 --> 07:06.660
You arrested him because
I asked you to.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.761
Look, I gave his name,
I gave

07:07.795 --> 07:09.730
his picture-- I did everything
but draw you a map.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.931
But, Danny, come on,
you know the rules.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.600
You get the clearances.
I get the arrest.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.834
The rules? Rookie,
there are the rules,

07:13.867 --> 07:15.869
and then there is the way
things are done.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.738
Okay? Am I right
or am I right, Sarge?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.973
Hey, this is
a brother thing.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.509
Uh, come on with
the brother thing.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.843
This is a cop thing, okay?

07:22.876 --> 07:24.678
Now tell the kid,
Am I right or am I right?

07:24.712 --> 07:26.714
In that case I got to be
honest with you.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.881
It's Jamie's collar.

07:27.915 --> 07:30.183
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.620
This collar belongs
to the squad.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.221
Says who?
Says me.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.288
Oh, yeah?

07:35.322 --> 07:37.525
Last time that I checked,
three stripes outranks

07:37.558 --> 07:40.828
-a gold shield, Detective.
-Oh, you had to check, Sarge?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.963
And I don't appreciate
you talking to me like that.

07:42.996 --> 07:43.864
Guys, guys, guys.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.833
This is between me
and my kid brother.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.834
All right?

07:46.867 --> 07:47.801
And without me
you got squat.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.737
Which makes this my collar.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.938
My cuffs, my collar.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.506
Okay.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.808
Tell you what.
Let's me and you go have a talk.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.209
Okay?
Okay.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.878
MAN:
The good news is

07:57.911 --> 07:59.747
that we don't have
to be concerned

07:59.780 --> 08:01.148
with bridges
and tunnels.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.083
With a biologic
like this, boss,

08:03.116 --> 08:04.785
we're concentrating
our resources where

08:04.818 --> 08:07.120
we need them most--
in the subways.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.623
We're posting patrol units
at major subway stations

08:09.657 --> 08:10.924
for bag checks,

08:10.958 --> 08:13.761
and undercover
JTTF everywhere else

08:13.794 --> 08:14.695
to keep our profile low.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.697
To the general public,
and to the media,

08:16.730 --> 08:18.599
this will look no different
than one of our

08:18.632 --> 08:19.800
routine exercises.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.902
Jim,

08:21.935 --> 08:24.204
what exactly are we
looking at here?

08:24.237 --> 08:25.773
Well, to put it simply,

08:25.806 --> 08:26.974
it's the flu.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.776
Well, it's the flu
on steroids.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.845
Actually, it's a very rare
mutated strain.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.747
And what? Someone
just smashes a test tube

08:33.781 --> 08:34.882
on the subway platform?

08:34.915 --> 08:37.050
No. More likely,
their delivery mechanism

08:37.084 --> 08:38.986
would be a backpack sprayer.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.723
Expose this virus in an enclosed
space with little ventilation,

08:42.756 --> 08:44.558
and the results
would be extreme.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.959
How extreme?

08:45.993 --> 08:48.295
This thing gets released
in Times Square Station,

08:48.328 --> 08:49.797
what are we looking at?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.231
Well, depending on
how crowded it is,

08:51.264 --> 08:54.034
we could have upwards
of 50 people infected.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.936
Small children,

08:55.969 --> 08:57.605
the elderly, pregnant women

08:57.638 --> 08:59.039
would be the most
susceptible.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.676
But, really,
everyone is at risk.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.745
After that,
it's just math.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.046
In a week,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.616
the number would be 2,500.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.184
Another week,
and it's over six million.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.053
And that's if they
only hit one station.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.822
And there's no vaccine?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.624
No, sir.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.828
GARRETT: Well, all we
have to do is stop

09:20.861 --> 09:22.229
a large-scale pandemic
without letting anyone know

09:22.262 --> 09:24.197
we're looking for anything.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.167
Shouldn't be too hard in the
media capital of the world.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.038
Gentlemen,

09:31.071 --> 09:32.873
the sole advantage we have

09:32.906 --> 09:35.208
is, they don't know we're
looking for them.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.012
The city is home.

09:39.046 --> 09:42.049
We all have friends
and family here.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.985
Our most basic instinct

09:45.018 --> 09:46.887
is to protect our own

09:46.920 --> 09:49.156
above all else.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.692
As difficult as it will be...

09:51.725 --> 09:53.761
what was said in this room

09:53.794 --> 09:55.028
must be closely held...

09:55.062 --> 09:58.365
and shared only
on a need-to-know basis.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.106
We need to get these
sons of bitches.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.944
We'll reconvene
at 14:30 hours.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.848
Godspeed.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.121
(slams door)
So what's going on?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.189
What, you wake up

10:22.222 --> 10:24.091
and eat your Wheaties
this morning or something?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.258
Nothing's going on, Danny.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.359
Well, you could've fooled me.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.662
This is all clearly
stipulated in the guide book.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.997
This is all clearly
stipulated in the--

10:30.030 --> 10:31.665
what are you talking about?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.233
Do you even hear yourself?
You sound like a Harvard

10:33.266 --> 10:34.367
law professor, not even a cop.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.836
Here we go.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.870
Hey, the truth hurts.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.172
I've been on the job
over two years now, Danny.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.774
I have over 50 arrests.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.209
20 of them are felonies,

10:42.242 --> 10:43.944
and I have a successful
stint working undercover.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.913
So you can stop lecturing me
on what it means to be a cop.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.147
Well, look at you.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.415
Six months
doing part-time undercover

10:48.448 --> 10:49.449
and now you're what?
The freaking

10:49.482 --> 10:50.984
French Connection?
What are you gonna do next?

10:51.018 --> 10:52.986
Replace the old man
as commissioner?

10:53.020 --> 10:55.122
What is your problem? What the
hell did we ever do to you?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.824
Who's we?

10:56.857 --> 10:59.426
Who the hell are you
talking about, "we," Jamie?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.229
You talking about Joe?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.064
Let's just drop it.
No, no, no, no.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.066
You brought it up for a reason.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.101
You brought it up, so we're
gonna talk about it right now.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.269
No.

11:09.302 --> 11:10.704
Yes!

11:11.905 --> 11:13.741
Okay, he used to call
me up at school, okay?

11:13.774 --> 11:15.242
Tell me about the job,
how things were going.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.343
Will you get to the point?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.444
You know the point, Danny.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.980
You were a hard-ass to him,
just like you are to me.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.949
No matter how hard he tried,
no matter how well he did,

11:21.982 --> 11:23.917
he could never get
your respect.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.185
You're not walking out on me.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, wait, Danny!

11:31.158 --> 11:32.259
What the hell is
going on? Danny?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.027
(yelling)
Hey, hey, hey!

11:34.061 --> 11:36.229
Get off me!
Off, off, off, Danny!

11:36.263 --> 11:39.199
Hey! You, let's go.

11:39.232 --> 11:40.300
I'm not going anywhere
without...

11:40.333 --> 11:41.301
It's my prisoner.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.236
Hey, you, we're done.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.738
Do you hear me?

11:44.772 --> 11:45.705
X.O. just called.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.875
We got reassigned
to Chambers Street Station.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.078
What the hell?

11:51.111 --> 11:53.113
I'm fine.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.920
Release a joint statement and
a press conference to follow.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.022
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,
we can't do that.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.456
Says who, Frank?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.657
Washington?

12:04.691 --> 12:07.194
No, I answer to the people
of this city and nobody else.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.462
Do you really want to see
what it looks like

12:09.496 --> 12:13.033
when eight million people try to
leave this island all at once?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.835
We don't have to give specifics
about the virus.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.469
Only an awareness that we have
a credible threat...

12:16.503 --> 12:18.839
What do you think the city's
press is gonna do with that?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.040
Frank, I won't be known
as the mayor

12:20.073 --> 12:22.142
who could have saved millions
of lives but chose not to.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.177
You won't be saving lives,
Mr. Mayor.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.246
And you could be costing them.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.119
Frank, I have deferred
to you many times

12:32.152 --> 12:34.054
in these matters.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.823
But this is different.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.891
Now, it's my decision

12:37.925 --> 12:40.227
and my call, and I'm making it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.996
October 15, 2002.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.833
January 6, 2005.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.936
April 9, 2008.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.972
February 28, 2009.

12:52.005 --> 12:56.043
Those dates
mean anything to you?

12:56.076 --> 12:58.578
No, they don't; should they?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.981
Each one of those days

13:01.014 --> 13:04.051
had the potential to be
as infamous as September 11th.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.287
But we got a lead.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.956
We chased it down,

13:08.989 --> 13:11.058
and we stopped the attack
before it could happen.

13:11.091 --> 13:14.194
But what if you can't stop it
this time, Frank?

13:14.227 --> 13:17.497
What if this time
is the next time?

13:20.100 --> 13:23.236
Mr. Mayor,

13:23.270 --> 13:26.439
our city is the number one
terrorist target in the world.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.508
We need every advantage
we can get.

13:28.541 --> 13:31.011
And right now,

13:31.044 --> 13:34.181
that's us knowing
and them not.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.321
You have six hours, Frank.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.995
God help us.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.126
*

14:36.143 --> 14:38.545
Is everything okay with you
and your brother?

14:38.578 --> 14:40.680
What, are you looking
for a smack?

14:40.713 --> 14:41.982
I was just trying to be nice.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.450
Yeah, you're a
real sweetheart.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.019
Especially when it
comes to old ladies.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.654
This is from a
surveillance camera

14:47.687 --> 14:49.222
on Liz Whitaker's block,

14:49.256 --> 14:50.557
taken moments after
you robbed her.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.192
Oh, blue is definitely
not your color.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.460
You should stick
with earth tones.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.062
That isn't me.

14:56.596 --> 14:59.466
This is from Tina Swanson's
block after you robbed her.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.034
Not photogenic, Leo.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.402
No, he isn't.
Uh-uh.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.037
Well, last time I checked,

15:04.071 --> 15:06.173
it's not against the law
to walk down the street.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.376
Plus, you have nothing
connecting me to those women.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.610
You know, he's right.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.445
You know, that is one hell
of a point, Leo.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.647
It's too bad;
if only we had some evidence.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.517
Mm-hmm.
Some evidence to connect him
to those women.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.619
Yeah, maybe like some photos

15:19.652 --> 15:21.554
of Leo at the ATM machines

15:21.588 --> 15:22.789
using the cards
from the robberies.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.325
Well, now, that would help.
Oh, yeah, and what do you know?

15:25.358 --> 15:27.360
Huh.
Look what we
just happen to have.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.495
There's five years,

15:28.528 --> 15:30.330
ten years, 15
years, 20 years.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.564
Okay.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.666
Okay, all right, I get it.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.535
No, you get nothing.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.006
Have a nice life, Leo.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.240
(sighs)

15:40.273 --> 15:42.209
Wh-Wh-Wh...

15:42.242 --> 15:43.543
J-Just wait, okay?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.445
Wait, wait.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.015
What if I offer
you guys something, huh?

15:48.048 --> 15:50.550
Well, you better make it
really big.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.585
Well, how's the cover of the
Post; that big enough for you?

15:52.619 --> 15:54.221
(sighs)

15:54.254 --> 15:57.057
Fine.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.758
Fine, Leo. What do you got?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.528
Remember a few years ago,
there was that story

16:01.561 --> 16:04.464
about the kid who got snatched
up on his way home from school?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.733
Patrick Goodwin?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.335
Yeah, that's the one.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.270
I know who killed that kid.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.607
(yells)
Danny!
Danny!

16:14.641 --> 16:16.543
Get off him! Danny!
You better be telling the truth!

16:16.576 --> 16:17.677
You better...
Danny, get off him.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.679
Get out! Out!

16:19.712 --> 16:21.714
Sit down.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.256
Don't kill the messenger.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.125
75 minutes till the
mayor pulls the plug.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.129
What have you got, Ed?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.264
Boss,

16:37.297 --> 16:38.698
we picked up some chatter

16:38.731 --> 16:40.767
off of one of our wires
that puts the Three Blind Mice

16:40.800 --> 16:42.535
in a fleabag motel
in Queens.

16:42.569 --> 16:44.304
We think they're talking
about our guys.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.673
Have ESU briefed
and ready to go on my order.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.041
Yes, sir.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.242
(phone ringing)

16:53.246 --> 16:54.447
Hey, sweetie.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.283
Hi, are you still
in the city?

16:56.316 --> 16:59.119
Yeah, I'm stuck in my office.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.221
Great, 'cause we're
coming in a little early.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.356
We're about to hop
on the subway.
What?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.657
But you don't have to come down.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.459
I'll walk her over, okay?

17:06.493 --> 17:09.629
Oh, yeah, sure, okay.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.164
Okay, thanks, Dad.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.566
And thanks
for making me do this.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.667
Well, I love you, sweetie.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.237
I love you, too.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.574
I promised Erin I'd watch Nicky.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.677
Well, safer here than out there.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.754
I'm sorry, Jack.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.423
I mean, you do know what happens

17:36.456 --> 17:38.358
if you smash the guy's head
through the window?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.193
Yeah, I get suspended.
Mm-hmm.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.661
No gun, no shield.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.163
Again.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.198
You know
what else happens again?

17:45.232 --> 17:47.334
I get called down to I.A.,

17:47.367 --> 17:48.668
and if I tell the truth,

17:48.701 --> 17:50.270
I jam you up,
and if I don't

17:50.303 --> 17:52.205
tell the truth,
I jam myself up.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.740
Either way,
been there, done that.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.808
This is Patrick Goodwin.

17:55.842 --> 17:58.511
Do you know why I carry his
picture around in my wallet?

17:58.545 --> 18:00.213
Because this isn't
just some cold case

18:00.247 --> 18:02.515
that that mutt is hawking,
it's my cold case.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.751
I did not know.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.253
I know; how could you?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.521
You know how it is.

18:08.555 --> 18:10.423
Every cop's got that one case
they can't shake,

18:10.457 --> 18:12.125
the one that
keeps them up at night

18:12.159 --> 18:15.295
like a dog gnawing on a bone;
well, for me, this is that one.

18:15.328 --> 18:17.864
(exhales)
What happened?

18:17.897 --> 18:20.433
It was before you got here.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.769
He was four years old, there was
a mix-up at the school,

18:22.802 --> 18:24.237
they thought the mom got him,

18:24.271 --> 18:25.705
the mom thought
the neighbor got him,

18:25.738 --> 18:28.875
and then, poof,
he vanished into thin air.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.245
Well, did you ever get close?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.746
No, you know how it
is with missing kids.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.881
The first 12 hours
are critical.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.384
It was four hours before
anybody even knew he was gone.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.286
The mom must be crazy.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.720
(scoffs) Tell me about it.

18:40.753 --> 18:42.822
She lost her husband
the year prior.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.894
Yeah. I spent plenty of time
trying to talk her off a ledge.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.929
What's this mutt got
to say for himself?

18:49.962 --> 18:52.332
Well, look, he says he used
to know this guy

18:52.365 --> 18:53.633
a little bit
from the neighborhood.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.268
This guys came around
one night.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.604
He's drunk; he starts spewing
all this crazy stuff

18:57.637 --> 18:59.872
about how he knew something
about the boy that went missing.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.342
Of course, typical;
sounds rock-solid.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.344
I thought the same thing until,
you know,

19:04.377 --> 19:06.279
I ran this guy's name,
Keith Daley.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.847
He dropped off the face
of the earth

19:07.880 --> 19:09.582
shortly after that boy
went missing.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.618
Why don't you show
me what you got.
Yeah.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.788
DANNY: You do understand

19:15.822 --> 19:18.558
this is pretty much
a long shot, right, Anna?

19:18.591 --> 19:19.759
Yeah, Danny, I know.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.562
Okay, just don't want
to stir things up

19:22.595 --> 19:24.297
and start getting your hopes up.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.966
Hope? What's that?

19:26.999 --> 19:30.237
I just don't want you
to be disappointed again.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.838
More importantly,

19:31.871 --> 19:35.375
I don't want you
getting hurt all over again.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.247
Danny, it's been two years,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.982
and I still don't know what
happened to my Patrick.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.851
I know.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.354
I live every day,

19:47.387 --> 19:51.858
haunted by the gruesome
scenarios my mind imagines.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.893
And then,

19:53.926 --> 19:56.763
the questions come.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.832
Did they torture him?

19:59.866 --> 20:02.602
Did they beat him?

20:02.635 --> 20:06.506
Did he scream out for his mommy?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
(crying)

20:08.575 --> 20:10.543
I think we should
get started, okay?

20:13.480 --> 20:16.849
The name Keith Daley,
does it mean anything to you?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.252
No.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.554
Okay, well, that name
was brought to my attention

20:21.588 --> 20:23.690
as someone...

20:23.723 --> 20:26.025
who may have had something to do
with Patrick's disappearance.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.561
He has no criminal record,

20:28.595 --> 20:32.299
nothing suggesting a history
of foul play against children,

20:32.332 --> 20:35.868
no sexual assaults,
no violent crimes.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.338
This is a copy of his
driver's license photo.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.440
You let me know if
you recognize him.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.809
Oh, my God.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.378
You know him?

20:45.412 --> 20:47.547
Yes, he was...

20:47.580 --> 20:50.450
He worked in the
parking garage

20:50.483 --> 20:52.719
across the street from
where we used to live.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.554
Okay, hold on.
Are you sure that's him?

20:54.587 --> 20:55.922
Positive, yes.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.390
We saw him every day.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.592
He was... he was
our parking guy.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.461
Okay, so he knew Patrick.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.929
More importantly,
Patrick knew him.

21:02.962 --> 21:03.863
He knew this guy?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.898
Yes, yes.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.967
He used to...

21:08.000 --> 21:10.637
He would high-five with
Patrick every morning.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.871
Okay, so Patrick trusted him.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.507
I mean, at least enough to not
think of him as a stranger?

21:14.541 --> 21:16.809
Oh, my God, Danny, is
this really happening?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.612
Is this... Did he
do this to my baby?

21:19.646 --> 21:21.814
I don't know.
Look, I don't know about that.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.451
Let's-let's take this
one step at a time, okay?

21:24.484 --> 21:25.952
This is just a possibility.

21:25.985 --> 21:28.888
Danny Reagan, I want you
to make me a promise.

21:28.921 --> 21:33.893
I want you to promise me right
now that you will find my baby,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.061
wherever he is.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.397
and you bring him to his mother,

21:37.430 --> 21:39.832
and you let me bury my baby boy.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.968
(sobbing)

21:42.001 --> 21:44.771
(sighs) I'm trying.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.441
I'm trying.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.080
We've got helmet
cams on ESU,

21:54.113 --> 21:56.115
so we'll be able to see
everything, Commissioner.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.917
Ready to go on your order, sir.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.018
Go.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.760
Clear.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.962
(sighs)

22:10.997 --> 22:12.432
Clear.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.505
They were just here.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.872
We missed 'em,
Commissioner.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.073
Find 'em.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.848
Hey, there they are.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.418
Told you he'd
just be a minute.
Hi, sweetie.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.954
Ah.
Hi, Grandpa.

22:34.987 --> 22:37.557
Sorry, I was in the middle
of something. How are you guys?

22:37.590 --> 22:38.791
Starving.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.159
I'll get you some food.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.894
Thought Linda was coming.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.664
Well, she wanted to see
Danny before we went out.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.966
It seems really busy
in here for a Saturday.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.968
Think I should put in
for a raise?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.036
Very funny.

22:50.069 --> 22:50.937
How are you?

22:51.971 --> 22:53.806
Busy.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.985
So, where are you
guys going tonight?

23:06.018 --> 23:08.755
The Boom Boom Room.
You worried?

23:08.788 --> 23:09.822
No.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.891
Should I be worried?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.593
Very.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.964
You're gonna be
all right with this
whole thing with Jamie.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.633
Yeah, I'll be fine.
It'll blow over.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.135
Unless you don't want it
to blow over.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.137
Why wouldn't I want it to?

23:25.171 --> 23:27.507
Well, Danny, you know,
sometimes I think

23:27.540 --> 23:29.909
things like this
are an opportunity.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.878
Opportunity for what, Linda?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.946
Tomorrow's Mother's Day.
I know that.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.583
Yeah, well, as nice
as our holidays are,

23:36.616 --> 23:38.050
'cause we all get together,

23:38.084 --> 23:39.819
they're also
kind of hard, you know?

23:39.852 --> 23:42.522
Because the truth is,
not all of us are there.

23:42.555 --> 23:45.558
What are you saying, this has
something to do with my mom?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.927
No.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.496
Who, Joe?

23:49.529 --> 23:51.798
What are you
talking about?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.833
You're... Jamie
had no right

23:53.866 --> 23:56.536
to throw Joe's name
in my face, okay?
Danny, yes, he did.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.704
Why?

23:57.737 --> 23:59.806
(sighs)

23:59.839 --> 24:01.941
You know, Joe...

24:01.974 --> 24:03.810
was like... like the only thing

24:03.843 --> 24:05.978
that you and Jamie
had in common.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.580
You know?

24:07.614 --> 24:09.115
He was the bridge
between you two,

24:09.148 --> 24:11.183
and now, you know...

24:11.217 --> 24:13.452
Joe is gone.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.158
Sorry.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.529
Suppose you're right.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.831
What is the opportunity
you're talking about?

24:26.232 --> 24:28.535
Build a new bridge.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.907
(sighs)

24:42.849 --> 24:45.818
Hey, Jack, any luck
on our ghost, Keith Daley?

24:45.852 --> 24:47.887
This guy is totally
off the grid.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.722
Great.

24:49.756 --> 24:51.290
Let's see.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.659
No license, no bank
account, no tax returns.

24:52.692 --> 24:56.062
Were you able to get
in touch with his boss
in the parking garage?

24:56.095 --> 24:57.964
Yeah. Says he
was a solid worker,

24:57.997 --> 24:59.666
until one day
he started acting weird,

24:59.699 --> 25:01.968
kind of paranoid,
and then he just up and quits.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.703
Okay, did he confirm
that Daley quit

25:03.736 --> 25:05.004
around the time that
Patrick went missing?

25:05.037 --> 25:06.138
Same month.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.174
Daley quits,
empties his bank accounts,

25:08.207 --> 25:09.842
pulls a Houdini.
Right.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.744
Maybe it was getting
hot in the kitchen.

25:11.778 --> 25:14.046
He must have figured
it was only a matter of time

25:14.080 --> 25:15.748
before we strung
a homicide around his neck.

25:15.782 --> 25:16.983
Am I crazy?

25:17.016 --> 25:18.217
No.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.086
Do we have a last
known address on this guy?

25:20.119 --> 25:21.588
Yeah, he used to live
with his mother.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.624
Mother?
Mm-hmm.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.561
It was a bold call,
Frank-- a call

25:28.595 --> 25:30.129
nobody else would've
had the guts to make.

25:30.162 --> 25:32.298
But my six hours are up.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.600
And I understand
your disappointment.

25:33.633 --> 25:38.270
Now, your arguments for
pursuing this course
are more than valid,

25:38.304 --> 25:40.640
but I'm afraid we're
at the point where the risk

25:40.673 --> 25:41.841
outweighs the reward.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.075
The risk, Mr. Mayor,

25:43.109 --> 25:45.177
is in allowing
political considerations

25:45.211 --> 25:47.013
to get in the way.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.615
(sighs)

25:48.648 --> 25:50.983
This is not a purely
political decision, Frank.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.551
I know it's not.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.857
We'll agree to disagree,
Commissioner.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.060
(sighing):
Mr. Mayor...

26:01.093 --> 26:04.931
if you go out there on TV
and announce this to the public,

26:04.964 --> 26:07.600
those three terrorists will
burrow so far underground,

26:07.634 --> 26:10.002
they will come out
on the other side of the world.

26:10.036 --> 26:12.071
Good. And hopefully,
they'll stay there.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.041
No, they won't.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.110
These aren't mercenaries,
Mr. Mayor.

26:18.144 --> 26:21.047
They're radical fundamentalists,
they're messianic.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.852
And they still have the virus,
and they will come back here...

26:25.885 --> 26:29.155
and they will try it
again and again and again.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.322
And we will face
those challenges,

26:30.356 --> 26:31.624
Frank, as they
present themselves.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.760
No, we won't!

26:35.061 --> 26:38.765
Because we won't know
when the next time's coming.

26:42.168 --> 26:45.672
Frank, the press conference
is in one hour, my office.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.406
Don't be late.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.308
(sighs)

26:49.341 --> 26:51.177
I serve at your
pleasure, Mr. Mayor,

26:51.210 --> 26:52.979
and I will be there.

26:53.012 --> 26:56.115
But it will be my
last press conference.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.688
Frank?

27:01.721 --> 27:05.157
I will be carrying
my letter of resignation.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.030
As you wish.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.435
(sighs)

27:16.468 --> 27:17.804
(door closes)

27:17.837 --> 27:19.806
Hey.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.374
She looks innocent,
but deep down,
she's an assassin.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.811
He's crying,
'cause I just crushed him

27:24.844 --> 27:26.045
at Words with Friends.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.015
GARRETT:
80 points
for "quiz."

27:29.048 --> 27:31.250
I'm gonna go study
my thesaurus.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.057
What's going on around here?

27:38.090 --> 27:40.392
Nothing.
Business as usual.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.395
Is it usually this busy
on a Saturday night?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.965
City that never sleeps.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.203
Grandpa, can I say something?

27:51.237 --> 27:52.271
I don't know, can you?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.040
May Isay something?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.241
Yes, you may.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.244
You look sad.

28:06.052 --> 28:09.488
Are you... sad because
tomorrow is Mother's Day?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.257
That's part of it.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.226
You really loved Grandma
a lot, huh?

28:14.260 --> 28:15.762
She was easy to love.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.163
(laughs)

28:17.196 --> 28:19.031
Grandpa, you're so cute.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.032
I get that a lot.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.169
I hope I can fall in love
like that someday.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.204
So do I.

28:26.773 --> 28:29.776
Just as long as it's not
for another 20 years.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.313
Something bad
is happening, isn't it?

28:37.984 --> 28:38.985
(sighs)

28:39.986 --> 28:41.720
It could be.

28:44.123 --> 28:47.126
Sorry, sweetie.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.762
There are some things
I can't talk about.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.330
Even to me?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.165
Your only granddaughter?

28:53.199 --> 28:55.734
Even to you.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.171
Then no wonder you're sad.

29:00.206 --> 29:02.074
(door opens)

29:02.108 --> 29:03.843
Frank, we have something.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.247
I understand.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.515
Go on.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.023
(sighs)

29:17.056 --> 29:18.157
JACKIE: Okay, Mrs. Daley,

29:18.190 --> 29:20.259
if you hear from your son
Keith, give us a call.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.528
Okay, is it just me,
or does that woman

29:22.561 --> 29:25.531
obviously know more
than she's telling us?
She knows something.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.066
Just how do we prove it?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.567
What if we put
a tail on her

29:28.600 --> 29:30.469
and see if she leads
us right to him?

29:30.502 --> 29:34.173
Or we could let him
come to us-- I mean,
what's tomorrow, after all?

29:34.206 --> 29:35.875
Even Al Capone called home
on Mother's Day.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.444
Want to go up
on her phone?
Yeah, let's get a warrant.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.246
(elevator bell dings)

29:53.059 --> 29:55.094
I never liked
this room.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.129
Too many secrets.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.199
Everything okay?

30:00.232 --> 30:01.934
(sighs)
When you called me

30:01.968 --> 30:05.337
about taking Nicky home,
you didn't sound so good.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.208
I'm sitting in your chair, Pop.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.146
What is it, Francis?

30:15.181 --> 30:17.850
I said something tonight.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.286
I only meant it
as a threat.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.990
But now that
I've said it...

30:24.023 --> 30:26.192
What'd you say?

30:27.894 --> 30:31.463
Pop, when'd you know when it
was time to step down as P.C.?

30:34.033 --> 30:36.068
(sighs)

30:36.102 --> 30:38.938
Well, let me ask you this.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.177
When did you know
you were in love?

30:45.211 --> 30:46.612
(chuckles)

30:46.645 --> 30:50.216
Well, you know Mary--
she told me when I was in love.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.317
Sure she did.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.254
(sighs)

30:55.287 --> 30:57.156
All day...

30:57.189 --> 31:00.192
we have been after some people
looking to attack this city

31:00.226 --> 31:02.028
with a mutated virus.

31:02.061 --> 31:05.364
You shouldn't be
telling me this, Francis.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.933
No.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.037
I shouldn't.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.308
We arrested 'em
about an hour ago.

31:18.577 --> 31:21.380
Two highway patrolmen
acting on intel

31:21.413 --> 31:24.416
got 'em coming over
into Williamsburg.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.954
(sighs)

31:27.987 --> 31:30.456
They were headed
for Grand Central Station.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.563
(sighs)

31:37.596 --> 31:40.299
Secrets and lies.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.370
I'm tired, Pop.

31:44.403 --> 31:47.239
The kind of tired
you can't sleep off.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.278
It's not the big stuff.

31:52.311 --> 31:55.547
Hell... it's easy
to make decisions

31:55.581 --> 31:59.218
to protect eight million people
on this island.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.489
(sighs)
What's hard...

32:05.524 --> 32:09.028
...is knowing how that affects
one single person.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.366
One single family.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.240
And if you lose sight of that...

32:24.243 --> 32:26.545
...you lose your humanity.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.357
REPORTER:
I'm standing in the shadows
of the Williamsburg Bridge

32:38.390 --> 32:40.626
where some highly unusual
police activity

32:40.659 --> 32:42.361
has gotten this
neighborhood buzzing.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.430
Speculation has
really run the gamut here.

32:44.463 --> 32:45.998
Some people think

32:46.032 --> 32:48.367
that it's a massive drug bust,
while others believe

32:48.400 --> 32:51.003
the NYPD's confiscated
a dirty bomb.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.271
We've even heard from some

32:52.304 --> 32:53.405
who believe there's
an extraterrestrial

32:53.439 --> 32:55.174
inside that tent.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.043
Well, here to tell us
what's really going on

32:57.076 --> 32:58.077
is Garrett Moore,

32:58.110 --> 33:00.646
the Deputy Commissioner
of Public Information.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.415
Well, Maria, I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

33:03.449 --> 33:06.185
but E.T. has not
phoned home.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.287
Uh, but all kidding aside,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.556
what you're seeing here
is nothing more

33:10.589 --> 33:15.527
than a-an exercise, uh,
a fire drill if you will.

33:15.561 --> 33:17.763
MARIA:
Okay, but why now and why here

33:17.796 --> 33:20.332
and why no advance notice
for the neighborhood?

33:20.366 --> 33:21.300
GARRETT:
Well, without getting

33:21.333 --> 33:24.503
into too much detail
about our procedures,

33:24.536 --> 33:26.738
in order for this exercise
to be successful,

33:26.772 --> 33:29.441
it's important for everybody,
including our officers,

33:29.475 --> 33:31.143
to believe the situation
to be real.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.778
MARIA: Okay, so this was
obviously something that was

33:32.811 --> 33:34.813
in the works for quite
a while. Is that true?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.782
Of course it is.

33:36.815 --> 33:38.550
GARRETT:
This actually happens several
times on a regular basis.

33:38.584 --> 33:39.485
Ultimately, the police
are out here

33:39.518 --> 33:41.620
to make sure we're safe
and taken care of,

33:41.653 --> 33:42.788
so there were no incidents.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.169
Good to see you.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.205
God bless you.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.506
Father.
God bless you.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.508
That was
a wonderful service.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.543
Very moving.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.614
Why wasn't
Grandpa at mass?

34:09.815 --> 34:11.783
Well, your grandpa
is working,

34:11.817 --> 34:13.752
but he said he'd make it
home in time for dinner.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.787
Okay.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.360
You know something,
don't you?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.428
Know what?

34:22.461 --> 34:25.497
You forget what I
do for a living?

34:25.531 --> 34:27.333
What's really going on?

34:27.366 --> 34:29.135
Don't ask.

34:29.168 --> 34:30.836
Dad okay?

34:31.870 --> 34:35.141
He's pretty beat up.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.543
He was talking
about resigning last night.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.545
NICKY:
We have to get back.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.413
It's going to take me
at least an hour

34:41.447 --> 34:42.648
to make Grandpa's potatoes.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.551
(chuckles)
Okay.

34:45.584 --> 34:47.686
You heard anything
from Jackie yet?

34:47.719 --> 34:50.322
Not yet.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.559
Danny.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.427
What?

34:55.461 --> 34:57.529
Come on,
they're fine.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.366
They're going to ruin
their Sunday clothes.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.568
Okay, I'll go
talk to them.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.602
Okay.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.673
All right, guys,

35:07.706 --> 35:08.840
come on, get up, knock it off,

35:08.874 --> 35:10.242
you're going to ruin
your good clothes.

35:13.445 --> 35:17.516
It's like déjà vu
all over again, huh?

35:17.549 --> 35:19.185
Seems like it was
just yesterday--

35:19.218 --> 35:21.653
me, you, and Joe rolling
around in the grass fighting.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.555
Yeah, only Jack's not
handing out dead legs

35:23.589 --> 35:25.157
like it's Halloween candy.

35:25.191 --> 35:28.227
Yeah, you'll have
to teach him about that.

35:28.260 --> 35:32.364
(phone ringing)

35:32.398 --> 35:33.365
Now she calls.

35:33.399 --> 35:35.867
Hey, Jack.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.370
You're kidding me.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.438
No, no,
I'm on my way.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.173
Shoot me
the address.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.174
Linda,

35:42.208 --> 35:44.210
I got to go, babe.
Bye.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.645
Hey, what's up?
My guy Keith Daley
called his mother.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.514
Number comes back
to a house here in Brooklyn.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.515
You up for it?

35:49.548 --> 35:50.916
Want me to back you up?

35:50.949 --> 35:53.352
That is, unless you think
you can't handle it.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.486
Yeah, let's go.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.455
Come on.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.631
Gentlemen.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.736
Well done.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.305
Go home to your families.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.341
Thank you, sir.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.476
Thank you, sir.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.745
Thanks, Jim.

36:19.778 --> 36:20.746
Good job, sir.

36:20.779 --> 36:22.781
Thanks for the great
weekend.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.609
MAN:
Who is it?

36:50.642 --> 36:52.344
Uh, I got a delivery here.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.513
All right, hang on.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.882
Yeah.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.016
Keith Daley, I'm
Detective Reagan

36:58.049 --> 36:59.418
with the NYPD.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.453
I need to ask you
some questions.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.590
Hey!

37:04.623 --> 37:05.657
Come here!

37:05.691 --> 37:08.560
Police!
Don't move!

37:08.594 --> 37:10.696
Get up!

37:10.729 --> 37:12.298
Ahh!
Spread your legs!

37:12.331 --> 37:14.700
Where the hell
you going, huh?

37:14.733 --> 37:15.934
You got it
all wrong, okay?

37:15.967 --> 37:17.603
I never hurt him,
I never laid a hand on him.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.371
You never laid a
hand on him, huh?

37:19.405 --> 37:21.640
I didn't even tell you what
you're under arrest for, punk.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.476
Robin, Robin told me
I had to or she'd leave me.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.477
Yeah, who's Robin?

37:25.511 --> 37:26.578
My girlfriend.

37:26.612 --> 37:27.579
Your girlfriend, huh?

37:27.613 --> 37:28.514
So what the hell

37:28.547 --> 37:29.848
is your girlfriend
telling you to kidnap

37:29.881 --> 37:31.317
and kill a
little kid for?

37:31.350 --> 37:32.318
Kill him?
Yeah.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.685
No, no, no,
you got it all wrong.

37:33.719 --> 37:34.753
Oh, really?
Listen to me, yeah.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.887
She was going crazy.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.323
We just had
our third miscarriage.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.690
She said that
if she couldn't have a baby,

37:38.724 --> 37:39.925
that she was going
to kill herself.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.294
You telling me
he's still alive?

37:42.328 --> 37:44.896
Were you telling me that
Patrick's still alive, huh?

37:44.930 --> 37:46.632
Where is he?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.335
Where is he?!
All right, all right.

37:49.368 --> 37:50.936
He's at the park
with his mother.

37:50.969 --> 37:53.539
(panting)

37:53.572 --> 37:55.707
She ain't his mother.

37:55.741 --> 37:56.742
WOMAN:
Hello?

38:02.481 --> 38:04.483
Patrick?

38:07.353 --> 38:09.355
Patrick.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.670
(car door opens)

38:29.841 --> 38:31.843
Come on.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.983
There's your mom.
Go see her.

38:41.787 --> 38:45.691
Patrick, it's me.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.494
Mommy.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.732
Do you remember me?

38:56.435 --> 38:57.669
Mommy.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.814
You wanted to know
why I became a cop.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.583
You don't get a feeling
like that making partner.

39:11.617 --> 39:12.684
Yeah.

39:12.718 --> 39:15.687
I just need you
to fill out some papers.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.026
Look, I was out of line.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.695
I got no right to tell you
whether you should be a cop

39:23.729 --> 39:25.397
or a lawyer or anything else.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.534
We were both out of line.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.569
Maybe.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.706
I know you and Joe were close.

39:36.775 --> 39:39.144
I miss him.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.146
I miss him every day.

39:41.179 --> 39:43.849
I know you do.

39:43.882 --> 39:44.883
He loved you, Danny.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.958
You were his best friend.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.763
So, how come you and I
are just brothers?

39:57.796 --> 39:59.798
I don't know.

40:01.199 --> 40:03.469
Maybe that's something
we could work on, huh?

40:03.502 --> 40:05.036
I'm up for that.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.576
Better get home
for dinner.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.611
Yeah.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.849
By the way, that was
my collar yesterday.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.885
Oh, here we go.

40:27.593 --> 40:28.860
LINDA:
That's very good.

40:28.894 --> 40:29.861
Nice pour.

40:29.895 --> 40:30.929
(Jamie laughs)

40:30.962 --> 40:34.800
That was an incredible
thing you guys did today.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.502
I'm really
proud of you.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.672
Yeah, returning
a missing child

40:40.706 --> 40:42.107
to his mother
on Mother's Day--

40:42.140 --> 40:43.809
that's the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.044
I know, I almost feel bad

40:46.077 --> 40:47.879
that you're waiting on us
hand and foot.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.648
Yeah.
HENRY:
Yeah.

40:49.681 --> 40:50.616
Almost.

40:50.649 --> 40:51.550
(laughing):
Yeah.

40:51.583 --> 40:52.751
More meat, please.

40:52.784 --> 40:53.985
More meat for your mom, buddy.

40:54.019 --> 40:55.887
I've been waiting
on Mom all day.

40:55.921 --> 40:57.489
(Henry chuckles)

40:57.523 --> 40:59.725
Hey, we did it for our mother,
now it's your turn.

40:59.758 --> 41:00.726
It's no fair.

41:00.759 --> 41:01.960
Why isn't there a Kid's Day?

41:01.993 --> 41:02.961
Are you kidding me?

41:02.994 --> 41:04.896
It's Kid's Day every day.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.231
And last but not least,

41:06.264 --> 41:09.935
the world-famous
Frank Reagan Mother's Day Mash.

41:09.968 --> 41:10.936
Can I serve it?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.504
Only Grandpa serves those.

41:12.538 --> 41:13.905
That is exactly
correct.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.140
Hey, everybody.
Just in time, Dad.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.141
Sorry, Pop.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.809
Hi, Grandpa.
Hi, Grandpa.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.811
Thanks for making it
for me, Nicky.

41:19.845 --> 41:20.946
They're
a little lumpy.

41:20.979 --> 41:24.950
Well, that's exactly the way
your grandmother liked it.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.785
Did you talk to the mayor?

41:26.818 --> 41:29.020
No, but I sent him
a letter.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.190
LINDA:
Thanks.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.559
I sent him my recipe

41:33.592 --> 41:36.294
for my famous Mother's Day Mash.

41:36.327 --> 41:39.097
(laughs)

41:41.933 --> 41:43.902
Well, we ready to eat?

DANNY: Mm-hmm.
Yes, please.
Sure.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.840
Sean, you're the youngest.

41:48.874 --> 41:51.877
We thank you, God,
for our mothers.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.013
I thank you
that she gave me life

41:55.046 --> 41:57.515
and nurtured me
all of those years.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.619
LINDA:
She gave me my faith,

42:00.652 --> 42:03.722
helped me to know you and
to know Jesus and his ways.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.023
She taught me how to love.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.959
And how to sacrifice for others.

42:07.993 --> 42:11.863
She taught me it was okay to cry
and to always tell the truth.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.001
Bless her
with the graces she needs

42:16.034 --> 42:18.069
and which you want
to give her today.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.574
Help her to feel precious
in your eyes today

42:22.608 --> 42:24.309
and to know
that I love her.

42:24.342 --> 42:28.313
Give her strength and courage,
compassion and peace.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.816
ALL:
Bless her this day
with your love. Amen.
