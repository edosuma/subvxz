04:43.008 --> 04:44.265
You are?

04:44.267 --> 04:45.692

Jerry, you're fired.

04:47.195 --> 04:49.621
I'm... I'm free.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.940
Segment producer?

04:52.942 --> 04:54.293
I don't know.
I-I should probably

04:54.295 --> 04:57.337
talk it over with my family.
(gasps)

05:01.951 --> 05:04.303
I'll take the job.

05:05.197 --> 05:06.954
Be warned, segment producer.

05:06.956 --> 05:09.641
No one makes it out of these
shows unchanged.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.145
Oh, well, then it's a good thing
I'm not much of a changer.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.981
You can keep your job
or you can keep your soul,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.207
but you can't keep both.

05:17.209 --> 05:19.709
Also, when you
turn in your receipts,

05:19.711 --> 05:22.546
break them down
between dining and mileage

05:22.548 --> 05:25.306
or you'll await
the reimbursements...

05:25.308 --> 05:26.491
forever!

05:31.981 --> 05:35.725
So this is behind the scenes
of a TV show.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.894
So much hustle.

05:37.896 --> 05:39.421
And bustle.

05:42.734 --> 05:44.384
Mm... mm.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.070
This is your desk.

05:47.072 --> 05:50.407
And this is where you can pin
all your genius segment ideas.

05:50.409 --> 05:52.184
With five shows a week,
it's very important

05:52.186 --> 05:54.744
that you always
be thinking up segments.

05:54.746 --> 05:55.854
A daytime talk show without

05:55.856 --> 05:58.748
fun and interesting segments
is like a...

05:58.750 --> 06:00.750
You, finish my metaphor.

06:00.752 --> 06:02.027
Uh, um...

06:02.029 --> 06:04.363
Get me a baked potato

06:04.365 --> 06:06.865
so I can throw it at your head.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.092
-Now!
-(exclaims, whimpers)

06:09.094 --> 06:12.162
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

06:13.115 --> 06:15.356
(humming a tune)

06:15.358 --> 06:17.209
Oh, I-I don't need
to order lunch.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.712
My kids packed mine as a
special treat for my first day.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.589
Aw.

06:24.776 --> 06:27.794
Hmm. Maybe I will
take a look at that menu.

06:27.796 --> 06:31.464
Can I order you something, um...
What-what's your name?

06:31.466 --> 06:33.633
Uh, to make it simpler
for the producers,

06:33.635 --> 06:35.185
we're-we're all named Jordan.

06:39.382 --> 06:41.141
I should've ordered some salad

06:41.143 --> 06:44.653
to go with my salad toppings.
(chuckles)

06:45.964 --> 06:48.365

What the hell is this?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.493
You people
didn't write me any jokes.

07:00.495 --> 07:03.070
You don't need jokes.
The women in our audience

07:03.072 --> 07:05.148
are just happy
to be out of the house.

07:05.150 --> 07:07.926
They want to dance to
clean versions of Pitbull songs

07:07.928 --> 07:11.412
and go home with a free copy
of a<i> Real Housewives</i> memoir.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.673
Your only job is just be nice.

07:13.675 --> 07:15.708
It's all about nice.

07:15.710 --> 07:18.662
Did you just make eye contact
with the host?

07:18.664 --> 07:20.013
No, I would never!

07:20.015 --> 07:21.014

Can you believe

We don't.

Bart, you're taking this

08:42.672 --> 08:44.748
I'd have thought
you'd be hatching some scheme

08:44.750 --> 08:46.340
to get the old Krusty show back.

08:46.342 --> 08:47.600
Why would I do that?

08:47.602 --> 08:50.270
I've got my favorite Krusty
episodes right here.

08:50.272 --> 08:52.364
More than 700 of 'em.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.775
Hm, kind of makes you think.

08:55.777 --> 08:58.428
Once you have enough episodes
of any classic show,

08:58.430 --> 09:00.597
why do you need
to keep making more?

09:00.599 --> 09:02.356
Well, the reason is...

09:02.358 --> 09:04.025
Shh.
Watching classic Krusty.

09:04.027 --> 09:06.211
(Krusty the Clown

09:08.106 --> 09:09.956
Oh, it's just so easy.

09:09.958 --> 09:11.791
I don't
have to be funny anymore.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.109
I just have to be nice.

09:13.111 --> 09:15.536

I've ever done.

09:15.538 --> 09:19.391

09:21.878 --> 09:25.138
You know, we women have to
stick together in this business.

09:25.140 --> 09:27.307
But I also want you
to never quite be sure

Homie, I'm so sorry I'm late.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.194
You would not believe
the day I had.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.955
Oh, please, let's eat.
I'm starving.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.032
Oh, but if the bill looks high,
it's because

10:26.034 --> 10:28.543
I already ate a full meal here.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.855
And then Krusty
didn't even tell us

10:31.857 --> 10:33.781
he had swapped
the A and B blocks.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.133
I'd already preset
the demo table

10:35.135 --> 10:38.194
for my segment,
"popcorn maker wars."

10:38.196 --> 10:39.638
So, then it's my fault

10:39.640 --> 10:41.956
the "reuniting soldiers
and their dogs" segment

10:41.958 --> 10:43.700
was such a disaster?

10:43.702 --> 10:46.794
Carla's the one who
turned on the popcorn machines.

10:46.796 --> 10:49.147
And that's
Hair Department Carla?

10:49.149 --> 10:51.983
No, Hair Department Carla
is blonde.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.060
You know, my day
was pretty crazy, too.

10:54.062 --> 10:57.380
Lenny came in this morning
with a ladybug on his shirt,

10:57.382 --> 11:00.383
and we were seeing how long
before he noticed it.

11:00.385 --> 11:02.994
Segment idea:
"Krusty goes blond."

11:02.996 --> 11:04.329
(laughs)

11:04.331 --> 11:06.665
Lenny made it
all the way to lunch

11:06.667 --> 11:09.409
and then the little guy
just fell off on its own.

11:09.411 --> 11:11.060
(laughs)

11:11.062 --> 11:12.987
We called him Ladybug Lenny

11:12.989 --> 11:14.822
for the rest of the day!

11:14.824 --> 11:16.232
(laughs)

11:16.234 --> 11:18.843
-Ah, ladybugs.
-(phone dings)

11:18.845 --> 11:21.012
Oh, I have to go back
to the office.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.256
The viral skateboard grandma
we booked for tomorrow

11:23.258 --> 11:26.059
has a history of racist tweets.

11:27.262 --> 11:30.563
Uh, Marge, I forgot my wallet.

11:33.843 --> 11:34.934
Hmm.

11:34.936 --> 11:36.027
No.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.938
No. Too edgy.
Too soft.

11:38.940 --> 11:40.273
What is this, Corden?

11:40.275 --> 11:41.257
Seen it.

11:41.259 --> 11:43.593
Not timely.
Too timely.

11:43.595 --> 11:45.019
Way too soft.

11:45.021 --> 11:46.705
What is this, Fallon?

11:46.707 --> 11:48.765
"Good luck Mom, we love you."

11:48.767 --> 11:50.024
I don't even get this.

11:50.026 --> 11:52.293
Is that all you got?

11:53.438 --> 11:54.713
Mm...

11:56.199 --> 11:59.625
(sighs) Guys, I know I've been
a little stressed lately,

11:59.627 --> 12:03.463
but it's so nice for us
to all sit down together.

12:03.465 --> 12:06.783
It's okay, Mom.
You're doing your dream job.

12:06.785 --> 12:08.375
Yeah, we're proud of you, Mom.

12:08.377 --> 12:09.894
Now pass the index cards.

12:09.896 --> 12:10.954
The what?

12:10.956 --> 12:12.956
I'm hungry for segments.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.791
Aah!

12:14.793 --> 12:16.793
What's the matter,
Marge?

12:16.795 --> 12:18.236
You haven't even touched

12:18.238 --> 12:21.030
your steamed pushpins.

12:22.968 --> 12:24.284
Aah!

12:25.394 --> 12:26.703
(gasps)

12:27.897 --> 12:29.289
(panting)

12:31.585 --> 12:33.126
(exclaims, gasps)

12:37.983 --> 12:39.832
(all grunting)

12:39.834 --> 12:41.667
Aah! Oh!

12:41.669 --> 12:44.179
Eh? (sighs)

12:46.933 --> 12:48.516
(cackling)

12:49.585 --> 12:51.019
Aah!

12:51.997 --> 12:53.605
-(sobbing)
-(whimpering)

12:53.607 --> 12:55.999
(growling)

12:56.001 --> 12:58.518
Mm. Mm...

12:58.520 --> 13:00.336
Look alive, people.
The big boss

13:00.338 --> 13:02.188
wants to see everyone
for a meeting.

13:02.190 --> 13:05.508
Krusty's here? But we don't tape
for another eight minutes.

13:05.510 --> 13:08.102
I just wanted to tell you
how grateful I am

13:08.104 --> 13:09.454
for all your hard work.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.456
I never knew
doing a television show

13:11.458 --> 13:14.459
could require so little effort
on my part.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.037
If anyone needs anything,
I'll be in my spray tan tent.

13:18.039 --> 13:20.632
Thanks, Krusty.
You earned it.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.526
Back to work. We need
50 branded segment ideas

13:23.528 --> 13:26.954
for Menopause Chapstick and
something called Cereal Wine.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.865
(all groan)

13:28.867 --> 13:31.534
At this solemn and holy moment,

13:31.536 --> 13:33.036
I baptize thee...

13:33.038 --> 13:35.796
(phone clicking, chiming)

13:35.798 --> 13:38.224
(grumbling)

13:38.226 --> 13:40.726
How are we supposed
to do surprise makeovers

13:40.728 --> 13:42.061
on the mailmen you brought in?

13:42.063 --> 13:44.063
Every one of them
is already gorgeous.

13:44.065 --> 13:45.990
ALL:
Shh!

13:45.992 --> 13:49.661
Special thanks to
the Pre-K Pop and Lock Crew.

13:49.663 --> 13:52.146
(cheering, applause)

13:52.148 --> 13:54.815
-That was great.
-It was fine.

13:54.817 --> 13:56.075
I mean, look me in the eye

13:56.077 --> 13:59.062
and tell me where the GIF was.
Tell me.

13:59.064 --> 14:01.840
Uh, uh, uh, when
the little kid breakdanced.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.341
Um, excuse me, Marge,

14:03.343 --> 14:06.344
there seems to be an emergency
at your house.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.180
What is so important
that you pulled me out of work?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.257
Marge, there's no emergency.

14:11.259 --> 14:13.759
Have a seat.
This is an intervention.

14:13.761 --> 14:15.595
-(gasps)
-(toilet flushes)

14:15.597 --> 14:18.690
I missed the big reveal?
You said I had time.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.433
Midge, go out and come back in.

14:20.435 --> 14:23.027
Aw, nah, forget that.
Who's that even for?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.955
All right, all right,
intervention. And, uh, go.

14:25.957 --> 14:28.091
If this is about
the melatonin gummies,

14:28.093 --> 14:30.259
I can stop whenever I want.

14:30.261 --> 14:31.761
No, Marge.
We're interventioning

14:31.763 --> 14:33.520
you and your whole deal.

14:33.522 --> 14:35.373
I never thought
I'd speak ill of TV,

14:35.375 --> 14:37.876
but I think it's destroying you.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.193
(grumbles)

14:39.195 --> 14:40.879
PATTY and SELMA:
Mm-hmm.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.381
Cut to commercial.

14:45.552 --> 14:49.295
Okay, let's make this quick.
Everybody say your little thing.

14:49.297 --> 14:51.372
We're just
worried about you, Marge.

14:51.374 --> 14:54.450
Look, even your best friend
Luann is here.

14:54.452 --> 14:55.894
Best friend?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.896
We haven't
had the conversation yet,

14:57.898 --> 14:59.898
but it's unspoken.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.125
Mom, we want to be supportive
of your dreams,

15:02.127 --> 15:05.128
but you just don't
seem to be enjoying it anymore.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.463
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.799
Sorry that
you're all so threatened

15:09.801 --> 15:11.817
by a powerful, successful woman.

15:11.819 --> 15:15.396
Lisa, as a feminist, you should
be ashamed of yourself.

15:15.398 --> 15:17.990
Really?
Just this week the show's done

15:17.992 --> 15:20.476
"sext your way
out of traffic school"

15:20.478 --> 15:24.238
and debuted a new daily segment
called "trends in cleavage."

15:24.240 --> 15:27.592
-When's this show on again?
-(phone dings)

15:27.594 --> 15:28.676
MARGE: Mm?

15:31.156 --> 15:34.490
The Internet's on fire
about our story

15:34.492 --> 15:37.251
exposing the toxic
work environment at<i> Krusty.</i>

15:37.253 --> 15:39.938
-Inexcusable.
-I heard they made
all the interns

15:39.940 --> 15:42.181
convert to Judaism
and work on Christmas,

15:42.183 --> 15:44.275
then convert back
and work on Passover.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.427
-(all gasp)
-Mm-hmm.

15:46.429 --> 15:48.279
(gasps)
This is a disaster.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.265
We can finish
this dumb thing later.

15:51.267 --> 15:54.619
Hmm. So, um,
what's the move here?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.696
Well, is there anything else
we can work on?

15:56.698 --> 15:57.830
Hey Homer, how's the drinking?

15:57.832 --> 15:59.348
Same.

15:59.350 --> 16:01.459
-(indistinct chatter)
-(whimpering)

16:07.025 --> 16:08.449
What the hell is this?

16:08.451 --> 16:11.527
For the first time in my life,
I'm not responsible

16:11.529 --> 16:15.047
for a toxic work environment.
I'm barely ever here.

16:15.049 --> 16:16.866
Physically,
and certainly not mentally.

16:16.868 --> 16:18.292
Don't worry, Krusty.

16:18.294 --> 16:21.037
I'm going to find whoever said
it's terrible to work here

16:21.039 --> 16:24.315
and personally bully them until
their hair falls out in clumps.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.560
But what you need now
is a redemption episode.

16:27.562 --> 16:30.154
And I know I speak
for the entire staff when I say

16:30.156 --> 16:32.991
we're willing to pull an
all-nighter to make it happen.

16:32.993 --> 16:35.326
(sobbing)

16:35.328 --> 16:36.995
Aah!

16:36.997 --> 16:39.497
Yeah, and you'll write me
one of those apologies

16:39.499 --> 16:41.390
where it sounds like I'm sorry
but I'm not actually

16:41.392 --> 16:43.559
taking the blame for anything?

16:43.561 --> 16:45.745
I've done hundreds of these.
It's actually a template

16:45.747 --> 16:47.422
in the software we use.

16:48.991 --> 16:50.341
Uh, what else?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.902
Bart, you got to be addicted
to something by now.

16:52.904 --> 16:54.420
None of your business.

16:54.422 --> 16:56.239
Fair enough.

16:56.241 --> 16:58.074

17:06.100 --> 17:08.417
I was devastated
to learn that our show

17:08.419 --> 17:11.195
has become
a toxic work environment.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.698
Well, even though
I knew absolutely nothing

17:13.700 --> 17:17.368
about what was going on,
the buck stops with me.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.097
And I promise you, I'm going
to take some time to listen,

17:21.099 --> 17:25.001
learn, not touch, and listen.

17:26.771 --> 17:29.121
What the hell is this?!

17:29.123 --> 17:31.107
How am I supposed
to do the salad shake

17:31.109 --> 17:33.626
if it's not
in its original container?

17:33.628 --> 17:35.053
-(grunts)
-Aah!

17:35.055 --> 17:37.388
(whimpering)

17:37.390 --> 17:39.223
Oh, my God.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.392
What have I become?

17:47.308 --> 17:50.459
I was completely unaware
of the following policies:

17:50.461 --> 17:52.070
if employees see me in my car,

17:52.072 --> 17:54.146
they must lower
imaginary sunglasses

17:54.148 --> 17:56.315
as if impressed and aroused.

17:56.317 --> 17:58.467
Krusty, you don't
need to do this.

17:58.469 --> 18:00.486
-The world
needs to know the truth.
-(phone rings)

18:00.488 --> 18:03.397
It's the system of daytime TV
that's toxic.

18:03.399 --> 18:05.416
It's turned us all into monsters

18:05.418 --> 18:07.159
fueled by stress, gaslighting,

18:07.161 --> 18:09.754
and $15 kale Caesar salads.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.239
The pressure to crank out
so much nice

18:12.241 --> 18:14.483
brings out the worst in us.

18:14.485 --> 18:17.670
We just wanted to bring
more nice in the world.

18:17.672 --> 18:19.764
More nice.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.824
Okay, new speech.

18:21.826 --> 18:23.159
This non-apology apology

18:23.161 --> 18:25.752
just became a real apology.

18:25.754 --> 18:26.920
This place isn't toxic

18:26.922 --> 18:29.464
because of whoever this lady is

18:29.466 --> 18:31.442
or "the system."

18:31.444 --> 18:34.019
-It's toxic because of me.
-(audience gasps)

18:34.021 --> 18:36.021
I'm a showbiz monster.

18:36.023 --> 18:37.931
I'm not nice.

18:37.933 --> 18:39.933
So I'm stepping away
from the show...

18:39.935 --> 18:41.619
forever.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.012
-(gasps)
-Wha?

18:43.014 --> 18:45.898
Krusty. Krusty,
you don't have to do this.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.366
It's not your fault.

18:47.368 --> 18:49.460
Look, lady, I couldn't
agree with you more.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.296
Everyone who works here
except me is nuts.

18:52.298 --> 18:55.299
I just quit because I closed
the deal for a new gig

18:55.301 --> 18:57.451
which makes
daytime talk show money

18:57.453 --> 18:59.786
look like late night
talk show money.

18:59.788 --> 19:01.973
TV judge syndication money.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.366
A judge?

19:03.368 --> 19:06.960
Judge Judy is the richest
TV star in the world.

19:06.962 --> 19:08.980
So I'm gonna be Judge Krusty.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.965
I can let my body go,
just sit on my keister

19:11.967 --> 19:14.301
and speak truth
to stupid all day.

19:14.303 --> 19:17.822
All right, I got to go
work on my humiliation quips.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.657
You ever do any bailiffing?

19:19.659 --> 19:20.658
Some.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.410
No more show?

19:23.979 --> 19:26.455
I'm... I'm free.

19:27.909 --> 19:29.909
Oh come on,
why would you do that?

19:29.911 --> 19:32.253
Sorry, Pat, sorry, sorry.

19:33.398 --> 19:34.821
<i> KRUSTY:</i>
<i> Oh, come on.</i>

19:34.823 --> 19:36.065
Don't sneeze on my robe

19:36.067 --> 19:38.083
and tell me I'm in a car wash.

19:38.085 --> 19:40.085
Did you fall out
of the stupid tree

19:40.087 --> 19:41.995
and land in the idiot mulch?

19:41.997 --> 19:43.830
His quips could use some work.

19:43.832 --> 19:45.424
(laughs)
Mulch.

19:45.426 --> 19:47.834
Do you ever miss
working in TV, Mom?

19:47.836 --> 19:51.080
There was at least a week there
where you seemed to enjoy it.

19:51.082 --> 19:53.507
Sure, it was
rewarding at first.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.693
But this experience
has made me realize

19:55.695 --> 19:59.922
my real dream job
is producing this family.

19:59.924 --> 20:01.348
And now, as a consultant,

20:01.350 --> 20:03.926
I get the best of both worlds.

20:03.928 --> 20:05.352
(phone rings)

20:05.354 --> 20:07.279
Marge, it's Drew.
I need your help.

20:07.281 --> 20:09.782
I got no A block for tomorrow.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.392
<i> Let me see...</i>

20:11.394 --> 20:13.211
<i>Have you seen the viral grandpa?</i>

20:13.213 --> 20:15.438
The one who raises baby ducks?

20:15.440 --> 20:19.291
Yes, I'm thinking
surprise spa day for him.

20:19.293 --> 20:21.719
And an extreme pond makeover
for the ducks.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.130
Oh, Marge, are you sure
you won't come work for me?

20:25.132 --> 20:26.873
That's very sweet, Drew,

20:26.875 --> 20:29.227
but my daytime days are over.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.145
-(kids grunting, coughing)
-(sobbing)

20:31.898 --> 20:33.981
Oh...

20:35.126 --> 20:36.550
I'll be in touch.

The audience.

21:15.683 --> 21:17.166
I'm warming up the audience.

21:17.168 --> 21:18.985
It's all on the teleprompter!

21:19.854 --> 21:21.261
Why don't you just put this on

21:21.263 --> 21:22.855
for a "who wore it best"
segment?

21:22.857 --> 21:25.658
Mm! (chuckles)

Shh!
