be a lot of those, are there?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.774

10:07.774 --> 10:09.484

10:09.484 --> 10:11.778

table and have a snack?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.203
(scary voice):
It could be your last!

10:24.207 --> 10:26.459
Maybe you'll enjoy
some "finger" food.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.256
If you're not that hungry,

10:31.256 --> 10:32.215

10:33.800 --> 10:36.469

10:36.469 --> 10:39.222

This dip's delicious.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.999
Now, let's move
to our main event.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.544
I spent all afternoon writing

11:09.544 --> 11:10.879
a complicated murder mystery,

11:10.879 --> 11:12.297
and hiding clues

11:12.297 --> 11:14.090
all over the house.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.259

out who the killer is.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.803

11:19.179 --> 11:21.264

that I have created

11:21.264 --> 11:22.640
for you guys to play.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.225
Ooh!

11:24.225 --> 11:26.186
I am the rich victim's nurse

11:26.186 --> 11:28.104
with ulterior motives,

11:28.104 --> 11:31.065
who found him lying facedown
in the swimming pool.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.943
And I'm the victim's
mother who seems nice,

11:33.943 --> 11:37.447
but has a deep, dark secret
hidden just beneath the surface!

11:37.447 --> 11:39.073
And I'm the murderer!

11:39.073 --> 11:40.658
Sydney/Sophia/Olive:

mean to blurt it.

You know that about me.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.798
‐So, what do we do now?
‐Board games?

11:55.798 --> 11:57.634
They're not very Halloweeny.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.469
‐Scary movie?
‐Then, I'm out.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.180

gonna say it.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.354
I would've enjoyed it more.

12:09.938 --> 12:13.191
Yeah. It's like we never
got a chance to say goodbye.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.526
Well, you can't say
hello to the future

12:15.526 --> 12:17.862
unless you say
goodbye to the past.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.921
It's bad enough we got
