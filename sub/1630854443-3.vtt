Max: The Sisters
Of The Holy Tears Convent

00:56.389 --> 00:58.516
had taken in Archie's mother
when she was orphaned

00:58.558 --> 01:01.728
and Archie always felt
a great affinity for them.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.730
So after the Loswaki massacre,

01:03.772 --> 01:06.232
he thought it would be
an interesting and safe subject

01:06.274 --> 01:07.442
for Alba to tackle.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.444
- The nuns were a hoot.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.237
For every natural event,

01:11.279 --> 01:13.365
there was a supernatural
interpretation.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.700
If a butterfly
flew in the window,

01:15.742 --> 01:20.205
they'd declare
"A letter will arrive today."

01:20.246 --> 01:22.374
If milk boiled over
on the stove,

01:22.415 --> 01:24.292
they'd say, "We must be careful,

01:24.334 --> 01:27.170
someone
in the sisterhood is sick."

01:27.212 --> 01:31.758
They all played the lottery
a lot, but never won.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.594
-And they insisted on traveling
without anyone else,

01:34.636 --> 01:36.554
always, didn't they?

01:36.596 --> 01:40.225
- Yes, they made me drive my car
behind their bus.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.644
- The, uh, the weather
for the day of the field trip

01:42.686 --> 01:45.730

Max: After the accident,
Alba lost track of time.

01:58.284 --> 02:00.203
She felt hollow.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.371
She grew tired.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.790
She would gaze
at the birds in the ocean

02:03.832 --> 02:06.668
and felt deeply moved by
the life humming inside them.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.215
Alba: I dropped my guard.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.634
I knew there were
magical moments to cling to

02:14.676 --> 02:17.387
and I felt alert
towards the things around me,

02:17.429 --> 02:19.305
especially the birds.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.600
But it's as if someone
got inside my body at night,

02:22.642 --> 02:24.227
not sexually, but like,

02:24.269 --> 02:27.230
a scientist got in there
and rewired all my parts

back in the right place.

[Glass clatters]

02:33.695 --> 02:35.488
Maybe less of a scientist

of a Mexican electrician,

02:38.324 --> 02:39.784

to improvising.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.330

I could see
the difference right away.

02:47.709 --> 02:50.670
After three days,
the evidence was undeniable.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.674
I had started losing luminosity.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.598
I would lie out in the sun
trying to soak in nature,

03:01.639 --> 03:03.516
but I was fading fast.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.730

I was a bit astonished

[Chair slides]

13:52.165 --> 13:53.583
- What is it?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.585
- I took a pinch to my village.

13:55.627 --> 13:58.380
I showed it to my uncle Ulises,
he's a pharmacist.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.591
He knows everything
about chemicals and poisons.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.260
He told me this comes
from a Japanese fish

14:04.302 --> 14:06.096
that rich people
pay a lot of money

14:06.137 --> 14:07.305
to eat in restaurants,

14:07.347 --> 14:10.183
but if it goes
into your bloodstream

14:10.225 --> 14:12.435
a certain way,

14:12.477 --> 14:14.562
it paralyzes you.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.564
- You think he's poisoning her?

14:16.606 --> 14:19.150
- I think she is poisoning him.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.154
Alba: What?
Inosencia: Hmm.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.615
I saw it two weeks ago,
with my very own eyes.

in my dreams.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.003
She's in danger.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.464
- Maybe your dream
is an inverse prediction.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.341
It happens.

Tell me about your visitor.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.477
- What visitor?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.229
- Let me explain to you
something about me

16:19.270 --> 16:21.231
that you may not
have figured out.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.274
I hate thieves and I hate liars.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.151

16:25.193 --> 16:27.487
You know, that reminds me
of what Doña Leticia

16:27.529 --> 16:29.531
- was telling to her daughter...
- You don't understand.

16:31.366 --> 16:32.492
- What?

16:32.534 --> 16:34.452
- It must be a drag,
living on scraps,

16:34.494 --> 16:36.496
on whatever
the hot shots let fall.

16:36.538 --> 16:39.082

16:43.378 --> 16:45.505
- Have I done something
to upset you?

16:45.547 --> 16:46.840
- As I was saying,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.258
living in self-respecting
poverty is insulting,

16:48.299 --> 16:49.592
no matter how you slice it.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.511
But see,
I think life must be lived

16:51.553 --> 16:53.388
according to your own terms.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.558
Otherwise, it is my belief,
it's not worth living at all.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.060
What are you drinking?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.357
- Tea.

17:04.399 --> 17:06.693
- May I have a sip?

17:06.735 --> 17:09.362
- You won't like it,
it's gone cold.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.239
But I can make you a new one.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.324

Inocencia.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.659
-Mm-hm.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.327
- I know you don't like me
and I have a few reasons

17:16.369 --> 17:17.829
not to trust
you a hundred percent.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.372
And you've worked
for Archie since forever,

17:19.414 --> 17:21.458
but I think it's time
for you to move on.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.585
- Is this some kind of game?
- Yes.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.212
It's called
"stop lying to my face."

17:26.254 --> 17:28.131
I know Alba was here
visiting you today.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.341
- No, not today.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.176
- Oh, not today, but other days?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.219
How often does she swing by?

17:33.261 --> 17:35.722

17:35.764 --> 17:37.599
- But not today.
- No.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.101
- You swear to God.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.188
- I don't take
the Lord's name in vain. No.

17:43.229 --> 17:47.317
- So I'm just being paranoid,
is that it?

17:47.359 --> 17:48.693
- I didn't say that,

17:48.735 --> 17:51.571
but, um, you've been acting
a little nervous lately.

17:51.613 --> 17:55.325
You know, like what you said
about the coconuts this morning.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.744
- Oh, please.
I said I was wondering

17:57.786 --> 17:59.454
if other people
were also paranoid

17:59.496 --> 18:01.164
about coconuts
falling on their heads.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.415
This is something
completely different,

18:02.457 --> 18:03.583
and you know that!

18:03.625 --> 18:05.126

I'm sorry. You can't just...

18:14.803 --> 18:17.305

what I can and cannot do with

18:17.347 --> 18:18.473
my own staff?

18:20.684 --> 18:22.477
- No.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.354
- My staff who steals
my husband's gold watches

18:24.396 --> 18:27.148
and rings and my jewelry
when she thinks I'm not looking?

18:29.317 --> 18:32.362
- I have never stolen anything
in my entire life.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.533

- I heard about your loss.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.405
- Can you please not...?

22:46.658 --> 22:47.951
- When you make a documentary,

22:47.992 --> 22:50.578
the main question is
where to put the camera.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.871
Choose correctly,

22:51.913 --> 22:53.748
the subject will reveal
itself organically

22:53.790 --> 22:56.876

22:58.837 --> 23:02.424
there is no overestimating
good luck.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.895

my deepest condolences.

with the mud already?

23:25.613 --> 23:26.865
What is this?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.033
- It's a movie.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.744
A documentary filmed
from two angles.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.537

23:32.579 --> 23:34.956
poisoning Archie's Negroni
three different times

23:34.998 --> 23:37.042
until you got the amount
just right, but then...

23:37.083 --> 23:40.795
And this is where the stroke
of luck comes in.

23:40.837 --> 23:43.089
Right there on the edge
of the gazebo,

23:43.131 --> 23:46.926
looking at the pool,
exactly where he collapses

23:46.968 --> 23:49.012
once the poison surges
through his veins

23:49.054 --> 23:50.680
into his heart.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.098
It remains on this fixed-line,

23:52.140 --> 23:54.642
exactly where you dragged him
to the wheelbarrow

23:54.684 --> 23:56.686
and wheeled him
down to the shore,

23:56.728 --> 23:59.064
where you dumped him.

But it's all there.

24:04.652 --> 24:08.073
It shows how much effort
it took you to strip him naked.

24:08.114 --> 24:11.117
Then without a doubt,
the most surprising moment

24:11.159 --> 24:13.119
was when you're about
to position him face down

24:13.161 --> 24:14.621
so he'll drown

24:14.662 --> 24:15.872
and you notice his erection

24:15.914 --> 24:18.917
and you can't resist
kissing it goodbye

24:18.958 --> 24:22.796
with such vigorous tenderness.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.799
In that unguarded moment,
I understood you.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.011
Love is rare
because it rarely happens

24:30.053 --> 24:32.597
but some part of you,

24:32.639 --> 24:37.060
the deepest animal
part of you, loved him.

24:37.102 --> 24:39.020
He came and went
in his final moment.

24:40.689 --> 24:42.816
- What...?

24:42.857 --> 24:45.694

in my lawyer's office,

25:07.132 --> 25:09.217
of course, with instructions,

25:09.259 --> 25:12.262
should I suddenly disappear.

25:12.303 --> 25:14.222
I imagine
the Mexican Justice System

25:14.264 --> 25:16.224
will throw every law
and every book

25:16.266 --> 25:17.976
they ever read at you.

25:18.018 --> 25:20.103

25:27.277 --> 25:29.112
