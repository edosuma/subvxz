00:02.430 --> 00:03.429
Who are they?

00:03.430 --> 00:06.128
Lucien: The lord Tristan
and his sister the lady Aurora.

00:06.129 --> 00:08.679
Lucien, what are you
really doing in my city?

00:08.680 --> 00:10.771
The life of every vampire
is linked back

00:10.772 --> 00:12.724
to the Original
who begat the line.

00:12.725 --> 00:15.108
Kill an Original,
wipe out an entire line.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.644
If you want to know what I do

00:16.645 --> 00:17.928
about the dangers
you now face,

00:17.929 --> 00:20.063
there is something
that you must see.

00:20.065 --> 00:21.932
You have a warning
to deliver, luv.

00:21.933 --> 00:23.151
Best get on with it.

00:23.152 --> 00:25.269
Freya: His prophesy
is fulfilled.

00:25.270 --> 00:27.621
You will all fall...
One by friend,

00:27.623 --> 00:30.625
one by foe,
and one by family.

00:30.626 --> 00:31.626
I'm Aya.

00:31.627 --> 00:32.827
I was instructed not to leave

00:32.828 --> 00:34.379
without making you an offer.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.463
I don't have time for this.
Get her out of here.

00:37.615 --> 00:39.751
Let us help you
return New Orleans

00:39.752 --> 00:42.170
to what it should be
with you as its king.

00:42.171 --> 00:43.287
Who's us?

00:43.288 --> 00:44.839
We are called The Strix.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.457
Tristan:
Let her go, Elijah.

00:46.458 --> 00:47.759
Elijah: Tristan.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.844
Marcellus, you would
do well to be selective

00:49.845 --> 00:53.063

you keep in future.

02:06.221 --> 02:07.705
You want to dress me up
in nice clothes,

02:07.706 --> 02:09.372
all you had to do was ask.

02:09.374 --> 02:13.060
I'll keep that in mind
in the future, Mr. Gerard.

02:13.061 --> 02:14.896
Thought you
were someone else.

02:14.897 --> 02:16.430
Perhaps my associate Aya.

02:16.431 --> 02:18.432
Clearly, she made
quite an impression.

02:18.433 --> 02:20.601
She is an exquisite beauty,

02:20.602 --> 02:22.937
and, in fairness,
the violence was my idea.

02:22.938 --> 02:24.238
Had you simply
come willingly,

02:24.239 --> 02:26.072
none of that would
have been necessary.

02:26.074 --> 02:29.694
So this is your version of
asking me something nicely.

02:29.695 --> 02:31.061
It's an invitation.

02:31.062 --> 02:33.414
I believe Aya told you
a bit about The Strix...

02:33.415 --> 02:35.449
Who we are, what
we're capable of.

02:35.450 --> 02:38.119
Every few years,
we gather to celebrate

02:38.120 --> 02:40.421
our status as the most
elite creatures

02:40.422 --> 02:42.957
in the world,
and in the rare instance

02:42.958 --> 02:44.625
we feel we've identified
someone worthy

02:44.626 --> 02:47.094
of our attention,
we open our doors.

02:47.095 --> 02:50.014
What makes you so sure
I'm interested in you?

02:50.015 --> 02:52.249
You haven't hung up
the phone yet.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.551
I understand you
fostered quite

02:53.552 --> 02:55.920
a community here
in New Orleans.

02:55.921 --> 02:58.472
We can offer you
a global network...

02:58.473 --> 03:00.858
Resources, access, power.

03:00.859 --> 03:02.610
You're a born leader, Marcel.

03:02.611 --> 03:04.896
Why stop at just one city?

03:04.897 --> 03:07.096
Maybe I'm happy
with what I've got.

03:07.098 --> 03:09.367
Somehow I doubt that,

03:09.368 --> 03:12.403
but if I've failed
to pique your interest,

03:12.404 --> 03:15.072
by all means,
disregard this call.

03:15.073 --> 03:17.107
If, on the other
hand, you feel you'd

03:17.108 --> 03:20.127
be a worthy addition
to our ranks,

03:20.128 --> 03:24.114
join us tonight

something the matter, Elijah?

03:46.104 --> 03:47.805
There something
that you want to talk about,

03:47.806 --> 03:51.025
like The Strix?

can come, old chum,"

I was picking up hope

03:58.617 --> 04:00.868
when some random vampire
dropped it off.

04:00.869 --> 04:03.287
You care to fill me in?

04:03.288 --> 04:04.872
This isn't your concern.

04:04.873 --> 04:06.958
Oh, but it is,

04:06.959 --> 04:09.293
so why don't you cut
the protective macho crap

04:09.294 --> 04:11.379
and tell me what's
really going on?

04:11.380 --> 04:13.163
I'm part of this
family, too, Elijah.

04:13.164 --> 04:15.164
I thought you, of all people,
would act like it.

04:16.834 --> 04:19.386
So what do you want to know?

04:24.675 --> 04:28.112
What are you doing here?

you were back

04:32.818 --> 04:35.519
from wherever it is
you go to when you leave.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.022
Perhaps I was thrown off
by the lack of strange

gentleman callers
perusing the contents

04:39.908 --> 04:41.993

this morning.

04:41.994 --> 04:43.911
Your concern
for my whereabouts

04:43.912 --> 04:45.496
is touching.

04:45.497 --> 04:48.465
I simply want to know
who is here at any give moment.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.718
I hardly think that's
too much to ask.

04:50.719 --> 04:53.254
Hayley: Well, as long
as we're taking attendance...

04:53.255 --> 04:55.256
Oh, good.
It's my not-so-loving elder brother

04:55.257 --> 04:56.757
and my former
one-night stand.

04:56.758 --> 04:59.043

family gathering.

Charming.

05:00.345 --> 05:01.929
Elijah was just
catching me up

05:01.930 --> 05:03.597
on how you have no clue
which one of you long-lost buddies

05:03.598 --> 05:06.050
you can trust and which one
is trying to kill you.

05:06.051 --> 05:07.652
Well, clearly what
the situation needs

05:07.653 --> 05:09.103
is more opinions.

05:09.104 --> 05:11.188
I assume you told her
about the blood prophesy.

05:11.189 --> 05:12.857
I was just getting to that.

my old mate Lucien

05:15.610 --> 05:17.244
has acquired a genuine seer,

05:17.245 --> 05:18.946
and in an effort to prove
his good intentions,

05:18.947 --> 05:20.748
he got her to show us
some rather dire visions

05:20.749 --> 05:22.083
of future doom.

05:22.084 --> 05:23.400
It's grim stuff, really,

we talking about?

get your wish.

I will be one step ahead.

25:13.982 --> 25:15.582
Since the moment
you walked in,

25:15.583 --> 25:17.701
I've seen a thousand ends

25:17.702 --> 25:20.454
to this little confrontation,

25:20.455 --> 25:24.842
none of them
very favorable for you.

25:24.843 --> 25:27.326
You're a Mikaelson.

25:38.105 --> 25:40.190
[Gasps]

25:40.191 --> 25:42.810
The family blood
you sought to find

25:42.811 --> 25:46.847
shall be what lays
you low in kind.

25:46.848 --> 25:49.349
Poor girl.

25:49.350 --> 25:52.619
You searched a thousand
years for family,

25:52.620 --> 25:55.205
and in finding them,

25:55.206 --> 25:58.525
they will be your undoing.

25:58.526 --> 26:02.578
Either you're right
or you're wrong,

26:02.580 --> 26:06.750
although you do make
one good point.

26:06.751 --> 26:09.535
I am a Mikaelson.

26:11.950 --> 26:14.707
I'm sorry.
Please excuse me.

26:19.763 --> 26:21.714
You should, uh, move along.

26:21.716 --> 26:23.484
You're not welcome here.

26:23.485 --> 26:26.053
Oh, oh, ok. We're...
We're not welcome here...

26:26.054 --> 26:28.022
Ha ha ha!...

26:28.023 --> 26:30.858
Or maybe you
should move along

26:30.859 --> 26:33.777
before I make you cry in front
of all your little friends.

26:33.778 --> 26:35.412
Ha ha!

26:35.413 --> 26:37.564
My concern is for
your companions.

26:37.565 --> 26:40.918
They appear out of sorts without
a shiny pole to ride upon.

26:40.919 --> 26:44.621
Lucien: Oh, he's suggesting
that you're exotic dancers,

26:44.622 --> 26:46.590
which, to him, is an insult

26:46.591 --> 26:48.675
if not somewhat hypocritical,

26:48.676 --> 26:50.377
but don't take it
personally, luv.

26:50.378 --> 26:52.379
He finds all work demeaning.

26:52.380 --> 26:54.465
The only dignified way
to accumulate wealth

26:54.466 --> 26:55.849
is by birth.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.351
Boop!

26:57.352 --> 26:59.252
Isn't the right,
Tristan, hmm?

26:59.253 --> 27:02.271
Elijah: Niklaus.
What is it?

27:03.474 --> 27:04.525
Oh.

27:04.526 --> 27:06.426
You're hammered,

27:06.427 --> 27:07.945
which should come
as very little surprise

27:07.946 --> 27:10.614
to anyone here, but it does

27:10.615 --> 27:13.433
hamper the festivities
somewhat, so could I

27:13.434 --> 27:15.735
recommend that you...

27:15.737 --> 27:17.938
You find the nearest
exit and...

27:17.939 --> 27:19.406
Just...
Yes,

27:19.407 --> 27:22.825
and could you take
your playthings with you, too?

27:26.279 --> 27:28.280
[Sniffles]

27:32.136 --> 27:35.255
You know, I used
to find it insulting

27:35.256 --> 27:38.257
that I was barred from
your special, little club,

27:38.259 --> 27:40.978
but now I realize
I lack the flexibility

27:40.979 --> 27:43.296
to become a member.

27:43.297 --> 27:45.849
I could never get
my head far enough

27:45.850 --> 27:47.801
up my own ass.

27:47.802 --> 27:50.069
[Laughter]

27:55.742 --> 27:57.744
Ahh...

27:57.745 --> 28:00.080
Cheap.

28:00.081 --> 28:02.082
Come on. Let's go.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.333
This party's dead, anyway.

28:04.335 --> 28:06.920
Ha ha ha!

28:06.921 --> 28:10.673
[Howls]

28:21.371 --> 28:24.103
If you'd please come
with us, Mr. Gerard...

28:53.361 --> 28:56.420
Mr. Gerard, it's time.

28:56.421 --> 28:58.422
You're pushing up the clock.

28:58.423 --> 28:59.890
I have another hour.

28:59.891 --> 29:01.875
And I'm afraid
that an inability to improvise

29:01.876 --> 29:04.094
is the most common
of failings.

29:04.095 --> 29:06.729
Either you have an answer
or you don't.

29:17.241 --> 29:19.610
Aya.

29:19.611 --> 29:21.778
Aya took my ring.

29:21.779 --> 29:25.415
Then I am impressed.

29:25.416 --> 29:27.750
Intense guy.

29:27.752 --> 29:29.453
I'm sorry,
but I don't have your...

29:29.454 --> 29:31.088
Hold off.
I said you took it.

29:31.089 --> 29:33.090
I didn't say
you still have it.

29:33.091 --> 29:35.424
See, after you
lifted it off me...

29:37.044 --> 29:39.845
You gave it to my man
Mohinder over there.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.683
Marcel: What are
they doing here?

29:45.914 --> 29:48.305
Tristan: Well done.

29:48.306 --> 29:49.723
Of course, as you know,

29:49.724 --> 29:52.775
that was only
half the challenge.

30:00.701 --> 30:02.602
Let's see how he does.

30:02.603 --> 30:04.321
There's no shame in dying

30:04.322 --> 30:06.290
at the hands
of one's superior.

30:06.291 --> 30:09.125
There's not much
glory in it, either.

30:33.952 --> 30:35.403
Uhh!

30:37.322 --> 30:38.407
Huh!
Uh!

30:38.408 --> 30:40.242
Yaagh!

30:40.243 --> 30:41.909
Uh...

30:58.560 --> 30:59.727
Yaagh!

31:23.168 --> 31:24.919
Hrraagh!

31:30.842 --> 31:32.576
Aagh!

31:34.429 --> 31:36.764
[Panting]

31:39.050 --> 31:40.768
You fought with honor.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.636
Embrace the nobility
of this end.

31:42.638 --> 31:44.723
I will if you will,

31:44.724 --> 31:47.142
or do you still not know?

31:47.143 --> 31:50.312
You must have tasted it
in my blood.

31:50.313 --> 31:53.148
Oh, now you're starting
to feel it, aren't you,

31:53.149 --> 31:56.651
that burning sensation
in your gut...

31:56.652 --> 31:58.402
Wolf's venom,

31:58.404 --> 32:00.438
a going-away gift
from me.

32:00.439 --> 32:03.441
I may not have beaten you,
but you lost all the same.

32:03.442 --> 32:05.609
I suggest you
make your peace.

32:05.611 --> 32:07.963
We're both dead men walking.

32:07.964 --> 32:11.298
Mohinder:
A desperate ploy, a lie!

32:16.638 --> 32:18.790
You know, I used
to find it insulting

32:18.791 --> 32:21.643
that I was barred from
your special, little club,

32:21.644 --> 32:23.344
but now I realize...

32:25.730 --> 32:28.183
I don't know why
they want you dead,

32:28.184 --> 32:30.769
but clearly they do.

32:30.770 --> 32:34.189
Why else tell me all about
his little feeding habits

32:34.190 --> 32:36.074
or give me a taste
of his technique when you came

32:36.075 --> 32:38.142
into my gym the other day?

32:38.143 --> 32:42.147
All I had to do
was be observant,

32:42.148 --> 32:45.867
but I'm done
picking up your bread crumbs.

32:45.868 --> 32:49.504
You want him dead, you're gonna
have to do it yourself.

32:49.505 --> 32:52.674
As far as I can see, the only
thing he's done to deserve it

32:52.675 --> 32:55.659
is picking his friends
poorly.

33:03.635 --> 33:06.387
Uh...
Uh...

33:24.188 --> 33:25.355
[Gasps]

33:27.909 --> 33:29.192
[Thud]

33:30.912 --> 33:32.196
[Splat]

33:32.197 --> 33:34.748
You chose well.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.837
Now, I assure you,
he did deserve it.

33:38.838 --> 33:40.722
He's been plotting
unspeakable crimes

33:40.723 --> 33:43.058
against his sworn
brothers and sisters.

33:43.059 --> 33:45.510
Of course, you
couldn't have known.

33:45.511 --> 33:48.730
Beating such a worthy
opponent is proof

33:48.731 --> 33:51.933
of your strength and courage,

33:51.934 --> 33:54.019
but your restraint,
your refusal to kill

33:54.020 --> 33:57.939
without cause demonstrates
a rare integrity.

33:57.940 --> 34:02.225
You see, Marcel Gerard,
this was the test.

34:10.902 --> 34:12.670
Welcome to The Strix...

34:15.623 --> 34:17.408
Provided, of course,

34:17.409 --> 34:20.260
you survive your own gambit.

34:26.051 --> 34:30.021
Klaus: I bet they were all
so impressed,

34:30.022 --> 34:35.143
weren't they, hmm,
your new mates,

34:35.143 --> 34:37.929
positively taken
by your boldness,

34:37.929 --> 34:41.264
your cunning wit,
and your steely resolve,

34:41.266 --> 34:43.902
and you just assumed
that I would be

34:43.902 --> 34:46.821
willing...
Eager, even...

34:46.822 --> 34:51.625
To drain the blood from
my veins in the aftermath.

34:54.129 --> 34:56.998
We cannot tell
friend from foe,

34:56.998 --> 34:58.550
and what are you doing?

34:58.551 --> 35:00.135
You're pledging a fraternity

35:00.136 --> 35:03.955
run by those
conspiring against us.

35:03.956 --> 35:08.226
My interest in The Strix
is because of you.

35:08.227 --> 35:11.129
I don't get to choose sides.

35:11.130 --> 35:14.933
Whoever comes for you
comes for me.

35:14.934 --> 35:17.351
That's all I need to know.

35:21.990 --> 35:24.908
She's awake.

35:32.316 --> 35:34.669
Yes. Whoever
comes for me

35:34.670 --> 35:36.987
may very well come for you...

35:48.683 --> 35:53.103
But they may also come
through you, Marcellus.

35:57.692 --> 36:00.861
Remember that.

36:03.982 --> 36:06.568
I'm sorry.

36:06.569 --> 36:09.237
I hoped I was wrong,
Lucien... I really did...

36:09.238 --> 36:11.739
But I saw it.

36:17.245 --> 36:19.747
I saw him die.

36:23.034 --> 36:25.536
Did you see the weapon?

36:25.537 --> 36:28.006
What is it?

36:28.007 --> 36:31.708
To understand,
it must be seen.

37:07.762 --> 37:09.848
[Coughing]

37:09.849 --> 37:11.182
Something's wrong.

37:11.183 --> 37:12.933
It's poison.

37:14.969 --> 37:17.721
[Coughing]

37:19.307 --> 37:21.259
No. No. No. No.

37:21.260 --> 37:22.977
No. No. No.

37:22.978 --> 37:25.313
No!

37:25.314 --> 37:26.763
No.

37:47.528 --> 37:49.230
Marcel: So...

37:49.231 --> 37:50.681
When do I learn
the secret handshake?

37:50.682 --> 37:53.050
Wait. Do you guys
know who killed JFK?

37:53.051 --> 37:56.387
Patience.
All in time.

37:56.388 --> 37:58.389
What would you have done

37:58.390 --> 38:00.540
if I didn't figure it out?

38:05.179 --> 38:07.481
Compelled someone to
clean up your burning husk,

38:07.482 --> 38:10.533
never thought of you again.

38:24.748 --> 38:26.667
Tristan: Of course
it was Lucien.

38:26.668 --> 38:28.201
I have to give him credit.

38:28.202 --> 38:29.502
It's quite the stroke
of genius.

38:29.504 --> 38:31.387
The entirety of his
claims against me

38:31.389 --> 38:33.307
rest on these visions.

38:33.308 --> 38:35.042
His promise that they'd
become more specific

38:35.043 --> 38:37.845
was necessary
but impractical.

38:37.846 --> 38:42.766
Details can be verified,
cross-examined, debunked.

38:42.767 --> 38:45.853
The longer his allegations
remain vague,

38:45.854 --> 38:47.387
the less credible
they become,

38:47.388 --> 38:49.222
so removing them entirely

38:49.223 --> 38:52.391
was actually the only
move left to make.

39:02.253 --> 39:06.907
Your words are no more
compelling than his.

39:06.908 --> 39:09.676
I want proof.

39:46.130 --> 39:49.332
I finally got her to sleep.

39:52.720 --> 39:56.140
I'll have to explain
this family to hope someday.

39:56.141 --> 40:00.627
I think about that sometimes.

40:00.628 --> 40:02.979
Elijah:
What do you think?

40:05.516 --> 40:08.152
Hayley: I wouldn't
lie to her.

40:08.153 --> 40:11.688
I'll never lie to her...

40:13.524 --> 40:16.192
But you know what
I'll start with?

40:18.412 --> 40:21.864
"Always and forever."

40:34.845 --> 40:37.297
I'm sorry. I...

40:37.298 --> 40:40.634
I should've told you
what was happening.

40:40.635 --> 40:44.555
You made him, right, Tristan?

40:44.556 --> 40:47.024
Think it would be
more accurate to say

40:47.025 --> 40:49.443
that we made each
other, but, yes,

40:49.444 --> 40:52.396
I turned him.

40:52.397 --> 40:54.865
What was your impression

40:54.866 --> 40:57.868
of Tristan de Martel?

40:57.869 --> 40:59.519
I don't know.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.521
He seemed...

41:01.522 --> 41:03.873
Incomplete.

41:07.995 --> 41:11.914
He has a sister...
Aurora.

41:17.171 --> 41:19.173
Elijah: To be perfectly
frank with you,

41:19.174 --> 41:20.540
I'm surprised
that he's without her.

41:20.541 --> 41:23.092
His devotion to her is
absolutely pathological.

41:26.146 --> 41:27.815
It's dangerous.

41:27.816 --> 41:31.601
Loyalty doesn't make
people dangerous, Elijah.

41:40.227 --> 41:41.778
Mm-hmm.

41:46.617 --> 41:47.667
Hmm.
