(sighs)

00:04.005 --> 00:06.305
Why are you putting spoons
in the laundry hamper?

00:06.307 --> 00:07.806
I'm hiding our nice stuff.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.842
See, my cousin Bobby and Carol
are coming in town,

00:09.844 --> 00:11.710
and they're gonna ask me
for money, so I'm...

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
I'm trying my hardest
to look poor.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.346
You are poor.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.614
Technically, yes, but I'm also

00:15.616 --> 00:17.983
the richest Miller
in the history of our family.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.486
I mean, I own part of a bar,
I have a savings account.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.022
I don't fully understand
how to use it, but I do have it.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.390
Nick, you're doing great;
you really been

00:24.392 --> 00:25.624
stepping it up lately.
Calm down.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.192
Thanks. The other day...

00:27.194 --> 00:29.328
The other day, I was
at a restaurant, and they asked

00:29.330 --> 00:31.130
if I wanted avocado, and...
and I said, "Yeah."

00:31.132 --> 00:33.298
And they said, "It's extra,"
and I go, "Shh.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.035
I know it's extra,
but... but I want it."

00:36.737 --> 00:38.137
Uh, Winston,
you ready to go?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.304
Born ready!

00:39.306 --> 00:41.407
You know, believe it
or not, you guys,

00:41.409 --> 00:43.675
I have never been
wedding dress shopping before,

00:43.677 --> 00:45.577
so I didn't really
know what to pack.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.980
Are those whistles?
Yeah. These are whistles.

00:47.982 --> 00:50.883
Oh, I even got a pocket fan
so I can blow wind in your face,

00:50.885 --> 00:52.384
and your hair could be
all like this.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.752
Pocket fan.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.521
Cece, I'm begging you,
just cancel the appointment

00:55.523 --> 00:57.256
and reschedule it
for when Jess comes back.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.191
There is a six-month
waiting list.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.693
Do you not want us
to get married in June?

01:01.695 --> 01:03.095
Oh, no, I want
to get married in August,

01:03.097 --> 01:04.663
so I can walk down the aisle
covered in flies.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.165
You're so concerned
about these flies.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.333
Please, go to the appointment.
Look, relax.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.002
All right?
Nick is the best man,

01:10.004 --> 01:12.037
Jess is the maid of honor,
and myself personally,

01:12.039 --> 01:13.572
this is where I cut loose.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.507
This is where you unleash
the beast, all right?

01:15.509 --> 01:18.043
Speaking of which, uh, Cece, did
you bring your strapless bra,

01:18.045 --> 01:20.546
or should I get the booby tape?
Booby tape.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.014
CECE: Uh, no, Winston,
this is just a ride.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.382
It is just a ride, okay?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.384
Hey, guys, C-Cece,
my cousins are almost coming!

01:25.386 --> 01:27.219
Cece, hide your jewelry!
Winston, hide your jewelry!

01:27.221 --> 01:28.454
All the jewelry!

01:28.456 --> 01:30.355
Nick, this is insane.

01:30.357 --> 01:32.224
Just tell your family that
you can't give them any money.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.358
Set some boundaries.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.627
You're right.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.362
Time for me to
put my foot down.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.797
Put it down.
I'm gonna say no.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.065
Yes.
I'm gonna set boundaries.

01:40.067 --> 01:41.600
No money for them.

I don't do yoga.

carpet down over the hardwood?

by five different bees

07:08.395 --> 07:09.861
five days in a row.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.563
What were you doing

07:11.565 --> 07:15.967
that your naked penis
was exposed to bumblebees?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.235
Why is he here?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.804
You know, even though
I don't approve of this,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.806
I would never, ever leave you
in your time of need.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.207
Schmidt, I don't
want you here.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.575
I told him I didn't
want him here.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.110
I can't be any more
clear on that.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.280
I botched it!

07:28.282 --> 07:29.815
Botched it good! Three
strikes, and you're out!

07:29.817 --> 07:31.817
How do you botch it?

07:31.819 --> 07:33.051
You do not have my blessing.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.119
I don't need
your blessing.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.487
I don't want it.
I don't care.

07:35.489 --> 07:36.721
I don't even
want you here.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.123
NURSE: Mr. Miller,
we're ready for you.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.225
Thank you so much.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.493
Here I go.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.727
Nicky, give 'em hell, huh?
Yeah.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.095
Get me a winner. All right?
You got it.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.797
CAROL: All right. All right.
Go get 'em, Nicky.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.066
We believe in you.
Come on, make a smart one.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.135
Here we go!
BOBBY: Yeah!

07:55.342 --> 07:57.309
Hey, Schmidt, can I have a...
So you do need my blessing!

07:57.311 --> 07:59.277
I don't need you! Just please
come back in here with me.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.445
Thank you.

08:00.447 --> 08:03.315
Never seen two guys
so close like that, you know.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.816
My dad and his...

08:04.818 --> 08:07.352
and his friend Joe
were close like that.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.920
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.255
Well, you got in my head.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.857
You got in my head.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.692
Why'd you have to tell me
about the plan, Schmidt?

08:13.694 --> 08:15.360
Now I need to know
what happens.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.929
Why am I not supposed
to have a baby this way?

08:17.931 --> 08:21.266
As I saw it, your first
child was to be born

08:21.268 --> 08:24.102
between you and a
small Italian woman.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.104
Like a Maria?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.172
Yes, like a Maria.
Okay.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.540
She makes meatballs and soup,

08:28.542 --> 08:29.774
and does laundry
in a wooden bucket.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.877
Yeah, she does.
You guys have a child.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.445
It's a boy.
I'm incredibly involved.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.947
I give him the other half of
a walkie-talkie just in case

08:35.949 --> 08:37.616
he ever has a question in
the middle of the night.

08:37.618 --> 08:38.950
(imitates static)
Yes, I'm here.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.785
He hides his broccoli in
a planter during dinner.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.954
I wink. I look the other way.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.289
You mean e-broccoli.
What?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.957
'Cause it's the future.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.126
How far in the future are you
planning on having a child?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.461
Well, if we're talking
about me meeting a woman,

08:49.463 --> 08:50.896
falling in love
and having a kid?

08:50.898 --> 08:53.298
A very, very, very,
<i>very</i> long time.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.566
So many "verys."

08:54.568 --> 08:55.800
And let's face the facts.

08:55.802 --> 08:58.036
My love life is a disaster.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.739
Schmidt, this might be
my only chance of having a kid.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.641
Don't say that.
I'm saying it.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.476
And if I can't have a kid
with a woman,

09:04.478 --> 09:05.977
then maybe I'll have one
with my cousin.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.480
Horrifying wording

09:08.482 --> 09:11.550
for what actually is, well,
a beautiful sentiment.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.585
I-I want to do this.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.587
I want to experience this.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.722
You know, and I know
I won't be able to raise him,

09:17.724 --> 09:21.059
and... and that's
disappointing, but...

09:21.061 --> 09:23.828
I'll still see the little guy
at parties and such.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.664
Say hi. He'll say hi.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.166
Give him some fireworks
to pop off, or...

09:28.168 --> 09:29.734
or e-fireworks.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.169
Man, I'm just...

09:31.171 --> 09:33.171
I'm getting excited just
thinking about this.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.739
Look, it's not how
I originally planned it,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.841
but it's still another
Nick Miller in the world,

09:36.843 --> 09:39.411
and I'll take that
any way I can get it.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.845
You have my blessing.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.113
Well, it's embarrassing
to admit, but...

09:42.115 --> 09:43.615
thanks, man,
I kind of needed it.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.183
Yeah, absolutely.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.518
(laughs)

09:46.520 --> 09:49.054
You should get out of here, man.
I'm gonna go masturbate.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.021
Okay.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.023
(groaning)
We...

09:52.025 --> 09:54.859
really got after it there.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.695
I am so happy I could help.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.296
Like, I don't want to be...

09:58.298 --> 10:00.465
greedy about it, 'cause I know
I've already put on

10:00.467 --> 10:03.268
the most perfect dress once
today, and I should wait...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.470
You thinking what I'm thinking? I
really want to put it on again.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.871
You should put it on again.
I know!

10:06.873 --> 10:08.106
Okay, I'm going to go try it on.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.140
Okay, try it on again.
Okay.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.575
CECE:
<i> Oh, no!</i>

10:10.577 --> 10:13.311
Oh, no.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.714
What did we do?

10:15.716 --> 10:16.915
What is this?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.149
Oh, my God!

10:18.151 --> 10:19.551
How drunk were we?

10:19.553 --> 10:20.719
No.
No. Okay.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.153
You know what,
no, no, no, no.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.489
This is, you know what,
this is, this is good.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.991
Everything's all right.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.459
I mean, look,
you got mirrors.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.827
You know,
no one's ever done that before.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.395
I like it, you know.
I like the...

10:30.397 --> 10:32.597
Again, I can't talk enough
about the mirrors.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.766
Why is there a spot
for batteries?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.835
So the glass can light up.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.637
We were really excited
about that feature.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.741
Yeah. You look like
a prostitute for wizards.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.809
I look like a
bullfighter in space.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.978
I cannot get married
in this dress.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.346
Okay, so what do you
need me to do?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.849
Nothing. I don't
need your help.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.517
Okay. 'Cause I'm just...

10:52.519 --> 10:54.486
I'm gonna do it by myself.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.924
Well...

10:59.926 --> 11:01.259
Yeah, well, no, I...
You washed?

11:01.261 --> 11:02.527
Yeah, of course
I washed.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.262
Hey, why the...

11:04.264 --> 11:05.697
why the long faces?

11:05.699 --> 11:07.332
Shouldn't we be
celebrating here, guys?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.468
Listen, we, uh, we talked
to the doctor and, uh,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.704
turns out we can't afford
the procedure.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.773
Are you kidding me?

11:14.775 --> 11:17.008
So I just masturbated
for nothing?

11:17.010 --> 11:17.976
SCHMIDT:
You-you guys flew

11:17.978 --> 11:19.277
across the country.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.845
You didn't think about
any of this beforehand?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.480
We did little
to no research.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.615
But we still want to have

11:23.617 --> 11:25.483
a family, you know.
Yeah.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.019
We already fell in love
with the little bastard.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.621
Anyway, there is
one other option

11:29.623 --> 11:30.922
we could explore.

11:31.625 --> 11:33.625
What is it? Anything.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.026
Nick...

11:35.028 --> 11:37.462
I want you to have sex
with my wife.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.397
What? CAROL: Yeah,
we don't just

11:39.399 --> 11:41.132
need your reindeer,
we need Santa.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.134
SCHMIDT: What? What?
Yeah, come down the chimney.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.536
Feet first.
White Christmas.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.104
Bring a sackful of gifts.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.577
This is nuts.
I can't do this.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.512
This might be your only chance
to have a kid.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.181
Yeah, but then I have to
have sex with my cousin.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.515
I don't want to have... I don't
want to have sex with my cousin.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.917
It's not your cousin.
It's your cousin's wife.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.486
That's like letting a dog
drink water out of your mouth.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.321
You know, it's not great,
but it's legal.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.989
The point I'm trying
to make is,

12:04.991 --> 12:07.225
is I think I'd like another
Nick Miller in the world.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.993
All right.
Can you imagine?

12:08.995 --> 12:10.161
(chuckles)

12:10.163 --> 12:12.731
Come on, man, what do you say?

12:12.733 --> 12:15.033
(sighs)

12:15.035 --> 12:16.267
SCHMIDT:
<i> I think the best thing</i>

12:16.269 --> 12:17.836
to do here
is to just look at this

12:17.838 --> 12:19.337
like a medical procedure.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.673
Why is this guy in
this conversation here?

12:21.675 --> 12:23.408
Bobby, it's a losing battle.
Just move past it.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.744
And, Carol, look, I
don't want this to feel,

12:25.746 --> 12:27.011
I-I don't know, romantic.

12:27.013 --> 12:28.947
I don't want you
getting confused.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.782
There's a zero percent chance
of that happening.  Yeah.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.183
If you're suggesting that
I can't be romantic,

12:32.185 --> 12:33.685
then you're out
of your mind.

12:33.687 --> 12:34.686
SCHMIDT:
Yeah, excuse me,

12:34.688 --> 12:36.020
Nick is very romantic, okay?

12:36.022 --> 12:37.956
He does romantic things for me
all the time.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.924
Schmidt, what are
you talking about?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.626
Just the other week,
you were very romantic to me.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.195
When I fell down in the parking
lot and you picked me up?

12:44.197 --> 12:46.297
(talking indistinctly)

12:46.299 --> 12:48.733
(grunts)
Get up, dude!

12:48.735 --> 12:50.201
How was that romantic?!

12:50.203 --> 12:51.870
It was beautiful
and it was kind.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.538
You know, romance doesn't
always have to be sexual,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.540
you idiot.
You're the idiot!

12:55.542 --> 12:56.808
Don't. Don't.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.877
Honestly, you want
to do this right now?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.945
Give me one shot
at that big head,

13:00.947 --> 13:03.214
I'm gonna knock you out.
(chuckles)

13:03.216 --> 13:05.450
Dominated you physically.
Admit it. Yeah, defense.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.119
Can we put something
over the windows?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.655
I want it to be pitch black
in here, so I can't see...

13:10.657 --> 13:12.924
I don't like the way you look at
my body when you say that, Carol.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.092
Well... SCHMIDT: Okay, we
got to keep it positive.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.960
I agree. I think what
Nick is trying to say

13:15.962 --> 13:17.996
Uh-huh. is that he'd like
to be completely naked.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.899
Where are you getting this from?!
Objection, Your Honor! Strongly!

13:20.901 --> 13:22.667
'Cause I will be
wearing clothes!

13:22.669 --> 13:24.135
Overruled. Yeah.
Overruled.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.937
Yeah, stand down.
But I'll-I'll tell ya,

13:25.939 --> 13:28.740
I'm not wearing a condom!
End of discussion.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.241
(laughs)

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
Guys...

13:32.245 --> 13:34.345
such a clearly
great joke.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.580
Because obviously
I can't wear,

13:35.582 --> 13:37.515
you know...
Oh.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.584
We got to loosen
the vibe a little.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.419
Can we do something about this smell?
Oh, yeah.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.520
(sniffs) It is a
little rank, yeah.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.688
There is an odor.
Yeah.

13:43.690 --> 13:44.856
Well, I lost a
glass of milk.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.424
You lost a glass of milk?
Was it full?

13:46.426 --> 13:47.592
Yeah, it was
to the top.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.760
I could barely
carry it.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.028
Oh, that's outrageous!

13:50.030 --> 13:51.763
Oh, God.
Now, if you don't mind,

13:51.765 --> 13:54.165
I'd just like to bring things
down for a second here.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.434
Bob, Carol, um, I originally
bought this for Nick,

13:56.436 --> 13:59.704
but since he may never have
someone to give it to,

13:59.706 --> 14:02.106
I'd like for you guys
to have it.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.374
Mm-mm.
No, dude, no.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.109
We're Pats fan.
We hate the Bears.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.045
You don't like the onesie?
Pats are number onesie.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.613
Where did we land
on me being in the room?

14:08.615 --> 14:10.114
Get out, Schmidt!
Get the hell out of here!

14:10.116 --> 14:12.283
Look, I-I know that you
have a "no return" policy,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.118
but you have to take
this dress back, okay?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.120
I look like a rich person
in<i> The Hunger Games.</i>

14:16.122 --> 14:17.555
Yeah, I know. (chuckles)

14:17.557 --> 14:19.324
I was gonna stop you
from buying it,

14:19.326 --> 14:21.192
but I didn't,
so we're done here.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.063
Wrong!

14:25.065 --> 14:26.798
See, you may be done
with her, but you're not

14:26.800 --> 14:28.633
done with the law.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.802
Winston Bishop, LAPD.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.303
You're a cop?
The guy who was spinning around

14:32.305 --> 14:34.472
singing Patti LaBelle songs
yesterday?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.808
(high-pitched): ♪ I tidied up
my point of view ♪

14:36.810 --> 14:39.244
♪ I got a new attitude. ♪

14:39.246 --> 14:42.247
And you must be the one
who was serving champagne

14:42.249 --> 14:44.182
without a liquor license.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.516
We don't charge
for it.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.051
It's legal.

14:50.924 --> 14:53.558
Uh, not if it's being served
to a-a minor.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.659
Oh.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.194
Yeah. Oh, that's right.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.197
I'm 17 years old.
I'm a kid.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.999
You're a 17-year-old
police officer?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.166
I'm a cop prodigy.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.935
You see,
my school is the streets.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.337
But my other school
is school.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.106
'Cause-'cause I go to school.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.174
Like a school-school,
for learning.

15:10.176 --> 15:11.009
You are so stupid.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.343
No return policy

15:12.345 --> 15:13.578
is more important
than the love

15:13.580 --> 15:16.247
that brings us here today, so...

15:16.249 --> 15:19.484
This means a lot to her,
so please help her out.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.622
Well, that didn't work.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.692
Look, Cece,
I'm-I'm no good at this.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.694
I'm no help.
I'm just gonna...

15:29.696 --> 15:31.696
I'm just gonna take
a backseat to the wedding.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.964
No. Look...

15:32.966 --> 15:35.700
what you did in there
made me realize how much

15:35.702 --> 15:38.937
you... really care about me.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.476
I know that you're already
one of Schmidt's groomsmen,

15:45.478 --> 15:50.048
um, but I was hoping
you would maybe also consider

15:50.050 --> 15:52.617
being one of my bridesmaids.

15:52.619 --> 15:56.554
You want me to be a bridesmaid?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.056
If you don't want to, I...

15:58.058 --> 16:00.058
Do you know who you're talking to?
Yes?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.726
You're talking to Winnie the Bish!
Yeah.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.795
I would love
to be your bridesmaid!

16:03.797 --> 16:05.163
Yes?
Yes!

16:05.165 --> 16:06.564
Yes?
Yes!

16:06.566 --> 16:07.665
Oh...
Girl, you are

16:07.667 --> 16:09.734
under arrest
for taking my breath away!

16:09.736 --> 16:10.902
(laughs)

16:10.904 --> 16:12.804
What's with this
parachute top?

16:12.806 --> 16:14.305
It's good for movement,
hard to stain.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.907
I thought
it was appropriate.

16:15.909 --> 16:17.842
Okay. I don't know
what you think

16:17.844 --> 16:20.411
we're about to do, but I'm
keeping this very simple.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.847
I want to keep it simple.
Uh-huh. Great.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.949
Should we... should we just
make love now, then?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.284
"Make love"?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.419
What, are we riding horses
around on a beach topless?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.787
No, thank you.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.689
Just tip me over
and pour me out!

16:31.691 --> 16:33.925
Tip you over and pour you out?

16:33.927 --> 16:36.861
Yeah. It's that children's rhyme
that's also very sexual.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.830
It is not sexual at all.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.431
It is in this case.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.766
Carol, I'm g...
I'm gonna need you

16:41.768 --> 16:43.334
to be a little bit nicer
to me, please.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.103
Oh, my God, are you serious?
I can't p...

16:45.105 --> 16:47.538
Listen, I can't perform sexually
if I don't feel

16:47.540 --> 16:50.008
a-at least a little desired.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.010
Okay. Could you give me any
sort of a compliment? Anything.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.212
We'll go and then we'll just...
That will get me started.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.280
I'll say something nice about
you then and we can get into it.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.216
(groans)

16:58.218 --> 16:59.784
Just one compliment.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.853
Nothing on the front.
Can you turn around?

17:03.123 --> 17:04.389
No. Keep turning.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.723
No.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.191
Stop. Ah!

17:07.193 --> 17:08.860
Okay, I won't... Okay.
Please.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.128
Um...

17:10.130 --> 17:11.796
First thing
that pops in your head.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.398
(sighs)

17:13.400 --> 17:16.467
Oh, Nicky,
you're such a sexy boy.

17:16.469 --> 17:17.668
(groans)

17:17.670 --> 17:19.971
It felt crazy
coming out of my mouth. Right?

17:19.973 --> 17:21.139
Just some... just something simple.
Oh, my God.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.007
Just take your pants off
and get in bed.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.175
Okay, yeah. All right!

17:24.177 --> 17:26.210
Okay?
(breathing deeply)

17:27.380 --> 17:29.881
Come on!

17:31.684 --> 17:33.751
(sportscast playing over TV)

17:35.688 --> 17:38.356
Any plans to go to the beach
while you're in Los Angeles?

17:38.358 --> 17:40.358
CAROL: Bob!
He's freaking out!

17:40.360 --> 17:42.693
Oh.
Nick?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.595
I'm not freaking out. I'm fine.
Just my heart's beating really fast.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.264
I feel a bit dizzy. CAROL:
Are you freaking kidding me?

17:46.266 --> 17:47.565
Just need one sec.
This is ridiculous!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.100
All I did was take my shoes off.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.334
Stand up and deliver!
What happened? What happened?

17:50.336 --> 17:51.936
Is it over? Did you like it?
No! Look at him.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.938
I just need one minute.
I just need one minute.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.007
Everything's cool! Deal's on.
I just need one minute.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.842
Get ahold of yourself, man!
Hey, I'm ovulating

17:57.844 --> 18:00.211
for two more hours.
I need to get plowed!

18:00.213 --> 18:01.345
You're dressed like
you're gonna run a marathon!

18:01.347 --> 18:02.447
Take off your windbreaker!

18:02.449 --> 18:03.948
Schmidt, tell them
to stop yelling at me!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.950
No! You compose yourself
and you make a miracle,

18:05.952 --> 18:08.786
or I will squeeze one out of you
like a bottle of mustard!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.354
What?!
Take your pants off!

18:10.356 --> 18:11.589
There's not even
a belt or a button!

18:11.591 --> 18:12.924
Just pull 'em down!

18:12.926 --> 18:15.226
Yeah, let's go with the miracle already!
Come on, man!

18:15.228 --> 18:17.395
(all shouting)
No! Stop! Stop!

18:17.397 --> 18:18.863
Just take your pants off!
Five minutes, and it's done.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.398
I don't like this!
I don't like this!

18:20.400 --> 18:22.066
Take your pants off!
Do it! Do it, Nick!

18:22.068 --> 18:23.034
Come on, man! Do it!

18:23.036 --> 18:24.535
Take it out and do it!

18:24.537 --> 18:26.104
Boundaries!
I said I need boundaries!

18:26.106 --> 18:27.371
Get out of my way!

18:27.373 --> 18:28.639
I need boundaries!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.475
Unbelievable.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.642
Wow. So typical.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.778
(sighs)

18:33.780 --> 18:35.713
Oh, look at that.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.281
There's the glass of milk.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.283
Really is filled to the brim.
It's like an infinity pool.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.385
Wow, how the hell
did he carry that thing?

18:45.992 --> 18:47.091
NICK:<i> Bobby, I'm sorry.</i>
<i> I feel terrible.</i>

18:47.093 --> 18:48.726
No, no, no, no.
It was a bad call.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.928
Yeah, I guess it's weird to have
sex with your cousin's wife.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.164
No. I...

18:53.166 --> 18:54.765
I just can't
stomach my kid

18:54.767 --> 18:56.167
coming from a Bears fan,
that's all.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.735
There's nothing wrong
with being a Bears fan.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.237
That's all I'm gonna say to that.
There kind of is.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.172
No, it's weird to have sex
with your cousin's wife.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.740
That's what's weird.
We're gonna ask Cousin Terry.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.308
He's got no arm past his elbow,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.410
but it was an accident;
it's not genetic.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.812
It's a good call.
He's very good-looking.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.515
Uh, excuse me.
So we're not having a baby?

19:10.517 --> 19:11.649
Well, this is...

19:11.651 --> 19:13.084
this is just great.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.152
If you can't tell,

19:14.154 --> 19:17.421
I<i> am</i> being sarcastic.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.924
What's with that guy?

19:19.926 --> 19:22.426
(sighs)
He was really fat as a kid.

19:22.428 --> 19:24.262
Now I get it.
Ah, that makes sense.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.396
Yeah.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.835
We need to have a
talk about today.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.937
I know. Boundaries.
No.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.839
It's...

19:34.841 --> 19:37.008
I want you to
have something.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.219
What's this for?

19:48.221 --> 19:50.221
I want you to save that
and give it back to me

19:50.223 --> 19:51.689
when I have my own kid.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.692
What do you mean,
you're gonna have your own kid?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.794
When I have my own kid.
Don't make a big deal of it.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.197
I just... I don't...
I don't hate your plan.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.398
I kind of like it.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.899
Things have been
going pretty good

20:01.901 --> 20:04.902
for me lately, and I-I would
like to meet my own Maria.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.304
With-a the meatballs.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.572
With-a the red sauce.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.340
(laughs):
With-a the red sauce.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.142
I want to see that
plan you got for me.

20:11.144 --> 20:12.343
Well, come on, man.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.978
It's a rough draft,
but you should check it out.

20:13.980 --> 20:15.413
What do we got
here, chief?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.715
"Nick has a boy.
He calls him Gio."

20:17.717 --> 20:21.719
We die on the same day in 2098?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.554
You murder me
and then kill yourself.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.923
There's not a chance
I make it to 2098.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.158
Not a chance.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.860
I don't want to
see the 2050s.

20:29.862 --> 20:31.996
Oddly enough, you won't.

20:31.998 --> 20:36.601
See? I freeze you
from 2050 to 2064.

20:36.603 --> 20:39.003
That's why you're the genius.
That's why you're the genius.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.004
Thank you.
(chuckles)

20:40.006 --> 20:42.006
Can you see her?
Jess?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.608
Hey. Hey, guys.
I pulled some strings.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.176
I got her a note
that says we're here.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.278
You are amazing. I don't
know why every wedding

20:47.280 --> 20:48.679
doesn't have
a bridesman.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.681
Ooh, I'm-a get so naked
at that bachelorette party!

20:50.683 --> 20:52.116
That's one reason.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.184
(all cheering)

20:53.186 --> 20:54.852
CECE and NICK:
Jess!

20:54.854 --> 20:56.721
Okay, Nick, the bag, the bag,
the bag, the bag. Okay. Okay.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.189
I got it, I got it. I got the bag.
What do you mean, the bag?

20:58.191 --> 20:59.790
Oh, come on! Just one peek!
No!

20:59.792 --> 21:01.359
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.693
Okay. We good?

21:02.695 --> 21:04.195
Yeah, we're good.
Okay.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.130
(exhales)

21:06.132 --> 21:08.366
Hey. Hey, hey, guys.
She's writing something.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.135
Wait for it. Oh...

21:11.137 --> 21:13.704
What? What's happening?
Don't worry. Nothing.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.406
I think she's writing
something else.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.541
Okay. All right.
That's something.

21:17.543 --> 21:18.943
What's going on?!
Nice.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.878
NICK: We miss you, too!
CECE: Aw, we miss you, too!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.713
All right, I can't take it anymore!
CECE: No!

21:22.715 --> 21:24.482
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, Jess can fix it.

21:24.484 --> 21:25.783
Jess can fix it.
Schmidt? Schmidt?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.385
CECE:
Just... No, no.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.253
Cover up. It's not
gonna look like this.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.821
I got him. I got him.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.457
You got him? Okay.
Winston, I got him. It's fine.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.993
See? Everything's fine!
This isn't romantic?

21:35.995 --> 21:37.995
NICK:<i> Come back soon! </i>
WINSTON:<i> I love you!</i>
