WEBVTT

00:05.788 --> 00:07.391
DANA: Kevin!

00:10.665 --> 00:12.535
KEVIN: Dana?

00:14.205 --> 00:15.675
Dana?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.427
Daa-na?

00:25.829 --> 00:29.335
(low mysterious music)

00:30.037 --> 00:32.040
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fuck?

00:32.140 --> 00:34.613
What the fuck was that? Dana?

00:34.713 --> 00:36.282
What the fuck was that?

00:37.886 --> 00:39.823
(thud)

00:39.923 --> 00:42.795
Dana. Dana. Dana!

00:42.895 --> 00:44.766
(screams)

00:44.900 --> 00:48.072
Hey, it's me.
It's me. It's me.

00:48.172 --> 00:51.078
It's Kevin. Dana! It's me.

00:51.178 --> 00:53.617
Dana, it's me.
It's me.

00:55.220 --> 00:58.159
(panting)

01:01.767 --> 01:03.403
Dana, this-- uh...

01:03.504 --> 01:07.578
I don't even know this.
This is-- this is terrifying.

01:07.678 --> 01:10.283
How did all this happen to you
just now?

01:10.383 --> 01:11.653
How long was I gone?

01:11.787 --> 01:14.693
Like, less than a minute.
Not even. Seconds.

01:17.499 --> 01:21.573
It felt like I was gone
for an hour at least.

01:23.476 --> 01:24.813
The first time
I think this happened,

01:24.947 --> 01:26.650
it was only a few minutes,

01:26.750 --> 01:28.687
and then the next time,
it was a little bit longer.

01:28.787 --> 01:31.660
It's getting worse, Kevin.
I have to do something.

01:32.796 --> 01:34.365
Do what?

01:34.465 --> 01:36.302
Shouldn't we be trying
to get out of here?

01:36.402 --> 01:38.306
What if it's this house?

01:39.175 --> 01:40.544
Dana?

01:41.446 --> 01:42.782
DANA: I need new clothes.

01:44.485 --> 01:47.391
If it happens again, I can't
be in a fucking bathrobe.

01:50.598 --> 01:52.702
Are you sure you
don't want to call your aunt?

01:54.673 --> 01:56.442
DANA: She already thinks
I'm crazy.

01:56.543 --> 01:58.312
KEVIN: But she's the only one
who can tell you

01:58.446 --> 02:00.518
about your mother
or any of this stuff, right?

02:01.954 --> 02:03.423
(doorbell rings)

02:03.524 --> 02:05.193
Who the fuck is that?

02:05.293 --> 02:07.565
I don't know, but I think
you need to get that.

02:09.836 --> 02:11.372
Look at me.

02:14.245 --> 02:16.349
(doorbell rings again)

02:16.449 --> 02:18.319
KEVIN: I'm coming.

02:19.756 --> 02:21.258
NEIGHBOR: Hello again.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.162
I'm sorry to bother you,

02:23.262 --> 02:27.505
but have you seen a... cat?

02:27.605 --> 02:30.410
Uh, a cat?
No. Sorry.

02:30.511 --> 02:32.615
Well, do you think
maybe your friend has seen
her?

02:32.715 --> 02:33.884
KEVIN: Dana?

02:34.018 --> 02:37.925
I, I don't know.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.598
Would you mind
if I asked her myself?

02:40.732 --> 02:44.706
You know,
Dana's actually asleep.

02:44.806 --> 02:45.908
Asleep?

02:46.008 --> 02:47.645
KEVIN: You know, we both were.

02:47.745 --> 02:49.883
It's actually been a really
long day of being here,

02:49.983 --> 02:51.753
that sort of thing.

02:51.887 --> 02:53.489
NEIGHBOR: Yes.

03:00.303 --> 03:02.340
(phone buzzes)

03:04.044 --> 03:05.514
Yes?

03:05.614 --> 03:07.552
-DANA: Niecy.
-What do you need?

03:07.652 --> 03:10.390
Can I ask you a question?
It's about my mother.

03:11.827 --> 03:14.833
-What about her?
-You said you live in the
area.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.670
Around the corner
on Coronado.

03:16.770 --> 03:18.807
Okay. Yeah,
I've never seen you before.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.345
You know everyone around here?

03:21.445 --> 03:23.717
How do
you two know each other?

03:24.986 --> 03:26.656
We went to college together.

03:26.923 --> 03:29.696
When you said she wasn't well,
what did you mean by that?

03:32.401 --> 03:34.471
Oh-kay.

03:36.677 --> 03:39.481
-Why are you asking me this?
-DANA: What did you mean
by that?

03:39.582 --> 03:40.951
What exactly was
wrong with her?

03:42.387 --> 03:43.991
Are you worried
about something?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.728
Please answer me.

03:45.828 --> 03:49.536
Your mother...
she could be depressive.

03:49.670 --> 03:52.407
She had fits of mania
and near the end of her life,

03:52.508 --> 03:54.746
she claimed to see things

03:54.846 --> 03:56.817
that weren't there.

03:58.086 --> 03:59.956
See what things?

04:00.357 --> 04:01.827
Dana, I don't like
these questions.

04:01.927 --> 04:03.831
Where are you getting
all this from?

04:03.931 --> 04:06.670
What happened when they died?
When my mother and father
died?

04:06.770 --> 04:09.609
Who was driving?
Was she driving?

04:09.709 --> 04:12.615
-Yes.
-Was her body ever recovered?

04:12.715 --> 04:14.451
Uh...

04:15.988 --> 04:17.558
No.

04:18.961 --> 04:21.666
Do you think Dana would mind
if I checked the backyard?

04:21.766 --> 04:24.639
The former occupant
had a tendency

04:24.739 --> 04:26.710
to feed Princess
behind our backs and--

04:26.810 --> 04:28.614
Sure.
Have a good night.

04:30.518 --> 04:31.920
(door latch clicks)

04:32.956 --> 04:34.826
KEVIN: (harsh whisper) Dana.

04:38.466 --> 04:39.903
Dana!

04:40.003 --> 04:41.606
NIECY: It was assumed

04:41.740 --> 04:44.712
she tried to swim away
from the vehicle.

04:45.748 --> 04:46.983
Dana?

04:49.923 --> 04:51.392
Dana?

04:51.894 --> 04:54.364
-KEVIN: Dana!
-Look. Who is that?

04:54.464 --> 04:55.868
I gotta go.
I'll call you tomorrow.

04:56.002 --> 04:57.772
-Bye.
-Dana? Hell--?

04:58.674 --> 05:00.544
-KEVIN: Dana?
-In here.

05:00.644 --> 05:02.347
Oh, my God.
What are-- what are you doing?

05:02.447 --> 05:03.650
I just got off the phone
with aunt.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.420
My mother's body
was never found

05:05.521 --> 05:06.923
-which means she's still
alive. -What?

05:07.023 --> 05:09.896
My parents. My parents.
She died, or they died,

05:10.030 --> 05:11.700
in a car crash.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.670
No one ever knew what
happened. But now I'm
realizing

05:13.770 --> 05:15.908
that she must
have been driving.

05:16.275 --> 05:17.645
She must've
got pulled back in time,

05:17.779 --> 05:19.849
and lost control of the car

05:19.949 --> 05:21.653
or I don't know.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.893
Who was that at the door?

05:25.160 --> 05:29.569
Um, your neighbor again
with some bullshit about a
cat.

05:31.072 --> 05:32.575
The fucking cat.

05:32.675 --> 05:34.779
-You saw her cats?
-Yeah. Earlier.

05:35.514 --> 05:37.117
The cat,
it came to the back door,

05:37.217 --> 05:39.556
and I-- I picked it up.

05:40.157 --> 05:44.866
I held it and that's
when I got pulled back.

05:46.536 --> 05:48.439
And he left my arms.
He's still there.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.876
You find her?

05:50.077 --> 05:52.548
No, but something very bad
is going on next door.

05:52.682 --> 05:55.654
-What?
-That guy answered the door
again.

05:55.754 --> 05:57.925
And this time
he was covered in blood.

05:58.059 --> 06:01.398
I mean, he wasn't covered
in blood, but there was blood
on his neck.

06:01.499 --> 06:03.770
Then I asked
where she was.

06:03.870 --> 06:05.608
He told me that
she was asleep.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.513
And so then I asked him
about Princess Di,

06:08.613 --> 06:10.818
and he told me
that he hadn't seen her.

06:10.918 --> 06:14.492
And then I overheard them
talking and she wasn't asleep.

06:14.592 --> 06:15.894
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
You overheard--

06:15.994 --> 06:17.932
Carlo, please stop
interrupting me.

06:18.032 --> 06:19.969
I'm trying to finish
telling you.

06:20.069 --> 06:23.810
I overheard them talking.
She was not asleep.

06:24.077 --> 06:25.581
And then...

06:26.015 --> 06:29.555
I heard her mention something
about a cat.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.462
-What'd she say?
-Here it is.

06:33.563 --> 06:34.832
I don't know.

06:34.932 --> 06:37.838
(sighs) So what do you want to
do?

06:37.938 --> 06:39.909
I want to know if anyone else
has seen anything.

06:40.009 --> 06:42.581
But what if it's the house,
Dana?

06:42.681 --> 06:44.752
And I'm not saying that
I'm someone

06:44.852 --> 06:47.758
who believes in things
like that,

06:47.858 --> 06:49.996
but I'm--
I'm just getting freaked out.

06:50.096 --> 06:52.868
It's not the house, Kevin,
it's me. Me.

06:52.968 --> 06:54.672
It's going to happen
no matter where I am.

06:54.772 --> 06:57.477
My mother,
she was driving, and she--

06:57.578 --> 06:58.814
I know what you think
is happening.

06:58.914 --> 07:01.151
You can go
but I have to stay.

07:01.251 --> 07:02.855
I have to go back.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.093
What's happening?

07:09.803 --> 07:11.840
I can't leave you alone
like this.

07:11.940 --> 07:13.744
And the people next door,
they know my name.

07:13.844 --> 07:15.614
They know where I live.
Dana, please.

07:15.748 --> 07:17.685
If something happens to you,
I'm in trouble.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.722
Please.
Dana, please come with me.

07:19.822 --> 07:21.726
-Kevin.
-If something happens,
it happens.

07:21.826 --> 07:23.730
But we got to get out
of this house.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.168
Please. We got to get
off this block.

07:27.772 --> 07:29.509
What's--
What's happening?

07:29.609 --> 07:31.846
DANA: It's happening again.
Kevin.

07:33.316 --> 07:36.690
-Oh, no, no, no.
-(screams)

07:36.790 --> 07:38.727
-Dana.
-(Dana screams)

08:02.675 --> 08:04.679
Let me go.
This is it.

08:07.718 --> 08:09.989
Rufus, I'm coming.

08:16.736 --> 08:18.072
(vomiting)

08:22.180 --> 08:24.017
(gasps)

08:27.324 --> 08:29.061
DANA: Kevin!

08:43.289 --> 08:44.792
-What's your name?
-Nigel.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.730
Nigel, you need to run
and go get help.

08:47.064 --> 08:48.967
I wasn't supposed to let him
climb no trees.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.105
They're going to kill me
if he's dead.

08:52.742 --> 08:54.812
This man,
he's going to go with you,
okay?

08:58.152 --> 09:00.223
He's going to tell them
that it wasn't your fault,

09:00.323 --> 09:01.860
but you have to go right now.

09:04.031 --> 09:07.605
This is it. This is him.
We have to save him.

09:07.772 --> 09:09.174
What am I supposed to say?

09:09.274 --> 09:12.147
Just tell them
that, um, we're travelers.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.184
And we came upon them.

09:21.165 --> 09:22.835
(boy moans)

09:22.935 --> 09:25.607
Hey, Rufus. Hey, Rufus. Hey.
Stay awake.

09:25.741 --> 09:27.878
Stay awake.
Stay with me.

09:45.714 --> 09:47.083
KEVIN: Hey!

09:50.390 --> 09:51.993
Where's Master Rufus?

09:53.062 --> 09:54.866
Master Ruf
fell out the tree, sir,

09:54.966 --> 09:57.203
and his legs
were all sideways.

09:57.303 --> 09:59.709
And he wouldn't get up.
Then this woman,

09:59.809 --> 10:01.913
dressed like a man,
came out of the woods,

10:02.815 --> 10:04.652
and they sent me here, sir.

10:04.886 --> 10:06.789
And they said for me
to come and get help.

10:06.923 --> 10:09.194
Go and call on Dr. West,
quickly.

10:13.002 --> 10:16.341
Forgive me, sir,
but I must ask who you are.

10:17.344 --> 10:18.680
We are travelers.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.884
We came upon them.
Traveling.

10:20.984 --> 10:24.057
Wait here.
I'll bring my wagon.

10:40.991 --> 10:43.730
Sir Rufus, stay awake.
Hey, stay with me.

10:44.198 --> 10:45.868
-Stay with me.
-(Rufus groaning)

10:47.337 --> 10:49.876
-(stomping)
-You're gonna be okay.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.882
-He alive?
-Yeah.

10:52.982 --> 10:54.752
Yeah, I got it.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.795
(Rufus moans)

11:06.342 --> 11:08.345
How did you know how
to make a splint?

11:10.016 --> 11:11.218
TV.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.924
-I'm freaking out.
-Don't.

11:14.024 --> 11:16.361
Stay calm.
Pretend it's like a game.

11:16.529 --> 11:18.098
Can you do that?

11:21.105 --> 11:22.407
Yes.

11:22.842 --> 11:24.946
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

11:25.046 --> 11:26.448
-I'm right here.
-Cold.

11:26.549 --> 11:28.085
I'm right here with you.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.166
(Rufus groaning)

11:56.943 --> 11:58.780
If I lose even one blossom

11:58.880 --> 12:00.082
to this grass
before my party

12:00.182 --> 12:01.786
it's the end
of all three of you.

12:01.886 --> 12:03.389
These come
all the way from France.

12:06.896 --> 12:08.867
Who is that?

12:11.005 --> 12:14.344
(gasps) No! Rufus!

12:14.444 --> 12:17.785
-Oh, my Rufus.
-Come over and let me bring
Master Rufus inside.

12:17.885 --> 12:19.220
-His leg is broke.
-Open this!

12:19.855 --> 12:22.528
What happened to my baby?

12:22.628 --> 12:24.097
It's okay. Mama's here.

12:24.197 --> 12:26.034
So why don't you shut up
with all that noise?

12:26.134 --> 12:28.038
What's wrong with you?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.343
Young Master Rufus fell out of
a tree. Broke his leg.

12:30.443 --> 12:31.946
Where's Nigel?

12:32.046 --> 12:33.850
I called him away to carry
some wood for me

12:33.950 --> 12:35.252
in preparation for the storm.

12:35.352 --> 12:37.357
Master Rufus was alone.
It was my mistake.

12:37.492 --> 12:38.927
You bet it is.

12:39.027 --> 12:40.797
But I sent him ahead
to summon Dr. West

12:40.897 --> 12:42.200
-before the roads get too
rough. -Go!

12:42.300 --> 12:44.037
Dr. West?

12:44.605 --> 12:46.041
Can you talk to me?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.212
Carry this demon
up to his bedroom

12:48.346 --> 12:49.882
and out of my sight.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.220
Can I believe this?

12:55.059 --> 12:57.163
Oh, get him.

12:57.965 --> 12:59.535
Careful! Careful!

12:59.736 --> 13:01.238
-You beast.
-Shut up, Margaret.

13:01.372 --> 13:03.142
Watch his head.

13:04.377 --> 13:06.248
-How do we go back?
-WOMAN: It's okay, baby.

13:06.348 --> 13:07.483
I don't know.

13:07.584 --> 13:09.120
Who are you?

13:14.331 --> 13:16.134
We're travelers.

13:16.368 --> 13:17.971
We were traveling

13:18.071 --> 13:20.476
when we found him in the
woods, passing through.

13:21.412 --> 13:23.449
What is the costume?

13:25.353 --> 13:26.889
We were robbed.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.526
CHARLES: Thomas.

13:29.428 --> 13:31.264
Charles, I'm so sorry.

13:31.398 --> 13:33.335
-Forgive this intrusion.
-Oh, no, no.

13:33.435 --> 13:35.540
Forgive me for intruding.
Clearly, you have
a family emergency

13:35.674 --> 13:38.947
that needs tending to.
Allow me to take my leave.

13:39.047 --> 13:40.884
Charles, no.
You must stay.

13:41.018 --> 13:42.554
We were just
getting down to business,

13:42.654 --> 13:45.393
and Sarah
has prepared us a feast.

13:45.528 --> 13:48.465
Tom, your son needs attention.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.837
At least come back
for our party tomorrow.

13:50.937 --> 13:52.273
CHARLES: We'll see.

13:53.342 --> 13:54.545
Yeah.

13:56.516 --> 13:58.052
Damnit!

14:00.123 --> 14:02.528
Why don't you come
on inside and get warm, hmm?

14:02.628 --> 14:03.963
It's the least I can do.

14:04.063 --> 14:05.534
-Sumana?
-Yes, sir.

14:05.634 --> 14:08.172
Get this man some warm clothes
and pair of decent shoes.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.176
-Yes, sir.
-You, take her to the
cookhouse,

14:10.276 --> 14:11.946
bring him something
warm to eat.

14:13.015 --> 14:14.417
You can come with me, sir.

14:14.652 --> 14:16.354
Luke!

14:16.923 --> 14:19.127
What the fuck?
What are we doing?

14:19.227 --> 14:20.997
Just play along.
We have to act like it's real

14:21.097 --> 14:22.467
until we get to my mom.

14:22.602 --> 14:24.605
I just need someone
to tell me how to get to her.

14:24.705 --> 14:27.176
Just go inside.
I'll catch up with you
in a minute.

14:27.443 --> 14:30.116
What if he starts asking
me questions?

14:30.216 --> 14:32.353
-What do I say?
-Just make something up.

14:32.655 --> 14:33.957
It doesn't matter.

14:34.057 --> 14:35.426
We can do this.

14:40.102 --> 14:41.506
WOMAN: Sir, you ready?

14:56.021 --> 14:57.392
I'm Dana by the way.

15:01.044 --> 15:02.380
What's your name?

15:04.585 --> 15:07.290
Do you know Olivia?
Do you know where she lives?

15:18.747 --> 15:21.218
You're going to have to wait.
I'm in the middle of serving,

15:21.352 --> 15:23.121
and I still got to finish
Master Tom's whole supper.

15:23.221 --> 15:24.492
In fact,
go check on that pie.

15:24.626 --> 15:27.463
I'm actually
looking for Olivia.

15:35.346 --> 15:37.350
Go on.
Take a seat.

16:02.267 --> 16:04.437
You know, I can--
I can take it from here.

16:15.359 --> 16:16.428
See?

16:16.796 --> 16:19.100
TOM: Never call a doctor
without consulting me first.

16:19.200 --> 16:23.275
And especially not
this godforsaken crook Dr.
West.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.580
I mean, how do you expect me
to pay for all this?

16:25.680 --> 16:27.684
MAN: He's amenable to
bartering for his services.

16:27.784 --> 16:29.454
His services?

16:31.325 --> 16:33.428
There was a man
who tends to my horses.

16:33.529 --> 16:35.266
He might take you.

16:35.400 --> 16:39.040
Well, I suggest you go
figure out what that trade is,

16:39.140 --> 16:41.411
or else you'll be working
that debt off on Sundays.

16:42.548 --> 16:44.317
Is my dresser
failing in her assistance?

16:44.417 --> 16:45.554
No, I, um--

16:45.654 --> 16:48.292
I'm just used
to undressing myself.

16:48.426 --> 16:50.062
Sumana,
you are dismissed.

16:50.162 --> 16:51.566
Yes, Master Tom.

16:55.774 --> 16:57.644
This will warm you up.

16:59.815 --> 17:01.318
Thank you.

17:01.719 --> 17:03.255
Please.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.359
(clears throat)

17:07.163 --> 17:08.666
(sighs)

17:08.766 --> 17:12.440
So tell me more about
this robbery that took place.

17:12.575 --> 17:16.314
There were three of them
and they circled us.

17:16.414 --> 17:22.059
One of them had a gun,
and, uh, the other two had
a...

17:22.159 --> 17:24.063
-Knives?
-Yes.

17:24.163 --> 17:27.671
And the one with the gun,
he was big.

17:27.771 --> 17:30.777
And he came up on us

17:30.877 --> 17:33.482
and pointed that gun
in my face

17:33.617 --> 17:39.127
and said,
"Hand over the bags."

17:39.862 --> 17:41.799
So I did.
And the horse.

17:41.899 --> 17:43.201
And your shoes?

17:43.335 --> 17:45.272
Yes, and my shoes
and my coat.

17:45.372 --> 17:47.076
It was very scary.

17:47.176 --> 17:49.480
Now, that's unfortunate.

17:50.584 --> 17:53.221
-Where were you headed?
-South.

17:53.321 --> 17:56.595
-South.
-My uncle recently passed
away.

17:56.695 --> 17:58.499
-Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that.
-Thank you.

17:58.633 --> 18:01.471
Me and Dana,
we were on our way to--

18:01.572 --> 18:04.511
Dana?
That's your slave's name?

18:07.951 --> 18:10.790
-Mr. Franklin?
-Yes.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.295
The way she talks
is quite strange.

18:13.395 --> 18:15.634
From whence was she procured?

18:15.734 --> 18:17.504
North in New York.

18:18.506 --> 18:20.242
New York.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.581
Is that how all the niggers
talk in New York?

18:22.681 --> 18:27.524
They? I don't know.
Um... That's how she talks.

18:29.394 --> 18:32.166
And she's the only slave
I've ever had, so.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.468
I see.

18:33.569 --> 18:36.542
So you are new
to the arrangement them?

18:36.642 --> 18:37.778
Yeah, relatively.

18:37.878 --> 18:39.548
Do you happen
to know where she is, Dana?

18:39.648 --> 18:41.418
Well, I'm sure
she'd be around soon enough.

18:41.519 --> 18:44.290
Now, I don't mean to pry
into your affairs, Mr.
Franklin,

18:44.424 --> 18:47.330
but as someone
with experience in the matter,

18:47.430 --> 18:50.235
my advice would be
unless the amusements

18:50.335 --> 18:52.541
that girl provides
are singular,

18:52.708 --> 18:57.483
you might do best to trade her
in for a more docile variety.

18:57.584 --> 19:00.557
She's probably what got
you robbed in the first place.

19:00.657 --> 19:03.395
Look, a slave like that
is wont to prioritize

19:03.496 --> 19:05.299
their own safety
over that of their master.

19:05.399 --> 19:08.338
I-- I have to use a bathroom.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.409
You wish to take
a bath?

19:10.510 --> 19:13.916
No, I--
I need to relieve myself.

19:14.016 --> 19:16.187
I understand.
Of course.

19:16.287 --> 19:18.158
Our privy is out that way.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.828
-Thank you.
-Mmm.

19:20.229 --> 19:21.866
-Take your overcoat.
-Yeah.

19:21.966 --> 19:23.569
Oh, yes. Yes.

19:40.402 --> 19:42.406
WOMAN: That's not for you.
Get.

20:00.877 --> 20:02.346
It is you, isn't it?

20:02.446 --> 20:03.649
Wasn't sure at first.

20:03.749 --> 20:06.254
-Is that you know who?
-Who?

20:06.354 --> 20:08.793
The devil,
the man you came with?

20:09.562 --> 20:12.667
No, he's just a man.

20:12.767 --> 20:14.470
A-- He's a friend.

20:14.571 --> 20:16.575
I need to get to Olivia
immediately.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.513
I don't think
that's gonna happen tonight.

20:18.613 --> 20:20.415
Trying to get there and back
without getting stuck?

20:20.516 --> 20:22.654
I can't risk losing
an animal in this cold.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.323
But it's important.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.829
Something happened between
y'all on the patrol, didn't
it?

20:26.929 --> 20:29.501
The man ain't been seen ever
since and Olivia won't say.

20:29.601 --> 20:31.505
How long has it been
since we last saw each other?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.876
It must be about
three or four months now.

20:33.976 --> 20:35.547
-Why?
-Dana?

20:38.786 --> 20:40.422
Can I have a word?

20:43.930 --> 20:45.466
Excuse me.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.626
Kevin, what's going on?

21:02.935 --> 21:06.642
They think-- they think
you're my slave.

21:07.110 --> 21:09.848
Yeah. That's not surprising.

21:09.948 --> 21:13.288
-What are we gonna do?
-Just keep a low profile.

21:13.388 --> 21:16.060
With the weather, there's no
way we're gonna get to my
mom's, so.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.597
Dana,
we cannot stay here.

21:17.697 --> 21:19.367
-We have to go back.
-I know,

21:19.467 --> 21:21.037
but I don't
have control over it.

21:21.137 --> 21:24.410
I don't even know if there's
a way to have control over it.

21:25.112 --> 21:27.551
And every time I come here,
I stay a little bit longer.

21:27.651 --> 21:29.588
So it's just something
we have to figure out.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.861
Just stay close to me.

21:33.195 --> 21:37.571
Tell them that we can't
be separated and then...

21:37.671 --> 21:40.309
-we can go.
-Master Franklin.

21:40.511 --> 21:42.714
Your presence is requested
in the house.

21:43.415 --> 21:44.585
TOM: Here he is.

21:44.719 --> 21:46.755
Mr. Franklin meet Dr. West.

21:46.855 --> 21:48.024
(choking cough)

21:48.124 --> 21:51.699
Dr. West.
Uh, t is a pleasure.

21:51.799 --> 21:55.540
(coughing)

21:55.640 --> 21:58.345
I was informed
there was an able-bodied man

21:58.445 --> 21:59.715
in the vicinity,

21:59.815 --> 22:01.585
and I thought
it was just our luck,

22:01.685 --> 22:04.357
because between
the young boy and his mother,

22:04.826 --> 22:07.697
it's going
to be a three-man job.

22:08.265 --> 22:10.402
TOM: Margaret is going
to be a handful.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.772
Though, in her defense.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.643
it is never pleasant,
in my experience,

22:13.743 --> 22:15.880
for a mother
to see her child bled.

22:16.014 --> 22:18.519
-Uh, bled?
-Yes.

22:18.753 --> 22:21.725
We do not know how long the
child has been on the
elements.

22:21.825 --> 22:24.130
We must bleed young Rufus
to rid the blood

22:24.230 --> 22:26.502
of any fever
he incurred as a result.

22:26.602 --> 22:30.042
I don't think
that's necessary.

22:32.614 --> 22:34.918
I mean, he wasn't out there
for very long.

22:35.319 --> 22:38.158
And who are you to tell me
what is necessary

22:38.258 --> 22:40.429
or not necessary, negress?

22:40.530 --> 22:42.399
Um, um...

22:42.500 --> 22:49.748
My servant is actually the one
who found him and healed him.

22:49.848 --> 22:54.925
She is, uh, actually
very skilled in healing.

22:59.000 --> 23:04.010
She did prepare
a sort of splint for his leg.

23:06.949 --> 23:09.921
One of these so-called
root women, I presume.

23:12.661 --> 23:16.000
Well, I assure you, wench,

23:16.100 --> 23:18.873
medicine is a far more
sophisticated art

23:18.973 --> 23:22.514
than your primitive man
will ever comprehend.

23:22.614 --> 23:24.718
Mr. Franklin,
do me the generosity

23:24.818 --> 23:26.789
of keeping your slave quiet.

23:27.190 --> 23:32.433
It's bad enough she has the
gall to look me in the eye.

23:32.534 --> 23:35.974
Now you will
remove Mrs. Weylin.

23:36.108 --> 23:37.777
You must block the door.

23:37.877 --> 23:40.616
Luke and I will
set about resetting the leg.

23:40.716 --> 23:42.587
Would you like
to wash your hands, sir?

23:42.687 --> 23:45.560
No, no, no.
No time. (coughs)

23:53.910 --> 23:55.112
Grab her.

23:56.582 --> 23:58.853
Don't! Stop!

23:58.953 --> 24:01.057
-Stay away, stay away.
-(screaming)

24:01.157 --> 24:02.727
Dana! Dana!

24:02.827 --> 24:05.065
TOM: Get her over there
so she'll shut up!

24:06.802 --> 24:09.006
-Margaret. Calm down!
-No! No!

24:09.140 --> 24:11.010
You're okay. It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

24:11.277 --> 24:12.881
DR. WEST: Hold him down.

24:13.315 --> 24:15.987
(sobbing)

24:18.024 --> 24:20.797
CHARLES: Stop it now!
Stop it. Stop it.

24:20.897 --> 24:23.569
My baby. My baby.

24:23.669 --> 24:25.973
(screaming)

24:26.642 --> 24:29.480
DR. WEST: I am sorry,
but please hold her down.

24:29.581 --> 24:32.152
Hold her down.
Hold her there.

24:33.756 --> 24:37.864
Murder! Murder! Murder!

24:39.568 --> 24:41.739
-Look at me.
-RUFUS: Mommy.

24:43.910 --> 24:45.646
DR. WEST:
Swallow, Mrs. Weylin.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.690
Swallow.

24:56.267 --> 24:58.572
DR. WEST: The longer you
squirm the longer it's gonna
take.

24:58.672 --> 25:00.743
Here, Rufus. Hold my hand.
Hard as you can.

25:00.877 --> 25:03.214
-(bone cracking)
-(Rufus screaming in pain)

25:03.314 --> 25:04.818
(groaning)

25:04.918 --> 25:11.865
(Rufus screaming)

25:11.965 --> 25:14.170
DR. WEST: That's it, that's
it. Hold his arm.

25:14.270 --> 25:16.140
Now, you over
there. Come here.

25:16.240 --> 25:18.178
Hey, hold him still.

25:18.278 --> 25:19.714
(Rufus screaming)

25:19.814 --> 25:23.989
(Rufus screaming distantly)

25:29.300 --> 25:33.308
(Rufus screaming distantly)

25:33.408 --> 25:35.847
You-- You have a lovely home.

25:35.947 --> 25:38.986
(Rufus screaming)

25:39.621 --> 25:42.594
There is supposed
to be a party.

25:43.061 --> 25:44.163
What, tonight?

25:44.263 --> 25:46.134
No, tomorrow.

25:46.234 --> 25:47.871
It's ruined.

25:49.073 --> 25:51.912
The Christmas feast.

25:52.012 --> 25:55.152
Rufus and I were to do
a little dance together.

25:55.252 --> 25:56.755
A minuet.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.126
-It's Christmas Eve?
-MARGARET: Almost.

26:00.062 --> 26:02.065
I know it's silly.

26:03.368 --> 26:04.738
Who celebrates Christmas?

26:04.838 --> 26:07.075
But I thought it would be

26:07.209 --> 26:09.815
worth doing something cheerful
around here.

26:09.915 --> 26:14.758
-(Margaret sighing)
-(Rufus screaming distantly)

26:14.858 --> 26:17.162
The minister
will be so disappointed.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.711
(Rufus screaming distantly)

26:27.449 --> 26:31.090
(Rufus screaming distantly)

26:46.254 --> 26:50.930
(Rufus screaming distantly)

26:56.274 --> 26:58.879
(melodic piano music)

27:01.752 --> 27:05.726
(Rufus screaming distantly)

27:07.129 --> 27:08.331
(piano music stops)

27:08.431 --> 27:10.402
(screaming and crying stops)

27:10.670 --> 27:13.742
Oh. He's fainted.

27:14.410 --> 27:16.682
Good.

27:21.024 --> 27:22.292
Go on.

27:22.727 --> 27:25.298
(melodic piano music resumes)

27:30.042 --> 27:31.712
TOM: I understand, Septimus,

27:31.812 --> 27:33.983
but I simply don't have access
to any funds.

27:34.083 --> 27:37.155
I was told the boy had
explained that when he called
on you.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.694
DR WEST:
Well, he absolutely did not.

27:40.162 --> 27:42.299
And I must point out that
this weather has made this

27:42.399 --> 27:45.907
a truly dangerous call.
I ought to charge you double.

27:48.311 --> 27:51.450
Perhaps you are
amenable to exchange.

27:51.551 --> 27:53.054
Hmm?

27:53.154 --> 27:55.125
I know you are
a man of science,

27:55.225 --> 27:59.066
and I have a slave with the
most peculiar ailment of the
foot,

27:59.166 --> 28:03.007
which might be
of benefit to your studies.

28:03.809 --> 28:05.078
Say more.

28:05.178 --> 28:06.748
Come.

28:07.416 --> 28:11.324
RUFUS: Dana. Is it over?

28:11.424 --> 28:16.133
DANA: Yeah. It's over.

28:19.473 --> 28:21.912
How do you know my name?

28:22.012 --> 28:24.283
I heard him calling you that.

28:25.218 --> 28:26.487
Who?

28:26.588 --> 28:31.163
That man you came with.
Is he here?

28:31.498 --> 28:33.502
He is.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.042
I saw him drag
me through that empty room,

28:38.378 --> 28:40.783
dragging you to the door.

28:41.985 --> 28:44.056
You were screaming.

28:45.258 --> 28:46.895
Is he your master?

28:46.995 --> 28:49.768
No. He's a friend.

28:49.868 --> 28:52.774
- Was he hurting you?
- DANA: No.

28:53.909 --> 28:56.782
-Oh.
-When did you see this, Rufus?

28:57.449 --> 28:59.219
- How?
- In my head.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.992
As I was falling.

29:05.933 --> 29:08.338
Are you going to
leave me again?

29:09.440 --> 29:12.379
No. No.

29:17.322 --> 29:20.061
(Kevin playing "Fur Elise"
by Ludwig van Beethoven)

29:31.150 --> 29:34.289
Now, now Sabina, you won't
be going very far. Only to
town.

29:34.423 --> 29:36.093
And Dr. West here
will make sure

29:36.193 --> 29:38.164
you're able to come visit
whenever is convenient.

29:38.298 --> 29:41.037
-Isn't that right, Doctor?
-That's right.

29:41.137 --> 29:44.911
Alright, now hurry along
before the roads become
impassable.

29:46.515 --> 29:48.184
DR. WEST:
So long, Weylin.

30:04.450 --> 30:08.257
♪♪♪

30:28.398 --> 30:29.868
(music abruptly stops)

30:29.968 --> 30:33.174
Oh, sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

30:33.274 --> 30:35.011
No.

30:35.111 --> 30:38.484
You seem quite proficient.

30:38.585 --> 30:41.190
(chuckling)
Thank you.

30:41.290 --> 30:44.463
That piano hasn't been
touched in over a decade.

30:44.564 --> 30:46.501
You a musician?

30:46.601 --> 30:49.574
Um, yeah--
Yes, that's right.

30:49.674 --> 30:52.079
- A traveling musician.
- Hmm.

30:52.179 --> 30:54.249
And your instruments?

30:55.418 --> 30:57.055
Bandits.

30:57.991 --> 31:00.328
(clears throat)
Well...

31:00.997 --> 31:03.969
I want to thank you
for your assistance earlier.

31:05.038 --> 31:06.608
I know that
wasn't a pleasant scene.

31:06.708 --> 31:11.050
And I appreciate
your discretion.

31:12.119 --> 31:15.960
Please join me for supper.

31:17.429 --> 31:22.272
- RUFUS: You can read?
- Yes, I can.

31:24.076 --> 31:27.149
Where you come
from, it's fine?

31:27.283 --> 31:29.019
It is.

31:34.129 --> 31:36.200
If daddy catches
a servant looking in a book,

31:36.300 --> 31:39.239
even if they're
just looking at the pictures,

31:39.339 --> 31:43.414
they get be-treed the same as
if you had stolen something.

31:43.515 --> 31:46.153
Well, your daddy
doesn't tell me what to do.

31:49.628 --> 31:51.397
(Dana chuckles)

31:52.700 --> 31:56.006
- Will you read to me?
-Yeah.

32:01.585 --> 32:03.555
"The author of these travels,

32:03.655 --> 32:08.699
"Mr. Lemuel Gulliver,
is my ancient friend.

32:08.799 --> 32:10.703
"There is likewise
some relation between us

32:10.837 --> 32:13.141
-"by the mother's side--"
-MARGARET: What is this?

32:15.178 --> 32:17.650
RUFUS: I asked her
to read to me, Momma.

32:17.750 --> 32:21.157
Where she come from,
it's allowed.

32:26.334 --> 32:30.008
Are you comfortable?
Does your leg hurt?

32:30.108 --> 32:31.410
I feel all right, Momma.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.418
Well, go on.

32:46.107 --> 32:50.315
Uh... "About three years ago,
Mr. Gulliver,

32:50.415 --> 32:53.087
"growing weary of the
concourse of curious people
coming to--"

32:53.187 --> 32:54.423
MARGARET: Baby, are you hot?

32:54.524 --> 32:56.761
Want me get Carrie
up here to fan you?

32:57.295 --> 32:59.734
-I'm all right, Momma.
-MARGARET: Are you hungry,
baby?

32:59.834 --> 33:01.571
'Cause Aunt Sarah
just made a cake.

33:01.671 --> 33:03.107
Wouldn't you like a piece?

33:03.241 --> 33:05.245
I don't want no cake, Momma.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.750
MARGARET: Are you sure?

33:07.850 --> 33:10.723
You ought to see the fine
white icing she put on it.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.361
I want to hear Dana read.
That's all.

33:16.167 --> 33:17.335
Well, why don't you go on?

33:17.435 --> 33:19.373
You're supposed to read.
So read.

33:23.247 --> 33:25.451
"Yet I have heard him say
his family came from--"

33:25.552 --> 33:27.790
MARGARET: I don't know why
you like listening to her.

33:27.924 --> 33:30.061
She's got a voice
like a fly buzzing.

33:30.161 --> 33:31.598
I can't hear her
with you talking.

33:31.698 --> 33:34.269
-MARGARET: All I said, baby--
-Don't say nothin', Momma.

33:34.369 --> 33:36.407
Go away and stop bothering me.

33:36.508 --> 33:38.779
- Rufus.
- Go!

33:39.013 --> 33:40.683
(Margaret scoffing)

33:40.783 --> 33:42.485
How can you treat me this way?

33:43.689 --> 33:46.093
Just 'cause of some nigger.

33:52.674 --> 33:54.544
I get so tired
of her sometimes.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.650
Don't worry about it.

33:57.750 --> 34:00.488
She'll be back after a while
to get me a piece of cake

34:00.589 --> 34:02.560
with fine white icing.

34:04.898 --> 34:07.135
Read Dana.

34:15.318 --> 34:17.455
"Before he quitted Redriff,

34:17.556 --> 34:20.295
"he left the custody
of the following papers in..."

34:26.575 --> 34:28.177
Is, uh, Dana?

34:28.277 --> 34:30.582
Yeah.
She's upstairs with the boy.

34:31.718 --> 34:33.387
He seems to be
quite taken with her.

34:33.487 --> 34:36.126
Yeah, she,
she is good with children.

34:36.226 --> 34:37.830
Let's make sure
she's taken care of.

34:37.930 --> 34:39.567
Bring Mr. Franklin's servant

34:39.667 --> 34:43.140
a warm bowl of whatever mush
it is Sarah's serving.

34:44.744 --> 34:47.616
I'll say, by my measure,
you're already better company

34:47.716 --> 34:49.419
than the man this meal
was meant for.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.292
Was that
the gentleman from earlier?

34:53.194 --> 34:54.530
Charles Broadus.

34:54.630 --> 34:57.335
What a pain in my ass.

34:57.469 --> 34:58.605
Yeah.

34:58.739 --> 35:01.276
He just happens to own
the 100-and-some acres

35:01.376 --> 35:03.214
one lot over from here.

35:04.249 --> 35:05.586
He's moving back to England,

35:05.686 --> 35:08.224
and I need him to sell
to me before he goes

35:08.358 --> 35:11.564
or else I'm going to have
issues with some of my
neighbors.

35:11.664 --> 35:16.173
But this rogue
is an absolute enigma.

35:16.708 --> 35:19.379
And I can't seem
to relate with such a...

35:19.479 --> 35:21.785
an effeminate peahen of a man.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.427
You a family man, Mr.
Franklin? Hmm?

35:26.528 --> 35:28.431
Perhaps a wife
awaits you somewhere?

35:28.532 --> 35:30.736
(chuckling)
No, not yet.

35:30.836 --> 35:32.707
At your age?

35:32.807 --> 35:35.178
Well, um, yeah, there were--

35:35.278 --> 35:38.785
there was someone,
but she, uh, died.

35:43.529 --> 35:45.264
Yes.

35:45.799 --> 35:50.642
I'm familiar with
that special breed of hurt.

35:52.847 --> 35:54.684
My first wife, Hannah.

35:55.118 --> 35:57.222
She suffered from
Boulogne Fever,

35:57.322 --> 35:59.794
which swept through here
some 15 years ago.

36:00.996 --> 36:04.504
It also took her father,
some of my servants.

36:06.006 --> 36:09.346
Yeah, it was very nasty.

36:11.350 --> 36:13.287
Yeah, there's not
a day that passes

36:13.387 --> 36:14.891
where she doesn't
come to mind.

36:14.991 --> 36:16.761
Mm-hmm.

36:17.329 --> 36:20.502
She was a very talented
musician like yourself.

36:21.437 --> 36:24.242
That was her piano
you were playing earlier.

36:24.777 --> 36:26.380
Her music, too.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.983
Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry.

36:28.117 --> 36:29.687
No, don't be.

36:32.058 --> 36:34.497
Now, see here,

36:35.566 --> 36:36.935
I am horrified
at the treatment

36:37.035 --> 36:38.638
you received at the hands
of those bandits.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.709
It's one thing to be fleeced
of one's belongings,

36:40.843 --> 36:43.280
but to be robbed
of one's livelihood,

36:43.380 --> 36:44.650
that's another thing
altogether.

36:44.750 --> 36:46.453
Why don't you stay here
with us, hmm?

36:46.554 --> 36:48.324
For another day or two.

36:48.424 --> 36:50.562
I'll inquire as to whether
or not these thieves

36:50.662 --> 36:52.833
might be tracked down
and your things recovered.

36:52.933 --> 36:55.539
I can't imagine they've gotten
far with such a haul.

36:55.639 --> 37:00.682
In the meantime, consider
yourself a guest in my home.

37:03.421 --> 37:04.757
Thank you.

37:09.466 --> 37:12.372
"We found ourselves
in the latitude of 38

37:12.472 --> 37:13.975
"Two minutes south.

37:14.075 --> 37:18.552
"12 of our crew were dead by
immoderate labor and ill food.

37:18.652 --> 37:21.524
"The rest were
in a very weak condition."

37:32.379 --> 37:34.449
-(door squeaks)
-Who wants cake?

37:41.731 --> 37:43.300
You are dismissed.

38:04.644 --> 38:07.315
KEVIN: So he's somehow
what's bringing you here?

38:07.415 --> 38:09.720
Somehow he can see me
before I come back here.

38:11.691 --> 38:14.564
He saw you in the kitchen.
You and me.

38:14.664 --> 38:17.636
And I can...

38:18.304 --> 38:21.376
I can kind of see him too,
like, I can feel him.

38:21.476 --> 38:23.047
I can feel
what's happening to him.

38:23.147 --> 38:24.851
So what's the plan here?

38:24.951 --> 38:29.059
I mean, it's been hours, Dana,
we've been here for hours.

38:29.159 --> 38:30.896
Are we really
supposed to stay here?

38:30.996 --> 38:32.800
I don't know what else to do.

38:33.334 --> 38:34.770
I can't control it.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.641
There's gotta
be some sort of solution.

38:36.741 --> 38:38.410
If anyone has it,
it's my mother.

38:38.511 --> 38:40.081
She's the only person
that would know.

38:40.215 --> 38:42.018
And-- and I...

38:42.587 --> 38:45.491
We just have to stick it out
until we can get to her.

38:47.563 --> 38:49.534
How have you
been holding up here?

38:52.105 --> 38:54.510
I--I couldn't even tell you.

38:59.721 --> 39:01.824
I had some luck
playing piano earlier.

39:01.924 --> 39:03.662
That passed the time.

39:03.762 --> 39:05.933
-That was you?
-KEVIN: Yeah.

39:07.435 --> 39:10.642
It's how I used to
distract myself as a kid.

39:14.984 --> 39:16.521
Aren't you hungry?

39:17.122 --> 39:18.858
Mmm-mmm. Exhausted.

39:20.596 --> 39:23.400
Hmm. It is 6:00 a.m. for us.

39:24.002 --> 39:25.572
(knocking)

39:28.979 --> 39:30.849
Good evening, Mr. Franklin.

39:30.949 --> 39:32.418
Good evening.

39:32.519 --> 39:34.389
I just wanted to come

39:34.489 --> 39:37.428
and personally apologize
for my behavior earlier.

39:37.529 --> 39:41.571
And thank you for the care
you took for me,

39:41.671 --> 39:43.140
as well as my son.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.013
You can imagine
how difficult it must be

39:46.147 --> 39:48.117
to see your child in danger.

39:48.217 --> 39:50.488
It was no problem.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.697
Are you ready to retire?

39:54.797 --> 39:56.968
I'd be happy to escort you
to your lodgings.

39:58.505 --> 40:01.978
Uh... Oh, I'd
rather stay here.

40:02.078 --> 40:03.615
Thank you.

40:04.917 --> 40:08.023
I believe
it's what my master wants.

40:08.123 --> 40:10.027
That's right.

40:10.161 --> 40:11.965
I can sleep on the floor.

40:12.065 --> 40:13.768
I understand, Mr. Franklin,

40:13.868 --> 40:16.173
but, unfortunately,
we really must insist

40:16.273 --> 40:18.712
on slaves sleeping
in their own quarters.

40:18.812 --> 40:20.582
But don't worry,
we have very fine

40:20.682 --> 40:23.053
-accommodations waiting for
her. -I really must insist.

40:23.187 --> 40:24.890
If you require
her for anything,

40:24.990 --> 40:27.428
simply ring the bell
at your bedside

40:27.529 --> 40:29.132
and she should be able
to comply.

40:29.232 --> 40:32.640
The room in which she sleeps
is merely the one above this
one.

40:40.054 --> 40:42.760
(whispers) Stay up,
I'll come back as soon as I
can.

40:48.137 --> 40:50.776
I assure you,
she'll be most comfortable.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.527
