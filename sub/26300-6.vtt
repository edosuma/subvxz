A music and multimedia festival.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.880
Mateo asked me to come
on as a consultant.

00:07.930 --> 00:09.506
You're stealing money

00:12.380 --> 00:13.760
Now let me out of this place!

How did Mateo figure

00:25.680 --> 00:26.760
I trusted you.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.076
It's time to
renegotiate my deal.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.620
You got that look in your eyes;
yeah, I'm here for that, too.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.300
Who is this girl that got
you all in your feelings?

09:19.320 --> 09:21.660
Who said that there's a her?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.330
I mean, you sitting here

09:23.340 --> 09:25.710
with the lights all dim and
this butter-smooth music

09:25.730 --> 09:27.300
like you D'Angelo or somebody.

09:27.370 --> 09:29.400
Got to be something.

09:30.550 --> 09:33.720
All right, I'm-I'm
seeing this girl.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.320
What's the hesitation?

09:35.390 --> 09:37.710
And I ain't supposed to be
dating this soon in my sobriety.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.999
You put too much on your plate,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.519
you gonna break the
whole damn table.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.060
But how do you control it?

09:42.130 --> 09:45.730
Relationships, they find you.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.070
You don't find them.

09:48.140 --> 09:50.900
Yeah, well.

09:52.340 --> 09:55.000
To be fair, I don't think I
could handle another loss.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.210
Then don't speak
it into existence.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.550
You sound like my pops.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.420
Yeah.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.120
Gay minds think alike.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.960
Girl, I know that smile.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.900
You having a thot process.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.040
- Stop it, bitch.
- So you in a relationship

10:18.060 --> 10:19.370
and you ain't broadcasting?

10:19.430 --> 10:22.600
- Bitch, it's so complicated.
- Run me the tea.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.210
Girl, why this man related
to one of my friends?

10:26.270 --> 10:28.040
And I ain't trying to
get caught in no mess.

10:28.110 --> 10:31.310
Mm-mm. No, you got to tell
your friend the truth.

10:31.350 --> 10:32.760
'Cause, girl, secrets
destroy everything.

10:32.780 --> 10:34.640
Look at what it did
to my damn family.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.940
What, is it about
your Auntie Cassie?

10:39.090 --> 10:40.650
'Cause she called me and told me

10:40.660 --> 10:42.820
you ain't been in the club
in weeks or called her back.

10:42.860 --> 10:45.440
Ain't nothing. I
just miss my mama.

10:45.470 --> 10:48.090
Yeah. I understand that.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.600
But maybe you should
call her back.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.820
For the bitch to call
my phone, and she know

10:51.840 --> 10:53.400
I'm not using her right now,

10:53.440 --> 10:54.800
she must really be worried.

10:54.870 --> 10:58.170
Just call her back. You
know she loves you.

10:59.100 --> 11:02.760
_

11:04.980 --> 11:07.310
So...

11:07.460 --> 11:11.180
Principal Sportswear is
thinking about dropping me

11:11.250 --> 11:13.860
because of this damn sex tape.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.120
I'm sorry.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.430
Well, don't be.

11:19.490 --> 11:21.820
I'm sick of sitting around
waiting for another damn thing

11:21.830 --> 11:22.890
to happen to me.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.276
See, that's what I
was saying, like,

11:24.300 --> 11:26.060
you got to put
yourself in front...

11:26.080 --> 11:29.480
I know. Which is why I
called Mateo this morning.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.330
I'm thinking about
shooting digital content

11:31.340 --> 11:33.040
of my life behind the music.

11:33.140 --> 11:34.870
Wait, so you actually
want to get on camera?

11:34.940 --> 11:38.380
I just feel like I lost myself
with everything that's going on.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.250
And the only way
to get that back

11:40.320 --> 11:42.950
is if I put myself out there.

11:42.980 --> 11:44.380
Even if I hate it.

11:48.190 --> 11:51.060
I'm gonna go lay down.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.200
Hello?

12:05.910 --> 12:08.340
Yeah, I was just about to call you.
Yeah.

12:08.410 --> 12:09.980
I can still meet.

12:11.610 --> 12:12.780
What time?

12:15.520 --> 12:17.950
If this isn't about business,
I got nothing to say to you.

12:18.020 --> 12:19.719
Mateo and the investors,

12:19.720 --> 12:20.859
they're looking to save money.

12:20.860 --> 12:22.780
They're-they're
cutting Black Ivy.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.840
Damn.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.470
Well, there's got to be
some way that we can

12:27.480 --> 12:29.660
get this movie back
on track, I mean...

12:29.730 --> 12:32.120
Well, right now, one of
the hottest commodities

12:32.130 --> 12:34.820
that we can exploit is...

12:35.860 --> 12:38.139
- Jackson?
- I mean, he's got a huge IG following,

12:38.140 --> 12:40.170
looks like Channing Tatum,
and he's cheap as dirt.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.640
We could shoot a trailer of
the last scene in the movie,

12:42.660 --> 12:45.650
influence investors to at least
keep this project alive.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.079
So, you guys want me to
do a lovemaking scene

12:49.080 --> 12:50.520
with my sister's baby daddy?

12:51.800 --> 12:54.120
You're right. You're right.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.620
I don't... What was I thinking?

12:56.900 --> 12:59.230
No, no, it's...

12:59.290 --> 13:01.940
Look, it's fine. I'll do it.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.270
Purple orchids for Megan Jetter.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.700
Yeah, same-same address as yesterday.
Thanks.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.550
Get out of that damn chair

13:13.580 --> 13:15.040
before I snatch
your black ass up!

13:15.110 --> 13:17.740
- What now, Cassie?
- Where's the wire, snitch?

13:17.810 --> 13:19.410
I know you been
talking to the cops.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.220
Yo, you're tripping.
You legit, right?

13:23.820 --> 13:25.330
How is this partnership
gonna work

13:25.340 --> 13:27.250
when I can't even
trust you, Maurice?

13:27.320 --> 13:28.700
You're talking about trust,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.520
and you're up in here
looking for wires?

13:30.590 --> 13:31.790
Well, at least I keep my word,

13:31.860 --> 13:33.430
unlike your shady
ass, backdooring

13:33.440 --> 13:34.940
- to get my sister's job.
- Wait a minute.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.979
You came out trying to
steal Carlotta's clients,

13:36.980 --> 13:38.860
now you're judging me
for finishing the job?

13:38.930 --> 13:41.270
That's my sister, I can do that.

13:41.340 --> 13:44.459
I just got put in charge of
saving Carlotta's R&B fest.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.240
- You know what that means?
- No.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.739
It means I'm one step closer

13:47.740 --> 13:49.780
to building my music empire.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.940
<i>Our</i> empire.

13:55.050 --> 13:57.020
Well, that name's taken anyway.

13:57.090 --> 13:59.290
Now, you done
searching me, boss?

14:01.890 --> 14:03.080
For now.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.460
So, you're going full
Kardashian on me now?

14:07.580 --> 14:10.750
Uh, no. I refuse to be
another ratchet black girl

14:10.780 --> 14:12.180
on reality TV, okay?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.720
I'm just trying to
wrap my head around

14:13.770 --> 14:15.470
getting in front
of a camera again.

14:15.540 --> 14:17.800
Well, if you really
want people to tune in,

14:17.870 --> 14:20.270
I suggest getting E.P. in there.

14:20.340 --> 14:22.419
What are you... what
are you talking about?

14:22.420 --> 14:23.879
What's E.P.?

14:23.880 --> 14:26.880
Uh, she hasn't been
online for a while, Star.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.780
Oh. You don't know?

14:28.820 --> 14:31.750
Social media has named your
boyfriend "Brotha Eggplant."

14:31.820 --> 14:34.280
Nice.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.380
I'm-I'm done.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.770
- I hate the Internet. Officially.
- Well,

14:38.780 --> 14:40.730
it's not going
nowhere, so use it.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.900
Lean into it, like I did
with my baby daddy drama.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.800
- It worked.
- Did it?

14:45.870 --> 14:48.500
Yeah, um, speaking
of, like, eggplants

14:48.570 --> 14:50.470
and baby daddies and all, uh...

14:50.510 --> 14:53.570
I just wanted to let
you know that...

14:53.640 --> 14:56.259
Jackson's gonna be in the movie,

14:56.260 --> 14:58.249
and I have to kiss him.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.180
Oh. That's awkward.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.180
Jackson's gonna be in the movie?

15:02.300 --> 15:04.440
Trust me, I really
don't want to do this.

15:04.480 --> 15:06.950
Baby, I could care less.
I'm just mad because

15:06.980 --> 15:08.820
I've been working my
ass off every day,

15:08.890 --> 15:11.370
and this dude shoots to the
top because a condom broke?

15:11.380 --> 15:12.430
Mm-hmm. Yep.

15:12.490 --> 15:13.930
You want to know
what that's called?

15:13.940 --> 15:16.160
- What?
- White male privilege.

15:16.220 --> 15:19.080
- Okay.
- Oh...

15:19.280 --> 15:22.000
- That was... that was crazy.
- In the flesh.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.800
Man, you guys are gonna
be, like, sharing saliva.

15:24.870 --> 15:26.910
- That's weird.
- I'm gonna barf.

15:26.970 --> 15:29.440
Ladies, have a seat.

15:32.810 --> 15:36.470
So, your "Dump Dini" hashtag
actually gained some traction.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.850
- Oh, you're welcome.
- That was the plan.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.720
Yeah, but we can't have
all this bad press,

15:40.790 --> 15:41.836
so y'all got to squash this beef

15:41.860 --> 15:43.436
so we can get this
festival back on track.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.220
Oh, okay. Squash the beef.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.140
I'm not trying to
ruin the festival.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.360
Okay, Maurice has explained
to me that it's going to help

15:50.400 --> 15:53.219
both of our careers, you
know, if we work together.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.820
So, let's call a truce.
I'm sorry.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.700
I shouldn't have came
in hot like that.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.376
Is that all you got, is that
the end of your speech?

16:01.400 --> 16:02.700
That's what we came here for?

16:02.720 --> 16:04.226
I mean, what, you want
me to change who I am?

16:04.250 --> 16:06.279
That would be great, starting
with the Christmas tree tattoo

16:06.280 --> 16:07.420
on the side of your face.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.970
- That's disrespect.
- Look,

16:08.980 --> 16:10.780
if you want to be a
part of this festival,

16:10.820 --> 16:12.400
you can't treat women like dogs.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.300
- Period.
- And call yourself a pimp,

16:14.320 --> 16:15.890
and promote violence
against women.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.400
I'm not promo... First of all,

16:17.420 --> 16:19.879
that's your definition of
the word "pimp." Pimping.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.930
My-my version, okay, it's
just somebody that comes in

16:22.960 --> 16:24.600
and manipulates the situation,

16:24.670 --> 16:26.700
and then helps it to
work out in their favor.

16:26.770 --> 16:29.500
But you can't change the
definition of a word.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.340
And I can't unwrite
my songs, either.

16:31.410 --> 16:32.570
So what do you want me to do?

16:32.610 --> 16:34.990
What I'd like for you to
do is take that apology

16:35.000 --> 16:37.020
that you just gave us, and
give it to your mother,

16:37.040 --> 16:39.359
who deserves it, 'cause we
don't need this. Boy, bye.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.210
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.570
Lil Dini, look, if you
want to be a part of this,

16:43.580 --> 16:45.180
you got to come correct.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.700
Come on, bro.

16:46.740 --> 16:50.540
I do want to be a part
of this, so I'm sorry,

16:50.610 --> 16:52.840
and I'll put out a statement.

16:54.450 --> 16:56.280
Better be good.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.210
I knew his ass would crack.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.750
Yep. Are we done?

17:10.290 --> 17:13.540
Niece, where you been?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.138
Tied up with Jayden,

17:18.140 --> 17:19.939
and trying to help
out more around here

17:19.940 --> 17:21.069
since Mama's gone.

17:21.140 --> 17:23.609
That's good she's
taking a break.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.920
You know, sometimes when
God wants us to relax,

17:25.960 --> 17:27.839
he slows us down.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.510
God didn't have nothing
to do with this.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.420
Cotton, are you okay?

17:34.490 --> 17:35.919
Is something bothering you?

17:35.920 --> 17:38.360
What happened to you helping
me find my father's killer?

17:38.460 --> 17:39.790
I've been busy at the club.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.620
So, should I maybe figure
it out myself, you think?

17:46.640 --> 17:48.319
No, I think you should
chill and let me figure...

17:48.320 --> 17:51.030
- Auntie Cassie!
- Hey.

17:51.100 --> 17:54.140
Mama's taking me to get pizza.
You should come.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.110
I would, but I got to
get back to the club.

17:56.140 --> 17:57.700
Y'all have a good time, okay?

18:01.400 --> 18:06.700
♪ ♪

18:07.880 --> 18:09.180
What do you think?

18:09.250 --> 18:10.650
Yeah, it's getting there.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.130
- Getting there? Come on.
- It's getting there.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.279
- It's dope. It's the same thing.
- Baby...

18:13.280 --> 18:14.660
It means the same thing.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.840
- I'm not kissing you.
- Why?

18:16.920 --> 18:18.300
'Cause I'm not about
to kiss the same dude

18:18.320 --> 18:20.140
who's kissing my sister.

18:20.210 --> 18:22.380
Well, technically, that
hasn't happened yet.

18:23.550 --> 18:24.720
I still can't believe

18:24.780 --> 18:26.260
they're about to put me
in that movie, though.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.720
Me either.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.820
I got it.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:36.030 --> 18:38.130
- Thanks for coming.
- Oh, no worries.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.830
I was just holed
up in my studio.

18:40.900 --> 18:44.170
It'd be nice to, uh,
try out some new digs.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.340
This place is crazy.
What up, Jackson?

18:47.410 --> 18:49.980
Nothing, man. I
was just leaving.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.340
I got an audition.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.800
Hey, you know, um...

18:53.880 --> 18:55.910
you know I was in that first.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.930
I know what they're looking for,

18:56.940 --> 18:59.650
so if you-you want any
tips, holler at me.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.490
Okay, yeah, that...

19:05.560 --> 19:07.060
that went well.

19:07.130 --> 19:09.200
Are you sure ole boy's
all right with this?

19:09.220 --> 19:10.719
Probably would've helped
if you didn't start with,

19:10.720 --> 19:12.039
"I was up in that first."

19:12.040 --> 19:13.800
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

19:13.870 --> 19:15.900
- Oh, that's messed up.
- Oh, my God.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.660
What'd you think about
the lyrics I sent?

19:17.740 --> 19:20.420
Kind of different from the
boss-bitch stuff, but, um...

19:20.440 --> 19:21.920
- Thanks.
- I like it.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.450
I didn't know pretty boy could
pull out that kind of emotion.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.280
It's not even about him.

19:26.340 --> 19:28.580
- Okay.
- Can you focus?

19:28.650 --> 19:30.460
I mean, I'm just, I'm just
trying to understand, like,

19:30.480 --> 19:31.659
if you're sleeping with somebody

19:31.660 --> 19:32.679
and you're writing love songs,

19:32.680 --> 19:34.850
usually it's about them.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.440
How do you know I'm
sleeping with him?

19:36.500 --> 19:39.700
I-I mean, you know, I don't
know, you know, I...

19:39.720 --> 19:41.620
Pssh. There's no signs at all

19:41.660 --> 19:43.206
- saying anything.
- Oh, my God.

19:43.230 --> 19:45.360
Play it.

19:45.400 --> 19:50.800
♪ ♪

19:51.900 --> 19:54.040
Okay, okay.

19:56.010 --> 19:57.610
- Can I be honest?
- Yep.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.700
Um, I think it could
use a little work.

20:01.250 --> 20:04.250
All right, that's why
you're here; do your magic.

20:04.320 --> 20:05.820
All right.

20:07.990 --> 20:09.990
A go-bag, huh?

20:10.060 --> 20:11.920
I didn't know denial
would look good on you.

20:11.940 --> 20:13.690
I take that thing
everywhere I go.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.060
Leave me alone.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.260
We've all become family,

20:20.320 --> 20:22.130
- almost instantly...
- Hey, babe.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.299
- And that's Derek.
- What's going on?

20:23.300 --> 20:25.360
- No, don't do that.
- Hey, you. Wha...?

20:25.380 --> 20:26.499
No heads-up? No nothing?

20:26.500 --> 20:27.700
You were in the shower.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.470
Uh, give us a minute.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.310
What are, what are you doing?

20:31.340 --> 20:33.020
You know I don't like cameras
in my house like that.

20:33.030 --> 20:34.620
I told you I was gonna do this.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.920
Not in here. Not with me.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.680
Well, where else?

20:38.750 --> 20:41.020
Figure it out. You're trippin'.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.180
<i>I guess this is good-bye.</i>

20:44.320 --> 20:46.439
This isn't good-bye.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.440
I'm not letting you leave.

20:48.490 --> 20:50.830
I don't think I can
stay much longer.

20:50.900 --> 20:54.540
You have to. You
have my heart, Luna.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.619
Wait, you know what,

20:59.620 --> 21:01.139
let's just take that
back for a second

21:01.140 --> 21:03.220
and just... let go.

21:03.260 --> 21:04.940
Just don't think about anything.

21:05.010 --> 21:07.220
Yeah. Let it go. Okay.

21:07.910 --> 21:09.510
You have my heart, Luna.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.199
I'm sorry, I can't.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.199
I just... I know where
his mouth has been.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.496
Well, let's just cut
everything for a second,

21:22.520 --> 21:24.200
and we can just... we can
work on this another time.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.260
Thank you, Jacks.

21:26.060 --> 21:28.200
I can't pitch this garbage
to our investors.

21:28.270 --> 21:30.270
It needs work, okay?

21:30.280 --> 21:32.800
But Black Ivy was supposed to
launch Gravity Indie Film.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.286
We don't have enough
money to go around.

21:34.310 --> 21:35.670
First you gamble our money,

21:35.710 --> 21:37.306
and now you're too afraid
to go to the investors

21:37.330 --> 21:39.940
to fight for my passion project?

21:44.520 --> 21:47.320
You gonna pick the phone up?

21:47.330 --> 21:49.490
It's rang, like, five times.

21:52.290 --> 21:56.090
- Uh, come on, now.
- Oh, who's Megan?

21:56.160 --> 21:59.960
- Who is it?
- Some privacy, please.

22:00.030 --> 22:02.370
All right. So, I got a go-bag,

22:02.380 --> 22:03.970
but at least I'm not
ghosting nobody.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.400
It's called taking
it slow, Star.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.370
All right, I...

22:08.440 --> 22:10.079
I don't want to make
the same mistakes

22:10.080 --> 22:11.480
- I made before.
- Right.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.690
Well, I guess we're messed up

22:13.700 --> 22:14.700
in all the same ways.

22:14.710 --> 22:15.950
No, we're not.

22:15.980 --> 22:17.536
All right? You're pushing
off a relationship

22:17.560 --> 22:19.230
because you're too afraid
it's gonna ruin your career.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.579
It's not about a career.

22:20.580 --> 22:22.120
Then what's it about?

22:22.690 --> 22:24.940
Hey, you're just in time.
We're about to cut vocals.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.210
Actually, I had some
thoughts about the track.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.880
Cool. Uh, Noah made
some adjustments.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.280

They're dope.

I want to talk to you about
the flowers you sent.

want to remember that?

- Noah.
- Don't touch me.

30:45.020 --> 30:46.700
Thank you.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.959
You saw the crowd out there?

30:49.960 --> 30:51.579
I can't believe we got
to share the stage

30:51.580 --> 30:53.660
with this fake Iceberg Slim.

30:57.820 --> 30:59.270
What happened to your face?

30:59.340 --> 31:02.240
- I-I need a drink.
- No, you don't.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.180
Noah.

31:05.460 --> 31:08.150
I'll get you a water, though.

31:13.380 --> 31:16.490
- Let me explain.
- No, no, no.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.560
You ain't got nothing
to say to me.

31:18.570 --> 31:21.060
All right? We good.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.640
Maurice and I lost a child.

31:27.520 --> 31:31.540
Today is the anniversary
of our daughter's death.

31:33.540 --> 31:35.319
He was comforting me

31:35.320 --> 31:37.760
and things sped out of control.

31:37.800 --> 31:42.110
I'm sorry. All right, I...

31:42.180 --> 31:44.380
- I didn't know.
- I thought

31:44.520 --> 31:47.080
I could block out some of
that pain being with you,

31:47.150 --> 31:49.250
but this has...

31:49.320 --> 31:51.560
I get it.

31:51.620 --> 31:52.920
All right, I'm...

31:52.980 --> 31:56.599
I'm just, I'm just
getting sober now

31:56.600 --> 32:00.600
and-and, you know, this
whole Maurice thing

32:00.670 --> 32:01.930
is just too deep for me

32:01.950 --> 32:05.020
- right now to handle it. I...
- I get it. Um...

32:08.710 --> 32:10.870
I'm happy to still act
as your attorney,

32:10.900 --> 32:13.640
or I can refer you
to someone else.

32:21.890 --> 32:24.080
It's Lil Dini in this thing.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.760
I got a brand-new
album coming out.

32:25.790 --> 32:27.860
Make sure y'all cop
the new album.

32:27.930 --> 32:30.360
Show some love, you feel me?

32:30.430 --> 32:32.440
Now what I need y'all
to do is just,

32:32.460 --> 32:34.340
you know, stay in your seats
and show them some love

32:34.360 --> 32:36.920
and remember this
concept: Pimps up!

32:36.980 --> 32:38.840
- Hos down!
- Ay!

32:38.900 --> 32:41.260
A-Town's down, all
right, all right.

32:42.810 --> 32:44.900
'Sup, y'all?

32:44.940 --> 32:46.760
Lil Dini ain't a pimp.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.680
He's from Buckhead.

32:50.020 --> 32:52.360
Born and raised, right?

32:52.790 --> 32:55.590
He's never been shot, he's
never seen anybody dead.

32:55.650 --> 32:59.060
His name is Stephen Pardini.

32:59.130 --> 33:01.340
And Stephen lives with
both his parents.

33:01.360 --> 33:04.260
And Stephen's parents got
a real nice marriage.

35:11.360 --> 35:12.499
You know where the
hell you came from?

35:12.500 --> 35:14.220
- Africa.
- And what they call that?

35:14.240 --> 35:15.470
The fatherland or
the motherland?

35:15.490 --> 35:19.260

Bruce, how did you get all
that dirt on Lil Dini?

35:36.820 --> 35:38.800
Bitch, it pays to have
played with the soundman.

35:38.820 --> 35:41.250
Mm... I'm sorry, what?

35:44.160 --> 35:45.639
You know, the only
way to end a bully

35:45.640 --> 35:47.180
is to gut him like a fish.

35:47.290 --> 35:48.820
And that's what we
did tonight, ladies.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.160
Depends on who the bully is.

35:52.840 --> 35:54.860
_

35:56.000 --> 35:58.100
Ah, Miss Bruce got
some new trade?

35:58.170 --> 35:59.859
Uh, this is more
than trade, bitch,

35:59.860 --> 36:01.139
this is husband material.

36:01.140 --> 36:02.380
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.610
The girls can't take me, honey.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.420
'Cause I got that glow, girl.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.740
You got your
pregnant glow, girl.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.420
Let me get me one.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.550
Okay. I'm-a follow you out.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.839
The camera guy got some
good stuff tonight

36:13.840 --> 36:14.980
for the docuseries.

36:14.990 --> 36:17.020
I think this is all gonna
cut together nicely.

36:17.090 --> 36:18.900
Look at Lil Dini's
face, right there.

36:18.940 --> 36:22.020
Aw, he looks so stupid.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.860
I can't believe you're
gonna have a show.

36:23.900 --> 36:26.660
Just let me be the
Jordyn to your Kylie.

36:26.930 --> 36:28.760
Please.

36:28.800 --> 36:30.339
And what am I?

36:30.340 --> 36:32.860
Stormi, the baby.

36:54.240 --> 36:57.220
You don't deserve to be
in this family anymore.

36:57.400 --> 37:01.100
Look, I'm not the one breaking
family rules, talking to 5-0.

37:01.170 --> 37:04.170
I was trying to figure out
what happened to my father.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.840
What are you looking for?
It's right here.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.670
Move again.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.510
You see, I grew
up without a dad.

37:16.580 --> 37:21.990
Then I got one, and
he accepted me.

37:22.050 --> 37:26.200
He accepted me like
no man ever will.

37:26.990 --> 37:29.660
And you took him from me. You...

37:32.120 --> 37:34.540
Hey, you know what?

37:34.740 --> 37:36.060
Do it.

37:36.340 --> 37:39.660
Pull the trigger. I deserve it.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.990
Just know killing me ain't
gonna make you feel better.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.010
Shut up.

37:43.020 --> 37:44.500
- It's gonna change you.
- Shut up!

37:44.540 --> 37:45.559
It's gonna change you the way

37:45.560 --> 37:47.560
it changed me, Cotton.

37:49.820 --> 37:52.220
I hate you.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.040
I hate myself

37:55.280 --> 37:57.840
for breaking this
whole family apart.

37:58.060 --> 38:01.380
It's like a cycle with us. It
just keeps going and going.

38:01.630 --> 38:05.130
And the only one strong enough

38:05.160 --> 38:08.860
to make it stop and bring us
all back together is you.

38:39.260 --> 38:41.160
I went to the liquor store.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.099
I was just gonna
go home and drink.

38:43.100 --> 38:44.400
Instead I ended up here.

38:48.900 --> 38:51.600
You could never be the
cause of me relapsing.

38:54.010 --> 38:56.840
I'm in a great place with you,

38:56.910 --> 39:00.380
and I'm damn sure not
about to let that go.

39:02.050 --> 39:04.120
Come here.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.060
I'll have to call you back.
All right, great.

39:17.100 --> 39:19.640
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.600
You said you wanted
to see me in person,

39:22.620 --> 39:24.540
so I'm guessing
that it's bad news?

39:24.560 --> 39:28.320
The investors, they're willing
to put the money behind it.

39:28.380 --> 39:31.550
And, I-I'm sorry.

39:31.580 --> 39:34.200
I-I never meant to
betray you, Simone.

39:34.240 --> 39:37.980
I know. You know,
when you told me

39:38.050 --> 39:41.690
that I should imagine kissing
someone that I cared about,

39:41.760 --> 39:44.260
I didn't think about my husband.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.260
I thought about you.

39:47.940 --> 39:51.400
I don't know what
this means, but...

39:51.470 --> 39:55.600
I know that I love
my husband, and...

39:57.880 --> 40:01.340
I have to go.

40:01.410 --> 40:05.080
But congrats.

40:05.220 --> 40:07.580
You, too.

40:07.820 --> 40:11.280
Hey, baby.

40:11.350 --> 40:13.690
I didn't know you
were coming tonight.

40:13.700 --> 40:17.100
Yeah, I did. Had to leave
early, though, but...

40:20.800 --> 40:22.960
- Really, Derek?
- Come on...

40:23.030 --> 40:24.900
Uh, is this payback for
Noah, or something?

40:24.940 --> 40:27.170
- I did not cheat on you.
- No, don't. Don't!

40:28.020 --> 40:30.560
I can't tell you how many times
I heard that growing up.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.720
Before I say the wrong
thing, I'm-a walk outside,

40:34.780 --> 40:36.116
- and you just take a minute.
- No.

40:36.140 --> 40:38.299
- Yes.
- Derek, do not walk out!

40:49.760 --> 40:51.800
Star, do you think I'm
stupid or something?

40:52.620 --> 40:53.840
Huh?

40:53.860 --> 40:55.660
Writing songs about Noah.

40:56.460 --> 40:58.860
That song was not about him.

41:03.970 --> 41:09.100
