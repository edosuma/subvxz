Morning of the big night, Andy?
Are you ready for me to come over?

00:30.121 --> 00:33.372
- Listen, I gotta tell you something--
FANCY: Morning.

00:33.542 --> 00:36.377
- Good morning. How you doing?
FANCY: Fine.

00:36.545 --> 00:41.172
- You won't believe it. I hardly can.
- What, Andy?

00:41.342 --> 00:45.091
I know with our history,
you'll think I made this up--

00:45.263 --> 00:46.840
Andy, what?

00:48.015 --> 00:53.473
Now, an incident has occurred at my
apartment. It's not fit for visitors.

00:53.647 --> 00:55.555
- I don't believe this.
- You wanna know what happened?

00:55.732 --> 00:57.809
- No.
- Hey, John, good morning.

00:57.985 --> 01:01.899
I've heard about fungus
in the fish tank, dangerous tiles--

01:02.113 --> 01:05.318
You want to know what happened?
Yes or no?

01:06.535 --> 01:08.943
What happened?

01:11.666 --> 01:15.877
Well, I have a very bad gas leak.

01:17.421 --> 01:19.545
Now, I called the gas people.

01:19.716 --> 01:24.675
There is no way I'm gonna feel
comfortable exposing you to danger.

01:25.055 --> 01:29.551
- We're back to square one?
- We are definitely not at square one.

01:29.727 --> 01:34.270
I want you to come to my place.
I told you. I turned that corner.

01:34.440 --> 01:39.316
I'm looking forward to it. I'm a
changed man. I have a dangerous leak.

01:39.487 --> 01:42.524
That's all we're talking about
here, now.

01:44.743 --> 01:47.614
You want some advice, Andy?

01:48.372 --> 01:50.280
Get it fixed.

01:50.457 --> 01:51.915
WOMAN:
Mike?

01:52.084 --> 01:54.621
Roberts?

01:54.795 --> 01:58.627
- Mike Roberts around? I gotta see Mike.
DONNA: He's not here.

01:58.799 --> 02:00.175
Mike?

02:00.343 --> 02:02.086
- Hey, Roberts.
- Excuse me.

02:02.261 --> 02:04.717
DEE DEE: Get your ass out here.
- Dee Dee?

02:04.889 --> 02:09.101
- Remember me? Detective Kelly.
- Yeah. I remember you, detective.

02:09.268 --> 02:12.970
KELLY: Come here.
- Should I call Detective Roberts at home?

02:13.148 --> 02:17.359
- You know this isn't cool.
- Maybe Connie, his wife, will answer.

02:17.527 --> 02:21.442
- You gotta do me a really big favor.
- What's that?

02:21.615 --> 02:25.779
Mike promised to get me money.
I can't get in touch with him--

02:25.953 --> 02:30.366
- That's not how this works.
- But if I could borrow $20, I promise--

02:30.541 --> 02:36.330
- I will give him your message.
- I gotta get up. I don't have any money.

02:36.506 --> 02:41.667
- I'm gonna give him your message.
- No. No, no, no. That's not good.

02:41.928 --> 02:46.674
You think I'm only his snitch?
You think that's what I am? I'm not.

02:46.976 --> 02:50.309
I'm his round- the- world girl.
I'm his whore.

02:50.562 --> 02:53.517
- What the hell's going on?
- You got a visitor.

02:55.151 --> 02:57.523
Hi, Mike.

02:57.903 --> 03:02.649
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- I haven't seen you for three days.

03:02.825 --> 03:05.198
Let's call Connie.

03:05.370 --> 03:10.116
Yeah, let's call Connie.
Yeah, you know.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.792
Hi, Connie, this--

03:13.962 --> 03:17.082
SlPOWlCZ: What's wrong with you?
DEE DEE: No, wait.

03:17.257 --> 03:20.045
That's enough!
I want her out of here.

03:20.219 --> 03:22.176
DEE DEE: No, no, wait!
KELLY: She's leaving.

03:22.346 --> 03:25.300
- Roberts, my office!
- Don't blame this on him.

03:25.474 --> 03:28.345
FANCY: Get her out!
- Mike, will I see you later?

04:26.706 --> 04:28.497
Steroid Roy

04:42.556 --> 04:46.340
- You need to be within rules with her.
- I know how that looked.

04:46.561 --> 04:49.016
- I know that looked bad.
- You hear me?

04:49.188 --> 04:53.187
I heard. I'd remind you
this girl made a big case for us.

04:53.485 --> 04:56.236
Let's not forget
she's a good informant.

04:56.404 --> 05:01.743
- You need to be within rules with her.
- Of course I am. You kidding me?

05:01.910 --> 05:03.654
I mean, junkies....

05:03.829 --> 05:07.032
What are you gonna do?
You wanna know the truth?

05:07.207 --> 05:10.873
I think treating her like a person,
the kid's in love.

05:11.045 --> 05:16.881
You know, maybe she's in love with
the possibility of something solid.

05:17.051 --> 05:20.966
I'm what she aspires to,
a role model or something.

05:21.515 --> 05:26.722
Because if you're crossing the line,
then it's you who's messing up.

05:27.604 --> 05:30.096
Yeah. I hear you, lieutenant.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.071
LARSON: Hey, I gotta talk to you.
LlCALSl: Okay.

05:43.329 --> 05:45.785
- What's going on, Janice?
- Nothing.

05:45.957 --> 05:49.658
Then how come the duty roster's
paired me with Sackler?

05:49.919 --> 05:53.123
Because I asked for a new partner.

05:53.298 --> 05:56.502
- If it's because I blew that undercover--
LlCALSl: No.

05:56.676 --> 05:57.875
LARSON:
Then what?

05:58.053 --> 06:03.926
I don't think you are a safe
or reliable partner.

06:05.770 --> 06:09.470
- I can't believe I'm hearing this.
- You want it straight?

06:09.774 --> 06:14.187
- You have a substance abuse problem.
- A what?

06:14.362 --> 06:18.574
Substance abuse? Is that what
your friend Kelly's saying?

06:18.741 --> 06:22.158
Okay, Roy,
why don't we just drop this, okay?

06:22.329 --> 06:26.991
This is not about Kelly.
And the thing I said, maybe I'm wrong.

06:27.168 --> 06:29.457
All I know is that I'd feel...

06:29.670 --> 06:33.419
...more comfortable partnering
with somebody else.

06:33.591 --> 06:36.627
- I can't argue with that.
- No hard feelings?

06:36.803 --> 06:41.015
No.
Look, since we're not gonna partner...

06:41.182 --> 06:46.723
...that clears the way for us
to get together socially.

06:48.565 --> 06:52.231
You really don't get this,
do you, Roy?

06:54.155 --> 06:56.692
Listen to what I'm saying.

06:56.866 --> 07:01.195
I don't wanna have
anything to do with you.

07:08.503 --> 07:09.666
SlPOWlCZ: Hey, Laura.
- Hey.

07:09.838 --> 07:10.869
KELLY: Hey.
- Hey, John.

07:11.047 --> 07:12.922
- How's it going?
- Good. Could you do me a favor?

07:13.091 --> 07:15.084
- Sure.
- On the Garcia homicide...

07:15.260 --> 07:18.879
...could you get statements
on the husband and wife?

07:19.056 --> 07:21.891
- I thought I put three in there.
- You did.

07:22.060 --> 07:26.140
You got three documents of
spousal abuse. A woman confesses...

07:26.314 --> 07:30.691
...she stabbed her husband after
he beat her. Why more statements?

07:30.860 --> 07:35.487
Something isn't right. Her lawyer's
ready to plead manslaughter two.

07:35.823 --> 07:39.407
That's the worst she'd do.
Something's missing.

07:39.577 --> 07:45.414
I don't agree. Before the trial, I'll
reinterview like I do on every case.

07:45.584 --> 07:50.294
- I don't think there'll be a trial.
- Tell your boss you want to go to bat.

07:50.506 --> 07:53.079
I think he'll deal anyway.

07:56.888 --> 07:59.805
So because you won't stand up
to your boss...

07:59.974 --> 08:06.060
...I have to go reinterview for a woman
who admits she stabbed her husband...

08:06.231 --> 08:10.526
- ...and three neighbors say he beat her?
- Yeah, that's what I'm asking--

08:10.694 --> 08:14.479
- Are you asking me or telling me?
- I was asking you.

08:14.656 --> 08:17.693
What are you trying to turn this into?

08:19.328 --> 08:22.661
Okay, gentlemen, could we
put a hold on everything...

08:22.832 --> 08:25.750
...and get statements
on the Garcia homicide...

08:25.918 --> 08:31.376
...so the district attorney is comfortable
presenting the case? Satisfied?

08:31.550 --> 08:34.799
Thanks for being such a prick, Johnny.

08:35.679 --> 08:38.883
- Son of a bitch!
COSTAS: If I got a buck every time...

08:39.058 --> 08:42.344
...a cop tried to get me, I'd be rich.
It's not personal.

08:42.602 --> 08:45.770
- That was personal.
- Well, you stood your ground...

08:45.940 --> 08:48.977
...he acted like an asshole.
What else is new?

08:49.151 --> 08:51.228
Not a thing.

08:52.072 --> 08:57.030
KELLY: Mrs. Dupree, we'd like to come
by and ask you some more questions.

08:57.202 --> 09:00.737
Tomorrow morning.
Can I send the detectives by?

09:00.956 --> 09:04.408
No, Mr. Fuentes,
we wanna talk to both of you.

09:04.585 --> 09:08.333
Well, when will she be off?
Tomorrow morning?

09:08.505 --> 09:11.079
We'll be there before noon.
Thank you.

09:11.259 --> 09:16.216
- Kelly, you're up. Apparent suicide.
- Two- man job, lieutenant?

09:16.389 --> 09:19.059
Yeah, go ahead.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.387
Medavoy...

09:21.561 --> 09:24.977
...we got an apparent, urgent suicide.

09:25.148 --> 09:29.395
I'm gonna have to kiss these
Garcia calls over to you, okay?

09:30.154 --> 09:31.529
Delighted.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.446
SlPOWlCZ: This the only door?
There's no forced entry?

09:36.660 --> 09:41.571
DEVLIN: I'll know once I open her up,
but I'll call it four or five hours.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.833
Oh, man, you know who this is,
don't you?

09:45.170 --> 09:47.245
SlPOWlCZ: Roberts' snitch.
KELLY: Yeah.

09:47.422 --> 09:52.167
SUPER: All the time, I get complaints.
Nothing but trouble.

09:52.343 --> 09:57.255
I get complaint.
Water leaking from the ceiling.

09:57.432 --> 10:01.051
Who pays for this?
I come up. I bang on the door.

10:01.354 --> 10:02.681
Banging, no answer.

10:02.855 --> 10:05.144
SlPOWlCZ:
Wait outside till we're ready.

10:05.316 --> 10:08.317
Why her boyfriend don't tell me?
Water come.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.485
- What boyfriend?
SUPER: Cop guy.

10:10.822 --> 10:15.484
- Cop guy, huh? Cop guy in a uniform?
- No, like you.

10:16.077 --> 10:19.493
- Wonder who that is.
- Would he know about the water?

10:19.706 --> 10:24.001
He was here. I see him leave.
A half- hour later, complaint.

10:24.169 --> 10:27.870
- This cop guy got a name?
- Mike. Mike....

10:28.049 --> 10:32.426
I don't know last name.
Once, they fight. I come ask for quiet.

10:32.595 --> 10:34.837
- He show me his badge.
KELLY: Fight a lot?

10:35.014 --> 10:38.846
SUPER: Few hours before, I hear them.
SlPOWlCZ: Today?

10:39.019 --> 10:44.261
Yes. First he go, then he come. Then
I see him leave again, half- hour later--

10:44.441 --> 10:47.358
I know, the water's coming
down through the ceiling, right?

10:47.527 --> 10:48.986
[DOG BARKS]

10:49.154 --> 10:51.277
SlPOWlCZ: Take it easy.
SUPER: Shut up! Go to pound.

10:51.741 --> 10:56.284
- No. They'll put it down in a pound.
- Down, up. No dog allowed.

10:56.495 --> 10:59.366
- I tell her 20 times!
- I'll take the dog.

10:59.541 --> 11:02.991
The dog's not going to a pound.
You got a green card?

11:03.169 --> 11:07.001
- You want to see?
- No, get out of here. Take off.

11:08.717 --> 11:13.675
SUPER: He's crazy. What that has to do
with my green card? Ridiculous.

11:13.847 --> 11:20.384
- We better go talk to Roberts.
- Let's tell Mike. Like he doesn't know.

11:30.739 --> 11:36.079
Poor kid. I tried to straighten
her out. I mean, I really tried.

11:36.371 --> 11:42.160
- I even prayed for her. You believe it?
- Talk about last night.

11:42.336 --> 11:47.578
I saw her a lot, you know,
maybe too much.

11:47.758 --> 11:52.219
Maybe I even loved her a little,
even, you know, like...

11:52.847 --> 11:58.600
...taking care of her and everything
and making sure she was safe.

11:58.769 --> 12:03.148
- That kind of love, know what I mean?
- Last night, Mike.

12:03.316 --> 12:07.610
ROBERTS: What about it? She died.
- When did you see her last?

12:07.779 --> 12:11.113
Yesterday. I saw her with you guys.
You guys saw.

12:11.450 --> 12:14.155
You didn't see her after that?

12:14.620 --> 12:18.534
Hey, what are we,
gonna go bare knuckles here?

12:18.707 --> 12:23.037
- What do you want me to say?
- Start with the truth.

12:23.212 --> 12:29.132
The super saw you leave her apartment
before water came through the ceiling.

12:29.510 --> 12:33.972
Let me ask you a question.
What question did you just ask me?

12:34.140 --> 12:36.845
What was the question you asked me?

12:37.018 --> 12:39.426
When the last time you saw her was.

12:39.605 --> 12:43.270
I told you the last time
that I saw her alive, right?

12:43.442 --> 12:49.232
- When I saw her after, she was dead.
- Why didn't you call it in then, Mike?

12:51.659 --> 12:56.654
I had a couple of changes of clothes
and shaving stuff in the apartment.

12:56.831 --> 12:59.453
Where's the stuff now?

13:04.297 --> 13:07.050
It's in my locker, John.

13:08.218 --> 13:11.588
Couple of shirts and
some shaving stuff.

13:12.723 --> 13:14.930
Come on, let's go.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.183
SlPOWlCZ: Come on.
KELLY: Let's go take a look.

13:18.354 --> 13:21.355
Beautiful, beautiful.

13:21.857 --> 13:24.610
Great. That's beautiful.

13:25.362 --> 13:28.777
Embarrass me in front
of the department. Great!

13:28.949 --> 13:32.365
- Nobody's gonna embarrass you.
ROBERTS: Yeah, right.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.741
- What's it look like?
- I don't know.

13:40.919 --> 13:44.964
- He deny the super's story?
- Says he was there after she died.

13:45.132 --> 13:47.706
- Only time he was there.
- Believe him?

13:47.927 --> 13:50.762
Says he picked up
his personal effects.

13:50.930 --> 13:54.015
What about the super
saying they fought?

13:54.184 --> 14:00.187
- We're gonna work on that in a minute.
- John, this guy gets zero rhythm. Zero.

14:11.244 --> 14:16.120
Razor, shirts, couple of pictures.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.742
Which would kind of be
what I told you, right?

14:19.919 --> 14:22.209
- You were only there once?
- Right.

14:22.381 --> 14:26.212
- Super says you were there twice.
- Let's break that down.

14:26.385 --> 14:29.220
Super says I was there twice.
He's a liar.

14:29.471 --> 14:34.134
Says he heard fighting. Maybe he did.
She had scumbag friends...

14:34.309 --> 14:38.521
- ...that's why she worked for us.
- We're getting different stories.

14:38.690 --> 14:43.268
You say you were not there before
you went to pick up your stuff?

14:43.444 --> 14:47.656
- Correct, for the second time.
- You altered a crime scene.

14:47.866 --> 14:50.024
You admit lying about it.

14:50.410 --> 14:55.571
Hey, John, don't talk to me
like some street skell here.

14:55.749 --> 14:59.119
You guys want to screw me for this,
you go ahead.

- Yes.
- Detective Medavoy. Detective Martinez.

- Oh, yes. Please come in.

Would you like a cup of coffee?

15:46.094 --> 15:48.301
No, no, no, thanks, Mr. Fuentes.

15:48.472 --> 15:53.134
We just want to go over what you told
the detectives the other day.

15:53.310 --> 15:57.853
- I told those guys everything I know.
- You were home alone?

15:58.023 --> 16:03.315
Right. My wife works afternoons.
I work at night. I'm a cook.

It says here that you were at home,
you could hear Mr. and Mrs. Garcia...

16:08.660 --> 16:12.824
...arguing all day,
then there was a scream.

16:12.998 --> 16:15.324
You ran into the hallway and...

16:15.542 --> 16:19.540
...Mr. Garcia came out of his apartment
with the knife in him...

16:19.713 --> 16:23.663
- ...collapsed in your arms and died.
- Exactly.

16:23.843 --> 16:26.880
And Mrs. Garcia
said she stabbed her husband?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.510
- That's correct.
- You weren't home?

16:29.766 --> 16:33.099
- I was at work.
- Were you friends with Mrs. Garcia?

16:33.269 --> 16:36.389
We didn't socialize.
We keep to ourselves.

16:36.773 --> 16:40.522
What's the problem?
Why are you asking questions again?

16:40.735 --> 16:45.398
- To be sure statements are accurate.
- Everybody knows she stabbed him.

16:45.657 --> 16:48.444
He beat her up, she took her revenge.

16:48.619 --> 16:52.997
- They're gonna lock her up for that?
- That's up to a jury, sir.

16:53.332 --> 16:57.745
But she's behind bars?
She's not getting out, right?

16:57.962 --> 17:00.879
- What kind of bail?
- That's up to the judge.

17:01.049 --> 17:06.922
A woman like that is a danger, like the
one who cut off her husband's dick.

17:07.348 --> 17:11.262
These are the people they lock up
and throw away the key.

17:11.435 --> 17:15.267
That should do it.
Thanks for your time, Mr. Fuentes.

17:15.440 --> 17:17.728
<i>MR. FUENTES: Sure.
- Mrs. Fuentes, gracias. </i>

17:19.527 --> 17:24.521
You'll let us know if she gets out on
bail? Notify us somehow or another?

17:24.699 --> 17:29.361
Yeah, sure, we could do that
if you want. Yeah, sure.

17:29.705 --> 17:33.038
- Anyway, thanks for your cooperation.
- Sure.

17:37.630 --> 17:40.631
SlPOWlCZ: Yeast infection?
How much is that gonna cost?

17:40.800 --> 17:45.177
I spent a month in the hospital,
it didn't cost that much.

17:45.346 --> 17:50.008
How old is this dog, anyway?
You think he's gonna live for a while?

17:50.184 --> 17:51.643
All right, okay.

17:51.811 --> 17:55.679
Is there any chance that this
could be a special dog...

17:55.857 --> 17:59.856
...maybe a purebred, anything?
No, it wouldn't, huh?

18:00.028 --> 18:05.403
All right, well, you got my Visa, go
ahead and treat the dog.

18:07.411 --> 18:11.029
- How we doing on those supplementals?
- Okay.

18:11.206 --> 18:15.750
- Listen, I'm sorry I hung you with that.
- No, forget about it.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.752
Actually, this one witness, Fuentes...

18:19.925 --> 18:23.092
...we both felt that he had more to say,
you know...

18:23.261 --> 18:26.263
...like he was embarrassed
in front of his wife.

18:26.431 --> 18:29.267
- Martinez is calling him up.
KELLY: Wait a minute.

18:29.434 --> 18:32.721
Fuentes. I interviewed the guy.
He seemed okay.

18:32.896 --> 18:37.642
- Yeah? It's probably nothing.
- Well, let me know, okay?

18:37.818 --> 18:40.605
Yeah, sure.

18:42.741 --> 18:45.362
Mr. Fuentes, it's Detective Martinez.

18:45.577 --> 18:50.572
My partner and I got the impression
maybe something was bothering you...

18:50.749 --> 18:54.082
...maybe you felt uncomfortable
talking about it.

18:54.252 --> 19:00.374
We thought you might want to come in
and talk, like, private, man- to- man.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.965
Okay, good.

19:03.137 --> 19:07.349
You work nights, right?
Well, how about tomorrow morning?

19:07.517 --> 19:12.144
Great. All right, just ask for
Detective Martinez or Medavoy.

19:12.355 --> 19:13.730
Beautiful.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.098
He's coming in.

19:23.575 --> 19:25.698
You think Roberts offed her?

19:25.869 --> 19:28.158
He's an asshole. We know that.

19:28.331 --> 19:34.583
Whether he committed a murder?
We'll get the toxicology. We'll find out.

19:36.047 --> 19:38.585
Big night? Sylvia coming over?

19:38.758 --> 19:43.171
You're not going to believe what
happened. I gotta tell you that.

19:43.347 --> 19:46.762
- What are you laughing at?
- Problem with the apartment?

19:46.934 --> 19:49.602
That's an attitude I don't appreciate.

19:49.770 --> 19:54.396
As it turns out, I got an--
I do have a problem at my apartment.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.856
- A gas leak.
- I didn't say anything.

19:57.028 --> 20:00.194
But what's that?
What's that goofy grin for?

20:00.364 --> 20:04.197
What, you think I'd destroy
my own gas installation?

20:04.369 --> 20:07.903
It's gonna get repaired.
It may take a few days...

20:08.123 --> 20:11.539
...but you know the way things are
with utilities.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.922
Hey, the point is, is that I'm ready
for her to come over.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.085
Good. I'm glad to hear it.
Good for you.

20:19.343 --> 20:23.637
Yeah. Great, the Amazing Hulk.

20:25.057 --> 20:28.641
Detective, I owe you an apology.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.726
I shouldn't have gotten in your face.
I was out of line.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.809
- No problem.
- Bygones be bygones?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.147
Yeah.

20:36.361 --> 20:40.774
I was thinking maybe you'd put in a
good word for me with Janice Licalsi.

20:40.949 --> 20:44.069
If she knows we're cool,
she might let me up.

20:44.245 --> 20:49.666
- She put in to ride with someone else.
- I think you need to talk to her about that.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.992
Mm- hm.

20:52.170 --> 20:55.752
Okay, no problem.

20:59.386 --> 21:03.881
Give me 20 minutes a day, I could
get you tightened up in a month.

21:04.057 --> 21:07.141
- I'm tight.
- Your pectorals are okay now...

21:07.352 --> 21:11.730
...but you don't work them,
in 5 years, they'll be at your knees.

21:11.899 --> 21:15.849
- The train's moving on that track.
- What are you, mid- 30s?

21:16.028 --> 21:19.148
No reason for it.
Doesn't have to be that way.

21:19.324 --> 21:22.657
- Thanks for the advice.
- It's not advice, it's fact.

21:22.827 --> 21:28.450
As you get older, everything gets hairier,
wider and closer to the ground.

21:28.625 --> 21:32.124
A few leg lifts, some other techniques,
you avoid...

21:32.295 --> 21:35.296
...an ass that's an embarrassment.

21:45.976 --> 21:47.601
Let me work on him, Roy...

21:47.770 --> 21:54.188
...see if I can get him to come to his
senses. Our bodies are our temples.

21:55.236 --> 21:58.321
What'll it take to drop
a gorilla net on him?

21:58.490 --> 22:02.440
- This guy is on something, Andy.
- My vote is speed.

22:02.619 --> 22:09.369
You wanna sit on a butt like cottage
cheese, be my guest. I'll sit on this.

22:14.841 --> 22:19.752
You got to admit, lieutenant, the
guy's got a hell of a muscular ass.

22:33.819 --> 22:38.196
Hey, detectives?
That's Dee Dee Santini's mother.

22:40.868 --> 22:44.451
- Sorry for your loss, Mrs. Santini.
- My name's McBride.

22:44.622 --> 22:50.127
My daughter's name was Santini. At 1 6,
she married a punk named Santini.

22:50.295 --> 22:54.756
This is my Dolores,
and she'll always be McBride to me.

22:54.925 --> 22:58.792
Let's sit down. Come on, sit down.

23:01.098 --> 23:06.010
- What can we do for you, ma'am?
- I want to show you some things.

23:09.815 --> 23:16.104
This is her high school graduation. She
did excellent in school, the Sisters said.

23:16.280 --> 23:20.279
Got good grades, was in every club.

23:20.452 --> 23:24.616
She was quitting drugs, you know.
She promised our priest.

23:24.790 --> 23:28.076
What else you got there?
Is that a diary?

23:29.128 --> 23:31.701
Do either of you have children?

23:31.880 --> 23:34.337
Yeah, I got a boy.

23:34.509 --> 23:38.043
Are you close to him, detective?

23:38.221 --> 23:41.886
- Not at present.
- Something happens that's not right...

23:42.058 --> 23:44.976
...you know.
You know about your kids.

23:45.145 --> 23:49.938
- Yeah, I guess you do.
- I knew. Even before I read this...

23:50.150 --> 23:55.655
...I knew she was involved with someone
who hurt her, some married bastard.

23:55.823 --> 24:00.651
She tried 20 times
to split up with him, but...

24:00.828 --> 24:04.114
...she was weak because of the drugs.

24:04.290 --> 24:07.244
This time,
she promised Father Kelleher.

24:07.877 --> 24:12.421
She was ready this time,
and this bastard took her chance away.

24:12.591 --> 24:14.500
Can we see this?

24:14.676 --> 24:18.804
MCBRIDE: Here, read this.
It says it right here.

24:18.972 --> 24:22.057
"Mike says if I leave him,
he'll kill me.

24:22.226 --> 24:27.303
He says if I'm going to call his wife
again, he's going to kill me."

24:27.481 --> 24:33.152
She read to me from this.
She gave this to me.

24:33.321 --> 24:37.782
Look, listen.
"I am definitely going to quit drugs.

24:37.951 --> 24:43.372
I am definitely going to change
my life with Father Kelleher's help."

24:43.540 --> 24:47.917
I'm telling you, this son of a bitch
killed her, this Mike.

24:48.086 --> 24:53.164
I begged her to tell me, but she
refused. His last name's not in the book.

24:53.342 --> 24:56.130
This is gonna be very helpful.

24:56.513 --> 25:00.213
So it's not a suicide.
This girl was murdered.

25:00.391 --> 25:05.387
- You read how she was gonna quit drugs?
- Thank you for giving us the diary.

25:05.772 --> 25:09.105
- You have leads?
- Yeah, we're working on things.

25:09.276 --> 25:13.439
You find this Mike.
He murdered my little girl.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.333
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah.

25:27.587 --> 25:32.748
I want you to go over to Health
Services and take a drug test, officer.

25:32.925 --> 25:36.924
- A drug test? What for?
WALLENBECK: For cause.

25:37.263 --> 25:41.262
Lieutenant brought facts
to my attention that warrant it.

25:41.435 --> 25:44.306
- I don't get this.
- You have a problem?

25:44.479 --> 25:47.814
No, sir, absolutely not.
I got nothing to hide.

25:47.984 --> 25:51.602
I would like to know
who's spreading rumors about me.

25:51.779 --> 25:55.528
- No one's spreading rumors.
- Health Services expects you.

25:55.700 --> 25:59.650
- If you got nothing to hide, not to worry.
- Yes, sir.

25:59.830 --> 26:02.831
You know where you're going?
Lefrak City?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.751
Yeah, I know where I'm going.

26:11.676 --> 26:14.047
Hey, Janice.

26:15.430 --> 26:19.510
- You and your boyfriend got me.
- I don't know what you mean.

26:19.684 --> 26:23.349
Well, I got a hot flash for you.
You don't got dick.

26:23.522 --> 26:26.855
I'm gonna ace the drug test
and take the results...

26:27.025 --> 26:31.237
...and shove them up your
chicken- hearted boyfriend's ass.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.525
What did Dee Dee's mother want?

26:38.704 --> 26:42.203
Look, let's talk in the interview room,
all right?

26:42.374 --> 26:47.037
I hope you're not paying attention to
what she says. According to her...

26:47.213 --> 26:50.796
...Dee Dee still had her cherry.
A stone junkie.

26:51.009 --> 26:57.129
She still thought her daughter ran
around in a convent school uniform.

26:57.307 --> 27:01.602
I wish you didn't leave messages
at my house. Connie's worried.

27:01.770 --> 27:04.772
You were down to work.
We tried reaching you.

27:04.940 --> 27:08.689
What are you gonna do?
More"rub Mike's nose in it"?

27:08.861 --> 27:11.732
"How could Roberts mess up
on procedure?"

27:11.906 --> 27:15.156
- Procedure?
- I got overinvolved with a snitch.

27:15.326 --> 27:18.695
It's not a hanging offense,
is it, guys?

27:20.039 --> 27:23.040
Hey, do I need a PBA rep
or a lawyer?

27:23.210 --> 27:28.251
I thought seven years working together
counted for something. It doesn't.

27:31.677 --> 27:34.251
In her diary, you threaten her life.

27:34.429 --> 27:38.843
Said you'd kill her if she calls your wife,
which we heard her threaten.

27:39.018 --> 27:42.850
KELLY: Tell us what happened between
you two before she died.

27:43.023 --> 27:45.976
What are you saying?
You think I killed her?

27:46.151 --> 27:49.318
What she put in a diary
you take above my word?

27:49.488 --> 27:53.106
Everything that happened that day,
Roberts. Now!

27:53.283 --> 27:56.782
- I told you.
- The super says you were there twice.

27:56.954 --> 28:00.074
The super says.
The snitch says in her book.

28:00.249 --> 28:03.749
What about what Roberts says, huh?

28:08.216 --> 28:10.173
All right.

28:13.513 --> 28:18.389
I was there before she died, okay?
Okay?

28:18.560 --> 28:21.845
And I brought her something.

28:22.064 --> 28:25.848
I was desperate to break it off
with this girl.

28:26.026 --> 28:29.727
What happened, Roberts? Now!

28:31.991 --> 28:35.027
I bought her a bag of quinine.

28:35.703 --> 28:39.286
I brought her a beat bag,
looks and tastes like dope.

28:39.457 --> 28:44.701
She's not going to know it's not dope
until after I leave.

28:44.880 --> 28:50.752
I needed to talk to her. I needed
to tell her how things were gonna be.

28:51.970 --> 28:55.055
She wasn't gonna listen to me
unless I did....

28:55.224 --> 28:57.845
Unless I gave her something.

28:58.102 --> 29:02.100
So I gave her the stuff,
told her we were done...

29:02.273 --> 29:05.310
...she freaks out, this and that.

29:06.652 --> 29:09.144
I'm gonna do myself in.

29:11.157 --> 29:15.238
Believe me, for her that was like
going to the crapper.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.325
That's how many times
she threatened that.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.618
And that's it.

29:23.420 --> 29:26.207
I broke it off with her, and I left.

29:27.425 --> 29:30.212
Why did you go back, Mike?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.841
Because I was worried about her.

29:34.265 --> 29:38.643
Because exactly what I was afraid of
actually happened.

29:40.271 --> 29:42.561
I get there...

29:43.692 --> 29:46.064
...she's dead.

29:48.698 --> 29:51.235
The little dog is there.

29:59.458 --> 30:02.663
I used to go over there on Sundays,
you know...

30:02.838 --> 30:05.246
...bring the paper...

30:06.842 --> 30:09.048
...coffee.

30:16.310 --> 30:19.845
I used to bring a bag of bear claws.

30:20.398 --> 30:25.143
That little dog used to beg
in front of me for them bear claws.

30:28.907 --> 30:31.778
I loved that little dog.

30:33.620 --> 30:36.408
I loved that little dog.

30:42.713 --> 30:43.828
[MARTINEZ SPEAKS lN SPANISH]

30:44.006 --> 30:45.963
I'm okay speaking as we are.

30:46.134 --> 30:49.669
MEDAVOY: Mr. Fuentes, when we
came to see you yesterday...

30:49.845 --> 30:53.630
...you seemed nervous
about Mrs. Garcia making her bail.

30:53.809 --> 30:58.269
You told us that you and your wife
don't know her very well.

30:58.439 --> 31:01.060
So, what are you concerned about?

31:01.274 --> 31:04.359
You know her a little better
than you said?

31:04.528 --> 31:08.941
I'll tell you everything, but
you can't use it to incriminate me.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.069
I gotta ask you something.

31:11.243 --> 31:16.369
- Do you want to have a lawyer here?
- No lawyer. I didn't do nothing wrong.

31:17.667 --> 31:21.166
Why don't you tell us
what's on your mind?

31:23.632 --> 31:27.676
- I had relations with Mrs. Garcia.
- What kind of relations?

31:27.845 --> 31:31.925
You know, intimate, virile.

31:32.183 --> 31:35.552
I couldn't help it.
She fell in love with me.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.768
Her husband worked all day.

31:37.938 --> 31:40.975
He'd come home at night,
drink, beat her.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.226
<i>Coño,  you know, she has needs.</i>

31:43.445 --> 31:46.446
You're home during the day,
work at night.

31:46.615 --> 31:49.568
My wife's a good woman. I love her.

31:49.743 --> 31:55.746
<i>But Luisa Garcia estaba bien caliente.
It was a passionate affair.</i>

31:55.916 --> 31:59.119
I knew it was wrong.
What am I supposed to do?

31:59.294 --> 32:04.752
Said she'd kill her husband, I should
kill my wife so we could live together.

32:04.926 --> 32:08.295
I just let it go.
I thought it was talk.

<i>The next thing you know, lo mató,
Mr. Garcia is dead.</i>

32:12.684 --> 32:14.511
She did it. Son of a bitch.

32:14.894 --> 32:19.556
But I'm still thinking that she did it
because he was beating her.

32:19.733 --> 32:23.777
- This is when I talked to your detective.
- Detective Kelly.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.484
Yeah, yeah.

32:27.950 --> 32:31.782
Then she gives me a call
three days ago.

32:31.954 --> 32:34.161
She calls me from prison, right?

32:34.332 --> 32:37.997
"I did my part," she says.
"Now you gonna do yours."

32:38.211 --> 32:42.161
That's why I was upset
when you came over.

32:42.424 --> 32:44.915
Now I realize that she's crazy.

32:45.093 --> 32:49.305
She says she murdered him
so we can live together forever.

32:49.473 --> 32:52.759
- Your wife knows nothing about this?
- I confessed.

32:52.935 --> 32:56.055
- She knows I'm here.
- You did the right thing.

32:56.563 --> 33:00.063
I had to.
What about if she gets off on bail?

33:00.235 --> 33:03.354
She's angry with me,
the next thing you know--

33:07.659 --> 33:09.486
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah.

33:11.663 --> 33:15.198
- M. E. 's office says Devlin's on his way.
- Toxicology?

33:15.376 --> 33:17.701
- He didn't say.

33:17.878 --> 33:20.547
Have a seat, Mr. Fuentes.

33:21.506 --> 33:25.042
That witness, Fuentes,
in the Garcia homicide?

33:25.219 --> 33:28.802
He says him and Mrs. Garcia
were having an affair.

33:28.973 --> 33:31.891
- That's why she did the murder.
- I missed that?

33:32.101 --> 33:34.675
MEDAVOY: You didn't.
After your interview...

33:34.854 --> 33:40.394
...the woman calls from prison, says she
did her part, now he's got to do his.

33:40.568 --> 33:42.941
- That takes it to murder.
- Yeah.

33:43.113 --> 33:46.447
- Give it to the DA?
- Martinez is making a call.

33:46.617 --> 33:48.692
- Way to go.
- Yeah, thanks.

33:48.869 --> 33:51.906

the Garcia case.

33:52.081 --> 33:54.750
KELLY: Laurie was right, Andy.
- Uh- huh.

33:55.501 --> 33:59.084

DONNA:
Here you go, detective.

34:03.385 --> 34:08.045
The vet said to limit her exercise
and give her this medication.

34:08.389 --> 34:11.556
SlPOWlCZ: Thanks for picking her up.
- It was expensive.

34:11.726 --> 34:14.181
- Yeah.
- What's she got, anyway?

34:14.355 --> 34:19.313
She's afflicted with a complaint,
you know, a female- dog type of thing.

34:19.485 --> 34:24.563
What's the full- court press on Santini
about? They got mail service now.

34:24.949 --> 34:28.947
- What did you get off toxicology?
- This girl was a suicide.

34:29.120 --> 34:34.161
Trace amounts of narcotics in her
system, not enough to stupefy anyone...

34:34.333 --> 34:35.829
...let alone a junkie.

34:36.168 --> 34:38.458
She pulled the bag over her head.

34:38.630 --> 34:42.462
Otherwise, we'd have found
signs of struggle, resistance.

34:42.634 --> 34:44.922

- Yeah.

34:45.179 --> 34:50.304
- She's as much of a mess as that girl.
- Hey, you ain't exactly Clark Gable.

34:50.476 --> 34:56.350
- John, what did the M. E. say?
- Suicide, Mike.

34:57.650 --> 35:00.687

- Yeah, you did.

35:00.988 --> 35:03.609
That's right, I did.

- Yeah.

This won't take long, Roberts.

36:14.774 --> 36:18.606
M. E. 's finding was suicide, right?
He didn't have doubts?

36:18.778 --> 36:23.773
I read the report on the Santini case.
I talked with Sipowicz and Kelly.

36:23.951 --> 36:26.406
I also read her diary.

36:26.578 --> 36:28.488
That's pretty sad reading.

36:28.664 --> 36:31.665
I never actually gave her any drugs,
right?

36:32.043 --> 36:35.376
What I read in that diary
made me sick.

36:35.797 --> 36:39.960
Lieutenant,
let's remember she was a junkie, huh?

36:40.135 --> 36:45.426
- It's not like you can take their word.
- You took control of a weak...

36:45.598 --> 36:49.383
...suffering, dependent person.
You beat her.

36:49.811 --> 36:55.352
- You made sexual use of her--
- But I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.

36:55.525 --> 36:59.855
Which is what I understood
this inquiry to be all about, right?

37:00.030 --> 37:04.989
I mean, you don't see anything
criminal coming out of this, do you?

37:05.452 --> 37:09.700
- You put in for retirement.
- I need three years for full vesting.

37:09.874 --> 37:14.336
Today! I don't care what you lose
in vesting or in benefits.

Told me he'd smear me if I fought him.

on the banned- substances list.
