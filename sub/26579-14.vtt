WEBVTT

00:02.580 --> 00:04.038
Detectives Wolfe and Vestri,

00:04.040 --> 00:06.360
this has the potential of being
a very dangerous operation.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.419
Multiple gunmen, officers down.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.290
Vestri?

00:12.620 --> 00:13.829
You got the Tap.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.499
You're gonna be
one kick-ass detective.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.670
I'm not ready
to give up patrol yet.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.999
He swooped in like a bat out of
hell and crashed into my car.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.999
You hit me. Whoa, whoa.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.380
Let's just start at the
beginning, starting with you.

00:27.210 --> 00:28.829
I had engine trouble.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.959
And if I wasn't such a good
pilot, I would've crashed

00:30.960 --> 00:33.169
instead of making a controlled
emergency landing,

00:33.170 --> 00:35.669
so I deserve a little more
gratitude than attitude.

00:35.670 --> 00:38.829
Sir, can you step over here,
please?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.789
Those look like bullet holes.
What?

00:40.790 --> 00:42.959
No, those are, -
those are bird strikes.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.829
Let me guess... the elusive
brass-jacketed hollow point?

00:45.830 --> 00:47.829
Is that why you
had engine trouble, sir?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.959
Because someone
was shooting at you?

00:49.960 --> 00:51.330
Why would anyone do that?

00:58.420 --> 01:01.499
Control, 7-Adam-15,

01:01.500 --> 01:03.459
check in with OCPD

01:03.460 --> 01:06.249
and see if they have a 211 at
Orange County Savings and Loan.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.499
7-Adam-15, be advised

01:08.500 --> 01:09.999
the bank was robbed an hour ago.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.330
Suspect escaped in
a blue helicopter.

01:14.670 --> 01:16.120
Yep. Hands behind your head.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.999
100 shifts. Listen, not a lot of
rookies make it to this point

01:27.000 --> 01:29.669
in their probationary year.
It's a reason to celebrate.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.669
But not too much. For your first
100 shifts, your training officers

01:32.670 --> 01:33.999
have been there
to guide the way.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.499
Not today.

01:35.500 --> 01:36.829
Plain Clothes Day.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.499
That's right, Officer West.
Very good.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.829
I'm sorry,
what is Plain Clothes Day?

01:40.830 --> 01:42.829
Your T.O.s will be
out of uniform,

01:42.830 --> 01:45.959
riding with you in a strictly
observational capacity.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.169
They will not advise,

01:47.170 --> 01:49.379
assist, or help you in any way.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.749
Every decision
will be yours to make.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.419
Does this mean I finally get to
choose where we eat for lunch?

01:54.420 --> 01:55.919
Yes, Officer Nolan.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.749
For all intents and purposes,
today... you are alone.

01:59.750 --> 02:02.289
And that should scare the hell
out of you.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.879
This will be a true measure

02:03.880 --> 02:05.789
of where you are
in the learning process.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.119
And your performance today
could have a profound impact

02:08.120 --> 02:10.329
on your career path
in this department.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.119
So, any questions?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.499
Yes, sir.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.209
What happens if we
get into real trouble?

02:17.210 --> 02:19.119
Deal with it.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.209
And if you can't,
your T.O. will step in.

02:21.210 --> 02:22.879
But make no mistake...

02:22.880 --> 02:25.170
If that happens,
you will be judged.

02:26.290 --> 02:27.539
That's it.

02:27.540 --> 02:28.919
Good luck out there.

02:28.920 --> 02:30.959
Are you guys as excited
about this as I am?

02:30.960 --> 02:32.499
We finally get
to call the shots.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.749
I know, right. Whoa, slow down.

02:34.750 --> 02:37.209
You two realize that 20%
of probationary officers

02:37.210 --> 02:40.209
that wash out of the program do
it during Plain Clothes Day.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.709
Don't tell us that!

02:41.710 --> 02:43.579
Why would you tell us that?
Motivation.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.169
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

02:45.170 --> 02:47.419
Please, they're just as green
as they were yesterday.

02:47.420 --> 02:50.079
What are you looking at, Boot?
I'm not even here.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.079
Let's go get our gear.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.289
My wash out number's three.
What about you?

02:54.290 --> 02:56.749
Same. I bet Tim's is up
in double digits by now.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.379
Damn straight.
I've had 11 rookies

02:58.380 --> 03:00.499
bounced from the program
during Plain Clothes Day.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.329
Looking to make it
an even dozen today.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.669
Do not listen.

03:03.670 --> 03:05.119
They're just trying
to psych us out.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.499
Already making a mistake.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.079
If we're not here,
why get two kit bags?

03:09.080 --> 03:10.669
We're supposed to have two bags,

03:10.670 --> 03:12.829
just in case they have
to take action.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.619
First mistake avoided.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.380
So many left to make.

03:19.880 --> 03:22.750
This is going to be
a very long day.

03:23.830 --> 03:25.329
Hey.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.829
I didn't know you were back.

03:26.830 --> 03:27.830
Restricted duty.

03:27.831 --> 03:29.209
I'm on my house mouse,

03:29.210 --> 03:31.379
pushing papers,
catching calls, you know.

03:31.380 --> 03:32.380
It's good to see you.

03:32.381 --> 03:34.209
It's good to be seen.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.669
What are you doing
wearing civvies?

03:35.670 --> 03:37.879
Plain Clothes Day.

03:37.880 --> 03:39.789
Right.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.499
I remember mine.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.379
I got in a fist fight
with a 300-pound woman.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.329
Who won?

03:46.330 --> 03:48.459
The orthopedic surgeon
who had to fix my shoulder,

03:48.460 --> 03:49.749
that's who won.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.459
I heard you put a pin in

03:51.460 --> 03:52.999
that detective's exam.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.669
What happened?

03:54.670 --> 03:58.329
Realized I still had few things
to accomplish as a P3...

03:58.330 --> 04:02.250
Especially after what happened
to you... and Vestri.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.119
It was a nice funeral.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.419
Yeah...

04:11.420 --> 04:14.709
So, how long before you're
cleared for regular duty?

04:14.710 --> 04:16.379
I'm not rushing it.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.249
No shame in taking a beat when
something like that happens.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.790
None at all.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.500
Bishop.

04:28.460 --> 04:29.620
Thank you.

04:31.580 --> 04:34.419
I wouldn't be here without you.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.250
Any time.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.379
What are you doing?

04:44.380 --> 04:45.999
Filled out your evaluation.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.749
But we haven't even left yet.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.249
Yeah.

04:49.250 --> 04:50.879
I already know how
today's gonna go.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.379
No, you don't.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.999
You're just trying
to get in my head.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.580
But it won't work.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.120
Right...

05:08.330 --> 05:10.080
Thank you.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.000 --> 05:26.210
Don't open it
until end of shift.

05:29.170 --> 05:32.960
Whatever you wrote in here,
I'm gonna prove you wrong.

05:34.170 --> 05:37.380
I knew you'd say that.
It's in there.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.749
Is it true Plain Clothes Day
determines

05:42.750 --> 05:44.120
the track of our career?

05:46.000 --> 05:48.829
That's right. I get it. Sorry.

05:48.830 --> 05:50.789
You're not here.

05:50.790 --> 05:52.579
It's not that I'm worried
or anything.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.709
Just... I don't want to be stuck
with some lame assignment

05:54.710 --> 05:56.539
like front desk.

05:56.540 --> 05:57.999
You think front desk would be

05:58.000 --> 05:59.499
a perfect fit for me, don't you?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.039
Lots of people to talk to
about their problems.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.499
No, thank you.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.169
I did not join the force
to be a receptionist.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.749
Matter of fact, I've spent
the last few months

06:06.750 --> 06:10.669
figuring out exactly where
I want to be assigned...

06:10.670 --> 06:12.749
Robbery-homicide.

06:12.750 --> 06:15.669
Ambitious, I know.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.039
Making detective
in five years...

06:17.040 --> 06:18.669
That's unheard of...
And I'd be 50,

06:18.670 --> 06:20.880
so that just means I'm gonna
have to buck the odds.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.999
Pedal to the metal.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.960
And when I do it...
you're gonna eat your words.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.669
Come on...

06:34.670 --> 06:36.709
We're the last ones out.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.039
I needed reading materials.
Okay. You should know,

06:39.040 --> 06:41.039
I've been waiting for this day
my entire life.

06:41.040 --> 06:44.249
Wow, that's sad. Did you know that my
dad had an epic Plain Clothes Day?

06:44.250 --> 06:46.829
I don't care.
Made four felony arrests,

06:46.830 --> 06:49.669
wrote seven traffic violations,
and talked a woman off a ledge.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.209
So you see, I can't just... You're
gonna break your father's records

06:52.210 --> 06:53.709
like you broke
his Academy records

06:53.710 --> 06:55.209
because you have daddy issues,

06:55.210 --> 06:57.050
and the cat's in the cradle,
and all that crap.

06:58.170 --> 07:00.540
I don't have daddy issues.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.880
No.

07:11.290 --> 07:14.380
This can't be happening.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.210
Come on, come on.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.039
First time you've let me drive.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.499
I'm not here, Boot. Right.

07:22.500 --> 07:24.500
Of course. Sorry.

07:28.330 --> 07:32.080
Why would a guy from the power
company need a video camera?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.039
That sick bastard.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.620
He's filming her.

08:01.170 --> 08:02.750
LAPD, stop!

08:10.620 --> 08:12.329
Hands behind your back.

08:12.330 --> 08:13.829
Easy.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.459
I didn't do anything!

08:15.460 --> 08:17.879
Yeah, well, your camera
says otherwise.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.619
Do you even work
at the power company?

08:19.620 --> 08:22.379
Lawyer. Yeah, you're
gonna need one.

08:22.380 --> 08:25.289
7-Adam-19, show us one in
custody, 3rd and Arden.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.669
Did you include this arrest

08:26.670 --> 08:30.329
in your evaluation,
Officer Bradford?

08:30.330 --> 08:31.619
Watch your head.

08:31.620 --> 08:32.750
Get in.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.669
7-Adam-15, RP heard sounds

08:36.669 --> 08:39.250
of an assault
at 7944 Serrano Avenue.

08:42.330 --> 08:43.750
Control, show me Code 6.

08:47.170 --> 08:48.829
Stop, please.

08:48.830 --> 08:51.500
Start me up another unit...
944 Serrano.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.789
I'll pay you back!

08:56.790 --> 08:58.209
Think you're gonna
rip off my stash,

08:58.210 --> 08:59.830
and I'm just gonna take an IOU?!

09:05.170 --> 09:06.960
Hey! Police! Let him go!

09:22.460 --> 09:24.170
Aah! Aah!

09:30.330 --> 09:35.580
All right, watch him.

10:03.710 --> 10:05.540
Facedown! Drop the pipe!

10:06.790 --> 10:09.879
Hands behind your back.

10:09.880 --> 10:14.040
Control, show me
with two in custody.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.079
Where did he go?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.459
Who? My second suspect.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.499
Him? Well, he ran off.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.209
Well, hobbled, really.

10:23.210 --> 10:24.499
I told you to watch him.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.329
I'm not here to watch suspects,
Officer Nolan... just you.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.419
So you let him get away?
Of course not.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.169
I would never leave
a suspect unattended,

10:31.170 --> 10:33.379
allowing ample time
for his escape.

10:33.380 --> 10:35.040
But you did.

10:40.620 --> 10:43.499
I can't believe you did this
just to have a teachable moment.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.669
That's right, Officer Nolan.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.119
Keep blaming me for your lack
of situational awareness.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.619
I had to go after him.
Yes, but not before

10:48.620 --> 10:51.379
you secured your first suspect
to something immobile.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.289
Instead of dreaming about
becoming detective,

10:53.290 --> 10:55.499
how about you try and just
get through today?

10:55.500 --> 10:57.879
Yes, ma'am.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.499
Damn it, this guy could be anywhere.
Relax.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.379
From the crunch your suspect's
knee made when you whacked him,

11:03.380 --> 11:05.500
I doubt he got very f...

11:12.460 --> 11:14.420
Looks like you cracked
the case, Detective.

11:19.710 --> 11:22.329
Just got off the phone
with dispatch.

11:22.330 --> 11:25.999
My suspect, Todd Collins,
is on parole for a 261.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.119
He's a tier 3 sex offender
and a 290... violent-habitual.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.880
That's a pretty good arrest,

11:34.880 --> 11:36.499
Okay.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.249
Let's see, I've got
my victim's statement,

11:40.250 --> 11:43.789
seized my suspect's phone,
canvassed for witnesses...

11:43.790 --> 11:45.579
Ch-ch ch-ch ch-ch ch-ch.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.999
Yep, we're good to go.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.669
What?

11:49.670 --> 11:52.499
Didn't say anything. But
you're giving me the look.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.749
What look? That look.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.249
Am I missing something?
Wait, don't answer that.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.999
Wasn't going to. Good.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.329
Because...

11:59.330 --> 12:00.710
I made a solid pinch here.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.790
All right. Let's go.

12:12.790 --> 12:14.209
This is ridiculous.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.209
Two hours to change
a dead battery.

12:16.210 --> 12:18.079
I could've been on
my second arrest by now.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.919
Look on the bright side...
I bet your dad doesn't hold

12:19.920 --> 12:23.039
the record for longest
automotive delay.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.079
Okay, West, good to go. Finally.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.379
Back in business. Lopez, I need
your Boot for a work detail.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.249
Sure thing. What? No.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.579
Sir, it's...
It's my Plain Clothes Day.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.749
I didn't know.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.499
In that case, I need you
for a work detail.

12:38.500 --> 12:42.039
Evidence from a homicide.
Catalog every single piece.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.750
Got it? Yes, sir.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.999
You got to get me
out of this, please.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.209
No, I don't. The job's the job.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.879
Nothing in the rules says
you have to spend.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.879
Plain Clothes Day out on patrol.

12:53.880 --> 12:54.960
Hey.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.040
You think I'd look cute in this?

13:03.330 --> 13:05.539
I bet you're wondering
what I am doing.

13:05.540 --> 13:07.119
You're running
all the plates in the lot,

13:07.120 --> 13:09.709
hoping to find one registered
to a felon with a warrant.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.209
Am I detecting a tone?

13:11.210 --> 13:12.619
No tone.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.419
What's wrong with running plates?
Nothing.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.169
It's one way to do the job...

13:16.170 --> 13:18.499
Make it all about you,
beef up your felony arrests.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.419
Okay, definitely
detecting a tone.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.499
No, not at all.
I'm not even here.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.289
If there's a call from dispatch,
I'll take it.

13:24.290 --> 13:26.379
But all's quiet on the western
front, so why not see

13:26.380 --> 13:28.169
if there's a felon
I can get off the streets.

13:28.170 --> 13:31.119
That's self-initiated policing.
And it's pretty effective.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.379
Or you could patrol your beat,
engage the community,

13:33.380 --> 13:35.249
which deters crime from
happening in the first place.

13:35.250 --> 13:37.169
That's proactive policing.

13:37.170 --> 13:38.919
Less felony arrests
on your score card

13:38.920 --> 13:40.709
but far more effective.
Well, it's a good thing

13:40.710 --> 13:42.289
I'm making the decisions today.

13:42.290 --> 13:44.289
I just got a hit on
that red Expedition.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.459
Control, 7-Adam-15, send backup

13:46.460 --> 13:48.879
for an ATL on
a Marcus Quincannon,

13:48.880 --> 13:51.329
felony arrest for arms
trafficking.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.120
Copy that.

13:54.540 --> 13:56.420
Inside. Yeah.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.879
I know everything
you're gonna do, Boot.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.289
Just like I knew
you wouldn't process

14:13.290 --> 14:14.829
all your suspect's property.

14:14.830 --> 14:16.499
What are you talking about?

14:16.500 --> 14:18.709
I took everything
Todd Collins had...

14:18.710 --> 14:23.499
Wallet, camera, phone, keys.-

14:23.500 --> 14:27.169
So tell me, how did Peeping Todd
get to where you arrested him?

14:27.170 --> 14:28.499
He drove.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.829
Like I said,
I have his car keys.

14:29.830 --> 14:31.619
But not his car.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.539
Most child sex offenders have
a network with other offenders.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.829
They share videos
of their sick desires,

14:36.830 --> 14:38.959
which leads to other victims.
Other suspects.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.329
Where do you think they keep
this cornucopia of evidence?

14:41.330 --> 14:43.119
- In their cars...
- That's right.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.999
In case parole officers
search their houses.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.499
His car is a treasure trove
of evidence.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.379
Other crimes,
more victims, DNA...

14:50.380 --> 14:52.169
Evidence we may never have
obtained otherwise.

14:52.170 --> 14:53.579
And you just left it
in the street.

14:53.580 --> 14:54.580
W... Um...

14:56.170 --> 14:59.880
He was fiddling with his phone
the entire time he was running.

15:07.290 --> 15:09.419
"Cops got me. Get my van."

15:09.420 --> 15:10.960
You recall seeing a van, Boot?

15:11.960 --> 15:14.329
There was that blue van.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.710
That work van.
It was right there!

15:32.920 --> 15:36.119
Control, we need a reverse
directory on a vehicle

15:36.120 --> 15:38.039
registered to Todd Collins.

15:38.040 --> 15:40.999
7-Adam-19, subject
owns a blue '98 Econoline.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.249
E-350 van
with California plates,

15:43.250 --> 15:46.459
Six-Paul-Charlie-Ida-
zero-niner-three.

15:46.460 --> 15:47.829
It shows the vehicle
was impounded

15:47.830 --> 15:49.999
from your location an hour ago.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.830
What?

15:54.210 --> 15:56.669
You had the van impounded?

15:56.670 --> 15:58.579
Once it was clear
you overlooked that detail.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.669
But then why did we
race over here?

16:00.670 --> 16:01.999
So you could discover
your own mistake.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.499
That's what today's
all about, Boot.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.709
W... A-And it's just a bonus
that you get to humiliate me?

16:05.710 --> 16:07.499
Don't blame me for the fact
that you let yourself

16:07.500 --> 16:09.619
get rattled by one dubious look.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.829
You make it out here and find
yourself riding solo,

16:11.830 --> 16:14.619
these streets will test you in
ways you didn't think possible.

16:14.620 --> 16:15.959
The only way to survive

16:15.960 --> 16:18.830
is to control your environment
at all times.

16:22.210 --> 16:25.210
You're pretty talkative
for a silent observer.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.459
All right, boys, listen up.

16:28.460 --> 16:31.499
The felon we are after
is one Marcus Quincannon.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.499
Intel has led me to believe
he's currently in room 104.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.079
Here, I've drawn a detailed
layout of the motel room.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.169
As you can see, there are...

16:39.170 --> 16:40.749
Four walls and a toilet.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.959
Like every other motel room
in the world.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.829
We really gotta take orders
from your Boot?

16:44.830 --> 16:46.329
He's in charge today, Smitty.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.999
Trust me.
I've got this all worked out.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.539
I'm going in first.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.539
Janssen, you're gonna be
covering C-side containment.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.499
Smitty, you'll be breaching.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.039
I'll come in straight.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.669
I want you to come swing around
the open side.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.379
If I call "Trailer, trailer",
you come from C-side

16:58.380 --> 17:00.209
to A-side and trail in
behind us.

17:00.210 --> 17:02.039
Textbook dynamic entry.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.669
Okay, let's do it. All right.
I'm green, and go. Smitty?

17:04.670 --> 17:06.329
Yeah. Green and go.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.829
Breach, breach.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.670
Show me your hands! My God!
What are you doing?!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.709
Bathroom clear. Room clear.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.579
Where's Marcus Quincannon?

17:28.580 --> 17:30.249
Who?

17:30.250 --> 17:32.539
The owner of the red Expedition
outside.

17:32.540 --> 17:33.919
The motel manager said
it belonged

17:33.920 --> 17:35.169
to the person in this room.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.999
Yeah. Me.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.169
I bought it from some guy on
Craigslist like three days ago.

17:40.170 --> 17:43.079
I was just filling out
the DMV change of title.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.289
She's telling the truth,
Officer Nolan.

17:45.290 --> 17:47.250
Your gun-runner
was never even here.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.039
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.620
Obviously,
there's been a mistake.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.710
Do you know how long it
took me to get Liza down?

18:01.670 --> 18:03.579
You woke her up.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.330
You can put her back to bed.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.829
Hello?

18:15.830 --> 18:17.710
LAPD. Anyone home?

18:20.500 --> 18:23.669
Hey, girl. It's okay.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.209
Not exactly what I meant by
control your environment.

18:26.210 --> 18:28.999
That dog barks all the time.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.879
Ma'am, do you know if
the dog's owner is home?

18:30.880 --> 18:33.379
Shut up!

18:33.380 --> 18:35.170
Shut up, Missy!

18:37.330 --> 18:39.829
Hey, whoa.
There's no need for that.

18:39.830 --> 18:42.329
Honey, she's my dog.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.119
I can treat her however
the hell I want.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.959
Sir, we've received a complaint
about your dog.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.119
And I wonder who made it!

18:50.120 --> 18:52.249
Emma, you called the damn cops?!

18:52.250 --> 18:53.749
Your dog's a menace.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.999
It's just bark, bark, bark...
All day long.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.919
It's a dog.
It's kind of their thing.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.880
Ma'am, just step aside.
I'll handle this.

19:02.330 --> 19:05.209
Sir, you need to try to keep
your dog from barking.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.289
No problem.

19:07.290 --> 19:09.420
I'm good at making bitches
shut their mouths.

19:13.210 --> 19:14.919
Have a nice day, sir.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.379
Shut the hell up.

19:18.380 --> 19:21.169
Hey, stop kicking dirt
at the dog, or else.

19:21.170 --> 19:25.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
or else what?

19:26.330 --> 19:28.499
If I have to come back here,

19:28.500 --> 19:32.499
or even get a whiff that
you're abusing this animal,

19:32.500 --> 19:35.539
I will make you
my personal project.

19:35.540 --> 19:37.210
Do you understand?

19:43.330 --> 19:45.420
I'd say I controlled
that environment.

19:48.210 --> 19:51.379
This is a complete waste of time.
It's part of the job, Boot.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.879
I did not become a police
officer to do clerical work.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.709
Yeah, well, if you don't
then whoever murdered...

19:56.710 --> 19:59.669
Richard Ochoa might get off
on a technicality at trial.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.579
Yeah, I get all of that, but
I should be out on the street.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.709
We only have one
Plain Clothes Day.

20:04.710 --> 20:06.209
The only thing certain
about this job

20:06.210 --> 20:08.169
is that it's unpredictable.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.830
You're not helping.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.999
Hi, Officer? Hi.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.209
Do you have a moment?

20:23.210 --> 20:24.749
A quick one, yes. What is it?

20:24.750 --> 20:27.039
So, this might be
a silly question,

20:27.040 --> 20:29.919
but I was wondering...
How hard is it for, um,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.209
someone to track
your credit card purchases?

20:32.210 --> 20:33.749
You mean like identity theft?

20:33.750 --> 20:36.579
No, not... not like that.
Like a-a regular person...

20:36.580 --> 20:38.709
But for a card
that's in another name.

20:38.710 --> 20:41.329
Like d-do the charges post
immediately or...

20:41.330 --> 20:42.829
Tell you what,
on the bottom of that card

20:42.830 --> 20:44.579
is the non-emergency number

20:44.580 --> 20:46.499
for the Mid-Wilshire Police
Station. You give them a call.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.079
They'll have time to answer
all your questions.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.209
Who should I ask for?...front desk,

20:50.210 --> 20:52.039
which is where I'm gonna
wind up if I don't get moving.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.169
You have a nice day.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.379
So, good news,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.169
I taught the mother
a swaddling method.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.459
Baby Liza is sleeping soundly.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.749
I'm glad something positive
came out of your time here.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.209
Well, hang on. I wouldn't call

21:04.210 --> 21:05.749
what happened here today
a total failure.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.289
You told us we can't
predict outcome,

21:07.290 --> 21:09.119
only do our best to control it.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.619
I developed a strong,
credible lead,

21:11.620 --> 21:14.419
and I commanded a flawless
dynamic entry.

21:14.420 --> 21:17.039
Where you terrorized a mother
and a newborn child.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.039
Now, if she was terrorized,

21:19.040 --> 21:20.829
would she have given me
the address in Simi Valley

21:20.830 --> 21:22.539
where she purchased the car?

21:22.540 --> 21:25.419
Simi Valley PD is sending a unit
to arrest our gun-runner.

21:25.420 --> 21:27.999
They told me they'd give me a
call as soon as he's in custody.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.079
Lunch?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.619
Sir. Dispatch says you
wanted to see us.

21:33.620 --> 21:34.620
Yeah, shut the door.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.579
You know, I remember
my Plain Clothes Day.

21:39.580 --> 21:42.749
It was a long time ago,
but I remember it.

21:42.750 --> 21:44.669
Desperate to make an impression.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.289
My T.O. watching me like a hawk.

21:47.290 --> 21:50.169
But the pressure got to me,

21:50.170 --> 21:52.119
and I made all kinds
of mistakes...

21:52.120 --> 21:53.959
Stupid ones, too.

21:53.960 --> 21:56.039
And completely out of character.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.119
Which is why, Officer Chen,

21:58.120 --> 22:01.209
I sympathize
with your situation.

22:01.210 --> 22:04.539
Sir? We got a rude
conduct complaint

22:04.540 --> 22:08.169
against you from, um...

22:08.170 --> 22:10.330
a Rodney Acker.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.459
He said you verbally
threatened him

22:13.460 --> 22:15.959
to get his dog in line, or else.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.669
Any way to cool this guy off,
sir?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.789
I tried, but he's pretty dug in.

22:19.790 --> 22:21.669
He wants to make it formal,

22:21.670 --> 22:24.499
so Internal Affairs
has been notified.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.959
Captain Anderson
is in meetings all day,

22:26.960 --> 22:28.829
but she wants to talk to you
at the end of shift.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.999
Sir, what kind of
disciplinary action

22:32.000 --> 22:34.119
am I looking at? Don't
get ahead of yourself.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.919
She should know.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.419
Threatening a civilian is a
serious offense for any officer,

22:39.420 --> 22:42.039
but to do it
as a probationary employee?

22:42.040 --> 22:45.539
Even a minor infraction
can have a serious impact.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.789
How serious?
Worst case scenario,

22:47.790 --> 22:50.670
you'll be my 12th rookie to
wash out on Plain Clothes Day.

22:58.380 --> 23:00.579
Lucy, they are not
gonna kick you out

23:00.580 --> 23:01.829
of the program over this.
I don't know.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.749
I mean, you should have seen
Sergeant Grey's face.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.999
It was utter disappointment.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.420
He gives me that look every day,
and I'm still here.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.499
If Chen threatened the guy,

23:10.500 --> 23:12.459
why didn't you step in
and sort it out?

23:12.460 --> 23:13.999
It's Plain Clothes Day.
That'd be cheating.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.419
You know I'm a man
of principles.

23:15.420 --> 23:16.999
Yeah, but they could
terminate her.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.539
Come on, I'm not gonna
let that happen.

23:18.540 --> 23:19.879
Thought you were a man
of principles?

23:19.880 --> 23:21.250
And contradictions.

23:23.170 --> 23:24.879
You think he's back too soon?

23:24.880 --> 23:27.379
No such thing as too soon.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.079
Tim, drop the macho act.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.249
The guy lost his partner
in the line.

23:31.250 --> 23:33.250
Some cops never recover
from that.

23:34.420 --> 23:35.880
I'll be back.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.079
Is this seat taken? Hey. No.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.789
Sit down.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.539
How's Plain Clothes Day going?

23:46.540 --> 23:47.879
So far so good.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.120
How are you doing?
So far so good.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.120
- You're not buying that.
- Nope.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.419
We're trained to be vigilant,
you know?

23:59.420 --> 24:01.999
Cop eyes...
Always scanning for trouble.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.829
But we never saw it coming.

24:03.830 --> 24:05.619
One second we're riding
the elevator,

24:05.620 --> 24:08.379
the next we're shot to hell.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.710
There's nothing you could've
done differently.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.500
We should grab a drink sometime.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.499
Are you asking me out on a date?

24:19.500 --> 24:22.249
No. No. No!

24:22.250 --> 24:24.579
That's not what I meant.

24:24.580 --> 24:26.249
I would never date you.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.749
I mean, I would... date you...

24:28.750 --> 24:30.919
but... you know what I mean.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.459
Right.

24:32.460 --> 24:34.669
So I'm gonna get back to work.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.920
Sure. Thanks for checking on me.

24:38.750 --> 24:42.119
All right,
enough of this pity party.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.959
This morning was a disaster,
which means

24:43.960 --> 24:46.039
the rest of this day
can only get better.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.169
Did I just jinx us?
Little bit, yes.

24:48.170 --> 24:50.379
Listen, Lucy,
a cop as good as you,

24:50.380 --> 24:52.039
they're not gonna let you
go down over this.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.329
You know what really
pisses me off?

24:54.330 --> 24:56.329
It's not that
I might lose my job.

24:56.330 --> 24:57.829
It's that dog.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.039
She's just stuck
with that monster.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.169
I know.

25:03.170 --> 25:05.420
Anyway... see you.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.749
Detective Wolfe.

25:08.750 --> 25:10.209
Nice to see you back.

25:10.210 --> 25:11.919
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.419
You're Talia's Boot, right?

25:13.420 --> 25:14.919
Yeah.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.539
How's your Plain Clothes Day
going?

25:16.540 --> 25:19.379
I won one, and I lost one.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.420
How'd you like to win
another one?

25:23.080 --> 25:25.039
You know what,
losing half the day

25:25.040 --> 25:26.539
presents an interesting
challenge.

25:26.540 --> 25:29.079
I'm not following.
What if I can match

25:29.080 --> 25:32.209
my father's record
in half the time?

25:32.210 --> 25:34.709
Come on, Lopez, let's roll.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.709
You did not just say that.

25:36.710 --> 25:38.329
You two on
the Richard Ochoa murder?

25:38.330 --> 25:39.999
No, he just cataloged
some evidence.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.669
Well, the widow of the victim
is at the front desk,

25:41.670 --> 25:42.999
and she wants to talk
to someone.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.879
Ask Wolfe. I can't find him.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.290
But I found you.
So take care of it, all right?

25:49.080 --> 25:50.459
My gosh.

25:50.460 --> 25:53.379
You're moving with purpose.
I got a hot lead.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.249
Let me guess, a methadone clinic
to look for drug addicts.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.999
A little hotter than that.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.249
This is a warrant
for a 211 suspect.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.499
How'd you get this? Detective
Wolfe gave it to me.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.459
Detectives hip pocket
these type of warrants.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.789
They don't give them away.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.419
He said he had to make amends.

26:08.420 --> 26:10.749
What did he do?

26:10.750 --> 26:13.169
7-Adam-15,
suspicious circumstance

26:13.170 --> 26:15.079
at Pico Arms Motel.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.209
Pico Arms.
That's your favorite motel.

26:17.210 --> 26:19.209
Control, is there
a room number on that?

26:19.210 --> 26:21.249
103.

26:21.250 --> 26:23.169
The mother and baby were in 104.

26:23.170 --> 26:26.750
7-Adam-15, are you
accepting the call?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.669
We've got a felony warrant
to serve.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.709
We take that over this, right?

26:31.710 --> 26:33.500
Your call. I'm not here.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.789
Control, show me attached
to the Pico Arms Motel.

26:40.790 --> 26:42.330
Copy that.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.039
Mrs. Ochoa?

26:50.040 --> 26:51.669
I'm sorry, but the detective

26:51.670 --> 26:53.789
covering your husband's case
isn't available.

26:53.790 --> 26:55.459
I can have him call you.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.879
Can't you help me?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.499
With what, ma'am?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.379
I'm forgetting him.

27:01.380 --> 27:05.119
Ma'am? My husband, Richard,

27:05.120 --> 27:07.879
he was murdered in our bedroom
by home invaders.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.999
I was... out of town.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.669
The detectives came
and took everything...

27:14.670 --> 27:16.879
His bible, jewelry, clothes.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.459
They left me nothing.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.539
That's procedure, ma'am.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.709
Everything inside of the room
is evidence.

27:22.710 --> 27:24.959
It's not just evidence.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.789
They're memories.

27:26.790 --> 27:29.749
And that's all I have left
of him now.

27:29.750 --> 27:31.539
I beg of you.

27:31.540 --> 27:33.380
Give them back to me.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.959
I'm... I'm sorry, Mrs. Ochoa.

27:42.960 --> 27:45.879
Your husband's property must be
held until after the trial.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.380
There's nothing I can do.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.669
That was awful. Yeah.

28:01.670 --> 28:03.670
Making a few arrests ought
to cheer you up, right?

28:05.830 --> 28:07.209
Let's go.

28:07.210 --> 28:08.710
Is there a problem, Boot?

28:10.080 --> 28:13.379
I'm making the decisions today.

28:13.380 --> 28:14.789
Okay.

28:14.790 --> 28:16.540
So what do you have in mind?

28:20.710 --> 28:22.879
When housekeeping
came to service the room,

28:22.880 --> 28:24.580
they found this.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.539
Control, notify the sergeant

28:38.540 --> 28:40.619
and Missing Persons
on a possible 207.

28:40.620 --> 28:44.459
Copy that. Why are you
calling in Sergeant Grey?

28:44.460 --> 28:47.079
I met that woman.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.040
She's the one who
asked me for help.

28:55.210 --> 28:57.999
She was asking about tracking
credit cards or something.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.879
I'm not sure. It was a very
quick conversation.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.879
The victim's name
is Lynn McDaniels.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.959
She lives in Van Nuys
with her husband, Chris...

29:03.960 --> 29:06.499
A trucker with a serious history
of domestic violence.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.169
There's a BOLO out for him now.

29:08.170 --> 29:09.999
Detectives are reaching out
to friends and family.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.579
You should probably
get back on the street.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.119
Sergeant, if it's all the same,

29:13.120 --> 29:14.669
I'd like to stay attached to this.
I know.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.919
But standing here, crossing
fingers, helps no one.

29:17.920 --> 29:20.290
When I hear something,
you'll hear something.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.249
This man filed a complaint
against me.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.879
We shouldn't be back here.
You're right.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.959
You shouldn't be here. I'm fine.

29:35.960 --> 29:38.669
Aren't I supposed to be making
all the decisions today?

29:38.670 --> 29:40.209
You are. And right now,

29:40.210 --> 29:42.209
you decided to let me
save your job.

29:42.210 --> 29:44.709
Sir, it means a lot that you
care about my future

29:44.710 --> 29:46.959
as an officer, but this
is... Relax, Boot.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.499
I simply believe that if
you're gonna get fired,

29:48.500 --> 29:49.919
it'll be because of me,

29:49.920 --> 29:51.999
not some asshat's
rude conduct complaint.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.670
Stay here.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.710
LAPD.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.579
What do you want? Here's
the thing, Mr. Acker.

30:03.580 --> 30:06.169
Officer Chen got
a little overzealous.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.669
You call it overzealous,

30:07.670 --> 30:09.749
I call it a threat under
the color of authority.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.619
We'll see what a jury decides.

30:11.620 --> 30:14.079
Hey, look, you're upset.
That's understandable.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.539
So, perhaps we can work
this out.

30:16.540 --> 30:18.879
Go on, keep talking. Look, if
there's anything I can do for you,

30:18.880 --> 30:21.329
anything you might need a police
officer's assistance with,

30:21.330 --> 30:22.829
you just let me... Hello?

30:22.830 --> 30:25.039
Watch commander, please.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.539
Why are you calling my boss?

30:26.540 --> 30:28.119
Because I'm gonna make
a harassment complaint

30:28.120 --> 30:29.670
against you, too, pal.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.169
Have a good night, sir.

30:33.170 --> 30:34.829
I will.

30:34.830 --> 30:37.500
You, I'm not so sure!

30:43.080 --> 30:45.329
How'd it go? Drive.

30:45.330 --> 30:47.830
Hold on.

30:59.670 --> 31:01.620
Is that blood?

31:03.880 --> 31:05.879
Could be blood.
Could be something else.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.459
But it could be blood.
Which gives me PC.

31:08.460 --> 31:09.749
I can search that garage.

31:09.750 --> 31:10.999
Look, if you're wrong,

31:11.000 --> 31:12.669
he'll claim you're retaliating
against him.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.669
You'll definitely be fired,
and he'll just add another zero

31:14.670 --> 31:16.329
to his settlement check
with the city.

31:16.330 --> 31:17.880
Smart move here is to walk away.

31:19.500 --> 31:20.999
So what's it gonna be, Boot?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.670
It's your call.

31:43.380 --> 31:45.249
Missy, what's going on in there?

31:45.250 --> 31:46.960
No, don't open that!

31:51.250 --> 31:53.419
It was an accident.
She... She got in my face.

31:53.420 --> 31:54.999
She just wouldn't shut up!

31:55.000 --> 31:56.329
You're under arrest.

31:56.330 --> 31:57.709
Hey!

31:57.710 --> 31:58.879
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground!

31:58.880 --> 32:01.289
All right.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.920
Hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.379
Shut up, Missy!

32:09.380 --> 32:10.829
That's a good dog.

32:10.830 --> 32:12.829
7-Adam-15, possible GPS hit

32:12.830 --> 32:14.579
on motel suspect's cellphone.

32:14.580 --> 32:19.919
Alley, adjacent to
7419 Hayworth Avenue.

32:19.920 --> 32:23.250
Control, show me Code 6.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.710
Clear.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.790
Nolan.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.959
Okay, I know you're not here,

32:43.960 --> 32:45.169
and I'm supposed to wait
for backup.

32:45.170 --> 32:47.580
Screw that. Let's go.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.380
You like that?!

33:08.330 --> 33:09.880
Shut up!

33:12.040 --> 33:14.420
Chris... please, don't...

33:16.500 --> 33:17.830
Police! Drop it!

33:22.000 --> 33:23.330
You good?

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Please.

33:26.001 --> 33:27.959
Stay back!

33:27.960 --> 33:29.619
Don't do that again.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.289
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

33:31.290 --> 33:33.119
Requesting backup. Code 3.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.959
Lynn, you're gonna be okay.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.290
No, she's not.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.119
Just wait outside.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.379
Me and the missus
got some things to sort out.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.709
Then I'll turn myself in.

33:46.710 --> 33:48.709
We wait, he kills her.

33:48.710 --> 33:50.919
If we expose ourselves,
he'll shoot us.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.709
Can you drive a rig?

33:52.710 --> 33:54.669
That's a bad idea.

33:54.670 --> 33:57.040
Then I'm going now.
He shoots me, you shoot him.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.750
Channel nine.

34:03.170 --> 34:04.170
Please...

34:06.620 --> 34:08.208
Hey, Chris, how about we talk?

34:08.210 --> 34:10.708
You and me.
What's there to talk about?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.708
You letting your wife go.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.120
No.

34:15.670 --> 34:17.289
In position. Standing by.

34:17.290 --> 34:19.998
She promised forever, then left.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.168
Chris, I know how you feel, man.

34:23.170 --> 34:26.289
I was married, too... 20 years.

34:26.290 --> 34:28.748
One day I come home,
there's a note on the table,

34:28.750 --> 34:30.498
tells me it's over.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.119
It hurts.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.879
Don't patronize me.

34:33.880 --> 34:35.619
You don't know me.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.579
What she's done to me.

34:37.580 --> 34:40.418
You've never been in my shoes.
You're right.

34:40.420 --> 34:42.418
Start the countdown. Three...

34:42.420 --> 34:44.248
You're right, I haven't
been in your shoes, Chris.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.789
My marriage ended
because we drifted apart.

34:47.790 --> 34:49.958
Two... Your marriage
failed because

34:49.960 --> 34:51.918
you're a low-life domestic abuser.
One.

34:51.920 --> 34:53.250
Brace.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.960
Get off of me!

35:08.540 --> 35:10.329
God...

35:10.330 --> 35:11.829
I thought this was it.

35:11.830 --> 35:13.619
I thought he was finally
gonna kill me.

35:13.620 --> 35:15.829
It's okay. You're safe now.

35:15.830 --> 35:17.830
Come on. I got you.
I got you. Okay.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.709
Control, one in custody.

35:22.710 --> 35:24.119
Send an R/A unit.

35:24.120 --> 35:25.670
Show us Code 4.

35:26.830 --> 35:29.329
Thanks for coming back in.

35:29.330 --> 35:31.579
While cataloging
your husband's effects,

35:31.580 --> 35:35.669
I, discovered one item
not in the actual crime scene.

35:35.670 --> 35:37.959
It was in the hallway,
so you can have it back.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.499
What is it?

35:39.500 --> 35:42.500
Unfortunately,
it's just a broken watch.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.499
It's not broken.

35:46.500 --> 35:48.999
Just cheap.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.710
See?

35:52.000 --> 35:55.829
When we got married,
we were broke.

35:55.830 --> 35:57.829
I scraped together a few dollars

35:57.830 --> 36:01.039
and bought Richard this
for our first anniversary.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.749
He wore it every day.

36:03.750 --> 36:06.329
Later, in better times,
I bought new watches,

36:06.330 --> 36:11.540
expensive watches,
but no... he only wore this.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.420
Officer, thank you
for getting it back to me.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.669
Shift's over, Boot.

36:26.670 --> 36:28.829
No arrests.
Not even a parking ticket.

36:28.830 --> 36:31.749
What's your daddy gonna think?

36:31.750 --> 36:34.959
Honestly, I don't care.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.539
Really?

36:36.540 --> 36:38.119
Yeah.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.580
Today was a good day.

36:55.710 --> 36:57.669
End of shift, Boot.

36:57.670 --> 37:01.619
Don't you want to open
your evaluation? Why?

37:01.620 --> 37:03.289
Captain is probably
gonna fire me,

37:03.290 --> 37:05.669
so what does it even matter now?

37:05.670 --> 37:07.120
Just do it.

37:18.170 --> 37:22.419
"Officer Chen second-guessed
every decision she made."

37:22.420 --> 37:25.959
The whole point of me doing
this was to get under your skin.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.169
Clearly you did, sir.

37:27.170 --> 37:28.749
Yeah, until the end.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.039
Because when it really counted,
you didn't hesitate.

37:31.040 --> 37:34.039
You put it all on the line,
and you made the right call.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.579
Which really pisses me off

37:35.580 --> 37:38.120
because now I got to rewrite
the damn thing.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.580
Tim, what's gonna happen to me?

37:44.040 --> 37:46.290
Officer Chen, step inside.

37:51.120 --> 37:54.289
You told Mr. Acker, and I quote,

37:54.290 --> 37:57.579
"I will make you
my personal project."

37:57.580 --> 37:59.459
Nice. Kind of retro.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.669
Very 1990s Rampart scandal.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.169
I'm sorry, ma'am.
In today's LAPD...

38:04.170 --> 38:07.209
Especially in my house...
We don't threaten people.

38:07.210 --> 38:09.539
Not even the murderers.
Yes, ma'am.

38:09.540 --> 38:12.329
Those words do not reflect
the officer I am

38:12.330 --> 38:13.920
or the one I wish to be.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.619
Fine.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.499
You may go.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.039
Ma'am?

38:22.040 --> 38:24.669
So, I'm... still in the program?

38:24.670 --> 38:26.619
Internal Affairs reached out.

38:26.620 --> 38:28.959
They wanted my take
on this complaint.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.499
I'll recommend that
they close it out

38:30.500 --> 38:32.959
based on the circumstances.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.379
Thank you, ma'am... Don't.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.539
Because if you ever
let this job down again,

38:36.540 --> 38:38.579
I will not hesitate to
put you on a career path

38:38.580 --> 38:40.709
far away from the LAPD.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.210
Do you understand?

38:44.040 --> 38:46.209
Dismissed.

38:46.210 --> 38:47.879
Officer Bradford!

38:47.880 --> 38:49.170
Your turn.

38:52.380 --> 38:55.169
Yeah, three more,
thank you. Perfect.

38:55.170 --> 38:56.829
Can I get two drafts, Mickey?

38:56.830 --> 38:58.119
You got it, Talia.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.329
Thanks. Hey.

38:59.330 --> 39:00.669
Hey.

39:00.670 --> 39:03.419
Hell of a day. Yes.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.579
And I really should've stopped
and talked to that woman

39:06.580 --> 39:08.619
instead of brushing her off
with a business card.

39:08.620 --> 39:11.829
I-I was just so focused on
being seen as a man of action

39:11.830 --> 39:14.829
rather than some cop
halfway out to pasture.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.919
You want my advice? Please.

39:17.920 --> 39:21.329
Stop trying to be like the other
rookies, 'cause you're not.

39:21.330 --> 39:24.039
Jackson is 20 years from
having his first colonoscopy,

39:24.040 --> 39:26.959
and Lucy has never even owned
a pet, let alone raised a kid.

39:26.960 --> 39:29.499
You're a grown man,
fully formed.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.459
So stop treating it
like it's a liability

39:31.460 --> 39:34.419
and treat it like what it is...
A strength.

39:34.420 --> 39:38.499
Sure, you can be annoying,
and you talk way too damn much.

39:38.500 --> 39:41.669
But you also listen.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.999
To people's troubles,
to their complaints,

39:45.000 --> 39:47.959
and that type of empathy
can't be taught.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.789
Only earned.

39:49.790 --> 39:52.539
So if you really want
to make detective,

39:52.540 --> 39:54.710
the only way to do it
is to be you.

39:56.750 --> 39:59.329
So, what you're saying is,

39:59.330 --> 40:02.249
I've got a shot
at being detective.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.999
Good night, Officer Nolan.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.039
Good night, Officer Bishop.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.380
Order's up.

40:07.830 --> 40:10.329
Hey. Hey.

40:10.330 --> 40:11.959
I messed up at lunch.

40:11.960 --> 40:13.789
Sure did. Yeah.

40:13.790 --> 40:17.619
You were just being kind, and I
hit on you, and I apologize.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.249
It's just... you were there
when Vestri died.

40:20.250 --> 40:22.329
The guy had three bullets in
him, and all he cared about

40:22.330 --> 40:24.829
was helping you
drag my ass to cover.

40:24.830 --> 40:27.169
And I'll never know if
the stress of him doing that

40:27.170 --> 40:28.329
is what pushed that bullet

40:28.330 --> 40:31.119
the last quarter-inch
into his heart.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.209
He did that because
you were in trouble,

40:33.210 --> 40:35.249
and he was your partner.

40:35.250 --> 40:38.119
And it's only natural for you
to need to connect

40:38.120 --> 40:41.959
with someone who shared
a tragedy like that.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.750
So you forgive me?

40:45.540 --> 40:48.210
I mean, I don't blame you
for being attracted to me.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.619
Okay. So it's like that?

40:54.620 --> 40:58.829
If you ever need to talk,
I'm here.

40:58.830 --> 41:01.789
No strings attached.

41:01.790 --> 41:03.169
Look at you... Order's up.

41:03.170 --> 41:05.579
Saving my ass one more time.

41:05.580 --> 41:08.120
What can I say? I'm a giver.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.419
Sucks you didn't get
a crack at your father's record.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.959
Well, it doesn't matter.

41:15.960 --> 41:18.499
Yeah, breaking records
and making the most arrests...

41:18.500 --> 41:20.669
Not why I became a cop.

41:20.670 --> 41:22.039
You?

41:22.040 --> 41:24.209
Me?
I'm in it for the wool pants.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.539
Okay.

41:25.540 --> 41:28.289
Now it is time for
our "to me" toast.

41:28.290 --> 41:32.119
To me, no longer being crushed
by my father's shadow.

41:32.120 --> 41:36.329
To me, not having to apply to be
a mall cop in the morning.

41:36.330 --> 41:38.829
To me...

41:38.830 --> 41:40.329
Honestly, guys, I got nothing.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.079
Unlike you, I had a perfect day.

41:42.080 --> 41:43.710
Cheers.

41:47.750 --> 41:49.329
All right, now,
if you'll excuse me,

41:49.330 --> 41:51.330
I got something I gotta do.

41:52.830 --> 41:54.079
Before I leave,
Officer Bradford,

41:54.080 --> 41:55.669
I just wanted to give you this.

41:55.670 --> 41:58.289
It's my evaluation of you.

41:58.290 --> 42:00.039
That's not how it works, Boot.

42:00.040 --> 42:03.750
Yeah, well, if you don't want
to read it, don't.

42:06.380 --> 42:08.080
You gonna open it?

42:09.580 --> 42:11.619
Hey, get your stuff
together. We got to go.

42:11.620 --> 42:13.039
We got to go. Let's go, let's go.
What?

42:13.040 --> 42:15.579
Come on.

42:15.580 --> 42:16.879
What is it?

42:16.880 --> 42:18.250
Their bar tab.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.750
That little...
