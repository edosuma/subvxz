-Ow! Sorry! Sorry.
-Oh!

00:27.200 --> 00:28.080
Uh...

00:28.840 --> 00:30.120
Did I do something wrong?

00:30.480 --> 00:31.400
No.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.840
It's not you, it's me.
I have something called vaginismus.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.600
My vagina's like a Venus flytrap.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.800
If it makes you feel any better,
I've got one hairy nipple.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.800
Can you cure it, the vaginismus?

00:55.240 --> 00:56.440
Apparently, if I'm patient,

00:56.520 --> 00:58.320
I'll eventually be able
to get the big one in,

00:58.400 --> 01:01.240
but for now,
I can just get little Thumbelina up there.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.560
Do you know why you have it?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.840
I think it's because
I put too much pressure on myself.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.320
So, you can't even wank then?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.520
No, I do.  I do.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.480
I just keep to the outside.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.680
For some reason,
if I'm touching myself, then I'm okay.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.720
I have an idea.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.720
I'm coming!

01:55.080 --> 01:58.360
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

02:38.840 --> 02:39.880
Good morning.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.120
Good morning.

02:44.240 --> 02:46.520
You know, Dad's still in the UK.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.520
He's on his book tour.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.080
Can we talk about this, please?

02:56.520 --> 02:58.400
Are you going to admit that you lied?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.720
Then I guess
we have nothing to talk about.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.480
Withholding of information
is not technically a lie.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.680
And implementing an avoidance strategy

03:13.760 --> 03:17.280
will only suppress your negative emotions
towards me, not make them dissipate.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.800
Oh, you're going to therapize me.
Go ahead.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.240
Have a seat.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.280
Show me your skills.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.560
I'm all ears.

03:28.920 --> 03:31.600
I think your overreaction
to this situation

03:31.680 --> 03:35.080
stems from your deep-rooted fear
of rejection.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.440
You've rejected Jakob,
now you're rejecting me.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.640
You didn't exactly accept Jakob.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.040
In fact, you made it
incredibly difficult for us.

03:44.120 --> 03:48.000
So, is your son's inability to form
an attachment with your ex-boyfriend

03:48.520 --> 03:50.240
the real reason you're so angry?

03:50.320 --> 03:51.160
No.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.520
I'm angry because my son is involved in
a highly unethical underground operation

03:57.600 --> 03:59.320
on school campus.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.920
And he is refusing to take ownership
for the severity of his actions.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.760
Fine. Okay, yes,
I spoke to people at school.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.480
I gave out some advice.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.680
You can't arrest me for talking to people.

04:12.760 --> 04:17.480
You don't invoice
for a casual conversation.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.240
It's wrong, Otis.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.040
Well, I don't think it is.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.640
I don't understand, Mum.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.920
We usually just talk these things through
and everything's fine.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.400
Why are you still so upset with me?

04:37.600 --> 04:41.360
Because I thought
I was raising you to be a man

04:41.440 --> 04:44.120
who took responsibility for his actions.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.920
And because,
as the primary carer in your life,

04:54.280 --> 04:56.240
I always get your worst.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.760
And I'm tired of it.

05:07.560 --> 05:09.400
It's not my fault Dad left.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.640
You're going to be late.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.400
Are you still coming
to see Eric's play tonight?

05:28.040 --> 05:31.480
I'm not exactly welcome on campus
at the minute.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.640
You shouldn't let them bully you.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.560
Oh. Ow.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.920
Oh, I've packed some clean clothes
and a couple of dinners for your father.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.520
Would you drop them over at school?
Please?

06:12.600 --> 06:13.760
For me.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.720
-Did you tell him about me getting fired?
-No.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.520
But someone probably will.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.080
Might be best to mention it.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.680
You'll find something
you're really good at soon.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.480
No. No, no, no, no.

06:41.560 --> 06:45.800
Oh, oh, okay. No, no, no, no. Not today.
Not today.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.360
-Okay?

06:47.440 --> 06:50.520
-Where have you been?
-I was outside having a fag.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.000
Okay, well, you can't leave her on her own
because she's three.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.720
Ugh, she's fine.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.400
Oh, my God. There you go.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.840
Actually, I need you to take her
after school.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.200
I've got a job interview.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.320
Well, I can't, can I?
I've got the NSQC finals.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.760
-I thought you were coming.
-Oh, shit. I totally forgot.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.760
I can't make it. Will they video it?

07:09.400 --> 07:11.360
Yeah, it's on telly.
That's the whole point.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.000
It's fine. Um, it's stupid anyway.
I'll take her to Cynthia's.

07:18.920 --> 07:21.480
Everything's dirty.
Why haven't you washed her clothes?

07:21.560 --> 07:23.680
Just put her in her fairy costume.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.040
Okay, fairy costume! Yeah! Here we go.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.760
Well done. That's it.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.120
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.640
Well, don't you look fancy.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.160
Come on then.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.120
- Be good.
-She reminds me of you as a kid.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.760
Always making trouble.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.000
-Why am I in trouble?
-You're not in trouble, Jeffrey.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.800
I said Maeve used to cause trouble
when she was little.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.560
You pissed on our doorstep once.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.240
Sorry.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.400
Well, your mum was never around
to look after you, was she?

08:15.800 --> 08:18.040
But that's all changed now, hasn't it?
Thank God.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.640
Bye, Els.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.480
You need to de-wax your ears, Jeffrey.

08:26.600 --> 08:27.720
Twat.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.640
Isaac, Body Slammer's here.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I think my mum is using again.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.040
Don't say I told you so.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.520
I wouldn't dream of it.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.240
I need you to do me a favor.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.640
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.280
-When will I see you play this?
-Oh, well,

08:59.360 --> 09:02.560
if you come to the musical tonight,
I'm in the band.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.160
-I thought it was a play.
-No. Uh...

09:06.080 --> 09:09.280
<i>Romeo and Juliet: The Musical.</i>

09:12.240 --> 09:14.360
This poster is very ugly.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.720
Don't you think it looks like they're in
a forest full of dicks?

09:19.480 --> 09:20.760
I hate musicals.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.880
No! You can't hate musicals.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.040
People who hate musicals have no soul.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.800
-What about <i>Hedwig?</i>
-I liked it.

09:27.880 --> 09:28.720
Uh-huh.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.760
-Until they started singing.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.000
Okay, well,
you don't have to come tonight.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.440
No, it's okay.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.000
I'll see it for you.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.280
Okay.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.880
-But please, I was a true lush and my--
-Stop it, Quentin.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.560
We have been over this.
You are not Romeo,

09:44.640 --> 09:47.160
-you will never be my Romeo.
-Oh, enough, Quentin.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.280
You're always there, all right?
Just fuck off!

09:49.360 --> 09:52.160
Okay, guys, this is it.
Opening night. Woo!

09:52.240 --> 09:55.600
This is what we've been working for.
Hugo, stay off the drugs.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.400
Florence, pick up some props.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.840
-I'm getting into character, sir.
-You can get into character

09:59.920 --> 10:02.320
whilst helping Jackson
with the octopus arms.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.120
Are you nervous about tonight?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.800
Nerves are for amateurs.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.560
Hey.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.080
-Are you going to the play tonight?
-Oh, yeah. Maybe after the finals.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.120
I forgot that was today. Good luck.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.560
How do I get you
to not be angry at me anymore?

10:28.960 --> 10:30.400
I'm not angry, Otis.

10:30.960 --> 10:31.920
I'm disappointed.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.640
Hey.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.160
I didn't think you'd wanna speak
to me again.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.600
I don't think you should drink alcohol
for a really long time.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.440
-I didn't mean to hurt you.
-Well, you did.

10:51.640 --> 10:52.680
But it's okay.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.840
Why do I always end up
pissing everyone off?

10:56.720 --> 10:59.000
I think you're always trying so hard
to be a good guy

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
that you end up not being a good guy.

11:02.560 --> 11:05.040
Like you're afraid
you'll turn into your dad or something.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.800
I think you might be right.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.080
Thank you.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.840
For what? Where are you going?

11:17.960 --> 11:21.640
Remember, guys,
today is about having fun. Cube away, Dex!

11:23.720 --> 11:25.400
But it's also really important
that we win.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.520
This is not a drill, guys.
This is the endgame.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.800
Understood?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.880
Wait. I made these for you.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.960
Oh. Thanks, Aimes.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.080
-What's with the rogue "R"?
-I had an extra cupcake.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.720
Oh, thanks.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.360
It's a picture of your face
when it's concentrating.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.680
Good luck. See you there.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.640
Is she trying to tell me something?

11:55.720 --> 11:58.760
Yeah, I think she's saying,
"I still love you, Steve,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.440
but I need some more time."

12:17.440 --> 12:19.320
Mum said to call
if you want anything else.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.560
-All right, bye.
-How is your mother?

12:26.840 --> 12:28.200
Do you think she misses me?

12:29.600 --> 12:30.600
I don't know, Dad.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.720
I think Madam misses you though.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.680
I was thinking
I could come back to school.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.520
I know I've missed out on a lot,
but I want to find something I'm good at.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.000
I don't want to work in that shop forever.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.400
Well, you haven't been fired yet.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.040
Wonders never cease.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.240
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's see, shall we?

13:09.440 --> 13:10.520
Adam, you can go now.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.120
Adam! Get out!

13:33.320 --> 13:34.280
Hi, Adam.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.520
How are you?

13:38.640 --> 13:42.800
My mum's divorcing my dad,
so he's sleeping in the school.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.120
Yeah, everyone kind of knows.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.760
I got fired from my job.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.200
Yeah.  Rahim told me.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.680
Sorry, man.

13:57.720 --> 13:59.160
Still play the French horn?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.560
I didn't think you knew what it was.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.480
Trombone sounded funny.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.920
- Eric, we're starting.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.720
It's the final rehearsal
for the musical tonight.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.200
You should come. I mean,

14:15.960 --> 14:18.960
-I'm sure musicals aren't your ting, but--
-Is it like <i>Frozen?</i>

14:20.240 --> 14:21.600
Because that was very sad.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.240
Yeah. Uh...
It's a bit like <i>Frozen.</i>

14:31.040 --> 14:31.880
It...

14:32.720 --> 14:35.640
kind of looks like they're snogging
in a forest full of dicks.

14:35.720 --> 14:37.440
That's exactly what I said!

14:37.520 --> 14:40.320
It's a forest full of dicks, man!

14:40.400 --> 14:42.160
-It's full of dicks!
-It's just mad.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.400
-I, uh... I better go.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.400
Yeah. Um...

14:53.040 --> 14:56.200
I...
I didn't mean what I said at the party...

14:57.240 --> 14:58.760
about people not liking you.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.040
I'm very easy to not like.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.720
I, uh...

15:04.640 --> 15:06.160
I understand that I hurt you.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.680
Okay.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.120
I just wanted you to know that.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.240
<i>What makes you think</i>
<i>you are perimenopausal?</i>

15:28.320 --> 15:32.880
Well, I've been feeling very tired
and sort of heavy.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.720
And I've had this intermittent tight...

15:37.240 --> 15:38.680
feeling around my chest.

15:38.760 --> 15:42.600
And, um, have there been
any big life changes recently?

15:43.120 --> 15:46.360
Well, yes.
I've, um, had some trouble at work,

15:46.440 --> 15:50.280
and, uh, well, my teenage son is...

15:51.840 --> 15:53.280
Well, he's a teenager.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.720
And things ended with a man I was seeing
but, you know,

15:58.800 --> 16:01.200
just ordinary, manageable life stuff.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.400
When did you break up with your partner?

16:04.080 --> 16:07.160
Uh, he wasn't my partner,
and I didn't break up with him.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.520
I... Well, I might have pushed him away.

16:10.600 --> 16:11.560
Um...

16:12.320 --> 16:14.360
And then I realized my mistake, and...

16:15.280 --> 16:18.440
I tried to make it right,
but apparently, it was too late.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.120
Oh.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.080
There's the feeling.

16:23.880 --> 16:28.200
And did this pain start
when this man broke things off with you?

16:29.640 --> 16:34.160
I mean, I'd... Yes, I might have noticed
the symptoms around that time, but...

16:35.480 --> 16:38.960
...perimenopause causes
surges in adrenaline, right? And--

16:39.040 --> 16:42.720
I think you might be suffering from
a broken heart.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.080
Well, that's ridiculous.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.800
I'm a sex and relationship therapist,
I'm sure I'd know if I was...

16:48.240 --> 16:50.360
suffering from a broken heart.

16:50.480 --> 16:53.600
And I've been a GP for over 20 years
and not long ago,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.880
I was hospitalized for a kidney infection
I didn't think I had.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.640
Right.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.320
Let's get some tests done
and put your mind at ease.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.440
<i>"The modern man is now lacking</i>
<i>a sense of pride</i>

17:13.520 --> 17:16.440
in his innate masculinity.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.320
How do we reclaim that pride?

17:19.400 --> 17:23.240
I believe it starts
with taking ownership of ourselves.

17:24.320 --> 17:27.600
How can we ever begin
a romantic relationship

17:27.680 --> 17:32.160
without first owning our own emotions?
The answer is...

17:32.720 --> 17:37.840
we can't. The first rule of owning oneself
is to live in the moment

17:38.440 --> 17:40.520
and practice the power

17:41.480 --> 17:42.560
of intention."

17:42.640 --> 17:43.640
Thank you.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.920
This guy is so full of shit.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.280
Thanks.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.800
-Hi. Name?
-Ben.

17:57.880 --> 17:58.720
Ben.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.680
-There you go. Hi, what's your name?
-Hey, Dad.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.640
Otis, uh, shouldn't you be in school?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.280
Yeah, I was, um... I was hoping
we could talk about something.

18:10.360 --> 18:14.720
Yeah, of course.
Just take a seat for half an hour. Yeah.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.680
-Could I grab a photograph, Dr. Milburn?
-Yes. Of course.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.000
- Brilliant, thank you.
- Thank you.

18:23.920 --> 18:27.280
Hi, Remi. That was fantastic.
Good job. Thank you very much.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.040
Hey.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.160
Hey, Erin. Erin, have you seen
my pet rabbit? It's gone missing.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.800
-No, I've not seen him.
-It's a her, actually.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.080
Did you know that female rabbits
are called does, and...

19:38.560 --> 19:40.800
-male rabbits are called bucks?
-No, didn't know that.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.360
-Yeah. It's all in this book called--
-I'm in a bit of a rush.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.760
I just came back
to get my cigarettes. I'm sorry, babe.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.800
-It's a really good book.
-That's weird.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.680
I could have swore I locked that.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.080
Fuck.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.840
Now...

20:13.520 --> 20:14.920
Hope you find your rabbit.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.000
Thank you kindly.

20:22.200 --> 20:23.240
They're here.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.080
That's Holly Crankshaw,
their team captain.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.600
She already won this competition
when she was 14.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.240
<i>♪ Don't you like ♪</i>

20:32.880 --> 20:34.520

20:44.560 --> 20:46.560
All right. Let's go.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.720
Yeah, hello. Hi, um...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.360
I need to report a child at risk.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.040
Yeah.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.520
Her parent is using drugs,
and she's unfit to care for her.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.120
-We're on in five minutes, Maeve.
-Yeah, I'll be there in a sec.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.080
Yeah.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.120
Yeah, it's my mother.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.600
The release of Dr. Milburn's notes
was quite serious.

21:41.680 --> 21:44.280
I can assure you we have the situation
completely under control.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.920
Ms. Milburn has been removed from campus,
and our students are no longer at risk.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.880
She was on campus to help us protect
our students.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.480
You managed to somehow make
a dire situation worse.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.040
That was an unfortunate blip.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.920
We are still a school
that prides itself on excellence.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.160
But...
...our best and brightest students

22:00.240 --> 22:02.400
are competing at the NSQC finals today,

22:02.480 --> 22:04.200
and you must stay
for the first performance

22:04.280 --> 22:06.560
of <i>Romeo and Juliet:</i> <i>The Musical</i> tonight.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.200
It's going to be quite an event.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.880
Is it just me, or does that forest
look like it's full of penises?

22:22.960 --> 22:24.720
Okay, standby, studio.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.160
Going in ten, nine,

22:27.240 --> 22:30.880
eight, seven, six,

22:30.960 --> 22:32.480
five, four...

22:40.800 --> 22:42.400
Good afternoon

22:42.480 --> 22:45.880
and welcome to the grand live final

22:45.960 --> 22:49.320
of the National Student Quiz Championship.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.240
On my left,
we have three-time previous champions,

22:52.320 --> 22:53.800
it's the Knowledge Knights.

23:00.280 --> 23:05.240
And on my right, fierce competitors
and wild cards, it's the Quiz Heads.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.520
Let's get straight down to it
with a round on Art History.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.680
So, question one...

23:21.800 --> 23:24.080
Here you go, one lemonade.

23:25.040 --> 23:25.880
So...

23:26.680 --> 23:28.560
what's this all about then, son?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.280
More girl trouble?

23:32.040 --> 23:33.120
Why did you leave...

23:33.920 --> 23:34.800
when I was a kid?

23:35.640 --> 23:39.240
Oh, your... your mother and I
were unhappy, and--

23:39.320 --> 23:42.120
Not why did you leave Mum,
why did you leave me?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.120
What's this really about?

23:46.480 --> 23:48.720
This is what this is really about, Dad.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.040
I thought everything was Mum's fault.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.680
That she was the reason I feel....

23:54.400 --> 23:55.560
confused.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.640
But at least she's there for me.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.080
Where were you?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.840
Well, I-I had to move to America
for work--

24:05.920 --> 24:08.560
No, you moved to America for yourself.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.160
Dad, please just stop lying.

24:12.240 --> 24:14.400
Hey, I have a feeling
there might be some...

24:15.120 --> 24:17.160
some inner conflict going on here.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.920
Yes, I feel angry...

24:19.520 --> 24:23.280
all the time, and I'm trying to find out
what kind of man I want to be,

24:23.360 --> 24:27.080
which is really hard when my dad
has been absent for most of my life.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.000
Did you not like me
as much as you thought you would?

24:31.080 --> 24:33.040
Of course I like you. I just...

24:35.880 --> 24:37.360
Then how could you leave me?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.480
Because I'm an arsehole.

24:49.320 --> 24:53.400
I'm sure there are multiple ways
of diagnosing my personality,

24:53.480 --> 24:56.320
but the chief ingredient is arsehole.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.200
How do I not become an arsehole?

25:10.480 --> 25:11.880
Just try and stay honest.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.240
'Cause once you start lying, it's...

25:19.640 --> 25:21.120
it's very hard to stop.

25:22.600 --> 25:23.920
You know, when you're young...

25:24.760 --> 25:29.200
you think that everybody out there
really... really gets you.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.320
But, you know, actually,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.040
only a handful of them do.

25:37.440 --> 25:43.160
All the people who like you,
despite your faults.

25:45.440 --> 25:50.160
And then if you discard them,
they will never come back.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.880
So, when you meet those people...

25:56.200 --> 25:58.120
you should just hold on to them.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.560
Really, really tightly.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.760
And don't let them go.

26:10.920 --> 26:15.120
And whatever else you do,
never read this fucking book.

26:18.800 --> 26:22.240
Hi, sorry. Could you...
could you sign my book?

26:24.800 --> 26:26.840
-Yeah.
- Oh, great. Thanks.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.320
-What's your name?
-Pete.

26:28.400 --> 26:29.920
Pete. Hi, Pete.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.520
-Here you go.
-Thank you. Big fan.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.520
Man up.

26:44.760 --> 26:46.760
<i>...as we head into</i>
<i>the Geography round.</i>

26:46.840 --> 26:51.000
<i>One minute on the clock and remember,</i>
<i>if you buzz, you must answer.</i>

26:51.680 --> 26:54.640
<i>The Volga river runs into which sea?</i>

26:54.720 --> 26:56.440
<i>The Caspian Sea.</i>

26:56.520 --> 27:00.520
<i>Correct.</i>
<i>What is the length of the English Channel?</i>

27:06.120 --> 27:08.760
<i>How many countries</i>
<i>begin with the letter...</i>

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
Hey, Maeve.

27:10.800 --> 27:16.360
I know you can't answer this right now
because I'm watching you on live TV.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.600
But I wanted you to know
how proud of you I am.

27:21.840 --> 27:24.240
And how unbelievably stupid I've been.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.000
-Is your uncle here?
-Yusef.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.080
I know you like my boyfriend.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.160
You make him laugh.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.480
He doesn't laugh like that with me.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.840
See you later, Yusef.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.920
She's still sitting. You taught her well.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.200
If you give me my job back,
I can teach her other things.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.680
How to give a high-five or do a sexy wink.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.920
Please, I know I made a mistake.
It won't happen again.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.640
Hello.

28:13.080 --> 28:13.920
Hi.

28:14.360 --> 28:19.160
-Why're you dressed like a very small man?
-Oh, I'm going to my school musical.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.200
Can I have my pay?

28:22.920 --> 28:25.800
-What are you doing here?
-Trying to get my job back.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.440
I want to go back to school,
but my dad can't find out I was fired.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.360
What happened to the shop
wasn't Adam's fault.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.240
The key wasn't working
last time I used it.

28:36.320 --> 28:38.800
I forgot to tell you. It was my fault.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.800
If you're gonna fire him,
you're gonna have to fire me too.

28:43.840 --> 28:44.800
This is true?

28:45.560 --> 28:46.400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:48.880 --> 28:49.760
Well,

28:50.240 --> 28:51.400
then you're both fired.

28:52.160 --> 28:54.520
Go on, get out of my shop. Go!

28:58.920 --> 29:00.000
Why did you do that?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.000
Because I love you, dude.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.320
Well, I know that I'm bisexual,
but I don't like you like that.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.040
I thought you were a lesbian now
or into kitchen stuff

29:08.120 --> 29:10.360
-or some shit?
-No, Adam, you idiot.

29:11.080 --> 29:14.040
You're my friend.
I love you like a friend.

29:17.600 --> 29:18.440
Are you okay?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.840
No one's ever said
I was their friend before.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.400
You can put me down now.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.920
<i>♪ Never change, never change</i>
<i>Never change, never change ♪</i>

29:37.000 --> 29:43.520
<i>♪ Never change, never change, never change</i>
<i>This is why I fell in love ♪</i>

29:46.920 --> 29:49.440
-Five hundred and sixty kilometers.
-Is the right answer.

29:49.840 --> 29:52.760
In which city
is the world's busiest airport?

29:53.200 --> 29:55.480
-Atlanta, Georgia, USA.
-Correct.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.200
Which country is home to two cities that
have a population of over one million,

30:00.280 --> 30:03.360
but whose names are anagrams
of one another?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.600
- It's Japan.
- No conferring.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.840
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to dock you five points

30:16.920 --> 30:19.400
and pass the question over
to the Knowledge Knights.

30:20.480 --> 30:22.760
-Japan.
-Can you name the two cities?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.560
Tokyo and Kyoto.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.800
Is absolutely right,
and that's the end of this round.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.320
We'll see you after these messages.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.040
They're destroying us.

30:40.400 --> 30:42.080
Uh, maybe we should just give up.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.880
We're not giving up. We came here to win.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.520
And if we're not gonna win,
at least we're gonna fight.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.080
Do you understand me?
Like, we are the Quiz Heads,

30:51.160 --> 30:53.960
and we are exceptional.
And more important than that,

30:54.840 --> 30:55.680
we're a team.

30:56.640 --> 30:59.480
So, if we're gonna go down,
we're gonna go down together.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.840
Sorry, you kind of
turned into <i>Braveheart </i>there.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.240
-I love that film.
-Pull yourself together, Steve.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.880
And all of you, play to your strengths.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.600
-What are we?
- The Quiz Heads.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.520
The Quiz Heads.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.280
Turns out you were right,
you're perimenopausal.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.120
You're also pregnant.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.440
What?

31:30.640 --> 31:32.760
Well, that's impossible.

31:32.840 --> 31:33.760
Well, you are.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.000
But he had a vasectomy.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.800
Stranger things have happened.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.880
You're pregnant, Jean.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.320
Well, that makes
the whole heartbreak thing

31:53.400 --> 31:55.000
so much more complicated.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.040
Mm.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.040
-The tangent function.
-Absolutely right.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.800
-Optimus Prime.
-Correct again.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.640
George Eliot.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.400
Charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.240
Dorothy Gish.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.560
Jonathan Jamal Jennings.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.640
-The Magic Cube.
-Yes!

32:19.720 --> 32:20.760
-Percy Pigs.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.320
<i>The Critique of Pure Reason</i>
by Immanuel Kant.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.400
Absolutely right.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.760
And mu, M-U, is an example--

32:28.840 --> 32:32.400
Oh, that sound means
this must be our last question.

32:32.480 --> 32:36.360
-All right mu, M-U, is an example of a--

32:37.760 --> 32:38.960
A sound a cat makes.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.120
I'm afraid I can't accept that,
Knowledge Knights, no.

32:42.200 --> 32:44.040
Mu, M-U, is?

32:44.800 --> 32:48.360
Population parameter. In statistics,
a parameter is any summary number,

32:48.440 --> 32:51.880
such as an average or a percentage,
that describes an entire population.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.800
I would have accepted
a population parameter.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.200
That is absolutely
the full and correct answer.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.760
And with that incredible recovery,
I can announce

33:01.240 --> 33:08.240
that our NSQC UK champions of the year,
with a score of 89 to 88 are...

33:09.040 --> 33:11.000
-the Quiz Heads!
-Yes!

33:16.040 --> 33:16.920
Whoa!

33:23.320 --> 33:24.720
Congratulations.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.280
Thank you.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.800
Didn't think you could make it.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.360
I can get another job interview,
I wasn't gonna miss this.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.560
-Mum, listen, I need to--
-No. No, come on.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.960
I'll treat you to a strawberry milkshake
on the way home. Come on.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.440
-Maybe we could hang out tonight?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.880
I don't think I want to have sex yet.

33:46.960 --> 33:49.600
We don't have to have sex ever again,
I just miss talking to you.

33:49.680 --> 33:51.680
It's gonna be so cringe.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.760
-Hey, Viv. Are you coming too?
-Where?

33:53.840 --> 33:56.360
To watch Jackson Marchetti
make an absolute tit of himself.

33:56.440 --> 33:57.440
That's not funny.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.720
- Come on. He's an idiot jock.
-He's not an idiot.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.160
He's trying something new
that he might not be very good at,

34:03.240 --> 34:04.200
which is brave.

34:04.280 --> 34:07.560
Whereas you do one thing really well,
and you never shut up about it.

34:07.640 --> 34:11.680
If you're referring to
my Rubik's cube, I don't just do it well,

34:12.280 --> 34:14.680
-I'm actually the 28th best--
-We know, Dex, we know.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.200
We do kind of know, man.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.640
-Half an hour until curtain, guys.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.960
Elbow, elbow, up, down,
twist, twist, up, down,

34:25.040 --> 34:28.680
and pop it, and pop it.
Not at me, I'm faculty.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.000
You got a problem, Quentin?

34:35.320 --> 34:37.880
I'm surprised you came, Ms. Milburn.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.040
I still have a child
at the school, Mr. Groff.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.920
I'm here as a parent.

34:45.720 --> 34:47.520
I'm so proud of you, Froggy.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.440
-Don't say that.
-No, I'm serious.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.360
I know I've messed up so much,
and missed so many things,

34:52.440 --> 34:54.440
but I'm never losing you again.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.640
What's going on?

35:00.640 --> 35:02.320
We're with Social Services.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.240
There's been a report of drug use
in the presence of a minor.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.200
Who reported it? Did you do this?

35:07.280 --> 35:08.640
I didn't know they were coming.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.520
Someone's reported something,
haven't they? And it's bullshit.

35:11.600 --> 35:12.920
It's not bullshit, Mum.

35:17.600 --> 35:18.880
You did this?

35:20.240 --> 35:22.440
I know you've been using again,
so don't lie.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.200
She's not safe.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.600
I slipped... once.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.440
It was a mistake.

35:30.240 --> 35:32.640
I'm in a program, they can help me.

35:34.320 --> 35:36.640
-You can't take my kid.
-We're not taking her anywhere,

35:36.720 --> 35:38.800
we need to look inside the caravan
if that's all right.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.200
-Stay away from my caravan!
-I'm sure we can sort this out,

35:41.280 --> 35:43.040
-but we need to have a look inside.
-Mum!

35:43.120 --> 35:45.280
We'll have to call the police
if you make a scene.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.440
-Let them look inside--
-Stay the fuck away from me!

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
Don't touch me!

35:51.480 --> 35:52.600
How could you?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.520
How could you do this to me?

35:58.760 --> 35:59.960
Here.

36:05.800 --> 36:06.680
Here.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.400
You take her things.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.120
You say you're not going to take her...

36:16.200 --> 36:17.240
but you're lying.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.520
You're fucking lying.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.400
There's a hostile resident
not cooperating.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.880
We need assistance.

36:39.480 --> 36:42.200
-I don't know if I need a bow tie.
-You look very nice.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.600
Nice suit.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.000
Yeah, she's all dressed up
for her new girlfriend.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.000
Shut up, Dad.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.960
Well, what's the problem?
I thought you were broken up with him.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.080
Yeah, I'm kind of dating Lily now.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.360
I didn't want to make it awkward.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.640
It's not awkward.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.320
That's... That's great.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.680
Young people are strange, so, come on.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.480
Actually, could I have a...

37:06.320 --> 37:08.440
I wanted to apologize properly

37:09.000 --> 37:11.520
for making things difficult
between you and my mum.

37:12.040 --> 37:16.080
I found not being her number one priority
harder than I expected.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.440
It was very immature of me.

37:19.680 --> 37:21.360
Sorry for being an arsehole.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.080
Yeah...

37:24.120 --> 37:25.600
you are a bit of an arsehole.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.360
But you're also a good man, Otis.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.880
Do you think so?

37:34.520 --> 37:35.400
I know so.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.320
Shall we?

37:38.960 --> 37:42.160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please take your seats</i>

37:42.240 --> 37:45.400
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage</i>

37:45.480 --> 37:47.120
-Hey. You okay?
-Yeah.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.280
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please take your seats</i>

37:52.360 --> 37:55.960
<i>and prepare for your erotic voyage</i>
<i>to the planet of Verona.</i>

38:06.200 --> 38:08.440
I thought this was Shakespeare?

38:09.280 --> 38:14.520
Uh, yes. I think our students are taking
a postmodern approach.

38:15.360 --> 38:16.600
Stand by.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.520
-Sorry.
-Sir, I can't go on stage.

38:40.600 --> 38:42.560
-I'm gonna humiliate myself.
-Jackson, babe.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.520
-You're not a great actor...
-Yeah.

38:44.600 --> 38:45.560
...yet.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.960
The most important thing is
you're doing something you enjoy.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.800
Maybe you're not nervous at all.
Maybe you're just super-duper pumped.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.640
Okay? Doosh, doosh.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.440
-It's not in there, is it?
-No.

38:56.320 --> 38:57.320
Enter Carl.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.560
Two households, both alike in dignity,

39:09.960 --> 39:12.480
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.280
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

39:17.000 --> 39:20.840
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

39:22.280 --> 39:26.360
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes,

39:26.440 --> 39:29.360
a pair of star-crossed lovers

39:29.440 --> 39:31.640
take their life.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.280
Mum...

39:41.920 --> 39:44.280
Mum, please talk to me. Come on.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.800
I will never forgive you.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.120
Never.

39:52.720 --> 39:53.840
Come on, darling.

40:15.600 --> 40:18.360
-You look nice, Mum.
-Something new I'm trying.

40:21.120 --> 40:22.880
Is everything all right at school?

40:22.960 --> 40:24.040
How was your father?

40:25.480 --> 40:26.360
Not good.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.280
Maybe we could....

40:29.960 --> 40:31.200
let him come back?

40:31.640 --> 40:32.760
Oh, darling.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.360
Your father needed to fight for us
a very long time ago.

40:38.640 --> 40:39.680
What do you mean?

40:40.880 --> 40:42.560
When you love a person,

40:43.560 --> 40:46.320
there's always a tiny part of you
that's terrified that one day

40:46.400 --> 40:47.720
you're gonna lose them.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.480
And I think that your father's so scared
of that emotion that...

40:52.040 --> 40:54.240
he stops himself feeling anything at all.

40:57.320 --> 41:00.480
But you have to let the people you love
know that you love them,

41:00.960 --> 41:03.240
even if it causes you
a great deal of pain.

41:03.960 --> 41:04.840
Why?

41:06.600 --> 41:07.680
It sounds awful.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.200
Because you're alive.

41:19.720 --> 41:20.600
I have to go.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.360
See...

41:24.800 --> 41:25.800
where he comes.

41:26.240 --> 41:30.960
So please you, step aside.
I'll know his grievance or be much denied.

41:31.040 --> 41:32.760
Come, madam. Let's away.

41:39.480 --> 41:41.520
-Shit.
- Good morrow, cousin!

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Fuck.

41:43.840 --> 41:44.960
Good morrow, cousin!

41:45.640 --> 41:47.480
Colin, does anyone have eyes on Jackson?

41:48.840 --> 41:51.640
-Jackson, that's your cue.
- I'll go back on.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.880
I know all the lines.

41:53.960 --> 41:57.640
Shut the fuck up, Quentin,
you piece of shit. Jesus Christ.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.040
- Good morrow, cousin!
-Get on stage, now!

42:00.120 --> 42:02.320
And remember, you're not nervous,
you're just excited. Go!

42:02.400 --> 42:03.360
Sir!

42:16.760 --> 42:19.160
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.760
Get on with it!

42:37.880 --> 42:39.760
Good morrow, cousin!

42:42.320 --> 42:43.880
Is the day so young?

42:44.680 --> 42:46.440
Get back in the pool, Marchetti.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.320
Uh...

42:53.400 --> 42:54.440
Jackson.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.400
Is the day so young?

42:58.240 --> 42:59.920
Is the day so young?

43:00.000 --> 43:01.360
Is the day so young?

43:04.040 --> 43:06.920
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

43:07.720 --> 43:10.920
-Remember the heartbeats.
-What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

43:11.000 --> 43:14.040
Uh, I am out of her favor,
where I am in love.

43:14.640 --> 43:18.680
Alas, she is too fair, too wise.
Does thou not laugh?

43:18.760 --> 43:22.320
-Good Romeo, forget to think of her!
-Oh, teach me how

43:22.400 --> 43:25.320
-I should forget to think. Her beauty is--
-Peace!

43:25.960 --> 43:27.680
Our cousin Mercutio draws near.

43:28.760 --> 43:30.920
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.040
Cue Mercutio. Cue Mercutio.

Be that as it may--

47:44.560 --> 47:45.480
Adam!

47:46.640 --> 47:47.760
All right, Dad.

47:56.480 --> 47:57.800
Go, go, go, go, go!

47:57.880 --> 47:59.240
Wait, that's my vagina!

47:59.320 --> 48:00.600
Calmly, sir, please?

48:00.680 --> 48:03.440
They have vaginas on their heads!

48:13.360 --> 48:15.400
And standby, spunk.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.840
Groff is coming on. He's on.

48:20.720 --> 48:24.800
Stop the show! Stop! The show is over.

48:25.440 --> 48:28.600
Why are the Groffs ruining my show?
Colin. Colin.

48:28.680 --> 48:31.240
- But we are enjoying it!
- Yeah.

48:31.320 --> 48:33.200
You're enjoying this filth!

48:33.600 --> 48:35.120
Well, it's supposed to be funny, sir.

48:37.720 --> 48:38.680
You...

48:39.720 --> 48:41.360
have all been corrupted...

48:42.600 --> 48:45.360
-by this woman!

48:47.000 --> 48:49.080
She's giving sex advice to your children,

48:49.160 --> 48:51.600
filling their heads
with dangerous nonsense.

48:51.680 --> 48:53.440
No, that's not entirely true.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.040
She was explicitly told
she was not here as a counselor.

48:56.120 --> 48:57.800
I had no idea she'd be so unprofessional.

48:57.880 --> 49:00.600
-Mr. Groff.
-Okay. She wasn't giving out sex advice.

49:02.760 --> 49:03.760
I was.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.280
And I shouldn't have been
'cause I'm 16 years old, and...

49:07.640 --> 49:09.320
well, I've only had sex once.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.200
Wasn't even very good, apparently, but...

49:13.320 --> 49:15.600
But my mum was here
to listen to your problems

49:15.680 --> 49:19.000
and give you the advice that
the school should have been giving anyway.

49:19.080 --> 49:19.920
What?

49:20.600 --> 49:22.960
My mum is an excellent therapist,

49:23.400 --> 49:26.640
and she cares about people.
She only wants what's best for them.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.440
Which is why
she's also such an amazing parent.

49:33.360 --> 49:34.880
Well, that's ridiculous.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.640
She reassured me that my labia
is a normal length.

49:38.720 --> 49:41.720
And she really helped me accept myself.
It's changed my life.

49:42.720 --> 49:46.040
I fucked some warm fruit
and she said I wasn't weird.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.200
They're children, for God's sake!

49:50.400 --> 49:52.400
They don't know what they want.

49:53.800 --> 49:56.600
-This is all your fault.
-Mr. Groff.

49:57.320 --> 49:59.000
I need to see you outside.

50:00.200 --> 50:01.120
Immediately.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.000
It's completely ruined.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.880
It was meant to be perfect.

50:19.560 --> 50:21.760
Well, I think it was perfect.

50:28.840 --> 50:31.080
Have you completely lost your mind?

50:31.160 --> 50:33.440
-That woman is--
-That woman nothing, Michael.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.960
I know your wife has left you,
and you've been sleeping at the school.

50:40.040 --> 50:42.960
You're clearly not coping very well,
and you need to take some time off.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.240
I'm fine.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.440
It's not a request.
You will take leave as of today.
