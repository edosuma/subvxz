WEBVTT

00:05.458 --> 00:08.750
<i>Do I dare ask what
calamity must have transpired</i>

00:08.750 --> 00:10.916
to bring you home to me?

00:14.958 --> 00:18.000
How do you explain
Mr. Fury's presence in Moscow?

00:18.166 --> 00:20.750
They sent you to fire me?

00:21.291 --> 00:22.333
I volunteered.

00:22.333 --> 00:25.041
That mess that you created in Moscow
that resulted in getting

00:25.041 --> 00:27.416
<i>- one of our best people murdered?</i>

00:27.416 --> 00:29.458
You earned all this smoke, brother.

00:30.125 --> 00:31.333
<i>At the Council meeting,</i>

00:31.333 --> 00:34.500
I told you I had a plan
for taking Earth as our own.

00:35.916 --> 00:37.958
<i>The heroes of Earth will react.</i>

00:38.583 --> 00:43.333
<i>The only way we can counter that
is to become super ourselves.</i>

00:44.041 --> 00:45.041
<i>All of us.</i>

00:45.666 --> 00:46.875
Super Skrulls.

00:47.041 --> 00:48.041
<i>G'iah.</i>

00:48.208 --> 00:49.250
Run.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.166
- Go on, turn around.
- G'IAH: No.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.333
Are you a leader of Skrulls

00:59.250 --> 01:00.375
or our worst enemy?

01:08.583 --> 01:10.208
<i>St. James Church,
one hour.</i>

05:01.916 --> 05:05.833
As I was watching all the news coverage
of those guys'

05:05.833 --> 05:09.041
heroics over in the States,
strangest thing,

05:09.291 --> 05:11.250
I kept having this feeling

05:11.250 --> 05:15.125
that someone I know had something to do
with getting them all together.

05:17.916 --> 05:21.125
And what if it was someone you know?

05:22.125 --> 05:23.333
Wouldn't surprise me.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.166
Why is that?

05:25.875 --> 05:30.750
Because if he's the man I think he is,
he has a powerful sense of righteousness.

05:32.541 --> 05:37.208
He understands that the universe
is a dangerous place.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.375
That home is worth fighting for.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.291
And that the weak are worth protecting.

05:49.625 --> 05:50.625
Good book?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.333
It's a collection of poems.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.083
Raymond Carver.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.500
- You familiar?
- Nah. More of a history guy myself.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.791
He's known for his brevity.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.500
I mean, some of his poems
are just three or four lines,

06:07.041 --> 06:09.500
but they pack a punch.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.041
Do you have a favorite?

06:12.291 --> 06:13.750
It's called <i>Late Fragment.</i>

06:13.916 --> 06:15.125
Hmm. How's it go?

06:17.583 --> 06:18.666
Uh...

06:19.250 --> 06:23.875
Actually, it's a conversation
between two people.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.458
You read the first line.

06:31.750 --> 06:35.916
"And did you get
what you wanted from this life,

06:36.541 --> 06:37.750
"even so?"

06:40.500 --> 06:41.500
"I did."

06:43.125 --> 06:44.583
"And what did you want?"

06:46.875 --> 06:49.375
"To call myself beloved,

06:50.541 --> 06:54.333
"to feel myself beloved on the earth."

07:52.000 --> 07:55.208
- Fury was fired a couple of days ago.
- Fired?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.500
How'd that happen?

07:57.833 --> 08:00.333
President Ritson must have found out
he was in Moscow.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.666
President Ritson
doesn't find out that the sun's come up

08:03.833 --> 08:04.833
unless I brief him.

08:04.833 --> 08:07.208
I fired Fury, okay?

08:07.208 --> 08:10.416
No, I'm sorry, correction,
I DDT'd that dude from the top rope.

08:11.083 --> 08:14.250
Yeah, it was like Undertaker level.
It was really impressive.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.458
I don't understand. If it was you...

08:19.125 --> 08:21.750
If it was Gravik,
then why does he need me?

08:21.750 --> 08:24.416
What Gravik needs,
what Gravik doesn't need,

08:24.416 --> 08:26.000
that's none of your concern.

08:26.666 --> 08:28.625
I'm the one telling you to kill Fury.

08:32.708 --> 08:33.916
I'll make it easy for you.

08:33.916 --> 08:37.583
<i>One of the two occupants
of that lovely country manor of yours</i>

08:38.041 --> 08:39.583
<i>is catching a bullet today.</i>

08:40.875 --> 08:42.791
You can flip a coin for all I care.

08:47.833 --> 08:49.166
He's broken.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.958
He's been broken
ever since he came back from the Blip.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.791
The old Fury, the one with power,

08:54.791 --> 08:58.791
<i>the one with ability,
the one who was indispensable to us,</i>

08:59.333 --> 09:00.916
<i>that Fury's gone.</i>

09:00.916 --> 09:02.291
<i>Now this new one,</i>

09:02.666 --> 09:05.833
<i>he'll be dead from exhaustion
and defeat soon enough.</i>

09:05.833 --> 09:07.625
<i>We don't need to kill him.</i>

09:09.000 --> 09:10.083
Priscilla.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.166
You keep telling me
what you're not gonna do,

09:20.833 --> 09:23.208
I'm gonna show you what I am going to.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.333
Now you enjoy this concert.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.041
We have a problem.

09:43.958 --> 09:44.958
Oh, yeah?

09:44.958 --> 09:46.125
What's that?

09:46.125 --> 09:49.166
Take a look around, G.
There's a reason G'iah isn't here with us.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.750
She's the mole.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.125
I've already taken care of her.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.583
Yes, sir.

09:55.791 --> 09:58.791
Hey! Remember, we want them to think
it's the Russians.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.166
Make it big, loud,
like the Russians would.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.750
Yeah, that's cargo only.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
Steady now.

10:20.125 --> 10:25.958
I should never ever
have forced you into this,

10:25.958 --> 10:27.875
and I am so sorry.

10:27.875 --> 10:31.500
I don't need your sorrow or pity
for anything I did of my own free will.

10:40.958 --> 10:42.416
The reason I'm with you now

10:42.416 --> 10:46.333
is because with you, Dad...

10:49.875 --> 10:52.666
It's the only answer
to the question of where I belong.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.833
The only thing that I need from you

10:56.916 --> 10:58.083
is a plan.

11:01.708 --> 11:02.833
Once and for all, Dad,

11:04.916 --> 11:07.916
what is your plan
for finding our people a home?

11:07.916 --> 11:10.208
Because Gravik
has already implemented his,

11:10.208 --> 11:11.541
and it works.

11:12.833 --> 11:13.916
Okay.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.750
First, we take down the insurgency.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.291
You, me, Fury.

11:21.291 --> 11:24.708
Once that's done, we go to the President.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.958
And we have a big bargaining chip.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.208
And we tell him,

11:30.208 --> 11:35.500
"Guess what? Just saved your planet.
Now give me a little something in return."

11:35.958 --> 11:38.875
And we wait and see what can happen next.
All right?

11:38.875 --> 11:43.500
And I believe that I can secure an amnesty

11:43.500 --> 11:45.875
for the one million of us to remain.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.333
Don't you want to live in your own skin?

11:50.500 --> 11:52.125
Of course I do.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.416
But we have to deal with reality.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.416
G'iah, we're a people without a planet.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.458
We depend on the goodwill of our hosts.

12:04.541 --> 12:08.541
We just have to keep showing them
who we are.

12:09.041 --> 12:13.083
We just keep contributing,
show them our hearts.

12:13.625 --> 12:15.708
They will see us.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.083
You are delusional.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.750
That's not who we are.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.625
And that is not who I've become.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.750
G'iah.

12:41.166 --> 12:42.416
G'iah!

13:20.416 --> 13:24.333
- Didn't think you'd be home until later.
- Surprise.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.208
- Tea?
- Sure, I'll take a cup.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.583
What's the matter? Your fingers swell up?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.083
You're not wearing your wedding ring.

13:36.791 --> 13:37.875
Oh!

13:37.875 --> 13:40.125
Came in the back way, slipped my mind.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.666
Does that mean you're coming or going?

13:43.666 --> 13:45.750
Going.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.083
One of those
"Fury, we need you at work" things.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.375
- Know what I mean?
- I know how it is.

14:19.208 --> 14:23.666
Of all the dumbass, wrongheaded,

14:24.041 --> 14:28.666
reckless things I've done in my life,

14:30.791 --> 14:35.375
you are by far and away

14:36.208 --> 14:39.416
the greatest mistake.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.208
I lost all my reason to be your husband.

14:50.500 --> 14:54.708
Ignored every signal
in my head, heart and body

14:54.708 --> 14:57.916
that screamed, "Stop!"

15:03.250 --> 15:05.625
Even now, as I sit here,

15:05.625 --> 15:09.916
knowing you plan to kill me
with that pistol of yours,

15:13.458 --> 15:16.875
I don't know that if I had a chance
to do it over again,

15:16.875 --> 15:18.750
that I'd do anything different.

15:37.583 --> 15:40.583
Would you tell me the story? About how you

15:42.666 --> 15:43.875
chose her?

15:49.291 --> 15:52.791
Dr. Priscilla Davis
had a congenital heart defect.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.791
She was keeping it a secret.

15:55.958 --> 16:00.000
Didn't want the people she loved
gathered around for months,

16:00.958 --> 16:02.708
watching her die in a hospital.

16:03.583 --> 16:07.208
And I would visit her in her room
almost every day towards the end,

16:07.833 --> 16:09.541
and we became quite close.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.125
But at some point,

16:12.958 --> 16:14.791
I had to acknowledge the truth of

16:15.708 --> 16:17.791
what I was actually doing there

16:17.791 --> 16:20.041
- in the first place.
- Which was?

16:21.166 --> 16:24.041
Looking for someone
who would slip your defenses.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.791
Ah.

16:26.458 --> 16:29.291
So you were playing the long game on me,
even then.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.708
Don't do that, Nick.

16:33.125 --> 16:37.791
One day the doctor came in and told me
that it would be just a matter of hours.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.541
I decided to just come out and ask.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.416
You asked if you could assume her life?

16:48.333 --> 16:50.250
I asked if she wanted to fall in love.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.208
She wanted to know how, of course.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.416
And I told her about you.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.166
She made me make her three promises.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.083
One,

17:03.750 --> 17:06.416
that I would bury her at sea, which I did.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.125
Two,

17:11.583 --> 17:14.125
that I would continue
to be a daughter to her parents.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.583
- Which you've also done.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.083
Three?

17:27.375 --> 17:29.166
That I would never hurt you.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.791
Sorry, darling.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.333
"And did you get

17:46.125 --> 17:49.875
"what you wanted from this life, even so?"

17:54.166 --> 17:55.291
"I did."

17:57.500 --> 17:59.125
"And what did you want?"

18:04.125 --> 18:06.125
"To call myself beloved."

18:10.375 --> 18:13.291
-"To feel myself...
-"Myself...

18:13.791 --> 18:19.500
-"...beloved on the earth"
-"...beloved on the earth."

18:33.333 --> 18:37.541
I'm not sure if this means
we should get divorced,

18:37.541 --> 18:39.333
or we should renew our vows.

18:43.541 --> 18:45.041
They'll be coming for you.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.041
I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself.

18:56.291 --> 18:59.000
Would you have loved me
if I'd never changed?

18:59.750 --> 19:01.541
If I'd been my true self?

19:20.958 --> 19:22.375
Guess we'll never know.

20:07.583 --> 20:08.750
Fury, what the hell?

20:09.708 --> 20:12.166
You mind telling me
what the hell you're doing in here?

20:12.166 --> 20:15.500
Memory serves, I shit-canned you
into oblivion a few days ago.

20:17.958 --> 20:21.416
I didn't like the way we left things
between us the other day, you know?

20:21.916 --> 20:24.958
I mean, for real, though, you know,
us brothers gotta stick together.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.250
You know what I mean?

20:26.250 --> 20:29.291
Uh-huh. And you thought you'd
demonstrate that by breaking and entering?

20:30.083 --> 20:33.500
I wanted to share
my favorite liquid lunch with you.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.833
Pappy Van Winkle.

20:36.458 --> 20:39.708
Twenty-three years
of distilled perfection.

20:39.958 --> 20:42.916
I figured we could settle our beef
like, you know, proper gentlemen.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.416
Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm!

20:47.916 --> 20:50.666
Pappy! You done outdid yourself
on this one.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.041
This the real thing?

20:53.541 --> 20:57.791
$5,000 worth of 24 carat liquid gold.

20:58.750 --> 21:03.541
- Should I be worried about poison?
- Poison? No! Nanotechs.

21:04.791 --> 21:06.083
Nanotech.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.083
Maybe I should pour this out,
make myself a fresh one.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.458
You do whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.958
But let me tell you,

21:13.958 --> 21:18.250
if you waste one drop
of this Family Reserve,

21:18.958 --> 21:22.958
I guarantee you, your ancestors
will reach out from the beyond

21:22.958 --> 21:25.291
and strangle your Black ass.

21:29.958 --> 21:30.958
Mmm.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.416
Okay.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.916
You wanna tell me
the real reason you're here?

21:35.458 --> 21:37.083
Can't get nothing by you. Huh?

21:39.458 --> 21:42.666
Aside from really wanting to squash
this beef between us...

21:42.958 --> 21:44.875
- I stopped by...
- You broke in.

21:46.541 --> 21:49.083
Broke in, to tell you...

21:54.041 --> 21:58.416
There are Skrulls
inside the U.S. government.

21:59.416 --> 22:00.666
This again?

22:01.291 --> 22:03.791
Skrulls in my security detail,
in the U.S. government,

22:03.791 --> 22:05.333
there are Skrulls everywhere?

22:05.333 --> 22:07.708
- I have it on excellent authority...
- Mmm-hmm.

22:07.708 --> 22:12.625
...that there is a Skrull mole
very close to the President.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.958
Wow. Really? How close?

22:16.375 --> 22:18.916
As close as you and I are
right now, uh, closer.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.291
- That's a wild story.
- Ain't it now?

22:27.625 --> 22:29.125
But here's the kicker.

22:30.583 --> 22:34.750
All you got to do
to keep my mouth shut about all this,

22:36.125 --> 22:37.500
give me my job back.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.041
You mind if I make a counter?

22:42.875 --> 22:43.916
Mmm!

22:57.125 --> 22:58.375
You see this all right?

23:00.541 --> 23:02.791
Oof! That's bad.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.416
And that's you.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.875
You and I both know

23:07.291 --> 23:08.541
that's Gravik.

23:10.291 --> 23:11.583
Come on.

23:11.708 --> 23:14.416
Is that really what you're gonna go with
at your trial?

23:14.416 --> 23:15.583
The alien defense?

23:15.583 --> 23:17.083
"No, Your Honor. That's not me.

23:17.083 --> 23:21.750
"That's a six-foot tall, bald, Black,
one-eyed extraterrestrial."

23:22.416 --> 23:24.208
Good luck with that.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.666
Look, I don't want you to worry, okay?

23:26.666 --> 23:29.083
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to protect you,

23:29.208 --> 23:32.583
to keep this video, and you know
all the copies that I made under wraps.

23:33.041 --> 23:35.333
But I can't have you running around

23:35.333 --> 23:36.750
spouting wild conspiracies,

23:36.750 --> 23:39.083
and I certainly can't have you

23:39.083 --> 23:42.291
breaking into my hotel suite,
threatening me.

23:42.541 --> 23:44.791
But what I can have
is the rest of this Pappy,

23:44.791 --> 23:47.208
'cause, baby, this is fire.

23:47.833 --> 23:50.291
Now, why don't you hobble
your ancient ass on out of here

23:50.291 --> 23:52.125
before I have you defenestrated?

24:08.750 --> 24:12.000
Liquid location tracker.

24:12.541 --> 24:13.875
It's not a bad idea.

24:43.375 --> 24:45.583
- Welcome to England, Mr. President.
- Colonel Rhodes.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.000
Hope you had a restful flight.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.208
Most important negotiation
since the Cuban Missile Crisis,

24:50.208 --> 24:51.750
yeah, I slept like a baby.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.875
Point taken, sir.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.500
There's a full briefing book for you
inside Stagecoach.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.958
One word if I may.

24:58.291 --> 25:01.916
The key thing about the Russians
is you have to project strength.

25:02.583 --> 25:04.083
There's an old Lenin quote,

25:04.500 --> 25:05.791
Vladimir, not John.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.541
"When you find flesh, you push.

25:09.791 --> 25:12.208
"When you find steel, you stop."

25:12.875 --> 25:14.333
You gotta be steel, sir.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.041
Colonel, can I ask you something?

25:18.291 --> 25:19.541
Absolutely anything, sir.

25:20.708 --> 25:24.625
Did you pre-game
for our bilateral with the Russians

25:24.625 --> 25:26.333
with a half-bottle of bourbon?

25:28.166 --> 25:30.375
I'm not sure
I understand the question, sir.

25:32.875 --> 25:34.666
Let's make sure the Colonel here

25:35.583 --> 25:37.416
has a large coffee for the road.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.916
Hmm.

25:45.833 --> 25:47.000
Get me a mint.

25:47.291 --> 25:48.291
Yes, sir.

25:49.541 --> 25:50.666
Get the door.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.416
Giddy up.

26:22.833 --> 26:27.000
We're in transit to the summit.
Citadel is in position number four.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.000
Two o'clock!
Incoming!

27:07.250 --> 27:08.250
Fire! Fire! Fire!

27:10.083 --> 27:11.125
Go ahead and fire!

27:11.125 --> 27:13.041
Confirm, Citadel is alive.

27:17.375 --> 27:19.750
<i>I repeat, Citadel is alive.</i>
This way!

27:21.958 --> 27:24.041
Enemy in sight!
Taking heavy fire.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.708
No question,
it's the Russians!

27:35.708 --> 27:37.833
Watch your six.
Cover!

27:54.958 --> 27:56.666
The Russians are advancing!

27:56.666 --> 27:57.875
Get down!

28:09.000 --> 28:10.583
Go! Ten o'clock.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.458
Watch the chopper!

28:12.458 --> 28:14.833
Two and twelve.
Two and twelve. Advance.

28:17.416 --> 28:19.083
Bloody hell, Fury. It's a kill zone.

28:19.083 --> 28:22.041
Whole planet will be a kill zone
if we don't save Ritson.

28:25.625 --> 28:27.583
Fire! Fire! Fire!

28:53.958 --> 28:55.375
Defend Citadel!

28:55.500 --> 28:56.708
Move!

28:56.708 --> 28:58.250
Fury inbound.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.458
Ten o'clock!

29:06.000 --> 29:07.416
Fury's here.

29:10.708 --> 29:11.916
Cover the Stagecoach!

29:11.916 --> 29:13.083
Take this mag!

29:14.375 --> 29:15.375
South side!

29:15.666 --> 29:16.666
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

29:27.166 --> 29:28.416
Fury. Fury's here.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.666
- Reinforcements here, sir.
- Fury.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.416
- Cover up!
- More men coming, sir!

29:37.416 --> 29:39.125
Move! Move! Move!

29:39.708 --> 29:42.000
Get to the president's car.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.875
Go, go, go!
Hold the line.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.208
<i>Requesting backup.
Repeat, requesting backup.</i>

29:48.208 --> 29:49.333
Let's go!

29:49.333 --> 29:50.500
Sniper!

29:51.250 --> 29:52.750
Mr. President? Sir?

29:53.541 --> 29:55.500
- He's out.
- I've got this. Stand back, man.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.375
Reinforcements now!

30:04.375 --> 30:06.583
Take care of Talos. Now!

30:28.166 --> 30:29.833
The Russians are still coming!

30:29.833 --> 30:31.541
Russians, two o'clock!

30:33.166 --> 30:34.583
They're still advancing!

30:43.291 --> 30:45.583
He's a bloody alien.
He's trying to get to Ritson!

30:45.583 --> 30:48.250
No, no, no! Hold your fire! He's with me.

30:48.750 --> 30:51.166
- He's with us.
Where are those helos?

31:01.083 --> 31:04.416
<i>Alpha, Bravo, Tango,
get those choppers in here, now!</i>

31:08.208 --> 31:09.875
Reclaim your positions.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.416
Where are they?

31:20.333 --> 31:22.666
President's
out of the vehicle!

31:24.000 --> 31:25.333
Cover the President!

31:26.708 --> 31:29.083
Talos, hang in there.
I'll be back for you.

31:33.750 --> 31:35.916
- Put him in my car.
- I got my own ride.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.583
Come on, I've got you.

31:42.708 --> 31:43.750
I got you.

31:44.708 --> 31:47.041
Come on. I got you.

31:52.500 --> 31:53.666
Fire!

31:53.666 --> 31:54.958
I'm hit.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.375
Put him down.

32:01.333 --> 32:05.875
I said put him down, now!

32:18.208 --> 32:19.750
No!

32:27.041 --> 32:28.750
Reinforcements are here!

32:28.750 --> 32:30.458
Here they come, lads!
