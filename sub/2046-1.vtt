<i>Hey, pass the bottle over.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:43.522
<i>- A little busy back here. Okay?
- Yeah, we can see that, David.</i>

00:43.680 --> 00:45.205
<i>Yeah, you can get un-busy.</i>

00:45.360 --> 00:48.569
<i>Oh, come on, Marce. I mean,
you know, we skipped graduation for this.</i>

00:48.760 --> 00:50.922
<i>You are not graduating down there,
David Brody.</i>

00:51.080 --> 00:52.730
<i>Hey, you better not be filming us.</i>

00:52.880 --> 00:54.325
<i>No, just checking messages.</i>

00:54.480 --> 00:57.563
<i>Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head</i>

00:58.920 --> 01:00.649
What was that?

01:02.840 --> 01:04.763
- Do you see that?
- What?

01:04.959 --> 01:07.645
Man. You guys seeing this?

01:09.760 --> 01:11.603
- Whoa. Hey, Billy.
- Whoa. Ho-ho-ho.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.330
Hang on.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.481
- We should go.
- I gotta get this. Hang on.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.043
- Can we go?
- Come on, let's go.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.725
- Yeah. Hold on.
- Get in!

01:23.880 --> 01:26.690
I will! Just give me one minute!

01:26.840 --> 01:28.968
- Come on!
- Are you seeing this?

01:29.120 --> 01:30.610
- Whoa!
- Billy, get in!

01:31.720 --> 01:33.609
Oh, shit! Tornado!

01:33.880 --> 01:35.689
Oh, my God!

01:35.840 --> 01:37.001
Get us out of here. Go!

02:09.240 --> 02:11.971
<i>The tornado
that struck Oklahoma last night...</i>

02:12.120 --> 02:14.043
<i>...took the lives
of four high school students...</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:17.044
<i>...when it picked up their car
and tossed it into the air.</i>

02:17.240 --> 02:21.006
<i>Tornadoes in this region of the Midwest
are common, but it only took a glance...</i>

02:21.200 --> 02:22.611
<i>...to know this was different.</i>

02:22.760 --> 02:25.286
<i>Not so much a twisting column
but a behemoth.</i>

02:25.440 --> 02:27.761
Great. We missed another one.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.322
Hey, you guys know
the goal of a documentary...

02:31.480 --> 02:33.369
...is to actually document
something, right?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.885
Copy <i>that.</i>

02:35.120 --> 02:36.281
We need a tornado.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.731
That's it. We need a tornado. Yeah.
When was the last time we shot one, Lucas?

02:42.200 --> 02:44.680
That EF4 that we shot a year ago.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.969
Right. A year ago. So we're 0 for 365.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.090
Let's figure that average.
Hey, Jacob, you play baseball. Right?

02:51.240 --> 02:54.528
- Hockey, actually.
- Yeah? I played lacrosse.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.366
- Really? No way.
- This is fun. It's like a family road trip.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.922
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, Jacob.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.969
You missed everything.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.369
No. Except we do have 200 hours
of cloud sunsets...

03:06.520 --> 03:10.081
...and us going to every drive-through
from Idaho to Texas.

03:10.280 --> 03:14.126
Which makes this the most expensive
home movie ever.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.889
Just to be clear...

03:18.280 --> 03:21.090
...we're gonna get paid
whether we see a tornado or not, right?

03:23.640 --> 03:24.721
Right?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.448
<i>Where do you wanna go, boss?</i>

03:29.040 --> 03:31.930
I have no idea, Daryl.
My job is to shoot them...

03:32.120 --> 03:33.281
...not find <i>them.</i>

03:33.480 --> 03:35.608
- He's upset.
- What else is new?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.491
Three months of that broken record.
I'm over it.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.768
Just be thankful we're in here
and not in the <i>Titus.</i>

03:40.960 --> 03:43.964
- Must be brutal in there.
- You left <i>the</i> radio on, genius.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.003
Shit.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.484
That probably didn't help his mood.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.722
Screw his mood.
We've got other problems.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.326
There's no way we could have known
that tornado was gonna hit.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.007
The National Weather
Service has issued a <i>tornado watch...</i>

03:58.160 --> 04:00.925
<i>...throughout Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri.</i>

04:01.080 --> 04:04.243
Pete. National Weather posted
a tornado watch across five states.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.925
Front's growing and moving fast.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.163
I think this thing's gonna hit
about 200 miles north of here.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.526
<i>Then we better haul ass.</i>

04:10.680 --> 04:14.844
<i>If you're in the path of this storm,
you could be in for</i> a <i>very long day.</i>

04:15.400 --> 04:19.529
Hey. So today is June 16th...

04:19.680 --> 04:24.004
...and this is my time capsule message
to the future me.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.649
Um... This is gonna be recorded
and stored for 25 years...

04:28.800 --> 04:32.691
...when you, the 41-year-old
Donnie Fuller, will...

04:34.120 --> 04:37.920
...I don't know,
see how life's panned out, I guess.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.206
Uh...

04:39.800 --> 04:42.007
By now Dad is 65.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.889
So Mom would have been...

04:44.800 --> 04:46.802
Mom would have been 63.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.450
Um...

04:49.440 --> 04:51.886
What else?
You're a junior at Silverton High School.

04:52.040 --> 04:56.011
You're head of the Video Club,
which is awesome.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.045
And...

05:00.440 --> 05:02.886
And that's pretty much it.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.247
So this is Casa de Donnie...

05:05.400 --> 05:06.731
Where you spend most your time...

05:06.880 --> 05:10.566
...staring at the photo
of Kaitlyn Johnston and doing nothing.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.566
This is Trey, your annoying
brother. - Respect to you too.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.371
By the time you see this,
Trey's gonna be in the state pen.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.526
Heh. No way. I will be playing lead guitar
to 100,000 fans in Madison Square Garden.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.844
But you will be stuck right here,
moaning over her.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.890
This is Dad. He's the vice
principal at Silverton High School...

05:32.040 --> 05:34.771
...which is not the greatest for me.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.127
- Uh, Dad?
- Hmm?

05:37.280 --> 05:40.250
Hey, come on. I'm having breakfast here.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.170
- Trey, I am leaving in five, ready or not.
- Relax!

05:44.360 --> 05:46.362
Wanna say something
to the future you, Dad?

05:46.520 --> 05:49.808
Not now, Donnie, okay?
Busy day. Can't you see that?

05:49.960 --> 05:51.166
Dad, you're the one...

05:51.320 --> 05:53.971
...that wanted these video-time-capsule
pieces in the first place.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.448
This weather's gonna kill the graduation
ceremony.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.965
We should postpone it.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.408
Okay. This is time-capsule interview,
version number two.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.362
What kind of man am I?
That's a hard question to answer.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.807
I mean, how do you describe perfection?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.883
I thought you did your interview already.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.121
I did. Yesterday.

06:13.280 --> 06:16.124
But then I remembered I look way better
in the morning light.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.126
Lift with your legs, Dad.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.930
Come on, guys, I could use some help.

06:21.080 --> 06:25.404
Ah, man, I can't.
That old soccer-injury thing with my back.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.324
- Yeah? You get all that?
- I did.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.641
Good. Get in.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.881
Shotgun!

06:30.520 --> 06:32.363
- Donnie, let's go.
- I'm taking my bike.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.490
Dude. Chill. If you
want shotgun, just take it.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.281
Hey, I'm sorry. With the storm and
graduation today, I got a lot on my plate.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.365
- I know. It's always something. I'm used to it.
- What does that mean?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.841
It means you're either ignoring me
or on my case.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.240
- That's not true.
- If it's not my room, it's my grades.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.483
Or it's this time capsule,
which I'm working my ass off to get done.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.401
No. What's the point?
Nothing's ever good enough for you.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.125
Stop for second. Let's talk.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.044
No. Busy day, Dad. Can't you see that?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.525
All right, Dad. Dad.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.765
Right at this moment... Don't even think about
it before you answer. Just blurt it out.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.160
...Who is your favorite son?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.646
Get in the car.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.526
Well.

07:14.280 --> 07:17.682
I know we missed it last night.
We couldn't get there in time.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.650
Yeah. I know. I know.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.763
Well, if you pull my
funding, that's it for me.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.008
And we're onto a big one.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.204
I don't know how big. It's a tornado.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.840
They don't call to tell me
how big they're gonna be.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.446
There's a massive storm front moving
through the area.

07:34.640 --> 07:37.371
We're gonna get it.
We just don't have it yet.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.689
Uh, well, she was your idea.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.202
I wanted David Sinclair, remember?

07:42.360 --> 07:45.569
Yeah. Well, I was getting a lot closer
without Allison and her data.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.651
It's an instinct game.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.609
And she ain't got it.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.408
Hey, Jacob. A little help?

07:53.560 --> 07:56.609
- I can't. If I stop filming,
Pete's gonna fire me. DARYL: Dude.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.444
Don't you dare let him bully you.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.570
Easy for you to say.
You're not the one sitting next to him.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.846
You having fun yet?

08:03.040 --> 08:05.646
Oh, yeah, dude.
This is so much better than CancÃºn.

08:05.800 --> 08:07.928
I'm telling you,
last year we got within 100 yards.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.163
It's like nothing you've seen before.
Trust me.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.482
Okay, so larger system is moving
toward Riverside as predicted.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.886
I think we should go here.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.086
The wind and precipitation readings in the
trailing cell look better for a funnel.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.641
Exactly what you said
about Morristown and Osgood.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.327
This one's different. It's not following
the pattern. It's growing faster.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.527
It's growing faster.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.889
Every storm chaser
this side of Hawaii is going to Riverside.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.770
Which, by the way,
is where I think we should go.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.928
But you want us to go where? Silverton?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.841
If you would like, consider this
an instinct thing instead of a data thing.

08:44.039 --> 08:47.726
If you heard that,
then you also heard that Steve cut us off.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.002
- And it's on my dime now.
- I heard that.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.288
This is months on the road.
And guess what.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.603
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.
Worst season I've ever had.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.201
You think this is instinct.
I think it's data.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.330
The fact is, it's neither
without a big fat dose of luck.

09:01.480 --> 09:05.724
And there is nothing I can do about that.
Okay?

09:06.200 --> 09:07.486
So back off of me.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.371
I just want you and your data
to find me a goddamn tornado.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.887
Then Silverton's our best chance.

09:18.920 --> 09:19.967
What do you think?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.249
She's the one with all the degrees.

09:23.640 --> 09:24.846
My money's on her.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.210
Silverton it is.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.530
You better be right about this.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.047
- It's your last chance.
- Wow.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.727
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.325
All right. We recording?

09:41.480 --> 09:42.561
- We're good?
- You ready?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.840
- Hell, yeah, man!
- Yeah! Get fired up!

09:44.960 --> 09:47.440
- I'm ready!
- You ready for this shit?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.040
Maybe we should get some girls
to watch this stunt, huh?

09:50.160 --> 09:53.881
That's what I'm talking about. Get
fired up! Let's go for real! It's go time!

09:54.040 --> 09:56.008
- Let's go, let's go!
- Safety first.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.970
Okay, just do a test run first, all right?
Move, jackass!

09:59.160 --> 10:02.482
- Get out of the way. Here we go.
- Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.640
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!

10:07.760 --> 10:09.683
He's gonna check the speed on this one.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.851
Yeah! Do it, bro!

10:14.000 --> 10:15.764
- Let's go!
- Test drive!

10:15.920 --> 10:17.490
Let's go for the test drive!

10:20.760 --> 10:22.125
There you go, Donkie!

10:22.280 --> 10:24.886
Well, that looked pretty good to me.
What do you think?

10:25.040 --> 10:26.166
Eh.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.482
What? You wanna
nail some tail or what, dog?

10:28.640 --> 10:31.689
- I'm always up for nailing tail!
- That's what I'm talking about.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.605
Once this hits the Internet, you'll
be beating them off with a stick.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.889
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?
- I'm talking fives, sixes.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.451
Fives, for sure. Come on!

10:39.600 --> 10:40.760
- Barn!
- Trust me, buddy!

10:44.000 --> 10:45.889
Yeah! All right! Hang on.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.765
- Richie! Record this, son.
- Are you drunk?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.800
- Yeah.
- I'm just getting started.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.247
Hang on! Wait!
We're gonna light the pool on fire.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.520
- Light that thing, Richie!
- Yeah! Light it up!

10:55.600 --> 10:56.886
Light that puppy up.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.087
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

10:58.240 --> 11:00.322
The Flaming Pool of Death!

11:00.800 --> 11:01.847
You ready to go?

11:02.320 --> 11:03.367
Let's do this!

11:03.520 --> 11:04.601
Action!

11:04.760 --> 11:06.762
That's right! Come on, Donk!
You got this!

11:09.000 --> 11:10.206
Oopsie daisy!

11:15.760 --> 11:17.649
- That was awesome. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.406
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That was awesome, Donk.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.325
- A million hits, easy!
- Oh! A million?

11:23.720 --> 11:27.042
- Maybe more!
- Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!

11:28.840 --> 11:30.842
- Shit, my pool!
- Dude, your mom. Your mom.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.567
What the hell are you two idiots doing?

11:34.720 --> 11:37.405
- I thought you were at work!
- That makes any difference?

11:37.560 --> 11:38.607
Look!

11:38.800 --> 11:41.804
- That's the Titus! I've seen it on TV! Come on!
- Bye, Ma!

11:55.480 --> 11:58.723
Let's take a tour of the ultimate
storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.363
She's equipped with 24 surveillance
cameras, so we have eyes from every angle.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.602
Bulletproof Lexan windows.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.441
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.807
A five-ton winch.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.561
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.281
Now, back here, we have
a mini weather center, complete with...

12:18.440 --> 12:22.206
...an anemometer, humidity sensor
and potentiometer.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.528
But the thing that makes her really special
are these grappling claws.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.923
Ah.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.721
They can stabilize us in winds
up to 170 miles an hour.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.089
We're not going anywhere
with those suckers dug in.

12:39.480 --> 12:40.970
Clear!

12:54.080 --> 12:56.731
This is the culmination of my life's work.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.290
What about the turret, Pete?

12:59.440 --> 13:02.205
Right. The turret is up here.

13:06.080 --> 13:10.881
Which gives us a 360-degree view
of outside.

13:11.960 --> 13:16.124
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that
will, when we find one of these bad boys...

13:16.280 --> 13:18.203
...give us the shot of the century.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.051
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:

13:21.680 --> 13:24.251
the eye of the tornado.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.201
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.

13:32.360 --> 13:33.725
Let's get some B roll.

13:33.880 --> 13:38.408
Get shots of the claws, the instruments
on the back, panel stuff.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.688
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?
- Got it.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.689
My storm's expanding.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.126
That means it's going to be really big
by the time it gets here.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.004
<i>Hey-</i>

13:53.200 --> 13:55.043
How's my bug?

13:56.840 --> 13:58.842
Well, listen, um...

13:59.200 --> 14:02.044
I know I was gonna try
and make it home this weekend...

14:02.200 --> 14:05.602
...but we got a real big storm coming,
and Mama's gotta work.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.604
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell Grandma
and Grandpa that we're...

14:13.200 --> 14:14.804
I know.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.440
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.970
I'm really sorry.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.360
Gracie...

14:22.080 --> 14:23.241
Grace...

14:24.120 --> 14:26.282
Hey, hey-

14:32.040 --> 14:33.201
Did you get all that?

14:33.840 --> 14:37.686
We can't postpone this, Gary. There's
not enough room inside for everyone.

14:37.840 --> 14:41.162
- The weather's gonna be fine.
- It's your call.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.210
There's Dad taking shit
from Principal Walker.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.640
I Will do that.

14:46.120 --> 14:48.043
Did you get the last of the interviews?

14:48.240 --> 14:49.287
I still got a few to do.

14:49.440 --> 14:53.809
But what I did get was a nice shot
of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.007
Trey.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.124
What? You don't get many teachers
with a rack like that.

14:58.280 --> 15:01.090
Cut it out. We need to start editing
right after graduation.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.561
Dad wants the clips online
by the end of next week.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.041
What's the point of doing
a video time capsule?

15:06.200 --> 15:08.567
Video won't even exist in 25 years.

15:08.760 --> 15:11.445
What? Let's just get it finished. Okay?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.681
Fine.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.323
Did you see the weather report?
Supposed to be a big storm coming.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.005
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...

15:18.160 --> 15:19.764
Whoa. There's your girl.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.163
If I don't get it by the end of the day,
you'll not get the internship.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.560
It's as simple as that.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.770
Oh, dude. Now's your chance, man.
Vulnerable girl.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.924
Comforting guy. Right?
Just go talk to her and see if she's okay.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.401
- We have work to do.
- Chickenshit. Come on.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.246
I need to get the last of the interviews,
and Dad's, like, on my case about it.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.405
Screw Dad.
Go do something for yourself for once.

15:42.560 --> 15:46.565
Bro, I am literally begging you.
Just go talk to her.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.081
All right?

15:49.360 --> 15:50.441
All right.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.931
Yeah?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.686
- Stop.
- Heh.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.524
Have fun.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.044
He's really doing it.
I gotta film this train wreck.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.041
And he's pulling into the station.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.850
Hey, Kaitlyn?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.931
<i>Hey-</i>

16:08.080 --> 16:09.445
It's Donnie.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.045
Yeah. I know.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.004
Strike one.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.727
Are you okay?
I saw you outside with Miss Blasky.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.928
Right. Uh...

16:20.360 --> 16:24.968
I had this application for an apprenticeship,
and it had to be submitted by the weekend.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.569
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,
and it's just completely corrupted.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.961
I don't know what happened to it.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.482
It was fine yesterday.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.126
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast.
What was it about?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.930
The abandoned factory on Garner.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.764
- Oh, the paper mill?
- Yeah.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.081
Yeah.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.528
When they shut it down, the state
never paid for an official cleanup.

16:48.680 --> 16:52.048
So there's all these chemicals
and hazardous materials sitting there...

16:52.280 --> 16:55.523
...contaminating the soil
and probably running off into the water.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.810
- That's what the film's about.
- Pretend to be interested.

16:58.960 --> 17:02.601
Anyway, the submission doesn't make
any sense at all without it.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.080
- So I'm screwed.
- Come on, man. Take a swing.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.001
- You're into all this environmental stuff,
huh? Come on, man. Just ask her out.

17:09.359 --> 17:12.329
Gotta take care of the planet, right?

17:12.480 --> 17:15.244
Or else the planet
will take care of us, right? Heh.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.731
That was awkward.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.487
Heh. Yeah. Well, some of us care,
or at least are trying to.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.808
No. I'm sorry.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.521
I can help. I have all these cameras
and this editing software and...

17:26.680 --> 17:28.170
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:28.319 --> 17:31.085
Well, this will be easy.
We can reshoot this.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.244
- It'd have to be today.
- Today?

17:35.280 --> 17:37.521
Oh, you're filming the graduation.
No, it's fine.

17:37.680 --> 17:40.604
No. No. My brother, Trey,
he's good with all this stuff too.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.245
- He can get that.
- No way.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.368
- Like, he can get that footage.
- Really?

17:44.520 --> 17:45.806
- It's not a problem.
- Sure?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.367
- Yes, it's a problem.
- I'm sure. Yeah.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.361
Thank you so much.

17:51.520 --> 17:56.321
No. You have no idea what this means
for me. I owe you so big for this.

17:56.480 --> 17:59.086
No. Well, you know,
me and the planet go way back, so...

18:01.040 --> 18:02.326
Thank you.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.683
<i>- I'll</i> see you later.
- Cool.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.205
- Thank you.
- Okay, no.

18:06.360 --> 18:08.328
This is so not cool.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.409
You are kidding me.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.530
What are you doing?

18:15.760 --> 18:16.807
What are you doing?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.530
You're gonna skip the ceremony?

18:18.680 --> 18:20.284
Yeah. Yeah.

18:20.440 --> 18:23.967
You said do something for yourself,
so I'm doing something for myself.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.640
Yeah. And leaving me to do all the filming?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.208
You can handle it. Right?

18:30.280 --> 18:32.282
You can handle it, right?

18:32.760 --> 18:34.125
- Yes.
- Heh.

18:34.280 --> 18:37.363
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
Hey. You go for it, bro.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.171
But get some skin on camera.
E-mail it to me.

18:40.360 --> 18:44.490
- Just get the interviews, all right?
- All right, all right, I'm going.

18:44.680 --> 18:45.727
Okay.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.481
Yo, Todd. We're rolling.

18:51.520 --> 18:54.410
Yo, what's up, me?
How's life in the future, bro?

18:54.560 --> 18:59.407
So I just know by now you are playing
for the NBA, you're super loaded...

18:59.560 --> 19:03.326
...and you got a super-smoking-hot
cheerleader wife.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.687
So why the hell are you watching this
right now?

19:05.880 --> 19:08.724
Why don't you get up to your penthouse
and bang her good, right?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.641
That's your time-capsule message, Todd?

19:12.800 --> 19:13.881
Why not?

19:14.040 --> 19:15.690
A message?

19:15.880 --> 19:20.568
Too late for me. Too late for these guys.
But my kids? Grandkids? Simple.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.250
Study. Get good grades.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.325
Or else you're gonna hang around this group
of losers shoveling shit all day. Sorry.

19:26.480 --> 19:29.609
Please marry a rich guy.
Please marry a rich guy.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.762
Uh, we're rolling.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.484
So, what would you like to say
to yourself in 25 years?

19:36.360 --> 19:37.441
That was it.

19:37.600 --> 19:43.050
Twenty-five years' time? Ha! My guess is
we'd have blown up the world by that time.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.287
All right.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.568
High school sucked.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.883
Hopefully, it was all worth it.
You've got your Ph.D. from Brown.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.731
You're doing research
and using your skills to help...

19:52.920 --> 19:54.410
Douche-rocket! Ha!

19:56.480 --> 19:57.845
Sorry, man.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.360
- Radio check.
- Yes, sir.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.084
Copy <i>that.</i>

20:01.240 --> 20:02.571
Camera's good.

20:02.800 --> 20:07.010
Hey, guys. So you think we'll get to see
a tornado today or what?

20:07.160 --> 20:08.446
You never know.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.247
Jacob, did you bring
all the camera batteries? I only saw four.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.281
I, uh, left them back
at the hotel on charge.

20:16.480 --> 20:19.529
Today is not a good day to run out
of power. We gotta go get them.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.200
Let's get moving. This system's
supposed to hit within the hour.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.646
If that.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.122
Come on, dude, get your shit together, man.
You're making me look bad.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.290
Mike check. One, two, three.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.840
- Where's Donnie?
- Mike check.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.691
- Yeah, it's good.
- I don't know. Around.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.647
- He knows what time we're starting?
- Yeah, sure.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.649
Anyway, I can run the cameras.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.205
All three?

20:45.400 --> 20:48.449
Well, yes, Dad.
That's why they invented tripods.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.846
Trey, this is important.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.884
And I can't do it, right?

20:54.040 --> 20:56.168
I didn't say that.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.449
You kind of did.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.165
Hey, Mom. How's Gracie? She still mad?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.527
<i>She's 5 years old. She'll be fine.</i>

21:09.680 --> 21:13.366
I know, but I've been gone for months.
That's too long to be away from her.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.442
I keep thinking it was
a mistake coming here.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.125
<i>Allison, we're fine.</i>

21:18.560 --> 21:20.927
<i>This is your job.
What you're doing is important.</i>

21:21.080 --> 21:23.128
I can't stop thinking
about those kids that died.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.520
What <i>kids?</i>

21:24.720 --> 21:27.724
Nothing, sweetie. Grandma
and Mama were just talking. But listen.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.407
I am sorry about our call earlier, okay?
I don't want you mad at me.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.250
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

21:33.400 --> 21:35.562
Real soon. The season's almost over.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.449
<i>Why can't you just come now?</i>

21:37.600 --> 21:40.285
I wish I could. I really do. I miss you.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.760
Allison!

21:42.400 --> 21:45.768
Listen, I gotta go. But I'm gonna check in
every couple hours, okay?

21:45.920 --> 21:47.809
<i>Promise me you'll be home soon?</i>

21:48.000 --> 21:49.047
I promise.

21:49.240 --> 21:50.730
Allison!

21:51.080 --> 21:52.491
I gotta go. I love you, bug.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.244
<i>I love you too.</i>

21:54.400 --> 21:55.447
I'm coming, boss!

21:55.600 --> 21:58.251
<i>We have now confirmed
that a tornado has hit Riverside.</i>

21:58.400 --> 22:01.927
<i>All of Shaw County remains
under a severe thunderstorm warning.</i>

22:02.080 --> 22:03.605
<i>Chuck, what do you see on radar?</i>

22:03.800 --> 22:06.167
<i>What we're watching now
is this very</i> rapid...

22:06.320 --> 22:07.765
- Data, huh?
- Shit.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.241
Maybe we'll catch the tail end of it.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.525
- What's going on in Silverton?
- Give me a minute.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.449
Um, it's dissipating. There's some scattered
thunderstorms and that's about it.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.285
Thunderstorms? Thunderstorms.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.322
Put everything in the van.
We're moving now.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.801
- Where do you wanna go?
- Uh...

22:30.960 --> 22:33.770
You're not going anywhere.
We are going to Riverside.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.800
- How about...?
- We'll catch the next one.

22:35.920 --> 22:39.481
Look. There's not gonna be a next one.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.130
Let's go.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.365
Look at the size of them!

22:58.600 --> 23:00.841
- I thought you said it was dissipating.
- It was.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.128
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna check the Doppler!

23:03.280 --> 23:04.850
Right behind you, Allison.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.371
Whoa, wait! Wait up!

23:07.520 --> 23:09.488
Oh, you see these, Allison? These are huge!

23:09.640 --> 23:10.801
Yeah!

23:16.640 --> 23:19.325
Ow! Son of a bitch!

23:19.720 --> 23:23.406
Oh, my God! Look at these, guys!
They're bigger than golf balls!

23:24.160 --> 23:26.640
Ah! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

23:32.760 --> 23:34.842
- What do we got?
- It's regenerating.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.047
And?

23:36.240 --> 23:37.685
Silverton.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.921
It's coming.

23:39.120 --> 23:40.246
Great.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.524
Great.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.001
To all the students
of this year's graduating class...

23:45.160 --> 23:50.087
...who have dedicated themselves to the
hard work necessary to reach this day...

23:50.280 --> 23:53.523
...you are now standing on the threshold
of adult life.

23:54.920 --> 23:56.684
You are free to take your own path...

23:57.320 --> 24:00.051
...and that path will be
different for all of you.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.363
But it's now time to create your own lives.

24:03.520 --> 24:06.205
To create your own destiny.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.362
I mean, look at this place.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.046
They should tear it down. Decontaminate it.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.362
Plant some trees or a garden or something.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.364
They should totally
build a skate park here.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.564
No, a garden. Definitely a garden.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.801
Yeah.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.406
So you wanna just
put the tripod down over there?

24:32.880 --> 24:34.291
- Wow.
- Hmm.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.966
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.286
I look okay?

24:43.440 --> 24:46.489
Yeah. You look beautiful.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.329
I wasn't saying... I was, like, for the...

24:51.960 --> 24:53.928
I don't know. Uh, I'm rolling here.

24:54.080 --> 24:58.005
- So whenever you're ready to...
- Thanks, Donnie. You're really sweet.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.926
Right.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.884
<i>Pete,</i> where are you?

25:03.040 --> 25:04.724
I'm coming right up.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.369
- Got wall cloud to the east.
- Whoa.

25:13.520 --> 25:14.931
Yeah, but no vortex.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.607
- Jacob. I got some circulation over here.
- Over here, got it.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.410
It's heading towards those trees.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.085
I'm on Oakwood Road.

25:22.240 --> 25:25.130
<i>If you're in Shaw County, you need
to get yourself to a safe place now.</i>

25:25.280 --> 25:28.011
<i>This thing is going to track right,
almost towards town.</i>

25:28.160 --> 25:30.288
<i>There it is now.
You can see the wall cloud.</i>

25:30.440 --> 25:32.522
<i>It's lower as it transitions to the east.</i>

25:33.000 --> 25:36.721
- Just south. Right behind the base.
- Wow. Look at that.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.325
Come on, baby.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.642
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.402
What are those idiots doing?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.090
- Aw, this is a beauty!
- Whoo!

25:47.240 --> 25:49.527
Yeah! Twista Hunterz, baby!

25:49.680 --> 25:51.409
Get in the field! Get in the field!

25:53.160 --> 25:54.446
Look at that funnel.

25:54.600 --> 25:58.491
We got a vortex. Come on.
Here we go, guys. Here we go.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.810
There's debris.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.644
- Jake, you getting this?
- Oh, yeah.

26:02.800 --> 26:03.847
<i>There it is.</i>

26:04.040 --> 26:06.850
<i>This tornado just touched down.
We can see it from here.</i>

26:07.040 --> 26:09.805
<i>It's ripping up trees.
It's ripping up everything in sight.</i>

26:10.000 --> 26:13.925
<i>If you're above ground, you need to get to
a storm shelter or a safe place right now.</i>

26:14.400 --> 26:16.562
I leave you with John Updike's words:

26:17.080 --> 26:20.482
"You cannot help but learn more
as you take the world into your hands.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.806
Take it up reverently...

26:22.320 --> 26:26.530
...for it is an old piece of clay,
with millions of thumbprints on it."

26:27.160 --> 26:28.844
Oh, great.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.684
I guess we should, uh...

26:30.840 --> 26:33.081
I guess we should start finishing up, then.

26:33.560 --> 26:35.528
Whoo! Look at the size of that sucker!

26:35.680 --> 26:37.091
Look how fast it's spinning, man!

26:38.480 --> 26:39.686
Shit! Man, that was close!

26:39.840 --> 26:41.524
Dude. My arm hairs.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.603
No. Dude, it's your "hairs" hairs!

26:43.760 --> 26:46.809
- They're standing up on your head, bro!
- Ha-ha-ha.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.210
Come on. Come on.

26:49.360 --> 26:52.569
- That's the vorticity stretching.
- We're on, we're on. Let's move!

26:52.720 --> 26:54.802
- I wanna report a tornado on the ground.
- Let's go.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.406
There's no damage yet,
but it's in a semi-residential area.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.531
About 15 miles to the north of Silverton,
Oklahoma.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.324
Seniors! Stand up!

27:04.040 --> 27:05.690
Stand up!

27:06.360 --> 27:08.044
We salute you!

27:10.280 --> 27:11.691
All right! Ah.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.086
Go inside, guys.

27:15.240 --> 27:18.847
- Stay calm! Move inside in an orderly
fashion! Everybody, back inside.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.889
- To the main building.
- Dude, come on.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.804
Quickly as you can.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.887
Shit!

27:30.120 --> 27:31.645
Here we go! Quickly! Come on!

27:31.840 --> 27:33.763
Here we go! Come on, this way.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.449
<i>Pete,</i> give <i>me</i> an update.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.921
I'm gonna find the intercept
near Grant and Malcolm.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.163
<i>- Approach it from the east.
Jake, you're out of focus. Tighten up.</i>

27:45.320 --> 27:47.971
<i>You need to position yourself.
This thing is moving fast.</i>

27:48.120 --> 27:49.645
I need a clear path.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.770
I got a field coming up on your right
that should have access.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.960
<i>Give me a second to
calculate rotation speed.</i>

27:55.080 --> 27:56.844
Make it fast.

27:57.840 --> 27:59.729
<i>- Wind speed is 140.
- Direction?</i>

27:59.880 --> 28:00.927
Southeast.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.607
- Lucas, we good?
- Yeah. We good. We good.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.285
You getting this, Jacob?

28:06.440 --> 28:07.646
Oh, yeah. Sure.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.771
Okay. Ready for intercept.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.126
Daryl, pull over.

28:20.040 --> 28:22.281
- Get out there, dog! Get out there!
- Look at me!

28:22.440 --> 28:24.886
- I'm in a tornado! I'm in a tornado!
- Whoo!

28:26.960 --> 28:28.803
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!

28:38.960 --> 28:40.724
We're in the path! We're in the path!

28:40.920 --> 28:42.968
Okay. Anchor down. How we looking?

28:43.560 --> 28:46.245
- It's heading right for you.
- Get ready, guys.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.482
Oh, shit.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.283
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

28:59.440 --> 29:02.887
Jacob! Don't you lose it on me, you hear?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.281
Hold on, boys!

29:06.720 --> 29:08.802
Shit! You guys, come on, now!

29:12.120 --> 29:14.009
This is crazy, you guys. This is nuts.

29:16.440 --> 29:18.442
Come on, come on! God!

29:23.360 --> 29:24.600
Shit, that thing is crazy!

29:25.000 --> 29:27.207
Hang on!

29:30.680 --> 29:32.728
It's coming right! Go! Go on!

29:45.080 --> 29:46.366
Damn it!

29:46.520 --> 29:48.249
<i>It dodged to our left.</i>

29:49.280 --> 29:50.441
Oh, shit.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.085
It's headed for the school.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.609
Everybody! Okay, go!

29:54.800 --> 29:57.804
Here we go. Here we go. Keep moving.
All the way down the hall.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.128
Keep this door open. Come on.

30:00.720 --> 30:03.405
- Move on in, folks. Move in.
- Come on.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.721
Jesus.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.961
Everybody into the storm shelter area.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.049
- Keep this hallway clear.
- Come on.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.720
- Make sure nobody's behind us.
- All the way down!

30:12.880 --> 30:14.166
Go on, all the way in.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.084
Trey! Where's Donnie?

30:16.240 --> 30:19.244
Uh, I don't exactly know.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.081
Get away from the window.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.126
Tornado!

30:30.280 --> 30:31.850
Get going! Run!

30:37.160 --> 30:39.447
Come on! Come on! Let's go! Go, go, go!

30:40.080 --> 30:41.127
It's okay!

30:41.280 --> 30:43.760
All the way down the hall! Keep going!

30:43.920 --> 30:46.844
All the way down! Keep moving.
Come on. Fast as you can!

30:47.880 --> 30:48.927
Okay, get down!

30:49.400 --> 30:50.606
Let's go. Come on.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.923
Face the wall! Cover your heads!
Stay down!

30:54.120 --> 30:56.361
Heads down, everybody!
Everyone stay down!

31:03.600 --> 31:04.886
Get your heads down!

31:06.440 --> 31:08.124
Get your head down.

31:17.880 --> 31:19.644
Stay against the wall!

31:27.080 --> 31:29.321
No, no! Oh, my God!

31:33.960 --> 31:35.166
Trey!

31:35.600 --> 31:36.681
Dad!

31:52.760 --> 31:53.841
Anybody hurt?

31:54.000 --> 31:55.684
We're all right.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.851
- Trey?
- Yeah. I'm good.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.167
You ready?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.331
Oh, hey, can you hold this? You got it?

32:12.880 --> 32:15.360
- My dad.
- Are you gonna answer it?

32:15.520 --> 32:18.205
No. You kidding me?
I missed the whole grad ceremony. No.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.044
Is he gonna be pissed at you?

32:20.200 --> 32:22.248
Nah. You know what?
Trey will have filmed it.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.289
Oh, come on, pick up.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.687
- Trey, give me your phone.
- Yeah.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.481
- Trey?
- Donnie, you okay?

32:38.680 --> 32:41.047
Dad? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.247
<i>Where are you?</i>

32:42.400 --> 32:46.041
Dad, Trey can handle all the filming
and stuff. It's not, like, a problem.

32:46.240 --> 32:49.449
Never mind about that. Are you safe?
Tell me where you are.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.046
<i>Safe? Yeah. I'm at the old paper mill.</i>

32:52.240 --> 32:54.766
- On Garner?
- Yeah.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.729
Listen, it's really important that you...

32:56.880 --> 32:59.281
<i>- Dad? Dad?
- Donnie?</i>

32:59.440 --> 33:01.090
- Dad?
- Stay <i>where</i> you are...

33:01.240 --> 33:02.287
Donnie?

33:03.640 --> 33:04.920
- Donnie!
- What happened?

33:05.040 --> 33:06.963
It just cut out. Here.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.520
Whoa.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.847
- Maybe we should go.
- Heh. Yeah.

33:18.840 --> 33:21.844
- What is that?
- I don't know.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.444
- Come on!
- Aah!

33:34.320 --> 33:35.810
It's all right. It's all right.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.804
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get my son. He's out there.

34:01.120 --> 34:02.360
Oh, my God.

34:02.560 --> 34:03.971
From our vantage point...

34:04.120 --> 34:06.088
<i>...the damage could have been
a whole lot worse.</i>

34:06.240 --> 34:08.208
<i>The tornado just narrowly grazed
the school...</i>

34:08.400 --> 34:09.764
Daryl, are you hearing this?

34:09.920 --> 34:11.649
...as <i>you can see from this footage.</i>

34:11.800 --> 34:15.485
<i>The National Weather Service is currently
tracking a second supercell...</i>

34:15.679 --> 34:18.411
<i>...moving in our direction.
I know it's hard to imagine...</i>

34:18.560 --> 34:20.562
A second cell.

34:20.719 --> 34:23.485
- This is gonna be bad.
- How can there be another system?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.286
I've never seen anything like this.
These updrafts are insane.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.484
Got downed power lines.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.280
- We're stuck.
- It's all right. I'm about to make his day.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.489
<i>We're gonna send it
back to Don Lemon in the studio.</i>

34:34.639 --> 34:36.483
Heads up, Lucas. Live wire.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.121
What else we got?

34:43.280 --> 34:45.521
Activity heading toward the center of town.

34:45.679 --> 34:46.726
Second cell?

34:46.880 --> 34:48.041
It's organized. The hook echo is huge.

34:48.199 --> 34:51.090
I wanna set up
as close to the perimeter as possible.

34:51.239 --> 34:52.480
I wanna be in the middle.

34:52.639 --> 34:54.210
- I'm not gonna miss it.
- I hear you.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.801
- Jake, how you doing?
<i>- Never better.</i>

34:56.960 --> 34:59.361
You hang in there, honey.
That was nothing. Here you go.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.841
Send that to my GPS. Let's roll. Come on.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.809
You want a coffee with that, boss?

35:06.320 --> 35:07.526
Kaitlyn?

35:10.440 --> 35:11.680
Kaitlyn!

35:13.200 --> 35:15.009
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah. My leg.

35:15.160 --> 35:16.525
Okay. Your leg?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.731
Here, let me see it.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.689
It really hurts.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.207
- Ugh.
- Hold on.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.160
Okay. All right, hang on.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.644
- Don't touch it.
- Ow.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.402
I'm gonna tie this, okay?

35:44.640 --> 35:46.404
- Be careful.
- Sorry.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.086
- All right?
- Yeah.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.568
What was Donnie doing there
in the first place?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.564
He's with Kaitlyn.
He's been in love with her forever.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.847
Johnston?

36:00.000 --> 36:03.641
Yeah. He's shooting this video project
thing for her.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.245
Why didn't he just tell me?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.563
I don't know, Dad. You're
so easy to talk to.

36:08.720 --> 36:10.085
I'm just saying.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.684
Whoa.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.008
Oh, my God.

36:25.720 --> 36:27.006
Hey, boy.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.406
<i>Hey-</i>

36:28.560 --> 36:30.403
Dad, that's Chester's dog.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.806
Chester?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.047
Chester?

36:36.040 --> 36:37.769
Chester!

36:41.760 --> 36:43.683
Dad, be careful!

36:45.560 --> 36:47.280
- You okay?
- Had to go looking for shelter.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.447
Was gonna drive.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.721
Let me see.

36:49.880 --> 36:51.291
- You hurt?
- Get the door.

36:55.720 --> 36:56.926
The belt's stuck.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.127
I gotta cut him out.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.209
Hey, can I get some help over here?

37:00.400 --> 37:01.811
Here.

37:02.400 --> 37:06.371
- I know, I'm not supposed to have that.
- We'll talk about that later. Hang on.

37:07.480 --> 37:08.970
- Put this under him.
- Yep.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.969
- Right there.
- Put him down.

37:13.760 --> 37:15.840
- Can you get everybody to the high school?
- Uh-huh.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.803
They've got a storm shelter.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.321
- You wanna go with them?
- No way.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.482
- Make sure he's okay.
- You got it.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.488
Oh, shit.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.125
Oh, come on.

37:41.320 --> 37:42.685
Try your phone again.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.521
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.727
- Anything?
- There's no signal.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.370
Damn it.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.170
There are those idiots.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.846
Pull over.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.365
Hey, Pete, you can pass us.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.842
- Allison, we don't have <i>time</i> to waste.
- Yeah, we'll catch up to you.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.367
Hello! Your main man Reevis here.

38:12.560 --> 38:14.369
- I'm with my buddy Donk.
- Badonkadonk! Heh.

38:14.560 --> 38:17.040
- What just happened?
- All right, so check this out.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.409
I was in a tornado, right?
And let me tell you. One word:

38:20.560 --> 38:23.325
- "it sucked." Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
That's two words, jackass.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.723
I know. Two words, but I was, like,
getting sucked up in the thing.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.723
It was smart back there with the knife.

38:28.880 --> 38:30.723
Thanks. I thought you'd be mad.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.446
Oh, I am. Hand it over.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.162
We should turn left on Main.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.366
I'm gonna take the highway.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.171
Dad, if we out through Main,
we can take Rosewood all the way.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.368
We save like 20 minutes.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.247
All right.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.926
Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, guys!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.650
Gentlemen!

38:54.080 --> 38:55.445
It's gonna be damn head. Ha-ha-ha.

38:55.640 --> 38:56.687
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.649
- You two need to go inside and stay there.
- Whoa.

38:58.800 --> 39:01.167
You guys actually get paid to do this shit?

39:01.320 --> 39:03.004
I'm in the wrong damn job, man.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.730
- You don't have a job.
- Heh.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.166
Let's go, Allison!

39:06.360 --> 39:09.887
Grab a brew.
It's like a zombie apocalypse out here.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.362
- We're wasting time.
- I don't think we can leave them.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.126
- Look. They're not our responsibility.
- They're drunk.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.282
- Guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You getting this?

39:18.440 --> 39:22.081
- Look, look. Donk, Donk.
- Oh. Hell, yeah! Ha, ha!

39:23.680 --> 39:25.125
Hell, yeah.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.850
Look at it.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.441
- Whoa, shit! Where did it go?
- Where'd it go? What?

39:32.360 --> 39:33.850
Where is it...?

39:34.000 --> 39:36.765
DARYL: It's moving, it's moving,
it's moving. Whoa.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.246
Hey, Allison, what's happening?

39:41.080 --> 39:42.411
Keep filming.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.130
- Whoa!
- Guys! Look at that!

39:49.320 --> 39:51.687
Reevis! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:51.840 --> 39:53.330
- Yeah!
- You getting it?

39:56.120 --> 39:58.771
No! No! Holy shit!

39:58.920 --> 40:00.524
'MY truck!
'Oh' my God!

40:07.320 --> 40:09.163
Dad!

40:19.080 --> 40:20.650
Get out and run for the bank!

40:21.960 --> 40:24.770
Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

40:24.920 --> 40:26.001
Oh, shit!

40:27.000 --> 40:29.128
- Oh, my God!
- Dad! Hurry!

40:29.320 --> 40:30.367
Go inside!

40:34.280 --> 40:35.327
Trey!

40:40.760 --> 40:42.285
God!

40:42.800 --> 40:44.325
Hang on!

40:44.480 --> 40:48.007
- Oh, my God! No, no, no!
- Hang on!

40:48.160 --> 40:49.685
Dad, hold on!

40:49.880 --> 40:53.009
- Oh, God! Aah!
- I've got you!

40:55.160 --> 40:56.207
Hold on!

40:56.360 --> 40:58.044
I won't let you go!

40:58.720 --> 40:59.767
Grab the door!

41:02.640 --> 41:04.722
No. Dad, no!

41:04.880 --> 41:06.405
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

41:13.720 --> 41:15.165
Are you okay?

41:15.320 --> 41:16.651
Yeah.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.370
- Allison, you okay?
- Come on, Trey. Let's get in the car.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.920
- Everyone here?
- Yeah.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.730
This is crazy, guys.

41:25.720 --> 41:28.485
Oh, shit.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.250
Whoa.

41:32.920 --> 41:35.844
Hey, can I use your cell?
My son's out there. I got no signal.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.968
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

41:38.120 --> 41:39.884
I don't either.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.087
Where is he?

41:41.240 --> 41:44.562
He said he was at an industrial park
on Garner Road.

41:44.720 --> 41:45.926
Is that north of here?

41:46.080 --> 41:48.606
- This is crazy.
- This is what we're paying you for.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.250
Give me one second.

41:50.440 --> 41:52.169
Guys, what's going on?

41:52.360 --> 41:56.046
Daryl, can you believe this?
Your buddy here wants to quit.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.767
Hey. No one's quitting here.
Just give us a minute, Pete.

41:59.920 --> 42:01.445
You got a minute.

42:02.680 --> 42:05.650
You'll be okay. Right?

42:06.840 --> 42:10.208
This is crazy, man, all right?
I mean, a truck almost fell on us.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.441
Relax.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.602
Make it through today, and by next week...

42:13.800 --> 42:16.804
...you got cash and you are sitting
on a beach sipping margaritas...

42:16.960 --> 42:20.646
...with that beautiful girlfriend of yours.
All right?

42:21.680 --> 42:24.081
- I don't even like margaritas.
- Heh. Trust me.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.722
Come on, we're wasting time.
Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.

42:27.880 --> 42:28.927
He's got this.

42:29.080 --> 42:31.447
- Let's get ready for the next system.
- All right.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.806
Another system?

42:32.960 --> 42:35.088
Wait a minute. That was going north, right?

42:35.280 --> 42:36.930
That's toward the paper mill.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.165
I gotta get there. Can you take us?
My car is totaled.

42:40.320 --> 42:43.483
- Sorry. No time.
- His son's out there.

42:43.640 --> 42:45.210
Pete.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.360
Just stay out of the way.

42:47.520 --> 42:49.409
You guys can come in the van with me.

42:49.560 --> 42:52.450
- I can take the kid with the camera.
- Really? Sweet.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.489
No, no, Trey, you're staying with me.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.480
Look, the <i>Titus</i> is the
safest place for him.

42:58.680 --> 43:01.843
He's right. It's a tank.
We'll be right behind him.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.480
- Just as far as Garner, okay?
- Right.

43:06.600 --> 43:10.605
Keep that camera rolling. When this is
over, I'll give you 3 grand for your tape.

43:10.760 --> 43:11.807
- Three grand?
- Yeah.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.804
- Heh. You got it.
- Now we're talking.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.291
Let's move!

43:19.760 --> 43:21.364
How's your leg?

43:22.800 --> 43:24.564
It's a bit better.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.125
Here.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.529
- Ah.
- All right?

43:40.600 --> 43:42.284
Okay.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.168
Where'd you learn that?

43:47.320 --> 43:50.051
Uh, my mom was a nurse...

43:51.120 --> 43:55.205
...so when we were kids, instead of
story time, we'd have, like, CPR lessons.

43:57.720 --> 44:01.247
At the time I was kind of lobbying
for Cat <i>in the</i> Hat, but now...

44:01.400 --> 44:04.051
Ha, ha. Yeah, thanks, Mom.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.522
- Okay?
- Yeah.

44:08.560 --> 44:10.289
Thanks.

44:21.080 --> 44:24.163
I told my parents I was
going to the library.

44:30.320 --> 44:32.607
Your dad is coming, right?

44:34.080 --> 44:36.162
Someone will find us.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.404
You okay?

44:47.680 --> 44:50.923
Look, I waited my whole life
for a storm like this.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.969
Please don't let me down.

44:59.920 --> 45:01.604
Who you trying to reach?

45:02.960 --> 45:04.405
My little girl, Gracie.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.643
I've never been away from her
this long before.

45:07.800 --> 45:09.564
Where is she?

45:09.720 --> 45:12.007
She's with my parents about 200 miles
to the south.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.123
They'll make sure she's safe.

45:16.960 --> 45:22.046
Yeah. It just really feels wrong
to be away from her right now. You know?

45:22.920 --> 45:24.809
How old is Gracie?

45:24.960 --> 45:26.007
She just turned 5.

45:26.760 --> 45:27.966
Wow.

45:28.160 --> 45:31.801
- They're a real handful at that age.
- She's a really good kid.

45:31.960 --> 45:33.803
How old is your other son?

45:34.000 --> 45:35.764
Donnie? He's 17.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.166
He'll be all right.
He knows everything at that age.

45:40.280 --> 45:43.489
After his mom died,
I kind of lost him for a while.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.404
We'll find him.

45:48.440 --> 45:52.001
So is this what you guys do for a living?
Go around chasing trouble?

45:52.800 --> 45:55.280
They chase. I study.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.164
Makes me the grown-up. Right, Daryl?

45:59.480 --> 46:01.608
I've never heard
of this many tornadoes before.

46:01.760 --> 46:05.003
It's a freak occurrence.
Two storm fronts taking the same path.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.607
It's not freak anymore.
Not after Katrina. Not after Joplin.

46:08.760 --> 46:12.367
What used to be once-in-a-lifetime
seems to be happening about once a year.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.363
Look what happened with Hurricane Sandy.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.443
Whatever it is, we have to figure it out...

46:16.600 --> 46:19.206
...before they start shifting to places
they've never been before.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.921
- Like where?
- Like Los Angeles. Or Chicago.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.646
Even London.

46:24.840 --> 46:27.161
<i>Tree blocking the road.</i>

46:27.320 --> 46:29.721
- We got a problem.
- Can you get around that?

46:30.280 --> 46:31.361
No.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.090
Moorpark. <i>Right,</i> Dad?

46:33.240 --> 46:36.005
<i>It's about three miles west.
It might be clear that far out.</i>

46:36.160 --> 46:37.207
Good call.

46:37.360 --> 46:39.522
Doubling back to Moorpark.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.448
That's a great boy you've got.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.563
Do you ever think about the last thing
you said to your mom?

46:52.320 --> 46:54.482
I think about it every day.

46:55.840 --> 46:57.410
Um...

46:59.280 --> 47:01.123
Because I was pissed at her.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.363
I was always pissed at her for something.

47:04.520 --> 47:07.763
For leaving Dad. For leaving me and Trey.

47:09.800 --> 47:13.088
We used to spend the weekends with her,
so she was...

47:14.000 --> 47:18.369
She was dropping us back, and she tried
to kiss me goodbye, and I just...

47:21.120 --> 47:24.203
I barely looked at her,
and she walked away.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.251
Yeah, that was it. That was the last time.

47:31.440 --> 47:33.283
What happened?

47:34.400 --> 47:36.448
It was a car accident.

47:38.800 --> 47:40.962
- I'm sorry.
- No.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.565
It's...

47:46.240 --> 47:48.049
You hear that?

47:48.200 --> 47:49.247
Hello?

47:49.400 --> 47:51.129
Hey! Hey, we're down here!

47:51.280 --> 47:53.089
- Hello?
- Please help us!

47:54.440 --> 47:56.520
- What happened?
- I think a pipe burst!

47:56.680 --> 47:58.921
Oh, my God!

48:01.480 --> 48:03.960
Get on it, Donk. You see anything yet?

48:04.120 --> 48:07.602
- I think the twister cloud's up ahead.
- Twister cloud?

48:07.960 --> 48:10.566
Shit! Slow down, Donk!
You're busting my balls!

48:10.720 --> 48:13.769
Straight over this hill!
You'll be fine! - No! Not the hill!

48:13.920 --> 48:15.331
Hey! Moron!

48:17.320 --> 48:19.129
Oh, my God!

48:19.280 --> 48:22.124
Ugh! Damn! You dumb-ass!

48:22.280 --> 48:24.442
- What the hell, man?
- Whoo! Yeah!

48:24.600 --> 48:27.729
- You all right, man?
- Yes! Ha-ha-ha.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.563
Whoa.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.802
Aw. This thing's awesome.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.086
- She's a beast.
- Absolutely.

48:46.280 --> 48:48.521
Wow, this is so cool.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.484
You gonna be all right?

48:54.000 --> 48:57.971
Look, I know I yell at you a lot.
But listen.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.803
When I first started,
I was scared shitless too.

49:02.640 --> 49:05.928
We got a lot riding on this.
But when the moment comes...

49:06.080 --> 49:08.048
...trust me, you're gonna be fine.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.290
Yes, sir.

49:11.520 --> 49:12.885
You getting this on radar?

49:13.040 --> 49:15.327
I see it. It's headed
fast in this direction.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.801
<i>I got three small hook echoes. Maybe four.</i>

49:17.960 --> 49:20.566
- D, you getting any visual on this?
- No. Nothing.

49:20.720 --> 49:22.802
I'm not seeing anything, you guys.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.564
What's happening up top, kid?

49:24.720 --> 49:29.089
I got nothing up here. Just clouds.
Wait, there it is. Right there on the left!

49:30.400 --> 49:32.846
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.

49:33.000 --> 49:34.570
We got movement to the northeast.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.045
Take a look at that!

49:39.880 --> 49:41.041
Guys, it's splitting.

49:43.040 --> 49:46.203
- We're gonna have another funnel.
- Something's happening behind us.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.566
There's another one.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.643
There's one to our right!

49:51.360 --> 49:52.805
Two.

49:54.600 --> 49:57.729
There are three. Four!
Shit, they're everywhere!

49:57.880 --> 50:00.645
We have multiple vortices touching down.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.525
These systems are too erratic.
We gotta get out of here.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.444
No, no, no!

50:16.480 --> 50:18.289
- Look at that thing!
- Aah!

50:18.440 --> 50:19.771
Oh, my God!

50:24.520 --> 50:26.329
Oh, God!

50:38.760 --> 50:40.280
Look at the size of that thing!

50:40.400 --> 50:43.006
We're gonna be YouTube stars
for the rest of our lives!

50:43.160 --> 50:45.527
Ha, ha! Better than sex, Donk! Ha-ha-ha.

50:45.680 --> 50:47.762
How would you know?

51:04.240 --> 51:05.321
Dad!

51:05.480 --> 51:06.686
Behind us!

51:14.520 --> 51:15.567
Is everybody all right?

51:15.760 --> 51:16.807
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.

51:22.920 --> 51:24.604
Oh, shit.

51:49.520 --> 51:51.682
- Keep filming!
- Yeah, I got it!

51:51.840 --> 51:53.649
This is unbelievable!

51:53.800 --> 51:55.723
- Dad!
- Are you all right?

51:55.920 --> 51:59.049
I can't get out the side.
We're gonna go through the back.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.362
- Trey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

52:03.480 --> 52:04.527
Let's go!

52:04.720 --> 52:07.405
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on. Come on.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.921
- Trey!
- Over here!

52:12.800 --> 52:16.771
We gotta take cover! Everybody in
the Titus! Run! Let's move! Move!

52:16.920 --> 52:18.684
- Come on!
- Let's go!

52:18.840 --> 52:20.330
Look out!

52:21.360 --> 52:22.964
Come on!

52:23.880 --> 52:25.769
Everybody head for the church!

52:25.920 --> 52:27.968
- Come on, Trey, stay with me!
- Look out!

52:28.160 --> 52:29.207
Holy shit!

52:31.480 --> 52:33.005
Oh, my God!

52:43.360 --> 52:45.761
This is amazing! I gotta get this!

52:46.840 --> 52:47.887
Jake, forget it!

52:48.400 --> 52:50.323
Jake, come on!

52:51.120 --> 52:52.167
Allison!

52:58.920 --> 53:00.570
- Jake!
- Jacob!

53:00.720 --> 53:02.449
- My camera!
- Leave it!

53:02.600 --> 53:04.250
But I gotta get the footage!

53:04.400 --> 53:06.129
Jake, come on! Let's go!

53:06.280 --> 53:08.203
Shit!

53:10.160 --> 53:11.924
- No! No, no, no!
- Come on!

53:12.120 --> 53:14.282
Help me! No, no, no!

53:21.440 --> 53:24.922
- No! Jacob!
- No! He's gone! Allison, he's gone!

53:25.080 --> 53:26.320
- Get inside!
- Shut the door!

53:26.480 --> 53:27.891
Come on, come on, come on!

53:34.000 --> 53:35.490
Get down!

53:35.640 --> 53:37.130
Okay.

53:42.360 --> 53:43.566
Oh, shit.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.763
Trey. Trey!

53:56.960 --> 53:58.644
I'm here, Dad.

54:00.640 --> 54:03.325
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.441
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting my son.

54:08.640 --> 54:10.881
Please, wait. It isn't safe out there.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.849
What if it was your daughter?

54:14.240 --> 54:15.765
Um...

54:16.440 --> 54:20.445
If we can get the van back on the road, we'll
be safer than we would be on foot. Okay?

54:20.600 --> 54:22.443
Pete, can you hook up...?

54:27.080 --> 54:28.570
Is that all you care about?

54:30.560 --> 54:32.210
No. No.

54:32.360 --> 54:34.681
Jacob's dead, Pete.

54:35.360 --> 54:38.170
He'd probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

54:39.400 --> 54:41.289
You think what happened is my fault?

54:43.520 --> 54:46.444
I mean, he wasn't out there shooting
for himself, was he?

54:46.920 --> 54:49.321
He was getting your shot for your movie...

54:49.480 --> 54:52.962
...because you told him nothing else
matters, and you wouldn't let him go.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.360
No.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.604
It wasn't Pete.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.970
It was me.

55:00.560 --> 55:02.927
I brought him here. It was my fault.

55:03.080 --> 55:06.562
No. No. None of this should have happened.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.529
You gotta help him find his son.

55:08.680 --> 55:10.648
I will. What about you?

55:11.720 --> 55:13.643
I'm gonna stay here.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.524
I'll see if I can find Jacob's parents.
Get in contact with them.

55:19.600 --> 55:20.931
Okay.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.443
- Help me close up the gap!
- Huh?

55:23.600 --> 55:25.728
Help me close it up!

55:30.120 --> 55:32.088
- Can you stop it coming in?
- I'm trying!

55:38.960 --> 55:40.769
Lucas, you coming?

55:41.400 --> 55:42.526
Pete...

55:42.680 --> 55:46.162
Suit yourself. I gotta finish this.

55:47.080 --> 55:48.411
Trey, come on. Get in.

55:48.560 --> 55:50.642
- Let's go find your brother.
- All right.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.407
Come on, baby.

56:01.760 --> 56:02.807
Come on.

56:04.200 --> 56:05.964
That's my girl.

56:06.120 --> 56:08.248
Dad, it's getting worse out there.

56:14.360 --> 56:16.283
Still no signal.

56:24.120 --> 56:26.646
My phone. It's not working.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.802
<i>Try yours.</i>

56:29.640 --> 56:31.608
No, there's no signal.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.202
- Try it through the gap right there.
- Okay.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.488
Your arm can fit.

56:36.840 --> 56:40.242
- Oh, my God. There's a bar, there's a bar.
- Put it on speakerphone!

56:40.400 --> 56:42.323
<i>This is Gary. Leave</i> a <i>message.</i>

56:42.480 --> 56:44.642
Dad! Dad! Please help us!

56:44.800 --> 56:47.883
The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...

56:48.040 --> 56:50.168
...and I don't know how long we've got!

56:50.320 --> 56:51.560
Dad!

56:51.760 --> 56:52.841
Aah.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.764
Oh, shit!

56:54.920 --> 56:56.843
Oh, shit.

56:57.760 --> 56:59.762
I'm sorry. It's dead.

56:59.920 --> 57:01.649
I'm sorry.

57:09.080 --> 57:12.289
Are you folks all right?
I'm taking these people to the shelter.

57:12.440 --> 57:15.762
- You been by the industrial park?
- Sure have. Whole place has been flattened.

57:15.920 --> 57:19.163
- Did you see anyone? A boy? A girl?
- I didn't see anybody. I'm sorry.

57:19.320 --> 57:22.324
- Maybe he made it to the school.
- What if he didn't? We gotta go.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.324
Listen. I heard on the radio,
all the warning sirens are down.

57:25.480 --> 57:27.767
If a tornado's coming,
you're not gonna know it.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.045
Okay.

57:32.120 --> 57:33.360
Mom.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.965
Dad.

57:38.120 --> 57:40.930
I just wanna thank you for everything.

57:45.640 --> 57:49.770
I was gonna come down the stairs
this morning to say goodbye...

57:50.320 --> 57:52.527
...but when I came you were already gone.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.886
I got a message.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.520
<i>Dad! Dad! Please help us!</i>

57:56.680 --> 57:59.570
<i>The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring</i> in...

57:59.720 --> 58:02.883
- ...and <i>I</i> don't know how long we've <i>got!</i>
- Oh, my God.

58:03.480 --> 58:05.721
You should know I'm not alone.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.128
Donnie's here.

58:12.560 --> 58:15.769
He's been really sweet.

58:20.760 --> 58:25.368
So it's kind of okay.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.442
I love you so much.

58:39.360 --> 58:41.044
Guess what.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.766
I spent the last week filming time capsules
about people's futures...

58:46.840 --> 58:49.207
...and now it looks like I don't have one.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.004
So, uh...

58:53.600 --> 58:55.682
...if there's no future...

58:56.720 --> 58:58.768
...we should talk about the past.

58:59.400 --> 59:00.561
Um...

59:01.320 --> 59:03.721
Some bad shit happened along the way.

59:03.880 --> 59:06.884
You know, like it does
to everybody, I guess.

59:08.080 --> 59:09.491
And...

59:11.000 --> 59:14.243
And I didn't move on, Dad. I blamed you.

59:15.640 --> 59:19.929
I really gave you shit,
and I wish I hadn't.

59:21.280 --> 59:24.727
I so wish I hadn't.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.688
No point in wishing now, huh?

59:31.880 --> 59:33.723
What do I wanna say? Um...

59:35.320 --> 59:37.368
Go easy on Trey.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.726
He's gonna tell you that
this is all his fault.

59:40.920 --> 59:43.844
This was his idea. But it wasn't.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.970
It's just Trey. His
attention-seeking behavior.

59:48.240 --> 59:50.129
My idea.

59:51.560 --> 59:53.164
My fault.

59:55.160 --> 59:59.563
Trey, you should be the person you always
were, dude, because you're awesome.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.721
You're awesome and I'm proud of you...

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.724
...and just live every
day like it's your last.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.121
Because, shit, someday it will be.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.646
And for once, I know
what I'm talking about.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.250
And, Dad...

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.729
Dad, I love you.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.964
I really love you and I'm sorry.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.009
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.242
Okay. Sorry.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.601
Sorry.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.086
Come here.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.605
Okay.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.807
All right.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.283
Come on.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.171
Take a left here.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.451
Donnie!

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.971
Donnie!

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.246
Trey!

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.243
Look!

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.840
Hello?

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.411
It's Donnie's!

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.606
Donnie!

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.807
Donnie!

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.570
Where are you?

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.960
Kaitlyn!

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.088
Over here!

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.082
He said there was water pouring in, right?

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.004
Dad! Over here!

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.481
Listen! Nobody move!

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.688
We're over here!

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.446
- Donnie!
- Dad!

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.130
- Where is he?
- It's okay.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.362
- Donnie, I'm here!
- We got you.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.769
It's okay! I'm here! I got you!
It's Dad! Can you hear me?

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.207
Dad! Trey!

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:01.967
Dad!

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.566
Dad, you've gotta help him!

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.722
Can you swim through? There's a gap here!

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.006
Now you hold on!

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.281
Donnie!

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.366
Gary, I can't move it!

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.764
We gotta move this! We gotta move
this I-beam! Come on, push it!

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.725
- It's not gonna move.
- Dad!

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.840
- Donnie, you're okay.
- Help me get her out.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:24.967
You're doing good.

01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.281
We're gonna get you out.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.565
Trey, what are you doing?

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.250
Watch out!

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:31.890
Okay, I need you to duck down!

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.849
We're gonna move this beam!
You understand?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.161
Got it!

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.725
You guys Okay?

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.769
I got it. I got it. All right.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.610
- Kaitlyn, come on.
- Are you okay?

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.082
- I got you, I got you.
- Let's go, let's go. Get her out.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.330
Donnie!

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.570
Donnie!

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.043
- Donnie!
- I got him.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.361
Pull him up!

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.851
I got his head.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.365
Get him up.

01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.767
Donnie?

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.410
Right here. Here we go.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.085
Donnie!

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:54.526
Donnie?

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.722
Put this under his head.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:59.290
He's not breathing!

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.891
Oh, God!

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.649
- Donnie!
- Oh, my God.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.122
Donnie!

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.929
Breathe!

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.690
Come on!

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:38.328
Go on. Cough it up. There you go.
Come here.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.682
There you go, son. Cough it up.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.129
Here. It's okay.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.607
<i>I</i> got you.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.649
Kaitlyn.
- it's okay. She's here.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.325
It's okay.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.251
I love you, son.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.845
We got him now. We got him now.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.240
Come here.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.209
- I love you both.
- Donnie.

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.249
So much.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.369
I thought you might need some help.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.683
Never thought I'd be happy
to see your face again.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.045
Getting my hard drives.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.090
- You were down there?
- Yeah.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.322
- Camera rolling?
Uh-huh.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.764
- Mm.
- Yeah, there's the guy I know.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.888
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- Come on.

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:37.451
Everybody in the Titus.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.922
<i>We are tracking</i> a <i>massive tornado.</i>

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:43.326
Pete, you seeing this?

01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.680
<i>- There's</i> a <i>second tornado formation.
</i>- I <i>see it.</i>

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.770
<i>This storm is heading northwest.
There. And it just touched down.</i>

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.806
<i>We now have two very large tornadoes
moving towards the town of Silverton.</i>

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.282
<i>All residents of Shaw County
should seek shelter immediately.</i>

01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:59.762
<i>They are converging, which could
generate wind speeds of up to</i> a...

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.400
<i>There! There they go!
They just converged.</i>

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:06.810
<i>We are looking at wind speeds inside
the funnel of over 300 miles per hour.</i>

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.201
<i>This is definitely an EF5.</i>

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.721
This is the biggest tornado I've ever seen.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.322
- The school.
- The whole town's in there.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.562
Warning systems are out.

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.884
They're sitting ducks.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.561
Okay, everybody out. Now. Let's go.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.807
Hurry! Get out! Go!

01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.883
What are you doing? You out of your mind?

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.647
- There is another tornado heading this way.
- And you want us to go outside?

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.560
- You don't understand.
- You have to.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:50.682
This is the storm shelter, for chrissake.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.604
- Not for this.
- Would you believe us?

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.603
We've been out there.
We know what this can do.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.684
I am not going to risk it.
I've got hundreds of people here.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.922
You will have hundreds of dead people
if you stay.

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.327
Sir. I've studied storms all my life,
all right?

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.643
This is bigger than any storm
that has ever been. Can you hear that?

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.644
- It will flatten this building in seconds.
- Exactly.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.963
With or without you, we're getting
these people onto those buses.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.962
- Trey, stay with me. Stay close.
- Okay.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.250
Come on, everybody!
Get on the buses! Move!

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:22.807
We gotta go.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.360
That one! That one over there!

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.122
- Stay with us!
- Let's go! Let's go!

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.127
Come on, move!

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.169
Trey, put the camera down
and get on the bus.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.328
- I'm coming.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.641
Come on, folks.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.129
Come on! Let's go!

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.165
Everybody on. Move, move, move.

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.560
Come on, get in there.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.046
Trey, get in.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.845
- Come on, Trey, come on, come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.284
Hold on.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.846
Holy shit. Lucas, you getting this?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.764
Yeah. We good.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:38.363
- How we looking?
- It's still picking up speed.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:45.524
Dad! Dad, the tower's coming down!

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.810
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out!
- Hang on!

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.243
Dad, be careful!

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.609
- We can't get through. There's no way
around. We don't have any time.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.240
- We gotta go back.
- Okay.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.331
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:22.768
Come in the bus.
Come in the bus with us.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.531
You guys, we gotta back up!
We gotta go back and find a road!

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.281
Gary, we need cover.
We can't stay in the open.

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.403
It's moving too fast.
We're not gonna outrun it.

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.844
<i>The road's blocked. We gotta turn around.</i>

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.603
- No, Dad, pull over up here.
- What?

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.924
Dad, trust me, okay? I filmed here.
There's a storm drain. Right over there.

01:09:48.439 --> 01:09:51.171
- Okay, everybody get off.
- All right, come on! Come on!

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.088
All right, this way!

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.131
Come on, you guys. Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.807
- Come on!
- Follow me this way!

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.442
Dad! Dad! We can't get in this way!

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.041
- Go in through the manhole!
- Manhole?

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.043
- You got a crowbar?
- Yeah.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.847
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Lucas!

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.725
Come on.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.324
Here we go.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.249
- Okay, everybody in.
- Everybody in!

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.171
- Come on. Let's go. Go! Go!
- Okay. Okay. Donnie!

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.163
Get in.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:42.167
Jesus!

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.849
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.604
Come on!

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.329
- Now! Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.320
Lucas, get in! Go, move! Go!

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.763
- Right behind me, guys!
- Yeah, go!

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.286
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:12.611
- Give me a hand.
- I got it.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.601
- Close it!
- Come on!

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.047
Oh, shit!

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.807
- You guys all right?
- The truck opened the other end! Hang on!

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.571
It's gonna be a wind tunnel in here!
Hold on tight!

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.768
- Oh, my God, the grate's loose!
- Hold on!

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.924
- We're gonna get sucked out!
- Keep your head down!

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.801
Hey, this footage and data
could save lives one day!

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.041
What are you doing?

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.570
Pete?

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.250
- No, no! Wait!
- Allison!

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.526
Pete!

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.247
Pete!

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.407
Lucas! Give me that!

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.164
Peter, please, come back!

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.160
Gary!

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.563
No! Allison! I can't reach!

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.285
- Give me your hand!
- Aah!

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.161
Come on!

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.848
Come on. Come here!

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.641
Allison! Here. Come on.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.287
You Okay?

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.771
Yeah.

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.605
Okay, anchor down.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.367
- What's he doing?
- He's trying to plug the hole!

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.130
Damn it. She won't stay anchored.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.164
Allison! Allison!

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.560
<i>Can you hitch the winch to something solid?</i>

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.842
- The truck!
- Yeah.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.206
- The release.
- Here.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.049
Okay, I got it.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:05.564
- We're good!
- All right, Pete, we're set.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.370
<i>You can tighten her up.</i>

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.123
Okay, then.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.250
Titus versus tornado.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.647
- Dad, hang on!
- Gary!

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.642
Hang on!

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.321
Is that it? Is it over?

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.323
Pete, what's happening? Did it pass us?

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.010
It's not gonna last.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.810
We're in the eye.

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.484
Oh, God.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.522
Guys, the trailing winds will be
even stronger! You've gotta hang on!

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.767
Okay.

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.729
Hold on tight.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.051
Hold on!

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:24.202
Donnie! Get down!

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.409
It's not gonna hold!

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.721
Peter!

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.564
No!

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.244
Grab my hand! No!

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.244
- No!
- Gary!

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.007
<i>And let's see. We're gonna stay right here.</i>

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.571
<i>We're gonna see if it re-cycles.</i>

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:47.007
<i>It's becoming more of a barrel-shaped.</i>

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.324
<i>The wedge has decreased a little bit, and it
looks like it's roping out at Air Depot Road.</i>

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.970
<i>Look at the rope on that thing.</i>

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.920
<i>Feeder band looks like it's pretty low
to the ground. It's way lower than we are.</i>

01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.606
<i>There it is. It's gone, Mike.</i>

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.841
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.526
- Yeah, we're good.
- You're okay.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.487
Trey?

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:49.882
<i>This was a storm that was on the
ground for at least 10 miles before it hit.</i>

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:53.283
<i>...assault by giant tornadoes.
And look how powerful they are.</i>

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:56.603
<i>One tornado is already being
called the largest tornado in history.</i>

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.840
<i>The intense storm
that set off the twisters...</i>

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.769
<i>...dropped golf ball to
baseball-sized hail.</i>

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:05.443
<i>There's no denying the tragedy
that we've all endured here today.</i>

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.284
<i>But you know...</i>

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.081
<i>...our faith will carry us through,
and we will rebuild.</i>

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:24.288
I'm sorry about Pete.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:31.681
Hey, little bug.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:33.444
<i>Hey-</i>

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.728
No, Mama's okay. I'm okay.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.325
I am. I promise.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.482
I'm coming home.

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:42.007
Yeah, Mama's coming home.

01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.241
I love you too.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.326
<i>In 25 years?</i>

01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.768
It doesn't matter, you know?

01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:01.766
Just taking it one day at a time.

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:04.207
Every day's just fine.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.403
Because I'm alive.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.050
That's it.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.611
Nothing else matters.

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.842
Sometimes I think the human race
as a species is crazy.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.685
But when the chips are down...

01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.571
...ordinary people, like you and me...

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:23.131
...are good.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.645
I like that.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.521
You know, Pete and I had our moments...

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.926
...but I know why he got up every morning.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.048
And I know why he gave up his life.

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:36.567
He wanted to make a difference and...

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.445
Um...

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.963
Well, hopefully this film
will help accomplish that.

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.360
Huh?

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:51.966
Uh, to be honest,
it didn't look good back there.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.406
But we made it.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.404
We stuck together, and here we are.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:58.085
Alive.

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.127
I'm just grateful that we'll be able
to look back on this in 25 years.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.080
Twenty-five years?
Wow. You are gonna be so old.

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:07.571
- Heh.
- And probably bald too.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.960
All right, you're cut off.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.566
Donnie, you have something
you wanna say?

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.768
Uh, I don't think we really have
to say anything, you know?

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.446
We're all here now. Together.

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.924
And that's all that matters.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.889
Yeah, it is.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.323
Okay. Let's get back to work.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.690
<i>Hey! Donk!</i>

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:37.842
<i>Donk, where are you?</i>

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.764
Over here!

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.285
Hey, you're upside down!

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:45.046
No, you're upside down!
And you're in a tree!

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.004
Well, so are you!

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:48.207
Oh, yeah.

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.283
That camera still working?

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.488
- Yeah, it is!
- Ha, ha.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.723
- Man, we are gonna be so rich!
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:56.967
<i>Oh, shit! Donk!</i>

01:23:57.305 --> 01:24:03.408
