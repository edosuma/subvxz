WEBVTT

00:07.675 --> 00:10.711
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.681
LENNOX, I LOVE THE DRESS.
YOU HAVE GREAT STYLE.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.684
THANK ME VERY MUCH. OKAY,
NOW ONTO FOOTWEAR.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.719
REMEMBER, THE DANCE
IS SEMIFORMAL

00:18.752 --> 00:20.721
AND I DON'T WANT TO LOOK
LIKE I CARE THAT MUCH.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.391
'CAUSE YOU DON'T. I
MEAN CLEARLY YOU DON'T.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.095
- ALL RIGHT, SHOES.
- READY? LEG THING.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.297
RETRO IRONIC.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.599
HIPSTER BADASS.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.102
IRONIC AND BADASS.

00:34.135 --> 00:37.405
WHY CAN'T WOMEN PICK OUT
CLOTHES FOR THEMSELVES?

00:37.438 --> 00:41.275
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY, "OH MY GOD,
YOU LOOK SO CUTE" TO YOURSELF.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.145
ALL RIGHT, WHICH SHOE
IS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.747
- COMBAT BOOT.
- COMBAT BOOT IT IS.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.649
MAKES YOU WONDER HOW
SOLDIERS DANCE.

00:48.682 --> 00:51.152
ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME SWEATERS.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.720
OH, I ALREADY DECIDED.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.389
NO! ALL ON YOUR OWN?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.125
I THOUGHT YOU NEEDED TWO KEYS

00:57.158 --> 01:00.194
AND A SECRET PASSCODE
TO DEPLOY A SWEATER.

01:00.228 --> 01:03.164
THIS ONE FOR AT NIGHT AND
THIS ONE FOR IN THE MORNING.

01:03.197 --> 01:07.668
IN THE MORNING? I-I-I THOUGHT THIS
DANCE ENDS PROMPTLY AT 11:00 P.M.

01:07.701 --> 01:10.671
YES, BUT AFTERWARDS THERE'S AN
ALL-NIGHT PARTY THAT LASTS...

01:10.704 --> 01:13.674
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS...
ALL NIGHT.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.377
IT DOESN'T SAY IT ON THE FLYER.

01:17.678 --> 01:21.649
"ALL-NIGHT PARTY."

01:21.682 --> 01:23.717
- IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE FLYER.
- YEAH.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.719
HE JUST MISSED IT.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.388
HOW COME I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

01:27.421 --> 01:30.691
WELL, I GUESS BECAUSE I DON'T
LOVE THE LECTURE SO MUCH.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.727
I DON'T LECTURE. I INFORM.
I GUIDE. I INSTRUCT.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.597
YOU BORE. YOU BULLY. YOU BLAH.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.100
OH, I NEED TO SHOW
YOU EARRING OPTIONS.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.602
DID YOU GO IN MY
JEWELRY BOX AGAIN?

01:41.635 --> 01:44.705
ACTUALLY, NEVER MIND.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.309
YOU KNOW, BURKE, SOMETIMES
I THINK YOU INTENTIONALLY

01:48.342 --> 01:50.378
WITHHOLD INFORMATION FROM
ME JUST TO PISS ME OFF.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.146
I DO NOT DO IT TO PISS YOU OFF.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.715
I DO IT TO MAKE ME LAUGH.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.585
OH, YOU LOOK SO CUTE IN THAT.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.119
( theme music playing )

01:59.153 --> 02:02.256
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

02:02.290 --> 02:04.758
♪ WITH ME ♪

02:06.227 --> 02:07.661

OKAY WITH LENNOX

02:07.695 --> 02:10.164
- GOING TO THIS -
YES, I AM.PARTY?

02:10.198 --> 02:12.633
AND YOU'RE AWARE THAT YOU'VE
CHECK TO GO HAVE SEX? BLANK

02:12.666 --> 02:14.168
IS THAT WHAT I'VE DONE?

02:14.202 --> 02:17.104
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT ON THE FLYER.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.639
IT DOESN'T? ARE YOU SURE?
LET ME...

02:18.672 --> 02:22.610
I COULD HAVE SWORN I
SAW THAT SOMEWHERE.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.213
LOOK AT THAT, SEE?
YOU JUST MISSED IT.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.781
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE IN
HER SOCIAL LIFE. YOU

02:27.815 --> 02:29.717
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
SOMEBODY'S ON TOP OF THIS.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.653
YEAH WELL, DON'T WORRY. ALL
THE TIME.K ABOUT THIS STUFF

02:32.686 --> 02:35.556
REALLY? YOU TALK TO
HER ABOUT HAVING...

02:35.589 --> 02:37.591
THAT?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.793
YES WE DO BECAUSE
TEENAGERS HAVE SEX.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.463
SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX SEX!

02:42.496 --> 02:43.664
ARE YOU DONE?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.799
SEX! DONE NOW.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.636
ANYWAY, I KNOW THAT LENNOX
IS NOT READY FOR THAT.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.471
- REALLY?
- SHE TOLD ME.NOW THAT?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.340
OH, SHE TOLD YOU.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.242
OH WELL, I FEEL SO
MUCH BETTER NOW.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.278
COME ON, MEL, WHEN YOU
EVER LIE TO YOUR MOTHER?

02:57.311 --> 03:00.614
OH YEAH. YEAH, BUT
ONLY WHEN WE TALKED.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.783
LOOK, I AM NOT LENNOX'S MOTHER.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.885
SHE AND I ARE REALLY CLOSE.
I TRUST HER.

03:04.918 --> 03:08.322
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
TAKING HER TO THE DANCE.UY

03:08.356 --> 03:10.258
- I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST HIM.
- YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.561
I KNOW HE'S A TEENAGE BOY.
TO CONVICT.THAT'S ENOUGH

03:13.594 --> 03:15.829
ALL RIGHT, HIS NAME
IS BRENDAN FLYNN.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
SHE'S TOLD ME ALL ABOUT HIM.
THEY'VE BEEN GOING OUT

03:17.731 --> 03:20.234
FOR FOUR WEEKS NOW A
BADBOY.VE ME, HE'S NOT

03:20.268 --> 03:23.271
AFTER YEARS OF TRAINING,
BADBOYDAR.HLY-DEVELOPED

03:23.304 --> 03:24.872
IT'S MY SUPERPOWER.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.708
WHAT DO THEY FLASH UP
IN THE SKY FOR THAT?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.577
IT DOESN'T STOP CRIME BUT
IT COMES IN VERY HANDY

03:29.610 --> 03:31.779
WHEN THERE'S A TEENAGE
GIRL IN THE HOUSE.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.614
HEY, GUYS. WITH HOLLY
AND CHARLOTTE.M

03:33.647 --> 03:35.916
HEY, IF YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
UP THERE, SHUT THE DOOR.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.918
GOT IT.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.627
BURKE, YOU JUST LET WITH
TWO GIRLS.O UPSTAIRS

03:46.660 --> 03:49.297
- IT'S RYDER.
- OH YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.568
OH, EXCUSE ME, CHARLOTTE.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.737
I THINK MY BOYFRIEND
WANTS TO SIT NEXT TO ME.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.672
OH SURE, HOLLY.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.874
HOW ABOUT IF I JUST
SIT IN THE MIDDLE...

04:00.908 --> 04:03.944
OF THE SEAT YOU ASSIGNED ME?

04:05.813 --> 04:08.416
EACH STUDY GROUP WILL
MAKE A PRESENTATION

04:08.449 --> 04:11.285
ON THE SIGNIFICANCE ASSIGNED NOVEL.
THEIR

04:11.319 --> 04:13.287
I ALREADY GOOGLED
"HUMAN BONDAGE."

04:13.321 --> 04:15.656
NOT A LOT OF STUFF
ABOUT THE BOOK.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.625
THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL.

04:17.658 --> 04:19.927
PHILLIP IS HELD PRISONER,
A KIND OF BONDAGE,

04:19.960 --> 04:21.795
BY HIS LOVE FOR MILDRED.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.831
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE STAYS WITH HER.
SHE'S SO CRUEL.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.766
YEAH, YOU WONDER
WHAT THE POOR GUY...

04:25.799 --> 04:27.701
OH, HE'S A WUSS.

04:27.735 --> 04:31.539
MILDRED IS JUST TRYING TO
HELP HIM SHAPE UP, BE A MAN.

04:31.572 --> 04:34.308
- ISN'T THAT CORRECT, RYDER?
- I DISAGREE.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.378
EXCUSE ME?

04:37.411 --> 04:40.648
I JUST THINK MILDRED IS UNREDEEMABLE
FOR THE WAY THAT SHE ABUSES PHILLIP.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.784
CHARLOTTE, WOULD YOU BE A DEAR AND
GET US ALL SOMETHING TO DRINK?

04:43.817 --> 04:46.954
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- OH, OKAY.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.460
YOU KNOW, I THINK CHARLOTTE IS A
GREAT ADDITION TO OUR STUDY GROUP.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.863
YEAH, IT'S TOO BAD WE'RE
GONNA HAVE TO LET HER GO.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.365
WHAT?

04:57.398 --> 04:58.966
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE ATTACKED ME?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.469
HOW ARE WE GONNA EXPLAIN
TO HER THAT SHE'S OUT?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.837
JUST BREAK IT TO HER GENTLY.

05:03.871 --> 05:07.641
YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN YOU PULL OFF A
BAND-AID SLOWLY SO IT DOESN'T HURT.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.778
I THINK THAT MAKES IT HURT MORE.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.415
DOES IT?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.652
HEY, BRENDAN, YOU GONNA
STAY FOR DINNER?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.921
- YOU WANT ME TO PUT A PLATE OUT FOR YOU?
- WISH I COULD, MISS BURKE.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.757
BUT MY MOM HAS TO WORK LATE SO I NEED
TO COOK DINNER FOR MY LITTLE BROTHERS.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.427
WELL, AREN'T YOU RESPONSIBLE?

05:26.460 --> 05:29.697
BE NICE IF SOME PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE
STARTED DOING MORE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.932
JOE, I WANT DINNER!

05:31.965 --> 05:33.967
WHERE THE HELL IS THAT GUY?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.036
WELL, I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.738
AND TRY NOT TO LOOK
TOO BEAUTIFUL.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.408
- IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE OTHER GIRLS.
- OH, SHUT UP.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.781
- HELLO.
- ( gasps )

05:47.815 --> 05:49.683
AND WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.952
SIT.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.087
YOU'RE BRENDAN, RIGHT?

05:54.121 --> 05:55.823
YES SIR. YOU MUST BE JOE.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.526
YES I MUST, AT ALL TIMES.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.062
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WAS
CALLING YOU ABOUT DINNER.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.331
YEAH, THAT'S NOT REALLY
YOUR CONCERN, SON.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.568
SO YOU'RE THE GUY TAKING
LENNOX TO THIS DANCE, HUH?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.438
SO WHAT KIND OF DANCE DO YOU LIKE? YOU
LIKE FAST DANCE, SLOW DANCE, WHAT?

06:10.471 --> 06:13.507
- UM, FAST DANCE, SIR.
- IT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.709
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW
ME A FEW MOVES?

06:16.844 --> 06:19.379
- WAIT, REALLY?
- YEAH. YEAH.

06:19.413 --> 06:20.714
UP UP UP UP. LET'S GO, COME ON.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.784
UM...

06:30.023 --> 06:33.694
YOU CAN SIT BACK DOWN NOW.
THANK YOU.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.664
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT AFTER THIS ALL-NIGHT PARTY

06:36.697 --> 06:39.500
LENNOX IS RETURNED TO THIS HOUSE IN
THE SAME CONDITION THAT SHE LEFT.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.536
- GOT IT?
- YES SIR. I THINK SO.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.672
NO NO NO. YOU DON'T
THINK, ALL RIGHT?

06:44.705 --> 06:47.107
YOU JUST DO. OR IN THIS CASE,

06:47.140 --> 06:50.444
YOU DON'T DO. ARE WE CLEAR?

06:50.478 --> 06:52.813
- VERY CLEAR.
- GOOD.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.048
NOW LOOK...

06:55.082 --> 06:57.818
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE TWICE.
YOU READY?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.490
OKAY.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.826
I'M JUST KIDDING. I'M NOT
GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.462
WELL, I MAY PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE, BUT
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO HOME, OKAY?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.568
YOU SHOULD BE OVER THERE AT THE MEETING.
THEY NEED YOU.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.604
LOOK, I GOT THE CITY CONTROLLER
AND THE TRANSIT LEADER

07:16.637 --> 07:18.138
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER
WITH NO SHARP OBJECTS

07:18.171 --> 07:20.173
AND A DOUGHNUT SAMPLER.
IT'LL BE FINE.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.811
WE'RE FOUR HOURS AWAY FROM A STRIKE
DEADLINE. THINGS ARE GETTING CRITICAL.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.014
THIS IS CRITICALLER.
LENNOX NEEDS LIPSTICK.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.683
THE SEMIFORMAL IS IN A COUPLE OF
HOURS AND SHE'S COUNTING ON ME

07:29.717 --> 07:31.785
TO BRING HOME THE RIGHT SHADE.
AND IF I MESS THIS UP

07:31.819 --> 07:34.421
SHE'LL NEVER LET ME RUN
ERRANDS FOR HER AGAIN.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.724
FINE, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

07:36.757 --> 07:39.727
SHE SAID SHE WANTS THE
COLOR OF BUBBLEGUM.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.863
GROSS, BUT ACTUALLY HELPFUL.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.767
CRISIS AVERTED. SO TELL ME ABOUT
THE GUY SHE'S GOING WITH.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.837
OH, BRENDAN'S A SWEETHEART.
HE'S GOT BROWN HAIR.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.640
YOU KNOW, NERDY CUTE.
VERY RESPONSIBLE.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.808
IN FACT HE LOOKS A LOT
LIKE THAT BOY OVER THERE.

07:54.842 --> 07:55.943
WAIT, ACTUALLY THAT IS HIM.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.782
- THE ONE BUYING CONDOMS?
- UH-HUH.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.084
HE IS RESPONSIBLE.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.600
LENNOX, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT AWAY!

08:19.633 --> 08:21.535
NOTHING IMPORTANT!

08:21.569 --> 08:23.503
LENNOX IS NOT HERE, MEL.
SHE HAD TO RUN OUT

08:23.537 --> 08:25.573
FOR SOME LAST MINUTE
DANCE-RELATED EMERGENCY.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.909
AND THEN I SORT OF TUNED HER OUT...
SELF-PRESERVATION

08:28.942 --> 08:31.812
WELL, I GOT HER THE
LIPSTICK SHE ASKED FOR.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.214
AND WHILE I WAS AT THE DRUGSTORE,
FUNNIEST THING IN THE WORLD...

08:34.247 --> 08:37.517
WELL, YOU KNOW, NOT FUNNY
HA-HA, BUT FUNNY WEIRD...

08:37.551 --> 08:40.621
I SAW A TEENAGE BOY
BUYING CONDOMS.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.623
WHAT'S FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

08:42.656 --> 08:46.493
UH, THE FUNNY PART IS
THAT IS WAS BRENDAN.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.995
( laughs )

08:48.028 --> 08:50.530
( laughs ) THAT IS FUNNY.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.232
HE'S A DEAD MAN.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.835
I MEAN BOYS BUY CONDOMS
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

08:54.868 --> 08:57.771
'CAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET
LUCKY, BUT I KNOW LENNOX AND...

08:57.805 --> 09:00.941
AND... AND I KNOW LENNOX.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.544
AND CLEARLY BRENDAN WANTS
TO GET TO KNOW LENNOX TOO.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.279
- DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GO THERE?
- I'M A GUY.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.750
I DON'T HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE.
THAT'S WHERE WE LIVE.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.985
- SO YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THIS AT ALL?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.987
NOT AT ALL AFTER THE TALKS
I'VE HAD WITH LENNOX.

09:14.021 --> 09:16.523
I MEAN, IF SHE WAS PLANNING ON DOING
SOMETHING TONIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.559
DID SHE BY ANY CHANCE MENTION
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.663
- ( phone beeps )
- OH, A TEXT FROM LENNOX

09:22.696 --> 09:24.531
TELLING ME WHAT SHE'S DOING.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.635
"BACK SOON. AT THE SALON.
GETTING WAXED."

09:30.704 --> 09:33.573
OKAY, SO LET'S JUST
RECAP, SHALL WE?

09:33.607 --> 09:35.308
THE BOY IS OUT BUYING CONDOMS

09:35.342 --> 09:37.878
AND THE GIRL JUST
FINISHED GETTING WAXED.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.880
SURE YOU'RE NOT
WORRIED ABOUT THIS?

09:39.913 --> 09:42.582
WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN THE SAME SENTENCE,
OF COURSE IT SOUNDS SUSPICIOUS.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.085
- HOW ELSE CAN YOU PUT IT?
- IT COULD MEAN ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.787
THIS THING YOU'RE
DOING RIGHT NOW,

09:46.820 --> 09:49.690
IS THIS PARTIAL DENIAL OR
IS IT JUST TOTAL DENIAL?

09:49.723 --> 09:51.759
TOTAL. WHEN I MAKE A
CHOICE I AM ALL IN.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.262
JOE, WHAT DO WE DO?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.997
I DON'T KNOW. WHY
ARE YOU ASKING ME?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.199
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO HAD ALL THESE
DEEP AMAZING CONVERSATIONS

09:59.232 --> 10:02.636
WITH LENNOX ABOUT BOYS AND GIRLS
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL-NIGHT PARTIES.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.872
LOOK, THERE MAY HAVE
BEEN SOME THINGS

10:04.905 --> 10:07.607
THAT I DIDN'T COVER IN
MY TALKS WITH LENNOX.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.043
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL
AT MY FIRST ALL-NIGHT PARTY

10:10.077 --> 10:13.346
I HAD S-E-X.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.583
DID YOU MENTION THAT TO LENNOX?

10:16.616 --> 10:19.619
NO, I DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, BRENDAN SEEMED SO SWEET.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.621
OF COURSE HE SEEMED SWEET.
I WAS SWEET AT THAT AGE.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.324
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO,
BE SWEET WHEN WE MEET THE PARENTS.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.259
SO YOU THINK HE'S
PRESSURING HER?

10:26.293 --> 10:29.763
LET'S SEE, A
HORMONAL TEENAGE BOY

10:29.797 --> 10:31.732
WITH A POCKETFUL OF CONDOMS...

10:31.765 --> 10:34.001
NAH, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY NOT.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.369
THE DANCE IS IN AN HOUR.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.672
I'VE GOT TO TALK TO LENNOX.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.708
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO ORGANIZE MY THOUGHTS,

10:40.741 --> 10:43.410
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY AND CONCISELY.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.083
AND SO YOU'RE HAVING
A GLASS OF WINE?

10:50.117 --> 10:53.053
WINE ORGANIZES ME.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.194
MM, HEY, HONEY. YOU'RE HOME.

11:01.228 --> 11:03.263
I'M RUNNING LATE, AUNT MEL.
I'VE GOT TO GET READY.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.965
NO NO NO, LET'S TALK.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.869
DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT
MY FIRST ALL-NIGHT PARTY?

11:08.902 --> 11:11.739
I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT, BUT
I DON'T HAVE ALL NIGHT.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.074
I ONLY BRING IT UP
BECAUSE, WELL, YOU KNOW,

11:14.107 --> 11:16.844
AT THESE KINDS OF
EVENTS THINGS HAPPEN

11:16.877 --> 11:19.379
WITH BOYS AND GIRLS

11:19.412 --> 11:21.348
AND CERTAIN PRESSURES.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.016
OH, I GOT IT.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.852
SEE, LOOK AT US COMMUNICATING.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.820
KEEPING IT REAL.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.421
SOMEBODY WILL BRING ALCOHOL.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.690
"HEY, LET'S GO FOR A RIDE."

11:30.724 --> 11:32.659
DON'T WORRY. I'M
NOT GOING TO DRINK

11:32.692 --> 11:34.327
AND MY FRIENDS AND I
ARE TAKING THE BUS.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.330
THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.
BUT, WELL OKAY.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.667
- BRENDAN SEEMS LIKE A SWEET GUY.
- OH, HE IS.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.369
- ( doorbell rings )
- DAMN! ALL RIGHT.

11:42.402 --> 11:44.738
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST STAY HERE.
MORE TO SAY.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.043
MEL, GUESS WHO
WANTED TO COME OVER?

11:50.077 --> 11:53.113
- DALE, PHIL.
- BURKE. NICE PLACE.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.848
THIS LOOKS LIKE A NO-SHOE HOUSE.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.917
NO NO NO NO. PLEASE
LEAVE THEM ON.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.954
UM, SO WHAT BRINGS
THE CITY CONTROLLER

12:00.988 --> 12:03.090
AND UNION BOSS TO MY
HOUSE SO UNINVITEDLY?

12:03.123 --> 12:04.457
PLEASE TELL ME IT'S JUST
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.894
YOU DON'T LET ME
USE THE BATHROOM.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.996
THE NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN

12:09.029 --> 12:10.831
AND THE ONLY PERSON
THEY'LL TALK TO IS YOU.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.465
OH MAN, BAD TIMING.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.168
- AUNT MEL, I'VE GOT TO GET DRESSED.
- DON'T LEAVE YET.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.905
YOU CAN STOP THE STRIKE, MEL.
YOU CAN BE A HERO.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.373
YOU COULD COME OUT OF THIS WITH
A DOG PARK NAMED AFTER YOU.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.844
ALL RIGHT. BOYS, LET'S TAKE
THIS INTO THE KITCHEN.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.180
BETTER GET MORE THAN A
DOG PARK OUT OF THIS.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.382
I THINK THAT'S WHY THE AUTHOR
HAS MILDRED DIE IN THE END,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.284
SO PHILLIP CAN FIND TRUE LOVE.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.788
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S GREAT.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.059
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN.
WHAT IF HOLLY SEES THAT?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.894
SHE'LL KNOW WE'RE WORKING
TOGETHER, WON'T SHE?

12:40.928 --> 12:43.897
NO, IT'S OKAY. I'LL TELL HER
I CAME UP WITH IT ON MY OWN.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.733
I'VE GOT THIS WHOLE THING
WITH HOLLY UNDER CONTROL.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.936
( gasps ) OH MY GOD, RYDER!

12:48.969 --> 12:51.004
ARE YOU TWO STUDYING?

12:51.038 --> 12:52.505
NO NO.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.541
NO, WE WERE MAKING OUT.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.279
YEAH, WITH OUR TONGUES
AND EVERYTHING.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.482
YOU WERE NOT. THESE
BOOKS ARE WARM.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.919
AND ARE THOSE NOTES?

13:05.953 --> 13:09.056
CHARLOTTE, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO MY BOYFRIEND IN PRIVATE.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
NO.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.929
NO, HOLLY, I'D LIKE TO
SPEAK WITH YOU IN PRIVATE.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.239
WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.441
ENGLISH LITERATURE
HAS GOTTEN INTO ME.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.111
I THOUGHT WE BOTH
AGREED SHE WAS OUT.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.480
NO, ONE OF US AGREED.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.849
CHARLOTTE IS REALLY
GOOD AT ENGLISH

13:35.883 --> 13:38.018
AND SHE CAN HELP BOTH OF
US ON THIS PRESENTATION.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.521
AND IF YOU WEREN'T SO
STUBBORN, YOU'D REALIZE THAT.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.357
ARE YOU STANDING UP TO ME?

13:44.391 --> 13:47.995
YES, MILDRED... HOLLY, I AM.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.433
WELL, FINE.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.969
I SUPPOSE YOUR GRADES
COULD BE BETTER.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.176
OH MY GOD, SHE BOUGHT IT.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.490
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:17.524 --> 14:20.527
IT'S A SEMIFORMAL
DANCE SO FORMAL...

14:20.560 --> 14:23.363
SEMI.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.532
WOW.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.301
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.237
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU NEED TO
LOOK THAT BEAUTIFUL THOUGH.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.073
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU PUT ON A PONCHO OR
A HOUSECOAT OVER THAT OR SOMETHING?

14:33.106 --> 14:35.242
- SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.010
I THINK YOUR AUNT MEL WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU BEFORE YOU LEFT.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.411
- WE TALKED ALREADY.
- YOU DID?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.213
YEAH YEAH, "LENNOX,
DID I EVER TELL YOU

14:40.247 --> 14:41.514
ABOUT MY FIRST ALL-NIGHT PARTY?

14:41.548 --> 14:45.085
BOYS AND GIRLS, RESIST
PRESSURE, BLAH BLAH BLAH."

14:45.118 --> 14:47.854
- SHE COVERED ALL THE BASES.
- OH, OKAY.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.557
GOOD THEN. WELL, HAVE A GREAT...

14:50.590 --> 14:53.927
SEMI GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.563
NOT TOO MEMORABLE.

14:58.631 --> 15:02.102
OKAY, SO WE MAINTAIN PENSIONS AT
LAST YEARS' LEVELS BUT NO ROLLBACKS.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.271
AND IT'S A JOINT PRESS
CONFERENCE SO NOBODY CAVED.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.505
IT'S WIN-WIN. ARE WE AGREED?

15:05.538 --> 15:06.974
- YES.
- OKAY.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.876
ALL RIGHT, THEN IF THERE
AREN'T ANY OTHER ISSUES...

15:09.909 --> 15:12.412
I WOULDN'T MIND THAT
LAST PIECE OF LASAGNA.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.613
I CALLED THAT!

15:13.646 --> 15:16.449
YOU SERIOUS? I'M
SITTING RIGHT HERE.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.987
ALL RIGHT, GUYS. LET'S SAY
YOU DO THIS TOGETHER.

15:20.020 --> 15:23.256
DALE, YOU CUT IT IN HALF.
PHIL, YOU PICK YOUR PIECE.

15:23.290 --> 15:27.327
YOU'RE AMAZING. YOU'RE THE
KING SOLOMON OF PASTA.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.229
STEPHANIE, THINK YOU CAN
HANDLE THE REST OF THIS?

15:29.262 --> 15:31.631
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME. I'VE DEALT
WITH THESE TYPES BEFORE.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.500
NO, I JUST MEANT RUN
THE DISHWASHER.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.003
THERE'S LIKE A MILLION
BUTTONS ON THAT THING.

15:36.036 --> 15:40.573
I'M STOMPING OUT FIRES LEFT AND RIGHT.
NEXT UP... LENNOX!

15:40.607 --> 15:41.908
SHE ALREADY LEFT FOR
THE DANCE, MEL.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.144
WHAT? BUT WE DIDN'T GET
TO FINISH OUR TALK.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.546
YEAH YOU DID. SHE SAID
YOU WENT ON FOREVER.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.215
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.418
I DID NOT. I BARELY GOT STARTED.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.121
WAIT A MINUTE. SO YOU DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HER ABOUT BRENDAN

15:54.154 --> 15:57.457
AND HIS LITTLE POCKETFUL OF FUN?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.392
NO, AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.029
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T GO TO THE DANCE
OR THE PARTY AND EMBARRASS HER.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.131
THAT'S SOMETHING A MOM WOULD DO.
SHE'D HATE ME FOREVER,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.199
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.501
- I'LL GO.
- WHOA WHOA, JOE.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.203
- WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.439
TAKE HIM SHOE SHOPPING.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.407
JOE, COME HERE. SIT DOWN.

16:14.441 --> 16:18.411
ALL RIGHT, WHEN YOU TELL A
TEENAGER NOT TO DO SOMETHING

16:18.445 --> 16:21.681
SHE DOES THE OPPOSITE,
OFTEN ON HER PARENTS' BED.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.983
AND THEN AGAIN IN
THE POOL HOUSE.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.619
I'M JUST GUESSING.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.721
IS THAT YOUR PLAN? JUST SIT
HERE AND DO NOTHING THEN?

16:28.755 --> 16:33.026
NO. SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING
UNTIL WE THINK OF SOMETHING.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.562
WHERE'S MY GLASS?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.498
( music playing )

16:40.500 --> 16:42.402
HEY, PSST.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.539
IS THIS TARA GLAZER'S HOUSE?
IS THAT THE ALL-NIGHT PARTY?

16:46.573 --> 16:50.377
- ARE YOU THE COPS?
- NO, I'M NOT THE COPS.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.979
YEAH, THAT'S THE HOUSE.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.583
COPS ARE BOUND BY WIMPY
ANTI-TORTURE LAWS.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.687
AND NOW WE WAIT.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.702
HI.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.670
YOU KNOW WHAT EVERYONE
IN THERE IS SAYING?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.772
"YOUR NANNY IS OUTSIDE.
DID HE BRING YOUR BINKY?"

17:19.806 --> 17:22.109
- JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- NOTHING.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.010
JUST MAKING SURE THAT BRENDAN
KNOWS THAT I'M OUT HERE.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.345
YOU KNOW, AN ARM'S LENGTH AWAY.

17:25.378 --> 17:29.449
OR IN HIS CASE, MAYBE A
BROKEN ARM'S LENGTH AWAY.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.284
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GOING ON HERE?

17:31.318 --> 17:34.387
LOOK, EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON
SEVERAL EYEWITNESSES

17:34.421 --> 17:37.324
SAW BRENDAN IN THE DRUGSTORE
MAKING AN ADULT PURCHASE.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.526
Boy: HEY, LENNOX, IS IT NAPTIME?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.430
CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THIS IN THE CAR?

17:43.463 --> 17:45.598
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.343
YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE MORE TO SAY,

17:56.376 --> 17:59.045
SO LET'S HEAR THE BIG LONG SPEECH
SO WE CAN GET ON WITH OUR LIVES.

17:59.078 --> 18:02.349
OKAY, DON'T HAVE SEX.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.351
YOU GONNA GET TO THE POINT?

18:04.384 --> 18:06.253
I'M JUST TRYING TO LOOK
OUT FOR YOU HERE, OKAY?

18:06.286 --> 18:07.654
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT BRENDAN IS.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.257
YOU SEE, US GUYS,

18:10.290 --> 18:13.226
WE JUST GO, LIKE, ON IMPULSE. YOU
KNOW, WE JUST GET A THOUGHT,

18:13.260 --> 18:15.462
WE PLOW RIGHT THROUGH WITHOUT
EVEN THINKING ABOUT THINGS.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.530
YOU MEAN LIKE YOU
SHOWING UP HERE?

18:17.564 --> 18:20.333
I'M A GROWN-UP. I
DON'T NEED TO THINK.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.737
JOE, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

18:24.771 --> 18:28.441
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED
AND A LITTLE WORRIED.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.411
ABOUT WHAT? NOTHING WAS
GONNA HAPPEN TONIGHT.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.813
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- BECAUSE I DECIDED.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.417
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT BRENDAN
WANTS; IT'S ABOUT WHAT I WANT.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.619
GIRLS HAVE THAT POWER, YOU KNOW.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.588
WOW. I MEAN, I ALWAYS
KNEW THAT THEY DID.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.356
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU KNEW THAT.

18:43.390 --> 18:45.458
ALTHOUGH I'M HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT YOU DO.

18:45.492 --> 18:49.229
LOOK, BRENDAN'S A NICE KID,
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S A BOY.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.831
- HE CAN BE MANAGED.
- MANAGED?

18:51.864 --> 18:54.667
- I LIKE THAT.
- ( laughs )

18:54.701 --> 18:58.305
YOU KNOW, YOUR AUNT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
DONE A LOT BETTER JOB AT THIS THAN I'M DOING.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.241
IN FACT, SHE WOULD KILL ME IF
SHE KNEW I WAS HERE RIGHT NOW.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.710
SHE JUST DOESN'T WANT
YOU TO HATE HER.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.678
SO IT'S BETTER IF I HATE YOU?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.448
BETTER FOR EVERYBODY, YEAH.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.585
GO ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR NIGHT.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.324
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.459
THE LECTURE.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.295
MY DAD'S NOT AROUND TO
ANNOY ME WITH THAT STUFF.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.465
I'M HAPPY TO.

19:28.401 --> 19:32.405
BY THE WAY, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.408
THANKS. I GOT MY EYEBROWS WAXED.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.511
EYEBROWS! OF COURSE.

19:38.545 --> 19:41.448
THANK GOD.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.716
OH, THAT WAS AWESOME.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.319
I WAS RIGHT ABOUT
LENNOX ALL ALONG.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.356
YOU KNOW, OPEN AND HONEST IS
REALLY THE WAY TO GO WITH KIDS.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.359
YEAH, SAYS THE WOMAN HIDING UNDERNEATH
THE BLANKET FROM HER NIECE.

19:52.392 --> 19:55.462
THE ONLY REASON I CAME ALONG WAS
TO MAKE SURE YOU DIDN'T GO NUTS.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.364
QUICK, SHE'S COMING BACK!

19:57.397 --> 19:59.766
- HEY, JOE.
- YEAH?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.669
I JUST WANT YOU TO TELL AUNT MEL
THAT MY OUTFIT WAS A HUGE HIT

20:02.702 --> 20:04.337
AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB
WITH THE LIPSTICK.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.473
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU SEE HER.
- I'LL TELL HER.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.441
NIGHT. BE SAFE.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.680
WE'RE ALL CLEAR.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.682
- DOES SHE KNOW?
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.384
I THINK SHE DID.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.920
I MEAN, "IF YOU SEE AUNT MEL"?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:20.953 --> 20:22.789
GET DOWN, SHE'S COMING BACK!

20:22.822 --> 20:25.358
PSYCH.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.394
YOU'RE SO EASY.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.396
Mel: GET ME HOME.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.344
( groans ) DO WE
HAVE ANY ASPIRIN

20:44.377 --> 20:46.413
OR MORPHINE OR SOMETHING?

20:46.446 --> 20:49.616
MY BACK IS KILLING ME FROM BEING ALL
SCRUNCHED UP HIDING IN THE BACK SEAT.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.484
I THOUGHT A WOMAN OF
YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE

20:51.518 --> 20:54.487
WOULD BE USED TO THE RIGORS
OF BACKSEAT GYMNASTICS.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.523
YEAH, WELL, IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.591
