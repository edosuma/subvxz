then I fear

11:57.342 --> 11:59.094
our line is truly at an end.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.762
But they knew so much already.

12:00.846 --> 12:04.850
I couldn't toast a piece of bread
with the heat they were putting on you.

you learn before leaving this place,

12:18.363 --> 12:22.409
it's that we,
even the weakest among us,

12:23.368 --> 12:24.870
are better than the best of them.
