WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.771
Previously on "Chance"...

00:03.871 --> 00:06.507
Winter admitted that his
coping mechanism is killing.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.209
He never actually said
a number.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.278
He did name one, though --
Catherine.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.580
I've got this friend
Frank at the D.A.'s office

00:12.680 --> 00:14.382
who doesn't
completely hate me yet --

00:14.482 --> 00:15.583
I c-- I can ask him.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.584
Katherine Atkins.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.718
I'd like to know
how she died.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.888
And also, whether there were,
uh, rocks in her throat.

00:20.988 --> 00:21.889
The first guy you picked.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.024
The drug dealer.
CHANCE: Spangler.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.426
Put his mom in the ICU.
Yeah.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.928
I told you that is not the type
of guy who's gonna be persuaded.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.097
I found Wade Pardo.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.065
He was working in Daly City,
at a garage,

00:31.165 --> 00:33.534
and then somebody showed up
and threw him a beatdown.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.203
CHANCE: Same thing
happened to Matty Willis.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.071
Those who live by the sword,
die by the sword.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.872
Don't you ever wonder?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.741
Why I would throw away
a 30-year career

00:40.841 --> 00:42.376
and let my life go
to shit over your boss?

00:42.476 --> 00:45.213
Come meet me right now and I'll
tell you what you don't know.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.548
Aah!
Pepper's parents
are pressing charges.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.250
We'll figure this out.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.651
There's a path here, Ryan.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.053
A path to becoming whole.
What do I do?

00:53.154 --> 00:54.622
You just walk into
a police station.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.290
LAMBERT: Ryan Winter.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.925
He was asking for somebody
to come out to his house.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.727
He just said that he needed
to talk to somebody.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.662
About the things
that he's done.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.063
You deserve
to be there, man.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.399
Where's Frank?
He's right there.

01:05.499 --> 01:15.443
**

01:15.543 --> 01:25.453
**

01:25.553 --> 01:34.962
**

01:35.062 --> 01:40.968
**

01:41.068 --> 01:45.539
**

01:45.639 --> 01:55.483
**

01:55.583 --> 01:57.151
**

01:57.251 --> 02:00.721
(panting)

02:00.821 --> 02:10.298
**

02:10.398 --> 02:20.508
**

02:20.608 --> 02:22.910
Frank, no, don't!

02:23.010 --> 02:25.045
Probably should've thought
about "Frank, no, don't"

02:25.145 --> 02:26.414
before this, huh?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.249
Like before you started
yapping your mouth

02:28.349 --> 02:29.483
about how
that bike's not mine

02:29.583 --> 02:31.919
and I just can't go
taking people's shit,

02:32.019 --> 02:34.588
like you're the fucking
policeman of the world!

02:34.688 --> 02:36.089
Stop it!
Fuck!

02:36.190 --> 02:39.860
**

02:39.960 --> 02:41.762
Hey, Matthew.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.198
What'd he do?

02:44.298 --> 02:47.601
Saw me take
Chris Anton's bike.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.203
Said he was gonna tell
the cops.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.372
Now he's for sure gonna tell
the cops. Aren't you, Stevie?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.507
Stop it! Help!

02:53.607 --> 02:55.743
Please, anybody!

02:55.843 --> 02:58.346
(laughs)
Please help me!

02:58.446 --> 03:00.881
Anybody, please!
(sobs)

03:00.981 --> 03:02.750
Please help me!

03:02.850 --> 03:04.452
Help!

03:04.552 --> 03:06.220
(gasping)

03:06.320 --> 03:07.355
Aah!

03:07.455 --> 03:08.422
Aah!

03:08.522 --> 03:10.691
(choking)

03:10.791 --> 03:13.794
**

03:13.894 --> 03:15.363
(choking stops)

03:15.463 --> 03:24.638
**

03:24.738 --> 03:28.742
LAMBERT: "I was in bed,
but I wasn't asleep."

03:28.842 --> 03:30.143
Ryan.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.416
I was i--

03:35.516 --> 03:36.750
(sighs)

03:36.850 --> 03:39.887
I was in bed,
but I wasn't asleep.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.490
"I heard something
out in the hallway.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.157
Footsteps."

03:44.258 --> 03:45.893
(breathes deeply)

03:45.993 --> 03:47.828
I heard footsteps
in the hall.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.932
"Not Lyndsay's.
I know what hers sound like.

03:52.032 --> 03:55.135
So I got worried.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.339
I got up,
I went out there."

04:01.275 --> 04:03.344
I knew it wasn't Lyndsay.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.178
So I got my gun.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.615
No. Hey.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.918
Don't skate over this, buddy,
okay?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.687
Please.
Please take this seriously.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.788
Now, we are so close

04:14.888 --> 04:16.156
to being done
with this guy.

04:16.256 --> 04:19.760
And he just made it so easy
for us.

04:19.860 --> 04:24.365
The only person who can fuck
this up right now is you.

04:24.465 --> 04:28.268
**

04:28.369 --> 04:31.605
(beeping)
WOMAN: Garage door open.

04:31.705 --> 04:38.111
**

04:38.211 --> 04:41.782
(engine shuts off)

04:41.882 --> 04:44.318
(beeping)

04:46.954 --> 04:48.356
(beeping stops)

04:48.456 --> 04:54.127
**

04:54.227 --> 04:56.296
(door closes)

04:56.397 --> 04:58.566
**

04:58.666 --> 05:00.401
Ryan, I --

05:00.501 --> 05:02.536
I've been driving around
for hours.

05:02.636 --> 05:06.407
Um, we need to talk.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.208
About things I...

05:08.308 --> 05:09.643
Some things I...

05:09.743 --> 05:11.579
Some things that I...

05:11.679 --> 05:13.046
We have...

05:15.649 --> 05:17.918
(crying)
I'm so sorry.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.188
Hey, hey.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.023
I'm so sorry.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.492
Ryan.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.759
Mm-hmm.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.428
Did you hurt --

05:27.528 --> 05:29.229
(footstep)

05:29.329 --> 05:30.898
Is someone there?

05:30.998 --> 05:35.369
**

05:35.469 --> 05:37.170
Who is that?

05:39.272 --> 05:40.874
(gasps) Oh!

05:40.974 --> 05:50.518
**

05:50.618 --> 05:54.021
(sighs)

05:57.725 --> 05:59.359
This doesn't hurt us.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.961
We just need to rethink it.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.897
We need to rethink it,
nail it down, call it in.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.966
But we can't wait too long.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.869
So, here's what happened.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.573
Your faithful assistant,
she tried to defend you,

06:12.673 --> 06:15.275
and Hynes killed her.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.044
You ran to her,

06:17.144 --> 06:20.648
and you -- you thought,
you know, maybe there was time.

06:20.748 --> 06:24.918
So her blood --
Her blood on you makes sense.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.287
Okay.
Go back to the beginning.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.989
Let's go.

06:29.089 --> 06:33.661
I was in bed,
but I wasn't asleep.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.564
I heard something
in the hall.

06:36.664 --> 06:38.298
Lyndsay's voice.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.968
She was shouting something.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.338
Then it just...cut off.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.175
Good.
I got scared.

06:48.275 --> 06:52.780
I got up,
and I went out there.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.847
Again.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.583
(indistinct conversations)

06:55.683 --> 06:57.284
(buzzer, door opens)

06:57.384 --> 07:02.122
**

07:02.222 --> 07:04.758
(lock disengages)

07:04.858 --> 07:06.760
(indistinct conversations)

07:11.499 --> 07:12.700
WOMAN: Thank you.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.868
(door closes, lock engages)

07:33.521 --> 07:34.454
Hey.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.223
I'm Kym.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.059
Nicole.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.629
Why're you here, Nicole?

07:41.729 --> 07:44.197
What'd you do?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.366
Broke a girl's nose
at school.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.201
Why?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.638
Just mean-girl shit.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.741
A girl I thought was my friend
did something to me.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.643
Spread rumors about me.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.011
So you broke her nose?

07:58.111 --> 08:00.413
Cool.
How?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.086
With a book.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.521
You hit her with a book?

08:07.621 --> 08:08.556
Shit.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.991
A big book?

08:11.091 --> 08:14.595
Yep.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.197
Well, there aren't
any books here, Nicole.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.933
So you won't be pulling any
more stupid shit like that.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.270
Probably not.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.373
Definitely not.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.508
-(laughing) Hey.
-Oh!

08:28.609 --> 08:29.610
Say it.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.346
Say it!

08:36.049 --> 08:39.953
(young women gasp, laugh)

08:40.053 --> 08:41.622
YOUNG WOMAN: Now what?

08:41.722 --> 08:44.558
(indistinct shouting)

08:44.658 --> 08:45.793
YOUNG WOMAN #2:
Come on!

08:45.893 --> 08:48.295
**

08:48.395 --> 08:49.930
Come here!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.565
GUARD:
You stay back!

08:51.665 --> 08:53.100
Don't do any more.
Get back!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.541
What?
You tell me.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.376
Tell you what?

09:03.476 --> 09:05.245
There's something going on.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.048
Something like what?
You want me
to come over there?

09:08.148 --> 09:10.317
You just keep it
the fuck up.

09:16.590 --> 09:18.158
You hurry out of here
with the bags hanging off you

09:18.258 --> 09:19.993
'cause your daddy found you.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.162
And now you're back here
like nothing even ever happened.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.563
You're gonna tell me.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.101
Did you kill him?

09:28.201 --> 09:31.171
Is he dead?

09:31.271 --> 09:33.440
(sighs)

09:33.540 --> 09:36.744
You know,
I don't care if he is --

09:36.844 --> 09:39.012
He's not.
Why not?

09:39.112 --> 09:40.981
Because we talked
and came to an agreement.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.516
He leaves me alone forever,
he stays alive.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.986
Oh!

09:46.086 --> 09:48.188
And you trust him
to honor that?

09:51.992 --> 09:54.327
Should I conclude from that

09:54.427 --> 09:58.666
there's been a shift
in your view of the world?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.333
I wouldn't.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.047
Something happened.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.348
At the house.

10:15.448 --> 10:20.487
Something fucking bad
happened at Winter's house!

10:20.587 --> 10:23.556
Every time I feel like
I know where I am with things,

10:23.657 --> 10:27.027
I'm wrong.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.030
One thing I know for sure
is that I fucked up somewhere.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
Obviously
I fucked Nicole up.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.301
(ringtone plays)
Before I even realized that
fucking her up was a thing,

10:34.401 --> 10:35.703
I'd probably
already done it.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.705
(ringtone continues)
Really?

10:37.805 --> 10:41.308
'Cause being here for this
isn't enough to shut it off?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.710
I'm sorry.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.049
You didn't fuck her up.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.818
Yeah, right.

10:50.918 --> 10:52.419
We did.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.822
No, we didn't.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.223
I did.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.828
What does that mean?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.098
She gets it from me.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.904
Everything she's done
in the last year...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.906
everything
that's happened to her...

11:16.443 --> 11:19.579
...I, uh --
I passed it to her.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.750
It's filtered
through her.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.785
Right.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.386
'Cause you stalk people.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.890
You're a stalker and...

11:29.990 --> 11:31.624
Yeah, I am.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.528
I did.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.731
I was not much older
than Nicole is now.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.302
(chuckles)

11:42.402 --> 11:43.937
It was a patient.
An ER patient...

11:44.037 --> 11:47.207
(laughs) Stop it.
...at Mass General.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.142
I was their resident,
and we dated.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.610
(laughing)

11:50.710 --> 11:52.913
Come on.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.448
And when she broke up with me,
I stalked her.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.317
(laughs)

12:00.387 --> 12:02.555
I was arrested.
(laughs)

12:02.655 --> 12:05.592
I was hospitalized.

12:05.692 --> 12:08.161
And I attempted suicide.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.835
It's not a joke.

12:21.441 --> 12:25.612
You're telling me this now
and...

12:25.712 --> 12:28.481
Have you told Nicole?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.150
Yeah.
When?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.453
And she knows,
and I didn't?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.423
Did -- Did you even think
of telling me first?

12:36.523 --> 12:41.461
Did you even think
of telling me when we met?!

12:41.561 --> 12:43.496
When we were dating?!

12:43.596 --> 12:46.699
When I maybe would have
wanted to have a say...
I --

12:46.800 --> 12:49.302
...for my own
decision-making process?!

12:49.402 --> 12:51.438
I was..

12:51.538 --> 12:53.273
I was afraid
of how you would react.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.641
I didn't want
to drive you away.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.043
You think?!

12:59.980 --> 13:02.015
I know this is
a lot to take in.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.450
But this is --
This is fixable.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.885
We can fix this.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.486
(door opens)

13:06.586 --> 13:07.787
DONNA: Hi, guys.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.057
Sorry.
Come on in.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.131
DONNA: So, there has been
a new twist.

13:18.231 --> 13:22.069
The prosecution's now asking
for six months to a year

13:22.169 --> 13:23.636
in juvenile detention.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.973
-What?
-A year? Wh--

13:26.073 --> 13:29.376
No!
What about the --
the mitigating factors?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.811
The social-media stuff?
Yeah, I said that.

13:31.912 --> 13:35.048
There as an incident in holding
with Nicole last night.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.020
Oh, my God!

13:40.120 --> 13:41.421
What the hell happened?
Oh!

13:41.521 --> 13:44.724
It's okay.
I'm okay.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.694
So, she gets beaten up in jail,
and it's a strike against her?

13:47.794 --> 13:50.563
Taken together
with the assault charge,

13:50.663 --> 13:52.432
this looks like it speaks
to a pattern of behavior.

13:52.532 --> 13:56.870
So, they are offering
an open plea deal.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.005
What does that mean?

13:58.105 --> 13:59.873
She pleads guilty.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.443
Then the state will forget
the fight in detention,

14:03.543 --> 14:05.845
take into consideration all
of your recent volunteer work,

14:05.946 --> 14:08.448
and hand your case
directly to a judge.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.850
Is that a good thing?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.352
She's seen
to be cooperating.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.354
It also makes it easier
for the prosecution.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.555
Takes the case
out of their busy hands.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.790
I want to take it.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.559
The deal.
I want to do it.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.693
-Hey.
-Please.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.761
(door opens)

14:22.896 --> 14:24.631
MAN: All rise for the Honorable
Judge Ronald Stavian.

14:24.731 --> 14:25.732
Come.

14:25.832 --> 14:30.570
**

14:30.670 --> 14:33.206
(clears throat)
Please be seated.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.210
**

14:37.310 --> 14:41.314
I understand the prosecution
has offered an open plea deal.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.450
How does the defendant
feel about that?

14:43.550 --> 14:51.291
**

14:51.391 --> 14:55.162
The defendant has decided
to accept it, Your Honor.

14:55.262 --> 14:58.298
Great. Back for a sentencing
hearing in two days.

14:58.398 --> 15:02.402
(gavel bangs,
cellphone buzzes)

15:02.502 --> 15:03.836
Lorena got to work,

15:03.937 --> 15:06.006
and there were cops
all over Winter's place.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.640
Plus a coroner's van.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.510
She saw him wheeling out
two body bags.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.247
And she doesn't know
who was in them?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.583
She didn't think
it was the best idea

15:16.683 --> 15:18.585
to start asking cops
a lot of questions.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.287
Being illegal and all.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.588
Where is she now?

15:21.688 --> 15:23.991
I sent her home.
Told her to sit tight.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.026
Said I'd call
if we found out anything.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.961
Jesus.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.999
I'll call Hynes.
See if he knows anything.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.001
Somebody better
know something.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.202
(dialing)

15:35.302 --> 15:37.270
(ringing)

15:38.438 --> 15:41.108
MAN: Hey.
Who's this?

15:41.208 --> 15:45.979
Eldon.
A friend of Kevin's.

15:46.079 --> 15:50.017
Is he there?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.853
This your cell
you're calling from, Eldon?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.622
Yeah.

15:55.722 --> 15:59.192
How well
do you know Kevin?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.361
Well enough to know that
he's a homicide detective,

16:01.461 --> 16:05.365
recently retired, and would
not let anyone use his phone.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.201
When was the last time
you talked to him?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.637
I --
Uh...yesterday.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.675
Is he okay?

16:15.775 --> 16:20.547
This is Detective Solis,
Eldon. SFPD.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.016
And I have some bad news
for you.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.085
**

16:31.191 --> 16:33.493
**

16:33.593 --> 16:37.330
I feel like we don't eat
as well as we should.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.100
Maybe.
I don't know.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.037
Feels like
if we put good stuff in,

16:44.137 --> 16:46.106
we'd feel better.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.241
No, for sure.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.676
If I ate
more organic food,

16:49.776 --> 16:52.779
no way
I would've assaulted Pepper.

16:52.879 --> 16:56.116
Honey...
Can we just not analyze me
right now?

16:56.216 --> 17:00.220
**

17:00.320 --> 17:03.090
I think you need to give me
a bit of a break. All right?

17:03.190 --> 17:06.859
A -- A mother never wants
to feel the way I feel.

17:06.959 --> 17:07.960
Which is helpless.

17:08.061 --> 17:09.862
I-I don't know what to do.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.964
Well, you've always
been helpless.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.966
**

17:14.067 --> 17:16.136
You know, this isn't
actually about me.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.071
You did something awful.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.472
No, what I did was dumb.

17:19.572 --> 17:20.907
But I stood up
for myself.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.409
When have you ever
stood up for yourself?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.311
Hey!

17:24.411 --> 17:26.479
That's not fair.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.648
Life isn't fair.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.782
Yeah.

17:29.882 --> 17:36.589
**

17:36.689 --> 17:39.626
DAVENY: Over the past several
years, Detective Hynes has waged

17:39.726 --> 17:42.729
a consistent campaign
of harassment and stalking.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.466
My client made multiple official
complaints against him --

17:46.566 --> 17:48.268
one just recently,
which resulted

17:48.368 --> 17:50.803
in Hynes being asked
to leave the job.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.772
I talked to Hynes' supervisor
in Fremont.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.007
She confirmed that.
Yeah.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.809
D.A.'s office was
also informed of that complaint

17:56.909 --> 18:00.247
at the time
of Hynes' "retirement."

18:00.347 --> 18:02.682
Hynes underwent mandated
psychological evaluation

18:02.782 --> 18:05.017
three years ago
off this issue.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.587
So I hope the SFPD
has a good explanation

18:07.687 --> 18:10.190
as to
why he wasn't let go then.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.192
(breathes deeply)

18:12.292 --> 18:16.629
(sighs) Look, not
a whole lot to debate here.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.030
I spoke to my boss.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.032
And given
what we've been discussing,

18:20.133 --> 18:22.202
she's not
particularly inclined

18:22.302 --> 18:23.470
to bring charges
against Mr. Winter.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.338
And we're gonna take our lead
from them, so...

18:25.438 --> 18:26.639
Glad to hear it.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.842
Now, if you can keep
the press out of this,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.711
maybe my client can see
his way clear to forgetting

18:31.811 --> 18:35.848
how mishandled all this was
pretty much from the jump.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.350
Absolutely.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.018
Let's go, Ryan.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.222
We'll need your house for
another 24 hours, Mr. Winter.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.224
If you don't have somewhere else
to spend the night,

18:44.324 --> 18:46.159
we can try to --
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.327
But thank you.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.829
I just want to say,
Mr. Winter,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.898
how sorry I am
for all of this.

18:51.998 --> 19:00.873
**

19:00.973 --> 19:03.876
(cellphone rings)

19:03.976 --> 19:06.846
**

19:06.946 --> 19:09.316
What?!
LAMBERT: Hey, pal.

19:09.416 --> 19:12.252
Told you we'd be okay.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.854
Didn't I tell you?
Yes, you told me.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.357
Well, now I'm gonna tell
you something else, pal --

19:17.457 --> 19:21.761
No more talking to Dr. Chance,
do you hear me?

19:21.861 --> 19:24.731
I said, "Don't do it,"
and you did it anyway.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.666
And maybe it was fun for you
while it lasted,

19:26.766 --> 19:27.900
but that is over.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.536
Do you hear me?

19:29.636 --> 19:32.339
I hear you!

19:32.439 --> 19:38.445
**

19:38.545 --> 19:41.214
(indistinct conversations)

19:41.314 --> 19:42.715
(camera shutter clicks)

19:47.354 --> 19:50.257
Hey. (laughs)

19:50.357 --> 19:51.958
Surprise!

19:52.058 --> 19:55.094
Guys, can I --
Can I steal him for a minute?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.196
Thank you guys so much.
Come on!

19:57.297 --> 20:00.132
(laughing) Hey!
Frank.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.401
You recognize?
(laughs)

20:01.501 --> 20:02.435
What are you --
What are you...

20:02.535 --> 20:03.936
Come here!
Bring it in.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.573
My God!
It's been so long.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.707
Did you watch
that whole thing?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.208
Yeah, I did.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.943
I can't even program
my own fucking remote,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.111
and look at you.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.080
You're --
You're like a wizard.

20:14.180 --> 20:18.251
Seriously, Matty,
this is impressive.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.652
Oh, sorry.
I know.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.389
I know it's, not, uh --
not Matty Debbs anymore.

20:22.489 --> 20:27.093
It's...Ryan Winter, right?

20:27.193 --> 20:29.061
How did you find me?

20:29.161 --> 20:32.064
I-I work for the D.A.'s office
here, believe it or not.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.566
And, also...

20:33.666 --> 20:38.638
you haven't changed
as much as you think.

20:40.973 --> 20:44.143
Ah, come here, come here.
come here, come here.
Yeah. Absolutely.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.145
Um...
What?

20:47.314 --> 20:51.584
Okay, then why?
Why did you find me?

20:51.684 --> 20:54.120
Do you want some money?
No. Hell, come on.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.288
Matty, please.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.423
Well, I'm...
Don't insult me.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.757
...not trying
to insult you.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.191
I'm just wondering
what you're doing here.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.960
I just came to tell you
something, okay?

21:01.060 --> 21:04.263
Something that
a couple detectives,

21:04.364 --> 21:07.434
they came into my office
a few days ago and told me.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.168
It's about a woman.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.505
She was found dead
up near Stinson, all right?

21:12.605 --> 21:13.940
Mother of three.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.444
Her throat
was slashed wide open.

21:17.544 --> 21:22.549
And somebody had crammed
a bunch of rocks down inside.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.354
Yeah.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.022
Now, I know
it's sentimental, probably.

21:30.122 --> 21:34.193
The rocks.
And -- And I get it.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.462
But...

21:35.562 --> 21:38.565
it's too specific.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.167
You know?
It's too idiosyncratic.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.303
And it is too easy
to identify.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.838
You understand?

21:45.938 --> 21:51.378
So you can't use them
anymore, okay?

21:51.478 --> 21:55.515
Not unless getting caught
is what you want.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.384
But if it's not...

21:57.484 --> 22:01.320
then you and I should talk.

22:01.421 --> 22:05.892
**

22:05.992 --> 22:08.094
KIRSTEN: Thank you,
Mr. Spangler, for coming in.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.596
I'll be honest.

22:09.696 --> 22:14.434
It was pretty weird
to hear from you.

22:14.534 --> 22:15.768
Why?

22:15.868 --> 22:17.870
Because your mother
was my patient?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.772
Yeah.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.941
I just hope you know there's
been a lot of fucking water

22:22.041 --> 22:23.576
under the bridge since then.

22:23.676 --> 22:27.847
After what happened to me,
I got clean, I found clarity.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.116
I'm not that guy anymore
who could do that to her.

22:30.216 --> 22:31.884
I'm glad, Mr. Spangler.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.753
But that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.221
The attack.

22:35.321 --> 22:36.589
You filed a police report?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.758
Sure.
But they didn't do anything.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.127
What did the man look like?
Big.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.895
6 foot, 300 and change.

22:42.995 --> 22:45.264
Bald,
tattoo behind one ear.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.099
Beastmaster of a guy.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.435
Had you ever seen him before?

22:48.535 --> 22:50.937
No. I thought
he was gonna rob me.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.372
But then he starts talking
about my mother --

22:53.473 --> 22:56.242
how I-I beat
the shit out of her

22:56.342 --> 22:58.545
to -- to make her sign
the house over to me.

22:58.645 --> 23:01.047
"How did he even know about
her?" is my first thought.

23:01.147 --> 23:03.783
But then I got too busy
trying to defend myself.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.986
I deserved what he gave me.
I know that now.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.821
I don't want to thank him
or anything.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.591
But I do think
about things a lot.

23:11.691 --> 23:21.601
**

23:21.701 --> 23:23.436
**

23:23.536 --> 23:24.937
(car alarm chirps)

23:25.037 --> 23:26.673
**

23:26.773 --> 23:28.741
Dr. Chance.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.579
I called.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.247
Lucy said you were
expected in by 11:00.

23:35.347 --> 23:39.519
**

23:39.619 --> 23:43.022
What's going on, Ryan?

23:43.122 --> 23:46.192
You look very upset.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.529
Um...
(breathes deeply)

23:49.629 --> 23:53.866
What we had talked about,
what I was going to, um...

23:55.968 --> 23:57.670
I won't be able to now.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.607
To -- To turn myself in.
For what I...

24:02.809 --> 24:05.978
I'm really sorry.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.547
Why?

24:07.647 --> 24:08.948
What happened?

24:09.048 --> 24:11.651
That cop, the detective --
Hynes --

24:11.751 --> 24:13.185
He, um...

24:13.285 --> 24:16.523
He broke into my house.
Lyndsay tried to stop him.

24:16.623 --> 24:17.957
I (sighs)

24:18.057 --> 24:21.160
I was in bed,
but I wasn't asleep.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.394
I heard something
out in the hall.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.831
She tried to defend me,
and he...

24:24.931 --> 24:27.199
he killed her.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.502
Hynes killed her,
and then he attacked me.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.903
Came over to me.
I didn't know what to do.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.171
I tried to fight him off.
Why are you here?

24:32.271 --> 24:34.140
So I shot him.
Why are you here?

24:34.240 --> 24:36.042
What do you mean?
What are you doing here?

24:36.142 --> 24:37.744
What do you mean?
I just want to talk to you.
You shot him?

24:37.844 --> 24:39.311
I had to!
You shot him?!

24:39.411 --> 24:40.847
He came after me. You don't
understand what happened.

24:40.947 --> 24:45.151
The last time we talked,
you were ready to confess.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.485
You said
you were going to.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.854
You seem very...
You were gonna leave.

24:47.954 --> 24:48.855
You were gonna set
your life in order.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.823
Then you come here
and tell me this?

24:50.923 --> 24:52.992
You seem --
What happened
between then and now?

24:53.092 --> 24:55.562
You seem very angry.
Please don't be angry with me.
I am angry!

24:55.662 --> 24:57.196
'Cause you're lying to me!
Please. I'm not lying to you.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.397
Don't lie to me!

24:58.497 --> 25:00.667
What was Hynes
doing at your house?

25:00.767 --> 25:02.201
Huh?

25:02.301 --> 25:04.003
What was he doing there?

25:04.103 --> 25:08.340
**

25:08.440 --> 25:12.211
You said I could be whole,
but how can that happen now?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.613
I can't get there.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.247
Look what I did.
I killed a cop.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.749
He's one of them.
They're gonna make me burn.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.251
Bullshit! Liar!
You don't underst--

25:19.351 --> 25:22.889
**

25:22.989 --> 25:24.390
(coughs)
(elevator bell dings)

25:24.490 --> 25:26.593
(elevator door opens,
indistinct conversation)

25:26.693 --> 25:28.895
**

25:28.995 --> 25:31.564
(breathing heavily)

25:31.664 --> 25:35.301
**

25:35.401 --> 25:38.070
I wanted to
more than anything!

25:40.039 --> 25:42.274
Not for me.
For you.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.476
You're the one I trust.
But I can't.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.746
I just can't.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.582
**

25:49.682 --> 25:50.617
I can't.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.652
(sighs)

25:52.752 --> 25:55.287
**

25:59.225 --> 26:00.960
D:
How bad you hurt him?

26:01.060 --> 26:03.562
Not bad enough.

26:03.663 --> 26:06.132
You think
he'll tell the cops?

26:06.232 --> 26:08.901
If I had to bet,
I'd say no.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.569
Oh, and it was
kind of strange.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.840
He actually --
He apologized to me.

26:13.940 --> 26:15.274
And I think he meant it.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.144
Did he fucking apologize
for killing Hynes?!

26:18.244 --> 26:19.345
No, he -- No.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.113
He will.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.015
And then he'll be done.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.784
Look, Hynes...

26:24.884 --> 26:29.021
Hynes wanted everyone to know
what Winter does -- what he did.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.490
And he wanted Winter
to be alive to tell them.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.426
We owe it to Hynes
to do it the way he wanted.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.262
If we can.
So, then what?

26:36.362 --> 26:37.764
What the fuck
are we doing?

26:37.864 --> 26:39.666
Tell me
we're doing something.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.000
Yeah, we are.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.534
We will.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.104
I have an idea.
A Hail Mary pass.

26:45.204 --> 26:49.642
In the meantime, I need you
to do something for me.

26:49.742 --> 26:52.011
You know the girl
that Nicole hit?

26:52.111 --> 26:54.280
She pressed charges.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.883
Nic could go to
juvenile detention for a year.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.551
If it happens,
it's gonna happen tomorrow.

26:59.652 --> 27:01.387
That's not good.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.454
Wish I could help.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.724
(sighs)

27:04.824 --> 27:07.359
Yeah, well, you can.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.496
Remember, location is
more important than force

27:10.596 --> 27:12.198
when it comes to strikes.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.002
An open hand
to your opponent's ear

27:16.102 --> 27:18.637
can be just as effective
as a left hook to the jaw

27:18.738 --> 27:20.172
if you're trying to disrupt
their equilibrium.

27:20.272 --> 27:21.808
You.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.512
Good.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.916
Every girl in the zoo
is gonna be sizing you up.

27:30.016 --> 27:33.152
Trying to figure out where
you fit in the pecking order.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.856
Like what happened to you
in holding, but worse.

27:36.956 --> 27:40.426
You have
to project...confidence.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.231
Perception is reality,

27:45.331 --> 27:48.534
and perception
is formed right off the bat.

27:48.634 --> 27:52.204
You have to figure out who
to impress and who to knock off.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.672
How?

27:53.773 --> 27:55.908
By paying attention.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.409
Who are people afraid of?

27:57.509 --> 27:59.879
Who's the enforcer?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.948
Who's sitting together
at meals?

28:02.048 --> 28:03.515
And if you're ever in doubt

28:03.615 --> 28:07.720
about if somebody wants
to hurt you, hurt them first.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.524
So, you've been in jail
before?

28:12.624 --> 28:17.529
No. Arrested a couple of times,
but it never went that far.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.198
Then how do
you know all this?

28:19.298 --> 28:20.466
Because the rules in there

28:20.566 --> 28:22.134
are the same as they are
on the street.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.203
But with higher walls.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.038
I'm scared.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.207
That's okay.
You should be.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.809
Just don't admit it.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.111
I'll be right back.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.980
I just need
to blow my nose.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.324
(ringing)

28:45.424 --> 28:48.327
LORENA: Hola. Esto es Lorena.
Deja un mensaje.

28:48.427 --> 28:49.728
(beep)

28:49.829 --> 28:51.497
(button clicks)

28:51.597 --> 28:53.665
**

28:53.766 --> 28:57.236
(thunder rumbles, door opens)

28:57.336 --> 28:59.906
Are you sure he really doesn't
mind strangers in his house?

29:00.006 --> 29:02.441
Well, I'm sure
that he's out of town,

29:02.541 --> 29:05.477
and so it don't matter.
Okay.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.079
Here's the thing.
He's fine with it.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.948
Okay, well, I can't stay
too much later, though.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.449
'Cause if I get back late,

29:10.549 --> 29:13.485
my sitter
seriously gouges me, so...

29:13.585 --> 29:15.354
Back to the babysitter,
okay.

29:15.454 --> 29:16.789
Let's go.
How -- How did you --

29:16.889 --> 29:18.124
Or where did you guys meet,
anyway?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.026
Your -- Your rich friend?

29:20.126 --> 29:22.494
Believe or not, we knew
each other as kids.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.996
And he wasn't always rich.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.032
He was just like me.
Come on in.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.534
Here we are.
-(chuckles)

29:28.634 --> 29:29.535
Thank you.

29:29.635 --> 29:30.970
(rustling)
Oh.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.806
What's --
What (laughs)

29:33.906 --> 29:34.807
There's something
on the floor.

29:34.907 --> 29:35.975
(thunder crashes)

29:36.075 --> 29:38.610
Whoa.
All right.

29:38.710 --> 29:39.678
I'm not into
whatever this is.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.513
Okay. Please!

29:41.613 --> 29:43.349
Stop!
Let me go!

29:43.449 --> 29:44.951
Please! No!

29:45.051 --> 29:46.318
Stop!
(screams)

29:46.418 --> 29:47.319
(knife slashes)

29:47.419 --> 29:56.662
**

29:56.762 --> 29:58.330
**

29:58.430 --> 30:00.132
All right.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.969
Put her down.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.236
Cover her.

30:04.336 --> 30:06.372
Come on!

30:06.472 --> 30:09.876
**

30:09.976 --> 30:11.643
CHANCE:
He met one of my patients

30:11.743 --> 30:13.579
in group therapy at the Unit.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.647
I showed this picture
to the detective

30:15.747 --> 30:17.349
investigating Josefa's death.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.151
McClendon.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.989
He told me that if Winter had
no prior record of violent acts,

30:23.089 --> 30:24.423
he never threatened Josefa
or anyone else,

30:24.523 --> 30:25.757
then the police couldn't act

30:25.858 --> 30:27.894
on any information
I was giving them.

30:27.994 --> 30:31.163
When he killed her, he posed
her body to mimic this picture

30:31.263 --> 30:34.700
that I'd shown him as part
of a psychological evaluation.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.536
Oh. I mean, I see
what you're talking about.

30:37.636 --> 30:43.109
But, unfortunately, it's
the same for me, you know.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.077
You say
that he confessed to you,

30:45.177 --> 30:47.113
but you legally can't
give me any specifics.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.015
And the truth is,
without specifics,

30:49.115 --> 30:50.782
I'm --
I'm basically hamstrung.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.119
I don't know what to tell you.
I feel bad.

30:53.219 --> 30:56.522
You go out on a limb, and
the detective smacks you down,

30:56.622 --> 31:01.227
and here I'm smacking you down,
but I don't know.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.394
I'm really sorry.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.131
**

31:05.231 --> 31:08.867
So...can I ask you, is this
how you and Kevin met?

31:08.968 --> 31:11.971
He was sniffing around
on this Josefa Pefaur case

31:12.071 --> 31:13.705
because of Winter?

31:13.805 --> 31:17.109
No.
We -- We met last year.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.610
He was investigating a case.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.746
It was unrelated.
Hmm.

31:20.846 --> 31:23.549
A psychiatrist
was murdered in Berkeley,

31:23.649 --> 31:24.883
and he wanted to know
if I knew them.

31:24.984 --> 31:25.884
I didn't.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.087
I see.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.888
And then
he reached out to you again

31:29.989 --> 31:31.423
when he found out
that Winter

31:31.523 --> 31:33.325
was under your care
at the hospital.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.961
Is that it?

31:35.061 --> 31:37.997
More or less.
This fucking guy.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.766
This fucking guy was like a dog
with a bone with this shit.

31:40.866 --> 31:42.468
But he was right.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.137
I thought he was crazy
to begin with,

31:45.237 --> 31:47.773
but when I saw Josefa,
I knew he was right.

31:47.873 --> 31:49.741
Way before
Winter confessed to me.

31:49.841 --> 31:50.977
Yeah.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.611
It was hard
not to believe in Kevin.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.980
And I tried.

31:54.080 --> 31:57.149
And he made it pretty hard
to be his friend

31:57.249 --> 31:59.251
without getting yourself
in deep shit

31:59.351 --> 32:00.419
with the powers that be.

32:00.519 --> 32:04.991
But he was
a really good man.

32:05.091 --> 32:08.160
**

32:08.260 --> 32:12.431
Do you believe that Winter
killed him in self-defense?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.800
Do I believe it?
No.

32:14.900 --> 32:19.171
Can I explain to myself
what happened any other way?

32:19.271 --> 32:22.174
No.
He said
that he'd asked you

32:22.274 --> 32:24.110
to look into
a couple of things.

32:24.210 --> 32:27.546
Yeah, he came by my office
the other day,

32:27.646 --> 32:29.715
and he was --
was rambling.

32:29.815 --> 32:35.354
You know, he was -- He wanted me
to check up on this for him

32:35.454 --> 32:37.156
and -- and --
and make a call about that,

32:37.256 --> 32:38.524
but -- What did I tell him?

32:38.624 --> 32:40.993
I told him, yeah, I would,

32:41.093 --> 32:43.195
but then I just...

32:43.295 --> 32:45.497
just bum-rushed him
out the door.

32:45.597 --> 32:49.301
I don't know. Maybe if I'd
made more time for him then,

32:49.401 --> 32:51.403
he'd still be here today.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.905
Did he ask you
about Winter's assistant?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.842
Lyndsay, right?
Lyndsay.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.710
Yeah, he asked if --
God.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.547
He asked if she had had
a criminal record

33:01.647 --> 33:02.881
when she lived
in Connecticut.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.352
What was that about?
Did he ever tell you?

33:06.452 --> 33:10.189
He thought that she might be
Winter's accomplice.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.324
Really?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.893
Huh.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.397
Well, he never -- never said
anything about that to me.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.168
Did Winters say anything about
it when he confessed to you?

33:22.268 --> 33:23.435
No.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.504
Hmm.
What do you think?

33:25.604 --> 33:28.407
Do you think he -- You
think he had an accomplice?

33:28.507 --> 33:31.077
I don't know.

33:34.546 --> 33:38.184
Listen, I've -- I've got
a deposition, and I got to go.

33:38.284 --> 33:40.919
So, Doc...

33:41.019 --> 33:42.954
I want to thank you
for coming out.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.923
You know, it's --
it's nice to know

33:45.023 --> 33:46.592
that Kevin had
somebody else in his corner.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.527
And I'm not closing the case
on this.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.230
Or him.
Not until I'm satisfied.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.398
Me neither.

33:52.498 --> 33:56.402
Okay, well, let's keep
the lines of communication open.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.304
Either of us hear something,
we'll let the other one know.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.038
Okay?
All right.

34:00.139 --> 34:02.441
Great.
Thanks for coming in.

34:02.541 --> 34:12.418
**

34:12.518 --> 34:13.419
**

34:13.519 --> 34:15.254
(ringing)

34:15.354 --> 34:16.322
WINTER: Hello?

34:16.422 --> 34:17.389
Yeah.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.957
We need to meet, buddy.

34:19.057 --> 34:21.393
Right fucking now.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.065
MATILDA: Lillie Coit,
who the tower is named after,

34:27.166 --> 34:29.335
was an eccentric socialite.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.238
She smoked cigars,
wore trousers, gambled.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.440
In a lot of ways,
she was like my first husband.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.608
No, I'd say
there's half a chance

34:36.708 --> 34:38.677
that he's who
choked you out -- not Hynes.

34:38.777 --> 34:42.581
So he could put
you under his fucking
therapeutic mind control.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.015
You know, I blame myself.
I do.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.118
For thinking
that you heard me.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.520
For not stepping in.

34:48.620 --> 34:51.457
And for not realizing how --
how fucking convenient it is

34:51.557 --> 34:54.025
that you get jumped,
you end up in the hospital

34:54.126 --> 34:56.128
with a guy
who suddenly makes you

34:56.228 --> 34:58.297
fucking wonder
why you do things!

34:58.397 --> 35:02.868
So goddamn obvious.

35:02.968 --> 35:04.770
You know your Dr. Chance
and Hynes --

35:04.870 --> 35:07.206
They were friends, okay?

35:07.306 --> 35:11.377
Hynes told Chance
everything he knew about you.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.844
And Chance told Hynes

35:12.944 --> 35:14.346
everything
that you told him.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.614
Everything.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.150
You see, they --
they were working together

35:18.250 --> 35:20.186
to bring you down.

35:20.286 --> 35:24.790
Don't you get that?
The iconic Art Deco tower
was completed in 1933.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.226
That's why he was
so angry with me.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.295
Why he beat me up.

35:29.395 --> 35:31.630
Because Hynes
was his friend.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.299
What?

35:33.399 --> 35:36.335
That's what you're fucking
thinking about right now?!

35:36.435 --> 35:37.703
Jesus.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.206
I'm thinking about
how stupid I was,

35:40.306 --> 35:42.474
about what he did...

35:42.574 --> 35:43.809
Keep your voice down.
...what he said,

35:43.909 --> 35:45.544
what he promised me...
Shh! Shh!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.646
trust, betraying trust --
about all of it.
Shut up.

35:47.746 --> 35:48.914
Hey, there was
no betrayal of trust,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.549
'cause there was no trust
to betray.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.318
They were both trying
to hang you.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.152
Fucking Chance still is.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.687
Okay?

35:55.787 --> 35:59.858
So, what now?

36:01.893 --> 36:03.895
Those that are good
must suffer the same

36:03.995 --> 36:05.096
as those that are bad.

36:05.197 --> 36:08.500
He has to suffer.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.436
Like I have.

36:13.572 --> 36:14.773
Good.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.276
Very good.

36:17.376 --> 36:20.279
JUDGE RAMOS:
Case 2231981.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.448
Nicole Chance.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.082
I looked at
all the statements

36:24.182 --> 36:27.185
and been made aware
of Ms. Chance's open plea

36:27.286 --> 36:28.954
to reduce the charges
to battery

36:29.054 --> 36:30.289
causing
serious bodily injury.

36:30.389 --> 36:33.091
I was prepared
to issue a sentence

36:33.191 --> 36:35.894
when I got a call this morning
from a colleague and friend

36:35.994 --> 36:38.129
who wished to speak
on Ms. Chance's behalf.

36:38.230 --> 36:40.866
What is she talking about?
What's going on?

36:40.966 --> 36:42.601
And as it is too late
to include

36:42.701 --> 36:44.035
her written statement
in the file,

36:44.135 --> 36:46.805
I've asked her to appear
and speak on the record.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.774
(footsteps approaching)

36:54.045 --> 36:56.248
I'm Dr. Kirsten Clayton,

36:56.348 --> 37:00.218
and I would like to say a few
words about Nicole Chance.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.953
It was nothing.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.722
I wanted to do it.
Seriously.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.225
It was not nothing.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.327
It made a big difference.

37:08.427 --> 37:10.396
Trust me.

37:10.496 --> 37:13.131
You want to...

37:13.231 --> 37:17.336
You want to come over tonight
after work?

37:17.436 --> 37:19.104
Sure.
(door opens)

37:19.204 --> 37:21.307
CHRISTINA: I was so nervous.
I mean...

37:21.407 --> 37:23.141
Some--

37:23.609 --> 37:25.811
That was
wonderful and moving,

37:25.911 --> 37:27.679
and I will never be able
to thank you enough.

37:27.779 --> 37:30.015
I meant it.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.351
You can stay out of trouble
for a year of probation, right?

37:32.451 --> 37:35.086
Yeah.
And thank you.

37:35.186 --> 37:37.856
Mm.
I'm just glad it worked out.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.958
I'll see you.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.794
-Thank you.
-(breathes deeply)

37:42.894 --> 37:44.630
Mm.
I can breathe again.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.598
Mm. Me too.

37:46.698 --> 37:48.133
How do you feel?

37:48.233 --> 37:49.935
Really good.
She was scary, was--

37:50.035 --> 37:51.169
I thought
you were gonna get scared.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.604
I was!
I know.

37:52.704 --> 37:54.306
Would you just give us
a second, sweetie?

37:54.406 --> 37:55.607
Yeah.
I'll meet you outside.

37:55.707 --> 37:57.543
Oh, and thanks, Dad.

37:57.643 --> 37:58.544
For everything.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.945
Okay.

38:03.148 --> 38:06.051
WOMAN: I just don't understand
what took you so long.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.487
I can't stop thinking
about what you told me.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.457
About that girl
from your past.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.325
Yeah, I know.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.893
Do you?

38:14.993 --> 38:17.563
'Cause I know now

38:17.663 --> 38:19.731
that I was
what you settled for...

38:19.831 --> 38:24.069
that there was just no danger
of becoming obsessed with me.

38:24.169 --> 38:27.473
I was the low charge that was
just gonna keep you

38:27.573 --> 38:29.508
from shorting out.
Stop it.

38:29.608 --> 38:33.879
It's no wonder I was so alone
in our whole relationship.

38:36.014 --> 38:41.553
We're just gonna have to make
some changes going forward.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.190
I'm gonna have to.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.660
What do you mean?
What changes?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.596
I don't know yet.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.263
But I will.

38:58.437 --> 39:02.007
God damn it.
Where is this fucking guy?

39:02.107 --> 39:05.010
What about asking Lorena?

39:05.110 --> 39:07.913
She might know
where else Winter might go.

39:13.752 --> 39:14.753
What?

39:17.222 --> 39:20.058
I can't get ahold of her.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.960
Been trying
since she left the shop.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.631
First, the calls were
just going to voicemail.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.966
Now the phone's turned off.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.868
Is that a cause
for concern?

39:29.968 --> 39:33.639
She's pretty on the ball
in general.

39:33.739 --> 39:35.707
And she's got
stuff going on.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.376
It's not like she has to
report back to me or whatever.

39:38.477 --> 39:42.781
I don't know.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.585
I think she probably should've
called back by now.

39:46.685 --> 39:49.387
I think you're right.

40:06.337 --> 40:10.576
(breathes deeply)

40:10.676 --> 40:14.245
Nic, you know, obviously,
I'm -- I'm so happy

40:14.345 --> 40:16.515
that things turned out
the way that they did.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.817
Sounds like
there's a "but" coming.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.955
Just because you're not
going to juvenile hall

40:24.055 --> 40:25.691
doesn't mean we can go
back to the way things were.

40:25.791 --> 40:27.459
So, what does it mean?

40:27.559 --> 40:31.429
We need to make sure
that you are presented

40:31.530 --> 40:33.131
with good choices now,
always.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.501
That you are surrounded
with good energy and --

40:35.601 --> 40:37.135
Mom, stop trying
to not say whatever it is

40:37.235 --> 40:39.805
and just say it.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.474
You're gonna be spending
less time with your father.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.643
What?
Mm-hmm.

40:44.743 --> 40:45.944
Why?

40:46.044 --> 40:47.879
Because he told me
about his past.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.148
About what he did.
And I know that you know.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.717
Well, so what?

40:51.817 --> 40:53.284
So, that was
like 20 years ago.

40:53.384 --> 40:55.286
And he needed help,

40:55.386 --> 40:56.622
and that's what he got, so --
And I went,

40:56.722 --> 40:58.790
and I spoke
to a family therapist.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.959
And until I'm confident
that your father

41:01.059 --> 41:02.227
can be
a positive influence,

41:02.327 --> 41:04.029
given everything
that's happened --

41:04.129 --> 41:05.664
You don't know what
you're talking about.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.898
Dad actually gets all this.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.067
Okay.
Gets what?

41:09.167 --> 41:11.169
Talk to me.
I'm right here.

41:11.269 --> 41:12.971
I did what I did --
not Dad!

41:13.071 --> 41:15.406
He was just trying
to help me get through it.

41:15.507 --> 41:17.509
Better than
you have ever been.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.244
Like, if I had gone to juvie,
Dad was making sure

41:19.344 --> 41:21.146
that I would know how
to defend myself there.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.882
What?
What does that mean?

41:23.982 --> 41:25.216
What was he doing?
Tell me.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.252
Why?!
You won't understand!

41:27.352 --> 41:29.721
You never understand
anything!

41:29.821 --> 41:31.657
And I'm not fucking listening
to you!

41:31.757 --> 41:33.659

41:33.759 --> 41:35.594

In through the nose.

A count of four.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.207
(breathes deeply)

41:49.307 --> 41:50.441
Out through your mouth.

LUCY: Hey!
Sorry we're late.

42:00.786 --> 42:05.123
We took a car, but it's still
kind of a hike from the road.

42:05.223 --> 42:07.759
(chuckles)

42:07.859 --> 42:09.294
(laughs)

42:09.394 --> 42:11.129
Who's this?

42:11.229 --> 42:14.032
It's Willow.
Hi!

42:14.132 --> 42:15.901
My mom, she bailed on me
last minute

42:16.001 --> 42:17.703
for pinochle club.

42:17.803 --> 42:19.771
Right.

42:19.871 --> 42:23.041
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

42:23.141 --> 42:24.876
I-I should have checked
with you.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.578
But I thought if I told you
I couldn't get a sitter,

42:26.678 --> 42:27.946
you'd just say, "Don't come."

42:28.046 --> 42:29.915
She's really good.

42:30.015 --> 42:31.216
She honestly just sleeps.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.384
She's basically like
a people larva.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.486
I swear, it'll be fine.

42:35.587 --> 42:37.823
It will be
better than fine.

42:37.923 --> 42:39.791
It'll be perfect.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.394
Do you want to come in?
Yeah.

WOMAN:
The mailbox is full

43:02.013 --> 43:03.514
and cannot accept any messages
at this time.

43:03.615 --> 43:05.116
Goodbye.

WINTER: It was a federation
of children's charities.

44:09.114 --> 44:11.216
She was
on the governing board.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.252
I pledged them
some class B mutual fund shares,

44:14.352 --> 44:16.654
and Lyndsay was
the one I dealt with.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.825
And then she quit,
to help just me.

44:19.925 --> 44:22.327
That's awesome that,
you know, you had that.

44:22.427 --> 44:23.762
You're lucky.

44:23.862 --> 44:26.998
Does Dr. Chance know
where you are right now?

44:27.098 --> 44:30.235
No. Nope.
(chuckles)

44:30.335 --> 44:32.237
Does he know
anything about...

44:32.337 --> 44:36.041
Oh, I keep starting
to tell him, and then I don't.

44:38.609 --> 44:41.012
You care
what he thinks about you?

44:41.112 --> 44:42.547
He's a good person.

44:42.647 --> 44:45.751
He's fucking crazy, but he's
always been there for me.

44:45.851 --> 44:48.519
Maybe not exactly when I
thought he should be, I guess.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.421
But times that it turned out
to actually matter,

44:50.521 --> 44:52.057
looking back.

44:52.157 --> 44:54.592
Before I left to have Willow,
I never saw it.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.228
But going away
and being back now,

44:57.328 --> 45:00.531
I can't believe
that I didn't.

45:00.631 --> 45:02.600
The burnout.
The weight on him.

45:02.700 --> 45:06.071
How he hears and sees what
he hears and see every day,

45:06.171 --> 45:09.540
and then he has
to just go back to living,

45:09.640 --> 45:11.042
in the world.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.744
I don't want to give him
anything else bad

45:12.844 --> 45:14.279
to think about.

45:14.379 --> 45:15.881
I don't want
to weigh on him.

45:15.981 --> 45:16.882
I won't.

45:16.982 --> 45:21.319
**

45:21.419 --> 45:23.254
(door opens)

45:23.354 --> 45:25.056
**

45:25.156 --> 45:27.458
(metal clinking)

45:27.558 --> 45:32.898
**

45:32.998 --> 45:35.801
DANA: Nicole, wake up.

45:37.135 --> 45:39.270
My name is Dana.
I'm not here to hurt you.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.506
Mom!

45:41.606 --> 45:43.674
We're just gonna take you
with us on a little trip.

45:43.775 --> 45:45.476
Fuck that. I'm not going
on a trip with you.

45:45.576 --> 45:46.644
We're taking you to a place

45:46.744 --> 45:47.913
where you can
figure stuff out.

45:48.013 --> 45:49.280
No way!

45:49.380 --> 45:50.448
God damn it!

45:50.548 --> 45:52.183
Drape!
(muffled shouting)

45:52.283 --> 45:54.685
-Walk her now?
-Got her? She's a fighter.

45:54.786 --> 45:56.788
Mom, help me!
Got her?

45:56.888 --> 45:58.656
Please, Mom, help me!

45:58.756 --> 45:59.757
Flip!
Flip!

45:59.858 --> 46:01.259
-Mom!
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

46:01.359 --> 46:03.328
Don't let them take me!
Please!

46:03.428 --> 46:05.696
You're just gonna have
to trust me!

46:05.797 --> 46:06.998
(crying) I'm sorry!

46:07.098 --> 46:09.534
Please don't let them
take me!
Make it tight.

46:09.634 --> 46:12.037
Mom!
They're just gonna
take you someplace

46:12.137 --> 46:13.939
where people can help you!
-All right, hold her in.

46:14.039 --> 46:16.441
Hold her in.
-I love you, honey.

46:16.541 --> 46:19.510
I love you.
Please don't let them
take me!

46:19.610 --> 46:22.513
(crying)
Please don't!

46:22.613 --> 46:25.650
Mom!
Please don't!

46:25.750 --> 46:28.153
Don't let them!
Sorry! (screams)

46:28.253 --> 46:30.321
(water running)

46:30.421 --> 46:31.722
(running stops)

46:31.823 --> 46:34.525
Oh, shit!

46:38.563 --> 46:41.499
(sniffs)
Mm.

46:45.036 --> 46:47.405
(gasps) Shit!
Sorry!

46:48.506 --> 46:49.908
Um...

46:52.577 --> 46:54.479
Are you all right?

46:54.579 --> 46:57.748
(screams)
What the fuck are you doing?!

46:57.849 --> 46:59.350
No!

46:59.450 --> 47:00.886
(screaming)

47:00.986 --> 47:03.021
Get off! No!

47:03.121 --> 47:05.823
Get off!
(screams)

47:05.924 --> 47:07.592
(breathing heavily)

47:07.692 --> 47:10.261
**

47:10.361 --> 47:12.397
(Willow crying)

47:12.497 --> 47:21.506
**

47:21.606 --> 47:22.440
(screams)

47:22.540 --> 47:23.942
(siren wailing)

47:24.042 --> 47:31.950
**

47:32.050 --> 47:35.353
(sighs)

47:35.453 --> 47:36.587
(door closes)

47:39.557 --> 47:42.193
I-I know.

47:42.293 --> 47:43.628
Okay?

47:46.864 --> 47:49.634
What do you know?

47:49.734 --> 47:51.369
That I s-s-shouldn't...

47:51.469 --> 47:52.971
(breathes deeply)
It's all right.

47:53.071 --> 47:55.040
(voice breaking)
That I shouldn't have.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.541
I'm sorry.
It's all right,
it's all right.

47:56.641 --> 47:58.243
It doesn't matter.

47:58.343 --> 48:01.412
You're all right.
He was attacking me,

48:01.512 --> 48:02.981
and he had a knife,

48:03.081 --> 48:07.385
and all I could think
about was if -- if he --

48:07.485 --> 48:10.288
And if I couldn't...
I know.

48:10.388 --> 48:13.091
Then she'd be all alone
with him.

48:13.191 --> 48:14.259
All alone!

48:14.359 --> 48:17.996
And --
And h-helpless and --

48:18.096 --> 48:19.230
It's all right,
it's all right.

48:19.330 --> 48:21.632
You're -- You're safe now.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.001
You're both safe.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.136
He wanted to kill me.

48:25.236 --> 48:29.507
He was going to kill me.

48:29.607 --> 48:33.578
But then he just --
He -- He didn't.

48:33.678 --> 48:37.448
He just -- He -- I don't know
why he just let us go.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.285
Do you know
why he let us go?!

48:40.385 --> 48:41.319
Why did he do that?

48:41.419 --> 48:42.753
I don't know.
I don't know.

48:42.853 --> 48:44.022
It doesn't --
Why?!

48:44.122 --> 48:45.991
It doesn't matter.
You're safe now.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.458
Lucy, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

48:47.558 --> 48:50.361
After that,
he picked her up,

48:50.461 --> 48:55.933
and he handed me
a ph-- phone

48:56.034 --> 48:59.104
and said I should call you.

48:59.204 --> 49:01.372
Go call Dr. Chance.

49:01.472 --> 49:04.209
And so I did.
I called you.

49:04.309 --> 49:09.214
And we just waited there for
somebody to come and get us.

49:09.314 --> 49:12.650
Call Dr. Chance.
And it's my fault
because I...

49:12.750 --> 49:13.951
Call Dr. Chance.

49:14.052 --> 49:16.021
...I brought her there.
No.

49:16.121 --> 49:17.555
I...
Call Dr. Chance.

49:17.655 --> 49:19.890
It's over, and you're safe.
You're both safe.

49:19.991 --> 49:21.859
(knock on door)
Yeah?

49:21.959 --> 49:24.662
I thought Sirocco
was on call tonight.

49:24.762 --> 49:27.332
No.
Sirocco's on Thursday.

49:27.432 --> 49:29.634
What's up?

49:29.734 --> 49:31.802
A lieutenant at Richmond
Station just called.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.538
Had a guy
walk in an hour ago,

49:33.638 --> 49:35.406
starts confessing
to multiple murders.

49:35.506 --> 49:36.907
Waives his right
to a lawyer.

49:37.008 --> 49:39.010
Now, at first, they thought,
you know, a bedbug,

49:39.110 --> 49:41.379
but apparently the stuff
that he says

49:41.479 --> 49:43.748
is all starting to line up.
For real.

49:43.848 --> 49:45.250
No shit?
Yeah.

49:45.350 --> 49:48.353
Also, I guess he's a big deal
in tech or something.

49:48.453 --> 49:49.854
A lotta lotta money.

49:49.954 --> 49:53.191
Big guy in tech, huh?

49:53.291 --> 49:55.560
Okay. Chin.

49:55.660 --> 49:59.064
This or...

49:59.164 --> 50:01.599
A little rounder.

50:01.699 --> 50:05.736
So...that?

50:05.836 --> 50:07.105
Yeah, yeah.

50:07.205 --> 50:09.006
Well, shit.
Give it to me, then.

50:09.107 --> 50:10.241
Yep.

50:10.341 --> 50:12.210
(clears throat)

50:12.310 --> 50:14.045
Let's get to work.

50:14.145 --> 50:17.382
MOSS: And you said the neck
was more...right.

50:17.482 --> 50:19.850
Then we...

50:23.088 --> 50:25.356
That is
what he looked like.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.192
Fuck!

50:27.292 --> 50:29.527
That's the fucking guy
who attacked me!

50:29.627 --> 50:31.596
What do we do now?

50:31.696 --> 50:33.264
LAMBERT:
Who I am calling over there?

50:33.364 --> 50:34.699
Lieutenant who, you said?
Did you write it down?

50:34.799 --> 50:36.134
DENNIS: Yeah. Lieutenant Bibb.
Did you write it down?

50:36.234 --> 50:38.269
Lieutenant Bibb.
Oh, okay.

50:38.369 --> 50:41.206
Actually, you know what?
You do it for me.

50:41.306 --> 50:42.773
Get him on the phone for me
right now.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.242
Please.
Got you.

50:44.342 --> 50:45.743

50:50.648 --> 50:53.618
* No light when all the dust
has settled *

50:53.718 --> 50:58.723
* No life at all
will ever come from here *

50:58.823 --> 51:03.594
* Nobody left
when all the dust has settled *

51:03.694 --> 51:09.267
* You keep on trying,
but I see cold, cold blood *

51:09.367 --> 51:11.736
