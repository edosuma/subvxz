01:22.505 --> 01:24.405
What did you say to him?

01:25.908 --> 01:27.709
I tried to reason with him.

01:28.477 --> 01:32.947
No, what exactly, Jimmy,
did you say to him?

01:34.016 --> 01:35.917
He should have come to me.

01:35.951 --> 01:37.619
- And?
- That's it.

01:37.653 --> 01:40.221
He was terrified.
He knew it was over.

01:40.256 --> 01:41.923
So he killed himself?

01:41.957 --> 01:43.992
God knows
what he was capable of...

01:45.261 --> 01:48.663
No, no, we're finally on to him
and he ends up with half a head?

01:49.532 --> 01:52.534
Someone did this. Someone
didn't want him talking.

01:53.702 --> 01:55.270
Well, you're the cop.

01:59.675 --> 02:01.376
There's gotta be
something here.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.712
Something that connects him to
whoever he was working for.

02:04.747 --> 02:06.614
A diary, receipts.

02:08.851 --> 02:10.518
Look. Hm?

02:12.488 --> 02:14.489
This thing needs a fingerprint.

02:15.624 --> 02:17.759
- You're kidding me.
- I'm not.

02:17.793 --> 02:19.894
You'll leave yourself
all over him.

02:20.329 --> 02:21.996
Jimmy, come on.

02:22.965 --> 02:24.632
Ah...

02:25.034 --> 02:27.035
Jimmy...

02:29.171 --> 02:30.872
(Bleep)

02:30.906 --> 02:32.106
(Click)

02:40.015 --> 02:41.683
Look at this. Hm?

02:44.019 --> 02:45.820
- Money. Fucking money.
- Yeah.

02:48.824 --> 02:50.491
Okay.

02:52.728 --> 02:55.229
Charlie, you dumb fuck.

02:55.598 --> 02:58.299
(NANCY) Charlie? Charlie?

02:59.268 --> 03:00.868
We're gonna have to
say something.

03:00.903 --> 03:02.604
(NANCY) Jimmy? Jimmy?

03:06.342 --> 03:08.009
(Door closes)

03:19.622 --> 03:21.789
He never liked me going
into the den.

03:24.193 --> 03:25.693
Did you hear anything?

03:25.728 --> 03:31.065
The TV. He always managed
to find a game somehow.

03:32.601 --> 03:34.802
- Nancy...
- I'm gonna go be with him.

03:34.837 --> 03:37.438
No, no, no, no. No, I don't
think that's a good idea.

03:37.473 --> 03:38.973
He's all alone out there.

03:39.008 --> 03:42.510
You wouldn't wanna remember him like that.
Charlie wouldn't want that.

03:44.713 --> 03:47.148
Right. I know.

03:47.182 --> 03:48.883
Nancy...

03:49.852 --> 03:53.087
- Would Charlie ever have...
- Killed himself?

03:53.122 --> 03:56.224
He would never leave me.
Not like that.

03:57.159 --> 03:58.826
Is that what you think?

03:59.728 --> 04:02.196
Nancy, did anyone come by
after we left?

04:02.231 --> 04:04.565
- Did anyone call?
- What is she doing here?

04:04.600 --> 04:07.502
- What are you doing here?
- She's leaving.

04:07.536 --> 04:09.237
Sorry.

04:12.241 --> 04:15.243
Nancy, was there anything
after we left this morning?

04:15.277 --> 04:17.278
No. Some...

04:18.079 --> 04:21.416
salesman called and asked to speak to the
owner of the house. Nothing, nothing.

04:21.450 --> 04:22.984
And what did you do?

04:23.018 --> 04:26.087
I said Charlie was busy and
didn't wanna be disturbed.

04:26.121 --> 04:28.156
Was Charlie seeing anyone?

04:28.190 --> 04:29.957
- A girl?
- No, not like that.

04:29.992 --> 04:32.260
New business colleagues,
anyone coming around?

04:32.294 --> 04:35.063
- He didn't cheat on me, Jimmy.
- No, I know.

04:35.097 --> 04:37.865
- He would never cheat on me.
- I know.

04:40.069 --> 04:41.736
(Whimpers)

04:42.438 --> 04:44.072
My lovely Charlie.

04:44.106 --> 04:45.807
He's gone, isn't he?

04:46.575 --> 04:48.643
He's really...

04:48.677 --> 04:51.045
He's really gone.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.748
- I'm gonna die all alone.
- Don't talk like that.

04:53.782 --> 04:55.483
I'm looking out for you.

05:00.689 --> 05:02.690
I know how this works.

05:03.425 --> 05:05.093
I'll call 911.

05:06.595 --> 05:08.629
And you were never here.

05:10.032 --> 05:11.699
Go.

05:14.069 --> 05:15.737
Go.

05:28.617 --> 05:29.951
(Nancy sobs)

05:39.194 --> 05:42.830
- You got anything?
- Not yet.

05:43.232 --> 05:46.701
Could have used
a little organization.

05:46.735 --> 05:48.436
His will.

05:50.205 --> 05:52.640
Everything to Nancy.
All his debts.

05:54.176 --> 05:56.244
- Lucky her.
- There's nothing here.

06:00.516 --> 06:01.883
You think Charlie gave us up?

06:01.917 --> 06:04.018
Who knows?
He didn't give them up to me.

06:04.052 --> 06:06.154
Yeah, you would have shot him
in the head, right?

06:06.188 --> 06:08.656
- Same result either way.
- This is useless.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.428
Who could have given him
this kind of money?

06:21.703 --> 06:23.704
This the best you can do?

06:24.473 --> 06:26.140
I mean, you live here?

06:27.643 --> 06:29.944
Yeah, what do you think?

06:29.978 --> 06:32.280
I think I don't know
anything about you.

06:35.417 --> 06:38.352
You married? Huh?

06:40.689 --> 06:44.458
Have any other children
besides...?

06:44.493 --> 06:46.194
Sam?

06:48.463 --> 06:50.331
His name was Sam.

06:54.102 --> 06:56.370
Look, I'm gonna run this,
see if it's got a history.

06:56.405 --> 06:58.072
Yeah, not such a good idea.

06:58.106 --> 07:01.108
You might turn up something
you can use against me.

07:01.877 --> 07:03.544
Come on. We still on that?

07:04.780 --> 07:06.581
That whole trust thing?
Really?

07:09.585 --> 07:11.252
I had your phones, Jimmy.

07:13.088 --> 07:14.555
Are you in custody?

07:22.965 --> 07:25.299
- Milk?
- Sure.

07:27.202 --> 07:29.203
- Sugar?
- No.

07:35.944 --> 07:38.379
- I keep thinking.
- About?

07:40.682 --> 07:42.550
Alec.

07:46.955 --> 07:48.723
When he firebombed
the restaurant,

07:48.757 --> 07:51.525
how do you know that was Alec
just being a hothead?

07:52.094 --> 07:53.728
It could have been a move.

07:53.762 --> 07:55.596
Start something.

07:55.631 --> 07:57.498
Destabilize you.

08:00.636 --> 08:02.703
Even if you don't wanna
believe it...

08:03.538 --> 08:05.206
it is possible.

08:12.681 --> 08:14.348
Tastes like shit.

08:39.707 --> 08:42.243
(MAX) - How?
- Boom.

08:43.979 --> 08:45.646
Charlie killed himself?

08:48.283 --> 08:49.450
Dad!

08:49.484 --> 08:51.419
Or someone made it
look like he did.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.255
Fuck, why?

08:54.289 --> 08:56.624
I think he was paying for
Nancy's medical

08:56.658 --> 08:58.459
with part of my
missing 25 million.

08:59.094 --> 09:00.828
Charlie was moving against you?

09:00.862 --> 09:02.663
Charlie never showed
the initiative.

09:02.698 --> 09:04.665
He had to be working
for someone.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.501
Who? Did you talk to him
before he died?

09:08.070 --> 09:09.704
- Yeah.
- And?

09:09.738 --> 09:12.740
He wouldn't give them up.
Stupid... fuck.

09:14.676 --> 09:16.310
Jeez, I can't believe it.
Charlie?

09:16.345 --> 09:18.479
Uncle fucking Charlie.

09:22.651 --> 09:24.452
Was Jacks there?

09:24.953 --> 09:27.521
What?
When you spoke to Charlie.

09:28.757 --> 09:31.058
Jesus, dad, have you told her
about the missing money?

09:31.093 --> 09:33.260
No. She knows what I want her
to know. Nothing more.

09:33.295 --> 09:35.730
You don't need
to worry about her.

09:35.764 --> 09:37.365
Yeah, how can you be sure?

09:39.901 --> 09:41.769
- Dad?
- Look, the official line...

09:42.871 --> 09:45.439
Charlie shot himself.

09:45.474 --> 09:47.141
Nancy's illness
was getting worse,

09:47.175 --> 09:49.176
Charlie couldn't deal with it.

09:49.211 --> 09:52.179
I can't afford to rattle
the troops. Not now.

09:52.214 --> 09:54.181
Okay.

09:54.683 --> 09:56.517
Did you find anything
in Tony's file?

09:57.285 --> 09:58.552
Yeah.

09:58.587 --> 10:02.056
You remember Andy Wu?
I was at college with him.

10:02.090 --> 10:05.026
I took these to him,
got them translated.

10:06.762 --> 10:09.463
- They're hawala receipts.
- What's the point?

10:09.498 --> 10:13.934
Hawala, it's used to transfer money
internationally bypassing banks.

10:14.636 --> 10:16.404
It originated in Islamic law.

10:16.438 --> 10:18.205
People associate it
with terrorism.

10:18.240 --> 10:21.909
Everyone thinks that's how the
9/11 hijackers got their money.

10:21.943 --> 10:23.944
Hawala receipts, Max?

10:25.547 --> 10:29.183
These receipts are for money
transferred out of the country.

10:29.217 --> 10:30.751
Millions of dollars.

10:30.786 --> 10:33.521
I'm trying to find out
where the receipts came from.

10:35.690 --> 10:37.324
You didn't know anything
about this?

10:37.359 --> 10:40.061
The usual channels, that's
what Tony and I agreed.

10:40.095 --> 10:41.796
What the fuck was he doing?

10:56.978 --> 10:58.779
(Sniffs)

11:05.153 --> 11:07.121
(Exhales) Hey.

11:11.059 --> 11:12.693
This is my day.

11:13.628 --> 11:15.696
Dad gives me
Charlie's business...

11:19.701 --> 11:21.535
It's a step up.

11:22.671 --> 11:24.705
A big fucking step up.

11:26.942 --> 11:29.910
You've earned this.
You've sweated for it.

11:33.548 --> 11:35.516
(Exhales) I'm the man.

11:40.055 --> 11:42.223
I'm the fucking man.

11:51.500 --> 11:55.603
You wanted to see me?
Can we make this quick?

11:57.572 --> 11:59.507
Look, I was sorry to hear
about Charlie.

11:59.541 --> 12:01.175
Yeah.

12:01.209 --> 12:02.776
But I got to thinking,
you know,

12:02.811 --> 12:05.346
with Charlie being gone...

12:05.380 --> 12:07.214
I'd like to re-examine
our deal.

12:08.950 --> 12:10.351
Re-examine?

12:10.385 --> 12:12.453
Come on,
we're paying over the odds.

12:12.487 --> 12:14.155
You know that, I know that.

12:14.189 --> 12:15.890
Yeah.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.693
Why don't you
re-examine this?

12:20.295 --> 12:22.496
I'm wearing
a thousand-dollar suit.

12:23.198 --> 12:25.199
Now, if I have to
get blood on it,

12:25.233 --> 12:27.034
I'm not gonna be
very happy about it.

12:27.068 --> 12:28.736
- Alec, come on.
- Shut up!

12:28.770 --> 12:31.772
You use our containers
at the price we tell you.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.542
Is that clear?

12:38.613 --> 12:40.281
Now...

12:42.250 --> 12:44.385
I'm taking over
Charlie's business.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.054
Which means you got me
to deal with.

12:48.757 --> 12:50.758
Ain't you the lucky one?

13:00.168 --> 13:02.102
(Overlapping chatter
in Mandarin)

13:19.020 --> 13:20.688
(Chatter in Mandarin)

13:35.237 --> 13:37.037
- May I help you?
- Hopefully.

13:37.072 --> 13:38.772
(Calls out in Mandarin)

13:39.507 --> 13:41.175
You recognize these?

13:46.448 --> 13:48.682
- Some of them.
- They yours?

13:50.585 --> 13:52.219
Some of them.

13:52.254 --> 13:54.288
So you sent this money?

13:54.322 --> 13:56.357
Some of it.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.793
- Where'd you send it?
- Guangzhou, southern China.

14:01.429 --> 14:02.796
Who asked you to send it?

14:02.831 --> 14:04.598
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.

14:04.633 --> 14:08.569
Listen, the money you sent,
that was stolen. From me.

14:10.372 --> 14:12.373
He asked you to send it?

14:14.042 --> 14:15.809
Who picked it up
at the other end?

14:15.844 --> 14:18.712
Sir, I really don't know.
That's how hawala works.

14:18.747 --> 14:21.949
I tell my agent in Guangzhou
to release the money.

14:21.983 --> 14:24.852
Someone gives him agreed
password. He releases it.

14:24.886 --> 14:27.087
You don't understand,
I want my money.

14:27.122 --> 14:29.456
I'm sorry, that's impossible.
I don't have it.

14:29.491 --> 14:31.358
Then you better
fucking find it.

14:31.393 --> 14:34.461
You are welcome to travel
to Guangzhou to look for it.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.597
Listen to me,
you thieving fuck.

14:36.631 --> 14:38.332
Don't fucking touch my father!

14:38.366 --> 14:40.067
- Hey!
- (Shouts in Mandarin)

14:43.505 --> 14:45.572
(Calls out in Mandarin)

14:47.876 --> 14:49.543
Fuck it!

14:50.245 --> 14:52.079
(Cries out in pain)

14:54.883 --> 14:57.184
Max! No, Max.
No, Max, Max!

14:57.218 --> 14:58.819
That's enough. That's enough.
Let's go. Come on.

14:58.853 --> 15:00.287
Good boy. Huh?

15:01.256 --> 15:02.856
Good boy.

15:07.195 --> 15:09.396
Well, that was almost fun, huh?

15:09.431 --> 15:11.965
I know. That fucker was big.

15:12.801 --> 15:14.835
So my money's in
fucking China, huh?

15:14.869 --> 15:17.471
Tony will have had it cleaned
and brought back.

15:17.505 --> 15:21.275
I bet it's in an account in the US waiting
for the dead bastard to pick it up.

15:26.981 --> 15:28.649
(Doorbell)

15:32.320 --> 15:33.887
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:33.922 --> 15:36.857
Please, come on in. Bruise
seems to be healing nicely.

15:36.891 --> 15:39.259
- Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

15:40.195 --> 15:43.197
So, erm... how you feeling?

15:43.231 --> 15:45.766
I'm fine. How about you?

15:45.800 --> 15:49.036
Oh. I'm good. I'm good.

15:49.471 --> 15:50.671
And how's Evie?

15:50.705 --> 15:53.207
Not exactly on speaking terms
right now, so...

15:53.241 --> 15:55.008
Well, she's been through a lot.

15:55.577 --> 15:57.544
Yeah. Yeah, she has.

15:57.579 --> 15:59.613
Anyway, please, have a seat.

16:02.684 --> 16:06.453
So, erm... the reason
I wanted to come by

16:06.488 --> 16:09.556
was to let you know that I'm not
gonna take this matter any further.

16:09.591 --> 16:12.025
As far as I'm concerned
it's over.

16:14.329 --> 16:15.996
Thank you.

16:16.731 --> 16:20.067
Thank you for...
being so understanding.

16:22.170 --> 16:24.405
The school is prepared
to re-admit her

16:24.439 --> 16:28.108
but they're insisting she attends her
counseling sessions before they do that.

16:28.143 --> 16:30.177
That's fair.
That's totally fair.

16:31.279 --> 16:34.982
I have tried to get her
to go, all of us, actually,

16:35.016 --> 16:38.752
but Evie's not exactly one
to talk about her feelings.

16:39.621 --> 16:41.355
She gets that from her mom.

16:47.395 --> 16:49.396
Hey. Sweetheart, hi.

16:52.867 --> 16:54.201
I'm sorry.

16:55.303 --> 16:58.071
It's okay. Really.

17:10.151 --> 17:11.819
It's okay.

17:18.893 --> 17:20.894
(Low conversation)

17:22.864 --> 17:24.498
- Travis.
- Hey, Billy.

17:24.531 --> 17:27.367
- Grace. Long time.
- Wow. Look at you.

17:27.402 --> 17:29.102
You grew up handsome.

17:30.138 --> 17:32.139
You don't get that
from your father.

17:32.173 --> 17:33.774
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

17:33.808 --> 17:35.509
Come here. Give me some skin.

17:36.578 --> 17:38.245
Oh.

17:39.047 --> 17:40.848
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

17:43.184 --> 17:45.719
- Billy's about to graduate.
- What?

17:45.753 --> 17:46.854
Yeah.

17:46.888 --> 17:48.755
You must make your old man
very proud.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.591
Indeed he does. Yeah.

17:51.459 --> 17:53.794
I was sorry to hear about Sam.

17:57.532 --> 17:59.266
Thank you.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.637
He was a terrific kid.

18:08.676 --> 18:10.544
He was very fond of you.

18:12.447 --> 18:14.448
I'll never forget that.

18:18.286 --> 18:20.187
Anyway, I didn't mean to
crash your party.

18:20.221 --> 18:22.823
Hey, no. Join us.

18:22.857 --> 18:25.526
- Is the apple pie good here?
- The best.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.327
- Yeah? Well, count me in.
- Yeah.

18:27.362 --> 18:29.062
With some ice cream.

18:29.097 --> 18:30.397
Alright.

18:35.603 --> 18:37.571
So, er...
what flavor you having?

18:37.605 --> 18:39.306
- Chocolate chip.
- Yeah?

18:40.341 --> 18:42.509
Mm. I gotta learn
to live dangerously.

18:55.089 --> 18:58.325
- I need you to run that.
- I'm with my kid.

18:59.594 --> 19:01.261
Yeah, he's great.

19:01.462 --> 19:03.363
He's really, really great,
Mitch.

19:03.398 --> 19:05.866
- Yeah, I guess I got lucky.
- No, no.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.135
You've done a fantastic job.

19:09.304 --> 19:10.938
Thank you.

19:10.972 --> 19:13.006
- Charlie McGinley is dead.
- What?

19:15.009 --> 19:17.010
That money was stashed
in his safe.

19:19.013 --> 19:22.015
Oh. I'm going for
the chocolate chip too.

19:23.017 --> 19:24.685
Chocolate chip.

19:28.222 --> 19:29.890
(Low conversation)

19:32.994 --> 19:36.797
Three apple pies with
chocolate chip ice cream on two.

19:42.270 --> 19:44.738
...life, school. Girls.

19:46.741 --> 19:48.108
Well...

19:48.142 --> 19:50.210
(Soundtrack over dialogue)

20:00.421 --> 20:03.824
Suicide? Charlie?
There's no fucking way.

20:03.858 --> 20:06.860
I don't know. I mean,
Nancy is pretty fucked up.

20:07.228 --> 20:08.462
He adored that woman.

20:08.496 --> 20:11.431
There's no way he's leaving her alone
on this earth. Not out of his choosing.

20:11.766 --> 20:13.967
(MEN) - Hey, Alec.
- What's up?

20:14.002 --> 20:17.771
Good, we're good. We're just talking
about Charlie. Poor bastard.

20:17.805 --> 20:19.906
- He was a good man.
- Right.

20:21.342 --> 20:23.610
(Sighs)
We're gonna pull through.

20:25.046 --> 20:26.980
I'm taking over Charlie's gig.

20:27.882 --> 20:30.317
- Hey. Congratulations.
- That's great.

20:30.351 --> 20:32.619
Listen, you guys
want a drink? It's on me.

20:32.654 --> 20:35.022
- Don't mind if I do.
- If it's on you, yeah. Double.

20:36.591 --> 20:38.558
Thanks, Alec.

20:40.361 --> 20:42.629
- Sorry for your loss, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

20:44.832 --> 20:47.567
- What are you saying?
- I gotta spell it out for you?

20:47.602 --> 20:49.403
Tony, Charlie, who's next, huh?

20:49.437 --> 20:52.506
They're picking us off one by one,
and what's Jimmy doing about it?

20:52.540 --> 20:53.840
Where's his fucking head at?

20:53.875 --> 20:55.876
- Hey, Lloyd.
- Hey, Jimmy.

20:55.910 --> 20:58.078
- Gentlemen. Good to see you.
- You too.

20:58.713 --> 21:01.081
- Sorry for your loss, Jimmy.
- It's a loss to us all.

21:01.115 --> 21:02.916
- Absolutely.
- Fucking shame.

21:02.950 --> 21:04.551
I'm trying to make sense of it.

21:04.585 --> 21:06.620
- We were just saying that.
- Hm.

21:08.056 --> 21:10.357
- What can I get everyone?
- Er...

21:10.391 --> 21:12.626
Alec got us some drinks.

21:13.761 --> 21:16.163
- Alec, you beat me to it.
- Dad. Max.

21:16.197 --> 21:18.632
- You want something?
- No. No, you Enjoy yourself.

21:20.168 --> 21:21.635
To Charlie.

21:21.669 --> 21:23.170
(OTHERS) Charlie.

21:59.607 --> 22:01.408
(Door closes)

22:04.879 --> 22:06.847
(TOM) Hey.

22:06.881 --> 22:09.616
- Is Evie upstairs?
- She's not here.

22:09.650 --> 22:11.351
She's at my mom's.

22:12.220 --> 22:14.221
Oh, well,
you could have told me.

22:14.856 --> 22:16.223
I wanted to see her.

22:16.257 --> 22:18.291
I didn't know
you were coming over.

22:30.238 --> 22:31.872
How's school?

22:33.341 --> 22:35.675
You know. I can teach them.

22:36.444 --> 22:38.445
Doesn't mean
they're gonna learn.

22:43.584 --> 22:46.052
What's this? Ferndale
Elementary School.

22:46.554 --> 22:48.221
It's nothing. It's just...

22:51.526 --> 22:54.661
Ferndale's like,
four hours outside the city.

22:56.030 --> 22:58.365
Yeah, well...
they got a position too.

22:59.867 --> 23:01.802
Yeah, but you can't make
that commute.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.843
- You wanna move?
- I'm just looking. That's all.

23:11.179 --> 23:12.813
Were you gonna talk to me?

23:12.847 --> 23:15.348
Of course I was gonna
talk to you about it.

23:15.883 --> 23:18.518
When?
When it was already done?

23:19.754 --> 23:21.421
No.

23:22.156 --> 23:23.824
What about Evie?

23:24.892 --> 23:27.661
This...
this is for Evie, Grace.

23:28.229 --> 23:31.231
I mean, come on, you saw
what she did to that teacher.

23:32.066 --> 23:33.900
She needs to get out of here.

23:33.935 --> 23:35.869
The two of you
been talking about it?

23:35.903 --> 23:38.972
No, we haven't... I haven't
applied for the position yet.

23:39.006 --> 23:40.907
You're just gonna
take her away.

23:44.712 --> 23:46.379
Wow.

23:49.350 --> 23:51.017
(Tom sighs)

23:51.819 --> 23:56.489
Grace, I was going to talk to you. Of
course I was going to talk to you.

24:00.361 --> 24:02.028
(Grace sighs)

24:03.064 --> 24:04.898
How did we come to this?

24:07.468 --> 24:09.135
Er...

24:18.813 --> 24:20.480
Tom...

24:22.450 --> 24:24.117
I can't.

24:47.074 --> 24:48.341
(MEN) Charlie!

24:48.376 --> 24:51.578
And I got this one girl
on top of me, and Charlie,

24:51.612 --> 24:55.115
he takes this girl into the bathroom
and starts fucking banging away.

24:55.149 --> 24:57.317
I mean, really fucking
going at it.

24:57.351 --> 24:59.619
She is howling and wailing,

24:59.654 --> 25:02.022
like she's in some kind of
wild fuckin' heaven.

25:02.056 --> 25:05.592
And then bam, like a fuckin' explosion
and his girl starts screaming.

25:05.626 --> 25:08.361
I'm thinking, "What the fuck is that?
Has his gun gone off?"

25:08.396 --> 25:11.331
- I don't know. "Charlie!" I call out.
(OTHERS) - Charlie!

25:11.365 --> 25:14.801
He doesn't answer. Next minute water
starts flooding out of the bathroom

25:14.835 --> 25:18.805
and Charlie paddles out of the bathroom,
holding the toilet in his hands.

25:18.839 --> 25:20.373
The whole fuckin' toilet!

25:20.408 --> 25:23.276
He's banging this girl
so fuckin' hard,

25:23.311 --> 25:25.412
he breaks the fuckin' toilet!

25:26.380 --> 25:29.215
Jesus.
Charlie fuckin' McGinley!

25:29.250 --> 25:31.451
(ALL) Charlie!

25:32.286 --> 25:34.254
(Chuckling)

25:34.288 --> 25:37.223
- I'd never heard that one.
- Poor fuckin' bastard.

25:37.258 --> 25:39.326
That whole shit with Nancy.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.594
I had no idea it was so bad.

25:42.229 --> 25:44.230
Did anyone see that coming?

25:45.700 --> 25:48.935
Alec. You were talking
to him the other day.

25:50.738 --> 25:52.706
What?

25:52.740 --> 25:55.375
I saw you with Charlie
the other day.

25:56.677 --> 25:58.645
You seemed pretty close.

25:58.679 --> 26:00.780
He say anything to you?

26:01.882 --> 26:03.984
No, he didn't say nothing.

26:08.289 --> 26:10.390
We barely exchanged a word.

26:11.325 --> 26:13.760
Okay. I was just asking.

26:40.021 --> 26:41.788
Okay?

26:41.822 --> 26:43.957
It's fuckin' Max, man.

26:43.991 --> 26:46.626
Sometimes I could take
a fuckin' swing at him.

26:47.661 --> 26:49.462
What was that all about? Huh?

26:49.497 --> 26:51.631
What the fuck
is he trying to say?

26:52.767 --> 26:55.035
That whole thing
with Clay Street.

26:57.371 --> 26:58.905
I was too harsh on you.

26:58.939 --> 27:01.775
We've all been under a lot
of pressure lately and I...

27:01.809 --> 27:03.943
I haven't always...

27:03.978 --> 27:08.314
Oh, you know, whatever the fuck it is.
Supported you like I should.

27:08.349 --> 27:10.583
I know that.

27:14.388 --> 27:16.856
You were trying to do
the right thing,

27:16.891 --> 27:19.125
trying to make it right.

27:24.665 --> 27:26.933
I mean... (Chuckles)
Come on.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.502
Their... Their fuckin' heads.

27:29.537 --> 27:31.571
(Laughs)

27:33.407 --> 27:35.608
Maybe I went
a little over the top.

27:35.643 --> 27:37.744
A little?

27:40.347 --> 27:42.215
Listen.

27:42.249 --> 27:47.120
If there's anything... anything
you ever need to talk to me about,

27:48.689 --> 27:50.623
I'm here. Hm?

27:50.658 --> 27:52.859
Yeah. Yeah.

27:52.893 --> 27:55.962
Thanks, Dad.
I appreciate it.

27:55.996 --> 27:58.631
I really do. It means a lot.

27:59.433 --> 28:01.434
Come here.

28:04.572 --> 28:08.508
You know, if there's anything
you ever need from me, I'm here for you.

28:08.542 --> 28:10.610
- Yeah.
- Always.

28:13.581 --> 28:15.915
There is one thing.

28:17.818 --> 28:19.953
Yeah?

28:20.554 --> 28:23.156
I'm gonna need you
to give your brother

28:23.190 --> 28:25.859
all the support you can.

28:28.362 --> 28:31.131
He's gonna need it.

28:31.165 --> 28:34.134
I'm giving him
Charlie's business.

28:48.883 --> 28:51.151
Thank you.

29:34.995 --> 29:36.996
(Knocking)

29:41.201 --> 29:43.269
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:44.238 --> 29:45.938
So, what is it?

29:45.973 --> 29:48.975
The money that was in
Charlie's safe was marked

29:49.009 --> 29:52.545
- by the US Treasury.
- What?

29:52.579 --> 29:56.215
It was on loan out to
a San Francisco FBI officer.

29:56.250 --> 29:59.252
What the fuck was Charlie doing with
marked bills from a Fed?

29:59.286 --> 30:03.489
I pulled his file. Committed suicide
about five months back.

30:03.524 --> 30:07.693
Investigators found tens of thousands
of unexplained dollars in his account.

30:07.728 --> 30:10.963
All right? He was on the take.
He was about to be exposed.

30:10.998 --> 30:13.332
Shot himself.

30:15.102 --> 30:17.203
- Oh, my God.
- What?

30:22.943 --> 30:25.044
That look familiar?

30:28.515 --> 30:30.550
It's no coincidence, right?

30:30.584 --> 30:32.785
Christ.

30:36.323 --> 30:37.824
Michael Chen.

30:37.858 --> 30:41.427
I've been trying to contact the Bureau,
see what they have on him.

30:41.462 --> 30:44.564
Yeah, Michael Chen.
I was supposed to meet him.

30:44.598 --> 30:46.199
- Hm?
- Chen?

30:46.233 --> 30:48.868
- I was supposed to meet him.
- When?

30:48.902 --> 30:51.838
Oh, I don't know.
Five, six months ago, maybe.

30:51.872 --> 30:54.440
What happened?

30:54.475 --> 30:57.243
I waited.
I had Sam in the car.

30:58.612 --> 31:01.013
What?!

31:02.382 --> 31:04.517
Ohh...

31:11.992 --> 31:14.527
Yeah, I was off duty.

31:14.561 --> 31:16.829
I picked him up
from soccer practice.

31:17.698 --> 31:21.200
It was only supposed to be like a five,
ten-minute meet. No big deal, right?

31:23.637 --> 31:25.738
So the guy didn't show.

31:26.707 --> 31:28.941
We went home.

31:31.378 --> 31:33.646
I didn't think anything of it.

31:36.216 --> 31:38.284
You think Chen
was already dead?

31:40.587 --> 31:42.889
I don't know, Mitch. Maybe.

31:44.491 --> 31:45.892
Who set up the meet?

31:47.261 --> 31:49.595
- What?
- Who set up the meet?

31:52.132 --> 31:54.166
Wilson.

31:55.102 --> 31:57.703
That fuckin' low life Wilson.

32:00.741 --> 32:02.775
I gotta find him.

32:13.186 --> 32:15.187
(Siren wails)

32:26.366 --> 32:29.035
Oh, fucking joy! Travis.

32:29.069 --> 32:30.870
- Michael Chen.
- Who?

32:30.904 --> 32:33.773
Don't bullshit me.
Michael Chen.

32:33.807 --> 32:35.775
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

32:35.809 --> 32:38.844
- You set up a meet between me and him.
- I did?

32:38.879 --> 32:40.479
Five months ago.

32:40.514 --> 32:42.615
He was a Fed, from San Fran.

32:42.649 --> 32:46.586
- Treasury investigation. He killed
himself. - Oh, yeah. That bastard.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.554
What about him?

32:48.589 --> 32:50.856
- Why'd you have me meet him?
- I didn't.

32:50.891 --> 32:52.792
You set up the meet, Wilson.

32:52.826 --> 32:55.428
No... Hernandez wanted me
to meet him.

32:55.462 --> 32:57.196
Hernandez wanted you...?

32:57.230 --> 32:59.599
Some kind of favor to the Feds.

33:00.701 --> 33:02.068
So why'd you give it to me?

33:02.102 --> 33:04.337
I don't know. Must have been
busy or something?

33:04.371 --> 33:07.673
- Yeah, fucking some skank.
- Still busy, ain't it?

33:07.708 --> 33:10.443
Anyway, it was you
he needed to talk to.

33:10.477 --> 33:12.511
Why?

33:13.313 --> 33:15.348
- Fucked if I can remember.
- Wilson!

33:15.382 --> 33:19.051
He was investigating some
money-laundering scam

33:19.086 --> 33:21.988
involving shady Chinese
dealers or something.

33:22.022 --> 33:24.156
He reached out to Hernandez
for some intel

33:24.191 --> 33:26.025
- and she passed him to me.
- Why?

33:26.059 --> 33:28.594
Because he came across
the name Jimmy Laszlo.

33:28.629 --> 33:31.430
Michael Chen was looking
at Jimmy Laszlo?

33:31.465 --> 33:34.734
Yeah. He said he had a few questions,
take a couple of minutes...

33:34.768 --> 33:37.637
What is this--
a one-way street? Come on.

33:37.671 --> 33:39.672
Travis?

33:39.706 --> 33:41.741
Fuck that bitch.

33:42.843 --> 33:45.478
"Down, down, down.

33:45.512 --> 33:47.913
Would the fall
never come to an end?

33:47.948 --> 33:50.783
'I must be getting somewhere
near the center of the Earth.

33:50.817 --> 33:53.319
Let me see.
That would be...'"

33:53.353 --> 33:55.388
(Knocking)

33:56.256 --> 33:58.557
Won't be a moment, sweetie.

34:14.541 --> 34:19.210
- Can I help you? - Mrs. Chen.
Detective Jackie Hays, Oakland PD.

34:20.746 --> 34:23.849
- Don't. - I just have a few questions
about your late husband, Michael.

34:23.884 --> 34:26.786
- Haven't you people done enough?
- Excuse me?

34:26.820 --> 34:30.723
He gave everything to you and you
dragged his name through the mud.

34:30.757 --> 34:33.659
My husband didn't have
a corrupt bone in his body.

34:33.694 --> 34:37.163
- Ma'am, maybe I can help you.
- Wow. How many times have I heard that?

34:37.197 --> 34:41.000
How many times have I trusted
you and you did nothing?

34:41.034 --> 34:43.335
You're all the same.
Now get off my porch.

34:43.370 --> 34:46.272
Listen to me. I can help you.
I believe you.

34:46.306 --> 34:48.641
I believe your husband
wasn't corrupt

34:48.675 --> 34:50.309
and I can help you
get to the truth.

34:50.342 --> 34:52.678
- Please. You...
- Mommy?

35:01.755 --> 35:03.756
(Sighs)

35:32.886 --> 35:34.954
(She screams)

35:48.602 --> 35:49.602
Fuck!

35:57.077 --> 35:59.512
(Motorbike revving)

36:00.947 --> 36:02.848
(Screams)

36:02.883 --> 36:04.917
(Truck horn blares)

36:35.582 --> 36:37.783
(MAN) Shit. Did you see that?

36:37.818 --> 36:39.852
(Chatter)

36:44.624 --> 36:46.625
Alright. Alright. Alright.
Don't move. Don't move.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.294
Help is on its way.

36:49.863 --> 36:53.399
- I'm gonna call 911.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, you're in shock.

36:53.433 --> 36:55.000
You need to stay put.

36:56.870 --> 36:58.571
Lady, are you okay?

36:58.605 --> 37:01.207
- She's got a gun! She's got a gun!
- She's got a gun!

37:08.515 --> 37:10.916
(Groans)

37:48.421 --> 37:50.422
(Ringing tone)

38:17.284 --> 38:19.585
Is everything alright?

39:00.727 --> 39:02.962
Grace.

39:02.996 --> 39:05.030
(Siren wailing)

39:09.569 --> 39:11.570
(She groans)

39:21.481 --> 39:24.616
- You okay?
- What the fuck is going on?

39:29.222 --> 39:31.190
Did you tell anyone about me?

39:31.224 --> 39:32.791
No.

39:32.826 --> 39:34.426
- Did you?
- No, of course not.

39:34.461 --> 39:36.595
Why would I do that. Hm?

39:36.629 --> 39:40.733
Someone knows.
Someone fucking knows.

39:40.767 --> 39:43.769
You need to sit down,
take a breath. Hm?

39:43.803 --> 39:45.871
No, I need to talk to Tom.

39:55.148 --> 39:57.149
(Ringing tone)

40:06.559 --> 40:08.627
He's not picking up.

40:08.661 --> 40:10.262
Oh, please, God...

40:10.296 --> 40:12.631
He's okay.

40:12.665 --> 40:16.335
I don't know who that was
but they could go after him.

40:16.369 --> 40:18.604
Yeah. He's okay,
I'm telling you.

40:18.638 --> 40:21.707
I put one of my crew
outside your house.

40:21.741 --> 40:24.109
- What?
- Right after you called.

40:24.144 --> 40:26.178
(Ringing tone)

40:29.215 --> 40:30.315
Jesus.

40:30.350 --> 40:32.317
Nothing's gonna happen to him.

40:43.029 --> 40:45.964
- (Ringing tone)
- Come on, Tommy.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.033
(Phone rings)

40:55.809 --> 40:56.942
Hello.

40:58.111 --> 41:00.112
Tom.

41:01.114 --> 41:03.082
Grace?

41:03.116 --> 41:04.750
Yeah.

41:05.785 --> 41:08.287
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Why?

41:08.321 --> 41:10.422
<i>You didn't pick up the phone.</i>

41:10.457 --> 41:12.558
I left it downstairs.
What's wrong?

41:14.928 --> 41:17.162
Nothing.

41:17.197 --> 41:19.198
I just wanted to...

41:19.232 --> 41:21.400
Is Evie okay?

41:22.435 --> 41:25.604
Yeah, she's still
at my mom's. She's fine.

41:26.139 --> 41:28.173
<i>What is it?</i>

41:28.208 --> 41:31.410
No. No, it's fine.
You just...

41:32.679 --> 41:34.746
go back to sleep.

41:45.258 --> 41:47.226
Is everything alright?

41:47.260 --> 41:49.461
Yeah, I think so.

42:07.580 --> 42:10.082
You should have a doctor.

42:10.116 --> 42:12.151
No, I'm okay.

42:12.185 --> 42:14.219
You don't look okay.

42:17.357 --> 42:19.691
I don't think
there's anything broken.

42:20.994 --> 42:22.995
Will you help me?

42:26.666 --> 42:28.667
(She groans)

42:36.209 --> 42:38.043
Come here.

42:38.344 --> 42:40.412
Come here.

43:03.736 --> 43:05.704
Mm.

43:05.738 --> 43:07.940
Come here.

44:49.275 --> 44:51.743
That's a shitty way to go.

44:54.247 --> 44:57.549
Boys had a light like that in
the old Jackson Street house.

44:58.851 --> 45:01.687
One morning,
I hear this scream.

45:01.721 --> 45:04.790
I run in,
Alec holding his chin.

45:04.824 --> 45:06.858
Blood everywhere.

45:06.893 --> 45:09.227
Max, in his crib,
laughing his head off

45:09.262 --> 45:12.664
at a moth going round
and round inside the dome.

45:13.833 --> 45:17.102
Alec had fallen off the chair
trying to rescue the fucker.

45:17.136 --> 45:19.571
(Chuckles) Hm.

45:20.373 --> 45:23.742
Sam wanted to rescue things
all the time, too.

45:25.311 --> 45:30.048
Everything. Flies.
Spiders. Earwigs.

45:30.083 --> 45:34.119
He'd get his cup
and put it on top

45:34.153 --> 45:37.055
and then slide
his drawing pad underneath.

45:37.090 --> 45:41.727
And he'd make me go with him
to find the perfect spot

45:41.761 --> 45:43.362
to set 'em free.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.401
Kids, huh?

45:50.236 --> 45:52.237
Yeah.

45:58.744 --> 46:00.745
He'd be in second grade now.

46:03.983 --> 46:07.419
How someone like him
came from me...

46:11.824 --> 46:13.658
Hm?

47:08.614 --> 47:11.082
Jimmy. Jimmy.

48:14.980 --> 48:16.514
(TV) - Is there a Mr. Lambert?
- Yes.

48:16.549 --> 48:18.750
- Good for you.
- No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

48:18.784 --> 48:21.686
- Please. Not on my account.
- Oh. No. I just don't really love him.

48:21.721 --> 48:23.755
Well, at least you're honest.

48:23.789 --> 48:25.790
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
