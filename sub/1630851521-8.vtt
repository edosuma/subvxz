00:08.312 --> 00:11.011
Meredith:
<i>The way kids feel at Christmas</i>

00:11.054 --> 00:12.534
<i>is a pretty close equivalent</i>

00:12.577 --> 00:14.666
<i>to the way surgeons feel </i>
walking into an OR.

00:20.977 --> 00:24.154
<i>It's a complicated mix </i>
of anxiety and excitement...

00:26.113 --> 00:29.986
<i>...that makes it </i>
almost impossible to sleep.

00:34.121 --> 00:37.602
<i>The anticipation is the best </i>
and worst part.

00:37.646 --> 00:39.039
<i>Will this go my way?</i>

00:39.082 --> 00:41.519
<i>Will I get what I want?</i>

00:41.563 --> 00:43.173
<i>Will my patient live?</i>

00:43.217 --> 00:45.088
<i>Will they heal?</i>

00:45.132 --> 00:46.916
<i>Is Santa real?</i>

00:50.224 --> 00:53.488
<i>Stepping into an OR </i>
is its own kind of magic.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.159
<i>The possibility that on this </i>
day, you might save a life...

01:12.202 --> 01:13.725
I'm going to Minnesota. <i>...or end it.</i>

01:13.769 --> 01:15.292
In one hour.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.120
I have to talk to Amelia,
and it can't wait another day.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.426
I want to be with her
on Christmas.

01:18.469 --> 01:20.819
I want our family together
on Christmas morning,

01:20.863 --> 01:22.952
so I have to -- I have to
tell her I love her

01:22.995 --> 01:25.607
and that I don't need her
to marry me right this second.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.782
Right?

01:26.825 --> 01:28.088
I have to go?

01:28.131 --> 01:29.306
You have to go.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.134
Yeah, um,
I will watch Scout.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.831
Thank you.

01:32.875 --> 01:33.832
Oh, hey.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.269
You won't be alone
on Christmas.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.966
You and Luna
will be invited.

01:37.009 --> 01:40.100
Always!
You will always be invited.

01:42.624 --> 01:46.149
I do not like waiting,
especially for David Hamilton.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.717
Well, I've learned he doesn't
really care what people like.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.240
Oh, there they are.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.633
They've cleaned up the place
since I've been here last.

01:51.676 --> 01:52.764
Not as drab.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.723
Webber,
it's nice to see you again.

01:54.766 --> 01:55.680
David.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.944
Richard,
this is Kai Bartley,

01:58.988 --> 02:00.381
the lead neuroscientist
on the project.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.947
Pleasure to meet you,
Dr. Bartley.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.384
Thanks for accommodating
our team

02:03.427 --> 02:05.516
and making Grey-Sloan available
on such short notice.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.562
The project's already
using my surgeons.

02:07.605 --> 02:09.172
Might as well use
my operating room.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.347
You know how it is.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.609
Famous patient,

02:11.653 --> 02:13.002
trailblazing neurosurgery,

02:13.045 --> 02:14.699
futuristic equipment.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.224
Not to mention the great
Meredith Grey walking the halls.

02:17.267 --> 02:20.314
The people of Minnesota
were asking questions.

02:20.357 --> 02:22.185
It threatened the work.

02:22.229 --> 02:26.015
Well, I hope it works,
for your sake and science.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.451
I wish
you could observe,

02:27.495 --> 02:29.540
but we can't compromise
the secrecy of the technology.

02:29.584 --> 02:30.672
It's essential
personnel only.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.108
I have residents
to teach.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.023
And I've got
pre-op bloodwork to do,

02:34.066 --> 02:36.939
so, Dr. Bartley, Dr. Shepherd,
I'll see you at game time.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.288
Thanks again, Webber.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.637
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Dr. Brooks to oncology.</i>

02:39.681 --> 02:41.161
<i>Dr. Brooks to oncology.</i>

02:41.204 --> 02:44.947
Famous patient?
He's not Bono.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.124
In Minnesota, he's about
as close as you can get.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.431
Prince
was from Minnesota.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.215
Excuse me.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.223
Hey.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.399
Excuse me, but only doctors who
actually work in this hospital

03:02.443 --> 03:03.444
are supposed to be
in the lounge.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.880
Security risk.

03:07.491 --> 03:11.669
So, we've all been told
to stay away from OR 2.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.193
I suppose that's where
the super-secret project

03:13.236 --> 03:14.324
is happening?

03:14.368 --> 03:16.196
Can't say.
Security risk.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.330
It's good to see you.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.940
It's good to see <i>you.</i>

03:26.423 --> 03:27.903
How are you doing?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.428
Oh.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.387
The holidays are hard,
I know.

03:33.430 --> 03:34.997
My wife loved Christmas.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.652
Like collected nutcrackers
kind of loved it.

03:37.695 --> 03:41.525
This time of year for the boys,
we just...

03:41.569 --> 03:43.179
We miss her so much,
you know?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.702
I'm so sorry.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.792
Hm.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.360
You know...

03:50.404 --> 03:52.449
she might
still love Christmas.

03:52.493 --> 03:54.538
So this is going to sound
completely ridiculous

03:54.582 --> 03:55.844
and very unscientific,

03:55.887 --> 03:58.281
and I always thought of myself
as an atheist,

03:58.325 --> 04:01.589
and I did believe that we start
and end with the body,

04:01.632 --> 04:06.071
but when I was sick,
I had a dream --

04:06.115 --> 04:08.117
or what I thought
was a dream.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.599
I dreamt about Derek
on a beach,

04:11.642 --> 04:15.080
and it felt so real.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.604
It felt like
it wasn't a dream.

04:16.647 --> 04:20.608
I mean, it felt like...
he's here.

04:20.651 --> 04:24.002
Like he's been with me
this whole time.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.440
Like he might be here
with me now.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.529
And today I'm doing
this groundbreaking surgery.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.444
And it's exactly
the type of thing

04:30.487 --> 04:33.055
that he would have
loved to do.

04:33.098 --> 04:35.623
And in the past,
that would have made me sad,

04:35.666 --> 04:39.279
but somehow, I think
he might just be here,

04:39.322 --> 04:41.237
hovering over me,
watching the whole thing,

04:41.281 --> 04:42.978
soaking it all in.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.588
And that makes me happy.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.333
And please don't tell anyone
I'm telling you this,

04:50.377 --> 04:53.293
because I am acutely aware
of how ridiculous it sounds.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.209
No, not crazy.

04:57.253 --> 04:58.907
Kind.

04:58.950 --> 05:02.476
It's very kind of you
to share that with me, Grey.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.835
You know, I could hear you
on the beach, too.

05:13.878 --> 05:16.490
Were you talking to me
about my children?

05:18.840 --> 05:20.320
I was.

05:20.363 --> 05:23.192
I heard you,
and it helped.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.198
PICU.

05:29.241 --> 05:30.765
Good luck with whatever
you're doing today, Grey.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.114
Thank you.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.072
And, um,
thank you, Grey.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.857
Maybe I'll go pick up
a nutcracker after work

05:35.900 --> 05:37.119
or something.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.253
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:45.214 --> 05:48.086
What, you scheduled the lawyer
for Friday morning?
Mm-hmm.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.350
Oh, I have
a sleeve gastrectomy,

05:50.393 --> 05:52.090
and then I'm supposed to
have clinic.

05:52.134 --> 05:54.179
I'm still on shift
on Thursday morning.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.703
Oh, can you get a sub?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.705
It's the holidays.
No.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.141
Um, Monday?

05:59.184 --> 06:00.403
That's next week.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.623
Okay, how are we
supposed to fight for Pru

06:02.666 --> 06:04.320
if we can't even fit it
into our calendars?

06:04.364 --> 06:07.628
Miranda, we are doing our best
in a world of uncertainty.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.281
Mm.

06:09.325 --> 06:10.892
And I will look into
getting a sub.

06:10.935 --> 06:12.154
Thank you.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.374
But if I do,
will you at least consider

06:14.417 --> 06:16.419
- taking it easy at work?
- What?

06:16.463 --> 06:18.639
I just think we need to go
spend some time as a family.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.337
We could go look at lights
or ice-skate.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.295
Come on.
Dean loved Christmas.

06:23.339 --> 06:25.428
Oh, oh.
We could go caroling.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.648
We are not
going caroling, Benjamin.

06:27.691 --> 06:28.997
Yeah, as soon as the words
left my mouth,

06:29.040 --> 06:29.911
I knew you were gonna
give me that look.
See?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.086
Chief Bailey.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.002
Oh, Dr. Wright.
Hey. Happy First Day.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.264
Hey, thank you.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.961
This is my husband,
Ben Warren.

06:37.005 --> 06:37.919
- Hey.
- Morning. Oh.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.224
Okay, sorry.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.225
Coffee?

06:40.269 --> 06:41.966
Regular or decaf.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.664
I wasn't sure which one you
wanted, so I got one of each.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.448
They also had this holiday
candy cane thing,

06:45.492 --> 06:46.971
but I felt
that was a bit risky.

06:47.015 --> 06:49.757
Yeah, well, I have my morning
smoothie, so thank you,

06:49.800 --> 06:51.628
but I'm sure someone around here
wants it.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.674
Like me.
Regular?

06:53.717 --> 06:56.677
I fight fires.
I need this.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.244
Well, I don't want
to keep you.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.421
I just wanted to tell you
how happy I am

07:01.464 --> 07:03.423
to finally learn from you
in person.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.555
- So, uh, see you in there?
- Mm-hmm.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.426
Okay.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.646
Still got it.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.431
Get out of here.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.280
How are you
holding up?

07:39.720 --> 07:43.332
Megan, maybe you
should take a break.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.553
Get outside, maybe take a walk,
grab a nap.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.644
I can sit with him
for a while.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.297
If he doesn't make it,
neither do I.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.086
If Farouk dies,
I go with him.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.480
I'm not sticking around.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.612
Not interested
in surviving another chapter

08:02.656 --> 08:03.961
of earth-shattering pain.

08:04.005 --> 08:05.528
I've survived enough
in this life.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.051
I'm not willing
to survive this.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.056
Megan...

08:12.100 --> 08:13.318
I'm sorry
I said that to you.

08:13.362 --> 08:18.759
I-I just --
I needed to say it to someone,

08:18.802 --> 08:20.543
and it can't be my brother
and it can't be my mother

08:20.587 --> 08:21.588
and it can't be Teddy.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.593
I just wanted someone to know
that I've loved this life.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.638
Or parts of it.
I've loved parts of this life.

08:28.682 --> 08:30.292
But...

08:30.335 --> 08:32.816
I'm just not willing
to survive this.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.699
Noah's service was nice.
Packed.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.657
Yeah.

08:47.701 --> 08:49.833
You know, some of the guys
from the support group

08:49.877 --> 08:52.619
are gonna buy a Christmas tree
and some decorations for Danny.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.446
I mean, we -- we could
contribute some gifts.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.231
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.234
Owen, Heather and Danny,
eventually, they will be ok--

08:59.277 --> 09:01.671
I know.
I know, okay?

09:01.715 --> 09:03.978
I think there's already
some relief for Heather,

09:04.021 --> 09:05.762
knowing that
he's out of pain.

09:07.416 --> 09:08.722
Winston. 911.

09:08.765 --> 09:09.592
Yeah.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.338
What happened?

09:16.381 --> 09:19.036
15-year-old MVC, suffered
a catastrophic brain injury.

09:19.080 --> 09:19.907
He's been
declared brain dead.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.517
Oh, my God.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.432
I don't understand.
Is he here? Do we know him?

09:23.475 --> 09:25.477
- Megan?
- No, no, he's in Tacoma.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.262
He's an organ donor.
UNOS just called.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.960
The heart is a match
for Farouk.

09:30.004 --> 09:33.485
Oh, my God.

09:33.529 --> 09:34.965
Oh, my God.

09:37.054 --> 09:40.928
He's gonna be --
He's gonna be okay.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.626
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.410
Oh, my God. My baby.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.469
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.731
Oh, thank you.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.083
Oh. You're supposed to be
in Minnesota.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.607
I came back early
for a surgery.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.652
Hello, my sweet boy.
What a happy surprise.

10:09.696 --> 10:10.871
Yeah.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.613
Link went to, um,
get a Christmas tree,

10:13.656 --> 10:15.353
so I said I would take the kids
to daycare.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.660
Got it. Okay.
Well, I-I've got him from here.

10:17.704 --> 10:19.662
Yeah, of course.

10:19.706 --> 10:20.837
Um...

10:20.881 --> 10:23.100
Can I ask you,
how is Link doing?

10:23.144 --> 10:24.798
Things have been
a little...

10:24.841 --> 10:26.713
How is he?

10:26.756 --> 10:27.888
He's fine.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.237
Okay.
Okay.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.108
Um, a-are you coming
to daycare?

10:31.152 --> 10:32.196
No.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.937
Yes.
I just, um --

10:33.981 --> 10:36.287
I have to, uh,
grab her binky from the car.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.419
Okay.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.380
And I have to call him now,
right?

10:42.424 --> 10:43.643
Because whatever
these feelings are,

10:43.686 --> 10:45.427
they are new and stupid

10:45.470 --> 10:47.951
and need to go back to whatever
dark hole of desperation

10:47.995 --> 10:49.039
they crawled out of.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.475
Okay.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.175
Hey, I'm almost
to the airport.

10:54.218 --> 10:55.785
Jo:
<i> Amelia's in Seattle.</i>

10:55.829 --> 10:58.005
Uh, no,
she's in Minnesota.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.268
<i> Dude, I was just in the </i>
elevator with her in Seattle,

11:00.311 --> 11:02.357
so if you want to see her,
do not get on the plane.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.276
The "dude" was a little much,
right?

11:11.801 --> 11:14.412
Winston is starting Farouk
on the induction therapy now.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.588
As soon as we're en route
with the donor heart,

11:16.632 --> 11:17.894
he'll bring him to the OR
and get him ready.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.374
Tacoma's close by.
We'll have plenty of time.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.592
Wait.
Both of you are going?

11:20.636 --> 11:21.898
Yeah, I want to put eyes
on the heart myself,

11:21.942 --> 11:23.595
make sure they don't screw it up
in Tacoma.

11:23.639 --> 11:24.988
My mom's on her way
to take care of Megan.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.729
Well, I'm coming, too.
My patient.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.557
And we've got things
to discuss.

11:38.872 --> 11:39.960
Are you in pain?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.178
No.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.356
I was praying.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.794
Mm. Well, don't sound
so ashamed.

11:47.837 --> 11:51.798
Well, I've never been entirely
sure what it is I believe in,

11:51.841 --> 11:55.018
so it's -- it's --
it's all very confusing,

11:55.062 --> 11:57.020
this part
where I might die now.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.500
Well, you're not
going to die.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.023
Oh, anything can happen
in there.

12:00.067 --> 12:01.111
You know that.

12:01.155 --> 12:02.852
I hope I don't die today,

12:02.896 --> 12:09.424
but I left notes for my wife
and kids and grandkids.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.427
They're saved in the --
in the draft file of my e-mail.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.690
The passwords are on a Post-it
on the computer.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.126
I didn't want
to send the notes.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.867
If everything
goes perfectly,

12:17.911 --> 12:22.742
I don't want to have put them
through all that for no reason.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.656
I've been awful to you,
Dr. Grey.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.658
I've been the very worst parts
of myself,

12:26.702 --> 12:28.051
and before you put me under,

12:28.095 --> 12:32.360
I want to be sure
you know both...

12:32.403 --> 12:35.406
how sorry I am
for my behavior

12:35.450 --> 12:37.887
and how grateful I am
to you.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.760
I may have written those notes
to the kids and the grandkids

12:40.803 --> 12:42.762
just to remind you that
I'm a dad and a granddad,

12:42.805 --> 12:44.589
not just a megalomaniac.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.243
So as you're cutting
into my brain today,

12:46.287 --> 12:48.811
please try to remember
there are people who love me,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.422
even if you're
not one of them.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.773
Well, I appreciate
the apology.

12:53.816 --> 12:56.079
I assure you, I have
absolutely every intention

12:56.123 --> 12:58.038
of making history today.

12:58.081 --> 13:01.171
And if this works, you will
not only live, you will heal.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.090
You're sure
you're not in pain?

13:07.134 --> 13:09.266
Only the existential kind.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.746
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.403
Bailey:
Last time I checked,

13:15.446 --> 13:18.319
Dr. Webber and I deserved
the respect of punctuality.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.973
It was his fault.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.626
Someone was supposed to
wake me up.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.803
Richard:
Before we hand out assignments,

13:23.846 --> 13:26.414
we'd like to introduce
our new fourth-year resident,

13:26.457 --> 13:29.199
transfer from Minnesota,
Jordan Wright.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.810
Do you mind, sir?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.637
Um...

13:32.681 --> 13:34.030
Alright.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
The floor is yours.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.642
Excuse me.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.645
Um, wow.
Hey, folks.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.647
I would like to say
an official hello

13:42.691 --> 13:44.911
and tell you how excited I am
to be here.

13:44.954 --> 13:48.218
Grey-Sloan's my Yankee Stadium,
so here I am,

13:48.262 --> 13:51.874
facing current legends,
Chief Bailey, Dr. Webber,

13:51.918 --> 13:54.442
and, uh,
future legends.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.531
Okay, um,
that's all I got.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.620
Alright. Good.

13:58.663 --> 13:59.969
He likes sports.
Gross.

14:00.013 --> 14:01.884
Alright, assignments.
Listen up.

14:01.928 --> 14:05.105
Some of you will fly solo
using the Webber Method,

14:05.148 --> 14:06.802
and some of you will not.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.760
Tseng, merry Christmas.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.763
You are on cardio
for a heart transplant.

14:11.807 --> 14:14.462
Perez,
you have an appy in OR 5.

14:14.505 --> 14:16.203
Schmitt and Helm,

14:16.246 --> 14:19.728
you will be doing
an ileostomy takedown in OR 4.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.772
Dr. Wright --

14:20.816 --> 14:22.774
Dr. Wright,
we're assigning you

14:22.818 --> 14:25.081
a solo laparoscopic
sigmoidectomy

14:25.125 --> 14:26.648
for diverticulitis.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.606
I'm not sure, a-are you familiar
with my method --

14:28.650 --> 14:30.826
I'm -- I'm familiar
with it, sir,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.611
and with your blessing,
I'll take a rain check.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.267
A rain check?

14:37.311 --> 14:38.616
Yeah.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.488
On which part?

14:40.531 --> 14:42.838
I-I'm more than happy
to do the bowel resection,

14:42.882 --> 14:46.755
but respectfully, I'd prefer
not to use the Webber Method.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.713
I'm here to learn
from Chief Bailey,

14:48.757 --> 14:52.892
so I'd like the opportunity
to...learn from Chief Bailey.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.678
Guess I'm scrubbing in.

15:02.902 --> 15:03.903
Hey.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.121
Koracick's called me
like 10 times

15:05.165 --> 15:06.296
wanting to know
if we've started.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.558
They're moving Hamilton
up to pre-op.

15:07.602 --> 15:08.951
Okay.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.126
You okay?

15:12.781 --> 15:14.043
Come inside.
It's cold.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.700
Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.441
I think we'll both feel better
if I just say it.

15:23.444 --> 15:26.751
We are drilling a hole
into a renowned surgeon's head

15:26.795 --> 15:29.319
using a piece of equipment
we just invented

15:29.363 --> 15:31.017
to inject
a cellular solution

15:31.060 --> 15:33.802
that has never been tested
on a human being before

15:33.845 --> 15:35.891
to cure what has heretofore
been considered

15:35.935 --> 15:38.154
an entirely
incurable disease.

15:50.601 --> 15:53.343
You're right.
That made me feel much better.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.693
Let's go.

16:06.226 --> 16:08.619
The Webber Method only works
on specific procedures

16:08.663 --> 16:10.143
that have maybe one
or two crucial points

16:10.186 --> 16:11.709
that require supervision.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.581
The resident operates
to a predetermined point --

16:13.624 --> 16:15.887
- Any resident?
- Only those residents
who've shown

16:15.931 --> 16:18.281
that they can independently
and competently open the patient

16:18.325 --> 16:19.891
and then dissect
to where they need to be.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.023
I'd love to see that list.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
Once they get to

16:22.677 --> 16:24.853
the difficult part
of the procedure, they pause.

16:24.896 --> 16:25.985
They wait for their attendings
to arrive,

16:26.028 --> 16:27.421
and then they continue.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.988
Okay, so this is just
for general surgery, right?

16:29.031 --> 16:31.555
As for now, but we're hoping
to implement it

16:31.599 --> 16:32.730
across all specialities.

16:32.774 --> 16:35.516
Hmm. No. No.
Not mine. Not cardio.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.648
No hearts
in baby surgeons' hands.

16:37.692 --> 16:39.085
No. I -- Come --
No, sorry.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.390
You busy?

16:40.434 --> 16:41.739
I have a lobectomy
in a few hours.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.741
Great,
so you can come with me

16:43.785 --> 16:45.917
and watch how the method works
in action.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.140
Teddy:
If everything goes smoothly,

16:51.184 --> 16:54.404
this heart will be the best
Christmas gift for Farouk.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.102
Maybe we can even get him home
by New Year's.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.407
What about Megan?

16:57.451 --> 16:58.713
What about her?

17:00.628 --> 17:02.456
She's not alright.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.545
I've been sitting here
for the last half-hour

17:04.588 --> 17:06.329
trying to figure out how to
talk to the two of you about her

17:06.373 --> 17:08.288
without overstepping.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.334
Her sun is on ECMO and they're
awaiting a new heart.

17:11.378 --> 17:13.684
She's sleep-deprived
and anxious,

17:13.728 --> 17:15.469
like any parent would be.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.427
I've dealt with a lot of anxious
and depressed parents

17:17.471 --> 17:19.647
over the years,
but this is different.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.302
Look, Hunt,
I know she's your sister.

17:22.345 --> 17:23.607
This is hard for you to hear,
but...

17:23.651 --> 17:25.740
Listen. Megan is tougher
than you think,

17:25.783 --> 17:28.395
and she's been through way worse
than we could even imagine.

17:28.438 --> 17:29.831
I'm aware,
and I'm still telling you

17:29.874 --> 17:30.962
that she needs
serious help.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.616
She is <i>not</i> alright.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.183
Teddy:
Hayes, this is a good day.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.664
We have a heart for Farouk,

17:36.707 --> 17:38.927
and when he's okay,
she'll be okay.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.363
And what if
he's not okay?

17:40.407 --> 17:41.756
There's still a million things
that can go wrong here.

17:41.799 --> 17:42.757
Hayes.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.280
I know you guys want
to celebrate,

17:44.324 --> 17:45.629
but I need you
to understand

17:45.673 --> 17:46.935
what your sister
just said to me,

17:46.978 --> 17:48.154
and I'm not sure
that it's cured

17:48.197 --> 17:49.764
even with a heart transplant
for her son.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.331
She is profoundly
depressed.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.248
Um, uh,
we're five minutes out.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.690
Devon, an ileostomy takedown's
fairly straightforward.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.431
We'll just start with
an incision around the stoma,

18:04.474 --> 18:05.736
and then through that,

18:05.780 --> 18:07.086
we'll extract the part
of the intestine that --

18:07.129 --> 18:09.131
Do what you have to do.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.394
I'll just be stoked to get some
quality time outdoors again.

18:11.438 --> 18:14.658
After my ulcerative colitis
diagnosis and the surgery,

18:14.702 --> 18:17.270
recovery, and now surgery
to recover from the recovery...

18:17.313 --> 18:19.359
The wound from this procedure
should heal in a month or so.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.621
Too much time
stuck to a bed,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.188
your mind goes
to some ugly places.

18:22.231 --> 18:24.755
I'm sorry, I --

18:24.799 --> 18:26.583
Have we met?

18:26.627 --> 18:28.281
Don't think so.

18:28.324 --> 18:30.370
Your voice,
it's so familiar.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.719
No, I feel like we've --

18:32.981 --> 18:34.374
Oh, my God.

18:34.417 --> 18:35.766
You're Devon Gomez.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.855
I-I listen
to your podcast.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.683
How about that?

18:39.727 --> 18:40.945
Small world.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.164
What podcast?

18:42.208 --> 18:44.035
He hosts a show called
"On Foot with Devon"

18:44.079 --> 18:46.603
where he -- he basically just
takes a walk and records it.

18:46.647 --> 18:48.866
Every week I go somewhere
I've never been before.

18:48.910 --> 18:51.217
Bonus if it's far from a city
or there's a body of water.

18:51.260 --> 18:52.653
I just take a walk
with my microphone

18:52.696 --> 18:54.263
and talk about what I'm seeing,
and I post it online,

18:54.307 --> 18:55.699
and if people dig it,
that's cool,

18:55.743 --> 18:57.223
and if not, I have a record
of a nice day in my life.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.312
It's like, um -- I don't know,
like a meditation.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.835
- It kind of is.
- Yeah.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.228
Or it was.

19:02.271 --> 19:03.577
I stopped making episodes
after my last surgery

19:03.620 --> 19:05.274
because walking
was too painful,

19:05.318 --> 19:07.450
but I'm hoping that this surgery
lets me get back to it.

19:07.494 --> 19:09.800
Mr. Gomez, we'll be back to
prep you when the OR is ready.

19:09.844 --> 19:10.975
And it will be an honor.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.412
And a privilege.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.891
Never knew
I had a groupie.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.242
It's nice.

19:16.285 --> 19:17.895
It's nice to meet you,
Dr. Schmitt.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.070
Yes.

19:22.596 --> 19:23.858
Why aren't you
in pre-op?

19:23.901 --> 19:25.207
- They couldn't take him.
- Why?

19:25.251 --> 19:26.556
Is there a problem
with the equipment?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.471
I checked everything last night.
It looked fine.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.646
The equipment
is not the problem.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.691
David is the problem.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.127
Hamilton:
Dr. Bartley, I'm fine.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.389
If you were fine,

19:33.433 --> 19:34.390
you wouldn't be asking me
to keep it a secret.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.391
It's one degree.

19:35.435 --> 19:36.436
- Keep what secret?
- What?

19:36.479 --> 19:39.003
Fever.
He has a low-grade fever.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.267
99.6 is not a fever.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.399
99.6 is nerves.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.096
I am in charge
of this project.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.882
I am paying
your salaries --

19:47.925 --> 19:49.231
- Oh, my God.
- It's a cramp!

19:49.275 --> 19:52.495
Existential pain.
And I believed you!

19:52.539 --> 19:55.455
Existential pain,
my ass.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.196
- Ooh!
- Your abdomen is rock hard.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.371
He needs a CT.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.030
Megan, it's Teddy.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.989
I got the heart.
It's perfect.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.296
We're on our way back now.
It's going to be okay.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.168
I love you. Okay, bye.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.648
Farouk is prepped,

20:14.691 --> 20:16.998
and Winston's gonna bring him
up to the OR any minute.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.173
Megan's gonna be okay.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.435
Okay.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.352
It's a beautiful
and healthy heart.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.094
It's perfect.

20:28.096 --> 20:29.706
And for the record,
Megan does get help.

20:29.750 --> 20:30.925
She goes to therapy.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.361
She's living with us
while she's here and --

20:32.405 --> 20:34.407
When's the last time she
actually spent a night at home?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.322
'Cause every morning
when I'm doing pre-rounds,

20:36.365 --> 20:38.672
she's sitting there in that
uncomfortable chair in the PICU,

20:38.715 --> 20:40.282
looking like she hasn't
closed her eyes all night.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.852
Sir, are you okay?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.288
Teddy:
What's happening, Owen?

20:48.072 --> 20:48.986
He's passed out!

20:59.519 --> 21:01.869
Aah! Aah!
Oh, my God.

21:01.912 --> 21:02.957
Owen:
Teddy! Teddy!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.654
Yes. I'm fine!
I'm fine!

21:04.698 --> 21:06.047
There's --
Nothing's broken!

21:06.090 --> 21:07.353
Hayes?
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.573
Sir?

21:10.617 --> 21:13.097
Sir, sir?
Can you hear me?

21:13.141 --> 21:14.273
He has a blown pupil.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.578
He must have had
a massive stroke.

21:15.622 --> 21:16.797
- The cooler!
- I got it. I got it.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.407
- Okay.
- No cracks or dents.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.279
Alright, phones. We need --
We need to try to call for help.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.497
Yeah.

21:21.541 --> 21:22.977
Mine's --
Mine's no good.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.457
I can't get a signal.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.675
Alright, hang on.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.155
I got it.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.635
I-I have one bar.

21:28.678 --> 21:32.639
Let me try.
No, it won't go through.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.423
I got to try to figure out
how to get out

21:34.467 --> 21:35.903
and maybe find some better
reception or maybe --

21:35.946 --> 21:37.992
No, no, no. Wait, wait.
Don't move.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.646
We seem to be in a ditch.

21:39.689 --> 21:41.082
What?
Hayes, what can you see?

21:43.214 --> 21:44.999
Nobody bloody move.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.012
They're about 25 minutes out
with the heart,

21:58.055 --> 21:59.970
so we're going to get him on
the table and start immediately.

22:00.014 --> 22:01.232
Okay.

22:03.278 --> 22:05.193
Megan,
I-I think you should

22:05.236 --> 22:07.848
sit this one out
in the waiting room.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.763
She will.
I'll be with her.

22:09.806 --> 22:11.330
Okay.
Okay.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.686
Bye, baby.
I'll see you soon, okay?

22:23.429 --> 22:24.386
Okay.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.822
Alright, let's go.

22:35.832 --> 22:38.400
Hey, Mr. Gomez.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.620
Any questions before
we begin your anesthesia?

22:40.663 --> 22:42.883
Call me Devon.
And I'm ready.

22:42.926 --> 22:44.841
On Dasher, on Dancer,
right?

22:44.885 --> 22:48.149
Hey, would you mind if I listen
to your podcast while I operate?

22:48.192 --> 22:50.586
Most surgeons like to listen
to music while they work,

22:50.630 --> 22:52.936
but I always try to imagine
that I'm outside,

22:52.980 --> 22:56.244
not stuck under
these fluorescent lights.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.377
Keeps me grounded,
focused.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.466
Absolutely.
I'd be honored.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.382
Helm, he's ready.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.992
Okay, Devon.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.602
Here we go.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.474
Count backwards
from 10.

23:08.517 --> 23:14.871
10...9...8...7...

23:14.915 --> 23:16.917
<i>Hey, folks. </i>
Welcome to "On Foot."

23:16.960 --> 23:19.180
<i>Thanks for joining me </i>
on my walk today.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.182
<i>Uh, so my buddy told me </i>
there's a waterfall

23:21.225 --> 23:23.532
<i>about a quarter mile </i>
north of here.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.795
<i>Uh, let's make our way to it.</i>

23:27.231 --> 23:28.232
I'm gonna go scrub.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.498
Man:
Some cricoid pressure, please.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.501
Oh, wow.
It's Schmitt and Helm.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.590
Wow. Feels like
just yesterday

23:37.633 --> 23:40.114
he was dropping his glasses
into an abdomen.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.423
Uh, how are you
so calm?

23:44.466 --> 23:46.990
Schmitt's come
a long way.

23:47.034 --> 23:47.904
They all have.

23:49.689 --> 23:52.256
Oh. Perez is getting ready
to do his endoloop

23:52.300 --> 23:54.955
for his appy in OR 5.

23:54.998 --> 23:57.261
That is insane.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.785
I-I mean,
not literally.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.482
You know,
just exciting.

24:00.526 --> 24:02.310
Wow.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.703
Wow.

24:05.792 --> 24:06.967
Aha.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.708
Any observations,
Dr. Bailey?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.666
No. No, no.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.407
You're doing great.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.018
As a matter of fact,
flawless.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.544
Thank you, and next, I'll walk
down this dissection inferiorly.

24:20.197 --> 24:23.200
Dr. Wright, clearly, this isn't
your first sigmoidectomy.

24:23.244 --> 24:27.074
Oh, no, no, no, I've done
probably 40, give or take.

24:27.117 --> 24:31.426
Trust me when I say
I'm happier here in the OR

24:31.470 --> 24:33.472
than at my desk
doing paperwork,

24:33.515 --> 24:37.214
but your work
is thorough

24:37.258 --> 24:39.695
and your technique
is at an expert level.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.741
Before every surgery,
I sketch it.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.221
I draw the anatomy and I draw
what I will do to it.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.875
I even sketch out
every step

24:45.919 --> 24:47.877
and even every possible
complication,

24:47.921 --> 24:49.749
and then I will draw
the solutions.

24:49.792 --> 24:52.360
You're right. I do know this
surgery from start to finish.

24:52.403 --> 24:54.405
Then why didn't you want
to do it on your own?

24:56.538 --> 24:58.105
I study every move
my attendings make

24:58.148 --> 24:59.759
so I can anticipate
what they need.

24:59.802 --> 25:03.023
I'm not here to learn
this surgery, Dr. Bailey.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.503
I'm here to learn you.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.071
Then carry on.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.553
But I prefer blunt dissection
when you're in this area,

25:11.597 --> 25:13.903
just so you know.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.862
Thank you, Dr. Bailey.

25:18.081 --> 25:21.607
Okay, Wilson, one hand
by the fetus's head,

25:21.650 --> 25:23.391
the other one
by the buttocks.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.349
Lower. Good.
Okay.

25:25.393 --> 25:29.266
Now push down and try the
forward somersault technique.

25:30.746 --> 25:31.878
I am so sorry!

25:31.921 --> 25:32.966
You were doing it right.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.881
Sylvia, I know
this is uncomfortable,

25:34.924 --> 25:37.274
but if you still want
to have a vaginal birth,

25:37.318 --> 25:39.407
we need to try
and turn the baby around, okay?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.191
Okay.
Wilson?

25:41.235 --> 25:42.192
Okay.

25:43.629 --> 25:45.152
Should we try more gel?

25:45.195 --> 25:46.588
No, it's --

25:46.632 --> 25:48.155
Uh, yeah.
We'll take a break.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.460
Oh, thank God.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.248
I swear part of OB
is just torturing women.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.641
Did you talk to Amelia?

25:55.684 --> 25:56.859
When I was going
to Minnesota,

25:56.903 --> 25:58.295
I knew exactly
what I was gonna say,

25:58.339 --> 25:59.427
but now that
I'm in Seattle --

25:59.470 --> 26:00.384
The city
makes a difference?

26:00.428 --> 26:01.864
Just listen.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.869
I love you.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.698
I love you so much,

26:09.742 --> 26:12.222
and nothing else matters to me
except you and Scout.

26:12.266 --> 26:14.268
You two are my life,

26:14.311 --> 26:15.922
and I don't care about
being married anymore.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.750
I just need you.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.317
And I'm sorry it took me so long
to see it from your side.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.015
But I'm not perfect.
Neither are you.

26:22.058 --> 26:25.627
We -- We've both made mistakes,
but now we're both here,

26:25.671 --> 26:30.153
perfect for each other
at the right time.

26:30.197 --> 26:33.069
I love you now
and I have always loved you.

26:33.113 --> 26:34.680
So let's be together.
Let's try.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.812
However it needs to be,
however it works,

26:36.856 --> 26:38.988
let's be together
right now.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.472
Something like that?

26:44.515 --> 26:45.865
Uh-huh.

26:45.908 --> 26:47.954
Yeah, it's, um...

26:47.997 --> 26:49.782
It's perfect.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.871
Okay.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.177
Okay, thanks.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.962
I'm gonna go find her.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.274
Did you read the
research Dr. Bartley provided

27:04.318 --> 27:07.190
about the relationship
between anxiety, stress,

27:07.234 --> 27:08.627
and Parkinson's pain?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
Multiple articles
have been written.

27:10.846 --> 27:13.370
They are very interesting.
Please stay still.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.459
I-I'm merely suggesting
that the abdominal pain

27:15.503 --> 27:16.722
could be psychosomatic.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.638
And I'm merely suggesting
you stay still.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.642
We have a 72-hour window
the FDA has provided us

27:23.685 --> 27:25.600
to get this surgery
accomplished.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.994
David, I swear to God.

27:28.037 --> 27:30.257
Hamilton:
I'm holding still.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.738
He lied to you about his pain
on the day of a surgery

27:32.781 --> 27:35.044
that has cost him
tens of millions of dollars.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.481
- Who does that?
- He's stubborn
and he doesn't want a setback.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.268
Free air.
His bowel's perfed.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.661
We need to do
an immediate ex lap.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.663
So that's it.
We're -- We're done.

27:44.706 --> 27:45.925
We're not done.

27:45.968 --> 27:47.927
We can't inject the cells
in the FDA window --

27:47.970 --> 27:49.624
not if he needs
an emergent surgery.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.322
The impact of the anesthesia
alone is...

27:52.366 --> 27:55.238
Okay, so we'll get a new window
from the FDA.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.805
So we're not done,
we're delayed.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.981
I've had
enough patients to know

27:59.025 --> 28:01.114
the results should be in
by now.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.727
Teddy:
They'll try to contact us,

28:05.771 --> 28:07.511
and then when they
don't hear from us,

28:07.555 --> 28:09.862
they'll send a rescue unit.
We just have to wait.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.515
No, we can't wait.
Not if we want to save Farouk.

28:11.559 --> 28:13.692
By the time they get here,
that heart won't be viable.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.258
Ah!

28:15.302 --> 28:18.218
Hayes, can you --
can you open your window?

28:18.261 --> 28:19.610
No, it's not working.

28:19.654 --> 28:21.003
Okay.
Let me see.

28:21.047 --> 28:23.310
Hold on. Hold on.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.355
- Okay, let me see.
- What do you have?

28:25.399 --> 28:28.228
Okay, okay.
Use this.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.186
Use that end
to smash the bottom.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.753
It'll shatter the glass,
okay?

28:31.797 --> 28:33.146
- Okay.
- Hit it hard. Don't tap.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.321
Cover your eyes.
Yep.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.066
You okay?
Okay, good.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.632
Hayes, you go,
and we'll follow,

28:41.676 --> 28:42.808
unless somebody
has a better plan.

28:42.851 --> 28:45.288
- Okay. Take this.
- Okay.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.550
I'm gonna go on three,
okay?

28:46.594 --> 28:48.509
Ready?
One, two...

28:48.552 --> 28:51.555
Aah! Aah!

28:58.954 --> 29:01.478
Okay, don't -- don't -- don't --
don't move! Don't move.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.002
Okay, they must have
put out a distress call.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.568
- Somebody's coming.
- When?

29:04.612 --> 29:06.048
- I don't know.
- So what, we just do nothing
until then?

29:06.092 --> 29:07.702
I don't --
I don't know, Teddy.

29:07.746 --> 29:08.834
How will they even know
where to look?

29:08.877 --> 29:10.183
I don't know!

29:10.226 --> 29:11.706
I don't have answers
right now,

29:11.750 --> 29:13.447
but they must know
that we're in this area,

29:13.490 --> 29:15.057
so somebody will be coming
to find us.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.843
What we can do, all we can do
is try to stay alive till then.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.235
No, that's not all
we can do.

29:19.279 --> 29:20.976
We're here
because a child died

29:21.020 --> 29:24.240
and the family had the grace
to give this heart to us.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.026
We're here for Farouk,
so this car may fall,

29:27.069 --> 29:29.637
but we cannot
let this heart fall.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.943
We've got
about three hours

29:30.986 --> 29:32.509
before this heart
stops being viable,

29:32.553 --> 29:34.163
so two of us
are gonna stay in the car.

29:34.207 --> 29:36.122
Lean on opposite sides,
that'll stabilize the weight.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.732
One of us can climb out
with the cooler.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.038
What about the other two?

29:39.081 --> 29:41.127
Stay in the car
and wait till help comes.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.345
Well, Teddy
should go first.

29:42.389 --> 29:43.869
She can climb out,
take the heart,

29:43.912 --> 29:45.784
flag down a car,
and call for help, okay?

29:45.827 --> 29:47.655
Owen,
he's a single parent.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.266
His kids have already
lost their mother.

29:50.310 --> 29:51.877
Listen, he goes
and this car slips,

29:51.920 --> 29:53.966
then our kids
lose both their parents.

29:54.009 --> 29:56.098
Look, we've all got kids
we want to be there for.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.708
We all have lives
we want to keep,

29:57.752 --> 30:00.102
so we're all getting out
of this car alive.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.364
Just need to --

30:01.408 --> 30:02.583
Wait, wait, wait!
Nobody move.

30:02.626 --> 30:04.628
Do you hear that?

30:04.672 --> 30:05.891
I think the car's pulling
the tree out of the ground.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.676
What? Aah! Aah!

30:10.156 --> 30:13.072
Hey, I just watched Perez
ask a scrub nurse

30:13.115 --> 30:15.248
whether he should use
2-oh Vicryl or 3-oh Vicryl

30:15.291 --> 30:16.858
- to close an appy.
- Better her than us.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.686
When was the last time
you did an appy?

30:18.729 --> 30:21.036
I go away for a few weeks,
now the residents are attending?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.864
This place falls apart
without you.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.735
I almost just had a panic attack
in the gallery just now.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.128
How is Bailey
okay with this?

30:26.172 --> 30:27.042
It's progress, Maggie.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.478
The residents are excited

30:28.522 --> 30:30.263
in a way they have not been
in a long time.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.352
You plan on letting them
cut into brains without you?

30:32.395 --> 30:34.093
- Oh, absolutely not.
- Yeah.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.964
I --
What are you doing here?

30:36.008 --> 30:38.358
I thought you had your big,
super-secret surgery today?

30:38.401 --> 30:39.968
I did,
and then I didn't,

30:40.012 --> 30:41.883
so I thought I would find you
and tell you about my new crush,

30:41.927 --> 30:44.277
but somehow the vibe
does not feel right.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.495
I'm -- I'm gonna
find you later.

30:45.539 --> 30:46.627
Yeah.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.239
You can't report this
to the FDA.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.806
Just repair the bowel

30:51.850 --> 30:53.982
and tell them we had
an equipment malfunction.

30:54.026 --> 30:55.810
I cannot lie to the FDA.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.203
I'm gonna
tell them everything,

30:57.246 --> 30:58.682
and they'll just give us
a new window.

30:58.726 --> 30:59.945
Do you know how long
that will take?

30:59.988 --> 31:01.294
I'll lose weeks!

31:01.337 --> 31:03.339
You're a rule-breaker, Grey,
so break the rules!

31:03.383 --> 31:04.993
I cannot compromise
this project.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.648
You're compromising my only
chance at getting my life back.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.432
You're not the only one
with Parkinson's.

31:09.476 --> 31:10.999
There are
10 million people

31:11.043 --> 31:13.088
living around the world
with this disease.

31:13.132 --> 31:16.570
They don't have your money
or your access to healthcare.

31:16.613 --> 31:18.354
They still live.
They travel.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.356
They spend time
with their families.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.836
They work
as long as they can.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.490
Their lives
are as productive

31:23.533 --> 31:25.187
and as meaningful
as anyone else's.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.059
The only thing stopping you
from living with this disease

31:27.102 --> 31:29.496
is your own ego.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.889
Is that what you said
to your mother?

31:30.932 --> 31:32.934
What does my mother
have to do with this?

31:32.978 --> 31:34.240
Oh, come on, Meredith.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.851
If our procedure
is even a little successful,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.940
it'll have
huge ramifications

31:38.984 --> 31:40.855
for the treatment of other
neurodegenerative diseases.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.465
The funding will pour in.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.772
You know that.

31:44.815 --> 31:47.296
You never wanted
to cure <i>me.</i>

31:47.340 --> 31:49.559
You want
to cure Alzheimer's.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.086
<i>You know, this is </i>
my favorite time of day.

31:54.129 --> 31:56.305
<i>The sun burns the fog </i>
that settled overnight,

31:56.349 --> 31:58.438
<i>so there's water vapor...A little more traction.</i>

31:58.481 --> 31:59.569
Okay.
I get it.

31:59.613 --> 32:01.397
His footsteps
are like ASMR,

32:01.441 --> 32:02.529
which puts people
to sleep.

32:02.572 --> 32:03.965
You really
shouldn't play this

32:04.009 --> 32:05.749
while your hands
are in someone's body.

32:05.793 --> 32:06.750
And when you're
lead surgeon,

32:06.794 --> 32:08.100
you can choose.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.275
Suction. <i>And you look up,</i>

32:09.318 --> 32:10.276
<i>and the light </i>
hitting the leaves

32:10.319 --> 32:11.320
<i>looks like stained glass.</i>

32:11.364 --> 32:12.974
Okay.

32:13.018 --> 32:14.758
Page Dr. Webber, please.

32:14.802 --> 32:18.588
<i> And walking through it is just, </i>
well, so peaceful.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.895
Dr. Schmitt,
according to the method,

32:20.939 --> 32:23.724
we are supposed to wait
to continue until he arrives.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.856
This dissection is routine
for me at this point.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.207
I'll get it started,
and Webber will be here soon.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.513
<i>So wherever you are listening,</i>

32:30.557 --> 32:33.038
<i>I hope that you're feeling </i>
this peace, too.

32:33.081 --> 32:35.997
I should have put on the holiday
one from last season.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.433
He trudges
through the snow.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.652
He's bleeding.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.827
From where?

32:39.870 --> 32:42.047
Aah!

32:42.090 --> 32:44.136
I can't see! Suction!

32:44.179 --> 32:46.138
Where is it?
Where is it?!

32:53.841 --> 32:55.016
We don't have much time.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.149
Altman, tell my kids
to call their aunt.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.325
Tell them I love them.
Tell them they'll be okay.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.243
Listen.
We'll stabilize the car.

33:04.286 --> 33:06.071
Just get back to the road
and bring help.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.424
I love you.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.904
I love you. Go.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.127
Okay.

33:21.347 --> 33:22.652
Okay.

33:23.871 --> 33:25.438
I'm out. I'm out.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.396
Get the cooler.
Save Farouk.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.925
Teddy, go!

33:48.635 --> 33:49.679
Hey.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.942
He's headed
into surgery now.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.553
How long will it take?

33:53.596 --> 33:55.685
A few hours.
Depends.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.340
Look, I know this complication
is frustrating,

33:58.384 --> 34:02.170
but we made it this far,
and it's still gonna happen.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.129
How can you be so sure?

34:05.391 --> 34:07.393
- Close your eyes.
- Why?

34:10.787 --> 34:12.702
Fine.

34:16.358 --> 34:19.970
You are on Peaks Island

34:20.014 --> 34:22.886
off the coast of Maine
in late summer.

34:22.930 --> 34:25.150
You're standing
on the beach,

34:25.193 --> 34:27.935
which is also surrounded

34:27.978 --> 34:31.460
by huge, amazing trees.

34:31.504 --> 34:36.074
It's nighttime, so it's cool,
but the breeze is warm.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.121
And when you look up...

34:40.165 --> 34:42.906
stars...

34:42.950 --> 34:45.344
forever and ever.

34:47.868 --> 34:50.827
Hearing the waves...

34:50.871 --> 34:52.090
a calm exists...

34:55.093 --> 34:57.660
...like no other.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.669
Did you just
guide-mediate me?

35:08.062 --> 35:10.847
Did it work?

35:10.891 --> 35:12.414
It didn't <i>not</i> work.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.202
- Irrigation.
- Irrigation.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.856
Dr. Michael:
Urgent page from OR 4.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.249
They're calling
anyone available.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.686
- Anyone?
- Any attending.

36:06.729 --> 36:08.166
Go ahead.
I'm good to close up.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.210
Okay.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.606
Dr. Grey!
He's hypotensive!

36:20.308 --> 36:22.789
<i>Okay. </i>
It's definitely close.

36:22.832 --> 36:25.226
<i>I can hear the water. </i>
It's getting louder, and...

36:27.750 --> 36:29.752
<i>I think we'll be there soon, </i>
folks.

36:29.796 --> 36:32.712
Initiate the massive transfusion
protocol, right now!

36:32.755 --> 36:34.017
I'm coming down!

36:51.034 --> 36:52.384
<i>Yeah, I think...</i>

36:52.427 --> 36:54.690
<i>Ah! Ah, there it is.</i>

36:54.734 --> 36:56.518
<i>Holy moly.</i>

36:56.562 --> 36:59.086
<i>Holy moly. Wow!</i>

37:02.655 --> 37:06.049
<i>It's been so long since I've </i>
seen a waterfall in person.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.747
<i>Oh, this is just the best.</i>

37:07.790 --> 37:09.705
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna stay here </i>
a while, you guys.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.316
- <i>I'm gonna stay here a while.
- Turn that off.</i>

37:21.543 --> 37:23.980
I need to know
what happened, now.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.335
We were doing
the dissection.

37:30.378 --> 37:32.685
Everything looked good.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.557
Uh, Dr. Schmitt put traction
on the IMA.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.559
Why did you not call
for an attending?

37:37.603 --> 37:40.170
We did,
but, um, Levi --

37:40.214 --> 37:45.915
Dr. Schmitt started the
dissection instead of waiting.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.309
He thought he could
just get it started,

37:48.353 --> 37:51.181
but then
there was a bleed.

37:51.225 --> 37:53.445
Uh, Dr. Schmitt identified
it was coming

37:53.488 --> 37:58.058
from the base of the IMA
at the aorta.

37:58.101 --> 38:01.931
We attempted to control it,
but, um, it was too late.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.289
Schmitt?

38:12.942 --> 38:14.074
Call it.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.821
The time of death --No. You call it, Schmitt.

38:21.864 --> 38:26.826
This is your patient, your OR,
your hands that operated.

38:26.869 --> 38:28.784
Call it.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.497
Levi:
Time of death, 1:19.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.328
Meredith:
<i>I often ask my kids...</i>

38:51.981 --> 38:54.941
<i> ...do they prefer Christmas Eve </i>
or Christmas Day?

38:54.984 --> 38:55.985
Bailey:
This is on you.

38:57.117 --> 38:59.249
<i>I go back and forth </i>
on that question.

39:07.954 --> 39:11.131
<i>As a person, </i>
I prefer Christmas Eve,

39:11.174 --> 39:14.003
<i> when life is all possibility...</i>

39:14.047 --> 39:17.920
<i>falling asleep with unopened </i>
presents under a tree,

39:17.964 --> 39:20.053
<i>filled with excitement </i>
for tomorrow.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.888
<i>But as a surgeon, </i>
I prefer Christmas Day...

39:31.847 --> 39:34.459
<i>...the point where possibility </i>
meets reality.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.043
Wait, wait! Stop!

39:56.176 --> 39:58.004
<i>You've tried your best.</i>

39:58.047 --> 39:59.962
<i>You call to close.</i>

40:00.006 --> 40:02.225
<i>You finish the surgery </i>
with the proper suture.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.707
Hayes, just go!

40:05.751 --> 40:07.796
Tell Teddy and Megan and my kids
that I love them.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.232
- And my mom.
- No, no.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.625
Tell them I love them all
so much.
Absolutely not!

40:10.669 --> 40:12.801
No child deserves to grow up
without a parent.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.325
- I'm not listening.
- I'll be right behind you!

40:15.369 --> 40:17.327
When the car tips,
there'll be a few seconds.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.981
- I might just make it.
- No, the weight won't be enough.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.722
- We can go together.
- It won't work.
It won't work.

40:20.766 --> 40:24.639
You're closest to the window.
This is the only way, okay?

40:24.683 --> 40:25.771
I'm not leaving you.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.033
Think of your kids,
Hayes, okay?

40:27.076 --> 40:28.251
Please.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.429
If I don't make it,
just --

40:31.472 --> 40:33.996
I need you to do something
for me, okay?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.651
I gave Noah Young the drugs
that he needed to die,

40:36.695 --> 40:38.479
and I promised him that
I would give the same drugs

40:38.523 --> 40:40.307
to three other
dying soldiers.

40:40.350 --> 40:43.049
It's the right thing
to do, Hayes.

40:43.092 --> 40:44.180
I already have the meds.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.965
They're in my truck,
glove compartment.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.315
Call Noah's wife,
Heather.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.882
She has their names.
She'll help you, okay?

40:49.925 --> 40:50.926
<i>And soon...</i>

40:50.970 --> 40:52.101
Okay?!

40:52.145 --> 40:53.407
<i> ...you'll see if it all worked.</i>

40:53.451 --> 40:55.496
Move.
Move before it takes us both!

40:55.540 --> 40:56.889
Move! Go!

40:56.932 --> 40:58.456
<i>But whichever you prefer...</i>

40:58.499 --> 41:00.153
Go!

41:00.196 --> 41:01.546
<i>...I can promise you this.</i>

41:01.589 --> 41:03.722
No!

41:03.765 --> 41:05.680
Hunt!

41:08.378 --> 41:12.731
<i>...eventually, </i>
the holiday is over.
