00:02.168 --> 00:03.253

[dog barks]

00:13.179 --> 00:15.598
- SNITCH!

00:15.682 --> 00:18.101
DID THEY FOLLOW YOU
FROM CHURCH?

00:18.184 --> 00:21.271
- NO. WHEN YOU RAN OFF,
THEY WERE STILL FIGHTING.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.605
- OHH...

00:22.689 --> 00:25.608
I HAD SOMETHING BORROWED
AND SOMETHING BLUE.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.612
I DIDN'T THINK MY SOMETHING OLD
WOULD BE MY DEAD HUSBAND.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.156
[phone rings]

00:31.239 --> 00:33.283
- OH, IT'S MY AGENT.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.118
BUT I'M NOT EVEN GONNA TAKE IT.

00:35.201 --> 00:37.787
THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT
<i>THIS</i> SITUATION IS.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.123
- YOU POOR THING.
YOU MUST BE IN SHOCK.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.624
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.626

[cell phone chime]

00:48.214 --> 00:50.091
- OH. YOU'RE GETTING A TEXT.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.343
- OH, WHY DID I TEACH THEM
TO TEXT?

00:52.427 --> 00:54.345
READ IT.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.972
- IT'S FROM FRED.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.682
"ELKA, PLEASE,
MY HEART IS BREAKING.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.185
LOL."
- LOL?

01:00.268 --> 01:03.396
- OH, HE THINKS IT MEANS
LOTS OF LOVE.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.317
OH, I FEEL TERRIBLE.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.236
I KEEP PICTURING HIM
STANDING AT THE ALTAR,

01:10.320 --> 01:14.657
LOOKING AT ME WITH
SO MUCH LOL.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.160
[chime]
- OH. IT'S MAX.

01:17.243 --> 01:21.331
"I'VE FALLEN...IN LOVE.
AND I CAN'T GET UP."

01:21.414 --> 01:23.291
- OH...MAX.

01:23.374 --> 01:26.127
HE'S THE ROSS
TO MY RACHEL.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.340
- YOU HAVE A VOICEMAIL TOO.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.008
- PLAY IT.

01:32.091 --> 01:35.011
- HEY, RUNAWAY BRIDE.
IT'S YOUR HUSBAND.

01:35.094 --> 01:38.181
FOR 40 YEARS, I'VE BEEN MISSING
TWO THINGS FROM CLEVELAND,

01:38.264 --> 01:41.976
YOU AND THE PASTRAMI
AT NATE'S.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.853
TO BE HONEST,

01:43.937 --> 01:46.231
YOU'RE BOTH A LITTLE FATTIER
THAN I REMEMBER.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.691
BUT HEY, KID,
YOU'RE STILL GORGEOUS.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.068
AND I LOVE YA.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.903
GIMME A BUZZ, BABY.

01:51.986 --> 01:54.197
- OH...BOBBY.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.492
I MISS HIS SUBTLE
SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.036
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

02:00.119 --> 02:01.538
- IT'S ALL TOO MUCH,

02:01.621 --> 02:03.832
AND I HAVE TO GET AWAY
SOMEWHERE TO THINK.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.542
- I HAVE GOT THE MOST
AMAZING NEWS.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.335
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.086
MY AGENT JUST BOOKED ME

02:09.169 --> 02:11.840
TO BE A GUEST ON THAT NEW
MORNING TALK SHOW,<i> THE CHATTER.</i>

02:11.923 --> 02:13.716
- THAT CHEESY RIP-OFF
OF <i> THE VIEW?</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:14.801
- IT'S NOT A RIP-OFF.

02:14.884 --> 02:17.679
IT'S THREE WOMEN DISCUSSING
VITAL ISSUES OF THE DAY.

02:17.762 --> 02:21.307
- HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT?
- WELL,<i> THE VIEW</i> HAS FOUR.

02:22.725 --> 02:23.935
AND THAT'S THE BEST PART.

02:24.018 --> 02:26.896
MY AGENT SAID THAT <i> THE CHATTER</i>
IS LOOKING FOR A FOURTH TOO.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.441
THIS COULD BE MY CHANCE TO GET
BACK ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.069
- I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE ALL GO TO NEW YORK?

02:33.152 --> 02:34.571
ELKA, THAT'LL GIVE YOU
TIME TO THINK!

02:34.654 --> 02:38.241
- JUST GET ME OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THEY COME AFTER ME.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.828
THEY'RE SLOW,
BUT THEY'LL BE HERE.

02:43.621 --> 02:45.915
- I STILL CAN'T
GET OVER IT.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.625
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
WANTS TO MARRY YOU,

02:47.709 --> 02:50.795
AND HERE I AM
WITHERING ON THE VINE.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.756
- VICTORIA MARRIED YOU.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.260
- IT NEVER HAPPENED.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.095
WE WILL NEVER SPEAK
ABOUT OUR WEDDING

02:59.178 --> 03:01.055
TO ANYONE
OUTSIDE OF THIS ROOM.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.766
I'M NOT YOUR WIFE.
YOU'RE NOT MY HUSBAND.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.436
- WELL, HOW COME I HAVE TO
BE THE HUSBAND?

03:06.519 --> 03:08.396
- I JUST SAID
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

03:08.479 --> 03:09.856
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO THE HUSBAND IS.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.109
- NO, BUT YOUR INSTINCT
WAS THAT I WAS THE HUSBAND.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.403
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ANYTHING I'M SAYING.

03:15.486 --> 03:18.948
- OH, YEAH, SURE, OF COURSE.
IT'S ALWAYS ME.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.660
- YEAH, YOU TWO DON'T SEEM
MARRIED AT ALL!

03:34.088 --> 03:37.467
{\an8}- WHY IS MY COFFEE MUG EMPTY?
IT'S TIPSY TUESDAY.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.227
{\an8}PLEASE MAKE
THE OTHERS TERRIBLE.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.857
{\an8}- VICTORIA
HAD BETTER BE GOOD.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.860
{\an8}SHE KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT
PRACTICE INTERVIEWING HER.

03:55.944 --> 03:59.739
{\an8}- MARRIED TWO DAYS,

WAS IN THE MIDWEST.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.472
{\an8}- I THINK YOU'RE THINKING
OF A DIFFERENT OHIO.

04:24.555 --> 04:28.476
{\an8}- SORRY, HON, BUT THE PRODUCERS
ARE LOOKING FOR A GAY ONE.

04:28.559 --> 04:31.938

STAND UP, HONEY.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.650
- YOU MUST BE A LEG MAN.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.778
- WELL, IT WASN'T HER
PERSONALITY

06:01.861 --> 06:04.989
I SAW FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.451
- YOU TWO MAKE A LOVELY...
ABOMINATION.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.244
- SHUT UP, LIBBY.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.080
JOY, YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

06:12.163 --> 06:13.831
BUT TWO LIPSTICKS?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.792
HOW DOES THAT WORK?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.628

06:18.711 --> 06:21.964
OOH...

ABOUT THE PERSONALITY.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.930
- JOY, WHAT TURNED YOU
OFF MEN?

06:29.013 --> 06:30.681
- WAS IT THE SMELL?

06:30.765 --> 06:34.227
- OR WAS IT THEIR UNGODLY
DEMAND FOR SEX IN THE MORNING?

06:34.310 --> 06:39.023
- WHAT WOMAN WANTS TO STARE DOWN
THAT BARREL BEFORE COFFEE?

06:40.900 --> 06:43.319
- JOY AND I HAVE SEX
IN THE MORNING ALL THE TIME.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.030
DON'T WE, BABY?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.616
- LOOK, WE WERE AT ELKA'S
BACHELORETTE PARTY,

06:48.699 --> 06:50.868
AND MELANIE MIXED DOG MEDICINE

06:50.952 --> 06:52.328
AND...

06:52.411 --> 06:54.872
AND...IF YOU REALLY
WANT A JUICY STORY,

06:54.956 --> 06:57.166
HER HUSBAND CAME BACK
FROM THE DEAD

06:57.250 --> 07:00.086
TO STOP HER GETTING MARRIED!

07:00.169 --> 07:01.712
- MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE

07:01.796 --> 07:03.673
I'M ON MY SECOND
BOTTLE OF COFFEE,

07:03.756 --> 07:05.341
BUT I WANT TO HEAR THAT!

07:05.424 --> 07:07.135
WE GOT TO GET HER UP THERE!

07:07.218 --> 07:08.511
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?
[applause]

07:08.594 --> 07:11.472
AND ONE MAN?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.313

- WE'LL MAKE ROOM.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.315
COME ON!

07:21.399 --> 07:24.152
- SO LET ME SEE
IF I'M FOLLOWING THIS.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.863
YOUR HUSBAND FAKED
HIS OWN DEATH

07:26.946 --> 07:29.073
AND HID FROM THE MOB,

07:29.157 --> 07:31.117
AND HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.871
- HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME.

07:34.954 --> 07:35.997
audience: AW!

07:36.080 --> 07:37.999
- YOU KNOW,
AS A LESBIAN THESPIAN,

07:38.082 --> 07:40.877
I TOO KNOW THE PAIN
OF A LIFE IN HIDING.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.046
- AND HE LEFT YOU ALL THAT
STOLEN LOOT TO LIVE ON?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.424
- YES. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.342
audience: OOH!

07:48.426 --> 07:50.887
- BUT WHY IS NO ONE BRINGING UP
THAT A MAN PLAYS DEAD

07:50.970 --> 07:52.346
FOR 40 YEARS,

07:52.430 --> 07:54.348
THEN HE EXPECTS HIS WOMAN
TO JUMP, HMM?

07:54.432 --> 07:55.892
- SHE HAS TO JUMP.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.728
IN THE EYES OF GOD,
SHE'S STILL MARRIED TO HIM.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.356
- YES. BUT I'M ALSO IN LOVE
WITH MAX AND FRED.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.193
[Melanie, alone]
OOH--

08:05.276 --> 08:06.777
REALLY? I MEAN, COME ON.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.198
IF EVER THERE WAS
AN OOH MOMENT...

08:10.281 --> 08:11.449
- SO...

08:11.532 --> 08:13.784
WHO ARE YOU GONNA CHOOSE,
PRETTY LADY?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.578
- OHH...

08:15.661 --> 08:18.039
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:18.122 --> 08:21.459
[giggling]

08:24.378 --> 08:25.755
OH!

08:25.838 --> 08:28.174
GOOD COFFEE!

08:36.307 --> 08:37.265
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.601
<i>PEOPLE</i> WANTS AN INTERVIEW.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.809
<i>ELLEN, CONAN, LENO--</i>

08:39.894 --> 08:41.604
OH, MY CAREER IS TAKING OFF.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.938
I ONLY WISH I HAD BEEN
BRAVE ENOUGH

08:43.022 --> 08:45.942
TO COME OUT
A LONG TIME AGO.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.318
OH, GOD, I LOVE YOU.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.737
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

08:49.820 --> 08:51.113
I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.740
AND I'M NEVER SPEAKING
TO YOU AGAIN.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.825
- OH. MY LITTLE
SPITFIRE.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.621
THAT'S WHAT I'LL CALL HER
ON <i> LENO.</i>

09:02.291 --> 09:05.086
- BOBBY--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:05.169 --> 09:07.546
- I'M YOUR HUSBAND.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.591
HEY, YOU TWO,

09:10.675 --> 09:13.594
HOW MANY LESBIANS DOES IT TAKE
TO MAKE ME A SANDWICH?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.849
YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU CALL THIS A PICKLE?

09:18.933 --> 09:21.477
NO WONDER
YOU CAN'T GET A MAN!

09:21.560 --> 09:23.813
- IT'S NOT THAT I CAN'T
GET A MAN, IT'S--

09:23.896 --> 09:25.815
OH, NEVER MIND.

09:25.898 --> 09:26.816
- [British accent]
CHEERIO!

09:26.899 --> 09:29.986
- NOW I KNOW WHY THE MOB
WANTS TO KILL THAT GUY.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.488
- THAT'S MY HUSBAND
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.406
- FOR NOW.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.491
WE ARE STILL GOING OVER
THE PROS AND CONS

09:35.574 --> 09:37.034
OF MAX, FRED, AND BOBBY.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.494
- YEAH, WELL, I WOULD
CHOOSE FRED.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.830
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THAT ADORABLE FACE.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.832
- OH, MY FREDDY BEAR.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.166
- REALLY?

09:44.250 --> 09:46.002
I CHOOSE MAX.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.129
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A CRUSH
ON HIM MYSELF.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.672
- HE'S ALL MAN.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.009
WELL, EXCEPT FOR HIS HIP.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.303
TITANIUM.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.682
- MORE WINE, DARLING?
HOW--HOW MANY IS THAT?

09:59.765 --> 10:00.891
- I NEED THIS.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.852
I'VE HAD A <i> VERY</i>
STRESSFUL DAY.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.521
- YEAH, WELL, I WOULD
GO EASY ON THAT.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.815
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.494
- SO...

10:20.578 --> 10:21.620
WHO WOULD YOU CHOOSE?

10:21.704 --> 10:25.166
- WELL, I THINK BOTH MAX
AND FRED ARE WONDERFUL GUYS.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.502
LOOK AT HOW MANY GOOD QUALITIES
YOU HAVE LISTED FOR THEM.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.880
ALL YOU HAD FOR BOBBY IS
ALREADY MARRIED

10:30.963 --> 10:32.214
AND FUNNY.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.051
- WHY DIDN'T YOU WRITE DOWN
HOT, HOT, HOT?

10:35.134 --> 10:38.721
- 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE JOKING.

10:38.804 --> 10:42.099
- WOMEN FIND HIM SCRUMPTIOUS!

10:42.183 --> 10:44.060
- HIM.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.687
- HOT, HOT, HOT.
WRITE IT DOWN.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.065
- EVEN IF YOU DO FIND BOBBY
HOT, HOT, HOT,

10:49.148 --> 10:50.566
I SAY CROSS HIM OFF.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.109
HE FAKED HIS DEATH
FOR 40 YEARS.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.527
HE WON'T EVEN TELL YOU
WHERE HE WAS!

10:53.611 --> 10:55.446
- YEAH.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.198
CROSS OFF THE FIRST HOT.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.408
- AND HE DIDN'T COME BACK
WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.160
HE ONLY CAME BACK
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT

11:01.243 --> 11:02.745
YOU MIGHT BE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.705
YOU PRACTICALLY
WENT TO PRISON.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.582
- YEAH.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.209
CROSS OFF THE SECOND HOT.

11:08.292 --> 11:11.754
- AND HE CHEATED ON YOU
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.091
HE HAD A SON YOU NEVER
EVEN KNEW ABOUT.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.885
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

11:17.968 --> 11:20.930
CROSS OFF FUNNY!

11:24.141 --> 11:25.393
- ELKA.

11:27.311 --> 11:30.898
- OKAY. I'LL TELL HIM
IT'S ALL OVER.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.108
[cell phone chimes]

11:32.191 --> 11:34.402
- [gasps]

11:34.485 --> 11:37.238
MARTIN SCORSESE
SAW ME ON <i> THE CHATTER.</i>

11:37.321 --> 11:39.156
HE WANTS TO HAVE
A MEETING WITH ME

11:39.240 --> 11:41.742
TO DISCUSS A CHARACTER
HE'S DEVELOPING--

11:41.826 --> 11:44.412
A WOMAN WHO DISCOVERS HER
TRUE SEXUALITY LATER IN LIFE.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.790
THAT IS MY STORY!

11:47.873 --> 11:51.836
- IS THIS CHARACTER
ALSO AN IDIOT?

11:55.548 --> 11:59.593
- I'M SORRY.
I JUST CAN'T GO WITH YOU.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.389
SO...I GUESS
THIS IS GOOD-BYE.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.769
- DIDN'T YOU USED TO BE
A BLOND?

12:08.853 --> 12:12.690
- DIDN'T YOU USED TO BE
SOMETHING?

12:12.773 --> 12:15.943
- IT'S HAPPENING...
ISN'T IT?

12:16.026 --> 12:18.779
THE HEAT.

12:18.863 --> 12:21.115
- I'M ON FIRE.

12:21.198 --> 12:24.535
- I COULD ROAST MARSHMALLOWS
OVER HERE.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.122
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

12:28.205 --> 12:31.125
- EVERYTHING!

12:31.208 --> 12:34.628
- DAMN YOU, YOU BALD
ANCIENT ADONIS!

12:34.712 --> 12:37.047
- [groans/mutters]

12:41.260 --> 12:45.014
[silver clinking]

12:45.097 --> 12:47.558
- ENOUGH WITH THE STIRRING!

12:47.641 --> 12:50.186
WHY IS IT EVER SINCE
WE GOT MARRIED

12:50.269 --> 12:51.854
EVERYTHING YOU DO ANNOYS ME?

12:51.937 --> 12:54.190
- BECAUSE EVER SINCE
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED,

12:54.273 --> 12:57.693
YOU HAVE BEEN A NEEDY
LITTLE [mutters] BITCH.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.028
- WHAT DID YOU JUST
CALL ME?

12:59.111 --> 13:02.072
- STOP IT, YOU GUYS!
I HATE IT WHEN YOU FIGHT.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.408
- OH, SEE?
NOW YOU'VE UPSET MELANIE.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.036
[dog barking]

13:07.119 --> 13:09.038
- WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US?

13:09.121 --> 13:12.041
THIS MARRIAGE IS RUINING
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.710
- HEY, BOY!

13:14.793 --> 13:18.297
"SEND MORE BATH OIL."
ELKA.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.383
MORE? SHE AND BOBBY HAVE
BEEN MARINATING IN THAT TUB

13:21.467 --> 13:23.177
FOR DAYS!

13:23.260 --> 13:25.221
- WELL, I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE AS
WRINKLED AS BOBBY,

13:25.304 --> 13:28.724
IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW LONG
YOU'VE BEEN IN THE WATER.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.726
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE CHOSE BOBBY.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.603
- I THOUGHT FOR SURE
SHE'D CHOOSE MAX.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.897
- WELL, YOU CAN'T COMPETE
WITH FIRST LOVES.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.024
I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN ROMANTICIZING
THIS RELATIONSHIP

13:37.107 --> 13:39.026
FOR OVER 40 YEARS.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.403
- YEAH. OBVIOUSLY,
THE CHEMISTRY'S STILL THERE.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.949
I MEAN, WE'VE ALL DONE
CRAZY THINGS FOR GREAT SEX.

13:45.032 --> 13:48.827
- I MISS DOING CRAZY THINGS
FOR GREAT SEX.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.621
- AW, DON'T BE SAD.

13:50.704 --> 13:55.084
HOW ABOUT I TAKE YOU OUT LATER
AND BUY YOU SOMETHING PRETTY?

13:55.167 --> 13:56.794
- THAT'D BE NICE.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.297
- OKAY, THIS...
WEIRD.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.553
- GUYS,

14:05.636 --> 14:08.055
I CAME OVER TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.099
- OH, NO.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.600
- BOBBY AND I ARE LEAVING
IN AN HOUR.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.103
- SERIOUSLY--YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE CLEVELAND

14:14.186 --> 14:15.604
AND GO ON THE LAM
WITH BOBBY?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.606
- COULDN'T BOBBY HIDE HERE
FROM THE MOB?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.442
- OH, HE'D ALWAYS BE
LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.946
AND WITH HIS BURSITIS,
THAT'D BE VERY PAINFUL.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.949
- WELL, WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
BE HIDING?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.909
- I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.120
THAT'S WHAT HIDING MEANS.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.789
- ELKA, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

14:33.872 --> 14:35.916
- IT'S A REALLY BIG STEP.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.002
- AND WE'RE REALLY
GONNA MISS YOU.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.379
- OH, I'M SURE YOU WILL.

14:41.797 --> 14:44.133
AND NOW I'D BETTER GO...

14:44.216 --> 14:47.511
[crying]
BEFORE YOU THREE START CRYING.

14:56.770 --> 14:59.607
- JOY, COME ON.
THE TAXI'S WAITING.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.651
WAIT--IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING?

15:02.735 --> 15:06.488
IT'S SCORSESE,
NOT "SCORES EASY."

15:09.033 --> 15:12.202
ELKA GAVE ME THAT ONE
BEFORE SHE LEFT.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.038
- THERE'S NOTHING INAPPROPRIATE
ABOUT THIS.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.498
IT'S FINE.
- IF WE WERE COURTING, SURE.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.000
BUT I ALREADY BOUGHT THE COW.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.461
YOU DON'T NEED TO
GIVE AWAY THE MILK.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.922
- OH, MY GOD.
I MARRIED A WANKER.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.551
- HEY, GUYS, ELKA
LEFT ME A MESSAGE.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.678
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- IT'S WHAT SHE DOESN'T SAY.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.055
I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.557
- HEY, GIRLS,
I PROMISED I'D CALL,

15:33.641 --> 15:35.476
SO HERE'S MY CALL.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.479
BOBBY AND I
ARE VERY HAPPY.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.857
I MISS YOU ALL.
EVEN JOY.

15:41.940 --> 15:44.068
BYE.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.488
- WELL, SHE SOUNDS SWEET,
CONTENT, UPBEAT.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.948
- SEE? I TOLD YOU
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.076
- I AGREE.
"EVEN JOY"?

15:52.159 --> 15:54.536
CLEARLY,
IT'S A CRY FOR HELP!

15:54.620 --> 15:55.913
- WELL, I'M GONNA FIND HER,

15:55.996 --> 15:57.873
AND IF SHE'S AS MISERABLE
AS SHE'S NOT SOUNDING,

15:57.956 --> 15:59.166
CONVINCE HER TO COME HOME.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.834
- YOU'LL NEVER CONVINCE HER.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.378
YOU'RE A PUSHOVER
WHEN IT COMES TO ELKA.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.338
I'M THE ONE
WHO CAN DRAG HER HOME.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.423
- OH, YOU AND ELKA
WILL JUST FIGHT.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.717
NO, NO, ONCE AGAIN,
I HAVE TO COME ALONG

16:08.801 --> 16:10.886
AND BE THE VOICE OF REASON.

16:10.969 --> 16:14.556
JUST CALL SCORSESE
AND RESCHEDULE THE MEETING.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.350
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I JUST SAID THOSE WORDS.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.519
- IT'LL MAKE YOU SEEM
MORE IN DEMAND.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.647
- AH...THAT'S THE WOMAN
I MARRIED.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.899
- NO.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.531
IF SHE HAD TO HIDE OUT
IN THE SOUTHWEST,

16:30.614 --> 16:33.117
COULDN'T IT HAVE BEEN SEDONA
WHERE ALL THE NICE SPAS ARE?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.243
[woof]
- CHANCE!

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
WHERE'S ELKA?

16:35.994 --> 16:38.205
- HOW DID YOU GUYS FIND ME?

16:38.288 --> 16:40.290
- OH, WE WERE SEARCHING
THE GUEST HOUSE FOR CLUES

16:40.374 --> 16:42.918
WHEN I NOTICED YOU HAD WRITTEN
ON A PAD NEXT TO THE PHONE.

16:43.001 --> 16:45.421
SO I TOOK A PENCIL
AND I STARTED TO LIGHTLY SHADE

16:45.504 --> 16:47.548
OVER THE IMPRESSION,
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

16:47.631 --> 16:50.426
IT WAS A SOUVENIR PENCIL
FROM THE HAPPY SHOPPING GROUNDS!

16:50.509 --> 16:52.386
- SHH!

16:54.555 --> 16:56.807
DON'T LET HIM HEAR YOU.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.934
- LISTEN, WE DON'T WANT
TO BLOW YOUR COVER,

16:59.017 --> 17:00.477
BUT YOUR MESSAGE
REALLY WORRIED US.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.939
- OH! I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID I MISSED JOY.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.483
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:07.568 --> 17:09.444
- WELL...

17:09.528 --> 17:12.865
I JUST WANTED MY MARRIAGE
TO GO BACK THE WAY IT WAS.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.451
- BUT IT DIDN'T?
- NO, IT DID!

17:15.534 --> 17:18.662
I HAD JUST FORGOTTEN
THE WAY IT WAS.

17:18.746 --> 17:22.458
{\an1}OTHER THAN THE RAGING PASSION,
WE DON'T HAVE A THING IN COMMON.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.292
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEN COME BACK WITH US.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.963
I RENTED A PRIUS.
HE'LL NEVER EVEN HEAR US LEAVE.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.423
- I CAN'T.
HE'S MY HUSBAND...

17:29.506 --> 17:31.925
EVEN IF WE HAVE RUN OUT
OF THINGS TO SAY TO EACH OTHER

17:32.009 --> 17:33.677
IN FIVE DAYS.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.137
- WELL, THAT'S JUST SAD!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.973
- SAID THE WOMAN
IN THE FAKE GAY MARRIAGE?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.975
- WELL, AT LEAST
OUR FAKE MARRIAGE

17:40.058 --> 17:41.810
IS BASED ON FRIENDSHIP.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.645
I MEAN, SURE WE BICKER A BIT,

17:43.729 --> 17:45.647
AND JOY CAN BE
A LITTLE DEMANDING,

17:45.731 --> 17:47.816
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY
WE LAUGH

17:47.900 --> 17:49.485
AND WE LIKE EACH OTHER.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.153
- THANKS, VICTORIA.
THAT'S SWEET.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.948
AND DARLING, I'M SORRY
I'VE BEEN SO TOUCHY LATELY.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.659
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE GOOD.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.162
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.831
I'M ACTUALLY JEALOUS
OF YOU TWO.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.459
- ELKA, DON'T YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE THE TYPE OF MARRIAGE

18:05.542 --> 18:08.170
THESE TWO HAVE?

18:14.301 --> 18:17.346
- BOBBY, WE'VE GOTTA TALK.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.972
THIS ISN'T WORKING.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.350
- I KNOW.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.479
- WHATEVER WE HAD IS AS BURIED
AS I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.523
- IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

18:27.606 --> 18:31.401
- ALL WE HAD WAS...THE HEAT.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.736
I WILL MISS THAT.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.823
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHERE I AM.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.991
- MAYBE ONCE A YEAR?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.118
- SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
[chuckles]

18:40.202 --> 18:43.872
ANY CHANCE YOU'LL GET
ANY YOUNGER BY THEN?

18:45.415 --> 18:48.710
- THANKS FOR LEAVING ME
WITH A LAUGH.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.546
- LOVE YA, KID.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.464
- LOVE YOU TOO.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.220
RIGHT NOW I COULD BE
IN A HEART-SHAPED TUB

18:58.303 --> 19:00.055
IN THE POCONOS WITH FRED.

19:00.138 --> 19:02.057
- WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU AND BATHS?

19:02.140 --> 19:04.560
- I LIKE TO BE CLEAN.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.020
AND DIRTY
AT THE SAME TIME.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.148
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TAKE A BREAK

19:10.232 --> 19:11.358
FROM MEN FOR A WHILE.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.902
- NO. I'M NOT READY
TO SETTLE DOWN YET.

19:13.986 --> 19:17.114
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I LEARNED ON THE RESERVATION

19:17.197 --> 19:21.076
IT'S THAT WILD HORSES
CAN'T BE BROKEN.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.744
- WELL...

19:22.828 --> 19:24.913
AT LEAST YOU DIDN'T GET
MARRIED TO SOMEONE

19:24.997 --> 19:26.540
WHO'D LEAVE YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF A FLIGHT

19:26.623 --> 19:28.709
TO FLIRT WITH
PORTIA DE ROSSI.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.961
- OH, THIS AGAIN?
PORTIA IS MARRIED TO ELLEN.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.590
THEY'RE LESBIAN ROYALTY.
IT COULD HELP MY CAREER.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.758
- YOU KNOW,
EVER SINCE WE GOT MARRIED,

19:36.842 --> 19:39.177
THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR ABOUT--
<i>YOUR</i> CAREER!

19:39.261 --> 19:42.264
YOU NEVER THINK ABOUT ME.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.683
- WOMEN.
AM I RIGHT?
