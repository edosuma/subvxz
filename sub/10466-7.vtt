FOR HALF AN HOUR.

32:01.484 --> 32:03.443
I'D RATHER GO
BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.184
GREAT. AND THERE'S
A FEW OTHER THINGS,
TOO, ZOE.

32:05.184 --> 32:07.795
Zoe: WHAT OTHER THINGS?

32:07.795 --> 32:11.016
WELL, LIKE
SEATING ARRANGEMENTS,

32:11.016 --> 32:13.844
'CAUSE, UM...
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

32:13.844 --> 32:16.151
AND WE'VE KIND OF DECIDED
THAT WE DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.153
Zoe: YOU WANT PEOPLE
SITTING ALL OVER THE HOUSE?

32:18.153 --> 32:20.112
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THERE ARE TOASTS?

32:20.112 --> 32:21.635
Julia: WELL, THAT'S
THE OTHER THING.

32:21.635 --> 32:24.855
WE DECIDED NOT TO HAVE,
YOU KNOW, TOASTS.

32:24.855 --> 32:27.293
I JUST THINK IF YOU'RE
NOT GREETING GUESTS

32:27.293 --> 32:28.511
AND YOU'RE NOT SITTING DOWN

32:28.511 --> 32:29.817
AND YOU'RE NOT
HAVING TOASTS--

32:29.817 --> 32:31.079
THAT'S THE THING,
ALL THAT STUFF.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.080
I JUST--YOU SEE...

32:32.080 --> 32:33.995
I WANT THIS WEDDING

32:33.995 --> 32:36.128
TO FEEL LIKE, UM...
I WANT IT TO FEEL--

32:36.128 --> 32:37.999
BUT I'VE DONE THIS
BEFORE, GUYS,

32:37.999 --> 32:39.827
AND I KNOW
WHAT PEOPLE WANT,
AND THEY WANT--

32:39.827 --> 32:42.917
ZOE, ZOE. YOU KNOW,
IT'S THEIR WEDDING.

32:42.917 --> 32:46.399
CHARLIE. HAVE YOU
EVEN HEARD THE QUESTION?

32:46.399 --> 32:47.791
I DON'T CARE.
WHATEVER IT IS,

32:47.791 --> 32:49.576
IT'S UP TO MY SISTER
AND GRIFFIN.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.795
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR
WHAT THEY'RE THINKING?

32:51.795 --> 32:55.016
NO ONE'S GONNA MAKE THEM
FEEL BAD ABOUT WHAT
THEY WANT, ALL RIGHT?!

32:55.016 --> 32:56.670
CHARLIE, WHY ARE YOU--

32:56.670 --> 32:58.237
DIDN'T YOU HIRE ME
FOR MY EXPERIENCE?

32:58.237 --> 33:00.674
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST...

33:00.674 --> 33:03.242
LET'S JUST FORGET THIS,
ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE FIRED.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.112
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LEAVE?

33:30.660 --> 33:32.662
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

33:32.662 --> 33:33.576
Julia: CHARLIE?

33:37.537 --> 33:38.929
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]

33:38.929 --> 33:42.194
CHAR? CAN I COME IN?

33:42.194 --> 33:43.282
JUST A SEC.

33:47.721 --> 33:48.635
CHARLIE?

33:57.818 --> 33:59.385
JULE, I'M SORRY.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.214
NO.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.001
THANK YOU, CHARLIE.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.048
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:11.527 --> 34:12.398
THANK YOU.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.849
YOU HUNGRY AT ALL?

34:28.849 --> 34:30.633
THIRSTY?
YOU WANT ANYTHING?

34:30.633 --> 34:31.939
NO.

34:31.939 --> 34:32.896
JUST THIS.

34:42.863 --> 34:44.604
SO...

34:44.604 --> 34:46.084
WHAT DO WE TELL NATALIE?

34:47.563 --> 34:49.522
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

34:49.522 --> 34:54.135
'CAUSE HER SLEEP-OVER THERE,
SHE'S GONNA BE HOME SOON.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.223
WELL...

34:55.223 --> 34:57.573
WE TELL HER...

34:57.573 --> 34:59.532
I DON'T KNOW.

34:59.532 --> 35:02.012
WE TELL HER
WE'RE DATING,

35:02.012 --> 35:04.014
BUT WE TELL IT
TO HER REAL SLOW.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.105
THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

35:08.889 --> 35:10.934
BUT LET'S NOT TELL HER
TOO SLOW.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.505
WHY NOT?BECAUSE...

35:16.505 --> 35:19.117
THE WAY I SEE IT,
IT'S REALLY GOOD NEWS.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.820
I'M IMPRESSED.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.649
7 A.M., AND YOU'RE ALREADY
BREAKING DOWN BIKES.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.913
HEY, HOWIE.

35:32.913 --> 35:35.002
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING,
GRIFFIN.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.917
PRETTY SOON,
ALL THESE PEOPLE
ARE GONNA COME BACK

35:36.917 --> 35:38.179
WITH THEIR
BIG-TICKET JOBS,

35:38.179 --> 35:39.180
AND YOU'RE GONNA
RAKE IT IN.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.139
YOU THINK?

35:41.139 --> 35:42.749
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THIS IS?

35:42.749 --> 35:45.926
I HAD A CHANCE
TO HELP YOU OUT,
RIGHT?

35:45.926 --> 35:47.362
AND I DID.

35:47.362 --> 35:49.582
NOW YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO HELP ME OUT.

35:49.582 --> 35:50.974
JUST DON'T ASK ME
TO CHANGE YOUR OIL, MAN.

35:50.974 --> 35:53.151
I'M CLEAN OUT OF FILTERS.HA.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.631
NO, WHAT I MEAN IS,
UM...

35:55.631 --> 35:58.025
I'VE GOT SOME
OTHER THINGS GOING ON
BESIDE THE CLUB.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.288
SEE?
SOME IMPORT/EXPORT,

36:00.288 --> 36:02.029
STUFF THAT'S
OFF THE BOOKS.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.118
WHOA. BOY, YOU'RE
STARTING TO SCARE ME, MAN.

36:04.118 --> 36:06.251
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOT ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.296
I MEAN, IT'S NOT
DRUGS OR ANYTHING,

36:08.296 --> 36:09.819
BUT IT'S A CASH
BUSINESS, GRIFFIN,

36:09.819 --> 36:11.038
AND IT'S DOIN'
PRETTY GOOD,

36:11.038 --> 36:12.779
SO I NEED TO
FIND A PLACE

36:12.779 --> 36:14.084
TO PARK SOME PROFITS,
YOU KNOW?

36:14.084 --> 36:15.999
A NICE,
QUIET BANK ACCOUNT.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.786
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LIKE HIDE IT
FROM THE GOVERNMENT?

36:19.786 --> 36:22.223
IT'S JUST SOME DEPOSITS
AND WITHDRAWALS.

36:22.223 --> 36:25.357
NO BIG DEAL.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.273
YOU KNOW, THIS DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE SOMETHING
I WANT TO BE A PART OF.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.843
BUT THEN I GOTTA
ASK MYSELF,

36:33.843 --> 36:36.759
WHY DO I HELP
THIS KID ANYMORE?

36:36.759 --> 36:39.153
WHY DON'T I JUST
TAKE MY MONEY BACK
AND LEAVE?

36:39.153 --> 36:42.330
W-WAIT A MINUTE.
SO YOU'D ACTUALLY--

36:42.330 --> 36:44.332
I LIKE YOU, GRIFFIN.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.681
I WANT TO HELP YOU OUT.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.467
I WANT US
TO HELP EACH OTHER.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.337
DON'T YOU?

36:53.863 --> 36:55.561
Kirsten: CHARLIE?

36:58.259 --> 36:59.565
HI.

36:59.565 --> 37:00.827
KIRSTEN,
WHAT ARE YOU--

37:00.827 --> 37:02.263
I WAS JUST...

37:02.263 --> 37:03.177
I WAS JUST...

37:04.483 --> 37:05.571
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

37:05.571 --> 37:07.790
YEAH, YEAH, PLEASE.

37:07.790 --> 37:11.185
LISTEN, I HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THIS AND...

37:11.185 --> 37:14.536
THINKING ABOUT THIS,
AND I KIND OF...

37:14.536 --> 37:17.060
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT WE CAN COME
TO JULIA'S WEDDING.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.628
YOU...WHAT?

37:19.628 --> 37:22.022
I KNOW WHAT
I CAN HANDLE, CHARLIE,

37:22.022 --> 37:24.242
AND I KNOW WHAT I CAN'T,

37:24.242 --> 37:25.634
AND BEING AT THIS HOUSE
LIKE THAT,

37:25.634 --> 37:28.550
YOU KNOW, FOR LIKE...

37:28.550 --> 37:31.205
A WEDDING, I...

37:31.205 --> 37:33.120
I'LL TELL HER MYSELF
IF YOU THINK THAT
SHE'LL BE HURT.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.688
I JUST--I JUST WANTED TO
TELL YOU FIRST BECAUSE I...

37:36.993 --> 37:38.778
CHARLIE?

37:38.778 --> 37:40.083
IS THIS--

37:40.083 --> 37:41.520
ARE YOU--

37:41.520 --> 37:42.695
WHAT'S WRONG?

37:44.479 --> 37:46.481
I'M SICK, KIRSTEN.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.266
I'M...

37:48.266 --> 37:51.617
MAN, I'M JUST
REALLY, REALLY SICK.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.575
YOU'RE SI--

37:53.575 --> 37:55.273
I'VE GOT THIS...

37:57.013 --> 37:59.189
IT'S CALLED HODGKIN'S.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.366
OH, MY GOD.

38:03.063 --> 38:04.412
IT'S THIS CANCER, BUT...

38:04.412 --> 38:05.761
I KNOW.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.982
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

38:08.982 --> 38:11.071
AND THEY GAVE ME
THESE STATISTICS, YOU KNOW?

38:14.422 --> 38:18.426
AND ALL I CAN DO,
I KEEP LOOKING AT EVERYTHING,
AND I'M LIKE...

38:18.426 --> 38:20.907
WHAT'S 75% OF THAT TREE
OVER THERE?

38:20.907 --> 38:23.301
IS THAT A LOT?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.781
IS THAT A GOOD CHANCE?

38:27.696 --> 38:29.916
DOES THAT MEAN
I'M GONNA LIVE?

38:29.916 --> 38:31.831
OH, GOD.

38:35.051 --> 38:36.096
CAN I...

38:37.924 --> 38:38.925
GOD.

38:52.155 --> 38:53.069
WHAT?

38:55.985 --> 38:57.596
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD THEM?

38:57.596 --> 38:59.032
JULIA'S GETTING MARRIED
IN A WEEK.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.296
BUT WHAT ABOUT NINA?

39:02.296 --> 39:04.080
I'LL TELL THEM IN A WEEK.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.299
ALL RIGHT, KIRSTEN?
I WILL.

39:07.475 --> 39:08.824
GOD.

39:10.478 --> 39:12.088
GOD, CHARLIE, I DON'T...

39:19.139 --> 39:21.489
OH, OH, GRIFFIN,
YOU LIKE THIS ONE?

39:21.489 --> 39:22.664
UH, YEAH, SURE.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.362
ME, TOO.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.146
OH, WOW. YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:26.146 --> 39:27.626
I THINK....

39:27.626 --> 39:29.105
YEAH, THESE WERE
HAND-PAINTED IN ITALY.

39:29.105 --> 39:31.499
SOMEWHERE OFF
THE AMALFI COAST,
I THINK.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.632
HMM. YOU WANNA
GET THIS ONE?

39:33.632 --> 39:35.068
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.852
IT'S A LOT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.071
IT IS?

39:38.071 --> 39:39.986
YES. YES.
I READ ABOUT THIS.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.248
IF YOU'RE
GONNA REGISTER
FOR A WEDDING,

39:41.248 --> 39:42.597
YOU GOTTA THINK
ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

39:42.597 --> 39:44.686
YOU GOTTA
CHOOSE SOMETHING

39:44.686 --> 39:46.253
THAT'S A LITTLE PRICIER
THAN YOU WOULD NORMALLY
BUY FOR YOURSELF.

39:46.253 --> 39:47.994
OTHERWISE,
WHY BOTHER, RIGHT?

39:47.994 --> 39:49.430
LIKE THIS?

39:49.430 --> 39:51.301
WELL, EXCEPT IT CAN'T
BE SO EXPENSIVE

39:51.301 --> 39:53.129
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T
BUY YOU MORE THAN
2 OR 3 PIECES.

39:55.088 --> 39:58.526
WOW. LIKE THIS.RIGHT. EXACTLY.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.180
'CAUSE, OTHERWISE,
YOU GOTTA BUY THE REST
OF THE SET YOURSELF

40:00.180 --> 40:02.225
OR, WORSE,
YOU GOTTA RETURN IT

40:02.225 --> 40:04.489
FOR SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.012
OH?

40:06.012 --> 40:07.796
MM-HMM. YEAH. SO WHAT
WE NEED TO LOOK FOR

40:07.796 --> 40:09.102
IS SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE...

40:09.102 --> 40:10.277
A LITTLE MORE...

40:15.064 --> 40:16.762
EXCUSE ME,
UM, MISS, UM...

40:16.762 --> 40:18.154
COULD I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

40:18.154 --> 40:20.200
SURE.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.071
UM...IF SOMEBODY
GIVES YOU SOMETHING
THAT YOU DON'T WANT,

40:22.071 --> 40:24.944
LIKE WEDDING STUFF,
UH...

40:24.944 --> 40:26.424
CAN YOU EXCHANGE IT
FOR CASH?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.165
WELL, IT DEPENDS
ON HOW IT'S PAID FOR, SIR,

40:29.165 --> 40:30.253
BUT SOMETIMES, YES.

40:32.168 --> 40:34.040
THANKS.YOU'RE WELCOME.

40:45.704 --> 40:46.922
HI.

40:46.922 --> 40:47.836
HI.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.233
UH, SO, BAILEY,

40:53.233 --> 40:55.278
THANKS
FOR LAST NIGHT.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.019
YOU KNOW, FOR GIVING
ME THE PLACE.

40:57.019 --> 40:58.020
OH, HEY...

40:58.020 --> 40:58.934
NO SWEAT.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.242
SO, UM...

41:02.242 --> 41:03.765
WHERE'D YOU END UP
SPENDING THE NIGHT?

41:05.071 --> 41:06.072
OH. UM...

41:08.030 --> 41:10.772
I JUST...CRASHED
ON A BUDDY'S FLOOR.

41:10.772 --> 41:11.773
REALLY?

41:11.773 --> 41:12.774
YEAH.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.602
OH. WELL, THANKS.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.388
SO...

41:20.434 --> 41:21.783
HOW ARE YOU?

41:21.783 --> 41:23.002
YOU ALL RIGHT?

41:23.002 --> 41:24.046
YEAH.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.787
YEAH, I'M FINE.

41:25.787 --> 41:26.962
I'M JUST...

41:26.962 --> 41:28.007
FINE.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.922
OK, GOOD.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.402
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST...

41:32.402 --> 41:34.187
WELL, I'M JUST...

41:36.406 --> 41:37.320
WHAT?

41:39.192 --> 41:42.456
I'M JUST STILL
COMPLETELY A VIRGIN.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.023
YOU'RE...

41:45.981 --> 41:47.592
YOU DIDN'T...

41:50.333 --> 41:52.118
AFTER ALL THAT...

41:52.118 --> 41:53.641
ALL THOSE...

41:53.641 --> 41:54.860
CANDLES?

41:54.860 --> 41:57.166
YEAH, YEAH.
WE DIDN'T DO IT.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.559
DON'T TELL ME
HE MISSED THE SIGNS.

41:58.559 --> 42:00.692
NO, NO.
HE SAW THE SIGNS.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.171
IT ALMOST HAPPENED.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.346
IT'S JUST
AT THE VERY LAST SECOND,

42:03.346 --> 42:05.218
I JUST...

42:05.218 --> 42:07.394
CHANGED MY MIND.

42:10.310 --> 42:11.746
REALLY?

42:11.746 --> 42:14.270
WHY?

42:14.270 --> 42:17.665
I JUST, YOU KNOW, I WAS
LOOKING AROUND MY ROOM,

42:17.665 --> 42:21.190
AND IT WAS LIKE I SAW
MY WHOLE EXISTENCE,

42:21.190 --> 42:23.715
BUT EVERYTHING
THAT I SAW WAS NEW.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.718
YOU KNOW? NEW PLACE,

42:26.718 --> 42:29.155
NEW SCHOOL,
NEW BOYFRIEND, NEW LIFE.

42:31.723 --> 42:33.638
ALL THESE CHANGES
IN, LIKE, THE LAST
5 MINUTES,

42:33.638 --> 42:35.553
AND--I DON'T KNOW--

42:35.553 --> 42:38.077
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE
ADDING ANOTHER CHANGE
TO THE MIX

42:38.077 --> 42:39.426
SEEMED LIKE A BAD IDEA.

42:41.689 --> 42:43.082
YOU KNOW? LIKE TOO MUCH.

42:44.692 --> 42:47.216
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S REALLY LAME?

42:50.524 --> 42:51.438
NO.

42:52.657 --> 42:53.571
I DON'T.

42:55.790 --> 42:57.444
I DON'T.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.315
'CAUSE I WAS SAYING

42:59.315 --> 43:01.274
THAT EL NINO
WOULDN'T SHIFT
MIGRATION PATTERNS.

43:01.274 --> 43:03.058
BUT, REALLY,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

43:03.058 --> 43:04.277
HA HA.
IT WAS A GUESS.

43:04.277 --> 43:05.408
I MEAN,
AN EDUCATED GUESS,

43:05.408 --> 43:07.236
BUT, STILL,
IT WAS A GUESS.

43:07.236 --> 43:09.108
AND I WAS SO AFRAID
THAT WE'D GET
DOWN THERE,

43:09.108 --> 43:11.414
AND I, YOU KNOW,
WOULDN'T SEE, LIKE,
A SINGLE WREN.

43:11.414 --> 43:12.894
GUESS WHAT.

43:12.894 --> 43:14.287
HA. WE SAW WRENS.

43:14.287 --> 43:17.595
AND WRENS AND WRENS.
IT WAS AMAZING.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.509
OF COURSE, WE STILL KNOW
NOTHING ABOUT EL NINO,

43:19.509 --> 43:21.337
BUT EVERYONE THINKS
I'M A GENIUS.

43:24.645 --> 43:25.690
OHH.

43:25.690 --> 43:28.562
SWEETIE, I MISSED YOU, TOO.

43:30.825 --> 43:33.132
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

43:33.132 --> 43:34.002
ANY NEWS?

43:37.353 --> 43:39.791
OK, I HAVE TO GUESS.
UM...

43:39.791 --> 43:42.794
ANY COLORFUL
RESTAURANT SNAFUS?

43:42.794 --> 43:44.143
UH...

43:44.143 --> 43:46.580
ANY WRINKLES
IN THE WEDDING PLANS?

43:46.580 --> 43:48.756
WHAT, CLAUDIA AND OWEN
WERE PERFECT KIDS?

43:48.756 --> 43:50.105
SHH.
