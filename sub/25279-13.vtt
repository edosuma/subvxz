00:15.515 --> 00:16.391
Dad?

00:17.642 --> 00:18.852
Nick's gone.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.062
What happened?

00:21.146 --> 00:25.150
I told him I thought it'd be best
if he moved on. He's not coming back.

00:26.609 --> 00:27.694
You told him to leave?

00:30.613 --> 00:31.990
Why would you do that?

00:32.073 --> 00:33.158
Look at you.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.411
Walking up to an ex-con's house, angry,

00:36.953 --> 00:38.371
with a rifle in your hand.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.290
I had one way

00:40.915 --> 00:43.793
to find Rooster and you just fucked it up.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.129
I know this is hard, Colt.

00:46.212 --> 00:47.297
Because of you.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.467
If Nick was here, I'd have some answers.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.098
Come on, Colt, stop.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.185
Christ. There's nothin' in there.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.150
[quietly] How do you know?

01:08.276 --> 01:09.694
You don't know anything.

01:10.487 --> 01:13.323
You just made up your mind
as to what's gonna happen.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.784
I'm trying to protect you.

01:15.867 --> 01:16.868
Bullshit.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.246
You always talk about being there
for the family.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.582
But when the shit hits the fan...

01:23.792 --> 01:24.876

02:42.704 --> 02:44.664
Oh, I wanted to be with you.

02:45.456 --> 02:46.332
[Abby] Gosh.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.877
Thank you,
but I told you I'm doin' all right.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.005
-I talked to your dad and he's worried.
-Oh!

02:52.088 --> 02:54.507
-He's full of shit.
-You got a black eye.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.758
Babe, I'm fine.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.052
And Rooster is fine.

02:58.636 --> 02:59.721
I'm close to finding him.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.307
That Nick ran him out of town.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.267
So if I can get
into Rooster's bank account

03:04.350 --> 03:06.436
I can use his credit-card charges
to track him.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.146
[Abby clears throat]

03:12.442 --> 03:13.902
When's the last time you slept?

03:14.611 --> 03:17.197
Oh, I slept a little bit
in the back of the police car.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.240
Back of the police car?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.117
-What the fuck happened?
-Don't worry.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.953
I... Help me figure out his password.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.664
I already tried "Redneck Rambo,"

03:26.748 --> 03:28.416
"Fuck Tom Brady,"

03:28.499 --> 03:30.126
"Mr. Carrie Underwood."

03:30.793 --> 03:32.921
I can't imagine
what you're going through right now,

03:33.004 --> 03:35.423
but maybe you should put
the computer down and talk to me.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.717
I'm in.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.510
[chuckles]

03:39.677 --> 03:41.346
His password's "Colt sucks."

03:41.888 --> 03:44.682
I shoulda known that.
Mine's "Colt rules," but with a "Z."

03:45.475 --> 03:46.809
Let's see what you can find.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.019
All right, here we go.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.856

03:52.440 --> 03:53.942

-[Abby chuckles]

03:55.860 --> 03:57.237
Okay, recent charges.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.448
Holy shit.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.327
It's the Backcountry Lodge, Norwood.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.662
-That's from today.
-Yep.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.789
I found him.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.832
I fuckin' found him.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.834
I can't believe this.
We gotta tell your dad.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.920
No, he'll find out
when Rooster comes home.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.298
Oh, and remind me
to change his password to "Colt Rulez."

04:17.382 --> 04:18.383
[chuckles]

04:22.011 --> 04:23.596
[Dale] How's Colt, er...

04:23.680 --> 04:25.348
doing with all this?

04:25.431 --> 04:26.641
Not good.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.895
He's mad at everything and everybody.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.772
I think Abby being here's
gonna help a lot.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.276
Thing is, I can understand
why Colt's so angry.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.280
He knew right away
that something was wrong.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.407
And I brushed him off.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.287
What kind of a father ignores his son?

04:48.538 --> 04:51.457
There's not a damn thing
you coulda done different.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.876
There's a lot of things
I coulda done different.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.503
Don't beat yourself up, Beau.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.755
You raised good men with good hearts.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.467
When my house burned down
Colt went over there to salvage stuff.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.845
And he was so excited
when he came back with that jewelry

05:03.928 --> 05:06.931
that I didn't have the heart to tell him
he stole it from my neighbor's house.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.268
And then Rooster left me
a bottle of whiskey,

05:10.351 --> 05:13.271
with a note on it that said,
"Fight fire with Fireball."

05:14.147 --> 05:16.482
Well, it was half a bottle.
[chuckles]

05:17.442 --> 05:18.776
Go ahead.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.446
You always say the right thing.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.283
And thank you, pard.

05:26.117 --> 05:29.704
Just lookin' at you reminds me
that things could always be worse.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.147
We got a new puppy.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.732
Labradoodle.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.693
We named him Matlock.

Hell of a way to spend your birthday.

Is Colt any better?

06:21.047 --> 06:22.131
No.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.591
But Abby's with him.

06:25.134 --> 06:27.053
This whole thing's just unbelievable.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.764
[whispering] It is.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.267
I wanna see where... it happened.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.661
it's not your fault.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.873
It was an accident.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.208

12:32.126 --> 12:34.170

that taught Rooster how to ride.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.548

who loaned him the money for the bike.

[voice wavering] I'm just so
upside down, y'know?

12:46.015 --> 12:49.477
I just keep expecting him to walk
through that door with a six-pack

12:49.560 --> 12:52.188
and that fake country music award
he used to...

12:52.980 --> 12:54.899

12:55.483 --> 12:56.358

12:56.901 --> 12:59.612
Hey, I keep listening
to his last voicemail.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.907
It's kinda comforting to hear his voice.

13:03.991 --> 13:08.454
Even if he is asking how far after the
expiration date you can still drink milk.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.123
Fuckin' knucklehead.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.795

13:17.505 --> 13:18.672
Me, too.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.259
Yeah, we all do.

13:29.183 --> 13:31.185
[tires on gravel]

13:41.487 --> 13:43.155
Something I can do for you, son?

13:43.948 --> 13:46.784
Mornin'. I have news about Rooster.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.544
Oh, hey, you're up.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.003
Good.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.422
Got you a decaf...

14:02.383 --> 14:03.342
from the lobby.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.594
There was also some donuts there,

14:05.678 --> 14:08.973
but there was a big can
of OFF! right next to 'em, so...

14:09.390 --> 14:11.016
I just spoke to your dad.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.269

14:27.700 --> 14:29.827
The police came by.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.957
And they're calling off
the search for Rooster.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.003
Why?

14:40.588 --> 14:41.672
Apparently...

14:43.382 --> 14:44.884
they found his wallet...

14:46.302 --> 14:49.346
and some clothing
and there was blood on it...

14:50.514 --> 14:52.850

down the river.

14:54.101 --> 14:54.977

14:56.729 --> 14:57.605

14:59.189 --> 15:00.024
So?

15:00.649 --> 15:01.525
So?

and rescue to search and recovery.

-[Abby sighs]
-Who cares?

15:09.533 --> 15:11.327
They weren't gonna find him, anyway.

make this whole disappearance look real.

-[sighing] Colt, come on.
-[Colt] I'm serious.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.293
Okay.

You know this room is a part of it.

15:22.671 --> 15:23.589
Right?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.176
I figured it out last night. I was...

15:27.259 --> 15:28.969
If Rooster's in hiding, right,

15:29.053 --> 15:30.971
why would he use his credit card
to stay here?

15:32.306 --> 15:33.223
It's too easy to track.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.142
I figured it out and I'm a fuckin' idiot.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.353
Then why is all his stuff here?

15:37.436 --> 15:39.021
It's a decoy room.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.399
Babe, all this stuff, this is decoy stuff.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.235

Look at this stuff.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.488
He wouldn't pack any of this...
Fuckin' jean shorts?

15:47.571 --> 15:48.530
A collared shirt?

15:48.614 --> 15:49.698
A book?!

15:50.282 --> 15:51.158
Colt.

15:51.659 --> 15:55.537
No one wants to see Rooster again
more than I do, okay?

15:55.621 --> 15:58.666
I wanna see him walk through that door
and say, "Badass,"

15:58.749 --> 16:02.628
and pretend that this is his baby and do
all the other stupid shit that he does,

16:03.045 --> 16:04.129
but at some point

16:04.213 --> 16:06.548
we are going to have to face reality.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.841
What reality?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.885
The fact that he might
not be coming back at all!

16:09.969 --> 16:11.261
He's out there.

16:11.345 --> 16:12.763
I want to believe that, too.

16:12.846 --> 16:13.806
Then believe it!

16:14.390 --> 16:16.266

16:16.350 --> 16:19.436

to go look for you, that didn't stop me.

-This is different.
-No!

and I did.

16:47.923 --> 16:48.799
Hi.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.342
Hey.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.637
I thought you were gonna come in the house
when you dropped Abby off.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.848
I didn't wanna get into it with Dad again.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.725
You change your hair?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.103
No, just Aunt Karen started chemo,

17:01.186 --> 17:03.647
and you know that whole
"shave your head for solidarity."

17:03.731 --> 17:06.942
Well, she wasn't a very good sister,
so I got highlights.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.652
Looks great.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.113
Hey, erm...

17:11.739 --> 17:14.825
I just... Sorry you had to come
all the way back for no reason.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.827
You're sorry?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.456
Of course, when I heard, I'd be here.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.083
Well, maybe now you can
help me find him, huh?

have put together a little something

17:34.011 --> 17:35.512
this Saturday for Rooster.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.520
No, no.

We're gonna have a celebration
of his life.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.863

18:04.666 --> 18:05.542
he's gone.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.544
Jesus Christ.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.297
Is that what you came here to say?

18:11.840 --> 18:15.010
I mean, everyone in this family just
can't wait to fuckin' forget about him.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.805
You think I don't want him alive
as much as you do?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.432
You don't think I wouldn't give
the world to have him back?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.184
But it's not going to happen.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.435
How do you say that?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.271
Because...

18:26.355 --> 18:28.232
yesterday was my birthday.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.818
And every year, without fail,

18:30.901 --> 18:33.153
Rooster calls to sing
"Happy Birthday" to me.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.030
I mean, usually drunk,

18:35.114 --> 18:36.490

18:36.573 --> 18:38.575
once with Chumlee from <i>Pawn Stars,</i>

18:38.659 --> 18:40.494

18:41.161 --> 18:42.412
until yesterday.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.165
Mom... Mom.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.459
Mom...

18:47.543 --> 18:48.836
he couldn't call you...

18:49.419 --> 18:50.504
because he's hiding.

18:52.214 --> 18:53.966
He doesn't want anyone
to know where he is.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.468
Okay, that is not what's happening here.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.428

18:58.804 --> 19:00.389
I promise you...

19:01.265 --> 19:02.891
you are going to see Rooster--

19:02.975 --> 19:05.644
Okay, stop it. Just stop it, Colt!

19:12.442 --> 19:14.528

19:14.611 --> 19:17.823
that he's gonna come
walking through the door, and he's not.
