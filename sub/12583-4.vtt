WEBVTT

00:37.662 --> 00:39.414


00:39.497 --> 00:43.084
Why would anyone do drugs
when they could just mow a lawn?

00:43.251 --> 00:45.003
Hank, we were all out
of your sports drink,

00:45.086 --> 00:46.546
so I blended some lemonade

00:46.629 --> 00:48.548
with a few of Bobby's chewable vitamins.

00:48.673 --> 00:51.384
If you want,
we can call it "Lemon-ator-ade."

00:53.762 --> 00:54.763
I gotta say,

00:54.846 --> 00:56.681
we walk through this neighborhood
all the time,

00:56.765 --> 00:59.100
and you have the most
beautifully maintained house.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.478
What's your secret
to keeping the grass so green?

01:01.561 --> 01:03.188
-Uh...
Oh, it's simple, really.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.441
We water it.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.444
Uh, actually, it's not that simple.

01:09.527 --> 01:14.616
Every three weeks, I put down a 28-3-3
mix of fertilizer and weed control.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.533
Oh.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.578
Well, it's not just the lawn.
It's all the attention to detail.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.456
Like the way the brass door knocker
sets off the color of the trim.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.457
Oh, right.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.668
And it matches the hinges perfectly.
Did it come as a set?

01:25.752 --> 01:27.128
Well, uh...

01:27.754 --> 01:28.838
I'm not sure.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.175
Interesting story about the screws
in those hinges...

01:32.258 --> 01:34.844
Hey, you want to see
something really great?

01:35.386 --> 01:39.182
Just look at these drapes
and tell me they're not real velvet, huh?

01:41.476 --> 01:43.353
I-Interesting story, uh...

01:44.020 --> 01:46.272
I bought these the day
John Lennon was shot.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.028
What was I thinking?

01:52.112 --> 01:55.824
Dragging those people off the street.
They probably thought I was nuts.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.743
Yeah, I was a little confused myself.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.453
I guess it just hit me.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.331
I have nothing to do
with our house's curb appeal.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.500
Hank, from now on

02:05.583 --> 02:08.294
I am becoming more involved
in the front yard.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.672
Maybe plant some exotic flowers.

02:10.755 --> 02:13.508
Something that says,
"Peggy Hill lives here."

02:13.591 --> 02:15.260
The front yard, huh?

02:15.343 --> 02:18.054
I tell you what.
How about we repaint the kitchen?

02:18.304 --> 02:20.598
You can pick out any shade of white
you want.

02:20.682 --> 02:23.476
Eggshell, ivory, Swiss coffee.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.727
Sky's the limit.

02:24.811 --> 02:29.065
The front yard is the statement
a home makes to the rest of the world.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.650
Right now, it's your statement.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.986
It should be our statement.

02:33.611 --> 02:37.157
Well, I guess we could try
a few flowers under the windows.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.992
But nothing that climbs.

02:40.952 --> 02:41.995
Yep.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.413
Mm, yep.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.998
What the...

02:45.081 --> 02:47.125
How do you like Joseph's new minibike?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.085
He won it off me in a poker game.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.171
You know, that bike's not street legal.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.382
All right. Joseph, get off the street!

02:54.465 --> 02:56.759
No, not on the lawns!

02:56.843 --> 03:00.013
Boy, Hank, you sure got
a lot of arbitrary rules.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.684
Got a lotta dang ol' flowers, man.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.394
Talkin' 'bout an ol' Algernon man.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.605
Talkin' 'bout ol' Cliff Robertson,
I tell you what, man.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.815
Got-dang ol' five cents a minute, man.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.442
Yeah, Peggy's fixing up

03:12.525 --> 03:13.693
the front yard a bit.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.654
Gee, Hank, if your wife
wants to screw something up,

03:16.738 --> 03:18.489
why can't she just stick to Bobby?

03:18.573 --> 03:19.449
It'll be fine.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.660
The plants have little tags
with instructions on 'em.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.538
Please don't ruin my yard.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.545
Congratulations, Bill.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.173
You no longer have the worst yard
in Arlen.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.635
Peggy's traveling circus of death
has seen to that.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.471
Yeah, man, she just like
the dang ol' grim reaper, man.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.389
Talkin' 'bout them ol' sunflowers.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.099
And then them petunias.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.684
And the ol' daisies, too, man.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.019
"Help me!"

03:49.312 --> 03:52.023
She's trying so hard.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.485
Joseph, that is not a toy!

03:57.403 --> 03:59.364
Hey, you put a dent in it.

03:59.447 --> 04:00.573
Sorry, Dad.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.076
I sorta crashed into a telephone pole.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.285
I don't care what you...

04:05.078 --> 04:06.246
Oh...

04:06.329 --> 04:07.830
I can't stay mad at you.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.958
Bet you can't steer that thing
with your feet.

04:11.292 --> 04:16.297
So, uh, Peggy, maybe it's time
to pull up some of those dead plants.

04:16.381 --> 04:17.507
They're not dead.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.217
They just need some more sunlight.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.843
There's no damn sun!

04:22.804 --> 04:25.682
-Well, maybe if you...
-No one asked for your opinion, okay?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.350
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.812
I just really want to do this on my own.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.022
Listen to your husband, Peggy Hill.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.068
If there's one thing that brillo-haired
hillbilly can do, it's farm.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.906
Angel of Death meet Old MacDonald!

04:41.990 --> 04:44.993
<i>♪ E-I-E-I-Ow! ♪</i>

04:46.077 --> 04:48.788
I tried perennials, I tried annuals,

04:48.871 --> 04:50.248
I tried succulents...

04:50.331 --> 04:53.584
Well, you just got to keep trying
until you find the right thing,

04:53.668 --> 04:55.837
and when you finally do, you'll know it.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.963
Thank you, Hank.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.548
She just touched your arm.

04:58.631 --> 04:59.924
Quick, amputate!

05:08.266 --> 05:10.435
Excuse me, do you know of a plant

05:10.518 --> 05:14.314
that can withstand over-watering,
inadequate fertilization,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.858
and perhaps some over-zealous pruning?

05:16.941 --> 05:18.651
Yeah, they're called weeds.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.445
Great, give me a tray of...

05:21.863 --> 05:22.947
You know, hotshot,

05:23.197 --> 05:25.575
you may think you have the world
by the tail right now,

05:25.658 --> 05:29.454
making five dollars an hour,
with that ridiculous red vest and...

05:29.537 --> 05:31.748
Just give us a flat of impatiens.

05:32.248 --> 05:34.208
I'm not done with you, Pimples.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.087
Impatiens.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.006
Everyone has impatiens.

05:40.089 --> 05:42.633
How is that gonna wow the pants off
anyone?

05:42.967 --> 05:45.553
Ooh! An estate sale. Pull over.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.473
Dead people have tons of clothes
that they don't want anymore.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.974
Fine, but make it fast.

05:50.058 --> 05:53.144
If these turds die in the car,
I'll set a new record.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.403
Oh, what beautiful morning glories.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.613
Thank you.

06:03.696 --> 06:04.989
So, you're a gardener?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
I'm beginning to think no.

06:08.785 --> 06:12.080
My God, I love that. What's that called?

06:12.163 --> 06:13.748
Oh, that's Winklebottom.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.750
Kind of a rarity in these parts.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.377
Came all the way from Germany.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.130
Mm, boy, that's exactly
what I need in my front yard.

06:21.422 --> 06:22.965
Would you consider selling?

06:27.845 --> 06:30.807
Come on, let's get this in the ground
before Hank gets home.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.309
Peggy Hill has found her calling card.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.147
Idiot.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.416
So, what do you think?

06:56.499 --> 07:00.294
I, I think... uh, I think it's an elf.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.672
Actually, the term is "garden gnome."

07:02.755 --> 07:04.841
His name is Winklebottom.

07:04.924 --> 07:07.468
Don't you just love
how your eye goes right to him?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.804
Yeah, I didn't even notice the house.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.098
I cannot tell you what a relief this is.

07:12.181 --> 07:15.268
I was getting so frustrated
with everything dying on me.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.270
Uh, I don't know, Peggy.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.480
Do you really think this is, uh...

07:19.564 --> 07:21.399
this, this thing is for us?

07:21.482 --> 07:22.817
It was just like you said.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.446
I saw it, and I immediately knew.
Just like you said.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.656
Uh... yeah.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.742
Oh, we have a garden gnome.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.952
Oh, boy.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.788
I shall call him Vandor.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.833
You will call him Winklebottom,
like everyone else.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.460
Now let's go get an old toothbrush.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.587
I want to clean the spider eggs
from his ears.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.635
So is that a ceramic gnome,

07:49.719 --> 07:53.347
or did Peggy kill a real gnome
and take it to a taxidermist?

07:53.431 --> 07:57.101
Gosh, Hank, what will people think
when they see that thing out here?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.352
God willing,

07:58.436 --> 08:00.146
they'll think Peggy's a widow.

08:00.229 --> 08:03.816
Hey, how do we know
you didn't buy the gnome yourself

08:03.900 --> 08:06.068
and are just pretending
not to like the gnome

08:06.152 --> 08:08.446
so that your friends
don't make fun of you?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.740
<i>♪ Hank likes the gnome ♪</i>

08:10.823 --> 08:12.408
<i>♪ Hank likes the gnome ♪</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.744
I do not like the gnome, Bill.

08:14.827 --> 08:18.122
<i>♪ Hank-y and Gnome-y sittin' in a tree ♪</i>

08:18.206 --> 08:19.832
That's it. I'm kicking your ass.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.084
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

08:31.219 --> 08:32.553
Good morning, Hank.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.889
Ah. Good morning, Mailman Thompson.

08:39.936 --> 08:43.648
Hank, were you trying to keep
that mailman from seeing our gnome?

08:43.731 --> 08:45.733
No, no. Of course not.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.362
Oh. You just did it again.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.239
Well, it's just that

08:51.322 --> 08:52.865
people are starting to,

08:52.949 --> 08:56.285
you know, say nasty things
about our house.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.120
Like what? What are they saying?

08:58.204 --> 09:00.581
Well, like yesterday,
I heard the FedEx guy

09:00.665 --> 09:04.085
call our house "the one
with the gnome out front."

09:04.168 --> 09:07.296
Oh, I see what this is all about.

09:07.380 --> 09:12.009
For years, everyone has always raved
about your grass and your hinges,

09:12.093 --> 09:15.304
and now you're afraid
you're being displaced.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.848
My God. What a beautiful Winklebottom.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.267
Yes, very good.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.686
That is Winklebottom. How did you know?

09:21.769 --> 09:24.397
Are you kidding?
I'd recognize one anywhere.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.276
That darling bulbous nose.
Those adorable hairy knuckles...

09:28.359 --> 09:33.072
This is a 1932 original,
handmade by Klaus Zeigenlef, himself.

09:33.155 --> 09:34.323
Really?

09:34.407 --> 09:35.616
You hear that, Hank?

09:35.700 --> 09:36.867
I heard it.

09:36.951 --> 09:41.414
I am just so envious, but do you mind
if I offer up a little tip?

09:41.497 --> 09:44.333
Your Winklebottom is facing southeast.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.168
Technically, he should face north.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.087
Wonderful. Why?

09:48.170 --> 09:51.090
Well, that's where they're more apt
to find tree moss,

09:51.173 --> 09:53.342
which is how they make
their delicious gnome tea.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.553
That is so charming.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.679
No, it's not.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.848
Oh, there's so much lore
for you to discover.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.850
You're gonna lose yourself for hours

10:00.933 --> 10:02.768
in all the chat rooms and message boards.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.479
Hey, are you into <i>Babylon 5?</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:07.023
No. Should I be?

10:11.694 --> 10:14.572
Oh. "Garden Gnome Fact Number 28.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.700
At night, garden gnomes are quite lively,

10:17.783 --> 10:20.953
but they turn to stone
the second daylight hits them."

10:21.037 --> 10:22.496
I love it.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.081
Hey, maybe tonight

10:24.165 --> 10:26.792
we should leave out a snack plate
for old Winklebottom.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.336
Perhaps a fruit pie?

10:28.419 --> 10:29.670
No, Bobby.

10:29.754 --> 10:32.673
Winklebottom would like
mushrooms and dandelions

10:32.757 --> 10:35.468
and a thimbleful of peppermint schnapps.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.637
Look, Mom, they have a whole section

10:37.720 --> 10:39.805
called "gnomenclature."

10:41.265 --> 10:43.392
Thank you, President Winklebottom.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.936
I would love to join you for tea
in the Rose Gar...

10:46.020 --> 10:48.314
We got a shooter! I'll take the bullet!

10:51.984 --> 10:54.487
Oh...

10:54.570 --> 10:56.697
Dad, I need your help!

10:56.781 --> 10:58.699
I broke Winklebottom.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.285
-Oh, boy.
-It was an accident, I swear.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.496
Please, tell me you can fix it.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.081
All right, let's take a look.

11:23.057 --> 11:26.811
Uh... I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.187
Sorry, Bobby.

11:28.270 --> 11:30.398
But, but Mom loved that gnome.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.899
She's gonna kill me.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.401
Bobby, calm down.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.779
How do you expect me to calm down?
You can't fix it!

11:36.862 --> 11:38.698
Yeah, but maybe it's for the best.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.909
Your mother had grown
way too attached to that gnome.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.994
Better that something happened to it now,

11:44.078 --> 11:46.247
before she got even more attached to it.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.874
Don't worry, Bobby,
I'll take care of everything.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.460
Oh, thanks, Dad.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.087
Uh, don't sweat it.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.172
That's what being a father is all about.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.511
Okay, we're gonna dump him
in one of these cans,

12:00.594 --> 12:01.804
and if he doesn't fit,

12:01.887 --> 12:04.682
just whack him a few times
with this fire extinguisher.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.643
So, Mom's really gonna think
someone stole it?

12:07.727 --> 12:09.729
Uh-huh. There. That one.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.189
Uh, I don't know about this house.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.899
There's a lot of lights on.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.317
All right.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.362
That driveway's empty.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.531
Someone could pull in at any moment.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.116
Fine, I'll do it myself.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.080
Is that you, Janet?

12:49.268 --> 12:51.771
We did it, Dad. We really did it.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.980
Not yet, we didn't.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.242
Bobby, we are never
to speak of this again.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.922
Good morning.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.717
-So how was miniature golf last night?
-Um, okay.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.844
We were there for 90 minutes.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.305
Dad shot a three under par,
and I shot four over.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.140
Later, we stopped for ice cream.

13:30.434 --> 13:31.936
Oh, there's my paper.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.734
Remember, son, everything's gonna be okay.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.069
Winklebottom!

13:40.152 --> 13:41.612
My Winklebottom!

13:41.862 --> 13:43.614
This is just awful.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.658
Who would do such a thing?

13:45.741 --> 13:46.617
Hooligans.

13:46.700 --> 13:49.286
Oh, it's just so senseless!

13:49.370 --> 13:50.496
Oh, my God.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.082
Peggy, Hank, what happened
to our Winklebottom?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.334
Oh, I don't know, Sally.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.086
I don't know!

13:57.169 --> 13:58.462
I'm calling the police.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.256
The cops? Dad.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.592
Now, hold on, there. The police
have more important things to do than...

14:03.676 --> 14:05.928
Hank, honey, you're too frazzled
to think straight.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.055
Aunt Sally's taking care of things now.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.559
So is Winklebottom his first name

14:11.642 --> 14:12.601
or his last name?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.646
I told you it's just Winklebottom,
damn it!

14:15.729 --> 14:16.981
We're wasting time here!

14:17.064 --> 14:19.024
I'm just trying to be thorough, ma'am.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.735
Now did any of you hear
any strange noises last night?

14:21.819 --> 14:23.904
No, sir. I was here all night.

14:23.988 --> 14:24.905
No, you weren't.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.074
You were out playing miniature golf
last night.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.577
He shot three under par. I shot four over.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.120
We stopped for ice cream!

14:31.203 --> 14:33.706
Oh, right. That course out there
on Lexington.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.499
That last hole's a doozy, ain't it?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.836
-Yes.
-Please, Officer,

14:38.919 --> 14:41.839
tell me you'll catch the bastards
who did this.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.799
Honestly, ma'am,
there's not much I can do.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.303
Teenagers are always stealing these things
and doing God knows what to them.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.722
If we ever do find your Winklebottom,

14:49.805 --> 14:52.057
there's a good chance
you're not gonna want him back.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.642
No.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.854
Hey!

14:58.147 --> 14:59.523
Fancy riding, Tex!

15:04.612 --> 15:07.865
<i>♪ Green Acres is the place to be ♪</i>

15:07.948 --> 15:11.076
<i>♪ Farm livin' is the life for me ♪</i>

15:11.160 --> 15:13.329
<i>♪ Land spreadin' ♪</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:16.081
Oh, heck.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.294
Come on, Peggy.
It was just a garden gnome.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.422
Yeah, and propane is just a stupid gas!

15:24.256 --> 15:25.591
Uh, I'm sorry.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.885
I have no reason to lash out at you.

15:27.968 --> 15:32.222
It's just that you get praised
all the time about the house, but I don't.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.975
That's why Winklebottom
was a big deal for me.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.520
Complete strangers would walk by our house
and say to themselves,

15:38.854 --> 15:41.482
"That's the lady with the cool gnome."

15:41.649 --> 15:43.233
Now I'm just the old hag

15:43.317 --> 15:45.611
who picks up dog poop with a hockey stick.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.992
Bobby, I'm telling your mother
what happened.

15:52.076 --> 15:53.035
You're what?

15:53.118 --> 15:54.954
I can't stand to see her like this.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.914
It's the only thing
that'll give her peace.

15:56.997 --> 15:57.998
No way!

15:58.082 --> 16:00.501
The whole time you've been giving me grief
about cracking,

16:00.584 --> 16:02.211
and now you're gonna crack?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.212
Uh-uh.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.838
We had a deal, old man.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.173
Hey, watch your mouth.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.091
Sorry.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.884
Look, I'll take all the heat.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.970
She won't know
you had anything to do with this.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.471
But she has to know.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.891
Uh, Peggy,

16:15.975 --> 16:18.018
I've got something difficult to tell you.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.646
Vandals didn't take your gnome.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.065
It was me.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.024
What?

16:24.108 --> 16:25.943
Well, his ear broke off,

16:26.026 --> 16:28.320
so I drove him
to the Heimlich County Forest

16:28.404 --> 16:30.948
and buried him in a shallow grave.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.075
No. No, you're lying.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.868
I'm not, Peggy. It's the truth.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.705
No. Even if you hated Winklebottom,

16:37.788 --> 16:41.667
there is no way
you would ever do such a hurtful thing.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.669
Oh, my God,

16:43.752 --> 16:45.379
you're covering for someone.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.007
-Peggy, I'm, I'm not...
-Bobby! It's Bobby!

16:48.090 --> 16:49.591
-Me?
-Of course.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.011
You were playing one
of your weird little games,

16:52.094 --> 16:53.971
and you broke it, didn't you?

16:54.054 --> 16:55.681
Uh... uh... Dad?

16:55.764 --> 16:57.599
No, no, really, it was me.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.602
I couldn't stand the little freak,
so I rolled him in a towel

17:00.686 --> 17:02.563
and smashed him to pieces
for good measure.

17:02.646 --> 17:05.357
You should've seen him, Mom.
He was nuts!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.777
How dare you try laying this
on your father.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.571
You're grounded for a week, mister.

17:10.654 --> 17:12.656
-Dad!
-Peggy, really, he didn't...

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
Don't make it any worse for him, Hank!

17:14.324 --> 17:15.909
Now you go to your room!

17:23.333 --> 17:24.293
Dinnertime.

17:24.376 --> 17:27.546
One peanut butter
and jelly sandwich, no dessert.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.631
There's pudding in my sock.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.633
Everything'll be fine.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.177
Your mother will get over this.

17:33.260 --> 17:34.303
No, she won't.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.597
Dad, you've got to get her a new one.

17:36.680 --> 17:37.514
But...

17:37.598 --> 17:38.974
...that thing was pretty rare.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.893
I wouldn't even know
where to get another one.

17:40.976 --> 17:44.730
I do. You know that German tourist town
on I-35?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.566
The one with the windmills
and the gingerbread houses?

17:48.776 --> 17:49.985
New Hoffenschime.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.781
If they don't have a replacement
for Winklebottom, then no one does.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.115
Lights out, Bobby.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.451
I said, lights out!

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
I'll bring you back a T-shirt.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.839
I need a gnome.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.466
And not just any gnome.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.426
I need a Winklebottom.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.470
A Winklebottom.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.347
Why don't you just ask me
to move a rainbow?

18:18.430 --> 18:22.601
Ugh. I can't tell
if you're being sarcastic or just weird.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.854
If you're lucky enough
to get a hold of a Winklebottom,

18:25.938 --> 18:27.773
you better hang on for dear life.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.692
Now, if you want something spectacular,
how about one of these?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.277
Just marked it down 80%.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.238
Hey, what's that over there?

18:34.696 --> 18:37.199
Oh, that's an antique Figgleforth.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.326
True, he looks very similar
to Winklebottom,

18:39.409 --> 18:40.786
but let me warn you,

18:41.286 --> 18:43.539
completely different personality.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.624
Wrap him up and get me out of here.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.209
Oh, a Figgleforth.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.711
Excuse me, I had him first.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.004
Actually, you didn't.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.591
Hey, hey, let's leave the fighting
to the trolls, okay?

18:54.675 --> 18:57.302
I really need this particular gnome.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.512
Who doesn't?

18:58.595 --> 19:01.390
I bet this joker doesn't even know
where gnomes come from.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.433
Or how they say good night to each other.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.435
Or what it means
when they shave their mustache

19:05.519 --> 19:06.520
and not their beard.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.856
All right, you got me.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.024
I'm not a dork, I sell propane.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.193
Truth is, I hate gnomes.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.362
I really, really hate them.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.864
But my wife loves 'em.

19:16.947 --> 19:21.743
And as beautiful as my lawn
and my galvanized steel rain gutters are,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.996
they're no match for my wife's happiness.

19:24.079 --> 19:26.707
I'd do anything to see her happy again.

19:26.915 --> 19:30.502
Even if it means putting this character
in my yard.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.380
Okay, Blanche, the gnome is yours.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.886
Huh. Declined. You're maxed out.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.345
Put it on layaway!

19:40.429 --> 19:41.513
I'll pay cash.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.516
Come back and see us again.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.810
Uh, yeah, I don't think so.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.687
I was talking to Figgleforth.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.317
Yup. That's true north.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.235
Here, you can give this to your mother.

19:55.319 --> 19:59.865
It's the fully executed copy
of the, uh, adoption papers.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.743
I know how hard
that must have been for you, Dad.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.411
You want to talk about it?

20:04.494 --> 20:05.787
Just get your mother.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.830
Mom!

20:06.914 --> 20:09.791
Bobby, you are supposed to be...

20:09.875 --> 20:12.502
Oh. It's beautiful.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.880
His name is Figgleforth.

20:14.963 --> 20:16.798
We found him in New Hoffenschime.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.467
It was Bobby's idea.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.886
Oh, Hank, I love it.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.931
And it is so sweet of you
to give Bobby credit for this,

20:24.014 --> 20:26.141
but I know it was all you.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.018
-What?
-No, Peggy, he really...

20:28.101 --> 20:29.186
Oh, don't worry, Hank.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.855
I'm not mad at him anymore.
Kids will be kids.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.190
Tell you what, Bobby.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.901
Since your Dad's
being so generous towards you,

20:35.984 --> 20:36.944
so can I.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.820
I am suspending your sentence.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.988
Thanks.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.325
Yup. Now he's out here
for the whole world to see.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.369
You know, now that I think about it,

20:45.452 --> 20:48.080
I'm not sure if I even want
to keep him on the lawn.

20:48.163 --> 20:50.207
-You don't?
-Well, you heard that policeman.

20:50.290 --> 20:52.918
People steal these things all the time.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.003
Maybe it's best if we keep it inside.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.171
Yes. Perfect.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.006
Oh, that makes so much sense!

20:58.090 --> 20:59.132
Inside.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.560
-<i>♪ Hank likes the gnome ♪</i>
