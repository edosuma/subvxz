WEBVTT

00:04.704 --> 00:05.871
Ugh.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.506
How is it possible

00:07.508 --> 00:10.509
That kids weigh twice as
much when they're asleep?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.677
I know.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.679
And he should weigh less
after his little mishap

00:13.681 --> 00:15.447
On the spinning teacups.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.449
Yeah.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.852
Felt bad for that girl
in the cinderella costume

00:19.854 --> 00:21.653
In the cup behind us.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.656
She was right in
the splash zone.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.658
(groans)
I'm exhausted.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.293
Me, too.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.296
I'm also sticky and dirty
and sweaty and slimy.

00:31.298 --> 00:34.700
I'm like the seven dwarfs
of disgusting.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.302
Ugh, I should not have eaten
that funnel cake.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.904
(groans)

00:38.906 --> 00:40.506
Well, I see
your funnel cake

00:40.508 --> 00:44.643
And raise you a deep-fried
snickers stuffed into a twinkie.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.513
I think I blacked out briefly.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.581
(both groaning)

00:51.317 --> 00:54.053
Is being a dad always
this tiring?

00:54.055 --> 00:57.890
These are the best
moments of your life.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.559
And they are over
so fast.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.561
Seems like only yesterday,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.731
Jake was holding my hand
in the haunted house.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.568
Now he's half a world away
in the army,

01:09.570 --> 01:12.571
Wondering if a "dishonorable
discharge" is something you get

01:12.573 --> 01:13.839
From a dirty geisha.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.908
So sweet.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.919
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

01:26.921 --> 01:29.521
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.595
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

01:36.597 --> 01:37.796
Walden?

01:37.798 --> 01:40.632
What?

01:41.901 --> 01:42.868
What do you want?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.369
Are you asleep?

01:44.371 --> 01:47.072
(whines): Yes.

01:47.074 --> 01:50.476
That's what people do at...

01:50.478 --> 01:53.946
5:30 in the morning.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.582
Is it okay
if I can make breakfast?

01:56.584 --> 01:57.883
Sure.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.184
Thanks.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.722
Walden?

02:03.724 --> 02:07.793
Walden's not here,
please leave a message.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.895
How do you like your pancakes?

02:09.897 --> 02:11.897
Quietly.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.300
In three hours.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.669
With blueberries.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.505
Okay, I'll go make them.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.676
Oh, god.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.279
Flames.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.281
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

02:29.283 --> 02:31.183
Walden?

02:31.185 --> 02:33.118
Ready or not, here I come.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.987
What?

02:34.989 --> 02:37.623
Louis and I,
we're playing hide and seek.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.424
He's under his bed, hiding

02:39.426 --> 02:42.361
And I'm in the kitchen,
seeking sleep.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.962
I hear ya.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.765
I barely got my eight hours.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.600
I don't know
if I can handle this.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.602
Little boys have
a lot of energy.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.104
They're like cute
little crackheads.

02:52.106 --> 02:55.107
Except crackheads have
better toilet aim.

02:55.109 --> 02:57.509
No, no, this isn't about
being tired.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.479
I just, I don't know
if I'm cut out to be a dad.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
Hey, I didn't think I could live

03:01.882 --> 03:03.048
In a malibu beach house
for free,

03:03.050 --> 03:05.517
But I figured it out.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.120
Well, I don't know
if I can figure this out.

03:08.122 --> 03:09.955
I mean, th-this kid
has bounced around

03:09.957 --> 03:12.024
The foster care system
his whole life.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.059
I mean, I-I don't know
what he needs.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.227
I mean, does he need structure?

03:15.229 --> 03:16.228
Does he need freedom?

03:16.230 --> 03:19.164
Does he need medication?

03:19.166 --> 03:22.968
I should have asked that
before they dropped him off.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.037
All he needs is
your love and support.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.672
(imitates alan mockingly)

03:26.674 --> 03:28.473
That's a bunch of crap.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.876
Walden, every parent goes
through this.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.878
B-but you're actually
doing a great job.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.881
You're just overwhelmed
because this is all so new,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.050
A-and you're trying to be
everything to him all the time.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.885
You know, full-time dad,
full-time playmate.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.353
You have to give
yourself a break.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.354
How?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.755
He's 24-7.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.358
He's like the energizer bunny.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.760
You know why you never met
the energizer bunny's dad?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.996
'cause one night,
he went out for cigarettes,

03:50.998 --> 03:54.333
And he just kept going
and going and going.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.903
One thing that'll help
is getting louis some friends.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.171
Playdates.

03:59.173 --> 04:00.739
They chase each other
around for hours,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.741
Eventually they pass out
like work dogs.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.910
Kid'll be in
bed by 8:00,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.745
Then it's you, me,
a bowl of popcorn

04:06.747 --> 04:08.780
And binge-watching
<i>the good wife.</i>

04:08.782 --> 04:10.382
Okay, so what?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.384
So, I just...
I'll just google a place

04:12.386 --> 04:14.586
To meet a fun
cute six-year-old.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.954
Oh, yeah. No.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.790
I heard it when I said it.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.360
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

04:21.362 --> 04:22.961
Uh, this place
is awesome.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.030
They have a rock wall.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.099
Will you climb it with me?

04:27.101 --> 04:30.469
Oh, buddy, you know, the whole
idea is for you to come here

04:30.471 --> 04:32.070
And meet all these
other kids.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.205
No, just you and me.

04:33.207 --> 04:34.439
Please?

04:34.441 --> 04:35.374
Oh.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.876
All right,
I mean, come on.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.144
How do you say no to those eyes?

04:39.146 --> 04:40.445
I hear ya.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.547
Oh, uh, hey, can I have
some money for the snack bar?

04:42.549 --> 04:44.049
Please?
No.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.652
It's not my fault you already
spent all your allowance.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.127
Room for one more?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.094
Absolutely.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.429
Care for a juice box?

04:57.431 --> 05:00.399
We have cherry, grape
and chardonnay.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.969
Well, what else can I say
except, "chardonn-yay."

05:03.971 --> 05:06.071
Uh, I am alan.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.106
Uh, that's louis over there,
he's mine.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.776
I'm danielle, and that's
my daughter in the water wings.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.944
Oh, is there a pool here?
No.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.180
At some point,
you just pick your battles.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.150
I'm laurel, this is julie.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.187
Oh, hot dad on the rock wall.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.157
I claim this
as mount louis!

05:26.492 --> 05:28.026
Wow, he's really cute.

05:28.028 --> 05:28.994
Big time.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.295
Sorry, ladies.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.530
He's taken.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.597
No kidding?

05:32.599 --> 05:33.632
Good for you.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.100
How'd you snag him?

05:35.102 --> 05:38.270
I met him at a low point in his
life, and I took care of him.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.205
And he's been taking care
of me every day since.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.774
(oohing, giggling)

05:42.776 --> 05:44.509
That's the kind of man I need.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.511
No, that's the kind
of man I need.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.713
You're married.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.314
Yeah, to roger.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.316
He hasn't screwed me
since the prenup.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.185
Both:
Classic julie.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.855
Oh, this is so <i>sex and the city</i>
<i>right now.</i>

05:56.857 --> 05:59.057
Alan, do we
have any wipes?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.226
The kid above me dripped
something on my face.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.528
The best-case scenario is snot.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.896
Here, I've got some.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.865
Oh, thank you.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.034
Walden, this is, uh,
laurel, danielle and julie.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.736
The ladies, the gals.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.404
The juice box heroes.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.338
Hi.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.306
Hello.

06:14.308 --> 06:15.874
Hi, nice to meet you all.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.042
Your son is adorable.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.145
I'm his husband, silly.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.546
So, uh, which one's yours?

06:21.548 --> 06:22.647
My daughter, lily,

06:22.649 --> 06:24.416
Is the one licking
that little boy.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.085
Sweetie, we don't
lick strangers!

06:27.087 --> 06:29.321
Oh, and I thought
we were gonna be friends.

06:29.323 --> 06:30.856
All right.

06:30.858 --> 06:33.225
I'm headed to the ball pit.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.228
Same thing he said as he dove
under the covers last night.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.562
Boing.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.267
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:42.269 --> 06:43.702
Thanks for having us.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.905
I got to say, this is a
great spot for a playdate.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.507
This view is amazing.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.710
Yes. Yes, it is.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.712
You know, I used to walk
by houses like this

06:53.714 --> 06:55.080
And think the people
on the decks were just looking

06:55.082 --> 06:58.083
Down their noses at everyone,
feeling all superior.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.918
Now I know it's true.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.387
Roger sold our beach house

07:02.389 --> 07:04.189
'cause he said we never used it.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.625
Using that logic,
we should sell his penis.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.627
(laughs)

07:08.629 --> 07:10.629
Classic julie.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.898
Hey, w-we should make
this a regular thing.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.466
(thudding, shattering)

07:14.468 --> 07:17.135
Oh. Yeah, next time we'll
do it at one of your houses.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.272
Hey, uh, louis, is
everything okay?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.907
Over.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.910
Louis:
Lego tower fell over.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.478
Uh, you didn't
say "over."

07:26.480 --> 07:28.313
Over.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.315
I said the lego tower fell over.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.149
Over.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.985
You're so good
with him. Over.

07:33.987 --> 07:37.622
Actually, I-I feel like I
have no idea what I'm doing.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.057
Join the club.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.826
Parenting's
like a yoga class.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.427
You just do what
everybody else is doing

07:42.429 --> 07:44.329
And try not to laugh
when someone farts.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.068
Okay, so all the kids are
playing in louis' room.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.070
Well, technically, three
of them are playing together,

07:52.072 --> 07:54.239
And louis is in the corner,
coloring by himself.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.440
That's perfectly normal.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.809
The parenting books call it
"parallel play."

07:57.811 --> 07:59.811
Oh, that's good
to know.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.646
So, in high school,
I wasn't such a weirdo.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.649
I was just a parallel player.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.385
My sex life with my first wife
was a lot of parallel play.

08:08.588 --> 08:09.788
Just give louis time.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.323
Remember, this is
all new for him.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.858
Kind of like
learning on my honeymoon

08:12.860 --> 08:15.193
That I wasn't going to have sex
was all new for me.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.195
You know, I just want him
to have friends.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.798
You know, like a couple girls,
and a couple boys.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.199
He's gonna be fine.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.201
In the meantime,
<i>I</i> have made some friends

08:23.203 --> 08:25.804
Who have welcomed me
into the secret world of women.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.639
I am this close to discovering
everything about them.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.975
What they like, what
they don't like.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.177
And where they don't like it.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.213
We're supposed to be here
helping louis make friends.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.048
Oh, please, I see
how you look at laurel.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.551
It's the same way I look at
a five dollar bill in a tip jar

08:39.553 --> 08:41.186
I think I can swap out
for a single.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.188
Okay, what are you
talking about?

08:43.190 --> 08:45.457
That is louis'
friend's mom.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.659
And, yes,
we get along great.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.461
And, yes,
she's pretty and nice.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.663
And, yes, she used to be
a gymnast and can still

08:51.665 --> 08:52.831
Put her legs
behind her head.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.032
And she is out there.

08:54.034 --> 08:57.035
So why am I still standing here,
talking to you?

08:57.037 --> 09:00.205
I can put my legs behind my
head, but you'll never see it.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.209
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:04.211 --> 09:05.810
He was a really
nice guy,
mm-hmm.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.379
And I liked hanging
out with him,

09:07.381 --> 09:08.680
But when we got
to the bedroom,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.682
He was just, well...

09:10.684 --> 09:13.818
If he were a candy bar,
he'd be the fun size.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.820
There's nothing fun
about that.

09:15.822 --> 09:19.224
Yeah, nothing worse
than a small penis.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.293
But, seriously, how
small is too small?

09:22.695 --> 09:24.095
Alan, you are a riot.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.164
We should hang out
with you more often.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.366
Hey, what do you
say, we all go out

09:28.368 --> 09:29.568
This Saturday for
a girls night?

09:29.570 --> 09:31.570
You know, get a limo,
go out dancing,

09:31.572 --> 09:33.038
Wear our sluttiest outfits.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.607
Julie, you can wear what
you're wearing now.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.343
Uh, I'm bad.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.345
Should we go check
on the kids?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.713
Are you kidding?

09:41.715 --> 09:44.716
They're set up with pizza,
popsicles and <i>the lego movie.</i>

09:44.718 --> 09:46.117
For the next two hours,

09:46.119 --> 09:48.019
â™ª everything is awesome.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.022
Yeah, I've seen that
movie, like, five times.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.291
I should really watch it
with louis at some point.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.726
I haven't seen a movie

09:54.728 --> 09:57.295
That wasn't for a kid
in forever.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.297
The other night
I actually had a sex dream

09:59.299 --> 10:01.032
About an animated character.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.401
Whoa...

10:03.403 --> 10:04.402
Prince charming?

10:04.404 --> 10:07.372
The old guy from <i>up.</i>

10:09.375 --> 10:12.444
And, sadly, it was the only sex
I've had in two years.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.879
Well, if it meant a
whole night's sleep,

10:14.881 --> 10:18.450
I'd have sex with an
animated ed asner, too.

10:18.452 --> 10:20.085
You think you're tired now.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.087
You missed the hardest years.

10:22.089 --> 10:25.290
The-the... The picky eating,
the tantrums, the bed-wetting.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.460
Okay, to be fair, I get
all of that with alan.

10:29.895 --> 10:32.297
You guys are a great team.
Hmm.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.832
The only thing
my ex would help with

10:33.834 --> 10:35.767
Was driving the babysitter home.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.335
She'd have the kids
in bed by 8:00

10:37.337 --> 10:39.337
And my husband in bed by 10:00.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.240
Oh... That's horrible.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.908
Is she a good sitter?
'cause we're looking.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.810
Sorry.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.647
Without that jerk of an ex,

10:48.649 --> 10:50.248
I wouldn't have lily,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.417
And even at six years old,
she's my best friend.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.786
I hope I get there
with louis at some point.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.354
You'll get there.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.789
I hope I stay there with lily.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.591
I'm afraid that by the time
she's a teenager,

10:59.593 --> 11:01.526
She'll be like,
"mom, you're 100!

11:01.528 --> 11:03.361
Nobody believes
I'm your sister!"

11:03.363 --> 11:05.430
Okay, how could anyone say that

11:05.432 --> 11:08.967
About someone as pretty,
smart and flexible as you?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.502
(laughs)

11:10.504 --> 11:12.203
You're so sweet.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.838
You don't happen to know

11:13.840 --> 11:16.508
Of a single, straight version
of you, do you?

11:16.510 --> 11:19.344
I used to know one.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.346
Are you looking for a date?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.615
I told you,
it's been over two years.

11:23.617 --> 11:25.684
I need a lot more than a date.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.592
â™ª popsicles are awesome!

11:35.961 --> 11:38.396
Okay, I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.499
I'm gonna wait
here for a bit.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.068
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:46.539 --> 11:48.206
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

11:48.208 --> 11:49.374
Hope you are ready to go.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.675
The ladies just instagrammed

11:50.677 --> 11:52.343
A selfie
from the limo.

11:52.345 --> 11:55.413
#girlsnightout
is on like chaka khan!

11:55.415 --> 11:58.083
All right, louis
is eating his dinner.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.217
Walden:
Oh, great.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.986
Hey, thank you again
for watching him tonight.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.388
And if anything
comes up--

12:03.390 --> 12:05.390
And I mean anything at all--
you call my cell.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.324
Got it.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.326
Oh, if he wants to play a game,

12:08.328 --> 12:09.694
He likes chutes and ladders.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.196
And if he want
to watch a cartoon,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.564
He likes <i>phineas and ferb.</i>

12:12.566 --> 12:16.000
And who does he like in the
cardinals-rams game tonight?

12:16.002 --> 12:17.535
I know I'm being
a little bit crazy,

12:17.537 --> 12:19.537
But this is the first time
I've left him alone.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.773
Relax, I had five kids,

12:21.775 --> 12:24.576
12 grandkids and
four great-grandkids.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.878
I've done it all.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.615
Except teach them
about birth control.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.417
I don't feel good.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.552
Oh, no.
What's the matter?

12:34.554 --> 12:35.854
I just threw up.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.523
Oh, no.
Oh... Yep.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.391
He's got a fever.
(sighs)

12:40.393 --> 12:42.260
I'll bet it was
that snot-nosed kid
on the rock wall.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.295
Typhoid tyler.
Yeah.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.597
I got this.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.433
I worked for charlie
for ten years.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.902
I know vomit.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.239
Cleaning it up
and inducing it.

12:54.241 --> 12:56.641
I never threw up
spaghettios before.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.543
It's kind of fun.
Oh...

12:58.545 --> 12:59.711
(berta laughs)

12:59.713 --> 13:01.045
Should we go
to the doctor?

13:01.047 --> 13:02.046
Oh, no, no.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.448
I'm sure it's
just a tummy ache.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.617
I'll text the girls
and let 'em know
we can't make it.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.585
Oh, no. Come on.
You go.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.820
You sure?

13:08.822 --> 13:10.922
Yeah, come on, this is
what a parent does.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.323
This is what I
signed up for.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.458
Besides, you took
a half an hour

13:13.460 --> 13:14.993
Getting into
those spanx.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.229
All right. Sorry.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.998
Um... I'll send
pictures.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.566
Danielle said that
if I get her drunk enough

13:21.568 --> 13:22.667
She'll show me her tattoos.

13:22.669 --> 13:26.271
Uh, she's got a bird on her hand
and two in her...

13:26.273 --> 13:29.140
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

13:29.142 --> 13:30.675
Walden...

13:30.677 --> 13:32.477
I'm sorry I got sick.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.745
What? Come on, man.

13:33.747 --> 13:34.746
Don't be sorry.

13:34.748 --> 13:35.780
It happens.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.615
<i>I'm</i> sorry you don't feel well.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.484
But you were going
to go out with alan

13:39.486 --> 13:41.085
And now you can't 'cause of me.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.121
Oh, I'm not missing anything.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.190
You ever seen alan dance?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.660
All right.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.928
Now, you get some good sleep

13:49.930 --> 13:52.297
And I'm gonna be right here

13:52.299 --> 13:53.431
If you need anything.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.033
Oh, and you know
who else'll be here?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.235
Your new friend,
"barfy the bucket."

13:58.604 --> 14:00.305
(high-pitched voice):
â™ª I'm here for you

14:00.307 --> 14:02.774
â™ª if you're ready to spew!

14:02.776 --> 14:04.809
(laughs)

14:04.811 --> 14:06.344
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

14:06.346 --> 14:08.413
(doorbell rings)

14:12.551 --> 14:13.551
Hey.

14:13.553 --> 14:14.886
Laurel.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.187
What are you
doing here?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.488
I bailed.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.957
Didn't alan tell you?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.558
No, the only
thing I got

14:20.560 --> 14:22.460
Was a picture of
alan twerking.

14:24.163 --> 14:28.566
With a caption that said,
"alan got his groove back."

14:28.568 --> 14:30.735
Well, when I heard
that louis was sick,

14:30.737 --> 14:32.370
I thought you could
use some help.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.638
And soup.

14:33.640 --> 14:34.839
Come on, that
is so sweet.

14:34.841 --> 14:36.574
You did not
have to do this.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.210
You look amazing.
Oh, thanks.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.645
Well, I already had
the sitter, and...

14:40.647 --> 14:43.715
First rule of parenting:
Never cancel the sitter.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.750
Well, unless she's banging
your husband.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.253
Too far?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.088
No, uh, "too far"

14:50.090 --> 14:51.689
Was starting a facebook page

14:51.691 --> 14:54.826
Called "tiffany jones is a
husband-stealing little bitch."

14:56.762 --> 14:59.530
Uh, do you know what louis has?

14:59.532 --> 15:00.999
Uh, well, I went on the internet

15:01.001 --> 15:03.268
And I've narrowed it down
to either the flu,

15:03.270 --> 15:06.371
Rickets
or early-onset menopause.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.605
Second rule of parenting:

15:07.607 --> 15:09.240
Never consult the internet.

15:09.242 --> 15:10.675
(chuckles)
how's he doing now?

15:10.677 --> 15:12.744
Well, he's asleep

15:12.746 --> 15:13.878
And he's doing
pretty well.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.680
Oh, good, because...

15:15.682 --> 15:18.116
I brought this for us.

15:18.118 --> 15:19.117
Oh...

15:19.119 --> 15:20.785
You know,
third rule of parenting:

15:20.787 --> 15:23.721
Kids aren't the only ones
that can drink from a bottle.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.924
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

15:25.926 --> 15:27.725
â™ª oh, yes, it's ladies' night

15:27.727 --> 15:29.794
â™ª and the feeling's right

15:29.796 --> 15:32.563
â™ª oh, yes, it's ladies' night,
oh, what a night â™ª

15:32.565 --> 15:34.933
(deep voice):
â™ª oh, what a night.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.634
(whooping)

15:36.636 --> 15:37.635
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:37.637 --> 15:38.870
Easy, there.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.371
I pour strong when
the alcohol's free.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.706
I have to cram a lot of fun

15:41.708 --> 15:42.974
Into a short amount of time.
Alan:
Mmm.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.776
Kind of like sex with roger.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.777
(women laughing)

15:45.779 --> 15:47.278
What is it with guys

15:47.280 --> 15:48.746
And their constant need for sex?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.815
Look at alan here.
He's out with two women,

15:50.817 --> 15:52.650
But I bet even he
wants sex right now.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.953
I do. I really do.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.287
Oh, my god!
Let's dance!

15:56.289 --> 15:57.555
(whoops)

15:57.557 --> 15:58.823
(both whooping)

15:58.825 --> 16:00.558
â™ª

16:00.560 --> 16:01.793
Come up here, alan!

16:01.795 --> 16:03.861
No, I-I'm good down here.

16:05.431 --> 16:06.798
Well, he's still asleep

16:06.800 --> 16:08.499
And he feels cooler,

16:08.501 --> 16:10.301
But now I'm worried that
he might have hypothermia.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.736
Yeah.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.338
You know, one of
the hardest lessons

16:13.340 --> 16:14.906
I've had to learn as a parent
is sometimes

16:14.908 --> 16:16.507
You just
gotta relax.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.575
(laughing):
Relax?

16:17.577 --> 16:18.776
All I do is worry.

16:18.778 --> 16:19.978
And now that
I don't sleep,

16:19.980 --> 16:21.746
I have plenty
of time to do it.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.681
Is he exercising enough?

16:23.683 --> 16:25.817
Is he eating right?
Does he even want to stay here?

16:25.819 --> 16:28.519
I mean, this is the most
terrifying thing I've ever done.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.822
And-- this is scarier than
when I bought the big iphone

16:30.824 --> 16:32.824
And I didn't know
if it would fit in my pocket.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.892
(laughs)

16:37.029 --> 16:38.696
You think
you're scared?

16:38.698 --> 16:39.864
I have a daughter.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.833
I worry about
all the same things you do,

16:41.835 --> 16:43.534
Plus penises.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.136
And with you,

16:45.138 --> 16:47.038
You have to worry
about animated penises.

16:48.874 --> 16:50.641
I should have never
told you that.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.543
You should never
tell anyone that.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.013
All right, all right.
What-what's your next date?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.381
Shrek?

16:57.883 --> 16:59.984
No, no, no.
The-the genie from <i>aladdin.</i>

16:59.986 --> 17:01.619
Or-or maybe you'll
have a three-way

17:01.621 --> 17:03.788
With the hakuna matata guys?

17:05.157 --> 17:06.557
Shut up.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.625
Make me.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.994
I could make you.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.696
Oh, yeah?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.031
Mm-hmm.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.866
I'm right here.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.441
I'm so sorry.
What? Why?

17:25.811 --> 17:27.879
You're married.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.747
To a man.
Oh...

17:29.749 --> 17:31.049
That. Uh...

17:31.051 --> 17:32.316
I should go.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.752
No, no, no, no.
No, no, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:34.754 --> 17:37.422
Here's... Okay, the thing
about my marriage is...

17:37.424 --> 17:39.090
I'm not gay.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.159
Does alan know?

17:42.528 --> 17:44.695
His brain knows,

17:44.697 --> 17:47.732
But his heart may not.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.833
Here-here-here,
here's the thing.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.201
Here's the thing:
Alan is...

17:50.203 --> 17:51.669
He's my best
friend, okay?

17:51.671 --> 17:53.071
And-and he married me
as a favor

17:53.073 --> 17:55.673
So it would be easier
to adopt louis.

17:55.675 --> 17:56.741
Okay? And-and...

17:56.743 --> 17:58.843
Well, I mean...
The fact that you

17:58.845 --> 17:59.844
Married your
best friend

17:59.846 --> 18:02.346
So that you could
adopt louis is..

18:02.348 --> 18:04.782
Actually
very sweet.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.185
So...

18:09.788 --> 18:11.756
...You're not
mad at me?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.925
Hakuna matata.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.362
That's my philosophy.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.034
So...

18:24.636 --> 18:26.471
...Can we kiss again?
Yeah.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.142
It's been so long since
I've kissed a man.
Oh...

18:31.144 --> 18:33.144
I wish I could say
the same thing.

18:34.146 --> 18:37.415
Julie, your boobs look
great in that blouse.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.916
I am so jealous.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.284
Thanks to my kids,

18:40.286 --> 18:42.954
Mine went from 34b
to 34 "used to be."

18:42.956 --> 18:44.956
I like your boobs.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.756
I don't know.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.991
What do you think, alan,

18:46.993 --> 18:48.126
Should I get 'em done?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.727
Oh, well, I'm no expert.

18:49.729 --> 18:50.962
I-I think they're lovely.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.163
Are you sure?

18:52.165 --> 18:53.397
Oh, my!

18:53.399 --> 18:55.099
You just did that.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.668
Um, you guys, I-I think there's
something I should tell you...

18:57.670 --> 18:58.903
He has nothing
to compare them with.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.971
Here.

19:02.674 --> 19:05.243
You guys are my best friends.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.477
Aw!
Aw!

19:06.479 --> 19:08.479
Okay, okay.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.848
I-I know you haven't
done this in a while,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.850
So I don't want
to go too fast,

19:12.852 --> 19:14.285
But do you want
to go up to my...

19:14.287 --> 19:15.119
Let's go.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.488
Oh.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.191
Louis (over walkie-talkie):
Walden?

19:20.193 --> 19:21.726
Can you come here?

19:23.095 --> 19:25.329
He didn't say "over,"
so it doesn't count.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.999
Oh, go check on him.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.534
It's fine.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.636
I've waited for two years,
I can wait a little bit longer.

19:31.638 --> 19:34.505
Thank you.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.542
Oh. Don't start without me.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.210
Or do.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.546
Oh, uh, by the way,
if you want to stay in the mood,

19:41.548 --> 19:43.614
We get all the cartoon channels.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.119
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:00.299 --> 20:02.033
Walden?

20:11.343 --> 20:12.910
Parenting rule number four:

20:12.912 --> 20:15.179
Sleep is better than sex.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.614
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

20:19.885 --> 20:22.320
This is the best night
of my life.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.589
I love you girls.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.325
We should get matching tattoos.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.026
I have a better idea.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.061
Let's go to a strip club!

20:30.063 --> 20:32.830
That is better!

20:32.832 --> 20:35.099
(whooping)

20:35.101 --> 20:38.002
â™ª oh, yes,
it's ladies' night... â™ª

20:39.938 --> 20:42.006
This was a great idea.

20:44.376 --> 20:47.211
That is definitely
bigger than fun size.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.946
Make it rain!

20:48.948 --> 20:50.648
Yeah, give him
some money!

20:51.617 --> 20:55.686
Oh, this just keeps
getting better.
