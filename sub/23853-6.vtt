WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:03.154
Dad, we have to get you out of here.

00:03.164 --> 00:04.364
The woman is a monster.

00:04.374 --> 00:06.036
This all stops, today.

00:06.046 --> 00:08.114
- Stupid bitch.
- Please don't go. Please.

00:08.124 --> 00:09.659
Withdrawing from lithium... no joke.

00:09.669 --> 00:11.534
- We're talking tremors...
- I understand.

00:11.544 --> 00:14.284
That's exactly why I have him here,
so I can keep an eye on him.

00:14.294 --> 00:16.251
I really like your cabin, by the way.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.566
I think it could be really good.

00:17.576 --> 00:19.502
You know, for both of us.

00:19.512 --> 00:22.205
No. What? No, no, no, no. Chet.

00:22.215 --> 00:24.007
- I miss you.
- I know.

00:24.017 --> 00:25.341
Sissy Bounce came from Xavier.

00:25.351 --> 00:27.097
I wouldn't even know what it is
without him.

00:27.108 --> 00:28.972
- Who the hell's Xavier?
- He's my boyfriend.

00:28.983 --> 00:31.261
I always just imagined he'd
be a big part of the show.

00:31.272 --> 00:32.925
Yeah, that's a sticky one. For you.

00:32.936 --> 00:35.050
I need more cocaine. I cannot do this.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.919
What are you doing?

00:36.929 --> 00:40.330
You give me something,
I give you something.

00:42.225 --> 00:43.449
Jasper's here on a bet.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.051
He gets $400,000

00:45.061 --> 00:46.886
if he's the first one to sleep with you.

00:46.896 --> 00:48.604
Wait. I really need to speak to you.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.990
Oh, what, about the bet?
Yeah, I know all about it.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.060
You lost. I slept
with the jockey night one.

00:54.070 --> 00:57.897
I know that you've been stealing
$18 million from me and Chet.

00:57.907 --> 00:59.766
You're gonna pick up
"Passport to Dance,"

00:59.776 --> 01:02.802
and you're going to give us four
shows by the end of the year.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.305
I made $9 million today.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.572
To $9 million.

01:06.582 --> 01:08.415
To $9 million.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.677
I'm glad you're doing well, Dad.

01:11.687 --> 01:13.980
Well, I feel surprisingly good.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.748
I'm just so grateful, Rach.

01:15.758 --> 01:18.818
You did for me what I could
never have done for myself.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.753
You got me out.

01:20.763 --> 01:22.429
Thank you.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.826
Okay, let's keep a low profile today.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.494
I just wanna keep you close

01:28.504 --> 01:30.863
until you finish
tapering off those meds,

01:30.873 --> 01:33.507
but I am working on a plan.

01:33.518 --> 01:35.133
You're sure it's okay for me to be here?

01:35.143 --> 01:37.502
Yes, of course. Come on. You're my dad.

01:37.512 --> 01:40.513
All right. What do you say,
should I get us some breakfast?

01:41.829 --> 01:43.807
You and me, lox and bagels,
like we used to?

01:43.818 --> 01:45.476
- Lox and bagels?
- Mr. Goldberg?

01:45.487 --> 01:46.945
Jeremy!

01:47.963 --> 01:49.014
Hey!

01:49.024 --> 01:50.349
How are you? Good to see ya.

01:50.359 --> 01:51.850
Uh, you too.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.785
Uh, what brings you to "Everlasting"?

01:53.795 --> 01:55.219
Just visiting.

01:55.229 --> 01:56.440
- At 6:00 a.m.?
- Yeah.

01:56.451 --> 01:59.289
Dad, why don't you head in?
I'll get those bagels.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.459
Okay. Jeremy, good to see you.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.002
You, too.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.633
Rachel, is he staying with you?
In your truck?

02:10.314 --> 02:11.893
It's complicated.

02:13.253 --> 02:16.393
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:16.750 --> 02:19.484
What's going on? You okay?

02:20.554 --> 02:22.487
Please don't say anything.

02:28.728 --> 02:31.421
And then at the end,
the winning team escapes,

02:31.431 --> 02:32.855
hence "escape room."

02:32.865 --> 02:34.391
It's really hot right now.

02:34.401 --> 02:35.992
Yeah. No.

02:36.002 --> 02:37.693
'80s-themed Tahoe ski weekend?

02:37.703 --> 02:40.496
Serena, what do you want to do?

02:40.506 --> 02:41.764
Thank you for asking, Rachel.

02:41.774 --> 02:46.335
I would like to sit with the
guys, one-on-one, and talk.

02:46.345 --> 02:48.370
- Just talk.
- Talk?

02:48.380 --> 02:51.388
Yeah. I want unlimited time to get
to know who these guys really are.

02:51.399 --> 02:53.542
Yeah honey, Quinn's not
really gonna go for that.

02:53.553 --> 02:55.167
That sounds great, actually. Love it.

02:55.178 --> 02:56.401
- Are you crazy?
- Thank you.

02:56.412 --> 02:58.347
Hey, hi. Thank you so much
for calling me back.

02:58.357 --> 03:00.749
We spoke a few weeks ago
about the cabin at Mount Hood?

03:00.759 --> 03:02.184
Yeah, it was 6 weeks ago.

03:02.194 --> 03:03.561
When I never heard back from you,

03:03.572 --> 03:04.954
I just assumed you weren't interested.

03:04.964 --> 03:06.956
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm still really interested.

03:06.966 --> 03:09.959
Well, I got a couple willing
to buy it now at above asking.

03:09.969 --> 03:11.626
Um, hey, look.

03:11.636 --> 03:13.528
Can I just, like, try
speaking to the owner

03:13.538 --> 03:15.496
like five minutes,
just so I can explain to them

03:15.507 --> 03:18.099
how much this place means to me?

03:18.109 --> 03:19.468
Please.

03:19.478 --> 03:21.269
I'll see what I can do.

03:21.279 --> 03:23.371
Interviews? That's boring.

03:23.381 --> 03:25.406
She just wants to "talk"?!

03:25.416 --> 03:27.442
Who would ever sign off on that?

03:27.452 --> 03:29.277
Um, that one right there.

03:29.287 --> 03:30.644
- Rachel!
- Yeah?

03:30.654 --> 03:32.981
So, you sanctioned today's snooze-fest?

03:32.991 --> 03:34.602
I mean, like I had a choice.

03:34.613 --> 03:36.784
Serena completely despises us right now.

03:36.794 --> 03:38.650
I mean, this was the only way
to calm her down

03:38.661 --> 03:40.721
- and make her think she's in control.
- Okay, fine.

03:40.731 --> 03:42.756
But then what am I going
to put on television

03:42.766 --> 03:44.434
that people are actually
going to want to watch?

03:44.445 --> 03:46.794
Don't worry. She's gonna do
these dumb interviews,

03:46.804 --> 03:48.348
and then we'll make her pick some guy.

03:48.359 --> 03:50.832
She's gonna have this, like,
uber romantic one-on-one date.

03:50.843 --> 03:53.100
In a few hours, this place is gonna be.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.902
- "Everlasting" on 'roids.
- All right, look.

03:54.912 --> 03:57.571
I-I just... I want a romance
explosion, all right?

03:57.581 --> 04:00.774
Flowers, candles, and somebody's
tongue down someone's throat!

04:00.784 --> 04:02.142
I'm on it.

04:02.152 --> 04:04.144
Look, it's not working.

04:04.154 --> 04:06.313
Sure, Serena's the Feminist Suitress...

04:06.323 --> 04:08.581
tough career woman finds love, I get it.

04:08.591 --> 04:10.660
Okay, this is premium, elevated...

04:10.671 --> 04:13.020
- An Emmy?
- That is our long game.

04:13.030 --> 04:15.989
But right now, we need eyes on the show.

04:15.999 --> 04:19.326
We need to get the word out
that we are pushing boundaries.

04:19.336 --> 04:21.059
I like it. What are you thinking?

04:21.070 --> 04:23.997
Something buzzy, unexpected,
headline-worthy.

04:24.007 --> 04:26.165
A scandal with a dark secret,

04:26.175 --> 04:29.769
but enough "Everlasting" romance
to keep things wet.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.337
I'm about to explode.

04:31.347 --> 04:33.640
That sounds so good. What is it?

04:33.650 --> 04:36.175
You tell me, Mr. Zeitgeist.

04:36.185 --> 04:40.312
'Cause once we find it, we're golden.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.569
- Rachel.
- Yes.

04:41.580 --> 04:42.681
How's your dad?

04:42.691 --> 04:43.949
He's, uh, great, actually.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.551
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:45.561 --> 04:47.853
No withdrawal symptoms yet?
Dizziness, agitation, tremors?

04:47.863 --> 04:49.221
No. He's reading and resting.

04:49.231 --> 04:50.956
Okay. Well, it's only been 24 hours.

04:50.966 --> 04:53.403
We still don't know what's coming.
Listen, um...

04:55.005 --> 04:56.728
I got the name of a place.

04:56.738 --> 04:58.864
It's not far away.

04:58.874 --> 05:01.166
You could visit.
He could get real supervision.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.334
It's pricy, but I think it's worth it.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.038
I'm telling you, we don't need it.

05:06.048 --> 05:08.840
You should see him. He's better
than he's been in years.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.709
This is absolutely
the right thing to do.

05:11.719 --> 05:14.245
- Okay, get it! Get it! Mine!
- Okay.

05:14.255 --> 05:17.748
All right. You, uh,
come up with anything?

05:17.758 --> 05:20.552
You know, each one of these guys
is a potential story.

05:20.562 --> 05:24.330
We just have to point a camera
at them and find it.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.069
Dad?!

05:33.708 --> 05:35.165
- Dan, hey.
- Yeah?

05:35.175 --> 05:37.211
Have you, um... Have you seen
an older guy around?

05:37.222 --> 05:38.601
- Like Gary?
- No, no. Not Gary.

05:38.612 --> 05:40.337
A guy in a brown jacket.

05:40.347 --> 05:42.272
- Um, has anybody seen...
- No, Dan. Forget it.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.541
Just don't say anything.

05:44.551 --> 05:47.244
Okay! Let's, uh, break up into teams...

05:47.254 --> 05:49.713
the shirts versus the skins!

05:49.723 --> 05:52.516
- There you go.
- Actually, he meant skins versus skins.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.218
All right, everyone's shirts off!

05:54.228 --> 05:56.593
Wardrobe, take their shirts!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

05:56.604 --> 05:58.189
Hey! Where is Jeremy?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.988
We gotta be getting
this on film. This is...

05:59.999 --> 06:01.452
Um, I think he's at the camera truck.

06:01.463 --> 06:03.956
- You want me to get him?
- No, there's no time, okay?

06:03.967 --> 06:05.729
So, today's your lucky day,
Peppermint Patty.

06:05.739 --> 06:07.130
Let's roll. Get it up on your shoulder.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.265
Copy. Come on, come on.

06:09.275 --> 06:11.175
Excuse me.

06:15.314 --> 06:16.514
Rachel?

06:17.688 --> 06:19.247
- Yeah.
- Hey, what's going on?

06:19.257 --> 06:20.881
Nothing.

06:20.900 --> 06:23.298
Does this have something to do
with your dad?

06:24.587 --> 06:27.123
I... I just... I can't
find him. I'm really worried.

06:27.134 --> 06:28.889
Quinn really just can't know
that he's here.

06:29.236 --> 06:31.361
He's coming off his meds.

06:32.383 --> 06:35.351
Go. I'll watch the monitors.
You go find him.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:47.384 --> 06:50.518
Whoo!

06:52.489 --> 06:54.714
So, which one of these guys

06:54.724 --> 06:58.452
has a deep, dark, buzz-worthy secret?

06:58.462 --> 07:02.155
August is an open book,
so no secrets there.

07:02.165 --> 07:04.868
Uh, Jasper.

07:04.879 --> 07:06.459
No, not Jasper.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.894
We can't reveal the bet yet.

07:07.904 --> 07:09.665
And plus, he's still a wifey, all right?

07:09.676 --> 07:11.598
We need somebody
who is not gonna mess up

07:11.608 --> 07:12.832
the long game with Serena.

07:12.842 --> 07:14.100
I got it!

07:21.762 --> 07:23.428
That'll work.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.613
<i> Rachel to Serena's room. Stat.</i>

07:27.623 --> 07:29.648
Oh, God.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.521
Can't even take
a shower in privacy?

07:31.532 --> 07:33.412
Can one of you, like,
stand and guard the door

07:33.423 --> 07:34.756
- so I can wash...
- What? What happened?

07:34.767 --> 07:35.975
I was in the middle of a shower,

07:35.986 --> 07:37.498
and this guy just wondered into my room!

07:37.509 --> 07:38.924
Rach! Look, I am so sorry.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.986
I just... I just wanted
to find a bathroom,

07:40.997 --> 07:43.092
and then I got turned around,
and this place is so huge.

07:43.103 --> 07:44.389
Rachel, you know this guy?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.698
Uh, hey! What is going on here?

07:46.708 --> 07:48.600
So you're Quinn, huh?

07:48.610 --> 07:50.936
Yeah, I heard so much about you.

07:50.946 --> 07:53.958
That's creepy.
Okay. Who the hell are you?

07:53.969 --> 07:55.535
Yeah, I would like to know, too.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.851
This is my dad.

08:01.477 --> 08:03.802
Why the hell is your dad on the set?

08:03.820 --> 08:06.203
He... Look, he's just visiting
for the day.

08:06.213 --> 08:08.181
Oh, really? Is your mom gonna join him?

08:08.191 --> 08:10.216
- 'Cause I'll go get my battle armor.
- No, okay?

08:10.226 --> 08:13.619
This is just some long-overdue
father-daughter bonding time, you know?

08:13.629 --> 08:15.388
No, I don't know, Rachel.

08:15.398 --> 08:17.490
Having quality father-daughter time

08:17.500 --> 08:19.959
on the set of "Everlasting"?
That makes no sense.

08:19.969 --> 08:21.995
Okay. Look, I am so sorry
that he got in the way.

08:22.005 --> 08:24.867
I promise you won't see him again, okay?

08:24.878 --> 08:27.700
But maybe after the interviews,
Madison could cover the one-on-one.

08:27.710 --> 08:29.023
Absolutely not.

08:29.034 --> 08:32.258
You can do "Take Your Daddy
To Work Day" some other time.

08:32.269 --> 08:34.373
I need you on that date
and I need you focused.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.708
Okay. It's fine. I just thought
that you and Madison...

08:36.719 --> 08:39.344
No, Madison may be able to screw her way

08:39.354 --> 08:41.078
into useful information,

08:41.089 --> 08:43.304
but she cannot perform your voodoo.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.867
You said you wanted to find Serena love,

08:45.878 --> 08:47.727
so go find it for her.

08:49.752 --> 08:52.979
That wedding you did with that
Adam guy a couple seasons ago...

08:52.989 --> 08:54.515
I never saw it coming.

08:54.525 --> 08:56.483
Are you kidding me? You watch the show?

08:56.493 --> 09:00.047
Eh... Don't tell your mother.

09:00.058 --> 09:03.656
No, I mean, y-you're not there to
talk to. It's the next best thing.

09:03.666 --> 09:05.325
But now I get to see you do it
in person.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.860
I am so thrilled.

09:07.870 --> 09:11.487
Can I, you know, stay and watch
for a little while?

09:11.498 --> 09:13.266
Come on, please?

09:13.276 --> 09:15.235
- Okay, for a little while.
- Okay, thanks.

09:15.245 --> 09:18.037
<i>We need Alexi at makeup and hair.</i>

09:18.047 --> 09:19.906
Hey! Bom, bom!

09:19.916 --> 09:21.541
What you think?

09:21.551 --> 09:24.243
Russian James Bond.

09:24.253 --> 09:25.945
Look.

09:25.955 --> 09:28.581
Whatever happened between us,
it cannot happen again.

09:28.591 --> 09:31.851
I have a boyfriend, and you are
here to date a woman.

09:31.861 --> 09:34.119
Actually, I think that now
I'm here just to do.

09:34.129 --> 09:35.520
"Dance for Passport," no?

09:35.530 --> 09:37.222
It's "Passport to Dance."

09:37.232 --> 09:38.723
Same-same.

09:38.733 --> 09:42.361
The point is, we are working
together so gorgeously,

09:42.371 --> 09:43.795
why mess with success?

09:43.805 --> 09:46.932
- No, I can't.
- I need refill.

09:46.942 --> 09:48.733
Already?

09:49.476 --> 09:51.234
No. No way.

09:51.245 --> 09:53.891
Yes way. It will be worth it.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.669
Trust me.

09:56.032 --> 09:57.555
There you are!

09:57.954 --> 09:59.758
Xavier, what are you doing here?

09:59.769 --> 10:02.046
Making sure you eat something
healthy for a change.

10:02.056 --> 10:05.283
Hey, Sissy Boy!
He should be on our show.

10:05.293 --> 10:06.550
It's perfect.

10:07.169 --> 10:08.453
What, "Everlasting"?

10:08.463 --> 10:10.754
No, no, no. This "Passport for Dance."

10:10.772 --> 10:13.107
What are you talking about?
That's <i> our</i> show.

10:14.768 --> 10:16.002
Right?

10:18.428 --> 10:19.794
I need touch-up.

10:22.635 --> 10:24.293
What the hell's going on, Jay?

10:24.303 --> 10:28.167
Alexi's an international star who
can bring eyeballs to the show.

10:28.177 --> 10:30.611
So, is he a producer?

10:30.621 --> 10:32.456
He's the host.

10:32.931 --> 10:34.975
- I thought I was...
- Look, I'm trying to get you

10:34.986 --> 10:36.517
approved as a segment host, okay?

10:36.528 --> 10:39.128
I'm doing everything I can to
keep you involved here.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.629
How long have you known about this?

10:44.823 --> 10:46.615
Since before the pitch.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.416
- When were you gonna say something?
- Xave, I wanted to...

10:48.426 --> 10:51.035
Jay, we really need your help
with these interviews, okay?

10:51.046 --> 10:52.054
I have to...

10:52.064 --> 10:54.325
Are you seriously gonna walk
away from me right now?

10:54.336 --> 10:55.923
I am at work, Xave.

10:55.933 --> 10:57.959
I have to work.

10:58.906 --> 11:01.437
We'll talk about this later.

11:05.601 --> 11:08.670
The architecture of romance
must be built

11:08.680 --> 11:13.417
upon a bedrock of trust,
knowledge, and understanding.

11:13.428 --> 11:16.387
And today, Serena wants to investigate

11:16.398 --> 11:18.846
<i>what these men are really made of.</i>

11:18.856 --> 11:21.448
Charlie Rose
clipping his toenails from jail

11:21.458 --> 11:23.172
would get better ratings than this!

11:23.183 --> 11:25.437
Plug these in, there you go,
so you can listen, okay?

11:25.448 --> 11:26.688
- Thank you.
- Sure, of course.

11:26.699 --> 11:28.373
Hey, Rachel. Do you have a minute?

11:28.384 --> 11:30.251
Yes, of course.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.608
So, look. I know I'm Madison's guy.

11:34.619 --> 11:37.288
But you seem to know Serena
better than anybody else here.

11:37.299 --> 11:39.833
And to be honest, I'm not
getting any traction with her.

11:39.843 --> 11:42.190
I'm not gonna come up with
a joke for this interview, so...

11:42.201 --> 11:44.296
Seriously, don't even
worry about a joke, okay?

11:44.307 --> 11:46.694
You just do what you do best.
You're an amazing guy.

11:46.705 --> 11:50.476
Okay. Rolling on Alexi
interview in three, two...

11:50.486 --> 11:54.600
<i>So, Alexi. Tell me about your
history with substance abuse.</i>

11:54.611 --> 11:57.383
- Sorry?
- Your very public drug problem.

11:57.393 --> 11:59.552
Oh, that.

11:59.562 --> 12:02.522
No, no, no, no, no.
Drugs are so bye-bye.

12:02.532 --> 12:04.290
Now my only drug...

12:05.314 --> 12:06.367
is love.

12:09.236 --> 12:11.030
Oh, you.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.532
<i>So, Owen.</i>

12:12.542 --> 12:14.734
What would you do differently
in a second marriage?

12:14.744 --> 12:16.322
I'd make sure that I was there for it.

12:16.333 --> 12:18.529
<i>Family is the most important
thing in the world to me.</i>

12:18.540 --> 12:19.905
Oh, Lord.

12:19.915 --> 12:23.183
So, August, how many women
have you slept with?

12:24.419 --> 12:27.020
Oh, hello!

12:33.293 --> 12:34.950
Hey, can you cover me for five?

12:34.976 --> 12:36.534
Do I have a choice?

12:36.544 --> 12:38.369
Dad, are you gonna be
okay here for a few?

12:38.379 --> 12:39.805
Oh, I'm great. I'm great. I'm great.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.230
Okay. Excuse me. I'll be right back.

12:41.241 --> 12:43.808
<i> My idea of a perfect day?</i>
First, we wake up with the sun.

12:43.819 --> 12:45.871
To the sweet smell of cowboy perfume.

12:45.882 --> 12:48.612
- What's cowboy perfume?
- That's horse manure.

12:48.623 --> 12:50.881
Just an old rancher joke.

12:50.891 --> 12:53.083
- You ready for this?
- So ready.

12:53.093 --> 12:54.585
Mmm. Mmm!

12:54.595 --> 12:56.421
I look forward to hearing your decision.

12:56.431 --> 13:00.124
You know what? I think my, uh...
I think my mouth just decided.

13:00.134 --> 13:02.259
No. No. Actually, no, Serena, hold on.

13:02.269 --> 13:04.612
Um, you still need to hear from Jasper.

13:04.623 --> 13:06.664
<i>No, I don't. I don't need
to hear from anyone else.</i>

13:06.674 --> 13:08.377
<i>I choose Guy!</i> CHET: No, no, no, no!

13:08.388 --> 13:10.861
She can't! She can't choose Guy.
Guy's gotta stay back here

13:10.872 --> 13:12.393
and have a gay love affair with Warren.

13:12.404 --> 13:14.496
Relax, Chet, all right?

13:14.507 --> 13:17.346
She just gave us a love triangle.

13:20.275 --> 13:23.064
Look, to be honest with you, this
cabin is what's kept me going.

13:23.075 --> 13:25.257
And now, it just really means
more to me than ever.

13:25.268 --> 13:26.455
I mean, to me and my dad.

13:26.466 --> 13:28.819
He's gonna come and help me get
settled, fix the place...

13:28.829 --> 13:31.010
<i>Listen, that's sweet and all,</i>

13:31.021 --> 13:33.580
<i>but this other couple
offered above asking.</i>

13:33.591 --> 13:36.861
Okay. W-What if I get you
$75,000 cash tomorrow?

13:36.872 --> 13:39.775
And I can get you the other half
in a month once I finish this job.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.205
<i>Full cash offer?</i>

13:41.216 --> 13:43.142
<i>Now you're speaking my language.</i>

13:43.153 --> 13:45.245
<i>How about you give me the day?</i>

13:45.256 --> 13:46.722
Okay.

13:53.519 --> 13:55.119
Hey.

13:56.692 --> 13:58.317
Look, I'm really sorry, babe.

13:58.327 --> 13:59.879
All the time I've been cooking for you,

13:59.890 --> 14:02.637
making a home, figuring out how
to tell your mom about us...

14:03.481 --> 14:05.156
all that time, you knew?

14:05.166 --> 14:07.158
Okay, look, Xave, um,

14:07.168 --> 14:09.160
I-I can get you a finder's fee.

14:09.170 --> 14:11.663
It's not a lot, I know, but,
Xave, that's the business.

14:11.673 --> 14:13.631
It's not about...

14:13.641 --> 14:16.418
It's not about the business, Jay!

14:16.429 --> 14:19.665
It's about you lying to the one
person who showed up for you.

14:20.707 --> 14:23.243
Are you sleeping with him, too?
I-Is that why you're doing this?

14:23.254 --> 14:24.508
O-Or maybe that's what
you're hoping for.

14:24.518 --> 14:26.010
No! Stop.

14:26.020 --> 14:28.817
I moved my life out here for you, Jay.

14:28.828 --> 14:30.153
I gave up everything.

14:31.309 --> 14:32.598
Yeah?

14:33.227 --> 14:36.820
Well, I never <i> asked</i> you to. And
honestly, Xave, it's a little much.

14:36.830 --> 14:39.357
Like, showing up at my work unannounced,

14:39.367 --> 14:42.192
moving in, like, surprising me
with protein shakes and shit.

14:42.202 --> 14:45.837
Can you just chill for like
one second, seriously?

14:47.674 --> 14:49.266
Maybe I should go home.

14:49.276 --> 14:50.734
Yeah, maybe you should.

14:50.744 --> 14:52.836
I meant to New Orleans, Jay.

14:52.846 --> 14:56.815
I know. I think maybe
this whole thing was a mistake.

15:04.090 --> 15:05.582
I don't know.

15:05.592 --> 15:07.350
I'm not really sure
if it's my style, Zach.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.286
It looks good.

15:09.296 --> 15:12.127
Maybe I should give it to my daughter...
You know Rachel, my daughter?

15:12.138 --> 15:14.957
Know her? I live in
constant fear of Rachel.

15:14.967 --> 15:16.793
- That's a compliment.
- Oh, yeah?

15:16.803 --> 15:18.961
Yes, sir. She's a force of nature.

15:18.971 --> 15:21.563
Keep the hat.
I think I'm gonna widen my demo.

15:21.573 --> 15:23.671
I can't believe you don't have
one of those already.

15:23.682 --> 15:26.535
Yeah. Well, it's a whole
new world there, Rach.

15:26.545 --> 15:28.771
Hey, Dad. I'm so sorry
I have to go on this date.

15:28.781 --> 15:31.358
- I'd much rather be here with you.
- No, I'll be fine. You just...

15:31.369 --> 15:34.110
You do your work, all right?
I'm so proud of you.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.519
- I'll see you soon?
- Okay.

16:12.118 --> 16:15.378
All right, let's serve up this beefcake
and see if Serena takes a bite!

16:15.388 --> 16:17.815
Let's roll cameras!
Bring the talent in, please!

16:17.825 --> 16:19.946
- And...
- Get down, get down!

16:19.957 --> 16:21.556
here we go, and action!

16:24.064 --> 16:25.322
This'll do.

16:25.793 --> 16:27.050
Restaurant's not bad, either.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.452
Can I take this for you?

16:28.462 --> 16:29.720
Thank you.

16:29.731 --> 16:31.097
After you.

16:33.347 --> 16:36.593
Such a gentleman. Why am I sitting?

16:36.603 --> 16:39.129
I thought you were gonna teach
me how to cook some things.

16:39.139 --> 16:42.407
I will. I just wanted to do this first.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.804
I'm sorry. I just...

16:46.814 --> 16:48.237
You look so amazing.

16:48.247 --> 16:50.106
I just kinda wanted
to skip all five courses

16:50.116 --> 16:53.376
- and jump straight to dessert.
- Well, we will get there.

16:53.386 --> 16:56.245
Uh, Just, let's start with the
appetizer and really savor it.

16:56.255 --> 16:58.782
- Coming right up.
- All right, and cut!

16:58.792 --> 17:01.091
Let's start getting ready
for some food prep.

17:07.313 --> 17:08.945
Working it out, huh?

17:09.301 --> 17:11.961
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

17:11.971 --> 17:13.595
You just seem a little stressed out,

17:13.605 --> 17:16.498
that's all, you know.
Not that I blame you.

17:16.508 --> 17:18.099
You don't stand a chance with her.

17:18.109 --> 17:21.002
Now might be time to consider
bowing out gracefully.

17:21.012 --> 17:25.390
Please. I didn't get
to where I am by giving up.

17:25.401 --> 17:27.075
Yeah? I thought you got
to where you were

17:27.085 --> 17:30.078
by being a rich white dude from England.

17:30.088 --> 17:33.056
Well... doesn't hurt.

17:36.328 --> 17:38.954
I felt like I needed
to get you out of the mansion.

17:38.964 --> 17:40.521
I feel bad for you, Warren.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.624
Oh, yeah? Now, why's that?

17:43.634 --> 17:46.828
I mean, I'm pretty kick-ass,
if I do humbly say so m'self.

17:46.838 --> 17:48.330
Well, I agree.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.698
And that is why it feels so awful

17:50.708 --> 17:54.134
that Serena hasn't really
given you a chance.

17:54.144 --> 17:56.804
Yeah. You know, some days,
I don't even see her.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.940
I mean, what do you do all day?

17:59.950 --> 18:02.042
Just chill with my roommate, mostly.

18:02.052 --> 18:05.346
- And who's that again?
- It's the cooker dude, Guy.

18:05.356 --> 18:07.515
- Mm.
- Yeah, he's great.

18:07.525 --> 18:09.517
The other night we stayed up
till like 3:00 a.m.

18:09.527 --> 18:11.118
just playing cards,

18:11.128 --> 18:13.888
and he made us
these fancy little pancakes.

18:13.898 --> 18:16.623
- Mmm.
- That sounds fantastic.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.893
You know, I gotta say,

18:18.903 --> 18:20.895
I never met no one like Guy before.

18:21.789 --> 18:23.505
Really?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.566
- Chet.
- What?

18:26.576 --> 18:28.333
Hey. What are you doing here?

18:28.344 --> 18:30.185
I'm a producer. I work here.
Listen, listen.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.706
Okay, hey. If you want to take
this and run with your vision,

18:32.717 --> 18:34.490
it's totally fine by me.
I can just head out.

18:34.501 --> 18:37.002
Rachel, we both have jobs to do.

18:39.656 --> 18:43.049
Yeah. I mean, this show just
does crazy things to your head.

18:43.059 --> 18:45.684
But when I come back to
my room and there's Guy,

18:45.694 --> 18:48.321
just a big old smile on his face
with a cup of that mint tea

18:48.331 --> 18:50.723
he makes for me, just a
drop of honey in there

18:50.733 --> 18:53.993
and a slice of this really
delicious date-nut bread,

18:54.003 --> 18:56.237
mmm, he's amazing.

18:58.107 --> 19:01.166
Warren...

19:01.176 --> 19:02.371
are you gay?

19:03.712 --> 19:04.832
What?

19:05.548 --> 19:07.205
Where the hell’s that come from?

19:07.215 --> 19:09.575
Well, I mean, you're talking
about fancy little pancakes

19:09.585 --> 19:12.177
and drops of honey.
I mean, not judging at all.

19:12.187 --> 19:14.046
So, what, you see "Brokeback
Mountain" one time

19:14.056 --> 19:16.949
and suddenly you think all
good-looking single cowboys are gay?

19:16.959 --> 19:18.417
Well, not <i> all</i> of them.

19:18.427 --> 19:20.252
But I-I mean, if you want to get

19:20.262 --> 19:22.971
something off your chest,
this is a great opportunity.

19:22.982 --> 19:24.494
And you'd only have to come out once,

19:24.505 --> 19:27.100
- because everyone would have seen it.
- Damn it, I'm not gay!

19:31.573 --> 19:36.701
Well, Mr. Straight Cowboy,
you don't have to convince me.

19:36.711 --> 19:38.235
You need to convince Serena.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.377
Well, where's she at?
I'll tell her right now.

19:42.550 --> 19:44.542
Oh, that sauce smells so good!

19:44.552 --> 19:46.310
- Yeah, right?
- Can I taste it?

19:46.320 --> 19:47.445
- Nope.
- Please?

19:47.455 --> 19:48.913
No, it's not ready yet.

19:48.923 --> 19:50.314
<i>Well, then, put me to work, Chef.</i>

19:50.324 --> 19:51.648
Okay. Now she's getting into it.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.749
<i>Look, you said it yourself.</i>

19:52.759 --> 19:55.252
Let's just... savor

19:55.262 --> 19:58.089
each of these courses first.

19:58.099 --> 20:00.958
Well, what if I'm... tired of waiting?

20:00.968 --> 20:03.294
- Everybody freeze! Nobody move!
- What?

20:03.304 --> 20:06.229
Just kidding! I ain't robbing y'all.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.064
Just always wanted to holler that.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.100
Go, go, go. Guy, where are you?!

20:10.110 --> 20:11.635
Right here. What are you doing here?

20:11.645 --> 20:13.689
Serena...

20:13.700 --> 20:15.806
- I told the crew the plan.
- I hope this gets crazy.

20:15.816 --> 20:17.674
I just want to put
these hands all over you.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.143
- Okay, um...
- I can't stop thinking about you.

20:20.153 --> 20:22.612
- I dream about you.
- What are you two doing?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.856
We're just gathering, you know,
alternative facts.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.681
Hey, listen. I'm all for secret plans,
as long as I know what they are.

20:27.692 --> 20:29.252
Otherwise, I'm just wasting my time

20:29.262 --> 20:31.421
- when I should be with my dad.
- Oh, relax, Rachel.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.589
Your dad survived your mom for 30 years.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.492
He can make it a couple more hours.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.593
- Quinn...
- How much have you been drinking?

20:37.613 --> 20:39.785
You can't just storm in
here and propose to the girl

20:39.796 --> 20:42.364
<i>- I'm on a date with!
- Guess what?! I just did!</i>

20:42.374 --> 20:44.133
<i>I can't believe you'd do this to me.</i>

20:44.143 --> 20:46.101
<i>We're supposed to be going
through this together.</i>

20:46.111 --> 20:48.470
- <i>We're on the same team.</i>
- Oh, God. Excuse me.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.706
I need you to know, and I will
whoop your ass, bitch!

20:50.716 --> 20:53.375
This is crazy. You should know
how I feel about you, dude.

20:53.385 --> 20:55.877
So, what, this is just another
stupid rigged moment?

20:55.887 --> 20:58.300
Yeah, Serena, I swear I had,
like, nothing to do with this.

20:58.311 --> 21:00.412
Oh, yeah, right. I don't believe you.

21:00.423 --> 21:02.893
You have lost all credibility.
You don't give a shit about me.

21:02.904 --> 21:04.486
Okay, that's not true.

21:04.496 --> 21:07.622
I've treated you better than anyone
that's come on this show, ever.

21:07.632 --> 21:08.764
I'm trying to protect you.

21:08.775 --> 21:10.527
I mean, it may not feel like
that, but I am.

21:10.538 --> 21:12.386
Yeah? So, why didn't you
tell me about Jasper?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.029
Look, Jasper... He had no idea

21:14.039 --> 21:15.496
who you were when he made that bet.

21:15.506 --> 21:18.166
He came on the show,
he actually fell for you,

21:18.176 --> 21:20.334
and like it or not, he's a great option.

21:20.344 --> 21:21.903
I didn't want you to screw that up.

21:21.913 --> 21:23.471
Because I'm just too
dumb to understand...

21:23.481 --> 21:26.307
You know what, Serena?
I have got so much going on.

21:26.317 --> 21:28.909
- I am a person. I'm not just a job.
- This isn't about <i> your</i> life

21:28.919 --> 21:31.179
- or whatever's going on with your dad.
- Right, look.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.714
I have put my entire life
on indefinite hold

21:33.724 --> 21:36.417
for this show, for you, Serena.
So you know what?

21:36.427 --> 21:39.253
I am so sorry if things
aren't as picture-perfect

21:39.263 --> 21:41.330
as you seem to believe you are.

22:00.855 --> 22:02.894
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:03.391 --> 22:06.120
- It's kinda hot in here.
- Yeah.

22:06.710 --> 22:08.917
Listen, I need to talk to you.

22:10.408 --> 22:11.533
Here, people.

22:11.544 --> 22:13.711
W-T-F?

22:20.862 --> 22:22.686
What the hell is this?

22:24.221 --> 22:26.413
Did you do this?

22:26.976 --> 22:28.835
- No.
- Who's the lucky dude?

22:28.846 --> 22:31.171
- I have no idea.
- You guys should switch.

22:31.181 --> 22:34.140
Chilean peonies
are your favorite, right?

22:34.150 --> 22:36.677
- How did you know?
- I did my due diligence.

22:36.687 --> 22:39.580
I called in a few favors from
the old South American Rolodex,

22:39.590 --> 22:42.648
and, uh, voilà.

22:42.658 --> 22:44.751
Excuse us. Please.

22:45.603 --> 22:48.955
- These are for you.
- Unbelievable.

22:48.965 --> 22:52.993
And, uh, this is what
$400,000 looks like.

22:53.003 --> 22:55.628
It's the money I could've won.

22:55.638 --> 22:57.463
The money I never would've taken.

22:57.473 --> 22:58.865
Screw this.

22:58.875 --> 23:02.334
You spent $400,000 on me?

23:02.344 --> 23:04.670
- On flowers?
- No, no.

23:04.680 --> 23:09.275
Uh, well, maybe $100,000.

23:09.285 --> 23:11.944
It was another $100,000
to Planned Parenthood,

23:11.954 --> 23:15.400
and then another couple hundred
to Girls Who Code.

23:16.292 --> 23:17.580
Look, Serena.

23:18.527 --> 23:22.621
I need you to know
that that bet, the money,

23:22.631 --> 23:25.224
none of it means anything
compared to you.

23:25.234 --> 23:29.361
I haven't got to where I am
today without taking risks.

23:29.371 --> 23:31.730
I can bet every single penny that I have

23:31.740 --> 23:34.299
that the same could be said of you.

23:34.309 --> 23:38.202
So I'm asking you, please, take a risk.

23:38.212 --> 23:39.479
On me.

23:44.986 --> 23:46.697
Jasper, this is, um...

23:47.388 --> 23:49.121
this is amazing.

23:52.660 --> 23:54.033
I'll think about it.

23:56.030 --> 23:58.323
What? What?

23:58.333 --> 24:00.858
$400,000, and she'll think about it?

24:00.868 --> 24:03.428
No. No. He's a wifey,
for crying out loud.

24:03.438 --> 24:05.729
Somebody go defrost that ice princess

24:05.739 --> 24:07.201
before the elimination ceremony!

24:07.212 --> 24:10.200
Jay, at least get her back out
here for better reaction shots

24:10.210 --> 24:12.202
if you have to put audio on her back!

24:12.212 --> 24:13.737
Go, go! Ugh! JAY: Okay, all right.

24:13.747 --> 24:16.882
You tried, man. That's all you can do.

24:24.283 --> 24:26.509
You need professional care, sir.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.574
- It's a 30-day program.
- I just need Rachel to come home.

24:29.585 --> 24:31.664
Do you really want to put that
all on your daughter?

24:31.675 --> 24:33.537
She can handle it.
She's good at what she does.

24:33.548 --> 24:35.292
Yeah, and that might be the problem.

24:35.302 --> 24:38.528
Especially with a boss
as demanding as Quinn.

24:38.538 --> 24:40.964
What do you mean? What is Quinn doing?
Is she hurting Rachel?

24:40.975 --> 24:44.467
- I heard the way she was talking...
- No, no, no. It's just...

24:44.477 --> 24:46.536
From what I've learned,

24:46.546 --> 24:48.538
this place is more
than anyone can handle.

24:48.548 --> 24:50.381
Okay, what are you not telling me?

24:53.785 --> 24:55.378
Whoo!

24:55.388 --> 24:56.812
<i>Chill with my roommate, mostly.</i>

24:56.822 --> 24:58.747
<i>Guy. He's great. The cooker dude.</i>

24:58.757 --> 25:00.883
<i>The other night we stayed up
TILL LIKE 3:00 a.m.</i>

25:00.893 --> 25:03.085
<i>It's delicious. He's my boy.</i>

25:03.095 --> 25:04.953
<i>I just want to put
these hands all over you.</i>

25:04.963 --> 25:07.823
<i>- I can't stop thinking about you.
- This is crazy.</i>

25:07.833 --> 25:09.492
<i>You should know how I feel about you.</i>

25:09.502 --> 25:11.760
<i>We're on the same team.
I dream about you.</i>

25:11.770 --> 25:13.436
<i>Yeah!</i>

25:17.008 --> 25:19.767
What the hell did you guys do?
We're not gay!

25:19.778 --> 25:22.004
We're just following the story.

25:22.014 --> 25:23.839
That's not the story!

25:23.849 --> 25:26.107
You guys put that together.
That's... That's slander!

25:26.117 --> 25:27.409
You can't air that!

25:27.419 --> 25:28.910
Oh, of course we can't.

25:28.920 --> 25:31.112
I mean, at least not
without your permission.

25:31.122 --> 25:34.416
- Which you'll never get!
- Oh, that's too bad.

25:34.426 --> 25:36.317
'Cause the truth is,

25:36.327 --> 25:38.186
tonight's probably
the end of the line for you.

25:38.196 --> 25:40.522
Things are looking
a little dry with Serena.

25:40.532 --> 25:42.957
- You're going home without a fiancée.
- Yeah.

25:42.967 --> 25:45.192
And, you know, without even making,

25:45.202 --> 25:48.963
like, a real name for yourself
or your culinary dreams.

25:48.973 --> 25:51.599
Such a shame,
'cause it's such a good story.

25:51.609 --> 25:54.435
I mean, after years of wondering
why you're still single,

25:54.445 --> 25:56.804
you come on "Everlasting"
only to discover

25:56.814 --> 25:59.339
the love you've been
looking for in a man.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.208
Oh, the eyeballs we'd get.

26:01.218 --> 26:04.311
Oh, on the show, and on you!

26:04.321 --> 26:06.613
What are you suggesting?

26:06.623 --> 26:09.383
Uh, you know, part of me
has always wanted

26:09.393 --> 26:12.352
to get into the restaurant
business, right?

26:12.362 --> 26:15.189
- How 'bout you, Chet?
- Well, you know that about me.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.624
I've just been looking
for the right chef to invest in.

26:17.634 --> 26:21.002
Yeah, and all you have to do
is lean into the narrative.

26:23.139 --> 26:24.397
It's complicated.

26:24.407 --> 26:26.165
Rachel's history with this place...

26:26.175 --> 26:27.867
I can't give you specifics,

26:27.877 --> 26:31.738
but Quinn hired me specifically
to safeguard Rachel

26:31.748 --> 26:33.573
after what happened last year.

26:33.583 --> 26:35.508
Why? What happened?

26:35.518 --> 26:38.010
Well, as you know,
Rachel was hospitalized.

26:38.020 --> 26:41.247
It was a real breakdown. And I-I'm
just saying, having you here

26:41.257 --> 26:43.749
may be more than Rachel's
equipped to handle.

26:44.673 --> 26:46.419
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

26:46.429 --> 26:47.967
Nothing. I'm just talking to your dad.

26:47.978 --> 26:50.089
- About what?
- Hon, I had no idea

26:50.099 --> 26:51.490
you were under so much stress.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.191
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

26:53.201 --> 26:55.160
Dad, whatever he told you, it's a lie.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.595
Rach, we have to do something.

26:56.605 --> 26:58.230
Seriously, what is this?!

26:58.240 --> 27:01.559
Rachel, I was just explaining
to your dad

27:01.570 --> 27:03.197
how challenging things are for you here.

27:03.208 --> 27:04.697
Look, I don't want
to be a burden, right?

27:04.708 --> 27:06.774
I just want to be a dad.
That's all I ever wanted.

27:06.785 --> 27:08.818
- You've completely crossed the line.
- I didn't.

27:08.829 --> 27:10.289
Yes, you did. You went behind my back

27:10.300 --> 27:12.377
when you knew I'd be gone
and put ideas in his head,

27:12.387 --> 27:14.746
when I explicitly told you
that he was okay.

27:14.756 --> 27:16.782
He's not okay!

27:16.793 --> 27:19.184
He's not well, Rachel.
He needs to be in a facility!

27:19.194 --> 27:21.286
Stop telling me what to do.

27:21.296 --> 27:22.995
Dad?

27:26.500 --> 27:28.392
You're gonna be a tabloid hero.

27:28.402 --> 27:31.891
And with all that press and our support,

27:31.902 --> 27:34.172
you could open a restaurant anywhere...

27:34.183 --> 27:36.108
Weho, Chelsea...

27:39.250 --> 27:41.639
Vegas. On the strip.

27:41.649 --> 27:43.954
None of this downtown resurgence crap.

27:44.585 --> 27:47.077
- And I wanna be bi.
- Okay.

27:47.087 --> 27:48.612
No problem.

27:48.622 --> 27:50.414
Sexuality is so fluid these days.

27:50.425 --> 27:52.058
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.419
Quinn!
Where the hell is Quinn King?!

27:56.429 --> 27:57.888
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

27:57.898 --> 27:59.956
Where the hell is she?!

27:59.966 --> 28:04.146
All you people with your... your
cameras and your walkie talkies,

28:04.157 --> 28:06.763
and you're talking in her ear,
trying to control her! I...

28:06.773 --> 28:08.965
- I'm gonna need to get Rachel.
- Hey! I heard that.

28:08.975 --> 28:10.934
What the hell
is he talking about?

28:10.944 --> 28:12.602
I don't have voices in my ear.

28:12.612 --> 28:14.763
I had Olive in my ear
for a very long time,

28:14.774 --> 28:17.173
but I don't... have her
in my ear anymore.

28:17.183 --> 28:18.403
Mr. Goldberg, I don't think...

28:18.414 --> 28:21.744
You stay right where you are. Don't
you come near me. I see you.

28:22.946 --> 28:24.947
What are you doing to her?

28:25.844 --> 28:27.283
You're hurting her, you know that?

28:27.293 --> 28:29.018
And you have to stop it.

28:29.028 --> 28:32.021
I will not let you
poison my little girl.

28:32.031 --> 28:34.643
She has more... more guts
and more talent

28:34.654 --> 28:36.625
than any of you,
and you are ruining her!

28:36.635 --> 28:38.397
Let me talk to him, all right?
I've got it. It's fine. Dad.

28:38.408 --> 28:40.373
I have to protect you.
I couldn't protect you before.

28:40.384 --> 28:42.076
Listen, I don't need protecting.
It's okay.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.659
No, sweetheart, it happened in my house.

28:43.670 --> 28:46.404
What that man did to you
was in my house.

28:46.415 --> 28:48.154
It should've been the safest
place of all for you.

28:48.165 --> 28:49.264
Come on, Dad. It's okay.

28:49.459 --> 28:50.854
- Come on. It's okay.
- Forgive me. Forgive me, sweetheart.

28:50.865 --> 28:52.974
- Come on, Dad. Come on.
- Can you forgive me?

28:52.991 --> 28:55.425
Dad, yeah, of course.
I'm okay. I got it.

28:57.889 --> 29:00.315
Seriously? Shut the hell up!

29:00.325 --> 29:02.158
Show some respect!

29:07.565 --> 29:09.991
Chet! Put it down.

29:10.001 --> 29:11.893
It's good drama. Emmy.

29:11.903 --> 29:14.654
This is real. This is Rachel.

29:15.039 --> 29:17.039
All right, guys. Show's over.

29:18.008 --> 29:19.708
Back to work!

29:28.975 --> 29:30.570
Does Olive know he's here?

29:30.580 --> 29:33.679
Yeah. I mean, like, no, not really.
Quinn, look.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.164
You don't even understand, okay?

29:35.174 --> 29:36.974
I mean, like, I had to get him
away from her.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.897
Your mom is a witch, I get it. But
your dad does not belong on set.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.912
I'm just keeping him here
until I can get him off

29:41.922 --> 29:44.715
all those drugs that she's
forced on him all those years.

29:44.725 --> 29:46.349
Like, I can do it. I did it for myself.

29:46.359 --> 29:48.385
I can help him. He just needs to detox.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.054
Okay, Rachel, you gotta take
a beat, all right?

29:51.064 --> 29:53.156
I get it, but this is beyond you.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.591
Your dad needs real help.

29:54.601 --> 29:57.160
No, I can do it, Quinn, okay? I have to!

29:57.170 --> 30:00.897
Okay, listen to me, all right?

30:02.374 --> 30:05.035
I know you think that if you fix him,

30:05.045 --> 30:07.337
you'll somehow fix yourself,

30:07.347 --> 30:09.813
but that's not how it works.

30:19.759 --> 30:22.618
Okay.

30:22.628 --> 30:24.086
What? What is that?

30:24.096 --> 30:25.855
One lousy bouquet?

30:25.865 --> 30:28.524
What happened to the rest
of peonies and... Oh, my God.

30:28.534 --> 30:30.760
What is on Graham's head?

30:30.770 --> 30:34.096
<i>They say love is blind,
but not for the lucky men</i>

30:34.106 --> 30:39.676
<i>for whom Serena will gift
these Vesper GS-1...</i>

30:40.979 --> 30:43.272
Night Vision Goggles. Wow.

30:43.282 --> 30:46.708
Star light, star bright,
first hot woman I see tonight

30:46.718 --> 30:50.312
is, oh, our Northern Star, Serena!

30:50.322 --> 30:52.447
Thank you, Graham.

30:52.457 --> 30:56.358
<i>The Vesper GS-1: See the Love.</i>

30:58.462 --> 31:02.122
Well, it's been another...
interesting evening.

31:02.133 --> 31:03.792
- And...
- Wait!

31:03.802 --> 31:06.494
I'm sorry, Serena, but before
this goes any further,

31:06.504 --> 31:08.829
I have something to say.
I'm cutting myself.

31:08.839 --> 31:10.998
- Hmm.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

31:11.008 --> 31:13.667
<i>This is hard for me to talk about...</i>

31:13.677 --> 31:16.070
but there's actually
someone here I care for

31:16.080 --> 31:17.905
who's not Serena.

31:17.915 --> 31:19.907
You're beautiful and amazing,

31:19.917 --> 31:22.653
but this is all a lie.

31:22.664 --> 31:25.371
<i>Being here, I realized</i>

31:25.382 --> 31:27.051
the truth about myself.

31:27.062 --> 31:29.963
And I found a different kind of love.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.255
I'm off to Sin City, folks!

31:33.265 --> 31:35.823
I'm opening a new restaurant in Vegas.

31:35.833 --> 31:38.525
On the strip. Coming 2019.

31:38.535 --> 31:42.137
See? I told you guys he was here
for all the wrong reasons.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.798
Oh, my God. Did you see that?!

31:45.808 --> 31:48.968
- What, is he gay now or something?
- Ooh, that!

31:48.978 --> 31:51.871
The squeeze that launched
a thousand Tweets!

31:51.881 --> 31:55.371
Hmm. Well, can't wait for
Twitter to get a hold of that.

31:55.852 --> 31:58.064
<i>Well. That was unexpected.</i>

31:58.074 --> 32:01.676
But I still do need to cut
one more of you tonight.

32:04.294 --> 32:07.087
Warren, I get that you think
that I'm the one for you,

32:07.097 --> 32:09.289
but I think you should go find the...

32:09.299 --> 32:12.359
the person that
you're supposed to be with

32:12.369 --> 32:13.593
<i>as soon as you can.</i>

32:13.603 --> 32:15.895
Oh. Bye-bye, Brokeback.

32:15.905 --> 32:17.764
That was a bonus, right?

32:17.774 --> 32:19.599
Yeah. It's the perfect ending.

32:19.609 --> 32:21.568
<i> Okay, yeah. That's a cut.</i>

32:21.578 --> 32:23.811
<i>Can we get somebody in here to
blow out these candles?</i>

32:29.051 --> 32:30.742
You can't do this.

32:30.753 --> 32:34.581
- I can't do what?
- I didn't screw Guy...

32:34.591 --> 32:36.415
not him or... or any other dude, okay?

32:36.425 --> 32:38.785
How many times do I
have to tell you? I'm not gay!

32:38.795 --> 32:42.989
Mm, except now, there's no way
you can say that on TV

32:42.999 --> 32:44.824
without sounding like an asshole.

32:44.834 --> 32:47.960
So, what am I supposed to do?
This is my life!

32:47.970 --> 32:51.340
I make TV, Warren.
Life's not my problem.

32:55.777 --> 32:57.570
Well, maybe it should be.

32:57.580 --> 33:01.394
'Cause getting mercy slammed
by a contestant half your age...

33:02.251 --> 33:04.217
that's just sad.

33:10.166 --> 33:11.394
Hey, Rachel.

33:13.095 --> 33:14.519
Hey, um...

33:14.529 --> 33:18.289
I'm, uh... really sorry.

33:18.299 --> 33:19.657
For what?

33:19.667 --> 33:23.194
I was callous and insensitive before.

33:23.204 --> 33:26.097
I didn't realize you were
dealing with so much.

33:26.107 --> 33:28.699
- It's, like, not your problem.
- Is there anything I can do?

33:28.709 --> 33:31.310
No, it's fine. Have a good night.

33:46.688 --> 33:48.653
- Rachel...
- I know.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.162
Can we have a second?

33:55.402 --> 33:57.101
Daddy?

34:18.489 --> 34:20.079
Hey, Quinnie.

34:21.822 --> 34:23.755
Is Rachel okay?

34:25.293 --> 34:27.610
She is always okay.

34:28.295 --> 34:30.696
She's tough. She's a fighter.

34:31.895 --> 34:34.629
Like you.

34:35.936 --> 34:37.436
Listen.

34:37.446 --> 34:40.973
Uh... I really do appreciate

34:40.983 --> 34:43.918
you taking this Emmy thing seriously.

34:43.928 --> 34:45.763
I know it sound crazy.

34:45.773 --> 34:50.174
It's just I think this is my one
shot at leaving a legacy to my son,

34:50.184 --> 34:52.107
who I'll probably never see again.

34:52.118 --> 34:55.344
Yes, you will.

34:55.355 --> 34:57.440
You fight for everything.

34:57.451 --> 34:59.648
You even came at me the other night.

34:59.659 --> 35:02.686
- Which got me nowhere...
- But you tried.

35:02.696 --> 35:06.189
So, why are you not trying for this?

35:06.199 --> 35:09.025
If you want to see your son,
fight for him!

35:09.035 --> 35:11.460
You can win an Emmy,
you can see your son,

35:11.470 --> 35:13.362
you can do whatever the hell you want.

35:13.372 --> 35:16.040
But you have to fight.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.268
Yeah.

35:20.309 --> 35:23.207
Hey, you want these filters
in the cart or on the truck?

35:24.503 --> 35:25.690
Jeremy?

35:25.701 --> 35:28.635
What? Um, yeah. Thanks.

35:32.057 --> 35:33.590
You should go talk to her.

35:35.298 --> 35:37.931
I'm serious. She needs
someone right now.

35:40.204 --> 35:41.269
Thank you.

35:56.381 --> 35:59.516
- It's too much, Rach.
- No, it's fine, Dad, really.

35:59.941 --> 36:01.365
It's what you need.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.360
Rach?

36:17.863 --> 36:19.656
You in there?

36:24.108 --> 36:25.832
Rach?

36:25.842 --> 36:28.110
Jeremy? What are you doing?

36:29.990 --> 36:31.189
What are you doing?

36:31.199 --> 36:33.199
I'm checking on Rachel.

36:36.563 --> 36:38.029
Me, too.

36:39.974 --> 36:41.195
Don't.

36:42.062 --> 36:43.996
We cannot do this again.

36:44.007 --> 36:45.740
Trust me.

36:46.129 --> 36:47.628
Step away.

36:59.154 --> 37:01.100
Why so sad?

37:01.111 --> 37:03.145
Sissy no bounce?

37:05.614 --> 37:08.048
We broke up.

37:09.585 --> 37:11.685
I feel like shit.

37:14.623 --> 37:18.525
This is what always
makes me feel better.

37:44.185 --> 37:47.979
Want to get a drink, or
you want to go home and crash?

37:47.989 --> 37:50.556
Okay, good.

38:07.674 --> 38:09.833
Hi!

38:09.843 --> 38:12.803
Oh... Oh, no. I'm sorry.
I was running a little bit late.

38:12.813 --> 38:15.772
We had a... I had to be
in the editing, uh, bay.

38:15.782 --> 38:18.108
I-I-I'm on my way, and I'm sorry.

38:18.118 --> 38:20.118
Okay. I lo... Okay, you too. Bye.

38:46.978 --> 38:49.571
- Hello?
- It's Rachel calling you back.

38:49.582 --> 38:52.875
Hey, Rachel, whatever you said
to the owners worked.

38:52.885 --> 38:54.677
They're willing to cut you a deal,

38:54.687 --> 38:57.425
but they need that 75k tomorrow.

38:57.435 --> 38:58.601
I don't have it.

38:58.611 --> 39:00.711
I beg your pardon?

39:00.728 --> 39:01.821
The money...

39:02.868 --> 39:05.517
I thought I had it,
but I don't have it anymore.

39:06.652 --> 39:08.519
It's all gone.
