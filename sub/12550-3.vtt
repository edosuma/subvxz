19:43.282 --> 19:44.049

19:45.951 --> 19:47.419
It's out of control!

19:47.486 --> 19:48.987
Wait for me!

19:51.490 --> 19:52.791
Whoa!

19:56.028 --> 19:59.064
Resynchronise
the mega-wattage!

19:59.131 --> 20:01.166
Quickly, we've got
to get out of here!

20:04.736 --> 20:06.438
You can't leave us in here!

20:06.505 --> 20:08.340
Use your sonic device,
open the door.

20:08.407 --> 20:09.708
Open the door!

20:09.775 --> 20:10.742
I'm only 12!

20:12.911 --> 20:14.012
He's my son!

20:14.746 --> 20:16.148
Please, let him live.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.217
Luke.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.452
You can't let them out!

20:21.720 --> 20:22.921
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:32.664 --> 20:34.032
It's burnt itself out.

20:34.099 --> 20:35.200
We did it!

20:35.267 --> 20:37.703
He was a child, 12 years old.

20:37.769 --> 20:38.971
It was them or us!

20:42.908 --> 20:45.444
CLYDE: Some of
the Slitheen got away.
I saw them vanish.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.879
LUKE: Their machine's
useless now.
We broke the chain.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.581
MARIA: Except there's
buildings round the world

20:49.648 --> 20:52.217
with secret rooms
and all that alien
machinery inside.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.152
Bye now, love to the Brig!

20:54.219 --> 20:55.587
Just sorted that.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.723
Some friends of mine
are going to clear it all up.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.157
-Friends from UNIT?
-Uh-huh.

20:59.224 --> 21:01.493
What's UNIT, a furniture shop?

21:01.560 --> 21:04.029
Where were you? Come here!

21:04.096 --> 21:06.632
Oh, where've you been?

21:06.698 --> 21:08.600
We just went up town,
grabbed some burgers.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.602
The power went off,
I was so worried!

21:10.669 --> 21:11.970
Now it's back on.

21:12.170 --> 21:15.674
Oh, Sally Anne, bless you
for looking after my Maria.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.043
My head was full
of terrible things
that could've happened.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.478
ALAN: Okay, where've
you really been?

21:19.544 --> 21:21.713
-What d'you mean?
-Such a useless liar.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.415
Oh, shut up, Alan.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.484
Did you see the sun?
It went blue!

21:25.550 --> 21:27.519
I mean, I've heard
of a blue moon,
that's quite romantic,

21:27.586 --> 21:28.987
but it was terrifying.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.292
I was just gonna make tea.
Are you staying?

21:34.359 --> 21:37.029
Um, don't tell me, Tuesday,

21:37.095 --> 21:38.030

21:38.096 --> 21:40.365
-As it happens.
-So predictable.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.669
Go on then, twist my arm.
Just this once,
I'll suffer your cooking.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.905
-That's brilliant!
-Oh, sweetheart.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.474
I may not be living here,
but at least I'm still
looking after you.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.176
Right, 'cause I'm so useless.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.111
Yeah, well, you are!
The sun went out
and you lost her!

21:53.178 --> 21:55.113
She was off
gallivanting with Suzie Q!

21:55.180 --> 21:57.516
Sarah Jane,
her name is Sarah Jane.

21:57.582 --> 21:59.951
Oh, whatever, Sarah Jane.

Tell you what, though.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.225
Funny things have been
happening ever since
you moved in here.

22:07.292 --> 22:08.760
I'm beginning
to get suspicious.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.430
Suspicious of what?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.298
Well, think about it, right?

22:13.365 --> 22:16.501
You move in opposite
Sarah Jane, and everyone
turns into zombies.

22:16.568 --> 22:19.337
Then you're with Sarah Jane,
and the pop factory blows up.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.973
Then you run off
with Sarah Jane,
and the sun goes out.

22:22.040 --> 22:24.876
Just ask yourself what have
those things got in common?

22:24.943 --> 22:26.912
Or rather, who have
they got in common? Eh?

22:28.346 --> 22:30.082
I don't know.

22:30.148 --> 22:32.617
Me. It's all happening to me!

22:32.684 --> 22:34.986
I just can't
move for disasters, it's...

22:35.721 --> 22:36.888
It's like I'm cursed!

22:40.726 --> 22:42.794
What's that for, sweetheart?

22:42.861 --> 22:43.895

22:44.563 --> 22:45.597
Yeah.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

22:47.265 --> 22:48.467
Here's your reward,

22:49.267 --> 22:50.969
a nice cuppa.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.872
Oh, d'you mind?
Just make sure you put that
back where it belongs.

22:54.806 --> 22:55.907
Is this from outer space?

22:56.975 --> 22:58.944
No, Venezuela.

22:59.010 --> 23:00.746
You ask too many
questions, Clyde.

23:00.812 --> 23:01.813
Too late to stop me now.

23:02.414 --> 23:03.615
I suppose.

23:03.682 --> 23:06.418
That's how I got started,
asking questions.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.320
But you never told me.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.723
How did you discover all
this stuff, aliens and things?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.792
I met this man
called the Doctor.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.894
He was an alien, too.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.763
What, like a big green thing?

23:17.829 --> 23:20.265
No, he looked
just like you and me.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.667
Except he was nothing
like you and me.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.837
He took me out into space
far away from Earth.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.706
You travelled through space?

23:27.773 --> 23:31.977
And time.
I saw planets and galaxies
and all sorts of creatures,

23:32.043 --> 23:34.012
things you would
never imagine.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.481
So where is he now,
then, this Doctor?

23:36.548 --> 23:38.850
Still out there.
Still wandering.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.853
Still wonderful.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.023
And he left me behind
with his legacy, I suppose.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.758
To help and to protect.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.961
To make a stand
and to never give up.

23:50.028 --> 23:50.896
He sounds cool.

23:51.730 --> 23:53.632
Cool? Yeah.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.501
So, are you gonna
see him again?

23:56.568 --> 23:59.538
I hope so.

23:59.604 --> 24:02.240
The thing is, Clyde,
you can't ever tell anyone
about all these things.

24:02.307 --> 24:03.508
It's got to be our secret.

24:04.242 --> 24:05.143
Can I trust you?

24:06.011 --> 24:07.846
Yeah. Promise.

to calling you Sarah Jane.

save those Slitheen.

the entire planet,
