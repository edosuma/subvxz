NARRATOR: Tonight,

00:08.289 --> 00:11.089
these patients' relationships

00:08.289 --> 00:11.089
were ruined

00:11.099 --> 00:13.210
because of their plastic

00:11.099 --> 00:13.210
surgery.

00:13.220 --> 00:16.079
After three failed surgeries,

00:13.220 --> 00:16.079
I still couldn't breathe

00:16.089 --> 00:18.070
and I've lost my love life

00:16.089 --> 00:18.070
as well.

00:18.079 --> 00:20.239
My tummy tuck

00:18.079 --> 00:20.239
didn't just destroy my stomach,

00:20.250 --> 00:22.239
it destroyed my marriage.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.239
I got silicone injections

00:24.250 --> 00:26.140
in my arms, buttocks,

00:26.149 --> 00:28.269
my nose, and my lips.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.239
My ex actually broke up

00:28.280 --> 00:31.239
with me.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.219
Well, we were actually engaged

00:31.250 --> 00:33.219
at one point.

00:33.229 --> 00:35.149
And then he left me

00:33.229 --> 00:35.149
for getting plastic surgery.

00:35.159 --> 00:37.270
- Yeah.

00:35.159 --> 00:37.270
- What? Wait, what? Wait, what?

00:37.280 --> 00:40.060
My surgeon starts cutting me

00:37.280 --> 00:40.060
more and more

00:40.070 --> 00:41.270
and then all of a sudden,

00:40.070 --> 00:41.270
you could put a fist

00:41.280 --> 00:44.140
in my stomach.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.140
And there's no belly button.

00:44.149 --> 00:47.079
That exact complication

00:44.149 --> 00:47.079
could happen to us.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.149
Scary stuff, my dear.

00:49.159 --> 00:51.189
Ah.[bleep]

00:51.200 --> 00:54.280
I can completely push

00:51.200 --> 00:54.280
my nose in.

00:54.289 --> 00:57.039
DR. NASSIF: Fire alarm.

00:54.289 --> 00:57.039
We're gonna have to extubate

00:57.049 --> 00:59.149
the patient and leave the room.

My name is Barak.

01:19.039 --> 01:21.159
I'm 45 years old

01:21.170 --> 01:24.099
and sometimes what God gives you

01:21.170 --> 01:24.099
is not enough

01:24.109 --> 01:26.069
so you have to turn

01:24.109 --> 01:26.069
to other gods,

01:26.079 --> 01:27.200
plastic surgery god.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.099
[laughs]

01:29.109 --> 01:30.280
Over the course of 13 years,

01:30.289 --> 01:32.280
I got silicone injections

01:32.289 --> 01:35.120
in my arms, to my buttocks,

01:35.129 --> 01:37.210
my nose to try

01:35.129 --> 01:37.210
to make it straight,

01:37.219 --> 01:40.219
and my lips

01:37.219 --> 01:40.219
to try to get them

01:40.229 --> 01:42.109
a little bit fuller.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.129
When I was growing up

01:42.120 --> 01:45.129
in Tel Aviv, Israel

01:45.140 --> 01:48.090
I knew that I wanna have a body

01:45.140 --> 01:48.090
of a superhero.

01:48.099 --> 01:51.000
I was kind of obsessed

01:48.099 --> 01:51.000
with size and power.

01:51.009 --> 01:53.140
I was going to the gym

01:51.009 --> 01:53.140
all the time

01:53.150 --> 01:55.270
but my arms could never get

01:53.150 --> 01:55.270
any bigger

01:55.280 --> 01:59.280
and my goal

01:55.280 --> 01:59.280
was to have arms 21 inches.

01:59.289 --> 02:02.060
Fast forward, me and my ex

02:02.069 --> 02:04.170
were in Puerto Vallarta

02:02.069 --> 02:04.170
and we see a guy

02:04.180 --> 02:08.180
and his body

02:04.180 --> 02:08.180
was crazy beautiful.

02:08.189 --> 02:11.199
And my friend turned to me

02:08.189 --> 02:11.199
and said "It's all fake.

02:11.210 --> 02:14.210
I have a friend,

02:11.210 --> 02:14.210
he's a 'doctor.'"

02:14.219 --> 02:18.009
And my first reaction

02:14.219 --> 02:18.009
is "I want his number."

02:18.020 --> 02:19.159
[laughs]

02:19.170 --> 02:21.189
My first silicone injection,

02:21.199 --> 02:25.009
he came to my friend place

02:21.199 --> 02:25.009
in Mexico City.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.229
Pumping silicone in your body

02:25.020 --> 02:28.229
feels like working out

02:28.240 --> 02:31.240
really, really, really hard

02:28.240 --> 02:31.240
because they pump it

02:31.250 --> 02:33.079
into your muscles,

02:33.090 --> 02:36.120
so you feel your muscle

02:33.090 --> 02:36.120
get tighter.

02:36.129 --> 02:39.159
And I finally reached

02:36.129 --> 02:39.159
21 inches

02:39.170 --> 02:41.129
and I have a superhero arms

02:41.139 --> 02:43.189
like I've seen in the cartoons.

02:43.199 --> 02:47.079
My ex was very against

02:43.199 --> 02:47.079
silicone injections.

02:47.090 --> 02:49.180
Actually, he broke up with me

02:49.189 --> 02:51.280
while in the process

02:49.189 --> 02:51.280
of getting my arms,

02:51.289 --> 02:54.009
but now actually,

02:51.289 --> 02:54.009
our relationship

02:54.020 --> 02:55.110
is better than ever.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.079
NIKO: Do you think the sun

02:55.120 --> 02:57.079
is gonna make

02:57.090 --> 02:58.180
the silicone in your arms melt?

02:58.189 --> 03:00.210
I don't think so. [laughs]

03:00.219 --> 03:03.189
Right now, my arms are exactly

03:00.219 --> 03:03.189
the size I want it,

03:03.199 --> 03:06.189
but unfortunately,

03:03.199 --> 03:06.189
about a year and a half ago,

03:06.199 --> 03:09.270
I start feeling some bumps

03:06.199 --> 03:09.270
that need to be removed.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.250
I have a hard silicone

03:09.280 --> 03:12.250
on the bottom part

03:12.259 --> 03:15.120
of my left bicep,

03:12.259 --> 03:15.120
and in the right side

03:15.129 --> 03:19.020
on the inner side

03:15.129 --> 03:19.020
of my bicep on my elbow.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.180
I have no clue what Dr. Dubrow

03:21.189 --> 03:23.139
and Dr. Nassif will tell me.

03:23.150 --> 03:26.240
I just hope it's a good news.

03:26.250 --> 03:30.189
Hopefully,

03:26.250 --> 03:30.189
they can help me fix it.

03:30.199 --> 03:34.030
I don't think

03:30.199 --> 03:34.030
they have ever met

03:34.039 --> 03:36.079
a patient like me,

03:36.090 --> 03:39.150
and my arms

03:36.090 --> 03:39.150
are the living proof it.

03:48.039 --> 03:50.199
I'm 49 years old

03:50.210 --> 03:52.199
and my plastic surgery

03:50.210 --> 03:52.199
in Mexico

03:52.210 --> 03:54.090
didn't just destroy my stomach,

03:54.099 --> 03:56.030
it destroyed my marriage.

03:56.039 --> 03:59.039
I have scars going across

03:56.039 --> 03:59.039
and up my stomach

03:59.050 --> 04:00.199
and no belly button.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.280
What are we looking for, Mom?

04:01.289 --> 04:04.189
I'm looking for a bed

04:01.289 --> 04:04.189
because your dad

04:04.199 --> 04:06.039
wants the bed

04:04.199 --> 04:06.039
and the divorce.

04:06.050 --> 04:09.009
My ex-husband and I

04:06.050 --> 04:09.009
led a very active lifestyle

04:09.020 --> 04:10.240
so I was always very thin.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.159
Being married,

04:10.250 --> 04:12.159
you get comfortable,

04:12.169 --> 04:16.120
and I went from wearing a small

04:12.169 --> 04:16.120
to a medium

04:16.129 --> 04:18.050
and then an extra-large.

04:18.060 --> 04:21.089
And I never really

04:18.060 --> 04:21.089
followed through

04:21.100 --> 04:23.259
with the exercise

04:21.100 --> 04:23.259
or the dieting.

04:23.269 --> 04:26.279
So, I just decided

04:23.269 --> 04:26.279
to have a tummy tuck

04:26.290 --> 04:29.250
and in my eyes,

04:26.290 --> 04:29.250
I was gonna look fabulous,

04:29.259 --> 04:32.180
but then after several months

04:29.259 --> 04:32.180
of complications

04:32.189 --> 04:35.230
and many procedures,

04:32.189 --> 04:35.230
my stomach looked deformed

04:35.240 --> 04:37.209
almost like a Frankenstein.

04:37.220 --> 04:39.269
It looked very, very ugly.

04:39.279 --> 04:43.000
My husband felt like

04:39.279 --> 04:43.000
it was my own fault

04:43.009 --> 04:44.159
for wanting this surgery.

04:44.170 --> 04:46.269
My marriage was in shambles

04:46.279 --> 04:49.120
and in January 2020,

04:49.129 --> 04:51.290
my husband left.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
It's for the best, you know,

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
and I'm hurt.

04:54.009 --> 04:56.040
Obviously there's still

04:54.009 --> 04:56.040
a lot of emotion,

04:56.050 --> 04:58.199
17 years that are gone.

05:00.209 --> 05:03.160
I was in a really dark place

05:00.209 --> 05:03.160
right after he left.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.110
I begged him to come back.

05:05.120 --> 05:08.019
Our vows were supposed to be

05:05.120 --> 05:08.019
for better or for worse,

05:08.029 --> 05:09.199
in sickness and in health.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.259
It wasn't expected from him.

05:11.269 --> 05:15.230
I was hurt that he didn't stick

05:11.269 --> 05:15.230
by those vows.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.060
I know. Me, too.

05:17.069 --> 05:19.259
So you getting this surgery,

05:17.069 --> 05:19.259
it's a new slate for you.

05:19.269 --> 05:23.060
It is, and I know

05:19.269 --> 05:23.060
that I can overcome this.

05:23.069 --> 05:24.220
I'm strong.

05:24.230 --> 05:26.180
That's why my sisters and I

05:24.230 --> 05:26.180
are so strong

05:26.189 --> 05:28.199
- because we have a strong mom.

05:26.189 --> 05:28.199
- Thank you, baby.

05:28.209 --> 05:30.100
Finally, I'm in a place

05:28.209 --> 05:30.100
where

05:30.110 --> 05:31.230
I don't even want him

05:30.110 --> 05:31.230
to come back.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.100
Like, I'm completely done

05:31.240 --> 05:34.100
with him.

05:34.110 --> 05:36.199
I'm ready to move on

05:34.110 --> 05:36.199
with my life.

05:36.209 --> 05:39.180
I'm just ready

05:36.209 --> 05:39.180
for Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif

05:39.189 --> 05:41.120
to give me this opportunity.

05:41.129 --> 05:43.269
I need something positive

05:41.129 --> 05:43.269
in my life.

05:44.290 --> 05:47.269
[music]

05:50.050 --> 05:52.220
So, I'm on the phone

05:50.050 --> 05:52.220
with a patient

05:52.230 --> 05:54.240
the other night. She said,

05:52.230 --> 05:54.240
"I'm really nauseous."

05:54.250 --> 05:57.040
And I said, "Okay,

05:54.250 --> 05:57.040
let me call in a prescription

05:57.050 --> 05:58.290
for an anti-nausea medication."

05:59.000 --> 06:00.189
She goes "I don't think

05:59.000 --> 06:00.189
I'll be able to keep it down."

06:00.199 --> 06:01.209
I go, "Well, I'll get you

06:00.199 --> 06:01.209
a suppository."

06:01.220 --> 06:03.160
- Suppository.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.160
- And she goes,

06:03.170 --> 06:05.069
"What do I do with that?"

06:03.170 --> 06:05.069
I go,

06:05.079 --> 06:07.149
"You take the suppository

06:07.160 --> 06:09.240
and you put it up your--"

06:09.250 --> 06:14.009
- Rectum, butt.

06:09.250 --> 06:14.009
- "Butt--" I go, "butt...hole."

06:14.019 --> 06:16.120
- You said "butthole"?

06:14.019 --> 06:16.120
- I said "butthole." I went,

06:16.129 --> 06:18.050
"I just said 'butthole.'"

06:16.129 --> 06:18.050
[laughs]

06:18.060 --> 06:21.139
Paging Dr. Butthole.

06:18.060 --> 06:21.139
Come in, Dr. Butthole.

06:21.149 --> 06:23.029
Back door. Back door.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.189
- DR. NASSIF: Yeah, I think--

06:23.040 --> 06:24.189
- Not front door, back door.

06:24.199 --> 06:27.000
I think that wouldn't go over

06:24.199 --> 06:27.000
well either.

06:27.009 --> 06:29.000
Put it in your back door.

06:29.009 --> 06:30.199
All right. I'm gonna show you

06:29.009 --> 06:30.199
a picture,

06:30.209 --> 06:32.220
you tell me what went wrong

06:30.209 --> 06:32.220
with this patient.

06:32.230 --> 06:34.220
- DR. NASSIF: Okay.

06:32.230 --> 06:34.220
- DR. DUBROW: Oh, geez.

06:34.230 --> 06:35.250
Is that a skin graft?

06:35.259 --> 06:37.159
DR. DUBROW: That's a skin graft.

06:37.170 --> 06:39.069
- DR. NASSIF: Was it tummy tuck?

06:37.170 --> 06:39.069
- DR. DUBROW: Yup.

06:39.079 --> 06:41.189
DR. NASSIF: That then ended up

06:39.079 --> 06:41.189
having a wound breakdown?

06:41.199 --> 06:45.149
Yup. Why such

06:41.199 --> 06:45.149
an extensive tissue loss

06:45.159 --> 06:48.139
and why is the belly button

06:45.159 --> 06:48.139
gone? Weird.

06:48.149 --> 06:50.079
So the patient is Maritza.

06:50.090 --> 06:51.209
Can you please send in Maritza?

06:53.100 --> 06:54.259
- DR. DUBROW: Maritza.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.259
- Hello.

06:54.269 --> 06:56.209
- Maritza. Nice to meet you.

06:54.269 --> 06:56.209
- Maritza.

06:56.220 --> 06:58.019
- Aly.

06:58.029 --> 06:59.090
Her daughter.

06:58.029 --> 06:59.090
Hi, nice to meet you.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.060
- Nice to meet you.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.060
- Hi.

07:01.069 --> 07:03.170
So, we've seen your pictures

07:03.180 --> 07:06.259
and that was a very extensive

07:03.180 --> 07:06.259
complication

07:06.269 --> 07:08.170
- you suffered.

07:06.269 --> 07:08.170
- Correct.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.230
All right.

07:08.180 --> 07:10.230
So how did that happen?

07:10.240 --> 07:12.259
- Take us back.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.259
- Okay. So,

07:12.269 --> 07:14.199
- I wasn't happy with my body.

07:12.269 --> 07:14.199
- Okay.

07:14.209 --> 07:16.050
And I had

07:14.209 --> 07:16.050
a couple of girlfriends

07:16.060 --> 07:18.240
that had recently

07:16.060 --> 07:18.240
had surgery in Mexico.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.290
- Okay.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.290
- And so I wanted a tummy tuck

07:21.000 --> 07:24.170
and he did lipo here,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.170
the lower part of my stomach.

07:24.180 --> 07:27.240
So the only place

07:24.180 --> 07:27.240
that was liposuctioned

07:27.250 --> 07:30.050
was the lower abdomen?

07:30.060 --> 07:31.259
- Yes.

07:30.060 --> 07:31.259
- Hmm.

07:31.269 --> 07:34.149
Unfortunately,

07:31.269 --> 07:34.149
Maritza's surgeon committed

07:34.159 --> 07:37.060
the classic eff-up.

07:37.069 --> 07:40.090
In general,

07:37.069 --> 07:40.090
you shouldn't liposuction

07:40.100 --> 07:44.220
the lower abdominal area

07:40.100 --> 07:44.220
before tummy tuck surgery

07:44.230 --> 07:47.230
because once you do that,

07:44.230 --> 07:47.230
then you're killing

07:47.240 --> 07:50.019
the primary blood supply

07:47.240 --> 07:50.019
that will allow

07:50.029 --> 07:52.000
- the tummy tuck to heal.

07:50.029 --> 07:52.000
- On day seven

07:52.009 --> 07:54.209
I noticed my skin,

07:52.009 --> 07:54.209
it was starting to turn black.

07:54.220 --> 07:57.019
So the next morning,

07:54.220 --> 07:57.019
I drove to see

07:57.029 --> 07:59.279
the original surgeon in Mexico

07:57.029 --> 07:59.279
and he explained to me

07:59.290 --> 08:03.230
that I had necrosis,

07:59.290 --> 08:03.230
and cut off all the dead skin.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.170
I go back three times

08:03.240 --> 08:06.170
and he starts cutting me

08:06.180 --> 08:08.110
more and more

08:06.180 --> 08:08.110
and then all of a sudden

08:08.120 --> 08:10.139
my hole was, like, this big.

08:10.149 --> 08:12.079
You could put a fist

08:10.149 --> 08:12.079
in my stomach.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.230
- Oh, boy.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.230
- You know.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.279
The fourth time I go in,

08:13.240 --> 08:16.279
I'm hospitalized

08:16.290 --> 08:19.110
and then he cut

08:16.290 --> 08:19.110
a piece of like,

08:19.120 --> 08:21.029
my torso over here.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.029
- Okay, he did a skin graft.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.029
- Yes.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.199
And so how long ago

08:23.040 --> 08:26.199
was the skin graft placed?

08:26.209 --> 08:28.209
- MARITZA: April of 2019.

08:26.209 --> 08:28.209
- Okay. So,

08:28.220 --> 08:30.240
we're more than a year out

08:28.220 --> 08:30.240
for the skin graft.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.029
- Correct.

08:30.250 --> 08:32.029
- From the wound being closed.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.289
- MARITZA: Correct.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.289
- That's good. So,

08:34.000 --> 08:35.220
do you think

08:34.000 --> 08:35.220
this is a challenging problem?

08:35.230 --> 08:37.070
I think it might be challenging

08:37.080 --> 08:39.200
but I'm just trying

08:37.080 --> 08:39.200
to get rid of the scar.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.179
- DR. DUBROW: The skin graft.

08:39.210 --> 08:41.179
- Correct.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.049
And there's no belly button.

08:43.059 --> 08:44.169
DR. DUBROW: Well,

08:43.059 --> 08:44.169
why wouldn't he make an incision

08:44.179 --> 08:46.039
- and just bring it out?

08:44.179 --> 08:46.039
- I don't know.

08:46.049 --> 08:48.190
So he told my husband

08:46.049 --> 08:48.190
that when he opened me up,

08:48.200 --> 08:51.289
my fat was four

08:48.200 --> 08:51.289
to five inches thick.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.019
That's why he couldn't bring

08:52.000 --> 08:54.019
the belly button.

08:54.029 --> 08:56.129
Oh, he couldn't bring out

08:54.029 --> 08:56.129
the stalk that far?

08:56.139 --> 08:57.240
He said it was inside the skin.

08:57.250 --> 08:59.190
- The belly button's inside?

08:57.250 --> 08:59.190
- Yes.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.220
When I hear that kind of story,

09:01.230 --> 09:04.080
it makes me think

09:01.230 --> 09:04.080
the surgeon cut it out

09:04.090 --> 09:07.120
and didn't realize it

09:04.090 --> 09:07.120
and he's making excuses.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.129
But by operating on Maritza,

09:09.139 --> 09:11.259
I hope there's a belly button

09:09.139 --> 09:11.259
there available

09:11.269 --> 09:14.200
under the skin

09:11.269 --> 09:14.200
because creating a belly button

09:14.210 --> 09:17.080
is one of the most

09:14.210 --> 09:17.080
difficult things to do

09:17.090 --> 09:18.159
in all of plastic surgery.

09:18.169 --> 09:20.129
Is there a belly button inside?

09:20.139 --> 09:21.200
He says there is.

09:21.210 --> 09:23.210
So, the plot thickens.

09:25.259 --> 09:29.129
Bringing this vertical scar

09:25.259 --> 09:29.129
and removing above it,

09:29.139 --> 09:32.039
it's possible if you're willing

09:29.139 --> 09:32.039
to walk around like this.

09:32.049 --> 09:35.039
- For how long?

09:32.049 --> 09:35.039
- For the rest of your life.

09:35.049 --> 09:37.279
After two weeks,

09:35.049 --> 09:37.279
he had me sit in a shower.

09:37.289 --> 09:39.240
I would blow it out gently.

09:39.250 --> 09:42.139
It was black stuff

09:39.250 --> 09:42.139
just coming out of my nose.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.240
It was bad.

09:47.029 --> 09:48.289
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

09:50.269 --> 09:53.100
So I'm trying to wrap

09:50.269 --> 09:53.100
my brain around

09:53.110 --> 09:55.029
what exactly happened to you.

09:55.039 --> 09:57.149
Why didn't the surgeon

09:55.039 --> 09:57.149
bring the belly button out?

09:57.159 --> 09:58.279
- I don't know.

09:57.159 --> 09:58.279
- It's not a thing.

09:58.289 --> 10:00.190
- It's not.

09:58.289 --> 10:00.190
- That doesn't make any sense.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.100
That's BS.

10:02.110 --> 10:03.240
So it's in there

10:02.110 --> 10:03.240
flopping around?

10:03.250 --> 10:05.250
Well, I hope so.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.250
The question is,

10:05.259 --> 10:09.000
did something inadvertently

10:05.259 --> 10:09.000
happen to it?

10:09.009 --> 10:11.059
- That's what I think happened.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.059
- Is it gone?

10:11.070 --> 10:12.269
Hearing this

10:11.070 --> 10:12.269
from Dr. Dubrow,

10:12.279 --> 10:15.000
obviously I'm surprised.

10:15.009 --> 10:16.210
Keeping my fingers crossed

10:16.220 --> 10:18.100
that my belly button

10:16.220 --> 10:18.100
is still there.

10:18.110 --> 10:21.029
Okay. So you have

10:18.110 --> 10:21.029
this skin graft right here

10:21.039 --> 10:22.279
that they used to close

10:21.039 --> 10:22.279
the wound.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.230
Sit down for a second.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.230
I'm not sure

10:24.240 --> 10:27.120
why this scar

10:24.240 --> 10:27.120
goes all the way up here.

10:27.129 --> 10:28.230
I guess

10:27.129 --> 10:28.230
because all the skin died

10:28.240 --> 10:30.100
they had to bring it together.

10:30.110 --> 10:34.029
So here's the thing--

10:30.110 --> 10:34.029
bringing this vertical scar

10:34.039 --> 10:37.269
all the way down here

10:34.039 --> 10:37.269
and removing above it,

10:37.279 --> 10:40.230
it's possible if you're willing

10:37.279 --> 10:40.230
to walk around like this.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.070
- For how long?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.070
- For the rest of your life.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.289
- Oh, no.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.289
- Or we can have a little bit

10:45.000 --> 10:48.080
of a higher horizontal scar

10:45.000 --> 10:48.080
and maybe remove

10:48.090 --> 10:50.230
the entire vertical scar

10:48.090 --> 10:50.230
so that you can have

10:50.240 --> 10:54.080
a scarless-looking abdomen

10:50.240 --> 10:54.080
in a higher bikini.

10:54.090 --> 10:57.080
So something obviously

10:54.090 --> 10:57.080
a little bit higher than this?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.289
- A little bit higher.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.289
- MARITZA: Okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.009
I want you to bring me

10:59.000 --> 11:01.009
a bikini

11:01.019 --> 11:04.009
and we're going to mark

11:01.019 --> 11:04.009
the top of the bikini

11:04.019 --> 11:06.259
in pre-op.

11:06.269 --> 11:09.110
And if you don't have

11:06.269 --> 11:09.110
a belly button in there,

11:09.120 --> 11:11.190
got to try to make you one

11:09.120 --> 11:11.190
out of some scar,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.059
not easy to do.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.009
This is complicated,

11:13.070 --> 11:16.009
fixing this.

11:16.019 --> 11:18.269
That exact complication

11:16.019 --> 11:18.269
that happened to you

11:18.279 --> 11:21.000
could happen to us.

11:21.009 --> 11:25.029
Dying, infection,

11:21.009 --> 11:25.029
the whole thing.

11:25.039 --> 11:28.029
It's because now I have

11:25.039 --> 11:28.029
beaten-up, damaged tissue.

11:28.039 --> 11:30.100
I have a special consent form

11:30.110 --> 11:32.250
that I have patients

11:30.110 --> 11:32.250
in your category sign

11:32.259 --> 11:36.210
called "high-risk consent,"

11:36.220 --> 11:40.110
which says besides

11:36.220 --> 11:40.110
all of those scary forms

11:40.120 --> 11:42.000
you just signed,

11:42.009 --> 11:44.240
oh, this is a little different.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.049
DR. NASSIF:

11:44.250 --> 11:46.049
Now, what do you think?

11:46.059 --> 11:47.269
I'm just nervous

11:46.059 --> 11:47.269
now that you're saying

11:47.279 --> 11:49.240
it's a high-risk surgery.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.110
Scary stuff, my dear.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.200
It scares me

11:52.120 --> 11:54.200
that I may go through this

11:54.210 --> 11:56.039
all over again,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.250
but there's a risk

11:56.049 --> 11:58.250
in any surgery.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.250
So, it's just having trust

11:58.259 --> 12:02.250
in your doctor

12:02.259 --> 12:06.009
and I have lots of faith

12:02.259 --> 12:06.009
in Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif.

12:06.019 --> 12:10.120
I'm willing to risk

12:06.019 --> 12:10.120
those complications

12:10.129 --> 12:12.210
to be somewhat normal again.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.139
I am so ready.

12:12.220 --> 12:14.139
It's almost like hitting

12:14.149 --> 12:18.039
a reset button

12:14.149 --> 12:18.039
and starting this new chapter

12:18.049 --> 12:20.110
in my life fresh.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.149
DR. DUBROW:

12:20.120 --> 12:22.149
So bring me a bathing suit.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.080
- Yes.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.080
- High as possible.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.210
Just like the '70s, you know.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.210
Remember those?

12:26.220 --> 12:28.039
Not the kind you wear

12:26.220 --> 12:28.039
on the beach.

12:28.049 --> 12:29.220
Not the kind he wears, no, no.

12:28.049 --> 12:29.220
No, it's like,

12:29.230 --> 12:31.100
"Oh, oh, oh."

12:33.110 --> 12:36.080
[music]

12:41.240 --> 12:44.029
Good job, guys. Whoo.

12:44.039 --> 12:46.029
Whoo. I feel like

12:44.039 --> 12:46.029
if I could breathe out

12:46.039 --> 12:48.029
of my nose and my mouth,

12:46.039 --> 12:48.029
maybe I could...

12:48.039 --> 12:50.149
catch my breath

12:48.039 --> 12:50.149
a little better.

12:50.159 --> 12:53.019
My name is Jessica.

12:50.159 --> 12:53.019
I am from Durango, Colorado

12:53.029 --> 12:55.000
and I love the mountains,

12:55.009 --> 12:56.220
but I don't want one

12:55.009 --> 12:56.220
on my nose.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.230
[laughs]

12:58.240 --> 13:00.049
I never had an issue

13:00.059 --> 13:01.250
how my nose

13:00.059 --> 13:01.250
looked cosmetically.

13:01.259 --> 13:03.159
It was more

13:01.259 --> 13:03.159
not being able to breathe

13:03.169 --> 13:05.080
and I've had three procedures

13:05.090 --> 13:07.269
and my issues got worse.

13:05.090 --> 13:07.269
Now I'm to the point

13:07.279 --> 13:09.279
where I have

13:07.279 --> 13:09.279
this cosmetic issue

13:09.289 --> 13:11.120
that I've never had.

13:11.129 --> 13:12.230
So, it was like a double whammy.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.120
Look at this.

13:14.129 --> 13:16.110
I can completely push

13:14.129 --> 13:16.110
my nose in.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.049
See, I've never even

13:16.120 --> 13:18.049
noticed that.

13:18.059 --> 13:20.129
I know. This is awful being--

13:18.059 --> 13:20.129
I wanna come out here

13:20.139 --> 13:22.159
and work out with you

13:20.139 --> 13:22.159
and, like, not have to...

13:22.169 --> 13:24.149
feel like I'm dying.

13:24.159 --> 13:26.250
If I try to breathe in this way,

13:26.259 --> 13:29.019
there's no--

13:26.259 --> 13:29.019
there's no air coming in.

13:29.029 --> 13:31.019
Being in Colorado,

13:29.029 --> 13:31.019
I wanna be outside.

13:31.029 --> 13:33.169
Like, it's my life.

13:31.029 --> 13:33.169
It's my dream

13:33.179 --> 13:35.120
to hike a bunch of fourteeners.

13:35.129 --> 13:38.289
Fourteener is 14,000 feet

13:35.129 --> 13:38.289
in elevation.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.039
You need all the oxygen

13:39.000 --> 13:41.039
you can get

13:41.049 --> 13:43.000
because of the quick elevation

13:41.049 --> 13:43.000
change.

13:43.009 --> 13:44.269
You know, they're all

13:43.009 --> 13:44.269
on my bucket list

13:44.279 --> 13:47.259
and I can't hike

13:44.279 --> 13:47.259
a fourteener with this nose.

13:47.269 --> 13:50.139
Now we're, what?

13:47.269 --> 13:50.139
Two years after my last surgery.

13:50.149 --> 13:53.019
I'm 33 now. I really feel

13:50.149 --> 13:53.019
like I'm in a good place

13:53.029 --> 13:56.059
to, like, gain some trust back

13:53.029 --> 13:56.059
from a doctor, you know,

13:56.070 --> 13:58.230
and so that's what I'm hoping

13:56.070 --> 13:58.230
this consultation

13:58.240 --> 14:00.129
with Dr. Nassif will bring.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.039
How many times do you see

14:02.120 --> 14:06.039
a functional procedure

14:06.049 --> 14:08.139
cause a cosmetic problem?

14:08.149 --> 14:09.269
- Not very often.

14:08.149 --> 14:09.269
- Let me show you exactly

14:09.279 --> 14:11.080
what I mean.

14:11.090 --> 14:15.039
So a septoplasty caused this.

14:15.049 --> 14:16.159
So let's find out her story,

14:15.049 --> 14:16.159
okay?

14:16.169 --> 14:17.230
Yeah. Wow.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.110
Can you please send in Jessica?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.039
[music]

14:21.049 --> 14:23.080
- Hi.

14:21.049 --> 14:23.080
- Jessica, nice to meet you.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.279
Nice to meet you, too,

14:23.090 --> 14:24.279
Dr. Nassif.

14:24.289 --> 14:26.100
- Hi, Dr. Dubrow.

14:24.289 --> 14:26.100
- Pleasure to meet you.

14:26.110 --> 14:27.259
- Pleasure. This is my--

14:26.110 --> 14:27.259
- Jenny.

14:27.269 --> 14:29.070
- Jenny. Friend?

14:27.269 --> 14:29.070
- Nice to meet you.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.169
- Yeah, best friend.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.169
- Friend? Best friend.

14:30.179 --> 14:33.000
- Oh, yes.

14:30.179 --> 14:33.000
- Best friends for how long?

14:33.009 --> 14:35.070
- Fifteen years now.

14:33.009 --> 14:35.070
- Wow.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.169
We've been best buddies

14:35.080 --> 14:37.169
for how long now?

14:37.179 --> 14:38.190
About 20.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.190
And I absolutely

14:38.200 --> 14:39.190
can't stand him.

14:39.200 --> 14:40.190
Twenty-one.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.090
And I can't stand the guy.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.190
You know, I'm just

14:42.100 --> 14:43.190
so good-looking that, you know,

14:43.200 --> 14:46.029
- you just feel jealous of me.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.029
- Oh, the good-looking thing.

14:46.039 --> 14:47.190
You know what,

14:46.039 --> 14:47.190
I defer to the dolphin

14:47.200 --> 14:48.289
when he says things like that.

14:49.000 --> 14:49.269
You know what the dolphin

14:49.000 --> 14:49.269
would say

14:49.279 --> 14:51.059
when he says good-looking?

14:51.070 --> 14:52.190
[mimics dolphin]

14:51.070 --> 14:52.190
Eh-eh. Eh-eh.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.169
-[laughter]

14:52.200 --> 14:54.169
- Eh-eh.

14:54.179 --> 14:57.080
So, welcome. You've had

14:54.179 --> 14:57.080
some functional surgery

14:57.090 --> 14:59.039
- that's gone wrong.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.039
- Yes.

14:59.049 --> 15:01.019
I had really bad allergies.

15:01.029 --> 15:02.159
- I really couldn't--

15:01.029 --> 15:02.159
- Nasal drip or what?

15:02.169 --> 15:04.080
Bad nasal drip,

15:02.169 --> 15:04.080
and they prescribed

15:04.090 --> 15:06.129
a bunch of different

15:04.090 --> 15:06.129
nasal sprays.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.059
I was using it,

15:06.139 --> 15:08.059
like, five times a day

15:08.070 --> 15:09.149
- at least five years.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.149
- Ooh.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.080
Yeah, it was bad.

15:11.090 --> 15:13.200
When you use

15:11.090 --> 15:13.200
chronic nasal sprays,

15:13.210 --> 15:15.110
decongestants in the nose,

15:15.120 --> 15:17.000
the tissue,

15:15.120 --> 15:17.000
the turbinates in the septum,

15:17.009 --> 15:18.240
you cause a shrink.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.110
But then you get

15:18.250 --> 15:20.110
this rebound effect

15:20.120 --> 15:22.200
when you stop using it

15:20.120 --> 15:22.200
and they get really swollen,

15:22.210 --> 15:24.000
then you can't breathe.

15:24.009 --> 15:25.100
That means you get

15:24.009 --> 15:25.100
addicted to it,

15:25.110 --> 15:26.129
so what you have to do

15:25.110 --> 15:26.129
at that point

15:26.139 --> 15:27.179
is use it again.

15:27.190 --> 15:29.049
So it's a vicious cycle.

15:29.059 --> 15:31.000
When I went and saw the ENT,

15:31.009 --> 15:32.129
he had weaned me off

15:32.139 --> 15:34.000
- the nasal decongestants.

15:32.139 --> 15:34.000
- Okay. Very good.

15:34.009 --> 15:36.039
And I wanted to be able

15:34.009 --> 15:36.039
to breathe normally.

15:36.049 --> 15:39.039
I'm very active.

15:36.049 --> 15:39.039
So, he suggested surgery.

15:39.049 --> 15:41.090
So, did the doctor

15:39.049 --> 15:41.090
say they were gonna do

15:41.100 --> 15:42.269
- septoplasty?

15:41.100 --> 15:42.269
- Septoplasty.

15:42.279 --> 15:44.039
Turbinoplasty?

15:44.049 --> 15:45.100
I heard that one, too,

15:44.049 --> 15:45.100
yes.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.250
So that's a functional surgery

15:47.259 --> 15:49.169
that doesn't change, usually,

15:49.179 --> 15:51.080
the outside appearance

15:49.179 --> 15:51.080
of the nose.

15:51.090 --> 15:53.059
And I had no problem

15:51.090 --> 15:53.059
with the cosmetic side effects.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.080
- So what happened?

15:53.070 --> 15:55.080
- After two weeks,

15:55.090 --> 15:57.070
when all of the packing

15:55.090 --> 15:57.070
started coming out,

15:57.080 --> 15:59.059
he had me sit in a shower.

15:59.070 --> 16:00.289
I would blow it out gently.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.289
It was kind of like black stuff

16:03.000 --> 16:04.210
just coming out of my nose.

16:04.220 --> 16:06.029
It just was not normal.

16:06.039 --> 16:07.149
It's rare that a patient

16:07.159 --> 16:09.100
- takes out their own packing.

16:07.159 --> 16:09.100
- Yeah.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.259
That's what the doctor

16:09.110 --> 16:10.259
is there for.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.049
And in that two-week period,

16:12.059 --> 16:13.149
your nose still

16:12.059 --> 16:13.149
looked the same, right?

16:13.159 --> 16:15.080
- It still looked the same.

16:13.159 --> 16:15.080
- Okay.

16:15.090 --> 16:17.019
And, you know, I eventually

16:15.090 --> 16:17.019
went back in and told him,

16:17.029 --> 16:18.269
- I was like, "Hey, like, I'm--"

16:17.029 --> 16:18.269
- I can't breathe.

16:18.279 --> 16:19.279
"I'm really not breathing."

16:19.289 --> 16:21.169
He suggested a revision.

16:21.179 --> 16:23.279
That's when I started to

16:21.179 --> 16:23.279
notice a lot of this

16:23.289 --> 16:25.289
- was really not...

16:23.289 --> 16:25.289
- It was caving in?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.179
...how it used to be. Yes.

16:27.190 --> 16:31.029
So only after

16:27.190 --> 16:31.029
the second surgery

16:31.039 --> 16:32.169
your nose started looking

16:31.039 --> 16:32.169
different?

16:32.179 --> 16:35.049
Yeah. The bump here

16:32.179 --> 16:35.049
was very visible.

16:35.059 --> 16:36.049
And you still couldn't

16:35.059 --> 16:36.049
breathe now?

16:36.059 --> 16:37.169
Still couldn't breathe.

16:37.179 --> 16:40.159
So, I ended up going

16:37.179 --> 16:40.159
with a new doctor.

16:40.169 --> 16:42.169
Was your breathing a little

16:40.169 --> 16:42.169
better after that surgery?

16:42.179 --> 16:44.059
No. My breathing

16:42.179 --> 16:44.059
was still uncomfortable.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.220
Did your nose change more

16:44.070 --> 16:46.220
cosmetically?

16:46.230 --> 16:47.269
Yeah. It just seemed to get

16:47.279 --> 16:50.129
a little funkier wave going on.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.039
- That was your last surgery?

16:50.139 --> 16:52.039
- Yeah.

16:52.049 --> 16:53.149
After that third surgery,

16:53.159 --> 16:55.080
I fell into a little bit

16:53.159 --> 16:55.080
of depression.

16:55.090 --> 16:56.200
Just going on a date

16:56.210 --> 16:58.120
and eating

16:56.210 --> 16:58.120
in front of somebody,

16:58.129 --> 17:00.039
having to, like,

16:58.129 --> 17:00.039
breathe through my mouth.

17:00.049 --> 17:01.200
When food is falling

17:00.049 --> 17:01.200
out of my mouth

17:01.210 --> 17:05.029
on a first date,

17:01.210 --> 17:05.029
that does not go over well.

17:05.039 --> 17:07.279
And so I've lost

17:05.039 --> 17:07.279
my love life as well.

17:07.289 --> 17:09.000
So the pressure

17:07.289 --> 17:09.000
is on us then?

17:09.009 --> 17:10.079
Pressure is on.

17:11.220 --> 17:13.009
You don't even need

17:11.220 --> 17:13.009
to work out your arms.

17:13.019 --> 17:14.069
It's not fair.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.160
My goal is to look hot.

17:16.170 --> 17:19.069
Your ass is bigger

17:16.170 --> 17:19.069
than Kim Kardashian's.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.119
I'm hoping there's a belly

17:19.079 --> 17:21.119
button sitting in there.

17:21.130 --> 17:23.049
Belly button,

17:21.130 --> 17:23.049
I'm coming for you.

17:23.059 --> 17:25.170
Is there a belly button

17:23.059 --> 17:25.170
beneath this?

17:29.029 --> 17:31.049
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

17:33.039 --> 17:34.099
I'm gonna do an exam first

17:34.109 --> 17:36.069
- on the outside of your nose.

17:34.109 --> 17:36.069
- Yeah.

17:36.079 --> 17:38.089
Turn your head that way

17:36.079 --> 17:38.089
a little bit.

17:38.099 --> 17:41.140
So when you see this here,

17:38.099 --> 17:41.140
I know there's not much support.

17:41.150 --> 17:43.039
DR. DUBROW: Is that the end

17:41.150 --> 17:43.039
of the septum right there?

17:43.049 --> 17:44.220
No. The end of the septum is...

17:44.230 --> 17:46.039
- Way up there?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.039
- ...way over here.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.279
- Oh, my God.

17:46.049 --> 17:47.279
- Okay.

17:47.289 --> 17:48.289
So let me just do

17:47.289 --> 17:48.289
one more thing.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.289
- Okay.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
Any better?

17:53.009 --> 17:54.039
Definitely on the left side.

17:54.049 --> 17:55.099
Okay. Uh...

17:57.049 --> 17:58.250
So, just from our exam,

17:58.259 --> 18:02.039
you do have a complete

17:58.259 --> 18:02.039
saddle-nose deformity,

18:02.049 --> 18:06.170
which means you've lost a lot

18:02.049 --> 18:06.170
of volume from your septum.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.250
Just like you're sitting

18:06.180 --> 18:08.250
on a saddle that's like that,

18:08.259 --> 18:10.250
the middle vault of the nose

18:08.259 --> 18:10.250
which is made out of cartilage,

18:10.259 --> 18:12.150
becomes like a saddle.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.119
How do you correct

18:12.160 --> 18:14.119
a saddle-nose deformity?

18:14.130 --> 18:17.000
You take cartilage,

18:14.130 --> 18:17.000
dice it up into small pieces,

18:17.009 --> 18:19.000
and then you mold it

18:17.009 --> 18:19.000
like spackle

18:19.009 --> 18:21.140
to a hole in a wall right here,

18:21.150 --> 18:23.210
and God willing,

18:21.150 --> 18:23.210
you get a beautiful result.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.109
You have to do

18:23.220 --> 18:25.109
an open rhinoplasty.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.250
- Little incision here.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.250
- JESSICA: Okay.

18:26.259 --> 18:28.059
I need to lift up the skin

18:28.069 --> 18:30.210
and do a septal reconstruction,

18:30.220 --> 18:33.109
put back some of the cartilage

18:30.220 --> 18:33.109
that you had there before

18:33.119 --> 18:35.160
- so it's not gonna collapse in.

18:33.119 --> 18:35.160
- Okay.

18:35.170 --> 18:39.109
Now, here comes the part

18:35.170 --> 18:39.109
with the most cosmetic change.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.160
- Okay.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.160
- Adding alar batten grafts,

18:41.170 --> 18:43.019
pieces of cartilage

18:41.170 --> 18:43.019
that will go on the outside

18:43.029 --> 18:44.180
- of the nose here.

18:43.029 --> 18:44.180
- Okay.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.089
Which will add some fullness

18:44.190 --> 18:46.089
way out over here

18:46.099 --> 18:47.230
- on the side of the nose.

18:46.099 --> 18:47.230
- Okay.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.029
But the breathing

18:47.240 --> 18:50.029
will be a lot better.

18:50.039 --> 18:51.210
JESSICA:

18:50.039 --> 18:51.210
There's a huge difference

18:51.220 --> 18:53.259
from how Dr. Nassif

18:51.220 --> 18:53.259
is approaching this with me

18:53.269 --> 18:56.140
compared to how my previous

18:53.269 --> 18:56.140
two surgeons did.

18:56.150 --> 18:58.049
With Dr. Nassif, I realized

18:58.059 --> 19:01.119
that I'm gonna have

18:58.059 --> 19:01.119
a little bit wider nose.

19:01.130 --> 19:03.029
And, you know,

19:01.130 --> 19:03.029
even looking in the mirror,

19:03.039 --> 19:05.019
and him showing that to me,

19:03.039 --> 19:05.019
it was that extra step

19:05.029 --> 19:06.269
that I really needed to be,

19:05.029 --> 19:06.269
like, "You know what?

19:06.279 --> 19:09.029
"That's not something

19:06.279 --> 19:09.029
that's really gonna bother me

19:09.039 --> 19:11.059
as long as I can breathe

19:09.039 --> 19:11.059
through my nose."

19:11.069 --> 19:13.079
So what happens

19:11.069 --> 19:13.079
if I do all your work

19:13.089 --> 19:16.150

19:13.089 --> 19:16.150
of your airway?

19:16.160 --> 19:19.099
I think, 50% is better

19:16.160 --> 19:19.099
than the zero percent

19:19.109 --> 19:20.269
- that I'm at now.

19:19.109 --> 19:20.269

19:20.279 --> 19:23.000

19:20.279 --> 19:23.000

DR. DUBROW: Obviously, the goal

21:38.190 --> 21:40.250
is to have an abdomen

21:40.259 --> 21:44.019
in which there's only

21:40.259 --> 21:44.019
a horizontal scar.

21:44.029 --> 21:47.019
But that depends on the ability

21:44.029 --> 21:47.019
to get this portion

21:47.029 --> 21:49.130
brought all the way down here

21:49.140 --> 21:52.019
- and remove the skin below it.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.019
- Right.

21:52.029 --> 21:55.059

All right.

For Maritza's surgery today,

22:13.269 --> 22:16.019
I will begin by making

22:13.269 --> 22:16.019
a horizontal incision

22:16.029 --> 22:17.269
across her lower abdomen.

22:17.279 --> 22:20.220
I will then lift up the skin,

22:17.279 --> 22:20.220
remove the skin graft,

22:20.230 --> 22:23.069
and see if I can

22:20.230 --> 22:23.069
find her belly button.

22:23.079 --> 22:25.210
Next, I will sew together

22:23.079 --> 22:25.210
her abdominal muscles,

22:25.220 --> 22:28.029
remove as much of the vertical

22:25.220 --> 22:28.029
scar as possible,

22:28.039 --> 22:30.029
and hopefully

22:28.039 --> 22:30.029
pull her belly button

22:30.039 --> 22:32.130
through before closing her up.

22:32.140 --> 22:35.099
Okay. So let's elevate up

24:03.210 --> 24:06.289
supply and survives,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.160
because if it doesn't,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.160
I'm back to square one.

24:09.170 --> 24:13.049
So, theoretically,

24:09.170 --> 24:13.049
a belly button, isn't it?

24:13.059 --> 24:14.160
HEIDI: Mm-hmm.

24:14.170 --> 24:17.130
All right. Let's sew up

24:14.170 --> 24:17.130
the abdominal wall

24:17.140 --> 24:19.099
and make it flatter.

24:19.109 --> 24:22.210
I'm not sure how much loose

24:19.109 --> 24:22.210
skin that gives me to pull down

24:22.220 --> 24:25.250
and remove as much of

24:22.220 --> 24:25.250
the vertical scar as I'd like.

24:25.259 --> 24:28.230
After sewing Maritza's abdomina

24:25.259 --> 24:28.230
wall muscles together,

24:28.240 --> 24:31.130
the skin didn't really

24:28.240 --> 24:31.130
get that much looser

24:31.140 --> 24:34.019
because of all

24:31.140 --> 24:34.019
the internal scarring

24:34.029 --> 24:36.259
as a result

24:34.029 --> 24:36.259
of her previous complication.

24:36.269 --> 24:38.190
So, unfortunately,

24:36.269 --> 24:38.190
I have to leave her

24:38.200 --> 24:40.259
with a small vertical scar.

24:40.269 --> 24:44.119
Okay.

24:40.269 --> 24:44.119
I've removed two-thirds of it.

24:44.130 --> 24:47.160
Bye-bye, old scar.

24:47.170 --> 24:49.049
Okay. Where's the belly button?

24:49.059 --> 24:50.289
This is what the other surgeon

24:49.059 --> 24:50.289
should have been doing

24:51.000 --> 24:53.059
at the end of the procedure,

24:51.000 --> 24:53.059

24:53.069 --> 24:55.089
out through this hole.

24:55.099 --> 24:56.279

24:56.289 --> 24:59.160

24:56.289 --> 24:59.160

25:20.119 --> 25:21.069

25:20.119 --> 25:21.069
- MARITZA: Hey.

25:21.079 --> 25:22.109
How are you feeling?

25:22.119 --> 25:24.049
- In pain.

25:22.119 --> 25:24.049
- For sure.

25:24.059 --> 25:26.119
I tightened the abdominal

25:24.059 --> 25:26.119
wall muscles.

25:26.130 --> 25:28.029
And then I probably got rid

25:28.039 --> 25:29.170
of two-thirds

25:28.039 --> 25:29.170
of the vertical scar.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.220
- Okay.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.220
- So I think that'll be quite--

25:30.230 --> 25:31.200
And it's way down here, right?

25:31.210 --> 25:32.269
It's way down there.

25:32.279 --> 25:35.200
So then I started to search,

25:35.210 --> 25:37.160
trying to find the belly button.

25:37.170 --> 25:39.240
- And?

25:37.170 --> 25:39.240
- No belly button.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.079
Wow. He probably cut it.

25:42.089 --> 25:45.200
I think he inadvertently

25:42.089 --> 25:45.200
killed the belly button.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.069
So I took a piece of the skin

25:49.079 --> 25:51.190
and I skin grafted that

25:51.200 --> 25:53.029
to try to make a belly button.

25:53.039 --> 25:54.140
Okay.

25:54.150 --> 25:57.000
So the next 72 hours

25:57.009 --> 25:59.079
are critical

25:57.009 --> 25:59.079
for that skin graft,

25:59.089 --> 26:02.049
because we don't want

25:59.089 --> 26:02.049
the skin graft to die

26:02.059 --> 26:04.039
and the whole thing just goes

26:02.059 --> 26:04.039
[imitates deflating]

26:04.049 --> 26:04.289

26:05.000 --> 26:06.180

26:05.000 --> 26:06.180
- All right.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.269
So let's take a look.

26:07.279 --> 26:09.140
So...

26:11.200 --> 26:13.019
It looks alive.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.220
Looks like

26:13.029 --> 26:14.220
a normal belly button.

26:14.230 --> 26:16.049
It looks like

26:14.230 --> 26:16.049
a normal belly button.

26:16.059 --> 26:17.289
Looks good, Mom.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.269
I don't wanna look

26:18.000 --> 26:19.269
at my belly button yet

26:19.279 --> 26:21.200
until it's more healed.

26:21.210 --> 26:24.190
Obviously, Dr. Dubrow told me

26:21.210 --> 26:24.190
it looks really good.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.190
It looks great. But that's also

26:24.200 --> 26:27.190
what my first surgeon told me,

26:27.200 --> 26:28.289
you know,

26:27.200 --> 26:28.289
that it looked excellent

26:29.000 --> 26:31.069
after my skin graft,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.069
and it didn't.

26:31.079 --> 26:34.200
So I just don't feel comfortable

26:31.079 --> 26:34.200

27:18.220 --> 27:20.210
- Okay.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.210
- Because that's rib.

27:22.079 --> 27:23.259
this tip is almost

27:22.079 --> 27:23.259

27:52.009 --> 27:53.269
Dr. Peng will harvest rib

27:53.279 --> 27:56.019
while I begin by

27:53.279 --> 27:56.019
opening up the nose.

27:56.029 --> 27:57.279
Next, we'll assess the septum

27:57.289 --> 28:00.049
before rebuilding the nose

27:57.289 --> 28:00.049
with spreader grafts

28:00.059 --> 28:01.269
so she can breathe better,

28:01.279 --> 28:04.170
and a septal extension graft

28:01.279 --> 28:04.170
for support.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.210
Finally, we will use

28:04.180 --> 28:07.210
a diced cartilage glue graft

28:07.220 --> 28:09.069
to build up the dorsum

28:09.079 --> 28:11.289
and correct her saddle nose

28:09.079 --> 28:11.289
deformity.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.200
Okay,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.200
I'm making my incision now.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.049
I'm cutting on the skin.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
DR. PENG: All right.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
So the rib is coming out.

28:25.009 --> 28:26.240
I have a nice piece of rib.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.130

28:28.140 --> 28:29.259

28:29.269 --> 28:31.190
So I did find

28:29.269 --> 28:31.190
a piece of the septum.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.079
I'm still working at it.

28:33.089 --> 28:35.099
The reason why

28:33.089 --> 28:35.099
you perform a septoplasty

28:35.109 --> 28:37.089
is to correct

28:35.109 --> 28:37.089
a deviated septum.

28:37.099 --> 28:39.220
That means the septum

28:37.099 --> 28:39.220
is pushed over

28:39.230 --> 28:41.079
and blocking

28:39.230 --> 28:41.079
one of the airways.

28:41.089 --> 28:44.079
However, you have

28:41.089 --> 28:44.079
to make sure you leave

28:44.089 --> 28:46.279
enough cartilage behind

28:44.089 --> 28:46.279
so this doesn't cave in.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.130
In Jessica's case,

28:48.140 --> 28:51.029
it looks like the doctors

28:48.140 --> 28:51.029
were too overzealous

28:51.039 --> 28:52.220
and they cut too much septum.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.079
Then you put spreader grafts,

28:54.089 --> 28:56.210
our diced cartilage

28:54.089 --> 28:56.210
glue graft,

28:56.220 --> 28:58.289
and a septal extension graft

28:59.000 --> 29:01.039
to rebuild her nose right now.

29:01.049 --> 29:03.029
We're adding some support

29:01.049 --> 29:03.029
to the nose, huh?

29:03.039 --> 29:06.099

even in a fire.

30:18.250 --> 30:21.200
- What happened?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.200
- SHAUNA: Um...

30:21.210 --> 30:26.140
There was a little bit

30:21.210 --> 30:26.140
of a smoke in the kitchen,

30:26.150 --> 30:27.240
so it set it off.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.170
It's from the toaster.

30:29.180 --> 30:32.000
DR. NASSIF: So how could

30:29.180 --> 30:32.000
someone have done that?

30:32.009 --> 30:33.109
Thank God,

30:32.009 --> 30:33.109
it wasn't a real fire,

30:33.119 --> 30:35.240
but whoever left

30:33.119 --> 30:35.240
their pita sandwich,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.240
their Hot Pocket,

30:35.250 --> 30:37.240
or whatever it was

30:37.250 --> 30:39.150
in the toaster for too long,

30:39.160 --> 30:41.150
you almost had us

30:39.160 --> 30:41.150
waking up Jessica

30:41.160 --> 30:43.130
and walking out

30:41.160 --> 30:43.130
of the operating room

30:43.140 --> 30:47.099
in Beverly Hills with two-thirds

30:43.140 --> 30:47.099
of a septorhinoplasty done.

30:47.109 --> 30:50.059
Okay,

30:47.109 --> 30:50.059
so we're rebuilding the tip,

30:50.069 --> 30:52.150
giving the tip

30:50.069 --> 30:52.150
plenty of projection.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.150
DR. PENG: It looks really pretty

30:52.160 --> 30:54.150
from my side.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.109
DR. NASSIF: That's how

30:54.160 --> 30:56.109
you want pretty much

30:56.119 --> 30:58.079
every pretty nose

30:56.119 --> 30:58.079
to look like.

30:58.089 --> 30:59.130
That looks great.

30:59.140 --> 31:00.259
Beautiful result.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.150
Thank you.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.150
Thank you. Thank you.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.250
[grunts]

31:04.259 --> 31:07.289
[music]

31:11.210 --> 31:13.099
- JESSICA: Hi.

31:11.210 --> 31:13.099
- DR. PENG: How are you doing?

31:13.109 --> 31:15.019
- DR. NASSIF: Hello, you two.

31:13.109 --> 31:15.019
- JESSICA: Hi.

31:15.029 --> 31:17.019
- How you doing?

31:15.029 --> 31:17.019
- I feel good.

31:17.029 --> 31:19.000
- How's your rib?

31:17.029 --> 31:19.000
- My rib's good.

31:19.009 --> 31:20.119
Can you lift up your shirt?

31:19.009 --> 31:20.119
Let's just see it.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.250
- Okay. That's good.

31:20.130 --> 31:21.250
- JENNY: Do you need help?

31:21.259 --> 31:23.029
DR. NASSIF:

31:21.259 --> 31:23.029
And can keep that on.

31:23.039 --> 31:24.019
- Yup. Yup.

31:23.039 --> 31:24.019
- DR. NASSIF: That's easy.

31:24.029 --> 31:26.059
Put your head back for me.

31:26.069 --> 31:28.000
- Okay.

31:26.069 --> 31:28.000
- Whoa.

31:28.009 --> 31:29.130
DR. NASSIF:

31:28.009 --> 31:29.130
All right. Fantastic. Okay.

31:29.140 --> 31:32.119
All right.

31:29.140 --> 31:32.119
So how much is your breathing

31:32.130 --> 31:35.109
gonna be better

31:32.130 --> 31:35.109
at the end of all this?

31:35.119 --> 31:38.039
- Probably 50%, 60%.

31:35.119 --> 31:38.039
- Awesome.

31:38.049 --> 31:40.069
My experience

31:38.049 --> 31:40.069
with Dr. Nassif has been--

31:40.079 --> 31:42.279
I almost feel like

31:40.079 --> 31:42.279
he's like the dad of surgery.

31:42.289 --> 31:44.160
I don't know

31:42.289 --> 31:44.160
if that sounds strange

31:44.170 --> 31:47.039
but like I felt

31:44.170 --> 31:47.039
in such good hands.

31:47.049 --> 31:49.059
Now, you have

31:47.049 --> 31:49.059
all the instructions on a sheet.

31:49.069 --> 31:50.069
Yes.

31:50.079 --> 31:51.109
DR. NASSIF:

31:50.079 --> 31:51.109
Please follow those.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.049
I have very diligently,

31:51.119 --> 31:53.049
I promise.

31:53.059 --> 31:55.049
I wish all my patients

31:53.059 --> 31:55.049
would look this great...

31:55.059 --> 31:56.259
- Yeah.

31:55.059 --> 31:56.259
- ...one day after surgery.

31:56.269 --> 32:00.130
Yeah. I just seriously wanna

31:56.269 --> 32:00.130
say thank you to Dr. Nassif.

32:00.140 --> 32:01.150
He's--

32:03.269 --> 32:07.230
he's made a big impact

32:03.269 --> 32:07.230
on my life so...

32:07.240 --> 32:09.150
I'm thankful for him.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.140
And, um...

32:13.109 --> 32:17.009
yeah, just being able

32:13.109 --> 32:17.009
to have this opportunity

32:17.019 --> 32:18.130
is definitely gonna change

32:17.019 --> 32:18.130
my life.

32:18.140 --> 32:20.059
All right.

32:18.140 --> 32:20.059
We'll see you later on.

32:20.069 --> 32:21.180
- And this, by the way...

32:20.069 --> 32:21.180
- I know.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.220
- ...you can get rid of that.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.220
- It's my jewelry.

32:23.230 --> 32:25.009
- It's good to see you.

32:23.230 --> 32:25.009
- It's nice meet you.

32:25.019 --> 32:26.140
- Yeah. Thank you.

32:25.019 --> 32:26.140
- Well done.

32:32.099 --> 32:35.019
DR. DUBROW:

32:32.099 --> 32:35.019
This gentleman named Barak

32:35.029 --> 32:38.210
has had a number

32:35.029 --> 32:38.210
of plastic surgery procedures

32:38.220 --> 32:40.289
to make him look more muscular.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.240
Mainly injectable silicone.

32:43.250 --> 32:46.109
DR. NASSIF: So that's all

32:43.250 --> 32:46.109
liquid silicone in the arms?

32:46.119 --> 32:48.089
DR. DUBROW: I think most of this

32:46.119 --> 32:48.089
is silicone.

32:48.099 --> 32:49.180
Really?

32:49.190 --> 32:51.009
I've never really heard

32:51.019 --> 32:52.190
of anybody getting

32:51.019 --> 32:52.190
free silicone injected

32:52.200 --> 32:54.250
in their arms to make them

32:52.200 --> 32:54.250
look bigger.

32:54.259 --> 32:57.130
So I don't know.

32:54.259 --> 32:57.130
Is this migration?

32:57.140 --> 32:59.150
Is this a granuloma?

32:57.140 --> 32:59.150
I don't know.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.000
Let's see

32:59.160 --> 33:01.000
if we can help him, okay?

33:01.009 --> 33:03.000
Will you please send in Barak?

33:04.150 --> 33:06.000
- DR. DUBROW: There he is.

33:04.150 --> 33:06.000
- Hey.

33:06.009 --> 33:07.079
- Nice to meet you.

33:06.009 --> 33:07.079
- Barak.

33:07.089 --> 33:08.150
- Hi, Barak. Terry Dubrow.

33:07.089 --> 33:08.150
- Niko. Pleasure to meet you.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.079
- Nice to meet you.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.079
- Niko?

33:10.089 --> 33:12.099
- Gods of plastic surgery.

33:10.089 --> 33:12.099
- DR. NASSIF: Look at them.

33:12.109 --> 33:14.289
Both these guys

33:12.109 --> 33:14.289
have the tats on the arms.

33:15.000 --> 33:15.259
- Yeah.

33:15.000 --> 33:15.259
- NIKO: We're trying to keep up.

33:15.269 --> 33:17.190
We have a lot of tattoos.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.019
DR. NASSIF: What's the

33:17.200 --> 33:19.019
relationship between you two?

33:19.029 --> 33:20.109
- BARAK: We were dating.

33:19.029 --> 33:20.109
- NIKO: Yeah.

33:20.119 --> 33:22.019
Well, we were actually engaged

33:20.119 --> 33:22.019
at one point.

33:22.029 --> 33:23.190
- Really?

33:22.029 --> 33:23.190
- Yeah. We went to Paris

33:23.200 --> 33:25.190
and we got engaged

33:23.200 --> 33:25.190
under the Eiffel Tower.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.130
- Oh, wow.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.130
- BARAK: Until he left me.

33:27.140 --> 33:29.059
Yeah, and then he left me

33:27.140 --> 33:29.059
for getting plastic surgery.

33:29.069 --> 33:30.279
- Yeah.

33:29.069 --> 33:30.279
- What? Wait. What? Wait. What?

33:30.289 --> 33:32.079
NIKO:

33:30.289 --> 33:32.079
But, like, we stayed friends.

33:32.089 --> 33:34.109
- We still are very close.

33:32.089 --> 33:34.109
- Fantastic.

33:34.119 --> 33:36.250
NIKO: Well, then he convinced

33:34.119 --> 33:36.250
to get something,

33:36.259 --> 33:38.160
- so I had my abs done.

33:36.259 --> 33:38.160
- DR. DUBROW: Wait, wait, wait.

33:38.170 --> 33:41.059
So you left Barak because

33:38.170 --> 33:41.059
he was way too interested

33:41.069 --> 33:42.190
in plastic surgery

33:41.069 --> 33:42.190
and into himself.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.269
Yeah. Yes.

33:43.279 --> 33:45.069
DR. DUBROW:

33:43.279 --> 33:45.069
And then you ended up...

33:45.079 --> 33:47.279
Well, then, like,

33:45.079 --> 33:47.279
I saw how, like, he changed

33:47.289 --> 33:49.150
and, like, his whole image,

33:49.160 --> 33:51.009
everything about him

33:49.160 --> 33:51.009
was different.

33:51.019 --> 33:52.150
And I've always wanted my abs.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.039
I figured,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.039
"I'm not gonna inject anything.

33:54.049 --> 33:55.170
Let me just sculpt."

33:55.180 --> 33:57.130
So you had sculpting?

33:55.180 --> 33:57.130
You had 3D etching done?

33:57.140 --> 33:58.180
- NIKO: Yeah.

33:57.140 --> 33:58.180
- Can we see it?

33:58.190 --> 33:59.279
- Yeah. Yeah.

33:58.190 --> 33:59.279
- Stand for us.

33:59.289 --> 34:01.200
Yeah. Show them.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.289
Okay.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.150
BARAK:

34:03.000 --> 34:04.150
Yeah. They did a good job.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.190
- DR. DUBROW: Wow.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.190
- NIKO: We just had it. Yeah.

34:05.200 --> 34:06.210
DR. NASSIF: How long ago

34:05.200 --> 34:06.210
did you have it?

34:06.220 --> 34:08.019
NIKO: Five and a half weeks ago.

34:08.030 --> 34:09.210
- DR. DUBROW: Crazy.

34:08.030 --> 34:09.210
- NIKO: Yeah.

34:09.219 --> 34:11.210
DR. DUBROW: So those aren't

34:09.219 --> 34:11.210
your abdominal wall muscles?

34:11.219 --> 34:13.099
- That is fat.

34:11.219 --> 34:13.099
- BARAK: No. That's fat.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.119
Yeah. That's what we call them.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.130
- We call them fabs.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.130
- Fabs?

34:16.139 --> 34:17.280
- My fat abs.

34:16.139 --> 34:17.280
- Yeah.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.019
Maybe that's what

34:17.289 --> 34:20.019
I should do.

34:20.030 --> 34:22.130
Oh, this--

34:20.030 --> 34:22.130
this was the best thing.

34:22.139 --> 34:24.139
- I am so happy.

34:22.139 --> 34:24.139
- [laughter]

34:24.150 --> 34:27.280
You know, it's funny because

34:24.150 --> 34:27.280
you said you had the facelift.

34:27.289 --> 34:30.150
I just went and had

34:27.289 --> 34:30.150
a deep plane facelift

34:30.159 --> 34:32.070
with less than 24 hours ago.

34:32.079 --> 34:34.139
You had surgery?!

34:34.150 --> 34:37.010
Are you ----ing kidding me?

34:37.019 --> 34:38.150
I got it eight months ago.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.170
I was actually inspired by you.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.019
Hey. Hey. Hey.

34:42.030 --> 34:44.130
So his facelift inspired

34:42.030 --> 34:44.130
your facelift?

34:44.139 --> 34:46.079
Well, it's funny

34:44.139 --> 34:46.079
'cause so many people

34:46.090 --> 34:48.079
always talk about

34:46.090 --> 34:48.079
on our social media

34:48.090 --> 34:49.280
- how similar they look.

34:48.090 --> 34:49.280
- Really?

34:49.289 --> 34:51.170
- Oh, all my comments is like...

34:49.289 --> 34:51.170
- You're like twins?

34:51.179 --> 34:53.280
- Before I got my facelift.

34:51.179 --> 34:53.280
- Oh.

34:53.289 --> 34:55.219
[laughter]

34:55.230 --> 34:58.010
DR. DUBROW:

34:55.230 --> 34:58.010
Before I got my face--

34:59.179 --> 35:01.150
So I know

34:59.179 --> 35:01.150
you're having some issues

35:01.159 --> 35:03.099
- with the silicone...

35:01.159 --> 35:03.099
- BARAK: Yes.

35:03.110 --> 35:05.050
- ...but is this the look

35:03.110 --> 35:05.050
that you wanted to achieve?

35:05.059 --> 35:06.210
- Am I right about this?

35:05.059 --> 35:06.210
- Right. Well, you know,

35:06.219 --> 35:08.269
I was always obsessed

35:06.219 --> 35:08.269
with superheroes

35:08.280 --> 35:10.230
and I always liked to work out,

35:10.239 --> 35:12.039
you know? And I realized,

35:12.050 --> 35:14.019
"Hmm, I wanna have that body."

35:14.030 --> 35:15.190
How much did you end up

35:14.030 --> 35:15.190
with in each arm?

35:15.199 --> 35:18.039
Probably each arm,

35:15.199 --> 35:18.039
1,200 cc and 1,000 cc.

35:18.050 --> 35:20.139
- Whoa. Where?

35:18.050 --> 35:20.139
- To--Mexico City.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.190
- Mexico City?

35:20.150 --> 35:21.190
- Uh-huh.

35:21.199 --> 35:22.230
It got legal in Mexico

35:21.199 --> 35:22.230
to do this?

35:22.239 --> 35:24.139
BARAK: Yeah. It's legal. Yeah.

35:24.150 --> 35:26.210
Did you get silicone injected

35:24.150 --> 35:26.210
anywhere else in your body?

35:26.219 --> 35:27.280
- No.

35:26.219 --> 35:27.280
- Oh!

35:27.289 --> 35:30.050
So I--so I--yes.

35:27.289 --> 35:30.050
So I haven't--yes.

35:30.059 --> 35:32.210
[laughs] "No, no, no.

35:30.059 --> 35:32.210
Yes, yes, yes."

35:32.219 --> 35:34.219
So I did. I did.

35:32.219 --> 35:34.219
So I had in my lips.

35:34.230 --> 35:38.059
And three years ago--

35:34.230 --> 35:38.059
I always wanted a nose job

35:38.070 --> 35:41.019
but I didn't wanna

35:38.070 --> 35:41.019
really to have a surgery.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.139
So I went to a doctor

35:41.030 --> 35:43.139
and he said,

35:43.150 --> 35:45.239
- "Okay, I put filler in you."

35:43.150 --> 35:45.239
- Was it silicone?

35:45.250 --> 35:49.150
Yeah, it was silicone

35:45.250 --> 35:49.150
injections. Yes.

35:49.159 --> 35:52.000
- Okay.

35:49.159 --> 35:52.000
- BARAK: Over--yeah.

35:52.010 --> 35:54.130
I've never seen or heard

35:54.139 --> 35:56.099
of this much silicone

35:56.110 --> 35:58.110
being placed

35:56.110 --> 35:58.110
in any part of the body.

35:58.119 --> 36:01.150
The immune system can wall off

35:58.119 --> 36:01.150
various aspects

36:01.159 --> 36:03.070
of the silicone

36:01.159 --> 36:03.070
and form nodules.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.239
They can be very painful

36:04.250 --> 36:06.150
and cosmetically deforming,

36:06.159 --> 36:10.010
and difficult

36:06.159 --> 36:10.010
if not impossible to remove,

36:10.019 --> 36:12.070
and it's a real scary thing.

36:12.079 --> 36:13.079
So are you having problems

36:12.079 --> 36:13.079
with your arms?

36:13.090 --> 36:14.170
BARAK: Yes, I do.

36:14.179 --> 36:17.039
You see I have like

36:14.179 --> 36:17.039
balls here and here.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.110
And so--

36:17.050 --> 36:18.110
you can see in the upper...

36:18.119 --> 36:20.079
- Are they hard?

36:18.119 --> 36:20.079
- This one is hard

36:20.090 --> 36:22.210
and those ones

36:20.090 --> 36:22.210
are the hardest.

36:22.219 --> 36:24.019
- DR. DUBROW: Wow.

36:22.219 --> 36:24.019
- But it seems like

36:24.030 --> 36:25.150
it's growing, you know?

36:25.159 --> 36:27.159
Your story is fascinating.

36:27.170 --> 36:29.219
It's really all about

36:27.170 --> 36:29.219
the complication

36:29.230 --> 36:32.110
of silicone injections,

36:29.230 --> 36:32.110
which are these granulomas.

36:32.119 --> 36:33.250
So we'll examine you

36:32.119 --> 36:33.250
very carefully

36:33.260 --> 36:35.159
and determine what

36:33.260 --> 36:35.159
the best options are, okay?

36:35.170 --> 36:38.070
- Sounds good.

36:35.170 --> 36:38.070
- Okay. So let's go have a look.

Well, it's all over.

- BARAK: Yeah. Of course.

37:41.230 --> 37:44.070
DR. DUBROW: Turn this way.

37:41.230 --> 37:44.070
Okay. So let's see.

37:44.079 --> 37:45.219
- Yeah.

37:44.079 --> 37:45.219
- BARAK: Yeah.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.119
It worked here.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.119
What does this say?

37:47.130 --> 37:48.179
BARAK: "Do not enter."

37:48.190 --> 37:52.059
[laughter]

37:52.070 --> 37:55.179
If Paul got a tattoo

37:52.070 --> 37:55.179
above his butt,

37:55.190 --> 37:57.190
I would want it to say,

37:57.199 --> 37:59.199
"If you can smell this,

37:57.199 --> 37:59.199
you're too close."

37:59.210 --> 38:01.199
[laughs]

38:03.250 --> 38:05.070
Squeeze my fingers.

38:05.079 --> 38:08.150
Okay. Now, resist my push

38:05.079 --> 38:08.150
that way.

38:08.159 --> 38:09.230
- That's good. No nerve damage.

38:08.159 --> 38:09.230
- No. No.

38:09.239 --> 38:12.159
Now, do this.

38:09.239 --> 38:12.159
Now, flex your wrist

38:12.170 --> 38:14.190
and then push the other way.

38:14.199 --> 38:16.090
Okay. Yeah, good strength,

38:14.199 --> 38:16.090
that's for sure.

38:16.099 --> 38:18.130
So no weak--

38:16.099 --> 38:18.130
there's no motor weakness.

38:18.139 --> 38:20.260
I have nothing.

38:18.139 --> 38:20.260
I lift a lot, obviously.

38:20.269 --> 38:23.050
Yeah. Here's the thing.

38:23.059 --> 38:28.010
Your granuloma is encasing

38:28.019 --> 38:30.269
but not impairing your nerve.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.269
Theoretically,

38:31.280 --> 38:33.150
an incision could be made

38:33.159 --> 38:37.119
and you could dissect out

38:33.159 --> 38:37.119
the granuloma.

38:37.130 --> 38:38.269
But if you do that,

38:38.280 --> 38:42.210
I mean, you have a significant

38:38.280 --> 38:42.210
risk of nerve injury,

38:42.219 --> 38:45.039
which is a partial paralysis.

38:45.050 --> 38:47.039
Here's the thing, Barak--

38:47.050 --> 38:48.239
you do have some granulomas,

38:48.250 --> 38:50.139
but you know, typically,

38:50.150 --> 38:53.119
they kind of occur, they move,

38:53.130 --> 38:55.260
and then they stay quiet.

38:55.269 --> 39:00.230
And let's let sleeping

38:55.269 --> 39:00.230
granulomas lie.

39:00.239 --> 39:02.280
Right now,

39:00.239 --> 39:02.280
the silicone I have in my arms

39:02.289 --> 39:04.139
are not a big health issue,

39:04.150 --> 39:06.159
so I am very happy,

39:06.170 --> 39:09.239
and I hope the bump stays

39:06.170 --> 39:09.239
the same size

39:09.250 --> 39:11.019
and do not move.

39:11.030 --> 39:12.019
I love my arms.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.280
I like the way I look,

39:13.289 --> 39:15.070
and if people don't like it,

39:15.079 --> 39:18.070
it's their problem,

39:15.079 --> 39:18.070
not mine.

39:18.079 --> 39:20.059
Would you do me a favor? Would

39:18.079 --> 39:20.059
you stand up for a second?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.030

39:35.039 --> 39:36.219

three failed surgeries,

39:37.250 --> 39:39.250
I still couldn't breathe.

39:39.260 --> 39:41.289
And then the look of my nose

39:39.260 --> 39:41.289
was completely destroyed.

I was miserable,

39:42.000 --> 39:44.289

41:26.090 --> 41:29.219
It took about four weeks

41:26.090 --> 41:29.219
to look at my belly button.

41:29.230 --> 41:31.170
I was a little bit afraid

41:31.179 --> 41:34.019
because of what I went through

41:31.179 --> 41:34.019
with my first tummy tuck,

41:34.030 --> 41:36.019
but once I did,

41:36.030 --> 41:37.280
I feel liberated.

41:37.289 --> 41:39.190
♪ I know we'll overcome ♪

41:39.199 --> 41:41.099
♪ Oh, oh ♪

41:41.110 --> 41:43.210
Whoo! Champagne, ladies.

41:43.219 --> 41:46.030
I have a complete body.

41:46.039 --> 41:47.130
I'm whole again.

41:47.139 --> 41:49.119
I'm a new person.

41:49.130 --> 41:51.070
- [women screaming]

41:49.130 --> 41:51.070
- [laughter]

41:51.079 --> 41:54.010
I think my mom looks stunning.

41:54.019 --> 41:56.030
I don't think

41:54.019 --> 41:56.030
I've ever seen her this happy.

41:56.039 --> 41:57.210
She's changed tremendously

41:57.219 --> 42:00.170
from attitude

41:57.219 --> 42:00.170
to her physical body,

42:00.179 --> 42:01.269
emotionally.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.119
She's all of our superhero.

42:03.130 --> 42:05.000
She has been through so much

42:05.010 --> 42:07.059
and for her to still be

42:05.010 --> 42:07.059
doing it all and looking good,

42:07.070 --> 42:09.250
it's great.

42:07.070 --> 42:09.250
It's great call her our mom.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.110
- ALL: Cheers.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.110
- Cheers to new body,

42:11.119 --> 42:12.280
- the new Maritza.

42:11.119 --> 42:12.280
- Yay.

42:12.289 --> 42:15.099
Before my surgery

42:12.289 --> 42:15.099
I had no belly button

42:15.110 --> 42:18.210
and ugly scars going across

42:15.110 --> 42:18.210
and up my stomach

42:18.219 --> 42:20.039
that resembled Frankenstein.

42:20.050 --> 42:22.039
But now,

42:20.050 --> 42:22.039
thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:22.050 --> 42:24.000
my stomach is beautiful.

42:24.010 --> 42:27.090
He removed two-thirds

42:24.010 --> 42:27.090
of the vertical scar

42:27.099 --> 42:30.039
so I'm able to wear

42:27.099 --> 42:30.039
high-cut bikinis,

42:30.050 --> 42:32.260
and it's not very visible.

42:32.269 --> 42:35.039
I'm completely in love

42:32.269 --> 42:35.039
with my belly button

42:35.050 --> 42:36.250
that Dr. Dubrow created.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.280
It's something that

42:36.260 --> 42:38.280
I didn't know was possible.

42:38.289 --> 42:40.210
Rest in peace,

42:38.289 --> 42:40.210
old belly button.

42:40.219 --> 42:43.119
Dr. Dubrow and Dr. Nassif

42:40.219 --> 42:43.119
listened to me,

42:43.130 --> 42:46.039
and they were honest with me

42:43.130 --> 42:46.039
throughout the whole procedure.

42:46.050 --> 42:47.090
They cared for you

42:46.050 --> 42:47.090
the way we did.

42:47.099 --> 42:48.150
- Yeah.

42:47.099 --> 42:48.150
- Yes.

42:48.159 --> 42:50.019
They gave so much empathy.

42:50.030 --> 42:53.050
They literally restored my faith

42:50.030 --> 42:53.050
in doctors once again.

42:53.059 --> 42:55.280
Loving myself

42:53.059 --> 42:55.280
is my biggest reward,

42:55.289 --> 42:58.050
because in order

42:55.289 --> 42:58.050
for anyone else to love me,

42:58.059 --> 43:00.030
I have to love myself first.

43:00.039 --> 43:02.150
You guys are my rock

43:00.039 --> 43:02.150
and I'm forever grateful.

43:02.159 --> 43:04.030
I love you, guys.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.150
- We love you too, Mom.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.150
- Thank you.

43:05.159 --> 43:07.159
You're the mom,

43:05.159 --> 43:07.159
the dad, the sister,

43:07.170 --> 43:08.170
the best friend.

43:07.170 --> 43:08.170
You're everything.

43:08.179 --> 43:10.050
ALY: We really only have you.

43:10.059 --> 43:12.050
Now she's gonna be the friend

43:10.059 --> 43:12.050
that borrows clothes

43:12.059 --> 43:13.230
and doesn't return it.

43:13.239 --> 43:15.150
You might wanna

43:13.239 --> 43:15.150
lock your closets, girls.

43:15.159 --> 43:17.119
- [laughter]

43:15.159 --> 43:17.119
- Yeah. Yeah.

43:17.130 --> 43:19.170
This has taken over my life.

43:19.179 --> 43:21.159
I was completely flat-chested.

43:21.170 --> 43:22.159
How many operations

43:21.170 --> 43:22.159
did you have?

43:22.170 --> 43:23.260
WOMAN: Four--fifteen.

43:23.269 --> 43:26.099
- Fifteen?

43:23.269 --> 43:26.099
- Fifteen breast surgeries?

43:26.110 --> 43:27.239
Harder!

43:27.250 --> 43:29.059
I have spent over

43:27.250 --> 43:29.059
one million dollars

43:29.070 --> 43:31.260
on plastic surgery

43:29.070 --> 43:31.260
and procedures,

43:31.269 --> 43:33.289
and I am only 19 years old.

43:34.000 --> 43:35.150
MAN: When I was forming

43:34.000 --> 43:35.150
in the womb,

43:35.159 --> 43:38.150
the IUD had pushed up

43:35.159 --> 43:38.150
against my face.

43:38.159 --> 43:39.219
- No kidding?

43:38.159 --> 43:39.219
- MAN: Yeah.

43:39.230 --> 43:41.230
You have a really complicated,

43:41.239 --> 43:44.219
big question mark,

43:41.239 --> 43:44.219
unknown situation.
