02:21.720 --> 02:24.792
These people are trying way too hard.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.236
Jerry, I hired you
to handle my art, not me.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.470
Aren't you Edward's friend?

02:33.560 --> 02:35.551
Ed? Oh!

02:36.120 --> 02:39.032
Who I consider a waste of human flesh?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.429
As usual, isn't here.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.035
He should be chasing you,
not a Nobel Prize.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.314
Look, Jerry...

02:46.400 --> 02:50.313
This is my first showing.
Don't add to the pressure.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.871
Ed doesn't appreciate you.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.988
I got held up. How's it going?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.033
Fine!

03:10.320 --> 03:13.118
(LAUGHS) Timing is everything.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.395
And, as usual, yours sucks.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.715
- Where's the big hand?
- On two.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.633
- And the little hand?
- Eleven.

03:30.760 --> 03:31.875
So, it's...

03:32.600 --> 03:35.433
- 1 1 :1 0.
- He can tell the time (!)

03:35.600 --> 03:39.559
But he's five hours late
to something important to me.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.836
I'm sorry! I do know that.

03:41.920 --> 03:45.151
I got a codable sign wave
out of a cadaver.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.714
Good - a slab of decaying flesh.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.111
I'm digitising the components of memory.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.239
Of thought.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.949
They'll be mapped
on a neural net in a computer.

03:57.080 --> 04:03.030
Computers will house people's memories,
thoughts, and let them live forever.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.869
OK. I support your work, whatever it is.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.838
I want you to do the same for me.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.276
Tell me in ten seconds
why I shouldn't leave you.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.834
I can belch the national anthem?

04:20.959 --> 04:23.997
That takes longer than ten seconds.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.751
How about this?

04:31.560 --> 04:34.233
That needs more than ten seconds too.

04:35.120 --> 04:36.997
Depends on the big hand.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.151
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.909
CLEARS THROAT

05:27.080 --> 05:29.116
Uh... Yes?

05:29.280 --> 05:33.239
God, I... I just... hate to interrupt you,
but...

05:33.400 --> 05:38.474
I need you to help me move the goods.
People want to meet you.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.911
Come on.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.514
Do I have to tie you up?

05:44.680 --> 05:45.829
(SIGHS)

05:46.000 --> 05:48.355
- What?
- I have to go back.

05:48.520 --> 05:52.195
- Don't even think about it.
- I made a breakthrough.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.035
This isn't funny anymore. I can't do this.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.031
- That my wine?
- I...

05:59.120 --> 06:00.838
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.759
- Thanks.
- Anytime, tiger.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.636
- Let me help.
- Thanks. I need lots of help.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.313
- How's that?
- Good.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.471
- You OK?
- Yes.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.989
(SIGHS) It's sad when the mind is sharp,
but the body's weak.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.838
I...

06:45.960 --> 06:48.713
Fate is such a funny thing.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.713
- Good night, Mr Adams.
- Good night.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.751
How do you know my name?

07:18.720 --> 07:20.711
INSTRUMENTS BEEPING

07:21.600 --> 07:23.750
(SIGHS) What's wrong?

07:24.840 --> 07:28.435
I almost tapped into
your memory an hour ago.

07:30.520 --> 07:34.559
I could see your thoughts
as if I had been there myself.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.232
Come on.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.550
LOUD BEEPING

07:44.320 --> 07:48.313
Come on, Travis.
Make me see what you see.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.111
Surprise, surprise.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.237
- Knew I'd find you here.
- Grab a toe-tag.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.033
- Make yourself at home.
- Oof!

08:03.520 --> 08:07.433
Still doing secret research
on these poor bastards?

08:07.560 --> 08:11.439
Without a decent grant,
I have to do guerrilla science.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.557
I bribe the security guy with a six-pack.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.517
Travis Mitchell?

08:17.520 --> 08:19.829
This is so grotesque.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.439
Nobody gives a shit. These guys are
courtesy of the state prison system.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.034
This one's a serial killer.

08:29.120 --> 08:35.070
You're not interested in the activities
of the dead. What do you want?

08:35.200 --> 08:39.716
Remember we used to toss a coin
over who gets the girl?

08:39.840 --> 08:44.277
- Could we toss a coin over Britt?
- She's not mine to toss away.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.228
She won't move on
until she's finished with you,

08:48.320 --> 08:50.311
and you only care about this.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.869
I can make a difference to humanity.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.355
You'll lose her anyway.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.950
Make it easy on all of us -
bow out gracefully.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.759
Why don't you let Britt decide?

09:01.840 --> 09:06.311
She's a big girl.
She knows what she can handle.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.674
BEEPING

09:07.840 --> 09:10.832
Shit! You are such a prick!

09:12.320 --> 09:17.519
You'll just give everybody grief,
and in the end, nobody wins.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.589
Thanks for dropping by, Jer.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.991
BEEPING

09:51.760 --> 09:53.751
Come on. That's it.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.911
(SCREAMS)

10:41.120 --> 10:43.111
(SCREAMS)

10:53.200 --> 10:55.191
"No!"

11:20.800 --> 11:22.791
Oh, my God.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.751
(PANTS) The rage.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.114
- Professor Ellis!
- Edward, hi.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.193
Oh, I'm sorry.
The Board turned down your grant.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.635
I did everything I could.

11:49.720 --> 11:54.430
It was close, but one guy said no
and wouldn't change his mind.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.317
We have to convince him.

11:56.480 --> 11:59.916
You'll have to wait till next cycle.

12:00.080 --> 12:04.153
I tapped into the memory
of a cadaver at the lab!

12:04.240 --> 12:08.552
The top grants went to AIDS research,
cancer research

12:08.640 --> 12:12.030
and an intercranial pressure device.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.270
No money for exotic theories.

12:14.400 --> 12:19.997
- But you know how significant this is.
- That's science in the '90s.

12:20.120 --> 12:24.318
I can't keep doing pirate research.
I need money!

12:24.440 --> 12:26.590
We'll have to find another way.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.512
This will feel cold, but try not to move.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.759
How's it feel?

12:58.920 --> 13:02.117
- Feels kind of sexy.
- Yeah, I know.

13:05.920 --> 13:11.438
This will take a little time to set,
but not too long. Try not to move.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.550
I'll be right back.

13:33.720 --> 13:38.510
Officer, he walked in,
and I was so scared, I had to shoot him.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.590
Six times.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.950
I know you're still mad...

13:42.120 --> 13:47.513
I'm way past mad. They'll have to find
a new word for what I'm feeling.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.878
Look, I put all my hopes
into a grant that fell through.

13:52.040 --> 13:56.397
I'm so close, but with no grant,
my work goes up in smoke.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.358
I didn't even know there was a problem.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.795
You want me at your beck and call.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.315
I need someone I can depend on.

14:04.480 --> 14:07.790
- You're too sensitive.
- You know my past.

14:07.960 --> 14:11.919
Your father left when you were 1 1,
your mother's an alcoholic...

14:12.080 --> 14:16.790
What about my brother?
He only shows up when he needs money.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.158
I work 20 hours a day.
I'm working till I'm exhausted.

14:21.240 --> 14:23.800
You're too high maintenance.

14:23.960 --> 14:28.829
High maintenance?
Maybe we should explore other options.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.388
You mean do-anything-for-sex Jerry?

14:32.560 --> 14:34.278
I don't know who I mean.

14:34.440 --> 14:38.069
At least Jerry's around to be my friend.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.149
DOOR CLOSING

14:39.240 --> 14:41.231
Dipshit!

14:48.120 --> 14:49.712
What a day.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.156
- Good evening.
- Who's there!

14:54.320 --> 14:58.154
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I won't harm you.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.959
- You were at the party.
- Yes.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.033
- How'd you get in?
- Your landlady. Sweet woman.

15:05.120 --> 15:10.433
I told her that I was your uncle
and had arrived earlier than expected.

15:10.520 --> 15:15.833
It's one of the benefits of being like this.
People trust you.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.115
You don't seem to, though.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.635
Stay right where you are!

15:20.720 --> 15:22.870
You have nothing to fear.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.673
In fact, you have everything to gain.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.473
Put down that bat so we can talk.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.639
Not until you answer
a few of my questions. First...

15:33.720 --> 15:36.678
Why are you here? And second...

15:36.840 --> 15:39.070
How did you know my name last night?

15:39.200 --> 15:42.272
I'll answer your questions in time.

15:42.440 --> 15:43.998
In time.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.038
Now, we don't want to be late, do we?

15:47.120 --> 15:49.270
- Late for what?
- Dinner.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.919
You think I'll go?

15:52.520 --> 15:53.919
Actually, yes.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.472
You look like a virgin on your first date.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.431
I hope you'll be gentle.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.078
Not on your life!

16:10.200 --> 16:13.192
If you're who I think you are,
nor will you.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.035
If we come to terms,
you'll find it rewarding.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.395
What are you talking about?

16:20.200 --> 16:23.829
Relax.
I promise this'll be worth your while.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.309
At least you'll eat well.

16:38.320 --> 16:44.509
You're prepared to give your entire
estate, millions, away to a total stranger.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.712
It's my way of living on past my time.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.839
What's the catch?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.230
Ah...

16:52.320 --> 16:54.231
The catch.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.197
There's always a catch.

16:57.920 --> 17:03.711
The only stipulation is that upon my
death, you will assume my full identity,

17:03.880 --> 17:07.429
and continue your
research under my name.

17:07.520 --> 17:11.593
You may not tell anyone
the terms of the agreement.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.711
Have you any questions?

17:15.720 --> 17:19.872
This is all so strange.
I don't know where to begin.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.833
Well, why not begin at the beginning?

17:25.119 --> 17:27.873
I am... Everett Longstreet.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.190
The Everett Longstreet?

17:31.360 --> 17:34.397
How many people have a name like that?

17:34.560 --> 17:37.950
The Nobel Prize-winner
for genetic engineering?

17:38.120 --> 17:41.157
I did share the prize with a colleague.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.439
I'm sorry. This is such a shock.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.273
A wonderful shock, but still a shock.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.193
I'm just a sick man in a wheelchair.

17:52.360 --> 17:56.990
Your work on the Maskai Shamans
from the '30s sparked my research.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.434
Yes, I know.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.556
You know a lot about me.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.559
A man of my wealth
has intriguing connections.

18:07.280 --> 18:13.833
For years, I've tried to find someone with
the obsession, drive, self-determination...

18:13.920 --> 18:17.276
who'd sacrifice everything for greatness.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.669
Someone like myself.

18:19.840 --> 18:23.833
So, I began finding out
everything I could about you.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.471
That make you uncomfortable?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.673
Come.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.149
I'll show you a bit of my past.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.993
We've spent our lives
asking the same questions,

18:44.080 --> 18:47.038
if not looking for the same answers.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.872
Collective thought.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.635
The next step
in man's pursuit of immortality.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.712
When I was young,
I experimented with herbs,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.712
and magic potions of the Maskai.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.032
I made some progress,
but lacked the funds to continue,

19:04.120 --> 19:07.192
so I had to move on to other work.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.754
Sounds like my situation now.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.269
It was such a waste.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.750
But now I'm in a position
to change it for you.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.438
Well...

19:24.520 --> 19:29.514
Lacking funds is something I do well.
Too well.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.513
This could be an opportunity
that so few people get.

19:33.600 --> 19:39.516
The wisdom of age and the energy
of youth are so very rarely combined.

19:48.120 --> 19:52.432
So far, I've been able to locate
memory neural transmitters,

19:52.520 --> 19:55.034
and map them into the neural net.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.157
But it's fragmented, incomplete.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.595
I can't keep the network intact.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.548
I can stimulate memory,
but only for brief intervals.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.830
What do you think is missing?

20:08.440 --> 20:11.557
Well, this is gonna sound crazy, but...

20:11.680 --> 20:17.710
I know I can conform conscious
and unconscious thought into the matrix.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.997
But the most important element...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.754
I'm not sure I can reach the soul.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.431
Now...

20:27.520 --> 20:32.833
Let me show you something the Maskai
Shamans knew about your soul.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.678
Would you move the bowl over here?

21:28.840 --> 21:30.956
HISSING

21:37.360 --> 21:39.078
Inhale.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.197
Take in the smoke.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.112
Let it wash over you like a velvet hand.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.109
I... don't feel anything.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.519
That stinks.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.311
Come on over here.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.911
Take off the cover.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.109
Do you play?

22:20.720 --> 22:22.995
Chopsticks. Badly.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.878
Sit down. Try it.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.713
Go on.

# CHOPSTICKS

22:48.520 --> 22:50.511
MOZART: Rondo alla turca

23:32.920 --> 23:35.275
My mother made me study piano.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.433
I hated it.
But now I love Mozart like I love my life.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.512
It was good to hear myself play again.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.511
It was remarkable.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.636
It was like being you!

23:49.720 --> 23:53.110
Not just seeing your memory,
but being you!

23:53.240 --> 23:55.470
I do have a certain style.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.912
I mean, I've never had any musical...
talents at all.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.118
It was amazing
to feel my fingers evoke such beauty.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.840
It's a Shaman sideshow trick,

24:06.920 --> 24:11.436
but it involves principles
at the heart of collective thought.

24:11.560 --> 24:17.157
This equipment was to distil the science
behind the Shaman's potions,

24:17.240 --> 24:20.118
but I never could get the answer.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.914
But I'm betting that you can.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.591
HEARTBEAT

25:36.760 --> 25:38.751
What the...?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.512
Oh, I need sleep.

25:41.680 --> 25:44.319
That's all. I need sleep, bad.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.311
(YAWNS)

26:29.520 --> 26:31.511

27:49.040 --> 27:51.031
HEARTBEAT

28:01.600 --> 28:06.720
I've scheduled a medical exam
in order for you to undergo a few tests.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.080
I can't think of a thing wrong with me.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.117
Do you sleep well?

28:31.280 --> 28:34.317
Yeah. I do have dreams, though.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.277
Dark dreams.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.875
Maybe we should test some more,
to find the cause.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.429
No. No more testing.

28:43.520 --> 28:46.671
I'm sure they're caused
by the work I'm doing.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.511
KNOCKING

28:56.880 --> 28:57.869
Hi.

29:02.520 --> 29:06.911
That was quite a trial.
Mind telling me what that was about?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.470
I apologise for any discomfort.

29:10.600 --> 29:15.310
It was to see if you're healthy
before I sign everything over.

29:15.480 --> 29:21.715
It's worth it. On paper, you'll become me
and I'm tired of being sick.

29:21.880 --> 29:26.431
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna go home and get some sleep.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.551
But you are home.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.239
How's that?

29:30.920 --> 29:35.436
I took the liberty of having
your things brought here.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.795
Your room is next to the lab.

29:38.520 --> 29:39.635
OK.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.033
Do me a favour - no more surprises.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.236
I've had as many as I can take.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.719
Sorry.
I become over-zealous when I'm excited.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.991
It's a trait
that my wife found unbearable.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.230
Your wife?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.515
You said you have no family.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.431
I haven't.

30:02.560 --> 30:06.758
She left...
what seems like two lifetimes ago.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.031
- Do you keep in touch?
- She died.

30:10.120 --> 30:13.635
We have more important things
to talk about.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.915
Good night, Edward.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.312
Good night.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.629
Duncan...

30:29.720 --> 30:32.712
What do you know
about Everett Longstreet?

30:32.800 --> 30:38.989
Other than he's one of the most
brilliant men of modern history, not much.

30:39.160 --> 30:41.720
I'm talking personally.

30:43.720 --> 30:48.191
I can only tell you what I hear.
I hear he's very reclusive.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.794
He's on the Board, but stays away.

30:50.920 --> 30:53.878
I wouldn't speculate on his character.
Why?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.831
I'll explain.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.109
Eventually... Maybe.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.835
Is he why you're packing up
your equipment?

31:02.920 --> 31:06.629
Let's just say
I'm moving to a new location.

31:06.720 --> 31:08.392
- Where?
- I can't say.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.471
At least give me an address,

31:10.560 --> 31:15.714
so I can report you when I find out
how much of this is university property.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.552
You're an old fart.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.950
Here, pull my finger.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.793
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna miss you, Duncan.

31:22.960 --> 31:28.637
Don't sicken me. I had a spicy lunch
and I'd like it to stay where it is.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.917
Edward...

31:36.040 --> 31:38.315
Take care, OK? Please.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.112
Travis Mitchell

32:01.200 --> 32:05.830
Serial killer, killed by police
during an attempted murder.

32:05.920 --> 32:10.835
Clinical sociopath. Images seem to be
embedded in my memory.

32:10.920 --> 32:16.313
Subject's thoughts are vivid
and seem persistent, perhaps permanent.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.708
I saw it all -
the maze, the food, everything!

33:29.440 --> 33:32.034
Not only see it, I could feel it.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.509
I could feel his fear, frustration,

33:34.600 --> 33:38.229
his determination to find food once I...

33:40.080 --> 33:42.310
once he smelled it.

33:42.480 --> 33:45.040
You've got to get better cheese.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.679
Ow!

34:04.000 --> 34:07.754
Fuck. What did I do?

34:07.880 --> 34:10.792
You've been working very long hours.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.036
Perhaps you should rest.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.714
I still have some work to do.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.109
Maybe I'll just take a nap.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.156
Edward.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.790
Excellent work. I'm proud of you.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.717
Thank you.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.478
Don't walk away.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.119
I... I wasn't.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.840
Why can't we talk?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.230
Who are you?

36:08.320 --> 36:10.595
We spoke of having children.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.228
When was that supposed to happen?

36:13.320 --> 36:17.836
You don't have time for a child.
You don't have time for me.

36:17.920 --> 36:19.353
What do you mean?

36:19.480 --> 36:23.758
Of course,
I understand that your work is important.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.718
That is all you ever talk about.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.712
You're obsessed with this one thing!

36:32.040 --> 36:35.919
I love you, Everett,
but you give me no choice.

36:36.000 --> 36:36.989
Everett?

36:45.720 --> 36:49.395
You're going to do it.
You're not gonna stop me.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.193
I wish I had never met you.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.396
Do you hear what I say?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.551
I hate you!

37:00.360 --> 37:02.430
Wait.

37:02.520 --> 37:05.717
No, wait, please! I have to talk to you!

37:16.000 --> 37:18.195
What's happening to me?

37:20.240 --> 37:22.231
Am I losing my mind?

beneficiary of the Longstreet estate.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.678
- Did you hear me?
- What?

38:12.760 --> 38:17.038
Edward, you're rich.
You can pursue your work.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.714
Don't be an asshole. Enjoy it.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.512
It's not that.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.270
I don't know where the work ends...

38:31.440 --> 38:33.431
and I begin.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.431
(CLEARS THROAT)

38:45.520 --> 38:46.714
Hi.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.435
Hi.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.309
Oh, excuse me.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.671
Britt Clark, Everett Longstreet.

38:55.800 --> 38:59.236
What a pleasure to meet
such a beautiful woman.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.351
Thank you.

39:01.920 --> 39:05.435
This is... some place you got here.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.080
It's, uh... eclectic.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.475
So, Britt, uh...

39:10.600 --> 39:12.591
What are you doing here?

39:14.720 --> 39:19.840
I'm uncomfortable discussing this.
Is there another place to talk?

39:20.000 --> 39:22.753
There must be other rooms here.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.239
Yeah.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.550
I'm gonna work in my room.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.711
Oh, yes, of course.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.509
It's a pleasure to meet you.

39:47.320 --> 39:50.437
What do you think
of my new surroundings?

39:50.520 --> 39:53.512
It's big, old, musty. All we need is Igor.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.756
I thought we broke up.

39:55.880 --> 39:59.395
- You're here for...
- I needed a lobotomy.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.909
No, I was worried about you.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.640
What's really going on here?

40:08.720 --> 40:14.431
I have the chance to go after my dreams,
with all the funding I need.

40:14.600 --> 40:17.034
It'll make life so much easier,

40:17.160 --> 40:21.438
and I want to find a place for you in it,
and for me in yours.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.036
Well, that last line was pretty cheesy.

40:27.200 --> 40:31.273
I really want things to work out,
so I'll accept it.

40:31.400 --> 40:35.154
- I'm not happy without you.
- That's cheesy, too.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.108
OK, I accept your apology.
What time is it?

40:43.280 --> 40:45.669
Well, let's see.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.638
The big hand is on six,
the little's on eight.

45:21.960 --> 45:26.954
You were onto something with your work
on transference of thought.

45:27.080 --> 45:32.313
From what I see, the smoke stimulates
production of neural transmitters,

45:32.400 --> 45:34.356
then vaporises them.

45:34.520 --> 45:37.478
Inhaled,
it binds with post-synaptic neurons,

45:37.640 --> 45:40.996
transferring memory - collective thought.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.111
So much for theory.

45:44.520 --> 45:46.750
How do you bring it to life?

45:46.880 --> 45:52.955
Well, what I'm attempting to do
is analyse their chemical structure,

45:53.040 --> 45:55.838
code them, input them into the computer.

45:55.920 --> 46:01.517
If it works, we'll be able to store,
transfer and filter my memory, thoughts...

46:01.640 --> 46:03.232
even my soul.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.629
I placed my bet well with you.

46:05.720 --> 46:06.914
If it works.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.319

Let's give it a shot.

Everett!

47:32.520 --> 47:34.511
Why?

49:09.520 --> 49:11.511
What's happening?

What's wrong with me? I must be...

(WHISPERS) No.

49:36.920 --> 49:38.911
This can't be happening.

49:40.920 --> 49:43.912
Longstreet, what have you done to me?

50:01.040 --> 50:04.237
Edward,
thanks for the new lease on life.

50:19.560 --> 50:22.313
You took my body and erased everything!

50:22.920 --> 50:25.912
How did you do it without me knowing?

50:28.040 --> 50:30.998
My chest. Can't breathe.

She was his wife.

51:15.360 --> 51:17.954
Yes, I... need some help.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.429
I... think I'm having a heart attack.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.750
"Sir, what's your address? "

51:22.920 --> 51:25.559
Yes, I'm at... 6...

51:25.640 --> 51:26.914
Ackerman... Lane.

51:27.000 --> 51:30.515
It's the... Longstreet residence.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.318
"Sir, what's your name? "

51:32.400 --> 51:33.913
Edward...

51:38.000 --> 51:41.436
"Stay on the line.
An ambulance is on its way."

51:41.520 --> 51:42.919
"Sir? "

51:43.000 --> 51:44.592
"Sir, are you there? "

51:48.520 --> 51:50.829
I found a buyer for three pieces,

51:50.920 --> 51:54.469
and another guy loves
the one with the corset.

52:00.000 --> 52:00.989
You OK?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.235
Oh...

52:04.320 --> 52:06.311
Sort of.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.879
Yeah.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.838
Look...

52:13.920 --> 52:15.558
Britt...

52:15.640 --> 52:18.473
Am I really just wasting my time here?

52:18.600 --> 52:21.034
Oh, no, no.

52:21.120 --> 52:25.557
You're not wasting your time,
not in the real sense of the word.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.279
You know
when two people just don't...

52:28.400 --> 52:30.834
- I don't wanna...
- Any time now.

52:30.960 --> 52:35.556
I like you. I'm flattered.
I just think of you as a friend.

52:35.680 --> 52:37.159
Ah!

52:37.240 --> 52:39.515
No.

52:39.600 --> 52:42.478
- Not the F word.
- The F word?

52:42.600 --> 52:45.194
Friend. Just don't say it.

52:45.320 --> 52:47.072
OK.

52:47.200 --> 52:50.317
I'm gonna take one last stab at this.

52:51.440 --> 52:55.831
Why do you want to be with a guy
who has no money, no prospects,

52:55.920 --> 52:58.832
nothing but a head full of idealistic crap,

52:58.920 --> 53:01.912
who you know will screw up your life?

53:02.000 --> 53:05.310
I know. I know. I'm crazy. I know.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.834
How cosy.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.951
Speak of the devil.

53:18.520 --> 53:19.714
Edward?

53:20.920 --> 53:22.717
Get the fuck out of here.

53:22.880 --> 53:24.393
Take it easy.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.757
I said get the fuck out of here!

53:27.840 --> 53:29.637
Are you OK?

53:29.800 --> 53:32.234
What's wrong with you?

53:32.320 --> 53:34.311
I... I don't know.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.151
I didn't mean to hit him.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.436
I don't know why I did that.

53:39.520 --> 53:43.593
I misjudged you.
I didn't think you had the balls.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.236
There's your decision.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.311
That's what you want?

Hello!

54:21.720 --> 54:23.711
Anybody here?

54:25.920 --> 54:27.911
Paramedics.

54:28.920 --> 54:31.639
This could be our eighth DOA this week.

54:31.800 --> 54:37.113
That would top the all-time record.
This could be our shot at immortality.

54:39.560 --> 54:43.075
Leon! I got the coronary in here.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.639
Is it the record?

54:47.720 --> 54:49.711
He doesn't look chipper.

54:49.880 --> 54:51.871
Bad news - there's a pulse.

54:52.000 --> 54:55.595
Alright, let's prepare him for transport.

54:56.080 --> 54:59.709
He looks bad.
I'll never eat beef jerky again.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.478
Will he make it to General?

55:01.600 --> 55:05.673
- Bet he won't get to Fifth and Flower.
- Main and Ninth.

55:05.800 --> 55:06.789
You're on.

55:19.320 --> 55:20.594
I overreacted.

55:20.760 --> 55:23.035
I didn't mean to hit him.

55:24.520 --> 55:26.715
It's not me.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.791
You scared me.

55:32.600 --> 55:33.828
Come on.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.831
I wanna show you something.

55:35.920 --> 55:37.717
Come on.

55:39.280 --> 55:41.748
- On the roof?
- Mm-hm.

55:41.920 --> 55:45.310
I wanna give you something. Come on.

55:56.320 --> 55:57.514
This is your gift.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.349
Where?

56:00.480 --> 56:02.038
You're standing on it.

56:05.120 --> 56:06.473
You bought me a roof?

56:06.600 --> 56:08.318
No.

56:09.920 --> 56:12.673
I bought you the whole building.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.955
OK, let me get this straight.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.709
Longstreet left me his estate.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.034
He died?

56:41.160 --> 56:43.310
This morning.

56:43.400 --> 56:47.109
He had a heart attack.
He left me everything.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.598
You don't seem affected.

56:51.720 --> 56:54.280
He was old. It was his time.

56:56.200 --> 56:59.112
- Now, it's my time.
- Why you?

57:00.520 --> 57:03.193
He had his reasons. Only he knew.

57:03.760 --> 57:04.749
I have my reasons.

57:07.560 --> 57:11.633

Move him to J ward.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.434
He had a heart attack symptons,

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.036
but we found it was induced
by an overdose of potassium chloride.

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.318

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.037
He has a history of mental instability.

Are you enjoying
the twisted mind of Travis Mitchell?

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:39.357
Why? Why would you pollute
your memory with someone so -

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.238
It was an early experiment.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:45.188
I tapped into his mind
without realising that

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:49.148
it would embed his memory into mine.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.957
Now, your memory.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.111
Permanently.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.077
Why did you do this to me?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.151
I wanted life.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:08:59.151
I wanted more life.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.072
I'd do anything for it.

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:08.236
Potassium chloride is a crude way of
trying to induce an artificial heart attack.

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:12.871
You should have tried Tramiacin 1 5.
It leaves fewer traces.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.828
Edward, any advancement,
like true life extension,

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:21.835
will be taken over and perverted
by the wealthy and powerful.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.234
It's the history of science.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:27.437
The one thing I can
thank you for teaching me

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.799
is that it's not important
how long you live, but how well you live.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:37.430
Both of us have lived our lives,
wasted our lives,

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.876
chasing eternity and failing to live,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.270
to enjoy the thing that we covet so much.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:49.639
Sounds like the point of view of
a man lying in bed dying, doesn't it?

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.233
Not my point of view.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:55.472
I didn't expect to hear it
from a mind like yours.

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.239
Edward, I need you to reprocess me,

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.756
and filter Travis Mitchell out of my soul.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.635
Something about the chemical make-up
of the diseased mind

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.032
makes it want to eat away
at the healthy part of the mind.

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.998
It will eat away at you,
till you don't exist.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.070
Why should I help you?

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.236
Because I have Britt,

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.153
and if you don't, I will kill her.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.470
You know how well I can kill.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.635
Besides, Edward,
you don't have much time to live.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.919
Don't make that true for her, too.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.273
I've reconnected the flow sensor.

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.958
What's the flow cycle?

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.911
What's going on, here?

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:56.639
Remember, I said I was trying to digitise
my memory and store it in a computer?

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.876
Shut up! What's the flow cycle?

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.758
6.4 per single wavelength cycle.

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.150
But you're Longstreet.
Edward told me that.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.919
Shut up! I'll kill you both now!

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.553
Oh, God.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.514
- What's next?
- Set it at maximum, wide open.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.478
It's done.

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.590
- Will it work?
- I don't know.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.036
You're pushing beyond
the limits of my ability.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:42.233
Make it happen,
or I'll blow your brains out!

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:45.710
I've been watching you,
so don't try anything.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.919
What's your code?

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.512
Oh...

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.876
In case you think about stopping this...

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.389
Edward!

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:18.476
You can stop the system.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:22.388
Pull the fuse,
then look under the glass table.

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:24.551
There's an envelope.

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.233

"Please!"

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:44.716
Britt, in the event of some
gross miscalculation on my part,

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.349
I've stored my digitised memory
on this disk.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.991
ECHOING: "I was worried about you."

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.278
"I'm not happy without you."

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.597
"I want things to work out between us."

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:01.036
"I want things to work out between us."

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.437
Oh, Edward!

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.109
(PANTING) Yeah, it's me.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.599
Prove it.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.835
Your father left when you were 1 1.
Your mother's an alcoholic.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.911
What about my brother?

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.029
You know,
I don't think I'll ever be the same.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.230
What do you mean?

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.351
Because I know...

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.915
the horror that Longstreet felt.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.708
The desperation... of growing old...

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.671
Iosing hope.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.993
It was the desperation of staying alive.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.071
I love you.
