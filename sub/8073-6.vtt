[theme music]

00:09.677 --> 00:11.112
What's that?

00:11.145 --> 00:13.181
Dead guy.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.249
Nancy, this is an
eating establishment.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.317
Are you crazy?

00:16.350 --> 00:20.121
You can't tie up a
whole table for four.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.989
He doesn't look very realistic.

00:22.022 --> 00:26.294
Next year, I'm springing
for a real dead guy.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.963
Well, he looks pretty
good to me, Roseanne.

00:29.997 --> 00:32.066
He looks like he
died in his sleep.

00:32.100 --> 00:32.900
Give me that knife.

00:43.711 --> 00:49.183
Yes, here at the Lunch Box,
the customer is always right.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.084
Hey, wait.

00:50.118 --> 00:50.918
You're not Leon.

00:53.354 --> 00:58.025
Well, spiders, blood, corpses.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.862
You know, charmed as I am
by all your accouterments,

01:01.895 --> 01:06.134
I still feel the need to
remove the fake vomit.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.102
Oh, it's wet!

01:08.136 --> 01:10.538
Well, that plastic
stuff never fools anybody.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.839
You mean, this is-- this is--

01:11.872 --> 01:13.141
No!

01:13.174 --> 01:16.377
We just doctored up
some of the loose meat.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.279
What did you do to it
to make it look like that?

01:18.312 --> 01:19.180
Surprisingly little.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.752
Have you decided what you're
wearing to Dan's lodge party?

01:24.785 --> 01:26.220
Well, we were
thinking that you and me

01:26.254 --> 01:28.122
and Dan and Roseanne would
all go as the Cleaver family.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.022
Oh, yeah.

01:29.056 --> 01:29.990
Look at this.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.192
I'm Beaver Cleaver.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.062
And Dan gets to
be June Cleaver.

01:35.095 --> 01:35.963
And you can be Ward.

01:35.996 --> 01:37.165
And I get to be Wally.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.299
I don't know, you guys.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.067
I kind of already had
something else in mind.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.068
Oh, my god.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.670
You're not gonna
shave your head and go

01:42.703 --> 01:45.406
as that stop the insanity
woman again, are you?

01:45.439 --> 01:46.840
No.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.676
But I don't think I should
spend the whole evening

01:48.709 --> 01:49.843
with you guys.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.812
I don't think Dan
would have a good time.

01:51.845 --> 01:55.015
What are you talking about?

01:55.048 --> 01:57.084
I don't think Dan
likes me very much.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.120
Well, of course he does.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.889
Look, I'm very
sensitive to these things.

02:01.922 --> 02:04.858
I know when someone
doesn't like me.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.093
Does it look
something like this?

02:15.169 --> 02:17.205
When I tell Dan
that you said that,

02:17.238 --> 02:19.740
he is going to come over here
and set everything straight.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.709
He's gonna hug you so
hard that you're gonna

02:21.742 --> 02:25.846
be leaking silicone for days.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.715
Then you think he
really does like me?

02:27.748 --> 02:28.916
Yes, already.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.418
Everybody likes you.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.153
God, you're so annoying.

Lunch Box.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.795
Oh, hi, Darlene.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.599
Hey, if this is about you not
coming home for Halloween,

02:45.633 --> 02:48.068
you better have a
damn good excuse.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.371
Well, I was in a horrible
accident, and I'm just a head.

02:55.042 --> 02:55.843
And?

02:58.546 --> 02:59.980
Something came up.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.850
There's this
Halloween party here.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.786
The thing is, this guy
asked me to go with him.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.921
And I'm thinking about going.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.391
This isn't like a
date or nothing, is it?

03:10.424 --> 03:11.559
No, it's no big deal.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.561
Just please don't tell David.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.596
Well, gee, I don't know.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.697
Come on, it'll--

03:16.730 --> 03:19.767
it'll be like our
little secret, OK?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.668
OK, fine.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.735
I'll do this for you.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.404
But you remember this
when I'm about 80

03:23.437 --> 03:27.040
and I need help getting
your dad into his truss.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.842
Hey, Mom?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.077
Thanks for being there.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.880
Yeah, well, it was my shift.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.781
DARLENE: OK, bye.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.615
Bye.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.819
I cannot believe what
Darlene just told.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.054
Me she's cheating on David.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.189
I never thought
this would happen.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.591
We're like girlfriends!

03:46.294 --> 03:49.162
Well, at least
the waiting is over.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.765
I survived my annual
Roseanne prank.

03:51.799 --> 03:56.337
Can you imagine the shock when
I sat down at my desk only

03:56.370 --> 04:01.542
to discover, ooh, oogie,
boogie, woogie, boogie, boogie.

04:01.575 --> 04:06.547
Frankly, Roseanne,
I'm disappointed.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.950
[theme music]

05:01.234 --> 05:02.770
What's that?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.506
Oh, that's my
pranks, dirty tricks,

05:05.539 --> 05:09.777
from flat out mean stuff I plan
to do to my loved ones list.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.646
Let's see-- David, David, David.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.182
Aha.

05:15.215 --> 05:19.453
Well, you may want to
wear a helmet to bed.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.788
Have you figured out
what your costume's

05:20.821 --> 05:22.723
gonna be for the lodge party?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.124
I'm not going.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.259
I mean, if Darlene were gonna
be here, I'd give it a try.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.228
But she called and said
that she has to study

05:28.261 --> 05:30.398
for a test on Halloween night.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.399
Well, yeah.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.766
Well, you know,
that's school for you.

05:32.800 --> 05:38.138
It's either a test
or something else.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.239
So I'm not gonna do anything.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.410
Oh, but David, you
can't not do anything.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.611
This is Halloween.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.878
It's the one night a year
where you're supposed

05:44.912 --> 05:45.913
to break all the rules.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.748
And you're a Conner now.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.150
I just cannot allow you
to sit here at home and be

05:50.183 --> 05:52.052
good and nice and well-behaved.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.855
People will begin to talk.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.725
DAN: Hey, honey, I'm home.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.692
Ah!

05:58.726 --> 06:00.193
Oh!

06:00.227 --> 06:02.663
I told you to get
salted crackers!

06:02.696 --> 06:05.633
I'll be outside.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.602
Oh!

06:08.636 --> 06:11.038
Well, what have we here, my pet?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.205
Your little prank list?

06:12.239 --> 06:14.508
Yes, but you
shall never see it!

06:14.542 --> 06:16.577
I'm putting it in the vault.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.578
I'm coming in after it.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.516
Give me!

06:22.550 --> 06:23.350
Give me!

06:26.920 --> 06:27.888
Dan?

06:27.921 --> 06:30.858
Yes.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.392
You should have been
at the diner today.

06:32.426 --> 06:33.994
The weirdest thing happened.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.996
Like right out of
the blue, Nancy

06:36.029 --> 06:37.264
comes up with this
thing where she

06:37.297 --> 06:38.298
thinks that you don't like her.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.341
You do so!

06:48.375 --> 06:49.543
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.945
She's the most superficial
person I've ever met.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.747
But that's just her facade.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.115
She's rude and selfish.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.249
I know.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.753
But inside, she's just
a scared little girl.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.522
Yeah, I know
who's scaring her.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.256
The raging bitch on the outside.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.695
That is no fair, Dan!

07:07.728 --> 07:10.531
You know all your dumb, stupid,
idiot friends that I hate?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.066
I like them.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.769
Hey, Roseanne, I
pretend to like Nancy.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.606
Well, then, you suck at
it because she's onto you.

07:18.639 --> 07:21.575
Nancy's aware of other people?

07:21.609 --> 07:23.376
You're gonna go in
there, tomorrow, Dan,

07:23.410 --> 07:25.078
and you're gonna tell
her that you like her.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.448
And then you're gonna give
her a great, big, old hug.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.717
Well, then I'd
just have to come

07:29.750 --> 07:31.218
home and peel off all my skin.

07:33.521 --> 07:34.622
I'm serious, Dan.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.524
You've got to do it, or
else it's gonna be two

07:36.557 --> 07:38.859
hugs and a nice little poem.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.260
No, Roseanne.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.195
I'm not gonna tell her I like
her because I don't like her.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.263
Well, I know.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.832
But that's why you
have to go down there

07:44.865 --> 07:46.366
and tell her that you like her.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.301
You never tell people that
you like that you like 'em.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.937
The only people that you
ever tell that you like

07:49.970 --> 07:51.505
are the people that you
actually don't like.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.545
OK, I'll do it.

07:57.578 --> 07:58.912
Really?

07:58.946 --> 08:00.681
Course not.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.249
The only things you have
to say you're gonna do

08:02.282 --> 08:03.717
are the things you have
no intention of doing.

08:06.654 --> 08:09.456
[music playing]

08:13.493 --> 08:14.795
So what did Dan
think about all

08:14.828 --> 08:16.296
of us going as the
Cleaver family?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.265
Oh, he thought
it was really cool.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.668
And he thought of a way to
make it way funnier, too.

08:20.701 --> 08:24.304
It seems as though June,
OK, is so mangled that it's

08:24.337 --> 08:26.674
going to take Ward,
Wally, and the Beaver

08:26.707 --> 08:30.377
to carry what's left of
her around in a Mason jar.

08:30.410 --> 08:31.645
But wait a minute.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.213
If Dan is going as
June, that means

08:33.246 --> 08:34.782
he's not part of the group.

08:34.815 --> 08:35.683
I was right.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.150
He hates me.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.887
No, that's not true, Nance.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.521
No, he likes you, Nancy.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.323
It's just, you
know, he-- he's not

08:43.356 --> 08:45.793
that comfortable in high heels.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.696
Look, if the two of you can't
be honest with me about it,

08:48.729 --> 08:51.231
maybe you don't like me, either.

08:51.264 --> 08:52.532
No, we like you, Nancy.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.335
I mean-- I mean,
maybe not right now.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.870
But, you know, other times.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.438
Well, if you
hate so much, maybe

08:58.471 --> 09:00.007
I shouldn't work here anymore.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.474
Leon's been wanting
to buy my share.

09:01.508 --> 09:02.309
Maybe I should just sell.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.649
Gotcha.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.383
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

09:10.417 --> 09:13.153
The whole thing's
a prank me and sis

09:13.186 --> 09:17.457
here worked up to make you think
that us and Dan don't like you.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.960
Ha, ha.

09:19.993 --> 09:20.794
Boo!

09:25.265 --> 09:28.035
So Dan does like me and he's
gonna come here and hug me?

09:28.068 --> 09:31.004
Oh, well, I mean,
he, he-- he wants to.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.807
But I'm just too jealous
to let him, you know?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.075
So instead, he's
gonna pull, like,

09:35.108 --> 09:36.910
this great, all-time
prank on you.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.245
On me?
Really?

09:38.278 --> 09:39.412
Oh-- oh, yeah.
Huge.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.615
It's gonna be huge.
Really embarrassing, too.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.416
Feel better?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.118
I'm so touched.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.920
I could cry.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.821
Back in a sec.

09:47.855 --> 09:51.124
I love to watch myself cry.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.593
Is Dan playing
a trick on Nancy?

09:53.627 --> 09:54.427
He is now.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.865
Hi, Mrs. Conner.

09:57.898 --> 09:58.766
Hi, Jackie.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.733
Hi, guys.

09:59.767 --> 10:00.701
Wow.

10:00.734 --> 10:03.837
Who's the skirt with David?

10:03.871 --> 10:04.672
Nice rack.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.211
Hello, David!

10:11.244 --> 10:13.146
Hello, David's little friend.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.247
This is Sally Knapp.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.949
She's on the Halloween
dance committee,

10:15.983 --> 10:18.318
and she asked me to
draw up some posters.

10:18.351 --> 10:22.923
So we came here, where you
are, to work because, uh--

10:22.956 --> 10:24.557
because that's what we're doing.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.392
Working.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.329
I knew you'd be here.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.433
Can we get some pop, please?

10:38.538 --> 10:40.373
Well, he says that
they're working.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.274
Oh, yeah.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.342
Right.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.977
Well, you've got to
feel really guilty.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.379
You're the one that told David
to do something for Halloween.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.416
I didn't know he
was gonna do her.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.685
You should have seen me.

10:51.719 --> 10:55.255
I looked so sad.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.324
I'm so excited
about Dan's prank.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.226
I can't wait to see
how I look surprised.

11:02.562 --> 11:03.997
[phone ringing]

11:04.031 --> 11:05.966
David, here's your drink.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.567
Here, Sally.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.938
Oh, sorry.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.205
Lunch Box.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.573
Hey, Mom.

11:13.606 --> 11:14.474
Oh.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.508
Hi, uh, caller.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.446
Who is it?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.849
Darlene.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.617
Uh, listen, I just made
a decision about something,

11:24.651 --> 11:27.955
and I wanted to talk to
somebody who'd understand.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.790
When I thought about going
out with that other guy,

11:29.823 --> 11:32.826
it made me realize
how much I love David.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.896
I would just feel too
guilty dating anybody else.

11:35.929 --> 11:36.764
Yeah, yeah.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.133
That guilt'll really eat you up.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.902
You know, Mom, I think
it's really cool the way

11:41.935 --> 11:44.204
we can talk to each other now.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.272
Well, yeah Good.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.940
I hope you remember
this for, you know,

11:46.974 --> 11:49.209
in case we ever get, like,
in a big fight or anything,

11:49.242 --> 11:50.778
you know?

11:50.811 --> 11:51.678
Do me a favor.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.014
Keep an eye on David.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.016
Make sure he's happy.

11:56.049 --> 11:56.917
Yeah, happy.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.818
OK.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.552
Sure.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.854
Will do.

12:00.888 --> 12:01.755
All right.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.424
Talk to you later.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.926
Well?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.694
Well, Darlene
says she's not gonna

12:07.727 --> 12:09.262
go out with this
other guy after all

12:09.296 --> 12:11.498
because she just realized
how much she loved David.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.532
Oh.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.167
And now David's
with another girl.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.602
And you're the one that
pushed him into it.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.205
Man, I'd-- I'd hate to be
in your shoes right now.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.479
You know, I hope your baby
doesn't grow really long

12:26.513 --> 12:27.915
fingernails because
sometimes they like

12:27.948 --> 12:31.151
to hang on on their way out.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.553
[music playing]

12:39.059 --> 12:41.628
Well, you know, Dan,
I've been thinking.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.531
And I got way too
mad last night.

12:44.564 --> 12:48.068
And I was, uh, really a pain.
And I'm sorry.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.102
And blah, blah, blah.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.471
Love, Roseanne.

12:51.504 --> 12:52.472
No way.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.241
Whatever you want,
I ain't doing it.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.210
Why, Dan, your
suspicion truly hurts me.

12:57.244 --> 13:00.047
And after I was so
nice to you, too.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.816
Gee, I wonder what you can
do to make it up to me?

13:02.850 --> 13:04.317
I know!

13:04.351 --> 13:07.454
You can play a prank on Nancy!

13:07.487 --> 13:10.690
God beat me to it.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.093
Dan, if you don't
play a prank on Nancy

13:13.126 --> 13:14.862
to show her that
we all like her,

13:14.895 --> 13:17.164
then she might sell her shares
in the restaurant to Leon,

13:17.197 --> 13:19.299
and then he would
be my boss again.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.835
And this affects me how?

13:21.869 --> 13:27.040
Maybe you forgot what I'm
like when I work for Leon.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.642
Don't care for that.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.111
[giggling]

13:31.144 --> 13:32.512
What the hell's that?

13:37.517 --> 13:39.019
Hey!

13:39.052 --> 13:41.321
You think you would at
least ask before you go

13:41.354 --> 13:42.655
getting into my cheese puffs!

13:42.689 --> 13:43.590
Maybe they were for dinner!

13:45.625 --> 13:46.693
Sorry.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.061
Do you want me to go
out and get some more?

13:48.095 --> 13:49.562
No, don't bother.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.165
I'll just have to make
chicken now or something.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.733
You done with your posters?

13:53.766 --> 13:54.701
Well, yeah.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.503
But now we're
working on costumes.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.005
See, we're going to
the Halloween dance

13:58.038 --> 14:00.440
together as Romeo and Juliet.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.474
Six months after the suicide.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.378
Do you want to stay for dinner?

14:05.412 --> 14:08.315
We're not having dinner.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.616
I think I'm just gonna go.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.019
Oh.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.120
Will you call me later?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.087
Yeah, promise.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.494
Gee, do you like her?

14:21.528 --> 14:24.697
Gee, do you have to cheat
on my daughter using my couch

14:24.731 --> 14:28.201
and my cheese puffs
as your wooing tools?

14:28.235 --> 14:29.869
I am not cheating on Darlene.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.371
Sally's a friend.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.373
You're the one who's making
me go out on Halloween.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.707
Yeah, but I didn't
know you were gonna

14:34.741 --> 14:36.643
go out as a horny teenager.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.644
I'm telling Darlene.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.611
You can't.

14:38.645 --> 14:39.980
Yeah.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.649
Hey, mothers report back about
cheating boyfriends, David.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.984
It's in the Bible.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.252
Try reading it.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.453
Come on.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.455
I'm just going to the
Halloween dance with her.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.490
Besides, Darlene bailed on me.

14:50.523 --> 14:54.394
Well, she had that test.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.828
All right, Mrs. Conner.
Fine.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.064
Go ahead and tell her.

14:57.097 --> 14:59.499
But if you do, I'll know
that you lied about me being

14:59.532 --> 15:01.268
a part of the family because
you would never screw

15:01.301 --> 15:04.037
over one of your own kids.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.038
DJ, come here!

15:08.375 --> 15:09.176
Excuse me.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.282
DJ, you know that girl in
your class that you hate

15:15.315 --> 15:17.150
and that you call the warthog?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.419
What did I ask her to do?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.389
To kiss me.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.623
And did she kiss you?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.025
Yes.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.928
And did I have any
reason at all for doing so?

15:28.962 --> 15:29.762
No.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.435
You can go play.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.105
So you were saying?

15:38.138 --> 15:40.873
[music playing]

15:45.245 --> 15:47.614
Hey, hey, did you do that
for Halloween? 'Cause

15:47.647 --> 15:48.448
that looks pretty good.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.121
Do what?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.856
Wear them glasses.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.126
Cut the crap, lady.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.260
All right.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.829
Everybody do as I say,
and you won't get hurt.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.697
Put your hands on your head.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.567
Oh, the great big
robber gonna scare

16:07.600 --> 16:12.039
me with his itty-bitty gun.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.207
I said put your hands
on your head, lady.

16:14.241 --> 16:18.511
I know, but you didn't
say baldy says first.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.213
I'm serious!

16:20.247 --> 16:21.914
And stop looking at my face.

16:21.948 --> 16:23.216
(SINGING) I'm
looking, I'm looking,

16:23.250 --> 16:25.752
I'm memorizing everything.

16:25.785 --> 16:26.819
Roseanne!

16:26.853 --> 16:29.322
What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

16:29.356 --> 16:30.657
I'm getting a
prank pulled on me.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.860
I'm being robbed
by Daddy Warbucks.

16:33.893 --> 16:34.927
Shut up.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.829
Everyone, give me your
money and jewelry.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.531
And you, open the register.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.467
OK, but there's not a
lot of money in there,

16:40.500 --> 16:43.670
so I guess I'll have to give
you the keys to my house, too.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.339
You know, it's 714
Delaware Street.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.674
Lady, this guy's serious.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.210
Oh, well, then I'd better
give him my weeding ring, too.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.386
Roseanne, that
really wasn't a prank!

16:59.419 --> 17:00.720
Oh, please.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.255
It reeks of Dan.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.423
Wrong!

17:03.456 --> 17:05.892
That's Dan's prank!
Show her, Sam.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.894
Is there really any
point in doing this now?

17:07.927 --> 17:13.433
I mean, I'm a little upset.

17:13.466 --> 17:14.634
Show her!

17:14.667 --> 17:18.338
Oh, my god.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.407
Something wrong with this meat.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.574
I think I'm gonna be sick.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.409
Oh.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.515
[screaming]

17:31.718 --> 17:32.585
Are you serious?

17:32.619 --> 17:33.653
Why didn't you tell me?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.655
I did!

17:35.688 --> 17:38.158
I gave him my wedding ring!

17:38.191 --> 17:39.259
Would you please
call the police,

17:39.292 --> 17:40.927
and I'll try to
see where he went?

17:40.960 --> 17:44.297
DAN: [laughing]

17:51.271 --> 17:55.608
Ha, ha, Stoopnagle.

17:55.642 --> 17:56.743
Not bad.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.644
Not bad?

17:57.677 --> 17:58.745
It was great.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.547
Yawn.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.249
See you at work, Dan.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.450
I got a delivery to make.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.417
Good one, Dan.

18:08.488 --> 18:11.958
Stoopnagle.

18:11.991 --> 18:17.364
So I hope you have Nancy's,
uh, prank all ready.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.265
Yeah, I do.

18:18.298 --> 18:19.166
Yeah?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.934
And I'm keeping it right here.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.536
That ain't no prank.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.972
Well, it fooled you, so
it's bound to mystify her.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.878
That's all she's
getting, Roseanne.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.147
I ain't gonna waste no
killer prank on Nancy.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.114
She's not worth it.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.318
I don't like her.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.253
Oh, man.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.488
Hey, Nancy, wait.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.389
You don't understand.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.691
NANCY: No, Dan!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.160
Oh, my god!

18:47.194 --> 18:51.130
Oh, oh.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.865
Oh, I get it!

18:52.899 --> 18:53.700
It's my prank!

18:56.503 --> 18:57.870
You should go
look at your face

18:57.904 --> 18:59.539
and see how surprised it looks.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.440
Go, go.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.808
Well, look, he's still going.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.376
You really do like me.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.477
And I like you, too!

19:04.511 --> 19:07.814
[screaming]

19:07.847 --> 19:13.453
Ew, I hope this
fake stuff washes off.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.723
Wow, you're funny, Dan.

19:16.756 --> 19:17.690
Come on!

19:17.724 --> 19:19.792
I'll take you to
the emergency room!

19:19.826 --> 19:22.562
[music playing]

19:23.830 --> 19:26.032
Man, I'm never going to the
hospital on Halloween again.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.334
Oh, come on, Dan.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.737
When else can you get your
nose set by a ninja turtle?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.505
You went too far
this time, Roseanne.

19:32.539 --> 19:33.806
You really embarrassed me.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.142
What's this?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.411
David brought that
girl over here again?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.146
Well, they're not
in the living room.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.381
She better not be
down in his room.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.549
Wait a minute.
- Man.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.017
Don't go down there
all crazy and everything.

19:45.051 --> 19:45.985
Surprise!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.787
Darlene, you're home!

19:47.820 --> 19:49.689
Darlene, we didn't know
you were coming home!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.358
Why are you guys
acting so weird?

19:51.391 --> 19:54.427
Did I interrupt some
sort of creepy sex thing?

19:54.461 --> 19:56.263
Uh, yes.
Come back tomorrow.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.267
Well, I just
came to see David.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.334
Is he downstairs?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.902
Oh, this is, uh, David.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.971
Uh, he's going as your dad.

20:05.004 --> 20:06.639
He's just trying to
get the nose right.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.011
David's with that Sally girl.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.112
What Sally girl?

20:13.145 --> 20:14.247
Uh, Sally girl.

20:14.281 --> 20:15.748
You know, that's, uh,
one of those new kids'

20:15.782 --> 20:17.450
expression for a guy's friend.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.751
You know, like homeboy.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.752
Yeah.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.854
Right now David's
downstairs hanging

20:21.888 --> 20:24.424
with, uh, his Sally girl Mike.

20:28.127 --> 20:28.995
No, he's not.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.563
Sally's his new girlfriend.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.065
They were kissing on the couch
for, like, a million hours.

20:33.099 --> 20:36.803
And then they were downstairs.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.906
Don't move.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.441
All right, young man.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.311
Who taught you to
tell the truth?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.245
[scream]

20:47.246 --> 20:48.381
Stop it!
You're hurting her!

20:48.415 --> 20:49.282
You whore!

20:49.316 --> 20:50.249
Darlene!

20:50.283 --> 20:51.217
Tramp!

20:51.250 --> 20:52.552
You slut!

20:52.585 --> 21:01.260
[screaming] Happy
Halloween, sucker!

21:06.699 --> 21:09.135
Shut up, all of you!

21:09.168 --> 21:10.670
You scared the hell out of me.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.972
Pranks are supposed to be funny.

21:13.005 --> 21:13.873
I'm sorry, Mrs. Conner.

21:13.906 --> 21:14.907
It was my idea.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.376
I just wanted to be
part of the family.

21:19.312 --> 21:23.483
Oh, well, then I
guess I'm proud of you.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.684
Now give me that head!

21:24.717 --> 21:25.585
Come on.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.219
We'll go over to Jackie's.

21:27.253 --> 21:30.490
[music playing]
