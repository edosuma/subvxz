WEBVTT

00:02.536 --> 00:04.438
<i>Previously on</i> The Equalizer...

00:04.538 --> 00:06.307
I'm not too keen
on private citizens

00:06.407 --> 00:08.042
opening their own branch
of law enforcement.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.343
Come on, Marcus, imagine

00:09.443 --> 00:10.444
what we can accomplish

00:10.544 --> 00:12.880
<i>if we were on the same team.</i>

00:12.980 --> 00:14.315
<i>It's about Mel.</i>

00:14.415 --> 00:16.284
<i>She's been training Delilah
in self-defense.</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:17.918
Although I expressly
forbade it.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.354
<i>She used O-goshi
on a kid today.</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:22.290
<i>Damn near broke his arm.</i>

00:22.390 --> 00:23.691
She's not ready, Mel.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.060
I decide what is appropriate
for her to learn.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.328
Not you.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.829
One of the most
important things to learn

00:28.929 --> 00:31.232
with this skill
is when or when not

00:31.332 --> 00:33.434
to use it, but you'll get there.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.968
You're still gonna
let me train with her?

00:35.069 --> 00:36.837
There's no better teacher.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.440
<i>You're still upset with her</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:40.941
<i>about the training
behind your back.</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:42.876
It's more than that.
I've always kept

00:42.976 --> 00:44.678
my private and professional
lives separate.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.548
Walls are all down now,
and you don't like it.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.550
I don't know
how I feel about it.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.648
Hey, yo, uh, give me five.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.882
Yep.

01:28.122 --> 01:30.158
Randall.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.859
What are you doing here?

01:31.959 --> 01:32.993
Can't stop by
to see an old friend?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.462
You know the drill.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.829
I can't be seen
with nobody from our old crew.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.031
That's part of my
parole conditions.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.969
I do appreciate the way
you did your time like a man.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.771
They don't make 'em
like us anymore, Tim.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.006
These youngins
will snitch in a heartbeat.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.575
Why you here, Randall?
Straight to it.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.143
Always liked that about you.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.013
Something came my way.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.948
I need someone I can count on.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.085
Someone with serious
safe-cracking skills.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.156
Can't do it.

02:02.256 --> 02:04.792
Hey, man, I'm finally
getting my life together

02:04.892 --> 02:07.127
And I got no plans of
going back to prison.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.562
It's an easy job.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.164
Big-time money.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.865
Look, you won't have to...

02:11.965 --> 02:14.468
waste your time
in this place, man.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.404
It's honest work.

02:16.504 --> 02:19.407
So, sorry, Randall,
but I'm out.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.974
Nah, I'm sorry.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.177
For the confusion.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.879
I'm not asking.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.191
I'll send you a note.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.593
Let you know where to meet.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.271
Ah, thanks for
a great breakfast, Aunt Vi.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.539
Really appreciate it.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.674
My pleasure. Oh.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.210
Could you please
give this to Harry for me?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.645
Harry?

02:57.745 --> 03:00.314
Just a little thank-you
for a favor he did.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.082
What favor?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.585
Oh, no big deal.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.920
Ooh!

03:07.020 --> 03:10.258
Mel is taking it easy
on you, huh?

03:10.358 --> 03:12.660
No, it's not the work.
It's these 5:00 a.m. starts

03:12.760 --> 03:15.929
that are killing me.
Be careful what you wish for.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.632
There's no whining in whatever
you're Jeet Kune Do-ing.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.133
Cecil and Kat are
coming over for a rematch

03:20.234 --> 03:21.602
and I need you at your best.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.971
Hit the shower.

03:24.071 --> 03:25.406
Thank you.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.108
Spades with Kat and Cecil
again?

03:29.042 --> 03:31.979
You think they haven't come up
with a new way to cheat?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.282
I'm not worried.
They want more smoke, bring it.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.749
You sure you don't want me
to set up

03:35.849 --> 03:38.519
a surveillance camera
on Kat and Cecil's cards?

03:38.619 --> 03:39.620
I mean, to even
the playing field.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.522
No. Because the beatdown

03:41.622 --> 03:43.657
they're about to get
is gonna be criminal.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.527
I don't need evidence on that.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.297
TouchÃ©.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.098
Go ahead,
Aunt Vi.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.537
He's got me
in a bad spot.

03:56.637 --> 03:59.206
What was in the photo?

04:00.374 --> 04:02.310
My little brother, Shawn...

04:02.410 --> 04:04.612
with a gun to his head.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.015
He says if I don't
do this job, he'll kill him.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.617
Do you know
when Randall grabbed him?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.519
When's the last time
you saw your brother?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.521
Four years ago.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.524
It was at my trial.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.858
He never came
to see you in prison?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.860
Nah, I knew he was upset.

04:19.960 --> 04:23.030
It wasn't until months later
when I realized how much.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.498
Right.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.233
That's tough.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.502
Look, you got to understand.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.404
It was just us two.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.840
I mean, our parents died
in a car crash ten years ago.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.009
And I promised Shawn
I would never leave him.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.746
But then we needed
money for insulin.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.714
Among other things.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.817
And that's when I fell in
with Randall's crew.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.887
Look, when I got paroled,
I just wanted to show him

04:46.987 --> 04:48.956
that I had changed, you know?

04:49.056 --> 04:51.024
You know, that-that I had
cleaned up my act.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.060
But, I mean,
he won't talk to me.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.629
Maybe if he sees you've really
changed, he'll come around.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.764
Okay, but that's the thing,
is if I do

04:56.864 --> 04:58.198
what Randall's asking me,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.267
everything I worked for
goes down the drain.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.603
And you can't risk
going to the police

05:02.703 --> 05:04.372
because if Randall finds out...

05:04.472 --> 05:05.839
Yeah.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.411
When's this job going down?

05:11.879 --> 05:13.914
Tomorrow night.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.148
Why you?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.351
Why go through all this
to get you involved?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.252
Surely there's
other safe crackers around.

05:19.353 --> 05:21.254
There are, but I'm the only one
on record who's ever cracked

05:21.355 --> 05:22.823
a C.F. Kane-7 safe.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.792
I mean, it used to be
a badge of honor.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.760
Now it's a curse.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.030
Yeah, life can be ironic
that way.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.632
It's not fair.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.635
Look, I-I made
a mistake as a kid.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.103
I p-paid my dues.

05:36.203 --> 05:37.838
This is supposed
to be my second chance.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.807
And the world
just sees a criminal.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.842
From my boss taking
a cut of my paychecks

05:41.942 --> 05:43.944
to my P.O. threatening
to send me back

05:44.044 --> 05:45.779
if I don't pay him, but...

05:45.879 --> 05:48.115
but I'm the thief, right?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.754
I understand
getting second chances.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.658
I'll look into it.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.433
Robyn?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.034
Ah, ah, ah. Here.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.069
Hey.
Hey.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.175
I still feel like things
are a little, I don't know,

06:15.275 --> 06:17.811
off between us.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.913
Because they are.

06:22.349 --> 06:23.717
But it's not
just because of you.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.986
This whole new dynamic

06:26.086 --> 06:28.689
of my professional and
personal life intersecting.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.991
Yeah, I get it,
things are changing, but,

06:31.091 --> 06:32.626
Rob, it doesn't have to
be a bad thing.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.027
I know.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.696
But it's gonna take
some getting used to.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.999
Give me some time.
We'll get there.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.203
Okay.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.875
Yo.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.511
These are from Aunt Vi.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.680
Oh, yeah,

06:52.780 --> 06:54.615
I love surprises.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.956
Oh...
Oh...

07:03.056 --> 07:05.125
Oh, my goodness.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.628
I mean, who knew
that heaven itself

07:07.728 --> 07:09.262
could be delivered in a box?

07:09.362 --> 07:10.598
Those are Aunt Vi's

07:10.698 --> 07:12.099
"special occasion" brownies.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.001
How did you get her
to make these?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.869
I think it's her way of
thanking me for, uh, showing her

07:15.969 --> 07:18.238
how to exploit certain,
um, you know, some flaws

07:18.338 --> 07:20.173
in the content, uh,
streaming protocols.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.875
He gave her all his
streaming passwords.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.310
Hey, snitches

07:23.410 --> 07:24.411
get, uh...

07:24.512 --> 07:25.979
Brownies, I guess. Mmm.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.215
Oh.

07:28.315 --> 07:29.382
Mmm.

07:30.818 --> 07:31.885
Just talk to me
about Randall Grayle.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.353
Right, okay, so,
according to the FBI

07:33.453 --> 07:37.190
database, Randall
is the prime suspect in a dozen

07:37.290 --> 07:38.592
high-line robberies
across the country.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.628
And despite having
an arrest record

07:40.728 --> 07:42.863
as long as the BQE
and leaving a trail of bodies,

07:42.963 --> 07:45.566
nothing seems to stick.
Airtight alibis

07:45.666 --> 07:46.734
every time.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.768
And his last job, uh,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.670
an NYPD officer got killed.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.271
Okay, what's your gut
on Tim Fells?

07:51.371 --> 07:52.773
I don't know.
I feel for the guy.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.609
I mean, he made a mistake
a long time ago,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.477
but he's still paying for it.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.113
Sad truth is ex-cons
face two prison sentences--

08:00.213 --> 08:03.651
one behind bars and one when
they get back on the outside.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.685
It's a scarlet letter.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.654
What about
the brother?

08:06.754 --> 08:09.489
He spent four years in
foster care when Tim was inside,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.258
and now he's on the dean's list

08:11.358 --> 08:13.193
at City College.
As of two days ago,

08:13.293 --> 08:15.763
he's got no new activity on his
credit card or social media.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.898
Cell phone?
It's offline.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.767
I got a program running
right now to reconstruct

08:19.867 --> 08:21.535
his GPS from the last few days.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.837
I mean, it should
be ready soon.
The heist is tomorrow.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.839
We don't have a lot
of time to find him.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.174
And Randall has a history
of being calculating

08:27.274 --> 08:29.910
and volatile. If he even
suspects that Tim went

08:30.010 --> 08:31.945
to somebody for outside help...
Well, let's not give him

08:32.045 --> 08:34.081
a reason
to suspect.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.586
So, what's the plan?

08:38.686 --> 08:40.988
'Cause I'll do anything
to save my brother.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.489
Tell Randall you're in.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.124
Wait, you want me to go through
with the heist?

08:44.224 --> 08:46.126
Of course not.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.494
Just string him along
until we find Shawn.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.998
Randall can smell B.S.
from a mile away.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.333
What if he sees through me, huh?
He'll have Shawn killed

08:53.433 --> 08:55.936
on the spot.
If there was another
option, I wouldn't ask.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.238
We'll pull you out
as soon as we have Shawn.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.542
Okay.

09:02.643 --> 09:05.078
I'll tell him I'm in.
Good. And, Tim,

09:05.178 --> 09:08.882
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you or your brother.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.151
Okay.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.862
Oh.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.969
Yeah, baby!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.804
Y'all set again.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.474
Oh, yes. Yes.
Ugh, come on.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.712
Oh, my goodness.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.180
They're mighty quiet, Dee.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.149
Maybe it's all the L's
they've been taking.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.851
That's what it
sounds like to me.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.286
Well, well played, you two.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.156
Let's call it a day.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.259
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on now.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.827
We're just messing with you.
No, it's not that.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.995
We're just dealing
with some stuff at home.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.030
Mm-hmm.
Oh.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.966
Is everything okay?

09:59.066 --> 10:00.467
Not so much.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.535
But you know we're planning
on selling our house

10:02.636 --> 10:04.104
and moving to Florida.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.605
To be closer to our grandkids.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.440
But when we had our house
appraised, we were told

10:07.540 --> 10:10.110
that it's not worth
nearly what we thought.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.379
How's that possible?
A place that size with all that

10:12.479 --> 10:14.114
colonial architecture?
I think it'd be worth

10:14.214 --> 10:16.884
a fortune.
Not according to our appraiser.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.652
What burns me up
is this house

10:18.752 --> 10:20.888
down the block-- same square
footage, but a smaller yard--

10:20.988 --> 10:24.091
is on the market for double
what they say ours is worth.
Mm-hmm.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.395
Let me guess, the owners
of that property are white?

10:28.495 --> 10:30.998
Mm-hmm.
That's not right.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.499
I've heard about
this kind of thing.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.434
I've got a friend
in real estate,

10:34.534 --> 10:36.369
she says that time
and time again that

10:36.469 --> 10:38.972
minority-owned homes
come in far less

10:39.072 --> 10:41.875
than comparable
white-owned homes.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.244
Well, that goes back
to Jim Crow,

10:44.344 --> 10:47.180
redlining and white flight
in the 50s.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.317
It's government-sanctioned
racism.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.820
What can we do? When we pressed
the appraiser about it,

10:52.920 --> 10:54.487
all we got
was a runaround.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.624
What's the name
of the appraiser?

10:57.725 --> 11:00.593
Potter. Wallace Potter.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.495
Why?

11:15.475 --> 11:17.610
It's good to see you still have
a good head on your shoulders.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.047
Well, I, uh, thought
about what you said.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.082
You know, me
busting my ass

11:22.182 --> 11:23.851
on a loading dock--

11:23.951 --> 11:26.319
that ain't the move.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.222
Intel was spot-on.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.459
Randall Grayle's back in town.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.861
Should we move in?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.362
No. Grayle's slippery.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.897
We need more evidence
to send him away for good.

11:36.997 --> 11:40.267
But the moment he steps
out of line, he goes down.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.337
That's Tim Fells.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.806
If he's here,
then Randall's

11:45.906 --> 11:47.174
getting the band
back together.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.641
Set up the shotgun mics.
I need to hear

11:48.742 --> 11:49.676
what these guys are saying.

11:49.777 --> 11:50.878
Yes, sir.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.313
Whatever Randall's planning,

11:53.413 --> 11:56.216
he's not getting away with it
this time.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.727
What do you know
about Randall Grayle?

12:07.828 --> 12:10.197
I can tell you he's bad news.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.499
In fact, we have information
he's planning something.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.467
The second he moves,

12:14.567 --> 12:16.069
we're taking him down.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.405
Can you press pause on that?
Absolutely not.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.108
Randall's slipped through
our fingers in the past. This is

12:21.208 --> 12:23.543
the first time he's shown his
face in New York in three years.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.744
We may not get another chance.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.547
Well, the problem is

12:27.647 --> 12:29.549
he kidnapped
my client's brother.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.551
He's forcing him
to pull a heist.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.954
I just need to some time
to get the kid back.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.856
I don't know what to tell you.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.991
The only reason we haven't moved
on Grayle already

12:38.091 --> 12:40.360
is we want to make sure
we have concrete evidence

12:40.460 --> 12:41.628
and do everything by the book.

12:41.728 --> 12:44.364
All I need is one,
two days, tops.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.765
You got to understand,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.667
Randall Grayle is a cop killer.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.103
I personally
had to tell

12:50.203 --> 12:51.571
a fellow officer's
four-year-old daughter

12:51.671 --> 12:52.772
that her father
wasn't coming home

12:52.873 --> 12:54.041
after he clashed with Randall.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.708
I promised that officer's wife

12:55.809 --> 12:57.077
I would bring Randall down,

12:57.177 --> 12:58.745
and that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.180
If you move on Randall,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.415
he'll assume
our client sold him out.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.018
He'll kill his brother for sure.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.055
Let me guess,
Tim Fells is your client.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.625
I can't let Randall walk.
I'm not asking you to.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.327
We can work together
to take him down.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.896
As soon as I

13:15.996 --> 13:17.464
know the brother's
out of danger.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.866
I don't know, Robyn.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.034
Randall's slippery.
The longer I wait...

13:21.134 --> 13:24.271
Look, have I ever let you down?

13:25.572 --> 13:28.275
You got to trust me on this one.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.714
Can Fells tell us where
that heist is happening?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.683
What he knows, we'll know. Okay.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.118
The moment you find
the brother...

13:38.218 --> 13:40.287
We'll help you
take Randall down.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.223
<i>So, uh...</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:44.624
rare coins?

13:44.724 --> 13:46.693
Lost gold from Napoleon
or something.

13:46.793 --> 13:50.397
All I know is we're
talking eight figures.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.601
I got a fence lined up
and everything.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.004
What'd I miss?
Talking about the score,

13:57.104 --> 13:58.838
but no details
of where it's happening.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.208
It's, uh...

14:01.308 --> 14:02.876
it's cool.

14:06.880 --> 14:09.116
What's going on with you, man?

14:09.216 --> 14:12.019
What do you mean?
I mean, I'm dropping
a life-changing gig

14:12.119 --> 14:14.154
in your lap,
and you're acting like it's

14:14.254 --> 14:15.522
no big deal.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.424
I'm just worried about
my brother, you know?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.159
Look,

14:19.259 --> 14:21.528
I'm here, I'm down.
Like, can't you

14:21.628 --> 14:22.562
let Shawn go?
Nah.

14:22.662 --> 14:23.663
You don't seem down, man,

14:23.763 --> 14:24.932
so I'm gonna hold on to baby bro

14:25.032 --> 14:26.433
until I get what I want.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.870
Yeah.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.139
Uh, I think
we should call it off.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.406
The old man
is getting suspicious.

14:33.506 --> 14:34.942
Then calm him down.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.044
You can't play your role,
I don't know what good you are.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.979
Handle your uncle, man,

14:39.079 --> 14:40.680
or I will.
I want a trace on that call.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.151
That about the job?
Don't worry about it.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.353
All you need to be concerned
with is doing your job.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.720
Crack that safe when I tell you.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.957
Do that, your brother lives.
You don't...

14:50.057 --> 14:51.758
Look, Randall, I swear...
Come back in three hours when

14:51.858 --> 14:53.927
the rest of the crew's here.
We'll go over the particulars.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.129
He's talking a lot
about this job, but still not

14:56.229 --> 14:57.497
a damn thing about
the when or where.

14:57.597 --> 14:58.798
I want to know the second

14:58.898 --> 15:00.867
he gets into the specifics.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.511
Mr. Potter. Please,

15:11.611 --> 15:13.380
come in.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.987
Thank you for
coming on such

15:20.087 --> 15:22.255
short notice.
You were a
little insistent, ma'am.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.490
Uh, before we begin,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.058
is there anything

15:25.158 --> 15:26.859
I should know
about the-the house,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.996
the property?
No, no, no, just that

15:29.096 --> 15:30.597
I'm-I'm considering a re-fi,

15:30.697 --> 15:33.400
and I-I just want to know
what I'm looking at. Ah.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.069
Please.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.177
<i>Harry, I just left
Shawn's apartment.</i>

15:44.277 --> 15:45.945
Spoke to some of his neighbors.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.347
No one's seen him in days.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.082
That lines up
with what we found.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.184
Harry reconstructed
Shawn's movements

15:51.284 --> 15:53.253
using his cell phone's GPS data.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.522
Yeah, so, two days ago,
he left his night class,

15:55.622 --> 15:57.057
then his signal disappeared.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.392
Briefly popped back up again
at around 11:00 p.m.,

15:59.492 --> 16:02.162
and then it vanished for good.
Where?

16:03.530 --> 16:05.398
Near a Dino's Pizzeria

16:05.498 --> 16:08.935
in Canarsie.
There aren't any working
street cams in the area, but

16:09.036 --> 16:11.638
check this out. I did a little
recon on the pizza joint

16:11.738 --> 16:13.440
owner, one
Dino Garruzzo.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.975
And turns out he did five years
on a RICO charge,

16:16.076 --> 16:18.111
and that wasn't his first
brush with the law, either.
Wait a minute.

16:18.211 --> 16:20.547
Dino and Randall Grayle
got arrested together

16:20.647 --> 16:22.782
when Randall
was 18.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.351
That can't be
a coincidence.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.219
You think that's where Randall
could be holding him?

16:26.319 --> 16:27.654
It's worth taking a look.

16:27.754 --> 16:28.988
But we can't go in
guns blazing.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.123
They could kill Shawn
before we get there.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.458
I have an idea. Harry,

16:31.558 --> 16:33.460
do you own a sport jacket?
Uh...

16:33.560 --> 16:34.861
yeah. Maybe.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.963
I mean, I might have
something better.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.504
Hello.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.838
Hi. Can I help you?

16:45.938 --> 16:48.741
Yeah. Richard Hagen.
Health inspector.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.110
Oh, come on.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
You guys were just here
last month.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.046
Yeah, well,

16:53.146 --> 16:55.682
Maybe we should
step it up to weekly.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.984
Can you at least come back?
I'm the only one here.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.353
Yeah, including,
uh, the customers.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.889
You think the low foot traffic
might be attributed

17:02.989 --> 17:04.791
to the "B" hanging
in your window?

17:04.891 --> 17:06.293
Which I'm starting to think

17:06.393 --> 17:09.729
was...
graded on a curve.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.732
Do you think maybe
we could, um...

17:12.832 --> 17:14.834
work something out?
Young lady,

17:14.934 --> 17:16.836
are you offering me a bribe?

17:16.936 --> 17:18.004
Because that is a nasty

17:18.105 --> 17:19.639
infraction of public corruption,

17:19.739 --> 17:21.341
Code 387 subsection 2,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.076
punishable by up to...
No, okay, no.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.945
I was just... thinking
maybe you might want a slice

17:26.045 --> 17:28.181
before you start inspecting.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.950
Look, this face might scream
"thrill-seeker," but there are

17:31.050 --> 17:33.286
some risks I'm just
not willing to take.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.487
I'll start in the basement. Uh...

17:34.587 --> 17:36.156
No, I'm good.
I got it.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.167
How's it going?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.868
He's not here.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.304
Maybe we got it all wrong.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.579
Hey, wait a minute.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.947
Just found an insulin pen.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.149
Didn't Tim say Shawn
was diabetic?

18:02.249 --> 18:05.152
Sure did.
Shawn was in that room.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.622
Wait, whoa, hold on.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.465
Mel, there's another exit.
Down the block.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.533
What? Where?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.175
I see 'em.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.653
Damn it.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.623
Rob, Shawn was here.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.258
We just missed him.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.794
Damn. Any idea
where they're taking him?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.563
No, but I got the plates
off the car he took off in.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.831
Hold on, Tim's calling.

18:51.931 --> 18:52.899
Tim.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.501
Listen, we got some news.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.703
Please tell me you found Shawn
because we out of time.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.905
What are you talking about?
He-he moved up the heist.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.507
It's going down tonight.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.309
Okay.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.144
We have a lead on Shawn,
but I need a little more time

19:05.245 --> 19:06.946
to find him.
What am I supposed to do?

19:07.046 --> 19:09.048
You're gonna
have to stop pretending

19:09.148 --> 19:11.718
and actually
go through with the heist.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.063
Was just about to call you.
What's up?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.832
Hey, I just got a panicked call

19:25.932 --> 19:28.134
from Tim about the heist.
What about it?

19:28.235 --> 19:30.203
It's going down tonight.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.971
Thanks for the heads up.

19:32.071 --> 19:34.374
I'll tell my team to be ready
to take Randall down. No.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.376
We still don't have Shawn.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.944
Are you any closer
to finding him?

19:38.044 --> 19:39.412
Harry's tracking
a lead right now.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.913
I just need a little more time.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.682
Robyn, this man is a killer.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.551
It's irresponsible to let him
get away with this heist.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.852
People will get hurt.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.887
Not if we play this
the right way.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.289
Which is?

19:49.389 --> 19:50.690
Have Tim go along for the heist.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.325
What?
At the same time,

19:52.425 --> 19:53.926
we infiltrate Randall's crew,

19:54.026 --> 19:55.295
that way we control
the situation.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.696
I don't like it.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.764
Feels like we're playing
roulette on this one.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.098
I know it's risky,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.533
but it gives us a chance
to save them both.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.534
Or lose them both.

20:01.634 --> 20:02.569
If Tim's exposed,

20:02.669 --> 20:03.570
then both brothers die.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.538
Well, you go in now,

20:05.638 --> 20:07.907
you lose lives for sure.

20:09.141 --> 20:10.277
Okay.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.211
How do you want to play it?

20:15.282 --> 20:16.649
This the whole crew?

20:16.749 --> 20:17.917
That we know of.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.419
So if we want to infiltrate

20:19.519 --> 20:20.753
Randall's operation,
we got to create an opening,

20:20.853 --> 20:21.954
put one of these
three on ice.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.656
Question is, which one?

20:23.756 --> 20:25.525
First up is the wheel woman,
Lane Carter, master

20:25.625 --> 20:27.894
at grand theft auto.
Yeah, but then I'd be stuck
on the perimeter.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.629
I need to be close
to watch Tim's back.

20:29.729 --> 20:30.730
Okay. All right.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.764
Who's next?
Hasan Abbas.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.165
Arrested a half dozen times

20:33.266 --> 20:34.200
for cybercrimes.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.268
He's their Harry.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.303
As though

20:36.403 --> 20:37.304
I'd get caught six times.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.571
I've been arrested once.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.139
Granted, it was by the CIA.

20:40.807 --> 20:41.808
You're very handsome, though. Okay.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.310
Thank you. I... The point is

20:43.410 --> 20:45.011
is I that could do this one
with my eyes closed.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.280
Good, but then who would be here
helping Rob track Shawn?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.716
Okay, true.
Uh, what about the third guy?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.183
What's his deal?
Carmine Nolfi.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.553
Ex-military. Proficient
in close quarters combat.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.854
Okay, so their tough guy,

20:54.954 --> 20:56.723
security, breaking-
and-entering expert.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.659
He's our in.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.729
Okay, but who's
taking his place?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.164
Dude.
It's... He just...

21:05.765 --> 21:07.867
Relax, honey, he's just
getting to know you.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.640
Mighty fine house you have here.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.509
Especially given
your lack of upgrades,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.778
I think you'll find
that I've been

21:18.878 --> 21:22.315
quite... generous.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.183
Thank you.

21:25.352 --> 21:26.686
Are you quite sure?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.155
Because the family
across the street

21:29.255 --> 21:32.091
sold their home for
almost twice as much as this.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.426
I didn't appraise
that property, ma'am,

21:33.526 --> 21:35.261
but perhaps
they did a-a remodel?

21:35.362 --> 21:36.963
A new kitchen?
No, no, nothing like that.

21:37.063 --> 21:38.365
You know what?

21:38.465 --> 21:41.267
I'd like a second opinion.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.941
Mrs. Scott?

21:49.041 --> 21:50.743
What are you doing here?
Investigating.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.012
I got a call saying
one of our appraisers

21:53.112 --> 21:55.615
was intentionally
lowballing clients.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.550
And here's
the proof.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.251
Is this really your work?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.888
How do you explain this?
I-I ran the numbers and...

22:01.988 --> 22:04.824
Like hell you did. I was here
earlier and, unlike you,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.893
did a thorough assessment
of this property.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.561
But, ma'am...
But nothing.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.929
You're gone.
Effective immediately.

22:10.029 --> 22:11.964
Not only are you done
in this business,

22:12.064 --> 22:13.833
but I will
pursue charges.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.869
Now get out of my house.

22:27.246 --> 22:29.749
All right, guys, listen up so
you understand tonight's plan.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.984
Wait, where's Carmine?
He's late.

22:32.084 --> 22:35.287
And he better have a damn good
excuse. Okay. Once we're through

22:35.388 --> 22:36.656
the perimeter fence,

22:36.756 --> 22:37.857
there's a
surveillance system

22:37.957 --> 22:39.526
that blankets
the facility.

22:39.626 --> 22:40.927
Hasan?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.929
Malfunction or make us ghosts?
Ghost.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.230
Less of a trail the better.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.498
What about a security patrol?

22:45.598 --> 22:46.933
Small group of rent-a-cops.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.768
They're armed
but spread thin at this hour,

22:48.868 --> 22:50.803
so I've timed
their routine.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.405
Ten minute coffee break,

22:52.505 --> 22:54.607
then they alternate at the john
for the next five

22:54.707 --> 22:55.875
and then they're back on patrol.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.444
Reliable as a Rolex.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.447
That only gives us a 15-minute
window to get in and out.

23:00.547 --> 23:01.748
14.5, and not a second extra.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.816
After that the main
shift clocks in

23:03.916 --> 23:06.052
and the place is
crawling with them.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.820
Lane,

23:07.920 --> 23:09.221
you're on overwatch.
Copy that.

23:09.321 --> 23:10.990
Once we get to
the target location,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.493
there's an industrial padlock,
which is on Carmine...

23:13.593 --> 23:15.194
if he ever gets here.

23:15.294 --> 23:17.530
And then all that stands
between us

23:17.630 --> 23:18.998
and sitting on a beach in Fiji

23:19.098 --> 23:21.734
is a C.F. Kane Mark 7 safe.

23:22.535 --> 23:23.970
It's no sweat.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.672
You'll have less than
five minutes to crack it,

23:25.772 --> 23:27.139
so I hope you're right.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.911
Tim, let Carmine in.

23:36.816 --> 23:39.552
Keep your eyes
peeled on this guy.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.693
Whoa!
Whoa!

23:46.793 --> 23:48.995
Ooh...

23:49.095 --> 23:50.362
Who the hell are you?

23:50.463 --> 23:51.664
Angela Yeung.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.899
Carmine sent me.
He didn't call you?

23:52.999 --> 23:54.266
No, he didn't.

23:54.366 --> 23:56.002
Easy, all right?
Carmine called me,

23:56.102 --> 23:58.771
said he was in a jam,
needed someone to cover for him.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.307
Said you needed muscle on a job.

24:01.407 --> 24:02.742
So he sent you?

24:02.842 --> 24:03.910
All right.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.812
Where the hell's
Carmine anyway?

24:05.912 --> 24:07.947
Look, I am just trying
to do him a solid,

24:08.047 --> 24:09.181
but if you don't need my help,

24:09.281 --> 24:10.683
I could just jet.
No, no, no.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.585
It's okay.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.554
You're not leaving.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.856
Not until I get some answers.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.294
We got it. His phone is cloned.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.734
Randall, my bad for bailing
the last minute,

24:27.834 --> 24:30.970
but I got to go down to Florida.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.572
My mother's not doing well.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.241
You're leaving me
in a very bad position here.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.611
I'm sorry, man.
I'll make it up to you,

24:38.711 --> 24:40.179
but Angela is top-notch.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.280
You can trust...

24:41.380 --> 24:43.149
I don't care
what Carmine...

24:50.657 --> 24:52.692
Okay. You'll do.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.260
But if I smell anything rotten,

24:54.360 --> 24:55.795
I'm gonna put a bullet
in your pretty face

24:55.895 --> 24:56.829
before you can blink.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.330
Thank you for calling me pretty.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.967
Hasan, get the hell up.
Lane, collect everyone's phones.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.402
Make sure we're completely
dark on this.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.243
Hey, Rob? Good news.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.112
Were you able to track
that car that took Shawn?

25:13.212 --> 25:15.948
No. Uh, there was no LoJack
or OnStar, but Mel and I were

25:16.048 --> 25:17.083
able to clone Randall's phone.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.517
He received an incoming call

25:18.618 --> 25:19.552
five minutes after we missed

25:19.652 --> 25:20.820
Shawn at the pizza place.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.421
That's got to be the kidnappers.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.424
Yeah, the phone
is in Long Island City,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.393
just under the
Queensboro Bridge.

25:27.493 --> 25:28.661
Send me the coordinates.

25:28.761 --> 25:29.962
If I can get there in time,

25:30.062 --> 25:32.699
I can pull Tim
before Dante moves in.

25:34.133 --> 25:35.935
Randall, I'm getting
a strange frequency.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.370
Some kind of
communication signal.

25:38.470 --> 25:39.872
It's coming from

25:39.972 --> 25:41.808
inside the loft.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.776
Are all the phones off?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.645
Just like you asked.
Scan everybody.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.581
Tim, if you're wearing a wire,
so help me God...

26:01.427 --> 26:02.862
Mel?

26:02.962 --> 26:05.031
Mel!

26:50.009 --> 26:51.678
Hey.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.545
Who the hell are you?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.696
Hey,

27:09.796 --> 27:11.698
I-I... I don't
want any problems.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.900
I'm from the National Grid.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.502
Yeah. That don't explain
you nosing around.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.470
I was coming back
from another job, and I saw

27:18.570 --> 27:19.939
the lights were on,
and I thought to myself,

27:20.039 --> 27:22.675
"We cut the power off
there months ago."

27:22.775 --> 27:26.178
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.613
Inside, now.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.615
Um, I just...
Let's go.

27:33.519 --> 27:35.254
What's the latest?

27:35.354 --> 27:37.189
A woman joined the crew

27:37.289 --> 27:38.524
a little while ago,

27:38.624 --> 27:40.126
and it's been 15 minutes
without any noise.

27:46.532 --> 27:47.533
Hey, Harry. How's Mel doing?

27:47.633 --> 27:48.467
I don't know, man.

27:48.567 --> 27:49.736
Her comms went down.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.270
She's flying blind.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.772
It's gonna be okay.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.406
If anything bad had happened,
I'd know about it.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.775
Okay, all right.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.777
But is there any way
to get eyes on her?

28:19.431 --> 28:20.833
<i>What do you mean, gone?</i>

28:20.933 --> 28:22.969
There was no one
inside the loft.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.738
Come on, Dante. I thought
you had eyes on the place.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.273
So did I. Look, I don't
like this any more than you.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.574
Oh, please, come on.

28:28.674 --> 28:29.976
She's my wife, Dante.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.078
Randall needs her, Harry.
He didn't kill her.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.146
Okay, fine,
but w-where did they go?

28:34.246 --> 28:36.682
H-How did they just disappear
into thin air?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.593
I don't know,
but there's no world

28:47.693 --> 28:49.128
where this guy gets away again.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.530
Hold on a sec, Harry.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.735
Harry, we just got an ID
and addy on the man

28:56.836 --> 28:58.570
Randall spoke with
earlier on the phone.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.072
Name's Yves

29:00.172 --> 29:02.508
Ballentine.
He's connected to this somehow.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.210
I'm sending a unit there now.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.749
So, uh, why all the effort?

29:11.517 --> 29:13.786
You got some reason
to believe the cops are onto us?
Always

29:13.886 --> 29:15.054
assume the cops are watching
or listening.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.789
Why do you think
I haven't been caught?

29:19.058 --> 29:21.327
Lane, head over

29:21.427 --> 29:22.929
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.834
So, that's where the coins are?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.735
In a shipping container
that leaves in the morning.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.804
Only when it does,

29:31.904 --> 29:34.273
those coins won't be on it.

29:42.681 --> 29:45.184
He doesn't look so good.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.553
Can you at least
take out the gag?

29:47.653 --> 29:49.055
He can barely breathe.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.522
Hey, hey, what
are you doing?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.790
She's right.
He doesn't look that good.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.425
Why you listen to her?

29:56.262 --> 29:58.597
Aah!

30:14.580 --> 30:15.547
Get this off you.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.685
Hey...

30:19.785 --> 30:21.921
I-I... I don't feel...

30:22.021 --> 30:24.590
Just hang on, hang on. We're
gonna get you to a hospital.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.226
Let's go. Come on.

30:54.086 --> 30:57.456
Get us to shipping
container RKO 281.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.125
We got 90 seconds
before it resets.

30:59.225 --> 31:01.427
All right, we got
to hustle. Let's go.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.096
What's this all about?

31:04.196 --> 31:05.864
I know you're mixed up in
Randall Grayle's latest score.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.866
Where's it going down?
Before you lie to me again,

31:07.967 --> 31:10.169
keep in mind you're working
with a cop killer.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.839
Any bodies drop tonight,
you're an accessory to murder.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.275
Unless you start
talking now!

31:16.375 --> 31:18.010
When we get there,
what am I doing?

31:18.110 --> 31:19.811
Inside the container
is a former SAS operative

31:19.912 --> 31:22.548
protecting the coins,
as in Great Britain's SAS.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.883
They train specifically
in close-quarters combat.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.485
Yeah, it's not my first
rodeo. I got it.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.586
Boom. There it is.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.521
87 seconds. Not bad, Hasan.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.323
All right, hot shot.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.901
Open it.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.485
Whoa! You want
a body on this?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.887
'Cause I didn't sign up
for that kind of manhunt.

32:03.889 --> 32:06.758
All right.
Tim, let's go. You're up.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.434
What's wrong? Get to it.
This is a Mark 9.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.669
You said it was the Mark 7.
This ain't the right safe.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.105
Please tell me
that's not a problem.

32:19.205 --> 32:23.242
It's a completely different
mechanism on the Mark 9.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.445
You have four minutes
and 36 seconds

32:26.545 --> 32:29.548
before those guards walk by
and see that lock on the floor.

32:29.648 --> 32:30.949
That's how much time you have

32:31.050 --> 32:33.986
before your family
bloodline ends tonight.

32:43.562 --> 32:46.065
Dante, I just saved Shawn.

32:46.165 --> 32:48.734
I'm on my way to you.
Can you reach Mel?

32:48.834 --> 32:50.502
We lost contact with her
a while ago,

32:50.602 --> 32:52.704
but Randall is making his play
at the navy shipyard right now.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.206
My team is on their way.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.707
Well, can you hold back
for 15 minutes?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.443
And risk losing them?

32:57.543 --> 32:59.445
That's not happening.
I'll be there soon.

32:59.545 --> 33:00.812
Just don't arrest Tim.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.381
I'm taking Randall down.
I'll do what I can,

33:02.481 --> 33:04.916
but I can't guarantee
Tim won't wind up in custody.

33:19.898 --> 33:22.168
Lane, how's it going out there?

33:22.268 --> 33:24.470
Quiet, but not for much longer.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.338
Yo, Tim.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.806
He's working
as fast as he can.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.208
He needs to work a lot faster.

33:37.983 --> 33:40.286
Damn.
Okay, okay, come on, come on.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.888
We're not gonna make it.
He's taking too long.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.657
Damn it, Tim.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.494
Time's up.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.329
We're out of time!

33:54.333 --> 33:55.401
Yes.

34:02.141 --> 34:04.076
Beautiful.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.011
Let's go. Let's go.

34:06.112 --> 34:08.013
Get out of the way.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.359
The cops are here. Get out now.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.993
The cops shouldn't
be on us already.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.395
Someone
alerted them.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.931
I knew you couldn't be trusted.
I knew it.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.447
Go get Randall!

35:28.827 --> 35:31.397
Stop! NYPD!

35:36.034 --> 35:38.136
Aah!

35:38.937 --> 35:40.206
Aah!

36:09.768 --> 36:12.103
Aah!

36:14.473 --> 36:17.108
You okay?

36:17.209 --> 36:18.577
Yeah.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.479
Yeah.
Oh.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.781
Where's Randall?

36:27.219 --> 36:29.688
You let him go.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.691
To save me.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.470
Tim Fells.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.638
NYPD.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.184
Your brother is safe.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.029
Thank you, man.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.183
Where's Randall?

37:35.987 --> 37:38.324
Dante...

37:38.424 --> 37:39.925
You said you'd be here.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.762
I had him.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.898
He was right there,
but I let him get away.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.502
I should have taken him down
when I had the chance,

37:50.602 --> 37:53.071
but I let your needs get
in the way of me doing my job.

37:53.171 --> 37:57.108
Dante, I promise,
I will help you find Randall.

37:58.377 --> 37:59.545
Sooner or later, he's gonna have

37:59.645 --> 38:01.079
to resurface
to sell those coins.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.349
Don't you get it?

38:03.449 --> 38:05.884
We'll never see Randall again.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.388
Dante, wait.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.122
Be seeing you.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.258
Dante!

38:30.008 --> 38:33.512
Are you sure there isn't
any way I can repay you?

38:33.612 --> 38:34.780
Pay it forward.

38:34.880 --> 38:35.947
Try to be there

38:36.047 --> 38:37.282
for the next person

38:37.383 --> 38:38.384
who needs a second chance.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.151
And make good use

38:40.251 --> 38:44.222
of the one you'll get
with your brother.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.727
Hey.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.295
Shawn.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.731
I'm sorry, man,

38:52.831 --> 38:54.332
for everything. No, no, no, no. Tim...

38:54.433 --> 38:55.934
I-I don't blame you
for not talking to me.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.969
I told you I would be there
for you, and I wasn't.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.270
All right? That's on me.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.706
She told me you
risked everything

39:00.806 --> 39:02.741
to save me.

39:06.311 --> 39:09.381
Man, after all
I put you through?

39:10.215 --> 39:12.918
I couldn't lose you again, man.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.361
Thank you.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.735
<i>Thanks again. Bye-bye.</i>

39:30.536 --> 39:31.803
Hey.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.606
Everything okay?
Better than okay.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.442
Cecil and Kat's appraiser's

39:36.542 --> 39:38.510
gonna get his license revoked.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.846
Oh, my gosh. Wait!

39:40.946 --> 39:42.848
Uh, look, I want to say
I feel bad for him,

39:42.948 --> 39:45.150
but it serves him right. Unfortunately,

39:45.250 --> 39:47.519
there are a lot more like him
out there, but at least

39:47.619 --> 39:48.620
we got rid of one bad one.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.689
Yeah.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.158
True.
Well, what about Kat and Cecil?

39:53.258 --> 39:55.627
They're going to get
a new appraisal

39:55.727 --> 39:58.063
at no charge.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.398
So they can finally move
to Florida like they planned,

40:00.499 --> 40:01.933
and we don't got to take 'em

40:02.033 --> 40:03.502
all the way back to Boston,
am I right?

40:03.602 --> 40:06.337
We made 'em walk
to Boston last night.
Yeah, we did.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.675
Good morning. Morning.
Oh, morning.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.710
What you two
so excited about?

40:11.810 --> 40:13.912
Ah, well,
you should have seen it, Mom.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.147
Aunt Vi took no prisoners yesterday.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.584
She put Cecil and Kat's
appraiser on blast

40:18.684 --> 40:20.786
and got them the appraisal
they needed so they can

40:20.886 --> 40:23.321
sell their house and move.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.424
Oh. It's good
to have a friend like you.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.897
Is everything good?

40:37.035 --> 40:40.105
Honestly, no.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.743
You want to talk about it?

40:44.843 --> 40:46.311
It might help.

40:47.713 --> 40:51.249
A friend trusted me to come
through for them yesterday...

40:52.818 --> 40:55.153
...and I let them down.

40:55.253 --> 40:58.089
I'm sure they'll understand.

40:59.357 --> 41:01.292
Maybe you can
make it up to 'em.

41:02.594 --> 41:04.429
That's the plan.

41:05.230 --> 41:08.867
But in the meantime, I have
to live with these feelings.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.103
And they're not good.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.307
Mom.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.945
It's gonna be okay.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.780
It's not the end
of the world.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.315
I'm sure you're right.

41:27.586 --> 41:29.821
But it sure does feel like it.
