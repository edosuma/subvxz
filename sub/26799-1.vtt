01:46.374 --> 01:48.276
Life is a series of moments

01:48.809 --> 01:50.978
where every thought, every word,

01:51.011 --> 01:53.881
and every action ripples
throughout eternity.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.386
Love knows no boundaries.

01:59.187 --> 02:02.223
There is a battle between
the light and the darkness

02:02.623 --> 02:04.124
that rages for each soul.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.060
The gift of life
stands before you,

02:08.562 --> 02:11.665
and one day, the light
will reveal all things.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.578
Jonah?

03:23.036 --> 03:23.971
Jonah?

04:03.844 --> 04:04.945
Jonah, no!

04:17.190 --> 04:18.659
Jonah!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.150
There was a big battle
on the senate floor yesterday

04:43.183 --> 04:45.185
as freshman senator,
Jonah Thomas,

04:45.218 --> 04:46.554
the rising star in the Senate,

04:47.020 --> 04:50.023
vehemently opposed
Senator Rushton's tax increase

04:50.057 --> 04:51.525
stating that raising taxes

04:51.559 --> 04:53.827
on the already over-burdened
American family

04:53.861 --> 04:56.697
was like a declaration
of war against its citizens.

04:58.165 --> 04:59.967
Here's more from Senator Thomas.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.936
Well, the American citizens
won a small victory today.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.271
If my colleagues in the Senate

05:04.304 --> 05:05.873
actually had the guts
and the integrity

05:05.906 --> 05:08.342
to truly represent the
interests of the people

05:08.376 --> 05:10.644
and not their own,
we'd be well on our way

05:10.911 --> 05:12.079
to makin' this country
great again.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.316
Senator Rushton
is not one to give in easily,

05:16.350 --> 05:17.518
stating that his proposal

05:17.551 --> 05:19.387
would help stimulate
the US economy.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.023
He is on a mission.
I want him out of the picture.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.394
It's got teeth.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.499
There's no way they can
prove it's not true.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.603
Just give me a day
to set it in motion.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.706
Make it happen this afternoon.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.275
I think Senator Rushton's
gonna come after me.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.787
Hey, Pam.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.990
This better be good, Winston.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.358
You know I don't like
to be bothered

05:58.392 --> 05:59.259
when I'm out here.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.895
Thought you might like to know
that your hunch was correct.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.532
Baker's office
has been in contact

06:04.565 --> 06:06.467
with this woman for months.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.636
Jane Isner.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.140
Now she's Richards'
new personal assistant.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.908
She's Baker's insider.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.076
How'd you make the connection?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.412
Called in a few favors.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.280
All strictly legal.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.183
Um... Every path to Baker
is a dead end.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.719
Baker used to be FBI
before he became a senator.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.720
He knows all the methods,

06:26.987 --> 06:28.589
but I have a secret weapon.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.157
-What's that?
-You.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.760
But I'm just a consultant.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.662
Exactly, you're not really FBI.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.798
Keep fishing.
I wanna know how Baker
fits in to all of this.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.332
What do we use as bait?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.035
I've got a team
going after Richards.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.370
He's having a secret meeting

06:43.403 --> 06:45.138
about his vaccine bill today.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.607
Dirty money and everything.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.111
Why haven't they taken any steps

06:51.144 --> 06:52.179
to balance the budget?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.414
Our national debt is
spiraling out of control.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.784
Today was an unfortunate
setback.

06:57.317 --> 06:58.986
I'm fighting for
the little guy here.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.788
This battle is sure to continue,

07:01.421 --> 07:04.625
but most would agree round one
goes to Senator Thomas.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.262
- Yeah, everything looks great.
- The numbers look great.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.067
Yeah, well, the lawyers
have to approve everything

07:14.101 --> 07:15.368
but we need to get together.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.438
The FBI doesn't know
about the second vaccine.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.240
I'll make sure it
stays that way.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.274
Okay.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.878
Senator Baker?

07:27.515 --> 07:28.381
Sir?

07:30.383 --> 07:31.819
It's going down this morning.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.425
Sanders
is really focused on this one.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.359
The pressure's high.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.729
-You wanna come along?
-I'm hunting big game today.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.463
Bigger game than
three US senators?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.500
I'm expecting a briefing
at four.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.035
I'll see you at four.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.937
Happy hunting.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.243
The cancer vaccine
stops or cures 99 percent.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.546
Your father happens
to fall in the 1 percent.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.380
You have no idea
how much suffering

08:00.413 --> 08:01.715
my father has gone through

08:01.749 --> 08:04.251
because of their so called
cancer-curing vaccine.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.521
We should talk later
when cooler heads prevail.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.361
I'm giving you the opportunity
to be the hero.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.630
10 million is pocket change

08:16.664 --> 08:18.899
in comparison to the windfall
they're about to have.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.467
How do I know you'll hand over

08:20.500 --> 08:21.835
all the data on the vaccine?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.070
How can I trust you?

08:23.336 --> 08:24.337
Trust.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.708
Trust goes both ways.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.043
This needs to happen today.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.412
Even they don't have that
kind of money sitting around.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.315
Besides, they haven't passed
the bill yet.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.384
It'll pass.
I'll bring all the data

08:37.417 --> 08:39.019
and we'll all sign
the papers together.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.352
Deal?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.756
We have a deal.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.326
They have a meeting at the
Artisan penthouse around 11.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.828
Senator Williams
likes the chefs,

08:47.861 --> 08:49.096
so they'll have a late lunch.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.264
Be there at 1:30, no sooner.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.365
I'll be there.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.668
The hotel is closed
for renovations.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.103
I'll leave a message
at the front desk

08:56.136 --> 08:57.537
for you to be escorted
to the penthouse.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.439
If I sense that
there's any trouble,

08:59.472 --> 09:01.441
I'll leave and release
the information.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.644
Understood?

09:04.778 --> 09:05.713
Understood.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.487
What if they release the data?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.324
How do you think they got
the data in the first place?

09:17.791 --> 09:19.392
Our vaccine is perfect.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.462
Senator Richards' vaccine
is flawed.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.697
It's terribly flawed

09:23.731 --> 09:25.065
and we've got to do
something about it.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.768
Just keep us up to date
on all the details.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.270
Will do.
Thank you, gentlemen.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.577
You called it.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.886
They're meeting
at the Artisan today.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.254
They should be
the only ones there.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.622
No civilian casualties.

09:48.656 --> 09:49.823
You don't have to go.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.159
I can do it myself.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.261
Dad, there's no turning back.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.897
I'm the one that convinced you
to take it in the first place

09:56.930 --> 09:58.866
because they guaranteed me
it would work.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.601
Look,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.805
I want them to pay
just as much as you do.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.107
Senator McLuster talked about

10:07.140 --> 10:09.142
the possible human
suffering from the vaccine

10:09.176 --> 10:11.344
as a risk-versus-reward scenario

10:11.378 --> 10:13.881
as if he were talking
about sacks of potatoes.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.117
They're getting off easy
as far as I'm concerned.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.391
You're gonna have to
finish the last two.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.175
Well, if it looks,
talks, and walks

10:42.209 --> 10:43.643
like a duck, it's a duck.

10:43.677 --> 10:45.045
In this case, it's a pig.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.050
What? Today?

10:51.051 --> 10:52.085
Hold on.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.390
Yeah, well, what time?

10:58.358 --> 10:59.259
Two o'clock?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.661
Yeah, no problem.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.196
I don't have anything
important scheduled at two.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.231
I can make that, no problem.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.202
Yeah, well that's what I
was trying to tell you.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.403
It just makes sense.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.040
I mean, we gotta hold
these people accountable.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.375
Sorry
for the impromptu gathering,

11:15.709 --> 11:17.077
but we've had
some important meetings

11:17.110 --> 11:18.211
come up this morning.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.248
I was able to push back
the retool meeting
to ten o'clock,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.550
and I just heard you
snagged a two o'clock

11:23.583 --> 11:25.385
-on the pure water project?
-Mm-hm.

11:25.418 --> 11:26.920
I thought
that would never happen.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.088
You said you were gonna go

11:28.121 --> 11:29.589
to Chloe's tennis
match at two today.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.591
I have been trying
to arrange this meeting

11:31.624 --> 11:32.893
for the last three months.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.361
Who knows when I'll get
another opportunity.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.196
There'll be other
tennis matches.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.798
What's next?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.201
Your speech and victory
on the Senate floor

11:41.234 --> 11:43.370
turned a lot of heads,
including the Martins.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.338
They wanna have the family
over for dinner

11:45.372 --> 11:46.774
tonight at their place
about seven.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.609
They raised six figures
for Congressman Gidell,

11:49.642 --> 11:50.778
and they don't even like him.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.046
This should get us closer
to our financial goals.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.782
How's that sound?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.283
Sounds like we're gonna miss
another family night.

11:57.785 --> 11:58.651
We'll be there.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.821
All right, I'll let them know
you're coming.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.990
And I'll see you
back at the office.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.122
Just trust me this one time.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.090
I really, really feel strongly

12:37.124 --> 12:38.625
about you not going
to work today.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.760
Is that all you're worried about
is another dream?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.930
It was more than a dream.
It was like a vision,

12:42.963 --> 12:45.232
and it has something to do
with some senators

12:45.265 --> 12:46.800
meeting with you at a hotel--

12:46.834 --> 12:48.001
Well, there you go.

12:48.035 --> 12:49.436
Mitch just went
over our itinerary.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.504
Don't have any
meetings at a hotel.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.672
Nothin' to worry about.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.875
Just-- Please.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.810
Just do it for me then.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.847
We've been talking about going
to see your mother,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.048
so let's go today.

13:01.648 --> 13:02.715
I can't.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.353
She's in a coma.
What good would it do anyway?

13:06.954 --> 13:08.221
We'll talk about this tonight.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.171
She's leaving us.
Get the defibrillator.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.745
What happened?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.148
She's stable.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.552
Get a technician
to check out the equipment.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.321
Yes, ma'am.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.390
We'll let her rest.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.668
Be strong, faithful warrior.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.871
Your prayers are
about to be answered.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
Chloe, come on, babe.
We're late for school.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.390
Mitch, what is it?

14:50.958 --> 14:52.759
I didn't wanna say
anything in front of Aubrey,

14:53.426 --> 14:56.429
but I ran into
an old friend yesterday
that works with Senator Rushton.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.133
Rushton wants blood.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.970
My friend shared
confidential information

15:03.003 --> 15:04.271
on how Rushton and his friends

15:04.304 --> 15:06.306
took out Senator Gibson
five years ago.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.975
The guy
with the insurance scandal?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.409
Well, they found him innocent.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.612
Sure, but the scandal
and other obstacles
of their creation

15:13.313 --> 15:15.182
put a huge blemish
on his political record.

15:15.648 --> 15:16.816
He never recovered.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.286
He lost his senate bid,
lost everything.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.254
They're gonna start
putting pressure

15:21.288 --> 15:22.990
on your financial backers
to drop you

15:23.023 --> 15:24.691
while they look for skeletons
in the closet.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.927
And when they don't find any,
they're gonna make them up.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.698
So you're saying
my political career is over.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.301
It's over as you know it.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.505
-You probably won't get
a second term unless--
-Unless I compromise.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.273
They wanna meet
with you at four.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.042
Stall them.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.610
Let me think about it.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.380
Okay, I'll see you.

16:02.129 --> 16:04.364
We're gonna have to calibrate
the bombs on site.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.498
I'll show you how to do it.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.300
What's the matter?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.204
What if something goes wrong?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.939
We should send the data
to the press now.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.308
We do not let go of
our ace in the hand

16:15.342 --> 16:16.809
-until it's over.
-Until it's over.

16:17.844 --> 16:21.248
Besides, we should be able
to handle a few senators.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.754
You had German food last night.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.889
I thought you hated German food.

16:31.258 --> 16:33.260
-Katie loves it.
-Here we go with this again.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.096
Things are
different this time, okay?

16:36.596 --> 16:39.499
-Right, right.
-Yeah. Third time's a charm.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.202
You guys are ridiculous,
you know that?

16:42.235 --> 16:45.338
Testing, one, two, three.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.175
Are we good?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.222
We're all out of options.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.491
I've got a friend
going over new research

17:04.523 --> 17:05.892
on your mother's condition.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.695
In all honesty,
it doesn't look promising.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.865
-How much time does she have?
-A week, at best.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.768
I'll keep you posted
if her condition changes.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.305
Thanks.

17:37.724 --> 17:41.161
- I've been praying for you.
- Please, Mom.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.996
But my prayers
have been different.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.901
You don't believe,

17:49.836 --> 17:52.839
and I want that for you
more than anything.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.007
I've heard it all before.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.643
I'm gonna be just fine.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.077
Are you?

17:59.112 --> 18:00.079
Jonah,

18:02.014 --> 18:03.150
I'm going home soon.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.353
What do you mean?

18:08.155 --> 18:11.158
I didn't wanna tell you
unless I knew for sure,

18:13.293 --> 18:16.095
but the doctor says
I have pancreatic cancer.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.334
How long do you have?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.504
Two, maybe... maybe four months.

18:26.673 --> 18:27.774
But I'm ready.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.278
Why do you still believe?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.012
Especially now.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.782
Because without God,

18:37.049 --> 18:39.286
life just doesn't make
any sense.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.325
I don't know if you can hear me.

18:47.026 --> 18:47.994
Oh, I miss you.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.635
I need you now more than ever.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.732
Did you finish
that Amherst report?

19:26.599 --> 19:29.269
No, I didn't, I'm sorry.
I'll finish it this afternoon.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.870
Jackie,
the meeting is this Thursday.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.038
I need time to prepare.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.173
All right.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.243
I won't let it happen again.

19:38.245 --> 19:39.879
Senator Richards
on your right.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.682
Ah, speak of the devil.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.217
Meet you guys back
at the office.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.588
Senator Richards.
We were just talking about you.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.757
Senator, how are you?
Good morning.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.525
This is my assistant,
Jane Isner.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.526
Jane, this is--

19:53.560 --> 19:55.362
The elusive
Senator Jonah Thomas.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.663
I'm a huge fan.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.030
Really? How's that?

19:58.298 --> 20:00.800
You speak what's on your mind,
shake things up a bit.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.569
It's a rare trait in DC.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.736
Well, you're too kind.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.372
How can I help you, Senator?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.139
I just need a minute.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.876
I'll let you two chat.
I've gotta make a quick call.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.414
Look, I'm just askin'
for one hour.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.949
-Well, I'm just sayin' no.
-You're new around here.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.451
You could use some friends.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.387
And more importantly, you
don't want some more enemies--

20:20.420 --> 20:23.055
- Senator Rushton.
- There's one for you.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.158
I know Rushton's trying
to get over on ya,

20:26.426 --> 20:28.395
but if you come,
that little meeting

20:28.428 --> 20:29.829
you're supposed to have at four,

20:30.597 --> 20:31.764
problem solved.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.834
So you'll handle Rushton if
I come to your little meeting?

20:35.268 --> 20:36.303
Eleven o'clock.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.405
It'll be private.

20:38.805 --> 20:41.140
Senators McLuster
and Williams will be joining us.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.010
All you have to do
is hear us out.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.578
Williams?

20:45.612 --> 20:47.246
I know you two
have been butting heads.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.616
Richards is putting pressure
on Senator Thomas

20:49.649 --> 20:51.851
to back their cancer vaccine
instead of yours.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.086
If he backs
Richards' vaccine bill,

20:54.120 --> 20:55.555
Jonah will step
right in the middle

20:55.588 --> 20:57.256
of your war with Richards.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.126
That's unfortunate.
We need him on our side.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.629
What do you want me to do?
Talk him out of it?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.100
He's a good guy.
Someone should warn him.

21:08.435 --> 21:11.003
No, it's too late now.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.841
Look, let's just see how this
thing plays out, all right?

21:15.942 --> 21:17.344
Maybe he won't join them.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.812
One hour is all I'm askin'.

21:21.648 --> 21:22.649
One hour.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.817
One hour, excellent.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.686
Look, I have got to run.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.355
Jane will brief you
on the meeting.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.889
It's good to see you, Senator.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.159
He can be persistent.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.562
That's more like annoying.

21:36.496 --> 21:38.798
There you go,
speaking your mind again.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.635
Well, the meeting is at 11
at the Artisan Grand.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.172
You know, if you'd like
I can swing by and pick you up.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.742
Thanks, but I think
I'm gonna go it alone.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.380
One never knows when
a quick exit might be in order.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.982
Well, if you change your mind.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.018
Or if you ever wanna
grab a cup of coffee,

21:59.386 --> 22:01.554
compare notes, give me a call.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.042
Gentlemen, let me
remind you of something.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.446
These men are United States
senators.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.449
That means
this must go by the book.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.918
The hotel's been
undergoing renovation

22:32.885 --> 22:34.887
so this floor
is still sealed off.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.790
Does anybody have any questions?

22:39.726 --> 22:41.728
All right,
let's lock it up tight.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.297
Your guy's not gonna budge
from his convictions.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.667
You're too late.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.901
It's as good as done.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.071
Leave Senator Thomas alone.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.566
So where's my camera
in the hallway?

23:19.832 --> 23:20.767
I'm on it.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.196
I'm sorry to cut this short.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.699
-I appreciate your time.
-Thank you.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.534
-Been a pleasure.
-Thank you.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.770
Hey guys,
I'll be right with you, okay?

23:58.370 --> 23:59.338
Jonah.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.208
What did you do?

24:02.675 --> 24:03.676
What are you talking about?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.612
Rushton canceled
the four o'clock.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.279
They're backing off.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.517
Well, hopefully
it's nothin' I'm gonna regret.

24:20.459 --> 24:21.728
Don't go.

24:23.329 --> 24:24.664
There is another way.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.665
Hey!

24:26.833 --> 24:27.867
Wait.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.837
Why do I
listen to your bad ideas?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.206
Ah, don't worry,
he's not gonna show.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.741
It's a darn good idea,

25:09.441 --> 25:10.910
and yeah, he's gonna show.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.512
- Be sure of that.
- We have a mystery guest.

25:13.846 --> 25:16.182
Life is short.
Have a pastry.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.751
Don't worry,
it was just a bad dream.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.620
Jonah, I am serious.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.154
Is there anything else?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.422
I'm gonna be late
for an appointment.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.925
Chloe and I are spending
some time together,

25:25.958 --> 25:28.595
and we'll be ready
for dinner at six.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.563
All right, sounds good.
Love you.

25:30.597 --> 25:31.731
All right, I love you too.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.805
You wanted to see me?

25:40.139 --> 25:42.308
You're not going to the wire
tapper at the Artisan?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.144
Parker's heading it.
He's the best.
No need to get in the way.

25:45.745 --> 25:46.979
What's the real reason?

25:48.114 --> 25:49.315
Senator Baker.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.584
We've been watching him
for almost three years,

25:51.951 --> 25:53.886
ever since the informant
gave us a lead on him.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.054
He's close to his goal.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.889
Now Baker's office tips us off

25:56.923 --> 25:58.290
on pals he's in bed with?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.592
I find that a point of interest.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.227
What did you find?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.762
Stories from his
staff aren't adding up.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.464
Phone records and correspondence
verify my suspicions.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.837
So you think Baker's settin' up
his old friends for a fall?

26:11.170 --> 26:12.504
I'm close to finding a motive.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.140
Okay.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.275
Keep on the trail.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.344
Keep me in the loop.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.847
He's got some powerful friends.

26:24.851 --> 26:25.918
Here we go.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.491
Zoom in, let's get an ID.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.029
That's Senator Thomas.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.342
Thanks for coming.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.845
We know how valuable
your time is,

26:52.879 --> 26:54.113
so we'll try to be brief.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.848
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.952
-Thank you, sir.
-You bet.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.789
You know Senators
McLuster, Williams.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.323
Please.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.199
Two dollar tip.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.801
That's criminal.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.269
Hey Travis, why don't you
take Katie out?

27:17.303 --> 27:18.705
All right, people,
let's stay focused.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.840
Why the long faces?

27:20.873 --> 27:23.142
Thought we voted to raise
our salaries this year.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.677
-This is a mistake.
-Hey, take it easy.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.978
Sit down, Williams.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.047
Look, we know
you're on the fence

27:28.080 --> 27:30.016
about the Blackburn
Medical Reform Bill,

27:30.049 --> 27:32.184
and we need your support
to move it forward,

27:32.218 --> 27:33.252
to get it passed.

27:34.553 --> 27:36.288
Well, what about Bennett?
He's more inclined to go
your way.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.691
Bennett couldn't convince a man
dying of thirst

27:38.725 --> 27:40.559
to drink a cup of water. No.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.195
Besides, people trust you.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.497
You proved that yesterday.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.900
Washington's
a pretty tough town.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.401
We play by a different set
of rules

27:50.703 --> 27:52.705
and you're gonna need
an ally to survive.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.240
Right now, we need you

27:54.741 --> 27:56.342
and we're willing
to make you an offer.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.445
We can help you get your feet
on solid ground.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.247
You're drowning
in a sea of debt.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.381
We can save you.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.692
You're gonna have to do it.

28:14.894 --> 28:15.928
Hit send.

28:16.628 --> 28:17.797
That'll set the bombs.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.738
Gentlemen,
thanks for your time

28:26.205 --> 28:27.940
but I'm gonna take my chances
out there on my own.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.075
Whoa, whoa.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.843
I think we've, at least,
earned the right

28:30.877 --> 28:32.044
to be heard here.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.713
What we're proposing
is a win-win situation

28:34.747 --> 28:36.382
for everyone, including you.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.417
There's no harm in listening.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.388
All right, let's get going.
We don't have much time.

28:49.261 --> 28:50.963
Dad? Dad, what's wrong?

28:50.997 --> 28:52.765
Get the phone.

29:05.011 --> 29:05.945
Rewind that.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.315
There's a camera on the wall
that wasn't there before.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.284
Look straight ahead, walk.

29:16.823 --> 29:17.756
Stop.

29:18.590 --> 29:19.992
We got two gunmen
in the hallway!

29:20.026 --> 29:21.493
Gilman, Travis, take 'em now!

29:21.527 --> 29:23.062
Freeze!

29:23.095 --> 29:25.297
-FBI!
-Hands, hands where
I can see 'em!

29:25.331 --> 29:26.665
- Wait.
- FBI!

29:26.698 --> 29:27.934
Bring 'em around,
bring 'em around.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.301
Put your hands behind your head.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.436
Hey, what's goin' on here?

29:30.469 --> 29:31.770
Hands behind your head, buddy.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.039
Right there, put 'em back.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.673
Put 'em back.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.275
Hands, hands where
I can see 'em.

29:51.657 --> 29:53.492
On your knees!
Get down.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.294
-What have you done?
-I don't know.
I didn't do anything.

30:06.906 --> 30:08.507
He's got somethin'
in his hand. You see it?

30:08.540 --> 30:10.843
Down on three, two, one.

Peace.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.146
Be still.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.385
Am I dead?

31:27.086 --> 31:28.720
One could say that
you never lived.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.591
-What?
-No.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.393
You are not dead.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.795
We are in the spiritual realm
of the world you know.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.600
There was an explosion that...

31:44.603 --> 31:45.637
How'd I get here?

31:46.005 --> 31:47.239
It took more than
you can imagine

31:47.273 --> 31:48.174
to bring you here.

31:49.008 --> 31:50.276
We tried to warn you.

31:50.809 --> 31:51.944
Am I dreaming?

31:52.178 --> 31:54.613
No, this world is more real
than the one you know.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.515
Well, who are you?

31:57.483 --> 31:58.517
I am Gabriel.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.320
The angel?

32:01.853 --> 32:03.255
And you thought
I was just a myth.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.596
Once they form the barrier,
we cannot escape.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.598
The enemy is in force.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.100
I do not know how
much time we have

32:14.133 --> 32:15.767
as we are in the thick
of a great battle.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.970
Battle, what battle?

32:18.370 --> 32:20.472
I am here to open
your eyes to the truth.

32:21.640 --> 32:24.776
This battle... is for your soul.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.179
They are like hungry lions

32:27.213 --> 32:28.780
out to devour anyone they can.

32:29.715 --> 32:30.716
What are you talkin' about?

32:31.050 --> 32:32.018
They are the enemy,

32:32.684 --> 32:35.121
followers of the fallen star,
Satan.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.156
Do not be deceived.

32:37.889 --> 32:40.259
They are superior
in intelligence, clever,

32:40.292 --> 32:41.527
and can take on any form.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.163
Do you want to know the truth?

32:46.698 --> 32:47.666
Then take my hand.

32:55.007 --> 32:56.408
-Who are they?
-Friends.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.698
I-- I can't move.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.168
We gotta go.

33:23.502 --> 33:24.503
Come on.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.136
I could be dead right now.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.571
Did you have anything
to do with this?

33:59.605 --> 34:01.507
It was a wiretap. That's all--

34:01.540 --> 34:02.774
You were wiretapping the room?

34:02.808 --> 34:04.510
When were you gonna fill me
in on that?

34:04.543 --> 34:05.777
Look, let's get together.

34:06.312 --> 34:07.446
I can clear this up.

34:07.979 --> 34:11.382
None of those men
deserved to die.

34:11.650 --> 34:12.751
Jane, listen to me.

34:13.085 --> 34:14.420
Jane. Jane?

34:18.090 --> 34:20.126
Breaching FBI database.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.120
This is the reckoning pool.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.490
It represents the
words, thoughts,

35:24.523 --> 35:26.392
and actions of anyone
that has ever lived,

35:27.226 --> 35:28.327
and lives today.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.242
Follow me.

35:48.980 --> 35:49.915
You can trust me.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.028
Is this really water?

36:03.495 --> 36:04.363
Yes.

36:17.876 --> 36:18.844
Look closely.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.217
Didn't I tell you not
to play in the garage?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.519
I'm sorry, Dad,
I didn't mean to.

36:27.553 --> 36:28.920
Please, I'm sorry.

36:28.954 --> 36:30.956
There was 200 dollars' worth
of paint and supplies.

36:31.390 --> 36:32.591
Dad.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.626
You are absolutely worthless,
you know that?

36:35.361 --> 36:37.429
Who's gonna pay
for all this, you?

36:38.297 --> 36:39.398
Worthless.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.246
Each word and action,
both good and bad,

36:55.213 --> 36:56.548
ripples throughout eternity.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.250
Your father never knew

36:58.284 --> 36:59.951
how his rage would
affect your life

37:00.452 --> 37:02.688
and the lives of countless
others, including his own.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.290
I could never please my father,

37:04.823 --> 37:06.392
no matter how hard I tried.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.426
But that's not true.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.995
Your father loved you very much.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.064
He even bragged about you
to friends and loved ones.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.502
He just never knew
how to show his love.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.305
I have revealed this to you

37:19.338 --> 37:21.172
so you can remember the
pain of ill-chosen words.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.642
I vowed to never treat
my daughter that way.

37:24.310 --> 37:27.012
But you have, even today.

37:31.850 --> 37:32.951
What? Today?

37:34.252 --> 37:36.655
Hold on. Well, what time?
Two o'clock?

37:37.489 --> 37:38.590
Yeah, no problem.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.326
I don't have anything
important scheduled at two.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.560
I can make that, no problem.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.994
He always lies to me,

37:43.028 --> 37:45.163
and he doesn't care
about anything I do.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.767
I wish he were dead.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.379
You're okay.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.981
Come on, I got ya.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.316
I got ya, come on, let's go.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.238
I need a phone.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.190
Come on.

38:53.231 --> 38:54.165
Quiet.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.611
Gilman to Parker.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.580
-Yeah, Gilman, come in.
-Travis is dead.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.782
In pursuit of suspects
at north end of stairwell.

39:11.450 --> 39:13.051
Suspects are entering
the 48th floor.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.554
Roger, Gilman, 48th floor.
We copy.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.224
Okay, Mills is gonna cover
the south stairwell.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.793
Do not pursue
until he's in position.

39:25.564 --> 39:26.532
Acknowledge.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.584
Come on.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.886
This way.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.292
FBI Database accessed.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.481
I'm impressed.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.783
- How did you do this?
- Do what?

40:23.689 --> 40:25.023
Firewall breached.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.828
Bobby, I'm getting
a delayed transmission.

40:31.329 --> 40:32.664
Pull this up on your screen.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.601
I wanna trace the source on it.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.039
I want to show you something.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.374
I've seen enough.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.394
I notice how people
gravitate towards you.

41:04.630 --> 41:05.731
You're a natural leader.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.700
Your mom and I have decided

41:08.734 --> 41:10.502
to send you to a special
leadership training camp

41:10.536 --> 41:11.537
for a couple weeks.

41:11.803 --> 41:12.871
They don't take just anybody,

41:12.904 --> 41:13.972
but after talking to them

41:14.005 --> 41:15.206
they've decided to take you.

41:17.743 --> 41:19.077
Son, you have a wonderful gift.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.179
You need to learn how to use it.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.896
That was one of the best days
of my life,

41:38.864 --> 41:41.066
one of the few times
my father made me feel special.

41:41.667 --> 41:42.868
Those words and actions

41:43.368 --> 41:44.870
pushed your life in
a positive direction.

41:45.604 --> 41:48.907
So all my words and actions
are stored here?

41:49.274 --> 41:52.410
Everyone that has ever lived,
who lives today.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.280
Nothing is hidden,

41:55.681 --> 41:57.549
and one day all things
will be revealed.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.052
Time in your world is but
a vapor in the eyes of eternity.

42:02.087 --> 42:06.391
Your kind chase after shadows,
selfish ambition.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.393
It's meaningless
in the eyes of God.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.863
There's been a huge explosion.

42:12.798 --> 42:15.366
We need immediate backup
and medical assistance.

42:16.201 --> 42:18.269
Suspects are on the 48th floor.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.072
Agents Gilman and Mills
in pursuit.

42:21.106 --> 42:23.241
Secure the floor
and lock down the hotel.

42:23.575 --> 42:24.810
Backup is on the way.

42:28.213 --> 42:30.415
System security
has been breached.

42:30.448 --> 42:31.783
Okay, hello.
How did you get in?

42:31.817 --> 42:33.785
Give me that source. You got it?

42:34.886 --> 42:37.055
-Hey, buddy.
-Hello, Colt.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.557
If you're watching--
if you're watching this,

42:41.593 --> 42:42.728
I'm probably dead.

42:42.761 --> 42:44.195
I just sent over the package

42:44.229 --> 42:45.463
with the data
I've been collecting

42:45.496 --> 42:46.632
for the last couple months

42:47.265 --> 42:49.000
of the so called cancer vaccine.

42:49.267 --> 42:51.269
Just make sure the information
gets out.

42:51.937 --> 42:53.605
It's important
that people see this.

42:55.607 --> 42:56.474
All right, buddy.

42:58.009 --> 42:59.244
See ya some other time.

42:59.645 --> 43:01.647
Colt, what did you do?

43:03.815 --> 43:05.283
Dad. Dad!

43:07.819 --> 43:08.920
I can make it.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.022
-We have to go back.
-Why?

43:11.857 --> 43:14.092
If we're still alive,
they might still be alive.

43:14.626 --> 43:16.762
I wanna die knowing
that I finished the job.

43:26.972 --> 43:28.039
Look closely.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.579
This morning, Senator Williams

43:34.612 --> 43:37.182
made his last adjustments
to his financial portfolio.

43:37.883 --> 43:39.284
He accumulated more wealth

43:39.317 --> 43:40.819
than most people
could ever imagine,

43:41.452 --> 43:44.122
some honestly, and some
through ill-gotten gains.

43:45.390 --> 43:46.858
But he was very generous.

43:48.660 --> 43:51.229
But God knows the motives
and actions of the heart.

43:51.897 --> 43:54.499
Williams, like many,
hoped in the end

43:54.532 --> 43:56.968
that his good deeds
would cover his sins

43:57.002 --> 43:58.369
and buy his way into heaven.

43:59.404 --> 44:01.339
Senator Richards
took a different path

44:01.372 --> 44:03.141
to fulfill his
desire for purpose,

44:04.843 --> 44:06.211
the lusts of the flesh.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.048
Straight.

44:11.116 --> 44:12.150
Sin has
its season of pleasure,

44:13.251 --> 44:14.820
but there is always a price.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.056
Richards needed the deal

44:18.089 --> 44:20.491
to pay off the hush money
for his many transgressions.

44:27.032 --> 44:28.900
Power
was Senator McLuster's path.

44:30.335 --> 44:32.370
He wanted it over
his constituents.

44:33.271 --> 44:35.106
He wanted power over
his fellow senators.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.075
- I got that.
- You got it?

44:37.909 --> 44:39.845
He wanted power
over the nation.

44:40.746 --> 44:42.714
Like most, they never sought God

44:42.748 --> 44:43.849
for their true purpose.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.517
They missed out on the path
that God prepared for them.

44:46.952 --> 44:48.754
Now they will stand before Him

44:48.787 --> 44:50.255
and give an account
for their lives.

45:07.105 --> 45:08.273
McLuster's dead.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.971
I promise you,
I'm gonna finish this.

46:05.864 --> 46:07.465
Where are the senators now?

46:08.333 --> 46:09.367
Are you sayin' they're dead?

46:10.001 --> 46:11.502
I will show you in due time.

46:22.814 --> 46:24.182
Do you recognize anyone?

46:26.484 --> 46:27.953
No, should I?

46:28.186 --> 46:30.021
Aren't you supposed to be a man
of the people?

46:30.856 --> 46:31.990
Well, how can you expect me

46:32.023 --> 46:33.191
to know any of these people?

46:33.691 --> 46:34.993
Do you know
your next door neighbor?

46:36.327 --> 46:37.295
Yeah.

46:38.529 --> 46:39.730
Clayton and Martha.

46:40.298 --> 46:41.166
Really?

46:42.133 --> 46:43.301
When's the last time
you spoke with Clayton?

46:48.306 --> 46:50.041
If your son pleads guilty,

46:50.075 --> 46:51.442
the state has agreed to give him

46:51.476 --> 46:54.212
two years in jail plus rehab.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.414
He's only 19.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.050
We are paying
you a ton of money

46:59.084 --> 47:00.485
because we heard
you were the best,

47:01.252 --> 47:03.021
that you could get
our son out of this mess,

47:03.889 --> 47:04.990
and now you're telling us

47:05.023 --> 47:06.424
you can't get him
probation and rehab?

47:06.724 --> 47:09.027
He broke an officer's jaw
during the arrest

47:09.060 --> 47:11.029
and he was in
possession of a handgun.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.263
That changes everything.

47:12.730 --> 47:14.065
Two years is a gift,

47:14.099 --> 47:15.833
especially with this judge.

47:18.269 --> 47:19.370
Martha.

47:20.605 --> 47:22.673
You've been
extremely hard on Jackie,

47:23.241 --> 47:25.676
even wondering how you
could replace her with Jane,

47:25.710 --> 47:27.012
who you met just this morning.

47:27.946 --> 47:29.614
Jackie has been faithful to you.

47:29.948 --> 47:31.416
She does the work
of two staff members

47:31.449 --> 47:33.684
even though you promised
to lighten the load.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.788
Did you know that her husband
left her and their son?

47:39.190 --> 47:40.691
Her dreams of love, shattered.

47:44.295 --> 47:46.531
She wonders how she's going
to raise her son

47:46.564 --> 47:47.698
and pay the bills.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.470
Aubrey is wondering
the same thing of you.

47:56.807 --> 47:57.909
She feels alone,

47:59.244 --> 48:00.745
as if you've already left her.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.749
She thought you were
going to be there for her

48:04.782 --> 48:06.918
-as a husband...
-I need some time to think.

48:06.952 --> 48:08.219
...and a father.

48:17.728 --> 48:20.265
I know that Aubrey
and Chloe are having
a tough time right now.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.833
The first two years are
the hardest on the Hill.

48:26.337 --> 48:27.572
What are you, judging me?

48:28.306 --> 48:30.575
Unfortunately,
my responsibilities
to help people

48:30.608 --> 48:31.809
take a lot of my time.

48:34.512 --> 48:36.647
I'm just trying to open
your eyes to the truth.

48:56.034 --> 48:57.435
Your wife knew
you were in a hurry

48:57.468 --> 48:59.537
so she took the liberty
of ordering your favorite.

49:01.672 --> 49:03.174
Sorry, honey, I
had to take a call.

49:05.977 --> 49:07.912
Good news, we can celebrate

49:07.945 --> 49:10.515
the passing of the Baker
Medical Reform Bill in style.

49:10.982 --> 49:13.351
I've made reservations
at our favorite place in Aspen.

49:14.219 --> 49:15.220
Are you okay?

49:16.287 --> 49:18.023
Where is Aubrey and Chloe?

49:18.789 --> 49:19.790
They're in Austin.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.361
Sorry I'm late.

49:23.394 --> 49:25.230
The traffic was heavy.

49:27.232 --> 49:29.300
- She's responsive?
- It took a small miracle.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.902
She's weak, but she's...
she's improving.

49:32.237 --> 49:33.371
She's not out of the woods

49:33.404 --> 49:34.739
but her vitals are improving.

49:35.006 --> 49:36.474
I'll give you some time alone.

49:36.741 --> 49:38.143
Try not to keep her up too long.

49:38.743 --> 49:39.744
Grandma!

49:41.079 --> 49:42.013
Hi.

49:44.915 --> 49:46.717
Oh, thank God you're back!

49:46.751 --> 49:47.752
Thank God.

49:53.558 --> 49:55.160
I'm happy to see my girls.

49:58.196 --> 50:00.465
Mom, I think Jonah's
having a relapse

50:00.498 --> 50:01.899
from the explosion.

50:01.932 --> 50:04.535
The doctor said
he may experience

50:04.569 --> 50:06.471
some forms of amnesia.

50:06.504 --> 50:07.805
Honey, you're gonna be fine.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.240
I'm gonna give the
doctor a quick call.

50:09.274 --> 50:10.408
I'll just be a second.

50:11.076 --> 50:12.077
Uh...

50:12.610 --> 50:14.745
I am so glad you found Jane.

50:15.180 --> 50:17.948
Divorcing Aubrey
was the right thing to do.

50:18.683 --> 50:21.719
She was just too demanding.

50:22.787 --> 50:25.423
This one is your true soul mate.

50:26.124 --> 50:28.426
I thought you loved Aubrey
and were against divorce.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.597
Well, I've learned
from recent experience

50:32.630 --> 50:36.033
that God wants us to be happy.

50:36.801 --> 50:40.638
He wants us to live
life to the fullest.

50:41.606 --> 50:43.574
Jane and the Medical Reform Bill

50:43.608 --> 50:45.910
has allowed you
to truly be happy.

50:47.378 --> 50:48.813
Jonah, it's the demon!

50:57.822 --> 50:58.723
Gabriel.

51:00.658 --> 51:01.559
Daegon.

51:02.427 --> 51:03.594
Yes, my prince.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.130
We need more reinforcements.

51:05.496 --> 51:08.466
Don't let Gabriel break
our defenses again.

51:14.004 --> 51:16.107
Track them.

51:24.182 --> 51:25.250
What just happened?

51:25.650 --> 51:26.817
That was not your mother.

51:27.318 --> 51:29.687
It was Magog, a powerful demon
among the enemy.

51:30.255 --> 51:31.489
They seemed so real.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.825
The enemy presented a lie
that could one day be real.

51:35.526 --> 51:36.661
No.

51:36.961 --> 51:39.497
No, I would never leave my wife
and daughter for her,

51:39.530 --> 51:40.831
or for anyone for that matter.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.000
You've already succumbed to
the temptations in your heart.

51:44.169 --> 51:46.371
The truth can reveal
the darkest parts of one's life,

51:47.004 --> 51:49.006
things you don't wanna
believe about yourself.

51:51.876 --> 51:54.145
-So you can read my thoughts?
-No.

51:55.213 --> 51:56.547
Our abilities are limited.

51:57.315 --> 51:58.683
However, God has no limits

51:59.517 --> 52:01.118
and He's allowed me
a glimpse of your heart.

52:06.056 --> 52:07.625
All right, I might be tempted,

52:07.658 --> 52:09.026
but I would never leave my wife.

52:09.827 --> 52:11.229
Your confidence betrays you.

52:11.896 --> 52:13.431
The enemy will take
you down a path

52:13.464 --> 52:14.799
that will leave
your life in ruins

52:15.166 --> 52:17.302
and one step closer
to accomplishing their mission.

52:18.068 --> 52:19.204
And what would that be?

52:19.570 --> 52:22.173
To destroy your marriage,
your life,

52:22.207 --> 52:23.574
and as many lives as they can.

52:25.876 --> 52:26.744
No.

52:27.678 --> 52:28.546
I...

52:29.680 --> 52:31.148
I don't know how to explain it.

52:31.416 --> 52:33.718
I think that Jonah is
in some kind of trouble.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.353
He is.

52:36.787 --> 52:37.955
May be concerned
for their loved ones

52:37.988 --> 52:40.157
working at the hotel,
but they are keeping us updated

52:40.191 --> 52:41.759
-on the situation.
-He's there.

52:42.026 --> 52:43.861
Once again,
police now believe

52:43.894 --> 52:45.563
that both explosions
were deliberate

52:46.163 --> 52:48.333
and they have confirmed
that there were people

52:48.366 --> 52:51.035
on the floors where
the explosions occurred.

52:51.068 --> 52:54.004
- Oh no!
We don't know
if there are any injuries...

52:54.038 --> 52:55.573
It's my fault, isn't it?

52:57.007 --> 52:57.908
Oh no.

53:00.445 --> 53:02.880
I didn't mean to say
that I wanted Dad to die.

53:03.881 --> 53:05.049
Honey, I know you didn't.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.552
And God knows you
didn't mean it.

53:07.585 --> 53:09.720
...all the streets within a mile
of the hotel,

53:09.754 --> 53:11.589
and only authorized personnel

53:11.622 --> 53:14.191
are allowed near and in
the building at this time--

53:14.225 --> 53:15.293
I gotta go.

53:16.227 --> 53:18.095
Aubrey, Aubrey.

53:18.629 --> 53:19.797
It won't do any good.

53:21.266 --> 53:23.234
But this had something
to do with my dream.
There's gotta be a reason.

53:24.201 --> 53:27.438
God sent the dream
to warn Jonah.

53:28.072 --> 53:31.909
The battle he's facing
isn't against flesh and blood.

53:34.279 --> 53:35.913
I am not a part of your war.

53:38.115 --> 53:39.617
How do I know that
you're not lying?

53:40.785 --> 53:42.219
'Cause you still know
in your heart

53:42.253 --> 53:43.921
that the path the enemy
has presented to you

53:44.221 --> 53:45.790
would leave your life in misery.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.727
Love sees you
as something beautiful,

53:50.828 --> 53:52.229
a prize worthy of dying for.

54:10.247 --> 54:11.115
Run!

54:35.039 --> 54:36.106
He's alive.

55:16.180 --> 55:17.181
Wha...

55:17.648 --> 55:18.749
What was that?

55:22.052 --> 55:23.320
Grena--

55:44.609 --> 55:46.744
You all right?

55:47.512 --> 55:48.579
You still with us?

55:49.614 --> 55:51.416
I heard ever since
that explosion

55:51.449 --> 55:54.218
you have trouble
concentrating now and then.

55:56.086 --> 55:57.221
Would you like a drink?

55:59.023 --> 56:01.258
No. No, thank you.

56:02.059 --> 56:04.228
Well, you sure look
like you could use one.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.966
That explosion
was a terrible tragedy.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.235
I didn't know that you were

56:11.268 --> 56:13.370
in that little meeting
there with Senator Richards.

56:14.572 --> 56:17.442
To be truthful, you got greedy.

56:19.243 --> 56:20.911
Started maneuvering
behind my back.

56:21.245 --> 56:22.613
I had to make arrangements.

56:23.047 --> 56:24.381
You were behind the bombing?

56:24.415 --> 56:27.485
No, no, my plan was get
the FBI to investigate 'em,

56:27.918 --> 56:30.054
expose him, get
him out of office,

56:30.455 --> 56:31.489
get him outta my hair.

56:31.956 --> 56:35.626
But as fate would have it,
those two lunatics...

56:37.495 --> 56:40.631
well, as they say,
it's an ill wind

56:40.665 --> 56:42.500
that doesn't blow
somebody some good.

56:43.634 --> 56:46.003
You were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

56:59.584 --> 57:00.951
Senator Richards was wise

57:00.985 --> 57:02.687
to bring you in on
his little deal.

57:03.921 --> 57:04.989
People like you.

57:05.790 --> 57:06.857
You get things done.

57:07.958 --> 57:10.260
Nobody would have suspected
a thing.

57:10.828 --> 57:13.097
I listened
to those FBI wire tapes.

57:13.864 --> 57:15.365
You didn't have a chance
to join them.

57:17.334 --> 57:18.503
But you can join me.

57:39.990 --> 57:41.859
My plan
may seem a little bit radical

57:41.892 --> 57:44.294
in that it mandates
certain advances,

57:45.329 --> 57:48.198
one being that the vaccine
is clinically proven

57:48.566 --> 57:49.967
to eradicate cancer.

57:53.037 --> 57:54.672
Your mother has cancer,
doesn't she?

57:57.407 --> 57:59.043
No more deaths from cancer.

58:00.545 --> 58:04.048
Not to mention the billions,
and billions of dollars

58:04.081 --> 58:05.750
we would save
the American public.

58:08.352 --> 58:10.555
My guess is you get a cut
of each vaccine.

58:14.892 --> 58:18.062
If you help me,
I will personally see to it

58:18.095 --> 58:19.396
that you move up in class.

58:20.898 --> 58:24.669
I'm talkin' about real power,
real wealth.

58:25.770 --> 58:27.204
What do you want me to do?

58:28.405 --> 58:30.307
Nothin' that nobody else
wouldn't do,

58:30.340 --> 58:32.376
or hasn't done, for that matter.

58:33.110 --> 58:35.012
Sounds like you want me
to break the law.

58:36.246 --> 58:37.882
Just look the other way.

58:38.916 --> 58:41.118
All your problems
will be behind you

58:41.418 --> 58:43.588
and the good life
in front of you.

59:23.427 --> 59:24.962
Do you believe in God, senator?

59:29.233 --> 59:30.234
God?

59:32.169 --> 59:35.773
Look, our scientists have proven

59:35.806 --> 59:39.309
beyond a doubt that
now in this day and age

59:39.343 --> 59:41.345
we have no need for a god.

59:42.980 --> 59:44.982
Now that's a fact.
You can bank on that.

59:45.850 --> 59:48.152
But I do believe
in positive energy

59:48.185 --> 59:49.319
bringing two people together,

59:49.787 --> 59:51.588
you and me here together today

59:51.989 --> 59:53.958
to do something
for the good of mankind.

59:54.458 --> 59:55.459
Hm?

59:56.426 --> 59:59.930
You have a chance to be a hero

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.266
in this brave new world.

01:00:11.208 --> 01:00:12.442
What is going on?

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.178
I want some answers.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:17.047
They are searching
for each weakness in your heart

01:00:17.815 --> 01:00:19.083
so they can tempt you

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.517
into helping sign
Baker's Medical Reform Bill,

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.720
which will require the people
to take the vaccine.

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:25.790
The vaccine only appears
to work for a few months

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.525
and then the cancer will
return with a vengeance,

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:30.861
killing thousands, and millions
upon millions of people

01:00:30.895 --> 01:00:32.730
will suffer a pain
beyond human comprehension,

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:34.564
a pain that cannot be stopped.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:39.336
If that's true, why didn't you
tell me that earlier?

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:42.639
It is my hope that one day
you won't need me to
tell you anything,

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.409
that you'll be guided
by the greatest of powers.

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:47.144
What power?

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:50.347
Let me show you.

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:55.019
Hey Pam.

01:00:55.252 --> 01:00:56.520
Keep this within the agency.

01:00:56.553 --> 01:00:58.155
Don't talk to anyone
on the outside

01:00:58.188 --> 01:01:00.257
without passing it by me first,
is that clear?

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:01.892
All right.

01:01:01.926 --> 01:01:03.193
Got somethin' you have to see.

01:01:04.628 --> 01:01:06.330
An old friend
of mine, Colt Lesher,
is behind the bombing.

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:08.565
Actually, the best
that we can determine

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.000
is that Colt and his father,

01:01:10.034 --> 01:01:12.069
they ran into our agents
in the lobby of the hotel.

01:01:12.102 --> 01:01:14.038
Forcing them to prematurely
detonate the bomb

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:16.573
using a cell phone,
and at the same time

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.844
sending me a ton of data.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:21.078
So what's in the data?

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:22.612
Actually,
some pretty damning evidence

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.215
against the Blackburn
Medical Reform Bill.

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:27.752
The bill that Requires everyone
to take a cancer vaccine.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:30.687
Known in the medical
world as RZZ989.

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.523
It's getting tons of buzz
in the medical journals.

01:01:34.191 --> 01:01:35.359
Baker was on to them.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:36.861
Oh, he was more than on to them.

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:38.863
Baker's been gearing up
a cancer vaccine of his own.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.232
Richards' group
is Baker's competition.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.103
Baker was using our wire tap
to clear the playing field.

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:49.073
But if the reaction
is that painful,

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:51.742
how is Colt's father
even able to walk?

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:53.710
Ex-Navy SEAL.

01:01:54.812 --> 01:01:56.080
Toughest guy I ever met.

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:13.397
Each day, thousands
and thousands of people

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.966
from all over the world,
from all races,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.234
from all walks of life,

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.703
they were born into
the bondage of sin

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.772
which they cannot
break free from on their own.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:24.574
They can neither see,
nor feel their shackle

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.244
because the Evil One
has placed a veil

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.179
over their eyes,
blinding them from the truth,

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:32.249
the truth that loves them
and longs to set them free.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:35.652
There are many that
have surrendered

01:02:35.685 --> 01:02:37.154
to the light of this world,

01:02:38.188 --> 01:02:40.624
the light of Jesus that
leads you beyond the darkness

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:47.031
that can open their eyes
to the truth.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:56.473
A light that can free them
from the shackles of sin

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.809
and give them the
gift of eternal life.

01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:06.951
God is about relationships.

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.553
He wants us to walk in His light
and know His love

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:13.290
so that we can truly
love Him and others.

01:03:14.959 --> 01:03:17.561
So what about those people
who die without
accepting His love?

01:03:18.195 --> 01:03:20.330
God sends 'em to hell?
What kind of a love is that?

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.933
But why would
Colt and his father

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:24.902
want to kill Richards
and the other senators?

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.803
And where did
he get all that data?

01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:30.140
Short version, Colt's father
has stage-4 bone cancer.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.010
Freid Pharmaceuticals
creates RZZ.

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.145
Colt's a big-time at Freid,

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:37.247
so he finagles a sample
of the vaccine for his dad

01:03:37.514 --> 01:03:39.049
and it lives up to the hype.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.321
He's cancer-free in three weeks.

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:50.360
Four months later,
the cancer came back.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:55.832
Colt hacked his way
into the research
department's database...

01:03:57.701 --> 01:03:59.036
discovered a major coverup

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.371
by Senators Hear-No-Evil,
See-No-Evil,

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.539
and Speak-Plenty-Of-Evil.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.875
The vaccine slash drug,

01:04:04.909 --> 01:04:08.345
it works miracles
in 95 percent of test groups.

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:10.780
In the remaining 5 percent,
the cancer growth slows

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:13.217
but somehow
their central nervous system

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.352
comes completely under attack.

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.655
Imagine third-degree burns
all over your body

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:19.856
with no sign of relief.

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.927
It literally
was driving patients insane.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.396
What else have you got?

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.865
Apparently, our senators
falsified the data.

01:04:32.136 --> 01:04:33.904
Millions of lives
could be at risk.

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.404
It is appointed
for all to die once

01:05:08.672 --> 01:05:09.906
and then receive judgment.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:11.976
That includes you.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:21.585
Each person, great and small,

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.852
will stand before God.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:27.791
Their words, thoughts,
and deeds will be judged.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.116
Everyone whose name
is not in the Book of Life

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.785
will be cast
into the lake of fire.

01:06:41.098 --> 01:06:42.566
Help us!

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.068
Please!

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:45.935
Help us!

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.737
Do something!

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:49.606
Why aren't you helping them?

01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:53.543
They've sealed their own fate.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:56.413
There's nothing
we can do for them now.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:23.240
I can feel the pain, and agony.

01:07:25.742 --> 01:07:27.711
You were allowed to experience
a mere fraction

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:29.646
of their eternal torment.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.650
So this loving
God created a hell?

01:07:35.752 --> 01:07:36.953
Why doesn't God do anything

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.089
about the evil and the suffering
in the world?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:44.461
If He truly cares,
if He is a God of love

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.230
he would've done
something by now!

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:48.332
He hasn't done anything!

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.640
You were allowed
to feel an ounce

01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:35.712
of Love's agony, rejection,
and pain at the cross.

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:39.683
Jesus paid the great price

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:42.786
for the sins of this world,
your sins,

01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:46.189
so that whosoever believes
in Him

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:49.225
shall not perish,
but will have everlasting life.

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:14.584
The question you should be
asking yourself is...

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:23.327
why would anyone
reject the love of Jesus?

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.118
Run! They're coming!

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:07.471
Jonah, behind you!
No!

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:20.784
Jonah,

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.052
my son.

01:10:31.328 --> 01:10:32.296
Mother?

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.299
The best thing
that we can do for Jonah

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:37.000
is to pray.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:55.151
Dear heavenly Father,
please protect Jonah.

01:10:57.654 --> 01:11:00.590
We know that he is
in grave danger,

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:04.494
but we also know
that You are stronger

01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:07.030
than anything that he can face.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.368
Colt's father
only has a month to live.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:13.169
That vaccine is brutal.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.104
Does Baker's vaccine even work?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.006
That's just it, we don't know.

01:11:17.341 --> 01:11:19.175
I mean, Colt was digging.

01:11:19.843 --> 01:11:21.978
How come
Colt didn't come to you first,

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.279
let us deal with it?

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:24.314
According to the notes,

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:25.849
Colt and his father thought

01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:28.385
the senators were just
gonna get a slap on the wrist.

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:30.320
They wanted revenge.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.193
It's the lap dog.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.401
There is no escape.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:20.236
Why are you so interested
in this one?

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:24.374
The question is, why do you
bother with any of them?

01:12:25.108 --> 01:12:30.113
They're weak, unfaithful,
so easy to deceive.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:37.421
And yet He favors them more
than me, more than you.

01:12:38.555 --> 01:12:40.424
It is you that is unfaithful,

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:42.926
and so easily deceived
to believe

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:44.628
that you and your master
could defeat God.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:47.096
Love for them,
that's His weakness.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:52.936
And that is why we
will be victorious in the end.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:57.941
You can still join us,
my brother.

01:12:58.442 --> 01:13:01.445
Still under the deception
that you're going to win,

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:04.448
liars believing the lie.

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:09.318
If you change your mind,
call out my name.

01:13:09.986 --> 01:13:13.056
Maybe I'll come and save you.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.792
Now I've got a war to win.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:18.161
Finish him.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:21.064
With pleasure.

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:38.515
My son.

01:13:40.517 --> 01:13:42.018
You look so young.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:46.155
We are ageless in this world.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:50.694
Why are you troubled?

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:54.163
I've seen so many things.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:58.101
I, too, have seen many wonders
since I've been here.

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:00.236
It's like my eyes
have been opened

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.370
for the first time.

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.540
What do you mean?

01:14:04.474 --> 01:14:05.809
I was closed-minded before.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:10.146
I now know that hell was a myth
created by a man

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:12.281
to control men through fear.

01:14:13.116 --> 01:14:14.450
God is love.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:16.620
He forgives all.

01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:28.031
You're free to choose
your own path

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:29.232
at your own will.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.469
So you no longer
believe in Jesus?

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.573
I'm afraid that my time
in this world

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:38.742
is coming to an end.

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:41.044
I can hear heaven's call.

01:14:42.045 --> 01:14:43.713
Let's experience heaven
together.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:56.660
No.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:15:01.430
No. I saw the cross.

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:05.334
Yet you still question,
as you should.

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:08.104
You don't believe.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:37.533
Leave him!

01:15:56.119 --> 01:15:57.754
Call upon Prince Magog's name

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.288
and you will be spared.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:02.659
Last chance!

01:16:05.795 --> 01:16:06.896
Never!

01:16:48.672 --> 01:16:49.605
What's happening?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.141
They're creating a barrier.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:53.877
They're coming.

01:17:06.322 --> 01:17:07.190
What's this?

01:17:08.057 --> 01:17:09.025
Your sins.

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:11.828
You're dying.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:15.631
They're here.

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:17.801
I'll find you
on the other side of the river.

01:17:24.908 --> 01:17:26.475
Oh, dear Lord...

01:17:29.679 --> 01:17:32.148
use this time to
open up his eyes,

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.651
to have him accept
the gift of life

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:37.320
through Jesus Christ, Your Son.

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:12.521
No!

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:06.135
You're worthless!

01:20:11.074 --> 01:20:12.808
You know
you don't deserve mercy,

01:20:13.476 --> 01:20:14.844
and you're never gonna get it.

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:43.239
You're a miserable father
and a terrible husband!

01:20:44.173 --> 01:20:45.441
Your father's right.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:48.912
You're worthless.

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:52.748
I know you don't love me.

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:54.583
You always lie to me.

01:20:57.753 --> 01:20:59.788
I am here to open
your eyes to the truth,

01:21:00.556 --> 01:21:02.058
the truth that
will set you free.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:31.754
You were never there for me.

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:36.392
I wish you were never born.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:40.296
Love sees you as
something beautiful,

01:21:41.797 --> 01:21:43.299
a prize worthy of dying for.

01:21:46.469 --> 01:21:47.503
We deserve better.

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:51.674
I hate you!

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:55.411
Jesus paid the great price

01:21:55.444 --> 01:21:58.247
for the sins of this world,
your sins.

01:21:59.782 --> 01:22:01.484
You know you don't deserve mercy

01:22:02.285 --> 01:22:03.619
and you're never gonna get it.

01:22:04.353 --> 01:22:05.488
Your father's right.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:07.023
You are worthless.

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:32.508
God,

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:37.246
please help me.

01:24:08.811 --> 01:24:10.446
I know I don't deserve
Your love.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:29.565
Jesus.

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:44.580
Forgive my sins.

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:49.852
I give my life to You.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.065
Why did I wait so long?

01:26:11.234 --> 01:26:12.268
Come with me,

01:26:13.436 --> 01:26:14.670
child of the living God.

01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:20.509
My leg.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.447
Your leg will never recover
in your world.

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:27.583
But know that
you are born again,

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:29.852
and that you have new life.

01:26:58.314 --> 01:26:59.482
Chloe, get the doctor.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:00.716
No.

01:27:03.085 --> 01:27:04.420
It's gonna be okay.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:11.059
It's time.

01:27:12.127 --> 01:27:13.061
Not now.

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:16.499
Grandma, please.

01:27:19.502 --> 01:27:22.237
Just don't lose faith,

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.074
no matter how hard life gets.

01:27:27.643 --> 01:27:31.347
Tell Jonah my life
is just about to begin.

01:28:01.544 --> 01:28:04.347
The angels rejoice over
each sinner that repents.

01:28:08.484 --> 01:28:10.653
That's the fragrance
of Jesus in you.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:13.155
You once had the stench of death

01:28:13.489 --> 01:28:14.890
but now you have
the scent of life.

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:17.393
I don't deserve any of this.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.396
God's love knows no boundaries.

01:28:28.236 --> 01:28:29.237
What do I do now?

01:28:30.406 --> 01:28:31.807
The Holy Spirit will guide you

01:28:33.141 --> 01:28:34.977
as you taste the goodness
of God's word

01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:36.579
and walk in the light of Jesus.

01:28:51.494 --> 01:28:52.395
Sir.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.831
Sir. Can you hear me?

01:28:58.601 --> 01:28:59.702
Sir, can you hear me?

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.238
We're gonna put you
on the stretcher
so try not to move.

01:29:10.413 --> 01:29:12.347
Does your neck hurt?

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:29.432
Death is not the end,

01:29:30.232 --> 01:29:32.435
but a passage into the eternal.

01:29:58.461 --> 01:30:00.395
Oh! What is this?

01:30:00.963 --> 01:30:02.130
Well, you deserve it.

01:30:02.465 --> 01:30:04.132
Why don't you take the rest
of the day off

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.934
and have a nice long weekend
with that son of yours.

01:30:07.636 --> 01:30:08.504
Thank you!

01:30:14.643 --> 01:30:16.712
Every desire, every motive

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:18.246
ripples throughout eternity

01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:20.649
and will be judged in the light
of the Righteous One.

01:30:48.611 --> 01:30:52.347
This world is fading,
along with everything it craves.

01:30:54.717 --> 01:30:57.119
God's love reaches out
to each heart

01:30:57.152 --> 01:30:58.954
to walk with Him
and receive the gift

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:01.724
of His salvation,
rest, and peace.

01:31:03.726 --> 01:31:05.227
Yet many ignore His call.

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:14.136
But for those who do the will
of God,

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:16.471
they will one day
have every tear

01:31:16.505 --> 01:31:18.306
and every sorrow wiped away,

01:31:19.007 --> 01:31:20.275
and they will live forever

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:22.578
in the glory and love
of our Lord Jesus.
