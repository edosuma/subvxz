<i>It's time to wake up...</i>

01:07.320 --> 01:09.240
<i>...and get a life.</i>

01:09.400 --> 01:11.560
<i>We live in a three-dimensional world.</i>

01:11.760 --> 01:14.080
<i>Until now, the world of computing's
been flat,</i>

01:14.280 --> 01:16.400
<i>consisting of two-dimensional
imagery.</i>

01:16.600 --> 01:19.600
<i>Now, through the use of exclusive
breakthrough technology,</i>

01:19.800 --> 01:22.800
<i>ARC has made it possible
for you to get a life.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:25.120
<i>A Life, where we can work and play</i>

01:25.320 --> 01:28.200
<i>in a lifelike world
of three-dimensional reality.</i>

01:28.600 --> 01:31.720
<i>A Life, the living monitor.</i>

01:32.280 --> 01:33.880
lmpressed?

01:35.960 --> 01:37.400
Yeah, I am.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.720
Would you put one of those
in a box for me?

01:51.640 --> 01:54.800
- Are you the lawyer?
- I'm Rita Dunne.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Obviously, no one from Nexim
could be here today.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.680
- I'd invite you in, but...
- Good luck, Mr. Jennings.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.680
- I'll see you in two months.
- Yeah.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.800
Home sweet home.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.400
What do you think?

04:01.400 --> 04:04.520
This is the exact same technology?

04:04.720 --> 04:06.520
Not the exact same technology, no.

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
Ultimately, I decided
to reconceive some of it.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.080
Ultimately, I decided
to reconceive some of it.

04:09.240 --> 04:11.760
I never liked the way
the monitor looked.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.160
And then it occurred to me...

04:14.360 --> 04:16.079
...who needs it?

04:18.040 --> 04:20.560
<i>Gentlemen,
I am the future of computing.</i>

04:20.760 --> 04:22.320
<i>And I would like to present you</i>

04:22.520 --> 04:25.280
<i>with Nexim's new Freedom Line
of display technology.</i>

04:25.480 --> 04:29.880
<i>New from Nexim.
Freedom is in your future.</i>

04:35.480 --> 04:38.960
Launch this now.
ARC is not gonna last.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.480
Who said 100 percent
market share's impossible?

04:41.680 --> 04:44.000
Get me Marketing immediately.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.400
This far exceeds our expectations.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.080
Congratulations.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.280
Well...

05:00.080 --> 05:01.560
...thank you.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.120
You understand, Mr. Jennings,
you've done in two months

05:05.320 --> 05:07.760
what we've been trying
to do for three years.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.360
Sometimes it's easier
if you work backwards.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.560
Cheers.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.560
You won't remember me, will you?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.840
No.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.000
That's too bad.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.120
<i>Marker reached.</i>

06:23.960 --> 06:25.240
OK.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.880
We're now extracting his memory

06:29.080 --> 06:31.040
from the marker forward
to the present.

07:00.560 --> 07:02.560
Jesus, Rita.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.680
Jesus Christ!

07:07.680 --> 07:09.320
This is dangerous enough.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.240
If this man's brain temp goes
one C above 43, he's a veg.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.240
Come on, Mike.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.840
Here we go.

07:45.680 --> 07:47.560
It's all clean.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.440
Good morning, sunshine.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.400
Hey, how you doing, big guy?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.760
- OK?
- Yeah.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.760
All right. Thank you. Take it easy.

07:59.960 --> 08:03.160
Slow, slow, slow.
There's no hurry, OK?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.600
- That's it. Good?
- Yeah.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.320
Good man. Hey, Mike, look at me.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.480
Look at me. Right here.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.880
What's the last date you remember?

08:17.040 --> 08:19.320
- October 19.
- Very good.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.320
Mike, what's the last thing
you remember?

08:27.200 --> 08:28.800
The Red Sox made the playoffs.

08:29.920 --> 08:33.600
OK. Let's get the legal
out of the way, shall we?

08:34.200 --> 08:38.200
Mr. Michael Jennings, under the terms
of your non-disclosure agreement,

08:38.400 --> 08:41.280
you are considered never
to have been an employee.

08:41.480 --> 08:46.360
You also understand that all your work
is the intellectual property of Nexim...

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.240
I never worked here. I never saw
anybody. I never was here. I got it.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.320
ls my paycheck ready?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.680
Alrighty.

09:04.080 --> 09:06.440
- How you feeling, tiger?
- Good.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.160
- Now let's hear you.
- All right.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.760
- Ready?
- Yeah.

09:12.680 --> 09:14.440
Go!

09:18.320 --> 09:22.040
ln order to zero the full eight weeks
I had to heat your brain to 42.5 C.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.280
- I'm fine.
- I'm saying it's getting harder, Mike.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.240
- I said, I'm fine.
- You're slowing down. Come on.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.080
I'd be faster if you'd shut up.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.320
Show me what you've got,
grasshopper.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.520
That's it. That's more like it!

09:36.040 --> 09:39.520
Yes! Go, go, go!

09:39.720 --> 09:41.280
Go! Go!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.320
Yes! Faster!

09:46.480 --> 09:48.600
Beautiful!

09:49.040 --> 09:52.160
Yes! One more! One more, Mikey!

09:54.640 --> 09:56.800
See how you did that?
How you focused?

09:57.040 --> 10:00.000
- Yeah. I focused on your face.
- You know you love me.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.680
Come on. Don't be mean to the
one who does everything for you.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.320
Do you realize you've never once
asked me what I see

10:07.520 --> 10:09.040
when I erase your memory?

10:09.240 --> 10:12.400
Basically, the last two months
just never happened for you.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.040
What's to know?
20 hours a day in a clean room

10:15.280 --> 10:18.800
ripping off a guy's idea for a computer,
selling it to somebody else.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.800
What'd you do the last two months?

10:21.040 --> 10:24.440
The last thing I remember is
driving in Spain in the Aston Martin,

10:24.640 --> 10:28.000
learning to dive in Belize
with what's-her-name.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.720
The seven-stadiums-in-seven-days
trip. It's great.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.320
I mean, my memories
are basically highlights.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.600
It's good. It's a good life.
The stuff you erase, it doesn't matter.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.320
What is it with guys like Rethrick?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.360
He's gotta have everything, huh?

11:45.920 --> 11:49.560
Say what you want about Jimmy,
he started Allcom in his garage.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.120
Wait, wait.
Don't you leave me alone.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.560
What? You'll be fine. Talk. Mingle.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.680
I don't want to mingle.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.280
Hello.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.920
I'm Michael.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.760
I'm Rachel.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.840
Rachel Porter.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.480
ls that Miss or Mrs.?

12:43.520 --> 12:46.160
That would be Dr. Porter.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.200
Doctor. Well, excuse me, doctor.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.640
It's all right.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.560
What kind of a doctor are you?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.720
- I'm a biologist.
- Really?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.440
Do you work for Jimmy?

13:02.640 --> 13:05.400
It must be very top-secret
biology that you practice.

13:05.840 --> 13:07.560
Oh, yes. lsn't everything?

13:13.680 --> 13:15.240
Let's go.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.280
Excuse me?

13:17.480 --> 13:21.680
I mean, I'm happy
to continue blathering on,

13:21.880 --> 13:23.440
trying helplessly to charm you,

13:23.640 --> 13:26.640
but I thought maybe, you know,
cut to the chase and just,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.400
you know, go somewhere.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.720
I'll tell you what, Michael.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.600
I'm gonna walk over there
and talk to a friend of mine.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.080
If you get the urge
to have a real conversation,

13:45.880 --> 13:47.480
you'll know where to find me.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.360
OK. Fair enough.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.880
It was nice to meet you.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.320
Giving up so easily?

13:58.800 --> 14:01.880
You don't believe in second chances,
now, do you?

14:02.640 --> 14:04.960
ln my experience, no, I don't.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.080
- Good night.
- Good night.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.600
- Mike.
- Jimmy.

14:19.760 --> 14:20.840
- How you doing?
- Good.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.320
- Good to see you.
- You too.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.840
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
- Come back this way.
- Sure.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.400
Hey, Jimmy.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.160
Now you're talking. Thank you.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.360
Wait a second.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.520
lsaac, disable fire protection, please.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.760
<i>Alarm disabled.</i>

14:46.960 --> 14:50.440
I don't think you'd look good covered
in foam. Even in that suit.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.240
What's the pitch, Jimmy?

14:52.440 --> 14:55.360
I know you're trying to sell me
something. What is it?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.480
When there was a time
we were in school,

14:59.680 --> 15:01.720
we wanted to change the world.

15:01.920 --> 15:03.800
I thought we wanted
to save the world.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.200
Well, that's semantics.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.800
- What's the job, Jimmy?
- Can't tell you.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.800
Other than to say
that it involves optics.

15:11.920 --> 15:14.160
And you get stock options
for this one.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.640
Get a real piece of the company.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.520
What if it doesn't work?
I get a real piece of nothing.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.000
I promise you, it won't fail.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.920
How do you know that?
ls this a real crystal ball?

15:27.400 --> 15:30.960
I wish. The point is, I'll guarantee
that you do eight figures.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.560
- Minimum.
- What's the catch?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.200
The job may require a little bit
more time than you're used to.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.320
- How much more time?
- Two years. Maybe three.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.360
- You're kidding.
- Deadly serious.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.160
Jimmy, that's impossible.
You can't do it.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.760
The longest ever is eight weeks.
It was me.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.480
Assuming it were possible,
would you do it?

15:56.600 --> 15:59.400
- Give up three years of my life?
- Not give up, trade.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.200
Three years in return
for the rest of your life.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.920
One big paycheck. You're done.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.960
<i>A lot can happen in three years.</i>

16:17.160 --> 16:19.280
<i>You blink, it'll be over.
Two seconds.</i>

16:19.480 --> 16:24.600
<i>A heartbeat, then snap, you're rich
beyond your wildest dreams.</i>

16:24.800 --> 16:28.280
<i>One big paycheck. You're done.</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:28.640
Mr. Jennings. John Wolfe.
Welcome.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.960
You won't be allowed
to leave the grounds.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.480
You'll be assigned a residence
here on campus.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.920
Your mail will be screened,
no phone calls.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.480
Anything you receive
will have to be inspected.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.840
OK.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.560
I'll need your personal belongings.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.160
Watch, wallet, anything else.
Nothing's allowed to be brought in.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.400
These items will be returned to you
when you pick up your paycheck.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.920
Sorry. Those too.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.400
- Mike, hey, you made it.
- Yeah.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.240
- Good to see you.
- You too.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.320
- Everything OK?
- Yep.

18:11.560 --> 18:12.720
Sit down.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.280
I assume Mr. Wolfe
gave you all the fine print.

18:15.440 --> 18:19.160
Yeah. He also took the last pair of
sunglasses I've managed not to lose.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.640
I'm sorry.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.600
What is this?

18:30.120 --> 18:31.480
It's for your memory wipe.

18:31.680 --> 18:34.640
We inject you with an isotope,
migrates to your brain

18:34.840 --> 18:36.040
serves as a marker.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.880
Another injection erases everything
back to the marker.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.120
No barbaric cooking of the brain.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.960
All right.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.920
Wow.

19:15.120 --> 19:18.600
- What have I gotten myself into?
- Let's go find out.

19:26.320 --> 19:29.040
<i>lnitiating Blue Script directory.</i>

19:32.680 --> 19:34.080
lmpressive.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.760
This used to be our smallest unit.
Now it's our most profitable.

19:37.960 --> 19:40.720
Mr. Rethrick, may I speak with you
for a moment?

19:40.920 --> 19:43.280
- Have a look around. I'll be right back.
- OK.

19:46.480 --> 19:50.440
<i>Cycle complete.
Begin transmission of data.</i>

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
All right! I give up! I give up.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.880
Don't give up.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.600
Dr. Porter. I guess I'm lucky you
didn't use thunder and lightning.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.240
True.

20:36.400 --> 20:40.120
OK, well, I won't question
your powers in the future.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.680
Sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

20:44.880 --> 20:47.040
I thought you said Marianne
was on a plane.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.600
She was planning to make the
conference call from the plane, sir.

20:52.400 --> 20:57.120
Look. I should probably apologize
for my behavior the other day.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.160
I get like that sometimes,
and I shouldn't. I'm sorry.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.360
Careful. You are in danger of sounding
like you want a second chance.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.040
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.160
- Say something else.
- Excuse me?

21:33.360 --> 21:36.040
Say something nice.
Quick, otherwise I'll forget it.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.600
Was that little breeze for our boy here?

21:40.840 --> 21:44.040
Well, I owed him one. Now we're even.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.720
Be nice, Mike's moving
into the neighborhood.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.760
Oh.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.360
- See you around.
- OK.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.600
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.400
You can still back out.

22:08.960 --> 22:10.680
No hard feelings.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.160
No, I want to stay.

22:24.400 --> 22:28.200
Michael Jennings, meet the other half
of your team, Dr. William Dekker.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.440
- Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.160
Gentlemen. Let's have a look
at the next three years of your lives.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.040
What happened?

23:21.160 --> 23:22.600
Michael.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.360
You're done.

23:28.240 --> 23:32.040
<i>- How long was it, Jimmy?
- It's been three years, Mike.</i>

23:33.600 --> 23:36.720
<i>- How'd I do?
- You did good.</i>

23:38.080 --> 23:41.280
<i>Your money's been transferred
to your account at Reddy Grant.</i>

23:41.480 --> 23:43.440
<i>You've got an appointment
there at 1:00.</i>

23:43.640 --> 23:47.240
<i>Just go home, do the paperwork.
When you feel up to it, give me a call.</i>

23:47.440 --> 23:49.360
<i>We've got a lot of catching up to do.</i>

24:04.840 --> 24:07.200
Ninety-two million dollars.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.680
Everyone at Reddy Grant
appreciates your business.

24:34.880 --> 24:38.680
Well, not as much as I appreciate
my business, I promise you.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.520
OK.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.520
Just sign there.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.880
- All right.
- Great.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.320
- Your personal items.
- Yes.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.000
You only needed four stamps.

24:58.960 --> 25:02.200
Oh, well, guess I could afford
the extra 50 cents.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.520
I don't think this is my stuff.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.240
- It's not?
- No.

25:16.560 --> 25:20.320
- I don't know what happened.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

25:20.520 --> 25:23.080
It doesn't matter.
Let's talk about my shares.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.680
What I'd like to do
is get some money now,

25:28.240 --> 25:31.680
and, you know, put the rest away
for long term, to live off.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.080
So how do we do that?

25:34.720 --> 25:37.000
Mr. Jennings,
you forfeited your shares.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.960
I beg your pardon? What?

25:41.440 --> 25:47.400
Yeah, here. Dated four weeks ago.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.080
You surrendered the shares

25:51.280 --> 25:54.200
and stated to deliver
only the envelope of personals.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.400
- Don't you remember doing that, sir?
- No.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.800
I don't remember that,
because I didn't do that.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.960
Why would I do that? I wouldn't
do that. It doesn't make sense.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.600
A mistake has been made,
and it needs to be corrected.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.920
- I agree. It's a strange thing you did...
- It's not strange.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.600
Strange is a little out of the
ordinary, but still plausible.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.880
Giving away $100 million in shares
in a Fortune 500 company

26:22.080 --> 26:24.880
for some knickknacks isn't strange,
it's insane.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.080
No one would do that.
Doesn't make sense.

26:27.280 --> 26:31.880
Unless you think this is a $40-million
can of hair spray, which is pink.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.840
What, this is a $100-million
book of matches?

26:35.040 --> 26:38.160
I've been out of it a few years.
ls this back in style now?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.520
Are these $100-million sunglasses?

26:40.720 --> 26:43.480
I'll look into it, but it's gonna
take me some time.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.680
This is crazy. I'm gonna make
some phone calls.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.520
<i>Mr. Rethrick's office.</i>

26:56.720 --> 27:00.360
<i>- It's Michael Jennings. It's important.
- I'm sorry, he stepped away.</i>

27:00.560 --> 27:02.600
<i>He won't be back until
this afternoon.</i>

27:02.800 --> 27:04.440
<i>I can try him on his cell phone.</i>

27:04.640 --> 27:07.040
Just have him call me
as soon as he gets in. OK?

27:07.240 --> 27:09.000
<i>- OK.
- Thank you.</i>

28:19.760 --> 28:23.000
Listen, guys, a mistake
has been made here. All right?

28:23.200 --> 28:26.560
- I'm not a traitor. I'm an engineer.
- A reverse engineer, right?

28:27.400 --> 28:31.960
We know that you accepted payment
of classified government technology.

28:32.160 --> 28:36.360
Mike, that's called treason. ln this
country, people get fried for that one.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.200
ln this country when the FBl harasses
you, you also get an attorney.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.800
Not today you don't.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.520
What the hell is this?

28:43.720 --> 28:45.600
The attorney general calls me
and says

28:45.800 --> 28:49.800
that Michael Jennings' cooperation
is a matter of national security.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.640
Look, first of all, that stuff
isn't mine, OK?

28:52.840 --> 28:54.120
A mistake...

29:00.560 --> 29:01.920
What is...?

29:02.720 --> 29:05.560
Perfect fit. You were saying?

29:09.440 --> 29:13.000
Well, let me show you a few pieces
of the puzzle that we're solving.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.480
William Dekker, government
physicist, weapons division.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.040
Three years ago, his project
gets shelved.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.200
He didn't like that, so he sold
his work. Classified work.

29:22.400 --> 29:25.600
Showed it to several corporations.
We think Rethrick bought it.

29:25.800 --> 29:30.440
Unfortunately, we can't link Rethrick
to the sale, because Dekker died.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.560
Natural causes.

29:32.760 --> 29:37.040
''Natural'' being gravity after a 1 40-foot
fall out of his apartment building.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.480
What does this
have to do with me?

29:39.680 --> 29:41.880
Patent applications filed this month.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.520
They show designs
based on Dekker's work.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.000
Look whose signature is on
every one of those documents.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.160
Get it?
It's your name on those patents!

29:50.360 --> 29:53.600
Rethrick can claim he knows nothing
about Dekker or the design.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.400
You need to tell us everything
you did for Rethrick.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.480
- I can't.
- You'd rather spend your life

30:01.680 --> 30:03.880
in prison protecting
your friend?

30:04.080 --> 30:07.360
- Help us, and we can work with you.
- I can't. I can't!

30:07.600 --> 30:09.800
He wiped my memory!
I don't remember!

30:10.000 --> 30:12.840
I'll tell you whatever I know.
I was set up. Believe me.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.800
I don't remember what I did
for the past three years!

30:24.880 --> 30:26.120
What?

30:26.320 --> 30:27.840
Wait a second!

30:33.960 --> 30:35.560
Wait!

30:36.280 --> 30:39.280
We figured Rethrick tried a wipe,
so we'll try an extraction.

30:39.480 --> 30:42.320
You're not gonna see anything.
You're wasting your time.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.360
We're getting something here.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.800
Come on!
Come on!

31:21.680 --> 31:23.120
Shit.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.000
We got nothing.

31:25.320 --> 31:25.920
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.400
Hold on a second.
I need a smoke.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.000
Boss.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.840
He won't mind.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.720
- Smoke!
- Shit!

31:55.920 --> 31:58.520
- Goddamn it!
- I can't see anything!

32:00.880 --> 32:02.920
Secure the door!

32:05.280 --> 32:07.240
Where the hell is he?

32:07.600 --> 32:10.360
- He's loose!
- Don't worry, he can't go anywhere!

32:11.600 --> 32:13.920
Cover the door!

32:14.760 --> 32:16.080
I'll get the lights!

32:19.120 --> 32:20.640
I can't see!

32:22.000 --> 32:24.520
Get low to the ground!
Stay low to the ground!

32:30.800 --> 32:32.320
Mitchell!

32:33.600 --> 32:34.760
See anything?

32:39.680 --> 32:41.520
- ls that him?
- Klein, where'd you go?

32:43.600 --> 32:45.520
Al, shut the door!

32:46.160 --> 32:47.920
What's going on?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.320
Good night, Mikey.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.040
Copy that.

33:51.120 --> 33:53.480
- Watch it, coming through!
- Go! Go! Go!

33:53.680 --> 33:55.120
- Coming through!
- Out of the way!

33:55.320 --> 33:56.680
- See him?
- I see him!

34:01.200 --> 34:03.040
- Out of the way, lady!
- There!

34:03.520 --> 34:05.400
Move! Move! Move!

34:13.080 --> 34:14.639
- Coming through!
- Let's go!

34:15.080 --> 34:16.360
Excuse me.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.040
Coming through!

34:20.880 --> 34:23.400
- Out of the way! Open those gates!
- Watch it, man.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.080
Come on! Come on!

34:31.440 --> 34:33.000
Where did he go?

34:34.159 --> 34:35.560
I'll get men at every stop!

34:35.760 --> 34:37.639
He'll be long gone by then!

34:37.840 --> 34:39.480
How the hell did he do that?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.160
- Sorry.
- You all right?

35:21.360 --> 35:23.240
- Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
- Be careful.

35:25.520 --> 35:26.920
Hey! Hey!

35:28.120 --> 35:29.520
Watch it!

35:32.240 --> 35:34.280
Hey! Hey!

35:52.120 --> 35:53.760
Jane. Relax.
Everything's fine.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.480
You talked to federal agents.
It's OK.

35:56.680 --> 35:57.960
It's been worked out now.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.680
I just need to find
out who sent these items.

36:01.320 --> 36:03.360
Will you help me out?

36:04.120 --> 36:07.120
- They were sent three years ago.
- No. There was a mix-up.

36:07.320 --> 36:11.120
Somebody else sent these. I need
to find out who that is and talk to them.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.280
Replacements were sent
a few weeks ago.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.600
- Who sent it?
- Well, you did.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.800
That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.240
<i>I'm gonna need all
your personal belongings.</i>

36:39.280 --> 36:41.600
<i>Michael Jennings died
at three minutes after 3.</i>

36:42.040 --> 36:45.880
The government, left with no case,
closed its investigation of Allcom.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.400
So you see,

36:49.040 --> 36:52.400
it's impossible that he escaped
unless you changed something.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.440
I didn't.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.280
- What were you doing, exactly?
- I was eating pie.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.680
He left the attorney's office
exactly when it predicted.

37:04.880 --> 37:07.080
The Feds took him exactly
when it predicted...

37:07.280 --> 37:10.040
But he didn't die like it predicted!

37:12.960 --> 37:15.040
Michael Jennings
is not a super agent.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.600
He's an engineer.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.800
Yet somehow he managed
to escape from a double-locked room.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
How? Was it fate?

37:23.200 --> 37:24.440
No, fate was on our side.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.600
That means someone changed
something. And it wasn't me.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.080
And if it wasn't you, then who the...?

37:39.040 --> 37:42.720
Has anyone checked the machine
since Michael walked out of here?

38:19.440 --> 38:21.120
Find him.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.760
''If you only look
where you can't go,

38:51.960 --> 38:55.080
''you will miss the riches below.''

38:55.480 --> 38:58.480
Yeah, I'm already missing my riches.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.760
''1 7-44-4-26-37-40-22.''

39:04.240 --> 39:06.880
A combination? A code?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.440
A password?

39:47.320 --> 39:49.720
''New Liberty Savings.''

39:50.160 --> 39:52.800
New Liberty Savings Bank, please.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.280
What does that mean?

39:57.960 --> 40:00.440
You're saying the bank
doesn't exist?

40:14.040 --> 40:15.400
That's comforting.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.160
<i>Who sent these items?</i>

40:36.160 --> 40:37.480
<i>You did.</i>

40:38.120 --> 40:41.040
<i>That's you right here.
See? Twenty items.</i>

40:45.320 --> 40:46.840
<i>These are patent applications.</i>

40:47.080 --> 40:50.640
<i>Look whose signature is
on every one of those documents!</i>

40:51.120 --> 40:53.640
<i>A mistake has been made here.
I'm not a traitor!</i>

40:57.280 --> 40:58.440
<i>Dekker died!</i>

40:58.640 --> 41:01.840
<i>Rethrick can claim he knows
nothing about Dekker or the design.</i>

41:02.040 --> 41:05.880
<i>Believe me! I don't remember
what I did for the past three years!</i>

41:07.040 --> 41:08.600
<i>Michael.</i>

41:11.720 --> 41:13.080
<i>Michael.</i>

41:14.560 --> 41:15.960
<i>You're done.</i>

41:21.880 --> 41:23.520
<i>Hello?</i>

41:23.720 --> 41:26.600
Jesus, Shorty.
You don't know how good it is

41:26.800 --> 41:29.560
<i>- to hear a familiar voice.
- Michael?</i>

41:29.760 --> 41:30.960
Listen, man.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.720
I'm in a... I'm in a jam,
and I need you.

41:33.920 --> 41:34.400
<i>All right.</i>

41:34.400 --> 41:35.280
<i>All right.</i>

41:35.480 --> 41:38.040
<i>Meet me at Union Station at 9:00.</i>

41:38.240 --> 41:40.480
<i>- I'll be there.
- OK, buddy.</i>

41:49.320 --> 41:53.920
<i>Outbound local from Seattle
to Kent departing from track five.</i>

41:58.840 --> 42:02.560
<i>Eastbound Spokane, gate ten.</i>

42:18.280 --> 42:19.480
<i>Michael.</i>

42:47.200 --> 42:50.200
Say one word about this hat
and I'm out of here.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.200
Oh, man!

43:01.400 --> 43:03.440
Oh, my God.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.520
I told you not to take that job, Mike.

43:19.080 --> 43:21.240
- Come on, let's get a table.
- OK.

43:22.840 --> 43:24.960
- lnjections?
- Yeah.

43:25.160 --> 43:27.240
You would have to do it
that way, I guess.

43:27.720 --> 43:30.000
But, of course,
that's a chemical process.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.160
So?

43:31.360 --> 43:33.720
Well, you'd have
some latent memories.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.800
Maybe that's what I'm seeing.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.800
Most likely. Memories
that made it through the wash,

43:40.000 --> 43:42.200
stirred up when the feds
went in your head.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.200
Why would I have these things?

43:44.840 --> 43:46.000
Explain this.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.520
I sent myself this junk
instead of the money.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.640
Oh, brother.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.200
I don't know.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.680
That's not the question
you should be asking.

43:55.880 --> 43:59.040
- No?
- No. You should be asking yourself,

43:59.240 --> 44:02.040
why did you give up
all that money?

44:02.640 --> 44:05.200
That's the most bizarre part
of this whole thing.

44:05.400 --> 44:09.400
Ninety million dollars. Nobody
changes that much in three years.

44:10.040 --> 44:11.560
OK, all right, buddy.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.720
I wanna figure out what you built.

44:13.920 --> 44:15.680
All right, let's work backwards.

44:16.360 --> 44:19.600
They told me I was working on
a design by someone named Dekker.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.800
- Dekker?
- Yeah.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.400
- William Dekker?
- I think so.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.600
What I heard was, he was working
on something level five for the feds.

44:29.800 --> 44:31.440
They came in,
shut him down.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.200
- What was it?
- Well, the consensus was a laser.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.600
- Why?
- Because Dekker's drawings

44:36.800 --> 44:38.440
called for a mirror and a lens.

44:38.640 --> 44:41.840
The only thing that uses those
is a laser or a satellite camera

44:42.040 --> 44:43.840
to see things from far away.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.840
<i>Here comes the first number, 1 7.
Followed by 44.</i>

44:48.040 --> 44:51.200
<i>- The lens required perfect optics.
- Four.</i>

44:51.400 --> 44:53.600
<i>- The mirror...
- Twenty-six.</i>

44:53.800 --> 44:57.040
<i>- So the capital outlay is huge.
- Thirty-seven.</i>

44:57.240 --> 44:59.360
<i>- Word was it was gonna cost
- Forty.</i>

44:59.560 --> 45:01.520
<i>- 500 billion dollars.
- And</i>

45:01.720 --> 45:04.160
<i>the bonus number is 22.</i>

45:04.360 --> 45:09.120
Who's gonna spend 500 billion
dollars just to see something?

45:12.360 --> 45:13.840
What?

45:15.080 --> 45:18.560
No way I get out of that
extraction room without the cigarettes

45:18.760 --> 45:20.640
and the glasses.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.640
I would've never gotten
on the bus without the ticket.

45:23.840 --> 45:27.520
If I didn't have the ring, I wouldn't
have followed that kid to Reddy Grant.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.400
- Right.
- I gave up that money

45:31.480 --> 45:34.840
just to make sure that I would pay
attention to these items.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.800
Why?

45:37.000 --> 45:40.280
Because I know what you'd
spend 500 billion dollars to see.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.960
The future.

45:47.760 --> 45:49.160
<i>If you selected five numbers</i>

45:49.360 --> 45:51.920
<i>and the bonus number,
you're a second-prize winner.</i>

45:52.120 --> 45:53.080
He used a virus.

45:53.480 --> 45:56.520
The machine went down
at 3:03 this afternoon.

45:57.560 --> 45:59.000
3:03.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.600
Can you program around the virus?

46:04.840 --> 46:07.200
No. It's not that kind of virus.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.320
Come on, I'll show you.

46:17.720 --> 46:19.880
It's not in the software.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.800
It's in the hardware.
He put a circuit somewhere in here.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.320
It's like a poison pill.

46:28.600 --> 46:29.960
But you can find it, right?

46:31.560 --> 46:33.080
Yeah, I can.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.520
Then do it.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.400
Slight change of plans.

46:40.600 --> 46:43.320
According to Mr. Stevens,
we don't need Jennings.

46:43.520 --> 46:47.960
Look, if we know anything, we know
that time travel's not possible.

46:48.160 --> 46:50.280
Einstein proved that, right?

46:50.480 --> 46:51.840
Time travel, yes.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.840
But Einstein was very clear
that he believed time viewing

46:55.040 --> 46:58.320
- theoretically could be accomplished...
- Mike, Mike. Come on.

46:58.520 --> 47:00.640
Maybe we should just find Dekker...

47:00.840 --> 47:02.800
- I can't talk to Dekker.
- Why not?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.120
- He had an accident.
- An accident?

47:05.320 --> 47:07.040
Yeah, he...

47:07.240 --> 47:09.080
He fell out
of his bedroom window.

47:09.280 --> 47:11.440
Fell out of...?

47:12.840 --> 47:15.280
He fell out of his bedroom window!

47:17.200 --> 47:19.440
I see. Sure.

47:19.640 --> 47:21.480
That could happen.

47:23.400 --> 47:24.680
Jesus. Wait a minute!

47:24.880 --> 47:27.800
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Shorty, listen to me.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.720
I think what happened

47:29.920 --> 47:32.520
was I used this thing,
I saw my future.

47:33.960 --> 47:36.320
And I saw what I needed to change it.

47:36.520 --> 47:40.120
But all I could get out of Allcom
were these innocuous items.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.040
Each item has to be used
at a specific time and place

47:43.240 --> 47:45.440
to accomplish whatever
I needed to get done.

47:45.640 --> 47:48.760
I mean, without the stuff in here,
I'd already be dead.

47:48.960 --> 47:53.040
Yeah, well, it's too bad that you don't
know what the rest of them are for.

47:56.920 --> 47:58.640
What?

48:17.640 --> 48:19.440
Gotcha!

48:28.400 --> 48:29.760
Hey!

48:31.880 --> 48:33.400
Great seeing you again, Mike!

48:34.560 --> 48:36.160
Jesus!

48:51.880 --> 48:54.160
Those guys do not look like feds.

48:55.680 --> 48:58.160
Here. Listen to me.
Take this.

48:58.360 --> 49:02.040
This will get you through that door.
Close it behind you. Understand? Go!

49:02.240 --> 49:04.800
- OK!
- Go! Go on!

49:08.800 --> 49:10.000
Shit!

49:11.440 --> 49:12.880
Go!

49:36.320 --> 49:39.360
Oh, God, I hope that was
a good thing to do.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.840
Shit.

52:07.240 --> 52:08.720
Go.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.880
Where's your gun?

52:12.080 --> 52:13.480
He's got it.

52:24.520 --> 52:25.720
So...

52:26.280 --> 52:27.560
...how are you, Mike?

52:30.200 --> 52:31.640
You?

52:32.600 --> 52:33.960
Why?

52:34.840 --> 52:36.480
Don't remember?

52:37.240 --> 52:40.000
You brought this
on yourself, Mike.

52:45.680 --> 52:48.480
So how does it feel

52:48.680 --> 52:50.480
knowing you're going to die?

54:09.240 --> 54:10.520
Shit.

54:50.120 --> 54:52.040
He designed his own escape?

54:52.280 --> 54:55.320
Mr. Attorney General, sir,
we have no explanation.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.880
After looking at the evidence
the only logical,

54:58.040 --> 54:59.960
albeit hard-to-accept conclusion,

55:00.160 --> 55:03.160
is he was able to predict
what was going to happen to him.

55:03.560 --> 55:06.480
These are memories extracted
from Jennings before he fled.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.320
They don't seem to add up to anything.

55:11.480 --> 55:13.240
Gladys.

55:14.680 --> 55:16.600
That's all for today.

55:22.600 --> 55:24.920
We knew Dekker was
trying to design something,

55:25.120 --> 55:28.160
but when he sold his plans,
he wasn't even halfway done.

55:28.360 --> 55:29.560
I don't understand.

55:29.760 --> 55:32.840
Dekker was working at JPL
on a laser-enhanced lens.

55:33.080 --> 55:35.000
He claimed the lens
was powerful enough

55:35.200 --> 55:37.560
to see around the curvature
of the universe.

55:37.920 --> 55:41.160
He believed if you could see
around a curve that went on forever

55:41.360 --> 55:43.480
you would end up back
where you started,

55:43.640 --> 55:45.040
looking at yourself.

55:45.240 --> 55:48.320
Except you're not looking
at yourself now, in the present.

55:48.520 --> 55:51.440
No, you are not.
You're looking at the future.

55:52.200 --> 55:56.280
lmagine what will happen if Jennings
figures it out and tries to profit from it.

55:56.480 --> 55:59.480
- Any nation will give a king's ransom.
- He won't do that.

55:59.680 --> 56:01.280
I was this close. He never lied.

56:01.480 --> 56:03.640
When he was accused
he was hurt and scared.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.200
Bring him in,
I'll give him the Medal of Honor.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.880
That's if Rethrick
doesn't find him first.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.880
You think he really saw the future?

56:18.720 --> 56:20.280
That would be something.

57:29.440 --> 57:30.640
Café Michel?

57:30.840 --> 57:33.000
My name is Michael Jennings.

57:33.600 --> 57:37.560
And I can't remember if I made
a reservation there recently.

57:37.720 --> 57:40.920
Would you check that out for me?
Thanks.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.840
I did?

57:44.840 --> 57:46.240
OK.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.720
Right. How many is it for?

57:50.960 --> 57:54.160
Oh, no, thank you.
No, I'll be there.

57:54.360 --> 57:55.880
Thank you.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.400
Hello, you two.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.040
Did he feed you?

58:43.880 --> 58:45.160
Rachel, it's Jimmy.

58:47.040 --> 58:50.120
- You all right?
- Why?

58:51.560 --> 58:52.760
You don't know?

58:54.320 --> 58:55.600
No.

58:57.160 --> 58:58.400
May I come in?

58:59.720 --> 59:01.920
When was the last time
you saw Michael?

59:02.120 --> 59:04.120
Yesterday morning.

59:04.320 --> 59:07.480
He was pulling
an all nighter at his lab.

59:10.840 --> 59:13.840
Rachel, I'm sorry to have to
be the one to tell you this.

59:14.240 --> 59:17.920
Michael left Allcom yesterday.
Permanently.

59:20.600 --> 59:23.360
- What?
- He finished his work.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.240
- We erased his memory, and he...
- No.

59:27.440 --> 59:30.680
- He left.
- No. He promised me.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.520
He said he wasn't going
to go through with it.

59:33.720 --> 59:36.080
He made a lot of money
on this one, Rachel.

59:37.280 --> 59:39.840
He said he didn't care
about the money.

59:49.400 --> 59:51.200
So she doesn't know anything.

59:51.400 --> 59:52.960
He wouldn't leave without her.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.760
It's Michael. He'd be smart.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.920
We're missing something.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.440
Soon as she leaves for work,
get in there.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.520
Make sure she can't
go anywhere alone.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.160
<i>I want to know
what just happened.</i>

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:43.240
Bye, guys.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.320
Good morning, Dr. Porter.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.640
Going somewhere?

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.720
Good morning.

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:11.120
Good morning.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:21.080
I'm going to go up top.
Take my bag.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.160
- You're gonna need this.
- Got it. Thanks.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.760
Coming?

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.200
No, thanks.
I'd rather watch from down here.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.080
Suit yourself.

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.720
We've been through the bathroom
and the rest of the apartment. Zero.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.800
This is what I want you to do.
Go back in the bathroom.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:07.680
OK, start turning left.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.560
Tell me what you see.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.360
The mirror.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.120
We've got him.

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.720
She's supposed to meet him
at Café Michel, 1 p.m.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:39.080
Well, let's make sure she does.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.800
I'm here to meet someone.
Michael Jennings.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.880
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:43.280
Sit at that table right there.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.320
ln the seat,
with your back to the window.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.960
<i>Michael, thank God you're all right.</i>

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.960
I thought I was never gonna
see you again.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.160
Michael, it's me.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.200
Rachel.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.040
Look...

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.240
You can't remember me.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.360
No. I'm sorry.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:44.120
Cops. We can't go in.
I'll have to wait for a clear shot.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.200
Maya, stall for time.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.640
<i>Tell him you thought
he'd remember something.</i>

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:51.000
<i>That you two were engaged.</i>

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.240
I guess I thought
you'd remember something.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:59.080
We've been together for three years.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.440
I don't know what to say.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.960
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.360
<i>I'm trying.</i>

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.720
That's how he's doing this.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.240
Listen to me very carefully, Maya.
This is what I want you to say.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.600
Michael, I can see you still have
the envelope.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.400
That means it's working.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.040
I know you switched
the personal items. I helped.

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:33.240
- You left me a note on a mirror.
- You left me a note on a mirror.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.600
I'm supposed to take something.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.760
Something I can use
to get to Stevens.

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.200
- He's a man you worked with.
- He's a man you worked with.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.880
He's trying to fix the machine.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.280
Work backwards, Michael.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:58.320
Yeah. Take the swipe card.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.000
That's the swipe card for the campus.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.400
You're supposed to give that to me.

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.560
Rachel wouldn't be hurt
if he hesitated, she'd be impatient.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.360
Look, Michael,
if you can't trust me right now,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.920
then we are lost. For good.

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.880
Nice.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.640
OK.

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:22.240
I'd better get back.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.160
They'll get suspicious soon.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.400
<i>Wait here.
I'll be back in half an hour.</i>

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.680
And don't worry,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:39.880
we end up together.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.960
Michael...

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.200
I love you.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:13.920
- What's my favorite baseball team?
- What?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.080
What's my favorite baseball team?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:21.160
Who cares?

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.000
Who cares?

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.960
That would be the Red Sox.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.520
- I think maybe we should go.
- Wait!

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.760
Now we can leave.
Come on.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.080
Wait! Hold on.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.640
- You have a car?
- I might.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.399
You might?

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.319
Look for a BMW!

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.560
You gotta be joking.

01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.359
Shit! Shit!

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.640
- Let me see that key.
- Why?

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.439
You're in the wrong section.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:41.000
Jennings bought the BMW
on the lnternet.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.399
He had the key mailed to him
four weeks ago.

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.399
- What's the color of his car?
- It isn't a car.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.960
They just turned on Pine.
lntercept them on Sixth.

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:30.439
- How good am I on this thing?
- You're OK!

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.160
- Look, I just said you're OK, OK?
- OK.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.200
Hang on!

01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:55.000
- Report of shots. Southgate BMW.
- Got it.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.640
Stop! I lost the envelope!

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:32.800
- I'll come back and get you.
- See you!

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.920
Got it!

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.560
Let's get out of here.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.840
Take us down!

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:14.520
Mike, we can help you!
We know what's going on!

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.280
Let us bring you in!

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.720
He's headed for the tunnel!
Cut him off! Cut him off!

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.400
Duck!

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:01.920
Split!

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.720
You think Jennings foresaw that?

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.840
Maybe next time he'll see
a nice quiet stakeout.

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.240
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:08.920
It's OK.

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.080
It's all for you anyway.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.440
And I...

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.920
I brought you some clothes.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.520
I thought you might need them.
I hope it's OK.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.560
Thank you.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.600
These are mine?

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.400
You don't remember?

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.040
No.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.240
You don't remember me, do you?

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.720
Well...

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.120
These are for you.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.280
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.320
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.000
<i>You're so sweet.</i>

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.160
I'm sorry.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.040
I'm sorry.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.000
I just don't remember.
I shouldn't have left.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.480
You're saying he sent himself
a different set of personal items

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.880
after using the machine,
and nothing our security would flag.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.000
Everyday things

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.280
combined with the power of foresight

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:44.080
transform Michael from engineer
to escape artist.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.440
I don't know about you,
but I'd like to return the favor.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.440
Michael, are you OK?

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.240
I'm all right.

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:24.480
Michael, I don't know what you saw
in your machine,

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.400
but I remember, a few weeks ago,
you came back from your lab, pale.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.160
You asked me the strangest question.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.160
- What?
- If I knew it wouldn't work out

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.640
for you and I, before we were together,
would I have done it?

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.960
What did you say?

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.280
That I wouldn't trade our time
for anything.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.400
That's all we are,
the sum of our experiences.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.120
Besides,

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.120
some of the best things in life
are total mistakes.

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:09.480
- What?
- You know,

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.160
when I checked this envelope out,

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.160
they told me I signed in 20 items,
but there were only 19.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.560
I don't understand.

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.040
What are these pictures of?

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:26.080
Michael, look at the rest
of the pictures.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:51.680
Look at the last one.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:00.480
Oh, my God. It's the future.

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.840
The machine predicts a war,

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.880
and we go to war to avert it.

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.040
It predicts a plague. We herd
all the sick together, create a plague.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.720
Whatever future this predicts,
we make happen.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.400
We give over control
of our lives completely.

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.960
I did this.

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.680
Seeing the future will destroy us.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.400
<i>If you show someone their future,</i>

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:40.160
<i>they have no future.</i>

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.960
<i>You take away the mystery,
you take away hope.</i>

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.400
I have to go back.
I have to destroy that machine.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.760
It's impossible. The campus is huge.
There are hundreds of guards.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:58.280
I wouldn't have given up the three
years we had unless I was sure

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:00.120
I could get us 50 more.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.720
OK. So how do we get in?

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.800
- We don't.
- You said everything was happening

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.560
for a reason, and that includes
me being here.

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.240
So come on.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.280
Hey, Rachel.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:27.720
Another day at the most.
I don't have many places to look.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.040
I guess you weren't as smart
as you thought, Stevens.

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:34.920
Hey, Jennings wouldn't find it any
faster unless he knew where to look.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.160
We've got the feeds
from mass transit.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:46.200
- He could be anywhere by now.
- Except

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.440
he's not running away.
He could've given himself a way

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:52.320
to disappear,
but look what he gave himself instead.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:55.520
His Allcom security pass.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.480
He's going back.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:09.840
Get a warrant to tap phone
and data lines coming out of Allcom.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.880
Put some bodies on that campus.
I want that machine!

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:37.480
Jennings and the girl were spotted.
What do you want me to do?

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.080
Nothing.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:05.160
- Stay where you are.
- Nobody gets through!

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.240
- Sir!
- I didn't do anything!

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.160
Settle down!

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:14.440
All the metal detectors on level four
just went off. Ball bearings.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.080
Just down the hall
from the metal detectors.

01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:33.400
Pull the guards off the Jennings lab.
Let him slip in, think he's fooled us.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.880
Once he's fixed the machine,
take him.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.400
I built this.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.280
This door shouldn't be open.
There's something wrong.

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.680
They're expecting us.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.840
Better close this door behind us.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.920
And keep it shut.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.600
- He's in.
- Confirmed. He's in.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.640
Once we confirm he's at the machine,
let's go after him.

01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.280
I thought we were gonna wait for him
to come out.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.120
I can't wait! Jennings
or the machine, I don't care,

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:23.120
as long as I get one. Let's go!

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.560
This will do. Watch out.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:36.080
- What are you doing?
- Smashing the lock.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.920
Hold on a second.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.640
You can't just smash the thing.
They'll still be able to get in.

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:45.400
We gotta jam the outside reader.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.160
Let's go.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:07.720
Let's take a look at the future
before we destroy this thing.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.760
I bugged it. I rigged it so Jimmy
wouldn't use it against me.

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.960
Then you can fix it, right?

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.040
Now, where would I have planted
that bug?

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:24.000
Maybe on one of the motherboards.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.560
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we won't be needing this, OK?

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.680
You're dangerous with that thing.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.000
You must have given yourself
something to help you find it.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.080
The only things left
are the bullet and...this.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:39.080
- Crossword?
- Yeah.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:44.640
Look at this.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.640
Twelve down.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.880
Maybe it's here.

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.960
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.080
Let's take a look.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:04.880
Maybe it's a circuit diagram.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.520
I wouldn't have put it
in the primary path.

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.720
Twelve down.

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.520
Take him.

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:35.360
OK, corridor three, sublevel A,

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.080
Jennings' lab.

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:51.520
All right, let's put this thing
to good use one last time.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.640
Let's get us out of here.

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.160
That's in the lab.

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:44.000
It's the catwalk.

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.960
Look, I've changed my future before,
using this thing. I can do it again.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:29.440
Don't have time. Gotta
destroy this before they get it.

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:32.480
Reprogram the door
to Jennings' lab, please.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.120
Now.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.680
He must've done something
to the controller.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.600
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- I don't know.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.240
Clear!

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:21.240
- What are you doing?
- These are liquid hydrogen.

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.240
They're used to cool the machine.
They fire in order.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.840
Number one just fired.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:29.320
When it gets down to number six here,
that's all she wrote.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.160
I'll see you when this goes off, Jimmy.

01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:40.120
Come on!

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.520
You see?
You judge too soon.

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.400
They went out through the vent.
Spread out, find them.

01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:37.600
Position three standing by.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.840
Come on.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.160
Freeze!

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.400
Look out.

01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.760
Seal off all exits to the lab.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.840
All right, Jennings,

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.360
let's see what you've been up to.

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.400
Rachel, go for the door, OK?

01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.480
Drop the gun.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.360
Drop the gun.

01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:02.360
Looks like Michael's
got a date on the catwalks.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.920
Let's make sure he makes it.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.560
- Let's go.
- We can't take the catwalk.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:29.120
I know. We won't, I promise.
Come on, let's go.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.520
- Michael! What are you doing?
- Go. I'll distract them.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:43.880
- Go, please.
- No!

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.040
Listen to me. This is my debt.
I built this machine.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.640
- I have to pay for it.
- You come with me now!

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:52.400
You promised
you'd change your fate!

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.560
Please, we don't have time.

01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:00.280
If you love me, if you care
about me, go. Have a good life.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.640
Remember me.

01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.240
Damn you.

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.920
Jimmy.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.480
You want to kill me,

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.200
come do it yourself.

01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.440
Here I am. You want me?
Come get me.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:37.120
- Hi, Jimmy.
- Hi, Mike.

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:40.720
- Looks like this is it, huh?
- It is, Mike.

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.760
- You only have yourself to blame.
- That's a lie.

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.720
You can't change your fate.
You're gonna die today.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:49.560
Maybe.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.200
But you're not going to kill me.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:02.040
That's right, Mike.
I've seen the future.

01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:17.720
Still think you can
change your fate, Mike?

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:21.480
I am the future, Mike!

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.760
- Rethrick has Jennings.
- Retire him.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.640
- What?
- We have the machine.

01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.000
We can't risk its creator falling
into the wrong hands. Come on.

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.640
Don't blame me.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:57.880
You and Michael would've lived
happily ever after, no memory wipe.

01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:00.320
He saw something he didn't like.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.800
He's the one who decided
he wanted to stop the program.

01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:22.840
Look at it this way,
you did change the future, Michael.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:25.280
Before you interfered
you both would've lived

01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.360
and we would still be friends,
instead of ending up like this.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:32.320
It wasn't meant to be.

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.440
Giving up so easy?

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:46.360
Don't you believe in second chances?

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:50.120
To tell you the truth, I do.

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.080
Go, go, go.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.880
Rachel!

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.240
Let's go.

01:44:47.240 --> 01:44:49.120
Look.

01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.720
Any records? Any papers?

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:03.680
Explosion destroyed everything.

01:45:09.240 --> 01:45:13.160
- Are we trying to salvage that or what?
- I guess we don't get the machine.

01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.920
Any sign of Jennings?

01:45:42.640 --> 01:45:46.240
No, I'm afraid he didn't make it.

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:30.880
What was Shorty thinking,
starting a nursery?

01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.240
I mean, these plants
are on life-support.

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:36.440
What do you mean? Really?
He told me he had a green thumb.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:38.920
Gangrene is more like it.

01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:42.240
Lucky for Shorty, I'm a biologist.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.800
Lucky for both of us.
Since I failed biology,

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.320
- I'm no help to either one of you.
- So you say.

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.720
Too bad, though,
because I'm looking for a partner

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:54.440
- for a start-up company.
- Really? Doing what?

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.080
We're gonna save the world.

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.280
I don't think I'm your guy.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:05.520
But would you settle for someone
who wants to help you change it?

01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:07.960
- OK.
- Good.

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.680
So how does it end for us, Michael?
I mean, what's in our future?

01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.160
You know, I don't know.
I kind of like it that way.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.800
- I do know one thing.
- What's that?

01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:24.040
I never want to forget anything
ever again.

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.160
Break it up, break it up.
The birdman cometh.

01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.960
- Shorty.
- It's dinner.

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.840
- You found them.
- Yes, I did.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:38.400
- Who does everything for everybody?
- You do.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:39.840
- You're right.
- You're my hero.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.000
Thank you very much.

01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.880
- You hear that? I'm a hero.
- That's great.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.240
I think I remember.
Are those our birds?

01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.120
Yes, of course they are.
We bought them together.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.560
You remember the birds? Well done.
You could see into the future

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:57.680
and all you remember
are Polly and Tweety there.

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:00.200
Why not remember something
that'd make us rich?

01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:02.440
- Wait a second.
- What is it?

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.120
- I think there was something else.
- No, no, no.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:07.800
The envelope's empty.
Don't worry about it.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:12.160
Hold on. I'm working backward here.

01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:21.760
''If you only look where you can't go,
you will miss the riches below.''

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:26.680
I must've known you'd never
get rid of these birds.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.840
Of course not. They're family.

01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:33.600
So I knew this would be here.
What only looks where it can't go?

01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:35.480
A caged bird.

01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:40.000
''You will miss the riches below.''

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.280
The riches below.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.320
What is that?

01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:59.000
Well, that's a $90-million
lottery ticket.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.280
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- It's $90 million.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.040
- Nice.
- Yes, I'm proud of it.

01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.600
Wait a minute. No.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:07.440
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.800
You know what?

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.120
I think now's a good time
to discuss my commission, 33%.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.280
- I thought it was 5.
- No, 33.

01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.000
- Thirty-three percent!
- He deserves it.

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.560
It was found on my premises.

01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:23.360
I'll get back to you.
I'm gonna cash this in.
