00:53.000 --> 00:57.125
{\an8}<i>$658,000 was stolen from
the Seneca Savings and Loan</i>

00:57.208 --> 00:59.375
{\an8}<i>over this past
Fourth of July weekend.</i>

00:59.958 --> 01:02.041
<i>Local police
have found no clues</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:05.916
<i>as to how the bank robber
was able to enter or exit the bank.</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:08.834
<i>Another small town
bank robbery over the weekend.</i>

01:08.916 --> 01:11.083
<i>No suspects have been identified.</i>

01:12.166 --> 01:13.667
<i>Now, a third robbery,</i>

01:13.750 --> 01:16.166
<i>this time in Williamsport,
Pennsylvania,</i>

01:16.250 --> 01:19.500
<i>by what appears to be
the same modus operandi.</i>

01:20.500 --> 01:23.166
<i>The In-and-Out
Bandit has done it once again.</i>

01:23.250 --> 01:25.875
{\an8}<i>The eighth robbery in the past six years</i>

01:25.958 --> 01:28.542
{\an8}<i>and authorities still have no suspects.</i>

02:05.041 --> 02:06.125
Hello?

02:10.208 --> 02:11.333
Hello?

02:43.709 --> 02:45.667
Oh, good.

02:45.750 --> 02:48.083
I was wondering when somebody
was gonnasss show up and help me.

02:48.167 --> 02:50.833
- Oh, I... I don't...
- I need a storage unit

02:50.916 --> 02:54.041
for all the crap that I have,
that I don't really want or need,

02:54.125 --> 02:55.625
but that I'm too chicken
to get rid of.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.542
Actually, considering all my baggage,

02:57.625 --> 03:00.000
I might need two units,
depending on how,

03:00.083 --> 03:01.833
you know, big and smelly they are.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.459
You prefer smelly?

03:03.542 --> 03:05.791
I do. Who doesn't, really?

03:07.500 --> 03:09.417
Ooh. That looks good.

03:10.041 --> 03:11.417
Oh. Please, allow me.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.916
Mmm. Thank you.

03:14.584 --> 03:17.500
- You work here, right?
- I do.

03:17.584 --> 03:19.791
I do. Although, you know,

03:19.875 --> 03:21.916
I prefer to call it "paid study hall."

03:22.000 --> 03:23.584
Oh. You're in college, huh?

03:24.625 --> 03:26.041
Don't I look like
I'm in college?

03:26.125 --> 03:29.041
BC, grad school.

03:29.625 --> 03:32.333
- Three semesters to go.
- Good for you.

03:32.417 --> 03:34.041
Ah. So, let me guess.

03:34.459 --> 03:35.709
You need a storage unit.

03:35.791 --> 03:37.417
Yes, please.

03:37.499 --> 03:39.624
Preferably one that doesn't smell.

03:39.708 --> 03:43.250
Okay. Let's see what I can do.
But, um,

03:43.333 --> 03:45.375
we should probably switch places.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.875
- Oh, yeah. Sorry. Right.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:54.750 --> 03:56.417
So, uh...

03:58.459 --> 04:00.000
Fill in the blank
with your name here.

04:00.083 --> 04:01.875
- Tom.
- Tom.

04:02.916 --> 04:04.000
Tom.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.417
We have small, medium, and large.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.958
Well, I just moved into town,
I don't have much,

04:09.041 --> 04:12.125
so I guess
medium should work.

04:12.208 --> 04:14.667
Fill in the blank with your name.

04:16.791 --> 04:18.833
- Annie.
- Annie.

04:19.333 --> 04:23.667
All right.
Medium and not smelly it is.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.208
Come on, come on.

05:00.292 --> 05:01.459
How did you get in?

05:01.542 --> 05:03.000
The back door was open.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Just 'cause there's a "for sale" sign
doesn't mean that this isn't,

05:08.292 --> 05:10.208
I don't know, breaking and entering.

05:10.292 --> 05:12.042
- Trespassing?
- Oh, yeah.

05:12.916 --> 05:13.916
Maybe.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.584
I mean, come on, you know,
I'm all for a little mischief,

05:16.666 --> 05:19.625
but what are we...
What are we doing here?

05:22.916 --> 05:24.250
What do you think?

05:25.542 --> 05:27.208
Oh. Uh...

05:28.250 --> 05:30.083
What do I think... I think it's...

05:31.167 --> 05:32.708
I think it's cute.

05:33.375 --> 05:36.334
You know, reminds me
of the Cape I grew up in.

05:36.417 --> 05:37.791
Yeah, I know.

05:38.666 --> 05:42.125
I mean, it could use
some paint. Maybe yellow.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.000
Yellow, huh?

05:44.708 --> 05:47.459
And, uh, Newton's a great neighborhood.

05:47.542 --> 05:50.083
Lots of nice restaurants and parks.

05:50.167 --> 05:53.542
And I hear amazing police department,
so let's get out of here.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.083
Uh... So I heard.

05:56.958 --> 06:00.916
Maybe they'll go easy on us
if we make a decent offer.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.500
Wait. I'm sorry, what?

06:04.584 --> 06:07.791
That is if you're interested
in moving in with me.

06:09.417 --> 06:10.666
Are you...

06:10.750 --> 06:12.375
Okay, are you messing with me right now?

06:12.459 --> 06:14.000
Not in the slightest.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.917
It's been a year, honey.
One year.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.334
It has.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.208
Aw, it's been a wonderful,
wonderful year.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.583
I just don't...

06:30.208 --> 06:31.750
I don't know, I just...

06:33.625 --> 06:34.833
I haven't

06:36.375 --> 06:39.167
lived with anyone
since the divorce, and, uh...

06:43.542 --> 06:45.833
I just can't go through that again.

06:45.917 --> 06:47.125
You won't have to.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.375
I promise.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.208
Oh, God, it is a beautiful home.

06:59.542 --> 07:02.125
So, is that a, uh...

07:03.375 --> 07:04.625
Yes?

07:05.167 --> 07:08.083
Can you... Can we even afford this?

07:08.167 --> 07:11.625
Well, I have to work out
a couple of things, but

07:11.708 --> 07:13.167
yes, we can.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.167
Okay.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.375
Yeah!

07:31.541 --> 07:32.917
- Annie?
- Mmm?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.791
There is something else
I need to tell you.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.500
No. Not tonight.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.625
This girl has had
enough surprises for one night.

07:42.583 --> 07:43.791
It can wait.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.167
Here.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.541
Suppose I ought to get you
some real dog food, huh?

08:28.334 --> 08:29.750
What kind do you like?

08:39.750 --> 08:42.208
- Ain't that Theresa's dog?
- Used to be.

08:42.957 --> 08:46.209
- What does that mean?
- The divorce, it went through.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.792
It's official.

08:48.875 --> 08:51.292
She got the house and I got Tazzie.

08:51.375 --> 08:52.917
Did you even want Tazzie?

08:53.875 --> 08:56.125
But her freakin' lawyer
was asking for everything.

08:56.209 --> 08:58.292
The house, the two cars,
the few stocks we own.

08:58.375 --> 08:59.875
So I started asking
for everything.

08:59.958 --> 09:02.083
The judge was rational,
cut everything down in the middle,

09:02.167 --> 09:03.666
except for the house and the dog.

09:03.750 --> 09:05.250
And she preferred the house.

09:56.334 --> 09:59.416
<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?</i>

10:00.708 --> 10:03.792
I'm the In-and-Out Bandit.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.708
I wanna turn myself in.

10:08.458 --> 10:09.708
<i>Please hold.</i>

10:20.500 --> 10:23.541
<i>FBI. Special Agent Sam Baker.
How can I help you?</i>

10:24.334 --> 10:27.375
I'm the In-and-Out Bandit.
I wanna turn myself in.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.541
<i>Give me a second.</i>

10:30.541 --> 10:32.333
We got another In-and-Out confession.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.750
That's a popular one.
Must be trending.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.416
Whatever that means.

10:39.209 --> 10:41.500
Okay. Why don't we start with a name?

10:41.583 --> 10:42.958
You can call me Tom.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.792
Tom Carter.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.209
Okay.

10:48.458 --> 10:49.583
Tom Carter,

10:49.667 --> 10:51.250
why don't you tell me
what you've been up to?

10:51.333 --> 10:53.875
<i>I'm in the news.
You know what I've been up to.</i>

10:53.958 --> 10:54.958
Humor me.

10:57.292 --> 10:59.583
I've robbed 12 banks
in seven states.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.333
I've a little over
nine million dollars in cash.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.416
And no one knows who I am.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.125
How long'd that take?

11:08.167 --> 11:10.458
Um, about eight years.

11:10.541 --> 11:13.625
<i>But I haven't robbed anything
in over a year.</i>

11:13.708 --> 11:16.333
<i>Okay. You got an address
where I can find you?</i>

11:18.291 --> 11:19.416
I wanna make a deal.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.333
A deal?

11:22.625 --> 11:23.833
What kinda deal?

11:24.333 --> 11:27.084
I hand over all the money
I stole, every penny,

11:27.625 --> 11:29.917
in exchange for a reduced sentence,

11:30.000 --> 11:32.833
no more than two years
in minimum security

11:32.917 --> 11:34.416
within an hour of Boston.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.084
<i>With full visitation rights.</i>

11:36.167 --> 11:38.167
You've thought this through.

11:38.250 --> 11:39.750
It's important.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.209
And what's so important about it?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.959
I...

11:46.500 --> 11:47.875
I met a woman.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.541
She's smart, caring, driven, funny.

11:53.917 --> 11:55.708
I adore every bit of her.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.167
I want to be with her
for the rest of my days

11:59.250 --> 12:03.250
without feeling guilty
about lying to her about my past

12:04.583 --> 12:05.750
indiscretions.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.708
Well, she sounds
like an incredible woman.

12:08.792 --> 12:09.792
<i>She is.</i>

12:10.959 --> 12:13.875
And she means more to me
than all the dollar bills in the world.

12:17.125 --> 12:18.875
So, do we have a deal?

12:18.959 --> 12:20.583
That's not how it works, buddy.

12:20.667 --> 12:24.375
But I'll be happy to listen to you
and put in a good word for you

12:24.458 --> 12:26.875
if you are in fact
the In-and-Out Bandit.

12:26.959 --> 12:28.833
- What do you mean, "if"?
- <i>Listen.</i>

12:28.917 --> 12:30.708
Ten, fifteen guys

12:30.792 --> 12:32.708
have confessed to being
the In-and-Out Bandit.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.250
You think I'm making this up?

12:34.333 --> 12:36.125
Well, you wouldn't be the first.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.208
I'm telling the truth.
I'm the In-and-Out Bandit.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.250
Even though I hate that name
you people gave me.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.833
It wasn't me.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.500
All right.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.000
Where can I find you?

12:48.708 --> 12:50.375
The Charleston Hotel.

12:51.333 --> 12:53.167
Room 216.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.167
That's a nice place.
I'll swing by there tomorrow.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.375
I'll be here.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.792
He met a woman.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.792
Poor guy.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.208
Got another In-and-Out confession.

13:15.625 --> 13:18.208
All the details are in here.
Would you boys look into it?

13:18.291 --> 13:20.458
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah, will do, sir.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.792
{\an8}- Hi, sweet Annie.
- <i>I aced it.</i>

13:31.750 --> 13:34.250
{\an8}- Aced what?
- <i>My exam!</i>

13:35.208 --> 13:36.875
Oh! Right.

13:36.959 --> 13:39.792
Oh, fantastic! I knew you would.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.458
- What's wrong?
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

13:42.542 --> 13:44.708
I can hear it in your voice.
Something's going on.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.458
- You sound like a therapist.
- <i>I almost am one.</i>

13:47.542 --> 13:50.750
- Although not yours.
- I know.

13:50.834 --> 13:53.166
<i>So, what's going on
in that brain of yours?</i>

13:55.583 --> 13:58.875
Uh... I'm just a little preoccupied,
that's all.

13:58.959 --> 14:03.625
What, with work? It's a little late
to be fixing safes, isn't it?

14:03.708 --> 14:05.875
<i>No, the apartment above mine,</i>

14:05.959 --> 14:10.125
one of his pipes burst in his bathroom
and flooded my place.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.583
Had to get a hotel room.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.084
<i>It's okay, they're paying for it.</i>

14:14.166 --> 14:16.834
Yeah? So, where are
they putting you up?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.333
The Charleston Hotel.
It's not so bad.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.750
<i>Mmm. Maybe I should come on over.</i>

14:21.834 --> 14:24.125
<i>I got a five-dollar bottle of wine.</i>

14:24.208 --> 14:26.166
- We could celebrate.
- <i>Tempting.</i>

14:26.416 --> 14:29.000
I'm just a bit wiped out, baby.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.125
You sure you're okay?

14:33.583 --> 14:35.959
- Annie?
- Yes, my love.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.042
I'm proud of you.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.000
Mmm. Thank you.

15:13.625 --> 15:14.875
- Oh. Hello.
- Hello.

15:14.959 --> 15:15.959
Room clean?

15:16.042 --> 15:18.208
Uh... No, thank you.
Not today.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.125
- Please.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

15:31.291 --> 15:33.041
<i>You can't do that! Tazzie needs me.</i>

15:33.125 --> 15:34.709
<i>You don't even know
how to take care of Tazzie!</i>

15:34.792 --> 15:35.959
- There...
- <i>You're crazy!</i>

15:36.041 --> 15:37.500
Theresa. Theresa.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.542
She's doing just fine.

15:39.625 --> 15:41.834
No. No!
No, no, you heard the judge.

15:41.917 --> 15:44.291
You made your choice.
Well, that was the deal.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.458
She's my dog. You can't have her back.

15:46.542 --> 15:47.792
Goodbye.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.792
- Special Agent Meyers. How...
- <i>I asked for Agent Baker.</i>

15:49.875 --> 15:52.000
- Uh, he's out.
- When will he be back?

15:52.083 --> 15:53.750
<i>He didn't say.
You wanna leave a message?</i>

15:55.625 --> 15:58.375
This is Tom Carter.
I talked to him the other day.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.333
Oh, right.
The In-and-Out Bandit.

16:02.417 --> 16:05.041
<i>I really wish you guys
would stop calling me that.</i>

16:06.500 --> 16:09.166
I could put in a special request.
What name would you prefer?

16:09.291 --> 16:13.458
I don't know. In-and-Out
just sounds so low rent, unprofessional.

16:13.750 --> 16:16.083
My work has always
been precise, clean.

16:16.166 --> 16:19.083
I think "clean" is taken.
You wanna go with "precise"?

16:19.166 --> 16:22.458
- <i>How about Precise Bandit?</i>
- Funny.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.208
Look, something came up...

16:24.291 --> 16:27.125
I've been waiting
for two days! Two days!

16:27.207 --> 16:29.000
- <i>When will he be...</i>
- Well, let me finish, guy.

16:31.165 --> 16:32.542
Something came up,

16:32.624 --> 16:35.166
but he assigned a couple
of very good agents to your case.

16:35.250 --> 16:36.250
When will they be...

16:36.332 --> 16:37.875
I'm sure they'll be there
very shortly.

16:37.959 --> 16:39.375
You have
a good day, Mr. Carter.

16:46.625 --> 16:47.834
Enough of this.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.667
Special Agent Hall.
This is Special Agent Nivens.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.667
You the Bandit?

16:56.750 --> 16:59.083
I'm Tom Carter, yes.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.250
I don't get it.
I'm trying to come clean here,

17:03.333 --> 17:05.375
drop nine million dollars
in your laps.

17:05.750 --> 17:09.125
Make you guys look like heroes,
and you don't believe me.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.208
It's nothing
to get worked up, okay?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.291
We believe that you believe

17:13.375 --> 17:15.000
you have nine million dollars
in stolen money.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.208
How about we try this?

17:16.291 --> 17:18.958
You give us something
that we haven't read online

17:19.040 --> 17:20.916
or seen on a YouTube clip.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.375
Specific details about these robberies
that only you would know.

17:28.625 --> 17:29.834
Okay.

17:30.625 --> 17:31.667
All right.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.333
<i>Twelve banks.</i>

17:34.958 --> 17:37.500
<i>The key was picking
the right bank at the right time.</i>

17:38.792 --> 17:43.375
<i>I focused on small town banks
with older vaults, pre-1950.</i>

17:43.458 --> 17:45.625
<i>The relocking mechanisms
on the newer models</i>

17:45.709 --> 17:47.000
<i>are more difficult to blow.</i>

17:48.709 --> 17:50.208
<i>But just as important,</i>

17:50.292 --> 17:52.709
<i>I needed the bank to have
a vacant building next to it</i>

17:52.792 --> 17:54.667
<i>with an adjoining wall.</i>

17:55.458 --> 17:57.458
<i>If you check the dates
of the robberies,</i>

17:57.542 --> 17:59.625
<i>you'll notice
I always went in on a Friday night</i>

17:59.709 --> 18:01.916
<i>over a three-day holiday weekend.</i>

18:03.834 --> 18:06.709
<i>I would enter the bank through
an air conditioning vent.</i>

18:08.125 --> 18:10.083
<i>It took patience and a steady hand</i>

18:10.166 --> 18:12.208
<i>to drill through
composition steel doors,</i>

18:13.208 --> 18:15.166
<i>something I couldn't rush.</i>

18:16.041 --> 18:19.000
<i>I preferred using gelignite
stuffed into balloons.</i>

18:19.083 --> 18:21.041
<i>That'll blow almost any bolt.</i>

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
<i>I covered my tracks
by patching the wall</i>

18:30.083 --> 18:32.250
<i>with some plaster
and a little paint.</i>

18:33.166 --> 18:36.333
<i>When I was finished,
it was like I was never there.</i>

18:36.417 --> 18:37.875
Interesting.

18:39.916 --> 18:41.792
So let's say we do believe you...

18:42.500 --> 18:43.709
Where's the money?

18:43.792 --> 18:45.166
First things first.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.542
I want some guarantees.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.709
- Of course, the, uh, deal proposal.
- Yeah.

18:50.792 --> 18:52.584
- Minimum security...
- Near Boston,

18:52.667 --> 18:53.958
with visitation rights.

18:54.041 --> 18:56.958
Okay. Well, uh,
we should probably go.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.000
- Yeah.
- What? Where are you going?

18:59.458 --> 19:02.625
Your story's good, all right?
And we'll try to verify the facts.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.792
But I'm sorry,
no one's cutting a deal without proof.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.542
- The money.
- Exactly.

19:11.500 --> 19:14.667
Aurora self storage.
A few miles west of here.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.208
Unit 173.

19:18.417 --> 19:19.417
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.208
Thanks, Mr. Carter, but I'll take those.

19:21.292 --> 19:23.916
- We'll check it out.
- Shouldn't I come with you?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.417
- No. Not necessary.
- We'll be back.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.375
Stay put.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.958
You think this lady is real,
or is she a delusion?

19:43.041 --> 19:44.625
What, like this money?

19:44.709 --> 19:46.625
Love is weird, man.

19:47.584 --> 19:49.667
Look, I thought I knew
how much I love my wife

19:49.750 --> 19:52.208
even before we were married,
but it doesn't compare

19:52.292 --> 19:54.375
to how much I love
those two little boys.

19:54.833 --> 19:56.125
It's just something
about being a father.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.916
Isn't that just a sales pitch, though?

19:58.459 --> 20:00.584
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.916
I just feel like every new father
can't stop talking

20:03.000 --> 20:05.958
about how great it is
to be a new father, you know?

20:06.041 --> 20:08.417
Wish they did it sooner.
Best thing they ever did.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.875
I don't buy it, man. I think they're
just trying to convince their friends

20:11.958 --> 20:14.500
to push out a couple of kids,
so they got someone to commiserate with

20:14.584 --> 20:16.333
while they're watching kiddie soccer.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.916
You ever thought
about snipping your balls off?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.417
I think
it could be a good idea.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.250
Yeah, no one's clipping my junk.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.250
Speaking of which, are we done here?

20:26.208 --> 20:27.500
John.

20:33.916 --> 20:35.709
I think this girl is real.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.500
And amazing.

20:44.292 --> 20:45.750
Looks legit.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.542
Son of a bitch was telling the truth.

20:53.292 --> 20:54.500
Get the trunk.

20:56.625 --> 20:57.708
Open the trunk.

21:00.584 --> 21:02.750
What are we doing here?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.875
Confiscating stolen property.

21:05.958 --> 21:07.167
For evidence.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.292
No, for our personal retirement funds.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.667
Are you outta your mind?
We can't take this!

21:13.791 --> 21:16.584
Oh, don't act like we're popping
your cherry, okay? Please.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.042
- This is different.
- How is it different?

21:19.125 --> 21:20.791
How is it different?

21:20.875 --> 21:22.584
Look, whether you're pinching

21:22.667 --> 21:24.625
a couple of bills
off some guy washing cash

21:24.708 --> 21:27.250
or squeezing a gaming racket for 20K,

21:27.333 --> 21:29.000
the concept's the same.
How is this different?

21:29.083 --> 21:31.916
I can think of nine million reasons
why this is different.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.666
You're right, okay?
So we turn it in, yeah?

21:35.750 --> 21:38.791
It sits in evidence
for two years while they try this asshole.

21:39.292 --> 21:40.542
Who gets rich?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.208
Lawyers.

21:42.958 --> 21:46.125
Meanwhile, you and I
are out here every day,

21:46.208 --> 21:49.334
busting our butts,
risking our lives, for what?

21:49.417 --> 21:51.584
To get by?
You like getting by?

21:51.666 --> 21:53.292
That's the job I signed up to do.

21:53.375 --> 21:55.791
Oh, that is noble and naive.

21:55.875 --> 21:59.500
Don't let the car
and the badge and the gun fool you.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.042
It doesn't belong to you.
It belongs to the Man.

22:02.125 --> 22:03.375
He owns you and he owns me.

22:03.459 --> 22:06.292
Until he cuts us loose,
what are we actually left with, huh?

22:10.625 --> 22:13.042
I see your point,
but we're never gonna get away with this.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.500
Carter's gonna scream bloody murder.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.833
So let him. What's one nutjob's word
against ours, huh?

22:18.625 --> 22:21.208
No one's gonna believe
that "all for love" story.

22:21.292 --> 22:23.000
All right? Where's the evidence?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.083
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.750
It's nothing but perfect.

22:28.334 --> 22:29.708
We could go to prison.

22:29.791 --> 22:31.208
Look,

22:31.292 --> 22:34.750
the universe just dropped
a gift bag of money on your doorstep.

22:35.417 --> 22:37.791
Money that doesn't belong
to anybody.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.875
Enough to never have to worry about
another mortgage payment,

22:42.459 --> 22:45.417
or where you can
or can't send those boys to school.

22:46.459 --> 22:48.459
All you gotta do is pick up a box,

22:49.250 --> 22:51.125
and be a hero to your family.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.917
Hey, it's your call.

23:08.708 --> 23:09.958
Let's do it.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.125
Excuse me.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.042
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:24.125 --> 23:25.125
I'm the manager here.

23:25.208 --> 23:27.833
I saw you guys on the security camera.
I didn't recognize you.

23:27.917 --> 23:30.208
I'm Pete. This is Mario.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.292
- How are you?
- Hey there.

23:31.375 --> 23:33.459
We're friends of Tom's.
He, uh... He rents this unit.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.292
- Yeah, yeah, I know Tom.
- Oh.

23:35.375 --> 23:36.666
Is he coming?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.833
No, but... He gave us the key.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.875
Yeah, he's busy. Moving.

23:40.958 --> 23:43.167
- Moving?
- Mmm.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.334
Oh, because of the water leak.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.209
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:47.292 --> 23:50.791
He, uh, called in a favor,
so here we are.

23:50.875 --> 23:52.666
So, you guys work together, or...

23:52.750 --> 23:55.417
No, no, no.
We're friends from way back.

23:57.541 --> 23:59.666
Wait a minute,
did you serve together in the Marines?

23:59.750 --> 24:02.334
- <i>Semper Fi.</i>
- Hoorah.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.209
All right... Marines.

24:04.292 --> 24:07.708
Um, well, let me know
if you need anything, okay?

24:07.791 --> 24:09.541
- Yeah, will do. Thanks.
- Okay.

24:09.625 --> 24:14.625
Hey, um, did he happen to mention
where's he's moving?

24:14.708 --> 24:17.167
Was it the Newton house?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.541
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.250
I think that's the one.

24:21.875 --> 24:23.083
Yeah?

24:23.666 --> 24:25.625
All right.
Be sure to lock up.

24:27.750 --> 24:29.209
Take care.

25:10.917 --> 25:13.792
- This a company safe house?
- Ah, used to be.

25:14.917 --> 25:17.209
Nobody's stepping foot
in this neighborhood anymore.

25:18.167 --> 25:19.417
Come on.

25:21.292 --> 25:22.875
You gotta go pee-pee, huh?

25:23.042 --> 25:24.750
You gotta go
pee-pee poo-poo?

25:24.833 --> 25:27.292
You gotta go pee-pee?
All right, come on.

25:27.375 --> 25:30.000
Someday
you're gonna have to learn how to walk.

25:31.250 --> 25:33.000
Looks like someone's
growing on you.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.625
Less needy than the ex.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.583
Oh, uh, your buddy
Tom Carter called again.

25:36.666 --> 25:37.833
What now?

25:37.917 --> 25:40.458
He's complaining about his nickname
and nobody wants to arrest him.

25:41.167 --> 25:43.125
Didn't Hall and Nivens
follow up on him?

25:44.708 --> 25:47.750
They must be from
the "orders are optional" generation.

26:11.416 --> 26:13.250
I'll meet you outside.
I gotta hit the head.

26:13.334 --> 26:14.583
All right, cool.

26:56.541 --> 26:57.958
What took so long?

26:58.541 --> 27:00.042
Did you find it?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.875
We did. Right where you said
it would be.

27:03.958 --> 27:05.375
Let's have a chat.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.875
So, do we have a deal?

27:13.541 --> 27:15.708
I, uh, hear you're a Marine.

27:18.125 --> 27:21.625
- How many times you ship out?
- Quite a few, actually.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.042
Guess that makes you
kind of dangerous, huh?

27:26.625 --> 27:28.667
What's with the gloves?

27:34.125 --> 27:35.541
- Whoa, whoa, hey.
- Pick it up.

27:35.625 --> 27:36.708
I'm turning myself in.

27:43.292 --> 27:44.500
I said pick it up.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.000
This isn't what we talked about.

27:53.084 --> 27:54.209
Did you count it?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.084
The cash.

27:56.708 --> 27:57.833
Did you count it?

27:58.708 --> 28:00.416
What would've happened
if I'd counted it?

28:00.500 --> 28:03.209
When you got to three million,
you would've run out of money.

28:03.291 --> 28:04.500
Bullshit.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.667
Figured I might need
a bargaining chip.

28:08.084 --> 28:09.416
Seems I was right.

28:10.500 --> 28:11.833
Three's a lot of money.

28:11.917 --> 28:14.084
Yeah, but nine sounds better,
doesn't it?

28:18.917 --> 28:22.375
Okay. Suppose you're right.
Where's the other six?

28:25.291 --> 28:26.541
You expecting company?

28:29.792 --> 28:32.667
Special Agent Sam Baker, FBI.
Open up, Carter.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.625
What do I do?

28:42.416 --> 28:43.625
Open the door.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.750
Just a second.

28:47.291 --> 28:48.375
Ah.

28:50.333 --> 28:53.291
You got five minutes, and
the clock's already ticking.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.000
Open up.

28:59.541 --> 29:01.000
Open the door, Carter.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.167
All right, go.

29:19.542 --> 29:20.750
Oh.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.959
- You guys handling this?
- Sir.

29:24.708 --> 29:26.042
Let me by.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.291
What's with the 9mm?

29:52.208 --> 29:53.208
What exactly...

30:13.375 --> 30:15.250
Go! Go, get outta here!

30:19.834 --> 30:21.917
Go! Move! Come on!

30:29.542 --> 30:30.583
Shoot him!

30:34.500 --> 30:35.625
Get down!

30:40.333 --> 30:41.667
Get in!

30:45.000 --> 30:47.750
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

30:48.125 --> 30:49.375
Who's shooting at us?

30:50.917 --> 30:53.000
- FBI.
- FBI?

30:57.750 --> 30:59.542
I can't believe you shot Baker.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.291
Hey, you need to cut that out, all right?
Wake up!

31:02.375 --> 31:05.042
I didn't shoot Baker, Carter did.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.000
What the hell are you doing with that?
That's evidence!

31:08.084 --> 31:10.333
Carter took my Sig.

31:11.792 --> 31:13.667
- You have a gun?
- It's not mine.

31:14.750 --> 31:15.959
What did you do, Tom?

31:17.291 --> 31:20.500
- Tell me what you did.
- I will, Annie, I promise.

31:21.542 --> 31:23.625
But first,
we have to ditch this car.

31:23.708 --> 31:26.542
- This is your Jeep.
- Not anymore.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.208
There he is.

31:42.750 --> 31:43.750
Look out!

32:45.417 --> 32:47.458
- Anything?
- They can't be far.

34:47.250 --> 34:48.375
I can explain.

34:53.542 --> 34:55.083
The In-and-Out Bandit?

34:55.166 --> 34:57.208
I haven't robbed a bank
in over a year.

34:58.041 --> 35:00.792
In fact, I haven't so much
as jaywalked since I met you.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.458
- Well, you just hot-wired a car.
- Okay, until tonight.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.750
This is insane.

35:08.292 --> 35:10.166
Listen to me.
You have to turn yourself in.

35:10.250 --> 35:12.500
That's what I was trying to do.

35:12.584 --> 35:14.500
That's what I've been wanting
to tell you, but...

35:15.792 --> 35:17.000
I didn't have the courage.

35:17.417 --> 35:18.584
Wait, wait, wait.

35:18.667 --> 35:19.750
The first surprise was,

35:19.834 --> 35:22.458
"Let's get a cute house
in Newton and move in together,"

35:22.542 --> 35:24.375
and the second was
you're a bank robber?

35:24.458 --> 35:28.875
I just felt if you and I were gonna
have a chance at a life together,

35:28.958 --> 35:31.584
which I want
even more than you know,

35:32.292 --> 35:34.542
I needed to come clean
to the Feds and to you.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.667
And you just assumed
that I'd be okay with this?

35:36.750 --> 35:40.458
I was hoping once you knew
the whole story, you'd be understanding.

35:40.542 --> 35:41.958
We both know we're good together.

35:42.041 --> 35:44.041
That was before
I knew you were a bank robber.

35:44.125 --> 35:45.792
I'm not a bank robber anymore.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.292
I need some air.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.333
- Pull the car over, Tom!
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:23.542 --> 36:25.125
How many people have you killed?

36:25.750 --> 36:27.916
No one.
Not even in the Marines.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.916
You made bombs. Bombs kill people.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.208
I didn't make bombs.
I disarmed land mines.

36:34.875 --> 36:37.625
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

36:39.125 --> 36:40.542
I didn't lie, Annie.

36:40.625 --> 36:44.041
I just didn't tell you certain things.

36:45.542 --> 36:48.625
I considered just keeping my mouth shut,
keeping the money,

36:48.709 --> 36:51.333
but I knew that secret would

36:51.417 --> 36:56.208
eat me up inside
and hurt what you and I have.

36:56.292 --> 36:57.916
So, the house, were you gonna...

36:58.000 --> 36:59.750
You gonna pay for that
with stolen money?

36:59.833 --> 37:03.167
No. I had money
saved up from when I was in the service.

37:03.250 --> 37:05.167
And the safe business...

37:05.791 --> 37:07.167
That wasn't a real job?

37:14.083 --> 37:15.916
So, what else have you been
lying to me about?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.250
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

37:19.542 --> 37:20.709
Well,

37:21.667 --> 37:26.167
except, there was no water leak
in my apartment, and, uh...

37:27.417 --> 37:31.542
I don't like the health cookies you make,
even though I say I do.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.584
And I agree the house needs paint,

37:33.667 --> 37:35.958
but I hate yellow.

37:39.542 --> 37:40.833
Paint.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.916
Cookies? Water leaks?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.958
Okay, this is not the honesty
that I'm looking for, okay?

37:47.042 --> 37:49.916
Right now, I'm trying to determine
if you're a pathological liar,

37:50.000 --> 37:52.708
or a complete sociopath!

37:52.791 --> 37:54.542
I'm none of the above.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.167
Why?

38:12.250 --> 38:14.125
Why did you rob banks?

38:17.167 --> 38:20.167
My mother died of pneumonia
while I was in a dust bowl

38:20.250 --> 38:22.167
fighting somebody else's war.

38:24.250 --> 38:27.791
When I got back, my dad
was half the man he was when I left.

38:28.334 --> 38:30.584
He was depressed, lonely.

38:32.292 --> 38:33.542
He missed her.

38:35.708 --> 38:39.459
He was a welder for a pipe manufacturer
for over 35 years.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.584
Dedicated company man.

38:42.625 --> 38:45.375
But he started having a hard time

38:45.459 --> 38:48.625
finding a reason to get up
in the morning and go to work.

38:50.625 --> 38:53.916
His productivity slipped,
and they fired him.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.500
But the worst of it was,
the CEO embezzled millions

38:58.584 --> 39:01.042
from the employee pension fund,

39:02.250 --> 39:04.042
denying my father his pension.

39:05.708 --> 39:09.542
He didn't have it in him
to deal with lawyers and fight it.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.875
Instead, he drove
his Chevy Silverado...

39:16.208 --> 39:19.459
60 miles an hour
into an oak tree.

39:21.625 --> 39:23.125
No skid marks.

39:24.666 --> 39:27.250
A month later,
I walked into the same bank

39:27.334 --> 39:29.292
where the CEO kept his money...

39:32.042 --> 39:35.791
And I robbed it.
$658,000.

39:36.542 --> 39:39.208
More than my old man
made in his lifetime.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.583
I never spent one dime of it.

39:45.500 --> 39:47.208
Then why did you keep doing it?

39:48.042 --> 39:50.500
It wasn't about the money.
It just...

39:51.542 --> 39:54.208
Just felt good.

39:54.292 --> 39:59.083
Like when I was sweeping for mines,
not knowing if my next step was my last.

40:00.958 --> 40:03.875
Made me feel alive.

40:06.375 --> 40:07.958
And then I met you.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.917
Somehow, you gave me
that same feeling

40:11.000 --> 40:14.500
of being alive, so I stopped.

40:16.417 --> 40:17.791
You stopped for me?

40:19.541 --> 40:20.750
Yes.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.958
The more time I spent with you,
the more I realized

40:25.583 --> 40:29.917
what I needed in my life
wasn't money or an adrenaline rush,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.500
it was the need to feel love.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.875
And I feel that with you.

40:41.334 --> 40:42.708
So there it is.

40:48.375 --> 40:49.666
We should go, huh?

41:05.875 --> 41:07.250
Out. Out.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.958
I'm sorry, my friend.

41:19.292 --> 41:21.042
This is not how it was supposed to go.

41:23.625 --> 41:26.292
But I promise you,
I will find whoever did this to you.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.917
Where's Nivens and Hall?

41:32.000 --> 41:33.958
The FBI guy you were fighting?

41:34.042 --> 41:35.375
Yeah.

41:35.459 --> 41:39.250
I saw him and another guy
taking boxes out of your storage unit.

41:39.334 --> 41:40.334
The money.

41:40.417 --> 41:42.625
I was giving it back
in exchange for a deal

41:42.708 --> 41:44.917
that wouldn't keep me away
from you for very long.

41:45.292 --> 41:47.958
But then those two
stole the cash and tried to kill me.

41:48.666 --> 41:50.792
What's worse, those gunshots you heard,

41:50.875 --> 41:54.792
it was them shooting another agent,
which I'm sure they'll pin on me.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.458
Your word against theirs.

41:56.541 --> 41:59.250
Not a judge in the world
is gonna believe me over them.

42:00.042 --> 42:02.833
And with a murder one charge
for killing one of their own,

42:02.917 --> 42:06.125
the Feds will come after me,
and keep coming until they find me.

42:06.792 --> 42:09.083
If you're with me,
they'll charge you as an accessory.

42:09.958 --> 42:11.458
I won't let that happen.

42:12.209 --> 42:13.792
I'm dropping you off
at the next corner.

42:13.875 --> 42:16.541
You wait five minutes, call 911,

42:16.625 --> 42:18.541
tell them I forced you
into the car as a hostage,

42:18.625 --> 42:20.292
but you fought me off and got away.

42:20.375 --> 42:24.167
- No, I'm not lying to the police, Tom!
- Okay!

42:24.583 --> 42:27.084
You need to get as far away from the city
as possible.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.084
I'm putting you on a bus.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.167
A bus?

42:31.708 --> 42:34.042
Baker was already down
when we got back.

42:34.167 --> 42:36.292
The second we get in the room,
Carter jumps us.

42:37.750 --> 42:39.708
We should've been on it,
for sure, but...

42:41.416 --> 42:42.917
He caught us by surprise.

42:43.666 --> 42:46.750
- Then what?
- Then he took off in a Jeep.

42:46.833 --> 42:49.833
He was with a woman,
but I didn't get a good look at her.

42:49.917 --> 42:51.084
You?

43:00.167 --> 43:02.084
And nothing turned up
at the storage unit?

43:02.167 --> 43:03.583
Like a decade's worth of crap.

43:03.666 --> 43:05.375
So, if there was no money,

43:05.458 --> 43:07.375
and this guy is just another nutjob,

43:07.833 --> 43:11.084
how did a routine interview turn into
me having to go knock on Sam Baker's door

43:11.167 --> 43:13.375
and tell his wife
that he's never coming home?

43:14.750 --> 43:16.042
Ask Carter.

43:16.125 --> 43:18.292
If they are willing to kill another agent,

43:18.375 --> 43:20.958
what are they capable
of doing to you and me?

43:23.875 --> 43:25.750
You just can't do this to a person!

43:26.125 --> 43:28.917
I know, Annie. I...

43:30.084 --> 43:31.625
I know.

43:36.292 --> 43:37.708
I don't deserve this.

43:40.833 --> 43:42.000
When you get
to the city,

43:42.084 --> 43:44.500
find an out-of-the-way place
to stay.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.958
Hotel, motel, doesn't matter.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.167
As long as they take cash.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.958
Do not give them your real name.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.541
When you're settled,
call me from a pay phone.

43:56.042 --> 43:57.250
Annie.

43:58.416 --> 44:00.250
I lied about what I did,

44:01.292 --> 44:03.000
but not about
how I feel about you,

44:03.084 --> 44:04.792
what I wanted for us.

44:06.042 --> 44:08.583
I loved you from the moment
you walked up to that counter.

44:08.667 --> 44:10.125
That'll never change.

44:10.792 --> 44:13.250
I'll always love you,
no matter what happens.

44:29.708 --> 44:32.125
If they had accepted your deal
and you went to prison,

44:32.209 --> 44:33.833
I would've waited for you.

44:38.291 --> 44:40.084
I feel like I'm never gonna see you again.

44:40.167 --> 44:41.833
You will, I promise.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.084
Come with me.
Come with me, Tom.

44:52.167 --> 44:53.792
Come on, we can have
everything we talked about.

44:53.875 --> 44:55.416
Maybe in New York.
I don't know, maybe...

44:55.500 --> 44:57.625
I don't know, just come with me.
Get on the bus with me.

44:57.708 --> 45:00.209
Annie, I can't. I have to do this.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.708
Okay.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.500
Okay.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.583
Then prove it, Tom.

45:19.125 --> 45:21.042
Prove that you didn't kill that man.

46:46.667 --> 46:47.667
We, uh...

46:48.875 --> 46:51.583
We lifted Carter's fingerprints
from the hotel.

46:53.166 --> 46:55.834
His real name is, uh,
Thomas James Dolan.

46:55.917 --> 46:58.166
- Ex-con?
- No, he's clean.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.959
We got a match from his military record.

47:01.542 --> 47:04.792
Former Marine, a lifer.
Demolitions expert,

47:05.208 --> 47:08.375
which would explain
his proficiency in blowing safes.

47:08.458 --> 47:10.042
But he retired nine years ago.

47:18.208 --> 47:20.959
If this guy were the In-and-Out Bandit,
that would make him a civilian

47:21.042 --> 47:22.875
about a year before
the first bank robbery.

47:22.959 --> 47:24.416
Yeah, well,
my guess is he's been reading

47:24.500 --> 47:28.375
too many In-and-Out Bandit news stories
and PTSD's taken care of the rest.

47:28.458 --> 47:29.875
He seem crazy to you?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.375
- Yeah, he did.
- What about the girl?

47:35.834 --> 47:36.875
What about her?

47:36.959 --> 47:38.875
A camera picked her up
outside the hotel.

47:38.959 --> 47:40.458
We pulled the registration from her car.

47:40.542 --> 47:41.875
Divorced a few years ago.

47:41.959 --> 47:44.042
Filed for bankruptcy
after her husband bled

47:44.125 --> 47:47.000
their furniture business dry
with a gambling habit.

47:47.625 --> 47:51.000
You know, between her ex and,
uh, this wannabe bank robber,

47:51.667 --> 47:53.875
seems to me she's not
very good at picking winners.

47:54.834 --> 47:56.083
Who am I to judge?

47:57.542 --> 47:59.917
Hard to know what her involvement
in all this might be, but

48:00.000 --> 48:02.291
she must know something,
so let's find her.

48:02.375 --> 48:04.750
- What's her name?
- Annie Wilkins.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.125
We're on it.

48:17.542 --> 48:19.417
- Annie.
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

48:19.500 --> 48:20.834
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:20.917 --> 48:24.125
I said to use a pay phone.
You're in New York, yeah?

48:24.208 --> 48:26.750
<i>The two FBI guys,
they're on a security camera</i>

48:26.834 --> 48:29.750
<i>unloading boxes out of your storage unit
and putting them into their car.</i>

48:29.834 --> 48:31.417
<i>That's proof that they stole the money.</i>

48:32.125 --> 48:34.500
Maybe, but how do you know
they're on camera?

48:35.250 --> 48:36.542
Annie, where are you?

48:36.625 --> 48:39.041
{\an8}- Work.
- <i>You got off the bus?</i>

48:39.125 --> 48:41.250
There's a back-up memory card
that records over itself

48:41.333 --> 48:43.083
every 48 hours.
I had to come get it.

48:43.375 --> 48:44.583
Listen to me.

48:45.166 --> 48:48.834
Please hang up
and get out of there right now.

48:53.500 --> 48:56.041
- <i>911, please hold.</i>
- It's an emergency.

48:56.125 --> 48:57.709
<i>Please hold.</i>

49:08.000 --> 49:10.208
Annie. There you are.

49:11.375 --> 49:12.792
Your boyfriend here?

49:13.500 --> 49:14.959
He's not my boyfriend.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.041
Oh.

49:17.792 --> 49:19.250
Oh, you, uh...

49:19.625 --> 49:21.000
Just rob banks together?

49:22.583 --> 49:24.166
I don't know what you're talking about.

49:29.375 --> 49:31.792
He's got six million dollars
tucked away somewhere.

49:31.875 --> 49:33.458
You got any idea where that might be?

49:34.709 --> 49:35.834
You hiding it for him?

49:35.917 --> 49:39.125
Maybe in, uh, another one
of these units here?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.959
Where's the memory card
for this? Under here?

49:49.792 --> 49:50.959
No!

49:54.208 --> 49:56.375
That's not the answer
I was looking for.

49:58.917 --> 49:59.917
Where is it, huh?

50:02.208 --> 50:04.625
- Is it in here?
- No, it's not in there.

50:04.709 --> 50:05.792
No?

50:05.875 --> 50:07.625
It's in the drawer on the right.

50:09.875 --> 50:11.000
In here?

50:16.417 --> 50:18.958
You know, lying to me
is not gonna turn out well.

50:49.500 --> 50:51.500
- What the...
- She was a witness.

50:51.584 --> 50:53.208
Was? Is she dead?

50:53.292 --> 50:54.875
No, she's not.
She's about to be.

50:54.958 --> 50:56.916
Stop! You...
You can't just shoot people.

51:01.667 --> 51:03.500
- I think she's dead.
- You think?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.250
I don't feel a pulse.

51:05.333 --> 51:07.250
We need to get the memory card
for the security cameras.

51:07.333 --> 51:10.417
- It's probably on her.
- Don't touch anything else!

51:10.500 --> 51:12.792
You take care of that.
I got this.

51:18.834 --> 51:19.958
Are you sure
there was a memory card?

51:20.041 --> 51:21.875
I don't know! There's gotta be!

51:24.667 --> 51:25.834
It's not here!

51:31.083 --> 51:32.542
We gotta get outta here.

51:48.584 --> 51:51.166
Jesus! God, Annie! Annie!

51:51.250 --> 51:52.667
Come on, Annie. Come on.

52:00.625 --> 52:03.417
Help! Hello!
I need some help here!

52:03.500 --> 52:04.916
- Get a gurney!
- Please!

52:05.000 --> 52:06.667
- What happened?
- I don't know. It's her head.

52:06.750 --> 52:08.500
Okay. Get her on an IV, saline.

52:08.584 --> 52:09.625
Honey,
you're gonna be fine.

52:09.709 --> 52:12.333
Get a CVC, type and cross.
I need an EKG and CT.

52:12.417 --> 52:13.709
- You're gonna be fine.
- Let's move.

52:13.792 --> 52:16.542
Sir, I need some information.
What's the patient's name?

52:17.500 --> 52:18.500
- Sir, what's the patient's name?
- Wilkins.

52:18.584 --> 52:19.958
Wilkins. Annie Wilkins.

52:20.041 --> 52:21.750
Is she allergic
to any medication?

52:21.833 --> 52:22.833
Uh...

52:23.417 --> 52:24.625
Not that I know of.

52:25.709 --> 52:27.292
What's your relation to her?

52:27.375 --> 52:28.833
I'm, uh...

52:30.041 --> 52:32.208
Are you hurt, sir?
Are you... Um...

52:32.292 --> 52:35.000
What? No. This isn't my blood.

52:35.083 --> 52:36.208
- Thank you.
- Sir!

52:37.709 --> 52:38.709
Sir!

52:43.458 --> 52:46.167
<i>Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?</i>

52:57.916 --> 52:59.167
Oh, man.

53:01.958 --> 53:03.167
It's Meyers.

53:05.875 --> 53:06.916
Shit.

53:08.292 --> 53:11.459
Nivens, Dolan's on the line
asking for you.

53:11.542 --> 53:13.292
We've already initiated a trace.

53:13.750 --> 53:15.167
All right, put that prick on.

53:16.625 --> 53:18.625
I tried to turn myself in.

53:19.208 --> 53:21.125
I handed you three million dollars.

53:21.750 --> 53:24.000
- What are you talking about?
- My girlfriend! Why?

53:24.083 --> 53:26.625
- <i>She had nothing to do with this.</i>
- <i>Girlfriend?</i>

53:27.750 --> 53:29.083
You lost me, buddy.

53:31.833 --> 53:33.083
You there?

53:36.167 --> 53:37.167
Dolan?

53:38.208 --> 53:41.500
Agent Nivens, I'm coming for you.

53:52.750 --> 53:53.958
You believe this guy?

53:55.250 --> 53:56.750
What I can't believe is you.

53:59.041 --> 54:00.333
Oh, is that so?

54:02.292 --> 54:04.083
Well, don't go getting
any brave ideas.

54:04.958 --> 54:06.208
We're in this together.

54:11.584 --> 54:12.584
You got a trace?

54:12.667 --> 54:14.000
No. It wasn't long enough.

54:14.083 --> 54:17.375
But a black and white spotted him
leaving Grace Hospital in a stolen van...

54:17.833 --> 54:19.459
After he dropped off his girlfriend.

54:20.292 --> 54:21.459
What happened to her?

54:21.542 --> 54:23.375
I don't know,
but I'm heading there now.

55:08.167 --> 55:10.833
I got a visual on the suspect.
Light blue Ford Econoline,

55:10.916 --> 55:12.125
plate number 17...

55:26.375 --> 55:28.625
<i>In pursuit northbound on Webster.</i>

55:29.417 --> 55:30.500
Make a right.

55:55.375 --> 55:58.542
I lost him. He's headed
westbound on Lincoln.

56:08.167 --> 56:09.459
Shit.

56:46.583 --> 56:47.583
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, shit!

57:32.750 --> 57:33.958
Fuck!

59:07.750 --> 59:10.250
You killed my partner!
You son of a bitch!

59:11.292 --> 59:14.666
Wrong! You got it wrong!

59:29.209 --> 59:30.416
Don't do it!

59:32.042 --> 59:34.042
I didn't kill Baker.
It was Nivens.

59:34.125 --> 59:35.625
He shot him point-blank.

59:36.250 --> 59:38.167
And my lady friend,
he went after her.

59:38.250 --> 59:39.750
I don't know
if she's alive or dead.

59:41.458 --> 59:43.583
Nivens put her in the hospital?

59:43.666 --> 59:45.458
He attacked her
at the self-storage on Milton.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.666
- And why would he do that?
- She has evidence against him.

59:53.750 --> 59:55.583
You wanna do the right thing
right now?

59:56.334 --> 59:58.833
You drop the gun
and let me take you in.

59:58.917 --> 01:00:01.334
We'll do it the proper way.
I'll make sure the truth comes out.

01:00:01.583 --> 01:00:02.750
I give you my word.

01:00:07.541 --> 01:00:08.625
What's your name?

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:10.708
Meyers.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.416
I talked to you
on the phone, didn't I?

01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:15.209
Yeah.

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:20.375
- What are you thinking, Tom?
- I'm gonna make things right.

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:21.792
My way.

01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:23.334
Nivens pulled the trigger,

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:26.500
but his partner, Agent Hall,
he's in on it, too.

01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:28.500
This is his.

01:01:21.084 --> 01:01:22.750
<i>Information.
How my I help you?</i>

01:01:22.833 --> 01:01:24.375
Grace Hospital, please.

01:01:24.458 --> 01:01:25.917
<i>Okay, would you like me to connect you?</i>

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.875
Yes, yes, please connect me.

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:30.792
<i>Grace Hospital.</i>

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:33.291
Hi. I'm looking for Annie Wilkins.

01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:34.500
- <i>Wilkins?</i>
- Wilkins.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:36.708
- <i>Wilkins.</i>
- Yes. She's a patient.

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.416
- <i>I'll connect you.</i>
- Thank you.

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:44.500
- Hello. Is this Annie's room?
- <i>Yes.</i>

01:01:45.209 --> 01:01:47.583
Great. Can she talk?

01:01:47.667 --> 01:01:49.500
Yes, yes, I'm family.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.917
<i>She can't talk right now...</i>

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.708
But she's... she's okay?
She'll get better, right?

01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:04.375
Oh, good. No, no, that's fine.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:06.291
I'll, uh, call back later.

01:02:07.042 --> 01:02:08.625
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:25.250
What are we doing here?

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:29.042
Well, we need to make sure
she didn't make it.

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.708
And since you're the one
who said she didn't have a pulse,

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.416
you're gonna do it.

01:02:36.416 --> 01:02:37.542
No.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.625
No, no chance.

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:43.500
This has gone way too far.
I don't want any part of this.

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:46.625
Fine.

01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:55.458
But don't blame me
if your kids hate their father,

01:02:55.542 --> 01:02:57.583
'cause he wasn't there
when they were growing up.

01:04:16.042 --> 01:04:17.250
Looking for me?

01:04:17.959 --> 01:04:19.959
Yeah. Where's your partner?

01:04:20.875 --> 01:04:22.042
On his way.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.917
Come on in. Take a seat.

01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:31.166
What's with the leg?

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:33.375
Just got thrown
out of a second-story window.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.708
You, uh, plan on getting rid of this?

01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:41.583
Kind of morbid.

01:04:41.667 --> 01:04:42.959
Call it motivation.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:45.042
Tell me something.

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:47.583
This Tom Dolan,

01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:49.500
why is he pointing a finger at you?

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:54.083
I mean, why do any of these crazies
do the things they do?

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.458
Don't you hate that?

01:04:58.792 --> 01:05:00.750
Ask a question,
you get a question in return?

01:05:01.708 --> 01:05:03.333
All those things he said on the phone,

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:06.458
stealing the money, attacking his girl,
none of that's true?

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:07.917
Not a bit.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.542
- Where's the money?
- What money?

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:15.959
The money
my partner died for.

01:05:17.458 --> 01:05:20.667
The money that made
Sharon Baker a widow.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.125
Well, that money
is in Tom Dolan's head.

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:26.250
He's got a first-class imagination.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.417
- You needed to see me?
- Yeah.

01:05:31.917 --> 01:05:33.291
I believe you lost this.

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.208
Thanks.

01:05:43.667 --> 01:05:45.291
- Uh, anything else?
- No, we're good.

01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:51.333
John, you, uh...

01:05:52.709 --> 01:05:54.041
You got a new plan?

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:00.375
Same plan, family man.

01:06:03.625 --> 01:06:05.291
That some kind of threat?

01:06:08.166 --> 01:06:09.458
Does it need to be?

01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:51.125
What's wrong?

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.000
You awake?

01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:58.292
I can feel your energy.
Tell me.

01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:01.375
Nothing.

01:07:01.792 --> 01:07:03.208
It's just work stuff.

01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:04.750
Go back to sleep.

01:07:05.667 --> 01:07:09.208
Whatever it is, just do what feels right,
and it'll work itself out.

01:07:10.917 --> 01:07:12.125
That easy, huh?

01:07:12.834 --> 01:07:13.958
Yeah.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:16.333
You remember who taught me that?

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.417
No.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.125
You.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:35.375
It's just I realized I work too much.

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:38.584
All I've been trying to do
is give us a good life.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:42.208
You know I love you
and the boys more than anything.

01:07:42.292 --> 01:07:43.375
Of course I know.

01:07:45.584 --> 01:07:47.124
No matter what happens,

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.416
I just want you and the boys
to remember that.

01:07:52.333 --> 01:07:53.542
What's going on, Ramon?

01:08:20.709 --> 01:08:22.165
You gonna kill me?

01:08:22.250 --> 01:08:23.957
No, Agent Hall.

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:27.542
I'm a retired bank robber,
not a murderer like your partner!

01:08:27.624 --> 01:08:30.375
- But I do need your help!
- Why should I help you?

01:08:30.457 --> 01:08:32.292
Because you have the most to lose.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.041
You and I both know
this wasn't your doing.

01:08:44.874 --> 01:08:46.500
But going along with Nivens,

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.374
that was a bad idea.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.625
It wasn't supposed
to go down like this.

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:58.040
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

01:08:58.124 --> 01:09:00.457
But Nivens shot Baker, and I panicked.

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.916
I knew I was wrong,

01:09:03.957 --> 01:09:05.625
but at that point, I had no choice.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:08.000
Well, you have a choice now, pal.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.584
What do you want?

01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:12.292
To prove my innocence!

01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:15.875
I have the security footage
from the storage place.

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:18.542
- What?
- Nivens doesn't know I have it.

01:09:20.292 --> 01:09:22.292
I took it off your girlfriend
when he wasn't looking.

01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.875
I'm gonna need that.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:26.709
And I need to know where the money is.

01:09:33.292 --> 01:09:34.292
Annie.

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.041
That's your girlfriend's name, right?

01:09:37.125 --> 01:09:38.542
Yeah.

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:40.542
You gotta get her out of the hospital.

01:09:41.417 --> 01:09:42.875
He's gonna kill her.

01:10:38.958 --> 01:10:41.667
- Hey. You're awake.
- Tom.

01:10:43.916 --> 01:10:45.292
How you feeling?

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:48.208
I've been better.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.250
I need to get you
out of here right away.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:53.916
You're not safe.

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:58.833
Okay.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.208
I love you.

01:11:17.125 --> 01:11:18.417
How could you not?

01:11:28.292 --> 01:11:30.167
Hold on. Hold on.

01:11:31.875 --> 01:11:34.125
- Meyers.
- <i>It's Tom Dolan.</i>

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.958
I didn't expect that,
you kidnapping your girlfriend.

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:39.666
She wasn't safe there.

01:11:40.584 --> 01:11:41.833
You might be right.

01:11:41.916 --> 01:11:43.417
Is she holed up
somewhere safe now?

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.916
Yeah. I want you to know
she had nothing to do with the robberies

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.500
and she will have
nothing to do with what comes next.

01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:51.750
What comes next?

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:53.083
<i>It's better if you don't know.</i>

01:11:53.167 --> 01:11:54.500
No, it's my job to know, Tom.

01:11:54.584 --> 01:11:57.708
Come on, let's get together,
we talk this over.

01:11:57.791 --> 01:12:00.708
I'd like to, but I tried that.

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:02.958
Did not work.

01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:06.750
Now I'm doing it
the only way I know how.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.750
I can't persuade you
not to do whatever it is you're planning?

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.000
<i>No.</i>

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:17.542
You need anything, you or Annie,

01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.375
you let me know.

01:12:44.459 --> 01:12:46.292
I've never
seen you work before.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.250
Well, I know it looks complicated,

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:55.083
but it's not glamorous.
I mean, it's just wires,

01:12:56.083 --> 01:12:58.459
electrical currents, chemical reactions.

01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:00.583
Yeah, well, glamor's overrated.

01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:04.292
But knowing how to
blow stuff up, that's, uh...

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:06.875
That's pretty cool.

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:10.167
You know, if this works,

01:13:11.875 --> 01:13:14.833
you have to understand,
I'm still going to jail.

01:13:14.917 --> 01:13:16.292
I know that.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:19.625
And I'll come visit you every day.

01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:22.125
Yeah?

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.875
- I mean, you know, until I...
- start seeing patients.

01:13:27.167 --> 01:13:28.750
I'm gonna be busy.

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:31.833
Every other day.

01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:33.334
Thank you.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.417
What are you doing?

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.417
- How did it go?
- Late night, but without incident.

01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:53.083
You should be in bed.

01:13:53.666 --> 01:13:55.708
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:58.375
It's not up for debate.

01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:00.042
You're right. It's too dangerous.

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.666
Then don't do it.

01:14:01.958 --> 01:14:04.167
I have to finish this, Annie.

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:08.791
Look, do what you have to do,
but I'm sorry, I refuse to stay here

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:11.125
wondering if you're ever
gonna come back.

01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:31.417
What are we waiting for?

01:14:38.417 --> 01:14:39.708
Nivens.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:42.875
All I wanted was a chance
at a normal life for Annie and me.

01:14:43.833 --> 01:14:45.500
Well, it's a simple equation, Dolan.

01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:48.750
When you rob banks for a living,
you give up the right to a normal life.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:50.750
You're right, I screwed up.

01:14:50.833 --> 01:14:52.750
I took money that didn't belong to me.

01:14:52.833 --> 01:14:56.167
And for that, I'll do my time.
But you screwed up worse.

01:14:56.250 --> 01:14:57.541
You killed innocent people.

01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:58.708
Time's up. What do you want?

01:14:58.792 --> 01:15:00.334
You wanna talk?
You want your deal? What?

01:15:00.417 --> 01:15:02.500
I wanna clear my name,

01:15:02.583 --> 01:15:05.209
which means I need
a full confession from you.

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:06.334
<i>That's where we're at, huh?</i>

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:07.583
Well, don't you think it would be wrong

01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:09.750
for me to confess
to something I didn't do?

01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:11.583
Then you'd better
take the three million and run.

01:15:11.666 --> 01:15:15.125
Hey, pal, if I had
the three million, I might.

01:15:15.209 --> 01:15:17.750
In that case, I suggest you just run.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:19.250
Ten,

01:15:20.083 --> 01:15:22.792
<i>nine, eight,</i>

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.583
<i>seven, six,</i>

01:15:28.042 --> 01:15:29.209
<i>five,</i>

01:15:29.875 --> 01:15:31.000
four,

01:15:31.792 --> 01:15:32.792
three,

01:15:33.958 --> 01:15:35.125
<i>two,</i>

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:36.917
one.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:04.000
Nice try, asshole!

01:16:04.084 --> 01:16:06.209
If I'd wanted you dead,
you would be.

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:07.708
Ready to confess?

01:16:13.833 --> 01:16:14.958
Wow.

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:23.292
Will you do something for me?

01:16:23.833 --> 01:16:25.084
Anything.

01:16:57.625 --> 01:16:59.375
- What's up?
- <i>Change of plan.</i>

01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:01.666
What are you talking about?

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.708
Meyers, the girl,
this pyro-lunatic Dolan...

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:06.875
Pyro? What happened?

01:17:07.458 --> 01:17:09.209
He blew up my fucking house.

01:17:09.292 --> 01:17:10.292
What?

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.084
Are you deaf?
He blew up my house!

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:14.292
Holy crap.

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.084
Where are you?

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.875
I'm at the spot.

01:17:19.958 --> 01:17:21.333
All right, stay put.

01:17:22.209 --> 01:17:24.250
- I'll meet you there.
- <i>Hurry up.</i>

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.000
He's not here, is he?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.541
He's not a bad guy.

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.833
I know you may think that

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:05.250
given everything
that's happened, but he's not.

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:07.875
He's flawed, but he's a good man.

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.333
He's got a good heart.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:13.084
How are you feeling?

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:16.959
Better. Thank you.

01:18:20.458 --> 01:18:21.583
Who's your friend?

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:26.750
Oh, that's Tazzie.
She's my dog.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:29.291
Is she part of the K9 Unit?

01:18:29.375 --> 01:18:31.250
Yeah, I guess she is.

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.875
All 15 pounds of her.

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.750
Is there a reason why we're here?

01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:42.416
Security footage of Nivens and Hall
taking boxes out of this unit.

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.583
I mean, the problem is, who's to believe
what's inside those boxes?

01:18:46.333 --> 01:18:49.291
- Yeah, that is a problem.
- Tom's working on that.

01:18:49.375 --> 01:18:51.000
But as a show of good faith...

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.375
he wanted you to have these.

01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:42.750
- Yeah?
- It's me.

01:19:44.833 --> 01:19:46.291
Where the hell you been?

01:19:50.792 --> 01:19:52.416
Show me your weapon.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.708
Thumb and index finger. Slowly.

01:19:58.084 --> 01:20:00.375
Back up, both of you!

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:01.792
Against the wall.

01:20:05.458 --> 01:20:07.166
You're not walking
out of here with that money.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:08.625
Not yet, I'm not.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.834
Are you still waiting
for that confession that's never coming?

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:13.291
I've got
the security footage, prick.

01:20:13.917 --> 01:20:15.375
Yeah, sure you do.

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:16.959
Your partner gave it to me.

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:22.583
Did you have it?

01:20:27.667 --> 01:20:29.125
It was on the girl
who was supposed to be dead.

01:20:29.208 --> 01:20:31.333
Are you stupid?
You're on that footage, too!

01:20:31.416 --> 01:20:34.208
Stupid? Insane!
For going along with this.

01:20:34.416 --> 01:20:36.542
Thinking that the money
made it okay.

01:20:36.834 --> 01:20:39.084
- You murdered Baker!
- It was the only option!

01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:40.750
He didn't deserve to die!

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.792
I had a chance
to do the right thing, and I didn't do it.

01:20:44.583 --> 01:20:46.042
How can I live like that?

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:50.542
How can I look my wife
and my kids in the eyes?

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:53.834
That's enough!

01:20:57.333 --> 01:20:58.750
That's enough!

01:20:58.834 --> 01:21:01.208
Nivens, let him go!
Let him go!

01:22:13.834 --> 01:22:15.166
<i>I got you, didn't I?</i>

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.041
I'll live.

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:20.125
- How's traffic?
- <i>Traffic?</i>

01:22:20.208 --> 01:22:23.333
<i>If I recall correctly,
Windsor's down to one lane.</i>

01:22:25.959 --> 01:22:28.000
That a good guess,
or you tracking me?

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:31.083
Just wanna
keep the collateral damage to a minimum.

01:22:31.959 --> 01:22:33.250
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.500
The second bomb.

01:22:40.166 --> 01:22:42.667
- Bullshit. There is no bomb.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:46.583
What, you're gonna turn
three million in cash into confetti?

01:22:46.667 --> 01:22:47.959
I don't think so.

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:50.333
It's not my money anymore.

01:22:50.709 --> 01:22:52.250
Check under the seat.

01:23:01.041 --> 01:23:05.166
Now that you're through the tunnel,
go ahead, pull over. Take a look.

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:21.792
Shit.

01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:25.458
By the way, Agent Nivens,

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:27.875
<i>the bomb
is pressure sensitive.</i>

01:23:27.958 --> 01:23:29.083
<i>If you get out
of that seat,</i>

01:23:29.166 --> 01:23:31.667
they'll be fishing pieces
of your miserable flesh

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.250
from the Atlantic with a net.

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:37.375
<i>I put it together on the fly,
so it's fairly unstable.</i>

01:23:37.458 --> 01:23:40.709
<i>That's the trouble with IEDs,
especially homemade ones.</i>

01:23:40.792 --> 01:23:43.041
<i>You never know
what's gonna set them off.</i>

01:23:43.709 --> 01:23:46.417
A bump,
change in temperature, humidity.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.500
Hell, with that one,

01:23:47.583 --> 01:23:49.250
<i>a good sneeze could trigger it.</i>

01:23:51.917 --> 01:23:56.125
If I were you, I'd sit tight
and wait for the bomb squad.

01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:21.834
What's happened?

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:23.750
It's a dud.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.458
No detonator.

01:25:25.542 --> 01:25:27.875
You could bang that thing
with a hammer all day long,

01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:29.167
wouldn't go off.

01:25:29.833 --> 01:25:31.375
You lucked out.

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.417
Arrest him.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.250
You heard me.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:12.542
Good girl.

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.500
You want a cookie?

01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:34.125
<i>It was on the girl
who was supposed to be dead.</i>

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:36.208
<i>Are you stupid?
You're on that footage, too!</i>

01:26:36.292 --> 01:26:39.208
<i>Stupid? Insane!
For going along with this.</i>

01:26:39.292 --> 01:26:41.584
<i>Thinking that the money
made it okay.</i>

01:26:41.667 --> 01:26:44.000
- <i>You murdered Baker!</i>
- <i>It was the only option!</i>

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.750
<i>He didn't deserve to die!</i>

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:50.000
<i>I had a chance
to do the right thing, and I didn't do it.</i>

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:53.417
<i>How can I live like that?</i>

01:26:54.333 --> 01:26:57.750
<i>How can I look my wife
and my kids in the eyes?</i>

01:27:00.292 --> 01:27:01.292
<i>That's enough!</i>

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:05.292
<i>That's enough!</i>

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.250
<i>Nivens, let him go!</i>

01:27:07.875 --> 01:27:08.916
<i>Let him go!</i>

01:27:40.542 --> 01:27:42.750
- Annie.
- Did you listen to it?

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:43.875
I did.

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.542
Will you go easy on him?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.208
I'll do my best.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:56.459
It's for you.

01:28:01.916 --> 01:28:03.000
Tom?

01:28:03.708 --> 01:28:05.208
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

01:28:06.833 --> 01:28:08.875
Taking down Nivens the way you did...

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:10.833
Impressive work.

01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:13.292
Circumstances were different,
I'd be offering you a job.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:16.417
<i>Circumstances were different,
I might accept.</i>

01:28:17.791 --> 01:28:19.417
<i>I wanna turn myself in.</i>

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.791
All right. How do you wanna play it?

01:28:24.208 --> 01:28:26.000
<i>Play time's over, my friend.</i>

01:28:27.083 --> 01:28:28.334
<i>Look to your left.</i>

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.000
The bomb in Nivens' car?

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:00.250
Not my best.

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.083
You forgot the detonator.

01:29:02.208 --> 01:29:04.334
Ah, I knew I forgot something.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:07.791
I was under a lot of stress.

01:29:08.584 --> 01:29:10.584
So much for being the Precise Bandit.

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:15.750
You find the rest of the cash?

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:17.542
