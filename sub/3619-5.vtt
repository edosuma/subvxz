WEBVTT

00:09.052 --> 00:10.184
MAN:
Good morning, sir.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.144
PIPER:
This is ridiculous.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.538
We need more than
ten cases of beer.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.714
PAIGE:
But we can't keep
doing this, Phoebe,

00:18.888 --> 00:20.107
because Piper and I
actually have lives.

00:20.281 --> 00:21.673
Okay, call Phil
at the Beauty Bar

00:21.847 --> 00:23.719
and he will lend you a
couple cases of beer.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.242
I will call the
distributor tomorrow.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.939
No, Phoebe, I haven't
seen a demon or half-demon

00:27.114 --> 00:28.680
or whatever the hell he is.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.378
Yeah. I think demon-fighting
is important, but you,

00:30.552 --> 00:31.901
missy, are at home
doing research

00:32.075 --> 00:33.990
and Piper and I are here
on the front lines.

00:34.164 --> 00:37.385
I gotta go.
I gotta go. Bye.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.736
Why is it every time Phoebe
runs away from a guy,

00:40.910 --> 00:42.520
that weactually pay for it?

00:42.694 --> 00:43.956
I know. She sleeps with Leslie

00:44.131 --> 00:45.610
and suddenly she's got us
chasing demons

00:45.784 --> 00:47.917
all over town
while P3 falls apart.

00:48.091 --> 00:49.788
And she has to get
her active powers back

00:49.962 --> 00:51.573
because we can't keep
picking up the slack.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.879
I wish the demon would
hurry up and attack already.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.490
You know, it's okay.

00:55.664 --> 00:56.665
I cast a protection spell
on the innocents,

00:56.839 --> 00:58.014
so, it should
be all right.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.015
Excuse me?

00:59.189 --> 01:00.495
You did what?

01:00.669 --> 01:02.366
I cast a protection spell

01:02.540 --> 01:04.934
because, you know, you can't
keep watching them all the time.

01:05.108 --> 01:06.022
Paige, protection spells
backfire.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.546
That's why we don't use them.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.200
Don't worry about it.
I got the spell

01:10.374 --> 01:11.549
from my best grad student--
I'm all over it.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.812
Well, it better be,

01:13.986 --> 01:15.466
because the chaplain's
on the move.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.557
Whoa.

01:19.731 --> 01:20.863
He's going in alone.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.343
Come on. Put that down.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.909
I have to put
my shoes on.

01:25.998 --> 01:29.219
Come to pray,
have you, Arthur?

01:31.526 --> 01:32.614
Who's that?

01:35.530 --> 01:36.574
Kevin?

01:36.748 --> 01:38.446
That's actually my human name.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.969
Human?!

01:41.623 --> 01:42.928
But what's happened?

01:43.103 --> 01:44.974
This?

01:45.148 --> 01:46.541
It's just a little ritual

01:46.715 --> 01:47.629
I've been performing
to reveal

01:47.803 --> 01:48.804
who I truly am.

01:48.978 --> 01:52.024
Or... who I hope to be. Soon.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.504
What are you, what are
you talking about?

01:53.678 --> 01:55.463
My real name is Sirk.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.378
From my father's side.

01:57.552 --> 01:58.770
He was a demon.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.772
And I will be complete,

02:00.946 --> 02:02.948
as soon as I've eliminated

02:03.123 --> 02:05.690
the last of my human lineage.

02:07.736 --> 02:11.000
And that's where you come in.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.135
[screams]

02:17.963 --> 02:19.748
Ouch.

02:20.618 --> 02:23.012
Oh, that really stings.

02:23.186 --> 02:23.969
[screams]

02:26.711 --> 02:29.410
How many powers
does this guy have?

02:29.584 --> 02:30.715
PAIGE:
Arthur, get down!

02:30.889 --> 02:33.675
What?

02:33.849 --> 02:35.198
Fireball!

02:51.127 --> 02:52.955
Nice protection spell, sis.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.754
♪ I am the son ♪

03:09.928 --> 03:13.932

03:54.712 --> 03:56.540
How did this happen?!

03:56.714 --> 03:58.803
Uh, actually, we're
not really sure.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.414
Would you mind covering up?

04:00.588 --> 04:01.806
It's a little
unnerving.

04:03.982 --> 04:06.420
But...

04:06.594 --> 04:07.856
...how am I still alive?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.901
You see, I kind of cast
a protection spell.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.163
You cast a what?!

04:11.338 --> 04:12.904
Already been
there, done that.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.210
A spell?

04:14.384 --> 04:15.733
PHOEBE:
Yeah, but the spell

04:15.907 --> 04:18.693
she cast was clearly
a very, very bad idea.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.434
PAIGE:
I had to do something.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.566
We couldn't just sit around
and wait for demons to attack,

04:22.740 --> 04:24.916
because, you know, Piper and I
actually have lives.

04:25.090 --> 04:25.787
Don't drag me into this.

04:25.961 --> 04:26.831
What?

04:27.005 --> 04:28.746
We agreed that

04:28.920 --> 04:30.879
the only reason we are out
hunting for demons constantly

04:31.053 --> 04:33.577
is because Phoebe won't deal
with her Leslie issues.

04:33.751 --> 04:35.579
Wait, I have Leslie issues?

04:35.753 --> 04:37.102
LEO:
Okay, you guys,
we have issues

04:37.277 --> 04:38.452
right now, with the chaplain.

04:38.626 --> 04:39.888
I have to get out of here.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.063
I got to find my wife.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.107
Uh...

04:42.282 --> 04:43.413
Uh, Paige, would you mind?

04:43.587 --> 04:45.067
[sighs]

04:45.241 --> 04:47.330
Can't have him running around
San Francisco like that

04:47.504 --> 04:48.592
with Agent Brody
snooping around.

04:48.766 --> 04:50.594
[gasps]

04:51.595 --> 04:54.337
What are you people?

04:54.511 --> 04:55.643
We're witches.

04:55.817 --> 04:57.471
It's okay. Just relax.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.125
PAIGE:
Look, my spell got
us into this mess,

05:00.300 --> 05:01.779
I'll figure out
a way to reverse it.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.651
I'll just add it
to a long list of things

05:03.825 --> 05:04.913
I have to do at Magic School.

05:05.087 --> 05:08.003
Can you tell me
if I'm alive...

05:08.177 --> 05:09.787
or dead?

05:09.961 --> 05:13.965
Uh, well the thing is, is...
we're not really sure.

05:14.139 --> 05:16.577
DEEP VOICE:
I might be able to
answer that question.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.669
And you would be?

05:21.843 --> 05:24.846
I'm the Angel of Death.

05:25.020 --> 05:25.977
[sighs]:
Oh.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.719
[lamp shatters]

05:28.893 --> 05:29.938
I knew your sister,

05:30.112 --> 05:31.766
your mother,
of course,

05:31.940 --> 05:33.202
and your grandmother.

05:33.376 --> 05:33.942
LEO:
All right, we
get the point.

05:34.116 --> 05:34.899
What do you want?

05:35.073 --> 05:35.857
Do you kill people?

05:36.031 --> 05:38.947
No, Paige, I don't kill.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.950
I merely claim the souls of
those who've already died.

05:42.124 --> 05:44.692
And you're here for who now?

05:44.866 --> 05:45.823
Oh, don't worry,

05:45.997 --> 05:47.085
not any of you.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.957
No, this time,

05:49.131 --> 05:51.176
I'm here for him.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.876
The problem is,

05:55.050 --> 05:57.357
I don't seem to be able
to claim his soul yet,

05:57.531 --> 05:59.576
even though he's dead.

05:59.750 --> 06:00.969
It's fascinating, really.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.537
I've never had
this problem before.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.060
Any ideas

06:05.234 --> 06:06.627
why... now?

06:10.065 --> 06:11.066
I cast a spell.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.502
A spell?

06:12.676 --> 06:13.982
You trapped his soul
with a spell?

06:14.156 --> 06:15.853
It wasn't intentional.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507
Reverse it, now.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.683
Hey, listen, tall dark one,

06:19.857 --> 06:21.076
if we give you him,

06:21.250 --> 06:22.991
the demon gets what he wants,

06:23.165 --> 06:25.080
and then we won't be able
to stop the demon.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.561
You don't understand.

06:29.345 --> 06:33.131
People have to die in order,
according to my list.

06:33.305 --> 06:36.439
Otherwise, the cosmic balance
is thrown off.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.093
PHOEBE:
You have to give us

06:38.267 --> 06:39.529
some time to figure out
what to do with the demon.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.096
The demon is not my concern.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.967
I'm neutral.
All I care about

06:43.141 --> 06:45.405
is maintaining the grand design.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.015
But in order to do that,

06:47.189 --> 06:49.931
I must claim the soul
of the chaplain soon.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.587
I'll be back.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.460
Okay, this is
what we're gonna do.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.507
No, weare not doing anything
until you deal with Leslie.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.943
Paige, are you crazy?

07:02.117 --> 07:03.553
There's a demon on the loose.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.163
You're right, but you're
not dealing with it,

07:05.337 --> 07:07.688
we are, because you don't
have active powers.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.951
Oh, this is ridiculous.

07:10.125 --> 07:13.433
Look, all I know is that since
you've slept with the fellow,

07:13.607 --> 07:16.610
all you've been talking about is
demons and vanquishings and...

07:16.784 --> 07:18.002
PAIGE:
And see, the thing is

07:18.176 --> 07:19.395
that Piper and I
have lives.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.788
We're not
on sabbatical.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.398
Okay, so what do you
want me to do?

07:22.572 --> 07:23.965
Talk to Leslie.

07:24.139 --> 07:26.010
Fine.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.055
I will talk to him.

07:27.229 --> 07:28.752
Paige, you figure out

07:28.926 --> 07:30.450
a way to reverse your spell.

07:30.624 --> 07:31.625
Piper, you work on

07:31.799 --> 07:32.713
the vanquishing
potion,

07:32.887 --> 07:33.975
and take care of that innocent.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.933
I'm gonna go talk to Leslie.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.587
Good luck.

07:41.112 --> 07:44.812
Okay, I think you should go let
the Elders know what's going on.

07:44.986 --> 07:45.856
[gasps]

07:46.030 --> 07:47.075
LEO:
I don't know

07:47.249 --> 07:48.119
if I can keep
facing them, Piper.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.294
Yes, you can, Leo.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.818
You did great
last time,

07:50.992 --> 07:52.689
and we really need you
to do this, please?

07:54.735 --> 07:55.692
[sighs]

08:00.741 --> 08:03.308
Oh, great!

08:03.483 --> 08:06.486
[flatline tone sounding]

08:09.184 --> 08:11.055
Call it.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.970
Time of death:
11:35 a.m.

08:13.144 --> 08:14.450
11:35 a.m.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.104
I'll make a note of it.It's your time.

08:16.278 --> 08:17.801
DOCTOR:
Get his wallet,
get his I.D.,

08:17.975 --> 08:18.889
Come.find out what happened
from the paramedics,

08:19.063 --> 08:20.412
allergies, meds...

08:20.587 --> 08:21.413
Right away,
Doctor.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
[groans quietly]

08:23.285 --> 08:24.416
NURSE:
Unhook here.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.417
I can't move.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.594
What do you mean?

08:27.768 --> 08:29.465
Your time has come.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.075
Now, free yourself.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.689
[steady beeping resumes]

08:35.863 --> 08:37.386
NURSE:
Doctor!

08:37.560 --> 08:40.520
How in the world...?

08:42.609 --> 08:44.915
Looks like we both
have a problem.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.403
How is it that
you see me, demon?

08:54.577 --> 08:55.752
Simple.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.058
With each life I take,

08:57.232 --> 09:00.409
I absorb whatever
gifts they have.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.498
You can have your gifts.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.674
I just want my souls.

09:04.848 --> 09:07.111
And I want you
to have them.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.418
That's why I'm here, to help.

09:09.592 --> 09:11.246
The witches,

09:11.420 --> 09:13.204
they've really screwed up
the natural order, haven't they?

09:13.378 --> 09:16.033
The witches stopped one death
with their spell, that's all.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.557
No, no, no, no, no.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.559
They stopped
many deaths.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.909
Just like the
one in there.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.214
Don't you see it?

09:23.388 --> 09:24.781
By messing with
the grand design,

09:24.955 --> 09:27.088
they've created a bottleneck--

09:27.262 --> 09:30.570
one where death
literally ceases.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.094
That's the only explanation.

09:33.268 --> 09:37.446
Perhaps by combining
our vast array of gifts,

09:37.620 --> 09:40.449
you can learn how to reverse
the protection spell yourself.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.408
Then we can both

09:43.583 --> 09:46.281
just move on.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.461
Oh, oh!

09:52.635 --> 09:56.900
You can do it.
You can do it.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.119
Come on.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.816
I can't do it.
I got to go.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.035
Phoebe?

10:01.209 --> 10:02.384
Where-where
have you been?

10:02.558 --> 10:03.080
I've been calling
you for days.

10:03.254 --> 10:04.342
Hey!

10:04.516 --> 10:06.736
Yeah, well,
you know, I'm just,

10:06.910 --> 10:09.086
I'm so busy, Les.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.522
You know me, busy little bee.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.698
[chuckles]

10:11.872 --> 10:12.916
W-w-wait.
Weren't you...

10:13.090 --> 10:15.092
Weren't you going in?

10:15.266 --> 10:18.574
No. Actually, I was, I was
coming, I was coming out.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.097
Okay, I'll call you.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.971
Well, no, you won't.
You're, you're avoiding me.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.234
I am not avoiding you.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.107
Okay, maybe-maybe
I'm avoiding you,

10:30.281 --> 10:33.415
but it's just, it's just
a very, very little bit.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.810
Are you sorry about

10:36.984 --> 10:39.639
what we did
upstairs? Is...

10:39.813 --> 10:43.120
No, no, I mean,
you know, it was great.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.688
I mean, of course
I'm-I'm not sorry.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.604
You know,
but I just,

10:48.778 --> 10:50.780
I don't know, I think
that maybe I feel like

10:50.954 --> 10:52.695
we don't really know each other.

10:52.869 --> 10:55.742
Look, Phoebe,
what happened was...

10:55.916 --> 10:57.744
it was great.Yeah.

10:57.918 --> 11:01.095
We-we didn't do
anything wrong.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.010
I know.

11:03.184 --> 11:06.796
I just...

11:06.970 --> 11:08.798
I don't know
if I'm ready for this.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.801
What-whatever this
could potentially be,

11:11.975 --> 11:14.848
I mean, I don't, I don't know
if I'm ready for it.

11:15.022 --> 11:17.807
Because of me
or because you're in trouble?

11:17.981 --> 11:19.940
What-what do you mean trouble?

11:20.114 --> 11:24.335
Some cop came by yesterday,
asking questions about you--

11:24.509 --> 11:26.033
FBI or something.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.556
Oh, what was his name?

11:27.730 --> 11:29.079
Uh... Brody.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.515
Agent Brody.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.085
I don't know what you
want with me, Brody.

11:35.259 --> 11:38.654
All right, clearly, you want
to say something to me.

11:38.828 --> 11:39.960
So go ahead.

11:40.134 --> 11:43.006
Pretend I'm not a Fed.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.096
No ranks.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.847
I just don't want to end up
like Inspector Sheridan, okay?

11:59.501 --> 12:01.024
Look...

12:02.852 --> 12:03.940
I got kids.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.812
Sheridan?

12:05.986 --> 12:08.684
She got transferred to
another district, that's all.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.642
I saw you shoot her
in the neck

12:10.817 --> 12:12.906
with a
tranquilizer dart.She's fine, trust me.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.211
That's just it,
I don't trust you.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.952
Yeah, well, you're
gonna have to start.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.607
Because I'm gonna need your help
to get to the Halliwells.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.565
Not this again.

12:20.740 --> 12:21.784
No.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.526
What?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.920
You don't even know
what I want with them.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.400
No.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.575
And I don't
want to know.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.490
Look, the sisters and I

12:32.664 --> 12:34.101
may not be getting
along well right now,

12:34.275 --> 12:36.451
but I sure as hell
don't wish them any harm.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.409
I'm not gonna harm them, okay?
I just need their help.

12:38.583 --> 12:39.889
With what?

12:42.196 --> 12:45.634
With something.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.942
You know, if I wanted
to harm them,

12:49.116 --> 12:51.553
I would have let Sheridan
bust them, expose them.

12:51.727 --> 12:52.902
I have been

12:53.076 --> 12:54.904
on a trail for years

12:55.078 --> 12:56.950
that has just now led me
to them.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.561
And as soon as they know that
I know that they're magical,

12:59.735 --> 13:01.693
and that I'm not a threat
to them, they're gonna have

13:01.868 --> 13:03.521
to help me--
so, unless

13:03.695 --> 13:04.914
you want to get transferred
like your buddy Sheridan,

13:05.088 --> 13:07.699
I suggest you help me.

13:17.144 --> 13:18.101
Hey.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.581
Oh! Artie.

13:19.755 --> 13:20.756
Goodness, I didn't
see you there.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.323
What are you doing here?

13:22.497 --> 13:23.803
Are you all right?
You don't look so well.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.021
Don't worry about me.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.458
Listen, there's not
a lot of time.

13:27.632 --> 13:28.633
Are you getting sick?

13:28.808 --> 13:29.983
No, I'm...

13:31.636 --> 13:33.421
...there's just so much
I want to say to you.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.075
So much I haveto say to you.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.600
I just wanted to see you.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.081
Arty, you're scaring me.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.084
Do you still have the keys
to the safety deposit box?Of course I do.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.434
Well, everything's
in there.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.871
You know, just in case
something should happen to me.

13:49.045 --> 13:51.831
You know, I kind of worry
about stuff like that.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.921
Arty, I'm...

13:56.966 --> 13:58.663
[sighs]

13:58.838 --> 13:59.926
...kind of late
for the doctor's.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.798
Oh, go, go, go,

14:02.972 --> 14:04.234
go.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.670
Are you going
to be home for dinner?

14:05.845 --> 14:09.109
Um... probably not.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.767
I love you.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.509
[chuckling]:
I love you, too.

14:34.047 --> 14:36.440
Arthur.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.878
I've been looking
all over for you.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.971
Hey.

14:45.145 --> 14:45.885
Hi, would you please tell me
you found a way

14:46.059 --> 14:47.451
to reverse the spell?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.714
No, not without losing
the chaplain, I haven't,

14:49.889 --> 14:51.020
which means
the demon...

14:51.194 --> 14:52.674
...demon will become whole,
I know.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.589
But honestly, he scares me
a hell of a lot less

14:54.763 --> 14:55.590
than the Angel of Death

14:55.764 --> 14:57.026
does right now.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.723
If I don't find the chaplain...

14:58.898 --> 15:00.073
What do you mean
"find him"? Where'd he go?

15:00.247 --> 15:02.336
He ran off and I can't find him

15:02.510 --> 15:04.555
because your spell
is protecting him.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.168
Or at least it was.

15:09.604 --> 15:10.561
You didn't lift the spell?

15:10.735 --> 15:11.954
No, I told you I didn't.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.913
Then who did?

15:25.794 --> 15:27.578
Uh, what have you done?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.841
What I should've done
in the first place.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.714
I reversed your spell
and took the chaplain's soul.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.021
And you helped a
demon in the process.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.371
On the contrary,
your demon helped me.

15:37.545 --> 15:38.676
You can't do that.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.721
You're supposed
to be neutral.

15:39.895 --> 15:43.072
Circumstances were unusual.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.945
Your spell had
unforeseen consequences.

15:46.119 --> 15:47.816
What kind of consequences?

15:47.990 --> 15:50.601
People have to die
in the order on my list.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.778
If one person doesn't,
all death ceases.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.607
Now I have to work overtime
to collect the souls

15:56.781 --> 15:58.348
I've been unable to claim,

15:58.522 --> 16:01.569
to undo the damage you've done
to the grand design.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.440
Damage?!

16:03.614 --> 16:04.789
We've done more
than almost anyone

16:04.964 --> 16:06.661
to protect your grand design.

16:06.835 --> 16:08.619
PAIGE:
Look, we should
just leave it.

16:08.793 --> 16:09.751
We still have a demon
to go after, okay?

16:09.925 --> 16:10.839
You know, we've given up a lot

16:11.013 --> 16:11.927
to make sure you have less work.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.798
I have two kids

16:13.973 --> 16:16.540
and a business, and I still
find time to fight demons, too.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.151
It's not our fault
you can't keep up.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.112
That isn't my problem.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.506
Well, it sure as hell
isn't my problem!

16:25.680 --> 16:27.116
Stop yelling at Death.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.945
I don't care; he's getting
on my last nerve.

16:30.119 --> 16:34.036
You witches created
this mess, not me.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.604
But you're going to
help me clean it up.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.868
Piper!What happened?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.218
I don't know,
she just fell.Call 911.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.095
What's going on?

16:49.269 --> 16:50.487
Oh, no.

16:50.661 --> 16:53.708
I told you... I need your help.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.927
W-What did you do to me?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.886
It's a practical matter.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.716
If you're alive, you won't be
able to help with the backlog.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.501
To take souls to
where they have to go.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.025
No.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.417
Hold it, buddy, if you...Do your job

17:07.591 --> 17:10.551
and I'll return your soul.

17:11.595 --> 17:15.556
I suggest you get going.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.688
You've a lot of catching up
to do.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.844
Well, do something.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.802
What do you want me
to do?

17:44.976 --> 17:47.457
It's easy for you to say,
dude, you're dead.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.937
PIPER:
Well, that's just crazy,
'cause I'm not supposed to be.

17:49.111 --> 17:50.678
PAIGE:
What are you yelling
at me for?

17:50.852 --> 17:51.896
It's not my issue.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.507
Excuse me, Miss?

17:53.681 --> 17:54.986
Yes.
Yes.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.774
Again, I'm...
sorry for your loss.

17:59.948 --> 18:00.905
It's okay.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.821
Could you sound a little
more upset, please?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.781
I mean, it's really...

18:06.955 --> 18:08.609
sad, you know, I feel

18:08.783 --> 18:10.437
like my sister's spirit
is around me.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.047
Of course.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.702
Now, earlier you told
the officer

18:14.876 --> 18:18.358
that you two were walking by
and your sister just fell.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.446
No warning, nothing?

18:19.620 --> 18:21.012
Mm-hmm.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.449
Yeah, no. No,

18:22.623 --> 18:23.972
no warning.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.539
And you didn't happen
to notice the body

18:25.713 --> 18:26.757
in the alley there, did you?

18:26.931 --> 18:28.411
No, I didn't.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.718
Uh, forensics is done.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.633
We're going to take the
bodies, if it's okay with you.

18:32.807 --> 18:33.503
Go ahead.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.070
[gasps]

18:35.244 --> 18:36.593
Where are they
taking me?

18:36.767 --> 18:38.682
Uh, where are you
taking her?

18:38.856 --> 18:40.510
The morgue.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.033
After the autopsy,

18:42.208 --> 18:43.165
we'll release your
sister's body to you.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.471
Oh, no, no,
they can't do that!

18:44.645 --> 18:45.559
They can't do that.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.474
Stop yelling in my ear.

18:47.648 --> 18:50.564
No, uh, no, you can't do
an autopsy because, you see...

18:51.739 --> 18:53.784
...it's against our religion.

18:53.958 --> 18:54.959
I'm sorry.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.961
This is a murder investigation.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.920
State law.

18:59.094 --> 19:00.400
If you think
of anything

19:00.574 --> 19:02.402
that might be able to help,
please...

19:02.576 --> 19:04.491
give us a call.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.580
Okay, starting to panic.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.843
Oh, no.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.061
Oh, no?
What is it?

19:10.236 --> 19:11.585
What could be
more "oh, no"

19:11.759 --> 19:15.066
than they're taking my body
away for an autopsy?

19:15.241 --> 19:16.894
Agent Brody.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.551
Yeah.What's he doing here?

19:21.725 --> 19:24.728
Mm, probably watching
me talk to myself.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.563
Paige, where have you been?
I was worried.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.957
Actually, uh, I...

19:36.131 --> 19:37.611
Did you reverse the spell?

19:37.785 --> 19:39.743
No... but someone has.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.919
Wait a minute, missy.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.138
What's going on?

19:44.139 --> 19:45.749
Where's Piper?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.577
Whoa.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.928
Whoa. How'd you do that--
what are you wearing?

19:51.102 --> 19:52.408
You didn't tell her.

19:52.582 --> 19:53.409
No.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.498
Okay, fine, Piper's dead.

19:55.672 --> 19:56.543
What?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.762
I'm not dead, I'm Death...

19:58.936 --> 20:01.069
as if my life wasn't
busy enough already.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.462
What?!

20:03.245 --> 20:06.030
Okay, long story
short, um...

20:06.205 --> 20:07.815
Death has temporarily
recruited Piper.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.383
And now,

20:10.557 --> 20:12.211
I have to collect
all the souls

20:12.385 --> 20:14.735
on this list before the coroner
starts cutting up my body.

20:14.909 --> 20:15.823
Cutting up your body?

20:15.997 --> 20:17.781
Autopsy.
[gasps]

20:20.784 --> 20:22.438
Why are these names changing?

20:22.612 --> 20:23.787
I don't know,
maybe we should call Leo.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.659
Maybe we should call Death.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.965
So does this mean the demon's
working at full force now?

20:28.139 --> 20:30.446
Well, if he is,
why hasn't he attacked?Excuse me.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.754
Can we focus on the person with
the non-dead problem over here?

20:34.842 --> 20:35.886
Let me see that list.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.932
Well... it...

20:38.106 --> 20:40.326
So Sirk was killing
his family members

20:40.500 --> 20:43.067
to become full demon,
right?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.375
So that would mean he'd have
to get rid of his human soul.

20:46.549 --> 20:47.420
Huh?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.465
Well, if he succeeded,

20:49.639 --> 20:51.337
Sirk's name would be
on the dead list, right?

20:51.511 --> 20:52.381
And it is not.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.078
Well, that would mean

20:54.253 --> 20:55.906
that he has a family member
that's alive somewhere.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.560
Right, so we just have to track
down that person before he does.

20:57.734 --> 20:58.953
Excuse me.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.912
I have souls to collect.

21:02.086 --> 21:03.610
Where did she go?

21:16.231 --> 21:18.842
[woman crying]

21:19.016 --> 21:20.061
Oh!

21:20.235 --> 21:21.323
You scared me.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.585
I scared you?

21:22.759 --> 21:24.935
Who are you
and what's happening?

21:25.109 --> 21:26.546
Well,

21:26.720 --> 21:30.767
I think you might actually be,
you know, dead.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.769
I know.

21:32.943 --> 21:35.468
Bummer, huh?

21:35.642 --> 21:37.296
Are...

21:38.514 --> 21:40.821
...you here to take me away?

21:40.995 --> 21:42.083
I don't know.

21:42.257 --> 21:43.432
I think so.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.260
See, I'm kind of
new at this.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.363
What's happening?

22:01.537 --> 22:03.104
Good question.

22:06.542 --> 22:08.501
Where does that go?

22:08.675 --> 22:09.980
I'm not sure,

22:10.154 --> 22:12.679
but I think I'm supposed
to take you in there.

22:12.853 --> 22:13.810
What do you say?

22:18.859 --> 22:20.077
If it makes you
feel any better,

22:20.251 --> 22:21.644
I'm a little
scared, too.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.608
You lied to me!

22:31.175 --> 22:34.831
I'm a seer. Hello,
I saw that coming.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.964
I did everything you said.

22:37.138 --> 22:41.011
I killed every last member
of my family and yet still,

22:41.185 --> 22:42.926
I'm part human.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.929
Oh, so just 'cause I can see
the future, it must be my fault?

22:46.103 --> 22:48.802
Give me an answer!

22:48.976 --> 22:50.194
Relax.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.588
Did you kill all
of your blood relatives?

22:52.762 --> 22:54.590
Yes.
Every

22:54.764 --> 22:56.940
last... little one?

22:57.114 --> 22:58.725
Do you want to join 'em?

22:58.899 --> 23:00.683
You know, you'd think
since your first threat failed

23:00.857 --> 23:01.858
so miserably, you'd

23:02.032 --> 23:03.643
be a little bit
nicer to me.

23:03.817 --> 23:06.646
You've obviously
missed somebody.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.692
There has to be

23:09.866 --> 23:11.607
another.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.699
[laughing]

23:16.873 --> 23:19.441
Nice.

23:19.615 --> 23:22.096
It's unclear whether the death
of local club impresario

23:22.270 --> 23:24.098
Piper Halliwell
is related to the death

23:24.272 --> 23:25.665
of the Chaplain Arthur Casey,

23:25.839 --> 23:27.101
but police insist every

23:27.275 --> 23:29.625
possibility is being
investigated.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.105
We'll have more
on this story at 11:00.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.629
This is really bad.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.718
Leo, relax-- Piper's
been dead before.

23:35.892 --> 23:37.677
Not like this, not
on the midday news.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.113
What if the
kids find out?

23:39.287 --> 23:40.462
They're at
Magic School.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.116
PAIGE:
I'm very,
very sorry too.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.423
Thanks for your condolences.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.554
Bye.

23:45.728 --> 23:46.816
Okay, I think
this is too big

23:46.990 --> 23:47.991
for even us to cover up.

23:48.165 --> 23:49.776
What about the Cleaners?No, they

23:49.950 --> 23:51.255
won't help, not after last time.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.127
If Piper suddenly
wakes up in the morgue,

23:53.301 --> 23:54.520
you have to
explain it.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.565
So what are we going to do?Well,

23:56.739 --> 23:57.827
we'll figure
something out.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.568
We always do and
in the meantime,

23:59.742 --> 24:00.787
we have to
find the demon

24:00.961 --> 24:02.310
before he kills
another relative.

24:02.484 --> 24:03.790
Okay, you know what,
I'm going to call Darryl

24:03.964 --> 24:06.009
to see if I can get him
to postpone the autopsy.

24:06.183 --> 24:08.969
I'm going to go
to Magic School and
stay with the kids.

24:11.928 --> 24:12.886
[doorbell rings]

24:13.060 --> 24:14.844
All right, now what?

24:15.932 --> 24:16.933
Leslie.

24:17.107 --> 24:18.935
Hold it!

24:20.284 --> 24:21.764
I thought you
dealt with him.

24:21.938 --> 24:23.853
No, I said I saw him; I did
not say I dealt with him.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.681
Well, you need to
get rid of him

24:25.855 --> 24:27.509
because we have a little bit
going on right now, okay?

24:27.683 --> 24:29.729
[grunts]

24:31.774 --> 24:33.515
LESLIE:
I just can't
believe it.

24:33.689 --> 24:34.908
You've got to
be in shock.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.431
Uh, yeah.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.389
You know, I am,
but...

24:38.564 --> 24:40.653
things happen, you know?

24:40.827 --> 24:43.307
I just don't understand.
I mean, was Piper even...

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
was she even sick?

24:44.657 --> 24:45.745
No, she wasn't.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.660
It was all very sudden.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.924
You sure are handling
this awfully well.

24:51.098 --> 24:53.448
Yeah, well, you know,
I'm-I'm okay.

24:53.622 --> 24:56.930
Uh, it's hard, but I'm trying
to stay strong for Paige.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.628
Oh, I-I understand.

24:59.802 --> 25:00.934
Mmm.

25:01.108 --> 25:04.459
Mmm, there's just
so much to do.

25:04.633 --> 25:05.808
Well, can I help
with anything?

25:05.982 --> 25:08.115
I don't even know
where to start.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.987
Well, it's always good to start
with people you need to, uh,

25:11.161 --> 25:13.468
to contact, l could...
I could help make a list.

25:13.642 --> 25:16.123
Wait, what did you just say?

25:16.297 --> 25:19.430
Make a list, you know, uh,
friends, family.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.606
People like that.

25:22.956 --> 25:24.740
Phoebe, um, can we talk?

25:24.914 --> 25:26.525
Yes.
Just one second.

25:26.699 --> 25:27.874
Thank you so much
for coming by.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.397
I really
appreciate it.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.485
I thought I was going
to help you make a

25:30.659 --> 25:32.095
a list and--
Yeah, I

25:32.269 --> 25:32.748
just really need to spend
some time with my sister,

25:32.922 --> 25:33.749
you know.

25:33.923 --> 25:35.446
Well, of course.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.927
Um... just call me if-if
you need anything.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.451
I will... I will,
definitely-- thanks.

25:40.626 --> 25:41.670
Okay, bye.

25:41.844 --> 25:43.977
Bye.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.589
Okay, I struck
out with Darryl.

25:47.763 --> 25:49.635
It doesn't matter, I think
I know how to find out

25:49.809 --> 25:51.071
who the demon's
going after next.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.812
How?

25:52.986 --> 25:55.554
Piper's list, the name
will be on it. Come on.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.342
SIRK:
Harriet?

26:01.516 --> 26:03.605
Do I know you?

26:03.779 --> 26:04.693
We've never met.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.696
I'm Arthur's cousin Kevin.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.655
But you can call me Sirk.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.047
[anxious gasping]

26:16.270 --> 26:17.924
Ah, so it's true.

26:18.098 --> 26:20.100
You are going to be a mother.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.623
How did you know?

26:21.797 --> 26:23.320
I have many gifts.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.671
And unfortunately for you,
I just need one more.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.983
Oh, no, you can't interfere.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.332
You're neutral.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.552
You're right.
I can't.

26:37.726 --> 26:38.814
But they can.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.605
Come on.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.519
It's okay,

26:48.694 --> 26:50.609
you're going
to be all right.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.875
So, how did you...

26:56.049 --> 26:56.876
Know?

26:57.050 --> 26:58.051
Yeah.I saw her name

26:58.225 --> 27:00.531
on the list.

27:00.706 --> 27:03.360
But it's not there any more.

27:03.534 --> 27:05.406
It will be again.

27:05.580 --> 27:08.017
One way or another.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.593
Wait, so, now you
don't want me

27:18.767 --> 27:19.768
to help you
vanquish the demon?

27:19.942 --> 27:21.030
I don't understand.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.684
Phoebe, that's
not the issue.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.120
Names come and
go off that list

27:24.294 --> 27:26.427
all the time--
Harriet's did.

27:26.601 --> 27:27.689
So what's
the big deal?

27:27.863 --> 27:29.082
The big deal
is sometimes

27:29.256 --> 27:30.605
the names don't
come off the list.

27:30.779 --> 27:31.650
Well, ours does.

27:31.824 --> 27:33.260
Not always.

27:35.697 --> 27:36.611
How's it going?

27:36.785 --> 27:37.743
She's resting.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.092
It's a lot to swallow.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.528
Your husband's dead,
magic exists

27:40.702 --> 27:42.443
and by the way,
a demon's after you.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.923
How you guys
holding up here?

27:44.097 --> 27:46.447
Fine.
Once Phoebe realizes

27:46.621 --> 27:49.450
that she's better off
here where she's safe.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.104
Oh, there they
go again.

27:51.278 --> 27:52.148
PHOEBE:
We've cheated
death before, Piper.

27:52.322 --> 27:53.672
So why can't we do it again?

27:53.846 --> 27:56.631
Because we can't this time--
I can't.

27:56.805 --> 27:57.719
Maybe you should just

27:57.893 --> 27:58.807
listen to her.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.591
Well, maybe she should focus on

28:00.766 --> 28:02.593
collecting the souls,
so her death isn't permanent.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.857
This is going nowhere.

28:05.031 --> 28:05.858
Where are you going?

28:06.032 --> 28:06.946
I'm not in the mood

28:07.120 --> 28:09.078
to lose another sister.

28:10.906 --> 28:11.733
So what's our next move?

28:11.907 --> 28:12.778
Our next move

28:12.952 --> 28:14.562
is for you to stay here,

28:14.736 --> 28:16.085
because you are on top
of the list,

28:16.259 --> 28:17.304
you have no active powers

28:17.478 --> 28:18.697
and Leo and I are
just going to go

28:18.871 --> 28:20.089
take care of the demon.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.221
Honey, you just need
to accept it.

28:37.977 --> 28:39.587
I'm not doing this any more.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.111
I give up, I quit.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.939
You can't quit, Piper.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.028
Not until you catch up.

28:47.769 --> 28:51.555
You can't make me take my
sister's soul, I won't do it.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.081
We don't get to decide
who lives or dies.

28:55.255 --> 28:59.868
Only circumstances
can change someone's fate.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.784
Well, then I won't
collect any more souls,

29:02.958 --> 29:03.785
I'll go on strike.

29:03.959 --> 29:05.961
So, to save your sister,

29:06.135 --> 29:08.007
you would threaten
to stop all death?

29:08.181 --> 29:09.138
You got it.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.400
That's rather selfish of you,

29:10.574 --> 29:11.750
don't you think?

29:11.924 --> 29:13.969
Unless, of course,
you think

29:14.143 --> 29:15.754
that death is pointless.

29:15.928 --> 29:17.843
Well, I...It's not, you know.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.845
Far from it.

29:20.019 --> 29:23.109
Life only has meaning
specifically

29:23.283 --> 29:24.937
because there is an end.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.853
Death is what forces
people to live.

29:28.027 --> 29:29.028
Yes, but...

29:29.202 --> 29:30.638
Which means that
ending death

29:30.812 --> 29:32.509
effectively ends life.

29:32.683 --> 29:35.599
Throws off the
entire cosmic design.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.080
The whole point and for what?

29:38.254 --> 29:41.562
A single fleeting life?

29:43.129 --> 29:45.479
This is bigger
than your sister, Piper.

29:45.653 --> 29:47.220
Much bigger.

29:53.617 --> 29:54.967
Nurse, I need
the records on...

29:55.141 --> 29:56.533
Oh, yes, Doctor.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.622
The sisters had
Death's list,

29:58.797 --> 30:00.494
they knew who I was
trying to kill.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.844
And you knew about the
woman's unborn child.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.542
Foreknowledge is
a bitch sometimes.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.501
But it didn't
help me.

30:07.675 --> 30:09.808
I was so close to losing
this foul human soul,

30:09.982 --> 30:13.637
but the Charmed Ones
still thwart me.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.988
Well, they are
the Charmed Ones.

30:16.162 --> 30:18.077
And they're pretty good
with the thwarting.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.906
I want to peel the flesh
from their bones

30:21.080 --> 30:22.777
while they still live.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.953
Okay, just because we're
demons doesn't mean

30:25.127 --> 30:27.434
we always have to be so... ew.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.131
Just tell me how to defeat them.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.568
And you'll stop with the gross
flesh-peely talk?

30:31.742 --> 30:33.614
Because there is

30:33.788 --> 30:36.660
an old seer's trick that might
be able to help you here.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.097
Oh, like you helped last time?

30:38.271 --> 30:39.620
Hey.

30:39.794 --> 30:42.449
Premonitions don't come
with a guarantee, okay?

30:42.623 --> 30:44.886
Do you want my help or not?

30:46.975 --> 30:50.152
See, whenever someone knows
the future, you can always

30:50.326 --> 30:52.938
get the drop on them by
knowing the future, too.

30:55.027 --> 30:58.769
So you can change it.

31:08.692 --> 31:10.477
Where's Phoebe?

31:10.651 --> 31:12.087
She's, uh, back
at Magic School.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.697
But she's still on my list.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.090
And she's next.

31:15.264 --> 31:16.091
What happened
with the Angel of Death?

31:16.265 --> 31:17.919
He's stubborn.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.486
Did you find Sirk?

31:19.660 --> 31:22.097
No, he found us--
telepathically.

31:22.271 --> 31:23.577
He wants to call a truce.

31:23.751 --> 31:25.318
It's a trap.

31:25.492 --> 31:27.537
We need to keep Phoebe
at Magic School long enough--

31:27.711 --> 31:28.582
PHOEBE:
It's too late.

31:28.756 --> 31:29.757
Phoebe.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.107
What are you doing here?

31:32.281 --> 31:34.457
Remembering what
we're all about.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.590
What we're all about
is keeping you alive.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.331
Not at the expense
of an innocent.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.768
Phoebe, this death thing
might not be very real to you,

31:40.942 --> 31:42.335
but it is very real to me.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.424
I've seen it. I am it.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.643
Piper, we've all seen it and
it's never stopped us before.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.037
That's before we knew
you were next on the list.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.648
Why are you not listening to me?
I'm trying to save you.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.824
Because this
isn't just about me.

31:53.999 --> 31:56.088
Look, I don't
want to die

31:56.262 --> 31:57.654
but I'm not going to sit around

31:57.828 --> 31:59.656
and wait for an innocent
to die either.

31:59.830 --> 32:01.397
And I think that's

32:01.571 --> 32:03.704
why I needed
to take that sabbatical.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.836
To remind myself of that.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.016
Are you finished with
the vanquishing potion?

32:11.190 --> 32:12.887
Well, yeah, but...

32:13.061 --> 32:14.367
Paige, he doesn't know we know.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.585
We're going to use this
to our advantage.

32:15.759 --> 32:17.370
When he
focuses on me,

32:17.544 --> 32:19.938
you just focus on him.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.558
Interesting.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.778
I was expecting more of a
family affair, like...

32:34.953 --> 32:36.432
perhaps your other sister.

32:36.606 --> 32:39.653
You wanted to discuss a truce--
discuss.

32:42.003 --> 32:43.962
All right.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.877
Here's the offer:

32:47.052 --> 32:49.358
You give me my cousin's wife,

32:49.532 --> 32:51.578
and I won't kill you.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.710
That's it?

32:53.884 --> 32:55.799
That's your
offer, huh?

32:55.974 --> 32:57.758
No deal. Forget it.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.108
In that case...
I guess I'll just have

33:00.282 --> 33:01.762
to kill...

33:02.981 --> 33:04.417
[grunts]

33:04.591 --> 33:05.461
...her.

33:05.635 --> 33:06.985
[gasps]

33:12.686 --> 33:14.166
Didn't see that coming, did ya?

33:18.518 --> 33:19.519
Why isn't it working?

33:19.693 --> 33:20.911
We're too late.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.609
What do you mean?

33:35.187 --> 33:36.579
What's going on?

33:36.753 --> 33:37.972
What am I in this?

33:38.146 --> 33:39.582
Piper, do something.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.020
I can't.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.813
Piper, you can't do this--
you can't take her.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.771
PIPER:
Do you think
I want to take her?

33:54.945 --> 33:56.817
I don't have a choice.What... yes, you do.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.906
Just don't take her.
Take me instead.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.909
That's not how
it works, Phoebe.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.345
I wasn't on the list.

34:03.519 --> 34:04.825
Circumstances changed.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.435
Yeah, because I changed them.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.698
It's not her fault.

34:08.872 --> 34:11.092
It's not anybody's fault.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.538
This isn't good, right?

34:24.845 --> 34:26.542
I'm so sorry, Paige.

34:26.716 --> 34:30.155
It's much easier
if you just let go.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.949
Where does that go?

34:42.123 --> 34:44.604
To where you're supposed to go.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.562
Don't be afraid.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.651
I'll be with you the whole way.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.832
Oh, God, this can't
be happening.

34:56.006 --> 34:58.574
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening.

35:01.273 --> 35:03.231
[distorted laughter, slap]

35:06.930 --> 35:08.106
[screams]

35:11.631 --> 35:13.720
I think I just had
a premonition.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.939
What? How?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.463
I don't know, I must have...

35:17.637 --> 35:19.378
earned back my powers somehow,

35:19.552 --> 35:20.944
or at least one of them.

35:25.514 --> 35:28.038
We have to save Harriet.

35:28.213 --> 35:29.518
HARRIET:
How did you get in here?

35:29.692 --> 35:31.390
She told me
it was...
Protected?

35:31.564 --> 35:33.609
Oh, it is...
from demons, not witches.

35:33.783 --> 35:35.002
That's just another little gift
I picked up

35:35.176 --> 35:36.438
when I killed
one of the sisters--

35:36.612 --> 35:37.961
Uh...

35:38.136 --> 35:40.790
Paige, I think her name was.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.705
Do say hello to her
for me, won't you?

35:49.190 --> 35:50.235
[grunts]

35:53.890 --> 35:56.110
[screams]

35:59.505 --> 36:01.246
I'm human!

36:06.120 --> 36:09.558
Interesting how our paths
keep crossing, isn't it?

36:17.827 --> 36:18.915
What happened?

36:19.089 --> 36:20.743
Come.

36:20.917 --> 36:23.529
Ah-ah-ah... not so fast.

36:23.703 --> 36:24.834
I want Paige's soul back.

36:25.922 --> 36:28.708
Sorry. You know the rules.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.623
Yeah, I do,
better than you think.

36:30.797 --> 36:32.538
Check your list. He's not on it.

36:35.845 --> 36:37.804
We changed the circumstances.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.589
First, you want to stop
a soul from moving on,

36:40.763 --> 36:42.374
and now,
you want to add one.

36:42.548 --> 36:43.505
Not add, trade.

36:43.679 --> 36:45.812
His soul for Paige's.

36:45.986 --> 36:47.857
This is unprecedented.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.946
What? No, you can't do that.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.818
Keeps your precious
cosmic balance in order,

36:51.992 --> 36:54.429
doesn't it? What have
you got to lose?

36:54.603 --> 36:56.431
You can't be
taking her seriously.

36:56.605 --> 36:57.432
Dude, you're dead.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.955
Start acting the part.

36:59.129 --> 37:02.611
This has been quite
a remarkable day.

37:03.656 --> 37:04.787
Even for me.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.442
So what do you say?

37:07.616 --> 37:08.965
Do we have a deal?

37:15.624 --> 37:16.756
Piper?

37:18.061 --> 37:19.498
I have something to tell you.

37:19.672 --> 37:21.761
Paige...

37:21.935 --> 37:23.893
You know that brown suede coat?

37:24.067 --> 37:26.896
You thought you lost it,
but, um...

37:27.070 --> 37:27.984
it's in my closet.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.682
[wry laugh]

37:29.856 --> 37:32.641
And those earrings
you liked...

37:32.815 --> 37:35.035
I borrowed them
and I never gave them back.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.473
You're stalling.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.781
I know.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.479
But you can't blame
a girl for trying.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.050
DEATH:
I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.315
Your sister...

37:54.489 --> 37:56.578
made a trade.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.542
[screams]

38:12.812 --> 38:14.727
See you.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.609
[gasping]

38:51.764 --> 38:54.462
Oh... ew.

38:57.291 --> 39:00.163
[Piper gasps]Talk about your
miracle recoveries.

39:01.251 --> 39:02.688
What are you doing here?

39:04.951 --> 39:06.909
Confirming my suspicions.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.826
Confirming that magic
really does exist,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.698
even though I don't
quite understand it yet.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.702
What do you want?

39:18.791 --> 39:20.619
I want to help you
get out of this mess.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.360
I want to tell
the local authorities

39:22.534 --> 39:23.709
that you were
working undercover for me

39:23.883 --> 39:25.101
to help solve
the Chaplain murder.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.017
I want to tell them

39:28.191 --> 39:29.758
that I asked you
to fake your own death.

39:29.932 --> 39:31.673
What's the catch?

39:32.979 --> 39:34.676
The catch is that
I'm going to need

39:34.850 --> 39:36.243
your help with something
even greater.

39:39.507 --> 39:41.030
I'll be in touch.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.143
[car approaches]

40:09.189 --> 40:10.538
Oh, forget this.

40:10.712 --> 40:12.671
[car door opens and closes]

40:20.287 --> 40:22.550
You didn't just
see all that, did you?

40:25.553 --> 40:27.425
It's okay-- it's probably
what I looked like

40:27.599 --> 40:28.948
yesterday, at the elevator.

40:29.122 --> 40:31.080
Good, so we're even?

40:31.254 --> 40:33.126
Even.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.130
So...

40:37.304 --> 40:39.567
So... let me get this straight.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.352
Your sister owns
a nightclub,

40:42.527 --> 40:45.094
but she also moonlights
as a government agent?

40:45.268 --> 40:47.575
Yeah. Kinda weird, huh?

40:49.055 --> 40:51.318
And how often
does she do that?

40:51.492 --> 40:53.538
Oh, not-not
often at all.

40:53.712 --> 40:54.800
I mean, you know,
that was

40:54.974 --> 40:56.105
just a one-time thing.

40:56.279 --> 40:58.456
Very unique situation.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.022
Well, at least
that explains

41:00.196 --> 41:02.111
why that Fed was
looking for you

41:02.285 --> 41:03.678
and why you
weren't broken up

41:03.852 --> 41:05.114
when I came
to see you.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.116
Yeah, I wanted
to tell you, but...

41:07.290 --> 41:10.380
No, look, look... I understand.

41:10.555 --> 41:12.078
And I really
appreciate you coming by

41:12.252 --> 41:14.167
to see if I was okay--
that was sweet.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.041
I care about you, Phoebe.

41:20.782 --> 41:21.870
A lot.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.046
I like you, too.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.399
I, uh... I just don't know

41:29.574 --> 41:30.836
where we go from here.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.581
Neither do I.

41:36.755 --> 41:38.452
Maybe we should

41:38.626 --> 41:40.498
just see where it takes us.

41:42.587 --> 41:44.066
I'd like that.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.600
[baby coos]

41:55.774 --> 41:57.906
You want anything?

41:58.080 --> 42:01.040
No. Just this.
