00:19.449 --> 00:25.449
Subs by Azrael from www.digitalhive.org

00:25.550 --> 00:29.850
Using the Translated subs floating
around from an automated translation
as a source for time stamps.

00:29.950 --> 00:32.542
Look at yourselves.

00:33.781 --> 00:37.253
Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.

00:38.214 --> 00:41.246
What you see is how God made you.

00:42.373 --> 00:45.969
We're not meant to experience the
world through a machine.

00:54.121 --> 00:57.445
14 years ago.

00:58.672 --> 01:01.760
What you're telling me is -
a monkey is operating this arm

01:01.875 --> 01:03.574
with nothing but his thoughts?

01:03.689 --> 01:04.938
Absolutely.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.205
There are 100 sensors,

01:10.320 --> 01:13.113
each listening to a different brain cell
or neuron.

01:16.258 --> 01:19.221
Physicaly disabed people
will be able to operate

01:19.337 --> 01:21.711
fully synthetic bodies.

01:21.827 --> 01:24.383
It provides a tremendous
amount of hope for the future.

01:24.924 --> 01:26.558
11 years ago.

01:28.813 --> 01:31.269
Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war

01:31.385 --> 01:33.293
we're going to start seeing this more and more.

01:33.408 --> 01:37.260
As manufacturing capacity
expanded for military/industrial use

01:37.564 --> 01:39.987
Surrogates became affordable
to the general public

01:40.102 --> 01:42.388
Causing a revolution in how
in how we live.

01:43.263 --> 01:46.542
The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury

01:47.016 --> 01:50.206
To have perfect looks without trips to the gym
or plastic surgery

01:50.465 --> 01:53.361
There is no question that at some
point they will be persons like anyone else

01:53.477 --> 01:56.337
They will not be human, but that they will be part
of our community?

01:56.601 --> 01:58.044
There is no question
in my mind.

01:58.314 --> 02:00.569
The decision came down 5 to 4

02:00.918 --> 02:04.310
That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.

02:08.865 --> 02:11.513
Right now, we are witnessing an
event

02:11.628 --> 02:13.700
That is of an evolutionary significance

02:13.815 --> 02:15.729
7 years ago.

02:16.495 --> 02:19.539
According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,

02:19.781 --> 02:22.136
over 98% of world population

02:22.251 --> 02:25.417
uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life

02:28.527 --> 02:33.143
We're in the midst of profound
changes that are things that were once
unimaginable have become inevitable

02:33.603 --> 02:35.803
Since the global embrace of surrogacy

02:35.992 --> 02:38.075
crime rates have dropped
to record lows

02:38.455 --> 02:41.177
We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime

02:41.547 --> 02:43.810
communicable disease and discrimination.

02:43.926 --> 02:46.516
Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries

02:46.833 --> 02:48.403
solved almost overnight.

02:48.518 --> 02:49.945
We are the creators.

02:50.179 --> 02:52.118
We will be making them

02:52.233 --> 02:53.930
Do everything for us. All in one machine.

02:54.191 --> 02:56.031
3 years ago.

02:57.030 --> 02:59.816
But there is a minority who
actively oppose Surrogates

02:59.931 --> 03:01.809
And are moving to limit their use.

03:03.931 --> 03:06.022
Many people will see this

03:06.138 --> 03:09.494
as the invasion of the inhuman.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.419
They've established reservations or
Surrogacy free zones

03:13.534 --> 03:15.601
in major cities around the country.

03:19.902 --> 03:21.444
They are led by Zaire Powell

03:21.559 --> 03:23.464
or as he is better known
to his followers

03:23.579 --> 03:24.474
The Prophet.

03:24.589 --> 03:26.894
Those machines walking around out there

03:27.009 --> 03:28.409
They're a lie.

03:32.115 --> 03:34.730
You have been sold a lie.

03:34.955 --> 03:36.695
Currently.

03:45.188 --> 03:47.180
You're going to love Tosca

03:47.296 --> 03:50.147
- Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.
- The way they all end.

03:50.262 --> 03:52.176
Everyone dies.

03:53.927 --> 03:56.812
I'm so glad you could
come back east for a visit.

03:57.065 --> 03:59.436
Well... anything for a break from exams.

04:00.185 --> 04:01.420
We're almost there.

04:01.828 --> 04:03.829
Listen... thanks for lending it to me.

04:04.281 --> 04:05.687
Have a wonderful time.

04:06.570 --> 04:07.707
I love you.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.546
I love you too Dad.

04:17.771 --> 04:19.411
You know Armando

04:19.601 --> 04:21.216
I'm not really in the mood for opera

04:22.548 --> 04:23.630
Four Point?

04:24.838 --> 04:26.208
You read my mind.

06:10.547 --> 06:12.043
Get lost meat bag

06:56.211 --> 06:57.509
I'm agent Peters.

06:58.195 --> 07:00.494
This is Agent Greer... FBI.

07:00.999 --> 07:04.471
Yeah... some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units

07:04.586 --> 07:05.988
So what do you need us for?

07:06.303 --> 07:08.829
Well I was going to file just a vandalism report

07:08.944 --> 07:10.984
but it turns out this unit's unregistered.

07:17.893 --> 07:19.822
Looks like it's going to need new optics

07:20.408 --> 07:21.517
No shit

07:34.085 --> 07:36.105
The memory chip is completely fried.

07:36.946 --> 07:38.083
Whatya got on the girl?

07:38.198 --> 07:40.355
Registered to a
Cameron McAllister.

07:41.392 --> 07:42.645
He file a report?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.476
No, that's just it, no calls, no nothin'

07:59.291 --> 08:00.508
Come on.

08:00.977 --> 08:02.898
Let's go talk to
our operator.

08:13.856 --> 08:14.785
Cam?

08:16.574 --> 08:18.098
Maybe nobody's home.

08:22.886 --> 08:24.491
My Surries in for an upgrade

08:24.606 --> 08:25.799
and they gave me this crappy loaner.

08:25.914 --> 08:26.916
Could you?

08:27.483 --> 08:28.132
Certainly.

08:36.844 --> 08:37.827
Cam?

08:39.964 --> 08:43.525
Cam's a good tenant you know, pays the
rent on time, never leaves the apartment.

08:59.009 --> 09:00.361
Cam?

09:01.930 --> 09:03.518
Cam?

09:05.168 --> 09:06.484
Oh my God!

09:08.996 --> 09:10.512
Don't touch anything, please.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.255
I'll call it in.

09:21.635 --> 09:24.205
- You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
- Yes!

09:30.708 --> 09:33.684
This is Agent Peters, we
tracked down the operator.

09:35.994 --> 09:36.662
Yeah

09:38.429 --> 09:39.700
Better send a coroner

09:44.184 --> 09:45.780
Connection interrupted.

09:47.683 --> 09:49.171
Have you ever seen anything like this?

12:38.550 --> 12:39.596
Morning

12:40.932 --> 12:41.707
Where's your....

12:42.239 --> 12:43.584
In the... charge room.

12:56.052 --> 12:57.594
You pull another all nighter?

12:58.586 --> 12:59.389
Yes I did

13:02.328 --> 13:03.888
Why don't you think about taking a break?

13:04.861 --> 13:05.953
- A break?
- Mmmmhmmm

13:06.856 --> 13:08.578
I got some vacation time saved up

13:09.056 --> 13:10.174
How about Hawaii?

13:10.806 --> 13:12.257
Lisa said she got an amazing deal

13:12.474 --> 13:13.348
Hawaii would be great

13:13.463 --> 13:17.577
She had this totally buff Surrie in Maui,
She took it surfing, parasailing, deep sea diving.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.206
You know that rental place on Boilston?

13:20.307 --> 13:23.507
I was thinking about US.
You and me going away some place together.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.821
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

13:28.903 --> 13:32.635
- We could take a drive out to the Cape?
We haven't done that for a while...
- Could talk about this another time?

13:33.385 --> 13:36.856
You now I should get to work, the
shops been really busy, everyone
wants me to look for somewhere and...

13:40.144 --> 13:42.119
Yeah... I was just thinking that...
Ummm...

13:44.166 --> 13:45.563
It just feels like we...

13:47.192 --> 13:50.682
- Haven't really spent much time together lately.
- We're together every day.

13:53.315 --> 13:55.307
Surrogates...
Not the same...

13:58.134 --> 13:59.350
It's better.

14:10.501 --> 14:14.360
College West, San Diego.

14:15.414 --> 14:16.975
Yo Canter?

14:17.271 --> 14:18.542
He's been in there all weekend.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.662
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

14:25.354 --> 14:26.427
Jesus!

14:26.824 --> 14:28.204
Someone call the cops!

14:29.538 --> 14:32.045
We are confronted by an
unprecedented situation.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.393
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.497
According to the pathologist,
their brains were liquefied in their skulls.

14:42.665 --> 14:44.730
What ever happened to
their surrogates, killed them.

14:46.741 --> 14:47.580
Sir?

14:48.031 --> 14:50.438
- How's it even possible?
- We don't know.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.720
I'm imposing a total media blackout.

14:53.993 --> 14:58.259
No one in this office is going to be responsible
for setting off a nationwide panic.

14:59.530 --> 15:03.119
The public cannot be allowed to get the idea
that using a surrogate can be fatal.

15:07.918 --> 15:10.316
Tuxedo boys last moments.

15:12.562 --> 15:14.041
Get lost meat bag.

15:17.253 --> 15:19.886
- Looks like we got ourselves a witness.
- Mmmmhmm.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.611
Hang on...

15:32.083 --> 15:34.185
- What is that?
- Exactly...

15:37.467 --> 15:39.694
- Some kind of weapon.
- Anything yet?

15:40.352 --> 15:43.896
Hang on to yourself, I think
we may actually have a homicide here.

15:44.758 --> 15:46.598
Come here and look at this.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.131
- Are you serious?
- No we don't know that for sure.

15:48.437 --> 15:51.981
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?
When was the last one?

15:52.991 --> 15:54.262
This could be huge.

15:58.299 --> 16:00.454
- Yeah, Lee go.
- We got your next of kin.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.149
I hope you're sitting down.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.694
The kids father is Lionel Canter.

16:04.992 --> 16:07.463
As in the inventor of surrogates, Lionel Canter.

16:10.215 --> 16:13.452
Jarid Canter, son of Dr.
Lionel Canter was found dead

16:13.567 --> 16:16.013
In his Southern California
dormitory this morning

16:16.129 --> 16:18.088
Cause of death
remains unknown.

16:18.203 --> 16:20.450
A college sophmore, Jarid
was the only son

16:20.565 --> 16:23.580
of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.

16:24.294 --> 16:25.889
The Former Chairman of VSI

16:26.004 --> 16:29.180
Shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.

16:29.295 --> 16:32.173
However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners

16:32.289 --> 16:34.077
Over the direction of the company

16:34.192 --> 16:36.421
Led to Canters firing
seven years ago.

16:37.034 --> 16:40.298
Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build

16:40.713 --> 16:43.499
Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.

16:45.465 --> 16:47.006
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.918
He actually lives here?

16:49.034 --> 16:49.956
I didn't say that.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.343
You'll be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

16:55.552 --> 16:57.230
I work for Dr. Canter.

16:58.366 --> 16:59.991
His private elevator is this way.

17:15.194 --> 17:17.286
Please, wait in here.

17:20.941 --> 17:22.249
What a nice place.

17:22.988 --> 17:24.186
It should be.

17:25.323 --> 17:27.623
It's a piece of every surrogate they sell.

17:35.356 --> 17:36.258
Dr. Canter?

17:36.700 --> 17:37.520
That's right.

17:37.935 --> 17:39.197
You're with the FBI?

17:39.991 --> 17:40.892
Yes we are.

17:41.574 --> 17:42.414
This way.

17:43.405 --> 17:45.713
I can't help but notice the similarities between

17:45.828 --> 17:48.716
your surrogate... and the
one your son Jared was using.

17:49.577 --> 17:52.119
I never really knew
Jarid as a child.

17:53.512 --> 17:56.425
He grew up with his mother in California
Who kept him from me.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.491
When he went to college I encourage him
to borrow my surrogates whenever he wanted.

18:00.607 --> 18:02.096
How did you managed to do that?

18:02.379 --> 18:04.588
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

18:04.966 --> 18:07.302
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.284
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.828
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

18:18.323 --> 18:21.489
No offense Dr. Canter.
We're just trying to straighten out our facts.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.206
What is this?

18:24.035 --> 18:26.082
- Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
- No sir.

18:26.197 --> 18:27.435
- You tryin' to handle me?
- No sir.

18:27.624 --> 18:29.076
Because I'm not going to be handled.

18:29.337 --> 18:30.365
Dr Canter...

18:30.879 --> 18:32.998
- I know how you must feel.
- Do you?

18:33.773 --> 18:34.828
Yes, sir.

18:35.892 --> 18:37.524
I lost a son myself.

18:48.423 --> 18:51.172
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

18:57.194 --> 18:57.915
No.

18:58.853 --> 18:59.755
Or yourself?

19:05.225 --> 19:06.371
Oh my God.

19:07.894 --> 19:09.545
If it was me they were after...

19:11.017 --> 19:13.180
I'm responsible for my sons death.

19:20.966 --> 19:23.788
Well... I guess the interview's over.

19:42.656 --> 19:43.567
No!

19:46.561 --> 19:50.357
<i>Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines</i>

19:50.472 --> 19:52.930
<i>With the grace and beauty
of the human form</i>

19:53.210 --> 19:54.842
<i>To make your life safer</i>

19:55.040 --> 19:55.960
<i>And better.</i>

19:56.161 --> 19:58.361
<i>Whether you're....</i>

19:59.445 --> 20:02.952
<i>Get ready to live your life without any
risk or danger.</i>

20:03.532 --> 20:05.958
<i>You can live your life
without limitations.</i>

20:06.905 --> 20:09.312
<i>And become anyone you want to be.</i>

20:09.428 --> 20:11.973
<i>From the comfort and
safety of your own home.</i>

20:12.240 --> 20:14.621
<i>VSI, where it all began.</i>

20:15.369 --> 20:17.993
<i>Do what you want.
Be what you want.</i>

20:19.481 --> 20:21.392
Agents Greer and Peters?
I'm Victor Welsh.

20:21.812 --> 20:23.273
VP of corporate relations.

20:23.913 --> 20:25.031
Please Sit.

20:25.374 --> 20:28.241
- Thanks for taking the time to see us.
- No problem.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.336
You uh... You must know Andy Stone?

20:31.562 --> 20:32.878
Our immediate superior.

20:32.993 --> 20:34.393
Do give him my regards.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.630
- We're from the legal department.
- Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

20:37.839 --> 20:38.588
Not at all.

20:38.703 --> 20:42.122
The two of you might be interested
in a free software upgrade we're
offering all law enforcement officials.

20:42.618 --> 20:45.793
Better night vision.
Improved pursuit capability.

20:46.795 --> 20:50.113
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

20:53.576 --> 20:56.281
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.905
What do the operators say?

20:58.248 --> 20:59.249
Not much.

20:59.871 --> 21:00.781
They're dead.

21:00.897 --> 21:04.821
If you're trying to imply a link between VSI
products and an operators accidental death...

21:04.937 --> 21:06.147
I'm not implying anything.

21:07.230 --> 21:10.576
I just want to know how an operator
can be killed by signals from it's surrogate.

21:10.691 --> 21:12.217
This idea itself is absurd.

21:12.332 --> 21:15.364
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

21:15.803 --> 21:18.454
Surries have jumped from bridges...
Been shot....

21:18.842 --> 21:21.330
Even... blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

21:22.043 --> 21:23.719
The failsafes always kick in.

21:23.957 --> 21:27.635
I can assure you VSI's products have the most
stringent safety standards in the industry.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.493
What about a human head?

21:30.476 --> 21:31.964
What would cause one of them to blow up?

21:32.576 --> 21:33.506
Agent Greer...

21:34.120 --> 21:34.814
We're not doctors.

21:35.806 --> 21:36.599
Honey...

21:36.942 --> 21:38.357
I don't know WHAT you are.

21:39.250 --> 21:43.597
I mean for all I know you could be
some big fat dude sitting in a stim
chair with his dick hanging out.

22:02.202 --> 22:03.915
Interesting technique.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.109
I hate lawyers.

22:12.142 --> 22:13.287
What are you doing?

22:28.259 --> 22:29.504
Mr. Steinberg?

22:30.811 --> 22:32.452
Seth Steinberg?

22:35.902 --> 22:36.750
Hello.

22:36.939 --> 22:37.878
Sorry.

22:38.075 --> 22:39.104
I was in the can.

22:39.219 --> 22:41.403
Agent Peters, I'm Agent Greer with the FBI.

22:42.052 --> 22:42.890
Really?

22:46.138 --> 22:47.915
You know with any chip this damaged...

22:48.311 --> 22:50.412
Every circuit must have fired off at once.

22:50.746 --> 22:51.791
Kablooey!

22:52.369 --> 22:54.281
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

22:54.548 --> 22:58.299
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

22:58.759 --> 23:01.275
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

23:01.545 --> 23:03.078
Mind if we take a look at them?

23:17.450 --> 23:18.758
Here we go.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.303
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

23:33.072 --> 23:35.398
No scratches.
No dirt. No mud.

23:35.786 --> 23:37.797
Mind if I check out the identity chip?

23:38.689 --> 23:40.240
- Heh. Yeah.
- Why not?

23:40.700 --> 23:41.611
Didn't come back with one.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.488
I'm down!

24:02.764 --> 24:03.567
I'm down.

24:03.982 --> 24:06.786
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

24:06.901 --> 24:07.751
Yes sir!

24:09.239 --> 24:10.474
Back online.

24:24.548 --> 24:25.639
Follow me.

24:26.624 --> 24:28.650
- Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
- Go kick some ass sir!

24:28.930 --> 24:31.365
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

24:32.061 --> 24:35.794
Why on earth would the Defense
Department want to develop a weapon
that could wipe out our own troops?

24:36.561 --> 24:38.392
So no such weapon exists...

24:38.507 --> 24:40.411
If it did, I'd know about it.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.461
And the soldier that we saw?

24:42.576 --> 24:45.571
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

24:47.257 --> 24:48.313
Now if you'll excuse me.

24:48.701 --> 24:50.341
I've got to move a Peace Keeping operation.

24:57.169 --> 24:59.053
- Check your screen
- What?

24:59.168 --> 25:00.217
Myles Strickland.

25:00.332 --> 25:00.965
Who?

25:01.080 --> 25:03.111
Myles Strickland, beat that!

25:03.598 --> 25:06.709
I did a run on criminal records

25:06.824 --> 25:07.899
Guess what I found?

25:08.015 --> 25:09.783
He's already in the system.

25:10.036 --> 25:13.021
He was arrested a month ago
for multiple counts of armed robbery.

25:13.715 --> 25:15.329
And what's really weird about this...

25:15.924 --> 25:18.313
After he was busted...
They let him off.

25:18.881 --> 25:20.694
Someone on the inside's protecting him.

25:20.955 --> 25:22.885
But I put out an APB anyway.

25:37.825 --> 25:39.511
Visual matching.

25:51.301 --> 25:54.078
- Cameras caught your guy.
- Where?

25:54.193 --> 25:56.134
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

25:56.249 --> 25:57.885
Not far from the reservation.

25:58.076 --> 26:00.140
Boston PD is on its way.

26:00.654 --> 26:02.205
Stay here.
Keep tabs on him.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.838
Wait a minute where are you going?

26:04.027 --> 26:05.434
Dorchester.

26:06.465 --> 26:07.944
It wasn't too difficult.

26:08.059 --> 26:10.910
I put his face in the system and... Bingo!
We found him in an alley.

26:11.641 --> 26:13.823
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

26:14.057 --> 26:15.265
Thanks Jerry.

26:16.589 --> 26:18.139
He's one of our best watchers.

26:18.492 --> 26:19.718
He's semi-retired.

26:20.070 --> 26:22.126
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.803
- Pretty sweet huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice setup you have here.

26:25.128 --> 26:27.319
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

26:28.234 --> 26:29.569
Touch a button.

26:29.911 --> 26:31.724
I can tap into anyone's feed.

26:32.312 --> 26:34.296
It's kinda like being inside Gods head.

26:35.964 --> 26:38.038
Ooooooh Boy... I felt that one coming.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.274
My name's Saunders by the way.

26:42.062 --> 26:43.325
Jennifer Peters.

26:43.838 --> 26:46.174
Yeah... Yeah you are aren't you?

26:47.422 --> 26:48.730
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmmm?

26:49.803 --> 26:50.930
Why no surrogate?

26:51.300 --> 26:52.237
Me?

26:53.148 --> 26:54.844
They've been trying to puppet me for years.

26:55.862 --> 26:58.044
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

26:58.692 --> 27:00.198
Excuse me a second...

27:02.146 --> 27:03.849
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

27:03.965 --> 27:05.977
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

27:06.404 --> 27:08.658
Charlie 4639er.

27:08.892 --> 27:11.030
Sierra 7855

27:11.399 --> 27:14.672
Let's see if they have a
security camera in the hotel...

27:16.485 --> 27:17.685
Looks like there is one.

27:20.047 --> 27:21.508
Warrant recieved.

27:22.112 --> 27:23.284
Agent Peters...

27:23.780 --> 27:24.916
Watch this.

27:25.617 --> 27:26.217
Boom.

27:26.618 --> 27:27.618
Boom.

27:28.782 --> 27:30.693
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

27:31.054 --> 27:33.480
It's brand new software.
I call it buffering.

27:33.595 --> 27:35.472
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

27:35.588 --> 27:37.256
Well that can't be legal?

27:37.371 --> 27:38.807
Ahhh... It's a grey area.

27:38.922 --> 27:40.719
They don't ask, we don't tell.

27:42.017 --> 27:42.900
It's pretty cool huh?

27:43.279 --> 27:44.379
Awww C'mon.

27:45.213 --> 27:47.187
Relax, we're the
good guys.

28:00.343 --> 28:06.052
Suspect on a bike heading east of
South Hampton up a mile from the Res'

28:06.167 --> 28:10.118
Greer, be careful, you're heading
straight towards Dread territory. We
don't have jurisdiction to fly over there.

28:10.233 --> 28:11.483
It's restricted air space.

28:12.448 --> 28:13.782
Greer are you there?

29:11.910 --> 29:12.820
Freeze!

29:19.042 --> 29:20.566
What was that?

29:24.656 --> 29:26.125
Agghhh!!!

30:59.304 --> 31:01.054
Fire! Fire!

32:50.338 --> 32:52.656
I ain't done nothin'!
I ain't done nothin'!

32:54.547 --> 32:55.835
Give me the bag.

32:57.675 --> 32:58.748
Throw it over here.

33:00.362 --> 33:01.995
Throw it over here.
Now!

33:29.408 --> 33:30.796
You're an abomination.

33:31.544 --> 33:32.645
Oh god.

33:58.284 --> 34:00.097
Maggie.

34:01.450 --> 34:02.766
Maggie!

34:04.852 --> 34:07.341
Lionel Canter is on the phone.
He's called for Greer a half dozen times.

34:07.456 --> 34:08.937
I can't deal with this right now.

34:09.052 --> 34:11.408
- He's pretty upset.
- Just tell him someone will call him back.

34:11.523 --> 34:12.165
Peters!

34:12.770 --> 34:14.583
You gotta believe me
I tried to stop him.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.676
Well you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

34:16.791 --> 34:17.639
Clock out.

34:48.510 --> 34:50.259
Oh you're kidding!

34:56.274 --> 34:57.248
God.

34:58.919 --> 34:59.569
Tom?

35:01.697 --> 35:02.571
Oh my God!

35:02.779 --> 35:04.069
Call an ambulance!

35:19.450 --> 35:20.902
Myles Strickland is it?

35:22.660 --> 35:24.040
Why are you...

35:31.551 --> 35:32.750
What's goin' on?

35:32.865 --> 35:33.805
Who was it?

35:34.391 --> 35:35.770
Who gave you the weapon?

35:36.374 --> 35:37.691
And paid you to use it?

35:39.099 --> 35:40.100
I don't know!

35:40.215 --> 35:41.786
Myles you can't lie to me.

35:42.264 --> 35:43.292
I'm not lyin'.

35:43.407 --> 35:45.032
I swear to God sir, I'm not lying.

35:45.747 --> 35:47.099
He never told me his name.

35:47.214 --> 35:48.993
We talked on disposable cell phones.

35:49.108 --> 35:50.463
I never saw
his face.

35:50.959 --> 35:53.502
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

35:57.318 --> 35:59.148
A Police chase through Dorchester concluded

35:59.263 --> 36:01.961
with an FBI helicopter crash landing

36:02.178 --> 36:04.261
inside Bostons' Dread Reservation

36:04.376 --> 36:06.768
Residents of the Reservation are outraged

36:06.884 --> 36:08.400
over what they're calling

36:08.515 --> 36:11.808
a gross violation of their territorial sovereignity.

36:11.923 --> 36:13.999
Human Coalition Leader, The Prophet

36:14.229 --> 36:17.538
responded in a statement made earlier today.

36:17.863 --> 36:19.306
They've attacked us.

36:19.594 --> 36:23.111
Declared War on our way of
life and left us with one option:

36:23.584 --> 36:24.639
Revolution!

36:24.910 --> 36:28.463
We did not throw the first stone.
But we will throw the last.

36:35.221 --> 36:36.133
Hi.

36:38.053 --> 36:38.838
Hey.

36:40.623 --> 36:41.714
How's the headache?

36:42.400 --> 36:43.616
Still there.

36:45.806 --> 36:47.844
- Thanks for being here.
- Of course.

36:48.294 --> 36:50.188
<i>Imagine a World where
children are always safe.</i>

36:50.909 --> 36:52.488
<i>a world where every child</i>

36:52.603 --> 36:54.651
<i>and every parent is secure.</i>

36:55.298 --> 36:57.633
<i>Make every childhood a happy one.</i>

36:58.616 --> 37:00.194
<i>Surrogates for kids.</i>

37:00.456 --> 37:04.166
<i>Exclusively from VSI.
Where it all Beg...</i>

37:09.273 --> 37:11.569
- Knock Knock. Hey.
- Andy. Hi.

37:12.119 --> 37:13.156
Oh my gosh.

37:13.659 --> 37:15.526
- I haven't seen you forever.
- I know.

37:15.641 --> 37:17.122
I should let you guys talk.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.475
- Will you be okay?
- Mmmhmm

37:21.017 --> 37:22.180
See you tomorrow morning.

37:23.117 --> 37:24.000
Bye.

37:24.323 --> 37:25.053
Bye.

37:30.437 --> 37:31.493
How bad?

37:31.898 --> 37:33.990
The doctor said you're
lucky to be alive.

37:34.472 --> 37:35.951
Good thing you unplugged.

37:37.628 --> 37:39.116
You gotta go get him.

37:39.539 --> 37:41.082
Stricklands got that weapon.

37:41.571 --> 37:42.779
You just get a court order...

37:42.895 --> 37:45.458
There won't be any court
orders, you've been suspended.

37:45.963 --> 37:46.702
For what?

37:46.817 --> 37:50.029
- Tom, you violated our treaty with the Dreads.
- Forget the Treaty!

37:50.321 --> 37:51.439
He killed 5 cops!

37:51.555 --> 37:54.297
Look... I'm gonna take care
of this case myself personally. Alright?

37:55.163 --> 37:59.473
Now... I'm afraid the bureau won't
be able to supply you with a new
surrogate until after the official inquiry.

38:00.340 --> 38:02.070
Same goes for your
gun and your badge.

38:02.819 --> 38:04.288
Don't think about this now.

38:10.767 --> 38:12.624
He killed 5 cops Andy.

38:16.348 --> 38:18.079
Take some time to heal.

38:49.634 --> 38:50.329
Hey.

38:51.077 --> 38:52.741
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

38:52.842 --> 38:53.742
That's ok.

38:56.188 --> 38:57.829
Wow... You look a lot
like your synth.

38:58.406 --> 38:59.100
Yeah

38:59.921 --> 39:00.796
Should we go?

39:07.306 --> 39:09.858
How long has it been since you've
been out without a Surrie?

39:10.723 --> 39:12.130
I can't even remember.

39:16.379 --> 39:18.733
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the axiety.

39:33.453 --> 39:34.202
Greer?

39:35.077 --> 39:36.483
- Look... This isn't gonna work.
- I'm fine.

39:37.238 --> 39:38.491
I have an idea.

40:01.518 --> 40:02.916
Come on... This is
a really bad idea...

40:03.123 --> 40:05.288
It's gonna be alright. I'm sure
we'll find you something decent.

40:13.634 --> 40:16.132
Now we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

40:18.330 --> 40:19.583
Sync looks good.

40:19.844 --> 40:21.287
It's responding well to signal, right?

40:23.244 --> 40:24.353
It feels numb.

40:24.650 --> 40:25.922
It's only a base model.

40:26.300 --> 40:27.455
It comes with vision and hearing.

40:27.570 --> 40:29.494
If you want other senses
they're extra.

40:29.738 --> 40:33.029
Of course if you like seeing your own
face when you look in the mirror, no problem.

40:33.498 --> 40:35.734
I'll just scan your head, cast the thermo plastic

40:35.850 --> 40:37.411
and you're good to go
in less than an hour.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.293
Hey no charge on the improvements.

40:39.870 --> 40:41.684
I'm sure you wouldn't mind taking yourself back

40:41.799 --> 40:44.100
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that?

40:44.902 --> 40:46.219
- Hmmm?
- I think we're done here.

40:52.080 --> 40:52.847
Greer.

40:59.662 --> 41:00.582
Tom.

41:01.383 --> 41:02.183
Tom.

41:02.864 --> 41:05.488
Tom you can't come out
here by yourself. It's not safe.

41:05.603 --> 41:07.273
- I'm fine.
- Let me take you home.

41:07.388 --> 41:09.108
I'm not going home.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.760
Tom. We gotta forget the case.

41:12.111 --> 41:14.230
Stone is going to run things his way

41:14.346 --> 41:16.683
and as far as we're concerned, it's over.

41:16.798 --> 41:19.659
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.961
Then you gotta let me help you.

41:25.576 --> 41:27.670
I'm not gonna let you win.

41:27.785 --> 41:29.238
Take care of yourself Peters.

42:15.892 --> 42:18.624
Death came to Myles Strickland

42:19.932 --> 42:22.574
As death comes to all men.

42:23.566 --> 42:24.765
But for Myles

42:25.847 --> 42:27.307
It's not an ending.

42:28.777 --> 42:30.481
It's a new beginning.

42:32.113 --> 42:35.666
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires

42:37.498 --> 42:38.940
for a greater cause, a greater good.

42:40.483 --> 42:41.890
You never die.

42:43.071 --> 42:44.649
You never disappear.

42:45.701 --> 42:48.226
That is what it means to be human.

42:49.723 --> 42:51.354
There is no alternative

42:51.851 --> 42:54.682
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet

42:55.282 --> 42:56.942
Through a machine.

42:57.572 --> 43:01.514
But deep down inside, you
know you're living a lie

43:03.632 --> 43:05.823
Here, inside these walls

43:06.019 --> 43:07.823
We understand the truth.

43:14.011 --> 43:17.573
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences

43:17.688 --> 43:19.746
to feel truly connected.

43:20.864 --> 43:22.271
Not with machines

43:24.657 --> 43:25.766
But with ourselves.

43:30.761 --> 43:32.628
This is the human condition.

43:32.905 --> 43:35.006
This is what gives life meaning.

43:35.917 --> 43:36.864
My friends.

43:37.288 --> 43:40.786
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

43:41.463 --> 43:43.320
That day, I promise you

43:43.974 --> 43:45.173
Is close at hand.

43:45.804 --> 43:48.653
The day... we get a second chance.

44:17.594 --> 44:18.641
Excuse me.

44:20.435 --> 44:21.760
- Can I help you?
- Yeah

44:22.004 --> 44:23.861
I'd like to speak to
The Prohet for a minute.

44:24.113 --> 44:25.510
You and everybody else bud, no.

44:25.826 --> 44:27.413
You some kind of cop or somethin'?

44:27.873 --> 44:29.361
You have no jurisdiction here.

44:29.476 --> 44:31.345
Can I talk to you
about Myles Strickland please?

44:36.386 --> 44:37.341
Enough.

44:40.768 --> 44:43.185
It's different when you actually feel the pain.

44:43.842 --> 44:44.663
Isn't it?

44:46.782 --> 44:48.378
What happened to Strickland?

44:50.399 --> 44:51.913
Was he a friend of yours?

44:52.409 --> 44:53.455
He had a weapon.

44:53.879 --> 44:55.519
A very dangerous weapon.

44:56.881 --> 44:59.288
My people will do
anything to get this back.

45:01.988 --> 45:06.324
Well... if I happen to come
across such a weapon

45:07.541 --> 45:10.192
I promise to have it
delivered to your door.

45:11.825 --> 45:13.529
Show him to the gates.

45:15.225 --> 45:16.279
Gently.

45:57.987 --> 45:59.019
Agent Greer.

45:59.587 --> 46:01.319
May I offer you a ride?

46:04.752 --> 46:06.537
You'll have to excuse my appearance.

46:06.888 --> 46:09.377
It's not safe for me to
use my usual surrogates.

46:10.838 --> 46:11.748
Dr. Canter.

46:11.864 --> 46:13.642
This is one of VSI's newer models.

46:14.643 --> 46:15.978
How long have you been following me?

46:16.093 --> 46:19.458
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my sons murder.

46:22.644 --> 46:24.294
You lost a child Agent Greer?

46:25.818 --> 46:26.548
How?

46:29.984 --> 46:31.426
Car accident.

46:36.354 --> 46:37.823
It was just an accident.

46:39.473 --> 46:40.447
I'm sorry.

46:45.205 --> 46:48.731
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

46:53.006 --> 46:54.350
All I can tell you

46:55.793 --> 46:57.569
is that the man who killed your son is dead.

46:58.281 --> 46:59.760
His name was Myles Strickland.

47:00.483 --> 47:01.944
Lived on the Res'.

47:03.874 --> 47:05.343
He was killed by his own people.

47:05.902 --> 47:06.886
And that's it?

47:07.373 --> 47:08.391
Case solved?

47:09.533 --> 47:11.688
One man didn't act on his own.

47:12.906 --> 47:14.358
Whatever killed my son

47:14.473 --> 47:17.441
was an extraordinary
sophisticated technology.

47:17.730 --> 47:20.110
Far beyond the capabilites of the Dreads.

47:20.707 --> 47:23.429
We're talking about a
billion dollar weapons project.

47:24.268 --> 47:26.468
Who do you know spends money like that?

47:36.153 --> 47:38.849
Focus on the weapon, where it came from.

47:55.496 --> 47:56.759
Mmmm do me.

48:02.608 --> 48:04.439
How was it?

48:14.281 --> 48:16.662
- Hey Maggie?
- No, thank you.

48:17.086 --> 48:18.800
Come on... it'll take the edge off.

48:27.719 --> 48:29.459
Tom?
Honey?

48:33.691 --> 48:35.287
I thought you were still in the hospital?

48:35.647 --> 48:36.324
Yeah...

48:37.379 --> 48:38.497
I can see that.

48:38.741 --> 48:39.922
What happened?

48:41.704 --> 48:45.049
Tom I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

48:45.144 --> 48:48.376
- Tom?
- You look very nice, Sexy.

48:48.492 --> 48:50.784
Ok... Don't start.
I'm sorry, those guys...

48:50.982 --> 48:54.062
They're friends of Brigettes, she brought
them over, she wanted to go to this party...

48:54.261 --> 48:55.390
I didn't even want to go.

48:55.506 --> 48:57.113
How long have you been jacking?

48:57.228 --> 48:58.393
I don't.

48:59.973 --> 49:01.244
I don't do it Tom.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.391
And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

49:04.157 --> 49:05.492
Okay go have a good time.

49:40.876 --> 49:42.274
Tom stop it!

50:03.299 --> 50:04.246
Tom?

50:05.210 --> 50:06.518
Tom, what was that?

50:08.315 --> 50:10.199
- What?
- What you want from me?

50:17.151 --> 50:18.269
I want you...

50:19.663 --> 50:20.934
...My wife.

50:22.494 --> 50:23.930
I am your wife.

50:24.099 --> 50:25.433
And you won't see it.

50:26.055 --> 50:27.002
No. God.

50:28.247 --> 50:29.085
No you're not.

50:31.809 --> 50:34.675
Not...
Not... this.

50:35.315 --> 50:37.756
Not this... thing...
This...

50:41.988 --> 50:43.159
I just want you.

50:44.959 --> 50:47.124
And I want the woman that's in that room.

50:47.340 --> 50:48.440
My wife.

50:52.536 --> 50:54.188
Things have changed Tom.

50:54.303 --> 50:56.359
You're... No you've changed.
You're just scared.

50:56.474 --> 50:58.487
You're just scared...
We could go talk to somebody...

50:59.561 --> 51:02.412
Maggie...
Maggie your my wife.

52:00.694 --> 52:03.282
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

52:03.742 --> 52:04.445
Yeah.

52:05.248 --> 52:08.512
- You look... You look terrible.
- Thanks you too.

52:50.956 --> 52:53.897
The chips completely fried.
What do you got on the girl?

52:54.267 --> 52:56.196
Come on...
Let's go talk to her Op.

52:57.642 --> 52:59.634
We can we access any Surrie in the grid.

53:00.364 --> 53:03.069
Touch of a Button, I can
tap into anyones feed.

53:20.040 --> 53:22.456
Transfer to remote operator.

53:40.792 --> 53:41.793
I wish I could help.

53:42.189 --> 53:43.587
This thing killed 5 cops.

53:43.984 --> 53:46.482
One of my men.
Almost put me in the ground.

53:47.016 --> 53:49.994
I know it's a weapon.
I want to know what kind.

53:50.046 --> 53:53.138
- You're asking me to compromise highly
classified information...
- I know where it is.

53:53.905 --> 53:54.807
Where is it?

53:55.843 --> 53:56.529
Right...

54:04.155 --> 54:05.508
Is called an O.D.

54:06.229 --> 54:07.735
Overload Device.

54:09.298 --> 54:12.030
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

54:13.230 --> 54:15.555
Giving the software virus straight to the CPU.

54:15.908 --> 54:17.846
Disables the Surries instantly.

54:18.381 --> 54:21.419
We didn't know the virus would
defeat the built in failsafes.

54:22.754 --> 54:23.980
...kill the operators.

54:24.287 --> 54:25.523
Who makes it?

54:27.362 --> 54:28.417
VSI.

54:30.426 --> 54:31.517
After the test

54:33.167 --> 54:34.636
the project was scrapped.

54:35.619 --> 54:37.062
Every unit was destroyed.

54:37.525 --> 54:38.905
Except this one right?

54:41.655 --> 54:42.592
Where is it?

54:43.503 --> 54:45.406
Right now it's in the hands
of the Human Coalition.

54:45.521 --> 54:47.137
- How long have they had it?
- A day...

54:47.252 --> 54:48.499
Maybe two.

54:50.050 --> 54:51.484
This is out of your hands.

54:51.997 --> 54:53.620
Military will handle this.

55:01.021 --> 55:03.059
- You called for us?
- Take this to

55:03.320 --> 55:05.214
the federal building downtown.

55:06.224 --> 55:07.622
A woman will meet you there.

55:08.210 --> 55:10.149
Agent Jennifer Peters.

55:10.690 --> 55:13.539
You're to give it to her... and her alone.

55:21.384 --> 55:22.222
Peters.

55:23.233 --> 55:24.270
What are you doing?

55:24.936 --> 55:26.848
Just a background check on VSI.

55:27.443 --> 55:28.625
Structural stuff.

55:28.740 --> 55:30.774
Those are internal financial records.

55:31.261 --> 55:32.776
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

55:33.542 --> 55:34.399
6th Floor.

55:39.397 --> 55:40.903
Don't forget the cheek bones.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.853
Okay, honey.
Face off.

55:56.699 --> 55:57.646
Maggs.

56:04.849 --> 56:05.876
Hiya Tom.

56:08.423 --> 56:11.083
Those ugh... Smile muscles need to set.

56:14.077 --> 56:15.690
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:17.097 --> 56:18.496
I'm sorry about last night.

56:19.456 --> 56:20.439
I'm at work Tom.

56:20.700 --> 56:22.720
- I didn't come here to argue.
- Good.

56:27.075 --> 56:29.213
See I feel like I've gone crazy.

56:32.926 --> 56:34.278
It's...
I just...

56:36.000 --> 56:37.317
I love you.

56:38.338 --> 56:41.017
I love this smart, beautiful

56:41.774 --> 56:43.541
Intelligent, funny

56:44.795 --> 56:45.840
Woman... And...

56:48.022 --> 56:49.294
I can't sleep.

56:50.619 --> 56:53.171
And when I do... I have these dreams that are...

56:58.737 --> 57:00.703
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

57:01.753 --> 57:03.499
Tom... don't...

57:04.031 --> 57:05.573
Don't you ever think about him?

57:06.321 --> 57:07.999
Of course I think about him Tom.

57:08.191 --> 57:09.651
You say you don't sleep?

57:09.767 --> 57:11.130
You say you have nightmares?

57:11.245 --> 57:14.485
That girl who you say
is funny and charming and whitty...

57:14.881 --> 57:17.145
And has a great smile...
she doesn't smile anymore.

57:17.948 --> 57:19.020
I don't believe that.

57:19.263 --> 57:21.706
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

57:21.821 --> 57:23.555
Is because THIS is who I am now.

57:23.772 --> 57:25.214
- That's okay, honey.
- No, no.

57:25.611 --> 57:27.180
- No.
- Maggie.
- NO!

57:27.669 --> 57:28.958
Maggie wait.

58:25.711 --> 58:28.750
Brothers and sisters gather
close and prepare yourselves.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.707
The day of the resurrection is upon us.

58:31.822 --> 58:35.513
The day we make history.
The day we launch the revolution!

58:42.271 --> 58:44.047
We all know what we're looking for.

58:44.162 --> 58:47.167
Remember... Do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

58:49.403 --> 58:50.972
Biologicals here.

58:58.013 --> 58:59.113
Over there!

59:07.387 --> 59:11.855
- Cease fire!
- Hands on your head.
- Cease fire.

59:21.709 --> 59:22.754
My God.

59:46.584 --> 59:49.469
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

59:49.866 --> 59:51.733
So I started going
through the payroll records.

59:53.002 --> 59:54.292
You won't believe this.

59:54.407 --> 59:56.745
- For the last 16 months...
- He was working for us.

59:57.168 --> 59:57.980
That's right.

59:58.935 --> 01:00:00.640
Which means Stones
gotta be dirty.

01:00:01.201 --> 01:00:03.862
Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.340
Hey Tom.
I thought you were on leave?

01:00:12.719 --> 01:00:13.738
Oh yeah... I am.

01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:16.750
Actually I was just suspended.

01:00:17.176 --> 01:00:19.584
Another investigation,
I'll just clear my desk out.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:21.098
You should be home.

01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:22.731
Recuperating Ok?

01:00:22.955 --> 01:00:24.759
Not walking around here in the flesh...

01:00:25.194 --> 01:00:27.782
I was at home then I came
here to clean out my desk.

01:00:27.897 --> 01:00:30.415
And you know... before the
medication kicks in... Hopefully...

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:34.514
I can find a box...
And... Oh...

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.902
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

01:00:38.988 --> 01:00:39.791
I'm sorry?

01:00:39.906 --> 01:00:42.180
Victor Welsh, VSI, the good looking kid?

01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:45.408
Very excited you coming over there, finally
moving into the private sector

01:00:45.524 --> 01:00:46.652
You must be excited.

01:00:47.095 --> 01:00:49.385
Why don't you come into my
office, you're not looking too sharp.

01:00:50.268 --> 01:00:51.522
Yeah Yeah... I got a minute.

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:55.688
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

01:00:56.265 --> 01:00:57.130
Smart.
Talented.

01:00:57.806 --> 01:00:59.276
Great legal department.

01:01:00.225 --> 01:01:01.849
Great working environment.

01:01:03.066 --> 01:01:06.313
You gotta be happy with those
first year stock options huh?

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.178
What are you talkin' about?

01:01:09.118 --> 01:01:11.706
Myles Strickland, the guy I was chasing...

01:01:12.346 --> 01:01:14.302
The guy you hired to kill Canter.

01:01:14.418 --> 01:01:17.116
- Tom you got it all wrong.
- You gave him the weapon.

01:01:17.431 --> 01:01:18.702
VSI makes them.

01:01:18.915 --> 01:01:22.224
They give one to you, you give it to
Strickland so he can go out and kill Canter.

01:01:22.339 --> 01:01:24.514
The only problem is, he
killed his son by mistake.

01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:27.562
- Something is wrong with you.
- Why are you doing this?

01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:30.448
Money? Is that what it is?

01:01:31.097 --> 01:01:32.730
You need help.

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:29.454
This is Stone. That son of a
bitch Greer disabled my unit!

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:30.383
Stop him!

01:02:33.828 --> 01:02:34.927
Go... Go!

01:02:46.476 --> 01:02:49.245
Jesus. No wonder VSI
wants Canter dead.

01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:51.147
He's in bed with The Prophet.

01:02:51.642 --> 01:02:53.563
He's funding the
Anti-Surrogacy Movement.

01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:55.153
He's given them names.

01:02:55.495 --> 01:02:58.913
Crazy bastard invents surragotes and
does everything he can to destroy them.

01:02:59.572 --> 01:03:02.818
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:04.700
He needed codes to use it.

01:03:05.024 --> 01:03:06.900
I want you to look for access codes.

01:03:08.126 --> 01:03:10.714
You get the codes... You nail Stone.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.101
Good job Agent Greer.
Thank you.

01:03:22.425 --> 01:03:24.851
This is Agent Peters. I found Greer.

01:03:24.966 --> 01:03:27.304
He's been in an accident at
Market and Hanover.

01:05:21.936 --> 01:05:24.308
- FBI!!!
- Get out of the car!

01:05:25.561 --> 01:05:26.562
He's gone.

01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:28.004
Scanning for identity chip.

01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:29.790
He doesn't have one, he's a meatbag!

01:05:29.906 --> 01:05:31.408
There's and exit in the back!

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:01.479
Hey! Where you going?!
HEY!!!

01:06:05.418 --> 01:06:07.780
Bobby it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

01:06:07.896 --> 01:06:09.890
Agent Peters has been hijacked.

01:06:10.005 --> 01:06:11.784
You gotta disconnect her.

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.255
Bobby?
Hello Bobby?

01:06:14.479 --> 01:06:15.742
Peters.

01:06:16.608 --> 01:06:17.879
Have you gone insane?

01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:21.116
Why don't you put the gun down? huh?
What are you trying to prove?

01:06:21.822 --> 01:06:24.365
She's grabbing into the entire 3rd network!

01:06:35.853 --> 01:06:38.269
Maggie get offline right away, as
soon as you get this message.

01:06:38.612 --> 01:06:40.632
Something is going to
happen to the surrogates.

01:06:41.828 --> 01:06:45.047
- She'll only speak to you sir. - Why don't
you just move in and take her down huh?

01:06:45.696 --> 01:06:46.904
She has a human hostage.

01:06:48.483 --> 01:06:49.917
Uh... the slob Saunders...

01:07:00.776 --> 01:07:01.596
Peters?

01:07:08.334 --> 01:07:10.272
Peters it's me Andy Stone.

01:07:10.989 --> 01:07:12.485
That's far enough Stone.

01:07:15.804 --> 01:07:17.697
I know who hired you to kill me.

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:22.505
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

01:07:23.822 --> 01:07:28.231
Did you feel even a second of remorse when
you found out you murdered an innocent boy?

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.201
Canter?

01:07:31.743 --> 01:07:32.934
I don't believe it.

01:07:33.853 --> 01:07:37.679
Ok... How about you tell me something Doctor.
Huh?

01:07:38.274 --> 01:07:40.295
What did you expect VSI to do?

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:43.469
Just stand by while you tore
down everything they built?

01:07:43.766 --> 01:07:45.840
You left us no choice
but to take you out.

01:07:46.618 --> 01:07:49.873
You created the technology, you changed
the world and now want to destroy it?

01:07:50.765 --> 01:07:51.505
So what?

01:07:52.550 --> 01:07:53.858
So you can take us backwards?

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.654
So we can all live like Dreads?

01:08:00.236 --> 01:08:02.147
So we can live like
human beings.

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:05.474
Really Doctor?

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.594
You should learn
how to live with your regrets.

01:08:10.526 --> 01:08:11.797
Now give me the gun.

01:08:37.995 --> 01:08:39.573
That's for my son.

01:08:52.443 --> 01:08:53.939
I need to see your boss.

01:08:54.055 --> 01:08:55.725
I need to see Dr. Canter right away!

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:58.259
Oh good... Listen to me... I
gotta to see your boss. Dr. Canter he...

01:09:16.517 --> 01:09:18.337

<i>Warning! Commencing Upload.</i>

01:11:17.616 --> 01:11:18.734
Hello Tom.

01:11:22.392 --> 01:11:24.097
Nice to finally meet you.

01:11:24.826 --> 01:11:25.882

01:11:32.702 --> 01:11:35.623
Now... Lie on the floor, face down.

01:11:38.036 --> 01:11:40.867
It's a little different when you have
to kill somebody with your own hands.

01:11:41.995 --> 01:11:44.871
You're going to have to squeeze the trigger.
You don't have a machine to do your dirty work.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:47.909
Feel that?

01:11:49.024 --> 01:11:51.414
An accelerated pulse, the
heightened awareness...

01:11:51.864 --> 01:11:54.037

as if it were your last.

01:11:54.551 --> 01:11:55.750
That what you've been missing.

01:11:56.463 --> 01:11:57.851
That's what everbodys been missing.

01:11:58.186 --> 01:12:02.424
- So you kill millions of people?
- I changed the course of human
history when I invented surrogates.

01:12:03.812 --> 01:12:05.472
Now I'm going to change it back.

01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.672
You can't change what's been done.

01:12:09.175 --> 01:12:10.934
You and I know that
better than most people.

01:12:12.053 --> 01:12:14.775
My son's death will not
have been in vain.

01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:17.769
Not if it heals mankind.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:19.819
Heals mankind?

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.155
That what you want to do?
You want to kill everyone?

01:12:23.524 --> 01:12:26.166
- And that's going to heal mankind?
- They're already dead.

01:12:26.282 --> 01:12:28.465
They died the minute they
plugged into those machines.

01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:29.767
This is not the solution.

01:12:29.883 --> 01:12:31.817
- That's the way it is.
- That's not the way it is!

01:12:31.913 --> 01:12:34.889
I had a vision. I was going
to empower the powerless.

01:12:35.421 --> 01:12:38.027
To enable other like me to walk, to feel.

01:12:38.679 --> 01:12:42.611
- To live a normal life.
- Listen to me! They're going to call you
a murderer! That is what you're doing!

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.441
Surrogacy is a perversion.

01:12:44.766 --> 01:12:45.911
It's an addiction.

01:12:46.026 --> 01:12:48.995
