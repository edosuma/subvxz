WEBVTT

00:54.763 --> 01:01.770
FUNERAL VENUE FOR THE YAMAMOTO FAMILY

01:33.676 --> 01:38.807
1999

01:57.325 --> 01:59.953
What were you up to at a time like this?

02:05.542 --> 02:06.709
Leave me alone.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.961
Unbelievable.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.383
Too bad.

02:19.305 --> 02:22.851
Lil Ken, put in an appearance afterward.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.611
MASAHARU YAMAMOTO

02:38.116 --> 02:39.742
It's an odd thing, right?

02:40.785 --> 02:44.622
The economy tanks
and more folks take to the needle.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.253
If I had just nabbed him,

02:50.962 --> 02:53.464
maybe he would still be alive.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.513
Lil Ken, what are you going to do next?

03:05.810 --> 03:09.272
Don't end up like your old man.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.859
It's none of your business.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.742
Is he all right?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.703
It's been a while.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.456
Are you listening?

03:26.539 --> 03:29.167
SHIZUOKA PREFECTURE
TABASAKI POLICE DEPARTMENT

03:32.795 --> 03:34.422
-Welcome back.
-Right.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.679
What are you pouting about?

03:42.430 --> 03:43.848
Come on. Let's go.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.821
Ken?

04:43.574 --> 04:44.784
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.202
What do you want?

04:47.370 --> 04:49.080
Sell me some. How much?

04:50.707 --> 04:53.126
I don't take new customers.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.544
You need a referral.

04:56.671 --> 04:57.672
Yamamoto.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.258
Masaharu Yamamoto.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.512
I see. Yamamoto, right?

05:07.056 --> 05:08.099
How much do you want?

05:18.276 --> 05:20.028
Hey! You little punk!

05:20.778 --> 05:22.530
-Dammit!
-Go!

05:35.335 --> 05:37.253
-Hurry up and climb.
-That hurts.

05:37.336 --> 05:39.672
-Here.
-Whoops.

05:40.506 --> 05:41.632
This is really crazy.

05:45.887 --> 05:46.721
How much?

05:46.804 --> 05:48.181
-Well?
-Is that 10,000 yen?

05:48.264 --> 05:49.640
-No way!
-I'm sure of it.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.559
-Keep it quiet.
-That's amazing, Ken.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.894
This is the best.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.194
-What do you want to eat?
-Maybe barbecue?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.573
This is really pretty.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.122
Hey…

06:14.999 --> 06:16.334
No!

06:18.711 --> 06:20.338
Now you've done it.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.342
That stuff's just garbage. Let's go.

06:24.884 --> 06:25.968
I'm going to OMONI.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.933
Half for Ken. Half for me.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.142
-Why?
-I'll sign.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.060
Why?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.104
Shut up. What do you do it for?

06:36.604 --> 06:38.022
The Ministry of Justice…

06:38.106 --> 06:39.982
I'm sorry for the wait.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.442
Thank you!

06:42.026 --> 06:45.696
Lil Ken, I'm sure things
will be difficult for you now.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.449
But think of me as your mother.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.409
Lean on me. Here.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.913
That's no good.
He wants a prettier mother.

06:53.996 --> 06:55.623
Quit messing around!

06:55.706 --> 06:58.000
-Eat up.
-We'll pay up today for sure.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.627
You should pay every time!

07:01.003 --> 07:03.089
-Can I have another beer?
-Sure thing.

07:03.881 --> 07:04.924
Mr. Shibazaki!

07:05.550 --> 07:06.717
Welcome.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.982
-Are you good with beer?
-Yes. Thank you.

07:21.065 --> 07:21.899
Got it.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.319
He is the head of the Shibazaki-gumi.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.822
He's got a serious aura to him.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.664
Thank you!

07:36.747 --> 07:37.582
I'm so full.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.208
-Are you eating?
-Yes.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.960
-One more.
-Wait a minute.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.130
How much can you eat?

07:44.839 --> 07:46.007
I'm not close to done.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.467
Are you going to eat?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.747
We got you, you fucking bastard.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.340
Get him!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.302
-Hey!
-Stop!

08:31.802 --> 08:32.887
Stop!

08:35.681 --> 08:36.724
Don't move!

08:37.517 --> 08:38.351
Don't move.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.105
Die!

09:03.334 --> 09:05.586
You guys are making too much noise.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.301
Ken, we need to go!

09:13.511 --> 09:15.096
Thanks for the meal, Aiko!

09:17.431 --> 09:19.058
Tsubasa.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.604
Boss, are you injured?

09:36.784 --> 09:39.161
CERTIFICATE OF EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE

10:24.790 --> 10:25.625
Hey.

10:28.044 --> 10:28.878
Hey.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.524
SHIBAZAKI-GUMI

10:53.569 --> 10:55.321
Nakamura is entering.

10:55.404 --> 10:57.114
-Welcome, sir.
-Keep up the good work.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.786
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.247
Excuse me.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.585
Hey.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.435
Come over here.

11:27.812 --> 11:28.729
Take a seat.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.625
Lil Ken…

11:50.918 --> 11:52.128
I hear they call you that.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.341
Have you eaten?

12:06.600 --> 12:09.228
Thank you for yesterday.

12:09.311 --> 12:11.730
I didn't do it to save you.

12:12.356 --> 12:13.524
Oh, really?

12:15.609 --> 12:19.029
I've known Aiko for a long time.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.702
Her husband was our lieutenant.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.039
Two years ago.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.916
So what?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.877
Just get to the point.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.088
Hey, you little punk.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.840
-Who do you think you're talking to?
-Makoto.

12:39.884 --> 12:45.014
It seems like you don't work.
You're just wandering around.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.058
What are your plans?

12:50.060 --> 12:51.729
I won't join the yakuza.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.654
Is it your father?

13:10.164 --> 13:11.874
I don't care about him.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.671
We…

13:19.840 --> 13:21.050
don't touch drugs.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.551
What do you do then?

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
What, indeed?

13:29.892 --> 13:30.809
-Nakamura.
-Yes, sir.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.354
-What do yakuza do?
-Yes, sir.

13:33.437 --> 13:37.233
Yakuza respect duty and honor,
strive to be gentlemen,

13:37.316 --> 13:39.527
and pursue the path
of becoming true men.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.696
This guy is so serious.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.158
Right? Let's eat.

13:46.784 --> 13:47.701
Eat up.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.371
-You're so serious.
-My apologies.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.046
HIROSHI SHIBAZAKI

14:07.513 --> 14:08.847
What is it?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.475
Kenji! Run away!

14:11.559 --> 14:12.476
What?

14:14.061 --> 14:14.895
I--

14:16.480 --> 14:17.565
Shit.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.237
It can't be.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.534
Grab him! Now!

14:29.368 --> 14:32.121
Dammit!

14:33.998 --> 14:37.042
Get him! You punk!

14:54.768 --> 14:56.145
That hurts!

15:02.359 --> 15:03.819
Quit it!

15:26.133 --> 15:29.136
Get him!

15:37.895 --> 15:40.147
-Tie him up.
-Got it.

15:41.523 --> 15:42.566
Come on.

16:01.377 --> 16:04.046
Hey. Wake up.

16:09.426 --> 16:12.012
Brother, he's up.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.696
I'm Kato, lieutenant of the Kyoyo-kai.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.532
Who are you?

16:33.617 --> 16:37.121
I heard you're Yamamoto's brat.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.751
Such a pity.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.171
Jumped into the ocean
because he had no cash for junk.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.885
Say something, punk!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.559
I'll kill you!

17:00.060 --> 17:02.271
Who do you think
you're talking to like that?

17:04.231 --> 17:07.568
Well? What did you do with what you stole?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.654
I don't know about that.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.117
Maybe I should ask your friends.

17:23.751 --> 17:30.049
I'm sorry! The ocean!
We threw it in the ocean!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.551
Seriously?

17:33.427 --> 17:37.014
Do you understand how much that cost?

17:38.182 --> 17:39.475
What do you want to do?

17:42.519 --> 17:43.687
Good timing.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.939
It's almost here.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.859
The boat from Hong Kong.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.822
Listen.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.994
Young organs will fetch a good price.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.416
Shut up!

18:05.626 --> 18:08.003
Get over here!

18:08.087 --> 18:09.963
Come on!

18:20.474 --> 18:22.309
Shut up, you punks!

18:33.237 --> 18:35.155
Come on. Get them off.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.325
-You're coming with us.
-Come on.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.789
Come on, you.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.755
Hey. Kawayama.

18:53.006 --> 18:56.051
-No evidence. Get the phones and wallets.
-Yes, sir.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.263
-Grab their phones and wallets.
-Yes.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.530
Brother!

19:23.829 --> 19:26.665
HIROSHI SHIBAZAKI

19:37.467 --> 19:38.385
Listen up.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.763
What is with this?

19:43.515 --> 19:44.516
Do you know Shibazaki?

19:48.228 --> 19:50.898
We struck a deal
with the Shibazaki-gumi before.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.067
Well?

19:56.778 --> 20:00.782
Did Shibazaki doodle on the back of this?

20:03.577 --> 20:08.415
If so, we need to assume that
the old man knows about this.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.045
I've got nothing to do
with the Shibazaki-gumi.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.428
I am…

20:24.973 --> 20:27.142
Kenji Yamamoto!

21:20.529 --> 21:22.155
-Yes?
-Excuse me.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.451
Get in here.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.455
Boss. It cost this much.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.500
Excuse me.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.562
It seems you really
gave them hell, Lil Ken.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.213
Do you have any place to go?

22:22.215 --> 22:23.342
Lil Ken.

22:57.542 --> 23:02.964
We shall now hold the Shibazaki-gumi
sharing of the familial cup ceremony.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.801
Please allow me to guide this ceremony.

23:06.301 --> 23:11.515
I am Tsutomu Nakamura, junior lieutenant
of the Shibazaki-gumi, Shouou-kai.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.143
Let us begin the ceremony.

23:17.270 --> 23:21.650
We pray to the deities
instilled in this cup.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.029
We shall now hold the familial
sharing of the cup ceremony

23:26.613 --> 23:31.243
of the Shibazaki-gumi
of the third-generation Shouou-kai.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.556
We are family now.

23:54.641 --> 23:55.725
Oyabun.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.603
I am honored.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.526
FAMILIAL CUP SHARING CEREMONY
AMATERASU

24:04.609 --> 24:06.528
PARENT: HIROSHI SHIBAZAKI
CHILD: KENJI YAMAMOTO

24:24.379 --> 24:28.091
Enjoying the best economy since WWII,

24:28.175 --> 24:31.928
the shopping district area of Kitaguchi
is being completely renovated.

24:58.705 --> 25:02.375
2005

25:19.601 --> 25:21.436
Excuse me. Right this way.

25:21.519 --> 25:22.646
-Good work.
-Thanks.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.105
-Good work.
-Thanks.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.526
Brother, congratulations
on becoming lieutenant.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.362
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

25:32.197 --> 25:36.826
This is embarrassing.
You didn't have to do all of this.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.120
What do you mean?

25:39.204 --> 25:42.415
You will be a central pillar
of our organization now.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.836
-Where is the boss?
-He doesn't like these places.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.089
-Sorry.
-I see.

25:49.172 --> 25:50.131
That's right.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.593
Excuse me. This is from Yamamoto.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.991
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.493
Okay.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.498
-Let's drink tonight.
-Yes, sir.

26:23.581 --> 26:24.708
Brother.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.335
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

26:54.487 --> 26:58.491
Corresponding to the redevelopment
of the Kitaguchi area,

26:58.575 --> 27:02.120
we will be aiming to
dismantle the red light district

27:02.203 --> 27:05.332
and three restaurant and bar areas
in three years until 2008.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.001
The north belongs to the Kyoyo-kai.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.462
They won't just keep quiet.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.008
It is certainly possible
that their conflict

27:15.091 --> 27:18.428
with the Shibazaki-gumi in the south
could reignite after eight years.

27:20.013 --> 27:23.391
This is a good opportunity.
Nab all of the members

27:24.100 --> 27:25.977
of the Kyoyo-kai and
the Shibazaki-gumi that fight.

27:26.061 --> 27:26.895
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

27:33.109 --> 27:34.319
I see.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.197
As long as you all had a fun time.

27:37.280 --> 27:39.574
Yes. The lieutenant
was very happy as well.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.078
Well? How are you doing?

27:43.953 --> 27:46.873
The pressure from the cops
is as heavy as always,

27:46.956 --> 27:48.958
but our income is rising steadily.

27:49.042 --> 27:52.587
Someday, I will make you
the head of the Shouou-kai.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.423
-Not that.
-What?

27:56.466 --> 27:57.675
Do you have a girl?

27:58.176 --> 28:01.471
No. Well, I don't--

28:01.554 --> 28:03.598
-That's no good.
-Sorry.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.351
If you get old alone like me,

28:07.268 --> 28:09.854
you'll end up dying
without anyone noticing.

28:09.938 --> 28:10.772
No.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.568
You have us.

28:17.612 --> 28:18.530
Yes.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.366
Boss. It's about time.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.160
Hello, boss.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.871
-Are you making money?
-Yes. Thanks to you.

28:26.955 --> 28:27.997
Hello.

28:32.127 --> 28:35.088
Lil Ken. Thanks for everything.

28:35.171 --> 28:38.591
Aiko, quit it with that nickname.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.969
Lil Ken is Lil Ken
even if you are an adult.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.554
-I guess so.
-Three beers.

28:42.637 --> 28:43.722
Got it.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.395
You're studying hard, Tsubasa.
That's really good.

28:50.478 --> 28:51.312
Yes.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.276
Put out your hand.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.489
There, buy something you want, all right?

29:03.491 --> 29:04.868
-Can I?
-Sure.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.747
People always need more money. Take it.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.207
-Thanks, Uncle Ken!
-Sure.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.376
Sorry for the wait!

29:13.460 --> 29:17.714
Tsubasa. You'll join our family
once you get older.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.924
What are you saying? Of course not.

29:20.008 --> 29:20.842
Sorry.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.053
-Tsubasa, don't turn out like us.
-Okay.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.263
Don't agree with him!

29:26.848 --> 29:28.099
Cheers.

29:28.933 --> 29:29.768
Sorry!

29:34.189 --> 29:35.440
Think about your future.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.275
You don't want to be like us.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.403
Did you take a bath yesterday?

29:40.487 --> 29:41.571
Hello?

29:41.654 --> 29:43.114
You.

29:44.032 --> 29:44.866
Yes.

29:46.493 --> 29:47.452
Got it.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.497
-I'm sorry, Aiko. We've got to go.
-What?

29:54.584 --> 29:56.753
-See you again, Tsubasa.
-Okay.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.714
This is for you, Aiko.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.759
Tsubasa, catch.

30:04.135 --> 30:05.053
Later.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.639
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

30:19.150 --> 30:22.320
Ken. He suddenly got mad about his bill.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.453
I was wondering who was going to show up.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.497
Turns out it's Yamamoto.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.293
Well, I guess I knew that.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.505
You are bothering the other guests.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.048
Come outside.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.926
You sound so tough.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
You might get captured
like back in the day.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.517
Quit screwing around!

30:52.600 --> 30:56.145
What's with you, punk?

31:00.358 --> 31:01.359
Yamamoto,

31:02.986 --> 31:06.489
what will happen
to this town in ten years?

31:08.157 --> 31:10.201
Kitaguchi is getting redeveloped.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.080
It'll get tougher and tougher
to make money here.

31:14.831 --> 31:18.167
We're going to have to change.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.794
So what?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.089
Tell your boss

31:23.715 --> 31:26.092
to get out of the south.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.929
In exchange, we'll pay you 20 percent.

31:30.013 --> 31:30.930
Not too shabby, right?

31:35.602 --> 31:36.644
I'll make it simple.

31:38.229 --> 31:42.734
If that obsolete old man doesn't resign,

31:43.610 --> 31:45.904
this town will be left behind.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.076
Take care of that for me.

31:59.000 --> 31:59.918
What did you do?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.715
You punk!

32:06.925 --> 32:09.385
Take this!

32:10.219 --> 32:11.679
Brother!

32:11.763 --> 32:13.556
-Brother!
-Enough.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.773
That hurt.

32:28.696 --> 32:30.823
I'll have to tell the boss about this.

32:32.575 --> 32:37.288
Do you understand
what going to war with us would mean?

32:40.124 --> 32:42.669
Come on. Let's go.

32:53.888 --> 32:54.931
Brother.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.520
Mama. Drinks.

33:01.312 --> 33:04.148
Yes. That was scary, wasn't it?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.525
-Rena.
-Yes.

33:07.485 --> 33:08.569
Excuse me.

33:11.864 --> 33:14.033
-Here.
-Please.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.663
Please help me here.

33:21.916 --> 33:24.168
-Drink up.
-Got it.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.175
That's…

33:57.785 --> 33:58.828
There.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.343
-Thanks for today, Ken.
-Sure.

34:14.427 --> 34:15.845
It's fine.

34:16.471 --> 34:17.472
Mama.

34:21.934 --> 34:23.936
That's for the girl who sat next to him.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.482
Ken?

34:28.274 --> 34:29.442
Thanks for the help.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.739
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.620
-Miyuki.
-Yes?

34:41.120 --> 34:42.038
Just a minute.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.554
Get in here.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.988
Well… I'm here.

35:17.698 --> 35:18.908
Come over here.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.549
Sit.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.522
It's fine. Sit closer.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.081
-Hey, you!
-No…

36:07.165 --> 36:08.332
Wait!

36:08.875 --> 36:11.627
Wait! Please stop!

36:15.131 --> 36:16.924
You!

36:17.008 --> 36:18.885
Stop!

36:19.719 --> 36:23.264
-Stop!
-Wait!

36:24.265 --> 36:25.474
Wait!

36:26.058 --> 36:27.226
Wait a second!

36:37.862 --> 36:39.530
What are you, a virgin?

36:40.364 --> 36:41.282
What?

36:42.408 --> 36:43.242
No.

36:43.326 --> 36:46.078
So what's the problem?
You knew what coming here meant.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.081
-Why?
-What?

36:50.708 --> 36:52.919
I just came here because Mama told me to.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.880
Then you should just follow
Mama's instructions.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.299
That's why I came!

36:59.675 --> 37:01.469
That's not going to cut it.

37:02.261 --> 37:03.804
It's all part of the deal.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.807
-What deal?
-What?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.310
A deal is a deal.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.812
Don't make me explain it.
Figure it out yourself.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.190
So? What are you looking at?

37:14.273 --> 37:16.400
Idiot. I wouldn't mess around with you.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.318
You just tried to.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.987
I didn't. I would never do that with you.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.197
You just tried to!

37:21.280 --> 37:22.531
I did not.

37:35.002 --> 37:35.836
Hey.

37:43.594 --> 37:44.553
Give it to me.

37:45.554 --> 37:46.389
What?

37:59.694 --> 38:00.528
Here.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.958
I understand.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.797
We'll go to the place you want, Kato.

38:20.715 --> 38:23.259
Yes. Got it.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.470
Hey! Do you realize what you did?

38:27.930 --> 38:29.015
Start talking!

38:29.098 --> 38:31.767
I couldn't let him disrespect us.

38:32.977 --> 38:36.063
I get what Lil Ken says.
Kato is disrespecting us.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.067
He's trying to take over
the territory of the south.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.278
I'll speak with Kato myself.

38:42.361 --> 38:45.197
No. What can you do alone?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.408
I was the one who messed up Kawayama.

38:47.491 --> 38:48.784
What?

38:50.453 --> 38:52.455
Who do you think you're talking back to?

38:54.206 --> 38:55.374
Oyabun just came in.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.671
I'm going to meet with Kato.

39:00.755 --> 39:02.089
-Boss.
-Nakamura.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.007
Yes, sir.

39:07.261 --> 39:12.433
Lil Ken, try letting Brother Nakamura
have the spotlight sometimes.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.787
This is about our territory.

39:34.622 --> 39:36.499
Our boss is here.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.710
Isn't this odd?

39:42.129 --> 39:44.715
The punk who started this isn't even here.

39:45.424 --> 39:46.384
Right.

39:47.301 --> 39:48.427
Kato.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.639
-Yes?
-This is a fight between children.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.723
My apologies.

39:54.975 --> 39:55.893
Well?

39:58.771 --> 40:00.564
How will you fix this?

40:03.734 --> 40:04.735
Fix what?

40:06.529 --> 40:08.280
What?

40:10.574 --> 40:11.784
Are you going senile?

40:13.702 --> 40:16.705
You can't just beat up
one of our lieutenants, you know.

40:19.708 --> 40:20.835
Hey, Kato.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.713
Don't push me too far.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.009
Shibazaki.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.889
The times have changed.

40:35.850 --> 40:39.353
You should leave the south to us,
don't you think?

40:41.272 --> 40:42.940
Let's work together.

40:45.651 --> 40:46.902
Eight years ago,

40:48.737 --> 40:50.948
I agreed to a deal
because the family told me to.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.911
But I haven't forgotten

40:57.288 --> 40:58.914
that you targeted our Kimura.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.961
Don't make me laugh!

41:05.296 --> 41:08.674
What? You killed our last boss.

41:09.592 --> 41:12.178
Don't think a little thug
like Kimura is a fair trade!

41:15.681 --> 41:16.891
In that case,

41:18.684 --> 41:23.314
why don't you try taking me out, Kato?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.528
Do it if you think you can!

41:30.779 --> 41:32.281
You thug.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.685
The person you called
cannot answer at this time.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.562
Why no answer?

42:30.673 --> 42:31.590
Get in.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.635
But I have work until the last shift.

42:34.718 --> 42:36.554
It's fine. Get in.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.430
But I have to get up early tomorrow.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.182
Just get in the car!

42:41.058 --> 42:43.727
But I need to ask Mama for permission.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.145
Everything is Mama.

42:45.229 --> 42:48.983
"Mama." Don't you have your own brain?

42:52.027 --> 42:53.028
I can't.

42:53.529 --> 42:54.697
Have a good night.

42:59.577 --> 43:03.581
-Wait! Stop that!
-Get in.

43:12.798 --> 43:15.426
-Listen, you.
-Yuka.

43:18.637 --> 43:20.598
Why are you working at our club?

43:26.270 --> 43:29.315
-One reason or another.
-What does that mean?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.693
I couldn't pay tuition.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.989
Tuition?

43:39.241 --> 43:40.534
You're a student?

43:40.618 --> 43:42.036
Is that bad?

43:42.119 --> 43:46.165
No. You just look old for a student.

43:50.085 --> 43:52.004
I'm getting out. Let me out.

43:52.087 --> 43:54.715
Idiot! Stop!

43:54.798 --> 43:56.759
-Idiot.
-Apologize.

43:56.842 --> 43:57.676
What?

44:00.638 --> 44:02.806
Wait! Stop!

44:18.280 --> 44:19.698
Why the ocean?

44:21.241 --> 44:22.618
One reason or another.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.542
I haven't seen the ocean
since I came here.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.263
Hey, Yamamoto.

44:44.139 --> 44:44.973
What?

44:46.433 --> 44:48.394
Why are you a yakuza?

44:50.354 --> 44:51.939
It's none of your business.

44:54.817 --> 44:59.696
How do the yakuza live?

45:00.322 --> 45:04.493
Why do yakuza wear sunglasses at night?

45:05.369 --> 45:10.207
Right. Why do yakuza call each other
"Boss" and "Brother" like that?

45:11.500 --> 45:13.836
I'll drown you!

45:13.919 --> 45:15.546
Don't touch me.

45:15.629 --> 45:16.839
I didn't touch you.

45:21.218 --> 45:25.139
I never thought
I would meet the real thing.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.057
Are there real and fake ones?

45:34.898 --> 45:38.235
Answer me. Why are you a yakuza?

45:47.619 --> 45:50.664
They're my family. No reasons are needed.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.044
What about your real family?

46:00.048 --> 46:01.300
I don't have one.

46:19.985 --> 46:21.320
Me neither.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.296
Hey, are you going back?

46:45.844 --> 46:46.970
Hurry up and come.

46:55.312 --> 46:57.940
-Hey!
-What is it?

47:01.443 --> 47:03.487
-Isn't it dark?
-What are you talking about?

47:03.570 --> 47:06.240
-The sunglasses.
-It isn't dark, idiot.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.051
What is it?

47:29.263 --> 47:30.639
I got it. I'm on my way.

47:35.852 --> 47:39.314
Old folks have so much time.

47:39.398 --> 47:42.025
You're pretty good at fishing,
right, Ohara?

47:43.360 --> 47:44.987
I'm not good at it.

47:47.656 --> 47:51.493
What's the problem?
You see me wearing this too.

47:51.577 --> 47:52.703
Right, Ohara?

47:52.786 --> 47:53.954
I love it.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.415
Don't make the boss
wear something like that.

47:56.498 --> 47:57.499
Sorry!

47:58.000 --> 48:03.297
This guy is always going on and on
about "Mr. Kenji."

48:03.380 --> 48:04.881
All he does is talk about you.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.009
Don't go running your mouth, idiot.

48:07.092 --> 48:07.926
Sorry!

48:12.556 --> 48:13.682
That's right…

48:14.683 --> 48:16.935
we ended up ripping up our deal

48:17.811 --> 48:19.396
with Kato.

48:21.273 --> 48:22.232
Boss.

48:22.316 --> 48:24.985
-Yes?
-I apologize for causing you trouble.

48:25.986 --> 48:28.322
-Don't worry about that little thug.
-Yes, boss.

48:28.989 --> 48:32.492
But if anything happens to me,

48:32.576 --> 48:34.745
it'll be your generation's turn to shine.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.664
-Make me proud.
-What are you saying?

48:39.207 --> 48:41.627
I will protect you with my life.

48:43.545 --> 48:46.465
That's nice to hear. You hear that, Ohara?

48:46.548 --> 48:49.217
Yes! I'll protect both of you.

48:49.301 --> 48:51.511
You couldn't even protect an ant, idiot.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.270
-Boss.
-Yes?

49:00.354 --> 49:02.689
-Well…
-You got a woman?

49:02.773 --> 49:04.650
-What?
-What? Really?

49:04.733 --> 49:06.652
-Shut up!
-It's all over your face.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.195
I don't know.

49:08.695 --> 49:11.365
She's a stubborn woman.
I don't know about her yet.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.283
I'm glad for you.

49:15.035 --> 49:16.328
Take care of her.

49:17.120 --> 49:17.996
Yes.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.164
Boss! Get down!

49:35.472 --> 49:37.974
Boss, are you okay?

49:39.935 --> 49:40.936
I'm okay.

50:33.155 --> 50:34.656
This can't be true.

50:37.743 --> 50:38.785
Hey.

50:46.334 --> 50:47.544
Hey!

50:50.547 --> 50:51.757
Hey!

50:56.219 --> 50:57.387
Ohara!

50:57.929 --> 51:00.474
Hey! Ohara!

51:01.308 --> 51:04.144
Answer me! Hey!

51:11.026 --> 51:12.235
Ohara.

52:17.008 --> 52:20.554
No, Chairman. I cannot accept this.

52:21.304 --> 52:22.472
One of our young members…

52:52.252 --> 52:53.753
It's all karma.

52:55.046 --> 52:58.425
The folks who should die actually don't.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.803
The unfortunate ones die first.

53:03.221 --> 53:05.348
It's the same as Kimura eight years ago.

53:07.851 --> 53:12.105
We will take care of this incident.
Don't make any moves.

53:12.188 --> 53:13.732
Kato targeted the boss.

53:13.815 --> 53:16.568
Shibazaki, you understand, right?

53:17.485 --> 53:22.532
If this goes any further, it would cause
trouble for your family, the Shouou-kai.

53:22.616 --> 53:24.492
Our Ohara was killed!

53:25.619 --> 53:27.537
Are you determined to make a move on them?

53:30.165 --> 53:34.544
Everyone in the Shibazaki-gumi
will be lost.

53:38.131 --> 53:43.011
It is no longer just the role of police
and the law to punish the yakuza.

53:43.720 --> 53:46.806
The entire world shall exterminate you.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.396
Times are changing.

54:01.988 --> 54:04.157
-Boss.
-Stay there.

54:04.658 --> 54:05.659
I'm okay.

54:10.205 --> 54:12.791
How is your injury?

54:13.708 --> 54:15.710
I can move now.

54:16.544 --> 54:17.587
Let me do it.

54:26.763 --> 54:27.681
Lil Ken.

54:30.642 --> 54:31.977
I've decided…

54:36.648 --> 54:39.609
to let the police handle this.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.283
What are you saying?

54:49.577 --> 54:51.287
They killed Ohara.

54:52.998 --> 54:54.207
I know.

54:57.168 --> 55:00.213
Boss. This is all my fault.

55:01.297 --> 55:03.383
Please let me finish it.

55:07.345 --> 55:08.346
Lil Ken.

55:11.516 --> 55:13.143
It's over.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.866
At 11 a.m. on the fifth of this month,

55:27.949 --> 55:32.579
a vehicle carrying the head of a group
in the organized crime group Shouou-kai

55:32.662 --> 55:36.332
was shot while traveling in Tabasaki City.

55:37.292 --> 55:41.296
The deceased body of one adult male
was found inside.

55:42.088 --> 55:44.674
An Asian man was arrested

55:44.758 --> 55:46.718
as a suspect for this murder.

55:46.801 --> 55:48.344
He has refused to cooperate…

56:39.395 --> 56:41.564
-Leave it to us.
-Good timing.

56:41.648 --> 56:43.525
-Welcome.
-Hello.

56:43.608 --> 56:44.526
Please take a seat.

56:46.277 --> 56:47.153
Here.

57:09.759 --> 57:11.261
Shut your mouth!

57:25.316 --> 57:26.276
Kawayama.

58:05.356 --> 58:06.357
Brother.

58:15.200 --> 58:16.284
Kenji.

58:20.538 --> 58:23.500
Take good care of the boss.

58:31.883 --> 58:34.093
Brother. Let's go.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.555
We need you to support the boss!

58:42.685 --> 58:44.103
Come on!

59:05.250 --> 59:08.211
Hey! Out of the way!

59:08.294 --> 59:09.629
Move!

59:09.712 --> 59:11.464
Hey! Move!

59:47.041 --> 59:47.917
Who is it?

59:58.970 --> 1:00:00.096
Get in quickly.

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:10.690
Sit.

1:00:20.491 --> 1:00:21.409
Here.

1:00:31.669 --> 1:00:32.754
Take your clothes off.

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:48.199
You make a father proud.

1:04:28.865 --> 1:04:29.740
Let's go.

1:04:31.242 --> 1:04:34.036
An organized crime member was murdered

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:37.373
at Club Smoke in Tabasaki City.

1:04:37.456 --> 1:04:40.334
At 8 a.m. this morning…

1:04:40.418 --> 1:04:41.544
Mom!

1:04:41.627 --> 1:04:43.921
…a suspect was arrested.

1:04:45.089 --> 1:04:47.884
The man arrested on suspicion
of murder was Kenji Yamamoto,

1:04:47.967 --> 1:04:51.137
a member of the Shouou-kai
organized crime group.

1:04:51.220 --> 1:04:53.389
The suspect is 25 years old.

1:04:54.390 --> 1:04:57.393
Yamamoto admitted to the police

1:04:57.476 --> 1:05:00.062
that he stabbed him.

1:06:00.623 --> 1:06:03.751
2019

1:06:03.834 --> 1:06:07.922
14 YEARS LATER

1:06:57.096 --> 1:07:00.641
DON QUIXOTE

1:07:16.532 --> 1:07:17.658
Excuse me.

1:07:25.499 --> 1:07:29.837
SHIBAZAKI-GUMI

1:07:53.736 --> 1:07:54.570
Yes?

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:55.988
Excuse me.

1:08:04.205 --> 1:08:05.289
Excuse me.

1:08:20.179 --> 1:08:21.263
Boss.

1:08:23.140 --> 1:08:24.600
I have returned.

1:08:33.359 --> 1:08:34.443
Welcome back.

1:08:51.836 --> 1:08:54.672
Thank you for the clothes.

1:08:57.216 --> 1:08:58.259
They look good on you.

1:09:11.438 --> 1:09:14.692
This is just a token of my appreciation.

1:09:19.655 --> 1:09:20.614
Sorry.

1:09:23.033 --> 1:09:24.410
Thank you.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:51.228
Okay.

1:09:53.105 --> 1:09:54.023
Go ahead.

1:10:05.075 --> 1:10:06.160
This is your key.

1:10:07.119 --> 1:10:07.953
Okay.

1:10:09.121 --> 1:10:11.874
This is from Brother Nakamura.

1:10:20.299 --> 1:10:22.259
I can buy a cell phone myself.

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:25.763
No. You can't. Not now.

1:10:26.513 --> 1:10:27.431
What?

1:10:27.932 --> 1:10:32.436
You could, but the laws
around cell phone contracts

1:10:32.519 --> 1:10:34.605
make buying a phone a pain.

1:10:35.189 --> 1:10:36.357
For yakuza.

1:10:48.702 --> 1:10:52.790
The phone number you called
is not currently in use.

1:10:52.873 --> 1:10:57.378
Please confirm the number and redial.

1:11:00.673 --> 1:11:06.387
Today, our brother, Kenji Yamamoto,
returned after serving his sentence.

1:11:07.137 --> 1:11:09.223
He withstood a 14-year sentence

1:11:09.807 --> 1:11:12.434
and returned to us.

1:11:13.018 --> 1:11:16.897
The entire Shibazaki-gumi
wishes to celebrate this occasion.

1:11:18.524 --> 1:11:19.358
Well, then.

1:11:21.819 --> 1:11:23.946
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:11:34.164 --> 1:11:35.499
Thank you.

1:11:44.008 --> 1:11:45.009
Okay.

1:11:45.718 --> 1:11:49.555
I'll leave the rest to you.

1:11:54.643 --> 1:11:56.353
Brother, are you all right?

1:11:56.437 --> 1:11:57.354
Sure.

1:12:09.241 --> 1:12:12.286
Is something wrong with the boss?

1:12:15.539 --> 1:12:16.707
Three years ago,

1:12:19.793 --> 1:12:21.378
he was diagnosed with cancer.

1:12:27.509 --> 1:12:30.971
Last year, doctors found
that it had metastasized.

1:12:33.182 --> 1:12:34.933
He acts tough,

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:37.311
but he must be suffering.

1:12:38.896 --> 1:12:39.813
Lil Ken.

1:12:41.815 --> 1:12:43.609
There aren't many of us now, you know?

1:12:45.694 --> 1:12:46.570
Yes.

1:12:48.322 --> 1:12:50.240
Everyone quit.

1:12:52.368 --> 1:12:53.619
It wasn't just the law.

1:12:54.661 --> 1:12:59.458
An ordinance was issued eight years ago,
and a bunch of us were swept up.

1:13:00.709 --> 1:13:01.877
What about our territory?

1:13:04.254 --> 1:13:07.049
Kato and Osako did a number on us.

1:13:09.259 --> 1:13:10.469
Everything is gone.

1:13:12.221 --> 1:13:14.264
How are we making money now?

1:13:21.188 --> 1:13:23.524
They're so small.

1:13:25.025 --> 1:13:26.485
They're transparent.

1:13:26.568 --> 1:13:27.861
They're really hard to get.

1:13:30.948 --> 1:13:32.032
I got some!

1:13:32.741 --> 1:13:33.909
Here.

1:13:33.992 --> 1:13:35.786
These will fetch a good price.

1:13:37.746 --> 1:13:39.373
Look. Baby eels.

1:13:42.334 --> 1:13:43.919
Nice catch.

1:13:44.503 --> 1:13:46.547
They're feeding us now.

1:13:52.177 --> 1:13:54.805
-Thank you.
-Goodnight.

1:13:54.888 --> 1:14:00.477
OMONI

1:14:00.561 --> 1:14:01.937
Lil Ken.

1:14:04.398 --> 1:14:07.901
-Long time no see.
-Lil Ken! Welcome back!

1:14:07.985 --> 1:14:09.361
When did you get out?

1:14:09.945 --> 1:14:11.029
Last week.

1:14:13.157 --> 1:14:14.032
He's here.

1:14:33.677 --> 1:14:34.511
Here.

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:36.305
What?

1:14:37.806 --> 1:14:39.308
Kids are cute.

1:14:39.933 --> 1:14:41.768
She looks just like you.

1:14:42.269 --> 1:14:43.520
Congratulations.

1:14:46.732 --> 1:14:48.192
What are you up to now?

1:14:52.821 --> 1:14:53.989
Industrial waste.

1:14:54.490 --> 1:14:57.534
What can I say?
They hired me two years ago.

1:14:58.243 --> 1:14:59.244
Right.

1:15:02.998 --> 1:15:05.959
Did something happen
between you and the boss?

1:15:07.586 --> 1:15:09.296
No, well…

1:15:11.465 --> 1:15:13.842
I figured it was just time to move on.

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:16.678
I tried to keep it up until you came back.

1:15:16.762 --> 1:15:18.639
Some random driver hit my car.

1:15:19.806 --> 1:15:21.934
I got arrested
just for requesting a repair.

1:15:24.937 --> 1:15:27.356
I figured that was the end of the line.

1:15:32.194 --> 1:15:33.320
Sorry.

1:15:37.407 --> 1:15:40.077
Are you doing okay now?

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:40.994
Yes.

1:15:41.703 --> 1:15:44.373
Living paycheck to paycheck,
but I am living.

1:15:44.456 --> 1:15:45.374
Right.

1:15:45.999 --> 1:15:47.793
Those five years were hell though.

1:15:49.419 --> 1:15:50.379
Five years?

1:15:53.966 --> 1:15:55.133
The five-year rule.

1:15:57.052 --> 1:15:58.387
After you quit the yakuza,

1:16:00.472 --> 1:16:03.600
it takes five years before society
can treat you like a person.

1:16:05.769 --> 1:16:08.897
No bank account. No insurance. No home.

1:16:12.025 --> 1:16:12.943
Right.

1:16:14.653 --> 1:16:16.280
-I'm sorry for the wait.
-It's okay.

1:16:19.199 --> 1:16:20.993
-It looks good.
-Right.

1:16:21.076 --> 1:16:22.869
We ate this a lot back in the day.

1:16:22.953 --> 1:16:23.787
We did.

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:27.082
-Eat up.
-Sorry. I'll go ahead first.

1:16:33.088 --> 1:16:34.548
-Thank you for this meal.
-Right.

1:16:40.137 --> 1:16:41.930
-Hosono.
-Yes?

1:16:42.014 --> 1:16:43.765
Do you remember a girl named Yuka?

1:16:45.559 --> 1:16:47.477
-From the club?
-Yes.

1:16:47.561 --> 1:16:48.437
I remember her.

1:16:50.647 --> 1:16:54.568
Do you know what she's doing now?

1:16:55.068 --> 1:16:58.739
Who knows? That was quite a while ago.

1:16:58.822 --> 1:16:59.865
Right.

1:16:59.948 --> 1:17:01.450
Should I ask around?

1:17:02.117 --> 1:17:03.160
Thanks.

1:17:07.664 --> 1:17:09.875
Yes!

1:17:12.628 --> 1:17:14.046
Nice!

1:17:14.713 --> 1:17:17.049
Go! Get him!

1:17:24.973 --> 1:17:27.517
All right!

1:17:27.601 --> 1:17:30.145
Yes!

1:17:31.396 --> 1:17:33.231
Tonight was a crazy match.

1:17:33.315 --> 1:17:35.692
That last right hook was wild.

1:17:35.776 --> 1:17:37.444
-Seriously.
-Nice match.

1:17:37.527 --> 1:17:39.237
Nice fight!

1:17:39.738 --> 1:17:41.615
-Good match.
-Good match.

1:17:41.698 --> 1:17:43.158
Thanks.

1:17:43.241 --> 1:17:44.993
Nice fight.

1:17:45.077 --> 1:17:46.328
Thanks.

1:17:46.411 --> 1:17:49.831
-Hey, congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1:17:50.916 --> 1:17:52.417
Want to watch the video?

1:17:52.501 --> 1:17:54.836
-It was a really great one.
-Right?

1:17:55.337 --> 1:17:56.797
That would make a great video.

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.799
I captured it really well.

1:18:00.884 --> 1:18:02.969
No one in this area can beat him.

1:18:11.395 --> 1:18:13.438
It's my wife. I need to be going.

1:18:13.522 --> 1:18:14.439
I see.

1:18:15.065 --> 1:18:17.025
Aiko, what's the damage?

1:18:18.568 --> 1:18:20.821
-It's on me today.
-Let us pay.

1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:23.073
I've got this.

1:18:23.156 --> 1:18:26.451
-No. Really.
-I'm paying for this.

1:18:26.535 --> 1:18:27.494
-Five thousand?
-Yes.

1:18:27.994 --> 1:18:29.037
It's okay.

1:18:29.621 --> 1:18:30.872
What are you doing?

1:18:31.373 --> 1:18:32.499
Enough!

1:18:35.127 --> 1:18:35.961
Sorry.

1:18:36.545 --> 1:18:37.879
Hey, Hosono!

1:18:38.463 --> 1:18:39.881
What's wrong with you?

1:18:41.299 --> 1:18:42.676
You're acting weird.

1:18:49.683 --> 1:18:51.184
If I'm seen with you,

1:18:52.477 --> 1:18:55.480
they'll call me a criminal.

1:18:58.608 --> 1:19:01.111
The situation has changed
since we worked together.

1:19:02.946 --> 1:19:04.865
I apologize. Excuse me.

1:19:18.211 --> 1:19:21.965
What is with him?

1:19:24.217 --> 1:19:25.218
Sorry.

1:19:38.356 --> 1:19:39.274
Uncle Ken?

1:19:41.610 --> 1:19:42.778
It's Uncle Ken!

1:19:46.239 --> 1:19:49.493
It's me, Tsubasa.

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:57.709
-Tsubasa?
-Yes.

1:20:02.088 --> 1:20:04.841
-Good evening.
-Evening. Making money?

1:20:04.925 --> 1:20:06.551
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:20:06.635 --> 1:20:07.803
Yes.

1:20:10.639 --> 1:20:14.017
-This town has changed a lot, right?
-Yes.

1:20:15.393 --> 1:20:16.603
This way.

1:20:18.355 --> 1:20:19.981
You know what happened?

1:20:21.066 --> 1:20:24.945
Since a few years ago,
yakuza can't work out in the open.

1:20:25.695 --> 1:20:28.073
We've been running the clubs instead.

1:20:28.156 --> 1:20:28.990
I see.

1:20:29.950 --> 1:20:30.784
Over here.

1:20:32.869 --> 1:20:36.957
Hey! Are you trying to steal from me?

1:20:37.457 --> 1:20:38.708
I will not be quiet!

1:20:39.334 --> 1:20:40.752
Where is your manager?

1:20:40.836 --> 1:20:44.130
There's no way I can pay this bill!
You're trying to screw me.

1:20:46.508 --> 1:20:47.342
Tsubasa.

1:20:48.301 --> 1:20:49.386
What are you doing?

1:20:49.469 --> 1:20:51.096
Stop it. What are you doing?

1:20:51.179 --> 1:20:53.682
-Hey. Listen up.
-What?

1:20:54.432 --> 1:20:57.936
You have a problem with your bill?
You're pouting because you can't pay?

1:20:58.019 --> 1:21:00.730
That's too pathetic. Pay up.

1:21:01.606 --> 1:21:02.816
Who are you?

1:21:03.441 --> 1:21:06.361
Fine. I'll go to the police.

1:21:06.987 --> 1:21:09.155
Fine with me, but you're an idiot.

1:21:10.198 --> 1:21:13.243
The police won't bother
with petty stuff like this.

1:21:13.743 --> 1:21:16.621
You don't have a case.
If you don't mind losing, let's go.

1:21:18.331 --> 1:21:20.125
Thank you.

1:21:21.918 --> 1:21:23.837
Need to grab cash
at the convenience store?

1:21:24.713 --> 1:21:25.755
Let's go.

1:21:32.053 --> 1:21:33.930
Sorry about that.

1:21:35.015 --> 1:21:36.683
-No.
-Please.

1:21:38.310 --> 1:21:42.314
It is a shocker to see you
like this, Tsubasa.

1:21:44.357 --> 1:21:47.068
-I really respect what you did.
-No way.

1:21:47.986 --> 1:21:51.573
You got revenge for Ohara
and did your time. That's so cool.

1:21:55.785 --> 1:21:57.579
That's all ancient history.

1:21:58.538 --> 1:22:03.335
Did you know that my old man
was a yakuza in the Shibazaki-gumi?

1:22:03.877 --> 1:22:04.961
Hajime Kimura.

1:22:05.670 --> 1:22:07.172
I heard about it.

1:22:07.255 --> 1:22:09.257
My mom hid that forever.

1:22:09.341 --> 1:22:11.384
She should've just told me.

1:22:11.468 --> 1:22:14.179
He got killed in some fight.

1:22:14.262 --> 1:22:16.139
She should've told me that too.

1:22:16.222 --> 1:22:18.433
She was thinking of you.

1:22:18.975 --> 1:22:20.977
-Really?
-Yes.

1:22:26.441 --> 1:22:27.692
Has a lot changed?

1:22:33.782 --> 1:22:36.701
-Yes.
-I guess that makes sense.

1:22:36.785 --> 1:22:39.829
You can't eat with duty and honor alone.

1:22:41.456 --> 1:22:43.583
I think it's really too bad.

1:22:48.672 --> 1:22:52.425
That's right,
I'm helping out Nakamura with his work

1:22:53.009 --> 1:22:55.679
because I really loved you.

1:22:56.554 --> 1:22:58.056
What about him?

1:23:01.184 --> 1:23:02.310
Haven't you heard?

1:23:03.144 --> 1:23:03.979
What?

1:23:05.897 --> 1:23:08.692
He made me do a lot of dirty work.

1:23:09.693 --> 1:23:12.237
I guess I don't have much of a choice.

1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:13.321
Tsubasa.

1:23:15.615 --> 1:23:17.075
What work?

1:23:19.619 --> 1:23:20.704
Well…

1:23:20.787 --> 1:23:25.417
This month's sales are 1,300,000 yen.
Expenditures are 250,000 yen.

1:23:26.751 --> 1:23:29.421
Revenues are low this month as well,

1:23:29.921 --> 1:23:33.174
but let's overcome this as one family.

1:23:34.217 --> 1:23:37.804
Boss will be hospitalized tomorrow.

1:23:38.555 --> 1:23:40.390
I ask each of you to provide 10,000 yen.

1:23:44.477 --> 1:23:45.520
Thank you.

1:23:47.355 --> 1:23:48.690
Thank you.

1:23:49.232 --> 1:23:50.442
Thank you.

1:23:56.656 --> 1:23:57.657
Thank you.

1:24:04.539 --> 1:24:06.207
That is all for today.

1:24:07.709 --> 1:24:09.127
Thank you for your time.

1:24:09.210 --> 1:24:11.463
-Brother.
-Yes?

1:24:14.507 --> 1:24:17.469
-Can I have a minute?
-Sure. What is it?

1:24:20.388 --> 1:24:25.310
Could you bring me along
during your work runs?

1:24:36.863 --> 1:24:38.031
Thanks.

1:24:38.782 --> 1:24:39.616
Here.

1:24:52.045 --> 1:24:53.171
Thanks.

1:25:09.938 --> 1:25:11.147
Since when?

1:25:14.275 --> 1:25:19.114
Five years ago.
All of the clubs were raided.

1:25:25.745 --> 1:25:27.997
Does Boss know about this?

1:25:34.879 --> 1:25:36.965
This doesn't make sense.

1:25:38.216 --> 1:25:42.303
You used to say that yakuza
were pursuing the path of real men.

1:25:43.847 --> 1:25:45.849
But now you're dealing drugs.

1:25:45.932 --> 1:25:48.393
That isn't what the yakuza do!

1:25:51.062 --> 1:25:51.896
Shut up!

1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:53.898
What am I supposed to do?

1:25:55.358 --> 1:25:57.902
We have no territory! Everyone quit!

1:25:57.986 --> 1:25:59.237
Boss is sick!

1:26:00.363 --> 1:26:02.448
You know nothing. You just rotted in jail.

1:26:02.532 --> 1:26:03.658
Don't lecture me!

1:26:10.081 --> 1:26:11.499
Pathetic!

1:26:12.292 --> 1:26:13.251
Hey!

1:26:14.127 --> 1:26:17.797
Who do you think I protected
by getting thrown in jail?

1:26:17.881 --> 1:26:20.258
You chose that yourself!

1:26:22.093 --> 1:26:26.347
Then try going to jail yourself!

1:26:27.015 --> 1:26:30.351
You took everything!

1:26:30.435 --> 1:26:31.561
Shut up!

1:26:37.150 --> 1:26:40.778
How could you be put in charge?

1:26:54.626 --> 1:26:55.668
Sorry.

1:27:02.133 --> 1:27:03.051
No.

1:27:05.053 --> 1:27:06.721
I'm sorry.

1:27:19.651 --> 1:27:24.405
We can't earn a living with clean hands.

1:27:38.878 --> 1:27:39.837
Brother…

1:27:42.799 --> 1:27:47.428
You aren't doing the junk, right?

1:27:48.846 --> 1:27:51.099
I haven't fallen that low, moron!

1:28:07.198 --> 1:28:09.951
-Excuse me.
-Take this.

1:28:10.034 --> 1:28:11.160
Okay.

1:28:11.244 --> 1:28:12.370
Excuse me.

1:28:29.137 --> 1:28:30.263
Hello?

1:28:31.055 --> 1:28:34.600
Brother, I found that woman, Yuka.

1:28:41.190 --> 1:28:42.775
I'm sorry for the wait.

1:28:45.611 --> 1:28:49.907
-Do you want to make one?
-Please.

1:28:49.991 --> 1:28:50.992
Just one.

1:28:51.784 --> 1:28:54.537
Let's start with this.

1:28:59.417 --> 1:29:06.424
STAFF ENTRANCE

1:29:27.028 --> 1:29:29.530
You got old, Yamamoto.

1:29:31.324 --> 1:29:32.533
You too, Yuka.

1:29:33.785 --> 1:29:35.119
Of course.

1:29:36.454 --> 1:29:37.622
It's been…

1:29:39.540 --> 1:29:40.792
fourteen years.

1:29:44.253 --> 1:29:47.381
Working at City Hall…
You've really moved up in the world.

1:29:50.343 --> 1:29:52.845
I've always been a hard worker.

1:29:52.929 --> 1:29:54.388
You've got to be joking.

1:29:57.058 --> 1:30:01.145
Did you find yourself a good man?

1:30:05.942 --> 1:30:07.110
No.

1:30:11.614 --> 1:30:12.698
I see.

1:30:20.748 --> 1:30:22.125
Yamamoto,

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:25.753
are you still a yakuza?

1:30:30.675 --> 1:30:31.926
I don't know.

1:30:33.886 --> 1:30:34.929
What does that mean?

1:30:39.392 --> 1:30:44.480
I returned after many years
to find that everything had changed.

1:30:47.608 --> 1:30:50.194
The city, the people…

1:30:57.368 --> 1:30:58.744
Of course.

1:31:04.208 --> 1:31:05.793
Everything had changed.

1:31:23.895 --> 1:31:25.521
-I'm sorry for the wait.
-It's okay.

1:31:26.230 --> 1:31:29.567
Sorry. I wanted to give you this.

1:31:30.902 --> 1:31:32.028
What is it?

1:31:36.991 --> 1:31:38.367
I never used it.

1:31:48.169 --> 1:31:49.295
I don't need it.

1:31:49.378 --> 1:31:50.338
Yamamoto…

1:31:51.672 --> 1:31:53.549
I don't think we should meet anymore.

1:31:56.427 --> 1:31:58.429
Even you are saying that.

1:32:00.681 --> 1:32:03.059
-I'm sorry.
-Yuka.

1:32:05.645 --> 1:32:07.313
Would you come with me?

1:32:10.066 --> 1:32:11.692
I cannot do that.

1:32:11.776 --> 1:32:16.072
You're just one woman. I can support you.

1:32:22.245 --> 1:32:23.496
What is it?

1:32:25.081 --> 1:32:26.165
Sorry.

1:32:27.375 --> 1:32:28.292
Yuka!

1:32:29.335 --> 1:32:31.003
You want to say something.

1:32:31.087 --> 1:32:32.797
What is it? Tell me!

1:32:44.225 --> 1:32:45.434
You can support me?

1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:48.938
Yes.

1:32:50.731 --> 1:32:52.108
Both of us?

1:32:56.195 --> 1:32:57.530
What do you mean?

1:33:03.411 --> 1:33:06.455
Me and my daughter.

1:33:16.674 --> 1:33:19.552
How old…

1:33:21.178 --> 1:33:22.305
is she?

1:33:25.141 --> 1:33:26.309
She's 14.

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:35.151
Hey! Wait a second! She's mine.

1:33:35.234 --> 1:33:36.694
Of course not!

1:33:49.165 --> 1:33:51.125
I can never tell her…

1:33:56.255 --> 1:33:58.049
that her father is a yakuza.

1:34:33.334 --> 1:34:34.668
-Welcome back.
-I'm home.

1:34:35.252 --> 1:34:37.129
-Did you get what you forgot?
-Yes.

1:34:37.213 --> 1:34:38.297
That's good.

1:34:39.340 --> 1:34:42.343
-That smells great.
-Right?

1:34:43.511 --> 1:34:45.346
-It looks good too.
-Right?

1:34:47.181 --> 1:34:48.724
Let me help you.

1:35:06.534 --> 1:35:10.037
I heard about Nakamura.

1:35:12.164 --> 1:35:13.666
Yes.

1:35:16.085 --> 1:35:19.213
Forgive him.

1:35:20.881 --> 1:35:22.258
He's way too serious.

1:35:24.343 --> 1:35:25.344
Yes.

1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:34.478
I'm the most pathetic in all of this.

1:35:38.858 --> 1:35:42.528
I thought about dissolving it.

1:35:44.488 --> 1:35:45.781
The Shibazaki-gumi.

1:35:49.410 --> 1:35:52.621
When I learned that
my cancer metastasized, I considered it.

1:35:55.166 --> 1:35:56.709
But…

1:35:59.378 --> 1:36:03.007
for the guys who can only live as yakuza,

1:36:05.551 --> 1:36:07.970
who would be willing to save them?

1:36:09.722 --> 1:36:10.723
Yes.

1:36:15.352 --> 1:36:19.356
That was my way of thinking.

1:36:22.276 --> 1:36:27.573
But in the end, duty and honor…

1:36:31.285 --> 1:36:33.454
can't beat money.

1:36:33.537 --> 1:36:36.832
No. That isn't true.

1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.544
-Lil Ken.
-Yes?

1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:51.639
Leave the yakuza.

1:37:02.316 --> 1:37:06.987
You still have time to do it over.

1:37:22.711 --> 1:37:25.506
There! One, two, three, four.

1:37:25.589 --> 1:37:26.549
Look at that.

1:38:21.228 --> 1:38:24.148
-You need to hurry up.
-Right.

1:38:24.231 --> 1:38:28.235
You're so slow every day.
What would you do if you were late?

1:39:02.686 --> 1:39:08.609
NOTIFICATION OF EXPULSION
KENJI YAMAMOTO

1:39:22.081 --> 1:39:25.876
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three. Yes.

1:39:26.543 --> 1:39:29.630
There you go. What is this?

1:39:29.713 --> 1:39:32.508
-Boss! He's here.
-What is it?

1:39:33.926 --> 1:39:36.720
Okay. Time to ride the bullet train.

1:39:36.804 --> 1:39:38.597
Depart!

1:39:42.309 --> 1:39:43.310
Oh, my!

1:39:46.188 --> 1:39:47.815
So you're Tsubasa Kimura.

1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:50.109
I am Kato of the Kyoyo-kai.

1:39:51.151 --> 1:39:52.945
-Take a seat.
-Thanks.

1:39:58.117 --> 1:39:59.743
I hear you're doing well.

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:03.288
No, I still have a lot to learn.

1:40:03.372 --> 1:40:05.791
Hey, turn that camera off.

1:40:06.333 --> 1:40:07.751
It's fine.

1:40:08.585 --> 1:40:11.422
Young people these days film everything.

1:40:12.172 --> 1:40:13.757
They're all YouTubers, right?

1:40:13.841 --> 1:40:18.554
We aren't anything like that.
Just in case.

1:40:22.599 --> 1:40:24.351
Really?

1:40:26.979 --> 1:40:30.899
I hear you're hanging around
with the Shibazaki-gumi thugs. I wouldn't.

1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:32.818
They're finished.

1:40:33.694 --> 1:40:34.528
Okay.

1:40:35.738 --> 1:40:39.241
We'll take you in. Okay?
Nothing to worry about then.

1:40:40.576 --> 1:40:41.994
Like it's some honor.

1:40:44.079 --> 1:40:44.913
What?

1:40:46.081 --> 1:40:46.999
Sorry.

1:40:47.583 --> 1:40:50.377
It's okay. We're taking care of ourselves.

1:40:50.461 --> 1:40:52.129
Call us if you run into trouble.

1:40:54.381 --> 1:40:55.215
Hey.

1:40:57.468 --> 1:40:58.427
Brat.

1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:05.768
Do you understand who you're speaking to?

1:41:09.146 --> 1:41:11.064
Turn the camera off!

1:41:11.148 --> 1:41:11.982
Kato.

1:41:13.567 --> 1:41:15.402
We aren't yakuza.

1:41:15.903 --> 1:41:17.905
We don't respond to those threats.

1:41:18.489 --> 1:41:20.657
Listen, brat, punk, thug.

1:41:22.201 --> 1:41:23.952
You shouldn't disrespect grown-ups.

1:41:27.581 --> 1:41:32.085
Your time is over, old man.

1:41:39.802 --> 1:41:40.636
Later.

1:41:42.429 --> 1:41:45.265
You look just like Kimura!

1:41:52.231 --> 1:41:54.316
Hopefully, you don't meet
the same fate as him.

1:41:58.195 --> 1:41:59.446
What does that mean?

1:42:00.197 --> 1:42:01.406
Parental love.

1:42:02.991 --> 1:42:03.909
What?

1:42:11.166 --> 1:42:14.711
Aya! You're going to be late
if you don't hurry up!

1:42:15.295 --> 1:42:16.630
Fine.

1:42:19.508 --> 1:42:21.927
-I'm so tired.
-Good morning.

1:42:23.053 --> 1:42:24.012
Good morning.

1:42:25.055 --> 1:42:25.889
Here.

1:42:27.015 --> 1:42:28.058
-Okay.
-All right.

1:42:28.141 --> 1:42:30.477
-Thank you for this meal.
-Thank you for this meal.

1:42:38.652 --> 1:42:39.653
It's good.

1:42:45.158 --> 1:42:46.326
-Good?
-Yes.

1:42:50.372 --> 1:42:51.748
-I'm off!
-Take care.

1:42:55.794 --> 1:42:56.628
Bye.

1:42:56.712 --> 1:42:58.255
STAFF ENTRANCE

1:43:04.887 --> 1:43:07.055
-Mr. Yamamoto.
-Yes?

1:43:07.806 --> 1:43:11.226
What do you like about Mom?

1:43:13.145 --> 1:43:14.813
Where did that come all of a sudden?

1:43:14.897 --> 1:43:17.232
She's an old lady.

1:43:17.316 --> 1:43:19.234
She has a child in junior high.

1:43:19.318 --> 1:43:21.445
I guess that's true.

1:43:23.030 --> 1:43:27.784
But she used to be much prettier.

1:43:27.868 --> 1:43:29.161
-Really?
-Yes.

1:43:32.331 --> 1:43:34.124
-If you knew her in the past,
-Yes?

1:43:34.958 --> 1:43:36.710
did you ever meet my father?

1:43:39.671 --> 1:43:43.342
No, I never met him.

1:43:45.427 --> 1:43:46.929
-Okay.
-Yes.

1:43:49.556 --> 1:43:52.851
But you know, Mr. Yamamoto,
Mom seems really happy recently.

1:43:52.935 --> 1:43:54.770
-Really?
-She's smiling a lot more.

1:43:55.520 --> 1:43:58.690
I'm old enough now.

1:43:59.900 --> 1:44:01.276
Don't worry about me.

1:44:02.069 --> 1:44:03.737
Just give me pocket money sometimes.

1:44:24.633 --> 1:44:25.968
Yamamoto.

1:44:26.051 --> 1:44:27.511
Carry this outside.

1:44:27.594 --> 1:44:28.637
Okay.

1:44:32.474 --> 1:44:36.019
So you usually can't work for five years.
Most folks would starve.

1:44:36.645 --> 1:44:39.856
I begged the chairman
to make an exception this time.

1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:43.360
It's the first time I was thankful to you.

1:44:43.902 --> 1:44:45.362
What does that mean?

1:44:47.656 --> 1:44:49.282
So yakuza can't make a living now?

1:44:49.908 --> 1:44:50.993
That's all in the past.

1:44:51.076 --> 1:44:53.662
Isn't it cool? Yakuza seem like real men.

1:44:54.162 --> 1:44:56.915
-Are you mocking us?
-Not at all. Sorry.

1:44:56.999 --> 1:44:58.333
You're a good one.

1:44:59.042 --> 1:45:00.252
That's right.

1:45:01.211 --> 1:45:02.921
Please look this way.

1:45:03.005 --> 1:45:04.339
Don't take my picture.

1:45:05.132 --> 1:45:07.092
We should commemorate you getting a job.

1:45:07.175 --> 1:45:08.301
What does that mean?

1:45:10.637 --> 1:45:12.848
-I'll send it to you later.
-Let me see.

1:45:17.060 --> 1:45:18.437
-Send it to me.
-Sure thing.

1:45:25.902 --> 1:45:27.362
Wait a second. I'm not hiding anything.

1:45:27.446 --> 1:45:30.073
-Let me talk to--
-You can talk to me, right?

1:45:30.157 --> 1:45:33.326
You can talk to me, not the girls.
They're scared.

1:45:33.410 --> 1:45:35.662
-Listen now…
-That's not right, is it?

1:45:35.746 --> 1:45:37.664
Let me talk to them even for a little bit.

1:45:38.165 --> 1:45:41.460
What does the organized crime division
want with me?

1:45:41.543 --> 1:45:42.836
You're disturbing business.

1:45:44.046 --> 1:45:47.883
You shouldn't anger adults too much.

1:45:49.885 --> 1:45:52.721
I see how it is.

1:45:54.556 --> 1:45:55.557
Fine.

1:45:56.308 --> 1:45:57.601
Feel free to investigate.

1:45:58.602 --> 1:45:59.603
Unbelievable.

1:46:00.353 --> 1:46:01.480
Detective.

1:46:02.856 --> 1:46:04.566
What kind of person was my father?

1:46:06.526 --> 1:46:08.862
Hajime Kimura. You knew him, right?

1:46:10.405 --> 1:46:13.950
Right. He was a lieutenant
with the Shibazaki-gumi.

1:46:15.410 --> 1:46:17.329
He was just a pathetic thug.

1:46:18.872 --> 1:46:22.125
The guy who killed him
is still in town, right?

1:46:22.959 --> 1:46:23.877
Who knows?

1:46:25.921 --> 1:46:27.756
He must be pretty powerful.

1:46:27.839 --> 1:46:29.174
He can even control the cops.

1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:30.926
I don't know about that.

1:46:32.761 --> 1:46:36.306
If you don't find proper work quickly,
you'll end up like him.

1:46:39.726 --> 1:46:42.020
Who are you lecturing, Osako?

1:46:43.355 --> 1:46:44.272
What?

1:46:47.400 --> 1:46:48.235
Look.

1:46:52.656 --> 1:46:56.076
Everything you did in this town
that you want to keep quiet

1:46:56.159 --> 1:46:57.619
is in our control.

1:46:59.955 --> 1:47:02.874
See? Should I put this online?

1:47:04.417 --> 1:47:06.253
You little brat.

1:47:08.964 --> 1:47:11.883
Tell me about my father.

1:47:17.973 --> 1:47:21.268
Really? Yakuza?

1:47:21.351 --> 1:47:22.978
Good morning.

1:47:29.276 --> 1:47:30.152
Kudo.

1:47:31.069 --> 1:47:33.238
-Can I have a minute?
-Sure.

1:47:41.788 --> 1:47:45.250
We received a notification
about this the other day.

1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:51.590
This Yamamoto was a former
organized crime group member.

1:47:53.300 --> 1:47:55.510
It seems he murdered someone.

1:47:56.428 --> 1:47:59.222
Putting that aside for now.

1:48:00.891 --> 1:48:04.519
There was a curious post.

1:48:07.230 --> 1:48:10.317
Did you see this?

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:11.651
Yakuza, right?

1:48:11.735 --> 1:48:14.738
YUKA KUDO, SECTION 1,
WELFARE DIVISION, TABASAKI CITY HALL

1:48:19.034 --> 1:48:20.035
He was with Aya.

1:48:27.751 --> 1:48:29.502
Stop!

1:48:29.586 --> 1:48:31.671
Do you understand what you did?

1:48:31.755 --> 1:48:33.256
-I'm sorry!
-You!

1:48:33.340 --> 1:48:36.092
I didn't think this would happen!

1:48:36.176 --> 1:48:37.761
It's all your fault!

1:48:37.844 --> 1:48:40.764
My life is finished!

1:48:40.847 --> 1:48:42.641
My entire life is finished!

1:48:44.059 --> 1:48:46.353
-It's finished!
-Hey!

1:48:47.687 --> 1:48:50.440
-Stop!
-Yikes.

1:48:50.523 --> 1:48:52.901
My, my.

1:49:03.119 --> 1:49:05.872
Lil Ken. I heard you left the yakuza.

1:49:07.582 --> 1:49:11.503
You'll still have the yakuza label
for a while.

1:49:12.003 --> 1:49:14.464
You need to live with it somehow.

1:49:22.097 --> 1:49:24.057
Hey! Stop!

1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:26.726
What? Want to get arrested again?

1:49:32.649 --> 1:49:34.901
Don't put this on me.

1:49:37.153 --> 1:49:39.864
You were the ones who stole
my right to live.

1:49:41.449 --> 1:49:45.912
Considering everything you did,

1:49:45.996 --> 1:49:47.664
this is a natural consequence.

1:49:50.542 --> 1:49:52.544
The yakuza lost their human rights

1:49:53.586 --> 1:49:56.298
a long, long time ago.

1:50:05.056 --> 1:50:06.808
WHAT? BUT HIS WIFE WORKS AT CITY HALL…

1:50:06.891 --> 1:50:08.435
If this is true…

1:50:08.518 --> 1:50:09.519
YUKA KUDO IS YAMAMOTO'S LOVER.

1:50:09.602 --> 1:50:14.357
…then we will be unable
to employ you here.

1:50:15.483 --> 1:50:19.154
You would need to leave
the city housing as well.

1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:23.450
This is a lie.

1:50:24.659 --> 1:50:26.536
This isn't true.

1:50:26.619 --> 1:50:29.664
I want to believe you,

1:50:32.584 --> 1:50:36.629
but this has become a huge scandal online.

1:50:40.383 --> 1:50:41.384
Right?

1:51:03.823 --> 1:51:05.617
I called you several times.

1:51:08.620 --> 1:51:09.746
Sorry.

1:51:15.335 --> 1:51:16.419
Where's Aya?

1:51:18.129 --> 1:51:19.255
She hasn't come back.

1:51:26.179 --> 1:51:30.225
Hey, can I ask you one question?

1:51:38.233 --> 1:51:40.193
Why did you want to meet me?

1:51:46.241 --> 1:51:47.117
Answer me!

1:51:52.664 --> 1:51:55.542
Everything was going fine
until you showed up!

1:51:57.085 --> 1:51:58.837
I forgot you!

1:51:59.337 --> 1:52:02.757
I did everything for Aya for 14 years!

1:52:03.425 --> 1:52:07.679
I wish you never came back into our lives!

1:52:08.221 --> 1:52:12.058
It's all your fault!

1:52:16.062 --> 1:52:17.814
It's all your fault.

1:52:25.405 --> 1:52:28.825
I wish I never fell in love with you.

1:52:46.468 --> 1:52:48.136
-Yuka.
-Get out!

1:53:05.236 --> 1:53:06.738
Please.

1:53:11.534 --> 1:53:13.077
Please get out.

1:53:35.808 --> 1:53:36.643
Uncle Ken.

1:53:37.227 --> 1:53:38.228
Yes?

1:53:38.311 --> 1:53:40.813
I'll take care of you if you need me.

1:53:42.524 --> 1:53:48.029
Business has been good recently.
We're opening three bars next month.

1:53:51.241 --> 1:53:52.700
Thank you, Tsubasa.

1:53:54.661 --> 1:53:56.079
I'm fine.

1:53:57.997 --> 1:53:59.290
People who say that

1:53:59.791 --> 1:54:01.626
usually aren't fine at all.

1:54:10.885 --> 1:54:11.719
Uncle Ken.

1:54:14.973 --> 1:54:16.516
The Shibazaki-gumi boss…

1:54:18.518 --> 1:54:20.728
is in a grave condition.

1:54:27.902 --> 1:54:29.946
I know it's not for me to say,

1:54:32.073 --> 1:54:35.243
but don't you want to see him
before he goes?

1:54:37.662 --> 1:54:38.830
Isn't he…

1:54:41.291 --> 1:54:43.209
sort of like family?

1:55:08.902 --> 1:55:10.028
Thanks.

1:55:20.371 --> 1:55:21.247
Uncle Ken.

1:55:22.665 --> 1:55:23.499
What?

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:28.379
I found the guy who killed my old man.

1:55:35.511 --> 1:55:37.889
-Tsubasa.
-Uncle Ken.

1:55:39.599 --> 1:55:40.725
I'm fine.

1:56:00.078 --> 1:56:04.040
Take good care of Aiko.

1:56:43.663 --> 1:56:45.373
-Lil Ken.
-Right.

1:57:26.414 --> 1:57:27.331
Lil Ken.

1:57:30.793 --> 1:57:31.794
Boss.

1:57:40.344 --> 1:57:46.976
You're still calling me "Boss."

1:57:53.024 --> 1:57:54.859
You are…

1:57:59.197 --> 1:58:01.365
the only father I have.

1:58:12.168 --> 1:58:17.340
I never got to act
like a true father to you.

1:58:27.183 --> 1:58:28.392
Lil Ken.

1:58:29.894 --> 1:58:30.812
Yes?

1:58:38.319 --> 1:58:41.697
Take good care of your family.

1:58:51.374 --> 1:58:52.458
I will.

1:59:43.593 --> 1:59:46.429
The person you called
cannot answer at this time.

1:59:46.512 --> 1:59:51.601
Please leave your name
and message after the beep.

1:59:55.354 --> 1:59:56.522
Hello.

1:59:59.275 --> 2:00:00.526
It's me.

2:00:04.614 --> 2:00:07.742
I'm sorry for everything.

2:00:10.953 --> 2:00:12.830
It's my fault this all happened.

2:00:18.127 --> 2:00:20.004
Even though it was brief,

2:00:22.298 --> 2:00:26.469
-I was so happy to be able to live…
-Even if it was just for a short time,

2:00:27.553 --> 2:00:28.804
thank you.

2:00:29.555 --> 2:00:31.641
…like a true family.

2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:49.450
I wanted to be a normal human.

2:00:52.662 --> 2:00:55.248
I wanted to live a normal life.

2:00:57.917 --> 2:01:03.172
I wanted to work hard
and become a proper human being.

2:01:04.632 --> 2:01:07.426
I didn't care if that life was boring.

2:01:09.887 --> 2:01:12.723
I wanted us to have fun on our days off.

2:01:14.892 --> 2:01:17.019
That is the kind of life I wanted.

2:01:18.396 --> 2:01:19.522
I'm back.

2:01:34.745 --> 2:01:40.668
For 14 years,
I constantly thought about you.

2:01:46.173 --> 2:01:49.093
When I found out we had a child,

2:01:50.761 --> 2:01:52.680
I wanted to throw everything aside

2:01:54.432 --> 2:01:57.018
to protect you.

2:02:01.939 --> 2:02:05.818
But my presence in your lives

2:02:07.236 --> 2:02:09.280
hurt you both deeply.

2:02:10.448 --> 2:02:11.407
No!

2:02:11.490 --> 2:02:14.327
I am truly sorry.

2:02:17.121 --> 2:02:18.372
Boss!

2:02:20.708 --> 2:02:21.542
Boss!

2:02:38.100 --> 2:02:39.685
Get him!

2:02:39.769 --> 2:02:40.811
Let go of me!

2:02:43.397 --> 2:02:44.774
Get him!

2:02:47.651 --> 2:02:49.570
Stop struggling!

2:02:51.197 --> 2:02:52.239
Stop struggling!

2:03:12.718 --> 2:03:16.806
Yuka, I want to see you again.

2:03:19.642 --> 2:03:21.477
I want to see you and Aya.

2:03:24.605 --> 2:03:29.151
Lastly, thank you for giving birth to Aya.

2:03:32.363 --> 2:03:33.656
I love you.

2:05:10.044 --> 2:05:11.420
It's your fault.

2:05:16.884 --> 2:05:19.428
If you hadn't come back…

2:05:23.557 --> 2:05:24.725
Burn in hell.

2:05:27.686 --> 2:05:30.731
Burn in hell, Brother.

2:05:46.914 --> 2:05:48.123
Hosono.

2:05:55.256 --> 2:05:56.507
I'm sorry.

2:08:23.862 --> 2:08:24.863
Are you a yakuza?

2:08:28.742 --> 2:08:29.910
No.

2:08:33.455 --> 2:08:35.833
No one can survive
as a yakuza in this world.

2:08:39.920 --> 2:08:40.838
Hey.

2:08:42.756 --> 2:08:43.590
What?

2:08:47.970 --> 2:08:50.889
What kind of person was my father?

2:09:39.980 --> 2:09:41.023
Okay.

2:09:46.153 --> 2:09:49.740
Let's talk for a bit.

2:15:33.041 --> 2:15:38.046
