     <i> Call the authorities</i>
         <i> immediately.</i>

21:35.369 --> 21:37.520
         (line ringing)

21:37.522 --> 21:39.355
          <i> (recorded):</i>
   <i> You've reached Dr. Bell.</i>

21:39.357 --> 21:40.798
      <i> Leave a message.</i>
<i> I'll get back to you shortly.</i>

21:40.800 --> 21:43.634
            <i> -(beep)</i>
-Randolph, you'll probably think
         this is silly,

21:43.636 --> 21:45.803
           but I know
   you picked up a hitchhiker

21:45.805 --> 21:48.881
 and I just saw something on TV
   that made me a bit worried.

21:48.883 --> 21:52.101
   So... call me back, okay?

21:56.557 --> 21:58.816
You all presented with a similar
   constellation of symptoms.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.059
        Abdominal pain.

22:00.061 --> 22:01.560
         Abnormal EKGs.
       Elevated potassium.

22:01.562 --> 22:02.728
        Hallucinations.

22:02.730 --> 22:04.229
 Your friend Holly said she saw

22:04.231 --> 22:06.065
     a halo above my head.

22:06.067 --> 22:07.491
       Do you see it, too?

22:07.493 --> 22:08.642
      And he has one, too.

22:08.644 --> 22:10.719
  Does everything look yellow?

22:10.721 --> 22:13.222
           -Yes. Very.
          -Xanthopsia.

22:13.224 --> 22:15.333
  Uncommon visual side effect
          of digoxin.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.560
    Well, that would explain
           everything.

22:17.562 --> 22:20.079
       But are you taking
        heart medication?

22:20.081 --> 22:22.322
    I've never had a problem
         with my heart.

22:22.324 --> 22:24.157
   At least as far as I know.

22:24.159 --> 22:26.418
        Yeah, the others
    aren't taking it either.

22:26.420 --> 22:28.995
       What plant is used
        to make digoxin?

22:28.997 --> 22:31.665
     Highly toxic foxglove.

22:32.668 --> 22:35.594
        Is there anyone
 who would want to poison you?

22:35.596 --> 22:37.021
       A, uh, rival witch

22:37.023 --> 22:39.248
       -or coven, perhaps?
             -Uh...

22:39.250 --> 22:41.525
    -I don't think so. Uh...
             -Well,

22:41.527 --> 22:43.844
   we'll get you the antidote
           to digoxin,

22:43.846 --> 22:45.529
        see if it helps.

22:48.943 --> 22:50.092
             MIKE:
             Okay.

22:50.094 --> 22:52.261
 You don't have to answer this,

22:52.263 --> 22:53.596
            but...
           (exhales)

22:53.598 --> 22:55.355
     I've always wondered--

22:55.357 --> 22:57.249
what's it like to be a surgeon?

22:59.027 --> 23:02.046
     I mean, the-the knife.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.939
 Cutting into the human flesh.

23:03.941 --> 23:04.882
    I mean, that must be...

23:04.884 --> 23:06.759
       It's intoxicating.

23:07.887 --> 23:12.890
 That's-that's not something I
would normally tell a stranger.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.284
           But I...
           (exhales)

23:15.286 --> 23:16.710
       Yeah, I don't think
         a hit of heroin

23:16.712 --> 23:19.063
      could hold a candle
  to the euphoria that I feel

23:19.065 --> 23:20.639
     when I have a scalpel
          in my hand.

23:20.641 --> 23:22.791
           That's...
           (inhales)

23:22.793 --> 23:24.193
           I'll bet.

23:25.129 --> 23:26.386
         All right. Mm.

23:26.388 --> 23:29.240
 This may be crossing the line.
           (chuckles)

23:29.242 --> 23:30.741
             Uh...

23:31.911 --> 23:33.536
    You ever killed anybody?

23:35.489 --> 23:37.230
        Mistakes happen

23:37.232 --> 23:39.141
  -in the OR. That's-that's...
             -Yeah.

23:39.143 --> 23:40.400
That's part of being a surgeon.

23:40.402 --> 23:41.326
        Sure. Of course.

23:41.328 --> 23:42.903
     But what I mean is...
           (inhales)

23:42.905 --> 23:46.924
 have you ever done something
 where y-you knew it was wrong

23:46.926 --> 23:48.634
     but you did it anyway?

23:51.989 --> 23:52.930
         (Bell exhales)

23:52.932 --> 23:54.080
    Oh, I see I hit a nerve.

23:54.082 --> 23:56.675
        No. You didn't.

23:56.677 --> 23:57.726
              Oh.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.605
    Whatever you say, boss.
       (chuckles softly)

24:05.427 --> 24:09.613
            Well, uh,
  if you make a left up there,

24:09.615 --> 24:13.284
I'm just about, uh, five minutes
         down that road.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.578
 If it's not too much trouble.

24:16.197 --> 24:18.581
       (insects trilling)

24:21.852 --> 24:23.627
        (steady beeping)

24:24.371 --> 24:27.280
 I heard the patient is Wiccan.

24:28.209 --> 24:30.192
     She came into the ER
    with two other witches.

24:30.194 --> 24:33.545
    Really think they believe
in spells and potions and stuff?

24:33.547 --> 24:36.140
     I think people believe
 in whatever gives them comfort

24:36.142 --> 24:38.142
         in this world.
            (inhales)

24:38.144 --> 24:40.478
    And I'm okay with that.

24:41.296 --> 24:44.064
 What do you think, Dr. Sutton?

24:48.212 --> 24:49.636
     Right after Nic died,

24:49.638 --> 24:52.156
         I bought a copy
               of
 <i> The Tibetan Book of the Dead.</i>

24:52.158 --> 24:54.325
Read it every night for a week.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.994
      In Tibetan Buddhism,
          when you die,

24:56.996 --> 24:59.663
   your soul spends 49 days
   in the Bardo... (inhales)

24:59.665 --> 25:02.666
     the place in between
   life and death. (exhales)

25:02.668 --> 25:04.727
         After 49 days,

25:04.729 --> 25:07.171
you're reborn into another body.

25:08.323 --> 25:10.591
    I want that to be true.

25:14.088 --> 25:17.598
            (exhales)
       I miss her so much.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.685
           (shudders)

25:21.687 --> 25:23.646
            (sighs)

25:24.506 --> 25:26.565
         Let's do this.

25:28.010 --> 25:30.194
       (crickets chirping)

25:31.531 --> 25:33.939
              MIKE:
       This-this is good.
     You can-- you can stop

25:33.941 --> 25:35.348
          right here.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.683
     This is in the middle
          of nowhere.

25:36.685 --> 25:37.851
 There's not a house in sight.

25:37.853 --> 25:38.927
      Well, I know my way.

25:38.929 --> 25:40.095
             Okay.

25:40.097 --> 25:41.430
        -If you say so.
        -Mm. (exhales)

25:41.432 --> 25:44.416
     Well, it's been good
   traveling with you, Mike.

25:48.956 --> 25:51.090
       Is there a problem?

25:52.459 --> 25:56.536
     Well, I think I have
 to raise that question again,

25:56.538 --> 25:57.629
           about...

25:57.631 --> 25:59.948
         killing people
   and doing the right thing.

25:59.950 --> 26:02.375
 Because I can't help but feel
    like you have something

26:02.377 --> 26:03.894
      that you really have
     to get off your chest.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.637
     Okay, I really don't.
    And I'm not comfortable

26:05.639 --> 26:07.790
          -with this.
  -Dr. Bell, we were building
        a relationship.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.141
       -I need to get back
         on the highway.
        -We were bonding.

26:09.143 --> 26:10.568
  Get out of the car. Please.

26:10.570 --> 26:13.128
    -I feel like we are cut
     from the same cloth.
             -I...

26:13.130 --> 26:15.130
    I barely know you, Mike.

26:15.132 --> 26:16.481
    -I-I just picked you up.
           -(chuckles)

26:16.483 --> 26:19.484
   Okay, that's a good point.
        We are strangers.

26:19.486 --> 26:20.636
           (chuckles)

26:20.638 --> 26:23.747
       But I'm really good
       at reading people.

26:25.567 --> 26:27.067
    And I see things in you.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.494
            -(sighs)
      -You've hurt people.

26:29.496 --> 26:31.213
       You've taken lives.

26:34.001 --> 26:37.094
            (exhales)
     If you keep secrets...

26:37.096 --> 26:39.597
      they become burdens.

26:45.846 --> 26:48.513
      'Kay, you're making--
 you're making a mistake, Mike.

26:48.515 --> 26:49.589
Well, you're-you're lying to me.

26:49.591 --> 26:52.592
           -(shudders)
    -And you know how I feel

26:52.594 --> 26:54.336
       about dishonesty.

26:54.338 --> 26:55.762
             So...

26:55.764 --> 26:58.282
       -(chuckles softly)
   you should tell the truth.
            -(grunts)

26:58.284 --> 27:02.102
    I think that it would be
       very good for you.

27:02.104 --> 27:03.528
           (exhales)

27:03.530 --> 27:06.014
       (stammers, sighs)

27:06.016 --> 27:08.959
 There was a-a time when, um...

27:10.129 --> 27:13.297
       ...out of hubris,

27:13.299 --> 27:15.758
           I operated
     when I shouldn't have.

27:17.361 --> 27:19.303
I had-- I had a physical problem

27:19.305 --> 27:21.305
   that meant I shouldn't...

27:21.307 --> 27:23.824
    hold a blade in my hand.

27:23.826 --> 27:24.992
           (inhales)

27:24.994 --> 27:26.626
          And I, um...
            (exhales)

27:26.628 --> 27:27.870
        (grunts softly)

27:27.872 --> 27:29.963
          And I thought
       I could control it.

27:29.965 --> 27:32.524
   Did you really think that?

27:36.063 --> 27:38.230
    No. I knew I was a risk.

27:38.232 --> 27:40.065
              Mm.

27:40.067 --> 27:41.533
        (exhales softly)

27:42.310 --> 27:44.745
    And you killed somebody.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.740
 -In a simple operation that...
              -Mm.

27:49.576 --> 27:51.669
 -...shouldn't have been risky.
            -(sighs)

27:51.671 --> 27:53.754
   And the man bled to death.

27:54.823 --> 27:57.091
 And what was your punishment?

28:01.514 --> 28:02.846
        There was none.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.431
              Mm.

28:07.169 --> 28:09.761
     Because the white coat
          is a shield.

28:09.763 --> 28:11.096
           (shudders)

28:11.098 --> 28:12.672
          -(exhales)
   -So you got away with it.

28:13.359 --> 28:16.610
 No, I didn't get away with it.

28:19.106 --> 28:21.273
      That death haunts me
          to this day,

28:21.275 --> 28:22.774
  and I live with that guilt.

28:22.776 --> 28:25.018
Ooh, guilt means nothing to me.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.495
       Guilt is pointless.

28:28.766 --> 28:30.374
           (exhales)

28:31.268 --> 28:34.044
        There's a saying
       in my line of work.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.964
It's one that all surgeons know.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.635
 "Killing someone is so easy."

28:45.282 --> 28:47.599
          "What's hard
    is not killing someone."

28:48.394 --> 28:50.561
               ♪

28:55.459 --> 28:57.401
           (exhales)

28:58.738 --> 29:01.463
            Well...

29:01.465 --> 29:03.115
        it is a pleasure

29:03.117 --> 29:06.059
   to make your acquaintance,
            Dr. Bell.

29:06.061 --> 29:07.411
           (inhales)

29:07.413 --> 29:09.163
           (exhales)

29:09.915 --> 29:11.665
          Drive safe.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.918
       (insects trilling)

29:14.920 --> 29:17.171
   (bird hooting in distance)

29:23.153 --> 29:24.987
       (gearshift clicks)

29:24.989 --> 29:26.597
         (engine revs)

29:32.420 --> 29:34.563
  (monitors beeping steadily)

29:35.833 --> 29:37.274
       Another life saved.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.259
  I can't take all the glory.

29:39.261 --> 29:41.019
 His ghost gets partial credit.

29:41.021 --> 29:42.428
       Pericardial patch.

29:42.430 --> 29:44.072
         Sutures to me.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.192
   Should we enroll the ghost
         in med school?

29:47.194 --> 29:49.453
    Ah, you joke, Dr. Devi.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.696
         But that spirit
       scared Ethan enough

29:51.698 --> 29:52.956
 to bring him to this hospital,

29:52.958 --> 29:55.459
       where we unmasked
   a life-threatening tumor.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.796
       (chuckles softly)
     Ghosts get a bad rep.

29:58.798 --> 30:00.205
     Some are vicious, yes,

30:00.207 --> 30:03.300
   but others are guardians.

30:03.302 --> 30:07.620
           And some
  are just restless memories.

30:07.622 --> 30:11.624
    One thing they all have
in common is they freak me out.

30:11.626 --> 30:15.229
      With all due respect,
 I just like them to stay dead.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.132
       Holly's doing well.

30:19.134 --> 30:21.059
 She's recovering from surgery.

30:21.061 --> 30:22.894
       Oh, such a relief.

     Oh, how are you doing?

30:25.991 --> 30:28.050

        High Priestess?
    -That's what I'm trying

          to find out.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.555

         this morning,

30:33.557 --> 30:36.224
         do you remember
       what you put in it?

30:36.226 --> 30:37.501
         Um, hibiscus,

30:37.503 --> 30:40.504
       blackberry leaves,
       peppermint petals,

30:40.506 --> 30:41.672
      foxglove and some...

30:41.674 --> 30:43.915
   So you added the foxglove?

30:43.917 --> 30:46.326
        Was that wrong?

30:46.328 --> 30:47.903

               Oh.

           (chuckles)

30:49.164 --> 30:51.014

         -I did this.

30:51.016 --> 30:52.332
      It's not your fault.

30:52.334 --> 30:54.125
       I should have kept
       that jar separate.

30:54.127 --> 30:55.760
         -I am so sorry.
      -No, no, no, no, no.

30:55.762 --> 30:57.762

           It's okay.

        <i> -I keep saying</i>

       we went there a lot

31:17.284 --> 31:18.600
 -when we first started dating.
              -Oh.

31:18.602 --> 31:20.544
  I knew you looked familiar.
           I just...

31:20.546 --> 31:21.962
       couldn't place you.

31:24.866 --> 31:26.091
    And I remember your son.

31:29.463 --> 31:33.115

           this year.

31:33.117 --> 31:35.634
            Joseph.
       (chuckles softly)

31:35.636 --> 31:37.060
           So sorry.

31:38.898 --> 31:41.064

31:41.883 --> 31:44.359
     You lost her recently?

31:46.221 --> 31:49.481
   I sensed something. Um...

31:49.483 --> 31:51.566
      I feel these things.

31:52.636 --> 31:55.061
Also, I asked that lovely nurse,
            Hundley.

31:55.063 --> 31:57.122
           (chuckles)

31:58.992 --> 32:01.493
       She died suddenly.

32:01.495 --> 32:03.754
    My whole world stopped.

32:03.756 --> 32:09.426
     I feel like I'm living
in some kind of alternate space.

32:10.504 --> 32:12.596
      Nothing makes sense.

32:17.585 --> 32:19.494
     But I have a daughter.

32:19.496 --> 32:20.753
       (chuckles softly)

32:20.755 --> 32:22.064

32:24.777 --> 32:26.276
       She keeps me going.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.445
    And I have to keep going
            for her.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.366

32:33.435 --> 32:35.677

32:38.123 --> 32:40.082

But I do dream about her and...

32:46.707 --> 32:50.450
           (shudders)
        feels very real.

32:50.452 --> 32:53.178

            (gulps)

32:59.144 --> 33:00.960

33:00.962 --> 33:02.479
              Mm.

33:06.134 --> 33:08.468
          Actually...

33:08.470 --> 33:10.487
        she's with you.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.115
       She always will be.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.994

39:29.609 --> 39:31.368
   Say good night, everybody.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.703
          -Good night.
              -Bye.
          -(smooching)

39:33.705 --> 39:35.597
          -Good night.
        -Love you, GiGi.

39:35.599 --> 39:38.124
       Let's go upstairs.

39:39.769 --> 39:41.527
       -Smells delicious.
           -Thai food.

39:41.529 --> 39:42.604
        Nic's favorite.

39:42.606 --> 39:45.197
          All right.
   Everyone take your seats.

39:45.199 --> 39:47.384
 -This is all very mysterious.
          -(chuckles)

39:47.386 --> 39:51.796
  I... learned about something
     today from my patient.

39:51.798 --> 39:53.890
          Something...

39:53.892 --> 39:56.041
        pretty special.

39:56.043 --> 39:57.710
 It's a ritual that helps her,

39:57.712 --> 40:00.304
 and I think it might help us.

40:00.306 --> 40:02.214
   It's called a dumb supper.

40:02.216 --> 40:03.641
     "Dumb" as in "silent."
            (grunts)

40:04.628 --> 40:07.295
 Which I realize won't be easy
       for some of you.

40:07.297 --> 40:08.963
          -(chuckling)
             -Yeah.

40:08.965 --> 40:11.149
       Good, good, good.
           (inhales)

40:11.151 --> 40:13.225
   Uh, it's a pagan ritual--
          thank you--

40:13.227 --> 40:15.495
   to honor those we've lost.

40:16.397 --> 40:17.822
It's really just a chance for us

40:17.824 --> 40:20.232
       to quietly reflect
        on our memories,

40:20.234 --> 40:22.752
   in silence, among friends.

40:22.754 --> 40:23.920
           (shudders)

40:23.922 --> 40:25.480
     Magdalena told me that

40:25.482 --> 40:27.999
 on Samhain, which is tonight,

40:28.001 --> 40:31.386
that the veil between the living
and the dead is at its thinnest.

40:32.822 --> 40:36.599
   So if you have something
   you want to say to Nic...

40:36.601 --> 40:39.394
      ("Naked As We Came"
    by Iron & Wine playing)

40:40.997 --> 40:43.481
    ...we close our eyes...

40:44.759 --> 40:47.026
...and you speak without words.

40:48.855 --> 40:51.072
     Speak from your heart.

40:52.008 --> 40:54.242
