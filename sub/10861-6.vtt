WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:05.360
Oh!

00:05.360 --> 00:07.680
Aaaahhh! 
 Gary, are you OK?

00:08.480 --> 00:10.640
- Gotcha. 
 - You toad.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.680
GARY: 
 I love that trick.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.280
Yeah, well, you're one 
 sick little puppy, you know that?

00:16.880 --> 00:19.280
So you're dad really owns this place?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.240
Yeah. It's where I get 
 all my story ideas.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.040
There's all sorts of strange, 
 voodoo, and occult stuff in here.

00:24.040 --> 00:29.200
About your stories, Gary-- 
 I shouldn't be telling you this,

00:29.200 --> 00:32.000
but, well... some of 
 the guys have been saying

00:32.000 --> 00:33.720
that they haven't 
 been too scary lately.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.520
Who said that?

00:35.520 --> 00:37.200
I don't know.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.960
What are these?

00:38.960 --> 00:42.120
Super specs. 
 They give you x-ray vision.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.640
- Whoa, yowza! 
 - Give me a break.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.360
What's the matter, 
 you don't believe in magic?

00:47.360 --> 00:50.720
- Oh, and you do? 
 - Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.840
Sometimes it's best 
 to keep an open mind,

00:52.840 --> 00:55.400
and be ready for surprises.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:05.680 --> 01:08.640
Yeah, well, if you ask me, 
 I think he's slipping big time.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.400
No way. 
 Gary tells the best stories.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.080
- No, not yet. 
 - Frank's right.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.400
I can't remember the last time 
 Gary really scared me.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.800
- Geez, you scared me! 
 - Sorry, I'm late.

01:27.800 --> 01:32.000
David can't make it tonight. 
 He's, uh-- sick.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.960
That's OK. 
 Kiki was just saying

01:34.960 --> 01:37.320
how your stories haven't 
 been too scary lately anyway.

01:37.320 --> 01:40.560
- I'm gonna smack you. 
 - Not scary, huh?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.400
Well, why don't 
 you give me a shot tonight?

01:42.400 --> 01:45.800
- I'll see what I can do. 
 - You're the boss.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.720
The story I've got is 
 about 3 kinds of people.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.800
People who believe in magic...

01:53.200 --> 01:54.480
people who don't...

01:56.560 --> 01:58.840
and people who should.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.480
Submitted for the approval 
 of the Midnight Society,

02:03.480 --> 02:05.400
I call this story...

02:21.560 --> 02:25.320
Weeds was into magic 
 and tricks in a big way.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.200
And since April Fool's Day 
 was coming up,

02:27.200 --> 02:29.120
he had to get ready.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.680
The dust of dendaron.

02:33.680 --> 02:37.200
Powdered monkey bones, 
 crucial to every witch's spell.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.000
I thought we were 
 going to the movies.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.720
Later, later, I'm casting a spell.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.160
- Oh, sorry. 
 - Let's see.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.000
Oh, here it is.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.560
"The spell of the second sight."

02:52.040 --> 02:57.520
"Umbu tubu... sunra day...

03:00.040 --> 03:03.800
visu rulu bambanay!"

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
Ooh!

03:06.880 --> 03:08.400
What are you doing?

03:08.400 --> 03:10.320
I don't know. 
 It's just some kind of voodoo spell.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.520
Weeds.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.200
We've been seeing 
 each other for what?

03:13.200 --> 03:16.280
- Like a long time now, right. 
 - Yeah, 2 weeks.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.160
I'm beginning to think 
 that you're not very...

03:19.160 --> 03:21.600
- mature. 
 - What makes you say that?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.280
[sound of passing gas]

03:26.040 --> 03:28.120
Oh, this is good.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.280
You are so gross. 
 Can we go now?

03:34.160 --> 03:36.480
Come, come. 
 Play time's over.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.760
Buy now, or bye, now.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.160
OK, Mr. Sardo, I'll take...

03:42.160 --> 03:46.840
It's Sar-Do. No mister. 
 Accent on the "Do".

03:48.400 --> 03:49.640
Yeah.

03:49.640 --> 03:51.520
Look, I'll take these 
 and the monkey bones, too.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.840
Oh.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.040
April Fool's Day tomorrow. 
 He's gotta stock up.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.600
- Oh. 
 - [annoying siren sound]

03:57.600 --> 04:00.920
Yes-- very nice.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.800
Uh-- have you seen our vomit?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.400
Hey, hey, what are these?

04:06.400 --> 04:09.560
Ah! You have a sharp eye.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.440
I've sold hundreds, 
 and, uh-- thousands of those.

04:13.440 --> 04:17.959
- What do they do? 
 - Some say they give you x-ray vision.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.840
- Yowza! 
 - Give me a break.

04:22.840 --> 04:26.120
- I'll take these, too. 
 - I'll ring you up.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.400
Come on, try them on. 
 They're a goof.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.000
I wouldn't wear 
 those to my funeral.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.560
Come on, M.B., lighten up. 
 Put them on, they're cool.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.120
Cool?

04:38.320 --> 04:42.280
- Well, do you see anything? 
 - No, it's stupid.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.280
- What was that? 
 - What was what?

04:58.440 --> 05:02.920
Look, um-- I think Mr. Sardo 
 has got you a little wacko.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.600
Trans rama su.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.760
- Hi. 
 - What's the matter, Weeds,

05:59.760 --> 06:02.080
haven't pulled any April Fool's 
 stunts on us yet.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.960
- Oh, that's stupid kid stuff. 
 - Yeah, but you're a stupid kid.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.240
What are you looking at?

06:12.240 --> 06:16.120
Man, I knew 
 it was going to be a rip-off.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.440
What's with him?

06:17.440 --> 06:21.560
[in a high voice] 
 Who knows? He's always...

06:21.560 --> 06:23.800
My voice, 
 what's wrong with my voice?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.840
I sound like a chipmunk!

06:41.880 --> 06:43.520
Whoa!

06:44.560 --> 06:45.880
April Fool's!

06:45.880 --> 06:47.680
Oh, man, 
 you should've seen your face.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.360
Great, thanks.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.240
- What are those? 
 - Don't you know?

06:52.240 --> 06:56.240
These are magic glasses 
 that make you look cool.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.840
Don't I look cool, 
 or do I just look like, uh...

06:58.840 --> 07:01.000
What's the matter?

07:04.600 --> 07:08.000
I saw somebody, 
 a strange woman.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.880
Yeah, April Fool's. 
 April Fool's.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.160
[school bells rings]

07:28.360 --> 07:30.080
I'm not kidding. 
 I saw somebody.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.680
M.B., look, I give up. 
 No more magic, OK?

07:34.960 --> 07:36.280
You don't believe me.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.720
Oh, come on, M.B., 
 what do you take me for,

07:37.720 --> 07:39.680
some kind of doofus?

07:39.680 --> 07:43.080
- Don't even answer that. 
 - Look, I'm not lying!

07:43.080 --> 07:45.680
Every time I put these 
 stupid specs on, I see...

07:48.880 --> 07:50.840
She's there. 
 Look by the tree.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.160
Look, this is getting 
 really old, M.B.

08:05.160 --> 08:07.040
You don't see her?!

08:10.280 --> 08:12.680
Aaaahhh!

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Hey!

08:21.240 --> 08:23.520
Yes! 
 H-O-R-S, sucker.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.920
Miss this, and you're done.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.600
Raja om gala.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.360
Say what?

08:39.360 --> 08:42.120
Look, this is all net this time. 
 OK, baby?

08:42.120 --> 08:44.720
This one is going in.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.280
Air ball! My game.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.120
- I hate this game. 
 - That's 2 sodas, dude.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.520
- You owe me 2. 
 - Yeah, yeah.

09:04.680 --> 09:06.560
Naaah. Naaah.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.040
So, I came out of the school,

09:09.040 --> 09:10.760
put on the glasses, 
 and she was there by the tree.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.800
So she just stood there 
 staring at me,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.120
- and then she like pointed at me. 
 - Who was it?

09:15.120 --> 09:16.720
I don't know.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.760
Maybe it's some kind of 
 stupid trick Weeds is playing.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.120
The guy's strange.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.720
Know what he bought me 
 for our one week anniversary?

09:21.720 --> 09:22.720
What?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.320
Some stupid book 
 on mummies or something.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.640
I've got it right...

09:25.640 --> 09:27.680
What's the matter?

09:28.200 --> 09:31.160
- I thought you threw them away. 
 - I did!

09:53.040 --> 09:54.880
Anybody home?

11:24.520 --> 11:26.080
Whoa.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.480
Oh, man!

12:45.680 --> 12:47.720
Who are you?!

12:49.800 --> 12:51.920
Aaaahhhh!

13:13.720 --> 13:15.200
Aaahhh!

13:17.600 --> 13:19.520
Man, she should've 
 burn those specs,

13:19.520 --> 13:21.200
or chucked 'em in 
 the garbage disposal.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.400
But the apparitions 
 weren't really there.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.840
- Or were they? 
 - She didn't know.

13:26.840 --> 13:31.560
All Marybeth knew was she could 
 only see them through the specs.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.600
- So what did she do? 
 - The only think she could think of.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.560
She went looking for Weeds. 
 Maybe he knew what was going on.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.000
Weeds!

13:39.000 --> 13:41.080
Weeds, the specs! 
 I swear I'm seeing things!

13:41.080 --> 13:43.000
- They're ghosts! 
 - Whoa! Slow down!

13:43.000 --> 13:46.520
- What's the matter? 
 - Whenever I put these specs on, I see...

13:58.560 --> 14:00.360
Aaaahhhh!

14:03.640 --> 14:06.720
Marybeth! 
 What is her problem?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.920
Mr. Sardo! 
 Mr. Sardo, open up!

14:15.920 --> 14:18.120
Come on, Mr. Sardo!

14:19.320 --> 14:23.360
That's Sar-Do. No mister. 
 Accent on the "Do".

14:23.360 --> 14:25.360
Mr. Sardo, 
 I need to speak to you.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.160
I'm all out of vomit. 
 Try me Tuesday.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.840
No, it's the specs 
 my boyfriend bought.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.280
Sorry, no guarantees.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.640
If they don't work, 
 that's your nevermind.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.000
No, wait. 
 My problem is they do work.

14:37.640 --> 14:39.560
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.440
Uh-- scourge. 
 Um-- pestilence.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.640
Plague.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.000
Here it is! Here it is.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.120
The spell of second sight.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.080
That's it, 
 that's the spell Weeds did.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.560
It's gotta be what's 
 making this happen.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.920
- It is? 
 - Yeah-- yes, it is.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.960
- Of course. 
 - Am I like, seeing ghosts or something?

14:55.960 --> 14:59.280
Ghosts? 
 No, no, no, no.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.880
Um-- what you're seeing is, uh...

15:01.880 --> 15:06.120
another dimension. 
 That's the second sight.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.240
- Another dimension? 
 - Exactly.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.360
You see, there are...

15:11.360 --> 15:14.400
There are beings all around us, 
 all the time,

15:14.400 --> 15:21.440
that we can't see because 
 they're in another dimension.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.280
- That's really creepy. 
 - Mmm.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.600
The, uh-- the spell must've 
 opened up a window,

15:27.600 --> 15:33.040
probably at your house, 
 and those specs allow you to see

15:33.040 --> 15:37.000
into a paralled universe.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.320
I've got a parallel 
 universe in my house.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.880
Mmm, apparently.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.440
And, um...

15:42.440 --> 15:45.040
once the window is open,

15:45.040 --> 15:50.760
the beings can cross over 
 into our dimension.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.400
And, uh-- well...

15:53.400 --> 15:58.760
I don't mean to scare you... 
 but they could take over.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.800
Very, very dangerous. 
 Very dangerous.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.440
So let's just go over to my house 
 and close the window.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.240
Yes, well you see, 
 casting a spell is easy.

16:10.240 --> 16:13.320
Uncasting can be tricky.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.320
You need, um-- an expert.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.440
Someone who is familiar 
 with the counter spells,

16:19.440 --> 16:22.280
and how to cast them.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.560
- Do you know the counter spells? 
 - Ha, naturally.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.880
But I have expenses.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.640
What'll it cost?

16:31.480 --> 16:33.480
- $50? 
 - What?

16:33.480 --> 16:36.240
All right, $20. 
 But I'm losing on the deal.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.840
- OK, I guess. 
 - Good, good, good, good.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.600
Now then, let's see, let's see.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.000
Um-- um, where's the...

16:43.000 --> 16:45.560
- Uh-oh. 
 - What?

16:45.560 --> 16:48.400
Uh-- the Dust-- 
 the Dust of Dendaron.

16:48.400 --> 16:50.600
I, uh-- I'm not.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.240
I-- I had some here.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.480
I must have sold 
 the last pouch to...

16:55.480 --> 16:58.000
To your boyfriend.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.440
Dust of Dendaron, 
 you big rip-off.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.440
Prepare for a burial at sea.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.040
[sound of toliet flushing]

17:07.040 --> 17:09.280
- Adios, monkey bones. 
 - Stop!

17:09.280 --> 17:11.640
You flush this dust, 
 and you're going in after it.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.319
Alla... kazam.

17:17.119 --> 17:21.599
Alla... kazam!

17:21.599 --> 17:25.760
Alla... kazam!

17:25.760 --> 17:27.440
Alla kazam in a crystal ball?

17:27.440 --> 17:29.360
Come on, who does 
 he think he's kidding?

17:29.360 --> 17:32.520
Can we like, get this done 
 before my parents come home?

17:32.520 --> 17:34.040
Shhh!

17:34.040 --> 17:36.480
I need to concentrate.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.120
I thought you didn't 
 believe in this stuff, Martybeth.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.560
The window.

17:45.560 --> 17:49.440
The window into another dimension.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.360
We must close the window.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.440
Oh, brother.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.640
Sunra day...

18:00.160 --> 18:01.720
vinsu rulu...

18:04.600 --> 18:07.680
bamba nay.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.440
- That's the same spell! 
 - Shhhh!

18:13.040 --> 18:14.480
Bamba nay...

18:17.800 --> 18:21.440
We must close the window.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.000
Send them back.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.800
Don't you need the dust?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.520
Oh, right. 
 Yes, yes, the dust.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.440
It doesn't work. Trust me.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.760
Bamba nay.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.360
Bamba nay.

18:39.320 --> 18:42.160
I'm very, very embarrassed 
 for this guy.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.360
[strange sound]

18:45.360 --> 18:47.200
Listen. What's that?

18:47.920 --> 18:51.080
- I'm not doing that. 
 - No?

18:51.080 --> 18:53.160
M.B.?

18:53.160 --> 18:54.560
Is this for real?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.760
- What's going on? 
 - I don't know.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.720
- I've never done this before. 
 - I thought you were the expert!

18:59.720 --> 19:01.840
Do something.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.360
The specs.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.480
Put on the specs 
 and tell us what you see.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.520
Nooo!

19:14.760 --> 19:17.880
M.B.? Marybeth.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.280
They're here! 
 I can see them!

19:19.280 --> 19:22.160
Take off-- 
 take off the specs.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.760
- But I can see them with the specs. 
 - You don't need them.

19:27.400 --> 19:29.160
I see them, too.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.760
This isn't funny. 
 This isn't happening.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.240
Do something.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.720
I don't believe it. 
 This stuff is really real.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.560
Finish the spell and close 
 the window, send them back!

19:41.560 --> 19:44.440
I... Here!

19:44.440 --> 19:47.320
This one. 
 The cosmic seal. Ha ha!

19:47.320 --> 19:49.840
- This is it. 
 - Well, read it, Sardo.

19:49.840 --> 19:53.520
- It's Sar-Do! 
 - Who cares? Just read it.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.280
All right, all right.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.720
The spell of the cosmic seal.

19:57.720 --> 20:02.040
Nimbo rombus...

20:02.040 --> 20:04.400
rondo cane!

20:06.120 --> 20:09.320
Favel dinkum...

20:09.320 --> 20:13.040
flux moa! Go away!

20:21.760 --> 20:23.360
What happened?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.160
I think we did it.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.720
Yeah.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.280
Well, there was 
 no cause to be worried.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.800
I had everything under control.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.000
- You know, magic is very much... 
 - Wait.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.320
Oh, my...

20:43.320 --> 20:47.000
- Maybe we didn't do it after all. 
 - What is it?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.120
Aahhhh!

20:49.400 --> 20:51.480
Take the children!

20:52.720 --> 20:55.800
You have tampered 
 with the cosmic seal.

20:55.800 --> 21:00.320
2 universes cannot exist 
 on the same plane.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.560
Balance must be restored.

21:02.560 --> 21:05.040
Glox moray...

21:05.040 --> 21:08.400
Glox moray...

21:18.760 --> 21:23.080
- What is this? 
 - I don't know!

21:32.160 --> 21:34.320
Aaahhhh!

21:44.240 --> 21:46.880
You did it. 
 You closed the window.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.560
Does that mean 
 the ghosts are gone?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.080
There were no ghosts, darling.

21:50.080 --> 21:52.840
You opened a window 
 into a parallel universe.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.640
There was a parallel 
 universe in my house?

21:55.640 --> 21:58.640
Yes, but I closed the window.

22:00.200 --> 22:04.400
Funny thing is they were 
 trying to get rid of you, too.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.920
Are they gone for good?

22:05.920 --> 22:09.080
I don't think they'll be 
 bothering you anymore.

22:19.600 --> 22:20.840
Oh, man.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.960
- No way. 
 - Excellent.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.600
So 2 universes were fighting 
 for the same space?

22:27.600 --> 22:29.800
- And the other universe won? 
 - Exactly.

22:29.800 --> 22:34.440
'Cause the woman in black was 
 powerful, and Sardo was a fake.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.960
That's Sar-Do. 
 Accent on the "Do."

22:36.960 --> 22:38.720
Ha ha. Great story.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.920
And here's why I was late.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.800
Super specs!

22:44.800 --> 22:47.200
I got one for everybody 
 as an April Fool's gift.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.480
Didn't cast any spells 
 on 'em, did you?

22:50.480 --> 22:52.280
No, don't worry. 
 They're safe.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.080
Now, when I count 3.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.880
Everybody put 'em on.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.160
1... 2...

22:58.160 --> 22:58.660
3.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.560
- Aaahhh! 
 - [everyone screaming]

23:13.480 --> 23:17.440
Well, guess your story 
 was scary enough tonight.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.480
Guess so.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.840
April Fool's.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.760
- April Fool's. 
 - April Fool's.
