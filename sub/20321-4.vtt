- Where's the manager?
- Right here.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.459
We've got to make sure these lockers don't
contain anything combustible.

00:17.579 --> 00:19.248
I need them open.

00:22.138 --> 00:24.339
Gimme that.

Number one guaranteed way
of dealing with stress.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.628
I don't think I'm gonna
make it all the way home.

01:07.662 --> 01:09.830
Come on, I know you're working
hard, but it can't be that bad.

01:09.864 --> 01:11.832
It's easy for you to say.
Management's killing me.

01:11.866 --> 01:14.468
You're management!
What are you talking about?

01:14.502 --> 01:16.636
Toby, we got 100 new patients
coming through every single day,

01:16.670 --> 01:18.605
and I'm the one that has
to make sure it doesn't go

01:18.672 --> 01:20.640
off the rails.
Can we please stop?

01:20.674 --> 01:22.609
You gotta chill, Oz.

01:22.676 --> 01:24.777
This is the job you signed up
for. You're not EMS anymore.

01:24.845 --> 01:26.279
You don't understand, ok?

01:26.347 --> 01:28.314
Those patients are being
brought in by our people.

01:28.348 --> 01:30.316
If one of them screws up,
I'm the one that has to act.

01:30.383 --> 01:32.351
I gotta take 'em to Ryder,
maybe I got to get 'em fired.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.353
The responsibility is
crushing me.

01:34.387 --> 01:35.887
You got the shoulders for it.

01:35.955 --> 01:37.923
I'm high. You got
the runner's high?

01:37.957 --> 01:39.891
I got the runner
want-to-throw-up.

01:39.959 --> 01:42.828
All right. You gotta
cross that edge, you know?

01:42.895 --> 01:45.696
- I crossed it hours ago.
- Agh.

01:45.764 --> 01:48.733
Mmm.

01:48.767 --> 01:50.768
Mmm.

01:50.836 --> 01:52.570
I...

01:52.605 --> 01:54.705
Could get used to this.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.674
It's all part of my plan
to distract you

01:56.742 --> 02:00.844
from those murderers and spies
and... tax evaders

02:00.911 --> 02:04.114
and get you addicted to pleasure
and keep you for myself.

02:04.182 --> 02:06.783
You do realize I don't
actually catch tax evaders,

02:06.851 --> 02:09.886
- right?
- You don't?

02:09.954 --> 02:12.856
- You know what I mean.
- I don't think I do.

02:12.923 --> 02:14.858
I think you need to maybe
try again.

02:14.925 --> 02:17.160
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.898
You're right, what is it
that I actually do?

02:28.372 --> 02:31.374
You know, we've got
to enjoy this while we can.

02:31.408 --> 02:33.475
Who knows how long it'll be
until we have a little rug rat

02:33.543 --> 02:36.611
jumping on the bed just when we
want to have some quality time?

02:36.646 --> 02:38.980
Where did that come from?

02:39.048 --> 02:40.915
I don't know.

02:43.486 --> 02:45.787
I just thought you and I should
have a kid someday, no?

02:45.821 --> 02:47.789
Are you serious?

02:47.856 --> 02:49.990
You're serious right now,
aren't you?

02:50.058 --> 02:53.627
Yeah. No?

02:53.662 --> 02:56.930
I don't know. I mean,
I've... I never...

02:56.998 --> 03:01.335
Us... parents?

03:01.369 --> 03:03.437
Happens all the time, Mich.

03:05.406 --> 03:07.039
Why not for us?

03:09.042 --> 03:12.245
Is that you, or me?

03:12.313 --> 03:16.015
It's you.

03:16.049 --> 03:18.284
Ten bucks says it's Klein.

03:18.319 --> 03:20.586
Ah, yes. Yep?

03:23.823 --> 03:27.693
Ok. Yes, I'm...
I'm on my way in.

03:27.727 --> 03:29.294
Bye.

03:31.530 --> 03:33.598
Saved by the bell.

03:33.632 --> 03:35.099
It's work.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.101
Oh, I know.

03:37.135 --> 03:39.403
We should talk
about this, though.

03:41.340 --> 03:44.141
- We'll talk.
- Oh, we'll do more than that.

03:57.221 --> 04:00.189
Ok, we're responding
to a direct request from CSIS.

04:00.224 --> 04:02.258
A John Doe was discovered
in a storage unit,

04:02.292 --> 04:04.760
murdered, apparently.
It was rented under a false ID

04:04.794 --> 04:07.429
and paid for a year in advance
in cash.

04:07.464 --> 04:09.431
What does that have to do
with us?

04:09.466 --> 04:11.433
Well, the unit was full
of stolen goods,

04:11.468 --> 04:13.769
including this laptop,
which belongs to the CEO

04:13.803 --> 04:16.605
of Optican Informatics,
Lorraine Browning.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.906
Well, since when do we deal
with stolen laptops?

04:18.974 --> 04:22.410
Browning's company is one of the fastest
growing defense contractors on the continent.

04:22.444 --> 04:25.680
She's got four open contracts for
the Department of National Defense.

04:25.748 --> 04:29.950
We believe that that laptop contains secrets
that are vital to national security.

04:30.018 --> 04:32.052
But we have the computer
right here.

04:32.087 --> 04:36.156
What I didn't tell you is that in her robbery
report, she never declared it missing.

04:36.223 --> 04:38.258
Now CSIS and the DND want
to know why.

04:38.293 --> 04:42.228
So far, investigations have revealed that
none of the intelligence is compromised,

04:42.297 --> 04:44.798
but we're gonna have Dev do
a more detailed investigation.

04:44.832 --> 04:47.434
So you think this murder has
something to do with it.

04:47.502 --> 04:50.736
Well, until we can prove it doesn't,
let's assume that it does, ok?

04:50.771 --> 04:53.739
- Dev, present for you.
- Ooh.

04:53.807 --> 04:55.675
Anything on the contents
of that storage unit?

04:55.742 --> 04:59.445
Our people are fingerprinting the stolen goods.
Hopefully they can ID the thief.

04:59.479 --> 05:02.415
- What about the victim?
- We're still waiting on autopsy results,

05:02.482 --> 05:04.750
but with no visible signs
of violence, I'm thinking

05:04.818 --> 05:07.352
that maybe he was reaching in
for a cherry freeze pop,

05:07.420 --> 05:10.422
- and just sort of fell in?
- Ok, we need to find out

05:10.456 --> 05:12.281
who had access to that computer
and what they might have

05:12.401 --> 05:13.972
got from it.
As for you two...

05:14.092 --> 05:16.328
We find out why Browning hid
the fact that she lost

05:16.395 --> 05:18.596
sensitive government tech
and did not report it.

05:18.664 --> 05:22.566
- That's just what I was gonna say.
- That's just what we'll do.

05:30.141 --> 05:33.076
You and your wife have
a lovely home, Mr. Van Sant.

05:33.144 --> 05:35.446
Thank you.
You can call me Tom.

05:35.513 --> 05:38.648
My wife is expecting you.
Lorraine.

05:38.682 --> 05:40.783
Ms. Browning. I'm
sergeant McCluskey. This is

05:40.851 --> 05:42.819
- Special Consultant Logan.
- Hello.

05:42.886 --> 05:45.054
Oh, when we had the break-in,
one officer came

05:45.121 --> 05:47.890
and asked us five questions, and
we never heard from him again.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.460
You find my laptop, and suddenly
we have two detectives?

05:50.494 --> 05:52.294
There was also a dead body
found at the scene.

05:52.363 --> 05:54.563
Lucky we weren't home
when we were robbed.

05:54.597 --> 05:56.765
We don't know who the victim
is or why he was killed.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.645
We're hoping that you
can help us with this.

05:58.765 --> 05:59.982
Why would we know?

06:00.102 --> 06:01.159
Can we speak privately?

06:01.279 --> 06:04.406
My husband and executive assistant
can hear anything.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.742
- I'm sorry, you are?
- Charlie Satie.

06:06.776 --> 06:09.478
I've been with Ms. Browning
for the last six years.

06:09.545 --> 06:11.479
The government is concerned
that information

06:11.513 --> 06:13.158
from your laptop may
have been compromised.

06:13.278 --> 06:14.396
The device is encrypted

06:14.516 --> 06:16.484
with military-grade
cryptographic security.

06:16.551 --> 06:19.420
It's unlikely someone who's stealing
silverware could break into it.

06:19.454 --> 06:22.490
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

06:22.524 --> 06:24.492
- Who is he?
- He's the victim.

06:24.526 --> 06:26.526
He was found in a freezer
in the thief's locker.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.863
- The thief is also a murderer?
- Why didn't you report the theft?

06:29.897 --> 06:32.231
My computer's a brick
without the passwords.

06:32.266 --> 06:36.135
I had a new device the next day.
<i>I need to get it back.</i>

06:36.169 --> 06:38.337
What else of my things were you
able to recover?

06:38.372 --> 06:41.841
- So far, just the laptop.
- I thought you were bringing it back.

06:41.876 --> 06:43.842
As soon as forensics is
through with it, yes.

06:43.877 --> 06:46.512
It doesn't seem like it's
that important to you, though.

06:46.546 --> 06:50.049
I had family photos that I didn't back up.
I'd like to have them.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.818
Is there anything
on the computer that has to do

06:52.852 --> 06:55.321
with Optican Informatics' work
for the Federal Government?

07:02.528 --> 07:04.862
All classified information is
on an internal network.

07:04.897 --> 07:06.864
It can't be accessed
without my passwords.

07:06.899 --> 07:09.935
Is it possible the information could
be transferred to an SD card?

07:10.002 --> 07:11.903
- You're saying you found a data card?
- No.

07:11.938 --> 07:14.806
Was there a card in the computer
at the time of the theft?

07:14.840 --> 07:17.474
No. I just don't understand
your line of questioning.

07:17.508 --> 07:20.177
You'll have to excuse
Ms. Browning. She needs to leave

07:20.211 --> 07:23.080
for a business meeting
in five minutes.

07:23.114 --> 07:26.616
Thank you.

07:31.455 --> 07:34.390
She doesn't know the dead guy. Mostly
she was upset about the laptop.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.326
Why did you ask
about the SD card?

07:36.393 --> 07:38.394
When you asked her about
sensitive information, I saw her

07:38.514 --> 07:39.767
put an SD card into a laptop.

07:39.887 --> 07:41.764
I saw spreadsheets,
figures... I couldn't figure it out.

07:41.798 --> 07:44.100
- So Lorraine Browning is lying.
- Yeah.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.269
We need to figure out why.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.909
Did we get anything
from Browning's laptop?

07:54.944 --> 07:58.546
Emails, corporate PR,
accounting details...

07:58.581 --> 08:01.383
Absolutely nothing for anyone
to be killed over, though.

08:01.417 --> 08:04.352
But she was right.
The security was top-notch.

08:04.453 --> 08:06.820
I mean, I had to use
a high-level brute-force

08:06.888 --> 08:08.856
cracking algorithm
just to get into it.

08:08.890 --> 08:11.058
- So the thief didn't get in?
- No.

08:11.126 --> 08:13.060
But someone sure tried
pretty hard.

08:13.128 --> 08:15.096
Dev, she was also worried
about an SD card.

08:15.130 --> 08:17.064
Yeah, yeah. When I was
checking the buffers,

08:17.132 --> 08:19.065
I noticed that one had been
inserted into the laptop.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.950
But its contents weren't
saved to the hard drive,

08:21.070 --> 08:22.750
so whatever's on it
is still a mystery.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.038
Something she was concerned
about. What is she hiding?

08:25.106 --> 08:27.640
Dev, can you find out more
about the projects

08:27.708 --> 08:29.642
Browning's company is working on
for the DND? I mean,

08:29.710 --> 08:32.529
whatever is on that card has to
be incredibly important.

08:32.649 --> 08:33.659
Yeah.

08:33.780 --> 08:36.215
So, our man in the freezer,
he was wearing glasses.

08:36.282 --> 08:38.217
They were Trephani frames.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.152
Only four stores in the city
carry them.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.489
I sent his prescription out a little
while ago. This looks like I got a hit.

08:43.556 --> 08:46.425
Meet... Nick Markussen.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.060
Yeah,

08:48.128 --> 08:50.562
that's our boy.
He's married.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.997
So, what, his wife didn't put
out a missing persons report?

08:53.065 --> 08:54.932
Maybe she's not missing him.

09:08.246 --> 09:10.780
- Paula King?
- Yeah?

09:10.848 --> 09:13.750
- IIB.
- What's going on?

09:13.784 --> 09:17.120
We need to speak with you privately.
It's about your husband.

09:17.155 --> 09:19.289
Paula, if you need me
to stay...

09:19.323 --> 09:21.391
Um, I'll be ok, Mike.

09:25.062 --> 09:27.129
Call me.

09:29.366 --> 09:30.933
Can we speak with you inside?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.069
Uh, yeah.

09:36.540 --> 09:38.874
We're sorry to have
to bring you this news.

09:38.942 --> 09:40.841
Your husband was murdered.

09:40.876 --> 09:43.344
His body was found
early this morning.

09:43.379 --> 09:47.215
- Where? In Mexico?
- Here.

09:47.249 --> 09:48.849
In a storage locker.

09:48.884 --> 09:51.819
Oh, my God.

09:51.853 --> 09:54.522
When was the last time
you saw him?

09:54.557 --> 09:56.856
Six months ago.
He went out to work,

09:56.891 --> 09:58.858
and I got a text.
It said,

09:58.893 --> 10:01.595
"Goodbye. It's over.
Keep the house".

10:01.629 --> 10:04.498
That was it.
I never saw him again.

10:04.532 --> 10:08.168
<i>All this time,</i>
<i>I thought he left me.</i>

10:08.203 --> 10:10.971
You thought that he was
in Mexico?

10:11.005 --> 10:14.773
He talked a lot about packing
it in and going down to Baja,

10:14.808 --> 10:17.110
and the Mohawk Police found
his car parked

10:17.144 --> 10:19.278
on the Akwesasne Reserve
the next day.

10:19.313 --> 10:22.148
I just figured he was
on his way South.

10:22.182 --> 10:26.085
He'd been distant
in the last couple of years.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.086
Some nights, he wouldn't come
home, wouldn't say where he was.

10:28.121 --> 10:30.422
I got the text and just figured
he'd moved on.

10:30.490 --> 10:32.724
- I moved on too.
- Well, it's possible

10:32.758 --> 10:34.226
he never sent the text.

10:34.260 --> 10:36.528
Whoever killed him might have
sent it to cover it up.

10:36.562 --> 10:38.029
Do you know who killed him?

10:38.063 --> 10:40.098
- No.
- We believe the killer may have

10:40.133 --> 10:42.601
committed a series
of home thefts,

10:42.635 --> 10:45.802
possibly someone Nick knew
or was in contact with.

10:45.870 --> 10:47.438
Did he have any enemies?

10:47.472 --> 10:49.940
He hardly had any real friends.

10:49.974 --> 10:51.742
He worked all the time.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.345
You could ask his boss
at the mortgage company,

10:54.379 --> 10:56.313
but he didn't know anything
when I called him.

10:56.381 --> 10:58.715
- What's his boss' name?
- Roger London.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.951
London Mortgage Group.
<i>What the hell is he up to?</i>

11:01.985 --> 11:04.720
<i>Even after he's dead,</i>
<i>he's keeping secrets.</i>

11:04.788 --> 11:06.922
Who was the man outside?

11:06.990 --> 11:10.426
Mike. Mike Sexton.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.595
Did Nick and Mike know
each other?

11:12.663 --> 11:16.097
No. We met a month after Nick left.
I was walking my dog in the park,

11:16.166 --> 11:18.933
and we just started talking.
He's a good guy.

11:19.001 --> 11:21.470
Actually talks to me...
nothing like Nick.

11:21.504 --> 11:25.440
Well, we're sorry to have
brought you the news.

11:25.508 --> 11:29.678
If you can think of anything
else, please give us a call.

11:46.027 --> 11:48.556
Ok, so, maybe Markussen was
having an affair.

11:48.676 --> 11:51.464
Right. He's at his girlfriend's
house when it gets robbed,

11:51.532 --> 11:53.433
he confronts the thief,
loses the battle,

11:53.501 --> 11:56.436
ends up getting stuffed into a
locker with all the merchandise.

11:56.470 --> 12:00.340
The cheating husband winds up dead, you
know who's usually responsible, right?

12:00.408 --> 12:02.342
You know, I read Paula
when she found out he was dead,

12:02.410 --> 12:03.843
and she seemed genuine.

12:03.877 --> 12:06.112
As far as I can see,
she's telling the truth.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.114
Well, she certainly got
over him fast.

12:08.182 --> 12:11.150
I mean, what, she started seeing him
a month after Nick disappeared?

12:11.218 --> 12:14.854
So how long does someone have to wait
when they've been abandoned? And besides,

12:14.888 --> 12:18.157
you think that she could actually kill him
and physically stuff him into the locker?

12:18.225 --> 12:19.791
I don't know.

12:19.859 --> 12:22.327
Clark.

12:22.361 --> 12:24.329
So, Paula king was seeing
a guy named Mike Sexton.

12:24.396 --> 12:26.331
I need you to run down
his particulars.

12:26.365 --> 12:28.767
- With all my free time, right?
- Dev.

12:28.801 --> 12:31.002
<i>Ok, ok. There's something
that you need to know.</i>

12:31.037 --> 12:33.772
I compared Nick Markussen's
driver's license signature

12:33.806 --> 12:35.774
with the application
to rent the storage locker,

12:35.808 --> 12:37.975
<i>- and they match.</i>
- Nick rented the locker?

12:38.009 --> 12:41.613
Yeah. And his fingerprints were all
over the stolen goods inside of it.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.449
So he's not only our victim;
he's our thief.

12:52.659 --> 12:54.959
So, Nick steals a locker

12:54.993 --> 12:57.628
- full of valuables.
- Over a twelvemonth period

12:57.663 --> 13:00.798
until his disappearance
in June of this year.

13:00.832 --> 13:03.634
And then he winds up dead
and stuffed into a freezer.

13:03.669 --> 13:07.372
So, why does somebody kill Nick but
not take any of the valuables?

13:07.406 --> 13:10.307
My gut is telling me that it has
something to do with that SD card.

13:10.341 --> 13:12.309
I've been looking
for a connection

13:12.343 --> 13:14.945
to security-sensitive projects
that Lorraine's company has been

13:14.979 --> 13:17.581
working on. Two of them are
military telecom systems,

13:17.615 --> 13:20.117
another one is a robotics
weapons control system,

13:20.151 --> 13:22.119
and another two,
missile guidance systems.

13:22.153 --> 13:24.988
I'm still checking to see if any of this
stuff has been spotted out in the wild.

13:25.022 --> 13:28.091
Ok, what about the storage place? Is there
anything from the surveillance footage?

13:28.125 --> 13:31.427
No, it was a dead end. The security cameras
are erased every 10 days. However,

13:31.462 --> 13:34.297
what we do know is that
somebody had the codes to get

13:34.331 --> 13:37.266
- in and out of that locker.
- Meaning the killer must have known Nick.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.781
Paula mentioned that Nick
hung out with his boss.

13:39.901 --> 13:41.617
What do we have with
Nick's boss?

13:46.375 --> 13:47.809
Roger London.

13:47.876 --> 13:50.178
He was charged with battery
about three years ago.

13:50.213 --> 13:52.080
He had to do a year
of anger management classes.

13:52.115 --> 13:55.217
Maybe he knew about Nick's side business.
Maybe he was a part of it.

13:55.284 --> 13:58.285
Maybe Roger's anger-management
problems got the best of Nick.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.187
Do we have an address?

14:05.360 --> 14:08.929
We specialize in second mortgages
on high-end properties.

14:08.997 --> 14:11.965
People who like to spend a bit more
than their six-figure paychecks?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.967
- Yeah, something like that.
- And what exactly did Nick do here?

14:15.035 --> 14:17.003
Well, he was
our property evaluator.

14:17.037 --> 14:19.972
Before I give out a cent, I need to know
that I'll be able to get it back eventually.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.475
Did any clients have
any problems with him?

14:22.543 --> 14:24.710
This business isn't
about making friends.

14:24.778 --> 14:26.712
Everybody thinks
that their homes are worth

14:26.780 --> 14:29.648
more than we value them at,
and we find up foreclosing

14:29.715 --> 14:32.384
on some of them,
but business is business, right?

14:32.452 --> 14:35.787
- Was he good at what he did?
- He knew what stuff was worth.

14:35.855 --> 14:38.857
He never gave me
a bad evaluation.

14:38.924 --> 14:41.160
Now, if you're asking if he was
the hardest worker ever,

14:41.227 --> 14:43.162
well, that's another question.

14:43.229 --> 14:45.396
Once, he was out on the road
doing evals, and he disappeared

14:45.464 --> 14:48.533
for half a day. Sometimes
he never showed up at all.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.701
When was the last time
he showed up for work?

14:50.769 --> 14:52.878
Well, he disappeared when
I was on vacation in Hawaii.

14:52.998 --> 14:54.219
I came back and
found him gone.

14:54.339 --> 14:56.541
He just left everything
in his office and vanished.

14:56.575 --> 14:57.918
Did you wonder where he went?

14:58.038 --> 14:59.991
He left me with over three weeks'
worth of assessments to

15:00.111 --> 15:02.145
get covered. I didn't have too
much time to worry about him.

15:02.213 --> 15:06.049
You don't seem to care that one
of your employees was murdered.

15:06.116 --> 15:09.319
He just worked here. He kept his private
life private, like a ghost. You know?

15:09.387 --> 15:11.655
It's hard to feel too much
for him.

15:11.689 --> 15:14.991
Did Nick have anything that could
suggest he was living beyond his means?

15:15.025 --> 15:16.826
Maybe another source of income?

15:16.894 --> 15:18.827
Look, the guy just worked here.

15:18.861 --> 15:20.529
I never noticed anything.

15:27.070 --> 15:30.539
Thank you for your time.
Be in touch.

15:32.842 --> 15:36.244
That's a nice watch.
Rolex, huh?

15:36.312 --> 15:38.045
<i>Roger London lied to us.</i>

15:38.080 --> 15:40.415
The Rolex he was wearing
he stole from Nick Markussen.

15:40.449 --> 15:43.050
- So London could be our killer.
- And Markussen's partner.

15:43.085 --> 15:45.186
Think about it, you know.
"We're property evaluators"...

15:45.221 --> 15:47.188
That's great cover
for a couple thieves.

15:47.223 --> 15:50.290
Markussen scopes out the houses and
then brings the information to London.

15:50.325 --> 15:53.961
They recon it, they rob the place, then
they put the goods into a storage locker.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.897
But London doesn't want to share,
and that sounds like motive.

15:56.932 --> 15:58.899
He takes the car,
he drops it off at the reserve,

15:58.934 --> 16:00.400
he hops a flight to Hawaii,

16:00.435 --> 16:02.870
and then he sends a text
to the wife for an alibi.

16:02.904 --> 16:05.039
I'll have Dev look into them.

16:08.976 --> 16:10.777
Ok, guys, interesting news.

16:10.811 --> 16:12.779
I have checked into all
of Markussen's robberies,

16:12.813 --> 16:15.137
and they were all within a block and
a half of his property assessments.

16:15.257 --> 16:16.296
That is interesting.

16:16.416 --> 16:19.886
So maybe the job was just a front
for him to scope out targets to rob.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.487
- Seems like.
- Ok, I need Metro's itemized

16:22.521 --> 16:24.489
list of all of the stolen goods
that are still missing.

16:24.523 --> 16:26.491
So if any of those items
show up,

16:26.525 --> 16:28.560
maybe that'll give us a glimpse
into Nick's secret life.

16:28.594 --> 16:30.262
I'll make up an alert

16:30.296 --> 16:32.756
to send out to pawn shops
and antique dealers.

16:32.876 --> 16:36.769
I saw Roger London wearing a Rolex watch
that I think he stole from Nick.

16:36.803 --> 16:40.972
So you think that London
killed Markussen now?

16:41.006 --> 16:43.875
Well, he's definitely
a suspect,

16:43.942 --> 16:47.211
along with Lorraine Browning
and her husband.

16:47.279 --> 16:50.481
Ok, her maybe, but the husband
is a world-class surgeon.

16:50.515 --> 16:52.483
He funds hospitals in Haiti.

16:52.517 --> 16:55.518
In fact, he was there at the time
of Markussen's disappearance.

16:55.552 --> 16:59.222
Well, the thing we know is
that Lorraine Browning is

16:59.290 --> 17:03.193
missing the SD card that was
stolen with her computer,

17:03.227 --> 17:05.228
and whatever is
on that SD card,

17:05.296 --> 17:09.665
- she is desperate to get it back.
- Ok, well,

17:09.700 --> 17:12.501
for what it's worth,
the autopsy results came in.

17:12.535 --> 17:15.215
Ok, Markussen's death may have
not been planned.

17:15.336 --> 17:16.065
What?

17:16.185 --> 17:18.540
The victim fell or was hit
in the left temple,

17:18.574 --> 17:21.143
and the shape and the placement
of the bruising,

17:21.178 --> 17:22.845
they match a chest that was
found in the locker,

17:22.878 --> 17:24.847
so he could have been
in a scuffle,

17:24.915 --> 17:26.848
or he could have just slipped
and fell and hit his head.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.883
Yeah, it ruptured
his middle meningeal artery,

17:28.918 --> 17:30.852
and the blood pushes
against the dura matter,

17:30.920 --> 17:34.055
and he dies of epidural
haematoma. It doesn't take much.

17:34.123 --> 17:36.124
See? So it could have been
an accident.

17:36.244 --> 17:37.001
All right,
we'll look into it.

17:37.121 --> 17:39.341
Even if it was an accident,
someone still hid the body.

17:39.461 --> 17:42.230
Ok, you read that Markussen had
stuff hidden all over

17:42.298 --> 17:44.164
his office, right? Maybe he did
the same thing at home.

17:44.232 --> 17:46.166
From what I read, but I don't
think his wife knew about it.

17:46.234 --> 17:50.204
Well, he wasn't big on sharing. I think it's
worth it to do a once-over of her house.

17:50.271 --> 17:53.374
Which means, Dev, we're gonna
need a search warrant.

17:53.442 --> 17:55.576
Oz, hey.

17:55.696 --> 17:56.632
Hey, Toby, what's up?

17:56.752 --> 17:58.812
<i>Look we had a death from
an epidural haematoma.</i>

17:58.846 --> 18:01.548
Can you give me
Dr. Sonda's number?

18:01.615 --> 18:03.916
Oh, yeah, sure,
I can get that for ya.

18:03.984 --> 18:06.085
Hey, let me get you that number.
I'll call you back, ok?

18:06.153 --> 18:08.087
All right, bye.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.533
Hey, what gives? You dropped off your
patient an hour ago.

18:11.653 --> 18:12.944
You're supposed to be
back on the road.

18:13.064 --> 18:15.007
Just needed a little down time.
It's all good.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.731
It's all good? Is that what you want me
to tell the people waiting for a pickup?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.600
You know, I've already had
a complaint about you this week.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.435
I don't want to have to talk
to your supervisor.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.237
Aw, come on, you got my back,
right, Ozzie?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.539
First of all, don't call me
Ozzie. And second,

18:27.574 --> 18:29.941
we'll talk later. Ok, buddy?

18:29.976 --> 18:33.944
Oz, seriously, are you just gonna
let him get away with that?

18:34.012 --> 18:36.046
The hospital has to know
you're in charge.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.449
Yeah, but, you know,
we're friends too.

18:38.484 --> 18:39.851
I'm his boss. It's weird.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.853
Ok, but your job is
on the line. If you don't start

18:41.920 --> 18:44.455
acting like the boss,
people are gonna start

18:44.490 --> 18:46.590
- taking advantage of you.
- So what do you want me to do?

18:46.624 --> 18:50.694
Just toughen up.
You know? Take charge.

18:50.728 --> 18:53.062
Put on your big boy pants.

18:56.100 --> 18:57.567
Big boy pants?

18:57.602 --> 18:59.569
- Big boy pants.
- All right.

18:59.604 --> 19:02.405
Put on my big boy pants.
I like the sound of that.

19:02.439 --> 19:04.407
Big boy pants.

19:04.474 --> 19:07.242
Ok, upstairs bathroom's clear.

19:07.277 --> 19:09.745
Why are you people pulling
my house apart?

19:09.780 --> 19:11.917
Is there anything more
you can tell us about Nick

19:12.037 --> 19:13.463
in the days leading up to
his disappearance?

19:13.583 --> 19:17.119
- Any unusual behaviour?
- He was in a good mood.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.626
That's why it hurt
so much when he left.

19:18.746 --> 19:20.389
I thought he'd been happy
thinking about leaving me.

19:20.423 --> 19:23.258
- Now I don't know what to think.
- Did he have a safe deposit box?

19:23.293 --> 19:25.460
- Not that I know about.
- What about any other property?

19:25.494 --> 19:28.463
I don't know! Look, I told you. It's
like he had this whole other life.

19:28.497 --> 19:31.733
- What happened to his car?
- I sold it. Look, I have

19:31.767 --> 19:34.502
told you everything I know.
What else do you want from me?

19:34.537 --> 19:37.738
We think that Nick was
responsible for the thefts.

19:37.772 --> 19:41.475
Oh, my God.
<i>Where are you going?</i>

19:41.595 --> 19:43.008
Where did that money
come from?

19:43.128 --> 19:45.413
Don't worry about it, Paula.
I've got things under control.

19:47.649 --> 19:49.951
Paula.

19:49.985 --> 19:53.086
- I came as soon as I could.
- I can't believe this is happening.

19:53.154 --> 19:54.707
They're saying Nick was a thief.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.237
Don't you think she's been
through enough already?

19:56.357 --> 19:59.992
Hey. Been through the entire house.
Haven't found anything on the list.

20:00.026 --> 20:03.395
- Ok.
- What list? What are you looking for?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.431
We believe one of the things
he stole was a yellow and red

20:05.465 --> 20:08.100
SD card potentially containing
sensitive government documents.

20:08.134 --> 20:11.337
I might have seen it.
The day before he left.

20:11.404 --> 20:13.237
I didn't know what it was.

20:13.305 --> 20:15.440
I have it.

20:15.507 --> 20:19.143
This is gonna cost you.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.446
- Where is it?
- I only saw him with it once.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.082
He was talking to someone
on the phone asking for money.

20:24.149 --> 20:26.117
Well, think. You may have
seen it again.

20:26.151 --> 20:29.252
I didn't. I don't know what he was doing!
I don't want to know!

20:29.320 --> 20:32.655
Why is this happening?

20:32.723 --> 20:35.993
Remember in my read of Lorraine
Browning she wanted the SD card back?

20:36.113 --> 20:36.764
Yeah.

20:36.884 --> 20:39.529
Well, Paula saw Nick offering
the SD card to someone.

20:39.563 --> 20:41.698
So Nick extorted money
from Lorraine Browning.

20:41.732 --> 20:45.202
Potentially. I mean, it's the
best theory we've got so far.

20:53.443 --> 20:55.378
Ms. Browning,
you were in Ottawa

20:55.445 --> 20:58.715
- on June 12th last year?
- Two days of supplier meetings. Why?

20:58.782 --> 21:01.984
Do the names Nick Markussen
or Roger London ring a bell?

21:02.104 --> 21:03.092
No.

21:03.212 --> 21:05.587
Markussen is the man
we found in a freezer.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.891
We believe he stole your laptop
and the SD card that was in it.

21:08.958 --> 21:11.459
This is the second time you've
asked me about an SD card.

21:11.528 --> 21:14.329
I don't know what you're after.

21:14.397 --> 21:16.698
I just want it back.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.500
You're being blackmailed,
aren't you?

21:19.568 --> 21:22.102
- Where is this coming from?
- Look, we believe

21:22.170 --> 21:24.772
that sensitive information came
into Markussen's hands

21:24.840 --> 21:27.307
and he was trying to extort
money for its return.

21:27.375 --> 21:31.879
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>
<i>Can't find out about pack four.</i>

21:31.947 --> 21:35.448
This is absurd. I don't have
time for your espionage stories,

21:35.516 --> 21:37.784
and I don't have time
to be hauled in here

21:37.818 --> 21:41.187
at your every whim. If you'd
like to talk to me again,

21:41.221 --> 21:43.823
please contact my attorneys.

21:50.163 --> 21:53.098
She's lying.
She's being blackmailed.

21:53.132 --> 21:55.734
Which could mean that she had
a motive to kill Nick.

21:55.769 --> 21:57.502
Yeah.

22:04.871 --> 22:08.673
So, Browning lied about
her knowledge of the SD card

22:08.708 --> 22:10.508
and whatever information
it contained.

22:10.542 --> 22:12.510
Yeah, I got a confusing read
off of her.

22:12.544 --> 22:14.512
She was accusing someone
of doing something to her,

22:14.546 --> 22:16.514
and there was something
about "pack four".

22:16.548 --> 22:19.016
That could help us see
what was on the card, maybe.

22:19.050 --> 22:21.451
I'll run that
against Opticanâ€™s projects.

22:21.486 --> 22:25.688
Blackmail makes sense. If a missing card
proves that she compromised the DND,

22:25.723 --> 22:28.925
that would be ruin her company. Maybe
she killed Markussen to silence him.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.460
If she killed him, why is
the card still missing?

22:31.495 --> 22:33.830
Ok, well, your read
of the widow, Paula...

22:33.864 --> 22:36.799
She overheard Nick
on the phone demanding money

22:36.834 --> 22:39.936
for the return of something
that he stole.

22:39.970 --> 22:43.071
So the wife killed Nick in order to
take over the blackmail herself?

22:43.105 --> 22:46.474
She's still a suspect, but our
search didn't turn up the SD card.

22:46.509 --> 22:48.376
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

22:48.411 --> 22:51.212
You remember how Toby said
that Nick was a hider, right?

22:51.247 --> 22:54.182
So we went to the storage locker,
we looked at all the items,

22:54.250 --> 22:56.217
we even looked inside the items
to see if we could find it...

22:56.252 --> 22:58.519
maybe he'd hid it.
We didn't find anything.

22:58.587 --> 23:01.822
However, Metro sent me a list,

23:01.857 --> 23:04.525
and on this list were all
the items from the robberies.

23:04.560 --> 23:06.561
Now, these are the items
that were registered

23:06.595 --> 23:09.530
to insurance companies that didn't
show up in the storage locker.

23:09.598 --> 23:11.632
Now, wait for it. Wait for it.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.234
Does that look familiar?

23:15.335 --> 23:19.305
Yes. That is the Rolex that
Roger London stole from Nick.

23:19.373 --> 23:22.275
- Have Metro pick up London.
- I'm way ahead of you.

23:22.276 --> 23:25.045
They're already walking him
to interrogation as we speak.

23:37.527 --> 23:38.564
Where's my lawyer?

23:39.856 --> 23:42.843
- Look familiar?
- Never seen it before.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.049
Possession of stolen property.
We can start there.

23:45.169 --> 23:48.365
I found the watch.
I had no idea it was stolen.

23:57.910 --> 24:00.845
Yeah, you found the watch
in Nick Markussen's office.

24:00.913 --> 24:03.080
And when we asked you
if you knew anything

24:03.147 --> 24:05.015
about stolen goods he might
have had, you said no.

24:05.049 --> 24:08.619
He disappeared and left me
doing double duty for weeks, ok?

24:08.653 --> 24:09.639
I figured he owed me a watch.

24:09.759 --> 24:11.438
You want the watch back?
Take it.

24:11.506 --> 24:13.328
Did your relationship with Nick
extend outside of the office?

24:13.448 --> 24:18.078
No. I told you he kept to himself.
What am I being accused of here?

24:18.145 --> 24:20.847
Whoever killed Nick partnered
with him on the stolen goods.

24:20.882 --> 24:23.283
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I didn't kill anybody.

24:23.351 --> 24:27.720
You have an assault charge on your record.
Maybe you and Nick fought.

24:27.788 --> 24:30.423
- Maybe your temper got the best of you.
- No.

24:30.457 --> 24:32.425
When was the last time
you saw him?

24:32.493 --> 24:34.059
I don't know.

24:34.094 --> 24:36.828
In the office. He was going out
for an evaluation.

24:41.968 --> 24:44.203
Look, Nick and I weren't
friends,

24:44.271 --> 24:46.205
and we sure as hell weren't
partners,

24:46.239 --> 24:50.041
so if someone killed him,
it had nothing to do with me.

24:50.075 --> 24:54.312
Mr. London has made bail
on the possession charge.

24:54.346 --> 24:55.980
Finally.

25:04.356 --> 25:06.589
- Well?
- When I asked London

25:06.624 --> 25:08.959
when he last saw Nick,
he thought about the office.

25:08.993 --> 25:11.995
Meaning that he probably wasn't in the
storage unit when Markussen died.

25:12.030 --> 25:15.098
Well, maybe London found Nick
dead and put him in the freezer.

25:15.133 --> 25:17.100
It doesn't mean that he didn't
know about the card, though.

25:17.135 --> 25:20.503
But if he knew about the card,
why did the blackmail stop?

25:20.538 --> 25:22.771
And if Lorraine Browning
denies blackmail and she doesn't

25:22.806 --> 25:25.107
know Markussen, how do we prove
that London was involved?

25:25.142 --> 25:27.160
Maybe we don't need
Browning to talk

25:27.280 --> 25:28.758
if we get to the person who
knows the most about her.

25:28.878 --> 25:32.748
- Her husband.
- Her assistant.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.951
I was gonna say that.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.587
- Hey, Martha.
- Hi.

25:51.700 --> 25:53.668
Hey! Good morning.

25:53.702 --> 25:55.837
- You scared me, man. Geez.
- Oh, I did? I'm sorry.

25:55.871 --> 25:57.939
This is going
in your performance review.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.674
Dude, I was just resting.

25:59.708 --> 26:01.466
- Oh, you were resting.
- Yes.

26:01.586 --> 26:03.910
Well, in that case, I wouldn't want to
disturb you while you're resting.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.026
Are you kidding me?!

26:05.146 --> 26:07.314
This is your job.
Start taking it seriously.

26:07.349 --> 26:09.316
I do take it seriously.

26:09.351 --> 26:12.619
I'm gonna have
to file a report.

26:12.653 --> 26:15.321
Oz!

26:21.028 --> 26:23.663
Man, it's crazy. Paula king.

26:23.698 --> 26:26.331
Her world falls apart.

26:26.399 --> 26:28.333
She's married to this guy
for years,

26:28.401 --> 26:31.303
doesn't know who he really is.
It's insane.

26:31.337 --> 26:35.307
Most relationships end up in
disappointment one way or another.

26:35.375 --> 26:38.957
Sorry, I didn't drink
the optimist coffee

26:39.077 --> 26:42.179
- this morning like you did.
- I'm actually more of a realist.

26:42.247 --> 26:44.214
- Realist?
- Yes.

26:44.281 --> 26:47.017
So, ok, when it comes
to relationships,

26:47.051 --> 26:49.152
your glass is half empty?

26:49.220 --> 26:51.320
Half empty, half-full,
I don't know.

26:51.388 --> 26:53.689
The glass usually ends up
shattered anyways.

26:53.757 --> 26:56.191
Whoa. Ok,
so when I get married,

26:56.259 --> 26:58.113
I'm not inviting you
to make a speech.

26:58.233 --> 26:59.142
No?

26:59.262 --> 27:00.238
- No.
- Well, that's ok.

27:00.464 --> 27:02.733
I would probably just be
hanging out at the bar anyway.

27:02.767 --> 27:04.967
That's where probably I will
be, listening to everyone speak.

27:05.035 --> 27:08.804
Anyway, how's everything
with you and Adam?

27:10.774 --> 27:12.474
Are you...

27:12.542 --> 27:16.112
No, no. No, no. I'm just,
you know, I can tell.

27:16.146 --> 27:18.614
We've been working together
for a few years.

27:18.681 --> 27:20.282
Something's up.

27:20.350 --> 27:22.450
You know, you're lucky,
being able to read people.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.619
I wish I knew what was going on
in people's minds. It would

27:24.686 --> 27:26.621
- make life so much easier.
- Yeah, you would think,

27:26.655 --> 27:29.758
but it's kind of like the
opposite of making life easier.

27:29.792 --> 27:32.093
I couldn't even read
my girlfriend if I wanted to.

27:32.161 --> 27:35.296
Yeah, but there must be some reason for that.
Maybe she's an alien.

27:35.330 --> 27:38.966
She's definitely not an alien. I've checked.
She's got the human parts.

27:46.107 --> 27:48.242
Adam said something to me
this morning,

27:48.276 --> 27:52.445
and, I just, I wasn't sure
if he was joking.

27:52.513 --> 27:54.346
It's nothing.

27:54.414 --> 27:56.816
Doesn't sound like nothing.

27:56.850 --> 27:59.652
He said that he wanted
to have a baby.

27:59.772 --> 28:01.671
Awesome! That's great!

28:01.791 --> 28:03.923
What? No. I don't know.
I mean, I've never even

28:03.991 --> 28:05.925
thought about having a kid
in this job,

28:05.959 --> 28:09.961
- with the hours and then the risk.
- Is it that, or is it Adam?

28:09.996 --> 28:12.097
No, everything is fine
with Adam. Adam is great.

28:12.165 --> 28:16.301
I trust Adam. I just, I just
don't know if I'm ready.

28:20.339 --> 28:25.375
I can't stop thinking
about this SD card.

28:25.410 --> 28:27.778
Why did it disappear
when Markussen died?

28:27.813 --> 28:30.881
And more importantly,
where is it now?

29:23.232 --> 29:27.434
Get out of here
before I call the police!

29:40.817 --> 29:42.159
Mr. Satie?

29:46.383 --> 29:47.674
How can I help you?

29:47.794 --> 29:49.565
We know that your boss
was being blackmailed.

29:49.632 --> 29:53.736
She said you asked about it. She
also said she told you she wasn't.

29:53.804 --> 29:58.040
Well, we're asking you now. Do you
know of anyone threatening her?

29:58.108 --> 30:02.377
Ms. Browning's answer is
my answer.

30:02.445 --> 30:05.146
You'll get what you want.
Tell me where and when.

30:07.616 --> 30:09.517
It's started again.

30:09.585 --> 30:12.020
She was in Ottawa the night
the thief was murdered.

30:12.088 --> 30:13.621
Where were you that evening?

30:13.689 --> 30:16.424
I was with her.
You can check the travel memo.

30:16.491 --> 30:19.060
<i>They can't prove I drove back</i>
<i>that night.</i>

30:19.128 --> 30:21.629
You'd do anything to protect
her, wouldn't you, Mr. Satie?

30:21.663 --> 30:24.198
I'm loyal, if that's
what you're asking.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.133
I mean more than loyal.
I mean you would do

30:26.201 --> 30:28.202
anything to protect her
if she was threatened.

30:28.270 --> 30:31.105
I didn't kill anybody.

30:33.275 --> 30:35.276
If you don't mind,
I'm very busy. You can

30:35.310 --> 30:37.711
let yourselves out
the way you came in.

30:37.745 --> 30:39.412
Yeah, hello?

30:39.447 --> 30:41.414
He was in Toronto
the night Nick was killed.

30:41.482 --> 30:44.417
Why kill your blackmailer when you could
have your assistant do it for you?

30:44.452 --> 30:47.520
There's another thing. Lorraine got a call.
I think the blackmail has started again.

30:55.328 --> 30:58.597
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:58.632 --> 31:01.433
When I saw Lorraine's
blackmail phone call,

31:01.468 --> 31:03.769
yesterday's newspaper was
on the desk.

31:03.836 --> 31:06.772
So, if Nick the blackmailer is
dead, who's calling Lorraine now?

31:06.806 --> 31:09.774
I don't know. His partner? Who's that?
Is that Roger London?

31:09.808 --> 31:11.776
- Maybe.
- You know what?

31:11.810 --> 31:14.279
I might be able to help
with info from that call.

31:14.346 --> 31:17.515
See, I pulled up
her home phone records.

31:17.549 --> 31:19.016
Yeah?

31:19.050 --> 31:21.753
Most of the incoming calls
came from her office

31:21.787 --> 31:24.488
and her husband, but one.
One was from

31:24.522 --> 31:26.757
an unidentified number.
Now, the bad news is that it was

31:26.791 --> 31:29.025
a burner and it was shut off
right after the call.

31:29.059 --> 31:31.762
But the good news is if it comes back
on I can definitely get the location.

31:31.796 --> 31:34.431
- That's great.
- It's probably already in the trash.

31:34.465 --> 31:37.534
Last night two houses were
broken into. Fancy addresses.

31:37.568 --> 31:39.869
In one, nothing was taken.
In the other,

31:39.904 --> 31:44.540
19th-century silver candlesticks and an
18th-century French mantel clock were smashed.

31:44.574 --> 31:47.811
Metro ID'ed them from the report that
Dev made of the missing antiques.

31:47.845 --> 31:50.146
Somebody's looking
for something.

31:50.181 --> 31:52.816
- Or they found it.
- The mysterious SD card?

31:52.850 --> 31:55.384
Maybe not so mysterious.

31:55.419 --> 31:59.688
So, you remember Toby talking
about he heard "pack four".

31:59.722 --> 32:02.057
Now, it turns out that one of
the projects that Lorraine was

32:02.091 --> 32:06.795
working on for the DND was
codenamed P-A-C-4, PAC-4.

32:06.830 --> 32:09.998
It's a fully automated state-of-
the-art weapons guidance system.

32:10.033 --> 32:13.234
We're talking K.A. band
active radar-seeking technology.

32:13.268 --> 32:15.402
This is a revolutionary
improvement

32:15.437 --> 32:17.371
on target tracking
and discrimination.

32:17.439 --> 32:20.208
Why are you guys not as excited
about this as I am?

32:20.242 --> 32:22.543
Ok, this could be what
Browning was trying to sell.

32:22.577 --> 32:26.214
Yeah, or already sold. Ok, rumor
has it that the Chinese are

32:26.248 --> 32:28.182
bringing a similar product
to market very soon,

32:28.250 --> 32:31.985
and my inside sources say that it has
to be based on the Optician technology.

32:32.053 --> 32:34.721
That sounds like a reason
for blackmail and murder to me.

32:34.755 --> 32:37.123
There was a witness
at the break-in last night.

32:40.594 --> 32:42.562
It all happened so fast.

32:42.629 --> 32:44.497
I heard the crash and I thought

32:44.565 --> 32:47.166
my cat gotten onto the China
cabinet again.

32:47.234 --> 32:49.401
We know that you've already
spoken with the police, but if

32:49.435 --> 32:51.737
there's anything more you could
tell us about the intruder...

32:51.804 --> 32:53.772
Anybody tries that on me
again, they're gonna get

32:53.806 --> 32:56.041
the business end
of my knitting needle.

32:56.109 --> 32:59.644
- If you could give us a description.
- He was big.

33:01.914 --> 33:03.948
Did you have your glasses on
at the time?

33:04.016 --> 33:07.050
No, I tried to put them on,
but he hit me so fast.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.920
Do you remember where you bought
the clock and the candlesticks?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.923
There's a lovely shop
in Yorkville that I go to.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.559
Beno Fein antiques.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.730
Whew! Man, oh, man,

33:19.798 --> 33:23.099
I could murder some Mongolian
barbecue right about now, huh?

33:23.166 --> 33:26.035
Rick? Jimmy, you're in?

33:28.005 --> 33:30.740
Ok, what's going on here?
What's with the cold shoulder?

33:30.808 --> 33:32.241
What do you think?

33:32.309 --> 33:34.377
Oh, what are you,
in high school?

33:34.445 --> 33:37.881
I'm just doing my job, ok?
And if you were doing your job,

33:37.948 --> 33:41.049
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

33:41.117 --> 33:43.051
Hey, Toby, hey.
Hey.

33:43.119 --> 33:45.053
- You got a second?
- Yeah.

33:45.087 --> 33:47.255
- Oh, it'll just take a minute.
- Ok.

33:47.323 --> 33:49.257
- Nothing I'm doing is working.
- What is the problem?

33:49.325 --> 33:51.259
- You remember Perry?
- Yeah.

33:51.294 --> 33:53.261
Yeah, well, I caught him
sleeping at work yesterday.

33:53.329 --> 33:55.500
I tried to crack the whip, and now
the whole staff is turning on me.

33:55.620 --> 33:56.638
I don't know what else to do.

33:56.758 --> 33:59.066
Ok. Have you asked him
what the problem is?

33:59.134 --> 34:02.069
- No.
- He's always been a good paramedic, right?

34:02.103 --> 34:04.505
- Yeah.
- I'm sure there's a reason.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.507
- Ok, man?
- Ok. Cool, thanks.

34:06.575 --> 34:09.444
- Good to see you.
- You're welcome. Bye.

34:09.478 --> 34:12.277
Hey, Perry, hang on.
Hang on a sec.

34:14.248 --> 34:16.683
So, what's the problem?

34:16.717 --> 34:18.685
Obviously there's something
going on with you.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.020
Just talk to me and maybe
we can sort it out.

34:21.139 --> 34:22.583
You're not gonna be
able to solve this one.

34:22.703 --> 34:24.958
Try me.

34:25.025 --> 34:29.195
Jane lost her job. She was working
for this company. It went bust.

34:29.228 --> 34:31.530
She's self-employed,
so there's no unemployment.

34:31.565 --> 34:33.166
Geez, I had no idea.

34:33.199 --> 34:36.202
I've been working six hours
a day at a bakery to make it up.

34:36.235 --> 34:37.870
Why didn't you tell me?

34:37.904 --> 34:39.705
I didn't even know you baked.

34:39.739 --> 34:41.841
- You bake?
- I'll do whatever it takes.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.143
We got a mortgage.
And now it's not gonna get paid.

34:45.178 --> 34:47.212
What?

34:47.246 --> 34:48.981
Perry, that's...

34:55.521 --> 34:58.457
Hello? Hello?

34:58.491 --> 35:00.458
- Welcome!
- Hey.

35:00.492 --> 35:04.462
Let me guess. Newlyweds looking for
some fine pieces for your new home.

35:04.496 --> 35:07.564
- We're not together.
- Should be. You make a lovely couple.

35:07.599 --> 35:11.235
You sold these items
to Adele Tordai.

35:13.538 --> 35:15.505
She must be mistaken.

35:15.539 --> 35:20.410
This receipt says differently. You're
selling goods stolen by Nick Markussen.

35:20.444 --> 35:23.079
This is an elite establishment.

35:23.114 --> 35:26.582
I don't deal in stolen goods,
and I don't know any Markussen.

35:26.617 --> 35:28.851
Then who did you buy them from?

35:37.727 --> 35:42.364
That's one of the stolen items over there.
We know he was here looking for something.

35:42.432 --> 35:45.000
Whoever stole those has
already killed once, so you're

35:45.068 --> 35:47.602
looking at becoming
an accessory to murder.

35:47.637 --> 35:49.571
Ok.

35:49.639 --> 35:51.573
His name is Mark Douglas.

35:51.641 --> 35:53.608
He's the one
who sold me the goods.

35:53.643 --> 35:56.444
He works with another guy
who's a thief. Mark came here

35:56.478 --> 35:59.180
last night. He wanted to know
if I had anything left.

35:59.248 --> 36:03.117
It was just a few pieces, but he tore
them apart looking for something.

36:03.185 --> 36:06.119
- And did he find what he was looking for?
- No.

36:06.187 --> 36:09.590
Then he wanted to know the addresses of
where the rest of the things had ended up.

36:09.658 --> 36:11.525
Who's Mark Douglas?

36:21.635 --> 36:26.306
Mark Douglas is Mike Sexton,
Paula's new boyfriend.

36:26.374 --> 36:28.408
Thank you.

36:35.755 --> 36:39.859
- Nick's partner in crime was Mark Douglas.
- We know him as Mike Sexton.

36:39.979 --> 36:41.434
Yeah, he stole
the Mike Sexton ID.

36:41.554 --> 36:43.529
That's why he came up clean
when I first checked him out.

36:43.597 --> 36:44.576
And you like him
for the murder?

36:44.696 --> 36:47.832
Yeah. We think that he found
the SD card, got the idea

36:47.900 --> 36:49.834
for the extortion of Lorraine
Browning. He was going

36:49.902 --> 36:51.836
- to cut Douglas out of it.
- And now he's moving in

36:51.871 --> 36:53.905
on the widow of the man
he killed. That's dark.

36:53.973 --> 36:56.474
He got close to her to find
out where Nick was hiding it.

36:56.542 --> 37:00.578
It's been six months, he's developed actual
feelings for her, he calls the search off.

37:00.646 --> 37:02.579
And when you came around
and started asking questions

37:02.614 --> 37:05.383
about the SD card, he started
looking again.

37:05.450 --> 37:06.984
It's a dangerous game.

37:07.019 --> 37:08.986
Now he's probably going to try
to find the money and run.

37:09.054 --> 37:10.546
I'm still trying
to run down his location.

37:10.666 --> 37:13.424
In the meantime, stick with
the wife. If Douglas did it

37:13.458 --> 37:15.326
for her for some sick reason,
he might go back there.

37:15.360 --> 37:18.161
Ok, we'll head to the house.
Dev, put a tracker on her cell.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.795
Call us if she makes a move.

37:19.830 --> 37:21.797
Look, I found out
about the people

37:21.832 --> 37:24.000
who killed Nick.
Whatever he had, they think

37:24.035 --> 37:26.069
that we've got it. And they're
threatening to kill us.

37:26.103 --> 37:28.838
- We should call the police.
- No, we can't trust them.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.841
We can't trust anybody.
Paula, please.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.843
I love you.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.645
I don't want
to see you get hurt.

37:36.679 --> 37:38.647
Yeah.

37:38.681 --> 37:40.682
<i>Michelle, Metro checked
Mark Douglas' apartment.</i>

37:40.716 --> 37:43.152
<i>It was a dead end, but Paula's
cell phone is on the move.</i>

37:43.186 --> 37:45.387
- They could be together.
- Where is she now?

37:45.422 --> 37:48.424
<i>Moving onto Queen's Quay.
Hold it. It's pulling</i>

37:48.458 --> 37:50.659
<i>Into the parking structure
across from the terminal.</i>

37:50.693 --> 37:52.827
We're close. Have some units
meet us there.

37:54.764 --> 37:57.465
Still think Paula's innocent?

38:17.619 --> 38:19.587
Who are you?

38:19.621 --> 38:21.956
They told us
the blackmailer was dead.

38:25.193 --> 38:29.062
So it was you who killed him.
Show it to me.

38:29.130 --> 38:31.098
Open it.

38:43.376 --> 38:45.511
IIB! Stop!

38:49.082 --> 38:50.816
Ooh! Ugh!

38:53.820 --> 38:57.888
Mark Douglas, you're under arrest
for the murder of Nick Markussen.

38:57.956 --> 39:01.058
I didn't kill him.
We were supposed to be partners.

39:01.127 --> 39:04.762
I just wanted my share.
There was a struggle.

39:04.830 --> 39:07.765
He fell. I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

39:07.833 --> 39:10.001
So you romanced his wife?

39:10.035 --> 39:13.203
I just met her to find
whatever it was he was hiding.

39:13.271 --> 39:15.705
But then I got to know her.

39:15.773 --> 39:18.642
He was going to leave her
anyway.

39:24.616 --> 39:26.850
Paula, it's not what you think.

39:31.821 --> 39:34.390
I didn't mean to hurt her.
Please tell her.

39:34.458 --> 39:35.991
Watch your head.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.268
Douglas confessed.
He was the one

39:46.335 --> 39:48.270
- selling the stolen goods.
- Yeah, they argued

39:48.337 --> 39:50.905
over Nick's big score,
Nick fell, hit his head.

39:50.973 --> 39:53.275
Douglas gave us everything,
including the blackmail.

39:53.342 --> 39:55.960
Excuse me. Why am I still
being held?

39:56.080 --> 39:58.119
May I have my card and money?
I'd like to be out of here.

39:58.239 --> 40:02.449
You're not going anywhere, Ms. Browning.
We know what was on that card.

40:02.484 --> 40:06.453
And it implicates you in the illegal
sales of special-ops intel.

40:06.521 --> 40:09.790
Why would I sell out my company's
reputation for a few dollars?

40:15.230 --> 40:17.408
- What did you do?
- I'll handle it!

40:17.528 --> 40:18.598
<i>Lorraine!</i>

40:20.467 --> 40:23.301
You did this not because it would
damage you or your company;

40:23.421 --> 40:25.731
you did this 'cause the two
of you were lovers.

40:25.851 --> 40:28.040
You didn't want him
to go to prison.

40:28.108 --> 40:30.310
She used your computer,
she saw what was on the SD card.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.313
I told you.
My associate and I are done

40:33.380 --> 40:37.048
with your insinuations. My
lawyer will be here any moment.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.784
Lorraine...

40:39.852 --> 40:41.553
They have the card.

40:41.588 --> 40:44.889
I don't want you to be hurt
by this anymore.

40:44.924 --> 40:48.126
She didn't know anything
about it. It sounded so easy...

40:48.160 --> 40:51.062
Just transfer a few files
and I'd be set.

40:51.097 --> 40:54.632
When they took her computer and started
the calls, she just tried to help.

40:57.001 --> 40:59.537
I screwed everything up.

40:59.571 --> 41:01.539
I'm so sorry.

41:01.573 --> 41:04.709
Don't say another word.

41:04.743 --> 41:08.078
Why don't you make yourselves comfortable
while you wait for your representation?

41:08.113 --> 41:11.914
The crown prosecutor's office
is gonna be working overtime.

41:11.949 --> 41:14.851
See, I told you we'd take care
of this, Klein. Right?

41:22.560 --> 41:25.694
Hey, I didn't hear you
come in. You hungry?

41:25.729 --> 41:29.164
No, I am way too tired to eat.

41:29.232 --> 41:32.868
Yeah? Does that mean
you need help getting undressed?

41:32.902 --> 41:35.170
Maybe a little.

41:35.238 --> 41:36.805
Mmhmm.

41:39.242 --> 41:43.211
Ok, listen, I... I was
thinking about what you said.

41:43.246 --> 41:47.182
And, um...
before we have a kid,

41:47.250 --> 41:50.218
before we even talk
about having a kid,

41:50.253 --> 41:53.354
we need to talk.
About us.

41:53.422 --> 41:56.524
About you.

41:56.592 --> 41:58.325
That's fair.

42:00.262 --> 42:02.696
Baby steps, right?

42:02.764 --> 42:04.832
Baby steps.

42:10.605 --> 42:12.572
So, it was the assistant
the whole time.

42:12.607 --> 42:14.540
And they were having an affair?

42:14.608 --> 42:16.475
Having an affair.
I didn't even see it.

42:16.543 --> 42:18.511
- Sounds like quite the case.
- You look good, by the way.

42:18.545 --> 42:20.479
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah. Everything ok?

42:20.547 --> 42:22.481
Yeah, well, I talked to Perry.
Turns out he's been working

42:22.549 --> 42:25.484
two jobs because his wife got laid off
and they can't make their mortgage.

42:25.552 --> 42:26.948
- That's rough.
- Yeah.

42:27.068 --> 42:27.814
What can you do?

42:27.934 --> 42:30.422
I'll tell you what I did.
I put the word out,

42:30.489 --> 42:33.425
and now 20 EMS chipping in 100
bucks each to pay that mortgage.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.343
And next month I'm putting him
first priority for overtime.

42:35.463 --> 42:36.295
Nice.

42:36.415 --> 42:38.470
You know, I tried it your way.
I tried it Sandy's way.

42:38.590 --> 42:40.279
In the end,
I gotta do it my way.

42:40.399 --> 42:43.702
I almost don't recognize you. You got this
management style, like a swagger about you.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.703
All right. Less talky,
more joggy. Come on.

42:45.770 --> 42:48.039
All right. I'll give you
a three-second head start.

42:48.106 --> 42:51.175
Oh, I'm already tired.
I'm already tired. Ohhh!
